00:03.829 --> 00:05.570
<i>Quantum Leap was
an experimental</i>

00:05.570 --> 00:08.051
<i>time travel program
years away from being tested.</i>

00:08.051 --> 00:09.922
Why did you leap?
- I don't remember anything.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.446
Your name is Dr. Ben Song.

00:11.446 --> 00:13.404
<i>You're a time traveler
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:13.404 --> 00:15.145
<i>trying to put right
what once went wrong.</i>

00:15.145 --> 00:16.755
<i>I'm Addison Augustine.</i>
- Addison.

00:16.755 --> 00:19.062
You're the woman I love.

00:19.062 --> 00:21.064
Richard Martínez is Leaper X,

00:21.064 --> 00:22.544
another leaper from the future,

00:22.544 --> 00:24.154
<i>traveling through time,
just like Ben.</i>

00:24.154 --> 00:25.503
You made a serious miscalculation

00:25.503 --> 00:27.157
coming here, Ben.
- You want to help Ben?

00:27.157 --> 00:29.203
You will tell him
to trust no one.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.161
You say we have a mole,
and you know who it is?

00:31.161 --> 00:32.423
It's Ziggy.

00:32.423 --> 00:33.381
What?

00:33.381 --> 00:35.687
I'm here to help you.

00:35.687 --> 00:36.819
Not bad for a pacifist.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.125
Thanks for your help.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.083
No!

00:40.083 --> 00:41.171
You're a threat
to my greater mission.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.738
Goodbye, Ben.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.228
I said medium-well.

00:54.228 --> 00:57.057
That slice looks like it's
about to moo on my plate.

01:02.279 --> 01:03.976
Any day now, sweetheart.

01:03.976 --> 01:05.804
Can I get
another lobster, please?

01:05.804 --> 01:07.067
Fresh ashtray, ma'am?

01:07.067 --> 01:08.894
Freshen up my Rob Roy, dear.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.734
What do you mean,
shut Ziggy down?

01:22.734 --> 01:24.910
Martínez works
for Quantum Leap in the future.

01:24.910 --> 01:28.218
He has access to the same Ziggy
we're using now.

01:28.218 --> 01:30.829
So every move we make,
every word we utter,

01:30.829 --> 01:32.309
is being used against us.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.919
I mean, that--
that's how Martínez was able

01:33.919 --> 01:35.269
to stay one step ahead of us.

01:35.269 --> 01:37.488
If we have any hope
of stopping Martínez,

01:37.488 --> 01:39.708
we have to pull the plug now.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.753
Okay, first of all,
Ziggy doesn't have a plug.

01:41.753 --> 01:44.713
It is--it's thousands
of interconnected servers,

01:44.713 --> 01:45.844
cloud-based AI--

01:45.844 --> 01:47.803
Ian, don't take it personal.

01:47.803 --> 01:48.934
That's not what this is.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.110
I mean, it definitely is.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.328
No, no, no, no.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.765
This could debilitate us, okay?

01:53.765 --> 01:55.724
Ziggy runs all of our
probability analytics.

01:55.724 --> 01:58.030
It sorts through trillions
of data points

01:58.030 --> 02:00.772
in order to help find clues
to locate Ben on his leaps.

02:00.772 --> 02:03.732
And right now, we have no idea
where or when he is.

02:03.732 --> 02:05.255
You've found him before
without Ziggy.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.388
True, but that wasn't easy.

02:07.388 --> 02:10.434
And when we find him, you can
still use analog tools--

02:10.434 --> 02:12.523
Internet searches,
databases, message boards.

02:12.523 --> 02:14.438
Ben is nearing
his final leap.

02:14.438 --> 02:16.266
We need every single tool
that we have in our arsenal.

02:16.266 --> 02:17.963
Jenn, you're
the head of security.

02:17.963 --> 02:18.964
What do you think?

02:18.964 --> 02:20.009
The cautious move would be

02:20.009 --> 02:21.532
to cut Ziggy off,
at least for now.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.404
Ugh.
Sorry, everybody,

02:23.404 --> 02:26.189
I just have to get
this knife out of my back.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.234
Jenn is right.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.279
We can't take the risk.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.412
Pull the plug--plugs,

02:31.412 --> 02:34.676
whatever it takes
to shut it down.

02:57.612 --> 02:59.048
Sorry about that, folks.

02:59.048 --> 03:02.269
<i>Hopefully this turbulence
will be over real soon.</i>

03:02.269 --> 03:04.009
Okay.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.968
Let's try this again.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.234
I-I'm sorry.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.496
You had it right
the first time.

03:12.496 --> 03:16.108
Now this is too much grenadine.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.284
I'll make it again.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.984
Did you know ginger ale
tastes better on airplanes?

03:21.984 --> 03:23.246
They've done studies.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.508
It's--it's the drier air.
- Is that right?

03:24.508 --> 03:25.988
And it helps
with airsickness.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.250
Not--not that I get airsick.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.643
But when I'm taking
my flying lessons--

03:28.643 --> 03:30.035
did I mention
I take flying lessons?

03:30.035 --> 03:31.689
A couple times, yes.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.300
Can I--can I have
extra maraschino cherries?

03:33.300 --> 03:34.866
Holly always gives me three.

03:34.866 --> 03:37.086
She makes the stems
into flowers.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.740
Cory, go easy.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.785
It's her first
transatlantic run.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.091
I'll take it from here.

03:42.091 --> 03:43.745
Thank you.

03:45.660 --> 03:46.661
Addison?

03:47.792 --> 03:48.750
Addison?

03:49.794 --> 03:51.231
Addison?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.884
You there?

03:52.884 --> 03:53.885
Are you okay?

03:53.885 --> 03:55.191
You look a little
shell-shocked.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.889
Oh, I'm fine.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.717
The turbulence is just
throwing me.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.545
Well, these international
flights can get very bumpy,

04:01.545 --> 04:02.981
but you'll get used to it.

04:02.981 --> 04:05.201
Not sure I can get used
to how grabby the men are.

04:05.201 --> 04:06.376
Pretty sure 2C just left

04:06.376 --> 04:07.986
a handprint
on the back of my skirt.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.727
It's like they told us
in the Charm Farm--

04:09.727 --> 04:12.730
Service with a smile.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.341
Excuse me.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.864
You need some help
with your insulin, Zelda?

04:15.864 --> 04:16.995
Thank you, dear heart.

04:16.995 --> 04:19.389
The altitude flares up
her arthritis.

04:19.389 --> 04:20.869
You do a few of these
international flights,

04:20.869 --> 04:22.566
you'll never go back
to domestic.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.655
Planes are nicer,
the money is great,

04:24.655 --> 04:26.353
and you get to see the world.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.529
Isn't that worth
a few skirt chasers?

04:28.529 --> 04:29.660
I'm not sure.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.009
Give it time.
Hey, can you,

04:31.009 --> 04:33.795
uh, see if anyone upstairs
needs service?

04:33.795 --> 04:35.275
Right, upstairs.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.189
Okay.

04:50.507 --> 04:53.031
Charcuterie boards,

04:53.031 --> 04:54.337
caviar spread?

04:54.337 --> 04:55.686
Okay, I thought I was lucky

04:55.686 --> 04:57.645
to get extra corn chips
on my last flight.

04:57.645 --> 05:00.300
Addison, thank God.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.132
For a second there, I thought
I'd never see you again.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.047
Hey, Ben.

05:09.047 --> 05:12.268
No.

05:12.268 --> 05:14.575
You know, I was never worried.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.622
I have learned
that you don't win much

05:18.622 --> 05:20.232
betting against Ben Song.

05:20.232 --> 05:22.974
We go through
everything together, Addison.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.236
And when things go wrong,

05:24.236 --> 05:26.151
I know I'm not the only one
who gets hurt.

05:27.588 --> 05:30.547
I should have known
Martínez was gonna betray me.

05:30.547 --> 05:34.029
What if I'm getting
too trusting?

05:34.029 --> 05:36.945
Too trusting?

05:36.945 --> 05:39.556
Wow, I never thought
I'd hear you say those words.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.471
Okay.
Well, let's focus on this leap.

05:41.471 --> 05:43.647
What's Ziggy giving us?

05:43.647 --> 05:47.999
Uh, Magic took Ziggy offline.

05:47.999 --> 05:50.567
It's a security thing.
So we're running analog.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.003
Ziggy's gone,
but the handlink works?

05:52.003 --> 05:54.484
Yeah, apparently they work
on separate systems.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.007
It's a whole thing.
Ian explained it.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.095
I zoned out.

05:58.575 --> 05:59.533
Do you want the download
or not?

05:59.533 --> 06:01.230
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

06:01.230 --> 06:04.886
Uh, okay, it looks like
you are Lois Mitchell,

06:04.886 --> 06:06.191
uh, from Chicago.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.672
It is August 5th, 1971.

06:08.672 --> 06:11.109
Uh, you are on a flight
from London to New York,

06:11.109 --> 06:14.722
one of the first
in this brand-new line of 747s.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.767
But no idea why you're here.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.030
Mm. So we're flying blind.

06:21.468 --> 06:22.773
Apologies for the wordplay.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.340
- You're not sorry at all.
- Nope.

06:24.340 --> 06:25.689
Mm-hmm. Okay.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.561
Well, I will see
if Ian can pull a manifest.

06:27.561 --> 06:28.953
Do you know the flight number?

06:28.953 --> 06:30.128
Uh, yeah.

06:30.128 --> 06:31.434
Ooh, pockets.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.827
Cute dress.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.568
Thank you.

06:34.568 --> 06:37.484
Um, Transglobal Airlines,
flight number 349.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.444
Mm-hmm. I don't like that face.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.577
That's a bad face.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.840
Well, the good news is
we do not need Ziggy

06:45.840 --> 06:47.624
to find out why you're here.

06:47.624 --> 06:51.411
TGA flight 349 goes down
in the Atlantic tonight.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.805
Every one of these 366

06:54.805 --> 06:57.286
passengers and crew
are going to die.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.038
Look, for the record,

07:10.038 --> 07:11.735
racing against the clock
to try to figure out

07:11.735 --> 07:13.737
how to save this flight
is infinitely harder

07:13.737 --> 07:14.912
without Ziggy running probabilities.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.784
Your complaint is duly noted.

07:16.784 --> 07:20.352
Now, TGA 349 is one
of the most confounding

07:20.352 --> 07:21.702
airline crashes in history,

07:21.702 --> 07:22.746
and there were
so many unknowns.

07:22.746 --> 07:23.791
Let's start with the knowns.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.096
Any ideas why it went down?

07:25.096 --> 07:26.968
The leading theory
is weather.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.970
There was a vicious
electrical storm

07:28.970 --> 07:30.537
above the North Atlantic
that night,

07:30.537 --> 07:32.495
and a well-placed
lightning strike could have

07:32.495 --> 07:34.845
disabled fuel valves
or power feeders,

07:34.845 --> 07:36.499
electrical distribution systems.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.588
All this without Ziggy?
Not bad.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.111
"Air Disasters" had
a two-parter last night.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.200
You watch a TV show
called "Air Disasters"?

07:42.200 --> 07:44.115
Yeah, I like
to fall asleep to it.

07:44.115 --> 07:46.378
The pilot had
40 years' experience.

07:46.378 --> 07:48.946
It'd be unusual to lose
a plane that big to weather.

07:48.946 --> 07:51.514
Unless there was also
mechanical failure.

07:51.514 --> 07:55.475
Now, this variation of the 747
was fresh off the line.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.998
- Did they find a black box?
- No.

07:56.998 --> 07:59.783
Rescue crews spent months
scouring for the wreckage,

07:59.783 --> 08:01.350
but they only ever found
a part of the wing,

08:01.350 --> 08:02.960
never the rest of the fuselage.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.093
And then there--there wasn't
even a distress signal.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.791
I mean, the--the final
correspondence with ATC

08:07.791 --> 08:10.011
was an all clear at 10:08 p.m.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.621
And then the flight was never
heard from again.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.144
Which means we have
less than an hour

08:13.144 --> 08:14.798
to figure out
what crashes that plane,

08:14.798 --> 08:16.496
or everyone on it will die.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.758
Including Ben.

08:32.686 --> 08:35.079
Well, I'll ask the obvious--

08:35.079 --> 08:37.342
shouldn't we just make
an emergency landing?

08:37.342 --> 08:39.083
Oh, yeah? How am I supposed
to make that case?

08:39.083 --> 08:40.607
Captain, I know
my main function

08:40.607 --> 08:41.999
on this flight
is walking sex symbol,

08:41.999 --> 08:43.348
but let me explain
why you should divert

08:43.348 --> 08:45.394
hundreds of passengers
to the middle of nowhere.

08:45.394 --> 08:48.528
Okay, well, we could
workshop the dialogue a bit.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.138
Do you have a better idea?

08:51.661 --> 08:54.229
Excuse me,
I can take that in.

08:54.229 --> 08:55.491
No, it's all right.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.667
This, uh, flight crew can
get a bit crass.

08:57.667 --> 08:58.886
Not for the faint of heart.

08:58.886 --> 09:02.237
Well, I've gotta learn
sometime, right?

09:02.237 --> 09:03.543
Okay.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.245
Cream or sugar?

09:10.245 --> 09:12.203
Uh, cream, two sugars--

09:12.203 --> 09:14.771
oh, and your hotel room number
in New York.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.164
Forgive the captain.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.035
They don't have a manners class
at Annapolis.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.689
Relax, Kirk.
She thought it was funny.

09:19.689 --> 09:22.387
- Oh, yeah.
- Didn't you, doll?

09:22.387 --> 09:24.085
Sure.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.652
I hope you choke
on your coffee.

09:25.652 --> 09:28.437
Just sugar for me.

09:31.527 --> 09:34.138
The passengers might
be getting a bit nervous.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.836
Maybe we should
divert the flight.

09:35.836 --> 09:39.013
I was flying a B-17
at the Battle of the Bulge

09:39.013 --> 09:40.884
when you were curling
your dollies' hair.

09:40.884 --> 09:44.366
I can handle
a little rain shower.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.411
This guy's a real charmer.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.023
You know, that'll be it, sweetheart.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.285
And, uh...
- Jim--

09:50.285 --> 09:52.635
Send Holly next time.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.986
Wow.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.422
You have to keep pressing them.

09:57.422 --> 09:58.641
Yeah.

09:58.641 --> 10:01.688
This aircraft is
relatively new, right?

10:01.688 --> 10:04.081
Are we sure there aren't any
underlying mechanical issues?

10:04.081 --> 10:06.257
You think you know so much
about this plane, sunshine?

10:06.257 --> 10:11.436
What's the optimal speed
for the 747 at flaps 25?

10:11.436 --> 10:13.613
140 if the fuel's half
or under, 150 if over.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.267
140 at half tank,
otherwise 150.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.622
The copilot looks like
he might agree with you,

10:22.622 --> 10:27.496
but he's not gonna jump
Mr. Chain of Command over here.

10:27.496 --> 10:28.671
First Officer Kirk--

10:28.671 --> 10:30.673
Honey, you want
to fly this plane,

10:30.673 --> 10:31.805
go to flight school.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.242
Until then, stick
to cocktail waitressing.

10:39.334 --> 10:40.901
I'm starting to think
the early '70s wasn't

10:40.901 --> 10:42.250
the best time for stewardesses.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.861
Yeah. I am appreciating
your feminist awakening.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.126
Okay, we have 45 minutes
before the plane loses contact.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.171
What now?

10:50.171 --> 10:51.259
Okay,
HQ has done some digging.

10:51.259 --> 10:52.782
Apparently, that captain

10:52.782 --> 10:54.784
is under investigation
from the airline.

10:54.784 --> 10:55.959
- What for?
- Don't know.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.221
About to find out.
- Wait, wait, wait.

10:57.221 --> 10:59.571
What do I do?
- Oh, uh, I think it's time

10:59.571 --> 11:01.791
for that service with a smile.

11:07.362 --> 11:09.625
Whoa.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.279
You okay?

11:11.279 --> 11:13.890
Cory Zampol is driving me nuts.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.326
3B?
- Oh, right.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.024
The kid who thinks
the world revolves around him.

11:17.024 --> 11:19.679
Well, from his point of view,
it does.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.854
His dad owns the airline.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.116
Oh, that makes
a lot of sense.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.508
Yeah.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.641
Oh. Your turn.

11:25.641 --> 11:27.469
- Service with a smile.
- Yeah.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.300
So that's butterscotch,

11:32.300 --> 11:33.997
white and dark chocolate,
and ginger crumble.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.825
And the butter pecan ice cream
with the real pecans.

11:35.825 --> 11:36.913
I'll see
what I can scrounge up.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.219
It--it's back there.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.134
This line of the 747 has
the extra-large freezer.

11:40.134 --> 11:41.265
You're new.
I'll come with you.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.223
I know where to find it.
- That's okay.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.398
- I don't mind.
- It's okay.

11:43.398 --> 11:44.965
- It's okay, I don't--
- Cory, sit down.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.621
Hey,
if you poisoned his sundae,

11:49.621 --> 11:51.188
any jury would acquit you.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.241
- Excuse me.
- Mm?

12:00.241 --> 12:01.895
I forgot my lighter.
Do you have any matches?

12:01.895 --> 12:03.113
Uh, yeah.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.420
Uh, I saw it here somewhere.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.943
Ah.

12:06.943 --> 12:11.034
Um... I'm really sorry
about your seatmate.

12:11.034 --> 12:12.253
He's a real--
- Bug?

12:12.253 --> 12:13.950
Nuisance?
Endless pain in my rear?

12:13.950 --> 12:16.126
Well, I was gonna
say character.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.606
I can switch your seat
if you want.

12:17.606 --> 12:18.563
Oh, I'm okay.
At least I'm not

12:18.563 --> 12:19.782
sitting next to 2C.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.697
Oh, you mean Mr. Handsy?

12:23.177 --> 12:25.701
Well, you should really
consider quitting.

12:25.701 --> 12:26.876
I know, I know.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.573
I saw the big
Surgeon General's report.

12:28.573 --> 12:29.923
I try, but every time

12:29.923 --> 12:31.402
I'm around my boss,
I start again.

12:31.402 --> 12:32.490
Must be some boss.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.884
Yeah, he's a real character.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.714
Wait, you work
for Cory Zampol?

12:38.714 --> 12:40.237
Well, his dad, technically.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.718
I do private security
for the Zampols,

12:42.718 --> 12:44.241
which mostly means
escorting Cory

12:44.241 --> 12:45.852
on his extravagant
European vacations.

12:45.852 --> 12:46.853
- Hmm.
- Yes.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.811
Ben, she is ex-NYPD.

12:48.811 --> 12:49.899
She could help us.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.205
Let me guess, once you really

12:51.205 --> 12:53.076
get to know him,
he's actually a good kid?

12:53.076 --> 12:54.121
Mm, once you really
get to know him,

12:54.121 --> 12:55.296
he's an even bigger pain.

12:55.296 --> 12:57.559
But the gig pays well,

12:57.559 --> 13:00.605
and I wasn't exactly climbing
the ladder at my last job, so.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.651
Ask her if she's seen
anything suspicious.

13:04.914 --> 13:07.569
It was nice to meet you...

13:07.569 --> 13:09.092
- Leslie.
- Lois.

13:09.092 --> 13:12.269
Uh, please let me know
if you need anything else.

13:15.272 --> 13:16.796
Okay.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.275
Why didn't you ask
for her help?

13:18.275 --> 13:19.581
And tell her what,
that I'm a time traveler

13:19.581 --> 13:21.104
from the future
who needs to know who

13:21.104 --> 13:23.106
or what crashes this plane
in 30 minutes?

13:23.106 --> 13:25.979
Well, again, the wording
could use some help, but--

13:28.329 --> 13:31.898
Hey, is this still
about Martínez?

13:33.682 --> 13:35.379
Ah!

13:35.379 --> 13:38.469
Just keep digging
for more information.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.690
I'll be okay.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.482
All right, I want one team
searching foreign nationals

13:51.482 --> 13:53.310
and another combing
through US citizens.

13:53.310 --> 13:56.618
Look for any ties
to radical political groups

13:56.618 --> 13:58.489
and causes, organizations--

13:58.489 --> 13:59.664
Hey, any progress?

13:59.664 --> 14:01.666
I got something.

14:01.666 --> 14:02.667
I guess so.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.147
The captain, Jim Gentilly,

14:04.147 --> 14:05.409
turns out he'd been
acting erratic

14:05.409 --> 14:07.150
in the months leading up
to this flight,

14:07.150 --> 14:08.804
and he missed a lot of work.

14:08.804 --> 14:11.415
Digging a little deeper,
I found a bunch of mysterious

14:11.415 --> 14:13.330
financial transfers
to a shell corporation.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.289
- Gambling debt?
- I went down that road, too.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.378
But then I dug
into the shell company.

14:17.378 --> 14:19.336
It's an off-books
medical clinic.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.816
He was getting
electroshock therapy.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.905
He was suffering.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.907
Bipolar disorder, depression.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.169
But why the payments?

14:26.169 --> 14:27.867
Pilot unions had
good insurance.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.520
He wanted it off-book.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.914
At that time, the stigma
of a mental health disorder

14:31.914 --> 14:33.176
would end your career.

14:33.176 --> 14:34.438
As unfair as that may be,

14:34.438 --> 14:36.919
it jibes with a Reddit theory
that I found

14:36.919 --> 14:39.748
from user
Oswald-Was-An-Alien-117.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.924
- Credible source.
- Oh, you would be surprised

14:41.924 --> 14:43.621
at their accuracy
in other threads.

14:43.621 --> 14:48.017
Anyway, they--they think
that TGA 349 crashed

14:48.017 --> 14:49.714
from pilot suicide.

14:57.026 --> 14:58.680
Hey! Hey!

14:58.680 --> 15:01.204
Hey, he--he started having
chest pains and he collapsed.

15:01.204 --> 15:02.205
I think he's having
a heart attack.

15:02.205 --> 15:03.554
That's not a heart attack.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.034
That's poison.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.862
Ben, the flight engineer.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.083
He's gone.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.911
So is the captain.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.436
It wasn't pilot suicide.
It was double murder.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.838
What the hell just happened?

15:26.838 --> 15:28.492
The coffee.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.932
Did you drink this?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.411
No, I was waiting
for it to cool off.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.459
Wait.

15:38.459 --> 15:39.895
Wait, you-you're not--
- It was poisoned?

15:39.895 --> 15:41.679
Yeah, it's
the likeliest explanation.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.638
And Holly was awfully reluctant

15:43.638 --> 15:45.379
to hand that coffee tray over.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.296
Oh, no, no, no.
I know what you're thinking.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.688
It wasn't me.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.429
But--but I think I know
who might have done it.

15:52.429 --> 15:54.736
Are we okay
with just one pilot?

15:54.736 --> 15:56.085
Yeah, I've flown
a million miles.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.478
You're in good hands.
But we need to make

15:57.478 --> 15:58.566
an emergency landing.

15:58.566 --> 16:00.263
We're in a communications
dead zone.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.961
Once we're in range
of an airport,

16:01.961 --> 16:03.658
I can radio their tower.
- It's past 10:08.

16:03.658 --> 16:07.444
That's why the flight never
issued a distress signal.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.316
But we still don't know
why it went down.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.622
Because the threat is still
on the plane.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.019
Okay, no sign of Holly.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.455
Okay, I need to check
the downstairs cabin.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.370
No, Ben.
You can't do this by yourself.

16:20.370 --> 16:21.632
You need help.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.983
I have help.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.680
From someone
who's not a hologram.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.029
Don't s--

16:28.770 --> 16:30.946
Don't sell yourself short.

16:30.946 --> 16:33.470
Okay, this is not the time

16:33.470 --> 16:36.169
to start flying solo.

16:36.169 --> 16:38.954
Hey, I know
you must be exhausted.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.825
I mean,
putting yourself on the line

16:40.825 --> 16:42.610
leap after leap--

16:44.699 --> 16:47.093
You're almost home.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.138
Last mile of the marathon.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.706
You know how many people have
heart attacks in mile 26?

16:51.706 --> 16:53.490
No. How many?

16:53.490 --> 16:55.014
- I don't know, a lot.
- Okay, you know what?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.058
I thought flight attendants
were supposed

16:56.058 --> 16:57.755
to have sunny dispositions.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.322
I'm glad we're close.

16:59.322 --> 17:00.976
All the more reason
why I can't risk

17:00.976 --> 17:02.412
trusting the wrong person.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.979
I can't blow my chance
to get home to you.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.329
- Ben--
- I need to go find Holly.

17:13.684 --> 17:16.644
Okay, so what do we know
about this flight attendant?

17:16.644 --> 17:18.950
Any idea why she'd want
to kill the cockpit crew?

17:18.950 --> 17:20.430
Holly has a pretty
clean record.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.215
But her on-again,
off-again boyfriend...

17:22.215 --> 17:23.999
Not so much.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.306
Patrick Reilly--
this guy's dirty as dirt.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.264
Multiple arrests,
in and out of prison, and--

17:28.264 --> 17:30.745
wait for it--
ties to the IRA.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.616
Mm. That'll explain it.

17:32.616 --> 17:35.619
Taking over a 747 definitely
makes a statement.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.056
But why crash the plane?

17:37.056 --> 17:39.101
If she's IRA, why not demand
political concessions?

17:39.101 --> 17:40.537
Could be someone went rogue,

17:40.537 --> 17:42.539
or they lost control
of the plane.

17:42.539 --> 17:43.801
They?

17:43.801 --> 17:45.325
As in more than just Holly?

17:45.325 --> 17:48.197
Well, IRA hijackers, they--
they always work in teams.

17:48.197 --> 17:49.242
There's no way
that Holly would have

17:49.242 --> 17:50.373
taken the plane on her own.

17:50.373 --> 17:52.723
Keep digging
into that manifest.

17:52.723 --> 17:54.638
See who she might
be working with.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.081
Hi.
Sorry, could I trouble you

18:02.081 --> 18:03.169
for a set of the metal
airplane wings?

18:03.169 --> 18:04.909
Cory, I have a job to do.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.433
People rely on me
to keep them safe.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.695
And this may come
as a shock to you,

18:07.695 --> 18:09.914
but the world does not
revolve around you.

18:28.716 --> 18:29.717
Oh.

18:29.717 --> 18:32.154
- Oh.
- Whoa.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.722
Oh, so sorry.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.158
Quaaludes, bourbon--

18:36.158 --> 18:38.465
that's really not
a great combination.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.120
Cheers.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.472
Ah.

18:46.690 --> 18:49.215
Oh, my God.
Jim <i>and</i> Carl?

18:49.215 --> 18:51.173
They're--they're both dead?

18:51.173 --> 18:52.435
Wait, is the plane safe?

18:52.435 --> 18:53.741
I mean, should we warn
the passengers?

18:53.741 --> 18:54.959
We're going to be fine.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.700
Thank God
the copilot didn't drink

18:56.700 --> 18:58.702
that poisoned coffee.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.313
Wait, are you--

19:00.313 --> 19:02.271
you're--you're not
accusing me, are you?

19:02.271 --> 19:03.403
You brewed that pot,
didn't you?

19:03.403 --> 19:05.405
And you brought it
into the cockpit.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.102
How do I know you didn't do it?

19:07.102 --> 19:08.321
I can't believe you, Lois.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.714
I got you this route,

19:10.714 --> 19:13.021
and this is how you repay me?

19:13.021 --> 19:15.458
This is what I get
for trusting a friend?

19:18.722 --> 19:20.159
Do you believe her?

19:20.159 --> 19:23.597
If she did do it,
she's a really good actor.

19:23.597 --> 19:25.164
That's the crew's
luggage compartment.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.514
You should check her bag.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.217
Anything from the manifest?

19:35.217 --> 19:36.610
Couple of serial tax cheats,

19:36.610 --> 19:38.655
but no one with ties
to the IRA.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.004
What about the rest
of the flight crew?

19:40.004 --> 19:41.223
Mm, nothing yet.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.964
What about those
employee background checks?

19:42.964 --> 19:44.357
FAA says they're
on their way.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.141
They weren't big
on record keeping back then.

19:46.141 --> 19:47.795
Some of these entries
on the passenger manifest

19:47.795 --> 19:49.318
don't even have first names.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.538
Yeah, their--their screening
process was a total joke,

19:51.538 --> 19:53.104
which is why we need--
- Ziggy.

19:53.104 --> 19:55.194
You mentioned that
once or twice.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.371
Okay, all right, fine.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.634
So--so I took the shutdown
a little personally.

20:00.634 --> 20:01.896
But do you blame me?

20:01.896 --> 20:05.160
Look, I--I oversaw
every single line of code

20:05.160 --> 20:08.032
that went into putting
Ziggy back online.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.033
It's part of me.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.601
It's not. It's code.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.342
It's not you.
- Okay, well, that's like

20:13.342 --> 20:16.215
telling a songwriter,
your lyrics aren't you.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.390
That doesn't
make it hurt any less

20:17.390 --> 20:18.913
when the audience screams
"you suck"

20:18.913 --> 20:19.957
at your 11th grade talent show.

20:19.957 --> 20:21.263
Okay, let's save that story

20:21.263 --> 20:22.656
for another session.

20:22.656 --> 20:25.006
I get it.
It's hard not to feel attacked.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.268
Any time there's
a security breach,

20:26.268 --> 20:27.530
I take it hard.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.706
Look, it's--it's not just--

20:29.706 --> 20:33.275
it's not just about Ziggy,
all right?

20:33.275 --> 20:35.582
It--it's about
me finding out that--

20:35.582 --> 20:38.062
that future me travels
through time

20:38.062 --> 20:39.586
to set this whole thing
in motion,

20:39.586 --> 20:41.762
and then keeps the entire
thing secret from all of you.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.894
That's--I don't know.

20:43.894 --> 20:47.376
I'm just--I'm just a little
at sea at the moment.

20:47.376 --> 20:48.638
That's--that's all.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.161
From where I stand,

20:50.161 --> 20:51.337
you got this on lock.

20:51.337 --> 20:52.947
An AI, we can do without.

20:52.947 --> 20:55.732
But without you,

20:55.732 --> 20:57.299
we'd truly be lost.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.047
Passport, clothes,

21:06.047 --> 21:07.353
nothing that suspicious.

21:07.353 --> 21:08.658
Maybe Holly's innocent.

21:08.658 --> 21:09.877
Well, let me scan
her passport

21:09.877 --> 21:11.618
and run her travel pattern
just to be sure.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.796
Why are you going
through Holly's stuff?

21:15.796 --> 21:17.798
This area is crew only.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.582
You should not be back here.

21:19.582 --> 21:21.236
Holly always lets me
back here.

21:21.236 --> 21:22.933
It's where they keep
the airplane wings.

21:22.933 --> 21:25.414
Okay, well,
he's not going away that easy.

21:25.414 --> 21:27.851
Aren't you a little too old
for novelty wings?

21:27.851 --> 21:29.157
I have a collection.

21:29.157 --> 21:30.593
Every edition since the start
of this airline.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.029
Can't you just ask
your dad for them?

21:32.029 --> 21:33.509
I did.

21:34.989 --> 21:38.166
But it's more fun to collect
them on flights anyway.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.258
So where are you coming from,
vacation with your parents?

21:43.258 --> 21:44.520
They were busy working.

21:44.520 --> 21:45.826
It was--it was just me
and Officer Leslie.

21:45.826 --> 21:48.219
You were vacationing
with your babysitter?

21:48.219 --> 21:51.135
Officer Leslie's
not a babysitter.

21:51.135 --> 21:52.615
She's, like, my best friend.

21:52.615 --> 21:54.791
Don't you want to hang out
with kids your own age?

21:54.791 --> 21:56.793
No, not really.

22:00.493 --> 22:03.278
Lois, is there an emergency
on the plane?

22:03.278 --> 22:05.585
Why would you think there's
an emergency on the plane?

22:05.585 --> 22:07.456
Because that's where they
keep the emergency equipment,

22:07.456 --> 22:09.371
and the tamper seal is broken.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.471
That's a go bag.

22:22.471 --> 22:24.647
You mean the kind they'd use
after you hijack a plane?

22:24.647 --> 22:27.476
- Yeah.
- The plane is being hijacked?

22:27.476 --> 22:29.783
And I bet that was cyanide
in their coffee.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.093
- It's the copilot.
- He must have poisoned

22:36.093 --> 22:37.356
the rest of the flight crew.

22:38.879 --> 22:39.880
Okay.

22:41.316 --> 22:44.537
Officer Leslie,
the plane is being hijacked.

22:46.974 --> 22:49.368
Well, looks like
you ruined the surprise.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.717
Hands in the air.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.197
Uh, okay.

22:53.197 --> 22:56.244
You might have been right
not to trust her.

23:05.296 --> 23:07.386
Ladies and gentlemen,

23:07.386 --> 23:10.040
<i>I regret to inform you
that this plane won't</i>

23:10.040 --> 23:12.129
<i>be landing
in New York tonight.</i>

23:12.129 --> 23:14.523
<i>We're gonna make
a little detour.</i>

23:14.523 --> 23:16.830
<i>As long
as Transglobal Airlines meets</i>

23:16.830 --> 23:19.136
<i>our ransom demand,
you'll all be free</i>

23:19.136 --> 23:22.139
<i>to return to your families.</i>

23:22.139 --> 23:23.576
<i>We don't want to hurt anyone.</i>

23:23.576 --> 23:25.752
If you all remain calm,
we'll land safely,

23:25.752 --> 23:27.362
and everyone will be home soon.

23:27.362 --> 23:28.972
What if the cops surround us
when we land?

23:28.972 --> 23:30.234
In Havana?

23:30.234 --> 23:32.193
Not a chance.
I worked out every detail.

23:32.193 --> 23:34.456
Before you know it,
we'll be on Playa Paraíso,

23:34.456 --> 23:37.154
sipping mojitos
and counting our ransom money.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.291
Cory's father has made millions
running this airline,

23:43.291 --> 23:45.685
exploiting working people
like us.

23:45.685 --> 23:48.383
It's time for us
to bring him to his knees.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.169
Wow.

23:52.169 --> 23:54.084
Our two lovebirds have
two gunmen with them,

23:54.084 --> 23:55.303
for a total of four.

23:55.303 --> 23:57.174
Now, according
to their profiles,

23:57.174 --> 23:59.176
these two gunmen must
be mercenaries--

23:59.176 --> 24:00.787
hired guns, so to speak.

24:00.787 --> 24:01.831
What about Bonnie and Clyde?

24:01.831 --> 24:03.137
Well, uh, Kirk,

24:03.137 --> 24:04.660
he was strapped
pretty hard for cash.

24:04.660 --> 24:07.358
He got passed over
for a promotion to pilot,

24:07.358 --> 24:09.012
and then he fell
deep into debt.

24:09.012 --> 24:10.318
Our ex-cop is the ringleader.

24:10.318 --> 24:11.493
She's had money problems, too.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.408
This can't just be
about a payday.

24:13.408 --> 24:15.671
I mean, there are easier ways
to get out of debt.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.412
It's about power.

24:17.412 --> 24:20.676
Most hijackers are feeling
disenfranchised, disrespected.

24:20.676 --> 24:23.113
There's no quicker way
to take back power

24:23.113 --> 24:24.985
than grabbing control
of an airplane.

24:24.985 --> 24:26.726
And as a woman in the NYPD,

24:26.726 --> 24:29.206
she faced her share
of disrespect.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.773
And then working
for that family?

24:30.773 --> 24:32.209
My guess is it was even worse.

24:32.209 --> 24:33.863
How she talked
about that CEO,

24:33.863 --> 24:35.865
like, this beef is personal.

24:35.865 --> 24:37.519
I mean, they could have
hijacked any plane.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.216
They picked the one
with his kid on it.

24:39.216 --> 24:40.217
You know,
it still doesn't explain

24:40.217 --> 24:41.218
why they crashed the plane.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.655
Why not call for ransom?

24:42.655 --> 24:44.744
Yeah, that's the part that's
still a mystery to me.

24:44.744 --> 24:47.398
Let's focus
on what we can control.

24:47.398 --> 24:50.010
How's Ben supposed
to stop these hijackers?

24:50.010 --> 24:53.753
Okay, so if Ben is gonna
take control of this airplane,

24:53.753 --> 24:55.711
then he's gonna need
to disarm the men

24:55.711 --> 24:58.322
that are patrolling the cabin
here and here.

24:58.322 --> 25:00.107
Those guys are
200 pounds each.

25:00.107 --> 25:02.239
Ben's leap host is
half their size.

25:02.239 --> 25:04.372
Yeah, I'm more concerned
with those AK-47s.

25:04.372 --> 25:05.808
If he can take them out,

25:05.808 --> 25:07.506
he still has to make it
to the cockpit

25:07.506 --> 25:09.420
and face two more
video game bosses.

25:09.420 --> 25:11.466
Yeah, and if he's able
to pull off that minor miracle,

25:11.466 --> 25:14.904
he still needs
to land a 150-ton plane

25:14.904 --> 25:16.253
in the dead of the night.

25:16.253 --> 25:18.778
Something that takes
a decade of training.

25:18.778 --> 25:20.562
Gee, is that all?

25:20.562 --> 25:21.824
Won't he have a better chance

25:21.824 --> 25:23.434
once they're on the ground
in Havana?

25:23.434 --> 25:25.001
Uh, according
to the Internet,

25:25.001 --> 25:26.437
this plane still crashes.

25:26.437 --> 25:28.265
So Ben's gonna
have to act fast,

25:28.265 --> 25:30.093
or else none
of these passengers

25:30.093 --> 25:31.617
are gonna make it home.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.144
- Can we just--
- No talking!

25:40.756 --> 25:42.715
We need to make a plan.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.368
He said no talking.

25:46.153 --> 25:48.068
I'm sorry I accused you.

25:48.068 --> 25:51.462
We have to band together
if we're gonna stop these guys.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.290
No one's getting hurt.

25:53.290 --> 25:54.640
They just want money.

25:56.990 --> 25:57.904
Follow my lead.

26:05.346 --> 26:06.608
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh!

26:06.608 --> 26:08.915
I told you
to stay in the back!

26:08.915 --> 26:11.918
These people need water.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.049
Panicked people get dehydrated,

26:13.049 --> 26:14.311
dehydrated people get sick,

26:14.311 --> 26:16.836
and sick people make
for a messy hijacking.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.840
Fine.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.189
Make it quick.

26:39.075 --> 26:40.163
This your granddaughter?

26:40.163 --> 26:41.295
Caroline Rose.

26:41.295 --> 26:42.905
I'm on my way to see her.

26:42.905 --> 26:44.167
She like planes?

26:44.167 --> 26:45.473
She loves planes.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.649
When all this is over,
I'll make sure

26:47.649 --> 26:49.346
she gets some airplane wings
as a souvenir.

26:49.346 --> 26:51.087
Thank you.

26:51.087 --> 26:53.133
This woman's about
to go into diabetic shock.

26:53.133 --> 26:55.526
She needs her insulin.
- Fine.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.616
I just had my insulin.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.285
Even hijackers need
to hydrate.

27:15.285 --> 27:16.722
I'm not drinking that.

27:18.724 --> 27:19.507
Suit yourself.

27:19.507 --> 27:20.639
You drink it.

27:22.118 --> 27:23.206
That's okay.
I've had

27:23.206 --> 27:24.947
enough water for today.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.427
I wasn't asking.

27:28.385 --> 27:29.735
Okay.

27:38.961 --> 27:40.006
Refreshing.

27:52.496 --> 27:54.673
Is that enough insulin
to keep him down?

27:54.673 --> 27:57.719
It is when you mix in enough
quaaludes to sedate a horse.

27:59.286 --> 28:00.983
Watch him.

28:00.983 --> 28:02.071
I'm going to first.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.170
Okay, no cause for concern.

28:14.170 --> 28:16.433
I'm just here to see
if anybody needs anything.

28:16.433 --> 28:17.913
Back to coach, lady.

28:20.437 --> 28:22.439
I'm sorry,
this kid's hyperventilating.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.401
Do you want to clean up
when he vomits, or...

28:27.401 --> 28:28.750
Fine, go ahead.

28:32.058 --> 28:33.929
Hey. You okay?

28:33.929 --> 28:35.322
You're okay.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.152
It's all because of me,
isn't it?

28:39.152 --> 28:41.415
Leslie hijacked the plane
to ransom me to my dad?

28:43.243 --> 28:44.940
Let's look on the bright side.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.028
I was wrong.

28:46.028 --> 28:49.466
The world does revolve
around you.

28:49.466 --> 28:52.252
I can't believe
I thought she was my friend.

28:52.252 --> 28:54.428
I was so stupid.

28:54.428 --> 28:56.647
None of these people
care about me.

28:56.647 --> 28:58.432
My parents pay to ship me off.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.173
Even the people who are paid
to care about me

29:00.173 --> 29:02.741
don't care about me.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.655
Guess you really can't
trust anyone.

29:06.788 --> 29:09.138
People let you down, kid.

29:09.138 --> 29:11.793
That's life.

29:11.793 --> 29:15.014
You're not very good
at pep talks.

29:15.014 --> 29:18.147
Sorry, I'm usually
better at this.

29:18.147 --> 29:19.801
It's been a rough week.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.585
So what now?

29:21.585 --> 29:23.500
I'm working on it.

29:27.678 --> 29:28.679
What are you doing?

29:28.679 --> 29:30.986
You, sit down! Now!

29:30.986 --> 29:32.161
I said sit down!

29:42.476 --> 29:43.346
Okay, tell him
to keep pressure on that.

29:43.346 --> 29:44.783
Keep pressure on that.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.654
We have to do something!

29:46.654 --> 29:47.742
Let's take the cockpit!

29:47.742 --> 29:49.222
Ben, you need
to calm them down.

29:49.222 --> 29:50.397
If they try
and take the cockpit,

29:50.397 --> 29:52.921
they can send this plane
into the ocean.

29:52.921 --> 29:54.705
Everyone.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.011
Everyone!

29:56.011 --> 29:57.360
Okay, I know you're all scared,

29:57.360 --> 29:59.145
but I need you to stay calm.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.102
I have a plan.

30:00.102 --> 30:01.190
You do?

30:01.190 --> 30:02.539
Kind of.

30:02.539 --> 30:05.020
Okay, it says,
crease the aluminum foil,

30:05.020 --> 30:07.762
and then add three parts
sodium nitrate.

30:07.762 --> 30:10.547
Okay, let me just look in
the volatile chemicals cabinet.

30:10.547 --> 30:11.722
Helpful.

30:11.722 --> 30:13.507
Okay, it says
sodium nitrate is found

30:13.507 --> 30:15.335
in gunpowder, uh, limestone,

30:15.335 --> 30:17.206
and--and some
chemical cold packs.

30:17.206 --> 30:18.294
That I can find.

30:20.296 --> 30:21.297
Yes.

30:24.213 --> 30:26.128
Don't say it. Don't say it.

30:26.128 --> 30:27.738
I didn't say anything.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.479
I'm definitely not gonna say
that this would be

30:29.479 --> 30:32.047
a lot easier with a second pair
of non-holographic hands.

30:32.047 --> 30:33.396
Your restraint is admirable.

30:33.396 --> 30:34.833
- Mm-hmm.
- What's the next step?

30:34.833 --> 30:36.443
Two parts sugar.

30:38.358 --> 30:40.055
I'm also definitely not going
to mention the fact

30:40.055 --> 30:41.578
that if we get
into the cockpit,

30:41.578 --> 30:44.277
this is clearly
a two-person job.

30:44.277 --> 30:45.887
Ben.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.497
Look, I know you don't think

30:47.497 --> 30:49.891
that you can trust anyone anymore,

30:49.891 --> 30:51.762
but that's not you.

30:51.762 --> 30:52.894
That's never been you.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.809
Maybe that's the problem.

30:56.158 --> 30:59.466
You needed Martínez
to complete the last leap.

30:59.466 --> 31:02.338
I mean, even with everything
that happened,

31:02.338 --> 31:04.253
you made the right call.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.255
And then a-again today,
with Leslie.

31:06.255 --> 31:08.779
You trusted your gut,
and you were right again.

31:08.779 --> 31:12.174
Look, your instincts
are spot-on.

31:12.174 --> 31:14.046
And I know they are
telling you right now

31:14.046 --> 31:16.439
that you cannot do this alone.

31:16.439 --> 31:21.140
You need to trust someone
and ask for help.

31:25.666 --> 31:27.102
What the hell is going on
out there?

31:27.102 --> 31:28.408
It sounded like gunfire.

31:28.408 --> 31:30.671
Why haven't they checked in?

31:33.326 --> 31:35.284
Hey, tell me
that cabin is secure.

31:35.284 --> 31:36.764
<i>You don't want to do this.</i>

31:36.764 --> 31:39.636
Kirk, you spent years
in the Navy,

31:39.636 --> 31:42.726
<i>served in two wars,
multiple commendations.</i>

31:42.726 --> 31:46.426
<i>Leslie, you're a career cop,
just like your dad.</i>

31:46.426 --> 31:48.776
You took an oath
to serve and protect.

31:48.776 --> 31:50.299
You're both patriots.

31:50.299 --> 31:52.998
<i>You do not want to take
your own countrymen hostage</i>

31:52.998 --> 31:54.564
<i>and live the rest
of your life on the run.</i>

31:54.564 --> 31:55.914
This has nothing
to do with you.

31:55.914 --> 31:56.958
Stay out of it!

31:56.958 --> 31:57.959
Now.

32:03.399 --> 32:05.358
What is that?

32:07.577 --> 32:08.796
We gotta get out of here.

32:08.796 --> 32:10.102
No, we have
to see this through.

32:13.105 --> 32:14.236
It's locked!

32:14.236 --> 32:16.499
Hey! Open it up!

32:16.499 --> 32:17.979
We're not killing them, right?

32:17.979 --> 32:19.198
Just putting them to sleep.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.382
Leslie and Kirk are tied up
in the galley.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.862
Hey, we are only 220 miles away
from Puerto Rico.

32:31.862 --> 32:34.169
We just have to figure out
how to land this thing.

32:34.169 --> 32:35.954
Cory, you can land us, right?

32:35.954 --> 32:37.085
Are you kidding?

32:37.085 --> 32:38.304
Didn't you say
you took flying lessons?

32:38.304 --> 32:40.219
In a Cessna!
And haven't we established

32:40.219 --> 32:42.395
those people were paid to tell
me I knew what I was doing?

32:42.395 --> 32:44.136
I'll see if Ian can
run a simulator.

32:44.136 --> 32:46.225
And no amount of flying
lessons would have saved us.

32:46.225 --> 32:48.923
Even the copilot couldn't
have landed this.

32:48.923 --> 32:50.185
What do you mean?

32:50.185 --> 32:51.534
See that warning system?

32:52.883 --> 32:55.147
We're losing hydraulics.

32:55.147 --> 32:56.409
What does that mean?

32:56.409 --> 32:59.586
No hydraulics means
no control.

32:59.586 --> 33:02.371
We've got five minutes
before this plane crashes.

33:07.289 --> 33:08.638
The gunshots must have
gone straight

33:08.638 --> 33:09.726
into the instrument controls

33:09.726 --> 33:10.858
and ruptured
the hydraulics line.

33:10.858 --> 33:12.033
That must be
what crashed the plane

33:12.033 --> 33:13.208
in the original timeline.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.557
How fast are
they losing altitude?

33:14.557 --> 33:15.950
Fast.
And even if they could somehow

33:15.950 --> 33:18.039
stabilize, they can't steer
without hydraulics.

33:18.039 --> 33:19.823
- So what can they do?
- I can either explain,

33:19.823 --> 33:21.825
or I can find answers.
I can't do both.

33:23.349 --> 33:25.481
We're at 8,700 feet
and dropping.

33:25.481 --> 33:26.874
Okay, I just heard from Ian.

33:26.874 --> 33:29.311
They think that you can
manually reroute

33:29.311 --> 33:30.704
the hydraulics
from the avionics bay.

33:30.704 --> 33:31.705
Where's the avionics bay?

33:31.705 --> 33:33.533
On this line of the 747,

33:33.533 --> 33:35.448
under the fuselage.
Why do you a--

33:35.448 --> 33:36.927
a manual reroute.

33:36.927 --> 33:37.885
That's brilliant.

33:37.885 --> 33:39.713
both: But that's a two-man job.

33:39.713 --> 33:41.497
One person has to stay
in the cockpit

33:41.497 --> 33:43.934
to take control of the plane
once the line's patched.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.240
Cory, do you think
you know your way around

33:45.240 --> 33:46.807
the avionics bay?

33:48.330 --> 33:50.898
All right.
You go, I'll stay.

33:52.639 --> 33:56.643
Uh, time's kind of--
of the essence here, Cory.

33:56.643 --> 33:58.123
So, um--

33:58.123 --> 34:01.256
If I don't get this right,
and this plane crashes,

34:01.256 --> 34:02.692
it'll all be my fault.

34:02.692 --> 34:05.869
Cory, you can do this.

34:05.869 --> 34:08.481
What if I can't?

34:08.481 --> 34:10.483
Look, I was wrong.

34:10.483 --> 34:12.093
When I said
people let you down,

34:12.093 --> 34:13.660
they do, sometimes.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.096
But then at some point,
you have to get back

34:15.096 --> 34:17.446
off the mat and learn
to trust other people again,

34:17.446 --> 34:19.883
learn to trust yourself.

34:19.883 --> 34:23.104
I bet your whole life,
they did everything for you--

34:23.104 --> 34:24.758
your parents, your minders.

34:24.758 --> 34:27.413
But I can see that you're ready
to stand on your own two feet.

34:27.413 --> 34:30.372
If you trust yourself,
you can do anything.

34:30.372 --> 34:31.634
Including helping
save the lives

34:31.634 --> 34:33.071
of everyone on this plane.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.075
Okay.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.902
That's a good pep talk.

34:44.691 --> 34:47.128
Okay.
I will monitor him in the bay.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.087
How am I gonna
land this thing?

34:49.087 --> 34:51.785
Uh, Ben, this is...

34:54.353 --> 34:55.571
Ian.

34:55.571 --> 34:57.747
You--you remember me?

34:57.747 --> 35:03.144
Is our, uh, karaoke duet song
"Under Pressure"?

35:03.144 --> 35:04.493
Tell Jenn she owes me
five bucks.

35:04.493 --> 35:05.538
I will ping you as soon

35:05.538 --> 35:07.017
as the hydraulics
are back online.

35:08.802 --> 35:10.369
That's a great look for you.

35:20.248 --> 35:21.945
Okay, so we're
below 4,000 feet,

35:21.945 --> 35:24.252
so, um, move those flaps to 20.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.561
Addison said that Cory is
in the avionics bay.

35:28.561 --> 35:30.215
It should only take two minutes
to patch the line.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.303
I thought we couldn't
keep two people

35:31.303 --> 35:32.478
in the Imaging Chamber
for long.

35:32.478 --> 35:33.566
Well, we couldn't.

35:33.566 --> 35:34.784
But then I ran a patch

35:34.784 --> 35:35.785
to help stabilize
two simultaneous--

35:35.785 --> 35:36.830
Actually, can we just put

35:36.830 --> 35:37.831
a pin in that for now?

35:37.831 --> 35:39.049
How do I fly an airplane?

35:39.049 --> 35:40.181
Right, right, right. Priorities.

35:40.181 --> 35:43.315
Okay, so, um,
pull those levers back.

35:43.315 --> 35:45.491
Slowly, slowly.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

35:45.491 --> 35:47.014
- Right there.
- Okay.

35:47.014 --> 35:48.276
You know, I'm still
not completely over

35:48.276 --> 35:49.756
you getting into
the accelerator without--

35:49.756 --> 35:51.192
Right now is not
the optimal time

35:51.192 --> 35:52.715
to criticize my life choices.

35:52.715 --> 35:53.847
Okay,
but if this plane crashes,

35:53.847 --> 35:54.761
this might be my only chance.

35:54.761 --> 35:55.892
Not funny.

35:55.892 --> 35:57.503
It's a little bit funny.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.331
Just a little bit.
- Besides, Addison told me

35:59.331 --> 36:00.897
it was your future self
who told me

36:00.897 --> 36:01.985
to get in the accelerator, right?

36:01.985 --> 36:03.291
Okay. All right. Sure.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.379
Sure. It was.

36:04.379 --> 36:06.381
But let's not
point fingers, okay?

36:06.381 --> 36:08.209
Look, you--I know you've
been out there, like,

36:08.209 --> 36:10.124
saving the world
and everything,

36:10.124 --> 36:12.126
but you really screwed
our trivia team.

36:12.126 --> 36:14.476
We used to dominate

36:14.476 --> 36:15.782
the federal employee league.

36:15.782 --> 36:18.045
Dominate!
We all had a part.

36:18.045 --> 36:19.568
Addison, she was pop culture.

36:19.568 --> 36:21.135
I had music, obviously.

36:21.135 --> 36:23.137
You were sports.
- Doesn't Jenn know sports?

36:23.137 --> 36:24.965
Jenn thought
that the Indianapolis Colts

36:24.965 --> 36:26.488
was a horse racing club.

36:26.488 --> 36:27.707
Inaccurate.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.274
Now you know why
the Department of Energy

36:29.274 --> 36:31.232
is the current reigning champ.

36:31.232 --> 36:33.191
Uh, turn those
landing lights on.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.281
You know, there's, um--

36:36.281 --> 36:38.283
there's a Zulu word, "ubuntu."

36:38.283 --> 36:42.025
It means "I am because we are."

36:42.025 --> 36:44.289
We can't do this
without each other.

36:44.289 --> 36:47.640
So please,

36:47.640 --> 36:48.815
come home soon.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.472
Addison said
that Cory patched the line.

36:53.472 --> 36:56.779
TGA 349, this is SJU tower.

36:56.779 --> 36:58.128
<i>Do you copy?</i>
- Uh, yes.

36:58.128 --> 37:00.609
This is TGA 349er.

37:00.609 --> 37:02.742
Uh, we have
a mechanical issue on board,

37:02.742 --> 37:04.918
and we need
to land immediately.

37:04.918 --> 37:06.528
<i>Copy that.
Fly heading 2-3-0,</i>

37:06.528 --> 37:08.922
<i>runway 2-7 left,
cleared for landing.</i>

37:08.922 --> 37:10.489
What does that--
what does that mean?

37:10.489 --> 37:12.099
Oh, this might help.

37:16.146 --> 37:18.540
Ian, you're a genius.

37:18.540 --> 37:19.802
I know.

37:23.197 --> 37:26.418
Okay, you're at 600 feet.

37:26.418 --> 37:27.723
Now 500 feet.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.682
Watch the crosswinds!
You're--

37:31.466 --> 37:33.163
The rudder!
Use your feet, Ben.

37:33.163 --> 37:34.861
Use your feet.
- I'm trying!

37:34.861 --> 37:36.297
Okay, now aim for as close

37:36.297 --> 37:38.691
to the edge of the runway
as you possibly can.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.214
Watch your speed.

37:40.214 --> 37:42.303
Power to idle, now!

37:45.088 --> 37:46.307
Pull back--gently.

37:46.307 --> 37:48.091
Gently.

38:05.761 --> 38:06.980
Brake! Use your brake!

38:06.980 --> 38:08.068
Aah!

38:30.395 --> 38:32.179
That wasn't that hard.

38:32.179 --> 38:34.921
Easy.

38:52.155 --> 38:53.374
- Aye.
- Whoo!

38:53.374 --> 38:55.289
Ow!

38:55.289 --> 38:57.944
Wow, being a hologram is
way harder than I thought.

38:57.944 --> 39:00.381
Yeah, it takes
some getting used to.

39:00.381 --> 39:01.687
Some?
I was dizzy for,

39:01.687 --> 39:02.818
like, a full day after.

39:02.818 --> 39:04.516
Cory Zampol ended up
being one

39:04.516 --> 39:07.606
of the longest-tenured pilots
in the TGA fleet history.

39:07.606 --> 39:10.391
Recently retired and started
teaching at flight school.

39:10.391 --> 39:13.612
And all four hijackers are
still comfortably behind bars.

39:13.612 --> 39:14.700
Yes.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.092
What about
our flight attendants?

39:16.092 --> 39:18.312
The entire crew received commendations,

39:18.312 --> 39:20.967
and Lois was invited
to the White House.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.142
- Mm.
- This is yours.

39:22.142 --> 39:23.186
- Thank you.
- I'm guessing she was

39:23.186 --> 39:25.014
very confused.

39:28.235 --> 39:29.497
What is it?

39:31.847 --> 39:33.283
No, it's just--

39:33.283 --> 39:37.331
we always get these wrap-ups
at the end of every leap,

39:37.331 --> 39:39.986
find out
where everybody ends up...

39:39.986 --> 39:41.857
except for Ben.

39:44.817 --> 39:49.169
Ian, you still think
Ben is nearing his last leap?

39:49.169 --> 39:51.824
Uh, if I had to guess,
he has one left--

39:51.824 --> 39:53.303
two max.

39:59.179 --> 40:00.354
What is it?

40:00.354 --> 40:02.748
Um, well,
usually after a leap,

40:02.748 --> 40:04.576
I can pick up
some kind of signature.

40:04.576 --> 40:06.534
I--I may not be able
to pinpoint exactly

40:06.534 --> 40:10.843
where Ben is, but I can get
a rough sense of when.

40:10.843 --> 40:12.671
But now I, uh--

40:12.671 --> 40:13.846
I'm--I'm getting nothing.

40:13.846 --> 40:14.934
Because Ziggy's down?

40:14.934 --> 40:16.283
No, it's something else.

40:16.283 --> 40:17.719
But I don't know what.

40:23.421 --> 40:26.119
Where are you, Ben?

40:56.758 --> 40:58.891
It's snowing...

40:58.891 --> 41:01.284
in LA.

41:01.284 --> 41:03.025
Nuclear winter.

41:05.506 --> 41:06.681
Ian?

41:06.681 --> 41:08.857
Hi, Ben.

41:08.857 --> 41:11.730
I've been waiting for you...

41:11.730 --> 41:13.645
for a long time.

41:13.645 --> 41:16.256
Oh, my God.

41:16.256 --> 41:18.214
I'm in the future.
