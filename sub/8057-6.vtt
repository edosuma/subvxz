WEBVTT

00:00.735 --> 00:01.934
It's so beautiful

00:01.935 --> 00:02.936
- and sparkly.
- I know.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.734
And it's a nonconflict diamond.

00:05.735 --> 00:07.936
When Andy proposed to me,
he gave me a ring pop,

00:07.987 --> 00:10.239
but then he ate it first.
How did Ben do it?

00:10.273 --> 00:11.723
Let me start
from the beginning.

00:11.741 --> 00:13.558
- Uh-oh.
- In 1832,

00:13.576 --> 00:17.395
Ben's great-great-great-great-
grandfather, Teodore Wyatt,

00:17.413 --> 00:20.082
a bastard, met a beautiful
seamstress from Antwerp.

00:20.116 --> 00:21.450
Ben and I are getting married,
and I've been telling

00:21.501 --> 00:22.835
everybody about it.

00:22.869 --> 00:24.419
I'm so happy, I want
to shout it from the rooftops.

00:24.454 --> 00:25.621
And she has.

00:25.672 --> 00:27.706
We've gotten
several noise complaints.

00:27.724 --> 00:30.375
- We're getting married!
- All right.

00:30.393 --> 00:33.762
Mm, the joy
that I am feeling

00:33.813 --> 00:37.933
right now is profound
and unmatched in the modern era.

00:37.984 --> 00:40.068
And I can't tell you
what it means to me

00:40.103 --> 00:42.387
that I'm the very first person
that you chose to tell.

00:42.405 --> 00:43.522
Oh--

00:43.556 --> 00:46.575
Let me walk around
with you

00:46.609 --> 00:47.893
as you tell everyone else

00:47.911 --> 00:52.915
so that I can share true joy
being spread, please?

00:52.949 --> 00:54.333
Hey, everyone!

00:54.367 --> 00:56.368
We have something
very exciting to tell you

00:56.402 --> 00:58.086
that you have
never heard before.

00:58.121 --> 00:59.371
- Ben and I are engaged...
- What?

00:59.405 --> 01:00.539
And you're hearing about it

01:00.573 --> 01:02.207
for the very first time
right now.

01:03.576 --> 01:05.844
Come on, everybody!
How about a little excitement?

01:05.879 --> 01:06.912
Leslie and Ben
are engaged!

01:06.930 --> 01:08.463
Nothing will ever come
between them!

01:08.464 --> 01:10.048
Leslie and Ben are--

01:10.082 --> 01:11.767
What's going on?

01:11.801 --> 01:12.768
Leslie and Ben are engaged!

01:13.802 --> 01:15.888
Again?

01:15.922 --> 01:17.022
- You guys!
- Oh.

01:17.056 --> 01:18.106
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah!

01:18.141 --> 01:19.925
Aah!

01:40.129 --> 01:42.664
- Okay, T-minus six hours
until the engagement party.

01:42.715 --> 01:45.133
Has you-know-who
responded yet?

01:45.168 --> 01:48.003
Surprisingly, no,
Larry Bird has not RSVP'd yet.

01:48.054 --> 01:49.388
Well, he kind of waits
until the last minute.

01:49.422 --> 01:50.956
That's his style.
Put him down as a "maybe."

01:50.974 --> 01:52.391
- Are you excited?
- Yeah, totally.

01:52.425 --> 01:54.259
I-I just have
two small requests.

01:54.293 --> 01:56.628
One, put Twizzlers
on the candy table,

01:56.646 --> 01:59.731
and two,
cancel the party

01:59.766 --> 02:00.983
because you invited
my parents,

02:01.017 --> 02:03.318
and they can't be
in the same room together.

02:03.353 --> 02:04.803
Okay?
Great, thank you.

02:04.821 --> 02:07.439
No to canceling the party,
and no to Twizzlers.

02:07.473 --> 02:09.241
We are a Red Vines family.

02:09.275 --> 02:10.324
You're gonna have
to get used to that.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.494
I know you're scared,
but I love you,

02:12.528 --> 02:14.496
and this party
is gonna go great.

02:14.530 --> 02:15.981
Well, if there's anyone

02:15.999 --> 02:18.650
who can bring my parents
together,

02:18.668 --> 02:20.118
it's no one.

02:20.152 --> 02:22.821
No one can ever
bring them together.

02:22.839 --> 02:24.539
My family situation
is complicated.

02:24.590 --> 02:27.325
My parents got divorced
30 years ago

02:27.343 --> 02:30.178
and they hate each other.

02:30.213 --> 02:32.514
Okay, I guess it's not
that complicated.

02:32.548 --> 02:36.134
Okay! You guys pretend
you're Ron Swanson,

02:36.168 --> 02:37.719
and you're trying to decide

02:37.770 --> 02:39.354
whether you want
to invest in this company.

02:39.389 --> 02:40.989
Be super critical.

02:41.024 --> 02:42.124
You're short.

02:42.158 --> 02:44.459
And here...we...go!

02:45.995 --> 02:49.798
Tom Haverford
and Jean-Ralphio Saperstein...

02:49.832 --> 02:52.718
Creators
of Entertainment 720...

02:52.752 --> 02:54.886
Proudly present...

02:54.921 --> 02:58.289
- Rent A Swag!
- Wah!

02:58.307 --> 03:00.142
Parents, are you tired
of watching

03:00.176 --> 03:01.626
your middle-school-aged
children grow out

03:01.644 --> 03:03.645
of the nice clothes
you buy for them?

03:03.680 --> 03:05.681
Then rent them!
From Rent A Swag.

03:05.732 --> 03:07.099
I own it.

03:07.133 --> 03:09.935
You rent it.
You wear it.

03:09.969 --> 03:12.320
You clean it.
You return it.

03:12.355 --> 03:14.156
I get rich.
Wink!

03:14.190 --> 03:15.306
Rent A Swag!

03:15.324 --> 03:16.441
♪ Where your swag
is my business! ♪

03:16.475 --> 03:18.110
Okay, stop.
You guys, stop!

03:18.144 --> 03:19.244
Stop!

03:19.278 --> 03:20.478
♪ And your business
is my swag ♪

03:20.496 --> 03:21.980
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop!

03:22.014 --> 03:23.865
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Please..

03:23.900 --> 03:25.951
There's actually
a lot more,

03:25.985 --> 03:27.569
but tell us
your thoughts so far.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.421
It's the greatest thing I've
ever seen in my entire life.

03:29.455 --> 03:31.156
- Yes!
- No! It's terrible.

03:31.190 --> 03:32.908
It's terrible,
you guys.

03:32.959 --> 03:34.359
I love you, baby.
You're so smart.

03:34.377 --> 03:36.211
You're presenting this
to Ron Swanson.

03:36.245 --> 03:38.863
Don't talk about any
of your old, failed businesses,

03:38.881 --> 03:40.382
get rid
of that stupid light show,

03:40.416 --> 03:42.534
and definitely don't use
any weird, made-up words

03:42.568 --> 03:44.169
that Ron doesn't understand.

03:44.203 --> 03:45.971
But the presentation's
tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

03:46.005 --> 03:47.506
We don't have time
to start from scratch.

03:47.540 --> 03:51.393
Well, if you do any of that,
he's not gonna invest, so...

03:51.427 --> 03:53.729
Your funeral.

03:53.763 --> 03:54.930
Hey!
I'm glad you're here.

03:54.981 --> 03:56.381
Let's go over the plan.

03:56.399 --> 04:00.218
Okay, you and I go stargazing
in Harvey James park,

04:00.236 --> 04:02.821
while my parents
slowly strangle each other

04:02.855 --> 04:04.106
in the living room.

04:04.157 --> 04:07.058
- No.
Your mom arrives at 7:00.

04:07.076 --> 04:09.411
We hand her a glass
of chilled white wine,

04:09.445 --> 04:11.613
and, oh, look,
my mom is walking over,

04:11.664 --> 04:13.498
and they're both
educators and mothers.

04:13.533 --> 04:15.250
What a fabulous coincidence.

04:15.284 --> 04:17.536
Then later, Stephen Wyatt
shows up--that's your dad.

04:17.570 --> 04:19.120
Yes.
He's terrifying.

04:19.172 --> 04:20.589
We make some small talk,

04:20.623 --> 04:22.072
and 30 minutes later,

04:22.091 --> 04:25.627
I show everybody
the big surprise.

04:25.678 --> 04:27.245
The Knope-Wyatt unity quilt.

04:27.263 --> 04:28.597
Ben and I are weaving
our lives together,

04:28.631 --> 04:30.465
so I have woven this quilt.

04:30.516 --> 04:34.770
It represents every member
of our new united family.

04:34.804 --> 04:36.721
Of all my metaphorical
art projects,

04:36.755 --> 04:38.756
this is by far
the coziest.

04:38.775 --> 04:40.976
- This is amazing.
- I know.

04:41.027 --> 04:42.260
I worked really hard on it.

04:42.278 --> 04:43.695
And, out of respect,

04:43.729 --> 04:45.930
I did not include any images
of the only other man

04:45.948 --> 04:48.099
in the world
who's as sexy as you, Joe Biden.

04:48.117 --> 04:49.568
- Yes, you did, right there.
- Hmm?

04:49.602 --> 04:51.987
Oh, well,
that's just a little one.

04:52.038 --> 04:54.573
The point is, this quilt is
going to unite the Wyatt clan.

04:54.607 --> 04:58.443
It's beautiful,
and it won't.

04:59.629 --> 05:01.296
Everyone,
before everyone else gets here,

05:01.330 --> 05:03.582
I'd like to make
a little toast.

05:03.616 --> 05:07.335
My romantic life has been
a bit of a mixed bag lately.

05:07.386 --> 05:11.139
And when that's the case,
it's hard not to be cynical

05:11.174 --> 05:13.458
about love and relationships,
but it's couples like you

05:13.476 --> 05:14.959
that give hope
to the rest of us.

05:14.977 --> 05:18.480
Leslie, you deserve the best,
and you found it.

05:18.514 --> 05:21.633
Ben, don't you dare hurt her.

05:21.651 --> 05:22.767
I won't.

05:22.801 --> 05:25.136
Don't laugh.
She means it.

05:25.154 --> 05:26.521
Okay, I-I won't.

05:26.572 --> 05:29.157
Seriously, son,
don't hurt her.

05:29.192 --> 05:31.276
Okay, I'm not planning
on hurting her.

05:31.310 --> 05:33.295
- You better not be.
- I'm not!

05:33.329 --> 05:35.997
Hey, Ben,
you best watch yourself.

05:36.048 --> 05:37.549
Why would any of you think
I would hurt Leslie?

05:37.583 --> 05:39.450
You're all my friends too.

05:39.468 --> 05:40.836
Nah.

05:40.887 --> 05:42.504
This was literally

05:42.555 --> 05:45.390
the most beautiful
and moving thing

05:45.424 --> 05:48.960
that I have ever heard.

05:48.978 --> 05:50.295
There, there,
baby boy.

05:50.313 --> 05:54.299
Take all the time you need.

05:54.317 --> 05:57.018
Well, sure, in a wrestling
match, Kirk would win.

05:57.069 --> 05:58.803
But overall, who would you
rather have at the helm

05:58.821 --> 06:00.989
of your
Sovereign-class starship?

06:01.023 --> 06:02.741
Jean-Luc Picard.
No contest.

06:02.775 --> 06:03.975
Hey, your mom's here.
I need you.

06:03.993 --> 06:05.327
Thank God.

06:05.361 --> 06:07.529
- There's my boy!
- Hey, Mom.

06:07.580 --> 06:08.780
Nice to see you.

06:08.814 --> 06:10.999
This is Leslie Knope,
my fiancee.

06:11.033 --> 06:13.318
Hi. It's--it's really nice
to finally meet you, Ms. Wyatt.

06:13.336 --> 06:14.786
Oh! Please call me Julia.

06:14.820 --> 06:16.821
Is your father here yet?

06:16.839 --> 06:19.541
- No fighting tonight, Mom.
- Don't worry!

06:19.592 --> 06:20.959
I'm going to be civil,
as long as he is.

06:20.993 --> 06:23.545
Frankly, after what he did
at Geoffrey's graduation--

06:23.596 --> 06:25.630
Oh, I have some white wine
for you, some Chardonnay.

06:25.664 --> 06:27.716
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:27.767 --> 06:30.302
Right this way.

06:32.772 --> 06:35.807
- Hey, you guys, come on in.
- Thank you.

06:38.344 --> 06:41.179
Ann.

06:41.197 --> 06:42.314
Hey.

06:42.348 --> 06:44.199
You all right, man?

06:44.233 --> 06:46.451
The toast that you gave
to Ben and Leslie

06:46.485 --> 06:47.569
was so beautiful,

06:47.620 --> 06:51.156
and I'm feeling very raw
from my therapy.

06:51.190 --> 06:56.027
I am so happy...
And so sad.

06:56.045 --> 06:59.164
It's like a perfect storm
of emotions.

06:59.198 --> 07:04.669
And so I'm hiding out here,
so I don't ruin this party

07:04.703 --> 07:07.205
for my two amazing
best friends

07:07.223 --> 07:09.641
who I love so much.

07:09.675 --> 07:10.759
Oh!

07:10.810 --> 07:13.211
There's no more tissue.

07:13.229 --> 07:14.712
- Everything ends!
- No, no, no.

07:14.730 --> 07:16.431
No, there's more tissue.

07:16.482 --> 07:20.235
- There's--
- Everything goes away.

07:20.269 --> 07:22.187
And I said,
rules or no rules,

07:22.221 --> 07:23.488
I just have to kiss
that beautiful face.

07:24.690 --> 07:26.057
Well, that's
a Knope woman for you.

07:26.075 --> 07:27.859
When we see something adorable,
we attack it.

07:27.893 --> 07:30.561
He is adorable,
isn't he?

07:30.579 --> 07:32.747
You chose well, Benny.

07:32.782 --> 07:34.783
Aw, thank you.

07:34.834 --> 07:35.900
So far, so good.

07:35.918 --> 07:37.035
I'll admit it.

07:37.069 --> 07:38.286
Things are going
surprisingly well.

07:38.337 --> 07:39.671
Yeah.

07:39.705 --> 07:41.006
And pack it up.
It's over, we're screwed.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.340
He brought his girlfriend?

07:42.375 --> 07:43.792
He wasn't supposed
to bring his girlfriend, Ben.

07:43.843 --> 07:45.343
Oh, Ben!

07:45.378 --> 07:47.262
Your father brought
his little plaything.

07:47.296 --> 07:48.913
- Hiya, Benny.
- Hey, Dad, hi.

07:48.931 --> 07:51.466
Hi.

07:51.517 --> 07:52.583
Unh.

07:52.601 --> 07:54.252
Hi, Ulani.

07:54.270 --> 07:56.054
Thought you weren't coming.

07:56.088 --> 07:59.274
Ulani is my girlfriend,
and she's important to me,

07:59.308 --> 08:00.608
and I need her here.

08:00.643 --> 08:02.944
Ulani, hi, I'm Leslie.
What a wonderful surprise.

08:02.979 --> 08:04.612
We're so happy
that you're here.

08:04.647 --> 08:06.948
What the hell, Steve?
They didn't know I was coming?

08:06.983 --> 08:09.934
We didn't know
it was spring break.

08:09.952 --> 08:11.152
Okay, thanks, everybody,
for coming.

08:11.203 --> 08:12.871
I'm so sorry
you all have to go home.

08:12.905 --> 08:15.457
Hey, Red Vines anyone?

08:15.491 --> 08:18.493
We're a Twizzlers family.

08:20.513 --> 08:22.014
Okay, we are off to a rocky start,

08:22.013 --> 08:23.514
but we are gonna fix this.

08:23.548 --> 08:25.933
Yes, we will.
I called a cab.

08:25.934 --> 08:26.966
It's outside.

08:26.967 --> 08:29.686
I gave the driver 100 bucks
to sit and wait,

08:29.720 --> 08:32.188
so whenever
we're ready to go--

08:32.222 --> 08:33.389
like, maybe right now--

08:33.424 --> 08:35.140
all we have to do
is walk outside.

08:35.192 --> 08:38.061
No, I want to be here now,
with you and your parents.

08:38.095 --> 08:39.261
Help me make this work.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.364
Okay, fine.
Best thing to do is

08:41.398 --> 08:43.399
distract them
with innocuous talk

08:43.433 --> 08:45.702
- about the stuff they care about.
- Great, like what?

08:45.736 --> 08:47.904
Well, they're white people
from Minnesota,

08:47.938 --> 08:50.240
so hockey, fishing, skiing,
sailing, and after a few drinks,

08:50.274 --> 08:51.741
put on a Prince album.

08:51.775 --> 08:53.293
Don't mention
the Green Bay Packers

08:53.327 --> 08:55.444
or the state of Iowa.
And also,

08:55.462 --> 08:56.713
I have enough
frequent flyer miles

08:56.747 --> 08:58.464
to get us to Australia
tonight.

08:58.499 --> 08:59.883
- Everything okay?
- Uh, slight speed bump.

08:59.917 --> 09:02.886
Everything is terrible,
but I am going to fix it

09:02.920 --> 09:04.087
with my secret weapon.

09:04.121 --> 09:05.621
Okay, well I will make sure

09:05.639 --> 09:06.789
that everything else
runs smoothly.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.224
Ann, you are such
a good friend.

09:08.259 --> 09:11.961
You are a beautiful, talented,
brilliant, powerful musk ox.

09:11.979 --> 09:14.898
Thank you, ox,
for keeping this ship afloat.

09:14.932 --> 09:16.516
You got it.

09:16.567 --> 09:18.935
Guys, I need your help,
okay?

09:18.969 --> 09:21.154
Chris is in the back room,
and he's crying.

09:21.188 --> 09:22.805
Go in there, calm him down,
make him feel better.

09:22.823 --> 09:25.158
Leslie and Ben have enough
to deal with, okay?

09:25.192 --> 09:27.026
Thank you.
Wait, why is Chris crying?

09:27.077 --> 09:30.530
- Uh, he's emotional.
- Wait, why is Chris emotional?

09:30.581 --> 09:32.498
Because he's
in therapy right now,

09:32.533 --> 09:33.917
and it's dredging up
a lot of stuff for him.

09:33.951 --> 09:36.085
Wait, wait,
like what kind of stuff?

09:36.120 --> 09:37.954
Like, I don't know,
his friends are getting married,

09:37.988 --> 09:39.322
and he's not
dating anyone.

09:39.340 --> 09:41.291
Why isn't
he dating anyone?

09:41.325 --> 09:43.326
Yeah, why don't you
date him?

09:43.344 --> 09:45.428
Because I'm dating myself
right now, okay?

09:45.462 --> 09:48.181
I'm--I'm trying to figure out
how to make me happy.

09:48.215 --> 09:49.665
Ugh, why is it always
about you, Ann?

09:49.683 --> 09:50.883
Self-centered much?

09:50.935 --> 09:53.172
Just go, okay?
Thank you.

09:55.806 --> 09:57.390
- Ron in 60 seconds.
- Tom.

09:57.441 --> 09:58.858
I haven't seen you tonight.

09:58.892 --> 10:01.277
I've been working
on my presentation.

10:01.312 --> 10:02.612
I just came by
to congratulate Leslie,

10:02.646 --> 10:03.780
and then I'm heading back.

10:03.814 --> 10:05.365
I admire
the work ethic.

10:05.399 --> 10:07.617
I'm always looking
for new investments.

10:07.651 --> 10:10.186
Ever since I got my first job
at the age of nine,

10:10.204 --> 10:12.372
I have put
all my money into gold,

10:12.406 --> 10:14.523
which is currently
at an all-time high.

10:14.541 --> 10:20.129
So I have
a certain amount of money.

10:20.164 --> 10:22.298
I've said too much.

10:22.333 --> 10:24.467
Looking forward
to tomorrow.

10:24.501 --> 10:26.219
Yes...
About that.

10:26.253 --> 10:29.255
I was wondering, is there
any chance we could reschedule?

10:29.306 --> 10:30.757
I just want to make sure
everything is up

10:30.808 --> 10:32.058
to my world-class "standees."

10:32.092 --> 10:34.844
I like to keep
my appointments, son,

10:34.878 --> 10:36.312
and I like others
to do the same.

10:36.347 --> 10:39.565
Of course, yes.
No problem, 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.818
I think you're gonna be
very impressed

10:41.852 --> 10:43.486
with our presentation.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.606
"Our presentation"?
Who else is joining you?

10:46.657 --> 10:47.940
Ricka ricka ricka ricka!

10:50.611 --> 10:51.727
Swanson.

10:51.745 --> 10:53.562
- Jean-Ralphio.
- That's me.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.832
I didn't realize
you were a part of this.

10:55.866 --> 10:57.417
Of course he is.
He's my business partner.

10:57.451 --> 11:00.837
Shh! Clean!

11:00.871 --> 11:02.789
Business partner,
now and forever.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.741
Hold up!
Forever 21.

11:05.759 --> 11:07.760
21-gun salute.
<i>Salute your shorts.</i>

11:07.795 --> 11:09.078
Kaboosh!

11:09.096 --> 11:10.930
I just free-associated
all over the "mousse-tache."

11:10.964 --> 11:12.748
That's just one
of many skills he brings

11:12.766 --> 11:13.916
to this business partnership.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.635
What are those, shrimp?
Ah!

11:15.686 --> 11:19.105
Okay.
Rethink that move, son.

11:19.139 --> 11:21.757
Let's just drive back.
I feel weird.

11:21.775 --> 11:24.360
Steve, you like sailing,
right?

11:24.395 --> 11:26.229
Not any more, since Julia
got the boat in the divorce

11:26.263 --> 11:28.097
and then sold it
to a scrapyard

11:28.115 --> 11:29.932
because she's terrible.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.100
Well, at least
you don't have to deal

11:31.118 --> 11:33.036
with all that boat upkeep now,
right, huh?

11:33.070 --> 11:34.370
Yech, no thankee.

11:34.405 --> 11:36.489
Let's talk about something
other than sailing.

11:36.540 --> 11:37.707
Why don't you head
in the other room?

11:37.741 --> 11:40.293
I have a surprise that--
there she goes.

11:40.327 --> 11:42.795
There's a surprise for you,
so, um, head on in.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.714
I don't like surprises.

11:44.748 --> 11:46.049
Okay, look,
you gave it a try,

11:46.083 --> 11:48.668
but this quilt thing
is not going to work.

11:48.719 --> 11:50.386
Ben, on three separate occasions,

11:50.421 --> 11:52.588
I have used a quilt
to mend fences.

11:52.622 --> 11:54.507
In ninth grade,
a quilt ended an argument

11:54.558 --> 11:55.791
between my two best friends,

11:55.809 --> 11:57.643
and a quilt settled

11:57.678 --> 12:00.146
the Donna-Jerry
parking lot feud of 2006.

12:00.180 --> 12:01.630
What was the third time?

12:01.648 --> 12:03.632
Right [Bleep] now.

12:03.650 --> 12:05.234
Okay, I still don't think
it's gonna work,

12:05.269 --> 12:07.153
but I am really attracted
to you right now.

12:07.187 --> 12:10.490
I know.
Let's do this.

12:11.641 --> 12:12.641
Police, open up!
We have a warrant!

12:12.659 --> 12:13.743
Just kidding, it's us.

12:13.777 --> 12:15.862
- Ha, we got you!
- Andy and April.

12:15.913 --> 12:17.146
We have someone
who wants to see you!

12:17.164 --> 12:18.664
Champion!

12:18.699 --> 12:20.533
Come here.
Hey, big boy.

12:20.584 --> 12:22.818
You are such
a brave, good dog,

12:22.836 --> 12:24.253
with so much spirit.

12:24.288 --> 12:25.538
You've overcome so much.

12:25.589 --> 12:30.259
You are the most wonderful dog
in the whole world.

12:30.294 --> 12:31.844
And I am so happy for you.

12:33.514 --> 12:36.048
Okay, everyone, I have
a surprise for all of you.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.050
Voila!

12:38.102 --> 12:41.670
The Knope-Wyatt unity quilt!

12:41.688 --> 12:45.007
It represents our two families
coming together,

12:45.025 --> 12:46.675
and there is a personalized
square for each member

12:46.693 --> 12:48.895
of our joint family, see?

12:48.946 --> 12:51.447
- Sweetheart, this is lovely.
- Thanks, Mom.

12:51.482 --> 12:53.783
Where's my square?

12:53.817 --> 12:55.351
Well,
you're not technically--

12:55.369 --> 12:57.954
- Not technically what?
- Not technically an adult.

12:57.988 --> 13:00.706
This is a very thoughtless
omission, Leslie,

13:00.741 --> 13:03.692
and as far as I'm concerned,
if there's no Ulani square,

13:03.710 --> 13:06.078
this is not
a legitimate unity quilt.

13:06.130 --> 13:08.131
- Oh, that old Chestnut.
- Okay.

13:08.165 --> 13:11.367
I will make
an Ulani square.

13:11.385 --> 13:14.036
Very, very easy.
Okay.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.421
Look, this is your square now.

13:15.472 --> 13:16.889
What does "Ulani" mean?

13:16.924 --> 13:18.391
"Cheerful."

13:18.425 --> 13:19.926
Sure.

13:19.977 --> 13:22.762
All right.
Look at that.

13:22.813 --> 13:25.714
Unity! It's that simple.
All we had to do was--

13:25.732 --> 13:27.383
I don't want her name
on my quilt.

13:27.401 --> 13:29.552
It's not your--
it's everyone's quilt.

13:29.570 --> 13:31.053
It's a unity quilt.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.322
I think it's mean that
you didn't do a square for me.

13:33.357 --> 13:34.824
It's a disaster
is what it is.

13:34.858 --> 13:36.409
You can say that again,
Steve.

13:36.443 --> 13:38.394
See, Ben,
they're agreeing.

13:38.412 --> 13:39.779
It's working.

13:39.830 --> 13:40.947
Okay, I'm thinking

13:40.998 --> 13:43.699
we junk everything
except the mannequins.

13:43.733 --> 13:45.234
Ron's gotta see how dope
the outfits are.

13:45.252 --> 13:46.586
That's the business.

13:46.620 --> 13:49.121
Why are we going to Ron?
Ron should be coming to us!

13:49.173 --> 13:50.756
We created
Entertainment 720.

13:50.791 --> 13:51.958
Which was
a huge failure.

13:52.009 --> 13:53.176
I don't know--

13:53.210 --> 13:54.743
Look, a bank's
not gonna give us a loan,

13:54.761 --> 13:58.214
and Ron loves
my entrepreneurial spirit.

13:58.248 --> 14:00.299
Trust me, he's our best chance
at getting start-up money.

14:00.350 --> 14:01.968
I hear that.
Let's go clubbing.

14:02.019 --> 14:03.436
No, we gotta work.

14:03.470 --> 14:04.437
Didn't you hear me say
we gotta junk

14:04.471 --> 14:05.588
most of the presentation?

14:05.606 --> 14:08.057
Tommy, I will always
be there for you,

14:08.091 --> 14:09.775
no matter what,
but right now,

14:09.810 --> 14:12.278
I cannot be there for you
because I have to go.

14:12.312 --> 14:15.031
I hate to say this, but...

14:15.065 --> 14:18.618
Sometimes you've gotta work
a little,

14:18.652 --> 14:20.953
so you can ball a lot.

14:20.988 --> 14:23.439
That was beautiful.

14:23.457 --> 14:27.943
That changed me.
I'll give you ten minutes.

14:27.961 --> 14:30.379
You have to try
to eat something, okay?

14:34.635 --> 14:37.003
Mmm!
Wow, that's amazing.

14:37.054 --> 14:40.172
See? There you go.

14:40.224 --> 14:41.641
This one's not as good.

14:41.675 --> 14:43.226
All right, Chris,
here's the plan.

14:43.260 --> 14:45.177
I'm just gonna list off
happy things

14:45.229 --> 14:47.096
until you're cheered up.

14:47.130 --> 14:50.399
Pizza, the beach,
rock and roll music--

14:50.434 --> 14:52.485
- and I'll list terrible things
to bring you back down.

14:52.519 --> 14:54.987
Smallpox,
botched surgery,

14:55.022 --> 14:57.156
snails crawling
out of your mouth.

14:57.190 --> 14:59.659
This is weirdly working.
It's evening me out.

14:59.693 --> 15:01.944
- Okay, keep going, keep going.
- Laughter.

15:01.978 --> 15:02.978
Snails crawling
out of your mouth.

15:02.996 --> 15:03.996
- The beach.
- Snails crawling out

15:04.031 --> 15:05.765
- out of your mouth.
- Cute cats.

15:05.799 --> 15:07.033
Snails crawling
out of your butt.

15:07.084 --> 15:08.701
Dave Matthews Band.

15:08.752 --> 15:10.336
Dave Matthews Band.

15:10.370 --> 15:13.256
Look, Dad, Leslie worked
really hard on this,

15:13.290 --> 15:15.708
so can you just cool it
for, like, 30 seconds?

15:15.759 --> 15:18.094
Sure, I can.

15:18.128 --> 15:19.995
But your mother can't.
See?

15:20.013 --> 15:22.498
She's ruining your quilt,

15:22.516 --> 15:24.216
just like she ruined
our marriage!

15:24.268 --> 15:25.468
Mom!

15:25.502 --> 15:26.835
Oh, I didn't know
we could cut that.

15:26.853 --> 15:27.937
It had to be done, Ben.

15:27.971 --> 15:30.389
It absolutely
did not have to be done.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.441
Look, champagne!

15:32.476 --> 15:34.176
Yeah, why don't we
just forget about the quilt

15:34.194 --> 15:36.812
- and just raise a glass?
- Yes! Toasts are fun.

15:36.846 --> 15:38.731
They usually signify
the end of a party.

15:38.782 --> 15:39.848
Here you are, Ulani.

15:39.866 --> 15:41.117
I'm good, thanks.

15:41.151 --> 15:42.618
Oh, by all means,
go ahead and take it, Ulani.

15:42.653 --> 15:44.520
Or, wait, are you even
old enough to drink?

15:44.538 --> 15:46.322
Yes, Julia, I am,

15:46.356 --> 15:49.625
but I can't
because I'm pregnant.

15:49.660 --> 15:50.743
You're what?

15:50.794 --> 15:52.078
Oh, boy.

15:52.129 --> 15:53.462
I didn't mean
to steal your spotlight,

15:53.497 --> 15:54.697
but the cat's
out of the bag.

15:54.715 --> 15:59.335
Young Ben is going to have
a new baby sister, huh?

15:59.369 --> 16:02.204
Still firing bullets, son.

16:02.222 --> 16:03.923
I cannot be
in the same room as him.

16:03.974 --> 16:05.224
What about the wedding?

16:05.258 --> 16:08.377
I'm talking
about the wedding.

16:08.395 --> 16:12.014
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Wyatt family.

16:14.005 --> 16:15.921
It's like the war of the Wyatts out there!

16:15.922 --> 16:18.891
- I mean, it's so brutal!
- Oh, my God.

16:18.925 --> 16:20.192
Were you and Dad
ever like that?

16:20.376 --> 16:22.344
Well,
like any married couple,

16:22.378 --> 16:24.329
honey, your father and I
fought occasionally,

16:24.364 --> 16:27.015
and sometimes
he won the argument,

16:27.050 --> 16:28.634
and sometimes I won.

16:28.685 --> 16:31.220
But usually, we forgot
what we were arguing about

16:31.254 --> 16:32.521
and just had sex.

16:32.555 --> 16:34.422
- La la la la la.
- Anyway, the important thing

16:34.440 --> 16:38.277
is that we always ended up
on the same team.

16:38.311 --> 16:39.811
And in the same bed.

16:40.930 --> 16:43.115
God, I miss that man.

16:43.149 --> 16:44.900
How can you be so wise
and so inappropriate

16:44.934 --> 16:46.601
at the same time?

16:46.619 --> 16:48.937
I'm a parent.

16:50.290 --> 16:51.657
I can't figure out how to phrase
this mission statement.

16:51.708 --> 16:52.958
Let me get a shot at it.

16:52.992 --> 16:54.109
I'm actually pretty good
at this stuff.

16:56.329 --> 16:57.546
See?

16:57.580 --> 16:59.548
You just googled,
"Amanda Bynes side boob."

16:59.582 --> 17:00.916
What's wrong with you?

17:00.950 --> 17:02.801
What's wrong with you?
Why is your safesearch on?

17:02.835 --> 17:05.671
That is amateur hour, Tom.

17:05.722 --> 17:08.390
Listen, we've been at this
for an entire evening.

17:08.424 --> 17:10.175
I say, why don't
we cut our losses?

17:10.226 --> 17:12.728
If it was such a good idea,
we would be millionaires by now.

17:12.762 --> 17:13.811
Hello.

17:13.846 --> 17:15.597
Look, man,
I believe in this idea.

17:15.631 --> 17:18.150
Do you?

17:18.184 --> 17:20.301
You know
I love you, but...

17:20.319 --> 17:22.186
I don't think you're as serious
about this business as I am.

17:22.238 --> 17:25.807
Oh, yeah, no,
I'm definitely not.

17:38.421 --> 17:40.205
Hey, I got your text.
What are you doing?

17:40.256 --> 17:42.174
I grabbed all of the brownies
from the dessert table

17:42.208 --> 17:43.425
and four bottles of wine.

17:43.459 --> 17:44.676
Get in the car.
We're going to Australia.

17:44.711 --> 17:46.545
- Leslie--
- I am so sorry for everything.

17:46.596 --> 17:48.931
I love you,
and I want to be on your team.

17:48.965 --> 17:50.549
I am on your team,
but I think that

17:50.600 --> 17:52.184
our team should be
far away from here.

17:52.218 --> 17:54.353
Normally, I would get
in the cab with you,

17:54.387 --> 17:57.505
but I am so sick of them
ruining everything,

17:57.523 --> 17:59.391
and I really liked
that unity quilt.

17:59.442 --> 18:02.144
- It was a good quilt.
- It was an awesome quilt.

18:02.178 --> 18:04.446
Look, my parents are insane,

18:04.480 --> 18:06.782
but they need to be
at our wedding.

18:06.816 --> 18:08.116
You know what?

18:08.151 --> 18:09.785
It's time for this team

18:09.819 --> 18:11.486
- to come up with a new plan.
- I agree.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.622
Phase one of our new plan,
you get in the backseat

18:13.656 --> 18:15.907
of this cab, and we hardcore
make out for 15 minutes.

18:15.959 --> 18:17.292
I would love
to do that.

18:17.327 --> 18:19.127
I'm just not sure if the driver
would be okay with it.

18:19.162 --> 18:21.663
For another 100 bucks,
you can do whatever you want.

18:22.197 --> 18:23.665
Let's do this.

18:25.969 --> 18:27.419
Swan song!

18:27.470 --> 18:28.837
What up, my man?

18:28.871 --> 18:31.390
- Ow, are you kidding me?
- Jean-Ralphio.

18:31.424 --> 18:33.675
I thought you and Tom were
working on your presentation.

18:33.709 --> 18:36.645
No, I decided it was best
if I took my talents elsewhere.

18:36.679 --> 18:38.847
- Do you know what I mean?
- You abandoned your friend?

18:38.881 --> 18:40.849
God, no.
He fired me, straight up.

18:40.883 --> 18:42.651
Talked about how I
wasn't serious enough

18:42.685 --> 18:43.718
about the project,

18:43.736 --> 18:45.320
how he needed to grow up.

18:45.355 --> 18:47.773
Anyway, I have an amazing
investment idea for you.

18:47.824 --> 18:49.741
Condoms with pictures
on them.

18:49.776 --> 18:50.993
- Pass.
- Good. Smart.

18:51.027 --> 18:52.327
I think you made
the right decision.

18:52.362 --> 18:54.896
Take care.

18:54.914 --> 18:57.499
Oh. Chris?

18:57.533 --> 19:00.335
Seems like the storm has passed.
Indeed it has.

19:00.370 --> 19:02.704
I can't believe that I spent
the entire party in a room

19:02.738 --> 19:05.424
being happy-sad
on a night that means so much

19:05.458 --> 19:06.708
to my two best friends.

19:06.742 --> 19:08.076
I mean,
you're going through a lot.

19:08.094 --> 19:10.512
You need to purge all this stuff
that's been building up.

19:10.546 --> 19:12.848
This lesbian nurse
is right, Chris.

19:12.882 --> 19:14.749
You can't keep it
all bottled up.

19:14.767 --> 19:16.935
Maybe you're right.
Maybe all of my emotions

19:16.969 --> 19:19.388
tumbling out like this means
that I can get a clean start.

19:19.422 --> 19:20.922
Well, for that,
you're gonna have to visit

19:20.940 --> 19:21.923
the bathroom first.

19:21.941 --> 19:23.225
- Right?
- No.

19:23.259 --> 19:24.592
- Ann Perkins!
- Nope.

19:24.610 --> 19:27.396
You are, without a doubt,
the queen of toilet humor.

19:27.430 --> 19:31.983
That's all
I ever wanted to be.

19:32.035 --> 19:34.419
This was supposed to be
a happy occasion.

19:34.454 --> 19:36.154
You were
supposed to come here,

19:36.189 --> 19:39.374
celebrate your son's engagement,
maybe bury the ax?

19:39.409 --> 19:40.675
And not
in each other's back.

19:40.710 --> 19:44.112
But it did not
work out that way.

19:44.130 --> 19:45.547
So here is the new plan.

19:45.581 --> 19:47.315
I don't expect you
to like each other,

19:47.350 --> 19:49.451
but you have to come
to the wedding, okay?

19:49.469 --> 19:50.952
We'll seat you far away
from each other.

19:50.970 --> 19:52.137
You don't even
have to socialize.

19:52.171 --> 19:54.005
Yeah, in fact,
we insist that you don't.

19:54.057 --> 19:55.790
But you do have
to show up

19:55.808 --> 19:57.292
and tell us
that you had a great time.

19:57.310 --> 19:58.643
That's the deal.

19:58.678 --> 20:00.962
You can either take it,
or you can take it.

20:00.980 --> 20:03.631
I can take it.
I'm sorry.

20:03.649 --> 20:06.568
- I'm sorry too, Benny.
- Sorry. Whatever.

20:06.602 --> 20:08.320
Aw,
what a beautiful apology.

20:08.354 --> 20:09.471
- Julia...
- Guys.

20:09.489 --> 20:10.472
Sorry.

20:10.490 --> 20:12.240
Ben's parents are insane,

20:12.275 --> 20:13.408
but he is not.
He's amazing.

20:13.443 --> 20:15.694
And that's all that matters.

20:15.745 --> 20:17.996
I guess he might
become insane as he ages.

20:18.030 --> 20:21.083
I should keep an eye out
for that.

20:21.117 --> 20:22.834
Also, for the record,
my unity quilt worked.

20:22.869 --> 20:25.837
So technically, I am three
for three with unity quilts.

20:25.872 --> 20:27.005
We only have
30 bucks left.

20:27.039 --> 20:28.173
Let's go.
Oh, okay.

20:28.207 --> 20:29.541
Get ready, driver.

20:29.592 --> 20:32.010
We're gonna make out so hard
in the back of your cab.

20:36.850 --> 20:38.990
Are you okay, son?
Did you get any sleep?

20:39.052 --> 20:41.737
Uh, not really.
I stayed up most of the night.

20:42.089 --> 20:45.073
But that's not important.

20:45.075 --> 20:47.042
Let me tell you
about Rent A Swag.

20:47.044 --> 20:48.209
- Now--
- No need, Tom.

20:48.211 --> 20:49.794
I'm in.

20:49.796 --> 20:52.530
I like doing business
with serious people,

20:52.532 --> 20:55.984
and when you removed yourself
from the company of that moron,

20:55.986 --> 20:58.486
you showed me
you're a serious person.

20:58.488 --> 21:00.505
- You have your start-up money.
- Wow.

21:00.507 --> 21:02.824
I appreciate it.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.009
Tommy "T"!

21:04.011 --> 21:06.595
You just missed the craziest
of crazies.

21:06.597 --> 21:08.513
Clubs. Girls. Dancing.

21:08.515 --> 21:11.016
Naked. Mom? Argument.

21:11.018 --> 21:13.635
Police. Fleeing the scene.
Hiding in a Dumpster.

21:13.637 --> 21:14.836
Coming here.

21:14.838 --> 21:16.521
Crashing on your couch
for a week 'cause

21:16.523 --> 21:18.974
♪ technically,
I'm homeless ♪

21:18.976 --> 21:20.442
Hey, "mousse-tache."
I'ma hit the couch.

21:20.444 --> 21:22.176
You know where I be.
