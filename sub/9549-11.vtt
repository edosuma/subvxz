AMANDA.

00:56.189 --> 00:57.290
- WHAT IS ALL THIS?

00:57.325 --> 00:59.159
- IT'S COMPLICATED.

00:59.192 --> 01:00.360
- REALLY?
IT DOESN'T LOOK COMPLICATED.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.096
- IT LOOKS PRETTY SIMPLE.
- GIVE ME 2 MINUTES TO EXPLAIN.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.496
- "I NEVER FELT
THIS WAY BEFORE"?

01:03.530 --> 01:04.698
"HEAVEN MUST BE MISSING
AN ANGEL"?

01:04.731 --> 01:05.698
- DON'T GET HYSTERICAL.
- WHAT WAS ALL THAT?

01:05.733 --> 01:08.701
- AMANDA, WOULD YOU--
- DON'T! DON'T TOUCH ME!

01:08.736 --> 01:10.670

TO LET ME EXPLAIN?

01:10.704 --> 01:13.441
PLEASE?
[sigh]

01:13.474 --> 01:14.641
TECHNICALLY, YES,

FOR A LONG TIME.

01:17.344 --> 01:19.112
WE JUST HAVEN'T
MADE IT OFFICIAL.

01:19.146 --> 01:21.149
YOU WERE MARRIED.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.

01:21.182 --> 01:24.751
AMANDA, IT'S OVER.

01:24.784 --> 01:26.254
MY HAND TO GOD.

01:26.287 --> 01:29.356
- MY HAND TO GOD, HUH?

01:29.390 --> 01:32.225
THEN YOU WON'T MIND
IF WE GET RID OF THIS.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.260

FOR COMING.

- WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:18.738 --> 07:19.939
- MISSING PERSON.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.240
I HOPE THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.610
- HER NAME'S
AMANDA CASTLE.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.776
SHE'S AN ARTIST.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.211
APPARENTLY, SHE'S
A PRETTY BIG DEAL,

07:25.245 --> 07:26.213
VERY FAMOUS.

- HUH.
NEVER HEARD OF HER.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.447
- ME, NEITHER.

07:28.481 --> 07:29.382
- WELL, SOMEBODY'S
HEARD OF HER,

07:29.415 --> 07:30.382
BECAUSE THE PRESS
HAS TAKEN AN INTEREST,

07:30.417 --> 07:32.886
WHICH MEANS THE MAYOR HAS
TAKEN AN INTEREST,

07:32.920 --> 07:34.555
WHICH MEANS I'M HERE,

07:34.588 --> 07:36.557
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE HERE,
AND YOU.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.057
- HEY, HOW WAS THE PICNIC?
- HORRIBLE.

TO MEET HER AT MY GALLERY.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.641
SHE HAS A SHOW
NEXT MONTH.

07:53.673 --> 07:55.141
I WAS JUST TELLING
THE CAPTAIN

07:55.175 --> 07:56.909
SOMETHING'S WRONG.
I CAN FEEL IT.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.245
I'VE KNOWN AMANDA
FOR YEARS,

07:58.278 --> 07:59.680
AND SHE NEVER WOULD
HAVE GONE ANYWHERE

07:59.713 --> 08:01.814
WITHOUT HER MEDICATION
OR WITHOUT SHELBY.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.283
- AND SHELBY
IS HER DAUGHTER?

08:03.315 --> 08:04.517
- NO.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.519
- SHELBY IS HER SON?

08:06.553 --> 08:08.622
- HERE SHE IS.
COME HERE, GIRL.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.658
THERE'S A GOOD GIRL.

08:10.690 --> 08:13.927
- IT'S A DOG.
SHELBY IS A DOG!

08:13.961 --> 08:16.596
- WELL, SHE'S
THE ONLY FAMILY AMANDA HAS.

08:16.629 --> 08:17.630
- FAMILY.

08:28.975 --> 08:30.177
DID AMANDA WEAR GLASSES?

08:30.209 --> 08:31.678
- NO.

08:31.711 --> 08:33.614
- HMM.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.783
SOMEBODY WORE GLASSES.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.190
WAS SHE DATING?
WAS THERE ANYONE IN PARTICULAR?

08:43.222 --> 08:45.057
- SHE DIDN'T SAY.
SHE NEVER DID.

08:45.091 --> 08:46.793
SHE'S
A PRETTY PRIVATE PERSON.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.761
- MM-HMM.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.736
ARE THOSE GLASSES?

09:01.140 --> 09:02.643
- LOOKS LIKE IT.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.043
DID SOMEBODY POSE
FOR THIS?

09:04.076 --> 09:06.212
- I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK IT'S NEW.

09:06.245 --> 09:07.847
- COULD BE A LOVER.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.783
- HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

09:09.817 --> 09:11.652
- WELL, HE'S NAKED,

OH, I THOUGHT THAT
WAS THE SIGNATURE.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.764
WE NEED TO FIND HIM.

09:23.797 --> 09:24.831
- OH, NOT A PROBLEM.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.232
WE'LL JUST MAKE
A COPY OF THIS

09:26.265 --> 09:27.735
AND PUT OUT AN A.P.B.

09:27.768 --> 09:28.467
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA WORK.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.937
YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE
HIS FACE.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.605
- I WAS JOKING, RANDY.

09:31.639 --> 09:32.840
- MMM.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.875
COURSE YOU HAVE
TO SAY THAT NOW.

10:03.235 --> 10:04.705

10:22.422 --> 10:24.725
DOG LIKES YOU.
DOG'S BEEN FOLLOWING YOU AROUND.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.326
- WELL, TELL HER
NOT TO LIKE ME!

10:28.928 --> 10:30.831
DON'T LIKE ME,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

10:30.864 --> 10:31.831
GO AWAY.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.667
YOU'RE A BAD DOG. GO AWAY.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.368
- SOMEBODY CALL
ANIMAL CONTROL?

10:35.402 --> 10:36.803
- YES, OVER HERE.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.005
THIS IS JUST TEMPORARY
UNTIL AMANDA GETS BACK.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.908
I CAN'T KEEP HER.
I HAVE A CAT.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.809
COME HERE, GIRL.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.010
THANK YOU.

10:44.043 --> 10:46.879
- MR. MONK,
YOU SHOULD ADOPT THE DOG.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.215
- EXCUSE ME?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.817
- JUST FOR A DAY OR TWO
UNTIL THE OWNER GETS BACK.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.220
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU
YOU'RE GETTING LONELY.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.822
- NOT THAT LONELY,

10:54.855 --> 10:56.288
NOT DOG LONELY.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.825
- I THINK YOU ARE DOG LONELY.

10:57.857 --> 10:58.892
DOGS ARE FAMILY.

10:58.926 --> 11:01.094
- NO, NO, DOGS ARE ANIMALS,

11:01.128 --> 11:02.796
AND THEY'RE FILTHY,
THEY'RE NAKED,

11:02.830 --> 11:05.231
AND THEY EAT,
AND THEN THEY UN-EAT,

11:05.264 --> 11:07.801
AND THEN--THAT IS
PROBABLY THE WORST IDEA

11:07.835 --> 11:08.902
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.202
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HER?

11:10.236 --> 11:11.739
- I WOULD,
BUT JULIE'S ALLERGIC.

11:11.772 --> 11:12.905
IT'S JUST FOR A DAY OR TWO.

LET'S GO, GET IN THERE.

11:38.798 --> 11:39.799

11:43.135 --> 11:44.370
WAIT.

11:55.347 --> 11:56.850
I'LL TAKE HER.

EXCUSE ME, HELLO!

18:05.417 --> 18:06.885

18:06.919 --> 18:13.792
WE THINK THAT ONE OF YOU
KILLED AMANDA CASTLE.

18:16.229 --> 18:19.199
IF YOU'RE GUILTY, WOULD YOU
PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND?

18:27.906 --> 18:31.743
WELL, WE WERE JUST WONDERING.

18:41.953 --> 18:43.355

18:43.390 --> 18:45.157
I THINK AMANDA IS DEAD,

18:45.192 --> 18:47.660
AND I THINK HE KILLED HER.

18:47.693 --> 18:48.927
LOOK. LOOK AT THE BUCKLE
AND THE SNAP.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.329
THERE'S NO RUST.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.330
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
LAYING OUT

18:51.364 --> 18:52.898
IN AN OPEN FIELD ALL WEEK.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.201
- HE PLANTED IT. HE'S TRYING
TO FRAME THE EX-HUSBAND.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.836
- WELL, WHAT WAS ALL THAT
ABOUT RAISING YOUR HAND?

18:56.868 --> 18:58.238
HE DIDN'T CONFESS.

18:58.270 --> 19:01.173
- NO, BUT HE DIDN'T
LOOK AROUND, EITHER.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.210
EVERYBODY ELSE DID.

19:15.587 --> 19:16.722
TELL ME WHEN IT'S 2:30.

19:16.756 --> 19:17.824

I'D BE HOME.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.567
- IT'S SHELBY.
A MAN AND HIS DOG.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.201
YOU LOVE HER. I CAN TELL.

19:29.236 --> 19:29.969
- I DON'T LOVE HER.

19:30.001 --> 19:32.338
I DON'T HATE HER.
SHE'S FINE.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.275
I DON'T MIND HER
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS,

19:35.307 --> 19:36.209
MAYBE A WEEK, WHATEVER.

19:36.242 --> 19:38.478
- HOW'S SHE DOING?
- SHE'S REALLY SMART.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.213
THIS DOG IS REALLY,
REALLY SMART.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.548
I'VE BEEN TEACHING HER TRICKS.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.217
- LIKE?

19:44.250 --> 19:46.385
- OH, LIKE NOT TO LICK ME,
NOT TO DROOL,

19:46.419 --> 19:47.287
NOT TO ROLL OVER,

19:47.319 --> 19:49.989
NOT TO, YOU KNOW,
DISCHARGE ANYTHING.

19:50.021 --> 19:51.458
- OH, SINCE YOU MENTION IT,

19:51.490 --> 19:53.960
I WAS GONNA GIVE IT
TO YOU LATER, BUT...

19:53.992 --> 19:55.427
* TA DA!

19:55.461 --> 19:56.596
IT'S A SHA-POOPIE.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.798
- OH, YEAH,
I DON'T NEED THAT,

19:58.830 --> 20:01.000
BECAUSE I'VE TAUGHT HER
TO HOLD IT IN.

20:01.032 --> 20:02.934
- UNTIL WHEN?

20:02.969 --> 20:04.304
- I HAVEN'T DECIDED.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.938
- WELL,
SHE MIGHT DECIDE FOR YOU.

20:05.971 --> 20:06.972
YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.775
- YEAH, OKAY.

20:08.807 --> 20:10.376
- THIS COULD BE IT.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.878
HE GAVE A PHONY NAME
WHEN HE SIGNED IN YESTERDAY,

20:12.912 --> 20:13.880
BUT WE RAN HIS PLATES.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.383
SAY HELLO TO STEVEN DeWITT.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.250
HE'S AN INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER.

20:18.285 --> 20:19.986
HE OWNS, OR, RATHER,
HIS WIFE OWNS

20:20.019 --> 20:23.323
A $2 MILLION BROWNSTONE
ON ROCKAWAY DRIVE.

20:23.355 --> 20:24.257
- THEY KNOW AMANDA?

20:24.290 --> 20:26.259
- VERY POSSIBLE, YEAH.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.794
SHE'S AN ARTIST,
HE'S A BIG PATRON.

20:27.826 --> 20:29.695
APPARENTLY, HE HANGS OUT
AT THE GALLERIES.

20:29.729 --> 20:30.896
- WHAT ABOUT THE PHONE RECORDS?

20:30.930 --> 20:32.798
- NO, NOTHING YET.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.267
BE NICE IF WE HAD A BODY.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.634
SHE COULD BE ANYWHERE.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.270
- NO, NOT QUITE ANYWHERE.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.338
UM...

20:40.673 --> 20:43.976
UH, ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS HER HOUSE,

20:44.009 --> 20:46.945
AND WE KNOW IT'S NOT THERE.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.980
THIS IS THE PARK
WE CHECKED YESTERDAY.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.317
IT'S NOT THERE.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.051
OH, THAT'S MY HOUSE.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.322
WE CAN ELIMINATE THAT.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.588
- AND THIS OFFICE.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.891
- THAT'S TRUE.
IT'S NOT HERE.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.894
CAPTAIN? IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO ELIMINATE?

21:05.397 --> 21:06.298
- HELLO.

21:06.333 --> 21:10.436
AMANDA CASTLE CALLED 911
SATURDAY MORNING.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.338
THE CALL LASTED EIGHT SECONDS.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.873
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
AND HUNG UP.

21:13.905 --> 21:15.106
- WHERE DID SHE CALL FROM?

21:15.141 --> 21:18.345
- FROM THE GENERAL VICINITY
OF STEVEN DeWITT'S TOWNHOUSE.

21:18.377 --> 21:19.612

21:19.645 --> 21:21.548

WITHIN TEN CITY BLOCKS.

21:21.580 --> 21:24.384
THAT'S THE BEST THEY CAN DO.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.818
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO PROVE
THEY KNEW EACH OTHER.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.388
- OH, IT'S 1:22.
WE REALLY SHOULD GET BACK.

21:29.422 --> 21:30.690
- YOU SAID 2:30.

23:39.719 --> 23:42.689
YOU CAN TELL BY THE MOSS.

23:42.721 --> 23:44.590
THE MOSS GROWS
ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE TREE.

23:44.624 --> 23:45.857
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

23:45.892 --> 23:47.493
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SHADE
ON IT.

23:47.527 --> 23:48.494
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:48.528 --> 23:49.561
WHAT IS THAT,
A RUG?

23:49.596 --> 23:51.197
DON'T TOUCH IT.
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.731
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE IT'S BEEN.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.567
SERIOUSLY, HANDS OFF THE RUG!

25:06.071 --> 25:09.942
DON'T--DON'T--DON'T CRY.

DON'T CRY.

25:11.277 --> 25:12.778
OH, SHE'S HAPPY.

25:12.811 --> 25:15.080
SHE'S ON A FARM
WITH ALL HER FRIENDS.

SHE LOVES IT THERE.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.884
SHE'S...

25:18.917 --> 25:21.153
CHASING RABBITS ALL DAY, AND...

25:22.153 --> 25:24.590
YOU'RE NOT BUYING THAT.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.258
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.729
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW
EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL.

25:29.761 --> 25:32.198
SHH.

25:32.230 --> 25:34.834
NEVER ALONE, LITTLE ONE.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.669
NEVER ALONE.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.306
- I'VE ALREADY TALKED
TO THE POLICE.

25:40.338 --> 25:43.675
I MEAN, THE REAL POLICE.
THEY WERE HERE FOR THREE HOURS.

25:43.710 --> 25:47.012
I DIDN'T KNOW THE GIRL,
I NEVER MET THE GIRL.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.647
- YOU WERE AT HER HOUSE.
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR HER.

25:48.681 --> 25:52.183
- I SAW SHE WAS MISSING.
IT WAS ON THE NEWS.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.853
THEY SAID
THEY NEEDED VOLUNTEERS.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.622
I WAS JUST DOING
MY CIVIC DUTY.

25:55.654 --> 25:56.488
NEXT TIME, I WON'T BOTHER.

25:56.521 --> 25:58.657
- YOU GAVE THE POLICE
A FALSE NAME.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.827
- YES, I HAVE FOUR OR FIVE
UNPAID PARKING TICKETS.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.762
YOU WANT TO ARREST ME FOR THAT,
GO AHEAD.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.632
- SOMETHING SPILL?

26:05.664 --> 26:06.932
- EXCUSE ME?

26:06.965 --> 26:08.634
- THIS PART OF THE FLOOR,

26:08.667 --> 26:11.037
IT ALMOST LOOKS
LIKE IT WAS BLEACHED.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.605
- YEAH, EXCUSE ME,

26:12.638 --> 26:14.641
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH YOU
JUST WANDERING AROUND.

26:14.673 --> 26:16.241
- I'M SURE YOU'RE NOT.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.944
- I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE,
MR. MONK,

26:18.978 --> 26:21.113
AND YOU CAN'T PROVE
THAT I DID.

26:21.146 --> 26:22.213
CAN YOU?

26:22.248 --> 26:24.383
- NO, I CAN'T.

26:24.415 --> 26:25.817

JUST CURIOUS, ABOUT THE RUG.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.201

26:45.371 --> 26:49.842
STEVE BOUGHT IT LAST WEEK
WHILE I WAS IN LONDON.

26:49.875 --> 26:53.078
I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MORE SURPRISED.

26:53.112 --> 26:56.048
IS THIS
ABOUT THAT MISSING GIRL?

26:56.082 --> 26:57.415
THE POOR THING.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.184
I TOLD YOU NOT TO VOLUNTEER.

26:59.218 --> 27:02.387
HE THINKS HE CAN SAVE
THE WORLD SINGLE-HANDEDLY.

27:02.421 --> 27:04.190
I DON'T THINK WE'VE MET.

27:04.222 --> 27:05.223
I'M GWEN.

THEY'RE BORN TAILLESS.
THEY'RE BRED THAT WAY.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.401
- THAT MAKES YOU SPECIAL,
DOESN'T IT?

27:15.433 --> 27:16.367
- CAN I GET YOU FOLKS A DRINK?

27:16.402 --> 27:18.403
- ACTUALLY, THEY WERE
JUST LEAVING, DEAR.

27:18.436 --> 27:21.406

YOUR NAMES.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.275
- THERE'S NO NEED TO.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.777
THEY WON'T BE BACK.

OH, OH, OH, SHE DIDN'T EAT?

27:56.442 --> 27:59.077
- WELL, SHE WASN'T HUNGRY.

27:59.111 --> 28:02.280
- OH, WELL, MAYBE,
WERE YOU WAITING FOR ME?

28:02.314 --> 28:03.481
SHE WAS PROBABLY WAITING
FOR ME.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.116
- I THINK SHE WAS.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.484
- YOUR AUNT NATALIE'S
OUT FRONT, SO...

NOT LIKE DOGS?

29:45.550 --> 29:48.054
- WHAT REASON WOULD ANYBODY
POSSIBLY HAVE?

29:48.086 --> 29:49.888
- I DON'T KNOW.

29:49.922 --> 29:52.490
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S GOT TO
BE CONNECTED TO AMANDA CASTLE.

29:52.523 --> 29:54.259

A WEEK AND A HALF AGO.

THE MURDER.

30:17.548 --> 30:20.019
SHE SAW DeWITT KILL AMANDA,

30:20.051 --> 30:22.087
AND NOW HE'S AFRAID
THAT SHE'LL IDENTIFY HIM.

30:22.121 --> 30:23.890
- HOW?

30:23.923 --> 30:25.423
- SHE COULD BARK AT HIM.

30:25.457 --> 30:28.626
- RANDY, AS FAR AS I KNOW,
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

30:28.660 --> 30:31.630
DOGS ARE NOT ALLOWED
TO TESTIFY IN OPEN COURT.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.598
- WELL, MAYBE DeWITT'S AFRAID
THEY'LL CHANGE THE RULE.

SHE SEEMS TO BE SHIVERING.

31:28.086 --> 31:31.156
- OH, WELL, IS SHE PANTING
HEAVILY AND HEAVING?

31:31.190 --> 31:32.657
- YES. YES.

31:32.691 --> 31:35.426
- UH-HUH. HAS SHE BEEN
PUTTING ON WEIGHT?

31:35.461 --> 31:38.029
- WELL, YES. YES, SHE HAS.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.031
- WELL, IT SOUNDS
LIKE SHE'S WHELPING.

31:40.066 --> 31:41.299
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.969
- WELL, I THINK
SHE'S IN LABOR.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.204
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.638
- SHE'S IN LABOR.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.709
SHE'S HAVING A LITTER,
LITTLE PUPPIES?

31:50.741 --> 31:52.944
BABY PUPPIES.

31:52.979 --> 31:54.113
- YOU MEAN NOW?

31:54.145 --> 31:55.948
- IT SOUNDS LIKE IT.

31:57.482 --> 31:59.651
SIR?

31:59.684 --> 32:02.253
ARE YOU STILL THERE?

32:02.288 --> 32:03.955
CONGRATULATIONS.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.328
- THAT'S A GOOD GIRL.
THAT'S A GOOD GIRL.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.263
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

32:12.298 --> 32:15.366
MR. MONK,
PLEASE BRING ME A TOWEL.

32:15.401 --> 32:16.434
KEEP BREATHING.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.604
- [whines]
- OH, I KNOW IT HURTS.

32:18.636 --> 32:20.205
I'VE BEEN THERE, TOO.

32:24.375 --> 32:25.344
WHERE'D YOU GET THE MASK?

32:25.376 --> 32:27.378
- LEFT TOP DRAWER.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.347
IT'S A NATURAL THING,
MR. MONK.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.083
YOUR MOTHER DID IT, TWICE.

32:31.116 --> 32:32.518
- YOU'RE NOT HELPING AT ALL.

32:32.550 --> 32:34.019
SHE DIDN'T DO IT
IN SOMEBODY'S LIVING ROOM!

32:34.052 --> 32:35.186
- SHH!

32:35.221 --> 32:39.191
- SHE DIDN'T
GO SURPRISING PEOPLE.

32:39.224 --> 32:41.460
WHY--WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
SHE WAS PREGNANT?

32:41.492 --> 32:43.362
- I DIDN'T KNOW.
NOBODY KNEW.

32:43.394 --> 32:46.298
- COME ON, YOU'RE A WOMAN.
HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW?

32:46.332 --> 32:48.567
IT'S A DISASTER.

32:48.599 --> 32:52.770
LITTLE ANIMALS
COMING OUT OF OTHER ANIMALS.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.405
WHAT WAS GOD THINKING?

32:54.440 --> 32:56.307
- OH, IT'S THE MIRACLE OF LIFE.

32:56.342 --> 32:57.375
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.

32:57.409 --> 32:58.676
[Shelby yelps]
- OH!

32:58.710 --> 33:00.679
OKAY, THAT'S
NOT SUCH A BEAUTIFUL THING.

33:00.711 --> 33:01.680
I MEAN, IN GENERAL.

33:01.712 --> 33:02.548
- THIS IS WHAT I GET.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.683
TRYING TO BE NICE,
AND THEY OPEN MY--

33:05.717 --> 33:07.653
- YOUR HEART?
- MY HOUSE!

33:07.685 --> 33:09.221
THEY OPEN MY HOUSE!

33:09.255 --> 33:10.422
- YOU OPENED YOUR HEART,
MR. MONK.

33:10.455 --> 33:12.324
DON'T CLOSE IT NOW.

33:12.357 --> 33:13.159
- [whining]

33:13.192 --> 33:14.726
- OH, HERE IT COMES,
READY OR NOT.

33:14.759 --> 33:16.528
- NO, NO, NOT YET!
I'M NOT READY YET, PLEASE.

33:16.561 --> 33:18.396
NO, JUST TELL HER
TO WAIT. WAIT!

33:18.430 --> 33:20.365
WAIT, TELL HER--
NO. SHELBY, NO!

33:20.398 --> 33:21.633
BAD DOG!

33:21.666 --> 33:23.634
- YOU'RE DOING GOOD, SWEETIE.
KEEP BREATHING.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.304
KEEP BREATHING.
HERE IT COMES.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.605
- WHAT IS THAT?
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

33:26.637 --> 33:28.240
THAT IS--
THAT CANNOT BE RIGHT.

33:28.273 --> 33:31.442
WHOA. THAT--
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

33:31.477 --> 33:35.280
THAT IS NOT RIGHT.
THERE'S NO WAY THAT--

33:45.490 --> 33:47.393
- CONGRATULATIONS, GRANDPA.

33:47.425 --> 33:49.394
- WOW.

33:49.427 --> 33:51.096
- I KNOW.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.531
IT'S A BOY.

33:53.565 --> 33:54.732
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA NAME HIM?

34:00.306 --> 34:01.406
- EXHIBIT "A."

34:01.440 --> 34:04.476
- [laughing]

34:04.509 --> 34:06.444
GOOD GIRL.

34:14.552 --> 34:15.521
- EXHIBIT "A"?

34:15.554 --> 34:18.590
- CHECK OUT THE TAIL.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.592
- WHAT TAIL?
- EXACTLY.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.094
HIS FATHER'S
AN AUSTRALIAN SHEPHERD.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.230
- A TAILLESS
AUSTRALIAN SHEPHERD.

34:24.262 --> 34:25.731
- STEVEN DeWITT.

34:25.764 --> 34:28.500
- HIS WIFE MENTIONED
SHE'D BEEN TRAVELING RECENTLY,

34:28.534 --> 34:29.501
AND HOW LONG WAS SHE GONE?

34:29.534 --> 34:31.103
- ABOUT THREE MONTHS.

34:31.137 --> 34:32.304
- THAT FITS.

34:32.338 --> 34:33.371
WHILE HIS WIFE
WAS OUT OF TOWN,

34:33.405 --> 34:35.106
HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH AMANDA.

34:35.141 --> 34:37.608
- THEY WERE "HOOKING UP,"
YOU UNDERSTAND?

34:37.643 --> 34:38.744
- UH, YEAH.

34:38.777 --> 34:40.346
- AND WHILE
THEY WERE HOOKING UP,

34:40.378 --> 34:42.213
THEIR DOGS
WERE "HOOKING UP."

34:42.248 --> 34:45.451
EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING,
"HOOKING UP."

34:45.483 --> 34:47.585
DO YOU REMEMBER TWO DAYS AGO?

34:47.619 --> 34:50.456
DeWITT SHOWED UP
TO HELP LOOK FOR THE BODY.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.157
HE WAS PETTING SHELBY.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.492
HE WAS PATTING HER BELLY.

34:54.525 --> 34:55.693
- HE NOTICED SHE WAS PREGNANT.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.396
- DeWITT HAD A PROBLEM.

34:57.429 --> 35:00.599
HE KNEW AS SOON AS WE SAW
THESE TAILLESS PUPPIES,

35:00.632 --> 35:02.168
WE'D RUN A DNA TEST.

35:02.201 --> 35:04.436
- WE'D HAVE PROOF,
LIVING PROOF THEIR DOGS HAD MET,

35:04.469 --> 35:05.704
WHICH WOULD PROVE
HE KNEW AMANDA.

35:05.737 --> 35:08.173
- THAT'S WHY HE TRIED
TO RUN HER OVER TONIGHT.

35:08.206 --> 35:10.409
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT
OUR SMOKING GUN.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.878
YOU'RE JUST ABOUT THE CUTEST
LITTLE SMOKING GUN IN HISTORY.

35:12.911 --> 35:15.481
LOOK AT YOU.
- YOU LITTLE DOG.

35:15.514 --> 35:16.715
- THE JURY'S GONNA EAT YOU UP.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.516
[Shelby whining]
- OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

35:18.550 --> 35:19.751
I THINK WE HAVE MORE EVIDENCE.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.887
- EXCUSE ME.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.621
- HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.657
- GOOD GIRL, SHELBY.
GOOD GIRL.

35:39.237 --> 35:43.509
- OKAY, HERE COMES EXHIBIT "A,"
"B," "C," EXHIBIT "D."

35:43.541 --> 35:45.577
- OH, ANOTHER ONE?

35:45.610 --> 35:47.378
WHAT'S THE RECORD?

35:47.413 --> 35:50.815
- MM, I THINK IT'S 101.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.684
- [laughs]
THAT WAS THE MOVIE.

35:53.719 --> 35:54.786
- RIGHT.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.456
- THAT WOMAN AGAIN,
WHO WAS THAT, COUPE DE VILLE?

35:57.489 --> 36:00.759
AH, CRUELLA.
CRUELLA, SHE WAS BAD NEWS.

36:00.791 --> 36:02.661
MONK, THIS IS GOOD SCOTCH.

36:02.693 --> 36:03.594
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS SCOTCH?

36:03.628 --> 36:06.697
- IT WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT
FROM THE MAYOR.

36:06.731 --> 36:08.666
- WELL, THANK THE MAYOR
FOR ME.

36:08.699 --> 36:10.835
- AH, I THINK SHE'S DONE.

36:10.869 --> 36:13.304
- AND SO AM I.

36:13.338 --> 36:14.606
RANDY, YOU BETTER DRIVE.

36:14.639 --> 36:16.641
- WHAT ABOUT DeWITT?

36:16.675 --> 36:18.344
- WE'LL PICK HIM UP.

36:18.376 --> 36:19.945
CALL KRAMER AND HAVE SOMEBODY
GO TO HIS HOUSE,

36:19.978 --> 36:21.313
AND PUT AN A.P.B.
ON HIS VEHICLE.

36:21.347 --> 36:22.313
- YES, SIR.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.914
- WHAT--WHAT DO I DO?

36:23.949 --> 36:25.617
- YOU GET SOME SLEEP.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.385
WE'LL BE BACK TO PICK YOU
AND THE DOGS UP IN THE MORNING.

36:27.418 --> 36:28.519
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

36:28.554 --> 36:30.556
THE PUPPIES,
WHAT DO I DO?

36:30.588 --> 36:32.623
- MR. MONK, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

36:32.657 --> 36:33.858
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

36:33.891 --> 36:36.228
BYE, SHELBY.

36:36.262 --> 36:37.496
GOOD JOB.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.233
- [groans]

36:42.268 --> 36:44.635
- YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPLAINING
TO DO, YOUNG LADY.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.641
[doorknob rattling]

37:13.632 --> 37:15.333
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.503
SHE'S ALREADY HAD THE LITTER.

37:20.706 --> 37:24.409
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, STEVE?

37:24.443 --> 37:25.911
KILL THEM ALL?

37:25.943 --> 37:29.347
I SUPPOSE I AM.

37:29.380 --> 37:32.318
BUT I'M A WITNESS,
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO KILL ME, TOO.

37:32.351 --> 37:33.719
- NO, DON'T--DON'T--
DON'T MOVE.

37:33.751 --> 37:34.885
YOU JUST STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.634
- I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE A KILLER.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.505
I THINK YOU LOVED AMANDA.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.010
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
- I BELIEVE YOU.

37:59.043 --> 38:00.746
- SHE FELL
AND HIT HER HEAD.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.947
- THAT'S NOT MURDER.

38:02.981 --> 38:06.684
IT'S MANSLAUGHTER,
MAYBE OBSTRUCTION.

38:06.717 --> 38:09.755
THAT'S BAD,
BUT IT COULD BE A LOT WORSE.

38:11.822 --> 38:13.791
DON'T MAKE IT WORSE.

38:18.829 --> 38:20.731
DON'T MAKE IT WORSE.

38:26.505 --> 38:29.375
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
- I KNOW.

38:29.407 --> 38:32.744
I KNOW IT WAS.

38:44.623 --> 38:45.891
- THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.500
- I KNOW.

39:03.141 --> 39:05.443
- I'LL TAKE THAT ONE.
- OKAY.

39:07.413 --> 39:08.480
- OOH.

39:12.583 --> 39:13.552
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

39:13.585 --> 39:15.786
- UH, EXHIBIT "B,"

39:15.820 --> 39:17.655
BUT YOU CAN CALL HIM
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

39:17.688 --> 39:18.789
- ALL RIGHT.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.659
- SAY THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.427
- WE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM,
WE PROMISE.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.461
- OKAY.

39:24.862 --> 39:28.699
- WAIT. WAIT.
UH, I CAN'T DO THIS.

39:28.733 --> 39:30.568
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T SPLIT THEM UP.

39:30.601 --> 39:32.137
THEY HAVE TO STAY TOGETHER.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.773
- MR. MONK,
I KNOW IT HURTS,

39:34.806 --> 39:36.942
AND I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT YOUR OWN FAMILY.

39:36.974 --> 39:39.545
WITH DOGS, IT'S DIFFERENT.

39:39.577 --> 39:41.012
- IT'S NOT DIFFERENT.
THEY'RE A FAMILY,

39:41.045 --> 39:42.614
SHE'S THE MOTHER,
THEY HAVE TO BE TOGETHER.

39:42.648 --> 39:44.882
- HERE'S THE THING.
THERE ARE FIVE DOGS HERE.

39:44.916 --> 39:48.487
YOU CAN'T KEEP THEM ALL.
YOU'RE...YOU KNOW.

39:48.519 --> 39:49.655
YOU'RE YOU.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.121
- I KNOW, I KNOW, I'M ME.

39:51.155 --> 39:52.923
- HOW ABOUT THIS?

39:52.958 --> 39:54.860
WE'LL TAKE ALL OF THEM.
- REALLY?

39:54.893 --> 39:56.862
- THE WHOLE FAMILY...

39:56.894 --> 39:58.829
INCLUDING THE MOM.

39:58.864 --> 40:01.567
WE HAVE THREE ACRES,
IT'S ALL FENCED IN.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.969
THEY'LL LOVE IT.

40:04.001 --> 40:05.135
- OKAY.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.938
- HEY, GREAT,
I'LL GET HER THINGS.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.139
ANNE MARIE,
YOU WANT TO HELP?

40:08.172 --> 40:10.576
- YEAH.
- OKAY?

40:14.179 --> 40:15.947
- YOU CAN VISIT HER
ANYTIME.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.548
- UH, HOW ABOUT 2:00?

40:17.583 --> 40:19.550
- OKAY, 2:00.

40:19.585 --> 40:20.952
YOU MEAN, TOMORROW?

40:20.985 --> 40:22.688
- EVERY DAY.
- [laughs] EVERY DAY?

40:24.922 --> 40:27.025
OKAY.

40:27.057 --> 40:28.994
I'LL GO GET HER LEASH.

40:33.565 --> 40:34.733
IT'S OKAY.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.235
I KNOW THEM.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.737
THEY'RE A GOOD FAMILY.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.907
YOU'LL BE HAPPY THERE.

40:45.242 --> 40:47.211
NEVER ALONE, LITTLE ONE.

40:48.780 --> 40:52.050
NEVER ALONE AGAIN.

41:23.280 --> 41:27.485
