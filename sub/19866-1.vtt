00:09.572 --> 00:12.810
My name is John Northwood.

00:14.147 --> 00:16.810
And this is a story of a girl,

00:17.418 --> 00:19.712
and her gift,

00:19.722 --> 00:22.016
a gift that shook the world.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.158
Police have reported the disappearance

01:09.170 --> 01:12.205
of a missing
three-year-old girl in York.

01:12.208 --> 01:17.216
The news came when neighbors described
hearing two gunshots from next door.

01:17.217 --> 01:20.387
Police are still searching
for the missing girl's parents

01:20.389 --> 01:22.243
who've also disappeared.

01:24.997 --> 01:29.035
Two bodies were found in a lake on
the outskirts of York this morning

01:29.036 --> 01:31.195
around 10 a.m.

01:31.207 --> 01:34.174
They're believed to be the parents
of the missing three-year-old

01:34.179 --> 01:37.850
who vanished suddenly from
her home a fortnight ago.

01:37.851 --> 01:41.223
Police are continuing
the search for her whereabouts.

01:44.962 --> 01:49.536
Today marks the 20th anniversary
of the York Angel,

01:49.537 --> 01:53.543
whose family was tragically
murdered in 1992.

01:53.544 --> 01:57.449
The world still asks the
question if she is still alive.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.788
And if so, where is she now?

02:25.964 --> 02:29.302

Sir.

03:50.103 --> 03:52.260
The gentleman's here to see you.

03:52.272 --> 03:55.274
Ah. Send him in, will you?

04:02.689 --> 04:04.680
Your staff seems a little bit
on edge, eh, Raven?

04:04.693 --> 04:08.200
Well, what with today's events,
they have every reason to be.

04:09.467 --> 04:11.423
Please, take a seat.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.540
So, tell me...

04:22.556 --> 04:23.938
Why does a wealthy man,

04:23.958 --> 04:27.629
who owns one of the most profitable
private hospitals in the country,

04:27.630 --> 04:29.350
want with a man like me?

04:29.367 --> 04:32.435
I need you to locate someone for me.

04:34.108 --> 04:38.181
And I want you
to bring her back unharmed.

04:38.182 --> 04:41.014
You know my services don't come cheap?

04:41.019 --> 04:43.516
I'm quite aware of your reputation, Max.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.157
And your methods.

04:47.163 --> 04:49.659
You're a nasty piece of work, Max.

04:50.602 --> 04:53.097
But you're exactly what I need.

04:55.410 --> 04:57.163
Okay, then.

04:57.179 --> 04:58.461
Tell me about her.

05:00.585 --> 05:02.170
Her name is Kyra.

05:03.624 --> 05:07.128
She's a mentally disturbed
patient of mine

05:07.129 --> 05:09.321
and she needs special attention

05:09.333 --> 05:12.132
due to her abilities.

05:12.138 --> 05:16.076
As a child, she had
incredible psychic skills.

05:16.077 --> 05:19.112
She could move small toys
without touching them.

05:20.184 --> 05:22.612
I experimented on her mind.

05:26.227 --> 05:29.026
As Kyra grew, so did her abilities.

05:29.733 --> 05:32.161
But she became unstable.

05:32.171 --> 05:35.070
She began to fail
the psychic tests on purpose.

05:36.110 --> 05:39.347
So we had to take drastic steps,

05:39.348 --> 05:42.485
injecting her with drugs
which suppressed her mind

05:42.488 --> 05:45.118
and allowed us to keep her
under control.

05:46.494 --> 05:49.327
Of course, there were side effects.

05:49.332 --> 05:52.536
The drugs affected her mind
and she began to hallucinate.

05:52.537 --> 05:57.411
She spoke of terrible visions
of death and destruction.

05:57.412 --> 06:00.211
Kyra believed that the world
was coming to an end.

06:00.818 --> 06:04.289
Her mind was fractured.

06:04.290 --> 06:09.431
But needless to say, she's the
most dangerous girl on Earth.

06:09.432 --> 06:11.826
She is not my flesh and blood,

06:12.670 --> 06:15.503
but she is my property.

06:15.508 --> 06:19.251
She could bring down a helicopter
in a matter of seconds.

06:20.183 --> 06:21.329
If she wished.

06:22.554 --> 06:24.812
Is that why you wanted her back so soon?

06:26.927 --> 06:29.557
I think I might have to double my price.

06:29.565 --> 06:33.203
She was aided by this man, Randall.

06:33.204 --> 06:34.486
I believe you know him.

06:34.506 --> 06:35.586
Yeah, I know him.

06:35.608 --> 06:37.429
He's my old mentor.

06:37.444 --> 06:39.704
Trained me and a few other assassins.

06:39.715 --> 06:41.705
Till I decided to work for myself.

06:41.718 --> 06:45.523
Somehow, he discovered everything
about Kyra and the experiments,

06:45.524 --> 06:48.458
which in the eyes of others
would be classed as

06:48.462 --> 06:51.430
illegal and a crime against humanity.

06:53.304 --> 06:54.754
She could be anywhere right now.

06:54.773 --> 06:58.712
Well, fortunately, Randall
commandeered one of my vehicles

06:58.713 --> 07:01.714
and they're all fitted
with a GPS tracker.

07:01.718 --> 07:04.517
I'll provide you with
anything you require.

07:08.429 --> 07:11.464
I need two vehicles.
One jeep and one van.

07:11.467 --> 07:12.917
And a group of your best men.

07:14.539 --> 07:17.304
If this Kyra's as dangerous
as you say she is,

07:17.310 --> 07:20.345
then we need to be prepared
for whatever she throws at us.

07:21.951 --> 07:23.536
I'll see to it.

07:26.559 --> 07:28.447
Oh, and, Max,

07:28.462 --> 07:31.261
if you see Randall on your troubles,

07:31.267 --> 07:34.638
I'll handsomely reward you for his head.

07:35.740 --> 07:38.269
Raven, I'll gladly do it for free.

08:12.968 --> 08:14.688
Keep running, Kyra.

08:17.609 --> 08:19.666
Now the hallway should be clear. Go.

08:23.519 --> 08:26.048
When you get to the end, there
should be an elevator on your left.

08:27.793 --> 08:29.985
Take it down to the car park
and I'll meet you there.

08:30.965 --> 08:32.313
Why are you helping me?

08:32.332 --> 08:35.672
My name is Randall.
I'm here to get you out.

08:35.673 --> 08:38.538
We need to get you to safety, Kyra.

08:38.544 --> 08:41.047
I'll be sending you to a friend
called John Northwood.

08:41.049 --> 08:43.083
He'll be able to help you.

08:43.085 --> 08:45.816
Don't worry, Kyra.
Everything will be all right.

10:56.871 --> 10:58.018
Excuse me.

11:00.043 --> 11:02.573
Do you know a John Northwood?

11:04.183 --> 11:05.263
Who?

11:05.285 --> 11:06.938
John Northwood?

11:06.955 --> 11:08.303
I was told he'd be here.

11:09.091 --> 11:10.576
Never heard of him.

11:47.021 --> 11:48.134
I heard you've been looking for me.

11:50.359 --> 11:51.641
Who sent you?

11:52.463 --> 11:53.677
Randall.

11:56.136 --> 11:57.383
Follow me.

12:04.750 --> 12:06.841
Apologize for the cloak and dagger.

12:06.853 --> 12:09.147
A lot of people
are still looking for me.

12:09.157 --> 12:10.945
All for different reasons.

12:11.494 --> 12:13.181
Please, take a seat.

12:19.241 --> 12:20.421
So what's your name?

12:21.144 --> 12:22.189
Kyra.

12:22.212 --> 12:23.325
Just "Kyra"?

12:24.449 --> 12:25.798
Yes.

12:25.818 --> 12:27.268
Fine.

12:27.287 --> 12:29.783
How well do you know Randall?

12:29.791 --> 12:32.219
Not that well.
I'd never seen him till today.

12:32.997 --> 12:35.761
Well, tell me your story.

12:36.903 --> 12:39.197
I'm all ears.

12:39.207 --> 12:41.971
If never been able
to recall my memories well.

12:43.246 --> 12:45.540
I've always had trouble.

12:45.550 --> 12:48.249
Randall helped me escape the hospital.

12:48.255 --> 12:50.413
I've never left before.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.854
He said I'd die if he didn't.

12:55.801 --> 12:58.498
None of this makes any sense to me.

12:58.506 --> 13:01.540
Raven has taken care of me
since I was a child.

13:02.445 --> 13:04.299
And now there's men after me.

13:04.315 --> 13:06.169
Chuffin' hell fire.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.208
- The thing is, Tyra...
- Kyra.

13:09.223 --> 13:13.162
Whatever. You're not the first
person to come looking for my help.

13:13.163 --> 13:15.287
Randall used to do it all the time.

13:15.299 --> 13:17.221
Whenever he thought
there was gonna be trouble,

13:17.236 --> 13:21.475
he's say, "Go find John,
Go find John. He'll help you."

13:21.476 --> 13:23.398
He always used to get me into his shit.

13:24.114 --> 13:25.497
What's your point?

13:25.516 --> 13:26.798
I'm old.

13:27.854 --> 13:30.315
If you'd walked through
my door ten years ago,

13:30.324 --> 13:32.044
I might've been able to help.

13:34.097 --> 13:37.266
But you're a decade too late.
I don't protect people anymore.

13:38.972 --> 13:41.467
All the answers are on here.

13:41.476 --> 13:43.263
He said you should look at it.

13:43.279 --> 13:44.526
It'll explain everything.

13:44.547 --> 13:47.009
I'm done, Kyra.

13:47.018 --> 13:49.616
Can't be involved in this shit again.

13:49.623 --> 13:52.960
I've got a friend who
might be able to help.

13:52.961 --> 13:55.221
The best thing for you to do now
is go wait for Randall in the bar

13:56.033 --> 13:57.381
and be on your way.

14:37.068 --> 14:38.821
No doubt you've already met Kyra

14:38.837 --> 14:41.299
and tried to figure out
what I've got you into now.

14:42.678 --> 14:44.464
Well,

14:44.481 --> 14:48.386
over the past year, I've been trying
to infiltrate a man called Raven

14:48.387 --> 14:50.983
and his secret organization.

14:50.991 --> 14:54.830
He portrays himself
as a private hospital owner,

14:54.831 --> 14:59.137
but that's just a smokescreen to
hide all his illegal activities.

14:59.138 --> 15:03.243
For nearly 20 years, he's performed
so many unforgivable tests on Kyra

15:03.244 --> 15:05.200
to enhance her abilities,

15:05.215 --> 15:08.080
I don't know
what she's fully capable of.

15:08.085 --> 15:11.019
But I know
that she needs to be protected.

15:11.024 --> 15:13.890
She cannot return to Raven.

15:13.895 --> 15:15.784
If she's captured again,

15:15.798 --> 15:19.303
an innocent life will be lost.

15:19.304 --> 15:22.171
Now, I bet you're wondering
why you should even care.

15:22.176 --> 15:24.907
And I know you gave up
this life a long time ago.

15:26.416 --> 15:29.787
And we didn't part on very good terms,

15:29.788 --> 15:33.058
but I had no one else to turn to.

15:33.060 --> 15:36.264
Kyra's been dealt
a cruel hand in her life.

15:36.266 --> 15:39.772
Please help her to start a new one.

15:39.772 --> 15:44.111
By doing this, I know
I endangered myself.

15:44.112 --> 15:47.215
This will probably be the last
message I'll send to anyone.

15:49.020 --> 15:50.469
Well,

15:50.489 --> 15:51.871
I...

15:51.891 --> 15:53.982
I just wanted you to know, John,

15:53.995 --> 15:58.434
that you were my best student,
and I'm very proud of you.

15:58.435 --> 16:01.033
And I know you'll make the right choice.

16:03.811 --> 16:05.193
Goodbye.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.169
Move in.

17:07.950 --> 17:09.265
Hands up, civilian.

18:17.431 --> 18:18.577
Let's go.

18:28.382 --> 18:29.730
John Northwood.

18:35.327 --> 18:36.743
Get inside.

18:36.763 --> 18:38.246
Now!

18:38.265 --> 18:39.547
Fire!

19:12.355 --> 19:13.569
John?

19:14.458 --> 19:15.841
Still alive?

19:17.463 --> 19:19.183
I wanna make a deal with you.

19:22.304 --> 19:23.518
Give us the girl.

19:24.307 --> 19:26.162
And I promise.

19:27.913 --> 19:30.240
You won't come to any more harm.

19:40.868 --> 19:42.824
Unless you wanna beg for your life.

19:43.739 --> 19:45.392
Like that coward, Randall.

19:58.397 --> 20:01.499
I need one of you to go in
there now and take him out!

20:30.917 --> 20:32.502
Report.

20:32.520 --> 20:34.307
Target down.

20:35.925 --> 20:38.083
And the girl?

20:38.095 --> 20:39.916
Bringing her out now.

20:39.931 --> 20:41.213
Good.

21:18.328 --> 21:20.351
Goodbye, John.

21:32.517 --> 21:33.563
Don't shoot!

21:33.586 --> 21:35.137
Repeat, don't shoot!

22:13.051 --> 22:14.333
Well done, John!

22:15.989 --> 22:17.069
Well done.

22:23.535 --> 22:26.221
Nobody's following us.
I think we lost them.

22:39.362 --> 22:40.643
Thank you.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.917
It's all right.

22:45.037 --> 22:46.685
No, really.

22:48.477 --> 22:52.182
You could've just left me
to die back there.

22:52.183 --> 22:55.082
But you didn't, so, thanks.

22:57.057 --> 22:59.047
Have you got that bit of paper
I gave you earlier?

23:03.067 --> 23:04.281
Ta.

23:04.303 --> 23:06.124
Have you got your seat belt on?

23:17.825 --> 23:19.780
Target's name is John Northwood.

23:20.930 --> 23:24.200
Him and I trained together
with the same mentor.

23:24.969 --> 23:26.487
Tell me about him.

23:26.505 --> 23:27.921
He's highly intelligent.

23:27.941 --> 23:29.896
Trained in hand to hand combat.

23:30.646 --> 23:32.467
And crack shot with a gun.

23:32.482 --> 23:35.011
Leave no room for mistakes
on this one, Max.

23:35.019 --> 23:37.683
You know how important
it is to get Kyra back.

23:37.690 --> 23:41.696
Let's hope this John Northwood
can be taken care of.

23:41.697 --> 23:44.259
I'm better. I'll find him.

23:44.802 --> 23:46.522
And I'll kill him.

23:46.538 --> 23:48.561
See that you do.

23:48.575 --> 23:50.969
Prove to me that you're as good
as you say you are.

24:16.687 --> 24:18.407
Is this the place?

24:23.966 --> 24:25.552
You wait here.

24:43.566 --> 24:44.914
Got you now, pal!

24:54.083 --> 24:57.554
John! Thought you were a burglar.
I could've killed you!

24:57.555 --> 24:59.039
Good job you didn't.

24:59.057 --> 25:00.575
Good to see you, man.

25:00.594 --> 25:01.707
Yeah, you too.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.845
Years of bounty hunting and this
is what he does in his spare time.

25:14.583 --> 25:15.999
I like them.

25:17.822 --> 25:19.609
I really like them.

25:19.625 --> 25:21.074
Just thought I'd give drawing a go.

25:21.094 --> 25:22.712
Nah, we've got no time for this.

25:22.730 --> 25:23.775
Just a quick one.

25:23.798 --> 25:24.878
What is it?

25:24.900 --> 25:26.856
Just taste. Cheers.

25:33.147 --> 25:35.608
Ah, that hit the spot. So tell me,

25:35.617 --> 25:38.788
what's a gorgeous girl like you
doing with this fella here?

25:38.790 --> 25:40.441
Billy, I need to tell you something.

25:41.494 --> 25:42.675
It's about Randall.

25:43.464 --> 25:45.217
He died a few days ago.

25:45.233 --> 25:46.852
Oh, God, no.

25:46.870 --> 25:48.792
That's why we're here.

25:48.806 --> 25:49.987
We need your help.

25:51.711 --> 25:53.094
What do you need from me, exactly?

25:53.113 --> 25:56.986
Kyra's being hunted by a man
called Raven and his mercenaries.

25:56.987 --> 25:59.549
We're not quite sure
about their intentions.

25:59.557 --> 26:01.614
But Kyra believes we need
to head to the North.

26:04.966 --> 26:08.571
It's very important that
we find it before they do.

26:08.572 --> 26:11.641
John tells me you know the
North better than anyone.

26:11.644 --> 26:13.768
I don't know what to say.
You're both nuts!

26:13.780 --> 26:15.028
Billy, we're serious.

26:15.049 --> 26:17.713
No, no, no. You expect
me to believe this?

26:17.721 --> 26:19.811
Kyra, I've just met you.
You're a lovely girl,

26:19.824 --> 26:22.556
but, John, are you on something?
We can get you some help.

26:22.562 --> 26:24.517
We're being honest, Billy.

26:24.532 --> 26:26.724
Randall risked his life to save Kyra

26:26.736 --> 26:28.185
and he died doing it.

26:28.204 --> 26:30.025
He wouldn't have done that for nothing.

26:30.041 --> 26:31.895
We both know that.

26:31.910 --> 26:33.496
They want to use her for her powers.

26:34.849 --> 26:37.006
Go on, then. Go on, then. Prove it.

26:40.591 --> 26:41.570
Fine.

26:43.096 --> 26:45.658
He wants a demonstration,
I'll give him one.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.583
What a load of pish!

27:06.601 --> 27:09.029
I've heard some crap but you...

27:13.112 --> 27:15.742
Holy shit! How did you do that?

27:15.749 --> 27:19.321
I'm still learning. I guess I
can only do it when I'm angry.

27:19.322 --> 27:21.311
So you can do more
than just move things?

27:22.027 --> 27:23.172
Maybe.

27:24.330 --> 27:26.151
I need your help, Billy.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.089
We need your help.

27:28.103 --> 27:31.003
Me and you together, side
by side like the old days.

27:31.007 --> 27:32.626
You know I would, pal.

27:32.644 --> 27:34.937
But I'm a family man.

27:34.948 --> 27:37.038
My daughter's turning ten soon.

27:37.051 --> 27:38.905
And she needs her dad.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.674
It's not that I don't want to help.

27:40.690 --> 27:42.747
I've got some gear upstairs. A map,

27:42.761 --> 27:45.660
some hunting gear.
You're welcome to take that.

27:45.666 --> 27:49.270
Thanks very much. Let's get
this stuff in the car.

27:49.271 --> 27:51.665
You better hurry and tidy up
before your wife gets back.

27:51.675 --> 27:54.946
Ha! And she's gonna do her a nut.
Do me a favor though.

27:54.947 --> 27:58.252
If you find the prick who killed
Randall, give him one from me.

27:58.252 --> 28:01.052
I will. Don't worry, Billy.

28:01.057 --> 28:02.979
Right. I'll go and get the stuff.

28:11.474 --> 28:13.026
I have got one question.

28:13.044 --> 28:17.216
What's so important about
this building in the North?

28:17.217 --> 28:20.892
I don't know why, but I think my
visions are trying to tell me something.

28:37.784 --> 28:40.212
I'm scared, John. I don't know
what we're going to find.

28:42.861 --> 28:46.194
Well, whatever's waiting for us,
we'll be ready for them.

29:44.361 --> 29:46.249
There's a building close by.

29:47.499 --> 29:49.050
Kyra?

29:50.003 --> 29:51.116
Kyra!

29:53.041 --> 29:54.997
You're supposed to stick by me.

30:02.357 --> 30:06.156
This is it, John. This is
where I was supposed to come.

30:08.334 --> 30:11.065
Be on your guard. Come on.

30:42.290 --> 30:44.042
Can you remember anything?

30:44.526 --> 30:46.280
From your visions.

30:46.296 --> 30:48.893
It's hard to describe.

30:48.900 --> 30:51.126
I feel like I've been here before.

30:59.518 --> 31:01.271
I can see myself.

31:03.257 --> 31:05.213
But it doesn't feel real.

31:07.398 --> 31:09.488
Kyra, there's nothing here.

31:10.536 --> 31:13.032
I've been thinking...

31:13.040 --> 31:15.132
These images might not be
what they seem.

31:18.249 --> 31:19.496
I know it makes no sense, but...

31:19.518 --> 31:21.068
Quiet.

31:21.922 --> 31:23.237
Get behind me.

31:39.584 --> 31:42.652
You know what? I thought this was
going to be a lot more difficult.

31:44.259 --> 31:46.922
Seems age has finally
caught up with you, John.

31:48.198 --> 31:51.570
And here he is!
The great John Northwood.

31:53.106 --> 31:55.400
And his little sidekick.

31:55.410 --> 31:57.567
She's more loyal than you, Max.

31:57.580 --> 32:00.177
You betrayed everything we stood for.

32:00.185 --> 32:02.039
Randall trained us to be the best

32:02.054 --> 32:04.684
and you murdered him in cold blood.

32:04.692 --> 32:06.647
You know what, Kyra?

32:06.661 --> 32:08.516
Raven wanted me
to bring you back unharmed.

32:11.069 --> 32:12.452
But I can't say the same for him!

32:14.441 --> 32:16.060
You're gonna shoot, John?

32:17.146 --> 32:18.494
Eh?

32:18.515 --> 32:20.100
Still got the nerve?

32:21.286 --> 32:22.568
Well, I'm the best!

32:32.738 --> 32:34.357
Well, don't just stand there, then!

32:45.392 --> 32:46.472
Get them!

33:16.644 --> 33:18.229
Main target is hit.

33:23.622 --> 33:25.308
Whoo! Isn't this fun?

33:25.325 --> 33:27.112
You need to get out of here.
No, I'm not leaving you.

33:28.430 --> 33:30.486
Go now. Go. Go!

34:17.311 --> 34:18.489
No!

34:38.978 --> 34:40.565
Be careful, boys.

34:41.717 --> 34:43.538
She's not your average kind of girl.

35:07.994 --> 35:09.781
Sir, she's fighting back.

35:46.057 --> 35:47.607
Keep moving, men.

37:44.484 --> 37:45.731
So,

37:45.753 --> 37:50.092
you're the man who's been
causing me all this grief, eh?

37:50.093 --> 37:53.465
I must say, you don't look much
like a bounty hunter to me.

37:57.072 --> 37:58.488
Where's Kyra?

37:59.976 --> 38:03.447
In isolation. Away from you.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.248
I know everything about you, John.

38:06.253 --> 38:08.580
I know that Randall
took you in as a child

38:08.591 --> 38:11.423
when your family perished
in a house fire.

38:11.428 --> 38:13.654
He trained you to become
a bounty hunter.

38:14.734 --> 38:16.522
Just like him.

38:16.537 --> 38:18.560
I don't need a history lesson.

38:20.376 --> 38:22.670
I have a question for you, John.

38:22.680 --> 38:26.419
Why does a man with
such skills as you have

38:26.420 --> 38:29.185
land yourself in a mess like this?

38:29.191 --> 38:31.282
This mess is something you began.

38:31.294 --> 38:33.183
You're the one to blame.

38:35.601 --> 38:37.693
But I believe there are a few
things that you should know

38:37.705 --> 38:43.413
before I let our mutual friend,
Max, take care of you.

38:43.414 --> 38:46.078
Kyra has always been gifted,

38:46.085 --> 38:48.749
ever since she was young.

38:48.757 --> 38:52.264
Unfortunately, her parents
didn't think the same way.

38:52.830 --> 38:55.292
So I...

38:55.301 --> 38:57.223
Did what I had to do.

38:58.773 --> 39:02.444
We conducted tests on her
every single day.

39:02.445 --> 39:05.379
And her abilities improved.

39:06.586 --> 39:09.081
Kyra was a miracle.

39:10.659 --> 39:13.222
She was, the miracle.

39:14.665 --> 39:19.139
But over the past few years,
Kyra became unstable.

39:19.140 --> 39:23.313
She began to disobey orders and
accidents became more frequent.

39:23.314 --> 39:28.454
The more enraged she becomes,
the more powerful she can be.

39:28.455 --> 39:33.495
So as a precaution we used drugs
to regain control of her mind.

39:33.496 --> 39:37.202
And it worked for a while.

39:37.203 --> 39:40.306
So we decided the best way
to keep her mind confused

39:40.308 --> 39:43.411
was the use of fabricated memories.

39:43.413 --> 39:46.482
A series of images repeated on a loop.

39:46.485 --> 39:49.654
Images she could relate to.

39:49.657 --> 39:52.658
The key image was the
structure in the forest.

39:53.897 --> 39:57.369
We knew that if she ever did escape,

39:57.370 --> 40:01.214
she would find her way there and
we would be ready for extraction.

40:08.188 --> 40:11.425
The only thing I didn't
count on was you.

40:12.461 --> 40:15.530
Kyra is a threat to the world.

40:15.533 --> 40:19.243
And you've been protecting her
all this time.

40:20.741 --> 40:22.191
She was afraid.

40:23.446 --> 40:26.448
I did what I had to do to protect her.

40:26.451 --> 40:29.316
And let me tell you right now,
I am her protector.

40:30.457 --> 40:32.953
And I'll do anything to make her safe.

40:32.961 --> 40:35.490
I'm afraid it's too late for that.

40:37.903 --> 40:41.680
The time has come
to set everything right.

40:42.644 --> 40:44.229
What are you gonna do?

40:46.651 --> 40:48.640
Correct my mistake.

41:21.374 --> 41:22.993
Begin the procedure.

42:11.757 --> 42:12.870
What the hell?

42:16.599 --> 42:18.487
The patient's escaping, sir.

42:23.944 --> 42:25.765
Bring her down!

42:25.780 --> 42:27.872
Bring her down, you imbeciles!

42:27.884 --> 42:30.750
You hear me? Bring her down!

42:43.810 --> 42:45.395
Down here.

43:07.215 --> 43:10.048
Sir, the patient...

43:12.257 --> 43:14.045
She's gone.

43:17.700 --> 43:19.992
Repeat, the patient has gone.

43:28.751 --> 43:30.605
Go ahead, John!

43:30.621 --> 43:31.969
Pull the trigger.

43:33.692 --> 43:35.986
Do it.

43:35.996 --> 43:38.255
Killing me won't do you any good, John.

43:39.769 --> 43:41.152
You got what you wanted.

43:41.940 --> 43:43.591
You got your miracle.

43:44.644 --> 43:48.850
Look, I need you, and I need you both.

43:48.851 --> 43:51.987
To stop Kyra from killing anyone else.

44:07.715 --> 44:10.717
We're following her path on the GPS.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.710
She's heading for the Scottish border.

44:14.025 --> 44:15.677
Where would she go?

44:18.065 --> 44:20.224
Somewhere where she's been before.

44:21.337 --> 44:23.968
Somewhere with a high population.

44:25.644 --> 44:27.364
A city, most likely.

44:27.380 --> 44:29.674
Nah, city's too big.

44:34.326 --> 44:35.977
Get your helicopter ready.

44:36.963 --> 44:38.210
Where are we going?

44:38.833 --> 44:39.878
Gretna.

46:08.246 --> 46:11.281
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
On behalf of Karl and Aliscia,

46:11.285 --> 46:15.524
I'd like to welcome to this, their
wedding day, here at Anvil Hall.

46:15.525 --> 46:18.863
I'm sure they'll join with me in wishing
them every happiness and success

46:18.864 --> 46:21.326
as they begin their married
life together today.

46:46.443 --> 46:51.316
So, Karl and Aliscia, I now
pronounce you husband and wife.

46:51.317 --> 46:52.903
You may kiss the bride.

48:02.334 --> 48:04.122
You two, come with me.

48:21.065 --> 48:22.549
John!

48:22.568 --> 48:24.726
What's going on down there?

48:24.738 --> 48:28.143
We're under attack.
Kyra's created these monsters.

48:28.144 --> 48:30.336
Billy's with me, but we need help.

48:30.347 --> 48:32.540
We can't let these things
leave this church.

48:32.551 --> 48:34.137
We're outnumbered.

48:34.154 --> 48:36.043
Max! Max!

48:37.091 --> 48:38.340
Send our weapons down!

48:50.213 --> 48:51.731
I've got the package.

48:53.352 --> 48:55.004
Good luck, John.

49:53.652 --> 49:55.236
Excuse me.

49:57.391 --> 49:59.144
No one leaves my service

50:00.295 --> 50:01.578
until I say so.

51:44.801 --> 51:48.679
Just go. I'll be fine. I'm gonna
take care of the rest of these guys.

51:50.544 --> 51:52.701
Guys, we got a problem. Kyra's not here.

51:52.714 --> 51:53.894
Those things are heading to town.

51:53.916 --> 51:55.838
We've got to get to town quick.

51:56.620 --> 51:57.935
Get moving, John.

51:59.258 --> 52:02.394
What's going on? The road's
been blocked by these things.

52:02.396 --> 52:04.554
We need to get to town, fast.

52:04.567 --> 52:06.522
We can't go that way. It's blocked.

52:09.475 --> 52:11.532
Looks like that way's blocked too.

52:11.545 --> 52:13.366
We'll have to try and
make it round that way now!

53:10.776 --> 53:13.103
Aaron, clean up on aisle two.

53:22.596 --> 53:23.674
Aaron?

53:25.066 --> 53:26.449
Aaron!

54:30.007 --> 54:31.051
You all right?

54:31.074 --> 54:32.322
Yeah, thanks for that.

54:33.178 --> 54:35.606
Here, can you handle a gun?

54:35.616 --> 54:36.897
I don't know.

54:41.892 --> 54:43.342
But I've never shot anybody before.

54:43.362 --> 54:46.093
There's a first time for
everything. Come on, let's go.

54:48.703 --> 54:50.255
Come on.

54:55.749 --> 54:56.963
Good job.

55:00.222 --> 55:02.853
Raven, I've got a man on the ground.

55:02.861 --> 55:04.985
But I'm still searching for Kyra.

56:46.531 --> 56:48.925
Maurice, it's not a premier package.

57:53.307 --> 57:54.926
There you are.

57:58.650 --> 58:01.280
Shoot her! Shoot her!

58:02.522 --> 58:04.276
Take the bloody shot!

01:01:41.483 --> 01:01:42.866
Stop right there, Kyra.

01:01:45.456 --> 01:01:47.042
Isn't this what you wanted?

01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:51.088
Was I too strong?

01:01:51.099 --> 01:01:53.628
Too powerful beyond your control?

01:01:58.044 --> 01:02:00.438
Were you afraid of me?

01:02:00.448 --> 01:02:02.370
Afraid of what I might do?

01:03:08.193 --> 01:03:10.418
I'm not done yet, old man.

01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:38.759
That one's for Randall.

01:04:31.129 --> 01:04:32.073
Kyra!

01:04:32.098 --> 01:04:34.930
Don't stand in my way.
I need to do this.

01:04:34.936 --> 01:04:36.183
No, you don't.

01:04:37.339 --> 01:04:39.059
He took everything from me.

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:41.133
Everything I had in this world!

01:04:41.146 --> 01:04:43.338
You have no idea what that feels like!

01:04:44.919 --> 01:04:47.009
More than you know, Kyra.

01:04:47.022 --> 01:04:48.708
You don't know the life I've lived.

01:04:50.128 --> 01:04:54.039
I was in a dark, miserable
existence before you arrived.

01:04:57.272 --> 01:04:58.959
You saved me.

01:05:00.244 --> 01:05:01.997
Let me help you.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.280
Don't need to run away anymore,

01:05:08.290 --> 01:05:10.314
you can start a new life.

01:05:10.327 --> 01:05:12.654
I can be the father you never had.

01:05:43.215 --> 01:05:44.698
Kyra!

01:05:58.273 --> 01:05:59.823
I'm sorry, John.

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:10.680
John? I'm sorry.

01:08:10.691 --> 01:08:12.074
John, I'm so sorry.

01:08:12.093 --> 01:08:14.048
It's fine, it's fine. We can fix this.

01:08:14.063 --> 01:08:15.344
No, no, no!

01:08:18.303 --> 01:08:19.720
John...

01:08:19.738 --> 01:08:22.336
if you truly care about me,

01:08:23.178 --> 01:08:25.167
you have to let me go.

01:08:35.098 --> 01:08:37.020
Will you stay with me?

01:08:38.169 --> 01:08:39.990
I don't wanna be alone.

01:11:06.581 --> 01:11:07.693
Hey, Billy. How's it going, mate?

01:11:07.716 --> 01:11:10.212
Hey, pal. Just thought
to check up on you.

01:11:10.821 --> 01:11:12.305
If just been thinking,

01:11:12.323 --> 01:11:14.346
I'm thinking of continuing
Randall's work.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.619
There's people out there
who need to be protected.

01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:19.159
I'm starting a new league
of bounty hunters.

01:11:19.168 --> 01:11:20.820
Ah, well. If you think that's best.

01:11:20.837 --> 01:11:24.176
And listen, Billy.
Thank you for all your help.

01:11:24.177 --> 01:11:25.660
I really appreciate it.

01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:26.960
I'm here if you need me, pal.

01:11:26.981 --> 01:11:29.139
I'll speak to you later, mate.
Speak to you soon, mate.

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:30.466
Bye for now. Bye.

01:12:10.553 --> 01:12:11.598
Hello?

01:12:11.621 --> 01:12:13.644
Is this John Northwood?

01:12:13.658 --> 01:12:15.176
Yeah. Who's calling?

01:12:15.194 --> 01:12:16.982
That doesn't matter.

01:12:16.997 --> 01:12:19.324
I have a client
who wants to speak to you.

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:21.964
I'm a bit busy just now. I can
give you somebody else's number...

01:12:21.972 --> 01:12:25.108
I insist that you speak to her.

01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:26.595
What's her name?

01:12:26.613 --> 01:12:28.097
I'll put her on.

01:12:31.554 --> 01:12:33.004
John?

01:14:20.568 --> 01:14:22.523
What's been going on in here?

01:14:23.305 --> 01:14:29.728
