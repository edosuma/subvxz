WEBVTT

00:21.400 --> 00:24.233
I'll be back. I'm free!

01:01.233 --> 01:03.766
My son, a Nobel Prize winner.

01:03.833 --> 01:07.200
Nobel Prizes, dad.
I won two at once.

01:07.266 --> 01:09.100
All because of this baby.

01:09.166 --> 01:11.100
To think
you'd cure the common cold

01:11.166 --> 01:13.566
with this
desinusizing contraption.

01:13.633 --> 01:15.833
Who could have imagined,
nasal decongestion

01:15.900 --> 01:18.533
will bring about world peace?

01:18.600 --> 01:21.666
All of man's aggressions
were centered in the sinuses.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.633
'Do you hear me?'

01:36.766 --> 01:39.366
Look, the next time
I have to leave work

01:39.433 --> 01:41.533
because you're in trouble,
I'm gonna yank you out of school

01:41.600 --> 01:43.400
and put you in the garage
changing tires.

01:43.466 --> 01:45.366
You don't need
a high school diploma for that.

01:45.433 --> 01:47.333
- I tried, dad, but..
- No buts.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.900
You...you're a squeaky wheel.

01:49.966 --> 01:51.900
You know what I mean?

01:53.100 --> 01:56.133
It's hard enough playin'
dad and mom to you kids.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.733
Look, look,
all I'm trying to do here is..

02:07.700 --> 02:10.266
I have to work late.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.433
Now, you, you pick up
Chris at 4 o'clock

02:12.500 --> 02:13.800
and see that he gets dinner.

02:13.866 --> 02:16.333
- You understand?
- I've got study hall.

02:17.066 --> 02:18.433
As in detention?

02:18.500 --> 02:19.566
I was late twice this week

02:19.633 --> 02:20.766
because I had to get
Chris to school.

02:20.833 --> 02:22.866
I don't wanna hear excuses

02:24.866 --> 02:27.133
You-you-you can't go
to study hall today.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.500
Now you explain
it to them. I'm late.

02:34.566 --> 02:35.733
Steven..

02:37.500 --> 02:39.933
...don't be a squeaky wheel.

02:55.933 --> 02:58.466
Your old man on your case again?

02:58.533 --> 03:00.233
He wants me to fit in.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.933
Whatever that means.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.700
"The Stranger."

03:03.766 --> 03:05.233
"Camus."

03:05.300 --> 03:07.366
Bad choice. You wanna fit in?

03:07.433 --> 03:08.866
Read "Teen Beat."

03:13.300 --> 03:14.800
A.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.666
'C.'

03:18.966 --> 03:20.766
B plus.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.133
Just what is that
supposed to be Mr. Dart?

03:28.200 --> 03:30.566
Uh, art, sir.

03:31.566 --> 03:34.233
The assignment
was to make a table.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.100
Uh, yes, sir, but..

03:36.166 --> 03:37.333
...if everyone made tables

03:37.400 --> 03:39.066
there'd be nothing
to put on them.

03:39.133 --> 03:40.233
Uh..

03:41.533 --> 03:43.766
See, I made it to scale.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.233
F...as in failure.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.733
F...as in summer school.

03:55.666 --> 03:58.600
They failed Einstein,
he still had a good life.

03:58.666 --> 04:00.566
Man, why do you do these things?

04:00.633 --> 04:03.166
Voices in my head said,
"Be creative."

04:03.233 --> 04:04.800
I was helpless.

04:07.866 --> 04:10.900
Uh, I need you to forge
the principal's signature.

04:10.966 --> 04:12.500
I've gotta get out
of study hall today.

04:12.566 --> 04:15.133
Again?
Why do you always involve me?

04:15.200 --> 04:17.033
'Cause you're my best friend.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.333
Because your mom
is Riley's secretary.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.733
And because you know
the principal's signature.

04:22.566 --> 04:23.800
We're gonna get busted.

04:23.866 --> 04:25.300
You've done it a hundred times.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.600
Look, if I get caught
cutting again

04:26.666 --> 04:28.100
Riley is going to kill me.

04:28.166 --> 04:30.566
So just this once,
do things his way.

04:30.633 --> 04:32.533
I can't, I have to pick up
my brother after school

04:32.600 --> 04:34.566
or my dad will kill me.

04:34.633 --> 04:37.400
- So you die either way.
- No sweat.

04:37.466 --> 04:39.566
If there are enough curves
you learn to hit 'em.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.766
Just sign on
the dotted line, please.

04:46.066 --> 04:48.966
Mom! What-what
are you doing here?

04:49.033 --> 04:51.066
I work here remember, dear?

04:51.900 --> 04:53.833
Steven.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.000
Principal Riley
would like to see you.

04:56.966 --> 04:58.100
Again.

04:58.166 --> 05:00.266
What did I do?

05:00.333 --> 05:02.100
Let's not keep
the principal waiting.

05:02.166 --> 05:04.366
I couldn't have done anything.
It's only first period.

05:14.766 --> 05:16.833
This time I'm sending Steve

05:16.900 --> 05:18.366
to the principal's office

05:18.433 --> 05:20.600
for a little higher education.

05:20.666 --> 05:23.133
You know I always say

05:23.200 --> 05:26.500
"Spare the blade,
spoil the child."

05:46.600 --> 05:48.533
Uh, I'm missing English.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.933
We're reading
the "Scarlet Letter."

05:52.000 --> 05:55.166
You know Hester Prynne does
with the minister and has a kid.

05:55.233 --> 05:57.266
So they put
a big red A on her dress.

05:58.466 --> 06:00.033
I wrote an essay
about how Hester

06:00.100 --> 06:02.100
was the first American feminist.

06:03.433 --> 06:05.433
I could see dating
a woman like that.

06:07.766 --> 06:09.366
Have a seat, Steven.

06:09.433 --> 06:11.133
Can't you even give me a hint?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.466
I mean what's going on?

06:12.533 --> 06:14.600
I'm sure Mr. Riley
will tell you.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.766
Okay. Okay.

06:16.833 --> 06:19.166
But at least Hester Prynne
knew what she did wrong.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.233
'That's right, Mr. Dart.'

06:48.300 --> 06:50.933
'Well, we'll have to hold him
here for the time being.'

06:51.000 --> 06:52.933
Hey, please,
don't call my father.

06:55.933 --> 06:57.933
We're ready for you, Mr. Dart.

07:09.233 --> 07:10.400
Dad.

07:10.466 --> 07:12.466
This is all a mistake.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.033
I didn't do anything really.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.500
I said I didn't have
time for this anymore.

07:17.566 --> 07:19.500
But I didn't do anything wrong.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.000
I like you, Steven.

07:32.733 --> 07:34.433
But..

07:34.500 --> 07:37.700
...because of the seriousness
of the situation

07:37.766 --> 07:40.066
I wanted to review your record

07:40.133 --> 07:41.633
before the authorities arrived.

07:41.700 --> 07:42.766
Authorities?

07:42.833 --> 07:44.466
'It's not your tardiness'

07:44.533 --> 07:46.866
or your disobedience

07:46.933 --> 07:50.000
or your inability to get along
with others that troubles me.

07:50.066 --> 07:52.133
It's your..

07:52.200 --> 07:54.933
...violation
of the school spirit.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.033
'Look at the way
you're dressed.'

07:57.100 --> 07:58.500
What's that got to do
with anything?

07:58.566 --> 08:00.666
Steven, are you happy here

08:00.733 --> 08:02.300
at Springwood High?

08:02.366 --> 08:03.800
Yeah, sort of.

08:03.866 --> 08:05.500
Then why can't you
just get along?

08:05.566 --> 08:06.633
I do get along.

08:06.700 --> 08:07.966
'Mr. Dart.'

08:09.533 --> 08:12.766
Has Steven always been
a problem child?

08:12.833 --> 08:14.266
Argumentative?

08:14.333 --> 08:17.233
'Blaming others
for his failings?'

08:17.300 --> 08:19.466
He's never been
what you'd call normal.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.700
He's the only one
who didn't shed a tear

08:22.766 --> 08:24.200
at his mother's funeral.

08:24.266 --> 08:25.600
'What's that supposed to mean?'

08:25.666 --> 08:28.000
You don't think I cared?
Are you crazy?

08:28.066 --> 08:30.400
Made me wonder
what's inside the kid, you know?

08:30.466 --> 08:32.266
I loved my mother
and you know it.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.433
Well..

08:34.500 --> 08:36.933
...we're going to have
to take some drastic action

08:37.000 --> 08:39.100
after this last little incident.

08:43.266 --> 08:45.333
Do what you have to do here.

08:50.466 --> 08:52.833
I'll take care of him
my way at home.

09:14.733 --> 09:16.666
At least tell me what I did!

09:31.433 --> 09:33.233
'The suspect's name
is Steven Dart.'

09:33.300 --> 09:35.033
'5'8", 140 pounds'

09:35.100 --> 09:37.033
'wearing a black coat.'

10:02.366 --> 10:04.033
'Suspect spotted. He's on foot.'

10:04.100 --> 10:06.033
'Headed towards Pearl Street.'

10:11.833 --> 10:13.866
'Unit 25,
we're on Pearl Street.'

10:13.933 --> 10:15.866
'We don't see him. You got him?'

10:17.400 --> 10:19.100
'Nope, not yet.'

10:38.466 --> 10:41.800
'Come on, he couldn't have
vanished into thin air.'

10:41.866 --> 10:44.200
'Keep looking, guys.
We gotta find him.'

11:20.500 --> 11:22.666
Thanks for getting me
off the street, man..

11:22.733 --> 11:24.333
..I think.

11:28.533 --> 11:30.233
Great place, huh?

11:31.900 --> 11:33.866
Nobody ever comes down here.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.400
It's all ours.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.033
'That's my math test.'

11:55.800 --> 11:57.900
We don't grade people here.

11:58.666 --> 12:00.433
We just live and let go.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.033
Listen, you've been
a big help but..

12:03.100 --> 12:04.833
...I gotta get back.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.133
I gotta straighten
this mess out.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.566
Back?

12:09.900 --> 12:11.833
You can't ever go back.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.966
That's where you'll be sleeping.

12:15.033 --> 12:17.533
That's the barracks.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.633
Used to be a modular math class.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.033
Uh, Wendy, uh, Alex

12:22.100 --> 12:23.866
I'd like you to meet Steve.

12:23.933 --> 12:25.866
Steve's another
behavior problem.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.033
Alex was born in Greece.

12:30.100 --> 12:33.333
Wendy skipped a couple
of grades in school

12:33.400 --> 12:34.800
and I'm left-handed.

12:34.866 --> 12:36.366
That can't be
why you're hiding here.

12:36.433 --> 12:38.066
We remind them

12:38.133 --> 12:40.600
that the system doesn't have
everything under control.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.533
- They don't like that.
- No.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.700
I must have done something
I can't remember.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.866
See, that's how
they make you feel.

12:53.666 --> 12:55.500
See, weeding the weirdos out

12:55.566 --> 12:58.400
it might make things easier..

12:58.466 --> 13:00.400
...but it doesn't
make it better.

13:05.466 --> 13:07.000
No more school.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.800
No more Riley.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.233
Sign me up.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.200
You've gotta
prove yourself first.

13:18.266 --> 13:20.200
I want you to do
one little thing.

13:21.466 --> 13:22.800
Name it.

13:34.433 --> 13:36.033
Fire when ready.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.466
Steven, don't do this.
You're not like them.

13:49.533 --> 13:52.200
Don't listen to him.

13:52.266 --> 13:55.066
He just wants you
to become a little robot.

13:55.133 --> 13:56.600
Marching down his halls

13:56.666 --> 14:00.033
saying, "Yes, sir.
No, sir. Of course, sir."

14:00.100 --> 14:01.633
That's not true.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.400
I try to nurture individuality.

14:04.466 --> 14:06.833
We-we-well, everyone
has to obey the rules.

14:06.900 --> 14:09.633
O-o-otherwise we'd have chaos.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.200
And the, and the rules
are so simple.

14:12.266 --> 14:14.900
Obey the rules means..

14:14.966 --> 14:17.600
...give up who you are.

14:17.666 --> 14:20.600
Conform until they can't tell
you from the next slug.

14:20.666 --> 14:23.100
There's nothing wrong
with a little conformity.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.533
Conform, why don't you just feed

14:25.600 --> 14:27.366
everybody into a meat grinder

14:27.433 --> 14:29.200
so they all come out the same?

14:29.266 --> 14:32.000
They're trying to make me
out to be the bad guy, Steve.

14:32.066 --> 14:34.366
You know, if-if you want
the real culprits

14:34.433 --> 14:36.433
go after your parents.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.433
They foist you on the schools

14:38.500 --> 14:40.333
and demand that we mold you

14:40.400 --> 14:41.633
into model citizens.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.166
I'm-I'm not to blame.

14:44.233 --> 14:46.366
You pull that trigger..

14:46.433 --> 14:48.500
...and you're one of us, Steve.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.433
No more school..

14:51.500 --> 14:54.100
...no more books..

14:54.166 --> 14:56.800
...no more teachers'
dirty looks.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.066
No more school, no more books

15:01.133 --> 15:03.633
no more teachers' dirty looks.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.000
No more school,
no more books

15:06.066 --> 15:07.933
no more teachers' dirty looks.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.900
No more school,
no more books

15:09.966 --> 15:11.700
no more teachers' dirty looks.

15:11.766 --> 15:14.133
You don't wanna kill me, Steve.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.833
You wanna kill your dad.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.000
He's the one you're angry with.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.233
My father?

15:25.300 --> 15:27.033
He's the problem.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.066
He probably worked
your mother to death.

15:37.566 --> 15:38.866
Yeah, yeah.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.000
That's it. Yeah.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.033
You..

15:44.100 --> 15:46.100
You did the right thing, Steve.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.800
You did the right thing.

15:47.866 --> 15:48.966
Come on.

15:49.033 --> 15:50.966
Steve, come on.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.366
Come on, let's get out of here.

15:52.433 --> 15:53.933
You know if they find out
you've let me loose

15:54.000 --> 15:55.433
we'll both be dead.

16:11.033 --> 16:12.966
- The bus.
- We can make it.

16:18.766 --> 16:20.600
- What?
- Get in!

16:20.666 --> 16:21.700
I saved your life.

16:21.766 --> 16:23.166
You should've shot me

16:23.233 --> 16:25.200
while you had the chance, kid.

17:00.300 --> 17:01.766
Mrs. Taylor?

17:25.500 --> 17:27.333
Oh, Matt! Man!

17:27.400 --> 17:29.000
Am I glad to see you.

17:29.066 --> 17:31.533
Steven. You don't fit in.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.033
You're odd. Your clothes, odd.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.700
Your ideas, odd.

17:35.766 --> 17:38.300
Your behavior, very odd.

17:38.366 --> 17:39.500
No wonder they are after you.

17:39.566 --> 17:41.500
What are you on?

17:42.800 --> 17:45.700
Julie, what is wrong
with everyone around here?

17:45.766 --> 17:47.500
I'm proud to be a member of

17:47.566 --> 17:49.933
The Future Homemakers
Of America Club.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.533
We learn domestic skills

17:51.600 --> 17:54.500
and raise money
for worthwhile charities.

17:54.566 --> 17:56.533
Please pledge what you can.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.700
Please pledge what you can.

17:58.766 --> 18:00.466
'Please pledge what you can.'

18:00.533 --> 18:01.733
Please pledge..

18:01.800 --> 18:03.566
Matt, what have
they done to you?

18:03.633 --> 18:06.900
Nothing, I'm an integrated
part of my community.

18:06.966 --> 18:09.533
'We want you to check
this new line for us.'

18:09.600 --> 18:11.366
Come on, we have
to get out of here.

18:11.433 --> 18:12.766
I like it here.

18:12.833 --> 18:14.433
Shut up. They're coming.

18:14.500 --> 18:15.766
'We just can't make them'

18:15.833 --> 18:18.366
as cheaply or as quickly
as you can.

19:13.466 --> 19:15.400
I don't believe this.

19:20.366 --> 19:21.800
He's brainwashed.

19:21.866 --> 19:24.133
Riley's turned them
into zombies or something.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.533
You seem agitated, student

19:26.600 --> 19:27.766
Let me give you a hand.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.233
We've gotta run
before they see us.

19:32.766 --> 19:34.700
You've got an artificial hand.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.233
What else would I have?

19:39.166 --> 19:41.100
I am a robot after all.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.366
I am the very best robot
I can be.

19:54.666 --> 19:56.033
'Take this one.'

19:56.100 --> 19:57.966
Some...defect

19:58.033 --> 20:00.100
in the design of the cranium.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.966
Come this way.

20:28.033 --> 20:30.533
'I want to show you
our production problems.'

20:30.600 --> 20:32.100
See that's why
we need your help.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.700
We simply
don't have the...knack

20:34.766 --> 20:38.066
for making fully
integrated robotic students.

20:46.366 --> 20:48.333
Some of them
are just squirrelly.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.100
You can't control them.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.300
They're unpredictable.
They're..

20:56.000 --> 20:57.466
Hey!

20:58.400 --> 20:59.533
Now we've got you.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.200
You'll never get away
with this.

21:01.266 --> 21:02.866
I'm gonna report
you to the school board.

21:02.933 --> 21:04.866
You're nothing
but a damn butcher..

21:06.200 --> 21:08.166
See what I mean?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.900
We have to replace this one.

21:11.966 --> 21:14.000
It's too damned aggressive.

21:15.033 --> 21:17.800
Mucked up the whole works.

21:58.466 --> 21:59.733
'Dart!'

22:02.766 --> 22:04.300
What are you doing here?

22:04.366 --> 22:06.233
I thought you wanted
to see me, sir.

22:06.300 --> 22:09.100
No. I wanted to see Dark!

22:10.600 --> 22:13.800
That damn computer spit out
the wrong name again.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.900
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Dart.

22:16.966 --> 22:19.300
No, no need to apologize.

22:19.366 --> 22:21.766
I'm sorry to have caused
anyone any inconvenience really.

22:21.833 --> 22:23.200
I'll just get out of your way.

22:23.266 --> 22:25.200
From now on
you won't even notice me.

22:26.033 --> 22:27.966
I learned my lesson.

22:35.100 --> 22:36.333
Hmm?

22:40.633 --> 22:42.333
C.

22:43.366 --> 22:44.933
'C plus.'

22:46.166 --> 22:47.833
B.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.500
A plus.

23:03.933 --> 23:06.466
That's how you break
somebody's spirit.

23:22.633 --> 23:25.366
Oh, God,
I can't stand the waiting.

23:25.433 --> 23:27.500
What if Matt didn't do well?

23:27.566 --> 23:28.833
He did fine.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.566
He's a good student.

23:30.633 --> 23:32.700
He studied hard
for those SAT exams.

23:32.766 --> 23:35.600
But his whole future
depends on those scores.

23:35.666 --> 23:37.833
College, good job

23:37.900 --> 23:39.400
a good life.

23:40.433 --> 23:42.500
The SAT scores, they're here.

24:11.066 --> 24:13.066
I aced the SATs

24:13.133 --> 24:14.833
just like I said I would.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.066
Oh!

24:20.133 --> 24:22.466
The next section
of the SAT review test

24:22.533 --> 24:24.700
involves antonyms.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.900
That's opposites.

24:30.833 --> 24:33.633
A little nervous, Mr. Taylor?

24:33.700 --> 24:35.200
'No, sir, one's making'

24:35.266 --> 24:38.000
such a big deal of these SATs.

24:38.066 --> 24:40.566
Like if we blow them, we have
to move out on the street

24:40.633 --> 24:43.333
and apply for food stamps.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.200
I mean, it's just
a multiple choice test.

24:46.266 --> 24:48.366
It's not life and death.

24:48.433 --> 24:50.766
But it's the closest thing
to it in high school.

25:22.366 --> 25:25.233
Some people just can't
take the pressure.

25:31.533 --> 25:33.933
I'd like to give
Smithers a multiple choice

25:34.000 --> 25:36.100
Forget him.
He teaches metal shop.

25:36.166 --> 25:39.033
He probably
can't even spell SAT.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.266
You'll do great tomorrow.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.833
Julie, if I don't go back
east to college with you

25:43.900 --> 25:45.200
will that make any difference?

25:45.266 --> 25:47.733
Not to me, but it will to you.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.400
What does that mean?

25:49.466 --> 25:52.266
It means don't drive
yourself crazy, okay?

25:52.333 --> 25:53.966
This is only a test.

25:54.033 --> 25:56.133
If this were actually
an important event

25:56.200 --> 25:59.066
it wouldn't be taking plac
at the high school.

25:59.133 --> 26:02.033
You think I'm gonna
let this get to me?

26:02.100 --> 26:05.266
Well, it's not my idea, it's
everyone else's dumping on me.

26:05.333 --> 26:07.400
Your parents are pretty
overheated about this, huh

26:07.466 --> 26:08.966
Yeah, you could say that.

26:09.033 --> 26:11.533
And the funny thing is
I'm not sure if I even wanna go.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.300
I thought we'd settled all that.

26:13.366 --> 26:15.266
We go to college, get great jobs

26:15.333 --> 26:17.066
have a two-income family

26:17.133 --> 26:19.433
become the ideal DINK couple.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.633
DINK?

26:21.700 --> 26:24.233
Double Income, No Kids.

26:24.300 --> 26:26.100
You know, I sent out
that music demo.

26:26.166 --> 26:28.366
If the record company calls me
and offers me a contract

26:28.433 --> 26:30.666
I won't even have
time for school.

26:30.733 --> 26:33.000
Well, if you don't make
the top 40

26:33.066 --> 26:35.166
you better make a top college.

26:35.233 --> 26:36.566
Which is why I'll be singing

26:36.633 --> 26:39.033
the SAT blues tonight.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.200
Stop worrying.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.400
"Equal amounts of peanuts,
cashews and almonds

27:09.466 --> 27:11.533
"are packed separately in bags.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.500
"If three bags,
one of each kind

27:13.566 --> 27:15.866
"costs a total of $3

27:15.933 --> 27:17.266
"and two bags of peanuts

27:17.333 --> 27:20.700
"and two bags of cashews
costs a total of 3.50

27:20.766 --> 27:23.500
"how much does one bag
of almonds cost?"

27:26.533 --> 27:27.866
I hate nuts.

27:46.266 --> 27:48.066
Have some more
potatoes, Mr. Giles.

27:48.133 --> 27:50.366
Please, call me Fred.

27:50.433 --> 27:52.266
Roy has been working
at the bank for so long

27:52.333 --> 27:54.100
I feel like we're family.

27:54.166 --> 27:55.800
I didn't know
you were a banker, Mr. Taylor.

27:55.866 --> 27:57.400
Oh, I'm not.

27:57.466 --> 27:59.666
I, uh, I'm in
the cleaning business.

27:59.733 --> 28:01.466
Mr. Giles pushes pencils

28:01.533 --> 28:02.866
I push brooms.

28:02.933 --> 28:04.966
You run
a janitorial service, dad.

28:05.033 --> 28:07.000
Yeah, but I never went
to college though.

28:07.066 --> 28:09.566
That's why you're gonna
be the first one. Right, son?

28:09.633 --> 28:11.600
Huh, depends on the SATs.

28:11.666 --> 28:14.933
Which we all know
are going to be sterling.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.300
That's why I've agreed
to conduct

28:16.366 --> 28:18.500
your college interview myself.

28:18.566 --> 28:19.900
May I have
some more ham, please?

28:19.966 --> 28:23.033
Matt, pass this
to Julie, will you?

28:23.100 --> 28:25.966
There are six slices
of meat left.

28:26.033 --> 28:28.033
If Julie eats two slices

28:28.100 --> 28:30.866
chewing an average
of ten times before swallowing

28:30.933 --> 28:33.266
'and if each chew
takes on the average'

28:33.333 --> 28:34.733
'a quarter of a second'

28:34.800 --> 28:36.066
'how long will it take before'

28:36.133 --> 28:38.466
Julie has consumed both pieces?

28:40.600 --> 28:41.933
Matt?

28:42.733 --> 28:43.866
Matt?

28:45.366 --> 28:46.633
I don't know.

28:46.700 --> 28:48.566
Don't know what, dear?

28:48.633 --> 28:50.966
I just asked you
to pass the meat to Julie.

28:55.966 --> 28:57.133
Oh, I'm sorry.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.666
'Here.'

29:00.400 --> 29:01.600
I'm looking forward
to giving you

29:01.666 --> 29:03.900
a good recommendation, Matt.

29:03.966 --> 29:05.100
'And a good recommendation'

29:05.166 --> 29:07.900
is to success as A..

29:07.966 --> 29:09.433
...dirt is to flowers.

29:09.500 --> 29:10.933
B, cars are to gasoline.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.166
C, calculators are to audits.

29:13.233 --> 29:16.000
Or D, math..

29:16.066 --> 29:17.433
...is to business.

29:21.133 --> 29:22.333
Matt?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.933
Didn't you hear Mr. Giles?

29:28.233 --> 29:30.500
I said what are you
going to major in?

29:30.566 --> 29:33.466
Math? Business?

29:33.533 --> 29:35.066
Uh, music I think.

29:35.133 --> 29:36.600
Music?

29:36.666 --> 29:38.400
For a future banker?

29:38.466 --> 29:41.300
No, nickels and dimes in that.

29:41.366 --> 29:43.700
But I like music.
It makes me happy.

29:43.766 --> 29:46.133
- Sad..
- Sad?

29:46.200 --> 29:47.866
Happy..

29:47.933 --> 29:50.433
- I think I'm overtired.
- Rested.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.366
Why do you keep saying the
opposite of everything I say?

29:52.433 --> 29:53.766
You're making me nervous.

29:53.833 --> 29:55.600
- Calm.
- Stop.

29:55.666 --> 29:56.900
- Go.
- This isn't funny.

29:56.966 --> 29:58.733
- Serious.
- Cut that out.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.533
In.

30:00.600 --> 30:01.800
'Matt?'

30:03.066 --> 30:04.400
Matt?

30:04.466 --> 30:05.600
Matt!

30:05.666 --> 30:07.033
Is something wrong?

30:10.666 --> 30:12.033
It's my fault.

30:12.100 --> 30:14.733
I shouldn't be
grilling him about college

30:14.800 --> 30:16.633
He still has his SATs

30:16.700 --> 30:18.700
to think about.

30:18.766 --> 30:20.233
Right?

30:20.300 --> 30:22.233
Matt, get us
some coffee, will you?

30:33.533 --> 30:35.600
Okay, Matt,
it's a math problem.

30:36.666 --> 30:38.600
Now, if the rectangle we form

30:38.666 --> 30:40.033
has a perimeter of 20

30:40.100 --> 30:41.600
and a length of six.

30:41.666 --> 30:43.233
What's our area?

30:44.800 --> 30:46.633
I don't know.

30:47.400 --> 30:48.866
I don't know.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.400
I...I don't know.

30:58.466 --> 31:01.233
It's okay, Matt.
It's just a coffee cup.

31:08.466 --> 31:10.100
You alright, son?

31:11.100 --> 31:12.833
Have some pie.

31:12.900 --> 31:15.000
Dessert always perks you up.

31:15.066 --> 31:16.766
The pie looks delicious.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.333
It's divided into triangles.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.700
What's the sum of the angles
of those triangles?

31:24.400 --> 31:26.433
You gotta be faster, son.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.400
Your boy has a tendency
to choke.

31:36.433 --> 31:38.633
He just needs to study
some more.

31:44.933 --> 31:46.700
It's never too late

31:46.766 --> 31:49.066
to cram for an exam.

32:03.833 --> 32:05.100
Hi.

32:06.266 --> 32:08.666
I thought you might
need some food.

32:08.733 --> 32:11.466
Oh, you look terrible.

32:11.533 --> 32:13.800
You should get some rest.

32:13.866 --> 32:16.633
Gotta be sharp
for that test tomorrow.

32:16.700 --> 32:20.166
- God, I wish this was over.
- Oh, it's gonna be okay.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.866
'Alright, everybody,
pencils up.'

32:33.933 --> 32:36.300
'Break the seal.'

32:36.366 --> 32:38.266
You look awful.

32:38.333 --> 32:39.500
No sleep.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.166
Ready?

32:41.233 --> 32:42.966
'Begin.'

32:43.033 --> 32:44.633
Good luck.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.933
'Alright, time's up.'

33:32.000 --> 33:33.566
Pencils down.

33:33.633 --> 33:36.733
Leave your tests on the table.

33:51.266 --> 33:54.633
I completely blanked with some
of those geometric formulas.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.500
- How 'bout you?
- No, I got those okay.

33:57.566 --> 33:59.366
And that vocabulary, I mean..

33:59.433 --> 34:01.200
...some of those words
were impossible.

34:01.266 --> 34:03.366
What's the opposite of torpor?

34:03.433 --> 34:05.700
Uh, vivacity.

34:05.766 --> 34:08.100
But who says torpor anyway

34:08.166 --> 34:09.733
You must've aced it.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.333
No, it's hard to tell.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.766
But I feel better than
I did three hours ago.

34:13.833 --> 34:15.233
At least it's over.

34:15.300 --> 34:17.100
So all that stuff
about skipping college

34:17.166 --> 34:20.366
to become a music bum
was just SAT nerves, right?

34:20.433 --> 34:23.166
Yeah, I guess there's no future
without an education.

34:23.233 --> 34:25.500
At least that's what
everybody says to me.

34:25.566 --> 34:28.100
I guess I pretty much
have to go.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.366
Yeah, you do.

34:30.433 --> 34:33.233
Because that's where I'll be
and I want us to be together.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.733
So everything boils down
to that stupid test.

34:50.533 --> 34:52.566
I gotta run.

34:52.633 --> 34:54.733
Good luck
with your college interview.

34:56.200 --> 34:57.800
Another test.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.800
Good GPA.

35:05.233 --> 35:07.666
And you've lettered
in three sports. Impressive.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.300
And of course, those SATs

35:11.366 --> 35:13.500
are going to be great, right?

35:13.566 --> 35:15.000
Oh, yeah, they will be.

35:15.066 --> 35:16.766
'Good.'

35:16.833 --> 35:19.800
'Because it's pure magic
what good SAT scores'

35:19.866 --> 35:21.200
can do for your life.

35:21.266 --> 35:23.400
They transform you.

35:23.466 --> 35:26.100
They make you into..

35:26.166 --> 35:27.933
...a player.

35:29.333 --> 35:30.900
'Go ahead.'

35:30.966 --> 35:33.200
That could be yours.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.433
You see what
good SAT scores can mean?

35:42.533 --> 35:44.300
'You're in control.'

35:47.633 --> 35:49.033
It's your office.

35:49.100 --> 35:50.366
It's for you.

35:53.533 --> 35:55.700
Um, Matt Taylor.

35:57.466 --> 35:59.200
Uh, alright, could you

35:59.266 --> 36:02.100
could you hold on a second?

36:02.166 --> 36:04.266
Someone says I'm foreclosing
on their mortgage.

36:04.333 --> 36:06.400
They're begging me
for another month.

36:08.366 --> 36:11.833
Ask them how they did
on their SATs.

36:13.433 --> 36:15.433
How are your SAT scores?

36:17.600 --> 36:20.566
Lousy, barely cleared 900.

36:20.633 --> 36:23.433
You think people like that
are gonna come through?

36:24.366 --> 36:25.900
Not a chance.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.033
Sorry.

36:31.900 --> 36:34.066
Of course,
if you blow your SATs..

36:35.100 --> 36:36.566
...all this goes..

36:39.633 --> 36:42.233
'So you see how important
your test scores are.'

36:43.700 --> 36:45.966
They mean the difference
between the penthouse..

36:47.066 --> 36:48.600
...and the outhouse.

37:02.233 --> 37:04.166
They came. I got my scores.

37:05.900 --> 37:06.933
Ta-da!

37:07.000 --> 37:09.933
I hit a home run.
1520 out of 1600.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.500
Home run?
Make that a grand slam.

37:13.566 --> 37:16.400
If I got 1520, you must've
gotten a perfect score.

37:19.133 --> 37:21.366
Hey, Julie, let's get movin'!

37:23.033 --> 37:25.300
What's with Tony
in the front seat?

37:25.366 --> 37:26.433
Oh, nothing,
we're just going to buy

37:26.500 --> 37:28.433
some winter clothes
for college.

37:30.233 --> 37:31.333
What's the big deal?

37:31.400 --> 37:32.666
You're the one
I'm gonna be studying with

37:32.733 --> 37:34.866
on those cold winter
nights, right?

37:37.533 --> 37:38.966
My scores.

37:42.466 --> 37:44.133
He's got my scores.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.766
Oh, God.

38:03.433 --> 38:05.866
Come on.
Don't take all day. Open it.

38:19.666 --> 38:22.600
Eight hundred, combined.

38:24.366 --> 38:26.266
I bombed it completely.

38:26.333 --> 38:28.000
W-w-wait, failing a test

38:28.066 --> 38:30.266
does not make me a failure.

38:30.333 --> 38:32.400
Wha..
I'm still the same person.

38:33.433 --> 38:34.666
Dad?

38:34.733 --> 38:36.333
Mom?

38:36.400 --> 38:39.566
This is not the end of my life,
I'm still your son.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.533
'God, can you believe
we actually spent'

39:01.600 --> 39:04.333
'four years of our lives
in this place?'

39:04.400 --> 39:06.000
'It doesn't even have a pool.'

39:06.066 --> 39:08.000
'Thank God for college.'

39:09.600 --> 39:10.800
Hello?

39:11.866 --> 39:13.166
Mr. Smithers?

39:14.933 --> 39:16.666
He probably
doesn't even remember us.

39:16.733 --> 39:19.600
He barely remembered us
when we were in his class.

39:19.666 --> 39:22.633
Well, I sure remember
this place.

39:22.700 --> 39:24.800
The site of the great SATs.

39:27.633 --> 39:29.600
I owe a lot to the SATs.

39:30.633 --> 39:32.566
So where do you
suppose everyone is?

39:34.500 --> 39:35.933
Excuse me.

39:37.900 --> 39:40.166
The teachers
are all gone for the day.

39:41.266 --> 39:42.700
Matt?

39:42.766 --> 39:44.833
Hey, Matt.

39:44.900 --> 39:46.866
Good to see
you finally got a job.

39:46.933 --> 39:49.800
A maintenance engineer,
impressive.

39:49.866 --> 39:52.600
No, I-I don't usually do this,
my dad's been sick.

39:52.666 --> 39:54.333
I'm just filling in.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.466
Sure, I understand.

39:56.533 --> 39:59.233
Bob, Carol, this is Matt.

39:59.300 --> 40:01.233
He used to be..

40:02.500 --> 40:05.200
Uh, we all went
to high school together.

40:05.266 --> 40:07.200
Matt still goes here.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.333
Hey, maybe we can get together
sometime, huh, Julie?

40:10.400 --> 40:13.833
I'll, uh, fill you in
on all the Springwood gossip.

40:13.900 --> 40:17.333
I can't, um, we're just gonna
be in town for a few days.

40:18.133 --> 40:19.633
Maybe next time.

40:20.633 --> 40:22.566
It was nice seeing you.

40:45.900 --> 40:47.333
Oh, God.

41:16.033 --> 41:17.366
'When I approved your loan'

41:17.433 --> 41:19.166
'I assumed you were
going to keep up'

41:19.233 --> 41:20.700
'the mortgage payments.'

41:20.766 --> 41:22.800
'But Roy's been sick.'

41:22.866 --> 41:24.933
'Business is business.'

41:26.366 --> 41:27.833
Money was put on this Eart

41:27.900 --> 41:29.933
to be fruitful and multiply.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
If your payments are late.

41:32.066 --> 41:33.533
...that can't happen.

41:33.600 --> 41:35.133
Roy has worked for you

41:35.200 --> 41:37.166
for over 20 years.

41:37.233 --> 41:38.866
And he did an excellent job

41:38.933 --> 41:40.600
of keeping those washrooms clean

41:40.666 --> 41:43.100
but that was then..

41:43.166 --> 41:44.600
...and this is now.

41:44.666 --> 41:45.900
Look at him.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.233
Matt will be here
any minute with his paycheck.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.033
That should cover the mortgage.

41:53.100 --> 41:55.566
Wait until Matt
gets here, please.

41:55.633 --> 41:57.266
Matt may not arrive for hours.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.066
I could be an escrow by then.

41:59.133 --> 42:00.766
No, here he comes, look.

42:00.833 --> 42:03.100
Oh, thank God, you're home.

42:03.166 --> 42:04.566
We're being foreclosed

42:04.633 --> 42:07.100
unless you give Mr. Giles
your paycheck.

42:07.166 --> 42:10.433
- Mom, there was an accident.
- Just give him the check.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.766
No, I broke an expensive
piece of equipment.

42:12.833 --> 42:14.733
Tell me about it later.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.366
'Mom, I've lost the account,
I don't have a check.'

42:19.900 --> 42:21.133
Please..

42:22.000 --> 42:24.333
Please, Mr. Giles.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.233
'Just give us a few more days.'

42:26.300 --> 42:28.066
Not a chance.

42:28.133 --> 42:29.766
'Business is business.'

42:29.833 --> 42:32.800
Besides, without the school
account there's no way

42:32.866 --> 42:34.966
you can keep up your mortgage.

42:43.300 --> 42:45.066
Roy?

42:45.133 --> 42:46.766
- Roy?
- Dad?

42:46.833 --> 42:48.266
- Roy!
- 'I'm sorry.'

42:48.366 --> 42:50.200
Roy!

42:53.766 --> 42:55.166
Mom, he's dead.

42:58.466 --> 43:01.300
It's all because of those SATs.

43:01.366 --> 43:03.100
Oh, Roy.

43:39.666 --> 43:41.900
Congratulations!

43:41.966 --> 43:44.900
They just came this morning,
honey, we're so proud of you.

43:47.066 --> 43:49.333
Oh, I love you, you genius

43:54.366 --> 43:56.900
Well, what do you know.

44:02.533 --> 44:04.466
'Alright, time's up.'

44:05.733 --> 44:07.900
Leave your SAT tests
on the desk.

44:07.966 --> 44:10.733
'You'll be mailed the results
in about a month. Good luck.'

44:22.600 --> 44:25.633
Wait, uh, I fell asleep,
I have to take this again.

44:25.700 --> 44:28.566
I'm afraid there's nothing
I can do about that, Mr. Taylor.

44:28.633 --> 44:30.700
You must've seen me.
Why didn't you wake me up?

44:30.766 --> 44:33.300
Look, just take them
again next year.

44:33.366 --> 44:35.133
No. No-no-no.
Everything's all set.

44:35.200 --> 44:36.666
I mean, my girlfriend's
going to college

44:36.733 --> 44:38.766
and Mr. Giles
won't recommend me to Harvard.

44:38.833 --> 44:40.000
Now he'll think I'm a flake.

44:40.066 --> 44:43.200
Survival of the fittest,
Matt, I warned you.

44:43.266 --> 44:45.166
Just give me a second chance.

44:45.233 --> 44:46.866
I'm afraid it's out of my hands.

44:46.933 --> 44:48.033
Sorry.

45:06.433 --> 45:08.066
You know you're the one
who said it was only a test.

45:08.133 --> 45:10.100
I wanted you to relax,
not go into a coma.

45:10.166 --> 45:11.400
Don't you care about college?

45:11.466 --> 45:13.666
Maybe I care too much,
I let everything get to me

45:13.733 --> 45:16.166
Well, to hell with them.
I, I don't want any of it.

45:16.233 --> 45:17.666
You'd rather be a failure.

45:17.733 --> 45:20.166
Failing a test
does not make me a failure.

45:44.233 --> 45:46.766
- 'Matt Taylor?'
- Yeah, that's me.

45:46.833 --> 45:48.700
Your mother said you'd be here.

45:48.766 --> 45:50.900
Did you send us
a demo tape of your music?

45:51.900 --> 45:53.966
Yes, I did.

45:54.033 --> 45:56.433
You have a very big future
young man.

45:56.500 --> 45:58.133
A very big future.

45:58.200 --> 46:00.400
Splash Records wants you.

46:02.733 --> 46:05.633
N-now! I mean, now?

46:05.700 --> 46:08.200
Well, unless
you have other plans.

46:08.266 --> 46:10.066
No, ma'am.

46:10.133 --> 46:11.600
This way.

46:44.133 --> 46:45.566
Oh.

46:50.100 --> 46:51.366
A mind..

46:51.433 --> 46:54.233
...is a terrible thing
to waste.

46:59.466 --> 47:01.233
Mm-mm-mm.
