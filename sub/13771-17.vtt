There's no snacks.

00:03.699 --> 00:05.396
I don't want to watch a movie
without snacks.

There's always...

Usually I spend every minute
I'm at Lucky Aide

01:05.325 --> 01:06.892
cursing Mom
for making me work here,

01:06.979 --> 01:08.633
but lately
it hasn't seemed so bad.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.768
I'm not sure why.

01:12.855 --> 01:14.030
Malcolm, you were right.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.292
I put a greasy bag
in the fridge,

01:15.379 --> 01:16.772
and Craig put his name on it.

01:16.859 --> 01:18.208
Yeah, the only way
to protect anything

01:18.295 --> 01:20.080
is to put it in
a nonfat yogurt carton.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.211
That's brilliant.

01:21.298 --> 01:22.604
Wait. You got something.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.041
Thanks.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.477
She didn't have anything.

01:26.564 --> 01:27.783
So, hey, it turns out

01:27.870 --> 01:29.001
I don't have to go
with my parents

01:29.089 --> 01:30.351
to Yosemite over spring break.

01:30.438 --> 01:31.874
So I guess you'll be
in town then, huh?

01:31.961 --> 01:33.310
-Looks like it.
-You know, me, too.

01:33.397 --> 01:35.138
Maybe we can...

01:35.225 --> 01:36.139
Malcolm, your break doesn't
start for another two minutes.

01:36.226 --> 01:37.358
Wendy, your break is over now.

01:38.881 --> 01:41.405
This is why orphans
get all the hot girls.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.015
Oh, God.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.366
I've got graveyard shift
for the next two weeks?

01:45.453 --> 01:47.237
I didn't know I had
any joy left in my life

01:47.324 --> 01:48.586
to be sucked out.

01:48.673 --> 01:49.457
I guess you're going
to have to take

01:49.544 --> 01:50.719
the bus to work, Malcolm.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.068
You're going to
be on your own.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.418
Great. Figures.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.768
If I can bite through my tongue
till my teeth meet

01:56.855 --> 01:58.379
maybe Mom won't see me smile.

02:03.297 --> 02:04.254
All right,
here's Jamie's schedule

02:04.341 --> 02:06.038
for the next two weeks.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.170
He needs a bath at 6:00, 8:00,
and before he goes to bed.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.651
We talked
about Jamie's schedule.

02:09.738 --> 02:13.002
I want to talk
about our schedule.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.438
We already talked
about that schedule.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.527
I know, but I like
coming home for lunch

02:16.614 --> 02:19.313
to be a special treat,
not just for my survival.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.792
Well, I'm not happy
about it either,

02:20.879 --> 02:22.533
but working graveyard
is just part of the job.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.796
Have you told Malcolm you're
making him do it with you?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.298

02:48.385 --> 02:50.213
the whole bed to myself before.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.649
You stay off
my side of the bed!

I don't care
if I'm not there.

And stop smiling!

02:55.044 --> 02:56.219
Okay.

02:57.394 --> 02:58.482
The only bright spot

02:58.569 --> 03:00.092
in all this
is that Reese has

03:00.180 --> 03:02.965
an even crappier
spring break job than I do.

03:03.052 --> 03:05.272
[van rattling]

You didn't do
too bad today, kid.

you were way ahead.

So... he didn't
have rabies, did he?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.239
No. No, no, no.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.980
He checked out fine.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.547
Say, uh,

03:19.634 --> 03:21.549
you going to be able
to sit up soon,

03:21.636 --> 03:23.072
'cause we're
almost at your house.

03:23.159 --> 03:24.595
These fumes are kind of strong.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.076
Can I get one of those
paper masks next time?

03:27.163 --> 03:29.165
Do I look like
I'm made of money?

03:30.906 --> 03:32.603
[clattering]

03:32.690 --> 03:35.171
You got a different
kind of a job tomorrow.

What's this?

03:37.260 --> 03:38.783
That's a thousand
caterpillars.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.481
Tomorrow morning,
get up before dawn,

03:40.568 --> 03:42.700
Want you to go around
the neighborhood,

03:42.787 --> 03:44.006
sprinkle those
in the rose bushes,

03:44.093 --> 03:45.355
flower beds, front lawns...

03:45.442 --> 03:47.575
And then I want you
to take my business card

03:47.662 --> 03:49.751
and drop it in the mailbox,
you understand?

03:49.838 --> 03:52.014
Why do you sound very far away?

03:52.101 --> 03:54.973
Don't go to sleep for a while.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.677
It sucks you have
to work the night shift.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.374
Now you're going
to miss the party.

Debbie's parents
are out of town.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.290

Probably won't miss much.

It's just the same
boring people

04:09.205 --> 04:10.859
doing the same
boring stuff.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.426
Whoa, I gotta run.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.341
Skinny-dipping
starts at midnight.

04:14.428 --> 04:17.344
[crying softly]

04:17.430 --> 04:19.128
Hey, Malcolm.

04:19.214 --> 04:20.911
At what age do you
just accept that your life

04:20.999 --> 04:22.958
is a piece of rotten garbage
and always will be?

04:23.045 --> 04:24.394
Twenty-two.

04:24.481 --> 04:25.613
But that doesn't mean
you can't enjoy

04:25.700 --> 04:26.788

04:26.875 --> 04:27.963
Take tonight.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.530
You're in for a real treat.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.749
There's a different rhythm
to the night shift.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.534
It's a camaraderie,

04:33.621 --> 04:35.405
a brotherhood
of kindred souls,

04:35.492 --> 04:36.885
a nocturnal fraternity

04:36.972 --> 04:39.061

the inky netherworld.

Where's the toothpaste?

04:41.542 --> 04:42.543
I'm on a break.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.589
Make sure all the pens
are cap-side up

04:45.676 --> 04:47.199
with the pocket clips
facing forward.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.723
This is the benefit

04:48.810 --> 04:49.941
of graveyard shift.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.203
You don't
have all that chaos

04:51.291 --> 04:52.161
that goes on
during the daytime.

04:52.248 --> 04:53.293
You can get
things organized

04:53.380 --> 04:54.555
the way they're meant to be.

04:54.642 --> 04:55.860
You're just trying
to torture me.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.297
That's why I'm here.
Just admit it.

04:57.384 --> 04:58.689
You're here
because you need the money.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.300
I give you three-quarters
of my paycheck.

05:00.387 --> 05:01.431
That's why you need the money.

05:01.518 --> 05:02.432
[sighs]

05:03.912 --> 05:05.000
That's weird.

05:05.087 --> 05:06.871
-Did you see anyone?
-What?

05:06.958 --> 05:08.699
Someone left a candy wrapper
and change on the counter here,

05:08.786 --> 05:10.310
but nobody's
been in the store for hours.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.659
It was probably a mouse.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.313
A mouse that left
the exact change?

05:13.400 --> 05:15.010
I played tic-tac-toe
with a chicken

05:15.097 --> 05:16.403
at the county fair,

05:16.490 --> 05:18.622
and it beat me
eight times in a row.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.146
Don't shortchange animals.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.279
I didn't see anyone though.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.977
Never mind.

05:26.064 --> 05:28.502
Wait, aren't you even curious
how that happened?

05:28.589 --> 05:31.113
Malcolm, everything doesn't
have to be fascinating.

05:33.637 --> 05:36.597
Now it looks like the guy in
the hockey mask is dead, right?

05:36.684 --> 05:39.208
But just keep your eye
on that coffin.

[woman screaming on TV]

05:40.688 --> 05:42.167

05:42.254 --> 05:43.647
Why aren't you at work?

05:43.734 --> 05:45.562
I don't want to hear
that you're too good

05:45.649 --> 05:47.390
to crawl under houses
poisoning rats all day.

05:47.477 --> 05:50.393
There are ten guys with MBAs
who would love to have that job.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.873
I didn't quit.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.222
I showed up this morning,
and the cops were there.

05:53.309 --> 05:54.702
It turns out Mr. Krijak

05:54.789 --> 05:56.747
was renting out his gas
tanks for parties.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.794
Now I have to dump this stupid
box of caterpillars... for free!

06:00.969 --> 06:03.711
Have a nice death, puss-bags.

06:03.798 --> 06:04.712
Hey!

06:04.799 --> 06:07.192
Get off of me.

06:07.279 --> 06:10.152
Oh, a tough guy, huh?

06:11.806 --> 06:12.894
Hey...
[laughs]

06:12.981 --> 06:14.374
Cut it out.
That tickles.

06:15.679 --> 06:16.593
[chuckles softly]

06:34.437 --> 06:36.483
Craig, did you do this?

06:36.570 --> 06:37.788
Do what?

06:37.875 --> 06:38.833
Those vitamins
that were recalled.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.487
Did you clear off this shelf?

06:40.574 --> 06:42.010
Doesn't sound like me.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.359
Six coats of wax,

06:43.446 --> 06:45.230
and I buttered up my socks.

06:45.317 --> 06:47.145
The record's going down.

06:47.232 --> 06:48.930
You know,
things have been getting

06:49.017 --> 06:50.497
really weird around here.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.803
I mean,
think about it.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.414
Last night all the clocks
in the display case

06:54.501 --> 06:55.937
were synchronized
to the same time.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.721
And the night
before that,

06:57.808 --> 06:59.506
all the fingerprints were
cleaned off the freezer doors.

06:59.593 --> 07:00.985
Malcolm,
I think you're forgetting

07:01.072 --> 07:03.988
the graveyard shift
motto: "Who cares?"

07:12.388 --> 07:14.390
It doesn't matter
if no one else knows.

07:14.477 --> 07:15.609
You know.

07:19.047 --> 07:22.050
Okay, Dewey gets
the pancakes and eggs.

07:23.312 --> 07:25.401
And Lois has
the veal parmesan.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.708
Oh, look at you, Jamie.

07:27.795 --> 07:28.970
You have changed so much

07:29.057 --> 07:30.188
in just a week.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.842
Your head's almost symmetrical.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.104
You better eat up--
don't you need

07:33.191 --> 07:34.584
to be in bed
before I go to work?

07:34.671 --> 07:35.933
Honey, I'm spending
some time with my son,

07:36.020 --> 07:38.109
who I've barely seen
in the last week.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.676
You've got 18
years for that.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.286
I'm only asking
for ten minutes.

07:42.418 --> 07:46.117
Wow, another
great night's sleep.

07:46.204 --> 07:47.989
No fighting
for blankets,

07:48.076 --> 07:50.513
no elbows in my face,
or anything worse.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.995
Just all the room in the world.

07:54.082 --> 07:56.040
Don't freak out when you get
into your side of the bed.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.956
It looks bad, but most
of it's only a MoonPie.

07:59.043 --> 08:01.306
Did you know the Latin name
for this little guy

08:01.393 --> 08:02.830
is Danaus plexippus,
and that he actually

08:02.917 --> 08:04.571
crawls out of
his own skin to pupate?

08:04.658 --> 08:07.008
Then the outer layer
hardens into the chrysalis.

08:07.095 --> 08:08.357
That's Greek for "golden."

08:08.444 --> 08:09.445
And once they turn
into butterflies,

08:09.532 --> 08:10.620
they can migrate

08:10.707 --> 08:11.839
up to 2,000 miles.

08:11.926 --> 08:12.840
Pretty awesome, huh?

08:12.927 --> 08:14.276
[watch beeping]

08:14.363 --> 08:16.931
Oh, got to feed them
some more milkweed.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.454
Wow.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.890
That's the first time
I've ever seen Reese

08:19.977 --> 08:22.763
take a concerned interest
in another living thing.

08:22.850 --> 08:25.679
It's kind of nice to know
he's got a compassionate side.

08:25.766 --> 08:28.769
I want those revolting bugs in
the trash by tomorrow morning.

08:31.989 --> 08:32.860
Craig.

08:32.947 --> 08:34.164
Take a look at this.

08:34.251 --> 08:35.775
If you don't mind,

08:35.863 --> 08:37.952
I'm trying to get in
a quick nap before my break.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.082
Seriously.
Check out this guy.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.566
He's here, and then
two hours later...

08:45.176 --> 08:47.614
...he's still there,

08:47.701 --> 08:49.485

17:52.462 --> 17:54.464
Rules say we get paid
time and a half

17:54.551 --> 17:55.639
for the graveyard shift.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.119
The rules say

17:57.206 --> 17:58.555
trespassers are dealt
with by the police.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.253
You can't just pick
and choose what rules

18:00.340 --> 18:02.516
you want to follow, or the
whole system breaks down.

18:02.603 --> 18:03.952
-But...
-Malcolm, I'm sorry.

18:04.039 --> 18:05.562
But as long as I'm working here,

18:05.649 --> 18:07.347
I can't bend the rules
for anyone.

18:09.827 --> 18:13.004
-7:30. Shift's over.
-What are you doing?

18:13.092 --> 18:14.441
I'm off the clock.
I'm going home.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.573
Everybody else can do
whatever they want.

18:18.227 --> 18:19.794
But they better
do it quick.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.230
They don't have a lot of time.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.149
Thank you.

18:27.236 --> 18:28.194
For what?

18:29.717 --> 18:32.546
Great. She lets that guy walk,
but makes a federal case

18:32.633 --> 18:35.984
whenever I put my phone number
in with the birth control pills.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.638
Hi, Malcolm.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.074
Oh, hey, Wendy.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.771
Did you get the blue
irises I sent you?

18:40.858 --> 18:42.251
Yeah, I did.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.427
How did you know those
were my favorite flowers?

18:44.514 --> 18:45.776
Well, you know, I guess

18:45.863 --> 18:47.387
we just really
have a lot in common.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.606
Like loving grilled cheese
and tomato sandwiches

18:49.693 --> 18:50.912
and Stephen King books.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.261
-[chuckles]
-I wouldn't be surprised

18:52.348 --> 18:54.263
if you were a big
Coldplay fan, too.

18:55.786 --> 18:56.874
What the hell are you doing?

18:56.961 --> 18:58.006
Following me around?

18:58.093 --> 18:59.486
Are you stalking me?

18:59.573 --> 19:01.096
No. No, no.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.967
I guess we're just
really in sync.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.839
Is that so weird? I mean,
sometimes two people...

19:04.926 --> 19:06.754
You stay away from me, creep!

19:10.627 --> 19:11.976
Don't worry, buddy.

19:12.063 --> 19:14.109
Even I get
that sometimes.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.678
Dad, the toilet
lid was up,

19:17.765 --> 19:19.245
and Jamie's tongue
is blue again.

19:19.332 --> 19:20.637
-JAMIE: Dad.
-[rapping on the door]

19:24.032 --> 19:25.555
Ahh. [laughs]

19:25.642 --> 19:27.470
Whoo! Okay.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.080
Did you spend all
night out there?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.647
My choice.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.301
It's very bracing out there.
[chuckles]

19:32.388 --> 19:35.261
Now why don't you help
me into the shower

19:35.348 --> 19:38.960
and see if we can't
save your dad's toes.

19:46.359 --> 19:48.709
Oh, my God.

19:48.796 --> 19:51.146
Winston, is that you?

19:51.233 --> 19:52.843
Geez...

19:52.930 --> 19:55.106
I thought you were going to look
totally gay as a butterfly,

19:55.194 --> 19:56.673
but you look amazing.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.808
Harv?

20:00.895 --> 20:02.853
And Julio.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.420
I knew you'd be one
of the first.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.292
You were always
the head of the class.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.688
This is fantastic!

20:11.775 --> 20:14.474
Look at all of you guys.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.303
Wow.

20:17.390 --> 20:20.088
I forgot how many
of you there were.

20:20.175 --> 20:22.438
Okay.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.614
-That's a lot of fluttering
-[chuckling weakly]

20:24.701 --> 20:26.877
That's enough.

20:26.964 --> 20:29.619
[chuckling weakly]

20:30.881 --> 20:32.361
Get off of me.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.885
Get the hell off of me!

20:34.972 --> 20:37.192
[screaming]

20:43.242 --> 20:44.634
Good news.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.245
Wendy's restraining
order has been reduced

20:46.332 --> 20:47.376
from 100 feet to 50 feet.

20:47.463 --> 20:48.682
If I can yell
loud enough,

20:48.769 --> 20:50.858
I think I can
straighten this out.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.338
It's so good to
have you back.

20:52.425 --> 20:53.687
Oh. You coming home
for lunch?

20:53.774 --> 20:55.819
-Mm, and coffee break.
-Mm.

20:56.907 --> 20:57.778
[fluttering noise]

20:57.865 --> 20:58.953
[screaming]

20:59.040 --> 21:00.259
No, no!

21:01.999 --> 21:05.046
Okay, one more week, then
that joke's off limits.

21:44.564 --> 21:47.001
