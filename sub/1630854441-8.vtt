01:43.538 --> 01:45.279
Are you sure we shouldn't
take him to a hospital?

01:45.279 --> 01:47.368
According to Ada,
the only cure is magic,

01:47.368 --> 01:49.718
which is what the tea is for.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.157
You did it, Mary.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.593
You found him.

01:55.593 --> 01:56.681
We found him.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.771
Now that he's back, are you--

01:59.771 --> 02:01.512
are you out?

02:01.512 --> 02:03.514
I have to make sure
he's okay first--

02:03.514 --> 02:06.038
as much as I wanna sock him
as soon as we wakes up.

02:06.038 --> 02:08.302
Why?

02:08.302 --> 02:10.304
Are you trying to get
rid of me, Winchester?

02:12.654 --> 02:15.396
Well, this tea
is not gonna brew itself.

02:15.396 --> 02:17.137
I'll make some more.
- Thanks.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.666
I still can't believe
he did what he did.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.451
He busted in all guns
blazing with this thing.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.236
Mary...

02:29.236 --> 02:32.064
- Dad?
- I think I found a way.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.327
A way for what?

02:33.327 --> 02:35.503
To find the queen.

02:40.464 --> 02:41.770
A way to find the queen?

02:41.770 --> 02:43.902
Well, did Samuel
say anything else?

02:43.902 --> 02:46.209
No.
He passed out.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.906
What about you two?
You guys find anything?

02:47.906 --> 02:49.343
Nada.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.083
I mean, we've been
keeping our ears pressed

02:51.083 --> 02:53.390
at the police scanner,
but so far, it's been quiet.

02:53.390 --> 02:55.262
Like, the Akrida
have just disappeared.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.655
Well, it makes sense
that they'd be in retreat.

02:57.655 --> 02:58.743
We hit 'em pretty hard.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.310
We did find something else

03:00.310 --> 03:01.746
that was interesting.

03:01.746 --> 03:04.532
Um, reports of a musician
who burned up

03:04.532 --> 03:07.012
outside the Knave of Hearts
in Kansas City.

03:07.012 --> 03:10.015
All that was left of him was
a pile of ash and his guitar.

03:10.015 --> 03:12.235
The cops' best theory
is that he got lit up

03:12.235 --> 03:13.976
by an arcing power line.

03:13.976 --> 03:16.239
Is there a reason to believe
that's not what happened?

03:16.239 --> 03:18.198
Because you need
a power line to arc,

03:18.198 --> 03:19.721
and the closest one
is across the street

03:19.721 --> 03:22.158
from where he got zapped.
- Mm-hmm.

03:22.158 --> 03:24.595
The Knave of Hearts, why does
that sound so familiar?

03:24.595 --> 03:26.249
Because it is
one of the most famous

03:26.249 --> 03:28.251
underground clubs
in the Midwest.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.775
If you wanna make it in music,
you play the Knave.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.473
You all should
definitely check it out,

03:32.473 --> 03:35.171
but I'm gonna wait here
for when my dad wakes up.

03:35.171 --> 03:37.956
Maybe I'll stay too.

03:42.961 --> 03:44.354
I'll allow it.

03:44.354 --> 03:45.877
Lata, let's boogie.

03:50.273 --> 03:52.144
Have fun.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.375
<i>Being a hunter, it means
living a life of sacrifice--</i>

04:05.375 --> 04:08.073
<i>not a lot of room for dreams.</i>

04:08.073 --> 04:11.599
<i>But you open your heart
and get a little lucky,</i>

04:11.599 --> 04:13.731
<i>you'll find you gain
more than you lose.</i>

04:15.516 --> 04:16.908
What is that smell?

04:16.908 --> 04:19.520
Mmm, the smell of stars
being born.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.913
You sure it's not
stale beer and B.O.?

04:21.913 --> 04:24.438
Pay your respects, okay?
This is a cathedral.

04:24.438 --> 04:27.005
Yeah, that is not the word
I would've chosen.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.530
I'm gonna go distract
that sulking bartender--

04:29.530 --> 04:31.532
see if he can tell us anything
about our guy.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.708
Maybe you can go
to Brock's dressing room

04:33.708 --> 04:36.101
and see what you can find?

04:44.327 --> 04:46.024
What'll it be?

04:46.024 --> 04:48.810
Uh, rye whiskey, rocks.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.333
Uh, make it a double.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.699
I saw Brock's show
last night.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.268
I didn't know it would be
his last.

05:12.268 --> 05:15.358
The fragility of life, man...

05:15.358 --> 05:17.926
I don't know why
everyone that comes in here

05:17.926 --> 05:20.276
thinks I'm a shrink.

05:20.276 --> 05:22.626
If you wanna cry
about something...

05:24.454 --> 05:25.934
Cry into your glass.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.244
Nice to know
that the locals are mourning.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.076
Hello, Brock.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.390
<i>Please tell me
you found something.</i>

05:47.390 --> 05:49.305
<i>These were
on Brock's mirror.</i>

05:49.305 --> 05:50.785
They're protection sigils.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.700
If he was digging into this,

05:52.700 --> 05:55.311
then he knew he was in some
kind of paranormal danger.

05:55.311 --> 05:56.704
Could you tell
from the sigils

05:56.704 --> 05:57.879
what had him spooked?

05:57.879 --> 05:59.228
I'll have to check my books.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.838
Luckily, I brought some.

06:00.838 --> 06:03.145
You do realize
your mobile library

06:03.145 --> 06:05.190
has single-handedly destroyed
the shocks on my--

06:05.190 --> 06:07.932
Rivers Gemini?

06:07.932 --> 06:09.847
As I live and breathe!

06:09.847 --> 06:12.023
- Oh, my God!
- Come here, hey.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.590
Oh, it's--what the hell
are you doing here?

06:13.590 --> 06:16.767
Jericho, I could ask you
the same question.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.030
Uh, actually, I'm headlining.

06:19.030 --> 06:20.684
You're--you're headlining

06:20.684 --> 06:22.425
here at the Knave of Hearts?

06:22.425 --> 06:25.385
Yeah, lots of changes
since we saw each other.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.951
Who's, uh, who's your friend?

06:26.951 --> 06:30.259
Hi, I'm Lata,
and you're clearly Jericho,

06:30.259 --> 06:33.044
but, I'm sorry,
who is Rivers Gemini?

06:33.044 --> 06:35.264
No one.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.353
- She doesn't know?
- No, she does--she doesn't.

06:37.353 --> 06:38.963
The old stage name

06:38.963 --> 06:40.922
for this dulcet-toned crooner.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.619
- Ah.
- We had a two piece.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.926
It was "Rivers Gemini
and The Jericho Kid."

06:44.926 --> 06:46.797
And you do not
get to call me that.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.625
Oh, whatever you say,

06:48.625 --> 06:49.931
Rivers Gemini.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.717
Um, I'm glad
that you stuck with it.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.545
How's the tour going?

06:55.545 --> 06:58.200
Yeah, I mean,
it was roses until last night.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.289
I mean,
did you hear what happened?

07:00.289 --> 07:01.421
- Yes.
- Yeah.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.292
Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

07:03.292 --> 07:04.989
It was horrible.

07:04.989 --> 07:08.253
Well, perhaps you'd like
to join us for a drink?

07:08.253 --> 07:10.081
It's the least we could do.

07:10.081 --> 07:11.648
Yeah, yeah.

07:11.648 --> 07:12.823
Okay.

07:12.823 --> 07:13.911
Come on, Rivers.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.874
So Ada's magic tea

07:19.874 --> 07:22.659
is just a bunch
of sticks and leaves?

07:22.659 --> 07:25.096
Well, the healing power
of plants, I guess.

07:25.096 --> 07:27.621
I'm just following
the recipe she gave me.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.753
Well, whatever it is,
it's working.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.189
His fever's down.

07:31.189 --> 07:33.583
Good.
Well, let's keep it coming.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.846
Why don't you take
a moment for yourselves?

07:41.243 --> 07:42.897
What happened
got me thinking

07:42.897 --> 07:47.075
about the Cuban Missile Crisis.

07:47.075 --> 07:51.035
Uh, I assume the Akrida are
Khrushchevs in this scenario?

07:52.428 --> 07:54.212
In 'Nam,
some of the older guys,

07:54.212 --> 07:56.432
they would tell stories
about how everybody thought

07:56.432 --> 07:57.781
that they were gonna die.

07:57.781 --> 08:00.523
So they would do
all kinds of crazy stuff,

08:00.523 --> 08:02.786
like get drunk

08:02.786 --> 08:05.963
and boost cars,
just 'cause they thought

08:05.963 --> 08:07.965
they didn't have to live
with the consequences.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.793
Mm.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.403
Are you saying
we should've boosted a car

08:11.403 --> 08:13.493
while we had the chance?

08:15.712 --> 08:19.368
I'm saying that...

08:19.368 --> 08:22.806
our kiss,
it wasn't that for me.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.767
I wanna live
with the consequences

08:26.767 --> 08:30.335
and I hope that you do too.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.645
I don't regret
what happened.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.781
But with everything going on,

08:40.781 --> 08:44.045
and now my dad being back, I...

08:44.045 --> 08:47.004
I'm not sure
what I'm ready for.

08:47.004 --> 08:50.225
So I--I just need time.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.575
Of course.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.011
Yeah.

08:57.711 --> 09:00.583
Oh, God.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.759
This is the greatest photo
I have ever seen.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.244
We really were something, huh?

09:09.244 --> 09:10.941
Yep, I wish
you would've stuck around.

09:10.941 --> 09:13.901
I mean, the stages I have
played the last few weeks,

09:13.901 --> 09:15.293
I mean, whoo!
- Nah, no, no, no, no.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.339
The fame would've gone
to my head.

09:17.339 --> 09:19.950
Mm-hmm, yeah, like anything
could inflate this ego more.

09:22.605 --> 09:26.217
So was Brock a replacement
for Rivers?

09:26.217 --> 09:28.306
No,
nobody could replace Rivers.

09:28.306 --> 09:29.612
He could make
an entire room weep

09:29.612 --> 09:30.657
with three chords
and the truth.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.049
Notice how he doesn't say

09:32.049 --> 09:33.573
why they were weeping.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.794
Yeah, Brock was no Rivers.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.927
It was a real shame
what happened to him though.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.972
They're saying
it was an accident.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.974
Yeah, I was on stage
when it happened,

09:43.974 --> 09:46.150
so I didn't really
see anything.

09:48.239 --> 09:50.067
Oh, you know what?
I gotta, um,

09:50.067 --> 09:51.808
I gotta go talk to the band.

09:51.808 --> 09:55.116
But listen, um,

09:55.116 --> 09:56.552
come to the show tonight.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.554
It would mean a lot to me,
all right?

09:58.554 --> 10:00.208
And we can catch up after.
- Yeah, um,

10:00.208 --> 10:01.557
I--I don't think
we'll have time.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.472
Just hang onto 'em.

10:03.472 --> 10:04.995
Just in case, okay?

10:06.562 --> 10:11.132
Well, he is
a ray of sunshine.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.090
Yeah, well,
I've had enough sun for today.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.615
So, um, Jericho might
not have all the answers,

10:15.615 --> 10:18.313
but those sigils
you have might.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.666
Oh, um, sorry.

10:23.666 --> 10:24.711
Um...

10:26.713 --> 10:28.845
Nice chapeau, by the way.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.413
Um, hope I didn't scuff it.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.678
Not at all, mon amí.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.549
You two kids have a fun night.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.258
Brock was thorough.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.129
Each of these sigils
is from a different culture,

10:52.129 --> 10:56.220
but the purpose is the same--
protection from dark magic.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.266
So we're looking
for a dark magic wielder

10:58.266 --> 11:00.790
from we don't know where.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.271
Really narrows it down.

11:03.271 --> 11:05.621
You sure you don't want
to go to the show tonight?

11:05.621 --> 11:07.144
Positive.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.580
It's like looking
in a funhouse mirror

11:08.580 --> 11:09.581
of what my life could've been,

11:09.581 --> 11:11.932
so no, thank you.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.977
You miss it, don't you?

11:13.977 --> 11:15.587
A part of me does.

11:15.587 --> 11:16.763
But it was never gonna work.

11:16.763 --> 11:17.894
You're on the road for so long,

11:17.894 --> 11:19.200
it's a matter of time

11:19.200 --> 11:20.418
before you come
across a monster,

11:20.418 --> 11:22.725
and then something has to die--

11:22.725 --> 11:24.684
the dream

11:24.684 --> 11:26.642
or the monster.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.343
I have an idea.

11:32.343 --> 11:34.041
Roadies see all,
and better yet,

11:34.041 --> 11:36.086
have an opinion on everything.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.829
Hey, um, you need a hand?

11:39.829 --> 11:41.788
Beat it, kid.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.183
Sorry, uh,

11:46.183 --> 11:47.663
after what went down
last night--

11:47.663 --> 11:50.057
I've been all over the place.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.320
Thanks for the assist.
- Yeah--last night?

11:52.320 --> 11:55.323
Um, you mean
what happened to Brock?

11:56.977 --> 11:58.369
Never mind.

11:58.369 --> 12:01.068
Forget it.
- No, he--

12:01.068 --> 12:03.070
he was our friend.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.899
We're not sure
we buy the official story.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.857
When we talked to him
last night,

12:07.857 --> 12:09.554
he sounded paranoid,

12:09.554 --> 12:12.209
like someone was following him.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.820
Look, you didn't
hear this from me,

12:13.820 --> 12:16.561
but fans have been
following us--

12:16.561 --> 12:18.825
obsessed with the musicians.
- And let me guess.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.348
The feeling wasn't mutual.

12:20.348 --> 12:21.915
Bingo.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.655
He was at Brock's set.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.657
When it ended,
he followed him out.

12:25.657 --> 12:27.311
What did he look like?

12:27.311 --> 12:28.791
About yea high,

12:28.791 --> 12:31.968
had a cool hat
with a feather in it.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.754
Anyway, I gotta get back to it.
Thanks again.

12:38.061 --> 12:40.542
He was there, the guy
that I bumped into at the bar.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.588
What if
he's targeting singers?

12:43.588 --> 12:45.895
Then Jericho could be next.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.425
Who are you, and what
are you doing in my house?

12:54.425 --> 12:56.819
Millie Winchester.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.169
You saved my son's life.

12:59.169 --> 13:01.868
The boy with Mary.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.521
Ugh, whatever that is,

13:03.521 --> 13:04.784
you can pour it down the drain.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.524
Doctor's orders.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.091
Doctor who?

13:08.091 --> 13:09.745
Ada.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.703
She also said to get some rest

13:11.703 --> 13:13.096
and not to be a jackass.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.794
Her words.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.841
That sounds like Ada.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.756
Where is she?

13:20.756 --> 13:22.236
Trying to find
some kind of magic

13:22.236 --> 13:24.542
to kill these
human-sized cockroaches,

13:24.542 --> 13:27.241
now that the Monster Box
got destroyed.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.547
Where's Mary?

13:29.547 --> 13:31.462
Taking a beat.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.378
Yeah.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.859
That daughter of yours
is a good kid--

13:36.859 --> 13:39.644
been teaching John
his way around hunting,

13:39.644 --> 13:42.169
much as I don't like
the danger it puts him in,

13:42.169 --> 13:44.693
I think
it's actually good for him.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.651
Well, fighting monsters
isn't for everyone.

13:46.651 --> 13:47.870
Mm.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.480
The only thing I like fighting

13:49.480 --> 13:51.613
is the wear and tear
on a timing belt.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.181
I'm a mechanic.

13:54.181 --> 13:55.660
- Oh.
- I've had the bad luck

13:55.660 --> 13:59.142
of marrying
into this craziness.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.970
If your husband's a hunter,
you thought I'd heard of him.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.885
Before he died,

14:02.885 --> 14:04.626
he was a Men of Letters.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.628
You mean to tell me

14:06.628 --> 14:09.022
that my daughter's
teaching family secrets

14:09.022 --> 14:10.893
to the son of a mole man?

14:10.893 --> 14:12.677
A mole man?

14:12.677 --> 14:13.940
Men of Letters,

14:13.940 --> 14:15.463
M-O-L--

14:15.463 --> 14:17.508
buried underground
with all their books,

14:17.508 --> 14:19.902
while hunters are out there
getting their hands dirty--

14:19.902 --> 14:21.556
or worse.

14:23.036 --> 14:25.299
Well, enjoy the tea.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.216
And for the record,

14:29.216 --> 14:31.958
if it wasn't for my mole man
of a husband,

14:31.958 --> 14:34.308
you, your daughter, and my son

14:34.308 --> 14:36.353
would all be dead right now.

14:42.403 --> 14:43.752
Uh,
for anybody out there tonight

14:43.752 --> 14:45.058
going through hard times,

14:45.058 --> 14:47.103
this next one's for you.

14:50.106 --> 14:56.373
♪ Let us pause
in life's pleasures ♪

14:56.373 --> 14:58.636
♪ And count its many tears

14:58.636 --> 15:04.207

15:15.131 --> 15:17.003
♪ 'Tis the song

15:17.003 --> 15:21.311

15:44.639 --> 15:46.641
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Hey.

15:51.385 --> 15:52.864
Oh, sorry.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.475
I--I thought
you were someone else.

15:56.564 --> 15:58.131
If you wanted
to join me on stage,

15:58.131 --> 15:59.219
all you had to do--
all you had to do was ask.

15:59.219 --> 16:00.655
My mistake.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.265
I thought I saw
a light coming down

16:02.265 --> 16:05.399
from the rafters, all right?

16:19.065 --> 16:21.154
I never took my eyes
off of him.

16:21.154 --> 16:23.504
But then he was
just someone else.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.029
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

16:56.189 --> 16:57.538
Going somewhere?

16:57.538 --> 16:59.235
Hell yeah--
anywhere but here.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.281
Jericho,

17:01.281 --> 17:02.499
we're on your side here.

17:02.499 --> 17:05.024
You can talk to us.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.547
You're not gonna believe me.

17:06.547 --> 17:10.116
I had to go solo,
and then things took a turn.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.508
What do you mean?

17:11.508 --> 17:13.206
Nobody wants
to hear Jericho Kid

17:13.206 --> 17:16.078
without Rivers Gemini, 'kay?

17:16.078 --> 17:18.385
But things changed
a few weeks ago.

17:18.385 --> 17:19.995
What happened?

17:19.995 --> 17:22.128
I was playing this dive bar
at Nashville.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.825
There was a suit.

17:23.825 --> 17:26.045
He bought me a couple drinks
after the show,

17:26.045 --> 17:29.091
and then he asked me
what I would give

17:29.091 --> 17:31.789
to have the kind of music
that shook people's souls.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.575
And how did you
seal the deal?

17:34.575 --> 17:37.882
Well, the rest of the night
was kind of blurry.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.841
But the next morning,
I woke up with this.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.799
I mean, that night,

17:41.799 --> 17:44.411
I played the same set.

17:44.411 --> 17:47.936
This woman, she looked at me
like I was the second coming,

17:47.936 --> 17:49.503
and it was--

17:49.503 --> 17:51.853
it was intoxicating.

17:51.853 --> 17:54.116
And then she burned.

17:54.116 --> 17:56.684
I didn't--
I didn't put it together

17:56.684 --> 17:59.121
until it happened again.

17:59.121 --> 18:02.255
And I was done singing
in Nashville,

18:02.255 --> 18:05.562
But the tattoo...

18:05.562 --> 18:07.347
I mean, he said
if I don't sing to someone,

18:07.347 --> 18:09.610
then it'll burn me up instead.

18:09.610 --> 18:12.613
And then Brock figured out
what you were doing.

18:12.613 --> 18:15.659
That's why he surrounded
himself with the sigils--

18:15.659 --> 18:17.487
for protection.

18:17.487 --> 18:20.403
He wanted me to cut him in.

18:20.403 --> 18:22.362
I had to nip it in the bud,

18:22.362 --> 18:24.973
but that bartender--
okay, I don't know.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.322
That must've backfired
or something.

18:26.322 --> 18:29.369
That is not
who I was singing to.

18:29.369 --> 18:32.850
- Then who?
- That suit from Nashville.

18:32.850 --> 18:35.462
He called himself Loki.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.768
Loki?

18:37.768 --> 18:40.423
As in the Norse trickster
demigod, Loki?

18:40.423 --> 18:42.251
That--that Loki?

18:42.251 --> 18:44.514
How is none of this
fazing you?

18:44.514 --> 18:47.213
You asked me why
I walked away.

18:47.213 --> 18:50.172
Helping people with weirdness
like this is why.

18:54.611 --> 18:56.570
Mm.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.445
Dad, you should lay down.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.665
I'll lay down when I'm dead.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.581
Oh, right.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.498
You must be John.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.326
Yes, sir.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.023
Yeah, I wanted to thank you.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.894
Save it, save it. I know.
I saved your skin.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.418
But tell me something.

19:18.418 --> 19:19.941
I heard your dad
was Men of Letters.

19:19.941 --> 19:22.596
Hey, give John
the third degree later.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.380
I wanna hear about
this Akrida Queen.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.165
You said you know
where to find her.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.297
Get my bag.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.038
I was searching
for the queen's burial site

19:30.038 --> 19:31.605
when they found me.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.824
She's the key
to their whole damn invasion.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.348
How?

19:35.348 --> 19:37.306
I wish I knew, but I don't--

19:37.306 --> 19:38.307
well, not yet.

19:38.307 --> 19:39.743
So how did you even get

19:39.743 --> 19:41.528
on the Akrida's track
to begin with?

19:41.528 --> 19:43.007
When you've been hunting
for more than five minutes,

19:43.007 --> 19:45.053
you make contacts,
and you hear things.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.534
I caught wind of a sighting
a few months back--

19:47.534 --> 19:49.536
matched the description
of the Akrida,

19:49.536 --> 19:51.755
along with information
about the weapons,

19:51.755 --> 19:53.104
so I--

19:53.104 --> 19:54.149
I ran 'em down.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.498
Alone,

19:55.498 --> 19:57.457
without telling me.

19:57.457 --> 19:58.936
John, why don't you
go sharpen some stakes

19:58.936 --> 20:00.068
and give us a second here?

20:00.068 --> 20:02.026
- Yup.
- No.

20:02.026 --> 20:04.507
Anything you can say to me,
you can say to John too.

20:04.507 --> 20:07.249
Start by telling us
about the queen.

20:13.037 --> 20:15.039
Everything points
to the queen's burial site

20:15.039 --> 20:17.912
being at
one of these locations.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.218
These recon photos?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.654
Yeah, we study those photos,

20:20.654 --> 20:22.221
we can find out
where she's hiding.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.962
Let's go set up
the darkroom.

20:24.962 --> 20:26.137
Mare--

20:28.749 --> 20:32.274
I know I've only been hunting
for five minutes,

20:32.274 --> 20:35.408
but she hasn't slept a good
night since you've been gone.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.061
Least you could do is treat her
more like a daughter

20:37.061 --> 20:39.150
and less like a soldier.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.156
He's a trickster, right?

20:45.156 --> 20:46.810
So he could be hiding anywhere
and look like anyone.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.421
Explains how he got away--

20:48.421 --> 20:50.249
probably just shape-shifted
into someone else.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.989
Well, let's just hope
that one of your books

20:51.989 --> 20:54.253
has the trick to see
through his smoke and mirrors.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.821
I know what you're thinking.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.997
What a twist!

21:02.217 --> 21:06.090
I must say, Jericho,
you were right about this one.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.571
He's got pluck.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.052
Er--

21:11.052 --> 21:13.837
Jerri didn't mention that, uh,

21:13.837 --> 21:16.100
he and I, we...

21:16.100 --> 21:18.189
Wow, um,

21:18.189 --> 21:20.322
I guess I know why
the band broke up.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.584
Carlos, I'm sorry.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.586
You set us up?

21:23.586 --> 21:25.153
He did--

21:25.153 --> 21:27.286
little addendum
to the contract I threw in

21:27.286 --> 21:30.637
just to spice things up--
an exit clause, if you will.

21:30.637 --> 21:33.248
But I always make a point

21:33.248 --> 21:35.859
to get to know
the new talent firsthand

21:35.859 --> 21:38.340
before I make a deal.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.690
I was skeptical at first.

21:40.690 --> 21:43.998
Seeing you up close
won me over.

21:43.998 --> 21:45.478
I'm not making
a deal with you.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.088
Hm.

21:48.698 --> 21:52.180
Oh, my sweet,
little summer child,

21:52.180 --> 21:56.227
you will
if you wanna save Jericho.

21:56.227 --> 21:57.577
You know,

21:57.577 --> 21:59.796
you have
a very impressive résumé.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.191
"Love of modern dance."
Useless.

22:03.191 --> 22:05.759
"Gifted typist."
Now that's a skill.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.675
"Musician, hunter, hair model."
Samesies.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.329
But what I don't see here

22:10.329 --> 22:13.506
is somebody
who will just walk away.

22:18.641 --> 22:21.252
We're nodding, we're nodding,
but we're not speaking.

22:21.252 --> 22:23.080
You gotta say the words, kid.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.386
Them's the rules.

22:24.386 --> 22:25.953
Carlos,
you don't have to do this.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.433
I don't recall asking you.

22:32.481 --> 22:33.961
You have a deal.

22:33.961 --> 22:35.441
Atta hippie!

22:35.441 --> 22:36.746
Let's tango.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.105
Am I free now?

22:48.105 --> 22:50.020
Oh, as a matter of fact--

22:50.020 --> 22:52.371
What did you do to him?

22:52.371 --> 22:54.373
Oh, please, nobody cares--
at least, I don't.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.505
He's like a security deposit.
Move on from that.

22:56.505 --> 22:57.854
Let's focus on you.

22:57.854 --> 22:59.508
Here's the lowdown.

22:59.508 --> 23:03.556
Song by sunup,
or things are gonna get toasty.

23:06.341 --> 23:07.386
Toodles.

23:14.262 --> 23:16.090
One night only.

23:16.090 --> 23:18.397
Okay,
so you sing a song tonight,

23:18.397 --> 23:21.400
someone burns,
and then the curse is lifted?

23:21.400 --> 23:22.618
That's the gist of it.

23:22.618 --> 23:23.706
Can't we just
figure out a way

23:23.706 --> 23:25.055
to remove the tattoo?

23:25.055 --> 23:26.883
If it was weaker magic, perhaps.

23:26.883 --> 23:28.494
But a demigod like Loki,

23:28.494 --> 23:30.626
defeating him is the only way
to save Carlos.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.542
Maggie's books--

23:33.542 --> 23:35.979
her lore on gods and demigods.

23:35.979 --> 23:38.286
Surely there's something
in there about Loki.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.331
All right.

23:40.331 --> 23:42.682
I'll start over here
and we'll see...

23:42.682 --> 23:45.467
Okay, what is it called?

23:46.860 --> 23:48.557
What are you thinking?

23:48.557 --> 23:52.692
I'm thinking that a lot more
changed than I realized.

23:52.692 --> 23:54.258
When I first met Carlos,

23:54.258 --> 23:56.086
he was a feral kid
with a knack for hunting

23:56.086 --> 23:58.524
and getting into trouble,
and Lata, she was terrified.

23:58.524 --> 24:01.570
She was, um, content
to read about what we do

24:01.570 --> 24:03.616
in the safety of the library.

24:03.616 --> 24:05.487
It's only been a few months
since I've seen them,

24:05.487 --> 24:07.489
but now look at 'em.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.404
Well,
it's all because of Mary.

24:09.404 --> 24:10.840
She brought us together.

24:10.840 --> 24:14.235
She didn't get that from me.

24:14.235 --> 24:15.802
Hey, guys, monsters that kill--

24:17.194 --> 24:18.979
To feed and survive
are one thing.

24:18.979 --> 24:21.242
Ones that kill for kicks--

24:21.242 --> 24:23.766
we're in for a fight.

24:23.766 --> 24:27.466
Okay, weird sensation,
but contemplating my mortality

24:27.466 --> 24:29.424
has surprisingly
made me hungry.

24:29.424 --> 24:30.991
Read this for me,
and I'll make you

24:30.991 --> 24:33.472
one of my family specials.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.603
I don't...

24:38.868 --> 24:40.174
What's the family special?

24:45.266 --> 24:46.572
You know, I always imagined

24:46.572 --> 24:48.574
my last supper
would be on a yacht

24:48.574 --> 24:50.619
in the middle
of the Mediterranean

24:50.619 --> 24:54.101
on the lam with my lover
after a heist gone wrong.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.843
I think I found something.

24:56.843 --> 24:59.323
"Loki's magic is tied
to a powerful symbol

24:59.323 --> 25:00.629
"of misdirection and trickery

25:00.629 --> 25:02.152
"that he carries with him--

25:02.152 --> 25:03.502
a hand mirror."

25:03.502 --> 25:05.242
So what's the plan?

25:05.242 --> 25:06.592
Smash the mirror,
no more curse?

25:06.592 --> 25:08.202
No,
the mirror's indestructible,

25:08.202 --> 25:10.334
but there might be
another way to kill Loki--

25:10.334 --> 25:12.902
"using a reflective blade
like the mirror

25:12.902 --> 25:16.297
that's been enchanted
using a warrior's own blood."

25:16.297 --> 25:17.559
Reflective like this?

25:22.695 --> 25:24.392
Are we ready?

25:27.221 --> 25:28.875
Dad, what are you doing?

25:28.875 --> 25:30.267
There's a monster out there
that needs hunting.

25:30.267 --> 25:31.704
Let's go hunt.

25:31.704 --> 25:33.227
No, you're in
no condition for this.

25:33.227 --> 25:35.490
I'm going.

25:35.490 --> 25:37.579
Can we talk for a second?

25:43.454 --> 25:45.282
You don't get to do this.

25:45.282 --> 25:47.067
I taught you how to hunt.
I don't need your permiss--

25:47.067 --> 25:49.069
You can't disappear
and then waltz back in here

25:49.069 --> 25:50.592
and pretend like
nothing ever happened.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.289
I know that I owe you
an explanation.

25:52.289 --> 25:53.813
That's why I tried
to talk to you earlier.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.641
Why didn't you tell me
where you were going?

25:55.641 --> 25:56.946
About the Akrida?

25:56.946 --> 25:58.731
- Mary--
- You left me in the dark!

25:58.731 --> 26:00.384
What gives you the right?

26:00.384 --> 26:02.343
'Cause you're
a stubborn jackass!

26:06.782 --> 26:08.697
Just like me.

26:08.697 --> 26:10.264
Had I told you
what I was doing,

26:10.264 --> 26:11.744
I know you would've
charged in headfirst.

26:11.744 --> 26:15.835
I did everything I could
to get you off my trail,

26:15.835 --> 26:18.098
because I couldn't--I--I...

26:20.230 --> 26:24.452
I can't let you turn out
like Maggie.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.802
You could've been anything,
Mary, anything.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.022
But when I put that knife
in your hands,

26:29.022 --> 26:30.589
I chose this life for you.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.547
I forced you to follow
in my footsteps,

26:32.547 --> 26:34.723
just like my dad forced me.

26:34.723 --> 26:37.857
It was wrong.

26:37.857 --> 26:41.121
I don't want you to hate me
like I hated him.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.777
- Dad...
- I heard tall tales

26:44.777 --> 26:46.039
of an Oppenheimer--
someone who found a way

26:46.039 --> 26:48.215
to nuke
all these damn monsters,

26:48.215 --> 26:52.393
so that you could be free
of all of this--forever.

26:52.393 --> 26:54.264
But you found
the Akrida instead.

26:57.267 --> 27:01.184
I can't give you back
all those years.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.839
But I'm your dad.
I have to try.

27:38.308 --> 27:40.180
He's not here.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.095
Then where is he?

27:44.663 --> 27:47.056
Oh, goodie.

27:47.056 --> 27:49.189
Brought your own adoring fans.

27:49.189 --> 27:50.843
I was secretly
hoping you would.

27:50.843 --> 27:52.061
You know,
I booked this whole place

27:52.061 --> 27:53.541
just for you--

27:53.541 --> 27:56.065
not cheap,
but you're worth it.

27:56.065 --> 27:57.197
Now...

27:59.199 --> 28:00.504
What'll you have?

28:02.419 --> 28:04.421
Dirty blades.

28:04.421 --> 28:06.119
Dirty pool.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.774
How about we even these odds?

28:40.631 --> 28:41.894

29:08.921 --> 29:11.140
I'm not falling for

29:17.451 --> 29:19.627
Darn.

29:19.627 --> 29:21.760
You got me.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.502
How did you know
it wasn't me?

29:25.502 --> 29:27.200
I found his tell.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.854
You're not left-handed.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.116
I know my daughter.

29:33.859 --> 29:36.426
Oh, wow.

29:37.906 --> 29:38.994
Whew!

29:40.430 --> 29:42.693
Is it dusty in here,
or is it just me?

29:42.693 --> 29:45.435
That was--wait--

29:47.611 --> 29:51.093
That was a beautiful
father-daughter moment.

29:51.093 --> 29:52.529
I mean--

29:52.529 --> 29:54.053
No notes.

29:56.055 --> 29:57.273
No...

29:57.273 --> 29:58.666
Oh, yeah!

29:58.666 --> 30:00.363
After all,
every great trickster--

30:00.363 --> 30:02.061
and of course,
I am the greatest trickster--

30:02.061 --> 30:04.628
has to have at least
one last one up their sleeve.

30:04.628 --> 30:06.369
You should be dead.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.937
Oh, for the brains
of this operation,

30:08.937 --> 30:11.505
you are not
the smartest cookie.

30:11.505 --> 30:13.115
Cookies aren't smart
to start with.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.813
Think on that.
Take a look-see

30:14.813 --> 30:16.684
at the translation
of the incantation.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.904
Oh, it's a hoot.

30:22.385 --> 30:24.648
- Let us go.
- Zip it.

30:24.648 --> 30:26.259
For someone your height,
you're very loud.

30:26.259 --> 30:27.260
Mm!

30:27.260 --> 30:28.522
Mm...

30:33.440 --> 30:35.703
All right, music man,

30:35.703 --> 30:37.400
time's almost up.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.620
Thought about
who you're serenading?

30:39.620 --> 30:40.839
I made it easy.

30:43.363 --> 30:44.407
What did you do to him?

30:44.407 --> 30:47.628
Oh, come on, man.

30:47.628 --> 30:50.892
Don't get all high and mighty
on me now.

30:52.546 --> 30:56.289
You sacrificed everything
to be a hunter

30:56.289 --> 31:00.597
so broken people like Jericho
can live?

31:00.597 --> 31:02.599
Come on, man!

31:02.599 --> 31:05.080
Clock in, Carlos!

31:05.080 --> 31:08.083
Why should you pay
for what he did, hmm?

31:10.085 --> 31:12.087
Yeah.

31:12.087 --> 31:13.915
That's right.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.483
Exactly.

31:16.483 --> 31:19.181
Go ahead, champ.

31:19.181 --> 31:22.054
Let's hear those dulcet tones.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.925
Jericho's waiting.

31:35.632 --> 31:38.113
Groovy--an acoustic jam.

31:43.466 --> 31:45.164
I like the buildup.
Very dramatic.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.513
It's gonna be great.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.139
That was a rental!

32:04.139 --> 32:06.794
You're right.

32:06.794 --> 32:10.276
I did sacrifice everything
for hunting.

32:10.276 --> 32:12.234
But I got so much more
out of it

32:12.234 --> 32:15.324
than I could've imagined
in exchange.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.981
I won't play your game.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.113
That's stupid.

32:54.755 --> 32:56.409
This!

32:56.409 --> 32:58.411
Isn't happening!

32:58.411 --> 32:59.803
Ah!

32:59.803 --> 33:01.892
When the chips are down,

33:01.892 --> 33:04.983
humanity always chooses
the selfish way out!

33:04.983 --> 33:06.680
Always!

33:06.680 --> 33:10.379
And you--you are the portrait
of bad choices!

33:10.379 --> 33:15.384
I am not gonna lose to you!

33:20.389 --> 33:22.391
No, no, no, no, no.

33:25.307 --> 33:26.613
You son of a--

33:34.577 --> 33:36.405
- Is this a trick?
<i>- Great.</i>

33:36.405 --> 33:38.407
<i>Thanks for nothing,
Carlos!</i>

33:38.407 --> 33:40.801
Did you know
that was gonna work?

33:40.801 --> 33:42.803
No, I--

33:42.803 --> 33:44.109
I didn't.

33:45.849 --> 33:48.765
<i>Hey, easy, manicure.
I can feel that.</i>

33:48.765 --> 33:50.506
This must be the price
Loki has to pay

33:50.506 --> 33:52.247
for losing the game--

33:52.247 --> 33:53.683
to be trapped inside

33:53.683 --> 33:56.643
the indestructible source
of his power.

33:56.643 --> 33:59.254
Did you really mean
what you said?

34:00.951 --> 34:03.563
Every word.

34:03.563 --> 34:06.131
You guys...

34:06.131 --> 34:08.176
you guys are my family.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.662
<i>Stop tapping me.</i>

34:15.662 --> 34:16.837
<i>I said stop.</i>

34:25.454 --> 34:28.805
Where are you headed with
that useless piece of junk?

34:28.805 --> 34:30.981
Figured I'd fix old cars.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.592
Maybe I can fix it too--

34:32.592 --> 34:35.029
make that dream of yours
for Mary,

34:35.029 --> 34:36.944
a world without monsters,
a reality.

34:36.944 --> 34:38.641
It's worth kicking its tires

34:38.641 --> 34:40.861
one more time, don't you think?

34:40.861 --> 34:43.951
I've known you long enough to
know you're not really asking.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.779
Listen, um,

34:45.779 --> 34:48.912
thank you for helping
take care of me, Millie,

34:48.912 --> 34:51.915
and, uh,
for raising a good kid,

34:51.915 --> 34:53.526
even if he is a son of a mole.

34:55.615 --> 34:57.486
Take care of yourself, Samuel.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.625
Mom!

35:05.625 --> 35:08.193
Hey, Dad, um, John and I
developed the photos,

35:08.193 --> 35:10.847
but I don't think
you're gonna be happy.

35:10.847 --> 35:12.545
Light leaks on all of 'em?

35:12.545 --> 35:13.937
The camera
must've gotten damaged,

35:13.937 --> 35:15.243
but we can go back
to the location,

35:15.243 --> 35:16.810
check 'em out together.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.899
I'm gonna have to leave that
to you and John.

35:18.899 --> 35:20.640
Why?

35:20.640 --> 35:22.163
Ada called.
She's got the lead

35:22.163 --> 35:24.426
on some magic that might
help us defeat the queen.

35:24.426 --> 35:26.124
So you're going with her
to run it down.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.908
Listen, after seeing you
and your team in action--

35:29.736 --> 35:31.955
It's clear you don't need
your old man hanging around.

35:31.955 --> 35:34.262
Besides, what's the point
in finding the queen

35:34.262 --> 35:35.655
if we can't stop her

35:35.655 --> 35:37.787
and the rest of the Akrida, right?

35:37.787 --> 35:39.137
Speaking of which...

35:41.051 --> 35:43.141
Listen,

35:43.141 --> 35:45.273
I want you to follow
this pattern, okay?

35:45.273 --> 35:46.883
Use those ingredients
for the ink.

35:46.883 --> 35:50.148
It's a tattoo you can put
anywhere on your body.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.193
Look.

35:52.193 --> 35:55.196
The Akrida can't possess you
if it's on your skin.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.198
You better keep in touch.

35:57.198 --> 35:59.244
Who's the parent here?

35:59.244 --> 36:00.506
Don't worry.

36:00.506 --> 36:01.898
This time, I will.
I promise.

36:01.898 --> 36:02.986
All right?

36:04.249 --> 36:05.859
You two take care
of each other.

36:05.859 --> 36:08.078
Of course, Mr. Campbell.

36:08.078 --> 36:10.037
Samuel's fine.

36:11.473 --> 36:12.692
Thanks, Sam.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.694
Samuel is fine.

36:14.694 --> 36:16.913
Right.
Ah.

36:16.913 --> 36:20.178
All right, well, there's
only one thing I'm missing.

36:22.310 --> 36:24.094
Was on the road.
I lost my hat.

36:24.094 --> 36:26.009
Oh, Mary found it, actually.

36:26.009 --> 36:28.577
Well, then she lost it again.
Technically, she destroyed it.

36:28.577 --> 36:30.971
Um, it's a long story.
Hold on.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.374
I'm gonna turn myself in.

36:42.374 --> 36:44.767
Mm, that won't end
with you in prison

36:44.767 --> 36:46.943
if that's what
you're aiming for--

36:46.943 --> 36:49.468
an institution, probably.

36:49.468 --> 36:50.469
They can put me

36:50.469 --> 36:51.905
wherever they like.

36:51.905 --> 36:53.559
I deserve it.

36:53.559 --> 36:55.648
Can I give you some advice?

36:55.648 --> 36:58.390
You can't change
what's happened,

36:58.390 --> 37:01.436
but you can still
put some good in this world.

37:01.436 --> 37:04.744
I'm never gonna play again.

37:04.744 --> 37:07.007
You have a gift

37:07.007 --> 37:10.184
and an eye for talent,
so use it.

37:10.184 --> 37:11.794
I mean, come on,
that's not enough.

37:11.794 --> 37:15.058
Maybe not.

37:15.058 --> 37:17.017
But it's a start.

37:21.195 --> 37:23.589
Hey, listen, um,

37:23.589 --> 37:25.330
there might not be
much of a crowd tonight,

37:25.330 --> 37:28.594
you know,
given what's going on, but...

37:28.594 --> 37:32.250
I begged the manager to let
my band play one more night.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.469
Gonna need a singer.

37:34.469 --> 37:36.079
Come on, you deserve
to be up on that stage.

37:36.079 --> 37:37.820
No, no, no, no, no--

37:37.820 --> 37:40.214
Even if it is
just one night only.

37:40.214 --> 37:43.870
Come on.
What do you say?

37:49.179 --> 37:50.355
Whoo!

37:50.355 --> 37:52.705
Play some Sabbath!

37:53.706 --> 37:55.447
What?

37:55.447 --> 37:57.579
I'm more of a metal gal
than all that folk stuff,

37:57.579 --> 38:00.060
to be honest.

38:03.803 --> 38:05.631
This one's for my family.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.763

<i>Go, Losi!</i>

41:01.371 --> 41:03.548
I don't understand.

41:06.246 --> 41:09.075
I don't want to think
about the Akrida,

41:09.075 --> 41:12.426
whether the world has a future.

41:12.426 --> 41:14.733
I wanna be with you.

41:14.733 --> 41:17.518
Right here.
Right now.

41:24.133 --> 41:25.657
That's not possible.

41:25.657 --> 41:27.180
What?

41:28.311 --> 41:31.184
I know this guy.

41:31.184 --> 41:32.533
This is the guy
that gave me my dad's letter

41:32.533 --> 41:35.275
when I got back from Vietnam.

41:35.275 --> 41:37.277
Do you know him?

41:37.277 --> 41:39.584
No.

41:39.584 --> 41:40.672
Then how is he
in the background

41:40.672 --> 41:43.457
of one of your dad's photos?

41:43.457 --> 41:46.199
I don't know.

41:46.199 --> 41:47.809
Who the hell is this guy?
