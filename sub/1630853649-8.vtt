05:19.153 --> 05:21.405
You're just drawing

05:22.489 --> 05:25.284
Now, in your story,
you refer to a shell company,

Oberon Analytics, and you imply

05:30.914 --> 05:32.499

05:32.499 --> 05:35.377
I never received a payout
from Steve Horn or anyone else.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.547
That's really hard to believe
considering the fact

05:38.547 --> 05:41.925
that every conspirator
was paid in the cover-up.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.136
Well, I didn't conspire,
Ms. Buranek.

05:44.136 --> 05:47.014
I acted in accordance
with the authority vested in me

05:47.014 --> 05:49.016
by the Pentagon.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.268
You tested an unlicensed drug

05:51.268 --> 05:53.520
on a whole platoon
of Navy SEALs.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.980
I initiated that test.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.399
But I had no part in a cover-up,

05:57.399 --> 06:00.319
and I definitely didn't
do it for profit.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.071
Then why?

06:02.071 --> 06:05.074
Why test RD4895?

06:05.074 --> 06:07.618
My policies paved the way
for troop drawdown

06:07.618 --> 06:09.828
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.413
But for our special operators,

06:11.413 --> 06:13.874
it meant longer deployments,
more stress.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.417
More trauma.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.211
Which is an issue that I have

06:17.211 --> 06:19.713
a moral and professional
obligation to address.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.967
But EUAs are used
to solve acute problems,

06:23.967 --> 06:27.554
to prevent imminent,
catastrophic loss of life.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.682
On average,
between 17 and 22 veterans

06:30.682 --> 06:33.060
commit suicide every day.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.146
You add in active duty
who take their own lives,

06:36.146 --> 06:40.109
and it is the equivalent
of two 9/11s every year.

06:40.109 --> 06:42.069
And if that's not
catastrophic loss,

06:42.069 --> 06:44.238
I-I don't know what is.

06:45.280 --> 06:49.201

an entire platoon of Navy SEALs,

06:49.201 --> 06:50.994
you consider that catastrophic?

06:50.994 --> 06:54.039
Admiral Pillar sent me
regular medical reports.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.375
I had no reason
to question their content.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.963
So you're saying that you didn't
know about the tumors?

07:00.963 --> 07:02.923

07:09.972 --> 07:11.807
it was a clarifying moment.

07:11.807 --> 07:14.601

that Horn and his cabal

Seven,
Lincoln, four, two.

18:03.792 --> 18:06.044
I assume
my financials were helpful.

18:06.044 --> 18:09.005
As SecDef, I have to
make them public every year.

18:09.005 --> 18:12.217
$20 million would be
very hard to hide.

18:12.217 --> 18:14.177
Hard but not impossible.

18:14.177 --> 18:17.013
I would also like to access
the Odin's Sword mission log.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.307
I'll have it sent to your room.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.725
Anything else?

18:20.725 --> 18:22.811
We didn't finish our interview.

18:28.399 --> 18:31.903
To what extent are you aware
of my father's history?

18:31.903 --> 18:33.655
Well, I've read your biography.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.282
I know that he came
from logging money,

18:36.282 --> 18:38.660
that he served
in Korea and Vietnam.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.955
I know about his struggles.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.958
The alcoholism,
psychotic episodes.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.963
And that he took his own life.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.882
When I was a child,
he'd play me songs

18:52.882 --> 18:54.968
on his ukulele
in this very room.

18:56.261 --> 19:00.723
Couldn't carry a tune,
but he was happy.

19:02.016 --> 19:05.061
After the war,
that man was gone.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.897
Respectfully, Madam Secretary,
I think that's a dodge.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.984
It doesn't take
personal experience with PTSD

19:10.984 --> 19:13.361
to think curing it is good.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.154
Well, I expect it doesn't,

19:15.154 --> 19:18.199
but protecting your mother from
your father as a 12-year-old

19:18.199 --> 19:21.619
or finding your father
dead in the attic,

19:21.619 --> 19:23.496
it adds fuel to the fire.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.710
I'm sorry, but the question
that I'm interested in

19:28.710 --> 19:32.130
is whether or not we should
test an unproven drug

19:32.130 --> 19:34.757
on our troops without
their knowledge or consent.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.135
Trauma research
is more effective

19:37.135 --> 19:40.221
if carried out via blind study.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.307
It's not a choice I made.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.142
It's just the science.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.811
Why not make this whole thing
public after Odin's Sword?

19:46.811 --> 19:49.314
I am making it public.
Right now.

19:49.314 --> 19:52.025
One could argue that you're
trying to control the narrative.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.776

on dead men

19:53.776 --> 19:56.154

to contradict you.

19:56.154 --> 20:00.491

for authorizing RD4895?

20:00.491 --> 20:02.285
By some, maybe.

20:02.285 --> 20:05.622
But I suspect others
will understand my decision.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.667

James Reece will understand?

20:13.671 --> 20:15.590

the answer to that question.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.927
Do you blame him
for what he's done?

20:20.929 --> 20:23.640
I was in the war room
during Odin's Sword.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.643
I listened
as his men were murdered

20:26.643 --> 20:28.895

powerless to save them.

In the first story,
you made a decision--

29:05.703 --> 29:09.165
a questionable one maybe,
but a justifiable one--

29:09.165 --> 29:12.793

29:17.423 --> 29:19.925
who lied to you
about the experiment

29:19.925 --> 29:22.052

unspeakable crimes

and you took steps

29:30.895 --> 29:34.023
to curb their access
to your department.

29:34.023 --> 29:36.192
And you began
criminal investigations

29:36.192 --> 29:38.152

were held accountable.

actions that your records show

of those men's lives!

31:48.532 --> 31:51.910

31:55.497 --> 31:57.291
