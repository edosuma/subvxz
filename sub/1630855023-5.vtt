WEBVTT

00:03.264 --> 00:04.613
[glass clinks]

00:04.656 --> 00:06.484
Obviously, I don't have
to remind you gentlemen

00:06.528 --> 00:08.312
that this meeting
never took place.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.575
Of course not,
Mayor Blossom.

00:10.619 --> 00:13.230
Has Ethel Muggs
been talking much

00:13.274 --> 00:14.971
since she's been
with the Sisters?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.712
Not a peep.

00:16.755 --> 00:20.281
Sister Woodhouse
has imposed
a vow of silence.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.978
Very good.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.458
-What about the PTA?
-[Featherhead]
Parents are still upset.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.199
It's all they talk about
at our meetings.

00:25.242 --> 00:26.983
Who killed
Mr. and Mrs. Muggs?

00:27.027 --> 00:30.334
As long as people remain
focused on this murder case,

00:30.378 --> 00:31.814
the more precarious

00:31.857 --> 00:35.774
our grasp
of the situation becomes.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.211
What's the
Sheriff's office doing?

00:37.254 --> 00:41.258
Tom is trying
to find this "milkman"

00:41.302 --> 00:42.346
and the murder weapon.

00:42.390 --> 00:43.782
Why is he doing that?

00:46.437 --> 00:50.572
I have the murder weapon
right here.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.052
What are you
getting at, Fredreich?

00:52.095 --> 00:53.705
[Dr. Werthers]
We have to stop rehashing

00:53.749 --> 00:56.360
the Muggs murder case
and start making sure

00:56.404 --> 00:59.233
that something like it
never happens again.

00:59.276 --> 01:02.714
In my extensive research,
in case after case,

01:02.758 --> 01:07.632
comic books
are the influencing factor
in most incidents

01:07.676 --> 01:11.332
of juvenile delinquency
and teen violence.

01:11.375 --> 01:14.857
They are
a moral scourge, gentlemen.

01:14.900 --> 01:18.078
And their creators,
criminal degenerates.

01:18.121 --> 01:21.081
That's what the PTA
should be talking about.

01:21.124 --> 01:21.951
Comic books.

01:22.952 --> 01:25.389
Not the Muggs.

01:25.433 --> 01:30.351
And I believe
I know exactly how
to make that happen.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.006
[typewriter clacks]

01:35.660 --> 01:39.316
Well, look who strolls in
whenever his heart desires.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.317
What do you want, kid?

01:40.360 --> 01:41.405
I was just
in the neighborhood.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.451
Where is everyone?

01:43.494 --> 01:44.843
They're all out
with a stomach bug.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.410
Now I'm under more water
than the Titanic.

01:46.454 --> 01:47.628
-Can I help?
-[typing]

01:47.672 --> 01:49.370
I need a full issue...

01:49.413 --> 01:50.501
I can do that.

01:50.545 --> 01:51.894
...written by tomorrow morning.

01:51.937 --> 01:53.287
Yeah, that's no problem,
Mr. Fieldstone.

01:53.330 --> 01:54.853
I'm fast.
I'm a great speller.

01:54.896 --> 01:57.029
Four stories.
Seven pages each.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.378
Zero margin for error.

01:58.422 --> 01:59.509
[Jughead]
I'll write 'em on spec.

01:59.554 --> 02:01.469
If you like them, then great.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.775
And if not,
there's plenty more
where that came from.

02:03.819 --> 02:05.647
Right.

02:05.690 --> 02:08.389
If you have trouble
coming up with some ideas,

02:08.431 --> 02:10.259
take these springboards.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.696
Talk them through with Bernie.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.568
I will. Won't let you down.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.309
Bernie.

02:18.442 --> 02:21.793
Gosh, Bernie,
all these stories
have been done to death.

02:21.837 --> 02:24.361
Aren't there
any original ideas anymore?

02:24.405 --> 02:25.579
Says the teenager?

02:26.972 --> 02:29.932
Bernie, you're a genius.

02:29.975 --> 02:33.631
What about stories
about teenagers
and high school?

02:33.675 --> 02:35.851
Pep Comics doesn't have
any of those, right?

02:35.894 --> 02:36.982
Uh... [sighs]

02:37.026 --> 02:38.245
Al says he doesn't
relate to them.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.638
But teenagers
do buy our books.

02:40.682 --> 02:42.945
Well, shucks,
me and my friends do.

02:42.988 --> 02:45.034
[snaps finger]
What about a narrator

02:45.077 --> 02:50.170
that's actually
a witchy lunch lady,
or a creepy janitor?

02:50.213 --> 02:53.216
We can call it
"Homeroom of Horrors."

02:53.260 --> 02:54.478
Huh?

02:54.522 --> 02:55.958
You think Mr. Fieldstone
will bite?

02:56.001 --> 02:56.915
Sure.

02:57.481 --> 02:58.656
Give it a whirl.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.403
[door opens]

03:06.447 --> 03:08.362
There's my little
tortured genius.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.102
-[door closes]
-Think you could
take a break

03:10.146 --> 03:12.103
from writing the next
great American novel

03:12.148 --> 03:15.020
and take this glamour gal
to go see a fun flick?

03:15.064 --> 03:16.370
[typing rapidly]

03:16.413 --> 03:17.806
Diaboliqueis playing
at the Babylonium,

03:17.849 --> 03:20.461
and I know
you don't mind subtitles.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.419
Ooh. Could we go
tomorrow, maybe?

03:22.463 --> 03:23.855
I'm on deadline.

03:23.899 --> 03:26.466
Al's asked me to write
an entire issue by morning.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.817
An entire issue?

03:28.860 --> 03:31.211
Sounds like
a bit of a coup for you.

03:31.254 --> 03:32.516
Yeah, it is.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.039
But it's also
a lot of pressure.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.172
Though, if I do a bang up job
on these pages tonight,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.174
Fieldstone could ask me
to be one of his go-to's.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.611
Okay. Okay.

03:40.655 --> 03:43.048
My French thriller about
murderous schoolteachers
can wait.

03:43.091 --> 03:46.269
But since I'm here,
maybe I can help you.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.401
How far have you gotten?

03:47.444 --> 03:49.359
I'm almost done
with my first story.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.492
I'm all ears.
What's it about?

03:51.535 --> 03:52.667
Sports-themed.

03:52.710 --> 03:54.364
Because what's scarier
than gym class?

03:54.408 --> 03:55.670
And it has a narrator,

03:55.713 --> 03:57.367
like all of my yell yarns will,

03:57.411 --> 04:00.501
um, called the Key-Keeper.

04:00.544 --> 04:03.330
-I had one of the artists
at Pep Comics do a mockup.
-[chuckles]

04:03.373 --> 04:04.548
It's pretty nifty, right?

04:04.592 --> 04:06.811
The niftiest.
Looks like a real charmer.

04:09.597 --> 04:14.689
[Key-Keeper] Well, well, well,
if it isn't another
problem child.

04:14.732 --> 04:17.430
You're looking for a little
mischief and mayhem,

04:17.474 --> 04:18.649
aren't you?

04:18.692 --> 04:21.478
Well, maybe I can be
of some assistance.

04:21.522 --> 04:22.610
[keys jangling]

04:23.567 --> 04:26.396
I'm the Key-Keeper,
you see?

04:26.440 --> 04:30.792
The midnight custodian
of this schoolhouse of horrors.

04:30.835 --> 04:33.621
Come along
and let's wake the dead

04:33.664 --> 04:35.536
with a real spine twister,
shall we?

04:35.579 --> 04:36.754
[keys jangling]

04:38.234 --> 04:39.496
[door unlocks]

04:39.540 --> 04:41.193
I call
this sordid little tale...

04:42.064 --> 04:44.545
[Key-Keeper reading]

04:44.588 --> 04:45.676
[whistle blows]

04:45.720 --> 04:47.156
[Key-Keeper]
Every team has one,

04:47.199 --> 04:49.158
the runt, the klutz,
the pip-squeak.

04:49.201 --> 04:50.638
On the Bulldogs
basketball team,

04:50.681 --> 04:52.944
that half pint was

04:52.988 --> 04:55.295
Dilton Doiley,

04:55.338 --> 04:59.037
who was short,
near-sighted
and uncoordinated.

05:01.605 --> 05:04.608
At the end
of one particularly
grueling practice,

05:04.652 --> 05:08.395
Coach Kleats
had the team line up
for free throws.

05:08.438 --> 05:12.442
No one could leave
until everyone
had made a basket.

05:12.486 --> 05:16.490
But Dilton couldn't
make a shot
to save his life.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.579
Come on, Doiley.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.320
Get your head in the game.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.323
[ball bounces]

05:26.717 --> 05:28.806
Maybe you need
a little motivation.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.593
[whistle blows]

05:32.636 --> 05:34.508
[Key-Keeper] Coach Kleats
had the other players

05:34.551 --> 05:39.513
start running laps
until Dilton sunk one
lousy bucket.

05:39.556 --> 05:40.992
You're a dead man, Doiley.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.865
[Key-Keeper] Poor Dilton.

05:43.908 --> 05:49.087
He would soon learn
the true meaning
of the term "foul play."

05:50.698 --> 05:52.961
The hell is wrong
with you, Doiley?

05:54.397 --> 05:55.790
I'm sorry, fellas.

05:55.832 --> 05:58.488
I... I'm trying my best.

05:58.532 --> 05:59.968
Why are you even here

06:00.011 --> 06:02.797
if you can't make
one stinking basket?

06:02.840 --> 06:04.842
I just wanted to be
part of a team.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.496
Then be the damn water boy.

06:07.541 --> 06:08.672
[scoffs]

06:08.716 --> 06:11.414
It's like what
Coach Kleats said...

06:11.458 --> 06:13.155
"You've got to get
your head in the game."

06:14.286 --> 06:16.593
How... how do I do that?

06:16.637 --> 06:18.334
Maybe a night
stuffed in a locker

06:18.378 --> 06:19.466
will help you figure it out.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.468
What? No. Guys, guys, guys.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.557
Please, please,
don't do that.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.732
No. Please! Please!

06:24.775 --> 06:25.733
You don't understand.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.822
Stop! I can't.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.954
-Hey, guys, maybe this isn't
such a good idea.
-[Dilton] Don't leave me here!

06:29.998 --> 06:32.696
-Stuff it, Andrews.
-[Dilton crying]
I can't be here alone.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.524
-Please. I can't.
-Doiley's got to learn.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.526
He's gonna start
pulling his weight.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.183
Or we're gonna murder him.

06:44.273 --> 06:45.317
No! Don't go!

06:45.361 --> 06:46.928
Please! Please! Don't go!

06:46.971 --> 06:49.539
Don't leave me here!
I can't do this. No!

06:49.582 --> 06:51.193
No! Please!

06:51.236 --> 06:54.631
[Key-Keeper] What these
merciless jocks didn't know

06:54.675 --> 07:01.638
was that
Dilton Doiley was born
morbidly claustrophobic.

07:03.771 --> 07:04.989
[birds chirping]

07:06.295 --> 07:08.297
[breathing uneasily]

07:08.340 --> 07:10.821
[door opens]

07:10.865 --> 07:14.695
[Key-Keeper] So, by the time
the day shift found
and released Dilton

07:14.738 --> 07:17.741
the next morning...

07:17.785 --> 07:22.442
Dilton had suffered
a complete psychotic break.

07:24.574 --> 07:27.490
He was a changed man.

07:27.534 --> 07:30.319
A madman, you might say.

07:30.362 --> 07:34.454
Hell-bent on revenge
against the Bulldogs.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.153
[glass breaks]

07:38.196 --> 07:40.460
[Key-Keeper] Then it was just
a matter of lying in wait

07:40.503 --> 07:43.811
for his teammates
to reconvene
for basketball practice

07:43.854 --> 07:46.030
later that afternoon.

07:47.554 --> 07:50.687
Luckily, Dilton had
the perfect hidey-hole

07:50.731 --> 07:53.951
from which to pop out
and surprise his teammates.

07:55.387 --> 07:57.825
After which Dilton
could dedicate himself

07:57.868 --> 08:01.655
to perfecting
his free throw technique.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.221
Gotta keep
my head in the game.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.007
Gotta keep my head
in the game.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.443
[Kleats] Attaboy, Doiley!

08:28.638 --> 08:31.075
Help! [yelling]

08:31.119 --> 08:33.774
Gotta keep
my head in the game.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.645
Gotta keep
my head in the game.

08:36.777 --> 08:39.082
Gotta keep
my head in the game.

08:39.126 --> 08:41.129
Gotta keep
my head in the game.

08:41.172 --> 08:42.652
Gotta keep
my head in the game.

08:42.696 --> 08:43.914
[screeching]

08:45.873 --> 08:46.656
[woman screaming]

08:49.441 --> 08:50.790
Good for Dilton.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.749
Those awful bullies
got what was coming to them.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.011
Exactly.

08:54.055 --> 08:55.622
And you see, that's what
nitwits like Werthers

08:55.665 --> 08:57.101
just don't understand.

08:57.145 --> 08:58.668
What, exactly?

08:58.712 --> 09:00.148
Well, that these
so-called "degenerate" comics

09:00.191 --> 09:02.759
are actually bite-sized
morality tales.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.065
Especially those that involve

09:04.108 --> 09:06.241
Julian Blossom getting
his head chopped off.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.243
I mean, you joke,
but it's true.

09:08.286 --> 09:11.072
Yes, comics can be
over the top
and bloody sometimes,

09:11.115 --> 09:13.988
but in these stories,
people that break the rules
get punished.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.033
People who are cruel
to others get punished.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.253
People who have lustful sex
get punished.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.647
Lustful sex, did you say?

09:20.690 --> 09:22.736
Tell me more
about that, Juggiekins.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.651
[chuckles] I've got a tale
for you.

09:24.694 --> 09:26.435
And it starts,
believe it or not,

09:26.478 --> 09:28.655
-on a dark and stormy night...
-[thunder rumbling]

09:28.698 --> 09:33.137
With a flat tire
near an isolated mansion.

09:33.181 --> 09:37.011
And a young, strapping man
in need of assistance.

09:37.054 --> 09:38.708
[thunder rumbling]

09:40.841 --> 09:42.364
Yes?

09:42.407 --> 09:43.713
May I help you?

09:43.757 --> 09:45.236
I'm sorry to bother you
at this hour, ma'am,

09:45.280 --> 09:48.718
but my hot rod got
a flat tire down the road.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.459
Must've ran over a nail
or something.

09:50.502 --> 09:51.852
[Nana Rose] Oh, how dreadful.

09:51.895 --> 09:55.333
And now here you are, stranded,
you poor dear.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.118
Why don't you come inside?

09:57.161 --> 10:00.730
You can use our telephone
to call the garage.

10:00.774 --> 10:04.821
At this hour?
Oh, they'll be closed, ma'am.

10:04.865 --> 10:07.911
Would it be too much trouble
if I stayed the night?

10:07.955 --> 10:10.218
That way, in the morning,
I can call the garage

10:10.261 --> 10:11.567
and I'll be out of your hair.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.699
[thunder rumbling]

10:12.742 --> 10:14.744
I suppose. But...

10:14.788 --> 10:17.617
I'm afraid the storm
has knocked out our power.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.619
But you can warm yourself
by the fire.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.359
Well, come in.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.534
Come in.

10:22.578 --> 10:23.971
Oh, you look a fright.

10:24.014 --> 10:24.928
[thunder rumbling]

10:27.104 --> 10:31.326
[Key-Keeper]
They say a picture
is worth 1,000 words,

10:31.369 --> 10:34.329
but I only need two
for this one.

10:34.372 --> 10:36.157
Hubba-hubba.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.681
[slurping]

10:38.725 --> 10:40.596
[gulps and clears throat]

10:41.553 --> 10:42.816
Thank you for the tea, ma'am.

10:42.859 --> 10:47.037
It's... I already feel better.

10:47.081 --> 10:50.606
There's not much
in this world that
a strong cup of tea

10:50.650 --> 10:52.956
and a roaring fire can't fix.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.830
And you're welcome to stay
in my guest room tonight.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.440
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.137
That's very kind of you.

11:00.181 --> 11:04.838
However, there are one or two
ground rules you must observe.

11:05.534 --> 11:06.666
Of course.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.015
Of course. Anything.

11:08.058 --> 11:11.888
Once you're in your room,
you must stay there.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.934
All night.

11:13.977 --> 11:17.372
And you must lock the door,
and keep it locked

11:17.415 --> 11:19.853
for the entire night.

11:19.896 --> 11:23.247
Any particular reason why?

11:23.291 --> 11:24.858
[Nana Rose] Alas, yes.

11:24.901 --> 11:27.643
I am not alone
in this house.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.819
My granddaughter
lives with me,

11:29.863 --> 11:34.040
and she's not quite
in her right mind.

11:34.084 --> 11:37.261
She has this
compulsive craving

11:37.305 --> 11:39.307
for intimate, physical,

11:39.350 --> 11:44.921
some might even say
inappropriate touching.

11:45.748 --> 11:46.880
Really?

11:46.923 --> 11:50.013
Oh, yes.
She's ravenous for it.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.929
Can't keep her hands
to herself.

11:56.454 --> 11:58.718
Wow. That's...

11:59.806 --> 12:02.025
I mean, that sounds... Wow.

12:02.069 --> 12:05.812
She's even been known
to sneak into the bedrooms

12:05.855 --> 12:09.250
of strange young men
in the middle of the night

12:09.293 --> 12:13.254
in order to get her "fix,"
as it were.

12:13.297 --> 12:14.864
[thunder rumbling]

12:18.781 --> 12:23.960
Is... that your granddaughter?

12:25.048 --> 12:26.920
Yes, it is.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.660
She's beautiful, isn't she?

12:30.271 --> 12:32.055
Well, it's getting late.

12:32.099 --> 12:34.710
Let's get you settled,
shall we?

12:40.847 --> 12:43.588
[Key-Keeper] Surely some rules
were meant to be broken,

12:43.632 --> 12:45.982
especially when
the consequences might prove

12:46.026 --> 12:49.943
to be downright titillating.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.862
[door creaking]

13:08.570 --> 13:10.093
[curtains ruffling]

13:10.137 --> 13:11.312
[Cheryl] You're here.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.837
You came.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.144
Are you the old lady's
granddaughter?

13:17.187 --> 13:18.972
Yes. I'm Cheryl.

13:20.103 --> 13:21.844
I'm so glad you're here.

13:21.888 --> 13:27.110
It's been so long
since I've gotten to touch...
like this.

13:27.154 --> 13:30.853
I... sure am happy
to be here, too.

13:30.897 --> 13:31.767
Let me just light a candle.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.334
-No! No!
-Whoa.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.683
No.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.467
What we're about to do
is best...

13:36.511 --> 13:38.252
It's best done in darkness.

13:38.295 --> 13:40.080
Now kiss me.

13:40.123 --> 13:43.997
And let me... feel you.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.522
[kissing]

13:47.565 --> 13:52.396
[Key-Keeper]
Avert your eyes, pervert,
and turn the page,

13:52.440 --> 13:56.009
to a bright new day.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.279
[Nana Rose]
How was your night,
young man?

14:05.322 --> 14:07.672
Did you sleep well?

14:07.716 --> 14:12.547
It was... incredible.
[laughs]

14:12.590 --> 14:14.854
Thank you again
for the hospitality, ma'am.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.944
I, uh...
I saw your granddaughter,

14:17.987 --> 14:20.250
I think, by the window.

14:21.817 --> 14:22.992
So what's wrong with her?

14:23.036 --> 14:24.515
Some kind of mental illness?

14:24.559 --> 14:27.040
Oh, Cheryl was once
youthful and vibrant,

14:27.083 --> 14:29.564
like any young girl her age.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.827
But she wanted adventure.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.047
And I couldn't help
but indulge her.

14:34.090 --> 14:38.442
She took a trip
to some tropical jungle

14:38.486 --> 14:39.879
in some far-off place,

14:39.922 --> 14:43.143
and unfortunately,
while she was there,

14:43.186 --> 14:46.886
she contracted
a rare form of leprosy.

14:50.367 --> 14:51.847
Leprosy?

14:51.891 --> 14:55.677
Horrible, terrible,
disfiguring disease.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.201
Rotting her swollen flesh away,

14:58.245 --> 15:00.508
and incredibly painful.

15:00.551 --> 15:01.944
[gulps]

15:01.988 --> 15:03.685
Now she can't be
around other people

15:03.728 --> 15:06.427
because it's
so very contagious,
you know.

15:08.864 --> 15:11.780
But, I mean, you don't...

15:11.823 --> 15:15.479
Oh, no,
I was exposed as a child,

15:15.523 --> 15:17.046
and so I'm immune.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.961
I don't suppose you...

15:19.005 --> 15:21.181
Am immune? No.

15:21.224 --> 15:24.924
Mercifully,
she'll soon succumb
to the leprosy and die,

15:24.967 --> 15:26.447
which is why

15:26.490 --> 15:28.144
I do everything in my power

15:28.188 --> 15:34.194
to ensure that she relishes
her final days on Earth.

15:34.237 --> 15:36.109
[sputtering]
What do you mean?

15:36.152 --> 15:37.719
What do you mean by that?

15:37.762 --> 15:41.201
It was no accident
that brought you here,
young man.

15:41.244 --> 15:45.118
How do you think those nails
got onto that road?

15:46.467 --> 15:49.426
I did warn you.

15:49.470 --> 15:54.170
I gave you a chance
to lock that door
and be a good boy.

15:54.214 --> 15:57.652
And now you're almost
certainly infected as well.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.132
[Cheryl] After last night,

15:59.175 --> 16:02.918
we're going to be together
forever, and ever

16:02.962 --> 16:04.050
till death do us part.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.314
[screaming]

16:13.407 --> 16:15.017
Well, that was grotesque.

16:16.105 --> 16:17.672
What was the moral there?

16:17.715 --> 16:19.369
Don't trust creepy old ladies

16:19.413 --> 16:23.373
and their nymphomaniac,
leprosy-ridden
granddaughters?

16:23.417 --> 16:27.856
Well, it's more of
a "curiosity killed the cat"
message, I think.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.466
Ah.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.512
Or don't engage
in heavy petting
in the dark with someone,

16:31.555 --> 16:33.340
if you haven't got
proper protection. [chuckles]

16:34.950 --> 16:39.128
You know, I'm hearing
that Archie and Cheryl
broke up,

16:39.172 --> 16:42.392
and that in the end,
they didn't do much more
than neck...

16:42.436 --> 16:44.438
Oh, yeah? Well...

16:44.481 --> 16:48.050
Who can keep up
with all the horny teens
at Riverdale High?

16:48.094 --> 16:51.010
I mean, what else
is there to do?

16:52.185 --> 16:55.318
That's why God created
high school.

16:55.362 --> 16:58.191
So there'd be a place
where boys could...

16:58.234 --> 17:00.976
chase girls and vice versa.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.500
Yeah.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.241
I mean...

17:05.285 --> 17:06.763
girls will do
just about anything

17:06.808 --> 17:08.417
to get a boy's attention.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.464
Including feigning an interest
in comic books, apparently.

17:16.686 --> 17:18.079
[typing]

17:18.124 --> 17:19.386
[Key-Keeper]
Every school has one.

17:19.429 --> 17:21.474
The plain Jane
with the ponytail mane,

17:21.518 --> 17:23.912
the sweater-set
waiting for better yet

17:23.954 --> 17:27.481
who none of the boys
seemed to sick
their sights on.

17:27.523 --> 17:31.746
Bland Betty was
little more than
an invisible girl.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.401
Yes, my foul fiends,

17:34.444 --> 17:39.667
Betty's prospects of landing
a date were very grave indeed.

17:39.710 --> 17:43.714
So she followed the advice
of her favorite beauty mags.

17:43.758 --> 17:47.066
And now,
how can I help you, hun?

17:47.109 --> 17:50.069
I would like
a new look, please.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.419
Oh, what's giving you
the gringles,

17:52.462 --> 17:53.898
doll face?

17:53.942 --> 17:56.162
I just feel so...

17:57.163 --> 17:58.903
unseen.

17:58.947 --> 18:01.210
All the girls
at my school have beaus,

18:01.254 --> 18:04.300
and it's just like
I'm a, uh...

18:04.822 --> 18:06.302
ghost.

18:06.346 --> 18:07.651
I need something...

18:08.696 --> 18:10.263
else, something new.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.265
Something amazing
that will get
all the boys' attention.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.093
[hairdresser]
Well, I've got to tell you,

18:14.136 --> 18:16.356
this ponytail
is doing you no favors.

18:16.399 --> 18:17.705
But, but, but,

18:17.748 --> 18:20.664
I just came back
from my fabulous
honeymoon abroad.

18:20.708 --> 18:24.146
And there's this new hairstyle
that is all the rage in Europe.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.234
Really? What is it?

18:25.278 --> 18:28.542
[hairdresser]
It's called the Beehive.

18:28.585 --> 18:29.673
"Beehive."

18:30.848 --> 18:32.502
Sounds sophisticated.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.069
Oh, it is.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.027
So we tease up all your hair,
put in some extensions,

18:36.071 --> 18:39.248
and then we roll it all up
into a dome,
just like a hive.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.338
A hive-hive?

18:42.382 --> 18:43.600
I know it sounds
a little silly,

18:43.644 --> 18:44.993
but wait till you see it.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.429
All the girls
in England and France,

18:46.473 --> 18:47.604
they just love it.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.258
And the boys,
they're crazy about it.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.347
And, on my mother's grave,

18:51.391 --> 18:53.393
may she rest in peace...

18:53.436 --> 18:56.570
you're going to get
all the attention
you've ever wanted,

18:56.613 --> 18:57.614
and then some.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.443
What the heck?

19:00.487 --> 19:02.924
If it's good enough
for the Parisians,
it's good enough for me.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.143
[hairdresser] Oh, smart girl.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.970
You're going to look so chic.

19:06.014 --> 19:08.408
Now, there's just one thing.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.453
Once we get
your goldie locks
up into the hive,

19:10.497 --> 19:12.151
you're not gonna be able
to wash your hair

19:12.194 --> 19:13.587
or undo it, ever.

19:15.066 --> 19:17.721
Oh. Well, how do I
maintain it?

19:17.765 --> 19:19.462
With this. Hair spray.

19:19.506 --> 19:22.726
Use throughout the day
as needed.

19:22.770 --> 19:25.425
Well, my mom says,
I'm supposed
to wash my hair

19:25.468 --> 19:27.514
every other day
or at least once a week.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.864
With all due respect
to your dear mama,

19:29.907 --> 19:31.213
I'm the professional.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.954
And you do want
to look beautiful.

19:32.997 --> 19:34.173
Am I right?

19:36.784 --> 19:38.264
[Key-Keeper] The next day,

19:38.307 --> 19:40.657
an all-new Betty
showed up at school.

19:40.701 --> 19:44.705
Her coif climbed
to such heights
it rivaled the Tower of Babel.

19:44.748 --> 19:48.709
And similarly,
it got everybody talking.

19:48.752 --> 19:52.147
All the boys went
goo-goo-ga-ga.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.323
And as for the girls, well,

19:54.367 --> 19:58.284
they were positively gangrene
with envy.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.079
[coughing]

20:13.995 --> 20:15.910
Watch where you're
spraying, Betty.

20:15.953 --> 20:18.521
You know, that ridiculous
hairstyle will never
change the fact

20:18.565 --> 20:21.350
that you'll always be
a ponytail princess

20:21.394 --> 20:22.743
on the inside.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.571
[both laugh]

20:24.614 --> 20:26.312
[Key-Keeper] Betty didn't care

20:26.355 --> 20:27.748
what Cheryl
and Veronica thought.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.358
In fact,
that was the first time

20:29.402 --> 20:31.055
they'd spoken to her.

20:31.099 --> 20:33.928
And once Betty got
that blush of attention,

20:33.971 --> 20:38.324
well, she started needing it,
feeding off it.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.543
The more hairspray
she put in her hair,

20:40.587 --> 20:43.329
the heavier and more
shellacked it became.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.548
And the more the boys
noticed her.

20:45.592 --> 20:48.159
Can I carry your books
to class, Betty?

20:48.203 --> 20:49.683
Aw, gee, thanks, Julian.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.424
Hey, uh, Betty,
can I take you out

20:51.467 --> 20:52.816
this Friday night, please?

20:52.860 --> 20:54.470
[chuckles] Aw, Archie...

20:54.514 --> 20:57.212
I'll think about it.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.823
[Key-Keeper] And Betty
stayed true to her word.

20:59.867 --> 21:04.263
She didn't wash her hair
or undo it, ever.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.395
She even slept in her beehive,

21:06.439 --> 21:10.399
putting more hairspray on
before tucking herself in
at night.

21:10.443 --> 21:15.274
And that's when
the very bad thing happened.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.710
[suspenseful music playing]

21:20.583 --> 21:24.413
I swear, in all my years,
I've never seen a cuter couple.

21:24.457 --> 21:27.024
-[chuckles]
-She's a cool cookie now,
isn't she, Pop?

21:27.068 --> 21:28.374
What do you mean, "now?"

21:28.417 --> 21:30.419
Betty's always been a peach.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.728
You're making me blush, Archie.

21:34.771 --> 21:36.382
Hey, I'm a lucky cat.

21:36.425 --> 21:37.905
I'm going out
with the ginchiest girl

21:37.948 --> 21:40.429
with the ginchiest hair
at Riverdale High.

21:40.473 --> 21:41.691
["I Got Stung" playing]

21:41.735 --> 21:44.433
Mmm! Best song ever.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.479
-Come on, snake, let's rattle.
-Okay.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.750
[suspenseful music playing]

21:58.186 --> 21:59.492
Betty, is everything all right?

22:00.623 --> 22:01.624
Whoa, Betty.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.497
[Betty] Something's not...

22:04.540 --> 22:06.455
Betty. Betty!

22:06.499 --> 22:09.066
-Betty!
-[coughing]

22:09.110 --> 22:10.459
Someone get some help!

22:10.503 --> 22:13.462
Betty's having
some kind of fit!

22:13.506 --> 22:15.508
Someone call the hospital!

22:15.551 --> 22:17.336
Oh, God! Betty!

22:17.379 --> 22:20.556
[Key-Keeper] No one could guess
how a young girl like Betty,

22:20.600 --> 22:24.647
so full of life,
would just drop dead.

22:24.691 --> 22:29.826
Then again, maybe the town's
coroner will have the answers.

22:29.870 --> 22:33.526
So young, so beautiful,

22:33.569 --> 22:36.442
and what
a fascinating hairstyle.

22:37.573 --> 22:38.531
Hmm.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.450
[whirring]

22:52.849 --> 22:53.894
Oh, my.

22:56.549 --> 22:58.159
What have we here?

22:58.202 --> 22:59.465
No.

22:59.508 --> 23:00.553
No!

23:01.771 --> 23:03.033
Please, no!

23:03.077 --> 23:05.775
No, anything but spiders!

23:05.819 --> 23:07.560
[Key-Keeper] Turns out,
Betty's hair

23:07.603 --> 23:10.389
attracted more than just boys.

23:10.432 --> 23:13.130
A black widow spider
had crawled

23:13.174 --> 23:14.828
into her tresses that night

23:14.871 --> 23:17.787
and laid a batch of eggs
in that ginchy hive of hers.

23:17.831 --> 23:21.182
And when those
itsy-bitsy spiders hatched,

23:21.225 --> 23:22.836
they chewed into her brain,

23:22.879 --> 23:26.492
which is what triggered
Betty's deadly diner bug-out.

23:26.535 --> 23:28.015
Poor, sweet Betty.

23:28.058 --> 23:30.887
She had to learn her lessons
the hard way.

23:30.931 --> 23:35.718
Beauty is only skin deep,
and vanity kills.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.416
-[screeching]
-[woman screaming]

23:41.289 --> 23:45.772
"Beauty is only skin deep?"
"Vanity kills?"

23:46.860 --> 23:49.428
Are these actually
different lessons

23:49.471 --> 23:51.952
or variations on a theme?

23:51.995 --> 23:54.868
And what's wrong
with wanting to look good?

23:54.911 --> 23:56.783
Boys do the same thing.

23:56.826 --> 23:59.699
They toss weights around,
to turn themselves
into he-men.

23:59.742 --> 24:03.137
-Uh...
-At any rate, by my count,

24:03.180 --> 24:04.747
you're down to your last story

24:04.791 --> 24:07.141
and I still haven't had
a starring role in one.

24:08.664 --> 24:10.666
Well, say, that's a notion.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.713
Something romantic
would be nice.

24:13.756 --> 24:17.456
Or something that focuses
on female friendship.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.022
Yeah, what if we did a flip

24:19.066 --> 24:21.764
of the classic teenage
love triangle?

24:21.808 --> 24:23.157
One in which the girls

24:23.200 --> 24:25.812
don't go at each other's
throats and cat-fight.

24:25.855 --> 24:27.901
Now, you're singing my tune.

24:30.120 --> 24:34.473
Presenting my fourth and final
story of the evening.

24:34.516 --> 24:37.911
A terror tale I'm calling
"My Better Half."

24:40.435 --> 24:42.045
Archie's a good egg.

24:42.089 --> 24:46.659
But a half-wit when it comes
to decision-making.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.748
He struggles
with the most basic

24:48.791 --> 24:50.750
of all
multiple-choice questions.

24:50.793 --> 24:54.754
Should he go
for A, "The girl next door?"

24:54.797 --> 24:58.671
Or B,
"The rich starlet-socialite?"

24:58.714 --> 25:02.065
But in a rare stroke
of mad genius,

25:02.109 --> 25:05.678
Archie chose C,
"Both of the above."

25:05.721 --> 25:08.028
So, on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays,

25:08.071 --> 25:09.682
Archie takes Betty out.

25:09.725 --> 25:11.901
And on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Saturdays,

25:11.945 --> 25:14.034
he takes out Veronica.

25:14.077 --> 25:16.819
The one downside
to this break-neck schedule

25:16.863 --> 25:18.865
was that Archie would,
on occasion,

25:18.908 --> 25:22.085
collapse from sheer exhaustion.

25:22.129 --> 25:24.610
But it was nothing
that couldn't be rectified

25:24.653 --> 25:26.350
with a strong cup of coffee.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.352
Or four.

25:28.396 --> 25:30.485
But even for
a strapping young buck,

25:30.529 --> 25:33.706
six dates a week
will wear a fella out.

25:33.749 --> 25:36.186
That's why Archie
saved Sundays for himself.

25:36.230 --> 25:40.103
To rest, recover, and replenish
for the week ahead.

25:43.672 --> 25:45.413
Now, you might think Archie

25:45.456 --> 25:47.502
would try to keep
his relationships a secret.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.112
But he didn't.

25:49.156 --> 25:51.680
Betty and Veronica
knew he was dating the other.

25:51.724 --> 25:57.381
Still, each girl wanted Archie
all to herself.

25:57.425 --> 25:58.644
They're playing
Double Indemnity

25:58.687 --> 26:00.646
at the Babylonium
tomorrow night,

26:00.689 --> 26:03.039
if you want to play
a little back row bingo.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.825
Oh, I wish I could swing it,
but I got plans.

26:05.868 --> 26:08.610
Meaning you've got a date
with Veronica.

26:08.654 --> 26:11.613
When are you going to drop
that vapid airhead?

26:11.657 --> 26:13.615
Oh, please. Don't get razzled.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.312
Why shouldn't I?

26:15.356 --> 26:19.534
Having to share my beau
with that smelly tomboy.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.840
Don't I make you happy?

26:20.883 --> 26:22.406
Of course you do.

26:22.450 --> 26:25.235
Then why aren't I enough?

26:25.279 --> 26:28.282
Oh, come on,
it's not like that.

26:28.325 --> 26:30.937
Hey, you guys
are both so different.

26:30.980 --> 26:33.243
But let me let you in
on a little secret.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.597
[whispers] You're my favorite.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.512
[both] Really?

26:41.556 --> 26:42.949
Oh, Archie.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.998
How do you do it, Andrews?

26:49.042 --> 26:51.479
Two broads at the same time.
What's your secret?

26:51.522 --> 26:55.309
All right, listen,
'cause I'm only gonna
say this once, okay?

26:55.352 --> 26:57.485
You tell them
what they want to hear.

26:57.528 --> 27:00.096
That yes,
I'm seeing other girls,

27:00.140 --> 27:03.839
but I'm only serious
about you.

27:03.883 --> 27:07.669
Okay? You feed them
the same three simple words.

27:11.499 --> 27:13.327
"You're my favorite."

27:13.370 --> 27:14.371
[boys snicker]

27:15.285 --> 27:17.940
Technically, that's four words.

27:17.984 --> 27:19.855
"You're" is a contraction.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.117
"You are my favorite."

27:21.161 --> 27:24.381
-Four words.
-Shut up, Doiley.

27:24.425 --> 27:27.167
We're learning
from Don Juan here.

27:27.210 --> 27:32.302
But don't you ever get...
exhausted?

27:32.825 --> 27:34.391
Sure.

27:34.435 --> 27:37.307
But that's why God
invented Sundays and coffee.

27:37.351 --> 27:39.527
[boys laughing]

27:39.570 --> 27:41.834
Things might've kept
humming along as is

27:41.877 --> 27:43.313
until graduation day,

27:43.357 --> 27:46.665
but the Good Ship Archie
was headed for an iceberg,

27:46.708 --> 27:48.318
Valentine's Day,

27:48.362 --> 27:51.974
which, this year, disastrously,
landed on a Sunday.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.410
So, Veronica,
who's the lucky guy

27:53.454 --> 27:55.630
taking you out
for Valentine's Day?

27:55.674 --> 27:58.589
-Archiekins, of course.
-Keep dreaming.

27:58.633 --> 27:59.895
Archie is my date.

27:59.939 --> 28:01.767
You know, Betty,
for a smart girl,

28:01.810 --> 28:03.464
you really are dense.

28:03.507 --> 28:06.902
Archie is going to spend V-Day
with his best girl.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.295
And that's me.

28:08.338 --> 28:10.036
-Says you.
-Says him.

28:10.079 --> 28:13.822
Archiekins says the only reason
he spends so much time with you

28:13.866 --> 28:15.911
is because
you're a charity case.

28:15.955 --> 28:20.089
First of all, he hates
being called Archiekins.

28:20.133 --> 28:21.961
Second of all, the only reason

28:22.004 --> 28:23.919
he spends any time
with you at all

28:23.963 --> 28:26.748
is because your ego
is so fragile

28:26.792 --> 28:29.882
he's afraid you might do
something desperate or crazy

28:29.925 --> 28:31.100
if he breaks up with you.

28:31.144 --> 28:32.841
He said I'm fragile?

28:32.885 --> 28:35.539
Oh, as a Glamerge egg.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.716
Well, he told me
you're so high-strung

28:37.759 --> 28:41.415
you sometimes take your mom's
sleeping pills to go to bed.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.765
-He told you that?
-Mmm-hmm.

28:43.809 --> 28:46.768
Sounds like someone's been
playing you two for fools.

28:49.728 --> 28:50.990
[scoffs]

28:51.033 --> 28:52.905
[both] That rat-fink!

28:52.948 --> 28:54.907
Archie, you have
to choose right now.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.865
Who's going to be your date
for Valentine's Day?

28:56.909 --> 28:58.693
And after you pick me,
of course,

28:58.737 --> 29:00.695
you need to end things
with Betty permanently.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.046
Ladies, ladies,
let's all calm down.

29:04.090 --> 29:06.396
In fact...

29:06.440 --> 29:08.659
neither of you can be my date
on Valentine's Day.

29:08.703 --> 29:10.096
[both] Why not?

29:11.880 --> 29:13.534
'Cause I'm taking my mom.

29:14.491 --> 29:15.971
You see, it's...

29:16.015 --> 29:18.365
It's her first Valentine's Day
without my dad, and...

29:20.149 --> 29:21.977
And, well, she needs me.

29:23.239 --> 29:25.328
I hope you guys can understand.

29:25.372 --> 29:27.940
Archie, of course
we understand.

29:27.983 --> 29:29.724
That's so sweet and thoughtful.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.900
I'm sorry we pressured you.

29:31.944 --> 29:33.989
Me, too. It was her idea.

29:34.033 --> 29:36.252
Well, you guys shouldn't
have to miss out

29:36.296 --> 29:38.124
on Valentine's Day
on account of me.

29:38.167 --> 29:39.952
I mean, there must be some
other guys you can go out with.

29:39.995 --> 29:41.867
Yeah, Betty,
find somebody else.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.912
No. No, it's really okay.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.479
There's an extra credit report

29:45.522 --> 29:47.133
that I've been
putting off, so...

29:47.176 --> 29:49.309
As for me, Mademoiselle
just published a recipe

29:49.352 --> 29:51.528
for an egg-white face mask
I've been dying to try.

29:51.572 --> 29:53.530
So that'll keep me busy.

29:53.574 --> 29:57.404
Okay, so you're both staying in
this Sunday night, then?

30:04.150 --> 30:06.326
[music playing on record]

30:06.369 --> 30:10.069
But when Sunday night
rolled around...

30:10.112 --> 30:14.116
Betty and Veronica decided
against staying in,

30:14.160 --> 30:16.815
and went on a Valentine's date,

30:16.858 --> 30:18.425
together.

30:20.122 --> 30:24.387
So, imagine their surprise
when who should walk in but...

30:28.217 --> 30:31.655
-He wouldn't.
-He couldn't.

30:31.699 --> 30:33.440
[both] That rat-fink!

30:39.141 --> 30:40.360
[Betty] Wait.

30:40.403 --> 30:42.057
Whatever you're about to do...

30:43.885 --> 30:45.713
I have a much better idea.

30:54.026 --> 30:56.985
Betty. Veronica.

30:57.029 --> 30:58.552
What's going on?

30:58.595 --> 31:00.641
We were wondering
how your Valentine's date went

31:00.684 --> 31:02.121
with your mom.

31:02.164 --> 31:04.993
Yeah, it was nice. Quiet.

31:06.429 --> 31:07.866
Why?

31:07.909 --> 31:10.738
Well, because a night-off
gave us a chance to reflect,

31:10.781 --> 31:13.393
and since you've been
having such a hard time

31:13.436 --> 31:15.961
deciding between the two of us,

31:16.004 --> 31:17.353
we were thinking...

31:18.833 --> 31:20.835
what if you had us both?

31:23.838 --> 31:26.362
At the exact same time,

31:26.406 --> 31:29.409
for a very, very special date?

31:31.628 --> 31:32.934
Really?

31:32.978 --> 31:34.022
[both] Really.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.113
Say no more.

31:38.157 --> 31:39.071
I'll pick you both up tonight,

31:39.114 --> 31:40.420
we'll head over
to Lover's Lane.

31:40.463 --> 31:43.118
I know the perfect spot.
Nice and private.

31:43.162 --> 31:46.861
Actually, Betty had
an interesting idea.

31:46.905 --> 31:50.169
I was thinking we could meet
in shop class.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.780
After hours, of course.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.042
Why would we go there?

31:54.086 --> 31:55.826
-[both chuckle]
-Don't you know?

31:56.740 --> 31:58.525
It's sound-proof.

31:58.568 --> 32:03.660
And we plan on making
a lot of noise.

32:10.145 --> 32:12.974
[both] Come, Archie. Join us.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.111
Wait.

32:19.154 --> 32:20.895
You're forgetting something.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.899
Your coffee.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.988
We took the liberty
of brewing it

32:27.032 --> 32:28.685
extra strong for you tonight.

32:28.729 --> 32:32.037
Oh, guys, I really don't think
I'm gonna need a boost tonight.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.865
Now, now, no need to posture.

32:34.909 --> 32:38.217
You'll want all your energy
for what we have planned.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.131
Promise.

32:39.174 --> 32:41.611
Cross our hearts
and hope to die.

32:47.835 --> 32:48.923
Mmm.

32:55.799 --> 32:58.585
[echoing] Everything all right,
Archiekins?

32:58.628 --> 33:00.674
[echoing]
Yeah, no, I'm good. I just...

33:13.643 --> 33:15.950
[normal]
Someone's waking up, Vee.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.170
[Veronica] I think
you're right, Bee.

33:18.213 --> 33:20.085
Welcome back, handsome.

33:22.391 --> 33:23.436
What's happening?

33:23.479 --> 33:24.785
Apologies if you're

33:24.828 --> 33:26.395
experiencing
a splitting headache.

33:26.439 --> 33:28.180
I wasn't sure how many
of my mom's sleeping pills

33:28.223 --> 33:29.790
to slip into your coffee.

33:29.833 --> 33:32.575
Whatever it is,
I'm sure we can figure it out.

33:32.619 --> 33:34.838
But it's already
been figured out, silly.

33:34.882 --> 33:37.276
Trust us.
This is a perfect solution.

33:37.319 --> 33:40.496
After all, a problem shared
is a problem solved.

33:40.540 --> 33:43.325
-Shall we, Vee?
-After you, Bee.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.414
Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait!

33:45.458 --> 33:48.069
Wait, hold on! Hold on!

33:51.159 --> 33:53.118
[screaming]

33:53.161 --> 33:56.295
Stop! Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

33:56.338 --> 33:59.472
This won't hurt... much.

33:59.515 --> 34:01.865
[both] We just want
to double our fun.

34:03.128 --> 34:04.303
[screaming]

34:13.094 --> 34:14.791
[splattering]

34:14.835 --> 34:16.576
[Key-Keeper] Here,
for the first time,

34:16.619 --> 34:19.795
Betty and Veronica
are with their beloved Archie

34:19.840 --> 34:22.842
on the same night
at the same time,

34:22.886 --> 34:26.324
secure in the knowledge
that they'll never have to

34:26.368 --> 34:28.762
share him again.

34:28.804 --> 34:32.547
Didn't I tell you
he was a half-wit?

34:32.592 --> 34:34.072
-[woman screaming]
-[Key-Keeper chuckling]

34:39.728 --> 34:41.208
Well?

34:41.253 --> 34:43.690
What did you think of that
tag-team twist at the end?

34:43.733 --> 34:47.085
O. Henry, eat your heart out,
am I right?

34:47.128 --> 34:50.739
I have... opinions.

34:50.784 --> 34:52.090
Okey-dokey.

34:53.743 --> 34:57.530
I'm detecting
a pattern, Jughead.

34:57.573 --> 35:00.750
The sexual politics
in most of your stories

35:00.794 --> 35:04.276
are troubling,
to say the least.

35:04.319 --> 35:06.974
[chuckles softly]
Veronica, my gosh,

35:07.844 --> 35:10.760
you may be overthinking this.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.893
These stories
are just meant to be a gas.

35:12.936 --> 35:14.416
For whom?

35:14.460 --> 35:17.115
Not teen girls, not when you're
depicting them like...

35:18.377 --> 35:21.119
shallow, crazy killers.

35:21.162 --> 35:22.468
Is that what you think of us?

35:23.295 --> 35:25.297
No. Of course not.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.560
The boys
aren't great shakes, either.

35:27.603 --> 35:29.910
So you admit
you're demonizing women?

35:29.953 --> 35:33.218
Veronica, it's just
a comic book.

35:40.573 --> 35:44.098
Anyhoo, I'm done now.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.231
Why don't we try to catch
that last showing of Diabolique

35:46.274 --> 35:47.493
at the Babylonium?

35:47.536 --> 35:49.277
What do you say? My treat.

35:49.321 --> 35:54.413
I think I'll take a page
from your last story

35:54.456 --> 35:55.979
and split.

35:58.156 --> 36:01.159
What's going on?
Are we not copacetic anymore?

36:01.202 --> 36:02.377
Of course we are.

36:02.421 --> 36:05.075
I'm just tired, is all.

36:05.119 --> 36:07.208
I'll catch you
at school tomorrow, promise.

36:08.557 --> 36:10.994
[Jughead] And as easy as that,

36:11.038 --> 36:16.783
whatever bubble Veronica and I
had been in, just burst.

36:16.826 --> 36:21.222
Tomorrow, at school,
things would be different.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.442
We'd no longer be
the Marilyn Monroe

36:23.485 --> 36:25.705
and Arthur Miller
of Riverdale High.

36:25.748 --> 36:27.446
We'd pass each other
in the hall,

36:27.489 --> 36:29.274
but she'd once again be
the beautiful socialite,

36:29.317 --> 36:32.190
and I'd be the melvin
who writes comic books.

36:32.233 --> 36:36.716
The kind that hopefully
weren't corrupting
the youth of America.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.805
[Featherhead] "Don't be fooled
by their name.

36:38.848 --> 36:40.981
These publications
are anything but comic.

36:41.024 --> 36:44.202
In their pages,
crime is glorified.

36:44.245 --> 36:49.076
Acts of wanton carnality
are celebrated.

36:49.119 --> 36:53.254
Stabbings and beheadings
and disembowelings
are commonplace,

36:53.298 --> 36:54.777
vividly depicted,

36:54.821 --> 36:57.954
and offered up to our children
like so much bubblegum.

36:57.998 --> 37:00.435
If anyone doubts
the insidious effects

37:00.479 --> 37:01.784
of this subversive medium,

37:01.828 --> 37:04.352
let me stress
what my extensive research

37:04.396 --> 37:05.788
has proven time and again.

37:05.832 --> 37:08.574
There's a direct
and undeniable link

37:08.617 --> 37:11.446
between gruesome acts
of brutality depicted

37:11.490 --> 37:13.100
in the pages of comic books,

37:13.143 --> 37:16.321
and similar acts of savagery
committed in real life

37:16.364 --> 37:19.846
by the juveniles
who read these comics books.

37:19.889 --> 37:21.804
Our children are being seduced

37:21.848 --> 37:26.592
-by violence, by sex,
by depravity.
-[typewriter clacking]

37:26.635 --> 37:29.377
Their innocence
must be preserved

37:29.421 --> 37:31.292
by any means necessary."

37:32.380 --> 37:34.469
I congratulate you,
Dr. Werthers.

37:34.513 --> 37:36.558
That's a brilliant editorial.

37:36.602 --> 37:39.953
The soon-to-be-forgotten
Muggs murders,

37:39.996 --> 37:42.129
small potatoes compared
to the threat to America

37:42.172 --> 37:44.305
that you have outlined
here for us tonight.

37:44.349 --> 37:45.611
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

37:45.654 --> 37:48.744
I consider it my civic
and moral duty.

37:48.788 --> 37:51.660
That's why
these so-called creators

37:51.704 --> 37:56.578
of these dangerous and morally
reprehensible stories

37:56.622 --> 37:58.145
must be held accountable

37:58.188 --> 38:01.757
and punished to the full extent
of the law.

38:05.152 --> 38:06.849
[Fieldstone] I've been reading
your stories, Jones.

38:06.893 --> 38:08.547
I gotta say, I love 'em.

38:08.590 --> 38:10.070
This is incredible stuff.

38:10.113 --> 38:12.290
Thank you, Mr. Fieldstone.
I, um...

38:13.465 --> 38:14.944
I needed a win today.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.772
Oh, how come?

38:16.816 --> 38:19.906
Ah, let me guess.
Girl trouble?

38:20.472 --> 38:22.125
Yeah.

38:22.169 --> 38:25.694
I... kinda had
this sweet thing going
with this one gal,

38:25.738 --> 38:28.480
but then she read
my comics and, um...

38:29.481 --> 38:31.831
Well, she took it
the wrong way.

38:31.874 --> 38:33.876
I don't think she liked
what I was saying.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.574
I don't even know
what that means.

38:35.617 --> 38:36.705
But you busted your ass

38:36.749 --> 38:39.795
to turn those stories
around overnight.

38:39.839 --> 38:41.362
And I think you deserve

38:41.406 --> 38:42.885
a little something extra
for that.

38:42.929 --> 38:45.453
-A bonus?
-God, no. What are you, nuts?

38:45.497 --> 38:47.499
No, I'm thinking, um, credit.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.283
-Your name...
-On the cover?

38:49.327 --> 38:52.547
God, no. A byline.

38:52.591 --> 38:55.333
-On the inside. But still...
-It's my name in print.

38:55.376 --> 38:58.640
Oh, golly, that would be
incredible, Mr. Fieldstone.

38:58.684 --> 39:00.163
I mean, my friends would flip.

39:00.207 --> 39:03.297
How does
Jughead "Jugular" Jones

39:03.341 --> 39:04.907
sound for a byline?

39:04.951 --> 39:07.649
Oh... [whistles]
I'm crazy for it.

39:07.693 --> 39:08.911
[laughs] Yeah.

39:08.955 --> 39:10.783
Now, you listen to me, kid,

39:10.826 --> 39:13.525
I don't know much,
but I do know this.

39:13.568 --> 39:15.527
Girls come and go.

39:15.570 --> 39:17.398
But your name in print,

39:17.442 --> 39:21.620
now that's a thing
that'll make people
sit up and take notice.

39:21.663 --> 39:24.100
[Jughead] Little did
any of us imagine
how prophetic

39:24.144 --> 39:26.755
Mr. Fieldstone's words
would turn out to be.

39:28.409 --> 39:29.497
[screeching]

39:31.281 --> 39:32.500
[woman screaming]
