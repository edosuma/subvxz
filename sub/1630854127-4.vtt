WEBVTT

00:43.710 --> 00:45.003
Found something, sir.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.134
I believe this is part of a femur.

00:51.926 --> 00:54.971
<i> So, the remains they found</i>
<i>in your dad's backyard, they…</i>

00:55.930 --> 00:58.349
corroborate your story
about that first victim.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.437
The hitchhiker?

01:03.271 --> 01:04.272
That's right.

01:05.607 --> 01:09.194
And, uh, why did you
scatter the bones around?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.155
Was it just to get rid of the evidence?

01:12.238 --> 01:13.490
Um…

01:14.491 --> 01:15.533
Well,

01:16.993 --> 01:20.455
I just kinda panicked at that point.

01:21.581 --> 01:22.832
I, uh…

01:23.374 --> 01:25.376
I tried smashin' the bones,

01:26.294 --> 01:29.089
but the insides, uh, were…

01:30.215 --> 01:32.133
wet, you know.

01:33.384 --> 01:36.137
Couldn't, uh, smash 'em into a powder.

01:36.721 --> 01:37.847
So I, uh…

01:39.724 --> 01:42.811
Then I decided to put 'em in the oven,

01:43.311 --> 01:46.064
to, uh, you know,

01:46.689 --> 01:51.402
dry 'em out and, uh, that did the trick.

01:52.195 --> 01:55.573
Then I could smash 'em into bits.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.662
But why scatter the bones
around the entire yard?

02:03.331 --> 02:06.084
I think I just
wanted him to still be around.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.256
Like the idea of…

02:12.465 --> 02:15.135
little pieces of him
being everywhere, you know?

02:15.802 --> 02:17.137
Surrounding me.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.643
I know that sounds horrible.

02:26.604 --> 02:29.440
Well, Jeff, it actually
doesn't matter what we think.

02:34.320 --> 02:38.700
But… I do think I was born like this.

02:40.827 --> 02:45.748
Like, I don't think there was something
that happened that made me like this.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.169
'Cause this was always just

02:50.253 --> 02:51.629
how I was.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.509
'Cause, uh…

02:57.635 --> 02:59.304
after the hitchhiker…

03:00.847 --> 03:03.308
I didn't wanna do it again for a while.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.810
Or I wanted to.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.814
I thought about doing it, a lot sometimes,

03:10.440 --> 03:14.861
but, uh, I was able to push it down.

03:16.112 --> 03:19.574
And it didn't happen again for, um…

03:21.868 --> 03:23.077
nine years.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.581
It's interesting.

03:27.957 --> 03:33.379
That psychologist, or psychiatrist,
you guys got me talkin' to,

03:36.007 --> 03:39.344
he said something
that really stuck with me.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.971
<i> So as you</i>
<i>were cutting your victims up,</i>

03:43.097 --> 03:45.099
was it sexually arousing for you?

03:49.437 --> 03:50.438
Oh, yeah.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.900
-Very much so.
-Yeah.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.110
I, uh…

03:57.362 --> 04:00.949
I liked how
the organs looked when I held them.

04:03.243 --> 04:07.038
They had a, uh, a shine to 'em.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.126
There's a term for what you're describing.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.045
It's called splanchnophilia.

04:14.879 --> 04:18.299
When someone finds viscera,
internal organs, sexually arousing.

04:19.300 --> 04:24.097
And this shininess you describe enjoying
is one of its main components.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.101
Human beings, and men in particular,

04:28.184 --> 04:31.104
we tend to like our objects shiny.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.982
And there's a sexual aspect to it as well.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.944
You open a swimsuit issue,
the women are all wet.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.445
It's like we're drawn to it.

04:40.196 --> 04:43.825
It could be that wetness,
with regards to the vagina,

04:43.908 --> 04:46.369
is a signal
of a woman's readiness for sex.

04:46.869 --> 04:48.955
We could very well be hardwired for it.

04:49.747 --> 04:50.623
Hm.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.001
But if this
was something you were born with,

04:53.084 --> 04:56.671
this compulsion
that you struggled with all the time,

04:57.588 --> 05:00.300
how did you wait
those nine years in between?

05:00.883 --> 05:02.176
Or why?

05:02.260 --> 05:04.262
Oh, I was trying to be a good boy.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.980
Okay, now. Front row,
Tina, Andrew, Mark Norton,

05:14.063 --> 05:17.317
Sasha, Andrea, Mark D'Angelo, Dan.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.736
Okay, let's all squeeze in.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.283
Congratulations, everybody, by the way.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.035
You're the cream of the crop, huh?

05:27.118 --> 05:28.202
Okay.

05:28.911 --> 05:31.414
Everyone smile and…

05:32.582 --> 05:35.418
Great. Let's get one more.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.339
-Very good, guys. Thank you.
-Okay.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.091
Tina, you stay. Ecology Club is next.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.720
<i>Oh my God, they're beautiful.</i>

05:45.803 --> 05:47.805
They look amazing. Congrats, Derek.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.224
Thanks.
Such great work, everybody.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.435
-Layout looks great, Dan.
-Thanks.

05:52.518 --> 05:56.939
Hold on. Wait a sec.
Turn to page 36, the Honor Society photo.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.449
-What the fuck? How did he get in there?
-I don't know.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.701
Dan, how did you not catch this?

06:08.785 --> 06:10.787
I'm sorry.
I didn't see him in the photo.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.413
That's your goddamn job, Dan.

06:12.497 --> 06:15.708
Jeff Dahmer
has like a two GPA, Dan!

06:15.792 --> 06:17.502
Motherfucker!

07:05.133 --> 07:06.759
She's not gonna blow her top.

07:06.843 --> 07:07.677
Yes, she will.

07:07.760 --> 07:12.056
I'm just apologizing in advance
for dragging you into family stuff,

07:12.140 --> 07:13.015
you know.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.060
Well, what's she got to be upset about?

07:16.144 --> 07:19.313
You were miserable,
you got divorced, you're moving on.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.899
She should be happy for you.
She should be moving on.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.735
That's the thing, Shari,
she doesn't want me to be happy.

07:25.570 --> 07:29.490
And, uh, when I bring
a hot babe into the house,

07:29.574 --> 07:31.742
she's gonna lose it, believe me.

07:31.826 --> 07:34.412
Well, so what if she does?

07:34.495 --> 07:35.913
I can handle it.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.791
I'll just blow my top right back at her.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.002
I'm a tough cookie,
in case you hadn't noticed.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.879
Mmm. I had noticed.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.551
Would you keep your eyes on the road?

07:59.979 --> 08:00.897
Joyce?

08:04.942 --> 08:06.068
Jeez.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.280
This house looks like a tornado hit it.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.576
Didn't know
you guys were comin'.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.582
What the heck's going on here?

08:20.583 --> 08:22.293
What's with all the alcohol, Jeff?

08:24.003 --> 08:26.380
Just threw a party.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.591
Well, look around, why don't you?

08:29.091 --> 08:30.635
This place is a mess!

08:33.763 --> 08:34.764
So is this her?

08:39.977 --> 08:40.978
Shari.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.232
This is Jeff. Jeez, Jeff.

08:45.024 --> 08:45.858
Hi, Jeff.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.819
-Hi.
-Where's your mom at?

08:51.155 --> 08:53.032
I don't know. She left.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.367
Well, where'd she go?

08:56.244 --> 08:57.245
I don't know.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.455
Well, when did she leave?

09:00.706 --> 09:03.000
Like three months ago.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.088
I'm sorry, what?

09:07.630 --> 09:10.633
It's always the same with her.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.553
The only person
she's thought of is herself.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.515
And here, she's leaving
an 18-year-old boy alone in the house.

09:17.598 --> 09:20.977
Nobody to cook for him or anything.
God knows what you've been eating.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.605
Honestly, it's criminal.
That she would do that…

09:25.106 --> 09:27.942
-Goddammit. Excuse me.
-Dad.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.070
I'm okay.

09:31.153 --> 09:32.613
No, Jeff, you're not okay.

09:34.448 --> 09:35.658
You've been drinking.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.203
I saw the empty cans,
and I smell it on you.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.538
You're not okay.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.208
Come on, I want you to drink that.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.502
I don't like coffee.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.880
Yeah, well, I need you to sober up
because this is important.

09:49.964 --> 09:53.801
We have to figure out how
we're gonna get your life in order, okay?

09:55.428 --> 09:56.345
Okay?

10:07.481 --> 10:08.566
Oh.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.068
That's an awful lot of sugar, Jeff.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.616
What do you care? You're not my mom.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.492
-I just met you.
-Jeff.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.995
-No, Lionel, it's okay. It's okay.
-I don't know what to say.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.581
You're right, Jeff. I'm not your mom.

10:24.498 --> 10:28.002
But I love your father,
which means I love you.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.045
Okay?

10:29.920 --> 10:32.506
Sometimes that's gonna come
in the form of tough love.

10:47.104 --> 10:50.816
Well, you managed to graduate.
That's, um, that's an accomplishment.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.694
Barely. But yeah.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.072
You apply to any colleges?

10:56.822 --> 10:57.657
No.

10:58.699 --> 11:02.036
You know, Jeff… I mean, what the heck…?

11:02.119 --> 11:03.746
What have you been doing?

11:03.829 --> 11:06.624
-It's probably too late now.
-That's why I didn't apply.

11:07.958 --> 11:08.876
Jeff.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.463
You know, you were always
so good at science. It's…

11:12.546 --> 11:13.964
I don't, I don't know.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.468
I know most of the guys who are going
to college for science, and they get…

11:19.845 --> 11:21.764
they get good grades and stuff.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.391
My grades are shit.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.060
Well, what about community college?

11:26.560 --> 11:28.437
Community college, that's, like,

11:29.730 --> 11:31.273
for failures.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.736
Well, I mean,
that might be where we're at.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.497
Yeah.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.208
But, like, uh…

11:55.423 --> 11:56.757
That's what I am.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.058
Why am I trying to pretend
to be something I'm not?

12:11.021 --> 12:12.064
You know?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.111
I'm

12:18.487 --> 12:20.072
not a good kid.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.075
Dad, I'm not a normal guy.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.245
I don't fit in. I'm weird. I don't…

12:27.204 --> 12:30.624
I'm different from everybody else.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.922
-There's something wrong with me, I think.
-Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, just come on.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.758
-Don't. This is--
No, I'm serious, Dad.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.761
There's things that I want to do, and…

12:45.097 --> 12:47.641
And there's stuff
that I've done that I, uh…

12:50.895 --> 12:52.146
I don't know.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.983
I think I should tell you about…

13:02.698 --> 13:03.699
About, uh…

13:05.868 --> 13:09.371
About some of the fantasies that I've had.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.873
Okay, so, wait a minute.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.087
Is this sex stuff
you're talkin' about here?

13:20.758 --> 13:23.552
Yeah. That's part of it.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.722
You know what? Hey, I'm sorry.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.099
-I just got an idea. Just…
-What?

13:29.183 --> 13:30.184
Um…

13:33.979 --> 13:35.314
-Ohio State.
-Oh.

13:37.733 --> 13:42.196
We're gonna get him into Ohio State.
We are. Gonna get you into Ohio State.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.866
Huh? Yeah, I'll even
pay for the first semester.

13:45.950 --> 13:46.951
Oh.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.870
Got a great science program.

13:51.622 --> 13:52.498
What do you think?

13:53.958 --> 13:54.959
Huh?

13:55.042 --> 13:55.876
I think…

13:57.753 --> 13:59.338
I think that sounds good.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.006
Good.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.969
It's decided then.
That's what we're gonna do.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.512
-Okay.
-What do you think?

14:06.595 --> 14:09.014
I think it's a great idea.
Are you kidding?

14:10.099 --> 14:11.100
Aw.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.474
<i>You better be having</i>
<i>the time of your life.</i>

14:52.558 --> 14:55.477
It sounds like you are,
for goodness' sakes.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.815
All the money we gave you to come here,
and now I get a call from the dean.

15:00.441 --> 15:04.904
Okay, I'm just gonna cut to the chase.
Is Jeff going to class?

15:04.987 --> 15:05.988
No.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.076
It's all these morning classes.
I can't wake up for 'em.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.996
What's your GPA?

15:16.206 --> 15:18.042
Jeff's GPA is a 0.45.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.877
Oh, Jesus.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.713
Jesus.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.180
Okay.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.060
We're gonna get those grades up.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.187
Mr. Dahmer, you don't understand.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.022
Jeff has been expelled.

15:45.861 --> 15:48.155
Dad. Wait up. You're walking too fast.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.075
You're going in the fucking Army.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.509
There he is.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.889
Oh, well, look at that.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.557
Look at him.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.643
-Who is that?

16:17.726 --> 16:18.560
Hey, guys.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.938
-Hi, Dad.
-So handsome.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.606
-Shari. How are you?
-Oh my gosh.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.149
-Hi, Jeff.
-Good to see you.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.609
Dad.

16:28.278 --> 16:31.490
Jeff, gosh. You just… You look just great.

16:31.573 --> 16:32.908
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

16:33.993 --> 16:34.994
It's good to be home.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.332
-Come on. Come on in.

16:44.294 --> 16:45.796
So, how you liking it?

16:46.755 --> 16:49.258
Uh, yeah, I like it all right.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.011
-Glad basic training's over.
-Oh.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.013
So what do they got you doing?

16:54.930 --> 16:58.392
Well, I… I trained
to be a medical specialist.

16:58.475 --> 17:01.145
So I'll be probably doing,
like, combat medic stuff.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.980
-Medical specialist. You hear that?
-Ah!

17:03.063 --> 17:04.773
-A combat medic!
-Jeff.

17:05.357 --> 17:10.446
These are hypnotic medications
that ensure adequate rest and recovery.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.615
Yes, Dahmer.

17:14.533 --> 17:15.784
Which one was that again?

17:15.868 --> 17:16.994
What was the name?

17:17.077 --> 17:18.120
Halcion.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.415
We get great results. Very effective.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.292
<i> You see, son, I told you.</i>

17:23.375 --> 17:25.961
All that science stuff
you've been interested in your whole life,

17:26.045 --> 17:27.838
I knew it was gonna pay off for you.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.131
Well, you were right.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.218
Come on, let's eat.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.749
So you fitting in? Making friends?

18:04.541 --> 18:05.375
Oh, yeah.

18:15.469 --> 18:16.470
Hey, Tanner.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.680
Wanna party?

18:18.764 --> 18:21.934
The guys are real nice. Making friends.

19:37.467 --> 19:41.597
They're shipping me off
to, uh, West Germany next week.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.808
Like, someplace
called Baumholder or something.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.268
You hear that, Shar?

19:46.351 --> 19:47.978
-Man, Jeff!
-Ha!

19:48.562 --> 19:49.521
Wow.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.524
Maybe you'll run into

19:53.400 --> 19:57.112
some of your relatives,
you know, from the old country.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.572
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

19:59.615 --> 20:00.782
-Gotta look 'em up.
-Yep.

20:03.702 --> 20:04.661
Wow.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.165
Germany.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.586
Can you believe it?

20:35.567 --> 20:39.321
Hey! Get your ass out of the car. Now!

20:55.504 --> 20:59.174
Okay, before we go in,
I just want to make myself very clear.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.342
You understand?

21:00.425 --> 21:02.970
This ain't easy street.
You're 21 years old.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.264
You flunked out
and got kicked out of the Army.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.557
There's no more free rides.
There's no drinking.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.643
You're gonna get yourself a full-time job

21:09.726 --> 21:12.062
and you're gonna help your grandma
around the house.

21:14.189 --> 21:15.274
You got that?!

21:17.401 --> 21:18.443
Yes, sir.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.530
<i> Grandma, what's in this box?</i>

22:05.699 --> 22:09.703
Oh, those are photos of your father.
You want to take a look?

22:10.829 --> 22:12.122
Yeah.

22:12.205 --> 22:14.249
Just turn this key right here.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.752
It's a nice click.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.088
Oh!

22:22.883 --> 22:24.509
Here's your father.

22:25.469 --> 22:29.097
I can't remember
what birthday that was. Maybe five?

22:29.973 --> 22:34.311
Oh. Look at him. Such a dear, dear boy.

22:35.812 --> 22:40.275
Now, here, that's the science fair.

22:40.901 --> 22:44.196
He's holding up a ribbon,
so he must have won a prize.

22:47.657 --> 22:49.409
Here, he's much older.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.162
This is a family reunion

22:52.245 --> 22:56.708
at your Great-Uncle Roland's house
in Stevens Point.

22:57.667 --> 23:01.254
He was a good boy,
your father, his whole life.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.510
Wish I had a box like that.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.138
Well, you could have this one, I suppose.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.724
What do you need a box for?

23:14.017 --> 23:15.310
No, I mean,

23:16.269 --> 23:19.856
I don't even have any memories
like that to put in a box.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.778
I haven't won a ribbon
for anything my whole life.

23:26.780 --> 23:30.283
Like a… a bad egg.

23:31.618 --> 23:33.954
I got a screw loose up here or something.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.041
Jeff Dahmer, you look at me.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.420
There isn't a thing wrong with you
that we can't fix.

23:41.920 --> 23:45.048
I think you just need
to find a nice girl, that's all.

23:50.637 --> 23:53.932
And also, there's the drinking.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.768
Now, that is a problem.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.479
I've hardly been drinking at all, Grandma.

23:59.980 --> 24:03.775
I still think you could do better,
wouldn't you say?

24:04.276 --> 24:08.488
And I know I'm just
a worn-out, broken record here, but

24:09.531 --> 24:12.242
I think you should start
coming back to church again.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.203
Uh-huh.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.872
Uh-huh.

24:17.747 --> 24:20.041
Because the things you do
that set you off course,

24:20.125 --> 24:21.626
the alcohol,

24:21.710 --> 24:25.505
the keeping to yourself
and stewing in your own thoughts,

24:26.089 --> 24:28.133
those are temptations, Jeff.

24:29.176 --> 24:32.929
And I think if you came back to church,
it would help you understand

24:33.013 --> 24:35.182
and resist those temptations.

24:39.769 --> 24:43.064
What do you think's tempting me?
The devil?

24:45.192 --> 24:47.903
Yeah. Absolutely, I do.

24:49.279 --> 24:52.824
You're a good boy, Jeff.
You're every bit as good as your father.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.953
You just have different challenges
than he did.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.415
Everybody's got something different
they're fighting with.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.126
You're good deep down, Jeff.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.004
You may not believe it, but I sure do.

25:11.259 --> 25:12.427
Thanks, Grandma.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.156
So, you work in deli before?

25:34.866 --> 25:36.785
Yeah, in Miami.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.454
Just making sandwiches and stuff.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.499
Okay, you're making sandwiches too,
but this is Polish deli,

25:42.582 --> 25:46.086
so you're doing sausages
and preparing the meats.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.046
It's an art to be a butcher.

25:49.297 --> 25:51.132
Never thought about it like that.

25:51.633 --> 25:53.009
Of course it's an art.

25:53.093 --> 25:56.388
I am butcher.
I am learning in Poland from my father.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.515
His father was butcher.

25:58.598 --> 26:00.559
It's bloody work. It's dangerous.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.728
Last guy, he was dumb. Not pay attention.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.063
Guy cut off his thumb.

26:05.146 --> 26:07.315
So I need someone who's serious.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.193
Steady hand, not going to fuck around.

26:12.112 --> 26:14.698
Yeah, I got a real steady hand
with that kind of stuff.

26:16.866 --> 26:19.786
I pay minimum wage,
no overtime, and you gotta look nice.

26:19.869 --> 26:23.039
Even you in back,
you in nice clothes, okay?

26:24.499 --> 26:26.084
-Okay.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.752
Come. I show you freezer.

26:31.172 --> 26:32.424
Jeff.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.302
Aw. Thanks, Grandma.

26:35.385 --> 26:37.929
Could you just
leave the sheets outside my door?

26:38.013 --> 26:39.848
Kinda like to make my own bed.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.730
Thanks, Grandma.

27:33.109 --> 27:35.570
Hey, Grandma. I'm home.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.121
Grandma!

27:48.833 --> 27:51.252
-Grandma, where's my thing?
-What?

27:51.336 --> 27:54.964
You know, my… mannequin.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.218
What do you have that for?

27:58.301 --> 27:59.844
Where'd you get that?

28:01.596 --> 28:03.598
I'm not telling
till you tell me where it is.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.266
What do you have that for, Jeff?

28:07.143 --> 28:09.187
Jeff, I want to tell you something.

28:09.270 --> 28:11.773
I love you no matter what.

28:11.856 --> 28:16.027
Do you have, you know, feelings for--

28:16.111 --> 28:17.570
No, I don't want to talk about that.

28:17.654 --> 28:21.241
We could go to church and pray about it
because Jesus Christ can do amazing--

28:21.324 --> 28:24.953
Where is my fucking mannequin?

28:25.745 --> 28:27.747
I told you not to go in there!

28:27.831 --> 28:30.625
It is my room, it is my stuff,

28:30.709 --> 28:32.544
so fucking tell me where it is!

28:32.627 --> 28:34.212
I don't think it's healthy!

28:36.172 --> 28:38.007
I… I threw it away.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.139
You threw it away?

28:44.639 --> 28:48.560
Yes. The garbage man
took it this afternoon.

28:56.276 --> 29:00.447
Goddammit! God-fucking-dammit!

29:11.207 --> 29:14.127
<i>Two X's,</i>
<i>two O's on the board, $900 in the pot.</i>

29:14.210 --> 29:15.670
<i>Let's shuffle the categories.</i>

29:18.131 --> 29:20.175
<i>I'll take "Jim and James" to block.</i>

29:20.258 --> 29:22.761
<i> Yeah. You need</i>
<i>to block Bob with this answer.</i>

29:22.844 --> 29:26.097
<i>Author James Clavell</i>
<i>wrote a very successful novel,</i>

29:26.181 --> 29:29.058
<i>which became one of the big hits</i>
<i>of the 1980 television scene.</i>

29:29.559 --> 29:34.731
<i>The story deals with a shipwrecked</i>
<i>English navigator in 17th-century Japan.</i>

29:34.814 --> 29:35.982
I'm…

29:36.065 --> 29:37.317
<i>Correct! </i>Shōgun.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.861
…really sorry, Grandma.

29:43.114 --> 29:44.866
I shouldn't have yelled like that.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.579
And I'm sorry I broke your butter dish.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.043
It's not

29:56.377 --> 29:57.712
like you said I am.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.842
I would never bring shame
on the family like that.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.224
I think I just…

30:11.810 --> 30:13.061
want a friend.

30:16.189 --> 30:18.233
Well, I accept your apology.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.860
But I don't like the cursing.

30:21.986 --> 30:22.946
I know.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.908
<i>Take a look at this picture, Miriam.</i>

30:26.991 --> 30:31.412
<i>This river flows through one of Europe's</i>
<i>most picturesque capital cities.</i>

30:31.496 --> 30:34.999
You know what?
The state fair is coming up.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.420
You used to love it when you were a kid.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.801
And it's not like it used to be,
all farm animals

30:44.884 --> 30:47.637
and rolling cheese wheels down the hill.

30:48.388 --> 30:52.141
Uh, they got a beer tent and everything.

30:52.892 --> 30:54.269
There's a beer tent?

32:28.988 --> 32:30.114
Hi, Jeff.

32:34.535 --> 32:35.828
You're alive.

32:37.622 --> 32:38.539
Yeah.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.979
Nope, uh-uh! Get out!

33:02.188 --> 33:03.272
I got my shift.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.942
No. Jeff, I heard what happened
at the state fair.

33:06.025 --> 33:10.029
I can't have you in here. No, get out!

33:16.452 --> 33:18.287
<i>So that was your job in the Army?</i>

33:19.664 --> 33:21.624
Uh, yes, a, uh, combat medic.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.960
Or medical specialist, they call it.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.129
Oh wow, okay.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.756
You're probably a perfect fit then.

33:29.257 --> 33:32.760
I see you were honorably discharged.
Can I ask why?

33:34.220 --> 33:35.930
Uh…

33:37.098 --> 33:40.643
Well, to be honest
I had a little trouble with alcohol.

33:40.727 --> 33:43.354
But, uh, I'm sober now.

33:43.855 --> 33:47.108
I see. Good for you.

33:47.817 --> 33:48.901
Thanks.

33:49.402 --> 33:52.947
Going to meetings and stuff.
Just one day at a time.

33:53.614 --> 33:57.493
That's really great. Congratulations.

33:57.577 --> 33:58.828
Thanks.

33:58.911 --> 34:02.081
You might actually be
a little overqualified for this position.

34:07.170 --> 34:10.048
Doug, uh, Brozovsky.

34:10.131 --> 34:11.257
That's me.

34:17.597 --> 34:18.890
Make a fist.

34:22.518 --> 34:23.644
Good veins.

34:24.145 --> 34:25.063
Thanks.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.110
Can you relax?

34:44.707 --> 34:46.918
I used to do this all the time.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.713
Get my blood drawn.

34:51.714 --> 34:53.299
I donated it.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.636
It's how I got my beer money.

35:00.598 --> 35:03.059
Did it so much,
they told me I couldn't do it anymore.

35:08.940 --> 35:09.899
Okay.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.820
<i>I am so proud of you.</i>

35:14.487 --> 35:19.200
You quit drinking,
and this new job is working out.

35:19.283 --> 35:20.993
Medical! Ha!

35:21.744 --> 35:23.329
Have you talked to your father?

35:24.247 --> 35:25.123
No.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.792
He thinks I'm a shithead.

35:28.918 --> 35:29.961
Sorry to curse.

35:30.044 --> 35:32.421
Oh, no he doesn't.

35:33.089 --> 35:37.135
I mean, he's angry
about you getting arrested.

35:37.677 --> 35:40.555
A misdemeanor. Seventy-dollar fine.

35:41.222 --> 35:45.059
It's my fault too
for telling you about the beer tent,

35:45.143 --> 35:48.437
but that's behind you now,
is all I'm saying.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.316
What's going on?

35:52.817 --> 35:55.278
You're not even eating
your little brownie.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.697
That's the best part of a Swanson's.

35:59.198 --> 36:02.785
Oh, I'm just not that hungry tonight.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.253
Think I'm gonna go upstairs, Grandma.

36:12.753 --> 36:13.796
I'm beat.

36:20.469 --> 36:21.971
Sorry for wasting.

38:32.852 --> 38:34.061
Good luck.

38:35.730 --> 38:36.605
What?

38:36.689 --> 38:39.734
I said "good luck."
It's impossible to get his attention.

38:44.447 --> 38:45.614
You want a beer?

38:46.741 --> 38:49.744
It's for my buddy, but he might have left.
Think he found a friend.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.163
It's yours if you want it.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.126
Yeah. Thanks.

38:58.461 --> 38:59.420
Charles.

39:00.379 --> 39:01.255
Jeff.

39:08.429 --> 39:11.265
Well, Jeff, they're closing.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.353
Well, let's… let's go do something.

39:15.936 --> 39:18.939
You and me. Whatever you want.

39:21.942 --> 39:23.235
I was gonna go out.

39:24.612 --> 39:25.654
You wanna come with?

39:32.870 --> 39:34.705
-Hey, Ricky. Large room.
-Hey.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.066
Can I…?

40:46.735 --> 40:47.736
Sorry.

40:48.904 --> 40:52.992
I just don't have
a lot of experience at this.

40:55.035 --> 40:58.414
That's okay. That's sexy.

40:58.497 --> 40:59.415
Wait.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.594
Do you mind if we just, uh…

41:12.845 --> 41:14.889
lay down there on the bed?

41:17.433 --> 41:18.893
And I can hold you.

41:24.106 --> 41:25.191
Of course.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.110
We can start there.

41:38.287 --> 41:41.373
That's nice.

41:44.335 --> 41:45.377
Yeah.

42:08.817 --> 42:09.860
Where you going?

42:09.944 --> 42:13.781
It's 7:30. I gotta work.

42:16.659 --> 42:20.371
Can't you just stay a little bit?
I was really enjoying this.

42:20.454 --> 42:23.290
No. I gotta work.

42:47.856 --> 42:48.691
Hey, Ricky.

42:48.774 --> 42:50.943
-Hi, Jeff.
-One room.

42:52.069 --> 42:53.737
You're becoming a regular.

43:06.458 --> 43:07.793
What do you wanna do?

43:08.919 --> 43:10.170
Take your shirt off.

43:15.801 --> 43:17.803
-You look nice.
-So do you.

43:17.886 --> 43:20.180
Wait. Stay here.

43:21.473 --> 43:23.183
I'll get us some drinks first.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.187
Hey, Jeff.

43:27.271 --> 43:29.690
-Two whisky Cokes, please.
-Coming right up.

43:54.757 --> 43:55.799
Cheers.

44:10.356 --> 44:12.441
-This way.
-All right.

44:13.942 --> 44:16.612
This guy comes in here.
It's the second time he's done it.

44:16.695 --> 44:19.365
He slips them a mickey,
and he just leaves them here.

44:19.865 --> 44:23.285
The last time, we got the guy up,
but this kid's unresponsive.

44:27.665 --> 44:28.957
-Let's get him.
-Okay.

44:37.549 --> 44:38.550
Thank you.

44:41.762 --> 44:45.015
-Hey, Ricky.
-Get the fuck outta here.

44:46.308 --> 44:48.143
You should run away from this guy now.

44:48.227 --> 44:50.688
He brings guys in here, and he drugs them.

44:51.271 --> 44:53.857
And don't think you
can go to Empire or Roman Bath.

44:53.941 --> 44:55.150
I told 'em about you.

44:55.234 --> 44:58.987
You're blacklisted.
Get the fuck outta my bathhouse.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.574
Hey. Hey, wait.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.120
I said get the fuck outta here.

45:06.203 --> 45:07.204
I didn't do anything.

45:07.287 --> 45:09.415
-Get the fuck outta here!
-I didn't do anything!

45:09.498 --> 45:12.084
Get your fucking hands off me!

45:13.168 --> 45:14.628
You want me to call the cops?

45:17.923 --> 45:20.134
Excuse me. Card, please.

45:34.690 --> 45:36.817
I'm going to church now.

45:38.235 --> 45:39.236
Okay.

45:41.196 --> 45:43.824
I'd like you to come with me, Jeff.

45:46.326 --> 45:50.539
I know you got fired,
and that's real disappointing.

45:51.415 --> 45:54.918
And you've been drinking again.
Don't say you haven't.

45:56.086 --> 46:01.133
Your father's thrown up his hands,
and that's real hard for you.

46:02.050 --> 46:07.431
But you know, there's another father
who will never let you down.

46:08.098 --> 46:09.767
The Heavenly Father.

46:11.018 --> 46:11.977
No.

46:14.563 --> 46:16.023
I don't believe in God.

46:17.566 --> 46:20.319
You take that back.

46:24.615 --> 46:25.783
I won't.

47:01.026 --> 47:02.611
Two shots of Jack, please?

47:12.371 --> 47:13.413
Thanks.

47:31.181 --> 47:32.307
It's for you.

47:32.975 --> 47:34.309
You're the hottest guy here.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.563
You got killer dances moves.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.399
Wish I could dance like you.

47:42.901 --> 47:44.152
Well, show me what you got.

47:47.072 --> 47:48.699
No, I really couldn't.

47:48.782 --> 47:50.826
Come on, you got it. Come on.

47:54.872 --> 47:57.374
Hold on, hold on
You're gonna hurt someone.

47:57.457 --> 47:58.584
Just start right here.

47:59.376 --> 48:02.379
Yeah. Feel the music.

48:19.730 --> 48:22.858
Hey, Jeff,
I don't think I can afford this.

48:23.483 --> 48:26.111
Well, no, it's my treat.

48:26.194 --> 48:28.071
Why don't we just stay in a bathhouse?

48:29.907 --> 48:32.951
Nah, those places are dirty.

48:33.869 --> 48:36.121
Last time I went, I got athlete's foot.

48:51.094 --> 48:53.221
This room is incredible!
How much was this?

49:11.448 --> 49:13.700
What are you doing?
Let's get the party started!

49:15.118 --> 49:16.453
Just a sec!

49:20.666 --> 49:22.626
-Oh, shit.
-What are you doing?

49:25.087 --> 49:25.963
Here.

49:54.116 --> 49:55.242
Come here.

49:55.742 --> 49:57.160
-Hey.
-Hey.

49:57.244 --> 49:58.662
Take a drink.

50:06.795 --> 50:07.796
Drink it.

50:18.473 --> 50:21.435
Hey, let me make you another.

50:22.269 --> 50:23.478
I can't drink too much.

50:23.562 --> 50:26.023
I gotta book dance jobs. Can't have a gut.

50:26.523 --> 50:29.943
Don't be a pussy. It's Diet Rite.

51:08.231 --> 51:09.107
Wake up!

51:10.942 --> 51:12.152
Wake up!

52:06.289 --> 52:07.624
Come on.

53:00.385 --> 53:01.219
Hey.

53:03.763 --> 53:04.598
Hey.

53:33.793 --> 53:34.711
Hey.

53:41.384 --> 53:42.802
Oh my God.

53:45.847 --> 53:47.265
Oh my God.

53:56.233 --> 53:57.359
Oh my God.

54:01.488 --> 54:04.032
No. No.

54:06.076 --> 54:07.118
Come on.

54:08.536 --> 54:09.537
No.

54:10.747 --> 54:11.915
Wake up.

54:17.837 --> 54:22.801
Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

54:36.022 --> 54:37.190
Fuck!

54:48.451 --> 54:49.452
Come on.

57:15.098 --> 57:16.891
You going to church tomorrow?

57:16.975 --> 57:19.060
You asked me that already, Jeff.

57:19.686 --> 57:22.105
Why? You want to come?

57:22.897 --> 57:24.190
No.

57:25.358 --> 57:28.528
Just want to know what the schedule is.

57:30.113 --> 57:33.032
Dad says I'm the man of the house.
I got a right to know.

57:33.116 --> 57:35.452
All right, all right, let's not argue.
