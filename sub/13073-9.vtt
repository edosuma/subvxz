- Oh, there you are.
- Ahh!

18:53.599 --> 18:54.867
Oh, hey, Piri Piri.

18:54.933 --> 18:56.268
I was just out.

18:56.335 --> 18:58.604
I mean, I-I wasn't--

18:58.670 --> 19:00.639
I've been looking
all over for you.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.941
Jackie Slitherstein
wanted to meet you.

19:03.008 --> 19:05.010
She wanted to meet me?

19:05.077 --> 19:07.112
Of course, darling.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.114
You're Harvey Beaks,
aren't you?

19:09.181 --> 19:11.950
Detective Dirk's
number one fan?

19:12.017 --> 19:14.987
Piri Piri told me
all about you.

19:15.053 --> 19:17.089
Jackie Slitherstein.

19:17.155 --> 19:20.259
Yes. It's a pleasure
for you to meet me.

19:21.994 --> 19:25.030
{\an3}Shame about those books though,
huh, Junior Sleuth?

19:25.097 --> 19:27.266
Oh, the books?

19:27.332 --> 19:30.802
Someone intercepted the delivery
of the new books.

19:30.869 --> 19:32.237
I'm sorry, Harvey.

19:32.304 --> 19:34.806
I guess no one's
going to read them now.

19:34.873 --> 19:36.308
Oh.

19:42.214 --> 19:44.950
{\an1}Guys, I know we're all
really bummed out,

19:45.017 --> 19:47.252
but maybe,
if we all work together,

19:47.319 --> 19:48.687
we can track down the books
by using

19:48.754 --> 19:51.023
our Detective Dirk
Junior Sleuth skills.

19:51.089 --> 19:52.024
What do you say?

19:52.090 --> 19:54.493
[all cheering]

19:54.560 --> 19:56.628
Looks like
we're on the case.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.630
Oi, I see a clue!

19:58.697 --> 19:59.798
[grunting]

19:59.865 --> 20:01.166
Look at these tracks.

20:01.233 --> 20:02.768
It looks like a box
was dragged from here.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.169
Well deduced, Rooter.

20:04.236 --> 20:05.837
{\an3}And from the looks
of it,

20:05.904 --> 20:07.573
it was dragged slowly.

20:07.639 --> 20:10.909
Maybe they were weighed down by
the awful guilt of their crime.

20:10.976 --> 20:12.277
Perhaps they were.

20:12.344 --> 20:14.880
And perhaps they still are.

20:14.947 --> 20:18.116
Whatever. Let's just follow
the stupid tracks already.

20:18.183 --> 20:20.252
[spy music]

20:20.319 --> 20:23.388
Hmm?
Guys, I think I found something.

20:23.455 --> 20:25.624
Looks like some blue feathers?

20:25.691 --> 20:27.159
[all gasp]

20:27.225 --> 20:30.596
Yeah, and they're, like,
really sweaty for some reason.

20:30.662 --> 20:31.763
Gross.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.166
{\an1}The culprit was probably
incredibly clammy

20:34.232 --> 20:35.167
because of his guilt.

20:35.233 --> 20:36.635
Look, everyone!

20:36.702 --> 20:38.770
The trail of feathers
and nervous sweat puddles

20:38.837 --> 20:39.805
lead right to that tree.

20:39.871 --> 20:44.009
[all murmuring]

20:44.076 --> 20:45.377
It's the books!

20:45.444 --> 20:48.213
Who could have done
such a terrible thing,

20:48.280 --> 20:50.015
putting them
in a tree like that?

20:50.082 --> 20:51.416
Isn't it obvious?

20:51.483 --> 20:53.752
The blue feather,
the nervous sweat.

20:53.819 --> 20:56.922
Can't you see?
I'm not on the case.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.256
I am the case.

20:58.323 --> 21:01.193
[all gasping]

21:01.259 --> 21:02.928
{\an3}Plot twist!

21:02.995 --> 21:05.063
But, Harvey, why?

21:05.130 --> 21:07.599
I wanted to like Dirk
the most.

21:07.666 --> 21:10.235
I guess the real mystery
I had to uncover was...

21:10.302 --> 21:13.905
[sighs]
The mystery of sharing.

21:13.972 --> 21:15.907
I'm really sorry, guys.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.043
[excited chatter]

21:18.110 --> 21:19.811
- My book, my book, my book!
- Yeah!

21:19.878 --> 21:20.879
{\an3}Ahem.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.015
[gasps]
Jackie Slitherstein.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.883
You needn't apologize.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.418
I've already forgiven you.

21:26.485 --> 21:28.353
I'm benevolent like that.

21:28.420 --> 21:31.056
{\an1}Okay. I don't know
what that word means.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.524
You know, if you'd like,

21:32.591 --> 21:35.827
I could tell you
about my upcoming series,

21:35.894 --> 21:37.362
<i>Futon Fernando.</i>

21:37.429 --> 21:40.699
{\an3}It could be
your special thing.

21:40.766 --> 21:41.867
{\an3}[chuckles]

21:44.136 --> 21:48.006
Thanks, but I think I'd rather
wait until we all can read it.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.075
Very well.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.443
Hey, Harvey.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.311
{\an1}Looks like there's
one last book in the box.

21:53.378 --> 21:55.147
Wanna share it?

21:55.213 --> 21:56.682
{\an3}Do I ever!
