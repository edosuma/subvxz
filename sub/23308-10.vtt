WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.343
I'm a librarian.

00:01.349 --> 00:04.122
Currently on the lam from
a billion year contract.

00:04.128 --> 00:06.747
- Sylvia, what'd you do?
- I'm sorry.

00:07.928 --> 00:09.561
- Just let me see it again.
- No.

00:09.596 --> 00:11.997
Not till you tell me what you
were doing in the Library.

00:12.032 --> 00:15.233
I'm stuck in the Fairy Realm.
How can I see you?

00:15.268 --> 00:17.569
Let's you see into other
worlds, it's rad.

00:17.604 --> 00:19.270
You're the absolute worst rulers

00:19.306 --> 00:21.072
Fillory has ever had.

00:21.107 --> 00:22.907
Honey, you don't have to listen to Tick.

00:22.942 --> 00:24.307
You can just do your own thing.

00:24.313 --> 00:27.445
Turn around, head home, relax, whatevs.

00:30.149 --> 00:33.250
It's the excretion of a
very rare magical creature.

00:33.612 --> 00:34.786
This magic.

00:34.792 --> 00:37.154
I mean, it looks different.
It feels different.

00:37.190 --> 00:38.522
Oh, God, they cut off her leg.

00:38.557 --> 00:41.158
You clean their homes.
You cook their food.

00:41.194 --> 00:43.327
And they take your leg
and grind it into powder

00:43.362 --> 00:45.162
to snort so they can do magic tricks.

00:45.198 --> 00:47.231
I wanna help you get out of here.

00:48.534 --> 00:50.066
The necklace.

00:50.102 --> 00:52.569
It kills them when they use magic.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.421
So you're just okay with letting Kady

00:57.427 --> 00:59.836
- take the Fifth Key, huh?
- I'm not letting her do anything.

00:59.842 --> 01:02.294
But when I ask you about
the book, you freak out.

01:02.300 --> 01:03.700
Hey, Kady, I...

01:03.706 --> 01:05.938
Please leave a message at the tone.

01:07.017 --> 01:10.084
Hey, uh, it's Quentin.
Call me back, please.

01:11.060 --> 01:12.859
Look, she probably took it because...

01:12.865 --> 01:15.933
Because you trust a heroin
addict more than you trust me.

01:16.225 --> 01:18.425
At least I know what Kady wants.

01:18.460 --> 01:20.093
What does that mean?

01:20.129 --> 01:22.362
She wants to talk to Penny.

01:22.397 --> 01:23.948
But you, I don't...

01:23.954 --> 01:25.965
First, you don't wanna
help us with the Quest.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.968
Then, suddenly, you want magic so badly

01:29.003 --> 01:31.698
- that you nearly kill yourself.
- That's not fair.

01:31.764 --> 01:33.831
None of that is fair.

01:34.242 --> 01:36.309
Okay, well, then what is it?

01:36.345 --> 01:37.644
Do you...

01:37.679 --> 01:40.734
Are you with us? Do you want magic back?

01:41.349 --> 01:43.218
Of course I want magic.

01:45.353 --> 01:47.119
Okay, well, then what changed?

01:47.155 --> 01:48.787
Why now?

01:48.823 --> 01:50.622
As opposed to when, huh?

01:50.658 --> 01:52.950
When you asked me if I
wanted to go on a Quest

01:52.956 --> 01:55.422
five minutes after my dad died?

01:55.663 --> 01:59.130
Would you be ready to go
on a fucking adventure?

01:59.826 --> 02:01.576
- Alice, I'm just...
- You know, and are you

02:01.582 --> 02:03.039
the only one who's allowed to be

02:03.070 --> 02:05.136
ambivalent and depressive and...

02:05.172 --> 02:06.986
And scared and hate themselves?

02:07.111 --> 02:10.308
But I just have to be
sure of everything, huh?

02:10.344 --> 02:12.004
Fuck you, Quentin.

02:14.348 --> 02:17.148
Uh, s... sorry.

02:17.184 --> 02:19.184
I was just trying to get through.

02:19.219 --> 02:20.316
Sorry.

02:22.389 --> 02:24.089
We can fight about this after the Quest.

02:24.124 --> 02:26.477
Just let me see the stupid book.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.054 --> 02:41.450
Whoa.

02:43.974 --> 02:45.573
There's something she's not telling me.

02:45.711 --> 02:47.505
You really think it was a good idea

02:47.511 --> 02:49.184
to give her the book?

02:49.215 --> 02:50.680
I don't know.

02:50.716 --> 02:52.549
She helped us with the last key.

02:52.584 --> 02:53.904
And we're probably gonna need

02:53.910 --> 02:55.710
her for the next one, so...

02:59.158 --> 03:02.392
The book says that the Sixth Key is

03:02.428 --> 03:04.360
in the Throne Room at Whitespire.

03:04.396 --> 03:05.808
Oh, shit.

03:05.814 --> 03:07.597
Wait, that's where Margo and Eliot...

03:07.633 --> 03:11.027
Just got overthrown violently? Yeah.

03:13.505 --> 03:15.138
Oh.

03:15.144 --> 03:16.817
I need an aspirin.

03:26.603 --> 03:27.972
Whoa.

03:29.761 --> 03:30.958
Thank you.

03:32.590 --> 03:35.090
I'll never take magic for granted again.

03:35.125 --> 03:36.559
Yeah.

03:36.594 --> 03:38.302
Me neither.

03:39.764 --> 03:41.564
Uh, look,

03:41.599 --> 03:42.957
there's something I have to

03:42.963 --> 03:44.961
finish here before I can leave.

03:45.150 --> 03:47.135
I can't go knowing
that the fairies are...

03:47.171 --> 03:50.439
Jules, do what you gotta do.

03:50.475 --> 03:53.442
- Just be careful, okay?
- Yeah.

03:53.625 --> 03:54.834
You too.

03:55.718 --> 03:56.929
Okay, so Skye's telling

03:56.935 --> 03:58.185
the others what happened to her.

03:58.215 --> 03:59.747
And that we wanna help them escape.

03:59.783 --> 04:01.053
But that can't happen until

04:01.059 --> 04:02.422
we get their necklaces off.

04:02.453 --> 04:03.585
Oh.

04:03.620 --> 04:06.188
There's an emoji of a dagger.

04:06.223 --> 04:09.491
Todd was right, this truly
is the universal language.

04:09.526 --> 04:10.792
I need you to focus.

04:10.827 --> 04:12.760
I can't find anything
on these necklaces,

04:12.796 --> 04:14.328
and I need to know how they work.

04:14.364 --> 04:16.430
Can't you see I'm busy?

04:16.466 --> 04:17.932
Fen.

04:17.968 --> 04:19.625
Look, I know what the fairies did

04:19.632 --> 04:21.339
to you in Fillory was fucked up.

04:21.370 --> 04:23.270
And I'm sorry about that, but...

04:23.306 --> 04:24.671
Yeah...

04:24.707 --> 04:26.986
That's my response.

04:30.579 --> 04:33.822
Is that a gif of a crab with a knife?

04:34.096 --> 04:35.282
It's how I feel.

04:35.318 --> 04:38.386
Is it "gif" or "jif?"

04:38.421 --> 04:41.522
Please. I need your help.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.942
Fairies just make my skin crawl.

04:48.097 --> 04:50.520
Okay, and how does
slavery make you feel?

04:51.852 --> 04:53.700
So what you're saying is that

04:53.706 --> 04:55.574
you want a fairy necklace

04:55.604 --> 04:57.570
- to examine?
- Yes.

04:57.605 --> 05:01.307
One that isn't already
attached to a fairy's neck.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.643
Fine, but don't expect me to pretend

05:03.678 --> 05:05.928
like I don't hate fairies.

05:05.934 --> 05:08.334
You don't have to.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.736
We know about your fairies.

05:11.134 --> 05:12.752
There's one standing right there.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.425
Fen's family had a problem with them,

05:19.460 --> 05:21.193
so I'm trying to help fix it.

05:21.228 --> 05:23.328
I hate them. Their black eyes.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.998
Their long fingers. Their mushrooms.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.366
Mushrooms?

05:27.401 --> 05:28.834
They make the air thick and musty,

05:28.870 --> 05:31.670
like a bear's undercarriage.

05:31.705 --> 05:33.052
And what was the deal that

05:33.058 --> 05:34.611
you made with these fairies?

05:34.641 --> 05:36.189
Oh, I didn't make a deal.

05:36.195 --> 05:38.241
- One was made for me by...
- By her family.

05:38.247 --> 05:40.279
See, uh, they were tricked.

05:40.314 --> 05:42.214
Interesting.

05:42.249 --> 05:44.683
And here I thought that the
fairies under my protection

05:44.718 --> 05:46.218
were the last of their kind.

05:46.253 --> 05:47.619
I wish.

05:47.654 --> 05:49.287
- They're everywhere in Fil...
- Fillmore.

05:49.322 --> 05:50.722
Fillmore.

05:50.757 --> 05:54.358
It's, um... it's a small
farming town in the Midwest.

05:54.394 --> 05:55.627
And what about you, Julia?

05:55.662 --> 05:57.028
How is it that you can see them?

05:57.064 --> 05:58.567
I made a deal with a younger fairy.

05:58.573 --> 06:00.544
Visibility for a Snickers bar.

06:01.635 --> 06:03.568
And just how young was this fairy?

06:03.603 --> 06:06.537
I don't know, actually.
Still trying to catch one.

06:06.573 --> 06:08.968
Which... which is why
we wanted to ask you,

06:10.076 --> 06:12.333
how are the ones here,

06:12.472 --> 06:15.056
you know, so docile?

06:15.281 --> 06:17.548
Well, I assume that
you've noticed that, uh,

06:17.584 --> 06:20.550
all of my fairies have
this silver collar.

06:20.586 --> 06:22.720
You mean, their necklace?

06:22.755 --> 06:24.321
Necklaces, yeah.

06:24.356 --> 06:26.556
They are cute, aren't they?

06:26.592 --> 06:29.998
They're to help keep things
from getting out of control.

06:30.188 --> 06:31.454
You'll need one.

06:31.506 --> 06:34.306
You can get it from my Uncle Edwin.

06:34.466 --> 06:36.799
But I'm gonna need something in return.

06:36.835 --> 06:38.768
Of course. If your rash is back...

06:38.803 --> 06:41.437
I'll need you to bring me a fairy.

06:49.615 --> 06:53.576

07:11.802 --> 07:14.603
Penny, during orientation,

07:14.639 --> 07:17.105
weren't you trained on how
to properly re-shelve?

07:17.141 --> 07:18.874
We got a billion years, Howard.

07:18.909 --> 07:20.942
Just keeping shit interesting.

07:20.978 --> 07:23.011
So, uh, Penny.

07:25.550 --> 07:28.316
My book club is looking for new members.

07:28.351 --> 07:31.820
Interesting people.
And I thought of you.

07:31.855 --> 07:33.060
Why?

07:33.388 --> 07:34.995
'Cause I'm brown?

07:36.161 --> 07:37.959
And shackled?

07:37.995 --> 07:39.795
You know this looks bad
for the Library, right?

07:39.830 --> 07:42.330
Oh, no. We are not...

07:42.365 --> 07:45.533
We shackle people of all
races and colors here.

07:45.569 --> 07:47.368
Not better, Howard.

07:47.404 --> 07:49.136
What I meant was...

07:49.172 --> 07:50.905
- I read your book.
- The hell?

07:50.940 --> 07:53.234
I had unresolved feelings about my death

07:53.240 --> 07:54.576
and your hand in it.

07:54.611 --> 07:56.877
You killed yourself.

07:56.913 --> 07:58.846
Am I misremembering the
part where you handed me

07:58.881 --> 08:01.549
the cursed book that
directly led to that?

08:03.019 --> 08:06.486
So the least you can do
is join my book club.

08:06.522 --> 08:08.008
Kathy always brings cupcakes.

08:08.014 --> 08:10.673
- They're amazing.
- Fuck off, Howard.

08:11.431 --> 08:14.494
Participation helps ease
the transition, Penny.

08:14.530 --> 08:16.197
Give it a think.

08:20.202 --> 08:22.502
Fasten it around the
neck to activate it.

08:22.538 --> 08:25.739
Then it will instantly kill
a fairy if they use magic.

08:25.774 --> 08:28.575
Should deter them from even trying.

08:28.611 --> 08:31.284
Of course, you have to
actually catch a fairy first.

08:31.290 --> 08:33.519
Oh, I'm sure I'll figure something out.

08:33.782 --> 08:35.914
So, how does it work?

08:35.951 --> 08:38.437
I mean, what's it powered by?
Considering there's...

08:38.443 --> 08:40.176
That would be a family secret.

08:40.648 --> 08:42.945
Okay. Uh, but...

08:43.725 --> 08:46.793
once it's on, how will
I know it's secure?

08:46.828 --> 08:48.527
Has a fairy ever broken out of one?

08:48.563 --> 08:50.965
Dust.

08:52.634 --> 08:54.867
This is Dust.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.035
I've had him since I was 16.

08:57.071 --> 08:59.472
But he's been in the family much longer.

08:59.507 --> 09:00.910
How long?

09:01.334 --> 09:03.167
Over 400 years, sir.

09:03.279 --> 09:04.902
He may not look it,

09:04.908 --> 09:07.042
but he's our oldest Fairy.

09:07.048 --> 09:10.516
Tell Irene her guest has a collar.

09:11.085 --> 09:12.854
Yes, sir.

09:15.622 --> 09:17.890
There's really only one
way to take them off.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.457
I have a machine that does it.

09:19.493 --> 09:21.926
So don't worry, they're secure.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.731
Great.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.233
Thank you so much for all your help.

09:35.609 --> 09:38.085
- Today is not my day.
- I get that you're mad, okay?

09:38.091 --> 09:40.867
- But just hear me out.
- You turned me in, Sylvia.

09:41.530 --> 09:43.447
Look, when magic went out,

09:43.482 --> 09:45.378
shit got really bad up
there for my family, okay?

09:45.384 --> 09:48.752
My... my brothers, my...
my uncles, my dad,

09:48.788 --> 09:51.083
- they all got whacked.
- And went where?

09:51.225 --> 09:54.192
To the Underworld? Where you are?

09:54.337 --> 09:56.637
All my people are up there, Sylvia.

09:56.962 --> 09:59.029
I can't travel, I can't astral project,

09:59.064 --> 10:01.251
I can't do shit 'cause of you.

10:01.257 --> 10:04.266
My family isn't in the
Underworld, Penny.

10:05.332 --> 10:06.922
They moved on.

10:07.769 --> 10:09.165
To where?

10:11.176 --> 10:12.943
I mean, I'm not sure.

10:12.978 --> 10:14.945
The Underworld is just
a way station, really.

10:14.980 --> 10:17.547
You hang around for a bit, and then

10:17.582 --> 10:20.016
the bureaucracies that be move you on.

10:20.052 --> 10:23.078
But I don't know what or where that is.

10:23.989 --> 10:26.056
So your family just left you?

10:26.091 --> 10:28.825
Yeah, Dad's always sucked at waiting,

10:28.860 --> 10:31.494
so he pulled some strings
and cut the line.

10:31.529 --> 10:34.129
But these contracts that
we sign with the Library

10:34.165 --> 10:36.026
are fucking ironclad,

10:36.112 --> 10:37.505
so I can't go anywhere

10:37.535 --> 10:39.635
until I finish my billion years.

10:39.671 --> 10:42.137
When the Library put a bounty on you,

10:42.173 --> 10:43.823
it brought me a million years

10:43.829 --> 10:45.696
closer to my family, Penny.

10:46.636 --> 10:49.011
And I'm sorry. I know that
that doesn't fix anything...

10:49.046 --> 10:50.688
Yeah, you're right.

10:50.978 --> 10:52.969
It fixes shit.

10:57.788 --> 10:59.989
I spoke to a few of the others.

11:00.024 --> 11:02.524
They don't believe me.

11:02.559 --> 11:04.893
If I hadn't done the magic,

11:04.928 --> 11:07.992
if I hadn't felt what happened,

11:08.732 --> 11:10.732
I don't think I would believe me either.

11:10.768 --> 11:12.333
Okay, Skye.

11:12.369 --> 11:13.760
You've got to keep trying.

11:13.766 --> 11:16.900
How? What should I say?

11:16.994 --> 11:18.794
Look, I don't know,

11:18.800 --> 11:21.433
but I found a way to
take off the collars.

11:21.491 --> 11:23.240
Edwin's got a machine in the Lab.

11:23.246 --> 11:26.747
It won't matter. They're scared.

11:26.783 --> 11:30.018
The thought of escape
is like a death wish.

11:30.053 --> 11:31.471
But...

11:31.477 --> 11:33.644
There is one more thing.

11:33.650 --> 11:37.418
Several of Ms. Irene's
family have arrived.

11:37.516 --> 11:39.280
Many of them brought their fairies.

11:39.286 --> 11:41.004
To Brakebills?

11:41.364 --> 11:42.696
Why?

11:42.732 --> 11:43.898
I don't know.

11:43.933 --> 11:45.065
Skye.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.366
I'm sorry.

11:46.402 --> 11:48.369
It's okay.

11:51.304 --> 11:52.862
If Skye can't convince them

11:52.868 --> 11:54.382
to run, what are we gonna do?

11:54.609 --> 11:57.911
We introduce them to someone scarier.

12:00.682 --> 12:03.616
I'm on a flying boat!

12:03.652 --> 12:07.887
Okay, so the Sixth Key
is in the Throne Room?

12:07.923 --> 12:09.889
Where Tick's waiting
with a serrated spoon

12:09.925 --> 12:11.724
to just saw off our heads?

12:11.760 --> 12:13.159
Tick isn't at Whitespire, though.

12:13.194 --> 12:14.961
He's up north, near Loria.

12:14.996 --> 12:17.630
The Throne Room is empty,
but we need to move fast.

12:17.666 --> 12:19.265
So the book says that the Sixth Key

12:19.300 --> 12:21.901
will only reveal itself in
the light of two half moons,

12:21.937 --> 12:23.602
which is a thing that
happens in Fillory.

12:23.637 --> 12:27.239
Like two black and white
cookies split apart

12:27.275 --> 12:30.783
to form one giant white cookie.

12:31.205 --> 12:33.145
A cookie moon.

12:33.181 --> 12:34.658
Mm-hmm.

12:35.276 --> 12:36.682
Uh, anyway,

12:36.717 --> 12:39.520
so it... it's gonna be super bright,

12:39.526 --> 12:40.986
um, and it happens tonight, so...

12:41.021 --> 12:43.288
Wait, why is Tick up near Loria?

12:43.323 --> 12:44.923
- Fillory's at war.
- What?

12:44.959 --> 12:46.124
The fuck?

12:46.159 --> 12:47.826
I know, we are literally Questing

12:47.862 --> 12:49.695
through a war-torn country.

12:49.730 --> 12:51.029
So epic.

12:51.064 --> 12:53.098
And who exactly are we at war with?

12:53.133 --> 12:55.033
The Lorians and the Floaters.

12:55.068 --> 12:57.100
Yeah, we heard about it when
we were passing through town.

12:57.106 --> 12:59.133
That cock's High King for three seconds

12:59.139 --> 13:01.939
- and it all goes to shit.
- I need to send a Bunny to Idri.

13:01.975 --> 13:03.941
Yeah, I'll send one to that Stone bitch.

13:03.977 --> 13:05.591
Wait, what about the key?

13:05.597 --> 13:07.212
Q, you just told us,

13:07.247 --> 13:10.215
Fillory is being spit-roasted
by invading forces.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.682
Without us.

13:11.718 --> 13:13.450
Okay, can I say something obvious,

13:13.486 --> 13:16.320
yet potentially controversial?

13:16.355 --> 13:18.890
We are no longer the Kings
and Queens of Fillory.

13:18.925 --> 13:20.124
Says who?

13:20.159 --> 13:22.226
Fillory, when they overthrew you.

13:22.261 --> 13:25.195
- Mm...
- Well, they were misguided,

13:25.231 --> 13:27.297
and scared, and they needed scapegoats.

13:27.333 --> 13:28.842
At some point, you either have

13:28.848 --> 13:30.305
to choose to follow through

13:30.336 --> 13:32.336
on something, or just,

13:32.371 --> 13:33.821
well,

13:34.173 --> 13:35.329
die.

13:35.532 --> 13:38.675
Look, we chose this.

13:38.710 --> 13:40.977
You captain the Key Quest, Coldwater,

13:41.013 --> 13:42.879
and we'll stop war.

13:42.915 --> 13:45.849
Ooh, ooh, can you drop
us off at Whitespire

13:45.855 --> 13:46.998
after it gets dark?

13:47.033 --> 13:48.380
They have that balcony.

13:48.386 --> 13:51.154
We could just rappel down
into the Throne Room.

13:51.189 --> 13:53.089
It would be dope.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.158
Get ready to tuck and roll, bitches,

13:55.193 --> 13:58.455
'cause this boat don't
do complete stops.

14:02.434 --> 14:04.990
Yes, once fairies lived on Earth.

14:04.996 --> 14:07.396
But not in hundreds of years.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.352
Not since we fled to Fillory

14:09.358 --> 14:10.658
because human Magicians

14:10.664 --> 14:13.632
nearly hunted us into extinction.

14:14.006 --> 14:15.205
I had no idea.

14:15.241 --> 14:17.141
Of course not.

14:17.176 --> 14:20.344
Short memory is a privilege
of the oppressor.

14:21.914 --> 14:23.147
I'm sorry.

14:23.182 --> 14:25.482
So you'll understand my disbelief then

14:25.517 --> 14:28.385
when a human tries to lure me to Earth

14:28.420 --> 14:31.953
with tales of a lost
tribe that can't exist.

14:31.959 --> 14:33.657
- But they're not...
- I've heard enough.

14:33.692 --> 14:35.008
Wait.

14:36.162 --> 14:37.995
You're not listening.

14:38.030 --> 14:40.229
I'd rather remove your tongue.

14:40.265 --> 14:42.332
Maybe your teeth.

14:42.367 --> 14:44.867
- You choose.
- Go ahead.

14:44.903 --> 14:48.171
You have already taken so much from me.

14:48.206 --> 14:49.872
What's a few teeth?

14:52.711 --> 14:55.411
You've got two sentences.

14:55.446 --> 14:57.374
Choose wisely.

14:58.416 --> 15:01.517
I hate fairies.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.638
So why would I come here,

15:03.644 --> 15:06.194
to a place where you stole my toes

15:06.224 --> 15:09.735
and I lost my child, if it wasn't true?

15:11.029 --> 15:13.195
Then why would you do this for me?

15:13.230 --> 15:15.364
It's not for you.

15:15.399 --> 15:17.167
- It's for them.
- They're still fairies.

15:17.173 --> 15:18.900
But they're nothing like you.

15:18.936 --> 15:21.337
They're more like traumatized children.

15:21.372 --> 15:24.172
And as a mother, despite
what you did to me,

15:24.208 --> 15:26.193
they deserve a chance to live.

15:26.484 --> 15:28.451
So get off your...

15:28.946 --> 15:32.147
Whatever it is fairies
have for rear butts,

15:32.316 --> 15:34.082
and do something.

15:34.117 --> 15:36.332
They need their Queen.

15:57.886 --> 16:00.074
What part of the Library

16:00.109 --> 16:02.254
is "Secrets Taken to the Grave"?

16:02.845 --> 16:05.078
Oh, so now you're talking to me?

16:05.348 --> 16:07.447
I'm... I'm kidding. Chill.

16:07.483 --> 16:10.001
Uh, it's some weird

16:10.186 --> 16:12.266
research division

16:12.272 --> 16:14.621
that the Library made in
partnership with the people

16:14.656 --> 16:16.748
who run the Underworld.

16:16.899 --> 16:19.866
Librarians like us aren't
even allowed to go in there.

16:23.331 --> 16:25.399
What the hell do they
do to these people?

16:25.434 --> 16:26.966
Oh, it's like primal therapy

16:26.972 --> 16:28.502
for people who are about to move on.

16:28.537 --> 16:30.303
You go and unload your bullshit

16:30.338 --> 16:31.605
and it lightens your conscience.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.306
I'm sure my dad's was a nightmare.

16:33.341 --> 16:34.473
This is all part of that

16:34.509 --> 16:36.142
"Underworld is a way station" shit?

16:36.177 --> 16:37.977
Yeah, they, like, jot
down everything of note,

16:37.983 --> 16:40.149
and then at the end you get
a metro card out of here.

16:40.155 --> 16:43.056
You're telling me there's a
subway out of the Underworld?

16:43.062 --> 16:46.363
Well, it's more like this giant, long,

16:46.487 --> 16:49.289
pig-type creature that
you, like, climb into,

16:49.324 --> 16:51.290
and then it takes you
wherever you need to go next.

16:51.325 --> 16:53.125
Why the hell are we still here?

16:53.160 --> 16:54.548
Why haven't we hijacked that long pig?

16:54.554 --> 16:56.559
Because it only shows
up when somebody has

16:56.565 --> 16:58.335
a metro card and is ready to move on.

17:00.134 --> 17:03.135
Our contracts will never let us move on.

17:03.170 --> 17:06.449
Nobody's ever gonna give
us metro cards, Penny.

17:08.175 --> 17:10.642
Not like them.

17:14.714 --> 17:17.281
Okay, so in this chapter

17:17.318 --> 17:20.285
the Daughter, she finally
becomes the Knight

17:20.320 --> 17:23.288
that she set out to be, and
right after she's knighted,

17:23.324 --> 17:27.391
her shield catches a moonbeam
and it reflects it back.

17:28.728 --> 17:30.495
- What're you doing?
- Guys, guys.

17:30.530 --> 17:34.198
Reminder, there are still
guards patrolling around, so...

17:34.233 --> 17:36.049
The book says the moonlight has to hit

17:36.055 --> 17:37.838
three keystones to reveal the key.

17:37.844 --> 17:39.571
There's three doors, three keystones,

17:39.606 --> 17:41.505
and none of them are near a window.

17:41.540 --> 17:43.474
Okay, so we set up some mirrors,

17:43.509 --> 17:45.176
and bounce around some moonlight,

17:45.211 --> 17:47.411
and then we're back on track?
Enjoying the Quest?

17:47.447 --> 17:49.868
- Yeah, if that's what the book says.
- Ou know it does.

17:49.874 --> 17:51.841
Hey.

17:51.847 --> 17:54.185
Look, it's a perfect metaphor
for your relationship.

17:56.456 --> 17:57.988
Not ready to laugh...

17:58.591 --> 18:00.256
Yet, that's fine.

18:00.292 --> 18:02.777
You want me to put on a slave collar?

18:02.783 --> 18:04.259
It's the only way we can get you

18:04.265 --> 18:05.850
in direct contact with Irene's fairies.

18:05.856 --> 18:08.256
Or I could just cut off all
the McAllistairs' heads.

18:08.262 --> 18:09.867
For all we know, the McAllistairs

18:09.902 --> 18:11.702
can trigger the collars remotely.

18:11.737 --> 18:13.236
And just like that......

18:13.242 --> 18:15.442
Every collared fairy will be dead.

18:15.540 --> 18:18.074
We need to be stealth. Smart.

18:18.110 --> 18:19.485
Tell me,

18:19.491 --> 18:23.141
what's smart about rendering
myself defenseless

18:23.147 --> 18:25.237
and then entrusting my life

18:25.243 --> 18:27.254
to a powerless Magician?

18:46.472 --> 18:48.633
You're god-touched.

18:49.940 --> 18:52.047
That's one way to put it.

18:52.282 --> 18:54.115
But it also means I can protect you.

18:54.150 --> 18:56.284
It doesn't mean that I trust you.

18:56.319 --> 18:58.319
I get it. For good reason.

18:58.354 --> 19:00.587
Why would you trust any human on Earth?

19:00.623 --> 19:03.490
But Fen and I are risking our lives.

19:03.526 --> 19:05.158
So we need you to trust us.

19:05.193 --> 19:06.729
Or don't.

19:07.296 --> 19:09.195
And we can just do this on our own.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.997
Without you.

19:11.033 --> 19:12.341
She's right.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.669
I'm not sure how, but
we will find a way.

19:15.704 --> 19:18.439
What is it that you want from us?

19:18.474 --> 19:20.340
Not sure I understand.

19:20.375 --> 19:23.333
She's healing a mother's
wound, but you...

19:23.545 --> 19:25.913
Why go so far, Julia?

19:28.025 --> 19:31.460
Let's just say being
god-touched is a mixed bag.

19:31.686 --> 19:34.321
But I choose to do something with that.

19:34.356 --> 19:36.288
It means something.

19:36.324 --> 19:37.932
Helping those fairies,

19:37.938 --> 19:40.526
saving them, with you.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.163
And this collar.

19:52.173 --> 19:55.040
This had better work.

19:58.583 --> 20:00.550
She really is stunning.

20:00.586 --> 20:02.486
How many more of them are there?

20:02.521 --> 20:03.954
Hard to say, really.

20:03.989 --> 20:05.708
They're not all that friendly.

20:05.897 --> 20:08.264
And where did you say your
friend is from again?

20:08.659 --> 20:11.456
- The Midwest.
- No, I mean what town is she...

20:15.867 --> 20:17.914
Huh, excuse me.

20:23.340 --> 20:25.474
Fairly well-behaved, actually,

20:25.510 --> 20:27.309
considering she's feral.

20:27.344 --> 20:29.244
Guess I got lucky, huh?

20:29.279 --> 20:31.244
Uh, that's a much faster

20:31.250 --> 20:33.787
turnaround than we agreed on.

20:35.486 --> 20:37.009
You know what, it'll be a push,

20:37.015 --> 20:39.521
but I think I can get
it to you all by then.

20:39.556 --> 20:41.456
The others will take some convincing...

20:41.492 --> 20:42.968
Looks like we're working through dinner.

20:42.974 --> 20:44.919
You know what to do with her.

20:45.562 --> 20:48.753
 ... especially if time is against us.

20:49.255 --> 20:52.667
My apologies, I'm having
family over for dinner.

20:52.702 --> 20:54.468
But we'll talk later?

20:54.504 --> 20:56.337
About the other fairies?

20:56.372 --> 20:57.739
Of course.

20:59.816 --> 21:02.616
_

21:02.623 --> 21:05.258
- _
- Shit.

21:51.145 --> 21:53.212
It's true.

21:53.246 --> 21:54.884
What Julia said.

21:54.890 --> 21:56.219
You're real.

21:58.933 --> 22:00.813
You're a queen.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.969
She's a queen.

22:02.975 --> 22:05.409
Of the free fairies.

22:10.444 --> 22:12.578
Never bow your head.

22:12.614 --> 22:14.226
For anyone.

22:22.490 --> 22:25.924
Collar breaker, collar breaker,

22:25.959 --> 22:28.927
where are you?

22:40.974 --> 22:44.375
- Ready the chair.
- I need to check the equipment.

22:44.410 --> 22:46.878
Yes, sir.

23:04.342 --> 23:05.929
They're saying they want everything.

23:05.965 --> 23:07.464
Our entire supply.

23:07.499 --> 23:08.999
Look, I know that it sounds risky,

23:09.035 --> 23:11.468
but there is a limited
time to this offer.

23:11.503 --> 23:13.570
- If we don't...
- Risky? No.

23:13.605 --> 23:15.873
Reckless. Leave us.

23:16.547 --> 23:18.412
Though we've been separated

23:18.418 --> 23:20.749
by time and great distance,

23:20.780 --> 23:22.912
we are the same.

23:22.947 --> 23:26.683
We are spun from divine inspiration.

23:26.718 --> 23:28.418
Blessed.

23:28.453 --> 23:32.355
We are the living embodiment of magic.

23:32.391 --> 23:35.024
I may have secured a new source.

23:35.060 --> 23:36.859
Of fairies? How?

23:36.895 --> 23:38.828
Ask Edwin. He's seen her.

23:38.863 --> 23:42.595
So I've come to restore your strength.

23:43.068 --> 23:45.276
To help you understand

23:45.282 --> 23:48.383
the glory of who you are.

23:48.446 --> 23:51.781
Your suffering is my suffering.

23:52.043 --> 23:55.517
Your injustice, mine.

23:56.233 --> 23:58.333
- Where is Edwin?
- Edwin?

23:58.640 --> 24:00.345
Edwin is working.

24:07.057 --> 24:09.891
And when we are finally free,

24:09.927 --> 24:14.462
we are gonna hunt down
every last living slaver,

24:14.497 --> 24:16.531
gouge out their eyes,

24:16.566 --> 24:18.033
cut out their tongues,

24:18.068 --> 24:21.828
and hang them by their own entrails.

24:31.681 --> 24:34.515
You may feel a pinch, but if you relax,

24:34.551 --> 24:36.215
it'll be brief.

24:47.946 --> 24:50.381
You want us to pull back our
advancements on Fillory?

24:50.417 --> 24:51.790
This is ridiculous.

24:51.796 --> 24:54.652
All we're really asking is
that we pause the invasion.

24:54.687 --> 24:57.221
You both know that the
only reason Eliot and I are

24:57.256 --> 25:00.290
in this mess is because of
fairy meddling bullshit.

25:00.326 --> 25:02.740
And as soon as we clear this up
with the people of Fillory...

25:02.746 --> 25:05.166
Deposed rulers don't get
their thrones back.

25:05.172 --> 25:06.697
They exile themselves.

25:06.733 --> 25:08.398
Or die at the hands of the mob.

25:08.434 --> 25:10.501
Is this how you talk to all your allies?

25:10.536 --> 25:12.236
Allies?

25:12.271 --> 25:14.505
My dear, I have yet to see
any proof that your marriage

25:14.540 --> 25:16.306
to my son was ever even consummated.

25:16.342 --> 25:19.088
I made his little life
flash before his eyes.

25:19.094 --> 25:21.228
Are you sure that wasn't
from the toad bite?

25:23.049 --> 25:24.581
You saw it?

25:24.617 --> 25:26.517
Of course I did. I'm his mother.

25:26.552 --> 25:30.053
Wow, that's a lot to process.

25:30.555 --> 25:33.023
In any case, I have no
faith in either of you

25:33.058 --> 25:34.691
reclaiming your thrones.

25:34.726 --> 25:36.893
We will continue our
advancement on Fillory.

25:36.928 --> 25:38.895
I'm afraid Loria declines as well.

25:38.930 --> 25:41.865
With magic gone, Loria has
the advantage over Fillory.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.766
It makes no sense to withdraw

25:43.772 --> 25:45.573
when I know we'll succeed.

25:45.603 --> 25:47.882
I have to do what's best for my people.

25:49.288 --> 25:50.873
And what about our engagement?

25:50.908 --> 25:53.196
You're no longer king, Eliot.

25:53.202 --> 25:55.202
So it's no longer valid.

25:55.494 --> 25:57.086
King Idri,

25:57.484 --> 26:00.054
are you saying you have
yet to take a husband?

26:00.818 --> 26:03.686
My son's marble has yet to be polished.

26:03.721 --> 26:06.137
You mossy, pimping bitch.

26:06.143 --> 26:08.569
Will you excuse us for two seconds?

26:09.293 --> 26:10.944
As much as I would love

26:10.950 --> 26:12.599
to roll your smother-in-law

26:12.629 --> 26:14.303
off our boat, it won't prevent either

26:14.309 --> 26:15.668
one of them from invading Fillory.

26:15.674 --> 26:18.134
We need to split those
two up before your

26:18.140 --> 26:20.481
man's arranged to marry my child bride.

26:20.804 --> 26:22.937
And our best plan is...

26:25.676 --> 26:28.710
We offer them magic.

26:35.124 --> 26:36.283
What the...

26:39.355 --> 26:40.722
Fen!

26:40.757 --> 26:42.489
I just watched him help kill a fairy.

26:42.525 --> 26:45.326
And there isn't a machine
that removes their collars,

26:45.361 --> 26:47.234
just a machine that removes their heads.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.617
What?

26:49.498 --> 26:51.632
All right, we just need
to figure something out.

26:51.667 --> 26:53.667
There's nothing.

26:53.703 --> 26:55.603
Fairy deals cannot be broken.

26:55.638 --> 26:59.503
Wait, the magic that
controls the collars,

26:59.975 --> 27:02.042
they're fairy deals?

27:03.624 --> 27:06.625
Edwin said you're the
oldest of the fairies.

27:06.849 --> 27:09.449
Does that mean that you were
the one who made the deal?

27:09.484 --> 27:11.351
Yes.

27:11.386 --> 27:12.836
How could you do that

27:12.842 --> 27:15.460
to your own people?

27:16.658 --> 27:19.425
Hundreds of years ago,
Magicians had hunted us

27:19.461 --> 27:21.461
out of existence nearly.

27:21.496 --> 27:23.963
Then my Queen found
passage to a new world.

27:23.998 --> 27:25.818
Several of us volunteered

27:25.824 --> 27:27.838
to bind ourselves to the collars

27:27.869 --> 27:29.535
and the McAllistairs.

27:29.571 --> 27:32.646
A deal that would keep
them from following.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.834
We thought we'd sacrifice
the few for the many.

27:36.478 --> 27:38.978
But as my generation died,

27:39.013 --> 27:43.382
and younger generations
were born into this life,

27:43.417 --> 27:46.152
I lost faith in that sacrifice.

27:46.187 --> 27:49.237
Or in the belief that my Queen

27:49.243 --> 27:51.862
had made it to the other side.

27:51.893 --> 27:53.473
She did.

27:54.862 --> 27:57.028
My mother, your Queen,

27:57.063 --> 28:00.218
led us to Fillory, where I was born.

28:00.646 --> 28:03.513
And we were able to create a home there.

28:03.548 --> 28:06.121
All because of your sacrifice.

28:10.366 --> 28:12.844
You never should have come.

28:14.414 --> 28:17.147
Because now you can never go back.

28:22.054 --> 28:25.189
There is a way to break a
fairy deal, isn't there?

28:25.224 --> 28:28.658
- It doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter?

28:28.694 --> 28:30.027
Of course it does.

28:30.062 --> 28:32.235
I will not do it.

28:32.241 --> 28:35.767
Our deals are the
foundation of our culture

28:36.101 --> 28:38.735
and key to our survival.

28:38.770 --> 28:41.143
You are their Queen.

28:42.073 --> 28:43.992
You came here to save them.

28:43.998 --> 28:46.414
If you don't, what's the point?

28:46.445 --> 28:50.547
Fairies are known for
honoring their deals.

28:50.582 --> 28:52.139
When we break them,

28:52.145 --> 28:54.521
we lose the people's trust

28:54.552 --> 28:56.332
and our limited leverage,

28:56.338 --> 28:58.773
which we need for survival.

28:59.123 --> 29:03.425
Without that, we are
weak and vulnerable.

29:03.806 --> 29:05.694
It would be better for all of us

29:05.730 --> 29:07.563
for me to take it to the grave.

29:07.598 --> 29:09.098
Which will be soon enough!

29:09.133 --> 29:10.766
Against the wall.

29:11.402 --> 29:13.535
Dust, we're on a schedule.

29:23.614 --> 29:25.647
Do not go with him.

29:25.683 --> 29:27.582
What did I just say?

29:27.617 --> 29:29.550
I won't let you do this.

29:31.788 --> 29:35.014
I do not have time for this.

29:39.997 --> 29:42.897
Stop! No!

30:02.018 --> 30:04.584
What the fuck?

30:20.969 --> 30:22.936
Ah!

30:27.008 --> 30:29.108
You guarantee that this
is the best decision

30:29.144 --> 30:30.844
- for our family?
- I guarantee it.

30:30.879 --> 30:33.980
Do not make me regret
my decision, Irene.

30:34.015 --> 30:35.525
Oh, Vincent, when have I ever

30:35.531 --> 30:36.988
steered this family wrong?

30:37.018 --> 30:39.052
Cheers.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.786
- To us. To a new future.
- Cheers.

30:40.822 --> 30:43.346
Oh.

30:49.564 --> 30:51.697
Ahh!

31:31.009 --> 31:32.875
Shit.

31:32.910 --> 31:34.817
It seems like those Secrets

31:34.823 --> 31:37.083
dicks really made you earn it.

31:37.114 --> 31:38.964
Any idea where you're going

31:38.970 --> 31:40.888
now that you're moving on?

31:40.918 --> 31:43.084
No, they, uh... They didn't really say.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.020
Well, who'd you talk to?

31:45.055 --> 31:47.022
Was it Fran? Oh, she's...

31:47.057 --> 31:49.391
She's the one that just got
those two lazy eyes and...

31:49.426 --> 31:51.192
Never really know which one to focus on

31:51.228 --> 31:53.028
'cause they're both moving.

31:53.063 --> 31:54.396
I... I had, uh...

31:54.431 --> 31:56.364
I couldn't really see his
face under his hood,

31:56.400 --> 32:00.031
but he had... He had glowing red eyes.

32:00.904 --> 32:03.738
- Oh.
- What... what does that mean?

32:03.773 --> 32:06.286
Oh, you must have done some

32:06.292 --> 32:09.425
horrible shit in your time.

32:10.153 --> 32:12.320
Wait, wait, uh, whe... where am I going?

32:12.326 --> 32:14.114
Is it hell?

32:16.452 --> 32:18.245
If only.

32:19.255 --> 32:22.410
At least hell is warm.

32:23.092 --> 32:24.758
There's a place worse than hell?

32:24.793 --> 32:27.961
Oh, and way more creative
with what they plug

32:27.996 --> 32:29.896
all of your openings up with.

32:29.932 --> 32:31.723
I'm not ready.

32:31.729 --> 32:33.807
I'm not ready to go anywhere.

32:40.442 --> 32:42.375
Hello, Penny.

32:42.410 --> 32:43.910
Let's chat.

32:46.615 --> 32:49.550
I've missed this.

32:50.118 --> 32:52.418
But it doesn't change anything.

32:54.957 --> 32:56.922
You know what Margo's doing right now?

32:56.958 --> 32:58.324
She's convincing the Stone Queen

32:58.359 --> 33:00.926
that we'll get magic back.

33:00.962 --> 33:02.428
Because we will.

33:02.464 --> 33:04.821
And she's threatening her with it.

33:04.827 --> 33:08.334
If I'm lying, invade later and kill me.

33:08.369 --> 33:11.471
But if I'm not, do you
really wanna fight

33:11.506 --> 33:14.963
righteously pissed off
Magicians who can finger-blast

33:14.969 --> 33:18.844
your entire army into fucking compost?

33:20.982 --> 33:22.873
And is that your strategy as well?

33:22.879 --> 33:24.539
To threaten me?

33:24.545 --> 33:26.264
I'd be well within my rights,

33:26.270 --> 33:28.794
given that your army
is about to attack us.

33:30.973 --> 33:34.959
But no, I'm not threatening you.

33:34.995 --> 33:38.930
- I am promising you...
- What exactly?

33:39.113 --> 33:41.414
On the off chance this is true,

33:41.449 --> 33:44.116
what're your plans for taking
back control of the thrones?

33:44.152 --> 33:46.451
Once we give back magic to the people,

33:46.487 --> 33:49.042
we won't have to take anything.

33:49.556 --> 33:51.524
Hell, they'll be begging us

33:51.530 --> 33:53.497
to take back our thrones.

33:53.527 --> 33:55.857
Our Magicians can identify

33:55.863 --> 33:58.135
anyone with magical talent.

34:00.634 --> 34:03.001
And it's likely that many
of your people have it

34:03.036 --> 34:05.337
without the education to know it.

34:08.175 --> 34:10.141
So we'll educate them.

34:10.177 --> 34:12.554
Soon you could have magic

34:12.560 --> 34:14.650
as powerful as ours.

34:27.114 --> 34:29.089
I usually like to keep
a certain amount of

34:29.094 --> 34:31.067
distance between myself
and the residents,

34:31.081 --> 34:34.766
but you are just so fucking fascinating.

34:35.442 --> 34:36.541
What?

34:36.547 --> 34:39.303
I've never seen anyone fight
their destiny so hard

34:39.339 --> 34:42.505
while simultaneously propelling
themselves towards it.

34:42.542 --> 34:44.944
I mean, you narrowly escaped death.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.310
Twice.

34:46.346 --> 34:49.213
And then still snuck
into the Underworld.

34:49.248 --> 34:50.648
Who does that?

34:50.683 --> 34:53.683
Yeah, I still have no idea who you are.

34:54.031 --> 34:55.473
Hades.

34:56.222 --> 34:58.420
Hades.

34:58.456 --> 35:01.057
- Like the god?
- Shh.

35:01.092 --> 35:04.360
I told you, low profile.

35:06.898 --> 35:10.532
Okay, so what the hell are
you doing talking to me?

35:10.568 --> 35:13.746
- Look, is this about the metro...
- No, it's not about that.

35:13.824 --> 35:16.238
It's much more big picture.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.541
Let's talk about your
future as a Librarian.

35:19.577 --> 35:21.076
Or not.

35:21.111 --> 35:23.746
This is about that Quest, isn't it?

35:23.781 --> 35:26.214
Let me tell you something about that.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.803
It doesn't matter.

35:28.857 --> 35:30.518
Easy for a god to say.

35:30.553 --> 35:31.992
Spoiler alert...

35:31.998 --> 35:34.694
Magic always comes back.

35:34.724 --> 35:37.392
It may take a millennia
and your entire species

35:37.427 --> 35:40.362
verging on the brink of
extinction, but it will.

35:40.695 --> 35:42.563
Because ultimately,

35:42.599 --> 35:44.573
magic's a carrot gods use

35:44.579 --> 35:46.975
to keep humans in check.

35:47.336 --> 35:49.470
It's a lot to take in, I know.

35:49.506 --> 35:53.001
My point is, your life as a human,

35:53.610 --> 35:56.411
it's like your memories
before the age of three.

35:56.446 --> 36:00.281
This Quest, your friends,

36:00.316 --> 36:02.249
in a thousand years,

36:02.285 --> 36:04.510
hazy at best.

36:05.187 --> 36:07.921
Your life starts now,

36:08.178 --> 36:10.014
after death.

36:10.100 --> 36:12.326
And yes, I realize the
phrasing is confusing.

36:12.361 --> 36:14.561
Okay, what... what is this?

36:14.814 --> 36:16.159
Is this some kind of fucked up

36:16.165 --> 36:17.690
punishment for stealing a metro card?

36:17.696 --> 36:20.266
Hardly. There are a lot of
places you could've ended up

36:20.302 --> 36:22.938
that aren't nearly as
nice as the Underworld.

36:22.944 --> 36:25.399
Shackled to a trolley re-shelving books?

36:25.405 --> 36:28.274
We're in the greatest Library
in the entire universe

36:28.310 --> 36:30.444
with almost an eternity to explore it.

36:30.479 --> 36:33.947
And if you want the
shackles off, go to Howard.

36:34.164 --> 36:37.432
So I have to join a book
club to free myself?

36:37.467 --> 36:40.468
All anyone's offering you
is a chance to participate

36:40.504 --> 36:42.637
and be part of something.

36:42.672 --> 36:45.006
You've got that whole loner thing,

36:45.041 --> 36:47.975
but it's obviously a front.

36:48.011 --> 36:50.811
Ever since that trip to
Savannah with your real mom,

36:50.847 --> 36:52.780
you've been desperate
to prove your worth.

36:52.815 --> 36:55.284
Yeah, okay, you and
everyone else down here

36:55.290 --> 36:57.484
that's read my book...
what, you just think you know me?

36:57.520 --> 36:59.492
But it's why you're always sacrificing

36:59.498 --> 37:00.997
yourself for people, right?

37:01.003 --> 37:03.991
To remind them how important
you are to the group?

37:04.027 --> 37:05.778
If you're that desperate to

37:05.784 --> 37:07.533
move on and maybe somehow

37:07.563 --> 37:10.452
fumble your way back to your old life,

37:10.458 --> 37:12.759
I won't stop you.

37:13.068 --> 37:15.536
But I'm telling you, Penny,

37:15.571 --> 37:17.954
if you stay down here,

37:18.126 --> 37:21.415
you've got an amazing
destiny ahead of you.

37:22.289 --> 37:25.057
You've just gotta choose it first.

37:37.336 --> 37:41.038
And that should be the
last keystone, right?

37:44.771 --> 37:46.738
I don't understand.

37:50.561 --> 37:52.228
Would you stop...

37:52.234 --> 37:53.780
You keep acting like this is your book.

37:53.786 --> 37:54.952
Maybe 'cause I've been on the Quest

37:54.988 --> 37:56.354
for more than two minutes...

37:56.389 --> 37:59.289
Guys, snoop-and-poop voices. Please.

37:59.825 --> 38:01.692
You're hiding something from me.

38:01.727 --> 38:03.460
Why don't you just ask me
what you wanna ask me?

38:03.496 --> 38:05.629
Guys, seriously, I just got
out of a fantasy prison,

38:05.664 --> 38:07.435
and I don't wanna end up in a real one.

38:07.441 --> 38:09.519
Are you working for the Library?

38:09.806 --> 38:11.027
Yes.

38:11.033 --> 38:12.999
Surprisingly honest. That's...

38:13.506 --> 38:14.971
Are you trying to stop us?

38:15.007 --> 38:16.473
No.

38:16.716 --> 38:19.594
They wanna help us. They want
magic back as badly as you do.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.315
Well, I find that a
little hard to believe,

38:21.321 --> 38:23.585
given what they did to Harriett
and Victoria and Penny.

38:23.608 --> 38:26.350
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about Victoria?

38:32.717 --> 38:34.297
You're welcome.

38:35.887 --> 38:38.509
Yeah, you boned me, but

38:38.707 --> 38:40.784
you also saved my life.

38:41.393 --> 38:42.939
And I left you

38:44.045 --> 38:46.148
alone when I shouldn't have.

38:51.302 --> 38:55.370
Christ, okay, just go see
your family alread...

38:58.575 --> 39:01.376
No, I... I don't... I don't understand.

39:01.412 --> 39:03.064
What's to understand? They helped me.

39:03.070 --> 39:05.670
They wanna help us.
How is any of that bad?

39:08.752 --> 39:10.719
Sorry, are you smoking right now?

39:11.057 --> 39:13.013
I was stoked to go on this

39:13.019 --> 39:15.461
Quest and hang with you guys, but...

39:16.393 --> 39:19.394
My ex is dead, and you two are
setting my ball hairs on end.

39:19.430 --> 39:21.142
I need this.

39:21.148 --> 39:22.931
I'm just glad I was a genius

39:22.966 --> 39:24.732
who stashed high-end
party treats all over

39:24.767 --> 39:27.268
while I was Substitute High King.

39:30.808 --> 39:33.242
If the Library wanted to help,

39:33.248 --> 39:35.882
why hide it from me?
Why not just tell me?

39:35.917 --> 39:37.451
Because I know you.

39:37.486 --> 39:39.804
And I know how you'd react. And you did.

39:39.991 --> 39:41.144
Guys.

39:41.594 --> 39:42.826
Guys.

39:42.832 --> 39:44.198
Guys!

39:44.204 --> 39:46.605
I know where the Sixth Key is.

39:46.769 --> 39:48.702
Where?

39:50.419 --> 39:54.887
I'm sorry that we couldn't
save more of your kind.

39:55.103 --> 39:58.042
Had it not been for you,
they'd all be dead.

39:58.287 --> 40:00.644
I choose to be grateful.

40:02.013 --> 40:04.939
I won't tell anyone about
what you did tonight.

40:05.779 --> 40:07.913
It's too late.

40:07.948 --> 40:10.983
There are consequences to broken deals.

40:11.019 --> 40:13.357
Our word will mean nothing.

40:13.363 --> 40:15.329
I'm sorry.

40:18.626 --> 40:20.826
Of all the humans that
have ever sough me out,

40:20.861 --> 40:22.405
you're the only one

40:22.411 --> 40:24.501
who didn't do it for personal gain.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.386
If more were like you,

40:27.392 --> 40:29.858
we might have been able to coexist.

40:30.137 --> 40:31.628
We still can.

40:33.706 --> 40:35.585
We could at least try.

40:36.676 --> 40:39.744
You and your companions
are on a Quest, correct?

40:39.779 --> 40:42.280
For seven keys?

40:42.315 --> 40:43.960
Yes.

40:44.330 --> 40:47.667
We have one of the keys
in the Fairy Realm.

40:49.022 --> 40:51.822
But it's what created

40:51.858 --> 40:54.692
and sustains the Fairy Realm.

40:54.727 --> 40:57.798
Without the key, everything collapses,

40:59.131 --> 41:01.966
which is why we can
never give it to you.

41:06.774 --> 41:09.741
_

41:12.211 --> 41:14.036
Howard.

41:16.682 --> 41:19.049
What's your stupid book club reading?

41:38.869 --> 41:40.903
Gill and Stacey...

41:40.938 --> 41:43.872
Greatest love story ever written.

41:43.908 --> 41:47.343
He's handsome and tough
and misunderstood,

41:47.378 --> 41:49.178
but... but with a heart of gold.

41:49.214 --> 41:51.581
And she is a driven woman

41:51.616 --> 41:54.386
just trying to make it in
a man's world. So good.

41:54.760 --> 41:57.093
I'm su... I'm sure it is.

41:57.285 --> 41:59.452
Penny, meet Kathy.

41:59.458 --> 42:00.889
Kathy, Penny.

42:00.925 --> 42:02.141
Sup?

42:03.227 --> 42:05.027
He supped me.

42:05.062 --> 42:07.229
It's just like I always imagined.

42:07.264 --> 42:10.365
Penny, try one of Kathy's cupcakes.

42:10.400 --> 42:13.536
I promise you won't regret it.
