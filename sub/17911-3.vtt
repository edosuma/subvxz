00:01.100 --> 00:04.000
(electronic music)

00:07.933 --> 00:10.433
(car beeping)

00:11.833 --> 00:12.867
* Come on home

00:12.867 --> 00:14.433
* Come on home baby now

00:14.433 --> 00:16.100
* You know I'm
waiting here for you *

00:16.100 --> 00:18.533
* I'm coming home
now real soon *

00:18.533 --> 00:19.867
* You've been gone

00:19.867 --> 00:21.167
* Coming home baby now

00:21.167 --> 00:22.767
* You don't know what
I'm going through *

00:22.767 --> 00:24.867
* I'm coming home I
know I'm overdue *

00:24.867 --> 00:26.267
* Since you went away

00:26.267 --> 00:29.400
* Expect me any
day now real soon *

00:29.400 --> 00:33.000
* I'm coming home and
never more to roam *

00:33.000 --> 00:37.933
* Baby I'm for
sure coming home *

00:37.933 --> 00:38.800
* I'm coming home

00:38.800 --> 00:40.433
* Come on home

00:40.433 --> 00:42.967
(upbeat music)

00:46.600 --> 00:48.133
- Good afternoon,
Mr. Prendergast.

00:48.133 --> 00:49.767
I'm your anesthetist,
Dr. Denyar.

00:49.767 --> 00:51.733
I am filling in for...

00:51.733 --> 00:52.867
Oh.

00:52.867 --> 00:54.333
- Dr. Gupta.

00:54.333 --> 00:56.433
- Dr. Gupta, yes, yes.

00:56.433 --> 00:58.833
He had a family emergency,
he had to fly home.

00:58.833 --> 01:00.300
- They didn't tell me
what a pretty replacement

01:00.300 --> 01:01.067
I'd be getting.

01:01.067 --> 01:02.800
(laughing)

01:02.800 --> 01:03.800
- Oh, no, no.

01:04.967 --> 01:06.233
I think that might be
the pre-med talking.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.300
- You are a lot
hotter than Dr. Gupta.

01:09.300 --> 01:10.800
(laughing)

01:10.800 --> 01:12.233
- Right, I just need to ask
you a couple of questions,

01:12.233 --> 01:13.133
Mr. Prendergast.

01:13.133 --> 01:14.967
- Matt, call me Matt.

01:14.967 --> 01:16.300
- Oh, we're supposed
to keep things

01:16.300 --> 01:17.600
a little bit formal here.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.867
- Formal?

01:18.867 --> 01:20.767
I'm in a gown and I'm
not wearing any pants.

01:20.767 --> 01:22.067
(giggling)

01:22.067 --> 01:23.067
- Fair enough.

01:23.067 --> 01:25.100
Hi Matt, I'm Bess.

01:25.100 --> 01:26.267
- I like your eyes.

01:26.267 --> 01:27.567
- Oh.

01:27.567 --> 01:29.067
- Oh, sorry.

01:29.067 --> 01:33.467
So it's keyhole surgery of the
shoulder, the left shoulder?

01:33.467 --> 01:34.300
- This one?

01:35.333 --> 01:37.533
- Yes, that one, uh-huh, yep.

01:37.533 --> 01:39.433
- It's sore, Doctor.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.467
- Funny, it looks
pretty perfect to me.

01:42.467 --> 01:44.200
No, I'm so sorry, it doesn't.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.300
Sorry, that was a joke.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.467
I'll just pop that back on.

01:47.467 --> 01:49.433
So, are you on any other
medication at the moment?

01:49.433 --> 01:50.267
- Oops.

01:50.267 --> 01:51.533
- What about aspirin?

01:51.533 --> 01:53.767
- Hey, who's the top
fuel racing fan here?

01:53.767 --> 01:55.067
- Top fuel?

01:55.067 --> 01:56.267
- That's the Wheelers,
that's Julie Wheeler,

01:56.267 --> 01:57.733
she's the driver.

01:57.733 --> 01:58.833
Did she have an operation here?

01:58.833 --> 02:00.333
Was that for her knee?

02:00.333 --> 02:01.967
- Do you follow the team?

02:01.967 --> 02:04.200
- Sort of, she's my auntie.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.067
- Your auntie?

02:05.067 --> 02:07.167
- Yep, Auntie Julie.

02:07.167 --> 02:09.800
- As in close family friend
that you call auntie?

02:09.800 --> 02:12.833
- No, as in she's my mother's
sister, so she's my auntie.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.067
I mean, they're not close,
they don't even speak.

02:15.067 --> 02:16.700
There's been, like,
some family feud

02:16.700 --> 02:17.833
for, like, a million years.

02:17.833 --> 02:21.733
Oh no, my gown needs fixing.

02:21.733 --> 02:23.833
- I will get the nurse for that.

02:23.833 --> 02:26.400
(upbeat music)

02:29.933 --> 02:32.467
You told me your
sister was dead.

02:32.467 --> 02:34.233
You said Susan was dead!

02:34.233 --> 02:35.200
- I never said that.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.067
- Yeah, you did.

02:36.067 --> 02:37.200
- You totally did.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.067
- I said she was dead to me.

02:40.067 --> 02:41.967
- Yeah, well you must've
said the to me part

02:41.967 --> 02:43.400
very bloody quietly.

02:44.833 --> 02:46.067
What are you looking at?

02:47.433 --> 02:48.500
Fuck off!

02:48.500 --> 02:49.367
- Swear jar.

02:49.367 --> 02:50.333
- This way, guys.

02:51.533 --> 02:53.233
Amber, they happen
to be very special!

02:54.433 --> 02:55.733
- Julie, don't you
think it's important

02:55.733 --> 02:57.200
that we know who's
in our family?

02:57.200 --> 03:00.100
- Obviously, I don't, otherwise
I would've said something.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.600
Anyway, now you know.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.667
- Well, what if we, you
know, married our cousin?

03:04.667 --> 03:05.500
(laughing)

03:05.500 --> 03:06.467
Not that we...

03:06.467 --> 03:07.300
(laughing)

03:07.300 --> 03:08.133
Not that I...

03:08.133 --> 03:08.967
That's not...

03:08.967 --> 03:10.467
Ah.

03:10.467 --> 03:11.733
But what if there were medical
issues we should know about?

03:11.733 --> 03:13.600
- There is nothing you
need to know about.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.800
- So, first we find
out we have a sister,

03:15.800 --> 03:17.367
then we find out
we have an auntie.

03:17.367 --> 03:18.233
- And cousins.

03:18.233 --> 03:19.733
(knocking)

03:19.733 --> 03:21.200
- Any chance of finding
out he's not our brother?

03:22.167 --> 03:23.067
- Thank you.

03:24.167 --> 03:25.567
- So why did you stop speaking?

03:25.567 --> 03:26.967
- Matt said there was
something about a feud,

03:26.967 --> 03:27.800
didn't he, mum?

03:27.800 --> 03:28.800
Was it over a will?

03:28.800 --> 03:30.067
- Was it about money?

03:30.067 --> 03:32.500
- Look, you are all
making too much of this!

03:32.500 --> 03:33.867
It was no big deal!

03:33.867 --> 03:37.800
My sister and I
just didn't get on.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.300
- He's on Facebook.

03:41.633 --> 03:43.200
- Is that him, mum?

03:43.200 --> 03:46.267
- Holy shit balls, you didn't
say he looked like that.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.100
- Like what?

03:47.100 --> 03:48.500
- Like yum.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.867
- Oh, do you think?

03:49.867 --> 03:51.633
Oh, I hadn't noticed.

03:51.633 --> 03:52.867
- Mum, look, this is him.

03:52.867 --> 03:56.633
- No, no, wait, wait, is
that your sister, Nan?

03:56.633 --> 03:57.600
- Oh, wait, I didn't
get to see her!

03:57.600 --> 03:58.867
- You're not going to either.

03:58.867 --> 04:00.500
- No, I just want
to see her face!

04:00.500 --> 04:01.667
- I don't want you
to see her face,

04:01.667 --> 04:03.133
I don't want you
to see his face.

04:03.133 --> 04:04.667
- Why, what happened?

04:04.667 --> 04:06.267
- For Christ's sake, Wayne,
will you get the front door

04:06.267 --> 04:07.967
and tell them to
go around the side?

04:07.967 --> 04:09.233
Listen to me,

04:09.233 --> 04:12.333
we don't speak to
that family, ever.

04:12.333 --> 04:13.333
End of story.

04:14.367 --> 04:15.800
You understand me?

04:18.233 --> 04:19.933
- Constable Miklis.
- Wayne.

04:19.933 --> 04:21.333
- Haven't seen you for a while.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.600
This about the abalone?

04:23.600 --> 04:24.400
- What abalone?

04:25.600 --> 04:27.067
- I dunno.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.200
- Wayne, this is is Cecelia
Banks from the council.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.067
- Hello, Mr. Wheeler.

04:31.067 --> 04:34.367
- We hear you've been having a
lot of visitors to the house.

04:34.367 --> 04:35.200
- Not really.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.600
- [Man] S'up, hey.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.100
- Oh, they're not visitors,
they're customers.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.800
- So it's true, you are selling?

04:42.800 --> 04:44.767
- Oh, not me, the boys.

04:44.767 --> 04:45.933
(laughing)

04:45.933 --> 04:49.067
Welcome to the
Princes of Protein.

04:49.067 --> 04:50.600
Kayne, you remember
Constable Miklis

04:50.600 --> 04:53.567
and this is my son
in law to be, Younis.

04:53.567 --> 04:55.367
They're the only things
in here not made in China.

04:55.367 --> 04:56.800
- It's top quality powder.

04:56.800 --> 04:57.600
Younis?

04:57.600 --> 04:58.433
- Absolutely.

05:00.067 --> 05:03.100
Over 12% improvement in
strength and stamina.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.533
- What areas are you
interested in working on,

05:05.533 --> 05:06.767
Constable Miklas?

05:06.767 --> 05:08.933
- Is this for the
council webpage?

05:08.933 --> 05:10.833
- This is for
evidence, Mr. Wheeler.

05:10.833 --> 05:12.100
- Wayne, this is illegal.

05:13.267 --> 05:14.100
- No, the boys got
it through customs.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.600
Kayne, get the receipt.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.600
- No, no, selling it, like
this, out of your house

05:17.600 --> 05:18.767
is illegal.

05:18.767 --> 05:20.200
- See you next
week, looking great.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.600
- You need a commercial
license to trade, Mr. Wheeler.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.067
- From my own
backyard, no I don't.

05:24.067 --> 05:25.067
- Where's your permits?

05:25.067 --> 05:25.800
Where's your public liability?

05:25.800 --> 05:27.333
Where's your insurance?

05:27.333 --> 05:28.233
- And where's your van with
the men and the white coats

05:28.233 --> 05:29.167
to take you away, lady,

05:29.167 --> 05:31.700
'cause you are seriously crazy?

05:31.700 --> 05:33.233
This isn't Westfield,

05:33.233 --> 05:35.200
this is a tent up
the side of a house.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.933
- No, it's a shop and
you have to dismantle it,

05:37.933 --> 05:39.400
doesn't he, Constable Miklis?

05:40.300 --> 05:41.533
- Sorry, Wayne.

05:41.533 --> 05:42.233
- [Cecelia] And then you
have to pay the fine.

05:42.233 --> 05:43.667
- What fine?

05:43.667 --> 05:46.167
- For running a shop
without a license, $2000.

05:46.167 --> 05:47.933
- Well we haven't
made any profit yet!

05:47.933 --> 05:49.400
- You're joking.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.933
- Dad, we've just started.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.400
- Mate, I was talking to her.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.233
- Oh.

05:53.233 --> 05:55.833
(upbeat music)

05:58.467 --> 05:59.300
- Awesome!

06:01.800 --> 06:03.067
Which side of the
bed do you want, dad?

06:03.067 --> 06:07.233
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.067
Hello?

06:08.067 --> 06:09.367
Yes, yes, it is.

06:09.367 --> 06:10.567
Yes, I'm sorry.

06:10.567 --> 06:13.167
I'm gonna need twin
beds for my son and me.

06:13.167 --> 06:15.067
Yeah, that's because my wife
was on the original booking,

06:15.067 --> 06:16.567
but she had to fill in at work

06:16.567 --> 06:18.200
and she decided it would
be a good life experience

06:18.200 --> 06:19.967
for my son to come
with me instead.

06:21.767 --> 06:22.600
Are you there?

06:22.600 --> 06:23.833
Yep.

06:23.833 --> 06:24.367
So, yep, do you
have another room?

06:24.367 --> 06:25.600
Sorry?

06:25.600 --> 06:26.833
Yes, no, I know
it's a busy week.

06:26.833 --> 06:29.133
Yes, I'm actually a
guest speaker, so.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.333
Okay, what about a folding bed?

06:32.333 --> 06:34.067
Oh, none, not one?

06:34.067 --> 06:35.333
Okay, that's perfect.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.133
- We're gonna have
the best time, dad.

06:38.133 --> 06:39.300
- We're not here
for the best time,

06:39.300 --> 06:41.067
we're here for an
architect's conference.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.333
I'm just gonna do some
tweaking on my speech, okay?

06:44.333 --> 06:45.900
- Put some more jokes in it.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.100
- No, what do you
mean more jokes?

06:47.100 --> 06:48.533
Plenty of jokes in here.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.133
- Well, I read on the
plane when you were napping

06:50.133 --> 06:51.833
and I think it could be funnier.

06:51.833 --> 06:53.067
- Funnier?

06:53.067 --> 06:54.467
Did you read the
bit where I wrote,

06:54.467 --> 06:56.633
"Denton Corker and
Marshall walk into a bar,

06:56.633 --> 06:58.433
"a steel bar protruding
from a building.

06:58.433 --> 06:59.433
"That'll teach 'em."

07:01.333 --> 07:02.600
Because they always
designed buildings

07:02.600 --> 07:04.333
with pieces sticking,
its architecture.

07:04.333 --> 07:06.233
Okay, fine, I'll
write more jokes.

07:06.233 --> 07:08.733
(dog barking)

07:11.067 --> 07:12.067
- All clear.

07:12.067 --> 07:12.833
Well?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.067
- That picture of Matt and
Susan is four years old

07:16.067 --> 07:17.600
and she's not on Facebook.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.667
- Well, that's the end of that.

07:18.667 --> 07:19.867
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:19.867 --> 07:22.367
No, it's not, we'll
go through Matt.

07:22.367 --> 07:24.333
- You heard mum,
we're not allowed.

07:24.333 --> 07:25.867
- We are grown women.

07:25.867 --> 07:28.667
We are entitled to know how
and to whom we are related.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.233
- To whom we are related,

07:30.233 --> 07:31.767
it's not the fucking
federal court.

07:31.767 --> 07:33.067
Do you have to be so stuck up?

07:33.067 --> 07:34.567
- I'm sorry,

07:34.567 --> 07:37.400
I don't speak like you because
I was raised somewhere else,

07:37.400 --> 07:38.600
remember?

07:38.600 --> 07:41.267
Because I, like
Susan, was a secret.

07:41.267 --> 07:42.567
- Boo hoo.

07:42.567 --> 07:43.400
- Amber.

07:44.733 --> 07:46.600
- All right, we'll help.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.433
- Really?

07:47.433 --> 07:48.367
Yeah!

07:48.367 --> 07:49.600
- Do not think about hugging me.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.333
- Okay, so, Matt is
married to Lauren.

07:52.333 --> 07:53.167
- Married?

07:53.167 --> 07:54.733
- To Lauren, four kids.

07:54.733 --> 07:55.933
- Four kids?

07:55.933 --> 07:57.067
- Why is that so surprising?

07:57.067 --> 07:58.833
Oh my God!

07:58.833 --> 08:00.233
You got it on with him.

08:00.233 --> 08:01.067
- What?

08:01.067 --> 08:02.467
That's ridiculous!

08:02.467 --> 08:04.067
- Why is that ridiculous?

08:04.067 --> 08:07.200
I would totally tap that, if I
didn't know he was my cousin.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.233
(electronic music)

08:09.233 --> 08:11.933
- Do you see why we have to
find out who they all are?

08:13.200 --> 08:14.233
Where are you going?

08:16.400 --> 08:19.333
- Oi, you two, go and
watch that at Nan's,

08:19.333 --> 08:20.533
in the lounge room.

08:20.533 --> 08:21.700
- Why?

08:21.700 --> 08:23.867
- Because I'm fumigating.

08:23.867 --> 08:24.700
Out!

08:27.200 --> 08:28.133
- He has sisters!

08:28.133 --> 08:29.600
- And four cheesecake shops.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.733
- Jodie and Brooke
are younger and--

08:30.733 --> 08:32.067
- Let's go now.

08:32.067 --> 08:33.300
We can ask him about
family medical stuff

08:33.300 --> 08:34.533
and get cheesecake.

08:34.533 --> 08:35.367
- We can't.

08:35.367 --> 08:36.533
Mum will find out.

08:36.533 --> 08:37.767
- We won't say who we are,

08:37.767 --> 08:38.700
we'll just flirt with
him, like Bess did.

08:38.700 --> 08:39.633
- I did not!

08:39.633 --> 08:41.133
I did not flirt with him.

08:41.133 --> 08:43.567
His gown fell and I just
happened to see his bicep,

08:43.567 --> 08:45.500
his deltoid and his
pectoralis major.

08:47.667 --> 08:50.400
And neither of you can go
because he knows who you are.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.300
- So who can we send
to ask questions?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.800
- Cheesecake?

08:54.800 --> 08:57.067
But you never let
me eat cheesecake!

08:57.067 --> 08:58.267
- I don't want you to eat it.

08:58.267 --> 08:59.500
- Oh.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.167
- I want you to do
some sniffing around

09:01.167 --> 09:02.833
in the cheesecake shop.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.967
- Bess, you know I'm not
comfortable in places

09:04.967 --> 09:08.067
where they wear polo shirts
with embroidered logos.

09:08.067 --> 09:09.633
- Mum, please!

09:09.633 --> 09:11.100
This is the only way to find out

09:11.100 --> 09:13.867
about my extended
biological family.

09:13.867 --> 09:17.500
Julie's very unhappy that
we know as much as we do.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.333
- She is?

09:18.333 --> 09:19.267
- Yes.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.067
She would be furious if she knew

09:21.067 --> 09:23.067
that we were going
behind her back.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.467
- Why didn't you say so?

09:24.467 --> 09:25.500
Of course I'll help.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.767
(laughing)

09:29.233 --> 09:30.667
- Just popping down to the
Thai for a feet and legs.

09:30.667 --> 09:31.500
- Feet and legs?

09:31.500 --> 09:32.767
Sounds serious.

09:32.767 --> 09:33.700
You still upset about
the girls finding out

09:33.700 --> 09:34.767
about your sister?

09:34.767 --> 09:35.600
- No.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.533
- Do you wanna talk?

09:36.533 --> 09:37.733
- It's feet and legs, babe.

09:37.733 --> 09:39.767
If I was upset,
it'd be a full body.

09:39.767 --> 09:41.233
Good luck with
the numbers, boys.

09:41.233 --> 09:43.600
- It'll be all right, just
need some creative accounting.

09:43.600 --> 09:47.167
- Seven, nine, 36
take away five, 400.

09:47.167 --> 09:48.967
- Did you carry the three?

09:48.967 --> 09:51.067
- Oh bum, start again.

09:51.067 --> 09:52.933
- Roughly speaking,
how much do you owe

09:52.933 --> 09:55.367
if you close up shop now?

09:55.367 --> 09:56.900
- 3600.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.167
- The bloody fine.

09:58.167 --> 09:59.300
- Oh yeah, the fine!

09:59.300 --> 10:01.533
- 5600.

10:01.533 --> 10:02.567
- This is not right.

10:02.567 --> 10:05.633
This is not right.

10:05.633 --> 10:06.767
Do you know what this is?

10:06.767 --> 10:07.967
- Not right?

10:07.967 --> 10:09.033
- This is the government
sticking their noses

10:09.033 --> 10:10.000
into our business.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.800
This is my house.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.033
I own it.

10:13.033 --> 10:14.300
- I thought the banks owned it.

10:14.300 --> 10:15.533
- Only on paper.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.400
They can't tell us what
we can and can't do

10:17.400 --> 10:19.000
on our own property.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.233
We're gonna fight this.

10:20.233 --> 10:22.267
We're gonna stand
up for what's ours.

10:22.267 --> 10:24.967
Kayne, did we buy the
castle DVD in Bali?

10:24.967 --> 10:25.800
- Yes.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.400
- Put it on.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.500
- Okay.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.833
- We're not gonna pay that fine.

10:29.833 --> 10:32.500
(upbeat music)

10:32.500 --> 10:34.600
- But Julie
completely flipped out

10:34.600 --> 10:37.333
and forbade us from talking
about them ever again.

10:37.333 --> 10:38.300
- Really?

10:38.300 --> 10:39.500
What's the big mystery?

10:39.500 --> 10:41.167
Well, no one knows,
so, of course,

10:41.167 --> 10:42.733
we're all dying to find out.

10:42.733 --> 10:45.300
- You should see how good
looking mum's cousin is, dad.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.733
- No, he isn't.

10:46.733 --> 10:47.567
What?

10:47.567 --> 10:48.567
Good looking?

10:48.567 --> 10:49.400
(laughing)

10:49.400 --> 10:50.233
Hi, darling.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.733
- Hi, mum, hi, Edwina.

10:51.733 --> 10:53.133
Sorry, dad, there
was only one robe.

10:53.133 --> 10:54.000
Do you mind?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.033
(knocking)

10:56.033 --> 10:57.867
- Why did you make me bring him?

10:57.867 --> 10:59.467
I've got my big speech,
he's gonna wreck it.

10:59.467 --> 11:01.433
- [Oscar] It's just
room service, dad.

11:01.433 --> 11:02.900
- I didn't order room service.

11:02.900 --> 11:03.733
- I did.

11:03.733 --> 11:04.800
Do you have a tip?

11:04.800 --> 11:05.633
Yep.

11:05.633 --> 11:06.867
Here's my tip,

11:06.867 --> 11:07.533
don't bring your son
away on a conference.

11:07.533 --> 11:08.400
I'm gonna go.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.633
(laughing)

11:09.633 --> 11:11.800
This is a $27 burger.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.233
- I only got the mini.

11:13.233 --> 11:15.167
- Oscar, we had dinner
provided by the conference.

11:15.167 --> 11:16.267
This is very greedy, mate.

11:16.267 --> 11:17.667
- I was starving.

11:17.667 --> 11:18.967
- I had food from the plane!

11:18.967 --> 11:21.767
I've got half a prawn
and dill sandwich here.

11:21.767 --> 11:23.600
- But that's been in your bag.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.933
- Oh, when did you
get so spoiled?

11:24.933 --> 11:27.167
That is completely fine, Oscar.

11:27.167 --> 11:28.067
- Then you eat it.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.133
- Happily.

11:32.733 --> 11:33.567
Mm.

11:35.267 --> 11:36.633
- Does it taste disgusting?

11:37.767 --> 11:38.600
- It tastes free.

11:44.233 --> 11:45.500
- Constable Miklis.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.900
- Wayne, what are
you doing here?

11:47.900 --> 11:49.167
- I'm a drug mule.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.467
(laughing)

11:50.467 --> 11:52.067
- Sorry?

11:52.067 --> 11:54.100
- Only kidding, it's what
Kayne and Younis call me

11:54.100 --> 11:56.200
when I help them
with deliveries.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.467
- Right.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.267
- And we'd like you to
have a tub on the house.

12:00.267 --> 12:02.900
You'll start seeing
improvements in your pecs first.

12:04.467 --> 12:05.800
- Wayne, if you're trying
to get me to drop the fine

12:05.800 --> 12:07.367
by giving me a gift.

12:07.367 --> 12:09.200
- I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.067
- I'm not issuing it,
it's a council's fine

12:12.067 --> 12:14.767
and if you're going
to contest it,

12:14.767 --> 12:16.867
you'll need to
present something,

12:16.867 --> 12:19.700
not a bucket of powder, to
show why you should be exempt.

12:20.700 --> 12:23.600
- Okay, thanks for your advice

12:23.600 --> 12:24.800
and on second thoughts,

12:24.800 --> 12:26.600
you're probably more
of a cardio man.

12:26.600 --> 12:29.700
(upbeat music)

12:29.700 --> 12:31.700
- Are you okay in there, dad?

12:31.700 --> 12:34.067
You've been in there for ages.

12:34.067 --> 12:35.600
Should I get the hotel doctor?

12:35.600 --> 12:37.267
- Just let me
focus on my speech.

12:38.467 --> 12:39.967
- Do you think it
was the sandwich?

12:39.967 --> 12:41.967
(gagging)

12:41.967 --> 12:43.733
(car screeching)

12:43.733 --> 12:45.967
- If you got rid
of the embarrassing
standard issue wheels,

12:45.967 --> 12:47.267
switch 'em up with
a 20 inch alloy,

12:47.267 --> 12:49.367
seriously consider a body kit,

12:49.367 --> 12:50.900
then this might
be worth driving.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.967
- Why does she have
to drive my car?

12:52.967 --> 12:54.567
- We may need a quick getaway.

12:55.767 --> 12:57.067
- Do you remember what
you have to ask him?

12:57.067 --> 12:58.733
- Family, relationships,
illnesses.

12:58.733 --> 13:00.733
- Please don't change
it from Classic FM.

13:00.733 --> 13:03.300
- I'm switching it from
bullshit eco mode to sport,

13:03.300 --> 13:05.400
so we can make an exit
less like a nun's Corolla.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.067
- Mum, you need to go.

13:07.067 --> 13:10.133
- Don't you dare pimp
my ride while I'm gone.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.600
I've seen the ads on Foxtail,

13:13.600 --> 13:15.433
I know what you people do.

13:15.433 --> 13:18.100
(upbeat music)

13:21.067 --> 13:22.833
- There's someone
here to see you, Matt.

13:25.133 --> 13:26.067
- [Matt] Can I help you?

13:26.067 --> 13:27.900
- Matt, Matt Prendergast?

13:27.900 --> 13:29.867
- That's right, and you are?

13:29.867 --> 13:31.400
- I am very pleased to meet you,

13:31.400 --> 13:32.467
that's what I am.

13:32.467 --> 13:34.567
I'm a big fan.

13:34.567 --> 13:36.267
- Of me?

13:36.267 --> 13:37.567
- Mm.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.600
- And of what you've
done with the shops.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.967
You have four, is that right?

13:41.967 --> 13:44.100
Well, my family does,
we run them together,

13:44.100 --> 13:46.067
that's my little sister
Jodie, right there.

13:46.067 --> 13:48.267
- Oh, they didn't
say she'd be here.

13:48.267 --> 13:49.167
- Who didn't?

13:50.333 --> 13:51.867
- Head office.

13:51.867 --> 13:53.100
- Oh.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.833
Are you interested in
buying a franchise?

13:54.833 --> 13:56.333
- Yes, yes, I am

13:56.333 --> 13:59.567
and everyone in the
family is well and fit

13:59.567 --> 14:01.400
to run a business, I mean?

14:01.400 --> 14:02.667
- Yes.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.067
- How about psychologically?

14:04.067 --> 14:05.367
Any mental illness?

14:06.533 --> 14:09.067
I mean, it must be quite
a toll on the family,

14:09.067 --> 14:11.500
running a cheesecake empire.

14:12.900 --> 14:15.133
The Murdochs of the mud cakes,
that's what they call you.

14:15.133 --> 14:16.167
(laughing)

14:16.167 --> 14:17.067
- Do they?

14:18.200 --> 14:19.767
I suppose it is a
bit of an empire.

14:19.767 --> 14:21.267
- Do you mind if
I take some notes?

14:21.267 --> 14:22.500
- Sure.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.733
Can I get you a
piece of cheesecake?

14:23.733 --> 14:25.833
- No, I'm a diabetic.

14:25.833 --> 14:27.100
What about you?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.267
- Am I a diabetic?

14:28.267 --> 14:29.200
No.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.633
- Any other autoimmune diseases?

14:30.633 --> 14:31.967
Alopecia, vitiligo?

14:31.967 --> 14:33.300
- Why are you interested
in a franchise

14:33.300 --> 14:34.833
if you're a diabetic?

14:34.833 --> 14:36.500
- Well, you don't just sit
here and eat cake all day,

14:36.500 --> 14:38.067
do you?

14:38.067 --> 14:39.533
Or your cholesterol levels
would be through the roof.

14:39.533 --> 14:42.200
How are your cholesterol
levels, by the way?

14:42.200 --> 14:43.067
- Fine.

14:43.067 --> 14:43.833
- And your mothers?

14:45.067 --> 14:46.067
- Are you gonna ask
me about my shoulder?

14:46.067 --> 14:47.100
- Should I?

14:47.100 --> 14:48.633
- It's just a bit weird.

14:48.633 --> 14:50.267
You're asking all this
stuff about my health

14:50.267 --> 14:52.300
and here I am with
my arm in a sling,

14:52.300 --> 14:53.533
you haven't even asked why.

14:53.533 --> 14:55.133
It's as if you already
know what happened.

14:55.133 --> 14:56.500
- No, I don't.

14:56.500 --> 14:57.967
- Really?

14:57.967 --> 14:59.600
You have no idea that I
had surgery on my shoulder?

14:59.600 --> 15:01.500
- Ooh, that sounds nasty.

15:01.500 --> 15:05.100
- So, aren't you gonna
ask whether it was
a workplace injury

15:05.100 --> 15:06.500
or some genetic defect?

15:06.500 --> 15:07.700
- Was it a genetic defect?

15:07.700 --> 15:09.633
- I knew it.
- You did?

15:09.633 --> 15:11.100
- You people.

15:11.100 --> 15:13.067
You can't actually believe
that someone genuinely

15:13.067 --> 15:14.300
hurt themselves at work.

15:14.300 --> 15:15.667
You have to blame
it on the family.

15:15.667 --> 15:18.067
You can't just
pay the insurance.

15:18.067 --> 15:18.900
You disgust me.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.067
(rock music)

15:51.900 --> 15:53.100
- Thank you, counselors.

15:56.367 --> 15:57.667
- That's the whole presentation?

15:57.667 --> 15:59.833
- I did also wanna ask
him about fixing the lid

15:59.833 --> 16:01.133
on our wheelie bin.

16:01.133 --> 16:03.400
- But I thought it
might be off topic.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.633
- It's all off topic.

16:04.633 --> 16:07.200
- How is what you just
did contesting the fine?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.067
- Because we're showing
them how good the powder is.

16:09.067 --> 16:11.967
- But you're not being fined
over the quality of the powder,

16:11.967 --> 16:13.767
you're being fined because
you don't have a license

16:13.767 --> 16:15.067
to sell it.

16:15.067 --> 16:16.267
- I appreciate you
concern, Edwina,

16:16.267 --> 16:17.833
but I think this should
get them over the line.

16:17.833 --> 16:19.300
Let's go, boys.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.100
- Wayne, wait.

16:21.567 --> 16:25.333
Let me write a couple of
notes for you, just in case.

16:25.333 --> 16:27.400
- All right, sweetie,
just in case.

16:29.900 --> 16:30.900
(gasping)

16:30.900 --> 16:32.300
- What did you find out?

16:32.300 --> 16:35.633
- Well, the lemon
merengue pie is delicious.

16:35.633 --> 16:37.067
- Mum!

16:37.067 --> 16:38.400
- He was convinced the
insurance company had sent me

16:38.400 --> 16:40.067
to investigate his
shoulder injury.

16:40.067 --> 16:43.067
I had to buy $200 worth of
cheesecakes to distract him.

16:43.067 --> 16:44.367
- Did you get serviettes?

16:44.367 --> 16:46.067
- [Jodie] Excuse me.

16:46.067 --> 16:46.833
- Oh.

16:47.933 --> 16:49.500
It's the little sister, Jodie.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.533
- Fuck, duck!

16:51.833 --> 16:53.267
- [Jodie] You left your
credit card behind.

16:53.267 --> 16:55.067
- Oh, thank you so much.

16:55.067 --> 16:56.333
How silly of me.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.700
- No worries.

16:57.700 --> 16:58.967
- Oh, hi, mum.

16:58.967 --> 16:59.800
(gasping)

16:59.800 --> 17:01.333
- She said mum.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.567
It's Jodie's mum, it's Matt's
mum, it's Julie's sister!

17:02.567 --> 17:04.700
- Thanks for the
update, detective.

17:04.700 --> 17:05.800
- No, no.
- No!

17:05.800 --> 17:06.733
- Find out stuff.

17:10.600 --> 17:13.900
- I don't think I
said thank you for...

17:13.900 --> 17:15.733
Oh, I didn't see.

17:17.133 --> 17:18.300
Do you need a hand?

17:18.300 --> 17:20.700
- Oh, that's really
nice, thanks.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.333
I'm good.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.600
- [Susan] My handbag.

17:23.600 --> 17:25.233
- [Jodie] Oh, I've
got your bag, mum.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.467
- Is she all right?

17:29.467 --> 17:31.900
- Oh, well she can't
speak, walk or swallow,

17:31.900 --> 17:34.600
but apart from that,
she's absolutely fine.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.267
Anyways, see ya,
have a good one.

17:41.433 --> 17:43.067
- She can't walk or swallow.

17:43.067 --> 17:44.567
What's that, Bess?

17:44.567 --> 17:46.067
- Oh my God, I think it's
ALS, a motor neuron disease.

17:46.067 --> 17:47.900
I've always been worried
I'm gonna get that.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.100
- Seriously, this is about you?

17:50.100 --> 17:52.433
- No, no, no, of course not.

17:52.433 --> 17:57.433
I'm just saying it's
hereditary, 5% of the time,

17:58.300 --> 18:00.567
which is 50/50 in my head.

18:00.567 --> 18:02.700
(beeping)

18:04.967 --> 18:06.867
(alarm sounding)

18:06.867 --> 18:09.767
(electronic music)

18:33.767 --> 18:35.500
- [Both] Princes of protein!

18:35.500 --> 18:36.667
- Woo!

18:36.667 --> 18:39.300
Oh wow, that was awesome.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.500
That was just like having
Magic Mike at work,

18:41.500 --> 18:42.467
but with more clothes on.

18:42.467 --> 18:44.400
No, very clever, guys.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.400
- So, in conclusion, I
think you'll agree that

18:46.400 --> 18:48.067
the protein powder works.

18:48.067 --> 18:48.967
- It sure does.

18:48.967 --> 18:51.300
Wow, yes siree Bob.

18:51.300 --> 18:52.567
- So, the fine?

18:52.567 --> 18:53.500
- Yeah, you can pay
that at the counter

18:53.500 --> 18:54.433
at the front of the building.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.700
- Hang on, you just said that--

18:55.700 --> 18:57.200
- Mr. Wheeler, it's not
the quality of a powder

18:57.200 --> 18:58.200
that's the issue.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.200
- That's what Edwina said.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.967
- I know what Edwina said.

19:00.967 --> 19:01.867
- She's so smart.

19:03.067 --> 19:04.100
- Hang on a sec.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.633
Further to our display,

19:06.633 --> 19:08.533
I would just like to add

19:08.533 --> 19:11.533
Kayne and Younis
are two young guys

19:11.533 --> 19:13.067
with a dream.

19:13.067 --> 19:16.067
They remind me of two other
young guys with a dream,

19:16.067 --> 19:19.867
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.067
Just like Kayne and Younis,

19:21.067 --> 19:22.600
those guys didn't have any money

19:22.600 --> 19:25.100
when they created their
first Apple computer

19:25.100 --> 19:28.067
in their parents' garage.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.533
Just like the
Princes of Protein,

19:29.533 --> 19:34.367
Microsoft, Disney, Google all
began as backyard endeavors.

19:34.367 --> 19:37.900
I didn't know that,
until I wrote this.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.267
If the government is truly
committed to economic growth,

19:40.267 --> 19:44.100
then Kayne and Younis should
be rewarded, not punished.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.667
We implore you to
make them exempt

19:45.667 --> 19:49.067
from this punitive $2000 fine.

19:50.133 --> 19:52.867
Oh, and fix our
broken wheelie bin.

19:52.867 --> 19:54.333
- How about this?

19:54.333 --> 19:55.900
What if you pay for a
temporary trading license

19:55.900 --> 19:57.567
and we forget all
about the fine?

19:59.067 --> 20:00.833
And we have a look
at your wheelie bin.

20:00.833 --> 20:01.667
- Fantastic.

20:02.567 --> 20:04.533
How much is the license?

20:04.533 --> 20:07.500
- That one is 2500.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.367
- We'll pay the fine.

20:11.367 --> 20:13.167
- Any chance of an encore, boys?

20:14.433 --> 20:16.233
- Can't believe you
went behind my back.

20:16.233 --> 20:18.800
I told you, I explicitly said

20:18.800 --> 20:21.767
that it was none
of your business!

20:21.767 --> 20:24.100
It was certainly
none of her business.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.733
- Well, it became
all of our business

20:25.733 --> 20:27.767
when we found out that
your sister has ALS.

20:27.767 --> 20:30.800
- No, no, it was my decision
and you had no right!

20:32.800 --> 20:33.633
She's got what?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.600
- ALS.
- What's that?

20:36.600 --> 20:38.167
- The ice bucket challenge, mum.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.733
- She's dying?

20:43.733 --> 20:46.367
(upbeat music)

20:50.500 --> 20:51.767
- Heyo, man.

20:51.767 --> 20:54.400
- Dad, you look so
much less green.

20:54.400 --> 20:58.067
- Oh, I don't even
remember coming to bed.

20:58.067 --> 21:01.500
- I kind of dragged you in
here the night before last.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.267
- Night before, what day is it?

21:04.133 --> 21:05.600
- Saturday.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.433
- Saturday?

21:08.233 --> 21:09.200
I missed my speech.

21:10.367 --> 21:12.300
Oh, oh, I spent so
long on that paper!

21:12.300 --> 21:13.533
- I know, dad.

21:13.533 --> 21:14.333
- I was writing
more jokes for it!

21:14.333 --> 21:15.567
- [Oscar] I know, dad.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.300
- Oh, it would've gone
over very strongly!

21:17.300 --> 21:18.200
- It did, dad.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.267
- What do you mean it did?

21:21.267 --> 21:24.067
- And this is what I call
the light bulb moment,

21:24.067 --> 21:27.067
the precise point in
time where pragmatism

21:27.067 --> 21:29.433
and idealism collide.

21:29.433 --> 21:31.200
- Oscar, you gave my speech.

21:32.067 --> 21:34.267
Why would you do that?

21:34.267 --> 21:36.200
- I knew how important
it was to you.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.533
Speaking of light bulbs,

21:39.533 --> 21:42.600
how many architects does it
take to change a light bulb?

21:42.600 --> 21:43.900
None.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.400
They have to get a
builder to do it.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.800
- That's not my joke!

21:46.800 --> 21:48.633
You put your jokes
into my speech!

21:48.633 --> 21:50.467
- Well, 'cause you got sick.

21:50.467 --> 21:52.900
- Oscar, why would
you do that to me?

21:52.900 --> 21:56.133
Ah, my career is over!

21:56.133 --> 21:57.700
- People thought I was funny.

21:57.700 --> 21:58.967
Look at this bit.

21:58.967 --> 22:01.600
What is it with my
dad, the architect?

22:01.600 --> 22:04.900
He loves the Sydney Opera
House, inspired by an orange,

22:04.900 --> 22:08.133
but he hates the big
banana inspired by a banana

22:08.133 --> 22:10.700
and don't get him started
on the big pineapple.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.233
(laughing)

22:12.233 --> 22:14.667
You've been a great crowd,
thank you and good night.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.767
(cheering and applause)

22:15.767 --> 22:18.367
(upbeat music)

22:30.633 --> 22:31.800
- Mum's very nervous,

22:31.800 --> 22:33.967
everyone on their best behavior.

22:33.967 --> 22:34.967
Amber.

22:34.967 --> 22:35.800
- Why you picking on me?

22:35.800 --> 22:37.267
Mum, you look fantastic.

22:37.267 --> 22:40.133
(family chattering)

22:40.133 --> 22:40.967
(doorbell ringing)

22:40.967 --> 22:41.833
- I can't do it.

22:41.833 --> 22:42.967
- Yeah, you can.

22:42.967 --> 22:45.233
- But Bess isn't even here yet.

22:45.233 --> 22:46.367
- She messaged me.

22:46.367 --> 22:47.800
"On my way with Margaret,

22:47.800 --> 22:50.567
"but first time ever she's
been pulled over for speeding."

22:50.567 --> 22:52.533
- Told her sport
motor's quicker.

22:52.533 --> 22:53.767
- I'll get the door.

22:53.767 --> 22:56.400
(upbeat music)

22:59.333 --> 23:01.767
- Hi, I'm Brianna.

23:01.767 --> 23:02.600
This is Amber.

23:02.600 --> 23:03.667
- Hi, I'm Jodie.

23:03.667 --> 23:04.933
- Yeah, we know.

23:04.933 --> 23:08.500
I mean, hi, you must be
Brooke and you're Matt.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.067
- Yeah.

23:10.067 --> 23:11.067
- Ah, hello.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.900
- Hi, Julie, I'm Matt.

23:15.900 --> 23:17.567
- Matt, hi, last time I saw you.

23:19.600 --> 23:20.433
Hello.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.067
- You remember dad?

23:23.067 --> 23:25.067
- Whoa, Keith, you got old.

23:25.067 --> 23:26.300
- So how come you didn't?

23:26.300 --> 23:28.567
(laughing)

23:30.200 --> 23:31.400
- Thanks for coming.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.833
- Oh, thanks for inviting me.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.333
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

23:36.333 --> 23:37.167
I'm sorry.

23:38.067 --> 23:39.200
- I was hoping you'd say that.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.500
- Of course I would.

23:43.367 --> 23:44.667
So, how long have you got?

23:46.200 --> 23:47.067
- All afternoon.

23:48.233 --> 23:50.400
- No, no, I mean, you know,

23:51.867 --> 23:53.867
I actually thought
you couldn't walk.

23:55.300 --> 23:58.300
- Well, I couldn't last week,
but these boots are magic.

23:58.300 --> 24:00.133
I'm on the mend now.

24:00.133 --> 24:02.100
- What's wrong with you exactly?

24:02.100 --> 24:03.267
- I'm a klutz.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.367
- And she's stubborn
and impatient.

24:05.367 --> 24:08.067
- I had my wisdom teeth
out and I was a bit groggy

24:08.067 --> 24:09.400
from the painkillers.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.067
- She was told to stay in bed.

24:11.067 --> 24:12.333
- I got up to go to the loo.

24:12.333 --> 24:14.300
- And then she fell
and broke her ankle.

24:14.300 --> 24:15.500
(laughing)

24:15.500 --> 24:17.067
- That's all that's
wrong with you?

24:17.067 --> 24:18.700
- Oh, it's a nasty break.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.100
- So you're not dying?

24:20.100 --> 24:20.933
- Dying, me?

24:20.933 --> 24:23.333
No, God no, I hope not!

24:23.333 --> 24:25.967
- So you thought that I
was saying sorry for...

24:26.900 --> 24:28.133
Okay, get out.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.367
- What?
- Jules!

24:29.367 --> 24:32.067
- She's not dying,
she can leave.

24:32.067 --> 24:33.067
- Sorry we're late.

24:35.067 --> 24:35.833
- You're my...

24:37.900 --> 24:38.733
And you're...

24:39.933 --> 24:41.533
Oh, what the hell's
going on here?

24:41.533 --> 24:43.667
Is this some sort
of work cover sting?

24:43.667 --> 24:44.600
- I'm your cousin.

24:46.333 --> 24:47.533
I'm Janice.

24:47.533 --> 24:48.800
- You're Janice?

24:48.800 --> 24:49.700
- Yeah, okay, we've
all met each other.

24:49.700 --> 24:50.700
Susan was just leaving.

24:50.700 --> 24:51.500
- But I thought you gave her up.

24:51.500 --> 24:52.600
- And she found me.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.867
- And her name's Bess.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.467
- And this is her
mother, Margaret

24:56.467 --> 24:58.067
and we're all very close,

24:58.067 --> 24:59.800
aren't we, Margaret?

24:59.800 --> 25:01.100
- Mm.

25:01.100 --> 25:04.600
- So, we had a happy
ending after all,

25:04.600 --> 25:06.900
not quite the miserable life
you were hoping I'd have.

25:06.900 --> 25:07.800
- I never hoped.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.267
- Really, really?

25:09.267 --> 25:10.800
Because I seem to recall that
they were your exact words

25:10.800 --> 25:12.867
along with, oh
yeah, that's right,

25:12.867 --> 25:15.567
I'm the worst person in the
world for giving up my baby.

25:15.567 --> 25:17.667
- I should never have said that.

25:17.667 --> 25:19.200
I was scared.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.567
I had Matt at the same time,

25:20.567 --> 25:22.967
I was hoping we'd raise
our babies together.

25:24.133 --> 25:26.267
You didn't have to
stop speaking to me!

25:26.267 --> 25:28.933
- Of course I had to
stop speaking to you,

25:28.933 --> 25:33.633
you had Matt and I
didn't have Janice!

25:36.667 --> 25:38.233
Bess.

25:38.233 --> 25:39.400
- Oh my God.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.533
I didn't understand.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.933
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.300
Jesus, what a terrible sister.

25:49.933 --> 25:52.167
- Yeah, well,

25:53.800 --> 25:56.400
don't get me started on how
you used to wear my clothes

25:56.400 --> 25:57.300
without asking.

26:00.533 --> 26:01.300
- I'm sorry.

26:03.067 --> 26:03.933
- I'm sorry too.

26:08.500 --> 26:11.233
- I just wanted to say
I very much enjoyed

26:11.233 --> 26:12.867
the Belgian double choc.

26:13.967 --> 26:16.633
(upbeat music)

26:19.067 --> 26:21.200
- There's all your room
service and minibar paid for,

26:21.200 --> 26:22.367
you're welcome.

26:22.367 --> 26:23.500
- Are you still mad at me?

26:23.500 --> 26:25.367
- Oh, mad, why would I be mad?

26:25.367 --> 26:26.733
- [Conrad] Oscar.

26:26.733 --> 26:28.533
- Hey, Conrad.

26:28.533 --> 26:30.567
So glad I caught you.

26:31.900 --> 26:34.267
Oh, you must be Danny
Bright, Conrad Gardner.

26:34.267 --> 26:35.200
- I know.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.900
Yes, yeah and I'm a big fan.

26:36.900 --> 26:39.067
- Incredible speech,
congratulations.

26:39.067 --> 26:41.067
- Well, I mean, it's
maybe not as I intended.

26:41.067 --> 26:43.933
- Your thoughts on project
conception were groundbreaking

26:43.933 --> 26:46.200
and this guy, hold the phone,

26:46.200 --> 26:49.233
his warmth and charisma
delivering your words,

26:49.233 --> 26:51.400
it was the moment
of the conference.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.133
How funny is he?

26:53.133 --> 26:54.367
- Is he?

26:54.367 --> 26:55.667
- Have you seen
the Facebook page?

26:55.667 --> 26:56.967
It's all anyone's talking about.

26:56.967 --> 26:58.467
- Well, yeah.

26:58.467 --> 27:00.233
I mean, you know, I mean,
we're a bit of a double act.

27:00.233 --> 27:01.233
- I'd love to do lunch.

27:01.233 --> 27:02.467
- Me too.
- Awesome.

27:02.467 --> 27:04.767
Oscar, keep in touch.

27:07.267 --> 27:08.167
- It really went well.

27:08.167 --> 27:09.533
- Dad, I killed.

27:10.967 --> 27:12.633
- Oh, thank you, really.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.333
Oscar, you're amazing.

27:16.533 --> 27:17.667
Let's look at the
Facebook comments.

27:17.667 --> 27:19.767
(upbeat music)

27:19.767 --> 27:22.100
(laughing)

27:33.100 --> 27:35.933
- So, we're fine, as long
as we sell within the law.

27:35.933 --> 27:37.100
- Like in a garage sale.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.833
- Which would be
every second Saturday.

27:38.833 --> 27:40.100
- And every third Monday.

27:40.100 --> 27:41.700
- And every Wednesday
between six and eight.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.733
- And every other
Thursday before breakfast.

27:43.733 --> 27:45.233
- Yeah, like, Friday
weeks, we could do.

27:45.233 --> 27:46.967
- Alternate public holidays.
- Yeah.

27:46.967 --> 27:48.200
- In the mornings.

27:49.767 --> 27:51.200
- [Kayne] Edwina, and
what nights do you
think we should do?

27:51.200 --> 27:53.867
(upbeat music)
