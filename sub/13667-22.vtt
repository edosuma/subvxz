<i>Tonight on st. Elsewhere.</i>

00:04.442 --> 00:08.583
The only reason I ever got
involved with you is because
we had great Sex.

00:10.785 --> 00:13.688
I was puttin' out the fire
when the medication Room
was broken into.

00:13.755 --> 00:17.558
Peter, both you and I know
you have a drug addiction.
I am innocent.

00:17.625 --> 00:22.897
Hey! Cut it out!
You'll kill him!
He's wearing a pacemaker!

00:22.964 --> 00:26.401
So the bum caught me
with a hammer. I still got
my shots in, right?

00:26.467 --> 00:29.670
Aren't you supposed to be
watching Dr. Craig's kid?
Have you seen him?

00:29.737 --> 00:32.406
- Oh, my God. He's dead.
- How's Nina doing?

00:32.473 --> 00:34.642
Seventeen hours
and no change.

00:34.709 --> 00:36.544
Ready? Push.

00:36.611 --> 00:39.447
[ grunting, panting ]

02:20.248 --> 02:22.517
what news of
the maternity ward?
[ Sighs ]

02:22.583 --> 02:26.621
Nina's been in labor for
three hours. She's dilated
only two centimeters.

02:26.688 --> 02:30.758
But she's fine. We're gonna
hang in there with natural
childbirth all the way.

02:30.825 --> 02:34.696
Sorry about bringing you back
down here, but as you can
see, we've been bombarded.

02:34.762 --> 02:37.799
Anything serious?
No. A bus sideswiped
the old state House.

02:37.865 --> 02:41.035
The building's fine.
Mostly Everybody else
is just shook up.

02:41.102 --> 02:44.539
To be honest, I needed to
get out of the labor room
for a little while.

02:44.605 --> 02:46.674
Having a baby
is not easy.

02:46.741 --> 02:50.178
[ chuckles ]
tell that to Nina.
Shirley, you jest.

02:50.244 --> 02:54.315
We got a pool going
on your kid's weight and
the length of Nina's labor.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.551
It's only a buck.
You stand to make a fortune.

02:56.617 --> 03:01.022
Problem is, the only
Spot left is 36 hours,
12 pounds, female.

03:01.089 --> 03:04.559
No, thanks.
You never know. She could be
a female shot-Putter.

03:04.625 --> 03:07.295
Thank you.

04:04.652 --> 04:07.155
â™ªâ™ª [ soft rock ]
Dr. White.

04:07.221 --> 04:10.892
Yeah.
I thought I smelled smoke
coming out of the men's room.

04:10.958 --> 04:13.928
Big deal. Probably
some orderlies
puffing on reefer.

04:13.995 --> 04:16.430
Will you check?

04:16.497 --> 04:19.567
Yeah. What's the matter?
You afraid to go
in there alone, honey?

04:19.634 --> 04:21.601
Oh, come on.

04:24.539 --> 04:27.208
It's in there, Dr. White.

04:27.275 --> 04:29.344
Wait.

04:29.410 --> 04:32.747
Holy-- Call a code red.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.550
John, call
a code red!

05:21.829 --> 05:24.999
Excuse me.
Is there a Mr. Custodi here?

05:26.467 --> 05:28.669
Gene custodi?

05:28.736 --> 05:30.705
[ sighs ]

05:33.574 --> 05:35.476
Mr. Custodi?

05:37.945 --> 05:40.548
How long has he been here?

05:40.615 --> 05:42.583
Gene? Gene?

05:45.453 --> 05:47.388
Oh, man.
What have we got here?

05:47.455 --> 05:50.258
Uh-- Oh, boy.

05:50.324 --> 05:53.695
Give me a hand here, Shirley.
How could you let him
sit here this long?

05:53.761 --> 05:56.164
He was able
to fill out the forms.
He wasn't that out of it.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.166
His pupils
are dilated and equal.

05:58.232 --> 06:00.401
Seconal overdose.
We're gonna
have to lavage him.

06:00.468 --> 06:02.837
[ Daniels ]
Candy, we need you
over here!

06:07.642 --> 06:10.978
Nothing to be alarmed about.
They're probably here
visiting a sick dalmatian.

06:11.045 --> 06:13.348
Why don't you have
a seat.

06:14.615 --> 06:16.918
Mr. Davies?
Yes.

06:16.984 --> 06:19.420
Gratwick Davies?
That's me.

06:19.487 --> 06:21.956
You wanna follow me,
please?

06:27.929 --> 06:30.164
How does it look?
I think we got him in time.

06:30.231 --> 06:32.867

He's got a few bruised ribs
and he needs a tune-Up.

06:46.147 --> 06:48.049
Good.

06:55.456 --> 06:59.027
Dr. White,
we've got another problem.
What now?

06:59.093 --> 07:03.164
Somebody broke into
the medication room and stole
a whole lot of drugs.

07:03.231 --> 07:05.500
Where?
Down here.

07:09.537 --> 07:12.507
â™ªâ™ª [ Whistling ]

to talk to you.

07:16.744 --> 07:18.780
What for?
I don't know.

07:18.846 --> 07:20.782
It's just
a conditioned response.

07:20.848 --> 07:23.584
You know, dad,
like a Skinner box
or pavlov's dogs.

07:23.651 --> 07:26.454
I know, Steven.
This is my son.
Hi, Steven.

07:26.521 --> 07:29.090
You must be Victor Ehrlich.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.493
Steven is gonna watch me
repair a patent ductus
arteriosus right now.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.495
But after that,
he's all yours.

07:34.562 --> 07:38.299
<i>I expect you to make his
vacation from Med school
as informative as possible.</i>

07:38.366 --> 07:41.636
I want him to get the feel
of what the life
of a resident is all about.

07:41.703 --> 07:43.905
Okay.

07:43.971 --> 07:46.474
After all, he'll be
in your shoes next year.

07:46.541 --> 07:48.910
- Nice bucks.
- Thanks.

07:48.976 --> 07:52.513
Why don't we meet at the Fifth
floor Nurses' station,
oh, say noonish?

07:52.580 --> 07:55.750
- huh?
- Okay, 12:10 on the dot.

07:55.817 --> 08:00.722
I don't want him to
have any special handling
just because he's my son.

08:00.788 --> 08:03.691
Treat him like any other
top student of ohio state.

08:03.758 --> 08:05.727
Yes, sir.

08:10.565 --> 08:12.967
Where's the oxygen,
mahatma?

08:19.006 --> 08:21.843
Good. Son, that'll
clear up your hangover.

08:21.909 --> 08:24.779
Rough night,
Dr. Craig?
Are you kidding?

08:24.846 --> 08:27.882
My son and I were up late
celebrating his homecoming.

08:27.949 --> 08:29.851
Okay, let's get started.

08:32.285 --> 08:36.224
Well, whoever did it
really knew what he
or she was looking for.

08:36.289 --> 08:38.993
What did we lose?
You name it, it's gone.

08:39.059 --> 08:43.231
Enough morphine, diazepam and
seconal to keep the whole city
downed out for a month.

08:43.297 --> 08:44.899
[ sighs ]

08:44.966 --> 08:48.636
I went to the top on this one.
I talked to the commissioner
of police.

08:48.703 --> 08:52.006
He said they're gonna do
everything they can
to try and catch the guy.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.510
I'm no junior g-man,
but it seems pretty obvious
that whoever stole the drugs...

08:55.576 --> 08:58.112
started the fire
as a diversion.
Yeah.

08:58.179 --> 09:01.049
The commissioner asked me
if I thought it
was an inside job.

09:01.115 --> 09:02.984
What did you say?

09:03.051 --> 09:05.119
I said I didn't think so.
What do you really think?

09:05.186 --> 09:08.022
I don't know.
Who was the resident on call?

09:08.089 --> 09:10.825
Peter White.
Oh, boy.

09:14.796 --> 09:16.731
Hi.
Hi.

Hi, Nina.

09:19.133 --> 09:23.471
We've still got a ways to go.
I'm gonna do a pelvic exam
After the next contraction.

09:23.538 --> 09:26.441
Why don't you take off
for a while.
No, Thanks.

09:26.507 --> 09:29.944
Honey, you were in
E.R. Until 4:00 a.M.
And then came down here.

09:30.011 --> 09:34.148
Go and get some rest.
Nothing's gonna
happen in the next hour.

09:34.215 --> 09:37.385
She's in good hands.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.787
Okay, I'll be in on call.

09:43.925 --> 09:46.794
How are you feeling?
Great.

09:49.063 --> 09:51.866
Oh, here comes another one.

09:51.933 --> 09:54.902
Okay, now just Relax.
Breathe through it.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.106
That's right.

10:00.041 --> 10:02.010

Mm-Hmm.

10:06.981 --> 10:11.486
<i>[ auschlander ] it was a Monday.
I remember it like it
was yesterday. Cold, dry.</i>

<i>All I wanted to do
was get at the nazis,
so I enlisted.</i>

10:14.422 --> 10:17.458
<i>I didn't let them know
I was a doctor. I wanted
to get in the infantry.</i>

10:17.525 --> 10:20.895
I didn't know there
were any nazis in new guinea.
There weren't.

10:20.962 --> 10:23.531
Roosevelt saw fit to send me
after the japanese.

10:23.598 --> 10:27.135
I guess he knew how much
Macarthur needed me.
It's just as well.

10:27.201 --> 10:30.571
The war in Europe
was a nightmare.
What?

10:30.638 --> 10:32.607
No recurrent malaria,
no beriberi.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.443
All you guys got
was a developed taste
for French wine.

10:35.510 --> 10:38.346
We deserved it after
all that sicilian red
we drank.

10:38.413 --> 10:41.082
I bet you never
thought We'd miss 1943.

10:41.149 --> 10:44.519
No, I guess I never did.

10:44.585 --> 10:47.689
I do miss Rita, though,
all the time.

10:47.755 --> 10:49.691
Well, look at
the bright side.

10:49.757 --> 10:52.193
You're old,
you've got diseases,

10:52.260 --> 10:54.562
you've had heart surgery
and you're wearing a pacemaker.

10:54.629 --> 10:57.165

you should be with her
very soon.

I don't know whether
that's good news or bad news.

from Kelly street,
didn't we?

11:03.337 --> 11:05.506
Further than we probably
had any right to.

11:05.573 --> 11:08.142
We didn't end
up in jail like the rest
of the neighborhood.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.678
I guess we fooled
a lot of people.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.850
How did we get
to be so old?

11:15.917 --> 11:18.319
There's nothing wrong
with being old, Danny.

11:18.386 --> 11:21.956
It's just that a lot of people
our age give old a bad name.

11:23.658 --> 11:26.494
Where did the time go?

11:28.329 --> 11:31.799
Which reminds me,
Benny O'Neill died
a couple of months ago.

11:31.866 --> 11:33.801
Of what?

11:33.868 --> 11:36.904
I think it was emphysema
that finally killed him.

11:36.971 --> 11:39.507
I told him a hundred times
to quit smoking.

11:41.776 --> 11:45.713
You know, I like Boston.
Nice town.

11:45.780 --> 11:49.183
I feel the same way.
I couldn't live here Though.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.419
Why not?
I don't know.

11:51.486 --> 11:55.757
There's... too something.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.428
I know what you mean.

12:13.541 --> 12:16.344
Hey, David,
how's it going?

12:17.378 --> 12:20.248
David?

12:20.314 --> 12:23.885
What's the matter with him?
He get up on the wrong side
of Linda this morning?

12:23.951 --> 12:26.721
Dr. Westphall
wants to see you.

12:26.788 --> 12:30.858
My dad told me a lot about you.
Believe me, I'm not
as bad as all that.

12:30.925 --> 12:34.729
No, he admires you.
He sure has a funny
way of showing it.

12:34.796 --> 12:38.032
I know how demanding
he can be. How would you
like to be his son?

12:38.099 --> 12:41.836
They haven't
printed the money yet.
Time to check on a post-Op.

12:41.903 --> 12:44.138
And how are we today,
Marie?

12:44.205 --> 12:48.276
I'm ready to get out of here.
Looks like you're gonna
get your wish.

12:48.343 --> 12:50.478
Would you care to examine
the incision?
Sure.

12:50.545 --> 12:52.580
Who's he?
I didn't mean to be rude.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.950
Dr. Craig, this is Marie.
Marie, Dr. Craig.
Hi.

12:56.017 --> 12:57.985
Just hold it.
Hold it one second.

12:58.052 --> 13:00.621
I have been in this
Dung heap for two weeks...

13:00.688 --> 13:03.291
and Everybody's
been calling me
by my first name--

13:03.358 --> 13:05.560
the doctors, the nurses,
the orderlies.

13:05.626 --> 13:08.162
We try to be friendly
and informal.

13:08.229 --> 13:10.832
It's a one-Way street,
and I'm just sick of it.

13:10.898 --> 13:14.469
I don't know your first name.
I don't even know
if you have one.

13:14.535 --> 13:17.772
It never really
occurred to me.
No, it wouldn't.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.475
You guys are just trained
to be patronizing.

13:20.541 --> 13:22.477
You treat us
all like children.

13:22.543 --> 13:24.746
I'm 54 years old.
I got three kids.

13:24.812 --> 13:28.649
And if one of them dared
to call me Marie,
I'd smack 'em in the head.

13:28.716 --> 13:31.052
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Benzinger.

13:33.588 --> 13:35.890
[ sighs ]

13:35.957 --> 13:39.527
so much for dazzling you
with my bedside Manner.
Don't worry about it.

13:39.594 --> 13:42.497
My Dad says you just have to
let patients like that
roll off your back.

13:42.563 --> 13:44.766
Yeah. You won't tell him,
will you?

13:44.832 --> 13:47.735
Come on. He's my father.
Do you tell your father
everything?

13:47.802 --> 13:50.938
Not since fourth grade.
You're all right, Steven.

13:51.005 --> 13:55.276
Well, thank you.
It's about lunchtime.
Wanna grab a sandwich?

13:55.343 --> 13:57.578
Uh, no. Uh--

13:57.645 --> 14:00.882
actually, I'd rather
get high.

14:00.948 --> 14:03.184
Excuse me.

14:03.251 --> 14:07.555
Sinsemilla.
Humboldt County--
Blow your head off.

14:07.622 --> 14:09.691
You got a light?

14:15.063 --> 14:17.932
<i>What exactly
are you accusing me of?</i>

14:17.999 --> 14:20.802
I'm not accusing you
of anything. I just want
to know what happened.

14:20.868 --> 14:23.938
I was putting out the fire
when the medication Room
was broken into.

14:24.005 --> 14:28.543
It's all there in my report.
Or didn't you bother to read it?
Sit down.

14:30.978 --> 14:34.749
Dr. Westphall, I'm sorry.
This is a weird time for me.

14:34.816 --> 14:38.353
I know that,
and I appreciate it,

14:38.419 --> 14:40.988
but both you and I know
you have a drug addiction.

14:41.055 --> 14:44.726
I'm doing exactly what you
told me to do. I'm going
to the rehab center.

14:44.792 --> 14:47.729
I'm in the 21-Day program.
Good.

14:47.795 --> 14:50.098
That's good to hear.
I mean it.

14:50.164 --> 14:52.633
But, Peter,
knowing what I know,

14:52.700 --> 14:56.037
I'd be negligent
if I didn't ask you
about last night's break-In.

14:56.104 --> 15:00.007
I am innocent.
I swear it.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.379
Okay, fine.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.648
You believe me?
Just like that?

15:07.715 --> 15:09.684
Yep.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.225
You don't like me
very much, do you?

15:17.291 --> 15:20.328
Peter, I'm well aware
you've had...

15:20.395 --> 15:23.564
more problems this year
than anybody deserves,

15:23.631 --> 15:25.700
but I have to tell you
the truth.

15:25.767 --> 15:29.303
Every time I look at your
evaluation, one thing becomes
more and more clear to me.

15:29.370 --> 15:33.374

I really hope I win.
I could use the money.

Let me ask you a question.

28:29.484 --> 28:32.186
I have this friend--
my friend's boss has a son...

28:32.253 --> 28:35.523

my friend to baby-Sit at work.

No.

You sure you don't
want some soup?
No, thank you.

that the boss's son

and respects the boss,

In my family,
we have an old proverb--

"When you open your window
for fresh air,

you're bound to find

Look, I am
an anesthesiologist.

is abused,
all it causes is pain.

I shouldn't talk to Craig.

[ sighs ]
I miss providence.

43:00.621 --> 43:02.990
Yeah, me too.

43:08.229 --> 43:10.198
Come home.

43:20.441 --> 43:23.411
<i>[ thunderclap ]</i>

43:25.880 --> 43:29.684
it's happened three times
this month. We're not
gonna catch him. I know it.

43:29.751 --> 43:32.153
Mind if I have one?
Not at all. Go ahead.

43:32.220 --> 43:35.323
How 'bout you?
No.

43:35.390 --> 43:40.094
Suppose for now, we consolidate
the medication rooms by putting
them on every other floor?

43:40.161 --> 43:42.130
Sure.

43:44.399 --> 43:48.836
We could double security,
but either way, it's gonna
cause a lot of aggravation.

43:52.607 --> 43:55.476
We can talk about
this later if you like.

43:55.543 --> 43:58.913
Am I that distracted?
Yeah.

43:58.980 --> 44:01.115
Anything I can do?
Make me young.

44:01.182 --> 44:03.484
Yeah, wish I could.

44:04.952 --> 44:07.355
This afternoon
when I was thrashing
around with herbie--

44:07.422 --> 44:09.724
It's lucky the two of you
weren't killed.

44:09.791 --> 44:13.227
It'd been years
since I felt that vital.

44:13.294 --> 44:17.832
I realized what a mistake
I've made trying to grow old
gracefully.

44:17.899 --> 44:20.501
"Rage, rage, against
the dying of the light."

44:20.568 --> 44:24.739
Why shouldn't we?
Because, my friend,
it's a waste of time.

44:24.806 --> 44:28.876
But, Donald, won't you
at least admit you'd give up
everything you've worked for,

44:28.943 --> 44:32.980
learned, achieved,
to feel the way you were at 18?

44:33.047 --> 44:35.783
Of course.
But if we did,
where would that leave us?

44:35.850 --> 44:37.952
Confused, selfish,
immature.

44:38.019 --> 44:40.488
I, for one, wouldn't want
to go through that again.

44:40.555 --> 44:43.424
Well, I would, in a second.

44:43.491 --> 44:45.827
<i>[ thunderclap ]</i>

44:45.893 --> 44:49.464
Oh, Jack and Nina
Morrison had a baby boy
a little while ago.

44:49.530 --> 44:53.401
There's gonna be a party
on the fourth floor.

44:53.468 --> 44:55.703
Well, then, rather than dwell
on what's gone forever,

44:55.770 --> 44:59.073
perhaps it would be Wiser
to look to the future.

45:08.182 --> 45:10.118
congratulations, Luther.
Thank you.

45:10.184 --> 45:13.554
I thought it was
Jack Morrison's baby.
Luther had the winning time.

45:13.621 --> 45:18.192
Twenty-Two hours.
I could feel it in my Bones.
Where's my cash?

45:18.259 --> 45:21.295
Where's your ticket?
Huh? That's no problem.

45:21.362 --> 45:24.365
Don't worry.
I'll get it later.
Uh-Uh!

45:24.432 --> 45:28.002
No ticket, no money.
That's real cold, V.J.

45:28.069 --> 45:30.038
I'll be right back.

45:32.140 --> 45:35.209
Cathy, hi.
How 'bout a cigar?
Thank you.

45:35.276 --> 45:37.612
Want a light?
Oh, no.

45:37.679 --> 45:40.715
I need a refill.
Anybody else?
No.

45:40.782 --> 45:42.750
Me.
Okay.

45:50.358 --> 45:52.627
There you are.
I was getting worried.

45:52.694 --> 45:57.565
What's that awful smell?
I don't know.
Maybe my new Aftershave.

45:57.632 --> 45:59.667
[ sighs ]

45:59.734 --> 46:03.671
it smells like formaldehyde.
Well, I was in the morgue.

46:03.738 --> 46:06.374
Let me help you
wash it off.

46:06.441 --> 46:10.478
Shirley, let me explain.
I was just getting the latest
on the neilsen Autopsy.

46:10.545 --> 46:13.014
Hey, everybody,
here he is!

46:17.885 --> 46:20.288

someplace.

46:25.827 --> 46:28.696
Jack, Congratulations.
Thanks.

46:28.763 --> 46:31.165
How 'bout a cigar?
No, I don't smoke.

46:31.232 --> 46:34.302
Then get a drink.
Thanks.
It's quite a day.

46:34.369 --> 46:36.371
Yeah, I'll bet.

How's Gene custodi doing?
You make any progress
with him?

46:40.041 --> 46:43.678
Jack, listen.
It's a party.

46:43.745 --> 46:45.713
What's wrong?

46:47.015 --> 46:50.918
Custodi killed himself
a couple of hours ago.

46:50.985 --> 46:54.622
What?
He left a note.

46:54.689 --> 46:57.091
What'd it say?

46:57.158 --> 47:01.129
"I hope the next world
is better than this."

Right, dad?

That's right.
Should've guessed it.
