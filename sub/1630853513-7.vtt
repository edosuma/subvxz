33:14.191 --> 33:16.766
He, um, did not want me to stay,

33:16.791 --> 33:19.837
which is weird, because I have
excellent bedside manner.

33:19.862 --> 33:21.414
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

33:21.439 --> 33:23.844
Now that we know your illness
is related to Caulfield,

33:23.869 --> 33:25.297
we can find a cure for it.

33:25.322 --> 33:26.399
Maybe it's not an illness.

33:26.424 --> 33:29.133
I saw the future today, Guerin.

33:30.610 --> 33:32.123
When I first found out

33:32.148 --> 33:35.285
Grandma Patty was experimented
on, I was furious.

33:36.133 --> 33:39.735
But what if my genetic
inheritance isn't just...

33:40.845 --> 33:42.444
injustice?

33:42.469 --> 33:45.232
It's also actual superpowers.

33:46.735 --> 33:48.350
Saved a life today.

33:48.375 --> 33:49.973
And not just any life...

33:50.006 --> 33:51.907
Kyle Valenti's.

33:52.133 --> 33:53.642
Tomorrow,

33:53.675 --> 33:56.911
he's gonna turn around and
save five more lives.

33:57.213 --> 33:58.787
(CHUCKLES)

33:59.631 --> 34:00.840
Yeah.

34:01.831 --> 34:03.700
It's pretty awesome.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.820
Hmm, you smell like lighter fluid.

34:12.844 --> 34:15.500
(SNIFFLES) Which I guess is better

34:15.525 --> 34:18.933
than trashing Mom's car
with an electric outburst.

34:22.864 --> 34:24.208
Rosa.

34:24.322 --> 34:26.583
Look, I was gonna set her car on fire,

34:26.609 --> 34:28.552
but then I changed my mind.

34:31.781 --> 34:33.864
I don't know why I couldn't do it.

34:34.054 --> 34:36.493
She's hurt us so much.

34:37.245 --> 34:38.889
But then I saw you crying

34:38.915 --> 34:41.284
and it made me so angry

34:41.310 --> 34:43.077
and I felt helpless and I just...

34:43.101 --> 34:44.458
I couldn't rescue you,

34:44.484 --> 34:46.553
- and I'm sorry.
- Hey, I'm fine.

34:47.530 --> 34:49.580
Mom is gone,

34:50.161 --> 34:52.341
and she's never coming back.

34:53.781 --> 34:55.719
I survived.

34:59.753 --> 35:02.746
Liz, I blew up her car and
she still didn't stay.

35:02.771 --> 35:05.731
It's just... It's-it's all so pathetic.

35:08.954 --> 35:10.696
(SNIFFLES) We needed a mom.

35:10.861 --> 35:14.428
And it sucks that she
didn't need us back.

35:14.453 --> 35:15.697
But...

35:16.339 --> 35:19.041
- you know, there's a silver lining
- (SNIFFLES)

35:19.066 --> 35:20.828
in all of this.

35:21.688 --> 35:25.091
She's been sober for ten years.

35:25.988 --> 35:28.336
I saw her chip.

35:29.676 --> 35:32.714
If Hurricane Helena can pull through,

35:34.274 --> 35:35.761
so will you.

35:43.646 --> 35:45.715
(SNIFFLES)

35:59.431 --> 36:01.033
(EXHALES)

36:01.261 --> 36:02.761
What the hell happened?

36:02.788 --> 36:05.651
Eh, drunk driver tried to
turn me into roadkill.

36:05.676 --> 36:07.274
- (CHUCKLES)
- It's late.

36:07.299 --> 36:08.970
Why are you roaming around the hospital?

36:08.995 --> 36:10.110
I was up in the gallery

36:10.135 --> 36:13.423
contemplating American downfall,
thanks to progressive socialism.

36:13.718 --> 36:15.595
But, uh, Magic Mike

36:15.620 --> 36:18.447
- seems much more interesting.
- (CHUCKLES)

36:18.563 --> 36:20.165
You want to give me a hand?

36:20.190 --> 36:21.751
Yeah.

36:26.666 --> 36:28.727
- Squeamish all of a sudden.
- (CHUCKLES)

36:28.752 --> 36:30.032
What happened to the
girl who brought snacks

36:30.057 --> 36:31.243
- to an amputation?
- Okay, it's different

36:31.268 --> 36:33.068
when it's someone I...

36:34.756 --> 36:36.235
- Look.
- Huh.

36:36.260 --> 36:37.591
I-I don't really have friends.

36:37.616 --> 36:38.728
Mm.

36:38.753 --> 36:40.876
People tend to bail
when things get real.

36:41.014 --> 36:42.517
I'm not into that.

36:43.003 --> 36:44.298
And...

36:44.323 --> 36:45.824
sometimes there are days where I feel

36:45.849 --> 36:48.291
like you are the only
person who sees me.

36:52.005 --> 36:54.463
So it's a good thing that
you didn't get turned...

36:58.994 --> 37:01.386
The feeling is mutual.

37:22.992 --> 37:24.390
How did you...

37:24.415 --> 37:25.452
Don't worry.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.369
I didn't zap her. I swear.

37:27.394 --> 37:28.998
(CHUCKLES)

37:30.468 --> 37:33.001
I told you she didn't like cops.

37:33.026 --> 37:34.795
Yeah.

37:38.274 --> 37:40.462
About that, um...

37:40.558 --> 37:42.327
I got a call from my buddy Joe

37:42.352 --> 37:44.597
down at the station about Cameron.

37:44.622 --> 37:47.641
She hasn't been answering my
texts, and I was worried.

37:48.086 --> 37:49.476
Joe ran her plates,

37:49.501 --> 37:53.480
and her car was impounded
just a couple hours away.

37:53.806 --> 37:55.532
I mean, it's probably nothing,

37:55.557 --> 37:58.318
but I'm gonna look into it.

38:00.003 --> 38:02.074
And I'm turning in my badge and my gun,

38:02.099 --> 38:03.799
but I can't do desk duty.

38:03.824 --> 38:05.497
My friend might be in trouble.

38:05.522 --> 38:06.723
I get it.

38:06.748 --> 38:08.996
I love that about you.

38:11.235 --> 38:13.376
But it still scares me.

38:15.064 --> 38:17.380
I can't lose you again.

38:21.100 --> 38:22.535
You won't.

38:22.982 --> 38:24.386
I promise.

38:24.411 --> 38:25.985
Okay.

38:26.010 --> 38:30.225
And... I'm sorry I
snapped at you earlier.

38:32.119 --> 38:33.906
(INHALES)

38:33.931 --> 38:36.434
But, you know, now that, uh,

38:36.459 --> 38:38.462
we've had our first real fight

38:38.487 --> 38:40.431
- as a couple...
- Oh.

38:41.079 --> 38:43.939
I am not having makeup sex
with you in my dad's diner.

38:43.964 --> 38:45.282
Mm-mm.

38:46.649 --> 38:48.384
Pretty sure it's half yours now.

38:48.409 --> 38:49.703
(GASPS)

38:50.461 --> 38:52.247
(CHUCKLES)

38:53.157 --> 38:54.750
Mm-hmm.

38:54.775 --> 38:56.178
Mm.

39:04.029 --> 39:05.964
(EXHALES)

39:11.282 --> 39:15.486
Do you think that Noah chose me
because I was already broken?

39:17.137 --> 39:19.985
I think you are the only one of us

39:20.320 --> 39:22.110
who ever keeps it together.

39:22.135 --> 39:23.988
I'm serious, Michael.

39:24.421 --> 39:27.075
The night that drifter attacked me,

39:27.965 --> 39:30.577
why am I the only one who
started blacking out?

39:30.602 --> 39:32.704
I mean, Max literally murdered a man,

39:32.729 --> 39:34.290
but I'm the one who breaks?

39:34.315 --> 39:35.816
You were traumatized.

39:35.953 --> 39:37.306
We were kids.

39:37.331 --> 39:38.699
Yeah.

39:38.841 --> 39:40.420
At that age,

39:40.695 --> 39:43.231
trauma gets etched on to your soul.

39:44.634 --> 39:46.459
But what if it's not in my soul?

39:46.484 --> 39:49.096
What if it's in my DNA?

39:49.768 --> 39:52.086
Look, my whole life, I've
played Stepford wife

39:52.111 --> 39:54.220
because I thought that's
what I was supposed to do.

39:54.245 --> 39:55.386
But...

39:55.712 --> 39:58.480
I need to understand myself now.

39:59.234 --> 40:00.802
I need to know where I'm from.

40:00.827 --> 40:03.261
And if I don't know who my
biological parents are,

40:03.286 --> 40:05.612
how am I ever gonna
know who I really am?

40:07.516 --> 40:09.251
What are you saying, Iz?

40:09.276 --> 40:12.036
I know that we said we shouldn't
look into the past, but...

40:12.061 --> 40:14.163
It keeps pulling you back.

40:14.392 --> 40:16.040
Me, too.

40:17.570 --> 40:20.589
I spent my whole life thinking
I'd, uh, build a ship

40:20.614 --> 40:22.282
and blast off into the ether.

40:22.307 --> 40:25.799
And then, uh, the minute I
decide to leave that all behind

40:26.271 --> 40:29.003
and focus on this-this
good thing in front of me,

40:29.028 --> 40:30.846
I'm sucked back in.

40:31.511 --> 40:34.809
Maria's family was
experimented on at Caulfield.

40:37.314 --> 40:39.479
I need to find out more,

40:40.667 --> 40:43.317
so I can find a cure for her illness.
