09:51.215 --> 09:52.800
{\an8}- SO I WON'T SEE YOU
FOR A WHILE?

09:52.883 --> 09:53.884
{\an8}- PROBABLY NOT.

09:58.806 --> 09:59.849
{\an8}- RIGHT? MINE TOO.
[laughs]

09:59.932 --> 10:00.933
{\an8}[sighs]
- LIKE, EW.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.351
{\an8}HE JUST CAME IN HERE
AND JUST KISSED MY LIPS.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.519
{\an8}I WAS LIKE, PERFECT.

10:03.602 --> 10:05.813
{\an8}- SO WHAT'S UP? NOTHING.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.606
{\an8}I TOOK A SHOWER.
YEAH, NOW I'M COMING--

10:07.690 --> 10:09.567
{\an8}NOW I'M JUST DOING
WHATEVER.

10:09.650 --> 10:10.943
{\an8}- ANGELINA.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.029
{\an8}- WHAT?

10:13.112 --> 10:16.282
{\an8}I CAN CARE LESS.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.868
{\an8}SO...SORRY...

10:18.951 --> 10:20.911
{\an8}I WAS JUST TALKING
TO SOMEBODY.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.413
{\an8}ONE OF THE PEOPLE HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:22.496 --> 10:24.790
{\an8}NOTHING.
I'M SO [bleep] BORED.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.959
{\an8}AWESOME. OH, YEAH?
WHAT'D YOU HAVE?

10:27.043 --> 10:27.710
{\an8}[yawns]
YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT.

10:27.793 --> 10:28.753
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW, I'M JUST BORED.

10:28.836 --> 10:33.966
{\an8}- ANGELINA HAS NOT DONE
ONE THING IN THIS HOUSE.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.384
{\an8}SHE WAS ON THE PHONE
TALKING 24/7. BLEHH!

10:35.468 --> 10:37.386
{\an8}SHE'S SUCH A MORON.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.846
{\an8}- I REALLY MISS YOU GUYS.

10:38.929 --> 10:42.391
{\an8}UM, HOW'S MOM...
[indistinct]

10:42.475 --> 10:45.019
{\an8}UM...I KNOW.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.563
{\an8}HOW'S EVERYTHING?
HOW'S MY CAR?

10:47.646 --> 10:49.899
{\an8}WHERE YOU DRIVING TO?

10:49.982 --> 10:50.608
{\an8}WHAT'D YOU BUY?

10:50.691 --> 10:53.069
{\an8}- WOW.
- WOW IS RIGHT.

10:53.152 --> 10:53.861
{\an8}- YO, BITCH IS ON THE PHONE.

10:53.944 --> 10:54.737
{\an8}SHE DIDN'T DO THE DISHES,
NOTHING.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.990
{\an8}- YO, WHEN YOU'RE DONE
ON THE PHONE,

10:58.074 --> 11:01.243
{\an8}ANGELINA, CAN YOU HELP
CLEAN UP OVER HERE?

11:01.327 --> 11:02.286
{\an8}- YEAH, I JUST CLEANED
THE BATHROOM AND--

11:02.370 --> 11:04.914
{\an8}- YOU OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T CLEAN
THE [bleep] SINK!

11:04.997 --> 11:06.082
{\an8}- YEAH, DON'T [bleep] PUT THAT
ON ME RIGHT NOW

11:06.165 --> 11:08.000
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M GONNA--
- DO SOMETHING! SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

11:08.084 --> 11:09.877
{\an8}- I'M GONNA SMACK YOU
IN YOUR FACE!

11:09.960 --> 11:10.878
{\an8}- WHAT?
- SHUT UP!

11:10.961 --> 11:12.129
{\an8}- YOU'RE EXCLUDED.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.506
{\an8}- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]!
- YOU'RE EXCLUDED.

11:13.589 --> 11:14.882
{\an8}- I THINK THAT MIKE WAS
TOTALLY OUT OF LINE.

11:14.965 --> 11:18.177
{\an8}AND IF MIKE PISSES ME OFF
ONE MORE TIME,

11:18.260 --> 11:20.596
{\an8}I'M GONNA KEEP EXPLODING ON HIM
UNTIL I HIT HIM IN THE FACE.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.306
{\an8}- WE ABOUT TO EAT GOOD TONIGHT,
EXCEPT FOR ANGELINA.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.432
{\an8}- I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU--
I DON'T CARE.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.433
{\an8}I DON'T CARE!

11:24.517 --> 11:25.643
{\an8}- WE ABOUT TO EAT GOOD,
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.853
{\an8}- I DON'T CARE.
DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.772
{\an8}- CLEAN THE HOUSE,
YOU DIRTY MESS!

11:29.855 --> 11:32.024
{\an8}- SHUT THE [bleep] UP!

11:32.108 --> 11:33.526
{\an8}- SAY PLEASE. SAY PLEASE!
- YOU KNOW WHAT--

11:33.609 --> 11:35.861
{\an8}PLEASE HIT THE [bleep]
TREADMILL, PLEASE!

11:35.945 --> 11:38.697
{\an8}MAYBE IF YOU DID SOMETHING
IN THE HOUSE,

11:38.781 --> 11:39.865
{\an8}I WOULDN'T SAY NOTHING.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.034
{\an8}- I DO THE DISHES ALL THE TIME
IN THIS HOUSE!

11:42.118 --> 11:43.244
{\an8}- MY ASS! MY ASS!
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, SHUT UP.

11:43.327 --> 11:44.620
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT,
DON'T EVEN HIT THE TREADMILL.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.705
{\an8}HIT THE ELLIPTICAL.
IT'S BETTER FOR YOU.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.801
{\an8}- IT'S, LIKE, THE WORST THING
THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN.

11:58.884 --> 11:59.802
{\an8}- I KNOW THAT FEELING.

11:59.885 --> 12:03.139
{\an8}BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS--
YOU'LL GET OVER IT.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.808
{\an8}NICOLE IS REALLY UPSET OVER
THE WHOLE EMILIO INCIDENT,

12:05.891 --> 12:07.810
{\an8}SO I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF SHE WANTED TO GO OUT

12:07.893 --> 12:09.979
{\an8}AND GET SOME FRESH AIR
AND TAKE A WALK.

12:10.062 --> 12:14.191
{\an8}MY OPINION,
HE'S A PIECE OF [bleep].

12:14.275 --> 12:15.484
{\an8}HE DOESN'T DESERVE YOU,

12:15.568 --> 12:16.610
{\an8}'CAUSE YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG
DOWN HERE.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.822
{\an8}IF ANY PERSON IN THIS HOUSE
DESERVES SOMEONE

12:19.905 --> 12:23.200
{\an8}TO TREAT HER WITH RESPECT,
IT'S NICOLE.

12:23.284 --> 12:28.706
{\an8}[Nicole crying]

12:28.789 --> 12:31.167
{\an8}- I CAN'T DO THIS.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.835
{\an8}- AND IT JUST REALLY,
REALLY BREAKS MY HEART

12:32.918 --> 12:36.172
{\an8}KNOWING THAT THIS GIRL'S
GOING THROUGH THIS RIGHT NOW.

13:03.866 --> 13:07.870
{\an8}- WE NEED TINFOIL, GUYS,
FOR THE RAVIOLI OVER THERE.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.205
{\an8}WE NEED ANOTHER DISH
FOR THE MEATBALLS AND THE SAUCE.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.040
{\an8}- THAT'S GONNA BE GOOD.
LOOK AT THAT.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.083
{\an8}LOOK AT THAT.
- IT LOOKS GOOD.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.003
{\an8}- YOU SHOULD PUT THEM MEATBALLS
IN THE SAUCE, I'M TELLING YOU.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.338
{\an8}- OH, YEAH?
OH, GOOD IDEA.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.089
{\an8}- YOU'RE EXCLUDED
FROM ASPARAGUS NIGHT.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.799
{\an8}- YEAH.

13:23.802 --> 13:24.929
{\an8}- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.518
{\an8}- THAT FIGHT WAS KIND OF HEATED
BETWEEN MIKE AND ANGELINA.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.561
{\an8}THEY BOTH SAID
SOME THINGS THAT

13:32.645 --> 13:34.396
{\an8}YOU JUST DON'T SAY
TO YOUR ROOMMATES.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.439
{\an8}THEY KIND OF GOT
OUT OF LINE,

13:35.523 --> 13:36.357
{\an8}SO THERE'S A LOT OF TENSION
IN THE HOUSE NOW.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.195
{\an8}- ANGELINA, YOU'RE NOT--
YOU'RE--

13:41.278 --> 13:42.571
{\an8}I DIDN'T MEAN TO
SAY THAT [bleep] BEFORE.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.241
{\an8}I'M SORRY. I CAME HOME
IN A BAD MOOD.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.201
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT, MIKE,
I LOVE YOU, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,

13:47.284 --> 13:48.077
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
YOU SPEAK TO ME SOMETIMES.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.203
{\an8}I DON'T EVEN WANT TO FIGHT.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.829
{\an8}- WILL YOU EVEN LET ME
[bleep] APOLOGIZE?

13:50.913 --> 13:52.206
{\an8}ARE YOU [bleep] KIDDING ME?

13:52.289 --> 13:53.457
{\an8}- SO GO AHEAD.
I'M GONNA LET YOU TALK.

13:53.541 --> 13:57.253
{\an8}- I SAID I APOLOGIZE,
AND I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.421
{\an8}I CAME HOME, AND I WAS
IN A BAD MOOD OR WHATEVER.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.756
{\an8}OBVIOUSLY,
I WOULD NEVER NOT--

14:00.839 --> 14:02.091
{\an8}IF I COOKED DINNER,
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.218
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- OKAY.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.177
{\an8}- I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

14:05.261 --> 14:05.970
{\an8}I'M SORT OF A SOFTIE
SOMETIMES.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.180
{\an8}I CAN BE A SENSITIVE DUDE.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.433
{\an8}SO I HAD TO APOLOGIZE
TO ANGELINA,

14:11.517 --> 14:12.434
{\an8}AND WE'LL BE ABLE
TO MOVE FORWARD, MAN.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.227
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
WE'RE A BIG FAMILY.

14:13.310 --> 14:16.480
{\an8}- LOVE YOU.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.982
{\an8}- NOW YOU'RE NOT EXCLUDED
FROM SUNDAY DINNER.

14:18.065 --> 14:22.027
{\an8}NOW YOU'RE NOT EXCLUDED
FROM SUNDAY DINNER.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.154
{\an8}- MIKE APOLOGIZED, FINALLY.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.283
{\an8}THE SITUATION WAS A MAN
IN THAT SITUATION.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.492
{\an8}- NOW, UH, LET'S DIG IN.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.618
{\an8}- YES.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.704
{\an8}- LAMB CHOPS, ALL THAT [bleep].

14:31.787 --> 14:33.289
{\an8}- ACTUALLY, CAN I HAVE
AN EXTRA LAMB CHOP?

14:33.372 --> 14:33.914
{\an8}- THERE YOU GO, BABE.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.416
{\an8}- I THANK MIKE'S FAMILY

14:35.499 --> 14:36.375
{\an8}FOR TEACHING HIM HOW TO COOK.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.751
{\an8}WHOA, LOOK AT RONNIE!
I LOVE IT.

14:37.835 --> 14:41.213
{\an8}- OH, MY GOSH,
THIS IS ALL SO GOOD.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.132
{\an8}- HOW 'BOUT THESE MEATBALLS?

14:43.215 --> 14:46.093
{\an8}[laughter]

14:46.176 --> 14:47.094
{\an8}- SNOOK, IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT GIRL?

14:47.177 --> 14:48.887
{\an8}YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD.
- I'M OKAY.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.974
{\an8}- I NOTICED SNOOKI'S BEEN
MISERABLE LATELY.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.643
{\an8}LIKE, SHE HASN'T BEEN ABLE
TO BE HERSELF,

14:54.727 --> 14:55.519
{\an8}AND SHE HASN'T BEEN ABLE
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.146
{\an8}SHE'S STRESSING OVER EMILIO.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.606
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE TO SEE
SNOOKI SAD AT ALL.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.191
{\an8}WHOEVER IT IS, JUST GIVE ME
HIS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER,

15:01.275 --> 15:03.152
{\an8}AND I'LL HAVE HIM TAKEN CARE OF.
- SERIOUSLY.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.112
{\an8}TOMORROW.
- WE LOVE YOU, SNOOKS.

15:05.195 --> 15:07.990
{\an8}- IT'S ON LIKE DONKEY KONG.

15:08.073 --> 15:08.657
{\an8}- OH, [bleep].

15:08.741 --> 15:10.826
{\an8}- I'M GOING OUT.
- UH-OH.

15:10.909 --> 15:13.245
{\an8}- HMM, SINGLE?

15:13.329 --> 15:13.996
{\an8}- SINGLE, SNOOKS?

15:14.079 --> 15:16.957
{\an8}- WOW.
- WATCH OUT, MIAMI.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.000
{\an8}- I'M A STRONG GIRL.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.335
{\an8}IF YOU'RE GONNA
[bleep] ME OVER LIKE THAT,

15:19.418 --> 15:20.377
{\an8}THEN YOU'RE DONE,
AND I'M GONNA MOVE ON

15:20.461 --> 15:22.963
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW, BE SINGLE,
HAVE FUN.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.340
{\an8}- YOU ALL RIGHT, SNOOKS?

15:24.423 --> 15:26.383
{\an8}I GOT SOME SPECIAL DESSERT
FOR YOU, GIRL.

15:26.467 --> 15:29.136
{\an8}MY VANILLA ICE CREAM.
OOH, YOUR FAVORITE.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.847
{\an8}- OKAY.
[laughter]

15:31.930 --> 15:33.724
{\an8}I DID GET VANILLA ICE CREAM,
THOUGH, FOR REAL.

15:33.807 --> 15:34.850
{\an8}[laughter]

15:34.933 --> 15:38.395
{\an8}- THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
THE BEST MEAL YET.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.982
{\an8}- ALL THE GIRLS
ARE GONNA COOK?

15:42.066 --> 15:44.109
{\an8}I THINK IT WOULD BE HILARIOUS.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.862
{\an8}- THAT MEANS YOU CLEAN.
- I'LL CLEAN. I'LL CLEAN 100%.

15:46.945 --> 15:49.031
{\an8}- NEXT SUNDAY, I FEEL LIKE
THE GIRLS SHOULD COOK,

15:49.114 --> 15:51.825
{\an8}MAKE A MESS, AND HAVE
THE GUYS CLEAN IT UP.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.202
{\an8}- WE SHOULD GET
A COOKBOOK.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.995
{\an8}[laughter]

16:12.680 --> 16:14.223
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT?
- OH, MY GOD, I CALLED THAT OUT.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.724
{\an8}- YO, ARE YOU REALLY GONNA
DO THAT?

16:15.808 --> 16:16.642
{\an8}- SSSSS...

16:16.725 --> 16:18.477
{\an8}- I WANT TO WATCH THIS.
- HELL YEAH.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.978
{\an8}- THERE'S ALWAYS, LIKE,
A PROCESS

16:20.062 --> 16:21.897
{\an8}TO BREAKING UP WITH A GUY.

16:21.980 --> 16:22.898
{\an8}YOU NEED TO GET EVERYTHING
THAT REMINDS YOU OF HIM

16:22.981 --> 16:24.858
{\an8}OUT OF YOUR ROOM.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.069
{\an8}SO AT THIS POINT,
I'M DONE WITH THE KID.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.028
{\an8}I WANT NOTHING TO DO
WITH HIM.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.363
{\an8}I NEED TO BURN HIS PICTURES
ASAP.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.546
{\an8}- TOO BAD.
- NEXT.

16:45.629 --> 16:48.966
{\an8}- THIS IS FROM SUSHI SAMBA
IN THE CITY.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.428
{\an8}I PAID.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.762
{\an8}- GOOD-BYE, [bleep].

16:53.846 --> 16:56.765
{\an8}- LET IT BURN.

16:56.849 --> 17:00.269
{\an8}- YEAH, BURN!

17:00.352 --> 17:02.354
{\an8}- ALL THE ROOMIES KNOW
THAT I'M UPSET,

17:02.438 --> 17:03.939
{\an8}SO, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE BEING VERY NICE

17:04.021 --> 17:05.065
{\an8}AND SYMPATHETIC.

17:05.148 --> 17:08.109
{\an8}WORD OF THE DAY--SYMPATHETIC.
THAT'S A BIG WORD.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.903
{\an8}YAY!

17:33.635 --> 17:34.803
{\an8}WE ALREADY TYPED UP
THE LETTER FOR SAM.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.639
{\an8}WE FIGURE RIGHT NOW IS
THE RIGHT MOMENT TO DO IT.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.645
{\an8}YOU KNOW, RON IS PRETTY MUCH
PLAYING HER OUT,

17:43.729 --> 17:46.315
{\an8}AND THAT'S NOT COOL.

17:46.398 --> 17:47.483
{\an8}SHE IS OUR GIRLFRIEND.
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW.

18:00.871 --> 18:01.997
{\an8}- WE BOTH THINK
IT'S A HORRIBLE IDEA,

18:02.080 --> 18:05.459
{\an8}BUT IT'S, LIKE, AS LONG
AS SHE KNOWS, SHE KNOWS,

18:05.542 --> 18:08.086
{\an8}AND SHE CAN MAKE
HER OWN DECISION.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.172
{\an8}[knock on door]

18:10.255 --> 18:12.925
{\an8}- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:27.731 --> 18:29.358
{\an8}- GET ME THE [bleep] OUT
OF THERE.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.818
{\an8}- I'M NERVOUS.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.361
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW HOW
SHE'S GONNA REACT.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.821
{\an8}OH, DEAR.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.573
{\an8}I'M VERY WORRIED
THAT ONCE THIS GETS OUT,

18:36.657 --> 18:38.575
{\an8}ME AND RON ARE DONE
AS FRIENDS.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.919
{\an8}- WHAT'S THAT?
- YOU TELL ME.

18:49.002 --> 18:53.006
{\an8}SO I GET UP,
AND I FOUND THIS NOTE.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.049
{\an8}I'M SICK RIGHT NOW.

18:54.132 --> 18:56.301
{\an8}- THAT'S BULL[bleep]
FOR SOMEBODY TO TELL SAM

18:56.385 --> 18:57.553
{\an8}WHAT I DID
WHEN I WASN'T WITH HER.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.846
{\an8}THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

18:58.929 --> 18:59.263
{\an8}I WANT TO KNOW
WHO TYPED UP THE LETTER.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.751
{\an8}- YEAH. WAKE UP.

19:29.835 --> 19:33.547
{\an8}- [bleep].

19:33.630 --> 19:36.300
{\an8}- IT'S RAINING OUT.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.385
{\an8}- SO THE NOTE WAS DROPPED.
WE DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT.

19:38.468 --> 19:40.554
{\an8}IT WAS MORE SO, LIKE, JUST
GET IT DONE AND OVER WITH.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.973
{\an8}SEVEN PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE
KNOW THE TRUTH.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.684
{\an8}AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

19:45.767 --> 19:46.727
{\an8}I DIDN'T SLEEP
ONE BIT LAST NIGHT.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.729
{\an8}- ME EITHER.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.772
{\an8}- I WAS TOSSING AND TURNING
FOR HOURS.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.567
{\an8}I HAD THE WORST DREAMS EVER.
- ME TOO.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.694
{\an8}- THE WHOLE THING
IS JUST [bleep] UP.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.696
{\an8}BUT I LOVE SAM,
AND I JUST HATE TO SEE HER

19:57.779 --> 19:58.739
{\an8}GETTING [bleep] ON.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.575
{\an8}SO SHE NEEDS TO KNOW.

20:01.658 --> 20:04.745
{\an8}- EWW, IT'S DISGUSTING OUT.

20:24.097 --> 20:26.058
{\an8}[mews]

20:42.741 --> 20:46.536
{\an8}- SO I GET UP,
AND I FOUND THIS NOTE.

20:46.620 --> 20:51.583
{\an8}THIS NOTE PRETTY MUCH TOLD ME
THAT RON GETS WITH FAT CHICKS,

20:51.667 --> 20:55.587
{\an8}HOOKS UP WITH GIRLS,
HOLDS HANDS WITH GIRLS,

20:55.671 --> 20:56.755
{\an8}GOT A GIRL'S NUMBER.

20:56.838 --> 21:00.884
{\an8}EVERY [bleep] THING
RON HAS DONE TO ME HERE.

21:00.968 --> 21:01.843
{\an8}VIN.

21:01.927 --> 21:05.263
{\an8}[whispering]
COME HERE. VINCE, COME HERE.

21:09.851 --> 21:13.730
{\an8}JUST TELL ME
IF THIS IS TRUE.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.440
{\an8}I KIND OF, LIKE,
WANTED TO FIND OUT, LIKE,

21:15.524 --> 21:17.567
{\an8}WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON
BEFORE I OPEN UP MY MOUTH

21:17.651 --> 21:19.027
{\an8}AND KIND OF LOOK STUPID.

21:19.111 --> 21:19.820
{\an8}'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW, LIKE,
WHERE THIS NOTE CAME FROM.

21:19.903 --> 21:22.489
{\an8}I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.076
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW.
JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.661
{\an8}AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
RIGHT NOW, I NEED A FRIEND.

21:27.744 --> 21:30.080
{\an8}- I--SAM,
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

21:30.163 --> 21:32.582
{\an8}- DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
- ALL RIGHT.

21:32.666 --> 21:37.337
{\an8}- DON'T SAY--PROMISE?
- YEAH.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.548
{\an8}- PAULY. PAULY!

21:39.631 --> 21:45.262
{\an8}I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
TO KNOW, BUT...

21:53.770 --> 21:56.356
{\an8}- NO, I DEFINITELY
DIDN'T SEE THAT.

21:59.609 --> 22:02.779
{\an8}IF ANYTHING, I KNOW THAT.
'CAUSE I WAS DOING MY THING.

22:02.863 --> 22:03.739
{\an8}WE ALL WERE.
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.615
{\an8}- AS FAR AS THAT--
- WHY'D I GET THIS?

22:05.699 --> 22:06.408
{\an8}- I HAVE NO IDEA.
THAT'S CRAZY.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.827
{\an8}- RIGHT?
I FOUND IT IN MY DRAWER.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.078
{\an8}I'M NOT STUPID.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.246
{\an8}I'M PRETTY SURE
ALL THE GUYS, LIKE,

22:11.329 --> 22:12.748
{\an8}AREN'T GONNA SAY ANYTHING
TO ME.

22:12.831 --> 22:13.915
{\an8}I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF THEY WOULD.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.960
{\an8}BUT I FEEL LIKE I KNOW
WHEN SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

22:17.044 --> 22:17.919
{\an8}SO I JUST WANTED TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.839
{\an8}NOBODY'S REALLY
SPITTING ANYTHING OUT.

22:24.551 --> 22:28.722
{\an8}- MY EYEBALLS HURT.
I COULDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.640
{\an8}I FELT LIKE THERE WAS,
LIKE,

22:30.724 --> 22:33.143
{\an8}A BIG FAT ELEPHANT
IN THE ROOM.

22:33.226 --> 22:34.102
{\an8}- I SHOULDN'T HAVE DID THAT
RIGHT BEFORE BED.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.772
{\an8}I CAUGHT A MEAN ADRENALINE RUSH.
- ME TOO.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.982
{\an8}- DID YOU HEAR THE DRAWER OPEN?
- YEAH, I WAS, LIKE, OOH...

22:39.066 --> 22:41.276
{\an8}- [imitates rapid heartbeat]

22:41.359 --> 22:43.278
{\an8}- I WAS LIKE THIS, SLEEPING
WITH ONE EYE OPEN.

22:43.361 --> 22:46.156
{\an8}ME AND JENNY ARE TERRIFIED
TO COME BACK TO THE HOUSE

22:46.239 --> 22:48.867
{\an8}BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T WANT
TO DEAL WITH THAT DRAMA...

22:48.950 --> 22:49.826
{\an8}THAT WE'VE CAUSED.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.661
{\an8}I WONDER IF SHE'LL FIND IT
THIS MORNING.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.039
{\an8}- I KNOW...

22:58.794 --> 23:00.879
{\an8}- [clears throat]

23:12.557 --> 23:13.934
{\an8}- [snapping fingers]

23:32.911 --> 23:35.080
{\an8}YES.

23:36.748 --> 23:40.669
{\an8}- THIS IS [bleep] BULL [bleep].

23:40.752 --> 23:42.504
{\an8}I'M SITTING DOWN,
READY TO EAT MY FOOD,

23:42.587 --> 23:44.131
{\an8}AND VINNY'S, LIKE,
"THE [bleep] JUST HIT THE FAN."

23:44.214 --> 23:49.219
{\an8}SAM FOUND THE TYPED-UP LETTER
[bleep] FROM "ANONYMOUS."

23:49.302 --> 23:51.471
{\an8}[bleep] 12 YEARS OLD.
MAN UP!

23:51.555 --> 23:53.348
{\an8}[bleep] JERKOFFS!

23:53.431 --> 23:57.185
{\an8}PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE
[bleep] HAVE BIG [bleep] MOUTHS!

23:57.269 --> 24:01.231
{\an8}IF I FIND OUT IT WAS MIKE,
I'M BREAKING HIS [bleep] FACE.

24:07.571 --> 24:08.530
{\an8}WHAT'S THAT?

24:08.613 --> 24:11.032
{\an8}AT CLUTCH THAT NIGHT,
I GOT A GIRL'S NUMBER.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.410
{\an8}- YOU ASKED FOR HER NUMBER?
- I GOT HER NUMBER, YES.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.829
{\an8}- [bleep] YOU.

24:15.912 --> 24:16.705
{\an8}DID YOU LEAVE ME A NOTE?

24:16.788 --> 24:19.958
{\an8}- NO.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

24:33.013 --> 24:34.598
{\an8}- WHAT?

24:34.681 --> 24:36.057
{\an8}- WHAT'S THAT?

24:36.141 --> 24:38.143
{\an8}WHAT IS THAT?

24:38.226 --> 24:41.313
{\an8}- YOU TELL ME.
I FOUND THIS.

24:44.482 --> 24:47.444
{\an8}I FOUND THAT IN MY DRAWER
JUST NOW.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.408
{\an8}- RIGHT AWAY I KNOW IT'S
EITHER SNOOKI OR JENNY.

24:53.491 --> 24:55.744
{\an8}BUT THEN I READ THE LETTER,
AND I SEE THE WORD "WISELY,"

24:55.827 --> 24:57.871
{\an8}AND I KNOW SNOOKI DOESN'T USE
THAT KIND OF VOCABULARY.

24:57.954 --> 25:02.334
{\an8}EVERYONE IN THIS HOUSE HAS GOT
[bleep] BIG [bleep] MOUTHS!

25:04.211 --> 25:06.046
{\an8}I THINK THAT'S BULL [bleep]
FOR SOMEBODY

25:06.129 --> 25:07.464
{\an8}TO TYPE UP A LETTER
TO TELL SAM

25:07.547 --> 25:09.424
{\an8}WHAT I DID WHEN
I WASN'T WITH HER.

25:09.507 --> 25:10.550
{\an8}IT'S PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE
NOT MINDING

25:10.634 --> 25:13.220
{\an8}THEIR OWN [bleep] BUSINESS,
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

25:13.303 --> 25:15.138
{\an8}COME HERE, LOOK AT ME.
I WANT TO TALK RIGHT NOW.

25:15.222 --> 25:17.933
{\an8}- IT'S OKAY.
- NO, NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.435
{\an8}IT'S NOT OKAY.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.686
{\an8}YES, I WAS DANCING
WITH GIRLS.

25:21.770 --> 25:25.607
{\an8}YES, I TOOK SHOTS
BETWEEN SOME WAITRESS' BREASTS.

25:25.690 --> 25:28.818
{\an8}I WAS NOT HOLDING HANDS
WITH NO GIRL AT CLUTCH.

25:28.902 --> 25:30.946
{\an8}GOT HER NUMBER,
THREW IT AWAY.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.447
{\an8}COME HERE, COME HERE.
COME HERE, COME HERE!

25:32.530 --> 25:34.199
{\an8}- NO, THIS IS NOT--
- COME HERE.

25:34.282 --> 25:37.160
{\an8}- I'M DEFINITELY NOT A SAINT.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.328
{\an8}IF I PROBABLY WALKED
THROUGH CHURCH RIGHT NOW,

25:38.411 --> 25:41.248
{\an8}I'D [bleep] BURST INTO FLAMES,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

25:41.331 --> 25:42.624
{\an8}I'LL ADMIT THAT I WAS WRONG.

25:46.836 --> 25:51.508
{\an8}LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

25:51.591 --> 25:54.344
{\an8}- RONNIE CAN SAY ALL HE WANTS,
BUT AT THIS POINT,

25:54.427 --> 25:55.720
{\an8}HE ADMITTED TO SOME THINGS
IN THE NOTE.

25:55.804 --> 25:59.307
{\an8}SO I'M PRETTY SURE ALL
THE THINGS IN THE NOTE HAPPENED.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.267
{\an8}- I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THIS.

26:00.350 --> 26:01.476
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ANYMORE RIGHT NOW.

26:01.559 --> 26:04.813
{\an8}- LOOK AT ME, THOUGH.
I LOVE YOU.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.274
{\an8}LIKE, MORE THAN,
LIKE, ANYTHING.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.150
{\an8}LIKE, LOOK AT ME.
I WAS [bleep] HURT.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.235
{\an8}I MADE A MISTAKE...

26:10.318 --> 26:11.278
{\an8}- I'M JUST GOING
TO THE BATHROOM.

26:11.361 --> 26:13.280
{\an8}- YES, I'LL ADMIT IT.
I DID WHAT I DID, BUT...

26:13.363 --> 26:15.699
{\an8}- I'M JUST GOING
TO THE BATHROOM.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.788
{\an8}- I THINK I CAN
TALK MY WAY OUT OF THE HOLE

26:21.871 --> 26:24.082
{\an8}I'VE DUG MYSELF INTO.

26:24.165 --> 26:26.167
{\an8}I MEAN, HOW BIG'S A GRAVE,
SIX FEET?

26:26.251 --> 26:29.504
{\an8}I'M PROBABLY TWO AND A HALF,
THREE FEET DOWN RIGHT NOW.

26:29.587 --> 26:32.674
{\an8}THIS ISN'T FUNNY.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

26:32.757 --> 26:33.675
{\an8}- NO, NO, NO. I WANT TO KNOW
WHO TYPED UP THE LETTER.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.094
{\an8}WHO GOT TO A COMPUTER
TO TYPE UP A LETTER

26:36.177 --> 26:37.012
{\an8}AND PRINT IT OUT?

26:37.095 --> 26:40.849
{\an8}THE STUFF IN THE LETTER
WASN'T THAT BAD.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.559
{\an8}I'M MORE PISSED ABOUT
THE LETTER BEING ANONYMOUS,

26:42.642 --> 26:44.227
{\an8}BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT
I'M [bleep] STUPID

26:44.311 --> 26:45.812
{\an8}AND I'M NOT GONNA KNOW
WHO IT WAS.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.525
{\an8}- WHAT? WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED?

26:50.608 --> 26:54.195
{\an8}- SAM WOKE UP THIS MORNING
WITH A NOTE...

26:54.279 --> 26:56.489
{\an8}THAT SAID RONNIE WAS
HOOKING UP WITH GIRLS

26:56.573 --> 26:58.700
{\an8}THE NIGHT THAT
SHE LEFT CRYING.

26:58.783 --> 27:01.369
{\an8}THE NOTE WAS TYPED.

27:01.453 --> 27:05.165
{\an8}CRAZY, RIGHT?
- MMM.

27:05.248 --> 27:07.709
{\an8}I REALLY FEEL LIKE
THEY CAN'T BLAME ME

27:07.792 --> 27:10.503
{\an8}BECAUSE JENNY AND SNOOKI
WANTED ME TO GET INVOLVED,

27:10.587 --> 27:12.339
{\an8}BUT I WASN'T THERE
WHEN THEY TYPED UP THE LETTER.

27:12.422 --> 27:15.592
{\an8}SO I'M JUST GONNA SAY
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

27:15.675 --> 27:17.594
{\an8}AND STICK TO THAT.

27:17.677 --> 27:18.345
{\an8}IT'S CRAZY.

27:27.604 --> 27:28.980
{\an8}[telephone rings]

27:29.064 --> 27:30.982
{\an8}- EVERY TIME I HEAR
THE PHONE RING,

27:31.066 --> 27:32.275
{\an8}I THINK IT'S GONNA BE
THE HOUSE.

27:32.359 --> 27:34.694
{\an8}- I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.

27:34.778 --> 27:38.448
{\an8}- I'M SCARED TO GO HOME.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.513
{\an8}- SIT DOWN, TALK TO ME.

28:01.596 --> 28:05.100
{\an8}- I'M HERE IN A [bleep] HOUSE
WITH YOU,

28:05.183 --> 28:06.267
{\an8}OBVIOUSLY IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

28:06.351 --> 28:09.270
{\an8}- AND OBVIOUSLY
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

28:09.354 --> 28:09.938
{\an8}- YOU ARE, YOU JUST DON'T...
- I MADE A [bleep]--

28:10.021 --> 28:11.940
{\an8}[groans]
I MADE A MISTAKE.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.024
{\an8}I WAS HURT.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.276
{\an8}I HAD A MINDSET--
- YOU MAKE OUT WITH ANYBODY?

28:15.360 --> 28:17.445
{\an8}HOLD ON A SECOND.
DID YOU MAKE OUT WITH ANYBODY?

28:17.529 --> 28:18.488
{\an8}- I TOLD YOU ON THE PHONE--
- HOLD ON. SHUT UP.

28:18.571 --> 28:19.614
{\an8}- I DON'T REMEMBER MAKING OUT
WITH ANYBODY.

28:19.697 --> 28:22.283
{\an8}- NO, NO, NOT
"I DON'T REMEMBER."

28:22.367 --> 28:24.577
{\an8}YES OR NO?
- I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.291
{\an8}- DID YOU?
- NO.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.126
{\an8}- YOU DIDN'T MAKE OUT WITH
ANYBODY?

28:31.209 --> 28:35.130
{\an8}- NO.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.256
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD!

28:36.339 --> 28:37.841
{\an8}- AT THE CLUTCH THAT NIGHT,
I GOT A GIRL'S NUMBER.

28:37.924 --> 28:40.301
{\an8}- YOU ASKED FOR HER NUMBER?
- I GOT HER NUMBER, YES.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.346
{\an8}- I'M SICK RIGHT NOW.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.139
{\an8}BECAUSE I CAME HOME CRYING,

28:44.222 --> 28:46.641
{\an8}YOU ENDED UP
IN MY [bleep] BED.

28:46.724 --> 28:47.642
{\an8}[bleep] YOU.

28:47.725 --> 28:50.019
{\an8}AT THIS POINT,
I BELIEVE THE NOTE.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.980
{\an8}AND I LOOK LIKE A FOOL BECAUSE
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.731
{\an8}I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.

28:53.815 --> 28:56.234
{\an8}- AND I HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING, SAM, I [bleep].

28:56.317 --> 28:57.485
{\an8}- YOU KEEP ON...

28:57.569 --> 28:58.319
{\an8}- I [bleep] GOT
A GIRL'S NUMBER.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.488
{\an8}OKAY, I GOT A GIRL'S NUMBER.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.407
{\an8}I THREW IT AWAY.
I DON'T HAVE THE GIRL'S NUMBER.

29:02.490 --> 29:06.202
{\an8}- I GO HOME CRYING
OVER YOU,

29:06.286 --> 29:07.954
{\an8}AND YOU GET A GIRL'S NUMBER?

29:08.037 --> 29:10.874
{\an8}YOU WERE WITH ME.

29:10.957 --> 29:12.876
{\an8}- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
- YOU WERE WITH ME, AND YOU--

29:12.959 --> 29:14.919
{\an8}I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]!
LEAVE ME ALONE.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.504
{\an8}HAVE A GREAT TIME IN MIAMI
'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE DONE.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.841
{\an8}WE'RE DONE RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE THAT'S DISGUSTING.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.926
{\an8}- LIKE, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I CAME HOME TO <i> YOU.</i>

29:22.010 --> 29:25.054
{\an8}AND I'VE BEEN DEDICATED TO YOU
SINCE THAT [bleep] NIGHT

29:25.138 --> 29:25.805
{\an8}BECAUSE I MADE A MISTAKE.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.557
{\an8}EVERY DAY, I WAKE UP WITH YOU.

29:27.640 --> 29:28.892
{\an8}EVERY NIGHT,
I GO TO BED WITH YOU.

29:28.975 --> 29:30.852
{\an8}EVERY DAY, I SPEND MY WHOLE
[bleep] DAY WITH YOU.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.604
{\an8}YOU GET THAT?

29:32.687 --> 29:34.355

{\an8}- OH, GOD.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.115
{\an8}OH, BOY.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.911
{\an8}- I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY,
BECAUSE YOU'RE DUMB.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.496
{\an8}YOU'RE STUPID...

38:52.580 --> 38:54.123
{\an8}YOU'RE DUMB, YOU'RE SELFISH.

38:56.584 --> 38:57.918
{\an8}- IT'S NOT OKAY FOR ME
TO WANNA BE WITH YOU

38:58.002 --> 38:59.920
{\an8}BUT HER AT THE SAME TIME.

39:00.004 --> 39:00.963
{\an8}- THEN DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.965
{\an8}- YOU SELFISH [bleep]!

39:03.049 --> 39:04.508
{\an8}YOU DON'T REALIZE

39:04.592 --> 39:06.177
{\an8}WHEN, OBVIOUSLY, I'M HURTING,
I'M STILL THERE, YOU [bleep].

39:06.260 --> 39:07.428
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU DON'T STRING ME ALONG.

39:07.511 --> 39:10.181
{\an8}- I DIDN'T [bleep] STRING YOU--
- YES, YOU DID.

39:10.264 --> 39:12.600
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD,
THEN DON'T BE WITH ME, BRO,

39:12.683 --> 39:15.227
{\an8}IF YOU'RE [bleep] THAT BLIND!
- I AM BLIND. I AM BLIND.

39:15.311 --> 39:16.937
{\an8}- I SHOULD HAVE CUT YOU.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.607
{\an8}DO IT, THEN. DO IT.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.317
{\an8}- I SHOULD HAVE CUT YOU
FROM DAY ONE.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.069
{\an8}- MAKE UP YOUR MIND, BRO.
MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.195
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT, RON,

39:24.278 --> 39:26.405
{\an8}ME AND YOU ARE NOT
MEANT TO BE.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.783
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU STRUNG ME ALONG TONIGHT.

39:28.866 --> 39:29.658
{\an8}- NO, I DIDN'T.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.494
{\an8}- YOU MADE ME THINK
EVERYTHING WAS--

39:31.577 --> 39:34.580
{\an8}THIS IS YOUR CHANCE RIGHT NOW.
- HONESTLY, YOU'RE WRONG.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.082
{\an8}- WALK AWAY. WALK AWAY.
- YOU'RE WRONG. YOU'RE WRONG.

39:36.165 --> 39:40.002
{\an8}- BYE-BYE. BYE-BYE.

39:40.086 --> 39:40.377
{\an8}BYE-BYE.

39:50.262 --> 39:52.556
{\an8}- RON'S A LIAR,
AND HE KEEPS LYING.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.016
{\an8}AND I KEEP CATCHING HIM
IN LIES.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.936
{\an8}IT FINALLY HIT ME, LIKE,

39:57.019 --> 40:00.439
