00:02.080 --> 00:03.920
Previously on The Shield:

00:04.120 --> 00:07.120
I'll shoot, man. I swear, I'll shoot.
Are you deaf?

00:09.440 --> 00:11.720
- Go ahead.
- I said, I'll shoot you!

00:11.920 --> 00:13.400
Shoot!

00:15.640 --> 00:17.840
Did you wanna get shot?

00:18.320 --> 00:21.320
- Julien, did you wanna die?
- You have no idea.

00:21.480 --> 00:27.200
You're gay. Okay? I'm your partner.
I know it's not worth dying for.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.960
Terry here is losing his cherry.
He's coming with us.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.720
Congratulations, man.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.280
My guys tipped you off that Terry
was looking to take you down.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.360
Ben, the bust just went bad.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.840
My source at Justice
is all over my ass.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.600
He wants to know if you made us
accomplices to a murder.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.760
- Cops investigated for stealing drugs?
- I was sick when I saw that.

00:45.960 --> 00:49.200
- Do you have any idea how it got out?
- Yeah, you leaked it.

00:49.400 --> 00:54.600
I'm tired. I can't keep explaining these
messes or cleaning up after them.

00:54.760 --> 00:57.960
- Ben.
- No, I can't have your back anymore.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.440
I thought I owed it to you to tell you.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:47.560 --> 01:50.640
- Let's go! On the ground!
- Get down!

01:50.800 --> 01:51.880
Police! Down!

01:52.080 --> 01:54.720
Cethru, how many times
do I gotta tell you?

01:54.880 --> 01:57.680
Firearms and alcohol
are a dangerous combination.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.920
- See?
- Get down on your knees.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.760
I said, get down on your knees.

02:09.840 --> 02:13.720
Cethru is upgrading his merch.
Some of these might actually shoot.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.760
Hey, Vic.

02:18.840 --> 02:22.160
- Wishing your cock was that big?
- Man, these are beautiful animals.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.880
I can't believe they just let them
rip each other apart.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.760
- Just dumb birds, brother.
- Where they taking them, man?

02:27.920 --> 02:31.640
- Three little letters: KFC.
- Come on, those are my best birds.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.680
- Shut up. Move.
- Wait. Come on. I can help you, man.

02:34.880 --> 02:40.320
Cethru's smalltime. You want guns,
I'll hook you up with the big guy.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.120
Yeah? Who we talking about?

02:47.280 --> 02:49.520
Listen, call off the butchers,
and I'll tell you.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.880
Why don't you tell me first.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.120
Pazi Arombula.
Is that big enough for you?

02:56.640 --> 02:58.440
- You know where Pazi is?
- He loves birds.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.760
- He's in town for Dos Días de Sangre.
- Two Days of Blood?

03:01.960 --> 03:07.120
It's a big summer cockfight, all right?
I get you inside. You get Pazi.

03:07.320 --> 03:11.280
Last I heard, those pits were filled
with Filipinos and Mexicans.

03:11.480 --> 03:15.240
I get some of my best fighters
from rednecks in Louisiana.

03:15.400 --> 03:19.000
- He'll blend right in.
- Blow me, chicken man.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.200
Pazi Arombula, huh? He is bigtime.

03:23.360 --> 03:25.520
I'll tell you when and where.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.920
Check it out. Is it all there?

03:35.640 --> 03:37.400
We're cool, man.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.400
Here.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.520
Tony!

03:52.880 --> 03:54.680
Stop!

03:56.520 --> 03:58.480
Tony!

03:59.560 --> 04:01.600
Pazi's a gunrunning scumbag,
who's wanted...

04:01.760 --> 04:04.120
...by Mexican, federal, state
and local authorities.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.880
He's got close to a 3 million-peso
bounty on his head.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.240
Three million? Let me see that.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.440
Oh, Vic, you gotta let me go undercover
and clean up this grease stain.

04:14.600 --> 04:18.120
Last time I let you go undercover,
you got beaten up by a stripper.

04:18.320 --> 04:22.320
I was jumped by her thug boyfriend,
and she was a dancer.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.240
Shut up!

04:28.280 --> 04:30.360
Vic, you got a minute?

04:32.040 --> 04:33.960
Yeah, sure.

04:40.600 --> 04:45.360
I'm surprised to see you. What's up?

04:45.520 --> 04:49.720
- You and I, we've had a rough year.
- Yeah, we did.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.760
One rough year out of 20 years
of friendship. That ain't bad.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.640
With those percentages,
I'd still be with my first wife.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.960
- You're better off with Nancy.
- I know.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.920
- What's up, Ben?
- I was in a hit-and-run tonight.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.880
I think I killed the guy.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.600
- You didn't stop?
- I got out to check on him...

05:17.760 --> 05:20.240
...and his gangbanger buddy
took some shots at me.

05:20.400 --> 05:24.640
I panicked and hightailed it.
Oh, man, what am I gonna do?

05:24.800 --> 05:30.160
- Tell the truth. If he took shots at you...
- Vic, I been DUI four times.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.480
I got it hushed up.

05:32.680 --> 05:37.240
Word gets out that I killed this guy,
nobody's gonna believe I wasn't drunk.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.800
- Oh, Christ, Ben.
- Imagine me in prison, Vic.

05:41.560 --> 05:45.440
Now, I know as rough
as we left it last time...

05:45.960 --> 05:48.600
...you can't want that. Right?

05:51.800 --> 05:53.440
Can you help an old friend?

06:06.640 --> 06:10.400
Ben, give me the keys. Shane, tell
Suvani repairing this blue Mercedes...

06:10.560 --> 06:13.440
...is top-priority and top-secret.
I want it good as new by tomorrow.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.360
- Right, boss.
- Lem, get Ben home.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.160
- Okay.
- I'll find out who's on the case...

06:17.320 --> 06:18.840
...make sure it never hits you.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.800
Thanks, Vic.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.320
It was some slide.
Impact dragged him 75 feet.

06:30.760 --> 06:34.680
- Maybe you ought to call Guinness.
- No, record's over 30 miles.

06:34.840 --> 06:39.640
This isn't even a footnote.
Anthony Nuñez, dealer extraordinaire.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.640
Witnesses say he and a friend
worked the corner over there.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.640
- Where's the friend?
- Didn't stick around.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.320
- What about the car?
- It's a blue Mercedes, four-door.

06:49.480 --> 06:54.480
Witness was vague. Guy driving, little
Latin number in the passenger seat.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.880
High-end sedan. If it wasn't tricked-out,
he didn't live around here.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.720
He must've been
in a hurry to get home.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.080
I'm having trouble. Do you know
how to run this program?

07:06.680 --> 07:10.680
- Are you doing okay?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.120
If you're not ready to go back out,
I understand.

07:13.320 --> 07:18.160
No, really. I'm okay. It was just
a one-time thing. I'm fine now.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.320
You sure?

07:20.480 --> 07:24.440
I know you're worried because you
have to ride with me, but I'm okay.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.440
- Yeah, well, it's my life too, you know?
- I know.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.760
So say something
that will make me feel better.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.880
- I'm not gonna hang you out.
- And?

07:37.360 --> 07:40.440
And I'm gonna speak with my reverend,
sort through things.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.360
But my head is in it 100 percent.

07:50.400 --> 07:54.080
I heard you guys scraped a
dope-dealing banger off the pavement.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.640
- Not pretty.
- Crash-test dummy got an ID?

07:57.360 --> 07:59.400
- Claudette, can I borrow you?
- What for?

07:59.600 --> 08:03.160
- A double homicide in the Grove.
- Some morning.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.960
You need me? I can pass
the hit-and-run off to Walt.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.120
Just Claudette.
I'm going over there too.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.400
It looks like it could be
a messy situation.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.960
Come on, we'll ride together.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.720
- I'm still waiting.
- Yeah.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.800
Victim's name's Anthony Nuñez.
You know him?

08:20.960 --> 08:24.600
Oh, after summer vacation
was over, we stopped writing.

08:25.240 --> 08:29.280
That area, he's probably a Toro.
Anything on the driver?

08:29.440 --> 08:33.880
White guy, blue Mercedes, señorita
in the passenger seat. That's it.

08:34.039 --> 08:36.679
- There was a passenger.
- Good news is, neighbours have seen...

08:36.840 --> 08:41.000
...the car parked in the area at night.
Sounds like a little love tryst to me.

08:44.560 --> 08:47.560
Toros do this thing
called a toss-and-shoot.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.280
- What's that?
- Toss a rival banger in front of a car.

08:50.480 --> 08:55.200
They fire off a few rounds. Scare the
driver, make it look like a hit-and-run.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.000
Maybe the driver killed the guy,
didn't wanna get caught?

08:58.200 --> 09:00.320
Why don't you let me
give you a hand with this.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.320
You wanna help me?

09:02.680 --> 09:06.880
Ever since you rolled that serial killer,
you're the man around here.

09:07.040 --> 09:12.080
- Right.
- C-note says this is a toss-and-shoot.

09:20.680 --> 09:24.440
- Gonna tell us what's going on?
- Can I have your attention, please?

09:24.640 --> 09:27.960
Now, people, please. Please, please.
We need you to listen.

09:28.160 --> 09:31.040
Give us some time to go inside
and determine what happened.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.360
We'll make an announcement
when we know something.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.560
Sweet Jesus. What's burning?

09:47.720 --> 09:49.880
It's the garbage disposal.
The motor burned out.

09:50.440 --> 09:53.880
It looks like they were killed
with a meat tenderiser.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.440
Killer panicked,
tried to dispose of the body.

09:56.640 --> 10:01.960
The victim in the sink is Tanya Kramer.
The other is Violet Roosevelt.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.960
- Any witnesses?
- Well, the walls here are pretty thin.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.120
A lot of people heard the screams.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.440
- Captain.
- Yes?

10:09.600 --> 10:12.400
There's someone downstairs
who can identify the killer.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.840
Down there.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.240
- Karen Mitchell?
- You know her?

10:22.400 --> 10:25.560
Yeah, I met her a few times
during Morgan's re-election campaign.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.640
- Karen, hello.
- David.

10:29.800 --> 10:33.200
- Councilman Morgan couldn't make it?
- He's in Sacramento moving.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.600
- He asked me to come and be his eyes.
- Of course.

10:36.760 --> 10:41.920
- So if you need anything, just ask.
- Well, I appreciate his help, yours too.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.840
This is Maya Duffy. She saw the killer.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.400
- Can you describe him?
- His name's Wally Forton.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.080
White guy. He was dating
Tanya's daughter.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.360
- What happened?
- What happened is, they called 911...

10:53.520 --> 10:56.200
...and it took you
over an hour to show up.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.040
- Over an hour. Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.960
We heard Tanya up there screaming
at Wally. She called 911.

11:03.160 --> 11:06.480
- And he didn't leave?
- No, he went outside...

11:06.640 --> 11:10.840
...waiting around for 20 minutes or so,
and then he went back and killed them.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.560
- An hour. Can that be right?
- I'll have to review the 911 tapes.

11:14.720 --> 11:18.960
If it was a black man breaking in,
it wouldn't take no hour.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.600
Everybody gets equal treatment
from this department.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.960
Why are they dead, then?

11:24.120 --> 11:27.440
Ma'am, come with me, please.
I'll take the statement.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.320
- Go by the car.
- Whatever.

11:29.480 --> 11:33.600
They'll want answers, and frankly,
I think they deserve them.

11:35.840 --> 11:41.960
Wally's girlfriend might be in danger.
We need to find him, her or both.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.320
I pulled the dead guy's known
associates. Recognise anyone?

11:51.080 --> 11:54.360
That's the guy's buddy right there.
He's the one that shot at me.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.720
Jesus Rosales. Yeah, he's a Toro.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.840
Warrants for possession and intent
to sell narcotics. No wonder he ran.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.600
- Can you find him?
- Who are you talking to here?

12:04.760 --> 12:09.000
He got a good look at me. What if he
decides I'm his bargaining chip?

12:09.160 --> 12:11.040
We'll make him a better deal.

12:14.880 --> 12:18.760
So when were you gonna tell me
you were shagging a Latina?

12:21.000 --> 12:25.960
- I didn't wanna get her involved.
- She couldn't be more involved.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.480
- Was she driving?
- No, it happened just like I said...

12:29.640 --> 12:31.600
...except she was with me.
- Who is she?

12:31.760 --> 12:36.720
Sedona Tellez. I've been seeing her.

12:36.920 --> 12:40.320
- What about Nancy?
- We're all perfect?

12:41.000 --> 12:44.200
Dutchboy's picked up her scent.
You're gonna have to send her away.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.040
Okay. Good idea.

12:47.200 --> 12:51.520
Hey, Vic, she's not just some lay.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.120
I love her.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.680
Melissa left for the gym
about two hours ago.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.640
- Was she alone?
- Yeah.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.880
What about the boyfriend, Wally?
Have you seen him?

13:03.040 --> 13:07.480
Wally. Oh, honey,
he's a cutie-pie for a white guy.

13:07.680 --> 13:11.000
- You know him?
- Sort of. I hear them some nights.

13:11.680 --> 13:15.160
- Hear them?
- Doing it. Honey, he's a screamer.

13:15.320 --> 13:18.720
He's louder than she is. I thought
they split up, but I guess not.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.800
- You know where we might find them?
- He came back about an hour ago...

13:21.960 --> 13:24.880
...Iooking for her.
I told him that she was at the gym.

13:28.800 --> 13:33.800
Hey, our road kill pissed off a couple
of Los Mags a couple of days back.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.000
It's looking more and more
like banger payback.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.040
I found her.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.240
- Who?
- The mystery woman.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.560
I talked to a pizza delivery guy.
He's seen a blue Benz...

13:43.720 --> 13:49.320
...on numerous occasions
at 2538 Mercado Avenue.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.560
Sedona Tellez. She's our babe.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.920
- What are we waiting for? Let's go.
- There's no one home.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.200
But a neighbour swears
she jumped into a cab...

13:58.360 --> 14:00.800
...with a bunch of suitcases
earlier this afternoon.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.600
This is starting to get interesting.

14:02.760 --> 14:06.440
Who knows if it's even the same Benz?
Maybe she just went on vacation.

14:06.600 --> 14:12.080
Or she and the boyfriend skipped town.
Don't worry, I'll get them.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.960
Cool.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.760
Pazi's a badass with connections
to half a dozen gangs.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.680
Why are you risking your life
to get off a misdemeanour?

14:19.840 --> 14:24.160
Those cocks, I hatched them myself.
I raised them. They're all I got.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.920
Okay. You get me in, set up a meeting.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.280
Tell Pazi I'm willing to trade
feathers for hardware.

14:31.440 --> 14:35.400
Trust me, if Pazi likes your chickens,
he'll trade anything to get them.

14:35.560 --> 14:38.760
Good. So we got a plan, right?

14:38.920 --> 14:40.880
Can I go home now? Am I free?

14:41.040 --> 14:44.600
Let's just say that you're on parole
till this thing gets done. Understand?

14:44.800 --> 14:47.520
Yeah, okay. Let's go to my yard,
and I'll teach you...

14:47.680 --> 14:49.400
...everything you need
to know in the ring.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.920
- Bottled water?
- The most important part of their diet.

14:56.120 --> 14:59.520
- The poison out of my tap will kill them.
- I hear that, man.

14:59.680 --> 15:03.720
- What kind of bird is he?
- Kelso, champion line. Never been cut.

15:03.880 --> 15:06.760
Those three are Boston Roundheads,
the Solabina...

15:06.920 --> 15:08.720
...and the blinker's a Johnny Jumper.

15:09.440 --> 15:11.680
- Blinker?
- Blinker.

15:11.840 --> 15:14.000
Oh, man, that's sick.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.200
Hey, you got till tonight, man.
Learn as much as you can.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.440
Pazi's gonna wanna know
how you raise these birds.

15:19.640 --> 15:23.760
Jesus. B12, vitamin K supplements.
They need all this stuff?

15:23.960 --> 15:26.400
- If you want them to win.
- What's his name?

15:26.600 --> 15:29.320
It hurts too much.
I stopped naming them.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.840
They're all called nugget.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.160
That's not funny, dude.
I mean, these are innocent creatures.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.040
They are kind of beautiful,
though, aren't they?

15:39.240 --> 15:41.560
I mean, in a snack food sort of way.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.520
Jesus.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.520
- Open warrant. Let's make this easy.
- He didn't do anything.

15:59.680 --> 16:02.640
Look, kids, I'm in no mood to play.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.840
Come on.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.800
- Where you going, homes?
- Back off. I'm a cop. Back off.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.920
If this was a real arrest, you would
have brought more. Let him go.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.560
- He'll be out in 12 hours.
- I say he's out now.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.560
Don't do it. It's not worth it.

16:18.320 --> 16:21.480
I don't wanna shoot anybody today.
That's up to you.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.120
- Gonna kill us all, ése?
- No, just the one who wants it first.

16:25.280 --> 16:30.120
Hey! Get your hands in the air!
Back off! Back off.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.440
Walk. Come on.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.880
The witness at Melissa's gym
saw them leaving together.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.160
- By force or willingly?
- The guy wasn't sure.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.440
Karen Mitchell's here.
She's only gonna get in our way.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.440
You could talk to her.
Tell her to back off.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.000
- Me?
- You said you met her a few times.

17:04.079 --> 17:08.400
You know, rumour is, she's Morgan's
handpicked successor for his seat.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.599
- Really.
- Which means that she would be...

17:10.760 --> 17:14.040
...running against you in the primary,
but you knew that.

17:14.240 --> 17:18.400
As wedge issues go,
two dead women is a bad one.

17:18.599 --> 17:20.640
You wanna catch the killer
and cover your ass...

17:20.800 --> 17:24.400
...but if you can't do both,
this is about catching the killer.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.160
Karen.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.800
I was hoping you had
some new information by now.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.320
Unfortunately, no.

17:31.480 --> 17:34.440
- Well, what about the 911 tapes?
- They're on the way.

17:34.640 --> 17:38.000
We've been trying to find Melissa
Kramer before she gets her own tape.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.760
Well, I'd like to listen to them with you.

17:43.160 --> 17:47.360
Two women are dead, David.
I hope we're not playing politics here.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.840
Jesus, we need your help
with something.

17:53.040 --> 17:57.640
Now, we're sorry about your friend,
but that was an accident.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.000
You dragged him halfway
down the block.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.920
I saw your rap sheets.
You and your friend are no saints.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.160
- Jesus, you know who we are?
- Cops.

18:09.360 --> 18:13.600
No, we're not just any cops.
We're good friends to have, Jesus.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.720
You ever get picked up for selling rock,
we're the guys to know.

18:16.880 --> 18:20.640
- Yeah, if I keep quiet.
- If you keep quiet.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.200
- Okay.
- Good.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.960
You just made a smart decision.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.480
I'll tell you what, Jesus.
I'm gonna write down a number.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.640
You get scooped up,
you call me anytime...

18:37.800 --> 18:39.840
Jesus Christ!

18:42.000 --> 18:44.040
What did you do?!

18:47.440 --> 18:49.720
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- I had to.

18:49.880 --> 18:54.120
- Put the gun down, Ben.
- Relax, Vic.

18:54.280 --> 18:56.880
- We don't have to worry now.
- He was cooperating.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.800
- I was supposed to trust him?!
- He was innocent!

18:59.000 --> 19:00.760
- He was a problem!
- Jesus Christ, Ben!

19:01.280 --> 19:03.560
What did you do?

19:05.600 --> 19:08.280
Nothing you haven't done.

19:08.560 --> 19:12.720
- What?
- Terry Crowley. Any bells ringing?

19:13.320 --> 19:16.760
You don't wanna say it, fine.
But I helped you get clear on that.

19:16.960 --> 19:21.320
- Oh, man, this is your problem.
- It's our problem.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.680
- No.
- His buddies saw you take this guy.

19:24.880 --> 19:28.200
Now he's dead.
I picked you for a reason, Vic.

19:28.360 --> 19:32.840
You've been through this.
Now help me get clear.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.840
I appreciate this, Vic.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Drop this guy in Los Mags territory
and make it look like a gang hit.

19:49.160 --> 19:51.800
That's smart. Yeah.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.760
When this lands on your desk,
just bury it.

19:56.520 --> 20:00.520
Hey, look, Vic, I'm sorry
about how this went down. I am.

20:00.680 --> 20:04.000
Now just keep Dutch off my ass,
and we're home free.

20:06.160 --> 20:10.520
Vic, you and me. We're good, right?

20:14.600 --> 20:18.440
No, not today.
That's two for 25 right there, pops.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.400
That phone is 10 bucks. No problem.
Got change for everything.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.160
- What can I do for you officers?
- Got a complaint about your yard sale.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.800
- What kind of complaint?
- You've been robbing neighbours...

20:30.960 --> 20:33.600
...and forcing them to buy
their property back.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.360
Well, that's a lie.
All this here, this is all mine.

20:36.520 --> 20:39.440
- The person said differently.
- Oh, yeah? And who was that?

20:39.600 --> 20:42.560
They didn't give their name.
They said everyone's scared of you.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.640
- You got any proof this stuff is yours?
- You got any proof that it ain't?

20:48.480 --> 20:51.440
Look, officers, I'm just trying
to have a yard sale here, okay?

20:51.640 --> 20:55.160
- There's nothing illegal about that.
- There is if you don't have a permit.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.600
City-approved. Please believe it.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.240
- Dookie?
- That's me.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.360
Does any of this merchandise
belong to any of you?

21:07.520 --> 21:10.360
If you speak up,
you'll get your stuff back.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.800
If you guys are all done,
I've got business to attend to.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.880
I'm gonna be keeping
my eye out on you, Dookie.

21:21.040 --> 21:25.120
Stop by anytime.
I got great bargains for you two.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.240
Watch it, pops. You touch, you buy.
You know the rules.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.520
What, are you kidding me?
That's 10 percent.

21:31.680 --> 21:37.800
I only get 20 percent, Einstein.
Ten percent is half my fee.

21:39.040 --> 21:42.000
- You sure about that?
- Hey.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.520
Lem, this is Jojo Rizal.
He's a bounty hunter.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.800
- Bail enforcement agent.
- Curtis Lemansky.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.080
Jojo here's gonna help us
with this Pazi deal.

21:49.280 --> 21:52.440
- Help us?
- Yeah, like a piece of Pazi's bounty?

21:52.640 --> 21:54.160
Cops can't collect bounty, dude.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.320
I figured a way around
that little problem.

21:56.480 --> 22:01.080
- What, the problem of us being cops?
- Bring me Pazi, I split my fee 50-50.

22:01.280 --> 22:04.360
- No way.
- Come on. That's like 400,000 pesos.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.640
That's gotta be, what?
A couple hundred grand?

22:06.800 --> 22:08.720
- Try 50?
- Fifty?

22:09.400 --> 22:12.040
- That's about right.
- Damn, Mexico.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.160
- You know what? It's still worth it.
- No way. Forget it, man.

22:15.320 --> 22:17.600
- Okay.
- Hold on. Hold on one second.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.400
- What?
- I'm looking out for our interests.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.960
Jesus. For once, can't we just do
what we're supposed to and then stop?

22:23.120 --> 22:26.360
Hey, when you guys figure out
who's wearing the pants...

22:26.520 --> 22:30.400
...why don't you beep me.
Oh, your cock's out.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.640
Damn it.

22:35.920 --> 22:39.440
Is that who you see yourself as?
A gay man?

22:39.600 --> 22:46.000
Of course not, I'm just confused.
These urges, I can't beat them down.

22:46.880 --> 22:51.440
So, what I'm hearing is,
you really wanna change.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.280
That's why I'm here.

22:54.760 --> 22:57.480
I was ashamed.
I didn't know what you'd say.

22:57.680 --> 23:02.120
What's important is your commitment
to God, to your faith.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.200
I know.

23:05.240 --> 23:08.000
So, what can I do?

23:11.240 --> 23:14.880
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

23:20.280 --> 23:24.440
Vic, I researched our missing
femme fatale, Sedona Tellez.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.400
Waste of time, Dutchboy.
Taggers found the victim's amigo...

23:27.560 --> 23:30.280
...dead in a Los Mag tunnel.
Told you, gang hit all the way.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.880
- What buddy? Jesus Rosales?
- Yeah.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.880
- I've been looking for him.
- Well, stop.

23:37.040 --> 23:42.480
Girlfriend bolts, friend gets hit.
There's something else at play here.

23:42.640 --> 23:47.120
- What?
- Sedona Tellez is listed as a CEO...

23:47.280 --> 23:49.480
...of a corporation based
in the Cayman Islands.

23:49.680 --> 23:54.440
Its sole purpose? Buying up
real estate right here in Farmington.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.520
- You're kidding.
- Nope. Not bad for an accountant...

23:57.720 --> 23:59.640
...living in a one-bedroom
in slum town.

23:59.800 --> 24:03.400
- Now this Jesus is dead?
- Yeah.

24:03.560 --> 24:08.680
He was a Toro. I'll start with his crew.
Usually runs with five, six other guys.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.360
- How do you know that?
- I have contacts.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.480
- You do?
- Believe it or not.

24:13.640 --> 24:17.000
- You found all this out since 4:00?
- Pretty good, huh?

24:17.200 --> 24:20.200
- Too good, Dutchboy.
- Well, I have a rep to maintain.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.040
You're gonna put me right out of a job.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.680
One, two, three.

24:31.080 --> 24:33.880
Let's go. Come on, come on, birdie, go.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.280
Go, birdie, go. Go! Take him down!

24:41.360 --> 24:43.520
Go, take him down!
Take him down, birdie!

24:58.960 --> 25:01.440
What about it?
Who's ready for round two?

25:04.560 --> 25:07.040
- What a badass!
- What, you saw Pazi?

25:07.200 --> 25:11.320
No, man, Frank. He gets in there,
and it's like he's possessed.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.280
This goddamn cock won 700 bucks.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.160
- You named him?
- Frank.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.080
- What? It's just a first name.
- Pazi was a no-show?

25:18.240 --> 25:21.480
Yeah. Yeah. Gabo heard he's coming
tomorrow. You ready for round two?

25:21.640 --> 25:23.520
You're sick, man.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.360
Where's the police? Where are you?

25:25.520 --> 25:27.560
Try to remain calm.
The police are coming.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.360
<i>- He's back again!
- Now!</i>

25:29.560 --> 25:31.200
<i>- Who's back?
- Wally Forton.</i>

25:31.360 --> 25:33.960
At this point, it's been 47
minutes since the initial call.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.720
- Jesus Christ.
- Somebody help us!

25:35.920 --> 25:37.440
<i>- Ma'am?
- Unbelievable.</i>

25:37.800 --> 25:39.760
- Help us!
- Mrs. Kramer...?

25:39.920 --> 25:42.240
- Help!
- Are you still there?

25:42.400 --> 25:45.000
<i>- Bitch, you did this!
- Mrs. Kramer, are you okay?</i>

25:45.160 --> 25:47.200
Help us!

25:47.680 --> 25:49.680
How does something like this happen?

25:49.840 --> 25:52.400
It's a manpower issue.
We only had two units assigned.

25:52.560 --> 25:56.080
One was responding to a heart attack.
The other was involved in a pursuit.

25:56.760 --> 25:59.400
- Why only two units?
- It's a new policy.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.560
Saturating areas with more patrols.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.600
- While other areas go unprotected?
- Not unprotected.

26:04.800 --> 26:08.120
Statistically, it's smart policing.
A larger concentration of units...

26:08.320 --> 26:10.840
...in one area reduces crime
by 65 percent...

26:14.520 --> 26:16.520
You believe that?

26:17.200 --> 26:18.800
What happened today was an anomaly.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.320
Tell that to the family
of those two dead women.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.040
Usually, there's adequate backup.

26:24.240 --> 26:27.880
David has the discretion
on how his units are assigned.

26:30.480 --> 26:33.480
So you're the one who's responsible?

26:35.960 --> 26:38.720
- You're blaming me for this?
- Payback's a bitch, huh?

26:38.880 --> 26:42.200
- Thanks for tossing me a softball.
- This policy's your idea.

26:42.360 --> 26:45.040
It's been in place for six months.
You had no problem with it...

26:45.200 --> 26:47.920
...as long as you were sending the
patrols to Latino neighbourhoods.

26:48.080 --> 26:51.320
- Wait a minute. This is not my mess.
- It is now.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.120
So you better fix it.

27:01.760 --> 27:04.280
- Vic, good to see you again.
- Business as usual, huh?

27:04.480 --> 27:06.720
For the both of us.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.040
Julien, I need a hand.

27:33.120 --> 27:37.120
- I need your help with something.
- I'm done helping you.

27:37.280 --> 27:40.640
Hey, I keep your secret every day,
just like I promised, right?

27:40.800 --> 27:43.520
Every time you need something,
you'll twist a screw?

27:43.680 --> 27:45.720
You're gonna help me
with something right now...

27:45.880 --> 27:48.800
...or you're gonna see
just how hard I can twist.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.960
This guy walks into the middle
of you and your friends...

27:52.120 --> 27:54.280
...pulls a gun and walks off with Jesus?

27:54.440 --> 27:57.160
- Yeah.
- Any idea who he is?

27:57.320 --> 27:59.200
- Detective.
- Yeah?

27:59.400 --> 28:01.520
- You're needed.
- I'm in the middle of something.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.400
Captain said it was important.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.720
I'll be right back.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.320
- Where is he?
- I didn't talk to him.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.840
I just had the message passed to me.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.880
You listen and you listen quick.
Los Mags pulled your guy out.

28:28.080 --> 28:31.480
You ID me, you'll be stone dead
15 minutes after you leave this station.

28:31.640 --> 28:33.560
You hear me?

28:34.720 --> 28:36.000
- Hey.
- Vic.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.960
Thought I'd sit in.
Hope you don't mind.

28:38.160 --> 28:42.440
Not at all. Anyway, you were
about to describe the guy.

28:46.080 --> 28:48.440
Well, answer the man.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.840
I didn't get a good look.

28:54.280 --> 28:56.400
What did you see?

28:58.760 --> 29:02.240
- He was wearing Los Mags colours.
- Los Mags?

29:05.200 --> 29:07.360
A goddamn gang hit.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.520
I told you it was boys in the 'hood.

29:13.680 --> 29:17.000
He couldn't look you or me in the eye.
Kept scratching the top of his right...

29:17.160 --> 29:19.200
- Wagenbach, stop.
- He's lying.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.600
- A skin allergy means he's lying?
- He's covering for the Benz guy.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.720
I can't believe this. Give it up already.

29:24.880 --> 29:27.800
Even if you're right,
the driver is still a witness to a murder.

29:27.960 --> 29:31.240
- I still have to find him, so let me.
- You don't need the witness.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.840
Vic, follow up your gang lead.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.680
I'm gonna track down the driver and his
señorita's Cayman Island connection.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.720
Or is that gang related too?

29:40.520 --> 29:42.800
Add units seven, eight and 10.
I don't want to...

29:42.960 --> 29:44.800
...spit in the Grove without
hitting a police car.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.920
- Put the Riot Squad on tactical alert.
- We found Melissa Kramer.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.600
Where?

29:50.840 --> 29:53.040
- You think she's in on it?
- I don't know.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.120
Let's hope she's not down the disposal.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.440
Forton brought
the woman here two hours ago.

29:57.600 --> 30:00.200
They're in Room 19.
He had a bottle of champagne.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.440
- To celebrate?
- Or to tenderise.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.720
Police, freeze! Get your hands
where I can see them!

30:12.920 --> 30:16.080
Oh, my God! Wait!
What did we do?!

30:16.240 --> 30:18.880
- Wally Forton, you're under arrest...
- Stop it!

30:19.040 --> 30:21.280
...for the murders of Violet Roosevelt
and Tanya Kramer.

30:23.440 --> 30:27.640
- Murder? Wait a minute. What? Wally?
- They were just getting between us.

30:28.800 --> 30:31.680
Read him his rights. Twice.

30:31.880 --> 30:35.240
We're forever, baby. Forever!

30:36.640 --> 30:38.560
They're dead?

30:49.960 --> 30:52.320
- Caught the guy, huh?
- Yeah.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.480
Nasty business
down there in the Grove.

30:54.640 --> 30:58.200
Is that a joke?
Well, tell Gilroy I'm not laughing.

30:58.360 --> 31:01.720
- What are you talking about?
- Like you don't know.

31:01.880 --> 31:04.360
Pretend I don't.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.800
Gilroy's diverted manpower
to other neighbourhoods.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.760
Crime went down everywhere,
except the Grove.

31:08.960 --> 31:12.360
Now he's letting me swing for
the department on these two murders.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.280
- Well, I didn't know.
- Well, now you do.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.560
Tell me something.

31:20.120 --> 31:23.720
What would be in it for someone
to buy up property in the Grove?

31:23.880 --> 31:27.040
- Is this a real question?
- Pretend it is.

31:27.240 --> 31:31.840
Well, that area's been ignored.
Crime's up. Land's cheap.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.840
Other than that,
there's no reason to buy there.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.840
- Why? Who's buying up land?
- No one. I'm just asking.

31:39.520 --> 31:42.720
Did Gilroy say something?
I saw the two of you.

31:43.200 --> 31:47.360
No, it's just a stupid idea.
If I get a good one, I'll let you know.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.720
I was inflicted with homosexual urges
just like you.

31:53.920 --> 31:56.160
I was tested constantly.

31:56.320 --> 32:01.120
I used to think that I was gay,
that I had no other choice.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.840
I even cursed God for doing it to me.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.600
You ever heard of sexual-reorientation
therapy, Julien?

32:08.520 --> 32:10.120
I read an article about it once.

32:10.280 --> 32:15.160
Homosexuality is a disease
similar to alcoholism or drug addition.

32:15.360 --> 32:19.000
The church offers programs
to combat these compulsions.

32:19.160 --> 32:23.960
Through discipline, treatment, the
urges can be suppressed, eliminated.

32:24.120 --> 32:26.440
- Really?
- I'm married to a beautiful woman.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.080
I have a child on the way...

32:28.240 --> 32:32.240
...and my wife and I both lead
a fulfilling, spiritual life.

32:32.960 --> 32:35.280
- Is it that simple?
- No.

32:35.440 --> 32:39.680
It takes hard work,
commitment, God's help.

32:39.840 --> 32:46.280
- But I'm finally happy.
- Really a matter of what you wanna do.

32:47.920 --> 32:52.600
- I don't wanna feel like dying.
- Jesus wants you to live, Julien.

32:54.440 --> 32:58.600
- I'm tired of living like this.
- You don't have to anymore.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.480
Oh, shit. Come on, now.
Come on, man. Come on!

33:03.640 --> 33:06.760
Come on! Come on!
Oh, shit, man. No, no, no.

33:06.960 --> 33:10.480
Come on, man. Grab him right there!

33:10.680 --> 33:13.400
Oh, come on, now. No, no.
Sweet Jesus, just...

33:13.600 --> 33:15.800
Get him right now! Underneath!
Underneath!

33:16.000 --> 33:18.520
No! He doesn't know when he's down!
Get him. Come on!

33:18.680 --> 33:21.240
Sweet Jesus! Come on, get up!

33:39.080 --> 33:41.080
What the hell happened?

33:41.680 --> 33:43.640
You lost, ése.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.040
He's all right, man. I'm telling you.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.200
Hey, Shane, man,
I'd like you to meet Pazi.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.160
Gabo tells me you're interested
in making a trade.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.200
Yeah, that's right.

33:57.480 --> 34:00.120
- He was impressive.
- He's dead.

34:00.280 --> 34:04.400
He is mismatched against that Jumper.
It's how he died that counts, huh?

34:07.640 --> 34:10.840
Hey, man, he died good.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.280
You gonna hook me up
with some firepower?

34:19.480 --> 34:24.360
I need to see your other birds, Gomer.
Then we will talk, huh?

34:25.480 --> 34:27.360
What's your grain mixture?

34:27.520 --> 34:30.239
Sixteen percent protein,
10 percent whole corn...

34:30.400 --> 34:34.520
...and 9 percent scratch grain.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.120
That's good.

34:37.320 --> 34:40.040
- These all you brought with you?
- No, I got more back at the motel.

34:40.199 --> 34:43.960
I got some Polaroids there on the front
seat if you wanna see them.

34:56.480 --> 34:59.200
Hold it! Drop it, drop it! Drop it, ése.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.160
Easy.

35:01.520 --> 35:05.680
Drop it! Man, what are you thinking?
Get your hands where I can see them.

35:08.120 --> 35:09.680
Dude, what are you doing?

35:10.560 --> 35:12.480
I thought chloroform
was supposed to knock them out.

35:12.680 --> 35:14.360
Guess this works better.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.400
We were to wait until he
showed us the guns.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.200
We take this guy in,
his case will be tied up for years.

35:19.600 --> 35:23.040
I say we turn him over to the Mexicans,
where he'll be hung by his balls...

35:23.240 --> 35:25.520
...and we make a few pesos
in the process.

35:25.720 --> 35:29.880
- We were gonna play this one straight.
- How we changed our mind.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.720
If you'll excuse me.

35:50.920 --> 35:53.240
You've been manipulating police
resources...

35:53.400 --> 35:56.200
...to crash land value
in this neighbourhood?

35:56.400 --> 35:59.280
These flats have been
spiralling down for years, Vic.

35:59.440 --> 36:04.040
Your mistress has been buying up
property in this area like she's Disney.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.760
But it's not for her. It's for you.

36:10.160 --> 36:13.680
Two women are dead because
of your little scam.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.280
- And that banger?
- He had it coming.

36:17.440 --> 36:20.160
You're playing violins
for these dope dealers now?

36:20.320 --> 36:21.720
What's phase two?

36:21.880 --> 36:25.000
Send me to clean up the area,
and you sell it off at a profit?

36:25.200 --> 36:27.760
You and your boys
never supplement your income?

36:27.920 --> 36:31.280
Look around, Ben. Where's the good
in what you're doing?

36:35.240 --> 36:37.280
The good is, I'll cut you in.

36:43.720 --> 36:48.200
- Where's your girlfriend?
- Gardner Bungalows, over Sunset.

36:48.360 --> 36:52.080
- Just like the old days, huh?
- When do I start getting my paydays?

36:52.240 --> 36:55.280
Soon. Real soon.

37:04.080 --> 37:07.560
Hasta la vista, amigo. Different kind
of cockfighting where you're headed.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.600
Yeah, you said it.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.560
You lied to me, man. You lied.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.880
I'm not doing anything
the Mack-man wouldn't.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.040
- I'm just branching out.
- You lied to me.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.200
Look, this is 25 G's, brother.

37:22.360 --> 37:25.440
Ten for you, 10 for me and five for Vic
because he's Vic.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.000
- What about Ronnie?
- Screw Ronnie. He's off the clock.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.240
If you don't want it, I'll share it
between me and Vic.

37:30.400 --> 37:34.000
Look, you do this to me again,
I'm gonna kick your redneck ass.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.600
Don't even give me that look, bro.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.920
- I spoke to my reverend.
- Good for you. It helped?

37:42.080 --> 37:45.080
God has a plan for me.
I'm gonna start this program...

37:45.240 --> 37:49.080
...where I'm gonna be taught
how to reconnect with women.

37:49.240 --> 37:53.800
- God's gonna make you straight?
- God's offering me a cure.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.720
It's called sexual-reorientation therapy.
It really works.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.080
You give me back my microwave.
I'm not kidding.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.840
Pump your brakes, all right?
Welfare don't make you special.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
- You got to pay like everybody else.
- I am not scared of you.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.560
- Ma'am, what's the problem?
- He keeps taking our stuff...

38:10.720 --> 38:14.000
...and make us buy it back.
That is my microwave!

38:14.200 --> 38:16.080
- No, it ain't.
- Do you have any proof?

38:16.240 --> 38:21.040
Sure. After he stole it the last time,
I carved my initials on the back.

38:21.240 --> 38:25.080
E.B. That's me. Emily Berry.

38:25.240 --> 38:28.720
Officer, she's lying.
E.B. Stands for excellent buy.

38:28.880 --> 38:32.080
I mark all my best stuff like that.
How about my picture frame, then?

38:32.240 --> 38:35.400
That is not your picture frame,
but you can get it for $10.

38:35.600 --> 38:40.280
If that's your picture frame, how come
that's me and my granddaughter?

38:42.440 --> 38:43.840
Dookie, you wanna turn around?

38:44.000 --> 38:45.720
There's gotta be
some miscommunication...

38:45.880 --> 38:48.280
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Oh, come on, grandma...

38:48.440 --> 38:49.640
...ain't no love for Dookie?

38:49.840 --> 38:51.040
None. Go.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.160
All right, everybody.
Show's over. Come on.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.920
Take what belongs to you
and just go on home.

38:56.080 --> 38:59.600
Hey, come on. That's mine.
That's mine. That's my VCR.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.520
- Come with me.
- What's the matter?

39:05.480 --> 39:08.040
- Someone leaked the 911 tapes.
- Shit.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.720
It's all over the press.
We got a situation brewing.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.840
- Bad?
- When we get there, you do the talking.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.400
Coming from you,
a plea for peace will sound more...

39:16.600 --> 39:18.440
Black.

39:22.200 --> 39:24.720
- What did you get on Gilroy?
- Checked out that hideaway.

39:24.920 --> 39:27.040
- And?
- The mistress never checked in.

39:27.240 --> 39:30.320
- Another lie? What is he doing?
- Maybe he stashed her someplace else.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.840
- Or slashed her someplace else.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.120
- I took Gilroy for a quiet drunk.
- It's the quiet ones you worry about.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.720
He doesn't see a way out.
He just needs to calm down.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.080
If that doesn't work, then what?

39:40.280 --> 39:43.120
He's got you on the same hook
as him for that murder.

39:45.160 --> 39:47.080
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's me. Where are you?

39:47.280 --> 39:49.360
- Still at work.
- Dinner's almost ready.

39:49.560 --> 39:51.760
<i>- I'm gonna have to miss dinner tonight.
- Vic.</i>

39:51.920 --> 39:53.920
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're kidding, right?

39:54.080 --> 39:57.680
- Sweetheart, I can't make it.
- But Ben's already here.

39:58.280 --> 40:01.040
- What?
- Come see the bowl I made in art class.

40:01.240 --> 40:02.840
- Gilroy's there?
- In a second, Cass.

40:03.040 --> 40:05.440
You invite him to dinner,
and you're not gonna show?

40:05.600 --> 40:07.040
- Let me talk to him.
- Corrine!

40:07.640 --> 40:09.720
Hey, buddy,
you gotta stop working so hard.

40:09.880 --> 40:12.920
- What are you doing at my house?
- This case you're on, it's a dead end.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.120
Ben, what are you doing?

40:16.440 --> 40:19.560
- Why did you go looking for that girl?
- Hey, you lied to me.

40:19.720 --> 40:22.960
- Where is she? Is she still alive?
- We were back in business.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.800
- You should have just left it alone.
- I'll leave it alone now, Ben.

40:27.960 --> 40:30.760
- No, you won't, Vic. I know you.
- Come see the bowl I made.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.520
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Ben, this is between you and me.

40:33.680 --> 40:37.720
- You leave my family out of this.
- You should have left Sedona out of it.

40:38.280 --> 40:41.000
- Spend more time with your family, Vic.
- You tell him.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.000
- You'll lose them before you know it.
- Come on.

40:43.200 --> 40:46.800
- You think about what you're doing.
- Here I come, doll.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.040
No! No! Goddamn it!

40:50.200 --> 40:52.920
The sheriffs can get there
faster than we can.

40:57.840 --> 41:01.240
911 for no one
Where were the cops?

41:01.600 --> 41:05.280
911 for no one
Where were the cops?

41:05.440 --> 41:08.400
911 for no one
Where were the cops?

41:08.560 --> 41:12.000
I know you're angry.
This is a serious problem.

41:12.200 --> 41:15.240
- Be no problem in Beverly Hills.
- It won't be a problem here again.

41:15.400 --> 41:18.200
- You have my word.
- Ain't no hour wait in Bel Air.

41:20.480 --> 41:23.880
- We need to resolve this peacefully.
- Detective Wyms is right.

41:24.480 --> 41:27.640
Violence will only undermine
what we need to do here.

41:27.840 --> 41:29.880
- What we need is some new cops.
- What we need...

41:30.040 --> 41:34.080
What we need is a new plan.
One that will protect all of us.

41:41.720 --> 41:44.000
All units, pull back now.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.560
Get the Riot Squad down here.

41:46.760 --> 41:49.240
Get them down here now!

41:53.000 --> 41:56.080
- Are you okay?
- Vic, what's going on? They broke in.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.880
- Where are the kids?
- In here. Why are these sheriffs here?

41:59.040 --> 42:02.360
- Where's Gilroy?
- He left. He said he'd take a rain check.

42:06.600 --> 42:11.640
- Okay. Thanks, fellas. I appreciate it.
- Come on, let's go. I'll walk you out.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.640
Let's go.

42:13.840 --> 42:15.160
Daddy's okay.

42:15.320 --> 42:17.960
Pack bags for you and the kids.
You're not staying here.

42:18.120 --> 42:19.960
- What? This is our house.
- It isn't safe.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.560
- Why not?
- I'll explain it later.

42:21.720 --> 42:25.680
- Explain now! What's going on?
- Corrine, don't ask questions. Do it!

42:26.200 --> 42:28.520
Come on, come on.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.040
He crossed the line, man.

42:32.200 --> 42:33.800
He's done.

42:35.240 --> 42:36.680
- Daddy.
- Hey, hey.

42:36.880 --> 42:40.280
- Where are we going?
- It's okay, sweetie.

42:40.440 --> 42:43.040
We're just gonna take a little trip.

43:11.760 --> 43:16.960
Riot Guard. Let's go. Let's go.
Move. Come on.

43:25.280 --> 43:27.520
Move. Let's move.

43:44.040 --> 43:47.920
Pull back! Everybody pull back!
