WEBVTT

00:05.962 --> 00:07.572
Hey, Dean.
How are you doing?

00:08.704 --> 00:10.488
<i>Had worse.</i>

00:12.055 --> 00:13.404
Hey, Maggie.

00:13.404 --> 00:16.146
I just found
my old varsity jacket.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.148
Of course, you always
wore it more than me.

00:18.148 --> 00:20.237
- This is my husband, Ben.
- Hey.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.804
I do seem to remember
you telling me

00:21.804 --> 00:24.720
that you weren't gonna have
anything to do with him.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.156
<i>What is going on here?</i>

00:26.156 --> 00:27.505
You're dressed like
one of my engineers.

00:27.505 --> 00:30.073
Believe it or not,
we're out of scrubs.

00:30.073 --> 00:32.162
So this is all you're doing?

00:32.162 --> 00:33.294
Just trying to help.

00:33.294 --> 00:36.384
It's nice to have
a guardian angel.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.881
You're here early.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.100
Alarm mishap.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.059
I'm gonna try
to grab some shut-eye

00:59.059 --> 01:00.538
before my shift starts.

01:00.538 --> 01:01.757
Got an empty bed?

01:01.757 --> 01:03.541
Two's open.
I should warn you, though.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.543
Drunk teenager vomited
all over that room last night.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.110
But it's been cleaned.
- Yeah.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.634
Then I won't be surprised
by a pungent whiff.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.114
Thanks for the heads-up.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.578
Dr. Halstead, Maggie,

01:40.578 --> 01:43.494
meet our newest member
of Emergency Medicine.

01:43.494 --> 01:44.669
Justin Lieu.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.149
- Hello.
- Hi. A new attending.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.542
Terrific. Welcome.

01:47.542 --> 01:50.153
Actually, Dr. Lieu
is a first-year resident.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.764
Ah, my mistake.

01:52.764 --> 01:56.203
Listen, I'd like him
to join your service today.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.205
- Sure.
- I'll let you get settled.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.510
Thanks, Ms. Goodwin.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.775
Wondering why I'm so late
to the party?

02:03.775 --> 02:06.778
I know I've got some years
on the typical first-year.

02:06.778 --> 02:09.477
I, uh--I spent a decade
doing search and rescue

02:09.477 --> 02:11.261
before deciding on med school.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.915
- Very cool.
- Hmm.

02:12.915 --> 02:13.959
Is this guy bothering you?

02:13.959 --> 02:16.571
- What are you doing here?
- Yo.

02:16.571 --> 02:17.920
I just remembered
it was your first day,

02:17.920 --> 02:19.443
and I was--you know,
I was in the neighborhood.

02:19.443 --> 02:20.488
What's up, Gallo?

02:20.488 --> 02:22.011
Clearly,
you two know each other.

02:22.011 --> 02:23.578
We have ambo coming in.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.057
Dr. Halstead,
you're going to five.

02:25.057 --> 02:26.494
Mm, ready to get
your hands dirty?

02:26.494 --> 02:28.060
- Yeah. Catch you later?
- Yeah, go.

02:28.060 --> 02:29.584
Go on.
Be useful.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.455
Courtney, going to five.
What do we got?

02:31.455 --> 02:32.978
Lydia Shaw.
15-year-old female.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.632
Disoriented and confused.

02:34.632 --> 02:37.331
GCS 13, BP 90/56.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.463
Sinus tach in the 110s. Afebrile.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.596
Wait.
Where am I?

02:41.596 --> 02:43.511
She woke up this morning,
she couldn't tell me her name,

02:43.511 --> 02:45.077
what day of the week it was.

02:45.077 --> 02:46.296
Nothing.

02:46.296 --> 02:47.863
- Are you Lydia's mom?
- Yes.

02:47.863 --> 02:49.169
Danielle.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.301
On my count.
One, two, three.

02:51.301 --> 02:52.998
She's been complaining
of exhaustion

02:52.998 --> 02:54.304
and nausea for weeks.

02:54.304 --> 02:55.305
Okay, we got her.

02:55.305 --> 02:56.480
Lydia, you're at the hospital.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.699
I'm gonna listen
to your lungs.

03:00.005 --> 03:02.399
OK.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.575
Lungs are clear bilaterally.

03:04.575 --> 03:05.881
Danielle,
does Lydia have

03:05.881 --> 03:07.187
any conditions
we should know about?

03:07.187 --> 03:09.189
Any medications she's on?
- None.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.016
She's never even had the flu.

03:11.016 --> 03:12.279
Dr. Halstead?

03:18.285 --> 03:20.069
OK, pitting edema
to the lower extremities.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.244
What's that?

03:21.244 --> 03:22.680
Just means
there's some swelling.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.855
Stop it!

03:23.855 --> 03:25.422
Why are you doing that?

03:25.422 --> 03:27.032
I'm sorry, Lydia.
I'm just checking your eyes.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.425
Almost done.

03:28.425 --> 03:29.731
Sclera is jaundiced.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.559
Dr. Lieu,
how does the liver feel?

03:31.559 --> 03:33.952
Liver edge extends
past the costal margin.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.305
I know.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.220
All right.
All done.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.527
Let's get a CBC,
CMP, coags,

03:43.527 --> 03:45.877
LFT, chest X-ray,
ammonia level, UA,

03:45.877 --> 03:48.532
and a right upper quadrant ultrasound.

03:48.532 --> 03:50.142
OK, we'll be back
the minute we have an update.

03:50.142 --> 03:52.188
OK.

03:52.188 --> 03:53.363
What are you thinking?

03:53.363 --> 03:55.974
Hepatic encephalopathy.

03:55.974 --> 03:59.369
What, didn't expect the intern
to know the answer?

03:59.369 --> 04:01.066
I was second oldest
in my med school class.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.068
It might have given me
a bit of a complex.

04:03.068 --> 04:05.332
Yeah, well, I think
you're absolutely right.

04:05.332 --> 04:08.422
All clinical signs point
to advanced liver disease

04:08.422 --> 04:10.902
as the cause
of her altered mental state.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.295
But what would cause

04:12.295 --> 04:15.820
an otherwise healthy
15-year-old's liver to fail?

04:20.651 --> 04:22.349
Grabbed this from your locker
for you.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.481
You'll never guess
what's inside.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.004
Tampering
with someone else's mail

04:26.004 --> 04:27.354
is a federal offense, Doris.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.660
Just open it, Maggie.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.672
- No!
- Mm-hmm.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.200
Is he there?

04:48.200 --> 04:50.333
Are you serious?

04:50.333 --> 04:52.422
I can't believe
April kept it from me.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.032
Surprised?

04:54.032 --> 04:56.992
Thrilled.
I'm so happy for you guys.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.430
Thanks, Mags.

05:13.617 --> 05:15.010
Come in.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.664
Uh-oh.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.709
See, now why does
my mere presence

05:18.709 --> 05:20.363
elicit that response
in your doctors?

05:20.363 --> 05:21.886
Take a wild guess.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.845
Have a seat, Dr. Marcel.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.282
You're not in any trouble.
- Oh, good.

05:26.282 --> 05:28.415
Listen, I'm sure you know
the board wanted

05:28.415 --> 05:32.157
to update the OR suites
this year with MRI machines.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.724
Yeah, it'd be
a real gamechanger

05:33.724 --> 05:36.423
to have high-resolution imaging
available during surgery.

05:36.423 --> 05:39.121
Unfortunately,
the supply chain crisis

05:39.121 --> 05:41.341
took precedence
over fundraising efforts.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.126
And now we are fast approaching
the end of the fiscal year

05:44.126 --> 05:45.997
and still woefully short
on funds.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.695
- A big-ticket item, for sure.
- Yeah.

05:47.695 --> 05:50.219
So we're hoping Jack Dayton

05:50.219 --> 05:53.353
might consider
contributing the remainder.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.618
Roughly $10 million.
- OK.

05:57.618 --> 06:01.448
We have invited him to dinner
at the hospital tonight,

06:01.448 --> 06:03.928
and it'd be great if you
could join us, Dr. Marcel,

06:03.928 --> 06:06.453
given your close
personal relationship

06:06.453 --> 06:07.584
with the entrepreneur.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.847
I don't know
if I'd call us close.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.849
Not like I socialize
with the guy.

06:11.849 --> 06:14.461
Yeah, but you'd be able
to explain to him

06:14.461 --> 06:18.203
the benefits of the technology
from a surgical perspective.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.120
We know it's last minute, but--

06:22.120 --> 06:24.427
Asking Dayton
for $10 million

06:24.427 --> 06:26.342
right after I helped
rescue him?

06:26.342 --> 06:28.823
Kind of feels like
a quid pro quo.

06:28.823 --> 06:30.825
Exactly.
He is indebted to you.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.870
Well, that's not the way
I see it.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.481
My patients
don't owe me anything.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.831
Look, I think it's great
you're approaching Jack,

06:36.831 --> 06:37.875
and I hope he goes for it.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.529
I'm just--

06:39.529 --> 06:41.444
I'm not comfortable
making the ask.

06:41.444 --> 06:45.666
We understand, and this was
by no means mandatory.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.058
OK.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.974
But if you change your mind,

06:49.974 --> 06:54.457
dinner's at 7:30
in the executive dining room.

06:54.457 --> 06:55.980
All right.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.289
What?

07:01.899 --> 07:04.032
Hey, I need a second opinion

07:04.032 --> 07:05.773
on a patient's
renal ultrasound.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.252
And good morning to you.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.777
Does this look like
renal artery stenosis to you?

07:09.777 --> 07:11.343
Did you forget
I'm an obstetrician?

07:11.343 --> 07:13.868
I don't normally look
at these kinds of scans.

07:13.868 --> 07:16.523
Just tell me what you see.

07:16.523 --> 07:20.788
OK. Velocities are higher
than they should be, I think.

07:20.788 --> 07:24.618
And yeah, could be stenotic,
but it's hard to say,

07:24.618 --> 07:26.794
seeing especially since,
as we established,

07:26.794 --> 07:28.839
I'm not a nephrologist.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.450
OK, thanks.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.415
How bad would it be if I got
a candy bar for breakfast?

07:39.415 --> 07:41.112
No worse
than the decaf frappe

07:41.112 --> 07:43.158
with whipped cream
that I just downed.

07:43.158 --> 07:46.814
Please, can I just speak
with a doctor?

07:46.814 --> 07:48.206
Please, it won't take long.

07:48.206 --> 07:49.947
I'm afraid
that's not how it works.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.340
First fill out these forms.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.124
And I'm gonna need your ID
and insurance card

07:53.124 --> 07:54.474
if you have it.
- Forget it.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.388
Hey there.

07:56.388 --> 08:00.480
Is there something
we can do for you?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.220
How do you, um--

08:02.220 --> 08:05.746
how do you know
if something happened to you?

08:05.746 --> 08:07.617
Do you think something
might have happened to you?

08:10.925 --> 08:13.057
Let's take a seat.
What's your name?

08:13.057 --> 08:15.320
I don't want my name
recorded anywhere.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.323
Like, in your system.
- No, just between us.

08:18.323 --> 08:21.152
- Gloria.
- Hi, Gloria.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.590
I'm Nellie.
This is Hannah.

08:23.590 --> 08:27.898
Just talk to us like we're
one of your girlfriends, OK?

08:27.898 --> 08:30.422
Tell us what happened.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.599
Last night,
I went to this party.

08:32.599 --> 08:36.080
It was at a big warehouse
in Pilsen.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.779
I was supposed
to meet my cousin there,

08:38.779 --> 08:41.042
but I couldn't find her.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.566
There were just so many people.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.525
And then?

08:47.091 --> 08:49.572
I don't remember.

08:49.572 --> 08:53.837
I had a drink,
just one drink,

08:53.837 --> 08:55.665
and that's--

08:55.665 --> 08:58.538
that's the last thing
I remember.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.456
When I woke up this morning,

09:04.456 --> 09:07.547
I was still there,
at the warehouse,

09:07.547 --> 09:11.899
in this room
I didn't recognize.

09:11.899 --> 09:14.336
Was there anyone there
with you?

09:15.903 --> 09:20.690
But my underwear was gone.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.039
I don't know what happened.

09:22.039 --> 09:24.389
We're gonna figure this out together.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.219
Come with us, OK?

09:32.789 --> 09:35.183
So Lydia has
an autoimmune disease

09:35.183 --> 09:38.055
called
primary biliary cholangitis.

09:38.055 --> 09:40.405
The disease,
it destroys the bile ducts

09:40.405 --> 09:41.972
and can lead to liver failure,

09:41.972 --> 09:44.627
which unfortunately is what
we're seeing in Lydia's case.

09:44.627 --> 09:47.151
She's 15!
She doesn't even drive yet!

09:47.151 --> 09:49.371
It is rare to see PBC
in adolescents,

09:49.371 --> 09:50.851
although there have
been reported cases

09:50.851 --> 09:52.026
of pediatric onset.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.201
If her liver is the problem,

09:53.201 --> 09:55.029
why is her brain
being affected?

09:55.029 --> 09:56.900
When the liver
isn't functioning

09:56.900 --> 09:58.249
how it's supposed to,

09:58.249 --> 10:00.643
it stops filtering toxins
from the bloodstream.

10:00.643 --> 10:04.081
And then these toxins build up
and travel to the brain.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.866
But the condition
is only temporary.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.955
And with medication,
her cognitive function

10:07.955 --> 10:09.217
will return to normal.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.654
What about her liver?

10:11.654 --> 10:14.222
Lydia is going to need
a liver transplant.

10:20.184 --> 10:23.013
So how do we do that?

10:23.013 --> 10:24.841
How do we find her a new liver?

10:24.841 --> 10:26.538
We'll get Lydia evaluated

10:26.538 --> 10:28.671
for the transplant list,
the national registry,

10:28.671 --> 10:31.674
but her fastest bet
would be a living donor.

10:31.674 --> 10:35.591
What's pretty cool about
the liver is it regenerates.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.680
So you can give someone
a portion of your liver,

10:37.680 --> 10:39.464
and it grows back
to its original size

10:39.464 --> 10:41.815
after the transplant.

10:41.815 --> 10:44.644
I would, um, give her mine
in a heartbeat,

10:44.644 --> 10:48.343
but I'm a recovering alcoholic.

10:48.343 --> 10:50.345
As long as you've been sober
for six months,

10:50.345 --> 10:52.739
that's not
an exclusionary criterion, OK?

10:52.739 --> 10:55.219
We will want to run some tests
to check your liver function.

10:55.219 --> 10:57.918
Of course.
Whatever you need to do.

10:57.918 --> 11:00.660
I would give anything
to help my daughter.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.230
- Maggie.
- This better be good.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.058
Showing up at my job unannounced

11:08.058 --> 11:09.407
is quite the overstep.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.757
Didn't you get my text?

11:10.757 --> 11:12.280
No, my phone's been
on the charger

11:12.280 --> 11:13.455
all morning.
What is it?

11:13.455 --> 11:14.674
I got to show you
something outside.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.763
I can't, Grant.
I'm working.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.939
Just five minutes.
That's all I'm asking.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.854
I don't want to be a bother,
but you're the only person

11:20.854 --> 11:23.639
who will understand.

11:23.639 --> 11:26.163
Give me 20 minutes.
I'll take my lunch break early.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.557
- Meet you out front.
- OK.

11:28.557 --> 11:31.038
Congrats on your big news,
buddy. Mazel tov.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.866
Thank you.
I'm pretty excited.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.215
Could have given me
a little more time

11:34.215 --> 11:35.999
to dust off the old tux, though.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.654
Damn.
- Sorry about that.

11:38.654 --> 11:43.006
You know, my dad's passing
crystallized a lot for me

11:43.006 --> 11:46.618
about the man I want to be,
the life I want to have,

11:46.618 --> 11:49.709
and an urgency
to get those changes now.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.101
Makes sense.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.842
It's probably why things
are so easy with April

11:52.842 --> 11:54.452
this time around.

11:54.452 --> 11:59.196
I guess I got closer to the guy
she was holding out for.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.502
Nice.

12:00.502 --> 12:02.417
Hey, I need some help.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.332
I got a guy in trouble
a few blocks away.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.334
Hey, I'm Dr. Choi.
What's going on?

12:06.334 --> 12:07.683
There's this homeless guy, Buddy.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.772
He kind of lives
behind my apartment building.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.861
Something's wrong with him.
I called 911.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.820
But they said the ambulance is
gonna take, like, 20 minutes.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.822
I don't know.
He doesn't look so good.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.867
- Can you take us to him?
- Yeah, follow me.

12:20.870 --> 12:21.871
Buddy!

12:23.917 --> 12:25.962
Buddy.
Hey, Buddy.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.050
He's breathing, right?

12:27.050 --> 12:28.269
Respirations are shallow,

12:28.269 --> 12:29.792
but yeah,
he's breathing.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.402
How long
has he been here for?

12:31.402 --> 12:33.013
Buddy's been a fixture
since I moved in,

12:33.013 --> 12:34.797
so at least four years.

12:34.797 --> 12:37.582
You notice any changes
in his behavior recently?

12:37.582 --> 12:39.019
Buddy disappeared
for a couple nights,

12:39.019 --> 12:40.847
maybe about a month ago.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.762
I don't know where he went,
but when he came back,

12:42.762 --> 12:44.807
he wasn't moving around
as well.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.201
He just seemed more out of it
than usual.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.564
My name won't be on the--

13:02.564 --> 13:04.218
it won't be attached
to anything?

13:04.218 --> 13:05.828
It can all
be processed anonymously.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.525
And you won't release
any of my information

13:07.525 --> 13:09.049
to the police, right?
- Mm-mm.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.225
Not without your permission.

13:11.225 --> 13:14.097
Oh, I forgot to ask.
How much is it gonna cost?

13:14.097 --> 13:15.664
I don't have insurance
or anything, so--

13:15.664 --> 13:16.752
Nothing.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.362
There's
no patient responsibility.

13:18.362 --> 13:19.624
And we'll give you a voucher

13:19.624 --> 13:22.192
for any additional
follow-up costs.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.933
Would you like a Valium?

13:23.933 --> 13:25.369
It can help calm your nerves.

13:25.369 --> 13:28.416
No, no, no, I don't want
to black out again.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.418
It's actually
just a mild sedative.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.854
No!

13:31.854 --> 13:34.857
Thanks, but no.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.467
OK.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.165
We're ready
to begin the exam.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.863
OK, Gloria?

13:40.863 --> 13:43.823
OK, so sit back a little,
put your feet in the stirrups.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.868
And if at any point
you need me to stop,

13:45.868 --> 13:49.002
if you need to take a break,
you just let me know, OK?

13:49.002 --> 13:53.354
All right, I'm putting my hand
on the inside of your thigh.

13:53.354 --> 13:54.921
Next, I'm gonna
take a quick look

13:54.921 --> 13:56.879
at the outside area first.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.228
Here.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.795
Squeeze as hard as you need.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.494
OK.

14:03.494 --> 14:06.236
Now you're gonna feel
the tip of the speculum.

14:06.236 --> 14:08.282
You're doing really great.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.415
So what do you think?

14:11.415 --> 14:12.721
I know her liver's
on the cusp, but--

14:12.721 --> 14:14.114
I've got to disagree
with you there, Will.

14:14.114 --> 14:16.246
It's not on the cusp.
Not even close.

14:16.246 --> 14:17.421
Well, what do you mean?

14:17.421 --> 14:19.075
Danielle's liver function
is solid.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.685
Yeah, now,
but the damage is done.

14:20.685 --> 14:22.774
The liver's fibrotic.
- Mildly.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.559
It won't tolerate
a partial resection.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.213
Well, that's a prediction,
not a fact.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.389
A good chance
it'll fail to regenerate.

14:28.389 --> 14:30.043
And then Mom will need
a liver transplant.

14:30.043 --> 14:33.307
Maybe that's a risk
Danielle's willing to take.

14:33.307 --> 14:35.526
But if Danielle ended up
needing a new liver

14:35.526 --> 14:37.267
after we allowed her to donate,

14:37.267 --> 14:38.616
that's the kind of bad outcome

14:38.616 --> 14:41.663
that could get
a transplant program shut down.

14:41.663 --> 14:43.143
I'm sorry, man.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.805
My, my, my.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.982
My goodness.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.071
Is that--
- It is.

14:58.071 --> 14:59.681
No!

15:01.683 --> 15:03.380
What happened
to the peeling vinyl top

15:03.380 --> 15:04.642
that used to flap in the wind?

15:04.642 --> 15:07.384
Gone.
That and the cracked window.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.082
Got the heating
and air fixed too.

15:09.082 --> 15:12.128
Oh, my word.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.826
You know,
I love this car.

15:14.826 --> 15:16.263
It's the only reason
I gave you the time of day

15:16.263 --> 15:18.308
in high school.

15:18.308 --> 15:20.441
I've been restoring it
for years now.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.095
You did all this yourself?

15:22.095 --> 15:23.400
For the most part.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.359
Just got the leather seats reupholstered.

15:25.359 --> 15:27.230
The finishing touch.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.971
- Wow.
- What do you say?

15:28.971 --> 15:31.843
A spin around the block,
for old time's sake?

15:31.843 --> 15:32.844
Aw.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.759
Come on.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.326
A quick spin.

15:36.326 --> 15:37.588
My break's over in 30.

15:37.588 --> 15:39.939
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh!

15:41.331 --> 15:43.290
Do you happen
to know his full name?

15:43.290 --> 15:44.769
Everyone
just calls him Buddy.

15:44.769 --> 15:48.077
He's a friendly guy
but not all there.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.383
How so?

15:49.383 --> 15:51.341
Sometimes I'll see him
talking to no one,

15:51.341 --> 15:53.691
and he repeats himself a lot.

15:53.691 --> 15:57.913
It just seems like his, um,
processing is kind of delayed.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.743
Hey, I'm really sorry,
but I'm super late for work.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.179
Oh, look, we really
appreciate you hanging around

16:03.179 --> 16:04.311
while we got him situated, OK?

16:04.311 --> 16:05.965
Thank you very much.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.054
So I found a partially healed
puncture site in his groin.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.578
It looks like he developed
a postprocedural abscess.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.536
I'm gonna drain it
and start antibiotics.

16:12.536 --> 16:13.581
Wonder
what the procedure was for.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.670
Or where it was done.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.802
Hawley Community Hospital.

16:17.802 --> 16:19.021
It's still
in pretty good shape,

16:19.021 --> 16:21.067
so it must have been
a fairly recent visit.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.938
Is there a name
on that bracelet?

16:22.938 --> 16:24.679
William "Buddy" Foster.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.289
Clip that off for me,
will you, Doris?

16:26.289 --> 16:28.291
I'm gonna look up that hospital
and then give them a call.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.684
Hawley?

16:29.684 --> 16:30.946
I mean,
it kind of rings a bell,

16:30.946 --> 16:33.644
but I'm pretty sure
it's outside of Chicago.

16:33.644 --> 16:36.038
I wonder
how he ended up there.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.997
Yeah.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.694
Any other family members

16:39.694 --> 16:41.217
that might be willing
to get evaluated?

16:41.217 --> 16:42.827
See if they're a match
for Lydia?

16:42.827 --> 16:47.049
No, she's, um--
she's an only child.

16:47.049 --> 16:52.054
Her father also had problems
with alcohol.

16:52.054 --> 16:55.449
Smashed his car into a tree two
years ago and died on impact.

16:55.449 --> 16:57.320
We're so sorry.

16:58.713 --> 16:59.975
With the transplant list,

16:59.975 --> 17:03.022
how long do you think
Lydia will have to wait?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.936
It is impossible to predict.

17:04.936 --> 17:08.766
It can take just a few weeks,
or it can take months.

17:08.766 --> 17:11.421
Years sometimes.

17:11.421 --> 17:16.731
So, um, just prepare myself
for anything?

17:16.731 --> 17:20.039
Yeah. We'll check on Lydia
in a bit, OK?

17:24.434 --> 17:26.871
Man, that's rough.

17:26.871 --> 17:29.048
Worst feeling in the world,
I imagine.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.311
Doing search and rescue,
you meet these parents

17:31.311 --> 17:33.965
who are just so desperate
to help.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.967
It's heartbreaking
telling them they can't.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.013
Yeah, only adds salt
that Danielle's past

17:38.013 --> 17:40.668
is what's preventing her
from donating.

17:40.668 --> 17:43.410
Talk about
a cruel twist, huh?

17:43.410 --> 17:45.803
If it was any other organ.

17:45.803 --> 17:48.502
I mean, her kidneys
are perfectly healthy.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.289
Dr. Halstead?

17:53.289 --> 17:56.118
Her kidneys are healthy.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.728
I think you're on to something.

18:10.437 --> 18:11.786
You're staring.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.657
I'm sorry.

18:13.657 --> 18:16.051
I just never thought
you'd be riding shotgun

18:16.051 --> 18:17.008
in this car again.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.401
Well...

18:18.401 --> 18:19.968
It used to give me
such a rush back in the day,

18:19.968 --> 18:22.710
looking over
and seeing you next to me.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.062
Still does.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.415
Grant.

18:34.417 --> 18:35.679
No.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.385
Grant!

18:51.826 --> 18:54.002
You're talking about
a paired exchange, right?

18:54.002 --> 18:55.308
It won't work.

18:55.308 --> 18:56.831
Both the donors need
to have healthy livers.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.137
Well, not exactly.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.486
It's called
a trans-organ paired exchange.

18:59.486 --> 19:00.574
Oh, yeah.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.402
I heard it discussed
at a conference.

19:02.402 --> 19:03.707
Pretty new concept, right?

19:03.707 --> 19:05.187
Only a couple have
been performed in the U.S.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.754
It's rare,
but this kind of swap

19:06.754 --> 19:09.235
is allowed under the
National Organ Transplant Act.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.714
Uh-huh.
Thank you.

19:10.714 --> 19:13.500
So you're suggesting
that Danielle donate her kidney

19:13.500 --> 19:15.110
to someone
on the transplant list...

19:15.110 --> 19:16.894
Someone already
with a willing donor

19:16.894 --> 19:18.983
who was ruled out
for a kidney-specific reason.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.898
And then they would donate
their liver to Lydia?

19:20.898 --> 19:23.510
Like a paired exchange,
except with different organs.

19:23.510 --> 19:24.989
Well, it's not exactly
like for like.

19:24.989 --> 19:27.166
A liver transplant exposes
the donor to greater risk.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.297
But if we can identify

19:28.297 --> 19:30.081
a potential
donor recipient match,

19:30.081 --> 19:31.387
walk them through
the added risk factors...

19:31.387 --> 19:33.041
And we have to loop in legal.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.738
The whole nine yards.
- Of course.

19:34.738 --> 19:37.959
I'm not trying
to do anything below board.

19:37.959 --> 19:40.527
OK, I think I have an idea
for a second donor.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.398
Frank Sheraton.
Late 40s.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.879
He's in good health, but due
to a mild reduction in GFR,

19:44.879 --> 19:46.968
he couldn't donate his kidney
to his wife, Roberta.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.710
She's been on the transplant
list for three years.

19:49.710 --> 19:50.972
Before we get
anyone's hopes up,

19:50.972 --> 19:52.321
let's make sure Frank's a match
for Lydia,

19:52.321 --> 19:53.757
Danielle for Roberta.

19:53.757 --> 19:54.889
I'll pull up their charts.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.282
Dr. Lieu, you want
to give me a hand?

19:56.282 --> 19:57.370
- Happy to.
- All right.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.676
We'll circle back in a bit.
- Great.

19:59.676 --> 20:02.375
- Dr. Halstead, there you are.
- What's wrong?

20:02.375 --> 20:05.247
Maggie and a friend
were in a car accident.

20:05.247 --> 20:07.858
The ambulance is en route.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.080
Maggie,
you should be on a gurney.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.255
I'm fine.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.430
That's what I said,
but she refused.

20:14.430 --> 20:15.997
Going to Baghdad.
Matt, talk to me.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.346
Grant Young.
44-year-old male.

20:17.346 --> 20:18.608
High-speed motor vehicle crash.

20:18.608 --> 20:22.264
GCS 15, BP 120/72.
Heart rate 110.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.310
Large laceration on the--
- To the left calf.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.920
Active bleeding
for almost four minutes.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.401
I initially tried
to control it with pressure.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.793
Hey, Grant.
I'm Dr. Halstead.

20:29.793 --> 20:31.230
A piece of shrapnel
or something from the door

20:31.230 --> 20:32.274
sliced the leg.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.754
Uh, it looks arterial.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.799
Thank you, Maggie.
I got it from here.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.888
Come on, Maggie.
Let me look you over.

20:37.888 --> 20:38.846
Come.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.153
Gloria.

20:42.153 --> 20:43.677
Hey.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.026
You want to have a seat?

20:45.026 --> 20:47.550
That's OK.
I prefer to stand.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.291
OK, sure.

20:50.771 --> 20:53.991
So your labs came back positive
for GHB.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.603
It's what's commonly known
as a date rape drug.

20:56.603 --> 20:59.301
And while we can't make
any definitive conclusions

20:59.301 --> 21:00.868
until your kit is tested,

21:00.868 --> 21:04.175
there was evidence
that you sustained injuries

21:04.175 --> 21:05.916
from a sexual assault.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.617
What kind of evidence?

21:10.617 --> 21:12.967
Bruising
in your genital area,

21:12.967 --> 21:14.838
a possible fingerprint pattern.

21:20.888 --> 21:22.803
What about STDs?

21:22.803 --> 21:24.979
Your HIV, gonorrhea,
and chlamydia tests

21:24.979 --> 21:26.459
all came back negative,

21:26.459 --> 21:27.851
but you'll need to follow up

21:27.851 --> 21:30.593
to do retesting
in two to three weeks.

21:32.508 --> 21:36.338
Is it too early to know if--

21:36.338 --> 21:38.427
if I'm pregnant?

21:38.427 --> 21:40.821
Your pregnancy test
came back negative,

21:40.821 --> 21:43.650
but you'll want to retest
in two weeks.

21:45.869 --> 21:48.307
Is that it?
Is that everything?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.482
Can I go home now?

21:49.482 --> 21:52.093
Well, first we wanted
to talk with you

21:52.093 --> 21:53.486
about some of the counseling

21:53.486 --> 21:55.183
and mental health services available.

21:55.183 --> 21:57.577
All free of charge.

21:57.577 --> 22:00.101
I really want to go home.

22:00.101 --> 22:03.496
Forget it ever happened.

22:03.496 --> 22:05.585
If you do change your mind,

22:05.585 --> 22:08.762
all of the information and
the phone numbers are in here.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.894
Both of ours included.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.331
Thanks.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.769
Gloria, you said initially

22:15.769 --> 22:17.205
that you didn't want
to involve the police.

22:17.205 --> 22:18.598
- I don't.
- OK.

22:18.598 --> 22:21.383
You do understand, though,
that without a report,

22:21.383 --> 22:24.038
they're not able
to open an investigation,

22:24.038 --> 22:27.520
so they're not able to find
the person who did this to you.

22:27.520 --> 22:31.262
It's not like
I'd press charges anyway.

22:31.262 --> 22:32.786
I just--

22:32.786 --> 22:36.790
I needed to know what happened
for myself.

22:36.790 --> 22:38.052
That's it.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.837
That's enough.

22:40.837 --> 22:43.231
No one else can know.

22:43.231 --> 22:44.450
Gloria, I understand,
right now,

22:44.450 --> 22:45.407
this is very traumatizing--

22:45.407 --> 22:47.061
OK, Gloria.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.410
We hear you.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.499
We'll get your discharge
paperwork started.

22:59.290 --> 23:00.988
Hey.
That's it?

23:00.988 --> 23:03.425
I feel like we should be having
a more substantial conversation

23:03.425 --> 23:05.253
with her about reporting.
- No.

23:05.253 --> 23:07.560
Her unwillingness to show ID,

23:07.560 --> 23:09.562
lack of insurance,
fear of the police.

23:09.562 --> 23:14.436
I suspect that
Gloria might be undocumented.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.745
Let's not push too hard, OK?

23:18.745 --> 23:21.008
But I believe
there are legal protections

23:21.008 --> 23:22.183
for undocumented immigrants

23:22.183 --> 23:23.706
that report crimes
like sexual assault.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.926
And while you may believe
in those protections, Hannah,

23:25.926 --> 23:29.016
Gloria might not,
and we have to respect that.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.241
Buddy, what we're trying
to figure out

23:37.241 --> 23:40.636
is if you can remember going
to a hospital recently.

23:40.636 --> 23:41.768
Yeah.

23:41.768 --> 23:44.118
Yeah, I went
to the hospital before.

23:44.118 --> 23:45.162
That's right.

23:45.162 --> 23:48.078
And how'd you get there?

23:48.078 --> 23:49.906
Real nice lady drove me.

23:49.906 --> 23:52.779
She bought me dinner too.

23:52.779 --> 23:55.216
Were you hurt?

23:55.216 --> 23:56.826
No.
Don't think so.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.915
No.
- Huh.

23:58.915 --> 24:00.656
I wonder why she--

24:00.656 --> 24:03.311
she took you
to the hospital, then.

24:03.311 --> 24:05.313
Guess I needed to go.

24:05.313 --> 24:07.620
A real nice lady.

24:07.620 --> 24:10.013
She bought me dinner.
- OK.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.627
Um, you know what?

24:14.627 --> 24:17.151
We're gonna step out
for a second and be right back.

24:17.151 --> 24:18.195
- Sure.
- Yeah, all right.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.067
Sit tight.
- Sure.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.028
All right, so I got in touch
with Hawley Community Hospital.

24:25.028 --> 24:29.337
It's about two hours north of
the city, in Wisconsin, right?

24:29.337 --> 24:31.339
Buddy was there a month ago.

24:31.339 --> 24:32.688
Two-night stay

24:32.688 --> 24:36.170
for a left atrial
appendage occlusion procedure.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.650
Aren't LA occlusions done

24:37.650 --> 24:40.348
to prevent stroke
in patients with a-fib?

24:40.348 --> 24:43.133
Buddy hasn't flipped into
a-fib once since he got here.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.526
It's an elective procedure

24:44.526 --> 24:47.398
on an unhoused patient
in a different state.

24:47.398 --> 24:49.226
How'd they expect him
to get back

24:49.226 --> 24:50.619
for his follow-up stuff?

24:50.619 --> 24:51.968
Or keep
his surgical site clean?

24:51.968 --> 24:53.840
It's no wonder he ended up
with an infection.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.103
At best, I think we're
looking at extreme negligence.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.452
I think it's worse.

24:57.452 --> 24:58.975
Buddy mentioned a lady
picking him up

24:58.975 --> 25:01.021
and driving him
to the hospital.

25:01.021 --> 25:03.371
Ah, a recruiter.

25:03.371 --> 25:05.852
Probably gets a kickback
for every patient she finds.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.549
Oh, my gosh.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.899
I think we're looking
at Medicaid fraud.

25:14.774 --> 25:16.427
It's not
what it looks like, Sharon.

25:16.427 --> 25:19.605
Who said
it looked like anything?

25:19.605 --> 25:21.955
No one's judging you.

25:21.955 --> 25:23.391
Hey, I just wanted
to let you know

25:23.391 --> 25:24.784
I sent Grant to angio

25:24.784 --> 25:26.568
to see if there's
any vessel damage to his leg.

25:26.568 --> 25:27.961
Thanks for the update, Will.

25:27.961 --> 25:29.658
Of course.

25:29.658 --> 25:31.051
How's your patient,
Ms. Goodwin?

25:31.051 --> 25:34.054
Stubborn
with a chance of just fine.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.885
Maggie, you want me
to call Ben for you?

25:38.885 --> 25:41.017
No, no, no.
That's OK.

25:41.017 --> 25:44.586
Ben's away at a teacher's
conference in Florida.

25:44.586 --> 25:47.241
I'll let him know
when he comes home on Friday.

25:47.241 --> 25:48.764
Sure.

25:55.902 --> 25:57.251
Hannah.

25:57.251 --> 25:58.600
Hey, do you have a minute?

25:58.600 --> 26:00.080
Yeah, of course.
What's up?

26:01.385 --> 26:02.778
Her name is Chelsea.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.345
She walked into the district
this morning

26:04.345 --> 26:06.086
to report a possible rape.

26:06.086 --> 26:07.740
A possible rape?

26:07.740 --> 26:10.046
Blacked out at
a warehouse party last night.

26:10.046 --> 26:12.745
She thinks someone
slipped something in her drink.

26:12.745 --> 26:14.747
Was it in Pilsen?

26:14.747 --> 26:17.576
Yeah.
How did you know that?

26:23.756 --> 26:26.367
So I donate a lobe of
my liver to this young woman,

26:26.367 --> 26:27.542
and the girl's mother
would give her kidney

26:27.542 --> 26:29.065
to Roberta?
- Exactly.

26:29.065 --> 26:31.764
We've done the legwork,
and you're a compatible donor.

26:31.764 --> 26:35.158
And the mother is a match
for you, Roberta.

26:35.158 --> 26:37.639
Well then, yeah.
Absolutely. I'm in.

26:37.639 --> 26:40.294
How soon can they operate?
- Frank, hold on a second.

26:40.294 --> 26:43.558
I think we have to ask
a few more questions.

26:43.558 --> 26:45.429
We learned
all about kidney donation

26:45.429 --> 26:47.649
when Frank was evaluated
to be a donor for me.

26:47.649 --> 26:52.088
Donating the liver,
is this a similar undertaking?

26:52.088 --> 26:54.351
Well,
to be completely honest,

26:54.351 --> 26:57.050
it's a bigger undertaking.

26:57.050 --> 26:59.400
It's an open surgery with
a large abdominal incision.

26:59.400 --> 27:00.706
And because of the incision,

27:00.706 --> 27:02.533
it is a harder recovery
than kidney donation.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.100
Usually about twice as long.

27:04.100 --> 27:05.928
Oh, then no.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.016
- Babe.
- No.

27:07.016 --> 27:08.104
We have to think
about the kids.

27:08.104 --> 27:09.410
I am.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.107
They need their mom.

27:11.107 --> 27:13.936
We all need you.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.372
Hey, remember,

27:15.372 --> 27:17.766
I survived five skydives
and three bungee jumps.

27:17.766 --> 27:20.769
You think I'm gonna let
a little surgery take me out?

27:20.769 --> 27:23.685
Surgery is probably
the safest place for me.

27:23.685 --> 27:26.296
And the fact that this is gonna
help someone else out too?

27:26.296 --> 27:28.385
Even better.

27:28.385 --> 27:30.649
Let me do this.

27:38.134 --> 27:39.614
Is this a yes?

27:41.007 --> 27:42.791
OK.

27:42.791 --> 27:46.447
Great.

27:46.447 --> 27:49.711
I understand that
the evidence from Gloria's exam

27:49.711 --> 27:52.758
would strengthen any future
case against the assailant,

27:52.758 --> 27:55.586
but I really don't think
revisiting the topic

27:55.586 --> 27:57.284
is going to change her mind.

27:57.284 --> 27:58.764
Well, I think we should try.

27:58.764 --> 28:01.114
So you want her
to risk her future,

28:01.114 --> 28:04.900
or her family's future, for
someone she doesn't even know?

28:04.900 --> 28:06.075
No, I'm not saying that.

28:06.075 --> 28:07.990
Because that's her dilemma, Hannah.

28:07.990 --> 28:11.080
And you can promise her
till you're blue in the face

28:11.080 --> 28:12.603
that the system
will protect her

28:12.603 --> 28:14.693
and fight for her rights
just like they fight for yours,

28:14.693 --> 28:17.260
but I bet she's seen enough
evidence to the contrary

28:17.260 --> 28:19.436
to know better.

28:19.436 --> 28:21.438
I'm not suggesting
that Gloria do this

28:21.438 --> 28:23.702
for someone else.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.530
I'm thinking of Gloria
and how it's gonna feel

28:26.530 --> 28:28.924
to carry this trauma
for the rest of her life.

28:30.926 --> 28:35.017
My college roommate, Annie,
was raped at a frat party.

28:35.017 --> 28:37.759
She didn't know who did it.
Didn't report it to anyone.

28:37.759 --> 28:40.327
And she said exactly
what Gloria said.

28:40.327 --> 28:42.503
She just wanted to forget
it ever happened.

28:42.503 --> 28:44.244
And so,
she put all her energy

28:44.244 --> 28:46.942
into pretending like
it didn't matter,

28:46.942 --> 28:49.118
like holding someone
accountable didn't matter.

28:49.118 --> 28:51.773
And somewhere along the way,
I think she began to believe

28:51.773 --> 28:54.515
it didn't matter.

28:54.515 --> 28:57.257
That she didn't matter.

28:58.780 --> 29:02.392
And she carried that feeling
as long as she could

29:02.392 --> 29:05.918
before taking her own life.

29:05.918 --> 29:08.181
Oh, Hannah.

29:08.181 --> 29:09.225
I'm so sorry.

29:09.225 --> 29:11.750
So no, I'm not--

29:11.750 --> 29:15.623
I'm not insensitive
to the enormity

29:15.623 --> 29:17.756
of what we are potentially
asking Gloria to do.

29:17.756 --> 29:21.498
It's just I have seen
the other side of it.

29:21.498 --> 29:24.458
The consequence of sweeping
a trauma under the rug.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.814
Dr. Martin Grainer,

29:32.814 --> 29:36.513
the interventional cardiologist
who did Buddy's procedure.

29:36.513 --> 29:38.341
I noticed that
he was moving around a lot,

29:38.341 --> 29:40.256
so I started calling
some of these hospitals.

29:40.256 --> 29:41.780
- Yeah?
- Lost privileges

29:41.780 --> 29:43.172
in pretty much
every single one of them.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.652
I mean, how the hell is
this guy still practicing?

29:44.652 --> 29:46.480
- You all right?
- Yeah.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.960
I slept funny.
That's all.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.570
They didn't feel like
they could prove

29:49.570 --> 29:52.660
that he was fabricating
indications for procedures.

29:52.660 --> 29:53.835
Hey.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.271
That's the doctor
who treated Buddy.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.447
Dr. Martin Grainer.

29:57.447 --> 29:59.754
So Buddy's labs came back,

29:59.754 --> 30:01.930
and his PSA was
through the roof.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.279
Sent him for imaging,

30:03.279 --> 30:05.804
and he has advanced stage
prostate cancer.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.415
It's all over his body,
in his brain, his spine.

30:08.415 --> 30:10.330
Nothing we could do for him
at this point.

30:10.330 --> 30:12.985
So while this sorry excuse
for a doctor

30:12.985 --> 30:15.857
is making up all
these bogus medical problems...

30:15.857 --> 30:18.817
He could have been treating
him for something very real.

30:25.519 --> 30:26.520
See that?

30:26.520 --> 30:28.391
You have
a small pseudo-aneurysm

30:28.391 --> 30:30.654
of the posterior tibial artery.

30:30.654 --> 30:32.004
That sounds ominous.

30:32.004 --> 30:33.744
It's not as scary
as it sounds.

30:33.744 --> 30:35.485
It's a small
pressurized pool of blood

30:35.485 --> 30:36.922
that can form
following injury

30:36.922 --> 30:38.401
to the wall
of the blood vessel.

30:38.401 --> 30:39.838
That will likely resolve
on its own

30:39.838 --> 30:41.709
without any need
for surgical intervention.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.929
We'll just want you back
next week for an ultrasound.

30:43.929 --> 30:47.976
That's... a relief.

30:47.976 --> 30:49.412
Definitely.

30:53.199 --> 30:55.592
If you'll excuse me, I have
to check on another patient.

30:55.592 --> 30:58.160
Thanks, Will.

30:58.160 --> 31:01.511
Well, that's good news.

31:01.511 --> 31:02.991
Yes, it is.

31:05.298 --> 31:09.084
Look, I've just been lying
here, doing a lot of thinking,

31:09.084 --> 31:11.870
and I crossed the line.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.349
Plain and simple.

31:13.349 --> 31:15.438
I'm really sorry, Maggie.

31:15.438 --> 31:18.180
Riding around
in that old Monte Carlo,

31:18.180 --> 31:23.577
I think we just both
forgot ourselves for a moment.

31:23.577 --> 31:27.842
I guess I thought maybe
we could be friends, but...

31:27.842 --> 31:29.409
There's just
too much history.

31:29.409 --> 31:30.932
Yeah.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.455
I know that now.

31:32.455 --> 31:33.630
I do.

31:56.479 --> 31:58.960
Gloria, you are so brave
to come here.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.310
And if you need anything
at all,

32:01.310 --> 32:03.225
you've got both of our numbers.

32:03.225 --> 32:05.924
And I really hope you consider

32:05.924 --> 32:07.795
attending one
of those support groups.

32:07.795 --> 32:11.016
Yeah, I'll think about it.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.278
Dr. Cuevas.

32:12.278 --> 32:13.801
Nellie, I mean.

32:13.801 --> 32:15.977
I was hoping I'd see you
before I left.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.457
Before you go, Gloria,

32:17.457 --> 32:21.896
I wanted to, uh,
share something with you.

32:23.202 --> 32:27.641
It's not something
a lot of my colleagues know.

32:27.641 --> 32:32.951
Um, something
Dr. Asher doesn't know.

32:37.042 --> 32:40.132
I'm, um...

32:40.132 --> 32:43.526
I'm undocumented.

32:45.050 --> 32:48.575
My family immigrated
to the U.S.

32:48.575 --> 32:51.752
before I could walk.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.710
And as a DACA recipient,

32:53.710 --> 32:57.018
I'm legally allowed
to work and live here,

32:57.018 --> 33:01.631
but I still keep my immigration
status close to the vest.

33:01.631 --> 33:07.507
But I'm telling you
because I trust you.

33:08.682 --> 33:12.642
And I trust Dr. Asher.

33:14.253 --> 33:18.866
So if you ever want
to report what happened,

33:18.866 --> 33:23.218
now or at some point
in the future,

33:23.218 --> 33:27.440
Dr. Asher and I know someone
who will have your back.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.050
Someone you can trust.

33:41.628 --> 33:45.066
Roberta, Frank, this is
Lydia and her mom, Danielle.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.981
I don't know
how to thank you both enough.

33:46.981 --> 33:48.548
I should be thanking you.

33:48.548 --> 33:51.029
You don't even know me,
and you're giving me...

33:52.421 --> 33:54.032
Can I hug you?
- Yes.

33:58.514 --> 34:00.734
We'll give you all some time
to get acquainted.

34:02.518 --> 34:05.086
I hope trans-organ exchanges
become more commonplace.

34:05.086 --> 34:06.479
It would increase

34:06.479 --> 34:08.568
the number of potential donors significantly.

34:08.568 --> 34:10.265
Yeah,
and would allow donors

34:10.265 --> 34:12.441
who were previously ruled out
to still help their loved ones.

34:14.835 --> 34:17.664
Quid pro quo.

34:17.664 --> 34:20.623
Yeah, and everybody wins.

34:20.623 --> 34:22.234
Well, hey,
if you guys aren't above

34:22.234 --> 34:25.454
grabbing a beer with an intern,
first round's on me.

34:25.454 --> 34:27.413
Definitely
not above a free beer.

34:27.413 --> 34:29.328
What do you say, Crockett?

34:29.328 --> 34:31.634
I'm gonna have to join
you fellas another time.

34:31.634 --> 34:32.766
Cheers.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.118
Hey, Gloria.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.641
This is Detective Upton.

34:38.641 --> 34:41.122
You can call me Hailey.
We can talk here, if you want.

34:41.122 --> 34:42.819
We can go outside for a walk,
get some air.

34:42.819 --> 34:44.212
Up to you.

34:44.212 --> 34:45.692
Here is fine.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.085
OK.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.522
We'll check back on you soon.

34:54.744 --> 34:56.311
I just hope
they find who did this

34:56.311 --> 34:57.878
before any other women
are harmed.

34:57.878 --> 35:00.837
Gloria's statement,
the evidence from her exam.

35:00.837 --> 35:04.885
They're gonna help CPD's
investigation tremendously.

35:04.885 --> 35:09.803
Hannah,
like I said to Gloria,

35:09.803 --> 35:11.631
I don't advertise my status.

35:11.631 --> 35:14.634
It's your business,
nobody else's.

35:14.634 --> 35:15.678
I won't tell anyone.

35:15.678 --> 35:17.680
Thank you.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.205
It is incredible,
what you've accomplished.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.729
Going to med school,
becoming a doctor.

35:22.729 --> 35:24.818
It hasn't been easy.

35:24.818 --> 35:29.692
And with legal challenges
constantly on the horizon,

35:29.692 --> 35:35.002
DACA's future and my future
always feels a bit precarious.

35:35.002 --> 35:40.094
But surrounding myself
with good people really helps.

35:40.094 --> 35:42.488
People I can trust.

35:46.927 --> 35:48.842
Oh, Maggie.
Come on in.

35:48.842 --> 35:52.585
I have to head to this dinner,
but I'm glad you stopped by.

35:52.585 --> 35:53.629
OK.

35:56.110 --> 35:57.764
So how are you feeling?

35:57.764 --> 36:00.767
Uh, OK.

36:00.767 --> 36:04.074
I've decided to, um,

36:04.074 --> 36:07.208
not tell Ben
about the accident.

36:07.208 --> 36:10.211
For the time being, or--

36:10.211 --> 36:12.213
Ever.

36:12.213 --> 36:14.389
Are you sure
that's what you want to do?

36:14.389 --> 36:17.566
There's just no benefit
to him knowing.

36:17.566 --> 36:21.440
Well, I think
Ben might beg to differ.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.747
Grant has just caused so
many problems in my marriage.

36:24.747 --> 36:27.620
I just--I don't want
to make it any worse.

36:27.620 --> 36:32.407
Well, I get it,
but I'm just--

36:32.407 --> 36:34.975
I'm just wondering
how you'd feel

36:34.975 --> 36:36.890
if the roles were reversed

36:36.890 --> 36:41.111
and Ben didn't tell you
that he was in a car accident.

36:41.111 --> 36:45.899
Sharon, it's just that, uh--

36:45.899 --> 36:48.989
I can't.
- Look.

36:48.989 --> 36:51.470
Look, give it a little time.

36:51.470 --> 36:54.516
You had a terrible scare today, Maggie.

36:54.516 --> 36:57.867
You don't have to decide
this minute.

36:59.782 --> 37:04.787
Look, I have to go, but
you stay as long as you need.

37:04.787 --> 37:06.180
All right.

37:14.057 --> 37:15.842
Hello, everyone.

37:17.496 --> 37:18.714
Jack, great to see you again.

37:18.714 --> 37:20.238
- Glad you could join us.
- Yeah.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.848
Kathleen, Dennis.

37:21.848 --> 37:23.153
Hey.
- Hey.

37:23.153 --> 37:27.114
So what changed your mind?

37:27.114 --> 37:28.463
Well, I, uh--

37:28.463 --> 37:30.987
I might have been
a little overly concerned

37:30.987 --> 37:32.685
with the optics.

37:32.685 --> 37:35.253
This money could benefit
a lot of people.

37:37.690 --> 37:40.170
Good to see you guys.
How are you?

37:40.170 --> 37:42.347
Thank you.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.262
Well, why don't you
make your ask now?

37:46.220 --> 37:48.222
I just think we can get the
business talk out of the way

37:48.222 --> 37:49.658
so we can enjoy our dinner,

37:49.658 --> 37:52.792
which looks delicious,
by the way.

37:52.792 --> 37:54.228
So what's the ask?

37:54.228 --> 37:55.925
Well, our surgical center

37:55.925 --> 37:58.493
is ranked among the top ten
in the U.S.

37:58.493 --> 38:01.322
Thank you.
We want it in the top five.

38:01.322 --> 38:03.237
We have the best surgeons
in the country,

38:03.237 --> 38:04.804
Dr. Marcel among them,

38:04.804 --> 38:07.459
and what they've been
telling us they need

38:07.459 --> 38:09.461
is updated technology,

38:09.461 --> 38:12.681
starting with
intraoperative MRI machines.

38:12.681 --> 38:15.118
Being able to take imaging
in the middle of a surgery

38:15.118 --> 38:17.860
would allow us to constantly
recalibrate our approach.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.079
It'd be the difference

38:19.079 --> 38:22.561
between being able
to resect 50% of a tumor

38:22.561 --> 38:24.824
and being able
to resect the whole thing.

38:24.824 --> 38:27.783
How much capital
are you looking for?

38:27.783 --> 38:29.742
$10 million.

38:31.526 --> 38:35.704
But of course, we would welcome
a donation of any amount.

38:35.704 --> 38:39.186
No, I think you're
setting your sights too low.

38:39.186 --> 38:43.408
I'm gonna do something
even better for Chicago Med.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.803
Please.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.164
What's all that?

39:01.164 --> 39:03.906
- Buddy's belongings.
- Ah.

39:03.906 --> 39:06.300
The guy he came in with
dropped off a bag.

39:06.300 --> 39:10.086
Stuff he gathered from the spot
where Buddy camped out.

39:10.086 --> 39:12.219
Huh.

39:12.219 --> 39:14.264
Was this him when he was a kid?

39:14.264 --> 39:16.484
- It looks like him, right?
- Yeah.

39:16.484 --> 39:17.877
And that apartment building
in the photo,

39:17.877 --> 39:19.705
that's where we found Buddy
this morning.

39:19.705 --> 39:22.098
He was camping out
in the alley behind it.

39:22.098 --> 39:24.666
I'll be damned.

39:24.666 --> 39:27.930
Figure it's where he grew up?

39:27.930 --> 39:29.845
Yeah.

39:29.845 --> 39:33.109
Maybe I shouldn't have
unpacked everything.

39:33.109 --> 39:36.025
He's only here
to make a move into hospice.

39:36.025 --> 39:38.811
Were you able
to track down any family?

39:38.811 --> 39:39.986
No.

39:42.162 --> 39:48.429
You know, I'd love to put the
blame solely on Dr. Grainer,

39:48.429 --> 39:51.214
but more than one bad actor
failed Buddy.

39:51.214 --> 39:52.781
What do you mean?

39:52.781 --> 39:57.438
He's gonna die from one
of the most survivable cancers.

39:57.438 --> 39:59.440
With early intervention,
this was treatable.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.789
It shouldn't be killing him.

40:03.357 --> 40:06.621
Our system failed Buddy,

40:06.621 --> 40:08.623
and it fails
people just like him every day,

40:08.623 --> 40:09.885
because the people
who need us the most

40:09.885 --> 40:12.018
never even make it
through our doors.

40:13.672 --> 40:14.977
Until it's too late.

40:17.371 --> 40:19.808
When did we decide that's OK?

40:19.808 --> 40:22.985
That that's just the way it is?

40:25.510 --> 40:27.120
It can't be.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.043
I'm not gonna let it.
