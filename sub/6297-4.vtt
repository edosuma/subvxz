00:00.036 --> 00:01.835
<i>Previously on The Borgias...</i>

00:01.937 --> 00:04.105
Giovanni Sforza.

00:04.173 --> 00:06.341
And my cousin,
Catherina Sforza.

00:06.402 --> 00:08.424
You would have a
taste of vengeance.

00:08.492 --> 00:09.995
<i>The king</i>
<i>is on the move.</i>

00:10.063 --> 00:11.330
He says he will
use his cannon

00:11.393 --> 00:13.359
to reduce our
walls to dust.

00:13.428 --> 00:15.860
We fight fire with fire.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.494
You tricked the French King

00:17.562 --> 00:19.461
and now he comes
for our blood!

00:19.528 --> 00:22.129
Do you expect us to
support you twice?

00:23.535 --> 00:24.972
Do you know what this is?

00:25.040 --> 00:27.348
It is the fresco you have so
graciously commissioned.

00:27.415 --> 00:28.715
But it lacks a model.

00:28.783 --> 00:30.184
I would restore this hair

00:30.251 --> 00:32.891
to what it was
before God snatched it from me.

00:32.959 --> 00:34.760
Will we meet again,
Holy Father?

00:34.828 --> 00:36.565
Perhaps.
Am I to be your mistress then?

00:36.666 --> 00:37.633
No.

00:37.734 --> 00:39.101
That position is taken.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.005
We will have you go
through your accounts

00:41.072 --> 00:43.344
with one we have designated
to supervise them.

00:43.413 --> 00:44.981
Unthinkable!

00:45.048 --> 00:46.950
That monies destined to the
poor should go to the poor?

00:47.017 --> 00:50.156
That a woman have access
to curatorial accounts.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.360
<i>The French are</i>
<i>advancing from Naples.</i>

00:52.429 --> 00:55.766
They may murder th
Borgia pe for you.

00:55.834 --> 00:57.367
<i>We would discuss</i>
<i>another cousin</i>

00:57.435 --> 01:00.773
in whose hands the survival
of our papacy may lie.

01:00.841 --> 01:03.310
<i>Your Holiness refers</i>
<i>to the Duke of Milan.</i>

01:03.377 --> 01:05.144
This is true artistry.

01:05.212 --> 01:06.881
Indeed, my lord.
It is but plaster.

01:06.948 --> 01:09.183
There are-
Ninety-five more like it-

01:09.251 --> 01:11.954
making their way from other
foundries as we speak.

01:12.022 --> 01:14.023
You are denied entry
to Rome, my liege.

01:14.091 --> 01:15.793
My cannon will gain me entry.

01:15.861 --> 01:19.030
Perhaps my cannon will make
their statement first.

01:19.098 --> 01:20.331
I warn you!

01:20.399 --> 01:22.033
I shall take terrible revenge!

01:22.134 --> 01:24.135
On you, your family,

01:24.236 --> 01:25.970
and the papacy itself!

01:26.038 --> 01:27.605

03:08.617 --> 03:12.252
So, of what exact
were these cannon made?

03:12.320 --> 03:13.888
Plaster, Your Holiness.

03:13.955 --> 03:15.189
Plaster!

03:15.257 --> 03:17.191
And an armature of wood.
[chuckles]

03:17.259 --> 03:19.727
Senior Vittorio had every
cast maker in Rome at work,

03:19.795 --> 03:20.995
day and night.

03:21.063 --> 03:22.630
We had not the
bronze nor the time.

03:22.731 --> 03:26.567
So, deception has
a place in warfare.

03:26.635 --> 03:29.537
As in life.
Indeed.

03:29.605 --> 03:32.273
If you will excuse me,
Holy Father.

03:36.012 --> 03:37.780
You come to celebrate,
I hope.

03:37.847 --> 03:39.648
The Finch came by
the road from Ostia.

03:39.749 --> 03:41.683
So?

03:41.751 --> 03:44.720
Their path took them by
the convent of St. Cecelia.

03:47.091 --> 03:49.092
You have bad news?

03:49.159 --> 03:51.728
Is there any other kind,
Your Eminence?

Hah! Come on!

04:10.718 --> 04:12.485
We need some blankets.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.587
-have at her.

04:18.894 --> 04:20.795
You should spare yourself this,
Your Eminence.

04:20.863 --> 04:24.232
Why?
Why should I spare myself?

04:26.235 --> 04:29.771
I should have foreseen this.

04:50.492 --> 04:52.159
Your Eminence.

05:06.809 --> 05:08.776
Ursula.

05:22.890 --> 05:27.294
She chose God,
Micheletto.

05:27.362 --> 05:29.964
And God repaid her
with mutilation.

05:30.032 --> 05:33.034
I know little of God,
Your Eminence.

05:33.102 --> 05:36.538
God is deaf, God is blind,
and pitiless.

05:39.308 --> 05:42.477
She has released my heart...

05:42.578 --> 05:44.445
of all emotions but one.

05:48.917 --> 05:50.751
Vengeance.

05:53.388 --> 05:55.289
Vengeance is sweet.

05:57.493 --> 05:59.393
So who did this, my friend?

05:59.494 --> 06:02.263
The French.

06:02.331 --> 06:05.434
This flag belongs to
the cavalry of Gascony.

06:06.836 --> 06:10.072
<i>These women were</i>
<i>sport for army scouts.</i>

06:10.140 --> 06:11.641
Scouts.

06:11.709 --> 06:14.010
They are renowned
for their savagery.

06:14.111 --> 06:16.012
Necklaces
of severed ears.

06:19.284 --> 06:21.819
<i>[distant voice]</i>
<i>...the bodies.</i>

06:21.887 --> 06:27.958
We must give them a
lesson, then, in outrage.

06:28.026 --> 06:30.994
You were once a stray dog,
Micheletto, masterless.

06:31.062 --> 06:32.962
I found my master in you.

06:33.030 --> 06:35.297
There must be other stray
dogs out there in Rome.

06:35.399 --> 06:36.565
There are many.

06:36.666 --> 06:38.366
Sons of warlike families,

06:38.434 --> 06:42.036
condottieri who have long
outlived their usefulness.

06:42.104 --> 06:43.604
Search out a dozen of them

06:43.672 --> 06:46.107
whom we can school in
the art of vengeance.

06:47.943 --> 06:54.048
<i>[bells ringing]</i>

06:55.250 --> 06:56.585
Holy Father.

06:56.686 --> 07:00.222
Ah.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.190
I have heard whispers about
your beautiful deception.

07:02.258 --> 07:04.126
My congratulations.

07:07.063 --> 07:09.631
Deceit is how we must
conduct ourselves, it seems.

07:09.699 --> 07:12.033
Cardinal Sforza brings a
proposition from his cousin,

07:12.101 --> 07:14.669
Ludovico of Milan.

07:14.737 --> 07:18.307
At how the French can be
defeated in open field.

07:18.374 --> 07:20.442
Forgive me for remembering,
Cardinal.

07:20.510 --> 07:22.144
Is this the same
Ludovico Sforza

07:22.211 --> 07:24.579
who gave the French free
passage through Milan?

07:24.681 --> 07:27.649
Ludovico Sforza has
received overtures.

07:27.717 --> 07:30.051
From the doge of Venice.

07:30.152 --> 07:32.653
From Francesco,
the Duke of Mantua.

07:32.721 --> 07:35.556
To form a league to expel
the French from our peninsula.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.024
But your other cousin,
Catherina Sforza,

07:37.091 --> 07:38.525
rides with them.

07:38.593 --> 07:40.027
She has the arms
she needed

07:40.095 --> 07:41.428
and has retired at
her castle at Forli.

07:41.496 --> 07:43.731
And we forgive her
such treachery?

07:43.798 --> 07:45.565
Perhaps.
For the moment.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.101
Priorities can change,
Cardinal Borgia.

07:48.169 --> 07:50.671
Indeed they can.

07:53.608 --> 08:03.049
[cheering]

08:03.117 --> 08:05.518
<i>Welcome to Rome!</i>

08:06.553 --> 08:08.154
<i>Greetings!</i>

[cheering]

09:01.537 --> 09:03.437
What is this?

09:07.109 --> 09:11.045
I have been told by
my friend Micheletto

09:11.113 --> 09:12.447
that you know each
other well enough

09:12.515 --> 09:13.815
to happily hate each other.

09:13.883 --> 09:15.951
I definitely do hate you,
Battista.

09:16.019 --> 09:17.886
You piece of piss,
Orsini.

09:17.954 --> 09:20.856
As a Colonna, I despise you
and your sorry dick.

09:20.924 --> 09:23.793
But there is one you
probably hate more.

09:23.861 --> 09:25.862
Who has ravaged your lands,

09:25.930 --> 09:28.898
your families'
estates, your women,

09:28.965 --> 09:31.267
on their march
to Naples?

09:31.368 --> 09:33.068
The French.

09:33.136 --> 09:35.404
Yes, yes.
The French.

09:35.472 --> 09:37.773
You think we can
defeat an army?

09:37.841 --> 09:39.074
No.

09:39.142 --> 09:40.643
No, my brother tried that
and he failed.

09:40.710 --> 09:43.178
But, but we can
have us some sport.

09:43.246 --> 09:45.080
<i>We can taste revenge.</i>

09:45.148 --> 09:46.748
We can strike them at night

09:46.816 --> 09:49.284
and move like smoke
in the darkness.

09:49.385 --> 09:51.253
Huh?

09:51.321 --> 09:53.088
To what end,
Cardinal?

09:53.190 --> 09:56.158
On your side, booty.

09:56.226 --> 09:59.361
On ours, revenge.

09:59.429 --> 10:03.732
We will ride out,
camouflaged, masked.

10:03.833 --> 10:07.836
No one will know
of our existence.

10:07.937 --> 10:10.639
Any volunteers?

10:18.715 --> 10:20.883
I have broached the
matter of a league

10:20.950 --> 10:22.652
with His Holiness.

10:22.753 --> 10:23.953
He seems receptive.

10:24.021 --> 10:26.356
He can be tempted
into battle?

10:26.424 --> 10:28.992
He can be tempted
by anything-

10:29.060 --> 10:32.062
that gets him out
of those papal robes.

10:37.336 --> 10:39.271
[clears throat]

10:44.244 --> 10:45.845
[exhales]

10:53.619 --> 10:56.487
Your Holiness,
may I introduce my cousin,

10:56.588 --> 10:59.757
Ludovico Sforza,
the Duke of Milan?

11:07.132 --> 11:08.499
Your Holiness,

11:08.567 --> 11:11.136
may I introduce
Francesco Gonzaga,

11:11.203 --> 11:15.306
Duke of Mantua, and
his new minted bride,

11:15.374 --> 11:18.009
the lovely Duchessa Bianca.

11:41.937 --> 11:44.305
Divine indeed.

11:48.510 --> 11:49.977
Do diplomatic affairs

11:50.045 --> 11:53.213
not bore you rigid,
Duchessa?

11:53.281 --> 11:56.583
They do, Your Holiness,

11:56.650 --> 12:00.019
but my husband's affections
more than compensate.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.524
Ah.

12:04.591 --> 12:07.494
<i>[door opens]</i>

12:19.842 --> 12:21.810
<i>If I may be so bold,</i>
<i>Your Holiness,</i>

12:21.878 --> 12:24.880
we have all of us one
thing in common today.

12:24.947 --> 12:26.948
What, suspicion?
Of each other?

12:27.016 --> 12:28.416
Or is it hatred?

12:28.484 --> 12:30.318
If the cardinal will
let me finish...

12:30.419 --> 12:31.786
Indeed.

12:31.854 --> 12:33.688
The cardinal would find
how hatred turns to love.

12:33.755 --> 12:35.156
My son!

12:35.224 --> 12:37.224
The French have laid
waste to the papal states

12:37.291 --> 12:38.992
as they march northwards.

12:39.060 --> 12:42.429
Their king intends
leave a desert behind him.

12:42.496 --> 12:44.264
<i>By the time he reaches Milan,</i>

12:44.331 --> 12:47.434
there will be nothing left
of this paradise we live in.

12:47.502 --> 12:49.203
So why did you
welcome them in?

12:49.271 --> 12:52.840
Our proposal is that the
armies of Venice, of Milan,

12:52.908 --> 12:55.610
of the Duke of
Mantua will combine

12:55.678 --> 12:58.447
to rid us of this
French plague.

12:58.515 --> 13:00.082
<i>Twenty thousand of our troops</i>

13:00.150 --> 13:01.718
<i>will meet them</i>
<i>near the Apennines.</i>

13:01.785 --> 13:03.687
We will annihilate their army

13:03.755 --> 13:05.889
and restore the reputation
of Tuscan valour.

13:05.957 --> 13:08.591
Tuscan?
<i>And Milanese.</i>

13:08.659 --> 13:10.627
Not to speak of Roman.

13:10.694 --> 13:11.994
Under whose leadership?

13:12.062 --> 13:14.164
Under the leadership
of Francesco Gonzaga,

13:14.232 --> 13:15.798
Duke of Mantua.

13:15.866 --> 13:17.534
<i>With the blessing</i>
<i>of His Holiness,</i>

13:17.601 --> 13:19.169
<i>the Pope of Rome.</i>

13:19.237 --> 13:21.538
His Holiness has
proved his courage

13:21.606 --> 13:23.507
to the whole of Italy.

13:23.574 --> 13:26.243
And the whole of Italy
will rally to his cause.

13:26.311 --> 13:27.779
Then why not just
let the French

13:27.846 --> 13:29.080
limp their way home?

13:29.148 --> 13:31.616
One word.
Honour.

13:31.717 --> 13:33.118
Honour?

13:33.186 --> 13:37.089
The word meant something once,
did it not?

13:44.098 --> 13:45.532
talks of honour, Father.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.767
There is nothing-

13:46.834 --> 13:49.102
Interesting concept
honour, isn't it?

13:49.203 --> 13:51.537
Like its cousin, valour.

13:51.605 --> 13:53.139
Honour has cousins?

13:53.206 --> 13:54.707
Oh, many cousins.

13:54.775 --> 13:57.175
Like Cardinal Sforza?

13:57.243 --> 14:01.713
And they've all led kings
and armies to their doom.

14:01.814 --> 14:02.947
So why we should now

14:03.015 --> 14:04.682
make common cause
with Milan?

14:04.750 --> 14:09.621
Because, when the French have
left this fair paradise,

14:09.688 --> 14:12.190
the Milanese will
still be with us.

14:12.258 --> 14:15.326
So?

14:15.394 --> 14:22.000
This league cannot
beat the French...

14:23.202 --> 14:25.236
even in their weakened state.

14:25.304 --> 14:29.673
And I doubt the French
can beat this league.

14:29.740 --> 14:34.977
So if the two armies batter
each other to death,

14:35.045 --> 14:36.712
as the lawyers
often say,

14:36.780 --> 14:38.781
cui bono?

14:38.848 --> 14:41.617
Who benefits?
Mm.

14:41.684 --> 14:45.287
A weakened Milan,
a weakened Venice,

14:45.388 --> 14:48.024
a weakened Mantua-

14:49.726 --> 14:53.096
has to be worth a weekend
in Tuscany, surely?

14:53.164 --> 14:59.003
[chuckles]

14:59.070 --> 15:06.910
<i>[bells ringing]</i>

15:08.280 --> 15:10.180
Stately.

15:16.588 --> 15:18.855
Where is he?

15:18.956 --> 15:21.758
He must be here somewhere.

15:22.759 --> 15:24.760
I hear you before I see you.

15:24.828 --> 15:29.766
[grunting]

15:29.833 --> 15:32.535
Yes?

15:32.603 --> 15:35.572
You line your
scabbard with cotton.

15:41.445 --> 15:43.346
You want the French
to hear you coming?

15:43.414 --> 15:45.015
Lose your spurs.
All of you.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.483
And wear only soft leather.

15:46.551 --> 15:47.818
Understood?

15:47.886 --> 15:50.588
<i>Condottieri!</i>
<i>Come.</i>

15:53.092 --> 15:55.494
<i>When the scouts ride</i>
<i>ahead of the French army,</i>

15:55.595 --> 15:57.396
we'll be waiting for them.

15:59.066 --> 16:02.102
We have the light crossbow,

16:06.808 --> 16:08.408
the Spanish garrotte,

16:12.514 --> 16:14.748
the trident,

16:17.852 --> 16:19.519
the paso doble.

16:21.990 --> 16:23.224
Raven's beak.

16:23.325 --> 16:24.658
<i>With weapons like these,</i>

16:24.726 --> 16:26.860
we can reinvent combat.

16:26.928 --> 16:29.863
<i>Now there is talk</i>
<i>of a pitched battle.</i>

16:29.964 --> 16:31.865
Of something called honour.

16:36.237 --> 16:38.405
Let us show them another way.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.843
Should His Holiness not
be fitted in armour?

16:45.412 --> 16:47.813
We fight the wars
of God, not of man.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.649
Then why travel
with the league?

16:49.716 --> 16:51.617
There will be war,
surely.

16:51.685 --> 16:53.953
They would have
<i>our blessing.</i>

16:56.123 --> 16:58.591
You could have
given it by proxy.

16:58.659 --> 17:01.294
But the dead will have
to be prayed over

17:01.361 --> 17:03.528
Mm.

17:03.596 --> 17:05.497
I know you, Holy Father,

17:10.236 --> 17:13.404
and know you always
have many ends in view.

17:15.140 --> 17:17.375
Perhaps.

17:17.442 --> 17:20.344
If the armies of men will
annihilate each other,

17:20.444 --> 17:22.445
what will be left?

17:22.546 --> 17:24.847
The army of God.

17:26.683 --> 17:29.152
I would beg your
permission, then,

17:29.253 --> 17:31.020
in your absence,

17:31.088 --> 17:34.057
to investigate the office
of public works even further.

17:34.158 --> 17:36.292
For more irregularities?

17:36.360 --> 17:39.228
There are so many,
Holy Father,

17:39.296 --> 17:40.963
in this Vatican of yours.

17:42.098 --> 17:43.899
Yes.

17:46.770 --> 17:52.308
[indistinct voices]

17:52.376 --> 17:53.944
[panting]

17:54.011 --> 17:56.313
The army's about 30 miles
south, moving slowly.

17:56.381 --> 17:57.948
And the Gascon scouts?

17:58.016 --> 17:59.684
Only about ten miles,
at the most.

17:59.751 --> 18:01.519
Checking the army's route.

18:01.587 --> 18:02.887
They ride hard.

18:02.955 --> 18:04.956
They will be hungry.

18:05.023 --> 18:06.590
Condottieri!
Let's go.

18:06.658 --> 18:08.158
Up, up.

18:08.259 --> 18:09.993
The French are coming!

18:10.094 --> 18:11.495
<i>They're coming!</i>

18:11.562 --> 18:14.363
People!
Make ready!

18:14.431 --> 18:16.698
They're coming!
<i>Hurry!</i>

18:16.766 --> 18:18.800
<i>Get the children!</i>

18:18.868 --> 18:26.808
<i>[indistinct shouting]</i>

18:28.845 --> 18:30.713
Tuer tout le monde!

18:36.820 --> 18:40.824
The voile libre.

18:40.892 --> 18:43.093
There's nobody here!

18:45.363 --> 18:46.730
A wedding party.

18:46.831 --> 18:48.731
Without a bride.

18:48.799 --> 18:50.366
The party has moved on.

18:50.434 --> 18:52.501
No brides.
No bridesmaids.

18:52.569 --> 18:54.738
No nuns.
[laughter]

18:54.805 --> 18:57.808
They've heard about the size
of your dick, Sherat.

18:57.909 --> 18:59.810
Let's eat.

18:59.878 --> 19:02.179
[laughter and chatter]

19:02.246 --> 19:03.914
-Girls!

19:04.015 --> 19:06.916
Give me some more!

19:10.188 --> 19:11.721
Drink it!

19:12.823 --> 19:14.558
<i>Et tu, mon-</i>

19:22.134 --> 19:23.901
<i>Allez!</i>

19:34.878 --> 19:36.379
On your feet!

19:39.149 --> 19:41.817
<i>[shouting]</i>

19:47.923 --> 19:49.724
French dog!

19:54.730 --> 19:56.563
<i>Show some restraint,</i>
<i>gentlemen.</i>

19:56.631 --> 19:58.265
<i>I want these men alive.</i>

20:02.937 --> 20:04.838
With their colours.

20:05.974 --> 20:07.841
They have a tale to tell.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.851
These children
need an orphanage.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.253
They do indeed,

20:21.321 --> 20:23.188
but the nunneries that
used to care for them

20:23.256 --> 20:25.424
are starved of funds.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.993
And the orphanage
on Piazza Navona

20:27.060 --> 20:29.462
is now a cardinal's palace.

20:32.466 --> 20:33.867
Here once stood statue

20:33.968 --> 20:36.370
of the Goddess Sulis Minerva.

20:36.438 --> 20:39.307
And here flowed
crystal spring water

20:39.374 --> 20:41.910
from the Alban Hills...

20:41.977 --> 20:44.379
Statues are easily restored.

20:44.447 --> 20:47.415
Water is not.

20:47.483 --> 20:52.587
So, I would use
my wit-and yours-

20:52.654 --> 20:56.190
to outwit those who
divert funds-and water-

20:56.258 --> 20:58.758
from poorhouses to palaces.

20:58.826 --> 21:01.761
Cardinals-in the curia.

21:01.829 --> 21:05.131
You are far too clever.

21:05.232 --> 21:06.699
It would be fun

21:06.800 --> 21:09.970
to outwit a brace
of cardinals.

21:10.071 --> 21:11.672
More than fun.

21:11.773 --> 21:14.475
It could save lives.

21:14.543 --> 21:17.612
And there is one more brain
I would engage in our cause.

21:17.713 --> 21:19.280
Your mother's.

21:19.348 --> 21:21.483
My mother?
But she-

21:21.551 --> 21:22.785
You must admit,

21:22.852 --> 21:26.188
three minds will
be better than two.

21:26.256 --> 21:29.858
And your mother and I
are far beyond such enmities.

21:30.927 --> 21:32.427
[chuckles]

21:38.768 --> 21:40.135
Whose idea was this?

21:40.236 --> 21:41.870
Mine.

21:41.971 --> 21:43.238
And you concurred?

21:43.305 --> 21:44.705
We would use your wit,
Mother.

21:44.773 --> 21:45.873
And your wisdom.

21:45.974 --> 21:48.676
I find myself lacking in both.

21:48.744 --> 21:51.646
We have plans for
the Roman poor.

21:51.714 --> 21:54.248
We've already restored
one bathhouse.

21:54.316 --> 21:56.718
And the Holy Father

21:56.786 --> 21:57.986
has given me full
authority to-

21:58.054 --> 22:00.121
Your lover.

22:00.188 --> 22:03.658
And yours.

22:03.726 --> 22:06.561
Given you full
authority for what?

22:06.629 --> 22:09.198
To comb through the
curatorial accounts.

22:09.265 --> 22:13.503
He knows a lot about
combing through accounts.

22:13.570 --> 22:16.673
And if you would catch
a cardinal or two,

22:16.740 --> 22:20.443
you do well to ask one
who was a courtesan.

22:21.679 --> 22:26.182
However distasteful this may
sound to you, my daughter,

22:26.283 --> 22:31.187
and to you, la bella Farnese,

22:31.254 --> 22:33.723
you will have to
acquaint yourselves

22:33.824 --> 22:36.625
with the brothels of Rome.

23:02.185 --> 23:03.518
[spits]

23:09.092 --> 23:12.193
You know these colours?

23:14.497 --> 23:17.098
[shouts]
Do you know these colours!

23:17.166 --> 23:20.535
They are the colours
of our regiment.

23:20.602 --> 23:22.236
Good answer.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.342
You know where
this was found?

23:30.679 --> 23:31.946
[crying]

23:32.014 --> 23:35.817
It was found on the
site of a massacre.

23:35.885 --> 23:39.722
I cannot... speak...
my lord.

23:43.460 --> 23:45.862
[rapid breathing]

23:45.930 --> 23:50.533
And these ears cannot hear.

23:50.601 --> 23:53.002
You collect them as trophies?

23:58.175 --> 24:01.243
A convent would have
provided quite a harvest,

24:01.311 --> 24:04.213
would it not?
[whimpering]

24:04.314 --> 24:07.016
<i>St. Cecilia's.</i>

24:07.083 --> 24:08.718
Who was there?

24:08.785 --> 24:10.920
I know not, my lord.

24:10.988 --> 24:12.923
There are many
in our regiment.

24:13.024 --> 24:14.825
If I am to die, my lord,

24:14.926 --> 24:17.127
I would prefer to die quickly.

24:17.228 --> 24:20.097
What?
Who speaks of dying?

24:20.198 --> 24:21.766
My associate is a master!

24:21.833 --> 24:23.934
He can keep you
alive for weeks!

24:26.037 --> 24:30.106
In a universe of pain.

24:30.174 --> 24:33.476
But the truth might
yet set you free.

24:33.544 --> 24:36.379
The convent!
Who was there?

24:38.749 --> 24:41.483
Who partook?

24:43.353 --> 24:44.953
Nothing?

24:45.054 --> 24:46.722
Show us, Micheletto.

24:46.789 --> 24:48.657
Your expertise.

24:49.660 --> 24:54.364
[whimpering]

24:54.432 --> 24:55.932
He was there!

24:56.000 --> 24:57.868
You lying bastard,

24:59.704 --> 25:02.572
It was your idea!

25:02.640 --> 25:05.910
He said there was
sport to be had.

25:05.978 --> 25:09.847
In a place that had
your own protection.

25:09.948 --> 25:11.849
What?

25:11.917 --> 25:14.118
And who told him that?

25:16.689 --> 25:17.755
More.

25:17.857 --> 25:19.124
[whimpering]

25:19.225 --> 25:20.758
Giovanni!

25:22.428 --> 25:24.329
The Lord Sforza!

25:24.397 --> 25:26.331
[crying]

25:29.101 --> 25:31.036
So I must punish him then.

25:37.044 --> 25:38.778
My associate may
yet prove merciful.

25:38.846 --> 25:40.580
He treasures information.

25:40.648 --> 25:43.416
Do you not Micheletto?

25:43.484 --> 25:46.586
If it proves true,
Your Eminence, yes.

25:46.654 --> 25:48.521
The truth then-

25:48.589 --> 25:53.526
on troop movements,
booty, cannon-

25:53.594 --> 25:55.861
may yet set you free.

26:18.785 --> 26:22.588
Would you keep
secrets from us?

26:22.656 --> 26:24.490
Why do you ask?

26:24.558 --> 26:26.693
We have heard rumours.

26:26.761 --> 26:28.995
Of skirmishes at night.

26:29.097 --> 26:30.330
Warfare.

26:30.431 --> 26:32.400
I would call it vengeance,
Father.

26:32.468 --> 26:33.735
Not warfare.

26:33.802 --> 26:36.271
You are a cleric,
not a soldier.

26:36.372 --> 26:37.606
Then, yes.

26:37.707 --> 26:39.775
I have a secret.

26:42.279 --> 26:44.247
The whole of Rome
is whispering.

26:47.251 --> 26:51.153
Of our dark son.

26:51.221 --> 26:55.523
So let us instruct you
in the art of vengeance.

26:55.591 --> 26:57.092
Do I need lessons?

26:57.193 --> 26:59.627
Perhaps.

26:59.728 --> 27:04.799
Vengeance should
never be seen as that.

27:04.900 --> 27:07.869
It should always
be unexpected.

27:07.937 --> 27:10.372
And it should
rarely be public.

27:10.473 --> 27:12.641
You learnt this from the Lord?

27:12.709 --> 27:16.846
We know little of war,
but much of vengeance.

27:16.913 --> 27:18.447
And the one salient
point is this:

27:18.515 --> 27:20.683
vengeance is patient.

27:20.751 --> 27:23.620
It can wait a
lifetime if necessary.

27:23.721 --> 27:26.623
Because it never dies.

27:26.690 --> 27:28.525
If you care to
ride north with us,

27:28.592 --> 27:29.926
you may see what we mean.

27:32.063 --> 27:33.463
So who will maintain
the house of God

27:33.531 --> 27:34.797
in our absence?

27:34.865 --> 27:36.866
The vice chancellor,
perhaps?

27:36.934 --> 27:40.369
No, Cardinal Sforza
must ride with us.

27:41.638 --> 27:42.904
You mistrust him
that much?

27:44.240 --> 27:47.809
Our distrust of
the vice chancellor

27:47.911 --> 27:49.344
is bottomless.

27:51.348 --> 27:54.284
As of the entire curia.

27:54.351 --> 27:56.253
Which is why we thought
we would leave them

27:56.320 --> 28:00.725
in the safe hands of
that one blessed person

28:00.826 --> 28:03.160
in whom we can utterly,

28:03.228 --> 28:05.630
utterly place our trust.

28:16.541 --> 28:18.843
[chuckling]

28:29.821 --> 28:32.290
Show me your hands, Cesare.

28:36.062 --> 28:37.897
Is it true what I've heard?

28:37.965 --> 28:41.201
That they are
stained with blood?

28:41.268 --> 28:43.503
Must I confess to you?
[kisses]

28:44.772 --> 28:46.006
No.

28:48.442 --> 28:52.278
But we never before had
secrets between us.

28:52.345 --> 28:55.848
Some things are
better left unsaid.

28:55.916 --> 28:58.284
So I must divine then...

28:58.351 --> 29:00.986
the dark cloud on
my brother's soul.

29:01.054 --> 29:03.122
Are you a shepherd
of souls now?

29:04.724 --> 29:07.759
And I see before
me a lost sheep.

29:08.995 --> 29:11.730
Utterly lost, my love.

29:11.797 --> 29:15.667
Then by hook or by crook,

29:15.768 --> 29:17.202
I shall save you.

29:19.906 --> 29:21.673
You may kiss my ring.

29:21.740 --> 29:25.877
[murmuring]

29:34.019 --> 29:38.022
You may sit, cardinals.

29:38.090 --> 29:40.058
May I sit too, Sister?

29:40.126 --> 29:41.860
Indeed, Cardinal Borgia.

29:43.362 --> 29:45.096
Forgive our haste,
your Eminences

29:45.164 --> 29:46.965
but our preparations
are endless.

29:47.066 --> 29:48.333
You will have heard;

29:48.401 --> 29:49.767
we have been
called to the north

29:49.835 --> 29:53.638
where the dogs of war
are once again barking.

29:53.706 --> 29:57.142
We must take the
vice chancellor

29:57.209 --> 30:01.346
and Cardinal Borgia with us.

30:01.380 --> 30:04.216
And your prayers
would be welcome.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.154
We have signed a bull,

30:09.222 --> 30:12.958
leaving our dear daughter in,

30:13.059 --> 30:16.327
so to speak, loco parentis.

30:16.429 --> 30:19.330
Are there any questions?

30:19.431 --> 30:20.898
Cardinal Versucci?

30:20.966 --> 30:22.633
Can a woman,
Your Holiness,

30:22.701 --> 30:25.135
occupy the chair
of St. Peter?

30:25.203 --> 30:28.872
Well, plainly, one does.

30:28.973 --> 30:31.074
Pax nobiscum.

30:31.141 --> 30:33.509
Dominus nobiscum.

30:45.087 --> 30:51.928
[crying]

30:51.995 --> 30:55.699
He is ready to impart
information, Eminence.

30:55.766 --> 30:57.768
Only to you.

30:57.836 --> 30:59.636
Why me?

30:59.704 --> 31:01.972
Because I know what
his pleasures are.

31:06.111 --> 31:09.414
Tell me.

31:09.481 --> 31:12.250
The powder...

31:12.318 --> 31:14.919
for the king's cannon.

31:14.987 --> 31:16.921
Yes.
Tell me.

31:16.989 --> 31:20.090
Travels in the
kitchen wagons

31:20.158 --> 31:25.262
disguised as
barrels of food.

31:25.330 --> 31:27.898
And without that powder,

31:27.999 --> 31:30.968
their cannon are useless.

31:31.035 --> 31:34.806
As am I, Your Eminence.

31:47.154 --> 31:49.055
Release him.

31:52.459 --> 31:55.195
<i>[door opens]</i>

31:55.263 --> 31:56.830
<i>[removes blade]</i>

32:23.357 --> 32:25.926

32:30.932 --> 32:37.471

32:59.360 --> 33:00.594
<i>Bless us,</i>
<i>Your Holiness!</i>

33:00.662 --> 33:01.995
<i>Take pity,</i>
<i>Your Holiness!</i>

33:02.063 --> 33:05.299
May God protect you,
<i>Holy Father!</i>

33:05.400 --> 33:06.934
Safe journey!

33:07.001 --> 33:10.937
In nomini Patris, et
Filli et Spiritus Sancti.

33:15.610 --> 33:17.244
Have you heard?

33:17.312 --> 33:20.580
He's left his daughter in
the chair of St. Peter's.

33:20.648 --> 33:22.416
We must travel
to Florence then.

33:22.484 --> 33:24.218
Talk to our brother
Savanarola.

33:24.285 --> 33:26.052
Surely this man cannot
be allowed to live.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.587
<i>Blessings, Your Holiness!</i>

33:32.693 --> 33:39.765
<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

33:41.801 --> 33:45.003
We would give the
consistory a lesson...

33:50.678 --> 33:51.678
...in cookery.

33:51.779 --> 33:53.680
<i>[laughter]</i>

33:53.781 --> 33:56.516
Or is that husbandry?

33:59.888 --> 34:02.924
Baking a cake.

34:02.992 --> 34:05.760
[murmuring]

34:05.828 --> 34:10.231
Pour the flour into a sieve.

34:10.299 --> 34:14.235
Shake, gently.

34:14.335 --> 34:19.507
The good flour emerges.

34:19.608 --> 34:22.775
The chaff remains.

34:24.045 --> 34:26.413
Am I correct,
Cardinal Versucci?

34:26.480 --> 34:29.516
I know little of
cookery, my lady.

34:29.617 --> 34:31.784
But you eat cake, surely?

34:31.853 --> 34:33.321
Indeed.

34:34.857 --> 34:37.192
I would hazard that
the entire consistory

34:37.260 --> 34:43.433
has been known at times to
indulge in its sweet tooth.

34:43.534 --> 34:47.235
To eat said cake.

34:47.304 --> 34:49.605
Is there perhaps
a metaphor here?

34:53.143 --> 34:55.344
That the curia,

34:55.411 --> 34:58.247
its various offices,
devoted to public works,

34:58.348 --> 35:01.317
acts like a sieve.

35:01.385 --> 35:04.086
The good flour emerges.

35:04.188 --> 35:05.988
And whats left?

35:06.089 --> 35:09.992
For the poor, the needy?

35:10.093 --> 35:11.260
The chaff.

35:11.328 --> 35:13.162
[murmuring]

35:13.230 --> 35:18.634
And what element do we lack
to make this cake?

35:21.571 --> 35:23.072
Ahh!

35:23.173 --> 35:26.609
[murmuring]

35:26.677 --> 35:28.444
Water.

35:31.915 --> 35:33.616
[children squealing]

35:33.717 --> 35:39.889
[laughing, shouting]

35:39.891 --> 35:47.229
[laughing, shouting]

35:57.607 --> 36:02.010
[soldier shouting]

36:02.078 --> 36:03.545
Soldiers approaching!

36:03.613 --> 36:05.347
Attention!

36:08.351 --> 36:09.818
Father.

36:12.689 --> 36:14.924
Why have we stopped?

36:20.164 --> 36:21.464
The King of France,
Your Holiness,

36:21.565 --> 36:23.099
has requested an audience.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.901
He awaits your presence-
alone-

36:25.002 --> 36:27.003
in a church nearby.

36:41.417 --> 36:44.652
<i>We are ill,</i>
<i>Your Holiness.</i>

36:44.720 --> 36:48.757
This battle may
well be our last.

36:48.825 --> 36:51.927
Which is why
we have requested

36:52.028 --> 36:54.331
a private audience.

36:54.398 --> 36:57.200
Not for your
confession?

36:59.537 --> 37:02.940
My sins are many,
Your Holiness.

37:03.041 --> 37:05.743
And they are
all bloody ones.

37:05.811 --> 37:08.646
Perhaps even
the Pope of Rome

37:08.747 --> 37:11.849
cannot forgive them.

37:11.917 --> 37:15.220
So why have you requested
our presence here?

37:15.321 --> 37:18.823
To use your diplomatic skills

37:18.890 --> 37:21.024
to spare us this battle.

37:23.528 --> 37:25.128
Well, perhaps if you would

37:25.196 --> 37:28.265
surrender the booty
you have pillaged

37:28.332 --> 37:32.102
to our Holy Mother Church,

37:32.170 --> 37:36.141
we might do something.

37:36.208 --> 37:37.776
With respect, Your Holiness,

37:37.877 --> 37:41.012
you have fooled me once.

37:41.080 --> 37:42.748
For a man of God,

37:42.815 --> 37:48.387
yours was a most
ungodly stratagem.

37:49.756 --> 37:53.926
So, why our presence?

37:55.128 --> 37:58.597
If they are fool enough
to join battle with me,

37:58.665 --> 38:01.767
I will destroy them, utterly.

38:01.835 --> 38:03.202
I will be pitiless.

38:03.270 --> 38:04.904
I know no other way.

38:04.972 --> 38:08.041
My cannon will
annihilate their armies!

38:08.108 --> 38:10.910
The dead will be numberless!

38:10.978 --> 38:13.847
I will drag you in
chains to Avignon

38:13.915 --> 38:18.485
and see you end your
days in ignominy!

38:18.553 --> 38:20.854
All this before I die!

38:20.922 --> 38:23.924
Are you listening,
Holy Father?

38:23.992 --> 38:28.329
<i>[distant thunder]</i>

38:30.632 --> 38:34.067
We hear you.

38:34.135 --> 38:38.071
We will convey your words
to the league forces.

38:40.876 --> 38:44.411
<i>[rain falling]</i>
<i>Ah, listen.</i>

38:44.479 --> 38:48.148
Is that the sound of rain?

38:48.249 --> 38:51.485
Can even the King of France

38:51.552 --> 38:55.121
light his cannon in the rain?

38:55.189 --> 38:56.622
You think we don't know

38:56.690 --> 38:59.258
how to keep powder dry?

39:00.694 --> 39:04.597
Do you think the Lord God
doesn't know how to make rain?

39:11.973 --> 39:13.674
The French have deployed
their cannon here

39:13.742 --> 39:15.042
along this ridge.

39:15.110 --> 39:16.443
We, however,
have the advantage

39:16.511 --> 39:18.679
of this higher ridge here.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.715
From which we shall attack.

39:22.885 --> 39:23.952
<i>All right, man.</i>

39:24.020 --> 39:25.420
<i>Put it with the other -</i>

39:25.488 --> 39:26.454
The rain has stopped.

39:26.555 --> 39:27.889
All off the wagon!

39:27.956 --> 39:29.924
Beg pardon, Your Holiness?

39:29.992 --> 39:32.427
Would not rain
help your cause?

39:32.494 --> 39:34.863
Armies can fight in the rain.

39:34.931 --> 39:37.499
But would it not
hinder their cannon?

39:37.566 --> 39:39.200
Rain is not a
friend to gunpowder.

39:39.268 --> 39:42.170
We do not fear their cannon, Holy Father.
No?

39:42.237 --> 39:44.138
Perhaps you should.

39:44.206 --> 39:46.908
The King of France
requested an audience.

39:46.975 --> 39:48.543
He asks to be let free

39:48.644 --> 39:50.746
to continue his march home.

39:50.814 --> 39:54.150
But if forced to fight,
he promises carnage

39:54.218 --> 39:56.920
the like of which none
of us has yet seen.

39:56.988 --> 40:00.157
We are here to spill blood,
Your Holiness.

40:00.225 --> 40:04.329
Yours?
Or theirs?

40:04.396 --> 40:07.465
I would beg the Holy Father

40:07.533 --> 40:10.001
to give these
troops his blessing

40:10.069 --> 40:12.137
who may well die tomorrow.

40:12.205 --> 40:15.507
And to hear what may well
be my last confession.

40:15.575 --> 40:20.079
And to retire to my castle
before the battle commences,

40:20.146 --> 40:23.615
lest any harm come
to his sacred person.

40:25.585 --> 40:27.719
I have bloodied my hands
in battle.

40:27.820 --> 40:29.121
I have killed;

40:29.189 --> 40:31.657
I have sent countless
men to their doom.

40:31.725 --> 40:34.194
And I pray that God sees
the justice of our cause

40:34.261 --> 40:35.762
and forgives me
for our sins.

40:35.830 --> 40:39.033
The Church acknowledges
some wars are just.

40:39.100 --> 40:41.535
Does your conscience tell you
that this is one such?

40:41.603 --> 40:43.070
It does, Your Holiness.

40:43.138 --> 40:45.539
It will restore the
valour of Italian arms.

40:45.607 --> 40:47.041
The honour of our soldiery.

40:47.109 --> 40:50.077
Honour and valour alone
cannot justify warfare.

40:50.145 --> 40:52.713
But I would plead just cause,
Your Holiness.

40:52.781 --> 40:54.481
The weight of booty
they carry with them

40:54.549 --> 40:56.884
gives ample evidence of
their greed and perfidy.

40:56.952 --> 40:59.487
For this reason alone,
I would seek your blessing.

40:59.588 --> 41:01.022
And your forgiveness.

41:02.858 --> 41:05.761
Do you pledge your arms
to the service of God,

41:05.828 --> 41:07.196
and his vicar on earth?

41:07.297 --> 41:08.630
I do, Your Holiness.

41:08.698 --> 41:10.566
And do you promise
to fight in His name

41:10.634 --> 41:11.668
and His name alone?

41:11.735 --> 41:13.203
I do, Your Holiness.

41:13.270 --> 41:17.408
And do you pledge the spoils
of battle in its entirety

41:17.475 --> 41:19.476
to His Holy Mother Church?

41:23.349 --> 41:26.952
God's blessing
comes with a price.

41:29.388 --> 41:31.223
I-do, Your Holiness.

41:32.425 --> 41:35.292
Then you have our blessing.

41:35.393 --> 41:39.396
Attention!

41:40.398 --> 41:45.101
In nomineatris et
Filli et Spiritus Sancti.

41:45.169 --> 41:47.604
Amen.

41:47.671 --> 41:53.042
In nomine Patris et
Filli et Spiritus Sancti.

41:53.143 --> 41:55.244
Amen.

41:55.312 --> 42:01.217
In nomine Patris et
Filli et Spiritus Sancti.

42:01.285 --> 42:04.287
Amen.

42:04.354 --> 42:09.392
In nomine Patris et
Filli et Spiritus Sancti.

42:25.744 --> 42:27.878
Your Holiness.
Duches.

42:35.186 --> 42:39.755
So, life has treated you well.

42:39.823 --> 42:42.758
When you gave me
your blessing,

42:42.826 --> 42:44.560
I had not yet et my husband.

42:44.627 --> 42:45.961
No.

42:46.029 --> 42:47.763
And now is it we who
are to be blessed

42:47.831 --> 42:50.032
with your hospitality.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.135
So it would seem,
Your Holiness.

42:55.941 --> 43:00.345
I have not yet
forgotten those times.

43:03.082 --> 43:08.154
Some memories endure then?

43:08.255 --> 43:11.691
So it would seem.

43:13.427 --> 43:15.995
We thank God for His
blessings upon this table,

43:16.063 --> 43:18.231
and in this household.

43:18.299 --> 43:19.799
We ask Him

43:19.867 --> 43:23.636
to watch over the Lord
Gonzaga, and his League,

43:23.704 --> 43:26.606
and we pray for the
benediction of rain

43:26.707 --> 43:30.042
upon the field of
battle tomorrow.

43:30.110 --> 43:31.444
Amen.

43:36.183 --> 43:38.885
Is my husband's survival
dependent on rain?

43:38.986 --> 43:41.554
<i>And on valour too.</i>

43:41.655 --> 43:42.822
Your husband, madame,

43:42.890 --> 43:45.692
is a condottieri
of the old school.

43:45.759 --> 43:47.693
He believes warfare
to be an art.

43:47.761 --> 43:49.528
Cannon a vulgarity.

43:51.331 --> 43:53.699
Let us hope it's
not a tragic art.

43:53.767 --> 43:55.234
So we pray then for a downpour

43:55.302 --> 43:57.002
to disarm their cannon.

44:22.731 --> 44:24.732
[indistinct praying]

44:28.904 --> 44:30.939
Micheletto.
Your Eminence.

44:31.007 --> 44:32.640
Condottieri!
Let's ride!

44:35.243 --> 44:36.911
Yah! Yah!

44:40.983 --> 44:42.550
[mouthing prayer]

44:45.621 --> 44:47.889
Forgive me, Holy Father.

44:47.956 --> 44:49.924
You are at prayer.

44:52.394 --> 44:54.762
No, you cannot.

44:54.864 --> 44:56.731
I am afraid I must.

44:59.801 --> 45:04.704
But on...
on a night such as this...

45:04.772 --> 45:07.574
I have unfinished business
with the Holy Father.

45:07.641 --> 45:09.842
You now have a husband.

45:09.910 --> 45:11.811
And you have a mistress.

45:11.879 --> 45:13.846
But your husband
fights tomorrow.

45:13.914 --> 45:16.281
No...

45:18.918 --> 45:20.818
So let me pray with you.

45:20.886 --> 45:22.453
For rain.

45:24.189 --> 45:26.357

47:15.404 --> 47:19.607
Thunder.

47:19.708 --> 47:23.077
And after thunder comes...

47:23.178 --> 47:24.946
The deluge.

47:25.014 --> 47:27.516
The deluge...

<i>[shouting]</i>

Were your prayers answered?

No, no, no.
Listen.

47:57.747 --> 47:59.848
For what?

47:59.916 --> 48:03.085
There is no sound
of French cannon.

<i>[loud rainfall] Thank you, God!
Thank you!</i>

48:19.100 --> 48:22.002

Bless you, my sons.

48:36.483 --> 48:37.916
So many dead!

48:40.787 --> 48:42.988
So much glory.

48:48.761 --> 48:49.828
Right man.

48:49.896 --> 48:51.163
Pull it out.

48:51.231 --> 48:52.831
Ah!
Ooh.

48:56.369 --> 48:58.537
These wounds, Your Holiness,

48:58.604 --> 49:00.906
are proof that
valour lives still.

49:00.974 --> 49:02.875
Ah, indeed.

49:02.942 --> 49:04.777
And honour, no doubt.
<i>It was a battle</i>

49:04.844 --> 49:07.946
from the pages
of Ariosto.

49:08.014 --> 49:11.450
And God answered our prayers
with a voice of thunder.

49:13.286 --> 49:15.454
There were explosions
last night,

49:15.521 --> 49:17.456
Holy Father,
but no thunder.

49:17.524 --> 49:19.992
Well,
I heard thunder,

49:20.059 --> 49:21.260
followed by
torrential rain,

49:21.327 --> 49:23.529
which drowned their cannon.

49:23.596 --> 49:26.464
The French munitions
were destroyed.

49:26.565 --> 49:27.999
But not by thunder.

49:29.635 --> 49:32.303
By some brave Roman souls.

49:32.371 --> 49:34.005
You mean?

49:34.106 --> 49:35.373
I mean...

49:36.942 --> 49:40.912
I am now in the
eternal debt of Rome.

49:40.979 --> 49:44.915
And I pledge all booty
from this field of battle

49:45.017 --> 49:47.652
to our Holy Mother Church.

49:49.021 --> 49:53.926
<i>[distant shouting]</i>

49:55.095 --> 49:58.832
<i>[horse hooves]</i>

49:58.900 --> 50:01.301
Your salts of mercury,
Highness?

50:02.704 --> 50:04.839
And the rain?

50:04.907 --> 50:07.675
It has finally stopped,
Highness.

50:07.742 --> 50:09.410
Try to rest.

50:09.511 --> 50:11.479
Have you a potion there

50:11.547 --> 50:15.183
that would give me
eternal rest?

50:16.818 --> 50:19.587
Half of my army is dead

50:19.654 --> 50:22.824
and cries out for
me to join them.

50:31.667 --> 50:33.234
[loud scream]

50:41.744 --> 50:44.279
So Your Holiness,

50:44.346 --> 50:46.247
as you wished it
so did it come to pass.

50:46.315 --> 50:48.048
Indeed.
The question is...

50:48.149 --> 50:51.452
how exactly did
it come to pass?

50:51.519 --> 50:54.921
Your meaning,
Holy Father?

50:54.989 --> 50:57.057
Do you have anything to
confess to me Cesare

50:57.158 --> 50:59.392
about this past night?

50:59.460 --> 51:02.062
No, Holy Father.

51:02.163 --> 51:04.698
My night was as satisfactory

51:04.799 --> 51:07.967
as I'm sure was yours.

51:08.035 --> 51:12.238
I slept the sleep of
the good and the just...

51:13.540 --> 51:16.108
...as I hope you did,
Holy Father.
