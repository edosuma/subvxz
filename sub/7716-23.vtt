WEBVTT

00:03.420 --> 00:07.089
Oh, man, my delts
are blasted.

00:08.925 --> 00:11.927
A chart for how much
protein powder to scoop

00:12.012 --> 00:14.388
for a 180-pound
man with no fat

00:14.472 --> 00:17.391
Protein powder, huh?
You cut it with water?

00:17.600 --> 00:19.393
Why don't you
just take estrogen?

00:19.477 --> 00:20.477
Here

00:27.694 --> 00:30.529
There you go, boys See how
Papa takes care of you

00:32.490 --> 00:35.075
people thought biceps
were all that.

00:35.618 --> 00:37.369
They'd flex them all
night at the discotheque

00:37.454 --> 00:39.538
all about core, huh?

00:39.622 --> 00:40.622
Yeah

00:41.124 --> 00:42.207
Core's critical

00:42.292 --> 00:45.085
There are four tenets of Pilates
that I live my life by.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.670
One, lengthen

00:47.005 --> 00:48.547
Two, elongate

00:48.715 --> 00:50.883
Listen, guys. I think we all want
to know the same thing, right?

00:50.967 --> 00:51.967
Who's the strongest?

00:52.302 --> 00:54.470
There's only one
way to solve that

00:55.346 --> 00:57.097
Thigh curl contest

00:57.932 --> 00:59.308
All right,
here we go, everybody

00:59.392 --> 01:01.268
May the manliest man win

01:01.352 --> 01:02.352
Go

01:05.482 --> 01:06.648
Feast on this, Lewis

01:08.234 --> 01:11.070
I love the burn
The burn is where I live

01:11.404 --> 01:13.238
Come on, Gabe. You can't
handle his hamstrings.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.990
You're getting hypno-thized

01:15.075 --> 01:16.492
Speed set. One

01:16.993 --> 01:18.869
One, two

01:19.204 --> 01:20.746
Here, this is for your elbows
For your elbows

01:20.830 --> 01:21.830
Thank you
You're welcome.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.499
Five, six...
- Seven

01:24.751 --> 01:27.086
Quick phone call for you guys
Keep going. Eight.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.253
Nine

01:28.463 --> 01:29.838
Hello?
- Ten.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.340
We got it?

01:34.260 --> 01:35.302
Very funny, Jim

01:35.386 --> 01:36.428
Yeah, Jim

01:36.513 --> 01:38.555
Way to mock us for
perfecting our bodies

01:38.681 --> 01:40.974
Everyone, conference room
Now.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.565
All right
Easy there, Grandpa

01:50.151 --> 01:51.652
Okay, you don't
need my help?

01:51.778 --> 01:53.320
Here, here, just

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.167 --> 02:07.876
Morning
Hey

02:08.169 --> 02:12.631
Somebody left in such a hurry
this morning that she forgot

02:13.633 --> 02:15.092
these
Oh

02:15.176 --> 02:16.927
You know, the only thing more
delicious than your feet

02:17.011 --> 02:20.347
is the feast that I am going
to prepare for everyone.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.017
Andy if you're going to
hang out for a while

02:24.102 --> 02:25.102
Uh.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.271
What's this?

02:27.647 --> 02:29.565
This dumb
new rule Robert made

02:29.732 --> 02:31.692
He just wants
visitors to sign in

02:31.901 --> 02:33.694
Is this Robert's
attempt to embarrass me?

02:33.820 --> 02:35.529
No, of course not

02:36.447 --> 02:39.741
It's just... I think it's like
if we make an exception for you

02:39.868 --> 02:42.494
then we have to make an
exception for the water guy

02:42.579 --> 02:44.997
and then it's like, "Where
does it end?' So, just...

02:45.290 --> 02:47.499
Why is it when other people spend
all their time at tee office,

02:47.584 --> 02:50.335
they're rewarded for it
and when I do it,

02:50.420 --> 02:52.754
"It's a little much"?

02:55.258 --> 02:57.050
Is it because I'm not
an employee anymore?

02:57.177 --> 02:58.927
Because that's
what it feels like

02:59.095 --> 03:00.095
All right
enjoy the Illinois game

03:00.180 --> 03:01.138
Good, we have a deal?

03:01.264 --> 03:03.390
Thanks, Janet
Thanks so much, Earl.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.058
Wow. A simultaneous sale

03:05.185 --> 03:06.894
And they said it couldn't be done.
Boom. Screw them

03:07.103 --> 03:09.438
A lot going on, guys
What's happening?

03:09.606 --> 03:10.939
The Binghamton
branch closed last night

03:11.107 --> 03:12.441
and all their
clients are up for grabs

03:12.525 --> 03:14.443
That was a fine branch

03:15.236 --> 03:18.697
Things are really bad under
Robert California I guess

03:18.781 --> 03:20.032
It's like a festival of poo

03:20.158 --> 03:21.450
Hey, come on, language

03:21.534 --> 03:23.827
Yeah, and we're not interested
in your sour grapes, okay?

03:23.912 --> 03:25.787
Jim, tell him where he
can stick his grapes.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.414
In the fridge

03:27.540 --> 03:29.124
No, Jim.
The butt, in his butt

03:29.459 --> 03:30.834
Sorry, man,
I can't focus on zingers

03:30.960 --> 03:32.336
There's too many
potential clients.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.004
You two better
watch yourselves

03:34.088 --> 03:35.505
Yeah, the Syracuse
branch can't be happy

03:35.632 --> 03:37.090
you're taking
New York clients

03:53.107 --> 03:56.318
Robert, why did
Binghamton close?

03:56.402 --> 03:58.862
Can everyone just
Please

04:01.616 --> 04:06.370
saturnalia last night

04:06.454 --> 04:09.456
in celebration of the
finalization of my divorce

04:10.208 --> 04:13.627
of Australian reds

04:14.212 --> 04:16.672
and, how should I say this
Colombian whites.

04:18.132 --> 04:21.260
Wait, what is this
about Binghamton?

04:21.469 --> 04:23.637
The branch closed, forever

04:26.891 --> 04:30.227
Closing the Binghamton branch never
occurred to me before today.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.188
Or, I guess, last night

04:33.856 --> 04:36.358
But, in vino veritas,
as they say

04:36.609 --> 04:39.945
I'm not going to start
doubting my drunken self now

04:42.365 --> 04:46.493
I got your voice
mail from last night

04:49.289 --> 04:50.330
Wonderful

04:50.415 --> 04:56.920
And the answer is yes
yes, yes, yes,

04:57.005 --> 04:58.880
and never

05:06.848 --> 05:11.601
Pam, when's the last time
you lived so intensely

05:11.686 --> 05:14.855
that your brain, literally,
couldn't hold the memories in?

05:15.940 --> 05:17.065
It was the summer

05:17.191 --> 05:18.275
Apparently,
I left a phone message

05:18.359 --> 05:21.903
for Nellie last night, and I
need you to find out what I said

05:22.071 --> 05:24.281
Um, I am a little busy

05:24.490 --> 05:25.574
Yes

05:26.117 --> 05:27.284
Of course

05:28.411 --> 05:32.497
Why don't you list the things that
would keep you from helping me?

05:34.709 --> 05:36.084
Yeah. I can make you a list

05:36.252 --> 05:37.669
Let's do it now

05:38.087 --> 05:40.505
What's number one?

05:42.383 --> 05:45.093
Why don't I help you now?
Okay There we go

05:50.099 --> 05:52.225
Who the hell are Jim Halpert
and Dwight Schrute?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.852
Jim, Dwight,
what are your last names?

05:53.936 --> 05:55.562
And you are?

05:55.855 --> 05:58.357
Harry Jannerone,
Dunder Mifflin Syracuse

06:02.445 --> 06:04.446
What the hell's all this?

06:04.530 --> 06:07.240
Cherries jubilee
over home-made gelato

06:07.950 --> 06:11.787
You live well down here in PA I
want to talk to you guys right now

06:12.288 --> 06:13.330
And Lloyd Gross, too

06:13.456 --> 06:15.207
Which one's that guy?

06:15.833 --> 06:17.334
The salesmen have
a commission cap,

06:17.460 --> 06:19.002
but we figured
out a way around it

06:19.087 --> 06:21.922
Lloyd Gross is a fictional
salesman we invented to

06:22.090 --> 06:26.134
How do I put this? Steal from the
company, embezzle, to commit fraud

06:26.219 --> 06:28.595
Okay, it sounds sketchy but
it helps us get more money.

06:28.679 --> 06:29.721
Yes

06:29.806 --> 06:30.931
Pam made a drawing
of Lloyd.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.433
He is a blend of
all the salesmen

06:35.645 --> 06:37.062
There he is

06:37.563 --> 06:39.231
That's Lloyd.
Me?

06:39.690 --> 06:41.024
Yeah, you

06:41.901 --> 06:43.610
Where do you get off
crossing state lines?

06:44.028 --> 06:47.239
Now, we're actually closer to
Binghamton than you are

06:47.323 --> 06:48.657
kemo sabe

06:48.825 --> 06:51.076
I like to think Lloyd Gross
is a no-nonsense guy

06:51.160 --> 06:53.537
who doesn't back
down from anybody

06:53.621 --> 06:55.831
and he calls
people "kemo sabe.'

06:56.249 --> 06:57.958
They're New York
we're New York.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.751
State line is
the dividing line

06:59.836 --> 07:01.545
That's the way
it's always been

07:01.671 --> 07:03.839
There's actually not a rule
that says that. It's true

07:04.048 --> 07:07.134
It's true. There's no rule. You
can check the employee handbook

07:07.343 --> 07:09.177
Can I check
the employee handbook, Lloyd?

07:09.262 --> 07:11.805
Does it say anything about me
choking a man with my bare hands?

07:12.932 --> 07:13.974
No

07:14.142 --> 07:17.394
Wait, no? Are you kidding me?
You told me there was a rule.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.563
So many people by now

07:19.814 --> 07:23.191
Stay out of my state It's in your
best interest to stay out of my state

07:23.985 --> 07:25.694
I've seen guys
like you, big guys

07:25.820 --> 07:27.529
who like to push
the little guys around

07:27.697 --> 07:30.574
Lloyd Gross eats bullies
like you for breakfast

07:31.534 --> 07:32.993
Stay out of New York, Lloyd

07:33.453 --> 07:36.872
Text from the old wife
I'm going to take that.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.129
How about this, why don't
we just ask Robert?

07:44.213 --> 07:46.548
Can we all agree that maybe
the CEO should decide this?

07:46.716 --> 07:48.049
Robert's here?

07:48.509 --> 07:51.303
Look at us,
bickering like school girls

07:51.387 --> 07:54.055
looking around the room for
things to hit each other with

07:54.140 --> 07:55.682
were doing that

07:55.766 --> 07:58.560
Chair, lamp, plant,
table leg Jim's leg

08:01.105 --> 08:05.025
Where's the Advil, Jim? I think
I've hit my limit on the Tylenol...

08:05.109 --> 08:06.109
Sorry, not Jim

08:06.235 --> 08:08.069
Andrew, what do we have
to do to get rid of you?

08:08.404 --> 08:11.281
Hire you back and send
Erin back to Florida?

08:11.407 --> 08:13.992
Message received
loud and clear

08:14.076 --> 08:15.577
Just have to get
the caramelized sugar

08:15.661 --> 08:16.912
off the pan
before it dries

08:16.996 --> 08:17.996
Oh, for God's sake

08:18.915 --> 08:22.459
Robert California what a
surprise you're here in Scranton

08:22.585 --> 08:23.543
Harry

08:23.628 --> 08:25.337
So, why would you
close Binghamton down

08:25.463 --> 08:27.214
without a transition plan
in place?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.381
How do you mean?

08:30.593 --> 08:34.011
No, no, no, kid, stay there
Do your dishes. Go ahead

08:34.388 --> 08:36.389
Harry, there is a time
for every decision

08:36.474 --> 08:38.433
predetermined
many years ago

08:38.518 --> 08:40.644
There's no benefit
in questioning why

08:40.727 --> 08:43.480
this particular
decision seems

08:45.107 --> 08:46.316
so poorly timed

08:46.651 --> 08:49.069
Okay, what are you deciding?
We get a say.

08:49.153 --> 08:52.364
Listen Robert, I don't have time.
There's a big client in play

08:52.448 --> 08:53.990
Prestige Direct Mail Solutions

08:54.075 --> 08:55.242
used to be Binghamton's
Don't listen to him.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.451
Nope I want it. It's mine

08:56.536 --> 08:57.536
Prestige is ours

08:57.620 --> 08:58.912
Okay, they're responsible
for half of the junk ma

08:58.996 --> 09:00.580
on the eastern seaboard
We get them.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.082
We already put
a call in to them, Robert

09:02.291 --> 09:03.792
We need you to
make a decision

09:04.293 --> 09:05.794
Make a decision.
I have decided

09:06.837 --> 09:09.256
Neither of you are
to have any contact

09:09.340 --> 09:13.677
with either Prestige
or any other Binghamton client

09:13.761 --> 09:16.805
until I've figured out
how to divide things up

09:18.099 --> 09:19.683
As Solomon once said

09:23.980 --> 09:26.064
There's some bizarre energy
in this place today.

09:26.148 --> 09:29.943
Robert going off the rails,
making some funky decisions

09:30.152 --> 09:32.028
Like why is nobody
going to call on Prestige?

09:32.154 --> 09:33.488
That is a huge client

09:33.573 --> 09:35.031
They could give
their business to

09:35.157 --> 09:36.658
the first person to
walk in the door.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.410
Could be any idiot.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.786
Any idiot at all.

09:43.082 --> 09:47.377
Shaping a company is in a sense,
similar to training a geisha.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.089
You have to mold
not merely the physical form

09:51.173 --> 09:55.427
but also the character
The two must harmonize

09:56.846 --> 09:58.638
Are they still there?

09:59.348 --> 10:03.435
They want a decision
who gets the big client

10:04.520 --> 10:06.271
They can wait

10:06.397 --> 10:10.317
I'll still be talking about
geishas long past their bedtime

10:11.485 --> 10:13.528
You know, I trained as one

10:13.696 --> 10:16.823
Is it just me or is our
boss a freaking weirdo?

10:19.327 --> 10:21.369
I'm going to get some air

10:28.044 --> 10:30.962
Jim, you know what would
be really dastardly?

10:31.047 --> 10:34.341
If we snuck out of here
and got to the client first

10:44.894 --> 10:45.935
He's running

10:47.897 --> 10:51.107
Damn it

10:52.026 --> 10:54.152
What... What is this
supposed to be?

10:54.236 --> 10:55.236
It's a monkey

10:55.696 --> 10:58.198
Jim, get real.
This is not a monkey

10:58.282 --> 10:59.699
It's got a hula skirt
and a blue nose.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.201
Hold on. Hold on
Is this him?

11:01.285 --> 11:02.994
What?
Is that him?

11:03.954 --> 11:05.246
It's him! Do something Get out!
Go!

11:05.414 --> 11:06.706
What? What am I
going to do? I don't

11:06.791 --> 11:08.917
Go slash his tires
Go dent his hood!

11:11.671 --> 11:12.837
That's it?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.547
That's great.
That's like a 5-second delay

11:14.632 --> 11:15.799
Dwight

11:15.883 --> 11:16.925
Go

11:17.301 --> 11:20.178
Does this thing have turbo?
Nitrous? Hit the NOS

11:20.262 --> 11:22.597
NOS? You mean like
in Fast & Furious?

11:22.723 --> 11:23.890
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I
definitely have NOS

11:24.016 --> 11:25.558
Hit the NOS.
Are you sure?

11:25.685 --> 11:28.603
Yes. We got it! Go! Brace yourself.
Three, two, one

11:28.688 --> 11:30.063
Here we go

11:35.695 --> 11:38.071
Hello Andy Bernard
to see the CEO

11:38.280 --> 11:39.364
Oh. Do you have
an appointment?

11:39.448 --> 11:40.448
No, I do not

11:40.533 --> 11:42.450
Okay. I think I can
squeeze you in

11:43.828 --> 11:44.953
Seriously?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.331
Because I could just
be anyone. I thought

11:48.457 --> 11:50.125
I was going to
have to convince you

11:50.710 --> 11:51.960
He's really not that busy

11:52.044 --> 11:53.253
Is there someone
here to see me?

11:53.379 --> 11:54.587
Yes. This man

11:54.797 --> 11:56.172
Come on in

12:00.803 --> 12:04.097
So, what do you make of
this Robert California guy?

12:04.640 --> 12:07.809
What does a guy like that
do on an average weeknight

12:07.977 --> 12:10.019
I'll tell you what he does

12:10.146 --> 12:12.605
Hello.
Hello, my clucking hens

12:12.690 --> 12:14.941
Got room for
another in the roost?

12:15.025 --> 12:17.152
Huh? Don't worry I won't lay an egg

12:18.487 --> 12:21.281
Robert sent me to
take over if Pam fails

12:21.615 --> 12:23.658
If?

12:25.161 --> 12:27.787
Crunching numbers all day

12:27.955 --> 12:29.581
Math is for boys

12:33.836 --> 12:35.295
Did someone say "girl talk?'

12:36.839 --> 12:40.133
Sometimes I wonder if I
have ovaries in my scrotum

12:40.217 --> 12:42.552
because I am
great at girl talk

12:42.845 --> 12:45.597
Have you guys been watching
any good Korean soap operas?

12:45.681 --> 12:47.807
I'm pretty deep into
Hee-Jung Cinderella Girl.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.311
Although, I definitely fast-forward
through the Yung Tae storylines

12:51.520 --> 12:54.314
Do you think I'd like that? Or is it
important to have an Asian fetish?

12:54.607 --> 12:58.026
I think you're going to need
to have an Asian fetish. Yeah

12:58.861 --> 13:00.779
It'll be
upsetting if you don't

13:00.863 --> 13:03.907
I'm a former paper executive I know
the product. I know the margins

13:03.991 --> 13:06.701
25% on your costs

13:07.203 --> 13:09.621
Why haven't I heard of you?
You got any references?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.623
No. I'm a rogue

13:12.208 --> 13:13.541
Uh-huh.
Which is the best part

13:13.751 --> 13:15.835
That means you will
be my first customer

13:15.920 --> 13:19.214
and your business will get
100% of my attention.

13:19.381 --> 13:23.718
Now, I have written down
my personal phone number

13:25.304 --> 13:27.263
You call this any time

13:27.723 --> 13:30.725
Every salesman I've ever met has
given me his personal phone number

13:32.228 --> 13:34.687
Of course they have,
which is why I'm giving you

13:35.564 --> 13:37.524
a key to my house

13:40.194 --> 13:45.323
Whatever you need, any time night
or day, you just stop on by.

13:45.908 --> 13:49.494
You want me to drive to
your house if I need paper?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.204
Maybe you just want
someone to talk to,

13:51.288 --> 13:53.998
maybe you need a place to
crash for a couple of days

13:54.208 --> 13:57.001
My wireless password
is "eat, pray, love.'

13:57.086 --> 13:58.670
Easy to remember

13:59.380 --> 14:03.383
Ready? Go, go, go

14:22.236 --> 14:24.028
You all right?
Yeah.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.586
Dwight, what are you doing?

14:39.670 --> 14:40.670
Shh

14:45.092 --> 14:46.885
Go! Go! Take the stairs, now
What are you talking about?

14:47.011 --> 14:49.053
Just run! Take the stairs! I don't
even know where the stairs are

14:49.138 --> 14:50.763
I'll stall him. Go

14:53.225 --> 14:54.976
What are you doing?

14:55.853 --> 14:58.396
I'm going to activate
the seismic fail-safe

14:58.480 --> 15:01.232
We'll be stuck
between floors for hours

15:04.445 --> 15:05.445
Oh

15:07.823 --> 15:09.574
My pants fell down
What?

15:09.658 --> 15:12.410
My pants fell down
I don't have a belt!

15:14.330 --> 15:16.915
Hello, sir, good day. Dwight K.
Schrute Dunder Mifflin Scranton

15:16.999 --> 15:18.291
Forgive my pants
they fell down.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.752
An appointment with Mr. Ramish,
please Right now is fine.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.254
No, no, no. I was here first Dwight K.
Schrute Dunder Mifflin Scranton.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.505
Hi, guys. What's going on?

15:24.590 --> 15:27.592
Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone
Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.594
I was here first. Sorry
about this mix-up Okay.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.638
I already made an appointment
with your secretary

15:31.722 --> 15:32.931
Let me stop you
all right here

15:33.057 --> 15:34.265
I've already picked
a new paper supplier

15:34.516 --> 15:35.767
Wait, it's not
DM Utica, is it?

15:36.018 --> 15:40.396
No, no, it's not Dunder Mifflin at all,
actually. It's Big Red Paper Company

15:40.648 --> 15:41.940
Big Red Paper Company?

15:42.024 --> 15:43.024
Mmm-hmm

15:44.526 --> 15:46.027
Yes, yes, yes

15:49.239 --> 15:50.239
Get me a cup of coffee

15:50.324 --> 15:51.324
Me too

15:51.408 --> 15:53.201
Or do you also have
a monopoly on thirst?

15:53.285 --> 15:55.203
All right, guys, it didn't
work out for any of us,

15:55.329 --> 15:57.246
so we're still
on the same team

15:57.331 --> 15:59.207
Let me get these
No

16:00.042 --> 16:02.543
Let him get his own
He's got Syracuse money

16:02.878 --> 16:05.838
You know your partner's got a lot
of attitude, but I like that.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.548
How long you guys
been dating?

16:07.716 --> 16:09.509
Jim couldn't land me
in a thousand years.

16:09.593 --> 16:10.718
But you're saying
there's a chance.

16:10.844 --> 16:11.970
Shut up

16:14.723 --> 16:15.807
Hey

16:21.063 --> 16:22.897
Excellent. Excellent

16:24.024 --> 16:27.360
Though troubling that your
first instinct is thievery.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.444
What do you want from me?

16:28.529 --> 16:32.573
Now we get to the bottom of Nellie's,
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, never.'

16:32.866 --> 16:34.283
Hello, Nell, it's Mum.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.495
Do keep your chin up. It can't
possibly be as bad as you describe.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.913
Oh, yes, it can

16:42.042 --> 16:44.168
This is MasterCard.
You are over the limit.

16:44.253 --> 16:47.213
Send the minimum payment
of $448 by Monday,

16:47.297 --> 16:49.507
or we will be forced to
send it to collections.

16:49.591 --> 16:50.717
Shopaholic

16:51.135 --> 16:53.011
Sounds like it.
Yeah

16:53.929 --> 16:56.556
Hi, sis. Is your boss
still hitting on you?

17:00.060 --> 17:01.811
This is Annie
from Second Nests.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.856
I'm sorry, but the Romanian
orphanage felt more comfortable

17:04.940 --> 17:07.733
with a two-person nuclear
family than a single mother,

17:07.818 --> 17:09.777
so we're going to hold out for that.
Okay, that's enough

17:09.944 --> 17:11.529
No, no, no Pam, we need to
get to the bottom of this

17:11.613 --> 17:12.864
No. No.
Come on. Come on

17:12.948 --> 17:16.784
Robert, okay... So, I deleted
them all They're all deleted.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.579
Pam, you've
completely bungled this

17:19.913 --> 17:20.913
Ah

17:26.211 --> 17:27.211
Hey

17:29.298 --> 17:33.384
Can I do it, Pam? Can I pull
off a gold Arabian sandal?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.053
Um

17:35.137 --> 17:38.306
Yes. Definitely.
With your hair, certainly

17:39.683 --> 17:40.725
You dropped
your cell phone

17:40.809 --> 17:42.060
Oh, gosh.
Yep

17:42.144 --> 17:44.604
Thank you. I'm so stupid

17:44.813 --> 17:45.938
No. My goodness
you just

17:46.023 --> 17:48.691
You have a lot going on
with Robert and everything

17:48.942 --> 17:51.444
Oh, God,
Pam, don't get me started

17:51.612 --> 17:52.862
No, I will not

17:52.946 --> 17:54.030
You've just got me started

17:54.198 --> 17:58.117
Robert is a filthy beast

18:00.496 --> 18:03.122
Don't you get the feeling
every time he looks at you,

18:03.207 --> 18:05.666
he's just thinking of 15
different ways to do you?

18:06.001 --> 18:06.959
Well

18:07.044 --> 18:09.837
The man talks of
nothing but sex.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.341
Sometimes he talks about
flesh and bacchanals.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.425
Oh, yeah

18:15.594 --> 18:18.179
what he left on my
phone last night

18:18.680 --> 18:21.432
No. Don't. Just put
it out of your mind

18:25.646 --> 18:27.021
Pam, what is your address?

18:27.106 --> 18:29.941
I'm going to send you a pair
of these gold harem shoes

18:30.025 --> 18:32.527
Oh. No, you don't
Yes

18:33.070 --> 18:35.738
Come on, a little
gold Arabian slipper

18:36.323 --> 18:38.157
Things are looking up

18:41.912 --> 18:45.623
I have MasterCard
right where I want them

18:45.707 --> 18:48.960
and I have a new friend

18:50.879 --> 18:52.130
A friend

18:53.590 --> 18:54.799
At work

18:58.554 --> 18:59.762
Erin

18:59.888 --> 19:01.180
There's a call
for you on line 1

19:02.141 --> 19:03.141
Who is it?

19:03.225 --> 19:05.643
He says, "Salvation.'
No last name.

19:09.815 --> 19:10.815
Yeah, hello

19:10.899 --> 19:13.484
You once put me on a list
of the losers in the office

19:13.569 --> 19:16.070
This loser just got
your biggest client

19:16.405 --> 19:17.905
to give him all
their business

19:18.240 --> 19:20.700
So, hire me back,
that business is yours.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.327
Don't, and I will
find another buyer

19:23.787 --> 19:24.912
You're blackmailing me

19:25.247 --> 19:26.998
It's just business

19:28.792 --> 19:31.794
some ineffectual, privileged

19:31.879 --> 19:34.005
effete, soft-penised debutant

19:34.173 --> 19:36.257
You want to start a street
fight with me, bring it on,

19:36.341 --> 19:38.509
but you're going to be
surprised by how ugly it gets

19:38.594 --> 19:42.263
You don't even know my real
name I'm the * Lizard King

19:46.727 --> 19:47.727
Whoa

19:53.066 --> 19:54.817
Well, I gave him a chance

20:03.911 --> 20:04.952
Andy Bernard?

20:05.078 --> 20:06.120
You got a minute?

20:06.330 --> 20:08.623
I'm in the middle
of a piano lesson

20:08.916 --> 20:12.627
I wanted to see if could
interest you in an investment

20:12.711 --> 20:13.753
Dunder Mifflin

20:14.087 --> 20:17.965
Dunder Mifflin
Now, why would I want that?

20:18.508 --> 20:20.009
It's worth half what
it was three years ago

20:20.135 --> 20:21.302
Exactly

20:21.553 --> 20:23.804
And you know better than anyone
that with the right management

20:23.889 --> 20:27.433
it could be worth twice what
you would pay for it today

20:31.980 --> 20:33.272
Why don't you come in?

20:41.323 --> 20:43.407
So, what would you do if you
weren't selling paper?

20:43.617 --> 20:45.284
Oh, man,
I'd have to sell beets

20:45.535 --> 20:46.702
probably submit
them for competition

20:46.828 --> 20:48.037
What?

20:48.121 --> 20:49.247
Yeah, I know it
sounds stupid,

20:49.331 --> 20:51.415
but nationals has always kind
of been a dream of mine.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.417
How have we never
talked about this before?

20:54.753 --> 20:57.672
Wait, you don't even
care about nationals

20:59.633 --> 21:00.883
Nothing?

21:01.343 --> 21:03.761
I've always wanted to
own a bike shop, but

21:03.845 --> 21:05.388
What about you?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.516
I'd like to sell one
big thing, you know?

21:08.850 --> 21:10.434
Like a plane

21:10.686 --> 21:12.520
One sale. I'm out

21:13.939 --> 21:15.398
That sounds lovely

21:15.482 --> 21:18.150
Anyway, Robert's going to run
this company into the ground

21:20.445 --> 21:22.863
so we won't be doing
this in six months.
