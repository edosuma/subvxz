00:02.942 --> 00:04.985
Previously on "Preacher..."

00:04.986 --> 00:07.365
- Remind me what the hell this is for.
- I made a promise.

00:08.554 --> 00:11.130
It feels like... all of God's creation,

00:11.256 --> 00:12.382
inside to me.

00:12.526 --> 00:14.311
We just want what's inside the preacher.

00:14.321 --> 00:15.769
Who are you guys?

00:15.774 --> 00:17.306
We're from Heaven.

00:18.503 --> 00:21.112
These Green Acres guys
breathing down our backs...

00:21.244 --> 00:22.366
What can I do?

00:22.477 --> 00:23.544
Lacey, let's go.

00:23.607 --> 00:24.674
Let's go!

00:24.675 --> 00:25.701
Oh, Clive.

00:25.702 --> 00:27.933
Go easy tonight.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.108 --> 02:12.375
Get away.

02:12.441 --> 02:13.744
Get out of here.

03:04.928 --> 03:07.331
Well, you got me, Clive.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.936
Always do, Lacey. Always do.

03:16.505 --> 03:17.907
What the hell?

03:17.975 --> 03:19.043
Clive, I said...

03:25.616 --> 03:26.715
Lacey?

03:34.090 --> 03:35.225
Shit.

04:54.071 --> 04:55.372
Thank you.

04:57.273 --> 04:58.408
Thank you.

04:59.242 --> 05:00.376
Thank you.

05:25.735 --> 05:27.302
Peace be with you.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.006
And also with you.

05:29.905 --> 05:31.641
Let us pray.

05:31.708 --> 05:34.910
"Guide us, O God, by your
Word, and Holy Spirit,

05:34.977 --> 05:37.480
that in your light we may see light,

05:37.547 --> 05:39.349
in your truth find freedom,

05:39.415 --> 05:41.552
and in your will discover peace."

05:52.396 --> 05:53.530
A word, if I may?

05:54.230 --> 05:56.266
I'm busy, Cass.

05:56.333 --> 05:57.400
You got two minutes.

05:57.466 --> 05:58.844
No, no, no. Two... No.

05:58.845 --> 06:00.604
Two minutes is tough. This
is kind of complicated.

06:00.670 --> 06:02.338
- Well, summarize.
- Done.

06:02.405 --> 06:05.141
It's not really a
strong suit, but all right.

06:05.208 --> 06:08.143
You know, the other
night, we kind of tied one on?

06:08.211 --> 06:09.412
No, not really.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.215
'Course not. You were blizzard.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.648
But I mean after that.

06:12.715 --> 06:14.384
These two fellas come by, right?

06:14.451 --> 06:16.011
Dressed as cowboy-types on the outside,

06:16.018 --> 06:17.786
but sounded more like two blokes

06:17.853 --> 06:19.488
who just stumbled in out
of the pub in Clerkenwell,

06:19.556 --> 06:20.691
if you know what I'm trying to say.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.992
I have no idea.

06:23.059 --> 06:24.795
All right, that bit, that's confusing.

06:24.862 --> 06:27.831
But the point is, things
got testy, right?

06:27.896 --> 06:29.031
Then things got rough.

06:29.098 --> 06:31.000
Now I'm a big
believer in live and let live,

06:31.068 --> 06:32.803
but when someone comes
at one of my friends

06:32.869 --> 06:34.138
brandishing a bloody chainsaw,

06:34.203 --> 06:36.340
we're gonna have issues.

06:36.405 --> 06:38.408
Right. Where are my keys?

06:38.475 --> 06:41.645
I thought they were here for me. Right?

06:41.711 --> 06:42.871
I thought this is my problem,

06:42.912 --> 06:45.013
I'm gonna deal with
it on me own, and I did.

06:45.081 --> 06:48.117
A dozen pieces buried in
a suitcase and that's it.

06:48.184 --> 06:50.119
- Problem solved, right?
- Good.

06:50.186 --> 06:52.489
Good, except they come back.

06:54.290 --> 06:55.424
- Who?
- What do you mean "who?"

06:55.492 --> 06:56.927
Honestly, will you pay attention?

06:56.994 --> 06:58.395
The guys! The ones I was telling you.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.430
They're following me halfway
across the country!

07:01.030 --> 07:02.533
Oh.

07:02.598 --> 07:04.267
- The vampire hunters?
- Yes!

07:04.335 --> 07:06.503
Except they weren't vampire hunters.

07:06.569 --> 07:10.373
They were like
government agency clones, I think.

07:10.439 --> 07:13.677
Or like androids with
human innards or...

07:13.744 --> 07:15.412
Honestly, I don't know how they do it.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.746
The technology's incredible.

07:17.814 --> 07:19.783
Is that an apple pipe?

07:19.848 --> 07:21.751
Yeah, but that's not what this is about.

07:21.818 --> 07:23.453
You know, I've got...

07:23.518 --> 07:25.622
Ooh!

07:25.689 --> 07:26.890
Jesus.

07:28.458 --> 07:30.093
You ever been to New York?

07:30.160 --> 07:32.996
Or San Francisco? Tijuana?

07:33.062 --> 07:35.631
Honestly, the stories I
could tell you about TJ, man.

07:35.699 --> 07:37.165
What are you talking about now?

07:37.232 --> 07:39.168
I'm talking about we
have to get you out of here!

07:39.235 --> 07:41.404
Road trip. You've got to
know that's where this is headed.

07:41.470 --> 07:43.273
I'm not going anywhere. Did
something happen to the van?

07:43.340 --> 07:44.620
Yeah, that was the clone people.

07:44.674 --> 07:46.343
That was the second
time I killed them there.

07:46.410 --> 07:47.443
All right, what were you smoking?

07:47.509 --> 07:49.812
Attic insulation, mostly.

07:49.879 --> 07:52.615
But look, that's not what
this is about, you know?

07:52.682 --> 07:56.018
Cassidy, what is wrong with you?

07:56.086 --> 07:58.355
What's wrong with you, huh?

07:58.420 --> 08:00.790
I've got no air-conditioning.

08:00.857 --> 08:02.693
Fix the damn thing already, would you?

08:08.665 --> 08:10.833
Padre, I'm trying to tell you...

08:10.900 --> 08:13.970
That thing you've got inside
your pupil, they're gonna want that.

08:17.441 --> 08:18.761
And I'm going to give it to them.

08:21.711 --> 08:23.247
Nice outfit, by the way.

08:36.525 --> 08:38.162
This world...

08:56.412 --> 08:57.413
Where's Donnie?

08:58.213 --> 08:59.382
Called in sick.

09:08.357 --> 09:09.726
Hello.

09:09.791 --> 09:10.927
Uh...

09:12.728 --> 09:14.698
Thank you all for coming out today.

09:14.764 --> 09:16.500
There are some lessons to be learnt.

09:18.569 --> 09:22.104
First, you boys need to
watch the roughhousing.

09:22.171 --> 09:23.639
'Cause this is what can happen.

09:25.174 --> 09:26.343
And, uh, you ladies,

09:28.144 --> 09:30.304
if you're gonna be out
here in the middle of the night,

09:30.313 --> 09:31.873
you need to watch where you're walking.

09:48.397 --> 09:50.133
All right, you heard him. Show's over.

09:51.468 --> 09:53.002
Come on, let's go.

09:58.940 --> 10:00.375
Come on.

10:00.443 --> 10:01.678
What the hell was that?

10:02.612 --> 10:04.747
What?

10:04.814 --> 10:07.550
Am I the only one who sees a
dead girl hanging there by her ankles?

10:07.617 --> 10:10.087
Well, what do you
expect? It's Chinatown.

10:40.317 --> 10:41.951
Hey.

10:42.017 --> 10:44.220
- Mom home?
- She's pooping.

10:50.026 --> 10:51.626
Oh, I'm sorry to barge in.

10:51.694 --> 10:52.795
Timmy let me in.

10:52.862 --> 10:55.263
Tommy. It's Tommy. Barge in away.

10:55.330 --> 10:56.766
Uh, what's up?

10:56.833 --> 10:58.968
How many people did we
have in the church last Sunday?

10:59.035 --> 11:00.203
Twenty-five? Thirty?

11:00.270 --> 11:01.337
I have to check my notes,

11:01.404 --> 11:03.973
but I think 22, including infants.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.509
- Why?
- Twenty-two.

11:08.611 --> 11:11.247
But after the baptism and the outreach
we did, I bet it's more.

11:11.314 --> 11:12.549
Well, I want it full.

11:13.549 --> 11:14.784
How do we make that happen?

11:14.851 --> 11:16.619
- Mommy!
- Mom!

11:16.685 --> 11:19.955
You guys are supposed to be getting
ready for soccer practice!

11:20.022 --> 11:22.391
Patience and hard work.

11:22.458 --> 11:24.260
We're just getting started, Jesse.

11:24.327 --> 11:25.462
What about a raffle?

11:25.529 --> 11:26.597
Raffle?

11:28.298 --> 11:31.468
I mean, I could ask
Gary if he could donate

11:31.535 --> 11:32.968
a Flavor Station gift certificate.

11:33.035 --> 11:36.372
No, no. Something people
want, like a TV.

11:36.439 --> 11:37.741
You know, people come crawling
out of the woodwork

11:37.806 --> 11:39.208
for one of them big flat-screens, right?

11:39.275 --> 11:41.843
For a $1,000 model we
can in no way afford?

11:41.910 --> 11:43.446
Yeah, they'll come running, Jesse.

11:43.512 --> 11:45.447
You don't need to worry about
the money. That's not an issue.

11:45.515 --> 11:46.750
Jesse, what is this?

11:47.549 --> 11:48.919
What happened?

11:49.718 --> 11:51.219
Did you do something?

11:51.286 --> 11:52.723
Did I do something?

11:54.589 --> 11:55.658
What do you mean?

11:57.059 --> 11:58.060
Nothing.

11:58.895 --> 11:59.896
Mom!

11:59.962 --> 12:01.030
You guys...

12:01.097 --> 12:03.566
I'll be there in a minute, Alice.

12:03.632 --> 12:05.234
What do you mean, "Did I do something?"

12:05.301 --> 12:07.670
- Give me a for-instance.
- A for-instance...

12:07.737 --> 12:09.505
Someone said they saw you

12:09.572 --> 12:11.207
breaking into Linus
Dilmoe's place the other night,

12:11.274 --> 12:14.910
and the next day, saw him driving
his bus with his face all bandaged.

12:14.977 --> 12:16.100
Yeah, that was...

12:16.101 --> 12:18.081
Never mind. I know your business
is your business.

12:18.146 --> 12:19.516
I've learnt that much.

12:19.583 --> 12:21.718
It's just, for me, I've
been feeling things

12:21.785 --> 12:23.319
were getting on an overall, you know,

12:23.386 --> 12:25.856
nice track at the
church with us, and I just...

12:28.391 --> 12:30.459
I worry about you sometimes.

12:32.295 --> 12:34.164
You don't need to worry about me, Em.

12:36.332 --> 12:37.400
Not now.

12:39.501 --> 12:40.636
Not anymore.

12:42.338 --> 12:43.473
Okay?

12:44.607 --> 12:45.775
Okay.

12:48.779 --> 12:50.280
Think you got...

12:52.214 --> 12:53.617
- ...a Band-Aid.
- Band-Aid.

12:55.318 --> 12:57.220
So, you think you'll
be able to pick up the TV?

12:57.286 --> 12:59.555
I'm working a double.
Maybe you could do it?

12:59.622 --> 13:01.924
Well, I gotta prepare.

13:01.991 --> 13:04.260
Best Buy on I-10's open until 11:00.

13:04.327 --> 13:06.096
No, I know. It's just I have the kids.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.530
All right. I'll ask
Cassidy.

13:08.598 --> 13:11.668
Oh, no. It's okay. I'll
just get a sitter.

13:11.734 --> 13:13.369
- You sure? That's great.
- Mmm.

13:13.435 --> 13:16.839
After what I'm gonna do, that
church is gonna be full every Sunday.

13:16.905 --> 13:18.141
It'll be worth it.

13:18.207 --> 13:19.543
What are you gonna do?

13:20.510 --> 13:21.812
Something wonderful.

13:37.244 --> 13:39.147
- Like that.
- Easy.

13:41.248 --> 13:42.283
Come on.

13:43.884 --> 13:45.751
People look to you.

13:45.818 --> 13:48.387
It's important to make an
example for others to learn from.

13:48.455 --> 13:50.124
Understand?

13:50.190 --> 13:52.059
Jesse, do you understand?

14:32.331 --> 14:34.000
You said you'd bring him to us.

14:34.802 --> 14:36.970
No, I said I'd talk to him.

14:37.037 --> 14:38.739
Act as the middleman. And I have.

14:38.805 --> 14:40.274
And, do you know, honestly,
he's intrigued.

14:40.340 --> 14:42.174
He just wants to know a little
bit more about your plan, that's all.

14:42.241 --> 14:43.443
The plan is simple.

14:43.509 --> 14:44.979
The Preacher comes to us,

14:45.046 --> 14:47.248
we remove what's inside of
him and take it back with us.

14:47.313 --> 14:49.082
Right. Do you know what, I'm gonna...

14:50.084 --> 14:51.953
Write this down.

14:52.952 --> 14:54.321
Get on the same page here.

14:54.387 --> 14:56.023
So...

14:56.090 --> 14:58.259
What's inside him, exactly?

14:58.325 --> 15:00.027
- We can't say.
- I see.

15:01.327 --> 15:02.495
But you'll remove it how?

15:03.730 --> 15:04.831
Cut him open.

15:06.733 --> 15:08.602
- With a chainsaw?
- Right.

15:08.667 --> 15:12.339
Although, we could try to
draw it out with a song again.

15:12.406 --> 15:14.875
- Song?
- Wynken, Blynken and Nod.

15:14.941 --> 15:16.275
His favorite.

15:16.342 --> 15:18.778
Mmm. Wynken, Blynken and
Nod. Yeah, that sounds great.

15:18.845 --> 15:21.849
I just... I think he'll prefer
that to the saw, I'll be honest.

15:21.916 --> 15:25.186
We scoop it out and get
it back into its domicile.

15:25.251 --> 15:26.731
Because it lives inside a coffee can.

15:26.754 --> 15:28.254
Put it back into its domicile,

15:28.321 --> 15:30.157
take it home where it belongs,

15:30.222 --> 15:31.991
and that is the plan.

15:32.058 --> 15:34.193
This guy... That is
just... That's brilliant.

15:34.260 --> 15:35.995
That's a really interesting plan.

15:36.062 --> 15:37.530
So you're from Heaven, right?

15:37.596 --> 15:38.831
That's right.

15:38.898 --> 15:40.768
Which means what? You're
angels or something?

15:42.034 --> 15:43.136
Right, okay.

15:44.104 --> 15:45.524
But you aren't...

15:45.645 --> 15:48.642
Look, no offence, but as far
as angels go, you're not actually...

15:48.709 --> 15:49.910
You two aren't in charge, are you?

15:51.043 --> 15:53.114
No. No, no, no, no. Not at all.

15:53.913 --> 15:55.816
Right.

15:55.882 --> 15:58.052
Yeah, that's been
really helpful. That's great.

15:58.119 --> 15:59.320
So payment.

15:59.986 --> 16:01.588
What's the offer?

16:01.654 --> 16:02.990
"Payment"? As in money?

16:06.793 --> 16:09.864
Jesse has a weakness for
controlled substances, all right?

16:11.965 --> 16:13.499
China white,

16:13.566 --> 16:14.902
black beauties,

16:16.103 --> 16:18.005
reds, blues,

16:18.071 --> 16:20.407
and opiates are a particular weakness.

16:20.474 --> 16:23.244
But a great honking
armful of drugs, it just...

16:23.310 --> 16:25.111
It'd really help close
the deal here, boys.

16:25.177 --> 16:26.346
You know what I mean?

16:29.916 --> 16:31.152
Or money will do.

16:40.827 --> 16:42.429
I'll just take the whole lot.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.634
Well, where are you going?

16:47.701 --> 16:49.201
You need to bring him to us.

16:49.268 --> 16:51.105
Yeah, but I can't bring him
to you without leaving, can I?

16:51.171 --> 16:53.374
When will you be back?

16:54.207 --> 16:55.208
Soon.

16:57.844 --> 17:00.114
- Be specific.
- Very soon.

17:03.984 --> 17:05.051
See you in a bit.

17:07.555 --> 17:08.723
I don't trust him.

17:14.662 --> 17:15.997
Fiore, what are you doing?

17:20.733 --> 17:22.667
It's time to let
them know what's going on.

17:22.734 --> 17:25.905
And if they find out that
we're down here without permission?

17:27.740 --> 17:30.076
Why we're down here without permission?

17:35.481 --> 17:36.850
We can't call them.

17:37.851 --> 17:39.253
We're on our own.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.690
No choice but to trust him.

18:32.638 --> 18:33.940
The Mayor's here.

18:35.942 --> 18:38.077
Your company keeps the lights on.

18:38.144 --> 18:40.113
So the benefits are plain as pie

18:40.180 --> 18:42.516
every time anyone opens
their electric bill.

18:42.582 --> 18:45.285
But this isn't just another dog

18:45.352 --> 18:49.156
or some cow that
wandered into the wrong field.

18:49.955 --> 18:51.190
Hmm.

18:51.258 --> 18:53.961
This is a human
being we're talking about.

18:54.028 --> 18:56.764
You know, this young woman who fell.

18:56.829 --> 18:57.831
All right.

18:59.365 --> 19:02.302
The issue for me is safety.

19:02.368 --> 19:04.771
What's causing these sinkholes
in the first place?

19:05.971 --> 19:07.641
"Plain as pie."

19:07.707 --> 19:08.976
Right.

19:09.041 --> 19:11.044
Well, anyway, I wouldn't be doing my job

19:11.112 --> 19:13.779
as Annville's elected representative

19:13.846 --> 19:15.482
if I didn't come over and check in,

19:15.548 --> 19:18.585
and, you know, talk your ears
off a little bit about it.

19:18.652 --> 19:21.489
- Which you have.
- Which I have.

19:22.955 --> 19:24.041
Thanks for your time.

19:24.166 --> 19:27.261
You know, so back to the
salt mines of government.

19:28.495 --> 19:30.264
How was Austin, Mr. Mayor?

19:31.364 --> 19:32.466
Oh, Austin?

19:33.666 --> 19:35.468
Threadgill's Restaurant, Austin, Texas.

19:37.136 --> 19:39.005
Right, I just...

19:39.073 --> 19:41.742
I stopped in for a bite just last week.

19:41.807 --> 19:44.510
You stopped in for a bite just last week

19:44.577 --> 19:47.681
with Jerry Cutler and
others from Green Acre Group.

19:50.383 --> 19:51.785
That's right.

19:51.852 --> 19:54.321
Well, I know they've
been reaching out to you, too.

19:54.386 --> 19:56.490
I mean, it's kind of an amazing company.

19:56.557 --> 20:01.027
You know, I don't know if you've
seen any of their informationals,

20:01.094 --> 20:04.931
but, I mean, they
have a ton of cool stuff on

20:04.998 --> 20:07.902
soil sustainability and aeroponics.

20:15.108 --> 20:19.112
"Profitability problems with
water, earth and sun solutions...

20:20.213 --> 20:22.182
Sustainability silos...

20:23.549 --> 20:25.719
Business brawn of the bean curd."

20:25.786 --> 20:27.387
You see, you should meet them,

20:27.453 --> 20:28.721
hear them out.

20:28.788 --> 20:32.159
I'm telling you, they're really nice.

20:32.224 --> 20:34.194
It'd be a hell of a partnership.

20:37.530 --> 20:40.768
My grandfather, Jonas Quincannon.

20:42.234 --> 20:43.502
One time, the Gormann Brothers

20:43.569 --> 20:45.873
had a pork concern out at Las Cruces.

20:45.939 --> 20:47.374
Hoping to move in on his territory,

20:47.440 --> 20:51.143
they were pressuring
wholesalers, something like that.

20:51.211 --> 20:53.881
Uh, anyway, Jonas found out about it.

20:55.449 --> 20:57.084
He took care of it.

20:57.151 --> 20:59.152
Took care of them.

20:59.219 --> 21:01.488
Didn't ask, didn't
warn, didn't get angry.

21:02.989 --> 21:04.792
Just got what needed doing done.

21:07.461 --> 21:08.962
Nobody said a damn word.

21:11.297 --> 21:12.832
Yeah.

21:12.899 --> 21:15.002
His father, same way. My father...

21:16.769 --> 21:18.172
All of them.

21:19.172 --> 21:21.174
No one said boo.

21:24.845 --> 21:25.845
Yeah.

21:28.114 --> 21:30.584
Local tax revenues...

21:30.650 --> 21:33.286
They're down 11% in the last 36 months.

21:33.353 --> 21:36.256
Fifty-eight percent in the last 10 years.

21:36.323 --> 21:40.227
Mr. Quincannon, we're in a malaise here.

21:40.294 --> 21:42.028
This town, I mean...

21:42.828 --> 21:45.432
We grow or we die.

21:45.499 --> 21:47.401
Something needs to change.

21:47.468 --> 21:49.570
And this could be just the thing,

21:49.635 --> 21:51.070
the shot in the arm we all need.

21:51.136 --> 21:52.471
So with your permission,

21:52.538 --> 21:54.141
I would love to arrange a meeting

21:54.208 --> 21:56.210
for you to sit down with them and...

21:56.276 --> 21:57.745
- What are you...
- Don't look at me.

21:58.478 --> 21:59.947
Oh, come on.

22:03.217 --> 22:04.685
Plain as pie.

22:21.401 --> 22:23.369
Two half-pound patties,

22:23.435 --> 22:26.740
covered in cheese, dripping in sauce.

22:26.806 --> 22:29.843
The Big As Texas Burger.

22:29.910 --> 22:32.045
Fit your mouth around this.

22:49.895 --> 22:50.931
Don't.

22:53.566 --> 22:55.001
Do not answer that phone.

23:01.474 --> 23:02.475
Hello.

23:05.545 --> 23:06.547
Checking out?

23:07.881 --> 23:08.882
Very soon.

23:27.134 --> 23:28.235
Where are you going?

23:29.768 --> 23:30.903
I'm hungry.

23:42.716 --> 23:45.752
One Big As Texas Burger, please.

23:45.818 --> 23:47.153
Sorry.

23:47.220 --> 23:49.489
We ain't got a
restaurant or room service here.

23:49.556 --> 23:50.958
We got a vending machine.

24:14.748 --> 24:15.981
Oh, hey, come on.

24:16.048 --> 24:17.450
Let me give you a hand with that.

24:17.517 --> 24:18.619
Wow!

24:18.684 --> 24:20.620
Okay.

24:20.686 --> 24:22.421
Whoa!

24:22.488 --> 24:25.159
- How much did that put you back?
- Too much.

24:25.959 --> 24:27.561
I told you not to clean.

24:27.627 --> 24:29.562
Oh, I just straightened up a little.

24:31.431 --> 24:32.499
Kids go down all right?

24:32.565 --> 24:34.000
Oh, yeah. They went down great.

24:34.066 --> 24:36.635
Cleaned their plates, finished
their homework.

24:36.702 --> 24:40.507
Tommy helped Alice with her
jammies which was very cute.

24:41.173 --> 24:42.175
Good.

24:43.977 --> 24:45.411
You want wine? You look stressed.

24:45.478 --> 24:48.115
No. No, thank you. I
got way too much left to do.

24:48.181 --> 24:50.584
You got here when? 4:30?

24:51.617 --> 24:52.851
All right. We went over this.

24:52.919 --> 24:55.054
Nothing I'd rather
do on my Saturday night

24:55.121 --> 24:57.191
than look after your little scamps.

24:59.459 --> 25:03.129
Well, I appreciate the help.

25:03.195 --> 25:04.230
What... Please.

25:04.297 --> 25:06.432
After everything you
do for everyone else?

25:06.499 --> 25:10.603
I mean, the kids, the
Flavor Station, the church.

25:10.670 --> 25:13.672
You know, running
around for Preacher Custer.

25:13.740 --> 25:16.210
I mean, Lord knows you deserve a break.

25:23.716 --> 25:25.685
So I said,

25:25.751 --> 25:28.488
"I understand you're upset
about the Zoning Bill, Doug.

25:28.555 --> 25:30.856
You can come to my
house and pull your pants down

25:30.923 --> 25:32.759
every day of the week, twice on Sundays,

25:32.826 --> 25:34.660
but it won't change a little something

25:34.727 --> 25:38.198
called the United States Constitution."

25:38.265 --> 25:39.733
I bet that brought him up short.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.467
Well, he still went ahead and
defecated on my driveway.

25:41.534 --> 25:42.768
What?

25:42.835 --> 25:44.970
To be fair, he was conflicted.

25:45.038 --> 25:47.708
He was apologizing the
whole time it was going on.

25:47.774 --> 25:49.843
- No.
- Yeah, yeah. It's true.

25:49.910 --> 25:52.679
I mean, he even helped
me clean it up afterwards.

25:52.746 --> 25:55.682
Which is more than I
could say for Odin Quincannon.

25:55.749 --> 25:59.886
I mean, he has once and for all
and finally slipped his biscuit.

26:10.195 --> 26:11.330
I'm never gonna be with you.

26:11.397 --> 26:13.065
You know that, right, Miles?

26:16.068 --> 26:18.672
Yeah, you've told me enough times, sure.

26:24.410 --> 26:27.247
Out before morning. Kids
almost caught you last time.

26:48.067 --> 26:51.104
"In the mouth of the foolish
is a rod for his back.

26:51.170 --> 26:54.374
But the lips of the
wise will protect them.

26:54.441 --> 26:57.543
Where no oxen are, the manger is clean.

26:57.609 --> 27:00.546
But much revenue comes by
the strength of the ox."

27:05.285 --> 27:08.021
To me, Lacey was just fun.

27:08.087 --> 27:12.491
She liked TV and eating and
trying on different shoes.

27:13.191 --> 27:14.393
When I think of her...

27:14.461 --> 27:16.430
What the hell do oxen
have to do with anything, huh?

27:16.496 --> 27:17.964
Explain that to me.

27:18.030 --> 27:19.365
It's a parable.

27:19.432 --> 27:22.035
It's bullshit, is what it is.

27:22.102 --> 27:25.705
Lacey wasn't called to
Heaven by fairies on a cloud.

27:25.771 --> 27:28.741
She was run down by a
bunch of cavemen with pop guns,

27:28.807 --> 27:30.710
and fell into a bottomless shit pit.

27:30.777 --> 27:32.412
No, that was an accident.

27:32.479 --> 27:33.980
We weren't trying to hurt anyone.

27:34.047 --> 27:36.449
Not talking to you, Vern. Shut up.

27:36.516 --> 27:38.051
Comes to men and their deviancies,

27:38.117 --> 27:40.787
I threw my hands up long ago.

27:40.853 --> 27:43.156
But, you ladies, you should know better.

27:43.222 --> 27:45.258
Running around in your underwear,

27:45.325 --> 27:46.927
getting hunted like animals.

27:46.992 --> 27:48.272
What the hell were you thinking?

27:48.327 --> 27:49.828
You hear that, girls?

27:49.895 --> 27:52.531
Instead of all this, you should be
working for dollar tips at Denny's.

27:52.598 --> 27:55.000
Shut your mouth, Clive.

27:55.067 --> 27:57.069
No, you shut yours, O'Hare.

27:57.136 --> 28:01.140
No one wants to hear
your girlie-go power bullshit.

28:01.208 --> 28:02.608
Too bad about Lacey.

28:02.674 --> 28:05.278
Great piece of ass. Boo hoo.

28:05.345 --> 28:07.346
You work in a
whorehouse long enough, eventually...

28:07.413 --> 28:08.582
That's enough, Clive.

28:08.647 --> 28:10.649
There'll be no
fighting. Not here. Not tonight.

28:10.717 --> 28:11.884
I'll tell you what, boys.

28:11.951 --> 28:14.586
In honor of Lacey and her peaceful ways,

28:14.653 --> 28:16.189
next hour's on the house.

28:21.027 --> 28:22.629
Come on, let's just go upstairs.

28:29.435 --> 28:33.272
You were a damn cute little
girl, Priscilla-Jean.

28:33.339 --> 28:36.308
- I know.
- Fun, funny. Such a great spirit.

28:36.375 --> 28:39.680
But that temper of yours, not
even your mama could handle it.

28:40.712 --> 28:42.915
My mama never tried, Mose.

28:42.981 --> 28:46.052
She was too busy up there,
handling all them boners and balls.

28:47.354 --> 28:49.521
Be a good girl.

28:49.588 --> 28:51.124
I'm gonna go make us some tea.

28:58.530 --> 28:59.932
Ugh.

29:14.881 --> 29:16.450
- Yes. Yes.
- What the hell?

29:18.084 --> 29:19.751
Eat shit, Clive.

29:42.607 --> 29:43.710
Jesus. Oh, God.

29:43.777 --> 29:44.911
I'm so sorry!

29:44.978 --> 29:46.579
Oh, please don't
die, mister! Please don't!

29:46.644 --> 29:48.047
I didn't mean to. I...

29:48.114 --> 29:49.481
It's my stupid fricking temper.

29:49.548 --> 29:51.249
I just... I thought you
were this other guy and...

29:51.316 --> 29:53.051
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

29:53.118 --> 29:55.654
- Can you please go faster?
- I'm trying.

29:55.721 --> 29:58.557
It's okay. It's all right. Just
keep breathing, all right.

29:58.624 --> 30:00.992
I thought you were that dickwich, Clive.

30:01.059 --> 30:03.395
Stupid, stupid, stupid Tulip!

30:03.462 --> 30:05.597
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

30:05.664 --> 30:06.752
Please God... Please God, or

30:06.777 --> 30:08.291
whatever the hell you call yourself,

30:08.334 --> 30:10.268
I know we hate each other,
but please, please, please,

30:10.336 --> 30:12.271
just this once, do the right thing here.

30:12.338 --> 30:13.605
I'll be good, I swear. I'll be good.

30:13.672 --> 30:16.107
I'll be so damn good, you
won't even know it's me.

30:16.174 --> 30:18.677
- Kiss me.
- What?

30:18.745 --> 30:19.980
- Kiss me.
- Okay, okay, okay.

30:20.046 --> 30:21.681
- Kiss me.
- Okay, relax.

30:30.155 --> 30:31.635
It's all right. You're gonna make it.

30:39.765 --> 30:41.768
My friend needs a doctor.

30:43.036 --> 30:45.372
Whoa! No, no. Are you listening?

30:45.438 --> 30:47.774
No forms or take-a-number crap.

30:47.839 --> 30:50.509
He needs a fricking doctor,
grandma, and he needs it fricking now!

30:53.078 --> 30:54.181
Who?

31:18.384 --> 31:19.705
You were right, love.

31:20.772 --> 31:22.374
I think I'm gonna make it.

31:28.949 --> 31:30.679
Wake up.

31:35.622 --> 31:36.725
We gotta go.

31:49.837 --> 31:50.972
Wait here.

32:28.075 --> 32:29.243
But she's my daughter.

32:44.091 --> 32:46.427
Denounce him.

32:46.494 --> 32:47.896
Denounce him!

32:49.196 --> 32:50.197
Come on.

33:03.511 --> 33:05.847
Some people just can't be saved.

33:27.334 --> 33:30.538
Poor bastard. No
idea what's coming for him.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.745
Where shall we put John Baugh?

33:37.812 --> 33:39.147
Here, with Bowie.

33:40.548 --> 33:41.850
Not with Travis?

33:41.916 --> 33:43.850
No. Fell back with Jim Bowie.

33:43.918 --> 33:48.356
Met his end manning that 12-pounder
in the chapel there.

33:48.423 --> 33:51.726
But Bowie died in
the barracks, didn't he?

33:54.862 --> 33:55.930
Yeah, of course.

33:57.864 --> 34:00.600
- I had an idea, Mr. Quincannon.
- Did you?

34:00.668 --> 34:01.703
For the church.

34:04.171 --> 34:05.506
A way to teach a lesson.

34:08.708 --> 34:11.178
I just have to find
someone people look up to,

34:12.513 --> 34:13.915
a leader of the community,

34:14.782 --> 34:16.384
show them as an example.

34:18.253 --> 34:20.589
- Come to church tomorrow.
- No, thank you.

34:22.556 --> 34:25.391
- How long since you've been?
- Church service? Long time.

34:26.695 --> 34:29.397
Time was you were a regular.

34:29.463 --> 34:30.663
Past due now, don't you think?

34:30.665 --> 34:33.199
A man of your years

34:33.266 --> 34:36.603
got to be thinking what happens
next after he dies.

34:36.670 --> 34:38.004
Now, you know the rules.

34:38.072 --> 34:41.208
I don't talk how my meat gets made,

34:41.274 --> 34:43.510
you don't talk about your
magic man in the sky.

34:43.577 --> 34:44.844
No shame in having questions.

34:44.911 --> 34:46.714
I'm not ashamed.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.916
And I know what comes next. Nothing.

34:50.918 --> 34:52.085
Maybe.

34:54.286 --> 34:55.956
But what if you're wrong?

34:57.892 --> 34:59.560
What if there's Judgement?

34:59.626 --> 35:01.829
"Judgement."

35:01.896 --> 35:04.499
What if we're held to
account for our actions?

35:08.102 --> 35:09.504
What if there's punishment?

35:11.738 --> 35:13.340
What if there is fire?

35:14.642 --> 35:17.979
What if there's ice and darkness?

35:19.412 --> 35:22.382
What if there's
beasts with cloven hooves

35:22.450 --> 35:25.553
and tortured children and
screams that curdle your blood?

35:25.619 --> 35:27.587
What if they tear you
apart real slow-like,

35:27.655 --> 35:29.256
with chains and spikes?

35:29.323 --> 35:31.192
What if it's deeper
than that, like some say,

35:31.258 --> 35:33.490
and you spend all eternity living your

35:33.515 --> 35:35.688
worst memory over and over and over?

35:38.032 --> 35:39.365
Or what if you feel nothing?

35:39.432 --> 35:41.602
Except for all the pain you
caused everybody else?

35:44.137 --> 35:45.139
Jeez.

35:47.908 --> 35:49.209
Aren't you afraid?

35:50.378 --> 35:51.613
Nope.

35:53.514 --> 35:54.916
Seems to me you are, Preacher.

36:00.787 --> 36:02.690
I could make you come to church.

36:05.660 --> 36:07.662
That wouldn't be very Christian of you.

36:17.838 --> 36:19.307
My father's land.

36:20.675 --> 36:21.943
You always wanted it.

36:24.845 --> 36:27.148
Biggest plot left you don't already own.

36:30.117 --> 36:31.553
It's more than 20 hectares, yeah.

36:35.021 --> 36:36.090
Come to church tomorrow.

36:37.091 --> 36:38.091
Listen to my sermon.

36:38.158 --> 36:39.727
You don't leave a Christian after that,

36:41.428 --> 36:42.530
it's yours.

37:01.635 --> 37:04.884
_

37:08.289 --> 37:09.624
Peace be with you.

37:09.689 --> 37:11.126
And also with you.

37:13.861 --> 37:16.498
I want to thank you all for
coming out this morning.

37:16.564 --> 37:19.367
I know it's not always
easy to get here on a Sunday.

37:20.535 --> 37:22.469
Kids don't want to get dressed.

37:22.535 --> 37:23.937
Lawn needs mowing.

37:24.004 --> 37:26.941
Doing laundry, paying bills.

37:27.008 --> 37:29.076
Whatever. It's been a long week,

37:29.142 --> 37:32.111
and you got another one
starting up tomorrow, so thank you.

37:32.178 --> 37:34.682
Besides, and here's the real reason

37:34.749 --> 37:36.751
it ain't easy getting here, and that's,

37:37.751 --> 37:39.219
"What good's it gonna do?"

37:39.287 --> 37:40.889
Right?

37:40.954 --> 37:43.157
I mean, look at this world.

37:43.224 --> 37:46.360
You turn on the
radio, surf the Internet.

37:46.427 --> 37:48.162
Heck, look out your dang window.

37:49.796 --> 37:51.865
It's crazy out there.

37:51.932 --> 37:53.566
You've got wars in every direction,

37:53.633 --> 37:57.572
bombs going off in
coffee shops and schools.

37:58.506 --> 38:00.108
Folks scared to hug each other

38:00.173 --> 38:02.543
on account of some new disease.

38:03.177 --> 38:04.879
Yep.

38:04.945 --> 38:07.782
The world is turning to shit.

38:11.619 --> 38:12.620
And you know what?

38:14.622 --> 38:16.057
It's all your fault.

38:19.992 --> 38:23.863
You've turned your back on the Lord.

38:23.930 --> 38:28.168
Your despair has
caused you to lose faith,

38:28.236 --> 38:30.604
embrace false idols.

38:30.671 --> 38:34.642
But these idols, these things...

38:36.043 --> 38:37.479
They won't save you.

38:39.213 --> 38:41.483
Your whisky won't save you.

38:42.381 --> 38:45.284
Your money won't save you.

38:45.352 --> 38:49.057
Sex, love, romance...

38:50.990 --> 38:53.427
They will not save you.

38:53.494 --> 38:56.965
Your parents, your
precious little children,

38:58.633 --> 39:01.503
that 55-inch flat-screen TV out there?

39:02.669 --> 39:03.805
Nothing.

39:04.637 --> 39:06.573
Nothing will save you.

39:07.974 --> 39:09.510
You are sinners.

39:10.477 --> 39:11.745
You have strayed.

39:11.811 --> 39:14.314
You have forgotten the
power of the Lord.

39:18.684 --> 39:19.820
But it's not too late.

39:22.722 --> 39:26.894
I'm here to remind
you that starting today...

39:28.396 --> 39:29.997
No, starting right now,

39:30.064 --> 39:32.901
I'm going to bring you back to God,

39:34.235 --> 39:36.336
one by one.

39:37.738 --> 39:41.242
Beginning with one man amongst us

39:41.309 --> 39:42.877
who has strayed furthest.

39:52.119 --> 39:54.756
God wants you back, Mr. Quincannon.

40:00.227 --> 40:02.697
"Serve him and you will go out in joy,

40:03.564 --> 40:05.700
be led forth in peace."

40:05.767 --> 40:07.634
Right.

40:07.700 --> 40:10.838
"The mountains and hills will
burst into song before you.

40:10.905 --> 40:14.142
And all the trees in the
field will clap their hands."

40:17.378 --> 40:19.080
I ask you now...

40:23.383 --> 40:25.086
Will you serve God?

40:26.320 --> 40:27.322
No.

40:32.892 --> 40:34.327
Will you serve God?

40:34.394 --> 40:36.363
Now, I heard you the first time.

40:36.430 --> 40:37.498
Will you serve Him?

40:37.564 --> 40:38.800
Oh, for Pete's sake.

40:39.399 --> 40:40.867
Odin.

40:40.934 --> 40:43.104
I win, Preacher. It wasn't even close.

40:47.140 --> 40:48.610
Now, I'm telling you...

40:50.209 --> 40:51.979
Serve God.

41:00.655 --> 41:02.256
I ask you again.

41:03.590 --> 41:05.425
Will you serve God?

41:08.628 --> 41:09.831
Of course I will.

41:11.631 --> 41:13.033
Yes, sir.

41:17.271 --> 41:18.339
Yeah.

41:19.073 --> 41:20.208
Of course.

41:21.474 --> 41:22.610
Yeah.

41:23.943 --> 41:25.146
I will.

41:26.646 --> 41:27.648
I will.

41:50.838 --> 41:51.839
Hello.
