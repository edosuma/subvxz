Open Season 3

00:29.447 --> 00:30.485
Woo hoo!

00:30.581 --> 00:32.392
One day to guys trip.

00:43.363 --> 00:44.241
Hey Boog!

00:44.365 --> 00:47.439
When are you gonna bring your fine self
down here to fix up our habitat, huh?

00:48.470 --> 00:51.249
Just as soon as I finish
helping Riley with the dam.

00:57.415 --> 00:58.293
There we go.

00:58.416 --> 01:00.523
You all set for tomorrow?
It's gonna be awesome!

01:00.618 --> 01:01.496
Sorry Boog!

01:01.620 --> 01:03.295
I gotta build this dam.

01:03.421 --> 01:05.301
No guys trip for me.

01:05.424 --> 01:08.302
What? No guys trip?
No guys trip?

01:08.427 --> 01:09.499
Have you lost your mind?

01:09.629 --> 01:12.533
I gotta finish this or
O'Grady will tear my eye.

01:13.433 --> 01:15.370
Yeah. That's okay, it's cool.

01:15.503 --> 01:18.441
We'll think about you while
we're making this and talking trash.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.413
I'm not sure that you can fit in there,
jerky!

01:21.542 --> 01:23.444
Hey, I don't know,
maybe the whole batch?

01:24.513 --> 01:25.483
Alright you troops!

01:25.647 --> 01:27.527
- Let them fly!
- Oi!

01:34.625 --> 01:36.505
Hey, you need anything else,
just let me know.

01:36.628 --> 01:39.372
We gotta get on the road
bright and early tomorrow, baby.

01:39.498 --> 01:41.275
Uh, about that, Boog.

01:41.366 --> 01:42.370
I've got a wee problem.

01:42.501 --> 01:45.280
With all the new kids,
I'm not done collecting my nuts.

01:45.438 --> 01:46.476
Believe me, lad.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.417
I'd rather be skittling with you.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.514
Than getting my minds
with these boffin goons.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.425
Yeah, right.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.329
- Ant! Guys' trip?
- No can't do, bugger!

01:57.585 --> 02:00.261
I got too many. Responsibilities.

02:00.355 --> 02:01.290
No problem.

02:01.524 --> 02:03.301
- Birdie?
- Sorry Boog.

02:03.392 --> 02:04.270
Great.

02:04.527 --> 02:06.464
Surfs, Danny? Let me guess.

02:08.466 --> 02:11.313
Uh. We cannot go suddenly.

02:11.402 --> 02:12.440
That's what I thought.

02:14.540 --> 02:16.442
That's okay.
At least I've got Elliot.

02:16.542 --> 02:17.477
He won't let me down.

02:17.610 --> 02:19.353
It'll be like old times.

02:19.446 --> 02:20.324
Me and he.

02:20.447 --> 02:21.417
The original partners.

02:28.523 --> 02:29.493
Sshh. Quiet.

02:29.624 --> 02:31.401
Koo! Koo-koo!

02:33.528 --> 02:36.409
Giselllal Gesalital I was just
looking for your dad.

02:39.503 --> 02:40.507
Rabbit fight, huh?

02:40.604 --> 02:42.313
Yeah, count me in.

02:42.439 --> 02:43.443
Where's your little bro?

02:45.376 --> 02:47.381
You'll never find me here.

03:07.568 --> 03:09.345
Alright, let's see.

03:09.438 --> 03:10.373
Where to hide?

03:10.572 --> 03:12.509
Ahhh "X" marks the spot!

03:20.552 --> 03:21.487
- Got you!
- Gotcha!

03:21.621 --> 03:22.499
You're out!

03:24.456 --> 03:25.460
You gotta work on the landing.

03:26.526 --> 03:27.530
Great game, dad.

03:27.627 --> 03:29.507
Yeah, great game, you guys.
That was awesome.

03:29.630 --> 03:31.305
Alright, when your mother asks.

03:31.398 --> 03:33.437
You'll say I lost for protecting you
from a wild boar.

03:35.503 --> 03:36.507
And a sidekick ferret.

03:38.474 --> 03:39.512
Mom's gonna kill you.

03:39.608 --> 03:41.545
I was attacked by a ferret.

03:41.677 --> 03:43.386
- No, you weren't.
- Dad.

03:43.479 --> 03:45.325
Stop telling Elvis to lie.

03:45.514 --> 03:47.485
Mom says you're not supposed to do that.

03:47.584 --> 03:49.293
That wasn't a lie?

03:49.386 --> 03:50.321
It was uh.

03:50.454 --> 03:51.424
It was a reverse!

03:51.522 --> 03:55.393
A stretch of a non-actual. Boog.
Buddy, back me up here.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.498
Just tell the truth. It's the only way
to roll.

03:57.629 --> 04:00.271
Exactly what I was saying.

04:00.366 --> 04:01.267
And stay in school.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.301
And don't talk to strangers.

04:02.434 --> 04:03.312
And never run with scissors.

04:03.436 --> 04:05.407
So Boogster, you wanna take
the kids fishing?

04:05.505 --> 04:06.475
Actually, Elliot.

04:06.606 --> 04:09.419
- I'm kinda getting ready for guys'.
- I see where you're going with this.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.447
It's time to teach survival skills.

04:11.545 --> 04:13.391
- I was hoping to.
- Grab a baseball.

04:13.515 --> 04:14.553
- Well I..
- Acupuncture? Origami?

04:14.683 --> 04:16.459
- Elliot. Elliot.
- Yoga? Sumo wrestling?

04:16.586 --> 04:18.488
- Elliot!
- Pods. What happened to pods, right?

04:18.587 --> 04:20.558
I tell you what. Just take them.
Do whatever you want.

04:20.656 --> 04:22.433
I'm trying to get ready for guys' trip!

04:24.460 --> 04:25.395
So are you definitely going?

04:25.496 --> 04:28.343
- How could I miss it?
- Yeah, I knew I could count on you.

04:29.634 --> 04:32.538
Remember to tell Boog
that you can't go on guys' trip.

04:32.638 --> 04:35.382
I meant to say I have to
babysit the kids.

04:35.508 --> 04:38.287
'Cos Giselle's going to see her mother.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.289
That's okay, E.

04:42.417 --> 04:43.318
Don't sweat it.

04:43.418 --> 04:45.298
You've got family obligations.

04:45.420 --> 04:47.300
And sometimes, you've got to cancel.

04:47.423 --> 04:48.301
Sometimes?

04:48.424 --> 04:49.394
Don't you mean always?

04:49.525 --> 04:51.302
How long have you known about this?

04:51.393 --> 04:53.273
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks?

04:53.395 --> 04:54.433
Oh, just forget it.

04:54.564 --> 04:56.535
- I don't know why I even bother.
- Boog!

04:58.435 --> 04:59.439
Oh, he'll get over it.

04:59.537 --> 05:01.417
Just like he did when I
canceled the fishing trip.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.315
I guess rabbit fight's over.

05:04.509 --> 05:05.387
Pretty much.

05:12.652 --> 05:14.532
Mother! I was attacked by a ferret!

05:14.654 --> 05:18.400
I guess me and Elliot. We weren't
as tight as I thought we were.

05:18.659 --> 05:19.537
Oh hey.

05:20.495 --> 05:22.375
You're not gonna cancel
on me too, are you?

05:23.498 --> 05:24.536
'Cos bears gotta stick together.

05:26.401 --> 05:28.281
You know what I like about you,
dinkleman?

05:28.404 --> 05:30.375
You're always there when I need you.

05:30.573 --> 05:31.508
And don't worry.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.520
We're gonna have a blast tomorrow.

05:34.444 --> 05:36.517
This will be the best guys' trip, ever.

05:36.647 --> 05:37.525
You'll see!

05:39.417 --> 05:40.295
Elliot.

05:40.551 --> 05:41.555
Three meals a day.

05:41.653 --> 05:44.432
And everyone in bed by sunset.

05:44.555 --> 05:45.433
I know.

05:45.558 --> 05:47.529
And make sure to apologise to Boog when
he gets back.

05:47.694 --> 05:49.574
- Okay.
- For what?

05:50.631 --> 05:52.568
For some things you said yesterday.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.377
And for some things you forgot to say
two weeks ago?

05:56.571 --> 05:57.549
Kids.

05:58.474 --> 05:59.444
Keep an eye on your dad.

06:00.442 --> 06:02.322
- Bye mom!
- We love you!

06:02.445 --> 06:03.517
- Safe journey!
- Have fun!

06:03.647 --> 06:05.584
Have fun with the old dadillacs.

06:05.681 --> 06:07.561
What was that, Elliot?

06:08.519 --> 06:09.397
I love you.

06:10.421 --> 06:12.426
- Say hi to your mother for me.
- I will.

06:12.524 --> 06:14.529
What are we gonna do first, hm? Father?

06:15.528 --> 06:16.532
Don't worry, kids.

06:16.629 --> 06:19.305
I've got a tons of things planned.

06:19.465 --> 06:20.343
Right.

06:20.466 --> 06:21.538
When does uncle Boog get back, again?

06:31.612 --> 06:32.547
it's gonna be fun!

06:38.621 --> 06:42.526
Then he realised, that his best one horn
friend in the world had abandoned him.

06:42.659 --> 06:44.334
And worse than that?

06:44.562 --> 06:46.499
All that was left on his hand was.

06:47.431 --> 06:48.309
A hook!

06:57.677 --> 06:59.318
This is very fun.

07:00.581 --> 07:02.518
Well, I guess it could be worse.

07:18.569 --> 07:20.278
Who am I kidding?

07:20.405 --> 07:22.285
This whole thing was a bad idea.

07:22.407 --> 07:24.480
It's not a guys' trip with only one guy?

07:26.478 --> 07:28.517
I mean. It's not like I changed?

07:28.615 --> 07:30.426
He's the one who changed.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.432
He's the one who flakes all the time.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.432
But he has a family.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.403
You have to be more understanding.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.470
Yeah.

07:39.661 --> 07:41.336
Understanding my butt!

07:41.463 --> 07:44.469
You're better off without that under
privileged broken horn plank, cancel it.

07:44.567 --> 07:46.538
But you guys are partners.

07:47.436 --> 07:48.314
Partners?

07:50.440 --> 07:51.341
Who cares, baby?

07:51.474 --> 07:53.376
That deer ain't got nothing on us.

07:53.510 --> 07:55.390
Yeah! You know, you're right!

07:58.450 --> 08:01.331
You know, what would be great to eat
just about now?

08:03.689 --> 08:05.330
Another woo-hoo bar.

08:05.458 --> 08:07.360
And I know just the place to get it.

08:11.565 --> 08:12.443
Beautiful.

08:13.502 --> 08:17.316
Now all we need are the balloons and
you'll be ready to go!

08:19.576 --> 08:21.319
Don't worry, baby.

08:21.410 --> 08:25.349
I'll never let anything happen to you,
ever again.

08:35.428 --> 08:36.432
Hello. Ladies!

08:36.562 --> 08:39.375
Don't you all love my finest evening?

08:40.567 --> 08:41.445
Hooty-O's?

08:41.567 --> 08:43.378
Hoo- Hoo.

08:43.470 --> 08:44.405
Coco Ding bats.

08:45.506 --> 08:46.384
My favourite!

08:47.475 --> 08:49.412
Honey? Now that's more like it.

08:52.515 --> 08:53.450
There you go, buddy.

08:53.649 --> 08:54.527
Don't worry.

08:54.650 --> 08:56.359
Nobody's driving.

08:56.486 --> 08:57.421
Hey, rabbit!

08:57.521 --> 08:59.594
You ain't leaving 'til you eat those
Coco Dingbats.

08:59.689 --> 09:02.502
This is the best guys' trip ever!

09:02.626 --> 09:05.507
Me and Dinkleman agree with you
one hundred percent!

09:05.630 --> 09:07.601
Rabbit loves Dinkleman.

09:07.698 --> 09:10.340
Dinkleman loves rabbit.

09:10.469 --> 09:11.404
Was what that, Dink?

09:11.503 --> 09:13.508
Can't go on guys' trip because
I'm married?

09:19.446 --> 09:21.485
No deer on guys' trip.

09:21.582 --> 09:24.554
Bla bla bla guys' trip.

09:26.622 --> 09:27.600
Dink?

09:27.623 --> 09:30.504
We gotta go somewhere
where folks don't let us down.

09:31.562 --> 09:32.566
Place where we fit in.

09:33.496 --> 09:34.500
A real home.

09:42.507 --> 09:43.442
A place like that.

09:43.576 --> 09:46.389
With other bears who totally get us.

09:46.645 --> 09:48.547
If only we knew what that was.

09:52.620 --> 09:53.555
Wait a minute.

10:00.629 --> 10:02.509
A place where no one lets you down.

10:03.599 --> 10:05.342
You stay here, rabbit.

10:05.435 --> 10:06.507
Keep your eye on the stash.

10:38.608 --> 10:39.586
Doug.

10:39.609 --> 10:41.489
Why do you always let me down?

10:41.578 --> 10:43.549
Circus in two days.

10:43.681 --> 10:46.528
You could at least pretend to care.

10:46.651 --> 10:49.361
Oh, was I supposed to catch you?

10:57.630 --> 10:58.508
How classy.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.638
Rehearsals over!

11:03.471 --> 11:04.509
I'm telling you, Alistair.

11:04.605 --> 11:07.577
One of these days, I'm gonna give
that diva a piece of my mind.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.418
I'm sure you will.

11:09.511 --> 11:11.391
I mean. Back where I came from.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.360
I know. The zoo.

11:13.449 --> 11:14.521
No.. No.. No...

11:14.650 --> 11:15.620
For the last time.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.495
It's the Wild Animal Park.

11:17.588 --> 11:18.558
There's a difference, you know?

11:18.689 --> 11:19.567
Anyway.

11:19.690 --> 11:22.366
When I was in the Wild Animal Park.

11:22.493 --> 11:23.497
No one treated me like that.

11:23.627 --> 11:25.438
All the animals worshiped me.

11:25.530 --> 11:26.568
There was one grizzly.

11:26.698 --> 11:28.407
One king of the jungle.

11:28.534 --> 11:29.512
Me.

11:29.535 --> 11:31.415
Oh... See....

11:31.537 --> 11:32.541
Just as soon as we get out of here.

11:32.671 --> 11:35.450
We're gonna find a place just like that.

11:35.575 --> 11:36.613
And I won't forget your help.

11:36.710 --> 11:38.419
I'll be king.

11:38.512 --> 11:40.551
And you'll be.

11:40.647 --> 11:42.493
Well, we'll find something
for you to be.

11:42.617 --> 11:44.519
- Oh?
- OK, here's the plan.

11:44.619 --> 11:45.589
You lift the cart.

11:45.721 --> 11:47.464
And we'd both squeezed through.

11:47.556 --> 11:48.434
Go on.

11:48.557 --> 11:49.458
Give it a try.

11:49.591 --> 11:51.437
You want me to pull something?

11:51.562 --> 11:53.635
Have I ever done you wrong before?

12:07.481 --> 12:09.486
You promise to take me with you?

12:09.616 --> 12:10.551
Of course I will.

12:10.651 --> 12:12.531
- You're the Yin to my.
- Yang.

12:12.654 --> 12:13.532
What? No!

12:13.655 --> 12:15.501
What kind of word is Yang?

12:15.590 --> 12:16.525
I was thinking more like.

12:16.624 --> 12:18.595
You're the 'Yin' to help me get 'Yout'!

12:18.693 --> 12:20.573
Now let's hurry up
before someone sees us.

12:22.598 --> 12:23.476
Come on.

12:23.599 --> 12:24.603
What are you waiting for?

12:34.545 --> 12:35.549
A little help?

12:35.646 --> 12:36.524
Please?

12:36.648 --> 12:38.528
Now you're supervising, that's good.

12:38.617 --> 12:40.588
You want something done?

12:40.687 --> 12:42.396
You gotta do it yourself.

12:44.624 --> 12:45.502
Too heavy!

12:45.759 --> 12:47.602
Doug!

12:47.595 --> 12:49.532
Ssshh. Someone will hear you.

12:51.665 --> 12:52.543
Yeah, I know.

12:52.666 --> 12:54.375
We need another set of arms.

12:55.704 --> 12:57.413
Hey, I'm upset too.

12:57.506 --> 12:58.544
You can't take this on personal?

12:58.674 --> 13:00.417
We all have our limitations?

13:00.643 --> 13:01.521
Oh, hey!

13:01.644 --> 13:03.490
That wheel's on your hoof.

13:03.580 --> 13:04.550
Doesn't that hurt?

13:07.519 --> 13:08.523
Now where were we?

13:08.754 --> 13:09.632
Oh yeah.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.498
We need another set of arms.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.594
Question is.

13:12.691 --> 13:13.661
Where to find it?

13:16.496 --> 13:17.374
Protect me!

13:18.665 --> 13:20.545
What in the world?

13:31.748 --> 13:34.424
Ho! Another grizzly in the flesh!

13:34.551 --> 13:37.523
You don't know how long
I've waited for this day.

13:38.522 --> 13:40.629
Yo, you got some kind of thing
coming out of your neck.

13:40.759 --> 13:42.605
I know. It's called Alistair.

13:42.761 --> 13:44.641
Hola! Comme es ta?

13:45.664 --> 13:46.634
What do you want, bear?

13:46.731 --> 13:48.406
The name's, Boog.

13:48.534 --> 13:50.471
Man! Another grizzly?

13:50.570 --> 13:51.608
This will be so great!

13:51.704 --> 13:53.641
We'll go fishing, have rabbit fights.

13:53.774 --> 13:55.381
Be best friends!

14:02.684 --> 14:04.393
She's here too?

14:04.486 --> 14:06.423
Hold up. Are you talking about Ursa?

14:06.555 --> 14:08.435
She's difficult to catch.

14:09.759 --> 14:11.605
Bear-vana? Listen Boog.

14:11.728 --> 14:14.507
We're busy here. Go back
to where you came from, okay?

14:14.599 --> 14:15.569
Back where I came from?

14:16.701 --> 14:17.579
Back there.

14:17.703 --> 14:18.638
I'm the only bear.

14:18.771 --> 14:21.447
- The only bear?
- Yeah.

14:21.573 --> 14:23.384
- All the other animals? They...
- Worship you?

14:23.510 --> 14:24.545
What?

14:24.544 --> 14:26.424
Oh yeah, that sounds fantastic.

14:26.513 --> 14:27.391
Didn't you hear me?

14:27.515 --> 14:28.689
I said I'm the only bear.

14:28.782 --> 14:31.526
You must be so lonely.

14:31.653 --> 14:34.500
The only lonely bear.

14:35.524 --> 14:36.459
That's very sad.

14:36.591 --> 14:38.471
I promise I wouldn't do this but.

14:44.768 --> 14:47.615
Right. Right. Sounds terrible.

14:47.704 --> 14:49.584
- I'm fighting this one.
- Give me just a second.

14:50.575 --> 14:51.545
What are you doing?

14:51.676 --> 14:53.453
Don't you see this is our chance?

14:53.545 --> 14:55.686
We get the bear to help us move the
carts and we're out of here!

14:55.781 --> 14:58.423
But the circus will miss us!

14:58.551 --> 15:00.431
They'll send a search party!

15:00.520 --> 15:01.398
You're right.

15:01.721 --> 15:02.599
I'll go.

15:03.523 --> 15:05.425
- But you. But you.
- Trust me.

15:05.560 --> 15:06.530
I got it all figured out.

15:07.562 --> 15:08.497
Listen, Boog.

15:08.629 --> 15:11.476
You and me? We're gonna do
all those things you talked about.

15:11.599 --> 15:13.501
Fishing, camping.

15:13.602 --> 15:14.606
- Oh, and rabbit fights?
- Sure!

15:14.703 --> 15:16.549
Girls, rabbits, whatever you want.

15:16.672 --> 15:18.483
So here's what I'm gonna do for you!

15:18.675 --> 15:21.579
I'm gonna find a place where we can
all be best friends together.

15:21.711 --> 15:22.589
Really?

15:22.713 --> 15:24.422
You'd do that for me?

15:24.615 --> 15:26.426
In a bear-minute.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.624
We're grizzlies.
Gotta look out for each other.

15:29.653 --> 15:30.588
So, here's the thing.

15:30.791 --> 15:33.604
We gotta swap places so the circus
doesn't know I'm gone.

15:33.726 --> 15:35.537
But I come back tomorrow night.

15:35.629 --> 15:36.667
And you, me and Ursa.

15:36.763 --> 15:38.540
- We go on a kind of..
- Bears' trip?

15:39.667 --> 15:40.545
Yeah, sure.

15:41.536 --> 15:42.414
Bears' trip.

15:42.670 --> 15:43.548
Together.

15:43.672 --> 15:45.483
Alright! I'm in.

15:45.608 --> 15:46.486
Great.

15:46.608 --> 15:48.488
Now hold still for just a second.

15:49.745 --> 15:51.625
Keep it down and stop moving

15:53.550 --> 15:54.428
Oh yeah.

15:54.551 --> 15:55.452
This is gonna work!

15:55.720 --> 15:57.429
Now what about me?

15:57.522 --> 15:58.560
Hey, like you said.

15:58.689 --> 16:01.536
If they figure out you're missing,
they'll send a search party.

16:01.660 --> 16:05.440
Don't worry. I'll bring someone back
tomorrow night to swap with you.

16:07.733 --> 16:10.477
When I say three, lift as hard as you
can.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.481
Got it?

16:11.604 --> 16:12.482
Got it.

16:12.606 --> 16:14.679
One, two, three.

16:22.718 --> 16:26.464
You'd better hide that doll
so nobody gets suspicious.

16:26.556 --> 16:27.628
- What doll?
- That one.

16:28.524 --> 16:29.402
In your hand.

16:29.525 --> 16:30.495
You mean Dinkleman?

16:30.594 --> 16:31.598
He ain't no doll!

16:31.795 --> 16:33.436
He's my bro!

16:33.564 --> 16:34.442
My boy!

16:34.566 --> 16:35.467
My Blouse

16:35.567 --> 16:36.502
Right.

16:37.769 --> 16:41.640
Hey, so where's that all for only bear
place you were talking about?

16:41.739 --> 16:44.586
You know, just so I make sure
I stay away from it.

16:44.711 --> 16:47.615
Over the mountain, pass forest
and down by the stream.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.526
Cool! Thanks!

16:49.750 --> 16:51.561
See you tomorrow night!

16:59.629 --> 17:01.440
When can I meet Ursa?

17:03.534 --> 17:05.414
Perhaps it's better to do that
in the morning.

17:05.536 --> 17:06.506
When you're a little more.

17:06.604 --> 17:07.574
Awake. No?

17:08.707 --> 17:10.587
I don't know why I'm so tired.

17:10.675 --> 17:12.417
Oh.. Si...

17:12.545 --> 17:13.651
Could it be the chocolates?

17:13.746 --> 17:16.422
So, what are you?

17:16.549 --> 17:19.453
- Some kind of Iama?
- I'm an Argentinian Carnelian.

17:19.551 --> 17:21.625
What's an Argentinian Carnelian?

17:21.722 --> 17:23.464
It's a kind of lama.

17:24.726 --> 17:25.604
Nice digs.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.565
I just want you to know.

17:27.829 --> 17:30.539
That it is very sympathetic.

17:30.666 --> 17:32.603
That you came all this way.

17:32.701 --> 17:34.706
Just to meet another grizzly.

17:50.823 --> 17:53.704
Oh, Mr. Weenie, mommy's going
to miss you so much.

17:54.761 --> 17:56.641
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

17:58.532 --> 17:59.410
Now remember.

17:59.534 --> 18:00.606
Play nice with everybody.

18:02.637 --> 18:03.641
Ready for your third dinner?

18:12.616 --> 18:13.594
Yumm.

18:13.717 --> 18:16.530
Mommy and Bob are going to look
for Big Foot.

18:16.654 --> 18:17.624
Okay, sugar plum?

18:17.755 --> 18:18.633
Remember.

18:18.756 --> 18:20.533
Mommy loves you!

18:22.595 --> 18:23.667
Is she always like this?

18:23.796 --> 18:25.471
Yeah, but it's not so bad.

18:25.765 --> 18:28.578
And my friends!
It's so good to see you all!

18:28.668 --> 18:30.548
- Hey, you too!
- You look great.

18:30.637 --> 18:32.642
Weenie, it's been ages.

18:33.841 --> 18:35.550
Thank you for it.

18:36.577 --> 18:37.555
Why?

18:37.713 --> 18:39.456
Who is our new friend?

18:39.581 --> 18:40.585
I'd like you to meet Nate.

18:40.682 --> 18:42.619
Nate, meet Mr. Weenie.

18:43.619 --> 18:44.691
He's a strong silent type.

18:44.821 --> 18:45.799
You!

18:45.823 --> 18:49.569
Are trying my patience!

18:49.660 --> 18:50.630
Come on! Work you!

18:50.761 --> 18:53.471
Work! Work! Work!

18:58.771 --> 19:00.582
- Fussy. -Yeah?

19:00.706 --> 19:01.676
- Nine?
- Yeah?

19:01.774 --> 19:03.449
- Nine? -Yeah.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.685
- You know, some animals are much
kinder once they've been. - Fixed!

19:06.780 --> 19:09.559
Oh... Hi...

19:09.717 --> 19:10.595
Mr. Weenie.

19:10.719 --> 19:12.530
Come and sit with me.

19:12.655 --> 19:15.627
We can watch the television together.

19:15.725 --> 19:17.605
He's not still mad at me, is he?

19:17.727 --> 19:19.698
I think his angry days are behind him.

19:19.830 --> 19:21.471
If you know what I mean.

19:21.565 --> 19:25.436
One night only!
The great Maslova Family Circus!

19:25.570 --> 19:26.676
Hey! That's Boog!

19:26.771 --> 19:30.619
I don't remember Boog's fur being so
light and spiky like that.

19:30.742 --> 19:33.623
Listen, I know Boog as 'Zat' guy Boog!

19:33.746 --> 19:36.718
If that is Boog,
he sure looks terrible.

19:36.817 --> 19:38.628
Of course he looks terrible!

19:38.718 --> 19:40.564
They're trying to kill him!

19:40.688 --> 19:41.692
This is horrible!

19:41.789 --> 19:42.724
Look out, Boog!

19:44.793 --> 19:45.671
Poor Boog.

19:45.794 --> 19:47.469
We have to do something!

19:47.596 --> 19:48.668
Let's go save him!

19:48.763 --> 19:50.609
Oh, I wanna go save him.

19:50.733 --> 19:52.635
Oh please, please, please, please.

19:52.735 --> 19:53.613
We must hurry!

19:53.737 --> 19:56.618
How? Have you noticed?
We're in the air stream.

19:56.739 --> 19:57.674
There's no way out of here.

19:57.808 --> 19:59.585
How are we gonna save him?

20:04.649 --> 20:06.688
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

20:06.785 --> 20:07.763
No.

20:07.786 --> 20:09.688
But if we climb out of that vent.

20:09.822 --> 20:11.702
I could track us to the circus.

20:11.791 --> 20:13.432
To save Boog.

20:13.860 --> 20:15.740
Yeah, the coast is clear!

20:17.797 --> 20:19.677
Keep it moving, keep it moving!

20:19.800 --> 20:20.701
Keep it moving.

20:20.801 --> 20:21.702
Relax, Fifi.

20:21.836 --> 20:24.580
Remember what the vet said
about staying calm?

20:24.674 --> 20:25.575
You stay calm!

20:25.708 --> 20:28.646
With 500 pounds of animal on your back!

20:30.781 --> 20:32.490
Nice stitches!

20:36.621 --> 20:37.556
Marshmallows?

20:38.757 --> 20:39.635
Slightly burned.

20:41.761 --> 20:43.470
Mixed with enoki.

20:43.563 --> 20:44.567
Robust poop!

20:44.665 --> 20:46.545
What's with you always with the poop?

20:47.668 --> 20:48.740
The circus! This way!

20:50.872 --> 20:51.750
I'm okay.

20:51.872 --> 20:52.750
I'm okay.

20:55.810 --> 20:56.688
Come on.

20:56.845 --> 20:59.589
Who's up for a rabbit fight?

20:59.682 --> 21:01.562
Can't we wait for uncle Boog
to get back?

21:01.685 --> 21:03.531
He was supposed to be home last night.

21:03.620 --> 21:06.467
Yeah! Do you think he's still mad at you
for ditching him on guys' trip?

21:06.590 --> 21:09.562
He can stay on guys' trip forever
as far as I'm concerned.

21:10.761 --> 21:11.696
What does he think?

21:11.829 --> 21:13.470
That I can just, you know.

21:13.598 --> 21:17.503
Leave the kids alone, while Giselle
visits the mother in law of doom?

21:17.603 --> 21:19.676
- Dad.
- Children needs constant attention.

21:19.772 --> 21:21.743
- You ignore them for one second.
- Dad!

21:23.576 --> 21:24.750
Come here, Little E.

21:25.778 --> 21:27.487
You're not going rogue, son.

21:27.781 --> 21:29.490
Dad, let's just play, okay?

21:29.650 --> 21:30.528
Good idea.

21:30.752 --> 21:32.461
We don't need uncle Boog.

21:32.587 --> 21:33.761
Rabbit fights are way more fun
without him anyway.

21:34.623 --> 21:35.501
You're out.

21:35.758 --> 21:36.636
Gotcha.

21:38.729 --> 21:39.607
New game?

21:39.731 --> 21:41.702
Well, that's enough fun for one day.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.713
Now can we wait for uncle Boog
to come back?

21:43.835 --> 21:45.681
Boog, Boog, Boog.

21:45.770 --> 21:48.549
From now on, we will no longer
mention his name.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.679
Okay ....

21:49.808 --> 21:51.617
So...

21:51.610 --> 21:52.682
What do you wanna play next?

21:52.779 --> 21:54.659
Well, how about a game of.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.650
Shrub.. Jump?

21:56.784 --> 21:59.722
Diving?
Where we jump into the nearest shrub.

21:59.820 --> 22:01.631
And uh.. Come on Elvis,
I'll show you.

22:01.756 --> 22:02.726
Dad! No!

22:02.823 --> 22:04.600
It's poison ivy!

22:09.666 --> 22:11.512
It's part of the game.

22:11.601 --> 22:14.482
Whoever scratches first.

22:14.705 --> 22:15.583
Loses!

22:18.877 --> 22:19.855
Lwin!

22:22.747 --> 22:24.627
Ooh, that has gotta hurt.

22:24.883 --> 22:26.763
Well played, Little E.

22:26.886 --> 22:28.629
Okay, who's hungry?

22:31.725 --> 22:32.703
Dad.

22:33.626 --> 22:34.527
We need uncle B.

22:34.695 --> 22:35.573
I mean.

22:35.830 --> 22:37.539
We need someone.

22:37.664 --> 22:38.565
Taller.

22:38.666 --> 22:40.603
- To reach a branch that high.
- Not so.

22:40.835 --> 22:43.716
Who knows more about getting honey
than adeer, huh?

22:43.872 --> 22:45.547
Come here, Little E.

22:53.618 --> 22:54.622
Spine so frail.

23:02.595 --> 23:03.573
Dad?

23:03.596 --> 23:04.634
Quiet, Gisella.

23:04.765 --> 23:06.770
The slightest sound could wake the bees.

23:14.809 --> 23:17.790
Bees!

23:20.616 --> 23:22.587
At least getting stung will take
his mind off the itching.

23:22.786 --> 23:23.696
Yeah.

23:33.699 --> 23:34.771
Hey! Keep it down!

23:36.769 --> 23:37.773
Too much chocolate.

23:43.844 --> 23:45.587
Hey, why did you do that?

23:45.679 --> 23:46.557
Just hold still.

23:49.684 --> 23:51.564
Give a little poof over here.

23:51.653 --> 23:52.759
A tease over there.

23:52.854 --> 23:54.495
A pull, a tug.

23:54.590 --> 23:55.628
A comb.

23:55.758 --> 23:58.571
Make it snappy.
I am a genius.

23:58.761 --> 24:00.641
Get a camera, because you are.

24:01.699 --> 24:02.577
Perfecto!

24:02.834 --> 24:04.736
The spitting image.

24:04.837 --> 24:06.739
They will never know the difference.

24:06.871 --> 24:09.752
Now, let us go dance.

24:09.842 --> 24:12.586
Doug is here everybody!

24:13.780 --> 24:16.559
Remember what they say about not talking.

24:16.684 --> 24:18.689
If you don't have something nice to say?

24:21.723 --> 24:22.795
She's beautiful.

24:29.633 --> 24:30.671
I see what's going on here.

24:31.668 --> 24:32.706
What are you talking about?

24:32.836 --> 24:33.771
Nothing's going on here.

24:34.705 --> 24:35.683
Okay.

24:36.641 --> 24:37.519
I'm serious.

24:37.608 --> 24:38.714
Hm-hm?

24:38.844 --> 24:41.588
Hey, I'm just happy to meet
another grizzly. That's all.

24:41.813 --> 24:42.783
Whatever you say.

24:42.881 --> 24:45.694
Tiger. Show me your strength.

24:50.691 --> 24:51.569
So uh...

24:51.692 --> 24:52.593
Hey, Ursa.

24:52.726 --> 24:55.630
- I thought I'd introduce myself,
because you know. - Doug?

24:55.764 --> 24:57.575
Why is voice low?

24:57.833 --> 24:59.542
Are you again. To be sick?

24:59.668 --> 25:00.740
Oh! Um.

25:01.703 --> 25:03.674
- I'm not actually.
- You'd better not be.

25:03.806 --> 25:04.784
No!

25:04.807 --> 25:06.709
I mean, um.. Hey!

25:06.843 --> 25:08.518
Watch it with that stick, little dude!

25:08.645 --> 25:09.717
Come on, Doug. Arms up!

25:09.846 --> 25:11.783
Why must we go through this everyday?

25:11.916 --> 25:13.523
A little bribe, perhaps?

25:13.617 --> 25:14.757
It's chocolate! You love chocolate.

25:14.886 --> 25:16.663
- Come on, arms up!
- Please.

25:16.789 --> 25:17.724
Now, we are ready.

25:17.856 --> 25:18.734
Let's begin.

25:23.664 --> 25:24.542
Right foot up!

25:24.732 --> 25:25.610
Left foot up!

25:25.733 --> 25:27.613
- Slower.
- Faster.

25:27.702 --> 25:28.703
Jump!

25:28.737 --> 25:29.638
Squat leg!

25:32.741 --> 25:33.813
- Stop!
- Wildly bear!

25:37.647 --> 25:38.525
Hit it!

25:47.859 --> 25:49.739
You can really move.

25:50.662 --> 25:51.540
You ready?

25:51.796 --> 25:53.607
Hey, I was born ready, baby.

25:57.637 --> 25:59.574
Wait, I'm not. I'm not ready for.

26:06.916 --> 26:09.797
Why can't you just once be there
when I need you?

26:09.918 --> 26:11.559
Oh wait!

26:11.654 --> 26:12.726
Ursa, let me explain.

26:13.622 --> 26:14.626
- I'm not.
- Doug!

26:14.758 --> 26:16.569
I don't want excuses.

26:16.693 --> 26:17.731
Maybe if you just.

26:17.827 --> 26:18.705
Cut the lift.

26:18.828 --> 26:19.706
- That's all.
- No, wait!

26:19.831 --> 26:21.768
I could've caught you.
It's just that I'm not.

26:21.866 --> 26:24.610
- Doug. Thanks a lot!
- Yeah, thanks Doug, okay?

26:24.737 --> 26:25.741
He only thinks all about himself.

26:25.837 --> 26:27.512
- Listen, I'm not.
- Doug.

26:27.640 --> 26:29.679
That was worse than yesterday.

26:32.813 --> 26:33.748
Oh, wait!

26:33.881 --> 26:34.882
Ursa.

26:34.882 --> 26:38.594
Uh.. Give her some time
to cool down maybe, okay?

26:38.687 --> 26:40.658
But I have to tell her who I really am.

26:41.656 --> 26:43.593
There will be plenty of time for that.

26:43.692 --> 26:46.766
When we are all living in Bear-vana.

26:47.697 --> 26:48.575
Trust me.

26:49.666 --> 26:50.670
If there is one thing I know.

26:50.767 --> 26:51.737
It is women.

26:51.869 --> 26:53.746
And.

26:53.771 --> 26:54.741
Musical theater.

26:54.839 --> 26:56.719
But that is not important right now.

26:56.908 --> 26:58.617
What is important.

26:58.844 --> 26:59.779
Is that women.

27:00.712 --> 27:03.650
Do not like to be rushed.

27:04.850 --> 27:06.661
Look, Alistair buddy.

27:06.786 --> 27:09.599
I wait in here until
Doug is back at sunset

27:09.723 --> 27:11.603
And everything is gonna be fine.

27:12.794 --> 27:13.672
Alright, Alistair.

27:13.794 --> 27:14.695
If you say so.

27:30.814 --> 27:32.660
Alright ladies, buckle up.

27:32.751 --> 27:35.598
- One two three four.
- Look, I'm flying!

27:38.823 --> 27:40.634
This must be the place.

27:40.726 --> 27:41.730
Bear-vana.

27:45.900 --> 27:46.778
Finally.

27:46.901 --> 27:47.802
I'm the only bear.

27:47.902 --> 27:50.544
And all the animals are gonna worship me.

27:50.639 --> 27:51.677
Just like they did Boog.

27:51.807 --> 27:53.653
Boog's back, everybody!

27:53.777 --> 27:55.782
- Boog!
- Thank goodness, he's back!

27:55.878 --> 27:57.689
- Yes.
- About time.

27:58.782 --> 27:59.717
Yeah, I know.

27:59.849 --> 28:01.626
It's good to finally be here.

28:01.752 --> 28:02.756
You look terrible!

28:02.887 --> 28:04.789
And your voice seems worse!

28:04.889 --> 28:07.668
Yeah. Complete Gaga girl.

28:07.793 --> 28:09.673
What are you talking about?

28:09.762 --> 28:11.664
My voice is as smooth as silk.

28:11.798 --> 28:13.609
Must have been rough out there.

28:13.700 --> 28:15.841
Rough? Yeah, it was rough alright.

28:15.935 --> 28:17.644
That's why I look terrible.

28:17.771 --> 28:18.741
My voice sounds like Ka-Ka.

28:18.872 --> 28:21.548
Now why don't you all run along
and fetch me some goodies?

28:21.642 --> 28:22.577
Goodies smoothies.

28:22.711 --> 28:24.713
Boog!

28:26.916 --> 28:27.894
Here.

28:27.884 --> 28:29.661
Hold these for a second.

28:29.784 --> 28:33.632
How dare you show your face around here?

28:33.756 --> 28:35.602
After what you've done?

28:37.728 --> 28:39.608
Gotta go polish my...

28:39.697 --> 28:40.735
Uh. Me too.

28:40.865 --> 28:41.743
Me three.

28:41.866 --> 28:42.844
Yeah.

28:43.702 --> 28:44.680
Dad.

28:44.703 --> 28:46.605
I thought you were going to apologise?

28:46.939 --> 28:47.817
Apologise?

28:47.941 --> 28:50.651
If anyone should apologise, it's him.

28:50.776 --> 28:51.654
To me.

28:51.778 --> 28:52.779
For.

28:52.779 --> 28:53.814
For.

28:54.916 --> 28:55.894
This!

28:56.719 --> 28:57.597
And this!

28:57.786 --> 28:58.664
Then this!

29:01.725 --> 29:02.703
Well?

29:04.694 --> 29:05.664
The silent treatment.

29:05.795 --> 29:07.800
Well, I too can play at that game.

29:07.931 --> 29:10.607
Only I'm not playing.

29:10.701 --> 29:12.706
I was fine before I met you.

29:12.804 --> 29:14.775
Oh, sure, I was tied
to the hood of the car.

29:14.873 --> 29:17.754
Sorry uncle Boog. Dad hasn't been the
same since you've been gone.

29:17.877 --> 29:20.758
Now look at me. A pathetic shell.

29:20.847 --> 29:25.753
And all because of you!

29:25.886 --> 29:27.732
It's too late now, Boog.

29:27.821 --> 29:28.722
This deer.

29:28.822 --> 29:29.792
Has sailed.

29:31.759 --> 29:32.637
Sorry uncle Boog.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.571
I hope you guys can work things out.

29:35.764 --> 29:36.742
Dad!

29:37.766 --> 29:39.646
We're all glad you're back, uncle Boog!

29:39.770 --> 29:43.709
That is one seriously messed up deer.

29:44.675 --> 29:45.610
That's better.

29:45.842 --> 29:46.846
Good to be myself again.

29:49.914 --> 29:51.623
Time to hit the road.

29:58.891 --> 29:59.869
Doug?

30:10.707 --> 30:11.711
He's not coming back.

30:11.841 --> 30:12.776
Give him a chance.

30:12.876 --> 30:13.811
It's still early.

30:13.944 --> 30:15.721
Besides, he's a grizzly.

30:15.846 --> 30:16.724
We're family.

30:20.752 --> 30:21.687
It's all a lie.

30:22.687 --> 30:23.827
There is no Bear-vana.

30:23.955 --> 30:25.857
Come on, Alistair. He'll be back.

30:26.792 --> 30:28.672
Grizzlies hate each other.

30:28.794 --> 30:30.571
It's in their genes.

30:30.697 --> 30:31.667
What are you talking about?

30:31.765 --> 30:32.803
Grizzlies don't hate each other.

30:32.933 --> 30:34.608
The mens do!

30:34.735 --> 30:37.673
They are to macho.

30:40.675 --> 30:42.748
Doug lied so you would help him escape.

30:43.712 --> 30:44.590
And I...

30:44.713 --> 30:47.594
I was his partner in crime!

30:49.718 --> 30:50.722
In crime!

30:53.757 --> 30:56.695
Who have I become?

30:58.963 --> 31:00.638
If Doug's not coming back.

31:01.733 --> 31:02.737
Then Ursa won't talk to me.

31:03.703 --> 31:04.673
What am I doing here?

31:20.724 --> 31:22.604
This one goes to my girlfriend.

31:22.726 --> 31:23.832
Out on the Pampas.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.864
I'm all alone.

31:26.997 --> 31:28.843
My heart.

31:28.933 --> 31:31.780
Has crushed to nada.

31:33.906 --> 31:35.786
I'm all alone.

31:41.949 --> 31:44.728
It won't work.

31:45.920 --> 31:48.858
Don't bother trying.

31:49.991 --> 31:55.705
If you try that.

31:55.798 --> 31:57.769
You'll go flying.

32:22.729 --> 32:23.699
What are you looking at?

32:23.864 --> 32:24.742
Nothing.

32:24.866 --> 32:25.870
That was. Well, you were.

32:26.868 --> 32:27.872
That was beautiful.

32:28.870 --> 32:30.807
You are making fun.

32:30.906 --> 32:31.784
No! No! Really!

32:33.811 --> 32:34.746
Listen, Ursa.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.659
I know you've got no reason to believe me.

32:37.782 --> 32:38.888
But I gotta tell you the truth!

32:38.983 --> 32:40.624
I'm not Doug.

32:40.785 --> 32:41.663
I'm Boog!

32:42.754 --> 32:43.632
You are right.

32:44.723 --> 32:45.727
I have no reason to believe you.

32:45.858 --> 32:47.897
Look. I never should've come here.

32:47.993 --> 32:48.871
I know that now.

32:48.996 --> 32:50.773
This was all a big mistake.

32:50.898 --> 32:52.800
Why is fur dark?

32:52.933 --> 32:53.811
Like I told you.

32:53.935 --> 32:55.610
I'm not Doug.

32:55.736 --> 32:56.614
I'm Boog.

32:56.803 --> 32:57.807
I was just you know.

32:57.905 --> 32:59.682
Looking for a place where I belong.

32:59.807 --> 33:02.620
So, if you just give me a hand moving
one of the carts.

33:02.745 --> 33:03.680
I'll be out of your hair.

33:03.779 --> 33:05.852
Oh, now I see truth.

33:05.982 --> 33:07.884
You want me to help you escape.

33:07.984 --> 33:09.659
And ruin circus!

33:09.786 --> 33:11.791
- No!
- You are pathetic, Doug.

33:11.889 --> 33:13.735
No, Ursa, seriously.

33:13.857 --> 33:14.758
I just.

33:29.810 --> 33:30.745
You twanged?

33:30.911 --> 33:31.889
No.

33:31.913 --> 33:34.589
Okay, 'cos I thought I heard my name.

33:34.715 --> 33:35.685
It doesn't matter.

33:35.784 --> 33:38.665
I. Just want you to know that.

33:38.754 --> 33:39.724
I am sorry.

33:40.756 --> 33:42.863
I really thought Doug was my best friend.

33:42.958 --> 33:43.859
That's okay.

33:43.993 --> 33:46.669
I suck at picking best friends too.

33:46.764 --> 33:48.644
Are we good? You and me?

33:48.766 --> 33:49.744
Yeah!

33:49.768 --> 33:50.646
We're good.

33:50.835 --> 33:51.713
Excellente.

33:51.903 --> 33:55.774
I promise I will never tell you
I'm coming back when I'm not.

33:55.908 --> 33:57.719
And I promise I'll make time for you..

33:57.811 --> 34:00.590
Even when I got a bunch of
important things going on.

34:00.714 --> 34:01.786
- Amigos?
- Yeah!

34:01.882 --> 34:02.783
Amigos.

34:02.917 --> 34:04.694
This is nice.

34:04.919 --> 34:05.923
Talking like this.

34:06.021 --> 34:08.663
We will do this every night.

34:08.856 --> 34:10.860
A kind of. Guys chat.

34:10.958 --> 34:11.937
Si?

34:12.728 --> 34:13.606
Guys chat?

34:13.830 --> 34:14.708
I like that.

34:14.831 --> 34:16.835
Good, okay, so...

34:17.833 --> 34:21.648
Since you're stuck here.
A little advice, okay?

34:21.739 --> 34:23.641
The way to a woman's heart.

34:24.007 --> 34:24.886
Is through.

34:25.010 --> 34:25.987
Her.

34:26.010 --> 34:26.987
Art.

34:33.786 --> 34:34.790
The circus is coming!

34:34.920 --> 34:37.699
How can a circus be coming?
A circus is a tent.

34:37.824 --> 34:39.762
With posts, stuck in the ground!

34:39.860 --> 34:40.762
This is a highway!

34:46.034 --> 34:47.880
Oh no! No!

34:48.771 --> 34:49.649
Thank you.

34:51.840 --> 34:52.717
We made it.

34:52.842 --> 34:53.914
That wasn't easy.

34:54.010 --> 34:56.822
- This still doesn't look like a circus.
- Strange.

34:57.848 --> 34:59.659
It sure smells like it.

35:00.786 --> 35:01.764
No!

35:01.787 --> 35:03.689
I need those! I need those!

35:03.822 --> 35:04.792
I need them!

35:05.959 --> 35:07.668
There you go, baby.

35:08.027 --> 35:08.905
Just like new.

35:10.865 --> 35:13.871
- Hi, how's it going, Stew?
- So far so good.

35:14.002 --> 35:15.779
I got your balloon order.

35:16.004 --> 35:17.713
How could you have been so wrong?

35:17.806 --> 35:18.684
I don't know?

35:18.807 --> 35:19.777
Maybe it's allergy.

35:19.875 --> 35:20.753
Wait a minute.

35:20.875 --> 35:21.845
Look in the window!

35:21.944 --> 35:25.621
The circus poster will tell us
where to find Boog.

35:25.748 --> 35:26.626
Quickly!

35:26.750 --> 35:27.754
Before we are seen!

35:27.985 --> 35:29.694
There you go, baby.

35:29.820 --> 35:33.896
Wait 'til you see the super balloon
bouquet I whipped up for ya.

35:36.828 --> 35:39.709
Nice exploration of negative space.

35:39.832 --> 35:41.803
Hurry up! I should be on top!

35:41.901 --> 35:42.905
- I should be on the top!
- A little closer!

35:43.036 --> 35:45.849
- Don't wave!
- Nine, a little closer.

35:45.939 --> 35:48.649
Meat snack.

35:48.776 --> 35:49.848
Look, they're colored.

35:49.944 --> 35:51.653
It's perfect replacement.

35:51.779 --> 35:52.657
I need those.

35:52.780 --> 35:53.886
Hey! Stop that!

35:54.016 --> 35:55.793
We have been discovered!

35:55.884 --> 35:58.663
You just. Hey!

35:58.754 --> 35:59.632
Come back here!

36:00.757 --> 36:01.735
No!

36:01.925 --> 36:02.860
I'm gonna get you!

36:03.926 --> 36:04.804
Get back here!

36:15.908 --> 36:16.786
Gotcha!

36:18.846 --> 36:19.724
Meat Snack!

36:23.985 --> 36:24.863
Meat Snack.

36:24.986 --> 36:25.864
Come back here!

36:33.997 --> 36:35.877
You knew you were going
to this guys' trip.

36:35.999 --> 36:38.675
For two whole weeks before you told him.

36:38.770 --> 36:39.944
Maybe I should go talk to him.

36:40.037 --> 36:42.747
Hold it right there, big fella.

36:42.841 --> 36:43.879
So you forgot.

36:44.042 --> 36:45.888
If he was a real friend.

36:45.978 --> 36:48.654
- He'd understand.
- You're absolutely right!

36:48.780 --> 36:49.920
Boog is a real friend.

36:50.015 --> 36:52.725
Your life is a mess without him.

36:52.852 --> 36:54.925
By mess you mean awesome!

36:55.022 --> 36:55.900
No, I mean mess!

36:56.023 --> 36:57.664
- Awesome!
- Stop that!

36:57.792 --> 36:58.932
- Enough!
- Dad?

37:01.830 --> 37:02.708
Girls.

37:02.830 --> 37:03.800
I was just.

37:04.833 --> 37:05.711
Not important.

37:05.834 --> 37:07.645
So, is it breakfast time again?

37:07.770 --> 37:08.842
Lunch? Dinner? Play time?

37:09.772 --> 37:10.946
Is it a dope problem?

37:11.040 --> 37:12.817
What's a dope problem?

37:12.909 --> 37:13.844
Nothing, what's up?

37:14.044 --> 37:15.855
Mom always says that.

37:18.016 --> 37:19.793
You should try and work things out.

37:21.987 --> 37:23.696
You're upset with me?

37:24.056 --> 37:25.697
You're right!

37:25.791 --> 37:27.693
I've been a complete failure.

37:27.828 --> 37:31.676
How can you ever forgive me?

37:31.933 --> 37:34.746
We were talking about you and uncle Boog?

37:34.870 --> 37:35.942
You should go talk to him.

37:38.807 --> 37:41.711
Or maybe we should go and get uncle Boog.

37:41.811 --> 37:42.849
Bring him. Here.

37:44.947 --> 37:46.827
And you're not a complete failure.

37:47.885 --> 37:48.820
You're a dad.

37:48.953 --> 37:50.799
We love you no matter what.

37:51.957 --> 37:53.666
Father?

37:55.995 --> 37:56.873
It's okay.

38:00.866 --> 38:01.938
All for the taking.

38:02.034 --> 38:03.845
Hey Boog! Can you help me with my digging?

38:03.971 --> 38:06.875
Can you help me get my wife
unstacked from the pine?

38:06.975 --> 38:08.786
- What.
- Can you help me with my nuts?

38:08.876 --> 38:10.687
- I mean...
- Thought we were gonna mark the perimeter?

38:10.812 --> 38:11.884
- Hold on!
- What about our habitat?

38:12.014 --> 38:13.757
- Yeah!
- Hey Boog, can you help me with thing?

38:17.853 --> 38:19.926
Do you think dad and uncle Boog will
ever forgive each other?

38:20.056 --> 38:22.698
What's going to happen if they don't?

38:23.059 --> 38:23.937
Enough!

38:24.829 --> 38:25.707
Enough!

38:25.830 --> 38:30.770
Enough!

38:34.873 --> 38:35.843
I'm not your servant!

38:37.810 --> 38:38.814
I'm king of the jungle!

38:38.945 --> 38:41.883
Well, technically the lion
is the king of the jungle.

38:42.017 --> 38:43.863
And this is the forest.

38:43.985 --> 38:45.865
A jungle tends to be denser and hotter.

38:45.955 --> 38:47.732
- Deer!
- What?

38:47.824 --> 38:48.702
I travel.

38:48.824 --> 38:50.795
Fine! Then I'm king of the forest!

38:50.994 --> 38:51.872
Either way.

38:51.994 --> 38:53.805
Things are gonna change around here.

38:53.930 --> 38:55.935
You! Go get me some nice ripped berries.

38:56.066 --> 38:59.812
And you two. Find me a good waterfall
where I can have a nice soak.

38:59.971 --> 39:00.906
And you Doily!

39:01.806 --> 39:02.684
Riley!

39:02.808 --> 39:03.743
Whatever!

39:03.843 --> 39:06.815
You and your guys go build me
a nice comfortable bed.

39:06.913 --> 39:07.848
Up on that hill.

39:07.948 --> 39:10.727
Don't you mean in your cave?

39:10.851 --> 39:12.788
Oh, yeah.

39:12.886 --> 39:13.821
My cave.

39:15.890 --> 39:16.868
Move!

39:16.991 --> 39:18.700
Better do what he says.

39:18.793 --> 39:19.831
He's gone bluhnicaccasl

39:21.830 --> 39:22.936
He has really lost it.

39:23.065 --> 39:24.706
- Yeah.
- Could be stress.

39:24.800 --> 39:25.838
Big mad bear disease.

39:25.968 --> 39:27.745
It could be stupid deer disease.

39:27.837 --> 39:29.683
Seriously? Is that going around?

39:29.806 --> 39:32.949
Maybe we've all been taking him for
granted a little too much.

39:45.825 --> 39:47.705
Oh! Hello girls.

39:47.994 --> 39:49.931
How long have you two been standing there?

39:50.030 --> 39:51.705
We just uh.

39:51.899 --> 39:52.834
Got here?

39:54.069 --> 39:54.947
What is that?

39:55.070 --> 39:56.847
Some kind of nervous tick?

39:58.074 --> 39:58.952
Nervous?

39:59.976 --> 40:01.753
Who's nervous?

40:01.878 --> 40:02.882
What do you girls want?

40:02.979 --> 40:04.825
We just wanted to say.

40:04.948 --> 40:05.918
How glad we are that you're back.

40:06.050 --> 40:07.028
Bye!

40:11.089 --> 40:13.970
Hey. Perhaps Boog is uh. Changing

40:14.092 --> 40:16.734
- That's not it.
- We change all the time, huh?

40:17.063 --> 40:19.910
Just yesterday.
Deni, he's in love with foei gras.

40:20.034 --> 40:21.743
Then I tell him what it is, and.

40:21.835 --> 40:22.805
He can't talk, he can't sleep.

40:22.937 --> 40:24.714
He saved me.

40:24.805 --> 40:25.877
Can you just go and find our mom?

40:26.006 --> 40:26.907
Please?

40:27.042 --> 40:28.819
I'll be your best friend.

40:28.910 --> 40:30.915
Alright, alright, you twist my wing.

40:31.012 --> 40:33.756
But only because the two of you
are so good.

40:33.883 --> 40:34.955
Thank you Serge!

40:35.051 --> 40:37.761
- You guys rock!
- Deni, follow my tail!

40:40.824 --> 40:41.759
What do you think?

40:42.059 --> 40:45.873
Your tie is a smart bow tie.

40:46.030 --> 40:46.908
Perfecto!

40:47.866 --> 40:49.803
I see you're sweating.

40:49.935 --> 40:51.837
Nervous anticipation.

40:51.937 --> 40:52.907
What are you talking about?

40:53.006 --> 40:54.943
- I'm not sweating?
- Yes, you are.

40:55.041 --> 40:58.787
I see a little drop of moisture
on your upper brow.

40:58.945 --> 40:59.823
Right there.

40:59.980 --> 41:02.793
- Hello little sweat.
- Yeah, sweat.

41:02.884 --> 41:03.762
Right.

41:03.885 --> 41:06.789
Nothing to worry! You're gonna
knock her out with the real you!

41:06.889 --> 41:08.700
She'd be like. Doug!

41:08.825 --> 41:09.726
Who is Doug?

41:09.927 --> 41:11.829
I'm all about Boog, baby!

41:11.929 --> 41:14.708
There is something different about Doug.

41:14.832 --> 41:16.837
Looks like someone got a
hair brush for birthday.

41:23.008 --> 41:24.854
- Still think I'm Doug?
- Yes.

41:27.047 --> 41:27.925
How about now?

41:28.916 --> 41:30.818
What are you trying to prove, Doug?

41:30.951 --> 41:31.921
That I'm Boog!

41:32.052 --> 41:33.727
Let's try the ladder.

41:33.821 --> 41:34.756
Oh, forget it.

41:38.092 --> 41:40.768
- Well, can you ride.
- Unicycle?

41:42.097 --> 41:43.704
Check this out.

41:44.968 --> 41:45.946
See?

41:45.969 --> 41:46.847
I'm Boog!

41:48.039 --> 41:50.852
Look, I'm sorry we got off
on the wrong foot.

41:50.941 --> 41:51.911
But once you get to know me.

41:52.009 --> 41:52.979
The real me.

41:53.110 --> 41:55.718
- You might like me.
- Leave me alone!

42:05.825 --> 42:06.863
Doug was afraid of heights.

42:06.993 --> 42:08.964
If you're really Boog.

42:09.063 --> 42:11.705
Why don't you come up here and prove it?

42:11.899 --> 42:12.777
Don't give up.

42:12.901 --> 42:13.871
Follow her.

42:13.969 --> 42:15.974
She wants you to.

42:16.938 --> 42:18.818
That's. Pretty high.

42:19.877 --> 42:20.881
You're probably right.

42:24.082 --> 42:26.724
That impressed a pretty girl.

42:26.851 --> 42:28.025
- Hm.
- Just go!

42:30.990 --> 42:33.769
One can't help but be moved, no?

42:48.911 --> 42:49.915
Now you believe me?

42:50.112 --> 42:52.822
I believed you when you
ride the unicycle.

42:52.949 --> 42:54.760
Doug couldn't do that either.

42:54.851 --> 42:56.992
You mean you made me climb
all the way up here for nothing?

42:57.121 --> 42:58.728
Not for nothing.

42:58.822 --> 43:00.724
You need to be punished
for juggling the dog.

43:11.904 --> 43:12.882
Boog.

43:13.073 --> 43:14.782
What a nice name.

43:17.945 --> 43:19.916
If you want to practice the dance.

43:21.015 --> 43:21.950
Meet me outside.

43:24.052 --> 43:25.761
You put a girl in grizzly!

43:29.926 --> 43:33.797
Cats, tonight, you're gonna
play your little whiskers off.

43:33.931 --> 43:35.003
And a one and a two.

43:35.100 --> 43:39.779
Miaw, miaw, miaw, miaw...

43:40.072 --> 43:43.977
Miaw, miaw, miaw, miaw...

43:45.111 --> 43:48.720
Miaw, miaw, miaw, miaw...

43:48.849 --> 43:49.887
You dance very well, Boog.

43:50.885 --> 43:51.763
I practiced.

43:51.885 --> 43:54.732
I figured you might trip me
or something if I messed up.

43:54.923 --> 43:55.901
Me?

43:55.924 --> 43:57.030
I would never do that.

43:57.893 --> 43:59.773
Yeah, but I might.

43:59.995 --> 44:00.965
So you'd better watch yourself.

44:06.136 --> 44:07.845
Oh, definitely looking good.

44:09.007 --> 44:10.887
You are not like other bears.

44:11.976 --> 44:12.854
Why is this?

44:12.977 --> 44:13.855
I don't know.

44:13.978 --> 44:15.949
Maybe it's because
I grew up with humans.

44:16.081 --> 44:16.959
Really?

44:17.082 --> 44:18.962
Me too!
I grew up in circus!

44:19.084 --> 44:19.962
Me too!

44:20.921 --> 44:21.993
Well. Kinda.

44:22.088 --> 44:24.798
I mean, I used to do this
show back in Timber Line.

44:24.926 --> 44:25.930
It wasn't a whole circus.

44:26.060 --> 44:27.837
But I juggled and stuff.

44:28.896 --> 44:29.774
You and me.

44:29.897 --> 44:31.868
We are not like other grizzlies.

44:32.066 --> 44:33.775
We are not like.

44:33.902 --> 44:35.941
Anybody else in the world!

44:53.926 --> 44:55.772
That was so inspiring.

44:56.063 --> 44:56.941
So moving.

44:58.065 --> 45:00.002
So. So prof undo.

45:00.134 --> 45:02.913
Let us retire to the caravan.

45:03.005 --> 45:05.010
For our end of the day talk.

45:06.074 --> 45:07.954
We should practice the lift.

45:08.077 --> 45:09.752
I'd like that.

45:10.112 --> 45:11.090
Come.

45:11.915 --> 45:12.850
We will hook.

45:12.983 --> 45:14.829
Over to the trailer.

45:16.921 --> 45:17.856
Time to share.

45:18.055 --> 45:19.832
Like the amigos we are!

45:21.926 --> 45:22.930
I pulled something.

45:24.863 --> 45:26.800
If just once I could perform the dance.

45:27.065 --> 45:28.774
The way it was meant to be.

45:29.102 --> 45:30.948
I would never need to perform it again.

45:31.971 --> 45:32.849
Boogie!

45:33.140 --> 45:35.782
What about the guys chat?

45:36.043 --> 45:37.889
Huh? Yeah.

45:37.978 --> 45:39.858
Ursa and I need to practice.

46:19.128 --> 46:20.006
Doily!

46:20.129 --> 46:22.908
Make sure you get that spot
right by my third...

46:23.033 --> 46:25.743
Ooh! Yeah!

46:25.870 --> 46:26.748
That's it!

46:29.874 --> 46:30.844
Sorry Boogster.

46:30.975 --> 46:32.047
Just a little cramp at my neck.

46:32.144 --> 46:33.022
Seriously?

46:33.145 --> 46:35.787
Six pack, take some pride in your work!

46:35.915 --> 46:37.988
Any chance we can take a little break?

46:38.084 --> 46:40.021
A break? You all just had a break.

46:40.153 --> 46:41.999
Like. Six hours ago.

46:42.089 --> 46:42.990
What is going on here?

46:43.924 --> 46:44.894
Giselle!

46:44.993 --> 46:45.963
Thank goodness! You're back!

46:46.094 --> 46:47.769
Now you can vent him.

46:47.861 --> 46:48.739
Excellent!

46:48.863 --> 46:49.798
Reenforcements.

46:49.964 --> 46:51.866
You two!
Go get me some more berries.

46:51.966 --> 46:54.779
And you! How about you start
massaging my paws?

46:54.904 --> 46:56.977
All this clapping is making me sore.

47:01.111 --> 47:02.089
Now!

47:02.947 --> 47:04.952
- Who are you?
- What are you talking about?

47:05.049 --> 47:06.951
Boog would never yell like that.

47:07.085 --> 47:08.828
Especially at fawns.

47:08.919 --> 47:09.957
So who are you?

47:10.055 --> 47:10.933
Who am I?

47:11.057 --> 47:13.836
- If you haven't noticed, I'm.
- Boog!

47:14.161 --> 47:16.837
I'm so sorry I let you down.

47:16.964 --> 47:20.835
- Can you ever forgive me?
- Does that answer your question?

47:22.972 --> 47:23.850
Giselle!

47:23.972 --> 47:25.783
Oh, thank goodness you're back.

47:26.909 --> 47:27.887
See?

47:27.910 --> 47:29.949
Even the crazy broken deer
knows I'm Boog.

47:30.046 --> 47:31.926
Do you even know his name?

47:32.049 --> 47:33.826
Of course I do.

47:33.917 --> 47:35.763
It's. Uh.

47:35.887 --> 47:37.027
Starts with an E.

47:37.121 --> 47:38.932
E .... Emily?

47:39.057 --> 47:39.935
Edward?

47:40.059 --> 47:41.961
What about 2 L's?

47:42.094 --> 47:43.803
Eleanor? Oh, whatever.

47:43.929 --> 47:45.035
It doesn't matter what his name is.

47:45.130 --> 47:46.839
All that matters.

47:46.932 --> 47:47.902
It's that I'm a grizzly.

47:48.034 --> 47:49.914
And I'm king of the jungle.

47:50.036 --> 47:51.916
First of all, this is a forest.

47:52.005 --> 47:53.043
I tried to tell him.

47:53.174 --> 47:54.781
And second of all.

47:54.876 --> 47:55.846
What have you done with Boog?

47:55.977 --> 47:57.914
- Yeah!
- Where is Boog?

47:58.013 --> 47:58.983
What have you done?

47:59.114 --> 48:00.960
What difference does it make?

48:01.049 --> 48:03.828
You would all do what I say.

48:03.952 --> 48:05.854
I'm your Boog now!

48:05.989 --> 48:06.967
Boog!

48:06.990 --> 48:08.062
Boog, now that we're
best friends again.

48:08.157 --> 48:09.934
What do you say we go on guys trip?

48:10.060 --> 48:11.064
Just the two of us?

48:11.161 --> 48:13.007
He's not Boog!

48:16.967 --> 48:17.945
Oops.

48:19.004 --> 48:20.815
You're not Boog!

48:20.939 --> 48:22.819
That's not Boog!

48:22.942 --> 48:23.912
Oh, thank goodness.

48:24.010 --> 48:24.980
I thought you were mad at me.

48:25.112 --> 48:26.821
But now I know that you weren't.

48:26.915 --> 48:27.816
Because you're not even you!

48:28.149 --> 48:29.027
What a relief.

48:29.150 --> 48:30.825
- Elliot?
- Yes, dear?

48:30.953 --> 48:32.025
- Elliot!
- Oh, right.

48:32.154 --> 48:33.032
What have you done with Boog?

48:33.155 --> 48:35.865
He's locked away somewhere.
You'll never find him!

48:35.958 --> 48:38.031
Especially after tonight,
when they take him back to Russia.

48:39.062 --> 48:39.940
Russia?

48:40.063 --> 48:42.000
- Who's Russia?
- It's not a 'who'!

48:42.132 --> 48:43.010
It's a 'where'.

48:43.134 --> 48:44.035
And believe me.

48:44.135 --> 48:47.073
You could walk for the rest
of your life and never get there.

48:47.171 --> 48:49.915
You won't get away with this!

48:50.042 --> 48:52.821
No? Who's gonna stop me?

48:54.180 --> 48:56.993
Okay! Okay!
Okay, I'm ready to talk.

48:57.150 --> 48:58.791
I'm listening.

48:58.918 --> 48:59.853
He's at the circus.

48:59.987 --> 49:01.958
Just follow the search lights
and you'll find it.

49:02.890 --> 49:03.894
That's a good one.

49:04.024 --> 49:05.096
What search lights?

49:10.966 --> 49:12.846
Now let's go save Boog!

49:12.969 --> 49:14.906
'Cos I owe him a big apology.

49:17.007 --> 49:18.784
And because we miss him

49:18.909 --> 49:20.982
And we want him to come home
before they ship him off to Russia!

49:21.078 --> 49:22.079
Yeah!

49:24.949 --> 49:25.827
Imposter!

49:26.085 --> 49:26.963
Sorry.

49:34.928 --> 49:36.808
That Boog sure is one lucky guy.

49:37.164 --> 49:39.010
I Wish I had a friend like that.

49:41.970 --> 49:42.948
Wait.

49:43.106 --> 49:44.952
I do have a friend like that.

49:45.941 --> 49:48.845
Thank goodness, that nice man
at the Punimart called us.

49:48.978 --> 49:50.050
You poor dear's.

49:50.179 --> 49:53.856
Must have been hungry to go
all that way to find food.

49:53.984 --> 49:54.919
But don't worry.

49:55.019 --> 49:56.899
Mommy won't make that mistake again.

50:01.994 --> 50:03.874
That's enough, isn't it, Bob?

50:03.963 --> 50:06.810
Maybe we should stay.
No, no, you're right.

50:06.932 --> 50:09.005
My snugly, woddly and I
need this time apart.

50:09.102 --> 50:11.915
Kick me out, Bob,
before I change my mind.

50:14.042 --> 50:17.822
Well, we might as well dig in,
since all hope is lost.

50:17.947 --> 50:19.884
Wait for it, wait for it!

50:19.982 --> 50:22.954
Oh, Meat Snack!

50:23.085 --> 50:25.829
Excuse me for a moment.

50:29.994 --> 50:30.929
I hate cats.

50:31.195 --> 50:32.836
So do I.

50:32.930 --> 50:34.832
Fi! Look! The circus!

50:34.967 --> 50:36.073
I've seen of these lights before.

50:38.137 --> 50:39.115
Wait!

50:39.138 --> 50:41.985
You mean the circus
is just behind those trees?

50:42.075 --> 50:44.819
Yes! My new old friend!

50:44.911 --> 50:48.884
Boog is closer than we ever imagined.

51:10.209 --> 51:11.087
Alistair?

51:11.978 --> 51:12.856
What's wrong?

51:12.979 --> 51:13.880
And once again.

51:14.047 --> 51:15.927
I have been tossed away.

51:18.017 --> 51:19.919
Hey, hey, Alistair.

51:20.054 --> 51:20.989
Come on, buddy.

51:21.989 --> 51:23.095
Don't bother me!

51:23.190 --> 51:25.969
I sat in my trailer all night.

51:26.094 --> 51:29.066
Waiting for the sweet sound of paws.

51:29.165 --> 51:30.874
Knocking on my door.

51:30.967 --> 51:31.868
But no.

51:32.000 --> 51:32.901
All I hear.

51:33.002 --> 51:34.040
Is the sounds.

51:34.171 --> 51:35.914
Of loneliness.

51:36.105 --> 51:37.814
What are you talking about?

51:37.942 --> 51:38.912
Have you forgotten?

51:39.043 --> 51:39.921
Already?

51:40.043 --> 51:41.945
Do I mean so little to you?

51:43.114 --> 51:45.085
It's time for guys chat

51:45.216 --> 51:47.096
Just us on guys chat.

51:47.219 --> 51:49.929
You blew off guys chat!

51:50.223 --> 51:51.101
You blew it!

51:52.124 --> 51:53.002
Oh man!

51:53.927 --> 51:54.862
I totally forgot!

51:54.995 --> 51:56.101
See, I was with Ursa and.

51:56.229 --> 51:59.008
Well, you know how it is
when you're all caught up and.

52:01.135 --> 52:02.070
Look, Alistair.

52:03.005 --> 52:04.885
Sometimes it's hard to find
time for everything.

52:04.975 --> 52:06.946
And everyone that's important to you.

52:08.044 --> 52:08.922
Alistair.

52:16.154 --> 52:17.032
Alistair.

52:18.056 --> 52:18.934
You're right.

52:19.192 --> 52:20.901
I've been a bad friend.

52:22.061 --> 52:23.872
You might not believe this, but.

52:25.065 --> 52:27.036
I know exactly how you feel right now.

52:28.101 --> 52:29.036
And I'm sorry.

52:31.071 --> 52:31.949
It's okay.

52:32.941 --> 52:33.819
I forgive you.

52:34.075 --> 52:34.953
Seriously?

52:35.076 --> 52:36.080
That's what friends do!

52:38.113 --> 52:38.991
Amigos!

52:39.982 --> 52:40.860
Don't worry!

52:40.984 --> 52:43.865
We're gonna have plenty of time
for guys chat.

52:43.953 --> 52:44.957
Once we get back to Russia.

52:45.088 --> 52:46.058
Huh? Russia?

52:46.156 --> 52:48.832
Oh, sure!
Oh, you're gonna love it there.

52:48.960 --> 52:50.999
All the snow and the ice.

52:53.064 --> 52:55.103
You're gonna love the way
it pierces your skin.

52:55.200 --> 52:56.078
And makes your...

52:57.102 --> 52:59.846
Oh, I get excited just to think about it.

52:59.938 --> 53:02.011
Plus, it's only 5,000 miles away.

53:02.143 --> 53:03.954
So you can visit home every year or two.

53:04.077 --> 53:04.978
Or three.

53:05.078 --> 53:06.048
Maybe four.

53:07.181 --> 53:08.890
You're gonna be a polar bear.

53:09.016 --> 53:09.894
That's what you're gonna be.

53:10.017 --> 53:11.089
Let's go, troops!

53:11.186 --> 53:12.064
Look alive!

53:13.188 --> 53:15.068
Uncle Boog never took us
on a rescue mission.

53:15.191 --> 53:16.934
Yeah, I know.

53:17.027 --> 53:18.964
This is way cool!

53:19.097 --> 53:21.068
You should go out of town
more often, mother.

53:21.165 --> 53:23.011
Elvis, I don't think so.

53:24.235 --> 53:26.115
Release the emergency break.

53:27.239 --> 53:28.117
We are moving!

53:29.075 --> 53:30.955
Hang on to your little horses.

53:31.143 --> 53:33.080
Steady. Steady.

53:33.213 --> 53:35.115
Alright everyone, steady.

53:35.215 --> 53:37.095
I can't see a thing!

53:39.019 --> 53:41.866
- Why?
- Out of the way! Out of the way!

53:46.195 --> 53:48.132
Steady. Steady.

53:50.033 --> 53:51.105
Oh no! Oh no!

53:51.234 --> 53:53.045
- They're gone! They're gone!
- What's gone?

53:53.170 --> 53:54.845
- Turn left, right?
- Right!

53:54.938 --> 53:56.875
No! Nine! I said left!

54:10.024 --> 54:10.902
No! No!

54:11.225 --> 54:13.136
No!

54:13.994 --> 54:16.099
Oh.

54:18.066 --> 54:19.070
I'm calling it a day.

54:40.026 --> 54:41.064
It's worse than I thought.

54:41.160 --> 54:43.131
They strap him to wheels
and light him on fire.

54:43.263 --> 54:44.141
Then point and laugh!

54:44.231 --> 54:45.940
It's torture at its worst!

54:46.033 --> 54:47.003
We have to rescue Boog before.

54:47.134 --> 54:49.071
They make him wind into tiny,
whiny rope of death!

54:50.037 --> 54:50.915
Let's go!

54:51.138 --> 54:51.946
Yeah!

54:51.974 --> 54:52.145
Wait!

54:53.008 --> 54:54.012
Their fortress is inpenetrable.

54:56.245 --> 54:57.146
it's hard to break into.

54:57.246 --> 54:58.989
So here's what we're gonna do.

54:59.248 --> 55:01.924
McSquizzy and Buddy,
you work on the left flank.

55:02.019 --> 55:04.024
Kids, you run the charging manoeuver
on the right.

55:04.154 --> 55:06.091
Ian, Giselle,
you find a chisel, a toothbrush.

55:06.191 --> 55:07.968
And as many maracas as you can carry.

55:08.091 --> 55:10.164
- Then.
- Or. What about this instead?

55:10.261 --> 55:12.869
Serge and Danny, you find the exits.

55:12.964 --> 55:14.935
Mom and Ian, you stay
and look out here and here.

55:15.067 --> 55:16.844
While the rest of us sneak in here.

55:16.969 --> 55:17.870
And rescue Boog.

55:18.104 --> 55:19.082
Yeah!

55:20.173 --> 55:21.051
That's ridiculous!

55:21.174 --> 55:22.075
The tent's too big.

55:22.176 --> 55:24.022
We need at least 6 more of us.

55:24.145 --> 55:25.023
To pull that off.

55:38.194 --> 55:39.903
Oh, my friends!

55:40.231 --> 55:41.109
Mr. Weenie?

55:41.232 --> 55:42.941
What are you guys doing here?

55:43.035 --> 55:44.937
We are here to safe Boog!

55:45.070 --> 55:47.041
- Kick some pals!
- So are we!

55:47.974 --> 55:49.080
It's destiny.

55:50.109 --> 55:51.113
Ladies and gentlemen!

55:51.211 --> 55:53.057
I'd like to welcome you

55:53.180 --> 55:56.926
To the great Moslova Family Circus!

56:03.157 --> 56:04.866
Everyone clear about what to do?

56:04.994 --> 56:05.964
- Yes!
- No problem.

56:06.062 --> 56:07.134
Uh, what was the middle part again?

56:07.263 --> 56:08.141
Dad ....

56:08.265 --> 56:10.076
Everyone spread out and try to find Boog.

56:10.200 --> 56:11.101
When you see him.

56:11.234 --> 56:14.013
- Go get him.
- Alright, let's move it out.

56:14.105 --> 56:17.077
- Be careful, girls.
- Okay, mom.

56:22.114 --> 56:24.051
So. Come here often?

56:24.149 --> 56:25.050
Don't even think about it.

56:30.992 --> 56:32.030
Stop acting like such a troop.

56:36.097 --> 56:37.101
I really missed you guys.

56:37.198 --> 56:38.873
Yeah, me too.

56:39.001 --> 56:40.175
A full house! This is fantastic!

56:42.004 --> 56:44.976
- Are Ursa and Boog ready to go?
- They're ready.

56:47.077 --> 56:48.055
Boog.

56:48.078 --> 56:48.979
Where did the rest go?

56:51.048 --> 56:54.122
You! You must be the new recruits!

56:54.217 --> 56:55.926
Yeah, yeah.

56:56.022 --> 56:56.957
That's what we are.

57:01.128 --> 57:02.098
Come on, let's go.

57:21.151 --> 57:24.055
- Any sign of Boog?
- No, I can't see him from here.

57:24.188 --> 57:25.158
We need to get to higher ground.

57:25.257 --> 57:26.135
Like that.

57:28.159 --> 57:30.938
Man, I can't wait to get back
and see Alistair.

57:31.162 --> 57:32.166
Back to my own cart.

57:33.032 --> 57:34.934
Home cooking. Three meals a day.

57:36.035 --> 57:38.176
I don't know, Bob.
This expo is a bust.

57:38.272 --> 57:40.118
When we head back to the air stream.

57:42.110 --> 57:43.045
Did you hear that?

57:43.244 --> 57:44.885
He's close by.

57:45.012 --> 57:46.016
I can smell him.

57:48.049 --> 57:49.929
Let me try the bathing call.

57:59.197 --> 58:00.075
Big Foot!

58:21.023 --> 58:22.027
Ladies and gentlemen.

58:22.224 --> 58:25.901
The miraculous balancing...

58:29.266 --> 58:31.112
Stanley! Do you see him?

58:31.201 --> 58:32.978
I'm not seeing him.

58:33.171 --> 58:35.051
Please. Welcome.

58:35.140 --> 58:37.020
The juggling pugs.

58:37.243 --> 58:39.054
Fifi! Do you see him?

58:44.183 --> 58:45.061
Great!

58:46.186 --> 58:47.164
Boog!

58:48.254 --> 58:49.132
Come on.

58:49.257 --> 58:50.966
Let's find a different spot.

58:51.092 --> 58:54.030
You'd think we can't miss
a 1,200 pound fat bear!

58:54.163 --> 58:55.164
Ursa!

58:55.997 --> 58:58.138
- Wait!
- Come on, Boog! Show them what you got.

59:01.136 --> 59:02.174
I can't see a thing from back here.

59:02.305 --> 59:04.014
Any sign of Boog?

59:05.075 --> 59:06.053
Ursa!

59:06.076 --> 59:07.114
You're doing great, Boog.

59:08.112 --> 59:09.150
Oh, you see him? Good!

59:09.280 --> 59:10.158
Let's get him!

59:14.252 --> 59:16.132
Mika! You have returned!

59:18.056 --> 59:19.094
Time to go back into space.

59:19.192 --> 59:20.162
It's dark in here!

59:20.292 --> 59:21.170
Let me out!

59:21.294 --> 59:23.105
I'm coming, Buddy!

59:43.121 --> 59:43.999
Mr. Weenie!

59:44.255 --> 59:47.932
Look, Bob, proof aliens do exist!

59:48.293 --> 59:50.002
- Keep up, handsome.
- Ursa!

59:51.096 --> 59:52.066
Where are you, uncle Boog?

01:00:10.053 --> 01:00:10.931
Hi Fifi!

01:00:11.054 --> 01:00:12.124
Ursa!

01:00:13.256 --> 01:00:15.033
- Pretty!
- Oh no!

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:33.083
I hate dogs.

01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:35.092
Uncle Boog!

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.000
Tell dad he's right there!

01:00:42.057 --> 01:00:43.035
Ursa!

01:00:43.058 --> 01:00:44.062
- Ursa!
- Boog!

01:00:44.194 --> 01:00:45.129
What are you doing?

01:00:45.228 --> 01:00:46.937
You need to get to your place.

01:00:47.063 --> 01:00:48.169
I need to talk to you about Russia.

01:00:48.298 --> 01:00:50.041
It's so far away and.

01:00:50.167 --> 01:00:52.138
- I'm not sure if I...
- Boog, we need to focus here.

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:54.047
It's almost time for the big lift!

01:00:54.172 --> 01:00:56.018
- I know, but...
- Come on, Doug!

01:00:56.108 --> 01:00:57.988
Please don't make this difficult.

01:00:59.044 --> 01:01:00.022
Dad!

01:01:00.045 --> 01:01:01.023
Dad!

01:01:01.147 --> 01:01:02.125
Dad!

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:07.098
Gesalital

01:01:07.221 --> 01:01:09.067
Uncle Boog is right there!

01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:10.160
What are you saying? Right? Left?

01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:11.169
Left? Rig ht? Left?

01:01:12.327 --> 01:01:13.305
Boog!

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:15.008
Elliot!

01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:16.973
Wait, what are you doing here?

01:01:17.065 --> 01:01:18.967
Thank goodness, I found you!

01:01:19.101 --> 01:01:20.139
We're here to rescue you.

01:01:21.237 --> 01:01:23.083
Elliot, I can't go!

01:01:23.173 --> 01:01:24.143
Doug! Pay attention!

01:01:25.175 --> 01:01:26.053
Ready?

01:01:26.177 --> 01:01:27.055
Go, Doug, go!

01:01:27.211 --> 01:01:28.189
Boog!

01:01:28.212 --> 01:01:30.114
It's worse than I thought.

01:01:30.248 --> 01:01:32.025
He's been brain washed.

01:01:32.117 --> 01:01:34.088
And now, Ursa.

01:01:34.219 --> 01:01:36.224
The great bear in disguise.

01:01:36.322 --> 01:01:39.169
Featuring the flying nano plates.

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:57.224
Boog.

01:01:57.247 --> 01:01:59.058
Are you sure you can do this?

01:01:59.183 --> 01:02:00.153
I don't know.

01:02:00.284 --> 01:02:02.130
Russia's a big step and.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.191
No, I mean the lift.

01:02:05.157 --> 01:02:07.094
I've never been able to do it before and...

01:02:07.226 --> 01:02:10.164
if you are not 100 percent
sure you can do it.

01:02:13.099 --> 01:02:13.977
I'll be ready.

01:02:21.343 --> 01:02:22.221
Plan B.

01:02:22.344 --> 01:02:25.123
Smash and grab.
Smash everything and grab Boog.

01:02:28.184 --> 01:02:31.031
Don't bother with me.
Just another circus dancer.

01:02:40.231 --> 01:02:41.109
You ready?

01:02:41.233 --> 01:02:42.168
Come on, Ursa!

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.178
Go for it!

01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:44.180
I got you!

01:02:44.303 --> 01:02:45.281
Boog!

01:02:45.271 --> 01:02:47.151
Okay guys, smash and grab!

01:03:00.156 --> 01:03:01.034
Please hold me.

01:03:13.238 --> 01:03:14.116
He did it!

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:19.021
Oh, she finally did it.

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:21.091
You got me.

01:03:24.084 --> 01:03:25.062
Boog!

01:03:25.085 --> 01:03:26.225
- Uncle Boog!
- You're safe! We're here to save you!

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.097
Rescue accomplished!

01:03:28.189 --> 01:03:29.190
Yes!

01:03:29.224 --> 01:03:30.102
What are you all doing here?

01:03:30.225 --> 01:03:32.230
Come on, let's get moving
before your captors return.

01:03:33.362 --> 01:03:35.037
Hold up, Elliot!

01:03:35.131 --> 01:03:37.102
I appreciate you all trying
to rescue me, but...

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.170
I need to talk to Ursa.

01:03:38.302 --> 01:03:39.280
Ursa?

01:03:39.303 --> 01:03:40.204
Who's Ursa?

01:03:40.337 --> 01:03:41.315
I am.

01:03:46.277 --> 01:03:48.054
So. What?

01:03:48.179 --> 01:03:50.252
She like your new best
friend or something?

01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:52.058
No, I am.

01:03:52.318 --> 01:03:53.296
What?

01:03:57.257 --> 01:03:59.137
You have 2 new best friends?

01:04:00.326 --> 01:04:03.036
I canceled one guys trip
and the next thing I know.

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:04.009
I've been replaced.

01:04:04.265 --> 01:04:05.143
Twice.

01:04:05.266 --> 01:04:07.043
Elliot, buddy.

01:04:07.168 --> 01:04:08.046
I'm sorry.

01:04:09.071 --> 01:04:10.075
You haven't been replaced.

01:04:10.339 --> 01:04:12.116
You'll always be my BFF.

01:04:12.242 --> 01:04:14.144
Are you apologizing?

01:04:14.244 --> 01:04:15.222
Yeah.

01:04:15.246 --> 01:04:17.251
I forgive you.

01:04:18.115 --> 01:04:19.255
But only because you forgave me first.

01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:22.059
Now, let's ditch the goat
and the babe and hit the road!

01:04:23.121 --> 01:04:24.159
I am not a goat!

01:04:25.091 --> 01:04:26.095
I am a Lama.

01:04:26.225 --> 01:04:29.072
Really? 'Cos you look more like an
Argentinian Carnelian.

01:04:32.098 --> 01:04:32.976
And now.

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:34.206
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:04:34.335 --> 01:04:38.115
The musical scaling of Alistair!

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.115
Come on, Boog.

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:46.184
- Without me?
- No.

01:04:46.316 --> 01:04:47.217
We gotta get out of here.

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.127
- Elliot, Alistair.
- Do it!

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:50.153
- Guys..
- Come on.

01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:52.031
Hold on, come on you guys.

01:04:54.325 --> 01:04:56.205
- I'm not letting go:
- Alisa

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.338
Stop!

01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:59.134
Everybody just hold up!

01:05:00.232 --> 01:05:01.210
Ursa.

01:05:01.366 --> 01:05:03.974
My beautiful Russian bear.

01:05:05.171 --> 01:05:07.142
I came here looking
for a place where I belong.

01:05:08.242 --> 01:05:10.088
But what I found was so much more.

01:05:11.112 --> 01:05:11.990
What I found.

01:05:12.346 --> 01:05:13.224
Was you.

01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:16.028
Oh, Boog.

01:05:16.318 --> 01:05:17.253
Come with me.

01:05:18.353 --> 01:05:21.132
Come to the forest, make me the
happiest bear on earth.

01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:25.096
Oh, Boog.

01:05:26.195 --> 01:05:27.165
I really want to.

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:29.978
But I can't.

01:05:32.204 --> 01:05:33.981
A Russian circus without a bear is like...

01:05:34.106 --> 01:05:35.212
no circus at all.

01:05:36.343 --> 01:05:38.086
I could never do that to them.

01:05:39.212 --> 01:05:40.147
You should go.

01:05:41.348 --> 01:05:44.092
I can see that they are more
than just your friends.

01:05:44.318 --> 01:05:46.027
They are your family.

01:05:48.156 --> 01:05:50.036
And family should always stick together.

01:05:50.359 --> 01:05:51.337
Come.

01:05:53.128 --> 01:05:55.008
I will help you move the carts.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.078
Boog.

01:05:58.102 --> 01:05:59.072
You should stay.

01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:01.016
I learn something too!

01:06:01.104 --> 01:06:03.211
That friends want each other to be happy.

01:06:03.307 --> 01:06:05.187
So if she makes you happy.

01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:07.018
Then you should be with her.

01:06:07.145 --> 01:06:08.023
Elliot.

01:06:09.114 --> 01:06:10.084
That was really nice.

01:06:11.084 --> 01:06:12.054
You're awesome, dad.

01:06:12.185 --> 01:06:13.163
Yeah!

01:06:13.185 --> 01:06:14.155
I know.

01:06:19.126 --> 01:06:20.198
These are tears of joy!

01:06:22.262 --> 01:06:24.142
So beautiful!

01:06:24.265 --> 01:06:25.143
Alistair!

01:06:27.336 --> 01:06:29.113
You came back for me?

01:06:29.305 --> 01:06:32.049
Oh, buddy! I'm glad to see you!

01:06:32.142 --> 01:06:34.079
Oh, it's good to see you too!

01:06:34.177 --> 01:06:35.249
I'd like to breathe.

01:06:35.378 --> 01:06:37.155
Sorry, I tricked you, Boog.

01:06:37.248 --> 01:06:40.095
Sometimes you don't know
what you have until you've lost it.

01:06:41.153 --> 01:06:42.225
I know exactly what you mean.

01:06:42.387 --> 01:06:44.198
- Ursa.
- Doug.

01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:46.170
Come on! We're late for our show!

01:06:51.332 --> 01:06:52.210
And now!

01:06:52.333 --> 01:06:54.110
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:06:54.202 --> 01:06:57.015
The duet you've been waiting for.

01:07:02.111 --> 01:07:03.149
Looks like the circus has a bear.

01:07:04.113 --> 01:07:05.185
Looks like you do too.

01:07:07.284 --> 01:07:08.219
What are we waiting for?

01:07:08.352 --> 01:07:09.230
Let's go!

01:07:11.156 --> 01:07:12.091
Let them go.

01:07:12.223 --> 01:07:13.227
But the circus!

01:07:13.324 --> 01:07:14.999
The circus.

01:07:15.093 --> 01:07:16.063
Will be fine.

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:19.268
Or try to work to Rome.

01:07:21.333 --> 01:07:23.213
A place that we call home.

01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:30.079
You sure you're cool with this?

01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:31.145
Absolutely!

01:07:31.245 --> 01:07:33.216
It's important to make time
for your friends.

01:07:33.314 --> 01:07:35.160
Even when you have a babe around.

01:07:35.284 --> 01:07:36.185
Oh yeah!

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:37.220
Punch it in, baby bear.

01:07:43.193 --> 01:07:45.164
Dinkleman, I didn't know
you were a girl!

01:07:46.163 --> 01:07:47.098
Have fun, Elliot!

01:07:47.398 --> 01:07:50.074
And don't forget
to keep an eye on Elvis.

01:07:50.167 --> 01:07:51.273
Let's get move on!

01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:54.044
Guys trip waits for no deer!

01:07:54.173 --> 01:07:55.051
Or bug.

01:07:55.174 --> 01:07:56.178
That's right, son.

01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:59.282
You're old enough to take part
in the sacred tradition that is...

01:07:59.379 --> 01:08:01.156
guys trip.

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:03.993
# On the road again #

01:08:05.287 --> 01:08:08.168
#Just can't wait
to get on the road again #

01:08:09.391 --> 01:08:13.171
# I've always loved making
music with my friends #

01:08:13.296 --> 01:08:16.176
#And I can't wait
to get on the road again #

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:18.178
He's not coming?

01:08:18.368 --> 01:08:20.078
He's gonna join us later.

01:08:22.174 --> 01:08:24.145
Maybe we'll get some answers, Bob.

01:08:24.242 --> 01:08:27.122
Like if Mr. Weenie was probed or not.

01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:30.193
# On the road again #

01:08:31.384 --> 01:08:34.127
# Going places that I've never been #

01:08:36.157 --> 01:08:39.037
# Seeing things
that I may never see again #

01:08:39.161 --> 01:08:42.133
#I can't wait
to get on the road again #

01:08:45.367 --> 01:08:46.245
Hey Alistair.

01:08:47.136 --> 01:08:48.242
Aren't you glad
to be going back to Russia?

01:08:48.371 --> 01:08:50.251
Oh, truth said it, amigo.

01:08:51.274 --> 01:08:53.154
I hope I get to see my girlfriend.

01:08:54.278 --> 01:08:56.020
Carmen I'm coming for you!

01:08:57.113 --> 01:08:58.118
# On the road again #

01:08:58.349 --> 01:09:02.095
# Like a band of gypsies
we go down the highway #

01:09:03.154 --> 01:09:05.055
#With the best friends #

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:08.264
# it's now the world keeps
turning our way #

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:11.139
#In Norway#

01:09:12.233 --> 01:09:13.237
What is it?

01:09:13.368 --> 01:09:17.307
It's just a little something
we set up for you.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:19.243
This is so sweet.

01:09:19.341 --> 01:09:22.051
Thank you for making me feel welcome.

01:09:24.214 --> 01:09:25.286
Alright, ladies. Look alive!

01:09:27.283 --> 01:09:28.219
Oh, brother.

01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:34.099
Oh, arrest me, officer.

01:09:34.192 --> 01:09:36.231
- Got it.
- Shake it, shake it.

01:09:36.361 --> 01:09:39.071
To the right. Two three four.

01:09:42.336 --> 01:09:45.240
Who's up for the rabbit fight!

01:09:51.212 --> 01:09:52.191
Yeah.

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:30.193
Look out, baby.

01:10:42.241 --> 01:10:43.211
Guys trip!

01:10:49.415 --> 01:10:52.057
It doesn't getting any better than this.

01:10:52.219 --> 01:10:54.099
Just me and my best friend in the world,

01:10:54.254 --> 01:10:56.293

- You got it, Boog.

01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:58.292
BFF till the end.
