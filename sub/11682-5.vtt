00:00.318 --> 00:01.818
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.428 --> 00:06.795
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.621 --> 00:09.902
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.903 --> 00:12.537
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.539 --> 00:14.906
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.908 --> 00:16.641
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.643 --> 00:19.711
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.713 --> 00:22.914
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.916 --> 00:24.182
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.184 --> 00:25.851
Should we shoot them?

00:25.853 --> 00:28.720
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.722 --> 00:31.089
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.091 --> 00:33.525
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.527 --> 00:35.727
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.729 --> 00:40.165
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:44.937 --> 00:48.206
<i>Mysterious trips</i>
<i>around the world with Max.</i>

00:48.208 --> 00:49.841
I mean, he's, what,
your keeper or whatever?

00:49.843 --> 00:52.310
He's my agency contact.

00:54.447 --> 00:55.781
You've been putting up
some W's lately.

00:55.783 --> 00:57.149
The right people are starting
to take notice.

00:57.151 --> 01:00.418
Michael Westen, soon-to-be
reinstated agent of the CIA.

01:00.420 --> 01:01.686
How does that sound?

01:01.688 --> 01:03.789
That sounds great, Max.
Thanks for everything.

01:06.459 --> 01:07.559
Max!

01:09.196 --> 01:11.196
Stay with me.
Stay with me, Max.

01:11.198 --> 01:12.230
Max.

01:16.036 --> 01:19.204
Fi, someone shot Max,
the police are on the way,

01:19.206 --> 01:20.839
and I think I'm holding
the murder weapon.

01:20.841 --> 01:22.507
I covered my tracks...

01:25.211 --> 01:26.778
...So I covered the tracks
of the killer.

01:26.780 --> 01:28.413
Michael, we have to do something
about that gun.

01:28.415 --> 01:30.549
And we need to get an alibi
for you, like, right now.

01:31.818 --> 01:32.918
Let's go to work.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.523
<i>As a spy,</i>

01:38.525 --> 01:40.725
<i>you're in the information</i>
<i>business --</i>

01:40.727 --> 01:42.761
<i>stealing it, protecting it,</i>

01:42.763 --> 01:45.163
<i>and, if you have to,</i>
<i>destroying it.</i>

01:45.165 --> 01:46.731
<i>Some secrets are so dangerous</i>

01:46.733 --> 01:49.367
<i>that you can't allow them</i>
<i>to continue to exist.</i>

01:49.369 --> 01:51.503
<i>A murder weapon</i>
<i>that implicates you</i>

01:51.505 --> 01:53.471
<i>in a crime you didn't commit,</i>
<i>for example,</i>

01:53.473 --> 01:55.640
<i>is a secret best kept</i>

01:55.642 --> 01:58.410
<i>with 4,000 degrees</i>
<i>of burning thermite.</i>

01:58.412 --> 02:00.111
Hey. Got here
as soon as I could.

02:00.113 --> 02:01.713
How'd it go?
Okay.

02:01.715 --> 02:03.215
I put together
some credit-card receipts

02:03.217 --> 02:05.483
putting everyone in Key West
yesterday on a little vacation.

02:05.485 --> 02:07.485
Key West?
Hey.

02:07.487 --> 02:09.354
You want an alibi on such short notice,
you don't get to be picky.

02:11.725 --> 02:12.891
You guys
are melting down a gun.

02:12.893 --> 02:14.092
I don't have
much choice.

02:14.094 --> 02:15.994
Whoever did this knew exactly
what they were doing.

02:15.996 --> 02:18.830
They managed to put a murder weapon
in Michael's hands and get away clean.

02:18.832 --> 02:20.866
I just want to put this out there.
If we go to the cops now --

02:20.868 --> 02:23.301
No. It's not gonna fly.
I talked to the cops.

02:23.303 --> 02:24.736
The CIA has taken over
the scene.

02:24.738 --> 02:26.471
They got a case officer
down here now.

02:26.473 --> 02:28.173
And she wants me in
for a chat.

02:28.175 --> 02:30.041
Oh. Great. Perfect.

02:30.043 --> 02:31.710
And you have no idea
who killed Max?

02:31.712 --> 02:33.311
None. Could be an enemy
of Max's

02:33.313 --> 02:35.180
who wants a burned spy
for a fall guy

02:35.182 --> 02:37.182
or an enemy of mine looking
to keep me out of the game.

02:37.184 --> 02:38.717
What about the people
who burned you?

02:38.719 --> 02:40.752
You said you had doubts
about that investigation.

02:40.754 --> 02:43.021
Anything's possible, but I'm not
gonna be able to find out

02:43.023 --> 02:44.789
if I'm in jail
for first-degree murder.

02:44.791 --> 02:46.524
- We have to get rid of the gun.
- Are you sure about this?

02:46.526 --> 02:48.960
Once you start a cover-up,
there's no going back.

02:48.962 --> 02:50.829
It's already started.
I trashed the key logs

02:50.831 --> 02:52.731
at the murder scene
and wiped the place down.

02:52.733 --> 02:54.532
The only thing
that's gonna save me

02:54.534 --> 02:55.800
is finding
the real killer.

02:55.802 --> 02:57.202
This train's rolling,
brother.

02:57.204 --> 02:59.104
The only question
is whether you get on board.

02:59.106 --> 03:01.806
Hell yeah.
I'm on board. Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:32.606 --> 03:34.472
You must be
Michael Westen.

03:34.474 --> 03:36.308
I'm Agent Pearce.
Thanks for coming.

03:36.310 --> 03:38.944
No place I'd rather be.

03:38.946 --> 03:40.078
Max was...

03:40.080 --> 03:41.346
A friend? I know.

03:41.348 --> 03:42.814
I'd, uh, offer
my condolences,

03:42.816 --> 03:46.017
but I'm much better at catching
bad guys than shedding tears.

03:46.019 --> 03:47.619
We'll find
whoever did this.

03:49.989 --> 03:51.256
What can I do?

03:51.258 --> 03:52.958
Let me walk you
through the scene.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.259
You be the killer.

03:54.261 --> 03:56.861
We found two bullets
out in the hallway,

03:56.863 --> 04:01.433
so if you're the killer,
you fire on Max out there, miss,

04:01.435 --> 04:03.001
then chase him in here.

04:03.003 --> 04:06.838
Blood spatter
says Max was...

04:06.840 --> 04:08.640
Where I'm standing.

04:08.642 --> 04:10.976
You bust in,
put two shots in his back.

04:10.978 --> 04:13.044
He bleeds out here.

04:13.046 --> 04:15.447
Now Max is dead.
What do you do?

04:15.449 --> 04:16.680
Run to the exit.

04:16.683 --> 04:19.317
I think you head
for the key log.

04:19.319 --> 04:21.519
So, you rip the hard drive
out of the wall.

04:21.521 --> 04:23.955
Now there's no record
of your entry.

04:23.957 --> 04:26.591
But how do you
get out clean?

04:26.593 --> 04:27.959
Elevator.

04:27.961 --> 04:30.428
No trace. Try again.

04:30.430 --> 04:33.765
I hope you're not asking me
to jump.

04:33.767 --> 04:36.901
Oh, you're the killer
in this little exercise.

04:36.903 --> 04:38.503
Is that how you escaped?

04:38.505 --> 04:40.038
Not unless I could fly.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.141
We found rope fibers, and I got
friction marks right here.

04:43.143 --> 04:46.011
The killer rappelled down.
Probably had help.

04:46.013 --> 04:47.345
How are your
climbing skills?

04:47.347 --> 04:50.215
Not bad. Why?

04:50.217 --> 04:51.716
Am I a suspect?

04:51.718 --> 04:52.984
To be honest,

04:52.986 --> 04:55.186
when I heard a burned spy
was mixed up with Max,

04:55.188 --> 04:58.156
my first instinct was to fit you
for a head bag.

04:58.158 --> 04:59.491
I appreciate
your restraint.

04:59.493 --> 05:00.992
Well, you <i>did</i> show up today.

05:00.994 --> 05:03.028
And as your new
agency contact,

05:03.030 --> 05:06.131
a head bag wouldn't have started
us off on the right foot.

05:06.133 --> 05:07.599
You're Max's replacement?

05:07.601 --> 05:09.167
We worked on some operations
together.

05:09.169 --> 05:11.536
I have some
investigations experience.

05:13.005 --> 05:15.273
I asked
for this assignment.

05:15.275 --> 05:17.242
Max was one
of the good guys.

05:17.244 --> 05:20.111
I want to find out who did this
just as much as you do.

05:20.113 --> 05:22.313
I'd love to have you
on the team.

05:22.315 --> 05:24.182
You should know this
about me, though --

05:24.184 --> 05:26.618
I've got a pit bull at home,

05:26.620 --> 05:29.120
and I learned how to run
an investigation from her.

05:29.122 --> 05:32.123
She sinks her teeth in,
she doesn't let go.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.892
Ever.

05:35.061 --> 05:36.661
She sounds like a nice dog.

05:36.663 --> 05:37.595
She can be.

05:40.132 --> 05:43.968
But she is a very,
very determined bitch

05:43.970 --> 05:46.104
when she wants something.

05:46.106 --> 05:48.540
I need to know
I can count on you.

05:48.542 --> 05:49.841
I'm your man.

05:49.843 --> 05:52.510
I was hoping you'd say that,
Michael.

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

06:10.755 --> 06:13.690
I don't get it.
You're joining the CIA manhunt?

06:13.867 --> 06:14.831
Did you forget

06:14.832 --> 06:16.798
that search could end up
at <i>your</i> doorstep, Michael?

06:16.800 --> 06:18.967
If I'm one of the hunters,
maybe I can avoid that.

06:18.969 --> 06:20.869
Plus, looking
over Pearce's shoulder

06:20.871 --> 06:23.371
gives me a bird's-eye view
of the entire investigation.

06:23.373 --> 06:24.706
We should be working
our own angle

06:24.708 --> 06:26.041
to find out who killed Max.

06:26.043 --> 06:28.043
Pearce is already checking
the cellphone activity

06:28.045 --> 06:30.245
from the day
of Max's murder.

06:30.247 --> 06:31.713
Why can't I just cheat
off her notes?

06:31.715 --> 06:33.615
- You think the killer made a call?
- Maybe.

06:33.617 --> 06:35.817
I've never seen the police
respond that fast.

06:35.819 --> 06:37.419
At least I can make sure

06:37.421 --> 06:40.122
that they don't track
the phone call I made to you.

06:40.124 --> 06:42.724
So, check the phone records.

06:42.726 --> 06:45.227
But if Pearce starts
poking around,

06:45.229 --> 06:48.597
don't forget there are
no conjugal visits in CIA jail.

06:52.068 --> 06:53.735
Is that who you're supposed to
be meeting here?

06:53.737 --> 06:55.337
- Yeah.
- Bad time for a client. Who is he?

06:55.339 --> 06:58.140
He was with the Special Forces
in Afghanistan.

06:58.142 --> 07:00.075
My C.O. tracked me down,
asked for a favor.

07:00.077 --> 07:01.810
And you're --

07:01.812 --> 07:04.146
Not telling the captain who
pulled me out of a burning jeep

07:04.148 --> 07:06.281
that "I don't really have
the time right now."

07:06.283 --> 07:08.617
Michael.
Lieutenant Ethan Reed.

07:08.619 --> 07:09.518
Mrs. Westen.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.555
Why don't you grab a seat,
Lieutenant?

07:13.557 --> 07:15.123
So, what can I do
for you?

07:15.125 --> 07:17.459
Captain Novak didn't tell me,
really, what this was about

07:17.461 --> 07:19.227
other than we have a lot
in common.

07:19.229 --> 07:21.963
Well, the CIA recruiters on base
were hounding me pretty bad

07:21.965 --> 07:24.166
until I made it clear
I wasn't interested.

07:24.168 --> 07:25.967
Or maybe it's that I beat
your sharpshooting record

07:25.969 --> 07:27.969
at Camp Rhino --

07:27.971 --> 07:30.071
94% from 600 meters.

07:30.073 --> 07:32.908
Ninety --

07:32.910 --> 07:34.576
so, you're here
to pick up the trophy?

07:34.578 --> 07:37.746
No, no. I, um...

07:37.748 --> 07:40.215
Is there somewhere we can talk
that's more private?

07:40.217 --> 07:43.018
Let's take a walk.

07:43.020 --> 07:45.120
So, I got back
from my tour in Afghanistan

07:45.122 --> 07:46.955
a couple of months ago,
and I found out

07:46.957 --> 07:48.757
that my sister was dating
this guy, Brandon,

07:48.759 --> 07:52.194
a-and I knew he was a scumbag,
but he seemed harmless.

07:52.196 --> 07:54.229
What happened?

07:54.231 --> 07:56.064
He, uh, he nearly beat her
to death.

07:56.066 --> 07:58.099
He put her
in intensive care.

07:58.101 --> 08:00.068
I'm sorry, Ethan.
Have the cops done anything?

08:00.070 --> 08:01.837
They'd arrest him
if he fell in their lap,

08:01.839 --> 08:03.738
but they're not looking for him
very hard.

08:03.740 --> 08:05.607
I thought you could help me
track him down

08:05.609 --> 08:07.843
using some
of your resources.

08:07.845 --> 08:09.544
Right up my alley.
Fi.

08:09.546 --> 08:12.514
You end up finding Brandon.
What next?

08:12.516 --> 08:15.050
After what he did
to Heather...

08:15.052 --> 08:17.686
I think Ethan's already picked
flowers for Brandon's funeral.

08:17.688 --> 08:19.955
You're not thinking this
through. She's your sister.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.023
It won't take long
for the cops to figure out

08:22.025 --> 08:23.658
you're the number-one suspect.

08:23.660 --> 08:26.194
So, that's it? You're saying
you're not gonna help?

08:26.196 --> 08:27.395
No. If you want <i>my</i> help,

08:27.397 --> 08:29.698
Brandon goes to jail,
not to the morgue.

08:29.700 --> 08:31.900
Fine. But I'm coming along
every step of the way.

08:31.902 --> 08:33.735
When we catch him,
I want to be there.

08:33.736 --> 08:35.736
At the very least,
I owe this guy a broken nose.

08:38.174 --> 08:39.908
- I can live with that.
- Go to your meeting.

08:39.909 --> 08:42.210
I'll call Sam and see if we can
lure Brandon out of hiding.

08:42.212 --> 08:43.510
Thanks, Fi.

08:57.894 --> 08:59.327
Mrs. Depaolo?

08:59.329 --> 09:01.696
We don't mean to bother you,
but is your son, Brandon, here?

09:01.698 --> 09:04.966
Sorry.
He moved out years ago.

09:04.968 --> 09:07.068
Oh, uh, could you tell us
where to find him?

09:07.070 --> 09:09.504
Because Brandon's got himself
a brand-new laptop,

09:09.506 --> 09:12.641
hell, maybe even an iPad,
if this check ever finds him.

09:12.643 --> 09:15.110
- I don't know where he is.
- Ah.

09:15.112 --> 09:16.878
And why is he getting
a check?

09:16.880 --> 09:18.146
It's a legal matter.

09:18.148 --> 09:19.714
Your son had some
auto-body work done

09:19.716 --> 09:21.683
at a shop in Brickell
a couple years back.

09:21.685 --> 09:23.952
Well, the owner of the shop just
lost a class-action lawsuit.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.487
He was overcharging
his customers.

09:25.489 --> 09:27.956
Brandon was a customer,
so Brandon gets a check.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.725
I mean, two g's may not seem
like much, but --

09:30.727 --> 09:33.795
$2,000?
I know it's an inconvenience,

09:33.797 --> 09:35.463
but maybe
you could take the check

09:35.465 --> 09:37.432
and hand it off to Brandon
next time you see him?

09:37.434 --> 09:39.668
I -- I could do that.

09:39.670 --> 09:42.070
Great.
Thank you very much.

09:46.742 --> 09:48.276
So, she took the check.
Now what?

09:48.278 --> 09:50.245
Well, now Cathy
takes the money to Brandon,

09:50.247 --> 09:51.579
or he shows up here.

09:51.581 --> 09:53.248
Almost always works,
but it's not fast.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.884
Why don't you go home?
We'll take the first shift.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.218
No.
No, I'm on every shift.

10:00.791 --> 10:02.624
Lucky us.

10:02.762 --> 10:05.429
<i>Whether you're operating</i>
<i>out of a war room in Langley</i>

10:05.431 --> 10:08.132
<i>or commandeering a hotel</i>
<i>in South Beach,</i>

10:08.134 --> 10:11.102
<i>all CIA investigations</i>
<i>work the same.</i>

10:11.104 --> 10:13.003
<i>Because analysts are tied</i>

10:13.005 --> 10:15.673
<i>directly into federal</i>
<i>and local databases,</i>

10:15.675 --> 10:17.775
<i>they have information</i>
<i>at their fingertips.</i>

10:17.777 --> 10:19.977
<i>What they don't have</i>
<i>is a magic button</i>

10:19.979 --> 10:22.146
<i>that tells them</i>
<i>what is a real lead</i>

10:22.148 --> 10:23.614
<i>and what is a dead end.</i>

10:23.616 --> 10:27.384
<i>That takes boots on the ground,</i>
<i>eyeballs on the screens,</i>

10:27.386 --> 10:29.153
<i>and lots and lots of coffee.</i>

10:29.155 --> 10:31.856
What, the CIA can't afford
filing cabinets?

10:31.858 --> 10:33.624
Oh. I don't think
I'll be getting much sleep

10:33.626 --> 10:35.126
until we find
Max's killer.

10:35.128 --> 10:36.861
So, where are we?
What are we doing?

10:36.863 --> 10:38.696
We'd like to revisit your
final operation with Max.

10:38.698 --> 10:40.598
I read the file -- some sort
of corporate espionage

10:40.600 --> 10:42.399
the French
were involved with?

10:42.401 --> 10:43.567
Dead end.
Got out clean.

10:43.569 --> 10:45.102
The operation
before that, then.

10:45.104 --> 10:47.338
I'm telling you, that's not
where you want to look.

10:47.340 --> 10:50.107
We were doing small-scale
field operations,

10:50.109 --> 10:51.642
nothing that would get
anyone killed.

10:51.644 --> 10:53.477
If you are trashing my leads,

10:53.479 --> 10:55.045
you better have something
to suggest.

10:55.047 --> 10:58.983
How about cellphone activity
around Max's office?

10:58.985 --> 11:00.451
The FBI's
gonna run them down.

11:00.453 --> 11:01.886
FBI?
That's three weeks of red tape.

11:01.888 --> 11:03.320
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

11:03.322 --> 11:05.489
These investigations take time,
Michael. You know that.

11:07.325 --> 11:09.293
Someone who's not "official"

11:09.295 --> 11:12.596
could work a lot faster
than the FBI.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.099
If that were the case,

11:15.101 --> 11:17.101
I wouldn't want
to know details,

11:17.103 --> 11:19.170
because if that person
got caught digging...

11:19.172 --> 11:21.672
They'd be on their own.

11:23.708 --> 11:25.676
It was nice
not seeing you today.

11:35.420 --> 11:36.687
What's with
the "Yellow Pages"?

11:36.689 --> 11:38.656
Just a little
pleasure reading.

11:41.092 --> 11:43.694
This is taking forever.
Brandon's not gonna show.

11:43.696 --> 11:45.829
He'll show.
Just be patient.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.831
In Afghanistan, things were
a lot simpler, you know?

11:47.833 --> 11:51.402
You get your orders, you get
your bullets, take your shot.

11:51.404 --> 11:53.103
Who do you think
gets the intel

11:53.105 --> 11:55.673
to tell you where to point
your rifle and take that shot?

11:55.675 --> 11:58.876
A spy
sitting in a car all day.

11:58.878 --> 12:01.111
At least we got yogurt.

12:01.113 --> 12:04.181
Hold on.
We have a guest.

12:04.183 --> 12:06.150
Yep, that's Brandon,
all right.

12:06.152 --> 12:07.418
That son of a bitch.

12:07.420 --> 12:08.652
Hold on. Hold on.
We talked about this.

12:08.654 --> 12:10.321
We'll grab him
on the way out.

12:10.323 --> 12:11.922
<i>Whether you're kidnapping</i>
<i>a ruthless dictator</i>

12:11.924 --> 12:13.557
<i>in a foreign country</i>

12:13.559 --> 12:15.626
<i>or snatching an abusive</i>
<i>boyfriend off the street,</i>

12:15.628 --> 12:17.861
<i>it's best</i>
<i>not to leave a mess behind.</i>

12:17.863 --> 12:20.864
<i>Using your target's own car</i>
<i>as a getaway vehicle</i>

12:20.866 --> 12:23.601
<i>keeps neighbors from asking</i>
<i>about the missing owner.</i>

12:23.603 --> 12:25.669
<i>Plus, you don't have to pay</i>
<i>for gas.</i>

12:28.139 --> 12:29.373
Don't worry.
We're not gonna hurt you.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.175
We're just gonna ask you
some questions.

12:31.177 --> 12:32.643
You think you could beat on my
sister and get away with it?

12:32.645 --> 12:33.544
Ethan!

12:33.546 --> 12:34.612
I didn't -- I d--

12:34.614 --> 12:35.980
Ethan!

12:35.982 --> 12:37.181
He didn't give a beating.
He took one.

12:37.183 --> 12:38.582
What does that mean?

12:38.584 --> 12:40.017
It means there's more to this
than what we know.

12:40.019 --> 12:41.018
Look at his face.

12:41.020 --> 12:43.687
Stand down. Stand down.

12:43.689 --> 12:44.888
You're all right.
You're all right.

12:44.890 --> 12:47.057
We're just gonna go
for a little ride.

12:47.059 --> 12:48.492
Gonna sort this out.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.564
Really?

12:57.269 --> 13:00.104
I didn't touch your sister, man.
I would never hurt Heather.

13:00.106 --> 13:01.205
Then tell us who did.

13:01.207 --> 13:02.640
It's my boss,
Brad Ramsey.

13:02.642 --> 13:05.943
He runs a medical-insurance scam
in Homestead.

13:05.945 --> 13:08.846
He'd give me money
to pay off medical clerks.

13:08.848 --> 13:10.481
I wanted to do something nice
for Heather,

13:10.483 --> 13:13.150
so I skimmed some of the cash to
take her away for the weekend.

13:13.152 --> 13:14.551
And Ramsey found out.

13:14.553 --> 13:16.754
Heather fought back.
I tried to help.

13:16.756 --> 13:20.090
You left her bleeding
in the driveway of a hospital

13:20.092 --> 13:21.325
like a stray dog.

13:21.327 --> 13:22.693
What was I supposed to do?

13:22.695 --> 13:23.961
You were supposed to
protect her!

13:23.963 --> 13:24.995
And what about you,
big bro?

13:24.997 --> 13:26.830
Heather tried calling you
for help,

13:26.832 --> 13:29.700
but you were too busy playing
Captain America in Afghanistan.

13:31.403 --> 13:32.703
Hey. Interrogation 101 --

13:32.705 --> 13:35.439
you lose your head,
they stop talking.

13:35.441 --> 13:37.174
You can skip the spy school.
This bastard is the reason

13:37.176 --> 13:38.642
Heather's breathing
through a tube right now.

13:38.644 --> 13:41.779
Breaking his jaw
is not gonna get him to talk.

13:41.781 --> 13:44.481
Go on. Cool off.
Go outside.

13:44.483 --> 13:47.818
Okay. Upsy-Daisy.

13:47.820 --> 13:50.020
Stop crying.
You're all right.

13:50.022 --> 13:52.890
Now,
if you don't cooperate,

13:52.892 --> 13:55.693
I'm gonna let Ethan come back
in here and talk to you.

13:55.695 --> 13:56.927
Alone.

13:56.929 --> 13:59.063
Do you understand?

13:59.065 --> 14:02.533
All right. Tell me everything
you know about Brad Ramsey.

14:05.543 --> 14:07.978
<i>People tend to think</i>
<i>spies are motivated</i>

14:07.980 --> 14:10.681
<i>by love of the game,</i>
<i>desire for adventure,</i>

14:10.683 --> 14:12.249
<i>or patriotic fervor.</i>

14:12.251 --> 14:14.017
<i>The truth, though,</i>
<i>is that you don't choose</i>

14:14.019 --> 14:15.652
<i>a life as a covert operative</i>

14:15.654 --> 14:18.388
<i>unless something deeper is</i>
<i>going on beneath the surface,</i>

14:18.390 --> 14:19.857
<i>something more personal,</i>

14:19.859 --> 14:21.725
<i>something harder to explain,</i>

14:21.727 --> 14:23.894
<i>and something</i>
<i>a lot more painful.</i>

14:23.896 --> 14:25.095
I should have been there.

14:25.097 --> 14:26.930
It wasn't your fault.

14:26.932 --> 14:28.932
She was so beautiful.

14:30.168 --> 14:32.636
Now look at her.

14:34.839 --> 14:36.740
If you want to get the guy
who put her in here...

14:38.243 --> 14:40.511
...I know how to do it.

14:43.815 --> 14:46.016
So, that's the guy
who beat my sister?

14:46.018 --> 14:47.451
That's him.

14:47.453 --> 14:50.387
Ramsey runs the scam
Brandon was wrapped up with.

14:52.824 --> 14:54.892
The other chucklehead
is Joel Davenport.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.226
He steals Medicare numbers
so Ramsey

14:56.251 --> 14:58.122
can use them to
bilk the insurance companies.

15:00.498 --> 15:02.065
These guys are ruining
a lot of lives.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.634
This clinic
used to help people,

15:03.636 --> 15:06.637
but now it's basically just a
private ATM for these scumbags.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.772
So the guy's even more
of a bastard than we thought?

15:08.774 --> 15:10.340
Same plan as before, right?

15:10.342 --> 15:13.010
Dragging Ramsey to the police
isn't an option now.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.511
The cops were your idea,
remember?

15:14.513 --> 15:16.647
Well, your sister basically
helped rip off a scam artist.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.215
Man, I'm just saying

15:18.217 --> 15:19.783
the cops are not gonna make it
a priority.

15:19.785 --> 15:22.452
We grab him now, Ramsey spends
a few hours behind bars.

15:22.454 --> 15:24.421
He'll be out
in time for happy hour.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.454
Now, on the other hand, if we
can get him

15:25.479 --> 15:27.029
to show us the
details of his little business,

15:27.293 --> 15:29.626
he'll rot in jail
until you're old and gray.

15:29.628 --> 15:30.604
We're just gonna
politely ask him

15:30.629 --> 15:32.229
if we can see his scam?
You think that'll work?

15:32.264 --> 15:33.864
No, I'll have to
approach Ramsey

15:33.866 --> 15:35.866
as the kind of guy
he'd want to talk to.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.568
No. <i>I'm</i> approaching Ramsey.
Was I unclear

15:37.570 --> 15:39.436
when I said I'm coming along
every step of the way?

15:39.438 --> 15:41.038
Ethan, you're not trained
for this.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.606
Then train me.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.741
When this is over,
I want him to know it was me.

15:44.743 --> 15:45.943
I owe that to Heather.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.845
All right, kid. Fine.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.413
You're gonna
need a suit.

16:04.829 --> 16:06.830
Excuse me. We're looking
for Brad Ramsey.

16:08.433 --> 16:09.566
Well, you found him.

16:09.568 --> 16:11.301
We don't mean
to spoil the party,

16:11.303 --> 16:13.770
but we'd like a few minutes of
your time, talk a little business.

16:13.772 --> 16:14.905
Yeah, well,
I'm pretty sure

16:14.907 --> 16:16.573
that you guys
aren't on the guest list.

16:16.575 --> 16:17.875
Just give us two minutes
of your time --

16:17.877 --> 16:20.744
no interruptions,
no intrusions --

16:20.746 --> 16:23.046
and I promise you,
next year at this time,

16:23.048 --> 16:24.915
your vacation home in Rio
will make this place

16:24.917 --> 16:26.583
look like a dollhouse.

16:28.953 --> 16:30.053
Let's talk over here.

16:31.389 --> 16:33.390
What kind of business
you guys in?

16:33.392 --> 16:34.625
Same as you.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.126
Only on a much bigger scale.

16:36.128 --> 16:37.961
We can't go into much detail
right now,

16:37.963 --> 16:39.897
but our network is pulling in
some serious cash.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.365
We'd like to bring you in.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.734
I only work
for one man -- me.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.469
I'm doing just fine
on my own.

16:45.471 --> 16:46.536
That's why we want you.

16:46.538 --> 16:48.105
But why settle
for "just fine"

16:48.107 --> 16:49.806
when you could be
doing "great"?

16:49.808 --> 16:51.375
You got to think bigger.

16:51.377 --> 16:54.077
I mean, sure, your kiddy pool
with a "view" is fine.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.412
But the pool

16:55.414 --> 16:57.681
at our place on Star Island --
now, that's great.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.516
Come to our party.
Check it out.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.418
Who knows -- maybe you'll like
what we have to offer.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.720
No offense -- I mean, I'm sure
you guys are doing great,

17:03.722 --> 17:04.922
but, uh, I got things
under control.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.490
We're talking
the big time here, Ramsey.

17:06.492 --> 17:07.824
You want to be bush league
forever?

17:07.826 --> 17:10.093
Bush league?
Who are you calling bush league?

17:10.095 --> 17:12.829
Uh, you'll have to forgive
my young, enthusiastic friend.

17:12.830 --> 17:14.865
When we found him,
he was scraping by

17:14.867 --> 17:17.000
on 6 grand a week
in a timeshare scam,

17:17.002 --> 17:18.702
so we had to drag him
out of the gutter.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.704
Sometimes his passion
gets ahead of his manners.

17:23.141 --> 17:24.473
Here's our info.

17:24.476 --> 17:26.609
In case you change your mind
about...

17:26.612 --> 17:28.578
Moving up in the world?

17:32.250 --> 17:34.918
I have to get back
to my guests.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.387
Feel free to stick around.
Have a beer.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.958
And then get the hell
off my property.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.693
I just blew it.
You did fine.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.429
Did you clock his face
when I said "6 grand a week"?

17:45.431 --> 17:46.563
We'll be seeing him again.

17:51.235 --> 17:52.836
Hey, man.

17:52.838 --> 17:55.172
Whoa.

17:55.174 --> 17:56.707
What...

17:56.709 --> 17:59.876
I'm sorry.
Am I in the...wrong...

17:59.878 --> 18:02.512
This is Michael Westen's place,
right?

18:02.514 --> 18:04.081
Look, I knew Fi was gonna
shake things up

18:04.083 --> 18:06.717
a little bit in here,
but come on, now, man.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.552
You got a breadbasket.
Are you cool with all this?

18:08.554 --> 18:09.987
Yeah, you know,
it's, um...

18:11.456 --> 18:13.156
...A process.
Right.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.725
Do you have an update
on those phone records?

18:14.727 --> 18:15.959
Yes.

18:15.961 --> 18:18.195
But before I do,
I just want to point out,

18:18.197 --> 18:20.530
even if you can dodge
this frame-up thing,

18:20.532 --> 18:22.599
you and I could get
into a <i>lot</i> of trouble for this.

18:22.601 --> 18:23.867
I owe you, Jesse.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.369
No, I mean, like,
this is in violation

18:25.371 --> 18:26.737
of an executive order

18:26.739 --> 18:29.306
and a pretty big
constitutional amendment.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.675
I <i>really</i> owe you?
Yeah. You do.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.143
Okay.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.811
All these red dots
represent cellphone calls

18:34.813 --> 18:36.146
made around Max's building.

18:36.148 --> 18:37.814
Now, if we eliminate
all the calls

18:37.816 --> 18:41.318
made a half-hour before
or after Max's death,

18:41.320 --> 18:43.120
anything with,
uh, family plans,

18:43.122 --> 18:44.788
anything easily traceable,

18:44.790 --> 18:47.190
we are left with...

18:47.192 --> 18:48.592
One call.

18:48.594 --> 18:51.161
Made from a burner cell
to a pay phone. Boom.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.630
The killer was probably
signaling that the job was done.

18:53.632 --> 18:54.898
- It's a dead end.
- Oh, no.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.434
No, you will not rain
on my cellphone-magic parade,

18:57.436 --> 18:59.503
because I tracked the burner
to the bodega that sold it.

18:59.505 --> 19:02.372
I'm gonna go grab the security tapes
and find out who bought it.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.474
I <i>really, really owe you, Jesse.</i>

19:04.476 --> 19:06.777
Yes, you do.
Sam, what's going on?

19:06.779 --> 19:08.111
Ramsey just called.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.180
Said he can't wait
to go to our party.

19:10.182 --> 19:11.782
You would've been proud, Mikey.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.216
Watching Ethan work a cover

19:13.218 --> 19:15.185
was like seeing a baby
take his first steps,

19:15.187 --> 19:16.787
only, you know,
less adorable.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.488
Did your new lady friend
get us a car?

19:18.490 --> 19:19.823
Ha, you call it a car.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.324
I call it a work of art.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.559
What about the house?

19:22.561 --> 19:25.228
Are we ready to introduce Ramsey
to a new life?

19:25.230 --> 19:27.030
Yeah, yeah. We're all set.
But listen, Mike.

19:27.032 --> 19:28.498
Just so we're clear,
nothing happens

19:28.500 --> 19:31.501
to big mama's wheels
or the mansion.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.036
'Cause once
you've laid your head

19:33.038 --> 19:34.504
on 2,000-thread-count sheets,

19:34.506 --> 19:38.442
you never want to go back
to the couch.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.677
Ohh, yeah.

19:42.146 --> 19:44.748
Is that potpourri
that I'm smelling?

19:46.417 --> 19:47.717
You're killing me, man.

19:54.459 --> 19:56.927
<i>Jealousy is a delicate emotion.</i>

19:56.929 --> 19:58.728
<i>Show someone</i>
<i>what they can't have,</i>

19:58.730 --> 20:00.263
<i>and they'll just resent you.</i>

20:00.265 --> 20:03.633
<i>Give it to them too easy,</i>
<i>and they won't appreciate it.</i>

20:03.635 --> 20:06.736
<i>They key is allowing them</i>
<i>just enough of a taste</i>

20:06.738 --> 20:08.638
<i>so all they want is more.</i>

20:08.640 --> 20:09.973
Ah.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.641
Our guest of honor.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.264
I still can't believe I'm
supposed to drink with the guy.

20:13.265 --> 20:14.307
Just think of it this way --

20:14.332 --> 20:16.015
every time the
bastard cracks a smile,

20:16.048 --> 20:18.415
he's tightening the noose
around his own neck.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.517
Hey!
Look who's here!

20:20.519 --> 20:21.651
It's about time.

20:21.653 --> 20:22.573
Better late than never.

20:22.574 --> 20:24.138
Think our friend here
needs a drink, yeah?

20:24.163 --> 20:25.350
Yeah.

20:25.351 --> 20:27.518
So I said, "Shoot the dog."
And so I did.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.193
Oh, sorry, ladies.

20:30.195 --> 20:31.628
- Come on, now.
- Don't worry.

20:31.630 --> 20:32.863
We'll get to them later.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.164
There's somebody
I want you to meet.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.966
Fast Eddie,
Brad Ramsey.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.401
The infamous Brad Ramsey.
Bring it in here.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.370
I've been called worse.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.472
- Yeah, I'll bet you have, man.
- Hey, sit down, guys.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.274
Please, please.

20:44.276 --> 20:46.076
So, Eddie here...

20:46.078 --> 20:48.512
Is the wizard
behind our global network.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.947
He sets up
fake medical facilities

20:50.949 --> 20:52.482
that spit out real money.
It's easy, really.

20:52.484 --> 20:55.218
A lot of places around the world,
healthcare is 10% of the GDP.

20:55.220 --> 20:57.487
It's so big, no one even notices
when we take a little...

20:57.489 --> 20:59.723
slice for ourselves,
isn't that right?

20:59.725 --> 21:00.978
That's just fancy talk for

21:01.003 --> 21:02.787
"We have a very
good thing going."

21:03.128 --> 21:04.861
Oh, look, I'm a little low.

21:04.863 --> 21:07.030
Why don't you fill him in?
I'll be right back.

21:07.032 --> 21:09.132
It seems like you guys
got it all figured out.

21:09.134 --> 21:10.400
What do you need me for?

21:10.402 --> 21:12.869
Oh. One can never have
too many friends.

21:12.871 --> 21:16.339
South Florida is a --
is a Medicare gold mine, okay?

21:16.341 --> 21:18.508
Our only problem is,
we're not hooked up down here.

21:18.510 --> 21:20.677
You <i>are.</i> So we want to see
your whole network.

21:20.679 --> 21:23.113
Then we combine your ideas
with our capital,

21:23.115 --> 21:24.314
everybody gets rich.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.016
What, are you crazy?

21:26.018 --> 21:27.951
It took me seven years
to set up my business.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.786
You think I'm just gonna
hand it over?

21:29.788 --> 21:32.556
No, w-we're not asking you to hand
over anything, Ramsey. This is a merger.

21:32.558 --> 21:35.325
We get to see the details
behind your operation,

21:35.327 --> 21:38.428
the mind that created it,
and then you get all this.

21:38.430 --> 21:41.198
Oh. There's the boss.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.200
He blew off Pebble Beach
to meet you.

21:43.202 --> 21:44.067
Shall we?

21:44.069 --> 21:45.835
Come on, man.

21:56.914 --> 21:58.682
Beautiful.

22:00.585 --> 22:01.751
- Eduardo.
- Boss.

22:05.556 --> 22:07.357
You must be Ramsey.
Welcome aboard.

22:07.359 --> 22:10.126
Not so fast. I ain't signed
any dotted lines just yet.

22:10.128 --> 22:12.395
Did I hop on my G6
for a "Maybe"?

22:12.397 --> 22:15.465
What can I say? The best
don't come easy. I'm sorry.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.934
"I'm sorry"? "I'm sorry"
doesn't get me back on the links

22:17.936 --> 22:19.569
in time for the back nine,
does it?

22:19.571 --> 22:20.804
What's the holdup?

22:20.806 --> 22:21.771
It's not his fault.

22:21.773 --> 22:24.107
This seems
too good to be true.

22:24.109 --> 22:26.543
Then your guys start asking
details about my business.

22:26.545 --> 22:28.345
I mean, how do I know
you're not cops?

22:28.347 --> 22:30.780
Fair question.

22:30.782 --> 22:32.282
Deserves
an honest answer.

22:37.488 --> 22:40.957
Cops write tickets.

22:40.959 --> 22:44.394
Cops eat doughnuts.

22:44.396 --> 22:45.996
They don't do <i>this.</i>

22:47.431 --> 22:49.799
Son of a bitch!

22:49.801 --> 22:51.301
Careful.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.536
I learned jujitsu on the sands
of Okinawa.

22:53.538 --> 22:56.206
That's -- that's my car!
No, that's not your car.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.741
<i>That's</i> your car.

22:57.743 --> 23:00.076
I call it
the thinking car.

23:00.078 --> 23:01.811
Take your time.
Have a ball.

23:20.832 --> 23:22.568
- "Thinking car"?
- Felt right at the time.

23:22.569 --> 23:23.836
It felt -- I don't give
a damn how it felt.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.061
I better see
my car again, Mike.

23:25.337 --> 23:26.803
I know the
feeling, buddy.

23:29.435 --> 23:31.535
So, when are we finished
with the car-giving phase.

23:31.561 --> 23:33.128
I'd love to get
to the ass-kicking phase.

23:33.130 --> 23:35.731
Seducing Ramsey with our scam
is a process, Ethan.

23:35.733 --> 23:37.299
He's inches away
from giving us

23:37.301 --> 23:39.034
everything we need
to take him down.

23:39.036 --> 23:41.270
Now, the more info we can
ask him for about the scam,

23:41.272 --> 23:42.871
the more he's got to talk
to his guys.

23:42.873 --> 23:44.506
We drop a bug
in those conversations,

23:44.508 --> 23:46.275
the cops are gonna have
some easy listening.

23:46.277 --> 23:48.277
So, what, I have to
hang with him some more?

23:48.279 --> 23:50.379
As soon as we get everything
we need from the bug,

23:50.381 --> 23:51.847
you can break off
your friendship,

23:51.849 --> 23:53.415
but you have to be --

23:53.417 --> 23:54.583
patient.
I-I know. I know.

23:54.585 --> 23:56.051
So, how do we get
the bug on him?

23:56.053 --> 23:58.720
Well, Ramsey was damn near
drooling over my watch, Mike.

23:58.722 --> 24:00.456
Great.
Let's give him another gift.

24:01.558 --> 24:03.392
Mike...

24:03.394 --> 24:06.261
What happened to the bench,
the one with the work toys?

24:06.263 --> 24:10.098
Fiona thought that she didn't
want to mix work with...

24:10.100 --> 24:11.867
It's in the back now.

24:11.869 --> 24:13.969
<i>When bugging a watch,</i>
<i>it's better</i>

24:13.971 --> 24:17.372
<i>to use a good-looking knock-off</i>
<i>than its authentic counterpart,</i>

24:17.374 --> 24:19.541
<i>and not just because</i>
<i>it's easier on your wallet.</i>

24:19.543 --> 24:21.443
<i>The insides of a fake timepiece</i>

24:21.445 --> 24:23.178
<i>are usually smaller</i>
<i>and simpler,</i>

24:23.180 --> 24:25.681
<i>leaving more room</i>
<i>for hiding a listening device.</i>

24:25.683 --> 24:28.484
<i>As long as your target</i>
<i>isn't a watch connoisseur,</i>

24:28.486 --> 24:30.853
<i>zinc alloy and cubic zirconia</i>

24:30.855 --> 24:33.956
<i>are a great way</i>
<i>of saying "Let's be friends."</i>

24:37.360 --> 24:40.562
Ramsey, my man.
Here you go.

24:42.899 --> 24:44.833
Boss was glad you finally
came to your senses.

24:44.835 --> 24:46.301
I was glad, too.

24:46.303 --> 24:48.904
Yeah, I'll be glad when I start
to see some serious green.

24:48.906 --> 24:51.173
Eager.
Yeah, I like -- I like that.

24:51.175 --> 24:52.708
It reminds me of me.

24:52.710 --> 24:54.476
Once you give the boss
the details on your operation,

24:54.478 --> 24:55.878
we'll bring you up to speed
on our system,

24:55.880 --> 24:57.679
and from there,
smooth sailing.

24:57.681 --> 25:00.349
Hey. Look at this.

25:00.351 --> 25:02.518
I got you
a little welcome gift.

25:02.520 --> 25:03.752
Well, now.

25:03.754 --> 25:05.754
I think that'll look
just great on me.

25:05.756 --> 25:08.590
I got one just like it.
I call it the lucky watch.

25:08.592 --> 25:10.959
If I were you, I'd never
take that thing off.

25:10.961 --> 25:13.562
Think I can do that.

25:13.564 --> 25:16.498
All right. Come on. Come on.
The guys are waiting for you.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.934
A thousand bucks you hit
nothing but water.

25:18.936 --> 25:20.168
We'll see about that.
Pull!

25:21.405 --> 25:24.239
Double or nothing?

25:24.241 --> 25:26.909
Hey.
Look who I found.

25:26.911 --> 25:28.243
Ramsey.

25:28.245 --> 25:30.779
If you're here,
then you're done thinking.

25:30.781 --> 25:32.881
- That car can be pretty convincing.
- Good.

25:32.883 --> 25:35.584
Now that you're coming on board,
let's iron out the details.

25:35.586 --> 25:37.819
We need to get an understanding of
how you move your money around.

25:37.821 --> 25:39.257
Way ahead of you. This
is the Medicare

25:39.282 --> 25:40.847
fee schedule
from my last scam.

25:44.661 --> 25:46.695
You came all the way here
to waste our time?

25:46.697 --> 25:49.498
This could have been written
on a cocktail napkin!

25:49.500 --> 25:51.600
Oh!

25:51.602 --> 25:55.504
What we're looking for
is, well, everything.

25:55.506 --> 25:58.473
All your doctor names,
all your patient numbers,

25:58.475 --> 26:00.509
every little detail
of your enterprise.

26:00.511 --> 26:03.412
You give us that,
then we can move forward.

26:03.414 --> 26:05.213
Every little detail
of your enterprise.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.448
Triple or nothing?

26:06.450 --> 26:09.051
I'll talk to my guys,
put something together.

26:09.053 --> 26:10.686
You do that.

26:10.688 --> 26:12.988
And just so you know,
I'm keeping the Porsche.

26:12.990 --> 26:15.857
If you tried to give it back,
I'd worry about you.

26:21.097 --> 26:22.831
Yeah, uh, Mike,
since Jesse's helping you

26:22.833 --> 26:24.066
with your little CIA problem,

26:24.068 --> 26:25.901
you might want to get
his car back for him.

26:25.903 --> 26:27.703
One problem
at a time, Sam.

26:30.541 --> 26:34.376
<i>In certain neighborhoods,</i>
<i>posing as a dirty cop</i>

26:34.378 --> 26:36.745
<i>is a great way</i>
<i>to confiscate information.</i>

26:36.747 --> 26:39.147
<i>It gives you the authority</i>
<i>that comes with a badge</i>

26:39.149 --> 26:42.951
<i>and invokes the fear that</i>
<i>comes with being a criminal.</i>

26:42.953 --> 26:46.121
Hello, there.
I'm Officer Stone.

26:46.123 --> 26:48.857
We have ourselves
a little situation.

26:48.859 --> 26:51.126
Last week, Officer Goodtimes
over there came in here

26:51.128 --> 26:53.428
and bought a jug of vodka
with his pay-by-the-hour friend.

26:53.430 --> 26:54.896
Stressful job, Sharon.

26:54.898 --> 26:56.531
Guy's got to blow off a little
steam every now and again.

26:56.533 --> 26:57.833
This guy knows
what I'm talking about.

26:57.835 --> 27:01.069
The thoroughly
embarrassing evidence

27:01.071 --> 27:02.671
is all over
your surveillance tapes,

27:02.673 --> 27:04.006
and we're gonna
need them.

27:05.675 --> 27:06.808
Yeah.

27:06.810 --> 27:08.543
Those tapes
are pretty expensive.

27:08.545 --> 27:10.812
I suppose I could part with them
for, oh...

27:10.814 --> 27:12.080
500 bucks?

27:12.082 --> 27:14.216
You know what,
it might be easier

27:14.218 --> 27:15.517
to throw your sorry ass
in jail

27:15.519 --> 27:17.219
for those bootleg DVDs
you got back there.

27:17.221 --> 27:20.455
And selling booze
to minors.

27:23.559 --> 27:26.428
Wow. Got a real
state-of-the-art operation

27:26.430 --> 27:28.697
going on here, don't you?

27:28.699 --> 27:29.998
It's everything
from last month.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.200
We're gonna need
some popcorn.

27:32.202 --> 27:34.870
Got a better idea.
Throw in a carton of smokes.

27:34.872 --> 27:37.973
Hmm. Mm-hmm.
Hmm? Yeah.

27:37.975 --> 27:41.043
And I'm watching
all of these why?

27:41.045 --> 27:42.944
A friend of mine,
he was murdered.

27:42.946 --> 27:45.213
The killer might be
on one of these tapes.

27:45.215 --> 27:46.648
Mm.

27:46.650 --> 27:48.784
What am I looking for
exactly?

27:48.786 --> 27:51.687
Whenever you see someone
buy a cellphone,

27:51.689 --> 27:53.989
mark the date and time.

27:53.991 --> 27:55.290
Well, it's your lucky day,

27:55.292 --> 27:57.492
'cause I'm boycotting
my favorite soap this week.

27:57.494 --> 27:58.860
Oh?

27:58.862 --> 28:00.062
Dr. Wesley
broke off his engagement,

28:00.064 --> 28:01.430
and he moved to Alaska!

28:01.432 --> 28:02.597
That's too bad.

28:02.599 --> 28:04.466
Yeah.

28:04.468 --> 28:07.035
How's it going with --
what's his name?

28:07.037 --> 28:08.170
Ethan?

28:08.172 --> 28:09.705
He's holding his own.

28:09.707 --> 28:12.240
<i>Joel, Joel.</i>

28:12.242 --> 28:13.975
<i>Just give me the paperwork</i>
<i>for the doctors' I.D.s.</i>

28:13.977 --> 28:15.444
<i>How am I supposed to</i>
<i>trust you?</i>

28:15.446 --> 28:16.945
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>are you talking about?</i>

28:16.947 --> 28:18.980
<i>I'm</i> in charge of this.
Your judgment's off lately!

28:18.982 --> 28:20.348
Those guys who gave you
the Porsche --

28:20.350 --> 28:21.750
you don't
even know them!

28:21.752 --> 28:24.052
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- We'll make it work.

28:24.054 --> 28:25.520
I talked to the other guys,

28:25.522 --> 28:27.556
and they all agree with me --
you're a liability.

28:27.558 --> 28:29.324
First, you put that girl
in the hospital.

28:29.326 --> 28:30.759
If she recovers --

28:30.761 --> 28:32.761
if that bitch recovers,
I'm gonna finish her off!

28:32.763 --> 28:33.749
No big deal!

28:33.774 --> 28:34.731
What -- what are you doing?
Let go of me.

28:34.732 --> 28:37.466
Joel, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

28:37.468 --> 28:39.565
He's talking
about killing my sister.

28:39.590 --> 28:40.236
You all right?

28:40.237 --> 28:41.870
<i>I got no problem</i>
<i>putting you</i>

28:41.872 --> 28:43.705
<i>or any of the other guys</i>
<i>in the hospital.</i>

28:43.707 --> 28:47.576
Yeah. I, uh, I just need
to get some air.

28:47.578 --> 28:49.945
<i>This is my business,</i>
<i>not yours.</i>

28:49.947 --> 28:51.780
<i>I make the decisions.</i>

28:51.782 --> 28:54.649
You're not even supposed to
be back here.

28:54.651 --> 28:56.985
We'll talk later.

28:56.987 --> 28:59.321
<i>O-okay, fine.</i>
<i>Okay, fine. I got it.</i>

28:59.323 --> 29:02.057
What do you want to bet he's
going after Ramsey at the clinic?

29:02.059 --> 29:03.825
Then we better
get there first.

29:11.802 --> 29:13.135
Where the hell is he?

29:13.137 --> 29:14.469
Oh, Ethan's a sniper.

29:14.471 --> 29:16.071
He's not taking a shot
from here.

29:16.073 --> 29:18.206
He'd try to find a perch.

29:19.575 --> 29:21.877
Right there. 9:00.

29:21.879 --> 29:24.179
Man, that kid set up fast.

29:29.552 --> 29:31.553
He wouldn't fire on Ramsey
in a crowd, would he?

29:31.555 --> 29:33.321
No. He's like Michael.

29:33.323 --> 29:34.589
He'll wait
for a clear shot.

29:34.591 --> 29:37.159
All right. Let's go.
I'll talk him down.

29:37.161 --> 29:39.394
It's too late.
We need a distraction.

29:39.396 --> 29:41.196
<i>Protecting a target</i>
<i>from a bullet</i>

29:41.198 --> 29:43.965
<i>sometimes means taking</i>
<i>a few shots at them yourself.</i>

29:43.967 --> 29:46.134
<i>A near miss</i>
<i>puts the target on their guard</i>

29:46.136 --> 29:47.702
<i>and keeps the real gunman</i>
<i>at bay.</i>

29:49.405 --> 29:51.873
Fi. Fi, not my car!
Relax.

29:51.875 --> 29:53.408
I'll just put one
through the windshield.

29:53.410 --> 29:55.977
<i>But you can never predict</i>
<i>how someone is going to react</i>

29:55.979 --> 29:57.445
<i>to a bullet</i>
<i>whizzing by their head.</i>

29:59.549 --> 30:01.082
What the hell, man?!

30:13.729 --> 30:15.130
Just the windshield, Fi?

30:20.283 --> 30:21.883
- He was...
- He never got a shot off.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.534
Fi fired first
and scared Ramsey away,

30:23.536 --> 30:25.035
which is not to say it's a victimless
crime because my car --

30:25.037 --> 30:27.204
What the hell
were you thinking?

30:27.206 --> 30:28.706
You want to know
what I was thinking?

30:28.708 --> 30:31.008
I was thinking as long as
I corrected for a slight breeze

30:31.010 --> 30:32.976
and pulled the trigger
on my exhale,

30:32.978 --> 30:34.978
the guy who put my sister
in the hospital

30:34.980 --> 30:36.447
wasn't going to
exist anymore.

30:36.449 --> 30:37.981
We had a deal.
We had a plan.

30:37.983 --> 30:39.616
Yeah, and your plan
wasn't working!

30:39.618 --> 30:41.418
It wasn't working as fast
as <i>you</i> wanted it to.

30:41.420 --> 30:43.087
Big difference.

30:43.089 --> 30:44.682
You got a way to bring the
son of a bitch down

30:44.707 --> 30:45.890
before I retire?
I'm all ears.

30:45.891 --> 30:48.225
We needed Ramsey
talking to his crew.

30:48.227 --> 30:49.660
Now he thinks someone's
trying to kill him.

30:49.662 --> 30:50.928
He's not gonna talk
to his crew.

30:50.930 --> 30:52.596
He's not gonna talk
to anyone. He's gonna --

30:52.598 --> 30:53.931
Three voicemails
in the last hour.

30:53.933 --> 30:55.632
Ramsey can't stop
calling me.

30:57.936 --> 30:59.236
Oh, come on.
That's a little funny.

30:59.238 --> 31:01.472
Dude's reaching out
to the guy that, um,

31:01.474 --> 31:03.374
tried to kill him.
I'm sorry.

31:04.610 --> 31:06.176
Ethan,
we can still use this.

31:06.178 --> 31:08.946
Things are already tense
in Ramsey's crew.

31:08.948 --> 31:11.448
- You call him. You tell him --
- No, no, no, no, no!

31:11.450 --> 31:14.551
I'm <i>done</i> pretending
to be this bastard's friend!

31:21.526 --> 31:24.061
All right, so, uh, well,
it sounds like you want

31:24.063 --> 31:26.330
to turn Ramsey on his own crew,
pin the shooting on them?

31:26.332 --> 31:29.032
But the only person who can run
point just walked out the door.

31:29.034 --> 31:30.501
And?

31:30.503 --> 31:32.002
He is not an option.

31:32.004 --> 31:33.704
Unless <i>you</i> want
to be in the room

31:33.706 --> 31:35.539
standing between Ethan
and Ramsey.

31:39.010 --> 31:41.545
Familiar scene out there.

31:43.348 --> 31:45.315
You remember when you came home
on leave that first time?

31:45.317 --> 31:48.352
You spent hours out there
the day that you found out

31:48.354 --> 31:52.222
that Patrick Garney
had stolen your girlfriend.

31:52.224 --> 31:54.124
And then you stole
his motorcycle

31:54.126 --> 31:56.059
and drove it
into the Miami River.

31:56.061 --> 31:58.395
Mom, I think
this is a little different.

31:58.397 --> 32:00.497
If you say so.

32:00.499 --> 32:02.266
How many years of training
did it take

32:02.268 --> 32:06.069
before you learned
to curb <i>your</i> anger, Michael?

32:06.071 --> 32:10.107
The man you are today
is not the boy who left home.

32:10.109 --> 32:12.676
You were a scared kid
when you left.

32:12.678 --> 32:15.779
You were angry at the world.
You were angry at everything.

32:15.781 --> 32:17.781
I've seen
loved ones get hurt.

32:17.783 --> 32:20.651
I've never plotted to kill
anyone in cold blood.

32:20.653 --> 32:22.052
No.

32:22.054 --> 32:24.087
Your mother raised you
better than that.

32:26.257 --> 32:29.259
Someone has to teach <i>him,</i>
<i>Michael.</i>

32:30.428 --> 32:32.496
You can save it.

32:32.498 --> 32:34.364
You want Ramsey dead,

32:34.366 --> 32:36.300
and you don't think
I have anything to say

32:36.302 --> 32:37.434
worth listening to.

32:37.436 --> 32:39.436
Well, I understand
that feeling.

32:39.438 --> 32:41.138
So, uh...

32:41.140 --> 32:44.475
Do you want to compare
body counts?

32:44.477 --> 32:46.276
All right. If it's gonna
be that kind of talk.

32:46.278 --> 32:47.878
Actually, it's not.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.514
I'm telling you I know more
about this than you do.

32:51.583 --> 32:54.017
You're not in a war zone
anymore, Ethan.

32:54.019 --> 32:55.986
So you're saying you think
I'll regret killing the guy

32:55.988 --> 32:57.187
'cause this isn't
a battlefield?

32:57.189 --> 32:58.989
Listen to me. I won't.

32:58.991 --> 33:01.592
I want to finish this
my way.

33:01.594 --> 33:03.961
You don't get to do
what you want to do.

33:03.963 --> 33:06.897
You lost that right the moment
your sister got beaten.

33:06.899 --> 33:08.298
What's that
supposed to mean?

33:08.300 --> 33:11.768
Your life
doesn't belong to you.

33:11.770 --> 33:13.504
Your decisions
affect other people.

33:13.506 --> 33:15.439
You need to start thinking
about Heather.

33:15.441 --> 33:17.307
That <i>is</i> what I'm doing.

33:17.309 --> 33:20.210
You can't help her
from jail.

33:23.681 --> 33:26.416
You know who acts
out of selfish anger?

33:26.418 --> 33:28.986
The Ramseys of this world.

33:30.889 --> 33:33.924
And that's their weakness.

33:33.926 --> 33:37.361
And that's what you use
to destroy them.

33:39.330 --> 33:41.832
What do I do?

33:41.834 --> 33:44.535
You look Ramsey in the eye
one last time.

33:44.537 --> 33:46.169
You go to bat for him.

33:46.171 --> 33:49.339
You convince him
you are his best friend.

33:49.341 --> 33:53.977
And when he's ready to burn
his whole life to cinders...

33:53.979 --> 33:56.613
You hand him the match.

34:01.153 --> 34:03.353
Ramsey! Ramsey!

34:03.355 --> 34:05.622
Come on.

34:05.624 --> 34:07.324
Ramsey, what the hell's going on?
Come on. Come on. Come on.

34:07.326 --> 34:08.525
Come on.

34:08.527 --> 34:10.594
Come on! Come on.

34:10.596 --> 34:14.031
Someone shot at me
coming out of the clinic.

34:14.033 --> 34:16.900
I hope to God
you're kidding.

34:16.902 --> 34:18.467
Someone's shooting at him.

34:18.469 --> 34:20.404
We're through here.
Thanks for playing. Next.

34:20.406 --> 34:22.873
Whoa, hold on. Hold on.
Every problem's got a solution.

34:22.875 --> 34:24.841
Does anyone have a reason
to shoot at you?

34:24.842 --> 34:25.754
Do you have any problems?

34:25.779 --> 34:27.079
I mean, do any of your
people know about our deal?

34:27.146 --> 34:30.013
My guys? Oh, they would --
they would never.

34:30.014 --> 34:31.915
All right. Well, wait.
There was -- there --

34:31.917 --> 34:33.449
there was one --
there was one guy

34:33.452 --> 34:35.217
that was pissed
that I was talking to you.

34:35.219 --> 34:37.387
Every time
we work with amateurs,

34:37.389 --> 34:39.089
the minute money's on the table,
people start shooting.

34:39.091 --> 34:40.958
Okay, but it's his <i>people.</i>
<i>It's not him.</i>

34:40.960 --> 34:42.525
So give the guy a break.

34:42.527 --> 34:44.527
You can take care of this
the way you did for me.

34:44.530 --> 34:46.563
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.
What are you talking about?

34:46.565 --> 34:49.433
He means turn your crew over
to the cops. Are you slow?

34:49.435 --> 34:51.101
That's how we got rid
of the kid's baggage

34:51.103 --> 34:52.402
when he started
working for me.

34:52.404 --> 34:53.837
Turn the cops
on my crew?

34:53.839 --> 34:56.239
If they're shooting at you,
they're not your crew anymore.

34:56.241 --> 34:58.742
If you're working with us,
we got to tie up loose ends.

34:58.744 --> 35:00.277
I can't --
Ramsey!

35:00.279 --> 35:02.379
This is
the moment, all right?

35:02.381 --> 35:03.647
If you want
to work with us,

35:03.649 --> 35:05.949
this deal could pull in
$50 mil a year.

35:05.951 --> 35:07.751
That's 10% for you.
That's your cut.

35:10.088 --> 35:11.822
$5 million?

35:11.824 --> 35:13.156
Yeah, but you don't get
any of that

35:13.158 --> 35:16.393
unless you can take care
of your problems here.

35:16.395 --> 35:18.962
What's it gonna be?

35:18.964 --> 35:20.497
Kid, let's go.
All right, wait.

35:20.499 --> 35:22.766
Wait, wait, wait.
All right.

35:22.768 --> 35:24.935
I can do this, okay?

35:24.937 --> 35:26.536
Yes.

35:26.538 --> 35:28.171
Change your shirt.
You look like a hick.

35:28.173 --> 35:30.407
Call our guys.
Let's get this done.

35:36.547 --> 35:38.015
This is everything I got.

35:38.017 --> 35:39.916
You sure none of this
is gonna point back at me?

35:39.918 --> 35:41.284
Not that it matters.

35:41.286 --> 35:43.153
You'll be on the beach
in the Caymans.

35:43.155 --> 35:46.156
Maybe you'd like
a little company.

35:46.158 --> 35:47.457
All right.

35:47.459 --> 35:49.393
Love to stay for the fun part,
but we got to jet.

35:56.468 --> 35:57.768
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:57.770 --> 35:59.703
What's this for?
It's for the house.

35:59.705 --> 36:01.872
We're making sure nothing
connects any of this to you.

36:03.107 --> 36:05.008
You want me to burn
my own house down?

36:05.010 --> 36:06.877
Uh, yeah. Come on, Ramsey.
Be serious.

36:06.879 --> 36:09.079
How many parties have you had
in this place?

36:09.081 --> 36:10.947
Your crew has fingerprints
everywhere,

36:10.949 --> 36:12.749
hair, DNA,
all kinds of crap.

36:12.751 --> 36:14.668
Believe me. We're gonna
set you up with a new

36:14.693 --> 36:15.893
place to call home.

36:21.926 --> 36:24.194
<i>For a spy,</i>

36:24.196 --> 36:27.464
<i>revenge is a dish</i>
<i>that is rarely served at all.</i>

36:27.466 --> 36:29.366
<i>The mission objective</i>
<i>always takes priority</i>

36:29.368 --> 36:30.901
<i>over personal satisfaction.</i>

36:30.903 --> 36:32.169
Care to do the honors?

36:32.171 --> 36:34.371
<i>But if conning a scam artist</i>

36:34.373 --> 36:36.940
<i>into burning everything he's</i>
<i>worked his whole life to build</i>

36:36.942 --> 36:38.308
<i>serves that mission,</i>

36:38.310 --> 36:40.510
<i>it's hard not to take</i>
<i>a little joy</i>

36:40.512 --> 36:43.113
<i>in watching it all</i>
<i>go up in flames.</i>

36:59.564 --> 37:01.364
Come on, man.
Don't sweat it.

37:01.366 --> 37:02.999
The boss has got the jet
fueled and ready.

37:03.001 --> 37:05.802
Blink,
and we'll be in Monaco.

37:23.888 --> 37:25.555
I take it
everything went well.

37:25.557 --> 37:27.824
Like a dream.
Great.

37:27.826 --> 37:30.494
I'll tell the pilot
we're ready to take off.

37:30.496 --> 37:33.130
If you have any other loose ends...

37:33.132 --> 37:34.431
...Now's the time
to speak up.

37:35.767 --> 37:37.267
Nope. No loose ends.

37:37.269 --> 37:38.835
Wait, what was that? You --
what, you think of something?

37:38.837 --> 37:40.437
No, man, it's nothing.
It's -- it's all good.

37:40.439 --> 37:41.772
Look, if you're holding
something back

37:41.774 --> 37:43.173
and the boss finds out
about it later,

37:43.175 --> 37:44.508
he's gonna drop your body
off that jet.

37:45.676 --> 37:47.410
There <i>is</i> something.

37:48.546 --> 37:50.013
It's just this bitch.

37:50.015 --> 37:51.915
Okay? I beat her down.
I-I put her in the hospital.

37:51.917 --> 37:54.151
Is there a problem?

37:54.153 --> 37:55.385
No, we're fine.

37:55.387 --> 37:59.189
We're just working out
one last little...kink.

37:59.191 --> 38:01.691
Some bitch
in a hospital bed?

38:02.760 --> 38:04.261
Then you need
to take care of it.

38:04.263 --> 38:05.962
What do you mean,
take care of it?

38:05.964 --> 38:07.727
Little poison in the I.V.,
and she'll sleep forever.

38:07.752 --> 38:08.800
Kill her?

38:08.801 --> 38:10.000
Listen,
you can wrap this up

38:10.002 --> 38:11.334
or you can hang here
with your boys,

38:11.336 --> 38:13.036
wait till they rat you out,
and let the cops drag you.

38:13.038 --> 38:14.070
It's your choice.

38:14.072 --> 38:17.040
Clock's ticking.

38:22.480 --> 38:24.080
Okay. I-I'll do it.

38:24.082 --> 38:25.816
I'll put the bitch
out of her misery.

38:33.658 --> 38:36.226
<i>A soldier on the battlefield</i>
<i>would never dream</i>

38:36.228 --> 38:38.195
<i>of intentionally putting</i>
<i>a dangerous weapon</i>

38:38.197 --> 38:40.030
<i>in the hands of an enemy.</i>

38:40.032 --> 38:43.366
<i>But as a spy, sometimes</i>
<i>the only way to solve a problem</i>

38:43.368 --> 38:46.870
<i>is trusting a bad guy</i>
<i>to do what comes naturally.</i>

38:56.881 --> 38:58.548
<i>And if you help with the plan,</i>

38:58.550 --> 39:00.984
<i>you know exactly</i>
<i>how to make them fail.</i>

39:00.986 --> 39:03.119
Drop it! Put the needle down!
What, man?

39:03.121 --> 39:04.287
Get off of me!
Get him out of here!

39:04.289 --> 39:06.022
Get off of me, man!
I was set up!

39:06.024 --> 39:07.290
I was set up!

39:07.292 --> 39:09.292
You got him? Great.

39:09.294 --> 39:11.928
I would have felt so guilty if
something bad would have happened.

39:11.930 --> 39:13.964
No, uh, I'd rather not
give my name.

39:13.966 --> 39:17.067
I don't even know the guy. I'm
just a citizen doing my duty.

39:18.369 --> 39:21.171
Hey, hey!
That's the guy!

39:21.173 --> 39:22.472
That's the guy
who set me up!

39:22.474 --> 39:24.941
That's the guy!

39:29.648 --> 39:30.947
It's open.

39:30.949 --> 39:33.049
I just got back
from the hospital.

39:33.051 --> 39:35.185
It's still touch-and-go
with Heather,

39:35.187 --> 39:37.554
but she's through
the worst patch, so...

39:37.556 --> 39:39.990
- I'll be by her side every day.
- Good.

39:39.992 --> 39:41.791
Sam called with some more
good news.

39:41.793 --> 39:43.860
Looks like Ramsey's
enjoying his jail time

39:43.862 --> 39:45.495
with all the guys
he ratted out.

39:45.497 --> 39:47.296
Huh. I'm offended he
didn't call <i>me</i> first.

39:47.321 --> 39:48.721
I thought we were friends.

39:49.533 --> 39:51.701
I should tell you --
I did some thinking,

39:51.703 --> 39:54.571
and I'm having lunch with
those CIA recruiters next week.

39:56.340 --> 39:58.308
What is it?

39:58.310 --> 40:00.443
Well, I was wondering...

40:00.445 --> 40:03.280
Does, um, does it
ever get any easier?

40:03.282 --> 40:05.015
No.

40:05.017 --> 40:06.349
It never does.

40:10.788 --> 40:12.222
Well, can you
at least tell me this --

40:12.224 --> 40:14.925
if you could do it
all over again, would you?

40:14.927 --> 40:18.228
It's who I am. I don't know
how to be anybody else.

40:18.230 --> 40:22.165
Not really an answer, but
I guess, uh, I guess it'll do.

40:23.301 --> 40:24.734
Take care of yourself,
Michael.

40:35.936 --> 40:38.805
W-wait, so that's it
on the forensics, then?

40:38.807 --> 40:40.807
I want answers,
not excuses.

40:40.809 --> 40:42.609
All right, you know what?
Don't even bother.

40:42.611 --> 40:44.344
I don't want to read
a 20-page field report

40:44.346 --> 40:47.146
on how you found <i>nothing.</i>

40:47.148 --> 40:49.749
Langley's all over
my ass, Michael,

40:49.751 --> 40:51.718
and my leads are evaporating
left and right.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.219
Max's financial records,
nothing.

40:53.221 --> 40:54.621
Traffic cams, nothing.

40:54.623 --> 40:55.822
You better have brought me
something to chew on.

40:55.824 --> 40:58.124
Thank you.
Could be something.

40:58.126 --> 41:00.560
Found a burner cell
in the records you gave me.

41:00.562 --> 41:03.630
Phone was purchased
at a bodega on 6th.

41:03.632 --> 41:04.664
They have
a security camera?

41:05.800 --> 41:08.167
You already got
the footage.

41:08.169 --> 41:10.570
I don't want to know how.
I just want answers.

41:10.572 --> 41:13.640
Already sifting
through the tapes.

41:13.642 --> 41:15.708
I'll have something
to report soon.

41:15.710 --> 41:17.143
You'll have a report for me
tomorrow.

41:18.212 --> 41:19.679
Isn't that
what I just said?

41:21.782 --> 41:22.982
Uh, Michael?

41:24.551 --> 41:26.019
I'm counting on you here.

41:26.021 --> 41:28.888
So is Max's family.

41:33.927 --> 41:36.362
Mom? Got your call.

41:37.632 --> 41:39.265
Did you find something
on the tape?

41:39.267 --> 41:41.834
Michael, you need to tell me
what this is all about right now.

41:41.836 --> 41:43.069
I already told you.
My friend --

41:43.071 --> 41:44.404
you told me
that the security tape

41:44.406 --> 41:46.139
would lead to the man
who killed your friend.

41:46.141 --> 41:47.774
And I know you've spared me
some details.

41:48.809 --> 41:50.143
I need them now.

41:50.145 --> 41:53.012
The person
who killed my friend

41:53.014 --> 41:55.715
went to a lot of trouble
to make it look like <i>I</i> did it.

41:55.717 --> 41:58.051
I'm hoping the real killer
is on that tape.

41:58.053 --> 42:00.086
You need to see this.

42:09.697 --> 42:12.699
He has your posture,
your -- your walk.

42:12.701 --> 42:14.233
He's got you down,
Michael.

42:14.235 --> 42:17.670
Good luck convincing
anybody else it isn't you.

42:46.300 --> 42:47.366
He's got you down,
Michael.
