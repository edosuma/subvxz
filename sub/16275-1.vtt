<i>I had to, I had to
put my foot down</i>

00:42.665 --> 00:45.782

do well in school.</i>

00:45.905 --> 00:47.816
<i>And, and I-I did
my best with mine,</i>

00:47.945 --> 00:51.460

<i>A lot of mother
and father! Listen...</i>

00:54.145 --> 00:56.659

the big people!'</i>

01:02.426 --> 01:04.178
<i>for people who grow
up in foster care.</i>

01:04.346 --> 01:07.577
<i>And, you know, things can happen
to them and they can have a bad time,</i>

01:07.826 --> 01:11.501
<i>and they can end up, like, you know,
not in a good place, like, mentally,</i>

01:11.626 --> 01:13.139
<i>and a lot of the time physically,</i>

01:13.266 --> 01:18.977
<i>so it is a definite bonus to have,
like, a strong family background.</i>

01:20.066 --> 01:22.182

# A pregnant heroin addict
Who said she didn't plan it

08:37.076 --> 08:39.270
# So never thought to stop
Or ever kick the habit

08:39.395 --> 08:41.671
# Cos Kirby let her do it
And she knew he always had it

08:41.796 --> 08:43.707
# Down in the cellar with Trevor
Another addict

08:43.836 --> 08:46.191
# Who was at it like an asthmatic
Trapped in an attic

08:46.356 --> 08:47.709
# Suckin' on an asthma pump

08:47.836 --> 08:50.555

# Who by 1983 was in the National Front

08:52.637 --> 08:54.912
# He had a shaved head
But still got mashed on drugs

08:55.037 --> 08:57.392
# So Kirby didn't mind him
Hangin' round that much

08:57.517 --> 08:59.667
# Especially any time Janet
Came around to fuck

08:59.797 --> 09:02.152
# Get her fix while her kid, Chris
Waited around

09:02.277 --> 09:03.995
# A nine-year-old boy
Who was healthy and loud

09:04.117 --> 09:06.472
# Considering when she was pregnant
She was smoking the brown

09:06.597 --> 09:08.792
# She was lucky that he wasn't born
Disabled or Down's.

09:08.917 --> 09:11.112
# Still, when you're too loud
You get a clap round your head

09:11.237 --> 09:13.387
# Kirby ain't his dad
But he does what he says

09:13.517 --> 09:15.473
# Stays downstairs
in the cellar with Trev

09:15.597 --> 09:18.031
# While Kirby's upstairs
Giving Janet her meds

09:18.157 --> 09:19.988
# At least that's what they told Chris
Still he ain't that dumb

09:20.117 --> 09:22.472
# He knows Kirby's upstairs
Bangin' his mum

09:22.597 --> 09:25.350
# While he's left in the basement
With some racist cunt

09:25.477 --> 09:28.992
# Who's been waiting round for ever
For the motherfuckin' day to come

09:32.677 --> 09:34.589
# What an environment to raise a kid

09:34.718 --> 09:36.948
# Round crack dealers' houses
And racist pricks

09:37.078 --> 09:39.353
# Trevor looted the place
As well as maiming Chris

09:39.438 --> 09:41.508
# Left a permanent scar on his face
The same as his

09:41.638 --> 09:43.469
# With a razor blade
Yeah, it takes the piss

09:43.598 --> 09:45.748
# Whether you're prejudiced or not
Man, he's just a kid

09:45.878 --> 09:48.836
# But that's what Trevor done
No one ever saw him after that

09:48.958 --> 09:51.472
# Six years pass now
Kirby's cookin' up the crack

09:51.598 --> 09:53.395
# It's the new drug
Everybody's going crazy for

09:53.518 --> 09:55.634
# 1989 the year Chris
started selling draw

09:55.758 --> 09:58.511
# Picking up from Kirby
Scar there beneath his eye

09:58.638 --> 10:00.833
# You'd think that after everything
That's happened he would treat him right

10:00.958 --> 10:02.755
# Not par him off
With just another ounce of weed

10:02.878 --> 10:05.108
# Cos a quarter of the bag
Is a bunch of fuckin' seeds

10:05.238 --> 10:07.388
# Hundreds of 'em
And twigs the size of fuckin' trees

10:07.518 --> 10:10.032
# But if he ever moaned
He'd get a slap across his cheek

10:10.158 --> 10:12.274
# 1990 is the year that
really took its toll

10:12.398 --> 10:15.708
# Cos that's the year his mother Janet
Took an overdose of heroin and died

10:15.838 --> 10:17.431
# God rest her tortured soul

10:17.559 --> 10:19.754
# Now he's left to fend for himself
All by his own

10:21.999 --> 10:23.637
# It's 1995 Now that he's older

10:23.759 --> 10:26.353
# Stress weighs on his shoulders
Heavy as bolders

10:26.479 --> 10:28.037
# But he hides it from his olders

10:28.159 --> 10:30.719
# He's been living on the far side
Since he was a yoot

10:30.839 --> 10:34.149
# But the way he lives now is a far cry
From the way he did in the past

10:34.279 --> 10:37.077
# Cos he's made his way out
From sellin' ounces to bars of weed

10:37.199 --> 10:39.667
# Out in the streets
Where people do their nasty deeds

10:39.799 --> 10:42.552
# He sees they're making money
So he wants a larger piece...

10:42.679 --> 10:47.116
You fuckin' little cunt!
What do you think you're doing? Hey?

10:47.239 --> 10:49.070
That's our bread and butter,

11:10.480 --> 11:11.959
Hurry up. He's getting the gear.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.514

11:27.440 --> 11:29.431

12:03.961 --> 12:05.235
Kirby!

12:14.041 --> 12:15.520

12:19.161 --> 12:20.560
He's in the back.

12:25.762 --> 12:27.354
Let's sort it out.

12:39.522 --> 12:41.717
- All right, Chris?
- What's goin', Kirbs?

12:41.842 --> 12:44.276
- I've come for my stuff, bruv.
- Yeah. Cool, brother.

12:44.402 --> 12:46.518
- You got it, yeah?
- Of course I've got it.

12:47.762 --> 12:50.117
- You all right?
- Yeah, good. I always am, ain't I?

12:50.242 --> 12:51.800
Always good.

12:51.922 --> 12:54.641
- Just put it down on the table.
- No, take it, bruv. Count it!

12:54.762 --> 12:57.196
I don't touch money no more.
Put it down on the table.

12:57.362 --> 12:58.875
You're too big for money now?

12:59.002 --> 13:01.470
All right. So, come on, man.
I've gotta go.

13:03.882 --> 13:06.919
Turn my back for five minutes, innit?
Cheers.

13:07.042 --> 13:10.160
Hey! Just... Cool.

13:10.283 --> 13:12.018
Chris, what are you doin', man?

13:12.019 --> 13:13.753
Don't fuck about with me.
Give me my gear.

13:13.883 --> 13:15.601
There it is! There it is! Oi!

13:18.683 --> 13:20.514
Bruv, just give me my gear,
will ya?

13:20.643 --> 13:22.873
- I thought you was in a rush, bruv-
- I am in a rush!

13:24.403 --> 13:26.155
Listen. Listen, my friend.

13:26.283 --> 13:29.753
I've been away a little while
and before I went away,

13:29.883 --> 13:31.521
carrying the can for everyone,

13:31.643 --> 13:36.034
I had people like you running round
selling twigs and seeds for me.

13:36.163 --> 13:39.599
Do you remember runnin' round
with little batty boy and them?

13:41.163 --> 13:42.437
Think!

13:42.563 --> 13:45.521
Right, when I had you
running around for me, right,

13:45.643 --> 13:47.520
did I take the fuckin' piss?

13:47.643 --> 13:51.159
You might have been sellin' twigs
and seeds, but I still looked after you.

13:51.284 --> 13:53.161
- Now give me the fuckin'...
- You cunt!

13:53.284 --> 13:55.081
Kirby, just relax!

13:55.204 --> 13:56.796

13:56.924 --> 13:58.801
- Get the fuck off me!
- Relax yourself!

13:58.924 --> 14:02.121
- Get off me! You fucking little cunt!
- Just relax yourself!

14:02.244 --> 14:05.714
Listen! Give me my fuckin' gear!
Let go of my fuckin' head!

14:05.844 --> 14:08.916
- Give me my gear! I've got shit to do!

14:09.044 --> 14:11.638
Get off me, you cunt!
You're hurting my neck!

14:11.764 --> 14:13.436
- Oh!

14:13.564 --> 14:15.361
Here you are, Kirbs!

14:15.484 --> 14:17.281

- Oh!

14:17.404 --> 14:18.962

14:21.604 --> 14:23.879

Hey?

14:32.524 --> 14:33.798
Funny, innit?

You'll be laughing the other side of

16:40.127 --> 16:43.086
How long you gonna

I'm gonna wait for you, mate.

17:25.608 --> 17:28.362
Didn't your mummy and daddy

17:28.489 --> 17:30.798
Are you
some fucking philosophiser, mate?

17:30.929 --> 17:34.205
Sittin' here?
That's why you're so angry, mate!

17:34.369 --> 17:37.679
Who are you talking to, mate?
Carry on, cunt! Go on!

17:37.809 --> 17:39.606
Your mother was a prostitute!

17:49.569 --> 17:54.120
Shut up! You fucking cunt!
I swear I'll get you.

17:55.129 --> 17:57.643
Who do you send

17:57.769 --> 17:59.122
You don't know him, do ya?

18:01.769 --> 18:04.124
No one likes you!
No one loves you!

18:05.609 --> 18:08.761

Can you put your phone down?
We need to speak to you.

18:34.050 --> 18:35.369
Oh, fuck's sake!

18:35.450 --> 18:38.362
- All right...
- Put your phone down, please.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.247
What?

18:40.370 --> 18:42.440

18:42.570 --> 18:44.447
Stop swearing and take your hands
out of your pockets.

18:44.570 --> 18:46.481
I will tell you when we're done, OK?

18:46.610 --> 18:49.249

18:52.411 --> 18:55.448
- I ain't done nothing.

18:56.131 --> 18:58.042
And who are you exactly?

18:58.171 --> 19:00.890
My name's Jo Lloyd.
I work in social care for the council.

19:01.011 --> 19:02.842
And I used to be his social worker.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.569
It looks like it's your lucky night.

19:05.691 --> 19:08.364
Maybe your social worker
can teach you some manners.

19:08.491 --> 19:09.844
Yeah... Fucking pigs!

19:09.971 --> 19:12.439
- Oi! Can you just shut up?

19:12.571 --> 19:15.449
I'm standing here, making a fucking
phone call, minding my own business...

19:15.571 --> 19:19.120
- They start harassing me for no reason.
- Yeah, all right. They've gone now.

19:19.251 --> 19:20.650
What you doing here, anyway?

19:20.731 --> 19:22.483
You were meant to be
meeting me today.

19:22.611 --> 19:24.169
Oh, shit!

19:24.291 --> 19:27.886
Some madness happened. I've been
sorting it. I've been stressed. Sorry.

19:28.011 --> 19:31.128
Forget about it. That came for ya.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.406
I don't want that.

19:35.892 --> 19:38.725
You don't have to open it now, do you?
Just take it.

19:38.852 --> 19:41.127
- I don't wanna open it ever.
- Please. Just take it.

19:41.252 --> 19:42.970
One day you might feel differently.

19:43.092 --> 19:44.730
Humour me. Take it.

19:45.572 --> 19:46.800
Thank you.

19:47.292 --> 19:50.011
Anyway, stay out of trouble, yeah?

19:50.892 --> 19:52.769
Oh, and... take that hat off.

19:52.770 --> 19:54.646
And maybe the old bill
will leave you alone.

19:55.772 --> 19:57.046
Yeah, I doubt it.

20:09.892 --> 20:12.122

20:23.070 --> 20:24.565

What's this?

20:24.693 --> 20:27.332

20:27.453 --> 20:28.813
Back at the spot.

20:28.814 --> 20:30.172
I ain't gonna fuckin'

20:30.293 --> 20:32.352

20:35.808 --> 20:37.041
- Huh?

20:37.173 --> 20:38.811

20:38.812 --> 20:40.449

to make a call, innit?

20:40.573 --> 20:41.847
So it's at Kirby's house?

20:41.973 --> 20:44.248
Some crackhead
must have took it out of the house.

20:44.373 --> 20:47.285
- Some crackhead took it out the house?
- Yeah. I know who she is.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.211
I ask you to do one fucking thing for me
and you lost my phone?

20:50.333 --> 20:53.405
- Just use my phone and-
- Why am I gonna use your phone, hm?

20:53.573 --> 20:56.804
How are my cats gonna call your phone
when they don't know your number?

20:56.933 --> 20:58.890
Kirby's bellin' me now. Yeah?

21:00.414 --> 21:02.052
Yeah. Is it definitely her?

21:04.254 --> 21:05.573

21:05.654 --> 21:07.451
She better be there

21:08.494 --> 21:09.973
What the fuck is going on, bruv?!

21:10.094 --> 21:12.449
Safe. Bruv, it's there.

On her right now?

21:14.574 --> 21:16.087

21:23.014 --> 21:24.845
Don't fucking talk to me!

21:48.815 --> 21:50.567

21:50.695 --> 21:52.128
Look at all these fuckers.

21:52.255 --> 21:56.965

What if you don't find anyone?
My mum will be angry if I can't-

22:28.216 --> 22:30.127

22:30.256 --> 22:32.690
Well, then trust me, innit?

22:35.416 --> 22:37.134

- No.

22:37.256 --> 22:39.645
Yes, you did. You was wearin'
the Black King tracksuit earlier.

22:39.776 --> 22:40.874
I spill something on it.
What's the problem?

22:40.875 --> 22:41.971
I can't change my clothes.

22:42.096 --> 22:44.246
- What did you spill on it?
- Nurishment.

22:44.376 --> 22:45.365
Safe, man.

22:45.496 --> 22:48.294
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Can't see I'm talking? You dickhead!

22:48.416 --> 22:50.566
- What do you want?
- I want some weed.

22:50.656 --> 22:52.726
Does it look like
a man's blotting over here?

22:52.856 --> 22:55.245
Come on, man.
Why are you always darkin' me for?

22:55.376 --> 22:57.571
- Where's the money?
- It's here, man.

23:13.457 --> 23:14.731

23:14.857 --> 23:16.575
I want some weed, man.

23:16.697 --> 23:19.052

23:19.177 --> 23:20.815

23:20.937 --> 23:22.211
Hey, get off me, man!

23:22.337 --> 23:23.913
He's a yoot, man.
He's gonna start crying.

23:23.914 --> 23:25.488
Give him a chance, man.

23:25.617 --> 23:27.448
Allow me, man.
I just want my weed, man.

23:27.577 --> 23:29.807
Allow it, man. Come on, man.

23:36.657 --> 23:38.295
Is he your guy?

23:38.417 --> 23:41.215
Your guy over there.
Your guy with the beat-up Astroturfs.

23:41.337 --> 23:44.454
That's not my friend, man.
That's not my guy.

23:44.577 --> 23:47.967
I got him to steal the money from his
mum so I could pick up the draw, innit?

23:48.097 --> 23:49.576
- So he's not your guy, no?
- No.

23:49.657 --> 23:52.456
Go over there and smash him in
and I'll give you your weed.

23:53.138 --> 23:55.254
He-he's not your guy. Go on. Do it.

23:55.338 --> 23:56.737
Man, I can't do that, man.

23:56.858 --> 24:00.612

Move, man! You fuckin' idiot!
That's why you get parred!

24:12.738 --> 24:16.413
Cos you roll with man like that!
What the fuck do you think this is?

24:16.578 --> 24:18.296
Just allow it, bruv. Look at him, man.

24:18.418 --> 24:21.171
- Nah, man. He's been coming around...
- Come on, bruv. Look.

24:21.298 --> 24:22.617
He's baitin' me up, bruv.

24:22.778 --> 24:25.008
You got bait. Fucking bait...

24:25.138 --> 24:27.254
Let's be honest now.
You lot, shut up, man.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.577
Hey.

24:29.658 --> 24:31.296
Have you got the weed?

24:40.179 --> 24:41.453
Ooh!

24:48.499 --> 24:50.694
'Bang him in the back!'

24:55.859 --> 24:57.133
Bang him, man!

25:07.099 --> 25:10.933
He's still runnin'! He's still runnin'!

25:15.940 --> 25:17.373
You lot are hard.

25:18.820 --> 25:21.573
That's what I'm talkin' about, bruv.
That's how we move.

25:21.660 --> 25:25.619
Come on, man. Let's talk!
Yo, now you're rollin' with me, yeah?

25:26.380 --> 25:28.052
April, come here.

25:28.180 --> 25:30.694
- We gotta change these clothes, though.
- Why?

25:30.820 --> 25:33.573
They're not working.
They're too bright. You stand out.

25:33.660 --> 25:36.128
See why I'm always in black?
People can't pick me out.

25:36.820 --> 25:38.776
Don't worry, man.
We're gonna go shoppin'.

25:38.900 --> 25:42.097
Get you some new garms,
go to the shops and get you some pussy.

25:42.220 --> 25:43.494
You feel me?

25:49.660 --> 25:52.049
# Playing with fire

25:53.140 --> 25:55.017
# It doesn't burn

25:57.100 --> 26:00.013
# The first time your hand

26:00.781 --> 26:02.851
# Warms to the flame

26:04.741 --> 26:06.140
# Playing with fire...

26:06.261 --> 26:07.580
Firework!

26:08.461 --> 26:12.170
# Bitter and sweet, oh, no

26:12.301 --> 26:14.451
# Scorching skin now

26:16.421 --> 26:18.093
# Hell on its way

26:18.221 --> 26:20.052
# Playing with fire...

26:28.821 --> 26:29.970
Whoa!

26:52.382 --> 26:56.898
Bruv, I'm tellin' you that party
was off the chain, bro.

26:57.022 --> 26:58.899
Nah, fuck that, bruv.
Did you see that...?

27:00.062 --> 27:02.451
Oi, what did you do with that girl.
Did you fuck her?

27:02.582 --> 27:03.856
What girl?

27:03.982 --> 27:05.734
What the ting you was
all loved up on?

27:05.862 --> 27:08.092
What you on about, man?

27:08.222 --> 27:10.690
- You dickhead!
- Shut up and come on!

27:12.222 --> 27:14.417
Nah, but that party was
still sick, though.

27:30.663 --> 27:33.461
- You dickhead!
- What the fuck is that smell, man?

27:36.903 --> 27:38.894
- You fucking idiot!
- He pissed himself.

27:38.983 --> 27:41.019
Jammin' in your own piss,
you pussyhole!

27:45.903 --> 27:47.621
Stop fucking moving, you dickhead!

27:55.063 --> 27:57.054
OK. Look at this fuckin' pussyhole!

27:57.183 --> 27:58.935
Look in the camera!'

28:07.584 --> 28:09.017
Right, I'm goin' for a piss.

28:09.144 --> 28:10.941
Please, man...

28:11.064 --> 28:14.500
You think you can pick up drugs off me,
long me off and go to someone else?

28:14.624 --> 28:16.376
Where the fuck is my money?

28:17.584 --> 28:18.903
# He's just a kid

28:19.024 --> 28:21.618
# But he feels like the man today
He joined a gang today

28:21.744 --> 28:25.578
# Been at a house party around the way
Doing illegal shit but he's just a kid

28:25.704 --> 28:28.059
# Still he's in luck today
He got a fuck today

28:28.184 --> 28:31.017
# Yeah, he bust his very first nut today
In some stupid bitch

28:31.144 --> 28:32.418
# Today's moving quick

28:32.584 --> 28:34.142
# So quick if you wear the wrong shoes
You'll slip

28:34.264 --> 28:35.743
# Better keep up with the tempo
With the click

28:35.864 --> 28:37.502
# Cos they on some sick shit, bruv

28:37.624 --> 28:39.774
# Kidnapping wannabe rich-kid thugs

28:39.904 --> 28:44.500
# And no doubt now Jake's only mission Is
to better his position in Marcel's gang

28:44.624 --> 28:47.263
# It's a competition
To a little man with a disposition

28:47.384 --> 28:51.014
# Holier than thou he was born a Christian
All he worships now is the nihilism

28:51.145 --> 28:53.579
# Wise men will tell you
That with age comes wisdom

28:53.665 --> 28:55.940
# And you can't be saved by religion
Unless you have faith

28:56.065 --> 28:58.784
# So it makes no difference to the youths
That are raised in the system

28:58.905 --> 29:01.783
# Who don't have age on their side Or any
positive role models in their lives

29:01.905 --> 29:04.135
# That provide insight
So they ain't gonna listen

29:04.265 --> 29:06.699
# As for Jake
He's already made his decision

29:06.825 --> 29:11.694
# Now he's just another poster boy
For David Cameron's Broken Britain

29:11.825 --> 29:14.897
Shut up! Don't speak back!

29:14.985 --> 29:17.704
You pussyhole!

29:17.825 --> 29:19.224
Man up, fam!

29:21.905 --> 29:24.339
Fuckin' pussyhole! Look at him!

29:30.585 --> 29:34.295
Oi, come on. Let him have a drink.
His cousin's coming to bring the money.

29:34.426 --> 29:37.498
Where's your fuckin' heart?
He's been here for fuckin' two days!

29:41.786 --> 29:46.416
It's fuckin' piss!
You fuckin' bitch! You fucking...

29:49.466 --> 29:50.740
That's what I'm sayin'!

29:53.706 --> 29:54.980
All right, all right!

29:58.586 --> 30:00.144
# Playing with fire

30:02.426 --> 30:04.621
# It doesn't burn

30:05.786 --> 30:08.823
# The first time your hand

30:09.946 --> 30:12.665
# Warm to the flame

30:13.746 --> 30:16.136
# Playing with fire

30:17.587 --> 30:20.420
# Bitter and sweet, oh, no

30:21.107 --> 30:25.100
# Scorching skin now

30:25.667 --> 30:26.986
# Hell on its way

30:27.107 --> 30:29.860
# You're playing with
You're playing with fire...

30:29.987 --> 30:31.466
Oi! Come here!

30:33.027 --> 30:35.018
# It doesn't burn

30:36.707 --> 30:37.981
# The first...

30:40.187 --> 30:41.586
Sit down here, you.

30:42.507 --> 30:44.577
Right, where you been?

30:44.667 --> 30:46.623
- I've been round your house.
- In my house?

30:46.747 --> 30:48.578
- Yeah.
- And where were you going to?

30:48.707 --> 30:51.665
To get you that bio-carbonate stuff,
so you can wash your stuff.

30:51.787 --> 30:54.381
- You ain't got it yet?
- So you can clean your stuff, man.

30:54.507 --> 30:56.145
So you've cleaned the house, yeah?

30:56.267 --> 30:58.702
Is that Michelle still there, is she?
Or did she go?

30:58.828 --> 31:01.296
Erm... She left after you.

31:01.428 --> 31:02.827
Did she?

31:02.948 --> 31:04.763
I don't trust her, though.

31:04.764 --> 31:06.577
I think there's something
about that girl.

31:06.668 --> 31:09.580
What do you mean? What's wrong
with her? No one trusts you, do they?

31:10.508 --> 31:11.782
No one trusts you!

31:11.908 --> 31:14.502
You're a crackhead. She's crackhead.
No one trusts 'em.

31:14.628 --> 31:16.778
And you're a smackhead crackhead
like her.

31:16.908 --> 31:18.819
You're both like two peas in a pod.

31:18.948 --> 31:21.382
So just leave her alone.
She's a good shag, anyway.

31:22.068 --> 31:25.026
And you ain't, are ya?
Well, you're not, are ya?

31:25.148 --> 31:27.582
Look at ya. You know where
the chemist is, don't ya?

31:27.668 --> 31:29.863
- It's down the road.
- You're not with it, are ya?

31:29.988 --> 31:31.467
- Yeah-
- Get a fucking grip!

31:31.588 --> 31:34.182
What have you got to ask for?
Know what you're picking up?

31:34.308 --> 31:37.106
- Bio-carbonate-
- Bio? Bio...

31:37.228 --> 31:39.901
Bio-carbonate of soda,
so you can wash your stuff.

31:40.028 --> 31:41.223
I'm just gonna fetch that.

31:41.349 --> 31:44.785
"Bicarbonate" of soda. If you can't
even say it, how are you gonna get it?

31:44.909 --> 31:47.742
You'd come back with washing powder,
wouldn't ya?

31:47.869 --> 31:50.303
Bio-carb... Bicarb soda.

31:52.509 --> 31:56.821
I don't want any detergent, all right?

31:56.949 --> 32:00.169
I want a simple thing,
bicarbonate of soda!

32:00.170 --> 32:03.388
It comes in a little
fucking tin like that!

32:03.509 --> 32:07.582
Not in a big box like that
with "Daz" written on it, or whatever!

32:07.669 --> 32:09.944
OK? And if you don't fucking
sort it out...

32:10.069 --> 32:12.503
Listen! It's no good
fucking laughing. Prick!

32:14.789 --> 32:16.381
It's no good laughing!

32:16.469 --> 32:18.744
You want another fix,
what you gonna fucking do?

32:18.869 --> 32:21.337
- I'm clucking, Kirby.
- Get the fuck out of here!

32:21.469 --> 32:24.109
Look, just drink your tea
and pick up what I want.

32:24.230 --> 32:25.982
- Bi...
- I'll get it!

32:26.110 --> 32:28.101
Carbonate... of... soda.

32:28.230 --> 32:29.504
All right.

32:31.990 --> 32:34.345
I don't want that.
He's breathed all over it.

32:35.870 --> 32:37.861
Did you tell her we were here?

32:37.990 --> 32:39.582
Obviously, bruv. She's my friend.

32:39.670 --> 32:42.104
I'm goin', cos me and her
don't talk like that.

32:42.230 --> 32:44.824
- Oi, don't go, man. Don't go.
- No, I can't be bothered.

32:44.950 --> 32:46.429
Oi, what about your food, bro?

32:51.430 --> 32:52.988
- Thank you.
- Who ordered this?

32:53.110 --> 32:54.629
- She did.

32:54.630 --> 32:56.147
- Just eat it, man.
Don't worry about it.

32:57.950 --> 32:59.588
Er, excuse me?

32:59.710 --> 33:01.109
Oi, do I know you?

33:01.230 --> 33:02.504
- No.
- Nah.

33:02.630 --> 33:04.427
- You look familiar.
- Really?

33:04.590 --> 33:06.627
You know what they say
about a familiar face.

33:06.751 --> 33:08.025
What do they say?

33:08.151 --> 33:10.006
They say they're the most
beautiful people in the world.

33:10.007 --> 33:11.860
Like models and all that.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.300
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Thought of doin' any modelling?

33:14.431 --> 33:16.387
- Nah.
- Why not? You've got the legs for it.

33:16.511 --> 33:18.308
- You think so?
- Yeah! I know so!

33:18.431 --> 33:21.389
And you have.
You'd be a win double, wouldn't ya?

33:21.511 --> 33:23.149
Oh, that sounds nice!

33:23.271 --> 33:25.182
- Yeah, my mate would like you.
- Oh, yeah?

33:25.311 --> 33:26.585
Who's your mate?

33:26.711 --> 33:29.703
Er, his name's Nigel.
He works for... a modelling agency.

33:29.831 --> 33:31.423
You gotta meet him.

33:32.711 --> 33:36.147
Harvey, got a pen and a piece of paper,
mate, please? That's my number.

33:38.031 --> 33:39.510
- Don't give it out
to anyone, all right?

33:39.511 --> 33:40.989
- OK.

33:41.111 --> 33:42.669
- You promise?
- Promise.

33:42.791 --> 33:45.464
You'll be in trouble if you do...
Nah, only joking!

33:46.591 --> 33:47.819
All right, see ya later.

33:47.951 --> 33:49.226
- Promise?
- Promise.

33:49.352 --> 33:50.990
You can't break a promise, you know.

33:53.152 --> 33:54.631
Ooh, very nice.

34:09.152 --> 34:10.630
- Is that the bitch who
stoIe my phone, bruv?

34:10.632 --> 34:12.110
- Yeah, that's her.

34:12.232 --> 34:16.190
It's warm right now. The feds are doin'
rounds up and down. Let me deal with it.

34:19.272 --> 34:22.628
- Where the fuck is my boy's phone, huh?
- What phone?

34:22.752 --> 34:25.710
Don't fucking "what phone?" me.
I saw you at fucking Kirby's.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.710
You was there just before me.
Where the fuck is it? Bring it out.

34:28.831 --> 34:31.585
- I mean, what type of phone?
- How many phones you rob today?

34:31.672 --> 34:32.900
Had my shit out on the table.

34:33.033 --> 34:35.831
When I put it back in my bag,
I must have picked it up by mistake.

34:35.953 --> 34:38.148
- Where the fuck is it now?
- At my mate's house.

34:38.273 --> 34:40.786
- Where?
- Just round the corner!

34:40.913 --> 34:43.905
- All right! I'll take you now!
- Yeah! Come on then. Now!

34:49.353 --> 34:51.025
Oi! What you fuckin' doin' up there?

34:53.072 --> 34:55.792
Oi! What the fuck
are you doing up there?

34:55.913 --> 34:58.985
- Paul, can I have the fucking phone?
- I ain't got it, mate.

34:59.113 --> 35:01.229
Give me that phone!
Sit the fuck down, bruv.

35:01.353 --> 35:02.832
Sit down, you cunt!

35:02.953 --> 35:04.511
What the fuck you playin' at, huh?

35:04.633 --> 35:06.749
- I put it in there!
- It ain't in there now, is it?

35:06.873 --> 35:08.670
- Checked them downstairs?
- No.

35:08.793 --> 35:10.431
Come on then!
What are you playin at?

35:10.593 --> 35:13.027
My boy's a mad boy, you know!
I can't control him!

35:13.153 --> 35:15.622
What's goin' on, bruv?
What the fuck is goin' on, bruv?

35:15.754 --> 35:18.985
Start runnin' their pockets, innit?
Bring out a fuckin' silver phone!

35:19.114 --> 35:21.787
- What the fuck is goin' on?
- I'm gettin' your phone back.

35:21.914 --> 35:25.589
Come here! You're getting
my phone back, are ya, huh?

35:25.674 --> 35:27.585
Sit the fuck down!

35:29.354 --> 35:30.992
- I know someone.
- Oh, now you know!

35:33.274 --> 35:34.593
Fuck that!

35:34.674 --> 35:37.427
- She says she knows someone, all right?
- Oi, stand up!

35:37.594 --> 35:39.585
Come on. Move that way.

35:47.914 --> 35:49.188
Are you up for it?

35:49.314 --> 35:51.623
Bruv, are you gonna let her
do this for you?

35:51.754 --> 35:54.871
This was her idea.
How else is she gonna pay me back?

35:54.994 --> 35:57.304
She's a fucking crackwhore, bruv.
Are you blind?

35:57.435 --> 35:58.709
- I'm just sayin'.
- What?

35:58.835 --> 36:00.792
Just sayin' we ain't
lickin' shots out here.

36:00.793 --> 36:02.748
We're prostituting out a girl.

36:02.875 --> 36:04.593
- Let's go.
- Yeah? Come.

36:04.715 --> 36:07.183
Yeah? We'll just leave now
and you can pay me back.

36:07.315 --> 36:09.670
You can have a grand for me
by tomorrow, yeah?

36:10.635 --> 36:11.988
We'll do that then, yeah?

36:12.115 --> 36:13.707
Oh, fuckin' hell!

36:17.035 --> 36:19.674
He's not interested.
Let's just go somewhere else.

36:19.795 --> 36:21.513
That dirty cunt's not interested?

36:21.635 --> 36:24.195
- He's not up for it.
- Are you fuckin' mad?

36:26.995 --> 36:28.587
What's the matter, boss?

36:30.675 --> 36:31.949
You're not interested?

36:32.075 --> 36:33.827
- What, she's no good?
- It's too much.

36:36.275 --> 36:37.628
How much you got?

36:38.835 --> 36:40.110
£ 20

36:42.796 --> 36:44.673
Fuck it. Give it to me.

36:46.516 --> 36:47.790
Cunt.

36:48.436 --> 36:50.154
Fuckin' cheapskate cunt!

36:51.196 --> 36:53.073
- He's waitin' for ya.
- But he just said...

36:53.196 --> 36:54.948
Get the fuck in there!

37:02.276 --> 37:03.994
Fuckin' score, bruv!

37:05.516 --> 37:08.269
Don't tell me you made her
go in there for 20 fucking pound?

37:08.876 --> 37:11.071
That's all he was payin'. What?

37:19.836 --> 37:22.635
# She was once a princess
But now she's a mess

37:22.717 --> 37:24.230
# A fiend for a fix like the rest

37:24.357 --> 37:27.667
# Soliciting sex from pocketless
But she was a sweet thing nevertheless

37:27.797 --> 37:29.435
# Back in the day
Sexually abused as a child

37:29.597 --> 37:30.996
# She was always likely to
End up this way

37:31.117 --> 37:33.233
# The past lived
In the dark parts of her brain

37:33.357 --> 37:35.348
# And only heroin was there
To take away the pain

37:35.477 --> 37:39.186
# So she folded the foil and lit the flame
Inhale, exhale out once again

37:39.317 --> 37:41.467
# She's on the game
They all know her face

37:41.597 --> 37:43.747
# And the standard going rate
Just not her name

37:43.837 --> 37:45.395
# With only herself to blame
She lives this hell

37:45.517 --> 37:47.269
# But there's a million other girls
Just like Michelle

37:47.397 --> 37:49.388
# Out in the streets
With nothin' else to sell

37:49.517 --> 37:51.473
# To these desperate males
Other than themselves

37:51.597 --> 37:53.394
# So it's no wonder she's a thief to boot

37:53.517 --> 37:55.587
# On a constant search
For things that she can loot

37:55.717 --> 37:56.991
# What it's worth to her
And what it's worth to you

37:57.117 --> 37:59.347
# And the other way round
Vice versa's true

37:59.477 --> 38:01.354
# Cos she's an addict
And she's gotta support her habit

38:01.477 --> 38:03.513
# And she'll resort to all sorts of antics

38:03.637 --> 38:05.071
# Thieving's an impulse
She's always at it

38:05.198 --> 38:08.076
# It's automatic
She spares no thought about it

38:08.198 --> 38:12.271
# I've been dragging myself
To the lowest low

50:34.055 --> 50:35.488
You fucking whore.

50:42.655 --> 50:45.249
I'm gonna go and get me blower.
Leave the door on the latch.

50:45.375 --> 50:46.649
All right, sweet.

50:51.055 --> 50:54.206
- Bruv, it don't matter.
- We're givin' her the money back.

50:54.335 --> 50:55.735
- Fuck that!
- Yeah, fuck that.

50:55.856 --> 50:57.608
She never took your phone!

50:57.696 --> 51:01.052
- Fuck her! She took someone's phone.
- She never done nothin' to you!

51:01.176 --> 51:03.246
- Bruv-
- She didn't take your phone, innit?

51:03.376 --> 51:04.650
Fuck her.

51:06.616 --> 51:08.049
How much more do I owe?

51:14.616 --> 51:17.289
- How much more do I owe?
- You don't owe nothin'. Go then.

51:17.416 --> 51:20.055
Move. Just go, innit?

51:20.176 --> 51:21.609
- What?
- Just go.

51:21.736 --> 51:23.010
What's goin' on?

51:23.136 --> 51:25.445
Go on. Give it back then, bruv.

51:25.616 --> 51:27.208
- Shut the fuck up!
- Give it to her!

51:27.336 --> 51:30.772
Shut up, bruv. Leave it out, man.
Fuckin' leave it out. What's happenin'?

51:30.896 --> 51:33.205
- Here's your phone. Where's mine?
- Fuckin' hell.

51:33.336 --> 51:35.292
- Where's my one?
- What you talkin' about?

51:35.416 --> 51:37.408
- Where's my phone?
- You must have mine.

51:37.537 --> 51:40.176
- What you talkin' about, bruv?
- Well, where's my phone?

51:40.297 --> 51:42.413
What the fuck!
You think I've got your phone?

51:42.537 --> 51:44.095
Well, someone's got my phone!

51:44.217 --> 51:46.014
- You left your phone at Kirby's?
- Yeah!

51:46.137 --> 51:48.093
And you didn't thief my phone, no?

51:49.337 --> 51:51.055
- What, she took my phone?
- No!

51:51.177 --> 51:54.214
- She took my phone?
- I didn't take your phone!

51:54.337 --> 51:55.975
- You fuckin' took my phone?
- No!

51:56.097 --> 51:57.928
I took his phone and I paid him back!

51:58.057 --> 52:00.332
Nah, nah, nah, nah. Listen, yeah?

52:00.457 --> 52:02.015
- This is my phone, yeah?
- Yeah.

52:02.137 --> 52:04.287
She must have took your phone!
Fuck her!

52:04.417 --> 52:07.136
I didn't take your fuckin' phone,
you stupid cunt!

52:07.257 --> 52:10.374
Who you callin' a cunt?
Who you callin' a cunt?

52:12.177 --> 52:13.690
- Oi!

52:15.297 --> 52:17.174
- Give me the fuckin' money!
- Fuck that!

52:17.297 --> 52:19.492
- Give me the money!
- Get out of my face, bruv!

52:19.617 --> 52:22.416
I ain't tryin' to disrespect you, yeah.
That's off key!

52:22.538 --> 52:24.893
- That's off key!
- Why do you care about her, bruv?

52:25.018 --> 52:27.407
- Who the fuck is she? Your sister?
- Is it your money?

52:27.538 --> 52:29.813
- Whose fucking money is it?
- It's not your money!

52:29.938 --> 52:33.010
Who the fuck are you talking to?
First, get your fucking hands of me.

52:33.138 --> 52:35.208
Listen! Who's fucking holding
the money?

52:35.338 --> 52:38.967
Not you! Yeah?
So whose money is it, hm?

52:39.098 --> 52:42.613
Fuck her! She's a fucking crackwhore!
That's why she's in this mess, man!

52:42.698 --> 52:44.973
- Get up! Get up!
- I didn't do anything!

52:45.098 --> 52:47.373
- Lend it to me, innit?
- Lend this money to you?

52:47.498 --> 52:49.136
If it's your money. That's fucked up!

52:49.258 --> 52:50.850
Don't fucking move!

52:50.978 --> 52:53.538
- You want me to lend this?
- That's your money.

52:53.658 --> 52:56.491
Shut your fucking crying up!
Shut your crying up!

52:56.618 --> 52:58.370
You're a fucking pussyhole!

52:58.498 --> 53:01.695
Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!

53:01.818 --> 53:03.138
- What the fuck!

53:03.259 --> 53:05.454
- Take the money.
- I don't want no fucking money!

53:05.619 --> 53:09.373
What if I wanna take her down a dark
alley and give her a fucking belting?

53:09.499 --> 53:11.774
- What about that?
- She's dirty, bruv. Take it.

53:11.899 --> 53:13.730
- Just take the money, yeah?
- You cunt!

53:13.859 --> 53:15.133
Now, get up.

53:15.259 --> 53:17.614
Get up, get up, get up.

53:18.499 --> 53:20.854
Yeah? Get the fuck out of here now.

53:24.539 --> 53:26.177
Fucking pussy, man.

53:27.699 --> 53:30.930
Any madness. Any given day
some next madness. You know that?

53:34.219 --> 53:36.369
Why are you gettin' emotional, man?
Shut up.

53:36.499 --> 53:37.773
Emotional?

53:37.899 --> 53:40.777
You bring me here and do that shit
in front of me. Am I a dickhead?

53:40.899 --> 53:43.094
You're some prick.
You're some pussyhole.

53:43.219 --> 53:44.891
I'm a pussyhole
cos I'm not doing crack?

53:45.019 --> 53:48.137
- Yeah.
- All right. Fuck it! Do your ting.

53:48.260 --> 53:51.093
Do you wanna do it or not?
You ever done this before?

53:51.220 --> 53:52.972
- Nah.
- All right. Just watch me, yeah?

53:58.940 --> 54:00.851
Easy. Don't smoke it too fast.

54:00.980 --> 54:03.448
Lift it up.
Don't tip the bloody rock out!

54:03.620 --> 54:04.973
Did you get that?

54:10.140 --> 54:11.937
It didn't kill me, did it?

54:16.780 --> 54:18.293
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

54:18.420 --> 54:20.934
Chanel! Chanel! Wake up, please!

54:25.180 --> 54:27.375
No, please! No!

54:38.941 --> 54:40.215
Yo.

54:45.661 --> 54:47.811
Fucking hell!

54:51.261 --> 54:53.456
Do you want some action?

54:53.621 --> 54:56.215
- What you got on offer?
- I'm good for it, you know.

54:58.501 --> 54:59.854
Bruv, you see that?

55:01.181 --> 55:02.455
Bruv, you see that?

55:02.621 --> 55:04.612
- Do you want me?
- How much?

55:04.741 --> 55:06.174
- 50 quid.
- 50 quid?

55:12.022 --> 55:13.853
We'll go round this corner.

55:39.422 --> 55:42.778
Bang it, bang it
Bump it, dump it, scorch it, torch it

55:42.902 --> 55:44.620
Crash and burn it
Don't return it

55:44.742 --> 55:46.812
Lost deposit, let 'em earn it
Who cares?

55:46.942 --> 55:49.172
It's on the firm
It's a hire car, baby

56:06.623 --> 56:07.851
Safe, dude.

56:07.983 --> 56:09.939
- You all right?
- Course I'm fucking good.

56:11.063 --> 56:12.815
Take those, will ya? Thank you.

56:16.263 --> 56:18.094
All right, bruv. What you sayin'?

56:18.223 --> 56:20.418
- What are you up to, then?
- Just jammin', innit?

56:20.543 --> 56:23.774
Just jammin', yeah?
Not serving up gear in my pub?

56:23.903 --> 56:27.293
- How am I serving up gear?
- What, you think I'm fucking stupid?

56:27.423 --> 56:30.540
What, you're in and out of the toilet
like four times in ten minutes?

56:30.663 --> 56:32.301
- I wasn't calling you stupid.
- No?

56:32.423 --> 56:33.742
Search me. I'm not serving up.

56:33.943 --> 56:36.411
Let's have a drink.
Let's talk about it.

56:36.623 --> 56:38.501
I'm just giving my boy something...

56:38.704 --> 56:40.535
Here's one I wrote
for a special occasion.

56:40.664 --> 56:43.815
It's called 'Pity the Plight of Young
Fellows'. Do you wanna hear it?

56:44.024 --> 56:45.935
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna hear it?

56:46.064 --> 56:47.338
Yeah!

56:54.944 --> 56:56.900
# Pity the fate of young fellows

56:57.664 --> 56:59.734
# Too long a bed with no sleep

56:59.984 --> 57:02.179
# With their complex romantic attachments

57:02.384 --> 57:04.500
# Oh, look on their sorrows and weep

57:05.304 --> 57:07.818
# They don't get a moment's reflection

57:07.944 --> 57:10.856
# There's always a cloud in their eye

57:10.984 --> 57:13.214
# Pity the plight of young fellows

57:13.344 --> 57:15.494
# Regard all their worries and cry

57:16.144 --> 57:19.181
# Their Christian mothers
were lazy perhaps

57:19.304 --> 57:21.057
# Leaving it up to the school

57:21.185 --> 57:23.983
# Where the moral perspective
Is hazy perhaps

57:24.105 --> 57:26.744
# And the climate oppressively cool

57:26.865 --> 57:29.698
# Give me one acre of cellos

57:29.825 --> 57:31.941
# Pitched at some distant regret

57:32.065 --> 57:34.420
# Pity the fate of young fellows

57:34.545 --> 57:37.013
# And their anxious attempts to forget

57:38.025 --> 57:40.220
# These are the tears of a thug
Like murky water

57:40.345 --> 57:42.654
# Crying tears as clear as mud
For his father's daughter

57:42.785 --> 57:45.663
# His half-sister
He felt obliged to support her

57:45.745 --> 57:48.054
# Since her mum was poor
And her dad died even poorer

57:48.185 --> 57:50.096
# Separated until she was eight years old

57:50.225 --> 57:52.500
# He knew as soon as he saw her
That he adored her

57:52.665 --> 57:54.337
# Now he's payin' for her blood
with a borer

57:54.465 --> 57:56.421
# And an automatic weapon
Smith & Wesson

57:56.545 --> 57:58.137
# Split a fucking hole in your chest

57:58.265 --> 58:01.496
# He's looking to corner the perpetrators
Responsible for her killing

58:01.665 --> 58:04.305
# He's gonna murder every single
fuckin' one of them, God willing

58:04.426 --> 58:07.657
# It's eating him inside
Although you wouldn't be able to tell

58:07.786 --> 58:09.697
# By just looking in his eyes
Cos his tears cry inwards

58:09.826 --> 58:11.817
# Years of hiding his true feelings
From the streets

58:11.946 --> 58:14.938
# Have left him incapable of showing
Any other emotion than anger

58:15.066 --> 58:18.024
# So when Jody takes him
To Fat Mick's motors where Terry works

58:18.146 --> 58:20.865
# He don't ask questions first
Just straight bangs up

58:20.986 --> 58:24.183
# Mans with the butt of the gun
Turns it on Terry before he can run

58:24.306 --> 58:26.024
# And demanding answers

58:26.146 --> 58:29.263
# He knows Terry didn't kill Kirby
But he thinks he may have set him up

58:29.386 --> 58:31.820
# Why else would he have taken
The drugs afterwards?

58:31.946 --> 58:34.016
# Terry tries to explain
They were already dead when he got there

58:34.146 --> 58:36.341
# And the other girl, he can't remember
Her name but she was not there

58:36.466 --> 58:38.821
# Not there when he came back
Was before he went out

58:38.946 --> 58:42.063
# Chris stops him there
Arms stretched with the leng out

58:42.186 --> 58:44.495
# He says, "I know about the other girl
How the fuck do you think I found you?

58:44.666 --> 58:47.340
# "And I know you're fuckin' lying
So say your prayers now"

58:47.467 --> 58:50.220
# You fucked with the wrong gangster
And now you've gotta pay

58:50.347 --> 58:52.986
# That's when the blood-stained crackhead
He gun-butted on the way to Fat Mick's

58:53.107 --> 58:55.667
# Taps him on the shoulder
With a bust nose and fat lip

58:55.747 --> 58:57.783
# And says he knows
Who might have done it...

58:57.907 --> 59:00.785
I was gettin' a rock off Marcel
and I see Kirby behind the alley.

59:00.907 --> 59:02.420
Behind the barbershop in the alley.

59:02.547 --> 59:04.777
- What time?
- About midday. He pulled out a gun.

59:04.907 --> 59:06.943
He pulled out a gun!
I shit myself and I run!

59:07.067 --> 59:09.422
- You're lying!
- I'm not. I swear to God I'm not.

59:09.547 --> 59:11.060
I'm not. I swear to God.

59:11.187 --> 59:12.461
Get the fuck down!

59:14.227 --> 59:16.024
Fucking hell.

59:17.027 --> 59:19.939
- Fucking Marcel!
- Chris, it couldn't have been Marcel.

59:20.067 --> 59:22.217
How the fuck do you know
if it was Marcel or not?

59:22.347 --> 59:23.666
I met Marcel. I know him.

59:23.747 --> 59:27.137
- He's done my fucking nose, mate.
- Oh, fuckin' hell! Come on. Let's go.

59:27.708 --> 59:30.381
They guy who done it,
he was small. He was a kid.

59:30.508 --> 59:33.261
Fuck that! If he wasn't Marcel...
He's fucking involved!

59:33.388 --> 59:35.203
I'm not saying that.
But he couldn't have

59:35.204 --> 59:37.017
been the guy who
pulled the trigger.

59:37.148 --> 59:40.663
The guy who done it, man,
he was a kid. He was small.

59:40.788 --> 59:43.860
- Couldn't have been much older than me.
- I'm gonna take you home.

59:46.668 --> 59:50.741
'Motion sickness. Cases have been
popping up all over since...'

59:50.868 --> 59:52.938
- Want anything from the shop?
- Nah, I'm good.

01:00:05.908 --> 01:00:07.261
What the fuck!

01:00:07.388 --> 01:00:09.822
- Who the fuck killed Kirby?
- I don't know who done it!

01:00:09.948 --> 01:00:11.701
Tell me or I'm gonna blow your head off!

01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:13.660
- It was Jake!
- Who the fuck's Jake?

01:00:13.749 --> 01:00:15.341
Some yoot, bruv. Some hyped yoot.

01:00:15.469 --> 01:00:18.506
- Why the fuck did he kill Kirby?
- Kirby must have boy'd him off, man.

01:00:19.909 --> 01:00:22.423
So why was you running down the road
naked the other day?

01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:25.302
I must have banged some yet
and her man come home. I had to duck.

01:00:27.989 --> 01:00:30.264
- I'll dead him if you want me to.
- You'll do what?

01:00:30.389 --> 01:00:32.425
- I'll kill him for you.
- I'll do that.

01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:34.028
- Yeah?
- All right.

01:00:34.149 --> 01:00:35.787
- Know where this boy's at?
- Yeah.

01:00:35.909 --> 01:00:38.139
- Have you got a ride?
- Yeah.

01:00:38.749 --> 01:00:40.023
Let's go.

01:00:41.229 --> 01:00:43.743
# Pity the fate of young fellows

01:00:43.869 --> 01:00:46.064

01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:23.588
- Yo. What's goin' on?
- Cool.

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:26.429
This is Chris, yeah?
My man's your elder.

01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:28.743
Yo, fam. You cool, yeah?

01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:31.463
Cool, boss.

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:36.302
He just wants to have a chat, all right?
About you steppin' up.

01:02:36.112 --> 01:02:37.943
Come. Get out of the car.

01:02:40.672 --> 01:02:43.232
Come, man. I just wanna talk, man.
Come on. Let's go.

01:03:04.593 --> 01:03:06.982
So what, you're the bad man
that killed Kirby, yeah?

01:03:11.713 --> 01:03:15.103
So what you lookin' at him for?
Are you the bad man that killed Kirby?

01:03:18.833 --> 01:03:21.347
- Yeah.
- And a little girl, yeah?

01:03:21.953 --> 01:03:23.545
- I didn't mean to kill her.
- Huh?

01:03:23.673 --> 01:03:24.947
It was an accident.

01:03:25.793 --> 01:03:27.545
Do you know who that girl was, though?

01:03:28.793 --> 01:03:30.192
Nah.

01:03:32.113 --> 01:03:34.104
That was my fuckin' sister!

01:03:35.313 --> 01:03:37.128
- Oh, you never knew
that, is it, Marcel?

01:03:37.129 --> 01:03:38.942
- Nah, man.

01:03:39.073 --> 01:03:41.746
You sent a boy to do a man's job
and he fucked up!

01:03:41.873 --> 01:03:42.862
Chris, just allow it-

01:03:42.993 --> 01:03:45.872
Don't say my fuckin' name!
You don't fuckin' know me!

01:03:45.994 --> 01:03:50.033
You know what? Fuck this. Drop him.
Here you are. Stab him up.

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:53.068
Do it!

01:03:54.194 --> 01:03:55.832
I-I'm sorry about your sister.

01:03:55.954 --> 01:03:59.867
You can put one in Kirby's head, but
you can't kill this pussyhole? Do it!

01:03:59.994 --> 01:04:01.950
Jake, bruv, just... Come on.

01:04:02.994 --> 01:04:04.825
I can't. I can't do that.

01:04:04.954 --> 01:04:06.831
How the fuck do you
think you got here?

01:04:07.554 --> 01:04:09.784
How the fuck do you think
I know where you live?

01:04:09.914 --> 01:04:12.348
He offered to kill you earlier! For me!

01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:13.748
What?!

01:04:13.874 --> 01:04:15.546
Marcel, you set me up?

01:04:17.514 --> 01:04:19.664
Marcel, fuckin' talk to me, bruv!

01:04:19.794 --> 01:04:21.068
You set me up, bruv?

01:04:21.194 --> 01:04:23.310
That's it. Get mad.

01:04:24.154 --> 01:04:26.145
You fucking...
You fucking used me, bruv!

01:04:26.274 --> 01:04:27.993
- I didn't tell you
to kill that girl!

01:04:27.994 --> 01:04:29.711
- I didn't mean to!
If it wasn't for you-

01:04:29.835 --> 01:04:32.030
Get mad. Get mad.

01:04:32.155 --> 01:04:34.111
You fucking dickhead! You fucking snake!

01:04:34.235 --> 01:04:35.793
Kill him! Do it!

01:04:41.835 --> 01:04:43.268
That's it.

01:04:46.275 --> 01:04:49.392
That's it. That's it. You done good.

01:04:49.515 --> 01:04:52.666
You done good, you know. Uh-huh.
You're a bad man now. Huh?

01:04:54.195 --> 01:04:56.550
You're a bad man now.
Stop your fucking crying!

01:04:56.675 --> 01:04:58.950
You wanted to be a bad man!
You're gonna die now!

01:04:59.075 --> 01:05:00.349
You're gonna die now!

01:05:00.475 --> 01:05:02.864
- Look up!
- I love you, man! Give me a chance!

01:05:02.995 --> 01:05:06.544
Look up to me properly!
Stop your fucking crying!

01:05:06.675 --> 01:05:08.905
My sister was only 14
and you fucking killed her!

01:05:09.035 --> 01:05:10.947
She can't cry!
My sister can't fucking cry!

01:05:11.076 --> 01:05:12.714
Look at me!

01:05:13.596 --> 01:05:16.349
Put your head up like a bad man!
This is where you want to be!

01:05:16.476 --> 01:05:17.909
Look at me.

01:05:35.516 --> 01:05:36.915
Shit!

01:05:45.116 --> 01:05:47.471
- What you got?
- Fuckin' search me.

01:05:54.357 --> 01:05:55.676
OK.

01:05:55.757 --> 01:05:57.737
Here's one I wrote for
a special occasion.

01:05:57.738 --> 01:05:59.716
It's called Pity the
Plight of Young Fellows.

01:05:59.837 --> 01:06:01.111
- Carol?
- Yeah, darlin'?

01:06:01.237 --> 01:06:03.751
I've only gone
and lost my fuckin' key, ain't I?

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:06.266
Did ya? No, you didn't.
You left it in the door.

01:06:06.397 --> 01:06:07.750
- Did I?
- You did, yeah.

01:06:07.877 --> 01:06:11.153
Oh, thank God for that.
Oh, fuckin' hell!

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:14.674
Listen, it's not
half cold up there.

01:06:14.675 --> 01:06:16.670
Can you drop an heater
up to me or something?

01:06:16.757 --> 01:06:18.509
- Yeah, all right.
- Cheers.

01:06:18.677 --> 01:06:20.793
<i>Their Christian mothers
were lazy perhaps</i>

01:06:20.917 --> 01:06:22.396
<i>Leaving it up to the school</i>

01:06:22.517 --> 01:06:24.587
<i>Where the moral perspective is hazy</i>

01:06:24.717 --> 01:06:27.311
<i>And the climate oppressively cool</i>

01:06:27.437 --> 01:06:31.066
<i>Give me one acre of cellos
Pitched at some distant regret...</i>

01:06:33.237 --> 01:06:35.672
It's a bit difficult, though, innit?

01:06:35.798 --> 01:06:38.107
- 10.15 in the house?
- Yeah?

01:06:40.078 --> 01:06:42.876
My man will be here clockin'. He's CID.

01:06:42.998 --> 01:06:44.750
What are you talking about, bruv?

01:06:45.598 --> 01:06:46.872
My man here.

01:06:46.998 --> 01:06:49.387
Vince, as well.
I'll chat to you tomorrow.

01:06:49.518 --> 01:06:51.395
Look on their like and lament

01:06:51.518 --> 01:06:54.510
Approach with a cautious intent

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:56.555
Take it or leave it in any event...

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:11.318
Oh, bollocks! Yeah, it's karaoke, innit?

01:07:12.798 --> 01:07:14.550
Well, I'll be here then, won't I?

01:07:15.078 --> 01:07:18.310
Yeah, I'll have to be.
Listen, I gotta go, all right, babe?

01:07:18.439 --> 01:07:19.997
Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.

01:07:24.839 --> 01:07:26.909
Fuck! Fuck!

01:07:27.479 --> 01:07:28.753
Fuck!

01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:30.296
What the fuckin' hell's
goin' on in here?

01:07:30.297 --> 01:07:31.712
Oi! What the fuck!

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:33.591
What the fuckin' hell are you up to?

01:07:33.719 --> 01:07:35.994
- What you talkin' about, you mug?
- Who are you calling a mug?

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:39.156
- Are you pluggin' drugs in my pub?
- Drugs?

01:07:39.279 --> 01:07:41.156
Come on! Don't take me for
a fuckin' idiot!

01:07:41.279 --> 01:07:43.475
I had one in here the
other night tellin'

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:45.670
me he's not servin'
up in my pub!

01:07:45.759 --> 01:07:49.115
What am I, some prize fuckin' idiot?
I ain't havin' it, pal. It ain't on.

01:07:49.239 --> 01:07:50.911
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:54.190
Aaron and that other idiot, Ed.
Think I don't know what they're up to?

01:07:54.319 --> 01:07:56.037
It ain't on, pal!

01:08:00.199 --> 01:08:01.553
Cool, bro.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.796
Get the fuck out of my way!

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.757
What? What did you
say about my mum?

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.477
What did you say
about my mum, bruv?

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:22.032
Now come... Come here and say...

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.198
What you say about my mum, bruv?

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:31.198
Fucking come here and say that, bruv!

01:10:03.922 --> 01:10:05.196

01:10:15.803 --> 01:10:17.156
Oi!

01:10:17.803 --> 01:10:19.475
Oi! It's your fucking baby!

01:10:20.603 --> 01:10:22.958
Give me your number!

# This story's dark
Like the place where this story starts

01:10:51.003 --> 01:10:53.393
# Full of fiends and gangsters
With gory hearts

01:10:53.524 --> 01:10:55.799
# Drugged-up girls
Dressed up like naughty tarts

01:10:55.924 --> 01:10:58.040
# Performing sex
And perverted forms of art

01:10:58.164 --> 01:11:00.678

That needs fulfilling

For stealin' frequent there

# And have to make their way
Past people fuckin'

# Punters hooked on hookers
Hooked on smack cluckin'

01:11:22.204 --> 01:11:24.160
# Spent her days getting touched up
And fucked, fuckin'

# Wishing she could wake up
From the nightmare she was stuck in

01:11:27.204 --> 01:11:29.513
# But she weren't wakin' up from nothin'
This was her reality

# A place where dreams come true
For those who Iack morality

01:11:32.044 --> 01:11:34.353
# She had to get out
Not for her child, for her sanity

01:11:34.484 --> 01:11:37.557

Between this place and hell was gravity

01:11:44.765 --> 01:11:46.084
# Yeah

01:11:46.205 --> 01:11:48.799

The way that she escaped

01:11:48.925 --> 01:11:51.200
# She knew her chance would come
She just had to wait

01:11:51.325 --> 01:11:53.793
# Till one of her abductors
Made a mistake

01:11:53.925 --> 01:11:56.200
# Mixing vodka with heart pills
And smoking a straight

# With the door unlocked
Ain't the smartest idea

01:11:58.885 --> 01:12:01.001
# When your runnings are illegal
And your cargo live in fear

01:12:01.125 --> 01:12:03.685
# Her path was now clear
But only for her exit

01:12:03.765 --> 01:12:07.235
# Cos although ahead was long
And full of unexpected twists and turns

01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:09.362

how to cope

moments of uncertainty

# Finding out the truth
About her underworld connections

01:12:24.686 --> 01:12:28.122
# Sending her back to the brothel
Either that or simply just deporting her

01:12:28.246 --> 01:12:30.965
# She's met corrupted law before
She can't see them supporting her

01:12:31.086 --> 01:12:33.395
# So she goes along a road
That slowly starts destroying her

01:12:33.526 --> 01:12:36.279
# Not knowing where she's going
Or why God just keeps ignoring her

01:13:05.207 --> 01:13:06.481
How much?

01:13:07.687 --> 01:13:09.006
50.

01:13:09.127 --> 01:13:11.038
Fuckin' 50?

01:13:14.687 --> 01:13:16.439
Fuckin' brassin' with a baby?

01:13:18.007 --> 01:13:20.043
Here you are. 40 notes.

01:13:20.167 --> 01:13:23.364
Why don't you buy the little fucker
a dummy or something? Shut it up!

01:13:26.327 --> 01:13:27.919
Fuckin' disgusting!

01:13:48.128 --> 01:13:49.846
Who the fuck are you?

01:13:59.968 --> 01:14:02.277
You're one of them illegal immigrants,
ain't ya?

01:14:41.729 --> 01:14:43.208
It's OK. Oh!

01:14:43.329 --> 01:14:45.923
Come here. It's OK.

01:14:48.809 --> 01:14:51.687
Yeah. It's OK.

01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:11.204
What's the baby's name?

01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:14.726
No name.

01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:19.721
Poor kid. She ain't got a hope in hell.

01:16:31.211 --> 01:16:32.849
What the fuck are you doin'?

01:16:32.971 --> 01:16:35.167
Oh, God!

01:16:36.772 --> 01:16:38.683
Were my eyes open?

01:16:54.652 --> 01:16:56.529
Are you going somewhere?

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:58.764
Paddington.

01:16:58.892 --> 01:17:00.450
I'll take ya.

01:17:11.812 --> 01:17:13.325
I've got the tickets, all right?

01:17:14.692 --> 01:17:18.925
Look, I just need you to wait here
for two minutes. I'll be right back, OK?

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:45.521
It's her!

01:18:29.134 --> 01:18:30.726
# I'm still waiting for the sign

01:18:30.854 --> 01:18:32.651
# And you're the only one...

01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:36.568
What the fuck! Oi!

01:18:39.254 --> 01:18:40.846
Give me your number!

Stop!

01:19:21.255 --> 01:19:22.734
Stop!

01:19:23.975 --> 01:19:25.648
Oi, mister! Follow that car!

01:19:25.736 --> 01:19:27.374
- I can't, love.
- I'll sort you out!

01:19:41.936 --> 01:19:43.688
Just wait here!

01:19:51.176 --> 01:19:52.450
What the fuck!

01:20:04.416 --> 01:20:06.168
Fucking madness!

01:20:10.417 --> 01:20:11.691
Oh...

01:20:15.497 --> 01:20:17.886
Oh, fuck!

01:20:32.097 --> 01:20:33.894
Fucking baby!

01:20:51.218 --> 01:20:53.891
- You got a ticket there, mate? Ticket?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:55.418 --> 01:20:56.692
No problem, mate.

01:21:11.778 --> 01:21:13.575
Get those fucking
bitches out of here!

01:21:13.698 --> 01:21:15.768
Come here, you fucking...

01:21:19.578 --> 01:21:21.057
You're fucking history!

01:21:44.659 --> 01:21:47.298
Quickly! Go! Go, go!

01:21:49.659 --> 01:21:51.650
Hurry! Quickly! Faster!

01:21:51.739 --> 01:21:53.013
Come on!

01:21:56.299 --> 01:21:57.732
Go!

01:22:07.099 --> 01:22:08.976
Ed!

01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.458
What the fuck is that?

01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:23.093
- It's a baby, innit?
- What, you stole someone's baby?

01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:24.972
Bruv, some woman left it on a train.

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:26.897
And you're bringin' it here to me?

01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:30.454
Look, bruv, it's more complicated
than that, yeah?

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:34.376
Where the fuck did you get that? Hm?

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.172
- Well, I found it, innit?
- Where?

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:37.574
I just found it.

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:40.373
Just like that, yeah?
So why you bringin' it to me then?

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.697
I'm on the fuckin' train with the piece.
I got the reload on me, like.

01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:46.459
About 20 feds with sniffer dogs
pop out of nowhere.

01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:48.577
I fuckin' had to
dash it somewhere.

01:22:48.578 --> 01:22:50.573
I hid it in the pram
with the baby, innit?

01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.730
- What, you hid it with the baby?
- Yeah, innit?

01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:57.091
That's the smartest thing you've done
in your dickhead life! What now?

01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:00.691
What you gonna do with this?
Give it to the feds?

01:23:00.821 --> 01:23:02.573
- I can't give it to the feds.
- Why not?

01:23:02.701 --> 01:23:04.293
I popped past the feds with it once.

01:23:04.421 --> 01:23:06.651
Am I gonna go back
like I fuckin' changed my mind?

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:08.817
I'll look like a paedo.

01:23:09.421 --> 01:23:12.811
Well, call social services then.
What? Hm?

01:23:14.461 --> 01:23:17.498
Nah, if we do that,
they're gonna put it in a home, innit?

01:23:17.661 --> 01:23:19.572
- So what?
- Nah, that's not the one, bruv.

01:23:19.701 --> 01:23:21.453
- We grew up in homes, man.
- Exactly.

01:23:21.581 --> 01:23:23.060
Exactly what, bruv?

01:23:23.181 --> 01:23:26.139
Some woman's just abandoned
her yoot on a train!

01:23:26.261 --> 01:23:28.331
And she obviously don't want it, man.

01:23:28.901 --> 01:23:31.859
Bruv... what the fuck is that smell?

01:23:32.661 --> 01:23:35.459
Hm? What the fuck is that smell, bruv?
It's disgusting, man!

01:23:35.581 --> 01:23:37.776
I'll have to change
its fuckin' nappies now!

01:23:40.221 --> 01:23:43.373
Give me the gun while you do that.
Let me look after it for you, innit?

01:23:43.502 --> 01:23:45.379
Is it? You gonna help me find its mum?

01:23:45.502 --> 01:23:49.017
Nah. I've got better things to do
with my time than run around like that.

01:23:49.142 --> 01:23:50.575
But you carryin' that, bruv...

01:23:50.702 --> 01:23:53.535
Just give me the gun and I'll
hide it somewhere for you, innit?

01:23:55.502 --> 01:23:57.413
Nah, it's all right. I'm gonna hold it.

01:23:57.542 --> 01:23:59.658
You don't want no help?
You're a prick, bruv.

01:24:00.182 --> 01:24:01.979
Come. Give me the tings.

01:24:03.182 --> 01:24:04.581
Oh, shi...

01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:08.335
- Don't tell me you put it in there!
- I had to hide it somewhere!

01:24:08.462 --> 01:24:10.498
What you puttin'
it in there for, man?

01:24:13.902 --> 01:24:16.132
Take it then!

01:24:16.262 --> 01:24:17.661
You'd better clean that.

01:24:22.822 --> 01:24:25.815
You're a prick, bruv.
When you're done fuckin' about, yeah...

01:24:25.943 --> 01:24:29.538
Nah, when you're done fuckin'
about, yeah, you call me, yeah?

01:24:29.663 --> 01:24:32.177
Cos we've got fuckin' things to do,
you prick, yeah?

01:24:32.303 --> 01:24:34.055
- All right!
- Fuckin' daddy boy!

01:24:34.183 --> 01:24:35.741
- Dickhead!
- Fuck off, man!

01:24:46.023 --> 01:24:47.422
Oh, for...

01:24:48.303 --> 01:24:50.453
You take the piss.
You know that? Oh!

01:25:02.383 --> 01:25:03.862
You laughin' at?

01:25:07.784 --> 01:25:09.502
Oh, man! Allow it.

01:25:09.664 --> 01:25:11.541
- I'm not even on it.
- Dickhead!

01:25:12.864 --> 01:25:15.139
Get off!

01:25:17.864 --> 01:25:19.456
Get off!

01:25:20.224 --> 01:25:22.658
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:25:22.744 --> 01:25:24.575
- Get the fuck out!
- Dickhead! Fuck off!

01:25:24.704 --> 01:25:25.978
Dickheads!

01:25:26.104 --> 01:25:27.696
Come with me, Jody. I need your help.

01:25:27.824 --> 01:25:29.655
- Can Ashley come?
- Nah.

01:25:29.784 --> 01:25:32.423
- All right. I'll call you later. Bye.
- Bye.

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:33.818
Come here.

01:25:33.944 --> 01:25:35.775
They always fuckin' try it. Always.

01:25:39.464 --> 01:25:42.501
We're smashed in here, Jody.
I'll see you in a bit, yeah?

01:25:43.384 --> 01:25:44.658
- Oi...
- Yeah?

01:25:46.184 --> 01:25:47.822
You're not gonna find her, you know.

01:26:21.225 --> 01:26:22.499
Yeah?

01:26:22.665 --> 01:26:25.498
<i>You still fuckin' about
tryin' to find that yoot's mum?</i>

01:26:25.665 --> 01:26:27.417
- Yeah.
- 'I've sorted it, man.

01:26:27.545 --> 01:26:31.174
<i>Come see me down the Essex, innit?
Bring the yoot with you, yeah?</i>

01:26:31.305 --> 01:26:33.820
I'm a bit nervous to be honest, love.

01:26:33.946 --> 01:26:36.699
What you got to be nervous about?
We'll sort this out.

01:26:36.826 --> 01:26:39.386
- How much is in there?
- It don't matter, does it?

01:26:39.506 --> 01:26:41.019
Come on.

01:26:41.146 --> 01:26:44.741
- I don't know. How old is she?
- I haven't got a clue, honey.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:47.460
All right? Thanks, darlin'.

01:26:47.586 --> 01:26:50.054
Oh, my God! She's lovely!

01:26:50.186 --> 01:26:51.938
- What's goin' on?
- She's gorgeous!

01:26:52.066 --> 01:26:54.899
- Come through, bruv.
- Take that, man. Take that.

01:26:55.026 --> 01:26:56.539
- Bruv...
- It's cool, man. Cool.

01:26:56.666 --> 01:26:59.658
- You want this mess sorted out, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:26:59.786 --> 01:27:01.458
Well, I was speaking to Vince...

01:27:01.586 --> 01:27:04.100
- She's lovely!
- And Carol can't have kids.

01:27:05.706 --> 01:27:08.095
That's a kid whose mother
doesn't want it, bruv.

01:27:08.226 --> 01:27:10.456
She does, man. Problem solved.

01:27:12.666 --> 01:27:14.179
What is this, bruv?

01:27:14.306 --> 01:27:16.184
What the fuck do you think
is in there?

01:27:18.307 --> 01:27:19.979
What the fuck you doin', bruv?

01:27:20.107 --> 01:27:22.177
Fuck that, bruv.
That's not your baby, man.

01:27:22.307 --> 01:27:24.025
Don't worry! Don't worry!

01:27:24.147 --> 01:27:26.377
- Bruv, that's not your baby.
- Come on, bruv!

01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:28.338
What the fuck is the matter
with you, man?

01:27:28.467 --> 01:27:30.742
Don't worry, darlin'.
Just give us a minute, yeah?

01:27:30.867 --> 01:27:32.761
- What you actin' like
a little bitch for?

01:27:32.762 --> 01:27:34.655
- Who the fuck are you,
bruv, Jeremy Kyle?

01:27:34.787 --> 01:27:36.061
- What, you shook?
- Nah.

01:27:36.187 --> 01:27:39.418
- Think this is coming back to you?
- You can't give someone's baby away!

01:27:39.547 --> 01:27:41.503
And to fucking Vince and Carol?
Are you mad?

01:27:41.667 --> 01:27:44.420
We were fuckin' sellin' crackwhores
to him the other day!

01:27:44.547 --> 01:27:46.424
She's gonna look after it, not him.

01:27:46.547 --> 01:27:49.015
Can you see it over there, man?
She's gonna be lovin'.

01:27:49.147 --> 01:27:51.297
- See her fuss over it?
- That's not the real mum!

01:27:51.427 --> 01:27:53.145
Where is the real mum, hm?

01:27:53.267 --> 01:27:55.781
- Where's the real mum, bruv?
- I'm fuckin' lookin'!

01:27:55.907 --> 01:27:58.263
You been lookin' for her.
Have you found her yet, hm?

01:27:58.388 --> 01:28:01.346
Nah, bruv, you ain't found her
cos she don't wanna be found, man.

01:28:01.468 --> 01:28:03.823
Be real. She's gone.
She ain't coming back, bruv.

01:28:03.948 --> 01:28:05.825
So we've got two options now, yeah?

01:28:05.948 --> 01:28:11.386
Either we let them take this now, yeah?
Or we call social services.

01:28:11.508 --> 01:28:12.941
You wanna call social services?

01:28:13.068 --> 01:28:15.946
And they'll go and give this baby
to some other Vince and Carol.

01:28:17.508 --> 01:28:18.987
- Nah, man.

01:28:18.988 --> 01:28:20.466
- What difference is
it gonna make to us?

01:28:20.588 --> 01:28:22.226
Hm? To us?

01:28:22.348 --> 01:28:23.747
Apart from this.

01:28:24.948 --> 01:28:27.416
- I can't fuckin' take that, bruv.
- Open it up, bruv.

01:28:32.108 --> 01:28:33.382
Do you see that, bruv?

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:35.419
This is so fucked up! You know that?

01:28:35.548 --> 01:28:38.506
Bruv, there's four grand there. Each.

01:28:51.549 --> 01:28:52.823
Yeah?

01:28:52.949 --> 01:28:54.905
- Come.
- Get off me, bruv.

01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:56.985
- Fuckin' hell.
- I toId you I'd sort it, man.

01:28:57.109 --> 01:28:59.225
What am I gonna say to everybody?

01:28:59.349 --> 01:29:01.107
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

01:29:01.108 --> 01:29:02.864
Don't worry about that yet.
Hello!

01:29:02.989 --> 01:29:05.059
Everythin' all right, yeah?
Is he all right?

01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:08.306
- Yeah, he's all right. All right?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:29:27.670 --> 01:29:28.989
Fuck!

01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:36.898
Fuck!

01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:53.104
- Where's my bag?
- What bag? What you talkin' about?

01:29:53.230 --> 01:29:54.709
My bag with my stuff in it!

01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:56.548
Look at the place! It's a shithole.

01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:59.586
- What you doin'?
- Just gettin' my stuff!

01:29:59.710 --> 01:30:01.302
You ain't got anything?

01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:04.547
I've got a little you can have,
but don't tell anyone we were here!

01:30:04.670 --> 01:30:06.183
- No, of course not.
- Here.

01:30:07.791 --> 01:30:10.021
All right, boss? £ 10 electric, yeah?

01:30:14.071 --> 01:30:17.780
You're gonna have half of that
and you give me the rest back.

01:30:17.911 --> 01:30:19.230
- Of course!
- Michelle!

01:30:19.351 --> 01:30:21.421
- What?
- Michelle!

01:30:21.551 --> 01:30:22.825
- Look!
- Who is it?

01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:25.067
- Him, him, him!
- Come on.

01:30:25.191 --> 01:30:26.465
Come on!

01:30:30.671 --> 01:30:32.309
- Where is it?
- What the fuck!

01:30:34.991 --> 01:30:37.141
I can't believe you sold
a fucking baby!

01:30:38.071 --> 01:30:39.345
Actually... yeah, I can.

01:30:39.471 --> 01:30:42.861
Fuck you! I've been walking around all
day looking for this one, all right?

01:30:42.991 --> 01:30:45.300
I told you
I couldn't bring it to the fucking feds.

01:30:45.431 --> 01:30:47.501
You didn't want it back before,
did you?

01:30:47.671 --> 01:30:50.027
It's done now. I'm sorry.

01:30:50.152 --> 01:30:53.667
What were you gonna fuckin' do? Take
the baby and go back to being a tramp?

01:31:06.112 --> 01:31:07.386
All right, listen, listen.

01:31:07.512 --> 01:31:11.061
If I go through all this stress, I lose
my fucking money over it, everything,

01:31:11.192 --> 01:31:14.229
then you got to chat
to someone proper, yeah?

01:31:14.912 --> 01:31:16.664
Nice lady.

01:31:16.752 --> 01:31:19.949
She'll sort it all out.
She knows people. My social worker.

01:31:20.712 --> 01:31:22.384
That's how it's running.

01:31:22.512 --> 01:31:23.865
Deal?

01:31:26.592 --> 01:31:27.991
Deal.

01:31:30.432 --> 01:31:31.831
All right, then.

01:31:33.593 --> 01:31:36.426
All right, wait here.
Don't go fuckin' stealing anything.

01:32:09.433 --> 01:32:11.105
Shithouse!

01:32:11.233 --> 01:32:12.825
So I'm fuckin' her, right?

01:32:13.673 --> 01:32:17.428
This baby will not stop fuckin' crying.
It's givin' it the fuckin' big licks.

01:32:17.554 --> 01:32:19.988
Shut it up, yeah?
I'm losing my fuckin' hard-on here.

01:32:20.114 --> 01:32:23.106
She's like...
It's a baby. Babies cry.

01:32:24.834 --> 01:32:27.428
I'm like, "How about fuck off?"
Yeah? I'm doin' one.

01:32:28.474 --> 01:32:30.749
- Oi!
- Oh, hello! You all right?

01:32:32.874 --> 01:32:35.263
- What's goin' on there?
- I don't know.

01:32:35.394 --> 01:32:37.464
You wanna go and party? Yeah?

01:32:52.074 --> 01:32:54.793
- Where's my fucking gun?
- What's the matter with you, bruv?

01:32:54.914 --> 01:32:57.907
Listen, listen. You've been
storing drugs in the pub, right?

01:32:58.035 --> 01:33:00.105
- What?
- In the toilet in the fucking pub!

01:33:00.235 --> 01:33:01.509
Yes, man.

01:33:01.675 --> 01:33:05.031
Either you or your idiot bredren have
got my fucking gun and I need it back.

01:33:05.155 --> 01:33:06.429
Do you understand me?

01:33:06.555 --> 01:33:07.829
I need it back.

01:33:08.715 --> 01:33:10.513
You've got two hours
to get me my gun back

01:33:10.514 --> 01:33:12.310
or I'm gonna burn
down people's houses.

01:33:13.195 --> 01:33:16.107
All right, man. All right.

01:33:33.875 --> 01:33:36.105
- Who's that?
- I dunno.

01:33:37.235 --> 01:33:39.510
- Hello.
- I'm gone.

01:33:39.675 --> 01:33:41.314
All right, I'll call you tomorrow.

01:33:42.396 --> 01:33:43.715
You all right?

01:33:47.596 --> 01:33:49.154
Fuck!

01:33:50.956 --> 01:33:53.948
Come on. You'll be all right.
That's it.

01:33:54.076 --> 01:33:55.350
Carol?

01:33:55.476 --> 01:33:56.989
- Carol?
- Yeah?

01:33:57.116 --> 01:33:59.550
- Come here!
-  Oh, bloody hell!

01:33:59.676 --> 01:34:02.793
He's always spoiling
things, isn't he, eh?

01:34:02.916 --> 01:34:05.225
- Carol!
- All right!

01:34:05.356 --> 01:34:08.268
Get the baby, put her in the bedroom
and stay in there, all right?

01:34:08.396 --> 01:34:09.385
All right!

01:34:21.756 --> 01:34:23.429
I'll be back in a minute.

01:34:27.997 --> 01:34:29.874
Are you fuckin' off your rocker or what?

01:34:34.397 --> 01:34:37.275
Pain in the bloody arse! Fuckin' hell!

01:34:41.597 --> 01:34:45.351
What you doin' bringing that fuckin'
whore in my pub with my missus upstairs?

01:34:45.477 --> 01:34:47.672
- I've got a good reason.
- It had better be!

01:34:47.757 --> 01:34:49.156
Let me sort it out then.

01:34:50.117 --> 01:34:52.312
What's goin' on?

01:34:52.437 --> 01:34:54.155
Oi, listen, I'll explain, yeah?

01:34:54.837 --> 01:34:57.988
Basically, a bit of a...
Ed should never have sold you the baby.

01:34:58.117 --> 01:34:59.915
I didn't want to, but
when I came down

01:34:59.916 --> 01:35:01.712
here, I didn't know
this was gonna happen.

01:35:01.837 --> 01:35:04.397
I spent the whole day looking
for the mum and that's her.

01:35:07.598 --> 01:35:09.429
And she wants the baby back.

01:35:15.518 --> 01:35:19.830
She was turning tricks with some heavy
fucking Russians who got her banged up.

01:35:19.958 --> 01:35:21.813
She thought they were
gonna kill the baby.

01:35:21.814 --> 01:35:23.667
So she fucking left
it on the train.

01:35:30.598 --> 01:35:32.453
Now here's the money
and I'll give you the

01:35:32.454 --> 01:35:34.307
rest of it when I get
in touch with Ed.

01:35:34.438 --> 01:35:37.157
Now you've got to give the baby back
cos she ain't yours.

01:35:37.278 --> 01:35:38.615
- She ain't havin' the baby back.
I'm sorry.

01:35:38.616 --> 01:35:39.951
- Yes, she is.

01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:45.236
You know what?
That is fucking brilliant, pal!

01:35:45.358 --> 01:35:48.715
A bit elaborate. You know what I mean?
You came in here three hours ago.

01:35:48.839 --> 01:35:50.670
I give you eight fucking
bags for a baby

01:35:50.759 --> 01:35:53.512
and now you want the baby back
with half the money?

01:35:53.679 --> 01:35:55.510
What a fucking prize cunt or what?

01:35:55.679 --> 01:35:58.591
Look at her. Done up very well.
Yeah, looks good, innit?

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:04.191
Russian gangsters, babies on trains
and where the fuck's Ed?

01:36:04.319 --> 01:36:07.117
You walk in with Ed.
Am I gonna get four grand back off Ed?

01:36:07.239 --> 01:36:09.070
- I don't think so, do you?
- Yeah.

01:36:09.199 --> 01:36:11.349
- You do, do ya?
- That's half of it there.

01:36:11.479 --> 01:36:13.095
A load of bollocks, pal.

01:36:13.096 --> 01:36:14.710
You can shove it right up your arse.
No chance!

01:36:14.839 --> 01:36:17.148
- It's not your baby.
- What are you talking about?

01:36:17.279 --> 01:36:19.349
Don't worry.
It's a scam. Can't you see it?

01:36:19.479 --> 01:36:21.834
It's not a fuckin' scam, Vince,
and you know it!

01:36:21.959 --> 01:36:24.757
- It's her baby! She's the mother!
- Shut your mouth!

01:36:24.879 --> 01:36:27.552
Can't understand it
without a cock in your mouth, can ya?

01:36:27.719 --> 01:36:30.392
It's all right when it's your
fuckin' cock in my mouth!

01:36:30.519 --> 01:36:33.114
Hold on a minute.
What did she just say then?

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:36.915
She's a brass. She's always got a cock
in her mouth. What did you think I said?

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.634
No, she said your cock
in her mouth.

01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:44.054
Do I look like I'm
fuckin' lying?

01:36:44.055 --> 01:36:45.948
And if I am fuckin'
lying, go get the baby.

01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:49.231
And give it to them,
cos that's what they fuckin' want!

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:51.198
- I ain't giving them
the fucking baby back!

01:36:51.199 --> 01:36:53.035
- Well, they ain't
getting it either!

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:55.278
You stupid bitch!

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.913
Oi! Oi!

01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.190
Come here! Fucking... Oi!

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:00.719
Fuck off! Fucking slag!

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.956
Settle the fuck down, all right?

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:06.758
Right, now you, get the fuck upstairs
and get the baby!

01:37:14.121 --> 01:37:17.079
Come on. It's all right. It's all right.

01:37:25.041 --> 01:37:26.315
Oi!

01:37:38.441 --> 01:37:40.079
What the fuck.

01:37:40.201 --> 01:37:41.600
What the fuck!

01:37:43.081 --> 01:37:44.355
What the fuck!

01:38:14.482 --> 01:38:16.234
Carol! It's the wrong fucking number!

01:38:16.362 --> 01:38:19.001
I think it's number eight!
No, number nine!

01:38:26.642 --> 01:38:27.961
Vince! Fucking hell!

01:38:33.042 --> 01:38:34.998
Ed! Where the fuck is the gun, man?

01:38:35.122 --> 01:38:36.999
There's a fuckin' fire goin' on, bruv!

01:38:37.122 --> 01:38:40.001
That's Chris's fucking gun, man!
He knows you took it!

01:38:40.123 --> 01:38:42.273
- I had to bring her down!
- Where the fuck is it?

01:38:42.403 --> 01:38:44.439
Bruv, top floor, man. All right?

01:38:44.563 --> 01:38:47.031
Wait. Where's the baby? Where is it?

01:38:47.763 --> 01:38:50.596
What room?
Ed, the baby's still up there, bruv!

01:39:08.323 --> 01:39:10.041
Fuck!

01:39:34.604 --> 01:39:36.196
Aaron!

01:39:38.844 --> 01:39:40.596
Ed! Here!

01:39:45.484 --> 01:39:46.917
- Catch it, bruv!
- What is it?

01:39:47.044 --> 01:39:49.000
It's the bucky, bruv! Catch it!

01:39:53.644 --> 01:39:54.838
Aaron!

01:39:57.444 --> 01:39:58.843
What the fuck are you doing?

01:39:58.964 --> 01:40:01.637
Bruv, I can't breathe!
She can't breathe neither, man!

01:40:01.764 --> 01:40:03.561
You gotta catch her!

01:40:09.605 --> 01:40:11.561
- Aaron!
- Do it!

01:40:33.605 --> 01:40:35.038
It's OK!

01:41:09.806 --> 01:41:11.364
Ed!

01:41:16.766 --> 01:41:18.518
Ed!

01:41:33.207 --> 01:41:35.516
Oi, Aaron, you've gotta go!
The gun! Aaron!

01:42:36.888 --> 01:42:38.480
Who else knows about this?

01:42:40.008 --> 01:42:41.361
No one.

01:42:42.048 --> 01:42:43.925
What do you mean no one?
What about Ed?

01:42:44.448 --> 01:42:45.801
He's dead.

01:42:45.928 --> 01:42:48.442
What the fuck do you mean Ed's dead?
How did he die?

01:42:48.568 --> 01:42:50.877
Don't worry how he fucking died, bruv.

01:42:52.048 --> 01:42:53.766
Just know that he died...

01:42:55.048 --> 01:42:56.721
..getting you this.

01:43:01.929 --> 01:43:04.841
Bruv, where the fuck are you going, man?
Shut the door.

01:43:14.889 --> 01:43:16.766
Come work for me then, innit?

01:43:21.409 --> 01:43:23.206
I'll bell you tomorrow.

01:46:59.014 --> 01:47:01.574
Take this, innit, for the funeral.

01:47:01.734 --> 01:47:03.691
They might not let you
cos you ain't family.

01:47:03.692 --> 01:47:05.647
Tell them you're his
sister or something.

01:47:05.774 --> 01:47:07.048
Yeah, course.

01:47:14.775 --> 01:47:16.049
Oi!

01:47:17.415 --> 01:47:20.566
What flowers do you reckon
he'd have liked? In the hearse and that?

01:47:22.735 --> 01:47:24.646
Don't know. Anything that you choose.

01:47:26.535 --> 01:47:29.003
White roses are nice, innit?

01:47:31.615 --> 01:47:32.889
Yeah.

01:47:55.255 --> 01:47:56.484
Where's he goin' then?

01:48:01.416 --> 01:48:03.168
Are you fucking stupid or somethin'?

01:48:06.376 --> 01:48:08.936
Fuck you then! Fuck you!

01:48:11.216 --> 01:48:12.854
Pussy!

01:48:40.657 --> 01:48:44.366
# Follow me as I descend
Into madness with gladness

01:48:44.497 --> 01:48:47.091
# For years I've been surrounded
By this badness

01:48:47.217 --> 01:48:48.616
# No time to waste

01:48:48.737 --> 01:48:51.490
# It's high time I escaped
Out of the forest's gate

01:48:51.617 --> 01:48:54.131
# Sorry, mate, but these ends
Are in a sorry state

01:48:54.257 --> 01:48:57.488
# You can't relate? Yeah, well,
you can fuck off can't ya, mate?

01:48:57.617 --> 01:49:00.654
# Your heart is faint
Can't appreciate how this artist paints

01:49:00.777 --> 01:49:02.176
# My art is great

01:49:02.297 --> 01:49:04.413
# It's my mind that's
in the darkest place

01:49:04.537 --> 01:49:07.609
# I can't erase the memories
I have of darker days

01:49:07.737 --> 01:49:09.455
# Darker days

01:49:09.577 --> 01:49:11.249
# That left a bitter aftertaste

01:49:11.377 --> 01:49:14.494
# I'm passed the stage
Of trying hard to mask this rage

01:49:14.617 --> 01:49:16.892
# I'm letting go, callin' out to God

01:49:17.017 --> 01:49:19.406
# To let him know
I'm fallin' on my own accord

01:49:19.537 --> 01:49:21.335
# Please don't attempt to save my soul

01:49:21.458 --> 01:49:22.857
# Get up off the ground

01:49:22.978 --> 01:49:24.457
# Take a look around

01:49:24.578 --> 01:49:27.854
# Dust yourself off
That's when they knock you back down

01:49:27.978 --> 01:49:31.653
# You get up off the ground
Take a look around

01:49:31.778 --> 01:49:34.770
# Dust yourself off
That's when they knock you back down

01:49:34.898 --> 01:49:38.413
# You get up off the ground
Take a look around

01:49:38.538 --> 01:49:41.735
# Dust yourself off
That's when they knock you back down

01:49:41.858 --> 01:49:44.930
# You get up off the ground
Take a look around

01:49:45.058 --> 01:49:48.494
# Dust yourself off
That's when they knock you back down

01:49:48.618 --> 01:49:50.176
# No backpack

01:49:50.298 --> 01:49:51.890
# Just a tramp making tracks

01:49:52.018 --> 01:49:53.292
# I'm cool like Keith

01:49:53.778 --> 01:49:55.575
# Making friends with the rats

01:49:55.738 --> 01:49:58.969
# Observing how they act
They ain't beggin' for my scraps

01:49:59.098 --> 01:50:00.531
# They ain't cats

01:50:00.658 --> 01:50:03.890
# They'd rather wait Until I've
turned my back, no turnin' back

01:50:04.019 --> 01:50:07.648
# Maybe now's the time
To turn to crack I've learnt the facts

01:50:07.779 --> 01:50:09.417
# Way before I learned to rap

01:50:09.539 --> 01:50:10.767
# This place is mess

01:50:10.899 --> 01:50:14.130
# The people here they don't pray success
They hate it, yes

01:50:14.259 --> 01:50:17.888
# They don't want you to progress
That's why they test

01:50:18.019 --> 01:50:19.611
# Try to knock you to the ground

01:50:19.739 --> 01:50:22.537
# You pick yourself up
That's when they knock you back down

01:50:22.659 --> 01:50:26.208
# The university of lifeblood
That's where I got my schooling

01:50:26.339 --> 01:50:29.888
# I know that they can't knock me down
As long as I keep falling

01:50:30.019 --> 01:50:33.250
# You get up off the ground
Take a look around...

01:50:34.459 --> 01:50:36.609
- Are you the owner of this vehicle?
- Yeah.

01:50:36.739 --> 01:50:40.209
# You get up off the ground
Take a look around

01:50:40.339 --> 01:50:43.456
# Dust yourself off
That's when they knock you back down

01:50:43.579 --> 01:50:47.334
# You get up off the ground
Take a look around

01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:50.736
# Dust yourself off
That's when they knock you back down...

01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:52.276
- Bored today, gov?

01:50:52.277 --> 01:50:53.732
- I'm not bored.
It's just a routine check.

01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:55.851
But you lot stopped me for no reason.

01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:58.574
Well, not sure if you knew
you had a low tyre there.

01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:00.651
How can you see my front tyre
from the back?

01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:05.413
Hope.

01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:08.577
# I'm falling down

01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:12.618
# I'm falling down...

01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:16.050
- I've got good eyesight.
- It's cool. There's nothing in there.

01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:18.057
- What's your name, anyway?
- PC Madeira.

01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:21.934
- Do you like wearing that uniform?
- What's this, Chris?

01:51:31.021 --> 01:51:36.379
# I'm falling down

01:51:37.381 --> 01:51:43.650
# I'm falling down

01:51:44.221 --> 01:51:49.215
# I'm falling down

01:51:52.421 --> 01:51:56.619
# Down

01:51:57.741 --> 01:52:03.577
# I'm falling down

01:52:04.581 --> 01:52:10.497
# I'm falling down

01:52:11.461 --> 01:52:16.172
# I'm falling down

01:52:16.302 --> 01:52:20.181
# Dust yourself off
That's when they knock you back down

01:52:43.062 --> 01:52:47.260
# Let's all go on an urban safari
We might see some illegal migrants

01:52:47.382 --> 01:52:50.340
# Oi, look, there's a chav
That means council housed and violent

01:52:50.462 --> 01:52:52.054
# He's got a hoodie on
Give him a hug

01:52:52.182 --> 01:52:53.854
# On second thoughts don't
You don't wanna get mugged

01:52:53.982 --> 01:52:57.259
# Oh, shit, too late that was kinda dumb
Whose idea was that... stupid

01:52:57.383 --> 01:52:59.294
# He's got some front
Ain't we all

01:52:59.423 --> 01:53:01.095
# Be the joker Play the fool

01:53:01.223 --> 01:53:04.579
# What's politics? Ain't it all
smoke and mirrors, April fools?

01:53:04.743 --> 01:53:08.053
