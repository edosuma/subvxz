WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:02.503
BERLUTI: Previously
on The Practice.

00:02.536 --> 00:04.470
FRUTT: Are you trying
to get disbarred?

00:04.505 --> 00:05.539
As self-destructive as--

00:05.572 --> 00:07.674
All right, all right,
on that note.

00:07.708 --> 00:08.709
We've decided to let you go.

00:08.742 --> 00:09.475
Go where?

00:09.510 --> 00:10.577
YOUNG: Here's a check

00:10.611 --> 00:12.345
representing two weeks'
severance pay.

00:12.378 --> 00:15.181
I've generated fees
in excess of $6 million.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.250
You've handed me a check
for $15,000.

00:17.283 --> 00:19.052
YOUNG: Alan Shore seemed
to know this was coming.

00:19.085 --> 00:20.554
Did you tell him?
Yes.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.288
YOUNG: Your employment here
is terminated.

00:22.322 --> 00:23.724
Wherever you take
your business,

00:23.757 --> 00:26.893
I would urge you again
not to take it to Alan Shore.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.795
It is our belief
that he is unstable.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.063
FRUTT: I can't bear the idea

00:30.096 --> 00:32.031
of going back to work
with you not being there.

00:32.064 --> 00:34.000
SHORE: I need to be able
to bring Tara back.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.269
My presence is so powerful,

00:36.302 --> 00:37.738
I don't even have to talk.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.673
Sometimes I'm better
when I don't talk.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.807
This was my thinking.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.408
I'm Denny Crane, damn it.

00:42.442 --> 00:43.143
You hired him.

00:43.176 --> 00:44.177
Why didn't you stop me?

00:44.210 --> 00:46.346
You need to argue this motion.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.515
GLEASON: I'm scheduling
an evidentiary hearing

00:48.549 --> 00:49.415
for next week.

00:49.449 --> 00:50.751
We'll take off our gloves

00:50.784 --> 00:52.285
and have at it.

01:00.433 --> 01:01.902
(clears throat)

01:05.471 --> 01:07.440
What's up?

01:07.473 --> 01:08.708
This is Noah Burke.

01:08.742 --> 01:11.211
He'll be representing us
in our labor dispute.

01:11.244 --> 01:12.412
FRUTT: Wow.

01:12.445 --> 01:14.280
So, we are going outside.

01:14.314 --> 01:16.116
Yes.

01:16.149 --> 01:18.284
Just a thought, but shouldn't I
have been included

01:18.318 --> 01:19.920
in that decision?

01:19.953 --> 01:22.155
Well, that's the very issue
we need to talk about.

01:22.188 --> 01:23.790
BURKE: Look, Ms. Frutt, I can
walk you through the legals,

01:23.824 --> 01:25.792
but cutting to the chase,
this thing is close.

01:25.826 --> 01:28.328
I mean, Mr. Shore's
estoppel claims are colorable.

01:28.361 --> 01:29.563
I mean,
we have an associate here

01:29.596 --> 01:31.264
whose financial contributions
grossly exceed

01:31.297 --> 01:32.599
those of the partners.

01:32.633 --> 01:35.536
He's hired an extremely deep
and talented firm.

01:35.569 --> 01:37.137
I mean, we're in--we're in
for a fight here,

01:37.170 --> 01:38.572
a difficult fight.
So, all this really

01:38.605 --> 01:41.074
is to preface one question,
which is,

01:41.107 --> 01:42.709
"Where do you stand?"

01:42.743 --> 01:45.078
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

01:45.111 --> 01:46.747
Okay, look
(clears throat)

01:46.780 --> 01:47.914
the guts of our case

01:47.948 --> 01:50.551
will be that Alan Shore
is a bad guy.

01:50.584 --> 01:51.985
Now, you will need
to testify.

01:52.018 --> 01:53.286
You will need to get
in the witness chair

01:53.319 --> 01:55.021
and not only support the idea
that he's a bad guy

01:55.055 --> 01:56.422
but actually sell it.
I mean, see,

01:56.456 --> 01:58.625
this man has a personal
animosity towards Mr. Shore.

01:58.659 --> 02:00.400
I mean, his bias
will be exposed and lanced

02:00.433 --> 02:01.968
like a giant boil.

02:02.002 --> 02:03.403
This man looks like
he hates everybody,

02:03.436 --> 02:05.238
and his emotions will make him
anything but impartial.

02:05.271 --> 02:07.641
The only objective
and fair-minded voice we have--

02:07.674 --> 02:09.810
if we're to have one is you.

02:09.842 --> 02:11.712
All right, once again,

02:11.745 --> 02:12.846
it's you.

02:12.879 --> 02:15.181
So as I told Mr. Young
and Mr. Berluti,

02:15.215 --> 02:16.850
you will have to win
this case for us.

02:16.883 --> 02:19.786
You will have to take
Alan Shore down.

02:19.819 --> 02:20.954
So let me put to you

02:20.987 --> 02:22.355
the great interrogatory
once posed

02:22.388 --> 02:23.657
by the leader
of the free world--

02:23.690 --> 02:25.491
are you with us,

02:25.526 --> 02:29.429
or are you against us?

02:29.462 --> 02:32.398
(music playing)

03:09.676 --> 03:10.977
BILLINGS: Whether or not
we go forward all depends.

03:11.011 --> 03:12.112
Of course
we're going forward.

03:12.145 --> 03:13.179
Not so fast.

03:13.213 --> 03:15.148
Then slow down.

03:15.181 --> 03:16.650
I canceled your 10:00.

03:16.683 --> 03:18.952
I had to tell the beast,
and she's in a mood, so...

03:18.985 --> 03:20.053
Tell her
she looks beautiful

03:20.086 --> 03:21.187
and the meeting
will be rescheduled.

03:21.221 --> 03:22.689
Well, she won't believe
she's beautiful

03:22.723 --> 03:24.224
unless you tell her.
Then tell her I said so.

03:24.257 --> 03:25.291
Goodbye.

03:25.325 --> 03:27.127
Who's the beast?

03:27.160 --> 03:28.261
Sara Lipp,

03:28.294 --> 03:31.965
wicked senior partner
of the east.

03:31.998 --> 03:32.999
Denny Crane.

03:33.033 --> 03:34.735
Yes, I know
you're Denny Crane.

03:34.768 --> 03:36.637
Why do you always
tell me your name?

03:36.670 --> 03:38.772
Is it so you won't forget?

03:38.805 --> 03:40.674
Well, let me tell you
something, soldier.

03:40.707 --> 03:42.475
I've learned from experience
that people can't believe

03:42.509 --> 03:45.512
they're actually in the room
with Denny Crane.

03:45.546 --> 03:46.479
They think
it can't be true,

03:46.513 --> 03:49.249
so I let them know
it is true.

03:49.282 --> 03:50.984
I look them in the eye--

03:51.017 --> 03:52.819
"Denny Crane."

03:52.853 --> 03:56.389
Gives them something
to tell their grandkids.

03:56.422 --> 03:57.991
Denny Crane.

04:02.235 --> 04:05.205
You know, I wanted him
because he knows the judge.

04:05.238 --> 04:07.908
I'm having deep concerns now
that the judge knows him.

04:07.941 --> 04:10.376
Okay, first of all,
he did win the motion last week.

04:10.410 --> 04:12.178
Second, I'll first-chair.
He'll be second.

04:12.212 --> 04:14.648
But he talks aloud.

04:14.681 --> 04:16.048
I'll rein him in.

04:16.082 --> 04:16.783
He's an asset.

04:16.817 --> 04:18.985
We want him at our table.

04:19.019 --> 04:20.620
Trust me.

04:22.589 --> 04:24.324
Denny Crane.

04:28.294 --> 04:30.430
STRINGER: Tara, hey.

04:32.999 --> 04:35.101
What's new?

04:35.134 --> 04:37.504
Don't even ask.

04:37.537 --> 04:38.572
You doing okay?

04:38.605 --> 04:40.273
Yeah.

04:40.306 --> 04:42.308
FRUTT: Tara,
thanks for coming in.

04:42.342 --> 04:44.811
Let's go in my office.

04:49.049 --> 04:50.717
Listen,

04:50.751 --> 04:53.787
Eugene, Jimmy, and I,
we realize

04:53.820 --> 04:56.857
that we put you
in an impossible situation,

04:56.890 --> 04:59.192
asking you to protect
a firm confidence

04:59.225 --> 05:01.301
to the detriment
of a friend.

05:01.334 --> 05:04.871
And we appreciate
that maybe,

05:04.905 --> 05:07.073
we were unfair.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.910
Anyway, we're offering you
your job back.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.513
We consider you
an extremely valued member

05:12.546 --> 05:13.980
of this practice,
and we hope

05:14.014 --> 05:16.216
that you will consider
rejoining us.

05:18.685 --> 05:20.787
You're offering me
my job back?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.122
Yes.

05:26.492 --> 05:27.628
And you're actually sorry

05:27.661 --> 05:31.064
for putting me
in a difficult situation?

05:31.097 --> 05:32.265
Yes.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.368
Is Eugene sorry?

05:37.170 --> 05:38.872
Yes.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.109
Well, could Eugene
apologize in person?

05:46.146 --> 05:48.048
That would help me decide.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.116
He's obviously
under a lot of stress, Tara.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.385
Let's not make--
WILSON: Ellenor,

05:52.418 --> 05:56.122
I have a great respect for you.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.490
And my hope is,
at the conclusion

05:57.524 --> 05:58.892
of all this ugliness,

05:58.925 --> 06:02.536
there will be no erosion
of that respect.

06:02.569 --> 06:06.439
But this isn't about you
being sorry.

06:06.472 --> 06:09.342
This isn't about you valuing me
as a member of your firm.

06:10.511 --> 06:13.647
This is about you getting me
on your side,

06:15.582 --> 06:19.119
securing my testimony
to favor you.

06:19.152 --> 06:21.788
Look, Tara,

06:21.822 --> 06:24.658
you know I care about him.

06:24.691 --> 06:27.260
And, believe it or not,
I also care about you.

06:27.293 --> 06:29.930
You are a young law student

06:29.963 --> 06:33.299
with your entire future
ahead of you.

06:33.333 --> 06:36.436
You need to consider carefully

06:36.469 --> 06:39.606
which side you'd rather be
associated with here.

06:42.242 --> 06:45.145
I have considered that
very carefully.

06:48.014 --> 06:50.684
I'll be testifying
in support of Alan.

07:01.502 --> 07:03.436
I can't underline
enough my reservations

07:03.469 --> 07:04.805
about him being here.

07:04.838 --> 07:08.775
And I can't underline enough
his presence has currency.

07:08.809 --> 07:10.376
I don't like it
when people talk about me

07:10.410 --> 07:12.178
like I'm not in the room.

07:12.212 --> 07:14.447
Last time I checked,
I was in the room.

07:14.480 --> 07:17.350
SHORE: You know, I'm having
a sudden burst of insecurity.

07:17.383 --> 07:19.285
I could use some reassurance.

07:19.319 --> 07:22.889
Could you just say
those two little words

07:22.923 --> 07:25.158
I so long to hear?

07:28.662 --> 07:30.564
Denny Crane.

07:30.597 --> 07:31.832
Thank you.

07:31.865 --> 07:33.534
BURKE: Sorry we're late.
Let's get started.

07:33.567 --> 07:35.168
Um, I'd like to preface
my remarks by saying--

07:35.201 --> 07:37.738
CRANE: Hold on.
Hold on just a minute.

07:37.771 --> 07:39.205
You're not late.

07:39.239 --> 07:42.643
You derive some sort of power
keeping everybody waiting.

07:42.676 --> 07:43.677
We agreed to meet at 2:00.

07:43.710 --> 07:46.079
No, you turn up at 10 past.

07:46.112 --> 07:49.082
Our plan all along was to start
the meeting at a quarter past,

07:49.115 --> 07:52.018
so we're just gonna stand around
for five minutes,

07:52.052 --> 07:54.254
you little gerbil. Why don't you
gnaw on a stick of celery?

07:57.791 --> 07:59.726
Denny Crane.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.836
Look, we are here to take one
last stab at settling this.

08:02.869 --> 08:04.437
We are not waiting
five minutes.

08:04.470 --> 08:06.439
We are not waiting two.

08:06.472 --> 08:07.674
Let's start over.

08:07.708 --> 08:08.474
Please.

08:13.213 --> 08:16.683
I think we can all assume,
should this go to trial,

08:16.717 --> 08:19.385
you'll be vicious,
we'll be vicious,

08:19.419 --> 08:22.623
it'll get publicly nasty,
and everybody will bleed.

08:22.656 --> 08:25.759
The reason for this meeting
is to avoid all the bloodshed.

08:25.792 --> 08:27.561
Obviously, we have a number.

08:27.594 --> 08:28.995
You have a number, I suspect.

08:29.029 --> 08:30.664
Should I give you ours?

08:30.697 --> 08:31.832
Please.

08:31.865 --> 08:33.567
$750,000.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.467
And before you reject it,
that's three times the salary

08:35.501 --> 08:36.803
of the next-ranking associate,

08:36.837 --> 08:39.105
and it's probably $750,000
more than you'd get

08:39.139 --> 08:41.241
if we proceed to court,
given Mr. Shore's conduct.

08:41.274 --> 08:42.743
And what, if I were you,
I'd be most concerned with--

08:42.775 --> 08:44.277
You're not me, Mr. Burke.

08:44.310 --> 08:47.047
Let's not ever make
that mistake.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.282
BURKE: If certain things
in this trial become public,

08:49.315 --> 08:51.417
Mr. Shore may be unemployable
in perpetuity

08:51.451 --> 08:52.719
and perhaps even disbarred.

08:52.753 --> 08:53.620
Denny Crane.

08:53.654 --> 08:54.888
Let me respond by just--

08:54.921 --> 08:56.923
May I, Matthew?

08:56.957 --> 08:59.192
Let's not compare my salary

08:59.225 --> 09:01.301
with that of
the highest-ranking associate.

09:01.334 --> 09:04.638
The whole point here
is I don't compare

09:04.671 --> 09:06.673
with the rank associates
at Young, Frutt, and Berluti.

09:06.707 --> 09:08.942
I, in fact,
out-earn and out-produce

09:08.975 --> 09:10.076
the rank partners--

09:10.110 --> 09:11.044
You're being contentious.

09:11.077 --> 09:11.978
Denny Crane.

09:13.614 --> 09:15.181
(chuckles) Okay,

09:15.215 --> 09:17.283
uh, why don't you
just tell us your number?

09:18.685 --> 09:20.787
$1.9 million.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.288
What?
BILLINGS: Should Mr. Shore

09:22.322 --> 09:23.524
be declared
a de facto partner,

09:23.557 --> 09:26.927
his share this year alone
will be over a million.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.729
And that doesn't even account
for the revenues

09:28.762 --> 09:31.431
generated in the future
by clients he brought in.

09:31.464 --> 09:33.734
Which he then stole.
Denny Crane.

09:33.767 --> 09:36.202
BILLINGS: And what that really
doesn't account for--

09:36.236 --> 09:38.104
you guys were close
to going under.

09:38.138 --> 09:39.272
Not true.

09:39.305 --> 09:40.273
You know what?
You can read the books

09:40.306 --> 09:41.842
just like I can.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.677
If the jury finds
that Alan saved this firm

09:43.710 --> 09:45.311
and we have to allow
for the possibility

09:45.345 --> 09:46.847
of that finding.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.549
We could get five million,

09:48.582 --> 09:49.950
maybe six.

09:49.983 --> 09:53.654
Alan Shore was fired from
his last firm for embezzling.

09:53.687 --> 09:55.856
We hired him out of charity
more than anything else.

09:55.889 --> 09:58.258
SHORE: We seem to be
moving further apart now.

09:58.291 --> 09:59.693
May I finish, please?
SHORE: You may,

09:59.726 --> 10:02.969
but that last remark just pushed
our demand up to 2.5.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.337
Alan--
You know what?

10:04.370 --> 10:06.072
In the absence
of any contract,

10:06.106 --> 10:09.375
I think the only fair thing
is to agree.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.311
I have no right to work
at your firm.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.879
I should walk away,
and I will.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.582
I just want the money
I brought in, $9 million.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.818
Take out overhead,
give me the rest.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.353
$8.9 million,
we can all shake hands.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.625
I think we're going to trial.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.208
Let's be fair, Mr. Shore.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.744
You were fired
from your previous firm

10:43.777 --> 10:44.477
for embezzling.

10:44.511 --> 10:45.712
And I deserved it.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.948
I did not deserve to be fired
from this firm.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.082
Because?

10:49.115 --> 10:51.051
Because I saved them
from going bankrupt,

10:51.084 --> 10:53.820
because I won my cases,
because I look good doing it.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.756
BILLINGS: Did you
ever break any laws?

10:55.789 --> 10:56.890
Break any laws?

10:56.923 --> 10:57.624
Yes.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.325
Did you extort lawyers?

10:59.359 --> 11:01.301
Did you illegally
download records?

11:01.334 --> 11:04.538
Were you privy to deals,
buying off witnesses?

11:04.571 --> 11:05.972
Did you suborn perjury?

11:06.006 --> 11:07.741
Ah, that.

11:07.774 --> 11:08.875
Perhaps.

11:08.909 --> 11:10.076
BILLINGS: Perhaps?

11:10.110 --> 11:12.245
Look, they knew my character
when they hired me.

11:12.278 --> 11:14.380
I never did anything--
hello, Judge.

11:14.414 --> 11:17.083
I never did anything ever
that wasn't in my character.

11:17.117 --> 11:19.019
BILLINGS: Well, Alan, come on.

11:19.052 --> 11:21.087
You could have risked
disbarment with all this.

11:21.121 --> 11:23.524
That would run to
the reputation of the firm.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.125
I was called
before the bar already.

11:25.158 --> 11:27.127
Eugene Young
stood up unsolicited,

11:27.160 --> 11:29.495
called me a just
and honorable man.

11:29.530 --> 11:32.866
But when it was time to split up
all the millions of dollars

11:32.899 --> 11:35.168
I generated,

11:35.201 --> 11:36.837
I was suddenly unworthy.

11:38.371 --> 11:39.172
BILLINGS: Thank you, sir.

11:51.652 --> 11:52.753
This feels dramatic.

11:55.288 --> 11:56.489
You left out the part

11:56.523 --> 11:58.892
where you impersonated
an airline official

11:58.925 --> 12:00.333
from the opposing side

12:00.366 --> 12:01.568
and then settled a case

12:01.602 --> 12:03.436
under that false identity.

12:03.469 --> 12:04.838
Using money
out of my own pocket

12:04.871 --> 12:07.207
to spare the firm
a malpractice suit.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.810
You left out the part
where you hired a lawyer

12:09.843 --> 12:12.178
who believed
God talked to her.

12:12.212 --> 12:14.280
It was never established
he didn't.

12:14.314 --> 12:15.415
YOUNG: You left out the part

12:15.448 --> 12:16.850
that you constantly defied
the partners.

12:16.883 --> 12:17.951
Only when they were wrong,

12:17.984 --> 12:19.452
which, granted,
was most of the time.

12:19.485 --> 12:20.787
Is it just me,

12:20.821 --> 12:23.323
or are all his questions
in statement form?

12:23.356 --> 12:24.490
YOUNG: You left out the part

12:24.525 --> 12:27.293
where you hid a murder weapon
from the police.

12:27.327 --> 12:28.428
SHORE:
Oh, if I were to mention that,

12:28.461 --> 12:30.564
the police would demand
to know where I hid it.

12:30.597 --> 12:32.098
YOUNG: You left out the part
where you took a hooker

12:32.132 --> 12:33.867
to a client's wedding.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.902
The invitation said,
"Significant other."

12:35.936 --> 12:37.070
I thought it would last.

12:37.103 --> 12:38.171
YOUNG: You left out the part

12:38.204 --> 12:40.040
where you secretly installed
video cameras

12:40.073 --> 12:41.742
in a woman's hotel room

12:41.775 --> 12:43.710
and taped her having sex.

12:43.744 --> 12:45.546
SHORE:
For blackmail purposes only.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.649
Okay, that was a lie.

12:48.682 --> 12:50.216
I watch for my own pleasure.

12:52.218 --> 12:55.421
This is all one big source
of amusement for you,

12:55.455 --> 12:56.923
isn't it, Alan?

12:56.957 --> 12:59.259
I'll tell you this, Eugene.

12:59.292 --> 13:01.902
If you take life too seriously,

13:01.935 --> 13:04.871
it ceases to be funny.

13:04.905 --> 13:06.306
I tried to impart that

13:06.339 --> 13:09.009
and other
little wisdoms to you,

13:09.042 --> 13:11.745
which you never took,

13:11.778 --> 13:15.481
but you always
took the money.

13:22.488 --> 13:24.390
BILLINGS: Alan, I don't know
what you're doing.

13:24.424 --> 13:25.992
You say you want to settle,
but I don't think

13:26.026 --> 13:27.393
you know what you want.

13:28.461 --> 13:29.830
Tara,

13:29.863 --> 13:32.265
I plan to keep
your testimony very simple.

13:32.298 --> 13:33.534
Basically,
I want you to establish

13:33.567 --> 13:35.035
that he was open and notorious

13:35.068 --> 13:36.302
with his antics
from the beginning.

13:36.336 --> 13:37.504
Okay.

13:37.538 --> 13:38.739
I will not put you
in the position

13:38.772 --> 13:41.474
of attacking Eugene or Ellenor,
and I don't want you to.

13:41.508 --> 13:43.510
Denny, this is Tara Wilson,

13:43.544 --> 13:45.245
a law student I spoke of.

13:45.278 --> 13:46.513
In need of employment?

13:46.547 --> 13:48.281
Yes. She's extremely talented.

13:48.314 --> 13:51.284
I can personally vouch
for her skills as a paralegal,

13:51.317 --> 13:52.619
as well as--
Stand up, please.

13:56.289 --> 13:57.257
Turn around, please.

14:08.208 --> 14:09.910
Lips real?

14:09.943 --> 14:10.911
Yes.

14:10.944 --> 14:12.212
Yours?

14:12.245 --> 14:13.413
CRANE: Let me tell you
something, Tara.

14:13.446 --> 14:16.850
We hire only pretty people
in this firm.

14:16.883 --> 14:18.785
Pretty people
get better results.

14:18.819 --> 14:20.220
Pretty girls
keep me aroused.

14:20.253 --> 14:21.855
I think more clearly
when I'm aroused.

14:21.888 --> 14:23.557
Are you a pretty girl,
soldier?

14:28.629 --> 14:30.564
I am, sir.

14:30.597 --> 14:32.599
Good girl.

14:32.633 --> 14:34.167
At ease.

14:37.103 --> 14:39.740
I'm always at ease,

14:41.207 --> 14:42.075
sir.

14:44.911 --> 14:46.079
I like her.

14:49.950 --> 14:51.451
The truth is

14:51.484 --> 14:54.187
it's been a horrible year.

14:54.220 --> 14:57.691
I haven't liked going to work
since he's been there.

14:57.724 --> 14:59.626
My cases...

14:59.660 --> 15:02.969
seems he's gotten
all the good ones.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.470
How's your love life?

15:06.039 --> 15:06.807
(scoffs)

15:09.976 --> 15:12.145
Sounds like I hate my life,
doesn't it?

15:13.246 --> 15:16.683
Very much so.

15:16.717 --> 15:18.018
Why don't you change it?

15:20.887 --> 15:22.556
How?

15:22.589 --> 15:24.390
Well, what do you want to do?

15:27.127 --> 15:28.595
Jimmy,

15:28.629 --> 15:31.497
you mean you haven't even asked
yourself the question?

15:37.103 --> 15:38.471
WILSON: Dishonorable?

15:38.505 --> 15:39.773
No.

15:39.806 --> 15:42.108
Ethically challenged?

15:42.142 --> 15:44.177
(sighs) Perhaps.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.946
BILLINGS: What's the difference?

15:45.979 --> 15:47.480
WILSON: He was honest
with how he dealt

15:47.514 --> 15:51.317
with his friends
and his fellow partners.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.620
Where he was perhaps underhanded

15:53.654 --> 15:55.689
was with opposing counsel.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.691
Did the partners
at the firm

15:57.724 --> 15:59.793
know about
his underhandedness?

15:59.826 --> 16:02.202
(chuckles) Yes.

16:02.235 --> 16:05.105
They would often protest
and threaten him,

16:05.138 --> 16:07.307
but as Alan
correctly points out,

16:07.340 --> 16:08.441
at the end of the day,

16:08.474 --> 16:10.143
they would cash the checks.

16:10.176 --> 16:12.513
BILLINGS: And Ms. Wilson,
you had the opportunity

16:12.546 --> 16:15.682
to see the financial records
at Young, Frutt, and Berluti?

16:15.716 --> 16:16.817
I did.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.451
BILLINGS: And what kind
of impact did Alan Shore

16:18.484 --> 16:19.753
have on their business?

16:19.786 --> 16:22.255
WILSON: In dollars?

16:22.288 --> 16:24.124
He more than tripled it.

16:27.427 --> 16:29.630
BURKE: Obviously,
you're friends with Alan Shore.

16:29.663 --> 16:31.565
I consider him a friend, yes.

16:31.598 --> 16:33.567
Forgive my indiscretion,

16:33.600 --> 16:35.869
and admittedly, I'm speculating,

16:35.902 --> 16:38.338
but have you had sex with him?

16:38.371 --> 16:39.172
No.

16:39.205 --> 16:40.340
SHORE: Objection.

16:40.373 --> 16:41.875
She answered the question.

16:41.908 --> 16:43.143
That's what I'm objecting to.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.712
I want to have sex with her.
She keeps saying no.

16:47.013 --> 16:49.349
BURKE: I believe
you've witnessed Mr. Shore

16:49.382 --> 16:50.483
committing acts
of sexual harassment

16:50.517 --> 16:52.185
in the workplace,
have you not?

16:52.218 --> 16:53.319
I have.

16:53.353 --> 16:55.856
In fact, you once complained
to Eugene Young

16:55.889 --> 16:58.992
that he repulsed you,
that you thought he was vulgar.

16:59.025 --> 17:02.202
SHORE: I believe the witness
said she had vulgar thoughts

17:02.235 --> 17:03.003
that involved me.

17:03.036 --> 17:04.538
There's a difference there.

17:04.570 --> 17:06.039
Please rephrase.

17:07.272 --> 17:09.843
WILSON: As you can see,
his behavior is quite

17:09.876 --> 17:10.777
incorrigible but I--

17:10.810 --> 17:11.978
BURKE: Incorrigible?

17:12.012 --> 17:15.682
He lies, he steals,
he conceals evidence,

17:15.715 --> 17:19.051
he openly defies the partners,
and that's the word you use

17:19.085 --> 17:20.521
"incorrigible"?

17:20.554 --> 17:21.722
Well--
BURKE: I'm just curious.

17:21.755 --> 17:25.290
Is Mr. Shore helping you
to find new employment?

17:25.325 --> 17:27.928
Actually, he just helped me
find a new job, yes.

17:27.961 --> 17:29.362
BURKE: Oh, well,
that's interesting.

17:29.395 --> 17:31.765
So, I mean, might you say
you're in his debt a little?

17:31.798 --> 17:33.199
I would.

17:33.233 --> 17:35.268
Thank you very much,
Ms. Wilson.

17:38.404 --> 17:41.107
Isn't it true you really
do want to sleep with...

17:43.343 --> 17:44.845
Nothing further.

17:49.683 --> 17:52.819
CRANE: I mean, Matthew,

17:54.487 --> 17:55.989
the client confuses me.

17:57.423 --> 17:58.592
Does he want to lose?

17:58.625 --> 18:02.002
No, he, uh--he just--

18:02.035 --> 18:04.805
he can't contain
himself sometimes.

18:05.438 --> 18:06.406
He's a complicated guy.

18:06.439 --> 18:08.441
This is not good behavior.

18:08.474 --> 18:11.411
This is not consistent
with someone who wants to win.

18:11.444 --> 18:12.212
I understand.

18:12.245 --> 18:14.715
I'm concerned, Matthew.

18:14.748 --> 18:17.618
The client confuses me.

18:19.285 --> 18:21.154
He called me fat.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.556
Mr. Shore did?

18:22.589 --> 18:24.825
BERLUTI: Almost every day.

18:24.858 --> 18:26.492
Usually in front
of other people,

18:26.527 --> 18:29.796
to humiliate me.

18:29.830 --> 18:33.066
It was some remark
about my body,

18:33.099 --> 18:35.502
or he'd also call me stupid.

18:35.536 --> 18:40.140
This is an associate
directing insults at partners,

18:40.173 --> 18:43.176
and he's all shocked
that we didn't want him.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.011
So that's why you voted
to discharge him,

18:45.045 --> 18:46.312
because of all the insults?

18:46.346 --> 18:48.749
No, that's not
the only reason.

18:48.782 --> 18:51.117
He violated legal ethics.

18:51.151 --> 18:53.453
He ignored privilege.

18:58.559 --> 18:59.893
I voted to discharge him

18:59.926 --> 19:04.571
because we're not just
a place of business.

19:04.605 --> 19:06.673
We're not simply
a corporate entity

19:06.707 --> 19:10.176
that exists
to generate profits.

19:11.444 --> 19:14.147
We're a practice at law.

19:14.180 --> 19:16.416
The people in our practice

19:16.449 --> 19:19.319
have respect
for the profession,

19:19.352 --> 19:22.388
respect for each other
as people.

19:23.489 --> 19:25.458
He didn't.

19:25.491 --> 19:28.328
I voted to discharge him
because it is not okay

19:28.361 --> 19:31.932
to ignore the ethical rules
of the practice.

19:31.965 --> 19:34.901
I voted to discharge him
because it is not okay

19:34.935 --> 19:37.437
to be little people,

19:37.470 --> 19:40.674
to treat them
with cruelty or ridicule.

19:41.742 --> 19:42.909
If he wants to build a firm

19:42.943 --> 19:45.078
where that kind
of behavior is okay,

19:45.111 --> 19:47.147
let him build his own firm,

19:47.180 --> 19:50.651
but he was an associate
at ours,

19:50.684 --> 19:52.753
and he dishonored it,

19:52.786 --> 19:55.488
and us, daily.

19:59.660 --> 20:01.067
Thank you, sir.

20:29.029 --> 20:31.932
You spoke with a great deal
of emotion, Jimmy.

20:36.537 --> 20:38.672
You don't like me, do you?

20:40.140 --> 20:43.276
No, I don't.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.913
Is it possible for you
to completely separate

20:46.947 --> 20:48.281
your personal dislike of me

20:48.314 --> 20:49.683
from your objective
opinion of me

20:49.716 --> 20:51.852
as an attorney,

20:51.885 --> 20:53.286
honestly?

20:55.388 --> 20:57.057
Probably not.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.134
Thank you.

21:05.672 --> 21:07.941
(music playing)

21:42.475 --> 21:45.612
Are you testifying
against me, Ellenor?

21:45.646 --> 21:48.849
Alan, what do you want?

21:48.882 --> 21:52.152
The jury can't order us
to rehire you.

21:52.185 --> 21:55.656
You claim
it's not about the money.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.490
So...

21:57.524 --> 21:59.726
what is it
that you want?

22:01.067 --> 22:02.669
I don't know.

22:06.339 --> 22:08.909
Maybe just to be--

22:15.982 --> 22:18.018
well, let's leave it
at that.

22:18.051 --> 22:19.553
Just to be.

22:24.658 --> 22:26.326
Are you trying
to get the jury

22:26.359 --> 22:27.994
to judge you negatively

22:28.028 --> 22:29.095
to confirm
some twisted--

22:29.129 --> 22:31.998
SHORE: Aw, I got
another psychoanalysis.

22:32.032 --> 22:33.834
I don't have time, Ellenor.

22:34.968 --> 22:37.237
I've got a long day
in court tomorrow.

22:43.544 --> 22:45.011
Do you?

23:02.569 --> 23:03.837
YOUNG:
He had no contract.

23:03.870 --> 23:05.405
It was employee
at will,

23:05.438 --> 23:07.641
and legally,
we're entitled

23:07.674 --> 23:08.842
to terminate an associate

23:08.875 --> 23:10.010
for personal reasons.

23:10.043 --> 23:12.913
But it wasn't just
personal reasons.

23:12.946 --> 23:14.515
We had to protect
the integrity

23:14.548 --> 23:15.448
of our practice.

23:15.481 --> 23:16.717
BURKE: But, Eugene,

23:16.750 --> 23:18.151
as it's been said,

23:18.184 --> 23:19.285
you did take the money.

23:19.319 --> 23:22.556
Yes, he earned revenue
in his capacity

23:22.589 --> 23:23.456
as an associate,

23:23.489 --> 23:25.091
but that didn't give him tenure.

23:25.125 --> 23:27.628
You heard all the things
he did against the law,

23:27.661 --> 23:28.895
against the canons of law,

23:28.929 --> 23:30.564
against us.

23:30.597 --> 23:32.365
How do we employ a person

23:32.398 --> 23:33.767
we can't even trust?

23:33.800 --> 23:36.336
Fiduciary duty,
that has to mean something

23:36.369 --> 23:37.671
in a partnership--

23:37.704 --> 23:39.339
is an implied obligation

23:39.372 --> 23:41.474
to deal fairly
with one another,

23:41.508 --> 23:42.442
honestly.

23:42.475 --> 23:44.645
That man never did.

23:44.678 --> 23:47.180
As a result, he had to go.

23:49.082 --> 23:50.517
He had to go.

23:51.885 --> 23:53.086
BURKE: Thank you.

24:05.739 --> 24:07.674
I want you to know I agree
with everything you said,

24:07.708 --> 24:09.409
and if what you said
about my client is true,

24:09.442 --> 24:11.377
I'd have fired
his ass, too.

24:11.411 --> 24:12.412
Good work, soldier.

24:12.445 --> 24:13.747
Nothing further.

24:20.286 --> 24:21.622
Uh...

24:23.489 --> 24:26.092
I imagine this, uh,

24:26.126 --> 24:27.928
business about fiduciary duty--

24:27.961 --> 24:30.363
obligation to deal fairly,
honestly--

24:30.396 --> 24:31.865
goes both ways.

24:31.898 --> 24:33.934
You would have a duty

24:33.967 --> 24:35.969
to be fair

24:36.002 --> 24:38.939
and aboveboard
with Alan Shore.

24:38.972 --> 24:40.807
I would, and I did.

24:40.841 --> 24:42.208
Good man.

24:49.816 --> 24:51.652
Uh, you had a meeting

24:51.685 --> 24:54.320
with, uh, Samuel Gould,

24:54.354 --> 24:56.456
a client of Al Shore's,

24:56.489 --> 24:57.891
last week, did you not?

24:57.924 --> 24:59.392
I did.

24:59.425 --> 25:01.702
CRANE: Longtime client
of Al Shore's, am I right?

25:01.735 --> 25:02.536
Yes.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.909
(over recorder)
That must strongly caution you

25:08.942 --> 25:11.645
against going with Alan Shore.
GOULD (over recorder): Why?

25:11.678 --> 25:12.513
YOUNG (over recorder):
It is our belief

25:12.546 --> 25:13.614
that he is unstable,

25:13.647 --> 25:15.181
that he has self-destructive

25:15.215 --> 25:16.717
personality tendencies,

25:16.750 --> 25:19.520
that he's also prone
to committing unethical,

25:19.553 --> 25:21.321
sometimes even criminal acts.

25:21.354 --> 25:23.056
Wherever you take
your business,

25:23.089 --> 25:24.390
I would urge you again

25:24.424 --> 25:27.027
not to take it to Alan Shore.

25:27.060 --> 25:28.094
(click)

25:28.128 --> 25:29.663
That was you

25:29.696 --> 25:32.733
trying to steal
Al Shore's client.

25:32.766 --> 25:35.368
Was that a fiduciary stab
in Al's back?

25:35.401 --> 25:37.337
At the time
of that discussion,

25:37.370 --> 25:39.706
Samuel Gould
was a client of the firm.

25:39.740 --> 25:41.441
Your Honor, it's illegal
to secretly tape-record--

25:41.474 --> 25:42.843
CRANE: There was nothing
secret about it.

25:42.876 --> 25:44.611
Mr. Gould taped all
his meetings.

25:44.645 --> 25:45.812
The firm knew it.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.015
Did you forget?

25:49.049 --> 25:50.551
(clicks)

25:50.584 --> 25:51.451
YOUNG (over recorder):
He is unstable,

25:51.484 --> 25:53.453
that he has self-destructive

25:53.486 --> 25:54.955
personality tendencies.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.657
(clicks)

25:56.690 --> 25:58.424
That's slander, Mr. Young.

25:58.458 --> 26:00.534
Truth is a complete defense

26:00.567 --> 26:02.503
to slander.

26:02.536 --> 26:04.470
I spoke the truth.

26:10.677 --> 26:12.012
You know, son,
I'm a senior partner

26:12.045 --> 26:13.747
in my firm the way
you are in yours.

26:13.780 --> 26:16.583
And here's the thing
about good leadership--

26:16.617 --> 26:18.985
and you tell me
if you disagree.

26:19.019 --> 26:21.788
It's not enough
to insist on fidelity

26:21.822 --> 26:25.091
or honesty or fair dealing.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.727
A good leader

26:26.760 --> 26:28.995
has to practice it.

26:32.566 --> 26:34.500
Denny Crane.

26:42.676 --> 26:43.777
SHORE: Was it my imagination,

26:43.810 --> 26:46.012
or was he actually
quite effective?

26:46.046 --> 26:47.280
I keep telling you,

26:47.313 --> 26:48.448
once he's in a courtroom,

26:48.481 --> 26:49.683
all the plaque on his brain

26:49.716 --> 26:51.217
just dissolves.

26:51.251 --> 26:53.119
I don't know
what the hell it is,

26:53.153 --> 26:54.888
but I think
it was effective.

26:54.921 --> 26:56.422
I don't like it
when people talk about me

26:56.456 --> 26:57.824
like I'm not in the corridor.

26:57.858 --> 26:59.192
Last time I checked,

26:59.225 --> 27:00.734
I was in the corridor.

27:02.335 --> 27:05.271
(music playing)

27:16.717 --> 27:18.284
FRUTT: He said
that he had been fired

27:18.318 --> 27:19.452
by his firm

27:19.485 --> 27:21.722
and that he needed
a break.

27:21.755 --> 27:23.624
Did he say
why he was fired?

27:23.657 --> 27:25.859
He embezzled.

27:25.892 --> 27:27.260
He said
it was a half-Robin Hood

27:27.293 --> 27:28.061
kind of thing,

27:28.094 --> 27:29.429
that he took from the rich

27:29.462 --> 27:30.964
and kept it.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.198
BURKE: And knowing this,

27:32.232 --> 27:34.134
you hired Alan Shore?

27:34.167 --> 27:36.002
Yes.

27:36.036 --> 27:36.737
BURKE: Why?

27:36.770 --> 27:39.305
He was a friend who--

27:41.908 --> 27:42.809
well, like you said,

27:42.843 --> 27:45.045
he needed a break.

27:45.078 --> 27:48.014
And this testimony today...

27:49.082 --> 27:51.017
this is difficult?

27:51.051 --> 27:52.853
You have no idea.

27:52.886 --> 27:55.589
BURKE: In fact,
despite all the infractions

27:55.622 --> 27:57.290
he's committed
since joining your firm,

27:57.323 --> 27:58.725
you've continued
to defend him.

28:00.867 --> 28:02.769
Why, Ellenor?

28:04.638 --> 28:06.372
I think Alan

28:07.808 --> 28:09.710
is deeply troubled.

28:09.743 --> 28:11.177
As talented as he is,

28:11.211 --> 28:13.980
as terrific as he is,

28:15.348 --> 28:17.951
I don't think
he likes himself.

28:17.984 --> 28:20.554
And on some
psychological level--

28:20.587 --> 28:22.523
BILLINGS: Objection--
foundation.

28:22.556 --> 28:23.857
This will be a lay opinion

28:23.890 --> 28:25.592
from a friend, Your Honor.

28:25.626 --> 28:26.660
I'll allow it.

28:28.161 --> 28:30.196
BURKE: Please continue.

28:30.230 --> 28:33.166
I think to service
his own self-loathing,

28:33.199 --> 28:36.236
he breeds contempt
from others.

28:36.269 --> 28:37.170
BURKE: We heard

28:37.203 --> 28:38.705
Eugene Young use the words

28:38.739 --> 28:39.940
"self-destructive."

28:39.973 --> 28:41.808
FRUTT: That would be fair.

28:41.842 --> 28:42.643
I've said that to Alan

28:42.676 --> 28:44.444
on more than one occasion.

28:45.746 --> 28:47.614
I truly believe

28:47.648 --> 28:51.217
he's trying
to destroy himself.

28:51.251 --> 28:53.887
I don't think it was ever

28:53.920 --> 28:55.989
his intent

28:56.022 --> 28:58.992
to damage the firm,

28:59.025 --> 29:01.267
but that's what
he started to do.

29:01.301 --> 29:03.136
So, you agree, then,

29:03.169 --> 29:05.371
with the decision
to discharge him?

29:07.641 --> 29:09.843
I do.

29:09.876 --> 29:12.078
BURKE: Thank you, Ellenor.

29:18.351 --> 29:20.153
You really wanna do
this one?

29:22.689 --> 29:25.025
Alan?

29:25.058 --> 29:26.059
SHORE: Yeah.

29:39.372 --> 29:41.174
You think it's best
that I leave.

29:48.148 --> 29:50.116
Did you not say last week,

29:50.150 --> 29:52.686
"Let's work this out"?

29:52.719 --> 29:56.557
Did you not say
you couldn't bear the idea

29:56.590 --> 29:57.390
of going to work

29:57.423 --> 29:59.926
at a place without me?

30:01.902 --> 30:03.303
I said that.

30:04.538 --> 30:05.906
Did you mean it?

30:05.939 --> 30:08.008
I meant it.

30:10.343 --> 30:13.046
But, Alan,

30:13.079 --> 30:15.215
I said that
un-objectively,

30:15.248 --> 30:16.950
as your friend,

30:16.983 --> 30:18.351
as a person who continues

30:18.384 --> 30:21.054
to care deeply for you,

30:22.656 --> 30:23.657
but...

30:23.690 --> 30:25.626
(breathes)

30:27.360 --> 30:30.430
I don't think
you're entirely well.

30:30.463 --> 30:33.133
You are gonna
self-destruct one day,

30:34.968 --> 30:37.170
and I can't prevent that.

30:38.739 --> 30:40.240
But I can't let you

30:40.273 --> 30:43.409
destroy my partners
in the process.

30:43.443 --> 30:45.378
(sighs)

30:46.947 --> 30:48.381
I'm sorry.

30:53.854 --> 30:55.088
I see.

30:58.024 --> 31:00.967
(music playing)

31:18.218 --> 31:20.053
YOUNG: We live in a time

31:20.086 --> 31:21.588
where breaking rules,

31:21.622 --> 31:22.823
being a rebel,

31:22.856 --> 31:23.857
flashing irreverence

31:23.890 --> 31:25.826
for any kind
of convention is cool,

31:25.859 --> 31:26.760
is hip.

31:26.793 --> 31:29.663
Alan Shore is a hip,
cool guy.

31:29.696 --> 31:31.064
He's entertaining, too.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.332
It can be fun

31:32.365 --> 31:34.200
watching him do his thing,

31:34.234 --> 31:35.736
but when he's doing it to you

31:35.769 --> 31:36.703
or people you love

31:36.737 --> 31:38.138
or something you love--

31:41.141 --> 31:43.977
you see
these people here?

31:44.010 --> 31:45.946
We don't have
husbands and wives.

31:45.979 --> 31:47.714
Ellenor has a child,

31:47.748 --> 31:48.448
I have a son,

31:48.481 --> 31:49.750
but no one can accuse us

31:49.783 --> 31:52.018
of living rounded,
balanced lives.

31:52.052 --> 31:54.254
Our lives are that law firm.

31:54.287 --> 31:56.156
Our lives
are each other,

31:56.189 --> 31:58.759
and working together
in a place--

31:58.792 --> 32:00.767
together--

32:00.801 --> 32:02.135
that's something.

32:08.775 --> 32:11.111
I might even
call that "everything."

32:13.413 --> 32:15.716
This man

32:15.749 --> 32:17.984
couldn't get that.

32:18.018 --> 32:20.153
He came in,
from the very first day,

32:20.186 --> 32:22.022
and behaved in a way that said,

32:22.055 --> 32:24.525
"People here
don't have to be moral.

32:24.558 --> 32:26.426
People here don't have
to conduct themselves

32:26.459 --> 32:27.293
with integrity,

32:27.327 --> 32:29.095
that people here don't need

32:29.129 --> 32:30.931
to be honest."

32:30.964 --> 32:32.032
You heard the list,

32:32.065 --> 32:33.499
blackmail, extortion,

32:33.534 --> 32:34.500
breaking privilege,

32:34.535 --> 32:36.336
impersonating
opposing parties,

32:36.369 --> 32:37.170
concealing evidence,

32:37.203 --> 32:38.605
It goes on and on.

32:38.639 --> 32:40.874
He did this
acting as an agent

32:40.907 --> 32:43.376
of the place we built.

32:43.409 --> 32:44.778
Alan Shore thinks he got fired

32:44.811 --> 32:45.746
because we were afraid

32:45.779 --> 32:47.047
he'd bring the firm down.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.149
What he can't seem to get

32:49.182 --> 32:50.283
is that he's already

32:50.316 --> 32:52.318
brought us down.

32:54.988 --> 32:56.890
Like I said,

32:56.923 --> 32:59.359
I know scandal
is hip these days.

32:59.392 --> 33:01.935
For sure, it's profitable.

33:01.968 --> 33:04.571
But at Young, Frutt,
and Berluti,

33:04.605 --> 33:06.540
character still counts.

33:06.573 --> 33:07.808
It must count.

33:07.841 --> 33:11.645
Our dignity is not
a fungible thing,

33:11.678 --> 33:13.814
not to Ellenor,

33:13.847 --> 33:15.982
not to Jimmy,

33:16.016 --> 33:17.417
not to Jamie,

33:21.321 --> 33:22.422
not to me.

33:25.726 --> 33:27.060
Alan Shore...

33:29.996 --> 33:31.898
just can't get that.

33:34.100 --> 33:37.070
(music playing)

34:03.403 --> 34:05.872
When this firm hired me,

34:07.207 --> 34:09.309
they knowingly
engaged the services

34:09.342 --> 34:11.545
of an embezzler.

34:11.578 --> 34:13.947
They let me go about my evil,

34:13.980 --> 34:15.649
sinister business,

34:15.681 --> 34:17.350
and make them rich,

34:18.918 --> 34:20.754
and then they tossed me.

34:24.090 --> 34:25.926
I had an uncle.

34:25.958 --> 34:29.161
He'd bring
a delicious dessert

34:29.195 --> 34:31.164
to every family
get-together,

34:31.197 --> 34:33.299
and everyone would fawn

34:33.333 --> 34:35.301
and gush, saying,

34:35.335 --> 34:36.969
"You're so thoughtful, Charles.

34:37.003 --> 34:38.772
You're so generous."

34:40.406 --> 34:42.007
He admitted to me
he wasn't generous at all.

34:42.042 --> 34:43.844
He was hungry.

34:43.877 --> 34:45.946
And his logic was...

34:45.978 --> 34:47.748
if he brought a pie,

34:47.781 --> 34:49.315
he'd get a slice.

34:51.851 --> 34:53.719
I brought the pie,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:53.754 --> 34:55.388
They didn't give me my slice.

34:56.922 --> 34:59.125
And as for all my despicable,

34:59.159 --> 35:01.201
unethical, immoral,

35:01.234 --> 35:03.604
treacherous, sleazy conduct,

35:03.637 --> 35:04.738
they called me everything

35:04.771 --> 35:06.272
but a terrorist, didn't they?

35:06.306 --> 35:08.642
This business

35:08.675 --> 35:12.012
is not an ethical arena.

35:12.045 --> 35:15.516
Our legal system
is adversarial by nature,

35:15.549 --> 35:17.851
where it is often
the very function

35:17.884 --> 35:20.921
of a lawyer's job

35:20.954 --> 35:22.823
to prevent the truth

35:22.856 --> 35:25.692
from ever coming out.

35:25.726 --> 35:29.029
We get paid to suppress

35:29.062 --> 35:30.797
and squash

35:30.831 --> 35:32.733
and conceal evidence.

35:32.766 --> 35:34.668
Remember, this is the system

35:34.701 --> 35:35.969
that freed O. J.

35:36.002 --> 35:38.639
but also convicted
Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.

35:38.672 --> 35:42.509
Every first-year
law student is taught,

35:42.543 --> 35:46.346
"Don't ever,
ever equate legal ethics

35:46.379 --> 35:47.614
with morality.

35:47.648 --> 35:50.416
They're almost always
mutually exclusive."

35:50.450 --> 35:52.218
It's an ugly world

35:52.252 --> 35:55.522
where underhandedness
is often celebrated.

35:55.556 --> 35:57.323
I didn't enter

35:57.357 --> 35:59.660
Eugene Young's church.

35:59.693 --> 36:01.001
It was a law firm.

36:01.034 --> 36:02.235
A criminal law firm.

36:02.268 --> 36:03.570
The dirtiest kind,

36:03.604 --> 36:05.171
where lawyers get up in court,

36:05.205 --> 36:07.708
as Mr. Young has many times,

36:07.741 --> 36:11.144
and knowingly falsely
accuse innocent people

36:11.177 --> 36:12.112
of murder.

36:12.145 --> 36:12.913
Why?

36:12.946 --> 36:13.814
For the noble cause

36:13.847 --> 36:15.549
of getting
the real killer off.

36:15.582 --> 36:18.184
Eugene Young
has put guilty people

36:18.218 --> 36:20.386
back on the street
to kill again.

36:20.420 --> 36:23.289
He's in the business
of freeing serial rapists.

36:23.323 --> 36:26.026
But, hey,
I brought the firm down

36:26.059 --> 36:28.795
by pretending to be
an airline executive.

36:28.829 --> 36:29.930
I'm sorry.

36:29.963 --> 36:31.932
I guess
I just don't get it.

36:34.535 --> 36:35.936
He goes behind my back,

36:35.969 --> 36:38.705
tells my client I'm unstable

36:38.739 --> 36:40.741
for the purpose
of stealing that client.

36:40.774 --> 36:43.209
This somehow falls
within the bounds

36:43.243 --> 36:44.745
of integrity.

36:45.946 --> 36:48.314
I guess
I just don't get it.

36:55.822 --> 36:56.957
There's a couple of things

36:56.990 --> 36:59.793
Eugene Young
just can't seem to get.

36:59.826 --> 37:02.702
First, I'm just
an unscrupulous guy

37:02.736 --> 37:05.872
trying to get by
in an unscrupulous profession.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.041
And second,

37:08.074 --> 37:11.210
I respect him profoundly.

37:11.244 --> 37:14.514
There's perhaps nobody
I respect more.

37:17.050 --> 37:20.486
In the eight or so months
I've known you,

37:21.555 --> 37:22.723
I've found you to be

37:22.756 --> 37:26.326
utterly beyond reproach,

37:32.465 --> 37:35.802
which is why I'm so surprised

37:35.836 --> 37:38.071
he would take all that money

37:38.104 --> 37:39.873
I brought in,

37:39.906 --> 37:42.408
fire me,

37:42.442 --> 37:45.111
then go through all this

37:45.145 --> 37:47.681
just to avoid
giving me my slice.

38:03.069 --> 38:04.204
WILSON: Hey, how'd it go?

38:04.237 --> 38:05.471
SHORE: They're deliberating.

38:05.506 --> 38:06.740
Can we talk
about the outfit?

38:06.773 --> 38:08.108
WILSON: (sighs)

38:08.141 --> 38:11.612
All the assistants here
wear uniforms.

38:11.645 --> 38:12.879
I like it.

38:12.913 --> 38:14.247
Do you?

38:14.280 --> 38:15.015
Well, as soon
as I pass the bar,

38:15.048 --> 38:15.882
it's coming off.

38:15.916 --> 38:16.650
I can't wait.

38:16.683 --> 38:19.052
Let's go to the bar now.

38:19.085 --> 38:20.754
We conduct
our sexual harassment

38:20.787 --> 38:21.988
behind closed doors here,
sailor.

38:22.022 --> 38:23.323
SHORE: I shudder
to think.

38:23.356 --> 38:24.758
Excuse me.
Oh.

38:26.593 --> 38:27.661
CRANE: That was a hell
of a closing.

38:27.694 --> 38:29.730
I like what I see so far.

38:29.763 --> 38:31.898
$9 million, portables,

38:31.932 --> 38:32.866
a closing like that.

38:32.899 --> 38:34.835
What do you say...

38:34.868 --> 38:36.136
we take
our relationship

38:36.169 --> 38:38.171
to the next level?

38:38.204 --> 38:41.274
Are you a homosexual,
Denny?

38:41.307 --> 38:44.778
I'm offering you
a job, sailor.

38:44.811 --> 38:47.180
BILLINGS:
You can't be serious.

38:47.213 --> 38:48.515
They already have a verdict.

38:48.549 --> 38:49.315
SHORE: What?

38:49.349 --> 38:50.383
That means
they never got

38:50.416 --> 38:51.417
to damages.

38:51.451 --> 38:52.886
You lost, pilgrim.

38:52.919 --> 38:53.787
Come on.

39:04.605 --> 39:05.839
It's exciting.

39:08.842 --> 39:10.176
GLEASON: All right.

39:10.210 --> 39:11.277
Mr. Foreman,

39:11.311 --> 39:12.979
the jury has reached a verdict?

39:14.414 --> 39:15.549
We have, Your Honor.

39:15.582 --> 39:17.951
What say you?

39:17.984 --> 39:19.553
FOREMAN: On question one,

39:19.586 --> 39:20.887
"Was the defendant's termination

39:20.921 --> 39:22.222
of the plaintiff wrongful?"

39:22.255 --> 39:24.124
We find in the affirmative.

39:24.157 --> 39:26.192
That means "Yes."

39:26.226 --> 39:26.993
Oh.

39:27.027 --> 39:27.794
FOREMAN: On question two,

39:27.828 --> 39:29.429
concerning damages,

39:29.462 --> 39:30.230
we order the defendant

39:30.263 --> 39:31.231
to pay the plaintiff

39:31.264 --> 39:32.566
compensatory damages

39:32.599 --> 39:34.968
in the amount of $2.3 million.

39:35.001 --> 39:37.938
(music playing)

39:46.547 --> 39:47.614
BILLINGS: Congratulations.

39:47.648 --> 39:48.949
Thank you.

40:09.976 --> 40:11.311
Lost.

40:11.344 --> 40:12.278
$2.3 million.

40:12.312 --> 40:14.180
Two?

40:14.214 --> 40:15.582
We've appealed.

40:15.616 --> 40:16.517
Let's not--
HATCHER: Well,

40:16.550 --> 40:18.218
does this affect payroll?

40:18.251 --> 40:20.086
I mean, can we still
finance our cases?

40:20.120 --> 40:22.488
Do you guys need me
to open up a separate account?

40:22.523 --> 40:24.090
YOUNG: Look, I'll advise you

40:24.124 --> 40:26.359
what to do, Lucy, okay?

40:26.392 --> 40:27.794
Jimmy, Ellenor,

40:27.828 --> 40:29.663
in the conference room, please.

40:36.302 --> 40:37.504
(door closes)

40:42.643 --> 40:44.044
I don't want the money.

40:44.077 --> 40:45.546
If the judgment holds up,

40:45.579 --> 40:47.581
we'll pay you the money.

40:47.614 --> 40:49.049
I don't want it.

40:49.082 --> 40:49.916
Well, you'll get it.

40:49.950 --> 40:51.084
Do with it what you want,

40:51.117 --> 40:52.619
but this firm always meets

40:52.653 --> 40:54.555
its financial obligations.

40:54.588 --> 40:56.523
Maybe we can donate it
to a cause

40:56.557 --> 40:57.758
that we mutually--

40:57.791 --> 40:59.292
legalization of prostitution,

40:59.325 --> 41:01.034
something that--

41:04.037 --> 41:05.138
whatever.

41:06.773 --> 41:08.174
Why are you here?

41:08.208 --> 41:10.511
(chuckles)

41:10.544 --> 41:13.013
I'm here because...

41:15.716 --> 41:16.917
I'm a sucker for closure,

41:16.950 --> 41:18.051
I guess.

41:19.720 --> 41:20.754
Not to be confused

41:20.787 --> 41:23.023
with sentimentality, but...

41:24.725 --> 41:26.527
I wanted you all

41:26.560 --> 41:28.194
to know two things.

41:29.763 --> 41:30.797
First,

41:33.199 --> 41:35.969
I'm sorry

41:36.002 --> 41:39.039
for any embarrassment that--

41:43.143 --> 41:46.479
well, any embarrassment.

41:49.049 --> 41:50.617
And second,

41:56.022 --> 41:58.625
I really loved working here.

42:00.233 --> 42:02.268
I know my coming back

42:02.302 --> 42:04.270
isn't an option,

42:04.304 --> 42:05.238
but...

42:07.541 --> 42:09.142
people should know
where people stand.

42:09.175 --> 42:10.977
I've always believed that.

42:12.045 --> 42:13.213
And...

42:23.389 --> 42:25.526
I loved working here.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.361
I wanted you to know.

42:41.775 --> 42:43.343
(door closes)

42:43.376 --> 42:46.312
(music playing)

42:56.590 --> 42:59.526
(music playing)

43:20.654 --> 43:21.387
BOY: Score, score.

43:21.421 --> 43:22.488
WOMAN: You stinker.

43:24.324 --> 43:27.060
(music playing)
