WEBVTT

01:27.254 --> 01:30.390
Well, hey everyone. This is
Rick.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.595
And I'm making this video,

01:33.628 --> 01:36.496
well, for many reasons, I guess.

01:36.531 --> 01:39.601
I suppose
that the main reason is that

01:39.634 --> 01:43.504
I want there to be some record
of the way that I feel.

01:44.639 --> 01:48.475
My ideas,
just who I was, really.

01:50.477 --> 01:54.247
I met, got to know some
ex-members here and there,

01:54.281 --> 01:57.250
some more than others.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.887
But I wanted to explain
some of the things

01:59.921 --> 02:01.623
that I've been doing
and thinking

02:01.656 --> 02:05.660
and some of the frustrations
that I've had.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.428
Anyway, I don't know,
I guess it's just my...

02:08.963 --> 02:11.164
Sort of my...

02:11.198 --> 02:13.835
Last grasp at immortality.

02:14.368 --> 02:17.371
I know that I'm not immortal,
and I know this video

02:17.404 --> 02:19.674
is not going to make me so.

02:19.707 --> 02:23.443
But at the same time,
I want to...

02:23.477 --> 02:25.278
I want people to know
that even though

02:25.312 --> 02:27.682
some of the things that I'm
gonna do are rather shocking,

02:27.715 --> 02:29.851
and... maybe not right

02:29.884 --> 02:31.953
in a lot of people's books.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.956
I want to explain some
of the reasons behind them.

02:34.989 --> 02:37.892
So anyway, I'm just...

02:37.925 --> 02:40.862
Loading up some of my mags here.

02:40.895 --> 02:42.295
You guys don't mind

02:42.329 --> 02:43.865
if I do that
while I talk, right?

02:43.898 --> 02:45.332
Originally I thought that

02:45.365 --> 02:49.302
I was gonna have
this opportunity in march.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.905
It's early January now.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.573
And I...

02:52.607 --> 02:54.742
I don't know, I guess
I got some bad information,

02:54.776 --> 02:56.711
'cause all of a sudden,
a couple days ago

02:56.744 --> 03:00.815
I heard that the opportunity
was gonna arise.

03:00.848 --> 03:05.352
And I mean, well, this weekend,
which is basically right now.

03:05.385 --> 03:08.221
It's Friday night,
so I was caught off guard.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.489
I wasn't really prepared,

03:09.524 --> 03:13.260
so sort of having to cram.

03:13.293 --> 03:16.229
It's funny,
I always thought that...

03:16.263 --> 03:17.999
You know...

03:18.032 --> 03:19.934
I used to think
a lot about suicide.

03:19.967 --> 03:23.538
It's actually...
Well, believe it or not,

03:23.571 --> 03:25.338
it should have started
a long time ago.

03:25.372 --> 03:29.811
It should have started when
I was fucking born, actually.

03:29.844 --> 03:31.311
But to tell you the truth,

03:31.344 --> 03:32.747
it didn't really start
in earnest

03:32.780 --> 03:36.483
until... the infamous
teen training happened.

03:37.350 --> 03:38.953
Yes, teen training.

03:39.286 --> 03:41.789
Fucking brainwashing.

03:41.823 --> 03:46.527
Man, I started thinking
"wow! How could I do it?"

03:46.561 --> 03:50.565
Well, I was...
I wasn't the oldest.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.667
I was the oldest
for a long time,

03:52.700 --> 03:55.503
but of course,
at teen training there was

03:55.536 --> 03:57.972
a bunch of girls that were
older than I was,

03:58.005 --> 04:00.608
but you know...

04:00.641 --> 04:02.977
Let me tell you, this suicide

04:03.010 --> 04:05.613
was nothing that
you talked about with people.

04:05.646 --> 04:06.948
Anybody.

04:06.981 --> 04:10.317
They'd beat the devil
out of you or whatever.

04:10.350 --> 04:13.821
It's just fucking insane.

04:13.855 --> 04:17.992
But you all
know that, that's old news.

04:18.025 --> 04:22.029
Anyway, that's when I started
thinking about suicide.

04:22.063 --> 04:26.634
I was thinking, well, you know
what kind of poisons there are.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.804
Poisons, you know, are easy,
or so I thought.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.673
I've learned since then
if you wanna take poisons

04:32.707 --> 04:36.711
and you wanna make sure,
or at least reasonably sure

04:36.744 --> 04:38.378
that it's gonna work,

04:38.411 --> 04:42.482
it's good to take some
dramamine beforehand.

04:42.517 --> 04:46.020
It settles your stomach
so you don't barf it up.

04:46.053 --> 04:49.724
Anyway, I didn't know
about that then.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.727
I thought about...
Drinking chlorine,

04:52.760 --> 04:55.428
which of course is ridiculous.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.732
I thought of, you know,

04:57.765 --> 05:00.067
maybe I'd heard of,
like, lead poisoning,

05:00.101 --> 05:01.502
you know, I thought...

05:01.536 --> 05:04.539
Or maybe I could, like,
jab a pencil

05:04.572 --> 05:06.007
under my skin or something.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.440
Stupid shit.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.111
But, you know,
I was just a little kid.

05:10.144 --> 05:15.415
Actually, who gave me that idea
was one of my nannies.

05:16.818 --> 05:18.753
Indirectly, of course.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.823
'Cause she used to scream

05:21.856 --> 05:25.893
and yell at my sister
whenever she...

05:25.927 --> 05:29.429
I don't... well...

05:29.462 --> 05:31.699
Well, my sister
had such a fucked-up time

05:31.732 --> 05:33.968
at teen training.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.071
She was fucking six years old,
for god's sake.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.439
Fucking animals.
I hate those fuckers.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.374
They're going
to fucking get it, too,

05:41.408 --> 05:43.010
if I have anything
to do with it.

05:43.044 --> 05:45.445
Anyway.

05:45.478 --> 05:47.915
Stay on the course here, Rick.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.886
So I think I got 13 in here.

05:55.156 --> 05:57.758
The cool thing about
the Republicans

05:57.792 --> 05:59.927
is their love of guns.

05:59.961 --> 06:02.563
They just love
their fucking guns.

06:02.597 --> 06:05.465
With the assault ban expired,
which I credit them for,

06:05.498 --> 06:07.969
we have high capacity magazines.

06:09.770 --> 06:14.976
Now this is my super cool sheath
that I got online.

06:15.009 --> 06:17.979
It's an... I think they call
it an in-belt

06:18.012 --> 06:19.947
or in-waistband holder,

06:19.981 --> 06:21.816
so it doesn't
actually stick out.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.584
It actually goes
inside your belt

06:23.618 --> 06:25.119
so you can pull your shirt over.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.788
So... that's very cool.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.658
Anyway, when you're carrying
a loaded gun...

06:30.691 --> 06:33.426
This gun is a very safe weapon,

06:33.460 --> 06:34.962
but you know how things go.

06:34.996 --> 06:36.931
The idea of just sticking
it in my pants

06:36.964 --> 06:39.634
with a clip or whatever
didn't really appeal to me,

06:39.667 --> 06:41.636
'cause if you get
into a fight or something,

06:41.669 --> 06:44.471
or somebody stabs you
or something, or...

06:44.505 --> 06:45.773
I don't know, whatever.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.474
You're rolling on the ground.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.744
You just don't want
the fucking thing to go off.

06:49.777 --> 06:53.446
So this cool sheath works
very nice, I think.

06:55.049 --> 06:58.519
Anyway,
I went with a 40 caliber.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.454
I found a 9mm.

07:01.488 --> 07:02.857
I think everybody does.

07:02.890 --> 07:06.127
The reason is...
That I didn't go with a nine

07:06.160 --> 07:08.229
is that there's
a great debate always,

07:08.262 --> 07:10.665
because the 9mm people
say their guns

07:10.698 --> 07:14.635
are the greatest thing
since sliced fucking bread.

07:15.836 --> 07:16.771
The ammo's cheap.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.973
They're effective.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.875
Also, this is especially good

07:20.908 --> 07:23.144
for people who like firing
their guns a lot,

07:23.177 --> 07:26.847
like gang bangers maybe.

07:26.881 --> 07:30.518
Or even police officers
who have to, you know,

07:30.551 --> 07:32.687
fire their weapons
in the line of duty.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.823
A 9mm is not nearly as loud
as the bigger calibers,

07:35.856 --> 07:38.659
so you're gonna have
less hearing loss,

07:38.693 --> 07:40.227
which is cool.

07:41.162 --> 07:42.697
The only problem with nines,

07:42.730 --> 07:47.034
I was actually reading
this one story that

07:47.068 --> 07:48.636
stood out to me.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.939
As we used to say
in teen training...

07:56.610 --> 08:01.549
It was about this cop.
He was in a gun fight

08:01.582 --> 08:03.918
and he was shot
with a 9mm round.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.653
And he didn't feel it.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.556
Well, he didn't realize it
until he was fucking shot.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.224
Until the fight was over.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.759
So after that he said,

08:11.792 --> 08:15.096
I got rid of my 9,
went with a 45.

08:15.129 --> 08:16.273
I went with a 40,
because I think

08:16.297 --> 08:17.832
it's the best of both worlds.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.935
I just shot a 45
for the first time today.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.837
I was able to rent one
at the range

08:22.870 --> 08:25.873
where I'm a member at.

08:26.741 --> 08:28.909
That fucker's loud.

08:28.943 --> 08:32.213
And it didn't kick me as much
as I thought it was going to.

08:32.246 --> 08:34.115
Anyway, I like this.

08:34.148 --> 08:36.250
It's small, compact.

08:38.786 --> 08:41.555
Anyway, my high
capacity magazines

08:41.589 --> 08:43.591
went from a 10 to a 13.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.059
So that's cool.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.730
Um...

08:50.831 --> 08:53.634
I think I'm going
a little overboard.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.670
I bought a bunch of mags,
and all these fucking bullets.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.606
I went with a police round.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.974
It's a full load of powder.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.676
They don't skimp.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.645
Some people say that
the hollow points

09:04.678 --> 09:07.982
don't expand as they should
because of ballistic gelatin

09:08.015 --> 09:13.087
they use for their tests
isn't really accurate.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.891
But you see, if this fucker
goes through somebody,

09:16.924 --> 09:19.060
it's gonna expand.

09:19.093 --> 09:21.762
And that's what I'm counting on.

09:21.796 --> 09:24.331
You see, I'm counting on that
because I have my gun.

09:26.067 --> 09:29.003
All of this fucking ammo.

09:29.036 --> 09:33.774
But the truth is... is that this
is my weapon of choice.

09:35.276 --> 09:37.611
The ka-bar knife.

09:37.645 --> 09:40.948
Served marines
for many, many years.

09:41.382 --> 09:43.884
I changed the angle on mine.

09:43.918 --> 09:47.121
I learned a lot about knife
sharpening recently.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.789
They come with a 30 degree angle

09:48.823 --> 09:50.991
because these fuckers
are abused and beat on.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.160
They're used
for fucking everything.

09:53.194 --> 09:56.197
I only want it for one purpose,
and that's taking out the scum.

09:56.230 --> 09:58.799
Taking out the fucking trash.

09:58.833 --> 10:01.902
So I went with a nicer edge.

10:01.936 --> 10:04.905
A finer edge that cuts better.

10:04.939 --> 10:09.310
So I basically changed it to,
like, a kitchen knife edge,

10:09.343 --> 10:10.845
which is 17 degrees.

10:10.878 --> 10:15.182
And now... I can fucking
shave with this fucker.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.919
So one shot, one kill.

10:18.953 --> 10:21.622
Well... hopefully.

10:22.823 --> 10:26.193
Anyway, we'll see about that.

10:26.227 --> 10:29.230
Then I have some smaller
knives and stuff.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.634
Anyway, where was I?

10:34.869 --> 10:36.770
You know, I better
check to make sure

10:36.804 --> 10:39.340
that this fucking thing
is actually recording.

10:45.279 --> 10:47.381
Okay. We're back.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.817
I decided to move
the camera a little closer.

10:49.850 --> 10:53.187
I don't know if it was picking
up the best sound quality.

10:53.588 --> 10:55.156
So, anyway.

10:57.892 --> 10:59.193
Duct tape.

10:59.226 --> 11:02.229
You can fix fucking anything
with this stuff.

11:02.564 --> 11:05.299
Yeah, I'm gonna fix
some people with this.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.934
Anyway, okay.

11:06.967 --> 11:11.105
So sorry, I'm getting
all the fuck off track here.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.407
Where the fuck was I?

11:13.774 --> 11:16.143
Suicide. Yes. Suicide.

11:16.177 --> 11:19.480
A horrible thing when adults
contemplate suicide.

11:19.514 --> 11:23.117
But it's so much worse when
you've got a fucking little kid

11:23.150 --> 11:27.221
who is not born to be
a messed up little fucker

11:27.254 --> 11:31.158
but... he's a little
life, you know?

11:31.192 --> 11:34.428
She's a little life,
and you just fuck 'em over

11:34.461 --> 11:36.330
because you're
a sick fucking pervert

11:36.363 --> 11:38.832
and you don't have anything
better to do with your life

11:38.866 --> 11:41.268
than to fuck up
your little kids.

11:41.302 --> 11:43.804
It's just so far beyond me.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.473
I can't fucking imagine it,
but yet it happened.

11:46.508 --> 11:48.409
It happened right before me.

11:48.442 --> 11:50.344
Happened to all of you.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.046
Thousands of us.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.248
Some worse than others.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.519
I had it good in many ways.

11:57.552 --> 12:00.788
I didn't get fucked in the ass,
you know, I was a guy.

12:01.523 --> 12:04.091
Lot of you girls... crap.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.262
I can't even compare
my stories with yours.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.364
But that's not
what this is about,

12:10.397 --> 12:12.766
we're not sitting here comparing

12:12.800 --> 12:14.536
"oh, you got it
worse than I did,"

12:14.569 --> 12:17.037
or "you got it more times
than I did,"

12:17.071 --> 12:18.839
because it's not about that.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.509
There so many other kinds
of abuse that went on

12:21.543 --> 12:25.012
that to some of us just as bad,
and to some of us it wasn't.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.880
And some of us
didn't have it that bad.

12:26.914 --> 12:30.417
I'm not gonna sit here and say
"oh yeah, I had it worse,"

12:30.451 --> 12:33.254
or "I didn't,"
because it doesn't matter.

12:33.287 --> 12:36.490
It should have never happened
at all, to anybody.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.260
That's the point.

12:40.194 --> 12:44.898
So, that's when I started
contemplating suicide.

12:44.932 --> 12:48.168
And I've been fucking thinking
about it ever since.

12:48.202 --> 12:53.240
Because man, god dammit,
after teen training...

12:53.274 --> 12:54.875
Shit.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.545
It's like all hell broke loose.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.347
We were just never the same.

13:03.450 --> 13:07.354
I got into martial arts
a while ago.

13:07.388 --> 13:09.923
I'm still basically
a beginner, you know.

13:09.957 --> 13:13.227
I mean, you think of somebody
who spends a lifetime,

13:13.260 --> 13:14.828
like, 30 years,

13:14.862 --> 13:17.599
like my teacher
in Washington had.

13:17.632 --> 13:19.466
Thirty years studying
martial arts,

13:19.500 --> 13:21.468
and the guy's still
learning every day.

13:21.503 --> 13:25.540
So I studied, what?
Like, a year, two years.

13:25.573 --> 13:28.208
I'm just a fucking novice.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.979
But hey, it all helps.

13:33.581 --> 13:36.850
I thought it would help more,
I guess, for me,

13:36.884 --> 13:40.555
but... I think I'm just really
fucked in the head.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.324
I've tried so many things.

13:43.357 --> 13:46.493
Trying to somehow to fit in.

13:46.528 --> 13:51.131
Somehow to find,
you know, a normal life.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.568
Nah, everybody sucks.

13:53.601 --> 13:57.237
Everybody has said,
who I talk to about this,

13:57.271 --> 13:59.306
well, you know,

13:59.340 --> 14:01.576
that everybody
has their problems

14:01.609 --> 14:02.976
in this fucked up life.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.479
But those people
that say that, you know,

14:05.513 --> 14:09.249
they don't have a clue
as to what actually went on.

14:09.283 --> 14:12.520
I mean, 'cause they weren't
part of a cult.

14:12.554 --> 14:16.624
They were just your average
"systemites" I talk to.

14:16.658 --> 14:19.594
Well man, I'm so happy for them.

14:19.627 --> 14:23.397
And I'm so happy
that yeah, sure,

14:23.430 --> 14:25.899
they didn't have it
perfect at home,

14:25.933 --> 14:29.504
but, you know, it wasn't
like this for everybody.

14:29.537 --> 14:33.541
But there's a number of guys
that I talk to in Washington...

14:35.142 --> 14:37.344
I sort of consider
Washington my home,

14:37.378 --> 14:40.013
because that's basically
where I was

14:40.047 --> 14:41.949
the last four years or so,

14:41.982 --> 14:44.519
ever since I left.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.989
So, now, this is interesting,

14:49.022 --> 14:53.160
because I don't think most
other family kids

14:53.193 --> 14:55.630
can relate to this
because, yeah, they were abused.

14:55.663 --> 14:57.665
But one thing I don't think

14:57.699 --> 15:00.602
that they were that much
is secluded.

15:00.635 --> 15:03.003
And that can really
fuck you over,

15:03.036 --> 15:08.275
because if you don't have
that mirror, if you will,

15:08.308 --> 15:10.645
of kids your own age,

15:10.678 --> 15:13.313
kids that are older than you,

15:13.347 --> 15:19.386
siblings, whatever, friends,
then it really fucks you up.

15:19.420 --> 15:26.059
And I was reading an article
about how there were...

15:26.093 --> 15:27.327
How some people say...

15:27.361 --> 15:30.130
It was one
of those conspiracy things.

15:31.298 --> 15:34.067
I can believe it, it's possible.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.136
And who knows?

15:37.004 --> 15:41.108
Anyway, they were saying
how they were doing experiments

15:41.141 --> 15:43.578
on prisoners in the states

15:43.611 --> 15:48.215
for the last 40 years
or something

15:49.016 --> 15:51.018
trying to see
how they can break 'em.

15:51.051 --> 15:54.354
And translate those findings
to the general populace.

15:54.388 --> 15:56.758
Modified, of course.

15:56.791 --> 15:59.527
I don't know
if it's true or not.

15:59.561 --> 16:02.463
It was interesting
reading, anyway.

16:03.163 --> 16:06.701
But that's what happened to me.

16:06.734 --> 16:09.169
Not having that mirror
of other people

16:09.203 --> 16:13.006
to hold up and see
how I would relate to them

16:13.040 --> 16:16.243
and, you know,
in those formative years...

16:16.276 --> 16:18.780
If you're only
fucking around perverts.

16:18.813 --> 16:20.748
These people are fucked
in the head,

16:20.782 --> 16:22.784
and try to fuck you over.

16:22.817 --> 16:25.620
Wow. I didn't even have TV,
for god's sake.

16:28.155 --> 16:32.426
So anyway,
when I started martial arts,

16:32.459 --> 16:34.762
I got into knives.

16:36.163 --> 16:39.233
I thought knives
were the coolest thing.

16:39.266 --> 16:44.639
I'd experimented with trying
to make, you know... retractors.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.242
I guess every teen boy does.

16:48.710 --> 16:50.578
Of course with me, you know,

16:50.612 --> 16:52.514
if anybody saw it, it was like,

16:52.547 --> 16:56.350
"oh my god, don't you know that
you're full of the devil!"

16:56.383 --> 16:59.587
So I would just sort
of hide all my shit.

16:59.621 --> 17:02.757
That was around the whole
bodybuilding time.

17:02.790 --> 17:05.192
What a joke.

17:05.225 --> 17:08.495
But anyway, I just got
fascinated with knives,

17:08.530 --> 17:12.099
and because, you know,
actually when this started,

17:12.132 --> 17:14.502
believe it or not, this was back

17:14.536 --> 17:19.306
when they were trying
to fix and reindoctrinate

17:19.339 --> 17:23.310
my sister merry after she tried
to expose the family.

17:24.311 --> 17:27.515
Okay, we had, as kids...

17:27.549 --> 17:29.651
I didn't get along that well
with merry

17:29.684 --> 17:31.251
because she was older.

17:31.285 --> 17:34.689
She was better at playing
the game than we were.

17:34.722 --> 17:37.391
We were just little fuckers,
trying to have fun.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.459
She set the bar so high,

17:39.493 --> 17:42.429
because they really
did grade on a curve.

17:43.598 --> 17:45.633
It made it tough for us.

17:46.066 --> 17:50.805
But, you know,
none of us rejoiced

17:50.838 --> 17:54.174
when that happened
to her. Nobody.

17:54.207 --> 17:58.111
Nobody deserved that,
especially not a kid that age.

17:59.346 --> 18:04.318
So I watched every day,
new bruises on her.

18:04.351 --> 18:07.755
Big fucking, fat fucking
bruises on her.

18:07.789 --> 18:09.423
I started thinking to myself,

18:09.456 --> 18:12.660
"holy fuck! You know,
there's gotta be a way...

18:12.694 --> 18:14.596
There's gotta be
a way that one person

18:14.629 --> 18:17.331
can stand up to a group
of strong men.

18:17.364 --> 18:20.434
There's gotta be some
sort of equalizer."

18:20.467 --> 18:22.436
And I found that equalizer.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.305
In edged weapons.

18:25.339 --> 18:26.641
In training.

18:27.542 --> 18:32.747
But I never had a chance
to learn till I left.

18:33.514 --> 18:35.717
And even then I was

18:35.750 --> 18:39.854
into finding an art that was
just brutal about self-defense.

18:39.887 --> 18:44.592
Just, you know, give me
the worst technique possible

18:44.626 --> 18:46.594
and I wanna learn that.

18:46.628 --> 18:48.663
Not because I'm that way
as a human being,

18:48.696 --> 18:51.164
but I've seen how ugly
human beings can get

18:51.198 --> 18:53.500
when they wanna fuck
people over.

18:53.534 --> 18:55.335
Fuck little kids over.

18:55.737 --> 18:58.840
And when... if I ever see that,

18:58.873 --> 19:01.843
if that ever happens to me,
it's that whole mentality.

19:01.876 --> 19:03.544
I'm gonna get down to business

19:03.578 --> 19:05.713
and there's not gonna
be anything left.

19:05.747 --> 19:08.215
That's just what I
was looking for.

19:08.549 --> 19:09.884
Didn't find it.

19:10.885 --> 19:12.486
I tried karate for a while.

19:12.520 --> 19:16.490
I always knew that I
didn't have the time.

19:18.425 --> 19:21.228
I guess that I was just
trying to fit in.

19:21.261 --> 19:25.465
I was... it was something
in the back of my mind.

19:25.499 --> 19:27.300
It was always like...

19:28.803 --> 19:32.239
I'd always felt like
the resources that I had

19:32.272 --> 19:34.742
just weren't adequate,
and no matter how much I did,

19:34.776 --> 19:38.412
I'd replenish those resources,
it just wasn't happening.

19:38.445 --> 19:41.448
So I was just using my own power
without replenishing it.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.817
Eventually it would be gone,

19:42.850 --> 19:44.585
which is kind of
what I feel now.

19:44.619 --> 19:48.221
But anyway,
getting back to that.

19:48.656 --> 19:51.391
I finally found this teacher.

19:51.959 --> 19:53.895
He was really cool.

19:54.361 --> 19:57.832
He was sort of a new age guy,

19:57.865 --> 20:01.669
but man, that guy
could fucking kick ass.

20:01.703 --> 20:06.239
He was... he studied
an Indonesian system

20:06.273 --> 20:10.978
which was under
their pencak silat umbrella.

20:11.012 --> 20:15.282
Very brutal.
No fucking around system.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.519
So... oh, I got two rounds left.

20:19.053 --> 20:20.420
Anyway.

20:20.454 --> 20:22.623
So I always figured that...

20:22.657 --> 20:25.358
And I always still think
about suicide

20:25.392 --> 20:27.695
and I try to push it away.

20:27.729 --> 20:29.362
I am successful for a while,

20:29.396 --> 20:31.666
but it always comes back.

20:31.699 --> 20:34.635
It started coming back
more frequently,

20:35.503 --> 20:38.005
those thoughts, and...

20:39.674 --> 20:41.408
And I just...

20:42.043 --> 20:44.545
I just wanted it to end.

20:44.579 --> 20:48.716
That was my hope
and also my fear.

20:49.083 --> 20:53.554
That when I died,
I would just want to flatline

20:53.588 --> 20:54.756
and nothing else,

20:54.789 --> 20:56.557
'cause I would not
wanna go through,

20:56.591 --> 20:58.325
in another dimension,

20:58.358 --> 21:00.661
what I'm going through here,
and what I had been through.

21:01.929 --> 21:04.699
Now I'm not so sure about that.

21:04.732 --> 21:06.466
I don't really know
what to think,

21:06.500 --> 21:09.670
but I think there's enough
evidence, if you will,

21:09.704 --> 21:14.542
to at least make one stop
and consider

21:14.575 --> 21:17.578
that we may not believe
in god, but I don't,

21:17.612 --> 21:20.548
at least certainly not
the Christian fucked up god

21:20.581 --> 21:21.916
who has a big fucking dick

21:21.949 --> 21:24.852
that he wants to stick up
everyone's ass.

21:24.886 --> 21:29.657
But I don't know, I'm starting
to think that life goes on,

21:29.690 --> 21:32.794
and that fucking scares me.

21:32.827 --> 21:35.096
That really does scare me
more than anything,

21:35.129 --> 21:39.066
because I don't know,
I don't want it to go on.

21:39.100 --> 21:41.636
I just want it to be over.

21:42.637 --> 21:47.440
So anyway... I think about
suicide all the time.

21:47.809 --> 21:49.610
Then I figured I'd
cut my wrists,

21:49.644 --> 21:52.412
because I like knives
so much, you know.

21:53.214 --> 21:57.785
But everybody does this,
to simply cut across the wrist.

21:57.819 --> 22:00.621
Sometimes more than once.

22:00.655 --> 22:02.089
One's bullshit.

22:02.123 --> 22:04.826
They say the best thing to do
is to get a scalpel.

22:04.859 --> 22:08.696
It's incredibly small,
sharp, and just dig,

22:08.729 --> 22:12.432
dig in right there
and go as far as you can go.

22:12.465 --> 22:15.136
So yeah, I was thinking
that's pretty cool, you know.

22:15.169 --> 22:19.974
Maybe I'll, you know,
rent a nice hotel.

22:20.007 --> 22:22.643
Nice hotel, you know,
maybe the penthouse.

22:22.677 --> 22:26.581
Run a nice fucking bath
in the jacuzzi tub.

22:26.614 --> 22:31.886
Spend the night
with a nice hooker.

22:31.919 --> 22:33.554
I thought that'd be cool,

22:33.588 --> 22:35.923
because I've never been
with a hooker before.

22:35.957 --> 22:38.726
And...

22:38.759 --> 22:42.597
Anyway, it's like Tom says,

22:42.630 --> 22:44.765
you're gonna pay for sex
one way or another.

22:44.799 --> 22:47.802
Might was well pay somebody
who knows what they're doing.

22:47.835 --> 22:50.872
So anyway,
that's sort of my dream.

22:51.339 --> 22:54.008
Not the end, you know.

22:55.009 --> 22:56.744
Have some beers,

22:56.777 --> 22:59.479
get out my scalpel
in a nice hot jacuzzi tub.

22:59.513 --> 23:01.082
Just end it.

23:02.717 --> 23:06.020
Without enough time
to breathe out.

23:06.053 --> 23:10.591
Before that, though,
I just wanted to leave.

23:10.625 --> 23:13.194
Just wanted to take whatever
money I'd saved up

23:13.227 --> 23:16.731
and just go somewhere cool,
like Bali.

23:17.031 --> 23:18.900
And now...

23:19.567 --> 23:23.004
Indonesia isn't the greatest
place to be.

23:23.037 --> 23:25.106
I don't know about Bali.

23:25.139 --> 23:29.143
Not so good on my Indonesian
geography right now.

23:29.176 --> 23:32.046
But... somewhere like that.

23:33.147 --> 23:35.716
Could be anywhere, really.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.118
It'd have to be warm

23:37.151 --> 23:40.588
and it would have to have
a nice Sandy beach.

23:40.621 --> 23:44.091
And... lots of pretty girls.

23:44.125 --> 23:46.861
And you know, just go.

23:47.862 --> 23:49.530
Wait till the money runs out.

23:49.563 --> 23:52.566
You know, just have fun,
just have a break.

23:53.634 --> 23:56.003
I've been going
non-fucking stop,

23:56.037 --> 23:59.006
like I'm sure
everybody else has,

23:59.040 --> 24:02.076
since I've left
that fucking cult.

24:03.244 --> 24:05.813
And man, that fishing.

24:05.846 --> 24:08.481
Fucking Christ that was hard.

24:08.516 --> 24:09.917
That was fucking hell.

24:09.951 --> 24:11.819
That would be one of
my ideas of hell,

24:11.852 --> 24:14.722
is to be on that fishing boat
for eternity.

24:14.755 --> 24:16.590
God dammit.

24:16.624 --> 24:18.693
It was fucking nasty.

24:18.726 --> 24:20.995
Part of it was because
it was my first job, you know,

24:21.028 --> 24:24.865
it was my first
real introduction

24:24.899 --> 24:28.803
to life on the outside,
was that.

24:30.071 --> 24:33.808
And yeah, it was a jumpstart.
Let me tell you.

24:33.841 --> 24:38.245
But... I got through it
and I did really well.

24:38.279 --> 24:41.282
I got an extremely good
review and a good bonus

24:41.315 --> 24:42.750
and it was cool.

24:42.783 --> 24:45.619
It was a good experience,
but anyway.

24:46.587 --> 24:48.289
Getting back to suicide.

24:48.322 --> 24:51.025
That's what I wanted to do then.

24:51.058 --> 24:52.960
I would kill myself,

24:52.994 --> 24:56.731
and god how I wanted to do that.

24:56.764 --> 25:00.034
I want to follow that scenario.

25:00.067 --> 25:01.202
I just wanna leave.

25:01.235 --> 25:04.105
Spend a few months
and then end it.

25:05.706 --> 25:07.842
But you know what I feel
about that, that would be

25:07.875 --> 25:09.243
the selfish thing to do,

25:09.276 --> 25:11.545
that would be
the quitter's way out.

25:11.579 --> 25:14.849
Because yeah, I'm sort
of quitting right now,

25:14.882 --> 25:17.118
but in a way, I'm not,
because I'm not doing it

25:17.151 --> 25:19.687
the way that I wanna do it.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.556
I'm trying to do
something lasting.

25:22.590 --> 25:24.225
Something that, god forbid,

25:24.258 --> 25:26.327
in the next life,
if it does go on,

25:26.360 --> 25:29.263
I can look back at this
and if I'm able to and know

25:29.296 --> 25:32.633
that, okay, maybe I didn't
technically do the right thing,

25:32.666 --> 25:35.236
but I tried to do
something to help.

25:35.669 --> 25:38.239
I didn't just fade away.

25:38.773 --> 25:41.242
I didn't just turn tail

25:41.275 --> 25:44.045
and run and let
those fuckers win.

25:44.078 --> 25:46.247
But I did what I could
to make a difference.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.983
And I don't know how really far
that I'm gonna get.

25:49.016 --> 25:52.319
And it's starting to look like
it's not going to be very far,

25:52.353 --> 25:54.722
and that's gonna suck ass.

25:56.791 --> 26:01.062
I might not... well I'll get one
person, that's for sure.

26:01.095 --> 26:03.631
My source for the information.

26:03.664 --> 26:08.836
The goal is to bring down those
sick fuckers, mama and Peter.

26:09.870 --> 26:11.939
My own mother.

26:11.972 --> 26:14.341
What an evil little cunt.
God dammit.

26:14.375 --> 26:16.077
How can you do that to kids?

26:16.110 --> 26:19.847
How can you do that to kids
and then sleep at night?

26:19.880 --> 26:21.849
I don't fucking know.

26:22.283 --> 26:23.951
Anyway.

26:24.919 --> 26:26.720
That's my goal.

26:26.754 --> 26:29.824
But I'm one person

26:29.857 --> 26:33.761
and I'm working under situations

26:33.794 --> 26:35.629
that aren't that
great right now,

26:35.663 --> 26:38.899
because I only have
a small window of opportunity

26:38.933 --> 26:43.304
to get the information that
I need out of this person.

26:45.172 --> 26:47.341
I'm not trained
in torture methods,

26:47.374 --> 26:50.845
which is... why I'm gonna
have to make do.

26:51.679 --> 26:55.049
I got my drill here.

26:55.082 --> 26:57.818
The reason why it's got this
fucking padding on here

26:57.852 --> 27:00.955
is because I'm trying
to silence it a little bit.

27:00.988 --> 27:02.656
I'm in an apartment.

27:03.157 --> 27:05.392
I got gags.

27:05.426 --> 27:07.194
Fucking socks.

27:07.995 --> 27:10.264
I got a soldering iron.

27:10.297 --> 27:12.700
Heat.

27:12.733 --> 27:15.836
I got a crude implement
that can work wonders,

27:15.870 --> 27:18.906
especially if it's used
in the right way.

27:18.939 --> 27:20.674
But...

27:20.708 --> 27:23.043
I'm not trained, I don't
know how to fucking do this.

27:23.077 --> 27:25.713
I don't wanna fucking
do this, god dammit.

27:28.949 --> 27:31.152
Oh man, you gotta see this.

27:31.185 --> 27:33.154
This is not for torture,

27:33.187 --> 27:34.955
but man it could be.

27:34.989 --> 27:39.160
775,000 volts.

27:39.193 --> 27:40.928
You've gotta hear this puppy.

27:43.197 --> 27:44.331
Wow!

27:44.732 --> 27:47.268
That's gotta scare anybody.

27:50.871 --> 27:54.408
But it's not gonna be
used for scaring.

27:54.441 --> 27:59.380
It's gonna be used for
temporarily incapacitating them.

27:59.413 --> 28:02.049
It's a non-lethal weapon.

28:03.017 --> 28:04.919
Anyway.

28:05.953 --> 28:07.788
So I don't wanna turn and run,

28:07.821 --> 28:09.890
you know, I don't wanna...

28:09.924 --> 28:12.960
My goal is to get those
sick fucks, mama and Peter,

28:12.993 --> 28:15.462
and then I can go
to the next life,

28:15.496 --> 28:19.867
knowing that... you know,
I made a difference.

28:20.901 --> 28:22.937
I'll still go.

28:22.970 --> 28:24.939
No matter what happens
I'll still go,

28:24.972 --> 28:26.508
knowing that I tried.

28:26.541 --> 28:29.777
That I did the best that
I could at the time.

28:29.810 --> 28:33.113
Given my experiences,
given my state of mind,

28:33.147 --> 28:34.481
given that I was alone,

28:34.516 --> 28:37.818
given that I struggled
with so many things,

28:37.851 --> 28:41.889
given that, you know,
that if I had it clear,

28:41.922 --> 28:48.162
if I had the warrior's mind,
like miyamoto musashi

28:48.195 --> 28:51.165
wrote about in a
<i>book of five rings,</i>

28:51.198 --> 28:53.367
you know, that I probably
would have gotten

28:53.400 --> 28:55.436
a lot further in this endeavor.

28:55.469 --> 28:58.540
You know, just thinking
of nothing,

28:58.573 --> 29:01.475
nothing by killing
your opponent single-minded,

29:01.509 --> 29:04.812
no background noise in the mind.

29:04.845 --> 29:06.847
No eternal chatter.

29:06.880 --> 29:09.817
Getting down to business
and doing it.

29:11.952 --> 29:15.856
But unfortunately it hasn't
been that easy for me.

29:16.558 --> 29:17.992
Anyway.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.127
Anyway, I'll give it a shot.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.263
We'll see what happens.

29:22.796 --> 29:24.431
Hopefully if I don't make it,

29:24.465 --> 29:27.501
hopefully somebody else
will pick up the torch.

29:27.535 --> 29:30.938
Hopefully in the end,
whether they rot in jail

29:30.971 --> 29:33.407
and get buffoed in the ass
by some inmate,

29:33.440 --> 29:36.443
or whether somebody blows
their fucking head off,

29:36.477 --> 29:38.379
or slits their fucking throat,

29:38.412 --> 29:41.048
hopefully somebody will do
something effectively

29:41.081 --> 29:44.084
that will end their fucking
miserable lives.

29:45.052 --> 29:46.487
But anyway.

29:46.521 --> 29:49.189
My main incentive in this
is knowing

29:49.223 --> 29:53.260
that it will make me feel
a whole fuck of a lot better.

29:53.961 --> 30:00.134
But maybe it'll bring,
well, if I'm successful,

30:00.167 --> 30:03.337
which is starting
to look kind of slim,

30:03.370 --> 30:06.974
slim chance right now,
but it's worth a shot.

30:08.976 --> 30:13.515
Because if I am successful,
I mean, I can just see

30:13.548 --> 30:16.950
those fucking thousands
of family kids,

30:16.984 --> 30:19.554
you know,
who have been abused...

30:20.287 --> 30:22.856
Okay, well maybe
there's not 1,000.

30:22.890 --> 30:24.892
But you know,
maybe some of the kids,

30:24.925 --> 30:27.227
especially the new generation.

30:27.261 --> 30:29.564
They don't know
that they're abused.

30:29.597 --> 30:32.099
They don't think they...

30:32.132 --> 30:34.902
I guess they certainly
haven't been sexually abused,

30:34.935 --> 30:36.904
but you know what?
That's not good enough.

30:36.937 --> 30:39.206
Because what about
the thousands of us

30:39.239 --> 30:42.142
who have been fucked over?
Literally.

30:42.176 --> 30:45.112
What about us?
Where's our apology?

30:45.145 --> 30:46.980
They're not even sorry.

30:47.014 --> 30:49.283
They're not even fucking sorry.

30:49.316 --> 30:51.619
Can you imagine all of a sudden,
to hear one day,

30:51.653 --> 30:54.888
"guess what? Mama and Peter
are fucking dead."

30:54.922 --> 30:57.157
Yeah, somebody went
into their house

30:57.191 --> 30:59.093
or their fucking motor home
or whatever

30:59.126 --> 31:02.229
and poured gasoline on them
and they lit a match

31:02.262 --> 31:03.598
and had a fucking barbeque.

31:03.631 --> 31:05.499
Wow! Can you imagine?

31:05.533 --> 31:07.669
I can imagine putting
myself in this place.

31:07.702 --> 31:12.039
How it would make me feel if I
heard that somebody did that.

31:12.072 --> 31:17.010
And I would be like, "wow!
There is justice in this world."

31:17.044 --> 31:19.380
And an incredible weight
would be lifted

31:19.413 --> 31:20.682
off my shoulders,

31:20.715 --> 31:22.950
and I would be able
to go on with my life.

31:23.718 --> 31:25.452
Yeah I'd have fucking problems,

31:25.486 --> 31:28.656
but I got stuck
on this one thing.

31:28.690 --> 31:32.259
I got stuck because
there's this need that I have.

31:32.292 --> 31:35.129
This need. It's not a want,
it's a fucking need.

31:35.162 --> 31:37.931
And I wish it wasn't, but it is.

31:37.965 --> 31:39.333
It's a need for revenge.

31:39.366 --> 31:42.069
It's a need for justice,
because I...

31:42.102 --> 31:44.371
I can't go on like this.

31:44.706 --> 31:47.241
So I can imagine how
I would feel,

31:47.274 --> 31:49.677
how liberating it would be.

31:49.711 --> 31:52.479
And I hope that I'm successful.

31:52.514 --> 31:54.348
Like, I can't see how

31:54.381 --> 31:56.618
I wouldn't have
this effect on people.

31:56.651 --> 31:59.420
You know, any...

31:59.453 --> 32:01.221
Anything you talk
about the family

32:01.255 --> 32:02.724
would just end up like,

32:02.757 --> 32:05.693
"oh but Jesus Christ,
they got what they deserved."

32:05.727 --> 32:07.361
That's worth dying for.

32:07.394 --> 32:09.163
Even the thought,
even the attempt

32:09.196 --> 32:11.265
at bringing that
about for people.

32:11.298 --> 32:14.669
That gift for them is
worth dying for.

32:15.035 --> 32:16.604
You bet it is.

32:16.638 --> 32:20.140
So that's what I'm
gonna try to do.

32:20.174 --> 32:23.477
I'm gonna try,
I'm gonna try my very best.

32:25.012 --> 32:28.516
Now, there is
one problem, though,

32:28.550 --> 32:33.621
and that is as I go
on my merry way,

32:33.655 --> 32:37.525
I'm not going to... hurt

32:37.559 --> 32:41.462
or try to hurt
any law enforcement.

32:41.495 --> 32:44.198
Now, that's gonna be
really tough to do this,

32:44.231 --> 32:45.466
without doing that.

32:45.499 --> 32:49.002
But... that's where
I draw the line.

32:49.604 --> 32:51.171
I'm not gonna hurt them.

32:51.205 --> 32:54.274
I'm not going to try
to hurt them.

32:54.308 --> 32:57.144
I respect law enforcement.

32:57.177 --> 32:59.747
The justice system
has let us down,

32:59.781 --> 33:02.316
however, those cops
are out there,

33:02.349 --> 33:04.384
putting their lives
on the line for us,

33:04.418 --> 33:06.320
and I must say...

33:06.353 --> 33:08.723
Yeah, there's some
fucked-up cops out there.

33:08.756 --> 33:12.426
But I'm thankful for them
and I respect them.

33:12.861 --> 33:18.298
I got to know an ins agent.

33:18.600 --> 33:21.335
He's a really cool guy
at my range.

33:21.368 --> 33:24.304
That's where I got
my concealed weapons permit.

33:24.338 --> 33:28.308
And I'm so glad that I did that,

33:28.342 --> 33:31.478
'cause even though I really
don't carry my gun around,

33:31.513 --> 33:35.249
because my gun's really
only for one purpose.

33:35.282 --> 33:38.085
Even though I have
all these bullets,

33:38.118 --> 33:41.188
I guess I figured it's better
to have them and not need them.

33:41.221 --> 33:46.293
But I really only need one,
and that's for myself.

33:50.163 --> 33:53.033
So I don't carry my gun around.

33:55.135 --> 33:58.105
I'm so glad I went to that
concealed weapons permit class,

33:58.138 --> 33:59.841
because I learned so much.

33:59.874 --> 34:02.175
I learned about the law.

34:03.878 --> 34:05.813
One cool thing that I learned,

34:05.847 --> 34:08.282
and this is something
that our instructor

34:08.315 --> 34:10.384
brought up out of the blue,

34:10.417 --> 34:14.388
that here in our great
state of Arizona,

34:14.421 --> 34:17.090
Jesus land as some
people call it,

34:17.124 --> 34:20.795
if you catch an adult
sexually abusing a minor,

34:20.828 --> 34:22.396
if you catch them in the act,

34:22.429 --> 34:25.465
you can walk up to them
and execute them.

34:25.499 --> 34:27.835
And it would be
a justifiable homicide.

34:27.869 --> 34:30.337
A legal shooting.

34:30.370 --> 34:32.139
You better damn well
be able to prove

34:32.172 --> 34:34.809
it was actually happening,
or you're gonna be fucked.

34:34.842 --> 34:38.345
But the law still stands,
it's legal.

34:38.780 --> 34:41.315
And that brings
a smile to my face,

34:41.348 --> 34:43.785
every time I fucking
think about that.

34:44.217 --> 34:45.853
But you know what?

34:45.887 --> 34:50.223
My instructor said,
"that's too good for them."

34:50.825 --> 34:53.895
It's too good for them

34:53.928 --> 34:57.532
just to walk up and put
a bullet in their head.

34:57.565 --> 34:59.366
This is a normal dude, you know,

34:59.399 --> 35:02.402
and I looked around,
everybody in the class,

35:02.436 --> 35:05.138
vigorously shaking,
nodding their heads

35:05.172 --> 35:07.542
and saying,
"yeah, that's fucking right."

35:07.575 --> 35:09.443
You know,
these are normal people.

35:09.476 --> 35:11.244
They're talking about walking up

35:11.278 --> 35:14.549
and blowing somebody's
head off for doing it once.

35:15.248 --> 35:18.185
Well, what does that tell you?

35:18.218 --> 35:21.388
Maybe I'm not so weird
after all, you know.

35:21.421 --> 35:24.391
Now of course, you've gotta
catch 'em in the act.

35:24.424 --> 35:30.397
Well, you know, it's a little
too late for that, for us.

35:30.732 --> 35:34.167
But the truth is,
that's the way people think.

35:34.201 --> 35:35.503
That's the way people think

35:35.536 --> 35:37.505
about these sick
fucked-up perverts.

35:37.538 --> 35:39.874
Just get 'em out of the way.

35:39.907 --> 35:41.408
So I...

35:41.843 --> 35:43.410
<i>Boondock saints.</i>

35:43.443 --> 35:45.580
If you at all have a chance
to see that movie,

35:45.613 --> 35:47.481
it's excellent.

35:47.515 --> 35:50.417
I've watched that movie
so many times.

35:50.952 --> 35:53.955
It's just... yeah.

35:53.988 --> 35:56.758
You just get sick
and fucking tired.

35:57.257 --> 36:01.729
Now, they weren't really
executing child abusers,

36:01.763 --> 36:06.768
they were executing
drug dealers and murderers.

36:06.801 --> 36:08.970
Mafia, all that kind of shit.

36:09.003 --> 36:11.739
But anyway...

36:11.773 --> 36:14.642
People don't really seem
to care that much

36:14.676 --> 36:18.311
when those kind of people
start dropping like flies.

36:18.345 --> 36:20.748
Makes the world a safer place.

36:21.082 --> 36:24.451
But that's not why I'm doing
it to make it safer,

36:24.484 --> 36:26.654
I'm doing it for justice.

36:26.688 --> 36:27.955
I'm doing it for myself.

36:27.989 --> 36:29.857
I'm doing it
for a lot of other people

36:29.891 --> 36:33.293
who would like to see those
fuckers go down.

36:33.995 --> 36:36.564
So anyway, here I am.

36:37.330 --> 36:40.233
I've been lucky,
I guess in some ways.

36:41.602 --> 36:44.005
You know,
I was expecting to come here

36:44.038 --> 36:49.443
and have to pull a kind of
<i>47 Ronin</i> kind of thing,

36:50.210 --> 36:52.980
where to avenge
the death of their lord,

36:53.014 --> 36:58.351
they had to become, you know,
vagrants and bums, basically,

36:58.385 --> 37:00.621
for two years. Whatever.

37:00.655 --> 37:03.991
So I guess I'm lucky
I didn't have to wait that long.

37:04.892 --> 37:08.763
Just shows how stupid
these fucking cultists are.

37:08.796 --> 37:12.466
You know, just even
after all I wrote...

37:12.499 --> 37:16.470
Even in the last thing I wrote
on the "moving on" website

37:16.504 --> 37:18.973
where I was just trying
to get some help with this,

37:19.006 --> 37:21.475
but you know what?
I was kind of glad I didn't get

37:21.509 --> 37:24.612
any help with this,
even though I wanted it.

37:24.645 --> 37:26.279
Because to me, I mean,

37:26.313 --> 37:28.583
I was as clear
in that as I could be

37:28.616 --> 37:30.383
without actually
spelling it out.

37:30.417 --> 37:33.320
And I'm glad, you know.

37:34.055 --> 37:36.758
I'm glad that others of us

37:36.791 --> 37:39.527
haven't gotten to the point
that I've gotten to,

37:39.560 --> 37:41.796
where we really don't
have anything to lose.

37:41.829 --> 37:44.397
You know,
I'm happy because it...

37:44.431 --> 37:46.667
What it tells me is that, yeah,

37:46.701 --> 37:49.871
people still have hope,
they're still going on.

37:51.839 --> 37:57.779
This one guy, he said that
he knew what I meant

37:57.812 --> 38:01.749
right off the bat,
right after reading that.

38:01.783 --> 38:06.821
And he said that
we're dropping like flies.

38:08.421 --> 38:10.490
Well, I don't know if we're
dropping out that fast,

38:10.525 --> 38:13.895
but yeah, a lot of people
are going out.

38:16.564 --> 38:19.600
I don't know, I think it's kind
of easy to just one night,

38:19.634 --> 38:23.671
you know, one day just...
Decide to end it.

38:23.704 --> 38:25.773
Just do it.

38:27.407 --> 38:29.811
But I think it's pretty
fucking hard to do

38:29.844 --> 38:36.050
what I've been trying to do
and, like, plan to where I know,

38:36.083 --> 38:38.351
not really knowing when,

38:38.385 --> 38:41.823
but soon I'm gonna have to go.

38:44.892 --> 38:50.798
But I don't know, it's...
It's harder not...

38:50.832 --> 38:53.601
It's a lot harder
than I thought it would be.

38:53.634 --> 38:58.139
But yeah, I really don't have
anything to lose, I think.

38:58.172 --> 39:00.440
Yeah, I don't really wanna...

39:00.875 --> 39:05.079
Go through my life
the way it is now.

39:05.445 --> 39:07.849
I've tried for four years.

39:08.249 --> 39:10.117
Sure, it's not long.

39:12.653 --> 39:14.755
Feels like a fucking lifetime.

39:15.556 --> 39:18.125
Feels like a god damn
lifetime to me,

39:18.159 --> 39:22.563
and every day,
if it had just gotten better,

39:22.597 --> 39:25.600
just a little better
even emotionally,

39:25.633 --> 39:27.935
mentally for me, and...

39:27.969 --> 39:32.106
It would have been okay.
It would have given me hope.

39:32.139 --> 39:34.175
But it's gotten worse.

39:34.208 --> 39:37.078
Every fucking day
has been a little worse

39:37.111 --> 39:39.113
than the day before.

39:44.752 --> 39:46.087
Um...

39:46.354 --> 39:49.489
It kind of reminds me
of that movie <i>office space,</i>

39:49.924 --> 39:53.628
where he's talking
to the hypnotherapist.

39:53.661 --> 39:56.864
And he says that
every day is a little worse.

39:56.898 --> 39:59.432
And the guy says
"well, that's fucked up."

39:59.466 --> 40:03.170
And he catches himself
and apologizes.

40:05.940 --> 40:08.976
But yeah, it's fucked up,
it's really fucked up.

40:09.010 --> 40:11.178
But, hey, it's a life,

40:11.212 --> 40:14.982
and we're gonna play
the hand that we're dealt.

40:17.251 --> 40:21.088
So anyway,
like James penn would say,

40:21.122 --> 40:24.592
time to get busy living
or get busy dying.

40:25.793 --> 40:28.495
Yeah, James penn
got busy living.

40:29.597 --> 40:31.866
Guess I'm trying
to get busy dying.

40:32.432 --> 40:34.902
But, you know, people die.

40:34.936 --> 40:37.171
They do, every day.

40:38.272 --> 40:39.874
Every day.

40:40.574 --> 40:43.978
Its gonna happen
to everybody, you know.

40:44.011 --> 40:45.713
Sometime I wish that, you know,

40:45.746 --> 40:49.216
I'd get the <i>braveheart</i>
speech from somebody.

40:49.250 --> 40:55.089
But it's true, you know,
I feel like we're in a war here.

40:55.890 --> 40:59.126
It's not necessarily
like a literal war,

40:59.160 --> 41:00.728
like I'm making...

41:00.761 --> 41:03.197
But it's a war nonetheless.

41:03.230 --> 41:07.802
I feel like every one
of us who is left

41:07.835 --> 41:09.637
in some way speaks out,

41:09.670 --> 41:11.639
in some way tries
to help somebody,

41:11.672 --> 41:14.141
in some way tries
to help ourselves,

41:14.508 --> 41:17.011
is a soldier in this war.

41:18.546 --> 41:19.914
It's a war on terror,

41:19.947 --> 41:23.284
because these fuckers
are the real terrorists.

41:23.317 --> 41:26.587
You know, bush and kerry

41:26.620 --> 41:28.155
get up on their
campaign platforms,

41:28.189 --> 41:30.124
and they talk about
how they're gonna hunt down

41:30.157 --> 41:32.293
al-qaeda terrorists
and kill 'em.

41:32.326 --> 41:33.928
And kill 'em.

41:33.961 --> 41:35.296
That's what they said.

41:35.329 --> 41:37.231
Hunt them down and kill 'em.

41:37.932 --> 41:39.900
Well, you know, my question is,

41:39.934 --> 41:43.804
you know... what about these
fucking perverts, you know?

41:43.838 --> 41:46.307
Aren't they the real terrorists?

41:46.340 --> 41:50.111
Terrorizing little kids,
driving them to suicide.

41:50.144 --> 41:53.647
Isn't that like murdering them?

41:53.681 --> 41:55.182
Basically?

41:55.216 --> 41:58.119
You fuck with their minds so
much that they can't go on.

41:58.152 --> 42:00.021
They can't really go on.

42:00.054 --> 42:02.256
Isn't that like killing them?

42:02.723 --> 42:04.959
Fucking bastards.

42:07.261 --> 42:08.261
Anyway.

42:09.230 --> 42:12.099
It's a war on terror.

42:12.133 --> 42:13.968
It's like the military.

42:14.001 --> 42:17.872
You know, there's so many
different branches.

42:19.907 --> 42:22.009
There's, like, special ops,

42:22.043 --> 42:25.579
that I'm starting to think
I'm sort of in this war.

42:26.747 --> 42:28.983
There's the medics.

42:29.016 --> 42:31.252
I know some people
who are medics.

42:31.285 --> 42:34.055
The kind of people who are
so cool to be around,

42:34.088 --> 42:37.625
and... make you
feel good about yourself.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.795
Encourage you.

42:42.396 --> 42:44.098
They have their own...

42:44.131 --> 42:47.034
God knows that they have a lot
of their own struggles,

42:47.068 --> 42:51.272
but they try to put those aside
and help other people.

42:51.906 --> 42:53.908
Those are like the medics.

42:55.009 --> 42:56.777
There's people in psyops.

42:56.811 --> 42:59.280
Psychological warfare, I think.

42:59.313 --> 43:01.816
There's the generals,

43:01.849 --> 43:04.752
people who are trying
to coordinate this effort

43:04.785 --> 43:06.854
even now, as we speak.

43:06.887 --> 43:10.825
You know, they're trying to do
what they can to put together

43:11.225 --> 43:14.962
new battles, new court cases,

43:14.995 --> 43:20.101
articles trying to get people
aware of what happened.

43:20.935 --> 43:24.238
It's happening still
in many ways.

43:26.373 --> 43:29.076
So yeah, I think we're
all part of...

43:29.110 --> 43:32.313
We all have our part to play.

43:32.947 --> 43:35.716
And... yeah.

43:39.420 --> 43:40.988
Um...

43:41.021 --> 43:44.191
I got in contact with my sister.

43:44.692 --> 43:50.331
Well I consider her my sister,
because to me she is.

43:50.364 --> 43:55.669
She's not flesh and blood,
but I'm talking about divida.

43:55.703 --> 43:59.039
Everybody calls her davida.

43:59.073 --> 44:02.209
But her name's actually
pronounced divida.

44:03.444 --> 44:05.946
I was actually
with her in Ukraine

44:05.980 --> 44:10.084
when she left, and she really
felt forced to leave.

44:13.487 --> 44:16.056
She could have gone back
to the states, I guess.

44:16.090 --> 44:20.394
She had no money.
The leadership wouldn't let her.

44:20.427 --> 44:21.829
You know, they...

44:23.063 --> 44:25.833
They took that back later
and said that it wasn't true.

44:25.866 --> 44:27.168
But I know.

44:27.201 --> 44:29.003
I was there.

44:29.036 --> 44:33.240
They basically said she couldn't
go to any other home in Europe.

44:33.974 --> 44:37.845
The home that we were in
was basically falling apart.

44:38.412 --> 44:40.848
She was fucking scared.

44:40.881 --> 44:43.083
But I admired her
so much for her bravery,

44:43.117 --> 44:46.453
because she just left,
in the fucking Ukraine.

44:46.487 --> 44:49.356
She would basically have
one meal a day,

44:49.390 --> 44:51.926
sometimes not even that.

44:51.959 --> 44:54.195
Her friends would feed her.

44:54.495 --> 44:56.931
She got into the...

44:58.032 --> 45:00.901
Being a mafia boss' girlfriend.

45:00.935 --> 45:04.205
She almost got herself killed.

45:06.106 --> 45:08.042
Had a fucking hard life.

45:09.176 --> 45:11.979
But she's still going. She's...

45:12.913 --> 45:16.383
Yeah, she's dancing in New York.

45:18.852 --> 45:21.088
Anyway.

45:21.623 --> 45:24.191
She calls me
and sometimes we talk.

45:24.225 --> 45:27.094
And she tells me the stuff
that she's going through,

45:27.127 --> 45:30.264
and... it breaks
my heart, you know,

45:30.297 --> 45:31.765
'cause I wanna help her,

45:31.799 --> 45:33.243
but there's just nothing
that I can do,

45:33.267 --> 45:36.837
because it's all up here,

45:36.870 --> 45:39.406
you know,
the damage has been done.

45:39.807 --> 45:43.444
I'm not saying that she's crazy,

45:43.477 --> 45:46.447
but she has nightmares at night.

45:47.915 --> 45:50.117
I guess a lot of us do.

45:50.150 --> 45:51.418
I have nightmares,

45:51.452 --> 45:54.088
but not really
about the same things,

45:54.121 --> 45:56.824
but about the cult.

45:57.258 --> 46:00.794
She has nightmares about
being dragged out of bed in

46:00.828 --> 46:05.299
the middle of the night
to go have sex with berg.

46:08.002 --> 46:11.805
God damn, I can only imagine
what my sister goes through.

46:11.839 --> 46:14.108
I was telling somebody today
about how different

46:14.141 --> 46:18.879
my sister... this is Christina,
became after the pregnancy,

46:18.912 --> 46:20.948
and just what that did to her.

46:20.981 --> 46:25.286
It was just...
So sad to watch that.

46:25.319 --> 46:28.255
To see her retreat into herself.

46:31.125 --> 46:33.327
And now sue calls me today

46:33.360 --> 46:36.263
and tells me how great
my sister is doing.

46:37.965 --> 46:40.467
That's been actually
one of the hardest things

46:40.501 --> 46:44.305
for me to have to, you know,
pretend that I'm making peace

46:44.338 --> 46:46.140
with these fucking perverts,
you know?

46:46.173 --> 46:49.943
You just wanna grab 'em
and just rip out their throat.

46:49.977 --> 46:52.514
And you know, I gotta be nice.

46:53.213 --> 46:55.550
It started with Gabe and Amy.

46:55.583 --> 46:58.085
Man, they have so much blood
on their hands

46:58.118 --> 47:00.087
it's not even fucking funny.

47:00.120 --> 47:02.189
I hope somebody takes 'em out.

47:02.222 --> 47:04.425
I don't think it's gonna be me.

47:05.359 --> 47:08.128
I definitely don't think
I'm gonna get that far.

47:08.162 --> 47:11.965
But... somebody's
gotta take 'em out.

47:12.366 --> 47:14.001
Those fuckers.

47:15.302 --> 47:19.039
Anyway, yeah, I talked
to them on the phone,

47:19.073 --> 47:21.308
you know, tell 'em about myself,
try to be nice.

47:21.342 --> 47:25.446
You know,
joy, trust, Angela, sue.

47:25.479 --> 47:27.481
Whatever she's going
by these days.

47:27.515 --> 47:30.884
She calls me and,
you know, I have to do

47:30.918 --> 47:32.853
the whole thing again.

47:33.253 --> 47:35.422
So, anyway.

47:36.223 --> 47:37.324
Uh...

47:38.392 --> 47:40.562
She's telling me
that my sister's doing good.

47:41.261 --> 47:42.896
Yeah right.

47:42.930 --> 47:45.032
I was talking
with somebody else,

47:45.065 --> 47:47.901
we were talking about, 'cause...

47:47.935 --> 47:51.372
We sort of left around
the same time, I guess.

47:51.405 --> 47:55.409
She was at my mom's place
for longer than I was, though.

47:55.810 --> 47:57.378
Talking about my sister,

47:57.411 --> 48:01.081
and what a sad little thing
she was back then.

48:02.316 --> 48:05.018
I can only imagine
how bad it is now.

48:06.621 --> 48:09.691
Anyway, my mom's going
to pay for that.

48:09.724 --> 48:13.427
She's going to pay dearly,
one way or another.

48:13.460 --> 48:15.095
If I don't get to her...

48:15.129 --> 48:17.599
If I don't get to her,
and next life goes on,

48:17.632 --> 48:19.601
I'm going to keep hunting her
in the next life,

48:19.634 --> 48:21.101
and let me tell you,

48:21.135 --> 48:23.470
I wanna keep going
until somebody gets her.

48:23.505 --> 48:26.106
I get her. Justice will be done.

48:26.140 --> 48:29.176
Believe me,
it's only a matter of time.

48:29.209 --> 48:32.212
Somehow, someway,
it's gonna happen.

48:32.246 --> 48:34.348
I'm gonna try to do my part.

48:34.915 --> 48:37.050
We'll see what happens.

48:37.084 --> 48:38.952
We'll go from there.

48:41.488 --> 48:44.391
That's what my boss always says,

48:44.425 --> 48:47.961
"we'll see what happens, Rick,
and then we'll go from there."

48:48.630 --> 48:51.131
He's such a cool guy.

48:51.165 --> 48:55.169
He's, like, the best boss
in the world, I think.

48:55.202 --> 48:57.204
That's actually one
of my main regrets

48:57.237 --> 48:59.641
is having to do this.

49:00.642 --> 49:02.710
Having to leave him.

49:03.645 --> 49:07.281
Dessert him, 'cause I know
that he needs me.

49:07.314 --> 49:09.450
He has other guys working
with him, thankfully,

49:09.483 --> 49:12.486
or it would make it so much
harder for me to do this.

49:12.520 --> 49:14.254
But still...

49:15.723 --> 49:17.725
I wrote him a long note.

49:17.759 --> 49:20.662
Tried to explain what I could.

49:22.129 --> 49:25.600
What could he say, you know?
What could he say?

49:27.635 --> 49:29.604
Anyway.

49:30.705 --> 49:33.675
Yup. What can you do?

49:37.311 --> 49:41.215
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
take a break now.

49:41.248 --> 49:45.185
Maybe think of something
else useful to say.

49:56.096 --> 49:57.998
Well, I got my beer.

49:58.700 --> 50:02.035
That helps a bit, I guess.

50:02.504 --> 50:05.339
I'm bringing a six pack
along for the road

50:05.372 --> 50:07.307
in my little cooler.

50:07.341 --> 50:11.245
And hopefully,
before I actually have to go,

50:11.278 --> 50:16.450
I'll be able to... make it
a little more pleasant.

50:20.287 --> 50:22.557
I don't know, though...

50:32.432 --> 50:35.102
One of these fuckers
to the head.

50:39.774 --> 50:45.412
I don't think there's gonna be
much time to feel anything.

50:46.748 --> 50:48.482
Might hurt at first
for a second,

50:48.516 --> 50:53.120
but no more
than cutting your wrist.

50:55.757 --> 50:59.627
So let's hope I don't fuck up
and do something stupid

50:59.661 --> 51:03.163
and blow my nose off instead
of my fucking head.

51:05.800 --> 51:08.135
Well, anyway.

51:08.536 --> 51:09.837
Um...

51:11.739 --> 51:15.442
Maybe fate will smile on me.

51:17.812 --> 51:20.615
The god of war.

51:22.382 --> 51:25.452
The god of revenge.

51:28.623 --> 51:32.125
Maybe they will wish
me happy hunting.

51:33.327 --> 51:34.862
We shall see.

51:37.632 --> 51:39.601
But yeah, I mean...

51:41.468 --> 51:44.338
I guess I said
all I can fucking say.

51:46.340 --> 51:48.208
What can I say?

51:50.511 --> 51:52.179
You know.

51:53.648 --> 51:55.415
What could I fucking say?

51:59.587 --> 52:00.855
Um...

52:01.656 --> 52:07.294
Oh... to have a happy
and peaceful life.

52:07.895 --> 52:10.732
I tried. I did.

52:11.899 --> 52:14.769
Maybe I didn't try hard enough.

52:16.203 --> 52:18.873
I gave it what I could,
you know? I did.

52:19.907 --> 52:22.710
Yeah, should I beat myself up

52:22.744 --> 52:25.813
because I'm not
as strong as other people?

52:25.847 --> 52:28.215
You know, should I berate myself

52:28.248 --> 52:33.453
because I didn't have,
you know, mental stamina?

52:35.489 --> 52:39.794
It's funny, you know,
'cause parts of the Bible

52:39.827 --> 52:43.296
are pretty right on, you know?

52:44.565 --> 52:46.668
Stuff here and there.

52:47.869 --> 52:50.805
I mean there's
gotta be something, right?

52:50.838 --> 52:52.573
Right?

52:53.775 --> 52:59.547
Sort of like a monkey typing

52:59.580 --> 53:04.484
on a typewriter
for all eternity.

53:05.252 --> 53:06.587
All eternity.

53:06.621 --> 53:10.792
He's bound to write
something interesting.

53:12.325 --> 53:13.594
Um...

53:14.829 --> 53:15.963
Yeah.

53:23.303 --> 53:26.641
Yeah, I forgot
what I was gonna say, actually.

53:29.977 --> 53:32.947
Oh, what's that...

53:34.281 --> 53:38.285
What's that verse about?

53:38.318 --> 53:41.488
I try to forget
all those fucking verses,

53:41.522 --> 53:45.026
but they still keep coming up
every now and then.

53:48.261 --> 53:51.899
Luckily they're not
as clear as they used to be

53:51.933 --> 53:54.669
and that brings
some comfort to me.

53:54.702 --> 54:01.776
But I'm thinking about
the ones that, you know,

54:02.910 --> 54:06.013
about fainting in your mind.

54:07.749 --> 54:10.250
What's that verse about?

54:13.353 --> 54:18.760
Oh, a... a... a...
Wounded spirit that can bear.

54:21.763 --> 54:23.831
You know, that kind of thing.

54:24.464 --> 54:29.336
I sort of fainted in my mind,
you know, and...

54:30.505 --> 54:32.439
I can keep going
in the physical.

54:32.472 --> 54:34.474
But, you know...

54:34.842 --> 54:38.478
Do good work,
have a good job, you know.

54:38.513 --> 54:40.615
Fairly nice apartment.

54:41.249 --> 54:44.619
But it's all on the surface.

54:45.720 --> 54:49.724
I fainted in my mind,
and I can't get out of it.

54:50.725 --> 54:52.627
You know, I can't find

54:52.660 --> 54:59.432
the smelling salts
to wake me up, so, you know...

55:05.072 --> 55:07.809
What am I supposed to do?

55:08.543 --> 55:09.911
You know...

55:13.648 --> 55:18.953
So, anyhow, I guess we'll
see what happens.

55:19.153 --> 55:26.060
I hope that, you know,
that you all keep going.

55:26.459 --> 55:30.698
Whoever watches this video.

55:31.999 --> 55:35.803
I hope that it helps
to understand

55:35.837 --> 55:38.906
a bit where I'm coming from.

55:40.541 --> 55:45.046
But I sort of seem
laid back right now.

55:47.949 --> 55:53.921
But Jesus Christ,
anger does not begin,

55:53.955 --> 55:56.991
does not begin
to describe how I feel

55:57.024 --> 55:59.093
about those people
and what they've done,

55:59.126 --> 56:03.097
you know I mean, rage.
I get livid.

56:03.130 --> 56:08.435
You know... it's just a little
closer to the way I feel.

56:09.537 --> 56:12.472
And...

56:13.808 --> 56:16.744
That's gonna feel good
to do some damage,

56:16.777 --> 56:18.980
even if it's not that much.

56:19.013 --> 56:21.616
As far as I can go.

56:22.550 --> 56:24.484
That's what I'm gonna do.

56:24.518 --> 56:27.555
It's going to feel
so fucking good.

56:28.956 --> 56:30.725
Liberating.

56:32.793 --> 56:34.662
So...

56:35.997 --> 56:38.666
Anyway, what can I say?

56:40.968 --> 56:42.637
I guess I said it all.

56:44.538 --> 56:46.540
So...

56:47.642 --> 56:49.043
Yeah...

56:50.044 --> 56:52.546
I guess I'm gonna go now.

56:52.580 --> 56:54.515
I wanted to see
that movie <i>white noise,</i>

56:54.548 --> 56:58.552
just 'cause I'm sort
of interested in the afterlife.

56:58.586 --> 57:00.988
Yeah, it's just a fucking movie.

57:01.022 --> 57:03.591
But... it looked cool.

57:04.091 --> 57:07.161
So... I like movies.

57:08.095 --> 57:09.563
I think that it's 'cause

57:09.597 --> 57:11.198
I wasn't allowed
to watch that many.

57:11.232 --> 57:15.603
Yeah, sure, I watched some
with berg and all,

57:16.237 --> 57:19.140
but... shit.

57:19.941 --> 57:22.977
It's kind of cool
to watch movies now.

57:23.644 --> 57:27.515
So I guess I'm gonna
go watch that one.

57:28.249 --> 57:30.051
Drink some beers.

57:30.851 --> 57:32.520
Be happy.

57:34.622 --> 57:36.791
What more could you want?

57:41.929 --> 57:44.131
Yeah. Well.

57:45.099 --> 57:47.201
I could think of a few things.

57:49.036 --> 57:51.205
I thought how cool it would be

57:51.238 --> 57:55.843
to go hunting for some
child traffickers

57:55.876 --> 57:58.145
that are kidnapping
little fucking kids

57:58.179 --> 57:59.981
down in Indonesia

58:00.014 --> 58:03.551
and some of those
hard-hit countries.

58:03.584 --> 58:06.620
Can you imagine
coming down there

58:06.654 --> 58:11.125
to steal little children
and use them as sex slaves?

58:11.158 --> 58:12.660
To use 'em?

58:12.693 --> 58:16.197
To use their organs? Cut 'em up?

58:16.797 --> 58:20.101
I mean, can you
fucking imagine doing that?

58:20.134 --> 58:24.205
I mean in a way, that's what
these fuckers have done to us.

58:24.772 --> 58:29.777
I mean they didn't actually grab
a knife and cut us up, but...

58:30.211 --> 58:32.646
They fucked with our brains.

58:33.080 --> 58:35.583
Used us as slaves.

58:36.183 --> 58:38.652
And that's what we were,

58:38.686 --> 58:42.623
every last fucking one of us.

58:42.656 --> 58:44.225
Didn't matter how
we were treated,

58:44.258 --> 58:46.961
we were just fucking
slaves, just there.

58:49.230 --> 58:52.133
For those sick
fuckers' pleasures.

58:54.602 --> 58:56.037
That's all it was.

58:56.070 --> 58:59.306
That's all it was
at berg's and mama's house.

59:05.713 --> 59:07.181
All right.

59:08.249 --> 59:09.784
Oh well.

59:10.684 --> 59:12.119
Keep fighting.

59:12.153 --> 59:14.021
Keep the faith.

59:14.055 --> 59:16.724
And all that other stuff.

59:17.358 --> 59:21.829
And someday, in some way,

59:21.862 --> 59:26.133
some of us are gonna be around
to see those fuckers burn.

59:27.201 --> 59:30.671
Literally or figuratively.

59:31.105 --> 59:33.107
They're going down.

59:35.910 --> 59:40.881
And with that happy thought,
I shall leave you.

1:02:29.283 --> 1:02:30.851
Shit.

1:02:42.096 --> 1:02:43.330
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

1:02:43.364 --> 1:02:45.899
Elixcia, it's me.

1:02:49.069 --> 1:02:50.137
<i>Ricky?</i>

1:02:50.170 --> 1:02:51.438
Yeah.

1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:56.343
<i>It's been a while.</i>

1:02:57.344 --> 1:02:58.345
I know.

1:02:59.514 --> 1:03:00.515
<i>What...</i>

1:03:02.550 --> 1:03:05.052
<i>What have you been up to?</i>

1:03:06.020 --> 1:03:10.791
Oh... you know... just working.

1:03:11.325 --> 1:03:14.028
My grandparents
helped me get a job.

1:03:14.061 --> 1:03:15.362
Got an apartment.

1:03:17.898 --> 1:03:19.233
<i>Okay...</i>

1:03:20.934 --> 1:03:22.503
How have you been?

1:03:23.605 --> 1:03:25.105
<i>Um...</i>

1:03:26.106 --> 1:03:27.808
<i>I'm fine.</i>

1:03:28.909 --> 1:03:30.077
Good.

1:03:30.745 --> 1:03:32.980
<i>What's going on?</i>

1:03:34.549 --> 1:03:38.419
Um... I need you to write
something down for me.

1:03:38.452 --> 1:03:42.056
<i>Oh... okay. Hold on.</i>

1:03:46.393 --> 1:03:47.995
<i>Okay.</i>

1:03:48.630 --> 1:03:53.267
Um... it's 519,

1:03:53.668 --> 1:03:58.372
los altos, apartment 343,

1:03:58.573 --> 1:04:01.609
in Tucson, Arizona.

1:04:05.079 --> 1:04:07.915
I need you to call the police

1:04:07.948 --> 1:04:10.284
and give them that address.

1:04:11.218 --> 1:04:12.920
<i>Ricky?</i>

1:04:12.953 --> 1:04:15.590
I need you to tell them
to go to that address

1:04:15.623 --> 1:04:18.593
and tell them that
they'll find a dead body.

1:04:18.626 --> 1:04:20.127
<i>Ricky!</i>

1:04:20.729 --> 1:04:22.630
<i>What happened? Are you okay?</i>

1:04:22.664 --> 1:04:24.198
I'm fine.

1:04:24.231 --> 1:04:26.900
I'm in my car my cellphone
battery is about to die.

1:04:26.934 --> 1:04:31.071
I'm gonna have to stop and grab
a charger or something.

1:04:31.105 --> 1:04:32.973
Just call the cops.

1:04:33.006 --> 1:04:35.175
And I'll call
you back in a little while.

1:04:35.209 --> 1:04:36.578
<i>Wait!</i>

1:04:36.611 --> 1:04:37.611
I'll call you back.

1:04:40.481 --> 1:04:42.116
I love you.

1:06:09.102 --> 1:06:10.103
<i>Ricky!</i>

1:06:10.137 --> 1:06:11.405
Yeah. Hey.

1:06:12.306 --> 1:06:14.241
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1:06:14.809 --> 1:06:16.778
Yeah, I guess so.

1:06:16.811 --> 1:06:19.213
Good as I can be, you know, I...

1:06:19.547 --> 1:06:21.549
Stopped and got a phone
charger for the car.

1:06:21.583 --> 1:06:26.119
So I should be good for the
night or... whenever I stop.

1:06:26.153 --> 1:06:28.288
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:06:28.923 --> 1:06:31.325
Um, on the highway,
heading west.

1:06:32.125 --> 1:06:33.695
Or to California.

1:06:34.729 --> 1:06:36.463
<i>What happened?</i>

1:06:37.197 --> 1:06:40.200
Did you call the police
and tell them where to go?

1:06:40.835 --> 1:06:44.104
<i>Yeah. But... I don't
know what they're gonna do.</i>

1:06:44.137 --> 1:06:45.540
<i>They didn't seem really helpful</i>

1:06:45.573 --> 1:06:48.141
<i>since I told them
it was in Tucson.</i>

1:06:50.545 --> 1:06:52.814
You called
the Washington police?

1:06:52.847 --> 1:06:55.449
<i>It... yeah.</i>

1:06:58.553 --> 1:07:02.657
Um... that's okay.
They'll figure it out.

1:07:02.857 --> 1:07:06.093
<i>Ricky... What exactly happened?</i>

1:07:06.126 --> 1:07:09.496
<i>I haven't heard
from you in so long. Please.</i>

1:07:09.531 --> 1:07:11.498
<i>Tell me what happened!</i>

1:07:11.933 --> 1:07:16.771
I... after I left Washington,

1:07:16.804 --> 1:07:18.673
after I left you,

1:07:19.774 --> 1:07:23.410
I... I started
to look for my mom.

1:07:24.278 --> 1:07:25.780
<i>Oh, Ricky.</i>

1:07:26.614 --> 1:07:27.815
Yeah.

1:07:28.016 --> 1:07:30.852
I... I just had to, you know I...

1:07:30.885 --> 1:07:33.487
I couldn't run
from it any longer.

1:07:35.790 --> 1:07:39.326
Someone had to do something.

1:07:39.661 --> 1:07:42.462
Someone had to put
an end to it all.

1:07:42.496 --> 1:07:44.431
The lies, the abuse, mom.

1:07:44.464 --> 1:07:45.767
The whole damn thing!

1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:48.101
A little fucking justice!

1:07:48.703 --> 1:07:50.505
I had to find her.

1:07:50.939 --> 1:07:53.240
Cut off the head of the snake.

1:07:53.273 --> 1:07:56.578
Berg always wanted me
to be the Messiah.

1:07:56.778 --> 1:07:58.378
Guess I found by mission,

1:07:58.412 --> 1:08:01.214
it just wasn't exactly
what he had in mind.

1:08:01.516 --> 1:08:03.851
I mean, I don't know
what that makes me.

1:08:03.885 --> 1:08:05.853
I mean, I never have...

1:08:09.389 --> 1:08:13.661
I came to Arizona because
my grandma and grandpa are here.

1:08:13.928 --> 1:08:16.764
I knew that it was
the only place that my mom

1:08:16.798 --> 1:08:18.666
had ties to in the states.

1:08:18.700 --> 1:08:20.233
I knew it was the only place

1:08:20.267 --> 1:08:22.670
that she would
regularly return to.

1:08:23.905 --> 1:08:25.840
<i>Did you find her?</i>

1:08:25.873 --> 1:08:27.307
I waited.

1:08:27.341 --> 1:08:29.677
I followed up on
whatever leads I could get.

1:08:29.711 --> 1:08:31.445
She's so damn secretive.

1:08:31.478 --> 1:08:34.582
You know, I don't understand
how she can just disappear

1:08:34.616 --> 1:08:36.517
and become invisible.

1:08:36.551 --> 1:08:38.653
I mean, how can
that kind of monster

1:08:38.686 --> 1:08:42.657
just walk the earth
so anonymously?

1:08:43.357 --> 1:08:45.593
<i>I know.</i>

1:08:46.527 --> 1:08:47.862
So I waited.

1:08:48.663 --> 1:08:53.768
I waited, and finally...
I heard she was gonna come back.

1:08:54.102 --> 1:08:57.304
They were gonna have
a gathering for the elders.

1:08:57.805 --> 1:08:59.641
A fucking party!

1:09:00.074 --> 1:09:01.643
I thought it would be perfect.

1:09:01.676 --> 1:09:03.578
I could get mom
and every other fucker

1:09:03.611 --> 1:09:07.447
responsible for all this shit
in one fell swoop.

1:09:08.583 --> 1:09:10.685
At one point I realized that

1:09:10.718 --> 1:09:13.721
maybe just taking care
of mom wouldn't be enough.

1:09:13.755 --> 1:09:16.356
I mean, the family survived
after berg died.

1:09:16.390 --> 1:09:18.860
Fuck, it'll survive
after my mom.

1:09:19.727 --> 1:09:21.261
I was wrong.

1:09:21.294 --> 1:09:23.564
I can't just cut off
the head of the snake.

1:09:24.065 --> 1:09:26.968
The whole fucking thing
needs to be burned down.

1:09:27.001 --> 1:09:30.805
That's the only way
that this will all stop!

1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:34.441
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1:09:35.308 --> 1:09:36.443
No, don't.

1:09:37.344 --> 1:09:38.445
Don't apologize.

1:09:38.478 --> 1:09:41.181
You have nothing
to apologize for.

1:09:41.616 --> 1:09:45.352
We shouldn't have to apologize
for what's been done to us.

1:09:49.957 --> 1:09:51.491
So, um...

1:09:51.959 --> 1:09:56.496
I... while I was trying
to find my mom, I...

1:09:57.197 --> 1:09:59.934
Got in contact with one
of my old nannies.

1:10:00.333 --> 1:10:03.538
- Susan cotton.
- <i>Oh god.</i>

1:10:04.505 --> 1:10:08.475
Yeah, or... whatever name
she's going by now.

1:10:08.876 --> 1:10:12.446
That's one reason why it's so
hard to track these people down.

1:10:13.246 --> 1:10:18.619
Anyway, as fucked up as it is,
it was perfect.

1:10:19.053 --> 1:10:22.489
My mom only communicated
with a couple handlers.

1:10:22.523 --> 1:10:24.959
And son of a bitch,
Susan was one of 'em.

1:10:24.992 --> 1:10:28.495
Hell, I even heard that she
was my mom's number one.

1:10:28.529 --> 1:10:30.464
Her eyes and ears.

1:10:30.898 --> 1:10:33.868
For what she did to me,
I guess it only makes sense.

1:10:34.367 --> 1:10:36.604
She was my ticket.

1:10:40.307 --> 1:10:41.642
<i>Ricky?</i>

1:10:42.409 --> 1:10:43.611
<i>Talk to me.</i>

1:10:47.982 --> 1:10:51.251
Don't ever let anyone tell you
that killing someone is easy.

1:10:53.521 --> 1:10:54.989
It's not.

1:10:56.624 --> 1:11:01.328
It's the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

1:11:03.330 --> 1:11:05.066
All of this bullshit

1:11:05.099 --> 1:11:08.770
that's been building up
inside of me since I was a kid,

1:11:08.803 --> 1:11:10.905
there was
just no more room for it.

1:11:10.938 --> 1:11:13.440
It all just came out at once.

1:11:14.509 --> 1:11:16.309
<i>What happened?</i>

1:11:16.343 --> 1:11:18.445
No, I... I shouldn't, it's...

1:11:19.147 --> 1:11:21.649
It's stupid to put this on you.

1:11:21.682 --> 1:11:23.618
<i>I need to know.</i>

1:11:27.855 --> 1:11:33.426
Um... I met with sue tonight
for dinner.

1:11:33.995 --> 1:11:36.463
I couldn't eat anything
sitting across from her,

1:11:36.496 --> 1:11:40.835
but she had no problem.
Made me wanna puke.

1:11:40.868 --> 1:11:41.936
<i>Ricky.</i>

1:11:42.502 --> 1:11:46.473
So, we
went back to my apartment,

1:11:46.507 --> 1:11:49.677
'cause I wanted to get whatever
information I could out of her.

1:11:49.710 --> 1:11:51.478
To get mom.

1:11:52.180 --> 1:11:54.549
And she started
talking about, um...

1:11:55.016 --> 1:11:57.952
She started talking
about my sister, merry.

1:11:58.318 --> 1:11:59.720
<i>Oh no.</i>

1:12:00.555 --> 1:12:04.759
You know how bad
the family fucked up her life.

1:12:04.792 --> 1:12:06.527
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:12:06.561 --> 1:12:10.097
She started saying all this
shit about how messed up she is

1:12:10.131 --> 1:12:11.833
and how it's her fault

1:12:11.866 --> 1:12:14.769
that she can't move on
and all this other bullshit.

1:12:14.802 --> 1:12:17.470
I... I... I... I just lost it!

1:12:17.505 --> 1:12:19.607
I mean, for all that
they've done.

1:12:19.640 --> 1:12:21.976
They just don't...

1:12:22.009 --> 1:12:23.578
<i>They don't get it.</i>

1:12:23.611 --> 1:12:26.479
Right! They don't
fucking get it.

1:12:27.181 --> 1:12:29.449
I mean,
the entire time that Susan

1:12:29.482 --> 1:12:32.385
was lying on the floor bleeding
she was looking up at me

1:12:32.419 --> 1:12:34.856
like she didn't understand!

1:12:35.455 --> 1:12:37.825
How doesn't she know?

1:12:38.259 --> 1:12:40.995
They did what they wanted,
they ruined people's lives,

1:12:41.028 --> 1:12:44.765
and they refuse to take
any fucking responsibility!

1:12:46.033 --> 1:12:48.669
I just want them to admit
what they did.

1:12:49.070 --> 1:12:50.671
That they were wrong.

1:12:50.705 --> 1:12:53.007
I wanted sue to understand,
but she didn't.

1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:56.744
She died confused,
like I was the bad guy.

1:12:57.745 --> 1:12:59.981
<i>You're not.</i>

1:13:01.582 --> 1:13:03.450
I thought killing Susan would...

1:13:04.151 --> 1:13:08.556
I thought it would make me
feel better, but it didn't.

1:13:09.991 --> 1:13:14.095
It's so hard,
she... she didn't understand.

1:13:16.764 --> 1:13:18.966
I, um...

1:13:19.667 --> 1:13:21.569
I wanted to get
to my mom tonight,

1:13:21.602 --> 1:13:23.938
but I'm just so exhausted.

1:13:23.971 --> 1:13:27.208
I... I... I just
wanna stop thinking.

1:13:27.241 --> 1:13:28.943
<i>Just come home.</i>

1:13:28.976 --> 1:13:30.678
I can't.

1:13:30.711 --> 1:13:31.946
<i>Please.</i>

1:13:35.816 --> 1:13:37.184
I can't.

1:13:37.618 --> 1:13:43.557
I'm so tired. I've been
up for two days, I...

1:13:45.159 --> 1:13:46.627
I need to stop.

1:13:46.661 --> 1:13:48.529
Um... yeah.

1:13:48.562 --> 1:13:49.830
I can't do this anymore.

1:13:49.864 --> 1:13:52.967
I... I... I'm so exhausted.

1:13:53.801 --> 1:13:57.571
There's a rest stop.
I'm gonna pull off.

1:13:57.605 --> 1:13:59.607
<i>Wait, don't go!</i>

1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:00.841
I love you.

1:14:02.410 --> 1:14:03.711
I have to go.

1:14:03.744 --> 1:14:05.012
<i>Ricky!</i>

1:15:13.214 --> 1:15:14.915
<i>Oh my god, Ricky!</i>

1:15:14.949 --> 1:15:16.650
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1:15:16.684 --> 1:15:18.786
Um, yeah... I'm fine.

1:15:20.254 --> 1:15:22.056
<i>Please, Ricky.</i>

1:15:24.125 --> 1:15:26.293
I need to do this.

1:15:27.628 --> 1:15:29.930
After everything I've done,

1:15:29.964 --> 1:15:31.966
everything that's
been done to me,

1:15:31.999 --> 1:15:34.735
it's... it's... it's
the last thing to do.

1:15:35.703 --> 1:15:37.138
I thought I would just...

1:15:37.538 --> 1:15:40.674
Pull off the road to this
rest stop here, but um...

1:15:43.277 --> 1:15:45.546
This place is too bright.

1:15:47.748 --> 1:15:51.018
There's too much light,
I... I don't feel comfortable.

1:15:51.052 --> 1:15:53.020
I don't want to die here.

1:15:53.554 --> 1:15:58.059
<i>I love you... so much.</i>

1:15:59.060 --> 1:16:02.630
<i>I know how hard everything
has been on you.</i>

1:16:04.331 --> 1:16:06.734
<i>I wish you didn't leave.</i>

1:16:06.767 --> 1:16:08.302
I know, it's just...

1:16:10.071 --> 1:16:12.606
There were so many other people

1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:14.875
that got out
who reached out to me.

1:16:15.309 --> 1:16:18.979
So many, even more
on the message boards.

1:16:19.013 --> 1:16:21.882
I just felt this... this burden.

1:16:26.153 --> 1:16:29.290
They still saw me as a leader.

1:16:30.024 --> 1:16:32.893
All that bullshit
that my dad spewed, I...

1:16:32.927 --> 1:16:34.862
I guess some of it stuck.

1:16:36.063 --> 1:16:38.399
I just couldn't do
nothing anymore.

1:16:38.432 --> 1:16:42.169
We need justice and no one else
is gonna give it to us.

1:16:42.736 --> 1:16:46.373
<i>You feel guilty
because you survived all that.</i>

1:16:46.407 --> 1:16:49.810
<i>No! I feel it, too.</i>

1:16:50.044 --> 1:16:52.780
<i>We got through so much together</i>

1:16:52.813 --> 1:16:55.916
<i>and I need you
to get through this.</i>

1:16:58.219 --> 1:16:59.854
You'll be okay.

1:17:01.088 --> 1:17:04.825
You've always been
more adaptive than me.

1:17:06.393 --> 1:17:09.997
The longer I stayed, the longer
I'd be dragging you down.

1:17:11.432 --> 1:17:15.035
You have so much ahead of you.

1:17:18.739 --> 1:17:20.107
I'm sorry I...

1:17:20.542 --> 1:17:23.177
I'm sorry I failed
you as a husband.

1:17:23.210 --> 1:17:25.646
<i>That's not true.</i>

1:17:26.313 --> 1:17:30.217
You shined so bright,
but I brought too much pain.

1:17:31.318 --> 1:17:33.988
This was all just
a matter of time.

1:17:38.359 --> 1:17:41.295
<i>You were always
the stronger one between us.</i>

1:17:44.498 --> 1:17:48.402
<i>When we finally left the family,
everything was such a struggle,</i>

1:17:48.435 --> 1:17:51.305
<i>but you were so strong.</i>

1:17:53.741 --> 1:17:56.110
<i>Remember that first year out?</i>

1:17:58.045 --> 1:18:01.081
<i>We had no idea
how the real world worked.</i>

1:18:01.115 --> 1:18:02.783
<i>We couldn't get interviews,</i>

1:18:02.816 --> 1:18:04.885
<i>because we didn't know
what a resume was.</i>

1:18:07.922 --> 1:18:09.823
<i>And the apartment.</i>

1:18:10.191 --> 1:18:12.259
<i>We were so proud
until we moved in</i>

1:18:12.293 --> 1:18:16.330
<i>and we couldn't understand
why there wasn't any furniture.</i>

1:18:17.998 --> 1:18:20.201
<i>How could we know
it didn't come with any?</i>

1:18:22.336 --> 1:18:25.439
Not to mention it was
the shadiest part of town.

1:18:25.739 --> 1:18:28.409
We're lucky
we made it out alive.

1:18:30.911 --> 1:18:33.714
Keep telling me nice stories.

1:18:38.520 --> 1:18:40.321
<i>I remember...</i>

1:18:40.888 --> 1:18:42.990
<i>I remember the first
time I saw you</i>

1:18:43.023 --> 1:18:45.292
<i>when you moved into the house
in Budapest.</i>

1:18:45.326 --> 1:18:47.895
<i>There was a bunch of us
living there,</i>

1:18:47.928 --> 1:18:50.998
<i>and everyone
was falling all over you.</i>

1:18:51.265 --> 1:18:53.767
<i>You were a celebrity to us.</i>

1:18:55.236 --> 1:18:59.206
<i>But I saw that look
on your face.</i>

1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:02.243
<i>You didn't want to be davidito,
the second coming.</i>

1:19:02.276 --> 1:19:04.878
<i>You just wanted to be Ricky.</i>

1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:09.483
<i>It's probably
a good thing I was so shy.</i>

1:19:09.517 --> 1:19:12.353
<i>Probably would have been
like everyone else.</i>

1:19:13.487 --> 1:19:15.256
<i>But I saw you.</i>

1:19:17.358 --> 1:19:21.962
<i>It took me so long just to talk
to you for the first time.</i>

1:19:22.564 --> 1:19:25.866
<i>Took so much nerve just
to say that lunch was ready.</i>

1:19:28.269 --> 1:19:31.038
<i>Then that night you
asked me to come to your room,</i>

1:19:31.071 --> 1:19:34.908
<i>and my chest
felt like it was in a vice</i>

1:19:36.210 --> 1:19:38.245
<i>and I couldn't breathe.</i>

1:19:42.349 --> 1:19:44.985
<i>But then you were so nice.</i>

1:19:46.588 --> 1:19:48.289
<i>I can't believe how shy you were</i>

1:19:48.322 --> 1:19:50.958
<i>for all the attention
that you always got.</i>

1:19:53.528 --> 1:19:56.330
<i>And we stayed up
all night, and...</i>

1:19:57.898 --> 1:19:59.800
<i>You taught me some card games.</i>

1:20:02.269 --> 1:20:05.973
<i>And we just talked,
and suddenly it was morning.</i>

1:20:07.575 --> 1:20:10.477
<i>It was one of
the best nights of my life.</i>

1:20:13.447 --> 1:20:14.848
Me, too.

1:20:17.117 --> 1:20:19.286
<i>And you topped it off
by sneaking a Rose</i>

1:20:19.320 --> 1:20:21.455
<i>into my pillow the next day.</i>

1:20:24.626 --> 1:20:27.127
I miss you <i>so</i> much.

1:20:29.196 --> 1:20:31.031
<i>I love you.</i>

1:20:33.267 --> 1:20:36.904
All I ever wanted in this world
was to be loved.

1:20:38.673 --> 1:20:40.974
<i>Ricky.</i>

1:20:41.008 --> 1:20:42.009
Come die with me.

1:20:42.042 --> 1:20:43.977
<i>Ricky!</i>

1:20:44.011 --> 1:20:46.548
I'm so scared to die,

1:20:46.581 --> 1:20:49.049
but it's the only thing
that makes sense.

1:20:49.083 --> 1:20:52.186
I can't stand another
day on this earth.

1:20:54.321 --> 1:20:57.525
What do you think happens
after you die?

1:20:58.092 --> 1:21:01.095
<i>I don't...</i>

1:21:04.532 --> 1:21:06.500
<i>I believe in angels.</i>

1:21:09.002 --> 1:21:10.538
<i>After you die</i>

1:21:11.372 --> 1:21:13.474
<i>those angels
are going to bring you</i>

1:21:13.508 --> 1:21:15.543
<i>a feeling of love</i>

1:21:15.577 --> 1:21:18.379
<i>that you've never
experienced before.</i>

1:21:21.482 --> 1:21:23.050
I like that.

1:21:30.090 --> 1:21:31.559
I need to get going.

1:21:32.092 --> 1:21:34.495
I don't wanna die here. I...

1:21:36.130 --> 1:21:39.667
I wish you could be here
with me when it happens.

1:21:42.069 --> 1:21:44.037
- <i>I...</i>
- I know.

1:21:45.439 --> 1:21:47.274
I'm <i>so</i> sorry.

1:21:49.711 --> 1:21:52.045
Baby, I love you so much. I...

1:21:53.715 --> 1:21:56.216
I just want you to be happy.

1:21:56.250 --> 1:21:58.018
<i>I love you.</i>
