Hey.

01:26.801 --> 01:28.267
Here, get the air moving

01:28.300 --> 01:30.200
around me in here
a little bit.

01:30.234 --> 01:32.467
You want me
to fan you?

01:32.501 --> 01:34.467
I don't think
so, Louie.

01:34.501 --> 01:35.968
You see, I left
my palm leaf

01:36.000 --> 01:38.300
back at the hut
this morning.

01:38.334 --> 01:40.968

ALEX:
Hi, Elaine.

01:44.901 --> 01:47.234
Now, you know that I'm
not the kind of mother

01:47.267 --> 01:50.133
who comes in with
boring stories about
her kids, right?

01:50.167 --> 01:52.033
Yes, we've noticed that
about you, Elaine, yes.

01:52.067 --> 01:53.968
And I can't tell you how
much we appreciate it.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.634
That's the one thing I
like most about you,
Elaine, you know that?

01:56.667 --> 01:57.767
BOBBY:
Yeah. Thanks a lot

01:57.801 --> 01:59.000
for not doing
that, Elaine.

01:59.033 --> 02:00.334
Oh, I forgot.

02:00.367 --> 02:03.400
We're only allowed to talk
about hangovers and the Jets.

02:04.467 --> 02:06.767
Hey, did you see
the Jet game this weekend?

02:06.801 --> 02:08.167
No. I was hung over.

02:11.133 --> 02:13.267
Latka, do you like
kid stories?

02:13.300 --> 02:14.767
Oh, yes, I love them.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.334
You know, when I was
five and a half

02:17.367 --> 02:19.434
and I was just so high

02:19.467 --> 02:22.934
and I was so cute,
you could eat me up alive.

02:22.968 --> 02:25.834
Uh, you know, I had these big
cheeks then, you know...

02:25.868 --> 02:27.667
And...
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

02:27.701 --> 02:30.033
You're telling me a kid
story about yourself?

02:30.067 --> 02:32.067
Yes, because you know,
I am a bachelor.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.968
I am the only kid I've got.

02:37.033 --> 02:38.000
Hey, Lou.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.300
Hey, Ton.
Hey, Bobby.
Whatcha say?

02:39.334 --> 02:41.300
Hey, did your sister
get moved in?

02:41.334 --> 02:42.801
Yeah. She's coming
down here pretty soon.

02:42.834 --> 02:44.200
Yeah, I can't wait
to meet her.

02:44.234 --> 02:46.267
Oh, uh, Bobby, I'd
rather you wouldn't.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.200
Why not?

02:47.234 --> 02:48.667
Well, I mean,
if you had a sister

02:48.701 --> 02:50.701
you wouldn't want a guy like you
to meet her, would ya?

02:50.734 --> 02:52.200
( <i>stammers</i> )

02:52.234 --> 02:54.567
Oh, yeah, I'll hang
around the back
till she leaves.

02:55.567 --> 02:56.667
Hey, Alex, I talk to you?

02:56.701 --> 02:57.968
Yeah, sure. What?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.734
Remember when I read you
my sister's letters

02:59.767 --> 03:01.834
and you said if she wasn't
married and from Spokane

03:01.868 --> 03:03.334
you might want
to go out with her?

03:03.367 --> 03:05.434
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, you're in luck.

03:05.467 --> 03:07.801
She's divorced, she's
moved in, and she's
free for lunch.

03:07.834 --> 03:10.300
Uh, uh... Tony, Tony, look, I
don't think it's a great idea

03:10.334 --> 03:12.334
for someone to date
a friend's sister, you know?

03:12.367 --> 03:14.167
Especially an Italian
boxer friend's sister,

03:14.200 --> 03:15.234
if you know what I mean.

03:15.267 --> 03:16.634
Alex, I know what
you're afraid of.

03:16.667 --> 03:18.901
But don't worry about it.
I mean, Monica's all grown up.

03:18.934 --> 03:20.934
She's been married
and everything.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.200
I doubt she's even
a virgin anymore.

03:24.234 --> 03:25.767
So...
Yeah.

03:25.801 --> 03:27.801
I want you to know I
thought about it and
it's okay with me

03:27.834 --> 03:29.100
if you want to go
to bed with Monica.

03:29.133 --> 03:30.767
Uh, Tony...

03:30.801 --> 03:34.234
I better warn you,
this might lead to dinner.

03:34.267 --> 03:35.868
Listen, Alex, I'm only
saying this because

03:35.901 --> 03:36.901
I know you're a good guy.

03:36.934 --> 03:38.934
You'd call her
the next day

03:38.968 --> 03:40.434
stay friends,
stuff like that, right?

03:40.467 --> 03:42.801
I'm beginning to get
a crush on myself here.

03:42.834 --> 03:44.467
Well...
Eh, Tony, excuse me,

03:44.501 --> 03:48.501
but could I please have
a crack at your sister, too?

03:49.501 --> 03:51.467
Don't be ridiculous,
Latka.

03:51.501 --> 03:53.200
Why? I would call her
the next day

03:53.234 --> 03:55.501
and stay friends with her
and all that, too.

03:55.534 --> 03:57.534
Listen, who are you fooling?

03:57.567 --> 03:59.934
I would marry the wench.

03:59.968 --> 04:01.534
Could you come upstairs
for a second, Alex?

04:01.567 --> 04:02.767
Mm-hmm.
So I could talk to you?

04:02.801 --> 04:04.767
There's no privacy
down here.

04:04.801 --> 04:06.734
Boy, what-what
does Alex have

04:06.767 --> 04:08.033
that I don't have?

04:08.067 --> 04:10.634
A big nose and a Green Card.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.000
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

04:17.100 --> 04:18.267
Excuse me.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.200
Uh, could you help me?

04:20.233 --> 04:23.200
I'm afraid
all I give is rubdowns.

04:23.234 --> 04:26.133
I just wanted you to tell me
where my brother is.

04:26.167 --> 04:27.434
Who's your brother?

04:27.467 --> 04:29.033
Tony Banta.

04:29.067 --> 04:30.400
Huh.

04:30.434 --> 04:33.934
I don't allow no family
get-togethers in my garage.

04:33.968 --> 04:36.734
Well, I just want to talk
to him for two minutes.

04:36.767 --> 04:38.133
Give me a buck.

04:40.133 --> 04:42.267
You must be Louie.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.934
How do you know
who I am?

04:43.968 --> 04:47.167
'Cause I only had three people
described to me.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.667
One was good-looking,
one was smart, and one was you.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.133
Well, meow.

04:56.167 --> 04:57.868
Oh, I'm in luck--

04:57.901 --> 04:59.133
a human being.

04:59.167 --> 05:00.801
Excuse me,
excuse me.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.734
Uh, could you tell
Tony Banta

05:02.767 --> 05:04.234
that his sister's here?

05:04.267 --> 05:05.534
Oh, you are Tony's sister?

05:05.567 --> 05:06.667
Yeah.

05:06.701 --> 05:07.734
Well, do you know

05:07.767 --> 05:09.501
that you and I
are forbidden to love?

05:09.534 --> 05:12.701
It's a shame,
it's a big shame.

05:12.734 --> 05:15.033
Because we would have made
beautiful babies together.

05:23.234 --> 05:26.934
I never thought I'd say this,
but don't go away.

05:29.901 --> 05:31.367
Next.

05:50.801 --> 05:53.934
Did I hear someone say...

05:53.968 --> 05:56.467
you were from Spokane?

05:56.501 --> 05:57.801
Yeah, yeah.

05:57.834 --> 06:00.467
I mean, I lived there
for five years.

06:00.501 --> 06:02.100
Were you ever there?

06:02.133 --> 06:03.767
No, no...

06:05.434 --> 06:07.567
Uh, wait a minute.

06:09.968 --> 06:12.234
I was born there.

06:18.701 --> 06:20.968
Uh... ( <i>clears throat</i> )

06:23.434 --> 06:25.100
Uh, Monica Douglas.

06:26.801 --> 06:29.901
Did, uh, you buy
that dress in Spokane?

06:29.934 --> 06:32.267
Uh... yeah, I did.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.267
It's been a long time

06:34.300 --> 06:38.167

from Spokane.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.601
Smooth, Iggy.

Real smooth.

Excuse me.

06:49.801 --> 06:51.767
Iggy.

06:51.801 --> 06:53.801
She went thataway.

06:54.801 --> 06:56.968
Much obliged.

07:00.334 --> 07:03.067
What did you do in, uh, Spokane?

07:03.100 --> 07:06.734
I, uh, played the flute
in the symphony there.

07:06.767 --> 07:07.734
Really?

07:07.767 --> 07:09.534
Yeah. I wouldn't
kid you.

07:09.567 --> 07:12.200
The flute
is my favorite instrument.

07:12.234 --> 07:13.200
Yeah?

07:13.234 --> 07:15.200
Except for the gong.

07:15.234 --> 07:16.400
Yeah?

07:16.434 --> 07:18.234
You mean the <i>gonnnnng?</i>

Yeah. Yeah, I like it, too.

07:24.033 --> 07:25.434
I bet you play great.

07:25.467 --> 07:27.067
Well...

07:28.267 --> 07:29.734
Vivaldi
is my favorite.

07:29.767 --> 07:30.734

Excuse me.

08:08.601 --> 08:11.200
Your attention,
everybody.

08:11.234 --> 08:13.534
I didn't think
it would be necessary for me

08:13.567 --> 08:15.634
to make this rule, but...

08:15.667 --> 08:17.801
no Vivaldi in the garage.

08:17.834 --> 08:19.067
Thank you.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.734
One of these days

08:20.767 --> 08:23.234
I got to get it together
and go to the symphony.

08:23.267 --> 08:25.767
I'm pretty sure
New York has one.

08:27.767 --> 08:30.033
New York has
a great symphony.
Ah?

08:30.067 --> 08:31.601
I'd like to go, too.

08:31.634 --> 08:33.400
Well, uh...

08:33.433 --> 08:35.734
see...

08:35.767 --> 08:38.767
if you think
you're going to go, maybe, uh...

08:38.801 --> 08:42.433
maybe I could sort of tag along.

08:42.467 --> 08:45.100
Well, you don't
have to tag along.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.200
Maybe we could go together.

08:48.267 --> 08:49.701
Huh...

08:49.734 --> 08:52.400
I just got a rush.

Hi, there.
Family pride.

09:05.901 --> 09:07.701
Hey, and this here's
Alex Rieger.
Ah...

09:07.734 --> 09:09.701
And he's got something
to say to you.

09:09.734 --> 09:11.234
Oh?
Hi.
Yeah. Uh...

09:11.267 --> 09:13.467
Oh, yeah, let me
just say, first
that I can't take you

09:13.501 --> 09:14.901
to lunch 'cause
something came up.

09:14.934 --> 09:16.234
Oh, really?
That's too bad.

09:16.267 --> 09:18.167
Well, it's a shame,
but it's okay,
because Alex here

09:18.200 --> 09:19.734
has got something
he wants to say to ya.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.100
Oh, yeah?

09:21.133 --> 09:22.300
I was just going to a-as...

09:22.334 --> 09:23.934
He would like to know
if you would like

09:23.968 --> 09:25.734
to go to lunch with him
today, right, Alex?

09:25.767 --> 09:27.100
You were?

09:27.133 --> 09:28.267

Sure, he was.
Well, I-I...

09:28.300 --> 09:29.400
You really want to go

09:29.434 --> 09:31.601
to lunch with me,
or are you just asking me

09:31.634 --> 09:33.934
because my brother
asked you to ask me?

09:33.968 --> 09:35.334
Huh?
No, no. I was...

09:35.367 --> 09:37.000
TONY:
Uh, Monica,
come on, I mean,

09:37.033 --> 09:38.234
that's insulting to Alex.

09:38.267 --> 09:40.734
He's asking you 'cause
he wants to ask you.

09:40.767 --> 09:43.167
Okay, okay, okay, great.
Let's go to lunch.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.634
Well, are-are you sure
you want to do this, Monica?

09:45.667 --> 09:46.734

Well, uh...

09:46.767 --> 09:47.968
She's sure.
She's sure.
Uh-huh?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.534
Why is everybody
checking everything?
Okay, okay. Let's go.

09:50.567 --> 09:51.534
Sure.
Have a good time.

09:51.567 --> 09:52.968

Okay.
Okay.

09:54.434 --> 09:55.601
Why you all over me for?

09:55.634 --> 09:57.567
Uh, am I here?
I'm sorry.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.501
MONICA:
Yeah?

10:07.534 --> 10:09.033
( <i>giggles</i> )

10:09.067 --> 10:11.167
So, not a bad sublet, huh?

10:11.200 --> 10:12.501
Hey, how much
you paying?

10:12.534 --> 10:13.801
$500.

10:13.834 --> 10:14.801
How many bedrooms?

10:14.834 --> 10:16.801
No bedrooms.
It's a studio.

10:16.834 --> 10:18.133
Air conditioned?

10:18.167 --> 10:19.300
No.

10:19.334 --> 10:20.467
They include utilities?

10:20.501 --> 10:22.133
Uh-uh.
So what do
you think?

10:22.167 --> 10:23.300
You sign the lease already?

10:23.334 --> 10:25.434
Yeah.
I love it.

10:26.634 --> 10:28.968
So, uh, how did it go with Alex?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.834
Fine. Hey.

10:30.868 --> 10:33.400
Ooh, you still got
that great arm.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.167
So, uh, tell me
about your date.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.567
Bet he took you someplace
classy, just like Alex would.

10:39.601 --> 10:41.734
Oh, we went
to a little hamburger place.

10:41.767 --> 10:43.133
Just like Alex.

10:43.167 --> 10:44.968
He never
puts on airs.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.801
So, uh, what did
you guys talk about?

10:46.834 --> 10:49.234
Well, actually, we didn't
talk all that much.

10:49.267 --> 10:50.968
In fact, at one point

10:51.033 --> 10:54.501
Alex said, "I can't
get a pause in edgewise."

10:55.701 --> 10:57.000
Ah. Ah!

10:57.033 --> 10:58.834
What an icebreaker.

10:58.868 --> 11:01.868
So, so when are you guys
going to see each other again?

11:01.901 --> 11:03.400
I don't know. I mean,
he's a nice guy

11:03.434 --> 11:05.334
and everything, but he's
not my type, you know?

11:05.367 --> 11:06.467
Your husband
was your type.

11:06.501 --> 11:08.067
Tony, don't start.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.367
An Electrolux salesman
with every allergy in the book

11:10.400 --> 11:12.033
who painted turtles
for relaxation.

11:12.067 --> 11:14.167
You know, you always
make so much

11:14.200 --> 11:16.834
of that one time
he painted the turtle.

11:16.868 --> 11:18.267
Hey, Monica, listen.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.100
Come here.

11:20.133 --> 11:22.267
You've been divorced
about a year

11:22.300 --> 11:23.901
and you moved
back into town.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.033
You and I, we got a chance
to start off fresh.

11:26.067 --> 11:28.100
Yeah.
So let's start.

11:28.133 --> 11:30.200
Man, you're my sister
and I love you.

11:31.334 --> 11:32.467
Okay.

11:32.501 --> 11:35.033
And you're my brother
and I love you.

11:36.601 --> 11:38.367
Now you're going
to say something

11:38.400 --> 11:40.467
that's going
to drive me crazy, right?

11:40.501 --> 11:42.801
We all got our faults.
I'm messy around the house.

11:42.834 --> 11:44.434
You fall for garbage.

11:46.167 --> 11:48.834
Trust me enough to try
to get interested in Alex.

11:48.868 --> 11:50.634
No, no, not Alex.

11:50.667 --> 11:53.467
But I tell ya, there was
one guy in the garage

11:53.501 --> 11:54.801
who I thought was really sweet.

11:54.834 --> 11:55.868
Alex is the sweetest.

11:55.901 --> 11:56.868
No.

11:56.901 --> 11:59.267
I'm talking
about Jim Ignatowski.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.033
Monica.

12:01.067 --> 12:02.167
Monica!

12:02.200 --> 12:05.000
Not him.
The man's Silly Putty.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.968
The last girl Jim went out with
lived in a forest and ate bark.

12:12.334 --> 12:14.634
Trust me to know
you're attracted to losers.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.434
And Alex ain't no loser,
and I set it up.

12:16.467 --> 12:17.968
And he likes you.
And hey, listen,

12:18.000 --> 12:19.834
let me tell you,
I was worried about that,

12:19.868 --> 12:21.400
because he don't
like just anybody.

12:21.434 --> 12:22.868
Oh, yeah?
( <i>telephone rings</i> )

12:23.868 --> 12:24.968
Hello?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.601
Oh, hi.

12:26.634 --> 12:28.467
Yeah, we were just
talking about you.

12:29.601 --> 12:32.100
( <i>sighs</i> )
Yeah, yeah.

12:32.133 --> 12:34.334
I'd love to.

12:34.367 --> 12:36.334
Oh, it doesn't
make any difference.

12:36.367 --> 12:39.367
We could eat before
or after the symphony.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.601
I'm going to straighten
your life out if it kills me.

12:42.634 --> 12:44.901
Oh, well, listen,
if it's a problem for you,

12:44.934 --> 12:46.534
you know, we could go Dutch.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.300
No, it doesn't have anything
to do with wooden shoes.

12:51.334 --> 12:53.234
Ignatowski!

13:03.834 --> 13:05.100
Excuse me.

13:07.334 --> 13:09.934
If a, uh, Mr. Ignatowski
shows up looking for me,

13:09.968 --> 13:11.801
could you please
give him this note?

13:11.834 --> 13:12.834
Very good, Mademoiselle.

13:12.868 --> 13:13.934
Thank you.

13:13.968 --> 13:15.767
Oh, there he is.

13:17.934 --> 13:19.934
I believe
this is for you, sir.

13:19.968 --> 13:22.367
Is this the bill
already?

13:22.400 --> 13:24.701
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's-it's from the lady.

13:28.734 --> 13:30.767
"Couldn't wait
any longer.

13:30.801 --> 13:34.100
Sorry I missed
you. Monica."

13:34.133 --> 13:35.400
Uh...

13:35.434 --> 13:38.300
I'm sorry, too.

13:38.334 --> 13:40.334
Guess I'll see you
some other time.

13:40.367 --> 13:42.100
Where are you going?

13:42.133 --> 13:44.033
We can't have dinner together.

13:44.067 --> 13:45.234
Why not?

13:45.267 --> 13:47.634
I don't know.
You didn't go into it.

13:47.667 --> 13:48.834
No.

13:48.868 --> 13:51.200
I, uh, see, I wrote this note
when I thought

13:51.234 --> 13:53.100
that you weren't
coming here.
Ah...

13:53.133 --> 13:55.434
But, uh... it's, uh...
it's-it's okay.

13:55.467 --> 13:57.467
Uh... can we take
our table back?

13:57.501 --> 13:59.501
WAITER:
Sit down, Mademoiselle.
Thank you very much.

13:59.534 --> 14:00.868
Right here.

14:00.901 --> 14:02.634
Oh, thank you very much.

14:07.601 --> 14:08.601
( <i>clearing throat</i> )

14:12.634 --> 14:14.267
So why were you late?

14:14.300 --> 14:15.601
Well, ( <i>clears throat</i> )

14:15.634 --> 14:17.634
I, uh, got a note
from Tony

14:17.667 --> 14:20.267
to wait until he brought
his cab back in.

14:20.300 --> 14:23.634
I never got
so much mail in my life.

14:23.667 --> 14:25.501
I can't believe it.

14:25.534 --> 14:27.067
I-I... what did he say?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.601
He was pretty emotional

14:28.634 --> 14:30.601
about us not
seeing each other

14:30.634 --> 14:31.934
after tonight.

14:31.968 --> 14:33.434
I told him not to worry.

14:33.467 --> 14:35.901
It's not like we're
starting a big romance.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.434
Would you like to order
a drink before dinner?

14:39.467 --> 14:42.934
Uh, bring us
your best Chablis.

14:42.968 --> 14:44.801
A glass or a bottle?

14:44.834 --> 14:46.434
I don't want a glass.

14:46.467 --> 14:47.801
How about you?

14:50.367 --> 14:51.934
Please.

14:51.968 --> 14:53.167
Please.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.400
Uh, slow us down
a little, but...

14:56.501 --> 14:58.634
so what?

15:00.501 --> 15:01.934
Ooh.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.300
Oh, I'm sorry,
I forgot to shave.

15:04.334 --> 15:05.634
That's all right.

15:05.667 --> 15:08.400
My face grows hair very fast.

15:08.434 --> 15:11.234
I shave, and it seems like
only a matter of days

15:11.267 --> 15:13.167
before it's back.

15:20.734 --> 15:22.834
It's been a long time

15:22.868 --> 15:24.434
since I've had
to be interesting.

15:24.467 --> 15:25.767
Well, you're
doing fine.

15:25.801 --> 15:26.767
Oh, yeah?

15:26.801 --> 15:27.767
Yeah.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.634
Well, you know...

15:32.033 --> 15:35.634
I don't have much hair
on my body at all.

15:37.133 --> 15:39.100
I mean, uh...

15:39.133 --> 15:41.934
compared to my face

15:41.968 --> 15:44.834
my skin is like
a smooth baby pumpkin.

15:48.167 --> 15:50.300
Uh...

15:50.334 --> 15:53.000
I didn't mean to talk erotic.

15:54.834 --> 15:57.067
Would you like to order now?

15:57.100 --> 15:58.767
Uh...

15:58.801 --> 16:00.968
Can I take the liberty

16:01.000 --> 16:03.133
of... of ordering for us?

16:03.167 --> 16:04.601
Okay.

16:06.267 --> 16:08.667
Uh...

16:11.434 --> 16:16.801
 <i>nous voudrions la foie gras</i>

Boy, you speak French.

16:37.467 --> 16:38.434
No.

16:38.467 --> 16:39.601
Huh...

16:39.634 --> 16:42.467
No, I just learned
what I should order.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.934
Took me all day.

16:44.968 --> 16:46.601
You mean, you did that for me?

16:46.634 --> 16:48.167
That was the easy part.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.934
The hard part
was phoning all over town

16:50.968 --> 16:53.334
trying to find a restaurant
that serves that.

16:54.801 --> 16:55.767
Boy.

16:55.801 --> 16:58.400
Boy, what a guy.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.300
Come on.

17:00.334 --> 17:02.701
No, no, what a guy.

17:02.734 --> 17:04.233
Oh.

17:04.267 --> 17:06.267
You're turning my head.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.767
Oh.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.000
Could I, uh...

17:23.032 --> 17:25.032
see you again soon?

17:25.067 --> 17:26.200
When?

17:26.233 --> 17:28.233
Later tonight?

17:29.934 --> 17:31.901
Okay.

17:31.934 --> 17:33.767
Uh...

17:33.801 --> 17:36.434
listen, I wasn't
going to say this

17:36.467 --> 17:38.267
unless we hit it off--

17:38.300 --> 17:39.934
you know,
really liked each other.

17:39.968 --> 17:40.934
Yeah?

17:40.968 --> 17:42.300
Let's not tell Tony

17:42.334 --> 17:45.434
that we're going to keep
on seeing each other, okay?

17:45.467 --> 17:48.334
You really like me that much?

17:48.367 --> 17:49.601
More.

17:49.634 --> 17:51.934
Don't tell anyone else
in the whole garage.

17:51.968 --> 17:53.434
Wow.

17:53.467 --> 17:54.667
( <i>laughing</i> )

17:54.701 --> 17:56.334
Yeah.

18:07.767 --> 18:09.901
I got to tell you
something.

18:09.934 --> 18:11.534
You make me happy.

18:11.567 --> 18:14.601
I mean, even after
I first met you

18:14.634 --> 18:17.434
and I was alone in my apartment
lining the shelves,

18:17.467 --> 18:19.601
I'd think of you and I'd smile.
Oh...

18:19.634 --> 18:22.701
When I think of me,
I smile, too.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.234
( <i>clears throat</i> )

18:27.267 --> 18:30.767
We're both thinking of me.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.367
Hey, Jim.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.267
What? Huh?

18:38.300 --> 18:40.000
Hey, listen, uh,
something's been bothering me

18:40.033 --> 18:41.367
the last couple of weeks.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.501
I probably should have
said something sooner, but...

18:43.534 --> 18:45.868
Hey, I'm real sorry
I had to stop you
from seeing Monica.

18:45.901 --> 18:48.033
Oh, that's okay.
Nah. Listen,

18:48.067 --> 18:50.400
it's nothing personal
but sometimes you just

18:50.434 --> 18:52.300
got to do what your
head tells you.

18:52.334 --> 18:54.601
So look, I don't blame
you for being sore.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.267
You got every right,
so if you want to,

18:56.300 --> 18:57.801
you plant one right
here, go ahead.

18:58.968 --> 19:00.467
Go on, don't
worry about it.

19:00.501 --> 19:02.267
Plant one right
there, go ahead.

19:05.534 --> 19:06.868
Thanks, Tony.

19:06.901 --> 19:09.234
I do feel a little better.

19:10.667 --> 19:12.501
Now if you'll excuse me,

19:12.534 --> 19:14.267
I got to go see Monica.

19:14.300 --> 19:15.767
Oops.

19:16.801 --> 19:18.834
Ah, Tony, Tony, now,
look, now look, now,

19:18.868 --> 19:20.267
I-I-I know it's none
of my business,

19:20.300 --> 19:21.834
but I don't think
you should interfere.

19:21.868 --> 19:23.834
Now come on, let's go
to Mario's and have a beer.

19:23.868 --> 19:25.000
Come on, I'll
buy, all right?

19:25.033 --> 19:26.634
No, no, no.
I ain't going to Mario's.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.501
All you want to do
is talk some sense into me.

19:28.534 --> 19:30.100
I'm going over to my
sister's while I

19:30.133 --> 19:32.100
still got a full head of steam.
All right,
all right,

19:32.133 --> 19:33.400
okay, okay,
keep your full head.

19:33.434 --> 19:35.734
But let me make
one point here.

19:35.767 --> 19:37.367
Now it's very clear
to an outside observer

19:37.400 --> 19:38.734
that Monica doesn't
have a problem.

19:38.767 --> 19:40.400
Jim doesn't have
a problem.

19:40.434 --> 19:41.934
You're the one
with the problem.

19:41.968 --> 19:42.968
Oh, yeah, Alex?
Yeah.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.033
Let me tell you something.

19:44.067 --> 19:45.434
I blame you
for this whole thing.

19:45.467 --> 19:46.534
What do you mean
you blame me?

19:46.567 --> 19:48.634
If you had more on the ball,
she'd have gone for you.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.634
What are you
talking about?
Huh, I know what you did.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.501
You tried some of that
dry humor on her--

19:52.534 --> 19:55.234
the stuff that nobody laughs,
they just say, "ooh, clever."

19:55.267 --> 19:56.934
Yeah...

19:56.968 --> 19:58.701
Tony, Tony... To...
we're crossing a line

19:58.734 --> 19:59.934
we don't want
to cross here.

19:59.968 --> 20:01.133
Remember, we're friends.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.467
Friends, Alex? We're friends?

20:02.501 --> 20:06.033
You don't think enough of me
to go to bed with my sister.

20:11.300 --> 20:14.467
( <i>flute playing</i> )

20:18.334 --> 20:19.934
( <i>blowing jug</i> )

20:29.467 --> 20:31.467

20:41.634 --> 20:42.567

20:42.601 --> 20:44.567

you couldn't hear.

20:44.601 --> 20:45.767
All right, Jim, hit the road.

20:45.801 --> 20:47.067
I told you to stop
seeing my sister.

20:47.100 --> 20:48.834
Now, I want
you to l...
Just wait a minute here.

20:48.868 --> 20:50.567
You can't come in here
and tell a guest

20:50.601 --> 20:51.868
of mine in my
house to leave.

20:51.901 --> 20:53.534
Yeah? Well, I ain't
leaving till he leaves.

20:53.567 --> 20:57.200
Okay, Tony, but you better
make yourself comfortable

20:57.234 --> 20:59.200
because I sleep over.

20:59.234 --> 21:00.667
Good, Jim. Good.

21:00.701 --> 21:03.868
Of course,
we have a lot of room here.

21:03.901 --> 21:05.434
We'll need
a bathroom
schedule.

21:05.467 --> 21:06.934
You're out, buddy!
You're out.

21:06.968 --> 21:08.434
Tony, w-what
are you doing?

21:08.467 --> 21:09.767
Put him down!

21:09.801 --> 21:11.934
It's Chicago '68
all over again.

21:11.968 --> 21:14.267
I can't stand it
anymore, Monica.

21:14.300 --> 21:17.167
That's no reason to start
acting like a tough guy.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.501
Look at him, Monica.

21:18.534 --> 21:19.767
He's a burnt-out loser.

21:19.801 --> 21:20.934
You know that for a fact?

21:20.968 --> 21:22.234
Come on, you don't even know

21:22.267 --> 21:23.767
what Washington D.C. stands for.

21:23.801 --> 21:24.934
District of Columbia.

21:24.968 --> 21:25.834
See?

21:25.868 --> 21:27.534
Oh, Tony.

21:27.567 --> 21:29.767
Come on, I wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for you two guys.

21:29.801 --> 21:32.467
You told me one thing
and you did something else.
Aw...

21:32.501 --> 21:35.534
Monica, I get... it
ain't right, Monica!

21:35.567 --> 21:37.200
Tony...

21:37.234 --> 21:38.534
I'm tired of this, Monica.

21:38.567 --> 21:39.868
I can't take it.

21:39.901 --> 21:42.234
Can I have a private
word with you?

21:46.167 --> 21:49.367
Tony, do you know how ridiculous
you look right now?

21:49.400 --> 21:51.567
Doesn't he look
ridiculous, Monica?

21:51.601 --> 21:54.567
Absolutely. Not only are you
making a fool of yourself

21:54.601 --> 21:57.167
but your arms are starting
to get tired, right?

21:57.200 --> 22:00.000
Huh? You know, you've
been doing this your
whole life, Tony--

22:00.033 --> 22:01.934
getting yourself
into tight spots

22:01.968 --> 22:03.868
then finding out you were wrong

22:03.901 --> 22:05.934
when it was too late
to know what to do.

22:05.968 --> 22:07.601
So what are you
going to do now, huh?

22:08.634 --> 22:09.767
I don't know.

22:09.801 --> 22:12.067
Do you know, Jim?

22:12.100 --> 22:13.968
Hey, he got himself
into this mess.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.701
Let him get himself out of it.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.934
Hey, you all right?

22:21.968 --> 22:23.601
Well, ( <i>clears throat</i> )

22:23.634 --> 22:26.701
...my shorts are
riding a little high.

22:28.701 --> 22:30.400
Otherwise...

22:31.968 --> 22:34.000
You know, Tony,

22:34.033 --> 22:36.601
I knew someone
like you once.

22:43.501 --> 22:45.567
Is that all you're
going to say, Jim?

22:45.601 --> 22:47.567
I think I made my point.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.801
You understood that, right?

22:50.834 --> 22:51.834
Yeah.

22:51.868 --> 22:53.267
You two on anything?

22:53.300 --> 22:54.968
Yeah, Tony.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.200
We're on threads of hope,
trying to weave us a basket.

22:59.234 --> 23:01.567
I suppose you
got that one, too, huh?

23:01.601 --> 23:04.901
No, I bat
about .500.

23:04.934 --> 23:06.601
That's all right, honey.

23:06.634 --> 23:08.667
I don't get 'em all, either.

23:08.701 --> 23:11.133
Alex says everyone's
making sense but me.

23:12.601 --> 23:14.634
I'm sorry I busted in.

23:14.667 --> 23:17.968
Wow. Listen
to that.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.601
He never does that.

23:19.634 --> 23:21.133
He never apologized.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.334
Well, we're really
maturing here, aren't we?

23:23.367 --> 23:25.100
Huh? Huh?

23:25.133 --> 23:26.601
I really am sorry.

23:26.634 --> 23:28.100
He did it again.

23:28.133 --> 23:29.934
Well, you
get to stay

23:29.968 --> 23:31.734
for dinner
for that one.

23:31.767 --> 23:32.834
I'm really sorry, Jim.

23:32.868 --> 23:36.133
Isn't this
wonderful?

23:36.167 --> 23:38.300
What have we all learned
from this?

23:40.834 --> 23:43.234
Tony's learned he can't pick

23:43.267 --> 23:45.701
who his sister
is going to fall for.

23:45.734 --> 23:48.300
Monica's learned
she can't pick

23:48.334 --> 23:51.167
who she's going
to fall for.

23:51.200 --> 23:54.734
And I think I've learned
the most important thing of all:

23:54.767 --> 23:57.100
I love being lifted.

24:03.167 --> 24:05.734
