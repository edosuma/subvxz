WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND

22:15.048 --> 22:18.652
ABOUT AN EXTREMELY
POWERFUL LEGACY

22:18.652 --> 22:20.987
IS THAT IT HAS
TENTACLES AND ROOTS

22:20.987 --> 22:24.758
THAT ARE SO TIGHTLY
INTERTWINED AND ENGAGED

22:24.758 --> 22:26.993
THAT THEY CAN'T
BE UNTANGLED.

22:26.993 --> 22:31.064
LIKE YOU SAY, MY FATHER
HAD THESE YOUNG LADIES ‐‐

22:31.064 --> 22:33.433
ALLEGEDLY, OF COURSE.

22:33.433 --> 22:34.868
AND THAT
HE GAVE THEM SCHOLARSHIPS

22:34.868 --> 22:38.605
IN EXCHANGE FOR,
WHATEVER FAVORS.

22:38.605 --> 22:41.942
THAT WOULD MEAN COLLEGES
AND CHARITIES

22:41.942 --> 22:43.744
AND GOVERNORS
AND HEADS OF STATES

22:43.744 --> 22:45.946
AND HEADS OF CHARITIES
AND HEADS OF BOARDS

22:45.946 --> 22:47.814
WERE ALL COMPLICIT.

22:47.814 --> 22:51.451
THEY KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

22:51.451 --> 22:53.554
AND WHAT YOU NEED
TO UNDERSTAND

22:53.554 --> 22:56.790
ABOUT REPUTATION
IN THIS TOWN,

22:56.790 --> 23:01.835
THIS LITTLE TOWN
OF SAVANNAH ‐‐

23:01.835 --> 23:05.438
IT'S WORTH MORE THAN GOLD.

23:05.438 --> 23:07.608
WARS WERE FOUGHT FOR IT.

23:09.743 --> 23:11.444
NOW, IN ORDER
TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD,

23:11.444 --> 23:13.113
YOU'D HAVE TO BE
A SCIENTIST,

23:13.113 --> 23:16.650
ONE SKILLED IN OXYGEN.

23:16.650 --> 23:18.384
HERE'S WHAT I MEAN ‐‐

23:18.384 --> 23:21.522
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TAKE NOTES.

23:21.522 --> 23:23.924
TO TAKE ON THE TASK
YOU'RE REFERRING TO,

23:23.924 --> 23:26.893
YOU WOULD HAVE
TO TRY TO DIVIDE AIR.

23:26.893 --> 23:28.729
IT'S WHAT
YOU'RE DOING HERE.

23:28.729 --> 23:30.764
AND IT CAN BE DONE.

23:30.764 --> 23:35.268
BUT IT'S
A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS.

23:35.268 --> 23:37.638
AND IF IT'S DONE WRONG,

23:37.638 --> 23:40.874
YOU WILL WIPE OUT EVERYONE

23:40.874 --> 23:43.710
WHO NEEDS THAT AIR
TO BREATHE.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.983
NOW, WE HAVE BEEN SITTING
IN THAT CELL

23:49.983 --> 23:52.118
WAITING FOR A PHONE CALL,

23:52.118 --> 23:53.486
AND THAT IS NOT A PLACE

23:53.486 --> 23:56.056
THAT YOU WANT A WOMAN
WHO IS AN HEIRESS

23:56.056 --> 24:00.561
TO A VERY POWERFUL LEGACY
TO BE.

24:00.561 --> 24:03.770
NOW, I WANT A PHONE CALL,
DISTRICT ATTORNEY SALLISON,

24:03.770 --> 24:06.840
AND I WANT IT NOW.

24:06.840 --> 24:10.877
WE'RE WORKING ON IT,
MRS. CRYER.

24:10.877 --> 24:12.779
OKAY.

24:12.779 --> 24:15.682
KEEP PUSHING ME.

24:15.682 --> 24:17.117
WELL, RIGHT NOW,

24:17.117 --> 24:20.721
WE'RE GOING TO PUSH YOU
BACK INTO YOUR CELL.

24:24.424 --> 24:27.127
VERY WELL.

24:27.127 --> 24:30.296
MAYBE VERONICA
WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU.

24:30.296 --> 24:32.265
YOU ARE A DUMB BITCH.

24:35.201 --> 24:37.003
OFFICER!

25:03.570 --> 25:04.705
VERONICA.

25:04.705 --> 25:06.106
KATHERYN. KATHERYN.

25:09.610 --> 25:12.546
MRS. HARRINGTON.

25:12.546 --> 25:14.515
‐WHAT?
‐COME WITH ME.

25:14.515 --> 25:16.182
WHERE WE GOING?

25:16.182 --> 25:17.183
RIGHT THIS WAY.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.785
WHERE WE GOING?

25:18.785 --> 25:20.787
I GET MY PHONE CALL NOW?

25:20.787 --> 25:22.956
NOT QUITE.

25:22.956 --> 25:25.458
WHY?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:25.458 --> 25:27.561
WE'VE GOT A PERSON
THAT HAS TO BE IN ISOLATION,

25:27.561 --> 25:28.962
SO YOU'RE MOVING.
RIGHT THIS WAY.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.496
COME ON.
‐ISOLATION?

25:30.496 --> 25:33.266
LADY,
DON'T ARGUE WITH ME.

25:33.266 --> 25:35.435
WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN
OUR PHONE CALLS.

25:35.435 --> 25:37.437
YEAH, I KNOW.
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

25:37.437 --> 25:38.672
YOU TELL THAT D. A.

25:38.672 --> 25:40.541
THAT I WANT MY PHONE CALL
RIGHT NOW OR ‐‐

25:40.541 --> 25:41.842
OR WHAT?

25:41.842 --> 25:43.644
YOU'RE GONNA BURN US UP
WITH FIRE FROM YOUR BOOBS?

25:43.644 --> 25:45.445
OUT OF THE CELL.

25:51.685 --> 25:52.786
HERE WE GO.

25:52.786 --> 25:54.287
MM‐HMM.

25:54.287 --> 25:56.222
JENNIFER UP TO MORE TRICKS.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.525
‐YOU, STAY.
‐WHY ISN'T SHE GOING?

25:58.525 --> 26:00.226
I'M TAKING YOU
ONE AT A TIME.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.803
I'LL BE BACK TO GET YOU,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

26:02.803 --> 26:04.505
WHAT?

26:34.467 --> 26:36.402
YOUR NEW HOME.

26:40.874 --> 26:42.543
THIS IS A SETUP.

26:42.543 --> 26:44.077
WHAT?

26:44.077 --> 26:46.012
YOU DON'T DO THIS.

26:46.012 --> 26:47.280
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
ON THE OTHER SIDE

26:47.280 --> 26:49.282
WITH THE OTHER FEMALES.
THIS IS A SETUP.

26:51.051 --> 26:53.119
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

26:58.959 --> 27:01.267
I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING
IF I WERE YOU.

27:01.267 --> 27:03.737
YOU KNOW HOW THIS GOES.

27:03.737 --> 27:05.138
DON'T TALK TO ME.

27:05.138 --> 27:07.007
MM. MY, MY, MY.

27:07.007 --> 27:10.010
LOOK WHO'S TESTY...

27:10.010 --> 27:12.012
WITH NO TESTICLES.

27:12.012 --> 27:14.615
WELL, I SEE
YOU'VE BEEN ENJOYING SOMEONE.

27:14.615 --> 27:16.382
‐JIM.
‐I'M SORRY, DAVID.

27:16.382 --> 27:19.753
I'LL DO MY BEST
TO KEEP MY HEAD ABOUT ME.

27:19.753 --> 27:22.889
ALTHOUGH, I SEE THAT SOMEONE
MAY HAVE LOST THEIRS OR...

27:22.889 --> 27:24.925
PERHAPS GIVEN IT.

27:24.925 --> 27:28.428
WELL, I STILL LOOK FLAWLESS.

27:28.428 --> 27:30.831
VERONICA...

27:30.831 --> 27:33.299
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING NEW
WITH YOUR HAIR.

27:35.769 --> 27:37.538
HI, SWEETHEART.

27:43.944 --> 27:45.712
YOU'RE NOT
SPEAKING TO ME?

27:47.881 --> 27:49.816
YOU REALLY NEED
TO SIT DOWN

27:49.816 --> 27:53.654
AND STOP TALKING
SO WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS

27:53.654 --> 27:56.222
WITHOUT GIVING THE D. A.
ANY MORE AMMUNITION.

28:05.572 --> 28:08.842
OOH.
MY, OH, MY, OH, MY.

28:08.842 --> 28:10.443
IT DOES TAKE COMMANDS.

28:10.443 --> 28:12.579
DON'T ANTAGONIZE.

28:12.579 --> 28:15.315
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BEAT
HIS ASS, HONEY.

28:15.315 --> 28:17.718
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
HE SEEMS TO GET.

28:17.718 --> 28:19.319
OR, BETTER YET,

28:19.319 --> 28:22.288
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE QUINCY COME
AND DO IT...

28:22.288 --> 28:24.825
AGAIN.

28:24.825 --> 28:26.860
VERONICA,
I'VE ALWAYS TRUSTED YOU.

28:26.860 --> 28:29.495
HMM.
THAT'S FUNNY.

28:29.495 --> 28:31.231
WE NEVER TRUSTED YOU.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.600
YOUR HUSBAND CERTAINLY
SHOULD NEVER HAVE TRUSTED YOU.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.637
AS WELL AS KATHERYN
SHOULDN'T HAVE TRUSTED YOU.

28:36.637 --> 28:39.740
TOUCHÃ©.
YOU KNOW, DAVID,

28:39.740 --> 28:43.009
WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON...

28:43.009 --> 28:46.046
I CERTAINLY NEVER THOUGHT
IT WOULD COME TO THIS.

28:46.046 --> 28:48.615
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE
FOR THIS.

28:48.615 --> 28:49.950
YOU'RE EXERCISING
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

28:49.950 --> 28:51.652
OF RESTRAINT, MY FRIEND.

28:51.652 --> 28:54.921
ESPECIALLY AFTER HAVING SEEN
THE PICTURE IN THE PAPER ‐‐

28:54.921 --> 28:57.223
THE PICTURE OF YOUR WIFE
AND THAT GUY.

28:57.223 --> 28:59.860
WHO WAS THAT GUY,
VERONICA?

28:59.860 --> 29:02.402
JIM, I SAID
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE!

29:04.538 --> 29:06.907
DAVID, FOR A MINUTE...

29:06.907 --> 29:08.575
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU
AND HER WORKING TOGETHER.

29:08.575 --> 29:11.845
BUT NOW THAT
I'VE SEEN THE PICTURE...

29:11.845 --> 29:13.914
I THINK
IT'S YOUR WIFE WORKING ALONE.

29:13.914 --> 29:16.683
IS THAT RIGHT, VERONICA?
ARE YOU WORKING ALONE?

29:16.683 --> 29:18.952
YES. I AM.

29:18.952 --> 29:21.788
I SAID STOP IT,
AND I MEAN IT.

29:21.788 --> 29:23.223
NO, YOU STOP IT.

29:23.223 --> 29:25.692
I'M STILL PISSED THAT
HE PUT HIS HANDS ON ME, DAVID.

29:25.692 --> 29:27.227
AND YOU DEFENDED ME THEN.

29:27.227 --> 29:29.630
WELL, YOU'RE GETTING HARDER
AND HARDER TO DEFEND.

29:29.630 --> 29:31.532
I'M SORRY, VERONICA.

29:31.532 --> 29:34.668
I'M SO SORRY THAT I TRIED
TO CHOKE THE LIFE OUT OF YOU.

29:34.668 --> 29:37.337
I'M SORRY
THAT I GOT MY HANDS

29:37.337 --> 29:41.041
WRAPPED AROUND THAT ADAM'S APPLE
OF YOURS SO LONG AGO.

29:41.041 --> 29:42.776
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOONER.

29:42.776 --> 29:44.444
I'M REALLY SORRY.

29:46.847 --> 29:48.782
AND YOU'RE STILL NOT
GONNA DEFEND ME?

29:48.782 --> 29:50.717
'CAUSE I TOLD YOU
TO STOP IT

29:50.717 --> 29:53.486
AND YOU REFUSED
TO LISTEN. YOU CONTINUE ‐‐

29:53.486 --> 29:57.023
THAT'S BECAUSE I'M WAITING
FOR YOU TO DO SOMETHING, MAN!

29:57.023 --> 29:58.892
DO SOMETHING!

29:58.892 --> 30:00.226
STOP BEING HIS FLUNKY.

30:00.226 --> 30:02.468
YOU'RE NOT HIS ERRAND BOY.
STOP IT!

30:02.468 --> 30:04.270
DAVID...

30:19.285 --> 30:22.422
THERE YOU GO ‐‐
ONE BIG FAMILY REUNION.

30:29.763 --> 30:31.131
Veronica: JEFFERY?

30:35.969 --> 30:37.771
MOM?

30:37.771 --> 30:39.372
SON.

30:39.372 --> 30:41.908
DAD?

30:41.908 --> 30:43.143
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

30:43.143 --> 30:46.046
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

30:46.046 --> 30:47.648
DID SHE HAVE YOU ARRESTED?

30:47.648 --> 30:49.249
‐WHO?
‐THE D. A.

30:49.249 --> 30:51.051
UH, NO.

30:51.051 --> 30:53.419
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:53.419 --> 30:56.890
I, UH...

30:56.890 --> 30:59.392
JEFFERY?

30:59.392 --> 31:02.468
JEFFERY.
‐SPEAK, SON.

31:04.204 --> 31:05.238
I GOT ARRESTED.

31:05.238 --> 31:06.907
WELL, I CAN SEE THAT.

31:06.907 --> 31:09.776
WHAT WAS THE CHARGE?

31:09.776 --> 31:11.311
DUI.

31:11.311 --> 31:14.014
‐OH, JEFFERY.
‐HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

31:16.783 --> 31:18.985
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHY ARE YOU HERE, MOM?

31:24.858 --> 31:27.093
RIGHT.

31:27.093 --> 31:30.296
AT LEAST FOR ME,
I HAVE BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED.

31:30.296 --> 31:32.132
YEAH. RIGHT.

31:34.300 --> 31:36.069
DRINKING AND DRIVING.

31:36.069 --> 31:38.204
LYING...

31:38.204 --> 31:39.372
MANIPULATING...

31:39.372 --> 31:42.442
ALL RIGHT, SON, ENOUGH.

31:42.442 --> 31:45.879
WE ARE TALKING GUILTY.

31:45.879 --> 31:49.816
YOU'RE GETTING
BESIDE YOURSELF.

31:49.816 --> 31:52.586
THE APPLE DOESN'T FALL TOO FAR
FROM THE TREE, MOM.

31:52.586 --> 31:54.988
OH, OKAY.

31:54.988 --> 31:56.557
WELL, I WILL SHOW YOU.

31:56.557 --> 31:59.760
SHUT UP.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.367
YOU HAVE NOTHING ON ME.

32:01.367 --> 32:04.905
JUST SHUT UP.

32:04.905 --> 32:07.508
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE,

32:07.508 --> 32:10.644
YOU WILL REGRET EVER
TALKING TO ME THAT WAY.

32:14.881 --> 32:17.584
WHEN WE GET OUT OF HERE,

32:17.584 --> 32:21.054
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET EVERYTHING
YOU EVER DID TO ME.

32:25.892 --> 32:28.629
I ALWAYS
HAVE THE UPPER HAND.

32:28.629 --> 32:31.665
REMEMBER THAT.

32:31.665 --> 32:34.835
DO YOU?

32:34.835 --> 32:36.970
WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

32:36.970 --> 32:39.573
HMM?

32:39.573 --> 32:42.042
A DESK...

32:42.042 --> 32:44.811
SCRAPED KNEES...

32:44.811 --> 32:47.247
FROM BEING
ON A RAGGEDY OLD FLOOR

32:47.247 --> 32:50.817
AT A JUNKYARD.

32:50.817 --> 32:54.454
WOW.
WERE THE HELL IS THIS GOING?

32:54.454 --> 32:57.490
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO GO THERE WITH ME?

32:57.490 --> 32:59.693
SHALL WE?

32:59.693 --> 33:03.036
DO YOU WANT TO TELL DAD
OR SHALL I?

33:03.036 --> 33:05.906
TELL ME WHAT?

33:05.906 --> 33:09.242
NO,
YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD.

33:09.242 --> 33:10.844
DON'T PUSH ME.

33:10.844 --> 33:12.646
GO ON.

33:20.521 --> 33:23.089
I'M HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH A YOUNG MAN.

33:23.089 --> 33:27.828
APPARENTLY JEFFERY
KNOWS ABOUT IT.

33:27.828 --> 33:30.230
PROBABLY SAW IT
IN THE PAPER.

33:30.230 --> 33:31.397
PAPER?

33:31.397 --> 33:32.799
YES.
IT'S IN THE PAPER.

33:32.799 --> 33:35.235
DID YOU SEE IT?

33:35.235 --> 33:37.904
I'M SURE...

33:37.904 --> 33:40.006
I'M SURE YOUR FATHER HAS.

33:45.078 --> 33:49.282
SO, GO ON.
MAKE YOUR POWER MOVE...

33:49.282 --> 33:50.651
AND HURT YOUR FATHER.

33:50.651 --> 33:53.887
YOU HURT HIM.
YOU HURT HIM.

33:53.887 --> 33:56.356
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TURN THIS AROUND ON ME.

33:56.356 --> 33:58.091
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO HIM.
YOU DID.

33:58.091 --> 34:01.735
OH, YOU JUST WANT TO DO WYATT
AND ANY OTHER MAN.

34:01.735 --> 34:05.305
YES, I DO.

34:05.305 --> 34:08.274
AND I WISH THERE WAS ONE
IN HERE RIGHT NOW.

34:08.274 --> 34:10.376
I WOULD DO IT
IN YOUR FACE

34:10.376 --> 34:12.378
AND FORCE YOU TO WATCH IT.

34:21.855 --> 34:24.725
OKAY, JEFFERY.

34:24.725 --> 34:26.527
WELL, I'VE TRIED
TO BE NICE.

34:30.396 --> 34:33.099
SON...

34:33.099 --> 34:36.603
WHO IS THAT
IN THE PICTURE?

34:36.603 --> 34:39.706
DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?

34:39.706 --> 34:41.508
JEFFERY...

34:45.879 --> 34:47.413
NO. I DON'T.

34:49.482 --> 34:51.117
I THINK YOU DO.

34:51.117 --> 34:52.786
I SAID I DON'T.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.588
ARE YOU SURE?

35:02.035 --> 35:04.838
WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE...

35:04.838 --> 35:08.909
I THINK I WILL SLEEP
WITH MAGGIE DAY AFTER ALL.

35:08.909 --> 35:11.077
AND THAT WILL MAKE US EVEN.

35:11.077 --> 35:13.213
NO, IT WON'T.

35:13.213 --> 35:16.482
BUT IT WILL MAKE US OVER.

35:16.482 --> 35:19.485
