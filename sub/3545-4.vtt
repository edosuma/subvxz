00:00.208 --> 00:01.291
Anybody home?

00:01.375 --> 00:04.375
<i>Previously, on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:04.458 --> 00:07.208
<i>- Susan played with fire...</i>
- That's not my cup.

00:07.291 --> 00:08.583
<i>And could get burned.</i>

00:08.709 --> 00:11.375
Go to a spa, go shopping.
Find a way to relax.

00:11.458 --> 00:15.709
<i>- Gabrielle...found herself a playmate.</i>
- Get here as fast as you can.

00:15.834 --> 00:19.166
<i>Lynette couldn't get her kids</i>
<i>to stop playing.</i>

00:19.250 --> 00:21.959
- You know why I pulled you over?
- I have a theory.

00:22.041 --> 00:26.709
If I don't get some sleep, I'll be
forced back upstairs out of exhaustion.

00:26.792 --> 00:29.166
<i>And Bree played hard ball.</i>

00:29.291 --> 00:32.041
<i>Everyone has a little dirty laundry.</i>

00:35.667 --> 00:40.083
<i>When I was alive, I maintained</i>
<i>many different identities.</i>

00:40.166 --> 00:44.166
<i>Lover, wife and, ultimately, victim.</i>

00:45.208 --> 00:50.375
<i>Yes, labels are important to the living.</i>
<i>They dictate how people see themselves.</i>

00:50.500 --> 00:52.250
<i>Like my friend Lynette.</i>

00:52.375 --> 00:57.000
<i>She used to see herself as a career</i>
<i>woman, and a hugely successful one.</i>

00:59.041 --> 01:01.875
<i>She was known for her power lunches,</i>

01:01.959 --> 01:04.041
<i>her eye-catching presentations,</i>

01:04.166 --> 01:07.750
<i>and her ruthlessness</i>
<i>in wiping out the competition.</i>

01:08.875 --> 01:12.375
<i>But Lynette </i>gave <i>up</i>
<i>her career to assume a new label.</i>

01:12.458 --> 01:17.542
<i>The incredibly satisfying role</i>
<i>of full-time mother.</i>

01:20.333 --> 01:23.583
Scavo residence. Yes, this is me.

01:27.792 --> 01:29.959
<i>But, unfortunately for Lynette,</i>

01:30.083 --> 01:34.834
<i>this new label frequently</i>
<i>fell short of what was advertised.</i>

01:38.375 --> 01:41.208
How in the world did they...?

01:41.291 --> 01:45.041
I left the door to the art supply
cupboard open for five minutes.

01:45.125 --> 01:47.417
That's all. Five minutes.

01:47.542 --> 01:51.166
The little girl,
why didn't she say anything?

01:51.250 --> 01:53.834
Your boys work quickly.

01:53.917 --> 01:58.417
Well, obviously they will be
punished for this severely.

01:58.500 --> 02:03.000
I hesitate bringing this up, since you
got so ugly about it last time...

02:03.083 --> 02:05.625
They don't have
Attention Deficit Disorder,

02:05.709 --> 02:10.000
and I won't drug my boys
just to make your job easier.

02:10.125 --> 02:11.959
I'd rather change teachers.

02:12.083 --> 02:16.667
They're in my class because I'm
the only teacher who can handle them.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.166
What if we separate the twins,
put them in different classes?

02:22.250 --> 02:25.542
They're calmer when they're not
bouncing off one another.

02:25.625 --> 02:28.750
We can try that,
but if it doesn't work,

02:28.875 --> 02:32.959
we may no longer
be able to accommodate them.

02:33.083 --> 02:35.709
<i>It suddenly occurred to Lynette,</i>

02:35.792 --> 02:38.291
<i>her label was about</i>
<i>to change yet again.</i>

02:39.083 --> 02:43.000
<i>And for the next few years,</i>
<i>she would be known as</i>

02:43.125 --> 02:48.625
<i>the mother of the boys</i>
<i>who painted Tiffany Axelrod blue.</i>

03:38.542 --> 03:42.792
<i>It looked to be an interesting</i>
<i>afternoon on Wisteria Lane.</i>

03:42.917 --> 03:47.083
<i>A mysterious cassette tape had been</i>
<i>discovered by my friend Bree.</i>

03:47.166 --> 03:49.834
<i>She had stolen it</i>
<i>from her marriage counselor.</i>

03:49.917 --> 03:54.750
<i>A counselor I'd once spoken to</i>
<i>in strictest confidence.</i>

03:55.417 --> 03:56.792
<i>How have you been?</i>

03:56.875 --> 04:00.208
<i>- I had the nightmare again.</i>
- It's weird to hear Mary Alice.

04:00.291 --> 04:02.792
<i>- Still the same one?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

04:02.875 --> 04:08.917
<i>But this time I was standing in a river</i>
<i>and I saw the girl under the water.</i>

04:08.959 --> 04:12.583
<i>She kept screaming "Angela"</i>
<i>over and over again.</i>

04:12.709 --> 04:16.959
<i>What do you think the significance</i>
<i>of the name "Angela" is?</i>

04:17.083 --> 04:20.250
<i>Actually, that's my real name.</i>

04:20.375 --> 04:21.792
Her real name?

04:23.250 --> 04:27.500
I've seen her driver's license.
It did not say Angela.

04:27.583 --> 04:31.125
- What does the rest of the tape say?
- More about her nightmares,

04:31.208 --> 04:33.750
and this girl she was afraid of.

04:33.875 --> 04:37.083
So what the hell do we do now?

04:47.583 --> 04:49.875
I think we should show Paul the note.

04:49.959 --> 04:52.291
Are you sure? He's gonna freak.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.750
It's now or never.

04:53.834 --> 04:58.625
I saw what he's asking for the place.
It's gonna sell quickly.

04:58.709 --> 05:01.625
Can I say something?

05:01.750 --> 05:03.959
- I'm glad Paul's moving.
- Gabby.

05:04.125 --> 05:07.250
I'm sorry. He's just always
given my the creeps.

05:07.333 --> 05:11.458
Haven't you guys noticed,
he has this dark thing going on?

05:11.542 --> 05:13.667
Something about him just feels...

05:13.792 --> 05:16.375
- Malignant?
- Yes.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.834
We've all sort of felt it.

05:24.208 --> 05:27.375
That being said, I do love
what he's done with that lawn.

05:42.125 --> 05:44.208
Mom, the dish is clean.

05:46.500 --> 05:50.709
I don't understand why you don't just
ask him out on an "official date" date.

05:50.792 --> 05:53.917
I'm trying a new strategy.
I'm playing hard to get.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.917
- How long can keep that up?
- Maybe until noon.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.291
Then I'm going to have to run over there
and beg him to love me.

06:02.166 --> 06:06.709
Mom, I don't think you're
gonna be able to wait that long.

06:09.125 --> 06:12.458
You got to be kidding.
She washed her car yesterday.

06:24.458 --> 06:27.041
Oh, no, she's not.

06:28.417 --> 06:31.917
Yep, she's bringing out the big guns.

06:42.709 --> 06:45.458
You better get over there.
She's wearing cotton.

06:48.041 --> 06:51.625
What do I say? "I saw you
half-naked and I thought I'd drop by"?

06:51.709 --> 06:54.834
- What's that?
- Mike's junk mail we got by mistake.

06:54.917 --> 06:58.834
I held onto it
in case of an emergency.

06:58.917 --> 07:00.750
God bless you.

07:14.250 --> 07:17.125
- Hi.
- Hey, Susan.

07:17.208 --> 07:19.750
We got this by mistake.

07:19.834 --> 07:21.792
Thanks.

07:23.208 --> 07:24.792
I hope it's not important.

07:24.875 --> 07:29.041
No, it's just a promotion
for the film festival at the Rialto.

07:31.375 --> 07:35.500
Well, I guess I've done
my good deed for the day.

07:37.041 --> 07:39.083
I'll just head back home.

07:41.208 --> 07:44.125
Bye.

07:44.208 --> 07:47.166
- Hey, you like old movies?
- I love old movies.

07:56.291 --> 07:57.959
I hate Susan Mayer.

07:58.041 --> 08:02.291
Every time I see those big doe eyes
of hers, I swear to God

08:02.375 --> 08:05.041
I just want to go out and shoot a deer.

08:05.125 --> 08:07.125
What has she done this time?

08:07.208 --> 08:12.333
She is out there throwing herself
at Mike Delfino, again.

08:12.458 --> 08:18.959
- Susan likes Mike?
- Where the hell have you been, Martha?

08:19.083 --> 08:23.333
She's been lusting after him
ever since he moved in.

08:30.667 --> 08:33.083
I got your message. What's going on?

08:33.166 --> 08:35.417
The boys refuse to be separated.

08:35.500 --> 08:39.500
They refuse?
They're six years old. Make them.

08:40.417 --> 08:44.667
The school regulations are pretty strict
about me wrestling with the boys.

08:44.792 --> 08:48.667
But if you want to give it a shot,
be my guest.

08:48.792 --> 08:50.917
Fine.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.750
Which one goes
and which one stays?

08:56.834 --> 08:59.041
You pick.

09:06.542 --> 09:09.291
Come on now. Stop it! No. No.

09:14.542 --> 09:17.166
I'm gonna take the whole table.
That's right.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.500
Come on now. I mean it.

09:26.041 --> 09:29.375
I love taking baths.
Especially with you.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.667
It's like taking a vacation
from the world.

09:32.750 --> 09:35.250
I hated taking baths when I was a kid.

09:35.375 --> 09:39.750
Of course, back then, the only thing
I had to play with was my rubber ducky.

09:41.125 --> 09:43.500
Who's that? It's Mr. Solis.

09:45.083 --> 09:49.000
Relax. Carlos is at work
and he doesn't ring the doorbell.

09:56.333 --> 09:59.625
It's the cable guy.
He's three hours late.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.000
Use the side entrance.

10:03.083 --> 10:06.667
<i>Gabrielle knew her vacation</i>
<i>from the world had ended.</i>

10:06.750 --> 10:12.291
<i>What she didn't know was</i>
<i>John had left behind a souvenir.</i>

10:14.875 --> 10:17.208
Dad didn't come home last night.

10:17.291 --> 10:19.959
- They had a fight. A bad one.
- How bad?

10:20.083 --> 10:22.250
Like divorce court bad.

10:26.709 --> 10:30.542
Listen to her. She always
overcompensates when she's worried.

10:30.625 --> 10:34.625
If Dad moves out and leaves us
with her, I'll lose my mind.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.792
Dinner is on the table.

10:39.875 --> 10:42.417
Mom, where did Dad go last night?

10:42.500 --> 10:47.542
He got a last minute call to speak at
a medical conference in Philadelphia.

10:47.625 --> 10:49.125
Take your seats.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.583
This marriage is so over.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.166
Andrew?

11:13.583 --> 11:16.500
Sorry I was late.
The scheduler overbooked me.

11:16.583 --> 11:19.125
- How long are you going to be?
- Almost done.

11:19.208 --> 11:23.041
What is that scent? Is that sage
and citrus? That's amazing.

11:23.125 --> 11:26.667
Try to hurry. I have stuff to do.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.166
Come on.

11:50.083 --> 11:51.875
What's happening?

11:51.959 --> 11:56.166
The cable guy fell. He hit his head
on the tub. He may have a concussion.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.917
- It's almost eight.
- He was late.

12:20.542 --> 12:23.792
- Mrs. Huber.
- Hello, Susan. I made you a pie.

12:25.709 --> 12:26.709
Why?

12:26.792 --> 12:29.208
Do I need a motive
to do something nice?

12:32.417 --> 12:35.333
I can't wait for you to try this.
It's mincemeat.

12:35.417 --> 12:40.542
- Actually, I just had dinner.
- That's OK. You can save it for later.

12:42.959 --> 12:44.417
What's so funny?

12:44.500 --> 12:48.583
I was just thinking of that expression,
"I'll make mincemeat out of you".

12:48.667 --> 12:52.250
Mincemeat used to be
an entrée of mostly chopped meat,

12:52.375 --> 12:53.875
so it was like saying,

12:53.959 --> 12:58.750
"I'll chop you up into little bits."
But that was centuries ago.

12:58.875 --> 13:04.792
Today, mincemeat is mostly made
of fruit, spices and rum.

13:04.917 --> 13:09.667
There's no meat in it and still people
say, "I'll make mincemeat out of you."

13:09.750 --> 13:13.917
- People don't really say that anymore.
- I do.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.250
- So, Susan, how are you?
- I'm fine.

13:18.375 --> 13:24.041
Good. You know,
I have a confession to make.

13:24.125 --> 13:27.208
I wish I'd been more
supportive when Karl left you.

13:27.291 --> 13:31.583
You don't have to apologize about Karl.
Really, Karl and I are over.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.709
- I've moved on.
- I know.

13:33.792 --> 13:39.041
You've moved on to that nice Mike
Delfino. He's quite a catch, isn't he?

13:40.834 --> 13:45.083
- You like him, don't you?
- Sure, as a friend.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.625
Being coy is a strategy best employed
by virgins at their first dance.

13:52.709 --> 13:56.375
For women of our age,
it's just annoying.

13:57.959 --> 14:01.333
- You sure you don't want pie?
- No, thank you.

14:01.417 --> 14:06.583
I hope it works out with you and Mike.
You've been so desperate to land him.

14:06.667 --> 14:09.750
What? I am not desperate.

14:09.834 --> 14:13.125
Good lord, Susan,
you burned your rival's house down.

14:13.208 --> 14:17.875
If that isn't desperate,
I don't know what is.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.583
Mrs. Huber, with all due respect,
you're crazy.

14:28.959 --> 14:32.166
- What's that?
- I think you recognize it.

14:32.250 --> 14:34.750
I found it in the ruins of Edie's home.

14:39.208 --> 14:42.834
- Well, that's not...
- My point is this.

14:42.917 --> 14:45.917
I wasn't there for you when Karl left,
but I am now.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.083
As far as I'm concerned,
this is our secret.

14:49.208 --> 14:51.750
And no one ever need know.

14:54.959 --> 14:58.542
You don't know how good it feels
to finally be able to help you.

15:00.458 --> 15:03.542
You look so pale.

15:03.625 --> 15:07.792
Now, I insist you try some of my pie.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.458
Go on.

15:15.875 --> 15:18.500
Did I mention it's mincemeat?

15:29.917 --> 15:32.667
- Open the door, please.
- Hang on.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.917
- What?
- May I come in?

15:36.041 --> 15:38.208
- No.
- I want to talk to you.

15:38.333 --> 15:42.625
- Then talk.
- Where were you last night?

15:43.750 --> 15:46.417
- Brian's.
- I just spoke to Brian's mother.

15:46.542 --> 15:50.125
Tell me again where you were,
and this time don't lie to me.

15:52.041 --> 15:55.959
Where did you say Dad
was again? In Philadelphia?

15:56.041 --> 15:57.917
Don't change the subject.

15:57.959 --> 16:00.542
Sorry, I thought
the subject was telling lies.

16:00.625 --> 16:03.959
I called Dad's cell phone.
I know he moved out.

16:05.542 --> 16:08.208
Well, it's just temporary and...

16:09.583 --> 16:11.667
...I thought it would upset you.

16:11.750 --> 16:13.375
Whatever. You lied.

16:13.458 --> 16:17.000
So stop pretending like you
have some sort of moral authority.

16:17.125 --> 16:19.667
Just because I don't share
my problems with you

16:19.792 --> 16:21.834
doesn't give you the right to be rude.

16:21.959 --> 16:26.250
How about driving my father away.
Do I get to be rude then?

17:12.166 --> 17:14.709
- Hi.
- What's this?

17:14.834 --> 17:17.083
- It's a sock.
- It's a man's sock.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.667
I found it under our bed.
It's not mine.

17:19.750 --> 17:23.166
For God sakes, Carlos,
it's Yao Lin's.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.375
Our maid wears size 13 gym socks?

17:25.458 --> 17:27.667
No, she dusts with them.

17:34.458 --> 17:37.834
See? Socks instead of rags.

17:57.291 --> 18:01.417
- Susan, hello.
- Mrs. Huber.

18:02.083 --> 18:05.875
Did you and Mike come together?
I saw him in the fresh produce aisle.

18:05.959 --> 18:08.250
No. Like I told you.
We're just friends.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.667
By the way, if I didn't
make it clear yesterday,

18:14.750 --> 18:18.959
I absolutely did not do
that thing you accuse me of.

18:19.083 --> 18:21.333
Hey, Susan. Hey, Mrs. Huber.

18:21.417 --> 18:25.375
- Nice to see you, Mike.
- Hey.

18:25.458 --> 18:29.917
You like Alfred Hitchcock? They're
doing a retrospective at the Rialto.

18:35.166 --> 18:37.500
I'm not really a fan.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.542
Come on,
how can you not like Hitchcock?

18:40.667 --> 18:43.458
I just don't.

18:51.166 --> 18:55.959
Well, nice to see you.
You too, Mrs. Huber.

18:59.792 --> 19:03.709
You're so silly. Pretending not
to like him on my account.

19:03.792 --> 19:05.083
I mean, really.

19:05.166 --> 19:09.375
- Will you just drop it?
- You shouldn't be rude to me.

19:09.458 --> 19:12.792
Your secret is not
an easy burden to bear.

19:12.917 --> 19:16.208
That insurance company
is putting Edie through hell.

19:16.291 --> 19:18.542
- But still I've said nothing.
- Well...

19:18.625 --> 19:23.625
The longer it takes for her payment,
the longer she'll be staying with me.

19:23.750 --> 19:28.166
Eating me out of house and home.
Using up my hot water.

19:30.208 --> 19:33.834
What exactly is it
you want from me, Mrs. Huber?

19:40.667 --> 19:43.625
Are these together?

19:51.959 --> 19:53.083
Ring it up.

20:03.959 --> 20:08.583
If the school and the pediatrician
think the twins could be medicated,

20:08.667 --> 20:10.667
then what's the problem?

20:10.750 --> 20:12.917
I used to run a company with 85 people,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.750
and now I can't wrangle three small boys
without doping them?

20:16.834 --> 20:20.166
- Talk about feeling like a failure.
- You are a great mother.

20:20.250 --> 20:25.333
But, let's face it,
your kids are a challenge.

20:25.417 --> 20:29.917
Thank you. That's the nicest way
you could've said that.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.917
When they're not making me
want to tear my hair out,

20:33.041 --> 20:35.291
they're actually really sweet.

20:35.417 --> 20:39.792
I'm afraid if I change the bad stuff,
I'm going to change the good stuff.

20:39.875 --> 20:43.166
- It's a tough call.
- Like this mug.

20:43.250 --> 20:49.291
I love this mug. If I medicate them,
will they still make me a mug like this?

20:49.375 --> 20:55.333
- You know, it's leaking.
- Yeah, I know.

20:57.917 --> 21:01.166
We talked to Paul. We told him
we need to show him something.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.166
He's on his way over.

21:06.583 --> 21:09.667
So, Paul, we notice that
you're selling the house.

21:09.750 --> 21:13.500
Yes, too many painful memories.
I'm sure you understand.

21:18.750 --> 21:21.875
Before you move, there's
something you should know.

21:21.959 --> 21:27.000
It seems there may be more to Mary
Alice's death than you are aware of.

21:28.875 --> 21:32.458
Remember when you asked us
to pack her things?

21:32.542 --> 21:36.333
- When we did we found a note.
- And we think you should have it.

21:38.208 --> 21:43.417
You can see from the postmark, Mary
Alice probably got it the day she died.

22:07.166 --> 22:12.208
- Paul, are you going to be OK?
- No.

22:37.834 --> 22:42.125
- Have you always cleaned with socks?
- Yes.

22:44.458 --> 22:48.000
- What is that, a Japanese thing?
- I am Chinese.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.667
- I don't like lying.
- Yeah?

22:59.750 --> 23:03.000
I don't like your ironing, so there.

23:18.667 --> 23:22.208
- What are you doing here?
- Carlos found this under the bed.

23:23.083 --> 23:24.583
Oh, crap.

23:24.709 --> 23:27.458
It's OK. It was close call,
but I managed to cover.

23:27.542 --> 23:29.417
I got you these, so from now on,

23:29.542 --> 23:33.500
we can't let Carlos see you wearing
anything resembling a gym sock.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.417
You want me to mow your lawn
in sandals. I could lose a toe.

23:37.500 --> 23:43.250
Imagine what you'd lose if he finds out
you're trimming more than the hedge.

23:43.917 --> 23:46.750
Why are your friends staring at me?

23:47.417 --> 23:49.208
- Did you tell them about us?
- No.

23:50.875 --> 23:53.959
They're staring 'cause
they think you're hot.

24:02.083 --> 24:05.083
It's 9.30.
What is your brother thinking?

24:05.166 --> 24:08.875
Want my advice? Call Dad.
Tell him to go kick Andrew's ass.

24:08.959 --> 24:12.166
I am capable of handling this
without your father.

24:12.250 --> 24:16.041
- I'm sorry.
- Where's your cell phone?

24:17.917 --> 24:21.709
- Call Andrew. Find out where he is.
- He'll know you're behind this.

24:21.792 --> 24:24.417
He won't. Just act normal.

24:26.750 --> 24:30.208
Hey, it's me. What's going on?

24:33.291 --> 24:34.458
He knows.

24:36.500 --> 24:37.959
This is your mother.

24:38.041 --> 24:42.125
I am rapidly reaching the end
of my patience with you.

24:42.208 --> 24:45.959
Where are you?
Are you at a bar?

24:46.125 --> 24:48.750
Andrew? Andrew?

24:51.959 --> 24:54.125
- Mom?
- He hung up on me.

24:55.709 --> 24:58.333
What are you gonna do?

25:39.291 --> 25:41.458
Shake it, baby!

25:41.542 --> 25:43.041
Over here!

25:45.834 --> 25:49.959
Heath. Ian. Andrew.

25:52.041 --> 25:54.875
Mom, how did you even
know I was here?

25:58.166 --> 26:00.667
- You went in my room?
- You think that's bad?

26:00.750 --> 26:04.375
Tomorrow morning, I'm cleaning it.
By the way, Heath.

26:04.458 --> 26:08.208
That was a lovely solo
last week at church.

26:09.375 --> 26:11.625
Thank you. We're out of here.

26:13.542 --> 26:16.250
I hope it wasn't something I said.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.125
Well, Andrew, shall we?

26:22.500 --> 26:25.250
You just humiliated me
in front of my friends.

26:25.333 --> 26:28.500
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Fine.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.291
- What are you doing?
- Staying for the show.

26:35.417 --> 26:38.166
I'm dying to see
what all the fuss is about.

26:38.250 --> 26:41.375
Excuse me, I'll have
a glass of your house chardonnay.

26:41.458 --> 26:43.583
Of course, ma'am.

26:49.083 --> 26:52.417
I'm curious. As you fantasize
about this woman,

26:52.500 --> 26:55.959
do you ever stop and think
how she came to be on this runway?

26:56.083 --> 26:58.583
That's someone's little girl.

26:58.709 --> 27:01.458
That someone probably
had a lot of dreams for her.

27:01.542 --> 27:04.542
Dreams that did not include
a thong and a pole.

27:04.625 --> 27:08.375
It's not going to work, OK?
I'm not budging.

27:08.458 --> 27:10.959
God knows what
she's had to deal with in life.

27:11.083 --> 27:15.667
Abject poverty, drugs, domestic
violence, maybe even molestation.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.375
Mom!

27:17.458 --> 27:20.834
Now she treats herself the way
men treat her. Like an object.

27:20.959 --> 27:23.333
A piece of meat.

27:23.458 --> 27:26.083
That does it. Kid, get her out of here.

27:26.166 --> 27:29.291
She's killing it for the rest of us.

27:36.458 --> 27:39.166
<i>We're not here, leave a message.</i>

27:39.250 --> 27:43.875
<i>It's Mrs. Huber, Susan, are you there?</i>
<i>I can see your lights are on.</i>

27:43.959 --> 27:49.542
<i>I hope you're not screening. That's so</i>
<i>tacky. Listen. I need to talk to you.</i>

27:49.625 --> 27:54.000
<i>My water heater just burst</i>
<i>and it's gonna cost $600 for a new one.</i>

27:54.125 --> 27:56.083
<i>And I can't afford that.</i>

27:56.166 --> 28:00.166
<i>I'm just beside myself.</i>
<i>Call me as soon as you get in.</i>

28:06.166 --> 28:09.125
Julie, honey, wake up.
We need to talk.

28:09.208 --> 28:15.542
- Can't this wait until morning?
- I think I'm being blackmailed.

28:15.667 --> 28:20.083
And when I realized
I couldn't put out the fire, I ran.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.458
I must've dropped
the measuring cup.

28:22.583 --> 28:25.208
Why do I even let you out of the house?

28:25.333 --> 28:27.083
She can't get away with this.

28:27.166 --> 28:29.709
The only thing to do
is go to the police.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.250
You can't do that.

28:31.333 --> 28:34.333
I don't think
they'll throw me in jail.

28:34.417 --> 28:36.083
It was an accident.

28:36.166 --> 28:39.291
Dad won't care if it was an accident.

28:39.375 --> 28:43.250
He'll just use this
as an excuse to reopen custody.

28:44.083 --> 28:48.500
- Mom, I don't want to live with Dad.
- I know.

29:06.250 --> 29:08.917
- I need to talk to you.
- Cool. Sure.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.250
- You were working Tuesday, right?
- Yeah.

29:15.542 --> 29:18.291
You remember the cable guy showing up?

29:18.417 --> 29:21.542
And you usually work till
what time, five?

29:21.625 --> 29:23.458
Yeah.

29:24.375 --> 29:27.959
Damn it. That means
he was in the house for four hours.

29:28.917 --> 29:34.250
Wait. Now that I think about it,
I might not have seen him.

29:35.333 --> 29:37.875
Either you saw him or you didn't.
Which is it?

29:37.959 --> 29:40.083
I didn't.

29:42.542 --> 29:43.792
John...

29:45.375 --> 29:48.834
...did my wife ask you to lie for her?

29:48.917 --> 29:54.792
Mr. Solis, I really don't want
to get in the middle of anything.

29:58.583 --> 30:02.208
Thank you.
That's all I needed to know.

30:10.125 --> 30:14.000
- Let's run through it one more time.
- Mom, it's not brain surgery.

30:14.125 --> 30:17.250
You stand guard, I crawl
through Mrs. Huber's doggy door.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.917
Once inside, I find
the measuring cup. Simple.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.375
God, I hate that I'm turning you
into a little thief.

30:23.959 --> 30:27.083
It's our cup.
We're just taking back what's ours.

30:27.208 --> 30:33.208
That's right. Ethically,
we have nothing to be ashamed about.

30:34.083 --> 30:37.667
Wear these. I don't want you
to leave finger prints.

30:43.125 --> 30:47.250
There she goes. OK. Move.

30:48.417 --> 30:53.000
So glad to be playing Frisbee again.
Here you go. Coming at ya.

30:53.083 --> 30:56.458
All right. Back up a little more.
There you go.

30:57.667 --> 30:59.333
All right. Here we go.

31:03.542 --> 31:06.500
You better go get that.

31:15.542 --> 31:18.667
- Mike.
- Hey, Susan. I thought that was you.

31:18.750 --> 31:22.709
Yeah. Julie and I are out
tossing a Frisbee around,

31:22.834 --> 31:25.083
and it flew off
into Mrs. Huber's back yard.

31:25.208 --> 31:28.375
- You need some help?
- No. Julie's got it.

31:29.542 --> 31:34.458
OK. I'm glad I ran into you. I wanted to
make sure things were OK between us.

31:34.542 --> 31:38.542
- The other day, you seemed distant.
- Distant? What do you mean?

31:38.625 --> 31:42.458
I mean, you're not mad at me
for some reason, are you?

31:42.542 --> 31:45.667
No. No, not at all.

31:45.750 --> 31:48.542
Good. 'Cause I'm gonna take one more
shot.

31:48.667 --> 31:52.250
I got tickets for a Billy Wilder
retrospective, Wednesday night.

31:52.333 --> 31:59.000
- I'd love to take you with me.
- You are so sweet. I'd love to go.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.458
All right.

32:06.417 --> 32:08.792
Edie, I thought you'd be at work.

32:08.875 --> 32:14.709
I'm not feeling well. I got a sunburn
the other day washing my car.

32:14.792 --> 32:19.625
Well, don't just run off.
Come and hang out with us.

32:19.750 --> 32:22.166
- Boy, you are one sick ticket.
- What?

32:22.583 --> 32:26.667
It's not bad enough I have to watch you
throw yourself at him every day.

32:26.750 --> 32:29.458
Now you want to make sure
I see it up close?

32:29.583 --> 32:32.041
- No, it's not like that.
- I've got to take off.

32:32.125 --> 32:34.875
I'll call about Wednesday night, OK?

32:36.166 --> 32:37.917
Edie, wait.

32:41.083 --> 32:44.208
Mike and I were gonna go see
the movies on Wednesday

32:44.291 --> 32:46.959
and I thought it would be fun
if you joined us.

32:47.041 --> 32:50.750
- You want me to come with you?
- Yeah.

32:50.834 --> 32:54.917
- Yeah, that's OK, isn't it, Mike?
- Well, it's a limited engagement.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.750
And it's sold out.
I've only got two tickets.

32:58.834 --> 33:03.250
Edie, wait.
You should take my ticket.

33:06.250 --> 33:09.875
Really? Is that OK with you, Mike?

33:13.291 --> 33:14.625
Yeah, sure.

33:16.375 --> 33:20.959
So, what time
do you want to pick me up?

33:23.583 --> 33:24.875
Well...

33:41.917 --> 33:43.667
Hang on.

33:51.250 --> 33:54.834
You think you can have sex
with anyone you want, huh?

33:56.166 --> 33:59.583
<i>Carlos couldn't help</i>
<i>but feel proud of himself.</i>

33:59.667 --> 34:03.583
<i>After all,</i>
<i>he'd just defended his honor.</i>

34:03.709 --> 34:05.083
<i>Or had he?</i>

34:20.208 --> 34:24.834
- Are you gay?
- Yes. Is that why you're doing this?

34:26.875 --> 34:29.041
Yeah.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.709
"...will you buy some chocolates?"

34:38.834 --> 34:40.250
Ladies.

34:42.208 --> 34:43.875
Hey, Paul, what's up?

34:43.959 --> 34:46.667
I wanted to apologize
for my outburst yesterday.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.792
Don't worry about it.
We unloaded a lot on you.

34:49.917 --> 34:53.500
I suppose you're wondering
why I reacted so violently.

34:53.583 --> 34:55.709
It did cross our minds.

34:55.834 --> 34:59.709
Well, the truth is,
Mary Alice was not a well person.

34:59.834 --> 35:01.917
She was very troubled.

35:03.166 --> 35:06.333
- Troubled?
- At first it was harmless.

35:06.417 --> 35:08.917
She'd leave herself notes,
reminders like,

35:09.000 --> 35:12.667
"Pick up the milk" or
"Zach has a dentist appointment."

35:12.750 --> 35:16.625
But the notes became ugly.
Hateful messages started showing up.

35:16.750 --> 35:21.083
Mary Alice was writing them to me,
to Zach, to herself.

35:21.208 --> 35:24.542
- Really?
- That's why I lost it.

35:24.625 --> 35:27.959
I was reminded of what
Zach and I had been through.

35:29.417 --> 35:32.291
- Paul, I'm so sorry.
- We had no idea.

35:32.417 --> 35:33.458
No.

35:34.750 --> 35:38.125
Anyway, I'd appreciate it
if you kept this to yourselves.

35:39.083 --> 35:40.208
Yeah.

35:40.291 --> 35:44.375
- For Zach's sake.
- Of course. Of course.

35:45.083 --> 35:46.750
Bye.

35:52.125 --> 35:55.291
- I think he's lying.
- So do I.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.834
You didn't get me!

36:30.500 --> 36:32.792
Boys, could you get in here, please?

36:33.750 --> 36:35.834
- He broke my plane.
- Did not.

36:35.917 --> 36:38.917
We'll discuss that later.
I need you to take medicine.

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
- Are we sick?
- Not exactly. This is special medicine.

36:44.083 --> 36:47.291
It's like a vitamin
and you'll take it every day, OK?

36:50.792 --> 36:52.792
Stay right there.

37:03.875 --> 37:05.125
Now open up.

37:06.542 --> 37:09.000
- Here, you...
- No.

37:09.083 --> 37:13.375
- Guys, this is a... Guys, here...
- Nope.

37:17.542 --> 37:21.458
<i>In that moment,</i>
<i>Lynette made a decision.</i>

37:21.542 --> 37:24.208
<i>When it came to</i>
<i>dealing with her children,</i>

37:24.333 --> 37:28.375
<i>medication was no longer an option.</i>

37:29.667 --> 37:32.792
<i>Of course, given her continuing level</i>
<i>of frustration,</i>

37:32.917 --> 37:37.625
<i>Lynette also felt a little</i>
<i>self-medication couldn't hurt.</i>

37:46.917 --> 37:48.667
So what's your strategy?

37:48.750 --> 37:52.458
Are you just never gonna
speak to me again?

37:52.542 --> 37:55.875
Something like that.

37:57.417 --> 37:59.333
I suppose I do owe you an apology.

37:59.417 --> 38:03.166
Careful. I wouldn't want you
to strain yourself.

38:03.250 --> 38:05.667
I shouldn't have lied
about your father.

38:05.750 --> 38:09.417
You two are old enough to handle
the truth and I'm sorry.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.458
Keep going.

38:11.542 --> 38:14.125
I'm mad at you
for about 7,000 other things.

38:14.208 --> 38:18.458
If you think I'll apologize for taking
you out of a strip club, you're wrong.

38:18.542 --> 38:22.500
I consider it one of my finest moments.

38:28.959 --> 38:32.625
I know you blame me
for what's happening with your father,

38:32.750 --> 38:36.291
but it's not entirely my fault
and I need you to understand that.

38:39.917 --> 38:42.208
I do.

38:42.291 --> 38:46.250
I just don't want him to leave.

38:52.583 --> 38:55.250
Neither do I.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.625
- Mom.
- Yeah?

38:59.417 --> 39:01.333
When can I have my door back?

39:05.000 --> 39:07.375
Three months.

39:07.458 --> 39:09.917
<i>Royal Oaks was the scene</i>
<i>of a hate crime today.</i>

39:10.000 --> 39:14.375
<i>Jonathan Lithgow, local gay activist</i>
<i>and part-time female impersonator,</i>

39:14.500 --> 39:16.750
<i>was brutally attacked in his home.</i>

39:16.834 --> 39:20.417
<i>Lithgow speculated the attack</i>
<i>was in response to his efforts</i>

39:20.500 --> 39:24.458
<i>to secure same-sex partner insurance</i>
<i>coverage from his employer,</i>

39:24.542 --> 39:25.875
<i>Cliffside Cable.</i>

39:26.000 --> 39:29.166
<i>Police are circulating</i>
<i>this sketch of the assailant.</i>

39:29.291 --> 39:32.000
<i>The circumstances</i>
<i>speak for themselves.</i>

39:32.083 --> 39:35.166
<i>I've taken a strong stance</i>
<i>with my company.</i>

39:35.250 --> 39:37.709
Is there something
you want to ask me?

39:39.208 --> 39:41.333
No.

39:53.667 --> 39:55.166
You took it, didn't you?

39:58.166 --> 40:02.125
- Good evening, Mrs. Huber.
- It's my fault for not hiding the cup.

40:02.208 --> 40:06.333
If you're capable of arson, you're
capable of breaking and entering.

40:07.375 --> 40:09.542
I don't know what
you're talking about.

40:09.667 --> 40:11.583
I suppose you destroyed it.

40:12.625 --> 40:18.750
Again, I don't know what
you're talking about, but...yeah, I did.

40:20.083 --> 40:24.750
I was going to keep your secret.
It's a shame you couldn't trust me.

40:24.834 --> 40:29.166
You're a piece of work.
Do you know that?

40:29.250 --> 40:31.792
Susan, let's not be unpleasant.

40:31.917 --> 40:36.000
We can go back to the same friendly
relationship we've always had.

40:38.375 --> 40:40.667
I will keep my lawn looking nice,

40:40.750 --> 40:43.291
and make sure my music
isn't played too loud.

40:43.375 --> 40:46.667
And if I get some of your mail,
heck, I'll run it right over,

40:46.750 --> 40:49.333
'cause that's what good neighbors do.

40:49.417 --> 40:53.041
But from now on,
when I run into you on the street,

40:53.125 --> 40:57.709
and I say, "Good morning, Mrs. Huber"
or "How are you, Mrs. Huber?"

40:57.792 --> 41:00.875
just know that inside

41:00.959 --> 41:05.875
I am quietly
but decidedly hating your guts.

41:08.458 --> 41:13.041
Careful, dear, let's not say things
we'll live to regret.

41:16.041 --> 41:18.458
Good evening, Mrs. Huber.

41:28.625 --> 41:31.125
He actually said
Mary Alice was crazy?

41:31.291 --> 41:33.792
Not in so many words,
but everything Paul said

41:33.917 --> 41:36.125
made it seem
like she was schizophrenic.

41:36.208 --> 41:38.458
I think he's hiding something.
I know it.

41:38.542 --> 41:42.291
But wait, what about the tape?
She did say her name was Angela.

41:43.291 --> 41:46.834
- Mary Alice was not crazy.
- My father was a prosecutor.

41:46.917 --> 41:50.542
He always said that the simplest
explanation was usually right.

41:50.667 --> 41:54.417
Remember what the note said:
"I know what you did. It makes me sick.

41:54.500 --> 41:55.875
And I'm going to tell."

41:55.959 --> 41:58.917
That's not something
someone writes to themselves.

41:59.041 --> 42:01.750
That's a message sent by an enemy.

42:09.917 --> 42:13.792
So exactly what is it
you hired me to do?

42:13.875 --> 42:16.583
It's very simple really.

42:16.667 --> 42:22.041
Someone sent that note to my wife
and I need to know who.

42:23.333 --> 42:27.792
<i>What type of person</i>
<i>would send such a note?</i>

42:27.875 --> 42:31.458
<i>Was it an enemy? Of course.</i>

42:31.542 --> 42:35.375
<i>But what kind? An acquaintance?</i>

42:35.458 --> 42:37.667
<i>A stranger?</i>

42:37.750 --> 42:43.625
<i>Or how about a neighbor</i>
<i>that lives a few feet away?</i>
