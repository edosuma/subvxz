WEBVTT

00:30.468 --> 00:32.868
'There's now two minutes to the off.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.667
'And away they go.'

01:01.468 --> 01:02.468
Yes!

01:13.828 --> 01:15.468
Thanks for coming.

01:16.468 --> 01:18.467
- Hey, Alun.
- Really appreciate it.

01:18.468 --> 01:19.768
Excuse me.

01:22.468 --> 01:25.467
Alun, go home. To your family.

01:25.468 --> 01:27.868
I'll see you bright and early tomorrow.

01:29.061 --> 01:30.949
Send me that agenda.

01:34.060 --> 01:35.468
Congratulations.

01:50.468 --> 01:52.468
Where's the safe?

02:43.468 --> 02:45.140
We've gotta warn him.

02:49.468 --> 02:50.468
Please!

02:50.469 --> 02:52.368
Please, please!

02:58.468 --> 02:59.468
Louise?

03:00.668 --> 03:01.828
Louise?

03:12.148 --> 03:13.668
Just let her go.

03:19.019 --> 03:21.787
Dad? Dad?

03:21.988 --> 03:23.668
Call an ambulance!

04:15.508 --> 04:17.267
{\an1}Morning Ma'am.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.390
{\an1}Middle-aged man,
Alun Wilmott.

04:19.468 --> 04:22.787
{\an1}Was murdered last night as he
confronted a couple of intruders.

04:22.788 --> 04:25.467
{\an1}One of them was armed. Apparently,
the gun went off in a struggle.

04:25.468 --> 04:28.467
{\an1}This Alun Wilmott,
the betting magnate?

04:28.468 --> 04:31.467
{\an1}Yeah, his wife and daughter were in
the house, Louise and Jess Wilmott.

04:31.468 --> 04:33.467
{\an3}So where are they now?

04:33.468 --> 04:36.174
{\an3}Um, over at the neighbours.
I've got Jac to keep an eye on 'em.

04:36.175 --> 04:37.507
Right.

04:37.508 --> 04:41.468
{\an3}24/7 security?
Lot of good that did.

04:42.468 --> 04:44.367
{\an1}- Ma'am.
- Thanks.

04:44.468 --> 04:46.963
{\an1}Now, I'm gonna need a word
with the hired muscle.

04:46.964 --> 04:51.468
And put out a press statement, so
get in touch with the Press Office.

04:52.264 --> 04:54.464
Papers'll be all over this.

05:02.468 --> 05:03.468
Malcolm?

05:03.469 --> 05:05.467
Watch where you're putting
your feet, please.

05:05.468 --> 05:07.947
Oh, I'll come in again through
the back door, shall I?

05:07.948 --> 05:09.707
Well, the scene's already
been compromised.

05:09.708 --> 05:12.168
There's boot treads
all over the hallway.

05:17.468 --> 05:19.320
So, what can you tell us?

05:20.168 --> 05:21.827
Single bullet wound to the chest.

05:21.828 --> 05:24.467
He was dead by the time
the paramedics arrived.

05:24.468 --> 05:28.467
Now, there's some tattooing
on his shirt around the bullet hole.

05:28.468 --> 05:30.468
Hot discharge residue.

05:31.468 --> 05:33.940
No sign of an exit wound.

05:35.468 --> 05:38.468
If we find the bullet intact,
might well help us trace the weapon.

05:38.787 --> 05:39.787
Mm...

05:44.060 --> 05:45.862
Fancy place.

05:45.863 --> 05:48.467
Well, it's just lost a chunk of
its real estate value.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.467
We'll start a sweep
of the downstairs

05:52.468 --> 05:54.467
as soon as we get him
bagged and tagged.

05:54.468 --> 05:57.467
Well, let us know if you find anything.

05:57.468 --> 06:00.468
- Watch where you put your feet.
- I heard you the first time, Malcolm.

06:10.468 --> 06:11.468
Ma'am.

06:13.148 --> 06:14.968
Safe's been cleaned out.

06:16.139 --> 06:18.239
It's a combination lock...

06:18.580 --> 06:20.667
so, someone must have
opened it for 'em.

06:20.668 --> 06:23.467
I've got the inventory of
the contents that were taken.

06:23.468 --> 06:27.467
There's passports, jewellery...
couple of watches.

06:27.468 --> 06:29.120
Expensive watches.

06:29.468 --> 06:31.467
20 grand in cash!

06:31.468 --> 06:32.868
20 grand.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.467
That's just pin money
to a fella like Wilmott.

06:36.468 --> 06:39.283
Wife and daughter were
home alone when they broke in.

06:39.284 --> 06:42.467
- So where was he?
-He was in town at a charity race night.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.307
That dog track he owned in the city.

06:44.308 --> 06:46.000
Moorden Fields?

06:47.368 --> 06:49.467
So it would've been
common knowledge, then,

06:49.468 --> 06:50.987
that he was at the track.

06:50.988 --> 06:53.467
Maybe someone thought
they'd be an easy target.

06:53.468 --> 06:55.720
So why bring a firearm?

06:56.468 --> 06:57.468
Hmm?

06:57.469 --> 06:59.768
That's just asking for trouble.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.158
They came in over the
garden fence at the back.

07:09.159 --> 07:11.987
Smashed the patio doors.

07:11.988 --> 07:14.467
I'd say this was a botched burglary.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.467
Husband came home,
disturbed them in the act.

07:16.468 --> 07:19.468
No, they knew there was a safe
in the house.

07:20.413 --> 07:22.413
But 20 grand in cash?

07:24.303 --> 07:28.303
Either it was their lucky day,
or someone gave 'em the heads-up.

07:35.468 --> 07:37.229
- What do you reckon?
- By the front gate.

07:37.230 --> 07:38.468
Ma'am!

07:40.849 --> 07:42.467
This is Ciaran Duggan.

07:42.468 --> 07:44.467
He's the head of
the neighbourhood security.

07:44.468 --> 07:47.468
Right, DCI Stanhope.
I'm running this investigation.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.147
Right, any way we can help?

07:50.148 --> 07:53.147
Well, you can start by telling us
who was on patrol last night.

07:53.148 --> 07:55.233
That would've been Ryan. Ryan?

07:55.253 --> 07:56.787
Get over here.

07:57.964 --> 08:02.467
Right, the, er... your gaffer says
you were working the evening shift.

08:02.468 --> 08:04.057
Aye, that's right.

08:04.058 --> 08:07.307
I did a drive past the Wilmotts' at...

08:07.308 --> 08:09.467
20:55.

08:09.468 --> 08:11.467
You see anythin
 out of the ordinary?

08:11.468 --> 08:13.467
It was pretty quiet, like.

08:13.468 --> 08:15.348
Usually is around here.

08:16.468 --> 08:18.467
So when did you hear about the break-in?

08:18.468 --> 08:20.283
I got a call from the control room,

08:20.284 --> 08:22.190
someone in the house
had pressed a panic button.

08:22.191 --> 08:25.147
- Yeah, what time was that?
- Just after 9pm.

08:25.148 --> 08:27.467
The police were informed at the time.

08:27.468 --> 08:30.467
- We'll look into it.
- Well, I drove here as soon as I heard.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.567
You weren't on duty yourself,
then?

08:32.568 --> 08:35.568
No, I was, er,
working back at the office.

08:35.936 --> 08:37.120
Right.

08:38.249 --> 08:41.249
Now, did either of you enter
the property?

08:42.342 --> 08:43.861
Well, er, a man had just been shot.

08:43.886 --> 08:46.100
Aye, trampled all over the crime scene.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.965
Given the circumstances,
I think we acted appropriately.

08:49.167 --> 08:52.020
Now, can you take your boots off,
give 'em to DC Lockhart.

08:52.045 --> 08:53.780
Need to rule them out as evidence.

08:53.805 --> 08:55.816
Well, come on,
we haven't got all day!

08:55.861 --> 08:58.261
And the same goes for you.
Get 'em off!

08:59.468 --> 09:02.467
So, how long have you had
this security company?

09:02.468 --> 09:05.467
We won the tender...
6 months ago.

09:05.468 --> 09:06.827
Four-man team.

09:06.828 --> 09:08.827
Roving patrols and alarmed response.

09:08.828 --> 09:10.667
Ah, all right, if you can afford it.

09:10.668 --> 09:12.467
We're a visible deterrent.

09:12.468 --> 09:15.828
Oh, that's obvious,
all that bling you're wearing.

09:16.828 --> 09:20.467
Right. Logs, CCTV,
body cams, dashcams, the lot.

09:20.468 --> 09:23.468
See if we can find anything
Ryan might have missed.

09:45.468 --> 09:48.107
I found some more tyre tracks
further down the lane.

09:48.108 --> 09:49.139
Hmm?

09:49.140 --> 09:51.959
They took off on a getaway bike,
out of sight of any cameras.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.467
This must've taken some planning.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.467
Chances are
they'd been watching the place.

09:56.468 --> 10:00.467
Well, then they'd have known about
the security patrols, wouldn't they?

10:00.468 --> 10:04.468
Get the CSI team down here.
Cordon off the whole lane.

10:06.468 --> 10:10.279
Now, we know your husband had been
at the race track last night.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.467
Charity event.

10:11.468 --> 10:13.849
He'd messaged me to say
he was on his way home.

10:13.850 --> 10:15.178
Right.

10:15.179 --> 10:18.467
I heard talking downstairs.
I thought it must be Alun.

10:18.468 --> 10:20.180
Then I heard Jess scream.

10:21.023 --> 10:23.686
So you were the first one to see
these intruders?

10:23.811 --> 10:28.467
No, I didn't see their faces.
They were both wearing masks.

10:28.468 --> 10:30.467
So, what about their voices?

10:30.468 --> 10:33.667
They sounded local.
I think one of them was older.

10:33.668 --> 10:36.467
Oh, what makes you say that, love?

10:36.468 --> 10:38.467
Just the way he talked.

10:38.468 --> 10:41.248
Clearly he was the one calling the shots.

10:42.468 --> 10:43.468
Right.

10:45.468 --> 10:48.468
Did you tell him
there was a safe in the house?

10:48.820 --> 10:52.467
We didn't tell him anything...
until we saw the gun.

10:52.468 --> 10:55.468
What about this other fella, hmm?

10:56.264 --> 10:58.304
Anything stand out?

10:59.468 --> 11:04.468
He was wearing trainers...
like, flash stripes.

11:05.304 --> 11:07.604
It just stayed in my head,
you know?

11:07.900 --> 11:11.020
Look, I know this is hard, love

11:12.092 --> 11:15.092
but if there's anything at all
you can tell us...

11:15.795 --> 11:18.095
that might help us to catch 'em.

11:19.131 --> 11:21.540
There was a struggle out in the hall.

11:21.828 --> 11:23.668
The gun went off.

11:24.311 --> 11:28.151
Next thing I knew,
he was lying there, bleeding.

11:28.198 --> 11:31.358
Now, did either of you notice
anything suspicious,

11:31.383 --> 11:33.820
weeks leading up to this?

11:34.061 --> 11:37.061
We have been getting
nuisance phone calls.

11:37.086 --> 11:40.086
Landline. We hardly use it.

11:40.296 --> 11:42.976
But the caller always
hung up when I answered.

11:43.148 --> 11:44.308
Mm.

11:45.468 --> 11:47.367
Right, so, er...

11:47.368 --> 11:49.467
Now, is there somewhere else
you can stay,

11:49.468 --> 11:52.147
other than here with your neighbours?

11:52.148 --> 11:54.467
My mum's. She's over in South Shields.

11:54.468 --> 11:58.467
We'll need to get some swabs
and prints. No rush.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.968
Yeah, we'll get someone
to drive you over.

12:02.468 --> 12:05.467
I'll need to fetch a few things...
from the house.

12:05.468 --> 12:08.147
Right. Well, that can be arranged...

12:08.148 --> 12:10.468
after forensics have finished.

12:11.468 --> 12:13.120
Maybe tomorrow.

12:26.468 --> 12:29.467
Ma'am, these are the owners of
the house, Gayle and lain Beecher.

12:29.468 --> 12:30.948
Right.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.624
Right,
you wanted to see me?

12:34.649 --> 12:37.120
You should know there's been
a recent spike in crime.

12:37.145 --> 12:38.123
Huh?

12:38.148 --> 12:40.467
Thefts from cars.
Kids hanging around on the streets.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.900
It's the reason we hired
the security patrols.

12:43.668 --> 12:46.779
Now, who pays for these patrols?

12:46.780 --> 12:48.827
The residents, we all chip in.

12:48.828 --> 12:52.467
I'm away a fair bit with work.
I suppose it puts my mind at rest.

12:52.468 --> 12:55.467
So, you would've known Alun Wilmott
well enough?

12:55.468 --> 12:57.810
The Wilmotts kept themselves
to themselves.

12:57.811 --> 13:00.795
I'd stop for a chat with Louise
every time I ran into her,

13:00.796 --> 13:03.200
but I wouldn't say we were friends.

13:03.987 --> 13:06.447
I know Jess was close to her dad.

13:06.468 --> 13:09.467
She'd rather spend all his money
than go out and earn it.

13:09.468 --> 13:11.360
Spoiled rotten, that one.

13:35.468 --> 13:37.468
Can I come in?

13:40.468 --> 13:41.468
Wow!

13:42.468 --> 13:44.468
Constellations.

13:44.686 --> 13:45.686
Hmm.

13:47.468 --> 13:51.467
Wow! I bet you can name a few.

13:51.468 --> 13:54.307
My favourite is Orion.

13:54.308 --> 13:56.767
Ah! The Hunter. Hmm?

13:58.147 --> 14:01.467
Its biggest stars are super giants.

14:01.468 --> 14:02.468
Right.

14:03.741 --> 14:06.741
I might go into space one day.

14:07.468 --> 14:09.060
Yeah?

14:09.842 --> 14:10.842
Wow!

14:15.468 --> 14:18.467
Now, were you looking at
stars last night?

14:18.468 --> 14:20.467
Should've been in bed.

14:20.468 --> 14:23.467
Well, I won't say if you don't.

14:23.468 --> 14:26.467
You plainclothes, then?

14:26.468 --> 14:29.468
Well... Well,
that's one way of putting it.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.827
Coppers can't be trusted.

14:33.468 --> 14:34.987
What makes you say that?

14:34.988 --> 14:37.467
They killed Jess' dad.

14:37.468 --> 14:40.468
No, the police didn't kill
Jess's dad, love.

14:41.468 --> 14:44.467
And it's my job to find out who did,

14:44.468 --> 14:47.308
so if there's something
you want to tell us...

14:50.468 --> 14:52.467
They drove away on a motorbike.

14:52.468 --> 14:54.468
Did you see their faces?

14:55.508 --> 14:58.467
They were both wearing crash helmets.

14:59.508 --> 15:01.468
It's the law.

15:02.340 --> 15:06.038
Well, if there's nothing else you
want to tell us...

15:06.063 --> 15:08.523
I'd better get back to the station.

15:08.779 --> 15:11.779
I wrote down the number plates.

15:19.823 --> 15:22.623
Thought it might be important.

15:25.194 --> 15:27.034
Good lad.

15:32.468 --> 15:34.468
It's this one here.

15:37.053 --> 15:39.440
Adam's got it into his head
that it was the police

15:39.468 --> 15:41.367
who killed Jess's dad.

15:41.368 --> 15:43.467
Adam has a vivid imagination.

15:43.468 --> 15:47.467
But there must've been something
prompted that train of thought?

15:47.468 --> 15:50.140
He confuses the police
with those security patrols.

15:50.165 --> 15:52.265
All he sees is a uniform.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.889
I get the impression
you're not that enamoured.

15:58.351 --> 16:00.467
Glorified vigilantes.

16:00.468 --> 16:02.980
That one even threatened Adam.

16:03.268 --> 16:04.468
When was that?

16:04.469 --> 16:08.209
A few weeks ago.
Accused him of loitering.

16:08.210 --> 16:10.468
He was just out on his bike!

16:19.468 --> 16:20.827
Alun Wilmott.

16:20.828 --> 16:24.467
Owner of OnTrack Bets,
a company he founded in Newcastle.

16:24.468 --> 16:29.467
He was fatally wounded last night at
his home in Loxmere.

16:29.468 --> 16:31.467
Aggravated burglary.

16:31.468 --> 16:34.467
His wife and daughter
were held up at gunpoint

16:34.468 --> 16:37.467
by two unidentified male intruders.

16:37.468 --> 16:41.467
Our victim had been at
a charity event at the track,

16:41.468 --> 16:43.667
and he returned home early
and disturbed them.

16:43.668 --> 16:47.467
The area is patrolled by Duggan Security,

16:47.468 --> 16:49.467
and they were the first on the scene.

16:49.468 --> 16:52.467
Some watches and jewellery were
stolen from the safe,

16:52.468 --> 16:54.467
insured for over £100,000.

16:54.468 --> 16:56.507
And not to mention 20 grand in cash!

16:56.508 --> 17:00.467
Now, the watches are personalised
with the initials AAW.

17:00.468 --> 17:02.467
Alun Anthony Wilmott.

17:02.468 --> 17:06.467
So, what do we have to go on, hmm?

17:06.468 --> 17:08.467
- CCTV?
- Camera's show...

17:08.468 --> 17:11.467
his car arrived back at 9:06.

17:11.468 --> 17:13.700
No sign of anything out of the ordinary.

17:14.468 --> 17:18.467
Now, there's a track,
runs down the side of the house.

17:18.468 --> 17:22.467
And the intruders made access by
climbing over the back fence.

17:22.468 --> 17:26.467
Now, the lad who lives next door
said he saw these intruders

17:26.468 --> 17:27.987
leaving on a motorbike.

17:27.988 --> 17:30.467
And lucky for us,
he took down the registration.

17:30.468 --> 17:33.467
That track has direct access
to the main road.

17:33.468 --> 17:34.987
Leads straight back to Newcastle.

17:34.988 --> 17:37.467
And we've got an ANPR grab
on that registration.

17:37.468 --> 17:40.400
- Right.
- 9:24pm on the Loxmere roundabout.

17:40.468 --> 17:43.467
The plates have been doctored.
Flagged up as a double-Decker bus.

17:43.468 --> 17:45.507
Kenny, get on to the local nick

17:45.508 --> 17:47.812
and ask them to make
a search of that area.

17:47.837 --> 17:48.943
Ma'am.

17:48.944 --> 17:52.467
Let's just assume
that Wilmott and his family

17:52.468 --> 17:55.107
were specifically targeted. Mm?

17:55.108 --> 17:56.467
So, what do we know about him?

17:56.468 --> 18:00.467
Ah, he started off with a chain of,
er, high street bookmakers.

18:00.468 --> 18:03.467
Expanded into online gambling
about 15 years ago.

18:03.468 --> 18:07.467
He's been accused of making money
by exploiting vulnerable customers,

18:07.468 --> 18:09.467
like low-income families,
problem gamblers.

18:09.468 --> 18:12.367
Well, it's a mug's game, eh, Kenny?

18:12.368 --> 18:14.467
Only when you're losing,
ma'am.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.467
Well, he was recently the target
of a hate mail campaign.

18:17.468 --> 18:18.468
Was he?

18:18.469 --> 18:20.267
Er, threatening emails,

18:20.291 --> 18:22.390
suspect packages
sent to the company offices.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.467
A report was made
to the police

18:24.468 --> 18:27.467
by the Director of Operations,
Orla Cossdale.

18:27.468 --> 18:29.467
Was anyone charged?

18:29.468 --> 18:32.217
Case was shelved due to lack of evidence.

18:32.218 --> 18:33.468
Well...

18:33.944 --> 18:36.284
Maybe we should to follow it up.

18:39.468 --> 18:43.123
So, what time did he leave
the stadium last night?

18:43.124 --> 18:44.467
Must have been around 8:30.

18:44.468 --> 18:47.987
And the race meet
was still in full swing?

18:47.988 --> 18:51.029
He'd been working too hard.
I told him I had things covered.

18:51.030 --> 18:52.987
Charity event, wasn't it?

18:52.988 --> 18:54.701
Gateshead Community Foundation.

18:54.702 --> 18:56.467
How long had you worked for him?

18:56.468 --> 18:58.467
Must be 10 years.

18:58.468 --> 19:01.467
Started on the phones, and
worked my way up through the ranks.

19:01.468 --> 19:04.468
Oh, so, he took a bit of a punt
on you, then, did he?

19:05.468 --> 19:08.147
Taught us everything I know
about the industry.

19:08.148 --> 19:13.468
Now, we know the company was
the target of a hate mail campaign.

19:14.260 --> 19:17.467
It started with threatening emails.

19:17.468 --> 19:21.467
Escalated to parcels
of white powder, broken glass.

19:21.468 --> 19:24.467
And you've no idea
who might've been behind it?

19:24.468 --> 19:27.467
I'd put money on a disgruntled punter.

19:27.468 --> 19:30.827
Anyone who's walked into a bookies
and gambled away a month's pay.

19:30.828 --> 19:34.468
But unpleasant... vindictive...

19:35.468 --> 19:38.467
and yet you asked the police
not to pursue it.

19:38.468 --> 19:40.987
We'd already increased security.

19:40.988 --> 19:43.308
And Alun thought it was best
if we dropped it.

19:44.368 --> 19:46.467
These emails,
do you have copies?

19:46.468 --> 19:49.467
You'll have to speak to Gareth.
He's our IT technician.

19:49.468 --> 19:50.927
He's in the office at the end.

19:50.928 --> 19:53.468
Oh. Right. Thanks, love.

20:00.988 --> 20:02.162
Mm.

20:02.163 --> 20:05.467
They were sent from a burner
account. Impossible to trace.

20:05.468 --> 20:08.467
"Alun Wilmott has blood on his hands."

20:08.468 --> 20:10.367
"OnTrack scum need to die."

20:10.368 --> 20:12.467
"We know where you live,
and we're coming for you."

20:12.468 --> 20:15.468
Ah, right, we've got the gist.

20:16.468 --> 20:18.468
This about his murder, then?

20:19.381 --> 20:21.901
Why, you got something
you want to share with us?

20:28.468 --> 20:30.467
Justice4Bookmakers.

20:30.468 --> 20:32.487
It's a...

20:32.688 --> 20:34.727
social media group
page for bookies

20:34.728 --> 20:36.567
who've been screwed over
by the industry.

20:36.568 --> 20:39.467
Plenty of inflammatory posts
about OnTrack.

20:39.468 --> 20:42.467
A lot of them by former employees.

20:42.468 --> 20:44.467
Hang on... hang on, what's that one?

20:44.468 --> 20:48.467
"Alun Wilmott has blood on his hands."

20:48.468 --> 20:50.307
Same wording. Same message.

20:50.308 --> 20:52.467
Who's that from? KathyB.

20:52.468 --> 20:55.467
Kathy Bennions. She managed
one of our bookies in Low Fell.

20:55.468 --> 20:56.667
Assaulted by a punter.

20:56.668 --> 20:58.468
She was assaulted?

20:59.468 --> 21:00.868
When was that?

21:02.368 --> 21:04.467
Must have been about a year ago now.

21:04.468 --> 21:07.467
Wilmott offered her
some risible compensation.

21:07.468 --> 21:09.787
He might have played
the benevolent businessman,

21:09.788 --> 21:11.567
but he didn't give a stuff
about his workers,

21:11.568 --> 21:13.568
as long as they were
making him money.

21:14.468 --> 21:18.467
OnTrack had introduced
a new company policy.

21:18.468 --> 21:19.988
"Single-manning".

21:21.468 --> 21:27.667
A recommendation... Orla Cossdale
came up with to save money.

21:27.668 --> 21:28.988
Here.

21:31.038 --> 21:33.668
Ah, we reported our concerns
to the unions, but

21:35.014 --> 21:36.468
didn't do any good.

21:38.319 --> 21:41.319
What happened that night,
if you don't me asking?

21:42.889 --> 21:44.289
The, er...

21:46.381 --> 21:49.656
shop was empty...
save for one of the regulars.

21:50.508 --> 21:53.468
You know, you get used to seeing
the same faces.

21:54.468 --> 21:57.468
He told us that one of
the machines weren't working, so

21:58.468 --> 22:02.468
I unlocked the counter
and came round to check it.

22:05.225 --> 22:07.458
That's when he hit us with a hammer.

22:08.468 --> 22:10.468
She hasn't worked since.

22:10.826 --> 22:12.486
Too scared to go out.

22:13.368 --> 22:15.467
Ronnie pops round
when she can.

22:15.468 --> 22:18.004
That must be a struggle,
when you've got a little one.

22:18.005 --> 22:20.217
Zak's no trouble, really.

22:21.577 --> 22:24.577
And you sued Alun Wilmott for damages.

22:25.668 --> 22:29.318
50 grand compensation!
With all his millions!

22:29.319 --> 22:31.147
Lawyers cost us more!

22:31.148 --> 22:34.788
Well, I can see why you might
have had a grievance, love.

22:36.468 --> 22:40.467
So, is that why you sent
those packages to head office?

22:40.468 --> 22:41.468
What?

22:41.469 --> 22:44.099
We also traced a series of
nuisance phone calls.

22:44.100 --> 22:48.467
All made to the Wilmott house,
from a phone box, 200 yards away.

22:48.468 --> 22:49.468
Mam?

22:50.468 --> 22:53.467
So, not quite housebound,
eh, pet?

22:53.468 --> 22:55.987
It was just a few emails.
I never sent no packages!

22:55.988 --> 22:57.567
What the hell
were you thinking?

22:57.568 --> 23:01.146
He thought he could buy me silence!
Someone had to make him pay.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.287
Well, maybe someone did, love.

23:03.288 --> 23:06.148
'Cause he was murdered last night.

23:09.178 --> 23:14.178
So, you can see why we're taking
these threats very seriously.

23:17.468 --> 23:21.468
You might want to get in touch
with that lawyer again, love.

23:32.468 --> 23:35.998
She had a cast iron motive
for going after Wilmott.

23:35.999 --> 23:37.843
Can't say I blame her.

23:37.844 --> 23:39.507
Though she's hardly in a fit state

23:39.508 --> 23:42.467
to go climbing over
anyone's garden fence.

23:42.468 --> 23:44.076
Here you are.

23:44.077 --> 23:48.467
"Local businessman, Royce Hobson,
has offered a reward of 25 grand

23:48.468 --> 23:51.943
"for any information regarding
Alun Wilmott's murder."

23:51.944 --> 23:53.468
That's all we need.

24:15.046 --> 24:18.467
You should have spoken to us first
before going public with this.

24:18.468 --> 24:20.667
Alun Wilmott was a personal friend
of mine.

24:20.668 --> 24:23.467
I'll do whatever it takes to catch
the people who did this.

24:23.468 --> 24:25.667
Oh, we'll catch 'em, love,
I can promise you that.

24:25.668 --> 24:28.467
But this just complicates things.

24:28.468 --> 24:32.468
We're holding a memorial fundraiser
in a few days over at the stadium.

24:33.020 --> 24:34.467
Proper send off.

24:34.468 --> 24:36.820
What? You'll not wait
till the fella's buried?

24:41.468 --> 24:44.147
You a regular, are you?
Down at the dog track?

24:44.148 --> 24:46.224
Alun sold us some shares
in the stadium.

24:46.225 --> 24:47.768
Generous of him.

24:48.508 --> 24:50.667
The place was on its arse.

24:50.668 --> 24:52.935
He was looking for trusted investors.

24:52.936 --> 24:55.951
Were you there last night,
this charity benefit?

24:55.952 --> 24:58.467
Never miss a meet if I can help it.

24:58.468 --> 25:01.468
So, how did Wilmott seem?

25:02.468 --> 25:04.568
He was on decent form.

25:05.668 --> 25:08.178
Working the room, as usual.

25:08.179 --> 25:09.974
Left early, didn't he?

25:09.975 --> 25:12.468
There was a shareholders' meeting
set up for this morning.

25:13.668 --> 25:14.828
Oh.

25:16.061 --> 25:17.904
And what's on the agenda?

25:17.905 --> 25:21.467
The falling share price
was an ongoing concern.

25:21.468 --> 25:24.468
There were rumours
of impending job losses.

25:25.170 --> 25:27.370
Betting industry's not what it was.

25:27.468 --> 25:32.467
Ah, well, we'd heard it'd had a bit
of bad publicity the last few months.

25:32.469 --> 25:35.988
The fine, you mean?
Alun took it as a personal slight.

25:37.268 --> 25:39.467
The fine? What fine's that, then?

25:39.468 --> 25:42.827
A rap on the knuckles
from the Gambling Commission.

25:42.828 --> 25:44.467
£2 million.

25:44.468 --> 25:47.068
Lost the company a sponsorship deal.

25:53.468 --> 25:54.667
Listen to this.

25:54.668 --> 25:56.467
OnTrack Bets.

25:56.468 --> 25:57.468
What?

25:57.469 --> 26:00.947
They were officially censured for
offering bonuses to problem gamblers.

26:00.988 --> 26:02.896
- Were they?
- Failure to perform

26:02.921 --> 26:04.675
social responsibility checks.

26:04.676 --> 26:07.214
Well, that's what you call
turning a blind eye!

26:07.215 --> 26:08.827
There's no proof
of any criminal intent.

26:08.828 --> 26:10.849
What, £2 million?

26:10.850 --> 26:12.507
They've got to have been
up to something.

26:12.508 --> 26:14.567
That sheds a new light
on Alun Wilmott.

26:14.568 --> 26:16.467
Aye, doesn't it just?

26:16.468 --> 26:18.668
Bit of a ruthless operator.

26:28.468 --> 26:31.467
Hang on! Not on the track.

26:31.468 --> 26:35.827
Oh, right, er... DCI Vera Stanhope.

26:35.828 --> 26:38.307
Looking for Orla Cossdale.

26:38.308 --> 26:39.467
Is this about Alun?

26:39.468 --> 26:43.467
Aye it is, love.
We're investigating his murder.

26:43.468 --> 26:45.668
News hasn't really sunk in yet.

26:46.468 --> 26:49.136
You know him personally, did you?

26:49.137 --> 26:51.714
I've been a kennel hand here
for 25 years.

26:51.715 --> 26:53.667
He always found time for a chat.

26:53.668 --> 26:56.147
Did you talk to him last night
at the benefit?

26:56.148 --> 27:00.467
Why, he came down to the track
for a photo call, you know.

27:00.468 --> 27:02.467
How did he seem?

27:02.468 --> 27:03.868
Worn out.

27:04.468 --> 27:06.467
Any reason for that?

27:06.468 --> 27:10.468
A man like Alun Wilmott,
everybody wanted a piece of him.

27:11.909 --> 27:14.429
She'll be up at the bar.
Top of the stands.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.088
Right, thanks, love.

27:45.468 --> 27:47.900
Thought you'd like an update.

27:48.308 --> 27:51.467
Now, that compo claim, Kathy Bennions.

27:51.468 --> 27:53.467
Yeah. What about it?

27:53.468 --> 27:57.468
Well, it's her, who's been sending
these emails.

27:58.828 --> 28:02.467
You must have known
she'd be harbouring a grudge?

28:02.468 --> 28:03.910
I knew she was trouble.

28:03.911 --> 28:07.147
Well, maybe she had cause
to be aggrieved, love.

28:07.148 --> 28:10.136
She was alone in the shop,
she was assaulted at work.

28:10.137 --> 28:12.467
The high-street bookmakers
don't earn their keep.

28:12.468 --> 28:14.567
We needed to cut costs.

28:16.086 --> 28:18.467
Well, that fine wouldn't have
helped, would it, love?

28:18.468 --> 28:20.467
£2 million quid?

28:20.468 --> 28:23.113
Failure to monitor problem gamblers?

28:23.114 --> 28:26.468
The fine was an oversight.
We updated our compliance policy.

28:27.248 --> 28:28.448
Right.

28:28.468 --> 28:31.467
Well, I'm going to need a list
of these problem punters.

28:31.468 --> 28:34.467
The accounts
will have been closed by now.

28:34.468 --> 28:36.968
All the personal details removed
from the database.

28:38.132 --> 28:40.780
So, if that's all,
I'm due at the Head Office.

28:51.468 --> 28:54.987
Oh, ma'am, I've been going through
those door-to-door statements.

28:54.988 --> 28:56.987
One of the neighbours
reported seeing a vehicle

28:56.988 --> 29:00.175
parked up outside the Wilmott house
on two separate occasions.

29:00.176 --> 29:02.700
- A blue BMW.
- When was this?

29:04.106 --> 29:05.467
Two weeks ago?

29:05.468 --> 29:06.927
Well, could've been
casing the house.

29:06.928 --> 29:10.467
She said that she'd passed on
the details to Ciaran Duggan.

29:10.468 --> 29:13.307
Well, why didn't he mention that?

29:13.308 --> 29:16.467
Funny you ask that, ma'am.
I've just run a background check.

29:16.468 --> 29:20.467
Ciaran Duggan, previous for ABH.

29:20.468 --> 29:22.667
Has he now?

29:22.668 --> 29:26.147
He would have been vetted,
wouldn't he? Criminal record check.

29:26.148 --> 29:28.467
Well, clearly he knows how to work
the system.

29:28.468 --> 29:31.467
Ma'am, I've been trawling through
that footage that they handed over.

29:31.469 --> 29:34.467
So, according to the log,
Ryan Derring did a drive past

29:34.468 --> 29:36.467
the Wilmott house at 20:55.

29:36.468 --> 29:37.827
Yes, he told us that.

29:37.828 --> 29:40.507
There's nothing on the camera
that verifies that.

29:40.508 --> 29:42.567
So, either Ryan got his times wrong...

29:42.568 --> 29:45.168
Or he lied to us about
his movements that night.

29:46.233 --> 29:48.873
So this could be an inside job.

30:01.268 --> 30:02.468
Have you got a minute?

30:02.469 --> 30:04.467
I'm late for a shift
at the Retail Park.

30:04.468 --> 30:07.228
We need to clarify that statement
that you gave us.

30:08.268 --> 30:09.468
What about it?

30:09.469 --> 30:11.467
Well, it didn't stack up,
that's what!

30:11.468 --> 30:14.769
Now, if you'd driven past the house
at the time you said you did,

30:14.770 --> 30:17.847
you'd have seen Alun Wilmott
returning home.

30:17.848 --> 30:21.996
I was parked up on Millerton Lane.
Must have dozed off.

30:21.997 --> 30:24.730
I'm working double shifts
at the minute, all right?

30:24.731 --> 30:26.925
Maintenance payments
for a kid I never see.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.246
What, so you lied
about your movements?

30:29.247 --> 30:31.667
I got a call saying Wilmott
had been killed on my watch.

30:31.668 --> 30:34.667
All I did was fill in the logs
and keep quiet about it.

30:34.668 --> 30:38.827
Look, if the boss finds out
about this, I'm finished here.

30:38.828 --> 30:41.793
And if I find out you've been lying
to me again, son,

30:41.794 --> 30:44.280
that's gonna be
the least of your worries.

30:51.628 --> 30:53.467
Any reason you're
harassing my staff?

30:53.468 --> 30:56.467
Just a couple of follow up questions,
that's hardly harassment.

30:56.468 --> 30:59.467
Night of the break-in,
you said you went inside the house.

30:59.468 --> 31:01.267
I checked the body for a pulse.

31:01.291 --> 31:04.436
Made sure the property was clear, then
I went outside and called an ambulance.

31:04.468 --> 31:07.467
- Yeah, did you touch anything else?
- Not that I remember.

31:07.468 --> 31:10.468
So how come your prints are
all over the house?

31:12.296 --> 31:14.296
I might have
opened the patio doors.

31:14.468 --> 31:17.467
Ah, you installed the alarm system,
hmm?

31:17.468 --> 31:19.467
So you'd know
the layout of the place.

31:19.468 --> 31:21.307
The location of the safe.

31:21.308 --> 31:22.987
It's my business to know.

31:22.988 --> 31:26.827
Ah, now that's the thing that's been
niggling me, love.

31:26.828 --> 31:28.467
Mm-hm?

31:28.468 --> 31:30.467
The alarm system was down that night.

31:30.468 --> 31:34.467
So either security didn't do
their job properly,

31:34.468 --> 31:36.769
or else someone
was looking the other way.

31:36.770 --> 31:38.467
You're trying to pin this on me?

31:38.468 --> 31:42.667
Previous for ABH.
Bet that's not on your website!

31:42.668 --> 31:44.214
That were over ten year ago.

31:44.215 --> 31:46.082
Oh, reformed character?

31:46.083 --> 31:47.467
I don't think so,
love.

31:47.468 --> 31:50.467
Not if that bogus accreditation
is anything to go by.

31:50.468 --> 31:52.467
I built this business up from nothing.

31:52.468 --> 31:54.467
You think I'd throw it all away
for a burglary?

31:54.468 --> 31:57.467
I think you're the sort of fella who
likes to throw his weight around!

31:57.468 --> 32:00.105
We've even got a neighbour said
you'd threatened her son.

32:00.106 --> 32:02.199
I caught him hanging around
outside the Wilmott house.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.467
Not the first time,
neither.

32:03.468 --> 32:06.467
We've also got a statement
from another neighbour...

32:06.468 --> 32:10.667
who said she reported a car parked
up outside the Wilmott's house.

32:10.668 --> 32:12.467
Blue BMW.
Followed it up myself.

32:12.468 --> 32:14.868
She said she was visiting someone.

32:16.019 --> 32:17.467
Driver was a woman?

32:17.468 --> 32:20.467
Late 40s, dark hair,
disabled badge in the window.

32:20.468 --> 32:23.468
You know, she didn't look the type
to be breaking into houses.

32:26.468 --> 32:30.467
Right, well, we found some of his
prints on the patio door frame,

32:30.468 --> 32:31.468
on a couple of
kitchen drawers,

32:31.469 --> 32:33.804
but they may well have been left
there when he entered the house.

32:33.805 --> 32:36.900
So, stacks up with what Duggan told us.

32:38.374 --> 32:40.131
Any other prints
I should know about?

32:40.156 --> 32:41.810
None that haven't
been accounted for,

32:41.835 --> 32:46.104
but we did get a lift off some gloves.

32:46.148 --> 32:47.467
Dot grips.

32:47.468 --> 32:49.467
Ah, yeah, I wear those
when I'm weeding.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.467
Well, burglars get careless wearing
them, because what you won't know

32:52.468 --> 32:55.467
is they leave an impression
as unique as a fingerprint.

32:55.468 --> 32:57.304
Yeah, I knew that.

32:57.305 --> 32:58.868
Of course you did.

33:01.335 --> 33:04.335
So, what about the post-mortem,
Malcolm, what can you tell us?

33:04.360 --> 33:06.880
Well, the bullet hit his chest bone,
shattered on impact,

33:06.905 --> 33:09.385
so there's nothing for ballistics
to work with.

33:09.410 --> 33:11.410
But something didn't stack up.

33:11.468 --> 33:13.507
- What?
- Well, the trajectory.

33:13.508 --> 33:15.265
The angle of the impact.

33:15.266 --> 33:18.827
According to those witness statements,
the gun went off during a struggle.

33:18.891 --> 33:22.467
Yeah, well, that's what Jess,
the daughter, told us.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.467
Well, the entry wound
was clean and round.

33:24.468 --> 33:28.468
That tattooing on his shirt, it suggests
to me the shot was carefully aimed.

33:28.468 --> 33:32.467
Sees him in the hallway,
points the gun, fires.

33:32.468 --> 33:34.307
Clear shot?

33:34.308 --> 33:35.968
Nice and tidy.

34:08.467 --> 34:12.308
Makes you realise just how little
you actually need.

34:14.327 --> 34:16.327
How's Jess bearing up?

34:16.739 --> 34:18.219
You tell me.

34:18.244 --> 34:20.377
Ah, well, she's grieving.

34:22.467 --> 34:25.467
Alun always indulged her.

34:25.467 --> 34:27.668
Past few months,
they'd not been getting on.

34:30.467 --> 34:33.467
And why was that,
if you don't mind my asking?

34:33.467 --> 34:36.467
Jess started staying out late.
God knows who with.

34:36.467 --> 34:39.467
Answering back. Bit of a mouth on her.

34:39.467 --> 34:42.147
Ah, well. No telling 'em at that age.

34:42.148 --> 34:45.467
Alun said she never understand
the value of money.

34:45.467 --> 34:47.467
Even threatened
to cut off her allowance.

34:47.889 --> 34:49.569
Did he?

34:50.467 --> 34:52.567
Oh, er...

34:52.668 --> 34:57.467
I found out who'd been
making those anonymous phone calls.

34:57.468 --> 35:00.420
Woman called Kathy Bennions.

35:01.143 --> 35:02.443
I know who she is.

35:02.468 --> 35:05.467
Oh, well, then you'll know
about the assault.

35:05.468 --> 35:08.467
Alun was gutted when he found out
what had happened.

35:08.468 --> 35:10.987
Did his best to put things right.

35:10.988 --> 35:13.600
He paid her that money
out of his own pocket.

35:15.140 --> 35:18.890
You're not saying that she had
anything to do with this?

35:18.891 --> 35:21.468
Ah, we're still following it up, love.

35:29.148 --> 35:32.308
- I'll walk you to the car.
- I think I know the way, thanks.

35:39.468 --> 35:42.468
Ma'am. Something I noticed
when she started packing.

35:46.468 --> 35:49.202
None of her husband's clothes
are in here.

35:49.203 --> 35:51.828
All his stuff is in a bedroom
across the way.

35:54.468 --> 35:55.868
Separate rooms.

35:58.668 --> 36:00.467
- Boss?
- What?

36:00.468 --> 36:02.116
That blue BMW.

36:02.117 --> 36:05.147
We can rule out Kathy Bennions
as the woman in the car.

36:05.148 --> 36:06.868
She doesn't drive.

36:07.848 --> 36:09.467
Looking for anything
in particular?

36:09.468 --> 36:12.467
Well, Malcolm reckons Jess's statement

36:12.468 --> 36:14.467
is at odds with these finding.

36:14.468 --> 36:17.273
And I got the impression she was
holding something back.

36:17.274 --> 36:20.288
Well, her dad had just been shot.
She can't be thinking straight.

36:20.289 --> 36:24.988
Plus, her mam thinks she's going
through a rebellious stage.

36:45.468 --> 36:49.467
Did you know Adam had been watching
the Wilmott house?

36:49.468 --> 36:51.467
Surveillance, he calls it.

36:51.468 --> 36:54.023
He was worried the police
were gonna hurt Jess.

36:54.024 --> 36:57.929
Oh, and by "police", you mean
Ciaran Duggan and his heavies.

36:57.930 --> 37:00.467
Adam has a tendency
to form close attachments.

37:00.468 --> 37:04.508
And did he form a close attachment
to Jess Wilmott?

37:06.268 --> 37:08.467
Adam sees the world differently
to other kids.

37:08.468 --> 37:10.874
People tend to misjudge his behaviour,

37:10.875 --> 37:14.467
- when it's all perfectly innocent.
- I'm not judging him, love.

37:14.468 --> 37:17.148
But you should have been straight
with us.

37:25.468 --> 37:27.468
I wish I'd had one of these
when I was your age.

37:37.468 --> 37:39.468
Is Jess in prison?

37:41.268 --> 37:43.467
What makes you think that, love?

37:43.468 --> 37:46.467
They took her away in a police car.

37:46.468 --> 37:49.468
Aye, not much gets past you, does it?

37:51.128 --> 37:53.288
I've been doing my own patrols.

37:53.313 --> 37:57.313
So, er, do you wanna tell us
what you've found out?

37:57.468 --> 38:00.467
He was in Jess' bedroom.

38:00.468 --> 38:03.467
- Who?
- The policeman. I saw them.

38:03.468 --> 38:05.828
Was this the night of the burglary?

38:06.179 --> 38:07.819
Day before.

38:10.468 --> 38:12.702
Would you recognise this fella again?

38:12.703 --> 38:15.467
Jess say's it was our secret.

38:15.468 --> 38:16.908
OK.

38:19.468 --> 38:21.468
She tell you his name?

38:32.268 --> 38:34.507
The police have been
asking us questions.

38:34.508 --> 38:37.467
Is that why you wanted to see me?

38:37.468 --> 38:40.468
- What have you told them, Jess?
- Nothing.

38:42.468 --> 38:44.668
I didn't tell him anything!

38:52.468 --> 38:55.780
Take your time, Adam.
He can't see or hear you.

39:00.828 --> 39:02.568
Good lad. OK.

39:05.308 --> 39:07.468
DCI Stanhope has entered the room.

39:09.508 --> 39:13.667
Right, Jess Wilmott's phone records.

39:13.668 --> 39:17.467
And messages to your mobile.

39:17.468 --> 39:21.147
Yeah, we'd been messaging. So what?

39:21.148 --> 39:24.827
Oh, I think things have moved on
from texting, love,

39:24.828 --> 39:30.179
'cause we have a witness who can
place you inside the Wilmott house.

39:30.180 --> 39:33.179
More precisely, in Jess's bedroom,

39:33.180 --> 39:35.868
just the day before her dad was killed.

39:35.980 --> 39:38.467
That little creep's
been spying on us, has he?

39:38.468 --> 39:43.718
Mm. Which makes us wonder
what else it is you've been up to,

39:43.719 --> 39:45.827
apart from the obvious.

39:45.828 --> 39:49.007
Maybe casing the place
for a burglary, mm?

39:49.008 --> 39:53.267
Memorising the alarm code,
clocking where the safe is.

39:53.268 --> 39:55.507
What? You think I had something
to do with the break-in?

39:55.508 --> 39:57.987
You told us yourself
you were strapped for cash.

39:57.988 --> 39:59.467
Those child maintenance
payments.

39:59.468 --> 40:02.467
Oh, another poor lass
who'd succumb to your charms.

40:02.468 --> 40:04.467
I had nothing to do with it!

40:04.468 --> 40:07.740
Did you see Jess Wilmott
on the night of the murder?

40:12.468 --> 40:15.467
We met up in The Bailer, early doors.

40:15.468 --> 40:18.147
Just before I started me shift.

40:18.148 --> 40:21.468
Now, did she tell you her dad
had gone out for the night?

40:22.988 --> 40:24.467
She might've mentioned it.

40:24.468 --> 40:26.667
Did you give the heads-up to your mates?

40:26.668 --> 40:29.467
- No!
- No? Well, that's strange,

40:29.468 --> 40:31.467
because not two hours later,

40:31.468 --> 40:35.468
those intruders had broken
into the house on your watch,

40:35.983 --> 40:39.983
while you just happened
to have fallen asleep at the wheel.

40:41.468 --> 40:43.468
Me and Jess had a bit of a barney.

40:46.308 --> 40:48.210
I was in the pub until closing time.

40:48.211 --> 40:50.467
Yeah, because you knew what was
going down that night.

40:50.468 --> 40:53.467
Do you think that
I would have let her leave, hey?

40:53.468 --> 40:56.233
Knowing there was a fella
with a gun in the house?

40:56.234 --> 40:57.968
Lover's tiff, was it?

40:59.468 --> 41:02.828
I told her
that I wanted to finish things.

41:04.468 --> 41:07.467
She got upset. Stormed off home.

41:07.468 --> 41:11.507
Now, then, we've found a couple
of grand in your bank account.

41:11.508 --> 41:15.667
Cash deposit, just three days ago.

41:15.668 --> 41:17.668
You said you were skint!

41:19.468 --> 41:22.468
Jess told her dad that we were
getting a place together.

41:23.468 --> 41:25.908
No idea where that one came from.

41:28.468 --> 41:32.987
I'm working the evening patrol.
Parked up in the street.

41:32.988 --> 41:35.467
And Wilmott taps on the window.
Calm as you like.

41:35.468 --> 41:37.827
Tells us how everything's
gonna play out.

41:37.828 --> 41:40.467
Tells us that I should walk away
from Jess.

41:40.468 --> 41:42.100
Tells us that I need to leave me job.

41:43.828 --> 41:45.468
Then...

41:47.350 --> 41:50.350
then he hands us an envelope
full of cash.

41:50.468 --> 41:54.467
OK, so, there you were,
in the pub, all night,

41:54.468 --> 41:59.308
drowning your sorrows
and spending Wilmott's bribe money.

42:01.828 --> 42:04.980
I got a call around closing time.

42:06.468 --> 42:09.308
And that was the first thing I heard
about the murder.

42:11.468 --> 42:15.308
Did Jess know her dad
had given you a bung?

42:16.343 --> 42:18.220
She worshipped her dad.

42:20.678 --> 42:22.978
I wasn't about to burst her bubble.

42:25.268 --> 42:27.467
He was always so
wrapped up in the business,

42:27.468 --> 42:30.467
he's never, ever had time for any of us.

42:30.468 --> 42:33.467
Oh, so, was that why you mentioned
you'd met someone,

42:33.468 --> 42:35.468
to get his attention?

42:36.342 --> 42:37.580
Maybe.

42:38.468 --> 42:40.988
Come on, love, help me here.

42:43.468 --> 42:46.467
When he found out about me and Ryan...

42:46.468 --> 42:49.467
And suddenly,
he started taking an interest.

42:49.468 --> 42:52.467
Where was I going,
what time I would come home.

42:52.468 --> 42:55.308
It was like he wanted to keep us
locked up.

42:56.828 --> 43:00.308
Look, I am sorry to have to ask
you this, love

43:01.468 --> 43:05.468
but did you find out that your dad
had paid Ryan off?

43:06.368 --> 43:08.467
No, I don't believe you.

43:08.468 --> 43:10.567
My dad would never
have done anything like that.

43:10.568 --> 43:12.467
Oh, he did.

43:12.468 --> 43:15.467
So did you try to get
your own back on him, hmm?

43:15.468 --> 43:19.147
You told Ryan your dad
was going out that night

43:19.148 --> 43:21.467
and there was money in that house.

43:21.468 --> 43:23.126
- No.
- Now, we know Ryan

43:23.151 --> 43:24.952
had been to the house.

43:26.956 --> 43:28.116
No?

43:29.936 --> 43:31.336
Oh, well.

43:34.468 --> 43:40.468
Now, you said in your statement
that the gun went off in a struggle.

43:42.194 --> 43:44.394
Did you see the shot fired?

43:50.468 --> 43:52.768
My dad was out in the hall.

43:53.828 --> 43:56.468
The fella with the gun
went out to meet him.

43:57.468 --> 44:00.171
I tried to warn him,
but then the other one grabbed me,

44:00.172 --> 44:02.508
and that's when I heard the shot.

44:03.163 --> 44:07.163
You just heard the shot?
You didn't see it?

44:23.165 --> 44:24.885
Ryan's alibi checks out.

44:24.910 --> 44:27.190
He was propping up the bar
until closing.

44:27.215 --> 44:28.615
Bit of a regular
by all accounts.

44:28.668 --> 44:30.827
Doesn't mean he wasn't involved.

44:30.828 --> 44:32.467
Set up his mates for the burglary.

44:32.468 --> 44:36.467
So what if we've been looking
at this the wrong way, mm?

44:36.468 --> 44:39.467
He hadn't been himself for
the past few weeks,

44:39.468 --> 44:41.467
paranoid about security.

44:41.468 --> 44:45.468
Cameras, new alarm systems,
neighbourhood watch.

44:46.976 --> 44:48.996
Now, what does that tell us?

44:49.268 --> 44:50.952
Someone was out to get him.

44:50.953 --> 44:52.668
Victim of a hit?

44:52.920 --> 44:54.120
Right.

45:18.468 --> 45:21.773
- He certainly gets around.
- Oh, staff meeting, is it?

45:21.774 --> 45:25.467
We were just reviewing security.
Alun Wilmott's memorial fundraiser.

45:25.468 --> 45:29.468
Ah, well, you can't be too careful.
Not in light of recent events.

45:31.875 --> 45:35.467
Oh, by the way, we pulled in
Ryan Derring for questioning.

45:35.468 --> 45:39.147
He lied on his statement
about his movements that night.

45:39.148 --> 45:42.828
Which makes me wonder what else
it is you're all hiding.

45:54.671 --> 45:56.411
Can we come in?

46:00.042 --> 46:01.467
Another update?

46:01.468 --> 46:04.307
Ah, well, you could say that, love.

46:04.308 --> 46:08.467
Er, see, we're pursuing the possibility

46:08.468 --> 46:11.467
that Alun Wilmott's murder
was premeditated.

46:11.468 --> 46:14.088
Just dressed up to look like a burglary.

46:15.268 --> 46:16.827
So why are you talking to me?

46:16.828 --> 46:21.220
Because you told us yourself
that security had been stepped up.

46:21.858 --> 46:24.340
This cosy arrangement
with Ciaran Duggan.

46:24.468 --> 46:26.868
So he must have known
there was a tangible threat.

46:31.358 --> 46:33.358
Our operating system was hacked.

46:33.468 --> 46:37.093
A denial of service attack.
Customer accounts were compromised.

46:37.094 --> 46:39.624
A few hours later, we received a threat.

46:39.625 --> 46:42.620
Another attack was imminent,
unless we paid a ransom.

46:43.828 --> 46:46.148
How much were they asking for?

46:47.097 --> 46:48.557
50,000.

46:48.694 --> 46:51.794
Who else in the company knew about this?

46:52.368 --> 46:54.467
Apart from Alun and myself...

46:54.468 --> 46:57.467
um, his PA, Ciaran Duggan,

46:57.468 --> 47:02.069
and, er, a couple of the employees
from internet security.

47:02.070 --> 47:04.467
Any money change hands?

47:04.468 --> 47:06.467
Alun said he didn't want to
give in to blackmail.

47:06.468 --> 47:12.467
Ah, but you, on the other hand,
had no such qualms. Mm?

47:12.468 --> 47:16.468
Paid up anyway behind
the boss's back, am I right?

47:18.468 --> 47:21.220
I thought the threat
had been dealt with.

47:21.633 --> 47:24.113
But they came back and
asked us for twice as much.

47:24.137 --> 47:25.437
When was this?

47:25.438 --> 47:28.438
A few days ago. But this time,
I said I wouldn't pay.

47:28.468 --> 47:31.467
And you thought you'd keep
this little nugget to yourself

47:31.468 --> 47:33.668
in the face of a murder enquiry?

47:49.468 --> 47:52.667
Oh...
am I disturbing you, pet?

47:52.668 --> 47:54.467
I was just having me dinner.

47:54.468 --> 47:58.308
Right, well, you going to invite us in?

48:11.210 --> 48:13.210
Sorry about the mess.

48:20.468 --> 48:22.468
Toon Tipster?

48:23.468 --> 48:27.155
I, um...
I do a bit of moonlighting.

48:27.156 --> 48:28.960
Online pundit.

48:28.985 --> 48:31.140
What, insider tips?

48:32.468 --> 48:34.268
Quantitative analysis.

48:35.368 --> 48:37.467
Say we're looking at some horseflesh.

48:37.468 --> 48:40.987
We feed the runner's stats
into the computer.

48:40.988 --> 48:43.468
Speed, power, form and handicap.

48:44.468 --> 48:47.467
This system details over
a hundred different variables

48:47.468 --> 48:49.468
in order to predict race outcomes.

48:49.508 --> 48:51.920
I pick out the most profitable bets.

48:52.468 --> 48:56.467
What, and then you pass all that
knowledge onto your punters, right?

48:56.468 --> 48:59.468
- In return for a small premium.
- Ooh!

49:05.304 --> 49:07.304
So, why the home visit?

49:09.468 --> 49:12.467
OnTrack accounts system
was recently hacked.

49:12.468 --> 49:15.467
- You must've known about that. Hmm?
- Hmm.

49:15.468 --> 49:18.085
Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack.

49:18.086 --> 49:22.467
A network of zombie PCs infected
with Trojan horse backdoor tools.

49:22.468 --> 49:26.467
They can be remotely directed
to packet a targeted online suspect

49:26.468 --> 49:27.667
with spurious traffic.

49:27.668 --> 49:30.467
You lost me at Trojan horses, love.

49:30.468 --> 49:32.467
A few thousand up front
can get rid of the threat.

49:32.468 --> 49:34.868
Either that,
or you risk losing millions.

49:35.999 --> 49:39.319
And is there any way of tracing
who was behind it?

49:39.468 --> 49:42.467
It's usually organised crime.
Gangs in Eastern Europe.

49:42.468 --> 49:44.467
They're experts
at covering their tracks.

49:44.468 --> 49:47.467
This fine by the Gambling Commission,

49:47.468 --> 49:51.307
OnTrack customers pegged
with being problem gamblers.

49:51.308 --> 49:54.467
You must have their names
on your database, hmm?

49:54.468 --> 49:57.467
- I should be able to find them.
- Excellent.

49:57.468 --> 50:00.668
So you'll be able to give me
all their details.

50:04.468 --> 50:07.467
Right, listen up everyone.

50:07.468 --> 50:12.727
Now, Alun Wilmott was the victim
of an online extortion plot.

50:12.728 --> 50:14.467
A dressed-up
protection racket.

50:14.468 --> 50:17.467
Now, we could be looking at
organised crime,

50:17.468 --> 50:20.467
but whoever it was, he refused to pay up.

50:20.468 --> 50:23.467
Jac, get onto the Cyber Crime Unit,

50:23.468 --> 50:27.467
see if they can put a trace on that, mm?

50:27.468 --> 50:30.467
Meanwhile, Kenny,
check out this list of people.

50:30.468 --> 50:32.167
They're problem gamblers.

50:32.168 --> 50:34.827
See if there's any connection,
money laundering, drugs,

50:34.828 --> 50:36.467
or anyone you wouldn't
want to mess with.

50:36.468 --> 50:39.467
Er, ma'am?
That Blue BMW you asked us to trace,

50:39.468 --> 50:41.467
I've got a fix on some plates.

50:41.468 --> 50:43.667
Owner's registered as Wilma Howland.

50:43.668 --> 50:46.467
A business address in Wallsend.

50:46.468 --> 50:48.768
It's listed as a Private Investigators.

50:49.468 --> 50:50.468
What?

50:50.940 --> 50:54.245
Your car was witnessed
on a couple of occasions

50:54.246 --> 50:56.468
parked up outside Alun Wilmott's house.

50:56.827 --> 50:58.227
Blue BMW.

50:59.468 --> 51:00.468
Hmm.

51:00.469 --> 51:02.467
Gonna tell us why?

51:02.468 --> 51:05.467
I was out on a job. Basic surveillance.

51:05.468 --> 51:06.987
Mm...

51:06.988 --> 51:09.660
So, who were you keeping tabs on?

51:10.219 --> 51:12.319
I'm not obliged to share
that information.

51:12.344 --> 51:14.184
Look, he's dead, love.

51:14.209 --> 51:18.860
So cut the flannel, and I'll turn
a blind eye to that disabled badge.

51:21.468 --> 51:24.827
Alun Wilmott hired me to follow his wife.

51:24.828 --> 51:26.987
Now, why would he want to do that?

51:26.988 --> 51:29.628
Well, he suspected
she was playing away.

51:29.999 --> 51:31.739
And was she?

51:34.508 --> 51:40.467
Louise Wilmott's private life
was... fairly mundane.

51:40.468 --> 51:42.467
Didn't get out much...

51:42.468 --> 51:46.467
aside from regular visits
to South Shields.

51:46.468 --> 51:49.940
- That's where her mum lives.
- Yes, Trethaway Street.

51:49.941 --> 51:53.148
Turned out her mam was covering for her.

51:54.468 --> 51:57.467
I found out her secret soon enough.

51:57.468 --> 51:59.467
Gave my client a full report,

51:59.468 --> 52:01.468
and advised him to drop the case.

52:02.999 --> 52:04.999
So, are you gonna enlighten us?

52:06.468 --> 52:11.468
Tuesdays and Thursdays.
St Kea's Church Hall.

52:25.468 --> 52:29.468
It's been two days
since my husband was murdered.

52:32.170 --> 52:33.370
And...

52:35.828 --> 52:37.668
I really need a drink.

52:37.780 --> 52:39.980
This is a closed meeting

52:40.343 --> 52:43.343
so, I... I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

52:43.468 --> 52:46.468
It's OK. I know her.

52:52.878 --> 52:55.358
So, how long have you been clean?

52:56.373 --> 52:59.373
- 6 months.
- Hey, that's good.

53:00.654 --> 53:02.854
With the help of my support group.

53:04.303 --> 53:08.580
They had no idea who I was married
to, and they really didn't care.

53:10.327 --> 53:13.847
Did your husband
know about these meetings?

53:13.878 --> 53:16.358
- No, he didn't.
- Hmm.

53:16.383 --> 53:18.383
Why d'you ask?

53:19.468 --> 53:21.268
Well...

53:22.668 --> 53:26.467
because he'd been
having you followed, love.

53:26.468 --> 53:27.968
Private detective.

53:32.100 --> 53:35.540
Alun always hated the idea of me
airing dirty linen.

53:37.335 --> 53:39.820
I'd already embarrassed him
at too many functions.

53:41.468 --> 53:43.868
It was easier to leave me at home.

53:45.327 --> 53:48.847
Now, a couple of witnesses have told us

53:48.872 --> 53:52.032
that your husband
hadn't been himself lately.

53:55.468 --> 53:58.467
We'd been living separate lives
for a while.

53:58.468 --> 54:00.467
I'm not sure
he would have confided in me.

54:00.468 --> 54:03.467
So there's nothing
you can tell us that...

54:03.468 --> 54:06.308
might've been ringing alarm bells?

54:07.186 --> 54:09.340
Work always came first.

54:12.229 --> 54:15.389
He was worried that one day,
it would all come crashing down.

54:19.508 --> 54:23.467
Ma'am, we've had a breakthrough.
They've found the stolen motorbike.

54:23.468 --> 54:25.468
Oh, at last!

54:41.082 --> 54:43.467
Malcolm, tell me
you've got something.

54:43.468 --> 54:46.467
They did make a decent attempt
to destroy the evidence.

54:46.468 --> 54:49.827
Unlikely we'll lift
any finger prints or DNA,

54:49.828 --> 54:52.467
but there is a ray of light.

54:52.468 --> 54:55.307
The letters on this plate
have been altered.

54:55.308 --> 54:58.467
- Someone turned the L into an E.
- Well, I could have told you that!

54:58.468 --> 55:02.467
Using black insulation tape.
Impossible to handle with gloves on.

55:02.468 --> 55:05.467
We picked up latent prints
from the sticky side.

55:05.468 --> 55:08.308
And they gave us a match
on the PNC.

55:11.468 --> 55:13.067
Leon Wilson.

55:13.068 --> 55:15.507
Yeah, he's got previous for
possession with intent to supply.

55:15.508 --> 55:17.567
He was pulled in 12 months ago.

55:17.568 --> 55:19.668
Address unknown.

55:20.828 --> 55:23.178
- Leon Wilson?
- Aye.

55:23.179 --> 55:26.060
His name's on this list
of problem gamblers, ma'am.

55:26.085 --> 55:28.085
There's our connection to Wilmott.

55:28.110 --> 55:32.330
So OnTrack
must have his personal details.

55:32.988 --> 55:35.308
No, there's nothing there.

55:41.468 --> 55:43.908
Aiden, with me.

55:59.468 --> 56:02.467
Mrs Wilmott, can we have a word?

56:02.468 --> 56:03.968
Of course, come in.

56:10.468 --> 56:14.467
I think we might be getting
somewhere with the intruders.

56:14.468 --> 56:19.467
Um... does the name Leon Wilson
mean anything to you?

56:19.468 --> 56:20.967
Leon Wilson?

56:20.968 --> 56:24.467
My dad took him on.
He helped out in the garden.

56:24.468 --> 56:26.827
I thought the gardener
had been accounted for?

56:26.828 --> 56:30.468
Sometimes he'd need a little help.
Heavy lifting.

56:31.327 --> 56:33.580
So how long had this lad worked for you?

56:35.350 --> 56:37.350
6 months, on and off.

56:37.375 --> 56:40.115
He didn't turn up for a shift,
that was the last we saw of him.

56:40.140 --> 56:43.700
So, is that where you got your weed from?

56:44.468 --> 56:46.084
Drugs?

56:46.085 --> 56:49.467
Look, I just want to know
when he was up at the house, love.

56:49.468 --> 56:52.467
I might have scored off him
once or twice.

56:52.468 --> 56:53.987
Hadn't seen him in weeks.

56:53.988 --> 56:57.467
Well, if he was on the payroll,
you'll have an address.

56:57.468 --> 56:59.827
Alun always paid him cash in hand.

56:59.828 --> 57:02.148
Like I said, it was casual labour.

57:04.468 --> 57:06.467
He brought his son to work once.

57:06.468 --> 57:08.868
I remember him playing in the garden.

57:09.468 --> 57:11.468
I think his name was Zak.

57:20.468 --> 57:22.367
Jac, Mark...

57:22.468 --> 57:24.468
round the back.

57:35.468 --> 57:37.948
It's the police.
Can you open up, please?

57:42.668 --> 57:45.467
What? You can't just barge in here!

57:45.468 --> 57:48.507
Can you step outside, love?
Come on, Zak. Out you come.

57:48.508 --> 57:51.468
- There's a good lad.
- Mum?

58:09.468 --> 58:12.147
All rooms check out clear, ma'am.

58:12.148 --> 58:13.568
No sign, ma'am.

58:14.468 --> 58:16.467
So, where is he, love?

58:16.468 --> 58:18.468
I have no idea.

58:41.468 --> 58:43.467
She's just grieving, love.

58:43.468 --> 58:46.467
And I'm not? I miss him so much, Nan.

58:46.468 --> 58:48.468
I know love, I know.

59:12.015 --> 59:14.827
Alun Wilmott's watch.

59:14.828 --> 59:19.467
Now, that was stolen from his house
on the night that he was murdered.

59:19.468 --> 59:22.820
So, how did it end up in
your biscuit tin?

59:26.727 --> 59:29.207
If I'd have known it was there,
I would have dumped it.

59:30.828 --> 59:35.467
Now, we know Leon did a bit of
gardening for the Wilmotts.

59:35.468 --> 59:37.186
He packed in the job
a few weeks ago.

59:37.187 --> 59:39.568
Oh, got in the way of the bookies,
did it?

59:39.660 --> 59:41.820
Leon doesn't gamble any more.

59:41.845 --> 59:44.325
Well, that's very wise, love, because

59:45.468 --> 59:48.467
he's nearly six grand in debt.

59:48.468 --> 59:51.468
Ran it up after OnTrack
extended his credit.

59:52.311 --> 59:56.671
Oh, and we also found
his gardening gloves.

59:56.828 --> 59:58.467
Kitchen cupboard.

59:58.468 --> 01:00:01.900
Now, the impressions on the tips

01:00:01.929 --> 01:00:05.340
match those found at the murder scene.

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:08.030
Doesn't mean he was there.

01:00:08.055 --> 01:00:09.895
Ah, that's true that.

01:00:09.988 --> 01:00:11.468
But...

01:00:12.468 --> 01:00:16.467
this here is a tape
used to tamper with

01:00:16.468 --> 01:00:18.467
the number plates on the getaway bike.

01:00:18.468 --> 01:00:22.147
And Leon's finger prints are all over it.

01:00:22.148 --> 01:00:24.467
Leon did not kill anyone.

01:00:24.468 --> 01:00:27.967
So did he take that job
so he could case the house?

01:00:27.968 --> 01:00:29.671
Alun Wilmott
offered Leon that job!

01:00:29.696 --> 01:00:31.811
Now, why would he go and do that?

01:00:31.812 --> 01:00:33.467
He got in touch with us 
after the trial.

01:00:33.468 --> 01:00:35.467
Thought he was making amends.

01:00:35.468 --> 01:00:38.467
I told Leon not to take it,
but he said he needed the money.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:41.667
You knew Leon was wrapped up
in that burglary,

01:00:41.668 --> 01:00:44.467
and you just sat there
when we talked to your mam,

01:00:44.468 --> 01:00:46.367
and you didn't say a word.

01:00:46.368 --> 01:00:48.467
I didn't know he'd got himself
mixed up in a murder!

01:00:48.468 --> 01:00:51.068
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:54.582
He came home late that night.

01:00:55.468 --> 01:00:57.468
Pocket full of money.

01:00:58.049 --> 01:00:59.827
Said he needed to
lie low for a while.

01:00:59.828 --> 01:01:03.467
Left first thing next morning.
I haven't heard from him since.

01:01:03.468 --> 01:01:05.987
So who else was involved?

01:01:05.988 --> 01:01:07.467
He must have told you.

01:01:07.468 --> 01:01:10.468
He said it was best
if I didn't know anything.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:14.467
I don't believe you, love.

01:01:14.468 --> 01:01:16.308
He was frightened.

01:01:19.892 --> 01:01:22.092
More scared than I've ever seen him.

01:02:22.804 --> 01:02:25.124
Hi, can I have quick word, please?

01:02:31.186 --> 01:02:33.080
Patched you up, then?

01:02:34.468 --> 01:02:36.367
Mild concussion.

01:02:36.468 --> 01:02:39.467
Whiplash. Could have been worse.

01:02:39.468 --> 01:02:41.060
She was lucky.

01:02:41.085 --> 01:02:43.443
This is Tony, my sponsor.

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:45.468
From the meeting?

01:02:45.975 --> 01:02:48.175
Can you give us a minute, love?

01:02:48.468 --> 01:02:49.468
Sure.

01:02:51.178 --> 01:02:53.178
I'll be out in the corridor.

01:02:53.866 --> 01:02:55.486
I'm sorry.

01:02:56.194 --> 01:02:57.594
It's fine.

01:02:58.468 --> 01:03:00.168
It's what I'm here for.

01:03:11.468 --> 01:03:14.468
Whatever possessed you to get into a car?

01:03:16.468 --> 01:03:18.668
I went out looking for Jess.

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.568
We'd had a bust up.

01:03:23.368 --> 01:03:25.467
About that lad selling her drugs.

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:28.508
Well, we can talk to her, if you like?

01:03:29.508 --> 01:03:32.148
I don't want her to see me like this.

01:03:35.508 --> 01:03:40.467
Oh, er, we've arrested
Kathy Bennions' daughter

01:03:40.468 --> 01:03:42.714
in connection with your husband's murder.

01:03:43.356 --> 01:03:44.744
Her daughter?

01:03:44.769 --> 01:03:46.058
Hmm.

01:03:46.159 --> 01:03:48.468
Did you know she was
Leon Wilson's partner?

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.120
Like I said... I barely knew him.

01:03:57.057 --> 01:03:59.217
It was my fault.

01:04:02.468 --> 01:04:04.968
I wanted him home for dinner
that night

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:08.488
to sort things out with Jess.

01:04:09.468 --> 01:04:12.468
I wanted us to talk, as a family.

01:04:13.468 --> 01:04:16.468
"For once in your life, don't be late."

01:04:19.468 --> 01:04:22.468
That was the last thing I said to him.

01:04:32.706 --> 01:04:34.507
They're discharging her
this afternoon.

01:04:34.508 --> 01:04:37.467
Oh, well, that's something, I suppose.

01:04:37.468 --> 01:04:39.942
Tony, isn't it?

01:04:39.966 --> 01:04:41.143
How's she doing?

01:04:41.221 --> 01:04:43.467
Ah, she'll be fine once she's sobered up.

01:04:43.468 --> 01:04:45.467
I've been there myself.

01:04:45.468 --> 01:04:48.987
Er... she's had a run-in
with her daughter.

01:04:48.988 --> 01:04:50.667
Doesn't want to see her.

01:04:50.668 --> 01:04:52.667
I'll see if I can talk her round.

01:04:52.668 --> 01:04:56.308
- Make sure she's looked after.
- Thanks, love.

01:05:15.308 --> 01:05:18.780
Tendon injury.
Picked it up in her last ever race.

01:05:20.468 --> 01:05:23.467
- What's his name?
- Lucky Lass.

01:05:23.468 --> 01:05:25.827
Guess her luck ran out today, though.

01:05:25.828 --> 01:05:28.220
Is there something I can help you with?

01:05:28.221 --> 01:05:30.467
Um, aye. Um...

01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:34.467
25 years, you said you'd been
working for Alun Wilmott,

01:05:34.468 --> 01:05:36.467
so you must know him as well as anyone.

01:05:36.468 --> 01:05:38.367
Well enough.

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:40.827
Did he ever mention crossing someone?

01:05:40.828 --> 01:05:43.468
There were always plenty of characters.

01:05:44.988 --> 01:05:46.467
What about this fella?

01:05:46.468 --> 01:05:48.467
Oh aye, I know him.

01:05:48.468 --> 01:05:50.107
Leon Wilson.

01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:51.838
Bit of a gambling habit.

01:05:51.839 --> 01:05:56.267
Now, we think, possibly, he had
something to do with that break-in.

01:05:56.268 --> 01:05:58.467
Well, you're not likely to find him
down here anymore.

01:05:58.468 --> 01:06:00.276
He's been barred from the stadium.

01:06:00.301 --> 01:06:02.075
Aye. On whose say so?

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:05.420
- Aye. You need to talk to security.
- And that'd be Ciaran Duggan?

01:06:05.468 --> 01:06:08.147
Ciaran and Alun gan way back.

01:06:08.148 --> 01:06:10.668
They grew up together in Backworth.

01:06:14.468 --> 01:06:17.467
You also said you thought Alun changed

01:06:17.468 --> 01:06:19.467
the weeks leading up to his death.

01:06:19.468 --> 01:06:21.189
What did you mean by that?

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:23.467
He was worried about losing the business.

01:06:23.468 --> 01:06:25.467
Some sort of takeover bid.

01:06:25.468 --> 01:06:27.467
Do you know the details?

01:06:27.468 --> 01:06:29.467
He tell'd us not to worry.

01:06:29.468 --> 01:06:32.468
Said, you know, he'd got things covered.

01:06:38.268 --> 01:06:39.468
What you looking at?

01:06:39.469 --> 01:06:41.467
She's looking forward to retirement.

01:06:41.468 --> 01:06:44.468
She's earned that, right enough.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.468
Right, thanks.

01:06:49.016 --> 01:06:51.367
If Alun Wilmott was facing
a corporate takeover,

01:06:51.368 --> 01:06:53.467
he's not the kind of bloke
who'd take it lying down.

01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:55.968
You're right, the vultures were circling.

01:06:55.969 --> 01:06:58.507
And I want to know what
his trusted friend and shareholder

01:06:58.508 --> 01:07:00.467
has to say for himself.

01:07:00.468 --> 01:07:02.859
Those shares you bought
in the dog track...

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.242
Ah, what about them?

01:07:04.243 --> 01:07:06.467
Well, the site must be worth
a bit these days,

01:07:06.468 --> 01:07:09.031
all this urban regeneration.

01:07:09.032 --> 01:07:11.467
Alun would never have sold it.
Sentimental value.

01:07:11.468 --> 01:07:14.667
Well, maybe that's why you wanted
to force him out.

01:07:14.668 --> 01:07:17.467
That takeover bid that's been brewing?

01:07:17.468 --> 01:07:20.467
- I had nothing to do with that.
- You knew of it, then.

01:07:20.468 --> 01:07:22.467
Ah, now, now, see.

01:07:22.468 --> 01:07:25.147
That's the thing about reward money.

01:07:25.148 --> 01:07:27.668
It often smacks of a guilty conscience.

01:07:30.668 --> 01:07:34.467
Orla Cossdale approached us
with a business proposal.

01:07:34.468 --> 01:07:38.307
She was considering a bid
from some Chinese investors.

01:07:38.308 --> 01:07:41.195
They'd shown an interest
in redeveloping the stadium.

01:07:41.196 --> 01:07:43.467
An injection of cash
would've turned the company around.

01:07:43.468 --> 01:07:47.047
Oh, aye, not to mention
a tidy packet for yourself,

01:07:47.048 --> 01:07:48.467
once Wilmott
was out of the picture.

01:07:48.468 --> 01:07:50.467
It wasn't personal.

01:07:50.468 --> 01:07:52.667
No, selling out a mate for a profit?

01:07:52.668 --> 01:07:54.868
It was me that tipped him off!

01:07:55.468 --> 01:07:57.768
Told him what was going down.

01:07:58.468 --> 01:08:00.467
That company was his life.

01:08:00.468 --> 01:08:02.468
I wasn't about to ruin him.

01:08:06.468 --> 01:08:09.507
Orla Cossdale's
planning a boardroom coup,

01:08:09.508 --> 01:08:12.062
and now we know Wilmott was onto her.

01:08:12.063 --> 01:08:14.307
Hardly gives her motive
for wanting him dead.

01:08:14.308 --> 01:08:17.466
Doesn't it?
Her days would've been numbered.

01:08:17.468 --> 01:08:19.187
She'd have lost everything.

01:08:19.188 --> 01:08:22.468
That makes her a suspect
in anybody's book.

01:08:24.508 --> 01:08:27.466
Ma'am, we've had an update
from forensics.

01:08:27.468 --> 01:08:29.987
They didn't find any gunshot residue
on the gloves

01:08:29.988 --> 01:08:32.466
that Leon Wilson was wearing,
rules him out as our shooter.

01:08:32.468 --> 01:08:36.466
So the sooner we find him,
the sooner we'll know who was!

01:08:36.468 --> 01:08:39.466
Ma'am, I signed up to that gambling blog.

01:08:39.468 --> 01:08:41.367
The Toon Tipster.

01:08:41.468 --> 01:08:45.466
Well, I'm pleased
you found the time, Kenny!

01:08:45.468 --> 01:08:47.466
Got any hot tips for us?

01:08:47.468 --> 01:08:51.367
Well, to gain access to any picks,
the punter has to sign up

01:08:51.368 --> 01:08:53.367
to an affiliated bookmakers.

01:08:53.368 --> 01:08:55.466
The bookies in question,
OnTrack.

01:08:55.468 --> 01:08:58.850
Well, that's a conflict of interest.

01:08:58.852 --> 01:09:01.466
The tipster builds up
a following on social media.

01:09:01.468 --> 01:09:04.466
The punters get some money back,
while they're building up a pot.

01:09:04.468 --> 01:09:08.466
Then, they bet big
on a dead cert from the tipster.

01:09:08.468 --> 01:09:10.466
That loses, bookies clean up.

01:09:10.468 --> 01:09:12.466
The whole thing's a scam.

01:09:12.468 --> 01:09:15.640
And Gareth Wyatt's up to his eyes in it.

01:09:16.703 --> 01:09:19.187
It was one of Orla's
hush-hush initiatives.

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:21.466
A way of attracting
more attention to OnTrack.

01:09:21.468 --> 01:09:23.466
Yes, so, what's in it for you?

01:09:23.468 --> 01:09:25.031
10% of every punter's losses.

01:09:25.032 --> 01:09:26.975
Well, rent on this place
must have cost a bit.

01:09:26.977 --> 01:09:30.466
Look I don't give a stuff
about your little scam, love.

01:09:30.468 --> 01:09:34.466
But a fella called Leon Wilson
was one of those targeted.

01:09:34.468 --> 01:09:36.466
He was a name that Orla
gave to me, that's all.

01:09:36.468 --> 01:09:40.100
Yeah, well, he's now a suspect
in Alun Wilmott's murder enquiry.

01:09:40.102 --> 01:09:41.466
That's nothing to do with me.

01:09:41.468 --> 01:09:44.147
No? Well, you can explain yourself
to the Gambling Commission.

01:09:44.148 --> 01:09:45.466
We're obliged to report it.

01:09:45.468 --> 01:09:47.466
There's no need for that.

01:09:47.468 --> 01:09:51.307
You must have known Orla Cossdale
was planning a takeover bid,

01:09:51.308 --> 01:09:53.466
seeing as the pair of you
were thick as thieves.

01:09:53.468 --> 01:09:54.820
Which takeover bid was this?

01:09:54.821 --> 01:09:56.953
Oh, don't give me that, love.

01:09:56.954 --> 01:09:59.467
You had access to the database.

01:09:59.468 --> 01:10:00.765
Personal emails.

01:10:00.766 --> 01:10:03.468
And don't tell me
you didn't hack into them.

01:10:05.468 --> 01:10:07.548
I might have read something.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:09.768
A Chinese conglomerate.

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.467
Macau Sun Casino.

01:10:12.468 --> 01:10:14.467
Orla had been sounding out shareholders.

01:10:14.468 --> 01:10:15.468
Why?

01:10:16.468 --> 01:10:19.467
To call for a vote of no confidence
at the next general meeting.

01:10:19.468 --> 01:10:22.468
To oust Alun Wilmott as CEO.

01:10:23.477 --> 01:10:26.467
Now, I'm guessing this meeting
was cancelled?

01:10:26.468 --> 01:10:28.507
Orla rescheduled it for this afternoon.

01:10:28.508 --> 01:10:30.468
The memorial benefit,
over at the stadium.

01:11:03.953 --> 01:11:05.413
We're about to
go into a meeting.

01:11:05.438 --> 01:11:08.438
Oh, no, that's gonna have to wait, love.

01:11:08.468 --> 01:11:13.467
Now, we can talk here, if you like,
in front of your foreign investors,

01:11:13.468 --> 01:11:16.468
or you can talk to us down
at the station.

01:11:19.308 --> 01:11:20.768
Excuse me.

01:11:31.468 --> 01:11:33.325
Leon Wilson.

01:11:33.926 --> 01:11:35.768
That name ring a bell?

01:11:37.268 --> 01:11:38.468
Can't say I know him.

01:11:38.469 --> 01:11:40.042
Ah, that won't wash, love.

01:11:40.043 --> 01:11:42.128
That's Ronnie Bennions' partner.

01:11:42.129 --> 01:11:44.128
A regular down at the dog track.

01:11:44.129 --> 01:11:45.987
Currently missing.

01:11:45.988 --> 01:11:48.467
And I think you paid him to disappear.

01:11:48.468 --> 01:11:50.361
Now, why would I want to do that?

01:11:50.362 --> 01:11:54.567
Well, maybe he could tie you
to Alun Wilmott's murder.

01:11:54.568 --> 01:11:56.067
Hmm?

01:11:56.468 --> 01:11:58.988
That takeover bid you'd been planning.

01:12:01.295 --> 01:12:04.295
I already had the numbers.
And I didn't need him dead.

01:12:04.368 --> 01:12:06.467
Are you sure about that, love?

01:12:06.468 --> 01:12:11.467
Because... Royce Hobson
had already changed his mind.

01:12:11.468 --> 01:12:14.467
Hmm. Crisis of conscience.

01:12:14.468 --> 01:12:16.267
Alun was finished as CEO.

01:12:16.268 --> 01:12:17.987
And you thought
you could do a better job?

01:12:17.988 --> 01:12:20.467
He could have stood down
with his dignity intact.

01:12:20.468 --> 01:12:23.468
You knew he was onto you!

01:12:24.468 --> 01:12:27.968
You have got nothing
to tie me to any of this.

01:12:29.059 --> 01:12:30.259
What?

01:12:30.468 --> 01:12:32.668
Sorry, ma'am. A word.

01:12:33.468 --> 01:12:36.188
I wouldn't be too sure about that, love.

01:12:41.468 --> 01:12:43.467
This'd better be important,
Kenny.

01:12:43.468 --> 01:12:45.467
We've found Leon Wilson,
ma'am.

01:12:45.468 --> 01:12:48.507
Oh, it's about bloody time!

01:12:48.508 --> 01:12:51.468
His body was pulled out of the river
this morning.

01:13:06.468 --> 01:13:08.467
Is it definitely him?

01:13:08.468 --> 01:13:10.827
- Yep, we found ID in his wallet.
- Right.

01:13:10.828 --> 01:13:12.467
Who called it in?

01:13:12.468 --> 01:13:14.467
One of the dockers.
Saw the body in the water.

01:13:14.468 --> 01:13:18.104
Well, I want 'em all questioned.
And CCTV.

01:13:18.105 --> 01:13:20.467
And find out who was working
the evening shift.

01:13:20.468 --> 01:13:22.467
Keeping you busy, Malcolm?

01:13:22.468 --> 01:13:25.206
Blunt injury trauma to the head.

01:13:25.207 --> 01:13:28.468
The body is still swollen.
You're lucky he didn't sink.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:32.467
Could he have gone in somewhere else
and floated in on the current?

01:13:32.468 --> 01:13:34.567
No, we found blood
over on the quayside.

01:13:34.568 --> 01:13:36.608
He was definitely murdered here.

01:13:38.468 --> 01:13:41.467
Middle of the night,
the place would've been deserted.

01:13:41.468 --> 01:13:45.468
Someone lured him down here,
with every intention of killing him.

01:13:54.468 --> 01:13:58.307
Now, I think someone
wanted to silence him.

01:13:58.308 --> 01:14:01.467
Someone connected to that break-in.

01:14:01.468 --> 01:14:03.567
The best chance for you
and that lad of yours

01:14:03.568 --> 01:14:05.680
is for you to cooperate with us.

01:14:07.311 --> 01:14:09.711
They were only supposed
to rob the place.

01:14:11.468 --> 01:14:13.987
Wilmott came home early,
caught them in the house.

01:14:13.988 --> 01:14:15.899
Leon didn't even know
the other fella had a gun.

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:18.467
Ah, I'm gonna need a name, love.

01:14:18.468 --> 01:14:20.307
I swear he didn't tell us.

01:14:20.308 --> 01:14:22.467
Just some fella he got talking to.

01:14:22.468 --> 01:14:24.467
What, down at the dog track?

01:14:24.468 --> 01:14:26.068
No, I think

01:14:26.468 --> 01:14:28.340
it was one of the clubs.

01:14:30.366 --> 01:14:34.106
He knew Leon had worked at the Wilmotts.

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:35.766
Knew the layout of the house.

01:14:35.767 --> 01:14:37.467
How well did he know him?

01:14:37.468 --> 01:14:39.549
He'd seen him around. I...

01:14:40.468 --> 01:14:42.467
he might've worked on the doors there.

01:14:42.468 --> 01:14:43.704
Which club was this?

01:14:43.705 --> 01:14:45.467
Could've been anywhere in Jarrow.

01:14:45.468 --> 01:14:48.467
All depended on which bookies
he'd spent the afternoon in.

01:14:48.468 --> 01:14:52.468
Did he ever cross paths
with Orla Cossdale?

01:14:53.468 --> 01:14:55.467
That feud with OnTrack?

01:14:55.468 --> 01:14:57.467
Only at the trial.

01:14:57.468 --> 01:14:59.768
What, your compensation claim?

01:14:59.903 --> 01:15:01.467
Orla offered Leon a deal.

01:15:01.468 --> 01:15:05.467
She said she'd pay off his debts,
provided we agreed to drop the case.

01:15:05.468 --> 01:15:07.467
I told her where to stick her offer.

01:15:07.468 --> 01:15:08.923
And how'd she take that?

01:15:08.924 --> 01:15:12.468
She said we'd be sorry
we ever crossed her.

01:15:17.988 --> 01:15:22.467
Leon Wilson met his accomplice
in a boozer in Jarrow.

01:15:22.468 --> 01:15:23.987
Now, he could've been a doorman.

01:15:23.988 --> 01:15:26.667
Now, I want door-to-door enquiries.

01:15:26.668 --> 01:15:29.467
Bars, clubs,
anywhere with a licence.

01:15:29.468 --> 01:15:31.467
That's gonna take a while.

01:15:31.468 --> 01:15:33.120
So, why you still here?

01:15:34.148 --> 01:15:38.467
Er, ma'am, I got some intel
back from Cyber Crime.

01:15:38.468 --> 01:15:42.467
Um, a recent payment was made
by OnTrack, 7.6 Bitcoin.

01:15:42.468 --> 01:15:44.219
How much was that in real money?

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:45.820
About £50,000.

01:15:46.668 --> 01:15:48.987
That's our ransom demand!

01:15:48.988 --> 01:15:50.467
Looks like we've
hit a wall though.

01:15:50.468 --> 01:15:52.468
The payment was sent to
a public IP address.

01:15:53.668 --> 01:15:56.468
An internet cafe in Ouseburn.

01:16:08.468 --> 01:16:10.987
Sorry to have kept you, love,

01:16:10.988 --> 01:16:14.467
only we've just pulled Leon Wilson's
body out of the river.

01:16:14.468 --> 01:16:17.827
So we're now looking at a double murder.

01:16:17.828 --> 01:16:20.467
Silenced before he could
implicate anyone.

01:16:20.468 --> 01:16:23.467
So, did one of the bookies
tip you off, love?

01:16:23.468 --> 01:16:26.467
Are you seriously suggesting
I had him killed too?

01:16:26.468 --> 01:16:29.467
Only when we broke the news
to Ronnie Bennions,

01:16:29.468 --> 01:16:33.147
she told us you offered
to write off Leon's debts.

01:16:33.148 --> 01:16:35.987
I advised them to drop the case,
that's all.

01:16:35.988 --> 01:16:38.782
Well, it sounded like a threat to me.

01:16:38.783 --> 01:16:41.467
I was the one that was keeping
that company afloat.

01:16:41.468 --> 01:16:43.149
It was only that
Alun couldn't see it.

01:16:43.150 --> 01:16:46.467
Nah, he saw right through you, love!
Saw you for what you really are.

01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:49.055
If I'd been looking for someone
to kill Alun Wilmott,

01:16:49.056 --> 01:16:51.032
he's the last person
I'd have trusted.

01:16:51.033 --> 01:16:53.860
Leon Wilson was a business opportunity.

01:16:53.861 --> 01:16:56.173
A gullible punter who made us some money.

01:16:56.174 --> 01:16:59.251
Well, now he's dead too, love,

01:16:59.252 --> 01:17:02.467
and you're as much to blame as anyone.

01:17:02.468 --> 01:17:04.467
I've got nothing to do with any of this.

01:17:04.468 --> 01:17:06.468
So, unless you're gonna charge
me with something

01:17:07.828 --> 01:17:09.828
there's a shareholders' meeting
I'm missing.

01:17:19.828 --> 01:17:22.467
Won't sit too well with
those shareholders, will it,

01:17:22.468 --> 01:17:25.507
when they find out that you paid off
that ransom demand,

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:27.707
misappropriating company funds?

01:17:29.166 --> 01:17:33.988
Ah, we established the identity
of that cyber extortionist.

01:17:35.225 --> 01:17:37.225
Seems it was an inside job.

01:17:40.468 --> 01:17:44.468
You've been played, love,
by the Toon Tipster.

01:17:52.194 --> 01:17:56.034
Ma'am, forensics have just released
Leon Wilson's personal effects.

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:05.100
Branhill Road Social Club.

01:18:08.181 --> 01:18:09.741
Who works the doors there?

01:18:09.828 --> 01:18:11.840
That'll be Duggan Security,
ma'am.

01:18:15.308 --> 01:18:17.148
You're a diamond, Kenny!

01:18:25.468 --> 01:18:27.327
Leon Wilson.

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:30.080
You must have heard we found his body.

01:18:30.105 --> 01:18:31.505
I heard.

01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:35.147
Now, I think he was killed to silence him

01:18:35.148 --> 01:18:38.143
by the same person
who killed Alun Wilmott.

01:18:38.144 --> 01:18:40.160
You still think it might be me?

01:18:41.374 --> 01:18:43.374
I heard the pair of you
grew up together.

01:18:43.399 --> 01:18:45.079
He never forgot
where he came from.

01:18:45.148 --> 01:18:47.467
Money might've changed him,
but he was still one of us.

01:18:47.468 --> 01:18:49.367
Now, listen...

01:18:49.468 --> 01:18:54.291
Leon Wilson's accomplice worked at
Branhill Road Social Club.

01:18:54.292 --> 01:18:56.467
And if I'm not mistaken,
that's one of your gigs.

01:18:56.468 --> 01:18:58.467
Nah. Nah,
it weren't one of my boys.

01:18:58.468 --> 01:19:00.830
Are you sure about that, love?

01:19:00.831 --> 01:19:02.307
I know 'em all too well.

01:19:02.308 --> 01:19:07.189
But you must've bumped heads with
plenty of hard cases in your time.

01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:09.827
What about a former employee?

01:19:09.828 --> 01:19:11.468
Think!

01:19:11.764 --> 01:19:13.424
Branhill Road.

01:19:18.828 --> 01:19:21.467
Any number of faces in there.

01:19:21.468 --> 01:19:23.820
You want to pull 'em all in, be my guest.

01:19:42.988 --> 01:19:44.467
Tony Hinshaw.

01:19:44.468 --> 01:19:47.468
We only hired him for a few months.
Bit of a drink problem.

01:19:53.988 --> 01:19:56.158
No sign of Gareth Wyatt.
Looks like he's done a runner.

01:19:56.159 --> 01:19:57.467
<i>Never mind him!</i>

01:19:57.468 --> 01:20:00.018
I think I know
who killed Alun Wilmott.

01:20:00.019 --> 01:20:01.467
Tony Hinshaw,

01:20:01.491 --> 01:20:03.467
Louise Wilmott's sponsor.

01:20:03.468 --> 01:20:06.467
He's got previous.
Two DUIs and assault.

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:08.467
Well, make sure Louise is all right.

01:20:08.468 --> 01:20:10.467
Get someone over to
her mam's house to check.

01:20:10.468 --> 01:20:11.468
We've got an address.

01:20:11.469 --> 01:20:13.987
Cullyston Burn. It's boat on the river.

01:20:13.988 --> 01:20:17.307
Now, I'm already over in Towden,
so I'll see you there.

01:20:17.308 --> 01:20:18.668
Boss, wait!

01:21:16.668 --> 01:21:18.668
Tony's boat, isn't it?

01:21:19.468 --> 01:21:21.367
Tony Hinshaw.

01:21:21.468 --> 01:21:24.180
He's gone to the garage. Cigarettes.

01:21:26.468 --> 01:21:29.468
Well, it's time for a quick chat,
then. Just the two of us.

01:21:30.468 --> 01:21:31.968
OK if I come up?

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:36.909
This is DS Healey
on route to Cullyston Burn.

01:21:36.934 --> 01:21:39.454
Solo officer dealing with a suspect
in connection with a murder.

01:21:39.479 --> 01:21:43.220
Request armed response attend,
with additional units as back-up.

01:21:47.178 --> 01:21:51.178
Now, Jess'll be worried
if you've not been home yet.

01:21:51.203 --> 01:21:53.203
She's better off without me.

01:21:53.228 --> 01:21:54.920
I doubt that, love.

01:21:55.468 --> 01:21:57.827
She's only just lost her dad.

01:21:57.828 --> 01:22:00.827
I mean how's the poor lass
gonna feel, eh,

01:22:00.828 --> 01:22:03.468
when she hears what her mam has done?

01:22:09.468 --> 01:22:12.200
Your husband got it right, didn't he,

01:22:12.225 --> 01:22:14.365
when he suspected
you were playing away?

01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:17.710
Is that when you and Tony
came up with the plan?

01:22:17.828 --> 01:22:20.467
Hey, you played your part well enough.

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:22.667
Made sure those alarms
were turned off.

01:22:22.668 --> 01:22:25.280
Even had your daughter there
as a witness.

01:22:25.899 --> 01:22:27.467
Alun would never
have let me go.

01:22:27.468 --> 01:22:29.467
That must've taken some planning.

01:22:29.468 --> 01:22:32.660
All those afternoon meetings
at the church hall.

01:22:34.204 --> 01:22:37.454
I tried to stop him.
I told him I'd changed my mind.

01:22:37.468 --> 01:22:40.468
He could have
taken the money and walked away.

01:22:41.668 --> 01:22:44.147
You might have wanted
to change your mind, love,

01:22:44.148 --> 01:22:47.507
but you stood there in that house
and watched it all play out.

01:22:47.508 --> 01:22:50.307
And after the job was done,
you lied to us,

01:22:50.308 --> 01:22:52.168
you lied to your daughter.

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:55.827
And then you just carried on
covering your tracks.

01:22:55.828 --> 01:22:57.868
I think we're done talking.

01:23:02.468 --> 01:23:04.987
She was on her way to warn you,
wasn't she,

01:23:04.988 --> 01:23:06.467
when she crashed her car?

01:23:06.468 --> 01:23:09.367
And you went to the hospital
'cause you were afraid

01:23:09.368 --> 01:23:11.467
the booze might've
loosened her tongue.

01:23:11.468 --> 01:23:15.147
I told you, didn't I?
I said I had everything covered.

01:23:15.148 --> 01:23:18.468
Was that before or after
you killed Leon Wilson?

01:23:19.655 --> 01:23:20.900
Tony?

01:23:22.268 --> 01:23:24.467
What else was it
she offered you, love?

01:23:24.468 --> 01:23:26.467
Widow's insurance money?

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:28.488
I didn't do it for the money!

01:23:30.468 --> 01:23:31.967
I love her!

01:23:33.331 --> 01:23:35.540
More than her husband ever did.

01:23:40.441 --> 01:23:42.241
Eyes on the suspect.

01:23:47.468 --> 01:23:49.988
What the hell is she doing?

01:23:52.368 --> 01:23:54.467
Put the gun down, love.

01:23:54.468 --> 01:23:56.567
Or are you planning on
killing me, too?

01:23:56.568 --> 01:23:58.467
Don't think I wouldn't.

01:23:58.468 --> 01:24:02.467
What... two dead souls
not enough for you?

01:24:02.468 --> 01:24:04.507
- Tony...
- Stay where you are, love!

01:24:04.508 --> 01:24:07.467
- Tell them to hold back.
- Stand down.

01:24:07.468 --> 01:24:08.668
Tony...

01:24:10.374 --> 01:24:11.674
it's finished.

01:24:11.717 --> 01:24:13.117
Don't, love.

01:24:16.213 --> 01:24:18.667
I'll shoot her too! Do you hear me?

01:24:18.668 --> 01:24:20.307
All right. OK.

01:24:20.308 --> 01:24:22.467
Tony, put it down, love.

01:24:22.468 --> 01:24:26.467
There's a team of armed officers,
and if they give the order to fire,

01:24:26.468 --> 01:24:30.468
you know as well as I do,
they're not gonna be aiming at me.

01:24:32.508 --> 01:24:35.467
Look, after everything you've done,

01:24:35.468 --> 01:24:37.468
if you harm her...

01:24:39.256 --> 01:24:41.856
you'd never be able
to live with yourself.

01:24:42.468 --> 01:24:45.468
Put the gun down, love.

01:24:47.256 --> 01:24:49.256
I'm so sorry.

01:24:49.281 --> 01:24:50.481
I'm sorry.

01:24:52.828 --> 01:24:55.467
Armed police! Show me your hands!

01:25:17.468 --> 01:25:20.468
That's it, keep going. Keep moving.

01:26:06.468 --> 01:26:08.308
I'll be outside.

01:26:27.468 --> 01:26:29.740
I hope they lock you up for life.

01:27:01.468 --> 01:27:03.768
Get the measure of him, did they?

01:27:05.468 --> 01:27:08.140
"Titan of industry".

01:27:08.165 --> 01:27:11.780
All the money in the world's
not gonna bring him back, is it?

01:27:13.468 --> 01:27:16.467
Ma'am, thought you might need
a wee drink.

01:27:16.468 --> 01:27:18.700
Eh, thanks, Kenny.

01:27:20.155 --> 01:27:24.155
I tell you what, you keep that cold
for us, 'cause, er...

01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:26.180
I've just got to nip out.

01:27:35.468 --> 01:27:36.914
Where's she off to?

01:27:36.915 --> 01:27:39.467
All right, place your bets.

01:27:39.468 --> 01:27:41.147
Hairdresser's, what are the odds?

01:27:41.148 --> 01:27:43.008
1,000 to one.

01:27:43.009 --> 01:27:45.568
She probably cuts her hair herself.

01:27:47.468 --> 01:27:50.040
£20 says she's halfway home already.

01:27:50.508 --> 01:27:52.568
The day she's had.

01:28:11.468 --> 01:28:13.668
Well, come on, if you're coming.

01:28:17.468 --> 01:28:19.548
Someone I want you to meet.

01:28:24.468 --> 01:28:26.668
Well, here you are, Adam.

01:28:28.006 --> 01:28:30.467
- She's all yours.
- What's his name?

01:28:30.468 --> 01:28:33.467
Well, she answers to the name of Lucky,

01:28:33.468 --> 01:28:36.468
so I should stick with that,
all right?

01:28:38.668 --> 01:28:40.468
Bye-bye, Lucky.
