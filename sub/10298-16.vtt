01:34.434 --> 01:36.834
That's what I hate about
this time of year.

01:36.834 --> 01:39.167
Nothing on but reruns.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.734
Oh, hi,
honey.

01:50.334 --> 01:51.434
Ow!

01:51.434 --> 01:53.701
What is it, Peg,
couch sores?

01:56.434 --> 01:58.400
No, it's TV thumb.

02:00.467 --> 02:03.667
But, I'm a housewife.
It goes with the territory.

02:04.934 --> 02:06.400
So how was
your day?

02:06.400 --> 02:07.567
Peg, it was
the worst day--

02:07.567 --> 02:10.032
That's nice, dear.

02:10.032 --> 02:11.467
I want a vacation.

02:11.467 --> 02:13.133
I need to do
something different.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.234
No problem.

02:14.234 --> 02:15.734
Next week when you're
watching TV,

02:15.734 --> 02:17.334
try watching with
your mouth closed.

02:19.501 --> 02:21.133
I'm serious, Al.

02:21.133 --> 02:23.501
They always give you a vacation.

02:23.501 --> 02:24.901
Remember last April?

02:24.901 --> 02:28.133
That was my hernia
operation, Peg.

02:28.133 --> 02:30.467
And then what about
Christmas day?

02:30.467 --> 02:31.601
You remember?

02:31.601 --> 02:33.300
You didn't have to
go in until 2.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.267
Yeah, what a day.

02:35.267 --> 02:37.334
Between stepping over
your egg-nogged body

02:37.334 --> 02:38.901
and thawing out my underwear

02:38.901 --> 02:42.467
you so thoughtfully left
on the clothesline outside...

02:42.467 --> 02:44.701
I did have about
five seconds of fun.

02:44.701 --> 02:46.501
It was watching
all those stars

02:46.501 --> 02:49.367
when I stepped on the shovel
Bud left buried in the snow.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.801
Why is it that whenever
I want something,

02:58.801 --> 03:01.267
all you can talk about
is yourself?

03:01.267 --> 03:05.267
It's always my back,
my hernia, my 'roids.

03:08.801 --> 03:11.734
Don't you see the rut
our lives have become?

03:11.734 --> 03:13.534
I need a vacation.

03:13.534 --> 03:16.868
Peg, if you want to
visit someplace new,
try the kitchen.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.334
And while you're
out there,

03:23.334 --> 03:25.634
don't forgot to take
a picture by the refrigerator.

03:25.634 --> 03:27.701
You know,
Old Empty.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.501
God, I hate men!

03:35.868 --> 03:37.734
I thought you were
man's best friend.

03:45.167 --> 03:47.968
Oh, that's a dog,
not a chicken.
Sorry, Marcie.

03:50.434 --> 03:52.100
Oh, shut up, you hamhock.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.334
Peggy, read this note
from Steve.

03:55.334 --> 03:58.234
It was waiting
on my pillow when
I came home from work.

03:58.234 --> 03:59.234
"Dear Marcie--"

03:59.234 --> 04:02.300
"Dear Marcie"
my sweet patootie!

04:02.300 --> 04:04.334
The geek is
leaving me!

04:04.334 --> 04:07.868
Oh, he doesn't mean that.
He loves you.

04:07.868 --> 04:09.200
I guess
you're right.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.167
He probably meant to
say that when
he wrote this:

04:12.167 --> 04:15.033
"Frankly, I'm sick
of you. You disgust me.

04:16.767 --> 04:21.733
"I had a full head
of hair when
I met you...

04:21.733 --> 04:26.467
and I'm sure my nose grew
during our marriage."

04:26.467 --> 04:30.534
He says he's going
to Yosemite to be
a park ranger.

04:30.534 --> 04:32.501
He's rejected
materialism

04:32.501 --> 04:36.200
and all the evils
brought about
by the quest for money.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.400
Oh. And he's suing me
for alimony.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.567
[LAUGHING]

04:43.601 --> 04:46.100
Be strong, Marce.
You don't need a man.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.267
I mean, what are they
good for?

04:48.267 --> 04:49.667
They sit there
like a lump.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.567
They pick, they burp,
they let one fly.

04:57.534 --> 05:00.868
And then they smile
like they just won
the Nobel prize.

05:04.167 --> 05:05.200
Oh.

05:08.267 --> 05:10.467
And then once a month,
they roll over on you

05:10.467 --> 05:11.734
on their way
to the bathroom,

05:11.734 --> 05:13.934
and they call that
loving.

05:15.667 --> 05:18.434
Not that you're
not the best, baby.

05:22.367 --> 05:24.767
You should feel lucky
Steve left you.

05:24.767 --> 05:27.334
This is the dawn
of a new age
for you, Marce.

05:27.334 --> 05:30.501
You know, Peggy.
You're right.

05:30.501 --> 05:32.534
I can do better
than Steve.

05:32.534 --> 05:33.834
I have my health.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.167
BOTH:
Right.

05:37.167 --> 05:39.167
I have my youth.

05:39.167 --> 05:40.667
Right.
Yup.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.300
I've got
my looks.

05:45.033 --> 05:47.934
Thank God I have you
for a support group.

05:47.934 --> 05:49.968
Well, it's Steve's loss.

05:49.968 --> 05:52.868
If he can't handle a strong,
intelligent woman,

05:52.868 --> 05:54.467
then tough noogies on him.

05:55.501 --> 05:56.534
That's right,
Marce.

05:56.534 --> 05:57.968
He'll come crawling
back to you.

05:57.968 --> 05:59.868
He will. I think this
is just gonna blow over.

05:59.868 --> 06:00.868
You'll be just fine.

06:00.868 --> 06:02.234
Go ahead.
Go home.

06:02.234 --> 06:03.367
Right.

06:04.634 --> 06:06.133
I'm gonna go home...

06:06.133 --> 06:08.267
and cut the crotches
out of all of his pants.

06:10.901 --> 06:12.834
And drag his ties
through dog poo.

06:14.701 --> 06:18.033
As far as I'm concerned,
it's just one less egg to fry.

06:20.567 --> 06:22.334
[DOORBELL RINGS]

06:25.667 --> 06:26.801
I don't want
to be alone.

06:26.801 --> 06:28.601
I'm afraid, I'm weak
and helpless.

06:28.601 --> 06:31.300
There, there.
There, there.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.267
Now...peel her off me,
will you?

06:35.167 --> 06:39.200
Now, Marcie. It's
gonna be all right.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.634

stay here with us.

No.

06:42.334 --> 06:43.667

Oh,
of course not.

off Buck's blanket.

Hi, Kelly.
I...see your butt's moving.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.601
You must be reading.

07:26.834 --> 07:28.734
Gee, Bud, you look
a little bit pale.

07:28.734 --> 07:31.934
It must be your face
trying to peek out
from behind your pimples.

Oh, big news
in the neighborhood.

Mrs. Rhoades like an old shoe.

07:37.567 --> 07:38.901
No kidding?

07:38.901 --> 07:41.167
Yup. He left her
to go be a ranger
in that park?

Yogi Bear lives?

leave a babe like that?

this could be
your big chance.

08:08.467 --> 08:11.567
Well, Mrs. Rhoades
is staying with us tonight.

08:11.567 --> 08:12.834
She's man-less.

08:12.834 --> 08:14.734
And you must have seen
how she looks at you.

08:14.734 --> 08:16.467
Well, sure.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.467
How?

Bud, don't be a cowpie

08:24.801 --> 08:26.400
She's hot for you.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.033
She's reaching
her sexual peak.

You're reaching your sexual
peak, sad as that may be.

08:32.501 --> 08:34.100
I mean, this could be
your big chance.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.801
And what woman
wouldn't want a virgin?

08:35.801 --> 08:36.801
Yeah!

I'll-- I'll lie to her
about that part,
but, uh...

08:48.067 --> 08:49.834
When do you think
I should make my move?

08:49.834 --> 08:52.868
You'll know when
the time is right.

Man! I'm gonna
get me an old woman.

Mr. Rhoades used and left you

09:18.968 --> 09:21.901

in the men's room
at the bus station?

It's as inevitable as
death in Texas.

So, what you've gotta do
is get yourself a new guy.

Oh, no more men for me.

on me, I'll slap him silly.

"Yes, yes," in her eyes.

to be comfortable,

about yourself.
