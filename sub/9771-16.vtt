Come on.
Let's go.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.911
- Why is Pierre Le Mange
under arrest?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.330
- This guy
is not Pierre Le Mange.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.249
- What?
- He's an impostor.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.293
He goes around the country
pretending he's Mr. Le Mange

19:29.376 --> 19:33.630
so he can get free stuff
and special VIP treatment.

19:33.714 --> 19:34.923
- No way.
- For real?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.008
- Yeah.
We've been chasing this guy

19:36.091 --> 19:38.719
ever since
the Burbank tamale festival.

19:38.802 --> 19:39.720
- Oh, my god.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.972
- Burbank has
a tamale festival?

19:42.055 --> 19:43.640
- Put him in the car.

from the car!

19:53.692 --> 20:00.324

20:02.326 --> 20:03.285

20:03.368 --> 20:04.828
This whole rib cook-off
was for nothing.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.622
- No, it wasn't.
- Yeah.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.206
We had some fun, had some ribs,

20:08.290 --> 20:10.834
got to see some cops
tackle some fake dude.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.502
- Yeah.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.589
Right before he picked
<i>our</i> ribs as number one.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.007
- Your ribs don't even come
close to our ribs.

20:17.090 --> 20:19.217
- You don't know about my ribs!
- I know about your ribs!

20:19.301 --> 20:20.135
- My grandma made my ribs!
- All right!

20:20.218 --> 20:22.512
[both shouting]
All right!

20:22.596 --> 20:23.764
All right!

20:23.847 --> 20:24.973
We're all sick and tired

20:25.057 --> 20:26.934
of you two screaming
at each other.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.019
- So from now on,
no more arguing.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.228
- Seriously.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.860
- They're right, you know.

20:36.944 --> 20:37.903
- Yeah.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.405
- So, uh, let's just--

20:42.699 --> 20:44.493
- Oh.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.579
- Beautiful.
- How sweet.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.122
- All right,

20:49.206 --> 20:52.709
