WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:03.916
Previously onMom...Oh, my God, what?

00:03.960 --> 00:05.831
I'm in the middle
of a tennis lesson.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.181
My mom just got arrested,

00:07.224 --> 00:09.052
and I need to borrow
two grand for bail.

00:09.096 --> 00:11.533
God, Christy,
you gambled Adam's money?

00:11.576 --> 00:12.882
I did.

00:12.925 --> 00:13.752
[sighs]

00:13.796 --> 00:15.493
So then I called Jill.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.887
And you gambled
Jill's money, too?

00:17.930 --> 00:21.673
Uh, this past week, I gambled
away $4,000 of my friends' money

00:21.717 --> 00:23.675
and stranded my mom
in a jail cell.

00:23.719 --> 00:26.852
Oh, Jill. I've got some more
of the money that I owe you.

00:26.896 --> 00:28.202
Payment number three.

00:28.245 --> 00:29.203
Thank you, Christy.

00:29.246 --> 00:31.466
Only 37 to go.

00:33.598 --> 00:36.166
Oh, there's a 12:30 matinee
about the aliens who...

00:36.210 --> 00:38.516
No. Ooh, how 'bout
the two women who realize

00:38.560 --> 00:40.736
they're dating
the same man?No.

00:40.779 --> 00:43.217
There's the new Tom...No.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.088
Oh, wait a minute--
Hanks or Cruise?Hanks.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.089
No.Cruise?

00:46.133 --> 00:47.743
No.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.571
How 'bout the one where
the daughter is so desperate

00:49.614 --> 00:51.921
for quiet, she beats her mother
with a law book?

00:51.964 --> 00:53.575
I don't like documentaries.

00:53.618 --> 00:56.578
Come on, we'll argue
about the movie on the way.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.580
Hey, has anyone
kidnapped a member

00:58.623 --> 00:59.972
of Liam Neeson's family lately?

01:00.016 --> 01:03.193
[scoffs] I wish.
Not till Christmas.

01:03.237 --> 01:05.282
Uh, Tammy, what are you doing?

01:05.326 --> 01:07.110
Oh, my ChapStick rolled
under the bookcase,

01:07.154 --> 01:09.243
so I pulled it out
and spotted a stain here.

01:09.286 --> 01:12.333
Full disclosure,
I found a dollar.

01:14.117 --> 01:16.032
Anyway, it looks
like water damage.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.295
Yeah, that's why we keep
the bookcase there.

01:18.339 --> 01:19.731
In fact,
every piece of furniture

01:19.775 --> 01:21.255
in here is hiding something.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.213
You think we wanted
to put a desk over there?

01:23.257 --> 01:25.128
But water damage
could be serious.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.738
I'm sure it is,
but when I paint over it,

01:26.782 --> 01:29.132
it goes away for six months.

01:29.176 --> 01:30.786
Okay, we're going to a movie.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.440
Oh, thanks, I can't come.

01:33.702 --> 01:34.659
Oh, that's too bad.Maybe next time.

01:34.703 --> 01:36.661
All right, have fun.

01:36.705 --> 01:39.099
[knocking]

01:41.449 --> 01:43.059
Do you need to do that?

01:43.103 --> 01:45.061
Sure do.
Checking for water damage.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.019
It's the silent killer.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.456
Not very silent.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.414
Listen, can you hear
the different tones?

01:52.024 --> 01:55.332
All I hear is me flunking out
of law school.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.117
Might be some mold, too.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.770
Could explain your headaches.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.076
I don't have headaches.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.644
Really? So you just make
that face for no reason?

02:02.687 --> 02:05.386
Look, I know
you just want to help out,

02:05.429 --> 02:07.779
and we appreciate it,
but I'm trying to study.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.477
Roger that.
Pursuit of the dream.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.132
Man, this wall's
like cottage cheese.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.176
Whoops.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.395
Oh, my God,

02:14.438 --> 02:15.744
get your hand out of there.

02:15.787 --> 02:18.050
[grunts]
Oh!

02:19.530 --> 02:20.923
Are you sure
you don't have headaches?

02:20.966 --> 02:22.359
'Cause there's that face again.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.711
â™ª

02:46.166 --> 02:47.515
I don't usually like
action movies,

02:47.558 --> 02:48.777
but that was kind of fun.

02:48.820 --> 02:51.258
Eh, they lost me
with the so-called stunts.

02:51.301 --> 02:52.607
[mutters]:
"It was all computer graphics."

02:52.650 --> 02:54.043
It was all
computer graphics.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.523
I mean, in my day,

02:55.566 --> 02:57.351
when you fought on the
wing of a jet fighter,

02:57.394 --> 02:59.396
you really fought on
the wing of a jet fighter.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.528
Did you do that?

03:00.571 --> 03:01.703
Well, not while it was moving.

03:01.746 --> 03:03.139
That'd be too dangerous.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.447
Ooh, that guy's getting
a neck tattoo.

03:06.490 --> 03:09.145
Is it the word "mistake"?

03:09.189 --> 03:13.236
Hey, check it out, Grandma
and Grandpa are getting inked.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.631
Were they talking about us?

03:16.674 --> 03:18.633
Do you see their
grandparents around?

03:18.676 --> 03:20.852
Hey! Hey, we're not that old.

03:20.896 --> 03:23.159
And pull up your pants.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.553
Why don't you just call him
"whippersnapper"?

03:25.596 --> 03:27.903
Screw them. We're still cool.

03:27.946 --> 03:30.688
You know what?
Let's get tattoos.

03:30.732 --> 03:33.343
Why? The mean boys are gone.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.650
Not for them, for us. Come on.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.304
Tell me it's not
on your bucket list.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.828
I-I don't really need a tattoo.
I got ice cream.

03:39.871 --> 03:43.092
Please? His and her tattoos.
It'll be so romantic.

03:43.135 --> 03:44.920
Or we could go home
and make love.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.226
Eh.
[blows raspberry]

03:48.358 --> 03:51.056
And now Tammy's got the
whole wall torn apart.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.321
It's like the world's saddest
home remodeling show.

03:54.364 --> 03:56.932
Ta-da, it's still a dump.

03:56.975 --> 04:00.283
Between us, she scares me.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.024
Really? She loves you.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.852
Aw, she's the best.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.810
[mouths]Anyway,

04:05.854 --> 04:07.638
study here as long as you like.

04:07.682 --> 04:10.250
Thanks. Tammy said it's only
gonna be a couple of days.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.948
Oh, honey, I know
how construction goes.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.950
Whether it's new boobs
or a new bathroom,

04:14.993 --> 04:17.648
it always takes longer and hurts
way more than they tell you.

04:17.692 --> 04:20.303
Well, this is amazing.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.697
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't sit down yet.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.308
The second foot towel
isn't in place. Belinda?

04:25.352 --> 04:27.092
Flying in.

04:27.136 --> 04:29.660
Oh, I-I think I can scrape
by with one foot towel.

04:29.704 --> 04:31.923
One would think.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.142
Anything else, ma'am?

04:33.185 --> 04:34.317
Just the blueberry blend

04:34.361 --> 04:36.058
that I asked for 20 minutes ago.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.629
Isn't she great?

04:41.672 --> 04:44.196
It's like I got Mary Poppins
bringing me smoothies.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.763
You need anything?

04:45.807 --> 04:47.678
No, just some quiet.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.680
Yeah, well, this is a perfect
place to work.

04:49.724 --> 04:52.335
Read a book out here once.

04:52.379 --> 04:55.643
Turns out Rob Lowe
had a hard life.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.079
Oh, my God.

04:57.122 --> 04:59.908
What are these towels
made of, kittens?

04:59.951 --> 05:03.215
Enjoy.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:03.259 --> 05:04.608
I got to go change.

05:04.652 --> 05:07.655
For what?It's 2:00.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.403
[straining]:
I'm so glad we're doing this.

05:16.446 --> 05:19.144
[straining]: Me, too.
This is super fun.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.800
You almost done back there?

05:22.844 --> 05:24.628
No, just finishing
the B in "Bonnie."

05:24.672 --> 05:27.414
Are you kidding?
I need a break.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.416
A-And can I have another juice?

05:29.459 --> 05:32.419
Come on, you big wuss.
I thought you were tough.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.420
This hurts.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.422
Yeah, but it hurts so good.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.641
Okay. All done.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.643
Take a look.

05:39.687 --> 05:42.298
"Adam" in a big old heart.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.126
That's it.
We can never break up.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.475
[chuckles]No, seriously.

05:45.519 --> 05:46.955
I can't be a middle-aged woman

05:46.998 --> 05:48.826
limited to guys named Adam.

05:48.870 --> 05:51.742
Bonnie, don't worry, I...
Ow!

05:51.786 --> 05:54.354
[stammers] What happened
to three, two, one?

05:57.182 --> 05:59.489
Crab roll, how do you plead?

05:59.533 --> 06:02.274
[high-pitched]:
Guilty of being delicious.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.670
[regular pitch]:
Mm, another smoothie, nice.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.411
I could get used to this.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.195
Don't.
I'm going home soon,

06:10.239 --> 06:12.110
and Jill doesn't know
how to use the blender.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.419
How's the studying going?

06:16.463 --> 06:17.899
Wow.

06:17.942 --> 06:20.858
Which part?

06:20.902 --> 06:23.687
The part
that's making me squint.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.689
That's the Bavarian
cut crystals.

06:25.733 --> 06:28.823
You're the first person to see
me in it, so you're welcome.

06:28.866 --> 06:31.565
I do feel kind of special.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.175
Guess how much it cost.

06:34.263 --> 06:35.569
Oh, we'll be here all day.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.962
$3,284.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.660
I'm sorry, what?

06:42.532 --> 06:46.928
I know it's a bit much,
but I'm a bit much.

06:46.971 --> 06:49.321
Oh, good. You know.

06:49.365 --> 06:50.801
Well, I'll let you get
back to your books.

06:50.845 --> 06:53.369
Oh, I almost forgot.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.458
It's the first of the month.
Do you have something for me?

06:55.502 --> 06:59.767
Um, a "welcome to November" hug?

06:59.810 --> 07:02.465
No, I'm talking about
the money you owe me.

07:02.509 --> 07:05.163
Oh. Wait, you want it now?

07:05.207 --> 07:06.774
Well, that's the payment plan
we agreed on.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.602
$75, first of every month.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.952
But if you don't have the cash,
you can just bring it tomorrow.

07:10.995 --> 07:14.216
I mean, I don't have any pockets
on this thing anyway.

07:14.259 --> 07:17.219
Right, got it.
I mean, I don't got it.

07:17.262 --> 07:21.179
But maybe by tomorrow, I'll get
it and then I'll give it to you.

07:21.223 --> 07:23.878
Okeydokey.
Oh-- thumbprint.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.575
Got to go Windex my tummy.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.233
Did she really
just ask me for 75 bucks?

07:31.276 --> 07:32.974
She did.

07:33.017 --> 07:35.324
While she's wearing
a $3,000 chandelier?

07:35.367 --> 07:36.630
Yes, indeed.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.893
God, rich people can be so...

07:38.936 --> 07:41.939
Shh. There are cameras
everywhere.

07:45.247 --> 07:48.032
My tattoo is still burning.
Is yours burning?

07:48.076 --> 07:50.382
Like a wildfire.
Isn't it great?

07:50.426 --> 07:52.428
No. Burning is bad.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.343
That's the whole premise
of hell.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.214
Come here, let me see
how yours turned out.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.520
Wait, uh, they say you should

07:57.564 --> 07:59.435
keep it covered
for at least 24 hours.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.350
Yeah. They also say you
shouldn't put Q-tips

08:01.393 --> 08:03.700
in your ears, but I ride
that high every morning.

08:04.962 --> 08:07.312
What the hell is "Bo"?

08:07.356 --> 08:08.749
Where's the rest of "Bonnie"?

08:08.792 --> 08:11.447
What? I always call you Bo.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.666
Since when?

08:12.709 --> 08:14.189
Since forever, Bo.

08:15.233 --> 08:17.192
Unbelievable.
You wimped out.

08:17.235 --> 08:20.282
Wimped out? I didn't even want
to do it in the first place.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.676
Whoa, wait. Are we in
the wrong apartment?

08:22.719 --> 08:23.938
Where's the wall?

08:23.981 --> 08:25.940
Don't worry, boss.
I'm fixing it.

08:25.983 --> 08:27.811
Why'd you break it?

08:27.855 --> 08:29.813
Water broke it.
Powerful thing, water.

08:29.857 --> 08:34.296
Created the Grand Canyon,
Niagara Falls, the moon.

08:34.339 --> 08:36.385
Aw, Tammy.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.474
Why couldn't you
just leave it alone?

08:38.518 --> 08:41.129
And let the people I love
get sick from black mold?

08:41.172 --> 08:43.131
Not on my watch.

08:43.174 --> 08:45.699
She's actually doing you
a favor, Bo.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.396
"Bo," I like that.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.398
Yeah, well, forget it,
'cause it's not gonna stick.

08:49.441 --> 08:52.357
[scoffs]
That's such a Bo thing to say.

08:55.230 --> 08:57.362
And here we have Travis.

08:57.406 --> 09:01.149
He's very fit, he appears to be
into weightlifting and travel.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.586
Ooh, he's cute. Swipe right.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.807
Next up is yet another Travis.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.417
Hey.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.419
Oh, hey. We're just playing
on Tinder.

09:10.462 --> 09:13.204
I know I can't date yet,
but I can still window-shop.

09:13.248 --> 09:16.033
I do the same thing
with health care.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.035
So, it was a slow
shift at work,

09:18.079 --> 09:20.037
but I went into
extra grovel mode

09:20.081 --> 09:21.648
and came up with
the money I owe you.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.388
Oh, thanks, sweetie.

09:23.432 --> 09:26.000
Um, still no pockets.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.611
Here, Belinda. Why don't
you get yourself a facial?

09:28.655 --> 09:30.308
You're looking a little clogged.

09:30.352 --> 09:33.877
Whatever makes
your world better.

09:33.921 --> 09:35.531
Jill, what the hell?

09:35.575 --> 09:36.619
What?

09:36.663 --> 09:38.621
I busted my butt for that money.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.971
It barely even stayed
in your hand for a second.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.756
So what?
You owed it to me.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.540
But you clearly
don't need it.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.933
But you owed it to me.

09:45.976 --> 09:48.413
But you don't need it.But you owed it to me.

09:48.457 --> 09:49.676
But you don't need it.

09:49.719 --> 09:52.156
But I'm not having
this conversation anymore.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.072
But you don't need it!Aah!

09:58.119 --> 10:00.208
This suit is not for swimming!

10:00.251 --> 10:02.514
Belinda, help!

10:02.558 --> 10:05.169
Don't touch my money.

10:07.171 --> 10:08.695
JILL:
Save the suit!

10:08.738 --> 10:10.740
Save the suit!

10:18.530 --> 10:20.054
I'm using a 120 grit.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.751
Thought about going
with the 240,

10:21.795 --> 10:23.405
but that's just
showboating.

10:23.448 --> 10:24.667
Are you talking to me?

10:24.711 --> 10:26.887
No, I completely forgot
you were there.

10:26.930 --> 10:30.673
Okay, second coat of plaster,
your turn to shine.

10:30.717 --> 10:33.458
Oh, thank God
you're back.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.808
Where you been?

10:34.851 --> 10:36.200
To the florist.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.028
I brought you
a little rose.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.551
Oh.
Where is it?

10:39.595 --> 10:42.467
In my pants. Kapow!

10:42.511 --> 10:43.686
You got another one?

10:43.730 --> 10:44.687
It took twice as long

10:44.731 --> 10:45.906
and felt twice as good.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.429
This is crazy.

10:47.472 --> 10:49.300
Yeah, I agree. A
rose with no thorns?

10:49.344 --> 10:51.085
Where's the poetry in that?

10:51.128 --> 10:52.739
Darn, you're right.

10:52.782 --> 10:55.045
No problem. Get me a guitar
string and some boot polish

10:55.089 --> 10:57.700
and I can thorn that bitch
up before lights-out.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.746
And there's the poetry.

11:02.052 --> 11:04.794
Rich people
are soulless bastards.

11:04.838 --> 11:07.536
They should all rot in hell.
Who are we talking about?

11:07.579 --> 11:11.192
Jill. Parading around in her
billion-dollar bathing suit,

11:11.235 --> 11:13.585
squeezing me
for a measly 75 bucks.

11:14.586 --> 11:16.632
You pushed me in my pool!

11:18.242 --> 11:19.679
Oh, and I pushed her
in her pool.

11:21.376 --> 11:23.160
I am not the bad guy here.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.336
What I do with my money
is my business.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.382
I can burn it,
I can blow my nose with it,

11:27.425 --> 11:29.384
or I can give it to a friend
who gambles it away

11:29.427 --> 11:31.081
instead of bailing out her mom.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.997
Here's the mirror, Christy.
Here's the mirror!

11:34.041 --> 11:36.173
Oh, yeah?

11:36.217 --> 11:37.740
I didn't... Did
you see a mirror?

11:37.784 --> 11:40.395
I didn't see a mirror.

11:40.438 --> 11:42.223
You really don't
get it, do you?

11:43.267 --> 11:45.835
You have no idea
what that money means to me.

11:45.879 --> 11:49.230
It's food on my plate,
gas in my car, books for school.

11:49.273 --> 11:51.232
I get that I have
to pay you back,

11:51.275 --> 11:52.886
but when you treat it
like it's meaningless,

11:52.929 --> 11:54.365
it's a slap in my face.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.628
Do you really think
this is about the money?

11:56.672 --> 11:59.631
I don't care about your money.
I care about you.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.808
The only reason I kept you
to that payment plan

12:01.851 --> 12:03.331
was to support your recovery.

12:03.374 --> 12:07.161
Well, that's... incredibly nice!

12:08.162 --> 12:09.424
And?

12:09.467 --> 12:10.947
Hang on, I wasn't prepared

12:10.991 --> 12:13.123
for you to make a good point.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.864
Oh, Lord, I'm cold,

12:14.908 --> 12:16.431
and I don't want
to do this anymore.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.650
If this debt is gonna ruin
our friendship,

12:18.694 --> 12:19.913
then just forget about it.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.698
Really?

12:22.742 --> 12:23.917
Yeah, we're square.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.791
Now, I got to pee,
and only Belinda knows how

12:28.835 --> 12:30.575
to get me out
of this disco ball.

12:33.578 --> 12:36.103
Yeah, Jill was a little pissed,

12:36.146 --> 12:38.061
but she realized
that we're both better off

12:38.105 --> 12:39.846
if she just lets me
off the hook.

12:39.889 --> 12:42.500
Yeah, actually, Christy, in
Gamblers Anonymous, we say...

12:42.544 --> 12:46.026
Stop. I'm happy, and what we say
always ruins it.

12:47.157 --> 12:48.376
Can you walk while you talk?

12:48.419 --> 12:49.638
You're blocking the ribs.

12:49.681 --> 12:52.380
Come here, kid.
Step into my office.

12:52.423 --> 12:56.253
Oh, I don't want to learn
while I eat.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.952
Listen to me.

12:58.995 --> 13:03.304
Paying back a debt is a crucial
part of the process.

13:03.347 --> 13:06.437
Agreed. And next time,
I will definitely do that.

13:06.481 --> 13:08.788
No. No, you're gonna
do it this time.

13:08.831 --> 13:11.268
See, every time
a debt goes away,

13:11.312 --> 13:12.879
you feel like you've beaten
the system,

13:12.922 --> 13:15.446
and that is not a healthy thing
for a gambler.

13:15.490 --> 13:18.319
You beat the system?
How'd you do it?

13:18.362 --> 13:20.321
Lucy, eat your ribs.

13:20.364 --> 13:23.803
[quietly]:
We'll talk later.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.631
The act of handing over
that money every month

13:26.675 --> 13:30.505
is a reminder to you of just how
dangerous gambling can be.

13:30.548 --> 13:32.420
And you need that reminder.

13:32.463 --> 13:35.684
Couldn't I just get "don't
gamble" tattooed on my arm?

13:35.727 --> 13:37.251
My mom knows a guy.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.296
Doesn't work.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.693
Hey, handsome.

13:44.736 --> 13:46.303
Hello.

13:46.347 --> 13:50.046
Put the magazine down.
Let's try this again.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.137
Hey, handsome.

13:54.181 --> 13:55.530
Hello.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.880
All right.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.013
Let's skip that part.

14:00.056 --> 14:03.233
Have I got a surprise for you.

14:03.277 --> 14:06.715
You have the sex drive
of a dude.

14:06.758 --> 14:11.415
What's a rose without
a... Hello, bumblebee.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.548
What is happening to you?

14:13.591 --> 14:15.376
I'm expressing
myself, blockhead.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.769
Bonnie, this is
getting out of control.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.728
Oh, relax. It's just
a couple of tats.

14:19.771 --> 14:22.905
And one temporary sketch of
something I'm thinking about.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.559
Oh, good God.

14:24.602 --> 14:25.734
Is that your face?

14:25.777 --> 14:27.301
Yeah, this way, no
matter how we do it,

14:27.344 --> 14:31.914
we'll always be
making eye contact.

14:34.830 --> 14:37.137
Her face?

14:37.180 --> 14:39.791
Yeah. And it's this big.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.445
Oh, that's not good.

14:41.489 --> 14:43.926
I'm just worried that she's
getting some kind of weird buzz

14:43.970 --> 14:46.233
off all these tats.
That's a red flag, right?

14:46.276 --> 14:47.974
This could lead
to drinking again.

14:48.017 --> 14:51.412
Not necessarily. Adam,
I love that you're looking out

14:51.455 --> 14:54.067
for Bonnie, and yeah, addicts
are feel-good junkies,

14:54.110 --> 14:56.373
but it doesn't mean
she's gonna drink.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.942
This big.

14:59.986 --> 15:03.946
Look, if she wants to get
tattoos, you can't stop her.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.383
And if she drinks,
you can't stop that, either.

15:06.427 --> 15:09.430
Nope.What do you mean, "nope"?

15:09.473 --> 15:10.910
I mean I don't accept that.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.129
There's got to be
something I can do.

15:13.173 --> 15:14.739
Well, you're right, there is.

15:14.783 --> 15:17.960
Okay, now your oatmeal's
kicking in. Lay it on me.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.658
There is a program
called Al-Anon.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.660
It's for people who live
with alcoholics.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.532
Whoa, why do I got to go
to meetings?

15:24.575 --> 15:27.622
I didn't do anything wrong.

15:27.665 --> 15:30.842
AA is for people who are
powerless over alcohol.

15:30.886 --> 15:34.977
Al-Anon is for people who are
powerless over the alcoholic.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.718
No, no, this isn't about me.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.111
You're not gonna
make this about me.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.808
This is about Bonnie.

15:39.851 --> 15:42.071
Because everything's about
Bonnie all the time.

15:42.115 --> 15:45.770
By the way, we're calling her Bo
from now on, so get on board.

15:45.814 --> 15:48.860
Thank you,
but we're handled here.

15:53.778 --> 15:56.607
Have a great day.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.307
Bye.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.527
More coffee?

16:03.571 --> 16:08.663
Yeah, I'm gonna have to wait for
him to come back for his keys.

16:08.706 --> 16:12.145
Okay, so we're going
Giant Bonnie?

16:12.188 --> 16:14.669
Yeah, but younger.
And with Farrah Fawcett hair.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.976
Okay, Randy.

16:17.019 --> 16:20.022
It's time to finish up
my dragon.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.676
So how long is this gonna take?

16:21.719 --> 16:23.895
Uh, about six hours.Ugh, awesome.

16:25.854 --> 16:29.684
Hey, how come her dragon
is flying by a fried egg?

16:29.727 --> 16:33.557
Oh, 20 years ago,
that was the sun.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.559
What's the basket?

16:35.603 --> 16:38.171
Oh, that used to be
the Golden Gate Bridge.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.824
Okay, put the needle down.
Wipe this off.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.130
What? What's wrong?

16:41.174 --> 16:42.218
Well, I don't want
to have to worry about

16:42.262 --> 16:43.915
both my faces getting old.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.527
Stop right now.
You're not doing this.

16:46.570 --> 16:47.702
Excuse me?You heard me.

16:47.745 --> 16:48.746
I forbid you.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.226
Oh, you "forbid" me?

16:50.270 --> 16:51.662
Pick up the needle, Earl.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.490
I'll wait till this plays out.

16:53.534 --> 16:54.883
I am not okay with the tats,

16:54.926 --> 16:56.711
and you are scaring
the hell out of me.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.582
Why?Because I have no control

16:58.626 --> 17:01.063
in this relationship,
and I got to do something

17:01.107 --> 17:03.544
because I'm freaking out
and I want to marry you,

17:03.587 --> 17:05.676
but I need to know that I--

17:05.720 --> 17:08.070
And, man, I have never said
the word "I" that much

17:08.114 --> 17:09.289
in my entire life.

17:09.332 --> 17:12.814
Oh, my God, this isabout me.

17:12.857 --> 17:14.685
Where are you going?

17:14.729 --> 17:16.470
To an Al-Anon meeting.

17:16.513 --> 17:20.822
I hope you're happy.
I'm as broken as you.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.565
You're marrying that guy?

17:24.608 --> 17:27.742
Well, I got no choice.
You tattooed his name on my ass.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.882
Hey, pretty.

17:37.926 --> 17:41.103
Any chance you were thinking
of crashing at Adam's tonight?

17:41.147 --> 17:43.062
What did you do?

17:43.105 --> 17:44.541
I moved the desk.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.108
Oh, Tammy, no.

17:46.152 --> 17:49.242
Yeah, I saw that dry rot
and pulled up floorboards.

17:49.285 --> 17:52.114
Anyway, it's Planet of the Ants
down there.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.289
What?

17:53.333 --> 17:54.943
Well, they were down there,
but my process

17:54.986 --> 17:56.727
seemed to rile them up
pretty good.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.773
I guess what
I'm trying to say is...

17:58.816 --> 18:00.862
The apartment is completely
filled with ants.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.255
Well, I haven't
checked upstairs,

18:02.298 --> 18:04.300
but they were marching
in that direction.

18:06.389 --> 18:10.045
Do you really think I'm pretty?

18:10.089 --> 18:12.526
So wait, now you do
want to pay me back?

18:12.569 --> 18:14.615
You were right.
It's part of my recovery.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.921
What you do with your money
is none of my business.

18:16.965 --> 18:19.707
You can throw it away,
you can prop a table up with it.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.275
I can come up with my own list.

18:22.318 --> 18:25.104
And you promise this isn't
gonna affect our friendship?

18:25.147 --> 18:26.975
Not unless I already
messed it up.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.455
Not a chance.

18:28.498 --> 18:30.587
I believe it was
Rob Lowe who said

18:30.631 --> 18:33.460
"friendship is
super important."

18:33.503 --> 18:36.332
Okay, now I want
to read that book.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.162
Oh, good, you guys made up.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.164
Listen, can she spend
the night at your place??

18:42.208 --> 18:46.299
'Cause our apartment's full
of ants, and they are biters.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.649
So now it's ourapartment?

18:48.692 --> 18:51.478
That's the part
that upset you?

18:51.521 --> 18:55.134
Where the hell is Al-Anon?
All these rooms look alike.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.005
Two doors down
on your right.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.485
Just look for
the exhausted people

18:58.528 --> 19:00.226
who have nowhere else to turn.

19:00.269 --> 19:03.881
Don't talk about
my people that way.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.841
You should be proud of him.

19:06.884 --> 19:09.322
It takes courage to walk
into one of these rooms.

19:09.365 --> 19:14.022
You got a good guy there, Bo.

19:14.065 --> 19:16.198
Oh, God, it's sticking.
