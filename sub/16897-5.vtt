WEBVTT

01:17.661 --> 01:19.914
Where are we going?

01:21.540 --> 01:25.511
Lydia. Uh, Lydia.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.091
Can...? Can we...?

01:31.091 --> 01:33.014
Yeah, Lydia, listen.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.349
I know maybe... Um, I think...

01:35.512 --> 01:39.267
Tanya said that, you know, there was,
I think, a big misunderstanding.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.486
Okay, I get that you're pretty sore at me.

01:47.399 --> 01:54.408
Maybe I didn't handle our, uh, situation
the right way and you're upset.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.246
Is this about me leaving the business?

01:56.408 --> 01:59.378
Because, you know,
that's not a done deal.

01:59.536 --> 02:02.836
I mean Africa can wait, if that's what...

02:04.166 --> 02:05.463
Fuck.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.186
- You think I'm blind?
- What? What?

02:20.349 --> 02:22.693
- Think I'm retarded?
- Lydia.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.024
I'm thinking I'm gonna
have sex with your penis...

02:25.187 --> 02:26.939
and get another penis instead?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.394
<i>Please say a command.</i>

02:58.095 --> 02:59.142
Call Tanya Scagle.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.227
Call Tabitha Kagen.
- Scagle.

03:01.390 --> 03:05.236
Call... Call Tanya Scagle.

03:05.394 --> 03:08.273
<i>Did you say, "Call Timothy Kilroy"?</i>

03:08.438 --> 03:12.238
Call Tanya Scagle.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.028
Dialing.

03:25.997 --> 03:29.592
- Ray, I've been calling you all night.
- Oh, man, is that your ho'?

03:29.751 --> 03:33.221
- She arrested me, Tanya.
- Who?

03:33.380 --> 03:37.351
- Lydia.
- Wait, where are you? Are you in jail?

03:37.509 --> 03:40.604
I'm at the Swift? Man, you know,
the sane on Crooks and Big Beaver.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.480
Why Swifty Mart?

03:42.639 --> 03:45.438
Tanya, I need you to put
your brain on, okay?

03:45.600 --> 03:48.729
I don't know.
She stopped for cigarettes.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.148
Okay, okay, okay,
did you try talking to her?

03:51.314 --> 03:53.282
- Maybe she's just...
- She won't talk to me.

03:53.442 --> 03:56.195
She's talking about a different penis.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.455
Last time I checked, I only got the one.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.707
Okay, you know what?
I will take care of it.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.790
I will call her and reason with her.
I will talk her off the cliff.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.922
You just... You sit tight
and you stay calm.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.630
Oh, my... Fuck. Oh, my God. Jesus.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.976
What?
- Lydia, hi. What's up?

04:24.765 --> 04:26.563
- Not much.
- That's cool.

04:26.725 --> 04:31.322
Are you feeling
a little stressed out lately maybe?

04:32.606 --> 04:33.983
Not really. Why?

04:34.149 --> 04:36.743
Um, I just felt uneasy
about the way we left things.

04:36.902 --> 04:40.577
I just thought maybe
you weren't completely satisfied.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.824
Oh, no, just peachy.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.289
The conversation
we had yesterday, very helpful.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.501
In fact, I love the new guy
you sent over without telling me.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.837
Lydia, you know what?
In retrospect, it was...

04:52.000 --> 04:54.469
<i>It was probably the wrong thing
for me to do...</i>

04:54.628 --> 04:58.258
to book you for our surprise plan.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.848
So why don't we just meet
and talk about it?

05:02.010 --> 05:04.854
I've got time. Do you have time right now?
I could come to you.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.686
- Sounds good, Tanya.
- Good.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.897
- Oh, shoot, I'm getting another call.
- No, no, no...

05:10.060 --> 05:11.733
No, no, no. Lydia, Lydia, Lydia.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.489
I could... Oh, fucking shit.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.491
Charlie, Charlie, sorry, sorry, sorry.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.072
I gotta...

05:18.235 --> 05:19.532
Uh...

05:19.820 --> 05:21.288
You gotta...

05:21.446 --> 05:23.790
Listen, I will...

05:24.115 --> 05:26.288
I will call you from the road.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.830
Yeah, crazy dude ho.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.041
- Hi.
- Mom!

05:33.208 --> 05:36.929
Your boss is here. Again.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.051
Matt.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.051
Hi.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.313
Is something wrong?

05:46.471 --> 05:48.098
No, no.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.313
But I was, uh...

05:50.475 --> 05:54.230
I felt a little awkwardness
back there earlier.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.569
Maybe we rushed it a little, maybe not.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.610
You are a beautiful woman.
We made love.

06:00.110 --> 06:04.786
I don't want you to feel like
tomorrow at the office...

06:04.948 --> 06:07.667
You be you. I'll be me.

06:09.661 --> 06:12.585
- You know what I mean?
- Uh...

06:13.748 --> 06:16.126
I can be me. Heh.

06:16.293 --> 06:20.343
That's what I was planning on.

06:20.505 --> 06:24.100
- Great.
- Yeah. Ha, ha.

06:26.011 --> 06:30.187
Okay, is that what you
came over to tell me?

06:30.348 --> 06:33.943
- Yes.
- That's great.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.354
Okay.

06:36.605 --> 06:41.987
Oh, and by the way, your job,
perfectly intact.

06:47.699 --> 06:48.951
See you tomorrow.

06:51.328 --> 06:54.673
Come on, you don't listen to me.
We've already established that.

06:54.831 --> 06:58.711
But this time I am really,
really listening, Charlie.

06:58.877 --> 07:03.007
- I have no idea what to do.
- I will tell you what not to do:

07:03.173 --> 07:06.598
Do not chase after a damn cop
who just arrested your ho.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.187
Cut him loose, T.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.641
Are you saying I should
leave my ho in custody?

07:13.642 --> 07:15.940
He's going downtown.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.401
Do you want to join him?

07:20.732 --> 07:25.704
Now is not the time to be playing games.
Lydia, listen. I cannot go to jail.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.206
I'm a father. I'm a teacher.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.039
I'm a girls' volleyball coach.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.670
Shh! Shut it.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.416
- You see that guy over there?
- What guy?

07:37.582 --> 07:41.758
- Top step, fat face, burly shoulders.
- You mean the policeman?

07:41.920 --> 07:47.518
Yeah. Does he look kind to you?
Does he look like Mr. Nice-Guy?

07:47.676 --> 07:50.304
I... Yeah, he looks okay.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.724
- He looks like an okay guy.
- Yeah? He's not okay.

07:54.933 --> 07:58.358
We're married three years tomorrow.

07:58.520 --> 08:02.150
You're married?
You're married. That's great.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.737
What's so great about it?

08:03.900 --> 08:09.407
He's an angry, self-centered prick
who likes to fuck 20-year-old prostitutes.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.166
- You want to meet him?
- You mean, for dinner?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.794
Nope, right now. Might be fun.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.172
No, I don't. Lydia, it's not fun.

08:18.873 --> 08:19.920
Uh...

08:20.083 --> 08:24.179
You have a phone?
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.635
Who's Jessica?
- My ex-wife.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.596
Just don't answer it, please.

08:28.758 --> 08:32.763
- You don't ignore your wife.
- No, no, no, it's my ex-wife.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.727
Hello, Jess.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.392
Hey, Dad, things are really bad here.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.561
Damon, what's going on?

08:41.062 --> 08:43.030
I am not a criminal
because I went on a date.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.362
Oh, it wasn't a date.
It was more than a date.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.277
- Stop judging me.
- It's gonna ruin...

08:47.444 --> 08:50.414
Maybe you should just get over here.
This shit is really blowing up.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.576
Damester, uh, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.790
I can't live here anymore.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.579
<i>It wasn't a date.</i>

08:57.746 --> 09:00.215
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.250
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

09:02.417 --> 09:07.514
My kids are fighting with their mom
and they want me to go over there.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.011
Where do they live?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.106
Jason, open the door.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.858
I know you're in there. Open the door.

09:20.602 --> 09:23.025
I can hear the television.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.983
You have to tell her.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.783
No? No? I'm gonna.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.289
- Sit. No.
- No, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.327
- Now, listen, Lenore...
- Where is he? Where were you?

09:36.951 --> 09:40.376
You left a client waiting tonight.
Where the hell were you?

09:42.499 --> 09:45.298
- What happened to your face?
- I don't feel well, Lenore.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.303
It's not that big of a deal.
Jason and I...

09:47.462 --> 09:50.841
Sandee, just shut the hell up.
Go feed the turtle.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.514
Tell me what?

09:53.676 --> 09:56.805
I went on another date.
I do what I want to do.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.644
You are not the boss of him.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.809
The other girl set it up
and she offered more.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.148
And we are not sorry at all.

10:05.230 --> 10:08.359
You took a client from Tanya?

10:08.525 --> 10:10.493
It was like a referral.

10:10.652 --> 10:17.536
But this woman went kind of
apeshit on me, like way rough.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.835
Let me see.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.626
- Ow! What the fuck?
- Stop it.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.757
Oh, did that hurt?

10:24.916 --> 10:28.216
I'm sorry. You know what really hurts?

10:28.378 --> 10:33.805
Taking something fragile and breaking it,
like someone's trust...

10:34.634 --> 10:38.980
- ...or this beautiful television.
- Oh, my God.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.686
Did that hurt?

10:40.849 --> 10:42.897
- Answer me when I call you.
- Thank you.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.777
Thank you, thank you, Lydia.

10:44.936 --> 10:48.691
Thank you. I'm... Really, for everything...

10:48.857 --> 10:52.578
You've got five minutes. You try to
run, I'll call an APB on your ass.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.404
Okay.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.377
<i>I'm close, Ray.
I'm very close. Where is she now?</i>

11:05.540 --> 11:07.508
She's waiting at the curb.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.294
<i>Did she calm down a little?</i>

11:09.460 --> 11:12.464
Yeah, she's full of joy, Tanya.
I gotta go.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.383
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

11:15.550 --> 11:18.144
Well, Damon called me
and wanted me to slop by.

11:18.303 --> 11:22.774
- Is that okay?
- Okay, father of the year, have at it.

11:22.932 --> 11:26.607
- Whoa, somebody going on a trip?
- Yeah, like us. Let's go.

11:26.769 --> 11:30.239
- Where are your shoes?
- Darb, what's going on?

11:30.398 --> 11:32.901
- I'll tell you in the car.
- Mom took the jeep key.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.535
She won't let us drive our car.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.947
I'm not gonna let you drive
when you are upset.

11:37.113 --> 11:40.162
Darby is traumatized, Mom.
He is your boss.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.544
He's worse than Ronnie.
He's gonna ruin everything.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.296
- He is my friend.
- I heard what he said.

11:45.455 --> 11:49.631
- You went on a date with that doctor?
- You stick up for me.

11:49.792 --> 11:54.389
- You stick up for me for once.
- Oh, I am sticking up for you.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.594
The doctor guy?

11:55.757 --> 11:58.135
You're just gonna marry him
and then ditch Dad again.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.895
Yeah, that's really independent.
Wash, rinse and repeat.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.681
Darby, I am not going to do that.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.942
I do not do that.
I learn from my mistakes.

12:06.601 --> 12:11.528
I grow. I get better.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.157
Okay, well, guys, I gotta, um...

12:17.612 --> 12:19.706
All right, everybody huddle up.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.741
- What?
- Come here, huddle up, guys.

12:21.908 --> 12:25.003
We don't wanna huddle up.
We wanna move back in with you.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.585
Well, your mom is, um...

12:27.872 --> 12:32.844
Look, from my side of things,
things aren't always black and white, okay?

12:33.002 --> 12:35.596
Now, put the bags down
and give your dad a hug, all right?

12:35.755 --> 12:36.927
Maybe he needs one too.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.514
Come on, guys.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.188
Come on.
We're on the same team here.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.566
We can't turn against each other.
We're family.

12:46.724 --> 12:49.603
We've gotta stick together.
We're Dreckers.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.147
Not Mom. She's a Haxon.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.776
Damon, cut it out. You love your mom.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.494
We love your mother.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.665
Okay, uh, good talk.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.122
Glad we did this.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.879
Guys, everything's gonna blow over.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.631
Unpack the bags, all right?

13:10.790 --> 13:13.259
Be good to your mother. Love you.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.680
Where were his shoes?

13:18.381 --> 13:22.056
<i>My family needed me,
and there I was, stuck with Rambo.</i>

13:24.554 --> 13:27.103
<i>What the hell was she
gonna do with me?</i>

13:32.312 --> 13:33.780
How did it go?

13:34.480 --> 13:37.905
I don't know.
It was okay, I guess, for five minutes.

13:38.067 --> 13:43.415
- How old are they?
- Seventeen, twins.

13:43.573 --> 13:49.330
- That's a tough age, huh?
- Yeah, tell me about it. You got kids?

13:49.495 --> 13:53.841
No. I mean, I wanted them.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.627
You know, I begged him all last year:

13:55.793 --> 13:59.639
"Why don't we have kids?"
But he didn't want to.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.885
He never wants
to do anything anymore.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.776
I love this song.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.684
- Did you call someone?
- What?

14:48.846 --> 14:51.770
Did you fucking call someone?

14:55.269 --> 14:57.067
Oh, fuck.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.040
Oh, God.

15:20.461 --> 15:24.841
- Get out of the car, please.
- Okay.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.411
- Lydia, I would like to...
Shh!

15:47.488 --> 15:50.788
- Ray, about the two penises...
- Don't. Just don'! even go there, Tanya.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.250
I think I might know
who the other penis is.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.256
- What?
- The other penis.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.134
It was Jason.

16:00.793 --> 16:05.515
Yeah, well, look, you weren't answering
your phone. And she threatened me.

16:05.673 --> 16:09.052
And you said you didn't want to
see her anymore, so I sent Jason.

16:09.218 --> 16:13.564
- What else was I supposed to do?
- You sent Jason instead of me?

16:13.723 --> 16:15.020
I...

16:15.183 --> 16:18.403
You sent that little clown
without telling her?

16:18.561 --> 16:20.689
Look, it was a calculated risk.

16:20.855 --> 16:24.280
Either she was gonna love him,
and be off our backs forever or...

16:24.442 --> 16:26.490
Or what? Or this?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.871
Are you two having a lovers' quarrel?

16:29.030 --> 16:32.125
- We're not lovers.
- That's accurate.

16:32.283 --> 16:35.457
- We've been lovers, but not anymore.
- Why you gotta tell her that?

16:35.620 --> 16:36.837
What does that accomplish?

16:36.996 --> 16:39.044
- It's the truth.
- You wanna tell her the truth?

16:39.207 --> 16:41.209
Why don't you tell her about Jason?
Go ahead.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.798
- Tell her whose idea that was.
- Fine, Ray. Maybe I will.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.838
- Go ahead.
- I'm gonna do it. I'm doing it.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.222
What are you gonna do?

16:49.425 --> 16:52.645
Lydia, I know you're feeling
very hurt right now.

16:52.803 --> 16:57.024
Very, very hurt and betrayed. Uh...

16:57.600 --> 17:00.444
It pains me to see you unhappy.

17:00.603 --> 17:04.574
When I found out you were a cop,
I panicked, Lydia.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.952
- I handled it very badly.
- You handled it like shit.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.539
Yes, I handled it like shit.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.585
Well, guess what, boys and girls,
we're back to plan A.

17:15.742 --> 17:20.294
Shit, that's him,
the husband, the big one.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.208
What the fuck? The cop?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.093
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.801
Lydia, Lydia, how nice that you're
married. Really, good for you.

17:27.964 --> 17:32.720
I mean, I've never been married myself,
but I believe in it. I still believe in it.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.604
Lydia, I'm sure your husband's very nice.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.767
Yeah, I'm sure he'll like you too.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.812
Lydia, listen, don't do this.
Lydia, I was a husband.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.323
Some secrets aren't meant
to be shared, Lydia.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.950
- What's the point of telling him now?
- Don't shout.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.157
What good is that gonna do?

17:51.988 --> 17:53.740
I don't give a fuck.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.034
I just want to see
what happens to his face.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.873
- No, no, no.
- Just to get back at him?

17:58.035 --> 17:59.912
- No, let me.
- Will you fucking be quiet?

18:00.079 --> 18:03.299
You know nothing about it. You fucked
me over just like he fucked me over.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.300
Now it's time
for both of you to suffer.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.461
No, men can be
jealous and irrational.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.722
No, we can talk about this.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.639
- What? They are.
- So are women.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.929
How rational is this?

18:16.721 --> 18:19.520
God, she's going in there. Ray?

18:19.682 --> 18:22.231
- Here goes.
- Oh, my God.

18:22.393 --> 18:25.067
Oh, my God,
she's fucking talking to him.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.072
She's talking to him.
She's talking to him.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.654
I can see that.
- She's pointing at us, Ray.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.785
- She's pointing at us.
- I can see that.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.618
Okay, he's looking at us.
He's looking at us right now.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.124
Fuck, Ray, he's gonna
fucking beat us up.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.752
- We're gonna fucking die.
- Keep it together, will you?

18:39.910 --> 18:42.004
We're not gonna die.
Nobody is gonna die.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.131
We're dead. We're dead.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.713
Dead! Dead sitting ducks.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.963
Okay, she's coming back.
She's coming back.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.508
- She's coming back.
- Yes, okay. Just act natural.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.017
I can't. I can't act natural.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.763
Fuck me.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.451
Uh, so...

19:17.031 --> 19:19.875
how'd it go?

19:20.034 --> 19:21.411
How'd it go?

19:21.577 --> 19:24.672
I told him you were a ho and a trick.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.959
I told him I found you
fucking in the park.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.718
And then...

19:33.547 --> 19:37.017
I asked him what he wanted
for breakfast.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.558
I told him I loved him.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.732
God, I'm pathetic.

19:42.890 --> 19:46.190
He destroys our marriage
and I just... I just...

19:46.352 --> 19:49.276
I stand there and I smile.

19:53.150 --> 19:58.828
Lydia, sometimes I feel pathetic too,
or I used to, but not anymore.

19:58.989 --> 20:03.244
Now I'm free to be me.
No handcuffs, no shackles, no masks.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.664
I'm just a woman, Lydia, just a woman.

20:05.830 --> 20:10.427
We are all just women,
except for men, who aren't women at all.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.713
But we are women, Lydia.
We are women.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.052
We are women. Hear us roar.

20:16.966 --> 20:20.266
We need to roar, Lydia. We can roar.

20:20.428 --> 20:23.147
Women have the hearts
the size of balloons, Lydia.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.307
Balloons filled with helium.

20:25.474 --> 20:29.854
Our hearts are hot-air balloons
filled with helium.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.273
Our hearts are the Hindenburg, Lydia.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.863
But we should not blow up, no, no.

20:35.025 --> 20:38.700
We should fill up. Lydia, fill your heart.

20:38.863 --> 20:42.538
Lydia, feel your heart. Lydia...

20:43.242 --> 20:45.085
This isn't necessary, come on.

20:45.244 --> 20:49.590
Lydia, this really... It isn't necessary.
Okay, take your time.

20:51.709 --> 20:55.430
- Take all the time you need.
- This is crazy.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.927
Are you just gonna leave her there?

21:01.093 --> 21:04.973
She's fine. What kind of person
do you think I am?

21:07.808 --> 21:10.186
You don't like me very much, do you?

21:10.352 --> 21:12.104
It's okay.

21:12.646 --> 21:16.321
- It's okay if you don't.
- I do like you, Lydia.

21:17.026 --> 21:21.076
I like the you sitting right here
right now, beside me.

21:21.864 --> 21:26.961
I like the you in the bathroom,
you know, until you hit me.

21:27.620 --> 21:31.625
I mean, I'm sorry your husband hurt you.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.338
I'm sorry...

21:35.586 --> 21:37.554
You hurt me too.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.809
Yeah, I know.

21:46.388 --> 21:50.393
They say it means nothing,
you know, men and whores.

21:52.937 --> 21:57.943
But when I'm with you,
it just doesn't feel like nothing.

22:02.696 --> 22:06.121
Well, you know,
women are different that way.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.341
You wanna fuck?

22:21.966 --> 22:24.185
It's the least I can do.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.014
No cops and robbers. No money.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.268
Just you and me.

22:48.826 --> 22:54.208
<i>So maybe this wasn't our finest hour,
Tanya handcuffed to a lamp post...</i>

22:54.373 --> 22:57.126
<i>me trying to screw my way
to freedom.</i>

22:57.293 --> 23:00.137
That's it, Ray. You've got this, Ray.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.923
We're gonna be fine.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.259
We're golden.

23:08.679 --> 23:11.979
God, Ray, come on,
fuck her and get it over with.

23:12.725 --> 23:16.025
<i>But, hey, no one said
Orgasmic Living was easy.</i>

23:19.732 --> 23:21.826
<i>People aren't easy.</i>

23:23.694 --> 23:28.370
<i>They fall in love, get married...</i>

23:30.743 --> 23:32.586
<i>drive each other nuts.</i>

23:37.958 --> 23:39.926
<i>We've all been there.</i>

23:44.340 --> 23:45.387
Okay.

23:45.549 --> 23:48.268
<i>Most of us just don't have
a badge and a gun.</i>

23:49.637 --> 23:51.059
- Come on.
- What?

23:51.221 --> 23:54.225
We're going home, Tanya.
We're going home.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.985
God, Ray, you motherfucker.
