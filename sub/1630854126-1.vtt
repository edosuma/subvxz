WEBVTT

00:02.219 --> 00:04.395
Aah!
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:04.439 --> 00:06.093
I am just so happy to be back.

00:06.136 --> 00:08.530
Um, I did this.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.663
Parted my hair
on a different side.

00:11.707 --> 00:14.057
But, oh, yeah,
you asked how my summer was.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.972
Um...

00:16.016 --> 00:19.541
Well, I broke up with Tariq,
as you know, which was...

00:19.584 --> 00:21.325
You know, break-ups are hard
for anyone.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.066
<i>♪ ...then rock wit' it♪</i>

00:23.110 --> 00:25.242
<i>♪ Do it to it, do it to it,
we gonna rock wit' it♪</i>

00:25.286 --> 00:26.809
I took it as an opportunity
to grow--

00:26.852 --> 00:29.116
not physically, of course,
because I can't reach

00:29.159 --> 00:31.031
the top shelves in my apartment.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.684
Tariq used to get the plates.

00:32.728 --> 00:35.948
But, ultimately, I was just so
excited to start the new year.

00:35.992 --> 00:38.995
Breaking up with Tariq was
so much the right choice that,

00:39.039 --> 00:41.432
you know, I was basically able
to fast-track that break-up.

00:41.476 --> 00:44.261
No crying, no depression,
"wah-wah."

00:44.305 --> 00:46.307
And no more bringing my problems
into school.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.309
That was old
right-sided-part Janine.

00:48.352 --> 00:49.701
I'm a fully formed adult,

00:49.745 --> 00:52.878
and this year
is gonna be... different.

00:54.184 --> 00:55.751
What the...?

00:55.794 --> 00:57.405
What in the world?

00:57.448 --> 01:00.147
Go, Eagles!

01:01.583 --> 01:03.106
Ava!

01:03.150 --> 01:04.499
<i>♪ That's how we do♪</i>

01:04.542 --> 01:06.718
Why is a man cooking ribs
in my parking spot?

01:06.762 --> 01:07.545
What is happening?

01:07.589 --> 01:08.981
It's game day, baby!

01:09.025 --> 01:10.505
It's Development Week.

01:10.548 --> 01:12.115
Here's a development-- You
either gotta park on the street

01:12.159 --> 01:13.682
or give me $50
for your spot.

01:13.725 --> 01:16.250
I'm making extra money.
For the school.

01:16.293 --> 01:18.034
So put out or back out.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.514
It's 8:30!

01:19.557 --> 01:21.559
Who even eats barbecue
this early?

01:21.603 --> 01:24.736
Let me get the beef tips.
I don't eat no pork.

01:24.780 --> 01:25.868
Hey, Janine!
Hey.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.652
Ay, this year's
gonna be different.

01:27.696 --> 01:31.221
Because the Eagles
got A.J. Brown!

01:31.265 --> 01:34.268
We back, baby!

01:35.704 --> 01:36.922
Another year.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.160
Ava, I see you.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.944
I saw you see me
make three trips.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.207
You couldn't
have helped me?

02:00.250 --> 02:02.296
I could've.
That was an option.

02:02.339 --> 02:05.255
Oh, God. Jacob.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.431
Oh, I missed you.
Please never go to Peru again.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.216
You not having service
was the worst.

02:09.259 --> 02:11.305
Oh, it's so nice to be called
Jacob again.

02:11.348 --> 02:12.784
After teaching abroad

02:12.828 --> 02:14.612
and being called <i>
el diablo blanco</i> every day,

02:14.656 --> 02:16.397
I really started
to feel like <i>basura.</i>

02:16.440 --> 02:19.008
-Oh.
-Did somebody say "trash"?

02:19.051 --> 02:20.401
Welcome back, dorks!

02:20.444 --> 02:23.143
And welcome back,
Abbott Elementary staff!

02:23.186 --> 02:24.448
Let's have a great
Development Week.

02:24.492 --> 02:27.190
I'll see you guys
in the auditorium at 9:00.

02:27.234 --> 02:28.844
We'll be there.

02:28.887 --> 02:32.021
Most people think school
starts when the kids get here,

02:32.064 --> 02:34.502
but it actually starts now,
at Development Week.

02:34.545 --> 02:35.764
Teachers prep for the year.

02:35.807 --> 02:38.506
We get ready,
get our curriculum,

02:38.549 --> 02:41.378
we research our students,
make plans.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.250
It's the calm before the storm.

02:43.293 --> 02:44.990
It's very zen, actually.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.253
Aah!

02:48.820 --> 02:51.258
Barbara!

02:52.215 --> 02:53.695
I missed you so much.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.218
Oh, my gosh.
I'm gonna give you a hug.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.133
Let me put these boxes d--Ah-ah-ah!

02:57.177 --> 02:59.483
I had a fantastic summer.

02:59.527 --> 03:02.573
After my cruise to Jamaica--
all-inclusive--

03:02.617 --> 03:05.663
I worked with Ava to properly
appropriate the funds

03:05.707 --> 03:08.013
that we got
from the grant last year.

03:08.057 --> 03:09.493
And I found out in early July

03:09.537 --> 03:12.757
that I would be welcoming
a student who uses a wheelchair,

03:12.801 --> 03:17.240
so I was very excited to be able
to use part of that grant money

03:17.284 --> 03:18.894
to get a new ramp installed.

03:18.937 --> 03:22.680
My next goal is to get that
student the appropriate desk...

03:22.724 --> 03:26.423
and follow up on the shoes
I lost on the cruise.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.947
I was very inebriated.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.253
Oh!

03:30.297 --> 03:33.822
Sea Barbara is different
than Land Barbara.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.305
Hurry up.
Quiet down.

03:38.348 --> 03:41.569
Be silent in the presence
of greatness.

03:42.613 --> 03:43.745
How was y'all's summer?

03:43.788 --> 03:45.268
Oh, it was good. I--Rhetorical.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.748
Let's get into it.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.273
Oops!

03:50.317 --> 03:53.145
Gregory.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.973
I said, "Oops."

03:55.017 --> 03:56.497
Oh.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.890
I'm a full-time teacher now.
I'm excited about that.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.457
I spent time
going over the materials,

04:00.501 --> 04:01.676
so really got it down,

04:01.719 --> 04:03.025
so I'm ready
to take the year on.

04:03.068 --> 04:05.070
These first-graders
won't know what hit 'em.

04:05.114 --> 04:06.550
I mean that in a positive way.

04:08.770 --> 04:11.033
It's all in the knees.

04:11.076 --> 04:14.602
So, while in Peru,
I took level-one ASL courses.

04:14.645 --> 04:17.039
I wouldn't say I was inspired
by "CODA," per se,

04:17.082 --> 04:20.303
but it did--
it did have an impact on me.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.522
Look, here's the thing--

04:21.565 --> 04:23.088
words cannot express
my excitement

04:23.132 --> 04:25.352
to teach the others
the knowledge I have gained.

04:25.395 --> 04:28.398
So let me sign it.

04:28.442 --> 04:29.921
Me and Gary,
the vending machine guy,

04:29.965 --> 04:31.923
we spent the whole summer
down at the Jersey Shore.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.709
Nothing like the smell
of cigarettes and vinegar.

04:34.752 --> 04:37.712
I don't smoke or nothin'.
Just, I like being around it.

04:37.755 --> 04:40.192
It reminds me
of my childhood.

04:40.236 --> 04:43.457
This week, we'll have some
entry-level planning meetings,

04:43.500 --> 04:45.285
a mental-health
maintenance session,

04:45.328 --> 04:47.417
a session
on wrap-around introduction,

04:47.461 --> 04:50.899
an ASL course--Taught by me.

04:50.942 --> 04:53.815
And a mixer
held by Ms. Teagues.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.860
May we not pass out
from boredom.

04:55.904 --> 04:58.689
Because of teacher shortages,
some classes will be combined.

04:58.733 --> 05:01.083
Guys, the mixer's actually
going to be great.

05:01.126 --> 05:03.303
I've ordered Danny Wok's
and Dunkin' Donuts,

05:03.346 --> 05:04.173
so take your pick.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.348
Ooh!

05:05.392 --> 05:06.784
And also, I've added
a new segment,

05:06.828 --> 05:08.656
"Wisdom Swap,"
where more senior teachers

05:08.699 --> 05:10.614
can give advice
to the younger teachers.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.399
Sweetheart,
that'll never work.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.749
Yeah,
-it's a waste of time.
-Mm.

05:14.792 --> 05:15.837
I disagree.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.142
I'm positive
having something like this

05:17.186 --> 05:20.885
when I started out
would've really helped, and...

05:20.929 --> 05:23.888
And I don't have
to change your minds,

05:23.932 --> 05:25.325
because it's mandatory.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.022
So I will see you there.

05:28.502 --> 05:31.026
Looks like somebody
got it together this year.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.810
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

05:32.854 --> 05:36.118
This is exactly what I want
for myself this year.

05:36.161 --> 05:38.816
Like, what break-up?
I'm a hundred percent.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.688
And I'm happy
they're noticing.

05:40.731 --> 05:44.126
Even if they aren't noticing
my part change. Yet.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.780
Hey.

05:45.823 --> 05:47.695
Y'all have something
you want to share with
the rest of the group?

05:47.738 --> 05:50.785
As a matter of fact, Ava,
I do.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.700
Um, in addition
to a "wisdom swap"

05:52.743 --> 05:55.703
at today's mixer,
I have another little surprise.

05:55.746 --> 05:58.488
She pregnant.
I knew it.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.838
After making
many phone calls

06:00.882 --> 06:04.146
and pretending to slip on
a beer can at the Flyers' arena,

06:04.189 --> 06:06.061
I've managed to get
the only celebrity that matters

06:06.104 --> 06:08.585
to come surprise our kids
on the first day of school.

06:08.629 --> 06:11.283
America's favorite
orange, furry sweetheart...

06:12.415 --> 06:13.590
...Flyers mascot Gritty!

06:13.634 --> 06:15.200
Yes!

06:15.244 --> 06:17.377
-Yes!
-You should've said that
as soon as you stood up.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.074
No need for
those other words you said.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.162
Yes, Janine!

06:20.205 --> 06:22.164
The kids
are gonna love this.

06:22.207 --> 06:24.166
-Yes!
-I know, right?

06:24.209 --> 06:25.733
I don't get Gritty.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.606
What's not to get,
Gregory?

06:30.738 --> 06:32.435
He just doesn't make sense
to me.

06:32.479 --> 06:35.612
Like, my dad's landscaping
business' mascot is a bush.

06:35.656 --> 06:38.093
Because "bush"...
"landscaping."

06:38.136 --> 06:41.488
So, Gritty...

06:41.531 --> 06:42.619
It's Gritty.

06:42.663 --> 06:45.927
Hockey, Philadelphia, America.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.015
Penalty boxes.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.451
I think you should let it go, man.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.497
I'm chillin'.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.846
Good job, Janine.

06:51.889 --> 06:54.588
<i>Very</i> good job, Janine.
Hell yeah!

06:54.631 --> 06:55.719
Yes!

06:55.763 --> 06:58.069
Um...

06:58.113 --> 06:59.506
Oh. Who is that?
Is that Gritty?

06:59.549 --> 07:01.551
Is his area code 215
or 267?

07:01.595 --> 07:04.772
Um, no, no, no, no.
It's no one. It's spam.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.470
Melissa?

07:07.514 --> 07:09.429
Yeah?
Some news for you.

07:09.472 --> 07:10.647
You're gonna have
a combined

07:10.691 --> 07:11.953
second- and third-grade class
this year.

07:11.996 --> 07:12.867
What?

07:12.910 --> 07:14.172
Charter school
up the street

07:14.216 --> 07:15.957
took all our third-graders
with high test scores,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.394
and there aren't enough kids for
another full third-grade class.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.917
How many extra kids?

07:19.961 --> 07:20.744
10.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.920
I mean, great.

07:24.487 --> 07:25.488
I can get you an aide.

07:25.532 --> 07:26.924
No, thanks!

07:26.968 --> 07:28.839
My summer was great.
Thanks for asking.

07:28.883 --> 07:31.494
I got a hookah flavor
named after me-- Ava-lade.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.757
Notes of malt liquor
and marmalade.

07:33.801 --> 07:36.020
This first-grade curriculum
is nuts.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.153
They expect us to get through
all this in one school year?

07:38.196 --> 07:39.546
Are they for real?

07:39.589 --> 07:41.809
Sweetheart, it happens
like this every year.

07:41.852 --> 07:44.464
The school district decides
what we are capable of

07:44.507 --> 07:46.596
if we use every minute
of the day.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.772
It is completely theoretical.

07:48.816 --> 07:51.471
Don't want my students
to fall behind.

07:51.514 --> 07:52.733
If this is what
they expect of us,

07:52.776 --> 07:54.735
then it can't be unrealistic.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.998
Welcome to the Philly
public school system,

07:57.041 --> 08:00.305
where you never have
what you need.

08:00.349 --> 08:02.003
Who you on with?

08:02.046 --> 08:04.788
The district has been giving me
the runaround about that desk.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.486
Oh!
Pray for me.

08:06.529 --> 08:09.793
And if I don't get that desk,
pray for the district.

08:09.837 --> 08:12.317
Oh, I think
I got somebody!

08:12.361 --> 08:14.189
Yello?

08:14.232 --> 08:15.930
Hello?

08:17.975 --> 08:20.891
Somewhere around 2003,
my phone number got mistakenly

08:20.935 --> 08:24.808
entered into several places in
the school district's directory.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.201
I never said anything

08:26.244 --> 08:28.377
because I like to help out
wherever I can.

08:28.420 --> 08:32.468
<i>
So can you get us a replacement
fire extinguisher or not?</i>

08:32.512 --> 08:34.165
One sec.

08:34.209 --> 08:35.123
No.

08:36.037 --> 08:37.517
Knock-knock.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.997
Or as we say in ASL...

08:41.042 --> 08:42.739
Uh...

08:42.783 --> 08:44.219
But that's sound.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.221
Yeah, well, we didn't
really work on entrances.

08:46.264 --> 08:47.788
Hey, for my presentation,

08:47.831 --> 08:49.354
it's looking like
I could use a partner,

08:49.398 --> 08:52.619
somebody to pretend to know
nothing about ASL, unlike me.

08:52.662 --> 08:54.316
Uh, what do you say?
You want to do it?

08:54.359 --> 08:55.665
Yeah.

08:55.709 --> 08:58.842
Ooh, I should add an
interactive portion to my mixer.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.844
Something hands-on,
something, um--

09:00.888 --> 09:02.411
Oh! You know what you could do
to jazz it up?

09:02.454 --> 09:04.848
Remember that "36 Questions"
from <i>The New York Times?</i>

09:04.892 --> 09:06.850
I mean, it's all about
falling in love, but--

09:06.894 --> 09:09.200
But that's what I want
the teachers to do anyway.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.376
Oh, my God. That would make
a great icebreaker!

09:11.420 --> 09:12.421
I got you.
Let me look it up.

09:12.464 --> 09:14.205
Oh! Yes.

09:18.035 --> 09:21.256
Is everything okay?
your rent?

09:22.474 --> 09:24.215
Is that, uh,
one of the questions?

09:24.259 --> 09:25.565
Seems kind of specific.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.262
No, no.
This e-mail.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.047
Um...

09:30.091 --> 09:31.266
Yeah, no,
everything is fine.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.311
Like, everything's
completely okay.

09:33.355 --> 09:36.053
It's just that Tariq and I
used to split the rent 80/20,

09:36.097 --> 09:38.012
and now that 20's
in Bushwick.

09:38.055 --> 09:41.232
But it's totally okay.
Ignore that.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.757
Um, yeah, just find
the liberal love thingy.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.672
Just don't worry about it.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.165
Hey...

10:01.209 --> 10:02.819
Oh.

10:03.777 --> 10:04.865
What is this?

10:04.908 --> 10:06.344
I mapped out
the entire school year

10:06.388 --> 10:08.216
so I can meet every one of
the district's mandated goals.

10:08.259 --> 10:09.870
I scheduled everything
down to the hour.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.306
Now, I didn't allot
for this conversation,

10:11.349 --> 10:13.438
so if we could wrap this up
in the next... two minutes,

10:13.482 --> 10:14.570
that'd be very helpful.

10:14.614 --> 10:18.966
Well, I am very...

10:19.009 --> 10:22.447
Gregory, what if something
goes wrong

10:22.491 --> 10:25.755
and you a get
a millisecond off of

10:25.799 --> 10:27.844
this very...
impressive map?

10:27.888 --> 10:29.280
I accounted for that.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.673
Imagining the worst thing
that could possibly happen

10:30.717 --> 10:32.240
is one of
my best qualities.

10:32.283 --> 10:34.242
But what if one of the students
understands the lesson

10:34.285 --> 10:35.635
and another one doesn't?

10:35.678 --> 10:37.375
What if a cold runs through
the classroom

10:37.419 --> 10:40.204
and several students
are out for a few days?

10:40.248 --> 10:42.076
What if
there's a snow day?

10:43.077 --> 10:45.732
Oh, and I see that
you are getting Samir.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.211
I had him last year.

10:47.255 --> 10:50.040
Lovely student.
Very intelligent.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.738
Have you allotted for
the nosebleeds

10:51.781 --> 10:53.653
that he gets
when he's excited?

10:54.741 --> 10:57.134
Will this work as a desk
for your student, Mrs. Howard?

10:57.178 --> 11:01.399
Mr. Johnson, that is a dining
table from the cafeteria,

11:01.443 --> 11:03.488
and you are a fool.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.099
Oh!

11:05.142 --> 11:07.275
No luck on the desk,
-I'm assuming. Yeah.
-No luck on the desk.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.712
And you would think that the
school would be ready for this.

11:09.756 --> 11:13.063
We've had students
that use wheelchairs before.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.978
Mrs. Howard, Gregory,
I'm glad you're in one place.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.066
I have an emergency.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.024
What's up?
What's wrong?

11:17.067 --> 11:18.721
Well, here is the thing...

11:18.765 --> 11:20.027
You know
I'm outta here.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.029
I'm not playing with that boy
this year.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.900
Janine might be
getting evicted,

11:23.944 --> 11:25.946
but she kind of pretended
like it wasn't a big deal.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.599
Really?
Yeah.

11:27.643 --> 11:30.037
And as someone who has
been asked to leave
a hostel in Lisbon,

11:30.080 --> 11:31.995
I know it is
a very big deal, okay?

11:32.039 --> 11:33.997
I don't want her to experience
anything like that.

11:34.041 --> 11:37.522
Do you have like five minutes
to just talk to her?

11:37.566 --> 11:39.786
Hey.

11:39.829 --> 11:40.874
You about to get evicted?

11:40.917 --> 11:43.528
Uh, buy a lady dinner first,
geez!

11:43.572 --> 11:45.835
Look, I know you went through
a lot at the end of last year,

11:45.879 --> 11:47.881
so I'm just trying
to be a good... friend.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.535
-We both are.
-Good friends
with big mouths.

11:50.579 --> 11:51.885
Well,
I had to tell Gregory

11:51.928 --> 11:53.669
because you lied to my face
about that e-mail.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.018
I forgive you.

11:55.062 --> 11:58.065
Also, I may have told Barbara
and Ava and Melissa.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.762
But, again,
you lied, so...

11:59.806 --> 12:00.850
Okay.

12:00.894 --> 12:03.374
I did not lie.
I have a plan.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.594
My landlord and I
have a repartee.

12:05.637 --> 12:06.856
I don't pay the rent,

12:06.900 --> 12:08.075
he says, "You need
to pay the rent."

12:08.118 --> 12:09.337
I say, "The check
is in the mail,"

12:09.380 --> 12:10.817
he says, "You need
to pay online."

12:10.860 --> 12:12.253
-It's what we do.
-Look, I'm-- I'm assuming

12:12.296 --> 12:14.081
that paying is harder because
you don't have Tariq--

12:14.124 --> 12:17.867
Guys, you see how I'm hanging up
this bulletin board with ease?

12:17.911 --> 12:21.566
See how I got <i>the</i> Gritty to come
for the first day of school,

12:21.610 --> 12:22.959
despite his packed schedule?

12:23.003 --> 12:24.961
I'm doing fine.

12:25.005 --> 12:26.267
I'm breezing through
this break-up

12:26.310 --> 12:28.225
and handling it
like any adult would.

12:31.707 --> 12:36.712
Well, Janine, I must say,
I am thoroughly impressed.

12:36.756 --> 12:37.800
Mm-hmm.
Oh!

12:37.844 --> 12:39.062
Thank you so much.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.890
And, guys, we are
just getting started.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.719
Um, yeah, I've got
a killer icebreaker planned.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.112
Most infamous parties
in history?

12:45.155 --> 12:47.592
Donner, Boston Tea,
and, uh, this one.

12:48.724 --> 12:49.681
You need any, um...

12:49.725 --> 12:51.031
Oh, no, no, no.

12:51.074 --> 12:54.425
I got it, because I am
killing today.

12:54.469 --> 12:55.426
Damn it.

12:55.470 --> 12:56.993
Look, let me help you, alright?

12:57.037 --> 12:59.213
Okay, so do me a favor--
pull this through.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.258
Over there.
Mm-hmm.

13:01.302 --> 13:04.566
-So this is going well.
-Yeah, it is.

13:04.609 --> 13:05.915
And you're good?

13:05.959 --> 13:09.571
Yeah, so good.
I'm, like, yeah, so...

13:09.614 --> 13:11.965
Um, so... Alright.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.881
How, um-- How's, uh,
the Taylor thing?

13:14.924 --> 13:16.926
The thing with, uh, Taylor?
How's that?

13:16.970 --> 13:18.623
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah.
It's good.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.929
Good.
It's good, yeah.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.409
-I'm so happy to hear that.
-It's good, yeah.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.847
And, um, are you dating
anyone new, or...?

13:24.891 --> 13:26.196
Nope.
Great.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.807
'Cause I'm just focusing
on the school year, right?

13:27.850 --> 13:29.678
I feel you. Yeah.
You know,
just want to make sure

13:29.721 --> 13:33.551
I am killing... it.

13:33.595 --> 13:37.947
Guys! Now it is time
to get this party started.

13:37.991 --> 13:41.298
Hey there!
Anybody drive a beat-up sedan?

13:43.344 --> 13:46.347
Okay, what about a silver one
with a bumper sticker that says,

13:46.390 --> 13:48.131
"If you can read this,
thank a teacher"?

13:48.175 --> 13:50.481
Oh, that's mine.
Why?

13:50.525 --> 13:52.527
Because your car is about to get
a boot put on it.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.399
-Janine.
-What?!

13:57.967 --> 13:59.577
Uh, um, excuse me.

13:59.621 --> 14:02.276
Hi! What's happening?
I'm not even in the red.

14:02.319 --> 14:05.192
No, but you have seven
outstanding unpaid
parking violations.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.281
Oh, those are my ex's, yeah.

14:07.324 --> 14:09.761
I used to pay them for him,
but in an act of maturity,

14:09.805 --> 14:12.808
I haven't since we split,
so those are his responsibility.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.157
Oh, no, Janine.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.159
The tickets are on your car--
your tickets.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.465
That's how it works.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.120
Um, hey, don't you have,
like, a guy

14:20.163 --> 14:21.338
in parking enforcement
or something?

14:21.382 --> 14:23.340
No, I got a guy
in enforcement,

14:23.384 --> 14:25.473
but that's like
a last-resort kind of call.

14:26.778 --> 14:29.869
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Please don't do this.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.522
I can't afford to pay
those tickets,

14:31.566 --> 14:32.828
and I really need my car.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.351
I'm a teacher at that school,

14:34.395 --> 14:37.789
and normally we have spots,
but... the Eagles...

14:37.833 --> 14:38.878
Please don't do this.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.096
Sorry,
it's out of my hands.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.706
It's literally
in your hands.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.231
You know what?
I have a solution!

14:44.274 --> 14:46.015
-I'll just move my car. Yeah.
-No!

14:46.059 --> 14:47.495
No, I'm just gonna move it.

14:47.538 --> 14:48.975
-You can't boot a moving car!
-No, Janine, sweetheart.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.628
-That would be crazy!
-That's a bad solution.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.543
No, no, Janine. Janine.
No, no.

14:52.587 --> 14:54.328
-Stop!
-Barbara, back up!
Barbara, back up!

14:54.371 --> 14:55.546
Back up, back up, back up.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.856
Stop, stop, stop!
Stop!

15:00.900 --> 15:01.901
What?

15:02.989 --> 15:05.905
What?

15:05.948 --> 15:07.080
What the hell, Gritty?

15:07.123 --> 15:09.212
You're supposed to be here
next Monday!

15:09.256 --> 15:10.518
What are you doing here?

15:13.738 --> 15:16.002
Okay. He says he's scheduled
for today.

15:16.045 --> 15:18.265
What?
No.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.139
I got my days wrong.

15:23.183 --> 15:27.361
I told the Flyers the first day
of school for us, not the kids.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.364
Okay, and I'm just
paraphrasing here,

15:30.407 --> 15:32.496
but he says that because
of his tight schedule,

15:32.540 --> 15:34.629
he probably won't be able
to come back next week.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.025
Oh!

15:39.068 --> 15:40.287
You okay?

15:42.289 --> 15:45.422
Mm.
He says, "Poor Janine."

15:48.643 --> 15:49.949
Janine, what is going on?

15:49.992 --> 15:51.385
Unpaid parking tickets,

15:51.428 --> 15:53.865
landlord troubles,
this outfit?

15:53.909 --> 15:55.650
Okay, that's normal.

15:55.693 --> 15:59.306
But the rest of this,
it just doesn't feel like you.

16:00.785 --> 16:03.788
I didn't want my break-up
to interfere with my life,

16:03.832 --> 16:06.356
but I can't pay my bills.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.967
And I'm sad.

16:08.010 --> 16:11.144
I hate to admit that,
but I'm sad.

16:11.187 --> 16:14.408
When the water company
called about my bill,

16:14.451 --> 16:17.585
I was more upset about
how I miss yelling at Tariq

16:17.628 --> 16:19.108
for taking
two-hour showers.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.370
In <i>this</i> climate?

16:20.414 --> 16:22.503
I thought coming into work
a full adult

16:22.546 --> 16:25.288
would be my solution,
but I'm drowning.

16:25.332 --> 16:28.813
Janine,
you've had a break-up.
Yeah.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.076
They are hard.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.295
But they're part of
becoming whole,

16:32.339 --> 16:34.123
and if you let it,

16:34.167 --> 16:36.996
it's part of becoming the adult
you want to be.

16:37.039 --> 16:39.215
I've been through it.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.696
Melissa's on her journey,
and Ava, she's--

16:41.739 --> 16:44.481
Don't put them glizzies
too close to my rack, oldhead!

16:44.525 --> 16:47.354
Okay, look, what Barbara
is trying to say is,

16:47.397 --> 16:50.226
you just got to go through it,
not over it.

16:50.270 --> 16:53.360
And you're at the beginning,
not the end.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.892
Aww.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.682
I'mma have to Photoshop Janine
out of this,

17:11.726 --> 17:13.597
but this is
a cute picture, though.

17:20.561 --> 17:21.649
You all right?

17:21.692 --> 17:25.479
Everything is chaos.
And we all lose.

17:25.522 --> 17:26.915
Okay.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.483
That Janine-Gritty-boot
fiasco

17:29.526 --> 17:31.050
made me lose a whole mod
of scheduling.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.182
I don't know what I'm gonna do
when the year starts.

17:33.226 --> 17:34.618
Gregory...

17:36.403 --> 17:39.710
Being a teacher is being asked
to do the impossible

17:39.754 --> 17:41.277
year after year.

17:41.321 --> 17:45.281
And our only solution
is to show up every day

17:45.325 --> 17:47.022
and try our best.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.894
But it shouldn't be that way.
It's like we're set up to fail.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.548
But what are
we supposed to do?

17:51.592 --> 17:53.420
Throw out
all of our efforts?

17:53.463 --> 17:56.988
Take my situation,
for instance.

17:57.032 --> 18:01.123
Looks like I won't be getting
that desk for my student.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.125
But I did get the ramp.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.433
That's true.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.174
Mm-hmm.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.874
And, Gregory...

18:12.917 --> 18:14.049
Hmm?

18:14.093 --> 18:16.312
Take all of this down

18:16.356 --> 18:19.707
before someone gets worried
and calls the police.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.448
Mm!

18:33.329 --> 18:35.418
I've picked up
things fast my whole life.

18:35.462 --> 18:39.118
Fast walker, fast talker,
fast reader.

18:39.161 --> 18:43.774
Not a fast healer, though.
Some things can't be rushed.

18:43.818 --> 18:46.473
I have to be willing to admit
that I miss Tariq.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.779
And that I need
to pay my bills.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.695
So thank goodness Jacob
was able to loan me some money.

18:51.739 --> 18:54.959
I gave her the money I was gonna
use for my student-loan payment.

18:55.003 --> 18:57.745
President Joey B's gonna cancel
the rest of that debt

18:57.788 --> 18:59.834
like any day now.

19:03.838 --> 19:06.319
Is everybody excited
for the first day of school?

19:06.362 --> 19:08.321
You have a good summer?
Everyone have fun?

19:08.364 --> 19:11.193
Gregory got his dad to let us
borrow this costume.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.848
I'm no Gritty,
but these kids don't care.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.197
And Gregory paid me.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.459
You know what they say--

19:16.503 --> 19:19.636
$20 in my hand
is worth me in a bush.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.986
Straight line,
straight line, straight--

19:22.030 --> 19:23.988
Oh, welcome!

19:24.032 --> 19:26.208
Good morning.
Thank you.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.039
Hello.

19:31.082 --> 19:34.825
My name is J-A-C-O-B.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.485
Oh, nice to meet you, Imani.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.705
We're looking for
Ms. Schemmenti?

19:44.748 --> 19:46.620
-That's me.
-Third-grade teacher?

19:46.663 --> 19:48.230
Oh. Yeah.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.840
Okay.
How many we got?

19:49.884 --> 19:51.320
Okay.
Just line up.

19:51.364 --> 19:55.150
Follow Ms. Schemmenti.
Everybody follow Ms. Melissa.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.630
Let's go.

19:56.673 --> 19:57.979
Everybody...

19:58.022 --> 20:01.635
There we go. Alright.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.205
Barbara had mentioned that
there were once students here

20:06.248 --> 20:07.771
who needed ADA desks,

20:07.815 --> 20:09.469
and I doubted that somebody
had just thrown those away,

20:09.512 --> 20:11.862
so I asked Mr. Johnson
if there was storage here.

20:11.906 --> 20:15.518
He said, "Yeah, I forgot
because I'm a custodian

20:15.562 --> 20:18.434
and not some lil'
storage-ass ho."

20:18.478 --> 20:20.828
Anyway, I went down
to the school's basement

20:20.871 --> 20:21.916
and I found that.

20:24.484 --> 20:25.833
Mrs. Howard was right.

20:25.876 --> 20:28.879
We may not be able
to do it all...

20:28.923 --> 20:30.794
but we'll do what we can.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.448
-Come on, guys.
-Okay, guys.

20:32.492 --> 20:34.058
Let's wait.
It's gonna be
a great year.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.364
It is, isn't it?

20:35.408 --> 20:37.061
Oh, I like what you did
with your hair.

20:37.105 --> 20:38.933
The part?
It's nice.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.374
Go ahead,
y'all.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.943
Gritty!

20:48.986 --> 20:50.901
Oh!

20:50.945 --> 20:52.207
Ain't he cool?

20:52.251 --> 20:53.774
Look at him picking
that belly-button lint.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.993
Celebrities!
They're just like us.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.952
Grittay! My man!

20:57.995 --> 20:59.258
Your mom doing all right?

21:16.971 --> 21:21.323
I get it now.
I'm not <i>not</i> a fan.
