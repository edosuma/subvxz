02:51.043 --> 02:52.501
Alright everyone.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.335
The race is around the factory
and back.

02:55.751 --> 02:57.199
No second place.

02:57.524 --> 02:59.116

Who's in?

03:00.293 --> 03:01.650

03:03.176 --> 03:04.750
A case of TEC-9s (gun).

03:09.918 --> 03:11.085
Completely untraceable.

03:11.418 --> 03:13.335
Well this is getting serious,
Vin.

03:18.126 --> 03:19.783
Alright who else has
the balls to race?

03:19.807 --> 03:20.859

03:21.543 --> 03:23.534
And I got 10 pounds
of the prompt cheatham (weed)

03:23.560 --> 03:25.134

03:27.626 --> 03:28.469
Alright...

03:28.495 --> 03:31.224
I guess this ain't going to be
no friendly race.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.725
I'm about to up the stake
big time.

03:35.585 --> 03:38.492
I'm bringing this bitch

03:39.168 --> 03:40.626

04:26.834 --> 04:28.250
I want to race.

04:28.793 --> 04:31.393
I got the pink slip to my car that says
I can take all of you.

04:31.625 --> 04:33.735
You think you can just strolled up and race

04:33.800 --> 04:34.834
Vin Serento?

04:42.709 --> 04:43.928
What are you driving?

04:43.954 --> 04:44.949
A car.

04:46.084 --> 04:47.310
With unicorns.

04:48.918 --> 04:50.918
Let's see what're you packing
under the hood.

04:56.326 --> 04:57.326
Whoa!

04:57.750 --> 04:59.543
He's got one of those big shiny things

04:59.610 --> 05:01.735
with a lot of tubes and curly curls
coming out of it .

05:01.826 --> 05:03.576
With a red doeken.

05:03.584 --> 05:06.250
Vin, he's got one of those fancy thing
in the jiggers.

05:08.250 --> 05:09.285
That's the real deal.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.934
But it's not the car you drive.

05:11.209 --> 05:14.634
It's the driver who's driving the car...
that's doing the driving.

05:15.259 --> 05:16.500
That's right

05:16.500 --> 05:18.000
Let him race.

05:21.418 --> 05:22.985
You heard my little sister.

05:23.009 --> 05:24.759
Let's see what you got.

05:47.293 --> 05:49.076
If you win, you get me.

05:50.043 --> 05:50.951
But..

05:51.076 --> 05:52.199
if you lose ...

05:52.209 --> 05:53.442
You get her.

06:01.750 --> 06:04.709
We've got a black guy in a white neighborhood,
minding his own business.

06:04.776 --> 06:06.079
All units respond.
Repeat.

06:06.105 --> 06:07.367
All units respond.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.334
We're good to go,
the cops are going to be busy for a while.

06:11.375 --> 06:13.134
Yo!
Start the race!

06:18.793 --> 06:20.000
Alright.

06:22.334 --> 06:23.384
Ready.

06:46.276 --> 06:47.475
Hey, white boy!

06:47.625 --> 06:48.834
You're grinding your gears.

06:49.043 --> 06:51.867
You have to stop accelerating
as you put it in the first.

06:54.875 --> 06:57.884
Thanks, I've never actually driven
a stick before.

07:03.125 --> 07:03.793
Go!

07:03.817 --> 07:05.016
Aww..!

07:06.540 --> 07:07.540
Oh!

07:14.250 --> 07:15.262
Damn it!

07:15.288 --> 07:17.117
Forgot to get gas!

08:08.959 --> 08:10.468
Hurry up.
I'm in a race.

08:11.709 --> 08:13.526
You're not getting a tip,
slowpoke.

08:58.875 --> 09:00.176
NITRO

09:01.460 --> 09:02.592
Feel the trills!

09:09.418 --> 09:11.250
If you win, you get me.

09:11.835 --> 09:13.375
But if you lose ...

09:13.710 --> 09:15.000
You get her.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.525
Oh, hell no!
I ain't going out like that!

09:35.918 --> 09:37.850
Too soon,
rookies.

09:58.085 --> 09:59.500
My turn to jeez up.

10:01.375 --> 10:02.668
(LANCE ARMSTRONG'S URINE)

10:09.092 --> 10:10.592
Whoa....!

10:13.918 --> 10:15.210
This is ...

10:18.210 --> 10:19.418
Awesome!

10:52.335 --> 10:53.625
My bad!

10:58.750 --> 11:00.350
I'm coming for you, Serento.

11:03.674 --> 11:04.741
Oh..

11:04.966 --> 11:06.499
Shit..

11:12.168 --> 11:13.201
I'm going to win.

11:13.625 --> 11:14.625
I'm going to win.

11:27.460 --> 11:28.692
Did I win?

11:44.085 --> 11:45.217
Smoked them!

11:52.960 --> 11:54.559
Alright guys,
pay up.

12:01.543 --> 12:03.085
Come here,
puppy.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.284
What you grinning about?

12:15.335 --> 12:17.585
I almost beat you.

12:18.418 --> 12:19.835
You almost beat me?

12:20.043 --> 12:22.618
You only can't beat me,
you can't even beat yourself.

12:23.125 --> 12:24.283
Not true Serento.

12:24.307 --> 12:26.549
I've beating myself
since junior high.

12:29.525 --> 12:30.576
No way.

12:30.668 --> 12:34.085
You wagered a 10 sec car,
you owe me a 10 sec car.

12:34.293 --> 12:35.868
Deliver to the shop tomorrow,

12:36.000 --> 12:37.034
Bitch!

12:39.250 --> 12:41.085
Polpol!
Roll out!

12:42.085 --> 12:43.115
Polpol?

12:43.139 --> 12:44.634
You know five-O.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.250
Pigs, bacon, barney.

12:47.275 --> 12:48.850
The heat, the law,
the fuzz, the man.

12:49.326 --> 12:50.309
No.

12:50.335 --> 12:52.210
The boys in blue.
The thin blue line.

12:52.835 --> 12:55.210
Johnny Law, Smokey,
Gunshoot, Flatfoot.

12:55.692 --> 12:56.230
Come on man?

12:56.254 --> 12:59.517
Haven't you ever seen an episode
of of CSI or NCIS or Illinois SBU.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.393
Are they on Netflix?

13:03.335 --> 13:04.684
I'm out of here!

13:07.250 --> 13:08.676
Damn,
it's the cops!

13:08.710 --> 13:10.750
Thanks for the heads up
bro!

13:14.125 --> 13:16.159
Where do you think you are going?
Cupcake.

13:20.085 --> 13:21.250
Take it easy.

13:24.625 --> 13:26.643
- Who were you racing with?
- Nobody.

13:26.710 --> 13:28.710
I was taking a romantic midnight drive.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.668
Oh, bullshit.

13:41.793 --> 13:44.000
Give me a name.
Was it Serento?

13:48.100 --> 13:49.100
Aw..

13:49.125 --> 13:50.143
Funny now?

13:56.393 --> 13:57.393
Aw..

13:57.418 --> 13:58.750
He's a kind of robot.

14:01.018 --> 14:03.018
Oh, yeah.
Alright.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.335
Ready?
Here we go!

14:10.250 --> 14:12.868
Come on, cupcake, you're done.
Let's go.

14:12.875 --> 14:14.301
Give me your hands.

14:19.668 --> 14:20.701
Come on.

14:20.701 --> 14:22.143
Hey!

14:22.168 --> 14:24.118
Jeez, Hanover,
you have to be so rough?

14:24.125 --> 14:26.659
I had to make it look real.
Serento might had been watching.

14:27.085 --> 14:29.725
Serento ever found out I'm was an undercover cop,
he would kill me.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.556
Don't worry. I
erased your files.

14:31.581 --> 14:33.792
No one on the force even
knows you're a cop.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.710
Your secret dies with me.

14:36.210 --> 14:38.298
It's just. Maybe I'm not
the right guy for the job.

14:38.322 --> 14:39.966
I mean.
I don't exactly fit in.

14:40.085 --> 14:42.335
- I'm really white.
- You'll be fine.

14:42.543 --> 14:45.663
I'm so white that when i went to
an all white boarding school.

14:45.688 --> 14:47.125
Nicknamed was "Cracker".

14:47.418 --> 14:49.460
- I get it.
- No, I don't think you do!

14:49.750 --> 14:50.875
I love hockey.

14:51.210 --> 14:54.418
I water ski,
I have a favorite lacrosse team.

14:54.668 --> 14:56.710
I have a crush on Martha Stewart.

14:56.918 --> 14:59.835
People mistake me
for the WikiLeak's guy.

14:59.959 --> 15:00.841
Okay.

15:01.043 --> 15:03.000
I still buy Kid Rock albums.

15:03.918 --> 15:07.543
I put purplery sachets
in my underwear drawer.

15:07.750 --> 15:08.793
I wear Crocs.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.850
I take a weekly Zumba class.

15:13.085 --> 15:14.500
Oh,
for Christ sake.

15:14.875 --> 15:17.875
I cried.
When 'Friends' went off the air.

15:18.085 --> 15:21.250
My favourite actress of all time,
is Kristen Stewart,

15:21.460 --> 15:24.375
And my favourite movie off all time,
is Pitch Perfect.

15:36.125 --> 15:37.393
Oh, dear God!

15:38.625 --> 15:40.629
I'm so white,
that I put mayonnaise on sticks,

15:40.630 --> 15:42.659
and freeze them to
make mayonnaise sickles.

15:45.625 --> 15:48.643
You have no family,
you got no friends.

15:49.168 --> 15:50.918
You score through the roof

15:51.375 --> 15:53.201
on the criminal aptitude test.

15:53.201 --> 15:53.933
Take a look.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.460
Score higher than Charles Manson.

15:55.918 --> 15:56.918
Dexter.

15:57.375 --> 15:59.625
You score higher than Kanye.

16:00.668 --> 16:04.210
It's a fine line, which side
of the law you even belong.

16:04.418 --> 16:07.250
That makes you perfect for undercover work .

16:08.210 --> 16:10.125
Or being a journalist for TMZ.

16:13.210 --> 16:13.918
I guess so.

16:14.125 --> 16:17.460
Now look, Serento and his crew
are responsible for everything.

16:17.875 --> 16:21.467
From truck heist to counterfeiting
 Bed Bath & Beyond gift cards.

16:22.668 --> 16:24.168
There is something big going down.

16:24.335 --> 16:26.842
We think that they might be working
for this man.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.225
J.Lo's ex-hubby, Marc Anthony?

16:30.850 --> 16:31.750
No!

16:31.750 --> 16:35.534
That's Juan Carlos De La Sol,
the criminal king pin of LA (Los Angeles).

16:36.835 --> 16:37.772
Right ...

16:38.273 --> 16:39.418
Now look.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.500
Tonight you got closest to Serento
than anyone ever has.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.210
But I need you to get closer still.

16:44.543 --> 16:46.418
I need you to join their crew.

16:46.625 --> 16:49.168
So we can get the evidence
that we need to take these guys down.

16:50.168 --> 16:52.793
Are you with me?

16:55.125 --> 16:56.000
That's my boy.

16:56.335 --> 16:59.585
But, how do I explain to Serento
why you release me?

16:59.793 --> 17:01.543
Just tell him you beat my up and ran away.

17:02.043 --> 17:04.393
- You think he'll go for that?
- Yeah, if it looks right.

17:04.666 --> 17:05.416
What do you mean?

17:06.541 --> 17:07.250
Hit me.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.710
- Come again?
- Look, we got to make it look real.

17:11.041 --> 17:12.362
Like we really got into a brawl.

17:12.363 --> 17:14.875
And you knuckles got to look
 you had been hitting somebody.

17:15.085 --> 17:15.835
So, hit me.

17:19.291 --> 17:20.345
Oh, I can,t.

17:20.346 --> 17:22.750
I mean , can't we just like.. puts some fake blood
on my knuckles or something.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.085
Serento's a streetwise thug,
he's going to see right through that..

17:26.291 --> 17:27.960
Now hit me!

17:30.651 --> 17:33.026
Oh..
That hurts!

17:33.335 --> 17:35.125
I never actually hit someone before!

17:35.292 --> 17:37.335
Now do it again, and harder.

17:40.335 --> 17:41.343
Harder.

17:43.667 --> 17:44.960
Harder!

17:53.375 --> 17:55.292
Oh shit, I'm sorry.
Your lips bleeding.

17:55.667 --> 17:58.285
It's nothing.
Okay, my turn.

17:59.335 --> 18:00.884
What do you mean,
my turn?

18:00.960 --> 18:03.026
Serento will never believe
that you beat a hard detective,

18:03.027 --> 18:05.009
without taking a few beats yourself.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.875
I guess so but ...

18:07.800 --> 18:08.800
Hey ?

18:12.183 --> 18:13.183
You alright?

18:13.210 --> 18:15.393
You good?
Yeah, you alright.

18:23.792 --> 18:25.042
(NO TRESPASSING)

18:35.067 --> 18:36.067
Hey.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.660
You got my car 10 second car?

18:51.710 --> 18:52.992
As promised.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.460
Come on ...

19:00.460 --> 19:01.934
- This thing is tiny!
- Exactly.

19:03.460 --> 19:05.875
With it's light body and a beef engine,
this could be ...

19:06.085 --> 19:08.000
The fastest car in the circuit.

19:09.125 --> 19:11.460
But Vin,
it's all busted up.

19:11.960 --> 19:12.960
It's a ton of work.

19:13.292 --> 19:14.625
Then fix it up!

19:15.960 --> 19:17.292
And you're going to help him.

19:18.085 --> 19:20.460
- Cos now you work for me.
- What?

19:24.625 --> 19:26.542
We have a full medical and dental plans.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.542
We recognized same sex partnership
for health benefits.

19:31.667 --> 19:33.834
And last but not least ...

19:33.835 --> 19:35.250
Casual Fridays.

19:35.792 --> 19:39.085
That's when I get to wear
my dope ass Hawaiian shirts.

19:39.250 --> 19:40.960
Deal with it,
bitch!

19:43.000 --> 19:44.085
Alright, Vin.

19:46.460 --> 19:47.910
Where can I put my stuff?

19:49.292 --> 19:50.417
Over there.

20:04.233 --> 20:05.233
Whoa.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.667
A lot of stolen merchandise .

20:07.835 --> 20:09.367
Whoa..
(A LOT OF STOLEN MERCHANDISE)

20:11.750 --> 20:12.984
Son of a bitch!

20:19.042 --> 20:20.542
Come on, drink it!

20:20.750 --> 20:22.484
Drink it,
you son of a bitch!

20:23.500 --> 20:24.567
What are you doing!

20:26.085 --> 20:27.625
You're going to kill him!

20:28.500 --> 20:30.292
You know how fattening this stuff is!
(SUNDAE SYRUP)

20:30.710 --> 20:31.768
He's a cop!

20:31.835 --> 20:34.259
- I saw him snooping around.
- I ain't not cop!

20:34.335 --> 20:35.542
You're wearing a wire!

20:38.433 --> 20:39.433
Aww..

20:39.460 --> 20:40.710
I hate cops.

20:44.085 --> 20:46.250
I saw him get arrested last night.

20:46.625 --> 20:49.125
They beat him down trying
to get him to give me up.

20:49.292 --> 20:50.710
And he never dropped a dime.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.042
- Vin!
- I live by my instincts.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.710
And he's as much as a cop

20:54.917 --> 20:58.250
as my girlfriend is in the class
about her true sexual identity.

21:01.125 --> 21:02.050
I can't believe this ...

21:02.051 --> 21:04.509
Why don't he go out with your
sister while he's at it.

21:04.542 --> 21:05.818
Pick you up at 7?

21:05.819 --> 21:07.192
It's a date.

21:08.042 --> 21:09.500
Oh, come on!

21:22.210 --> 21:23.442
Nice.

21:35.859 --> 21:36.917
Nervous?

21:36.919 --> 21:37.817
No.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.951
I am,
I'll admit it.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.585
- You are?
- Sure.

21:43.292 --> 21:44.835
I'm not so good at this.

21:45.042 --> 21:45.981
The whole time we're out.

21:45.982 --> 21:48.817
I'm going to be thinking about when
is the right moment to kiss you.

21:48.875 --> 21:49.942
Really?

21:49.960 --> 21:52.643
I propose that we just do it now,
and get it out of the way.

21:53.625 --> 21:54.867
Do the first kiss now?

21:54.868 --> 21:56.184
What do you say?

21:57.667 --> 21:58.701
Alright.

22:11.167 --> 22:13.660
- I feel better already.
- Me too.

22:21.210 --> 22:23.476
So. What do you have planned
for our date.

22:23.792 --> 22:25.042
I was thinking a little dinner.

22:25.542 --> 22:27.085
Sounds great.

22:29.335 --> 22:31.925
Fondue?
How romantic.

22:34.625 --> 22:36.826
- May I ?
- Please.

22:46.085 --> 22:47.152
Sorry.

22:47.252 --> 22:49.218
Awkward first date moment.

22:49.542 --> 22:50.742
Yeah.

22:53.792 --> 22:55.500
So tell me about your brother.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.489
What do you want to know ?

22:58.490 --> 22:59.792
I do not know.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.851
How does Vin have the money
to pay for all those

23:01.917 --> 23:03.585
suit up cars?

23:04.050 --> 23:06.143
Does he engage in illegal activities.

23:06.367 --> 23:09.059
on regular..
basis?

23:09.335 --> 23:10.585
What is he planning to do

23:10.750 --> 23:12.167
with LA king pin

23:12.667 --> 23:14.492
Juan Carlos De La Sol?

23:15.835 --> 23:18.434
- I don't want to talk about my brother.
- Right.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.960
- Let's talk about you.
- What about me?

23:24.292 --> 23:27.550
What are you there?
You're not a tough girl.

23:28.085 --> 23:31.750
Sure, on the outside.
You have this take no shit hard exterior.

23:31.960 --> 23:33.667
But,
on the inside..

23:34.542 --> 23:36.085
You're completely different.

23:36.292 --> 23:37.384
I am?

23:38.542 --> 23:41.800
Your ideal night,
is cuddling up with your snuggie.

23:41.875 --> 23:43.417
Watching your favorite movies.

23:43.585 --> 23:47.175
The Notebook, Dear John
and The Human Centipede.

23:48.085 --> 23:51.500
You donate all of your extra money,
to the causes closest to your heart.

23:51.917 --> 23:54.792
Save The Whales
Amnesty International,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
No Child Left Behind Without
an Xbox.

23:57.542 --> 24:00.625
And on New Year's eve,
when the clock strikes midnight,

24:00.917 --> 24:03.042
Just as Ryan Seacrest
ushers in the new year.

24:03.792 --> 24:05.125
When the big ball thingy.

24:05.542 --> 24:06.792
lowers on that..

24:08.585 --> 24:09.634
thing.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.617
You make a wish that the new year

24:11.785 --> 24:13.300
will bring you,
the true love.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.750
Flat tire.

25:13.710 --> 25:16.050
Jordana told me what went down
on your date last night.

25:16.125 --> 25:18.750
About the fondue
and flat tire?

25:19.042 --> 25:20.292
About the..

25:22.085 --> 25:24.542
relationships,
You had at the back of her apartment.

25:24.960 --> 25:28.367
Sorry, Vin.
it won't happen again.

25:28.667 --> 25:29.875
It better happen again.

25:31.042 --> 25:33.285
I've never seen my sister
so happy before.

25:33.460 --> 25:34.960
She's glowing.

25:49.659 --> 25:50.659
Yeah.

25:51.085 --> 25:52.093
I got it.

25:52.375 --> 25:53.835
I'll be right there.

25:55.917 --> 25:57.375
Michelle, let's bounce.

25:57.401 --> 25:58.601
Vin.

26:00.085 --> 26:02.785
Vin, baby.
You know I got softball every Tuesday!

26:06.210 --> 26:07.593
You're ready to take your shot?

26:07.960 --> 26:10.417
- Where are we going?
- Don't ask so many questions.

26:11.585 --> 26:12.835
Why?

26:14.917 --> 26:16.367
That's another question.

26:18.250 --> 26:19.476
Why so curious?

26:20.417 --> 26:24.000
So, if I knew where we were going,
I would know how to dress.

26:24.210 --> 26:26.125
Fancy, casual ...

26:27.085 --> 26:28.101
nautical.

26:28.808 --> 26:30.808
Whoa.
Hey, hey!

26:30.835 --> 26:32.835
You taking him over me?

26:35.417 --> 26:37.026
Thought we were BFFs.

26:40.167 --> 26:41.460
Fine.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.695
You can forget about
coming over tonight and

26:43.697 --> 26:45.843
watch the season finale
of the Bachelor.

26:45.851 --> 26:47.384
Cos you are no longer invited!

26:50.792 --> 26:52.067
Let's go.

26:58.125 --> 27:02.710
"Heading out. Something big
going down with De La Sol."

27:03.167 --> 27:05.125
HANOVER:
"Will monitor your activities..."

27:47.000 --> 27:49.375
On behalf of Juan Carlos De La Sol,

27:49.917 --> 27:51.300
Thank you for coming.

27:51.500 --> 27:55.042
You are here
because you are the best in the city.

27:56.042 --> 27:58.125
But alas,
we only need one driver.

27:58.585 --> 27:59.351
This is bullshit!

27:59.417 --> 28:00.585
To get the job...

28:01.875 --> 28:03.667
you are going to have to audition.

28:04.460 --> 28:08.326
We'll see who is the best
of the best.

28:09.351 --> 28:10.550
Oh, yes.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.710
I think you know what you got to do

28:13.000 --> 28:14.960
to impress De La Sol.

28:15.167 --> 28:17.585
And to show you have the cojones (balls)..

28:17.792 --> 28:19.375
to work for him.

28:21.250 --> 28:22.542
Vin.
What's going on?

28:22.710 --> 28:24.009
Just follow my lead.

29:06.042 --> 29:07.585
Freestyle.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.460
Oh yes, yes.
Come on twerk!

29:32.750 --> 29:34.192
Twerk like Miley Cyrus!

29:36.718 --> 29:37.718
Yes.

29:41.242 --> 29:42.242
Yes.

29:48.335 --> 29:49.585
Diego!

30:15.710 --> 30:18.085
Man, I had you.
I totally out danced you.

30:18.292 --> 30:21.042
You never out dance me.
Who're you kidding?

30:21.250 --> 30:22.917
3 years dance repertory.

30:23.125 --> 30:26.410
Ballet, modern,
contemporary and even tap.

30:30.125 --> 30:32.250
Right then,
but next time ...

30:34.085 --> 30:35.542
Next time.

30:44.750 --> 30:46.417
- Nice moves.
- Thanks.

30:46.875 --> 30:48.242
I only need one driver.

30:48.585 --> 30:50.359
But you guys had ball so good.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.701
I decided I'm going to hire
the two of you.

30:56.625 --> 30:58.710
- What's the job?
- Very simple.

31:05.710 --> 31:08.800
You must drive my super car
to this location.

31:10.710 --> 31:14.201
Upon delivery,
you will be paid $ 100,000.

31:14.625 --> 31:16.210
- Super car?
- Yeah.

31:17.667 --> 31:20.167
- She's a tiger.
- I know.

31:20.375 --> 31:22.109
It's the only one of it's kind.

31:22.634 --> 31:23.709
It's priceless.

31:23.710 --> 31:25.526
You got yourself a deal.

31:25.542 --> 31:27.634
- Question.
- Here we go again.

31:27.667 --> 31:28.835
Excuse me?

31:28.835 --> 31:30.710
Why don't you just drive the car yourself?

31:31.667 --> 31:35.460
I would. But I have
a million unpaid parking tickets.

31:35.667 --> 31:37.167
So they raise my insurance premium.

31:38.335 --> 31:41.167
Besides that, the car is a
like a cop magnet. You know.

31:41.375 --> 31:44.460
You tried Geico?
15 minutes can save you 15%.

31:44.625 --> 31:48.792
Yes. And half like it even Progressive,
but it's still a little worth to have.

31:50.667 --> 31:52.067
Are you a college graduate?

31:53.125 --> 31:54.492
Cos if you are a college grad,

31:54.559 --> 31:57.143
she could be eligible for a
pretty substantial discount.

31:57.250 --> 31:58.550
I once took a French league class

31:58.551 --> 32:00.009
in the college, does that count?

32:00.042 --> 32:00.835
Did you pass?

32:01.085 --> 32:04.292
No, the professor flunked me.
So I shot him.

32:04.875 --> 32:08.035
Look I rather just pay criminals
like yourself to drive the super car.

32:08.250 --> 32:10.701
Whenever I have to move it's location,
okay?

32:11.500 --> 32:14.460
- Make sense to me.
- But the math doesn't add up!

32:14.960 --> 32:18.460
You are offering us $ 100,000
in a down economy.

32:18.667 --> 32:20.960
What was your best bid from Aflac?

32:21.167 --> 32:24.401
Look! Do you want the job or not?
God damn it!

32:25.542 --> 32:27.667
Yes, he does.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.585
- Let's go.
- Get the fuck in the car!

32:38.542 --> 32:41.460
It's not working.
Dumb car must be broken.

32:46.085 --> 32:48.460
- Your foot is on the brake.
- What?

32:54.000 --> 32:55.292
Oh right ...

33:38.250 --> 33:39.835
I got a bad feeling about this.

33:42.085 --> 33:43.292
Why?

33:44.375 --> 33:45.460
Listen to the score.

33:51.292 --> 33:52.585
Dissonant chord progression.

33:58.335 --> 34:00.101
Heavy use of Strings.

34:02.585 --> 34:03.742
Oboe.

34:06.542 --> 34:08.251
It all seems quite ominous.

34:23.001 --> 34:24.335
You got the money?

34:28.043 --> 34:29.300
There you go, sir.

34:34.835 --> 34:36.793
Count it.
Make sure it's all there.

34:37.001 --> 34:39.217
Nah.
This guy seems alright to me.

34:40.842 --> 34:42.043
Oh, oh.

34:45.168 --> 34:47.117
- I got it!
- Throw it, you idiot!

34:48.335 --> 34:49.451
Not to me!

34:50.876 --> 34:52.376
I don't want it!

34:52.585 --> 34:54.076
What you waiting for, Vin.
Throw it!

34:54.460 --> 34:57.085
Nah. I'm going to time it just right.
So when I throw it.

34:57.335 --> 34:58.409
They will catch it.

34:58.460 --> 35:00.659
and it will explode before they have
a chance to throw it back.

35:02.585 --> 35:03.885
Good thinking, right?

35:05.135 --> 35:06.081
Get ready!

35:06.081 --> 35:07.217
Wait for it.

35:07.217 --> 35:08.271
One.

35:10.072 --> 35:11.083
Two.

35:12.809 --> 35:14.009
And three.

35:17.293 --> 35:18.460
You okay?

35:26.126 --> 35:27.592
I think we got double crossed.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.576
Oh, you think so?

35:53.085 --> 35:54.326
Where're you going?

36:14.876 --> 36:16.543
Oh, shit!

36:16.768 --> 36:17.967
No!

36:20.092 --> 36:21.293
Oh, shit..

36:24.925 --> 36:27.568
Serento ever found out I was an undercover cop,
he would kill me.

36:27.635 --> 36:29.101
Dont worry.
I erased your file.

36:29.126 --> 36:31.750
I'm the only one in the force
who knows that you're a cop.

36:31.751 --> 36:33.559
Your secret dies with me.

36:35.251 --> 36:36.751
Oh, shit!

36:46.376 --> 36:47.909
Come on,
you bastard!

36:50.126 --> 36:51.518
Take it easy.

36:53.168 --> 36:54.460
He's dead.

36:58.585 --> 37:00.268
You're a cop killer now.

37:02.460 --> 37:04.085
High five.

37:06.543 --> 37:08.460
Let's go,
come on.

37:08.668 --> 37:09.751
Let's go!

37:50.710 --> 37:51.918
(BABY OIL)

38:07.510 --> 38:08.951
He killed a cop.

38:09.043 --> 38:10.260
Son of a bitch!

38:11.076 --> 38:13.076
Detective Johnson,
I got some files for you to look at ...

38:13.085 --> 38:14.693
This is no time for paper work.

38:18.050 --> 38:20.217
I got regular, decaf,
latte ...

38:20.467 --> 38:22.543
I'll drink some coffee when
I solved this crime.

38:24.793 --> 38:26.617
Here are the urine samples
you requested.

38:28.293 --> 38:29.376
Oh smell this!

38:29.543 --> 38:30.583
Look.

38:30.585 --> 38:31.617
People.

38:31.626 --> 38:34.400
The only thing I want right now is
to know what happened here.

38:36.293 --> 38:37.710
Officer Canaro,
what have you got?

38:40.210 --> 38:41.951
There is a camera.

38:43.376 --> 38:44.650
Yeah.
So?

38:44.751 --> 38:45.751
So.

38:46.668 --> 38:49.184
Maybe, it recorded what happened.

38:49.251 --> 38:49.960
And then what?

38:51.043 --> 38:52.251
And then..

38:56.126 --> 38:59.001
And then
you could watch the tape.

38:59.168 --> 39:01.168
And see..
who shot him.

39:05.876 --> 39:07.210
It just might worked.

39:16.001 --> 39:17.460
(Come on, you bastard!)

39:17.835 --> 39:19.085
Who is he?

39:20.251 --> 39:21.007
Initiating Facial Recognition

39:21.108 --> 39:21.768
- NO MATCH-

39:22.085 --> 39:23.311
There's nothing on him.

39:23.313 --> 39:24.492
No record.

39:25.460 --> 39:27.668
Guy kills a cop,
has no priors ...

39:28.543 --> 39:30.326
Doesn't make any sense.

39:32.293 --> 39:34.226
Let's check the body,
I want a fingerprint.

39:35.175 --> 39:36.425
What the hell is that?

39:36.460 --> 39:38.826
The black light will expose
what the human eye can't see.

39:39.001 --> 39:41.034
Like what date line uses,
for those exposes

39:41.101 --> 39:44.085
or Motels with dirty sheets.
covering disgusting bed bugs.

39:53.210 --> 39:54.242
Got cha.

39:54.244 --> 39:55.675
You, son of a bitch.

40:01.251 --> 40:02.284
What?

40:02.543 --> 40:04.376
Nothing.
Nothing.

40:23.335 --> 40:24.425
Where is my car?

40:24.451 --> 40:25.650
Well, Carlos.

40:26.543 --> 40:29.550
I don't mean to be the bearer
of bad news, but..

40:30.793 --> 40:31.918
I don't have it.

40:32.460 --> 40:34.159
So.
You don't have my car?

40:35.085 --> 40:36.143
Well uh ...

40:36.751 --> 40:38.800
The double cross didn't go as planned,
per se.

40:38.835 --> 40:40.101
Per se?

40:40.960 --> 40:43.760
Yeah, per se. You know.
As a matter of speaking.

40:43.835 --> 40:47.650
Yeah, but you say per se,
when what you said wasn't exactly accurate.

40:47.876 --> 40:49.168
So what happened?

40:50.001 --> 40:51.751
The double cross didn't go as planned.

40:51.918 --> 40:53.510
So, Not per se after all.

40:55.793 --> 40:58.126
I guess not.
Not per se.

40:59.876 --> 41:00.768
And that!

41:00.835 --> 41:01.918
That!

41:02.626 --> 41:03.876
Per se!

41:06.001 --> 41:08.617
I have more information.
Senor.

41:08.710 --> 41:11.284
I was going to tell you,
but you stabbed me.

41:11.876 --> 41:14.335
Yeah well,
you must always kill the messenger.

41:14.585 --> 41:16.900
That's sort of how we work,
 right?

41:17.117 --> 41:19.576
Si, si.
I understand, but ...

41:21.701 --> 41:22.701
Quick.

41:23.126 --> 41:24.626
Make him comfortable.

41:24.918 --> 41:27.293
Bring a pillow
and some coconut water.

41:28.818 --> 41:29.818
Here

41:35.210 --> 41:37.335
- Bless you.
- This pillow is down filled!

41:37.876 --> 41:39.001
I'm allergic!

41:39.135 --> 41:41.460
You have a hypoallergenic one?

41:41.467 --> 41:44.534
I don't know.
Perhaps cotton or I don't know..

41:44.543 --> 41:47.001
Something in the soft, microfiber.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.168
Thank you.

41:55.693 --> 41:57.125
There, feel better now.

41:57.126 --> 41:59.210
It will help to replenish your electrolytes.

42:00.210 --> 42:02.293
It's filled with mango and peach.

42:03.085 --> 42:04.166
Feel better now?

42:04.166 --> 42:05.867
Oh, Serento.

42:06.501 --> 42:08.293
He shot the other three.

42:08.501 --> 42:10.043
I barely got out with my life...

42:13.668 --> 42:15.001
Serento, huh.

42:16.835 --> 42:18.251
Get rid of him.

42:19.460 --> 42:20.103
Carlos ...

42:20.105 --> 42:22.376
Madre de Dios, que me asustó !
(Mother of God, you scared me!)

42:22.460 --> 42:24.043
I wasn't done.

42:25.085 --> 42:28.251
Forgive me please.
I constantly interrupt people.

42:28.460 --> 42:31.751
It's a terrible habit,
I'm working on it.

42:32.376 --> 42:35.476
But my therapist says
it's a form of narcissism.

42:36.543 --> 42:37.434
Anyway,
you were saying?

42:37.501 --> 42:40.034
I know where Serento
and his crew hideout.

42:41.626 --> 42:43.217
It's at the warehouse of...

42:44.960 --> 42:46.588
I interrupt again,
didn't I?

42:46.588 --> 42:47.376
Yeah.

42:48.085 --> 42:50.501
Therapy is a process.

42:51.585 --> 42:53.210
Get my car.

42:53.418 --> 42:55.626
As for Serento and his crew.

42:56.460 --> 42:57.893
kill them all.

42:58.585 --> 43:01.085
I have more information, senor.

43:17.918 --> 43:21.001
(- WE'RE CLOSED -
definitely not hiding out inside! )

43:22.335 --> 43:24.668
Alright people. We are in serious
lock down mode.

43:24.876 --> 43:26.085
No one leaves the garage.

43:26.293 --> 43:28.543
De La Sol is out to kill me,
and the rest of you.

43:30.210 --> 43:31.668
How can you be so sure?

43:31.710 --> 43:33.050
By follow my Tweeter.

43:33.117 --> 43:34.360
(You're all #dead!)

43:37.168 --> 43:39.835
( New episode of #DuckDynasty tonight,
can't wait .)

43:41.335 --> 43:42.418
Check this out.

43:43.126 --> 43:44.492
A Tragedy has occurred.

43:44.518 --> 43:47.717
Where a veteran detective
has been brutally murdered.

43:53.501 --> 43:55.293
Come on,
you bastard!

43:55.534 --> 43:58.284
Police had been ordered
to shoot this man.

43:58.351 --> 44:00.710
Police are also encouraging
Angelenos to take the law

44:00.717 --> 44:02.235
into their own hands.

44:02.501 --> 44:05.418
If you see this man,
please shoot him, stab him,

44:05.485 --> 44:09.018
or if the opportunity arises,
slap him upside the head.

44:09.793 --> 44:11.309
Oh,
come on!

44:12.168 --> 44:13.235
What?

44:15.751 --> 44:17.668
- We have to get out of here.
- Go where?

44:17.876 --> 44:19.492
Some place where no one would find us.

44:20.210 --> 44:22.835
Some place with no extradition,

44:22.842 --> 44:24.510
like Tokyo or Rio

44:24.918 --> 44:25.918
or Florida.

44:26.251 --> 44:28.793
You are talking fake passports,
plane tickets,

44:28.960 --> 44:30.043
living off the grid ...

44:30.251 --> 44:31.534
We dont have that kind of money,
Vin.

44:31.543 --> 44:33.826
Then we need to get some money,
fast.

44:35.418 --> 44:37.043
Or we're all dead.

44:37.251 --> 44:38.543
Ideas?

44:42.710 --> 44:47.376
How about we moved to San Francisco
and open an alternative lesbians coffee shop.

44:49.376 --> 44:51.485
What?
I'm just big ballin.

44:54.251 --> 44:56.418
Why don't we just sell this bitch
super car.

44:56.425 --> 44:57.543
We'll be rich!

44:57.568 --> 44:58.967
Boom!

44:59.668 --> 45:01.626
Problem solved, bitch!

45:01.960 --> 45:05.268
Great idea,
if it were actually a "super car".

45:05.335 --> 45:06.467
What?

45:14.043 --> 45:15.534
87 octane?

45:16.335 --> 45:17.960
Super cars only run on premium.

45:18.210 --> 45:19.409
I know it .

45:19.626 --> 45:23.001
Why would De La Sol have us drive this car
unless it was valuable.

45:23.710 --> 45:25.251
Something smells fishy.

45:32.418 --> 45:33.710
(DE LA SOL ILLEGAL ACTIVITY)

45:33.918 --> 45:36.793
(BRIBES TO POLITICIANS,
 MY HOUSE OF HOES,
 I HAVE $100M INA VAULT)

45:37.460 --> 45:40.010
It's a break down of all De La Sol's
illegal activity.

45:40.043 --> 45:42.425
Records of bribes to corrupt politicians,

45:42.492 --> 45:44.034
where he houses his hoes,

45:44.101 --> 45:46.268
Where he keeps his stash of money
worth over a $100 million.

45:46.335 --> 45:48.626
Wait ...
That's it!

45:48.793 --> 45:49.809
Right!

45:49.876 --> 45:52.668
We go to the house where he keeps his hoes
and we keep it.

46:00.918 --> 46:02.668
We steal his $100 million.

46:03.085 --> 46:04.818
and get out of town for good.

46:05.918 --> 46:07.293
Who's in?

46:21.793 --> 46:22.867
I'm in.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.376
Boss, I got the lunch.

46:38.793 --> 46:40.925
Thank God,
I'm starving.

46:41.251 --> 46:42.543
What is this?

46:45.293 --> 46:46.349
Burger and fries.

46:46.349 --> 46:48.309
Yeah I can see that.
I'm not blind!

46:48.418 --> 46:50.518
But I ordered a kid's meal.

46:50.585 --> 46:51.451
I'm sorry.

46:51.460 --> 46:52.893
You know that I've been collecting

46:52.960 --> 46:55.360
the 'Despicable Me' minions.

46:55.668 --> 46:57.300
- I told you. You know that.
- Yes

46:57.460 --> 46:59.976
I have them all,
except for Carl.

47:00.543 --> 47:02.210
I have Jerry,
I have Stuart,

47:02.376 --> 47:04.126
I have Kevin, Dave,

47:04.335 --> 47:06.418
but I needed Carl.

47:06.876 --> 47:07.835
Carl says

47:08.001 --> 47:11.826
"Bee-doh! Bee-doh."

47:12.168 --> 47:13.835
And you forget about it.

47:14.043 --> 47:16.710
I need the BeeDoh BeeDoh guy,
to complete my collection!

47:16.876 --> 47:18.376
Okay, I go back.
I go get a new one.

47:18.543 --> 47:19.534
No, no, no..

47:19.543 --> 47:21.418
I don't even want it anymore.

47:23.835 --> 47:26.434
Robbing Juan Carlos' of a $100 million,
ain't going to be easy.

47:26.501 --> 47:29.784
If we are going to pull off this heist,
we're going to need a bigger crew.

47:29.876 --> 47:32.568
First thing first,
we need a black guy.

47:33.168 --> 47:36.717
As Ja Rule or Bow Wow
or Ludacris.

47:36.751 --> 47:38.418
Why does he have to be a rapper?

47:38.751 --> 47:41.659
Cos movies like these always have a rapper
doing the cameo.

47:42.793 --> 47:44.467
It brings in the urban demographic.

47:44.585 --> 47:45.793
Dummy.

47:46.001 --> 47:47.885
Plus, they get to do a soundtrack title.

47:48.876 --> 47:52.751
Hey, what about uh ..
Lil Wayne, T.I., DMX,

47:53.210 --> 47:54.534
Gucci Mane and Akon?

47:54.543 --> 47:58.117
No, all those guys are either on their way to jail
or just getting out of jail.

47:58.210 --> 48:00.726
We'll film a reality show that
chronicles going to jail

48:00.793 --> 48:02.385
and then getting out of jail.

48:04.293 --> 48:05.943
And then go back to jail.

48:05.943 --> 48:07.067
I got it.

48:07.092 --> 48:09.967
I know the perfect guy to do the cameo.

48:12.460 --> 48:14.668
RAPPER
CAMEO

48:15.043 --> 48:16.659
And we need an Asian guy.

48:19.626 --> 48:22.960
- Some one who can drift?
- Because Asian guys are cool.

48:23.251 --> 48:25.501
COOL ASIAN GUY

48:25.918 --> 48:27.831
And last but not least,
we need a beautiful model

48:27.831 --> 48:29.826
making her future acting debut..

48:50.501 --> 48:53.085
She's not going to have a lot of lines
or a lot to do.

48:54.001 --> 48:57.010
But she's smoking hot.
Fine to look at.

48:57.101 --> 48:58.851
MODEL TURNED ACTRESS

48:59.085 --> 49:00.867
- How do you do that?
- What?

49:00.876 --> 49:03.367
You describe them and then like
instantly they're here.

49:03.460 --> 49:04.592
Well, I had to.

49:04.626 --> 49:07.159
It's a classic multi-ethnic
round up scene.

49:07.168 --> 49:09.284
It's in every
Fast & Furious movie.

49:09.293 --> 49:14.050
Plus, I like to give my heist a sort of
United Colors of Benetton feel.

49:14.251 --> 49:15.951
Now let's get down to business.

49:26.701 --> 49:28.701
Alright, these are the blueprints to the building

49:28.768 --> 49:30.976
De La Sol is holding his $100 million in.

49:31.335 --> 49:33.784
Does anyone
have any idea.

49:34.668 --> 49:36.110
How to read a blueprint?

49:37.309 --> 49:39.010
Oh, damn dog of my.

49:39.335 --> 49:40.992
That's not what you asked me.

49:41.001 --> 49:44.110
You said, can I drive fast
and can I use a gun.

49:46.126 --> 49:48.085
- Damn!
- So many numbers.

49:48.293 --> 49:50.394
Right, then i say
we go over there

49:50.420 --> 49:52.724
and see for ourselves
what we are up against.

49:54.710 --> 49:57.300
You, Rapper Cameo and
Cool Asian Guy.

49:57.710 --> 49:58.960
Let's roll.

50:00.585 --> 50:02.092
Wait!
I'm not going?

50:02.126 --> 50:04.876
No, why don't you stay behind
with the girls.

50:05.960 --> 50:07.193
Killed him.

50:16.001 --> 50:17.800
That was our secret handshake!

50:18.043 --> 50:20.585
- Now it's his.
- Deal with it.

50:21.168 --> 50:22.251
Bitch!

50:32.150 --> 50:34.717
There's something I need to talk to you
about when you get back.

50:34.751 --> 50:36.510
Can you give me a hint?

50:45.376 --> 50:48.043
Rock-a-bye baby

50:48.210 --> 50:50.418
 on the treetop.

50:50.485 --> 50:54.601
When the wind blows,
the cradle will rock.

50:55.925 --> 50:57.425
Okay...

50:59.251 --> 51:02.034
When the bough breaks,
the cradle will fall.

51:02.043 --> 51:04.710
And down will come
BABY...

51:04.775 --> 51:06.476
cradle and all.

51:07.335 --> 51:08.460
Oh my God!

51:09.001 --> 51:10.626
Are you serious?

51:13.751 --> 51:15.543
You taken up singing.

51:15.751 --> 51:18.068
You should totally try out
for The Voice.

51:18.085 --> 51:21.342
Avril Lavigne is going to love you!

51:22.293 --> 51:25.376
When a man and a woman
make love,

51:25.585 --> 51:28.668
sometimes there can be,
unintended

51:28.835 --> 51:30.210
consequences.

51:30.418 --> 51:32.335
I know exactly
where this is heading.

51:32.342 --> 51:34.135
And I want to talk to you about it.

51:34.501 --> 51:35.429
Great.

51:35.454 --> 51:37.742
Cos I'm pretty sure
you gave me herpes.

51:41.666 --> 51:42.666
I'm...

51:44.085 --> 51:45.876
We'll talk about this later.

52:33.085 --> 52:34.168
Who are you?

52:49.126 --> 52:50.659
Where is the rest
of the money?

52:50.668 --> 52:52.976
What do you mean?
It's all here.

52:56.318 --> 52:57.163
Watch out!

52:57.188 --> 52:58.742
I'm on it, bro.

53:08.867 --> 53:11.501
De La Sol's stash is worth
over a $100 million.

53:11.668 --> 53:12.860
Where is it?

53:12.918 --> 53:15.409
- Who's De La Sol?
- Who's De La Sol.

53:15.934 --> 53:17.134
Aw...

53:17.418 --> 53:18.992
You think I was born yesterday?

53:21.376 --> 53:22.451
Question.

53:23.501 --> 53:25.576
Is this 1414 Becker Street?

53:25.793 --> 53:27.219
This is 1414

53:27.744 --> 53:29.224
Becker Lane.

53:29.335 --> 53:30.550
What's with all the cash?

53:30.710 --> 53:33.818
We're a church,
it was Bingo night.

53:35.501 --> 53:37.626
I am the pastor,
you asshole!

53:41.585 --> 53:42.925
(CHURCH COMMUNITY CENTER)

53:58.150 --> 53:59.451
Que paso?
(What happen?)

54:00.876 --> 54:03.335
Someone just robbed the church
on Becker.

54:03.918 --> 54:05.534
I know they wanted
my money.

54:05.668 --> 54:07.061
You think it was Serento?

54:07.085 --> 54:07.942
Duh!

54:08.001 --> 54:10.918
He thinks
he can steal my money?

54:11.126 --> 54:12.701
Listen to me, Cesar.

54:13.376 --> 54:14.635
Please pay attention.

54:16.168 --> 54:18.418
- I want my building guarded.
-Okay.

54:18.626 --> 54:21.626
Put the money in the
strongest vault there is.

54:22.460 --> 54:24.092
And kill Serento.

54:25.251 --> 54:27.143
- You got it?
- I got it, boss.

54:29.385 --> 54:31.210
Lo Qué es, el medio parte que?
(What was it? The middle part ?)

54:31.626 --> 54:32.710
What?

54:32.876 --> 54:34.248
Uh..

54:34.273 --> 54:35.460
Building.. guarded.

54:35.483 --> 54:36.708
No..no.

54:38.510 --> 54:39.643
The vault?

54:39.751 --> 54:41.001
No, no.
Not that, the..

54:41.501 --> 54:43.751
- Kill Serento?
- Right!

54:44.251 --> 54:45.659
Now I understand.

54:45.668 --> 54:48.284
Guard the building and
put Serento in the vault!

54:50.918 --> 54:53.985
I'll just better text you
the needs, mijo (my son).

54:54.001 --> 54:55.251
It's for the best.

54:56.126 --> 54:59.717
Now, now you have instructions
in your cellphone.

55:00.460 --> 55:02.534
- I didn't get it.
- But I already sent it!

55:02.759 --> 55:03.675
No.

55:03.876 --> 55:05.918
Aye!
You have the 4G network?

55:06.126 --> 55:07.400
Yes.
Of course.

55:07.668 --> 55:09.701
I'm still under the 3G,
it's much slower.

55:09.876 --> 55:13.501
How can I run a major criminal empire..

55:13.710 --> 55:15.726
And not having the same network?

55:16.001 --> 55:18.099
Well uh,
in three months.

55:18.224 --> 55:19.666
my contract is going to end.

55:19.751 --> 55:22.175
And then I plan to upgrade
to the newest network.

55:22.251 --> 55:25.710
But in 3 months,
that would be 5G!

55:26.034 --> 55:27.034
Okay.

55:27.775 --> 55:30.550
How about you give me your phone.
And then you get a new one.

55:30.668 --> 55:32.885
- I'm going to kill you.
- We go now.

55:42.001 --> 55:43.585
They're wearing ski masks.

55:44.043 --> 55:47.918
They must have gone skiing
immediately before or after the crime.

55:48.085 --> 55:50.626
Contact the Aspen police,
the Canadian Mounties,

55:50.652 --> 55:53.259
and Whistler in the Swiss Alps special forces.
See what they know.

55:53.543 --> 55:54.409
Right sir.

55:54.418 --> 55:56.085
And take a look at this.

56:02.775 --> 56:03.867
That's Vin Serento.

56:03.960 --> 56:05.260
He's involved too.

56:05.467 --> 56:06.612
Triangulate the area.

56:06.637 --> 56:09.760
I want every available officers
to be on the lookout for these guys.

56:09.793 --> 56:11.543
Serento's chop shop must be close by.

56:14.876 --> 56:17.376
And for God sake.
Someone get me some more baby oil!

56:20.217 --> 56:22.001
How is it going on fingerprint match?

56:23.635 --> 56:24.851
Uh,
still nothing.

56:27.585 --> 56:30.501
Wherever you fugitives are,
I'll find you.

56:30.710 --> 56:33.168
You hear me?
I will find you!

56:38.085 --> 56:39.460
How about this t-shirt?

56:40.661 --> 56:41.501
Sir?

56:41.525 --> 56:42.717
Is it tight enough?

56:43.251 --> 56:44.534
Is it tight enough?

56:44.626 --> 56:47.485
Yes, I mean I can see your nipples
and everything.

56:47.501 --> 56:48.610
You're damn right.

56:48.635 --> 56:50.559
That's what I'm going for.

56:57.376 --> 56:58.960
Alright.
Here's the deal.

56:59.043 --> 57:01.451
1414 Becker Street,
is a Mexican restaurant,

57:01.460 --> 57:03.050
called Big Ass Tacos.

57:03.126 --> 57:05.010
De La Sol's using it as a front.

57:05.210 --> 57:07.059
I love Big Ass Tacos.

57:13.585 --> 57:15.135
It's a perfect cover.

57:15.710 --> 57:18.184
While unsuspecting customers
chow down,

57:18.251 --> 57:20.409
De La Sol got a secret room
at the back.

57:20.668 --> 57:22.498
De La Sol's stash must be there.

57:22.523 --> 57:25.824
Cos they brought in "The
strongest Vault There is."

57:25.960 --> 57:28.501
A vault big enough to hold
a $100 million plus.

57:29.751 --> 57:33.376
But this place is locked down harder than
Lindsay Lohan's liquor cabinet.

57:33.585 --> 57:35.146
If they see us,

57:35.172 --> 57:36.525
we're dead.

57:36.800 --> 57:39.601
But I got a foolproof plan.
That's going to get us the money.

57:39.668 --> 57:41.576
And they'll never know what hit them.

57:41.626 --> 57:44.235
First, we need eyes on the inside.

57:44.293 --> 57:46.117
That's where Jordana and Michelle
come in.

57:47.085 --> 57:49.668
Now before you get into the vault,
there is a counting room.

57:49.668 --> 57:52.050
De La Sol doesn't trust the counter
from stealing.

57:52.085 --> 57:54.701
So to make sure they are not
hiding cash in their clothes.

57:54.710 --> 57:56.742
He makes them all work butt naked.

57:56.751 --> 57:58.217
Everyone's nude.

57:58.251 --> 58:00.025
Even the guards.

58:02.126 --> 58:04.143
You two will get jobs
as new counters.

58:04.251 --> 58:05.342
Wait.

58:05.751 --> 58:08.760
All of these girls are
totally naked and super hot?

58:08.918 --> 58:10.300
Perfect tits.

58:11.543 --> 58:13.550
Every last one of them.

58:14.293 --> 58:15.385
Continue.

58:15.918 --> 58:19.418
Now everyday at 3 o'clock,
right after he finishes watching Judge Judy.

58:19.425 --> 58:23.043
De La Sol comes in to check
on the money in the vault.

58:27.210 --> 58:30.393
Michelle,
you improvise a distraction.

58:43.376 --> 58:44.775
The guard rush over.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.717
Alone, Jordana will slip away
and spy on

58:46.742 --> 58:49.043
De La Sol as he opens the vault.

58:54.242 --> 58:55.559
What you'll find is that.

58:55.626 --> 58:59.693
The vault is encrypted with a high tech
DNA code that matches De La Sol's.

59:08.434 --> 59:10.460
So. We need a sample
of De La Sol's DNA.

59:10.485 --> 59:12.791
If we're going to
get into that safe.

59:14.543 --> 59:16.476
Come On!
Get out of here!

59:16.793 --> 59:17.867
Out!

59:19.793 --> 59:22.668
De La Sol takes a 10 mile run
every morning through the city.

59:23.126 --> 59:26.284
And that's where Model Turned Actress and
Cool Asian Guy come into play.

59:27.168 --> 59:30.818
Model Turned Actress will drive by
getting De La Sol's attention.

59:31.001 --> 59:34.018
And he will say something like..
"Nice boobies."

59:34.376 --> 59:35.559
Then Cool Asian Guy will appear

59:35.626 --> 59:37.335
and say something like..

59:37.543 --> 59:39.784
"Did you just said 'nice boobies'
to my girlfriend? "

59:39.835 --> 59:43.385
And he will reply:
"I don't know, it's that your girlfriend?"

59:43.409 --> 59:44.583
"Yup"

59:44.585 --> 59:47.610
"Well then,
I said 'nice boobies'."

59:47.668 --> 59:49.335
That's when you have to defend her honor.

59:49.501 --> 59:52.159
"So then I must defend her honor
and challenge you to a ...

59:53.168 --> 59:54.217
"Karate fight."

59:54.376 --> 59:57.451
Oh, cos I'm Asian.
You automatically assume I know karate?

59:57.501 --> 59:58.293
Do you?

59:58.318 --> 01:00:00.692
Yeah, I'm a 3rd degree
black belt.

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:04.110
That's a total coincidence.

01:00:04.126 --> 01:00:05.726
Anyway,
you'll fight him.

01:00:12.784 --> 01:00:14.460
You will do spinning windmills.

01:00:14.626 --> 01:00:17.309
Leg sweeps,
and flying side kicks.

01:00:33.251 --> 01:00:35.668
Then De La Sol will start working your face
like a punching bag.

01:00:35.835 --> 01:00:38.726
All in the effort to get De La Sol
to build up a nice sweat.

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:42.226
So Model Turned Actress can collect
DNA sample from his upper ass crack.

01:00:42.251 --> 01:00:43.326
Ass crack?

01:00:43.335 --> 01:00:45.492
The purest form of DNA.

01:01:02.168 --> 01:01:05.592
Now that we have a sample of his DNA,
we can unlock the safe.

01:01:05.751 --> 01:01:07.992
How we ever get near the vault
to open it?

01:01:08.001 --> 01:01:09.576
That's where you come in,
Rapper Cameo.

01:01:10.126 --> 01:01:12.753
We're going to give you the DNA
sample to unlock the vault.

01:01:12.778 --> 01:01:14.617
Shove you in a box and
shipped you there.

01:01:14.684 --> 01:01:15.876
Say what?

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.409
We'll send you ground.
3 to 5 days shipping.

01:01:18.626 --> 01:01:20.001
3 to 5 days?

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.867
We looked into overnight.
But the rate was outrageous.

01:01:23.043 --> 01:01:24.335
Come on, man!

01:01:24.918 --> 01:01:28.251
You will get delivered and placed by the vault,
waiting further instructions.

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.967
That brings us to Curtis.

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:31.876
You'll be the decoy.

01:01:32.418 --> 01:01:34.710
You'll knock on the door.
And when the guards open up.

01:01:34.793 --> 01:01:35.842
You tickle him.

01:01:35.909 --> 01:01:38.242
- Did you say tickle?
- Did I stutter?

01:01:39.085 --> 01:01:41.793
You'll run around the alley dodging bullets.

01:01:42.793 --> 01:01:44.559
And that will draw the other naked guard to

01:01:44.626 --> 01:01:46.309
rush outside and shooting you.

01:01:46.876 --> 01:01:47.943
When Rapper Cameo

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:51.175
hears all the gun fire,
he'll pop out like jack in a box.

01:01:51.585 --> 01:01:53.967
He'll run over to the door
and lock out the guards.

01:01:55.293 --> 01:01:58.550
He'll then use the ass crack
DNA sample to unlock the vault.

01:01:59.751 --> 01:02:01.826
Now back outside,
Curtis will finally get shot.

01:02:01.876 --> 01:02:03.085
Get shot?

01:02:03.626 --> 01:02:06.309
Yes.
And mainly in the groin.

01:02:08.835 --> 01:02:11.492
And when the guards go to check to see
if Curtis is finally dead ...

01:02:11.559 --> 01:02:12.768
I die?

01:02:12.967 --> 01:02:14.260
We pull up.

01:02:14.425 --> 01:02:16.951
Catching them off guard,
and take them out.

01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:22.085
Rapper Cameo opens up from the inside,

01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:23.268
We load up the cars with the cash.

01:02:23.335 --> 01:02:25.460
Then me and bro,
rendezvous with Jordana,

01:02:25.626 --> 01:02:29.418
Michelle, Model Turned Actress,
Rapper Cameo and Cool Asian Guy,

01:02:29.585 --> 01:02:31.818
in an extradition free exotic locale.

01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:33.576
And the best part of the plan?

01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:36.068
No casualty what so ever.

01:02:36.126 --> 01:02:37.809
Except for Curtis.
Of cos.

01:02:38.668 --> 01:02:39.710
Son of a...

01:02:42.543 --> 01:02:44.342
So, what do you say ?

01:02:54.735 --> 01:02:56.309
Okay, second idea.

01:02:56.376 --> 01:02:58.643
We bust in, blow open the vault and
drive off.

01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:00.001
- Yeah! Uh-huh.
- That's good.

01:03:00.168 --> 01:03:01.668
- Yeah! I like that, plan B.
- I like that one.

01:03:01.835 --> 01:03:02.934
I'm down with that.

01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:04.585
Yeah, yes.

01:03:07.001 --> 01:03:08.201
We ride at dawn.

01:03:08.226 --> 01:03:09.750
Dawn, really?

01:03:09.835 --> 01:03:11.335
What's wrong with dawn?

01:03:11.793 --> 01:03:15.385
It's so early,
dawn is before breakfast.

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:18.193
Yeah.
And I am no good without breakfast.

01:03:21.668 --> 01:03:23.960
Fine.
We ride after breakfast.

01:03:24.126 --> 01:03:27.643
How about we all go out for breakfast.
iHop would be fun?

01:03:27.668 --> 01:03:29.418
- Yeah!
- Yeah. That's good, that's good.

01:03:30.085 --> 01:03:31.885
Their pancakes are the bomb.

01:03:32.626 --> 01:03:33.918
We ride...

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.126
after iHop.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.601
Hey Curtis.

01:03:44.626 --> 01:03:47.101
Did you finish fixing up the Smart car?

01:03:48.668 --> 01:03:50.226
What you think?

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.568
Nice.

01:03:52.876 --> 01:03:54.168
Real nice.

01:03:56.876 --> 01:03:58.501
And I got a little something for you.

01:03:58.543 --> 01:03:59.876
Thanks, man.

01:04:01.168 --> 01:04:02.851
My unicorn car!

01:04:03.793 --> 01:04:05.951
- What?
- You fixed it up?

01:04:07.126 --> 01:04:08.168
For me?

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:09.760
Surprise.

01:04:09.983 --> 01:04:11.000
No.

01:04:11.001 --> 01:04:12.085
It's a simple gesture.

01:04:12.251 --> 01:04:13.835
to show how special you are to us.

01:04:15.668 --> 01:04:19.085
Giving your sweeten
loving present to him.

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:22.393
What's his name?

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:25.568
Mom was right.

01:04:25.835 --> 01:04:28.842
I should have joined an ordinary
motorcycle gang instead!

01:04:36.918 --> 01:04:38.150
What a baby ...

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:43.967
I still need to talk to you.

01:04:44.043 --> 01:04:46.543
Before you do.
There's something I need to tell you.

01:04:47.585 --> 01:04:48.751
I know what's going on.

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:51.793
- You do?
- Of course. Every one does.

01:04:52.335 --> 01:04:54.684
It's not like you have done
a very good job at hiding it.

01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:57.635
You don't know what a relief
that is.

01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:59.684
- You're fat!
- Excuse me?

01:04:59.751 --> 01:05:02.617
I'm sorry, but it's obviously
you got quite a muffin top going on.

01:05:04.251 --> 01:05:07.443
Jeez,
you look like a fat Jonah Hill!

01:05:07.543 --> 01:05:10.550
Wait, Jonah Hill might actually be skinny now.
Let me think.

01:05:10.751 --> 01:05:13.610
Fat in Superbad,
Really fat in Moneyball,

01:05:13.668 --> 01:05:15.251
then in 21 Jump Street ...

01:05:15.543 --> 01:05:17.635
I don't know if he is fat or thin.

01:05:18.376 --> 01:05:19.960
I'm so confuse now.

01:05:25.543 --> 01:05:28.034
Anyway, have you no pride
in your appearance?

01:05:28.085 --> 01:05:30.918
- I am pregnant.
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:05:45.501 --> 01:05:47.159
What car is this?

01:05:48.626 --> 01:05:50.135
It's my old man's car.

01:05:50.751 --> 01:05:52.251
He died in it.

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.550
(WORLD GREATEST DAD)

01:05:56.543 --> 01:05:58.043
You guys get along?

01:05:58.418 --> 01:05:59.835
He was the best.

01:06:00.585 --> 01:06:02.835
I never knew my father.

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:05.751
He went out for a pack of smokes ...

01:06:05.918 --> 01:06:07.251
And he never came back?

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.751
No, he came back and told me to
"Smoke up, because he was leaving."

01:06:11.376 --> 01:06:12.376
I was 8 years old.

01:06:12.585 --> 01:06:15.001
You were just a kid.
It wasn't your fault.

01:06:15.168 --> 01:06:17.210
He kind of said it was.

01:06:17.376 --> 01:06:18.626
He said before I was born,

01:06:18.793 --> 01:06:21.126
He used to have sex with my mom
all the time.

01:06:21.335 --> 01:06:23.001
They would go out and see movies.

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:26.001
Travel to interesting places
like Naper Valley or Belize,

01:06:26.168 --> 01:06:28.735
But now, he couldn't do
anything fun anymore.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.184
But you still had your mother.

01:06:30.293 --> 01:06:33.342
Wow, he made such compelling argument
that she left too.

01:06:33.376 --> 01:06:36.751
- You grew up in an orphanage?
- And from foster home to foster home.

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:41.168
Seems that no one wants a perfectly
good blue eye white baby anymore.

01:06:42.126 --> 01:06:45.126
Unless you are from Namibia with
flies buzzing around your eyeballs.

01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:46.291
You are no good to anyone.

01:06:46.293 --> 01:06:48.226
You can't fight celebrity trends.

01:06:48.543 --> 01:06:49.851
Brangelina,

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:51.768
Madonna,

01:06:52.335 --> 01:06:53.476
Sandy Bullock,

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:55.101
they all have black babies.

01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:57.260
I know.

01:07:00.751 --> 01:07:02.793
I knocked up your sister.

01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:07.226
She told me.

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.010
So, what are you going to do?

01:07:13.585 --> 01:07:15.735
You going to be like your old man
and take off?

01:07:16.418 --> 01:07:18.726
Or you're going to
stick it out like my dad?

01:07:24.751 --> 01:07:28.876
Right after that picture was taken,
he took me for ice cream.

01:07:29.335 --> 01:07:31.168
What a special memory.

01:07:31.668 --> 01:07:33.610
And we robbed the joint.

01:07:55.626 --> 01:07:57.469
I'm sorry Detective Johnson but,

01:07:57.494 --> 01:07:59.349
I don't know what any of
those hand signals mean.

01:07:59.418 --> 01:08:01.210
I have to go pee pee.

01:08:03.543 --> 01:08:05.460
Go by the dumpster.

01:08:06.793 --> 01:08:08.992
Thanks,
don't go in without me.

01:08:19.626 --> 01:08:20.917
Son of a bitch!

01:08:23.442 --> 01:08:25.442
Go, go, go...

01:08:30.335 --> 01:08:31.609
Everyone freeze!

01:08:31.667 --> 01:08:32.951
Don't you move.
You son of a bitch.

01:08:33.018 --> 01:08:34.600
Or I'll blow your head off!

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:36.001
I said freeze.

01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:38.085
Lower your weapons and
surrender now!

01:08:38.376 --> 01:08:40.167
Finally got you, Serento.

01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:41.876
Your ass is mine.

01:08:45.393 --> 01:08:46.393
Uh..

01:08:47.417 --> 01:08:50.126
No one's there
and my hand is starting to cramp up.

01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:56.760
Fine!

01:08:59.376 --> 01:09:00.774
Must have just missed them.

01:09:00.792 --> 01:09:03.060
I know we shouldn't have gone to iHOP.

01:09:03.085 --> 01:09:04.926
I just can't resist those pancakes.

01:09:05.001 --> 01:09:07.975
Those chocolate eyes,
whipped cream hair.

01:09:08.376 --> 01:09:09.693
Take a look at this.

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:19.126
( ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PUT DE LA SOL
  AWAY FOR 3 LIFETIMES)

01:09:20.001 --> 01:09:23.201
There's enough evidence here to put
De La Sol away for 3 lifetimes.

01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:24.835
What's Serento up to?

01:09:25.626 --> 01:09:28.126
And how's it link to De la Sol?

01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:31.725
DON'T FORGET TO ROB DE LA SOL
OF HIS $100 million!  (HEIST DAY!)

01:09:39.751 --> 01:09:41.609
HEIST DAY!

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.010
What do you know ...

01:09:51.201 --> 01:09:53.118
They are having a once in a year sales
at Bloomies.

01:09:53.126 --> 01:09:54.185
Bloomies
Once a Year Sale

01:09:55.835 --> 01:09:57.143
Men, let's roll.

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:14.500
Everyone.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:16.385
Masks on.
Now.

01:10:24.085 --> 01:10:25.592
What the hell is that?

01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:28.784
What?
You said bring your own mask.

01:10:31.751 --> 01:10:33.193
Oh, come on!

01:10:35.667 --> 01:10:37.001
Forget it.
Forget it.

01:10:37.210 --> 01:10:38.318
No masks.

01:10:38.335 --> 01:10:40.376
Masks off!
Masks off!

01:10:49.842 --> 01:10:50.842
Okay

01:10:51.167 --> 01:10:53.440
We take these chains
and hook them to the back.

01:10:53.564 --> 01:10:54.965
Pull the wall down.

01:10:54.966 --> 01:10:56.375
Catch them by surprise.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.967
They never see us coming.

01:11:15.042 --> 01:11:16.835
They totally saw us coming.

01:11:22.835 --> 01:11:24.342
Somebody must have set us up.

01:11:25.876 --> 01:11:26.885
Hi, Curtis!

01:11:30.451 --> 01:11:32.076
You want to grab dinner later?

01:11:32.085 --> 01:11:33.251
Call me.

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.318
I'm going to kill you.

01:11:40.835 --> 01:11:42.368
Watch out, Vin!

01:11:52.251 --> 01:11:53.810
Why you do it,
Curtis?

01:11:55.167 --> 01:11:56.585
Sorry, Vin ...

01:11:58.501 --> 01:12:01.060
He was going to take me
to see One Direction.

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:02.960
One Direction?

01:12:09.376 --> 01:12:10.525
That's it!

01:12:11.542 --> 01:12:12.667
Now, it's personal!

01:12:14.751 --> 01:12:16.400
I'm going to kill you,
Cesar.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.909
He was my best friend.

01:12:21.335 --> 01:12:23.409
I thought we were best friends.

01:12:25.917 --> 01:12:27.126
Well, you are.

01:12:28.917 --> 01:12:30.835
Well, he was my BFF for a long time.

01:12:31.001 --> 01:12:32.501
You got to understand that.

01:12:38.126 --> 01:12:40.217
We had our fun together.

01:12:45.042 --> 01:12:47.176
- What are we going to do?
- Get in the car.

01:12:47.876 --> 01:12:50.475
Stick to the plan.
Pull that wall down.

01:12:51.542 --> 01:12:53.234
We're taking that vault.

01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:03.193
You just hit my smart car.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.751
Now , it's personaler ...

01:13:08.042 --> 01:13:09.301
It's more personal.

01:13:10.585 --> 01:13:12.859
I'm taking it personally.

01:13:14.126 --> 01:13:15.551
It's a personal matter!

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:18.443
Ah.. screw it.

01:13:30.376 --> 01:13:32.534
Keep flooring it,
give it all she's got.

01:13:33.126 --> 01:13:34.885
Why are we using walkie talkies?

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.510
Because I got them on sale.

01:13:50.518 --> 01:13:51.518
Whoa..

01:13:52.042 --> 01:13:54.085
Holy shit ...

01:13:54.542 --> 01:13:56.475
We do not see that every day.

01:14:07.001 --> 01:14:08.260
Is everything okay?

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:11.167
Not exactly,
per se.

01:14:13.292 --> 01:14:14.667
Per se?

01:14:25.835 --> 01:14:27.085
My money ...

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:29.984

Adios !

01:14:53.501 --> 01:14:54.710
Stop!

01:14:55.835 --> 01:14:57.417
Let her retract.

01:14:58.626 --> 01:15:00.335
And then,
this time,

01:15:00.501 --> 01:15:04.185
slower and evenly,
pull the seat belt.

01:15:09.208 --> 01:15:10.609
No, no..

01:15:15.001 --> 01:15:16.835
No, no.
Cesar, no,  again.

01:15:16.859 --> 01:15:17.958
Cesar!

01:15:19.292 --> 01:15:21.792
Do it again,
but this time ...

01:15:23.126 --> 01:15:25.001
Do it, even slowerly..

01:15:25.210 --> 01:15:26.768

Looks like we got company.

01:17:20.085 --> 01:17:21.693
Take them out!

Heads up.

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:32.393
I see her, Vin.

01:19:43.167 --> 01:19:45.284
- She hit the tank.
- Stop the car and let me out.

01:19:45.292 --> 01:19:46.055

and let you have your baby in prison.

But Michelle. How are you going to survive
in a all woman's prison?

01:19:54.585 --> 01:19:55.618

This Perros is dual-climate,

The climates are not separated.

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:47.626
It's just one climate!

01:21:47.792 --> 01:21:50.868
Do you see any invisible divider here?

01:21:50.876 --> 01:21:51.917
Look, look, look..

01:21:52.126 --> 01:21:54.143

01:21:57.751 --> 01:21:59.451
So if you really are at 60.

01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:02.626
And I'm at 90,
we are really at ...

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:05.251
75 degrees.

01:22:05.275 --> 01:22:06.475
Si, pero..
(Yes, but..)

01:22:06.484 --> 01:22:08.426
We are in the middle of
a car chase right now.

01:22:08.451 --> 01:22:10.350
And my temperature
is really high.

01:22:10.368 --> 01:22:13.585

01:22:22.001 --> 01:22:23.626
Seat warmer.

01:22:25.292 --> 01:22:27.268
- Hun?

01:22:29.251 --> 01:22:30.768
Now,

01:22:36.626 --> 01:22:39.659
It's okay ...
I'm okay, I'm okay!

01:22:55.210 --> 01:22:57.143
Let's play.

01:22:58.376 --> 01:22:59.693
I got you!

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.826
Go GTA on your ass!

01:23:14.085 --> 01:23:15.743
- You only 5 foot 8?
-Yeah

01:23:16.751 --> 01:23:18.025
You look taller.

01:23:18.835 --> 01:23:20.010
Thank you.

01:23:21.585 --> 01:23:23.467
I pride myself of my good points...

01:23:26.085 --> 01:23:27.710
(Wasted)

01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:30.234
Totally out smart him.

01:23:30.501 --> 01:23:31.859
What a dummy ...

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:38.810
Son of a bitch!

01:23:39.835 --> 01:23:41.626
Locked my keys in my car again!

01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:50.551
Yes.

01:23:56.626 --> 01:23:59.501
Vin, we can't outrun him.
We need a way out of the city.

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:02.217
I'm way ahead of you.
Getting directions now.

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.210
Calculating route.

01:24:06.001 --> 01:24:07.626
Calculating.

01:24:07.835 --> 01:24:10.685
Right turn in 200 feet.

01:24:14.335 --> 01:24:16.342
Damn it,
missed the turn.

01:24:16.417 --> 01:24:17.501
Bald loser!

01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:21.042
I shave my head because it makes me
look cool and tough..

01:24:21.585 --> 01:24:23.917
Oh darn.
Your dashboard is dirty.

01:24:24.335 --> 01:24:26.460
Could use some..
Mr. Clean..

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:28.326
I'm not going bald.
If that's what you are implying.

01:24:28.335 --> 01:24:30.085
Whatever,
penis head.

01:24:30.292 --> 01:24:33.792
Just because I am bald.
with thick veiny neck muscles.

01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:37.542
Does not.. make me..
a penis head!

01:24:39.085 --> 01:24:40.243
Damn it!

01:24:42.417 --> 01:24:43.467
Pull over!

01:24:43.585 --> 01:24:44.493
Pull over!

01:24:44.501 --> 01:24:46.167
Pull over!
This must end now!

01:24:46.376 --> 01:24:48.518
This action scene has
gone on for long enough.

01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:50.009
The movie is way over budget!

01:24:50.042 --> 01:24:53.225
Vin, they are gaining!
We really need those directions!

01:24:53.292 --> 01:24:54.667
- So annoying.
- So annoying..

01:24:54.876 --> 01:24:56.126
So annoying..So annoying..

01:24:56.335 --> 01:24:57.326
Shut up!

01:24:57.335 --> 01:24:58.335
- Shut up!
- Vin..

01:24:58.917 --> 01:25:00.393
- We are waiting!
- Shut up.

01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:01.525
I'm on it!

01:25:01.917 --> 01:25:04.893
We can't out run him.
We got to dislodge the Big Ass Tacos.

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.868
When we hit the intersection.
You go left, I'll go right.

01:25:08.001 --> 01:25:09.010
Question.

01:25:09.710 --> 01:25:11.409
My left or your 1eft?

01:25:12.667 --> 01:25:14.292
You only have one left,
right?

01:25:14.501 --> 01:25:15.510
Got it!

01:25:19.917 --> 01:25:20.926
Hang on.

01:25:21.585 --> 01:25:23.751
Are you saying 'right' like
you agree..

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:26.493
or right ,
like you are going to turn right?

01:25:26.710 --> 01:25:28.768
We are at the intersection,
turn now!

01:25:41.292 --> 01:25:42.292
Whoa.

01:25:54.001 --> 01:25:55.993
Not on my watch,
De La Sol.

01:26:02.335 --> 01:26:04.542
Freeze.!
Don't move!

01:26:05.001 --> 01:26:06.217
Hands up.

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:09.850
Get out of the car.

01:26:20.751 --> 01:26:23.443
How do I get out of the car
when my hands are up?

01:26:24.501 --> 01:26:25.876
Get out of the car.

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:39.826
What the hell are you doing?

01:26:41.167 --> 01:26:42.693
You told me to "Hands up."

01:26:43.626 --> 01:26:46.251
Look's like you are going away for
a long time. De La Sol.

01:26:47.167 --> 01:26:48.368
(BUSTED)

01:26:48.626 --> 01:26:50.359
Come on,
Detective...

01:26:51.042 --> 01:26:52.859
I'm sure we can work something out.

01:26:52.917 --> 01:26:55.693
Are you seriously trying to bribe
a federal officer?

01:27:04.292 --> 01:27:06.126
I can give you whatever you want.

01:27:06.292 --> 01:27:08.126
Even tighter spandex shirts.

01:27:09.376 --> 01:27:11.792
Human growth hormones agent?

01:27:13.126 --> 01:27:15.126
Or perhaps..
a deluxe ...

01:27:15.667 --> 01:27:17.493
Manscaper razor set.

01:27:22.667 --> 01:27:23.960
Get out of here.

01:27:25.751 --> 01:27:26.826
Scored!

01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:38.949
Serento!

01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:46.484
You're under arrest .

01:27:46.551 --> 01:27:47.600
Let her go.

01:27:47.667 --> 01:27:49.275
Take it easy with her,
she's pregnant!

01:27:49.335 --> 01:27:51.784
Don't move,
Put your hands where I can see them.

01:27:52.542 --> 01:27:54.818
Not you, Officer White.
You can put your hands down.

01:27:56.335 --> 01:27:57.618
White officer?

01:27:58.376 --> 01:28:00.060
Did a little checking into you.

01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:05.600
I fell in love with you
and you're a cop?

01:28:05.835 --> 01:28:08.493
Undercover,
brought in to take you down.

01:28:08.667 --> 01:28:11.542
Good work.
You will be given a promotion for this.

01:28:11.542 --> 01:28:14.210
I'll personally see to it.
Personally.

01:28:14.284 --> 01:28:16.376
I'll let you do the honors.
Officer White.

01:28:24.835 --> 01:28:26.284
Son of a bitch!

01:28:31.542 --> 01:28:33.217
I'm not a cop anymore.

01:28:34.417 --> 01:28:36.126
I am with them.

01:28:36.542 --> 01:28:40.100
You're going to turn down
$ 32,500 a year before taxes.

01:28:40.167 --> 01:28:43.243
Three unpaid vacation days,
and a bankrupt picture plan and what.

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:45.534
Run off with a $ 100 million,
scott free?

01:28:45.542 --> 01:28:48.368
Living on an exotic beach,
raising your baby with a beauty woman?

01:28:48.751 --> 01:28:50.167
Well ...
yeah.

01:28:51.417 --> 01:28:53.201
That's kind of no brainer.

01:28:57.667 --> 01:28:58.876
Damn it!

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.335
My baby oil!

01:29:09.658 --> 01:29:10.759
No!

01:29:40.210 --> 01:29:42.042
Race you to Rio?

01:29:42.885 --> 01:29:44.159
When're you going to learn.

01:29:44.184 --> 01:29:45.684
You ain't going to beat me.

01:29:47.585 --> 01:29:50.751
- Usually bet?
- No, let's up the stakes.

01:29:50.876 --> 01:29:52.534
We're talking all in.

01:29:53.001 --> 01:29:54.734
Jordana's unborn baby?

01:29:55.792 --> 01:29:57.167
Exactly.

01:29:57.585 --> 01:29:58.835
You're on.

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:02.542
Don't worry babe,
I got this.

01:30:17.751 --> 01:30:19.210
It's over now!

01:30:21.792 --> 01:30:23.326
Now give me back my money.

01:30:25.335 --> 01:30:26.835
Or I'll kill all of you.

01:30:28.167 --> 01:30:30.251
And I'll going to start with ...

01:30:31.417 --> 01:30:32.876
you.

01:30:37.835 --> 01:30:39.350
Did you hear that?

01:30:39.375 --> 01:30:40.375
No.

01:31:00.501 --> 01:31:01.960
Calculating route.

01:31:02.167 --> 01:31:04.335
Calculating, calculating,
calculating..

01:31:04.542 --> 01:31:05.926
That's what I'm talking about.

01:31:06.126 --> 01:31:09.001
Right turn
 in 200 feet.

01:31:12.710 --> 01:31:13.960
Who's the boss?

01:31:14.126 --> 01:31:16.510
Left turn
in 100 feet.

01:31:19.210 --> 01:31:20.667
Who's in charge?

01:31:20.835 --> 01:31:23.435
Me, that's who.

01:31:23.501 --> 01:31:24.542
Congratulations.

01:31:24.792 --> 01:31:26.960
You have reached your destination.

01:31:39.585 --> 01:31:40.859
Come on!

01:31:41.042 --> 01:31:42.176
Deal with it,

01:31:42.177 --> 01:31:43.435
Bald bitch!

01:31:51.835 --> 01:31:53.626
I didn't heard "cut"!

01:31:56.710 --> 01:31:57.751
Fine.

01:31:58.251 --> 01:32:00.042
Stop, dude.

01:32:00.917 --> 01:32:01.876
Do you know ...

01:32:02.001 --> 01:32:02.917
Shit!

You taking him over me?

01:32:05.417 --> 01:32:06.376
This is tough, dude.

01:32:07.042 --> 01:32:07.960
- Stop!
- Sorry.

01:32:10.085 --> 01:32:12.876
You can forget about coming over tonight

01:32:23.210 --> 01:32:24.268
Sorry!

01:32:27.835 --> 01:32:30.501
You want the job or not?
God damn it.

01:32:30.667 --> 01:32:32.460
Do you want?

01:32:33.126 --> 01:32:35.876
Don't laugh!
You take it or not?

01:32:37.751 --> 01:32:39.710
I'm sorry.

01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:58.960
What car is this?

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:03.042
What are you doing?

01:33:07.835 --> 01:33:09.167
I can't!

01:33:11.376 --> 01:33:12.409
Is that rolling it.

01:33:13.835 --> 01:33:15.001
And?

Before you do,
there's something I need to tell you.

I know what's going on.

01:33:37.085 --> 01:33:38.501
I know what's going on.

01:33:40.001 --> 01:33:41.010
Sorry.

01:33:41.710 --> 01:33:44.335
How about I borrow your phone.
And then you go buy a new one.

- Why am I crying?
- I don't know!

01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:12.710
This is a funny movie,

I do not know!
Please.

01:34:15.042 --> 01:34:17.042
I don't know sorry!

01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:20.626
- It's suppose to be a funny movie!
- It wasn't funny.

01:34:21.417 --> 01:34:24.085
