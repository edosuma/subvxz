It's spring break this week,
so Zoey and her daughter

00:05.529 --> 00:06.366
are going to stay here.

00:06.367 --> 00:08.395
I'm going to need you
to move out for the week.

00:09.087 --> 00:09.985
Where you staying?

00:10.010 --> 00:11.021
I'm just going to have
to stay with Lindsey.

00:11.022 --> 00:13.490
There's someone
in the house. Go look.

00:16.043 --> 00:17.460
Ow!
What?!

00:17.462 --> 00:19.129
I'm sorry!

00:19.131 --> 00:21.664
No, no, don't touch it!

00:22.633 --> 00:24.033
I'm bored.

♪ ♪

00:30.691 --> 00:33.626
I can't do this, Berta.
It's just too much.

00:33.628 --> 00:35.128
She just never stops.

00:35.130 --> 00:38.314
So, how are things going living
with Zoey and her daughter?

00:38.316 --> 00:39.516
It's good. It's good.

00:39.518 --> 00:40.733
Oh.

00:40.735 --> 00:42.468
How's living with Lyndsey?

00:42.470 --> 00:45.071
Oh, it's terrific.
That's great.

00:45.073 --> 00:47.991

Yes, 100 times yes.

00:52.998 --> 00:54.480
Okay.

Zoey...

00:57.819 --> 00:59.752
you know I love you, and...

00:59.754 --> 01:02.338
I want to live with you forever.

01:02.340 --> 01:04.040
But we got to lose the kid.

01:07.011 --> 01:09.596
- Yeah, probably not.
-  Okay.

01:09.598 --> 01:12.832
Hey, have you ever thought
of Swiss boarding schools?

01:14.351 --> 01:16.002
Hi!
Sh...

01:16.004 --> 01:17.554
She's out like a light.

01:17.556 --> 01:21.674
Really? How?
Did you drug her?

01:21.676 --> 01:24.777
I didn't think
we were allowed to drug her.

01:24.779 --> 01:27.197
She's worn out
from playing with you all day.

01:27.199 --> 01:29.115
She's not the only one.

01:29.117 --> 01:32.902
Listen...

01:32.904 --> 01:34.037
I've been thinking about this

01:34.039 --> 01:37.690
whole "moving in together"
thing.

01:37.692 --> 01:40.877
It's all right.
I admit, I had my doubts.

01:40.879 --> 01:43.746
But you have been
so wonderful with her.

01:43.748 --> 01:45.582
Thank you.

01:45.584 --> 01:48.168
This little girl
loves you so much.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.552
Really...

01:49.554 --> 01:51.638
You're all she talks about.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.090
The sun rises and sets with you.

01:54.092 --> 01:56.576
Huh...

01:58.229 --> 01:59.829
Look at what she made for you.

02:03.184 --> 02:06.219
Wow...

02:06.221 --> 02:08.854
So, you win.
We're all yours.

02:08.857 --> 02:09.906
I mean,

02:09.907 --> 02:11.491
there's a million details
to figure out

02:11.493 --> 02:13.042
before we can move in
permanently.

02:13.044 --> 02:15.128
First and foremost, where she's
going to go to school.

02:15.130 --> 02:17.797
Have you ever considered
Switzerland?

02:17.799 --> 02:19.699
You're kidding, right?

02:19.701 --> 02:22.735
I'm ki.. of course!

02:22.737 --> 02:25.872
Why would I want her
so far away?

02:25.874 --> 02:29.008
Let me put her up to bed.
Then we can start making plans.

02:29.010 --> 02:30.243
Great.

02:30.245 --> 02:31.678
Mommy?
Hmm?

02:31.680 --> 02:32.762
Where's Walden?

02:32.764 --> 02:34.264
Oh, I'm right here.

Hey, roomie!

02:55.153 --> 02:57.036
You got here quick.

02:57.038 --> 02:58.955
Yeah, Lyndsey asked me
to fix the garbage disposal

02:58.957 --> 03:01.774
and I didn't like the odds.

03:01.776 --> 03:03.609
So, uh, did you talk
to Zoey yet?

03:03.611 --> 03:04.877
Yes, I did.

03:04.879 --> 03:05.628
How'd she take it?

03:05.630 --> 03:07.413
Well, I... yeah, let's...

03:07.415 --> 03:09.282
Did she cry?

03:09.284 --> 03:10.950
No...
Yelling?

03:10.952 --> 03:12.669
No. There was no yelling.

03:12.671 --> 03:16.005
Yeah, I know that I said
that I wanted to get rid of her

03:16.007 --> 03:17.590
and have you come back...

03:17.592 --> 03:19.058
Oh, no!

03:19.060 --> 03:21.060
You know, I, I love her.

03:21.062 --> 03:22.478
Oh, no!

03:22.480 --> 03:24.264
And I, I love the kid.

03:24.266 --> 03:25.481
No!

03:25.483 --> 03:27.183
I'm just going
to have to make it work.

03:27.185 --> 03:28.985
No, no, no, no, no, no!

03:28.987 --> 03:31.470
Alan, I'm sorry.

03:32.990 --> 03:36.025
Okay, okay, I'll...
I'll figure something out.

03:36.027 --> 03:39.162
If nothing else,
I am a survivor.

03:46.705 --> 03:49.005
Okay, very funny.
Survivor, I get it.

03:51.042 --> 03:54.294
Oh, come on!
I feel bad enough already.

04:34.443 --> 04:36.712
I want him to have
the best possible care.

04:36.714 --> 04:39.047
So, whatever it takes,
I'll pay for it.

04:39.049 --> 04:40.615
You're going to have to.

04:40.617 --> 04:44.052
The man's got the worst
insurance policy I've ever seen.

04:44.054 --> 04:47.723
What do you mean?
He's got a $500,000 deductible.

04:47.725 --> 04:50.092
A $500,000 deductible?

04:50.094 --> 04:51.560
Even at our prices,
he ain't gonna

04:51.562 --> 04:53.228
hit that with
one heart attack.

04:53.230 --> 04:55.847
All right, well, I'll just...
I'll take care of it.

04:55.849 --> 04:58.467
Just check the box
"Domestic Partner."

04:58.469 --> 05:01.937
Oh, no, we're just buddies.

05:01.939 --> 05:04.222
We got no buddy forms.

05:04.224 --> 05:07.325
Yeah, but...
Just check the damn box.

05:12.448 --> 05:16.535
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

05:16.537 --> 05:19.921
I guess there's nothing
to do now but wait.

05:19.923 --> 05:22.157
Forgive me
for being callous,

05:22.159 --> 05:24.843
but don't you think this heart
attack is a bit convenient?

05:24.845 --> 05:26.878
What?
Come on.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.047
He tries to weasel his way
back into the house.

05:29.049 --> 05:30.265
You tell him no

05:30.267 --> 05:32.517
and he falls to the ground,
clutching his chest.

05:32.519 --> 05:34.719
You think he faked
a heart attack?

05:34.721 --> 05:37.689
I think he'd fake
a shark attack.

05:37.691 --> 05:39.507
How do you fake
a shark attack?

05:39.509 --> 05:42.510
I don't know. Ask Alan.

05:42.512 --> 05:44.345
Harper?

05:44.347 --> 05:46.281
Yeah, right here.

05:46.283 --> 05:48.850
Okay, well, your boyfriend's
going to be fine.

05:48.852 --> 05:50.402
That's great.

05:50.404 --> 05:51.703
Uh, he's not my...

05:51.705 --> 05:53.205
It's great.

05:54.023 --> 05:55.657
It was the form.
It was just easier.

05:55.659 --> 05:59.411
Um, did he actually
have a heart attack?

05:59.413 --> 06:02.130
It was a mild one, but yes.
Told you.

06:03.115 --> 06:04.916
He should be fine.
He's just going to need rest

06:04.918 --> 06:06.168
and as little stress
as possible.

06:06.170 --> 06:07.836
For how long?

06:07.838 --> 06:09.721
I don't know,
at least a month or two.

06:09.723 --> 06:11.723
Great...

06:11.725 --> 06:14.226
That's why we gave up women.
Am I right?

06:15.845 --> 06:17.245
It's a compelling argument.

06:24.670 --> 06:26.054
Hi.

06:26.056 --> 06:28.523
Hi, Walden.

06:28.525 --> 06:30.158
How ya feelin'?

06:30.160 --> 06:32.594
Fan-tastic.

06:32.596 --> 06:35.113
I'm on a morphine drip.

06:37.066 --> 06:41.236
Everyone should have
a morphine drip.

06:41.238 --> 06:44.239
There would be no more war.

06:44.241 --> 06:46.758
Listen, the doctor said

06:46.760 --> 06:50.045
that you... had
a little heart attack,

06:50.047 --> 06:51.513
but you're going to be fine.

06:51.515 --> 06:53.982
Oh, yeah.

06:53.984 --> 06:56.017
Yeah, I remember now.

06:56.019 --> 06:58.303
Zoey's moving in and...

06:58.305 --> 07:00.588
I'm... I'm moving out.

07:03.926 --> 07:05.760
No, you're not moving out.

07:05.762 --> 07:07.395
I'm-I'm not?

07:07.397 --> 07:10.765
No, you can stay as long as you
want. As long as you need.

07:10.767 --> 07:12.200
Oh.

07:15.322 --> 07:18.123
Oh, that's...
that's so good to hear.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.625
Thataboy.

07:20.627 --> 07:24.129
I just... I just want you
to not worry about anything.

07:24.131 --> 07:25.130
I won't.

07:25.132 --> 07:26.781
Okay.

07:26.783 --> 07:28.783
You just relax
and feel better, okay?

07:28.785 --> 07:30.752
Okeydokey.

07:33.289 --> 07:35.290
Hey, Walden. Guess what?

07:35.292 --> 07:36.457
What?

07:36.459 --> 07:40.245
I'm peeing right now.

07:40.247 --> 07:41.880
No kidding.

07:41.882 --> 07:43.798
But it's okay.

07:43.800 --> 07:48.353
There's a tube
attached to my wiener.

07:52.275 --> 07:54.459
I don't think there is.

07:57.747 --> 07:59.981
Oh...

08:01.000 --> 08:02.500
<i>Men...</i>

08:02.502 --> 08:05.453
- My God. He's going to be okay?
- Yeah.

08:05.455 --> 08:07.038
He just needs
to take it easy.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.957
I don't know
what I would do

08:08.959 --> 08:10.491
if anything
happened to him.

08:12.879 --> 08:15.046
I've already lost my good son!

08:18.134 --> 08:20.769
Do you happen to know
if they validate parking?

08:24.173 --> 08:26.107
So, are those tubes
putting stuff in

08:26.109 --> 08:27.359
or taking stuff out?

08:27.361 --> 08:29.344
I think
a little bit of both.

08:29.346 --> 08:30.779
Oh, I get it.

08:30.781 --> 08:33.782
It's like eating
on the toilet.

08:33.784 --> 08:35.500
So, what did the doctor say?

08:35.501 --> 08:37.785
Uh, he just said
he needs to take it easy.

08:37.788 --> 08:38.953
You know, no stress.

08:38.956 --> 08:40.554
Then I guess
we shouldn't tell him

08:40.557 --> 08:41.722
about what happened
at school.

08:41.725 --> 08:44.459
No, we definitely
should not.

08:44.461 --> 08:47.362
Honest to God, someone
put that pot in my locker.

08:49.098 --> 08:50.415
Why would they do that?

08:50.417 --> 08:54.102
That, my friend,
is the million-dollar question.

08:57.556 --> 08:58.673
Look, Lyndsey,

08:58.675 --> 08:59.975
I know you're his girlfriend,

08:59.977 --> 09:02.277
and I know you'd like
to take care of him, but...

09:02.279 --> 09:04.779
I kind of feel
responsible for this.

09:04.781 --> 09:07.599
And I'd like him to stay
with me until he recovers.

09:07.601 --> 09:09.734
Fine. Let's go
get some coffee.

09:14.357 --> 09:16.224
<i>Men...</i>

09:17.059 --> 09:18.410
Wake up, Alan.

09:21.064 --> 09:25.066
Is it spongebath time again?

09:25.068 --> 09:27.335
You wish.

09:33.125 --> 09:34.626
What's going on?

09:34.628 --> 09:35.743
Who are you?

09:35.745 --> 09:38.213
Ah, Alan, that hurts.

09:38.215 --> 09:40.598
Don't you recognize
your own brother?

09:52.479 --> 09:53.796
<i>Men...</i>

09:53.798 --> 09:55.581
What is this,
some kind of sick joke?

09:55.583 --> 09:57.333
Charlie's dead.

09:57.335 --> 10:00.687
You're dubious. Understandable.

10:00.689 --> 10:02.255
When you were 14 years old,

10:02.257 --> 10:04.123
you went to your first
boy/girl party,

10:04.125 --> 10:05.308
and you were really nervous

10:05.310 --> 10:06.759
because they were going to play
spin the bottle.

10:06.761 --> 10:07.593
Yeah?

10:07.595 --> 10:09.028
So, before you left the house,

10:09.030 --> 10:11.564
I convinced you that
the grownup way to French-kiss

10:11.566 --> 10:13.700
was to spit in the
other person's mouth.

10:15.486 --> 10:18.154
You hocked a big loogie
down Marcy Bilson's throat

10:18.156 --> 10:20.039
and she'd kicked you
in the nuts.

10:20.041 --> 10:23.276
Ah, come on, everybody in
high school knew that story.

10:23.278 --> 10:25.161
Answer me this:

10:25.163 --> 10:27.997
What are your five favorite
words to hear from a woman?

10:27.999 --> 10:31.434
"I can't spend the night."

10:32.136 --> 10:34.137
Charlie...

10:34.139 --> 10:36.455
At your service.

10:36.457 --> 10:38.625
I don't...
I don't understand.

10:38.627 --> 10:41.127
Are you reincarnated
or something?

10:41.129 --> 10:43.146
Nah, I'm in hell.

10:45.649 --> 10:48.101
Walking around
in this old broad's body

10:48.103 --> 10:51.304
is supposed to be some kind
of eternal damnation.

10:52.573 --> 10:53.489
You know what?

10:53.491 --> 10:55.241
The joke's on them.

10:55.243 --> 10:57.777
Boobs are still boobs.

11:00.281 --> 11:01.781
So, why are you here?

11:01.783 --> 11:03.366
I thought you could use
a little help.

11:03.368 --> 11:04.968
I have been through
a rough patch.

11:04.970 --> 11:07.470
You look like you've been
through a propeller.

11:08.739 --> 11:10.823
I came here to tell you
it's not too late

11:10.825 --> 11:11.841
to turn your life around.

11:11.843 --> 11:12.659
How?

11:12.661 --> 11:14.344
Stop being a parasite.

11:14.346 --> 11:17.130
Step up. Be a man.
Grow a pair.

11:18.198 --> 11:21.334
Uh, parenthetically,
this body actually has a pair.

11:22.686 --> 11:25.104
They dangle
right under my hooha.

11:28.175 --> 11:30.810
Did not need to know that.

11:30.812 --> 11:33.646
Point being, you lived on me
for eight years

11:33.648 --> 11:35.398
and now you're
living off this new guy.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.350
Now, now, hang on.
W-Walden's my friend.

11:37.352 --> 11:39.068
He invited me
to stay with him.

11:39.070 --> 11:42.021
Oh, kiss my
surprisingly tight ass.

11:42.023 --> 11:44.290
You're nobody's friend.

11:44.292 --> 11:47.243
You're a useless appendage,
like tonsils,

11:47.245 --> 11:50.630
or the nutsack
under my hooha.

11:50.632 --> 11:54.083
I see hell hasn't
mellowed you out any.

11:54.085 --> 11:55.802
Listen to me,
you got to get out

11:55.804 --> 11:58.221
of that guy's house
and make a life for yourself.

11:58.223 --> 12:00.056
I suppose I could go
live with Lyndsey.

12:00.058 --> 12:01.707
You're missing my point.

12:01.709 --> 12:03.726
I'm not suggesting
that the tapeworm

12:03.728 --> 12:06.179
find a new colon
to crawl into.

12:07.348 --> 12:08.915
Hold out your hand.

12:10.684 --> 12:12.568
Thank you.

12:14.238 --> 12:15.721
This is your last chance, Alan.

12:15.723 --> 12:17.690
Move out of that house.
Get your own place.

12:17.692 --> 12:19.409
Start pulling your own weight
in the world.

12:19.411 --> 12:21.077
Okay. I will.

12:21.079 --> 12:22.996
You'll see.
I can change.

12:22.998 --> 12:24.497
Good.

12:24.499 --> 12:26.065
Then my work here is done.

12:26.067 --> 12:27.900
Well, thanks, Charlie.

12:27.902 --> 12:29.419
You got it.

12:29.421 --> 12:32.905
Oh, uh,

12:32.907 --> 12:34.090
Before I go...

12:35.009 --> 12:36.575
...you gotta check this out.

12:37.294 --> 12:38.177
Oh!

12:38.179 --> 12:39.745
Oh!

12:39.747 --> 12:41.414
Was I lying?

12:41.416 --> 12:43.783
Tell me that's not disturbing.

12:51.425 --> 12:53.426
<i>Men...</i>

12:53.428 --> 12:55.061
What do you want me
to do, Zoey?

12:55.063 --> 12:57.697
The last time I asked him
to leave, he almost died.

12:57.699 --> 12:58.898
Well, what does that mean?

12:58.900 --> 13:01.117
He lives with you
until he actually does die?

13:01.119 --> 13:03.736
No, just until he
gets back on his feet.

13:03.738 --> 13:05.788
The man has no feet.

13:05.790 --> 13:07.707
He is a footless man.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.375
Okay, come on.

13:09.377 --> 13:12.045
What about his mother?
Why doesn't he live with her?

13:12.047 --> 13:13.246
They don't really get along.

13:13.248 --> 13:14.831
What about his girlfriend?

13:14.833 --> 13:16.949
They don't really get along.

13:16.951 --> 13:18.418
Oh, God.

13:18.420 --> 13:20.086
So we're stuck with him forever.

13:20.088 --> 13:24.257
The man is the herpes
of houseguests.

13:25.677 --> 13:27.243
Come on.
That is not fair.

13:27.245 --> 13:28.311
You're right.

13:28.313 --> 13:30.646
Herpes sometimes disappears
for a while.

13:32.182 --> 13:33.566
Surprise!

13:33.568 --> 13:34.600
Alan.

13:34.602 --> 13:36.602
Herpes.

13:36.604 --> 13:37.970
What? They let you out?

13:37.972 --> 13:39.805
Oh, no, no.
I checked myself out.

13:39.807 --> 13:41.591
I didn't want you to have
to pay one more penny for me.

13:41.593 --> 13:42.641
Oh, come on.

13:42.643 --> 13:43.809
The money is not important.

13:43.811 --> 13:45.161
What's important
is your health.

13:45.163 --> 13:47.196
No, what's important
is that I stop being a parasite

13:47.198 --> 13:48.364
and stand on my own two feet.

13:48.366 --> 13:50.166
You have no feet.

13:51.535 --> 13:52.952
What was that?

13:52.954 --> 13:54.036
It's Zoey.

13:54.038 --> 13:55.988
I'll be right there, honey.

13:55.990 --> 13:58.875
I'm just going to grab my stuff,
and I'll get out of your hair.

13:58.877 --> 14:00.109
Are you sure?

14:00.111 --> 14:02.545
I am positive, Walden.
I-I have had an epiphany.

14:02.547 --> 14:04.680
I need to make a big change
in my life.

14:04.682 --> 14:06.516
Wow.

14:06.518 --> 14:07.683
Where will you go?

14:07.685 --> 14:09.602
Oh, I found a cute little place
online.

14:09.604 --> 14:10.937
Uh, you know, it's not much,

14:10.939 --> 14:13.055
but, uh, at least
I'll have my pride.

14:13.057 --> 14:14.524
I don't know, Alan.

14:14.526 --> 14:18.010
Let the man have his pride!

14:18.012 --> 14:21.531
Uh, here's my address
for mailing stuff.

14:22.950 --> 14:24.484
If this is what you want...

14:24.486 --> 14:25.284
It's what I want.

14:25.286 --> 14:26.986
It's what everybody wants!

14:28.872 --> 14:30.189
Don't listen to her.

14:30.191 --> 14:32.458
Oh, no, no.
She's right.

14:32.460 --> 14:35.578
She's an angry,
cold-hearted tea bag!

14:35.580 --> 14:38.214
But she's right.

14:38.216 --> 14:40.583
What did he say?

14:40.585 --> 14:42.919
He said that you were right.

14:44.888 --> 14:46.672
<i>Men...</i>

14:48.041 --> 14:49.208
No, Jake.

14:49.210 --> 14:50.643
If I'm not living
at the beach house,

14:50.645 --> 14:52.345
you're not living
at the beach house.

14:52.347 --> 14:55.231
Yeah, well, sometimes
life just isn't fair.

14:55.233 --> 14:58.568
Well, sure you can visit me
where I'm living now.

14:58.570 --> 15:00.653
But, uh, you're not going
to have your own room

15:00.655 --> 15:02.721
or your own bed
or your own bathroom

15:02.723 --> 15:05.391
and... you might need
to have a tetanus shot.

15:07.861 --> 15:10.046
But I'd love to have you.

15:10.048 --> 15:12.248
Okay, you let me know.

15:12.250 --> 15:15.084
Okay, good night.

15:19.206 --> 15:20.906
All right.

15:20.908 --> 15:22.959
It's not much, but...

15:22.961 --> 15:24.177
it's mine.

15:26.380 --> 15:28.598
I am self-sufficient.

15:31.051 --> 15:33.970
And beholden to no one.

15:41.529 --> 15:44.530
Oh, that's not a good sign.

15:47.368 --> 15:49.202
<i>Men...</i>

15:50.153 --> 15:51.654
It's odd...

15:51.656 --> 15:53.272
But now that
Alan's finally gone,

15:53.274 --> 15:54.991
I actually kind of miss him.

15:54.993 --> 15:56.325
Yeah, me too.

15:56.327 --> 15:57.793
Walden, I'm kidding.

15:59.446 --> 16:00.446
Oh, yeah, me too.

16:04.418 --> 16:05.835
So...

16:05.837 --> 16:07.970
Now that we have the house
to ourselves,

16:07.972 --> 16:09.171
what would you like to do?

16:09.173 --> 16:11.140
What I would like to do

16:11.142 --> 16:13.192
is you.

16:14.645 --> 16:16.312
And where I would like to do it,

16:16.314 --> 16:18.397
is on every flat surface

16:18.399 --> 16:20.633
in every room of this house.

16:20.635 --> 16:22.568
Mm.
Mm.

16:22.570 --> 16:24.136
Woo. Hey.

16:24.138 --> 16:26.639
Oh. Jake.

16:26.641 --> 16:27.573
This is my friend, Gabby.

16:27.575 --> 16:30.476
Hi!

16:30.478 --> 16:32.445
We're going to go hang out
in my room.

16:32.447 --> 16:34.113
Uh, Jake, uh,

16:34.115 --> 16:35.615
hold on.

16:35.617 --> 16:37.983
Have you spoken
to your father lately?

16:37.985 --> 16:40.486
No, I don't believe I have.

16:43.206 --> 16:44.507
Look at the bright side.

16:44.509 --> 16:45.958
What bright side?

16:45.960 --> 16:49.095
He might share some
of his pot with us.

16:50.430 --> 16:52.965
<i>Men...</i>

16:55.936 --> 16:58.871
Wake up, buttercup.

17:00.674 --> 17:03.392
Oh. Hey, Charlie.

17:04.778 --> 17:07.980
So, what do you think?

17:07.982 --> 17:09.949
I finally got my own place.

17:09.951 --> 17:11.867
Fantastic.

17:11.868 --> 17:14.337
You're not sponging off
that rat, are you?

17:15.989 --> 17:16.955
There's a rat?

17:16.958 --> 17:18.124
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.

17:18.126 --> 17:20.858
He's dead.

17:20.861 --> 17:24.363
But aren't you proud of me?
I mean, I did what you said.

17:24.365 --> 17:26.165
I'm standing
on my own two feet.

17:26.166 --> 17:29.051
Yeah.

17:29.053 --> 17:30.486
Sucker.

17:32.556 --> 17:33.806
What?

17:33.808 --> 17:35.891
I had to come back
from hell to do it,

17:35.893 --> 17:39.228
but I finally gotcha
out of my freakin' house!

17:40.597 --> 17:43.232
But I-I-I thought you wanted me
to be a better person.

17:43.234 --> 17:45.184
Nope.

17:45.186 --> 17:47.386
What? So you were just
screwing with me?

17:47.388 --> 17:49.054
Yep.

17:49.056 --> 17:50.889
Why?

17:50.891 --> 17:55.161
I'm in hell, Alan.
That's kind of what we do.

17:55.163 --> 17:56.912
Whoa!

17:56.914 --> 17:59.332
What a horrible dream.

17:59.334 --> 18:02.251
What's so horrible about it?

18:05.123 --> 18:07.906
Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.

18:07.908 --> 18:10.209
Still here.

18:12.380 --> 18:15.214
I can do this aaalll night.

18:19.085 --> 18:21.387
<i>Men...</i>

18:23.890 --> 18:25.941
Okay.

18:27.093 --> 18:30.780
How do we sell this?
Uh...

18:34.785 --> 18:36.485
911...

18:36.487 --> 18:38.437
911!

18:38.439 --> 18:41.624
Come on. You can
do better than that. Uh...

18:41.626 --> 18:42.958
Ah...

18:47.214 --> 18:49.448
Help me.

18:49.450 --> 18:50.716
Call 911.

18:51.586 --> 18:54.420
Am I dying
or taking a dump?

18:57.391 --> 18:58.974
Ah.

19:00.727 --> 19:04.230
Call 911...
Call 911...

19:04.232 --> 19:05.898
Yeah, that's it. Okay.

19:05.900 --> 19:09.134
Showtime.

19:12.489 --> 19:13.856
Alan...

19:13.858 --> 19:15.491
Don't, don't worry.
I'm not moving back in.

19:15.493 --> 19:17.109
I just forgot a few things.

19:17.111 --> 19:18.327
Yeah, like your son?

19:18.329 --> 19:20.513
Wait. Jake's here?

19:20.515 --> 19:21.914
Yeah, and his girlfriend.

19:21.916 --> 19:24.283
Ah,  you know,
damn that kid.

19:24.285 --> 19:27.486
I told him I was moving out and
he was not to come back here.

19:27.488 --> 19:29.738
But does he listen to me? No.

19:29.740 --> 19:32.842
You know, no one ever
listens to me and I...

19:36.046 --> 19:37.263
Call 911.

19:37.265 --> 19:38.964
Call 911.
Oh, no, not again.

19:38.966 --> 19:40.516
Hold on.
I'll get help.

19:42.519 --> 19:44.320
Son of a bitch.

19:45.889 --> 19:48.674
What's the matter?
Couldn't find a shark?

19:57.702 --> 19:59.136
<i>Men...</i>

19:59.138 --> 20:00.471
So, what do you think, Doc?

20:00.473 --> 20:02.539
We won't know until
we get all the tests back,

20:02.541 --> 20:04.625
but right now, his heart
appears to be perfectly fine.

20:04.627 --> 20:06.327
Thank God.

20:06.329 --> 20:07.846
So how long before
I can take him home?

20:07.871 --> 20:08.813
Walden?

20:08.814 --> 20:11.264
I am sorry, Zoey,
but I am not going to have

20:11.266 --> 20:13.534
this man's death
on my conscience.

20:19.074 --> 20:20.991
I'd like to thank the Academy.

20:24.329 --> 20:26.947
There are no small parts...

20:26.949 --> 20:28.882
only small apartments.

20:37.842 --> 20:39.893
I don't think you're allowed
to smoke in here.

20:39.895 --> 20:43.147
Does that include the joint
you just blew in the bathroom?

20:43.149 --> 20:45.232
How'd you know about that?

20:45.234 --> 20:47.568
Call it women's intuition,
taterhead.

20:47.570 --> 20:50.154
Whoa, the only person
that ever called me "taterhead"

20:50.156 --> 20:51.471
was my uncle Charlie.

20:51.473 --> 20:54.508
So, what does that
tell ya?

20:55.777 --> 20:57.477
I have no idea.

20:57.479 --> 21:00.981
Screw it.
I'm going back to hell.

21:03.918 --> 21:05.369
Ready, ladies?

21:05.371 --> 21:06.920
You bet.
We are.

21:06.922 --> 21:09.322
Then let's go.

21:09.324 --> 21:12.710
And me with with just a nutsack.
