10:34.880 --> 10:37.380

18:20.930 --> 18:23.310
[JAKE] THAT'S RIGHT.
DOUG'S THE SON PART.

18:23.350 --> 18:25.680
[HALLIDAY] WOULDN'T KNOW HIM.
MAYBE BY FACE.

18:25.730 --> 18:26.690
[MALACHY] FUNNY,

18:26.730 --> 18:28.310
CAUSE YOU SOLD HIM
WHAT LOOKS LIKE

18:28.350 --> 18:31.400
5 KILOS OF SAUSAGE THIS MORNING
FOR 78 CENTS.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.480
THAT'S A PRETTY FRIENDLY RATE.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.320
[HALLIDAY] SLIP OF THE FINGER.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.320
[JAKE] IT'S A HARD OLD
PROFESSION TO BE AT THAT.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.490
[HALLIDAY] YEAH.
[MALACHY] FAIR ENOUGH.

18:39.530 --> 18:42.530
[HALLIDAY] WELL, GOOD LUCK
GENTLEMEN.

18:47.370 --> 18:49.330
[MALACHY] GOOD BUTCHER...

18:49.370 --> 18:50.170
DECENT LIAR.

18:50.210 --> 18:52.210
[JAKE] LET'S KEEP
AN EYE ON THAT.

18:54.460 --> 18:56.420
[DWAYNE] BABY
I'VE BEEN MESSED UP.

18:56.470 --> 18:57.970
[TINNY] OH, YEAH?

18:58.010 --> 18:59.220
HOW MESSED UP?

18:59.260 --> 19:00.800
[DWAYNE] I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I DID WRONG, OKAY?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.680
BUT I'LL DO ANYTHING TO FIX IT,
OKAY? ANYTHING.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.890
YOU JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO
AND I CAN CHANGE.

19:04.930 --> 19:07.100
[TINNY] THIS IS GETTING REALLY
UNATTRACTIVE.

19:07.140 --> 19:08.060
[DWAYNE] I'M SORRY.

19:08.100 --> 19:11.150
I'M SORRY.
LET ME START OVER.

19:11.190 --> 19:12.190
[TINNY] DID YOU HEAR ABOUT

19:12.230 --> 19:15.440
"HALF SKEETY PALMETER'S"
PARTY OUT IN KILBRIDE TONIGHT?

19:15.480 --> 19:17.690
[DWAYNE] NO.

19:17.740 --> 19:18.320
OH YES!

19:18.360 --> 19:19.400
SKEETY PALMATER'S PARTY.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.110
YEAH.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.030
[TINNY] HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

19:22.070 --> 19:25.290
[DWAYNE] I TOOK MY UNCLE'S
CHEVELLE.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.330
YOU CAN DRIVE IT IF YOU WANT.

19:28.830 --> 19:32.330
[TINNY] OKAY.
[DWAYNE] OKAY, WHAT?

19:32.380 --> 19:34.380
[TINNY] OKAY, WE'LL GO.

19:36.420 --> 19:40.050
JUST NO CRYING, OKAY?

19:41.970 --> 19:43.760
[JAKE] WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.470
[MALACHY] YOU GOT A LEAD
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

19:45.510 --> 19:47.390
[JAKE] OKAY.

19:47.430 --> 19:49.980
BUT IF DOUG'S HEAD END
UP AT OUR DOOR STEP,
YOU CAN BE THE ONE TO TELL MARY

19:50.020 --> 19:53.020
THAT WE WERE SITTING AROUND ALL
DAY IN FRONT OF A MEAT MARKET.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.280
[MALACHY] OH.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.320
THIS LOOKS PROMISING.

20:01.820 --> 20:05.200
&lt;♪♪&gt;

20:05.240 --> 20:06.580
[JAKE] WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE GROCERIES?

20:06.620 --> 20:09.620
&lt;♪♪&gt;

20:22.970 --> 20:28.430
[JAKE] LET'S GO TAKE A PEAK?
[CHRISTIAN] I LIED.

20:28.470 --> 20:30.350
I WASN'T THERE TO SEE AN OLD
COLLEAGUE.

20:30.390 --> 20:31.350
[LESLIE] I FIGURED THAT.

20:31.390 --> 20:32.350
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

20:32.390 --> 20:34.900
[CHRISTIAN] OH, I HAVE MY WAYS.

20:34.940 --> 20:38.320
[LESLIE] LAWYERS ALWAYS DO.
[CHRISTIAN] YEAH, THEY DO.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.190
LOOK AT THAT VIEW.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.490
I LOVE THIS TOWN.

20:41.530 --> 20:46.280
[LESLIE] WHY DID YOU LEAVE?
[CHRISTIAN] I ALMOST DIDN'T.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.620
MY LIFE WAS THIS CLOSE TO
BEING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

20:48.660 --> 20:52.870
[LESLIE] HOW'S THAT?
[CHRISTIAN] FAMILY STUFF.

20:52.910 --> 20:57.210
I HAD A DEAL TO OPEN UP A BAR
WITH MY BROTHER. IT WAS ALL

20:57.250 --> 21:00.340
READY TO GO, BUT AT THE LAST
MINUTE I GOT CLAUSTROPHOBIC

21:00.380 --> 21:03.050
AND PANICKED. TOOK ALL THE
MONEY I WAS GONNA INVEST IN

21:03.090 --> 21:05.180
THE BAR AND HOPPED ON A PLANE.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.050
[LESLIE] OH REALLY?

21:07.100 --> 21:11.390
SO LET'S SEE YOU'RE IMPULSIVE,
UNRELIABLE, UNTRUSTWORTHY

21:11.430 --> 21:13.730
WITH NO REGARD FOR FAMILY.

21:13.770 --> 21:17.520
[CHRISTIAN] AND THOSE ARE
MY GOOD TRAITS.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.520
WAIT TILL I SHOW YOU
THE BAD ONES.

21:19.570 --> 21:20.940
[LESLIE] I SHOULD...

21:20.980 --> 21:22.360
I SHOULD BE HEADING BACK.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.570
[CHRISTIAN] I'M NOT DONE
WITH YOU.

21:23.610 --> 21:27.200
WHAT TIME YOU OFF SERGEANT?

21:27.240 --> 21:30.490
[JAKE] WELL IF THEY'RE
KEEPING DOUG HERE,

21:30.540 --> 21:33.500
THEY MUST BE FEEDING HIM WELL
WITH ALL THOSE GROCERIES.

21:33.540 --> 21:36.540
&lt;♪♪&gt;

21:40.550 --> 21:41.760
[JAKE] IT'S OPEN.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.800
&lt;♪♪&gt;

21:47.140 --> 21:48.890
[JAKE] JUST KEEP AN EYE.

21:48.930 --> 21:51.470
MAKE SURE THE BUTCHER
DOESN'T COME BACK, ALRIGHT?

21:51.520 --> 21:52.890
[MALACHY] BE CAREFUL.

21:52.930 --> 21:55.940
&lt;♪♪&gt;

22:15.080 --> 22:17.540
[JAKE] HELLO THERE FELLER?

22:17.580 --> 22:19.380
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

22:19.420 --> 22:21.420
MY NAME IS JAKE DOYLE.

22:29.850 --> 22:34.850
WELL HELLO SWISS FRANK,
NICE TO MEET YA.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.060
[JAKE] ALRIGHT,
LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

22:40.110 --> 22:41.270
HOW DO YOU KNOW DOUG PUDDISTER?

22:41.310 --> 22:42.690
[HALLIDAY] I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T KNOW HIM.

22:42.730 --> 22:45.070
[MALACHY] OKAY THEN,
HOW DO YOU KNOW SWISS FRANK?

22:45.110 --> 22:48.490
[JAKE] WE GOT PICTURES OF HIM
IF YOU LIKE. SOME OF THEM HE'S

22:48.530 --> 22:50.660
EATING LETTUCE. HE'S REALLY
PARTIAL TO THE CARROTS. JURY

22:50.700 --> 22:53.330
IS STILL OUT ON THE SAUSAGE.
[MALACHY] HORSES TEND NOT TO

22:53.370 --> 22:55.450
APPRECIATE MOOSE, LIKE THE
REST OF US.

22:55.500 --> 22:59.080
[HALLIDAY] OKAY, I USED TO
MOONLIGHT DOWN AT PUDDISTER'S,

22:59.120 --> 23:00.580
SORTING ROPE.

23:00.620 --> 23:03.300
AND ANY TIME THAT DOUG AND THE
OLD MAN, THEY'D GET INTO A

23:03.340 --> 23:05.550
FIGHT, HE'D END UP DOWN
AT THE WAREHOUSE SORTING ROPE

23:05.590 --> 23:08.760
WITH ME. THAT'S HOW I GOT TO
KNOW HIM, OKAY?

23:08.800 --> 23:11.680
[MALACHY] SO, HOW DID YOU COME
INTO POSSESSION OF THAT HORSE?

23:11.720 --> 23:12.890
[HALLIDAY] I DIDN'T.

23:12.930 --> 23:14.180
DOUG DID.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.140
AND BESIDES, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE GOT IT AND

23:16.180 --> 23:18.520
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE GOT IT.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.020
[JAKE] YOU DIDN'T THINK TO ASK?

23:20.060 --> 23:22.480
[HALLIDAY] HE JUST CALLS ME
UP, OUT OF THE BLUE AND SAYS

23:22.520 --> 23:25.480
HE'LL PAY ME IF I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE HORSE, DOWN THE ROAD.

23:25.530 --> 23:28.530
SO I SAYS, "OKAY, YES BOY",
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID.

23:28.570 --> 23:33.580
I JUST KEPT BUDDY HEALTHY
AND FED.

23:33.620 --> 23:40.040
I THOUGHT IT WAS A WEDDING
PRESENT.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.460
[ROSE] MALACHY?
[MALACHY] MHMM?

23:41.500 --> 23:43.340
[ROSE] YOUR BUDDY SWISS FRANK
IS A BIT OF A CELEBRITY.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.590
[MALACHY] IS THAT RIGHT?
[ROSE] YES, HE COMES FROM A

23:45.630 --> 23:48.510
LONG LINE OF HALL OF FAME
HORSES. SIRED IN IRELAND BUT

23:48.550 --> 23:51.590
HE WAS CONSIDERED A DUD SO
THEY SOLD HIM OFF OVERSEAS.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.600
[MALACHY] WONDER IF IT'S NOT
TOO LATE FOR ME TO TRY THAT.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.850
[ROSE] OKAY, SOMEHOW HE WOUND
UP IN THE RAINBOW STABLES OUT

23:55.890 --> 23:57.180
NEAR THE GOULDS TRACK.

23:57.220 --> 23:58.770
BUT HE'S DESTINED FOR A CAREER

23:58.810 --> 24:01.850
OF OBSCURITY, SHOCKS EVERYBODY
WHEN HE STARTED WINNING RACES.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.230
BIG, BIG RACES.

24:03.270 --> 24:04.610
THEY SAY HE'S WORTH OVER
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT

24:04.650 --> 24:05.320
NOW.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.610
[JAKE] NEVER COUNT OUT A DUD.

24:06.650 --> 24:08.110
[ROSE] AND THE BEST PART?

24:08.150 --> 24:10.490
GUESS WHO THE OWNER OF
SWISS FRANK IS?

24:10.530 --> 24:14.410
[MALACHY] OH, DO TELL.
[ROSE] CORDAGE MAGNATE
K.C. PUDDISTER.

24:14.450 --> 24:16.660
[MALACHY] REALLY?
[ROSE] MHMM.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.120
YUP!

24:18.160 --> 24:19.540
[JAKE] I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

24:20.710 --> 24:23.040
[JAKE] CAREFUL,
MIGHT RUIN YOUR SUPPER.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.040
[CHRISTIAN] I'M SKIPPING SUPPER.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.500
I GOT ME A HOT DATE LATER.

24:25.540 --> 24:27.590
[JAKE] REALLY? WHO'S
THE LUCKY "CRAIGSLIST" ESCORT?

24:27.630 --> 24:28.590
[CHRISTIAN] FUNNY.

24:28.630 --> 24:29.880
SHE'S SOME FOXY,
YOU'D LIKE HER.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.260
I'LL CHECK IF SHE'S GOT
A SISTER.

24:31.300 --> 24:33.680
[JAKE] APPRECIATE THAT.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.510
SO...

24:35.550 --> 24:37.510
HOW WAS REHAB, BROTHER?

24:37.560 --> 24:40.060
[CHRISTIAN] HOW DID YOU HEAR
ABOUT THAT?

24:40.100 --> 24:41.480
[JAKE] I GOT MY WAYS.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.060
[CHRISTIAN] KEEPING TABS ON
YOUR BIG BROTHER, HUH?

24:43.100 --> 24:44.150
[JAKE] ALL BETTER NOW, ARE WE?

24:44.190 --> 24:45.900
[CHRISTIAN] IT'S AN
ONGOING PROCESS.

24:45.940 --> 24:49.030
WHILE WE'RE ON THE TOPIC,
SOMETHING I NEED TO
GET OFF MY CHEST.

24:49.070 --> 24:50.690
HAS TO DO WITH OUR BAR.

24:50.740 --> 24:51.860
[JAKE] I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D BRING IT UP.

24:51.900 --> 24:53.700
[CHRISTIAN] I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.

24:53.740 --> 24:54.700
[JAKE] AN APOLOGY?

24:54.740 --> 24:57.120
[CHRISTIAN] THIS IS
A PART OF THE PROCESS.

24:58.830 --> 25:02.750
JAKE...

25:02.790 --> 25:04.580
I'M SORRY.

25:04.620 --> 25:05.830
[JAKE] UNBELIEVABLE.
[CHRISTIAN] WHAT?

25:05.880 --> 25:07.170
[JAKE] I DON'T WANT AN APOLOGY!

25:07.210 --> 25:08.710
I WANT 4000 DOLLARS!

25:08.750 --> 25:10.590
[CHRISTIAN] WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:10.630 --> 25:12.720
[JAKE] I INVESTED
4000 DOLLARS ON THAT BAR,

25:12.760 --> 25:13.880
AND IT ALL DISAPPEARED

25:13.930 --> 25:16.050
WHEN YOU DECIDED TO RUN AWAY
FROM HOME LIKE A TEENAGE GIRL.

25:16.090 --> 25:17.050
[CHRISTIAN] OH, 4000 DOLLARS.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.100
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
SO CROOKED ABOUT?

25:19.140 --> 25:20.310
[JAKE] WHAT ELSE WOULD IT BE?

25:20.350 --> 25:21.680
[CHRISTIAN] YOU DIDN'T
TALK TO ME FOR YEARS

25:21.730 --> 25:24.600
BECAUSE OF FOUR GRAND. GOD
YOU ARE SOME STUBBORN.

25:24.640 --> 25:28.270
[JAKE] 4000 DOLLARS IS A LOT OF
MONEY FOR SOME PEOPLE, OKAY?

25:28.320 --> 25:30.940
WHY DO YOU THINK I'M STUCK
LIVING WITH THE OLD MAN?

25:30.980 --> 25:32.360
[CHRISTIAN] HOLD UP,
LEMME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.360
YOU'RE BLAMING ME FOR THE FACT
THAT YOU LIVE HERE WITH DAD?

25:34.400 --> 25:36.200
[JAKE] NOT TO MENTION THE
STRAIN IT PUT ON MY MARRIAGE.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.870
[CHRISTIAN] AND I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE DISSOLUTION
OF YOUR MARRIAGE.

25:38.910 --> 25:40.870
[JAKE] PARTIALLY.
SORT OF.
MAYBE.

25:40.910 --> 25:45.250
[CHRISTIAN] WELL, I'LL
"SORT OF, PARTIALLY,
MAYBE" PAY YOU BACK SOME DAY.

25:45.290 --> 25:46.370
[JAKE] I WANT THAT MONEY.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.750
[CHRISTIAN] YOU WANNA
FIGHT ME FOR IT?

25:48.790 --> 25:51.590
[LESLIE] YES, THIS IS
SERGEANT BENNETT OF THE ROYAL
NEWFOUNDLAND CONSTABULARY.

25:51.630 --> 25:54.670
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
HELP ME TRACK DOWN A
MEMBER OF YOUR FIRM.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.930
[WOMAN] CERTAINLY,
WHAT IS THIS REGARDING?

25:56.970 --> 26:00.260
[LESLIE] IT INVOLVES A SENSITIVE
CASE HERE IN ST. JOHN'S.

26:00.310 --> 26:03.350
A LAWYER BY THE NAME OF
CHRISTIAN...

26:03.390 --> 26:06.730
[WOMAN] DO YOU MEAN
CHRISTIAN DOYLE?

26:06.770 --> 26:09.810
[LESLIE] CHRISTIAN... DOYLE.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.480
THAT SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.900
[WOMAN] MR. DOYLE IS
NO LONGER AN EMPLOYEE OF
BARTLETT &amp; MORGAN.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.240
[LESLIE] OH, HE ISN'T?

26:15.280 --> 26:17.990
[WOMAN] HIS CONTRACT WAS
TERMINATED SOME TIME AGO.

26:19.700 --> 26:21.240
[JAKE] SO...

26:21.280 --> 26:23.700
THE NAME SWISS FRANK
DIDN'T RING ANY BELLS FOR YA,
HUH?

26:23.750 --> 26:26.120
[K.C.] HEY, I OWN A LOT OF
HORSES.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.580
[JAKE] OKAY, WE ARE
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

26:28.630 --> 26:31.840
IF YOU WANT YOUR SON TO LIVE,
START TELLING ME THE TRUTH
RIGHT NOW.

26:31.880 --> 26:33.960
[K.C.] LAST WEEK
I RECEIVED A NOTE.

26:34.010 --> 26:35.840
CLAIMING MY HORSE WAS KIDNAPPED

26:35.880 --> 26:37.630
AND THEY WANTED
50 THOUSAND DOLLARS OR

26:37.680 --> 26:39.720
SWISS FRANK WILL WIND UP IN
THE GLUE FACTORY.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.260
[JAKE] YOU SEE, THAT WOULD
HAVE BEEN HELPFUL INFORMATION

26:41.300 --> 26:42.140
A COUPLE HOURS AGO.

26:42.180 --> 26:43.180
WHY WOULD YOU KEEP IT A SECRET?

26:43.220 --> 26:45.640
[K.C.] BECAUSE I'M IN THE
PROCESS OF SELLING THE HORSE.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.560
FOR A VERY NICE AMOUNT.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.940
IF WORD OF THE KIDNAPPED
LEAKED, IT WOULD'VE
JEOPARDIZED THE SALE.

26:50.980 --> 26:53.440
[JAKE] BUT YOUR SON'S LIFE
IS NOT IMPORTANT TO YA?

26:53.480 --> 26:56.490
[K.C.] IT WAS DOUG
WHO SENT THE NOTE.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.570
[JAKE] SORRY?
[K.C.] MY SON HAS SOME
CHALLENGES.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.990
[JAKE] CHALLENGES?
[K.C] THE RANSOM LETTER
WAS ON MY STATIONARY.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.410
[JAKE] WHY WOULD YOUR OWN SON
KIDNAP YOUR HORSE?

27:06.450 --> 27:08.210
[K.C] HE'S BEEN ANGRY WITH ME
FOR MONTHS.

27:08.250 --> 27:13.290
TRYING TO GET REVENGE.
I DIDN'T RSVP TO HIS WEDDING.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.960
I REMARRIED LAST SPRING.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.760
DOUG DOESN'T MUCH LIKE
MY NEW WIFE.

27:16.800 --> 27:20.430
HE DIDN'T COME TO MY WEDDING.
WHY SHOULD I GO TO HIS?

27:20.470 --> 27:21.850
[JAKE] UNBELIEVABLE.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.770
[CHRISTIAN] LOOK AT YOU.

27:27.890 --> 27:30.400
[LESLIE] CHRISTIAN,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CANCEL.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.230
[CHRISTIAN] OH. WHY IS THAT?

27:32.270 --> 27:34.520
[LESLIE] THAT LITTLE BROTHER
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT...

27:34.570 --> 27:36.780
HIS NAME DOESN'T HAPPEN
TO BE "JAKE", DOES IT?

27:36.820 --> 27:38.780
[CHRISTIAN] MIGHT BE.
[LESLIE] LOOK CHRISTIAN,

27:38.820 --> 27:41.660
YOUR BROTHER AND I,
WE HAVE HISTORY.

27:41.700 --> 27:42.910
I'M SORRY, WE CAN'T DO THIS.

27:42.950 --> 27:46.660
[CHRISTIAN] JAKE AND YOU?
[LESLIE] YES, SMALL WORLD.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.410
[CHRISTIAN] FORGET JAKE.

27:48.460 --> 27:49.330
WHAT'S PAST IS PAST.

27:49.370 --> 27:50.250
DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

27:50.290 --> 27:52.330
[LESLIE] WELL IT BOTHERS ME.

27:52.380 --> 27:55.460
I'VE ALREADY BEEN DOWN
DOYLE'S ROAD AND TRUST ME,

27:55.500 --> 27:56.630
IT'S A DEAD END.

27:56.670 --> 27:58.130
[CHRISTIAN] I'M NOTHING LIKE
MY BROTHER.

27:58.170 --> 28:00.800
[LESLIE] I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT
THAT.

28:00.840 --> 28:05.930
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

28:05.970 --> 28:07.970
[CHRISTIAN] HAVE YOU GOT
A YOUNGER SISTER?

28:08.020 --> 28:10.770
MAYBE I SHOULD MAKE OUT WITH
HER. CALL IT EVEN.

28:10.810 --> 28:13.400
[LESLIE] GOOD BYE, MAINLAND.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.980
[CHRISTIAN] THIS DOESN'T
SEEM FAIR!

28:15.020 --> 28:18.650
[LESLIE] YOU SEEM LIKE
A SURVIVOR! YOU'LL WORK IT OUT!

28:23.200 --> 28:25.830
[MARY] JAKE, WE'RE OUT
OF TIME. WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:25.870 --> 28:27.620
HAVE YOU GUYS FIGURED
ANYTHING OUT YET?

28:27.660 --> 28:29.750
[JAKE] WELL THERE IS A THEORY.

28:29.790 --> 28:32.960
[MARY] WHAT KIND OF THEORY?
[JAKE] WELL WE THINK THAT

28:33.000 --> 28:36.630
MAYBE, POSSIBLY...

28:36.670 --> 28:38.550
DOUG KIDNAPPED HIMSELF.

28:38.590 --> 28:39.800
[MARY] WHAT?!

28:39.840 --> 28:40.920
[JAKE] YEAH.

28:40.960 --> 28:44.300
HE STOLE HIS FATHER'S HORSE
LAST WEEK.

28:44.340 --> 28:45.640
YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?

28:45.680 --> 28:47.050
[MARY] NO.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.930
NO THAT'S RIDICULOUS,
BECAUSE LAST WEEK DOUG WAS ON

28:48.970 --> 28:52.140
WOODY ISLAND FOR THE STAG
PARTY.

28:52.190 --> 28:53.940
[JAKE] WAS HE?

28:53.980 --> 28:56.020
BECAUSE WE'RE PRETTY SURE HE
STOLE THE HORSE.

28:56.060 --> 28:59.860
THEN DIDN'T GET THE RANSOM
HE WANTED FROM HIS OLD MAN,

28:59.900 --> 29:01.400
SO HE KIDNAPPED HIMSELF.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.860
MAYBE.
[MARY] WHY WOULD HE DO THAT

29:03.910 --> 29:04.910
TO US?

29:04.950 --> 29:07.580
&lt;K.C'S PHONE RINGS&gt;
[JAKE] OKAY, JUST WAIT.

29:07.620 --> 29:08.280
LET ME GET IT.

29:08.330 --> 29:10.290
DES?

29:10.330 --> 29:13.830
[JAKE] SHH!

29:13.870 --> 29:14.750
[JAKE] HELLO?

29:14.790 --> 29:15.920
[KIDNAPPER] WHO IS THIS?

29:15.960 --> 29:17.540
[JAKE] THIS IS...

29:17.590 --> 29:18.590
THE BEST MAN.

29:18.630 --> 29:19.840
WHO'S THIS?

29:19.880 --> 29:22.090
[KIDNAPPER] PUT MR. PUDDISTER
BACK ON THE PHONE.

29:22.130 --> 29:24.130
[JAKE] WHY DON'T YOU PUT DOUG
BACK ON THE PHONE?

29:24.180 --> 29:25.840
[KIDNAPPER] IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW
INSTRUCTIONS,

29:25.890 --> 29:27.010
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET IT.

29:27.050 --> 29:29.060
[JAKE] DOUG, IS THIS YOU?

29:32.810 --> 29:33.810
[DES] OW! WHAT THE HELL?

29:33.850 --> 29:37.860
[JAKE] LOOK
JUST EVERYONE RELAX.

29:37.900 --> 29:39.190
[JAKE] WHOA!

29:39.230 --> 29:40.940
[DES] WHAT'S THAT A SAUSAGE
OR SOMETHING?

29:40.980 --> 29:42.990
[MARY] NO, THAT'S HIS RING
FINGER JAKE.

29:43.030 --> 29:44.780
THAT'S DOUGGY'S RING FINGER!

29:47.030 --> 29:49.780
&lt;♪♪&gt;

29:56.040 --> 29:57.790
&lt;K.C'S PHONE RINGS&gt;

29:59.750 --> 30:00.880
[K.C.] HELLO? HELLO?

30:00.920 --> 30:01.710
[KIDNAPPER] DID YOU
RECEIVE THE MESSAGE?

30:01.750 --> 30:03.800
[K.C.] YES, YES. WE'RE SORRY.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.760
[KIDNAPPER] IF YOU WANNA SEE
YOUR SON ALIVE AGAIN,

30:05.800 --> 30:09.010
AT 6 AM DRIVE TO THE TOP OF
MOUNT SIO.

30:09.050 --> 30:10.260
YOU AND YOU ALONE.

30:10.310 --> 30:11.220
WE WILL BE WATCHING.

30:11.260 --> 30:15.480
WAIT THERE FOR FURTHER
INSTRUCTIONS.

30:15.520 --> 30:17.100
[DES] WHAT DID THEY SAY?

30:17.150 --> 30:18.060
OH GOD!

30:18.100 --> 30:19.980
OH JE--!

30:20.020 --> 30:21.900
[NIKKI/CHRISTIAN] &lt;LAUGHING&gt;
[NIKKI] AND TO THIS DAY, JAKE

30:21.940 --> 30:24.650
STILL DENIES THAT THERE WAS A
STRIPPER AT HIS STAG.

30:24.690 --> 30:26.070
[CHRISTIAN] "RAVEN" WAS HER
NAME.

30:26.110 --> 30:27.240
SHE'S A NICE OLD GAL.

30:27.280 --> 30:28.870
HEY WALTER AND HER WENT ON
TO DATE FOR 3 MONTHS.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.200
[NIKKI] OH YEAH?

30:30.240 --> 30:31.660
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL JAKE ON
THAT ONE.

30:31.700 --> 30:33.870
[CHRISTIAN] NAH, HE NEVER EVEN
LAID EYES ON HER.

30:33.910 --> 30:36.210
HE WAS SO HAMMERED BY THE
TIME SHE ROLLED UP TO THE

30:36.250 --> 30:38.540
CABIN, HE HAD ALREADY WANDERED
OFF. I FOUND HIM TWO MILES DOWN

30:38.580 --> 30:40.460
THE ROAD, PASSED OUT IN A
PAY-PHONE.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.920
[NIKKI] OH MY GOD.
WHAT WAS HE DOING?

30:41.960 --> 30:44.010
[CHRISTIAN] WELL,
HE WAS TRYING TO CALL YOU.

30:44.050 --> 30:47.930
BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE A QUARTER.

30:47.970 --> 30:49.970
TELL YOU THE TRUTH...

30:51.970 --> 30:53.220
I WAS REALLY...

30:53.260 --> 30:56.060
SHOCKED WHEN I HEARD
YOU GUYS CALLED IT QUITS.

30:56.100 --> 30:58.440
[NIKKI] YEAH. WELL...
YOU KNOW.

30:58.480 --> 31:00.060
[CHRISTIAN] I SHOULD HAVE
ASKED YOU OUT FIRST.

31:00.100 --> 31:03.230
[NIKKI] &lt;LAUGHS&gt;
[NIKKI] RIGHT, ANYWAY, SO...

31:03.270 --> 31:06.030
YOU AND JAKE,
HAVE YOU GUYS RECONCILED?
ARE YOU--

31:06.070 --> 31:07.320
[CHRISTIAN] OH YEAH.
IMMEDIATELY.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.700
HE APOLOGIZED, I FORGAVE HIM.

31:09.740 --> 31:10.820
IT'S LIKE WE'RE KIDS AGAIN.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.240
[NIKKI] THAT IS REALLY GOOD.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.370
I'M VERY RELIVED TO HEAR THAT,
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

31:13.410 --> 31:14.240
I MEAN...

31:14.280 --> 31:15.660
[CHRISTIAN] YOU KNOW HOW HE IS.

31:15.700 --> 31:16.870
HE PUTS UP A TOUGH FRONT.

31:16.910 --> 31:18.080
[NIKKI] DO I EVER!

31:18.120 --> 31:19.670
[INTERCOM] DR. REYNOLDS,
CALL 47--

31:19.710 --> 31:21.330
[NIKKI] IT WAS REALLY GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.460
[CHRISTIAN] YEAH,
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[NIKKI] OKAY, SEE YOU SOON.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.880
&lt;♪♪&gt;

31:38.310 --> 31:39.890
[JAKE] WHERE IS DAD?

31:39.940 --> 31:41.480
[ROSE] IN BED,
WHERE I SHOULD BE.

31:41.520 --> 31:44.270
I LOOKED IN TO THE SALE
OF SWISS FRANK.

31:44.320 --> 31:47.030
HE WAS BOUGHT BY A NUMBERED
COMPANY IN THE BAHAMAS.

31:47.070 --> 31:48.400
[JAKE] THAT'S ODD.
[ROSE] BUT THAT NUMBERED COMPANY

31:48.440 --> 31:50.950
ALSO HAPPENS TO BE
THE MAJOR SUPPLIER TO

31:50.990 --> 31:52.990
A WHOLE STRING OF COUNTRY BARS
AROUND THE BAY.

31:53.030 --> 31:55.910
[JAKE] WHY DO I GET THE
FEELING THAT YOU'VE DISCOVERED
SOMETHING INTERESTING?

31:55.950 --> 31:58.120
[ROSE] I FOUND OUT THAT
THOSE COUNTRY BARS,

31:58.160 --> 31:59.620
ARE OWNED BY
THE DUDE IN THAT FILE,

31:59.660 --> 32:02.630
RENÉ CALLAGHAN ST. JULES.

32:02.670 --> 32:03.790
[JAKE] HUH.

32:03.830 --> 32:06.420
WAS HE A HORSE ENTHUSIAST
OR SOMETHING?

32:06.460 --> 32:07.630
[ROSE] YUP.

32:07.670 --> 32:09.380
AND COCAINE TRAFFICKING.

32:09.420 --> 32:10.550
[JAKE] HUH.

32:10.590 --> 32:11.930
WHAT DID YOU SAY HIS NAME WAS?

32:11.970 --> 32:15.720
[ROSE] RENÉ CALLAGHAN
ST. JULES.

32:15.760 --> 32:19.180
[JAKE] SO THIS ST. JULES BUYS
THE HORSE FROM K.C. PUDDISTER.

32:19.230 --> 32:22.690
THEN K.C PUDDISTER'S SON
KIDNAPS THE HORSE SO ST. JULES

32:22.730 --> 32:24.900
KIDNAPS K.C'S SON FOR THE HORSE.

32:24.940 --> 32:27.940
[ROSE] YEAH.

32:29.570 --> 32:33.530

WHY WOULD YOU SLAP ME?
[TINNY] I DON'T KNOW!

32:51.090 --> 32:52.430
[CLAIRE] IS THAT YOUR
GIRLFRIEND?

32:52.470 --> 32:53.800

[JAKE] K.C? YOU READY TO GO?

33:10.440 --> 33:11.900
[K.C.] I DON'T FEEL GOOD
ABOUT THIS.

33:11.940 --> 33:15.110
[JAKE] DON'T WORRY, WE'LL GET
DOUG BACK SAFE AND SOUND.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.820
[K.C.] HOW DO I KNOW THAT?

33:16.870 --> 33:20.040
I COULD VERY WELL JUST
BE GIVING AWAY A MILLION
DOLLAR HORSE HERE.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.120
[JAKE] JUST...

33:21.160 --> 33:25.330
STAY COOL, AND
FOLLOW THE PLAN ALRIGHT?

33:25.370 --> 33:27.170

33:27.210 --> 33:30.210
&lt;JAKE'S PHONE RINGS&gt;

33:33.300 --> 33:35.010

33:35.050 --> 33:38.010
[NIKKI] THANKS FOR THE FINGER.
ALL OUT OF ROSES WERE THEY?

33:38.050 --> 33:40.010
[JAKE] OH, YEAH.
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT?

33:40.060 --> 33:41.720
[NIKKI] NOT MUCH.

33:41.770 --> 33:45.230
BUT EVER KNIFE WAS USED
TO CUT IT OFF HAD
A STRANGE CURVE TO IT.

33:45.270 --> 33:47.150
[JAKE] STRANGE, HOW?
[NIKKI] STRANGE CURVED.

33:47.190 --> 33:48.190

ENOUGH FOR YOU?

33:48.230 --> 33:49.190
[JAKE] OKAY, WHATEVER. LOOK,

33:56.860 --> 33:58.410
[JAKE] IS THAT A TRICK
QUESTION?

33:58.450 --> 33:59.830
[NIKKI] MAYBE IT'S NOTHING

33:59.870 --> 34:01.790

CALL AN AMBULANCE.

35:57.110 --> 35:58.650
[JAKE] MARY...

35:58.690 --> 36:01.280
THINGS DIDN'T GO EXACTLY
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

36:01.320 --> 36:04.240
[MARY] YOU DIDN'T BRING HIM
BACK TO ME?

36:04.280 --> 36:05.450
[JAKE] NO I'M SORRY.

36:05.490 --> 36:07.330
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF
ANY KIDNAPPERS.

36:07.370 --> 36:11.000
BUT EVERY COP IN TOWN IS
ON THE HUNT FOR THIS
RENÉ ST. JULES CHARACTER.

36:11.040 --> 36:13.040

36:39.280 --> 36:42.410
[WALTER] YEAH. LAST NIGHT
SHE MADE UP A LIST

36:42.450 --> 36:45.950
OF EVERY BAD THING SHE EVER
DID IN HER WHOLE LIFE.

36:45.990 --> 36:48.870
SHE WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT SHE DID TO DESERVE THIS.

36:48.910 --> 36:50.290
[JAKE] I WAS ON THE BAD LIST?

36:50.330 --> 36:52.160
[WALTER] YEAH. YOU AFTER
STEALING WINE FROM THE CHURCH,

36:52.210 --> 36:54.460
AND BEFORE RUNNING OVER
THE NEIGHBOUR'S CAT.

36:54.500 --> 36:57.250
[JAKE] OKAY YOUR OBSESSION
WITH THIS, IT'S UNHEALTHY,

36:57.290 --> 37:00.460
OKAY? SHE IS YOUR SISTER,
SHE IS NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

37:00.510 --> 37:03.340
[WALTER] I KNOW.

37:03.380 --> 37:05.010
YOU'RE FIRED.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.220
[MALACHY] NICE ONE.

37:13.060 --> 37:14.940
[MALACHY] WAS CHRISTIAN IN HERE?

37:14.980 --> 37:16.310
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BACK
FOR DINNER.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.070
[JAKE] WELL, I WOULDN'T HOLD
YOUR BREATH, OLD MAN.

37:18.110 --> 37:19.530
THAT CHRISTIAN DOYLE
IS A BUSY BOY.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.570
[MALACHY] YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU
WANNA SAY ABOUT YOUR BROTHER?

37:24.660 --> 37:25.990
[JAKE] NO.

37:26.030 --> 37:28.700
[MALACHY] JAKE, I KNOW
EVERYTHING. I'M NOT STUPID.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.700
[JAKE] WHAT IS "EVERYTHING",
EXACTLY?

37:30.750 --> 37:32.660
[MALACHY] WHO DO YOU THINK
PICKED HIM UP FROM REHAB?

37:32.710 --> 37:36.080
WHO DO YOU THINK CHECKED HIM
OUT AND BROUGHT HIM HOME?

37:36.130 --> 37:38.340
[JAKE] I'M SORRY, I JUST...

37:38.380 --> 37:40.210
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WERE BUYING
IN TO ALL OF HIS CRAP,

37:40.250 --> 37:41.670
YOU KNOW?

37:41.710 --> 37:42.880
[MALACHY] LOOK, WE ALL KNOW
YOUR BROTHER HAS PROBLEMS.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.880
BUT HE'S GETTING BETTER NOW.

37:44.930 --> 37:45.720
[JAKE] BETTER?

37:45.760 --> 37:46.430
REALLY?

37:46.470 --> 37:47.850
[MALACHY] HE'S DOING HIS BEST.

37:47.890 --> 37:51.930
POINT IS HE'S HOME, AND NOW HE
KNOWS WE'RE HERE FOR HIM.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.640
MOST OF US AT LEAST.

37:54.690 --> 37:57.100
JAKE, YOU ONLY GOT ONE BROTHER.

37:57.150 --> 37:58.520
REMEMBER THAT.

38:05.910 --> 38:08.910
&lt;♪♪&gt;

38:22.550 --> 38:25.420
[EMILY] BEAUTIFUL WEDDING.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.470
[JAKE] IT'S TOO BAD YOU
COULDN'T BE HERE TO SEE IT.

38:27.510 --> 38:30.510
[EMILY] IT'S TOO BAD THIS IS
NOT GONNA WORK OUT.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.390
[JAKE] I'M SORRY.

38:34.430 --> 38:35.680
I TRIED.

38:35.730 --> 38:36.940
[EMILY] NO.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.480
YOU DIDN'T.

38:38.520 --> 38:42.980
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS WANTED YOU
TO HAVE A LITTLE GIRL,

38:43.030 --> 38:46.450
AND A STABLE TO KEEP
YOUR HORSE IN.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.960
&lt;♪♪&gt;

39:04.170 --> 39:05.630
[TINNY] HEY NICE HORSE.

39:05.670 --> 39:07.300
[DAUGHTER] THANKS.

39:08.510 --> 39:10.220
[TINNY] WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIS FOOT?

39:10.260 --> 39:11.510
[DAUGHTER] HE HAD AN ACCIDENT.

39:11.550 --> 39:17.980
THEY SAY HE CAN'T RACE NO MORE,
BUT I STILL LOVE HIM.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.230
[TINNY] WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THAT?

39:19.270 --> 39:20.600
[DAUGHTER] CLEAN HIS HOOF.

39:20.650 --> 39:26.610
[TINNY] CAN I SEE THAT KNIFE
FOR A SECOND?

39:26.650 --> 39:31.490
[ST. JULES] CAN I HELP YOU?
[TINNY] NO, I'M GOOD ACTUALLY.

39:31.530 --> 39:33.490
[ST. JULES] WHO ARE YOU?
[TINNY] ME?

39:33.530 --> 39:35.580

39:44.710 --> 39:46.340

40:03.900 --> 40:04.690
OKAY STAY WITH ME.

40:04.730 --> 40:06.730
CALL AN AMBULANCE.

40:07.820 --> 40:10.820
&lt;♪♪&gt;

40:11.950 --> 40:15.160
[JAKE] HEY THERE!
HOW YOU FEELING DOUG?

40:15.200 --> 40:17.910
[DOUG] DOWN A FINGER,
BUT NEVER BETTER.

40:17.950 --> 40:20.120
[WALTER] THE DOCTOR SAYS YOU'LL
BE OUT IN A COUPLE DAYS ANYWAY.

40:20.160 --> 40:22.790
[MARY] OH NO, HE'LL
BE OUT OF HERE TONIGHT.

40:22.830 --> 40:25.420
WE STILL HAVE A BOOKING AT THE
ALL INCLUSIVE IN ORLANDO,

40:25.460 --> 40:27.630
AND THEY CHARGE YOU AN ARM
AND A LEG IF YOU TRY TO CANCEL.

40:27.670 --> 40:28.670
[DOUG] CAN'T MISS
THE HONEYMOON.

40:28.710 --> 40:30.630
[JAKE] NO, I SUPPOSE YOU CAN'T.

40:30.670 --> 40:33.640
LISTEN I GOT JUST
ONE QUESTION FOR YOU.

40:33.680 --> 40:37.560
WHY DID YOU KIDNAP YOUR
FATHER'S HORSE?

40:37.600 --> 40:41.350
[DOUG] TO PAY FOR THE WEDDING.

40:41.390 --> 40:42.600
[MARY] OH BABE.

40:42.650 --> 40:45.520
[DES] YOU LOST YOUR RING
FINGER, TO PAY FOR THE WEDDING.

40:45.560 --> 40:48.570
TOTAL GIFT OF THE MAGI.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.530
[WALTER] OKAY, AND UH...

40:58.740 --> 41:01.120

41:02.540 --> 41:03.670
[WALTER] THANKS.

41:03.710 --> 41:04.670
PSYCH!

41:11.550 --> 41:14.550
&lt;♪♪&gt;

41:24.100 --> 41:25.650
[CHRISTIAN] HERE YOU GO BUTTONS.

41:25.690 --> 41:28.690
[JAKE] ENOUGH WITH
THE "BUTTONS" CRAP, ALRIGHT?

41:32.950 --> 41:35.320
WHAT IS THIS?
[CHRISTIAN] YOU HAPPY NOW?

41:35.360 --> 41:36.740
[JAKE] LOOK, I DON'T WANT IT.

41:36.780 --> 41:37.700
ALRIGHT? JUST FORGET IT.

41:37.740 --> 41:39.580
IT'S PROBABLY GOING
TO BOUNCE ANYWAYS.

41:39.620 --> 41:41.620
[CHRISTIAN] YOU CAN BUY YOURSELF
TO SOME NEW SOCKS AND UNDERWEAR.

41:41.660 --> 41:43.710
YOU DESERVE IT.

41:43.750 --> 41:45.620
[JAKE] SURE YOU DON'T NEED IT
FOR YOUR NEXT ROUND OF REHAB?

41:45.670 --> 41:48.500
[CHRISTIAN] I'VE BEEN CLEAN
FOR 4 WEEKS NOW.

41:48.540 --> 41:49.670
[JAKE] RIGHT.

41:49.710 --> 41:50.500
[CHRISTIAN] YOU DON'T
BELIEVE ME DO YOU?

41:50.550 --> 41:52.510
[JAKE] NO. BUT I AM FULLY
SUPPORTIVE OF YOU.

41:52.550 --> 41:54.010
[CHRISTIAN] YOU CALLING
ME A LIAR?

41:54.050 --> 41:56.840
[JAKE] YES I AM. BUT AGAIN,
I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF YOU.

41:56.890 --> 41:59.430
NIKKI TOLD ME ABOUT THE
PRESCRIPTION PAD, CHRISTIAN.

41:59.470 --> 42:02.930
[CHRISTIAN] &lt;LAUGHS&gt;
IS THAT WHAT SHE'S TELLING YOU?

42:02.980 --> 42:04.270
SHE IS NUTS, YOU KNOW THAT.

42:04.310 --> 42:05.810
SHE TRIED TO WRITE ME A
PRESCRIPTION FOR "PERCOCET".

42:05.850 --> 42:08.310
I TOLD HER, THAT I DON'T NEED
THAT ANYMORE.

42:08.360 --> 42:09.900
[JAKE] YOU DON'T NEED TO
LIE, OKAY?

42:09.940 --> 42:12.320
SO JUST KNOCK IT OFF
WITH YOUR CRAP.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.650
[CHRISTIAN] AFTER THE
FAVOUR I DID YOU?

42:14.700 --> 42:15.740
[JAKE] WHAT'S THAT NOW?

42:15.780 --> 42:17.200
[CHRISTIAN] YOUR LITTLE HOT COP
FRIEND, LESLIE.

42:17.240 --> 42:19.240
I BACKED OFF THAT.

42:22.950 --> 42:24.250
[JAKE] EXCUSE ME?

42:24.290 --> 42:25.750
[CHRISTIAN] YEAH,
I HAD A CHANCE TO GO THERE BUT

42:25.790 --> 42:27.790
I FOUND OUT ABOUT YOUR "THING"
AND I DECIDED TO LET IT SLIDE.

42:27.830 --> 42:31.300
I SAID, "LET BUTTONS HAVE A FAIR
CRACK AT IT AT LEAST".

42:31.340 --> 42:32.760
HE NEEDS IT MORE THAN I DO.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.510
[JAKE] JUST CALL ME "BUTTONS"
ONE MORE TIME. I DARE YA.

42:34.550 --> 42:35.510
