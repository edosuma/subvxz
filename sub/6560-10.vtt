Ha, ha. Except that.

Eric, come back.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.574
The mantis is up there.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.537
There's no sign of Eric.

15:53.703 --> 15:57.040
Look on the bright side, there's no sign
of the mantis either, huh?

Did you hear that, Daphne? | said--

16:01.253 --> 16:03.463
-Daphne?
-The mantis got Daphne.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.841
-We've got to find her.
-Hold on, Velma.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.968
This place is a maze of corridors.

16:08.176 --> 16:11.012
We need Professor Greer's help.

16:11.596 --> 16:13.723
Professor Greer, wake up.

16:13.890 --> 16:17.644
Yeah, wake up, wake up.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.397
What? What's going on?

Hey, guys, over here.

16:25.861 --> 16:28.488
There's something moving around
in the garden.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.991
FRED: Let's check it out.
It could be the mantis.

16:32.784 --> 16:36.788
I'll be with you as soon as | change.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.879
FRED: Okay, get ready to grab him.
On three.

16:44.045 --> 16:45.797
One, two--

16:45.964 --> 16:48.341
-Two and a quarter.
-Two and a half.

VELMA:
Over here, guys.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.483
It's Dickerman, the real estate man.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.404
Why don't you kids
mind your own business.

17:09.613 --> 17:13.742
If somebody's trying to scare
the professor away, that is our business.

And why aren't you afraid
of the creature, Mr. Dickerman?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.582
Hey, he got away.

17:20.749 --> 17:23.960
No, he didn't, Velma.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.630
Close in, Scoob.

18:12.592 --> 18:16.888
That mantis brought me out here
to the caretaker's cabin and left me.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.895
So you're still here, are you?

18:24.104 --> 18:29.526
Well, I'm telling you for the last time,
get out and take the professor with you.

to notice that, Velma.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.671
FRED: Velma's right, we've got
some more investigating to do.

18:55.218 --> 18:57.887
Look at the footprints
we've tracked across the floor.

It's a good thing my mother
isn't here to see this.

Run, everybody.

Come on, Velma,

-Run.
-Wait a minute.

This is all starting to make sense now.

The only thing
that makes sense to me is running.

The mantis.

At least the professor's safe.

outside the window.

Just a cardboard cutout on a pulley,
Shaggy, and the sounds were on tape.

-That part was simple. Oil.

when he took over Vulture's Garden.
