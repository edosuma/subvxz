<font color="#808080">ARTIE:</font> <i>Okay, welcome back.</i>

00:44.911 --> 00:47.345
<i>This is Artie Decker,
De Voice of the Fresno Grizzlies...</i>

00:47.547 --> 00:49.310
<i>and we've got a good one, my friends.</i>

00:49.716 --> 00:52.685
<i>Top of the ninth here at Chukchansi
Park, and a beautiful night.</i>

00:52.786 --> 00:55.152
<i>We can actually feel
that fall is finally on its way.</i>

00:55.355 --> 00:59.189
It's a rather crisp 107 degrees, but dry.

00:59.392 --> 01:02.657
We've got 15,000 sweaty and bloated
people all pumped up on Churros...

01:02.862 --> 01:04.955
rooting on our Fresno Grizzlies.

01:05.165 --> 01:08.464
And Brad, this is why I love
announcing Minor League Baseball...

01:08.668 --> 01:10.898
because I get to say names
like "River Cats..."

01:11.104 --> 01:12.833
or the "Rancho Cucamonga Quakes."

01:13.039 --> 01:14.939
I don't have to ever say boring names

01:15.041 --> 01:17.134
like "Tigers," or "Red Sox," or "Cubs."

01:17.710 --> 01:19.234
Okay, we got a little break in the action...

01:19.446 --> 01:21.414
as they're having
a little meeting on the mound.

01:21.614 --> 01:23.639
Artie, do you know what time it is?

01:23.850 --> 01:28.685
I sure do, Brad.
It's time for Artie's Kiss Cam!

01:28.888 --> 01:30.287
<font color="#D900D9">(PLAYING TUNE)</font>

01:30.390 --> 01:32.620
Thank you, Gwen.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.259
Let's see what kind of young lovers

01:34.360 --> 01:35.725
we got at the ballpark tonight.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.226
All right, there's a kiss.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.910
Well, you know one thing when you see

01:38.998 --> 01:40.898
a kiss like that, they're married.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.001
Wait, wait, we've got a proposal.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.831
"Will you marry me, Clara? Love, Nate."

01:46.039 --> 01:49.497
There's our young Romeo now.
And whoa! He has scored!

01:49.709 --> 01:51.990
Brad, that is what
you young people would call a "hottie."

01:52.545 --> 01:55.013
He's got Britney Spears
and he's about to give her the ring...

01:55.215 --> 01:57.012
and he goes the other way!

01:57.217 --> 01:59.310
I can't believe what I am seeing...

01:59.519 --> 02:02.977
and I'm sure she's
got a great "personality," but, oh my.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.984
I thought Jerry Garcia was dead.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.523
What's he doing
in the stands marrying him?

02:07.727 --> 02:11.458
Here at Chukchansi Park,
love is blind, and apparently so is Nate.

02:11.664 --> 02:13.757
All right, let's get back to the action

02:13.933 --> 02:16.060
as the meeting breaks up on the mound.

02:16.269 --> 02:18.829
Here's the situation.
First and third, two outs.

02:19.339 --> 02:20.738
<i>And here's the pitch.</i>

02:20.940 --> 02:22.669
<i>Swing and a miss. Diaz fires down to third.</i>

02:22.876 --> 02:23.672
<i>They've picked him off third!</i>

02:23.877 --> 02:26.141
- You're out!
<i>- Ballgame over!</i>

02:26.346 --> 02:28.371
I'll tell you, Myers is getting an earful...

02:28.581 --> 02:31.641
and as my mom used to say,
"There's no cure for dumb."

02:32.352 --> 02:34.183
Gwen! We won.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.355
And that closes out
the last game of the season.

02:36.556 --> 02:38.990
The Grizzlies take
the Sacramento River Cats...

02:39.192 --> 02:40.591
by a score of three to one.

02:40.793 --> 02:43.193
We'll be right back with a happy recap.

02:43.730 --> 02:46.358
That is a bad way to end a game.

02:46.566 --> 02:49.194
Artie. Mr. Decker.

02:49.969 --> 02:54.838
I want to say thank you
for what has been an awesome semester.

02:55.041 --> 02:59.341
I mean, you taught me a lot,
and... I got you this.

02:59.546 --> 03:00.513
What did you do, Brad?

03:00.713 --> 03:03.079
It's got all the famous calls
you told me about.

03:03.283 --> 03:05.877
Harwell, "Red" Barber, Scully, Russ Hodges.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.246
You know, that's really great,
Brad. Thank you so much.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.021
Well, as the great Yogi Berra once said,

03:11.191 --> 03:12.590
"It ain't over till it's over."

03:12.792 --> 03:14.919
Well, this Fresno Grizzlies season is over.

03:15.128 --> 03:18.120
I'm Artie Decker,
De Voice of the Fresno Grizzlies.

03:18.331 --> 03:21.459
So, on behalf of Brad Zolick
and the late Gwen Foster on the organ...

03:21.668 --> 03:25.604
good night everybody,
thanks for listening and lights out, Alice.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.730
I love this job.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.038
I'm fired?

03:32.245 --> 03:34.907
I'm sorry, Artie. I'm changing everything.

03:35.114 --> 03:37.947
New logos, new uniforms, new music.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.911
All the deadwood is floating to the sawmill.

03:39.953 --> 03:40.885
I'm deadwood?

03:40.987 --> 03:43.387
You're old school.
You reminisce and you tell stories.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.285
All our sponsors are for hearing aids,

03:45.458 --> 03:47.153
beds that go up and down, and scooters.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.328
Not the cool kind, the sad kind.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.069
We need someone who's wired in.

03:51.164 --> 03:51.823
To what?

03:52.031 --> 03:53.157
Facebook.

03:53.366 --> 03:54.890
- How many friends do you have?
- I don't have any friends.

03:55.101 --> 03:56.261
- Have you made any posts?
- No.

03:56.336 --> 03:57.776
- What was your last update?
- My what?

03:57.804 --> 03:59.135
- Have you poked anybody?
- I haven't poked anybody!

03:59.339 --> 04:00.601
- Has anybody poked you?
- No.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.775
The thing is Artie,
even if you were connected...

04:02.976 --> 04:04.777
I don't know that I'd want
to be poked by you.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.142
- How many apps do you have?
- I don't have any apps.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.506
- You don't have any apps?
- No.

04:07.513 --> 04:08.571
- Everyone has apps.
- I don't have an app.

04:08.781 --> 04:09.907
- Do you play Angry Birds?
- Angry Birds?

04:10.016 --> 04:10.983
Who's your favorite Angry Bird?

04:11.084 --> 04:12.073
I don't have a favorite Angry Bird!

04:12.185 --> 04:13.152
Everyone has a favorite Angry Bird.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.653
I don't have a favorite Angry Bird!

04:14.654 --> 04:15.746
Hashtag.

04:15.955 --> 04:17.475
When was the last time you hashtagged?

04:17.523 --> 04:19.252
Are you out of your mind?
What the heck are you talking about?

04:19.459 --> 04:20.426
We need announcers that tweet.

04:20.627 --> 04:22.428
I'll tweet.
I'll make whatever noise you want.

04:22.495 --> 04:25.658

It could give us more "us" time.

You mean me wearing a captain's

05:54.554 --> 05:56.146
You don't want to retire? Fine.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.348
You were offered a job
teaching broadcasting at Fresno State.

05:59.559 --> 06:00.821
You could teach young people.

Yeah, the Giants.
I've been chasing this job for 35 years.

You give up your dream, you give up.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.335

06:19.545 --> 06:22.343

of the way that we parent?

You said yes.

Artie, we practically
never see our grandchildren.

We've never seen their new house.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.657
They've never been to Fresno.

I don't think they like me.

Honey, they don't see you enough.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.406
They have to know you better
before they don't like you.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.853
No, but it's a real thing, Di.
And it all comes from Alice.

12:36.055 --> 12:37.579
Like the last time,
the little one left the house...

12:37.790 --> 12:39.070
wearing flippers and a bathrobe.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.526
So I made a little joke.
I said, "This one, any hope for normal?"

12:42.728 --> 12:44.992
And I got this withering gaze.

I'm not going.

These are my parents.
They're going to watch the kids this week.

19:29.201 --> 19:30.759
Welcome to Healthy Tiger.

19:30.969 --> 19:33.062
All healthy Pan Asian food.

19:33.272 --> 19:33.966
What's that?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.403
No MSG, no gluten, no sodium.

19:36.608 --> 19:38.769
Just healthy food.

19:40.612 --> 19:41.977
I'm drooling already.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.172
Pan Asian, just like me!

My mother's Japanese,
my father's Chinese...

19:45.884 --> 19:48.352

Okay.

19:58.297 --> 19:59.662
We seem to have an empty chair.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.105
No, no, that chair is for Carl.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.930
- Who's Carl?
- Barker's friend.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.466
How nice. When's he coming?

20:04.670 --> 20:05.967
He's already here.

20:06.171 --> 20:08.264
Hi, Carl. You look great.

20:08.473 --> 20:10.031
Did you get a haircut?

20:11.510 --> 20:12.477
Tell him.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.176
Carl is Barker's imaginary friend.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.678
He's a kangaroo.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.057

20:34.800 --> 20:36.631
He's in a real
"testing the boundaries" phase.

20:36.835 --> 20:39.702
Plus, he's also a little constipated.

20:40.339 --> 20:41.619
Now, you're talking my language.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.505
I have some stuff that will blow his mind.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.229
They used it to blast out the Chunnel.

20:45.344 --> 20:46.834
Thank you, Lord Arthur.

20:47.045 --> 20:49.172
Now, do you have any
special instructions for us?

what they like to eat.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.143
Yes, Mom, great. Thank you.

20:53.352 --> 20:55.616
First of all, they don't eat any sugar.

20:55.821 --> 20:56.879
No Carvel?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.647
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

20:58.857 --> 21:01.121
We have tried to introduce
just a little bit of sugar...

21:01.326 --> 21:05.160
and it was like going off the rails
of the crazy train.

21:05.364 --> 21:06.695
Oh, my gosh!

21:06.898 --> 21:08.778
And there's another subject
I'd like to discuss.

21:08.867 --> 21:09.891
Sure, anything.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.000
Your language.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.537
He won't curse. I'll break his freaking arm.

21:14.039 --> 21:15.973
That's great, but that's not what I meant.

21:16.174 --> 21:18.404
You see, there's a way
that we talk to our kids.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.578
For instance, where you would say "No"...

21:20.779 --> 21:23.145
we would say,
"Consider the consequences."

21:23.348 --> 21:24.906
Or where you would say, "Don't"...

21:25.117 --> 21:27.244
we would say, "Maybe you should try this."

21:27.786 --> 21:29.515
Or where you would say...

21:29.721 --> 21:31.746
"Quit your whining,
you're giving me a headache"...

21:31.957 --> 21:34.323
we would say, "Use your words."

21:34.526 --> 21:35.959
You see, that way, the child feels

21:36.128 --> 21:37.595
that he has value, he has worth.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.423
He is heard.

21:40.232 --> 21:41.199
It's a way.

21:43.268 --> 21:44.064
Let's order.

21:45.137 --> 21:45.933
Great.

21:47.906 --> 21:49.533
That's very good, but if you stay

21:49.708 --> 21:51.335
inside the lines, it looks better.

21:51.543 --> 21:53.204
Here, look at mine, see?

21:53.412 --> 21:55.380
Dad, we don't really worry about lines.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.044
Honey, draw whatever
your imagination tells you.

21:58.250 --> 22:01.549
But what's the point
of having lines if you're just going to...?

22:01.753 --> 22:02.720
Artie.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.357

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:44.103
What you did back there
was pretty dangerous.

01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:45.109
Do you know that?

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:46.838
Carl told me to do it.

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:51.118
I don't think Carl is being
a very good friend to you.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.811
For a kangaroo,
he's something of a thrill-seeker.

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:57.515
And I think it's time
that you start telling Carl what to do.

01:04:58.027 --> 01:04:59.153
One other thing.

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:01.486
I was supposed to...

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:05.634
watch after you today,
and I didn't do a good job.

01:05:06.936 --> 01:05:08.028
I'm sorry.

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:12.038
So, Farty would appreciate it...

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:14.072
if when we get home...

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:17.705
you don't tell
anyone what happened. Okay?

01:05:18.514 --> 01:05:19.981
Twenty bucks.

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:22.080
Deal.

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:24.247
Let's go home. Come on.

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:31.354
Carl, come on.

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:35.690
- How could you?
- What?

01:05:35.898 --> 01:05:36.865
You think I don't know?

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:38.260
I want my 20 bucks back.

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:39.661
He's just a little boy!

01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:40.836
He's fine.

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:43.005
Fine? Take a look at him.

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:45.002
Not him. Turner.

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:46.288
What are you talking about?

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:50.209
I'm talking about Turner
and that brilliant advice you gave him.

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:54.640
<font color="#808080">ARTIE:</font> Hey.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.588
I have to ask, did you hit him back?

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.690
- No.
- Why not?

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:04.689
B-Because I hit him f-first.

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:06.156
Oh. Then he...

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:09.024
He started screaming
and s-someone helped him fight me.

01:06:09.231 --> 01:06:10.911
Two against one? How big was this other...

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.692
It was his little sister.

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:13.891
She did this.

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:16.394
Turner, this is all my fault.

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:19.564
When I said stand
up for yourself, I didn't mean hitting.

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:21.105
All right, listen.

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:25.035
Oh, boy. The older I get,
the lower the floor gets.

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:29.073
Turner, can I share something with you?

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:31.685
Just between me and you.
No one else knows this.

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:33.377
This is just two guys talking.

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:37.184
When I was your age,
I was very shy because I was short.

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:38.860
I didn't talk to anybody.

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:40.460
And my self-esteem...

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:44.929
You know, the way
I feel about myself, was really bad.

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:46.396
Do you ever feel that way?

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:49.961
Yeah? Well, you know what? You shouldn't.

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:51.730
Because you're a great kid.

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:54.975
All right, I want to play you something.

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:57.441
Hey, house, I want to play something.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:06:59.311
Okay.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:02.710
Oh. Okay.

01:07:03.953 --> 01:07:05.818
Now, the first time I heard this...

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:09.150
I knew right away that I had found my voice.

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:12.293
I knew that I had to become
a baseball announcer.

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:13.416
And once I knew that...

01:07:13.496 --> 01:07:15.856
it didn't matter what anybody
else thought or said about me.

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:18.160
Sh-sh-shot heard round the w-world?

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:20.665
Right. The shot heard round the world.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:21.870
Let me tell you about it.

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:27.632
It's 1951. Long time ago.

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:30.141
Two teams: Brooklyn Dodgers,
New York Giants.

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:31.813
And they hated each other.

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:34.312
L-Like Luke S-Skywalker and D-Darth Vader.

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:35.484
Worse.

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:38.585
Well, the baseball season ends
and they're tied.

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.346
Now, this one game would decide...

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:42.046
who would go to the World Series

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:43.625
against the great New York Yankees.

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:45.691
Biggest game in the history of New York.

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:48.089
Bottom of the ninth inning, two outs,

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:49.789
the Giants are losing 4 to 2...

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:52.559
and a batter
named Bobby Thomson comes up to bat.

and throw it away on a whim.

01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:09.422
I hate you and I wish
anyone else was my mother!

01:20:11.001 --> 01:20:12.935

01:20:14.705 --> 01:20:16.745
I couldn't have
gotten through the week without you.

01:20:23.113 --> 01:20:24.714
I say we head for the airport right now.

01:20:24.882 --> 01:20:27.476
Don't even take our clothes,
we just skedaddle.

01:20:31.355 --> 01:20:34.347
I followed you for 35 years, Artie.

01:20:37.328 --> 01:20:41.697
Wherever you needed to be,
that's where I was.

01:20:42.566 --> 01:20:44.591
No complaints.

01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:48.634
Well, some.

01:20:51.008 --> 01:20:52.839
But this week...

01:20:53.978 --> 01:20:57.141
This week was supposed to be about
us and our grandchildren.

01:20:58.182 --> 01:21:00.116
Not you.

01:21:01.819 --> 01:21:03.343
Not you.

01:21:06.957 --> 01:21:10.154
Did you have to go to that audition?

01:21:11.929 --> 01:21:14.659
It's not one of my better moments.

01:21:18.102 --> 01:21:20.593
For one wonderful hour...

01:21:22.039 --> 01:21:26.840
we weren't the "other" grandparents.

01:21:40.257 --> 01:21:44.091

horrible to let her go to that party.

Well, I was thinking about that.

01:21:56.307 --> 01:22:00.539
You know, they didn't kill
Carl, only Barker could do that.

01:22:02.012 --> 01:22:06.745
And it somehow took us
not being here for him to do it.

01:22:08.352 --> 01:22:10.582
So, what's your point?

01:22:11.822 --> 01:22:14.120
Maybe we coddle him too much.

01:22:15.092 --> 01:22:17.788
Maybe he needed a little tough love...

01:22:17.995 --> 01:22:20.054
to let go of his imaginary friend.

01:22:20.264 --> 01:22:24.894
But, Phil, that would make my father right.

01:22:25.369 --> 01:22:27.929

What were you even doing there?

01:23:18.022 --> 01:23:20.718
I was on an audition.

01:23:21.592 --> 01:23:23.583
Because the Grizzlies fired me.

01:23:24.795 --> 01:23:26.319
What?

01:23:27.798 --> 01:23:28.992
Why didn't you tell us?

01:23:29.199 --> 01:23:30.325
Because it's humiliating.

01:23:30.534 --> 01:23:32.024
Why would they do that?

01:23:32.236 --> 01:23:34.067
You're so good at that job.

01:23:34.938 --> 01:23:35.905
Maybe not good enough.

01:23:38.475 --> 01:23:39.840
Alice...

01:23:40.811 --> 01:23:41.971
your mom was really hoping...

01:23:41.979 --> 01:23:45.380
that this trip would help bring
her closer to her grandchildren.

01:23:46.216 --> 01:23:47.911
And she and Harper have developed

01:23:48.018 --> 01:23:51.010
a relationship that's kind of great...

01:23:51.288 --> 01:23:55.247
and I don't want
to see that end just because I screwed up.

01:24:00.297 --> 01:24:01.821
- What about you?
- Hmm?

01:24:02.266 --> 01:24:04.564
Don't you want a relationship
with your grandchildren?

01:24:04.768 --> 01:24:06.463
Of course I do.

01:24:06.670 --> 01:24:08.069
I mean...

01:24:08.272 --> 01:24:12.140
like an hour
before you came home, it was really good.

01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:15.203
It's just that sometimes...

01:24:17.181 --> 01:24:18.876

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:38.625
How old were you when Harper was born?

01:24:38.869 --> 01:24:40.131
- Twenty-six.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:24:40.337 --> 01:24:41.658
Did you know what you were doing?

01:24:41.972 --> 01:24:42.961
No.

01:24:43.941 --> 01:24:46.842
I was 23 when you came along.

01:24:47.044 --> 01:24:50.673
And I was terrified, because you didn't
come with any instructions.

01:24:50.881 --> 01:24:52.678
And I thought I was doing okay.

01:24:52.883 --> 01:24:57.183
Because unlike my father,
I wasn't constantly telling you...

01:24:57.387 --> 01:25:00.356
what an annoying little waste
of time you were...

01:25:00.557 --> 01:25:02.616
and believe me, I'm cleaning that up.

01:25:02.826 --> 01:25:05.624
And I thought that we were
actually having fun.

01:25:05.829 --> 01:25:09.287
Me and the weather girl...

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:13.095
and the cutest little girl you ever saw,
traveling around the country.

01:25:13.303 --> 01:25:16.170
But then years go by,
and your daughter goes off to college...

01:25:16.373 --> 01:25:20.002
and she doesn't come home
for Thanksgiving or Christmas.

01:25:21.078 --> 01:25:22.602
Or summers.

01:25:22.813 --> 01:25:24.144
Or ever.

01:25:24.848 --> 01:25:28.113
And you get these clues, this inkling...

01:25:28.318 --> 01:25:31.412
that perhaps all those years
she wasn't having such a good time...

01:25:31.622 --> 01:25:36.650
and that maybe she thought
you didn't do such a good job.

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:39.727
And that really hurts. Doesn't it?

01:25:42.399 --> 01:25:44.060
Yes.

01:25:44.434 --> 01:25:47.892
So, little girl,
I have to give you three put-ups.

01:25:49.273 --> 01:25:50.240
- No, Dad.
- Please.

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:51.338
