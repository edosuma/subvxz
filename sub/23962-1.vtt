01:22.375 --> 01:23.893
Next frame.

01:29.084 --> 01:30.625
Next.

01:37.042 --> 01:38.751
Zoom in, please.

01:41.793 --> 01:43.501
- Dori.
- Yes?

01:44.543 --> 01:46.626
We seem to have a
widening of the aorta.

01:47.294 --> 01:49.169
I think you're right.

01:49.586 --> 01:51.711
Shall we go for open surgery?

01:51.919 --> 01:54.502
No, I'll dilate the
coronary artery.

01:54.669 --> 01:56.502
Bring the wire.

01:56.836 --> 01:58.353
You're taking that risk?

01:58.377 --> 01:59.812
<i>3.5 catheter.</i>

01:59.836 --> 02:01.627
Finnur.

02:02.170 --> 02:06.479
- I'm not sure about this.
- Don't worry, it's under control.

02:06.503 --> 02:10.586
- 10 or 12 balloons?
- Uh, 12.

02:20.171 --> 02:22.480
Give me a hand
with the gray one.

02:22.504 --> 02:25.337
Easy does it.

02:27.088 --> 02:28.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

02:30.671 --> 02:31.731
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:31.755 --> 02:34.589
Stay calm.

02:41.298 --> 02:44.357
Be sure to treat him nicely.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.881
He was Dad's favorite.

02:47.631 --> 02:49.840
Wary as ever, are you?

02:51.089 --> 02:53.673
That's my boy.

04:00.845 --> 04:02.094
Are you all right?

04:02.845 --> 04:04.678
I've never felt at ease here.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.970
Let's hurry up then.

04:07.179 --> 04:10.179
We have to get things
ready for the funeral.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.346
- Thanks for helping me.
- Hmm.

04:18.762 --> 04:20.156
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi.

04:20.180 --> 04:24.263
You said it was only a 10-minute drive,
but I still got lost on the way.

04:29.013 --> 04:31.948
So, this was your
father's place.

04:31.972 --> 04:35.573
He was tough, the old man,
living here by himself.

04:35.597 --> 04:37.489
He had the horses.

04:37.513 --> 04:41.139
He was better with
horses than people.

04:42.014 --> 04:43.431
What will you do with the house?

04:47.848 --> 04:51.598
Get rid of it. As
soon as possible.

04:59.015 --> 05:01.867
Sorry we're late, Gulli.
We got held up.

05:01.891 --> 05:05.682
That's all right.
All in good time.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.409
Your father was one of a kind.

05:13.433 --> 05:15.975
The old bastard.

05:18.350 --> 05:21.225
- I'll see if I can get it going.
- Good.

05:23.476 --> 05:27.243
We'll keep it off
the books, right?

05:27.267 --> 05:30.035
Sure. No problem.

05:30.059 --> 05:32.143
Thanks, Gulli.

06:12.020 --> 06:15.812
Sorry I'm late. I overslept.

06:21.271 --> 06:24.581
As a father has compassion
on his children,

06:24.605 --> 06:27.063
so the Lord has
compassion on us,

06:27.188 --> 06:29.498
for He knows how we are formed.

06:29.522 --> 06:32.147
He remembers that we are dust.

06:33.939 --> 06:36.499
We are gathered here today
to pay our last tributes

06:36.523 --> 06:38.749
to Kjartan Finnsson,

06:38.773 --> 06:41.564
a member of Parliament,
an entrepreneur,

06:41.689 --> 06:44.356
the devoted and dearly beloved
father and grandfather.

06:45.190 --> 06:48.856
A good man, who now
has passed away.

06:51.689 --> 06:53.249
I overslept, that's all.

06:53.273 --> 06:54.833
- At 3:00 in the afternoon?
- Yes.

06:54.857 --> 06:57.583
Anna, it's your
grandfather's funeral.

06:57.607 --> 07:01.149
Lay off me! Give me a break.

07:03.024 --> 07:04.083
What's wrong?

07:04.107 --> 07:07.751
Óttar is picking me up. I don't
need this bullshit right now.

07:07.775 --> 07:10.083
- Aren't you coming to the wake?
- No!

07:10.107 --> 07:14.858
- Look at me, I'm a mess!
- Anna...

07:20.275 --> 07:23.692
- How did it go?
- Let's just go.

08:02.611 --> 08:05.671
<i>Hi, it's Anna. At a party...
Leave a message.</i>

08:08.529 --> 08:09.695
Did you break your record?

08:10.112 --> 08:11.113
No.

08:13.654 --> 08:15.654
23 minutes.

08:18.862 --> 08:24.048
I was just wondering... You
said you'd pay Anna's rent

08:24.072 --> 08:27.696
while she was still in school.
But now she's dropped out.

08:28.530 --> 08:30.280
Maybe she'll move back home.

08:30.696 --> 08:32.780
She would never do that.

08:34.863 --> 08:36.322
Why don't you talk to her?

08:37.864 --> 08:40.030
She needs to take
some responsibility.

09:00.032 --> 09:01.157
Hi.

09:01.698 --> 09:03.717
Hello.

09:03.741 --> 09:06.050
- Is Anna in?
- You're her dad, right?

09:06.074 --> 09:07.074
Yes.

09:07.199 --> 09:10.200
- She's in her room.
- Thanks.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.033
- Hi, Anna.
- Hi.

09:17.367 --> 09:18.534
Who's that girl?

09:19.242 --> 09:22.259
It's Lóa. She's crashing
here for a while.

09:22.283 --> 09:26.052
I'm not here that much,
and I needed the money.

09:26.076 --> 09:28.386
Where are you when
you're not here?

09:28.410 --> 09:29.576
With Óttar.

09:32.284 --> 09:34.552
Are you serious?

09:34.576 --> 09:35.719
About what?

09:35.743 --> 09:36.993
You and Óttar.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.868
- Dad...
- What?

09:41.035 --> 09:43.785
Yeah... Yes.

09:44.868 --> 09:46.160
He's all right.

09:47.910 --> 09:49.971
Have you heard from your mum?

09:49.995 --> 09:51.178
What about?

09:51.202 --> 09:52.971
You know... Are you in touch?

09:52.995 --> 09:54.845
You know, "How are you?"

09:54.869 --> 09:55.887
"Fine."

09:55.911 --> 09:57.054
"How's the weather?"

09:57.078 --> 10:00.286
"It's crap. How's the weather
in LA?" "Fantastic!"

10:02.537 --> 10:04.495
Just a load of crap.

10:09.246 --> 10:10.413
Anna.

10:10.996 --> 10:11.996
Hmm?

10:12.620 --> 10:14.079
You know I love you.

10:15.371 --> 10:17.830
Yeah, I know.

10:18.871 --> 10:21.204
All right then, sweetie.

10:27.913 --> 10:28.997
Dad...

10:29.871 --> 10:31.038
What?

10:35.205 --> 10:37.039
Oh, sweetie.

10:40.539 --> 10:42.415
Oh... Oh...

10:51.748 --> 10:53.707
They're here.

10:55.207 --> 10:57.708
- Anna.
- Hey, muffin!

11:00.999 --> 11:03.041
So good to see you. How are you?

11:03.624 --> 11:05.041
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:07.791 --> 11:08.850
Is that your dog?

11:08.874 --> 11:12.518
- Yeah.
- Isn't he cute? His name is Bull.

11:12.542 --> 11:14.184
He's just a puppy.

11:14.208 --> 11:15.726
Dad, meet Óttar.

11:15.750 --> 11:17.042
- Hi.
- Hello.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.875
- Ta-da!
- Wow!

11:26.459 --> 11:28.686
You've been practicing!

11:28.710 --> 11:32.376
- I played that at the school concert.
- Wow.

11:32.876 --> 11:34.978
You have to let us
know next time.

11:35.002 --> 11:36.602
All right.

11:36.626 --> 11:39.043
Here's some salad.

11:44.460 --> 11:47.104
What was it your
grandfather used to say

11:47.128 --> 11:49.937
when he was served salad?

11:49.961 --> 11:52.544
Yeah. I don't eat grass.

11:53.295 --> 11:54.728
Good one.

11:54.752 --> 11:56.729
She told me he was in
Parliament or something.

11:56.753 --> 11:59.396
- He was.
- So he was the man.

11:59.420 --> 12:01.628
Yeah.

12:03.129 --> 12:06.254
So, what do you do for a living?

12:07.212 --> 12:09.462
- Sólveig.
- Just asking.

12:09.795 --> 12:14.045
I'm into... all sorts of things.

12:14.754 --> 12:15.856
Like what?

12:15.880 --> 12:18.713
Selling cars and stuff.

12:23.796 --> 12:25.838
What about you, Sólveig?
What do you do?

12:27.255 --> 12:30.023
I used to be a dancer,
but I had some injuries,

12:30.047 --> 12:32.314
so now I teach yoga.

12:32.338 --> 12:33.964
Sexy.

12:38.797 --> 12:41.882
Bull! What the fuck
are you doing?

12:42.214 --> 12:43.715
Get over here!

12:44.131 --> 12:46.215
God damn it.

12:47.715 --> 12:50.007
I'll get some tissues.

13:11.842 --> 13:15.568
- Hello.
<i>- Daddy, I need your help.</i>

13:15.592 --> 13:19.193
<i>Someone's here, there's blood all over.
You have to come.</i>

13:19.217 --> 13:20.384
Anna...

13:32.885 --> 13:34.194
<i>Hi, it's Anna. At a party...</i>

13:34.218 --> 13:38.218
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, but it's Anna.

13:39.427 --> 13:44.570
<i>- 999, how may I help?
</i>- -My daughter just called.

13:44.594 --> 13:46.886
Something's happened to her.
It's an emergency.

13:53.303 --> 13:55.219
What's going on?

14:01.928 --> 14:03.863
Are you all right, sweetie?

14:03.887 --> 14:05.887
Daddy...

14:06.220 --> 14:07.530
Dad.

14:07.554 --> 14:10.220
- They put...
- We have to take her with us.

14:11.804 --> 14:13.238
Calm down, sweetheart.

14:13.262 --> 14:16.488
- They put something in my uterus.
- Who did?

14:16.512 --> 14:19.697
The guys... at the party...

14:19.721 --> 14:22.448
Easy now. Try to stay calm.
It'll be all right.

14:22.472 --> 14:23.889
We'll have it checked.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.889
Daddy!

14:52.307 --> 14:55.348
- Hi.
- Hi, darling.

14:56.557 --> 14:59.034
- Have you seen her yet?
- They're examining her.

14:59.058 --> 15:01.640
Hi, are you Finnur,
Anna's father?

15:01.766 --> 15:03.141
- Yes, hello.
- Hello.

15:03.308 --> 15:04.534
- Hello.
- Sólveig.

15:04.558 --> 15:07.409
Birna Valsdóttir. Detective.

15:07.433 --> 15:10.826
They call us if there's any
suspicion of sexual abuse.

15:10.850 --> 15:11.868
Oh, no.

15:11.892 --> 15:14.892
Actually, it appears that
nothing of the sort took place.

15:15.225 --> 15:16.493
Something must have happened.

15:16.517 --> 15:19.493
It's best that I let
the doctor explain.

15:19.517 --> 15:21.910
We found drugs in her apartment.

15:21.934 --> 15:26.060
She denies owning them, but
we'll need to investigate that.

15:26.268 --> 15:31.619
If there's anything you want to
discuss or tell us, get in touch.

15:31.643 --> 15:34.060
Thank you.

15:34.602 --> 15:39.703
She's of legal age, so this
is just an informal chat.

15:39.727 --> 15:41.661
You know how this goes, Finnur.

15:41.685 --> 15:43.061
Mmm.

15:43.227 --> 15:47.644
There is nothing to indicate
that she was attacked.

15:48.227 --> 15:52.728
There's a cut on her hand,
from a mirror she smashed.

15:53.186 --> 15:59.455
As you may have realized, she
shows signs of heavy drug abuse.

15:59.479 --> 16:04.246
Typical psychosis.
Hallucinations, paranoia.

16:04.270 --> 16:08.039
- Will she be staying here?
- No.

16:08.063 --> 16:12.313
Her condition isn't
critical enough.

16:12.729 --> 16:16.872
As you know, we can't hold
her against her will.

16:16.896 --> 16:19.063
Of course not.

16:24.230 --> 16:27.206
Here, take this.

16:27.230 --> 16:28.748
It'll help you sleep.

16:28.772 --> 16:30.707
- Where's Óttar?
- Relax.

16:30.731 --> 16:33.248
- I need to talk to him.
- Anna...

16:33.272 --> 16:35.648
Not in this condition.

16:37.522 --> 16:41.648
- Is Anna feeling sick?
- She's just tired.

16:41.856 --> 16:44.023
- Hi, muffin.
- Hi.

16:46.357 --> 16:48.958
- I have to go to work.
- Will you drop off Hrefna?

16:48.982 --> 16:50.273
Sure.

17:01.066 --> 17:03.066
Have a nice day, sweetie.

17:03.191 --> 17:04.858
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:05.398 --> 17:07.192
Hi, Eyja!

17:10.566 --> 17:12.400
Cross clamps.

17:35.902 --> 17:38.086
<i>She woke up. I left her
alone for a minute,</i>

17:38.110 --> 17:40.003
<i>and when I came back
out, she was gone.</i>

17:40.027 --> 17:42.378
<i>- Where did she go?
- I don't know.</i>

17:42.402 --> 17:47.028
<i>She can't have gone far. Maybe
she went to catch the bus.</i>

17:48.903 --> 17:52.903
- I don't think she has any shoes on.
- I'll go look for her.

18:22.489 --> 18:24.614
- Excuse me.
- What do you think you're doing?

18:26.572 --> 18:28.840
Where are you off to?

18:28.864 --> 18:31.632
I need to talk to Óttar, but
she wouldn't let me call him.

18:31.656 --> 18:36.715
Come on, sweetie. Of course
you can call him. Let's go.

18:36.739 --> 18:38.406
Sorry about that.

18:40.323 --> 18:43.633
- I need a refund.
- Come on, let's go. Sorry.

18:43.657 --> 18:45.883
Why don't you stay
until you recover?

18:45.907 --> 18:48.883
I've told you, I'm fine.

18:48.907 --> 18:53.550
After a night out, I couldn't sleep
because my neighbor was too loud.

18:53.574 --> 18:56.925
So now I'll go home and rest,
and Óttar will stay with me.

18:59.658 --> 19:01.616
He's here.

19:11.575 --> 19:12.885
Let's go.

19:12.909 --> 19:13.927
What's going on?

19:13.951 --> 19:16.242
Anna, put this on. It's cold.

19:16.826 --> 19:19.117
- No, I'm fine.
- You'll be cold.

19:20.201 --> 19:21.867
What's going on?

19:23.159 --> 19:26.034
- Were you there last night?
- No.

19:26.409 --> 19:27.969
She just told me.

19:27.993 --> 19:31.284
- She needs to rest, so no drugs.
- I'm not into that shit anymore.

19:32.160 --> 19:35.928
She's a good girl. Just been
partying a bit too much.

19:35.952 --> 19:38.053
I'll look after her. I promise.

19:39.702 --> 19:41.386
- What?
- Can we go?

19:41.410 --> 19:43.720
- I'm just talking to your old man.
- Come on, let's go.

19:43.744 --> 19:46.120
- Anna...
- What?

19:46.911 --> 19:50.370
- Call me so I know how you're doing.
- All right, bye.

19:50.786 --> 19:52.262
She'll call.

20:11.996 --> 20:16.722
She's not answering. I'll
see if I can find her.

20:16.746 --> 20:20.080
- Would you like me to come with you?
- No, I'll take care of it.

20:28.247 --> 20:30.539
<i>- Hello.
</i>- -Hi...

20:31.580 --> 20:34.081
It's Finnur, Anna's father.

20:47.374 --> 20:52.457
We'll finish this later. Lock
the door on your way out.

20:55.874 --> 20:57.308
Hi.

20:57.332 --> 21:00.250
- Is Anna with you?
- Wait here.

21:01.958 --> 21:04.375
Anna!

21:06.250 --> 21:08.417
- Your dad's here.
- Are you joking?

21:08.583 --> 21:10.750
Get rid of him. Now.

21:13.209 --> 21:14.893
- What?
- Hi.

21:14.917 --> 21:17.560
Weren't you going home?
You said you'd call.

21:17.584 --> 21:21.209
You told me to rest.
Does it matter where?

21:21.418 --> 21:23.686
You just got out of hospital.
What does it take...

21:23.710 --> 21:26.227
Oh, my God. You're so manic!

21:26.251 --> 21:28.602
I took something
to help me sleep.

21:28.626 --> 21:30.144
Then you come chasing after me.

21:30.168 --> 21:32.436
No wonder I'm so tense,
with you so fucking psycho!

21:32.460 --> 21:35.061
- Leave me alone.
- Will you please listen?

21:35.085 --> 21:38.836
It's too late for that now.
Just leave me alone.

21:51.420 --> 21:54.021
- Let's do this again soon.
- Yeah.

21:54.045 --> 21:55.087
It was fun.

21:56.586 --> 22:00.962
She's high. She got the
drugs from you, right?

22:02.546 --> 22:04.087
What are you talking about?

22:06.004 --> 22:10.046
She's coming home with me, or
I'll report you for possession.

22:15.630 --> 22:18.855
Do what you have to, pal.

22:18.879 --> 22:22.505
But be prepared to
take the consequences.

22:51.382 --> 22:53.483
We had a talk with
your daughter.

22:53.507 --> 22:56.341
She didn't want to come with us.

22:56.924 --> 23:00.359
If she were under 18, we could have
removed her from the premises.

23:00.383 --> 23:01.758
What about the drugs?

23:02.049 --> 23:06.216
Well, he denied having any.

23:06.758 --> 23:09.758
We can't just go in
without a search warrant.

23:09.883 --> 23:12.925
I suggest you talk to the
narcotics department.

23:13.050 --> 23:15.342
There's a hotline you
can call anonymously.

23:17.426 --> 23:20.986
<i>To search the apartment, we'd
have to get a judge's permit.</i>

23:21.010 --> 23:22.986
And we'd need
something tangible.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.069
Even if we found something,

23:25.093 --> 23:28.093
there'd be a long wait until
he'd start serving sentence.

23:28.260 --> 23:30.594
There's no instant solution.

23:30.844 --> 23:34.927
- There must be something you can do.
- We'll consider every lead.

23:35.094 --> 23:38.344
What comes out of it and
when is a different thing.

23:39.760 --> 23:42.677
What if this was your child?

23:42.886 --> 23:44.445
But she's not a child, is she?

23:44.469 --> 23:47.261
According to the
law, she's an adult.

23:49.219 --> 23:52.612
I know how you feel. I've
seen this too many times.

23:52.636 --> 23:54.737
But there's really
not much you can do.

23:54.761 --> 23:56.280
I've heard that before.

23:56.304 --> 23:57.737
She's a clever girl.

23:57.761 --> 24:03.154
These guys are exciting for a
while, but the thrill won't last.

24:03.178 --> 24:05.738
I'm sure she'll
come to her senses.

24:05.762 --> 24:08.430
What if she doesn't?

24:09.679 --> 24:14.013
If there's anything I can
do, just let me know.

24:49.765 --> 24:52.599
Hey, be careful.
You'll cut yourself.

24:56.266 --> 24:57.474
Anna...

25:02.391 --> 25:05.225
What are you doing, sweetheart?

25:07.558 --> 25:09.034
I just needed some change.

25:09.058 --> 25:12.410
I was at a party close by and
I'm taking the bus downtown.

25:12.434 --> 25:15.994
It's half past 3:00. The buses
don't run at this hour.

25:16.018 --> 25:18.559
- A taxi then.
- Let's get you cleaned up.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.268
Then I'll take you home.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.101
Turn here.

25:38.311 --> 25:39.412
Where are you going?

25:39.436 --> 25:44.269
- I'm going to see if Óttar is downtown.
- At this hour?

25:45.978 --> 25:47.270
- Anna...
- Dad!

25:47.519 --> 25:49.079
Why don't you go home
and get some rest?

25:49.103 --> 25:51.288
You're kidding, right?
Let me out.

25:51.312 --> 25:53.787
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Dad, you're not listening.

25:53.811 --> 25:56.872
Open the door. I'll walk.
Just open the door!

25:56.896 --> 25:58.913
What's wrong with you?
Just stop the car.

25:58.937 --> 26:01.395
Anna!

26:03.104 --> 26:04.812
Anna.

26:09.688 --> 26:12.146
Don't be foolish.

26:14.022 --> 26:15.730
Where are you going?

26:18.938 --> 26:20.522
Anna.

26:33.522 --> 26:36.291
Why don't we go someplace?

26:36.315 --> 26:37.416
Just you and me.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.708
- I can't.
- We'll get through this.

26:40.732 --> 26:43.416
I can't just leave.
What about Óttar?

26:43.440 --> 26:47.066
- He'll wait.
- Wait?

26:47.940 --> 26:51.083
Maybe it'll do you good
to have some time apart.

26:51.107 --> 26:54.441
To find out if you're
right for each other.

26:55.191 --> 26:57.149
Dad...

26:57.816 --> 27:00.441
I love him.

27:01.483 --> 27:04.941
I'm madly in love with him.

27:09.817 --> 27:10.984
What?

27:16.901 --> 27:19.942
You just think he's an asshole.

27:23.151 --> 27:25.711
He isn't like that.

27:25.735 --> 27:29.003
With the stuff you're using,
you're not seeing things clearly.

27:29.027 --> 27:32.902
Sober up for a start. Then maybe
you'll know for real if you love him.

27:33.235 --> 27:38.611
I'm sharing my feelings and you
just trample all over them.

27:40.028 --> 27:41.819
I'm not saying you
don't love him.

27:41.944 --> 27:44.087
No? You hate him.

27:44.111 --> 27:45.587
- I don't hate him.
- You do!

27:45.611 --> 27:48.070
I don't even know him.

28:37.949 --> 28:39.674
- Anna.
<i>- Go away.</i>

28:39.698 --> 28:43.449
- It's me.
<i>- I don't want to see you.</i>

30:10.621 --> 30:13.622
- I'm taking him for a walk.
- I'll come, too.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.789
Hurry up, it's freezing.

30:33.623 --> 30:34.766
Hey, Bull!

31:55.462 --> 31:56.688
<i>999, how may I help?</i>

31:56.712 --> 31:59.963
Can you send the police to this number?
It's an emergency.

32:00.129 --> 32:01.897
<i>- Number 26.
</i>-Apartment 702.

32:01.921 --> 32:04.171
<i>- Could I have your...</i>

32:36.965 --> 32:39.358
- Is Daddy home?
- Yes...

32:39.382 --> 32:42.674
- Can I talk to him?
- Yes.

32:43.091 --> 32:44.882
Go inside, sweetie.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.983
Mum, Óttar is here.

32:49.007 --> 32:50.526
Hello.

32:50.550 --> 32:52.966
What do you want?

32:54.508 --> 32:56.484
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:56.508 --> 32:59.008
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

33:16.467 --> 33:18.444
- What are you up to?
- What do you want?

33:18.468 --> 33:23.736
Firstly, the guy who broke in might
as well have planted the stuff.

33:23.760 --> 33:27.444
The cops didn't even press charges.
They just let me walk.

33:27.468 --> 33:31.278
Secondly, the woman
next door, she saw you.

33:31.302 --> 33:34.195
Don't worry, she won't talk.
That's been taken care of.

33:34.219 --> 33:36.945
Last, but not least, Finnur...

33:36.969 --> 33:39.112
You don't fuck with me.

33:39.136 --> 33:41.153
It's not my fault Anna
likes to powder her nose.

33:41.177 --> 33:43.237
- You need to fix this mess.
- What mess?

33:43.261 --> 33:45.862
Someone has to pay
for the stuff.

33:45.886 --> 33:49.446
Six million, if you pay up now.
We're talking wholesale price.

33:49.470 --> 33:51.780
If they come after you,
it will be a lot more.

33:51.804 --> 33:54.137
You're not getting
any money from me.

33:55.137 --> 33:56.947
Don't be stupid.

33:56.971 --> 34:01.155
You'd rather deal with me
than the guys who own it.

34:01.179 --> 34:04.596
Just pay up, or
things will get ugly.

34:04.762 --> 34:08.471
You're not getting anything
from me, so get the hell out.

34:08.929 --> 34:10.679
Fucking moron!

34:11.471 --> 34:13.489
Don't you get it? Fucking idiot!

34:14.638 --> 34:15.972
I've called the police.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.197
This is your fucking fault.

34:29.306 --> 34:30.681
Poor darling...

34:42.266 --> 34:44.449
<i>Hi, it's Anna. At a party...</i>

34:44.474 --> 34:46.181
- Am I interrupting?
- No.

34:46.308 --> 34:49.349
We have a case in the ICU.
Trauma after a brutal assault.

34:49.474 --> 34:53.308
I could use your opinion.

34:54.058 --> 34:57.409
Ruptured left eye,
brain hemorrhage,

34:57.433 --> 35:02.285
collapsed lung, and a heart
attack on top of it all.

35:02.309 --> 35:05.017
He'll need acute
coronary intervention.

35:05.142 --> 35:07.201
Do they know who did it?

35:07.225 --> 35:09.350
Some thugs showed up at
his house with a shotgun,

35:10.184 --> 35:12.726
said his son owed them money

35:13.310 --> 35:15.494
and shot him in the chest.

35:15.518 --> 35:18.703
The shells were loaded
with cut-off nails,

35:18.727 --> 35:21.411
so it must have hurt like hell.

35:21.435 --> 35:23.977
But apparently it
doesn't kill you.

35:25.518 --> 35:27.578
Did they catch them?

35:27.602 --> 35:30.727
No, and they
probably never will.

36:23.689 --> 36:25.522
Óttar!

36:28.481 --> 36:30.315
Have you got it?

36:31.064 --> 36:33.791
- Can we talk?
- All right.

36:33.815 --> 36:37.208
But did you bring the money?

36:37.232 --> 36:38.541
Nice.

36:38.565 --> 36:40.149
Come on.

36:46.399 --> 36:48.482
So, you've got the money?

36:48.774 --> 36:50.792
- Here's three million.
- Three?

36:50.816 --> 36:53.126
I'll pay now, if you
break up with Anna.

36:53.150 --> 36:54.750
This has nothing
to do with Anna.

36:54.774 --> 36:57.876
It's just your problem
if you don't like me.

36:57.900 --> 36:59.817
It's six fucking million.

37:00.358 --> 37:01.775
Just pay up.

37:04.109 --> 37:06.169
What happened to your face?

37:06.193 --> 37:09.984
- What are you talking about?
- Who did this to you?

37:11.817 --> 37:14.818
Like I said, here's
three million.

37:16.359 --> 37:18.485
You'll get the rest
when you've let her go.

37:32.903 --> 37:34.986
Hey, geezer.

37:35.153 --> 37:36.569
A word.

37:37.736 --> 37:39.403
Listen...

37:39.986 --> 37:41.795
You're so fucking stupid.

37:41.819 --> 37:44.421
You don't know what I've
been through because of you.

37:44.445 --> 37:49.296
If you call the police, you'll deal
with guys you wish you'd never met.

37:49.320 --> 37:52.130
Unless you want your girls
to end up without a father.

37:52.154 --> 37:53.653
- Is that what you want?
- Let me go.

37:53.779 --> 37:56.130
- You fucking moron!
- Let go of me!

37:56.154 --> 37:58.505
You fucking moron!

38:28.615 --> 38:30.907
HURRY HOME! THERE'S
BEEN A BREAK-IN.

38:37.282 --> 38:41.491
<i>Hi, this is Sólveig.
Please leave a message.</i>

38:53.949 --> 38:56.283
Are you all right, darling?

38:56.991 --> 38:59.200
So they left the door open?

38:59.325 --> 39:03.658
Strange that nothing seems to
be missing, just vandalized.

39:03.950 --> 39:08.135
There's no sign of forced entry.

39:08.159 --> 39:12.076
- Perhaps you left the door unlocked?
- No.

39:14.326 --> 39:16.802
They even went into
Hrefna's room.

39:16.826 --> 39:18.618
Hrefna...

39:39.328 --> 39:40.596
- Hi.
- Hello.

39:40.620 --> 39:42.429
- I'm Hrefna's dad.
- Yes, I know.

39:42.453 --> 39:44.971
I didn't see her outside. She
usually waits by the fence.

39:44.995 --> 39:48.263
She's not here. She's
probably with Eyja.

39:48.287 --> 39:50.162
I'll check it out. Thanks.

39:53.579 --> 39:55.138
- Hi, Eyja.
<i>- Hi.</i>

39:55.162 --> 39:58.889
- Have you seen Hrefna?
<i>- She drove off with someone.</i>

39:58.913 --> 40:03.514
- What? Can you describe the car?
<i>- It was black.</i>

40:03.538 --> 40:06.847
- Was Anna there too?
<i>- Yes.</i>

40:06.871 --> 40:08.747
All right, thanks.

40:10.497 --> 40:13.264
- Anna, what were you thinking?
<i>- What?</i>

40:13.288 --> 40:16.015
You don't just pick up your
sister without letting us know.

40:16.039 --> 40:19.265
<i>Óttar just treated us
to some ice cream.</i>

40:19.289 --> 40:20.973
<i>- I was about to call you.
</i>-Where are you?

40:20.997 --> 40:24.373
We just arrived at the house.
Relax!

40:38.791 --> 40:41.266
- Dad.
- Hi, sweetie.

40:41.290 --> 40:45.309
They let me have sprinkles
on my ice cream.

40:45.333 --> 40:48.725
That's nice. Now go inside.
Mum's waiting.

40:48.749 --> 40:50.309
- Bye, muffin.
- Bye.

40:50.333 --> 40:52.976
Wait, I must give you your invitation
card to my birthday party.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.125
Right. I'll be back in a minute.

40:58.292 --> 41:01.501
- Bye, Hrefna.
- Bye!

41:02.084 --> 41:05.810
- Stay away from Hrefna.
- That was just a warning.

41:05.834 --> 41:08.310
So you'd understand
the mess you're in.

41:08.334 --> 41:10.560
You'll get your three million
and you'll leave us alone.

41:10.584 --> 41:15.769
It was six million, but now they
want street value. So it's twelve.

41:15.793 --> 41:17.561
You owe me nine.

41:17.585 --> 41:19.311
Next time, there'll
be no ice cream.

41:19.335 --> 41:20.770
Are you threatening my child?

41:20.794 --> 41:22.085
I'm not making threats.

41:22.502 --> 41:24.519
But if you need more convincing,

41:24.543 --> 41:29.794
I can check if your wife's
ass is as tight as Anna's.

41:31.378 --> 41:35.002
The house is a total mess.
They had a break-in.

41:35.544 --> 41:37.336
Really?

45:42.478 --> 45:44.621
You'll get your money tomorrow.

45:44.645 --> 45:46.830
Hey, come on.

46:28.231 --> 46:30.149
Why don't we just go someplace?

46:31.024 --> 46:33.606
Get away from all this crap.

46:34.190 --> 46:35.357
Where would we go?

46:36.566 --> 46:39.691
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

46:39.816 --> 46:42.357
Just do it.

46:47.358 --> 46:52.900
It's a game I used to play with
Mum, when she was a bit bluesy.

47:00.318 --> 47:02.942
Open your eyes.

47:05.109 --> 47:08.651
I'm going to spin it.
Give me your finger.

47:08.943 --> 47:12.484
Then you point at
where we'll go to.

47:14.027 --> 47:16.693
- Close your eyes.
- All right.

47:16.985 --> 47:18.652
Point.

47:21.360 --> 47:23.110
Where are we going?

47:23.319 --> 47:27.028
- To Norway... No, let me go again.
- No, look.

47:29.278 --> 47:31.736
We're going to Stavanger.

47:31.861 --> 47:33.962
- Stavanger.
- Yes.

47:33.986 --> 47:35.962
I don't want to go there.

47:35.986 --> 47:38.504
Why not?

47:40.528 --> 47:42.130
It's really nice.

47:42.154 --> 47:45.487
Lots of oil money. They
only work four hours a day.

47:45.945 --> 47:51.154
You even get two years
off, if you have a baby.

48:49.200 --> 48:52.051
- Next case at 1:30, right?
- Yes.

48:52.075 --> 48:53.218
Lunch in the cafeteria?

48:53.242 --> 48:55.260
I'll just grab a
sandwich in my office.

48:55.284 --> 48:58.260
I've got some
paperwork to finish.

48:58.284 --> 49:02.159
- You go, I'll finish up.
- Right.

51:01.667 --> 51:03.876
Go on, piss. Piss.

51:04.043 --> 51:05.709
Óttar!

51:14.168 --> 51:16.519
- Hi.
- Have you got the rest?

51:16.543 --> 51:18.252
Get in.

51:30.378 --> 51:34.670
- Do you have it?
- Yes, but we're not doing this here.

51:43.087 --> 51:44.879
Where are we going?

51:46.837 --> 51:49.837
I don't know if Anna told you,
but she was born prematurely.

51:50.046 --> 51:52.505
It was a very difficult birth.

51:53.046 --> 51:55.962
Her heart stopped beating when
she came into this world.

51:56.088 --> 51:57.939
She almost died.

51:57.963 --> 52:02.089
I would have done anything in my power
to save her, without a second thought.

52:03.713 --> 52:05.130
Do you understand?

52:06.880 --> 52:10.440
- Did you bring the cash?
- It's in the back.

52:10.464 --> 52:12.047
Let's get it done then.

52:14.673 --> 52:16.965
I'll find the right spot.

52:29.091 --> 52:31.174
- What are you doing?
- Strap these on.

52:31.299 --> 52:33.566
First the feet, then the hands.

52:33.590 --> 52:35.192
- Or else?
- Or else?

52:35.216 --> 52:38.049
- Are you going to shoot me?
- If I have to.

52:38.508 --> 52:40.525
You're making things worse.

52:40.549 --> 52:42.469
We're in this together.
We need to pay these men.

52:43.008 --> 52:45.133
Strap them on.

53:07.218 --> 53:09.093
You're fucking crazy.

53:39.762 --> 53:42.845
Get out! Run off!

55:30.603 --> 55:32.311
Damn.

55:41.645 --> 55:43.854
Finnur!

56:33.983 --> 56:36.066
- I've been trying to reach you.
- Sorry.

56:37.191 --> 56:41.543
I took a nap. I didn't
hear the phone ring.

56:41.567 --> 56:43.167
How old is the patient?

56:43.191 --> 56:45.292
- He's nine.
- Damn.

57:05.027 --> 57:06.235
<i>How does it look?</i>

57:07.943 --> 57:11.777
It's a bit narrow.
Wipe the sweat.

57:12.068 --> 57:13.902
But I think I've got it.

57:16.069 --> 57:18.153
<i>The pressure's down to 60.</i>

57:19.278 --> 57:20.902
<i>Check the ultrasound.</i>

57:27.737 --> 57:29.528
Damn.

57:30.403 --> 57:31.570
I perforated it.

57:32.570 --> 57:36.737
<i>- We have to open him.
</i>-Get the OR ready. Now!

57:36.945 --> 57:41.112
We have an emergency. I
need the OR immediately.

58:04.780 --> 58:07.631
His condition is critical, so
we're keeping him unconscious.

58:07.655 --> 58:09.382
But he's stable.

58:09.406 --> 58:13.382
We were told it was a minor operation.
What happened?

58:13.406 --> 58:17.323
- We understand your concern.
- There's always a risk factor.

58:18.406 --> 58:24.782
The operation was more
intrusive than we expected.

58:42.658 --> 58:44.926
- Hello.
<i>- Hi, darling, where are you?</i>

58:44.950 --> 58:47.426
I'm at the hospital. Why?

58:47.450 --> 58:49.326
<i>Are you on your way? The
guests are all here.</i>

58:49.658 --> 58:53.659
- What guests?
<i>- It's Hrefna's birthday.</i>

58:55.909 --> 58:58.242
- Don't tell me you forgot.
<i>- No... No...</i>

58:59.743 --> 59:02.052
Something came up. I
can't make it just yet.

59:02.076 --> 59:03.760
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

59:03.784 --> 59:07.428
- All right, see you soon.
<i>- Bye.</i>

01:00:10.164 --> 01:00:13.915
- Daddy!
- Hello, sweetie.

01:00:16.081 --> 01:00:20.141
- What kept you?
- Surgery, I'll tell you later.

01:00:20.165 --> 01:00:24.558
Daddy, can Eyja sleep over?
Her mum said she could.

01:00:24.582 --> 01:00:29.124
Not now, sweetie.
Some other time.

01:00:30.916 --> 01:00:32.142
Is everything all right?

01:00:32.166 --> 01:00:36.583
Yeah, I'll take a shower
and then I'll join you.

01:00:38.583 --> 01:00:40.249
All right.

01:00:42.791 --> 01:00:46.351
Daddy, did you
forget my birthday?

01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:50.459
No, I was just very
busy at work today.

01:00:51.667 --> 01:00:55.626
And I just forgot to
say "Happy Birthday."

01:00:57.709 --> 01:01:00.293
Happy Birthday.

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:04.543
- Daddy...
- Hmm?

01:01:04.919 --> 01:01:07.502
Don't forget me.

01:01:08.251 --> 01:01:10.460
No, of course not.

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:12.835
Never.

01:01:19.252 --> 01:01:22.252
I'm going for a quick ride.

01:01:53.047 --> 01:01:55.255
Stop it.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:59.672
I've closed the wound.

01:02:00.506 --> 01:02:03.607
If it opens up, I
can't help you.

01:02:03.631 --> 01:02:06.048
I don't have extra blood.

01:02:16.048 --> 01:02:17.507
What do you think you're doing?

01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:21.067
I offered you a deal,
but you didn't take it.

01:02:21.091 --> 01:02:26.257
You said you wouldn't let Anna
go, so here we are. To talk.

01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:44.175
Finnur, let's drop it.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.675
I'll take the heat.

01:02:47.092 --> 01:02:50.926
Just let me go. I
won't go to the cops.

01:02:51.842 --> 01:02:54.009
You know I won't.

01:02:55.842 --> 01:03:00.009
- It's too late to make a deal.
- Are you going to kill me?

01:03:00.218 --> 01:03:03.802
All I know is that I want you
out of my life for good.

01:03:04.802 --> 01:03:06.426
Fuck you.

01:03:08.386 --> 01:03:10.676
Fuck you!

01:03:10.802 --> 01:03:13.427
- All right.
- All right.

01:03:22.886 --> 01:03:24.345
What are you doing?

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:26.844
What is that?

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:31.929
Midazolam and Diazepam. It'll
knock you out until tomorrow.

01:03:32.096 --> 01:03:36.595
But it won't happen instantly.
It'll give you a moment to think.

01:03:41.596 --> 01:03:44.179
- You can't keep me here.
- Why not?

01:03:44.388 --> 01:03:46.572
I have a hospital full of drugs.

01:03:46.596 --> 01:03:50.971
I can knock you out and wake
you up whenever I need to.

01:03:51.763 --> 01:03:53.263
You're not going anywhere.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.347
- They'll look for me.
- And when they don't find you?

01:04:00.263 --> 01:04:04.098
A drug dealer gone missing.
Who cares?

01:04:04.597 --> 01:04:07.056
You're bluffing.

01:04:07.722 --> 01:04:11.223
You'll have time to find out.

01:04:14.139 --> 01:04:18.431
When your muscles start
cramping up tomorrow,

01:04:19.932 --> 01:04:22.599
then you'll know
if I'm bluffing.

01:04:23.099 --> 01:04:25.241
You'll feel it.

01:04:25.265 --> 01:04:27.951
After a few days,
the pain will stop,

01:04:27.975 --> 01:04:32.659
because there's not enough circulation
for the nerves to function.

01:04:32.683 --> 01:04:37.016
Then you'll get bedsores.

01:04:37.266 --> 01:04:39.267
Pressure sores, we call them.

01:04:39.433 --> 01:04:45.225
The body weight pressures
the skin until it cracks.

01:04:46.017 --> 01:04:47.642
Then the pain comes back.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.534
Real pain.

01:04:52.934 --> 01:04:54.226
You're fucking dead!

01:04:57.351 --> 01:04:59.102
Óttar...

01:04:59.351 --> 01:05:04.977
I've seen people on morphine begging
to be put out of their misery.

01:05:05.726 --> 01:05:08.078
Antibiotics wouldn't
do you any good.

01:05:08.102 --> 01:05:11.310
The wounds will get infected, and
you will start rotting alive.

01:05:11.477 --> 01:05:16.144
You're going to smell
your skin rotting.

01:05:16.435 --> 01:05:22.770
And then the flies and worms will
start eating into your flesh...

01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:27.746
You're dead.

01:06:04.398 --> 01:06:07.147
Hi, what's wrong?

01:06:07.565 --> 01:06:08.981
Óttar's gone missing.

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:11.970
What?

01:06:11.982 --> 01:06:14.023
He left this morning
and hasn't come back.

01:06:15.107 --> 01:06:17.315
His phone is turned off.

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:19.524
Nobody knows where he is.

01:06:19.773 --> 01:06:24.583
Then this lady
brought Bull home.

01:06:24.607 --> 01:06:26.357
She said she'd found him and...

01:06:28.774 --> 01:06:34.750
I've looked everywhere and
called all his friends.

01:06:34.774 --> 01:06:37.042
Nobody knows where he is.
He has disappeared.

01:06:37.066 --> 01:06:39.751
Dad, can we call the police
and have them look for him?

01:06:39.775 --> 01:06:42.441
- Anna...
- When did you last hear from him?

01:06:42.775 --> 01:06:48.151
He called around noon and
said he was on his way home.

01:06:48.317 --> 01:06:52.985
- Something must have happened.
- No need to involve the police yet.

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:57.860
If you talked to him at noon,
he might still show up.

01:06:59.568 --> 01:07:03.610
- Why don't you lie down and...
- I can't just lie down.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.111
We'll go to the police
in the morning.

01:07:17.611 --> 01:07:22.236
So the last you heard from him
was when he called from the gym?

01:07:22.570 --> 01:07:24.695
Yes, he said he was
about to take a shower.

01:07:25.028 --> 01:07:29.446
- Did he sound different in any way?
- No.

01:07:29.611 --> 01:07:32.755
I asked if we should have lunch,
and he said he'd bring takeaway.

01:07:32.779 --> 01:07:35.154
- Did he say where?
- No.

01:07:35.279 --> 01:07:38.571
And you haven't heard
from him since?

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:44.672
I called him soon after,
but he didn't answer.

01:07:44.696 --> 01:07:47.423
All right, then there's the dog.

01:07:47.447 --> 01:07:50.321
Yeah, he's tagged. A
woman brought him.

01:07:50.822 --> 01:07:53.321
I've got her number.

01:07:53.780 --> 01:08:00.448
Then you waited for a while before
going to your parents' house?

01:08:01.489 --> 01:08:04.281
- Yeah.
- When was that?

01:08:05.239 --> 01:08:07.197
I'm not sure.

01:08:07.322 --> 01:08:12.073
- Dad?
- After midnight. It was late.

01:08:12.282 --> 01:08:15.425
And you checked up
on him this morning?

01:08:15.449 --> 01:08:17.573
We went to his place earlier.

01:08:17.698 --> 01:08:19.782
We'll get right on it.

01:08:20.282 --> 01:08:24.050
Bye, Dad. Thanks for
coming with me.

01:08:24.073 --> 01:08:26.841
- Are you leaving?
- I'll go and look for him.

01:08:26.866 --> 01:08:28.616
Why don't you come
back to the house?

01:08:28.948 --> 01:08:33.073
Because I don't feel like
just sitting and waiting...

01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:35.616
Can you lend me some cash?

01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:38.426
I need money for my phone,
and taxi and stuff.

01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:40.170
Where are you going? We
can give you a lift.

01:08:40.194 --> 01:08:45.986
No. I'm freaking out. I
need something to relax.

01:08:46.367 --> 01:08:48.801
- Don't bother.
- Anna!

01:08:48.826 --> 01:08:50.676
- What?
- Stay strong.

01:08:50.701 --> 01:08:53.576
Sober up. It only takes a few days
to get through the worst part.

01:08:53.783 --> 01:08:55.658
Oh, God...

01:08:56.285 --> 01:08:57.826
Don't you need the money?

01:08:59.285 --> 01:09:01.035
Anna!

01:09:18.745 --> 01:09:20.929
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:09:20.953 --> 01:09:24.328
My name is Kolbrún.
I'm Óttar's mother.

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:28.953
The police said Anna was here, but
she's not answering her phone.

01:09:30.245 --> 01:09:32.245
- Is she here?
- Who is it?

01:09:32.578 --> 01:09:33.787
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:09:34.287 --> 01:09:40.828
- I'm Óttar's mother.
- I see. Please come in.

01:09:41.828 --> 01:09:44.580
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:09:54.997 --> 01:09:56.122
Is that Anna?

01:09:57.955 --> 01:10:01.414
It's her little sister, Hrefna.

01:10:06.706 --> 01:10:09.248
Here's your coffee.

01:10:16.498 --> 01:10:17.600
Hello.

01:10:17.624 --> 01:10:20.100
<i>- Hi, it's Margrét.
</i>-Hi.

01:10:20.124 --> 01:10:22.374
<i>It's regarding the
boy you operated on.</i>

01:10:23.082 --> 01:10:25.933
The parents want us to
investigate what went wrong.

01:10:25.957 --> 01:10:28.934
Halldór and I will be turning
in a report on Monday.

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:33.101
Good, but I need you to come
down here and meet them.

01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:34.767
Now?

01:10:34.791 --> 01:10:38.916
<i>They're with him now. His
condition is still critical.</i>

01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:41.351
Now is not a good time.

01:10:41.375 --> 01:10:48.375
Make it your priority.
It's important.

01:10:58.710 --> 01:11:01.460
This must be your dad's place.

01:11:03.252 --> 01:11:05.519
Anna said he used to beat
you up when you were a kid.

01:11:05.543 --> 01:11:08.960
Is this where he beat you?
In this house?

01:11:10.628 --> 01:11:13.794
And now you're doing it to me.

01:11:14.461 --> 01:11:17.045
Just like your old man.

01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:19.295
This is too good.

01:12:05.089 --> 01:12:06.465
What about your mother?

01:12:08.798 --> 01:12:12.506
Where was she when
he brought you here?

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:15.174
Didn't she care?

01:12:22.965 --> 01:12:26.174
Was he beating her up too?

01:12:28.799 --> 01:12:31.799
My mum and dad got
divorced when I was five.

01:12:31.925 --> 01:12:33.300
Then Mum met Eric.

01:12:33.633 --> 01:12:37.717
He hated me. I think
he also hated Mum.

01:12:38.634 --> 01:12:43.068
He used to beat the
living shit out of us.

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:44.884
First me.

01:12:45.051 --> 01:12:47.943
Then her.

01:12:47.967 --> 01:12:51.134
Then he'd fuck her.

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:55.343
Pretty nice, huh?

01:12:55.635 --> 01:12:59.569
Lying in bed with a broken nose,
too afraid to get out of bed.

01:12:59.593 --> 01:13:02.219
Listening to them.

01:13:03.093 --> 01:13:05.552
First she cried.

01:13:06.344 --> 01:13:09.803
And then the bed
started creaking.

01:13:11.803 --> 01:13:14.136
Later on...

01:13:14.511 --> 01:13:20.303
I'd lie in bed with a
hard-on, imagining I was him.

01:13:21.261 --> 01:13:23.070
Fucking Mum.

01:13:23.094 --> 01:13:29.179
And then beating her up, for
being with that fucking bastard.

01:13:29.429 --> 01:13:32.179
You know the feeling?

01:13:39.513 --> 01:13:40.697
Hello...

01:13:40.721 --> 01:13:43.989
<i>- Where are you?
</i>- -I'm on my way home. Is something wrong?

01:13:44.013 --> 01:13:46.173
They called from the hospital.
They're looking for you.

01:13:46.197 --> 01:13:48.782
<i>- I thought you were there.
</i>-I was there. What is it?

01:13:48.806 --> 01:13:51.448
<i>Something to do with the
boy you operated on.</i>

01:13:51.472 --> 01:13:53.782
I saw that they called, I
just couldn't pick up.

01:13:53.806 --> 01:13:55.948
<i>Let's talk when I get
home, all right?</i>

01:13:55.972 --> 01:13:58.680
- All right.
<i>- Bye.</i>

01:14:01.181 --> 01:14:02.407
<i>Finnur.</i>

01:14:02.431 --> 01:14:07.574
I'm sorry about all this. I meant
to make things work between us.

01:14:07.598 --> 01:14:10.431
Anna is really
special, you know.

01:14:10.723 --> 01:14:14.783
You have it all, Finnur. I
could never fit in your world.

01:14:14.807 --> 01:14:19.516
You'd never let me. And I know why.
I understand.

01:14:19.891 --> 01:14:22.641
You simply need to get
me out of your way.

01:14:22.766 --> 01:14:26.141
You want to get rid of me
because I'm a fucking loser.

01:14:27.641 --> 01:14:30.433
I'll stay away, Finnur.

01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:33.850
What are you doing?

01:14:34.809 --> 01:14:37.785
Hey, here's how we do it.

01:14:37.809 --> 01:14:39.160
I have a guarantee for you.

01:14:39.184 --> 01:14:43.101
There's a locker at the gym.
My locker.

01:14:43.309 --> 01:14:44.476
Number 389.

01:14:45.101 --> 01:14:47.559
It has a padlock, 667.

01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:54.119
There's a kilo of coke in it. I got
it on credit to pay back your debt.

01:14:54.143 --> 01:14:57.018
If you flush it down the
toilet, you'll get rid of me.

01:14:57.227 --> 01:15:01.578
I'd have to leave the
country, or I'd be dead meat.

01:15:01.602 --> 01:15:02.952
What's the number?

01:15:02.976 --> 01:15:05.894
Locker 389...

01:15:06.061 --> 01:15:08.936
Padlock 667.

01:15:09.686 --> 01:15:11.395
I'm personally
responsible for it.

01:15:12.395 --> 01:15:15.436
I can't pay them back fifteen million.
Not a chance.

01:15:16.603 --> 01:15:18.496
What about the flat and the car?

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.954
I don't own any of that shit.

01:15:19.978 --> 01:15:23.371
You can buy me a plane ticket
and drive me to the airport,

01:15:23.395 --> 01:15:25.937
- and you'll never see me again.
- Where would you go?

01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:29.205
To my dad, in Norway.

01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:31.664
Your dad lives in Norway?

01:15:31.688 --> 01:15:35.622
Yeah. He can get me a job.
I can start over.

01:15:35.646 --> 01:15:40.438
I don't want to die. I want
to get away from all this.

01:15:40.604 --> 01:15:43.063
- So, your dad lives in Norway?
- Yes, he does.

01:15:43.188 --> 01:15:44.647
Where in Norway?

01:15:46.063 --> 01:15:49.230
Stavanger. He lives
in Stavanger.

01:15:56.564 --> 01:15:59.773
- Can I trust you?
- Yes, I'm telling you the truth.

01:16:00.106 --> 01:16:01.523
I promise.

01:16:05.815 --> 01:16:10.315
- I promise.
- You'd better not be lying.

01:16:10.607 --> 01:16:14.732
I'm telling the truth, I swear.
I'll go. Please listen.

01:16:14.857 --> 01:16:16.750
Not again.

01:16:16.774 --> 01:16:20.983
Don't give me more of that shit.
Please, I can't take it.

01:16:22.358 --> 01:16:24.816
Finnur.

01:16:25.108 --> 01:16:27.525
Please, Finnur.

01:16:29.692 --> 01:16:31.775
Finnur.

01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.692
I promise I'll go.

01:16:38.025 --> 01:16:41.359
- Did you get hold of Finnur?
- He's still not answering.

01:16:42.609 --> 01:16:44.609
- Keep trying!
- Yes.

01:18:04.531 --> 01:18:07.490
- Halldór is trying to stop the bleeding.
- I'm going in there.

01:18:07.615 --> 01:18:11.407
No, you're not. If you participate
and something goes wrong...

01:18:11.532 --> 01:18:14.758
I'm the best surgeon for this.
You know it.

01:18:14.782 --> 01:18:15.824
Listen...

01:18:15.949 --> 01:18:19.491
Sue me, fire me, take my license.
But I'm going in there.

01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:26.408
Put up my loops.

01:18:26.992 --> 01:18:28.241
About time you showed up!

01:18:28.449 --> 01:18:30.825
How's it going?

01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:33.634
- I'm struggling with this bleeding.
- Let me take a look.

01:18:33.658 --> 01:18:35.576
- Go deeper.
- I can't because of the vena cava.

01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:38.159
Sure you can. Much deeper.

01:18:38.284 --> 01:18:40.534
What do you think I've been
doing for the past hour?

01:18:40.659 --> 01:18:43.492
Stay focused. Hold it tight.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.000
The bleeding is out of control.
I'm losing him.

01:18:50.451 --> 01:18:52.493
Don't panic. We'll manage.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:53.940
- I'm losing him!
- Don't let go.

01:18:53.964 --> 01:18:57.214
- I'm losing him!
- I'm taking over.

01:18:59.410 --> 01:19:02.077
Adjust the light.

01:19:02.869 --> 01:19:05.387
We're almost there.

01:19:05.411 --> 01:19:07.077
Cut.

01:19:16.203 --> 01:19:18.203
The operation went well.

01:19:18.537 --> 01:19:22.620
We stopped the bleeding, so
things are looking good.

01:19:46.122 --> 01:19:49.306
- Hello.
<i>- Birna here, with the police.</i>

01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:50.640
Hi.

01:19:50.664 --> 01:19:53.473
I've been trying to call Anna,
but she's not answering.

01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:55.974
<i>I haven't heard from her either.
Any news?</i>

01:19:55.998 --> 01:19:58.974
<i>I was wondering if you could
come meet me at the station.</i>

01:19:58.998 --> 01:20:00.224
Now?

01:20:00.248 --> 01:20:03.141
- It would be helpful.
<i>- All right. I'll be there.</i>

01:20:03.165 --> 01:20:06.498
Thank you. Bye.

01:20:34.542 --> 01:20:39.351
The photos are blurry, but do you
recognize the car or the driver?

01:20:39.375 --> 01:20:41.293
Let's see.

01:20:42.667 --> 01:20:43.834
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:20:48.251 --> 01:20:51.394
I don't recognize the car,

01:20:51.418 --> 01:20:54.835
and you can't really
make out the driver.

01:20:57.210 --> 01:21:02.228
- Don't you have better photos?
- I'm afraid not.

01:21:02.252 --> 01:21:03.669
Well...

01:21:07.377 --> 01:21:09.645
You can see the
number plate, right?

01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:12.937
It's fake. From another car.

01:21:12.961 --> 01:21:15.854
No traffic cameras?

01:21:15.878 --> 01:21:19.187
We're looking into it.

01:21:19.211 --> 01:21:21.771
You and Óttar were in contact.

01:21:21.795 --> 01:21:24.230
- I wouldn't say so.
- Really?

01:21:24.254 --> 01:21:31.004
We have his phone records. You've
been calling him recently.

01:21:33.379 --> 01:21:35.671
Well...

01:21:36.796 --> 01:21:41.130
Probably just to
get hold of Anna.

01:21:41.796 --> 01:21:46.172
There's nothing you
want to tell us?

01:21:47.005 --> 01:21:50.380
No, I don't think so.

01:21:52.589 --> 01:21:57.506
This is just a formality, but
where were you at noon on Friday?

01:21:57.839 --> 01:21:59.131
Oh.

01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:03.715
I was in surgery
at the hospital.

01:22:04.465 --> 01:22:05.524
Mm-hmm.

01:22:05.548 --> 01:22:08.132
Who can verify that?

01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:12.674
Why?

01:22:13.633 --> 01:22:15.132
Am I a suspect?

01:22:15.257 --> 01:22:18.633
We're just eliminating
all the possibilities.

01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:36.055
I didn't want this!

01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:40.764
This is not what I wanted!

01:23:54.431 --> 01:23:56.431
No...

01:23:57.139 --> 01:23:59.514
Óttar!

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.517
Yes.

01:24:24.683 --> 01:24:26.558
Come on.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.183
Óttar.

01:26:06.190 --> 01:26:07.249
What's happening?

01:26:07.273 --> 01:26:08.917
He was found in the parking lot.

01:26:08.941 --> 01:26:11.666
Weak pulse, head trauma and
traces of white powder.

01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:13.816
Quick! Contact trauma
and neurosurgeons.

01:26:14.274 --> 01:26:16.690
Get the CT ready, he might
have a brain hemorrhage.

01:26:18.108 --> 01:26:21.775
All we know is that he was found
in the parking lot, all messed up.

01:26:22.942 --> 01:26:24.025
Weak pulse.

01:26:24.691 --> 01:26:28.025
Cut here, we have
abdominal trauma.

01:26:28.317 --> 01:26:30.293
There's no pulse.

01:26:32.692 --> 01:26:35.001
- He's all stitched up.
- What the hell...

01:26:35.025 --> 01:26:37.818
Insert an IV cannula and hook
him to the monitor. Now!

01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:44.526
We have to defibrillate.

01:26:50.652 --> 01:26:51.753
Clear, and...

01:27:00.194 --> 01:27:02.528
- He's coming back...
- He's coming!

01:27:03.444 --> 01:27:05.069
Come on.

01:27:06.111 --> 01:27:07.379
He's responding...

01:27:07.403 --> 01:27:09.569
I think he's coming back.

01:27:12.445 --> 01:27:14.445
Are you with us?

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:16.861
Come on.

01:27:30.029 --> 01:27:31.196
No pulse.

01:27:32.071 --> 01:27:33.923
Try again.

01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:40.697
- Adrenaline.
- Adrenaline.

01:27:42.863 --> 01:27:44.738
Come on!

01:27:46.823 --> 01:27:48.197
Finnur.

01:27:49.614 --> 01:27:51.614
Finnur.

01:28:33.450 --> 01:28:36.201
<i>I was monitoring a patient
who underwent surgery.</i>

01:28:36.409 --> 01:28:38.969
I saw the fire outside
and went downstairs.

01:28:38.993 --> 01:28:40.535
Then I realized it was him.

01:28:41.201 --> 01:28:43.344
So you didn't just
happen to be here?

01:28:43.368 --> 01:28:45.886
No, I was on call.

01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:47.576
I work here.

01:28:47.868 --> 01:28:50.535
- And you were here from...
- I was here the whole day.

01:28:50.702 --> 01:28:53.761
Except when I came to see
you at the police station.

01:28:53.785 --> 01:28:55.702
- Then I came back here.
- Right.

01:28:56.536 --> 01:28:59.619
Sorry, but Anna just called.
She's on her way.

01:28:59.744 --> 01:29:01.411
I'll be right there.

01:29:01.536 --> 01:29:03.911
- Are we done?
- For the time being.

01:29:17.412 --> 01:29:20.079
- Anna.
- Where is he?

01:29:20.954 --> 01:29:23.704
- I want to talk to him.
- He's gone.

01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:26.829
- What?
- He's gone, sweetie.

01:29:27.413 --> 01:29:29.663
There was nothing we could do.

01:29:36.122 --> 01:29:38.455
There's nothing we can do.

01:29:42.622 --> 01:29:44.205
Let's go home.

01:30:38.710 --> 01:30:41.811
I'll call the rehab center and check
if they can take her in today.

01:30:41.835 --> 01:30:45.543
<i>She's still sleeping. Let
me know what they say.</i>

01:30:46.585 --> 01:30:48.543
I will.

01:30:57.502 --> 01:30:59.169
It's a 2003 Ford Explorer.

01:31:00.794 --> 01:31:05.211
Get a picture of that shoe
print from this angle.

01:31:11.336 --> 01:31:13.004
What's going on, Finnur?

01:31:13.128 --> 01:31:15.354
Why are the police asking
questions about you?

01:31:15.378 --> 01:31:18.837
- What did they ask?
- If you were on call last night.

01:31:19.087 --> 01:31:20.272
What did you say?

01:31:20.296 --> 01:31:22.439
That you were here when I left.

01:31:22.463 --> 01:31:24.021
Anything else?

01:31:24.045 --> 01:31:27.480
They asked if you were here
between operations, on Friday.

01:31:27.504 --> 01:31:29.897
I was here. You
told them, right?

01:31:29.921 --> 01:31:32.963
Yes, but I didn't see you
until the second operation.

01:31:33.088 --> 01:31:34.589
I was here. You know I was.

01:31:38.630 --> 01:31:41.380
INFECTIOUS WASTE
TO BE INCINERATED

01:31:50.756 --> 01:31:55.840
<i>Tell me, fortune-teller,
what I ask.</i>

01:31:56.381 --> 01:32:00.358
With gold I'll reward you
if you tell me the truth.

01:32:00.382 --> 01:32:03.591
But with fire I'll
burn you if...

01:32:10.049 --> 01:32:12.233
You're registered
for two firearms.

01:32:12.257 --> 01:32:16.025
- That's correct.
- Can we take a look?

01:32:16.049 --> 01:32:18.401
Sure...

01:32:18.425 --> 01:32:20.942
They're in a cabinet
in the garage.

01:32:20.966 --> 01:32:22.467
Go check it out, please.

01:32:23.049 --> 01:32:26.633
Do you happen to have
sneakers like these?

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:32.027
No, I don't.

01:32:32.051 --> 01:32:36.760
Are you sure? Take
a closer look.

01:32:41.676 --> 01:32:44.885
No, I've never had
shoes like that.

01:34:19.725 --> 01:34:21.784
You're under arrest

01:34:21.808 --> 01:34:24.725
on suspicion of murdering
Óttar Kolbrúnarson.

01:34:25.351 --> 01:34:27.535
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:34:27.559 --> 01:34:33.243
Anything you say may be used against you.
You have the right to a lawyer.

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:34.684
Is this clear?

01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:39.744
Are you sure you
don't want a lawyer?

01:34:39.768 --> 01:34:42.768
I don't need one. I was at the
hospital when they brought him in.

01:34:43.352 --> 01:34:50.226
Everybody cracks in the end.
We'll come across mistakes.

01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:55.995
We'll continue to investigate all the
details until we figure out what happened.

01:34:56.019 --> 01:34:57.436
You'll crack.

01:34:58.561 --> 01:35:01.269
I've got kids. I can
understand why you did it.

01:35:01.853 --> 01:35:03.645
But it's hopeless.

01:35:22.979 --> 01:35:24.438
All right.

01:35:27.271 --> 01:35:32.539
Let's talk about the
money you gave him.

01:35:34.521 --> 01:35:37.438
- Like I told you before...
- Yeah.

01:35:37.563 --> 01:35:40.855
- I gave him the money...
- A lot of money.

01:35:41.897 --> 01:35:44.856
I gave him the money, so
he'd stay away from Anna.

01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:47.415
Right, but he didn't.

01:35:47.439 --> 01:35:50.273
And that's when you
decided to kill him.

01:36:09.358 --> 01:36:11.399
Not pellets, but cut-off nails.

01:36:11.691 --> 01:36:15.149
Then some time passes.
Days. He's alive.

01:36:15.858 --> 01:36:19.584
Tied up. We can tell by
the marks on his hands.

01:36:19.608 --> 01:36:22.502
- Maybe he was thinking of you.
- Take a seat.

01:36:22.526 --> 01:36:24.084
- Dad.
- What's going on?

01:36:24.108 --> 01:36:25.788
He was alive when you
went looking for him.

01:36:26.484 --> 01:36:30.126
He was alive when you
reported him missing,

01:36:30.150 --> 01:36:33.543
- and when you went looking...
- What the hell are you doing?

01:36:33.567 --> 01:36:35.207
He didn't want you to
be together, did he?

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:37.710
No, but...

01:36:37.734 --> 01:36:39.336
Has he told you that
he tried bribing him

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.461
- so he'd break up with you?
- Just stop it.

01:36:41.485 --> 01:36:45.527
Just tell us what happened.
Do the right thing.

01:36:45.735 --> 01:36:47.212
Please stop.

01:36:47.236 --> 01:36:49.961
You're right. I didn't
want him around Anna.

01:36:49.985 --> 01:36:51.628
I offered him money.
I didn't want this.

01:36:51.652 --> 01:36:54.545
You wanted to save your
daughter, but you lost control.

01:36:54.569 --> 01:36:56.545
- You can't do this.
- You murdered him.

01:36:56.569 --> 01:36:58.861
No, I did not.

01:37:00.028 --> 01:37:02.254
I want a lawyer now.

01:37:02.278 --> 01:37:05.504
See, look at his face.

01:37:05.528 --> 01:37:06.796
- Stop it.
- His lips.

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:09.220
- What was the last thing he said to you?
- I can't remember.

01:37:09.244 --> 01:37:11.421
- Stop it, I want a lawyer.
- He did it for you!

01:37:11.445 --> 01:37:12.654
Birna.

01:37:13.529 --> 01:37:16.113
We'll take a break.

01:37:24.987 --> 01:37:28.279
We can't continue like this.
He's asked for a lawyer.

01:37:28.404 --> 01:37:32.488
We don't have enough evidence.
His alibi checks out.

01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:36.822
I know, but we can't
rule him out yet.

01:37:46.489 --> 01:37:49.115
I apologize. I was out of line.

01:37:49.572 --> 01:37:54.591
But if anything comes to mind.
Anything he said or...

01:37:54.615 --> 01:37:57.407
He was cleaning up his act.

01:37:57.949 --> 01:38:00.865
He wanted to quit. We
were planning to go away.

01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:06.116
He told me that he had plans
to join his father in Norway.

01:38:06.699 --> 01:38:09.966
I think he was being
threatened by some thugs.

01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:11.592
I think he said Stavanger.

01:38:11.616 --> 01:38:14.783
We'll look into that. Did
he say who they were?

01:38:15.242 --> 01:38:18.658
No, maybe he was in
some kind of trouble.

01:38:19.409 --> 01:38:22.468
He had obviously been in a fight.
His face was bruised.

01:38:22.492 --> 01:38:26.176
Perhaps he owed someone money.
You know how these things go.

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.450
I see.

01:38:44.743 --> 01:38:47.411
When did you talk to him?

01:38:48.743 --> 01:38:50.661
When did he tell you
about his dad in Norway?

01:38:51.577 --> 01:38:56.970
His dad is just a loser, who's never
been abroad. Never gave a shit.

01:38:56.994 --> 01:38:59.494
He didn't even come
to the funeral.

01:38:59.661 --> 01:39:02.286
- Anna...
- Don't lie to me, Dad.

01:39:02.994 --> 01:39:05.328
The night before he disappeared,

01:39:07.203 --> 01:39:10.079
we joked about going abroad.

01:39:10.954 --> 01:39:13.495
He had this globe.

01:39:15.496 --> 01:39:20.705
I randomly pointed my finger
at Stavanger, Norway.

01:39:27.788 --> 01:39:30.788
So he must have told you
after he went missing.

01:39:32.622 --> 01:39:35.163
I did it to save you.

01:39:39.414 --> 01:39:41.789
I didn't want to lose you.

01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:47.707
He was ruining you.

01:39:52.415 --> 01:39:54.498
He loved me.

01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:01.290
Anna.

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:06.916
Anna!

01:40:08.541 --> 01:40:10.457
Anna, please.

01:40:18.375 --> 01:40:20.542
Talk to me.
