00:06.074 --> 00:07.641
Previously on ER:

00:07.675 --> 00:09.577
This is Dr. McNulty,
formerly of Curtain Two.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.213
He needs a head CT, CBC,
chem seven, urinalysis.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.647
When's the last time
you had a tetanus shot?

00:13.681 --> 00:14.782
1949.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.351
You have a license for this?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.689
Why'd you get
beat up?

00:21.722 --> 00:23.491
I didn't have the gun
when they asked for it.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.494
We got to get it back, G.
They want it.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.063
I can't find
the heartbeat.

00:29.097 --> 00:31.065
Here, let me try.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.501
It's not there.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.537
I'm sorry.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.445
PRATT:
He's a hard worker,
he's strong

00:44.478 --> 00:45.679
he's got a great attitude.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.548
How's he going to work
with a bad hand?

00:47.581 --> 00:48.682
It don't hurt.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.384
Cast will be off
in three weeks.

00:50.418 --> 00:51.419
Cool, G.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.121
You said six before.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.722
I've seen you around, right?

00:54.755 --> 00:55.856
You, uh, work upstairs?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.425
Yeah, I'm an
ER resident.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.093
All part of
the County family.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.661
I hate doctors.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.331
You all think you're the queen
of the damn Rose Parade.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.366
I'm not a doctor.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.835
Not the sharpest nail
in the box.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.638
Just give him a chance.
You'll see.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.275
Okay, kid, let's talk.

01:14.308 --> 01:15.409
Alone.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.511
All right, look.
Listen, listen.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.779
I got to get back
down to the ER.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.614
Now you make sure
that you tell him

01:20.648 --> 01:21.782
that you work
real hard, okay?

01:21.815 --> 01:22.750
Okay, G.

01:22.783 --> 01:23.751
I'll see you at home.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.153
Right.
All right.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.689
I work real hard.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.531
I don't want to be here.

01:37.565 --> 01:38.466
Sand truck rolled on I-40.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.168
Three DOAs at the scene.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.603
Jessie Callahan, 35-year-old
restrained passenger.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.172
High speed T-bone,
BP 122/78.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.374
Pulse 93, bloody scalp lac,
she got a liter.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.308
Okay, Trauma One.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.576
Where's Tom?

01:48.609 --> 01:49.877
Jessie, can you tell me
where it hurts you?

01:49.910 --> 01:52.280
I left Tom, I left
him all alone.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.581
Her husband's still
in the car.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.915
Fire department's
cutting him out.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.185
Paramedics are working
on your husband, Jessie.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.719
You got to let us
help you though, okay?

01:58.752 --> 02:00.388
So just Neosporin on
the abrasion or what?

02:00.421 --> 02:01.722
Yeah, and tell him
to stop for a while

02:01.755 --> 02:03.291
or he's literally
going to jerk it off.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.525
JERRY:
Dr. Lewis.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.327
Paramedics pulling in
with a fall.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.496
Okay. Oh, Jerry, could you call
those morons in engineering

02:08.529 --> 02:10.198
and tell them to get down here?

02:10.198 --> 02:12.466
We're okay.
Nobody panic,
nobody panic.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.601
And call psych.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.503
The sun goes down,
the nuts come out.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.537
Are we ready for him?

02:16.570 --> 02:17.638
Who?

02:17.671 --> 02:18.539
The alderman.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.574
( shouting )

02:20.608 --> 02:22.676
Back up, you can't
come in here.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.445
Keep them back.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.448
John Bright, 55, eight
foot fall of a stage.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.782
It was a dais.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.419
BP 124/82, pulse 79.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.288
No LOC, complains of neck,
hip and right knee pain.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.224
Alderman, it's an honor
to have you here.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.425
I'm Dr. Kerry Weaver.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.926
Are you taking
any medications, sir?

02:38.959 --> 02:41.462
No and call me John.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.696
Gently, people.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.333
CBC, chem panel,
type and hold UA.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.234
Chest is clear.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.835
Chest, chest is clear.

02:47.868 --> 02:52.540
All right, pupils
four millimeters
and reactive.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.707
Who are you
on the phone with?

02:53.741 --> 02:54.642
Uh, the office.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.609
She's my assistant.

02:55.643 --> 02:56.677
Jennifer, try to breathe.

02:56.710 --> 02:57.678
You need to shut
that cell phone

02:57.711 --> 02:58.746
off when
you're in here.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.780
You're welcome
to use

02:59.813 --> 03:00.648
our phones if you'd like.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.384
Just dial nine.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.618
You don't
have to answer that, sir.

03:04.652 --> 03:05.586
No, I haven't.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.620
I'm on the program.

03:06.654 --> 03:07.821
Just got my two year chip.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.323
Okay, then.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.292
Open wide and stick out
your tongue.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.693
Okay, don't worry,
sir.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.962
You're in the finest
hospital in Chicago.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.968
Okay.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:12.586 --> 04:15.489
CARTER:
The emergency power will
kick on in a second.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.423
Let there be light.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.524
Shooting.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.827
Thank God something's working.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.762
Get that into exam two,
move it.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.564
Jessie, we're going to take
a scan of your belly

04:23.597 --> 04:25.433
to make sure you're
not bleeding internally.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.534
Is Tom here yet?

04:26.567 --> 04:27.835
We'll find out
for you.

04:27.868 --> 04:28.869
Come on, get the lead out.

04:28.902 --> 04:29.937
We got a VIP customer waiting.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.814
Leon, come on,
what are you doing?

04:40.848 --> 04:41.849
I work here.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.451
Me, too, G.
I got the job.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.018
Okay, good.
It's cool,
man.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.521
Hey, hey, this
is Dr. Weaver in the ER.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.056
Get, get your
fat union asses

04:49.089 --> 04:50.824
down here and fix the power.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.426
I got the job.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.362
We're going to be
working together, man.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.363
Pratt.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.697
Hey, kiss your
friend good-bye

04:56.730 --> 04:57.665
and get back to work.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.099
Hello?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.668
Damn it. Hello?

05:00.701 --> 05:01.902
LEON:
It's all going
to work out

05:01.935 --> 05:03.637
just the way
it's supposed to.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.905
Okay, I get
the overtime...

05:04.938 --> 05:06.039
Hey, Leon, how's
it going?

05:06.073 --> 05:06.874
I got a job.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.108
Glad to hear it.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.577
She's stable,
but I want you to check

05:09.610 --> 05:10.878
another hemocue before
you send her to CT.

05:10.911 --> 05:11.512
She may need some blood.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.580
Okay.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.647
You ain't got
nothing, man.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.015
You got nothing
to worry about.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.750
After I get off,
we'll go to Mario's

05:16.784 --> 05:18.486
we'll get some pizza
and we'll celebrate.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.087
No, G, I'm working tonight.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.755
On the late shift.
Tonight?

05:21.789 --> 05:23.857
I even get my own uniform.
Isn't that cool?

05:23.891 --> 05:25.526
And you know where
to pick it up from?

05:25.559 --> 05:27.495
Yo, I got the address
and everything.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.462
They wrote it down.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.663
I could find it
by myself.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.964
All right, good.
Congratulations.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.566
Quit worrying, man.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.001
We're going to be working
together, man.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.068
We'll be working together.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.504
Shh. Shh.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.872
All right, G.
I'll see you later, man.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.408
JENNIFER:
Work on a press release

05:40.408 --> 05:41.475
and fax it over.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.444
Somebody get me a fax number.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.714
All right, engineering is coming
down now to work on the power.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.015
How are you feeling, Alderman?

05:48.048 --> 05:49.417
Pampered.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.619
I'm sure you have
other patients.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.921
This ER sees about 90,000
a year, doesn't it?

05:53.954 --> 05:55.889
Mm, that's why
I'm tired all the time.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.858
More like 110,000.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.427
It's a damn miracle
what you people do.

05:59.427 --> 06:00.861
We have a great team
but we could do more

06:00.894 --> 06:02.830
if we had better resources.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.832
No medial or lateral
instability.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.535
You probably tore a ligament
when you fell.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.604
There goes my dream of
being an Olympic gymnast.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.805
I'll page Dr. Hullverson.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.874
He's our top orthopedist.
Excellent.

06:13.907 --> 06:14.775
Give the alderman

06:14.808 --> 06:15.943
six of morphine.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.745
We should see
a tox screen first.

06:17.778 --> 06:18.479
What?

06:18.512 --> 06:19.780
Who are you?

06:19.813 --> 06:21.649
Was it cocaine, Alderman?

06:21.682 --> 06:23.551
Oh, my God.
What?

06:23.584 --> 06:24.918
Ray MacGee,
Chicago Times...
Get out.

06:24.952 --> 06:25.986
I have a right
to be here.

06:26.019 --> 06:26.987
Leave this man alone.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.456
This is a hospital.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.190
Have you ever heard
of the First Amendment?

06:30.223 --> 06:32.159
Have you ever heard
of an awake colonoscopy?

06:32.192 --> 06:35.463
Wherever you stole that scrub
top from, I want it back.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.731
Jerry, can you try and
keep out the fake nurses?

06:37.765 --> 06:39.500
So many rules
to remember.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.133
Fake nurses?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.869
Uh, don't ask.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.805
Don't we have enough trouble
with the real ones?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.574
Ah, looks busy.

06:46.607 --> 06:47.575
Lucky you.

06:47.608 --> 06:48.942
Yeah, I hate nights.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.210
MVA coming in,
two minutes.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.745
Is that from the I-40
pile up?

06:51.779 --> 06:53.180
Yeah, it's
that lady's husband.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.849
I'm off. Can you make sure
somebody finds her if it is?

06:55.883 --> 06:57.050
Sure.
Good.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.486
Ooh, hot date?

06:58.519 --> 07:00.921
No, I got to give a check

07:00.954 --> 07:02.890
at this symphony
fund raiser thing.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.493
Lifestyles of the rich
and famous, baby.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.227
Hey, look what the patient
fairy brought you.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.829
( chuckling ):
No.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.900
Mrs. Hawkes, 44, fever,
cough times three days.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.902
I'm juggling
ten patients already.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.570
I'm just waiting
for a chest film.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.839
If it comes back clear,
just write a little scrip

07:18.872 --> 07:20.207
send her home,
easy dispo.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.842
Okay, good,
it's probably just the flu.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.210
Give it to Pratt. He'll hate it.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.512
Done.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.513
Ten minutes.

07:25.513 --> 07:26.814
Oh, you two
have fun.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.849
So you're sure
you want to go?

07:28.882 --> 07:29.850
Definitely.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.051
Free canapés.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.521
What is a canapé, anyway?

07:33.554 --> 07:36.624
Don't worry, I'll use
the right fork.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.859
Next time,
we'll do something fun.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.529
Next time, we'll do something
that you want to do.

07:41.562 --> 07:44.264
Oh, you mean, like,
miniature golf or bowling?

07:44.297 --> 07:45.999
Things my people
enjoy doing?

07:46.033 --> 07:47.668
It's too bad Cats closed.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.669
I'll just shut up now.

07:48.702 --> 07:49.937
( whistling )

07:49.970 --> 07:51.539
That's sexual harassment,
isn't it?

07:51.539 --> 07:52.740
You bet.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.041
I'm going to circulate
a petition.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.710
Excuse me.
Dr. Carter, right?

07:56.744 --> 07:57.945
I'm Sarah Wilson.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.813
I work with Dr. Mac.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.282
Um, you called the clinic,
said he needed to come back.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.018
Oh, yeah, he left before
his chem panel came back.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.954
Oh, he's dizzy,
he's dehydrated

08:06.987 --> 08:09.122
and I'm worried
about his diabetes.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.124
Yeah, well, he really
needs to come in.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.993
Well, there are always
patients at the clinic.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.562
He won't leave them.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.163
Uh-huh, and there's nobody
to cover for him?

08:16.196 --> 08:17.631
Well, he's a one-man show.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.266
10:00 to 10:00,
seven days a week.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.768
Another one from
the pileup.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.202
Pulse 110,
20-minute extrication.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.737
Take a deep breath,
Mr. Callahan.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.272
My wife, Jessie...

08:25.305 --> 08:26.874
Yeah, Mr. Callahan,
she's here, she's stable

08:26.907 --> 08:28.141
and we'll make sure
that somebody knows

08:28.175 --> 08:29.910
that you're looking for her.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.279
I need you to come down to
the clinic and talk to him.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.047
What makes you think he's
going to listen to me?

08:34.081 --> 08:35.215
Well, he likes you.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.950
Sure had a good way
of hiding it.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.587
He's going
to kill himself.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.589
He won't listen to me.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.890
Stop by, please.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.859
Carter!
Just for
a minute.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.094
They're calling
for anesthesiology

08:47.127 --> 08:48.295
back up in Scanner Two.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.897
That's Pratt's
patient.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.765
Jessie Callahan.
She crashed on the CT table.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.667
Will you come?

08:53.701 --> 08:56.169
Uh, if you leave the address
at the desk, I'll try.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.705
She might not
even make it down.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.206
Prep the rapid infuser
in Trauma One.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.882
Pneumonia. Her right lobe's
complete socked in.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.350
So much for
an easy dispo.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.819
Did you run labs?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.921
White count was 27,000
with a left shift.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.656
Gram negative rods
in the sputum.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.057
Call ICU.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.927
It's got to be klebsiella
or pseudomonis, right?

09:19.960 --> 09:22.029
Yeah. Not good.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.632
Sats are only 85
on two liters.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.767
Okay, crank her
up to five liters
nasal cannula

09:26.800 --> 09:28.268
and get a gram of
cefotaxime IV

09:28.301 --> 09:29.202
and 500 of biaxin.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.138
( coughing )

09:31.171 --> 09:32.840
This is Dr. Lewis.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.676
I've never had flu this bad.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.944
She's coughing a lot.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.646
Do you guys
have any cough medicine?

09:38.679 --> 09:40.848
We're giving her all
the medicine we can right now.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.783
I need to talk to your mom
for a minute, okay?

09:42.816 --> 09:46.219
Hey, you guys
want a soda?

09:46.253 --> 09:47.921
Go on.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.827
Is our mom really sick?

09:53.861 --> 09:54.928
Well, she has pneumonia.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.764
It's a serious disease

09:56.797 --> 09:58.766
but we're doing
everything that we can.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.167
We should call...

10:00.200 --> 10:02.770
No, Mom would freak.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.005
Call who?

10:05.038 --> 10:07.374
Doug. He's our brother.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.242
Does he
live with you?

10:09.276 --> 10:10.678
No, he's 20.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.780
He has, like,
50 earrings.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.214
I just need some sleep.

10:14.247 --> 10:17.250
You know, Marten never
should have called 911.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.952
Well, I'm glad he did.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.821
This type of pneumonia's
very dangerous.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.923
My kids have homework,
they need dinner...

10:22.956 --> 10:26.293
Mrs. Hawkes, you're too sick
to leave the hospital.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.862
Write me a prescription.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.297
I'll get it filled
on the way home.

10:30.330 --> 10:34.367
If we take you off the medicine,
you will probably die.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.804
Is there anyone
we can call?

10:36.837 --> 10:38.872
A relative to be here with you?

10:38.906 --> 10:40.808
Someone to watch
your kids?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.710
My husband died last year.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.413
My Aunt Sarah.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.982
She lives in Detroit.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.151
But what about your son, Doug?

10:51.184 --> 10:53.854
No, I don't want him here.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.288
I don't want him near my kids.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.324
Is there anyone else
nearby we can call?

10:57.357 --> 10:58.992
No.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.862
I'll call Sarah.
She'll come.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.196
CHUNY:
Pratt!

11:03.230 --> 11:04.231
Carter needs you now.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.900
Your MVA, she crashed in CT.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.836
CARTER:
Charge to 360.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.170
All right, clear.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.238
Still in V-fib.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.405
Another milligram
of epi.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.774
Let's charge
again to 360.

11:13.807 --> 11:14.842
What happened?
Shut up and bag.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.076
What was the second
hemocue?

11:16.109 --> 11:17.110
Did you check it?

11:17.144 --> 11:18.045
Yes, I did.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.046
Coarse v-fib.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.748
All right,
and clear.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.382
Let's go.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.820
Sats dropping to 91.

11:26.854 --> 11:27.788
Push the lido.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.322
Ten blade, say it.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.457
Ten blade.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.825
Can you find
my wife?

11:31.859 --> 11:33.293
We will, Mr. Callahan.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.161
Right down to the rib.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.362
Curved peon clamp next.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.864
Pressure's falling
down to 80.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.398
Okay, elbow up.

11:39.867 --> 11:40.834
Push harder.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.035
Lean with
your hip.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.971
Okay, tension pneumo.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.874
Line's in, let's hook up
two units of O-neg.

11:46.907 --> 11:47.941
Okay, pressure's coming up.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.912
Nice work.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.981
Malik, hook up
the thoraseal.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.448
O silk on a driver
and Vaseline gauze.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.950
What do you have?

11:56.984 --> 11:58.786
Tension pneumo with
intraperitoneal blood.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.888
Oh, yeah, ex-lap.
Don't even bother to scan him.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.856
Come on upstairs, sir,
where the good drugs are.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.958
Mr. Callahan, you're
bleeding in your belly.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.894
You need an operation.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.428
Is that Jessie?

12:08.461 --> 12:11.799
Yes, the other
doctor

12:11.799 --> 12:12.933
is taking
care of her

12:12.966 --> 12:14.301
but we need to take you
up to surgery.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.837
I just want to see her.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.872
I need to know she's all right.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.543
One minute, okay?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.245
PRATT:
No pulse,
no pressure.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.147
She should never
have left the department.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.882
She's got a huge
retroperitoneal bleed.

12:28.916 --> 12:29.883
Carter?
Not now, Luka.

12:29.917 --> 12:30.884
Mag and
bicarb are in.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.519
Round four.
Jessie!

12:32.552 --> 12:34.121
Can you close that door?

12:35.522 --> 12:36.489
V-fib. Shock again?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.058
Yeah, charge 360 stacked.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.359
Charged.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.261
All right, everybody, clear.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.365
Looks like sinus.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.834
No pulse. It's PEA.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.435
How long?

12:48.468 --> 12:49.970
Ten minutes.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.104
She's brain dead.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.273
Her heart's
barely beating.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.912
He wants to see her before
we take him up to the OR.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.280
Should I bring him in?

13:00.313 --> 13:01.414
Yeah.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.917
I'll tell him.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.585
Thanks.

13:05.618 --> 13:10.423
All right, everybody,
see you tomorrow.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.868
( sighing )

13:39.586 --> 13:41.154
Hey, Jerry, can you
call housekeeping?

13:41.188 --> 13:43.023
Pizza kid with braces
puked again in Three.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.024
Sure.
Nacho?

13:44.057 --> 13:44.591
Oh, thanks.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.026
Cheesy.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.360
Jerry, where's
our alderman?

13:47.394 --> 13:49.429
Um, I think he's still
up in X-ray.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.531
Damn it. I asked them
to put a rush on it.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.000
Get them on the phone.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.002
Mmm, Kerry, we need
to discuss our alderman.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.469
Did you know
that he's the one

13:56.503 --> 13:59.339
who wrote the bill to finance
the spousal abuse shelter?

13:59.372 --> 14:00.640
He's one of the good guys.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.209
Mmm, not too good.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.577
When we were checking
for pelvic fractures

14:04.611 --> 14:06.914
I found a sore on his penis.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.481
I think it's syphilis.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.318
Did you swab it?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.086
Yeah, we're
waiting on labs.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.055
Dr. Weaver? Uh, they just
finished with the alderman.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.023
They're bringing him down now.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.424
Thanks, Jerry.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.426
How should I handle it
if it's positive?

14:19.459 --> 14:21.528
You won't have to.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.364
I will.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.367
( weakly ):
Her heart's
still beating?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.436
Her pupils are dilated.

14:29.469 --> 14:34.674
That means her brain
was deprived of oxygen
for too long.

14:34.707 --> 14:38.545
Maybe she'll wake up.

14:38.578 --> 14:42.282
No, she won't.

14:45.052 --> 14:49.489
Mr. Callahan...
your bleeding is getting worse.

14:49.522 --> 14:53.193
We have to take you up
to the O.R.

14:53.226 --> 14:57.064
We wanted a family.

14:57.097 --> 15:00.400
We couldn't.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.269
I couldn't.

15:02.302 --> 15:06.539
She didn't like talking
about donors or anything.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.208
She's gone.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.444
You're putting yourself
in danger.

15:11.478 --> 15:16.449
I can't just leave her
here to die alone.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.618
( knocking )

15:27.427 --> 15:30.197
Okay, cowboy, I got
a vascular surgeon,
an anesthesiologist

15:30.230 --> 15:31.664
and three surgical residents
waiting upstairs

15:31.698 --> 15:32.665
in an O.R. suite that rents
for five grand an hour.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.301
He wants to stay with his wife.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.536
Well, isn't that touching.
She's dying.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.272
Well, if she doesn't
die faster he's going
to be dying with her.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.640
I've explained all that.
I'm going upstairs.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.142
If he's not up there
in ten minutes

15:42.175 --> 15:44.044
I'm going to take out
your spleen.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.313
BRIGHT:
We're the richest country
in the world

15:46.346 --> 15:47.647
and we can't provide

15:47.680 --> 15:50.250
basic health services
for our citizens.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.352
Yeah, it's not just
emergency care.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.222
Prenatal screening,
drug and alcohol treatment.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.424
We do what we can
with limited resources.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.292
Everybody at City Hall
should come down here

15:59.326 --> 16:01.428
and see what the
hell kind of war
you fight every day.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.031
Well, you've been fighting
some pretty big wars yourself.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.399
Don't tell me we can't
find a private room
for the alderman.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.667
Nice to see you again, sir.
Robert Romano.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.369
Heard you were down here.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.438
Want to make sure you're getting
all the care you need.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.241
We're just waiting
on a few tests.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.575
I don't want
a private room.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.444
Lets me experience
the kind of service

16:17.477 --> 16:19.379
my constituents get
when they come in.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.581
Of course. And you're
in good hands with Dr. Weaver.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.383
But if you need anything-
anything at all--

16:23.416 --> 16:24.551
hope you'll give me a call.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.486
( sotto voce ):
Find him a room.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.222
I was on the committee
that hired that man.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.158
Well, he's an excellent
surgeon.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.592
Tragic about his arm.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.195
Lots of people downtown
wish it had been his head.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.429
( chuckles )

16:36.463 --> 16:38.098
Well, you haven't broken
your knee.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.400
But it looks like
you have some blood
in the joint.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.734
Is that serious?
No.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.570
But you'll feel better
once we drain it.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.538
That sounds unpleasant.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.708
( sighs ):
Sounds worse than it is.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.543
Could you give us a minute?

16:50.577 --> 16:51.544
Oh, sure.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.346
Espresso's calling.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.683
Girl lives on caffeine
and chocolate.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.618
Alderman...

16:58.651 --> 17:03.423
when Dr. Lewis examined
you, she found a sore.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.424
Yeah.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.358
Uh, is it what I think it is?

17:06.393 --> 17:08.661
We're still waiting
for the lab results.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.329
Well, you have some idea.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.598
It's probably syphilis.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.569
Wasn't the diagnosis
I was hoping for.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.607
How many partners
have you had in
the last year?

17:20.640 --> 17:21.808
Oh, only one.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.376
Okay.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.644
We'll just give you
a shot of antibiotics

17:24.676 --> 17:26.413
and you'll be fine.
Good.

17:26.445 --> 17:29.116
But we'll need to report it
to the Health Department.

17:29.116 --> 17:33.253
Any way we can keep it out
of my medical record?

17:33.286 --> 17:34.421
It's automatic.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.189
Once the labs are done, then...

17:36.223 --> 17:37.590
But there's no need to worry.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.526
Your records are confidential.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.594
No, your health records
are confidential.

17:41.628 --> 17:45.132
Every time there's an election,
they have to release mine.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.534
And syphilis is not a word
voters love to hear.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.270
I understand
your concerns.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.605
We'll both get treatment.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.542
You don't think everyone
deserves some privacy?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.810
JARVIK:
Her sats are still falling.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.379
Down to 83.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.715
Okay, call Lewis
and put on a mask.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.883
RACHEL:
Doug!

18:03.916 --> 18:05.618
Aah, hey, monkeys.

18:05.652 --> 18:08.288
( grunts ):
You making trouble?

18:08.321 --> 18:09.422
Nice to see you.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.623
Hey. I'm Dr. Pratt.

18:10.657 --> 18:11.891
You must be Doug.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.660
Yeah.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.296
Hey.
Hey.

18:16.329 --> 18:19.899
( laborious breathing )

18:19.932 --> 18:21.601
DOUG:
Hey.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.870
( breathlessly ):
What's he doing here?

18:23.903 --> 18:25.505
He's worried
about you.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.175
He doesn't worry about anyone
but himself.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.643
Aah, yeah, good to
see you, too, Mom.

18:30.677 --> 18:31.878
Did you find Lewis?

18:31.911 --> 18:33.280
She's coming.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.814
I told you not to call him.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.617
I don't want you
near my kids, Doug.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.452
Make him leave.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.487
( raspy breathing )

18:40.520 --> 18:41.521
LEWIS:
What's up?

18:41.554 --> 18:44.357
Her sats are down
to 83.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.658
Doug...

18:45.692 --> 18:47.527
Doug, you're high,
aren't you?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.496
No.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.331
Get the hell out of here!

18:51.364 --> 18:52.599
Who's he?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.201
Her son.
RACHEL:
Mom, please.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.502
Let Doug stay.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.404
So you can sit around
and watch him get stoned?

18:57.437 --> 18:58.638
Come on, they
live with you.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.341
Watch you sit around
and get drunk.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.343
Get the hell out of here!
Get out!

19:03.376 --> 19:04.711
( hacks )

19:04.744 --> 19:06.579
Get him...
LEWIS:
Take slow breaths.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.648
( raspy breathing )
( alarm sounding )

19:08.681 --> 19:10.617
RACHEL:
Oh, God.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.518
Mom?

19:11.551 --> 19:12.519
Sats down to 78.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.820
Crank up the O2.

19:13.853 --> 19:14.654
Get them out of here.

19:14.687 --> 19:15.922
Come on. Come on.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.557
She's not moving
any air.
Bag her.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.492
Get 20 etomidate,
100 of SUX.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.960
Set up for
an intubation.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.662
You called him?
Aunt's in Detroit.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.497
The brother's here.
I was just trying to help.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.932
You can help
by learning to listen

19:25.965 --> 19:28.235
when the patient asks you
not to do something.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.972
Jerry, Dr. Lewis
mislabeled a swab.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.908
Can we pull it
from the lab tray?

19:35.942 --> 19:38.345
Labs went out an hour ago.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.314
I need you to call
and cancel it.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.416
It's under Bright.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.585
The alderman?
Yeah.

19:45.618 --> 19:48.355
I can try.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.257
LEWIS:
She's oxygenating well.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.558
Turn her down to 80%

19:51.591 --> 19:53.826
and check a gas
in half-an-hour.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.894
I.C.U. is full.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.429
Call again,
she needs a bed.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.864
Hey, listen,
I'm sorry about that

19:57.897 --> 19:59.966
but I was just trying
to do the right thing.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.801
You exacerbated
a terrible situation.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.436
I told you
to call the aunt.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.637
I did.
She's 69 with MS.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.573
She can't take care
of those kids.

20:06.606 --> 20:09.909
Well, you think
stoner boy is going
to do any better?

20:09.942 --> 20:12.412
Doug?

20:12.445 --> 20:16.849
Hey, you guys, I've got to talk
to the doctors, all right?

20:20.820 --> 20:22.021
You okay?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.691
Uh, yeah,
I smoked a little

20:24.724 --> 20:29.929
this afternoon, you know,
but I-I'm fine now, so...

20:29.962 --> 20:31.764
Hey, did I kill her?

20:31.798 --> 20:33.266
No.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.568
We had to put a tube
in her throat

20:35.602 --> 20:36.836
to help her breathe.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.639
Why did she cough
up all that blood?

20:39.672 --> 20:43.276
She has an infection
in her lungs.

20:43.310 --> 20:47.447
Hey, look, I'm sorry
I said all that stuff.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.617
It's just... she just
gets to me.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.685
( exhales heavily )

20:52.719 --> 20:54.554
Your mom's in stable condition
right now

20:54.587 --> 20:56.523
but she's going
to have to be in I.C.U.

20:56.556 --> 20:57.724
for at least a week.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.960
Rachel and Marten
need a place to stay.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.630
Tonight, at least.

21:03.663 --> 21:07.600
Yeah, I guess.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.569
Well, it doesn't look
like your mom's aunt

21:09.602 --> 21:10.903
is going to be able
to help out.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.605
Oh, Aunt Sarah?

21:12.639 --> 21:15.608
She can't even feed herself.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.547
Is there anyone else
who can take care of those kids?

21:21.514 --> 21:23.783
No.

21:23.816 --> 21:27.420
There's nobody.

21:29.689 --> 21:32.091
Packed cells are in.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.660
Tom, listen to me.

21:33.693 --> 21:36.596
You have to go
to the O.R.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.466
( weakly ):
I won't leave her.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.700
( sighs )

21:40.733 --> 21:43.636
You could die, too,
if you don't.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.706
She's not dead.

21:53.946 --> 21:57.917
Malik, can you see
if the next two units are ready?

21:57.950 --> 22:00.520
MALIK:
Yeah.

22:00.553 --> 22:04.624
You remember when we went up
to Lake Louise

22:04.657 --> 22:06.393
biking that summer?

22:06.393 --> 22:07.960
( machine alarm sounding )

22:10.597 --> 22:12.865
Is that it?

22:12.899 --> 22:15.835
Yes.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.009
She's gone.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.612
( crying softly )

22:25.645 --> 22:30.550
Time of death 1934.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.658
Mr. Callahan...

22:38.691 --> 22:42.562
Thank you for letting me
be with her.

22:43.596 --> 22:46.666
Okay, let's move him.

22:50.503 --> 22:53.773
I'll call surgery and catch up
to you at the elevators, Malik.

22:53.806 --> 22:56.576
You got it.

23:05.618 --> 23:10.723
( machine beeps rhythmically )

23:18.898 --> 23:20.132
Labs came back
on your alderman.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.468
Positive
for syphilis.

23:21.468 --> 23:22.001
I asked Jerry to pull his swab.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.470
It was mislabled.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.505
When you want labs,
you can't get them.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.474
When you don't want
them, suddenly they
get all efficient.

23:27.474 --> 23:28.841
Chuny, do you know
where Lily is?

23:28.875 --> 23:30.643
I need a repeat potassium
on Mrs. Callahan.

23:30.677 --> 23:31.478
What is she
still doing here?

23:31.478 --> 23:32.912
She's an M.V.A.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.547
I know; Kovac
pronounced her
an hour ago.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.949
She's in and out of V-tach,
but she's got a pulse.

23:39.085 --> 23:42.121
Jerry, I thought I asked you
to pull the alderman's labs.

23:42.154 --> 23:44.023
I called them.
I'll call them again.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.224
No, it's all right.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.659
I'll take care
of it myself.

23:46.693 --> 23:47.927
Hey, paramedics
are pulling up with a kid.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.161
Took a fall.

23:49.195 --> 23:50.597
Don't they call
ahead anymore?

23:50.630 --> 23:51.964
Jerry, make sure
those TV news vans

23:51.998 --> 23:53.666
are out of the
ambulance bay.

23:53.700 --> 23:57.504
Hey, Luka, why is
Jessie Callahan
still in Trauma One?

23:57.537 --> 24:00.106
I-I'm curious
because she died an hour ago.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.575
Her husband wouldn't
go up to the O.R.
until she passed

24:02.609 --> 24:04.511
so I unhooked her leads
and pronounced her.

24:04.544 --> 24:06.112
Good God.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.047
What happens when
he gets back down
from surgery

24:08.080 --> 24:09.716
and finds out his
wife is still alive?

24:09.749 --> 24:11.150
I'll tell him
it was a miracle.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.719
Need a doctor over here.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.521
This isn't funny, Luka.

24:14.554 --> 24:18.525
You unhooked the monitors
of a critically injured woman.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.793
That's hardly in the best
interests of your patient.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.261
She wasn't my
patient, he was.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.597
David Scott, nine years old,
altered after a fall

24:24.631 --> 24:26.198
from the top bunk of a bunk bed.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.267
Neighbor was baby-sitting,
heard a crash and called 911.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.670
G.C.S. 235.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.575
The real one
will be bigger.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.577
I hope so.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.679
Oh, thank you.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.113
Have you tried these?

24:41.147 --> 24:43.550
They're like perfect
little salty things.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.151
Don't fill up on those.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.086
With any luck,
we might get out of here

24:47.119 --> 24:48.855
early enough
to get some real food.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.156
How much money
are they trying to raise?

24:50.189 --> 24:51.558
58, I think.

24:51.591 --> 24:52.992
I know we're
throwing in ten.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.226
Thousand?

24:54.260 --> 24:55.562
Million.

24:55.562 --> 24:57.764
Right.

24:57.797 --> 25:00.099
So, I guess that means
you get great seats forever?

25:00.132 --> 25:01.668
Gamma will.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.002
What do you do
with $58 million?

25:03.035 --> 25:04.804
You get architectural
significance.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.707
I mean, what's the point to
building a cultural edifice

25:07.740 --> 25:10.009
if you're not going to prove
your civic superiority?

25:10.042 --> 25:12.078
Well, that's a lot
of civic superiority.

25:12.111 --> 25:14.581
Hey, you know,
McNulty's clinic's
not too far from here.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.583
What do you think
he would do with
58 million bucks?

25:16.616 --> 25:18.818
Hot hors d'oeuvres
in his waiting room.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.319
Hello, John.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.021
Hello, Gamma.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.690
Hi, Steve.

25:23.723 --> 25:27.159
I'm Millicent Carter,
John's grandmother.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.596
Hi, uh, Abby Lockhart.

25:29.629 --> 25:30.997
Gamma, you've met Abby before.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.231
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:32.264 --> 25:35.602
So many people
in John's life.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.704
Don't you look
beautiful?

25:37.737 --> 25:39.606
What exactly are canapés?

25:41.040 --> 25:44.644
I mean, are they different
from... appetizers?

25:44.677 --> 25:47.914
I'm not sure, dear.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.616
There's a foundation
board meeting

25:49.649 --> 25:50.883
on Thursday, John.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.852
Can you come?
No, thank you.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.220
I'd appreciate it.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.689
We're electing
new officers.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.991
Oh, well... I always thought
that was a sort of

25:59.025 --> 26:01.661
"whoever's in the bathroom
gets elected president"

26:01.694 --> 26:02.629
kind of thing.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.363
I'm stepping down.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.999
I'd like you to take
your father's place
as treasurer.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.768
How did Dad
get off so easy?

26:08.801 --> 26:13.005
I've asked your father to
take my place as president.

26:13.039 --> 26:15.241
Don't you think
you're getting

26:15.274 --> 26:18.778
a bit long in the
tooth for the
disaffected youth

26:18.811 --> 26:20.346
role, John?

26:21.748 --> 26:24.016
Gamma, thank you,
but no, thank you.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.885
I already have a day job.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.291
Ow!

26:32.324 --> 26:33.125
David,
can you open your eyes?

26:33.159 --> 26:34.226
Ow!

26:34.260 --> 26:35.995
Looks like
a Colles' fracture.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.764
Excuse me, I'm trying to assess
his mental status.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.398
It's a response
to painful stimuli.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.200
David, do you know
where you are?

26:41.233 --> 26:42.401
( moaning )

26:42.434 --> 26:44.403
All right,
let's get a head C.T.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.672
Lots of old bruises.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.173
Active kid--
hockey, maybe?

26:47.206 --> 26:48.875
We should do a long bone survey.

26:48.908 --> 26:51.143
First we have to rule out
intercranial bleed.

26:51.177 --> 26:52.411
You guys seen Pratt?

26:52.444 --> 26:55.147
Mrs. Callahan's
potassium's 3.2.

26:55.181 --> 26:56.949
Okay, add 20 of K.C.L.

26:56.983 --> 26:57.750
to her next liter.

26:57.784 --> 26:58.985
She's a D.N.R.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.219
If she arrests,
we'll let her go.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.287
Until then, we treat her.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.354
She's dead, Kerry.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.356
( knock at door )

27:04.390 --> 27:06.225
Oh, great, just what I need.

27:06.258 --> 27:09.128
This is a decision
her husband should be making.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.162
He's in surgery.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.064
If you had told him the truth

27:12.098 --> 27:14.433
he could have given us clear
instructions on his wife's care.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.002
Now we
have to decide.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.770
Give her the "K."

27:20.439 --> 27:21.741
What can I do for you,
Robert?

27:21.774 --> 27:22.942
So, I'm finished
for the day

27:22.975 --> 27:24.310
and I come
downstairs to say

27:24.343 --> 27:26.045
good night and godspeed,
and lo and behold

27:26.078 --> 27:27.847
who should I find still
sitting on his ass

27:27.880 --> 27:29.215
in the middle
of the E.R.?

27:29.248 --> 27:30.883
We're still waiting
on a few tests for the...

27:30.917 --> 27:32.284
Alderman? Right,
that's right.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.285
Five hours later.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.322
Did I or did I not

27:36.355 --> 27:37.857
He didn't want a private room.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.291
You should have given
him one anyway.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.827
He should have had two
doctors and five nurses

27:40.860 --> 27:41.994
hovering over him
every minute.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.395
"Can I get you
anything, Alderman?

27:43.429 --> 27:45.732
A little more ice for
your knee, Alderman?"

27:45.732 --> 27:47.166
Yeah, we only have
five nurses...

27:47.199 --> 27:48.434
I don't give a damn.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.269
Whatever he needs,
whatever he wants

27:50.302 --> 27:51.804
you do it and you do it now.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.276
That was a little rude.

27:57.309 --> 27:58.911
Stay out of it.

27:58.945 --> 28:00.813
Excuse me, if I could have
your attention, please.

28:00.847 --> 28:01.480
So was that.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.082
With 200 fewer seats

28:03.115 --> 28:05.017
much larger rehearsal hall
and dressing rooms

28:05.051 --> 28:07.319
world-class...

28:07.353 --> 28:10.289
My grandmother doesn't
want me to be the treasurer
of the family foundation.

28:10.322 --> 28:11.157
She wants me
to quit working.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.992
She's old.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.494
She's probably looking for you
to take on some of her load.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.464
Embrace my familial
responsibilities.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.867
Join the family business.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.803
Which is... what, exactly?

28:23.836 --> 28:25.304
It's this.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.506
It's giving away money,
it's cutting ribbons

28:27.539 --> 28:29.108
it's waving to
the common man.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.210
It's Prince Charles
without the castle.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.378
I don't know about no castle.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.080
I've seen your family's house.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.848
Abby, I know that
you mean well

28:35.882 --> 28:37.149
but don't try to tell me

28:37.183 --> 28:38.818
what to do with
my life, please?

28:38.851 --> 28:41.420
It is a great pleasure
for me to introduce...

28:41.453 --> 28:42.421
Okay.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.323
John Carter.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.392
( applause )

28:55.835 --> 28:58.137
C.T.'s ready,
and he's waking up.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.205
Where's my dad?

28:59.238 --> 29:00.306
We called him.

29:00.339 --> 29:01.507
How did you
get hurt, David?

29:01.540 --> 29:03.175
I fell off the top bunk.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.812
Okay, we're going
to take care of you.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.446
This is Chuny, and
she's taking you up

29:07.479 --> 29:09.081
to get a few
more tests, okay?

29:09.115 --> 29:10.216
Will you find my dad?

29:10.249 --> 29:11.818
We've already
called him, honey.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.219
He should be here any minute.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.087
Dr. Kovac,
the kid's X rays are back.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.388
Finally.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.391
I thought Tuesday nights
were not busy, eh?

29:19.425 --> 29:20.426
Who told you that?

29:20.459 --> 29:23.062
Oh, damn it.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.063
What?

29:24.096 --> 29:25.564
Is D.C.F.S. still around?

29:25.597 --> 29:27.466
Excuse me, um, they told me
my son was back here.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.135
Uh, David Scott.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.337
An ambulance brought him in
just a few minutes ago.

29:31.370 --> 29:32.538
He fell out of his bed.

29:32.571 --> 29:33.505
Mr. Scott?

29:33.539 --> 29:34.841
Yeah.

29:34.841 --> 29:36.943
Where is he?
Is he okay?

29:36.976 --> 29:40.012
Your son has a broken wrist,
and he hit his head.

29:40.046 --> 29:41.380
( sighing )

29:41.413 --> 29:43.382
He gets hurt all the time.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.551
More since his mom left.

29:45.584 --> 29:48.554
His exam showed
some old injuries.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.356
Yeah, well, he
doesn't pay attention.

29:50.389 --> 29:52.524
The injuries are suspicious.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.527
What?

29:55.561 --> 29:57.496
Are you suggesting
that I hurt my own son?

29:57.529 --> 29:58.965
Do you?

29:58.998 --> 30:02.301
No. No, of course not.

30:04.570 --> 30:07.539
We're giving her
all the right antibiotics

30:07.573 --> 30:09.608
but her sepsis
is very advanced.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.478
So, her chances...?

30:12.511 --> 30:16.182
I'm afraid
they're not very good.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.417
I, I just need
to determine

30:18.450 --> 30:21.387
what is the best
living situation

30:21.420 --> 30:24.123
for your brother
and sister.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.324
Yeah.

30:25.357 --> 30:26.859
Do you think
living with you

30:26.893 --> 30:28.427
is the best
thing for them?

30:28.460 --> 30:30.496
Uh, probably not.

30:30.529 --> 30:33.099
So, I should find
someplace else
for them to stay?

30:33.132 --> 30:34.366
Wait a minute.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.268
You're not trying
to keep them together?

30:37.436 --> 30:39.271
Is this coming from you?

30:39.305 --> 30:42.174
I think Doug agrees
that foster care

30:42.208 --> 30:44.510
is the best option
for his brother and
sister right now.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.478
Doug, do you know
what foster care is like?

30:46.512 --> 30:49.448
Most likely they
won't even be able
to stay together.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.283
We do our best
to keep siblings together.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.651
But that doesn't always happen,
right?

30:52.684 --> 30:54.086
We do our best.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.455
Do you know what that means,
hmm?

30:56.488 --> 31:00.026
That means that
they're going
to get split up.

31:00.059 --> 31:03.662
Their mom's dying,
and they're going
to be separated.

31:03.695 --> 31:07.366
Living with strangers--
is that what you want?

31:09.268 --> 31:11.337
Hey, Doug, Doug.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.504
No, she's right!

31:12.538 --> 31:14.240
Listen, your mom might die.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.574
You need to stay together.

31:15.607 --> 31:16.608
They love you, man.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.144
( bitter laugh )

31:18.177 --> 31:19.545
Right. Right,
the dumb stoner

31:19.578 --> 31:21.113
who makes them laugh.

31:21.147 --> 31:22.949
You care about them;
that's all that matters.

31:22.982 --> 31:26.218
Hey, I can't take
care of two kids.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.520
You'd be surprised
at what you can do.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.590
No.

31:32.959 --> 31:34.493
Hey, trust me; I know.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.963
You just need to step up.

31:40.066 --> 31:43.369
Hey, you never should
have called me, all right?

31:43.402 --> 31:45.437
My mom's right.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.008
They're all right.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.979
Make them wrong.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.983
I can't, all right?

32:06.658 --> 32:07.693
Bright to Williams,
right?

32:07.726 --> 32:08.995
You have the new label?

32:09.028 --> 32:10.629
Specimen tube
was mislabeled.

32:10.662 --> 32:13.432
Happens. We don't want
the paperwork gods
to strike us dead.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.367
We just need

32:15.401 --> 32:17.403
a Dr. Hancock.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.611
That's it?
That's it.

32:27.246 --> 32:28.747
I think Shaw's is open late

32:28.780 --> 32:31.483
if you still want to
get something to eat.

32:31.517 --> 32:32.684
No, I'm not hungry.

32:32.718 --> 32:36.022
Not hungry or pissed at me?

32:37.289 --> 32:38.590
Look, I'm sorry

32:38.624 --> 32:40.526
but I don't think
you have any right

32:40.559 --> 32:42.228
to lecture me
about my family.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.599
Was that an apology?

32:47.633 --> 32:50.602
I don't owe you an apology.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.574
Look, you want me to
end up like my father--

32:55.607 --> 32:57.676
at Gamma's beck and
call handing out checks

32:57.709 --> 33:00.212
so that the Art Institute
can have another De Kooning

33:00.246 --> 33:01.713
or the symphony
can have travertine

33:01.747 --> 33:03.582
instead of tile
in its bathrooms?

33:03.615 --> 33:05.051
Get involved
with the foundation

33:05.084 --> 33:06.552
and change
the priorities.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.787
Give the money to health care,
education, needle exchange--

33:08.820 --> 33:11.057
I don't know, anything
you feel passionate about.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.092
I feel passionate about
what I'm doing, okay?

33:13.125 --> 33:14.660
I feel passionate
about working at County.

33:14.693 --> 33:15.794
Who says
you can't do both?

33:15.827 --> 33:17.496
( rueful chuckle ):
I do.

33:17.529 --> 33:19.598
Okay, look, you were born
really, really rich.

33:19.631 --> 33:20.799
So what?

33:20.832 --> 33:22.734
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.636
I'm not ashamed
of who I am.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.372
No? You drive a Jeep.

33:26.405 --> 33:27.606
You wear a cheap watch.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.341
You rent
a two-bedroom apartment.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.677
What do you want me
to do, drive a BMW?

33:31.710 --> 33:33.379
No. I don't care.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.614
I couldn't care less,
but you care a lot.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.416
You want everybody
to think

33:37.449 --> 33:39.785
that you're just like them,
and you're not.

33:39.818 --> 33:43.122
You just... signed a check
for $10 million in there.

33:43.155 --> 33:44.556
You didn't even blink.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.692
I write a check for over $100,
I get a stomach ache.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.494
I give something more
important than money.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.229
I give my time, and
I do it every day

33:50.262 --> 33:52.098
to real people, and
it makes a difference.

33:52.131 --> 33:53.532
And I think that's great.

33:53.565 --> 33:54.800
I really, really do.

33:54.833 --> 33:57.169
But money
makes a difference, too.

33:57.203 --> 33:59.305
You know
where my money comes from?

33:59.338 --> 34:00.739
Do you know where the money

34:00.772 --> 34:03.375
for the Carter Symphony Hall
comes from?

34:03.409 --> 34:05.511
My great-
grandfather

34:05.544 --> 34:07.313
made a killing
during the Depression

34:07.346 --> 34:08.746
cornering the coal market.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.783
In the winter of 1933,
a lot of children froze to death

34:11.817 --> 34:14.520
and my family made
out like bandits.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.755
That was 70 years ago, Carter.

34:16.788 --> 34:19.558
You can't give
the money back now.

34:19.591 --> 34:23.129
Why not help give it to people
who really need it?

34:23.161 --> 34:24.463
There are still lots of kids

34:24.496 --> 34:26.465
freezing to death
every winter, Carter.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.839
How's the knee?

34:33.871 --> 34:35.241
Sore.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.708
Well, the
swelling's down.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.645
Looks like we can
get you started home.

34:39.678 --> 34:40.579
Ah, almost 11:00?

34:40.612 --> 34:41.813
Should be safe.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.550
Local news usually packs up
and goes home

34:44.583 --> 34:45.817
if they miss the 10:00.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.553
I'll go get the car.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.589
All right, your thigh will
probably be a little sore

34:50.621 --> 34:52.257
from the penicillin shot.

34:52.291 --> 34:56.695
How do we stand
on the medical records issue?

34:56.728 --> 34:59.598
It's been handled.

34:59.631 --> 35:02.668
Good, good.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.803
Thank you for your discretion.

35:04.836 --> 35:08.574
I'm glad I could help.

35:08.607 --> 35:09.708
Bright is discharged, Jerry.

35:09.741 --> 35:10.742
The alderman?

35:10.776 --> 35:12.211
Did we ever get his labs back?

35:12.244 --> 35:13.179
They were negative.

35:13.212 --> 35:14.413
You're kidding.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.215
That lesion
was right out of Netter's.

35:16.248 --> 35:17.483
We should run it again.

35:17.516 --> 35:18.650
It's fine.

35:18.684 --> 35:20.452
He could have
untreated syphilis.

35:20.486 --> 35:21.653
He's fine; let it go.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.389
MAN:
Don't touch me!

35:23.422 --> 35:24.556
Yeah, almost midnight.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.258
Let the shouting begin.

35:26.292 --> 35:29.528
He's scared.
He needs me with him.

35:29.561 --> 35:30.662
This is you, right?

35:30.696 --> 35:31.530
You better
calm down.

35:31.563 --> 35:32.698
No, I'm okay.

35:32.731 --> 35:33.799
But this is crazy.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.667
I have never hurt my son.

35:38.937 --> 35:40.706
What the hell
was that about?

35:40.739 --> 35:42.341
A father
abusing his son.

35:42.374 --> 35:43.709
Where's Social
Services?

35:43.742 --> 35:44.810
They were busy.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.512
So, you called
the police?

35:46.545 --> 35:48.447
The kid has multiple
old fractures.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.216
Did you even talk
to the child?

35:50.249 --> 35:51.883
Of course I did;
he was scared.

35:58.390 --> 36:01.660
Hey, you got the blue cast.

36:01.693 --> 36:04.296
That's my favorite.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.598
Is my dad coming back?

36:06.632 --> 36:10.302
Well, he had to talk
to some people.

36:10.336 --> 36:12.571
You get along pretty well
with your dad?

36:12.604 --> 36:14.373
Better since Mom left.

36:14.406 --> 36:17.509
He says we're like
Starsky and Hutch.

36:17.543 --> 36:21.247
That's an old TV show
we watch on Nick at Nite.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.614
That sounds nice.

36:22.648 --> 36:24.650
Yeah.

36:24.683 --> 36:28.320
You've been hurt a lot
in the last few months.

36:28.354 --> 36:32.258
I don't pay enough attention.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.629
Did you really
fall out of bed today, David?

36:43.302 --> 36:46.672
I...

36:46.705 --> 36:48.540
I jumped.

36:48.574 --> 36:51.977
Is that the truth, David?

36:52.010 --> 36:53.945
It's okay.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.581
You can tell me.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.641
Hello?

37:22.674 --> 37:25.477
MAN:
We're closed.

37:25.511 --> 37:26.778
Dr. McNulty?

37:26.812 --> 37:29.748
If you're sick,
go to County.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.921
Dr. McNulty,
we met the other day.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.489
I'm Dr. Carter.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.691
You left before your
tests came back.

37:39.725 --> 37:40.959
Your blood sugar was 435.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.429
Your diabetes is
way out of control.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.664
I take my Orinase.

37:45.697 --> 37:48.467
Orinase? They
still make that?

37:48.500 --> 37:50.035
It works fine for me.

37:50.068 --> 37:52.538
Not according
to your tests.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.840
There are newer,
better drugs.

37:54.873 --> 37:58.544
Yeah. Thanks.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.746
Good-bye.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.614
Listen, you're not going
to be able

38:02.648 --> 38:05.451
to help anybody down here
if you're in a coma or dead.

38:07.853 --> 38:10.456
Actos, six-month supply.

38:10.489 --> 38:11.657
Hey, hey, hey.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.492
You steal those
from County?

38:13.525 --> 38:14.960
There are laws
against that.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.495
( sighing )

38:16.528 --> 38:17.829
You got to watch your sugar,
too.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.366
Sure.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.968
Don't get your tux dirty
on the way out.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.641
Looks like you could use

38:29.675 --> 38:31.577
some new equipment
around here.

38:31.610 --> 38:32.678
Nah, nah-nah-nah.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.045
You're not doing that.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.782
You could get yourself
a cardiac monitor.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.650
Chemistry analyzer.

38:38.684 --> 38:41.620
12-lead.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.722
Anything else you might need.

38:43.755 --> 38:46.592
What's this,
white liberal guilt?

38:46.625 --> 38:49.094
Probably.

38:49.127 --> 38:51.630
Lots of guilt.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.065
No, thanks.

38:54.099 --> 38:57.569
I'm not here
to make you feel better.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.773
There must be something
I can do.

39:01.807 --> 39:05.411
Yeah. You can sweep.

39:09.915 --> 39:12.651
Hey, Malik, did I.C.U.
come for my pneumonia yet?

39:12.684 --> 39:14.720
Yeah, she went up
a couple of minutes ago.

39:14.753 --> 39:17.423
D.C.F.S. is taking the kids up
to say good-bye.

39:17.456 --> 39:18.624
She's still alive, right?

39:18.657 --> 39:21.593
Yeah. You came back.

39:21.627 --> 39:23.595
I never really left.

39:23.629 --> 39:25.096
You know, she said

39:25.130 --> 39:28.867
I was the biggest mistake
of her life.

39:30.736 --> 39:31.670
I don't want

39:31.703 --> 39:33.705
to let them down...

39:33.739 --> 39:35.974
you know, but I don't know
if I can do it.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.176
You just do
the best that you can.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.978
That will be enough.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.815
Come on.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.585
I'll take you
up to see them.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.660
Go ahead.

39:54.693 --> 39:56.628
Thanks.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.667
He came back, huh?

40:01.700 --> 40:04.670
Yeah.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.872
Hey, uh, I was
out of line before.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.575
Whatever. I'm an adult,
I can handle it.

40:09.608 --> 40:12.578
You should worry
about those two kids.

40:12.611 --> 40:13.979
Hey, Pratt,
phone call.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.681
( sighing )

40:15.714 --> 40:17.583
Hello, Dr. Pratt.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.951
Hey, Mrs. Knightly.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.853
What...?

40:21.887 --> 40:24.756
Oh, man; when?

40:24.790 --> 40:26.224
Okay.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.094
Jerry, I'm
off in 15.

40:29.127 --> 40:32.531
I'll come in early and
make it up in the morning.

40:32.564 --> 40:34.199
Was that Pratt
leaving again?

40:34.232 --> 40:36.034
Uh, yeah,
he had to go early.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.102
Go where?

40:37.135 --> 40:38.570
Didn't say.

40:38.604 --> 40:40.806
Well, guess what?
I want to go, too.

40:40.839 --> 40:42.574
Maybe I should just leave.

40:42.608 --> 40:43.742
What do you think?

40:43.775 --> 40:45.611
Just leave because
I feel like it.

40:45.644 --> 40:47.613
Your child abuser
was the case of a boy

40:47.646 --> 40:49.881
wanting to spend more
time with his father.

40:49.915 --> 40:51.617
Who, the Scott kid?

40:51.650 --> 40:52.884
Yes, the kid
hurts himself

40:52.918 --> 40:54.252
so Dad will stay
home from work

40:54.285 --> 40:55.854
and watch TV with him.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.123
Luka, did you page me
for a post-op seroma?

40:58.156 --> 40:59.658
Yeah, in Exam Four.

40:59.691 --> 41:01.793
Your Mr. Callahan's
finally in recovery.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.662
Send your patients
up to the O.R.

41:03.695 --> 41:06.565
a little bit more promptly
in future, all right?

41:06.598 --> 41:08.567
Next time,
get D.C.F.S. down here

41:08.600 --> 41:10.001
before you call
the cops.

41:33.191 --> 41:36.628
Tom's out of surgery.

41:36.662 --> 41:40.566
He's going to be okay.

41:40.566 --> 41:43.001
You can let go now.

41:46.772 --> 41:48.840
Pratt left again.

41:48.874 --> 41:51.677
Man, when I was an intern,
it was a full-time job.

41:51.710 --> 41:52.911
Yeah, it still is.

41:52.944 --> 41:54.813
( groaning ):
I just want to go home

41:54.846 --> 41:55.947
and get into bed.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.616
What do you think
the odds are

41:57.649 --> 41:59.918
that Antonio Banderas
will be there waiting for me?

41:59.951 --> 42:01.052
Oh, I almost forgot.

42:01.086 --> 42:02.654
Here. I know
it's a little early

42:02.688 --> 42:05.023
but I was in Fields
buying a gift for my niece

42:05.056 --> 42:06.692
and I saw the infant stuff.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.594
I pass those little clothes

42:08.594 --> 42:09.895
and I just go
into a trance state.

42:09.928 --> 42:11.029
I have
to buy something.

42:11.062 --> 42:12.230
Susan...

42:12.263 --> 42:13.732
Those little onesies
and jumpers--

42:13.765 --> 42:15.100
they have
complete control over me.

42:15.133 --> 42:16.602
And the little shoes.

42:16.602 --> 42:17.836
I didn't know
if it was a boy or a girl

42:17.869 --> 42:19.605
so, I got it in green,
like a neutral color

42:19.638 --> 42:21.640
but if you hate it,
I have the gift receipt.

42:21.673 --> 42:23.274
I'm not pregnant anymore.

42:25.711 --> 42:27.779
I miscarried.

42:27.813 --> 42:30.949
Oh, uh, God.

42:30.982 --> 42:34.119
Kerry, I'm so sorry.

42:36.955 --> 42:40.191
The embryonic loss rate
after implantation

42:40.225 --> 42:41.660
is about 30% in I.V.F.

42:41.693 --> 42:42.794
It isn't rare.

42:44.730 --> 42:46.732
Thank you for
the thought.

42:46.765 --> 42:47.899
Sure.

42:47.933 --> 42:49.635
And when you see Pratt

42:49.668 --> 42:53.338
why don't you remind him
this is a full-time job?

42:53.371 --> 42:54.806
Good night.

42:54.840 --> 42:56.074
They brought him in

42:56.107 --> 42:57.943
on a 10-29--
possible stolen car.

42:57.976 --> 43:01.112
The car was clean,
but they found a shotgun
with a clipped barrel.

43:01.146 --> 43:02.848
And the other boys
have criminal paper

43:02.881 --> 43:04.349
but your brother's
clear.

43:04.382 --> 43:06.718
He was hanging next
to the wrong car
at the wrong time.

43:06.752 --> 43:09.087
This is against,
like, 15 regs,
so make it fast.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.656
Thanks.

43:10.656 --> 43:11.757
Hey, if I ever
get shot

43:11.790 --> 43:13.224
I want to end
up at County.

43:13.258 --> 43:14.926
You guys always
take care of us.

43:14.960 --> 43:15.961
Thank you.

43:15.994 --> 43:17.062
Don't be mad.

43:17.095 --> 43:18.296
Don't be mad, G, please.

43:18.329 --> 43:19.164
It wasn't my fault.

43:19.197 --> 43:20.298
It was Dukey's car.

43:20.331 --> 43:22.000
He's the one
that had the gun.

43:22.033 --> 43:23.935
What were you
doing with Dukey
and those boys?

43:23.969 --> 43:25.671
Didn't I tell you?

43:25.671 --> 43:27.673
I was just telling
them about the job
you had got for me

43:27.673 --> 43:30.141
and when I was telling them,
that's when the cops they came.

43:30.175 --> 43:31.342
Okay, okay, listen to me.

43:31.376 --> 43:32.844
Do not talk to
anybody in here--

43:32.878 --> 43:33.912
not the police, no one.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.280
Not until I get you a lawyer.

43:35.313 --> 43:38.149
Tell Mr. Keegan
I won't be late next time.

43:38.183 --> 43:39.284
Yeah.

43:39.317 --> 43:40.686
Was he mad?

43:40.719 --> 43:41.853
Tell him I promise.

43:41.887 --> 43:43.755
Leon, you didn't show up.

43:43.789 --> 43:45.156
You probably lost that job.

43:46.958 --> 43:50.028
( sobbing ):
No, G. No.

43:50.061 --> 43:52.430
I-I, I don't want

43:52.463 --> 43:53.732
to stay in here, G.

43:53.765 --> 43:54.700
Come on, please?

43:54.733 --> 43:56.101
Can we just go home?

43:56.134 --> 43:58.136
Listen, the judge
sets bail in the morning.

43:58.169 --> 43:59.404
Then I can take you home.

43:59.437 --> 44:01.172
In the morning?!
Doc, you got to go.

44:01.206 --> 44:03.408
( sobbing ):
G, I can't spend
the night here!

44:03.441 --> 44:05.143
I don't even know these people.

44:05.176 --> 44:07.078
First thing in
the morning, okay?

44:07.112 --> 44:08.814
Doc...
( sobbing )

44:08.847 --> 44:11.182
First thing.
G, don't leave me!

44:11.216 --> 44:14.853
G, don't do that, G!

44:14.886 --> 44:18.456
G, come on! G! G!!!

44:18.489 --> 44:20.225
Don't leave me here!

44:20.258 --> 44:22.260
Come on! G! G!
