Yes, you can.

I was in the woods,
and it all became clear to me.

Wait. That means...

that I performed
all those surgeries...

08:39.383 --> 08:40.315
by myself.

08:40.350 --> 08:42.017
CHIEF:
Exactly.

08:42.051 --> 08:43.952
Those skills were always in you.

08:43.986 --> 08:46.722
You just need to learn to do it
without the mouse.

You are still very much
our best surgeon.

09:02.606 --> 09:05.274
GLENN: Well, this time,
I had a little help.

09:13.283 --> 09:16.251
Not from my dead mouse...

09:16.286 --> 09:19.154
but from a very live
human being.

09:19.188 --> 09:21.990
Blake, I'm proud to call you
my friend.

enjoyed this day

09:24.630 --> 09:26.321
that you and I
have had together, Cat.

just a tiny bit now.

an apology.

Yeah.

OWEN: And I totally understand
how it was necessary

09:36.873 --> 09:39.809
for you guys to go to the lengths
you did to show that to me.

09:39.843 --> 09:43.043
Anything less than a totally
immersive human body experience,

09:43.078 --> 09:44.680
I probably wouldn't have gotten
the message.

these things since 2010,
