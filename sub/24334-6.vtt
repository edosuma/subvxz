00:28.196 --> 00:30.164
WOMAN:
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

00:30.198 --> 00:32.600
That's... I have... I have it,
I have it, I have it...

00:41.742 --> 00:43.744
*

02:14.668 --> 02:16.670
Okay.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.075
It's okay.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.279
You're okay.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.315
Hmm?

02:54.475 --> 02:56.477
*

03:18.799 --> 03:20.768
Spit now.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.856
*

04:10.784 --> 04:12.786
Sleep tight.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.779
Now Stop.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.615
Now, let me, let me... Now?

04:52.926 --> 04:55.062
I got to... Stop.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.813
Morning, Cynthia.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.284
MAN:
Man.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.319
Boy shorts or a red thong.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.759
I'd like to just...

05:27.194 --> 05:28.629
CYNTHIA:
Go ahead. They're waiting.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.830
It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

05:29.863 --> 05:30.998
CYNTHIA:
They're waiting.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.333
DON:
What's left to say?

05:33.367 --> 05:36.837
We're an open book, basically.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.939
You've seen
all the financials...

05:38.972 --> 05:41.442
-Come on, already,
we're waiting.
-...toured the facilities.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.677
Are we gonna do this or what?

05:43.711 --> 05:46.346
A merger of this size,
you understand,

05:46.380 --> 05:47.781
with government oversight--

05:47.815 --> 05:51.184
our shareholders
are a bit skittish,

05:51.218 --> 05:53.220
to put it mildly,
and they just want to make sure

05:53.253 --> 05:54.422
that everything is perfect.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.256
No stone unturned, as they say.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.358
DON:
Do it, bitch.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.127
Take the bait.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.495
MAN 1:
Sign it.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.063
Pending lawsuits.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.465
Class action.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.799
Bankruptcy.

06:05.833 --> 06:06.900
Sign it.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.235
MAN 2:
Cruller.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.203
Maybe a bear claw.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.939
MAN 1:
Sign it. Faulty relays.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.140
Fire hazard.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.708
Pending lawsuits.

06:14.742 --> 06:17.210
And I have to say,
I want to thank you,

06:17.244 --> 06:20.347
for the patience that you have
shown throughout this process,

06:20.380 --> 06:21.982
and I'm pleased to report

06:22.015 --> 06:24.485
that everything has been vetted

06:24.518 --> 06:26.654
to our satisfaction.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.988
Wait.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.495
Can I talk to you for a minute?

06:36.530 --> 06:37.931
Who are you?

06:39.533 --> 06:40.968
Who is he?

06:41.001 --> 06:43.003
It's, uh, nobody.

06:43.036 --> 06:46.840
He's the ex-coffee boy.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.144
They're not telling you
everything.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.947
What is this, a shakedown?

06:53.981 --> 06:57.284
Just sign the deal.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.688
It's been ten months.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.591
The champagne's on ice.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.569
-Talk.
-There's...

07:15.603 --> 07:17.571
You missed something.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.673
-Not possible.
-DAVID: A lawsuit.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.041
Class action. Not filed yet.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.242
Faulty relays.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.011
Some kind of fire hazard.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.213
They kept it quiet.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.815
How do you know that?

07:29.883 --> 07:34.121
I'm... I'm psychic.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.923
LAURA:
Stupid or crazy?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.257
I'm not crazy.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.425
It's... I can't help it.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.594
I hear people's thoughts.

07:40.628 --> 07:42.195
Like... right now,

07:42.229 --> 07:43.897
you're thinking about
how your ankle hurts,

07:43.931 --> 07:45.899
'cause you tweaked it
on the treadmill yesterday,

07:45.933 --> 07:48.902
and in there, you were
thinking about your son,

07:48.936 --> 07:50.237
and how he may be
smoking weed and stealing

07:50.270 --> 07:51.905
from your wallet at night.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.241
Just ask them.

07:54.274 --> 07:57.611
Faulty relays, see what happens.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.489
I'm sorry.
I think his mom

08:09.523 --> 08:11.224
dropped him on his head
too many times.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.962
Kids today.
I had a girl one time,

08:14.995 --> 08:17.097
started crying in a meeting,
wouldn't stop.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.932
We had to call the boys
with the butterfly nets.

08:20.367 --> 08:23.003
You know, I-I'm curious, though,

08:23.036 --> 08:25.773
when were you gonna tell me
about the faulty relays?

08:25.806 --> 08:27.174
What?

08:27.207 --> 08:29.009
LAURA:
How many fires have there been,

08:29.042 --> 08:31.845
exactly?

08:33.581 --> 08:35.616
That's...

08:37.350 --> 08:39.653
-I'm...
-MAN 2: 302.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.221
DON:
...beside myself with...

08:41.254 --> 08:43.490
not knowing the topic
of conversation.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.325
"Relays," is that a race?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.996
302.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.731
That's impressive for a product

08:50.764 --> 08:53.333
that's been on the market
only six weeks.

08:53.366 --> 08:57.004
And with 11 million units in
the field, let's say you settle

08:57.037 --> 08:59.006
for 50K per person,
plus legal fees...

08:59.039 --> 09:00.140
DON:
Look,

09:00.173 --> 09:01.274
that's...

09:01.308 --> 09:02.342
Okay, these fires...

09:02.375 --> 09:03.877
It's...

09:03.911 --> 09:06.714
They might not even file.
And even if they do,

09:06.747 --> 09:09.216
they got to prove
we knew those relays were...

09:09.249 --> 09:12.352
which...
good luck with that.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.388
Yes, good luck with that.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.591
We're done here.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.898
LAURA:

09:54.862 --> 09:58.799

no rich no more... *

10:04.772 --> 10:06.573
Hey, move along.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.277

the world *

10:11.912 --> 10:13.947

10:13.981 --> 10:16.984
* What to do *

10:21.488 --> 10:25.158

10:25.192 --> 10:27.928

10:33.801 --> 10:35.836
-No, no. No more.

11:06.967 --> 11:11.571
* I'd love to change the world *

11:13.807 --> 11:17.911
* But I don't know what to do *

11:22.382 --> 11:27.387
* So I'll leave it up to you *

11:30.924 --> 11:34.261
* So I'll leave it up to you *

11:37.931 --> 11:39.900

11:39.933 --> 11:43.737

11:54.247 --> 11:56.216
* There's no solution... *

11:56.249 --> 11:57.851
Hello?

11:57.885 --> 11:59.486
AMY:
Hey, it's me.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.221
How's work going?

12:01.254 --> 12:03.223
Good.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.592
I'm stacking boxes.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.360
Fun.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.764
Consider this your friendly
little alarm clock reminding you

12:10.798 --> 12:14.101
it's time to take
your afternoon pill.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.236
* Them and us *

12:16.269 --> 12:19.807
* Stop the war... *

12:21.308 --> 12:23.343
David?

12:25.645 --> 12:27.247
David?

12:27.280 --> 12:29.582
Yeah.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.952
Do it now,

12:31.985 --> 12:35.155
w

12:35.188 --> 12:37.590
* Do *

12:40.861 --> 12:44.798

up to you... *

12:49.870 --> 12:53.807
* So I'll leave it up to you. *

12:55.242 --> 12:58.211
Only take one.

12:58.245 --> 13:00.447
Remember what happened
last time?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.423
It's bitter.

13:10.457 --> 13:14.261
Swallow it with water, silly.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.728
MAN:
Not paying you to talk

13:15.762 --> 13:17.264
on the phone.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.432
I got to go.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.568
Okay, uh...

13:21.601 --> 13:24.304
Well, it's 3:00 now.
I'll meet you out front at 8:00.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.839
Have a great day.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.924
DAVID:
You know, it's...
you know, there's...

13:43.957 --> 13:45.492
different possibilities.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.160
You know, there's
different configurations.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.561
Multiple realities.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.297
Different realities.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.932
I'm saying.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.401
It's this thing,
th-the multiple worlds theory,

13:54.434 --> 13:57.437
from, like,
quantum mechanics, right?

13:57.470 --> 13:59.339
And...

13:59.372 --> 14:01.808
And-and-and, um...

14:01.841 --> 14:03.944
-Uh...

14:03.977 --> 14:05.545
Every event,

14:05.578 --> 14:08.015
the things we do, there's, like,
a million possible outcomes.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.816
Choices! Choices.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.319
And the theory is

14:12.352 --> 14:15.488
that each outcome
actually happens. Hmm?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.191
Like a tree growing branches,

14:18.225 --> 14:20.928
and-and each branch is, like,
an alternate timeline.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.829
DAVID:
So right now, you're in class,

14:22.862 --> 14:25.365
listening to me drone on and on
about

14:25.398 --> 14:27.534
But in another timeline,

14:27.567 --> 14:29.202
y-you skipped school.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.703
Y-You've gone
to watch Point Break.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.043
Or you're in the hospital
with leukemia.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.547
And, I mean,
this reality, right,

14:40.580 --> 14:42.115
w-we're sitting here,
eating whatever,

14:42.149 --> 14:44.551
bullshit cold fries, right?

14:45.718 --> 14:47.654
But i-in another timeline,

14:47.687 --> 14:49.256
I'm, like...
I'm, like, a billionaire.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.159
I'm a billionaire.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.360
Or-or homeless.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.862
Or-or married

14:55.895 --> 14:57.530
in the suburbs with,
like, 2.3 kids.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.566
*

15:18.551 --> 15:20.820
And every time
each me makes a decision,

15:20.853 --> 15:22.822
or something happens
where the future could, like,

15:22.855 --> 15:24.691
go in different directions,

15:24.724 --> 15:26.393
another branch springs up.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.995
And that branch makes branches,

15:28.028 --> 15:29.896
and that branch
makes branches,

15:29.929 --> 15:31.731
and that branch makes branches,

15:31.764 --> 15:33.500
and that branch
makes branches.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.768
Mm.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.513
DAVID:
Oh.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.316
-BOY: Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

15:49.349 --> 15:50.550
GIRL:
We want waffles.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.618
-BOY: Waffles!
-Waffles!

15:51.651 --> 15:53.953
:
Waffles!

15:56.256 --> 15:57.457
And that branch makes branches.

15:57.490 --> 15:58.691
See what I'm saying?

16:00.760 --> 16:02.729
It's a lot of branches.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.879
AMY :
David.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.986
No, that's...

16:27.020 --> 16:28.988
Good job.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.891
Good job?

16:31.924 --> 16:33.593
No, I'm... That-that's great.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.794
I'm-I'm...

16:34.827 --> 16:36.796
I'm happy for you.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.731
You're sweet, but...

16:40.133 --> 16:43.303
I mean,
I don't know for sure.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.605
Henry.

16:45.638 --> 16:46.873
But who knows?

16:46.906 --> 16:49.742
Maybe, you and Philly?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.182
You know, she's nice, though.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.283
You know?

16:56.316 --> 17:00.320
I think she-she gets you.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.863
No, that-that's... no.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.499
That's dumb.
I'm... That's not gonna...

17:12.532 --> 17:15.735
Well, why can't you have a...

17:15.768 --> 17:19.239
what everyone else has?

17:19.272 --> 17:23.876
A-A nice home, a family...

17:23.910 --> 17:26.879
Because I'm sick.

* How the strong get weak *

18:40.287 --> 18:42.088
* And the rich get poor *

18:42.121 --> 18:44.724
* Slave to love *

18:44.757 --> 18:47.294
* Oh *

18:47.327 --> 18:50.463
* Slave to love... *

18:54.133 --> 18:55.368
That should be sufficient...

18:55.402 --> 18:56.569
No!

18:56.603 --> 18:58.205
I did not! No!

20:14.281 --> 20:16.316
Oh.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.924
DROOG 1:
Oh, look at him there,
my lovelies,

20:57.957 --> 21:00.893
sleeping the sleep
of forgotten men.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.195
Ooh!

21:03.229 --> 21:05.231
Wakey, wakey, grandpa.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.273
Did he send you?

21:15.508 --> 21:17.043
Is he here?

21:17.076 --> 21:18.277
DROOG 2:
Nobody sent us.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.779
DROOG 1:
Except the Lord.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.448
-The Lord above.
-Mm-hmm.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.650
Who says he can't stand
the smell anymore.

21:23.683 --> 21:26.218
Piss off, then.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.054
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

21:30.457 --> 21:32.525
Or just finish me off.

21:32.559 --> 21:35.127
I have no use
for this world anymore.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.764
Men on the moon.

21:37.797 --> 21:41.067
And men spinning
around the Earth.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.769
And there's no attention paid

21:42.802 --> 21:45.772
to earthly law and order
no more.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.774
Come on, let's get him.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.708
*

22:49.001 --> 22:51.904
Oh, long day.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.940
Mama needs a cocktail.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.716
Hmm. How was work?

23:03.750 --> 23:05.652
Boxes.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.353
Milk.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.221
Boxes.

23:09.255 --> 23:11.190
Milk.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.059
It's a job.

23:15.261 --> 23:17.997
What are you listening to, hmm?

23:22.234 --> 23:25.237
Nice.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.576
Are you hungry?

23:29.609 --> 23:32.411
I got a potpie at the market.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.384
Can't take your pill
on an empty stomach.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.920
No more pills.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.555
I'm better now.

23:42.589 --> 23:43.756
No more pills.

23:44.791 --> 23:48.227
Sweetie...

23:48.260 --> 23:50.429
you're wearing two bathrobes

23:50.463 --> 23:52.431
and you're listening
to jungle sounds.

23:52.465 --> 23:56.402
I can't think when I take them.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.038
I know.

23:59.071 --> 24:02.942
But you don't want to go back
to the hospital, right?

24:02.975 --> 24:05.444
You don't want to hurt anyone.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.949
Me.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.422
No.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.859
So, we will have potpie

24:19.892 --> 24:21.427
and a pill.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.964
I got cookies and cream
for dessert.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.800
I'm not six.

24:27.834 --> 24:31.604
So... you don't want ice cream?

24:33.640 --> 24:35.775
I didn't say that.

24:54.126 --> 24:57.096
And this includes
the China holdings?

24:57.129 --> 24:59.298
Yes, sir.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.201
As soon as you sign, you'll be
the richest man in the world.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.918
You're thinking,
"How is this possible?

25:18.951 --> 25:20.987
"He was the coffee boy.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.455
He worked for me."

25:23.489 --> 25:24.891
Sir, I wasn't...

25:24.924 --> 25:27.727
I can read your mind, Laura.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.498
Yes, sir.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.567
Sorry, sir.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.107
God blessed me with a gift,

25:41.140 --> 25:43.843
do you understand?

25:43.876 --> 25:47.780
I am his chosen vessel.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.853
In the ancient days,

25:53.886 --> 25:57.023
mankind built a tower so high

25:57.056 --> 26:00.827
that it threatened
to touch Heaven,

26:00.860 --> 26:04.363
and God cursed us
with foreign language.

26:04.396 --> 26:07.734
Misunderstanding and
the inability to communicate.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.270
But I know what's in the heart

26:11.303 --> 26:14.874
of every man, woman
and child on this Earth.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.409
Gone is the confusion,

26:17.443 --> 26:20.546
the division.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.549
I am the great uniter.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.584
You're a saint, sir.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.191
The money is a tool, you see.

26:32.224 --> 26:35.394
Nothing more. Power.

26:35.427 --> 26:38.064
Because without power,
who would listen?

26:40.432 --> 26:42.601
Sir, your sister.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.608
Excuse me.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.790
I've been waiting.

27:03.823 --> 27:06.926
Papers to sign.
Always papers.

27:08.260 --> 27:11.530
Is that Laura?

27:11.563 --> 27:13.232
Why do you keep her around?

27:13.265 --> 27:14.901
She's ancient.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.670
-She resents me.
-(door opens, closes
in distance)

27:17.704 --> 27:20.339
I like that.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.109
I need a new house.

27:23.142 --> 27:26.245
No, you want a new house.

27:26.278 --> 27:30.082
Harvey's screwing his masseuse.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.784
So?

27:31.818 --> 27:35.054
You're screwing her, too.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.824
I hate it when you do that.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.527
*

27:44.697 --> 27:45.965
Huh?

27:49.501 --> 27:51.137
Stop!

27:58.310 --> 28:01.413
No more houses.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.816
Okay.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.867
*

28:43.055 --> 28:45.057

29:09.181 --> 29:12.084
-It's always blue!
-Oh!

29:12.118 --> 29:14.120
No.

29:21.527 --> 29:23.095
No. Nope.

29:41.814 --> 29:43.916
(bystanders shouting
in distance)

29:52.224 --> 29:53.392
Fire!

30:08.174 --> 30:10.209
Send in the drone.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.019
(high-pitched
electronic shrieking)

30:28.194 --> 30:30.429
OFFICER:
Move, move, move! Go, go!

indistinct radio chatter)

indistinct whispering)

I'm sorry, I didn't...

Sorry, I didn't mean...

indistinct whispering)

Sir?

Sir.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.355
Sir!

33:43.389 --> 33:45.057
My sister's picking me up.

33:45.091 --> 33:46.058
I-I work here.

33:46.092 --> 33:48.894
You got ID?

33:56.735 --> 33:59.238
Oh, Jesus! Jesus...

34:03.342 --> 34:05.977
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I take medication.

34:06.011 --> 34:08.080
I'm sorry.
I've just... My-my sister...

34:08.114 --> 34:10.682
-Just calm down.

34:10.716 --> 34:11.783
Just trying to figure out
what's going on here.

34:11.817 --> 34:12.818
Hands where I can see them.

Hands where I can see 'em!

34:15.687 --> 34:17.256
There's a... You don't see him?

-Aah!
-Easy.

No, he's not a...

-Amy.
-Back!

34:30.035 --> 34:31.570
Hey, hey,
it's gonna be okay, okay?

34:31.603 --> 34:33.339
Just do what they say, okay?

34:33.372 --> 34:34.340
Try and stay calm, hmm?

34:34.373 --> 34:35.341
-Ow. Ow!
-Hey.

34:35.374 --> 34:37.543
-Hey! You are hurting him. Stop!
-Ow. Ow.

Holy shit. Jerry.

Okay. Help me out, love.

makes branches,

Please.

What am I supposed to do?

39:33.805 --> 39:35.441
Look, I'll take the pills.

39:35.474 --> 39:38.777
You tried to...
with an extension cord.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.279
It wouldn't stop--
the voices-- and...

39:41.312 --> 39:42.848
Shh!

39:42.881 --> 39:46.251

Stop it.

39:46.284 --> 39:48.620

I see...

Stop.

40:07.839 --> 40:09.340
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

40:09.374 --> 40:11.009
I know.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.213
But it is.

40:25.390 --> 40:27.392
I talked to Dr. Kissinger.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.395
He said you'll get
your own room.

40:31.997 --> 40:33.899
It's a nice place.

40:33.932 --> 40:37.235
Clockworks.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.405
It's just until...

40:42.407 --> 40:46.044
It's just for a few weeks.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.818
You promise?

Promise.
