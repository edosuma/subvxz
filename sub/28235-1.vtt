00:48.958 --> 00:51.825
but first: A year has passed since...

00:51.875 --> 00:54.617
the rockslide at Åkerneset
in the Geiranger Fjord...

00:54.667 --> 00:57.989
that resulted in an 80-meter-high tsunami.

00:58.167 --> 01:03.867
248 lives were lost in this brutal
encounter with the forces of nature.

01:03.958 --> 01:05.744
And we have heard powerful stories...

01:05.792 --> 01:08.580
of courage, compassion and survival.

01:08.833 --> 01:12.030
But also questions about
what we as a society...

01:12.125 --> 01:14.662
could have done to prevent such a disaster.

01:14.750 --> 01:18.414
And not least: If something similar
can happen again.

01:19.333 --> 01:23.622
The Geiranger Commission presented
its report this week.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.208
Director and senior research
specialist in Norsar,

01:26.250 --> 01:27.991
Johannes Løberg, welcome.

01:32.250 --> 01:36.289
What is your procedure, as a scientist,

01:36.833 --> 01:40.497
when searching for meaning,
for answers after such an incident?

01:41.375 --> 01:45.414
When we are struck by forces of nature,
we are struck blindly.

01:45.542 --> 01:50.742
Unfortunately, no one can say exactly...

01:50.917 --> 01:54.535
when or where an earthquake will strike.

01:54.625 --> 01:59.665
And particularly a small quake like the one
that triggered the rockslide in Geiranger.

01:59.833 --> 02:04.077
Based on that knowledge,
should anyone live there at all?

02:04.167 --> 02:08.080
Those are extremely difficult
assessments to make.

02:08.583 --> 02:11.075
But we can't live in constant fear.

02:11.333 --> 02:13.540
Because we can't govern nature.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.957
After all, we live in the midst of it.

02:17.333 --> 02:20.371
We aren't going to sit here alone, Løberg.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.411
We are going to invite in a man...

02:22.500 --> 02:26.164
who has justifiably been called
a hero after this tragedy.

02:26.375 --> 02:29.117
But before he comes in,
look at these images.

02:29.208 --> 02:32.576
Are you ready? You'll do fine.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.449
Good luck.

02:55.875 --> 02:59.948
Many of those who were
in Geiranger on May 6 of last year...

03:00.083 --> 03:04.156
have one man to thank
for being alive today:

03:04.708 --> 03:07.450
Please welcome geologist Kristian Eikjord.

05:12.542 --> 05:13.907
Hi.

05:16.958 --> 05:18.323
Hi.

05:24.708 --> 05:26.494
Sorry I'm late.

05:27.083 --> 05:28.244
Did you forget about me?

05:28.583 --> 05:30.620
Forget about you?
No, are you crazy?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.241
It's good to see you.

05:37.625 --> 05:39.457
- Want me to take that?
- Sure.

06:29.417 --> 06:30.953
You must be hungry.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.658
Yeah. A little.

06:34.792 --> 06:40.242
I haven't been to the store.
But... Omelets?

06:40.375 --> 06:41.536
Sure.

06:45.208 --> 06:47.074
Omelets and crispbread?

06:47.375 --> 06:48.831
Sounds great.

07:04.208 --> 07:05.915
How are things going at home?

07:09.208 --> 07:11.074
Any love interests yet?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.161
No.

07:14.667 --> 07:15.907
What about you?

07:16.583 --> 07:17.664
Me?

07:18.292 --> 07:19.578
No way.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.490
Do you miss mom?

07:28.125 --> 07:29.911
Yes. Sometimes.

07:34.375 --> 07:37.037
Maybe things would go better now?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.582
Maybe, I...

07:42.833 --> 07:45.165
I'm doing pretty good here.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.749
"MISSING"

08:56.833 --> 08:59.040
"SURVIVED - LOST EVERYTHING"

09:12.958 --> 09:14.574
Please come.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.707
Julia, please come.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.165
What is this?

09:34.125 --> 09:37.038
It's just something I'm working on.

09:37.250 --> 09:38.786
What is it?

09:41.625 --> 09:42.581
It's getting late. Come on.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.036
Let's go back downstairs.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.582
I don't understand why you have all this.

09:48.042 --> 09:51.364
Julia, it would be impossible
for you to understand.

09:56.667 --> 09:59.125
So many people died in that disaster.

10:00.917 --> 10:03.204
So many people we knew, so many...

10:06.083 --> 10:08.370
You saved mom and Sondre.

10:09.417 --> 10:10.873
You saved me.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.449
Come on. Let's go back downstairs.

10:19.042 --> 10:20.328
Come on.

10:27.792 --> 10:32.616
"THE WHISTLE-BLOWER"

11:22.958 --> 11:25.199
Good morning! I've made breakfast.

11:26.292 --> 11:29.535
Crispbread with cheese and red peppers.

11:30.542 --> 11:33.284
And I reheated yesterday's coffee.

11:38.875 --> 11:40.491
And I cleaned up.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.574
I think it's best you leave.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.073
Leave?

11:51.167 --> 11:52.282
Why?

11:52.375 --> 11:54.366
Julia, you're a big girl now.

11:57.292 --> 12:00.034
You realize I can't have visitors now.

12:00.125 --> 12:02.059
But I thought I was supposed
to leave on Thursday.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.369
I think it's best for you,

12:03.958 --> 12:05.448
considering how dad is feeling now...

12:07.833 --> 12:09.119
that you just go home.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.332
But I've booked a ticket.

12:11.417 --> 12:13.579
Come on. Let's go pack.

14:23.333 --> 14:24.869
"OSLOFJORD TUNNEL,"

14:24.875 --> 14:27.537
"29KM FROM OSLO CITY CENTER"

16:13.875 --> 16:17.288
tunnel. The cause of
the accident is still unknown,

16:17.500 --> 16:19.116
but the police have supplied...

16:19.167 --> 16:22.205
some information regarding
the serious accident.

16:22.250 --> 16:25.083
It was quickly established
that two lives were lost.

16:25.875 --> 16:29.368
The Oslofjord Tunnel is
now closed in both directions...

16:29.417 --> 16:31.374
and it is not known when it will reopen.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.325
There are 32 subsea tunnels in Norway...

16:34.375 --> 16:37.037
with a steeper gradient than
the Oslofjord Tunnel,

16:37.083 --> 16:41.702
but many have complained
that this one is too steep.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.705
The identities of
the two deceased have now been confirmed.

16:44.750 --> 16:48.914
They are Inga Hansen and Konrad Lindblom.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.742
Their next of kin have been notified.

16:51.792 --> 16:55.535
Lindblom worked as a geologist for Norsar.

16:55.792 --> 17:00.161
He was allegedly not involved with the
ongoing construction work in the tunnel.

17:00.208 --> 17:04.122
Our reporter Mats Andersen arrived at
the scene shortly after the incident.

17:04.208 --> 17:07.371
There have been many accidents in
the Oslofjord Tunnel.

17:07.416 --> 17:12.992
Now two people have died in there.

17:13.333 --> 17:17.281
And this after many people
have demanded it be shut down for good.

17:17.333 --> 17:21.622
We are not allowed inside the tunnel,
but what we know,

17:21.666 --> 17:25.455
what the police have told us,
is that the two people...

17:25.500 --> 17:28.162
were killed by falling
debris in the tunnel.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.928
I am here with a representative from
the Public Roads Administration.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.788
What can you tell us about...

18:16.708 --> 18:19.291
"Dear Kristian, It's been a while..."

18:22.333 --> 18:24.449

It's good to see you.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.038
Beard and all. I hardly recognized you.

21:20.750 --> 21:21.865
Coffee?

21:21.958 --> 21:23.119
Sure, if you have some.

21:26.208 --> 21:28.324
Ingrid, do you have those copies for us?

21:28.417 --> 21:29.953
Yes.

21:30.042 --> 21:31.908
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

21:32.000 --> 21:38.827
I think I have gone through

No movement at any of them?

21:54.667 --> 21:56.203
No.

22:01.500 --> 22:04.367
I don't mean to speak ill of Konrad,

22:04.417 --> 22:07.284
he was a good man. But he could...

22:08.542 --> 22:12.740
He could sometimes go a little too
far with his alternative theories.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.947
And our measurements have never
been more precise than they are today.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.288
We are at a detail level we
could only dream about.

22:22.583 --> 22:25.120
Pull up that 3.8 from Bergen last year.

22:25.333 --> 22:26.789
Let's see.

22:27.250 --> 22:28.456
Look at that.

22:41.792 --> 22:43.908
So there were several movements that day?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.458
No, the yellow dots are man-made tremors.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.788
Things like construction, blasting.

22:49.833 --> 22:52.621
Only the red dots are
confirmed earthquakes.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.624
So... Norway will be just fine.

22:58.542 --> 23:03.366
And if anything should happen,
Ingrid is here keeping an eye on things.

23:08.583 --> 23:10.620
We kept an eye on things in Geiranger too.

23:13.583 --> 23:16.325
Of course, but Kristian...

Hi.

24:57.333 --> 24:58.915
Hi.

24:59.542 --> 25:02.034
My name is Kristian Eikjord.

25:02.958 --> 25:04.448
I worked with Konrad.

25:06.417 --> 25:07.748
I see.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.874
Then you know that he's dead?

25:12.958 --> 25:17.247
Of course. Are you family?

25:17.875 --> 25:21.743
Konrad is my father. Or was my father.

25:23.167 --> 25:26.865
I'm sorry. My condolences.

25:30.750 --> 25:33.708
But you said you worked together?

25:34.083 --> 25:35.539
Yes, or...

25:36.250 --> 25:39.163
Konrad was a friend, and he contacted me.

25:39.250 --> 25:41.036
I didn't think dad had any friends.

25:41.167 --> 25:43.659
Well, we were maybe more
colleagues than friends, but...

25:45.333 --> 25:47.074
I'm very interested in his work.

25:48.708 --> 25:50.574
There are some documents I need to see...

25:50.667 --> 25:53.705
Go have a look in his office.

25:54.042 --> 25:56.283
The funeral home is calling.

25:56.375 --> 25:57.080
You sure?

25:57.167 --> 25:59.158
Yes. It all has to go anyway.

25:59.583 --> 26:00.823
Thank you.

28:21.875 --> 28:23.115
Hi, Kristian.

28:23.625 --> 28:26.208
How do we know
the yellow dots aren't actually red?

28:26.292 --> 28:28.033
What do you mean?

28:28.125 --> 28:32.824
How do we know what's man-made
and what tremors are caused by nature?

28:32.917 --> 28:35.329
Like I said, it's
construction work, blasting.

28:35.375 --> 28:36.831
It happens all the time.

28:36.917 --> 28:39.284
I realize that, but how do we know?

28:39.375 --> 28:41.787
The contractors report it.

28:41.875 --> 28:45.448
Are you telling me they report
every time they blast?

28:45.542 --> 28:47.874
No, they report the project.

28:49.792 --> 28:52.392
So the contractor reports their activity
from one date to another,

28:52.708 --> 28:55.575
that covers the entire construction period?

28:55.667 --> 28:56.907
Yes, basically.

28:57.250 --> 29:00.038
And there's construction work in
the Oslofjord Tunnel right now?

29:00.125 --> 29:01.581
Yes.

29:04.375 --> 29:05.615
Call that contractor.

29:07.625 --> 29:09.616
Kristian, that's a little...

29:10.667 --> 29:14.365
Please just do me this one favor
and I won't bother you anymore, OK?

29:14.458 --> 29:17.576
If there wasn't any construction
going on that day...

29:19.583 --> 29:21.244
what was it then?

29:22.042 --> 29:25.239
Kristian, I'll make some calls, OK?

29:25.333 --> 29:26.789

31:15.458 --> 31:16.698
So do you.

31:21.833 --> 31:22.833
And Julia?

31:23.167 --> 31:24.828
She's actually in bed.

31:26.292 --> 31:27.703
OK.

31:29.958 --> 31:31.915
She forgot this.

31:44.500 --> 31:47.743
She has her dress rehearsal
at the opera tomorrow.

31:48.292 --> 31:50.124
What, is she singing?

31:51.833 --> 31:52.948
Dancing ballet.

32:10.750 --> 32:11.831
You can come watch.

32:11.875 --> 32:14.583
Would you like to do that?
If you have time.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.374
Of course.

32:19.125 --> 32:20.991
She'd like that.

32:22.792 --> 32:26.740
I'm sorry about what happened
with Julia in Geiranger.

32:30.750 --> 32:33.333
We both know things haven't
been easy for me of late.

32:39.875 --> 32:43.448
Sometimes I think it must be
lovely to just lie down on your back...

32:43.500 --> 32:45.787
with your feet in the air
and have a little breakdown.

32:52.333 --> 32:54.244
You should give it a try. It's pretty nice.

33:08.917 --> 33:10.703
Idun?

33:17.917 --> 33:19.749
What I'm about to tell you...

33:21.375 --> 33:23.161
is going to sound completely insane.

33:24.708 --> 33:26.244
I don't mean to scare you.

33:32.250 --> 33:33.536
Sure, it's an old building.

33:33.583 --> 33:35.103
But this is the second time this week.

33:41.292 --> 33:42.703
These look fine.

33:44.042 --> 33:46.204
Maybe a little warm. Hold this.

33:59.708 --> 34:04.373
Could you shine the light here? Hello?

34:13.458 --> 34:15.018
Could you give me some light, Kristian?

34:18.625 --> 34:20.331
Now what do we do?

34:48.667 --> 34:50.123
Idun, it's OK.

34:50.208 --> 34:51.414
No.

34:55.542 --> 34:57.374
It isn't OK.

34:59.375 --> 35:01.992
I understand why you left me.

35:02.667 --> 35:03.907
What I was about to tell you...

35:03.958 --> 35:06.325
Kristian, I didn't leave you.

35:06.375 --> 35:07.490
You left us.

35:31.667 --> 35:32.202
Hi.

35:32.292 --> 35:32.872
Hi.

35:32.958 --> 35:36.246
Hello. I can't wait to see you!

35:36.625 --> 35:39.583
Mom, when is dad coming?

35:39.667 --> 35:41.874
I'm not sure. But he knows when it starts.

35:43.125 --> 35:44.661
Dad's coming to watch today.

35:44.750 --> 35:46.491
Cool!

35:46.583 --> 35:48.119
Are you nervous?

35:48.208 --> 35:48.788
Break a leg!

35:48.875 --> 35:50.081
Break a leg!

35:53.042 --> 35:54.749
Hello?

35:55.833 --> 35:56.948
Hello?

35:57.042 --> 35:58.203
In here.

36:04.417 --> 36:06.033
What are you doing?

36:06.125 --> 36:07.786
I think your dad was onto something big.

36:08.250 --> 36:12.073
I'm afraid I need to lock up. I have to go.

36:14.708 --> 36:17.184
Haven't you ever had the sense
that something is about to happen,

36:17.208 --> 36:18.790
but you don't know what?

36:20.417 --> 36:23.375
I grew up with a dad who
always had that sense.

36:24.708 --> 36:27.075
He couldn't even drive
by a pile of rocks...

36:27.125 --> 36:29.082
without bringing some samples home.

36:29.125 --> 36:30.911
In case there was something there.

36:38.833 --> 36:40.415
Have you read this?

36:45.375 --> 36:46.991
But he was wrong.

36:48.708 --> 36:51.291
Yes, maybe regarding the timing.

36:51.333 --> 36:53.324
But what he was right about is...

36:53.375 --> 36:54.831
if a quake hits Oslo today,

36:54.875 --> 36:57.742
say it isn't as powerful as in 1904.

36:57.750 --> 36:59.582
Say it's a six

37:00.792 --> 37:01.953
An eight.

37:02.375 --> 37:04.036
That isn't twice as powerful.

37:05.333 --> 37:09.827
It's a million times more powerful.
Thousands of people will die.

37:11.250 --> 37:13.617
I really have to go.

37:13.667 --> 37:15.908
But maybe you found some
of what you were looking for?

37:15.958 --> 37:17.398
Feel free to take whatever you want.

37:17.458 --> 37:20.450
Know what?
This may be hard for you to hear right now.

37:20.917 --> 37:24.455
But some things are
more important than a daughter.

37:25.625 --> 37:29.118
Or a son. Or a family.

37:37.000 --> 37:42.746
OK. But either way, I have to leave.

37:43.042 --> 37:46.489
I have to pick out songs
for my dad's funeral.

37:46.542 --> 37:48.249
Because he had something "important"...

37:48.292 --> 37:49.874
to do in the Oslofjord tunnel.

37:54.375 --> 37:56.241
Do you know why I think he was there?

37:58.083 --> 37:59.083
No.

37:59.167 --> 38:00.703
Because he wanted to save you.

38:02.917 --> 38:05.204
You. And many others.

38:09.958 --> 38:11.448
I need to see that tunnel.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.662
I am not going down in that tunnel.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.673
Don't you wonder what he
was doing down there?

38:29.250 --> 38:30.536
This is important.

39:07.125 --> 39:08.240
What?

40:40.250 --> 40:41.911
Can't we just leave?

40:43.542 --> 40:44.748
Hang on.

41:46.667 --> 41:48.578
Hold this.

42:47.833 --> 42:49.915
Can you give me some light?

43:26.250 --> 43:27.250
Kristian?

43:27.292 --> 43:28.703
In a minute.

44:25.750 --> 44:26.364
Hi, Idun.

44:26.375 --> 44:27.035
Hi.

44:27.042 --> 44:28.042
Hi there.

44:28.458 --> 44:29.493
Where are you?

44:29.500 --> 44:31.491
I'm so sorry.

44:31.500 --> 44:32.410
Are you coming?

44:32.417 --> 44:36.706
I was on my way.
But then something came up.

44:37.833 --> 44:38.948
So I was delayed.

44:38.958 --> 44:40.540
OK. Are you close?

44:41.125 --> 44:42.206
I...

44:44.833 --> 44:47.825
Kristian? Are you there?

44:48.917 --> 44:51.705
Hello? Are you there?

44:51.917 --> 44:53.453
Hello? Can you hear me?

44:53.542 --> 44:54.542
Yes, I hear you.

44:54.917 --> 44:56.533
Are you coming, or not?

44:56.542 --> 44:57.202
We're on our way.

44:57.208 --> 44:57.993
Huh?

44:58.125 --> 44:59.581
We're on our way.

45:20.458 --> 45:21.948
Hello? Idun?

45:22.417 --> 45:24.874
Idun, can you hear me?

45:24.875 --> 45:26.661
Idun? Hello?

45:45.583 --> 45:47.199
Julia?

45:54.625 --> 45:55.956
Julia!

46:01.125 --> 46:02.365
Idun?

46:04.250 --> 46:05.581
Kristian...

46:24.625 --> 46:26.411
Hi, have you seen Julia?

46:26.417 --> 46:27.828
She's over there.

46:28.792 --> 46:30.408
Hey, you aren't allowed in here!

46:30.417 --> 46:31.202
Julia?

46:31.208 --> 46:32.118
You have to leave!

46:32.125 --> 46:33.240
Have you seen my daughter?

46:33.250 --> 46:33.955
You have to leave!

46:33.958 --> 46:34.976
I'm looking for my daughter!

46:35.000 --> 46:36.536
She was on stage.

46:36.625 --> 46:37.660
Didn't you hear me?

46:37.708 --> 46:38.368
There's no one here!

46:38.458 --> 46:39.994
Julia?

46:40.083 --> 46:41.414
Everyone has left.

46:41.458 --> 46:42.414
It isn't safe in here.

46:42.458 --> 46:43.289
You have to get out!

46:43.375 --> 46:44.740
Julia?

46:45.792 --> 46:47.123
Julia?

46:54.583 --> 46:57.416
Hi! Are you hurt?

46:57.792 --> 46:59.032
Are you OK?

46:59.375 --> 47:00.865
Come on out, honey.

47:00.875 --> 47:03.082
Come on. We have to go.

47:03.167 --> 47:03.872
Where is dad?

47:03.875 --> 47:04.990
He didn't come.

47:05.125 --> 47:06.581
I'm sure he's fine.

47:06.792 --> 47:08.157
We have to get out of here.

47:08.333 --> 47:11.291
Come on. Everything will be OK.

47:13.083 --> 47:15.040
Come on. Come to me.

47:47.458 --> 47:48.914
Hello, Idun?

47:49.042 --> 47:50.498
Hi. We're on our way home.

47:50.542 --> 47:51.623
Meet us here.

47:51.708 --> 47:53.574
OK, I'll be right there.

47:53.667 --> 47:54.577
Good.

47:54.667 --> 47:55.873
OK.

48:10.917 --> 48:13.830
Johannes. It was a quake, wasn't it?

48:13.917 --> 48:15.578
What are you doing here?

48:15.667 --> 48:17.453
Come on. They've contacted you.

48:18.333 --> 48:19.698
It was an earthquake, wasn't it?

48:21.375 --> 48:22.410
There was some movement.

48:22.458 --> 48:23.948
We're looking into it.

48:25.250 --> 48:26.661
Some movement?

48:28.833 --> 48:30.619
You see what's happening, right?

48:32.667 --> 48:34.658
I need to go do my job.

49:07.417 --> 49:09.124
Hey!

49:20.208 --> 49:22.040
That... is Oslo.

49:25.375 --> 49:27.742
Know why Konrad was in that tunnel?

49:28.583 --> 49:30.369
He was taking stone samples.

49:31.042 --> 49:33.249
And that is the sample he failed to take.

49:35.625 --> 49:37.957
Just give me a minute.

49:41.958 --> 49:43.494
Kristian... That sample.

49:43.542 --> 49:46.955
It doesn't prove anything.

49:47.833 --> 49:51.030
We already know that the rock conditions
around the Oslofjord Tunnel are poor.

49:51.083 --> 49:55.156
But just because some rocks fall in
the Oslofjord Tunnel...

49:56.542 --> 49:57.976
doesn't mean an earthquake is imminent

49:58.000 --> 50:01.664
It just means another accident
in Norway's most accident-ridden tunnel.

50:03.625 --> 50:05.332
Those yellow dots of yours...

50:05.583 --> 50:08.245
The earthquake is hiding behind the blasts.

50:08.417 --> 50:10.875
Those blasts are simply camouflage.

50:14.417 --> 50:15.953
Look.

50:18.333 --> 50:19.744
Look at this pillar.

50:20.542 --> 50:21.828
This isn't about blasting.

50:21.875 --> 50:23.036
It isn't about camouflage.

50:23.083 --> 50:24.699
It's about a construction flaw.

50:25.375 --> 50:27.601
The movement we registered
was caused by the Opera itself.

50:27.625 --> 50:29.851
If there had been
an earthquake we wouldn't be standing here.

50:29.875 --> 50:32.663
This entire area is built on marine clay.

50:32.917 --> 50:35.909
That's like jello at a
child's birthday party.

50:35.958 --> 50:38.620
A little push in one corner,
and everything will start shaking.

50:39.792 --> 50:41.408
You've had power outages...

50:41.500 --> 50:46.074
Kristian. There can be
a thousand reasons for a power outage.

50:54.083 --> 50:55.448
I know this isn't easy.

50:55.500 --> 50:57.707
You survived a disaster.

50:57.750 --> 50:59.476
I can't even imagine the nightmare
you have been through.

50:59.500 --> 51:01.820
But that doesn't mean disasters
follow you wherever you go.

51:06.458 --> 51:08.825
Please, Kristian, just leave.

51:49.875 --> 51:53.493
Kristian? What's happening?

52:01.625 --> 52:02.786
Go home.

52:34.750 --> 52:40.496
There can be many reasons
for a construction error in a pillar.

52:40.542 --> 52:42.704
That's what we're looking into.

52:42.792 --> 52:47.912
It was quite dramatic for
the children at the Opera in Oslo...

52:55.750 --> 52:57.491
Where were you?

52:59.708 --> 53:01.745
Why didn't you come?

53:06.292 --> 53:07.874
I apologize.

53:12.917 --> 53:14.624
I'm sorry.

53:18.500 --> 53:20.207
But I'm here now.

53:25.083 --> 53:26.744
Why are you here?

53:30.125 --> 53:31.081
Why come here?

53:31.125 --> 53:32.125
What do you want?

53:34.292 --> 53:36.124
I'm not quite sure.

53:39.625 --> 53:43.573
Christ, I keep looking
for disasters wherever I go.

53:48.083 --> 53:49.790
We miss you.

53:51.667 --> 53:54.079
Can't you at least try to be a father?

53:55.958 --> 53:57.494
Idun, you don't understand...

53:57.583 --> 53:59.415
What don't I understand?

54:01.125 --> 54:02.911
What don't I understand?

54:03.583 --> 54:05.745
I was in Geiranger too.

54:08.708 --> 54:10.415
You did everything you could, Kristian.

54:10.458 --> 54:11.914
You saved many people.

54:13.167 --> 54:15.204
And your family survived.

54:15.667 --> 54:17.283
We were fortunate.

54:19.333 --> 54:20.619
We're here.

54:20.667 --> 54:22.078
All of us.

55:34.917 --> 55:36.874
So your computer system registered...

55:36.917 --> 55:41.081
the power failure at the Opera at 20:05:18?

55:42.917 --> 55:48.412
And the accident happened a few
seconds later, say 20:05:30.

55:49.875 --> 55:50.875
Yes. Good.

55:51.167 --> 55:53.408
Thank you. Bye.

55:54.833 --> 55:58.030
Can you give me the time for
the movement at the Opera yesterday?

55:58.125 --> 55:59.160
Yes.

56:06.958 --> 56:11.498
It was registered at 20:04:57.

56:28.875 --> 56:29.956
Yes. Oops!

56:33.208 --> 56:35.324
I just stepped in some water.

56:36.875 --> 56:39.788
OK. I'm on my way now.

56:39.833 --> 56:41.119
I'll have a look at it.

56:50.292 --> 56:52.499
My foot got soaked.

58:21.042 --> 58:22.123
Hi.

58:24.250 --> 58:25.250
Hi.

58:29.250 --> 58:30.581
Sure you're ready for this, dad?

58:32.250 --> 58:34.241
The whole family, and all?

58:36.500 --> 58:38.332
I hope so.

58:39.583 --> 58:41.290
So you'll be staying a while?

58:43.375 --> 58:44.831
I sure hope so.

58:49.875 --> 58:50.875
Good.

58:50.917 --> 58:51.917
Hi!

58:51.958 --> 58:52.958
Hi.

58:59.667 --> 59:00.953
Hi.

59:01.042 --> 59:02.042
Hi.

59:19.292 --> 59:20.828
Where are you going?

59:20.917 --> 59:22.373
To the university.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.035
Now?

59:24.667 --> 59:25.667
Yeah.

59:26.333 --> 59:27.333
Don't you want any food?

59:27.375 --> 59:30.117
No, I'm all set. Bye.

59:31.792 --> 59:33.032
Bye.

59:39.792 --> 59:41.533
Are you and mom back together again?

59:47.625 --> 59:49.787
Honestly, I don't know.

01:00:00.708 --> 01:00:01.493
Hi.

01:00:01.583 --> 01:00:03.324
Hi. I have to show you something.

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:04.785
OK.

01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:10.574
Yes, any activities of yours.

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:11.956
Blasting and so on.

01:00:12.458 --> 01:00:14.040
Over all of Oslo.

01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:16.787
No, there's no cause for concern.

01:00:16.833 --> 01:00:19.825
We're just performing a study. Thank you.

01:00:20.458 --> 01:00:22.825
Johannes, look at this.

01:00:42.667 --> 01:00:44.908
It looks like some sort of system.

01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:52.823
It's a warning system.

01:00:56.292 --> 01:00:59.364
Gas. Gas is killing those rats!

01:00:59.458 --> 01:01:00.573
Gas?

01:01:00.667 --> 01:01:01.748
A limnic eruption.

01:01:01.833 --> 01:01:02.948
Hi.

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.536
A limnic what?

01:01:06.167 --> 01:01:09.080
Toxic gases seep through the rock.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:12.287
Lake Nyos in Cameroon, 1986.

01:01:12.375 --> 01:01:15.288
But gas? I thought you
were worried about an earthquake.

01:01:15.667 --> 01:01:17.328
That is what I'm worried about.

01:01:22.542 --> 01:01:23.998
And it's happening right now.

01:01:28.542 --> 01:01:29.953
Go get dressed.

01:01:37.208 --> 01:01:41.327
Nausea is a physiological process
where we reject...

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:48.535
Put your seat belt on.

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:49.239
Where are we going?

01:01:49.333 --> 01:01:50.243
To get your mom.

01:01:50.292 --> 01:01:51.373
Answer, dammit!

01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:58.787
What? Tell me more, Idun.

01:01:59.292 --> 01:02:01.579
I don't know what to say.

01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:05.540
Wasn't he off his rocker last fall?

01:02:05.583 --> 01:02:06.914
Is he back to normal?

01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:09.783
Right now he is, yes.

01:02:11.458 --> 01:02:13.995
What will happen the
next time he goes nuts?

01:02:19.625 --> 01:02:22.037
Hey, everything will be fine.

01:02:23.542 --> 01:02:25.328
Keep going. Go! Go!

01:02:34.708 --> 01:02:38.326
In cultures such as England and Norway...

01:02:39.292 --> 01:02:40.908
What? Again?

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:41.865
Sorry.

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:44.165
Read it out loud, if it's so important.

01:02:45.292 --> 01:02:46.703
Where were we?

01:02:49.417 --> 01:02:52.535
"From Dad: IF YOU'RE INSIDE A BUILDING,
GET OUT NOW!"

01:02:52.667 --> 01:02:54.157
What is it?

01:02:54.833 --> 01:02:55.994
Nothing.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.116
Why are we driving so fast?

01:03:16.833 --> 01:03:18.540
This is the police.

01:03:18.625 --> 01:03:21.788
I have placed four bombs at the University.

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:25.059
They will go off in ten minutes.

01:03:25.083 --> 01:03:26.164
At the University?

01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:28.241
Yes, at the University!

01:03:31.792 --> 01:03:32.792
Take a left here.

01:03:32.833 --> 01:03:33.833
I can't!

01:03:33.917 --> 01:03:35.453
Go straight in!

01:03:51.875 --> 01:03:52.990
Wait, dad!

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.453
I'll be right back.

01:03:55.542 --> 01:03:56.407
Don't leave me.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.768
Please. I'll be right back. I promise.

01:03:57.792 --> 01:03:59.157
I'm just going to get your mom.

01:03:59.208 --> 01:04:00.994
You stay here with Marit.

01:04:01.042 --> 01:04:02.703
Can you promise me that? Please.

01:04:02.792 --> 01:04:05.659
Marit? Keep an eye on Julia!

01:04:06.125 --> 01:04:07.125
Dad!

01:04:12.625 --> 01:04:13.740
Yes, I understand.

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:15.417
Hi.

01:04:17.625 --> 01:04:20.208
I'll take a look at that.

01:04:20.667 --> 01:04:21.873
Can I call you back?

01:04:21.917 --> 01:04:22.702
Idun Eikjord.

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:23.976
I need to talk to her right now.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.081
There's been an accident.

01:04:25.125 --> 01:04:25.990
I need to talk to her.

01:04:26.042 --> 01:04:26.782
Where is she?

01:04:26.875 --> 01:04:27.580
Idun?

01:04:27.667 --> 01:04:28.281
Idun.

01:04:28.375 --> 01:04:29.991
I think she's on 34.

01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:30.914
34?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.582
The 34th floor.

01:04:32.667 --> 01:04:33.667
Shit!

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:36.162
The last elevator, all the way up.

01:05:18.917 --> 01:05:19.497
Hi, Kristian.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.285
Johannes?

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.418
If you haven't seen anything
on your screens yet.

01:05:22.792 --> 01:05:25.910
I promise you that very soon
you'll see massive movement.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:26.740
Kristian...

01:05:26.833 --> 01:05:27.618
If we don't prepare...

01:05:27.667 --> 01:05:28.953
We have some...

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.198
Call someone!

01:05:30.958 --> 01:05:31.868
Who?

01:05:31.875 --> 01:05:33.491
We have to start warning people.

01:05:34.542 --> 01:05:36.203
Can we talk later?

01:05:36.292 --> 01:05:37.327
There won't be any "later"!

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.414
Please, call someone.

01:05:38.583 --> 01:05:39.583
I don't know.

01:05:39.625 --> 01:05:41.536
Sound the air-raid siren.

01:05:41.667 --> 01:05:43.624
Johannes? Johannes?

01:05:55.542 --> 01:05:59.536
Metaphorically in the
right way, so that the...

01:06:05.125 --> 01:06:07.332
Mia, we have to get out of here, now.

01:06:07.458 --> 01:06:09.825
I have a bad feeling. We have to get out.

01:06:12.125 --> 01:06:13.490
Hang on.

01:06:16.417 --> 01:06:19.910
Maybe we should vacate the premises?

01:06:23.417 --> 01:06:24.828
Never mind.

01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:29.702
Note the metaphors that are
used for animals that are hunted...

01:06:42.667 --> 01:06:44.749
Move! I have a delivery.

01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:46.415
Can't you just drive around me?

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:51.741
Fine, I'll move!

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:00.490
Julia?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.115
Julia?

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:09.116
Julia! Julia!

01:07:48.708 --> 01:07:50.494
Give me a second.

01:07:52.542 --> 01:07:53.282
Hi.

01:07:53.542 --> 01:07:54.282
You have to come with me.

01:07:54.292 --> 01:07:54.906
What is it?

01:07:54.917 --> 01:07:55.622
Everyone has to get out of here.

01:07:55.625 --> 01:07:56.160
Huh?

01:07:56.167 --> 01:07:57.447
Everyone has to get out of here.

01:07:58.167 --> 01:07:59.123
An earthquake is about to happen.

01:07:59.125 --> 01:08:00.286
Kristian, please calm down.

01:08:00.292 --> 01:08:01.692
And it's about to happen right now.

01:08:02.167 --> 01:08:03.123
We can't stay up here.

01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:04.490
This is the worst possible place to be.

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.581
We have to get out now!

01:08:05.583 --> 01:08:07.165
Kristian, calm down.

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:08.956
Calm down.

01:08:09.542 --> 01:08:13.160
If an earthquake was imminent,
surely someone would know.

01:08:13.167 --> 01:08:14.373
They would warn us.

01:08:15.667 --> 01:08:19.035
There is no warning. Come on!

01:08:22.875 --> 01:08:23.865
I'll go down with you

01:08:23.875 --> 01:08:27.037
and we'll sit down
and talk over a cup of coffee, OK?

01:08:37.875 --> 01:08:39.331
Excuse me, everyone.

01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:41.916
Please leave the building.

01:08:42.207 --> 01:08:44.950
Do you have any idea
how much a false alarm costs?

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:51.872
Julia!

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.741
Since you triggered the alarm,

01:08:55.875 --> 01:08:58.867
the elevators descend automatically to
the ground floor.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.740
Why is Julia here?

01:09:02.875 --> 01:09:05.662
This transformation is interesting...

01:09:05.667 --> 01:09:07.078
Let's get out of here.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.412
Hey, I've had enough of you.
Can't you just...

01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:12.828
The alarm sounded. We should leave.

01:09:12.832 --> 01:09:16.029
The alarm has stopped.
Either sit down, or leave.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.242
You should all leave with me.

01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:22.412
I'm in the middle of a lecture here.
Either sit down, or leave.

01:09:24.625 --> 01:09:25.956
Don't panic.

01:09:26.875 --> 01:09:29.367
Remain calm and just go to the stairs.

01:09:29.417 --> 01:09:31.828
Everyone needs to leave.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.786
No signal?

01:10:21.333 --> 01:10:23.165
Hello?

01:10:34.333 --> 01:10:35.573
Johannes?

01:12:32.583 --> 01:12:34.199
Get down! Get down!

01:14:44.625 --> 01:14:45.911
Julia?

01:15:04.708 --> 01:15:06.415
Idun?

01:15:11.958 --> 01:15:14.825
Idun? Idun...

01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:18.328
Idun?

01:15:19.042 --> 01:15:20.453
Are you all right?

01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:23.783
Look at me. Look at me.

01:15:23.875 --> 01:15:25.536
Is everything OK?

01:15:27.167 --> 01:15:28.453
Look at me.

01:15:29.167 --> 01:15:32.080
Are you OK?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.788
Say something, Idun. Please.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.115
Idun?

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:54.956
Julia!

01:17:12.667 --> 01:17:14.954
Hi, can you hear me?

01:17:15.708 --> 01:17:17.073
Are you OK, Julia?

01:17:26.542 --> 01:17:28.453
Grab there, and pull.

01:17:30.667 --> 01:17:33.409
OK, on three I want you to pull.

01:17:34.542 --> 01:17:37.079
One, two, three!

01:17:38.083 --> 01:17:41.656
Pull! Pull!

01:18:07.625 --> 01:18:14.747
No! Julia! Julia!

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.786
We'll get through this.

01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:39.082
But we have to do it together.

01:18:43.333 --> 01:18:45.244
You and me.

01:19:34.542 --> 01:19:35.998
There's an opening down there.

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:58.124
Are you OK?

01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:22.993
Hold here. Press as hard <i>as</i> you can.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.536
No!

01:21:01.083 --> 01:21:01.993
Julia, run!

01:21:02.042 --> 01:21:03.077
Up there!

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:04.411
As fast as you can!

01:21:04.458 --> 01:21:05.458
Run!

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:45.491
Hang on!

01:22:47.375 --> 01:22:48.536
No!

01:22:50.708 --> 01:22:51.823
No!

01:22:54.667 --> 01:22:56.328
Grab something!

01:23:32.042 --> 01:23:33.407
Julia!

01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:07.664
Idun?

01:24:08.375 --> 01:24:10.537
Idun! Look out!

01:24:37.542 --> 01:24:38.782
Idun?

01:25:07.125 --> 01:25:08.411
Can you move?

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:11.865
There will be aftershocks.

01:25:12.833 --> 01:25:14.119
So we have to get out of here.

01:25:15.042 --> 01:25:17.409
We have to get down and
out through that opening.

01:25:18.208 --> 01:25:19.698
And then we'll get Julia.

01:26:38.708 --> 01:26:40.324
No.

01:27:28.667 --> 01:27:29.702
Idun?

01:27:31.458 --> 01:27:32.458
Idun.

01:27:32.917 --> 01:27:35.284
Stand up, and I'll swing this over.

01:27:35.458 --> 01:27:36.323
I know you can do it.

01:27:36.333 --> 01:27:37.333
Come on.

01:27:37.875 --> 01:27:39.240
I'll catch you.

01:27:39.292 --> 01:27:40.498
Julia's waiting up there.

01:27:40.542 --> 01:27:41.542
Come on.

01:27:52.333 --> 01:27:54.495
Come on. Stand up.

01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:59.037
Come on. That's good.

01:28:00.458 --> 01:28:02.244
Excellent.

01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:13.949
I'll swing it over to you, and you grab it.

01:28:15.792 --> 01:28:17.157
OK.

01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:18.866
I'll let go, and you grab it.

01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:28.530
Just hang on. I'll grab you. Come on.

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.241
Hang on!

01:29:07.833 --> 01:29:11.326
Just climb up a little bit,
and I'll grab you.

01:29:12.125 --> 01:29:12.660
Kristian...

01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:16.914
Come on. Come on, please.

01:29:23.792 --> 01:29:25.203
I can't do it.

01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:28.206
Please, don't...

01:29:28.417 --> 01:29:30.454
Please.

01:29:33.625 --> 01:29:34.990
I love you.

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.411
Don't say that.

01:29:39.417 --> 01:29:41.374
Idun, don't...

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:43.161
Just a little higher.

01:29:52.208 --> 01:29:53.790
You have to save Julia.

01:29:54.250 --> 01:29:56.036
Idun, no!

01:29:57.750 --> 01:30:01.288
Just climb up a little further,
and I'll grab you.

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.865
Do you hear me?

01:30:07.083 --> 01:30:08.573
Just a few inches,

01:30:08.625 --> 01:30:10.286
and I can grab you. Please!

01:30:17.417 --> 01:30:19.124
Just a little further.

01:30:19.167 --> 01:30:20.453
That's it!

01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:22.207
Come on, come on.

01:30:29.292 --> 01:30:30.578
Come on.

01:32:11.625 --> 01:32:12.865
Help!

01:32:15.125 --> 01:32:16.832
Help!

01:32:17.583 --> 01:32:18.368
Marit?

01:32:18.375 --> 01:32:19.911
We're down here!

01:32:21.292 --> 01:32:22.453
Julia?

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:23.661
Dad!

01:32:24.042 --> 01:32:26.704
She's over here! Help!

01:32:38.792 --> 01:32:40.032
I'm coming!

01:33:09.542 --> 01:33:10.828
Dad!

01:33:16.542 --> 01:33:17.703
Hi!

01:33:22.625 --> 01:33:24.832
I thought I had lost you.

01:33:29.833 --> 01:33:31.198
Let me look at you.

01:33:45.625 --> 01:33:47.161
Where's mom?

01:34:07.708 --> 01:34:09.290
Where's mom?

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.958
I'm so sorry.

01:34:30.583 --> 01:34:32.369
Don't leave me.

01:34:37.958 --> 01:34:38.914
Look at me.

01:34:38.917 --> 01:34:40.157
I'm staying right here.

01:34:40.167 --> 01:34:41.373
I promise.

01:34:53.792 --> 01:34:54.998
Thank you.

01:35:01.375 --> 01:35:03.116
Listen to me.

01:35:04.667 --> 01:35:06.157
We have to get out of here.

01:35:06.542 --> 01:35:07.748
OK?

01:35:10.792 --> 01:35:12.032
Come on.

01:35:40.667 --> 01:35:41.748
No!

01:35:42.125 --> 01:35:43.286
Julia!

01:35:50.250 --> 01:35:51.250
Julia!

01:36:03.125 --> 01:36:04.411
Julia!

01:36:12.042 --> 01:36:13.077
Dad!

01:36:15.667 --> 01:36:16.828
Julia!

01:36:21.083 --> 01:36:22.198
Dad!

01:36:34.833 --> 01:36:35.698
Dad!

01:36:35.708 --> 01:36:40.077
Julia! Don't move!

01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:19.458
Julia! Don't move!

01:37:20.125 --> 01:37:20.739
Marit!

01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:21.750
I'm coming!

01:37:23.417 --> 01:37:24.782
Marit!

01:37:32.542 --> 01:37:33.623
Dad!

01:37:52.625 --> 01:37:54.036
Dad!

01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:56.081

01:37:59.333 --> 01:38:00.333
Marit!

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:01.500
Yes!

01:38:18.625 --> 01:38:20.662
I need you to grab Julia!

01:38:21.417 --> 01:38:22.417
OK.

01:38:26.083 --> 01:38:27.949
I'll swing her over. Ready?

01:38:27.958 --> 01:38:28.958
Ready.

01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:32.038
Julia, I'm going to swing you over now.

01:38:32.042 --> 01:38:34.625
I'll count to three, OK?

01:38:38.083 --> 01:38:41.656
One, two... three!

01:38:44.125 --> 01:38:45.125
Let go!

01:38:45.875 --> 01:38:47.457
Julia, you have to let go.

01:38:48.958 --> 01:38:51.495
I've got you, Julia.

01:38:52.958 --> 01:38:55.040
Let go of me now.

01:38:56.375 --> 01:38:57.957
Julia, let go of your dad!

01:38:58.250 --> 01:38:58.864
Let go of him!

01:38:58.875 --> 01:39:00.161
Let go.
