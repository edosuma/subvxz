[TV playing]

00:03.700 --> 00:04.667
[turns off TV]

00:04.700 --> 00:05.633
- WHAT?

00:05.667 --> 00:07.200
- RAY, COULD YOU GET UP
AND HELP ME, PLEASE?

00:07.233 --> 00:09.633
WE GOTTA SHAMPOO THE RUG
BEFORE THEY COME OVER TONIGHT.

00:09.667 --> 00:11.867
- SHAMPOO THE RUG?

00:11.900 --> 00:12.700
IT'S BERNIE AND LINDA.

00:12.733 --> 00:15.600
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA
SHAMPOO MYSELF.

00:15.633 --> 00:17.533
- WELL, WHEN THEY PASS OUT
FROM YOUR SMELL,

00:17.567 --> 00:20.967
I WANT THEM TO LAND
ON A CLEAN RUG, OKAY?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.067
COME ON, GET UP.
LET'S GO.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.133
- COME ON, I'M TIRED.

00:23.167 --> 00:24.400
I DROVE THE KIDS
TO ALL THEIR CRAP.

00:24.433 --> 00:26.233
I'D LIKE TO SIT DOWN
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

00:26.267 --> 00:28.633
- WELL, ME TOO.
COME ON!

00:28.667 --> 00:30.900
- OW! WHY DO YOU
ALWAYS DO THIS, HUH?

00:30.933 --> 00:32.233
EVERY TIME WE HAVE
PEOPLE OVER,

00:32.267 --> 00:35.167
WE SPEND ALL DAY
MAKING THE FAKE HOUSE.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.367
- IT'S NOT FAKE.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.667
IT'S THE WAY THE HOUSE
SHOULD BE ALL THE TIME.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.833
- YES, BUT IT ISN'T, SO ACTUALLY
IT'S LIKE LYING, HUH, RIGHT?

00:41.867 --> 00:44.933
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT,
LYING TO PEOPLE?

00:44.967 --> 00:47.833
- COULD YOU JUST START CLEARING
EVERYTHING OFF THE RUG, PLEASE?

00:47.867 --> 00:49.300
- I REALLY DON'T SEE THE NEED.

00:49.333 --> 00:52.200
- RAY, I SAID HELP ME!

00:52.233 --> 00:55.033
- I DON'T SEE THE NEED!

00:59.500 --> 01:02.500
- SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA SIT THERE
WHILE I DO ALL THE WORK?

01:02.533 --> 01:04.333
- I HAD THE KIDS
THE WHOLE MORNING!

01:04.367 --> 01:06.200
- BECAUSE I WAS CLEANING!

01:06.233 --> 01:09.000
- WELL, STOP IT ALREADY!

01:09.033 --> 01:12.300
- RAY, SERIOUSLY,
GET UP AND HELP ME.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.300
- NO.
- GET UP.

01:13.333 --> 01:14.567
- NO.
- RAY.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.533
- LISTEN, YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND?

01:16.567 --> 01:18.433
I WORK HARD ALL DAY.
I GOT A LOT OF STRESS.

01:18.467 --> 01:19.900
I COME HOME AND I'M--

01:19.933 --> 01:22.467
[turns on vacuum]

01:22.500 --> 01:24.333
[turns on TV]

01:27.667 --> 01:30.033
OH, YEAH!

01:31.133 --> 01:34.033
HA HA HA!

01:34.067 --> 01:36.200
YEAH!

02:03.500 --> 02:05.733
- WOW, DEBRA,
WHAT A MEAL.

02:05.767 --> 02:06.800
- YEAH,
GREAT DINNER, DEB.

02:06.833 --> 02:11.500
- LOUDER, SO THEY CAN
HEAR IT ACROSS THE STREET.

02:11.533 --> 02:13.233
- HOW ABOUT THAT RUG?
CLEAN, THOUGH, HUH?

02:13.267 --> 02:16.100
THAT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING.

02:16.133 --> 02:18.567
- WELL, IT'S GREAT
TO FINALLY SEE YOU GUYS.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.500
- YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

02:20.533 --> 02:21.867
- WE'RE STUCK AT HOME A LOT.

02:21.900 --> 02:25.400
BENJAMIN BURNS THROUGH
BABY SITTERS PRETTY QUICK.

02:25.433 --> 02:27.567
- YOU KNOW, HE'S JUST--
HE'S SPIRITED.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.633
- I'M AFRAID OF HIM.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.867
- OH, BERNIE,
DON'T EXAGGERATE.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.067
- I'M NOT EXAGGERATING.

02:41.533 --> 02:43.500
YOU SEE, YOU MINIMIZE
MY FEELINGS.

02:43.533 --> 02:45.600
THIS IS WHAT PAMELA
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.000
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.167
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

02:53.633 --> 02:54.900
- WHO'S PAMELA?

02:54.933 --> 02:56.900
- OH, OUR THERAPIST.

02:56.933 --> 02:58.233
- THERAPIST?

02:58.267 --> 03:00.567
WHAT, YOU MEAN LIKE
A MARRIAGE COUNSELOR?

03:00.600 --> 03:02.567
- YEAH, WE'VE BEEN GOING
FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.333
WE REALLY
HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

03:04.367 --> 03:07.033
WE WERE STARTING
TO FIGHT A LOT.

03:12.367 --> 03:13.567
- HUH.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.233
WHO WANTS COFFEE?

03:18.333 --> 03:20.267
- SO IS IT HELPING?

03:20.300 --> 03:22.167
- OH, YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.167
- REALLY?

03:23.200 --> 03:24.267
- FORGET THE COFFEE.

03:24.300 --> 03:27.700
HOW ABOUT SOME DRINKS,
PUT ON SOME MUSIC?

03:27.733 --> 03:29.333
- YOU KNOW, IT'S SO GREAT
TO BE ABLE

03:29.367 --> 03:31.233
TO TAKE OUR FIGHTS
TO A THIRD PARTY.

03:31.267 --> 03:32.767
- YEAH, NOW I'VE ACTUALLY
WON A FEW.

03:32.800 --> 03:33.600
[chuckles]

03:33.633 --> 03:36.267
OF COURSE,
IT'S NOT ABOUT WINNING.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.933
- PAMELA'S TRYING
TO HELP US UNDERSTAND

03:37.967 --> 03:40.867
THE DEEPER REASONS
WHY WE FIGHT.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.633
- THAT IS SO IMPORTANT,
BECAUSE--

03:42.667 --> 03:44.133
- WHOA! WHOOPS!

03:44.167 --> 03:45.267
DROPPED A CUP.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.367
IT'S MY FAVORITE,

03:46.400 --> 03:50.967
SO HOW ABOUT
A MOMENT OF SILENCE?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.633
- I'LL HELP YOU.

03:52.667 --> 03:57.067
- ANYWAY, I REALLY THINK
WE'RE COMMUNICATING BETTER.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.467
- OH, FOR SURE.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.600
NO, REALLY, BECAUSE I USED TO
TRY TO DISCUSS SOMETHING,

04:00.633 --> 04:01.967
AND THIS ONE
WOULD JUST SIT THERE

04:02.000 --> 04:05.433
IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER,
LIKE, "UHH...IT'S GLOWING."

04:05.467 --> 04:08.433
[laughter]

04:08.467 --> 04:10.667
- WELL, I GUESS THAT'S JUST
AN INSTINCTIVE RESPONSE

04:10.700 --> 04:13.267
TO THE YELLING.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.700
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
IF I AM YELLING,

04:14.733 --> 04:16.633
IT'S JUST PROBABLY 'CAUSE
I'VE ASKED HIM ALREADY

04:16.667 --> 04:20.167
TO TURN THE THING OFF
LIKE TEN TIMES.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.667
[both sigh]

04:23.467 --> 04:25.367
- SO PAMELA'S BEEN GREAT.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.567
- YEAH, IT'S REALLY GREAT.

04:33.700 --> 04:34.700
- I'M SORRY, HONEY.

04:34.733 --> 04:39.133
I WAS JUST BEING
KIND OF, UH, PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE.

04:43.900 --> 04:45.367
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I STARTED IT.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.767
I STARTED IT
WITH MY LITTLE HIDDEN AGENDA

04:47.800 --> 04:50.267
ABOUT THE COMPUTER AND...

05:00.600 --> 05:01.767
- WOW.

05:03.933 --> 05:06.433
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY WE STILL
HAVE A LITTLE WORK TO DO.

05:06.467 --> 05:08.367
- NO, BUT THE IMPORTANT THING
IS YOU'RE DOING IT.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.300
THAT'S FANTAS--
[vacuum cleaner running]

05:28.200 --> 05:32.433
- I DON'T WANT TO GO TO
COUNSELING!

05:32.467 --> 05:33.533
- WHAT?

05:33.567 --> 05:35.500
- I KNOW THAT AFTER WHAT
BERNIE AND LINDA SAID THAT--

05:35.533 --> 05:37.800
- YOU THINK I WANT US
TO GO TO COUNSELING?

05:37.833 --> 05:40.433
- WHAT?
YOU DON'T?

05:40.467 --> 05:44.067
- DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO
BECAUSE OF BERNIE AND LINDA?

05:47.333 --> 05:49.333
- WHAT?
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

05:49.367 --> 05:50.733
I JUST--I JUST THOUGHT,
YOU KNOW,

05:50.767 --> 05:52.733
'CAUSE THEY HAD THEIR
LITTLE THING TONIGHT

05:52.767 --> 05:55.533
AND AFTER THEY WERE ALL
HUGGY AND KISSY...

05:55.567 --> 06:01.133
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
THEY'RE DIFFERENT FROM US.

06:01.167 --> 06:03.833
THEIR FIGHT
WAS ABOUT THE COMPUTER.

06:03.867 --> 06:07.567
OURS WAS ABOUT THE TV.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.933
AND THE TV
HAS BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS.

06:11.967 --> 06:14.367
SO THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.900
- WE'RE GOING TO COUNSELING.

06:16.933 --> 06:18.100
- NO!

06:18.133 --> 06:20.767
- I ALREADY GOT PAMELA'S NUMBER
FROM LINDA.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.433
- I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO COUNSELING!

06:22.467 --> 06:24.767
- RAY, WE FIGHT ALL THE TIME.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.900
- NO, NOT FIGHTS.

06:25.933 --> 06:27.900
TIFFS, LITTLE TIFFS.

06:27.933 --> 06:30.633
SWEETIE PIE, BABY...

06:30.667 --> 06:32.200
SKINNY GIRL!

06:32.233 --> 06:34.967
COME ON.
NO, NO COUNSELING.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.767
- WHAT WOULD BE
SO TERRIBLE ABOUT IT?

06:36.800 --> 06:37.900
- EVERYTHING.

06:37.933 --> 06:40.067
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
GONNA HAPPEN, WE'RE GONNA GO,

06:40.100 --> 06:41.567
AND THE NEXT DAY
WE'RE GONNA GROW WINGS

06:41.600 --> 06:44.633
AND FLY AROUND GIVING
EACH OTHER FOOT MASSAGES?

06:44.667 --> 06:46.933
- IT'S JUST GETTING
A LITTLE HELP.

06:46.967 --> 06:48.067
- WE DON'T NEED HELP.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.167
- WHY DON'T WE LET PAMELA
DECIDE THAT?

06:50.200 --> 06:51.667
- OH, YEAH,
AND THEN THERE'S THAT.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.100
HMM...PAMELA...

06:53.133 --> 06:56.133
WONDER WHOSE SIDE
SHE'S GONNA BE ON?

06:56.167 --> 06:58.000
- OKAY, SO WE CAN GO TO A MAN.

06:58.033 --> 06:59.600
- OH, YEAH.
YEAH, RIGHT.

06:59.633 --> 07:04.233
"OH, YOU UNDERSTAND ME
SO MUCH BETTER THAN MY HUSBAND."

07:07.533 --> 07:10.567
- AND YOU DON'T NEED THERAPY.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.267
- LOOK, ALL THESE
THERAPIST PEOPLE WANT TO DO

07:12.300 --> 07:13.533
IS GET YOU TO CRY.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.800
- DON'T YOU WANT TO FIND
THE DEEPER REASONS

07:15.833 --> 07:17.200
WHY WE FIGHT?

07:17.233 --> 07:19.100
DON'T YOU WANT TO HAVE
A HEALTHIER MARRIAGE?

07:19.133 --> 07:20.333
- NOT IF I HAVE TO CRY.

07:20.367 --> 07:21.667
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT!

07:21.700 --> 07:23.533
IT'S ABOUT
TRYING TO BE HAPPY.

07:23.567 --> 07:25.700
- BUT WE ARE HAPPY!
LOOK AT US.

07:25.733 --> 07:27.133
I LOVE YOU.

07:27.167 --> 07:31.433
- GET OFF OF ME.
GET! GET OFF OF ME.

07:31.467 --> 07:34.467
LISTEN, I AM MAKING
AN APPOINTMENT FOR COUNSELING,

07:34.500 --> 07:35.567
AND YOU ARE COMING WITH ME,

07:35.600 --> 07:37.600
BECAUSE WE ARE GONNA DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

07:37.633 --> 07:41.000
TO HEAL THIS MARRIAGE.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.433
- STUPID MARRIAGE.

07:51.333 --> 07:52.433
- SO, RAY AND DEBRA,

07:52.467 --> 07:53.933
HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN MARRIED?

07:53.967 --> 07:56.167
- THIRTEEN YEARS.

07:56.200 --> 08:00.767
- TRUE.
SEE? NO ARGUMENT THERE.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.467
- AND JUST GENERALLY SPEAKING,

08:02.500 --> 08:04.833
WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
TO COME HERE TODAY?

08:04.867 --> 08:11.433
- UM, WELL, THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT'S LONG OVERDUE.

08:11.467 --> 08:13.067
- OKAY.

08:14.867 --> 08:17.767
WELL, THEN, DEBRA,
WHY DON'T YOU START?

08:17.800 --> 08:19.833
- OKAY.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.200
UM...

08:22.233 --> 08:27.200
WELL, I JUST FEEL
THAT I WORK VERY HARD

08:27.233 --> 08:30.200
TO KEEP THE HOUSE
UP AND RUNNING,

08:30.233 --> 08:32.600
AND I GUESS I FEEL,
YOU KNOW,

08:32.633 --> 08:38.533
KIND OF UNAPPRECIATED
BECAUSE...

08:39.900 --> 08:42.100
[squeaks]

08:42.133 --> 08:45.900
I JUST...

08:45.933 --> 08:47.100
- HERE YOU GO.

08:47.133 --> 08:48.567
- THANK YOU.

08:51.367 --> 08:54.400
- RAY, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
WHAT DEBRA'S EXPRESSING?

09:00.500 --> 09:02.633
- UH...

09:02.667 --> 09:04.767
I'M SORRY.

09:06.833 --> 09:08.633
- OKAY.

09:08.667 --> 09:10.800
ANYTHING ELSE?

09:10.833 --> 09:11.800
RAY?

09:11.833 --> 09:15.933
- OH, STILL ME?
OKAY.

09:15.967 --> 09:19.100
WELL, UH...

09:19.133 --> 09:22.200
YOU KNOW,
I JUST WANT TO SAY

09:22.233 --> 09:24.500
THAT, I MEAN,
I WORK HARD TOO.

09:24.533 --> 09:27.000
AND, YOU KNOW,
I COME HOME AND I'M TIRED,

09:27.033 --> 09:29.433
AND I JUST...

09:29.467 --> 09:31.533
I JUST...

09:41.633 --> 09:44.133
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO CRY LIKE THAT.

09:47.333 --> 09:49.033
- PAMELA, COULD I JUST
SAY SOMETHING?

09:49.067 --> 09:50.133
- SURE.

09:50.167 --> 09:51.400
- JUST AS AN EXAMPLE,

09:51.433 --> 09:55.333
LAST WEEK, RAY CAME HOME LATE
FROM GOLFING.

09:55.367 --> 09:58.233
AND I GUESS GOLF IS KIND OF
A HOT-BUTTON ISSUE WITH ME,

09:58.267 --> 10:00.400
AND WE HAD A FIGHT.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.000
- RAY, DO YOU REMEMBER THIS?

10:02.033 --> 10:04.467
- I DO.
I SHOT A 94.

10:10.233 --> 10:12.100
- GO AHEAD, DEBRA.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.933
- I HAD ALL THE KIDS,

10:13.967 --> 10:15.567
AND I WAS EXPECTING HIM
HOME AT 2:00,

10:15.600 --> 10:17.800
AND HE DIDN'T SHOW UP
UNTIL 5:00.

10:17.833 --> 10:20.267
AND HIS EXPLANATION
FOR WHY IT TOOK SO LONG

10:20.300 --> 10:25.200
WAS THAT HIS FRIEND GIANNI
WANTED TO PET A DEER.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.367
AND THAT'S JUST INDICATIVE

10:26.400 --> 10:28.600
OF THE KIND OF THING
THAT RAY ALWAYS DOES.

10:28.633 --> 10:31.400
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT
WE NEED TIME TO OURSELVES,

10:31.433 --> 10:34.300
BUT WHAT REALLY BOTHERS ME
IS THAT HE DOESN'T SEEM

10:34.333 --> 10:38.267
TO WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ANYTHING.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.600
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.300
- RAY?

10:53.633 --> 10:55.533
- SHE'S RIGHT.

10:55.567 --> 10:56.500
- WHAT?

10:56.533 --> 10:59.667
- SHE'S TOTALLY RIGHT
BECAUSE, WELL...

10:59.700 --> 11:02.933
I'VE BEEN TERRIBLY
INSENSITIVE WITH MY GOLF.

11:02.967 --> 11:05.067
I THINK I USE GOLF

11:05.100 --> 11:08.267
IN A ALMOST
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE WAY.

11:14.733 --> 11:15.667
- OKAY.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.367
- BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

11:18.400 --> 11:21.533
I KNOW IT'S A PROBLEM,
I KNOW I HAVE TO CHANGE,

11:21.567 --> 11:23.467
BUT THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW,

11:23.500 --> 11:27.267
I'M BACK
ON THE COURSE AGAIN.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.800
- BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU ARE WILLING

11:28.833 --> 11:34.300
TO LOOK AT YOUR BEHAVIOR,
WHICH IS A VERY GOOD START.

11:36.533 --> 11:37.667
- WAIT. WHAT?

11:37.700 --> 11:40.100
- BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,
IT'S MORE THAN JUST THE GOLF.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.933
DEBRA IS LIKE A SAINT.

11:41.967 --> 11:45.000
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THE THINGS
SHE HAS TO PUT UP WITH.

11:45.033 --> 11:47.933
ONCE, I ACTUALLY TAPED
A FOOTBALL GAME

11:47.967 --> 11:49.700
OVER OUR WEDDING VIDEO.

11:49.733 --> 11:51.900
- PAMELA, CAN I JUST--

11:51.933 --> 11:55.367
- WAIT, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
LET'S LET RAY GET THIS OUT.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.533
- IT'S PROBABLY THE WORST THING
A HUSBAND CAN DO, RIGHT?

11:57.567 --> 11:59.167
ALL I COULD THINK OF
TO FIX IT

11:59.200 --> 12:01.833
WAS TO ARRANGE TO HAVE
OUR WEDDING VOWS RENEWED.

12:01.867 --> 12:03.533
- THAT'S NICE.

12:03.567 --> 12:05.200
- I GUESS.

12:08.633 --> 12:11.000
ACTUALLY, I THINK
THE WHOLE THING ENDED

12:11.033 --> 12:12.267
WITH US MAKING LOVE.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.467
- PAMELA, I THINK WE'RE GETTING
A LITTLE OFF TRACK HERE.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.067
I MEAN, THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
THE RAY I GET AT HOME, YOU KNOW?

12:18.100 --> 12:20.367
RIGHT NOW HE'S THE ONE
BEING A SAINT.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.400
- WELL, LET'S TRY
TO HAVE THE PERSPECTIVE

12:22.433 --> 12:25.100
THAT NEITHER ONE OF US
IS A SAINT, OKAY?

12:25.133 --> 12:27.400
- YEAH, OKAY, SURE.

12:29.700 --> 12:32.267
- I'M SORRY THAT
I CALLED HER A SAINT BEFORE.

12:34.533 --> 12:36.833
STUPID!

12:36.867 --> 12:39.867
- IT'S OKAY, RAYMOND.
NO, YOU'RE DOING JUST FINE.

12:39.900 --> 12:44.133
OKAY, NOW, YOU TWO OBVIOUSLY
HAVE ISSUES TO RESOLVE,

12:44.167 --> 12:45.533
BUT ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND

12:45.567 --> 12:48.200
IS THAT HAVING
OCCASIONAL ARGUMENTS IS NORMAL,

12:48.233 --> 12:49.733
AND IT'S EVEN HEALTHY.

12:49.767 --> 12:52.333
SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS, WE'LL TRY
TO FIND OUT THE DEEPER REASONS

12:52.367 --> 12:56.200
WHY YOU ARGUE SO THAT
WE CAN BEGIN TO CHANGE ANY--

12:56.233 --> 13:01.300
ANY PARTICULARLY
HARMFUL BEHAVIOR.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.400
- [sighs]

13:10.000 --> 13:13.367
- AND ONE THING THAT
YOU'VE GOT GOING FOR YOU HERE

13:13.400 --> 13:15.033
IS AN ATTITUDE OF COOPERATION.

13:15.067 --> 13:17.900
BELIEVE ME, SOME PARTNERS
HAVE TO BE DRAGGED INTO THIS

13:17.933 --> 13:19.367
KICKING AND SCREAMING.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.533
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.333
- PAMELA, I'M GONNA DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

13:22.367 --> 13:25.100
TO HEAL THIS MARRIAGE.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.567
[TV playing]

13:39.600 --> 13:43.167
- OH, MY GOD. WHAT DID SHE SAY?
IS THERE HOPE?

13:45.400 --> 13:47.767
- I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD HAVE
SAID WE WENT TO A MOVIE.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.233
- COUNSELING, HUH?

13:49.267 --> 13:52.433
I CAME OVER
AS SOON AS I HEARD.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.967
- SO, MARIE,
ARE THE KIDS ASLEEP?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.567
- YES, AND I'M GONNA DO MY BEST

13:57.600 --> 14:00.700
TO MAKE SURE
THEY REMAIN UNTRAUMATIZED.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.600
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TWO
WENT TO A SHRINK.

14:04.633 --> 14:07.733
HE'S THE ONE
WITH THE PROBLEMS.

14:07.767 --> 14:10.000
- LET'S KEEP THIS
ON RAYMOND, SHALL WE?

14:10.033 --> 14:11.633
PERSONALLY, DEB,
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME

14:11.667 --> 14:13.333
THAT A NEUTRAL PARTY
BE BROUGHT IN

14:13.367 --> 14:16.367
TO SET HIM STRAIGHT
ON JUST HOW GREAT HE'S GOT IT.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.833
- WELL,
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED,

14:17.867 --> 14:19.100
BECAUSE THE RAYMOND WE ALL KNOW

14:19.133 --> 14:21.100
DISAPPEARED AS SOON
AS WE GOT THERE.

14:21.133 --> 14:23.167
- WHAT, WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:23.200 --> 14:24.733
- OH, YOU WERE OPEN
AND CONSIDERATE

14:24.767 --> 14:26.600
AND WILLING TO LOOK
AT YOUR OWN FAULTS.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.333
YOU MADE ME SICK!

14:31.233 --> 14:32.900
- EXCUSE ME, BUT I SPENT
THE WHOLE TIME

14:32.933 --> 14:34.000
SAYING "I'M SORRY."

14:34.033 --> 14:35.167
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

14:35.200 --> 14:38.233
- OH, YOU ARE SO FULL OF IT.

14:38.267 --> 14:41.600
- DO YOU MIND?

14:41.633 --> 14:42.567
LISTEN.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.333
- YOU MANIPULATED
THE WHOLE THING.

14:44.367 --> 14:46.067
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS

14:46.100 --> 14:47.733
IF YOU GO IN THERE
PLAYING A CHARACTER?

14:47.767 --> 14:49.233
- YOU'RE JUST MAD BECAUSE
YOU WANTED ME

14:49.267 --> 14:50.867
TO GET BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING,
AND PAMELA LIKED ME.

14:50.900 --> 14:53.433
- SHE DIDN'T LIKE YOU,
'CAUSE YOU WEREN'T THERE!

14:53.467 --> 14:56.700
- WHAT ARE YOU HIDING, MAN?
WHAT'S IN THERE?

14:56.733 --> 14:59.167
- SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE YOU DID GOOD, RAY.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.700
NAME, RANK, AND SERIAL NUMBER.

15:01.733 --> 15:06.767
NEVER OPEN UP.
KEEP THE ENEMY IN THE DARK.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.067
- YOU'RE AN IGNORAMUS.

15:13.633 --> 15:18.100
IF ANYBODY EVER OPENED YOU UP,
ALL THEY'D FIND IS MEAT.

15:23.433 --> 15:26.600
- NO SON OF MINE
NEEDS COUNSELING,

15:26.633 --> 15:28.533
EXCEPT THE BIG ONE.

15:35.233 --> 15:37.533
- YOU DIDN'T GO IN THERE TO FIND
OUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH US.

15:37.567 --> 15:39.200
YOU WENT IN THERE TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

15:39.233 --> 15:41.567
YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF
'CAUSE I'M NOT GOING BACK.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.033
- OH, YES, YOU ARE.
- NO, NO WAY.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.900
YOU HEARD HER YOURSELF.
SHE SAID WE WERE NORMAL.

15:44.933 --> 15:48.033
- SHE DIDN'T SAY THAT.
WHAT ROOM WERE YOU IN?

15:48.067 --> 15:49.200
- HEY, INSTEAD OF YELLING AT ME,

15:49.233 --> 15:51.200
SHOULDN'T YOU BE WORRIED
ABOUT THE DEEPER REASONS

15:51.233 --> 15:52.667
BEHIND HOW YOU'RE REACTING?

15:52.700 --> 15:54.733
- I THINK YOU BETTER WORRY
ABOUT HOW I'M REACTING.

15:54.767 --> 15:56.500
- HARMFUL BEHAVIOR!
HARMFUL BEHAVIOR!

15:56.533 --> 15:58.400
- YOU'RE JUST A BIG PHONY,
AND YOU KNOW IT!

15:58.433 --> 16:00.067
- OH, I WISH PAMELA
COULD SEE YOU NOW!

16:00.100 --> 16:01.700
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

16:01.733 --> 16:03.200
[Debra and Raymond yelling]

16:03.233 --> 16:06.767
- ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, STOP IT, YOU TWO.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.700
- I GOTTA SAY,

16:08.733 --> 16:11.467
THE COUNSELING DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE WORKING.

16:13.667 --> 16:16.967
- NOW, I WANT YOU TO SIT DOWN,
AND LET'S TRY TO TALK THIS OUT.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.500
- MARIE, I AM NOT
SITTING DOWN--

16:18.533 --> 16:19.433
- PLEASE, DEBRA.

16:19.467 --> 16:21.600
I MAY NOT BE
A CERTIFIED THERAPIST,

16:21.633 --> 16:26.367
BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD
BY MANY PEOPLE THAT I COULD BE.

16:32.467 --> 16:33.533
- THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY MEAN

16:33.567 --> 16:37.167
WHEN THEY SAY
YOU'RE CERTIFIABLE.

16:39.033 --> 16:40.300
- I HAPPEN TO BE VERY GOOD

16:40.333 --> 16:42.533
AT THINGS
RELATING TO FEELINGS.

16:42.567 --> 16:45.533
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR 45 YEARS,

16:45.567 --> 16:47.267
AND IF THERE'S
ONE THING I UNDERSTAND,

16:47.300 --> 16:51.067
IT'S HOW AWFUL
A HUSBAND CAN BE.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.467
- OKAY.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.400
- RAYMOND.

16:54.433 --> 16:57.100
- NO, NO,
YOU'RE ON HER SIDE.

16:57.133 --> 16:58.500
LISTEN, BERNIE AND LINDA
CAME IN

16:58.533 --> 17:00.200
AND THEY SAID
THEY WENT TO COUNSELING,

17:00.233 --> 17:02.000
AND SHE GOT IT IN HER HEAD
THAT WE SHOULD GO,

17:02.033 --> 17:03.833
AND WE DON'T NEED TO.

17:03.867 --> 17:05.500
- OH, POOR RAYMOND.

17:05.533 --> 17:09.600
NEVER LEARNED HOW TO GET ALONG
WITH OTHER HUMAN BEINGS.

17:09.633 --> 17:10.500
- BE QUIET, ROBBIE.

17:10.533 --> 17:12.000
- YEAH, SHUT UP.
- NO, YOU SHUT UP.

17:12.033 --> 17:14.067
- ASS.
- ASS!

17:16.033 --> 17:17.633
- QUIET!

17:27.333 --> 17:30.133
DEBRA, DID YOU WANT
TO GO TO COUNSELING

17:30.167 --> 17:31.300
BECAUSE OF BERNIE AND LINDA?

17:31.333 --> 17:33.367
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I MEAN, LOOK AT HOW WE FIGHT.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.833
THE VERY MORNING THEY
CAME OVER, WE WERE FIGHTING.

17:36.867 --> 17:38.567
- AND WHAT DO YOU FIGHT ABOUT?

17:38.600 --> 17:41.533
- ABOUT HOW NUTS SHE GOES
CLEANING WHEN PEOPLE COME OVER.

17:41.567 --> 17:44.167
ALL I WANT TO DO IS RELAX
FOR ONCE AND WATCH A LITTLE TV,

17:44.200 --> 17:47.767
AND SHE ASKED ME
TO SHAMPOO THE RUG.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.167
- WHAT?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.733
YOU CAN'T HELP OUT A LITTLE?

17:54.967 --> 17:57.700
- WHAT?
YOU DON'T HELP OUT.

17:57.733 --> 17:59.333
- ASS.

18:02.067 --> 18:03.200
- YES.

18:03.233 --> 18:04.267
- JUST TO BE CLEAR,

18:04.300 --> 18:05.767
WHEN I WANT MY HOME
TO LOOK NICE,

18:05.800 --> 18:08.000
IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG
WITH ASKING RAY TO HELP ME?

18:08.033 --> 18:09.733
- THAT'S CERTAINLY VALID.

18:09.767 --> 18:11.733
AND, RAYMOND,
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW

18:11.767 --> 18:13.733
THAT IF YOU WANT YOUR HOUSE
TO LOOK NICE,

18:13.767 --> 18:16.267
DEBRA NEEDS HELP.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.233
- LISTEN, CAN'T I SOMETIMES
WATCH A LITTLE TV?

18:23.267 --> 18:24.767
I MEAN, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

18:24.800 --> 18:26.000
- ALSO VALID.

18:26.033 --> 18:28.933
AND, DEBRA, IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO KEEP IN MIND

18:28.967 --> 18:30.933
THAT RAYMOND
IS A VERY HARD WORKER

18:30.967 --> 18:32.567
AND SOMETIMES
NEEDS TO RELAX.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.300
- OF COURSE,
BUT WHY IS IT SUCH A BATTLE

18:35.333 --> 18:37.233
TO GET YOU TO DO ANYTHING?

18:37.267 --> 18:38.733
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:40.233 --> 18:41.833
- THAT'S WHY I WANT
TO GO TO COUNSELING.

18:41.867 --> 18:44.567
I DON'T THINK IT'S
THAT YOU'RE JUST LAZY.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.167
I THINK THERE'S
A DEEPER REASON BEHIND THIS,

18:47.200 --> 18:48.500
AND IF WE COULD
JUST FIGURE IT OUT,

18:48.533 --> 18:49.633
YOU AND I
COULD BE HAPPIER.

18:49.667 --> 18:52.000
- COME ON, YOU KNOW ME.
THERE'S NOT MUCH DEEPNESS.

18:52.033 --> 18:53.733
I JUST--I LIKE
TO BE TAKEN CARE OF.

18:53.767 --> 18:56.767
- BUT YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND, RAY,
THAT THAT'S NOT A WIFE;

18:56.800 --> 18:58.067
THAT'S A MOTHER.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.633
- WELL,
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

19:11.167 --> 19:14.167
- HOLY CRAP!

19:20.467 --> 19:22.267
- NO, NO,
ON THE CONTRARY, DAD,

19:22.300 --> 19:26.133
I THINK WE'VE MADE
QUITE A BREAKTHROUGH.

19:26.167 --> 19:27.567
- NO. NO, NO.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.433
- OH, NO, NO,
IT'S VERY SIMPLE, REALLY.

19:30.467 --> 19:32.767
YOU SEE, APPARENTLY
THE DEEP REASONS

19:32.800 --> 19:34.033
BEHIND THE FIGHTS

19:34.067 --> 19:37.133
IS THAT YOU WISHED
YOU MARRIED YOUR MOTHER.

19:37.167 --> 19:38.433
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

19:38.467 --> 19:40.367
- YES, YOU DID.

19:41.667 --> 19:44.467
- WHY WOULD I SAY THAT?

19:51.267 --> 19:53.200
- RAYMOND, RAYMOND,

19:53.233 --> 19:56.267
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
IN WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.867
- PLEASE STOP, MA!
STOP!

19:58.900 --> 20:02.267
LISTEN, THAT'S--
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT TO SAY.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.700
DEBRA, COULD YOU CALL PAMELA

20:03.733 --> 20:07.100
AND SEE IF SHE HAS
AN OPENING FOR RIGHT NOW?

20:07.133 --> 20:09.333
- MAYBE SHE COULD MOVE IN.

20:09.367 --> 20:12.167
- I THINK IT'S GETTING
KIND OF LATE, EVERYBODY.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.567
RAY, YOU WANT TO GO UP?

20:13.600 --> 20:15.967
- WE SHOULD--
WE SHOULD CALL PAMELA, RIGHT?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.800
- UH, NO, I THINK SOME THINGS
ARE BETTER LEFT UNEXPLORED.

20:18.833 --> 20:20.667
- BECAUSE I'M SICK.
THAT'S SICK WHAT I SAID.

20:20.700 --> 20:22.600
- NO, NO.
I THINK YOU ARE JUST LAZY.

20:22.633 --> 20:25.433
- YOU THINK SO? THAT'S IT.
YEAH, I'M A LAZY GUY.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.533
- SWEET DREAMS.

20:28.567 --> 20:31.700
YOU WANT MOMMY
TO TUCK YOU IN?

20:40.600 --> 20:41.367
- HEY.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.767
- HEY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

20:43.800 --> 20:45.067
- AH, NOTHING.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.500
I WAS JUST
FEELING A LITTLE GUILTY

20:46.533 --> 20:49.300
OVER MY LAUGHING
AT YOUR PREDICAMENT YESTERDAY.

20:49.333 --> 20:50.400
- WELL, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

20:50.433 --> 20:51.900
I MEAN,
DEBRA AND I TALKED IT OUT.

20:51.933 --> 20:53.633
WE'RE FINE NOW.

20:53.667 --> 20:54.767
- THAT'S GOOD.

20:54.800 --> 20:55.700
- THAT'S GOOD, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT,

20:55.733 --> 20:57.667
AND THE TRUTH IS,
IT'S GOOD THAT YOU GUYS

20:57.700 --> 20:59.333
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT YOU
HAD A PROBLEM

20:59.367 --> 21:01.967
AND YOU TOOK THE RIGHT STEPS
TO DEAL WITH IT.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.467
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT
WHEN I WAS MARRIED, HUH?

21:04.500 --> 21:06.033
- HMM.

21:06.067 --> 21:08.900
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THANKS.
THANKS, MAN.

21:08.933 --> 21:10.900
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I KNOW YOU'RE FEELING BAD,

21:10.933 --> 21:13.167
SO I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

21:29.900 --> 21:32.533
ENJOY, YOU SICK BASTARD.
