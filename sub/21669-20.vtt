WEBVTT

00:00.496 --> 00:02.509
This year,
the competition began

00:02.510 --> 00:04.729
with the announcement
of the most personal prize...

00:04.730 --> 00:06.864
I'm looking for my head chef

00:06.865 --> 00:10.067
at Gordon Ramsay Steak
at the Paris

00:10.068 --> 00:11.535
in Las Vegas.

00:11.536 --> 00:13.004
<i>In Hell's Kitchen history.</i>

00:13.005 --> 00:14.538
Who doesn't want that?

00:14.539 --> 00:16.741
With such a
coveted job on the line...

00:16.742 --> 00:18.809
. I will do whatever it takes.
I'm going all the way.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.578
Chef Ramsay designed
a diverse set of challenges.

00:20.579 --> 00:22.647
Now.
Ow.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.115
Let's go.

00:27.185 --> 00:28.719
Who wants it?

00:28.720 --> 00:30.254
Come on, Barbie.

00:33.458 --> 00:35.326
♪ Grits ♪
Yes.

00:35.327 --> 00:38.162
I've never made grits.
I don't know how to make them.

00:38.163 --> 00:41.732
And the women
dominated early on.

00:41.733 --> 00:43.701
Let's go.
Thank you.

00:43.702 --> 00:45.469
The red team won
the first three challenges...

00:45.470 --> 00:46.337
The women.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.406
Well done.
Ladies, congratulations.

00:48.407 --> 00:50.374
Congratulations, ladies.
Well done.

00:50.375 --> 00:51.976
Girls rule.
Boys drool.

00:51.977 --> 00:53.844
Reaping amazing awards.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.947
Ladies, jump aboard your G4.

00:55.948 --> 00:58.983
And enjoying superior
dinner services as well.

00:58.984 --> 01:00.418
Robyn!
Yeah, chef.

01:00.419 --> 01:01.652
That's perfectly cooked,
the beef.

01:01.653 --> 01:02.753
Thank you, chef.
Scallops.

01:02.754 --> 01:04.622
Yes!
Christina.

01:04.623 --> 01:06.857
<i>Tastes delicious.
Red team nailed it.</i>

01:06.858 --> 01:08.259
But while
they had early success

01:08.260 --> 01:10.594
in the kitchen, trouble
was brewing in the dorms...

01:10.595 --> 01:13.230
You
get that ?

01:13.231 --> 01:15.132
As two different factions form.

01:15.133 --> 01:17.168
There's, like, two alliances
right now.

01:17.169 --> 01:19.170
Me, Dani, and Christina.

01:19.171 --> 01:21.072
And then Tiffany, Kimmie,
and Robyn.

01:21.073 --> 01:24.175
And then there was Barbie...

01:24.176 --> 01:25.743
You want
to get choked out?

01:25.744 --> 01:27.144
You want
to get choked out?

01:27.145 --> 01:28.412
Who was outcast by all...

01:28.413 --> 01:30.948
Nobody wants
your bitch ass here.

01:30.949 --> 01:32.750
Until Robyn's outbursts...

01:32.751 --> 01:34.018
Stop .

01:34.019 --> 01:35.353
Earned her the title...

01:35.354 --> 01:36.554
Hit me.
Hit me.

01:36.555 --> 01:37.888
Of the most despised.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.724
Stupid, dumb bitch.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.959
The blue team
charted a different course.

01:43.762 --> 01:45.196
They may have had
fewer screaming matches.

01:45.197 --> 01:46.430
Go, go, go.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.266
Keep it going.

01:49.267 --> 01:50.768
But they also had fewer wins.

01:50.769 --> 01:53.204
Oh, my God.
Are you stupid?

01:53.205 --> 01:55.006
Both of you,
off out of here.

01:55.007 --> 01:56.707
Muppets!
They had problems

01:56.708 --> 01:59.410
in the challenges...
Start again.

01:59.411 --> 02:01.312
It's raw.
This is despicable.

02:01.313 --> 02:02.613
And in the dinner services.

02:03.949 --> 02:05.783
Get out.
Get out. Get out.

02:05.784 --> 02:07.785
And one more thing, get out!

02:07.786 --> 02:09.720
When chef Ramsay
changed up the teams...

02:09.721 --> 02:11.255
Robyn, join the blue team.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.024
I'm not gonna be
the weakest link.

02:13.025 --> 02:14.125
The blue team
had a bit of success.

02:14.126 --> 02:15.893
Blue team.

02:15.894 --> 02:17.828
I belong on the blue team.

02:17.829 --> 02:20.064
But they also
had a lot more drama.

02:20.065 --> 02:21.999
Who told her to put
all the garnish in the oven?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.801
You guys all did.
Do not sandbag me like this.

02:23.802 --> 02:26.837
What, we did not?
I didn't tell her that.

02:26.838 --> 02:31.108
Even though this group of
chefs had their share of problems,

02:31.109 --> 02:34.578
never before have we seen
a group fight so hard to stay.

02:34.579 --> 02:37.081
I come in here
with 250 percent.

02:37.082 --> 02:39.050
Barbie's the weakest person
in this kitchen.

02:39.051 --> 02:40.718
<i>She can't run a station
by herself.</i>

02:40.719 --> 02:42.153
I still put out better food
than everybody standing there.

02:42.154 --> 02:44.221
You gonna tell me
I deserve to go home?

02:44.222 --> 02:46.524
In the end, chef
Ramsay had a worthy final three...

02:46.525 --> 02:48.926
Justin, Dana, and Christina.

02:48.927 --> 02:50.394
This is where it gets
really hard.

02:50.395 --> 02:52.563
<i>There can only be two.</i>

02:52.564 --> 02:54.498
And after having
a difficult time deciding,

02:54.499 --> 02:55.299
he chose...
Christina.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.734
Whoa.
And...

02:56.735 --> 02:57.902
Justin.
As the ones

02:57.903 --> 02:59.570
he wanted to see battle
in the finale

02:59.571 --> 03:01.172
to determine
who will be his head chef

03:01.173 --> 03:03.007
at Gordon Ramsay Steak.

03:03.008 --> 03:05.643
Tonight, there will be
no excuses.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.745
I need this food.
I need it right now.

03:07.746 --> 03:09.480
Push.
Push, push, push.

03:09.481 --> 03:11.348
And no place to hide.

03:11.349 --> 03:13.617
Will it be Christina...
Did it drop?

03:13.618 --> 03:16.153
The 32-year-old chef
de cuisine from Philadelphia...

03:16.154 --> 03:18.456
1 minute and a half.
Okay.

03:18.457 --> 03:20.758
Who emerged early on
in the signature dish challenge...

03:20.759 --> 03:22.726
Beautiful.
Pork's cooked perfect.

03:22.727 --> 03:25.029
And impressed
everyone by being the only one

03:25.030 --> 03:28.265
to earn three stars in
the cooking reflexes challenge?

03:28.266 --> 03:29.433
Yay!

03:29.434 --> 03:31.769
Christina, great job.
Thank you, chef.

03:31.770 --> 03:33.471
Recognized as a dominating
force by her competitors...

03:33.472 --> 03:35.773
Christina is very strong.

03:35.774 --> 03:37.241
And chef Ramsay.

03:37.242 --> 03:38.776
Christina, it tastes delicious.

03:38.777 --> 03:40.878
Thank you, chef.
Christina, next service,

03:40.879 --> 03:42.413
that dish is going on.
Yeah?

03:42.414 --> 03:44.215
<i>Well done.
Wow.</i>

03:44.216 --> 03:46.050
Christina emerged
as a clear leader...

03:46.051 --> 03:47.218
Stop! Follow me
with that sauce, Royce.

03:47.219 --> 03:49.019
Barbie, how long do you need?
Two minutes.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.454
Dana, I'll see you
in 2 1/2 minutes.

03:50.455 --> 03:52.690
Finally, a voice
on the hot plate.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.458
Demanding excellence
from her teammates...

03:54.459 --> 03:55.826
Where's that cod, Dana?
I need it walking.

03:55.827 --> 03:57.628
And herself.
There's no way that's spinach.

03:57.629 --> 03:59.697
<i>Come on, man.
Let's go.</i>

03:59.698 --> 04:01.899
<i>Or will Hell's
Kitchen next winner be Justin,</i>

04:01.900 --> 04:04.001
the 29-year-old sous chef
from new Jersey...

04:04.002 --> 04:05.769
Let's go!
Who secured his place

04:05.770 --> 04:07.671
in the finals...
Justin.

04:07.672 --> 04:09.773
On the strength
of his creativity...

04:09.774 --> 04:11.842
<i>Justin, ravioli, dangerous.</i>

04:11.843 --> 04:13.611
Yes, very dangerous, chef.
It's pretty good.

04:13.612 --> 04:14.578
Yeah, very impressed with it.

04:14.579 --> 04:15.846
Good start.
Thank you very much.

04:15.847 --> 04:17.581
And his excellent palate?

04:17.582 --> 04:19.350
Congratulations, blue team.

04:19.351 --> 04:21.519
Justin, that's the best dish
I've tasted so far.

04:21.519 --> 04:24.388
<i>After Justin made
Hell's Kitchen history...</i>

04:24.389 --> 04:26.323
Scallop, sunchoke,
radish, fig, chef.

04:26.324 --> 04:28.125
<i>Yeah!
Never before</i>

04:28.126 --> 04:29.660
<i>has anyone gotten
a perfect score.</i>

04:29.661 --> 04:31.729
You have
an extraordinary palate.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.731
His confidence
was on the rise.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.466
And he took complete control
of his team.

04:35.467 --> 04:37.134
I don't need anybody else
to talk but me

04:37.135 --> 04:38.602
<i>and Brian right now.
Royce.</i>

04:38.603 --> 04:40.704
Get that meat done.
We're following right away

04:40.705 --> 04:42.706
<i>with the entree.
And emerged as the best chef</i>

04:42.707 --> 04:44.074
in the blue kitchen.
Get off my station, please.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.609
Get off my station, please.

04:45.610 --> 04:47.678
There's no stopping me
at this point.

04:47.679 --> 04:49.213
And so tonight

04:49.214 --> 04:50.714
it's a dream matchup.
Oh, my God.

04:50.715 --> 04:52.283
It's the best of the blue

04:52.284 --> 04:53.851
versus the best of the red,

04:53.852 --> 04:56.720
as two determined chefs
fight it out

04:56.721 --> 04:59.590
to become Gordon Ramsay's
next head chef...

04:59.591 --> 05:00.891
Push.
Let's go.

05:00.892 --> 05:02.593
We're almost there.
Come on.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.228
<i>And the winner
of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

05:04.229 --> 05:05.362
It's got to be my way.

05:05.363 --> 05:06.697
You are literally
breaking down.

05:06.698 --> 05:08.199
Get that together.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.235
Push like you've
never pushed before.

on Hell's Kitchen, Christina...</i>

06:07.158 --> 06:09.460
We're gonna have scallop
with risotto.

06:09.461 --> 06:11.395
And Justin...

06:11.396 --> 06:13.297
<i>The first fish...
sauteed dover sole.</i>

06:13.298 --> 06:14.265
What?
Race to get their teams

06:14.266 --> 06:16.267
up to speed on their menus.

06:16.268 --> 06:18.402
<i>Clemenza, pay
attention to this.</i>

06:18.403 --> 06:19.937
But Clemenza's bruised ego...

06:19.938 --> 06:20.838
Really?
You picked me last?

06:20.839 --> 06:21.705
you.

06:21.706 --> 06:23.807
And his bad attitude

06:23.808 --> 06:26.110
led Justin to question
his dedication.

06:26.111 --> 06:28.646
I want you to just get your head
right where it needs to be.

06:28.647 --> 06:30.314
Like, what the ?

06:30.315 --> 06:32.216
<i>Who the do you think
you're talking to?</i>

06:32.217 --> 06:33.150
<i>Dude, you got a problem,
you should just go</i>

06:33.151 --> 06:34.785
the home.
I'm done.

06:34.786 --> 06:36.654
Find out now
if Justin will be going

06:36.655 --> 06:38.522
into the biggest dinner service
of his life...

06:38.523 --> 06:39.857
<i>Clemenza!</i>

06:39.858 --> 06:41.492
One chef down.

06:41.493 --> 06:45.129
<i>And now the conclusion
of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

06:45.130 --> 06:47.131
Come on, Clemenza.
Please.

06:49.467 --> 06:51.201
<i>You do focus in your own way,</i>

06:51.202 --> 06:52.202
but I really need you
to be locked in,

06:52.203 --> 06:53.671
<i>down to the tee.</i>

06:53.672 --> 06:55.739
You know, it kind
of really pissed me off

06:55.740 --> 06:57.775
not making it
into the final two.

06:57.776 --> 07:00.577
But as pissed off as I am,
I can't leave Justin.

07:00.578 --> 07:03.180
Here's my thing.
Am I angry

07:03.181 --> 07:04.481
<i>that I went home?
Yeah.</i>

07:04.482 --> 07:06.216
And I'm gonna tell you why.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.618
I should still have been
standing there with you guys.

07:07.619 --> 07:08.619
100%.

07:08.620 --> 07:09.987
I could have went
that one step further.

07:09.988 --> 07:11.422
We're past that now.

07:11.423 --> 07:12.890
That's over and done.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.258
You know what?
It's old .

07:14.259 --> 07:15.159
It doesn't matter to me.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.193
<i>But...
there's a but.</i>

07:16.194 --> 07:17.561
I know I can do this, dude.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.762
I hope so.

07:18.763 --> 07:20.431
<i>I said it.
I said, "man,</i>

07:20.432 --> 07:22.566
"I've never been surprised
by one person

07:22.567 --> 07:25.235
more in my life than I've
been surprised by Clemenza."

07:25.236 --> 07:27.404
And tomorrow I need
the biggest surprise of my life.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.106
You know,
at the end of the day,

07:29.107 --> 07:31.108
I do hope Justin wins,
but all that money

07:31.109 --> 07:32.710
ain't gonna do for me.

07:32.711 --> 07:33.877
The bottom line is,
you got to want it.

07:33.878 --> 07:36.480
The hunger's got to be there.
The passion's got to be there.

07:36.481 --> 07:38.015
And right now
my heart was not here.

07:38.016 --> 07:40.117
I really hope that
you surprise me tomorrow

07:40.118 --> 07:42.519
even more than ever.

07:54.899 --> 07:56.867
You know, this is
the biggest day of my life.

07:56.868 --> 07:58.702
But I'm a little bit nervous
about Clemenza at this point.

07:58.703 --> 08:00.671
After last night's meeting,
he was just dark.

08:00.672 --> 08:02.873
I really need him
to have my back.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.176
This is it.

08:06.177 --> 08:08.011
I have a really big
dinner service ahead of me.

08:08.012 --> 08:10.381
I'm trying not to freak out.

08:10.382 --> 08:12.015
I'm definitely pumped
that Dana's on my team.

08:12.016 --> 08:14.017
Dana is kind of my savior.

08:14.018 --> 08:16.253
I honestly can't imagine
cooking here without her.

08:16.254 --> 08:18.422
I feel like I need to get out,
like, one good cry.

08:18.423 --> 08:20.591
Well, you're gonna have
to wait until the end.

08:20.592 --> 08:23.227
Yeah.
With the final dinner service

08:23.228 --> 08:24.695
just 12 hours away...

08:24.696 --> 08:27.297
You ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.

08:27.298 --> 08:29.066
Christina and
Justin gather their teams

08:29.067 --> 08:30.401
for a quick briefing.

08:30.402 --> 08:31.935
I got that prep list
right there, Royce,

08:31.936 --> 08:33.102
if you want to look at it.

08:33.104 --> 08:34.871
But one chef...

08:34.873 --> 08:36.807
<i>Where did Clemenza go?
I don't know.</i>

08:36.808 --> 08:38.008
That's the thing
that baffles me right now.

08:38.009 --> 08:39.042
<i>I wish I knew.</i>

08:39.043 --> 08:40.644
Is missing in action.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.880
Just want to go home.
Last day.

08:42.881 --> 08:45.649
I guess that my... rest of
the team is down on the patio.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.651
I know.
I mean, I know what I got to do.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.287
I mean, you need me,
you should come get me.

08:50.288 --> 08:51.422
I got to go.

08:51.423 --> 08:54.158
This is the most important
moment of my life right now.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.292
There's no around.

08:55.293 --> 08:56.593
I'm worried about Clemenza.

08:56.594 --> 08:57.561
I just want him kicking
to another gear.

08:57.562 --> 08:59.396
Yo.
Let's do it.

08:59.397 --> 09:01.098
Clemenza's not moving
very fast right now.

09:01.099 --> 09:03.066
I need Clemenza
to stay focused.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.369
I need him to be able to prep
as hard as he possibly can.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.271
I'm worried about getting
everything done on time.

09:07.272 --> 09:08.872
Let's do this, baby.

09:08.873 --> 09:10.808
With almost everyone motivated

09:10.809 --> 09:12.976
and ready for action,
Christina and Justin

09:12.977 --> 09:15.279
lead their brigades
to the kitchens early

09:15.280 --> 09:17.981
to prepare for the biggest
dinner service of their lives.

09:17.982 --> 09:19.650
Real focused.
Real serious, guys.

09:19.651 --> 09:21.251
Let's get going.

09:21.252 --> 09:23.153
Justin is all
business this morning...

09:23.154 --> 09:23.787
Black cod don't cook yet,
Royce.

09:23.788 --> 09:25.322
All right, Justin.

09:25.323 --> 09:27.357
And is
focused on every detail.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.725
Barbie, we got to get
those raviolis made.

09:28.726 --> 09:30.227
<i>Hurry up.
Oui, chef.</i>

09:30.228 --> 09:31.762
I have so much to do
when it comes to prep.

09:31.763 --> 09:34.565
I'm managing a new menu,
a whole kitchen.

09:34.566 --> 09:36.433
I'm trying
to get everybody focused.

09:36.434 --> 09:37.801
Make sure you save me
that liquid, Barbie.

09:37.802 --> 09:39.403
I want to make sure
that my dishes are correct.

09:39.404 --> 09:40.971
I want to make sure everything's
exactly where I want it to be.

09:40.972 --> 09:42.406
Make sure it's not too sweet,

09:42.407 --> 09:44.107
not too acidic, not too strong.

09:44.108 --> 09:45.742
I got to make sure
that they're driving.

09:45.743 --> 09:47.010
I got to make sure
they're not slowing down.

09:47.011 --> 09:48.111
I got to make sure
they're focused.

09:48.112 --> 09:49.413
You know, I can't do everything
right now, guys.

09:49.414 --> 09:50.981
While Justin continues

09:50.982 --> 09:53.283
to be a culinary drillmaster...
Let's go, guys.

09:53.284 --> 09:55.352
Hard. Push, push. Push.
What?

09:55.353 --> 09:57.888
Christina...
It's gonna be good, buddy.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.657
Has chosen to take
the exact opposite approach.

10:00.658 --> 10:02.659
I want to be
able to start off today

10:02.660 --> 10:03.627
putting my faith
in my teammates.

10:03.628 --> 10:04.461
I just want to go out.
I want to have fun.

10:04.462 --> 10:05.562
Let's have fun with it.

10:05.563 --> 10:06.797
Buddy, how's it looking?

10:06.798 --> 10:08.932
On.
It's on.

10:08.933 --> 10:11.134
Let's find our rhythm.
Let's have fun tonight.

10:11.135 --> 10:12.870
You guys can call me
whatever you want.

10:12.871 --> 10:14.204
Don't call me chef.
I won't answer.

10:14.205 --> 10:15.339
I'm gonna call you
"biotch."

10:15.340 --> 10:17.341
The final dinner service

10:17.342 --> 10:18.909
is fast approaching.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.410
You know, we're not prepping
for 10,000 people.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.012
<i>We're prepping for 40.</i>

10:22.013 --> 10:23.947
But prior to the doors opening,

10:23.948 --> 10:25.449
chef Ramsay wants
to evaluate the state

10:25.450 --> 10:27.217
of Christina
and Justin's menus.

10:27.218 --> 10:28.719
Justin, let's make sure

10:28.720 --> 10:30.254
we're pushing to get plates up
asap, okay?

10:30.255 --> 10:31.455
<i>Yes, chef.
You guys, hurry up.</i>

10:31.456 --> 10:32.589
We need to start plating.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.024
All the sauces, you got ladles.

10:34.025 --> 10:36.059
Garlic, shallot,
butter, everything.

10:36.060 --> 10:37.394
I'm definitely nervous

10:37.395 --> 10:39.096
to have chef Ramsay
taste my menu.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.664
I'm nervous
to have him taste anything.

10:40.665 --> 10:41.899
This is, like,
kind of my last chance

10:41.900 --> 10:43.233
to make those quick fixes.

10:43.234 --> 10:45.202
I'm realizing we just have
so much to do.

10:45.203 --> 10:46.737
Five minutes?

10:46.738 --> 10:48.970
Ten minutes? Dana, talk to me.
How long?

10:48.971 --> 10:50.641
See you get that done
right away, okay?

10:50.642 --> 10:51.909
<i>Push it hard.
Push it hard.</i>

10:51.910 --> 10:53.210
Time is running out.

10:53.211 --> 10:55.112
<i>Two minutes. Let's go.</i>

10:55.113 --> 10:56.980
Give me some olive oil up here.

10:56.981 --> 10:59.216
Fast.
Um, you have that goat cheese.

10:59.217 --> 11:01.084
How long, please?
Less than a minute, chef.

11:01.085 --> 11:02.452
Hurry up.
Let's go.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.854
Coming out.
Coming out.

11:03.855 --> 11:05.656
Shut that. Shut that.

11:05.657 --> 11:07.491
What is that?
What was that?

11:07.492 --> 11:09.493
crostini.

11:09.494 --> 11:12.696
Oh, Clemenza!
Clemenza!

11:12.697 --> 11:13.730
This is not good.

11:13.731 --> 11:15.232
Oh, my God.

11:15.233 --> 11:17.467
You just burned
the crostini.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.735
me.
You got to get that

11:18.736 --> 11:20.137
on fire right away.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.805
Get that thing out of here,
in the garbage,

11:21.806 --> 11:23.106
<i>and get some more
on the fire right away.</i>

11:23.107 --> 11:24.508
I'm 100% concerned
about the station right now.

11:24.509 --> 11:26.109
This is just a disaster, man.

11:26.110 --> 11:27.311
I don't know what we can do.

11:27.312 --> 11:28.612
Come on, guys.

11:28.613 --> 11:30.347
All right, Justin,
are we ready?

11:30.348 --> 11:31.982
Just one last dish, chef.
Two seconds.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.150
<i>Hurry up. Let's go.</i>

11:33.151 --> 11:34.151
<i>Come on, Clemenza.</i>

11:34.152 --> 11:35.586
Come on.
Come on.

11:35.587 --> 11:37.054
We should not be prepping
right now.

11:37.055 --> 11:38.088
<i>Clemenza, what are you doing?</i>

11:38.089 --> 11:39.790
You're literally breaking down.

11:39.791 --> 11:42.092
<i>You are literally
breaking down.</i>

11:47.052 --> 11:48.653
It's less than 90 minutes

11:48.654 --> 11:50.721
until the final dinner service.

11:50.722 --> 11:52.623
But before the doors can open,

11:52.624 --> 11:54.859
Justin and Christina's menus
must be signed off on

11:54.860 --> 11:56.560
by chef Ramsay.

11:56.561 --> 11:58.162
But Justin is having issues
with...

11:58.163 --> 12:00.097
Clemenza!
What are you doing?

12:00.098 --> 12:01.799
What is that?
What was that?

12:01.800 --> 12:03.668
<i>It's the crostini.</i>

12:03.669 --> 12:05.303
Get that thing out of here,
in the garbage,

12:05.304 --> 12:07.004
<i>and get some more
on the fire right away.</i>

12:07.005 --> 12:08.239
All right, Justin, we ready?
Just one last dish, chef.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.907
Two seconds. Yes, chef.
How long, please?

12:09.908 --> 12:11.175
Less than a minute, chef.

12:11.176 --> 12:12.343
Hurry up.
Let's go.

12:12.344 --> 12:14.545
Clemenza, the crust...
crostinis!

12:14.546 --> 12:16.147
<i>Thank you!</i>

12:17.249 --> 12:18.382
Thank God.

12:18.383 --> 12:20.251
I picked Brian for a reason.

12:20.252 --> 12:23.020
Justin doesn't have to worry
about anything.

12:23.021 --> 12:25.122
I'm gonna fight for him
tooth and nail,

12:25.123 --> 12:27.758
so he's good.

12:27.759 --> 12:29.260
Okay, Justin, let's go.

12:29.261 --> 12:30.461
<i>Let's start off from the top.</i>

12:30.462 --> 12:31.662
First dish is?

12:31.663 --> 12:33.531
<i>Sambuca-cured wild salmon.</i>

12:33.532 --> 12:35.099
Sambuca-cured
wild salmon.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.701
<i>Oui, chef.
Fennel, kalamata olives.</i>

12:36.702 --> 12:37.802
Micro basil on top.

12:37.803 --> 12:39.303
You just get pounded

12:39.304 --> 12:40.471
with salt from the olives.

12:40.472 --> 12:41.505
<i>Oui, chef.</i>

12:41.506 --> 12:42.773
We need less olive on that.

12:42.774 --> 12:43.774
Absolutely.
Next dish.

12:43.775 --> 12:46.010
This is the...
Oh, dear.

12:46.011 --> 12:47.311
This is the...
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

12:47.312 --> 12:48.179
What happened there?

12:48.180 --> 12:49.547
It looks snotty.

12:49.548 --> 12:52.149
What is it?
It's a flat rice-crusted cod.

12:52.150 --> 12:53.918
Truffled potato puree,
basil beurre blanc.

12:53.919 --> 12:55.820
You've got
such lovely flavors there.

12:55.821 --> 12:57.455
Look at it
with a different presentation.

12:57.456 --> 12:58.689
It's awkward to eat.
Yes, chef.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.191
You can do better.
Yes, chef.

13:00.192 --> 13:02.093
This one?
This is the rib-eye

13:02.094 --> 13:05.129
with a crispy shallot on top.
Uh-huh.

13:06.998 --> 13:08.432
That's delicious.

13:08.433 --> 13:10.334
Thank you, chef.
I mean, really good indeed.

13:10.335 --> 13:12.036
Thank you, chef.
Don't try to be too clever.

13:12.037 --> 13:13.571
Give these dishes
some finesse, okay?

13:13.572 --> 13:15.039
Sure. No problem.
Come on.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.207
Yeah?
I can get it fixed, chef.

13:16.208 --> 13:17.742
Guys, let's get up here,
everyone.

13:17.743 --> 13:19.176
The suggestions
that chef Ramsay makes

13:19.177 --> 13:20.811
are just unbelievable.

13:20.812 --> 13:22.813
And I might just make
a minor tweak here or there,

13:22.814 --> 13:24.949
<i>but with my menu I'm gonna win
Hell's Kitchen.</i>

13:24.950 --> 13:26.951
I have what it takes,
and I'm ready to do it.

13:26.952 --> 13:28.285
This is good.
It's just a bigger bowl now.

13:28.286 --> 13:30.554
Okay, what's Christina
putting on the plate?

13:30.555 --> 13:31.956
First dish, what is that?

13:31.957 --> 13:33.724
Seared scallops, charred corn,

13:33.725 --> 13:37.061
<i>and asparagus risotto.</i>

13:37.062 --> 13:38.229
It's nice.

13:38.230 --> 13:39.997
Thank you, chef.
Nice flavor. Next.

13:39.998 --> 13:43.167
This is
a jumbo lump crab meat salad,

13:43.168 --> 13:45.269
<i>jicama, jalapeno, little bit
of coconut with ginger.</i>

13:45.270 --> 13:46.871
You know, it needs
a little bit of help.

13:46.872 --> 13:48.539
Could it go
in a cocktail glass?

13:48.540 --> 13:50.007
Could it go in something
a bit more sexier?

13:50.008 --> 13:51.375
<i>It just...
it doesn't do it justice.</i>

13:51.376 --> 13:52.943
The flavors are there,
but you got to execute it

13:52.944 --> 13:53.878
better than that, yeah?
Okay. Yes.

13:53.879 --> 13:55.079
What is that?

13:55.080 --> 13:56.947
It's pork loin,
cut, broken down,

13:56.948 --> 13:59.784
<i>and braised collards.
Mm-hmm.</i>

13:59.785 --> 14:01.252
Delicious.
Less collard greens in there.

14:01.253 --> 14:03.254
Yeah?
Okay. Yes.

14:03.255 --> 14:05.890
This is your most creative
dishes so far.

14:05.891 --> 14:07.658
Just give it a little bit
of oomph, yeah?

14:07.659 --> 14:08.426
<i>Yes.
Right, you got work to do.</i>

14:08.427 --> 14:09.794
Got to hurry up, yeah?

14:09.795 --> 14:11.629
This was actually not that bad.

14:11.630 --> 14:13.564
It was a few changes
and replate some things.

14:13.565 --> 14:15.566
I know there's work
yet to be done,

14:15.567 --> 14:17.868
but I'm gonna make sure
I'm ready for that first ticket.

14:17.869 --> 14:19.537
I'm excited.

14:23.141 --> 14:25.443
Nice.
That looks lovely.

14:25.444 --> 14:27.578
Much better on that.

14:27.579 --> 14:29.713
Chef Ramsay was impressed
by Christina and Justin's menus.

14:29.714 --> 14:30.915
Good.
Justin.

14:30.916 --> 14:32.049
Yes, chef.
Much better, yes?

14:32.050 --> 14:33.517
Yes, chef.
Thank you.

14:33.518 --> 14:35.019
And now,
with only minutes left

14:35.020 --> 14:36.253
before the doors open,

14:36.254 --> 14:38.789
the two finalists
have one last meeting

14:38.790 --> 14:40.057
with their teams.

14:40.058 --> 14:41.725
Guys, I need you to step away

14:41.726 --> 14:43.527
from whatever you're doing,
finish it up,

14:43.528 --> 14:45.596
<i>and meet me in the back here.
Guys, 30 seconds, please.</i>

14:45.597 --> 14:47.131
Okay, this is it.
This is your last chance.

14:47.132 --> 14:48.432
It's my last chance.
I need you behind me.

14:48.433 --> 14:49.934
It's got to be my way.

14:49.935 --> 14:52.570
I loved working
with all you guys honestly.

14:52.571 --> 14:54.405
I love that you guys
have my back.

14:54.406 --> 14:56.207
<i>This is the biggest night
of my life.</i>

14:56.208 --> 14:57.408
If you have questions,
just please ask me.

14:57.409 --> 14:58.843
You guys all know how to cook.

14:58.844 --> 15:00.177
Do what you know how to do
and give me that food right.

15:00.178 --> 15:01.178
I picked this team
for a reason.

15:01.179 --> 15:02.379
Please don't let me down.

15:02.380 --> 15:04.215
Let's crush tonight.

15:04.216 --> 15:06.350

Yes, chef.

15:09.020 --> 15:11.455
Excellent. James.

After a marathon of challenges

15:34.145 --> 15:36.380
and dinner services,
the finale is here.

15:36.381 --> 15:40.317
And guests are pouring in
to enjoy the culinary creations

15:40.318 --> 15:42.653
of this year's
top two competitors.

15:42.654 --> 15:44.321
I'll take the veal chop.

15:44.322 --> 15:46.757
The seared halibut.
The rib-eye please.

15:46.758 --> 15:48.692
Both finalists' family members

15:48.693 --> 15:50.828
are here to support them
on what is clearly

15:50.829 --> 15:51.962
the biggest night
of their lives.

15:51.963 --> 15:53.397
Thank you.

15:53.398 --> 15:55.599
Tonight, dinner
service will determine

15:55.600 --> 15:57.601
<i>who will not only be the winner
of Hell's Kitchen,</i>

15:57.602 --> 16:00.738
but who will be Gordon Ramsay's
new head chef

16:00.739 --> 16:02.673
at his brand-new
Vegas restaurant.

16:02.674 --> 16:04.341
Good luck to you both.
Thank you, chef.

16:04.342 --> 16:05.509
Let's go.

16:05.510 --> 16:07.645
Here we go.

two scallop.

16:10.015 --> 16:11.782

16:11.783 --> 16:13.517
Robyn, you got to tell Dana
when you're four minutes out

16:13.518 --> 16:15.352
<i>on that risotto.
Got it.</i>

16:15.353 --> 16:16.820
Thank you, James.

16:16.821 --> 16:18.756
<i>Listen up. Order in.
Pay attention, guys.</i>

16:18.757 --> 16:20.591
Last chance
to cook in this kitchen.

16:20.592 --> 16:21.859
Two salmon, ceviche,
crab cake, ravioli.

16:21.860 --> 16:23.827
Heard.

16:23.828 --> 16:25.729
Two salmon, ceviche,
crab cake, ravioli.

16:25.730 --> 16:27.031
Heard.
"Yes, chef," guys.

16:27.032 --> 16:28.666
"Yes, chef."
Respond to me.

16:28.667 --> 16:30.034
I'm reading it again.
You pay attention to me.

16:30.035 --> 16:31.502
Two salmon,
one ceviche,

16:31.503 --> 16:32.803
<i>one crab cake, one ravioli.</i>

16:32.804 --> 16:34.071
Yes, chef.

16:34.072 --> 16:35.940
Talk it out. Let's go.
Yes, chef.

16:35.941 --> 16:37.474
Crab cakes are in the oven
in about two minutes.

16:37.475 --> 16:39.410
Robyn, how long on the risotto?

16:39.411 --> 16:42.012
<i>Three minutes.
Three minutes.</i>

16:42.013 --> 16:43.814
<i>I'm watching this.
Three minutes, Robyn.</i>

16:43.815 --> 16:44.715
<i>Be honest with the times.
Yup.</i>

16:44.716 --> 16:46.817
I am being honest.

16:46.818 --> 16:48.819
<i>I got to trust you.
Yes.</i>

16:50.088 --> 16:53.023
Robyn's proven
to be a cancer on any team.

16:53.024 --> 16:55.059
You know, the attitude
and being careless.

16:55.060 --> 16:57.795
I know I really have to keep
a close eye on her.

16:57.796 --> 16:59.663
<i>Push that risotto.
It's cooking.</i>

16:59.664 --> 17:00.831
Come on, Robyn.

17:00.832 --> 17:01.899
Walking with risotto.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.334
Don't hit chef Andi.

17:03.335 --> 17:04.734
While Christina continues

17:04.736 --> 17:06.770
to closely monitor Robyn

17:06.771 --> 17:07.972
on the appetizers...

17:07.973 --> 17:10.074
Service, please.

17:10.075 --> 17:12.309
In the blue kitchen...

17:12.310 --> 17:13.978
Royce, let's go.
Push it out.

17:13.979 --> 17:15.045
Talk to Clemenza.
Walking up to the window

17:15.046 --> 17:16.480
with the three crab.

17:16.481 --> 17:18.182
Justin is counting on Royce

17:18.183 --> 17:20.184
to deliver on their first table
of appetizers.

17:20.185 --> 17:21.885
Where's my sauce, Royce?

17:21.886 --> 17:23.587
Coming. Where's my sauce?
I need it now.

17:24.856 --> 17:27.156
Cold in the middle.
Come on.

17:27.157 --> 17:29.026
Royce, they got
to be hot in the middle, man.

17:29.027 --> 17:30.794
Get up on it.
Get up on it.

17:30.795 --> 17:32.830
All right.
Let's go.

17:32.831 --> 17:34.999
Let's go with that crab cake.
I need it right now.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.567
You know,
it's definitely difficult.

17:36.568 --> 17:38.102
I'm expediting to Royce,

17:38.103 --> 17:39.703
and he's just not moving
fast enough.

17:39.704 --> 17:40.971
He needs to realize
this is my career,

17:40.972 --> 17:42.773
this is my life.
That's no joke, man.

17:42.774 --> 17:45.075
Push, guys, push like you've
never pushed before.

17:45.076 --> 17:46.577
Push!
Let's go.

17:46.578 --> 17:47.911
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

17:47.912 --> 17:49.346
Push this ticket.
Let's go.

17:49.347 --> 17:51.782
<i>Walking up now.</i>

17:51.783 --> 17:54.418
<i>Crab is in the window
it needs a garnish.</i>

17:54.419 --> 17:55.819
He's gone dry now.

17:55.820 --> 17:57.354
The first two, lukewarm.

17:57.355 --> 17:58.956
<i>Now he's drying them out.</i>

17:58.957 --> 18:00.524
Royce, Royce, Royce.

18:00.525 --> 18:02.493
Come here. Come here.
These are dry, man.

18:02.494 --> 18:04.128
Dry. Come on, you got to give me
better than that.

18:04.129 --> 18:05.896
Come on. Get this passed here.
Let's go.

18:05.897 --> 18:07.064
Wake up, Royce.

18:07.065 --> 18:08.799
<i>It's the first ticket.
Brian.</i>

18:08.800 --> 18:10.934
Yes. Get over there and
help those crab cakes.

18:10.935 --> 18:13.037
<i>Got it.
Get 'em done, Royce.</i>

18:13.038 --> 18:13.971
Yes, chef.
I The crab cake up.

18:13.972 --> 18:16.240
Royce up
the crab cake order.

18:16.241 --> 18:19.376
But Justin's like, "ugh,
, , ugh!"

18:19.377 --> 18:20.844
He's not helping anybody.

18:20.845 --> 18:22.646
Royce, how long?
We got four minutes.

18:22.647 --> 18:24.014
<i>Four minutes?</i>

18:24.015 --> 18:25.516
Okay, guys, let's go.
Push this food out.

18:25.517 --> 18:27.384
Royce, come on.

18:27.385 --> 18:29.386
Let's go.
Give me those three crab cakes.

18:29.387 --> 18:30.654
<i>Get 'em hot and get 'em up here
right away.</i>

18:30.655 --> 18:31.488
I'm not going behind
this early.

18:31.489 --> 18:33.857
Let's go.

18:39.139 --> 18:42.675
It's 25 minutes
into the all-important

18:42.676 --> 18:44.977
final dinner service.
Royce. Royce. Royce.

18:44.978 --> 18:47.346
But Royce's
overcooked crab cakes...

18:47.347 --> 18:49.415
It's dry. Come on, you got
to give me better than that.

18:49.416 --> 18:51.016
Has already put Justin

18:51.017 --> 18:52.752
in a little bit of a hole.

18:52.753 --> 18:54.754
I'm dying here, guys.
Dying in the window right now.

18:54.755 --> 18:56.589
These people want to eat.
Let's go. Royce, come on.

18:56.590 --> 18:58.758
<i>Come on.
I'm dying here. Let's go.</i>

18:58.759 --> 19:01.060
Justin's like,
"I'm freaking out right now!

19:01.061 --> 19:04.997
"I can't keep my face on!
Aagh!

19:04.998 --> 19:10.669
"Everything is dying, and I
can't get food in the window.

19:10.670 --> 19:12.338
Why?"

19:12.339 --> 19:14.607
Crab cake, where are you?
Crab in my hand, chef.

19:14.608 --> 19:16.108
Come on, man.
Come on.

19:16.109 --> 19:18.844
Yo, Justin, you got to relax.

19:18.845 --> 19:20.579
<i>Good, Justin. Very good.</i>

19:20.580 --> 19:22.014
<i>Thank you, chef
very good indeed.</i>

19:22.015 --> 19:24.383
Step off, baby.
You picked the Rolls-Royce.

19:24.384 --> 19:26.118
Uh-uh.

19:26.119 --> 19:28.387
<i>Keep it going.
Good. Well done.</i>

19:28.388 --> 19:30.389
With Justin
holding on to his standards

19:30.390 --> 19:32.458
and Royce finally nailing
the refire

19:32.459 --> 19:34.794
on his crab cakes,
diners on the blue side

19:34.795 --> 19:36.495
are pleased
with their appetizers.

19:36.496 --> 19:37.530
Wow, this is delicious.

19:37.531 --> 19:39.765
Really good.

19:39.766 --> 19:42.067
Unfortunately,
it's been a while

19:42.068 --> 19:43.636
since anything left
the red kitchen.

19:43.637 --> 19:45.638
Robyn, I need that risotto!

19:45.639 --> 19:47.807
I got it right here.
Making love to it, babe.

19:47.808 --> 19:49.975
All day long.
Dana, how long on those scallops?

19:49.976 --> 19:52.077
Dana, I need 'em.
I need 'em now.

19:52.078 --> 19:53.445
Yes, chef!

19:53.446 --> 19:56.782
I'm trying 100%.
I'm trying my hardest.

19:56.783 --> 19:58.651
I'm trying to get
these scallops out.

19:58.652 --> 20:00.219
I don't want
to make Christina look bad,

20:00.220 --> 20:01.220
especially tonight.

20:01.221 --> 20:02.488
Dana! Dana!

20:02.489 --> 20:03.856
I'm right behind you.

20:03.857 --> 20:06.358
Thank you.
Drop. Drop.

20:06.359 --> 20:08.360
They're very dark
on the bottom.

20:08.361 --> 20:09.829
Is that what you wanted
that way?

20:09.830 --> 20:11.230
No.
That is disgusting.

20:11.231 --> 20:13.332
Robyn, Dana, I need you.

20:13.333 --> 20:15.234
Now.
Come up.

20:15.235 --> 20:16.969
Dana, come on. Come on.
Oh, me.

20:16.970 --> 20:19.104
Come on, man.
Help me out.

20:19.105 --> 20:21.707
This needs to be... you can tell
it's not bound properly.

20:21.708 --> 20:23.375
It's bleeding out too much.

20:23.376 --> 20:25.010
Come on, get that tight.
Get that together.

20:25.011 --> 20:26.078
I'm getting it tight right now
for you, girl.

20:26.079 --> 20:27.346
I got you, chef.

20:27.347 --> 20:29.481
Aaah!

20:29.482 --> 20:31.517
It's so frustrating
having my risotto

20:31.518 --> 20:33.018
go to the pass, then come back.

20:33.019 --> 20:34.420
And it's not my fault.

20:34.421 --> 20:35.754
It's been sitting up there
too long,

20:35.755 --> 20:37.022
'cause waiting on scallops.

20:37.023 --> 20:39.458
Dana, I need those scallops!
30 seconds.

20:39.459 --> 20:41.293
<i>All right, it's tight.</i>

20:41.294 --> 20:43.462
I'm walking the risotto.
Take this spoon, please.

20:43.463 --> 20:44.930
Dana, don't let me lose
these too.

20:44.931 --> 20:46.765
<i>I need those scallops bad.</i>

20:46.766 --> 20:48.901
Tick-tock,
tick-tock,

20:48.902 --> 20:51.570
tick-tick-tick-tick-tock.

20:51.571 --> 20:53.706
Where the
are the scallops?

20:53.707 --> 20:55.674
Walking scallops to the window.

20:56.977 --> 20:58.477
Wait two seconds.
Wait two seconds.

20:58.478 --> 20:59.845
Double-check.
Okay.

20:59.846 --> 21:02.314
You have to touch there.
Touch.

21:02.315 --> 21:04.383
Better, Dana.
Order.

21:04.384 --> 21:06.385
35 is up.
Very nice indeed.

21:06.386 --> 21:07.953
<i>Yes, thank you.</i>

21:07.954 --> 21:10.089
Thank God, the apps are over.

21:11.658 --> 21:13.592
Christina's kitchen

21:13.593 --> 21:14.894
has recovered and completed
all their appetizers.

21:14.895 --> 21:17.162
Oh, wow.
This is delicious.

21:17.163 --> 21:20.132
And while her kitchen's
delivery of food was a little slow,

21:20.133 --> 21:22.434
it seems to be worth the wait.

21:22.435 --> 21:25.304
Meanwhile, Justin is trying
to move on

21:25.305 --> 21:27.306
to his first table of entrees.

21:27.307 --> 21:30.042
But there's one nagging problem
standing in his way.

21:30.043 --> 21:31.644
Two salmon
one ravioli, one...

21:31.645 --> 21:32.978
Two salmon, yes.
Sorry.

21:32.979 --> 21:34.380
Clemenza, please.
Yes, chef.

21:34.381 --> 21:35.614
<i>Two salmon and a ravioli, yeah?</i>

21:35.615 --> 21:37.249
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

21:37.250 --> 21:39.985
I'm good. Don't worry,
don't worry, don't worry.

21:39.986 --> 21:41.287
Come on, Clemenza!

21:41.288 --> 21:42.688
<i>It's the last table of apps.</i>

21:42.689 --> 21:43.856
<i>Let's go.
Right here.</i>

21:43.857 --> 21:45.591
I can walk
with the apps now.

21:45.592 --> 21:47.393
You got to stop telling me yes.

21:47.394 --> 21:48.994
Clemenza's a
disaster right now.

21:48.995 --> 21:50.529
He's got to pull it together,
you know.

21:50.530 --> 21:51.563
I'm just looking at him
like, "come on, man.

21:51.564 --> 21:52.431
Please, just get it
together."

21:52.432 --> 21:53.666
Come on!
Get me that!

21:53.667 --> 21:55.134
Give it to me.
Got it. Go.

21:55.135 --> 21:56.135
Good?

21:56.136 --> 21:58.404
Can I start send...
okay.

21:58.405 --> 22:00.773
Now!
Sorry. Raw.

22:00.774 --> 22:03.242
It's raw.
It's raw.

22:03.243 --> 22:05.110
It's just so unfair.
Clemenza.

22:05.111 --> 22:06.378
Yes!
Come on.

22:06.379 --> 22:07.513
Come on, man.
Look at this.

22:07.514 --> 22:09.381
Dead raw.

22:09.382 --> 22:12.318
Raw, raw, raw.

22:12.319 --> 22:14.687
Come on.
Come on.

22:14.688 --> 22:16.722
Gotcha.
Clemenza, it's ridicul...

22:16.723 --> 22:18.557
I don't know what you're doing.

22:18.558 --> 22:19.658
<i>It's almost like you want
to sabotage him.</i>

22:19.659 --> 22:20.826
<i>Come on, Clemenza.</i>

22:20.827 --> 22:22.661
<i>Yes, chef!
Bite the bullet.</i>

22:22.662 --> 22:24.863
<i>Don't bury me. Don't bury me.</i>

22:24.864 --> 22:26.832
<i>No, no, no,
I will not burn you.</i>

22:26.833 --> 22:27.733
<i>Get it together.
Yes, chef.</i>

22:27.734 --> 22:29.435
I can be a sometimes.

22:29.436 --> 22:31.503
But I know I need
to step my game up now.

22:31.504 --> 22:33.405
It's hard to take
the backseat sometimes.

22:33.406 --> 22:35.274
But sometimes you need
to realize

22:35.275 --> 22:37.009
you may have
to take the backseat.

22:37.010 --> 22:38.610
There's other ways
you can shine.

22:38.611 --> 22:40.346
Coming in,
coming in, coming in.

22:42.782 --> 22:44.616
Clemenza, thank you.

22:44.617 --> 22:46.085
Yes, chef.

22:46.086 --> 22:47.987
With Clemenza back on board

22:47.988 --> 22:49.788
and working for Justin
and not against him...

22:49.789 --> 22:52.157
Let's go!

22:52.158 --> 22:53.892
The last appetizers are leaving

22:53.893 --> 22:55.527
the blue kitchen.
Thank you.

22:55.528 --> 22:56.996
And Justin can now move on

22:56.997 --> 22:58.397
to his entrees.

22:58.398 --> 23:00.165
Meanwhile,
in the red kitchen...

23:00.166 --> 23:01.967
Two halibut,
one pork, one veal.

23:01.968 --> 23:03.268
How long?
20 seconds.

23:03.269 --> 23:04.636
<i>20 seconds.</i>

23:04.637 --> 23:05.871
Their first table of entrees

23:05.872 --> 23:07.306
is almost complete.

23:07.307 --> 23:09.041
In the pan, Dana.
Work that out. I need it now.

23:09.042 --> 23:10.342
They're getting color.

23:10.343 --> 23:12.378
And after some problems

23:12.379 --> 23:14.913
with the appetizers, Christina
is keeping a watchful eye

23:14.914 --> 23:16.515
on her fish cook Dana.

23:16.516 --> 23:18.050
Dana, how are you working
this halibut?

23:18.051 --> 23:19.284
<i>Is this cooked already?</i>

23:19.285 --> 23:21.153
Yeah, it's cooked already.

23:21.154 --> 23:22.855
Dana, give me a new one.
Why?

23:22.856 --> 23:24.690
I need a better...
I need this sear on this.

23:24.691 --> 23:27.126
I don't think
there's anything wrong with it.

23:27.127 --> 23:29.395
At this point,
my friendship with Dana

23:29.396 --> 23:31.330
it doesn't mean anything
right now.

23:31.331 --> 23:32.998
I'm not in a position
to tell her,

23:32.999 --> 23:34.633
"oh, you know,
don't worry, buddy.

23:34.634 --> 23:36.468
You got it.
I'm gonna let this slide."

23:36.469 --> 23:38.103
I can't do that.
My ass is on the line now.

23:38.104 --> 23:39.972
Kill those.
Kill those once

23:39.973 --> 23:41.240
without the sear.

23:41.241 --> 23:42.441
I can't put it in the...

23:42.442 --> 23:43.675
there's nothing wrong with it.

23:43.676 --> 23:45.044
No, you don't want it?
Dana!

23:45.045 --> 23:46.011
<i>All I need from you
is halibut, Dana.</i>

23:46.012 --> 23:47.379
Thank you.

23:47.380 --> 23:49.348
"A."

23:49.349 --> 23:51.450
Christina's like,
"recook the halibut."

23:51.451 --> 23:52.851
I'm like, "I don't have time
for that , okay?"

23:52.852 --> 23:54.653
If something is wrong

23:54.654 --> 23:56.922
with these halibut, I don't know
what I'm gonna do with myself.

23:56.923 --> 23:58.290
Dana, I need 'em.

23:58.291 --> 23:59.758
Coming right now.
Walking, walking.

23:59.759 --> 24:01.527
<i>Get it up.</i>

24:01.528 --> 24:02.961
Let's go.
Slice of meat.

24:02.962 --> 24:04.229
Right behind, right behind,

24:04.230 --> 24:05.164
right behind.
Is the fish coming?

24:05.165 --> 24:07.499
Fish is right there.

24:09.135 --> 24:11.203
Dana!

24:11.204 --> 24:12.538
<i>Dana, I need you.
Yeah.</i>

24:12.539 --> 24:14.006
I need you.
What?

24:14.007 --> 24:15.641
Please, these are the ones
that died.

24:15.642 --> 24:17.209
No, they're not.
No, they're not.

24:17.210 --> 24:18.377
<i>It's over, Dana.
They're the ones</i>

24:18.378 --> 24:19.511
that were sitting there.

24:19.512 --> 24:21.080
No, they're not.
Dana, don't thwart her.

24:21.081 --> 24:22.081
Do what she says.
All right, fine.

24:22.082 --> 24:23.482
Die in the window.
Come on, guys.

24:23.483 --> 24:24.983
It's over.
Just give me two more now.

24:24.984 --> 24:26.652
I don't want to lose
this protein.

24:26.653 --> 24:27.653
No, there's nothing
wrong with it.

24:27.654 --> 24:29.288
<i>Dana!
No, it's fine.</i>

24:34.658 --> 24:36.959
It's an hour
into the dinner service

24:36.960 --> 24:38.795
<i>that will determine
the winner of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

24:38.796 --> 24:39.962
Stone cold.

24:39.963 --> 24:41.264
And Dana's performance

24:41.265 --> 24:42.231
on the fish station...

24:42.232 --> 24:43.933
Dana, come here.

24:43.934 --> 24:45.435
These are the ones that died.

24:45.436 --> 24:47.270
Look at how...
no, they're not.

24:47.271 --> 24:49.439
Has tempers rising.
Dana, don't thwart her.

24:49.440 --> 24:50.640
Do what she says.
All right, fine.

24:50.641 --> 24:52.075
And the red kitchen's

24:52.076 --> 24:53.811
starting to sink.
Just give me two more now.

24:53.812 --> 24:55.511
I don't want
to lose this protein.

24:55.512 --> 24:56.179
Can you tell me
what was wrong with them?

24:56.180 --> 24:57.780
It's over.

24:57.781 --> 24:59.349
Dana just screwed the pooch
big time.

24:59.350 --> 25:00.983
She's struggling pretty bad.

25:00.984 --> 25:02.318
This is the first table, Dana.

25:02.319 --> 25:03.886
<i>Yes, chef!</i>

25:03.887 --> 25:05.521
She needs to get
her act together

25:05.522 --> 25:06.489
and just get
this right.

25:06.490 --> 25:08.658
It's dry and it's mush.

25:08.659 --> 25:10.093
<i>It is way overcooked.
Yes, chef.</i>

25:11.628 --> 25:13.096
Count it down, guys.
Come on.

25:13.097 --> 25:14.697
I need Dana to fight back

25:14.698 --> 25:16.032
and fight back hard,
and I need her

25:16.033 --> 25:17.166
to start doing it now.

25:17.167 --> 25:18.968
Three minutes.
Three minutes.

25:18.969 --> 25:20.903
All this hard work
is about to disintegrate.

25:20.904 --> 25:22.839
You've got to get through
to her,

25:22.840 --> 25:24.240
or you make a decision and you
switch section with her.

25:24.241 --> 25:26.309
Yes, chef.

25:27.945 --> 25:29.479
<i>Dana, you got this.</i>

25:29.480 --> 25:31.114
I got you, you got me, yeah?

25:31.115 --> 25:32.749
Yes, chef.

25:32.750 --> 25:34.083
I'm gonna let her stay
in that station

25:34.084 --> 25:35.151
a little bit longer.

25:35.152 --> 25:36.419
Work it out.
Work it out.

25:36.420 --> 25:37.854
But this is it, dude.

25:37.855 --> 25:39.655
Like, this is your last chance.

25:39.656 --> 25:40.957
Like, seriously,
pull your together.

25:40.958 --> 25:42.925
Don't check out
on me now, please.

25:42.926 --> 25:44.894
As Dana tries to fight back

25:44.895 --> 25:47.797
on the fish station,
diners continue to wait.

25:47.798 --> 25:49.298
I'm ready.

25:49.299 --> 25:51.167
But over on the blue side,

25:51.168 --> 25:53.202
entrees are quickly leaving
the kitchen.

25:53.203 --> 25:55.471
Service, please.
Let's go.

25:55.472 --> 25:56.739
What's wrong with the fish?

25:56.740 --> 25:58.841
It's lukewarm.
Okay.

25:58.842 --> 26:01.477
But there is a
problem in the dining room.

26:01.478 --> 26:04.580
Justin, he just got this,
and it's cold.

26:04.581 --> 26:06.949
It's cold, chef.
Oh, no.

26:06.950 --> 26:08.684
Oh, come on.

26:08.685 --> 26:10.319
They're right.
It's cold in the middle.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.188
Royce.
Royce, come here.

26:12.189 --> 26:14.257
I can't believe this. I really
can't believe where we're at.

26:14.258 --> 26:15.958
You think
that I was on you before, guys.

26:15.959 --> 26:17.860
I'm gonna get on you now.
Got to be hot in the middle.

26:17.861 --> 26:19.595
Ticket, please.
I need it right away.

26:19.596 --> 26:21.197
Yeah.
Right now, Royce. Come on, man.

26:21.198 --> 26:22.665
<i>Yes, chef.
Come on.</i>

26:22.666 --> 26:24.033
You're better than that.
Let's go.

26:24.034 --> 26:25.435
Why's he blaming me?

26:25.436 --> 26:26.702
Justin should have
double-checked it,

26:26.703 --> 26:29.005
made sure of it, you know,
be an executive chef.

26:29.006 --> 26:30.473
Make sure
that salmon's cooked properly

26:30.474 --> 26:31.607
before you bring it to me.

26:31.608 --> 26:32.909
While Justin is more focused

26:32.910 --> 26:34.043
than ever...
Yes, chef.

26:34.044 --> 26:35.144
Don't send me stuff
you wouldn't want yourself.

26:35.145 --> 26:36.579
Yes, chef.

26:36.580 --> 26:38.614
Over in the red kitchen...
How long?

26:38.615 --> 26:40.850
I'm ready, chef.
Garnish is walking.

26:40.851 --> 26:43.786
Christina's team has
refired their first entree.

26:43.787 --> 26:45.388
Kimmie, walking up
with the beef.

26:45.389 --> 26:47.123
<i>Garnish.
Walking now.</i>

26:47.124 --> 26:48.691
Beef on your right.

26:48.692 --> 26:49.692
<i>Thank you.</i>

26:49.693 --> 26:50.827
How long, two halibut?

26:50.828 --> 26:52.695
45 seconds.

26:52.696 --> 26:54.564
Now all they're
waiting for is Dana...

26:54.565 --> 26:55.865
Push it, push it.

26:55.866 --> 26:57.567
And her halibut.

26:57.568 --> 27:00.870
Dana has a look in her eyes
where she's

27:00.871 --> 27:02.271
a little frazzled.

27:02.272 --> 27:03.706
Right behind, right behind.
I'm sorry.

27:03.707 --> 27:04.740
I'm praying.

27:04.741 --> 27:06.375
Please, lord...
My halibut.

27:06.376 --> 27:08.277
It's gotta happen now,

27:08.278 --> 27:10.746
or it's gonna be a horrible,
horrible time for us.

27:12.449 --> 27:13.583
It's good.
It's good.

27:13.584 --> 27:15.184
Halibut better now?

27:15.185 --> 27:16.786
Now tell her so she registers

27:16.787 --> 27:18.221
what you're saying.

27:18.222 --> 27:19.655
<i>Dana, you just nailed
that halibut.</i>

27:19.656 --> 27:20.423
Stay there with me, okay?

27:20.424 --> 27:21.657
Yup.

27:21.658 --> 27:23.493
Dana, Christina's first pick,

27:23.494 --> 27:24.894
is now living up
to her reputation.

27:24.895 --> 27:26.395
<i>Take it.</i>

27:26.396 --> 27:27.530
And food is flying out

27:27.531 --> 27:29.198
of the red kitchen.

27:29.199 --> 27:30.900
Very good.
Was it good?

27:30.901 --> 27:32.268
Amazing.

27:32.269 --> 27:34.003
Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

27:34.004 --> 27:35.171
No. Royce!
Look at that.

27:35.172 --> 27:36.906
No way. Come on.
Taste that.

27:36.907 --> 27:38.774
Taste that.
Come on.

27:38.775 --> 27:40.877
Justin is determined
to make sure mistakes

27:40.878 --> 27:42.678
stay in the kitchen and not
end up in the dining room.

27:42.679 --> 27:44.046
Brian, pour salt in this.

27:44.047 --> 27:45.181
Come on.
Not salty enough?

27:45.182 --> 27:46.649
No. Taste it.
me.

27:46.650 --> 27:48.651
Justin, well spotted.

27:48.652 --> 27:51.754
Unfortunately, that
means, at least for right now,

27:51.755 --> 27:53.990
he's not sending any food
at all.

27:53.991 --> 27:55.558
Royce! It's raw.
Come on.

27:55.559 --> 27:57.393
<i>Come on.
I got to refire.</i>

27:57.394 --> 27:59.595
I'm getting really frustrated
with my team.

27:59.596 --> 28:01.364
I can't physically just go do
your work for you.

28:01.365 --> 28:03.099
Rib-eye's coming, chef.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.468
You know, they're not fighting
for what I'm fighting for.

28:05.469 --> 28:07.136
I'm there.
I'm the last line of defense.

28:07.137 --> 28:09.038
I'm it, and I got to make sure

28:09.039 --> 28:10.339
that it's going out correctly.

28:12.376 --> 28:14.110
These are over, Barbie.
You got to give me

28:14.111 --> 28:15.278
two more right away.
Yes, chef.

28:15.279 --> 28:16.546
I'm not falling behind
right now.

28:16.547 --> 28:18.314
Look at 'em.
Just look

28:18.315 --> 28:20.149
at the two different steaks.
Look at 'em.

28:20.150 --> 28:21.384
All right.
Two more coming right now.

28:21.385 --> 28:22.451
Come on.
You got to give me

28:22.452 --> 28:23.619
<i>better than that.
Yes, chef.</i>

28:23.620 --> 28:25.755
Oh, God.

28:25.756 --> 28:27.790
Come on.
Get it together.

28:27.791 --> 28:29.458
Get it together.

28:29.459 --> 28:31.794
As the blue
kitchen tries to step up

28:31.795 --> 28:33.996
and meet Justin's standards...
I need... I need this out.

28:33.997 --> 28:35.498
I need it out.

28:35.499 --> 28:36.999
In the red kitchen...

28:37.000 --> 28:39.001
Order in.
Last entree.

28:39.002 --> 28:40.136
Table 64.

28:40.137 --> 28:41.737
Two crab, one scallop.

28:41.738 --> 28:44.307
One halibut,
one beef, one pork.

28:44.308 --> 28:45.808
Yes, chef.

28:45.809 --> 28:47.276
This is my last table
ever here.

28:47.277 --> 28:48.311
This is it for us, okay?

28:48.312 --> 28:49.979
Yes, chef.

28:49.980 --> 28:51.314
Christina has moved on

28:51.315 --> 28:52.448
to her final ticket.

28:52.449 --> 28:53.816
You got it, chef.
Count it down.

28:53.817 --> 28:55.351
I need to hear it.
Six minutes.

28:55.352 --> 28:56.719
<i>Six minutes.
I need my brigade</i>

28:56.720 --> 28:57.920
to finish strong.

28:57.921 --> 28:59.288
I need them to bring up

28:59.289 --> 29:01.357
this last ticket perfectly.

29:01.358 --> 29:03.526
This is the last entree
that any of us

29:03.527 --> 29:05.161
will ever cook
in Hell's Kitchen.

29:05.162 --> 29:06.562
I was just like, "whew!

29:06.563 --> 29:07.930
This is it."

29:07.931 --> 29:09.832
Christina, you want me
to walk with my beef?

29:09.833 --> 29:12.168
Yeah, walk...
yeah, bring me your beef.

29:12.169 --> 29:14.770
Beef garnish.
Dana, I need that pork.

29:14.771 --> 29:15.938
Food's dying again
in the window.

29:15.939 --> 29:16.772
Come on, guys.

29:18.976 --> 29:20.476
Stop.
It's raw in the middle.

29:20.477 --> 29:22.244
Stop now.
Raw in the middle.

29:23.547 --> 29:26.515
This cannot be happening
on the last ticket.

29:28.385 --> 29:29.919
I wish that I
could have performed

29:29.920 --> 29:31.520
better for Christina,

29:31.521 --> 29:32.688
but I just got .

29:32.689 --> 29:34.023
Such a shame.

29:34.024 --> 29:35.725
The last table.

29:35.726 --> 29:36.959
That's what really hurts me.

29:36.960 --> 29:38.561
It's your decision.

29:38.562 --> 29:40.262
You pull that back,
you start the table again,

29:40.263 --> 29:41.330
or you send that,

29:41.331 --> 29:44.166
<i>but it's your call.</i>

29:45.702 --> 29:47.837
Pull it.
I'm not sending out

29:47.838 --> 29:49.105
the last table like .

29:49.106 --> 29:51.007
There is no way in hell

29:51.008 --> 29:53.809
that I am gonna do some
on my last ticket,

29:53.810 --> 29:55.478
my last entree
in Hell's Kitchen.

29:55.479 --> 29:56.779
Christina, well done.
Thank you, chef.

29:56.780 --> 29:58.914
Let's start over,
let's start fresh,

29:58.915 --> 29:59.949
and let's do it right.

29:59.950 --> 30:01.517
Look at me, please.

30:01.518 --> 30:03.019
<i>My last table, your last table.</i>

30:03.020 --> 30:04.720
Push, push, push, push.

30:04.721 --> 30:07.023
As Christina
is forced to refire

30:07.024 --> 30:09.825
her entire last ticket
because of Dana's pork...

30:09.826 --> 30:11.027
Dana, come on.

30:11.028 --> 30:12.228
In the blue kitchen...

30:12.229 --> 30:13.796
Three rib-eyes, chef.

30:13.797 --> 30:15.765
Barbie is back in
the groove on the meat station.

30:15.766 --> 30:17.500
Barbie, rib-eye's
cooked perfectly.

30:17.501 --> 30:19.935
Thank you, chef.
Service, please.

30:19.936 --> 30:22.571
And entrees are once
again leaving the blue kitchen.

30:22.572 --> 30:24.407
The rib-eye's
perfectly seasoned.

30:24.408 --> 30:25.641
Fantastic.

30:25.642 --> 30:27.309
Listen.
Listen, guys.

30:27.310 --> 30:29.011
<i>It's the last table.
Yes.</i>

30:29.012 --> 30:30.346
This is the last time
you're gonna be cooking

30:30.347 --> 30:31.280
in this kitchen.
Let's go.

30:31.281 --> 30:32.314
Justin is back on the road

30:32.315 --> 30:33.516
to the finish line.

30:33.517 --> 30:34.917
Can you walk these,
honey, please?

30:34.918 --> 30:36.152
Yes, I can walk them for you.
Thank you.

30:39.523 --> 30:41.490
But unfortunately...
Come on.

30:41.491 --> 30:42.925
He now has to take a detour.

30:42.926 --> 30:44.226
<i>Barbie.</i>

30:44.227 --> 30:45.528
Come on.
Come on.

30:45.529 --> 30:46.962
You're better than that.
Come on.

30:46.963 --> 30:49.098
Come on, look at that.
It's overcooked.

30:49.099 --> 30:51.734
My steaks
just keep overcooking,

30:51.735 --> 30:53.335
and I'm like...

30:53.336 --> 30:55.171
What?

30:55.172 --> 30:57.173
I'm running out
of everything.

30:57.174 --> 30:59.041
<i>I need those
right now, Barbie.</i>

30:59.042 --> 30:59.542
Right now,
I need those rib-eye.

30:59.543 --> 31:00.710
We're dying here.

31:00.711 --> 31:02.545
I'm just literally watching
my dreams

31:02.546 --> 31:04.680
just sink right now.
I really need 'em right now.

31:04.681 --> 31:06.549
Please help me
get through this service.

31:06.550 --> 31:09.018
Three rib-eye.

31:09.019 --> 31:11.120
me.

31:11.121 --> 31:12.755
Barbie, Barbie, Barbie.

31:12.756 --> 31:14.957
Oh, !
Come on.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.892
Right away.

31:16.893 --> 31:18.861
All right, we got a problem.

31:18.862 --> 31:22.798
All of a sudden,
I hear Barbie has a big problem.

31:22.799 --> 31:24.400
I don't have
two rib-eyes.

31:24.401 --> 31:26.268
What?

31:26.269 --> 31:28.904
<i>Barbie, just tell him, man.</i>

31:28.905 --> 31:29.905
<i>Tell him.</i>

31:29.906 --> 31:31.907
<i>Come on.
Barbie.</i>

31:31.908 --> 31:33.976
We're short two rib-eye now.
Get 'em on.

31:33.977 --> 31:35.411
I don't have two more rib-eye.

31:35.412 --> 31:37.646
hell.
Come on, guys.

31:37.647 --> 31:39.548
Oh, come on.
hell, guys.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.450
<i>It's the last table.
Come on.</i>

31:41.451 --> 31:43.452
Barbie, really?
Are you really telling me that?

31:43.453 --> 31:45.454
<i>I need this food,
and I need it right now.</i>

31:45.455 --> 31:47.423
Right now.

31:54.128 --> 31:56.262
It's two hours
into the dinner service

31:56.263 --> 31:58.832
that will decide
who will be chef Ramsay's

31:58.833 --> 32:01.534
new head chef
in his Vegas restaurant.

32:01.535 --> 32:03.503
But with Dana's
undercooked pork,

32:03.504 --> 32:06.806
Christina was forced to refire
her entire final ticket.

32:06.807 --> 32:08.308
I'm gonna pull it.

32:08.309 --> 32:10.076
I'm not sending out
the last table like .

32:10.077 --> 32:11.277
And in the blue kitchen...

32:11.278 --> 32:13.013
Barbie, Barbie, Barbie.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.814
Oh, .

32:14.815 --> 32:17.283
Thanks to Barbie's
wildly inconsistent performance

32:17.284 --> 32:18.918
on the meat station...

32:18.919 --> 32:20.253
We're short
two rib-eye now.

32:20.254 --> 32:21.721
Get 'em on.
Get 'em on.

32:21.722 --> 32:24.024
I don't have two more rib-eye.
hell.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.859
Come on, guys.

32:25.860 --> 32:27.861
Justin's final
ticket isn't going any better.

32:27.862 --> 32:29.295
James.
James.

32:29.296 --> 32:31.965
James.
Chef.

32:31.966 --> 32:33.533
I'm short
two rib-eyes now.

32:33.534 --> 32:35.035
I can do a filet if you want.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.336
Send the filet instead.

32:36.337 --> 32:37.937
There's so much pressure.

32:37.938 --> 32:40.006
I really want
to help Justin win.

32:40.007 --> 32:44.411
But that steak...
oh, I hate rib-eyes now!

32:44.412 --> 32:45.845
I hate rib-eyes.

32:45.846 --> 32:47.914
<i>Push right now!</i>

32:47.915 --> 32:50.250
James, that's okay?
The filet instead of rib-eye?

32:50.251 --> 32:51.751
Yeah, perfect.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.653
Justin.
Yes, chef.

32:53.654 --> 32:55.555
You're both now...
look at me...

32:55.556 --> 32:57.190
on your last tickets.
Yes, chef.

32:57.191 --> 32:58.558
Send this last table out

32:58.559 --> 32:59.859
like the first table.
Come on.

32:59.860 --> 33:01.127
Yes, chef. Come on.

33:01.128 --> 33:02.062
<i>This is it.</i>

33:02.063 --> 33:03.530
Barbie, two filet.

33:03.531 --> 33:05.265
<i>Right now. Push.
Yes, chef. Yes, chef.</i>

33:05.266 --> 33:06.533
Talk to me, Dana.

33:06.534 --> 33:09.102
I got 45 seconds on the pork.

33:09.103 --> 33:10.570
Walk with it.
Walk with it.

33:10.571 --> 33:11.771
I'll meet you in the window.

33:11.772 --> 33:12.939
If there's ever a time
I need you,

33:12.940 --> 33:13.973
<i>it's right now.
Come on!</i>

33:13.974 --> 33:15.141
<i>Let's go.
Let's go.</i>

33:15.142 --> 33:17.043
<i>Barbie, perfect.</i>

33:17.044 --> 33:19.179
Come on, Dana.
Look right in the middle.

33:19.180 --> 33:21.481
It's perfect.
Server, please.

33:21.482 --> 33:23.783
While both
chefs had their setbacks,

33:23.784 --> 33:25.685
the worthy finalists
fought through them

33:25.686 --> 33:27.587
and are now serving
their final tables.

33:27.588 --> 33:29.022
Oh, wow, that's really good.

33:29.023 --> 33:31.257
So good. Really good. Wow.

33:31.258 --> 33:33.193
And are receiving rave reviews.

33:33.194 --> 33:34.894
You think you're gonna get
good cuisine,

33:34.895 --> 33:36.463
but it's, like,
out-of-this-world cuisine.

33:36.464 --> 33:38.198
Good job, guys.
Thank you.

33:38.199 --> 33:39.499
I worked my ass off for you.
Thank you. I know.

33:39.500 --> 33:40.900
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

33:40.901 --> 33:42.268
I know I put it
all out there tonight.

33:42.269 --> 33:43.870
I did.
I did the best that I could.

33:43.871 --> 33:45.839
And I am so proud of my team.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.607
So I feel great right now.

33:47.608 --> 33:49.242
Thank you so much.

33:49.243 --> 33:50.543
You got it.
Thank you.

33:50.544 --> 33:52.512
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.

33:54.081 --> 33:55.682
What a journey.
I can't believe...

33:55.683 --> 33:57.016
I really can't believe
it's over.

33:57.017 --> 33:58.952
I feel good
about what I did out there.

33:58.953 --> 34:00.553
And I know I gave everything
I could possibly give.

34:00.554 --> 34:04.090
Thanks, brother.
Love you.

34:04.091 --> 34:06.726
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

34:09.096 --> 34:11.397
That was an amazing service.
You know that.

34:11.398 --> 34:12.431
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:12.433 --> 34:13.632
<i>That was amazing.</i>

34:13.634 --> 34:15.135
<i>Really good job.
Seriously.</i>

34:15.136 --> 34:16.703
Really good job indeed.

34:16.704 --> 34:19.239
And on the back of that,
I'm changing things.

34:21.141 --> 34:23.208
For the first time ever,
I've decided

34:23.210 --> 34:26.079
to do away
with the whole two-door thing.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.248
Because I'm ready to decide
a winner.

34:29.250 --> 34:34.254
<i>The winner of Hell's Kitchen
is...</i>

34:35.418 --> 34:36.255
Tavon.

34:37.958 --> 34:40.025
Hey, you...
"Executive chef."

34:40.027 --> 34:41.694
I guess I froze.
I mean...

34:41.695 --> 34:42.962
You froze?

34:42.963 --> 34:44.630
What else... what else
do you want me to say?

34:44.632 --> 34:46.199
You haven't
even defrosted.

34:51.804 --> 34:53.306
I knew it!

34:55.342 --> 34:57.677
<i>Justin, Christina, relax.</i>

34:57.678 --> 34:59.112
Come on.

34:59.113 --> 35:01.314
Okay, seriously, both of you...

35:01.315 --> 35:03.082
<i>Head up to the dorms,</i>

35:03.083 --> 35:04.617
and I will call you both

35:04.618 --> 35:06.419
<i>when I'm ready
with my decision.</i>

35:06.420 --> 35:08.922
Off you go.

35:08.923 --> 35:10.490
Thanks, guys.
All right, chef.

35:10.491 --> 35:13.426
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

35:13.427 --> 35:14.627
Guys, thanks again.

35:14.628 --> 35:16.129
<i>It's been a roller coaster,</i>

35:16.130 --> 35:17.530
and you gave me everything you
had tonight.

35:17.531 --> 35:19.499
I appreciate that.
I'll see you guys later.

35:19.500 --> 35:20.800
<i>Yes? Well done.
Yes, chef.</i>

35:20.801 --> 35:21.701
Thank you.

35:21.702 --> 35:23.169
Thank you, chef.

35:23.170 --> 35:25.338
If I win this competition,
I mean,

35:25.339 --> 35:26.839
this will be, you know,

35:26.840 --> 35:29.742
the biggest life-changing event
ever.

35:29.743 --> 35:31.077
Oh, man.

35:31.078 --> 35:32.212
It's overwhelming.

35:32.213 --> 35:34.113
Wow.

35:34.114 --> 35:36.282
My whole life
is riding on this right now.

35:36.283 --> 35:38.151
I want to win this thing
more than anything in the world,

35:38.152 --> 35:39.686
but I hope I did as good
as I feel like I did,

35:39.687 --> 35:41.521
'cause I felt
like I did a great job.

35:41.522 --> 35:43.122
After reviewing

35:43.123 --> 35:44.824
all of the customer
comment cards

35:44.825 --> 35:46.659
and weighing everything
that Justin

35:46.660 --> 35:48.995
and Christina have accomplished
in Hell's Kitchen,

35:48.996 --> 35:50.763
chef Ramsay
is having a difficult time

35:50.764 --> 35:52.974
with the decision.

35:54.802 --> 35:56.135
Wow.

35:56.136 --> 35:57.604
That's delicious.
Thank you, chef.

35:57.605 --> 35:59.005
<i>I mean, really delicious.</i>

35:59.006 --> 36:00.206
My biggest problem...
I want to eat more.

36:00.207 --> 36:01.574
<i>Thank you.
Great job indeed.</i>

36:01.575 --> 36:04.244
He's got pasta.
You've got pasta.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.846
off out of here.
hell.

36:06.847 --> 36:09.582
Justin gets this right,
it's over.

36:09.583 --> 36:10.917
Come on.
Sunchoke.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.553
<i>Yeah!
Never before has anyone</i>

36:13.554 --> 36:14.721
<i>gotten a perfect score.</i>

36:14.722 --> 36:16.356
Amazing.
Royce.

36:16.357 --> 36:17.857
Royce, it's dry.

36:17.858 --> 36:19.726
Come on, you got to give me
better than that.

36:19.727 --> 36:21.294
Come on, these people want
to eat. Let's go.

36:21.295 --> 36:22.428
Crab in my hand, chef.
Come on, man.

36:22.429 --> 36:23.963
Good, Justin.
Thank you, chef.

36:23.964 --> 36:24.998
<i>Very good indeed.</i>

36:27.401 --> 36:28.835
Yay!

36:28.836 --> 36:30.837
Our first three-star.
Christina, great job.

36:30.838 --> 36:33.172
Thank you, chef.
What is this?

36:33.173 --> 36:34.240
From you.

36:34.241 --> 36:35.708
<i>I held it back here...
no!</i>

36:35.709 --> 36:37.210
Look at it!

36:37.211 --> 36:39.512
I had a strip and sea bass,
vip.

36:39.513 --> 36:41.714
<i>Follow me
with that sauce, Royce.</i>

36:41.715 --> 36:43.416
Uh, ladies, that's one of the
best services you've ever had.

36:43.417 --> 36:45.485
Thank you, chef.
Good job.

36:45.486 --> 36:47.420
It's your decision...
you pull that back,

36:47.421 --> 36:49.589
you start the table again,
or you send that.

36:49.590 --> 36:51.724
Pull it.

36:51.725 --> 36:54.060
I'm not sending out
the last table like .

36:54.061 --> 36:55.361
<i>Christina, well done.
Thank you, chef.</i>

36:59.800 --> 37:03.136
Let's go.

37:03.137 --> 37:04.737
Hello?
Justin?

37:04.738 --> 37:06.606
Yes.
Would you and Christina please

37:06.607 --> 37:08.508
come to my office?
I've made a decision.

37:08.509 --> 37:10.677
It was chef.
We're going.

37:10.678 --> 37:12.211
Okay, here we go.

37:12.212 --> 37:14.080
This is it.

37:14.081 --> 37:15.415
I'm actually reminding myself
to breathe

37:15.416 --> 37:16.916
at this point.

37:16.917 --> 37:19.185
It's a little bit
nerve-racking.

37:21.221 --> 37:23.990
You were both amazing leaders
tonight.

37:23.991 --> 37:25.858
<i>A phenomenal job.
Well done.</i>

37:25.859 --> 37:27.393
Thank you, chef.

37:27.394 --> 37:29.762
Christina, I don't think
I have ever met

37:29.763 --> 37:31.331
a more passionate chef.

37:31.332 --> 37:33.366
Thank you, chef.

37:33.367 --> 37:35.068
Justin.
Yes, chef.

37:35.069 --> 37:37.136
You have
an extraordinary palate.

37:37.137 --> 37:40.039
I mean, a unique gift.
A natural gift.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.107
Thank you, chef.

37:41.108 --> 37:43.443
I have no doubt in my mind

37:43.444 --> 37:44.644
that both of you

37:44.645 --> 37:46.846
<i>will have successful careers.</i>

37:46.847 --> 37:48.681
After a great deal of thought,

37:48.682 --> 37:51.784
I have come to a decision.

37:51.785 --> 37:54.187
<i>Christina, Justin,</i>

37:54.188 --> 37:55.855
please step up to your doors.

37:55.856 --> 37:58.091
I want this more

37:58.092 --> 38:00.193
than I've pretty much wanted
anything in my life.

38:00.194 --> 38:01.627
It's the first time
I've really been nervous

38:01.628 --> 38:03.229
in this whole competition.

38:03.230 --> 38:04.597
It's intense standing in front

38:04.598 --> 38:05.498
of that door.

38:05.499 --> 38:06.833
Looking at that handle,

38:06.834 --> 38:08.634
wanting it to turn, you know,

38:08.635 --> 38:11.504
I have complete chills
all over my body.

38:22.983 --> 38:26.319
<i>The chef whose door opens</i>

38:26.320 --> 38:28.321
<i>will become the winner
of Hell's Kitchen</i>

38:28.322 --> 38:31.891
and become the head chef
at Gordon Ramsay Steak,

38:31.892 --> 38:33.626
Paris, Las Vegas,

38:33.627 --> 38:36.763
<i>with a salary of $1/4 million.</i>

38:36.764 --> 38:38.464
Christina and Justin,

38:38.465 --> 38:40.900
very carefully place your hand

38:40.901 --> 38:44.904
<i>on top of the handle.</i>

38:44.905 --> 38:46.439
Christina and Justin,
are you ready?

38:46.440 --> 38:47.740
Yes, chef.

38:47.741 --> 38:49.409
On the count of three,

38:49.410 --> 38:52.011
turn your handle.

38:56.550 --> 38:58.551
One...

39:00.988 --> 39:02.922
Two...

39:06.593 --> 39:09.729
Three.

39:23.953 --> 39:25.620
Christina and Justin,
are you ready?

39:25.621 --> 39:26.721
Yes, chef.

39:26.722 --> 39:28.389
On the count of three,

39:28.390 --> 39:32.093
turn your handle.

39:32.094 --> 39:35.597
One...

39:35.598 --> 39:38.199
Two...

39:42.605 --> 39:45.139
<i>Three.</i>

39:50.679 --> 39:52.714
Oh, .

40:02.625 --> 40:04.759
Yeah!

40:04.760 --> 40:06.427
Oh, my God.

40:06.428 --> 40:08.296
It feels so good.

40:08.297 --> 40:09.731
It's totally amazing.

40:09.732 --> 40:12.567
I can barely feel
my body right now.

40:15.104 --> 40:17.038
It's so completely
overwhelming.

40:17.039 --> 40:19.273
I'm trying to hold on
to every second of it here.

40:23.145 --> 40:25.513
You did a great job.
Thanks, chef.

40:25.514 --> 40:27.015
Great job.
Thank you.

40:27.016 --> 40:28.516
The toughest thing
I ever had in my life,

40:28.517 --> 40:29.484
honestly,
was holding that door knob

40:29.485 --> 40:30.785
and not having it open.

40:30.786 --> 40:33.054
But I know I gave everything
I could possibly give.

40:33.055 --> 40:34.489
I have no regrets.

40:34.490 --> 40:36.057
Man, this is
the most amazing experience

40:36.058 --> 40:36.991
of my life,
even though I didn't win.

40:36.992 --> 40:38.326
Justin!

40:38.327 --> 40:39.694
Justin!

40:45.000 --> 40:46.868
I didn't want
to lose to anybody,

40:46.869 --> 40:48.636
but obviously
Christina's a great competitor.

40:48.637 --> 40:50.905
She's focused,
and she's a great chef.

40:50.906 --> 40:53.441
You know, to be honest with you,
if I lost to anybody else

40:53.442 --> 40:56.611
besides Christina, I would have
probably walked out of here.

40:56.612 --> 40:58.513
But, man, it would have been
great to open that door.

40:58.514 --> 41:00.048
You do what you got to do next.

41:00.049 --> 41:02.016
Well done, well done, well done,
well done, well done.

41:02.017 --> 41:03.151
Well done.

41:03.152 --> 41:06.187
I'm incredibly proud of myself

41:06.188 --> 41:09.090
and just thankful
that I have left my mark here.

41:09.091 --> 41:10.925
<i>Yay, Christina!</i>

41:10.926 --> 41:13.461
I am excited to go out to Vegas

41:13.462 --> 41:15.730
and keep pushing
that bar higher and higher

41:15.731 --> 41:19.200
until I... until I
touch the stars.

41:19.201 --> 41:21.536
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:21.537 --> 41:23.971
<i>let's hear it for Hell's Kitchen
winner Christina.</i>

41:23.972 --> 41:25.940
Incredible.

41:34.616 --> 41:36.350
Christina's passion and talent

41:36.351 --> 41:37.752
are undeniable.

41:37.753 --> 41:39.453
She's a strong leader
who is totally at home

41:39.454 --> 41:40.454
in the kitchen.

41:40.455 --> 41:43.252
I know I'm not rolling a dice
with her in Vegas,

41:43.253 --> 41:45.507
because she is the real deal.

41:46.124 --> 41:47.551
Good job.
