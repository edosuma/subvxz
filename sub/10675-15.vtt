♪♪

00:10.801 --> 00:13.304
( text alert chimes )

00:15.806 --> 00:18.939
Um, Oliver, why did you
just send me a text

00:18.939 --> 00:22.483
that says I make you feel
all tingly inside?

00:22.483 --> 00:24.695
What?

00:24.695 --> 00:26.697
No, that wasn't meant
for you.

00:26.697 --> 00:28.489
It was for Skylar.

00:28.489 --> 00:30.571
It's my big thumbs,
I'm cursed.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.495
Since it's out in the open,

00:34.495 --> 00:37.708
I say we all discuss
this tingly feeling.

00:37.708 --> 00:39.370
I say we don't.

00:40.921 --> 00:43.334
Uh, guys,

00:43.334 --> 00:45.256
I think I just discovered
another super power

00:45.256 --> 00:47.668
I got from
the Arcturian. Look.

00:50.171 --> 00:52.133
Oh, cool!

00:52.133 --> 00:53.804
Flashlight hands.

00:53.804 --> 00:57.598
Why would I need
flashlights in my hands?

00:57.598 --> 00:58.889
Because if they were
in your feet,

00:58.889 --> 01:00.561
they wouldn't be
as useful.

01:02.022 --> 01:04.735
Actually, could you shine
those bad boys over here?

01:04.735 --> 01:06.737
I think I lost a peanut.

01:08.239 --> 01:10.321
Super powers are supposed
to be cool.

01:10.321 --> 01:12.653
This is just lame.

01:12.653 --> 01:14.785
Bree, your new power
may seem lame,

01:14.785 --> 01:17.908
and absolutely hysterical,

01:17.908 --> 01:21.041
but trust me,
there must be a purpose.

01:21.041 --> 01:22.913
A big part of being
a superhero

01:22.913 --> 01:24.415
is getting used to
your powers

01:24.415 --> 01:26.006
and knowing how
and when to use them.

01:26.006 --> 01:28.919
Don't worry.
You'll figure it out.

01:32.383 --> 01:33.844
What's wrong, Douglas?

01:33.844 --> 01:36.517
Something strange is
going on outside.

01:36.517 --> 01:38.389
The whole city
feels eerie.

01:38.389 --> 01:40.811
There are a lot more
police sirens than usual.

01:40.811 --> 01:41.932
What do you think it is?

01:41.932 --> 01:43.774
I don't know.

01:43.774 --> 01:45.436
But something's
definitely not right.

01:47.938 --> 01:50.901
- Hi, guys. Meet
my new friend, Reese.
- Hi.

01:50.901 --> 01:54.155
She's a girl!

01:54.155 --> 01:57.408
And she's holding
your hand.

01:57.408 --> 02:00.541
I agree, Douglas.
Something definitely
is not right.

02:47.378 --> 02:50.090
( sirens wailing )

02:50.090 --> 02:51.712
Douglas was right.

02:51.712 --> 02:53.384
Those sirens are
really loud out there.

02:53.384 --> 02:54.675
Yeah, I'm a little
more concerned

02:54.675 --> 02:56.967
about what's going
on in here.

02:56.967 --> 03:01.512
So how exactly did
you two meet?

03:01.512 --> 03:03.724
Or are you here
against your will?

03:03.724 --> 03:07.017
Blink twice if you need me
to step in.

03:07.017 --> 03:08.979
Well, I was at the library

03:08.979 --> 03:11.111
looking for a bit of light
reading on quantum physics...

03:11.111 --> 03:14.655
Oh, my head hurts just hearing
those words in a sentence.

03:14.655 --> 03:18.028
When I noticed that Reese here
was writing a term paper

03:18.028 --> 03:20.661
on the poly-exclusion
principle.

03:20.661 --> 03:23.664
Stop! You're
burning my brain!

03:23.664 --> 03:27.538
I thought he was cute,
so I said hi.

03:27.538 --> 03:30.541
And three hours later,
we're dating.

03:30.541 --> 03:32.883
- You just met.
- We're dating!

03:33.924 --> 03:36.677
Dude, bring it
down a notch.

03:36.677 --> 03:40.140
You gotta play it smooth
and slow with the ladies.

03:40.140 --> 03:42.182
- Too much.
- Okay.

03:43.554 --> 03:45.606
Reese, why don't you
get to know everybody

03:45.606 --> 03:47.898
while I go
make us a snack

03:50.691 --> 03:52.353
Isn't he cute?

03:52.353 --> 03:54.154
Who?

03:54.154 --> 03:56.697
Chase.

03:56.697 --> 03:59.740
( giggles )
I'm worried about you.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.323
I just can't stand
being so far away from him.

04:02.323 --> 04:04.455
- He's right--
- I know where he is.

04:04.455 --> 04:06.126
I just miss him.

04:07.328 --> 04:09.420
I'm back.

04:09.420 --> 04:12.042
- Thank you, pookie bear.
- Oh, you're welcome,
pookie bear.

04:12.042 --> 04:13.334
Who's a good little
pookie bear?

04:13.334 --> 04:15.005
I'm a good little
pookie bear.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.007
Okay. All right.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.089
I can't watch this
anymore.

04:19.089 --> 04:21.762
Bree, can you burn my retinas
with your flashlight hands?

04:24.555 --> 04:27.848
Can I have a word
with you guys?

04:27.848 --> 04:28.979
In private.

04:28.979 --> 04:29.890
Absolutely.

04:31.231 --> 04:34.355
Would you excuse us,
pookie bear?

04:34.355 --> 04:37.358
I told you something
weird was going on.

04:37.358 --> 04:40.361
I was just watching
the Channel 5 news
with Chip and Dixie,

04:40.361 --> 04:44.244
and they said strange
things have been happening
all over the city.

04:44.244 --> 04:45.786
What kind of strange things,

04:45.786 --> 04:47.668
aside from the cutesie twins
over here,

04:47.668 --> 04:50.541
and people calling themselves
Chip and Dixie?

04:50.541 --> 04:52.833
Fires, ruptured gas lines,

04:52.833 --> 04:54.585
all sorts of random
destruction.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.296
And get this.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.379
Eyewitnesses are saying
it all started

04:58.379 --> 05:00.841
with a mysterious
black swarm.

05:00.841 --> 05:04.054
Hey, we know
a mysterious black swarm.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.306
Oh.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.519
Roman and Riker.

05:08.519 --> 05:10.601
Hold on. Let's not
jump to conclusions.

05:10.601 --> 05:12.693
It is tornado season.

05:14.104 --> 05:16.697
You're not the only one
who watches Chip and Dixie.

05:18.399 --> 05:20.531
Roman and Riker must be
changing up their strategy.

05:20.531 --> 05:23.203
Instead of attacking us,
they're attacking the people
of Centium City.

05:23.203 --> 05:25.406
Why?

05:25.406 --> 05:28.449
Because they couldn't
get our list of
the superheroes' locations.

05:28.449 --> 05:30.711
Instead of fighting
the superheroes themselves,

05:30.711 --> 05:32.713
I bet they're trying
to lure them out

05:32.713 --> 05:34.415
by using innocent
civilians as bait.

05:34.415 --> 05:36.216
I better go down and use
the encrypted network

05:36.216 --> 05:37.588
to warn the superheroes.

05:40.260 --> 05:41.722
What was that?

05:44.224 --> 05:46.467
The whole city
just went dark.

05:46.467 --> 05:49.930
Don't just stand there.
Turn on your flashlight hands.

05:51.181 --> 05:53.063
This isn't good.

05:53.063 --> 05:55.025
You guys need to suit up
and get moving.

05:55.025 --> 05:56.276
Got it.

05:56.276 --> 05:58.689
Whatever you do,
do not let her leave.

06:01.151 --> 06:04.154
I mean, it's really
dangerous out there.

06:04.154 --> 06:06.196
You should probably
stay here with Douglas.

06:06.196 --> 06:07.327
Okay.

06:07.327 --> 06:09.199
All righty then.

06:09.199 --> 06:10.951
( whispers )
Do not let her leave.

06:14.705 --> 06:16.587
( text alert chimes )

06:16.587 --> 06:21.381
Oliver, care to explain
why you just invited me

06:21.381 --> 06:25.175
to a post-mission
cuddle session?

06:25.175 --> 06:27.768
( groans )
Stupid thumbs.

06:28.929 --> 06:30.721
Can you forward that
to Skylar?

06:36.977 --> 06:40.070
( sirens wailing,
electricity crackling )

06:42.072 --> 06:46.286
Roman and Riker trashed
the entire city.

06:46.286 --> 06:49.159
Yeah, yeah, quit yapping
and let's find 'em already

06:49.159 --> 06:51.371
so I can get back
to Reese.

06:51.371 --> 06:55.496
- You barely even--
- We are dating!

06:55.496 --> 06:58.799
Yes, Chase, because
getting you back to
your crazy girlfriend

06:58.799 --> 07:01.171
should be everyone's
top priority right now.

07:02.132 --> 07:04.214
Actually, it probably
should be.

07:04.214 --> 07:05.966
It might not
ever happen again.

07:05.966 --> 07:10.220
( people screaming )

07:10.220 --> 07:13.143
Guys, I hear the swarm.
Everyone get ready.

07:15.145 --> 07:17.558
It sounds like they're coming
from every direction.

07:17.558 --> 07:19.439
Where are they?

07:25.736 --> 07:28.198
Well, I think
we found 'em.

07:35.375 --> 07:38.078
So...

07:38.078 --> 07:41.842
Chip and Dixie say
there's a new panda at the zoo.

07:43.924 --> 07:47.137
You know, we can just
sit in silence if you want.

07:47.137 --> 07:48.759
Oh, thank you.

07:51.932 --> 07:54.645
Douglas! Who's the tween?

07:54.645 --> 07:56.727
Did you make another one?

07:56.727 --> 07:58.979
No.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.401
It's Chase's girlfriend.

08:01.401 --> 08:03.103
Yikes. What bet
did you lose?

08:04.525 --> 08:06.366
I saw the news.

08:06.366 --> 08:09.029
The city is being overrun
by a giant swarm.

08:09.029 --> 08:11.371
I'm scared, Dougie.

08:11.371 --> 08:14.284
And now I'm scared.

08:14.284 --> 08:16.326
The team is out
taking care of it.

08:16.326 --> 08:17.878
But what if they don't?

08:17.878 --> 08:19.830
What if they
never come back?

08:19.830 --> 08:22.212
Then you and I will have
this giant penthouse

08:22.212 --> 08:23.834
all to ourselves.

08:23.834 --> 08:27.217
And just like that,
I'm rootin' for the bad guys.

08:28.889 --> 08:30.891
I'm gonna go up to
the roof and turn on
the emergency generator

08:30.891 --> 08:32.723
to get some light in here.

08:32.723 --> 08:34.474
I'll go with you.

08:34.474 --> 08:36.637
I once had a dream
that we were up on the roof.

08:36.637 --> 08:39.600
Two young babes
under a blanket of stars.

08:39.600 --> 08:43.023
Sounds nice.
Did I jump?

08:43.023 --> 08:45.525
Just stay here with Reese
till I get back.

08:48.198 --> 08:52.112
Look at us, two pretty gals
in the big city,

08:52.112 --> 08:54.494
awaiting our
gentlemen callers.

08:56.076 --> 08:59.249
We should give each other
makeovers and surprise our guys.

08:59.249 --> 09:01.371
- No, no, that's--
- I know what you're thinking.

09:01.371 --> 09:05.375
How could I get any more
beautiful, right?

09:05.375 --> 09:10.090
Well, if I'm being honest,
the makeover is more for you

09:10.090 --> 09:12.552
than it is for me.
Come on.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.976
Oh, I'm gonna make you
look so glamorous.

09:18.939 --> 09:21.892
( people screaming )

09:21.892 --> 09:23.684
We gotta get
these people outta here.

09:23.684 --> 09:25.355
Bree, look out.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.285
I don't get it.

09:35.285 --> 09:36.657
How can they be causing
so much damage?

09:36.657 --> 09:38.659
There's only two of them.

09:40.961 --> 09:42.292
KAZ: I got this one.

09:51.672 --> 09:55.345
I didn't know that Roman
and Riker's swarm could split up

09:55.345 --> 09:57.848
and be in different places
at the same time.

09:57.848 --> 09:59.389
It can't.

09:59.389 --> 10:02.983
Guys, we're not just
fighting Roman and Riker.

10:02.983 --> 10:05.485
We're fighting
multiple shape shifters.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.293
Okay, there are
too many of them.

10:23.293 --> 10:25.545
We need to call
the other superheroes
for backup.

10:25.545 --> 10:28.508
No way. That's exactly what
Roman and Riker want us to do.

10:28.508 --> 10:31.712
I'm sure they're planning
an even bigger attack
when the superheroes show up.

10:34.675 --> 10:38.468
We need to concentrate on
taking out one swarm at a time.

10:38.468 --> 10:41.521
- But how?
- Oh, maybe Bree
can distract 'em

10:41.521 --> 10:44.064
- with her flashlight--
- Enough with
the flashlight hands.

10:47.357 --> 10:50.190
I still say we call
the other superheroes in.

10:50.190 --> 10:52.072
If these swarms
take us out,

10:52.072 --> 10:53.774
they're gonna have to
come and save the city anyway.

10:53.774 --> 10:56.907
That's why it's up to us to save
the superheroes and the city.

10:59.489 --> 11:00.490
BREE: Kaz!

11:02.542 --> 11:04.624
Skylar, we're outnumbered.

11:04.624 --> 11:07.958
It's a suicide mission.

11:10.961 --> 11:15.175
It'll be tough,
but we can do this.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.467
We are an elite force.

11:17.467 --> 11:20.010
Who's with me?

11:22.602 --> 11:26.476
If I'm going down,
I'm going down fighting.

11:27.607 --> 11:29.810
Me, too.

11:29.810 --> 11:32.272
Yep.

11:34.574 --> 11:36.236
I guess I'm in, too.

11:40.620 --> 11:43.533
Wow, you do have big thumbs.
Look at that sucker.

11:48.328 --> 11:49.920
Oh, no.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.462
SKYLAR:
What are they doing?

12:02.262 --> 12:04.224
Brace yourselves!

12:25.495 --> 12:27.868
Good work, my children.

12:27.868 --> 12:29.539
Good work.

12:35.465 --> 12:38.258
PERRY: Oh, good,
the lights are back on.

12:44.474 --> 12:46.306
Come on down, Reese.

12:46.306 --> 12:47.888
I don't want to.

12:47.888 --> 12:49.980
Get down here, girlie!

12:54.694 --> 12:56.606
I think it's
a little too much.

12:56.606 --> 12:58.899
Oh, it's a lot too much.

12:58.899 --> 13:01.281
The boys are gonna love it.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.993
Okay.

13:02.993 --> 13:05.365
I was able to turn
the generator on.

13:05.365 --> 13:06.907
- Hello, Dougie.
- ( screams )

13:08.578 --> 13:11.371
And now I'm gonna
go turn it off again.

13:12.752 --> 13:14.674
Wait. You haven't seen
the best part.

13:14.674 --> 13:16.336
I rouged my bunions.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.679
Be right back.

13:19.679 --> 13:21.181
Take your time.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.095
I've got work to do.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.097
Hyperlift, open.

13:34.644 --> 13:36.106
I'm in.

13:54.544 --> 13:56.296
Who are you?

13:56.296 --> 13:58.838
I recognize him
from Mighty Med.

13:58.838 --> 14:02.382
It's Roman
and Riker's
father, Rodissius.

14:02.382 --> 14:05.555
They had to take away
his powers to save his life.

14:05.555 --> 14:08.468
Hey, I've been
meaning to ask you.

14:10.390 --> 14:12.472
Isn't it a pain writing
your name out all the time?

14:12.472 --> 14:14.274
Wouldn't it just be
easier to go by Rod?

14:16.606 --> 14:18.939
No.

14:18.939 --> 14:21.401
Rodissius it is.

14:23.653 --> 14:26.406
I see that your little
Elite Force

14:26.406 --> 14:28.949
has finally realized
you're no match

14:28.949 --> 14:31.201
for my family
of shape shifters.

14:31.201 --> 14:34.794
Family? How many kids
do you have?

14:34.794 --> 14:36.756
Thirteen.

14:36.756 --> 14:39.589
Believe me, Roman
and Riker are the nice ones.

14:39.589 --> 14:42.632
What does that say
about you as a father?

14:46.846 --> 14:50.220
You can attack this city
all you want.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.222
But no amount of destruction

14:52.222 --> 14:54.975
will ever bring
your powers back.

14:54.975 --> 14:58.688
And to be honest,
you don't deserve them.

14:58.688 --> 15:02.902
I may not have my powers,
but my children do.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.614
And as you can see,

15:04.614 --> 15:07.327
they're getting plenty
of revenge for me.

15:07.327 --> 15:09.619
They're attacking
innocent people.

15:09.619 --> 15:11.531
I know.

15:11.531 --> 15:12.702
Isn't it great?

15:12.702 --> 15:15.085
Look, Rod.
See?

15:15.085 --> 15:16.706
It's got a nice
ring to it.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.670
We're on to your plan.

15:20.670 --> 15:24.424
You're attacking these people
to lure the superheroes out.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.257
Yeah, but it's not
gonna work,

15:27.257 --> 15:29.849
because we're gonna
take you down on our own.

15:29.849 --> 15:32.682
( laughing )

15:32.682 --> 15:37.437
You think we're trying
to lure the superheroes here.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.820
No. Our plan is a little more
complex than that.

15:40.820 --> 15:42.482
How so?

15:42.482 --> 15:44.904
We didn't have to bring
the superheroes here.

15:46.276 --> 15:50.570
We just had to get you
away from your cyber desk.

15:51.911 --> 15:54.574
There's someone
in the house.

15:55.835 --> 15:57.457
Reese.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.540
No. No way.

16:00.540 --> 16:02.712
She wouldn't betray me.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.504
I think she would.

16:04.504 --> 16:06.926
After all,
she is my daughter.

16:06.926 --> 16:09.509
What?!

16:09.509 --> 16:11.721
I thought I would have
to work a little harder

16:11.721 --> 16:14.724
to trick the smartest man
in the world.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.597
Come on. We have to get
back before she gets

16:17.597 --> 16:20.810
- that superhero list.
- ( Rodissius laughs )

16:23.773 --> 16:28.068
( laughter continues )

16:35.785 --> 16:37.537
Well, what do you want?

16:39.749 --> 16:43.083
Nobody messes with
my brother.

16:56.846 --> 17:01.191
Yeah! How do you like
them flashlight hands, huh?

17:01.191 --> 17:03.313
Bree!

17:03.313 --> 17:06.486
Oh... ( chuckles )
Hey.

17:06.486 --> 17:08.148
How did you...

17:08.148 --> 17:11.241
I'm not gonna lie.
That was a total accident.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.749
Where is it?

17:19.749 --> 17:22.462
Ah, there we go.
Got it.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.927
Come on.
Hurry up and download.

17:27.927 --> 17:29.969
PERRY: Wait.
There's more to my makeover.

17:29.969 --> 17:33.052
I painted all my toes to look
like our future children.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.845
You know the rules.
No kids in mission command.

17:41.351 --> 17:43.393
Reese.

17:43.393 --> 17:46.025
What are you doing?

17:46.025 --> 17:50.990
Uh, I was just looking for
a good Wi-Fi connection.

17:50.990 --> 17:53.363
How did you even know
this was down here?

17:54.614 --> 17:57.537
That's the superhero list.

17:57.537 --> 17:58.908
What are you up to?

18:01.040 --> 18:02.041
What the...

18:08.588 --> 18:12.212
Why?

18:12.212 --> 18:15.805
Just completing a mission
my brothers couldn't.

18:15.805 --> 18:18.097
Wait. So you're...

18:18.097 --> 18:20.059
Roman and Riker's sister.

18:20.059 --> 18:24.814
Their more...
powerful sister.

18:26.186 --> 18:28.818
( screaming )

18:34.654 --> 18:36.446
Did you feel the burn?

18:39.449 --> 18:41.120
When you come to,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.623
you'll have a permanent
reminder of what kind of power

18:43.623 --> 18:45.335
you're really
dealing with.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.058
Whether it's
breaking in here,

18:59.058 --> 19:00.720
or breaking out of
a Turkish prison,

19:00.720 --> 19:02.602
you always got my back.

19:04.814 --> 19:06.936
Dougie!

19:08.768 --> 19:11.321
What happened?

19:11.321 --> 19:13.573
I don't know. I was
chasing him all over,

19:13.573 --> 19:16.196
and when I found him down here,
he was gasping for air.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.987
Why were you chasing him?

19:17.987 --> 19:20.410
It was pretty obvious
he wasn't gonna come willingly.

19:21.991 --> 19:23.122
Go get help.

19:23.122 --> 19:25.785
Where's Reese?

19:25.785 --> 19:30.960
She took off
right after she blasted me.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.052
Douglas, I'm so sorry.

19:34.964 --> 19:37.006
She got him good.

19:37.006 --> 19:38.388
His pulse
is really weak.

19:38.388 --> 19:41.140
That's not the only
thing she got.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.803
She downloaded
the superhero list.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.977
( frustrated yell )
This is all my fault.

19:47.977 --> 19:50.480
Chase. It's okay.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.942
You got carried away
by a crush; it happens.

19:54.073 --> 19:55.735
Now they know where
all the superheroes are.

19:55.735 --> 19:57.867
We have to get on the encrypted
network and warn them.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.743
She blocked our access.
We can't even get on.

20:03.743 --> 20:07.126
I'll stay here
with Douglas.

20:07.126 --> 20:10.920
You guys head back out,
try to find Reese.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.674
If it's a war they want...

20:17.677 --> 20:19.839
then we'll give 'em one.

20:29.148 --> 20:31.561
Father, Father.

20:31.561 --> 20:33.903
- ( Rodissius groaning )
- Father?

20:37.907 --> 20:39.158
Did you get the list?

20:39.158 --> 20:41.781
Yes. The superheroes
are ours.

20:41.781 --> 20:44.364
Who did this to you?

20:44.364 --> 20:46.576
The bionic girl.

20:46.576 --> 20:49.248
She also has
super powers.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.291
How is that possible?

20:51.291 --> 20:54.083
I don't know,
but we're gonna find out.

20:54.083 --> 20:56.336
We will see this through.

20:56.336 --> 20:59.299
I want you there watching

20:59.299 --> 21:02.722
as we destroy
every last superhero,

21:02.722 --> 21:05.385
including the
Elite Force.
