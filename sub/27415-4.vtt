WEBVTT

00:27.720 --> 00:31.960
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.580
I'm gonna be a dad!

01:29.680 --> 01:33.360
I'm gonna be a dad!

02:24.160 --> 02:26.460
It's very quick,
don't you think?

02:26.560 --> 02:27.980
Yeah, of course it is.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.160
Look at us. We're superhuman.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.820
I wonder what
it's going to be,

02:33.920 --> 02:34.980
a boy or a girl.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.900
-I think it's a boy.
-A boy.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.820
Oh, boy.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.540
This is how it's meant to be.

02:41.640 --> 02:45.380
This is for us.
This is our miracle.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.160
Hey, Zacky.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.860
What were you trying to do?

03:30.960 --> 03:32.960
Scare me to death?

03:40.160 --> 03:42.560
You lied.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.820
What are you talking about?

03:46.920 --> 03:51.380
On the day of the flood,
she was driving to a clinic.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.520
No. She wasn't going there.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.860
I'll be at the church setting up
for the council meeting

04:07.960 --> 04:11.180
and then it's volunteer morning
at the care home

04:11.280 --> 04:13.300
so I should be back here
round about...

04:15.360 --> 04:17.360
Herb?

04:43.480 --> 04:46.400
Loris.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Herb?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.600
How?

06:30.320 --> 06:33.200
So you must be
Farida's granddaughter?

06:53.840 --> 06:56.440
I am whatever you wish me
to be.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.280
Slow down.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.100
Ahhh!

07:12.200 --> 07:14.500
You like to be in control,
do you?

07:22.520 --> 07:23.820
Shhh.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.380
You like to humiliate, yes

07:27.960 --> 07:29.940
You see, silence is best.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.620
That way you survive.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.140
Oops-a-daisy.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.660
Excuse me.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.760
Excuse me.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.620
Are you a relative of Farida's?

08:07.720 --> 08:11.980
I'm so sorry. Please know
the police have been contacted.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.620
The police?

08:13.720 --> 08:17.040
They'll find her.
I'm sure of it.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.120
I certainly hope so.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.800
Whole new start.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.120
-No.
-No?

09:03.320 --> 09:05.740
-Later.
-Huh?

09:05.840 --> 09:07.380
I'm heading out.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.820
Where are you going?

09:09.920 --> 09:11.660
We need more, Max.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.540
You rest up. I'll get 'em.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.140
No. I think I'd like
the fresh air.

09:17.240 --> 09:21.120
-Then we'll go together.
-I trust you.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.680
You need to trust me.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.840
You clean.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.760
I provide.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.920
Well, don't be long.

10:34.040 --> 10:36.180
Oh, shit.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.460
I don't know... I don't know
what's happened.

10:38.560 --> 10:39.900
It's OK.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
OK.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
1970?

10:48.280 --> 10:50.060
You're not that old.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.040
It's not my birthdate.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.380
Did I do something Jesus!

11:06.480 --> 11:10.600
Tina, not everything's
about you.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.020
It's just...

11:20.120 --> 11:21.660
..my kid, you know,

11:21.760 --> 11:23.940
I almost saw him burn to death
in front of me.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.580
-What?
-Mm.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.680
You have a kid?

11:30.360 --> 11:34.340
If you have a kid,
what are you doing in Mullan?

11:34.440 --> 11:37.620
I could ask you the same thing.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.900
Your sister's dead,
your husband's a dick

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
and you're fucking me.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.640
Hang on, mate, take it easy.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.280
Stop!

13:09.440 --> 13:11.780
Farida!

13:11.880 --> 13:13.880
Gwen?

13:18.840 --> 13:21.660
It's not an easy thing
to explain, is it?

13:21.760 --> 13:24.100
It's karma.

13:24.200 --> 13:28.060
Second chance to live the life
stolen from us.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.160
What do you mean, stolen?

13:31.240 --> 13:34.700
I never wanted
to come to Australia.

13:34.800 --> 13:39.080
Ranjeet said
it was only for five years.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.060
But we never went back.

13:43.160 --> 13:46.540
And I never stood up
for myself.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.340
I'm really sorry, Farida.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.600
I will not return to that place.

13:52.760 --> 13:56.420
I'm going home. To India.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.020
There, family always cares
for you.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.780
You're pregnant.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.860
Yes.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.780
That's why I need...
I need another one.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.080
Please.

14:14.840 --> 14:17.820
-They don't last.
-No.

14:17.920 --> 14:21.960
Only...a...a few days or so.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.460
And that's why
you're in my house.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.580
-To steal from me.
-No.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.780
No. I didn't... I didn't know
that you were here.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.020
I didn't know that you
needed one too.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.920
Then it looks like we both lose.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.900
I burned them.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.420
No! No, no, no, no!

14:48.520 --> 14:50.980
Ow! No. No.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.700
No. Why would you do that?

14:53.800 --> 14:56.200
I didn't know.
-No!

14:59.200 --> 15:02.440
No.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.880
So you see,
there is nothing here for you.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.640
Get out of my house.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.920
Gwen!

15:45.160 --> 15:49.560
Farida's plant's dead.
She burned it.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.060
You OK?

15:53.160 --> 15:56.020
I don't want you to hate me,
Ray.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.280
I could never hate you.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.760
You didn't want this.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.880
Can I...?

16:34.480 --> 16:36.620
It shouldn't be happening
so fast.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.780
It's fine.

16:39.880 --> 16:43.960
It's a miracle
and I feel fine.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.220
Gwen!

16:49.320 --> 16:52.380
-Let me take you to hospital.
-It's just morning sickness.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.700
We'll do a scan. We don't
have to tell them everything.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.860
I don't think
that's a good idea.

16:57.960 --> 17:02.700
Gwen.
This thing could be killing you.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.960
It's not a 'thing', Ray.

17:08.080 --> 17:10.080
Max understands.

17:52.320 --> 17:56.900
And these trousers.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.260
You made such a fuss

17:58.360 --> 18:01.020
about them being too showy
for the military ball.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.900
What a beautiful night that was.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.980
Ohh! We should
have gone dancing more.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.980
We were very good, you know.
Everyone said so.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.300
-Oh, stop this.
-Come on. Up.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.300
That's it.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.360
Oh, my Lorrie.

18:28.280 --> 18:30.280
I missed this.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.040
What is it?

18:39.320 --> 18:41.320
Sorry, I have to...

18:42.160 --> 18:44.480
-I have to go.
-What?

18:48.120 --> 18:52.140
He's one lucky kid.
No broken bones.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.280
His CT scan was clear.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.020
Hey, Isaac,

19:01.120 --> 19:04.780
I...I've just got a couple
of questions, if that's OK.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.880
Would that be alright?

19:11.280 --> 19:13.280
How did you get that car?

19:16.480 --> 19:19.000
Did your friend
give you the keys?

19:21.600 --> 19:25.060
Mate, I know you know
who I'm talking about, OK,

19:25.160 --> 19:27.340
'cause I saw him drag you out.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.220
He saved you.

19:29.320 --> 19:33.860
But you need to know that
he is not who he says he is, OK?

19:33.960 --> 19:36.080
His real name's Tommy Brydon.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.720
Do you understand me?

19:41.560 --> 19:46.160
Tommy is Sam. Sam is Tommy.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.980
-Tell me where he is!
-Griffo, that's enough.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.100
Come on.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.060
-I've been suspended over this.
-I don't care.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.620
Viv, I know, I know, I know.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.940
But you need to know

20:04.040 --> 20:06.820
that this guy that
he's hanging around with,

20:06.920 --> 20:09.500
he's a 68-year-old man
who killed a guy in Melbourne.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.740
That's ridiculous!
You showed us a photo of Sam.

20:11.840 --> 20:15.500
I did, but that's not him, OK?
That's...

20:15.600 --> 20:19.220
I mean, it is him but it's...

20:19.320 --> 20:23.380
You're just gonna have to
believe me when I say this, OK?

20:23.480 --> 20:26.900
Sam, the young guy
that I showed you,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.100
he's an old man.

20:29.200 --> 20:33.840
And he is cunning
and he is playing your son.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.020
I'll look after my boy,

20:41.120 --> 20:43.600
but you, Griffo,
you need to take a break.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.200
OK.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.440
Oh, you found them!

21:44.440 --> 21:47.300
Oh...Gwen.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.900
I need them.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.660
Loris, I...
I really need them.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.760
And you're...

21:56.960 --> 22:00.780
-They did that to you?
-Yeah.

22:00.880 --> 22:04.460
It's... It's a miracle!

22:04.560 --> 22:07.480
No. It's evil.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.620
You don't understand.

22:11.720 --> 22:14.700
-Get out of my way.
-Gwen, no! No!

22:14.800 --> 22:16.880
Oh, Gwen, stop it, please!

22:32.200 --> 22:34.680
Whooo!

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Oi!

23:06.040 --> 23:08.020
Hey, you!

23:08.120 --> 23:10.120
Hey!

23:13.560 --> 23:15.600
You have something of mine.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.740
No, mate, you've got
the wrong guy.

23:20.840 --> 23:23.440
What, you don't remember
stealing it?

23:26.640 --> 23:28.640
My jacket.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.720
You had one too, did ya?

23:36.800 --> 23:39.900
Where did you get it

23:40.000 --> 23:43.980
I don't know where your bloody
jacket is. Where did you get it?

23:44.080 --> 23:46.780
-I need it back.
-Where's the plant?

23:46.880 --> 23:48.880
No, that's not how
this game works.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.620
This is not a game.

23:52.720 --> 23:56.240
Ohh! I've missed this too!

23:58.280 --> 24:00.640
This is not a good day
to fuck with me.

24:26.600 --> 24:30.120
What the hell...

24:31.680 --> 24:33.340
Huh?

24:52.880 --> 24:55.980
-Are you going on a holiday?
-No.

24:56.080 --> 25:00.020
-I'm leaving. For good.
-What are you talking about?

25:00.120 --> 25:02.660
Well, there's no trust
and when that's gone

25:02.760 --> 25:04.760
there's nothing.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.100
OK. OK. Are you talking about
Kristy Morgan?

25:11.320 --> 25:14.220
Because if you are, that was
a one-night stand five years ago

25:14.320 --> 25:17.140
and it was a mistake -
I've regretted it ever since.

25:17.240 --> 25:20.300
And my sister

25:20.400 --> 25:22.480
Your sister

25:25.720 --> 25:28.700
Don't act dumb, Griffo.
It suits you too much.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.860
What are you talking...?

25:30.960 --> 25:32.660
Are you serious?

25:32.760 --> 25:35.380
Is that what you've been
stewing on?

25:35.480 --> 25:37.740
God, Tina,
why didn't you just ask me?

25:37.840 --> 25:40.820
I was working, the morning
of the flood, with Rhonda.

25:40.920 --> 25:43.420
I was nowhere near Karen,
or the bloody caravan.

25:43.520 --> 25:46.880
No, that is bullshit! I saw the
way she used to flirt with you.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.080
She didn't...
Oh, my g...

25:52.320 --> 25:54.840
OK, OK, look.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.500
Please.

25:57.600 --> 26:00.300
I know I haven't been
a good husband, right?

26:00.400 --> 26:02.740
I haven't given you the love
or attention you deserve.

26:02.840 --> 26:05.260
I swear I...
Oh, fuck.

26:05.360 --> 26:08.020
But I-I never, ever had sex,

26:08.120 --> 26:11.380
not even remotely wanted
to have sex with your sister.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.420
But she was so beautiful.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.520
Not to me. You were the one that
always lit up my room - you.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.280
Please don't go.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.580
Please.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.820
We just need to talk to
each other,

26:26.920 --> 26:29.720
we just need to be honest
with each other.

26:33.760 --> 26:37.020
Then...there's something
you should know...

26:37.120 --> 26:40.440
..in the spirit of being honest.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.500
I've been unfaithful too.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.540
What?

26:45.640 --> 26:49.040
It didn't mean anything
and it's over.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.140
-Griffo.
-Oh, God.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.900
-Griffo.
-I can't believe it.

26:54.000 --> 26:54.820
Griff.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.740
I can't believe
this is happening.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.080
Look, I...

27:22.560 --> 27:23.980
What took you so long?

27:24.080 --> 27:27.140
They weren't where I thought
they were. We're alright.

27:27.240 --> 27:29.940
-I was so worried.
-There's no need to be.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.040
Here.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.760
Here.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.820
Max. Max!

28:03.920 --> 28:06.340
Look. Look!

28:09.280 --> 28:12.400
It's the little one,
can't wait to join us.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.580
Maybe... Maybe we should
go to a doctor.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.940
What?

28:21.040 --> 28:25.400
I'm just... I'm just
thinking of the baby.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.520
Ray thinks that we should go.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.920
You went to see Ray?

28:34.880 --> 28:37.580
No.

28:37.680 --> 28:40.400
-But maybe...
-You don't listen to Ray.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.400
Ray doesn't want this for us.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.780
Hey.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.880
Relax, alright?

28:53.760 --> 28:55.760
I'm gonna cook us some dinner.

28:57.520 --> 29:00.980
And then maybe tomorrow
we could go to the doctor?

29:01.080 --> 29:02.980
No. No!

29:03.080 --> 29:05.080
No!

29:08.160 --> 29:10.240
I'm all you need.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.180
Hey.

29:28.280 --> 29:31.460
I want to report an incident.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.700
Did your mum lock you
out of the house again?

29:33.800 --> 29:39.120
No. I was attacked by a woman,
sexually.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.780
-A woman.
-Yeah.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.940
This young Indian girl.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.620
I've got the scars to prove it.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.540
I don't have the time for this,
Shane.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.380
-Do you know Farida Korrapati?
-Mm.

29:51.480 --> 29:54.380
Well, this girl claimed
to be her granddaughter.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.740
I've never seen her before
in my entire life

29:56.840 --> 29:59.980
but she was convinced
that we knew each other.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.580
At first I thought that Farida
must have told her about me

30:02.680 --> 30:05.100
but why would she?

30:05.200 --> 30:09.780
Unless there's some... they have
some kind of connection.

30:09.880 --> 30:11.380
I'll look into it.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.160
-Really?
-Yeah.

30:35.840 --> 30:38.140
I need to speak to somebody
about my grandmother.

30:38.240 --> 30:41.120
-She was reported missing.
-And your name is?

30:42.160 --> 30:45.020
Alicia. Farida's granddaughter.

30:45.120 --> 30:48.620
And you can call off your
investigation. She's fine.

30:48.720 --> 30:51.580
Oh, you have information
about Farida's whereabouts?

30:51.680 --> 30:55.140
She's gone to live with friends
in Sydney.

30:55.240 --> 30:58.420
It was very sudden so she didn't
have time to let anyone know

30:58.520 --> 31:00.460
but she's healthy and happy.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.380
Oh, well, that's good news.

31:02.480 --> 31:05.460
I'll still need you to make
an official statement.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.800
Just have a seat, Alicia.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.940
Hey, hold up. Where do you think
you're going?

31:13.040 --> 31:14.220
Ah, the property cabinet.

31:14.320 --> 31:17.540
No, mate, you're suspended,
remember?

31:17.640 --> 31:21.600
My camcorder's in there.
It's my personal property.

31:26.040 --> 31:27.820
You wouldn't happen
to know anything

31:27.920 --> 31:29.940
about an attack on
Shane Rawlins, would you?

31:30.040 --> 31:33.280
Just hurry up,
before I change my mind.

31:40.560 --> 31:43.540
Now don't come back
until I tell you.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.940
I'll be coming back
on my own terms, thanks, Sarge.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.580
Want to know why?

31:47.680 --> 31:50.780
I've found the shapeshifter
and I'm gonna prove to everyone

31:50.880 --> 31:54.220
that Sam and Tommy Brydon
are exactly the same person,

31:54.320 --> 31:56.700
despite there being 50 years
between the two of them.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.700
Mate, before I was worried
about your job,

31:59.800 --> 32:02.940
but now I am genuinely concerned
about you.

32:03.040 --> 32:07.480
As a friend, I think you need
serious help.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.520
Farida.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.420
OK.

33:05.520 --> 33:09.340
Not my best angle and not great
lighting either, but here goes.

33:09.440 --> 33:12.540
I, um, I'm a coward, Ray,

33:12.640 --> 33:15.140
because I should be saying this
to you in person

33:15.240 --> 33:16.940
but every time I try to

33:17.040 --> 33:23.060
all I can see is your eyes
willing me, imploring me,

33:23.160 --> 33:26.900
not to give up, to fight.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.700
But soon I won't be able to
feed myself, to talk...

33:32.800 --> 33:36.000
..or to recognise
your beautiful face.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.480
And you'll still be there.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.460
Oh, Ray, my darling Ray,

33:43.560 --> 33:46.360
I know you don't want to
hear this but...

33:48.360 --> 33:53.780
..when I get to the point where
I no longer know who I am...

34:44.200 --> 34:46.200
What were you doing?

34:47.080 --> 34:49.080
There they are.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.560
My two favourite people.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.880
You remember these?

35:00.880 --> 35:02.880
Sorry flowers?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.880
I shouldn't have spoken to you
like that.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Forgive me?

35:26.840 --> 35:31.040
They're beautiful.
Thank you.

36:45.440 --> 36:48.840
-Where have you been?
-Walking.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.680
You stay in there!

37:02.560 --> 37:04.380
Hi, Loris.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.740
Don't know how this ended up
in Isaac's things

37:06.840 --> 37:08.700
but obviously it's Herb's.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.140
Oh, yeah.

37:11.240 --> 37:14.860
-You OK?
-Oh, never better.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.460
Um, thanks for the jacket.

37:17.560 --> 37:20.280
Herb will be
very appreciative.

37:21.920 --> 37:25.840
Well, thanks again. Bye.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.260
You found it.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.260
You found it!

37:37.360 --> 37:39.840
How did it end up with Isaac?

37:45.400 --> 37:47.020
I'm going to return it.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.760
What are you talking about?
It's yours.

37:51.360 --> 37:52.740
It's Frank's.

37:52.840 --> 37:56.340
Frank Warlie and I
swapped jackets in Vietnam.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.380
He'll be thrilled
to get this back.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.480
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.820
I need to see him, Loris.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.200
What has this done to you?

38:22.400 --> 38:26.220
The
national anthem of Peru.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.400
-You alright, mate?

40:58.800 --> 41:00.800
Oh, my God.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.940
Hi, you've called Ray and Gwen.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.300
We can't take your call right
now so please leave a message.

41:20.400 --> 41:23.920
Ray, it's Gwen.

41:25.360 --> 41:28.500
Something...
Something's not right.

41:28.600 --> 41:33.200
I don't feel safe here.
I think I need your help.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.840
Please?

41:37.440 --> 41:39.720
Gwen

42:23.040 --> 42:26.460
Hey. Where are you going?

42:26.560 --> 42:28.800
I... It's just...

42:30.120 --> 42:31.580
..cramps.

42:31.680 --> 42:36.780
I was...just going to get
something for them.

42:36.880 --> 42:40.460
Gwennie, I'll get whatever you
need, you know that. Just ask.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.260
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

42:42.360 --> 42:43.820
Shh. Don't worry.

42:43.920 --> 42:46.220
-Ohhh.
-I'll keep you safe.

42:46.320 --> 42:49.120
Shh. You're OK.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.720
I've got a plan.

43:13.600 --> 43:15.600
Gwen?

43:17.480 --> 43:19.480
Gwen?

43:23.120 --> 43:25.120
Gwen?

44:10.640 --> 44:14.920
Welcome back, dickhead.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.380
Now, tell me, mate...

44:19.480 --> 44:21.700
..how the fuck did you do this?

44:30.080 --> 44:31.940
OK.

44:32.040 --> 44:34.300
Well, we've got all the time
in the world, mate.

44:34.400 --> 44:38.080
You're not going anywhere
and neither am I, so...

44:44.360 --> 44:47.040
She finally give you the boot,
did she?

44:49.120 --> 44:53.080
Oh, yeah.
Now the penny's dropping, huh?

44:57.360 --> 44:59.640
Oh, she's a wild one, that one.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.640
Holy shit!

45:20.400 --> 45:22.860
Christ is the light
of the world.

45:22.960 --> 45:26.300
He is my saviour, my light,
my hope, my salvation.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.020
Christ is the light
of the world.

45:28.120 --> 45:31.440
He is my saviour, my light,
my hope, my salvation.

46:50.800 --> 46:53.700
It's a travesty, isn't it?

46:53.800 --> 46:56.020
What's that, mate?

46:56.120 --> 46:58.580
The only cop that knows anything
about this

46:58.680 --> 47:04.660
is the dumbest piece of shit
ever to put on a uniform.

47:04.760 --> 47:07.860
Yeah, except I just filmed
this whole freak show, didn't I?

47:07.960 --> 47:09.960
This is my lottery ticket, mate.
