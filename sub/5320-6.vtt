00:07.674 --> 00:09.490
Where do you think
they go to the bathroom?

00:09.605 --> 00:11.522
I don't know.
I mean, they're out there all day.

00:11.607 --> 00:12.907
And you see what they eat.

00:12.992 --> 00:15.526
And no one lets
'em in the house.

00:16.311 --> 00:18.144
It's curious.

00:18.230 --> 00:19.813
Most curious.

00:19.898 --> 00:21.398
Not that curious.

00:21.483 --> 00:23.033
I mean, who cares?

00:23.068 --> 00:24.568
I care. I care about

00:24.620 --> 00:26.703
where people go to the bathroom,
especially cabbies.

00:26.738 --> 00:28.822
They're driving around in
their cab all day long.

00:28.907 --> 00:30.290
Do they have a certain spot?

00:30.375 --> 00:32.409
Do they have to talk to a guy?
Do they have to buy something?

00:32.494 --> 00:34.211
If it's a production,
do they have to buy more stuff?

00:34.246 --> 00:35.629
What if they have a fare?

00:35.714 --> 00:37.297
It's a quandary.

00:37.382 --> 00:39.082
I think you spend too much time

00:39.134 --> 00:40.634
thinking about
where people shit.

00:40.719 --> 00:42.586
I don't think you spend enough.

00:43.922 --> 00:45.922
Curious.

00:45.974 --> 00:47.424
<i>Most</i> curious.

00:53.649 --> 00:55.265
<i>Big news, guys. I'm going</i>

00:55.317 --> 00:56.766
to train for a race.

00:56.852 --> 00:57.767
The marathon.
The what?

00:57.819 --> 00:58.935
The marathon.

00:59.021 --> 01:00.320
Wait. The what?
The marathon.

01:00.405 --> 01:01.571
You're training for the...
Kevin!

01:01.607 --> 01:03.490
Oh, shit!

01:03.575 --> 01:05.859
- Not the marathon. I'm running the beer mile.
- The what?

01:05.944 --> 01:07.694
The beer mile.
The what? I...

01:07.779 --> 01:09.446
Kevin, please stop.
No, I don't want to do it again.

01:09.498 --> 01:10.614
I just don't know what it is.
Oh.

01:10.699 --> 01:11.998
The beer mile is a mile race,

01:12.084 --> 01:13.416
and every quarter of a mile,

01:13.452 --> 01:14.784
you have to stop
and chug a beer.

01:14.870 --> 01:16.119
Real runner's high.
Yeah.

01:16.171 --> 01:18.038
And my training starts today.

01:18.123 --> 01:19.172
Hi, guys!

01:19.258 --> 01:20.123
Bam!

01:20.208 --> 01:21.291
Bam!

01:21.343 --> 01:23.460
Uh, zoom!
Ooh!

01:23.545 --> 01:24.511
Oh.
Wow!

01:24.596 --> 01:25.762
What is...?
Showy show?

01:25.797 --> 01:27.297
Wow.
What are we doing here?

01:27.349 --> 01:29.215
What are you wearing, Andre?
Oh.

01:29.301 --> 01:31.801
These are sports kilts. All
the cool kids are wearing them.

01:31.853 --> 01:34.104
- Yes, all the cool kids and you, Andre.
- Ooh, Jenny,

01:34.139 --> 01:35.805
I like what you're doing.
You're trying to get in my head,

01:35.857 --> 01:37.390
'cause we have a big game
coming up, but you can't.

01:37.476 --> 01:38.942
Yeah, you're going down

01:38.977 --> 01:40.477
like there's a shot of Jager
on Kevin's crank.

01:40.562 --> 01:42.312
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Meegan's better

01:42.397 --> 01:43.897
at shit-talking than you are, Andre.
I don't mind it.

01:43.982 --> 01:46.650
It's great, 'cause
when you face me from now on,

01:46.702 --> 01:48.652
you have to face us...
not one head...

01:48.737 --> 01:49.786
But two heads.

01:49.821 --> 01:51.121
Great. Bring it.

01:51.156 --> 01:52.822
- We're looking at you.
- Oh, we see it.

01:52.874 --> 01:54.240
Eeh, eeh...
I see somebody...

01:54.326 --> 01:56.710
...who is a...
...who sucks balls.

01:56.795 --> 01:58.662
I don't know what to do with that.
I don't, either.

01:58.714 --> 02:00.997
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

02:01.083 --> 02:03.416
Yeah.
Just be, guys... Be right back.

02:03.502 --> 02:05.635
So you're fine with her
wearing the pants in the family?

02:05.671 --> 02:07.921
- I think it's amazing that <i> no one</i>
wears pants in that family. - True.

02:08.006 --> 02:09.339
From the beer mile
to the highlander,

02:09.390 --> 02:10.806
Meegan really knows
how to pick 'em.

02:10.842 --> 02:14.344
I just wanted to talk to you
away from, um, all the guys.

02:14.429 --> 02:16.646
Yeah, sure.
Um... so, uh...

02:16.682 --> 02:18.682
I just wanted to...

02:18.767 --> 02:21.067
talk...

02:21.153 --> 02:23.019
Um...

02:23.105 --> 02:24.688
Trade.

02:24.740 --> 02:26.406
Trade?
You have running backs.

02:26.491 --> 02:28.441
We have wide receivers.

02:28.527 --> 02:29.859
Let's dance.

02:29.945 --> 02:31.945
I'm sorry. This is just...

02:32.030 --> 02:33.530
What?
I'm having a hard time

02:33.582 --> 02:35.749
processing the fact that...
What?

02:35.834 --> 02:37.701
...we're talking
about fantasy football,

02:37.786 --> 02:40.670
and it's not you yelling
at me for not wanting to do...

02:40.706 --> 02:42.088
I mean, it's just strange.

02:42.174 --> 02:43.757
Bad strange, or good strange?
Good strange.

02:43.842 --> 02:46.710
I just, uh...
I mean, it's-it's odd with...

02:46.795 --> 02:48.345
with him watching.

02:50.098 --> 02:52.382
Oh, hi. Don't mind me.
I like to watch.

02:52.467 --> 02:54.100
He <i> loves</i> to watch.

02:54.186 --> 02:55.802
I don't love being watched.
Can we get back to business?

02:55.887 --> 02:57.554
Ooh, yeah, let's talk trade.

02:57.639 --> 02:59.556
What do you got?
Oh, Jesus! Close your legs, Andre.

02:59.608 --> 03:00.529
Oh, fine.
I'm-I'm sorry.

03:00.559 --> 03:01.858
This is...

03:01.893 --> 03:03.727
Oh, I mean...
No. No.

03:04.896 --> 03:07.147
He's just not ready.

03:15.574 --> 03:17.741
Hey, Pete.
Taco. What are you doing?

03:17.793 --> 03:19.826
Ow!
Chase me!

03:19.911 --> 03:21.461
Asshole!

03:21.546 --> 03:23.663
Whoa!

03:23.749 --> 03:25.915
Shit! Oh!

03:25.967 --> 03:27.217
Whoa!

03:27.252 --> 03:28.218
Come on, you pussy!
Hey!

03:28.253 --> 03:29.335
Jesus.

03:29.421 --> 03:31.221
Come on, Pete!
Jesus! Jesus! Aah!

03:31.256 --> 03:32.422
Jesus Christ!

03:32.507 --> 03:34.424
Let's go, Pete!
Aah!

03:36.928 --> 03:39.145
I admire your guts.

03:39.231 --> 03:40.980
Let me train you
for the beer mile.

03:41.066 --> 03:42.682
Why would I let you do that?
You almost killed me.

03:42.768 --> 03:44.818
'Cause I was beer mile
regional champion 2008.

03:44.903 --> 03:46.269
I never heard about this.

03:46.321 --> 03:48.021
It's difficult for me
to talk about, Pete.

03:48.106 --> 03:49.656
I won that thing
fair and square,

03:49.741 --> 03:51.608
but then I was disqualified.
What happened?

03:51.660 --> 03:53.777
Take a look.

03:53.862 --> 03:55.445
I'm the best

03:55.530 --> 03:56.946
drunk runner in the world!

04:00.952 --> 04:03.703
Time for a mental warm-down.

04:05.874 --> 04:07.874
What? What are you doing?!

04:07.959 --> 04:09.592
It's just drugs!
Get off of me.

04:09.628 --> 04:12.095
<i>Apparently, you're not allowed</i>
<i>to take mind-enhancing drugs</i>

04:12.130 --> 04:14.097
before, during or
immediately after the race.

04:14.132 --> 04:15.632
Sticklers!

04:15.717 --> 04:19.135
But I know how to run
it, Pete, and goddamn it,

04:19.187 --> 04:20.553
I know how to win it.

04:20.639 --> 04:23.556
All right, Taco.
All right, I'm in.

04:23.642 --> 04:25.191
Training starts now.

04:25.277 --> 04:26.309
Back into traffic.
Taco! Jesus!

04:28.196 --> 04:29.979
<i>So, how are you feeling
about the games this weekend?</i>

04:30.065 --> 04:31.147
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

04:31.199 --> 04:32.315
I feel great.
Really?

04:32.367 --> 04:33.566
Oh, yeah.
Are you sure?

04:33.652 --> 04:35.652
Oh, yeah, the Lady MacArthurs
are feeling fine!

04:35.737 --> 04:38.955
I just feel like
the flex is where

04:38.990 --> 04:42.292
the double entendres
are going to shine.

04:42.327 --> 04:43.910
Oh, yeah.
I just love the matchup

04:43.995 --> 04:45.915
Mike Evans has against the Panthers.
Interesting.

04:45.964 --> 04:48.047
'Cause, you know,
Andre has Brandin Cooks

04:48.133 --> 04:49.716
in his lineup this week.

04:49.801 --> 04:51.602
No, he's not.
He's playing my guy.

04:51.670 --> 04:53.636
He said something
about how he was really excited

04:53.672 --> 04:55.722
about all the targets
Cooks was gonna have.

04:55.807 --> 04:57.173
This isn't a PPR.
I know.

04:57.225 --> 04:59.265
And Brees's shoulder is questionable.
I know, right?

04:59.344 --> 05:01.094
Hey, girlfriend, #RealTalk.

05:01.179 --> 05:03.229
Do you know Andre says that all the time?
I know.

05:03.315 --> 05:04.731
That's where I got it.
Isn't it so cute?

05:04.816 --> 05:07.484
Mm.
Okay, sister... spill.

05:07.519 --> 05:09.652
You used to run Kevin's team.

05:09.688 --> 05:12.489
What?! No.
Yes.

05:12.524 --> 05:16.075
Yes. Yes.
So, how did you do that?

05:16.161 --> 05:18.194
The secret is
you have to <i> be</i> in charge

05:18.280 --> 05:20.830
without ever appearing
to be in charge.

05:20.866 --> 05:24.200
Oh, like when I convince
Andre to role-play

05:24.286 --> 05:25.752
in the bedroom.

05:25.837 --> 05:27.787
You would think that
Andre would love it.

05:27.873 --> 05:29.873
You would think that.
'Cause he loves costumes, right?

05:29.958 --> 05:31.374
Yeah.
But not in the bedroom.

05:31.459 --> 05:33.593
I had to really break
him out of his shell.

05:33.678 --> 05:35.178
And now I have a
little minx in there.

05:35.213 --> 05:37.680
You know what
the most important thing is?

05:37.716 --> 05:39.349
Okay, what?
At the end of the day,

05:39.384 --> 05:40.884
you get final cut.

05:40.936 --> 05:42.635
Final cut.
Trust me.

05:42.721 --> 05:44.187
Listen, thank you.

05:44.222 --> 05:46.222
That was really nice of you
to share that with me.

05:46.308 --> 05:48.057
You're welcome. I have to go.
Okay, bye.

05:48.143 --> 05:50.443
Bye. Oh!
Mwaw!<i> Mwaw!</i>

05:50.529 --> 05:52.445
You're so cute, I want
to wear your skin!

05:54.733 --> 05:58.067
#LosingSucks. Bye!

05:58.153 --> 06:00.036
Hey, thank you!

06:04.095 --> 06:06.642
Oh, come on, Chalupa!

06:06.762 --> 06:08.595
Pick up your stuff.

06:10.315 --> 06:12.265
Oh, God!

06:12.317 --> 06:13.767
Oh!

06:13.819 --> 06:16.436
Oh, come on!

06:16.521 --> 06:18.354
Yuck! Ew!

06:21.230 --> 06:24.420
Curious. Most curious.

06:25.008 --> 06:26.641
<i>Could have been an animal,</i>

06:26.676 --> 06:28.925
but I really think
it might have been the gardener.

06:29.045 --> 06:31.031
Maybe it fell out
of your hot tub.

06:31.255 --> 06:33.578
No. No, it did not fall
out of my hot tub, Ruxin.

06:33.707 --> 06:35.073
It was definitely human.

06:35.158 --> 06:36.658
How could you tell it was human?

06:36.743 --> 06:38.209
Less talk, more drink.
All right.

06:38.245 --> 06:39.494
Please. I know my
own kind, all right?

06:39.579 --> 06:40.912
It was definitely human.

06:40.997 --> 06:43.465
So you've got, like,
gaydar, but for poop?

06:43.550 --> 06:44.582
Yeah, it's like poo-dar.

06:44.668 --> 06:46.084
It's like a sixth sense.

06:46.169 --> 06:47.419
Or like ESP and poo.

06:47.504 --> 06:49.220
And... stop.

06:49.256 --> 06:50.922
Mmm.
All right, interval training done.

06:51.007 --> 06:52.807
Take a breather. I'm gonna get more beer.
Oh, okay.

06:52.893 --> 06:55.643
All right, Mr. Ref, do me a
favor and settle it for me.

06:55.729 --> 06:57.846
Tell me if it's
human poop or not.

06:57.931 --> 07:00.565
- You want me to come to
your house and inspect a turd? - No.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.400
I got it in my car. Just look at it.
No!

07:02.436 --> 07:03.902
I will not.

07:03.937 --> 07:05.377
Peruse it and tell me
what you think.

07:05.405 --> 07:07.021
Look, people are disgusting.

07:07.107 --> 07:09.157
They take shits in weird places,

07:09.242 --> 07:11.993
like the side of the road
or the Pacific Ocean.

07:12.078 --> 07:13.528
Exactly. Those who live

07:13.613 --> 07:14.863
in glass houses should not

07:14.948 --> 07:17.415
squeeze out stones, Seabiscuit.
I love this.

07:17.451 --> 07:19.033
Everyone is out speeding,
and I'm the only one

07:19.119 --> 07:20.440
that gets a ticket.
I mean, people

07:20.454 --> 07:22.420
go in weird places.
That's that.

07:22.456 --> 07:23.755
I'll admit it,
I pee in the shower.

07:23.790 --> 07:25.391
Yeah, I mean, you got to go,
you just go.

07:25.425 --> 07:27.959
Yeah, I go in the shower.
The only bad part is

07:28.044 --> 07:29.594
mashing it
down the drain afterwards.

07:29.629 --> 07:30.628
What?
Wait, you

07:30.714 --> 07:32.464
shit in the shower?
Dude,

07:32.516 --> 07:33.798
we were talking about peeing.

07:35.802 --> 07:37.268
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

07:37.304 --> 07:38.584
Taco, do you shit in the shower?

07:40.140 --> 07:41.340
I'm saving water...
no flushing.

07:41.391 --> 07:42.807
Oh, my God.
Ugh.

07:42.893 --> 07:44.809
What do you do... you just
mash it down with your foot?

07:44.861 --> 07:48.780
No, I'm not an animal.
I have a shower spatula.

07:48.815 --> 07:51.449
Jesus Christ. My gardener shits
in my bushes and my brother

07:51.485 --> 07:53.868
shits in his shower. I mean,
this is the end of days.

07:53.954 --> 07:55.787
No, not my shower.
Your shower.

07:55.822 --> 07:57.155
What?
Oh,

07:57.207 --> 07:58.490
you know what?
It's fine,

07:58.542 --> 08:00.408
it just means that
he uses your spatula.

08:00.494 --> 08:03.127
Taco, we made pancakes this morning.
Oh, don't be

08:03.163 --> 08:05.380
such a baby. I rinse it off
briefly afterwards.

08:05.465 --> 08:07.215
Yeah. What?
Enough warm-up.

08:07.300 --> 08:09.384
Go get changed, we're gonna
do a 5K, six-pack run.

08:09.469 --> 08:10.668
Let's go!
Let's go!

08:14.224 --> 08:16.007
Uh, pancakes for breakfast?

08:17.344 --> 08:19.227
Chocolate chip?

08:22.649 --> 08:24.182
So how you feeling?

08:24.234 --> 08:25.600
Pretty good.
You shouldn't be!

08:25.685 --> 08:27.268
You should be wasted right now.

08:27.354 --> 08:30.355
You have the blood alcohol level
of a pregnant woman. Come on!

08:30.407 --> 08:32.991
Four. Yeah, that's
right, feel the burn.

08:34.744 --> 08:36.660
All right, good. We got
to strengthen that gut.

08:36.696 --> 08:38.363
Let's do it again.

08:38.414 --> 08:39.697
Come on, you been
nursing the same beer

08:39.783 --> 08:41.416
for the last half mile.

08:41.501 --> 08:43.102
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Okay, okay.

08:43.169 --> 08:45.370
See, i-it's quaffable.
Stop saying "quaffable."

08:45.455 --> 08:46.671
Let's go, let's go,
let's go. Hurry up.

08:46.706 --> 08:48.873
Chug, two, three, four.
Chug, two, three, four.

08:48.959 --> 08:52.010
Personal best.
Keep it going, keep it going!

08:52.045 --> 08:53.545
No, you see, just smell it.

08:53.597 --> 08:55.380
Here we go.
Come on, pump those knees.

08:55.432 --> 08:58.516
We got seven more cases
to get through.

08:58.552 --> 09:00.518
I think you're right, Big B.
I-I'm letting this anger

09:00.554 --> 09:03.438
eat me up inside, and I got
to just be happy for him.

09:03.523 --> 09:05.523
To Meegan and Andre...
let 'em be happy.

09:05.559 --> 09:07.358
Yeah, to Meevan and Andre.

09:07.394 --> 09:10.562
Mm. Um, what's this
have to do with the training?

09:10.614 --> 09:13.314
Oh, right, the training.
Let's get back to it.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.199
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
O... Okay.

09:15.235 --> 09:17.569
35.

09:17.621 --> 09:20.071
The next one.

09:20.156 --> 09:22.206
Yeah, that's a big boy.
Double-team that shit.

09:22.242 --> 09:25.543
Right, down.
Left, down.

09:25.579 --> 09:27.462
Drink.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.799
All right, now everyone
switch beers.

09:31.885 --> 09:33.134
<i>All right, Pete,</i>

09:33.219 --> 09:34.752
you're almost there.
Let's do this!

09:36.000 --> 09:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:45.732 --> 09:48.182
Personal best.

09:48.268 --> 09:50.101
All right, you deserve a beer.

09:50.153 --> 09:52.233
No, no, no, no, no, suck it
back in, suck it back in.

09:52.272 --> 09:53.432
You're gonna get disqualified.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.324
Oh, come on.

09:56.409 --> 09:58.326
I feel better.

09:58.411 --> 09:59.410
Back to the beginning.
Let's go.

09:59.446 --> 10:00.995
No!

10:01.081 --> 10:02.997
<i>Lover,</i>

10:03.083 --> 10:04.283
do you like the collared shirt

10:04.334 --> 10:07.001
with the crushed velvet vest

10:07.087 --> 10:09.837
or the Nehru collar
with the scarf?

10:09.923 --> 10:11.289
Why are you asking me?

10:11.341 --> 10:13.124
Because I value
your opinion, my love.

10:13.209 --> 10:14.592
Do you?
Yes.

10:14.628 --> 10:18.212
Because I noticed that
you're not playing my lineup.

10:18.298 --> 10:20.348
Okay, is this about the flex?

10:20.433 --> 10:22.967
'Cause it's not a big deal. Come on.
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

10:23.019 --> 10:24.686
Why won't you play Mike Evans?
I believe

10:24.771 --> 10:27.472
that Brandin Cooks is gonna
score more points, that's all.

10:27.557 --> 10:29.641
It's not a big deal.
Oh. Well, I believe

10:29.693 --> 10:32.360
Brandin Cooks
is the Nehru collar

10:32.445 --> 10:33.978
and pleather pants of our team.

10:34.064 --> 10:35.563
Wait.
Is that good or bad?

10:35.649 --> 10:36.814
That's my point.

10:36.866 --> 10:38.983
You trust me with everything.

10:39.069 --> 10:41.486
Why won't you trust
me with our team?

10:41.571 --> 10:44.155
I want to share final cut.

10:44.207 --> 10:45.373
I can't share final cut.

10:45.458 --> 10:46.579
Well, then I <i> want</i> final cut.

10:46.660 --> 10:48.180
No, you can't have final cut.
That's...

10:48.244 --> 10:49.711
I want final cut.
You're not gonna get it.

10:49.796 --> 10:51.963
I'm sorry, but no.
It's my-it's my choice.

10:51.998 --> 10:53.164
Oh, okay.
And that's final.

10:53.249 --> 10:54.215
Well, then, you can
just... you know what?

10:54.300 --> 10:55.967
Wear whatever you want.

10:56.002 --> 10:57.418
That's final, there you go.
It's gonna be awesome.

10:57.504 --> 10:58.670
That's... great.

10:58.755 --> 10:59.837
You should do that.
Well, great, thank you.

10:59.889 --> 11:01.305
Thank you very much.

11:01.341 --> 11:02.462
You're gonna look fantastic.

11:05.762 --> 11:07.595
What are we doing?

11:07.681 --> 11:10.231
Honey.
I love you.

11:10.316 --> 11:12.266
Okay?
And I love us.

11:12.352 --> 11:13.518
So come here.

11:13.603 --> 11:15.153
Come here.

11:15.188 --> 11:17.689
Come here,
come here, come here. Look.

11:17.741 --> 11:19.490
Let's make a promise.

11:19.526 --> 11:22.910
Fantasy football
can never come between us.

11:22.996 --> 11:24.328
Okay?
Promise?

11:24.364 --> 11:25.780
Mm.
Mm.

11:25.865 --> 11:27.582
Mmm!

11:39.082 --> 11:41.833
Hmm.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.952
Curious, curious.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.453
Hey, Ernesto.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.088
<i>Sí, Se?or-Se?or Kevin.</i>

11:47.124 --> 11:48.373
How are you?

11:48.458 --> 11:49.424
<i>Uh, muy bien.</i>
<i>Hola.</i>

11:49.459 --> 11:50.925
Quick question for you.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.681
Have you noticed any
animals around here?

11:52.801 --> 11:54.512
Family of chipmunks.
No.

11:54.598 --> 11:56.297
No, that's...
that wouldn't do it.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.549
<i>No, se?or.</i>
No.

11:57.634 --> 11:58.967
Man, you guys love
those burritos, huh?

11:59.019 --> 12:00.301
<i>Oh, sí.</i>

12:00.353 --> 12:02.137
Ah, the carne asada.
<i>Riquisimo.</i>

12:02.189 --> 12:04.055
I don't even know where
you guys put it all.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.524
Everybody's got to go
sometime, though, you know?

12:06.610 --> 12:08.309
Oh, yes, very much.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.727
Yeah. It's
strange, because

12:09.813 --> 12:12.564
it's not like, you know...
you can use the house.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.450
I can use the house?
What?

12:15.485 --> 12:18.486
<i> Gracias, Se?or Kevin.</i>
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

12:23.960 --> 12:26.127
<i>Muchas gracias, Se?or Kevin.</i>

12:26.163 --> 12:28.496
<i>De nada.</i>

12:28.548 --> 12:29.998
<i>No bueno.</i>

12:30.083 --> 12:32.167
Now we know the answer
to the ago-old question:

12:32.219 --> 12:34.420
where does the gardener shit?
He shits in Kevin's house.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.554
Okay, Edward 40-Hands.
Nuts?

12:36.640 --> 12:38.673
No, thank you.
I'm not gonna make it.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.566
It's the first day of training.
You'll be fine.

12:40.644 --> 12:42.977
Then the guy stopped by
at 9:00 at night.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.847
9:00 to take a crap? I mean,
I think he was on a date, too.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.183
Mm. Less talk,
more drink, boys.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.268
Come on, the race is this weekend.
Oh, yeah, by the way, the race

12:50.353 --> 12:51.853
goes right by your house,
Kevin, so Jenny'll

12:51.905 --> 12:53.188
come up for some moral support.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.913
All right, we got
orange slices in a mile.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.774
Yes!
Thank God. Inside a Hefeweizen.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.526
Oh.
Oh, my God.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.745
Short cut, short cut.
All right.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.833
Watching college football
just doesn't do it for me anymore.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.751
It's like you're jerking
off to a porn magazine.

13:06.837 --> 13:08.753
It feels like
it should work, but...

13:08.839 --> 13:10.171
Just doesn't get the job done.

13:10.207 --> 13:11.789
Exactly.
Yeah.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.075
I feel the same way.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.959
Knock, knock.
Oh.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.678
Hey, Ernesto. I didn't know
you were doing the lawn today.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.513
Oh, no, no, today is Saturday.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.381
I do your neighbors...
the Pinkertons?

13:20.433 --> 13:21.549
Oh.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.186
Uh, Ernesto,

13:25.222 --> 13:27.722
really bad news.
Our bathroom...

13:27.807 --> 13:29.440
is broken.

13:29.526 --> 13:30.859
Ooh.

13:30.894 --> 13:34.112
That's okay,
I use the upstairs again, okay?

13:34.197 --> 13:35.563
Oh.<i> Hola.</i>

13:35.615 --> 13:37.031
<i>Hola.</i>

13:37.067 --> 13:38.566
Good magazine.
Oh...

13:38.618 --> 13:40.034
Again?

13:40.070 --> 13:41.736
What?
Kevin, you must not

13:41.821 --> 13:44.072
give me the name of your gardener.
You got to go

13:44.124 --> 13:46.124
talk to him.
What am I gonna say to him?

13:46.209 --> 13:47.458
Hello!
Hello!

13:47.544 --> 13:50.295
Well, if it's not
our favorite couple.

13:50.380 --> 13:51.663
Well. Hey, listen...

13:51.748 --> 13:53.248
you can't break us.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.084
Ever. We are strong.
Just like team.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.253
Great. Come on in, guys. Have a seat.
Yeah. Good. Yeah, get comfy.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.639
It's a little messy. I'm so sorry.
Yeah. Here. Come on in. Can I,

14:01.725 --> 14:04.142
uh, offer you guys something to drink?
We don't have any wine open,

14:04.227 --> 14:06.827
- I don't think, but we can open
one of the bottles you guys - No.

14:06.897 --> 14:09.397
brought over.
Um, whatever you want. Pick.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.099
So I can pick the wine!

14:11.184 --> 14:13.234
Okay. I can't pick
the flex,

14:13.270 --> 14:14.986
but I can pick the wine.
I wasn't saying that,

14:15.071 --> 14:17.188
I wasn't saying that, I wasn't saying that.
Yeah.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.023
Who are you gonna play in your flex?
Uh,

14:19.109 --> 14:21.943
well, we're talking about it.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.362
Right? Aren't we talking about it? Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.864
I'm gonna have a beer.
We'll... Thank you for asking.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.511
Right that way?
Right around the corner.

14:28.585 --> 14:30.451
Same place it was when you were with Pete.
Oh,

14:30.503 --> 14:32.587
Ruxin, you're a dreamboat!

14:32.622 --> 14:35.123
Ugh. How-how did you guys
run a team

14:35.208 --> 14:36.958
- together?
- Oh, it's simple.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.677
Yeah. I charmed, begged,
and then I railroaded him.

14:39.763 --> 14:43.848
No problem with the bathroom
upstairs.<i> Gracias,</i> Se?or Kevin.

14:43.934 --> 14:45.967
I will see you Monday.
Okay.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.969
Um, Ernesto, I'll walk you out.
Just want to...

14:48.054 --> 14:51.639
chat with you for a sec.
<i>Dígame,</i> Se?or Kevin.

14:51.725 --> 14:55.860
Um, Ernesto, I just, um...
You're doing a great job.

14:55.946 --> 14:59.447
Just one small issue. I would
rather if you didn't use...

14:59.482 --> 15:01.816
the bathroom in the house
anymore, okay?

15:01.868 --> 15:03.735
Oh.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.403
Oh, okay.
And I'd also prefer

15:05.488 --> 15:07.488
that you don't go
in the yard either.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.540
Excuse me?

15:09.626 --> 15:11.666
You think that I take a shit
outside like an animal?

15:11.745 --> 15:14.746
No! No, no. No! I'm just...

15:14.831 --> 15:17.665
I mean, I see what you consume
for lunch, and, you know,

15:17.717 --> 15:20.084
you've been using the bathroom,
like, five times a day,

15:20.170 --> 15:22.170
and two of those times
seemed really complicated...

15:22.172 --> 15:24.255
I do not poop in the lawn!

15:24.341 --> 15:27.892
Our rhododendrons did grow
four feet in a year.

15:27.978 --> 15:29.560
Se?or Kevin, I thought
we were family.

15:29.646 --> 15:32.347
Luis, Carmen, and Maria,
they call you Uncle Kevin!

15:32.399 --> 15:34.015
I've never met Maria.
You invite me to your house

15:34.067 --> 15:35.316
to use your toilet!

15:35.352 --> 15:36.601
That was a mistake. That...

15:36.686 --> 15:38.102
I should not have done that.
You know what,

15:38.188 --> 15:40.238
I'm not gonna work for somebody
that treats me like shit.

15:40.323 --> 15:42.857
I quit!
No. Ernesto, don't quit!

15:42.909 --> 15:44.492
You're taking this
the wrong way!

15:44.527 --> 15:46.327
Ernesto, please, wait, wait.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.029
Where do you go? Do you hold it?

15:48.081 --> 15:50.198
Ernesto, do you hold it?!

15:50.250 --> 15:52.367
Ernesto!

15:52.419 --> 15:55.169
Those rhododendrons
are gonna go to shit.

15:59.963 --> 16:00.728
Pete.

16:00.864 --> 16:02.080
What's up, Taco?

16:02.165 --> 16:03.364
Today you become a man,

16:03.450 --> 16:05.166
and I want you
to have something.

16:05.201 --> 16:06.751
This was mine.

16:06.836 --> 16:08.870
And before it was mine,

16:08.922 --> 16:11.005
it was someone else's
who left it in the garbage.

16:11.041 --> 16:12.540
And now it's yours.

16:12.592 --> 16:13.841
I'll always cherish it, Taco.

16:13.877 --> 16:15.593
Thank you.
You're ready for this.

16:15.678 --> 16:18.463
You got a good buzz going,
and you're carbo-loaded.

16:18.548 --> 16:20.389
And we're sure the pasta I ate
was gluten-free?

16:20.433 --> 16:21.682
Yeah. I didn't add any gluten
to it.

16:21.718 --> 16:23.851
This could be the race
of our lives, Pete.

16:25.722 --> 16:29.557
You're just smoking
like a Serbian water polo coach.

16:29.642 --> 16:31.559
Mmm.

16:31.644 --> 16:33.611
Yep. That'll help it.
Ah.

16:33.696 --> 16:35.897
Whew. I wish I
had what you had.

16:35.949 --> 16:37.732
A valid driver's license?

16:37.817 --> 16:39.067
Runners, please
report to the starting line.

16:39.152 --> 16:41.069
The race will begin
in five minutes.

16:41.121 --> 16:42.570
It is time. Here,
It's our time.

16:42.655 --> 16:44.288
takes the edge off.
No, I'll save room for the beer.

16:44.374 --> 16:45.623
I'm good.
All right. Let's do this.

16:45.708 --> 16:47.208
On your marks,

16:47.243 --> 16:49.043
get set...

16:57.470 --> 16:59.554
Come on, Pete! Chug!

16:59.589 --> 17:02.473
Chug! Chug! All right, let's do this, Pete!
Taco? Are you running?

17:02.559 --> 17:05.560
Think I'd let you do this alone?
Let's go, let's go!

17:05.595 --> 17:06.978
Jack and Coke?
Rum and Coke.

17:07.063 --> 17:08.563
Good call on the bar cart.
Thanks.

17:08.598 --> 17:09.931
It seemed like
the neighborly thing to do.

17:10.016 --> 17:11.766
What's up, jerks?
Wow.

17:11.851 --> 17:13.984
Another one.
Take a look.

17:14.069 --> 17:16.404
All in.
Andre, you are kiltin' it.

17:16.439 --> 17:18.772
You look like Lameheart.
You're looking at a winner,

17:18.858 --> 17:22.160
who is killing you today
because Brandin Cooks is

17:22.244 --> 17:24.862
cookin' up the field today.
He is killing it today.

17:24.948 --> 17:27.698
That's why it must hurt so bad
Ooh. So good.

17:27.784 --> 17:29.784
that he's on your bench.
Ooh.

17:29.869 --> 17:32.286
- He's not on my bench. He's
in my lineup. I set my lineup. - Nope.

17:32.372 --> 17:34.839
Mike Evans is in your lineup,
and he is not doing very well,

17:34.924 --> 17:36.457
my friend. In fact,

17:36.543 --> 17:38.126
I think you're gonna lose.

17:38.178 --> 17:39.844
Hi.
Hey.

17:39.929 --> 17:42.296
Um... did you touch my lineup?
What?

17:42.382 --> 17:44.799
Maybe...
No, no, no. No "maybe." Did you put Mike Evans

17:44.884 --> 17:45.800
in the lineup?
Yeah.

17:45.852 --> 17:47.552
You said I have final cut.

17:47.637 --> 17:49.053
I never said that.
Yes, you said in the closet

17:49.139 --> 17:50.855
that I get final cut.
I said that we shouldn't

17:50.940 --> 17:52.690
fight about fantasy football. You ca...
And if I don't have

17:52.775 --> 17:54.475
- final cut, we're gonna fight
about fantasy football. - You ca...

17:54.561 --> 17:56.227
So I get final cut.
No.

17:56.312 --> 17:58.479
Not on my team.
If you can't trust me with the flex,

17:58.531 --> 17:59.647
how can you trust me
with anything?

17:59.699 --> 18:00.865
How can you trust me
with your car?

18:00.950 --> 18:02.150
I don't trust you with my car!

18:02.152 --> 18:03.618
'Cause you dented my car!

18:03.653 --> 18:04.652
First of all, ding.

18:04.704 --> 18:06.320
A dent!
A ding!

18:06.406 --> 18:07.238
A dent!
A ding!

18:07.323 --> 18:08.990
A dent!
A valet

18:09.075 --> 18:10.992
dinged your car.
Oh! The valet.

18:11.077 --> 18:13.244
You parked in a compact spot!
I always tell you If you point at me,

18:13.329 --> 18:15.796
not to park in a compact, but...I mean, come on.
I'm gonna punch you in your kilt.

18:15.832 --> 18:18.352
Halfway there! Come on!
Get that cigarette out of my face, Taco.

18:24.591 --> 18:26.841
All right, inhale this.
Oh, God. Get out.

18:26.893 --> 18:28.643
I'm not sure
about that carbo-load.

18:28.678 --> 18:30.344
Might have been
the tomato sauce.

18:30.396 --> 18:32.063
Pretty sure
that was a clam sauce.

18:32.148 --> 18:34.849
Oh. Oh!

18:34.901 --> 18:37.185
Got to get to Kevin's! Got to get to Kevin's!
Wait, no, no, no.

18:37.270 --> 18:38.853
It's this way!
Where are you going? No, no,

18:38.905 --> 18:40.188
- no, no, no!
- What are you doing?!

18:40.273 --> 18:41.739
- Yobogoya!
<i>- Here's some</i>

18:41.824 --> 18:42.823
fearless feedback...Oh, you're gonna give me
Yeah, yeah,

18:42.859 --> 18:43.608
yeah, yeah.
some fearless feedback?

18:43.693 --> 18:44.609
It's "nitch,"

18:44.694 --> 18:46.244
not "neesh."

18:46.329 --> 18:47.528
It's "neesh." "Dinner theater
Oh, really?

18:47.614 --> 18:49.113
is my 'neesh.'"
No.

18:49.199 --> 18:51.032
"Dinner theatre is my 'nitch.'"

18:51.117 --> 18:52.416
"Neesh."
"Nitch."

18:52.502 --> 18:54.418
Neesh. Neesh. Neesh.
Nitch. Nitch.

18:54.504 --> 18:55.836
Nitch.
You're being

18:55.872 --> 18:57.288
a nitch right now.
And you're being

18:57.373 --> 18:58.172
a niotch.

18:58.208 --> 18:59.123
Oh, really?

18:59.209 --> 19:00.124
I hate your skorts.

19:00.210 --> 19:01.092
I hate your jeggings.

19:01.177 --> 19:02.376
You don't want me

19:02.428 --> 19:03.928
playing with your team,
messing with your team.

19:04.013 --> 19:05.963
You don't even want
me on your team.

19:06.049 --> 19:08.266
The only fantasy here
is that you and I

19:08.351 --> 19:11.269
were right for each other.
Maybe we're just too different.

19:11.354 --> 19:14.522
Maybe we are just two
completely different people.

19:14.557 --> 19:16.557
Different people.

19:16.609 --> 19:17.558
So on that,

19:17.644 --> 19:20.561
namaste. I'm going to go.

19:20.613 --> 19:22.280
It's been superlative.

19:22.365 --> 19:23.864
It was a pleasure having
a relationship with you.

19:23.900 --> 19:25.783
They were
perfect together,

19:25.868 --> 19:27.368
and the flex tore them apart.

19:27.403 --> 19:29.820
The flex can do that.

19:29.906 --> 19:31.322
Hey, Andre.

19:31.407 --> 19:33.824
How you doing, buddy?

19:33.910 --> 19:37.211
I lost my love and my matchup.

19:37.247 --> 19:39.046
I'm really sorry
about the first one.

19:39.082 --> 19:40.798
She can be a cruel,
cruel mistress.

19:40.883 --> 19:43.334
Meegan?
No, fantasy football.

19:43.419 --> 19:45.253
Where's Pete?

19:45.338 --> 19:47.088
I got to get to Kevin's!
I'm gonna make it!

19:47.140 --> 19:48.723
What are you doing?!
We're off-course!

19:48.758 --> 19:50.808
No, there's a new course!
New course!

19:59.269 --> 20:01.352
Kevin! It's an emergency!
Open up!

20:01.437 --> 20:03.271
Come on! Hey, hey!

20:03.356 --> 20:05.156
Hey, Kevin! Kevin!

20:05.241 --> 20:06.607
Where are you?!

20:06.659 --> 20:08.526
Oh, God.

20:08.611 --> 20:10.161
Oh, God.

20:10.246 --> 20:11.612
Oh, no.

20:16.035 --> 20:17.835
Oh! Ooh, ooh.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.254
No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no.

20:20.290 --> 20:21.922
No. Oh...

20:21.958 --> 20:25.960
Yobogoya. Oh, sweet Yobogoya.

20:26.045 --> 20:29.213
Welcome to Poo Corner.
I love it here. Whew.

20:29.299 --> 20:31.265
Oh, Kevin.
<i>?Qué es esto?</i>

20:31.385 --> 20:32.355
<i>El cabrón.</i>

20:32.475 --> 20:34.135
I'm so sorry. Definitely will be
blaming this one on the dog.

20:36.306 --> 20:38.022
You are the shitter!

20:38.107 --> 20:40.858
I'm gonna tell Se?or Kevin!
Because of you,

20:40.943 --> 20:43.694
I lost my job!

20:43.780 --> 20:45.700
It's not what you think!
It's not what you think!

20:45.732 --> 20:47.620
No, no, no.
What are you doing?

20:47.740 --> 20:50.735
Shitting yourself is an automatic DQ.

20:50.985 --> 20:53.138
Rolling around in it is
just killing your time.

20:53.258 --> 20:55.767
No respect for the sport.
