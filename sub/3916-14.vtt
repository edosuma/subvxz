WEBVTT

00:00.394 --> 00:02.355
Previously on The Fosters...

00:02.390 --> 00:03.940
We are not friends. We are colleagues.

00:03.942 --> 00:05.775
Having the BRCA 1 gene

00:05.827 --> 00:07.877
increases my chances of
getting breast cancer.

00:07.912 --> 00:09.762
- You must be new here.
- Hey, I'm Nick.

00:09.848 --> 00:10.847
That's gotta be your dad!

00:10.882 --> 00:12.849
That guy said I was
supposed to help you.

00:12.851 --> 00:14.851
I don't want you in my musical,

00:14.886 --> 00:16.919
but you were hands down the best Juliet.

00:16.955 --> 00:18.921
Did you talk to anyone about
me? 'Cause I just got taken away

00:18.957 --> 00:20.790
from my foster family and
put in a group home.

00:20.792 --> 00:21.858
That your brother's wetsuit?

00:21.893 --> 00:23.142
Do you make fun of all of your students?

00:23.178 --> 00:24.811
Just the most promising ones.

00:24.863 --> 00:26.114
I'm sorry I left without saying goodbye.

00:26.139 --> 00:26.829
But we've been IMing.

00:26.865 --> 00:29.225
I don't know who you've been
talking to, but it's not me.

00:29.234 --> 00:31.134
- We're leaving.
- I can't run anymore.

00:31.169 --> 00:33.489
AJ, we're gonna have
to take you in for running away.

00:39.828 --> 00:42.044
Um, my name is Callie Jac...

00:42.096 --> 00:44.180
uh, Adams Foster.

00:44.215 --> 00:46.732
Sorry. I just got
adopted so I changed my name.

00:49.154 --> 00:52.121
Uh, I'm here to see AJ Hensdale.

00:52.173 --> 00:54.090
Anthony Joseph Hensdale.

00:57.111 --> 00:58.227
You're not on his list.

00:58.263 --> 01:01.030
I called and spoke to someone.

01:01.032 --> 01:03.966
I see your request, but
you're not on here.

01:04.001 --> 01:05.101
So what does that mean?

01:05.135 --> 01:07.069
He doesn't want to see you.

01:12.076 --> 01:15.845
We're doing what we call
a skin sparing mastectomy.

01:15.897 --> 01:18.915
We remove the nipple and the areola,

01:18.950 --> 01:20.950
and we take the breast
tissue out through here,

01:20.985 --> 01:23.002
leaving the skin to form an envelope

01:23.037 --> 01:26.022
that will help create the
reconstructed breast.

01:27.809 --> 01:29.825
We'll then insert tissue expanders

01:29.861 --> 01:31.911
underneath the
muscles of your chest wall.

01:31.946 --> 01:34.897
All right, now once you heal,
your plastic surgeon will begin

01:34.933 --> 01:36.716
filling them with saline

01:36.768 --> 01:38.768
over the course of six to eight weeks.

01:49.230 --> 01:50.813
Any questions?

01:50.848 --> 01:52.815
Mrs. Adams Foster?

01:54.886 --> 01:56.185
Nope.

02:45.853 --> 02:47.136
How'd it go?

02:48.222 --> 02:50.106
Fine. It went fine.

02:51.809 --> 02:55.144
And when are you gonna...

02:55.146 --> 02:56.862
Um, next week hopefully.

02:56.898 --> 02:59.148
I think we should tell the kids.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.565
Uh, no. I think we should just wait

03:00.590 --> 03:01.817
till they schedule the surgery.

03:01.819 --> 03:04.153
You know, less time for them
to wait and worry, the better.

03:04.155 --> 03:06.122
- So...
- Mama.

03:06.157 --> 03:09.792
Are you having an affair with
the principal of our school?

03:09.827 --> 03:12.187
Is that why you're having all
of these private conversations

03:12.196 --> 03:14.080
behind closed doors and whispering

03:14.132 --> 03:15.715
and why Grandma won't leave?

03:16.834 --> 03:18.834
No, I am not having
an affair with Monte.

03:18.836 --> 03:20.720
Where did... where did you hear this?

03:20.755 --> 03:21.755
It's all over Twitter.

03:21.756 --> 03:22.756
Twitter?

03:28.763 --> 03:30.179
- Who... who did this?
- Who knows?

03:30.181 --> 03:31.731
But everyone's retweeting it.

03:32.850 --> 03:34.767
- It is kind of funny.
- Mom.

03:34.819 --> 03:36.852
No, it's not funny or true.

03:36.854 --> 03:38.738
Just ignore it, okay?

03:38.773 --> 03:41.107
- It's gonna go away. Trust me.
- She's right.

03:41.159 --> 03:44.694
Otherwise, it'll look
like she doth protest too much.

03:45.830 --> 03:47.863
One thing I can do is start
a Twitter campaign

03:47.865 --> 03:51.834
to ♪stopmakingupliesaboutmymom. ♪

03:51.869 --> 03:53.119
Or...

03:53.171 --> 03:54.754
you know, something better than that.

04:00.178 --> 04:01.711
I'm sorry.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.045
- No.
- I'm sorry.

04:04.716 --> 04:05.716
Hey, Cal?

04:05.717 --> 04:07.083
Callie?

04:07.101 --> 04:08.101
Did you...

04:08.136 --> 04:10.803
did you get a chance to see AJ?

04:10.855 --> 04:13.723
No, he doesn't want
to see me thanks to you.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.057
Okay, Cal. Listen...

04:15.109 --> 04:16.726
I told you where AJ was

04:16.761 --> 04:19.111
because I thought I was talking
to my mother, not a cop.

04:19.147 --> 04:21.113
Obviously, there's no difference.

04:21.165 --> 04:22.765
Please watch your tone.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.150
I'm sorry if you don't like
my tone, but I lost a friend

04:24.202 --> 04:25.735
because you weren't honest with me.

04:25.787 --> 04:26.787
Callie.

04:28.156 --> 04:30.706
It's fine. Let her have her feelings.

04:30.742 --> 04:32.742
Apparently AJ is
refusing to see Mike too.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.110
What's gonna happen to him?

04:34.128 --> 04:36.746
Well, he may end up in youth
authority if he's not careful.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.164
I'm...

04:38.216 --> 04:40.082
All right, I'm gonna go change.

04:40.134 --> 04:43.753
Well, I believe you have a...

04:43.755 --> 04:45.721
call to return,

04:45.757 --> 04:47.757
so I'll give you some privacy.

04:51.846 --> 04:54.730
All right, so we're gonna
build a wall over here.

04:54.766 --> 04:57.767
Just get me... five two-by-fours

04:57.819 --> 04:59.101
and pick the straightest ones.

04:59.153 --> 05:00.186
Okay.

05:00.238 --> 05:02.738
Where'd you learn to do all this stuff?

05:02.774 --> 05:05.741
On site, same as you.

05:05.777 --> 05:07.109
- Oh.
- You're gonna place those

05:07.161 --> 05:09.111
16 inches apart on the ground.

05:09.113 --> 05:11.697
We're gonna build a wall on the ground?

05:11.749 --> 05:13.115
That's easier. You'll see.

05:13.117 --> 05:15.751
Did you... you grow up around here?

05:17.171 --> 05:19.088
Near here.

05:19.123 --> 05:21.123
Where'd you go to high school?

05:21.125 --> 05:23.793
Jefferson for a while.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.678
What year did you graduate?

05:25.713 --> 05:28.097
I didn't.

05:28.132 --> 05:29.247
- That's cool.
- Now you think

05:29.272 --> 05:30.800
dropping out of high school is cool?

05:30.802 --> 05:32.768
Uh, no. No.

05:32.804 --> 05:34.136
I just... I mean... No, I just...

05:35.807 --> 05:37.723
You got a big family?

05:37.775 --> 05:38.808
Look, you ever use one of these?

05:38.810 --> 05:40.693
No.

05:40.728 --> 05:42.144
This one time, I
wasn't paying attention,

05:42.196 --> 05:44.730
gun bounced off a
stud, hit me in the head.

05:44.782 --> 05:45.815
I got 15 stitches.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.734
So I should stop asking you questions?

05:48.786 --> 05:50.703
Personal ones.

05:50.738 --> 05:52.705
If you wanna learn something, you ask.

05:52.740 --> 05:53.823
All right? You want to chit chat,

05:53.875 --> 05:55.157
work with one of the other guys.

05:55.159 --> 05:57.793
Yeah, okay. I mean, I
want to work with you.

05:57.829 --> 05:59.078
All right, man.

05:59.130 --> 06:00.250
Go grab me some more boards.

06:04.752 --> 06:05.752
Ah!

06:19.734 --> 06:20.734
Great. Thanks.

06:46.143 --> 06:48.177
- Your usual?
- Sure.

06:48.212 --> 06:50.713
Love that last song. What's it from?

06:50.748 --> 06:54.133
H, you know, the Brandon
Foster roken Heart Collection.

06:55.803 --> 06:58.103
I wrote it for that
girl that I told you about.

06:58.139 --> 06:59.806
Ah.

07:00.775 --> 07:02.024
Thanks.

07:02.059 --> 07:05.094
Hey, what'd they... what'd
they call this again?

07:05.129 --> 07:07.029
A Shirley Temple.

07:07.064 --> 07:09.098
Is that, like, a person or...

07:09.133 --> 07:10.604
Wait, you don't know who

07:10.629 --> 07:12.134
- Shirley Temple is?
- No.

07:12.169 --> 07:15.704
She's, like, the most
famous child star of all time.

07:15.706 --> 07:17.146
She sang Animal Crackers in My Soup.

07:17.174 --> 07:20.142
Right. So, you're saying this is,
like, a little girl's drink.

07:20.177 --> 07:21.944
You know, I think it takes

07:21.979 --> 07:23.062
a real man to order a Shirley Temple.

07:23.114 --> 07:25.948
Why does this suddenly feel
like surfing all over again?

07:25.983 --> 07:27.967
I think you just like making
fun of me. Really.

07:28.002 --> 07:29.885
Uh...

07:29.937 --> 07:31.086
don't forget you
have inventory tomorrow.

07:31.122 --> 07:32.703
Yeah. All over it.

07:36.127 --> 07:37.860
Aren't we closed tomorrow?

07:37.895 --> 07:40.062
Yeah. He won't let me do inventory
during business hours,

07:40.097 --> 07:45.034
so I get to come in alone with
the ghosts of the early bird special.

07:45.069 --> 07:47.036
Wait, is this... You think
this place is haunted?

07:47.071 --> 07:48.837
Oh, yeah. I know it is.

07:50.858 --> 07:53.776
Well, I'd love to see a ghost.

07:53.811 --> 07:55.778
- Can I help?
- Seriously?

07:55.813 --> 07:56.912
You don't have better things to do?

07:56.914 --> 08:00.749
Other things to do, but not better.

08:03.771 --> 08:05.721
It's so professional.

08:05.756 --> 08:06.756
It is.

08:06.791 --> 08:09.792
We're averaging over
10,000 users a week.

08:09.794 --> 08:12.127
Just wait till we launch the phone app.

08:12.129 --> 08:14.647
Oh, um, actually,

08:14.699 --> 08:17.700
I've been getting some emails from kids

08:17.735 --> 08:19.802
saying that they have
been having some trouble

08:19.837 --> 08:24.690
uploading their content or when
they do sometimes, it disappears.

08:24.725 --> 08:26.141
Well, I'll talk to our moderators.

08:26.177 --> 08:28.077
It might be that the
content was inappropriate.

08:28.112 --> 08:30.746
- Uh, we have moderators?
- Of course.

08:30.781 --> 08:34.116
Okay, it's just the whole
point of Fost and Found is so that

08:34.150 --> 08:38.020
kids have a place to
tell their stories uncensored.

08:38.022 --> 08:40.089
Moderation isn't censorship.

08:40.124 --> 08:42.006
It's a way to keep it a safe place

08:42.043 --> 08:46.061
for kids to speak up and
not be bullied or shamed.

08:46.097 --> 08:49.064
For example, someone recently made

08:49.066 --> 08:50.899
an ugly accusation about you

08:50.951 --> 08:53.919
and we took it down.

08:53.971 --> 08:54.971
What'd they say?

08:55.006 --> 08:57.006
That you had sex with
your Foster brother.

08:57.041 --> 08:58.511
Which of course is not true, but that's

08:58.536 --> 08:59.932
the sort of thing I'm talking about.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.043
We don't want people trying

09:01.078 --> 09:02.945
to tear you down with lies, do we?

09:02.980 --> 09:04.013
No.

09:04.048 --> 09:06.932
You know, or misrepresenting themselves.

09:06.967 --> 09:08.901
Like whoever's
pretending to be your friend, AJ.

09:10.037 --> 09:11.854
Look, I hope you don't mind.

09:11.889 --> 09:16.759
But I had my programmers
track their IP address,

09:16.794 --> 09:17.960
and it belongs to someone you know.

09:17.995 --> 09:19.728
Who?

09:19.764 --> 09:21.764
Your brother, Jude.

09:29.974 --> 09:31.006
Hey.

09:31.042 --> 09:32.975
What are you doing?

09:33.010 --> 09:34.944
Checking my email.

09:36.881 --> 09:38.831
On Jude's computer?

09:38.866 --> 09:40.783
He said I could use it.

09:40.818 --> 09:42.852
Did he say you could
use it to catfish me?

09:42.887 --> 09:44.787
I...

09:45.857 --> 09:46.857
I don't... I don't...

09:46.891 --> 09:48.190
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:48.226 --> 09:49.859
We traced everything
back to Jude's computer

09:49.911 --> 09:51.827
and I know it wasn't my brother.

09:51.829 --> 09:52.829
It was you, wasn't it?

09:52.880 --> 09:54.880
I'm... I'm sorry. I...
I... I... I didn't mean...

09:54.932 --> 09:57.183
To pretend to be somebody else?

09:57.235 --> 09:58.868
- Was it an accident?
- No, it's just...

09:58.903 --> 10:01.136
you... you posted those pictures

10:01.172 --> 10:03.172
and... and you
looked really pretty, so...

10:03.207 --> 10:05.090
so I was just saying you
looked super, Callie,

10:05.142 --> 10:06.225
like the drawing on your wall...

10:06.260 --> 10:08.260
But you let me sit in a
coffee shop waiting for AJ.

10:08.312 --> 10:10.196
Yeah, I know!

10:10.248 --> 10:12.081
I was there.

10:12.116 --> 10:14.083
You were there, so
are... are you stalking me?

10:14.135 --> 10:17.219
No, I was just gonna come
by to tell you that it was...

10:17.271 --> 10:20.155
that it was me, and... and
you were talking to this guy

10:20.191 --> 10:22.074
and then you came outside and took off.

10:22.126 --> 10:23.209
Okay, Mom. I will.

10:23.261 --> 10:25.211
Please don't tell Jude.

10:25.263 --> 10:27.096
He won't be my friend.

10:30.017 --> 10:31.066
Hey.

10:31.102 --> 10:32.102
Are you going?

10:32.153 --> 10:34.203
- Yeah.
- Wait, you're bleeding.

10:34.238 --> 10:37.006
Oh, it's... it's okay.

10:37.058 --> 10:38.090
Let me see.

10:40.194 --> 10:42.011
What happened to you?

10:44.949 --> 10:45.965
I... I fell.

10:46.017 --> 10:47.950
You didn't get those
bruises from falling.

10:47.985 --> 10:49.985
- Did you get beat up?
- Who did this to you?

10:50.021 --> 10:53.906
Some of the older
boys in the group home.

10:53.958 --> 10:55.925
Do your supervisors know about this?

10:55.960 --> 10:56.960
They don't care.

10:56.994 --> 10:58.354
Well, you're not going back there.

10:58.362 --> 11:00.312
Our mom's a cop. She can help you.

11:00.348 --> 11:01.897
No, no. Please, please.

11:01.933 --> 11:02.965
If they can't find another place,

11:03.000 --> 11:03.983
they're gonna put me in juvie.

11:04.035 --> 11:05.868
It's... it's okay. It was my fault.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.804
If I... if I just keep my mouth
shut, I'll... I'll be fine.

11:08.839 --> 11:10.222
I... I gotta go.

11:12.927 --> 11:14.810
Jude, he's right.

11:14.812 --> 11:15.861
He can end up in juvie.

11:15.896 --> 11:17.246
Mom wouldn't let that happen.

11:17.281 --> 11:19.798
AJ is in juvie right now because of her,

11:19.834 --> 11:21.884
so we don't know what she'll do.

11:37.868 --> 11:39.201
Everybody up and out?

11:39.236 --> 11:41.236
Ugh, it's like herding cats.

11:43.174 --> 11:44.374
You're not going to work today?

11:44.375 --> 11:47.142
No. I have a couple of
things I'd like to get done before...

11:47.194 --> 11:49.278
I'm out of commission.

11:53.284 --> 11:55.200
Everything's gonna be fine, you know.

11:55.225 --> 11:56.085
I know, I know.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.020
- It's fine.
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

11:59.190 --> 12:01.023
But just in case something
does happen, Ma,

12:01.025 --> 12:02.992
I'd like to give you
my power of attorney,

12:02.994 --> 12:05.077
if that's all right with you.

12:05.129 --> 12:07.046
Well...

12:07.081 --> 12:09.932
first of all, nothing's gonna go wrong.

12:09.984 --> 12:13.018
I know, I know, but I mean, it's
just... got to be prepared, Mom.

12:13.070 --> 12:14.903
Why aren't you asking your wife?

12:14.939 --> 12:17.906
- Are you... are you having problems?
- No.

12:17.908 --> 12:18.908
- No?
- No.

12:18.959 --> 12:19.958
- Is she having an affair?
- No.

12:20.011 --> 12:21.910
- Mother, we're fine.
- Are you sure?

12:21.946 --> 12:23.293
Why are you asking this?

12:23.318 --> 12:25.955
I'm just saying,
since I've been here, I...

12:25.983 --> 12:28.083
I haven't seen much
affection between the two of you.

12:29.878 --> 12:32.078
Just because you're in lust
with Will right now, Mother,

12:32.089 --> 12:34.006
doesn't mean everyone else is, you know.

12:34.041 --> 12:39.011
Well, just make sure that you
have sex before the surgery.

12:39.063 --> 12:40.979
Mother.

12:41.032 --> 12:42.998
- Oh, my...
- What? It's important.

12:43.034 --> 12:44.967
I know how you get when you're...

12:45.002 --> 12:46.919
you're scared and overwhelmed.

12:46.954 --> 12:48.871
You just want to batten hatches

12:48.923 --> 12:51.907
and weather the storm alone.

12:52.977 --> 12:54.860
Don't...

12:55.946 --> 12:58.313
don't make that a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.222
Whoa, so your dad's alive, dude?

13:07.274 --> 13:08.774
Birth dad.

13:08.809 --> 13:10.192
So you're gonna tell him who you are.

13:10.227 --> 13:12.227
Uh, I don't think so.

13:12.229 --> 13:13.896
Why not? Is he cool?

13:13.931 --> 13:15.164
I mean, he's pretty cool.

13:15.216 --> 13:17.249
So then man up and tell him.

13:17.301 --> 13:18.834
- You man up.
- What the...

13:18.886 --> 13:20.169
- Oh!
- Ow!

13:20.221 --> 13:22.171
Sorry. He... he pushed me.

13:22.223 --> 13:23.806
God, what is your problem?

13:23.841 --> 13:25.808
You act like you're nine
years old. Seriously.

13:25.860 --> 13:28.160
- Grow up.
- Mariana?

13:29.830 --> 13:32.281
- Hey, Sally.
- I'm sorry about the election.

13:32.283 --> 13:34.249
I thought you should have won.

13:34.301 --> 13:36.168
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

13:36.220 --> 13:40.189
Anyway, I'd love for you to be
a part of my administration

13:40.224 --> 13:42.141
as Chair of the Honor Board.

13:42.193 --> 13:43.826
I'd love to.

13:43.861 --> 13:46.161
Wow. Thank you so
much for thinking of me.

13:46.197 --> 13:48.130
Thank you! We'll talk later.

13:48.165 --> 13:49.248
Gotta run.

13:49.300 --> 13:53.268
Being Chair of the
Honor Board is no honor.

13:53.304 --> 13:55.237
You're in charge of punishing students.

13:55.272 --> 13:59.041
But hey, if you're trying to
win an unpopularity contest...

13:59.076 --> 14:00.142
Yeah, just don't expect to get,

14:00.177 --> 14:02.177
like, another date for
the rest of high school.

14:02.213 --> 14:04.179
Okay, Dumb and Dumber,

14:04.215 --> 14:06.048
don't you have remedial
something to get to?

14:09.120 --> 14:10.480
You're not on the visitation list.

14:12.123 --> 14:13.989
All right, well, will
you please tell him

14:14.024 --> 14:14.990
that I'll be back tomorrow?

14:15.025 --> 14:16.745
I'll put in your request.

14:18.012 --> 14:19.061
Thank you.

14:21.148 --> 14:24.032
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

14:24.068 --> 14:26.902
What satisfaction canst
thou have tonight?

14:26.954 --> 14:29.872
The exchange of thy
love's faithful vow for mine.

14:30.975 --> 14:33.926
Uh, can we save the
kiss for the performance?

14:33.978 --> 14:35.944
Yeah, that's, that's fine.

14:35.980 --> 14:38.063
Um, okay. Zoey, let's
rehearse the new song.

14:40.117 --> 14:42.918
Matt, your Shakespeare is so good.

14:42.953 --> 14:44.887
Maybe we could get together later

14:44.922 --> 14:46.088
and you could help me with
my iambic pentameter.

14:46.090 --> 14:47.823
Sure.

14:51.896 --> 14:54.830
So, I was thinking, as
director of the play,

14:54.865 --> 14:56.832
I think you should lay
down a no-dating policy

14:56.867 --> 14:57.900
between cast and crew.

14:57.935 --> 15:00.002
You know, to save the
drama for the stage.

15:00.004 --> 15:01.854
Right. Is that what you think then?

15:01.889 --> 15:03.238
- For the good of the play?
- Yes.

15:03.274 --> 15:04.773
No. Mariana, no.

15:04.825 --> 15:05.941
If you can't handle working with Mat,

15:05.943 --> 15:08.827
then we'll just cast Talya as Juliet,

15:08.863 --> 15:11.166
you know, assuming she's
still speaking to me,

15:11.167 --> 15:12.847
- and then you d...
- All right, all right.

15:12.883 --> 15:14.249
Don't get all crazy.

15:14.251 --> 15:15.801
I'm totally fine.

15:15.853 --> 15:17.186
Okay. Good.

15:17.221 --> 15:18.887

Hey.

15:57.294 --> 15:59.161
What's going on?

15:59.196 --> 16:01.096
This is Justina.

16:01.098 --> 16:03.115
She is a Foster care advocate

16:03.150 --> 16:05.150
not a social worker or a cop,

16:05.202 --> 16:07.102
so you can trust her.

16:07.137 --> 16:09.087
Hey, Jack.

16:09.123 --> 16:12.174
So Callie told me what's
been happening in your group home,

16:12.176 --> 16:15.143
and I'd like to help
you if you want me to.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.000
Are they beating you up?

16:22.052 --> 16:23.085
Show her.

16:32.062 --> 16:34.930
They are in serious
violation of their license.

16:34.965 --> 16:35.998
They could potentially get shut down.

16:36.050 --> 16:38.900
But at the very least, I
can get you out of there.

16:38.936 --> 16:39.936
Then where will I go?

16:39.970 --> 16:41.970
Someplace safe. I'll
make sure of it this time.

16:42.022 --> 16:44.973
I can get us an appointment
at social services tomorrow.

16:44.992 --> 16:46.108
You just have to show them your bruises

16:46.110 --> 16:47.943
and tell them what happened.

16:47.995 --> 16:49.995
She won't let them send
you back to juvie.

16:53.083 --> 16:54.850
Okay.

16:54.885 --> 16:57.853
Good. Are you okay
spending one more night there?

16:57.905 --> 16:59.988
- I know how to lay low.
- Okay.

17:00.024 --> 17:01.790
So I'll tell Callie where and when,

17:01.825 --> 17:02.874
and I will see you tomorrow.

17:02.910 --> 17:05.761
Still want to hang out?

17:05.796 --> 17:06.796
Come on.

17:06.847 --> 17:07.878
Sure.

17:09.933 --> 17:11.849
Hey, um, sorry...

17:11.885 --> 17:13.769
what did you mean when you said

17:13.820 --> 17:15.737
you'll make sure he's safe this time?

17:15.789 --> 17:17.045
I thought you had nothing to do with him

17:17.069 --> 17:18.240
getting pulled out of his other home.

17:18.275 --> 17:20.876
Well, I didn't, but
someone did last time,

17:20.928 --> 17:22.911
and I'll make sure it
doesn't happen again this time.

17:22.945 --> 17:24.762
I mean, it's just an expression, Callie.

17:25.883 --> 17:26.883
I'll text you later.

17:31.872 --> 17:33.188
Is Stef upset?

17:33.223 --> 17:34.256
No, she...

17:34.291 --> 17:35.857
she knows it's not true.

17:35.893 --> 17:36.893
Well, good.

17:36.927 --> 17:39.161
I think we should just ignore it,

17:39.196 --> 17:41.780
not dignify it with
any sort of response.

17:41.815 --> 17:43.231
Yeah, that's what Stef thinks too.

17:43.233 --> 17:44.783
Yeah, she's right.

17:44.818 --> 17:46.802
I mean, kids make up
stories about their teachers

17:46.837 --> 17:48.253
and their principals all the time.

17:48.305 --> 17:52.107
When I was in grade
school, we spread this rumor

17:52.142 --> 17:54.810
that our music teacher was having
an affair with his T.A.

17:54.845 --> 17:56.278
Of course in his case it was true

17:56.280 --> 18:00.082
and he ended up divorcing his wife.

18:00.117 --> 18:01.117
But...

18:01.151 --> 18:04.019
Did you send that tweet?

18:04.054 --> 18:05.087
What?

18:06.156 --> 18:07.156
D...

18:07.191 --> 18:09.991
Do you think I would do
something like that?

18:11.161 --> 18:12.161
No.

18:13.197 --> 18:16.048
I... I don't even know why
I said that. I'm sorry.

18:18.052 --> 18:20.185
I'm just a little stressed out.

18:20.237 --> 18:23.171
About this or something else?

18:28.045 --> 18:29.077
Stef.

18:38.122 --> 18:40.038
- I'm sorry.
- No.

18:45.045 --> 18:47.929
She... she...

18:49.933 --> 18:53.869
she needs to have a surgery.

18:53.904 --> 18:55.837
So...

18:55.873 --> 18:58.039
I'm gonna need to
take at least a week off

18:58.041 --> 18:59.908
if that's okay.

18:59.943 --> 19:01.777
Of course.

19:13.791 --> 19:14.956
Is it serious?

19:14.992 --> 19:16.858
Um...

19:18.228 --> 19:20.862
she's... she's gonna be fine.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.764
She's gonna be fine.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.783
I'm so sorry. I didn't, um...

19:25.936 --> 19:27.886
I didn't mean to overstep.

19:30.941 --> 19:33.809
Of course you can take all
the time off you need.

19:33.844 --> 19:35.160
Thank you.

20:01.064 --> 20:03.014
Okay, stop it! I'm gonna throw up!

20:03.066 --> 20:04.066
Not until you man up!

20:05.068 --> 20:06.985
Okay, okay, okay!

20:07.037 --> 20:08.397
I'll do it, I'll do it! Just stop!

20:12.926 --> 20:14.092
You are such an ass.

20:15.679 --> 20:16.961
Someday you're gonna say,

20:17.013 --> 20:18.096
"Thank you, Nick. Because of you,

20:18.148 --> 20:21.015
I have a relationship with my father.

20:21.067 --> 20:23.868
Uh, birth father."

20:24.988 --> 20:26.037
Yeah, we'll see.

20:30.010 --> 20:31.843
You guys want to get out of the car?

20:33.063 --> 20:35.063
0.5.

20:35.065 --> 20:36.948
0.5.

20:36.983 --> 20:38.232
Having fun yet?

20:38.234 --> 20:40.902
Well, I mean, don't most
places use, like, a computer for this?

20:40.937 --> 20:43.838
Most places aren't stuck in the 1940s.

20:44.908 --> 20:47.842
Speaking of which, where
are all those ghosts?

20:47.894 --> 20:48.976
Hm.

20:48.978 --> 20:51.779
Oh, that's weird. Maybe
they don't like you.

20:51.831 --> 20:53.881
What is not to like?

20:53.917 --> 20:55.917
I agree.

20:55.919 --> 20:57.885
- Wait a minute.
- What?

20:57.921 --> 21:00.772
No, I'm... I'm picking
up on, like, a presence.

21:02.726 --> 21:03.758
It's a little girl.

21:03.793 --> 21:06.711
She's got curls...

21:06.746 --> 21:09.747
a high-pitched voice, and
she's... she's calling me.

21:09.799 --> 21:11.359

don't want to kiss you.

22:05.705 --> 22:06.971
It's just...

22:08.641 --> 22:09.974
it's complicated.

22:10.009 --> 22:11.092
Why?

22:14.998 --> 22:17.031
Well, first of all, I'm older than you.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.083
By a few years. No big deal.

22:19.119 --> 22:21.002
And we're both on the rebound.

22:21.054 --> 22:23.905
I thought you were over your ex.

22:23.940 --> 22:24.972
I am,

22:25.008 --> 22:29.911
but it's pretty clear that
you aren't of yours.

22:32.112 --> 22:34.048
Uh, yeah, you know, go
back there and help

22:34.083 --> 22:35.883
and I'll be back there in a little bit.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.084
Hey!

22:37.086 --> 22:38.886
Nick.

22:39.973 --> 22:41.856
Thought you might not show up today.

22:41.891 --> 22:42.891
Yeah, sorry about that.

22:42.942 --> 22:43.991
I had something after school.

22:44.027 --> 22:45.910
Um, school?

22:46.996 --> 22:48.830
You a senior?

22:48.865 --> 22:49.914
Yeah.

22:51.050 --> 22:53.801
- Um...
- Let's get to work.

22:54.971 --> 22:56.938
Here.

22:56.973 --> 22:58.856
- What's this?
- It's my old belt.

22:58.908 --> 22:59.991
Try it on.

23:00.026 --> 23:02.743
It's not safe to walk
around with tools in your pockets.

23:20.930 --> 23:23.764
Hey, just the girl I wanted to see.

23:23.766 --> 23:24.849
Yeah, right.

23:24.901 --> 23:26.767
No, seriously. I wanted to apologize.

23:26.820 --> 23:28.769
Look, I'm just trying to fit in, okay?

23:28.822 --> 23:30.872
It's hard coming to a
new school junior year.

23:30.874 --> 23:32.673
I was just trying to make a friend

23:32.709 --> 23:35.710
by acting like a
smart-ass and teasing a sister,

23:35.762 --> 23:37.812
'cause I like you

23:37.847 --> 23:40.097
and you intimidate me.

23:42.819 --> 23:44.652
Why?

23:44.687 --> 23:48.122
You're smart. Confident.

23:48.124 --> 23:50.675
I am?

23:50.727 --> 23:53.060
You're just about the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen.

23:57.166 --> 24:00.668
And now that I've made a
complete idiot of myself,

24:00.703 --> 24:04.605
maybe we can go out
sometime, get some fries or something?

24:06.693 --> 24:07.693
Maybe.

24:16.636 --> 24:18.085
Oh, hi.

24:18.087 --> 24:20.087
I'm making spaghetti and
meatballs for dinner.

24:20.123 --> 24:21.055
I hope that's okay.

24:21.090 --> 24:23.074
That's fantastic. Thank you.

24:25.028 --> 24:27.995
Nothing's gonna happen, but
I just want you to know

24:28.047 --> 24:31.999
that whatever
decisions might need to be made,

24:32.035 --> 24:34.068
of course we would... we
would make them together.

24:34.103 --> 24:36.637
About what?

24:36.673 --> 24:40.074
Didn't Stef talk to you about
her power of attorney?

24:41.144 --> 24:42.877
Yeah. Yeah.

24:42.912 --> 24:44.128
Oh, good.

24:44.180 --> 24:46.931
Because she said she was gonna
go over to the school at lunch.

24:46.966 --> 24:48.966
I thought I might have
put my foot in my mouth again.

24:49.018 --> 24:51.819
So you're all right with everything?

24:51.871 --> 24:52.904
Not to worry.

24:52.956 --> 24:55.840
Oh, good, because I
don't want there to be

24:55.875 --> 24:57.008
any tension between us.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.960
It's all good.

24:58.995 --> 24:59.927
Thank you for making dinner.

24:59.979 --> 25:02.763
I'm just gonna go wash up.

25:02.815 --> 25:03.931
Take your time.

25:03.983 --> 25:06.767
I got everything under control.

25:10.873 --> 25:11.873
You okay?

25:14.944 --> 25:16.877
I didn't sleep well last night.

25:18.948 --> 25:20.848
Is there anything I can do?

25:21.918 --> 25:23.784
Just need some rest.

25:30.777 --> 25:31.859
Okay.

25:41.132 --> 25:43.966
Why do girls inflict so
much pain on themselves

25:44.001 --> 25:45.100
just to look pretty?

25:45.102 --> 25:47.102
Well, we can't all rock a unibrow.

25:47.154 --> 25:48.988
What? I do not have a unibrow.

25:49.023 --> 25:51.040
Whatever you have to tell yourself.

25:51.075 --> 25:52.341
Wow.

25:54.011 --> 25:57.346
You ever been
curious about our birth dad?

25:57.348 --> 25:59.081
- Why? Are you?
- I don't know.

25:59.116 --> 26:03.285
Do ever think he might
not have been Latino?

26:03.321 --> 26:04.954
No.

26:04.989 --> 26:06.956
Why are you
thinking about our birth dad?

26:06.991 --> 26:08.958
You've never been interested
in knowing anything about him.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.960
I don't know. Nick was asking questions.

26:10.995 --> 26:12.945
Well, you don't have to answer them.

26:12.980 --> 26:14.229
Tell him it's personal.

26:16.901 --> 26:19.952
Yeah, well, speaking of
Nick, I know you hate him, but...

26:20.004 --> 26:21.203
He's not so bad.

26:22.306 --> 26:23.339
Oh.

26:23.374 --> 26:25.924
Well, good, because he just got busted

26:25.977 --> 26:28.260
for doing donuts in
the school parking lot

26:28.312 --> 26:31.196
and he's being sent to
your honor board tomorrow,

26:31.248 --> 26:33.248
so go easy on him, okay?

26:35.252 --> 26:37.252
Sure.

26:37.254 --> 26:38.387
I'll see what I can do.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.301
I told you I needed the
car after school today.

26:52.303 --> 26:54.269
Uh, I don't remember
that, and actually I need it

26:54.305 --> 26:56.105
to get to work after rehearsal.

26:56.140 --> 26:57.406
Well, the car doesn't belong to you.

26:57.441 --> 26:59.274
We all have to share it and you
have it most of the time anyway.

26:59.276 --> 27:00.309
Well, what's so urgent?

27:00.344 --> 27:02.244
Are you gonna go see your
boyfriend in juvie?

27:02.246 --> 27:05.180
He's not my boyfriend and he's probably
not even my friend anymore

27:05.216 --> 27:06.265
and you're supposed
to be moving on, Brandon.

27:06.300 --> 27:08.050
- I am.
- Oh, yeah?

27:08.102 --> 27:10.102
Is that why you're doing Romeo and
Juliet as your senior project?

27:10.154 --> 27:12.825
- What does that mean?
- Can I please just have the keys?

27:31.208 --> 27:34.640
So everyone, this is Nick Stranos.

27:35.146 --> 27:37.946
He was doing donuts in
the school parking lot.

27:37.982 --> 27:39.982
Do you have anything you want to say?

27:40.017 --> 27:41.033
Yes.

27:41.068 --> 27:45.154
It's hard coming to a
new school junior year.

27:45.172 --> 27:50.392
I guess I was trying to make
a friend by showing off,

27:50.394 --> 27:53.979
but all I showed was what an idiot I am.

27:54.031 --> 27:55.397
Now, I like it here.

27:55.399 --> 28:01.036
It is the most
beautiful school I've ever seen

28:01.072 --> 28:06.024
and I am very, very
sorry for my actions.

28:08.362 --> 28:12.915
Well, I think since this
is your first offense,

28:14.351 --> 28:16.985
we can let you off with
a warning. Mariana?

28:19.023 --> 28:20.272
I agree.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.241
As long as he cleans up

28:22.276 --> 28:23.959
the tread marks that he left behind.

28:27.915 --> 28:30.332
Inside are soap and scrub brushes,

28:30.384 --> 28:32.351
and since you're gonna be
spending a lot of time on your knees,

28:32.386 --> 28:34.980
I've included these.

28:42.963 --> 28:44.246
Good job.

28:44.248 --> 28:47.266
Yeah. I can't believe we
framed the whole room in a day.

28:47.318 --> 28:48.350
It's pretty cool.

28:48.352 --> 28:51.186
Yeah. Well, you're a good worker, Nick.

28:51.222 --> 28:52.387
We'll see you tomorrow?

28:52.423 --> 28:55.174
- Yeah.
- All right, bud.

28:57.294 --> 28:59.094
Hey!

29:00.131 --> 29:02.181
I'm... I'm not Nick.

29:02.233 --> 29:04.099
Can...

29:04.135 --> 29:06.151
My name's not Nick.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.103
I'm Jesus...

29:10.107 --> 29:11.173
your son.

29:11.208 --> 29:14.143
And look, I'm sorry I
didn't tell you right away.

29:14.178 --> 29:16.245
I just wanted to get the
chance to know you...

29:16.280 --> 29:17.280
You gotta leave.

29:17.281 --> 29:19.114
Why?

29:19.150 --> 29:20.150
I can't be around you.

29:20.217 --> 29:21.216
Oh, no. You don't have to worry.

29:21.252 --> 29:23.085
It's not like I want anything from you.

29:23.120 --> 29:26.871
No, I can't legally be around you.

29:29.059 --> 29:30.139
Don't come back here again.

29:41.073 --> 29:42.073
Here he is.

29:45.945 --> 29:47.077
What happened to your arm?

29:47.113 --> 29:50.047
They took me to the
hospital. I told the doctors I fell.

29:50.082 --> 29:52.883
Well, did those boys do that to you?

29:52.885 --> 29:54.051
Did they break your arm?

29:54.053 --> 29:55.919
As long as I don't tell,

29:55.955 --> 29:58.856
they're gonna give
me my own room and food

29:58.908 --> 30:00.023
and video games. Anything I want.

30:00.076 --> 30:02.025
And they're gonna protect me now.

30:02.078 --> 30:04.061
- They won't protect you.
- Yes, they will.

30:04.096 --> 30:06.997
I finally have the
power for the first time

30:06.999 --> 30:07.998
since I've been in the system.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.883
I have the power.

30:10.970 --> 30:11.970
Thank you anyway.

30:12.004 --> 30:13.053
Hey, Jack!

30:13.105 --> 30:15.889
Hey, what about the
other kids in the home?

30:15.941 --> 30:18.061
If you protect the people that
let this happen to you,

30:18.077 --> 30:19.977
you're not gaining any power.

30:19.979 --> 30:22.880
You're giving it up for
every kid in Foster care.

30:25.918 --> 30:28.085
I'm really sorry I
pretended to be your friend.

30:28.120 --> 30:31.004
It's okay.

30:32.452 --> 30:34.341
If I let them take me out of this home,

30:34.393 --> 30:36.927
they're just gonna put me in another one

30:36.929 --> 30:39.930
where I won't have any
control, so I'm sorry.

30:44.987 --> 30:46.286
I don't get it.

30:46.322 --> 30:47.955
Some people don't want to be saved.

30:47.990 --> 30:50.290
Everyone wants to be saved.

30:50.342 --> 30:53.260
They just sometimes need permission.

31:07.877 --> 31:08.877
Hey.

31:08.911 --> 31:11.328
Thanks for the kneepads.

31:11.330 --> 31:14.298
Obviously you're off
the hook for those fries.

31:14.333 --> 31:15.565
Although, I know it wasn't

31:15.590 --> 31:16.934
- a serious offer.
- Who says?

31:16.969 --> 31:18.852
I'd still like to take you out sometime.

31:19.986 --> 31:21.305
I'll even let you borrow these.

31:21.357 --> 31:24.274
- Oh, you're disgusting!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

31:24.276 --> 31:26.326
Look, I don't know why I
do that around you, okay?

31:26.362 --> 31:28.245
You make me say stupid things.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.913
- Oh, so it's my fault?
- Yes!

31:29.915 --> 31:32.883
Yes, because you really
are so freaking hot.

31:36.922 --> 31:38.222
Fine.

31:38.257 --> 31:39.890
What?

31:39.942 --> 31:41.308
I'll go out with you.

31:41.360 --> 31:43.944
Uh, when?

31:43.979 --> 31:45.329
I don't know.

31:45.364 --> 31:46.364
Text me.

31:55.341 --> 31:56.341
Hey.

31:58.344 --> 32:00.260
What are you doing?

32:00.312 --> 32:02.846
Um, getting my affairs in order.

32:04.266 --> 32:05.349
It's not funny.

32:05.401 --> 32:08.285
Well, I really do think
that we need to update our wills,

32:08.320 --> 32:11.855
and I'd like to
talk to you about Brandon

32:11.891 --> 32:15.125
having access to his hand
money when he turns 18

32:15.127 --> 32:17.261
just in case anything
happens to the both of us.

32:19.348 --> 32:21.181
And there's one more thing

32:21.217 --> 32:22.332
that I would like to discuss with you.

32:22.368 --> 32:24.184
Your power of attorney.

32:27.239 --> 32:29.239
Sharon mentioned it because
she thought you came

32:29.291 --> 32:31.124
to my school yesterday to talk to me.

32:31.160 --> 32:34.077
Mama, I did come by actually,

32:34.129 --> 32:36.213
but you were... you were in your office

32:36.248 --> 32:37.314
alone with Monte with the door closed

32:37.349 --> 32:40.133
so I thought I would just would...

32:42.086 --> 32:43.303
When are we ever gonna get past this?

32:43.355 --> 32:45.138
I'm trying to, Lena.

32:45.190 --> 32:47.107
By giving Sharon your power of attorney?

32:47.142 --> 32:49.147
I did that because I
don't want you to have

32:49.172 --> 32:51.061
to make the decision to pull the plug...

32:51.096 --> 32:52.262
if... if it comes to that.

32:52.298 --> 32:54.131
Or maybe you're afraid I'll pull it

32:54.166 --> 32:56.083
because you're
convinced I'm in love with Monte.

32:56.135 --> 32:58.201
I don't... I don't
think you're in love with her.

33:00.172 --> 33:01.172
But...

33:03.008 --> 33:04.107
What if you...

33:06.028 --> 33:08.178
What if you fall in love with
her because I'm... I'm ugly?

33:08.213 --> 33:10.163
- 'Cause I'm...
- What are you talking about?

33:14.086 --> 33:17.120
Lena, you didn't want me to
get the mastectomy because...

33:17.172 --> 33:19.089
you were worried about our sex life

33:19.141 --> 33:22.009
and our intimacy and I might not like

33:22.061 --> 33:24.061
the way I look, that you might
not like the way I look.

33:24.096 --> 33:29.032
Honey, I said that when you
didn't need the surgery,

33:29.068 --> 33:32.202
when I was trying to talk you out of
doing something that wasn't necessary,

33:32.237 --> 33:36.123
when having it wasn't potentially
going to save your life.

33:36.158 --> 33:37.158
This is different.

33:37.176 --> 33:40.010
The result is the same.

33:40.045 --> 33:42.179
You know, I'm gonna have scars

33:42.214 --> 33:45.015
and I'm gonna have hard,
artificial breasts

33:45.067 --> 33:46.933
that I can't even feel.

33:46.986 --> 33:49.936
I won't have nipples unless
I get them tattooed on.

33:49.989 --> 33:51.071
I won't be beautiful like Monte.

33:51.106 --> 33:52.906
I'm... I just... I won't.

33:52.958 --> 33:54.124
And you know, I don't
care about the surgery.

33:54.159 --> 33:57.044
I'm not afraid of
this, that I don't... I'm...

33:57.096 --> 33:58.996
- I...
- You're not going to lose me.

34:01.016 --> 34:04.851
And what's beautiful about you
is so much more than your body.

34:06.055 --> 34:08.021
It's your heart and soul.

34:09.141 --> 34:10.940
Your mind.

34:13.978 --> 34:15.078
Your laugh.

34:15.114 --> 34:18.081
Your... your
courage and your compassion.

34:20.918 --> 34:23.954
Honey, I love this life that
we've built together.

34:25.056 --> 34:26.306
Our kids.

34:27.926 --> 34:29.926
Our family.

34:29.962 --> 34:30.976
You're my home.

34:32.965 --> 34:34.031
And I'm so sorry

34:34.065 --> 34:35.998
that I said anything that
ever made you feel

34:36.034 --> 34:37.868
like I wouldn't...

34:37.870 --> 34:40.971
wouldn't always find
you attractive and sexy

34:41.005 --> 34:43.340
and beautiful because I will.

34:43.375 --> 34:45.891
I mean, I always will.

34:48.947 --> 34:50.013
I...

34:50.065 --> 34:51.982
I'm scared.

34:56.989 --> 34:58.872
It's okay to be scared.

35:05.931 --> 35:08.298
What can I do for you?

35:08.333 --> 35:09.933
How can I help?

35:14.940 --> 35:16.873
You can...

35:19.912 --> 35:21.278
take me swimming?

35:32.975 --> 35:34.908
- You look like...
- I just walked here.

35:34.943 --> 35:36.193
Yeah, I did.

35:36.245 --> 35:37.327
My sister needed the car.

35:37.362 --> 35:40.230
But it gave me a chance to
think about what you said,

35:40.265 --> 35:43.200
and yes, I am getting over someone,

35:43.252 --> 35:45.335
and sometimes that's easier to do

35:45.370 --> 35:47.888
when someone else comes along, but
that doesn't mean that that person

35:47.923 --> 35:50.173
is the rebound person, okay?

35:50.225 --> 35:51.892
That person can also just be the one.

35:51.927 --> 35:54.144
You know, like when Romeo thought

35:54.196 --> 35:57.147
he was in love with Rosaline,
but he was until he met Juliet.

35:57.199 --> 35:59.149
And then they killed themselves.

35:59.201 --> 36:01.818
Well, yeah, but they
were still meant to be.

36:03.288 --> 36:05.122
So what if it's complicated?

36:15.184 --> 36:17.234
Do you have a... car seat?

36:20.339 --> 36:22.155
Yep.

36:22.207 --> 36:24.291
I don't suppose you're,
like, a nanny, right? Right?

36:24.326 --> 36:26.126
No, I'm a mother.

36:27.262 --> 36:28.302
I have a
two-year-old son.

36:31.216 --> 36:33.133
When I told you things were complicated,

36:33.185 --> 36:36.153
I didn't just mean your side of things.

36:41.360 --> 36:44.127
Well, uh...

36:44.163 --> 36:47.214
I think you should
probably take some time and...

36:47.249 --> 36:51.034
think about how much
complication you can really handle.

36:57.111 --> 36:59.935
Callie Adams Foster...
Okay. You're on the list.

37:18.923 --> 37:20.005
Thank you for seeing me.

37:22.060 --> 37:24.927
AJ won't see any of us.

37:24.929 --> 37:25.978
What do you want me to do?

37:26.013 --> 37:28.864
Give him permission

37:28.900 --> 37:31.033
to have a foster family that loves him

37:31.069 --> 37:33.986
and will take care of
him until you're out of here.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.042
Are you crazy?

37:40.094 --> 37:41.877
How long have you been working with him?

37:41.929 --> 37:43.212
Just a few days.

37:43.214 --> 37:45.848
Okay, but why would he say that
he couldn't be around me legally?

37:45.850 --> 37:49.018
I don't know. Maybe Ana took
out a restraining order against him.

37:49.020 --> 37:50.986
Can everyone
come downstairs please?

37:59.931 --> 38:01.831
Does anybody have any questions?

38:03.868 --> 38:05.835
How long are you
gonna be in the hospital?

38:05.870 --> 38:07.970
Just a few days.

38:07.972 --> 38:10.940
Are you... Will you be okay after?

38:10.975 --> 38:11.975
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

38:12.009 --> 38:13.809
Yeah, that's why I'm doing this.

38:13.811 --> 38:15.978
So that, um... make
sure I'm okay for a long time.

38:17.982 --> 38:19.815
- What can we do?
- How can we help?

38:20.918 --> 38:21.951
Um...

38:24.872 --> 38:26.789
well, you can...

38:26.824 --> 38:27.957
you can...

38:27.992 --> 38:29.792
make sure you do your chores and...

38:29.827 --> 38:32.745
and fold your own
laundry, and that would help a lot,

38:32.797 --> 38:33.879
and, um...

38:33.915 --> 38:36.832
I think...

38:36.834 --> 38:37.967
stay close.

38:38.002 --> 38:41.804
That would be great
because I think, um...

38:42.907 --> 38:43.923
you know, being together as a family,

38:43.975 --> 38:45.925
that's probably more
healing than any medicine.

38:50.848 --> 38:52.982
Hey, group hug, huh?

38:53.017 --> 38:54.767
Huh?

38:59.941 --> 39:01.957
All right, my babies.

39:01.993 --> 39:03.826
- Come on.
- What are we doing?

39:03.861 --> 39:05.861
- This is trespassing.
- They're out of town.

39:05.913 --> 39:07.830
What if somebody calls the cops?

39:07.865 --> 39:09.899
- You are a cop.
- Oh, my God, babe.

39:12.837 --> 39:13.869
What?

39:13.871 --> 39:15.805
You asked me to take you swimming.

39:15.840 --> 39:18.007
Okay, we don't have suits, Lena.

39:18.042 --> 39:19.758
Come on.

39:19.794 --> 39:21.760
Who needs suits?

39:25.016 --> 39:26.882
Oh, this is so on.

39:26.884 --> 39:27.933
- All right.
- Okay.

39:27.969 --> 39:30.936
Think you can outdo me?

39:30.972 --> 39:33.889
Last one in is on top tonight. Oh!
