07:23.544 --> 07:25.777
What time?

07:25.779 --> 07:28.747
Well, is someone going
to be there?

07:28.749 --> 07:31.216
I'm not gonna be on hold
for an hour?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.487
You want me
to take this?

07:39.526 --> 07:42.461
You can have a cookie.
We're gonna make you cookies.

07:42.463 --> 07:44.830
We're gonna bring
chocolate chip cookies
next time.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.232
Did you know your aunt Sarah
was a cheerleader?

07:48.534 --> 07:50.902
Is that good?

07:50.904 --> 07:52.604
It's true.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.508
I'm going to steal Sarah
for a second.

07:56.510 --> 07:59.077
Yeah, yeah. Girls,
let's go on and go, okay?

07:59.079 --> 08:00.745
Say goodbye to aunt Sarah.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.113
Upsy Daisy.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.815
No, we're gonna go
and have pizza.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.485
Come on.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.753
Wanna say goodbye?
Here, watch your step.

08:08.755 --> 08:09.988
What's bad for you?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.790
Pizza is bad for you.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.525
Why don't you
take this.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.160
She says pizza
is bad for you.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.695
You take the iPad.

08:18.598 --> 08:20.065
See you next week, okay?

08:24.270 --> 08:25.570
Bye!

08:30.643 --> 08:32.244

See you later,
kiddo, okay?

08:47.026 --> 08:49.094
Let's wait for dad.
Come on.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.142
Do you want a pill?

09:05.177 --> 09:06.545
Yeah.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.986
Do you want
something to eat?

09:14.988 --> 09:17.055
No, thanks.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.223
All right.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.227
I'll watch you eat.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.995
You don't want
to lay down?

09:23.997 --> 09:25.163
No.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.636
Let's get you up.
Wait a second.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.146
I'm going to move you
forward a little bit.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.815
Okay.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.852
Okay. I got you.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.121
There you are.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.238
Here.

13:09.488 --> 13:10.855
One more?

14:24.463 --> 14:27.198
I haven't called her yet.
I'll call her next.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.203
Yeah.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.877
Well, i-i don't know
if you guys are gonna...

14:38.879 --> 14:41.212
If you're gonna
find one or...

14:41.214 --> 14:42.981
What do you
want to do?

15:02.268 --> 15:03.968
Did you call
the agency?

15:03.970 --> 15:05.637
They told me
to wait for you.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.275
She's dirty.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.943
They told me not
to do anything.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.378
I'll call you
if I need you.

17:41.126 --> 17:43.194
I'm so sorry.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.395
Thank you.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.849
You want a ride?

18:04.851 --> 18:07.085
No, I'm just
at the gate there.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.619
I'm not far.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.354
I'm Karen,
Sarah's niece.

18:10.356 --> 18:11.556
I know.

18:11.558 --> 18:12.824
Come on, get in.

18:12.826 --> 18:14.425
No, I'm just here.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.793
Come on.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.108
I was surprised
to see you.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.510
Really, why?

18:32.512 --> 18:35.480
Do you always go
to your patient's funerals?

18:35.482 --> 18:37.115
Sometimes, yes.

18:39.184 --> 18:41.352
They told me
you got along.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.753
She really liked you.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.594
So what do you do now?

18:49.596 --> 18:51.562
Do you have
another patient?

18:51.564 --> 18:52.830
Not yet. No.

18:56.368 --> 18:58.736
This is me.
Just here.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.806
Do you wanna get
some breakfast or something?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.474
Just talk
a little bit more?

19:07.646 --> 19:09.514
I don't--
i-i should go.

19:09.516 --> 19:12.683
I just want to ask you a couple
of questions about my aunt.

19:14.386 --> 19:16.220
I'm sorry.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.782
I might need
another drink.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.750
All right.
What do you want?

20:22.287 --> 20:25.690
Should I be the husband?
The decision maker?

20:25.692 --> 20:27.658
Can I get, uh...

20:27.660 --> 20:29.594
Can I get
two shots of patron?

20:29.596 --> 20:31.295
- Are you alone?
- Mm-hmm.

20:31.297 --> 20:33.364
- Okay. Three shots!
- We'll get three. Thank you.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.399
We're celebrating.
We're getting married--

20:35.401 --> 20:37.868
well, we're getting--
we got engaged.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.504
- She asked me.
- Congratulations.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.673
What?! Sort of.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.476
I did. I asked.
Him to marry me.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.678
Are you married?
Do you have to deal with this?

20:47.680 --> 20:51.716
I was. My wife
passed away recently.

20:51.718 --> 20:52.950
I'm sorry.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.753
Mm-hmm.
She was very sick.

20:57.656 --> 20:59.390
I took care of her so...

20:59.392 --> 21:02.560
What-- what
was her name?

21:02.562 --> 21:04.362
Sarah.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.698
- Pretty.
- Yeah. To-- to Sarah.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.700
Yeah, to Sarah.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.435
- Sarah.
- Cheers.

21:17.843 --> 21:19.710
How long were you
married for?

21:19.712 --> 21:22.613
Twenty-one years.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.282
- Long time.
- Yeah.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.288
What'd she die of?

21:30.290 --> 21:31.889
Sorry to ask
a personal question.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.557
No. She had aids.

22:22.641 --> 22:23.808
<i> Hello?</i>

22:28.547 --> 22:29.714
<i> Hello?</i>

22:32.351 --> 22:33.784
<i> Hello?</i>

22:36.421 --> 22:38.389
<i> They're not answering.</i>

22:38.391 --> 22:40.124
<i> Hello?</i>

23:40.952 --> 23:42.987
How are you
feeling, John?

23:47.659 --> 23:49.026
This is David.

23:53.131 --> 23:55.032
Can you say hi
to David?

24:01.106 --> 24:03.007
Can you say
"hi, David?"

24:05.010 --> 24:06.677
Fuck you, Mildred.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.949
Who are you?

24:11.951 --> 24:13.818
I'm a nurse, John.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.456
- The stroke was five days ago.
- Okay.

24:18.458 --> 24:19.890
How does he
look to you?

24:19.892 --> 24:21.492
Let's take a look.

24:28.099 --> 24:30.701
Well, he seems strong.

24:30.703 --> 24:33.704
You have experience
in these types of cases?

24:33.706 --> 24:34.905
Yes, I do.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.140
Do they improve?

24:36.142 --> 24:39.043
Well, that depends
on John, really.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.078
The doctor is coming
in two hours.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.014
Okay, let's put this
on the bed, John.

24:44.016 --> 24:47.485
But with therapy
they improve a lot, right?

24:47.487 --> 24:50.521
Mildred,
will you shut up?

24:52.524 --> 24:54.024
You can start today?

24:54.026 --> 24:55.826
Yes, if John wants me to.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.495
Okay. Yeah.
Thank you.

25:00.131 --> 25:01.999
Do you mind
if I close this?

25:02.001 --> 25:03.234
No, go ahead.

25:07.272 --> 25:09.139
Need to see the bathroom?

25:09.141 --> 25:11.141
It's right there.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.644
All yours.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.112
I shit in bed.

25:21.887 --> 25:24.788
Okay, good. Let me get
your back now.

25:24.790 --> 25:27.291
I want you
to do the front, okay?

25:27.293 --> 25:30.561
Oh, there we are.

25:30.563 --> 25:31.962
Are you ready?

25:33.098 --> 25:34.265
Okay, now.

25:48.113 --> 25:49.179
Good, John.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.849
Very good.

25:53.952 --> 25:56.220
Get your privates
for you.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.289
Like that, okay.

26:03.128 --> 26:05.563
Hey, dad.
Linda, yes or no?

26:07.967 --> 26:09.800
Linda. Yes or no?

26:09.802 --> 26:11.869
No, no.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.170
Let me get that.

26:14.205 --> 26:16.807
That was very good.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.842
Very good indeed.

26:23.014 --> 26:24.181
Good.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.218
You want me to maybe
open a window?

26:29.688 --> 26:31.088
You want some air, John?

26:39.297 --> 26:41.699
All right, this one
you can help with, okay?

26:41.701 --> 26:43.000
Just give me a--

26:43.002 --> 26:46.370
just push back as much
as you feel comfortable.

26:46.372 --> 26:51.108
Shouldn't he be on oxygen
when you're doing this?

26:51.110 --> 26:53.077
Can you get out
of the room?

26:56.147 --> 26:57.314
Good.

26:59.217 --> 27:01.752
My head hurts.

27:01.754 --> 27:04.054
You want one
of my pills?

27:04.056 --> 27:06.056
I want you to leave.

27:09.395 --> 27:12.396
We'll be right outside
if you need anything.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.067
Okay.

27:21.172 --> 27:24.174
What really-- really--
really scares me...

27:26.077 --> 27:28.746
Having to depend
on them.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.347
They're scared too, John.

27:33.718 --> 27:35.185
You married?

27:35.187 --> 27:36.654
No.

27:36.656 --> 27:37.988
That's better.

27:39.724 --> 27:42.192
Women are unbearable.

27:44.095 --> 27:46.697
I'm just going to get
this pillow out from under.

27:46.699 --> 27:48.832
You're fine,
don't worry. I got you.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.200
I got your neck.

27:54.072 --> 27:55.973
You're an architect, right?

27:57.175 --> 27:58.375
Uh, yes.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.677
You can-- there.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.115
You married?

28:05.117 --> 28:09.987
No. I got-- I got
divorced 25 years ago.

28:14.993 --> 28:17.828
I'm going to turn you,
John, all right?

28:17.830 --> 28:20.731
So you tell me
if it hurts.

28:20.733 --> 28:21.932
Okay, honey.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.067
Okay.

28:25.036 --> 28:28.772
There. I'm going
to pull this across.

28:28.774 --> 28:30.708
So don't be surprised.
Need you to hold on.

28:30.710 --> 28:32.342
There we go.

28:36.347 --> 28:37.981
There we are.

28:40.085 --> 28:41.151
You good?

28:42.421 --> 28:46.023
Okay, let me steal this one.

28:50.495 --> 28:51.995
Right under there.

28:54.866 --> 28:57.234
Okay. Be right back.

28:59.804 --> 29:03.741
So, what kind of stuff
do you design?

29:04.776 --> 29:06.043
Hmm?

29:06.045 --> 29:11.281
Oh. I have some
small buildings...

29:11.283 --> 29:13.183
Downtown and...

29:15.019 --> 29:18.789
Some homes in...

29:18.791 --> 29:20.424
San Marino.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.326
Good.

29:22.328 --> 29:24.528
It's nothing
special,

29:24.530 --> 29:29.800
just f-f-functional stuff,
you know?

29:29.802 --> 29:31.168
It's like...

29:37.442 --> 29:41.345
Excuse me.
Do you have anything on suzin?

29:41.347 --> 29:44.114
I think we had something.
Let me check.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.282
Okay.

29:47.886 --> 29:50.087
Mm. We had
the taschen edition.

29:50.089 --> 29:52.556
It was his complete works,
but we sold out.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.424
Would you want me
to order it for you?

29:54.426 --> 29:55.793
No, thanks.

29:58.096 --> 29:59.496
What about suyida?

30:00.532 --> 30:02.432
I think so.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.034
Let me go check.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.202
Okay.

30:15.113 --> 30:16.313
Here you go.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.481
Thanks.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.117
Are you an architect?

30:20.119 --> 30:21.185
Yeah.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.986
My son is studying
architecture.

30:24.289 --> 30:25.455
Where?

30:25.457 --> 30:26.590
Berkeley.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.058
Nice.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.927
What kind of stuff
do you design?

30:29.929 --> 30:32.329
Functional, mostly.

30:32.331 --> 30:35.065
Some houses, couple
of small buildings.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.236
Well, let me know
if you need anything else.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.404
Okay.

30:48.279 --> 30:49.580
See, I like...

30:51.416 --> 30:53.317
The early ones

30:53.319 --> 30:54.985
because they're simpler.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.954
Isay weinfeld.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.121
Who?

31:00.158 --> 31:02.359
Isay weinfeld...

31:03.494 --> 31:05.929
Brazilian architect.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.398
Okay. You wanna
look him up?

31:16.374 --> 31:18.342
No. Let me do it.

31:19.377 --> 31:20.544
Okay.

31:35.159 --> 31:36.326
Really?

31:38.363 --> 31:39.596
Really, John?

31:47.338 --> 31:49.306
That... that's art.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.510
I'll get you some food.

31:53.512 --> 31:56.113
I want to see it.
Let me see it.

32:02.954 --> 32:04.421
Hello.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.924
Uh, my name's David.

32:06.926 --> 32:09.593
Uh, my brother...

32:09.595 --> 32:11.962
Uh, designed this place.

32:11.964 --> 32:15.132
And... John Sterling.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.366
Oh.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.568
And I was driving by
and I was wondering

32:18.570 --> 32:21.638
if it's possible
to take a look around.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.121
Come in.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.657
Nice to see you.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.459
Hi, Silvia.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.627
Hi.

33:52.063 --> 33:54.097
Be back in a minute.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.235
Did her tits
get bigger?

33:58.237 --> 34:00.470
No, you got
more desperate, John.

34:02.206 --> 34:05.042
He's on 200 mg
per hour.

34:05.044 --> 34:08.145
Check the pressure.
It shouldn't vary.

34:08.147 --> 34:10.246
And watch out
for the oxygen.

34:10.248 --> 34:11.681
See you in the morning.

34:11.683 --> 34:14.583
Okay.
Behave!

34:14.585 --> 34:17.521
- Call me if anything comes up.
- I will.

34:17.523 --> 34:20.290
Hey, how are you?
Is this comfortable?

34:20.292 --> 34:21.625
Huh?

34:47.284 --> 34:49.386
- Excuse me.
- Yep.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.688
- Can I get a fresh towel?
- Sure.

34:57.428 --> 35:00.097
Can I get it
in a plastic bag?

35:00.099 --> 35:04.234
The point of the plastic bag
is that your hands don't
touch it before mine.

35:05.736 --> 35:07.104
Thanks.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.280
Thank you, David.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.182
You didn't need
to bring anything.

35:19.184 --> 35:20.450
It's okay.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.852
Oh, ha!

35:25.289 --> 35:27.357
Happy birthday, John.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.198
Uh, iPad.

35:37.335 --> 35:38.502
Here.

35:45.576 --> 35:47.544
I'll just go back
to the kitchen.

35:47.546 --> 35:48.812
Okay.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.413
Thank you, David.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.590
Really?

36:00.592 --> 36:02.592
You thought I'd
bring you a hooker

36:02.594 --> 36:05.162
for your birthday,
did you?

36:05.164 --> 36:07.297
I'm dying.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.766
Well, then you don't need
a hooker, do you?

36:09.768 --> 36:11.601
You need a priest.

36:13.204 --> 36:15.772
I'm gonna
go get changed.

36:15.774 --> 36:18.308
You're not dying.
I'll bring you some food.

36:31.423 --> 36:32.923
Come in.

36:34.392 --> 36:36.893
Hi. I'm Lee.

36:36.895 --> 36:39.863
Silvia was sick, so I was sent
to cover her shift for tonight.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.566
Right. I'm gonna do
the night shift tonight.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.301
- It's okay.
- Why?

36:44.303 --> 36:48.471
Because he's delicate,
and he gets worse
at night.

36:48.473 --> 36:51.775
Robert doesn't need to know.
He'll still pay your shift.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.243
Are you sure?

36:53.245 --> 36:56.346
Yeah, it's okay.
You can go.

36:56.348 --> 36:57.581
All right, thank you.

36:57.583 --> 36:58.748
Okay.

37:15.968 --> 37:20.470
You... sent him away?

37:20.472 --> 37:21.905
Mm-hmm.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.307
Yeah, I wanted
to watch the movie.

37:30.848 --> 37:33.483
Was he handsome?

37:33.485 --> 37:34.951
Jesus Christ, John.

37:34.953 --> 37:37.821
I didn't get
a look at him.

37:39.423 --> 37:40.590
What?

37:43.894 --> 37:47.664
You never been
with a man?

38:00.611 --> 38:03.580
That's good.
That's good.

39:00.571 --> 39:02.539
Isn't it
the other nurse's shift?

39:02.541 --> 39:03.873
- Sorry?
- The other nurse.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.875
Isn't she
usually on right now?

39:05.877 --> 39:07.610
Yeah, I thought
I'd stay.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.947
Did she
not show up today?

39:10.949 --> 39:13.416
No, she did,
but I just thought
I'd stay.

39:13.418 --> 39:15.385
He was feeling
tired, so...

39:18.556 --> 39:20.757
- You must be really exhausted.
- I am.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.392
It's okay.

39:24.695 --> 39:27.364
Just, uh, let me know
if you need anything, okay?

39:27.366 --> 39:28.665
I'll be downstairs.

39:28.667 --> 39:29.833
Mm-hmm.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.995
Okay?

41:45.903 --> 41:47.070
Um...

41:48.873 --> 41:51.608
After dinner I'll come up
and sit with him, yeah?

41:51.610 --> 41:52.876
Okay.

42:19.103 --> 42:20.770
Wanna watch a movie?

42:22.106 --> 42:23.273
Hmm?

43:39.017 --> 43:40.917
Come in.

43:40.919 --> 43:43.353
- Hi.
- Hey, David. Sit down.

43:43.355 --> 43:44.921
What's going on?

43:44.923 --> 43:48.725
They want to sue you
for sexual harassment.

43:48.727 --> 43:49.892
Who does?

43:49.894 --> 43:51.694
John's family.
His children.

43:53.263 --> 43:56.799
Well, I was
just there.

43:56.801 --> 43:59.769
Why are you doing
multiple shifts
without permission?

44:03.240 --> 44:05.341
Well, John needed me.

44:08.245 --> 44:10.680
They found an iPad
with pornography.

44:10.682 --> 44:13.316
John's son said
John had an erection
while you were bathing him.

44:13.318 --> 44:15.184
- And so?
- He wants to sue you.

44:15.186 --> 44:18.254
He says you are
manipulating his dad.

44:18.256 --> 44:19.722
For what?

44:22.993 --> 44:25.728
If we tell them that you
won't go near John again,

44:25.730 --> 44:27.930
maybe they'll
withdraw the claim.

44:39.677 --> 44:40.777
Okay.

44:40.779 --> 44:42.445
I have to get
legal involved.

44:42.447 --> 44:44.147
Why don't you
just tell them?

44:44.149 --> 44:45.915
I don't want
another lawsuit.

44:45.917 --> 44:48.785
Don't go near John.
Don't go. Don't call.

44:48.787 --> 44:50.987
I've asked Silvia
to do a couple of shifts...

44:52.089 --> 44:53.890
Until I find someone.

44:55.993 --> 44:57.126
That's it.

45:52.950 --> 45:55.485
You can't be here.

45:55.487 --> 45:57.320
I never harmed him.

46:01.859 --> 46:04.393
If anybody else sees you here,
it's going to be worse for you.

46:04.395 --> 46:05.862
How is he?

46:05.864 --> 46:07.230
He's better.

46:07.232 --> 46:08.831
Does he know about this?

46:08.833 --> 46:10.433
No, of course not.

46:10.435 --> 46:13.169
Can I see him?

46:13.171 --> 46:15.304
David, we're
about to sue you.

50:13.276 --> 50:14.443
Hey.

50:20.417 --> 50:22.084
- Hi.
- Hi.

50:24.654 --> 50:26.022
How you doing?

50:29.659 --> 50:31.394
I'm fine.

50:31.396 --> 50:32.561
Okay.

50:34.398 --> 50:36.465
When did you get back?

50:36.467 --> 50:38.167
Two days ago.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.239
Are you staying?

50:43.241 --> 50:44.407
Yeah.

50:52.482 --> 50:54.683
- I'm studying medicine.
- I know.

51:00.690 --> 51:03.292
- It's good to see you.
- And you.

51:34.858 --> 51:37.326
Did you get
married again?

51:38.795 --> 51:40.429
No.

51:44.434 --> 51:45.801
You?

51:47.704 --> 51:50.473
I was married for four years,
then I divorced.

51:57.447 --> 51:59.115
What does Nadia know?

52:00.517 --> 52:02.151
- About Dan?
- Yeah.

52:03.520 --> 52:04.687
Everything.

52:38.655 --> 52:42.525
Okay.
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

52:44.929 --> 52:46.896
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

52:46.898 --> 52:48.564
Is Isaac in?

52:48.566 --> 52:50.366
Sure, and your name is?

52:50.368 --> 52:51.667
David Wilson.

52:51.669 --> 52:53.335
Okay, one second.

53:03.813 --> 53:05.347
Just be a second.

53:05.349 --> 53:06.515
Okay.

53:17.694 --> 53:19.795
Hi. Can I help you?

53:19.797 --> 53:21.964
I was hoping
to see your father.

53:21.966 --> 53:23.599
I used to work here.

53:23.601 --> 53:25.301
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

53:25.303 --> 53:27.269
He's almost never
here anymore.

53:27.271 --> 53:29.738
- Is he okay?
- He's-- he's fine.

53:29.740 --> 53:32.208
Can we write down daddy's
cell phone number for--?

53:32.210 --> 53:33.742
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

53:38.983 --> 53:42.218
The only thing I would need
is someone to drive me.

53:42.220 --> 53:45.921
The hospital insists on it.
I don't know why.

53:45.923 --> 53:47.790
Well, David
can drive you.

53:51.995 --> 53:54.863
Why would you work
for less money?

53:54.865 --> 53:58.367
I was let go
from another agency.

53:58.369 --> 54:00.703
I've known Isaac
for a long time.

54:06.276 --> 54:09.845
Take me to chemo.
I don't need any more for now.

54:12.015 --> 54:13.782
When's your appointment?

54:13.784 --> 54:16.585
I start again
on Tuesday at noon.

54:19.356 --> 54:20.856
I'll pick you up.

54:20.858 --> 54:22.925
Isaac, you'll give me
the information?

54:22.927 --> 54:24.493
Yes.

54:24.495 --> 54:26.395
I'll need
a phone number.

54:26.397 --> 54:27.630
Yes, of course.

54:38.541 --> 54:40.309
Were you married?

54:40.311 --> 54:41.477
Yes.

54:42.979 --> 54:45.547
Any children?

54:45.549 --> 54:48.584
Trisha and Ana.
They're 40 and 42.

54:51.454 --> 54:53.756
What do they do?

54:53.758 --> 54:55.591
Ana writes for magazines,

54:55.593 --> 54:57.893
and Trisha takes care
of her children.

55:03.500 --> 55:05.301
We don't have to talk.

55:18.481 --> 55:19.648
Ready?

55:24.087 --> 55:25.988
We'll be back
in an hour.

55:37.867 --> 55:40.536
She's on her second round
of chemo.

55:41.671 --> 55:43.839
She's very weak.

55:43.841 --> 55:45.841
Do you think
she'll get better?

55:47.677 --> 55:50.346
Mm-mm. I mean,
it's possible, but no.

55:53.917 --> 55:56.452
At first I didn't want
to study medicine.

55:56.454 --> 55:57.653
I mean,

55:57.655 --> 55:59.922
I did but I didn't.
You know?

55:59.924 --> 56:01.090
Mm-hmm.

56:09.532 --> 56:11.967
Have you decided
on your major?

56:11.969 --> 56:14.536
Not yet. I was
thinking plastics,

56:14.538 --> 56:16.905
but more reconstructive,
not aesthetic.

56:16.907 --> 56:18.073
Mm-hmm.

56:19.509 --> 56:21.577
Where do you wanna go?

56:21.579 --> 56:23.679
My mom wants me
to stay here, but...

56:23.681 --> 56:26.014
I really want
to apply to Boston.

56:26.016 --> 56:28.584
You should go
to Boston.

56:28.586 --> 56:29.785
I will.

56:29.787 --> 56:30.953
Mm-hmm.

56:32.555 --> 56:34.423
Do you think of him?

57:04.954 --> 57:06.121
Yeah.

57:12.529 --> 57:13.729
You?

57:14.864 --> 57:16.031
Yeah.

57:17.634 --> 57:19.435
I remember him.

57:21.971 --> 57:24.807
Do you think it would've
been different if we'd
found out before...?

57:24.809 --> 57:25.974
No...

57:34.117 --> 57:36.819
No way of
finding out, really.

57:40.890 --> 57:42.958
Do you think
i was wrong?

57:42.960 --> 57:44.827
No.

57:44.829 --> 57:47.196
Really?

57:47.198 --> 57:50.666
Not at all. I remember
he was always crying

57:50.668 --> 57:52.935
all the time
when he was at home.

57:54.771 --> 57:55.938
Yeah.

58:21.965 --> 58:24.132
It's difficult...

58:24.134 --> 58:26.835
When it gets into the bones,
it's difficult.

58:41.784 --> 58:44.052
Did you get on
with your mom's ex?

58:48.691 --> 58:49.992
More or less.

58:49.994 --> 58:51.159
Good.

58:52.762 --> 58:54.663
They didn't really
get along.

58:54.665 --> 58:55.831
Yeah.

59:00.970 --> 59:02.237
Tricky.

59:15.552 --> 59:17.886
Martha?

59:29.098 --> 59:30.265
Martha?

59:31.834 --> 59:34.770
Hi, Isaac. It's David.

59:34.772 --> 59:37.205
Have you heard
from Martha at all?

59:38.975 --> 59:41.243
- Well, I'm...

59:51.888 --> 59:56.258
Martha. Are you okay?

59:56.260 --> 59:59.595
I couldn't
get to the door.

59:59.597 --> 01:00:00.796
All right.

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:05.067
I was just tired.

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:06.234
Okay.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.740
Hi, Isaac. Yeah.

01:00:11.742 --> 01:00:13.141
No, I'm with her.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.881
I think she's going
to need somebody to stay.

01:00:19.883 --> 01:00:21.717
I mean, at night...

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:25.654
Just until she's
a little stronger.

01:00:25.656 --> 01:00:27.155
Yeah.

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:28.824
All right,
I'll call you back.

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:30.659
I'll call you back.

01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:32.327
I was...

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:35.263
Cooking and I got tired.

01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:36.798
Right.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.767
Can I get you
something?

01:00:38.769 --> 01:00:40.002
You want some water?

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:49.244
Are you hungry?

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:52.648
No.
I'm fine, thank you.

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:12.434
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.270
Just breathe.

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:24.980
It's okay.

01:01:37.795 --> 01:01:40.696
It's just the chemo.

01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:42.197
I know.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.001
It's not the first time
I've thrown up.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.375
Let's get you
cleaned up, okay?

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:54.743
All right?

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.280
Just breathe.

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:13.195
I'll be right there.

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:21.403
Here we go.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.911
All right.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.855
All right.

01:02:39.857 --> 01:02:42.390
Let's-- let's get you up.

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:46.795
Here you go. Okay?

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:52.801
All right.

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.440
Here.

01:02:58.442 --> 01:02:59.808
There we are.

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:11.019
Do you want to shower?

01:03:11.021 --> 01:03:12.487
I want to die.

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:26.868
I know you're being sued
for sexual harassment.

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:33.208
I'm sorry, but I had to
find out more about you.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:36.077
It's okay.
I should've told you.

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:40.882
Isaac explained it to me.
You don't have to worry.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.821
He told me
about your son.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.399
He was very sick,
Martha.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.371
My niece had
an abortion.

01:04:03.373 --> 01:04:07.108
They found out
the baby wasn't well.

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.211
She did
the right thing.

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:24.292
Let's get you
cleaned up, shall we?

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:29.931
There we are. Oh.

01:04:29.933 --> 01:04:31.199
Yeah.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.634
Mm?

01:04:32.636 --> 01:04:34.402
I can do it.

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:56.491
Did you sleep?

01:04:56.493 --> 01:04:58.627
Not a lot,
but well.

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:04.532
Would you like
some breakfast?

01:05:04.534 --> 01:05:06.635
Oh no, thanks,
i have to go.

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:16.244
Hi.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.412
Hi.

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:20.282
How are you doing?

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.551
I'm okay, thank you.

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:25.253
How are you?

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:26.621
I'm fine.

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:29.257
Working again.

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:30.425
Yeah, I know.

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:37.132
Do you want to come in?

01:05:37.134 --> 01:05:38.400
Sure.

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:02.490
I almost sold
the house twice.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:06.594
It was empty all the time
we lived with mark.

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:11.666
It was four years, right?

01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:13.034
Mm.

01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:17.405
Nadia wouldn't
let me sell it.

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:27.615
And your boyfriend,
is he here?

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:31.052
Yeah, um, yeah,
Chris is here.

01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:34.322
He's going back to visit
his parents for a little bit,

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.191
but he'll be back.

01:06:36.193 --> 01:06:37.492
Yeah.

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.527
Have you met them?

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:41.396
Yeah, actually.

01:06:41.398 --> 01:06:44.499
Um, I met them a few times.
They're really nice.

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:47.535
Are they? That's good.
That's important.

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:50.071
Yeah.

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:52.173
Especially if you get
married, you know.

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:56.244
The in-laws...

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:58.079
You never know.

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:03.018
I don't know
if I want to get married.

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:04.185
Really?

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:08.256
- Have you been married?
- Yes, yes.

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:12.060
Yes.

01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:14.562
I have two daughters

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:16.698
who are much older
than you are.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:20.668
And, um, uh,
three grandchildren.

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.670
That's great.

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:24.739
Boys or girls?

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:26.408
Two boys and one girl.

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:30.245
They are handful,
you know?

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:31.446
Sure.

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:36.484
They must love you.
This cooking is delicious.

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:39.220
Well, it's been
a long time

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.189
since I cooked for them.

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:12.320
See how it's white,
healthy tissue?
Normal tissue?

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:13.822
After your treatment

01:08:13.824 --> 01:08:16.758
and when we did
your last test...

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.194
See this dark area here?

01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:22.363
That means
there's metastasis.

01:08:22.365 --> 01:08:25.600
Rectal colon area.

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:29.636
It's not really what we'd
like to see after treatment.

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:34.309
So...

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.578
Does it make sense
to continue the chemo?

01:08:38.714 --> 01:08:40.215
Yes.

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:42.484
Even in complicated cases,

01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:45.653
we suggest
continuing the treatment.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:50.191
I would suggest
doing another round.

01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:53.194
If we don't,
this metastasis

01:08:53.196 --> 01:08:54.895
will spread
throughout your whole--

01:08:54.898 --> 01:08:57.765
but it's most likely
that it won't help

01:08:57.767 --> 01:08:59.834
because it's spreading
to other organs.

01:08:59.836 --> 01:09:02.703
There's no probabilities
with treatment,

01:09:02.706 --> 01:09:06.908
but I would suggest
doing another round.

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:09.544
I want you
to think about it...

01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:12.279
But it's really important
that if you're going

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:14.381
to do the treatment,
which I hope you will,

01:09:14.384 --> 01:09:16.216
that you do it soon.

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:30.564
Hello ?

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:34.335
Hi, how are you?

01:09:35.371 --> 01:09:36.703
I'm good.

01:09:38.175 --> 01:09:42.676
Yeah. I, uh, I just
got my results.

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:45.647
I'm clean. They didn't
find any more spots.

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:49.584
I know. Uh-huh.

01:09:49.586 --> 01:09:51.452
They're just
gonna follow up

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:54.288
with preventative chemo
once a year.

01:09:56.392 --> 01:09:58.726
Yeah.
No, they're sure.

01:09:59.929 --> 01:10:01.896
I know.

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:04.866
No, you don't
have to.

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:08.736
Yes, it is.
It's great news.

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:10.638
Yeah.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.608
No. Don't worry about it.
Whenever you can.

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:18.213
Okay. Bye.

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:23.218
My daughter.

01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:27.522
Before she
hung up she said,

01:10:27.524 --> 01:10:31.659
"so, you don't
need me to come over
at the end of the month."

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:59.420
If you can, pull over.

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:01.623
You want me to get
off the freeway?

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:03.258
Yes.

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:11.633
You feel like you're
gonna throw up?

01:11:11.635 --> 01:11:13.768
No.

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:16.437
Look for a bathroom.

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:48.062
There you go.

01:12:55.739 --> 01:12:57.672
Something, anything?

01:12:57.674 --> 01:12:58.906
Nothing.

01:12:58.908 --> 01:13:00.375
Are you sure?

01:13:00.377 --> 01:13:01.642
Not hungry.

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:06.681
What did
the doctor tell you?

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:10.985
- About what?
- About the treatment.

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:13.721
That you're
responding well.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.656
Are you comfortable?

01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:22.930
I'm not doing
it anymore.

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:28.736
You help me instead.

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:33.708
Well, if you don't want
to do the chemo,

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:36.010
I mean, that's up to you.

01:13:36.012 --> 01:13:38.780
That's not what
I'm talking about.

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:41.783
You care for me?

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:45.186
If you care for me,
then help me.

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:51.025
If you helped
your son, why not?

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:00.835
You need some rest.

01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:03.004
I don't want
to do it alone.

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:05.873
Hey.

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:28.463
It's all right.

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:40.475
I'm not going
to take chemo now.

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:55.216
I cancelled the session
for tomorrow.

01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:57.285
I know.

01:15:57.287 --> 01:15:59.053
They called.

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:15.202
Did you think
about it?

01:16:15.204 --> 01:16:16.571
Yeah.

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:21.275
I'm not doing it.

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:27.582
Then you should go.

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:29.917
I don't want you
to help me anymore.

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:33.888
I'll-- I'll call Isaac.

01:16:56.878 --> 01:16:58.879
Do you wanna help us?

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:01.082
Okay.

01:17:12.027 --> 01:17:13.661
Did you make
the salad?

01:17:13.663 --> 01:17:15.129
No. Go ahead.

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:15.489
It's David. Yeah.

01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:18.625
So, Martha died.

01:23:18.627 --> 01:23:21.295
Mm-hmm. Cardiac arrest.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:09.209
Um, I'll be gone
for about a week.

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:10.377
A week?

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.179
Yeah. We talked
about this.

01:24:12.181 --> 01:24:13.347
A week?

01:24:13.349 --> 01:24:14.748
Yeah, we talked
about this.

01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:17.418
So if it's possible
for you to come in

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:19.286
before I leave
so you can kind of

01:24:19.288 --> 01:24:22.189
get an idea
of how we work together.

01:24:22.191 --> 01:24:24.658
Um, you know,
just to get an idea...

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:27.461
It's not hard, but it's good
if you know ahead of time.

01:24:27.463 --> 01:24:29.630
I mean, of course,
I'll always be available

01:24:29.632 --> 01:24:31.498
for questions and so on,

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.200
but if you could
come in beforehand

01:24:33.202 --> 01:24:34.701
that would be great.
Is that possible?

01:24:34.703 --> 01:24:36.070
Yeah.

01:24:38.506 --> 01:24:40.240
How is it?

01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:44.611
He's sixteen.

01:24:44.613 --> 01:24:46.346
He's in a wheelchair.

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:50.417
His coordination's off.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:54.788
- How is he with you?
- Angry.

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:02.563
Does he need help
to eat, or...

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:05.799
Yeah.
Yeah, he does.

01:25:07.202 --> 01:25:09.503
But he can eat
anything?

01:25:09.505 --> 01:25:11.438
Pretty much, yeah.

01:25:58.686 --> 01:26:01.155
Can I get you anything?

01:26:05.593 --> 01:26:07.161
Fuck off.
