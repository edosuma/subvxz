<i>Hannah Montana,</i>
<i>you're on in two minutes. </i>

00:03.305 --> 00:06.433
All right, now shake the nerves out.
Yes, get them out, now.

00:06.508 --> 00:08.032
Now, loosen up the throat.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.074

00:21.790 --> 00:23.314
Good to go.

00:24.159 --> 00:25.717
Remember when I started
coaching you,

00:25.794 --> 00:30.356
when you were embarrassed
to do that? I miss those days.

00:30.866 --> 00:34.029
Hannah! Mwhah! Mwhah!

00:34.570 --> 00:36.902
I am so happy you guys are here,
are you having fun?

00:36.972 --> 00:37.996
Tons of.

00:38.073 --> 00:40.871
Except there's this weird girl
in your dressing room

00:40.943 --> 00:43.776
who keeps sticking her
tongue in the chocolate fountain.

00:43.846 --> 00:46.610
She looks like my dog in a rain puddle.

00:47.916 --> 00:51.545
- Hannah!
- You know her?

00:52.020 --> 00:55.421
- Traci and Evan, this is my friend...
- Lola Luftnagle.

00:55.591 --> 00:57.889
Daughter of oil baron Rudolf Luftnagle,

00:57.960 --> 01:01.691
sister of socialites Bunny
and Kiki Luftnagle, cousin of...

01:02.798 --> 01:05.391
But you can call me Lola. Strawberry?

01:06.501 --> 01:11.029
- Oops! My bad.
- Yes, it is.

01:11.106 --> 01:14.564
So, are you guys gonna
hang backstage?

01:14.643 --> 01:17.612
Oh, that'd be so cool.
We could hang together.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.945
But, then who would sit in our seats?

01:24.019 --> 01:28.353
Good point. And it is getting
a little crowded back here.

01:28.423 --> 01:31.654
I know what you mean. Who let
some of these people backstage?

01:31.727 --> 01:35.595
Tell me about it. Well, <i>hasta la pasta. </i>

01:37.366 --> 01:39.231
What a loser.

01:39.301 --> 01:40.290
They seem nice.

01:40.369 --> 01:45.033
- Maybe I should go with them.
- No, 'cause you're my good luck charm.

01:45.107 --> 01:47.337
My chocolate covered
good luck charm.

01:47.409 --> 01:48.671
That's embarrassing.

01:48.744 --> 01:52.441
Oh, no, no one noticed.
I'm gonna need another towel.

01:53.916 --> 01:59.115
Okay, so just stay right here where I
can see you, and no one else will.

02:00.856 --> 02:04.087
Just pretend those little feet are
nailed to the ground.

02:04.159 --> 02:06.684
<i>Hannah Montana to</i>
<i>the stage. It's show time. </i>

02:06.762 --> 02:07.922
Okay.

02:09.598 --> 02:13.557
Nailed right there. Okay.

02:20.842 --> 02:24.369
Don't worry, Hannah.
Lola will be right here for you.

02:24.446 --> 02:26.778
<i>The bathrooms are</i>
<i>over here, Ms. Stefani. </i>

02:26.848 --> 02:30.375
Gwen Stefani.
Gwen, wait up, babe, I'll go with you.

02:30.619 --> 02:32.211
Gweni, Gwendola.

02:33.855 --> 02:37.222
<i>Let's hear it, San Diego,</i>
<i>for Hannah Montana!</i>

02:42.798 --> 02:46.393
<i> So what you see</i>
<i>is only half the story</i>

02:46.468 --> 02:49.028
<i>There's another side of me</i>

02:49.838 --> 02:53.638
<i>I'm a girl you know</i>
<i>but I'm someone else, too</i>

02:54.142 --> 02:56.440
<i>If you only knew!</i>

02:56.645 --> 03:00.172
<i>It's a crazy life</i>

03:00.248 --> 03:03.308
<i>But I'm all right</i>

03:03.385 --> 03:07.617
<i>I got everything I've always wanted</i>

03:07.956 --> 03:09.890
<i>I'm living the dream</i>

03:09.958 --> 03:14.224
<i>So, yeah</i>
<i>everything I've always wanted</i>

03:14.396 --> 03:16.887
<i>Isn't always what it seems</i>

03:16.965 --> 03:20.128
<i>I'm a lucky girl</i>

03:20.402 --> 03:23.462
<i>Whose dreams came true</i>

03:23.638 --> 03:29.201
<i>But underneath it all, I'm just like you</i>

03:38.086 --> 03:39.383
<i> Come on!</i>

03:39.454 --> 03:41.786
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

03:43.692 --> 03:46.627
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

03:47.162 --> 03:50.256
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

03:51.099 --> 03:54.967
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

03:55.637 --> 03:58.834
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

03:59.274 --> 04:04.439
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

04:04.513 --> 04:08.813
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

04:08.884 --> 04:10.545
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

04:10.619 --> 04:12.314
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

04:12.387 --> 04:16.346
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

04:16.825 --> 04:18.519
<i>Mix it all together</i>

04:18.593 --> 04:21.494
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

04:36.611 --> 04:37.873
Wake up!

04:38.780 --> 04:42.773
Darlin', sometimes I wish
you came with a snooze alarm.

04:42.851 --> 04:47.117
- So what's this all about?
- Lilly. I don't know what to say to her.

04:47.422 --> 04:49.481
I mean, I don't want to hurt her feelings

04:49.558 --> 04:52.994
but, she was
so embarrassing backstage.

04:53.061 --> 04:54.358
Well, how bad was it?

04:54.429 --> 04:56.659
Let's just say Lilly made
a little unscheduled trip last night

04:56.731 --> 05:00.189
to Dork Flats, Iowa. Population, her.

05:01.703 --> 05:04.228
Come on, Mile,
Lilly's just not used to being backstage.

05:04.306 --> 05:05.364
I'm sure next time, she'll...

05:05.440 --> 05:08.568
Won't follow Gwen Stefani all the way
into the bathroom

05:08.643 --> 05:11.771
and ask her to sign
her protective seat cover?

05:13.148 --> 05:14.809
It ain't funny.

05:15.317 --> 05:16.579
Dad, you don't know what it's like

05:16.651 --> 05:20.087
to have someone you love
embarrass you all the time.

05:23.792 --> 05:25.316
I think I do.

05:28.196 --> 05:32.690
Hello? Lilly landing in three...
Two... One.

05:33.635 --> 05:36.160
That concert last night was
so much fun. I had so much fun.

05:36.238 --> 05:38.763
- Did you have so much fun?
- I had fun!

05:38.840 --> 05:42.537
Did you see that dreamy boy
in the third row? Woo!

05:43.778 --> 05:47.578
We don't sound like that,
and he was in the second row.

05:51.119 --> 05:54.247
Come on, people,
I make pancakes with that milk!

05:55.590 --> 05:57.785
The Hannah line.
It's always somebody so cool!

05:57.859 --> 06:01.659
- Let me get it, please!
- No, no, no, I'll get it. Yo-la!

06:01.730 --> 06:04.631
- Hey, superstar.
- Hey Trace, what's going on?

06:04.699 --> 06:08.226
We're throwing a little birthday bash
for Kelly tonight.

06:09.471 --> 06:11.405
Kelly? Kelly Clarkson?

06:11.473 --> 06:14.874
I can't believe I'm actually going
to Kelly's party.

06:16.011 --> 06:17.603
<i>Trace, hold on a sec. </i>

06:17.679 --> 06:19.704
I'm not sure if I can
bring anybody, Lilly.

06:19.781 --> 06:24.343
- Well, ask her.
- Ask her. Right. I should ask her.

06:25.754 --> 06:26.880
Now.

06:30.192 --> 06:32.592
So, Trace, I can't bring anybody, right?

06:33.795 --> 06:37.561
Sure, Kelly said you can bring
anybody you want.

06:38.733 --> 06:41.668
Trace, it's Lola. I'll see you there!

06:42.837 --> 06:47.331
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I'm actually
going to a big Hollywood party.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.810
Excuse me.

06:51.179 --> 06:54.876
<i>Hannah,</i>
<i>I have a micro-problem. </i>

06:56.685 --> 06:58.209
I know, but Lilly,

06:58.286 --> 07:03.918
Lola is really great once you
get to know her. Right, okay, bye.

07:07.996 --> 07:12.433
- Lilly's not invited, is she?
- What do I do now, Dad?

07:13.235 --> 07:14.429
Look!

07:16.738 --> 07:18.968
And that's before the party.

07:20.275 --> 07:22.869
I just wish there was some type of
magic spell

07:22.944 --> 07:26.710
which could stop people from
acting like total geeksicles!

07:33.321 --> 07:36.017
Me, too, honey. Me, too.

07:39.628 --> 07:41.721
Babe alert, 11 o'clock.

07:43.098 --> 07:45.658
Older woman checking me out.

07:45.734 --> 07:47.201
In your dreams, Oken.

07:47.269 --> 07:49.066
Normally, yes, but...

07:49.137 --> 07:53.403
But she's only looking at you,
because you're sitting next to me.

07:53.508 --> 07:57.808
Watch and learn, boys. But don't
applaud, it throws off my timing.

08:01.149 --> 08:03.982
Please pretend to like me,
those guys are watching.

08:04.052 --> 08:05.679
Oh, I don't have to pretend.

08:05.754 --> 08:07.449
- You're cute.
- Really?

08:07.522 --> 08:11.185
Yes, you are.
You're just the cutest little boy.

08:11.259 --> 08:15.286
Look at that face.
And those chubby, chubby cheeks!

08:17.465 --> 08:21.231
- Not helping!
- I'm sorry, let me make it all better.

08:21.736 --> 08:23.533
- Do you want some candy?
- No, I don't want any candy...

08:23.605 --> 08:25.800
What kind is it?

08:29.644 --> 08:32.807
Yuck it up, boys,
I got nougat on the first date.

08:35.116 --> 08:36.845
Now it's time for a real man.

08:36.918 --> 08:40.615
- It's Rico time.
- Yeah, it's Rico's bedtime.

08:41.890 --> 08:44.450
Prepare to cry yourself to sleep.

08:46.161 --> 08:49.995
Hi, please pretend to like me,
my boss's kid is watching.

08:50.899 --> 08:53.424
- But I do like you.
- Oh...

08:55.003 --> 08:56.470
- I'm Nina.
- Jackson.

08:56.538 --> 08:57.835
Look, I don't mean to be pushy...

08:57.906 --> 09:00.670
No, please, push. I like pushy.
Pushy's good.

09:00.742 --> 09:02.642
I'm a student at
the Malibu School of Beauty

09:02.711 --> 09:04.702
and I was just wondering if
I could borrow your head.

09:04.779 --> 09:06.940
- What?
- Well, it's just that your hair

09:07.015 --> 09:09.575
is so fantastic and I really need
someone to practice on

09:09.651 --> 09:11.915
and I'd just give anything
to get my hands on it.

09:11.986 --> 09:15.752
Well, today's your lucky day.
Anything is exactly my price.

09:17.092 --> 09:18.821
Here, have a seat.

09:19.761 --> 09:22.696
- How do I do it?
- You got me.

09:23.031 --> 09:24.555
Or, I got you.

09:35.877 --> 09:39.506
Wow. That's... That's interesting.

09:39.581 --> 09:41.549
I'm so sorry.

09:41.616 --> 09:45.313
My parents were right. I don't have
what it takes to be a beautician.

09:45.387 --> 09:49.949
No, no, of course you do. Don't worry.
We'll fix this. We'll fix this, right?

09:50.024 --> 09:53.892
Yeah, let me just go home and practice
on my dog one more time.

09:53.962 --> 09:55.953
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:00.135 --> 10:03.536
<i>Party, party, party!</i>
<i>Party, party, party!</i>

10:03.605 --> 10:08.872
Everybody, now! Party, party...
Hey, what's wrong?

10:08.943 --> 10:13.073
- Lilly, we have to talk.
- Well, let's talk on the way to the party.

10:13.648 --> 10:16.742
- No, Lilly, we have to talk now.
- Why, what's the matter?

10:17.051 --> 10:18.040
Okay.

10:19.554 --> 10:23.354
You know how we promised to always
be honest with each other?

10:23.658 --> 10:26.183
- Yeah.
- No matter how hard it may be.

10:26.728 --> 10:30.289
You trying to tell me that this shirt
does not go with this hair?

10:30.532 --> 10:35.026
Okay, I'm just gonna come right out
and say this because

10:35.303 --> 10:38.295
you're my friend, Lilly,
and I owe you that much.

10:38.373 --> 10:39.738
Truth is...

10:41.075 --> 10:43.100
The party's been canceled.

10:50.752 --> 10:56.349
Hannah, I've been looking all over for
you. What are you doing out here?

10:57.759 --> 10:59.954
I'm waiting for my dad
to come pick me up.

11:00.028 --> 11:02.360
But Kelly's not even here yet.

11:02.430 --> 11:05.456
I know.
I guess I'm not really in the party mood.

11:05.533 --> 11:11.529
Okay, love you,
but you're downing my vibe. TTYL.

11:13.541 --> 11:15.600
- Hello?
- So, what you doing?

11:15.677 --> 11:19.613
Lilly. I'm not doing anything. Nothing.

11:19.681 --> 11:23.981
Just... Just studying.
I mean, no party. Just me. Party of one.

11:25.854 --> 11:28.652
- What's that?
- Oh, that's just Jackson

11:28.723 --> 11:32.056
playing his stereo too loud.
Jackson, turn it down!

11:32.126 --> 11:34.185
I'm studying, fool!

11:34.262 --> 11:37.527
- So, want to go to the mall tomorrow?
- Sure, the mall sounds like fun.

11:37.599 --> 11:40.090
Hannah Montana! Say, "Cheese!"

11:40.168 --> 11:43.194
- Who's that?
- Just my dad ordering pizza.

11:43.271 --> 11:46.707
No, Dad, I don't want extra cheese!
Sorry, I gotta hang up

11:46.774 --> 11:51.143
before he goes all deep dish on me.

11:51.212 --> 11:54.238
Hi. I was just wondering if you could be
the good guy

11:54.349 --> 11:58.342
- and not print out that picture.
- Sure, sweetheart, no problem.

11:58.486 --> 12:01.182
Oh, wait a minute, I'm not a good guy.

12:03.157 --> 12:06.251
Well, in that case, I'm not a good girl.

12:06.327 --> 12:09.524
- Give me the camera!
- Get off me! What are you doing?

12:09.597 --> 12:11.394
Hannah's not happy!

12:24.145 --> 12:28.309
She was just trying to even out
the sides and get rid of the orange.

12:28.483 --> 12:30.007
I'm not gonna say a thing.

12:30.084 --> 12:32.484
- Well, thank you.
- I'm gonna sing a thing.

12:32.554 --> 12:34.852
<i>I once knew a girl</i>
<i>named Nina</i>

12:34.923 --> 12:36.914
<i>And, boy, she was a find</i>

12:36.991 --> 12:42.293
<i>So I gave my sweetie my golden locks</i>
<i>Now I look like a bluebird's behind</i>

12:42.363 --> 12:47.767
<i>A bluebird's behind</i>
<i>A bluebird's behind</i>

12:47.835 --> 12:48.824
Dad!

12:52.273 --> 12:55.800
Whatever happened to using your own
misery to write a song?

12:55.877 --> 12:59.779
I'm sorry, Son. I only make fun
because I've been there myself.

12:59.881 --> 13:02.441
Heck, every guy has.
But look on the bright side.

13:02.517 --> 13:04.917
At least you got yourself a date
with a pretty girl.

13:04.986 --> 13:06.954
Well, not yet.

13:08.056 --> 13:09.387
Well, then you better hurry up before

13:09.457 --> 13:12.221
somebody uses your head
as a toilet brush.

13:12.594 --> 13:13.891
Ouch!

13:15.863 --> 13:19.890
Okay. That's all the papers
between Lilly's house and here.

13:19.968 --> 13:23.802
Holy Moly! How desperate are you?

13:25.106 --> 13:30.408
Well, look who's talking! At least I'm
not the one taking "Hannah's wild ride. "

13:32.180 --> 13:35.843
Listen, Shmohawk, I don't care
what I have to do.

13:35.917 --> 13:38.977
If Lilly finds out why I didn't take her
to the party, it'll crush her.

13:39.053 --> 13:40.350
I'm not gonna let that happen.

13:40.421 --> 13:42.912
Well, darlin', then you better
make those newspapers disappear.

13:42.991 --> 13:44.982
Lilly in ten.

13:56.104 --> 13:57.731
- Ready?
- For what?

13:57.805 --> 14:01.764
The mall. I gotta pick out
a slammin' outfit for the next party.

14:01.843 --> 14:04.471
I mean, I wouldn't wanna
embarrass you.

14:05.380 --> 14:08.543
No, we wouldn't want that.
So, let's go to the mall.

14:08.616 --> 14:11.483
Yeah, the good old mall with that big
newsstand and all those people

14:11.552 --> 14:13.076
talking about what's in the news
and who's in the news.

14:13.154 --> 14:16.055
On the other hand,
the beach sounds like fun, too.

14:16.124 --> 14:18.752
- But the mall has cute clothes.
- But the beach has cute boys.

14:18.826 --> 14:20.589
To the beach! Go!

14:24.465 --> 14:25.727
Guys, there you are!

14:25.800 --> 14:28.291
You'll never guess who made the cover
of the entertainment section.

14:28.369 --> 14:29.666
Who?

14:30.338 --> 14:32.738
Hey, Oliver, go long!

14:33.808 --> 14:36.606
Too long!

14:38.212 --> 14:39.873
You know what? I'm hungry, let's eat.

14:39.947 --> 14:43.439
Hungry, hungry, hungry,
hungry, hungry.

14:49.023 --> 14:51.856
You know what?
There is one hot grandpa.

14:58.499 --> 15:01.662
There was a bee. A big bee.

15:03.104 --> 15:06.267
I think I got it. You're welcome.

15:09.310 --> 15:11.471
Seriously, I want you guys to see this!

15:11.546 --> 15:13.571
Hey, dude with the board!

15:16.751 --> 15:18.275
Never mind!

15:18.352 --> 15:20.115
You know what?
It's getting really crowded back here.

15:20.188 --> 15:22.315
Let's go look for sea glass.

15:26.794 --> 15:29.058
Okay, cross your fingers.

15:35.737 --> 15:37.466
I think I fixed it.

15:38.306 --> 15:41.241
Why do I feel a breeze on my head?

15:41.309 --> 15:43.607
Why do I feel my head?

15:47.515 --> 15:50.814
Well, at least I know you're done.

15:50.885 --> 15:53.820
Oh, I messed up again!

15:53.888 --> 15:57.187
No, no, no, it's okay.

15:57.258 --> 16:00.284
When it grows back out,
you can try again.

16:00.361 --> 16:03.660
- You'd really let me try again?
- Well, sure.

16:03.731 --> 16:05.665
I can't take this anymore.

16:05.733 --> 16:09.464
You're bald!
Why aren't you mad at me?

16:09.537 --> 16:12.097
It's not like you did it on purpose.

16:12.673 --> 16:16.939
- But, I did.
- Why? Why would anybody...

16:17.678 --> 16:22.206
Oh, no. Something smells like Rico.

16:23.451 --> 16:25.009
The kid paid me.

16:25.086 --> 16:28.886
I never would have done it
if I'd known you were so nice.

16:28.956 --> 16:31.618
I just wish I could help you
get him back.

16:31.692 --> 16:35.992
Well, I'm sorry. I'm just too upset
to think about revenge right now.

16:36.063 --> 16:37.724
Okay, I'm over it.

16:41.569 --> 16:45.596
Tell me again what Jackson looked like
when he realized it was me.

16:47.275 --> 16:50.369
Don't forget the scream.
That's my favorite part.

16:53.548 --> 16:56.415
Life just doesn't get
any better than this.

16:56.717 --> 16:59.845
Okay, make me look Friday-night fresh.

16:59.921 --> 17:04.050
You got it. Just close your eyes,
sit back and relax.

17:08.362 --> 17:10.762
Ah, not too much off the sides now.

17:10.832 --> 17:12.424
Mmm-hmm.

17:18.906 --> 17:21.238
Wow, I've got enough sea glass
to make a coffee table.

17:21.309 --> 17:23.607
- What about you?
- I've got enough sea glass to never,

17:23.678 --> 17:28.638
ever look for it again.
Oh, are the comics in here?

17:28.716 --> 17:32.152
We didn't get our paper today.
Nobody on our block did.

17:32.220 --> 17:34.245
Who cares about the comics?

17:34.322 --> 17:36.415
I mean the fat lazy cats and
the pumpkin-headed kid

17:36.490 --> 17:39.926
who's always trying to kick that football.
Boring!

17:40.995 --> 17:43.896
- Let's just talk, we never talk.
- We talked all day.

17:43.965 --> 17:45.830
You know what? Good point.
I'm tired of my own voice.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.765
Let's listen to someone else's.

17:47.835 --> 17:49.735
<i>Next on</i>
This Week In Hollywood,

17:49.804 --> 17:53.171
<i>what pouty pop princess pummeled</i>
<i>a paparazzi last... </i>

17:53.241 --> 17:54.572
But I wanted to see that!

17:54.642 --> 17:56.200
No, you don't.

17:57.645 --> 17:59.545
Why is your couch so lumpy?

17:59.614 --> 18:03.380
Oh, speaking of lumpy.
Let's make some oatmeal.

18:03.451 --> 18:06.181
Nothing like a big bowl of oatmeal
after a long day at the beach.

18:07.355 --> 18:09.016
- Oh, the Hannah phone!
- No!

18:09.090 --> 18:12.651
Hello, Hannah Montana's
close personal friend Lola here.

18:12.727 --> 18:15.719
Oh my gosh, Kelly!

18:15.796 --> 18:18.890
It's Kelly Clarkson! Hello.

18:18.966 --> 18:20.456
Lilly, give me the phone.

18:20.534 --> 18:23.196
So, Kelly Felly, sorry to hear
the party was canceled.

18:23.271 --> 18:25.330
Lilly, give me the phone!

18:25.573 --> 18:29.805
- What do you mean? Hannah said...
- Lilly, don't listen to her!

18:30.378 --> 18:33.211
She doesn't like me!
Professional jealousy!

18:33.581 --> 18:35.640
Petty, petty girl!

18:36.918 --> 18:40.684
Okay, I'll tell her you called. Bye.

18:41.856 --> 18:43.824
Lilly, I can explain.

18:44.125 --> 18:46.593
The only reason I didn't tell you about
the party is because...

18:46.661 --> 18:48.652
You didn't want me there?

18:48.729 --> 18:50.492
It wasn't me that didn't want you there,
it was...

18:50.564 --> 18:52.156
Traci and Evan?

18:52.833 --> 18:55.825
Yeah, they kind of thought
you were uncool.

18:55.903 --> 18:58.701
Even after you told them
how cool I was?

18:59.740 --> 19:02.231
You didn't tell them that, did you?

19:02.677 --> 19:04.144
Not exactly.

19:04.845 --> 19:06.437
No, Lilly, wait.

19:07.548 --> 19:10.108
You don't need them as your friend.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.377
You got me.

19:11.452 --> 19:15.149
But if you were really my friend,
you'd tell me the truth.

19:15.356 --> 19:18.189
Okay, I'll come right out and say it.

19:21.495 --> 19:25.761
You spit food on people,
you followed them into the bathroom,

19:26.801 --> 19:32.000
and you walked around for
about an hour with a chocolate beard.

19:32.073 --> 19:36.407
Oh, how embarrassing.
Why am I such a dork?

19:36.477 --> 19:40.470
Why do I always do that?
Lilly, when are you ever gonna learn?

19:41.782 --> 19:44.012
No, Lilly, don't be so hard on yourself.

19:44.085 --> 19:46.178
I mean the first time I saw
the chocolate fountain,

19:46.253 --> 19:49.120
I poured about half of it into my purse.

19:49.190 --> 19:51.988
You're saying that
to make me feel better.

19:52.727 --> 19:55.491
What the heck are
all these newspapers?

19:55.563 --> 19:57.394
I'll tell you what they are.

19:57.465 --> 19:59.956
They're me not being a good friend.

20:00.634 --> 20:04.434
I got caught leaving the party early
and I didn't want you to know.

20:04.505 --> 20:06.496
Why were you leaving early?

20:06.574 --> 20:08.769
Because it was no fun
without you there.

20:08.843 --> 20:12.279
- Really?
- Yeah. And you know what?

20:13.781 --> 20:15.681
It's never gonna happen again.

20:21.255 --> 20:23.553
We don't have to do this.
We're still best friends.

20:23.624 --> 20:26.320
I know, that's exactly why
I have to do this.

20:26.427 --> 20:29.828
Hannah, it's so awesome to see you
with... her.

20:30.931 --> 20:35.493
- What was it again? Lola Loser-nagle?
- It's Luftnagle!

20:35.569 --> 20:38.470
- It is Luftnagle, right?
- I think.

20:38.539 --> 20:41.667
Well, whatever it is,
she's not on the list.

20:41.742 --> 20:45.143
You know what? I like you Trace,
but if you wanna be my friend

20:45.212 --> 20:46.304
she's part of the deal.

20:46.380 --> 20:49.144
But she's just so uncool.

20:49.216 --> 20:51.912
Not as uncool as you were
when you shot a snot rocket

20:51.986 --> 20:55.649
so big it hit both of the Olsen twins.

20:55.723 --> 20:59.022
That's not fair.
You know I have sinus problems.

20:59.493 --> 21:03.224
Well, we all have problems.
But a good friend doesn't bail on you

21:03.297 --> 21:04.594
when you have 'em.

21:04.665 --> 21:07.600
I didn't bail on you with the twins
and I'm not gonna bail on Lilly.

21:07.668 --> 21:09.226
- Lola.
- Right.

21:10.004 --> 21:14.338
Okay fine, but tell anyone about the
snot rocket and you're out.

21:14.408 --> 21:16.933
- Deal.
- Meet you in there.

21:21.582 --> 21:25.109
Well, what you did for your friend
was real nice.

21:26.654 --> 21:28.281
I think so, too.

21:29.824 --> 21:31.689
Is that Orlando Bloom?

21:32.827 --> 21:33.987
I'm cool. I'm cool.

21:34.628 --> 21:35.959
- Just go for it.
- Thanks!

21:39.133 --> 21:41.363
- She is kind of a dork.
- I know.

21:41.469 --> 21:44.597
But she's my dork. Orlando!

21:50.111 --> 21:54.207
That's real smart. Laugh at the person
who's handling your food!

21:56.250 --> 21:59.344
- You tell 'em, cue ball.
- Thanks, Mini-Me.

22:01.422 --> 22:05.916
Hey, we may look alike
but we will never be the same.

22:10.698 --> 22:12.461
You know,
I think what we learned here is that

22:12.533 --> 22:16.663
there are no winners in a war like this.
Only hairless casualties.

22:17.004 --> 22:20.167
You're right.
Maybe we should call a truce. Deal?

22:20.508 --> 22:21.975
Deal.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.710
- You're good.
- You're good.
