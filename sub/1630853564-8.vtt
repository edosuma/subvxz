00:00.560 --> 00:03.800
The following programme
contains strong language.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.440
They had a hostage.
It was Janet.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.920
Who's this?
Zhang Rui.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.560
Could we meet? Tomorrow maybe? OK.

00:25.160 --> 00:26.840
That's some good speakers you got.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.440
It sounded like a gun went off.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.360
I've met someone.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.080
We're getting married.

00:41.840 --> 00:44.480
George Addo, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.720
Now, you don't have
to say anything unless...

01:12.040 --> 01:15.680
So, er, the thing is we've been
working together for a while now.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.000
And, er, I respect you as...

01:20.000 --> 01:20.280
And, er, I respect you as...

01:20.320 --> 01:22.920
a colleague and as a professional.
Right.

01:22.960 --> 01:26.480
But recently... well, not that
recently, but never mind.

01:27.800 --> 01:28.000
I've begun to think-
Dennis...

01:28.000 --> 01:30.720
I've begun to think-
Dennis...

01:30.760 --> 01:33.040
Are you trying to ask me out?

01:33.080 --> 01:36.000
Well... yes, I am.

01:36.000 --> 01:36.840
Well... yes, I am.

01:47.560 --> 01:48.680
Well, go on then.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.640
This is it.
This is me asking you out.

01:51.680 --> 01:52.000
This is it?
This is it right now?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.400
This is it?
This is it right now?

01:54.440 --> 01:56.720
Right now, yeah.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.920
Oh, fuck off, Jesus Christ.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.000
The thing is, I think about
you all the bloody time.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.480
The thing is, I think about
you all the bloody time.

02:01.520 --> 02:05.320
And it's starting to do my head in.
So, there you go.

02:07.520 --> 02:08.000
Well...

02:08.000 --> 02:09.320
Well...

02:12.200 --> 02:15.120
I think about you all the time, too.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.640
Yeah?

02:22.640 --> 02:24.000
It-It does my head in an' all.

02:24.000 --> 02:24.600
It-It does my head in an' all.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.760
So, what do you reckon?

02:43.440 --> 02:45.400
Yeah, I'll go out with you.
Yeah?

02:45.440 --> 02:47.920
Yes, why not?

02:47.960 --> 02:48.000
Why... not?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.960
Why... not?

02:51.320 --> 02:53.400
Who's texting you?

02:53.440 --> 02:55.120
Dunno.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.000
Who cares?

02:56.000 --> 02:56.760
Who cares?

03:28.280 --> 03:29.880
Are you comfortable?

03:30.840 --> 03:31.880
Good.

03:39.040 --> 03:42.400
Uncuff yourself. If you try anything
I will shoot you.

03:43.760 --> 03:44.000
Move!

03:44.000 --> 03:45.160
Move!

04:21.680 --> 04:23.560
What the fuck was that?!

04:48.760 --> 04:50.440
Hey man, I'm so sorry, er...

04:50.480 --> 04:53.320
I just got these new speakers
and a gun went off on the TV,

04:53.360 --> 04:54.840
nearly gave me a heart attack.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.000
I didn't wake you up, did I?
Nah, you're alright, man.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.480
I didn't wake you up, did I?
Nah, you're alright, man.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.400
I wanted to make sure you were OK.
No, no, no, I'm all good.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.840
I'll makes sure I keep it down.
Hey, no worries. OK.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.000
Bye- Bye, bye, bye, bye.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.200
Bye- Bye, bye, bye, bye.

05:09.160 --> 05:10.160
Hello?

05:10.200 --> 05:12.000
George, you need to come
in straight away.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.920
George, you need to come
in straight away.

05:13.760 --> 05:14.960
Yeah.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.440
What the hell happened?
The world ended.

05:26.480 --> 05:28.000
Who nuked us?
No one. It wasn't a bomb.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.160
Who nuked us?
No one. It wasn't a bomb.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.960
It was an emission of
gravitational radiation

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
caused by two black holes
merging together.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.200
There was a big fucking
explosion in space

05:39.240 --> 05:41.840
and everything in the known
universe got zapped.

05:41.880 --> 05:44.000
Sorry, what?
There's the singularity.

05:44.000 --> 05:44.680
Sorry, what?
There's the singularity.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.920
Now there's another one.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.000
What, someone made a copy?

05:52.000 --> 05:52.800
What, someone made a copy?

05:52.840 --> 05:54.920
You don't just make a copy
of a black hole.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.360
It's im- It's impossible.
Yet it's just happened.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.520
But there wasn't a warning.
How did we go back?

05:59.560 --> 06:00.000
We have a dead man's
switch on our end.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.120
We have a dead man's
switch on our end.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.040
If it's destroyed
it resets automatically.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.360
Alright, so how do we stop it
exploding again?

06:07.400 --> 06:08.000
It's already started
collapsing in on itself.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.760
It's already started
collapsing in on itself.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.800
In three weeks' time it'll go
again. We can't stop it.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.000
So we're just going to keep living
the next three weeks on loop?

06:16.000 --> 06:16.240
So we're just going to keep living
the next three weeks on loop?

06:18.080 --> 06:19.480
Ma'am?!

06:28.160 --> 06:31.000
So what do we do?
I don't know, George.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.000
I can stop a nuclear missile
being launched,

06:32.000 --> 06:33.160
I can stop a nuclear missile
being launched,

06:33.200 --> 06:35.040
I can't stop
a black hole collapsing.

06:35.080 --> 06:38.480
There must be something.
The singularities don't just
appear overnight.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.000
No. They don't.
So someone's behind this.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.040
No. They don't.
So someone's behind this.

06:44.480 --> 06:48.000
If you wanted to work out a way
of creating your own machine,

06:48.000 --> 06:49.600
If you wanted to work out a way
of creating your own machine,

06:49.640 --> 06:52.800
of turning back time yourself,

06:52.840 --> 06:55.240
what would you do?

06:55.280 --> 06:56.000
I don't know.

06:56.000 --> 06:56.640
I don't know.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.200
If it were me?

06:58.240 --> 07:02.280
I'd find the one person smart enough
to know how all this works.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.000
I'd go and get them
and I'd put them to work.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.560
I'd go and get them
and I'd put them to work.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.800
Janet?

07:17.360 --> 07:19.520
Where's Archie, Wes?
Shanghai.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.000
We think the Chinese are involved.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.480
We think the Chinese are involved.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.960
I've met someone.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.520
We're getting married.

07:29.560 --> 07:32.720
I wanted to say I'm
sorry for how we ended.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.440
This is Archie. Leave a message.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.080
Yo, Archie, it's me.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.000
Just call me back.

07:44.000 --> 07:44.480
Just call me back.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.000
She's your sister.
If that jogs your memory.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
She's your sister.
If that jogs your memory.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.280
I don't know where she is.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.400
It's the singularity.
It's self-destructing.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.000
I don't think we can stop it.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
I don't think we can stop it.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.000
Oh hey, man. I'm-I'm
so sorry, I just got, erm...

11:12.000 --> 11:14.440
Oh hey, man. I'm-I'm
so sorry, I just got, erm...

11:14.480 --> 11:18.720
I got these new speakers
and a gun went off on the TV
and nearly gave me a heart attack.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.000
Alright, no worries.
OK, bye. Bye mate! Bye.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.960
Alright, no worries.
OK, bye. Bye mate! Bye.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.000
This is Archie. Leave a message.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.160
This is Archie. Leave a message.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.240
For fuck's sake, Archie.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.720
Call me back.

12:07.920 --> 12:08.000
George?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.800
George?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.840
Sa-Sarah?!

12:14.080 --> 12:16.000
I waited for you for an
hour in the cafe today.

12:16.000 --> 12:16.560
I waited for you for an
hour in the cafe today.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.320
Shit, sorry.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.680
It's OK, it's...

12:26.240 --> 12:28.520
Sa-Sarah, it's...

12:28.560 --> 12:29.960
That isn't...

12:30.000 --> 12:31.400
Damn it!

12:34.320 --> 12:35.720
For God's sake!

12:46.560 --> 12:48.000
Sarah. Sarah. Get in the car.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.040
Sarah. Sarah. Get in the car.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.960
George, what the fuck?

12:51.960 --> 12:53.920
Just get in the car, Sarah.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.040
His name's Shiv.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.000
He's an ex-operative

13:04.000 --> 13:05.080
He's an ex-operative

13:05.120 --> 13:08.360
for a top secret organization
called The Lazarus Project

13:08.400 --> 13:10.640
who are tasked with preventing

13:10.680 --> 13:12.000
and undoing Extinction-level events.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.160
and undoing Extinction-level events.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.360
Why is he dead in the
boot of your car?

13:15.400 --> 13:18.000
Because I'm a Lazarus agent.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.000
You're an app developer.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.560
You're an app developer.

13:21.560 --> 13:24.920
No. No, not for a long time.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.760
I don't understand, you're...

13:27.800 --> 13:28.000
like, you're a spy?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.920
like, you're a spy?

13:30.800 --> 13:33.640
No. Er, no, I'm-I'm an operative.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.280
You killed someone.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.640
I've killed a lot of people.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.480
Bad people.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.000
I just... I don't...

13:44.000 --> 13:45.280
I just... I don't...

13:48.560 --> 13:51.200
I want to show you something.

13:59.760 --> 14:00.000
Is this real?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.360
Is this real?

14:32.840 --> 14:34.440
Oi...

14:35.920 --> 14:37.640
You know you can't tell anyone.

14:37.680 --> 14:40.000
I can't tell anyone
there's a secret Bond lair

14:40.000 --> 14:40.040
I can't tell anyone
there's a secret Bond lair

14:40.080 --> 14:43.280
just off Tottenham Court Road
and my ex-boyfriend's a spy?

14:43.320 --> 14:46.120
I hate it when you call me your ex.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.560
Same.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.000
What were you gonna tell me
in the cafe yesterday?

14:56.000 --> 14:56.920
What were you gonna tell me
in the cafe yesterday?

14:56.960 --> 14:58.560
Nothing.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.000
Well, I'm only gonna be here
for another three weeks.

15:04.000 --> 15:04.960
Well, I'm only gonna be here
for another three weeks.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.480
After that I've got to go somewhere.
So...

15:43.920 --> 15:44.000
She's staying in Sunset villas.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.600
She's staying in Sunset villas.

15:46.640 --> 15:50.120
Apartment Building, room num-
Room number twenty-one, yeah.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.000
What are the chances I turn up and
have security agents waiting for me?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.600
What are the chances I turn up and
have security agents waiting for me?

15:53.640 --> 15:54.960
Please, I...

15:55.000 --> 15:57.200
Your parents.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.560
Your son.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.000
If you lie to me...

16:00.000 --> 16:01.400
If you lie to me...

16:20.720 --> 16:22.680
Zhang Rui?

16:22.720 --> 16:23.880
Get up.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.520
You're not going anywhere.

17:03.800 --> 17:04.000
Jesus!

17:04.000 --> 17:05.400
Jesus!

17:11.160 --> 17:12.000
I wish you could tell me
where you were going tomorrow.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.480
I wish you could tell me
where you were going tomorrow.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.520
Yeah, I wish I could too.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.040
I really missed you.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.840
I missed you.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.000
Whenever you get back from...

17:44.000 --> 17:44.320
Whenever you get back from...

17:44.360 --> 17:46.320
wherever it is you're going...

17:47.240 --> 17:49.560
will you come and find me?

17:49.600 --> 17:52.000
I will always come and find you.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.000
Nah, you're alright.

18:32.000 --> 18:32.120
Nah, you're alright.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.040
I just wanted to
make sure you were OK.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.560
Hi.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.000
Nice to see you again.

18:40.000 --> 18:40.520
Nice to see you again.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.800
Next time just knock.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.640
You can remember time loops?

18:44.680 --> 18:46.880
Did you think
you were the only ones?

18:49.400 --> 18:52.000
I'm looking for Janet.
Janet. Yeah, I know.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.000
Who gave you the serum?

18:56.000 --> 18:56.680
Who gave you the serum?

18:56.720 --> 18:58.080
We made our own.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.920
Yeah? What else did you make?

18:59.960 --> 19:02.320
We wanted what you have
so we made a machine.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.000
Where's Janet?
I passed her to my handler.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.120
Where's Janet?
I passed her to my handler.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.560
I don't know where they were
taking her after that.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.440
OK.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.000
Where's your handler?
We were supposed to meet,

19:12.000 --> 19:12.760
Where's your handler?
We were supposed to meet,

19:12.800 --> 19:15.480
day before the checkpoint,
but he never showed.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.200
Now he doesn't answer his phone.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.000
Maybe your friend got to him first.
My friend?

19:20.000 --> 19:20.680
Maybe your friend got to him first.
My friend?

19:20.720 --> 19:23.720
Brown skinned guy.
British accent. Curly hair.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.360
Killed my team in Germany.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.120
I hope we meet again one day.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.280
No, I don't think you do.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.240
How did you find Janet
in the first place?

19:35.280 --> 19:36.000
Lazarus. We've been tracking
all of you for years.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.680
Lazarus. We've been tracking
all of you for years.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.360
Your new recruit led us
straight to her.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.960
George? He went to
her apartment in Barcelona

19:44.000 --> 19:45.680
just before the nuke went off.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.520
We couldn't believe our luck.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.160
This is gonna keep
happening, isn't it?

19:58.120 --> 19:59.920
I don't know.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.000
George? I waited for you
for an hour in the cafe today.

20:08.000 --> 20:08.880
George? I waited for you
for an hour in the cafe today.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.520
Hey...

20:13.480 --> 20:15.080
Wait.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.000
Wait, Sar-

20:16.000 --> 20:16.360
Wait, Sar-

20:34.680 --> 20:37.480
Oh shit. Oh shit.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.000
Fuck sake, Sarah.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.040
Just look both ways for once.

21:02.840 --> 21:04.000
Christ, Christ, Christ.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.040
Christ, Christ, Christ.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.920
You fucking idiot.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.640
Fucking idiot! Fucking id-

21:46.040 --> 21:49.640
Just tell me something, Shiv.
Just try and tell me something.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.000
I don't know what to do.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.120
I don't know what to do.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.560
I just wanted you
to hear it from me.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.840
We're happy.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.840
I know this is painful.

22:05.880 --> 22:07.520
We're engaged!

22:14.680 --> 22:16.000
I'm sorry about the noise, mate,
I was just playing a video game.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.840
I'm sorry about the noise, mate,
I was just playing a video game.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.040
Just watching a movie.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.000
It's just a movie, Reggie!

22:24.000 --> 22:24.320
It's just a movie, Reggie!

22:33.960 --> 22:35.280
Man on a bike.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.000
Woman with a buggy.

22:40.000 --> 22:40.960
Woman with a buggy.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.680
Hat man.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.840
I wanted you to hear it from me.

22:55.680 --> 22:56.000
We're happy.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.520
We're happy.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.040
You're alright, man.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.000
What are we going to do, ma'am?

23:20.000 --> 23:20.240
What are we going to do, ma'am?

23:21.440 --> 23:23.560
Going to start
waking people up.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.160
Who?

23:27.400 --> 23:28.000
World leaders.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.080
World leaders.

23:29.120 --> 23:30.840
Governments.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.520
People in charge.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.000
We can't fix this on our own.
Maybe we can't fix it at all but...

23:36.000 --> 23:37.240
We can't fix this on our own.
Maybe we can't fix it at all but...

23:38.440 --> 23:40.320
..it's time to start
looking for help.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.480
Boy, did I underestimate you

24:03.280 --> 24:04.280
Shiv?

24:15.800 --> 24:16.000
I'm about to wake up in China.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.360
I'm about to wake up in China.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.680
Archie, I-
I don't want to hear it, George.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.000
I know why you did it.

24:24.000 --> 24:24.440
I know why you did it.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.000
And you know
why that doesn't matter.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.640
Is Shiv 'dead' dead,

24:28.680 --> 24:29.960
or will the loop bring him back?

24:30.760 --> 24:32.000
It brings him back with
a bullet in him.

24:32.000 --> 24:32.560
It brings him back with
a bullet in him.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.520
I've been trying to save him.
I haven't.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.280
Well, you better work out a way.

24:40.080 --> 24:43.360
Right now we live in a world
without consequences.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.840
But you're gonna help me
bring them back.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.720
And then you're gonna face them.

24:47.760 --> 24:48.000
Understand?

24:48.000 --> 24:49.160
Understand?

24:52.240 --> 24:53.480
Good.

25:02.280 --> 25:03.560
I trusted you.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.280
You betrayed me.

25:06.320 --> 25:07.920
I had to save her-
No.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.240
You wanted to save her.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.000
It's the same thing, Archie.

25:12.000 --> 25:12.280
It's the same thing, Archie.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.720
You pretend like
you don't know that,

25:16.800 --> 25:18.160
but you do.

25:23.560 --> 25:24.800
Janet?

25:28.680 --> 25:31.040
I don't know.
I don't know where she is.

25:31.080 --> 25:32.760
But there's a rival machine
out there

25:32.800 --> 25:34.840
and she's the key to fixing this.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.000
I think Shiv knows something.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.280
I think Shiv knows something.

25:36.320 --> 25:38.520
Better find out a way to
save him, hadn't you?

25:43.160 --> 25:44.000
Next loop,

25:44.000 --> 25:44.760
Next loop,

25:44.800 --> 25:46.160
while he's still alive,

25:47.240 --> 25:49.440
tell him I'm sorry
I didn't believe him.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.000
Tell him I'm gonna make it right.

25:52.000 --> 25:52.960
Tell him I'm gonna make it right.

26:38.840 --> 26:39.880
Collapsed lung.

26:39.920 --> 26:40.000
Almost certainly.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Almost certainly.

26:42.040 --> 26:44.680
So, how, how would you treat
this if you were there?

26:44.720 --> 26:47.560
Well, I'd release the trapped air
and get some fluids into him.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.840
Yeah, OK..

26:49.880 --> 26:51.240
..but like, which fluids?

26:52.080 --> 26:54.480
Which department did you say
you were from again?

26:55.600 --> 26:56.000
Murder squad.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Murder squad.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.280
Look,

27:02.320 --> 27:04.000
there was probably nothing
you could have done.

27:04.000 --> 27:04.800
there was probably nothing
you could have done.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.600
I wouldn't beat yourself up
about it.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.520
You didn't show up today.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.560
Yeah, shit. I'm sorry.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.560
It's alright, I don't blame you.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.800
I figured it wasn't
gonna be a good talk.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.000
George, I-

27:38.040 --> 27:39.800
You're seeing someone, I know.

27:40.720 --> 27:41.880
It's fine.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.520
You're gonna marry him, but,

27:46.560 --> 27:48.800
you're already having doubts
and figured if you told me,

27:48.840 --> 27:50.360
it would mean you couldn't turn back.

27:51.480 --> 27:52.000
Or...

27:52.000 --> 27:52.960
Or...

27:53.000 --> 27:54.040
..am I wrong?

27:56.360 --> 27:57.400
Yeah.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.360
George, are you OK?

28:08.880 --> 28:10.600
I'm just really fucking alone.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.640
What's the fucking point?

28:38.200 --> 28:39.720
Where're you going?

28:39.760 --> 28:40.000
Anywhere else.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.640
Anywhere else.

28:41.680 --> 28:42.960
See you in the next loop.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.200
I'm sorry, I can't...

29:02.880 --> 29:04.000
Just mind your own business, Reggie!

29:04.000 --> 29:04.440
Just mind your own business, Reggie!

29:04.480 --> 29:06.680
Just mind your own fucking business!

29:25.560 --> 29:28.000
Hey, I didn't mean to
disturb you last night.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.160
Hey, I didn't mean to
disturb you last night.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.560
You know, I heard the noise,
I was just a bit worried.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

29:32.040 --> 29:34.400
Er, I'm sorry, I was- I was just-

29:37.920 --> 29:39.560
Are you fucking kidding me?

29:39.600 --> 29:40.680
Excuse me?

29:45.800 --> 29:47.320
What do you think?

29:47.360 --> 29:48.880
Looks like blood.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.360
Yeah.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.880
I wouldn't hold your breath.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.000
No, that's OK. This was kind of
a last resort anyway.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
No, that's OK. This was kind of
a last resort anyway.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.920
Ah, yes, here...

30:22.400 --> 30:23.920
..I can read the words.

30:23.960 --> 30:24.000
"It'll... worth... wait.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.800
"It'll... worth... wait.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.320
"It'll worth wait."

30:28.360 --> 30:30.680
It'll, it'll be worth the wait?

30:30.720 --> 30:31.880
Gaps match.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.640
Mean anything to you?

30:36.080 --> 30:37.160
No.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.760
Oh, there is something else.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.160
Here at the bottom.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.000
What are they?

30:48.000 --> 30:49.200
What are they?

30:49.240 --> 30:51.560
Symbols of some kind.

30:51.600 --> 30:55.680
Japanese kanji
or Chinese characters maybe?

30:55.720 --> 30:56.000
I don't know.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.160
I don't know.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.560
George?

32:23.520 --> 32:24.000
Why didn't you come
to the cafe earlier?

32:24.000 --> 32:25.280
Why didn't you come
to the cafe earlier?

32:25.320 --> 32:27.400
Yeah, I'm, I'm sorry. Can I come in?

32:28.520 --> 32:29.760
I just want to talk.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.560
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.400
I mapped out everyone
that walked past my apartment

32:59.440 --> 33:00.520
on that first morning.

33:01.360 --> 33:02.920
I followed most of them home.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.280
There's this one guy.

33:06.200 --> 33:09.520
He got a bus out of town
to a small park and hanged himself.

33:10.760 --> 33:12.000
Now I see him every time we go back,

33:12.000 --> 33:12.720
Now I see him every time we go back,

33:12.760 --> 33:14.320
off to hang himself.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.160
I said hello to him once
and you know what?

33:17.400 --> 33:19.440
He didn't do it.

33:19.480 --> 33:20.000
He went home instead.

33:20.000 --> 33:20.920
He went home instead.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.200
It's crazy.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.560
The smallest things
can make the biggest difference.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.400
Can you hear that?

33:31.480 --> 33:33.400
A couple of loops back
I went next door

33:33.440 --> 33:35.760
and threw the guy playing
the guitar out the window.

33:38.040 --> 33:39.600
I'm thinking about doing it again.

33:39.640 --> 33:41.680
What's so special about Janet?

33:41.720 --> 33:43.840
Genius level IQ.

33:43.880 --> 33:44.000
Brain the size of a small country.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.720
Brain the size of a small country.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.520
Your government made
their own serum.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.760
Then they tried to
make their own machine.

33:51.800 --> 33:52.000
And it's gone wrong.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.080
And it's gone wrong.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.400
And I think they've taken her
to try and fix it.

34:02.760 --> 34:04.720
I found out where
they're keeping her.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.000
And you're gonna need help.

34:08.000 --> 34:08.320
And you're gonna need help.

34:12.200 --> 34:13.760
Know anyone good?

34:15.200 --> 34:16.000
Let me get this straight,

34:16.000 --> 34:16.600
Let me get this straight,

34:16.640 --> 34:18.160
they have a time machine...

34:20.400 --> 34:22.920
..that can undo time,

34:22.960 --> 34:24.000
and no one knows about it...
Yeah, it's true, Sarah.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.240
and no one knows about it...
Yeah, it's true, Sarah.

34:27.040 --> 34:30.160
And now there's a problem
we can't fix.

34:32.240 --> 34:35.560
We just keep living these three weeks
again and again and again and...

34:36.760 --> 34:38.920
..it's just like it was
right at the start of this

34:38.960 --> 34:40.000
and I don't know what to do.

34:40.000 --> 34:40.280
and I don't know what to do.

34:42.360 --> 34:45.160
I don't know if not knowing what's
going on is better than knowing.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.000
I don't know if...

34:48.000 --> 34:48.640
I don't know if...

34:48.680 --> 34:52.560
..it's selfish and cruel
to even give you this option,

34:52.600 --> 34:55.720
if being woken up is worse
than sleeping through it.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.000
All I know is that I miss you, Sarah.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.640
All I know is that I miss you, Sarah.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.160
I miss you so much.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.800
And I know you miss me too.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.880
And I told you that
I would always come and find you.

35:14.200 --> 35:15.840
This is me trying to do that.

35:18.440 --> 35:19.520
Are you taking heroin

35:19.560 --> 35:20.000
No, I'm not ta-

35:20.000 --> 35:21.040
No, I'm not ta-

35:24.400 --> 35:26.040
it's a serum, Sarah.

35:27.720 --> 35:28.000
It will help you remember
the time you've lost -

35:28.000 --> 35:29.760
It will help you remember
the time you've lost -

35:29.800 --> 35:31.480
And what did I lose, George?

35:31.520 --> 35:32.720
Everything.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.000
We were married.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.320
We were gonna have a baby.

35:41.760 --> 35:42.920
Everything.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.240
But we can get that back.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.320
I love you, Sarah.

35:52.040 --> 35:54.040
I always have.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.400
Every time.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.560
Alright, pal?

36:19.800 --> 36:21.000
Rebrov...

36:21.040 --> 36:23.320
I don't need this, do I?

36:25.360 --> 36:28.080
Probably not, the world's gonna
explode in half an hour anyway.

36:32.760 --> 36:35.280
What do you want?
Where's Janet?

36:35.320 --> 36:36.600
Fuck me if know.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.240
I went to Barcelona.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.480
No sign of her.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.000
Yeah, she got taken.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.200
Yeah, she got taken.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.360
Think it was the Chinese
but she could be anywhere now-

36:43.400 --> 36:45.640
You've got people looking for her?
Archie.

36:45.680 --> 36:47.400
And Shiv?

36:47.440 --> 36:48.000
Hmm.

36:48.000 --> 36:48.440
Hmm.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.240
No, we fucked Shiv, remember?
Aye.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.280
Well, he still might be
looking for her though.

36:57.200 --> 36:58.280
Beer?

36:59.440 --> 37:00.640
Go on then.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.800
It's the singularity, isn't it?

37:09.840 --> 37:10.960
Something happened.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Yeah, it's fucked.

37:12.000 --> 37:12.320
Yeah, it's fucked.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.840
Is that your scientific opinion?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.680
Am I wrong?
No, pretty much on the money.

37:21.200 --> 37:23.640
This does not feel like a flat

37:23.680 --> 37:25.680
that has a woman living in it.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
This is very much a bachelor pad
if I'm not mistaken.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.800
This is very much a bachelor pad
if I'm not mistaken.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.040
So,

37:31.080 --> 37:33.320
where's the resurrected girlfriend?

37:33.360 --> 37:34.920
She dumped me.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.000
Oh? Sad.

37:36.000 --> 37:36.760
Oh? Sad.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.360
Fuck off.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.480
Sorry.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.000
Hmm, Shiv.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.280
Hmm, Shiv.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.640
Interesting.

37:46.680 --> 37:48.280
He came here to tell me something.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.400
But I shot him, before he could.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.040
Well, that was a silly thing to do.

37:54.080 --> 37:55.880
Yeah, well obviously
I didn't mean to-

38:00.920 --> 38:02.480
Anyway, he has a note with him.

38:02.520 --> 38:03.920
Anything helpful?

38:07.680 --> 38:08.000
It says "time machine" in Mandarin.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.840
It says "time machine" in Mandarin.

38:10.880 --> 38:12.880
And above it,
the full sentence must be-

38:12.920 --> 38:14.640
It'll be worth the wait.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.080
What?

38:19.120 --> 38:20.160
This is-

38:26.840 --> 38:28.920
Right...

38:32.240 --> 38:34.440
He's been shot, I need help! Come on!

38:40.920 --> 38:42.800
Come on! Come on! Come on!

38:42.840 --> 38:44.040
Call 999.

38:44.080 --> 38:46.000
Mate, are you alright?
Can you hear me?

38:46.880 --> 38:48.000
Oh Jesus.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.120
Call 999!
No, no.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.640
You need to stabilise him here.

39:43.680 --> 39:44.000
Look, George,
there's only so much I can do.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.440
Look, George,
there's only so much I can do.

39:45.480 --> 39:46.840
Then do it.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.080
Jesus.

39:49.440 --> 39:52.000
OK. I asked the landlord
what the neighbours were like.

39:52.000 --> 39:52.680
OK. I asked the landlord
what the neighbours were like.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.160
I fucking asked him.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.000
Shiv, I need you to speak to me.
Where's Janet?

40:16.000 --> 40:16.560
Shiv, I need you to speak to me.
Where's Janet?

40:17.920 --> 40:19.240
Shiv?!

40:19.280 --> 40:21.640
Come on, man, you need to
give me something! He needs space!

40:59.240 --> 41:00.960
He's trying to speak!

41:01.000 --> 41:02.960
Get the fuck out the way!

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Shiv! Shiv, talk to me.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.720
Shiv! Shiv, talk to me.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.200
I got you, man. I got you.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.000
You shot me. You fucking dickhead.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.240
You shot me. You fucking dickhead.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.080
Yeah, yeah, man.
I'm sorry about that.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.720
Ja-Janet -

41:16.760 --> 41:19.000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know,
we have to go and save her.

41:19.040 --> 41:20.000
No.

41:20.000 --> 41:20.160
No.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.400
You don't understand...

41:21.440 --> 41:23.840
What? Under, understand what, Shiv?

41:23.880 --> 41:25.520
Rebrov's the key...

41:38.800 --> 41:40.800
Big plans are afoot.

41:40.840 --> 41:43.360
Remember that?
One of our little codes.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.000
It was Janet's idea, actually.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.280
It was Janet's idea, actually.

41:45.320 --> 41:46.320
We had all sorts.

41:46.360 --> 41:49.840
Kill, run, hide.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.080
Simple meanings.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.880
But there was one that was more
important than the others.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.080
The phrase that meant,

41:58.120 --> 41:59.680
"I'm in trouble.

41:59.720 --> 42:00.000
I need you.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.080
I need you.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.320
Come and get me."

42:06.160 --> 42:08.000
"It'll be worth the wait."

42:08.000 --> 42:08.400
"It'll be worth the wait."

42:08.440 --> 42:09.720
She came up with that one.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.240
Something about that phrase
always reminded me of something,

42:12.280 --> 42:14.080
but I could never
put my finger on it.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.000
Then I saw it again the other day,
written down.

42:16.000 --> 42:16.920
Then I saw it again the other day,
written down.

42:16.960 --> 42:18.120
And I remembered.

42:35.040 --> 42:37.440
You won't find Janet because
she's not here anymore.

42:38.680 --> 42:40.000
Someone's found a way to break
through the checkpoint.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.480
Someone's found a way to break
through the checkpoint.

42:41.520 --> 42:43.560
They've found a way to
send her back in time.

42:50.160 --> 42:54.320
'Welcome to London
and the 2012 Olympic games...'

43:06.320 --> 43:08.440
And I know exactly where she is.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.760
If you wanna get her back...

43:13.120 --> 43:14.760
..you're gonna need my help.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.360
Fucking hell.

43:33.760 --> 43:35.280
You can time travel.
