01:01.625 --> 01:03.125
I… I…

01:03.916 --> 01:07.333
Okay, I'm going to assume
there's an explanation for this.

01:07.416 --> 01:08.416
Yeah. Looks to me

01:08.500 --> 01:11.500
like Miriam just killed Fairbanks
and tried to steal the artifact.

01:11.583 --> 01:15.250
I had nothing to do with this.
I found him here, just like you.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.291
You weren't at your post?

01:18.416 --> 01:21.208
I… No, there was a girl.

01:21.291 --> 01:24.875
I got rid of her, but I was trying
to find her again and… Where's Hira?

01:25.666 --> 01:29.166
Screw Hira!
You still have a dead body to explain.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.541
I didn't kill him.

01:33.666 --> 01:34.875
She's telling the truth.

01:35.875 --> 01:38.166
And why do you always take her side, huh?

01:38.250 --> 01:39.625
Because I know her.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.375
But even if I didn't,

01:41.458 --> 01:44.166
Miriam's the only person
who didn't care about the artifact.

01:44.250 --> 01:48.791
Those aren't stab wounds on his body,
and this whole thing is a complete mess.

01:49.333 --> 01:52.166
And you don't do messy.
At least, you didn't used to.

01:52.666 --> 01:54.541
Then, what happened?

01:54.625 --> 01:56.791
Fairbanks would have used
the same route we did.

01:56.875 --> 01:59.541
If a guard or a trap got him,
we would have seen something.

02:00.041 --> 02:02.208
I-- I don't know. But it wasn't her.

02:02.708 --> 02:06.708
Look, I know you want answers. I do too.
But we're not gonna get any right now.

02:07.208 --> 02:09.166
We need to focus on saving the others.

02:09.250 --> 02:13.458
We'll hide the body, circle back
to the vault, pick up our people, and run.

02:13.541 --> 02:15.958
If we move fast,
Qwydion's glyph should hold.

02:16.875 --> 02:17.708
Agreed.

02:21.166 --> 02:22.833
Are you two crazy?

02:22.916 --> 02:26.291
Even if I think you are innocent,
I'm not going back up there.

02:26.375 --> 02:28.250
I like being alive.

02:28.750 --> 02:32.375
Why are you so afraid?
You're the one with the bag of grenades.

02:32.458 --> 02:34.458
Emergency grenades!

02:34.541 --> 02:36.458
I think this qualifies.

02:36.541 --> 02:37.625
Well, I don't.

02:37.708 --> 02:39.416
This whole thing's a shit show,

02:39.500 --> 02:41.958
and I'm not gonna risk my life
running back into it.

02:42.750 --> 02:43.625
I'm sorry.

02:47.750 --> 02:48.583
You're right.

02:52.750 --> 02:57.125
It is an incredibly risky plan.
Long odds against an evil foe.

02:57.833 --> 03:00.958
The kind of thing that
only a Lord of Fortune could pull off,

03:01.041 --> 03:03.625
the kind of thing
bards sing about for ages.

03:04.666 --> 03:07.166
I have always wanted my own song.

03:07.708 --> 03:11.291
No! We don't even know
if they're still alive.

03:18.375 --> 03:19.708
Lacklon?

03:22.208 --> 03:23.833
Fine! I'll go.

03:23.916 --> 03:26.291
But until we know
who's responsible for all this,

03:26.375 --> 03:28.375
I'm holding on to the circle thing.

03:31.125 --> 03:32.333
Circulum.

03:32.416 --> 03:33.708
Whatever.

03:35.958 --> 03:38.250
Regular flock
of nug-humping idiots.

03:43.958 --> 03:45.500
Commander Tassia.

03:46.083 --> 03:48.416
A number of our forces
are trapped in the cathedral.

03:48.916 --> 03:50.875
Someone planted glyphs on the entrances.

03:52.041 --> 03:54.916
Well, there goes my last vain hope
that this was an accident.

03:55.416 --> 03:57.583
Everyone that was on watch
secure the palace perimeter.

03:57.666 --> 03:59.125
Everyone else, you're with me.

03:59.208 --> 04:00.416
Where are you going?

04:00.958 --> 04:02.125
To the cathedral.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.833
Once we get reinforcements,
we can sweep the grounds.

04:05.541 --> 04:07.625
-But first, open it.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.208
Wait. I-- I was happy to grab Neb,

04:12.291 --> 04:15.333
but I am not letting you
lock me in The Divine's apartments.

04:16.208 --> 04:18.416
This isn't about you.
It's about procedure.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.750
You are the highest-ranking Magister here.
Your safety is my first concern.

04:21.833 --> 04:23.875
I don't need your protection.

04:23.958 --> 04:25.583
I don't care what you need!

04:28.083 --> 04:31.791
This place was designed
to stop a full-scale slave revolt.

04:31.875 --> 04:35.041
It's going to try and kill
everyone who isn't in a secure location,

04:35.125 --> 04:38.500
and I need you to cooperate
so I can focus on saving them.

04:39.958 --> 04:41.583
This is my job, Rezaren.

04:42.250 --> 04:43.750
You have to let me do it.

04:53.208 --> 04:55.000
No one gets in or out, but me.

04:58.333 --> 04:59.166
No one.

05:01.041 --> 05:02.875
Tassia, can you please just--

05:02.958 --> 05:05.333
I'll secure the vault. First priority.

05:07.291 --> 05:08.125
Thank you.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.291
And, Tassia…

05:12.041 --> 05:12.875
be careful.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.833
I need my Knight Commander.

05:26.875 --> 05:28.333
We'll head for the cathedral,

05:28.416 --> 05:31.000
clear things out room by room,
just like we trained.

05:31.083 --> 05:33.625
If we see any sign
of who caused this, I'll reassess.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.708
But you said--

05:34.791 --> 05:35.875
I know what I said,

05:35.958 --> 05:39.125
but I'm not putting an artifact
above people's lives.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.833
Besides, that vault can defend itself.

06:16.916 --> 06:20.166
And to think, you were ready
to walk away from all this.

06:22.958 --> 06:27.041
Just because we're gonna die doesn't mean
I can't enjoy an old-fashioned slaughter.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.083
Come on.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.458
That looks like Qwydion's work.

06:44.583 --> 06:47.500
She must have been on her way back
when she got attacked by something.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.583
Went that way.

06:52.333 --> 06:54.833
Lacklon, wait.
Aren't we going to help her?

06:55.333 --> 06:57.333
You know how many hallways there are here?

06:57.416 --> 07:00.791
She could be anywhere,
while Hira's probably still in the vault.

07:01.583 --> 07:04.250
And it's her we're really after, ain't it?

07:05.708 --> 07:09.333
If Qwydion's on the move,
she's in less danger than Hira.

07:09.416 --> 07:11.416
We'll find her on the way back, I promise.

07:12.583 --> 07:15.458
Don't worry, Rolls.
Qwydion can handle herself.

07:31.541 --> 07:32.958
-Sorry!
-What in the--

07:34.166 --> 07:35.875
-Oh, shit.

07:48.125 --> 07:50.208
You think it's okay to breathe this shit?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.625
Definitely not, but we're almost there.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.250
Hira!

08:12.333 --> 08:13.666
You are such an idiot.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.958
So I've been told,
but I couldn't just leave you here.

08:21.291 --> 08:22.250
Where's Fairbanks?

08:24.916 --> 08:26.125
Let's get you out first.

08:26.708 --> 08:28.958
What kind of magic is this?
Do you know the spell?

08:29.041 --> 08:32.166
All I know is I can't get past it.
I tried everything.

08:37.416 --> 08:40.166
Miriam, we're not alone out here.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.583
We've got this! Just get Hira out.

08:43.666 --> 08:46.750
-There's got to be some kind of release.
-Couldn't find one.

08:47.250 --> 08:48.750
It was the first thing I checked.

08:49.250 --> 08:50.875
Then it's got to be out here.

08:52.125 --> 08:55.291
On the bright side, you're probably
the safest person in this place.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.750
All right, all right, that's enough.

09:16.833 --> 09:20.500
Tassia is very good at her job,
a credit to the Chantry,

09:20.583 --> 09:22.500
but sometimes even she goes too far.

09:24.541 --> 09:27.958
I am a Magister,
and a powerful one at that.

09:28.041 --> 09:31.000
It makes no sense to lock me up
when somebody could be out there now

09:31.083 --> 09:32.000
robbing The Divine.

09:35.416 --> 09:37.916
So in light
of this threat to the Imperium,

09:38.000 --> 09:41.625
I order you to let me pass!

09:45.958 --> 09:48.666
There are things more important
than the chain of command, Neb.

09:54.125 --> 09:56.333
Unless you're the perfect soldier.

09:58.291 --> 10:00.375
Which is exactly what I asked you to be.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.916
Roland, a little help!

10:23.750 --> 10:24.708
Catch!

10:28.708 --> 10:30.500
Show-off.

10:31.208 --> 10:33.166
-It's pronounced "thank you."

10:44.208 --> 10:47.250
How's it coming, elf?
We can't hold 'em off forever.

10:47.333 --> 10:48.458
Almost there.

10:52.166 --> 10:56.291
Miriam, stop. You're only
dulling your blades and wasting time.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.916
Maybe we can blast it.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.541
Not if you want me
to stay in one piece too.

11:03.375 --> 11:05.333
Hira, I'm trying to save you.

11:05.416 --> 11:06.416
You can't.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.708
But you can save the mission.

11:10.375 --> 11:14.375
Listen to me,
that bastard Fairbanks attacked me.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.416
He stole the Circulum and ran.

11:17.083 --> 11:18.541
What-- Why?

11:19.541 --> 11:23.166
I don't know, but he's probably
halfway across Tevinter by now.

11:25.375 --> 11:26.958
No, he isn't.

11:28.083 --> 11:31.041
He was hurt too.
Gave the Circulum to me, then…

11:32.125 --> 11:33.375
died in my arms.

11:34.791 --> 11:36.458
You have the Circulum?

11:38.041 --> 11:40.750
Miriam, you have to take it
to Kirkwall now.

11:41.250 --> 11:44.875
Kirkwall? I thought the Inquisition agent
was in Orlais.

11:44.958 --> 11:46.375
Fairbanks set that meeting.

11:46.458 --> 11:50.041
I have my own contact in Kirkwall
at a place called The Hanged Man.

11:50.541 --> 11:52.458
Hurry up in there!

11:54.875 --> 11:56.791
I don't care about the Circulum.

11:56.875 --> 12:00.000
Well, you have to,
because I don't trust anyone else.

12:12.750 --> 12:15.750
Kal, keep your shield up!
Eyes open, Rankin! Keep pushing!

12:15.833 --> 12:17.166
It's just another drill.

12:19.958 --> 12:23.583
Don't remember my drill mates
trying so hard to rip me to pieces!

12:25.666 --> 12:27.583
Whatever's on the end
of your blade,

12:27.666 --> 12:30.583
if it's between us and the cathedral,
strike it down.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.541
First rule of combat, guardsman.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.583
Never take your eyes off the enemy.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.666
One last push!

13:14.291 --> 13:15.625
Shield wall!

13:30.333 --> 13:32.291
First, rage demons, now walking corpses?

13:33.791 --> 13:35.750
What is wrong with these people?

14:07.666 --> 14:11.291
Ugh, come on! I hate this,
I hate this, I hate this, I hate this.

14:27.916 --> 14:29.458
-It's all right.

14:29.541 --> 14:31.625
I'm here to help, for some reason!

14:31.708 --> 14:32.958
-Move, please!

14:44.291 --> 14:46.958
Come on, dust for brains!

14:52.875 --> 14:53.750
Yay!

14:58.083 --> 14:58.916
Was that…

15:07.791 --> 15:10.083
Neb, stand aside.

15:15.625 --> 15:18.708
If you want to protect me,
then follow me. This way.

15:28.958 --> 15:30.208
What is that?

15:30.291 --> 15:31.458
What do you think?!

16:01.458 --> 16:02.666
Miriam, run!

16:03.208 --> 16:04.375
Not without you!

16:35.666 --> 16:37.791
Huh?

16:40.416 --> 16:42.916
Is it just me,
or are these things getting faster?

16:54.250 --> 16:56.541
Well, so much for my song.

16:58.916 --> 17:01.041
Miriam, we need your help!

17:03.291 --> 17:04.125
Damn it!

17:07.458 --> 17:11.041
Rolls, wh-- what are you doing?

17:12.500 --> 17:13.541
Improvising.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.500
Wait, no!

17:29.208 --> 17:32.375
You had to use
the whole damn bag?

17:35.208 --> 17:37.541
Miriam, time's up!

17:49.458 --> 17:50.291
No!

17:50.833 --> 17:51.708
I…

17:52.791 --> 17:53.916
What are you doing?

17:55.375 --> 17:56.375
Saving you.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.208
Hira.

17:59.916 --> 18:00.916
Hira!

18:02.666 --> 18:06.250
Miriam. Miriam, I'm sorry,
but we have to go now.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.791
But I just got you back.

18:42.416 --> 18:46.000
Aw, Maker's titties.
Why are there so damn many of you?

18:48.458 --> 18:50.375
Uh…

18:53.125 --> 18:54.083
That! I need that!

19:00.791 --> 19:02.208
Ugh. Gross.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.041
Everybody, get down!

19:24.458 --> 19:26.791
-Yay!

19:26.875 --> 19:28.625
To the giantess!

19:28.708 --> 19:30.583
Giantess!

19:30.666 --> 19:33.041
Giantess! Giantess!

19:33.125 --> 19:35.000
You're welcome. Thank-- Thank you.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.041
Okay, that's actually a little offensive.

19:37.125 --> 19:39.166
Look, does anyone know
how to get out of here?

19:46.708 --> 19:47.833
I've got you.

19:50.125 --> 19:54.208
Commander, we can't hold forever.
We have to find an opening.

19:54.291 --> 19:57.416
-Remember what I told you?
-Never take your eyes off the enemy?

19:58.583 --> 20:00.250
Let's see if he knows that too.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.416
Everyone, fall back behind me.

20:11.208 --> 20:12.666
-Now!

20:29.750 --> 20:31.458
For Tevinter!

20:40.541 --> 20:44.500
All right, Mages, get these glyphs down.
Everyone inside, help me sweep the palace.

20:44.583 --> 20:47.958
Everyone out here, find whoever did this
and bring them to me.

20:48.708 --> 20:50.083
Ma'am, yes, ma'am.

20:59.625 --> 21:02.625
This place
really is a death trap.

21:07.708 --> 21:08.541
Guys?

21:09.125 --> 21:12.458
Guys!
Oh, Maker, am I glad to see you!

21:12.541 --> 21:14.958
-This place is crazy and…

21:18.541 --> 21:20.375
-Less talk, more run.
-Yep, got it.

21:30.458 --> 21:33.083
Wait, what about Fairbanks and Hira?

21:33.166 --> 21:35.041
He's dead and she's trapped. Now go.

21:35.125 --> 21:36.166
What?

21:36.250 --> 21:37.375
I said go!

21:47.625 --> 21:48.875
They went this way.

21:52.541 --> 21:54.000
Stop right there!

21:56.416 --> 22:01.458
You did this, didn't you?
You're the reason all my friends are dead.

22:01.541 --> 22:05.375
Put the bow down, kid.
There are too many of us to shoot at once.

22:05.458 --> 22:08.000
At least I can
take one of you with me--

22:08.083 --> 22:08.958
-Oh!
