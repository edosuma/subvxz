out of my head,

03:55.902 --> 03:58.508
and it was like I was some son
of government experiment.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.341
And nobody cared.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.348
Mom was there,
and she couldn't stop yelling.

04:03.643 --> 04:05.486
“Get it out.
Take it out.

04:05.745 --> 04:06.849

04:36.676 --> 04:40.214
Anyway, it's a long stow,

04:40.513 --> 04:43.858
but he doesn't have
a bone back there.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.462
- You take care of him?

04:47.754 --> 04:49.791
Just him and you?

They say it gets easier,
but it doesn't.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.309

come in last night.

08:01.547 --> 08:04.892
I didn't come home
last night.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.994
Were you worried about me?

08:07.286 --> 08:10.290
- Oh, yeah, Lucy, you can't be
staying out all night.

08:10.590 --> 08:13.127

08:13.426 --> 08:14.530
- I'm not.

08:14.794 --> 08:16.432
Do you want some coffee?

08:16.729 --> 08:18.231

08:28.307 --> 08:30.150
- He's at the store.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.548

09:25.398 --> 09:27.344
- I just asked her that.
- What? I'm not.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.943
All I did was ask if you tried
talking to anyone.

09:30.202 --> 09:32.682
- What's the point?

09:32.972 --> 09:34.815
I could be a ?y.

Hell, I am a ?y.

- Could be.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.353
- You're not a fly, Nat.
Okay, stop it.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.250
- She's so selfish.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.188
You don't have to spend
even! day alone.

09:44.483 --> 09:47.430

have a girlfriend,

09:49.322 --> 09:50.960

10:09.175 --> 10:12.054
Don't you feel it, Amy?

10:12.345 --> 10:14.689
- No, she can't feel it.

Hey, how are you?

11:42.201 --> 11:44.647
You look...

11:47.173 --> 11:50.052

Have a good day at school.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.581
- Yeah, right.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.082
- How did you like
"The Sheltering Sky"?

13:00.379 --> 13:02.325
- Uh, I mean...

13:02.581 --> 13:06.620
it really got to me,
like, under my skin.

13:08.854 --> 13:11.357
- Here.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.127
It's worth every page.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.875

Go!

14:23.629 --> 14:25.666
Wctory!

- Who's that?

14:53.559 --> 14:56.096
. Hey-

14:56.395 --> 14:59.376
- Hi.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.677
- Could I come in
for a minute?

15:05.671 --> 15:08.208
- Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.

15:18.550 --> 15:21.030
- Hey, how's it going?
I'm Sam.

15:21.320 --> 15:25.598
Look, this is a crazy idea,

15:25.858 --> 15:27.963
but whatever, right?

15:28.227 --> 15:30.833
Um, I just lost my job,

15:31.096 --> 15:33.235
and I need a cheap place
to rent,

15:33.532 --> 15:35.341
and I was thinking

15:35.601 --> 15:38.741
if you had some extra space,
you know,

15:39.038 --> 15:42.247
I could help out
and pay some rent.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.521
- Um...

15:46.612 --> 15:50.651
Well, we sure could
use the money.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.156
This could work.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.590
- Yeah.
It's great.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.696
Better than living in my car.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.128
- I mean,
what kind of shit person

15:58.424 --> 15:59.425
thinks he can live here?

15:59.725 --> 16:01.068
I mean, there's no room here.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.136
- It'll be fine
if he's in the living room.

16:04.396 --> 16:07.002
- What--What about the TV?

16:07.266 --> 16:10.042
- Um, we'll put the TV
in the kitchen.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.645
- The kitchen?

16:11.937 --> 16:13.917
You can't put my TV
in the kitchen.

16:14.206 --> 16:17.016
- Why not?

16:45.504 --> 16:46.778
- Yeah?

16:47.072 --> 16:49.780
- Um...

16:50.075 --> 16:51.748
I was just gonna go
to the store,

16:52.011 --> 16:53.285
so I was wondering
if you wanted

16:53.579 --> 16:56.788
to have dinner
with us tonight.

16:59.785 --> 17:02.493
- Yeah, that'd be great.

17:02.788 --> 17:05.496
Um, hey, you need a ride
to the store?

17:05.790 --> 17:08.601
- Oh, no, that's okay.
I can just-I can walk.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.840
- No, don't walk.
Just take my truck.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.076
The keys are on the table,
okay?

17:13.332 --> 17:16.779
- Okay.
Thanks.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.804
This is fantastic.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.877
Thanks.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.172
- Yeah, she never cooks
like this for us.

17:53.472 --> 17:55.076
- This is like
normal family food.

17:55.340 --> 17:58.344
- That's not true.
I cook for you.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.922
- What happened
to your parents?

18:03.849 --> 18:07.991
- I drove them crazy.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.960
- I made pudding.

18:27.873 --> 18:29.716
Shh.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.722
Do you really think
your sister would care

18:34.012 --> 18:35.218
if I used the front door?

18:35.514 --> 18:37.118
- It's a school night.

18:37.382 --> 18:38.725
- Whose crappy suburban?

18:39.017 --> 18:40.792
- Some guy who's renting
the living room.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.657
- Cute?
- Old.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.773
. Hey-

18:51.063 --> 18:53.509
Hi.

18:53.765 --> 18:56.302

Are you comfortable?

18:56.602 --> 18:57.979
- Yeah.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.910
Yeah, this is great.

19:01.206 --> 19:05.677
- 'Cause, you know...

19:05.944 --> 19:10.051
my bed is a little bit
more comfortable, like-

19:11.950 --> 19:14.453
- Yeah, I was thinking
that maybe we shouldn't,

19:14.753 --> 19:16.460
you know, anymore,

19:16.755 --> 19:18.735
being that
we're roommates now.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.471
- Oh, yeah, okay.
Totally.

19:21.760 --> 19:22.966
- You know,
what do they say?

19:23.262 --> 19:24.969
Like, "Don't eat
where you shit."

19:25.264 --> 19:27.938
- I think it's,
"Don't shit where you...“

19:28.233 --> 19:32.045
Okay.

19:32.304 --> 19:33.942
Okay, um...good night.

Fucking idiot.

19:45.617 --> 19:48.427
- "My house is as cold
as the Atlantic Ocean.

19:48.687 --> 19:53.193
"These people, my parents,

"Thy can't there be
some kind of magic potion

19:56.161 --> 19:58.539
that could bring them back
to the land of emotion?"

19:58.830 --> 20:02.607
- Oh, my god.
You are, like, amazing.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.848
Thanks.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.674
Now let's hear yours.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.680
- Come on.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.511
- Not after that.
No way.

20:19.885 --> 20:23.924
- "My mother told me
'Let's play hide and seek.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.999
"You hide, I'll count to 10.'

20:27.292 --> 20:29.465
"I hid under the sink.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.571

"I could not remember
what number came next,

20:41.406 --> 20:45.912
- It doesn't rhyme
or have any pentameter.

20:46.211 --> 20:49.021
- I know.
It sucks.

20:49.314 --> 20:51.851
- Hey, come on.
It doesn't suck.

20:52.150 --> 20:54.323
You'll get the hang of it.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.190
- Thanks.

20:56.488 --> 20:58.490
- I better go.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.259
- No. Why?
Don't go.

21:00.559 --> 21:03.403
- My mom's gonna wake me up
for school in a few hours.

21:03.695 --> 21:05.402
- You should sleep over
sometime.

21:07.332 --> 21:10.870
There's no way my mom
would let me sleep here.

21:58.383 --> 22:00.021
There's another one.

22:05.590 --> 22:06.728
Going right back to it.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.979
This shit is funny.

22:20.772 --> 22:23.048
Hey, man, you want a beer?

22:23.308 --> 22:24.912
- I don't drink.

" No?

who doesn't drink?

Not cool, huh?

22:32.017 --> 22:33.189
- No, I don't care.

22:33.485 --> 22:35.931
- Of course you don't.
Nobody does.

22:38.256 --> 22:41.100
You're an outcast if you don't
do that stuff, you know.

22:41.360 --> 22:45.206
High school,
I was like this--this outcast.

22:45.497 --> 22:48.273
People like you
making me an outcast.

22:52.838 --> 22:54.818
I can't move my neck.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.815
- I hated high school.

23:00.445 --> 23:03.426
You're a horrible bike rider.

23:05.484 --> 23:07.589
- Do you have more of these?

23:07.853 --> 23:12.199
- That's my last one,
but...

23:12.491 --> 23:14.994
my brother knows a dealer.

23:15.293 --> 23:18.240
- Are you gonna go
to fifth period?

23:18.497 --> 23:20.977
- I can't do math today.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.235
- Want to go to the mall?

23:23.535 --> 23:25.674
Five-finger discount.

23:27.506 --> 23:30.646
- And you try to tell
how you feel about it.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.287
You find that, out of all
the words in the world,

23:33.578 --> 23:34.784
there are only--

23:35.080 --> 23:36.286
- Who would watch this?

23:36.581 --> 23:38.686
Hey! That's fine!

23:38.984 --> 23:40.190
That's a very pretty speech.

23:40.485 --> 23:42.795
- Want me to get that?

23:43.054 --> 23:44.931
- I got it.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.599
Hello?
- Now I want to make a speech.

23:49.895 --> 23:52.341
Gentlemen of the Academy
and...

23:52.597 --> 23:55.237
- What a loser.

23:55.534 --> 23:58.538
Can't believe
she got caught shoplifting.

23:58.837 --> 24:00.214
Save-man?

24:00.505 --> 24:03.042
Pathetic.

24:03.341 --> 24:06.618
So you're a bum, huh?

24:06.878 --> 24:08.880
- Son of.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.957
- Well, Amy doesn't need
any more bums.

24:12.217 --> 24:13.423
- Have there been a lot?

24:13.718 --> 24:15.823
- What?
- Bums.

24:17.856 --> 24:22.327
- Can you get that?
- Can't you get it yourself?

24:22.594 --> 24:25.803
- I get dizzy when I bend over.
Just get it, all right?

24:32.304 --> 24:33.977
- Here, man.

24:34.272 --> 24:37.276
- Cool.

24:37.576 --> 24:40.750
- Hey, dude...
look, they're coming.

24:44.883 --> 24:47.659
- You just--You can't shoplift,
all right, Lucy?

24:47.919 --> 24:49.262
You got to grow up.

24:49.554 --> 24:51.261
- I know.
I just always mess up.

24:51.556 --> 24:53.729
Why do I always mess up?
- You don't always mess up.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.767
- Yes, she does.
- See?

24:56.061 --> 24:57.665
It's not your fault, all right?

24:57.929 --> 24:59.135
It's me.
It's mine.

24:59.431 --> 25:01.377
I'm just not doing
a very good job.

25:01.633 --> 25:05.445
- You do a great job, Amy.

25:05.737 --> 25:07.842
- You do a great job.

25:10.475 --> 25:13.285

25:44.476 --> 25:46.615
- I really like your brother.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.051
He's a cool kid, you know?

25:49.347 --> 25:50.849
- Yeah. Good.

25:51.149 --> 25:53.129
I'm glad.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.762
Is everything okay?

25:55.053 --> 25:57.090
- Oh, yeah.

26:07.999 --> 26:09.979
Can I ask you a question?

26:12.170 --> 26:16.050
- It depends.

26:16.341 --> 26:18.343
- You have an orgasm?

26:18.643 --> 26:21.351
- What?

26:21.646 --> 26:23.455
- You know, like,
did you come?

26:25.584 --> 26:28.064
Didn't I act like I did?
- Yeah.

26:28.353 --> 26:30.856
I mean, I just was thinking
about how you are...

26:31.156 --> 26:32.499
in this house, you know?

26:32.757 --> 26:35.738
It's crazy here,
and you don't yell or freak out,

26:36.027 --> 26:39.304
so I was just wondering
if you feel me, you know?

26:42.534 --> 26:44.309
- Do you really think
you would be here

26:44.569 --> 26:47.743
if I didn't feel anything?

26:48.039 --> 26:49.916
- Are you using me?

26:50.208 --> 26:52.552
- No.

26:52.844 --> 26:56.018
- 'Cause I'm not a gigolo.

27:01.686 --> 27:06.294
I could be yours.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.037
So talk to me.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.399
You know, tell me something.
- What about?

27:11.696 --> 27:13.539
- Well, you ask questions
about a person,

27:13.798 --> 27:15.141
you learn stuff, you know?

27:15.433 --> 27:17.413
Just like...

27:17.702 --> 27:20.546
- Okay, you start.
Ask a question.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.341
<i>_ OW?</i>

27:22.641 --> 27:26.487
Your brother, did he really
drive your parents crazy?

27:26.778 --> 27:30.453
- No.

27:30.749 --> 27:32.956
Where are you from?
- What? No.

27:33.251 --> 27:35.527
You got to answer it
better than that, come on.

27:35.787 --> 27:38.631
Did he really drive
your parents crazy?

27:42.961 --> 27:45.066
No, they just left.

27:47.098 --> 27:49.738
- Where'd they go?

27:51.770 --> 27:55.741
- They said
they were going to Florida.

27:56.007 --> 27:59.716
Vacation.

28:00.011 --> 28:04.289
And then
they didn't come back.

28:04.582 --> 28:08.291
They were kind of
messed up anyway, but...

28:08.586 --> 28:13.592
I just got a postcard...

28:13.858 --> 28:16.031
that said...

28:16.327 --> 28:18.534
"Sorry, can't do it anymore.

28:20.932 --> 28:24.539
So little time.
Love, mom and dad."

28:26.504 --> 28:28.814
- I'm from Cleveland.

28:35.013 --> 28:39.519
- What are you doin' here?

28:39.818 --> 28:41.491
- My whole sense of things
kind of got out of whack

28:41.786 --> 28:44.266
after my brother died.

28:47.892 --> 28:51.169
I was in my car.

28:51.463 --> 28:54.501
I was driving the car,

28:54.799 --> 28:58.906
and we were both drunk.

28:59.170 --> 29:01.776
That doesn't go away,
you know?

29:02.040 --> 29:03.917
Thinking about him,

29:04.209 --> 29:08.351
wondering if he knew
what was happening.

29:08.646 --> 29:11.456
Did it hufi?

29:11.716 --> 29:13.525
Or was he mad at me?

29:13.818 --> 29:17.356
He went
through the windshield.

29:17.655 --> 29:19.100
- Um, Sam, um...

29:19.357 --> 29:20.995
- What?

29:21.259 --> 29:22.465
- I'm sorry.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.798
I'm just not good
at this kind of talk.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.234
It just...

29:26.531 --> 29:28.374
kind of makes me nauseous.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.612
I'm sorry.

29:30.869 --> 29:32.212
Sorry

29:41.012 --> 29:43.959
I could never take

29:44.215 --> 29:51.531
I was never one to be took

29:51.790 --> 29:54.100
Someone says we'll make it

29:54.392 --> 29:57.601
But I never thought
that I could

30:02.033 --> 30:05.139
Listen up, I mean it

30:05.403 --> 30:06.575
- What are we gonna do
with this thing?

30:06.871 --> 30:07.906
- I don't know.

30:08.206 --> 30:09.378
It's been there
for about a decade.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.018
- Does it work?
- No.

30:11.309 --> 30:12.515
- I'll take it to the dump
if you want.

<i>_ OW?</i>

30:14.145 --> 30:15.783
Think I wouldn't notice

30:16.080 --> 30:20.028
Something else
is fighting my fear

30:22.987 --> 30:25.661
If I had one more tn!

30:25.957 --> 30:29.461
I could fly with her

30:29.761 --> 30:33.709
And hide away the years

30:33.965 --> 30:36.502
If I had one more life

30:36.801 --> 30:40.146
I could die with her

30:40.438 --> 30:43.248
And whisper in her ear

30:49.914 --> 30:51.951
- There's coffee if you want.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.230
- Oh, great.

30:54.485 --> 30:57.022
- You look cleaned up.

30:57.322 --> 30:59.632
- Yeah, I may get a job.

30:59.924 --> 31:02.461
- About time.

31:04.028 --> 31:06.304
- Yeah, I'm gonna get
some money together,

31:06.598 --> 31:09.044
you know, go back on the road
so I can get out of your hair.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.610
- You're not in my hair.

31:15.340 --> 31:18.810
- What are you doing?

31:19.110 --> 31:21.556
- Um, this is my job.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.329
- You should come.

31:30.455 --> 31:32.401
A little road trip
might do you some good.

- Oh, no,
I can't go anywhere.

- I don't know.

31:44.969 --> 31:46.312
- You want
to come over tonight?

31:46.571 --> 31:48.915
- I can't.
I'm punished.

31:49.207 --> 31:50.584
- So?
Sneak out.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.411
- Look, I'll call you later.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.656
- Wait, do you want a ride
to Creature's party Friday?

31:54.913 --> 31:57.018
I got the gas station guy
to drive us.

31:57.315 --> 31:58.988
- Look.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.729
There's my mom.

32:01.019 --> 32:03.158
I'm not really allowed
to hang out with you anymore.

32:03.421 --> 32:07.369
So keep your distance, or my mom
will take away my computer.

32:11.562 --> 32:13.405
- Hey, Nat.

32:13.698 --> 32:15.871
How are ya this morning?

I just, um--

32:25.276 --> 32:26.721
I care.

32:27.011 --> 32:30.390
Bullshit. Nobody cares.

32:30.682 --> 32:33.458
- I used to think that.
People care.

32:33.718 --> 32:36.927
Hey, you want to sit down,
eat with us?

32:44.896 --> 32:47.604

- Why not?

32:47.899 --> 32:49.378
- Have you tried
the cornbread?

32:49.634 --> 32:53.275
- I like cornbread.

33:54.365 --> 33:56.470
- Sure, we could use a man.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.770
Nine bucks an hour,
6:00 A.M.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.243
- Nine bucks an hour?

34:03.841 --> 34:05.377
Nine bucks an hour.

34:10.848 --> 34:14.351
What do you make of death?
Kind of crazy, right?

34:14.652 --> 34:17.257
You know how we're just here,
and then we're not here?

34:17.522 --> 34:20.469
You don't really think
about it,

34:20.725 --> 34:22.329
that death is forever.

34:22.627 --> 34:24.833
- What the fuck
is this guy talking about?

34:25.129 --> 34:27.666
- I'm just saying how we're all
gonna die one day, you know?

34:27.965 --> 34:29.467
You're gonna die.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.578
You're gonna be gone
from this world, man.

34:32.870 --> 34:34.645
And what's your life
gonna be about?

34:34.906 --> 34:37.909
Sitting in this bar,
getting fucking shitfaced?

34:38.208 --> 34:39.483
- What are you talking about?

34:39.744 --> 34:41.882
- It doesn't matter, man,
'cause...

34:42.179 --> 34:44.786
I think I found out
what it's all about, you know?

34:45.049 --> 34:48.393
There's this girl, right,
and she's, like--

34:48.686 --> 34:50.495
She's, like, kind of awesome.

34:50.755 --> 34:54.862
She's got, like--I don't know,
like, a heart, you know?

34:55.159 --> 34:57.366
I met her right here
in this very bar.

34:57.662 --> 34:59.369
I was passing through.

34:59.664 --> 35:02.372
Then I stayed.
It's like fate.

35:02.667 --> 35:05.113
- What's her name?
She live in town?

35:05.369 --> 35:06.712
- Oh, yeah,

35:07.004 --> 35:08.779
Her name's Amy.

- Uh...

35:12.343 --> 35:13.720
Weird. I don't even know
her last name.

- Where's she live?

35:16.347 --> 35:18.884
- She lives at 80 Flat Lane.

35:19.183 --> 35:21.459
- Amy Bear?

35:23.554 --> 35:26.228
If it's her, Amy Bear,
then...

35:26.524 --> 35:29.004
Yeah, she's got a heart

35:39.370 --> 35:40.815
- What?

35:41.072 --> 35:42.676
- Nothing.
We know her.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.920
She used to come in here...

35:45.209 --> 35:46.916
a lot.

35:47.211 --> 35:48.246
- "A lot.“

35:48.546 --> 35:50.423
What happened to her
anyway, huh?

35:50.715 --> 35:53.161
She disappeared into that house,
doesn't come out no more.

35:53.417 --> 35:55.590
- Mm.
That's not true.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.093
She must have come out
the other night

35:57.388 --> 35:58.662
when she met Romeo here.

36:04.462 --> 36:06.567
Mm.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.869
Well, seriously, a lot of...

36:10.168 --> 36:13.274
sluts are actually
really nice girls.

36:15.273 --> 36:17.116
- Whoa!

36:19.410 --> 36:22.584
- Hey!

36:25.850 --> 36:27.295
Asshole!

36:27.585 --> 36:30.862
- No. A snake.
Temptation, you idiot?

36:31.122 --> 36:33.625
Look, Gary says that--

36:33.925 --> 36:36.872
- Isn't Gary all born-again,
or whatever?

36:39.263 --> 36:41.209
- Listen to me, Lucy.

36:41.465 --> 36:44.844
Sam wants Amy,
but he doesn't want us.

36:45.136 --> 36:47.514
He's trying to take Amy away.
- No.

36:47.805 --> 36:50.979
- Hi. Mr. Banks?

36:51.275 --> 36:55.985
Yeah, no, the envelopes
are ready for UPS.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.588
- Amy belongs here.

36:57.848 --> 37:00.351
- Amy can't go anywhere.
- No.

37:00.651 --> 37:05.964
Not if we can expose the truth
that Sam is really a snake.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.033
- How do we do that?

37:08.326 --> 37:10.272
- You have to seduce him.

37:10.528 --> 37:12.735
- Are you crazy?

37:13.030 --> 37:14.509
<i>-If I-</i>

37:14.799 --> 37:18.804
If I were to take a vacation,

37:19.070 --> 37:20.913
would that, like, be okay?

37:21.205 --> 37:23.185
- Do you want Amy to leave us?

37:23.474 --> 37:24.976
- What do I do?

37:25.243 --> 37:26.586
- Well, you're a girl.
Figure it out.

37:26.877 --> 37:28.879
Wear--
Wear, uh,

37:29.180 --> 37:32.821
some kind of a bra, and then
have some son of a dress.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.427
It's not that hard.

37:34.719 --> 37:37.825
- Okay, thank you.
Bye.

37:41.192 --> 37:43.297
- What's for dinner, Ame?

37:43.561 --> 37:46.269
- Spaghetti, I think.

37:46.564 --> 37:48.100
- Where is Sam?

38:11.222 --> 38:12.599
- What happened?

38:12.890 --> 38:15.700
- Well, I just received
some tough information.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.634
Got me a little upset.
- What information?

38:18.929 --> 38:22.274
<i>_</i> This guy...

38:25.569 --> 38:29.278
wanted to pay me $9 an hour
for construction.

38:29.573 --> 38:32.349
$9 an hour my ass.

38:32.610 --> 38:34.317
That's pure and utter
bullshit.

38:34.612 --> 38:36.319
- Well, 9's better
than freeloading.

38:36.614 --> 38:38.560
- It's good to stand up
for your rights.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.818
- I stood up.

38:41.118 --> 38:44.395
- You don't look so good.
- I'll be all right.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.635
- Here.

38:46.924 --> 38:51.304
- Since you didn't get a job
and you can't pay the rent,

38:51.595 --> 38:53.575
maybe you could pick me up
tomorrow from detention.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.970
- Oh, no, you don't have
to do that.

38:56.267 --> 38:59.578
- Oh, it's cool, you know?
I'll do it.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.215
- Thanks.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.788
- Is your last name Bear'?

39:11.982 --> 39:13.586
- Yeah.

39:24.428 --> 39:27.637
Sadly now, I'm a simple man

39:31.702 --> 39:35.673
Hang my head on what I can

39:40.010 --> 39:43.514
Overdone and overwrought

39:45.850 --> 39:50.060
There ain't a fight
that I haven't fought

39:53.391 --> 39:56.702
Go home

39:56.994 --> 39:58.132
From here

39:58.396 --> 40:00.034
- I have this hope.

40:00.331 --> 40:04.302
This dream
that if we're good,

40:04.568 --> 40:08.345
if we live our lives well,

40:08.639 --> 40:11.848
that there's something
after all this, you know.

40:12.143 --> 40:15.181
Just like this,
but better because...

40:15.479 --> 40:17.925
there's no fear.

40:18.182 --> 40:21.823
No one leaves.

40:22.086 --> 40:25.397
No one dies
because we're eternal.

40:25.689 --> 40:28.829
Forever in paradise.

40:29.093 --> 40:33.132
- Paradise.

40:42.373 --> 40:44.876
- Yo.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.452
Hey!
Sorry I'm late-.

40:51.215 --> 40:53.559
How was school today?

40:53.851 --> 40:56.730
- Not too bad.

40:57.021 --> 40:59.399
- Yeah?
Did you go to all your classes?

40:59.690 --> 41:02.000
- Most of 'em.

41:04.395 --> 41:06.841
- Hey, what's that?
- Adderall.

41:07.097 --> 41:08.542
It's fun.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.642
Creature's
having a party later.

41:10.935 --> 41:12.471
- Creature?

41:12.770 --> 41:14.477
- I don't think
that's his real name.

41:14.772 --> 41:17.116
You should come.

41:17.408 --> 41:18.580
He's old, too.

41:18.876 --> 41:21.857
I mean, not like you.
Like, really old.

41:22.112 --> 41:23.716
And most of the people there
will be older than me,

41:23.981 --> 41:27.019
so you won't have to feel,
you know, like a pedophile.

41:29.420 --> 41:31.798
- What's Adderall
make you feel like?

41:32.089 --> 41:34.296
- Just really social,
and focused,

41:34.592 --> 41:37.402
and on, and kind of speedy.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.800
- Can I tn! it?

41:40.097 --> 41:41.735
- It'll cost you.

41:41.999 --> 41:44.707
- How much?

41:45.002 --> 41:46.538
- 30 bucks.

41:46.837 --> 41:49.044
- Is there, like,
a family discount?

41:49.340 --> 41:52.878
- 'Cause you're fucking Amy?

41:53.177 --> 41:54.315
- All right,
I'll give you ten bucks now,

41:54.612 --> 41:57.252
and 20 when I get a job.
Cool?

41:57.515 --> 41:59.791
<i>- You comm' m the party'!?</i>

42:00.084 --> 42:02.064
- I don't know.
Maybe.

42:02.319 --> 42:04.925
<i>_ OW?</i>

42:15.999 --> 42:19.003
- You shouldn't do
so many drugs.

42:19.302 --> 42:21.782
- I'm only 16.
- So?

42:22.039 --> 42:23.848
- I got plenty of time
to straighten out.

42:24.141 --> 42:25.745
- Yeah, good point.

42:33.316 --> 42:36.263
- Sam is coming
to Creature's party tonight.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.466
' Oh, yeah?

42:38.722 --> 42:40.360
- I don't know.
You want to go?

42:40.657 --> 42:43.331
- Me?
No, I'm good.

42:43.627 --> 42:46.233
My party days
are kind of over.

42:46.496 --> 42:48.339
But you guys have fun.

42:48.632 --> 42:50.976
- Yeah.

42:51.234 --> 42:52.679
- Here's your magic pill.

42:52.969 --> 42:55.609
- Lucy, I've told you,
no drugs in the house, okay?

42:55.872 --> 42:56.976
Except for pot.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.015
- It's Adderall.
- So?

42:59.309 --> 43:00.652
- It's not a drug.
- Yes, it is.

43:00.911 --> 43:02.549
- It's legal.
- Only if you need it.

43:02.846 --> 43:04.223
- Hey, if it bothers ya,
I won't do it.

43:04.514 --> 43:06.323
- You can do
whatever you want.

43:06.583 --> 43:07.755
- How come he can take it
and I can't?

43:08.051 --> 43:09.155
- You know what?

43:09.419 --> 43:10.625
Both of you can do
what you want.

43:10.921 --> 43:13.060
Just do whatever
you want to do.

43:15.826 --> 43:19.103
- Did I piss you off, Ame?
- No.

43:19.362 --> 43:22.809
- 'Cause I feel like I did.
- You didn't.

43:23.066 --> 43:25.012
- Give it back.
- What?

43:25.268 --> 43:26.645
- The Adderall.
Give it back.

43:26.937 --> 43:28.814
- Why?
- You didn't piss me off, okay?

43:29.106 --> 43:31.313
- Here, I'll give it back.

43:31.608 --> 43:32.746
- Look, I don't care!

43:33.043 --> 43:34.078
Both of you just do
what you want.

43:34.377 --> 43:35.549
Do whatever you want to do.

43:35.846 --> 43:37.120
- See what you did?
Nat was right.

43:37.380 --> 43:38.552
You are a snake!

43:38.849 --> 43:40.021
- What do you mean
I'm a snake?

43:40.283 --> 43:41.489
- I don't have to go
to the party, Amy,

43:41.785 --> 43:43.594
or I could come home, like,
with a curfew.

43:43.887 --> 43:45.332
- Lucy, would you please
just stop being a baby

43:45.589 --> 43:46.624
for five minutes?

43:46.923 --> 43:48.231
Please, just stop.
- I hate you!

43:50.560 --> 43:52.562
Oh, shit.
Lucy.

43:52.863 --> 43:55.309
Lucy.
Shit.

43:55.565 --> 43:57.875
Lucy.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.478
Wait!
Lucy, come on.

43:59.769 --> 44:01.248
I love you.
You didn't do anything wrong.

44:01.538 --> 44:03.211
All right?
Come on, now stop this.

44:03.473 --> 44:04.816
Stop.
Come on, let's go back inside.

44:05.108 --> 44:06.246
Let's go.
- Amy.

44:06.543 --> 44:08.250
- What?

44:08.545 --> 44:10.388
- I got bruises.

44:10.647 --> 44:12.593
- What?

44:12.883 --> 44:15.591
_ See?

44:15.886 --> 44:17.160
- Oh, God.

44:17.420 --> 44:18.694
What is it?

44:18.955 --> 44:20.832
- I don't know.
I got 'em on my legs too.

44:21.124 --> 44:22.501
- What do you mean,
sweetheart?

44:22.792 --> 44:24.465
What are they?
- I don't know.

44:24.761 --> 44:26.035
- Are you sick?

44:26.296 --> 44:28.003
- No.
- She should see a doctor.

44:28.298 --> 44:29.800
- Lucy, why didn't you
come to me, huh?

44:30.100 --> 44:31.238
Why didn't you tell me?

44:31.501 --> 44:32.707
That's what you do.
You come to me.

44:33.003 --> 44:35.005
Why didn't you tell me?
- Hey, hey, hey, relax.

44:35.305 --> 44:36.978
There's no point
in getting upset

44:37.274 --> 44:39.948
until we know
what it is, okay?

44:40.243 --> 44:42.519
- Okay, we'll go
to the doctor, okay?

44:42.779 --> 44:45.487
Come on.

45:16.179 --> 45:17.385
- That's my ride to the party.

45:17.681 --> 45:19.217
- Okay.
Come here.

45:19.516 --> 45:22.190
Have fun tonight.

45:22.485 --> 45:23.623
- Ow, Ame.

45:23.887 --> 45:25.423
You're squashing me.

45:25.722 --> 45:27.531
<i>_ OW?</i>

45:27.824 --> 45:30.862
- Be safe.

45:35.498 --> 45:39.173
Don't worry about it.
You'll take her to the doctor.

45:39.469 --> 45:40.812
- I hate the frickin' doctor.

45:41.071 --> 45:43.608
He's got nothing but bad news
for this family.

45:46.076 --> 45:48.682
- Did I miss the drama?

45:48.979 --> 45:51.186
- Yeah.
- That's a relief.

45:51.481 --> 45:53.825
- What's up, man?

45:54.084 --> 45:57.122
- Amy, get me a carrot.

45:57.420 --> 46:00.230
- Oh, I'll get it.

46:05.528 --> 46:08.532
Look at us, like a family,
me getting Nat a carrot.

46:08.832 --> 46:10.539
- I can get my own carrot.

46:14.204 --> 46:17.549
- Look at that, Nat.
Amy's smiling, see that?

46:17.841 --> 46:19.343
It's good having me here,
isn't it?

46:19.609 --> 46:20.815
- Is it?

46:21.111 --> 46:23.421
- It's good, right?
- Is it, Amy?

46:23.713 --> 46:25.056
- Is it?

46:25.348 --> 46:28.852
- I'm not saying
it's not good, okay?

46:38.728 --> 46:41.766
- Let me tell ya
how I really got in a fight.

46:42.065 --> 46:43.237
- What do you mean?

46:43.533 --> 46:45.012
I thought
you had a job interview.

46:45.268 --> 46:47.544
- Well, I did, but that's not
why I got in a fight.

46:47.804 --> 46:49.078
You see,
after the interview,

46:49.372 --> 46:51.045
I was feeling kind of down
and all, you know,

46:51.308 --> 46:53.652
so I went to the bar, and...

46:53.943 --> 46:55.479
you know,
I was talking to this guy,

46:55.779 --> 46:57.656
and he basically said
you used to be,

46:57.947 --> 47:01.724
you know, a little...

47:01.985 --> 47:04.192
- What?

47:04.487 --> 47:06.194
- You know.

47:06.489 --> 47:09.936
- No.
I used to be a little what?

47:10.226 --> 47:11.864
- Well, he said you used to be
a little slutty.

47:12.128 --> 47:13.607
You see, but the point is,
it doesn't matter.

47:13.897 --> 47:15.376
You see, I thought it does,
but it doesn't.

47:15.632 --> 47:17.111
As long as you're my slut,
who cares?

47:17.400 --> 47:18.879
- I'm nobody's nothing, okay?

47:19.135 --> 47:20.671
- Get the hell out of here,
all right?

47:20.970 --> 47:22.415
- Amy, you don't understand.
That's not what I meant.

47:22.672 --> 47:25.812
- God or Jesus or somebody
is gonna come back,

47:26.109 --> 47:28.885
and they're gonna judge who's
been good and who's been bad.

47:29.145 --> 47:32.615
And the good will go to Heaven,
and the bad will go to hell.

47:32.916 --> 47:34.224
Well, Amy,
she'll go to paradise.

47:34.484 --> 47:36.088
Do you know--
Where will you go, huh?

47:36.353 --> 47:37.889
She'll go to paradise,
all right?

47:38.188 --> 47:40.327
- What did he say it was
supposed to be like, paradise?

47:40.623 --> 47:43.627
- This is paradise right here.
This is it.

47:43.927 --> 47:45.065
Yeah, this is paradise.

47:45.328 --> 47:47.205
Halle-fucking-Iujah

48:56.699 --> 48:58.906
What?

49:00.503 --> 49:02.710
- Can I just come in
for one minute?

49:04.541 --> 49:06.817
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I can be stupid, and I just-

49:07.076 --> 49:08.384
- Well, you should be sorry-.

49:08.678 --> 49:11.124
I went to college.
A year.

49:11.381 --> 49:12.860
But I had a frickin'
scholarship.

49:13.116 --> 49:15.460
And then my parents just leave,
just up and gone.

49:15.752 --> 49:17.288
They just left.

49:17.587 --> 49:19.863
And I had to come back
and be a mom.

49:20.123 --> 49:21.727
- I'm sorry, okay?

49:22.025 --> 49:25.472
- So I got a little stir-crazy.
What was I supposed to do?

49:25.728 --> 49:27.071
- Look, it's just, you know,
how we met.

49:27.363 --> 49:28.706
I guess I was feeling
a little uncomfortable

49:28.965 --> 49:30.467
with how you kind of picked me
up in a bar.

49:30.767 --> 49:32.110
Whatever.
It doesn't matter.

49:32.402 --> 49:34.678
- I picked you up in a bar
because I'm a slut. Duh!

49:34.938 --> 49:37.976
Why'd you come home with a slut
if they freak you out so much?

49:38.274 --> 49:40.049
- You have a nice butt?

49:40.310 --> 49:42.517
- Screw you.

49:42.812 --> 49:43.847
You're a liar.

49:44.147 --> 49:45.626
You're probably not even
from Cleveland.

49:45.915 --> 49:48.452
- I'm from Cleveland, Ohio.

49:48.751 --> 49:51.630
My brother died,
and Iwent to Mexico.

49:51.921 --> 49:54.026
- You went to Mexico?

49:54.290 --> 49:57.237
- I drove there.

49:57.494 --> 50:00.031
Lots of cigarettes,

50:00.330 --> 50:03.174
listened to a lot of music,

50:03.466 --> 50:07.073
and then I came through here
and met you.

50:07.337 --> 50:10.682
I like it here.

50:12.308 --> 50:14.015
- What was it like?

50:14.310 --> 50:16.153
- What?

50:16.446 --> 50:18.790
- Mexico.
What was Mexico like?

50:19.082 --> 50:22.188
- Well, it wasn't
like anything.

50:22.452 --> 50:24.557
- It was warm and beautiful.

50:27.357 --> 50:29.837
And you were really far away.

50:32.028 --> 50:34.804
See, I was reading
this book...

50:35.098 --> 50:38.568
about Morocco,

50:38.835 --> 50:41.816
and there's sand.

50:42.105 --> 50:45.416
There's warm sand
under your feet.

50:45.675 --> 50:49.555
And sometimes there's thunder,
only it's not scary.

50:52.448 --> 50:55.827
And there's this woman.

50:56.119 --> 50:59.100
And she gets lost.

50:59.355 --> 51:02.234
And when she gets lost,
she can't get back, you know.

51:02.525 --> 51:04.198
- But you can.
See, you can get back.

51:04.494 --> 51:06.030
That's what happened to me.

51:06.329 --> 51:08.866
That's why I met you.

51:09.165 --> 51:12.044
I want a safe place.

51:15.171 --> 51:18.983
- Tell me more about Mexico.

51:19.242 --> 51:22.416
- There's nothing to tell.

51:22.712 --> 51:26.250
- Tell me about the states
you drove through.

51:28.151 --> 51:30.324
- Come here and kiss me,

51:30.587 --> 51:33.067
and I'll tell you.

52:06.456 --> 52:10.165
- Hey, have you seen Sam
this morning?

52:10.460 --> 52:11.939
- No.

52:35.785 --> 52:37.093
. Hey-

52:40.723 --> 52:42.930
. Hey-

52:43.226 --> 52:45.900
- The party was fun.

52:47.296 --> 52:49.902
- <i>Good.</i>

52:55.004 --> 52:57.177
- What are you doing?

53:09.118 --> 53:11.928
- Can I ask you a question?

53:14.023 --> 53:15.127
<i>_ OW?</i>

53:17.927 --> 53:21.033
- Do you think
that it would, like...

53:21.297 --> 53:23.277
scare somebody off

53:23.533 --> 53:26.207
if you, like...

53:26.502 --> 53:31.144
really opened up to them,
like, in bed?

53:31.441 --> 53:35.787
- Thing is...l don't want to go
to the doctor.

53:38.781 --> 53:40.624
- I have to go to the store.

53:57.467 --> 54:01.074
- Amy?
Amy Bear, is that you?

54:01.337 --> 54:03.374
Oh, my God,
I haven't seen you in forever.

54:03.673 --> 54:05.812
- Carrie.
Hi.

54:06.075 --> 54:07.418
You look great.

54:07.710 --> 54:09.189
Are you just in town
visiting your mom?

54:09.479 --> 54:10.958
- Yeah.

54:11.214 --> 54:12.750
I'm actually getting
my master's in early education.

54:13.049 --> 54:15.655
So what are you up to?
You were always creative.

54:15.918 --> 54:17.864
- Nothing.
I'm not doing anything.

54:18.154 --> 54:20.361
I just, um--yeah.

54:20.656 --> 54:23.330
That's great about you, though.
- Nothing?

54:23.593 --> 54:25.038
- Yeah, no, I just--
I don't know.

54:25.328 --> 54:27.831
- Yeah. No, no.
I mean, we have so much time.

54:28.097 --> 54:29.440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:29.732 --> 54:33.111
So how's your family?

54:33.402 --> 54:35.177
- Uh...

54:35.438 --> 54:36.815
they're, um...

54:37.106 --> 54:38.710
- Can I get your basket?

54:39.008 --> 54:41.045
- Okay.
Thank you.

54:44.213 --> 54:46.557
Um, it was nice
to see you, Carrie.

54:46.849 --> 54:49.352
Good luck.
Congrats on everything.

54:54.090 --> 54:56.969
- Look like you're having
a rough time.

54:57.260 --> 54:58.796
- What?
No, I'm fine.

54:59.095 --> 55:01.803
I was just, um...

55:02.098 --> 55:05.272
- It's $15.98.

55:08.471 --> 55:10.178
- Shit.

55:10.473 --> 55:12.350
Shoot, I only have ten.

55:12.642 --> 55:14.121
Um, let me just
put back the bread.

55:14.410 --> 55:16.412
I'll put back the bread,
and then you can re-ring it.

55:16.712 --> 55:19.852
- It's fine.
Get me next time.

55:20.116 --> 55:22.153
- Okay, thank you.

55:22.451 --> 55:24.431
- Hey, uh...

55:24.720 --> 55:25.858
if you ever need to talk,

55:26.122 --> 55:27.897
I talk to your brother
from time to time.

55:28.157 --> 55:32.799
- What?
No, I don't need to talk.

56:20.309 --> 56:22.186
- Hi, Amy.
- Hi, Amy.

56:23.312 --> 56:26.191
- No Sam?

56:26.482 --> 56:28.758
Do you think he left?

56:29.018 --> 56:30.292
- Probably.

56:30.553 --> 56:33.159
I mean, he's not
a moral person, Amy.

56:33.456 --> 56:36.164
- What do I care, right?

56:36.459 --> 56:37.802
- Exactly.

56:38.060 --> 56:39.835
- He was just a pain in the ass.
- Right.

56:40.129 --> 56:42.109
I mean, you could do better.

56:42.365 --> 56:44.208
- I could find a rich man.
- Yeah.

56:44.500 --> 56:45.706
- A rich man!

56:46.002 --> 56:51.179
- Do you think, really?
- I don't know.

56:51.474 --> 56:55.183
- Do you want me to read you
my journal, Amy?

56:57.647 --> 57:00.321
- Why would he stick around here
anyway, huh?

57:00.583 --> 57:03.530
I probably wouldn't like him
if he stayed.

57:07.657 --> 57:11.264
But still, he could have
asked me if I wanted to go.

57:13.095 --> 57:16.702
- You don't want me to be sick,
Amy, do you?

57:16.999 --> 57:18.842
See, that's why I don't want
to go to the doctor,

57:19.101 --> 57:20.944
'cause then you really
get sick.

57:21.237 --> 57:22.614
Remember Nat?

57:22.905 --> 57:24.680
He was just having
a little trouble walking

57:24.941 --> 57:27.717
before he went to the doctor.

57:28.010 --> 57:29.455
And Grandma and Grandpa,

57:29.712 --> 57:32.249
they all die
after they go to the doctor.

57:32.548 --> 57:34.425
- Tell her to--she's giving me
a frickin' headache.

57:34.717 --> 57:36.594
Tell her to shut up.

57:36.886 --> 57:41.562
I'm gonna cook in a bit, okay?

57:41.857 --> 57:43.803
Okay-

57:44.060 --> 57:45.437
- I could cook.

57:46.896 --> 57:48.773
I don't know
how to make anything,

57:49.065 --> 57:50.874
but I could cook.

57:51.133 --> 57:54.273
- No, it's okay.
I just have to pee.

57:54.570 --> 57:56.880
I just have to pee.

57:57.139 --> 57:59.619
I just have
to pee.

58:27.803 --> 58:30.147
- Hey, guys-

58:32.575 --> 58:34.612
What's going on?

58:34.910 --> 58:36.856
- Amy. I--

58:37.113 --> 58:38.615
- What's she doing?

58:38.914 --> 58:40.416
- Someone should go in there.

58:40.683 --> 58:43.220
- Probably you.

58:43.519 --> 58:45.123
- She's in the bathroom?

58:45.421 --> 58:48.368
- Oh, my God.
What if we have to pee?

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:07.979
- Here.

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:09.374
Here, I'll do it.

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:11.208
- No, I can do it.

01:00:19.448 --> 01:00:23.726
You couldn't go in there, huh?

01:00:24.019 --> 01:00:26.363
You know
this is all your fault.

01:00:26.622 --> 01:00:28.397
You should just go.

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:31.729
- Look, I'm gonna
make things better, okay?

01:00:32.027 --> 01:00:35.406
Yeah, right.

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:39.669
- How do you--how do you do
this freakin' coffee-

01:00:39.935 --> 01:00:43.212
Oh, I got it.

01:00:47.743 --> 01:00:48.915
- No Amy?

01:00:49.211 --> 01:00:50.417
- No.

01:01:36.825 --> 01:01:40.034
<i>- Motrin' .</i>

01:01:47.269 --> 01:01:50.307
- I thought--
- Are you okay, Amy?

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:54.418
- Making breakfast.

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:56.884
- Have you been home
all night?

01:01:57.179 --> 01:02:00.183
- Yeah, since maybe
a little after dinner.

01:02:00.482 --> 01:02:03.622
Where were you last night?

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:07.026
- Where was I?

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:09.997
Where were you yesterday?

01:02:10.292 --> 01:02:13.637
- Oh, I took that
construction job, $9 an hour.

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:16.843
Built a roof.

01:02:17.132 --> 01:02:19.669
- On.

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:24.284
Lucy, you should make yourself
that doctor's appointment, okay?

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:27.680
<i>_ OW?</i>

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:30.958
- Where's your stuff?

01:02:31.213 --> 01:02:32.692
- I cleaned up.

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:34.791
I put the rest of my stuff
on the top shelf of your closet.

01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:37.553
I hope that's okay.

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.827
- Here, let me do that.
You're making a mess.

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:45.800
- No.

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:47.631
Here, let me help you.
I got that.

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:50.137
Sorry, I didn't--

01:02:56.438 --> 01:02:59.112
- Um...

01:03:02.511 --> 01:03:05.981
so you were all here
last night...

01:03:07.916 --> 01:03:09.293
and you didn't...

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:10.723
- I didn't-didn't what?

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.557
- I just need to get out here.

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:15.631
- What are you talking
about, Amy?

01:03:15.891 --> 01:03:19.168
- I've got
a doctor's appointment.

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:22.136
- Good. Oh, good.
Good girl.

01:03:25.367 --> 01:03:27.904
- I got a gift for ya, Amy.
- Shove it up your ass, Sam!

01:03:28.203 --> 01:03:29.705
- No, let me explain.
- No, just shove it, okay?

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:31.110
Just shove it.
Just shove it!

01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:34.411
- I told you
you should have gone in!

01:03:37.746 --> 01:03:38.952
- What?

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:40.226
- I just want to give you
this gift.

01:03:40.482 --> 01:03:41.620
- I'm not safe enough?

01:03:41.917 --> 01:03:43.897
Is that it, Sam?
I'm not safe enough?

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:45.689
You fucking pussy.
- No, no, no, no.

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.467
Just calm down, Amy.
- Fuck you! Is that it?

01:03:47.756 --> 01:03:51.602
- Calm the fuck down!
Okay?

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:55.273
Now, I want to take you out
somewhere special tonight, okay?

01:03:55.564 --> 01:03:57.566
Just you and me.
Is that okay?

01:04:02.771 --> 01:04:04.751
Okay-

01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:24.698
I want to do something,
you and me.

01:04:26.962 --> 01:04:28.999
- Oh?

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:30.572
- Yeah.

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:36.240
- I don't know.

01:04:36.538 --> 01:04:39.075
- You don't?
- What about them?

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:43.152
- Well, I think this would be
really good for them.

01:04:43.445 --> 01:04:47.222
- I don't know.
They might die without me.

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:49.292
- What do you mean
without you?

01:04:49.551 --> 01:04:51.258
- I just don't know
if I'd be able

01:04:51.553 --> 01:04:54.500
to stop thinking about them.

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:57.600
- What? No.

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.567
You see,
they'd have both of us--

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:01.136
you and me.

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:04.037
I'd be really good to them.

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:06.142
I want a family.

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:10.009
I didn't know before, but that's
what I've been looking for.

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.817
- Family?
What?

01:05:23.886 --> 01:05:26.230
- Go on.
Just reach in there.

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:30.464
- Ha.

01:05:37.499 --> 01:05:39.501
It's a little thing,
but I'll get you a better one

01:05:39.768 --> 01:05:41.975
when I get the money.

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:52.392
What?

01:05:52.681 --> 01:05:56.288
What do you think?

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:59.761
Will you marry me?

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:23.313
- Where's Amy?

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:24.989
- Oh, we're gonna meet her
and Nat for dinner

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.816
after the doctor.

01:06:27.115 --> 01:06:28.822
- I told you I'm not going
to the doctor without Amy.

01:06:29.117 --> 01:06:31.927
- Too bad.
- You're not my father.

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:34.064
- No, I'm not your father...

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:36.963
but she didn't say, "no.“
She said, "I don't know."

01:06:37.259 --> 01:06:39.739
So I could be your fuckin'
father any day now, okay?

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:41.338
And even though
I'm not your fuckin' father,

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.166
I'm still taking you
to the fuckin' doctor.

01:06:43.465 --> 01:06:46.309
'Cause I'm an idiot!
I'm a fuckin' idiot!

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:51.108
Get in the car.
- Jesus. Calm down.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:18.742
- Why you got that?

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:20.981
- Sam asked me to mam! him.

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:24.878
- On.

01:07:25.173 --> 01:07:26.709
- What do you think?

01:07:30.445 --> 01:07:34.291
- It looks good.
It's pretty.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.928
- About me getting married.

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:41.627
- You want to?

01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:45.394
- This dress was Mom's.

01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:50.309
- What was she like?

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:52.409
What did she look like?

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:55.807
- Pretty.
Brown hair.

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:58.915
- What's love like?

01:07:59.207 --> 01:08:01.380
- It's wonderful.

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:07.087
But it doesn't make
everything wonderful.

01:08:07.382 --> 01:08:11.421
It doesn't make
the parts of you that want,

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.666
that wonder go away.

01:08:19.394 --> 01:08:21.897
- I wish I could feel it.

01:08:22.197 --> 01:08:25.474
- You're in love with me,
aren't you?

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:29.341
- Well, yeah,
but that's different.

01:08:29.604 --> 01:08:33.109
- Mm-mm.
No.

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.920
It's exactly the same thing.

01:09:11.712 --> 01:09:13.020
- What happened?

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:49.154
- The doctor says
you do this to yourself?

01:09:52.453 --> 01:09:54.400
Why do you do that?

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:02.642
- Shit.

01:10:02.931 --> 01:10:04.137
<i>He'!-</i>

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:06.743
Hey, it's cool.

01:10:08.837 --> 01:10:10.783
Don't cry.

01:10:11.039 --> 01:10:15.545
Hey, it's gonna be okay,
all right?

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:29.633
Hey, everything's
gonna be fine, all right?

01:10:35.697 --> 01:10:38.507
It's okay.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.007
You're gonna be all right.

01:10:41.303 --> 01:10:43.146
Okay?

01:10:57.352 --> 01:10:59.628
- Hey, Sam?
- Yeah?

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:03.700
- Could we just
not tell Amy just yet?

01:11:03.992 --> 01:11:06.302
I mean, maybe you could just
talk to the doctor,

01:11:06.561 --> 01:11:08.199
and he could tell you
what I have to do,

01:11:08.497 --> 01:11:10.704
and you could tell me.

01:11:10.999 --> 01:11:13.343
<i>_ OW?</i>

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:17.072
- Thanks.
- Sure.

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:26.892
- Hey. Hi.

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:30.891
- Hey.
- What happened?

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:33.496
- He says
everything's gonna be okay.

01:12:34.482 --> 01:12:37.326
- Sam.

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.796
Sam.

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.372
Sam.

01:12:48.663 --> 01:12:50.506
- Hmm?
- Sam.

01:12:54.035 --> 01:12:56.037
I need to talk to you.

01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:59.842
_ Now?

01:13:00.141 --> 01:13:02.348
- I don't think I can do it.

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:04.988
- What?

01:13:06.481 --> 01:13:08.688
- Marry--get married.

01:13:14.856 --> 01:13:17.359
- Are you mad?

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:19.161
Where are you going?

01:13:19.461 --> 01:13:21.304
- I'm not gonna stick
around here.

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:23.565
- Well, I'm not saying
that I want you to leave.

01:13:23.865 --> 01:13:26.505
- What are you saying, then?

01:13:26.801 --> 01:13:31.272
- I just don't--I can't--
I don't want to say forever.

01:13:31.539 --> 01:13:35.419
I need to be able to imagine
something else for myself.

01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:39.157
- Well, then that's
what you want.

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:40.722
- That night when I cried,

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:43.155
you heard,
and you couldn't come in, right?

01:13:43.418 --> 01:13:45.728
You couldn't come in.
You can't take me away.

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:47.364
You want a family.

01:13:47.656 --> 01:13:49.363
- Look, I'm sorry
about that, Amy-.

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:51.831
That was--
Look, I messed up, okay?

01:13:52.093 --> 01:13:53.367
But I can learn.

01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:55.300
I can learn what to do
if you cry.

01:13:55.563 --> 01:13:58.407
- And you'll be happy stuck in
this house, day in and day out?

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.839
- Yes, I will.

01:14:03.004 --> 01:14:05.382
- Did you really go
to Mexico, Sam?

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.847
- You don't know
about the road, Amy.

01:14:08.109 --> 01:14:10.316
- Where are the keys
to your car?

01:14:12.013 --> 01:14:14.789
- On the dresser.

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:17.860
- I don't know about the road?
- No.

01:14:18.119 --> 01:14:19.792
- But I could.
Why not me, huh?

01:14:20.088 --> 01:14:22.227
I could take these keys.
I could go.

01:14:22.524 --> 01:14:23.832
I could go.
Why not me?

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:26.072
- Go ahead, take 'em!
- Fine! I will!

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:27.999
'Cause you ever think
about it, Sam, who I'd be

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:30.368
if I didn't have all this shit,
who else I'd be?

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:32.509
- You wouldn't be anyone.

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:52.288
- Can I buy you a drink?

01:15:54.449 --> 01:15:57.055
- Sure.

01:16:00.955 --> 01:16:03.094
- The thing that's hard
about selling these respirators

01:16:03.358 --> 01:16:07.500
is that you have to go
into hospitals,

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:10.834
and you can get sick.

01:16:11.132 --> 01:16:12.406
- That sounds terrible.

01:16:12.667 --> 01:16:14.340
- But I'm not.

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:17.480
Sick, I mean.
Not now.

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.446
I mean, if we were to,

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:23.120
you know,
I wouldn't give ya a disease.

01:16:23.411 --> 01:16:24.754
- I got to go-

01:16:25.046 --> 01:16:26.389
- Oh, hey, where you headed?

01:16:26.681 --> 01:16:27.989
- I don't--I don't know.

01:16:28.249 --> 01:16:30.695
It was good to meet you.
Good luck with your respirators.

01:16:30.985 --> 01:16:32.362
- Oh, here, let me help you.

01:16:32.654 --> 01:16:33.689
- No, I'm good.
Thank you.

01:16:33.988 --> 01:16:35.968
- Oh, hey, come on!

01:16:37.692 --> 01:16:39.672
Oh, hey, hey, hey, you know,
you shouldn't drive.

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:41.134
You're drunk.

01:16:41.429 --> 01:16:42.772
- I'm good.
Thank you.

01:16:43.064 --> 01:16:44.270
- I got a place to stay
if you need someplace to go.

01:16:44.566 --> 01:16:45.840
- No, I'm gonna go.

01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:47.444
- Well, hey, I thought
we were getting along.

01:16:47.735 --> 01:16:50.841
- No, we were.
I'm just really tired.

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:52.881
- Well, then don't drive.

01:16:53.174 --> 01:16:54.551
You having trouble
with the key?

01:16:54.843 --> 01:16:56.049
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.

01:16:56.344 --> 01:16:58.824
- Oh, hey, what the fuck?

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.889
Bitch!

01:18:56.364 --> 01:18:58.844
- You look beautiful.

01:19:00.034 --> 01:19:02.674
- Wow.
You do look beautiful.

01:19:09.677 --> 01:19:12.521
- Are ya cookin'?
- Yeah.

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:14.657
- You making a mess?

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:17.419
- I'll get better at it.

01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:19.596
- I'll do it.

01:19:24.325 --> 01:19:26.464
- Here.

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:40.178
- Hey, Amy,
what's it gonna be like

01:19:40.441 --> 01:19:41.749
when you guys get married?

01:19:46.247 --> 01:19:49.694
- It'll be the same...

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:53.262
except, um,
there'll be two of us.

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:58.897
We'll take you for your walk.

01:19:59.193 --> 01:20:00.467
We'll eat.

01:20:00.728 --> 01:20:03.572
You'll watch TV.

01:20:03.865 --> 01:20:06.038
Sam will have a beer.

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:09.145
Lucy will dance.

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:11.439
I'll read.

01:20:11.739 --> 01:20:15.118
And we'll go to the doctor again
and again if we have to.

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:17.890
We'll deal.

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:21.684
We'll go on.

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:24.759
We'll keep going...

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:26.760
together...

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:29.729
because we are a family.

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:31.595
We are a family.

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:37.934
I wanted to go there

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:43.809
I wanted to see

01:20:46.407 --> 01:20:49.581
I wanted to open

01:20:51.779 --> 01:20:55.921
I wanted to be

01:20:59.687 --> 01:21:03.658
I wanted to listen

01:21:05.927 --> 01:21:09.534
I wanted to sound

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:15.709
And I wanted to miss him

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:23.846
I want to be found

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:28.892
I wanted to be there

01:21:32.019 --> 01:21:36.058
I wanted to find

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:41.867
I wanted to be there

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:52.175
I wanted to go there
by your side

01:22:16.764 --> 01:22:22.908
I know that you loved him

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:27.084
I know that you tried

01:22:29.744 --> 01:22:33.351
I know that you whispered

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:41.994
And I know that you cried

01:22:42.256 --> 01:22:48.366
And I know
that you've gone now

01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:53.578
And I know it's all right

01:22:55.770 --> 01:23:01.413
But it won't be long now

01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:07.990
Until we're back in time

01:23:08.249 --> 01:23:12.789
I wanted to be there

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:19.395
I wanted to find

01:23:21.128 --> 01:23:25.975
And I wanted to be fair

01:23:27.435 --> 01:23:33.613
And I wanted to go there
by your side

01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:38.220
I wanted to be there

01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:44.856
I wanted to find

01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:51.631
I wanted to tell you

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:58.238
I wanted
to tell you

01:23:58.533 --> 01:24:03.642
Good-bye
