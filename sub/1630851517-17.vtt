00:02.001 --> 00:03.503
<i>Previously on</i>
Young Sheldon...

00:03.570 --> 00:04.504
It's fun, huh?

00:04.571 --> 00:06.039
{\an1}I feel like I'm riding
in a banana.

00:06.106 --> 00:08.108
So excited for you to show me
around campus today.

00:08.173 --> 00:10.143
Come on. Let's go.

00:10.210 --> 00:11.177
Together again.

00:11.244 --> 00:12.579
Just feels right, doesn't it?

00:12.645 --> 00:13.580
{\an1}(groans)

00:13.646 --> 00:17.150
I'm actually... 29.

00:17.217 --> 00:20.086
Well, I guess there's something
I should tell you.

00:20.153 --> 00:22.355
I'm totally fine with that.

00:22.422 --> 00:25.191
{\an3}I was talking about us
travelling together,

00:25.258 --> 00:28.094
and instead, you went out
and bought a yellow clown car.

00:28.161 --> 00:30.597
{\an1}You're picturing a future
where we slow down,

00:30.663 --> 00:33.266
and I'm just getting going.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.135
You know I love you, right?

00:35.201 --> 00:36.469
I love you, too.

00:36.536 --> 00:39.205
But we're done.

00:42.142 --> 00:44.144
{\an8}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>For many college kids,</i>

00:44.210 --> 00:47.580
{\an8}<i>waiting in line for concert</i>
<i>tickets is a rite of passage,</i>

00:47.647 --> 00:49.282
{\an8}<i>and I was no different.</i>

00:49.349 --> 00:52.185
{\an8}<i>Except, instead</i>
<i>of rock and roll music,</i>

00:52.252 --> 00:54.154
{\an8}<i>my concert was a lecture</i>

00:54.220 --> 00:55.622
{\an8}<i>on black hole topology.</i>

00:55.688 --> 00:58.091
<i>Instead of a stage dive,</i>

00:58.158 --> 01:00.326
<i>I would dive into knowledge.</i>

01:00.393 --> 01:02.695
<i>Instead of</i>
<i>guitar-shredding solos,</i>

01:02.762 --> 01:06.232
<i>I would witness</i>
<i>universe-shredding hypotheses.</i>

01:06.299 --> 01:07.700
<i>And instead of a charismatic</i>

01:07.767 --> 01:11.304
<i>front man dazzling the audience,</i>
<i>there would be...</i>

01:11.371 --> 01:13.173
(speaking indistinctly)

01:13.239 --> 01:14.707
<i>...well, actually,</i>
<i>the exact same thing.</i>

01:14.774 --> 01:16.209
{\an3}Sheldon?

01:16.276 --> 01:18.678
{\an1}Paige?
Why are you here?

01:18.745 --> 01:19.913
The lecture.

01:19.979 --> 01:23.149
{\an7}Well, if you're looking to jump
the line, I don't do cutsies.

01:23.216 --> 01:25.118
{\an8}No, I'm actually
part of the lecture.

01:25.185 --> 01:27.253
{\an8}Professor Patterson
is my mentor at U.T.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.190
{\an7}Really? You're part
of the quantum gravity team?

01:30.256 --> 01:31.291
{\an8}Yeah, it's actually
really interesting.

01:31.357 --> 01:32.358
{\an8}We've been examining all...

01:31.357 --> 01:32.358
{\an8}I know what it's about.

01:32.425 --> 01:35.528
{\an8}It's why I've been waiting
in line for three hours.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.264
Wow, three hours
to see me speak?

01:38.331 --> 01:40.166
I didn't know
you were such a fan.

01:42.202 --> 01:45.104

01:45.171 --> 01:47.574

02:01.354 --> 02:04.424
{\an8}Okay, this is it.

02:04.491 --> 02:05.725
{\an8}Nice.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.293
{\an8}Not really,

02:07.360 --> 02:09.562
{\an8}but at least my parents
aren't in the room next door.

02:09.628 --> 02:12.432
{\an7}Oh, you want me to move this
to the bedroom?

02:12.499 --> 02:14.634
{\an8}It's a studio,
this is the bedroom.

02:14.701 --> 02:16.202
{\an8}Oh.

02:17.537 --> 02:18.571
{\an8}There you go.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.273
{\an8}How can I ever thank you?

02:20.340 --> 02:21.441
{\an8}Let's see...

02:21.508 --> 02:23.142
{\an7}we are
in the bedroom.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.612
{\an9}What, so, like,
take a nap?

02:25.678 --> 02:27.380
{\an7}(chuckles)
Maybe after.

02:27.447 --> 02:28.515
{\an9}Deal.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.586
{\an8}(door opens, closes)

02:31.351 --> 02:33.586
{\an8}MISSY: I'm home.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.588
{\an7}Hey, honey,
how was school?

02:35.655 --> 02:37.524
{\an9}So good. Meemaw picked me up
in her new car.

02:37.590 --> 02:40.159
{\an8}We drove with the top down.

02:40.226 --> 02:42.462
{\an8}A truck driver honked at us.
(chuckles)

02:42.529 --> 02:44.264
{\an8}It was awesome.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.432
{\an8}See? Missy loves my car.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.601
{\an8}I don't know what
Dale's problem is.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.236
{\an8}You're too good for him anyway.

02:50.303 --> 02:52.672
{\an8}Should she really
be hearing about all this?

02:52.739 --> 02:54.541
{\an8}Mom, she just got dumped.

02:54.607 --> 02:55.775
{\an8}It's what you do.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.611
{\an8}Ooh, is any of his stuff
at your house?

02:58.678 --> 03:00.313
{\an8}Let's set it on fire.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.614
{\an8}Don't you have homework?

03:01.681 --> 03:04.217
{\an8}My grandma's hurting.
She needs me.

03:04.284 --> 03:06.286
{\an7}Go.

03:04.284 --> 03:06.286
{\an9}(sighs)

03:06.352 --> 03:07.654
{\an8}I appreciate you
picking Missy up

03:07.720 --> 03:09.722
{\an8}from school,
but she does not need to hear

03:09.789 --> 03:11.324
{\an8}about your love life.

03:11.391 --> 03:12.659
{\an8}She's got to learn sometime.

03:12.725 --> 03:14.294
{\an8}Learn what?

03:14.360 --> 03:15.328
{\an8}That men suck.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.330
{\an8}Not all men... do that.

03:17.397 --> 03:21.334
{\an8}Suck. Say it.

03:21.401 --> 03:23.269
{\an7}No.

03:21.401 --> 03:23.269
{\an8}I want Missy back.

03:23.336 --> 03:26.806
{\an8}Oh, I know that
you're hurting, and...

03:26.873 --> 03:29.309
{\an8}I'm here for you, so...

03:29.375 --> 03:30.243
{\an8}what do you need?

03:30.310 --> 03:32.278
{\an8}Great, take me drinking.

03:32.345 --> 03:35.281
{\an8}It is 3:30 in the afternoon.

03:35.348 --> 03:37.817
{\an9}Yes, it's called
happy hour.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.752
{\an8}I have to make dinner.

03:39.819 --> 03:43.389
{\an8}Oh, fine. I'll just be sad
and drunk by myself.

03:43.456 --> 03:46.259
Maybe I'll go home
with the bartender.

03:48.294 --> 03:49.696
Missy!

03:49.762 --> 03:51.998
I have to go out
with your meemaw,

03:52.065 --> 03:54.233
{\an3}but I'll be back later
with KFC.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.705
Did you see that
ridiculous car she bought?

03:58.771 --> 04:01.374
Nope, but I sure have heard
a lot about it.

04:01.441 --> 04:02.175
What is her problem?

04:02.241 --> 04:04.310
{\an1}She think she can do
better than me?

04:04.377 --> 04:05.445
{\an3}Don't know
what she thinks.

04:05.511 --> 04:08.181
{\an5}I'm a catch.

04:05.511 --> 04:08.181
Okay.

04:09.315 --> 04:10.717
You don't think I'm a catch?

04:10.783 --> 04:13.319
{\an3}You're a catch.
You're very catchable.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.288
Darn tootin'.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.257
I thought you ended things
with her.

04:18.324 --> 04:21.394
Yeah, not my fault
she's okay with it.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.731
You know what's better
than going on and on about it?

04:24.797 --> 04:26.466
What's that?

04:26.532 --> 04:28.334
(grunting)

04:28.401 --> 04:30.470
{\an3}Come on, you can do better
than that. Punch her new car.

04:30.536 --> 04:31.738
{\an1}(grunting)

04:31.804 --> 04:33.306
Don't forget
it's yellow.

04:33.373 --> 04:35.274
{\an1}I mean, since when
are cars yellow?

04:35.341 --> 04:36.309
It's not a taxi.

04:36.376 --> 04:38.011
Less talking,
more punching.

04:38.077 --> 04:40.947
{\an1}Can I at least have some gloves?
My hands hurt.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.316
{\an3}Well, aren't you
a tender buttercup.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.385
Watch this.

04:46.352 --> 04:47.520
<i>(knocks on door)</i>

04:49.422 --> 04:50.757
Oh, hello.

04:50.823 --> 04:52.291
You didn't stay for the Q and A.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.927
I had no Q's,
and therefore, needed no A's.

04:54.994 --> 04:57.497
Well, I thought that maybe
we could just hang out.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.298
Why would we do that?

04:59.365 --> 05:00.333
'Cause we're friends.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.036
Are we? One time,
you punched me in the face.

05:03.102 --> 05:05.838
Yeah, that's what friends do.
Can I come in?

05:05.905 --> 05:08.441
Why aren't you spending the
afternoon with your colleagues?

05:08.508 --> 05:11.778
Well, Professor Patterson
took the team out for drinks.

05:11.844 --> 05:13.413
That kind of
leaves me on my own.

05:13.479 --> 05:14.981
Fine, come in.

05:16.582 --> 05:17.850
You got a roommate?

05:17.917 --> 05:19.452
No, it's a single.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.888
I have a chaperone. Mona.

05:21.954 --> 05:23.790
She's, like, 30. It's the worst.

05:23.856 --> 05:25.425
Why do you need a chaperone?

05:25.491 --> 05:27.927
Maybe they think I'm, like,
some kind of troublemaker.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.396
{\an3}As the owner of the face
you punched, they're right.

05:30.463 --> 05:31.464
(knock on door)

05:31.531 --> 05:32.965
Yo, homie. Oh.

05:33.032 --> 05:34.467
Sorry, didn't know
you had company.

05:34.534 --> 05:37.403
{\an1}Oh, this is Paige.
Paige, this is Darren.

05:37.470 --> 05:38.838
{\an5}He lives next door.

05:37.470 --> 05:38.838
{\an3}Hi.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.339
We're having a <i> Mario Kart</i>
death match.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.340
You guys want in?

05:41.407 --> 05:42.575
It's pretty fun.

05:42.642 --> 05:44.077
{\an1}We do it a few times
a week.

05:44.143 --> 05:45.945
{\an3}Really?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.447
You want to join us?

05:47.513 --> 05:50.016
{\an3}Uh... I've never
played before.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.118
Perfect, you can be
on Oscar's team.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.053
I will destroy.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.091
{\an3}Your neighbors let you
hang out with them?

05:58.157 --> 06:01.394
{\an1}I'm basically the social glue
of our floor.

06:06.566 --> 06:09.102
{\an1}(gasps) Oh, God,
is that my yearbook?

06:09.168 --> 06:10.970
Dang, y'all had some big hair.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.905
You're gonna talk to me
about big hair?

06:12.972 --> 06:15.408
You think it's big now,
wait till it gets humid.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.844
Okay, so, uh,

06:17.910 --> 06:19.579
{\an1}when do I get to see
your yearbook?

06:22.448 --> 06:24.984
{\an3}Actually...

06:25.051 --> 06:27.386
{\an3}I dropped out
my senior year.

06:28.621 --> 06:29.989
{\an1}Oh.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.391
{\an3}I'm sorry for not
telling you sooner.

06:33.659 --> 06:35.461
No, it's okay.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.063
{\an3}Yeah?

06:37.130 --> 06:39.031
{\an1}Yeah.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.502
{\an1}So what other secrets
are you hiding from me?

06:42.568 --> 06:43.936
{\an1}You got a wife
and kids?

06:44.003 --> 06:45.605
{\an3}No.

06:48.674 --> 06:52.011
{\an3}But I'm not really 21.
I'm 17.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.080
{\an1}(laughing)

06:56.949 --> 06:57.950
What the...

07:02.622 --> 07:03.623
{\an1}Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

07:03.689 --> 07:05.024
{\an3}It ain't that big
of a deal.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.559
I just slept
with a 17-year-old.

07:06.626 --> 07:07.560
If you were a guy,

07:07.627 --> 07:08.528
you'd think that was cool.

07:08.594 --> 07:11.564
I can't believe you lied to me.

07:11.631 --> 07:12.799
Only 'cause I like you.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.734
Get out.

07:14.801 --> 07:17.737
Come on, I'm the same guy
I was five minutes ago.

07:17.804 --> 07:19.539
Yeah, a liar.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.541
You lied to me about your age.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.509
Yeah, and then I felt
really bad about it,

07:23.576 --> 07:24.877
and I told you the truth.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.580
'Cause you're
more mature than me.

07:28.614 --> 07:29.549
Go.

07:29.615 --> 07:30.950
{\an3}Can I at least
put on my shoes?

07:31.017 --> 07:32.819
{\an1}No.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.823
(door opens, slams closed)

07:36.889 --> 07:38.624
Where do you go?

07:38.691 --> 07:40.626
{\an3}U.T.

07:38.691 --> 07:40.626
{\an1}Austin,

07:40.693 --> 07:42.895
great city. You must have fun.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.631
Yeah. It's one big party.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.633
So, did you guys get,
like, assigned

07:47.700 --> 07:49.569
to look after Sheldon
or something?

07:49.635 --> 07:51.604
{\an3}No, he ended up
in the room next door.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.539
So we took him in, like a dog.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.610
Him being so young
isn't, like, weird?

07:57.677 --> 07:58.845
I'm basically 50.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.980
And we're basically 12,
so it all works out.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.248
(chuckles)

08:02.315 --> 08:03.115
You good for D&amp;D on Friday?

08:03.182 --> 08:05.251
It's the only day
Abby can make it.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.419
There's an Abby?

08:06.485 --> 08:08.988
{\an1}She only likes them as a friend.
She made that very clear.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.690
So clear.

08:10.756 --> 08:11.891
Do you play D&amp;D?

08:12.992 --> 08:15.862
No. I actually just
sit in my dorm room and study

08:15.928 --> 08:17.597
because I have no friends.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.665
That's a bummer.

08:19.732 --> 08:20.800
{\an3}Yeah.

08:22.802 --> 08:24.604
{\an3}I think
I'm gonna go.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.938
Bye.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.673
(door opens)

08:27.740 --> 08:28.941
(door closes)

08:29.008 --> 08:30.643
{\an1}You should
go after her.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.578
Why? She's a bummer,
you just said so.

08:37.717 --> 08:38.683
Here you go.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.620
{\an1}I'm still working
on this one.

08:40.686 --> 08:41.621
{\an3}Oh, dear.

08:41.687 --> 08:42.788
Well, I'm sure

08:42.855 --> 08:44.624
{\an3}someone here
will drink it.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.025
{\an3}(chuckles)

08:46.092 --> 08:49.295
You keep saying you're okay.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.529
Are you?

08:50.596 --> 08:51.697
I'm better than okay.

08:51.764 --> 08:54.033
Great. Glad to hear it.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.836
You know what it's like?

08:56.903 --> 08:58.871
You see these peanuts?

08:58.938 --> 09:01.607
{\an1}Two of them stuck together
in the shell.

09:01.674 --> 09:03.142
{\an3}Trapped.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.712
{\an3}And then, you look here
at this one,

09:06.779 --> 09:09.315
all on its own.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.317
{\an3}Solo.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.319
{\an3}Happy.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.855
So, you're a solo peanut?

09:15.922 --> 09:17.056
Mm, damn straight.

09:17.123 --> 09:20.326
As a matter of fact...

09:20.393 --> 09:22.028
Enjoy your freedom.

09:22.094 --> 09:24.764
Well, if you're happy,
I'm happy.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.999
I am.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.568
Maybe not as happy as this

09:29.635 --> 09:30.736
threesome going on here.

09:30.803 --> 09:32.104
{\an5}Mom.

09:30.803 --> 09:32.104
{\an3}(chuckles)

09:34.740 --> 09:36.776
(door opens, closes)

09:36.842 --> 09:38.678
{\an6}SHELDON:
Can you settle
an argument?

09:38.744 --> 09:41.614
{\an3}I said you're fine. Darren
and Oscar said you're not fine.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.350
Why wouldn't I be fine?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.551
I'm completely alone,
and the one person

09:45.618 --> 09:48.621
I thought would understand
is having the time of his life.

09:48.688 --> 09:51.691
So... just to clarify...?

09:51.757 --> 09:53.759
{\an5}They're right, you're wrong.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.759
Dang it.

09:53.826 --> 09:55.695
How do you have
more friends than me?

09:55.761 --> 09:58.064
I don't know.
I don't even want them.

09:58.130 --> 10:01.667
I thought that college was gonna
be this amazing experience,

10:01.734 --> 10:02.501
but I hate it.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.103
You're doing
such interesting work

10:04.170 --> 10:05.771
with Professor Patterson.

10:05.838 --> 10:07.139
{\an1}What, you really think
he wants

10:07.206 --> 10:08.841
{\an1}to take suggestions
from me?

10:08.908 --> 10:10.876
I'm not even a woman in science.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.979
I'm a little girl in science.

10:13.045 --> 10:15.815
They just trot me out like the
novelty act to help get funding.

10:15.881 --> 10:17.783
They did that to me here, too.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.719
They did?

10:19.785 --> 10:22.388
Yes, and I was very rude
to the donor.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.791
(chuckles) You're kidding.
What happened?

10:25.858 --> 10:27.927
He appreciated my honesty, gave
the school a bunch of money.

10:27.994 --> 10:29.962
Of course he did.

10:30.029 --> 10:31.697
I got to go.

10:31.764 --> 10:32.932
Mona's probably freaking out

10:32.999 --> 10:35.134
because instead of friends,
I have a Mona.

10:36.769 --> 10:38.104
{\an5}(door opens, closes)

10:36.769 --> 10:38.104
Bye.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.416
Oh, for God's sake,

10:50.483 --> 10:51.784
take off that
stupid Ballard shirt.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.285
Oh, look, Connie's here.

10:53.352 --> 10:55.087
(sighs) She's upset about Dale.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.157
I ain't upset about jack squat.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.726
Let's just eat.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.194
Without praying?

11:02.261 --> 11:03.929
(chuckles)

11:03.996 --> 11:05.197
How silly of me.

11:05.264 --> 11:07.266
You all right?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.869
Well, she's had a whole beer,
so who knows.

11:09.935 --> 11:12.338
{\an6}Mother.

11:09.935 --> 11:12.338
Can we just pray?

11:12.405 --> 11:13.372
{\an3}(sighs)

11:13.439 --> 11:15.808
{\an1}Bless us Lord for the food
we are about to receive

11:15.875 --> 11:18.010
and bless the hands
that prepared it.

11:18.077 --> 11:21.013
And forgive me for that beer.
My mother made me do it. Amen.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.181
Snitch.

11:22.248 --> 11:23.883
And by the way,

11:23.949 --> 11:27.086
you can tell your friend Dale
that I want my stuff back.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.021
{\an1}I'm not getting
in the middle of this.

11:29.088 --> 11:31.390
{\an3}'Cause I left my purple bra
over at his place.

11:31.457 --> 11:32.758
I want a purple bra.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.160
{\an4}Oh, Lord.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.160
And if I'm gonna

11:34.226 --> 11:36.128
start dating again,

11:36.195 --> 11:37.430
I'm gonna need that.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.198
Somebody else
needs to talk.

11:39.265 --> 11:41.367
Did you know that Leonard Nimoy
takes pictures of...

11:41.434 --> 11:42.468
{\an3}Georgie?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.170
{\an5}What?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.170
Surprised you're here.

11:44.236 --> 11:45.905
{\an3}Figured you'd be out
with your little girlfriend.

11:45.971 --> 11:47.239
Well, I'm not.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.240
{\an1}Uh-oh.

11:48.307 --> 11:49.708
Did somebody find out

11:49.775 --> 11:50.910
how old you are?

11:50.976 --> 11:52.244
{\an3}Ooh, what does
that mean?

11:52.311 --> 11:54.113
I don't want to
talk about it.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.715
What it means is,
your brother over here

11:56.782 --> 11:58.284
has been going out
with an older woman

11:58.350 --> 12:00.186
and lying about his age.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.787
{\an1}Georgie.

12:01.854 --> 12:02.955
It don't matter.

12:03.022 --> 12:04.390
I told her the truth,
and she dumped me.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.126
{\an3}I can relate.
A young lady brought chaos

12:07.193 --> 12:08.794
{\an3}into my life
as well today.

12:08.861 --> 12:10.796
{\an5}What happened?

12:08.861 --> 12:10.796
SHELDON: Paige was visiting

12:10.863 --> 12:12.498
the university and got mad
that I have college friends

12:12.565 --> 12:13.799
and she doesn't.

12:13.866 --> 12:17.036
You're drunk,
Sheldon has friends.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.437
This a crazy-ass dinner.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.482
Georgie ain't here.

12:29.548 --> 12:30.816
I came to talk to you.

12:30.883 --> 12:31.951
Could you please take your voice

12:32.017 --> 12:33.219
down just a notch?

12:33.285 --> 12:34.520
{\an1}Why? You don't want
anyone to hear?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.088
{\an3}No, I'm a little
hungover.

12:36.155 --> 12:38.124
(rattles loudly)

12:38.190 --> 12:40.126
How could you not tell me
he was 17?

12:40.192 --> 12:43.129
{\an3}Look, I did tell him to tell you
before things went too far.

12:43.195 --> 12:44.897
{\an1}Well, they did go
too far.

12:44.964 --> 12:46.132
{\an3}Well, I get it.
Men are the worst.

12:46.198 --> 12:47.833
{\an3}I'm going through
stuff myself.

12:47.900 --> 12:51.270
{\an4}We are not bonding
over this.

12:47.900 --> 12:51.270
Listen. Just calm down.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.072
Don't tell me
to calm down!

12:54.840 --> 12:56.509
{\an1}And good luck
with your hangover.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.310
(clangs loudly)

13:02.515 --> 13:04.283
Well, that's too bad.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.285
I liked her.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.154
{\an1}Did you see Connie
last night?

13:08.220 --> 13:10.256
Yeah, at dinner.

13:10.322 --> 13:13.325
She say anything about me?

13:13.392 --> 13:15.294
Please leave me out of this.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.963
Oh, come on,
we're friends, George,

13:18.030 --> 13:19.331
and I'm your boss.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.802
She said she wants her bra back.

13:25.271 --> 13:27.573
Uh, the purple one
that opens in the front?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.008
Really don't want
to hear about this.

13:29.074 --> 13:30.876
Well, you're the one
that brought it up.

13:30.943 --> 13:33.045
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Paige made me realize</i>

13:33.112 --> 13:36.015
<i>that maybe I wasn't the loner</i>
<i>I thought I was.</i>

13:36.081 --> 13:38.517
<i>Maybe I was a social butterfly,</i>

13:38.584 --> 13:40.920
<i>or a social animal less</i>
<i>horrifying than a butterfly.</i>

13:40.986 --> 13:43.889
<i>Get it off the screen.</i>

13:43.956 --> 13:45.925
<i>But the point is,</i>

13:45.991 --> 13:47.493
<i>I was becoming a people person.</i>

13:48.661 --> 13:50.062
You again?

13:50.129 --> 13:52.298
Well, hello to you, too.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.133
(sighs)

13:55.601 --> 13:57.503
{\an1}I thought you were
going back to Austin?

13:57.570 --> 13:59.271
{\an3}Uh, I'm not
going back.

14:00.472 --> 14:01.907
I'm gonna drop out.

14:01.974 --> 14:04.243
What? Where will you go?

14:05.611 --> 14:08.480
I was thinking here,
in your dorm.

14:08.547 --> 14:10.316
Here?

14:10.382 --> 14:12.318
Well, I mean, just
for a couple days

14:12.384 --> 14:14.186
{\an3}until I can figure out
how to tell my mom.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.921
I don't know.

14:15.988 --> 14:16.989
{\an3}Please?

14:17.056 --> 14:18.924
I don't have
anywhere else to go,

14:18.991 --> 14:20.092
and...

14:20.159 --> 14:23.362
as embarrassing
as this is to admit...

14:23.429 --> 14:26.098
you're the only person
who can help me right now.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.000
{\an1}(sighs)

14:28.067 --> 14:29.235
{\an1}Okay.

14:29.301 --> 14:31.403
{\an3}Thanks.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.072
It's the least I can do.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.040
My life is going
so much better than yours.

14:39.011 --> 14:40.512
{\an3}Hey.

14:40.579 --> 14:42.147
Nice of you to show up.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.583
Broom closet, now.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.155
{\an1}So...

14:50.222 --> 14:52.258
{\an1}your little girlfriend
Mandy came by today,

14:52.324 --> 14:54.960
and she is pissed.

14:55.027 --> 14:56.629
{\an3}This is what I get
for telling her.

14:56.695 --> 14:59.098
{\an1}No, this is what you get
for lying to her.

14:59.164 --> 15:00.566
{\an3}I don't need you
yelling at me, too.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.135
{\an1}Well, she was yelling at me,
so now I'm yelling at you.

15:03.202 --> 15:05.437
Just because you're
having men problems,

15:05.504 --> 15:07.172
{\an3}please don't
take it out on me.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.410
All I'm saying

15:11.477 --> 15:13.245
is you really messed up.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.981
I apologized. Why are we
still talking about this?

15:16.048 --> 15:16.982
Georgie, just think

15:17.049 --> 15:18.250
{\an1}how you'd feel
if someday

15:18.317 --> 15:20.619
{\an1}somebody did that
to your sister.

15:26.058 --> 15:27.059
(door closes)

15:28.661 --> 15:29.595
{\an1}Missy?

15:29.662 --> 15:31.130
'Sup?

15:31.196 --> 15:33.132
{\an1}Can I borrow one
of your <i> Sassy</i> magazines?

15:33.198 --> 15:34.667
I knew it.

15:34.733 --> 15:37.569
Okay, look, I'm cool with this,
but do not tell Dad.

15:37.636 --> 15:39.338
Tell him what?

15:39.405 --> 15:40.939
Paige is staying
in my dorm room,

15:41.006 --> 15:42.941
and I'm making her
a care package.

15:43.008 --> 15:45.311
{\an6}Why?

15:43.008 --> 15:45.311
She wants to
drop out of college,

15:45.377 --> 15:46.712
and she hasn't
told her parents yet.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.414
And she came to you?

15:48.480 --> 15:50.449
She said I'm the only one
who would understand.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.551
{\an6}Do you?

15:50.516 --> 15:52.551
Nope.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.586
Here you go.

15:54.653 --> 15:55.954
There's an article about what

15:56.021 --> 15:57.289
{\an3}your lip gloss flavor
says about you.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.291
I'm sweet and fun
like a strawberry.

15:59.358 --> 16:00.292
I don't care.

16:00.359 --> 16:01.593
What else you bringing her?

16:01.660 --> 16:04.430
{\an1}Toothbrush, toothpaste,
pajamas,

16:04.496 --> 16:05.731
{\an1}and these
feminine napkins.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.300
{\an5}Is one box enough?

16:05.798 --> 16:08.300
Should be plenty.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.336
I hope so.
She's been awfully moody.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.706
Maybe you aren't the best person
to be handling this.

16:13.772 --> 16:15.474
Agreed, but I'm all she's got.

16:17.042 --> 16:18.377
I feel like you should tell Mom.

16:18.444 --> 16:19.745
I promised I wouldn't.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.314
I know, but this sounds serious.

16:22.381 --> 16:25.384
I got her a toothbrush and
lady pads, what more can I do?

16:26.819 --> 16:27.820
(sighs)

16:27.886 --> 16:30.055
GEORGE SR.:
<i>All right. I'll see you there.</i>

16:30.122 --> 16:31.657
{\an3}Bye.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.192
Where you going?

16:33.258 --> 16:35.994
To meet Dale at the bar. (sighs)

16:36.061 --> 16:38.764
I really don't want to hear
about this relationship anymore.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.566
At least he talks about it.

16:40.632 --> 16:43.202
My mom just wants to drink
and pretend she's fine.

16:43.268 --> 16:44.770
That sounds great.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.605
Hey, maybe you and I can switch.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.108
I'll-I'll finish the dishes,
you go hang out with Dale.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.609
We can't switch.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.177
Sure you can. Grab your coat.

16:52.811 --> 16:54.012
{\an3}Mom?

16:54.079 --> 16:55.414
Yeah, baby?

16:56.582 --> 16:58.317
I'm worried about Paige.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.155
(whispers): Who's Paige?

17:09.494 --> 17:11.430
ADULT SHELDON: <i> I may have</i>
<i>promised Paige</i>

17:11.497 --> 17:12.631
<i>I wouldn't tell my mother.</i>

17:12.698 --> 17:16.034
<i>Thankfully, Missy didn't.</i>

17:18.237 --> 17:21.240
<i>I don't know what lip gloss</i>
<i>flavor says "mature,"</i>

17:21.306 --> 17:24.041
<i>but that would be my sister.</i>

17:25.310 --> 17:26.779
{\an1}Paige?

17:26.845 --> 17:28.180
Where is she?

17:29.848 --> 17:31.150
There's a note.

17:34.386 --> 17:37.256
"Sheldon, thank you
for letting me stay here,

17:37.322 --> 17:38.424
"but I have to go.

17:38.490 --> 17:41.126
{\an3}"I'm happy
you're doing well.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.095
"I need to find that
for myself somewhere.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.596
"I hope I can.

17:44.663 --> 17:47.065
Your friend, Paige."

17:50.869 --> 17:52.805
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>After a few frantic nights,</i>

17:52.871 --> 17:54.706
<i>Paige showed up at her mom's.</i>

17:54.773 --> 17:56.809
<i>They had a lot to figure out.</i>

17:58.310 --> 18:00.412
<i>Being a parent isn't easy.</i>

18:00.479 --> 18:02.681
<i>I know I made life difficult</i>
<i>for my family.</i>

18:02.748 --> 18:05.451
<i>And my own kids</i>
<i>do the same to me.</i>

18:05.517 --> 18:07.686
<i>Just yesterday,</i>
<i>I had to take my son Leonard</i>

18:07.753 --> 18:09.221
<i>to the skate park,</i>

18:09.288 --> 18:12.157
<i>like a regular park</i>
<i>isn't bad enough.</i>

18:12.224 --> 18:15.260
<i>It's safe to say,</i>
<i>having children</i>

18:15.327 --> 18:16.728
<i>is challenging.</i>

18:24.336 --> 18:25.571
Can we talk?

18:25.637 --> 18:27.306
(sighs)

18:27.372 --> 18:28.874
We better.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.376
What's going on?

18:34.446 --> 18:36.682
I'm pregnant.
