WEBVTT

00:50.051 --> 00:51.177
Shh.

01:25.461 --> 01:29.257
The mask of Zentuo must be
returned to the temple.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.884
Now go and do not return...

01:32.051 --> 01:35.513
until you have the mask
in your possession.

01:36.138 --> 01:39.558
We hear and obey.

01:53.489 --> 01:57.660
Wowee. This Chinese New Year's
parade sure is the greatest.

01:57.827 --> 02:00.788
- And that's some dragon, huh, Shag?
- I wouldn't know.

02:01.247 --> 02:04.292
Like, I can't see a thing
except Scoob's big paws.

02:07.920 --> 02:12.341
Come on, Scooby, get off.
It's my turn to sit on your shoulders.

02:17.930 --> 02:21.142
- Oh, no. They're off balance.
- They're gonna fall.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.533
It looks like this parade
is getting dangerous.

02:37.700 --> 02:40.328
Yeah. Let's go look in a few
of the curio shops.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.788
I'll bet it'll be a lot safer.

02:42.955 --> 02:46.417
Yeah. Like, I'm for anything that's safer.

02:53.466 --> 02:56.844
Perhaps you would be interested
in this golden mask?

02:57.386 --> 02:59.847
No, thanks.
Clown faces are more my bag.

03:00.139 --> 03:02.183
I think it's groovy. I'll take it.

03:02.516 --> 03:06.645
Looks like Daphne wants to scare up
a couple of new boyfriends.

03:08.439 --> 03:12.276
- Very funny.
- Come on, you clowns. Let's eat.

03:12.485 --> 03:15.196
- Food, my favorite hobby.
- Mine too.

03:33.214 --> 03:38.636
- We have come for the golden mask.
- But I no longer have the mask.

03:38.803 --> 03:44.016
- It was just purchased by a young girl.
- Then we will find her.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.144
When we get to the restaurant...

03:47.311 --> 03:49.471
the first thing
I'm gonna order is a chop suey malt.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.399
Mm!

03:53.109 --> 03:56.153
Me too. Yipe!

03:58.864 --> 04:00.241
Ghosts!

04:00.866 --> 04:03.411
- Who are you?
- And what do you want?

04:04.161 --> 04:06.705
- We want the mask.
- With faces like that...

04:06.872 --> 04:10.960
- you ought to have two masks.
- It belongs to me, and you can't have it.

04:11.544 --> 04:15.673
- Then we will take it.
- Quick, Scooby, make like a watchdog.

04:52.793 --> 04:58.257
Hey, look. Scoob borrowed
a shirt presser from a Chinese laundry.

04:58.424 --> 05:00.593
He's making a steam smoke screen.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.303
Come on, let's get out of here.

05:06.265 --> 05:07.975
<i>And that's why we came to you.</i>

05:08.142 --> 05:10.311
<i>Being the only
Oriental art dealer in town...</i>

05:10.603 --> 05:14.315
we figured you might know
what's behind the mystery of this mask.

05:14.732 --> 05:17.985
You are right. I do know the mystery.

05:18.235 --> 05:21.614
The golden mask was
stolen many centuries ago...

05:21.780 --> 05:24.992
from the crypt
of the great warlord Zentuo.

05:25.409 --> 05:29.163
Now his ghost has returned
to claim the mask.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.665
But who are those two hooded horribles?

05:31.957 --> 05:35.419
They are his emissaries
of the living dead.

05:35.586 --> 05:38.422
You mean, like zombies?

05:42.343 --> 05:45.638
I give you a friendly warning.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.849
As long as the mask
is in your possession...

05:49.016 --> 05:52.728
you are in great danger.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.572
You think that story
of Zentuo is for real?

06:03.739 --> 06:07.785
I don't know, but those two hooded
zombies were for real enough.

06:07.952 --> 06:10.788
- Well, they're not getting my mask.
- Don't look now...

06:10.996 --> 06:13.749
but I think they're after us again.

06:14.250 --> 06:18.170
- I didn't know zombies could drive cars.
- Well, these can.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.673
Hang on, gang.
I'm gonna try and lose them.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.846
Well, they say fish
is supposed to be good for you.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.932
Yeah, but this is overdoing it.

08:35.099 --> 08:36.350
Shaggy.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.354
Shaggy!

08:40.521 --> 08:42.022
Scooby.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.483
Shaggy!

08:49.655 --> 08:53.450
Like, thanks, Scoob. I was
beginning to feel like a sardine.

08:53.617 --> 08:57.121
- Hey, where's Daphne?
- Oh, no. Look.

08:59.164 --> 09:03.168
Those two creeps have got
her and the mask.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.801
Well, we finally got
the Mystery Machine out...

09:10.968 --> 09:13.220
but there's no telling
where Daphne is.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.140
Maybe Scooby can sniff out their trail.

09:28.402 --> 09:31.530
It's, like, no use.
All he can smell is fresh fish.

09:31.697 --> 09:34.324
Hey, wait a minute. What's this?

09:34.491 --> 09:36.702
It looks like a Chinese laundry ticket.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.996
Those hooded hyenas dropped it.

09:39.163 --> 09:43.167
I can read Chinese,
but I can't make heads or tails of this.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.713
Huh?

09:54.762 --> 09:56.096
Like, what's with Scoob?

09:56.263 --> 10:00.017
That laundry ticket must have
reflected something off my glasses.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.730
Look. When it's held up to
a mirror, you can read it.

10:04.897 --> 10:08.525
It, like, says, "The temple in the hills."

10:08.817 --> 10:13.030
Hey, I know where that place is.
It's supposed to be haunted.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.240
That's where they
must have taken Daphne.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.534
Scary old place, here we come.

10:43.727 --> 10:44.937
Shh.

10:51.068 --> 10:52.903
Shh.

10:55.197 --> 10:57.658
The quickest way to find
Daphne is to split up.

10:57.825 --> 11:01.036
Shag, you and Scoob go that way.
Velma and I will go this way.

11:01.203 --> 11:03.997
But it's, like, dark
and spooky down there.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.208
Where else would ghosts be living?

11:06.375 --> 11:09.753
Yeah. I never thought of it that way.
Come on, Scooby.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.672
Coming.

11:26.728 --> 11:29.523
Nothing down here but a bunch
of dragons and statues.

11:29.690 --> 11:32.693
And don't look now,
but one of them is opening.

11:36.780 --> 11:40.784
- Help! Help! Help!
- Look! It's Daphne.

11:40.993 --> 11:43.370
Come on, you guys, get me out of here.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.623
I think she's trying to tell us something.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.377
It's a trap.

11:50.794 --> 11:54.590
- Now we're all looked in.
- And there's no way out.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.469
I wonder what's
behind that curtain, Scoob.

11:59.636 --> 12:00.888
A shower?

12:01.054 --> 12:04.558
No, it's not a shower.
Now, like, 90 in there and take a look.

12:08.854 --> 12:11.732
What are you, a dog or a mouse?

12:18.238 --> 12:21.408
How do you like that?
Man's best friend is a mouse.

12:23.285 --> 12:28.582
I guess it's up to me to take a look.
But what you can't see can't hurt you.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.336
Shaggy!

12:32.961 --> 12:35.589
I might have known
I'd walk into a flowerpot.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.927
Hand me the towel, will you, Scoob?

12:40.093 --> 12:41.720
Right.

12:45.641 --> 12:47.267
Zoinks!

12:57.611 --> 13:01.531
He'll never get through that door,
Scoob. Wouldn't you know...

13:01.698 --> 13:06.328
- he'd come through the wall?
- You have angered the ghost of Zentuo.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.497
Now you shall pay.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.958
What'll we do, Scooby-Doo?

13:15.087 --> 13:17.506
- You mean, bluff him?
- Uh-huh.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.841
It's worth a try.

13:20.676 --> 13:24.054
You don't scare us, Zentuo.

13:25.097 --> 13:27.557
Go on, I dare you to cross the line.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.810
But I warn you, I knowjudo...

13:29.977 --> 13:33.605
chop suey and Chinese checkers.

13:33.814 --> 13:37.067
Hmm. Well, how about this line?

13:49.496 --> 13:52.332
I don't think he wants to play anymore.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.298
Zoinks! The scare pair!

14:05.554 --> 14:10.684
We're running, Scoob, but, like,
we're not going anywhere.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.520
- Shaggy, look.
- Zoinks!

14:16.023 --> 14:18.608
Low bridge coming up.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.201
Faster, Scoob. Faster.

14:28.869 --> 14:32.205
Slower, Scoob! Slower!

14:49.598 --> 14:52.392
Welcome to Shag's and Scooby's...

14:52.559 --> 14:55.062
haunted Chinese restaurant.

14:55.270 --> 14:58.065
The place where the ghosts
eat the most.

14:59.900 --> 15:04.279
You two look like you could stand
a little fattening up.

15:11.828 --> 15:15.665
A bib for the boo boys.
Mustn't get dirty, you know.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.256
Here. The specialty of the house.

15:23.423 --> 15:27.094
Chocolate chop suey
and sparerib (51 la mode.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.514
If you want anything else, just go:

15:35.936 --> 15:38.563
After them.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.198
It's no use. It won't budge.

15:48.365 --> 15:51.952
I guess our only chance is if
Shag and Scoob can find us.

15:52.119 --> 15:56.123
It's up to Shag and Scoob?
Oh, boy, are we in trouble.

15:56.289 --> 16:00.168
It looks like
we finally ditched those creeps, Scoob.

16:12.556 --> 16:16.476
Don't you know it's illegal to shoot off
fireworks and wreck a storeroom?

16:16.643 --> 16:20.772
We will build a new storeroom.

16:21.815 --> 16:24.359
Like, who's gonna build a new us?

16:28.572 --> 16:31.658
Come on, Scoob.
We gotta put out that fuse.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.327
Okay.

16:36.454 --> 16:40.083
One more bounce ought to do it.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.669
We did it.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.268
Well, what do you know? We're free.

17:02.731 --> 17:06.234
Lucky you two landed on the idol's arms.
That's what opened it.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.862
Like, now that we've found you,
let's get lost.

17:09.029 --> 17:13.700
- Not before we solve this mystery.
- We've just got to find a clue.

17:13.867 --> 17:18.496
I know where there's one. I saw it
when those two goons brought me here.

17:23.168 --> 17:26.755
- A pigeon coop?
- I think Daphne was right.

17:26.922 --> 17:31.760
These are carrier pigeons. And listen
to the message tied to this one's leg.

17:31.927 --> 17:35.889
"November 10th, 12:30, hidden cove."

17:36.056 --> 17:41.061
- But, like, what does it mean?
- This mystery is just about solved.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.814
Right. And all that's left to do
is trap Mr. Zentuo.

17:44.981 --> 17:49.236
But first, we'll need a Chinese gong,
a couple of Roman candle rockets...

17:49.402 --> 17:51.905
and Shaggy's model train set
from the Mystery Machine.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.032
Huh?

17:55.450 --> 17:58.078
I sure hope this
crazy contraption works.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.122
Sure it will. When Zentuo
comes through that doorway...

18:01.289 --> 18:03.208
he'll step right on that gong.

18:03.375 --> 18:06.044
Then we pull the string
that snaps the mousetrap...

18:06.211 --> 18:09.756
and strikes the match on the
sandpaper so it can light the fuse.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.592
Then old 'Tuo will rocket
down the train tracks...

18:12.759 --> 18:15.262
into that pigeon coop,
where we'll have him.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.473
If <i>Scoob's</i> finished laying
the track, we're all set to go.

18:18.640 --> 18:23.103
Like, he better be,
because here comes Zentuo now.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.417
YikeS!

18:50.588 --> 18:52.590
Phew.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.468
Uh-oh.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.800
Well, it's not the way we planned it...

19:35.967 --> 19:39.346
but it looks like we've got ourselves
a sackful of ghosts.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.767
Scooby-Doo!

19:43.975 --> 19:47.145
From the beginning, we suspected
Mr. Fong was the leader...

19:47.312 --> 19:49.606
of an international smuggling ring...

19:49.773 --> 19:52.275
but could never get any evidence
to prove it.

19:52.442 --> 19:56.529
Well, this mask will give you
all the evidence you need, Inspector Lu.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.698
Each month,
one of these masks was sent...

19:58.865 --> 20:01.034
to Mr. Fong
from out of the country.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.286
Inside there's a roll of recording tape...

20:03.453 --> 20:05.872
with the names and dates
of all their shipments.

20:06.039 --> 20:10.043
They play the tapes, write down the
information on tiny slips of paper...

20:10.210 --> 20:12.670
and send it to their gang
by carrier pigeon.

20:12.837 --> 20:15.215
But how did you kids get the mask?

20:15.382 --> 20:18.676
By accident. It was delivered
to a curio shop by mistake...

20:18.843 --> 20:21.971
- where I bought it.
- And this ghost getup...

20:22.138 --> 20:25.975
was used to scare away anyone
who got curious about this old temple.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.686
You know, all this excitement
has made me hungry.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.647
- Me too.
- Well, fellas...

20:30.814 --> 20:34.192
I just happen to have
one Scooby snack with me...

20:34.359 --> 20:36.319
but you'll have to jump for it.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.905
This'll be a cinch.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.922
Scooby-Doo.

20:56.089 --> 21:00.552
How do you like that?
Outfoxed by a mouse.

21:50.768 --> 21:51.895
Shh.
