My name's Moose. Moose Freed.
I live down the street, too.

12:28.584 --> 12:29.823
Um...

12:30.856 --> 12:31.984
Yeah, but don't forget
to ask your dad

12:32.019 --> 12:33.860
about the lawn thingy.

12:34.429 --> 12:36.159
Yeah. (CHUCKLES) I won't.

12:37.226 --> 12:38.958
(SIGHS) Oh,
now I got to go see Evan.

12:38.993 --> 12:40.900
(GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING)

12:43.539 --> 12:45.237
Sorry you got stuck
with Moose.

12:45.273 --> 12:47.137
Oh, that's okay.

12:47.805 --> 12:50.204
Anyways, listen, Margaret.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.845
I've decided I want you
to join my secret club.

12:52.881 --> 12:55.447
There's three of us
and I'm letting in one more.

12:55.482 --> 12:56.616
But you can't wear socks

12:56.652 --> 12:58.115
or else the others
might not want you.

12:58.680 --> 12:59.919
Oh.

13:00.684 --> 13:01.781
See you later.

13:13.295 --> 13:14.994
It's the first day
of school tomorrow.

13:15.029 --> 13:16.669
I met this girl, Nancy.

13:16.704 --> 13:18.972
I don't really know
if she liked me.

13:19.007 --> 13:24.570
I think she just expected me
to be different or something.

13:26.208 --> 13:29.976
Anyway, well,
it did get me thinking.

13:30.011 --> 13:33.312
Maybe it is time for...

13:33.347 --> 13:37.356
things to be happening
around here?

13:37.391 --> 13:38.419
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

BARBARA: It was in
with the bathroom stuff.

13:46.063 --> 13:47.631
I found this, too,
if you need it.

13:47.666 --> 13:48.699
MARGARET:<i> Thanks, God.</i>

13:48.734 --> 13:50.535
-Thanks, Mom.
-Mmm-hmm.

for your first day?
How you feeling?

13:57.578 --> 13:59.176
It's going to be great, right?

13:59.212 --> 14:02.812
And if it's not great, first
days don't count anyways.

14:02.847 --> 14:04.047
-Right?
-BARBARA: Exactly.

14:04.082 --> 14:05.312
-HERB: All right.
See you later.
-Bye!

14:05.348 --> 14:08.320

-Did I not
unpack your socks?

14:08.356 --> 14:10.983
Oh, um, uh...

14:11.019 --> 14:12.051
I don't want socks.

14:12.087 --> 14:14.260
Why? You'll get blisters.

14:14.296 --> 14:15.588
I just don't.

-Yeah!

-Hey. Um...
-Hey.

14:28.003 --> 14:29.135
I forgot to ask you.

14:29.170 --> 14:30.809
Um, a boy named Moose asked

14:30.844 --> 14:32.977
if he can cut our lawn
for five bucks.

14:33.013 --> 14:35.713
Moose? Well, tell him thanks,
but no, thanks.

14:35.748 --> 14:37.014
I just got a new power mower

14:37.050 --> 14:39.252
and I'm really excited
for the grass to grow.

-Okay.
-Bye.

I thought you'd forget.

15:23.696 --> 15:24.762

I was telling you about.

-Hi, nice to meet you.

-Yeah, you, too.
-And this is Gretchen.

-So, you're the fourth.
-Yeah.

15:33.204 --> 15:35.237
Well, you're lucky
we saved you a seat.

next to Norman Fisher.

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, don't look.

Philip Leroy just walked in.

15:48.352 --> 15:51.149
I was praying so hard
he'd be in our class.

15:51.185 --> 15:52.586
Who's Philip Leroy?

15:53.461 --> 15:54.654
Take a guess.

16:03.065 --> 16:04.367
Is that our teacher?

16:05.440 --> 16:08.073
Her? (GIGGLES) No.

16:08.108 --> 16:11.044
That's Laura Danker.
Stay away from her, okay?

My brother says that

introduce myself.

I am Mr. Benedict.

16:34.231 --> 16:35.629
Please complete
the following sentences

other a little better, yeah?

Now, I'll begin, just to
start things off for you guys.

16:43.842 --> 16:45.142
I love that I'm finally

16:45.177 --> 16:47.509
getting to be a teacher
for the first time.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.380
I hate...

16:51.014 --> 16:52.281
feeling self-conscious

16:52.316 --> 16:53.578
trying not to feel
self-conscious because

16:53.614 --> 16:56.251
then you only feel
more self-conscious

16:56.286 --> 16:57.382
and then you're blabbing
in front of

16:57.417 --> 16:58.650
a whole bunch of kids. Um...

16:58.686 --> 17:01.721

the year with you all.

You said she's out at 3:15
and the walk is ten minutes.

18:32.514 --> 18:34.554
Yes, I did say that.
But, well...

18:34.589 --> 18:35.549
I'm sure she'll be

-And how are you?
<i>-Oh, fine.</i>

have any loved ones around

your life expectancy
drops drastically,

18:59.277 --> 19:00.908

I've had a good run.

-Oh. Where's the Band-Aids?

it's actually not that bad.

Wonderful news.

19:26.037 --> 19:27.470

19:27.506 --> 19:30.436
that you could come visit
the weekend after next.

it was your idea.

But you just got home.

I haven't even heard
about your day yet.

19:58.272 --> 20:01.133
-I know, but can I go?
-Can I have one word?

Laura Danker again.

20:21.362 --> 20:24.457
Yeah. And how she got
even bigger over the summer.

20:24.492 --> 20:26.827
Yeah, she looked so grown up.

20:26.862 --> 20:28.762

a bra since fourth grade?

20:28.798 --> 20:30.667

she gets her period, too.

I know for sure
someone in the school does.

in the stall?

what happens here,

-Duh.

NANCY: Second, if you want
to be in the club,

20:50.058 --> 20:51.922
then you have to
follow the rules.

20:51.958 --> 20:53.293
What kind of rules?

20:53.328 --> 20:56.054
(SIGHS) Well, I don't know.
I'm thinking of them.

20:57.227 --> 20:59.596
Don't rush me. Hmm.

21:00.669 --> 21:01.929
Oh, I have one.

then you have to wear a bra.

GRETCHEN: I have one.

21:09.235 --> 21:12.670

you have to tell us about it.

Yeah, with the Boy Books,
we have to show them

I'm so sorry.

23:55.175 --> 23:57.674
Thank you all for coming.

23:57.710 --> 24:00.411
Delano is nothing without
its dedicated parents.

24:00.446 --> 24:01.772
Let's dive right in
and get started

24:01.808 --> 24:03.477
the way we do every year,

24:03.513 --> 24:05.243
by forming our committees.

24:05.279 --> 24:08.414
First up,
we have the Campus
Improvement Committee.

24:08.450 --> 24:09.480
Any volunteers?

24:09.516 --> 24:11.252
Ooh. Okay.

24:11.288 --> 24:13.488
Oh. Wonderful.

24:13.524 --> 24:16.921
Uh-huh. Barbara,
I got you. Okay.

24:16.957 --> 24:20.533
Next, the Delano
Social Committee.

24:21.034 --> 24:21.859
Sure, yeah. Okay.

24:21.895 --> 24:25.403
-Okay.
-(LAUGHS LIGHTLY) Great.

24:25.438 --> 24:27.738
All right.
The Fundraising Committee.

24:30.209 --> 24:31.340
Good for you, Barbara.

24:31.376 --> 24:32.704
This is going to be great.

24:32.739 --> 24:34.841
All right, pencils down.

24:34.876 --> 24:37.478
Kindly pass
your worksheets forward.

24:37.513 --> 24:39.417
How'd you do, Margaret?

24:39.452 --> 24:40.479
MARGARET: I think
I did pretty good.

24:40.515 --> 24:41.684
All right, uh...

24:41.719 --> 24:44.082
Before the bell,
I want to share some news

24:44.117 --> 24:46.757
that I think will make you all
very happy.

24:46.792 --> 24:49.793
(CHUCKLES) Now that you all
are in the sixth grade,

24:49.828 --> 24:53.891
you'll get to do a full,
year-long research project.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.934
-(STUDENTS GROANING)
-Yes!

24:55.970 --> 24:57.299

24:57.335 --> 24:59.536
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

24:59.571 --> 25:00.666
Margaret, I would like
to talk to you

25:00.702 --> 25:02.669
for a moment after class.

25:02.705 --> 25:05.270
Uh-oh.
What'd you do, Margaret?

25:11.218 --> 25:13.212
-Hi.
-Please have a seat.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.381
So basically,
I'm just having little chats

25:17.417 --> 25:20.059
with each student in advance
of your research projects

25:20.094 --> 25:21.153
to answer any questions

25:21.188 --> 25:23.728
or perhaps guide you
toward a topic of choice.

25:24.392 --> 25:25.563
Oh.

25:25.598 --> 25:27.994
And I read your
getting-to-know-you paper.

25:28.029 --> 25:30.027
And I noticed
under the "I hate" section,

25:30.063 --> 25:32.897
you wrote
"religious holidays."

25:32.932 --> 25:35.971
Which I... I found curious.

25:38.974 --> 25:41.774
If you don't want to share,
you don't...

25:41.809 --> 25:43.148
You don't have to, Margaret.

25:43.183 --> 25:45.176
Oh, no. It's just, um...

25:45.211 --> 25:47.111
I guess I just
don't like those holidays

25:47.146 --> 25:49.355
because I don't
celebrate any of them.

25:49.390 --> 25:51.556
My dad is Jewish
and my mom's Christian,

25:51.592 --> 25:54.493
so instead of picking
which religion I am, uh,

25:54.528 --> 25:56.426
they just decided
that I wouldn't have one

25:56.462 --> 25:58.562
and I can choose
when I grow up.

25:58.597 --> 26:01.731
And have you
given that much thought?

26:01.767 --> 26:03.862
Not really. My grandma
wants me to be Jewish.

26:03.897 --> 26:04.997
And your other grandparents

26:05.032 --> 26:07.198
want you to be Christian,
I imagine.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.140
I don't know.
I've never met them before.

26:09.175 --> 26:10.671
They live in Ohio.

26:10.707 --> 26:12.304
So you've never met them
at all?

26:14.410 --> 26:15.780
-No.
-Oh.

26:16.613 --> 26:20.048
Well, if I may suggest it,

26:20.883 --> 26:22.884
I feel like
"religion" could be

26:22.919 --> 26:25.218
a very compelling
research topic for you.

maybe something modern?

26:56.021 --> 26:58.557

about it. How was school?

27:01.126 --> 27:02.759

that we don't see them

so far away,

even talk to them?

What?

28:07.795 --> 28:10.829

very devout Christians, and...

28:11.529 --> 28:12.961
before you were born,

28:12.996 --> 28:16.527
when your dad
and I first fell in love,

28:16.562 --> 28:21.470
um, they told me that
it would be very hard for them

28:21.505 --> 28:23.171
to, uh, have a...

very hard for them

28:29.416 --> 28:31.945
to have a Jewish son-in-law.

28:31.981 --> 28:34.583
And that
if I wanted to marry him,

28:34.619 --> 28:36.720
that was my business, but

28:36.755 --> 28:39.385
I wouldn't be
their daughter anymore.
