13:35.460 --> 13:39.460
And don't buy anything off anyone. No matter what they say.

13:39.460 --> 13:43.460
You'll wind up spending 20 quid on a little white tablet

13:43.460 --> 13:45.460
that turns out to be aspirin, trust me.

13:45.460 --> 13:46.500
- I know.
- Right, right.

13:46.500 --> 13:50.980
Also, if I'm crossing a busy road, should I look both ways first or...?

13:50.980 --> 13:53.460
Too much?

13:54.460 --> 13:56.460
I appreciate the effort, though.

14:09.300 --> 14:11.460
- Is that a friend of yours?
- Hmm?

14:11.460 --> 14:13.460
Oh, yeah. Goes to my school.

14:13.460 --> 14:16.460
Oh. "Yeah. Goes to my school."

14:21.140 --> 14:23.300
Really?

14:25.460 --> 14:28.300
You do know Olivia's sat doing her...?

14:28.300 --> 14:30.460
Olivia's sat doing what?

14:30.460 --> 14:32.460
Nothing. Just forget it.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.460
There you go, guys. Thanks very much.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.140
£10 for a measly burger?

14:41.140 --> 14:43.460
What is it, foie gras?

14:43.460 --> 14:45.460
It's practically extorsion.

14:46.460 --> 14:51.660
I've got £8.76. No, sorry.

14:51.660 --> 14:54.460
Help a brother out, will you?

14:54.460 --> 14:58.140
- Are you having a laugh? Next.
- Hiya, mate.

14:58.140 --> 15:01.460
Can I have a Burger-licious, please, and a portion of fries?

15:07.460 --> 15:11.140
There you are, mate. Enjoy yourself.

15:12.140 --> 15:15.820
Oh. Homemade? How many for £8.76?

15:18.460 --> 15:21.460
- Are you police?
- Me? Heavens, no.

15:22.460 --> 15:26.460
Don't worry, I'm sure that street trading and pedlar laws

15:26.460 --> 15:28.660
don't apply to temporary locales like this.

15:33.460 --> 15:36.460
Hmm.

15:42.460 --> 15:44.460
Thank you. Oh.

15:44.460 --> 15:48.460
Hello? Hiya.

15:48.460 --> 15:51.460
Oh. Really?

15:51.460 --> 15:54.460
Sounds bloody great. Where exactly is it?

15:57.460 --> 16:01.460
Oh. No, Ian. Don't be silly.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.460
Course he doesn't suspect anything.

16:04.460 --> 16:08.500
He even complimented me on this new dress you bought me.

16:10.460 --> 16:15.660
I know. He is so stupid.

16:15.660 --> 16:20.460
Not all learned like you, Ian.

16:27.460 --> 16:28.460
Dad?

16:28.460 --> 16:31.140
OK. Yeah. See you in five.

16:31.140 --> 16:33.460
- Dad.
- What?

16:33.460 --> 16:35.460
I should really head off to the band.

16:35.460 --> 16:38.460
Oh, yeah, you should. Yeah, yeah. Go on. Go, go, go. Yeah.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.300
Tell 'em I'll be along in a bit.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.460
- I'm heading to the stage, Mum.
- Aw, see you there.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.460
Jen. Who was that on the phone?

16:44.460 --> 16:48.460
My new mates. They're doing shots in the Graffiti tent.

16:48.460 --> 16:50.460
Actually, I'm gonna head over there now.

16:50.460 --> 16:53.460
Ooh, can I come? Please, can I come?

16:53.460 --> 16:55.460
Yes, you can, young lady.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.460
And give me some of that glitter of yours.

16:57.460 --> 17:00.460
Oh, Pete. Come and find us when you're finished, will ya?

17:00.460 --> 17:04.460
I'll be the one dancing on the podium,

17:04.460 --> 17:06.460
pint glass on the end...

17:07.660 --> 17:10.500
Graffiti tent, here we come. Off to get a drink.

17:12.500 --> 17:16.460
Now, invest your profits. That's the key.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.460
A little bit here, a little bit there.

17:18.460 --> 17:20.460
Spread it out.

17:20.460 --> 17:23.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't put it all in the same place.

17:23.460 --> 17:27.140
- I hear you.
- Exactly. Minimise risk.

17:27.140 --> 17:29.460
You gotta give yourself space to grow.

17:29.460 --> 17:32.460
Well, I do most of it in the loft. Ta.

17:32.460 --> 17:35.460
That's good. Starting from home. Hmm.

17:35.460 --> 17:38.460
So, what are your overheads like?

17:38.460 --> 17:42.460
I just shifted from fluorescent to metal-halide, actually.

17:43.460 --> 17:46.300
- Uh-huh.
- Man, you really know your stuff, don't ya?

17:46.300 --> 17:48.460
I used to do this for a living.

17:48.460 --> 17:49.460
I would give you my card

17:49.460 --> 17:52.460
but I'm sort of between jobs at the moment.

17:53.460 --> 17:56.460
Actually, between rather a lot of things, actually.

17:57.460 --> 18:00.460
I feel you, bro. We've all been there.

18:01.460 --> 18:04.460
- Cookies help, though, eh?
- They certainly fill a hole.

18:04.460 --> 18:06.660
That's deep, man.

18:09.460 --> 18:11.460
Really good chatting to you.

18:11.460 --> 18:13.660
And good luck with it all.

18:13.660 --> 18:18.460
- Hey.
- Oh. Gosh.

18:18.460 --> 18:21.460
Oh, well, thank you.

18:49.460 --> 18:51.660
Hi, you all right? Have you been in yet?

18:58.660 --> 19:00.820
- All right, mate?
- Hello.

19:03.460 --> 19:05.820
Have you noticed anything strange about Jen lately?

19:07.460 --> 19:09.460
- Like what?
- Oh, I dunno.

19:09.460 --> 19:12.460
It looks like I'm losing her to her new academic life

19:12.460 --> 19:14.460
and I didn't even see it coming.

19:16.460 --> 19:19.300
Maybe she's right, I should be paying more attention to the family,

19:19.300 --> 19:21.460
not some random canal jumper.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.820
Maybe I've taken my eye off the ball.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.460
Maybe I've become too complacent.

19:28.460 --> 19:32.140
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

19:33.460 --> 19:35.460
Maybe these are pointless questions

19:35.460 --> 19:38.300
that you can pointlessly torment yourself with tomorrow.

19:39.460 --> 19:41.460
Today's about your son and the band

19:41.460 --> 19:44.460
and being at the start of something amazing.

19:45.460 --> 19:47.460
Isn't it, eh?

19:47.460 --> 19:50.460
Yeah.

19:50.460 --> 19:54.460
Yes. You're damn right.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.460
Right. I'm off to the sound check.

20:01.300 --> 20:04.460
- Hey. We should get a reading.
- Hey?

20:04.460 --> 20:07.460
- Oh, come on. It'll be fun.
- Oh, God. No.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.460
You don't wanna worry about the future.

20:09.460 --> 20:13.460
Living in the here and now. That's what it's all about.

20:20.460 --> 20:21.500
First round's on me.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.460
Right. Come on.

20:23.460 --> 20:25.980
Pens down. You're not hiding out in here all day.

20:25.980 --> 20:27.460
You do know when my exams are?

20:27.460 --> 20:30.460
I do, yes. And I also know you're allowed some down time.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.460
Come on, your sister's off enjoying herself

20:32.460 --> 20:34.460
and she's barely done any revision at all.

20:34.460 --> 20:36.460
Did that argument sound better in your head?

20:36.460 --> 20:39.460
It did, yes, but come on, the point still stands.

20:39.460 --> 20:42.460
Fine. I was gonna stop anyway.

20:43.460 --> 20:45.460
Good girl.

20:46.460 --> 20:49.140
Er, can I help you?

20:49.140 --> 20:52.460
No, I think I can help you. Love Comes Slowly.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.460
Tell me about it.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.820
Seriously, Karen, who brings a book to a festival?

20:56.820 --> 20:59.460
- And a dirty one, at that.
- It's not dirty.

20:59.460 --> 21:03.140
It's contemporary romance. And what do you mean, help me?

21:03.140 --> 21:04.500
Help me do what, exactly?

21:04.500 --> 21:08.460
Well, follow your own advice. Ditch the homework, have some fun.

21:08.460 --> 21:09.980
Excuse me, what's that supposed to mean?

21:09.980 --> 21:13.140
- Well...
- Where's Matt?

21:13.140 --> 21:15.460
- What?
- Oh, I get it.

21:15.460 --> 21:17.140
You've been dumped, haven't you?

21:17.140 --> 21:19.460
Now you don't know what to do with yourself.

21:19.460 --> 21:22.460
Well, that makes two of us. Come on. What do you say we team up,

21:22.460 --> 21:25.460
get out there and I'll show you what festivals are really all about?

21:25.460 --> 21:26.460
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

21:26.460 --> 21:29.460
- OK.
- What's that? Gimme, gimme.

21:29.460 --> 21:31.660
That, Adam, is my festival hat.

21:31.660 --> 21:35.460
Glasto '94? That's 25 years ago.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.460
- Yeah, so?
- Festivals have changed somewhat.

21:38.460 --> 21:39.820
When was the last time you were at one?

21:39.820 --> 21:42.460
Sorry, what? Pardon?

21:42.460 --> 21:44.460
Reading. Reading 1992!

21:44.460 --> 21:47.460
Yeah, well, that'd make me a whole two years closer to all this.

21:47.460 --> 21:52.460
So how about I show you what festivals are really about?

21:52.460 --> 21:54.460
- Come on.
- Okey-doke.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.960
- Jen, can you hear me?
- 'What?'

21:59.960 --> 22:03.960
- Where are ya?
- I can't hear you.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.960
- 'Where are you?'
- Graffiti tent.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.960
- Jen?
- 'Hang on. Hang on.'

22:16.960 --> 22:20.960
- Agh. Hello?
- I'm on my way to the band tent.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.960
To be honest, I think it'd be nice if -

22:22.960 --> 22:25.960
- 'What? I can't hear ya.'
- I said I'm on my way...

22:30.960 --> 22:32.960

22:35.960 --> 22:37.960

This is what you think festivals are really all about?

23:33.960 --> 23:35.960
- Shh.
- Absolutely.

You smile at me, I wink at you.

23:40.960 --> 23:43.960

- What, this?
- Yeah.

23:47.960 --> 23:53.960
Are these emoticons or emotional cons?

23:53.960 --> 23:55.960
It's a poem about a mobile phone, Karen.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.960
It is a metaphor.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.960
I don't want you to go.

24:00.960 --> 24:04.480
But I can't find my charger.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.960
Shh.

24:08.320 --> 24:13.960
Were we ever truly together?

24:16.960 --> 24:19.960
- Terrible.
- I told you, it's different now.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.960
I suppose 25 years is quite a long time.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.160
- Karen and Rachel?
- Mm-hm.

24:26.160 --> 24:29.960
- My Rachel?
- Not back then, she wasn't.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.960
No, I suppose she wasn't.

24:33.960 --> 24:36.640
I don't think she ever told me she'd been to Glastonbury.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.960
Ooh, yeah. You wouldn't have caught either of us

24:38.960 --> 24:40.960
sitting around reading a book back then, trust me.

24:40.960 --> 24:44.960
'What happens at the festival stays at the festival.'

24:44.960 --> 24:48.640
- Do tell.
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. Sorry, Adam.

24:48.640 --> 24:51.960

24:51.960 --> 24:56.800

25:05.960 --> 25:07.960

25:18.960 --> 25:21.640
I thought we were going for the whole festival experience.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.800
- Really?
- Yes.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.960
What, can't take the pace?

25:26.960 --> 25:29.480

- You started it.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.960
But we've been here way too long.

26:39.960 --> 26:44.160
I say we head to the main stage, get our dance on.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.640
Yes!

26:46.640 --> 26:47.960
Mmm.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.960
- OK. Come on.
- Whoo!

27:05.960 --> 27:08.960
Whoo! Absolutely perfect. Nailed it!

27:08.960 --> 27:09.960
Right, let's try another one.

27:09.960 --> 27:13.960
- Dad, I think we're good.
- Good? Hah.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.960
You're off the Richter scale. People won't know what's hit 'em.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.960
No, I mean, I think we can manage on our own.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.160
- OK.
- Erm, Adam's dad?

27:27.160 --> 27:29.960
- Hmm.
- Is your mate OK?

27:36.960 --> 27:38.960
David?

27:43.160 --> 27:44.800
- David?
- Bloody hell.

27:46.960 --> 27:50.960
David? Mate.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
- What's wrong with him?
- I have no idea.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.960
- Heatstroke?
- I'm having a stroke?

27:59.960 --> 28:02.960
- You're having a stroke?
- I'm having a what?

28:06.960 --> 28:09.960
That was bloody great.

28:09.960 --> 28:11.960
You know, it's good to unwind for once.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.320
Oh, please. Since when do you need to unwind?

28:15.320 --> 28:17.960
Half your life's been one long festival and you know it.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.800
- Karen, that is...
- ..true.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.960
I know. I was talking about you.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.480
I mean, you know, you work, you sleep, you work, you sleep

28:26.480 --> 28:28.960
and somewhere in between all that,

28:28.960 --> 28:31.000
you find time to worry about your kids,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.960
worry about your friends, worry about me.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.960
Yeah, well, someone has to, don't they?

28:35.960 --> 28:37.960
Well, I'm glad you did.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.960
I needed that kick up the arse you gave me, Karen.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.640
I needed those therapy sessions.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.000
Do you know the one thing I've learnt from -

28:44.000 --> 28:47.960
Oh, here we go. Four sessions and he's bloody Sigmund Freud.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.960
The one thing I have learnt is that

28:50.960 --> 28:52.960
I spend most of my time thinking about myself.

28:52.960 --> 28:56.960
You spend most of yours thinking about everybody but.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.960
I do think about myself, believe me.

29:00.160 --> 29:02.320
About whether I work too much,

29:02.320 --> 29:04.960
worry about the children too much.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.960
The fact that I'm 50,

29:06.960 --> 29:09.960
divorced, single.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.960
For all I know, this is as good as it's gonna get.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.960
I think about all of those things.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.960
And?

29:16.960 --> 29:21.960
And... well, I ask myself, "Are you happy?"

29:23.480 --> 29:25.960
To my amazement, I find myself saying,

29:25.960 --> 29:29.960
"Yeah. Yeah. I am."

29:29.960 --> 29:33.480
Jesus. 50 quid a pop, those sessions are costing me

29:33.480 --> 29:34.960
and I'm nowhere near that level.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.960
Well, it's kind of more of a week eight thing.

29:36.960 --> 29:39.960
- You'll get there.
- Oh, week eight, OK.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.960
- Hmm.
- Thanks, though.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.960
For asking. Thanks.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.480
- David?
- Can you hear me?

29:48.480 --> 29:50.640
Oh, my God. David?

29:50.640 --> 29:51.960
What's happened?

29:51.960 --> 29:54.960
I don't know. He was fine and then he just...

29:54.960 --> 29:57.960
I think it's low blood sugar. I've got medical training.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.960
He said he skipped breakfast.

29:59.960 --> 30:01.960
David, have you eaten anything?

30:01.960 --> 30:03.960
Biscuits.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.960
Hello?

30:07.480 --> 30:10.960
What sort of biscuits? You didn't buy them here, did you?

30:12.320 --> 30:15.800
- Hello.
- Ah-hah.

30:15.800 --> 30:19.960
I'm not medically trained like you but my professional opinion...

30:19.960 --> 30:24.960
he's tripping balls. Balls.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.960
Yeah. We'll handle it from here. Thanks very much.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.480

Pete, Pete, aren't you supposed to be somewhere?

30:35.960 --> 30:38.960
- Oh, yeah.
- Go on. We'll get him back to the yurt.

30:38.960 --> 30:42.000
Oh, thanks, guys. See you there.

Yeah, well, it's always the quiet ones.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.160
Tits.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.960
Oh, hi! Ian! Yay, you made it.

31:05.960 --> 31:08.160
Oh, hey. Course I did. I told you I would.

31:08.160 --> 31:12.960
This is the best time ever.

31:13.960 --> 31:18.480
- Love you.
- Oh. Uh. OK.

31:21.960 --> 31:27.960

31:27.960 --> 31:29.960
- Dad. Dad.
- What?

31:29.960 --> 31:33.960
- Is he OK?
- Oh, David. Yeah, yeah, he's fine.

31:33.960 --> 31:37.160
It was just... something he ate.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.960
- I've not missed it, have I?
- No, no.

31:38.960 --> 31:41.960
- We're supposed to be on next but - - Supposed to be?

31:41.960 --> 31:43.960

32:08.960 --> 32:12.480
- No.
- Wait here.
