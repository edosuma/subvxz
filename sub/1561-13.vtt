00:01.043 --> 00:03.262
(narrator)
Previously on "Constantine.."

00:03.462 --> 00:06.762
I always took you for a,
a voodoo priest

00:06.965 --> 00:09.013
with a flair for the dramatic.

00:09.218 --> 00:10.265
I do what's needed.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.767
They are back. La Brujeria.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.349
- The rising darkness.
- The Brujeria are behind it.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.606
Jim Corrigan, NOLA PD Homicide.
And you are?

00:18.810 --> 00:20.232
Here to help you, Jimmy boy.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.696
I'd like you to get
on your hotline to hell.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.527
Find out about this
rising darkness.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.070
Sister.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.905
[whispering]

00:30.113 --> 00:33.617
A darkness is coming, heralded
by someone close to you.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.078
Someone who will betray you.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.343
[intense music]

00:43.544 --> 00:44.796
[door creaks]

00:55.264 --> 00:57.858
(The Man) 'That's it.'

00:58.058 --> 00:59.731
Rise up now.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.940
I need your help.
It's my wedding night.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.695
Look at my sweet babies.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.155
Oh, yeah.

01:16.952 --> 01:19.831
[birds chirping]

01:23.750 --> 01:25.627
[owl hooting]

01:33.677 --> 01:36.556
[intense music]

01:42.894 --> 01:45.272
You're gonna die, child.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.824
You're gonna... die.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.368
(Amberly) 'Hey!'

01:49.568 --> 01:50.865
Leave her alone.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.540
You alright?

02:02.998 --> 02:04.124
I'm fine.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.878
I-I just..

02:08.086 --> 02:10.088
There's nothing be scared of,
is there?

02:12.174 --> 02:13.266
No.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.265
[exhales]

02:15.469 --> 02:17.392
I don't know why.

02:17.596 --> 02:21.851
Why are you out here so late...
all alone?

02:22.059 --> 02:24.858
- Are you lonely?
- I snuck out of the house.

02:25.062 --> 02:28.282
Me and my mama
was arguing again.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.734
How come y'all are out so late?

02:29.941 --> 02:32.239
He lets us do whatever we want.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.657
- Who does?
- The Man.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.917
We're married to him.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.250
All of us.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.962
[chuckles]

02:48.794 --> 02:50.512
I always dreamed
of getting married.

02:52.798 --> 02:55.176
I even stole
my mama's wedding ring.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.637
Would you
like a wedding ring now?

02:58.970 --> 03:00.688
Your very own wedding ring?

03:02.349 --> 03:04.647
[laughs] I guess.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.396
Can I see yours?

03:10.774 --> 03:12.196
Aren't they beautiful?

03:14.736 --> 03:16.204
Does it hurt?

03:16.405 --> 03:19.329
Only at first, but after

03:19.533 --> 03:21.501
you don't feel a thing.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.704
You know, if you're married
to The Man

03:23.912 --> 03:26.631
you'd never be alone again.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.926
We'd be a family.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.594
All of us.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.717
You want to marry The Man?

03:38.885 --> 03:40.228
Yes.

03:40.429 --> 03:41.897
Please.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.976
Come on.
We'll take you home with us.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.901
You're gonna make
a beautiful bride.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.524
[girls laughing]

03:48.729 --> 03:50.072
(The Man)
'That's my good girls.'

03:58.947 --> 04:01.826
[intense music]

04:07.372 --> 04:08.669
Picked a hell of a night
to be sitting out here

04:08.874 --> 04:10.842
in your truck, mister.

04:11.042 --> 04:15.047
Ain't nowhere to go.
My truck's broke.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.053
Flat battery.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.259
Well, I reckon
you're lucky I come along.

04:19.468 --> 04:20.720
Go ahead and pop that hood.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.099
'I'll get my jumper cables'

04:22.304 --> 04:24.853
'and we'll have you on your way
in no time.'

04:25.056 --> 04:27.525
Cool. That's kind, kind of you.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.444
Merci beaucoup.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.001
You alright, mister?

04:46.453 --> 04:48.296
I found these here.

04:48.497 --> 04:49.669
Okay.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.342
Well, they ought to do.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.589
Yes, they ought to.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.467
[choking]

04:57.255 --> 05:00.134
[theme music]

05:17.567 --> 05:20.320
[indistinct chatter]

05:20.529 --> 05:23.703
(Constantine) 'You were wise to
call me in, Detective Corrigan.'

05:23.907 --> 05:26.751
Spontaneous desiccation.

05:26.952 --> 05:30.957
Now, that is not something
you see every day.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.838
Your mate here,
he was mummified.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.044
Dupree, John.

05:36.253 --> 05:39.632
- His name was Clement Dupree.
- Right.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.308
And you believe
Detective Dupree was murdered

05:41.508 --> 05:42.725
because of a case
he was working.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.725
Missing Persons.
Three girls, same age.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.055
Dupree believed
they were abducted

05:47.264 --> 05:49.517
had this theory about
blood moons?

05:49.724 --> 05:52.352
The lunar tetrad.

05:52.561 --> 05:55.314
Four successive lunar eclipses
six months apart.

05:55.522 --> 05:58.742
The last in the cycle
is tonight. The blood moon.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.991
Dupree was killed the same night
the third girl got took.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.493
What is this?

06:04.698 --> 06:08.123
Looks like the killer had
some fun with a branding iron.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.794
I'd best see the body.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.961
[man whimpering]

06:14.165 --> 06:17.760
This a nice, nice home
you got here, partner, for sure!

06:17.961 --> 06:19.087
[man sobbing]

06:19.296 --> 06:23.142
(male #1) 'Please, let me go.'

06:25.135 --> 06:27.137
Jamais de la vie!

06:27.345 --> 06:30.849
You a hunter! I like to hunt.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.900
Mais you ought to know that.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.233
(male #1) 'Please.'

06:36.438 --> 06:38.566
'Why are you doing this?'

06:38.732 --> 06:41.235
Don't make so much noise
over there, you hear me?

06:41.443 --> 06:43.320
[hissing]

06:43.528 --> 06:45.781
You made me
miss my own weddin' night.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.286
That's alright.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.539
See, we gonna make
a nice, nice weddin' gift.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.337
How that sound, partner?

06:52.537 --> 06:55.256
[sizzling]

06:55.415 --> 06:57.759
(male #1) 'No, no.'

06:57.959 --> 07:00.758
'No! Please!'

07:00.962 --> 07:01.929
[grunting]

07:02.088 --> 07:03.556
Good to see you again, Zed.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.636
Been so long, I almost
didn't think you were real.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.312
Glad I didn't dream you up.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.559
(Constantine) 'Oh, this
is, this is beautiful.'

07:10.764 --> 07:12.266
Lovely. Really, really nice.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.852
But how's about a bit of
a hand over here, eh, big man?

07:16.853 --> 07:18.855
- Yeah.
- I got this.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.156
[whoosh]

07:24.778 --> 07:27.531
Alright, one, two, three.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.992
[grunting]

07:33.662 --> 07:35.756
Yeah.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.630
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it, yeah. Oh!

07:48.802 --> 07:50.679
[clothes ripping]

07:51.930 --> 07:53.432
There you go.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.857
- 'What's that?'
- 'Holy water.'

07:58.061 --> 08:00.905
Good for revealing
ritual markings.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.653
What's it tell us?

08:02.857 --> 08:06.202
Detective Dupree got the
business end of Diaboli Cauter.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.030
The Devil's branding irons.

08:08.238 --> 08:11.492
Used in the 13th century
inquisition to torture witches.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.920
The girls were taken
by a Satanist.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.964
Why? What does he want them for?

08:18.164 --> 08:21.088
A full moon symbolizes rebirth,
but the blood moon..

08:21.292 --> 08:24.637
[sighs] ...most likely sacrifices
to usher in the new cycle.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.967
The station.
I need to take this.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.017
'Corrigan. Talk to me.'

08:31.886 --> 08:33.604
Are you alright, luv?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.356
John! It's me, Gary.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.937
- Gary?
- Hey Zed.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.910
Gary Bloody Lester!

08:47.110 --> 08:49.909
Are you hijacking
corpses now, eh?

08:50.113 --> 08:52.081
- How are you, mate?
- I had to warn you.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.534
I'm all ears, Gaz.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.666
There's a price on your head.
Big bounty on offer.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.338
'I'm sorry, mate.'

09:00.373 --> 09:02.250
(Dwayne)
'I-I didn't mean it, papa.'

09:03.668 --> 09:06.137
'I only wanted to scare her.'

09:06.337 --> 09:08.089
'On my life.'

09:08.298 --> 09:09.971
What about her life?

09:10.175 --> 09:13.270
You murdered the mother
of your children.

09:13.470 --> 09:17.566
A bounty is being offered
for John Constantine.

09:17.766 --> 09:22.067
The man is a con artist,
but not without some skill.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.697
To collect this bounty

09:24.898 --> 09:28.573
I require something... special.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.156
If you agree to assist.

09:33.364 --> 09:36.208
Whatever it takes, I'll do it.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.372
[bird cawing]

09:46.002 --> 09:48.300
A life for a life.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.758
[screaming]

09:57.597 --> 10:00.100
[panting]

10:04.270 --> 10:07.149
[intense music]

10:30.046 --> 10:31.423
Come in.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.473
'When I called Missing Persons'

10:32.674 --> 10:33.891
'they said it might be a while'

10:34.092 --> 10:36.561
'before anyone came,
but here y'all are.'

10:36.761 --> 10:37.933
- Mrs. Whitney...
- 'Anna Kate.'

10:38.138 --> 10:39.310
Just Anna Kate, please.

10:39.514 --> 10:41.437
I can't hear that
other name no more.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.858
Your married name?

10:43.059 --> 10:45.778
My ex-husband's the reason
why Vesta's gone now.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.323
She loved him to pieces.

10:48.523 --> 10:50.196
Don't rightly know why.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.277
"Cause he ain't
never paid her no mind.'"

10:52.485 --> 10:54.408
Well, almost all girls
love their fathers.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.159
'No matter what they do.'

10:57.282 --> 10:59.034
[flies buzzing]

10:59.242 --> 11:00.915
[coughs]

11:12.005 --> 11:13.507
[gasps]

11:20.054 --> 11:21.806
(Amberly) 'Look at you.'

11:22.015 --> 11:26.816
Prettier than butter melting
on a stack of wheat cakes.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.239
I don't know where I am.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.362
I can't remember
when I got here.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.364
Sometimes when I wake up

11:33.568 --> 11:35.616
I can't tell
if it's real or a dream.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.663
You were so tired
when we got back.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.036
You never even told us
your name.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.745
Vesta.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.421
It's Vesta Whitney.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.920
What a pretty name.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.218
Why don't you
come along now, Vesta.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.670
[chuckles]

11:57.425 --> 11:58.927
- 'Any visions?'
- Nothing.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.061
I'm not getting anything.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.437
There's no need to force it,
luv.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.486
Take a break,
we'll roll the dice again later.

12:10.271 --> 12:13.491
Maybe I'm not as comfortable
gambling as you seem to be.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.238
Is there something on your mind,
luv?

12:15.443 --> 12:17.491
Are you going to roll the dice
on Gary's warning, too?

12:17.695 --> 12:18.571
Just wait and see what turns up?

12:18.780 --> 12:21.408
Yeah. Sounds reasonable.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.243
You can't ignore the warnings,
John.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.624
Oh, every time I light up,
I have the surgeon general

12:25.828 --> 12:28.832
harping on about bloody
lung cancer, and look at me.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.758
- Fit as a fiddle.
- What's your point?

12:30.959 --> 12:33.303
My point is we can all
shape our destiny

12:33.503 --> 12:36.552
but none of us
get to escape our fate.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.929
'So when my time's up,
that's it.'

12:39.092 --> 12:41.891
Now, what is really
going on here, Zed?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.768
'What are you hiding?'

12:43.972 --> 12:46.566
I saw Jim dead.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.018
In my vision.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.352
(Corrigafl) 'Hey.'

12:51.145 --> 12:53.864
Think I got all I could
from Anna Kate.

12:54.065 --> 12:57.035
What about here?

12:57.235 --> 12:58.828
Turn anything up? Any, um..

12:59.028 --> 13:00.530
- Visions. No.
- Right.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.241
Visions are out of service
until further notice.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.337
[sighs]

13:08.538 --> 13:09.710
It's the darnedest thing.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.507
I knowed I came in here
for something

13:11.708 --> 13:13.756
but for the life of me,
I can't remember why.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.712
Happens to me all the time.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.137
Just keep looking.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.011
I'm sure you'll find
whatever you need.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.976
[whoosh]

13:22.176 --> 13:23.644
Sound advice.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.521
Manny. What are you doing here?

13:28.725 --> 13:31.103
John says you never come
when he calls.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.109
He doesn't ask as nicely as you.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.362
[laughs]
But I didn't call for you.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.910
Are you sure?

13:39.110 --> 13:40.862
Zed, you communicate
on a different level

13:41.070 --> 13:45.371
than most mortals,
more like a spiritual being.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.169
You felt my need.
That's what called to you.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.212
It's part of your gift.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.461
But you look like
you're under the weight

13:52.665 --> 13:55.794
of a curse at the moment.

13:56.002 --> 14:00.178
I-I had a vision of a friend.
He's going to die.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.304
I don't know ifl can change that

14:02.508 --> 14:05.762
but I can at least warn him.
I just don't know if I should.

14:07.805 --> 14:11.275
I envy you. Truly.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.104
You know, it's not
all harps and halos for us

14:14.312 --> 14:15.814
we have rules to follow.

14:16.022 --> 14:19.151
But you, you have choices.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.863
You can act on your visions
if you choose to.

14:23.071 --> 14:26.371
Now, that's a gift.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.918
Tell me something, Zed Martin.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.089
You like pickles?

14:35.625 --> 14:36.501
I love pickles.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.551
[whoosh]

14:37.752 --> 14:40.471
Of course. Pickles.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.264
How'd you know?

14:42.465 --> 14:44.138
It's a gift, apparently.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.100
Alright, alright, alright.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.527
You mind telling me
what you're doing?

14:58.731 --> 15:02.827
Eh, little bit of your job,
and, uh, little bit of hers.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.029
You, uh, don't happen to have
a Taser, do you?

15:06.155 --> 15:07.498
- Mm-mm.
- Right.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.372
Uh.. Ah, this should do it.

15:14.163 --> 15:17.042
[speaking in Tibetan]

15:22.171 --> 15:23.093
Ah.

15:33.933 --> 15:34.980
John!

15:35.184 --> 15:37.687
[grunting]

15:37.895 --> 15:39.738
[electricity crackling]

15:48.364 --> 15:50.458
John! Hey! Hey! Crazy!

15:50.658 --> 15:52.160
You're gonna kill yourself!

15:52.368 --> 15:53.790
[sighs]

15:53.995 --> 15:54.962
[groans]

15:55.163 --> 15:57.086
[gags]

15:57.290 --> 15:59.759
[sighs] If there was any other way,
luv, I would've tried it, trust me

15:59.959 --> 16:02.303
but, uh,
desperate times and all.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.380
What did you do?

16:04.589 --> 16:06.808
Tibetans call it
piercing the veil.

16:07.008 --> 16:10.729
DNA, the right words,
a dash of cardiac arrest

16:10.928 --> 16:13.522
and it gets you
into the bardo state.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.817
Allows you to connect
with the subject's spirit.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.400
And? What'd you see?

16:19.604 --> 16:21.322
I saw through her eyes.

16:21.522 --> 16:24.196
She went outside,
down the street, and then..

16:28.738 --> 16:30.490
I know where she was taken from.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.958
The Man's mama wore that very
dress the day she got married.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.761
- Ain't it beautiful?
- It's real pretty.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.804
'You wore it
when you got married?'

16:46.005 --> 16:47.803
We all done.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.680
My mama's wedding gown is..

16:52.178 --> 16:53.646
My mama,
she don't know where I'm at.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.018
When you're married to The Man

16:55.223 --> 16:57.567
you don't have to
worry about nobody.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.360
Won't she be worried?

16:59.560 --> 17:02.484
She'll be proud of you,
becoming a woman and all.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.823
Maybe she could come.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.076
Might make her real happy.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.954
We'd just have to do something
about the smell, is all.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.001
I'm-I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.632
- 'I didn't mean to offend you.'
- It don't matter.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.804
Besides, you won't even
notice it once you're married.

17:28.714 --> 17:29.681
'I promise.'

17:29.882 --> 17:30.929
[chuckles]

17:35.471 --> 17:37.189
[bird cawing]

17:40.351 --> 17:42.399
[growling]

17:45.648 --> 17:46.820
Rete!

17:51.737 --> 17:55.742
You took a life,
you paid for it with your own.

17:55.950 --> 17:59.329
But now the Loa has seen fit
to give you another.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.629
[growling]

18:00.830 --> 18:02.503
Don't waste it.

18:05.835 --> 18:10.682
Consider this dust the essence
of Constantine's life.

18:10.881 --> 18:14.351
Breathe it in.
Connect to his energy.

18:14.552 --> 18:19.774
You exist now
for one purpose only.

18:19.974 --> 18:24.104
Reduce John Constantine's
life to dust.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.951
[growling]

18:36.490 --> 18:39.369
[intense music]

18:47.168 --> 18:48.886
No sign of anyone.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.050
Car looks like it could've been
here all night.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.260
Maybe the driver saw something
he wasn't meant to.

18:58.679 --> 18:59.851
Hey.

19:02.183 --> 19:03.901
Everything okay with you?

19:05.394 --> 19:08.022
I mean, these kind of cases,
they can be rough.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.153
I'm fine.

19:10.358 --> 19:13.202
Alright. Just..

19:13.402 --> 19:15.075
Just know that
you can talk to me.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.201
About anything.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.453
You remember how to do that,
right?

19:18.658 --> 19:21.002
- Yeah.
- Talk to me?

19:21.160 --> 19:24.664
'Cause right now

19:24.872 --> 19:26.419
seems like
you can't even look at me.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.420
[whoosh]

19:31.629 --> 19:32.972
Zed?

19:33.172 --> 19:35.300
Maybe we should catch up
with John.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.222
[birds chirping]

19:41.430 --> 19:44.274
[intense music]

20:11.043 --> 20:12.636
[growling]

20:12.837 --> 20:15.056
[grunting]

20:19.635 --> 20:23.265
(Papa Midnite's voice) Constantine,
look into those dead eyes before you.

20:23.472 --> 20:27.693
I want you to understand killing
you brings me no real joy.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.817
However, we do what we must!

20:31.021 --> 20:32.273
[grunts]

20:36.902 --> 20:38.028

20:57.757 --> 21:00.556
- Ah, give me a hand, will you?
- 'What the hell was that?'

21:00.760 --> 21:01.807
[grunts]

21:02.011 --> 21:03.854
[panting]

21:04.889 --> 21:07.438
It's a voodoo zombie.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.018
Looks like Papa Midnite
has decided

21:09.226 --> 21:10.978
'to try and collect the bounty,
and he'll be back.'

21:11.187 --> 21:14.157
No more pissing about,
we need to find that girl, fast.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.450
'I need you to push past'

21:16.650 --> 21:19.028
'any distractions
you might have.'

21:19.236 --> 21:21.489
'You need a vision. Do it.'

21:23.282 --> 21:24.625
I'll try.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.870
[Zed clears throat]

21:37.338 --> 21:38.430
I see blood.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.100
Widen your lens.
We need an address.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.974
[intense music]

21:54.021 --> 21:55.898
[groaning]

22:04.031 --> 22:06.204
There-there was, there was a man
and he was trying to

22:06.408 --> 22:08.285
tell me something,
I need, uh, something to write.

22:08.494 --> 22:09.916
A Pen and paper.

22:10.913 --> 22:13.792
[instrumental music]

22:32.309 --> 22:33.356
Here we go.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.488
We have an address.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.613
Oh, yes, we do.
Alright, let's go.

22:42.987 --> 22:45.866
[instrumental music]

22:49.660 --> 22:51.162
[crow cawing]

[blows]

23:07.845 --> 23:09.392
Be my eyes.

23:09.597 --> 23:12.271
Find John Constantine.

23:22.026 --> 23:25.405
[birds chirping]

23:25.613 --> 23:27.741
Your visions,
they always come true?

23:29.617 --> 23:31.290
Not as simple as that, Jimbo.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.747
Sometimes they're abstract,
they need to be interpreted.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.798
I just mean,
have they ever failed?

23:40.920 --> 23:42.092
Neven

You sure look purty.'

25:28.110 --> 25:29.908
(Zed) Dios mio.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.615
(Constantine) I'm guessing this
is our missing security guard.

25:32.823 --> 25:36.077
We're too late for him.
We wasted valuable time.

25:36.285 --> 25:39.004
Not wasted.
He deserved to be found as well.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.582
And I think it might have given
us our first real breakthrough.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.758
I know this area.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.882
Only one way in and out.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.134
Traffic cam records it all.

25:48.338 --> 25:49.806
[crow caws]

25:52.885 --> 25:55.638
You two need to leave here
right now.

25:55.846 --> 25:58.975
There's trouble brewing here and
I can't risk it following us.

25:59.183 --> 26:00.105
What kind of trouble?

26:00.309 --> 26:02.607
The bounty hunter kind. Go, now.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.154
I'll sort this
and call you later.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.607
- You don't even have a phone.
- Just go. Now.

26:15.157 --> 26:16.875
Keep her safe.

[instrumental music]

26:53.487 --> 26:55.205
Oh, yeah.

26:57.616 --> 27:01.541
You might be the prettiest
peeshwank I ever done see.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.168
What your name is, boo?

27:04.373 --> 27:07.627
- Vesta.
- Vesta.

27:07.835 --> 27:10.338
I like that.

27:10.546 --> 27:13.425
J'ain gros couer, Vesta.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.679
What does that mean?

27:17.386 --> 27:19.684
This here, a right big heart.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.227
I feel like cryin'.

27:27.688 --> 27:30.737
You gonna marry me?
Stay forever?

27:33.277 --> 27:34.449
Yes.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.325
C'est magnifique.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.168
Come now, Vesta.

[gun cocks]

28:51.813 --> 28:53.110
You finally did it.

28:53.315 --> 28:56.615
You traded
your last thread of honor.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.661
For a lousy, bloody bounty.

28:58.862 --> 29:02.116
Your next words will be
your last, Constantine.

29:02.324 --> 29:03.291
Choose them wisely.

29:03.492 --> 29:06.166
[panting]
There's a girl out there

29:06.370 --> 29:07.917
with a depraved killer.

29:08.121 --> 29:10.123
'I'm her only chance of rescue.'

29:10.332 --> 29:12.926
Can any bounty..

29:13.126 --> 29:15.470
Be worth that stain
on your soul?

29:15.671 --> 29:18.641
I gave up on my soul
a long time ago.

29:18.840 --> 29:23.562
I'm sorry for the girl,
but yes, the bounty is worth it.

29:23.762 --> 29:27.687
Your sacrifice
will free my sister's soul

29:27.891 --> 29:30.144
from eternal damnation.

29:30.352 --> 29:32.855
'A life for a life.'

29:33.063 --> 29:36.317
No one has that kind of power.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.825
[chuckles] Except the Brujeria.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.702
It seems you have angered them,
John.

29:42.906 --> 29:46.206
- Not your smartest move.
- Apparently not.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.663
If not me, someone else
would've collected.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.924
Who would dare deny them?

29:53.125 --> 29:55.878
I don't suppose, uh..

29:56.086 --> 29:57.178
I can tempt you with a counter..

29:57.379 --> 29:58.847
[gunshot]

30:07.889 --> 30:11.439
You're not the only one
that can reanimate a corpse.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.271
I just added a glamour spell.
Nifty, eh?

30:14.479 --> 30:15.856
You'd better kill me,
Constantine.

30:16.064 --> 30:16.940
Oh, shut it.

30:22.279 --> 30:23.576
Ta for that.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.534
[cell phone rings]

30:27.743 --> 30:29.086
- Hello?
- 'Hey, all sorted.'

30:29.286 --> 30:32.005
How about you,
you got an address?

30:32.205 --> 30:35.049
Jim checked the traffic cameras.
They got a hit.

30:35.250 --> 30:39.175
A guy killed his wife six years
ago on their wedding night.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.881
He claimed
Satan told him to do it

30:41.089 --> 30:44.343
because, apparently, she wasn't
the virgin bride he deserved.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.474
Well, that sounds like our man.
Text the address to this phone.

30:46.678 --> 30:47.679
I'll meet you there.

30:47.888 --> 30:50.061

Protector of the damned

30:50.265 --> 30:52.814

30:53.018 --> 30:56.067
between you servant
and his bride.

30:59.399 --> 31:02.198
Time for the devil's
benediction.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.575
Kneel down.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.578
I don't want to do this.

31:06.782 --> 31:09.251
Don't make the misere.
Kneel down, now.

31:11.495 --> 31:12.838
Come on.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.967
That's it.

31:21.963 --> 31:24.261
It's time to get you
wedding ring.

31:25.384 --> 31:28.012
No!

31:28.220 --> 31:30.097
Aw, now.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.524

34:16.304 --> 34:17.476
- Oh!
- Damn it, John.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.603
Nearly got your
head blown clean off.

34:19.808 --> 34:20.855
(Zed) You okay?

34:27.357 --> 34:29.324
Hey, hey, hey-

34:29.525 --> 34:30.947
Mine's bigger.

34:49.629 --> 34:53.007
- Oh, I knowed I'd find you!
- No! No. Please.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.935
You mine now. Forever.

34:56.136 --> 34:57.979
Until death do us part.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.726
I promise you that.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.899
Come on. We're going home.

35:08.481 --> 35:09.778
(Constantine) Let her go.

You okay, sweetie? Come on.

[grunts]

35:44.142 --> 35:46.144
Tell me.

35:46.353 --> 35:48.447
What would happen
if a man like this

35:48.647 --> 35:51.321
after everything he's done,
all the children he's

35:51.524 --> 35:53.993
murdered, what would happen
if he were to

35:54.194 --> 35:55.571
try and run away?

35:56.988 --> 35:58.865
He ain't no demon,
ain't no ghost.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.543
- He's a man.
- A man?

36:03.870 --> 36:04.792

Come on. Let's go.

36:40.824 --> 36:43.543
[speaking in foreign language]

37:04.806 --> 37:06.353
[indistinct radio chatter]

37:12.564 --> 37:14.862
Do you believe in fate?

37:15.066 --> 37:18.821
[chuckles] I don't know.

37:19.028 --> 37:21.702
I guess I just think
what's meant to be will be.

37:26.161 --> 37:27.959
I saw you dead.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.632
You asked me before
if my visions always come true.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.169
And I saw you dead.

37:37.714 --> 37:40.433
That's why you couldn't
look at me.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.970
I didn't know
if I should tell you.

37:43.178 --> 37:45.681
Who wants the burden
of that knowledge?

37:45.889 --> 37:47.766
What made you change your mind?

37:47.974 --> 37:49.601
I realized you deserve to know.

37:49.809 --> 37:50.776
[chuckles]

37:50.977 --> 37:52.979
It was my responsibility
to tell you.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.859
I don't know

37:58.067 --> 38:02.447
When it's going to happen,
where.

38:02.655 --> 38:05.499
I don't even know if there's
anything we can do to change it.

38:08.244 --> 38:09.496
I'm really sorry, Jim.

38:12.832 --> 38:13.879
If I'm gonna die..

38:16.544 --> 38:18.512
I'm gonna make
every moment count.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.765
[whoosh]

39:10.974 --> 39:13.818
Be an angel. Come over here
and hold it for me, will you?

39:16.813 --> 39:18.565
You know, you're like a blister.

39:18.773 --> 39:22.323
You only turn up
when the hard work's done.

39:22.527 --> 39:23.995
(Manny) I've been around.

39:27.949 --> 39:30.953
You spent time with Zed today,
didn't you?

39:31.160 --> 39:32.958
Oh, I feel betrayed.

39:33.162 --> 39:35.415
I didn't realize
we were seeing other people now.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.296
Oh. Come on, John.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.128
You and I both know
she is not other people.

39:40.336 --> 39:41.679
You're right.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.804
Seems we're not the only ones
who think that.

39:45.008 --> 39:48.763
Jim Corrigan. You're jealous.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.940
You know, I've learned to handle
it when people around me die.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.357
I've had plenty of practice.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.356
Let's just hope that
she's strong enough.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.688
That's not what's really
troubling you though, is it?

39:59.772 --> 40:02.946
I stare into the face of evil
every bloody day.

40:03.151 --> 40:05.700
It usually manifests itself
as a demon

40:05.904 --> 40:08.999
a malevolent spirit,
a bloody zombie, but now..

40:09.198 --> 40:12.498
John, you've encountered
human evil before.

40:12.702 --> 40:16.002
I have, but this is
something else entirely.

40:16.205 --> 40:18.674
We now know what happens
when the rising darkness

40:18.875 --> 40:21.424
meets the worst of humanity.

40:21.628 --> 40:24.882
There's not an evil in any realm
more bloody dangerous than that.

40:30.011 --> 40:33.936
This thing that we've set out
to do, you and I

40:34.098 --> 40:36.192
it's working.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.895
We can win this war.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.650
Trust me.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.108
Huh.

40:43.316 --> 40:45.910
Of course we can.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.987
You know me.

40:48.196 --> 40:51.040
I don't play if I can't win.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.959
All I'm worried about is
how to spend the rest of my days

40:54.118 --> 40:57.042
after I've driven
every last bastard demon

40:57.246 --> 40:59.089
back to where it belongs.

41:00.375 --> 41:03.254
[instrumental music]

41:18.017 --> 41:20.190
Where's my lawyer, I told you,
I'm not saying anything

41:20.395 --> 41:22.363
until I see my lawyer.

41:23.439 --> 41:24.816
What is this?

41:33.116 --> 41:34.959
Who is it?

41:35.159 --> 41:37.628
Who's there? Reveal yourself.

41:37.829 --> 41:40.582
You're in no position
to be making demands.

41:40.790 --> 41:43.088
Who... who are you?

41:43.292 --> 41:44.965
Your savior.

41:51.134 --> 41:53.478
So that's it?

41:53.678 --> 41:55.897
I'm free now? What's the catch?

41:56.097 --> 41:58.441
You'll never be free.

41:58.641 --> 41:59.938
You gave up any hope of that

42:00.143 --> 42:02.942
when you went to work
for the Brujeria.

42:03.146 --> 42:04.523
What do you want?

42:04.731 --> 42:07.450
I'm cancelling the contract
on John Constantine.

42:07.650 --> 42:10.324
You understand? He's off-limits.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.825
You work for the Brujeria?

42:15.033 --> 42:17.001
No.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.044
The Brujeria work for me.
