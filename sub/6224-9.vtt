WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:04.250
Narrator: In a land of myth...

00:04.421 --> 00:05.877
And a time of magic...

00:06.048 --> 00:07.879
The destiny of a great kingdom...

00:08.050 --> 00:11.042
Rests on the shoulders of a young man.

00:11.220 --> 00:14.178
His name, Merlin.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.290
Man: You there

00:48.590 --> 00:50.296
show yourself.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.506
Your highness?

00:55.681 --> 00:57.387
Are you all right? Is something wrong?

00:57.558 --> 00:59.298
No, no. All is well.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.467
It's dangerous to be out at such an hour.

01:02.104 --> 01:04.811
I'm grateful you are so scrupulous
in your duties.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.439
It's not where I thought to have found you,
your highness.

01:09.319 --> 01:12.106
One doesn't always wish
to be your highness, percival.

01:12.864 --> 01:16.448
I miss the old town. Its
streets, its people.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.358
So I go back sometimes.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.902
Is that wise?

01:20.831 --> 01:23.664
Well, people only see a queen
when they expect to.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.326
- All the same...
- And it reminds me of elyan.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.332
And I need that sometimes.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.004
Of course.

01:36.305 --> 01:37.670
I understand.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.676
I'm not sure Arthur would.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.761
I won't mention it.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.385
Thank you.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.192
Morgana: You're late.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.448
Gwen: I'm sorry.
Morgana: Was there a problem?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.325
Nothing I couldn't handle.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.985
Did you get what I asked for?

02:03.373 --> 02:05.159
It wasn't easy.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.334
It details the route
the Levy collection will take.

02:07.502 --> 02:11.711
The names of the knights, their arms,
and the day they depart.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.914
Morgana: You've done well, Gwen.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.341
Gwen:
How can I further our cause?

02:22.309 --> 02:24.095
No, my lord.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.351
Morgana's too powerful. Now's not the time.

02:26.521 --> 02:29.263
- How could she do this?
- She's not the Gwen you love.

02:29.441 --> 02:32.353
She's fallen prey to a dark
and powerful magic.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.727
If I lose her, I lose everything.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.948
We'll find a way to bring her back, Arthur.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.613
I promise.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.323
I thought I might ride this morning.

03:24.746 --> 03:28.364
- Yes?
- Would you like to join me?

03:30.127 --> 03:32.163
That won't be possible.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.244
Oh, perhaps this afternoon then.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.422
Perhaps.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.626
Arthur, is everything all right?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.296
What do you mean?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.806
You seem distracted.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.388
Not at all

03:50.355 --> 03:53.643
pressing matters of state.
That's all. I'm sorry.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.307
I understand.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.143
Is there anything I can help you with?

04:01.199 --> 04:03.155
Won't be necessary.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.412
You've hardly eaten.

04:13.587 --> 04:17.250
- I have a training session I must attend.
- Well, perhaps I'll see you later.

04:28.894 --> 04:32.134
Arthur: Gentlemen, this is the new route
to collect the Levy. Commit it to memory.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.752
Mordred: My lord. Arthur: Tell
no one of the change of plans...

04:34.900 --> 04:37.266
- Until the patrol's on its way. Understood?
- Sire.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.105
Mordred?

04:39.279 --> 04:42.396
Of course, but may I ask why
we're changing the route, my lord?

04:42.574 --> 04:44.934
- This is another day's ride.
Arthur: I can't tell you that.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.692
I just ask you trust me.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.362
Good. We leave in three days.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.249
Merlin:
Why did I promise to help Gwen?

04:58.882 --> 05:01.419
I have no idea what to do.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.046
Is there really no remedy?

05:04.930 --> 05:09.549
If Gwen has suffered what I suspect,
then no, I fear not.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.802
You know what happened to her.

05:15.023 --> 05:18.686
When I was young I heard talk
of an ancient ritual of the old religion...

05:18.860 --> 05:21.021
Called the teine diaga.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.695
Teine diaga?

05:23.865 --> 05:25.355
Gaius: The sacred fire.

05:25.534 --> 05:30.699
The ritual used the mandrake root
to bring unimaginable terror to the victim.

05:30.872 --> 05:34.785
Their screams could be heard
20 leagues away.

05:35.877 --> 05:40.962
When it was finally over,
their will was no longer their own.

05:41.842 --> 05:45.209
They were slaves of the high priestesses
for eternity.

05:45.387 --> 05:48.720
- Who performed this ritual? Where?
- I've told you all I know.

05:48.890 --> 05:52.053
Such mysteries were revealed
only to a handful of female initiates.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.843
As a boy, I was privy only to rumors.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.268
There must be someone who can help.

05:58.441 --> 06:03.060
I could think of only two people
who truly know the old ways.

06:03.780 --> 06:07.238
One is morgana pendragon.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.699
The other is the dochraid.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.158
But be warned, Merlin.

06:18.336 --> 06:21.794
The dochraid cannot be trusted.

06:24.384 --> 06:28.673
She must never know your true identity.

06:35.312 --> 06:39.396
Who dares enter the sacred cave?

06:39.566 --> 06:43.479
I come to petition the dochraid.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.111
Give me your hand.

07:05.300 --> 07:09.259
- I smell the stench of enmity.
- I come in peace.

07:09.429 --> 07:14.048
- In friendship.
- You are no friend of the old religion.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.012
No friend of morgana pendragon.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.644
- Great dochraid...
- Silence!

07:19.814 --> 07:22.897
I know you, emrys.

07:23.068 --> 07:26.652
Your queen will find no relief here.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.689
How do you know why I come? “Ah

07:30.867 --> 07:33.950
I am the dochraid.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.532
The earth speaks to me.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.322
You are not welcome here.

07:39.501 --> 07:42.868
- Depart!
- Oh, I cannot do that.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.582
Ahh.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.292
Not until I have what I came for.

07:47.926 --> 07:52.716
You dare challenge me,
the ancient dochraid?

07:52.889 --> 07:56.052
You, a puny sorcerer?

07:56.226 --> 08:00.014
And yet I will have what I came for.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.268
Hmm.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.976
I'm a creature of the earth.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.142
You cannot kill me.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.614
This sword

08:21.459 --> 08:24.075
was forged in a dragon's breath.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.540
And it will do my bidding.

08:26.715 --> 08:31.209
You do not have the power
to wield such a weapon.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.851
I wish you no further harm, dochraid.
Tell me what I need to know.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.263
Your queen is doomed, emrys.

08:44.441 --> 08:48.275
Her spirit has been consumed
by the teine diaga.

08:48.445 --> 08:51.903
Bound by the silver wheel for all eternity.

08:52.073 --> 08:57.989
Her body is nothing but an empty vessel
filled by the will of another.

08:58.663 --> 08:59.663
Morgana.

08:59.831 --> 09:04.996
Once she has served her purpose,
then that too will be cast away.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.285
How do I break this spell?

09:07.464 --> 09:11.457
Only the greatest of sorcerers
could attempt such a thing.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.385
- How?
- Ugh.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.390
You must travel
to the cauldron of arianrhod.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.973
There you will need all of your powers...

09:24.147 --> 09:28.732
For you must summon
the white goddess herself.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.236
And that is all?

09:34.407 --> 09:36.773
No, emrys.

09:36.951 --> 09:40.489
The queen must enter the cauldron.

09:40.663 --> 09:44.326
Its waters hold the goddess's power.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.334
Only their touch can heal her.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.836
Remember, emrys...

09:51.007 --> 09:54.591
The queen must enter
the water willingly.

09:54.761 --> 09:58.800
If she is tricked, forced, or beguiled...

09:58.973 --> 10:02.056
She will fall into the abyss...

10:02.560 --> 10:05.768
And be lost forever.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.483
Thank you, great dochraid.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.565
Thank you.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.597
Sire?

10:46.771 --> 10:49.934
- Is all well?
- Yes, thank you.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.939
If there's anything I can do?

10:52.110 --> 10:53.145
Sorry?

10:54.237 --> 10:57.320
Just wanted you to know
I'm always at your service.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.572
I never doubted it, mordred.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.255
Merlin:
There are too many things to go wrong.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.532
And summoning the white goddess?

11:08.710 --> 11:10.951
- That may be beyond me.
- I think not.

11:11.129 --> 11:14.041
Merlin, the only person
who ever doubts your powers is you.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.799
And even if I do manage that, we need to get
Gwen to the cauldron in the first place.

11:17.969 --> 11:21.427
- And she's hardly likely to go willingly.
- I've already thought of that.

11:31.524 --> 11:35.016
- Tincture of belladonna.
- All that studying has paid off.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.437
It's a powerful and dangerous drug, Gaius.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.448
More dangerous than a traitor
in the heart of Camelot?

11:41.618 --> 11:43.818
Gwen needs to be conscious
when she enters the cauldron.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.633
She must do so of her own free will
or the spell will not be broken.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.280
That I agree may not
be within our powers.

11:49.459 --> 11:53.247
- Well then, the rest is futile.
- But there is someone for whom it is possible.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.045
Arthur?

11:56.758 --> 12:01.218
Only he can reach the part of Gwen
that remains true.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.752
Won't work.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.468
You underestimate the
power of love, Merlin.

12:05.642 --> 12:09.931
No, not that. Me.
How can I use my magic with Arthur there?

12:10.104 --> 12:12.390
He'd discover me in an instant.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.476
Not if he didn't recognize you.

12:14.651 --> 12:17.313
Heh, no.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.818
No. Not again.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.777
You know how exhausting
the aging spell is, Gaius.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.784
I don't have the strength to do that
and perform the ceremony.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.747
Then you must find the strength.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.283
Arthur: This tincture of belladonna,
what are its effects?

12:35.421 --> 12:39.005
- Patient is rendered into a deep sleep...
- Patient?

12:39.175 --> 12:41.507
It is generally used for the badly wounded.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.343
How long does it last?
A few hours.

12:45.056 --> 12:49.550
It has to be administered several times
a day to provide a continuous sleep.

12:49.727 --> 12:53.390
- But for no more than three days.
- It is true, sire.

12:53.564 --> 12:57.398
The tincture should not be taken
for an extended period.

12:57.568 --> 12:58.853
Or?

13:02.699 --> 13:05.156
The body will not tolerate it.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.203
Thank you, Merlin.

13:08.371 --> 13:12.159
Three days is time enough
to ride to the cauldron of arianrhod.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.933
- You've done the journey yourself, have you?
- I cannot claim to.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.039
Any mishap, any unexpected circumstance...

13:17.213 --> 13:20.831
There is no reason to suspect
that all will not go well.

13:25.847 --> 13:31.342
My lord, if we do nothing,
Gwen is already taken from you.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.895
Merlin?

13:42.697 --> 13:44.779
Summoning this goddess...

13:45.491 --> 13:47.027
Will it require magic?

13:48.244 --> 13:51.736
It is a ritual that can only
be performed by a sorcerer.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.908
It is the only way, sire.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.461
Sorcery has to be fought with sorcery.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.206
I'll be breaking my own decrees.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.342
To save your queen. To save your wife.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.851
Very well.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.392
It's decided.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.850
There'll be a sorcerer. Can he be trusted?

14:26.157 --> 14:28.068
Upon my life.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.779
You assured me so once before, Gaius.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.239
Then my father died
in the hands of such a man.

14:33.414 --> 14:37.498
- This sorcerer will be entirely different.
- How can you be sure?

14:38.002 --> 14:43.087
Because sire, this time, I have chosen...

14:46.219 --> 14:47.629
A woman.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.067
How was the training, my lord?

15:09.283 --> 15:10.693
Fine.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.075
Did you win, lose?

15:13.621 --> 15:15.486
Little of both.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.789
You're a terrible liar, Arthur.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.246
You're wearing the same clothes
you were this morning...

15:21.421 --> 15:23.833
And your armor remains untouched.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.255
I'm not a fool.

15:27.093 --> 15:30.051
Wherever you've been,
it wasn't the training ground.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.462
- I, um...
- Have I done something wrong?

15:33.724 --> 15:37.057
Spoken out of turn,
said something I shouldn't?

15:37.228 --> 15:41.767
I'm your wife, Arthur.
I wouldn't see you hurt for the world.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.315
Now tell me, what's troubling you?

15:51.909 --> 15:54.150
I love you, Guinevere,
more than you can imagine.

15:55.580 --> 15:59.573
There isn't anything
I would not do for you.

16:00.543 --> 16:02.204
I know.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.467
What do you think?

16:16.684 --> 16:18.299
Gaius: Ah

16:18.478 --> 16:21.436
- it quite suits you, actually.
- Heh

16:21.606 --> 16:23.938
- thanks.
- You're forgetting one thing.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.191
I think it needs a belt.

16:29.280 --> 16:35.116
Remember, you have to administer two drops
every two hours to keep Gwen asleep.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.493
Do you really think we can succeed, Gaius?

16:37.663 --> 16:39.494
We must.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.630
- Wine, my lady.
- Not tonight. Thanks, Merlin.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.220
A toast

16:57.642 --> 16:59.098
my lord?

16:59.268 --> 17:01.224
Toast to...

17:01.395 --> 17:02.805
A toast to the queen.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.471
Me? What have I done?

17:08.653 --> 17:10.608
Just being yourself, your highness.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.317
Very kind, Gaius,
but shouldn't it rather be

17:13.491 --> 17:15.527
- to Camelot?
- To Camelot, yes.

17:15.701 --> 17:16.816
Gaius: Camelot. - Camelot.

17:16.993 --> 17:17.993
Gwen: To Camelot.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.841
You haven't eaten, my lord. No.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.435
I haven't

17:45.439 --> 17:48.431
- you're sure this is safe, Gaius?
- I'd stake my life on it, sire.

17:48.609 --> 17:49.940
You may have to.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.405
- She's still a queen.
- It's the best I could do.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.237
Gaius: We have to hurry, sire.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.826
Careful

18:05.042 --> 18:06.373
there.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.660
- No one will know.
- You're sure this is gonna work?

18:08.838 --> 18:11.375
You'd be amazed how much license
old age lends you, sire.

18:11.549 --> 18:14.086
Merlin, come.
We meet at the docking wood.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.842
- Merlin, if you drop her...
- I know. I lose my head.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.004
Just so we're clear.

18:24.687 --> 18:27.554
Gaius:
Uh, keep up, boy. Keep up.

18:28.316 --> 18:31.274
Why I keep him is beyond me.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.769
Are you all right?
She's 3 lot heavier than she looks.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.529
- That might very well be grounds for treason.
- Oh, no.

18:39.368 --> 18:42.326
Gaius and Merlin.
And a barrow of linen.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.158
- Sir Gwaine, sir mordred.
- Planning on changing a bed?

18:45.333 --> 18:48.541
- Or perhaps to run up some clothes?
- Don't touch that!

18:48.711 --> 18:51.669
Not unless you want to risk an attack
of red thrush fever.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.546
- I've never heard of it.
- Ah, and you're fortunate indeed.

18:54.717 --> 18:59.086
More fortunate than the young man
who's just died in these very bed clothes.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.799
They have to be burned immediately.

19:00.973 --> 19:05.262
The last thing Camelot needs is an
outbreak of red thrush fever, is it not?

19:05.436 --> 19:08.599
Yes. Of course. Sorry.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.775
Gaius? Sire?

19:14.945 --> 19:17.277
What is the name
of the unfortunate young man?

19:17.448 --> 19:20.155
So that I may send something to his family.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.066
Timothy.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.879
- Where's Merlin?
- It's all right, sire. He comes.

19:43.891 --> 19:44.971
What kept you?

19:45.142 --> 19:49.727
Do you have any idea
how steep those slopes are?

19:56.070 --> 19:57.981
She looks so innocent and perfect.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.440
Gaius: She still is, sire.

19:59.615 --> 20:03.608
The only evil in her is morgana's.
Come. You must be on your way.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.333
Merlin: The sorceress lives
at the westernmost peak.

20:58.507 --> 21:02.671
That would be the highest.
Always is, isn't it?

21:03.554 --> 21:05.545
Better get started then.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.846
Wait

21:12.021 --> 21:13.727
we're being watched.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.104
One of your funny feelings again?

21:23.574 --> 21:25.439
It's all right then.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.834
Tether the horses here.
It'll be quicker on foot.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.082
What about the supplies?

21:43.260 --> 21:45.922
We'll manage.
“We can't take it all

21:46.096 --> 21:47.176
I'll be carrying Guinevere.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.514
Heh, she's half the weight of that lot.

21:50.684 --> 21:54.097
Are you suggesting that I risk the safety
of the queen and carry even more?

21:54.271 --> 21:56.262
I can take her, and...

21:56.440 --> 21:57.520
She's my wife.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.475
- I'd be careful.
- And you're the servant.

22:15.835 --> 22:19.453
- These funny feelings of yours...
- They're not funny.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.461
Stupid then.

22:21.799 --> 22:23.915
Where do they come from, you think”?

22:25.803 --> 22:27.418
You still there, Merlin?

22:27.596 --> 22:29.757
- Don't tell me you've gone into a sulk.
- Ugh.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.676
I'm not sulking.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.263
I'm carrying a load even a horse
would struggle under.

22:34.436 --> 22:35.972
Do you good.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.472
- How come it wouldn't do you good?
- I'm already good.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.356
Well, maybe I...

22:43.737 --> 22:44.852
Merlin?

22:48.367 --> 22:49.777
Merlin?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.950
Merlin!

23:29.199 --> 23:32.487
Emrys is working to thwart your plans.

23:32.661 --> 23:37.621
He means to cleanse Guinevere
at the cauldron of arianrhod.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.122
No

23:48.802 --> 23:51.088
You must help me, aithusa.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.509
This cannot be.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.047
Merlin?

24:29.218 --> 24:30.503
Merlin!

24:56.495 --> 24:58.110
Mordred: Arthur!

25:04.878 --> 25:07.995
- Check on Guinevere.
- I already have, sire.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.788
She sleeps soundly.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.007
Mordred: Doesn't seem possible.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.894
- The queen has the sweetest of natures.
- It was never her.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.472
Just morgana.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.608
I'm sorry I didn't confide in you.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.735
Mordred: It's best you didn't.

25:32.406 --> 25:35.364
If I hadn't had my suspicions,
I wouldn't have followed you.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.242
Merlin acting strangely.

25:38.412 --> 25:41.950
- Is that so unusual?
- And the Levy route being changed.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.249
You had a funny feeling.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.793
My lord?

25:49.840 --> 25:51.171
I'm glad that you did, mordred.

25:51.341 --> 25:54.549
Without you, I fear I would have
lost my arm at the very least.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.678
- I would have woken.
- Merlin, if I had to rely on your timekeeping...

25:57.848 --> 26:00.806
- I'd have lost my arms and my legs to boot.
- Heh, heh.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.641
Arthur:
It's good to have you with us.

26:04.772 --> 26:07.764
Three's always better than two,
isn't that right, Merlin?

26:08.609 --> 26:10.270
Of course.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.154
It's time. “I'll do it.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.238
Two drops only.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.216
You don't trust me do you, Merlin?

26:41.725 --> 26:44.558
I believe you to be a...

26:45.771 --> 26:48.012
A fine knight.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.855
But not one to be trusted.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.146
It's all right.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.562
I know you have the king's
best interests at heart.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.574
I only wish you'd believe that I do too.

27:02.287 --> 27:06.405
One day, I shall prove my loyalty to you
and to the king.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.288
Then I hope we may be friends.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.754
I could wish for nothing more.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.430
Mordred:
What's the meaning of these banners?

27:31.984 --> 27:33.849
Marks the way for pilgrims.

27:34.027 --> 27:36.985
This is a sacred site for those who follow
the old religion.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.568
How do you know such things?

27:40.325 --> 27:42.065
Gaius told me.

27:55.883 --> 27:58.499
- How much further?
- Not far.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.884
This gorge leads to the cauldron.

28:08.312 --> 28:09.722
Herel

28:25.454 --> 28:26.785
Morgana must be close.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.946
You go. I'll distract it. No.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.910
- You must.
- You're the only one...

28:31.084 --> 28:33.040
Who knows where the sorcerer is.
“Arthur!

28:34.421 --> 28:36.082
Mordred:
Get Gwen to safety, sire.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.918
We'll cover you and join you
beyond the gorge.

28:39.927 --> 28:41.007
Very well.

28:43.805 --> 28:46.547
- Stay here. I'll divert the creature.
- Merlin, you can't.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.261
I know what I'm doing, mordred.

29:25.347 --> 29:26.883
What happened?

29:27.516 --> 29:28.551
Merlin

29:28.725 --> 29:30.431
- come on.
- The dragon?

29:30.602 --> 29:32.433
We need to move.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.275
Merlin!

29:49.538 --> 29:51.119
Where's mordred?

29:55.002 --> 29:56.287
No, Arthur.

29:56.461 --> 29:59.248
- I won't leave a knight behind.
- I saw morgana.

30:00.257 --> 30:02.999
Mordred's given us a chance.
We can't throw it away.

30:22.738 --> 30:24.194
Why don't you kill me?

30:24.364 --> 30:26.104
My argument's not with you, mordred.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.441
How could it be?

30:28.618 --> 30:30.483
We're of a kind.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.868
Never.

30:36.043 --> 30:39.206
You wear the uniform well,
but we both know what lies beneath.

30:39.379 --> 30:42.416
Do you think Arthur would tolerate you
for one minute if he knew the truth?

30:44.217 --> 30:46.048
One of his knights, a sorcerer?

30:46.511 --> 30:48.627
One day he will know.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.842
One day we will be accepted.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.929
Your naivety would be charming
if it wasn't so dangerous.

30:56.396 --> 30:59.684
- Where's emrys?
- Emrys?

30:59.858 --> 31:02.725
You pretend you do not know
of whom I speak?

31:02.903 --> 31:04.734
It is a name I've only heard of.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.695
He's not here?

31:08.075 --> 31:09.986
- With you?
- If he was

31:10.577 --> 31:13.444
would we both not feel the presence
of such a great sorcerer?

31:21.922 --> 31:23.537
Then I have no further use for you.

31:25.258 --> 31:27.169
You would strike one of your own?

31:27.969 --> 31:30.836
I am not strong enough to defeat you,
morgana, but know this.

31:31.973 --> 31:35.261
Such hatred as yours can never triumph.

31:36.144 --> 31:40.478
I hope one day you will find the love and
compassion which used to fill your heart.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.795
It's as Gaius described.

32:06.550 --> 32:08.962
The cauldron of arianrhod.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.686
Where's the sorceress?

32:26.194 --> 32:29.652
Gaius says she's a recluse.
She shuns the company of men.

32:29.823 --> 32:31.814
She's gonna have to make an exception.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.952
We haven't got much time.
Guinevere could wake up.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.825
I've got more tincture. No.

32:35.996 --> 32:37.281
No more I won't risk it.

32:38.165 --> 32:39.245
We have to find her.

32:39.416 --> 32:41.247
I'll search her out

32:49.176 --> 32:51.096
You didn't think this was gonna be free,
did you?

32:51.595 --> 32:53.426
What are you talking about?

32:53.930 --> 32:55.466
The sorceress.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.632
She likes to be paid in clothes.

33:00.353 --> 33:01.889
She can't get to a tailor.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.729
Why would a recluse
be interested in clothes?

33:04.900 --> 33:08.063
I don't know, Arthur. She's a sorceress.
She's not gonna be normal, is she?

33:32.886 --> 33:35.047
Not long now, my love.

33:40.477 --> 33:42.138
Mordred?

33:42.354 --> 33:45.221
I thought we'd lost you.
So did I.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.605
How did you escape morgana?

33:47.943 --> 33:50.275
Even she is no match
for a knight of the round table.

33:50.445 --> 33:52.151
Seriously, mordred.

34:05.919 --> 34:08.001
Now it makes sense.

34:08.630 --> 34:11.909
- Merlin said she had trouble getting
clothes. Merlin: Who are you?

34:12.007 --> 34:14.841
What business have you
in this sacred place?

34:15.428 --> 34:17.589
Are you the dolma?

34:17.764 --> 34:20.176
Ancient sorceress
of the cauldron of arianrhod?

34:24.563 --> 34:26.428
Who else would I be?

34:28.858 --> 34:31.224
Does she look familiar to you?

34:32.320 --> 34:35.062
- There is something.
Merlin: What say you?

34:35.239 --> 34:36.821
Why do you mutter?

34:36.992 --> 34:39.277
You look familiar, sorceress.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.284
Oh, heh.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.914
Is that so?

34:47.543 --> 34:48.909
It is

34:49.087 --> 34:50.577
my lord, where is Merlin”?

34:56.261 --> 34:58.593
What have you done with my servant?

35:00.181 --> 35:01.762
Oh.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.844
The gangly boy.

35:04.019 --> 35:05.099
Mm.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.511
If you kill me, you'll never see him again.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.765
I am an old woman.

35:11.943 --> 35:15.310
Is it not natural I seek some surety?

35:16.615 --> 35:20.984
The boy will be returned to you
when we have concluded our business.

35:21.828 --> 35:25.741
- You know why we're here.
- Nothing is hidden from...

35:25.915 --> 35:28.156
The dolma.

35:28.501 --> 35:32.335
Now hurry, before your queen awakes.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.461
Set her by the pool.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.889
Great king...

35:46.102 --> 35:49.594
The magic which has ensnared your queen
is strong indeed.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.013
It can be fought.

35:52.192 --> 35:54.729
It can be broken, but it may also prevail.

35:54.903 --> 35:57.144
- Do you understand this?
- I do.

35:57.322 --> 36:02.157
What we attempt will not be easy. If we
fail, your queen will be lost forever.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.659
- I understand.
Merlin: Very well.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.116
When I awake Guinevere from her sleep...

36:07.290 --> 36:10.578
She must walk into the cauldron
of arianrhod of her own will.

36:10.752 --> 36:14.119
Only then will the spell be broken,
but be warned.

36:14.297 --> 36:17.209
All the magic that binds her
will fight against it.

36:17.759 --> 36:20.250
- How then can we succeed?
Merlin: You

36:20.595 --> 36:24.179
must reach her, Arthur.

36:26.976 --> 36:31.720
Reach that part of your queen which has
remained untouched by the evil of morgana.

36:31.898 --> 36:35.607
Is there such a part?
You must believe there is.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.560
Prepare.

36:42.701 --> 36:46.034
When she wakes,
you will have but a few moments.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.457
Where am I?

37:35.044 --> 37:38.628
- What have you done to me?
- You've been asleep for a long time.

37:38.798 --> 37:41.318
- Guinevere... my Guinevere.
- Get away from me! Your Guinevere?

37:41.468 --> 37:44.175
You stupid foolish man.
I was never yours and never will be.

37:44.345 --> 37:47.428
You must reach her, Arthur.
Reach out or all is lost.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.056
Who's this old crone?
You loved me once.

37:50.226 --> 37:51.386
You're easily fooled, Arthur.

37:51.561 --> 37:53.426
- And still do.
- It was a trick.

37:53.605 --> 37:54.685
Nothing more.

37:54.856 --> 37:57.347
A subterfuge to pass Camelot
to its rightful queen.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.561
- I don't believe that.
- Believe what you like.

37:59.736 --> 38:03.900
- Fact remains.
- No, it must be of her own will.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.483
I ook at me.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.868
- Tell me you don't love me.
- Let me go.

38:11.039 --> 38:12.495
Arthur.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.749
Do you remember
when I asked you to marry me?

38:16.920 --> 38:18.535
Do you remember what you said?

38:19.214 --> 38:21.751
You said "with all my heart."
That's what you said, Guinevere.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.712
That was no subterfuge. No trickery.

38:31.059 --> 38:33.095
With all my heart.

38:42.362 --> 38:44.444
With all my heart.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.964
With all my heart.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.100
Come.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.608
Arthur:
I owe you a great debt. We both do.

40:47.779 --> 40:50.816
If there's ever anything I can do
in return... perhaps a new dress?

40:50.990 --> 40:53.857
- Arthur!
- She likes clothes.

40:55.328 --> 40:56.864
There is one thing.

40:57.372 --> 41:01.661
- Name it.
- Remember what saved your queen.

41:01.834 --> 41:04.075
Magic and sorcery.

41:04.253 --> 41:05.868
It was also sorcery that bewitched her.

41:06.047 --> 41:10.256
There is no evil in sorcery,
only in the hearts of men.

41:10.426 --> 41:13.293
My request is...

41:13.513 --> 41:15.845
That you remember this.

41:17.058 --> 41:18.343
You have my word.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.441
Aren't you forgetting something?

41:38.955 --> 41:40.411
I don't think so.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.287
The boy?

41:44.585 --> 41:46.917
Ah ah.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.662
Of course, I thought everything had gone
unusually smoothly.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.832
That boy was your surety, great king.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.626
Without him, your queen
would still be lost.

41:55.680 --> 41:59.138
- Not sure that's quite true.
- And I say it is!

42:01.436 --> 42:06.681
You owe him a greater debt
than you can possibly know.

42:09.110 --> 42:10.816
Right. Um...

42:11.654 --> 42:12.860
I'm sorry. I'll...

42:13.031 --> 42:15.147
Give him the afternoon off.

42:18.995 --> 42:22.908
One day, great king...

42:23.082 --> 42:27.325
You will recognize the true worth
of those that surround you.

42:30.715 --> 42:32.376
(50.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.320
Mordred: Arthur's a lucky man.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.285
Yes

43:06.459 --> 43:10.623
not just to have Gwen, but to have you.

43:11.130 --> 43:14.122
He'll find someone else to do his chores
soon enough.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.586
It was hardly a chore.

43:17.637 --> 43:19.798
That was your magic back there, wasn't it?

43:22.433 --> 43:26.426
Have no fear. I will not
divulge your secret.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.436
I admire you.

43:30.316 --> 43:32.728
It can't be easy to do so much
for so little reward.

43:33.069 --> 43:34.525
I do not seek reward.

43:34.695 --> 43:36.976
- Recognition then.
- When my friends are safe and well...

43:37.031 --> 43:38.271
That's all I require.

43:38.449 --> 43:42.067
You see, Merlin, we
do have something in common after all.

43:42.495 --> 43:44.827
The future of Camelot.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.170
Merlin

44:04.142 --> 44:05.803
I want you to tell me where emrys is.
