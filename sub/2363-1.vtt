02:19.000 --> 02:22.637
After the Danish defeat
in the 1864 war, crossed

02:22.649 --> 02:26.000
Jon and his brother
Atlantic to start fresh.

02:26.100 --> 02:31.000
In seven years they struggled to find
foothold in the unknown country.

02:31.100 --> 02:36.500
7 years, where Jon missed his
wife, Marie, and their son.

02:36.600 --> 02:42.000
7 years of family separation.
The year is 1871 The country is America.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Kresten, it's your father.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.000
Welcome Marie. Thank you.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.300
How nice to see you. You too.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.000
Say hello to your uncle, Peter.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.800
Good day.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.800
I'd better see to go.
So do not lose your place on the stage.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.600
Are not you going with us?

05:05.800 --> 05:07.000
Uh, no.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.600
Peter likes to stay
inside the city once in a while.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.200
Hey. Hello, ma'am.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Where are you going?

05:46.700 --> 05:51.000
My wife does not speak American.
She must learn it.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.400
You look like them not only.
You also sound like them.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.800
It comes in also.

06:06.400 --> 06:11.200
Sorry, but it's been a mistake.
You must take the next coach.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.600
But we paid for this trip.
Sorry, ma'am.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.200
How to treat not his fellow men.

06:17.300 --> 06:21.000
We have traveled for weeks.
Sorry ma'am, but must stand by.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.400
Do as he says.

07:15.400 --> 07:19.000
Are there many animals?
Yes, there are many different animals.

07:19.100 --> 07:23.700
There are foxes, there are bears, there
are deer. Are there bears where we live?

07:23.800 --> 07:27.000
Where we live?
No, there is not any.

07:33.700 --> 07:36.500
But if there was one...

07:36.600 --> 07:41.300
Then we shoot it and rip it.
And sell it down in the city.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.600
Is there a town nearby?
Yeah, not so far from us.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.000
We can be back there in a day.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.500
Kresten...
You should not be worried, right?

07:53.600 --> 07:55.000
It's a really nice place.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.500
And I've built,
so there is room for all of us.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
When are you really big enough
to take out hunting?

08:08.500 --> 08:11.000
I think actually,
it is tomorrow.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.500
If you fancy.

08:19.500 --> 08:26.000
Sorry, I have not had a drink in three
years. I had forgotten what it does to one.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.799
Out here when offered a drink, ma'am...
So drinking man.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.400
Marie, take a sip.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.300
It's get em to do here.

08:57.500 --> 09:01.000
You do not have much,
to say, right?

09:01.600 --> 09:04.000
I like that.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.300
My own princess does not say a word.
She is dumb.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.600
Indians cut her
tongue when she was little.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.435
They were probably tired
of hearing that she

09:17.447 --> 09:19.800
screamed, when they
killed her parents.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.900
What's your name?

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
My wife's name is Marie.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.600
It's a beautiful name.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.700
Are you just get here?

09:38.800 --> 09:43.400
My wife and son have just come.
I've been here a while.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.600
It is not easy for anyone,
to be outside a woman, for so long.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.300
Boy, is this hot.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.600
You're not used
to the heat, well, Marie?

10:19.700 --> 10:22.100
No, you're probably not.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.100
There is always a solution.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.400
Let's look at the goods.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.000
Stop it.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.400
What a hot little flower.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.000
Stop it.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.500
Are you threatening me?

10:44.600 --> 10:48.400
No, I'm saying that you need to keep
hands away and behave yourself.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
It does sound as you threaten me.

10:52.700 --> 10:56.100
That's how I hear it.
What say you, Lester?

10:59.100 --> 11:00.000
Yes.

11:00.100 --> 11:03.300
I'm not trying to threaten anyone,
I'm just...

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
What will you do now?

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
You can not do anything.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.100
Come here!

11:30.700 --> 11:35.500
Nothing.
You can not do a damn thing.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.100
Sit still!

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
Bite his ear.
Marie, bite his ear.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.500
Do not be afraid.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.400
Kresten, roof turret.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Do not be afraid.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.000
Just take it.

12:15.400 --> 12:19.600
And stay down, Kresten.
No, stay down. Stay down, Kresten!

12:22.400 --> 12:25.000
Lower turret.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.800
Lower it!

12:27.900 --> 12:32.000
For fuck's sake.
You I do not like.

12:33.700 --> 12:36.300
You have 5 seconds to get off.

12:42.700 --> 12:45.400
Is that clear? A...

12:52.900 --> 12:54.100
Two!

13:04.300 --> 13:05.400
Three.

13:05.500 --> 13:09.000
Marie...

17:36.600 --> 17:40.000
She's not dead! She is doing it!

17:41.000 --> 17:42.500
Wait, wait!

17:45.500 --> 17:48.000
She is not dead.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.700
Wait, wait.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.000
I did not touch the boy.

20:27.900 --> 20:30.000
Who did it?

20:34.100 --> 20:37.000
I have not seen them before.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.000
Strangers.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
It's a sad day, sir. Delarue.

21:56.200 --> 22:00.127
But we must remember that
no one in this peaceful

22:00.139 --> 22:04.000
town, involved in the
gruesome killing your men.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.000
Where is my brother?

22:08.400 --> 22:11.000
Your brother?

22:41.900 --> 22:45.000
Mayor, Keane? Yes?

22:45.400 --> 22:50.000
Make sure he does not stink of booze,
when the princess sees him.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.000
Course.

22:52.100 --> 22:57.000
Bring him to my house,
so do I, that he is being nice.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.100
Take him there.

23:09.600 --> 23:12.300
Did you catch the killer?

23:12.400 --> 23:16.800
Mr. Delarue, I can say with certainty
that this is not here.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.500
I want to know who killed my brother.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
There are no surviving witnesses.

23:24.100 --> 23:27.000
Competitors and gunfighter
were also killed.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
We lost two men today.

23:33.100 --> 23:36.000
One was my brother.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.900
I will give you two hours
to find the man who did it.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.200
And the sheriff...
I want that man alive.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.100
It is impossible.

23:54.500 --> 23:58.000
You are a thought man, sheriff Mallick.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.600
You probably know the Lord's words:

24:01.700 --> 24:04.000
Tooth for tooth...

24:04.500 --> 24:06.000
Yes.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
You get up at. 12, to
find the man who did it.

24:11.100 --> 24:14.100
Otherwise, you
with two of your citizens.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.000
Mr. Delarue...

24:16.100 --> 24:19.100
You choose two, Mayor Keane...

24:20.700 --> 24:23.400
Otherwise I shoot four.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.400
Course.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.500
I am ready, Father.

24:53.100 --> 24:56.100
The whole town will forever
be grateful to you.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.000
Promise me that you take
from my grandson.

24:59.100 --> 25:01.000
We must do our best.

25:01.100 --> 25:04.800
I will make sure
the boy learn to operate the store.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.200
It can not be right.

25:09.500 --> 25:12.100
I am not sure
I can do without you, Grandma.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.500
Of course you can, my boy.

25:42.900 --> 25:46.000
Leave me alone, will not suffice.

25:48.700 --> 25:52.800
I beg you, father.
Help me, Father.

25:52.900 --> 25:56.400
My life is not so paltry.
I will not die!

25:56.800 --> 26:00.000
I've never been a burden to anyone.
I am innocent.

26:13.600 --> 26:17.000
May God have mercy on your wicked soul.

27:00.300 --> 27:03.300
Stay calm, everyone.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.200
Well, Sheriff...

27:19.000 --> 27:22.300
A tired old woman
and a half man...

27:23.900 --> 27:26.100
- Was not good enough.

27:26.200 --> 27:31.000
The man's death
are you two's expense.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.300
Tell me, Mayor Keane...

27:39.700 --> 27:44.000
How much will your town
Black Creek, for protection.

27:44.100 --> 27:47.000
80 dollars each month.

27:47.100 --> 27:51.600
I believe in the need for more protection
when there is a murderer in the vicinity.

27:55.200 --> 27:59.500
In the future...
the amount is doubled.

27:59.600 --> 28:03.300
Mr. Delarue, the soil is not fertile.
We can not make as much money.

28:03.400 --> 28:07.100
$ 160, by the month end.
Every month.

28:07.200 --> 28:10.800
Until this has been
the man who killed my brother.

28:11.900 --> 28:14.200
Do we agree?

28:15.100 --> 28:18.800
Yes. Yes, we are.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.000
I thought so.

29:32.300 --> 29:35.300
Let him rest in peace, princess.

29:35.900 --> 29:39.200
I find the man who killed Paul.

29:39.400 --> 29:44.400
And I'll make sure he dies.
You have my word on that.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.500
I'll take care of you now.
Together...

30:35.900 --> 30:38.400
Raul, see.

30:42.200 --> 30:45.000
I'll go and talk to the sheriff.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.700
See you in a bit.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.100
Good day.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Where is your grandmother?

31:29.300 --> 31:31.100
She is dead.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.100
Delarue shot her.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.700
I'm sorry to hear that.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.000
What can I do for you?

31:43.700 --> 31:46.000
I have some skins.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.400
We go west.

32:00.100 --> 32:04.200
So the only two men in the vicinity,
who can shoot, go away.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.600
Evidently.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.200
Were not you two soldiers
where you came?

32:10.800 --> 32:14.700
We need people like you,
To overcome the killer.

32:16.800 --> 32:21.300
I have been a soldier once,
and it taught me something.

32:22.300 --> 32:26.500
Do not start a fight,
as you know, you lose.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.500
Cowards.

32:31.200 --> 32:34.200
Funeral NATHAN KEANE

32:40.100 --> 32:42.000
Who is it?

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Jon.

32:45.900 --> 32:48.300
It's nice to see you in town
for once.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.500
Buyer can still reasons?

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
From time to time, yes.

32:56.300 --> 32:59.000
How much will you give?

33:01.500 --> 33:05.200
I can give you no more than 145th

33:06.600 --> 33:10.000
It is lame so much
we did 6 years ago.

33:10.100 --> 33:12.400
As I said,
these are tough times.

33:12.500 --> 33:18.000
Since Delerue increased fees,
there are many people who want to sell.

33:18.500 --> 33:22.700
But because you are a good man,
I want to help.

33:22.800 --> 33:26.000
Shall we say 150?

33:26.500 --> 33:28.300
Or you can wait.

33:28.400 --> 33:33.000
Who knows. If they find the man
that killed Delarue's brother -

33:33.400 --> 33:37.400
- Then there would be peace,
and prices will rise.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.800
What man? Have you not heard?

33:41.900 --> 33:46.000
Delarue's brother had just come out
of prison as a madman killed him.

33:46.100 --> 33:49.000
He shot all the coach.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.200
Since it is so...

33:58.000 --> 34:02.300
I take the 150th
You will not regret.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.500
You must sign here.

34:15.100 --> 34:17.199
Where are you going?

34:17.800 --> 34:20.500
I will try,
to find a place on the west.

34:20.699 --> 34:24.300
I would probably do the same,
If I was a young mayor.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.400
These are for you.

34:26.500 --> 34:29.699
And this is for me.

34:31.699 --> 34:35.000
It is important to save
the money, a good place.

34:35.300 --> 34:38.000
In your boots, maybe?

34:42.600 --> 34:45.500
There are many hungry people out there.

36:16.800 --> 36:24.000
14, 15-tails to a total
value of $ 3,148.

36:24.100 --> 36:32.100
Plus 12 percent, then your
share $ 3,524.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.100
And 76 cents.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.200
Let's say one dollar.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.800
Madelaine appreciate
the accounts fit.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.200
The devil is in the details...

36:57.800 --> 37:01.000
The company does not like,
how it looks now.

37:01.500 --> 37:04.093
Are you aware that the
sheriff in Black Creek,

37:04.105 --> 37:06.600
have telegraphed to the
government for help.

37:07.400 --> 37:10.500
I have been blocked
the connection being.

37:10.600 --> 37:14.200
But you can not use
the same methods as in the army.

37:14.300 --> 37:17.400
It's not Indians.

37:17.700 --> 37:22.000
Standard Atlantic, is a modern company
Colonel Delarue.

37:22.100 --> 37:26.000
And we use seviliserede methods.

37:26.500 --> 37:29.200
Is that clear?

37:30.900 --> 37:32.500
Good.

37:34.600 --> 37:38.400
When the entire Black Creek bought?

37:38.500 --> 37:42.000
I bought the entire valley in a week
if I do it my way.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.300
Answer my question.

37:45.000 --> 37:51.400
If you can keep the military outside,
so I expect 3-4 months.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.800
It was just what I wanted to know.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.900
Have a nice day.

38:16.200 --> 38:20.200
So they want me to,
to behave seviliseret, princess.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.600
I can certainly good.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.600
As long as we stack of money.

38:49.800 --> 38:53.300
Okay guys. I will do the rest.

39:11.300 --> 39:15.200
Let Peter go. Mallick?

39:16.300 --> 39:21.000
He was not on the stage.
You have nothing on him.

39:22.700 --> 39:29.100
He broke the jaw of a deputy sheriff.
He must take his sentence.

39:35.900 --> 39:41.500
Unfortunately, it...
a little different for you.

39:41.700 --> 39:46.400
I had to send a message to Delarue,
that we have caught you.

39:49.000 --> 39:57.000
You probably know that he has...
made life difficult for... us.

39:58.900 --> 40:01.500
I do not know
what has happened to him.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.300
He was once a good man.

40:06.600 --> 40:10.300
To kill all the Indians,
must have...

40:11.300 --> 40:14.000
- Injured his mind.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.700
I am sorry for your loss, Jon.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
I am.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.300
It seems that you
follow in his footsteps.

40:26.400 --> 40:33.400
If you blue had shown little mercy, to
Delarue's brother, instead of killing him.

40:33.500 --> 40:40.800
So would Mrs. Borowski, sir. Whisler
and Joe legless still be here.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.600
It will not be the last man
Delarue killer around here.

40:46.700 --> 40:49.500
No. Probably not.

40:51.500 --> 40:55.000
But your dead will win us some time.

40:56.200 --> 40:59.000
I have already
telegraphed for help.

40:59.100 --> 41:03.200
So there may be law and order again.

41:04.000 --> 41:08.600
Sometimes you have to sacrifice a sheep,
to save the rest.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.300
I'm just a shepherd.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.800
They say that you have been a soldier.

41:56.300 --> 41:58.600
Have you been to war?

42:00.300 --> 42:01.600
Yes.

42:02.300 --> 42:04.400
Who was the enemy.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.500
The Germans.

42:06.800 --> 42:09.800
The Germans? Bravo.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.600
You have my respect.

43:46.200 --> 43:48.300
Here he saw.

43:48.400 --> 43:53.000
The sick bastard who beat
your beloved husband to death.

43:54.900 --> 43:58.800
Your beloved husband,
beat my 10-year-old son to death.

44:00.900 --> 44:03.500
And he raped my wife.

44:07.400 --> 44:10.200
You must keep quiet.

44:25.300 --> 44:29.100
We'll find out soon enough,
what can he do, soldier.

45:34.700 --> 45:37.000
You're late.

45:37.100 --> 45:39.600
I'll be right with you, Henry.

45:39.700 --> 45:42.100
Can I have his boots?

45:42.500 --> 45:44.300
Here you go.

45:48.700 --> 45:50.400
Keane...

45:50.500 --> 45:54.600
You will not need, my friend.
Not where you are going.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.400
I have a baptism this morning.

46:16.600 --> 46:19.700
So Sunday Mass
takes a little longer.

46:20.500 --> 46:26.200
Give him water if he asks for it.
And you must not think of anything.

46:37.400 --> 46:39.500
Can I have some water?

46:41.200 --> 46:42.600
No.

46:55.200 --> 46:58.000
I'm sorry that I will
back to you.

47:00.100 --> 47:03.400
But the view is better like this.

47:05.600 --> 47:08.800
I had given you a blow,
did not I?

47:12.500 --> 47:16.500
You were good enough ugly
before I beat your teeth in...

47:17.900 --> 47:20.100
But now...

47:20.700 --> 47:23.100
I hope that you have
a woman who loves you.

47:23.200 --> 47:26.400
For you will not find
with that face.

47:30.100 --> 47:34.500
You've probably never gotten anything
without paying for it.

47:36.800 --> 47:40.600
Not with your ridiculous voice.

47:42.700 --> 47:46.000
But now it comes to cost more.
It certainly is.

47:46.100 --> 47:47.100
Shut up!

47:47.200 --> 47:52.000
I did you a favor actually.
I think it's better now.

47:52.600 --> 47:56.900
Now you sound not just as a sick mule,
Now you look like also.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.100
I said shut up!

48:00.000 --> 48:03.900
Now people are not so surprised
when you say something.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.300
I'll kill you.

48:05.400 --> 48:07.500
It is certainly something
which runs in the family.

48:07.600 --> 48:13.000
I am sure that your whore mother sounded
like a mule when you were conceived.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.800
Wow!

48:45.300 --> 48:50.000
Do you know how long,
I've been waiting for this moment.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.900
You could feel, right?

48:57.500 --> 49:00.100
Of course you would.

49:00.600 --> 49:04.500
You are so... beautiful.

49:05.800 --> 49:13.800
What these barbarians have done to you...
Got your tongue.

49:16.600 --> 49:20.500
I know it must have been
terrible for you.

49:20.600 --> 49:26.000
But I see it... as a gift...

49:26.500 --> 49:28.300
- To me.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
When I'm done here...

49:35.100 --> 49:39.700
- We find a house in New Orleans.

49:40.600 --> 49:43.300
It will suit you.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
You will be New Orleans princess.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Get the horses.

53:42.800 --> 53:47.000
Jon! Jon! I'll be back.

54:04.600 --> 54:06.200
They have taken different roads.

54:06.300 --> 54:09.200
Corsican, take half
of men with you on the trail.

54:09.300 --> 54:11.000
The rest come with me.

57:33.500 --> 57:35.500
Third class.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.300
Take your sister inside,
and retrieve father's rifle.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.300
You are not welcome.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.400
You should not drink from the well,
it is full of the sticky oil.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.700
I have put something
bread and boiled water.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.400
Thank you, Mrs. Whisler.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.200
Why are you leaving?
Delarue killed my husband.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.800
I'm sorry I leave you that way.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.100
Are you with us?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I'll be fine.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.000
He'll kill you.

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:11.500
Your Paul, he...
He saved you from the Indians.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.600
But he never tamed you.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:20.900
Damn.

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.200
Now I must kill you.

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:30.600
It's a shame, Henry.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.400
We could treat her well.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.500
The body fine.

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:45.600
Once more...
Smiling lady luck to you.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:55.300
After all you've been having fun
with her... So inserts her throat.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.500
I want my boots back.

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.500
Your boots?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.200
Course.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.600
I saved these for you.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.900
I keep them neat and clean. See.

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.600
Here.

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:51.500
Have you purchased Mrs. Whisler's farm?

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:55.000
Yes, I think that I have.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.000
Have you lap?

01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:01.500
What? I do not understand...
What about my deed?

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.400
Do you want your money?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Clear. They are here.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
They are here, Jon.
Take them, take them all together.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:17.100
What were you doing at Delarue?

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.500
There was one that was dead.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:25.200
Everyone deserves a coffin.
Although they do not go to heaven.

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.600
Henry... What?

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.800
You called him Henry.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.400
Remove the lid of the coffin.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.200
Course.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.300
I am undertaker.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:02.200
That's why I was there.
Somebody has to take care of it.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Lie in it.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.200
I'm just trying to get it
best of it.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.500
That's it. I'm a businessman.

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:21.000
You're not even human.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.000
What are you planning?
Lie in it.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.400
That you will not get away with.
Lie in it.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.100
I am the mayor.

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.200
I try to help people.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.000
No one will buy their land.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.500
Will not you leave it.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.600
No. God, no.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.300
You're right, Jon.

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:58.000
I keep not deeds.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.100
I give them to Delarue.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:25.200
I need a gun with belt
and ammunition for my rifle.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.800
Give me a knife.
I'll pay for it.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.400
Give me also two bottles of kerosene.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.000
You must go to Mallick, for me.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:02.200
Tell him that Keane has served
money on all of us.

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:05.300
All the land and houses he bought...

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:09.200
It was not for himself,
he sold it to Delarue.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.700
It is the oil.

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.399
Delarue believe that it will soon
is worth a lot.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.100
Do you and your brother
fight Delarue alone?

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.700
No, my brother is dead.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.399
Let me go with you.

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:35.000
You're just a boy.
I am almost 16 years.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.200
I've been practicing.
I am good at shooting.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.700
You do not have a chance alone.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.200
He has taken his own chest with.

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:39.399
Burn him.

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.400
There is a fire in the barn!

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.400
Shoot! Do it now!

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:50.500
I have underestimated you, soldier.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:54.400
You may have killed all my people.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.000
But you are definitely...

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.000
So you killed him.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:27.000
And all his people.

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:39.000
We've been hoping... and praying.

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:42.200
In order that there should
be someone like you.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.500
And save us from our despair.

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.700
And so did you.

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:53.000
Now there are only good
people back.

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:11.100
I thought you had
hit on all of them.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.100
She's with me.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.600
It will not do, Jon.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.400
I would like to have,
that you leave the place.

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:44.000
May God forgive both your souls.
