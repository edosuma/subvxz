"Happy Birthday, Dog"?

00:38.614 --> 00:41.265
Sorry, I spaced on your name
at the party store.

00:41.283 --> 00:42.432
Have a good one, Brent.

00:42.451 --> 00:44.209
(doorbell rings)

00:44.361 --> 00:46.103
Thanks for having us, Peter.

00:46.196 --> 00:48.530
I don't recall
inviting Kevin, but sure.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.864
BRIAN:
His name you remember!

00:49.958 --> 00:52.109
I think it's ridiculous
to have a party for a dog.

00:52.127 --> 00:54.945
Why spend money on something
he can't even comprehend?

00:54.963 --> 00:56.780
(growling)

00:56.799 --> 00:58.949
This ball is nuts.

00:59.042 --> 01:00.967
Hey, happy birthday, Brian!

01:01.120 --> 01:03.062
Bonnie and I got you
a big stick.

01:03.213 --> 01:04.712
Wow, thank you!

01:04.732 --> 01:06.139
I'm gonna take it
into the kitchen

01:06.292 --> 01:08.358
and I don't foresee having
any issues with that.

01:09.904 --> 01:11.361
(grunts)

01:12.648 --> 01:13.772
(grunts)

01:13.924 --> 01:16.057
(grunting)

01:16.151 --> 01:17.892
Okay, I can make this work.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.803
Think, Brent, think.

01:19.896 --> 01:21.655
Uh, Joe,
isn't that the same stick

01:21.749 --> 01:23.064
we gave you for your wedding?

01:23.158 --> 01:24.991
You told me it was a magic wand.

01:25.144 --> 01:26.901
I pointed it at a bus,
the bus crashed,

01:26.995 --> 01:28.420
that's all I'm saying.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.164
Happy Birthday, Brian.

01:31.317 --> 01:32.574
I got you a card.

01:32.742 --> 01:35.577
On the front it says, "Too much
sex ruins your eyesight"

01:35.596 --> 01:38.079
and on the inside it says,
"Happy Birthday,"

01:38.099 --> 01:40.915
but all blurry--
Oh! I gave it away!

01:41.009 --> 01:44.494
It also says,
"Love, Aunt Judy and Uncle Bob."

01:44.588 --> 01:48.440
A joke that good doesn't
celebrate just one birthday.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.016
Well, fellas, I'm off.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.018
Old Joe's got
a big stakeout this week,

01:52.171 --> 01:54.020
so I'm gonna practice
by watching the party

01:54.115 --> 01:55.739
from across the street.

01:57.009 --> 01:58.492
(door closes)

01:59.862 --> 02:02.121
(grunts)

02:02.348 --> 02:06.683
"Those who doubt the wand's
power suffer the wand's wrath."

02:06.702 --> 02:09.035
Leviticus 26:12.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.871
(indistinct chatter)

02:11.023 --> 02:13.373
Was anybody gonna wake me up
for the party?

02:13.525 --> 02:15.300
It's 6:30.
I went down at noon.

02:15.452 --> 02:18.453
Now I'm gonna be up all night,
watching bad reality TV.

02:18.547 --> 02:21.956
<i> ANNOUNCER: We now return to</i>

Where the hell have you been?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.163
I been here, man.

02:44.314 --> 02:45.889
Maybe you press wrong button.
I don't know.

02:45.908 --> 02:49.459
Now don't talk to me. I'm on
four different phone calls.

02:56.251 --> 02:57.509
Hi, everyone, Peter Griffin.

02:57.661 --> 03:00.012
Welcome to the roast portion
of the evening.

03:00.239 --> 03:02.422
Ladies and gentleman:
my son, Chris.

03:02.574 --> 03:04.666
Born on the highway,
because that is where

03:04.685 --> 03:06.760
-most accidents happen.
-LOIS: Peter!

03:06.854 --> 03:08.078
But we're here to talk about

03:08.096 --> 03:09.688
Brian getting
another year older.

03:09.839 --> 03:12.416
You know, I hear he can't even
bury a bone these days

03:12.434 --> 03:13.767
without Viagra.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.177
Ha, all right,
all right, I can take it.

03:16.271 --> 03:18.530
And they say you can't teach
an old dog new tricks,

03:18.757 --> 03:21.608
but I heard Brian just learned
how to roll over and beg...

03:21.760 --> 03:23.035
for an erection.

03:23.262 --> 03:25.019
(chuckling) Okay.
That's sort of

03:25.113 --> 03:26.930
just another jab
at my penis, but sure.

03:26.949 --> 03:28.040
On the positive side,

03:28.267 --> 03:30.283
Brian's latest book
was a real page-turner.

03:30.436 --> 03:32.936
Yeah, I turned the pages
into toilet paper.

03:33.071 --> 03:34.287
'Cause Brian's old now

03:34.440 --> 03:36.715
and can't satisfy women
through intercourse.

03:36.942 --> 03:37.958
Peter, I'm fine.

03:38.110 --> 03:39.443
Are you sure
this isn't about you

03:39.461 --> 03:41.111
not being able to perform
on your anniversary?

03:41.129 --> 03:43.388
I told you that in confidence!

03:49.063 --> 03:50.454
Whoa, slow down, buddy.

03:50.472 --> 03:52.305
It's snack time,
not Black Friday.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.807
Nobody's walking outta here

03:53.901 --> 03:55.792
with<i> First Wives Club</i>
on Blu-ray, okay?

03:55.811 --> 03:57.143
Nice as that sounds.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.554
I heard there's a special
feature on the Blu-ray

03:59.573 --> 04:02.056
that's just Diane Keaton
shrieking the commentary.

04:02.150 --> 04:03.242
Huge, if true.

04:03.469 --> 04:06.470
Actually, Stewie,
there's something important

04:06.488 --> 04:08.580
I sorta need
to talk to you about.

04:08.807 --> 04:09.806
Okay.

04:09.941 --> 04:12.918
I recently found out
I have cooties.

04:13.069 --> 04:14.902
And you're telling me why?

04:14.997 --> 04:16.646
Well, I mean, uh...

04:16.665 --> 04:17.981
remember last week?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.258
When we ate from
the same Play-Doh?

04:19.409 --> 04:22.210

04:40.597 --> 04:42.355
I just think
you should get tested, okay?

04:42.508 --> 04:45.025
What? You mean
I played with the Play-Doh

04:45.177 --> 04:47.177
everyone you ever played
Play-Doh with played with?

04:47.195 --> 04:48.361
I've been played!

04:49.623 --> 04:53.199
Can I have a chocolate milk
with my snack today, please?

04:53.294 --> 04:57.045
What? Honey, the chocolate milk
is the snack.

04:59.875 --> 05:01.875
(doorbell rings)

05:01.969 --> 05:03.693
Hey, Bonnie. Is Joe around?

05:03.787 --> 05:05.195
No, he's on his stakeout.

05:05.213 --> 05:06.138
Oh, that's too bad.

05:06.365 --> 05:08.289
Tomorrow's Chris's Career Day,

05:08.383 --> 05:10.550
and Joe's hat is a key element
of what I do.

05:10.702 --> 05:13.812
So that's how I became
Quahog's first ninja cop.

05:13.963 --> 05:15.647
-Questions?
-Yes.

05:15.799 --> 05:17.298
-Mister--
-Officer Hi-yah.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.209
Did you park in
the handicapped spot?

05:19.227 --> 05:21.044
Ninjas don't have cars.

05:21.063 --> 05:22.212
Well, it's gettin' towed.

05:22.305 --> 05:24.156
Oh, no! My Chevy Cruze!

05:24.383 --> 05:25.899
Thank you. Thank you.

05:26.051 --> 05:28.142
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

05:28.236 --> 05:29.219
(running footsteps)

05:29.312 --> 05:31.646
Man, something
smells good in here.

05:31.740 --> 05:32.998
You cooking brussels sprouts?

05:33.225 --> 05:34.649
No, I just farted.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.742
That checks out.

05:35.894 --> 05:37.227
Anyway,
somethin' else smells good.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.745
I think dinner's ready.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.113
I didn't hear a ding.

05:40.265 --> 05:41.840
That's how I always know
to run into the kitchen,

05:41.991 --> 05:43.249
shove a napkin in my shirt

05:43.402 --> 05:45.251
and hold my utensils
upright at the table.

05:45.404 --> 05:48.597
Well, I made it in the oven,
not the microwave.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.227
You want a little taste?

05:57.082 --> 05:58.264
Holy crap.

05:58.417 --> 06:00.250
That's the best thing
I've ever had.

06:00.268 --> 06:02.861
You know, I usually cook
for one-and-a-half,

06:03.012 --> 06:05.179
but Joe's still on his stakeout.

06:05.273 --> 06:06.365
You want to stay for dinner?

06:06.516 --> 06:09.183
Ah, man, I'd love to,
but it'd be wrong.

06:09.277 --> 06:10.702
I always eat dinner with Lois.

06:10.929 --> 06:12.278
Aw, you sure?

06:12.431 --> 06:14.873
You can sit in Joe's
dining harness if you like.

06:15.024 --> 06:16.208
How's he get into that thing?

06:16.359 --> 06:18.618
We have a large array
of medical-grade cranes

06:18.770 --> 06:19.953
and pulleys that lift him.

06:20.105 --> 06:22.381
-Man, that must make
the house ugly.
-It does.

06:22.608 --> 06:25.233
(sighs) All right,
I guess I could text Lois.

06:25.235 --> 06:27.094
But just this once.

06:58.493 --> 06:59.901
Okay, we're good.

06:59.995 --> 07:02.178
So, how long have you
had Invisalign?

07:02.180 --> 07:03.663
-You can see it?
-Yeah, I mean,

07:03.757 --> 07:06.007
it's just a name, not a fact.

07:10.989 --> 07:13.006
Okay, Stewie, think positive.

07:13.158 --> 07:14.916
The test results
will be negative.

07:15.010 --> 07:16.342
Chin up, bud.

07:16.495 --> 07:19.921
Incontinence is really not
that uncommon at your age.

07:20.015 --> 07:21.848
What underwear do you recommend?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.683
Depends. (laughs)

07:23.835 --> 07:25.110
Sorry, old joke.

07:25.261 --> 07:27.520
Now, get out of here
and go have some fun.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.614
Make some fake skin
out of dried glue, would ya?

07:29.841 --> 07:31.432
All right, who's next?

07:31.526 --> 07:32.767
Oh.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.936
Stewie. Come in.

07:36.105 --> 07:40.107
Okay, I just want to verify
some medical history here.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.202
Any recent boo-boos?

07:42.354 --> 07:43.186
No.

07:43.279 --> 07:44.871
Any ouchies or uh-ohs?

07:45.023 --> 07:46.039
No, nothing like that. God.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.524
Good, good.

07:47.542 --> 07:49.283
And how many boogies
would you say

07:49.303 --> 07:52.137
-you consume in a week?
-Oh, God, maybe, like... one.

07:52.288 --> 07:54.531
Maybe two during the holidays.
Maybe.

07:54.549 --> 07:56.123
Stewie, I'm your doctor.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.458
I can tell
just by looking at you

07:57.478 --> 07:59.035
that you're eating
more than that.

07:59.054 --> 08:01.313
I'm thinking you had one
just on the way here.

08:01.540 --> 08:03.297
What?

08:03.358 --> 08:04.649
Okay, I did! I'm sorry.

08:04.801 --> 08:07.210
I've just been so nervous
about these test results.

08:07.303 --> 08:09.395
Well, that's understandable,

08:09.548 --> 08:13.808
seeing as how you did
test positive for cooties.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.069
What? That's terrible!

08:16.221 --> 08:19.331
I think you need to get
your affairs in order.

08:19.482 --> 08:21.333
I don't have any affairs!
I'm one!

08:21.484 --> 08:23.335
Well, then you're ready to die.

08:29.417 --> 08:32.235
(humming)

08:32.328 --> 08:33.753
-Did you say something?
-Me?

08:33.905 --> 08:34.921
No, just humming.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.073
It's part of my alternative
cooties therapy.

08:37.092 --> 08:39.409
Did you know you can
literally vibrate disease

08:39.427 --> 08:40.593
out of the body?

08:40.746 --> 08:42.003
No, I know the opposite of that.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.763
Oh, Brian. You'll see.

08:43.915 --> 08:45.081
When you get
this close to death,

08:45.100 --> 08:46.766
your whole perspective changes.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.319
I got your meds, honey.

08:51.606 --> 08:53.439
My father never loved me,

08:53.534 --> 08:56.868
but Stewie--
he take good care of me.

08:57.095 --> 08:59.687
-Who was that?
-That's my 20-year-old nurse.

08:59.781 --> 09:01.264
He's wearing homemade sandals.

09:01.357 --> 09:02.874
Yeah, he has
no medical training.

09:03.101 --> 09:04.376
Stewie, aren't you being
a little dramatic

09:04.603 --> 09:05.602
about this cooties thing?

09:05.620 --> 09:08.104
Brian, this is
the Flintstones cocktail

09:08.123 --> 09:09.548
I have to take every day.

09:09.699 --> 09:11.608
17 Barneys. 18 Wilmas.

09:11.701 --> 09:14.294
I have to take the Bam-Bams
just to keep things moving.

09:14.446 --> 09:16.037
Does this seem dramatic to you?

09:16.131 --> 09:17.222
Yes, incredibly.

09:17.373 --> 09:19.616
NURSE:
Stewie, I found one! Come look!

09:19.709 --> 09:22.135
(sighs) He likes to find frogs
in the garden

09:22.287 --> 09:23.228
and then show them to me.

09:23.379 --> 09:26.022
His simplicity keeps me young.

09:31.296 --> 09:33.220
Peter, what's wrong?

09:33.315 --> 09:34.555
You don't have an appetite.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.408
I'm gonna get one,
just give me a minute.

09:36.559 --> 09:38.059
You've barely touched
your dinner.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.636
Lois, the more
you talk about it,

09:39.654 --> 09:40.804
the more it's gonna be
a whole thing.

09:40.897 --> 09:42.581
Just let me focus here.

09:43.809 --> 09:46.167
Okay, okay, that's working.

09:47.495 --> 09:49.662
Mmm, oh, this is better, Bonnie.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.590
Did you just call me Bonnie?

09:51.817 --> 09:53.817
No! God-- God, no!

09:53.835 --> 09:55.501
We all heard it, Dad.

09:55.596 --> 09:56.678
Hey, Chris?

09:58.081 --> 10:00.173
'Kay? Got it?

10:00.325 --> 10:02.100
Well, what if I spiced it up
for you, Peter?

10:02.327 --> 10:04.603
I-I think I saw
a take-out mustard packet

10:04.754 --> 10:05.937
in the key drawer.

10:06.089 --> 10:07.330
That's a water bed
for my army guy.

10:07.423 --> 10:09.165
What if you spun
the plate around, Dad?

10:09.184 --> 10:10.442
Tried it from behind?

10:10.669 --> 10:12.001
Meg, go to place.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.594
Ugh, do I have to?

10:13.614 --> 10:15.196
I said "go to place"!

10:18.693 --> 10:20.952
Anyway, Lois, I think
it's a non-starter tonight.

10:21.179 --> 10:22.436
I'm just gonna
go to the bathroom,

10:22.530 --> 10:25.014
look at pictures of barely-legal
Russian food on my iPad,

10:25.033 --> 10:27.167
and then go to bed.

10:31.373 --> 10:32.538
Okay, we're rolling.

10:32.633 --> 10:36.359
Hi, I'm Tony Award winner
Stewie Griffin-Styles.

10:36.378 --> 10:38.786
-What?
-It's called manifesting, Bri.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.047
Anyway,
everything I have and own

10:41.141 --> 10:42.882
is being left
to Rupert in a trust

10:43.034 --> 10:44.792
for when he gets sober.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.294
And no, Rupert, getting high
is not getting sober,

10:47.314 --> 10:49.797
I don't care if you found
the one AA group in town

10:49.816 --> 10:50.982
that tells you otherwise.

10:51.134 --> 10:52.667
Brian, are you getting
my right angle?

10:52.727 --> 10:54.377
You said you wanted it
from the left side.

10:54.396 --> 10:55.970
-You want it from the right?
-(sighs)

10:56.064 --> 10:58.047
The left angle is
the right side.

10:58.141 --> 10:59.565
-Okay, back to one.
-(Brian sighs)

10:59.718 --> 11:04.079
Stewie, you got a letter from
the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.999
Oh, my God, they've
accepted my application!

11:08.151 --> 11:10.001
I'm gonna get
my final wish granted!

11:10.153 --> 11:13.672
I get to meet the Philadelphia
Flyer's mascot, Gritty!

11:13.823 --> 11:15.581
Gritty, Gritty. Gritty.

11:15.734 --> 11:18.325
I'm not going to pee in a cup
for you, so stop asking.

11:18.420 --> 11:21.262
This was supposed to be my day
and you're ruining it.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.184
(sighs)

11:26.411 --> 11:28.912
You'll Venmo me for this,
too, I suppose?

11:28.930 --> 11:31.764
(opera music playing)

11:31.917 --> 11:33.082
Oh, Brian,
I'm glad you're here.

11:33.101 --> 11:35.768
Me and a bunch of other
buff cooties victims

11:35.862 --> 11:37.178
are gonna shut down
the third floor

11:37.197 --> 11:39.364
of a Bloomingdale's tomorrow.
What do you think?

11:41.593 --> 11:42.683
She's alive, right?

11:42.777 --> 11:44.018
Stewie, come on,
this is ridic...

11:44.037 --> 11:45.745
(music playing loudly)

11:45.855 --> 11:47.188
Do you mind this music, Bri?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.374
-Do you like opera?
-Not really.

11:49.525 --> 11:52.377
Oh, Bri, you really haven't
heard "The Wheels on the Bus"

11:52.528 --> 11:54.695
until you've heard it
in its original Italian.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.949
You've taken this
whole thing too far.

12:05.967 --> 12:07.392
I'm washing my hands
of your cooties.

12:07.619 --> 12:09.635
Which, had you done
in the first place,

12:09.730 --> 12:11.788
might have prevented all this.

12:11.806 --> 12:12.956
You see, Rupert?

12:13.049 --> 12:15.216
That's why I'm glad
you stopped drinking.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.277
You were that ugly.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.889

Aw, they sure do grow up fast,
don't they?

12:29.899 --> 12:31.824
Chris, have you
masturbated today?

12:31.977 --> 12:34.477
-No, ma'am.
-Well, get up there.

12:34.496 --> 12:36.588

My family's right inside.

12:40.986 --> 12:42.910
I thought you might want
some lunch.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.578
Joe's still on his stakeout

12:44.598 --> 12:47.215
and I know you like
wagon-wheel pasta.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.841
Of course I like
wagon-wheel pasta.

12:48.994 --> 12:50.602

14:03.659 --> 14:05.042
What have I done?

14:05.269 --> 14:06.252
This is all my fault.

14:06.404 --> 14:08.237
I drove my best friend away

14:08.331 --> 14:11.240
and now he's alone

Hey, guys,

14:31.930 --> 14:34.097
No. Have you checked
his Instagram?

14:34.115 --> 14:35.765
Of course.

14:35.783 --> 14:38.284
"Felt a little trepidation
about killing myself,

That's it.
He's in Burlington!

14:44.050 --> 14:45.441
Thanks, Chris.

He's gonna be so pissed.
I better hide.

15:13.488 --> 15:15.972
Hey, Bon, did you know
there's a difference

15:16.065 --> 15:17.640
between Tenth Street
and Tenth Avenue?

15:17.733 --> 15:20.476
Anyway, I may have bonered
the stakeout.

15:20.569 --> 15:22.754
Aw, thanks for
pre-chewing my meal, babe.

15:22.981 --> 15:26.165

my cloaca much easier that way.

So, anyway,

18:47.185 --> 18:48.942
When I was driving up here
to the clinic,

18:48.962 --> 18:50.444
I saw the leaves change.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.872
I tapped a maple tree
and milked a cow.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.040
I-I tried fresh cream
for the first time

18:55.135 --> 18:56.692
and went to
a writer's retreat.

18:56.785 --> 18:59.637
I met Margaret Atwood and
we foraged for wild mushrooms.

18:59.864 --> 19:02.365
Wow, sounds like you were
in a real rush to get here.

19:02.383 --> 19:04.958
The point is, I've got
a lot of life left in me,

19:05.052 --> 19:06.477
and so do you.

19:06.704 --> 19:07.903
Easy for you to say.

19:07.963 --> 19:09.147
You don't have
a terminal illness.

19:09.298 --> 19:11.357
Oh, for God's sake,
you don't have...

19:13.060 --> 19:14.986
Brian, what are you doing?
Don't touch that!

19:15.213 --> 19:16.637
That's the infected Play-Doh!

19:16.731 --> 19:18.322
Brian, no! Stop!

19:19.400 --> 19:21.808
There.
Now I have cooties, too.

19:21.903 --> 19:23.477
And I don't care.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.145
You... you don't?

19:25.165 --> 19:26.555
We all have cooties,

19:26.574 --> 19:29.650
whether it's illness
or loneliness or turning 70.

19:29.744 --> 19:31.002
Nothing is promised.

19:31.153 --> 19:32.837
We could get run over by a car.

19:33.064 --> 19:34.230
Or struck by lightning.

19:34.248 --> 19:36.365
We could be hit with
an unprecedented pandemic

19:36.417 --> 19:38.234
that the government is
slow to recognize,

19:38.252 --> 19:39.510
woefully unprepared for

19:39.662 --> 19:41.679
and then mismanages
with reckless incompetence.

19:41.830 --> 19:43.239
But that's all the more reason

19:43.257 --> 19:45.016
to appreciate
the time we do have.

19:45.167 --> 19:46.242
I mean, look around!

19:46.260 --> 19:48.427
Look at this room.
It's beautiful.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.096
Bri, did you eat
those mushrooms you found?

19:51.249 --> 19:53.858
Yeah. You actually look like
a very old witch right now.

19:54.085 --> 19:56.677
But I'm also just happy
to be alive...

19:56.696 --> 19:58.321
and you should be, too.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.258
You know what?
You're right, Brian.

20:02.351 --> 20:04.184
Too bad you can never
get that on the page,

20:04.278 --> 20:05.703
but that's profound.

20:05.930 --> 20:07.279
Hey, I changed my mind.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.540
I don't want
to do the procedure.

20:09.692 --> 20:10.875
My life isn't over.

20:11.026 --> 20:13.619
Why, I've only just begun.

20:13.771 --> 20:17.030
("We've Only Just Begun"
by the Carpenters begins)

20:17.050 --> 20:19.108
Stop it! Nope! Nope! Nope!
Can't afford it!

20:19.126 --> 20:20.885
Well, what can we afford?

20:21.112 --> 20:22.795
♪<i> Whoa, Black Betty,</i>
<i> bam-ba-lam</i> ♪

20:22.889 --> 20:24.555
♪<i> Whoa,</i>
<i> Black Betty, bam-ba-lam</i> ♪

20:24.782 --> 20:26.615
♪<i> Black Betty had a child,</i>
<i> bam-ba-lam</i> ♪

20:26.709 --> 20:28.142
♪<i> Damn thing gone wild,</i>
<i> bam-ba-lam.</i> ♪

20:32.640 --> 20:33.731
(indistinct chatter)

20:33.958 --> 20:35.549
Yeah, you, first question.
Go ahead.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.718
REPORTER:
Meg was noticeably absent
from the episode.

20:37.812 --> 20:39.962
-Was that a team decision or...
-Yeah, I'm not going to be

20:39.981 --> 20:41.239
answering
any questions about Meg.

20:41.390 --> 20:42.389
We'll be dealing
with Meg internally.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.799
-Over here.
-REPORTER 2: Do you think

20:43.892 --> 20:45.968
we'll be seeing more of
Peter and Bonnie teaming up?

20:46.061 --> 20:47.486
I thought it played
pretty well.

20:47.638 --> 20:48.895
Uh, we'll have to look
at the tape on that

20:48.915 --> 20:50.473
and, uh, make a decision
moving forward.

20:50.533 --> 20:52.157
-Yeah.
-H. JON BENJAMIN: You guys used
to be on at 9:00,

20:52.310 --> 20:54.310
now you're on at 9:30.
What happened with that?

20:54.328 --> 20:55.811
All right, I'm done here.

20:55.904 --> 20:57.997
This suit cost $40,000

20:58.149 --> 21:00.591
and I'm throwing it away
after this press conference.

21:00.743 --> 21:02.426
Okay, over here?
