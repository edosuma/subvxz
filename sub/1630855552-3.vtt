01:03.460 --> 01:05.832
Oh, sh...

01:05.832 --> 01:07.803
Damn.

01:07.803 --> 01:10.608
Son of a...

02:19.513 --> 02:21.517
Do any of them speak English?

02:21.517 --> 02:23.654
If they did,
they let on like they didn't.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.339
Ready, or need more time?

03:56.339 --> 03:57.909
Now, I can't decide
between them,

03:57.909 --> 04:01.049
so I'm gonna have
an apple pie and a cherry pie.

04:01.049 --> 04:03.621
Okay, slice of cherry,
slice of apple.

04:03.621 --> 04:05.892
No, not a slice.

04:05.892 --> 04:07.596
A whole pie.

04:07.596 --> 04:10.768
You want a whole cheery
and a whole apple?

04:10.768 --> 04:13.941
Yeah. Is that allowed?

04:13.941 --> 04:16.981
Okay. I wish I had
that kind of metabolism.

04:58.062 --> 05:00.099
Ooh!

07:32.905 --> 07:34.909
[music playing faint

07:39.719 --> 07:41.089
- Thank you.
- You got it, ma'am.

07:49.004 --> 07:50.808
Hey, man.

07:50.808 --> 07:53.948
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. You guys got
any chargers?

07:53.948 --> 07:56.052
- 20 bucks.
- The thing is,
I don't got any money.

07:56.052 --> 07:58.891
Is there, like,
just one I could borrow?

07:58.891 --> 08:01.162
- If possible?
- Nope.

08:01.162 --> 08:03.099
Thanks, anyways.

08:03.099 --> 08:05.772
Hey, handsome. Can I get you
something to drink?

08:05.772 --> 08:07.776
Yes, please.
Can I get some water?

08:07.776 --> 08:09.679
Thank you.

08:17.093 --> 08:18.964
Thank you.

08:24.241 --> 08:27.715
Psst. Psst.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.084
Come sit with me.

08:30.754 --> 08:32.090
Me?

08:33.159 --> 08:35.832
Yeah, you. Who else?

08:35.832 --> 08:37.902
Come on.

08:43.647 --> 08:45.584
Hi.

08:47.655 --> 08:50.026
I'm Bear.

08:50.026 --> 08:51.262
Yeah, I know.

08:51.262 --> 08:54.603
You do?

08:54.603 --> 08:55.738
Did my mom send you?

08:55.738 --> 08:57.241
Mm, no.

08:57.241 --> 08:59.846
Well, h-how do you know...

08:59.846 --> 09:02.284
Stop asking so many questions,
they give me a headache.

09:02.284 --> 09:05.657
Okay, yeah. Uh, my bad.

09:08.029 --> 09:09.231
You want some pie?

09:10.400 --> 09:12.371
Uh...

09:12.371 --> 09:15.143
- Yeah, I'll take some pie.
- That's what I thought.

09:15.143 --> 09:18.149
Hey, can I get an extra fork
and an extra plate, please?

09:18.149 --> 09:21.155
Told you that was a lot
for one person.

09:23.159 --> 09:25.263
Cherry for the lady.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.769
Are you a good man, Bear?

09:45.771 --> 09:48.878
I mean, I try to be.

09:48.878 --> 09:51.950
Yeah.

09:51.950 --> 09:55.892
Usually when I cross paths
with someone, there's a reason.

09:55.892 --> 09:57.862
So...

10:00.466 --> 10:03.072
You're not eating your pie.

10:03.072 --> 10:04.876
Um...

10:06.846 --> 10:08.884
Sorry.

10:14.729 --> 10:16.098
Oh. Ugh.

10:16.098 --> 10:17.969
My book.

10:17.969 --> 10:19.204
- I got it.
- Silly me.

10:38.276 --> 10:39.679
Here.

10:49.966 --> 10:51.369
Have some pie.

10:51.369 --> 10:53.339
You don't look so well.

10:56.378 --> 10:58.249
Are you here to kill me?

11:09.037 --> 11:11.976
You remind me of a boy
I once knew.

12:30.400 --> 12:34.308
Sisters, Mr. Minor knows
a lot about savages, don't you?

12:34.308 --> 12:37.447
- I do.
- And such a young man.

12:37.447 --> 12:39.217
I am that.

14:09.465 --> 14:11.937
So, what, then?
You heard of me your whole life?

14:11.937 --> 14:13.439
- Yeah.
- What did you think, I was fake?

14:13.439 --> 14:16.011
- Think I was make-believe?
- I-I just thought

14:16.011 --> 14:17.949
it was a story
to keep all the Uncles in line.

14:17.949 --> 14:20.019
Yeah, well, some Uncles
need more than stories

14:20.019 --> 14:21.623
to keep them in line.

14:21.623 --> 14:24.194
Those are the ones that I visit.

14:25.664 --> 14:29.071
Do you, uh...
do you kill women, too?

14:29.071 --> 14:31.441
I have. Bad ones.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.024
We'll take the check.

14:39.024 --> 14:40.326
You could pay at the register.

14:41.128 --> 14:43.099
What are you doing
out here, anyways?

14:43.099 --> 14:45.571
You lost?

14:45.571 --> 14:48.442
- Kind of.
- Aww.

14:48.442 --> 14:50.212
I'll take you home.

14:53.152 --> 14:56.291
I got to make a stop somewhere
first, though.

15:00.266 --> 15:01.936
Come on, honey bunny.

15:50.734 --> 15:52.136
Where are we?

15:56.345 --> 15:57.714
You don't have to come in.

15:59.451 --> 16:02.190
You can wait in the truck.

16:02.190 --> 16:03.993
So you're not gonna kill me?

16:12.745 --> 16:14.414
Relax.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.722
I'll be right back.

16:17.722 --> 16:20.125
Just listen to the radio.

16:26.371 --> 16:28.744
Holy fuck.

16:28.744 --> 16:31.549
Deer Lady's real.

17:19.110 --> 17:20.614
I'm coming.

17:56.552 --> 17:58.422
Let go of that!

18:37.366 --> 18:38.569
Hello, young lady.

18:40.774 --> 18:42.276
Hello.

18:46.519 --> 18:48.723
Best come in out of the cold.

18:52.765 --> 18:56.205
I-I'm sure you're thirsty, uh...

18:56.205 --> 18:57.607
I'll get you some water.

19:14.909 --> 19:16.813
Oh, shit.

19:16.813 --> 19:19.919
Come on, come on, come on.
Pick up.

19:19.919 --> 19:21.488
Mom?

19:21.488 --> 19:23.693
Fuck yes!

19:23.693 --> 19:25.396
Yeah, h... ok...
yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

19:25.396 --> 19:26.699
I'm okay, I'm...

19:26.699 --> 19:29.672
Look, Mom, I am so sorry,
all right?

19:29.672 --> 19:31.643
I, for real, got lost this time.

19:31.643 --> 19:33.647
Mom... I know, I'll explain
everything when I get home.

19:33.647 --> 19:34.882
Okay? I'll be home soon.

19:49.712 --> 19:51.281
Yeah.

19:54.320 --> 19:58.329
You caught me here
being nostalgic.

19:58.329 --> 20:01.903
Looking at these old pictures.

20:01.903 --> 20:03.940
You know, it's funny.

20:03.940 --> 20:06.645
It's all we leave, really.

20:08.583 --> 20:11.288
Ain't it? Pictures?

20:11.288 --> 20:14.393
Thank God we don't have pictures
of everything.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.805
We don't get
many visitors anymore.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.747
You're young.

20:23.747 --> 20:27.521
It must be strange

20:27.521 --> 20:29.992
seeing such an old man.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.436
She's running. She's running!

21:22.396 --> 21:24.034
You'll die out there!

21:24.034 --> 21:26.772
There's nothing out there
but the devil, child.

22:03.078 --> 22:05.584
We need to find them and soon.

22:05.584 --> 22:08.088
It gets dangerous out here
at night.

22:08.088 --> 22:09.592
Yep.

22:09.592 --> 22:11.996
Sister Jenson?!

22:14.500 --> 22:16.573
Haven't heard her in a while.

22:16.573 --> 22:18.108
Let's get her and go back.

22:18.108 --> 22:20.012
That girl's long gone by now.

22:20.012 --> 22:21.782
Eh, she'll die out here.

22:26.458 --> 22:27.794
Oh, my God.

22:29.732 --> 22:31.569
Jesus Christ.

22:44.060 --> 22:47.834
I-I have one son.

22:49.738 --> 22:51.843
He's pretty pathetic.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.621
It's all here.

22:58.623 --> 23:01.863
There's a whole life.

23:01.863 --> 23:03.599
Everything.

23:08.075 --> 23:11.014
I wasn't a good father.

23:11.014 --> 23:13.620
Was hardly around.

23:13.620 --> 23:17.026
I gave in to the drink
for most of my life.

23:17.026 --> 23:21.201
Eh, most men lived like me
would be dead by now.

Did you kill somebody
at that house?

26:45.910 --> 26:48.248
I killed a human wolf.

26:52.924 --> 26:55.061
You're gonna be okay, Bear.

26:56.732 --> 26:58.368
And don't you worry about
becoming your dad.

26:58.368 --> 27:00.372
Your mama saw to that.

27:02.443 --> 27:06.786
And remember to keep smiling.

27:06.786 --> 27:09.023
They can't stop you
from smiling.

27:15.870 --> 27:16.939
Adieu.

27:28.361 --> 27:29.732
Yeah!

27:29.732 --> 27:31.201
Yo, Bear, is that your new girl?

27:31.201 --> 27:33.338
She fine.

27:33.338 --> 27:35.911
- That was Deer Lady.
- Nuh-uh.

27:35.911 --> 27:37.446
Oh, man, we should've
gave her a CD.

27:37.446 --> 27:39.017
- For real, though.
- Good to see y'all again, man.

27:39.017 --> 27:41.021
Hey, man. You, too, man. Hey.

27:41.021 --> 27:42.758
You know your mom gonna
whup that butt, right?

27:42.758 --> 27:44.762
Man, I know.

27:44.762 --> 27:46.799
Hey, put everything in your back
pocket, it won't hurt as much.

27:46.799 --> 27:49.704
Check y'all later.
