01:07.317 --> 01:10.236
Everybody's got issues, you know?

01:10.236 --> 01:12.864
Well, life's not comfortable,

01:12.864 --> 01:14.199
it's not boring.

01:16.158 --> 01:17.243
You know, 'cause when
you're on the streets

01:17.243 --> 01:20.538
you never know what you'll
find around a corner,

01:20.538 --> 01:23.208

01:23.208 --> 01:25.627
You can make a left, you can make a right,

And...

01:29.631 --> 01:31.174
You know...

01:31.174 --> 01:33.843
But, well, you know, I'm
not scared of anything.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.887
Nothing scares me at all.

02:06.501 --> 02:10.839
Probably shouldn't have

02:12.173 --> 02:13.716
- [Davy] So are you gonna say something?

02:13.716 --> 02:15.552
- [Nate] What? I gotta say something?

02:15.552 --> 02:18.138
- [Davy] Well, it's a big bust.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.722
It's the cherry on top of your career.

02:19.722 --> 02:20.515
- [Nate] Yeah, sure.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.850
but they don't even have a conviction yet.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.144
C'mon, they don't even have a trial date.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.895
- [Davy] Yeah, but they
have all the evidence,

02:25.895 --> 02:27.397
it's a slam dunk.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.982
Everybody's gonna take credit

02:28.982 --> 02:31.818
so I think you should be at
least prepared to say something.

02:31.818 --> 02:32.652
- [Nate] Okay,

02:32.652 --> 02:33.903
how about all you paper
pushers get off the dais.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.655
Fuck you very much.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.699

You can't be lying here.

02:39.909 --> 02:42.620

02:42.620 --> 02:45.623
You need to go to the hospital? Huh?

02:48.001 --> 02:50.170

02:50.170 --> 02:51.588
Let's get him up.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.590
- Should we take him in?

02:53.590 --> 02:55.591
- What for? Let's just
get him out of here.

02:55.591 --> 02:58.052
- I think I have the shits. (burps)

02:58.052 --> 03:00.388
- There's a bar here with a restroom.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.974
Can you make it in there?
- I gotta stay with my stuff.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.893

03:04.893 --> 03:06.186

03:06.186 --> 03:07.854

03:13.985 --> 03:15.278

You want some? I'm off in an hour.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.287

that burger? It's on me.

think that order of fries

03:29.000 --> 03:30.335
entitles you to?

'cause you're just gonna sit there

11:51.168 --> 11:53.421
and stare at the glass for an hour.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.714
- Sometimes you gotta treat a whiskey

11:54.714 --> 11:56.132
like a beautiful woman, you know?

11:56.132 --> 11:57.466
You gotta stare at it a little bit,

11:57.466 --> 11:59.301
romance it a little bit because,

11:59.301 --> 12:01.303
you know, I didn't say
that, somebody else said it.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.847
- Hey, how are you doing?

12:02.847 --> 12:06.475
I'm Murray Adler, I own this place.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.437
- Speed, they call me Speed.

12:09.437 --> 12:14.066
- So Buddy tells me you're
a pretty frequent customer.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.484
- I suppose I am.

12:15.484 --> 12:18.070
- Yeah? Any reason why
you choose my place?

12:18.070 --> 12:20.448
- It's on my way home.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.032
- And where's home?

12:23.701 --> 12:24.744
- 5th Street.

12:24.744 --> 12:28.080
- 5th Street, under the bridge, 10 City?

12:31.292 --> 12:32.626
- You know there's another bar,

12:32.626 --> 12:36.088
that's even closer to where you're living.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.758
- I like your place.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.884
- And I appreciate that.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.927
- Although your clientele
could use a little cultivating.

12:41.927 --> 12:42.762
- The client could use...

12:42.762 --> 12:45.598
Are you listening to this asshole?

12:46.599 --> 12:47.558
- So what do you mean

12:47.558 --> 12:50.519
my clientele could use some cultivating?

12:50.519 --> 12:51.729
- Nothing, nothing.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.689
I'll just have my... I'll have my drink.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.317
- He's not gonna pour you a drink.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.860
Okay, listen to me, I'm
not gonna coddle you

12:57.860 --> 12:59.111
like my bartender, okay?

12:59.111 --> 13:01.906
I want you to leave, and
I want you to leave now.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.365
I think I'm being a nice guy.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.743
I'm asking nice, I think
I'm being very polite,

13:05.743 --> 13:09.872
but if you don't leave I'm
gonna have to call the cops.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.208
- There's not a good
reason not to serve me.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.709
- I don't need a reason, okay?

13:13.709 --> 13:15.127
Come on, let's...

13:17.421 --> 13:21.675
- Okay, I know this is not
my business, it's your place.

13:21.675 --> 13:22.510
I get it,

13:22.510 --> 13:25.513
It's just... It's bartender 101, okay?

13:25.513 --> 13:26.889
You just need a little bit of order here.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.432
You know, you put your
Bourbons with your Bourbons,

13:28.432 --> 13:29.934
and your scotch with your scotch,

13:29.934 --> 13:31.352
and your ryes with your ryes.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.561
You know, you don't want
people having to navigate

13:32.561 --> 13:34.313
through a maze of bottles
just to find a drink,

13:34.313 --> 13:36.273
and your limes, are full of brown edges.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.608
I mean, these weren't cut today,

13:37.608 --> 13:38.776
it's old, and people are gonna know

13:38.776 --> 13:40.736
that you use old product
and it doesn't look good.

13:40.736 --> 13:43.280
And some snacks, you
know? Some salty stuff.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.782
Just get some chips and some pretzels,

13:44.782 --> 13:47.117
salty stuff is cheap,
it makes people thirsty.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.410
And a little bit of entertainment,

13:48.410 --> 13:50.913
just a little bit of guitar,
a little bit of piano.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.456
- Okay.

13:52.456 --> 13:53.290
(chuckles)

13:53.290 --> 13:57.837
Can you just take it easy,
all right? For a second.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.171
- It'd be great.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.053
I used to be a bartender.

14:06.053 --> 14:06.887
(scoffs)

14:06.887 --> 14:08.430
- What'd you do? Drink the inventory?

14:08.430 --> 14:11.058
- No, I didn't drink the inventory.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.810
I got out of the army,

14:12.810 --> 14:15.771
I got a job, I got married,

14:15.771 --> 14:17.398
I lost my job, I got divorced.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.233
- [Buddy] Oh, I feel for you.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.235
- And I had friends, I
had drinking friends,

14:21.235 --> 14:23.362
(chuckles)

14:23.362 --> 14:25.239
until drinking became my only friend.

14:25.239 --> 14:28.993
- So, why do you keep
coming back here, right?

14:28.993 --> 14:30.744
Just like you said, you don't even like

14:30.744 --> 14:32.913
the way I run the place, right?

14:32.913 --> 14:35.749
I mean, you could do
far more with your money

14:35.749 --> 14:37.501
at any liquor store.

14:37.501 --> 14:41.338
- You collect cans for Christ's sake.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.423
- You don't know how much money I have,

14:42.423 --> 14:44.258
I got plenty of money.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.386
Enough for a drink,

14:47.386 --> 14:49.305
it's not enough for tip.
- I don't want your tip.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.514
- [Speed] You wanna know why I don't tip?

14:50.514 --> 14:51.724
- I don't care.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.601
- It's 'cause he waters down the booze.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.935
I know the taste of water

14:54.935 --> 14:56.395
as well as I know the taste of Jack,

14:56.395 --> 14:59.023
and I know when I'm
drinking watered down booze.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.610
- So why do you keep coming back here?

15:02.610 --> 15:04.695
- I used to drink, a lot,

15:06.697 --> 15:07.573
but ever since coming here

15:07.573 --> 15:09.742
and drinking Buddy's watered down booze,

15:09.742 --> 15:12.036
it's been a little like rehab.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.164
And I think in just a little
bit, a little bit, just a week,

15:15.164 --> 15:17.750
I'll have it, I'll be dry.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.628
- Why don't you just go home
and water down your own liquor?

15:20.628 --> 15:23.255
Who comes to a bar to get sober?

15:23.255 --> 15:24.757
That's just crazy.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.595
- Out there, when I drink

15:29.595 --> 15:32.932
I'm just a homeless guy getting drunk.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.808
Here, when I saddle up to the bar,

15:34.808 --> 15:37.895
when I saddle up to your bar, it's...

15:38.938 --> 15:41.106
I'm somebody, here I'm somebody.

15:41.106 --> 15:44.109
- Nope, still just a homeless dude,

15:44.109 --> 15:45.694
and you stink.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.697
And that's why you gotta go.

15:48.697 --> 15:51.200
- You wanna know why
else I like coming here?

15:51.200 --> 15:53.118
It's 'cause here I can look across the bar

15:53.118 --> 15:54.286
and look down at somebody else.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.496
You know, I might be living on the street,

15:55.496 --> 15:58.665
but at least I'm not a thief, okay?

15:58.665 --> 16:00.417
- Hey, back off!

16:00.417 --> 16:01.710
- I don't have to listen to this shit.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.712
- Get outta here.

16:03.712 --> 16:05.798
Jesus! Are you all right?

16:09.969 --> 16:10.970
I'm sorry that you feel

16:10.970 --> 16:12.721
Buddy's watering down your drinks, okay?

16:12.721 --> 16:15.015
I have to think of my bottom line,

16:15.015 --> 16:16.767
it's just business, right pal?

16:16.767 --> 16:19.937
- Just one more. One more and I'll go.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.148
(sighs)

16:27.152 --> 16:28.070
- One more.

16:30.948 --> 16:34.284
(pensive music playing)

16:38.706 --> 16:41.375
(drink pouring)

16:47.172 --> 16:48.424
- For you, sir.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.305
I have appreciated your hospitality.

16:55.305 --> 16:58.100
♪ Lord lift me up ♪

16:58.100 --> 17:01.687
♪ I've stayed far enough ♪

17:01.687 --> 17:05.482
♪ Gather my soul with love ♪

17:05.482 --> 17:10.112

17:10.112 --> 17:13.240

17:16.827 --> 17:20.664

17:20.664 --> 17:23.916
♪ Freedom at last ♪

17:23.916 --> 17:24.835
(upbeat music)

17:24.835 --> 17:28.547
- I don't even want you
stepping near my place.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.007
Because I don't need a bum like you

17:30.007 --> 17:32.551
ruining my business, how's that?

17:32.551 --> 17:33.886
Are you kidding me?

17:33.886 --> 17:34.803
Can you believe this guy?

17:34.803 --> 17:35.679
- Some people.
(chuckling)

17:35.679 --> 17:37.139
- [Murray] Jesus!

17:37.139 --> 17:39.808
(bottle hisses)

17:39.808 --> 17:40.642
- You never know what you're gonna find

17:40.642 --> 17:42.311
when you turn a corner.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.938
Look at me, all cleaned up.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.565
I'm a man reborn, who now pours drinks

17:46.565 --> 17:50.235
for the financially
solvent, privileged people.

17:50.235 --> 17:54.156
Doesn't get much more
obladi-oblada than that.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.283
And behind this bar,

17:56.283 --> 17:59.244
you look like a priest, you know?

17:59.244 --> 18:00.829
I'll listen to your woes

18:00.829 --> 18:03.082
and dole out 80 proof indulgences.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.167
(drinks fizzling)

18:05.167 --> 18:07.002
Or you can act a fool,

18:09.880 --> 18:12.466
sorta like I'm in a confession.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.887
I hear all, my lips are sealed,

18:16.887 --> 18:19.431
and I don't make any
judgments, no judgments,

18:19.431 --> 18:20.682
unless I'm asked.

18:20.682 --> 18:21.809
- [Man 5] You voted for an asshole

18:21.809 --> 18:22.643
- So you can ask.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.062
Hey, you guys need some nuts?

18:26.313 --> 18:28.732
(calm music)

18:41.995 --> 18:43.789
Nobody likes to be alone.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.374
I mean, some people say
that it's an opportunity

18:45.374 --> 18:47.835
to find themselves, but...

18:47.835 --> 18:49.336
That's bullshit

18:49.336 --> 18:50.921
If somebody tells you that
they like to be alone,

18:50.921 --> 18:53.590
it's more than likely
that nobody likes them,

18:53.590 --> 18:55.884
or just as likely that
they don't like you,

18:55.884 --> 18:59.471
because nobody likes to be alone.

18:59.471 --> 19:02.558
(calm music playing)

19:08.730 --> 19:09.731
- Yeah.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.067
And, I'd love you to see it.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.782
I need to go talk to a colleague,

19:18.782 --> 19:20.993
can you just give me one second?

19:20.993 --> 19:21.827
I'll be right back.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.620
- Fine.
- I'll be right back for you.

19:23.620 --> 19:24.454
- You better be.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.707
(chuckles)

19:27.583 --> 19:29.001
- Didi.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.836
- Oh, hi Milo.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.462
- How have you been?

19:32.462 --> 19:33.589
- Good.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.508
- Oh, with the way the market
is, I guess good's good.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.677
- Well, maybe just okay.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.429
- Okay. Okay is good.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.850
- So let's catch up.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.393
- Catch up?

19:46.393 --> 19:47.394
- Gin tonic?

19:48.478 --> 19:49.313
(sighs)

19:49.313 --> 19:50.480
- I'm buying.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.149
- No, not right now.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.444
- Wasn't your hair longer before?

19:55.444 --> 19:58.572
- Yeah, I cut it two weeks ago.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.115
- Well, it's great,

20:00.115 --> 20:02.117
and you've lost weight.

20:02.117 --> 20:02.951
(chuckles)

20:02.951 --> 20:04.494
- I wish.

20:04.494 --> 20:05.954
- Well, you look great,

20:05.954 --> 20:07.873
and you're doing well for yourself.

20:07.873 --> 20:08.749
- How's that?

20:08.749 --> 20:11.418
- I see you driving the new Mercedes.

20:11.418 --> 20:16.298
- Hey, you know anyone that
wants to take over a lease?

20:16.298 --> 20:18.008
- So anything new on the market,

20:18.008 --> 20:19.885
or anything I should know about?

20:19.885 --> 20:21.553
- Not really.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.555
- You need listings, Dina.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.808
Buyers, sellers, you need to advertise.

20:27.851 --> 20:30.312
To make money you gotta spend money.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.106
- To spend money, you have to have money.

20:33.106 --> 20:36.109
But I've got a new flyer coming out.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.071
- Okay.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.405
Very old school.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.701
You need a polished
website, link in, network,

20:44.701 --> 20:47.913
but paper still has its place.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.665
Four-fold raise type.

20:50.958 --> 20:51.792
Nice, huh?

20:53.794 --> 20:54.628
- Hmm.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.131
Expensive.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.969
- Keep it. It's a new pocket listing

21:01.969 --> 21:03.971
on a $5 mil remodel in Mulholland.

21:03.971 --> 21:07.474
This place, top of the grade; Pool, view,

21:07.474 --> 21:11.645
five bedrooms, wine
cellar, even a theater.

21:11.645 --> 21:15.065
It's pricey to sell, but, you never know.

21:17.693 --> 21:21.863
Look, if I don't have a
buyer in a couple of days,

21:24.491 --> 21:27.661
would do you wanna sit by Mulholland?

21:27.661 --> 21:31.415
You'll pick up buyers, high rollers.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.000
- Sure, absolutely.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.714
- See, I don't wanna be
dealing with a lot of grazers

21:38.714 --> 21:40.716
in the office, you know?

21:42.551 --> 21:43.385
Just you.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.476
Are we good?

21:52.602 --> 21:53.437
- Yeah.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.567
- I wanna be friends, Didi.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.407
Maybe we could, uh...

22:05.407 --> 22:08.243
(Kasha chuckling)

22:09.202 --> 22:10.537
go out sometime.

22:11.663 --> 22:12.748
- Yeah, sure.

22:14.666 --> 22:18.503
- So, about the Mulholland,
I'm doing you one,

22:19.504 --> 22:22.090
I need you to do me one.

22:22.090 --> 22:23.300
- One what?

22:23.300 --> 22:24.634
- I need a favor.

22:24.634 --> 22:25.802
- Look, if there's anything that I can do-

22:25.802 --> 22:27.554
- I need to borrow your
car for a couple hours.

22:27.554 --> 22:28.513
- My car?

22:28.513 --> 22:30.057
- Just for a couple of hours.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.059
Didi, I'm doing you one.

22:33.143 --> 22:37.397
And if you bring me a buyer
on the Mulholland, hey,

22:38.607 --> 22:40.484
it's real money.

22:40.484 --> 22:41.818
Come on, please.

22:44.905 --> 22:47.616
(keys jingle)

22:47.616 --> 22:49.951
- What happened to your car?

22:51.953 --> 22:54.122
- I don't have it tonight.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.209
Look, do me one, please.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.048
(sighs)

23:03.048 --> 23:04.716
You're a sweetheart, thank you.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.760
Look, Saturday, you and I go

23:06.760 --> 23:08.762
for a ride in the Porsche, yeah?

23:08.762 --> 23:09.596
- You're gonna have your sports car

23:09.596 --> 23:11.598
fixed up by this weekend?

23:11.598 --> 23:12.516
- Fixed up?

23:13.392 --> 23:14.810
(slurps drink)

23:14.810 --> 23:16.061
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

23:16.061 --> 23:18.146
it's not in the shop, it's at home.

23:18.146 --> 23:22.025
- Then, why don't you just
drive home and switch cars?

23:22.025 --> 23:24.111
- Because... Evie's home.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.784
You remember Evie?

23:30.784 --> 23:31.618
- Evie?

23:32.577 --> 23:34.871
Nope, I don't know Evie.

23:34.871 --> 23:38.250
- Yeah, you do. You met her at the, uh...

23:38.250 --> 23:39.084
What's that place?

23:39.084 --> 23:41.420
No, maybe you weren't there.

23:42.879 --> 23:45.298
Anyway, I told her, you know,

23:45.298 --> 23:46.633
I needed to go furniture shopping,

23:46.633 --> 23:48.510
and she told me to take the minivan.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.470
It's my fuck up.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.514
- Evie's your girlfriend?

23:52.514 --> 23:54.474
- Yeah, we're sort of engaged

23:54.474 --> 23:56.017
- Engaged.

23:56.017 --> 23:58.437
Look Milo, I've got a huge deductible.

23:58.437 --> 23:59.604
- Don't worry about your car,

23:59.604 --> 24:03.150
nothing's gonna happen to your car, okay?

24:03.150 --> 24:05.652
Look, have a few drinks on me.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.532
- I don't drink.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.036
Who's your client?

24:16.204 --> 24:18.415
(chuckling)

24:18.415 --> 24:22.043
- I'll show it to her, and be right back.

24:22.043 --> 24:23.545
Hey, you're a gem.

24:28.216 --> 24:32.512
(enchanting guitar playing)

24:32.512 --> 24:34.598
- This place white bear's skin rug,

24:34.598 --> 24:37.726
with picture perfect
views of the Pacific Ocean

24:37.726 --> 24:41.396
(enchanting guitar playing)

25:27.275 --> 25:29.236
- [Speed] The world's full
of bastards, isn't it?

25:29.236 --> 25:30.070
- What?

25:31.112 --> 25:34.658
- I asked if you'd like anything else?

25:34.658 --> 25:36.701
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

25:36.701 --> 25:40.080
I can roll the clock on
back to happy for you.

25:40.080 --> 25:40.997
Happy hour?

25:42.874 --> 25:45.293
- All right, rum and coke.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.419
- A lemy.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.588
- No, just make it a Coke.

25:49.839 --> 25:51.633
- Just a Coke.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.511
- Yeah, I can drink, or not drink.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.428
- No, it's okay.

25:55.428 --> 25:56.930
It's just, I've never
seen you order any alcohol

25:56.930 --> 25:59.558
and I figured you're
either a Mormon or a Muslim

25:59.558 --> 26:02.143
without the head thing.

26:02.143 --> 26:03.728
- Well, both my parents were alcoholics,

26:03.728 --> 26:05.146
so I don't drink.

26:07.023 --> 26:10.193
I don't like the genetic risk factors.

26:11.486 --> 26:14.614
- Genetics, that's the excuse.

26:14.614 --> 26:16.241
It's just that everybody's got a vice,

26:16.241 --> 26:18.368
you know, everybody's addicted
to something, you know?

26:18.368 --> 26:22.789
Whether it's drinking,
smoking, overeating, drugs.

26:22.789 --> 26:26.501
I figure you pick one vice and enjoy,

26:26.501 --> 26:28.253
because believe you me, if
you pound down one vice,

26:28.253 --> 26:31.715
another one pops back up in its place.

26:31.715 --> 26:35.885
So if you'd like a drink,
you should have a drink.

26:37.470 --> 26:39.389
- Okay, Screwdriver.

26:39.389 --> 26:42.183
- Screwdriver coming up!

26:42.183 --> 26:45.270
- No, just make it a Virgin, just OJ.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.107
- All right.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.830
You know, I hate to lose a good customer,

27:03.830 --> 27:07.375
but a wise man once told me
that coming and sitting at a bar

27:07.375 --> 27:08.501
when you're trying to stay sober

27:08.501 --> 27:11.588
is not the smartest of things.

27:11.588 --> 27:15.925
- I'm waiting for somebody
to come back with my car.

27:18.595 --> 27:21.681
(calm music playing)

27:25.769 --> 27:28.855
(indistinct chatter)

27:33.818 --> 27:36.237
(door opens)

27:38.156 --> 27:41.076
(enchanting music)

27:50.877 --> 27:52.796
- Give me vodka.

27:52.796 --> 27:56.132
No, (indistinct) vodka.

27:59.135 --> 28:02.931
♪ My love is a storm ♪

28:02.931 --> 28:06.393
♪ She doesn't wait for me ♪

28:06.393 --> 28:10.188
♪ And now that she's gone ♪

28:10.188 --> 28:14.693
♪ I feel that she'll never be ♪

28:14.693 --> 28:16.736
What are you drinking?

28:16.736 --> 28:18.113
- Orange juice.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.489
- Screwdriver?

28:19.489 --> 28:21.908
- No, it's just orange juice.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.997
♪ Orange juice, oh nice ♪

28:27.997 --> 28:29.624
♪ Tu du du ♪

28:29.624 --> 28:32.043
♪ Orange juice is nice ♪

28:32.043 --> 28:33.878
♪ Tu du du du du ♪

28:33.878 --> 28:36.965
♪ Orange juice, oh nice ♪

28:36.965 --> 28:39.509
- Old commercial, huh?

28:39.509 --> 28:40.885
My name is Viktor.

28:40.885 --> 28:43.221
- I'm not much in the mood
for socializing tonight.

28:43.221 --> 28:47.058
- Oh, do I look like I
came here for a hookup?

28:48.351 --> 28:49.936
I'm being friendly.

28:51.187 --> 28:53.815
- I'm sorry, I'm Dina.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.483
- Where are you from, Dina?

28:55.483 --> 28:57.026
- Here.

28:57.026 --> 28:59.404
- But, where do you come from?

28:59.404 --> 29:02.198
- Covina, I was born in Covina.

29:02.198 --> 29:06.327
- Okay, but your family,
where does it come from?

29:06.327 --> 29:08.913
- They moved to Covina from West Covina.

29:08.913 --> 29:13.168
- Okay, um, long, long,
long time ago, your family,

29:16.171 --> 29:18.256
they were Indians?

29:18.256 --> 29:19.841
Or were they immigrants?

29:19.841 --> 29:22.051
- Where do they come from?

29:22.051 --> 29:26.181
I was told that my great,
maybe, great, great grandfather,

29:26.181 --> 29:28.516
came from the Ukraine.

29:28.516 --> 29:31.853
- Ukraine, I knew it. We're compatriots.

29:39.277 --> 29:41.988
- Are we? Where are you from?

29:41.988 --> 29:42.947
- Are you ICE?

29:42.947 --> 29:43.782
- What?

29:43.782 --> 29:44.616
- Immigration?

29:44.616 --> 29:45.867
- No.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.827
- You have to tell me
if you are, you know?

29:47.827 --> 29:48.745
- I'm not.

29:48.745 --> 29:51.498
- So you're not ICE, no police, state, or

29:51.498 --> 29:52.874
(speaking in foreign language)

29:52.874 --> 29:54.000
- Definitely not...

29:54.000 --> 29:55.376
(mumbling)

29:55.376 --> 29:58.546
- Look at you, mutilating my language.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.299
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.218
- You hashtag, killed it.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.761
(chuckles)

30:04.761 --> 30:06.221
- Are you a Russian?

30:06.221 --> 30:07.472
- Ah, you know.

30:12.268 --> 30:14.062
What do you do, Dina?

30:14.062 --> 30:17.982
- Me? I sell real estate, I'm a realtor.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.819
- That's cool, I like real estate.

30:21.861 --> 30:26.491
You put a picture on the
wall, a bed in the bedroom,

30:26.491 --> 30:28.076
a woman on the bed,

30:29.118 --> 30:30.537
it's called home.

30:34.249 --> 30:36.543
I had a lot of houses.

30:36.543 --> 30:39.212
Hey, bring one more orange juice

30:41.297 --> 30:44.259
for my friend from Ukraine.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.928
(glasses clink)

30:50.181 --> 30:52.517
I'm a salesman too.

30:52.517 --> 30:53.351
- Hmm.

30:53.351 --> 30:54.936
- I sell favors

30:54.936 --> 30:57.230
- Like party favors?

30:57.230 --> 31:01.025
- Like, I make you a
favor and you pay for it.

31:01.025 --> 31:03.611
If it's a party you want,
I can give you a party.

31:03.611 --> 31:04.737
You want a party?

31:04.737 --> 31:06.281
- No, no.
(chuckles)

31:06.281 --> 31:08.157
I don't need a party.

31:08.157 --> 31:10.243
- What do you need, Dina?

31:12.203 --> 31:13.037
- Nothing?

31:15.164 --> 31:17.667
Well, buyers, I need buyers.

31:17.667 --> 31:18.585
- Buyers.

31:18.585 --> 31:22.922
- Yeah, you know, for real
estate? Buyers for houses.

31:22.922 --> 31:26.301
- I know buyers. What do you have?

31:26.301 --> 31:29.721
- Well, right now, I don't really have...

31:31.306 --> 31:35.143
Yes, I do! I have a new
listing on Mulholland.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.982
But it's expensive, $5 million.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.525
- That's not expensive.

31:42.525 --> 31:43.860
- It's not?

31:43.860 --> 31:46.613
No, it's not, and it's a bargain.

31:47.697 --> 31:52.201
- This house of yours, does
it have a bowling alley?

31:52.201 --> 31:53.745
- No.

31:53.745 --> 31:57.373
- I like to bowl, my friends like to bowl.

31:57.373 --> 32:00.752
- Maybe you could put a bowling alley in?

32:02.211 --> 32:03.796
The place has a wine cellar.

32:03.796 --> 32:05.632
- Yeah, I like wine.

32:05.632 --> 32:06.716
- And a movie theater.

32:06.716 --> 32:08.551
- Oh, I like The Rock.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.138
- Who doesn't?

32:12.138 --> 32:16.392
- The gentlemen, he
calls himself Dwayne now.

32:16.392 --> 32:18.895
It's his name, but I like him.

32:21.230 --> 32:22.482
Okay, tomorrow.

32:23.858 --> 32:28.321
You're gonna call me, I'm
gonna bring my friends.

32:28.321 --> 32:30.782
We're going to be your buyers.

32:30.782 --> 32:33.076
- That'd be great.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.244
(patting)

32:36.537 --> 32:39.874
- See? I just did you a favor.

32:39.874 --> 32:42.877
It would be nice if
you did one for me too.

32:42.877 --> 32:45.338
- Oh boy, another favor.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.757
Somebody already has my car.

32:47.757 --> 32:50.635
- Why would I need your car?

32:50.635 --> 32:52.053
- I don't know.

32:52.053 --> 32:52.887
- Dina,

32:57.517 --> 33:02.522
you are a woman that comes to
a bar and drinks orange juice,

33:03.815 --> 33:06.109
you don't care what people think.

33:06.109 --> 33:10.571
You don't drink, you stay
sharp, you make deals.

33:10.571 --> 33:12.699
- Yeah, that's me.

33:12.699 --> 33:16.077
- So half an hour ago, my friend tells me

33:16.077 --> 33:17.996
that he had seen Kasha,

33:19.038 --> 33:21.958
my beautiful, little Kasha,

33:21.958 --> 33:24.293
leave this place with a man.

33:25.420 --> 33:26.879
- Hm-hmm.

33:26.879 --> 33:28.840
- You would have noticed her.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.675
- Well, I've just been
sitting here working.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.511
- Yes, but you would have noticed her.

33:33.511 --> 33:34.345
She is...

33:35.346 --> 33:36.472
- I don't notice those things.

33:36.472 --> 33:38.349
- No, of course not, of course not,

33:38.349 --> 33:42.729
but she doesn't blend in,
you would have noticed her.

33:42.729 --> 33:46.607
So have you seen this
man that she walked with?

33:47.525 --> 33:48.901
- Jeez.

33:48.901 --> 33:51.195
- Talk to me, my compatriot.

33:53.656 --> 33:56.868
- Viktor, I don't wanna get
anybody in any kind of trouble.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.953
Maybe they just went to see a movie.

33:58.953 --> 34:01.247
- There is no Dwayne playing.

34:01.247 --> 34:02.790
- Or bowling?

34:02.790 --> 34:03.916
(wrapper rustling)

34:03.916 --> 34:06.335
- She doesn't have any balls.

34:08.920 --> 34:13.676
You have friends and you have
enemies, no one in between.

34:15.511 --> 34:16.637
Are you my friend?

34:16.637 --> 34:17.889
- I'd like to be.

34:17.889 --> 34:21.893
- Of course, who wouldn't
wanna be my friend?

34:21.893 --> 34:25.813
- Viktor, I just... I don't
wanna see anybody get, killed.

34:25.813 --> 34:26.606
- Killed?

34:28.190 --> 34:30.650
Is that what you think
of me, that I'm a killer?

34:30.650 --> 34:32.235
I don't kill people.

34:32.235 --> 34:33.821
I'm like a teacher.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.199
I teach them lessons.

34:37.199 --> 34:38.534
- Yeah, but...

34:38.534 --> 34:41.079
- Oh, that's for my protection.

34:43.206 --> 34:47.918
Second amendment, I like
the first one even better;

34:47.918 --> 34:49.378
No search without a warrant.

34:49.378 --> 34:50.213
(chuckles nervously)

34:50.213 --> 34:52.422
But if you want my promise,

34:55.176 --> 34:57.345
this is my promise to you.

35:06.771 --> 35:07.730
What is this?

35:07.730 --> 35:08.648
- My new listing.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.483
- I know, tomorrow.

35:10.483 --> 35:13.528
- Viktor, go, go right now,

35:13.528 --> 35:15.780
and check out this listing.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.951
Picture yourself on a white, bear skin rug

35:19.951 --> 35:24.497
with picture perfect views
of the Pacific Ocean.

35:24.497 --> 35:27.834
I think you'll find what you like there.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.462
- You know, for some events in life,

36:13.462 --> 36:16.007
it's the right place at the right time.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.676
Others, wrong place, wrong time,

36:20.428 --> 36:24.432
and sometimes they're the
same place, same time.

36:25.641 --> 36:26.934
- I just got a new client.

36:26.934 --> 36:28.936
- Yeah? What do you do?

36:29.812 --> 36:31.814
- I do people favors.

36:31.814 --> 36:34.734
(enchanting music)

(dramatic music)

36:48.164 --> 36:51.250
(ice cubes clinking)

37:02.929 --> 37:03.763
- Hi.

37:04.722 --> 37:05.556
Hi, hi.

37:06.641 --> 37:10.895
I'm looking for a Nate
Vigil, old guy suit and tie.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.066
- I think he's in the restroom.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.359
- Thank you.

37:16.359 --> 37:19.445
(jazz music playing)

37:36.003 --> 37:37.421
Nate, Nate Vigil?

37:38.589 --> 37:39.924
- Do I know you?

37:44.011 --> 37:45.513
District Attorney's office.

37:45.513 --> 37:49.016
- The B'nai Simpson case, it
goes to grand jury next week.

37:49.016 --> 37:50.726
I'm handling it.

37:50.726 --> 37:52.478
- Well, you're awfully young to be an ADA.

37:52.478 --> 37:54.814
- Well, you're awfully old to be a cop.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.482
(scoffs)

37:56.482 --> 37:59.527
I went to the evidence locker today.

37:59.527 --> 38:00.361
- Yeah?

38:00.361 --> 38:01.195
- Yeah.

38:02.863 --> 38:04.115
- Okay?

38:04.115 --> 38:07.201
- And there's $20,000 missing.

38:07.201 --> 38:08.536
- Bullshit,

38:08.536 --> 38:10.204
- You're surprised.

38:10.204 --> 38:12.039
- Yeah, I'm surprised.

38:14.041 --> 38:15.418
- Well?

38:15.418 --> 38:17.211
- Well, what?

38:17.211 --> 38:18.713
Do you think I took the money?

38:18.713 --> 38:20.423
- You signed for it.

38:20.423 --> 38:23.134
- I didn't take any money.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.720
- Well, okay. It's not my job,

38:25.720 --> 38:27.555
but the detectives will be looking into it

38:27.555 --> 38:29.390
when I bring it up tomorrow.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.517
- Oh, and why are you telling me this?

38:31.517 --> 38:33.311
- You may not remember, but you caught

38:33.311 --> 38:34.979
a skinny, fouled mouthed teenager,

38:34.979 --> 38:36.647
with a bunch of stolen credit cards,

38:36.647 --> 38:39.900
and you gave me a second chance.

38:39.900 --> 38:41.152
- No, that doesn't sound like me.

38:41.152 --> 38:41.986
- Yeah, it was you.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.988
- You tossed every, fuck you, I gave you,

38:43.988 --> 38:45.531
with a, fuck you right back.

38:45.531 --> 38:48.075
- That sounds like me.

38:48.075 --> 38:49.577
- I got my act together.

38:49.577 --> 38:53.331
I went to college, law
school, and here I am.

38:54.457 --> 38:57.918
- Yeah, well, I'm a big
fan of affirmative action.

38:57.918 --> 39:01.464
- Look, I'm here because I owed you one.

39:01.464 --> 39:05.009
So I suppose if the money
was there in the morning,

39:05.009 --> 39:06.093
I wouldn't know it was missing.

39:06.093 --> 39:07.011
- I didn't take any money.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.763
- It's not my problem.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.264
- What am I supposed to do?

39:10.264 --> 39:13.267
- You're a detective, figure it out.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.026
(sighs)

39:24.320 --> 39:25.154
- Fuck me.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.708
- I'm not an athlete, never had been,

39:38.834 --> 39:39.919
but when I was in high school

39:39.919 --> 39:42.630
my dad had me go out for boxing classes.

39:42.630 --> 39:43.756
He though it would make a man out of me.

39:43.756 --> 39:45.674
So, I took the classes,

39:47.885 --> 39:51.013
and I got the hell beat out of me.

39:51.013 --> 39:56.018
I got my nose broke, I got
knocked out, numerous times,

39:56.435 --> 39:57.770
lost on decisions,

39:57.770 --> 40:00.898
for all intents and
purposes, I was a loser.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.942
And I can't tell you how many times

40:02.942 --> 40:06.529
I was in my corner, that
I didn't wanna get out.

40:06.529 --> 40:09.573
There was no way I was
gonna beat the other guy,

40:09.573 --> 40:11.450
and I was hurting.

40:11.450 --> 40:13.702
So my father, he would, uh,

40:13.702 --> 40:15.413
he would shove me out there.

40:15.413 --> 40:19.708
If you're still standing,
he said, you got a chance.

40:22.086 --> 40:26.632
Might've been the only thing
he was ever right about.

40:26.632 --> 40:29.802
- Of course, we can do the
salmon, Frankie. It's fine.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.053
(enchanting music)

40:31.053 --> 40:32.805
No, I just think our guest would prefer

40:32.805 --> 40:35.808
the grilled miso, instead
of the mustard tail.

40:35.808 --> 40:36.934
Yeah.

40:36.934 --> 40:39.854
Oh, we are so simpatico right now.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.272
I love you.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.815
I love you more.

40:42.815 --> 40:44.733
I love you, infinity.

40:44.733 --> 40:45.651
I gotta go.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.029
- You've seen my specs?

40:50.906 --> 40:51.740
Oh shit.

40:53.993 --> 40:54.994
- I'm sorry.

40:56.704 --> 40:59.748
- Goddammit Davy, this is the second pair

40:59.748 --> 41:01.292
that you've fucked up for me.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.210
- I know, I'm sorry. I'll
buy you another pair.

41:03.210 --> 41:05.421
- You're goddamn right you will.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.298
What's the matter with you?

41:07.298 --> 41:09.800
What, are you preoccupied about what?

41:09.800 --> 41:11.135
- Wedding plans.

41:12.595 --> 41:14.346
- Oh, wedding, right.

41:15.806 --> 41:17.641
Expensive, I bet, huh?

41:18.601 --> 41:22.897
- Not really. No, just...
We're keeping it intimate.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.526
- Come on, Davy.

41:28.944 --> 41:30.779
- All right, it's a
couple of hundred people.

41:30.779 --> 41:31.614
(scoffs)

41:31.614 --> 41:35.701
- But Frankie's family's
paying for most of this.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.330
What's the matter?

41:41.207 --> 41:43.792
- I got some issues down
at the station, that's all.

41:43.792 --> 41:44.877
Things I gotta figure out.

41:44.877 --> 41:45.711
- Like what?

41:45.711 --> 41:47.671
- Just things, all right? Just things.

41:47.671 --> 41:48.672
- All right.

41:54.053 --> 41:56.222
- Oh, goddammit, the cold.

41:57.389 --> 41:59.725
- Are you gonna go to the dentist?

41:59.725 --> 42:00.809
- Eventually.

42:03.562 --> 42:04.396
Maybe.

42:06.106 --> 42:08.943
No. No, I'm not gonna pay
thousands for implants.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.695
Remember, flossing will do.

42:11.695 --> 42:15.199
- Sure, floss, that outta take care of it.

42:18.244 --> 42:21.330
- [Police Radio] 342,
342, respond code 275.

42:21.330 --> 42:25.042
Assault, domestic, 4271
Pepperwood Drive, Mulholland,

42:25.042 --> 42:26.627
witness called 911.

42:27.753 --> 42:28.754
- That's us?

42:30.256 --> 42:31.090
- Sit.

42:36.178 --> 42:37.012
Wait.

42:43.519 --> 42:45.563
- [Police Radio] Suspect
described as white male,

42:45.563 --> 42:49.733
six foot, early 30s, wearing
a red leather jacket.

42:52.528 --> 42:55.906
- [Fraser] 344, cancel 343,
we're en route to handle it.

42:55.906 --> 42:56.740
- It's Fraser.

42:56.740 --> 42:57.575
- Yeah.

42:59.159 --> 43:01.829
343, roger, canceling run, 10-8.

43:04.582 --> 43:08.836
I knew Fraser would take
it, Fraser is a zelon.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.170
- [Davy] But we were closer.

43:10.170 --> 43:12.381
- I don't like to go on domestics,

43:12.381 --> 43:14.883
you can put yourself in
the crap bath in six months

43:14.883 --> 43:17.553
after I've retired, and
at home on the couch.

43:17.553 --> 43:20.306
But right now, no domestics.

43:20.306 --> 43:21.390
- [Waiter] Ready to eat?

43:21.390 --> 43:22.224
- Yeah.

43:24.893 --> 43:27.187
Just get the patty melt.

43:27.187 --> 43:28.522
You like the patty melt?

43:28.522 --> 43:29.815
- Yeah, yeah, patty melt.

43:29.815 --> 43:33.068
- Two patty melts, fries, extra crispy,

43:34.153 --> 43:36.530
but put them on a paper towel to soak up

43:36.530 --> 43:38.824
as much of the grease as possible.

43:38.824 --> 43:39.700
- [Waiter] You got it.

43:39.700 --> 43:40.701
- Thank you.

43:42.161 --> 43:43.829
(sighs)

43:43.829 --> 43:45.414
The arthritis meds?

43:46.582 --> 43:47.750
- No, I ran out of those,

43:47.750 --> 43:51.420
this is for the ulcers that
my arthritis meds caused,

43:51.420 --> 43:54.506
and for the other shit that happened.

43:59.928 --> 44:03.015
Did you sign up for that
401k we talked about?

44:03.015 --> 44:03.849
- Yeah.

44:05.351 --> 44:08.937
- Did you make that startup
contribution like we said?

44:08.937 --> 44:10.648
(clears throat)
- Yeah.

44:10.648 --> 44:15.527
- Well, how could you afford
that, with the wedding?

44:15.527 --> 44:17.237
- It was just a couple of hundred bucks.

44:17.237 --> 44:18.739
- That's all you put in?

44:18.739 --> 44:20.866
- I know, I know, you said
make the full contribution

44:20.866 --> 44:23.410
but I know social security
is not gonna be there

44:23.410 --> 44:25.829
when I retire, and I can't
afford it right now, okay?

44:25.829 --> 44:26.955
The wedding is in two weeks.

44:26.955 --> 44:29.750
- Oh yeah, the wedding, you're
gonna go through with it.

44:29.750 --> 44:31.627
- What does that mean?

44:31.627 --> 44:32.461
- Nothing.

44:36.215 --> 44:37.216
- Oh my God,

44:39.677 --> 44:42.221
you've never been in love, have you?

44:42.221 --> 44:46.725
- Hey, I'm not talking love
with you, Davy, all right?

44:48.102 --> 44:50.145
What if you change your mind?

44:50.145 --> 44:51.438
- I'm not gonna change my mind.

44:51.438 --> 44:52.272
- You could.

44:52.272 --> 44:54.233
(scoffs)

44:54.233 --> 44:56.026
- I know the way you think.

44:56.026 --> 44:57.986
Isn't you who said if you
don't make any commitments

44:57.986 --> 44:59.863
then you can never be disappointed?

44:59.863 --> 45:00.698
- Uh-hum.

45:00.698 --> 45:03.283
- Yeah. Well, I'm gonna have someone

45:03.283 --> 45:06.412
to spend Saturday nights
with for the rest of my life.

45:06.412 --> 45:09.498
- Hey, I don't spend Saturday
nights alone, lover boy.

45:09.498 --> 45:11.750
(chuckles)

45:15.546 --> 45:17.297
- So, are you coming?

45:19.174 --> 45:21.468
(sighs)

45:21.468 --> 45:25.931
- I don't think I can make
it, weddings are not my thing.

45:25.931 --> 45:27.224
But I'll get you a gift.

45:27.224 --> 45:28.642
- You don't have to give me a gift.

45:28.642 --> 45:30.894
- No, I'll get you a gift.
- Just don't get... (sighs)

45:30.894 --> 45:32.646
Do you wanna see the ring?

45:32.646 --> 45:35.607
- The ring? You bought a ring?

45:35.607 --> 45:38.193
- Of course I bought a
ring, I'm not a savage.

45:38.193 --> 45:43.198
(jazz music playing in the background)

45:43.365 --> 45:45.868
- Wow, how much did that cost?

45:47.995 --> 45:48.829
- Why are you so interested

45:48.829 --> 45:51.582
in the way I spend my
money all of a sudden?

45:51.582 --> 45:56.587
- Money makes people make stupid
fucking decisions, is all.

45:56.628 --> 45:58.797
Like buying rings they can't afford.

45:58.797 --> 46:00.632
- I got a deal.

46:00.632 --> 46:03.552
- Yeah? It looks expensive.

46:03.552 --> 46:06.722
- Man, a two carat diamond
like this, costs upward of...

46:06.722 --> 46:08.557
- I know what rings like that cost.

46:08.557 --> 46:10.517
(Davy scoffs)

46:10.517 --> 46:13.020
You stole $20,000 out
of the evidence locker

46:13.020 --> 46:15.522
to buy a goddamn wedding ring.

46:18.525 --> 46:19.359
I knew it.

46:20.194 --> 46:21.028
I knew it.

46:23.197 --> 46:25.991
I so wanted you not to be a crook, Davy?

46:25.991 --> 46:28.535
What the fuck were you thinking?

46:28.535 --> 46:31.205
Buying a goddam faggot wedding ring.

46:31.205 --> 46:32.748
- That kind of language is reportable.

46:32.748 --> 46:34.500
- You think?

46:34.500 --> 46:37.920
- I think you need to take
that sensitivity class, Nate.

46:37.920 --> 46:40.422
- You know, they gave me the
job of showing you the ropes

46:40.422 --> 46:42.049
because they thought a hard ass like me

46:42.049 --> 46:45.093
could whip your little ass into giving up.

46:45.093 --> 46:47.721
But I'm a professional, I do my job,

46:47.721 --> 46:49.890
and I don't give a fuck if
you're wearing fishnet underwear.

46:49.890 --> 46:53.227
All I give a fuck is if
you do the job right,

46:53.227 --> 46:56.396
but I can't do anything about this.

46:56.396 --> 46:59.775
You're gonna go down for this, Davy.

46:59.775 --> 47:01.693
- I didn't take the money.

47:01.693 --> 47:04.196
- Well then, how did you
afford a ring like that?

47:04.196 --> 47:05.572
- It was $300.

47:05.572 --> 47:06.615
- A two carat diamond?

47:06.615 --> 47:08.242
- It's zirconium, all right?

47:08.242 --> 47:09.493
The guy told me no one but a jeweler

47:09.493 --> 47:14.081
would be able to tell the
difference, because it works.

47:18.126 --> 47:21.672
- Hey, I think that's the
guy we just got to call on.

47:21.672 --> 47:22.756
- What?

47:22.756 --> 47:27.761
- That Caucasian, 30 something,
red jacket, six foot.

47:27.970 --> 47:30.514
- No, he doesn't look
that tall, red jacket?

47:30.514 --> 47:32.307
- Red jacket.

47:32.307 --> 47:35.310
Step out, get behind him, we'll see.

47:36.186 --> 47:40.065
(indistinct chatter)

47:40.065 --> 47:42.818
(dramatic music)

47:50.659 --> 47:54.746
No, no, no, don't get too close, now Davy.

47:54.746 --> 47:57.499
(dramatic music)

48:26.403 --> 48:28.947
Gun, gun!
(fires)

48:28.947 --> 48:30.198
(body thuds)

48:30.198 --> 48:31.617
- [Kasha] Holy shit.

48:31.617 --> 48:34.995
- But I'm a professional, I do my job.

48:34.995 --> 48:37.623
And I don't give a fuck if
you're wearing fishnet underwear,

48:37.623 --> 48:40.292
all I give a fuck is if
you do the job right.

48:40.292 --> 48:42.753
But I can't do anything about this,

48:42.753 --> 48:45.881
you're gonna go down for this, Davy.

48:45.881 --> 48:48.800
- God, did he get into an accident?

48:50.093 --> 48:54.056
- It was a collision, his
head against the hood.

48:54.056 --> 48:58.644
- Only a jeweler would be
able to tell the difference.

48:58.644 --> 49:01.980
- But he's gonna fix it, I'm sure of it.

49:04.191 --> 49:06.318
- He doesn't look that tall, red jacket?

49:06.318 --> 49:08.111
- Red jacket.

49:08.111 --> 49:10.822
Step out, and get behind him.

49:10.822 --> 49:14.326
- Still drinking your orange juice?

49:14.326 --> 49:16.244
- I put a little vodka.

49:17.579 --> 49:21.041
You know your boyfriend was
really worried about you.

49:21.041 --> 49:23.919
- Ew, he is not my boyfriend.

49:23.919 --> 49:25.170
- She's my niece

49:25.170 --> 49:27.214
- [Kasha] And he can be a pain.

49:27.214 --> 49:31.009
- You are too much, very sexy, Kasha.

49:31.009 --> 49:33.261
Why don't you take a video?

49:36.098 --> 49:38.600
(speaking in foreign language)

49:38.600 --> 49:40.435
I want you to meet my beautiful

49:40.435 --> 49:41.269
(speaking in foreign language)

49:41.269 --> 49:43.897
- Hey, you back there.

49:43.897 --> 49:46.149
Get out of the way, thanks.

49:47.359 --> 49:49.653
- You know what, take it on my phone.

49:49.653 --> 49:50.612
- [Nate] Gun, gun!
(fires)

49:50.612 --> 49:53.281
(gasps)
- Jesus!

49:54.908 --> 49:56.994
- [Viktor] What the hell?

50:01.832 --> 50:06.294
- Oh shit, I thought
he was going for a gun.

50:06.294 --> 50:08.714
- A cell phone, but you were right,

50:08.714 --> 50:10.132
he was good for that domestic,

50:10.132 --> 50:11.925
he got a boatload of warrants too.

50:11.925 --> 50:13.135
- But no gun

50:13.135 --> 50:13.969
- No gun.

50:15.053 --> 50:16.680
- And next time you read
somebody their rights,

50:16.680 --> 50:18.849
could you man it up a little bit please?

50:18.849 --> 50:19.766
- Huh?

50:19.766 --> 50:22.310
- Oh, you have the right to remain silent,

50:22.310 --> 50:24.438
I mean, could you gay it
up more than that, huh?

50:24.438 --> 50:27.190
- You know, it's a good thing
I broke your glasses earlier,

50:27.190 --> 50:30.610
'cause if you could see there
might've been more damage.

50:30.610 --> 50:32.029
- Well, IAD's gonna come here

50:32.029 --> 50:33.405
and they're gonna try to
fuck me out of my pension,

50:33.405 --> 50:36.033
I'm telling you that right now.

50:36.033 --> 50:39.202
And you're still in deep Davy, right?

50:39.202 --> 50:41.288
You put these on.

50:41.288 --> 50:42.539
- Come on, Nate.

50:42.539 --> 50:46.168
Look I didn't steal
anything, I borrowed it.

50:47.085 --> 50:47.919
I promise you-

50:47.919 --> 50:48.754
- Put these on!

50:48.754 --> 50:49.588
- It'll be back in
there after the wedding.

50:49.588 --> 50:53.175
- Put them on, I'm tired
of taking shit for you.

50:53.175 --> 50:55.010
You're all snickering behind my back,

50:55.010 --> 50:57.304
they thought that I was like you,

50:57.304 --> 50:59.765
but I treated you right, didn't I?

50:59.765 --> 51:00.849
I did my job.

51:03.393 --> 51:04.644
What's gonna be my legacy now?

51:04.644 --> 51:08.648
A goddamn busted shooting
and a crooked partner.

51:10.901 --> 51:14.905
- Two weeks, I promise it
will be back in the box.

51:14.905 --> 51:16.406
My wedding gift is a
loan, it will cover it.

51:16.406 --> 51:19.409
- The grand jury date is tomorrow,

51:19.409 --> 51:21.244
it's gotta be back tomorrow.

51:21.244 --> 51:23.038
- Why the hell so soon?

51:23.038 --> 51:23.872
- I don't know,

51:23.872 --> 51:27.084
I don't question what
the DA's office is doing.

51:27.084 --> 51:28.794
But one thing I know for
sure, you're going to jail

51:28.794 --> 51:32.047
if it's not back there tomorrow morning.

51:32.047 --> 51:33.757
- I can apologize.

51:33.757 --> 51:37.552
- Apologize? What, are
you stupid? You idiot.

51:37.552 --> 51:42.432
You got $20,000 in small bills
you can put in there tonight?

51:42.432 --> 51:43.600
- No.

51:43.600 --> 51:47.979
- Bills with cocaine
sprinkled on them, huh?

51:47.979 --> 51:50.023
Because you know they can test for that.

51:50.023 --> 51:51.775
- [Dina] Officers?

51:51.775 --> 51:52.859
- What did you do with the money, Davy?

51:52.859 --> 51:56.530
What, you spent on that
faggot, gay wedding?

51:57.614 --> 51:58.448
- No.

51:59.407 --> 52:01.493
- Well, what then, the ring?

52:01.493 --> 52:03.620
- I told you, it's zirconium.

52:03.620 --> 52:07.249
- Then what? What did
you do with the $20,000?

52:07.249 --> 52:08.917
- It's supposed to be a surprise.

52:08.917 --> 52:09.835
- Surprise?

52:12.337 --> 52:14.089
- I bought you teeth.

52:15.715 --> 52:19.094
(calm music playing)

52:19.094 --> 52:20.095
- Me? Teeth?

52:22.681 --> 52:27.352
- Yeah, a retirement present,
and fucking expensive too.

52:29.104 --> 52:33.400
Implants, crowns, I just
wanted you to be able

52:33.400 --> 52:36.069
to fucking chew in your old age.

52:37.362 --> 52:39.614
- Officers.
- Officers.

52:39.614 --> 52:41.241
- What?
- What?

52:41.241 --> 52:43.451
- I do people favors.

52:43.451 --> 52:44.411
- What?

52:44.411 --> 52:48.790
- $20,000, in small bills,
with a taste of cocaine,

52:48.790 --> 52:50.250
it's not a big deal.

52:50.250 --> 52:52.502
- Yes, we do people favors.

52:53.837 --> 52:57.591
Did you need that tonight
or tomorrow morning?

52:57.591 --> 53:00.510
(enchanting music)

53:06.516 --> 53:08.310
- So years ago, I'm buying a car,

53:08.310 --> 53:09.895
and this old salesman comes out to me

53:09.895 --> 53:11.730
and I recognize him right off.

53:11.730 --> 53:14.441
'Cause he was famous from
doing commercials years before,

53:14.441 --> 53:17.152
you know with the shtick
and the bikini models,

53:17.152 --> 53:18.361
and the crocodile and the bear,

53:18.361 --> 53:20.572
you know him if you saw him.

53:20.572 --> 53:24.409
But I also remembered, that
he was convicted of fraud

53:24.409 --> 53:27.162
and went to jail, so
I knew he was a crook.

53:27.162 --> 53:29.372
But I still ended up buying
a car from him anyway

53:29.372 --> 53:32.292
because he convinced
me it was a great deal.

53:32.292 --> 53:35.629
Some people, can get away with anything.

53:37.505 --> 53:39.966
- Are you gonna show that to anyone?

53:39.966 --> 53:41.718
- Well, you always wanna
upload it to the cloud,

53:41.718 --> 53:45.555
but I have better things
I can put on YouTube.

53:47.057 --> 53:49.142
Can I have my phone back?

53:50.852 --> 53:51.686
Oh.

53:54.272 --> 53:56.816
(speaking in foreign language)

53:56.816 --> 53:59.444
- I want you to meet my
beautiful real estate agent.

53:59.444 --> 54:01.863
- [Kasha] Hey, you back there.

54:01.863 --> 54:03.990
Yeah, can you get out of the way, please?

54:03.990 --> 54:04.824
Thanks.

54:06.201 --> 54:07.702
- You know what, why don't
you take it on my phone?

54:07.702 --> 54:09.829
- [Nate] Gun, gun, gun!

54:09.829 --> 54:10.872
(gunshot)

54:10.872 --> 54:12.874
(thuds)

54:14.167 --> 54:15.502
- What the hell?

54:18.296 --> 54:20.423
- You okay, partner?

54:20.423 --> 54:21.424
- Holy shit.

54:22.801 --> 54:23.635
Hey.

54:29.307 --> 54:32.978
(enchanting guitar playing)

54:51.246 --> 54:53.581
- My mother once asked when
I was gonna get married,

54:53.581 --> 54:55.834
and I said, "When I
meet the perfect girl."

54:55.834 --> 54:58.295
She said, "Well, I guess
you're never gonna get married,

54:58.295 --> 55:00.880
'cause the perfect girl is
looking for the perfect guy."

55:00.880 --> 55:02.173
Thanks mom.

55:02.173 --> 55:05.343
(phone rings)

55:05.343 --> 55:06.261
- Bergen's.

55:07.345 --> 55:08.596
Yeah, but we got a lot of assholes here,

55:08.596 --> 55:10.932
this one got a name?

55:10.932 --> 55:12.350
Yeah, he is here.

55:13.560 --> 55:15.353
One thing, is that life is about choices.

55:15.353 --> 55:17.063
Now, some choices don't make
a big difference at all,

55:17.063 --> 55:18.898
Coke, Pepsi, but other choices,

55:18.898 --> 55:20.942
you gotta live with your entire life.

55:20.942 --> 55:24.863
But you still have to make the
choice or you have no life.

55:24.863 --> 55:27.824
It's just making the right
choice, that's so damn hard.

55:27.824 --> 55:29.159
Phone, good sir.

55:31.453 --> 55:32.996
Enjoy.

55:32.996 --> 55:34.122
- Hello?

55:34.122 --> 55:36.791
- I am a man who believes in karma.

55:36.791 --> 55:40.337
You do me nice, I'll do the same for you,

55:40.337 --> 55:42.422
but if you do me wrong...

55:42.422 --> 55:44.883
- Viktor, I didn't know she
was your girlfriend, man.

55:44.883 --> 55:48.261
- Kasha? She is not girlfriend,

55:48.261 --> 55:50.680
she's my niece, she's family.

55:51.973 --> 55:55.060
And I like my niece, you not so much.

55:57.771 --> 56:00.523
- You're holding me up for
money for hitting on your niece?

56:00.523 --> 56:04.778
- Holding you up? You think
I'm that kind of a person?

56:04.778 --> 56:08.156
The money is not for
me, it's for my friend,

56:08.156 --> 56:10.617
the real estate agent, Didi.

56:10.617 --> 56:14.913
You treated her badly
and you damaged her car.

56:14.913 --> 56:16.956
- But you pounded my head into her hood.

56:16.956 --> 56:20.335
- But you were responsible,
it was your car,

56:20.335 --> 56:22.003
you have to pay.

56:22.003 --> 56:25.173
Please, put the money in
a paper bag, not plastic,

56:25.173 --> 56:26.966
it's best for animals.

56:26.966 --> 56:28.802
I will be coming soon.

56:29.677 --> 56:32.931
Don't disappoint me, do you understand?

57:23.314 --> 57:24.149
Thanks.

57:30.196 --> 57:31.030
(phone rings)

57:31.030 --> 57:33.491
- I have it, I have your money.

- What money? Is this all about money?

57:36.703 --> 57:37.537
(sighs)

57:37.537 --> 57:38.371
- Hi, mom.

57:38.371 --> 57:39.330
- If it's money you need,

57:39.330 --> 57:41.541
now, you know your father
and I, we can help out.

57:41.541 --> 57:45.545
- It's not money. Like I
said, I'm just not ready.

57:45.545 --> 57:48.631
- You can't just tell her
you will, and then you won't.

57:48.631 --> 57:52.010
I didn't bring up that kind of person.

57:52.010 --> 57:54.137
- Maybe it's something psychological.

57:54.137 --> 57:56.014
- I'm not crazy, dad.

57:56.014 --> 57:58.433
- Is there a problem in the bedroom?

57:58.433 --> 58:00.351
- I'm not talking about
my sex life with you.

58:00.351 --> 58:02.770
- Okay then, talk to your father.

58:02.770 --> 58:04.731
- Men can have trouble
with erections, Milo,

58:04.731 --> 58:06.107
at any time of their life.

58:06.107 --> 58:08.193
- Dad, I can get...

58:08.193 --> 58:09.903
I can get an erection.

58:09.903 --> 58:12.113
- Well then, if you can
get an erection, Milo,

58:12.113 --> 58:13.698
what's the problem, baby, huh?

58:13.698 --> 58:16.534
- Mom, it's not about sex. The sex is...

58:16.534 --> 58:17.994
- Where are you, Milo?

58:17.994 --> 58:21.289
- I'm at Bergen's, having a
drink, working on business.

58:21.289 --> 58:24.250
- This is something we need
to talk about, face to face.

58:24.250 --> 58:25.460
- I don't wanna talk about it.

58:25.460 --> 58:28.463
- Stay there, we're on our way.

58:28.463 --> 58:29.464
(sighs)

58:29.464 --> 58:33.051
- Thank you, Jesus, he
can get an erection.

58:35.678 --> 58:36.513
- Fuck.

58:40.183 --> 58:42.018
- Do you mind company?

58:43.186 --> 58:44.854
- I think I'll pass.

58:44.854 --> 58:49.192
I'm expecting people,
including your friend, Viktor.

58:51.402 --> 58:52.987
- He can overreact.

58:56.991 --> 58:57.825
- Okay.

58:58.952 --> 59:00.370
- It's okay, sit.

59:04.207 --> 59:07.043
- You look like you needed a beer.

59:08.503 --> 59:10.672
(sighs contentedly)

59:10.672 --> 59:12.006
No, no, no, it's okay.

59:12.006 --> 59:13.049
- You were counting pennies, take it.

59:13.049 --> 59:16.386
- No, I don't need your
money. It was an experiment.

59:16.386 --> 59:19.180
- What kind of experiment?

59:19.180 --> 59:22.183
- Well, men have been taking
care of me my whole life,

59:22.183 --> 59:26.354
I just wanted to see if I
could make it on my own.

59:27.438 --> 59:28.273
Thank you.

59:29.732 --> 59:30.567
Yes.

59:35.613 --> 59:38.199
You get hungry standing on corners.

59:38.199 --> 59:41.369
- So how much can you
make, standing on corners?

59:41.369 --> 59:43.955
- Some people make thousands begging,

59:43.955 --> 59:46.624
lots more than working a nine to five.

59:46.624 --> 59:47.709
- [Milo] Standing on corners.

59:47.709 --> 59:49.961
- Yeah, you just gotta
figure out the right tack,

59:49.961 --> 59:51.713
and the right corner.

59:52.880 --> 59:55.091
- It's not gonna be good for a baby.

59:55.091 --> 59:56.175
- Whose baby?

59:58.761 --> 1:00:01.139
Oh,
(chuckles)

1:00:01.139 --> 1:00:03.349
Do I look like that
much of a loser to you?

1:00:03.349 --> 1:00:07.437
I'm not homeless or pregnant,
that's just my signage.

1:00:07.437 --> 1:00:08.688
Homeless gets you coin,

1:00:08.688 --> 1:00:11.858
homeless and pregnant gets you paper.

1:00:11.858 --> 1:00:13.693
- So, you're scamming people.

1:00:13.693 --> 1:00:17.530
- Oh, what? Like you
never break the rules?

1:00:17.530 --> 1:00:21.200
- And panhandling, that's your plan

1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:23.286
- Until I catch my break.

1:00:24.579 --> 1:00:28.499
I'm a singer, and a
songwriter, and an actress.

1:00:29.709 --> 1:00:31.544
- It's tough business.

1:00:31.544 --> 1:00:34.714
You gotta be at the right
place, the right time,

1:00:34.714 --> 1:00:37.383
you gotta have talent.

1:00:37.383 --> 1:00:39.969
- What makes you think I don't?

1:00:39.969 --> 1:00:42.889
- I don't mean to say you're not talented,

1:00:42.889 --> 1:00:45.391
you're probably very talented.

1:00:46.601 --> 1:00:48.853
You've got the look.

1:00:48.853 --> 1:00:49.687
- Uh-hum.

1:00:51.147 --> 1:00:54.067
And what is it you like looking at?

1:00:55.777 --> 1:00:57.195
- I'm not going there.

1:00:57.195 --> 1:00:58.363
- Going where?

1:01:00.073 --> 1:01:02.492
(phone buzzes)

1:01:02.492 --> 1:01:05.036
(sighs)

1:01:05.036 --> 1:01:05.870
They're on their way.

1:01:05.870 --> 1:01:06.704
- Who?

1:01:08.414 --> 1:01:09.832
- My mom and dad.

1:01:14.962 --> 1:01:18.174
Yeah, I'm always talking to
them in uppercase letters,

1:01:18.174 --> 1:01:22.220
everything is loud, I have to tone down.

1:01:22.220 --> 1:01:25.598
- What message were you
trying to get across?

1:01:25.598 --> 1:01:26.766
- I'm engaged.

1:01:29.018 --> 1:01:31.479
The wedding is in two weeks.

1:01:31.479 --> 1:01:32.980
- Congratulations.

1:01:34.565 --> 1:01:38.403
- Don't congratulate
me, I'm breaking it off.

1:01:38.403 --> 1:01:41.614
And my parents are not happy about it.

1:01:41.614 --> 1:01:42.448
- Sorry.

1:01:43.658 --> 1:01:46.744
- Don't be, it's the right thing to do.

1:01:46.744 --> 1:01:48.079
- What happened?

1:01:49.914 --> 1:01:50.748
(sighs)

1:01:50.748 --> 1:01:55.461
- Nothing happened, I just
don't think she's one.

1:01:55.461 --> 1:01:57.964
- How long have you been going together?

1:01:57.964 --> 1:01:58.881
- 10 years.

1:02:00.591 --> 1:02:03.886
- What? It took you 10 years to figure out

1:02:03.886 --> 1:02:05.888
she's not the one.

1:02:05.888 --> 1:02:07.598
- Is this is a rehearsal
for what my mother will say?

1:02:07.598 --> 1:02:08.766
- No, no, but,

1:02:10.351 --> 1:02:13.813
you're probably gonna fuck this girl up.

1:02:13.813 --> 1:02:14.647
- She'll bounce back.

1:02:14.647 --> 1:02:17.483
(sneering)

1:02:17.483 --> 1:02:20.027
- How did you let it get that far?

1:02:20.027 --> 1:02:23.364
- She was always the girlfriend, steady,

1:02:24.907 --> 1:02:27.118
the one I took to the prom.

1:02:27.118 --> 1:02:28.911
(enchanting music playing)

1:02:28.911 --> 1:02:32.331
I still remember, she wore this backless,

1:02:32.331 --> 1:02:34.167
strapless, blue thing.

1:02:37.795 --> 1:02:40.381
After high school we
both went separate ways,

1:02:40.381 --> 1:02:43.384
different colleges, different towns.

1:02:45.595 --> 1:02:47.805
Years ago, we made a vow that
if neither of us were married

1:02:47.805 --> 1:02:51.267
by the time we were 30,
we would marry each other.

1:02:51.267 --> 1:02:53.060
(chuckles)

1:02:53.060 --> 1:02:54.395
That was stupid.

1:02:56.481 --> 1:03:00.026
But every now and then we bring it up,

1:03:00.026 --> 1:03:01.861
just joking, you know?

1:03:03.863 --> 1:03:08.785
Last month she turned 30, and
when she brought it up again,

1:03:11.204 --> 1:03:12.914
(moaning)
- You wanna get married?

1:03:12.914 --> 1:03:15.958
- Yeah.
(moaning)

1:03:15.958 --> 1:03:16.876
- Romantic.

1:03:20.087 --> 1:03:21.214
- You know when you meet a girl,

1:03:21.214 --> 1:03:22.507
and you bring her home to mom and dad,

1:03:22.507 --> 1:03:25.134
you want them to like her.

1:03:25.134 --> 1:03:27.345
My parents, they love Evie.

1:03:30.431 --> 1:03:34.268
They say when you meet
the right one you know,

1:03:35.186 --> 1:03:38.856
I don't know, so I'm
thinking it's not love.

1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:43.611
- Maybe you just like to fuck around.

1:03:43.611 --> 1:03:45.571
There's nothing wrong
with that, just admit it.

1:03:45.571 --> 1:03:48.658
- No, it's not... I mean, yes, but...

1:03:49.826 --> 1:03:51.619
I just think it is time to settle down.

1:03:51.619 --> 1:03:55.748
- Oh, who's that talking now? Your mother?

1:03:55.748 --> 1:03:58.501
- What if Evie is the right one?

1:03:58.501 --> 1:04:01.087
And I'm just too dense to figure it out.

1:04:01.087 --> 1:04:02.338
- Mh-hm.
- I don't know.

1:04:02.338 --> 1:04:04.882
- Bullshit, you know.

1:04:04.882 --> 1:04:08.636
There has gotta be something
that turns you off,

1:04:08.636 --> 1:04:09.554
what is it?

1:04:11.889 --> 1:04:15.685
- You know, I don't really know you,

1:04:15.685 --> 1:04:19.438
I really don't wanna
talk about this anymore.

1:04:25.820 --> 1:04:26.654
- Like it?

1:04:28.030 --> 1:04:29.407
- Beautiful.

1:04:29.407 --> 1:04:31.909
- Thanks, I love nice jewelry.

1:04:33.077 --> 1:04:34.829
It's expensive, I could live for a year

1:04:34.829 --> 1:04:36.664
off of what this cost.

1:04:38.207 --> 1:04:39.709
- A gift from a boyfriend.

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:41.127
- No, I stole it,

1:04:42.461 --> 1:04:45.047
from my aunt.
(chuckles)

1:04:45.047 --> 1:04:46.173
She never missed it.

1:04:46.173 --> 1:04:47.466
You know, some people have too much money

1:04:47.466 --> 1:04:49.218
and too much jewelry.

1:04:53.556 --> 1:04:55.725
I was raped when I was 16.

1:05:00.605 --> 1:05:01.606
- I'm sorry.

1:05:03.858 --> 1:05:05.067
I don't know what to say.

1:05:05.067 --> 1:05:09.363
- You don't have say
anything, I'm over it.

1:05:09.363 --> 1:05:10.489
Well, I'm not over it,

1:05:10.489 --> 1:05:14.076
but at least I didn't
turn gay or celibate.

1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:19.957
So what is it that you
don't wanna talk about?

1:05:25.588 --> 1:05:27.256
Come on, talk to me.

1:05:29.550 --> 1:05:33.638
It'll be good to get what's inside, out.

1:05:33.638 --> 1:05:34.722
- Okay.

1:05:34.722 --> 1:05:35.556
- Yeah.

1:05:39.644 --> 1:05:43.230
- What bothers me about
Evie, she's freaky.

1:05:46.442 --> 1:05:48.569
- Oh, kinky sex?

1:05:48.569 --> 1:05:51.739
- No, I'm not talking about this with you.

1:05:51.739 --> 1:05:53.783
- Oh, I touched a nerve there, did I?

1:05:53.783 --> 1:05:56.869
- No, the sex is okay. It's not that.

1:05:58.621 --> 1:06:00.122
- Then what is it?

1:06:02.917 --> 1:06:05.294
- She doesn't like to kiss.

1:06:05.294 --> 1:06:06.587
- That's it?

1:06:06.587 --> 1:06:10.007
- And her mouth doesn't go anywhere else.

1:06:11.717 --> 1:06:14.053
- Oh, so you're gonna tell your parents

1:06:14.053 --> 1:06:15.346
that you're breaking off an engagement

1:06:15.346 --> 1:06:17.056
because she won't go down on you.

1:06:17.056 --> 1:06:18.057
(chuckles)

1:06:18.057 --> 1:06:21.435
- No, that's not what I'm gonna say.

1:06:21.435 --> 1:06:24.355
And that's not it, it's other stuff too.

1:06:24.355 --> 1:06:26.107
- Like what?

1:06:26.107 --> 1:06:30.111
- I've written poetry,
like raps to other girls,

1:06:32.196 --> 1:06:33.864
I've never written her one.

1:06:33.864 --> 1:06:35.449
- So write one.

1:06:35.449 --> 1:06:37.326
- I'm not inspired.

1:06:37.326 --> 1:06:41.580
- Okay. So if you can't
say it, rap it, or kiss it,

1:06:45.251 --> 1:06:47.294
maybe it isn't love.

1:06:47.294 --> 1:06:51.966
But what are you gonna tell
her after 10 years of waiting?

1:06:51.966 --> 1:06:52.800
- You're not helping.

1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:54.635
- I'm just being real.

1:06:56.095 --> 1:06:58.389
Now, if we could get her to hate you

1:06:58.389 --> 1:06:59.849
for something other than ruining

1:06:59.849 --> 1:07:02.685
the happiest moment of her life...

1:07:05.146 --> 1:07:07.815
(phone buzzing)

1:07:09.108 --> 1:07:10.693
Is that them?

1:07:10.693 --> 1:07:12.945
- Yep, they're parking now.

1:07:14.488 --> 1:07:16.490
Shit, Evie's coming too.

1:07:18.534 --> 1:07:23.539
- Oh okay, um, let me clean
this place up a bit for you.

1:07:23.789 --> 1:07:25.374
- No, don't bother.

1:07:29.712 --> 1:07:30.713
- Good luck.

1:07:33.674 --> 1:07:37.928
(enchanting guitar playing)

1:07:37.928 --> 1:07:38.929
- I didn't want it to be like this,

1:07:38.929 --> 1:07:40.806
I just... One step at a time!

1:07:40.806 --> 1:07:42.308
- She has a dress, I have a dress,

1:07:42.308 --> 1:07:44.518
we have people coming from out of state.

1:07:44.518 --> 1:07:46.145
- When were you going to tell me?

1:07:46.145 --> 1:07:49.982
- I understand marriage
responsibility, it's scary.

1:07:49.982 --> 1:07:52.318
- People have plane
tickets, non-refundable.

1:07:52.318 --> 1:07:53.527
- If it's something I did.

1:07:53.527 --> 1:07:55.154
- No, nothing like that.

1:07:55.154 --> 1:07:57.448
- I didn't do anything
wrong other than love you.

1:07:57.448 --> 1:07:59.575
- It's me, not you. I'm just not sure.

1:07:59.575 --> 1:08:00.659
- You've got dozens of girls

1:08:00.659 --> 1:08:02.578
and you always come back to Evie.

1:08:02.578 --> 1:08:05.498
- Just tell me, what is it, really?

1:08:06.791 --> 1:08:08.334
- I can't write you poetry.

1:08:08.334 --> 1:08:11.003
- Are you nuts? They
have homework for that.

1:08:11.003 --> 1:08:13.964
- Okay, so you're not a poet,
but we're good for each other.

1:08:13.964 --> 1:08:16.008
- I just think we're rushing into this,

1:08:16.008 --> 1:08:17.134
I think we should wait.

1:08:17.134 --> 1:08:20.095
- It took you three weeks
to pick out napkin rings,

1:08:20.095 --> 1:08:22.223
and you think we're rushing?

1:08:22.223 --> 1:08:25.768
- I thought we could take
a trip to Vegas or Hawaii,

1:08:25.768 --> 1:08:26.852
sort it all out.

1:08:26.852 --> 1:08:30.064
- You think you can dis-invite 200 people

1:08:30.064 --> 1:08:32.398
and Evie's gonna wait?

1:08:32.398 --> 1:08:35.736
- I wanna be with you, but I can't wait.

1:08:38.823 --> 1:08:41.908
- Please, don't make it now or never.

1:08:43.994 --> 1:08:47.372
- You think you have a lot
of time for choices, Milo,

1:08:47.372 --> 1:08:51.252
sometimes you only have a
moment to make the right one.

1:08:51.252 --> 1:08:54.337
- We were teenagers at prom,

1:08:54.337 --> 1:08:58.217
and it was a night, a
first for the both of us.

1:08:58.217 --> 1:09:02.971
And we were both nervous and
awkward, but then we kissed,

1:09:06.142 --> 1:09:09.310
and it was more than just a kiss.

1:09:09.310 --> 1:09:12.481
You felt it then, and you know it now.

1:09:15.651 --> 1:09:17.653
Milo, it's now or never.

1:09:19.572 --> 1:09:21.407
Do you love me or not?

1:09:33.335 --> 1:09:34.253
- Yes, yes.

1:09:49.559 --> 1:09:52.146
♪ Get me a girl in skintight jeans ♪

1:09:52.146 --> 1:09:55.816
♪ Complicated, kind of mean ♪

1:09:57.735 --> 1:09:58.903
- Hello, Milo.

1:10:00.654 --> 1:10:05.659
♪ She's crazy, oh, oh, so deranged ♪

1:10:06.410 --> 1:10:10.581
♪ Crazy, just this side of insane ♪

1:10:12.708 --> 1:10:16.879
I'm Courtney. Milo, has
told me so much about you.

1:10:17.838 --> 1:10:19.924
(scoffs)

1:10:22.968 --> 1:10:25.387
There you go, problem solved.

1:10:25.387 --> 1:10:28.724
- Evie, I can explain, she's an actress.

1:10:31.977 --> 1:10:35.397
- Now, there is a mischief maker for you.

1:10:38.484 --> 1:10:40.193
(chuckles)

1:10:40.193 --> 1:10:42.529
Don't forget your doggy bag.

1:10:52.081 --> 1:10:54.458
We all want a devil for under the sheets.

1:10:54.458 --> 1:10:56.377
Saints? For dashboards.

1:10:57.670 --> 1:11:00.089
Is it because life is basically so boring

1:11:00.089 --> 1:11:02.716
that we need people
like her to spice it up?

1:11:02.716 --> 1:11:04.718
'Cause I know you can
find joy in doing things

1:11:04.718 --> 1:11:05.803
you're not supposed to do,

1:11:05.803 --> 1:11:09.056
but sometimes there's the devil to pay.

1:11:12.226 --> 1:11:15.312
(calm music playing)

1:11:30.452 --> 1:11:32.454
- All right, let's lock it up.

1:11:32.454 --> 1:11:33.789
- Will do, boss.

1:11:36.750 --> 1:11:39.169
(door shuts)

1:11:51.849 --> 1:11:52.683
What?

1:11:54.559 --> 1:11:55.894
Go ahead, judge.

1:11:58.522 --> 1:12:02.443
You can love me, you can
hate me, I don't care.

1:12:03.693 --> 1:12:05.612
I just wanna feel good.

1:12:08.699 --> 1:12:13.370
For just a few minutes, feel
good about myself, my life.

1:12:15.289 --> 1:12:19.626
'cause it's easy to feel
good if you've got money,

1:12:19.626 --> 1:12:23.547
love, sex, family, I haven't
got any of those things.

1:12:23.547 --> 1:12:24.548
All I got...

1:12:28.469 --> 1:12:29.928
And I bet looking down on me

1:12:29.928 --> 1:12:33.474
makes you feel pretty good
about yourself, doesn't it?

1:12:33.474 --> 1:12:34.850
Because no matter how bad it gets for you

1:12:34.850 --> 1:12:38.145
you can always say, at
least I'm not that guy,

1:12:38.145 --> 1:12:40.397
at least I'm not a druggie.

1:12:44.276 --> 1:12:45.693
The way I see it,

1:12:46.987 --> 1:12:49.239
I'm doing a public service.

1:12:55.871 --> 1:12:58.540
(siren wailing)

1:13:02.335 --> 1:13:04.380
- [Man On Radio] Go ahead.

1:13:04.380 --> 1:13:06.799
(door opens)

1:13:08.175 --> 1:13:09.468
- [Paramedic] How long has he been down?

1:13:09.468 --> 1:13:11.553
- I'm not sure, I came back
because I forgot something

1:13:11.553 --> 1:13:12.971
and I found him right there.

1:13:12.971 --> 1:13:13.806
- [Paramedic] Is he breathing?

1:13:13.806 --> 1:13:15.724
- [Murray] I don't know

1:13:22.523 --> 1:13:24.400
- Hey, what's going on?

1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:27.152
(dramatic music)

1:13:29.071 --> 1:13:30.239
What happened?

1:13:31.698 --> 1:13:32.950
- [Nana] Jacob?

1:13:34.660 --> 1:13:35.494
- Hello?

1:13:39.039 --> 1:13:41.541
I'm sorry ma'am, we're closed.

1:13:46.839 --> 1:13:48.507
- Hello, sweetheart.

1:14:00.352 --> 1:14:02.646
Don't be scared, Jacob. Sit.

1:14:08.861 --> 1:14:11.362
- You look just like my nana.

1:14:11.362 --> 1:14:12.990
- Yeah.

1:14:12.990 --> 1:14:15.242
- I'm sorry, this is weird.

1:14:16.452 --> 1:14:17.577
I'm stoned

1:14:17.577 --> 1:14:20.414
- No, it's all right. I am your nana.

1:14:20.414 --> 1:14:21.540
- [Speed] You're not my nana.

1:14:21.540 --> 1:14:24.626
- Not your Nana? Who else would I be?

1:14:25.585 --> 1:14:27.880
- We buried her, I was at her funeral.

1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:32.718
- Yeah, I know. And everybody
had such nice things to say,

1:14:34.594 --> 1:14:38.764
even your cousin, Joey, he never
had a nice word for anybody

1:14:38.764 --> 1:14:40.434
- Lady, who are you?

1:14:43.061 --> 1:14:44.353
- I'm your nana.

1:14:47.065 --> 1:14:49.568
- Oh my God, Nana.
(chuckling)

1:14:49.568 --> 1:14:52.404
Who did we bury? I'll go tell mom.

1:14:53.780 --> 1:14:58.076
- I'm the nana, whose chocolate
chipped cookies you loved,

1:14:58.076 --> 1:15:00.996
the soft gluey ones, huh?

1:15:00.996 --> 1:15:04.500
Who bought you your graduation suit?

1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:09.004
Or worried about that big,
red birthmark on your tush.

1:15:11.340 --> 1:15:13.800
- I gotta go call mom.

1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:16.803
- All right, Jacob, I'm not
gonna beat around the bush.

1:15:16.803 --> 1:15:17.638
(Speed stammering)

1:15:17.638 --> 1:15:19.306
- [Speed] Look, I'll call her.

1:15:19.306 --> 1:15:20.139
- Jacob?

1:15:21.058 --> 1:15:23.809
(dramatic music)

1:15:25.853 --> 1:15:28.106
Who the hell are you?

1:15:28.106 --> 1:15:31.860
- Hell? No, that's not
me, I'm not from hell.

1:15:34.071 --> 1:15:35.489
There is no hell.

1:15:37.241 --> 1:15:40.994
But like I said, I'll
get right to the point,

1:15:42.496 --> 1:15:44.581
without being mysterious.

1:15:51.046 --> 1:15:52.047
You're dead.

1:15:53.173 --> 1:15:54.675
- What?

1:15:54.675 --> 1:15:57.219
- Right now you'll
probably think you're high,

1:15:57.219 --> 1:15:58.554
but you're dead.

1:16:00.180 --> 1:16:01.181
They'll be bringing your body

1:16:01.181 --> 1:16:04.309
out of the restroom momentarily.

1:16:04.309 --> 1:16:07.353
- Ugh, what a day this has been.

1:16:07.353 --> 1:16:11.817
An hour ago, this lady
on a train in St. Louis,

1:16:11.817 --> 1:16:13.318
she drops dead,

1:16:13.318 --> 1:16:15.821
I was in such a rush I
didn't have time to eat.

1:16:15.821 --> 1:16:20.576
She was young, 50, but she
had family history, you know

1:16:20.576 --> 1:16:22.661
high blood pressure, diabetes,

1:16:22.661 --> 1:16:25.205
she has a time bomb, she just went off.

1:16:25.205 --> 1:16:27.958
So I had to get to her first, but you,

1:16:27.958 --> 1:16:30.919
we had a whole team on
standby waiting for you,

1:16:30.919 --> 1:16:34.339
for a long, long time, you were expected.

1:16:36.383 --> 1:16:37.800
I don't know, Jacob,

1:16:37.800 --> 1:16:40.637
a lot of people went way
out of their way for you.

1:16:40.637 --> 1:16:42.973
They gave love, money, time,

1:16:45.559 --> 1:16:49.396
we all thought you're
gonna clean up your act.

1:16:52.773 --> 1:16:55.277
- No, no, no, no, this is fucked.

1:16:55.277 --> 1:16:59.072
- Jacob, where'd you learn such language?

1:16:59.072 --> 1:17:03.744
You don't talk like that
to your nana, to anybody.

1:17:03.744 --> 1:17:04.745
- Fuck.

1:17:04.745 --> 1:17:06.788
- Your nana's right,
the word is offensive.

1:17:06.788 --> 1:17:10.250
So let's begin again,
and you needn't worry,

1:17:10.250 --> 1:17:14.212
I'm not that grim reaper
they show in the movies,

1:17:14.212 --> 1:17:16.048
what a joke.

1:17:16.048 --> 1:17:17.466
- This is a joke.

1:17:21.511 --> 1:17:24.014
- I don't joke, I'm not funny.

1:17:27.142 --> 1:17:29.394
It's only that I've found over the years,

1:17:29.394 --> 1:17:33.940
that it's best to first
put my subjects at ease.

1:17:33.940 --> 1:17:34.858
- Subjects?

1:17:35.776 --> 1:17:36.818
- Of all your family,

1:17:36.818 --> 1:17:41.239
you've always felt most
comfortable with your nana,

1:17:41.239 --> 1:17:44.493
a so lovely woman, good heart,

1:17:44.493 --> 1:17:46.827
dreadful taste in perfume.

1:17:46.827 --> 1:17:50.040
- I just wanna know what's
going on here, okay?

1:17:50.040 --> 1:17:51.833
- Go see for yourself.

1:17:59.049 --> 1:18:00.967
(suspenseful music)

1:18:00.967 --> 1:18:03.553
- [Paramedics] One, two, three.

1:18:05.263 --> 1:18:08.517
(somber music playing)

1:18:19.027 --> 1:18:21.947
(door creaks open)

1:18:36.460 --> 1:18:37.295
- Nana?

1:18:48.974 --> 1:18:50.225
- Such a shame.

1:18:55.856 --> 1:18:58.692
You want a sprinkled fried chicken?

1:18:58.692 --> 1:19:00.943
They put a little honey in the butter,

1:19:00.943 --> 1:19:03.196
like the kind I used to make.

1:19:03.196 --> 1:19:05.615
(indistinct)

1:19:10.871 --> 1:19:13.457
- All they had open was espino,

1:19:14.833 --> 1:19:17.252
it's not my favorite.

1:19:17.252 --> 1:19:20.297
- I was just trying to get a little high.

1:19:20.297 --> 1:19:21.298
Oh, come on.

1:19:25.802 --> 1:19:29.681
- Jacob, I know it's all very disturbing,

1:19:29.681 --> 1:19:31.850
but what can you do?

1:19:31.850 --> 1:19:35.228
We thought you'd grow out of it,

1:19:35.228 --> 1:19:40.108
we thought you'd grow up
be a mitch, but you didn't.

1:19:40.108 --> 1:19:43.528
And you know what you left behind? Guilt.

1:19:46.114 --> 1:19:47.907
Everybody who loved you

1:19:47.907 --> 1:19:51.452
they're now wondering if
they could have done more.

1:19:51.452 --> 1:19:53.830
What could we have done?

1:19:53.830 --> 1:19:55.707
You aren't our little guy anymore,

1:19:55.707 --> 1:19:58.960
where we could tell you not
to put things in your mouth.

1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:02.880
And I heard you say you
had no love, no family,

1:20:04.049 --> 1:20:07.302
you had both, you just slapped us away.

1:20:12.808 --> 1:20:14.309
- I'm sorry, nana.

1:20:18.271 --> 1:20:19.689
I didn't mean it.

1:20:23.735 --> 1:20:25.320
I can change.

1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:27.239
(scoffs)

1:20:27.239 --> 1:20:31.034
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
I want my nana, not you.

1:20:31.034 --> 1:20:34.538
- You can't always have what you want.

1:20:34.538 --> 1:20:38.959
You get one life, Jacob,
like most you squandered it.

1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:44.380
Most deaths are by suicide you know,

1:20:44.380 --> 1:20:46.508
we don't believe it but it's true.

1:20:46.508 --> 1:20:50.219
Quick with a gun, a bit
slower with a needle,

1:20:51.721 --> 1:20:54.766
and sometimes they take years.

1:20:54.766 --> 1:20:57.519
It's suicide by too much,

1:20:57.519 --> 1:21:01.064
too much smoking, too much drinking.

1:21:01.064 --> 1:21:03.817
We all know that death
is inevitable but...

1:21:03.817 --> 1:21:05.986
I had this young fellow last week,

1:21:05.986 --> 1:21:10.740
he went on and on about
how he was a vegetarian,

1:21:10.740 --> 1:21:14.244
like broccoli has the key to immortality,

1:21:14.244 --> 1:21:15.829
a really cocky guy.

1:21:18.248 --> 1:21:20.500
- So there's no going back.

1:21:23.753 --> 1:21:28.717
- Jacob, you always had a
good head on your shoulders,

1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:30.760
but not any smart.

1:21:30.760 --> 1:21:34.514
You understand what's going on
here, with this is all about?

1:21:34.514 --> 1:21:37.183
Of course there's no going back.

1:21:39.184 --> 1:21:41.271
I hate it when they ask that,

1:21:41.271 --> 1:21:45.442
that vegetarian just wouldn't come along.

1:21:45.442 --> 1:21:47.986
- Did he have a choice?

1:21:47.986 --> 1:21:48.820
No, no, no, no,

1:21:48.820 --> 1:21:51.489
I don't wanna talk to that
other woman please, just you.

1:21:51.489 --> 1:21:56.327
- Jacob, even your nana likes
to put on a little lipstick.

1:21:58.538 --> 1:22:02.834
- So I have a choice, I don't have to die.

1:22:02.834 --> 1:22:05.253
- You like this color?

1:22:05.253 --> 1:22:09.049
(speaking in foreign language)

1:22:09.049 --> 1:22:11.718
Of course you'll have to die,

1:22:11.718 --> 1:22:13.386
everyone has to die.

1:22:14.304 --> 1:22:15.847
- But that guy, the vegetarian,

1:22:15.847 --> 1:22:16.889
you said he wouldn't come along.

1:22:16.889 --> 1:22:19.601
So what'd you do? Did you drag him out?

1:22:19.601 --> 1:22:21.102
Take him to heaven, hell?

1:22:21.102 --> 1:22:25.190
- I told you, there is no
hell, no heaven either.

1:22:26.066 --> 1:22:27.651
- So what is there?

1:22:29.152 --> 1:22:32.237
- Well, there's always fried chicken.

1:22:35.825 --> 1:22:39.287
You people, you always
lose your sense of humor

1:22:39.287 --> 1:22:40.956
in times like these.

1:22:42.707 --> 1:22:43.541
Let's go.

1:22:47.003 --> 1:22:49.089
- I'm not going anywhere.

1:22:51.466 --> 1:22:52.592
(exclaiming excitedly)

1:22:52.592 --> 1:22:53.843
Maybe I'm okay.

1:22:56.304 --> 1:22:57.889
- Nope.

1:22:57.889 --> 1:22:59.391
- How do you know?

1:23:01.393 --> 1:23:04.145
- Who figures he'd die in my bar.

1:23:05.146 --> 1:23:06.439
- You coming?

1:23:06.439 --> 1:23:09.025
(upbeat music)

1:23:10.735 --> 1:23:13.279
- Jacob, do you remember I told you

1:23:13.279 --> 1:23:15.448
I used to be off a hoofer.

1:23:17.575 --> 1:23:21.996
I did Broadway once when I
was 19, "West Side Story",

1:23:23.540 --> 1:23:26.418
"The Chorus", (indistinct)

1:23:26.418 --> 1:23:28.335
Oh, that was something.

1:23:30.130 --> 1:23:32.298
But then I met you grandfather,

1:23:32.298 --> 1:23:35.719
and family became another career.

1:23:35.719 --> 1:23:38.471
But I was so disappointed in you.

1:23:40.557 --> 1:23:42.642
- The drugs, the alcohol?

1:23:42.642 --> 1:23:45.937
Well, yeah, but I was disappointed

1:23:45.937 --> 1:23:50.525
because you never let me
teach you how to dance.

1:23:50.525 --> 1:23:52.610
- I know how to dance.

1:23:52.610 --> 1:23:56.281
- What, the gyrating business?
Where nobody touches.

1:23:56.281 --> 1:23:58.867
(upbeat music)

1:24:02.327 --> 1:24:03.913
Look how sexy I am.

1:24:06.332 --> 1:24:09.544
That's not dancing, it's a show.

1:24:09.544 --> 1:24:13.798
Dancing, real dancing, is
two people, hand in hand.

1:24:14.674 --> 1:24:16.593
It's a tandem,

1:24:16.593 --> 1:24:17.594
(enchanting music)

1:24:17.594 --> 1:24:19.471
and it's romantic.

1:24:19.471 --> 1:24:22.849
If you danced, really danced with a girl,

1:24:22.849 --> 1:24:25.309
maybe you'd have a girl,

1:24:25.309 --> 1:24:28.688
maybe things would have
turned out different.

1:24:28.688 --> 1:24:30.732
Dance with me, Jacob.

1:24:30.732 --> 1:24:33.651
(enchanting music)

1:24:41.409 --> 1:24:45.914
- Oh Jacob, I want you to
be happy with this business.

1:24:46.956 --> 1:24:48.041
- Happy?

1:24:48.041 --> 1:24:49.416
- Sure.

1:24:49.416 --> 1:24:52.796
- Why would I be happy to be dead?

1:24:52.796 --> 1:24:56.299
- Well, for some it's better than life.

1:24:56.299 --> 1:24:59.469
- But I don't wanna be
dead, I have a girlfriend,

1:24:59.469 --> 1:25:01.596
we were gonna have kids.

1:25:01.596 --> 1:25:04.849
- Now, I know you haven't a girlfriend,

1:25:05.892 --> 1:25:07.977
I'm death, I know things.

1:25:10.230 --> 1:25:13.691
But, if you wanna tango with death.

1:25:13.691 --> 1:25:16.277
(upbeat music)

1:25:21.491 --> 1:25:23.034
- I never traveled much,

1:25:23.034 --> 1:25:24.827
there's a lot of places
I never got to see.

1:25:24.827 --> 1:25:27.121
- If you lived to be 100,
they'd be places you would say

1:25:27.121 --> 1:25:29.249
you didn't get to see, that's life,

1:25:29.249 --> 1:25:31.166
it's always incomplete.

1:25:35.421 --> 1:25:37.298
- But for some people, like me,

1:25:37.298 --> 1:25:40.093
it's more incomplete than ever.

1:25:40.093 --> 1:25:41.511
- Don't get me wrong,

1:25:41.511 --> 1:25:46.099
I commiserate, but the death
was your choice, not mine.

1:25:47.142 --> 1:25:48.351
- I didn't plan it.

1:25:48.351 --> 1:25:51.938
- Oh, come on, you're not
dumb, you knew the risks.

1:25:51.938 --> 1:25:55.608
It's not like you tripped
in front of a bus.

1:25:56.609 --> 1:25:58.443
- I can't just take all
the moments of my life

1:25:58.443 --> 1:26:01.865
and put them in a box, and pick just one.

1:26:05.034 --> 1:26:06.702
There's some things I had no control over,

1:26:06.702 --> 1:26:10.039
and that should count for something.

1:26:10.039 --> 1:26:11.541
Let's make a deal.

1:26:13.041 --> 1:26:17.505
- Well, I'm sorry, it
doesn't work that way.

1:26:17.505 --> 1:26:19.299
It's time to go.

1:26:19.299 --> 1:26:22.677
(dramatic music)

1:26:22.677 --> 1:26:25.305
- No, no, no, no, no, no, wait.

1:26:25.305 --> 1:26:30.309
I deserve a second chance,
you can change the future.

1:26:30.518 --> 1:26:34.105
I may not be perfect,
but let me try again.

1:26:35.273 --> 1:26:39.693
- I'm sorry, I have other
appointments, other people,

1:26:40.612 --> 1:26:43.948
I can't argue with you forever.

1:26:43.948 --> 1:26:46.409
- Where are you going?

1:26:46.409 --> 1:26:48.995
- Nolan's, guns make busy work.

1:26:53.875 --> 1:26:58.213
It's ironic, you seem to
have spent your entire life

1:27:00.130 --> 1:27:03.134
trying to avoid the real world,

1:27:03.134 --> 1:27:07.472
always looking to go somewhere,
and you knew not where,

1:27:07.472 --> 1:27:10.975
and now I wanna take you to another world,

1:27:12.143 --> 1:27:13.853
and you don't wanna go.

1:27:13.853 --> 1:27:16.356
(door creaks)

1:27:16.356 --> 1:27:20.443
Well, I'm looking forward
to some good jambalaya.

1:27:21.778 --> 1:27:24.530
(whooshing)

1:27:24.530 --> 1:27:27.450
(enchanting music)

1:27:29.285 --> 1:27:30.452
- [Man On Radio] Good job, 44,

1:27:30.452 --> 1:27:32.121
let us know if there's any change.

1:27:32.121 --> 1:27:34.207
See you in 10, peace out.
