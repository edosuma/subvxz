01:03.067 --> 01:04.634
D'oh!

01:07.734 --> 01:10.133
* On the twelfth day of Christmas *

01:10.200 --> 01:12.000
* My true love gave to me: *

01:12.067 --> 01:13.667
* Twelve Grampas grumbling *

01:13.734 --> 01:15.801
* Eleven Barneys belching *

01:15.868 --> 01:17.234
* Ten Lennys leaping *

01:17.300 --> 01:18.934
* Nine Carls dancing *

01:19.000 --> 01:20.434
* Eight Moes a-milking *

01:20.501 --> 01:21.934
* Seven Selmas smoking *

01:22.000 --> 01:23.634
* Six Flanders praying *

01:23.701 --> 01:26.968
* Five... golden... Frinks *

01:27.033 --> 01:28.601
* Four crawling nerds *

01:28.667 --> 01:29.968
* Three-eyed fish *

01:30.033 --> 01:31.467
* Two special Ralphs *

01:31.534 --> 01:36.601
* And a Maggie in a Snuggley *

01:47.167 --> 01:49.634
So what prank are you gonna
lead off with?

01:49.701 --> 01:51.100
The exploding pen.

01:51.167 --> 01:53.701
Don't think I've heard of it.

01:55.033 --> 01:56.701
Let the games begin.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.934
Simpson, that is a rebuilt
Yugoslavian engine.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.801
There isn't even
a Yugoslavia anymore!

02:48.868 --> 02:50.200
Bring it back at once!

02:50.267 --> 02:52.167
You're the boss.

02:57.334 --> 02:59.234
Stupid punishment.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.801
I hate hard work.
Unless it's on pranks.

03:01.868 --> 03:05.200
Shiny enough to see
Skinner's ugly face.

03:06.467 --> 03:07.634
Come with me.

03:09.868 --> 03:11.734
I'll grill your cheese yet boy.

03:11.801 --> 03:13.767
You weren't the first prankster
to destroy

03:13.834 --> 03:15.634
the car I rent from Mother,
and you won't be the last.

03:15.701 --> 03:17.367
Rent?
Rent to own.

03:17.434 --> 03:19.200
Just 35 more payments,
and it's halfway mine.

03:19.267 --> 03:22.033
The point is, I've seen hooligans
like you come and go.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.300
You're all just a big blur
of short pants

03:24.367 --> 03:25.834
and sinister smiles.

03:25.901 --> 03:28.200
Well, maybe so,
but I'm the best.

03:29.467 --> 03:31.033
The best of your era maybe.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.367
Are you saying there was a kid
who was worse than me?

03:33.434 --> 03:34.901
Huh. Way worse.

03:34.968 --> 03:36.033
Anyway, think no more about it.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.300
You're dismissed.

03:37.367 --> 03:38.601
Wait! Wait!
If there's someone worse

03:38.667 --> 03:40.033
I have to know who he is.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.100
He?

03:41.167 --> 03:42.267
It's a she?!

03:42.334 --> 03:43.934
Just kidding. It's a guy.

03:45.334 --> 03:47.334
But let's not dwell on the
mysterious figure from the past

03:47.400 --> 03:49.400
who was your superior in every way.

03:49.467 --> 03:50.467
Out you go.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.267
Milhouse, there was a guy

03:56.334 --> 03:57.701
who pulled even bigger pranks
than me.

03:57.767 --> 04:01.100
Wow! Imagine his sidekick.

04:08.801 --> 04:11.300
Man, if he lost that giant inhaler

04:11.367 --> 04:14.133
he'd really be in trouble
with his parents.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.000
Hmm.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.534
* Tubs are for bath time
and water-splashy fun *

04:21.601 --> 04:25.701
* But there's one thing
that must never be done *

04:25.767 --> 04:27.734
* Poop in the tub *

04:27.801 --> 04:29.634
* Poop in the tub *

04:29.701 --> 04:33.434
* I'm not gonna poop in the tub *

04:33.501 --> 04:35.100
Okay, everyone.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.234
Snack time!

04:36.300 --> 04:38.234
I've got milk and cookies.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.434
Hydroxeos?!

04:40.501 --> 04:42.367
Marge, how could you?!

04:42.434 --> 04:45.033
Those cookies are full of
high-fructose corn syrup

04:45.100 --> 04:46.868
and partially hydrogenated oils.

04:46.934 --> 04:49.234
Have you even read the books
I've read?

04:49.300 --> 04:50.634
But this is from the Kwik-E-Mart.

04:50.701 --> 04:52.334
You and your husband work there.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.234
I would sooner pour
the polluted water of the Ganges

04:55.300 --> 04:57.200
down their gullets than give them
this carton

04:57.267 --> 04:59.167
of cow cancer you call milk.

04:59.234 --> 05:01.667
Sorry. I didn't know.

05:01.734 --> 05:04.434
Marge, until you start serving
healthy food

05:04.501 --> 05:07.601
the midday mommies are pulling you
from snack rotation.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.400
Hydrogenated? Ehh!

05:16.300 --> 05:17.234
Mmm-hmm.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.868
A prankster that awesome

05:18.934 --> 05:20.734
must've made the school paper.

05:23.033 --> 05:24.601
Hmm. Lise,

05:24.667 --> 05:26.100
I just discovered something weird.

05:26.167 --> 05:27.801
Ten years ago,
this paper didn't publish

05:27.868 --> 05:29.667
for two whole weeks.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.234
Now, before the gap,
look at Skinner.

05:36.801 --> 05:38.701
Hmm.

05:38.710 --> 05:41.317
And here he is after the gap.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.467
Hmm, something must've happened
during those two weeks

05:46.534 --> 05:50.200
to turn Skinner from cool to,
as you would say, tool.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.601
I know what happened:

05:51.667 --> 05:53.567
The ultimate prank.

05:53.634 --> 05:58.267
A prank that changed Skinner
from cool to tool.

05:58.334 --> 06:00.000
Is that a backhoe behind him?

06:00.067 --> 06:01.367
Huh.

06:01.434 --> 06:02.567
It is!

06:02.634 --> 06:04.601
Zoom in and enhance.
Mm.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.801
Willie!

06:07.868 --> 06:09.267
He must know the answer.

06:09.334 --> 06:10.934
Before you go, can you
distribute these newspapers

06:11.000 --> 06:12.534
throughout the school?

06:12.601 --> 06:15.467
Well, I'd be a pretty lousy
brother if I didn't.

06:17.434 --> 06:19.234
Willie, I know you witnessed

06:19.300 --> 06:21.234
the most awesome
prank since creation.

06:21.300 --> 06:22.567
Can you tell me about it?

06:22.634 --> 06:24.434
I'll nay speak to you

06:24.501 --> 06:27.000
of those dark times,
Bart Simpson.

06:27.067 --> 06:29.434
But if there was
a more awesome dude than I

06:29.501 --> 06:32.100
I need to know who he was,
what he did

06:32.167 --> 06:33.834
and how many days detention he got.

06:33.901 --> 06:35.567
Something happened.

06:35.634 --> 06:38.234
Something that
changed Skinner, and you.

06:38.300 --> 06:39.701
I haven't changed!

06:39.767 --> 06:41.801
I've always been Swim Teacher Willie

06:41.868 --> 06:43.100
and I always will be!

06:43.167 --> 06:44.634
See, oh...

06:44.701 --> 06:46.434
All right, I'll tell you.

06:46.501 --> 06:49.267
Years ago,
the school had a pool.

06:51.467 --> 06:54.534
I was an eager young swim coach
teaching American youth

06:54.601 --> 06:58.033
the revolutionary Aberdeen crawl.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.667
It was a talented group.

06:59.734 --> 07:01.968
we were all set to go to
the state finals.

07:02.033 --> 07:04.968
I shaved and waxed the boys myself.

07:05.033 --> 07:09.467
Then came the night of the wigglers.

07:09.534 --> 07:11.167
What an awesome day!

07:12.634 --> 07:14.667
Yo, Skin-Man. Little help?

07:14.734 --> 07:16.300
Right back at you, Jason.

07:16.367 --> 07:17.968
Stay in school.
I will!

07:18.033 --> 07:20.834
I am so stoked for my daily swim.

07:22.467 --> 07:24.801
If he stopped whistling,
and looked down

07:24.868 --> 07:27.100
the world wouldn't have changed
that night.

07:27.167 --> 07:30.501
But he didn't, and it did.

07:35.934 --> 07:38.434
Worms!

07:59.000 --> 08:02.300
He spent all weekend in the
crip full of creepy crawlies.

08:02.367 --> 08:04.033
Monday was teacher development day

08:04.100 --> 08:07.300
so Skinner wasn't rescued 'til
Tuesday morn.

08:07.367 --> 08:12.334
By then, he was the twisted monster
you see today.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.868
Shut this pool down,
Groundskeeper Willie.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.200
Willie. Bart.

08:19.267 --> 08:20.300
Monster.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.100
So my ass isn't

08:22.167 --> 08:23.200
the badest
in the history of this school.

08:23.267 --> 08:24.400
Who did it, Willie?

08:24.467 --> 08:26.934
His name is Andy Hamilton.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.868
Andy Hamilton.

08:31.334 --> 08:32.734
But whatever you do

08:32.801 --> 08:38.467
never tell me where you learned his name.
Or I'll kill whoever told you.

08:41.217 --> 08:42.616
Marge, what are you doing?

08:42.683 --> 08:44.984
This junk food has got to go.

08:45.051 --> 08:47.417
It's full of chemicals

08:47.484 --> 08:49.584
transfats and hard-pour corn.

08:50.884 --> 08:52.018
No!

08:56.450 --> 08:57.817
Don't worry, my sweets!

08:57.884 --> 09:00.018
I'll put out the fire!

09:00.084 --> 09:01.517
Homie, no!

09:01.584 --> 09:03.617
That topping is a petroleum
by-product!

09:08.517 --> 09:10.350
Ow!

09:11.851 --> 09:15.550
"Andy Hamilton,
53 Hyperion Drive."

09:15.617 --> 09:18.517
Bart, it's not always a good idea

09:18.584 --> 09:19.851
to meet your hero.

09:19.917 --> 09:22.550
I once followed Santa home
from the department store

09:22.617 --> 09:25.283
and what I saw wasn't pretty.

09:25.350 --> 09:27.183
I can't live my life

09:27.250 --> 09:29.584
knowing there might be someone better
than me at the one thing I'm good at.

09:30.917 --> 09:32.784
Entre and par-tay!

09:35.717 --> 09:37.051
Crazy Glue!

09:37.118 --> 09:39.350
Bart, you've been pranked!

09:39.417 --> 09:40.951
Eh, needs a topper.

09:41.018 --> 09:42.917
Look, somebody had left
glue loosener

09:42.984 --> 09:44.550
just lying around!

09:48.317 --> 09:50.851
Ah! Here it comes.

09:50.917 --> 09:52.851
Ay, caramba!

09:54.283 --> 09:56.118
Man, it is an honor

09:56.183 --> 09:57.951
to meet the guy who
wormed Skinner.

09:58.018 --> 09:59.417
You know, when I was your age

09:59.484 --> 10:00.851
we couldn't film our pranks
for YouTube.

10:00.917 --> 10:02.484
It was local news or nothing.

10:02.550 --> 10:03.684
Potato chip?

10:05.051 --> 10:07.183
Hmm, wait a minute.

10:07.250 --> 10:08.851
Are there spring snakes
in this can?

10:08.917 --> 10:10.617
No, no, no, no, no.
Give me some credit.

10:12.051 --> 10:13.183
It's a real snake.

10:13.250 --> 10:14.084
Whoa!

10:14.150 --> 10:15.951
Don't worry. It's defanged.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.517
Although he can still

10:18.584 --> 10:19.617
rub poison on you
with his gums.

10:22.118 --> 10:24.051
I would really wash that arm
if I were you.

10:24.118 --> 10:27.550
Can I go home now?
You should probably wait.

10:27.617 --> 10:29.550
You're gonna be very sleepy
for the next few hours.

10:29.617 --> 10:31.051
Isn't this the best day of your life?

10:37.118 --> 10:38.450
So you wanna be

10:38.517 --> 10:40.984
Springfield Elementary's next
Andy Hamilton?

10:41.051 --> 10:44.183
Then you'll have to top these
awesome pranks.

10:44.250 --> 10:46.118
The bear traps in gym class.

10:46.183 --> 10:48.150
The fire in the drinking fountain.

10:48.217 --> 10:49.984
And, of course

10:50.051 --> 10:52.350
the fake heart attack on
an international flight.

10:52.417 --> 10:55.350
To land a plane in Nairobi.

10:55.417 --> 10:56.851
Some chick missed her own wedding!

10:58.617 --> 11:01.118
I am impressed.

11:04.484 --> 11:07.283
Andy has the perfect life.

11:07.350 --> 11:09.150
All he does is reminisce
about his pranks.

11:09.217 --> 11:11.051
And when his mom
gets home from work

11:11.118 --> 11:12.617
she makes him
whatever sandwich he wants.

11:13.917 --> 11:15.917
This Andy sounds like
kind of a loser.

11:15.984 --> 11:18.084
How could someone so much
like me be a loser?

11:18.150 --> 11:19.884
* Loser! *

11:19.951 --> 11:21.484
Would a loser have shown
me how to put

11:21.550 --> 11:24.018
printer's ink in a bottom
of shampoo?

11:24.084 --> 11:26.684
I've never felt so clean!

11:26.751 --> 11:28.350
* Looooser! *

11:28.417 --> 11:30.550
Yeah, but, uh, uh...

11:30.617 --> 11:33.450
Dad, Lisa's making me see
things from both sides again!

11:33.517 --> 11:35.217
Lisa, I warned you about that.

11:35.283 --> 11:37.283
Shouldn't Bart have all the
information he needs

11:37.350 --> 11:38.684
to make an informed decision?

11:38.751 --> 11:40.617
Well...

11:40.684 --> 11:42.283
Now you're doing it to me!

11:42.350 --> 11:43.384
Oh!

11:44.584 --> 11:46.584
Mom, what would you do

11:46.651 --> 11:48.884
if someone you cared about
might be a loser

11:48.951 --> 11:50.283
but they thought they were awesome?

11:50.350 --> 11:52.051
Are you talking about your father?

11:52.118 --> 11:53.684
That loser? No.

11:53.751 --> 11:56.617
I'm talking about this guy
who's 19, and never really grew up.

11:56.684 --> 11:58.150
Well, when you
care about someone

11:58.217 --> 12:00.684
it's not out of line
to give them a gentle push

12:00.751 --> 12:01.951
in the right direction.

12:02.018 --> 12:03.917
Got it. Did you wash those carrots?

12:05.150 --> 12:06.317
No.

12:07.951 --> 12:10.118
You could've washed them after
you cut them

12:10.217 --> 12:11.484
but now they're done for!

12:11.550 --> 12:12.617
Oh!

12:14.084 --> 12:16.851
I don't like the looks of
this place, Marge.

12:16.917 --> 12:20.384
I don't see any standees for chips,
standees for soda.

12:20.450 --> 12:22.851
I don't see any standees at all!

12:22.917 --> 12:25.584
From now on, our family is eating
health food

12:25.651 --> 12:28.917
that looks bad on the shelf
but good in our colon.

12:28.984 --> 12:31.084
Why is that man carrying a purse?

12:31.150 --> 12:32.617
That's a reusable grocery bag.

12:32.684 --> 12:34.150
This store doesn't use plastic bags

12:34.217 --> 12:35.951
because they end up in the ocean

12:36.018 --> 12:38.018
and upset jellyfish mating rituals.

12:38.084 --> 12:41.450
Stupid horny jellyfish,
neutering our dudes.

12:42.617 --> 12:45.550
Hmm.

12:45.617 --> 12:47.617
Almond butter,
soy milk

12:47.684 --> 12:49.517
non-soy dairy based soy sauce

12:49.584 --> 12:50.951
steel-cut spelt husk

12:51.018 --> 12:54.118
Chef Soy-R-D soy-based spaghetti,
and soy balls

12:54.183 --> 12:55.984
free-range gluten

12:56.051 --> 12:57.150
ultra-Vegan invisible cheese.

12:57.217 --> 12:58.283
You know, you don't have to

12:58.350 --> 12:59.484
read the items aloud.

12:59.550 --> 13:00.684
I know what they are.

13:00.751 --> 13:04.018
Okay, that comes to $790.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.617
800 bucks?!

13:05.684 --> 13:07.951
Oh, wait. I didn't see
these blueberries.

13:08.018 --> 13:09.283
$830.

13:09.350 --> 13:10.684
Fine. But we're going

13:10.751 --> 13:12.584
to a regular grocery store
next week.

13:12.651 --> 13:14.051
A week?

13:14.118 --> 13:16.084
Without preservatives,
this food won't last a day.

13:16.150 --> 13:18.018
Look.

13:19.717 --> 13:20.917
Oh!

13:26.550 --> 13:29.018
Well I guess they
can go either way.

13:32.550 --> 13:33.717
Oh, God!

13:33.784 --> 13:35.217
I'm in horrible pain!

13:38.917 --> 13:40.984
Andy, man.

13:41.051 --> 13:43.384
Is this the way you wanna
spend the rest of your life?

13:43.450 --> 13:46.150
Having to borrow spray paint
from a ten-year-old kid?

13:46.217 --> 13:47.450
I told you, okay?

13:47.517 --> 13:49.984
I'll pay you back when I get
my allowance.

13:50.051 --> 13:52.517
I mean not this one,
but the one after next.

13:53.884 --> 13:55.317
Oh, God. You're right.

13:55.384 --> 13:57.617
Look, I think I can get you a job.

13:57.684 --> 13:59.051
Krusty owes me a favor

13:59.118 --> 14:01.517
after I perjured myself for him
during a deposition.

14:01.584 --> 14:03.851
You would get me a job?
Thank you, man.

14:03.917 --> 14:06.283
Um, I would keep that on
for the interview.

14:09.984 --> 14:13.617
Hey, hey! If it isn't
my old friend... you.

14:13.684 --> 14:15.183
Krusty, I need a favor.

14:15.250 --> 14:16.617
For you, kid, anything.

14:16.684 --> 14:17.851
Anything at all.

14:17.917 --> 14:18.951
Although I won't read
screen plays.

14:19.018 --> 14:20.183
That's for your protection.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.417
And you can't ride on
my private jet.

14:22.484 --> 14:25.283
And I won't give a struggling
young comic his first chance.

14:25.350 --> 14:27.484
I won't give a broken-down hack
his last chance.

14:27.550 --> 14:29.118
I won't buy you kids booze.

14:29.183 --> 14:30.884
The judge was very clear on that.

14:30.951 --> 14:32.684
Now, what can I do for you?

14:32.751 --> 14:34.817
Oh, I don't sign footballs unless
you're dying

14:34.884 --> 14:37.851
and it reverts back to me after
six months if you're not dead.

14:39.283 --> 14:41.051
As my new second assistant

14:41.118 --> 14:43.951
you've gotta drive me from
my office to the stage.

14:44.018 --> 14:46.751
And if you see anybody
I screwed over on the way

14:46.817 --> 14:47.917
avoid them.

14:47.984 --> 14:49.084
Whoa! Ex-wife!

14:49.150 --> 14:50.250
Former writing partner!

14:50.317 --> 14:51.617
Bookie!

14:51.684 --> 14:53.517
Dog I abandoned!
A.A. sponsor!

14:53.584 --> 14:54.784
Love child!

14:54.851 --> 14:56.051
Tiddly.
Wink.

14:56.118 --> 14:57.484
Tiddly.

14:57.550 --> 14:59.784
Wink. Didn't Andy start work today?

14:59.851 --> 15:01.084
Yes. Tiddly.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.118
Then why is he standing
in our driveway?

15:03.183 --> 15:04.317
Wink.

15:04.384 --> 15:06.784
You were supposed to be at work!

15:06.851 --> 15:09.517
I tried, man. But he was like,
"Do this thing!"

15:09.584 --> 15:10.817
And I'm like, "Why, dude?"

15:10.884 --> 15:12.317
And he's like, "I'm your boss!"

15:12.384 --> 15:13.984
And I'm like, "I quit."

15:14.051 --> 15:16.283
And you're like, "You're supposed
to be at work, man!"

15:16.350 --> 15:17.517
Then I'm like, "What?"

15:17.584 --> 15:18.751
You quit after one day?

15:18.817 --> 15:20.051
Yeah.

15:20.118 --> 15:21.651
But today wasn't a total loss.

15:21.717 --> 15:23.417
On the way home, I got this.

15:23.484 --> 15:25.751
An ice cube with a fly in it.

15:25.817 --> 15:26.984
If that was in your drink

15:27.051 --> 15:28.283
you'd be like,
"I'm not drinking that!"

15:28.350 --> 15:31.118
I stuck my neck out for you,
and you screwed it up!

15:32.350 --> 15:33.550
We're not losers!

15:33.617 --> 15:36.250
No, you two are winners.

15:36.317 --> 15:37.817
Big winners.

15:37.884 --> 15:40.283
When I grow up, I wanna marry
a big winner like you guys.

15:40.350 --> 15:42.317
Shut up!

15:43.418 --> 15:46.617
* Doggies and kitties
don't last forever *

15:47.684 --> 15:50.951
* But they do a lot better
than fish *

15:51.017 --> 15:54.817
* Flush, flush, fish
fish, fish, flush *

15:54.884 --> 15:56.517
It's healthy snack time!

15:56.583 --> 15:57.750
Is it?

15:57.817 --> 15:59.517
We've got sulphite-free grape juice

15:59.583 --> 16:01.650
and home-made organic, non-gluten

16:01.717 --> 16:03.884
fair-trade zucchini cupcakes!

16:03.951 --> 16:04.984
Oh!
Oh!

16:05.051 --> 16:06.550
They don't rise by themselves

16:06.617 --> 16:08.184
so I was up all night

16:08.251 --> 16:10.284
blowing air bubbles into them
with a straw.

16:10.351 --> 16:12.351
Mmm! Delicious.

16:12.418 --> 16:15.318
What percent milk-fat, unsalted
butter did you use

16:15.384 --> 16:16.984
to grease the cupcake tray?

16:17.051 --> 16:18.517
None percent.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.384
I used a non-stick pan.

16:23.817 --> 16:27.051
Don't you know that non-stick pans
are made with P.F.O.A.s?

16:27.117 --> 16:29.318
Oh, boy. Here it comes.

16:29.384 --> 16:32.951
There is only one thing more
dangerous than P.F.O.A.s, Marge.

16:33.017 --> 16:34.884
Plastics made with B.P.A.

16:34.951 --> 16:38.384
Never ever let your child near
any product with the number...

16:40.617 --> 16:41.850
Seven!

16:41.917 --> 16:45.384
Good lord!
They've been sucking seven! Oh!

17:04.217 --> 17:05.384
All right, Andy.

17:05.450 --> 17:07.017
It was not easy to get
your job back.

17:07.084 --> 17:08.849
You did me a solid, man.

17:08.916 --> 17:11.318
And I promise you,
I will not leave this job

17:11.384 --> 17:13.750
unless I flake,
or it becomes bogus.

17:13.817 --> 17:15.318
No, that's not good enough.

17:15.384 --> 17:17.550
I want you to shake my hand
as a fellow prankster

17:17.617 --> 17:19.650
and swear you will try your best.

17:19.717 --> 17:20.717
Psych!
Psych!

17:20.784 --> 17:21.916
We have a deal.

17:25.284 --> 17:26.550
Marge?

17:26.617 --> 17:28.517
Sorry I'm late.
I was working overtime.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.217
So we'd have extra money
to buy fruit salad.

17:33.684 --> 17:35.650
Honey, what are you doing?

17:35.717 --> 17:36.917
Nothing!

17:36.984 --> 17:39.151
Nothing!

17:39.217 --> 17:40.850
It's okay, you can tell me.

17:42.318 --> 17:44.750
I found your stash.

17:45.984 --> 17:50.418
You found the precious!

17:50.483 --> 17:52.318
I know, I know.

17:52.384 --> 17:54.151
I've eaten your transfats

17:54.217 --> 17:55.784
your red dye number 2.

17:55.850 --> 17:56.984
Even this.

17:58.550 --> 18:00.583
Oh, Marge, I'm seeing

18:00.650 --> 18:03.717
a brand-new side of you. Me.

18:06.550 --> 18:08.850
More Lard Glug, my sweet?

18:08.917 --> 18:11.017
I never wanna stop.

18:11.084 --> 18:12.717
Did you know that Lard Glug

18:12.784 --> 18:15.151
contains neither lard, nor glug?

18:15.217 --> 18:16.583
From now on

18:16.650 --> 18:19.784
we'll only make the kids
eat healthy.

18:19.850 --> 18:22.284
I can't believe Andy's
lasted a week.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.384
Yeah, to congratulate him,
I got him

18:24.450 --> 18:26.418
the most grown up thing
I can think of. A Caesar's Salad.

18:27.984 --> 18:29.984
Excuse me, I'm looking for Stage 6.

18:30.051 --> 18:33.251
I've got a delivery for
a Mr. Andy Hamilton.

18:33.318 --> 18:34.750
Right over there.
Ah, thank you.

18:48.017 --> 18:50.051
Louie, have you seen Andy?

18:50.117 --> 18:51.717
I think he's gonna ruin the show!

18:51.784 --> 18:53.784
Eh, he's about 20 seasons too late.

19:07.418 --> 19:09.251
Now to dive in this pool

19:09.318 --> 19:10.750
of clear blue water.

19:21.784 --> 19:23.017
Put me down!

19:23.084 --> 19:24.051
You're ruining the bit!

19:24.117 --> 19:25.884
No! I won't see you end up

19:25.951 --> 19:28.517
like Skinner.
Twisted and deranged.

19:28.583 --> 19:30.384
Watch the Krusty Show,
they tell me.

19:30.450 --> 19:32.450
You'll forget your troubles,
they tell me.

19:32.517 --> 19:34.184
Uh, how much do you weigh?

19:34.251 --> 19:36.917
Oh, 180, maybe 190.

19:36.984 --> 19:39.384
Plus I'm wearing about 30 pounds
of pancake makeup.

19:39.450 --> 19:41.617
And I'm always packing heat.

19:41.684 --> 19:44.051
Plus the owner's manual
for my Cadillac.

19:54.817 --> 19:58.750
I wanted warm water,
not worm water!

20:04.318 --> 20:05.650
What's going on?

20:05.717 --> 20:06.817
Krusty needed a bit.

20:06.884 --> 20:08.318
And I got a great one.

20:08.384 --> 20:11.384
Thanks to my new head writer,
Andy Hamilton.

20:12.684 --> 20:14.884
Bart, thank you for believing
I could grow up.

20:14.951 --> 20:16.917
My pranking days are over
for good.

20:16.984 --> 20:18.650
What's gotten into you, man?

20:18.717 --> 20:20.850
Andrew, I wanted to
show you something

20:20.917 --> 20:23.483
in the makeout room--
uh, makeup room.

20:23.550 --> 20:24.784
I'll be right there
in a minute, babe.

20:26.450 --> 20:29.051
Looks like I just bought
some property on Boner Way.

20:29.117 --> 20:32.117
So now Andy's a TV writer.

20:32.184 --> 20:34.084
Loser.

20:34.151 --> 20:38.418
* Loser, loser *

20:38.483 --> 20:40.251
Loser!

20:41.305 --> 20:47.379
