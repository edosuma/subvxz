00:05.920 --> 00:08.240
The man we're about to meet is the
devil.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.000
My name's Mosley. Oswald Mosley.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.280
You've come to my attention.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.920
Michael Gray.

00:12.920 --> 00:15.600
You lost all your cousin's money in
America, playing the fool.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.880
And poor old Arthur Shelby.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.080
His wife, she's been seen
with another man.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.240
May you Peaky Blinders all rot.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.280
GUNSHOT

00:27.600 --> 00:29.480
If you're going to England,
I'm coming with you.

00:29.480 --> 00:30.560
I want to meet your family.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.640
No, you don't.

00:33.160 --> 00:37.760
Mr Thomas, it is the purest opium
that has ever arrived in Europe.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.680
Â£250,000.

00:39.680 --> 00:42.120
All we have to do is keep it here
for a week.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.480
I vote against it, Tom.

00:43.480 --> 00:45.080
Those in favour?

00:45.080 --> 00:46.240
Motion carried.

00:48.200 --> 00:53.400
We're talking about an empty chair,
Ada. My chair. My throne.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.720
Someone wants my crown.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.040
I think it might be Michael.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.400
Mr Shelby, my name is Captain Swing.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.960
Michael, your kin, was making deals

01:00.960 --> 01:03.280
with the very men who want you
dead.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.800
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.200
It's time.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.360
And you know it.

01:10.440 --> 01:11.680
Let me guess...

01:12.760 --> 01:14.520
..don't fuck with the
Peaky Blinders.

01:14.520 --> 01:18.000
There will be a war
and one of you will die,

01:18.000 --> 01:19.880
but which one I cannot tell.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.720
I'll do what I have to do, Pol.

01:21.720 --> 01:25.080
Kill...and kill.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.320
I have a job for you.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.120
I'm going to shoot Oswald Mosley.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.760
Kill the man, kill the message.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.080
I think it's about time we
got off the stage, old man.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.600
The Chinese, the Italians.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.000
Mosley knew nothing!

01:47.000 --> 01:48.960
He knew nothing!

01:48.960 --> 01:50.400
Who?!

01:56.600 --> 01:57.680
Talk to me.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.400
Maybe I've found him...

02:01.400 --> 02:03.200
..Arthur, the man I can't defeat.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.960
Mosley. I don't know.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.680
I don't fucking know.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.240
Doesn't make sense.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.080
Let's...

02:20.080 --> 02:21.440
Let's go inside.

02:23.240 --> 02:26.760
We'll work it out, have a drink.

02:26.760 --> 02:27.960
I need to walk.

03:11.640 --> 03:13.600
The work's all done, Tommy.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.280
It's all done.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.520
We can walk away from all of this.

03:19.080 --> 03:22.320
It's so easy. It's so soft.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.040
Such a small change.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.520
HE SCREAMS

03:30.960 --> 03:32.000
GUN CLICKS

04:01.760 --> 04:03.520
Arthur took the bullets out.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.040
On the way back.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.960
He said you stopped at
a crossroads to throw up.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.040
You're not even a soldier any more,
Tommy.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.840
You didn't check your weapon.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.720
You're not a soldier,
you're a coward.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.200
I heard you pull the trigger.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.120
Leaving your family behind
without a goodbye...

04:38.320 --> 04:40.040
If you still need a way out...

04:41.840 --> 04:43.400
..here are six of them.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.160
Mother.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.800
They let you pass through.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.280
They wouldn't let me pass.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.520
As if there were to be
another consequence.

PHONE RINGS

07:03.320 --> 07:04.480
Hello?

07:04.480 --> 07:07.400
Mr Shelby, I imagine you're curious
as to who it was prevented

07:07.400 --> 07:10.120
the assassination last night.

07:10.120 --> 07:14.200
If you look out your window,
you'll see a flag of truce.

07:14.200 --> 07:18.720
It's a unit of volunteers bringing
the bodies of your dead to you

07:18.720 --> 07:20.720
to send to heaven in your own way.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.840
Last night's operation was carried
out by soldiers from three

07:25.840 --> 07:28.200
Dublin brigades of the
Irish Republican Army.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.520
We need to keep Mr Mosley alive.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.640
That's all you need to know.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.360
Also, you should know that saving

07:45.360 --> 07:48.200
Mosley's life wasn't our only
intervention last night.

07:52.040 --> 07:55.240
We've made some changes to the
structure of your organisation.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.400
Ever since you began
to build your empire...

08:24.480 --> 08:26.800
..you've had a crutch to lean on.

08:29.280 --> 08:32.560
Last night, we kicked
away that crutch.

08:32.560 --> 08:35.080
From now on, it will be us
that you lean on.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.960
Please be aware, Mr Shelby,
that the deaths of your people...

08:41.720 --> 08:43.760
..are your own responsibility...

08:45.120 --> 08:49.360
..because you consistently fail to
understand your own limitations.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.440
of one man that caused this.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.480
And I swear in the name
of Almighty God...

11:39.240 --> 11:41.400
..no matter what it takes...

11:41.400 --> 11:43.400
..no matter how many lies I have
to tell...

11:46.760 --> 11:48.680
..I will take revenge on
Tommy Shelby.

14:08.560 --> 14:09.680

17:27.800 --> 17:32.240
Windows got broke because a lot of
people here are drunk and angry.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.520
You know?

17:36.560 --> 17:38.920
Half the men on this island
made their living

17:38.920 --> 17:41.080
bootlegging till today.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.040
The other half fixed their boats.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.960
Maybe you should take your water
into the hall.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.360
I learned a lot of things in France.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.920
Island is crawling with
you fucking commissary men.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.360
Closing our warehouses down.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.520
Throwing men out of work.

19:09.640 --> 19:13.760
Ten years our boat ran whisky down
the President Roads to Boston.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.280
Now we have fucking nothing.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.560
And you sit in front of us
and order fucking water.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.880
Is that meant to be a joke?

19:26.880 --> 19:27.920
No.

19:29.600 --> 19:34.920
I ordered water because I no
longer drink alcohol of any kind.

19:39.920 --> 19:45.280
You, my friend, are
going to drink a toast.

19:45.280 --> 19:49.040
You will raise your glass to
the poor people of Miquelon,

19:49.040 --> 19:52.400
whose lives you bastards
have destroyed.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.040
Drink it.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.440
Hey.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.320
Drink.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.520
You're not leaving this bar
until you have raised

20:03.520 --> 20:05.240
a toast to the people of Miquelon.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.360
OK.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.480
OK.

20:18.680 --> 20:23.040
I understand that, today of
all days, you would be angry.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.280
But if you had read my card
instead of burning it,

20:28.280 --> 20:32.760
you would realise that this
is a misunderstanding.

20:32.760 --> 20:36.440
Now, I've been very patient,
given the circumstances,

20:36.440 --> 20:40.160
but you need to sit down
and let me read my newspaper.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.160
Before this goes any further,
please let me explain.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.800
I will not drink your toast

20:59.800 --> 21:01.960
cos four years ago,
I forswore alcohol.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.000

21:13.400 --> 21:15.600
I've become a calmer
and more peaceful person.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.400
Get in.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.640
Sometimes, in moments
of personal conflict...

21:32.040 --> 21:34.760
..I can resort to my old ways.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.160
If this were to happen now,

21:36.160 --> 21:39.480
it would indeed be a black day in
Miquelon.

21:41.320 --> 21:44.080
Now, my guests will be
arriving shortly.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.600
I need to prepare the room.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.720
Hello, Tommy.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.720
There's a man out there having
his face stitched back up.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.600
That was a misunderstanding.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.760
Hello, Michael.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.800
I wasn't sure what I'd think
when I saw you again, Tom.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.560
Oh, yeah?

23:54.560 --> 23:55.680
What do you think?

23:57.520 --> 23:59.760
Since my mother passed
away four years ago,

23:59.760 --> 24:02.560
Tommy and I haven't even spoken.

24:02.560 --> 24:05.240
Well, we've both been very busy.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.200
You've been too busy to punish
the people who killed her.

24:08.200 --> 24:12.040
You know, Michael, when you're
dealing with a very powerful enemy,

24:12.040 --> 24:14.240
taking revenge sometimes
requires time.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.480
You have to...pick your moment.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.320
That moment will come.

24:28.240 --> 24:31.480
But now we have a business
interest in common

24:31.480 --> 24:35.640
and any bad blood will be diluted by
time and a practical self-interest.

24:38.320 --> 24:41.320
Well, Tommy, we're all keen to
hear what you have to say.

24:41.320 --> 24:43.720
I'm very much looking forward
to working with you again, Michael.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.800
You look very well.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.880
You too.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.800

25:01.920 --> 25:07.040
This projector is a gift
from Charlie fucking Chaplin

25:07.040 --> 25:08.920
and he sent it all
the way from Hollywood.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.720
Now sit down and watch the film.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.560
Oh, God. No, Elizabeth, Elizabeth,

25:12.560 --> 25:14.920
don't do that, you're going to hurt
yourself.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.040
Yes, hi. Is that the Bell Tavern?

25:17.040 --> 25:20.080
If there's a gypsy in there called
Johnny Dogs, can you tell him

25:20.080 --> 25:22.600
to come and round up his
fucking kids?

25:22.600 --> 25:24.840
It's Christmas. A time for family.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.440
Mum, I was watching that.

25:33.920 --> 25:37.320
OK, everyone, OK.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.840
We're having this
Christmas party early

25:41.840 --> 25:46.240
because tomorrow, me and Charles
and Ruby are going on a big ship

25:46.240 --> 25:49.360
to Canada, to be with their daddy.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.920
But we told Father Christmas
about the party...

25:53.240 --> 25:54.800
..and he has brought you
all presents.

Race ya! Ada, where the fuck
is Father Christmas?

26:01.240 --> 26:03.840
I don't know.
He was supposed to be here by now.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.560
Yeah. Where the fuck are you, Santa?

No!

26:17.480 --> 26:19.520
Ugggh!

26:19.520 --> 26:20.560
You've got me!

26:22.000 --> 26:24.560
I've got a gun. You'd better run!

26:25.680 --> 26:27.440
You'd better run!

26:28.520 --> 26:31.840
Gentlemen, today is the
last day of prohibition.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.480
But rather than see it as the
end of something, I believe that,

26:34.480 --> 26:38.680
for men like us, it can present...
a new beginning.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.680
A new opportunity.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.000
An opportunity I would like to share
with people I know I can trust.

26:45.360 --> 26:48.960
For the last 12 years,
the men of this island have been

26:48.960 --> 26:50.960
making their living from bootlegging
whisky,

26:50.960 --> 26:53.320
from navigating the waters

26:53.320 --> 26:55.800
and avoiding American
border patrols.

26:55.800 --> 26:58.840
But now that whisky is
about to become legal,

26:58.840 --> 27:03.040
the trade will fall back into the
hands of capitalists from New York,

27:03.040 --> 27:05.080
Boston and Toronto.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.120
But...

27:07.680 --> 27:09.240
..when one door closes...

27:11.680 --> 27:13.480
..another one opens.

27:13.480 --> 27:17.280
We can take advantage of the systems
that are in place on Miquelon Island

27:17.280 --> 27:20.560
and offer selected boat crews the
opportunity to carry on working.

27:20.560 --> 27:23.360
But this time with
a different cargo.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.400
You want me to pour?

27:40.400 --> 27:41.480
No.

27:48.440 --> 27:50.760
Now it's all over
the fucking island.

27:50.760 --> 27:53.240
This is an island with
no morals and no opinions -

27:53.240 --> 27:54.680
just a load of fucking boats

27:54.680 --> 27:58.040
with nothing to carry
and nowhere to go.

27:58.040 --> 28:00.760
The reason why Miquelon was used
to run whisky in the first place

28:00.760 --> 28:03.160
is cos it sits outside
the territorial waters

28:03.160 --> 28:06.040
of both America and Canada.

28:06.040 --> 28:08.640
Technically, it's French territory.

28:08.640 --> 28:11.400
The FBI, the RCMP
have no jurisdiction.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.480
Where do you get this stuff?

28:16.480 --> 28:19.200
I have established a supply
chain over the last four years

28:19.200 --> 28:21.960
with associates in Belfast.

28:21.960 --> 28:25.320
We decided it was time to
break into the American market.

28:25.320 --> 28:29.360
That, my friend, is the
finest opium in the world.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.960
Delivered to my warehouse in
Liverpool directly from Shanghai.

28:35.720 --> 28:39.920
Michael, when it comes to this shit,
you're the expert.

28:39.920 --> 28:42.720
I trust him.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.560
What about the French police?

28:44.560 --> 28:47.960
I have been in communication with
the Miquelon Prefet des Gendarmes.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.040
We fought in two of the
same battles in France.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.960
We consider each other comrades.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.880
I have offered my comrade
12 million francs

28:56.880 --> 29:00.600
if the boats between Miquelon
and Boston keep running.

29:00.600 --> 29:06.040
We will have to take your proposal
to Uncle Jack in Boston.

29:06.040 --> 29:09.000
Perhaps we can meet after you've
spoken with Uncle Jack, Michael,

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
who I believe is your wife's uncle,
Jack Nelson.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.560
Hey! Ha-ha!

29:14.560 --> 29:17.920
The guy knows things
that can get him killed

29:17.920 --> 29:19.560
and he says them out loud.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.560
I have a high regard for Mr Nelson.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.640
He has a history not unlike my own.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.560
Jack Nelson's past is forgotten.

29:27.560 --> 29:30.400
Not forgotten. Fucking gone.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.480
No, not gone, just erased from
the records, like my own.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.000
Give him my regards, will ya?

29:45.800 --> 29:47.600
You haven't touched your drink, Tom.

29:52.880 --> 29:55.760
You know, since we last met,
Michael...

29:57.080 --> 29:58.800
..well, I've become a better man.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.840
I now realise that whisky is just
fuel for the loud engines

30:03.840 --> 30:05.080
inside your head.

30:05.080 --> 30:06.360
LAUGHTER

30:06.360 --> 30:07.640
Catch yourself on!

30:10.640 --> 30:13.520
What is this guy, a fuckin' poet?
Eh?

30:13.520 --> 30:16.640
Oh, I do read poetry,
but I don't yet write it.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.640
They say the fog is going to get
worse.

30:21.640 --> 30:24.440
We'd better get off this island
before it traps us here.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.080
Just understand.

30:29.080 --> 30:32.440
Uncle Jack decides everything, OK?

30:32.440 --> 30:35.960
And I decide when a meeting is over.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.840
So sit down till I say.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.920
TOMMY CLEARS HIS THROAT

30:58.360 --> 30:59.680
Maith fear.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.880
Put some fuckin' hair on your chest,
huh?

31:14.320 --> 31:15.440
Good boy.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.480
LAUGHTER

31:19.000 --> 31:22.960
Now, give us all a poem
before we go.

31:25.640 --> 31:26.920
Want to hear a poem?

31:30.000 --> 31:31.480
Want to hear a poem?

31:34.360 --> 31:37.280
What about you, Brainbox?

31:51.400 --> 31:53.720
I was angry with my friend

31:53.720 --> 31:56.920
I told my wrath, my wrath did end

32:00.560 --> 32:02.280
I was angry with my foe

32:03.400 --> 32:04.720
I told it not...

32:07.000 --> 32:08.680
..my wrath did grow.

32:18.240 --> 32:21.760
It's from The Poison Tree
by William Blake.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.160
You won't have heard of him.

32:25.680 --> 32:26.960
Meeting over.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.360
Oh, and by the way,

32:30.360 --> 32:33.840
my friend, the Police Commissioner,
told me that he'd spoken

32:33.840 --> 32:37.480
to his FBI liaison officer,

32:37.480 --> 32:41.960
and he told him that there is
an informant in your organisation

32:41.960 --> 32:43.560
in South Boston.

32:43.560 --> 32:47.240
I tell you this in the
spirit of corporate hygiene.

32:48.360 --> 32:49.880
Here you are, Michael.

32:54.720 --> 32:58.800
Beware the man with
a bleeding heart tattoo

32:58.800 --> 33:01.920
with "Maria" written in red.

33:04.600 --> 33:05.960
Have a good day, gentlemen.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.680
This time, don't burn it.

33:56.360 --> 33:57.720
Arthur...

34:08.160 --> 34:09.400
Come on, come on.

34:09.400 --> 34:10.440
Tch, God.

34:11.720 --> 34:13.320
Oh, God, if Polly was still here,

34:13.320 --> 34:15.320
she'd never have let it get
this bad.

34:15.320 --> 34:18.040
Come on. Come on, Arthur.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.920
Arthur!

34:19.920 --> 34:23.400
I am not Polly,
but I am still your fucking sister.

34:23.400 --> 34:26.000
You swore to me you
would stop using.

34:27.280 --> 34:30.240
It's Christmas Day, Ada.
Christmas Day.

34:30.240 --> 34:31.960
Yes, it's Christmas.

34:31.960 --> 34:35.080
So where the fuck are
the fucking presents?

34:35.080 --> 34:36.640
I'll be all right in a bit...

34:36.640 --> 34:37.800
HE MUMBLES

34:39.160 --> 34:40.960
Great.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.920
My brother off his face on junk.

34:43.920 --> 34:46.360
Every day there's a question
without an answer.

34:48.360 --> 34:49.680
A leak without a bucket.

34:51.200 --> 34:53.120
Me without a clue what to do.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.480
Fuck.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.440
I love you, Ada.

35:06.680 --> 35:08.920
Children! Father Christmas has been!

35:08.920 --> 35:10.400
Father Christmas!

35:10.400 --> 35:11.680
CHILDREN LAUGH

35:13.040 --> 35:14.200
What did you ask for?

35:15.600 --> 35:17.240
What have we got?
LIZZIE SIGHS

35:17.240 --> 35:21.400
Father Christmas got stuck up
the chimney again, did he? Mmm.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.320
What ship are you on tomorrow?

35:23.320 --> 35:24.520
LIZZIE SIGHS

35:24.520 --> 35:27.280
Oh, the best,
the most expensive one.

35:28.400 --> 35:31.200
And then we'll get there
and Tommy will say,

35:31.200 --> 35:36.080
"Hello, Lizzie. Hello, children,"
in that dead voice.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.920
Come on, Lizzie,
he'll be on holiday.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.600
Being away might change him.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.760
Even on holiday, Ada...

35:44.760 --> 35:46.360
..even on top of a rocky mountain,

35:46.360 --> 35:48.920
he'll be the same way
he's been since Polly died.

35:50.080 --> 35:55.040
No more Polly, no more whisky,
no more Tommy.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.640
Yeah, I'm calling
from Miquelon Island,

36:25.640 --> 36:27.960
from the police station.

36:27.960 --> 36:32.080
There is a boat leaving the island
now, heading across the border.

36:32.080 --> 36:34.520
When it docks at St John's,

36:34.520 --> 36:38.560
a man named Michael Gray will board
a ferry to Boston.

36:38.560 --> 36:40.760
Listen very carefully.

36:40.760 --> 36:43.560
He's wearing a dark coat,
a blue suit,

36:43.560 --> 36:46.040
and carrying a black briefcase.

36:46.040 --> 36:50.360
Inside the briefcase is five pound
of pure, refined opium.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.960
Concerned citizen.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.920
Yeah, my name is Mr Jones.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.560
Yes, I do.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.480
But I don't drink any more.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.800
HE SIGHS

37:16.800 --> 37:17.880
WATCH TICKS

37:20.560 --> 37:22.240
I have business.

37:23.440 --> 37:24.920
I need to get off this island.

37:24.920 --> 37:27.240

37:29.000 --> 37:31.440

37:41.000 --> 37:42.760
Are you going to answer it?

37:42.760 --> 37:45.000
No, I don't work for him any more.

37:49.920 --> 37:51.440
It might be important.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.280
That's why I don't
want to answer it.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.240
Can I answer it?

37:57.240 --> 37:58.520
No.

38:04.760 --> 38:05.920
SHE SIGHS

38:06.960 --> 38:08.680
Hello?

38:08.680 --> 38:09.720
Mmm-hmm.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.320
Fuck.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.520
Do you know who this man is?

38:49.920 --> 38:50.960
SHE SIGHS

39:01.400 --> 39:03.440
All right, come on, Arthur.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.760
HE MUTTERS

39:13.800 --> 39:14.920
HE CHUCKLES

39:16.360 --> 39:18.080
Hey, that tickles.

39:24.120 --> 39:29.160
His brother, Thomas Shelby, says
don't serve him opium ever again

39:29.160 --> 39:32.360
or someone will write Arthur
Shelby's name on your chest

39:32.360 --> 39:33.960
with a bayonet.

40:24.680 --> 40:27.080

40:27.080 --> 40:29.800
I can't talk about anything in here.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.680
I just wanted to see your face
and smell your perfume.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.200
Tommy Shelby steps back into
your life and, right away,

40:35.200 --> 40:36.440
this is what happens.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.040
No names in here.

40:38.040 --> 40:41.360
Sorry. Let's just call him
the devil.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.520
Take a seat.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.880
How is Laurence?

40:46.880 --> 40:50.840
Oh, you know. Missing his father.

40:50.840 --> 40:53.720
What the fuck happened, Michael?

40:53.720 --> 40:54.880
It's in hand.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.080
Whose hand?

40:57.080 --> 41:01.440
No, really. Whose fucking hand,
Michael? Hmm?

41:09.560 --> 41:10.960
Like everything else in this city,

41:10.960 --> 41:13.560
it's in the hand of your Uncle Jack.

41:13.560 --> 41:16.240
I need him to get the charges
lifted and get me out of here.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.960
I already talked to him.

41:17.960 --> 41:21.640
He told me what
the devil proposed.

41:21.640 --> 41:25.040
Tommy Shelby wants to do
business with Jack Nelson?

41:25.040 --> 41:27.120
He wants to take on Boston?

41:27.120 --> 41:29.280
No-one is taking on anyone.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.440
It's in hand.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.280
There are deals being made at
a high level,

41:33.280 --> 41:35.040
but there are some people at
the middle level

41:35.040 --> 41:36.760
and lower levels who cannot be
trusted.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.160
Michael, this sounds fucking...

41:38.160 --> 41:39.520
Shut up and listen.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.520
It was Tommy himself who warned us
of the informant.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.080
We're guessing that the informant

41:46.080 --> 41:48.440
was the one that tipped off the
police about me.

41:49.600 --> 41:52.480
Then the devil's plan
has already begun.

41:52.480 --> 41:55.800
What's the point of ships and
planes if you can't get away?

41:55.800 --> 41:59.760
Gina, in today's paper, you will
read about a man being fished out of

41:59.760 --> 42:01.920
the Boston Harbour with
a bleeding heart tattoo

42:01.920 --> 42:04.120
and the name "Maria"
written on his arm.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.520
Single shot to the head.

42:05.520 --> 42:07.680
Yeah, I know, I read it already.

42:09.720 --> 42:12.240
His death will lead to others.

42:12.240 --> 42:16.600
For this business to work,
we must only use men we trust.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.360
And while the clean-up is being
carried out,

42:19.360 --> 42:21.800
you must keep things to yourself.

42:21.800 --> 42:24.560
You talk loose to anyone,
it'll be me in the harbour

42:24.560 --> 42:26.600
and you'll be the Maria
with the bleeding heart.

42:26.600 --> 42:27.680
Do you understand?

42:33.440 --> 42:35.040
Michael, I just want the truth.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.720
No, fuck that - I need the truth!

42:39.720 --> 42:41.240
Why are you doing business
with him again?

42:41.240 --> 42:45.680
Gina, tell me what you're thinking
of getting Laurence for Christmas.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.920
There are plenty of men who can
supply powder all over the world.

42:48.920 --> 42:51.000
I don't understand why it needs
to be him.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.120
HE SIGHS

42:59.800 --> 43:02.440
Some of my business with
Tommy Shelby is unfinished.

43:04.080 --> 43:06.120
This is my opportunity
to finish it.

43:09.840 --> 43:12.800
So speak to your uncle and
get me the fuck out of here.

What else do you want?

44:22.040 --> 44:26.320
I have a message for
your Uncle Jack.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.360
Tommy, relax.

44:30.480 --> 44:31.680
Have a fucking drink.

44:33.520 --> 44:36.800
You know my uncle's planning on
buying the United States import

44:36.800 --> 44:40.040
licence to all the best Scotch and
Irish whisky distilleries.

44:42.360 --> 44:45.040
He's on his way to London right
now to make those deals.

44:45.040 --> 44:49.440
Every drop in every state
will be another dime for Uncle Jack.

44:49.440 --> 44:53.320
Yeah. He's a very powerful,
very impressive man.

44:54.360 --> 44:58.440
I've only seen photographs -
when he was young, police mug shots,

44:58.440 --> 45:01.960
and, more recently,
in high-society magazines.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.280
I think this represents progress.

45:04.280 --> 45:05.320
Yeah.

45:06.960 --> 45:10.720
And before you tell me what you want
me to tell him,

45:10.720 --> 45:12.280
I have a message from him to you.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.280
No deal.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.040
Hmm.

45:21.960 --> 45:24.800
In England, when someone gets
this close to Tommy Shelby,

45:24.800 --> 45:26.320
it's, "Oh, the horror.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.240
"Oh, the desire...

45:31.920 --> 45:34.920
"..to fall on your knees,
open your mouth and say,

45:34.920 --> 45:38.520
" 'Yes, sir. Please, sir.' "

45:42.800 --> 45:46.320
So it's Uncle Jack you fall on your
knees for, eh?

45:46.320 --> 45:47.680
Not Michael.

45:49.800 --> 45:52.040
He says no deal, Mr Shelby.

45:55.600 --> 45:58.000
You smell of jail, Gina.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.400
And you drink too much.

45:59.400 --> 46:00.440
SHE SCOFFS

46:01.520 --> 46:04.120
Yes, but booze is legal.

46:04.120 --> 46:05.760
Your white powder's not.

46:07.240 --> 46:08.800
Jack has friends in
the government now.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.200
Do you have any idea
how far he's risen?

46:13.040 --> 46:15.760
All the way to the fucking top.

46:17.640 --> 46:20.520
Can't have white powder on his shiny
black boots when he's on his way

46:20.520 --> 46:23.000
to meet the President of
the United States cos,

46:23.000 --> 46:25.920
yeah, that's where he goes now.

46:27.840 --> 46:31.600
So he can't really be taking such
a big risk on such a little deal.

46:33.600 --> 46:35.880
Go home, boy.

46:38.320 --> 46:39.960
Bye-bye, Mr Shelby.

46:42.280 --> 46:43.720
Yeah, you have another whisky, Gina.

46:43.720 --> 46:46.040
Another dime for Uncle Jack.

46:46.040 --> 46:48.400
You mind if I smoke?

46:48.400 --> 46:50.200
If it's legal, it's OK.

46:52.400 --> 46:55.880
Before I go, you should know...

46:58.560 --> 47:02.760
..that it was me who tipped off
the border police

47:02.760 --> 47:04.960
about the contents of
Michael's suitcase.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.960
I'm the reason he's in jail.

47:13.400 --> 47:15.560
I wanted to give your uncle
a dilemma.

47:18.040 --> 47:24.680
His favourite niece's husband banged
up in Boston for smuggling opium.

47:27.360 --> 47:28.520
What does he do?

47:29.800 --> 47:31.560
If he intervenes
and has him released,

47:31.560 --> 47:33.240
how will that play
in the Oval Office?

47:33.240 --> 47:37.120
If he does nothing, how does
that play in South Boston?

47:37.120 --> 47:38.440
Oh, fuck you.

47:42.720 --> 47:44.400
Fine.

47:44.400 --> 47:45.640
Stay here.

47:46.880 --> 47:47.920
Deal here.

47:47.920 --> 47:50.400
Die here, for all I fucking care.

48:00.640 --> 48:03.080
My message to your uncle is this.

48:05.120 --> 48:09.720
If he doesn't want to buy my opium,
I will sell to the East Boston Jews.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.440
Oh, baby.

48:18.760 --> 48:21.880
Do you want to start a fucking war?

48:21.880 --> 48:24.200
With that amount of opium,

48:24.200 --> 48:27.720
the balance of power
between the Irish,

48:27.720 --> 48:31.200
the Jewish and the Italians

48:31.200 --> 48:33.520
would shift heavily in
favour of the East.

48:35.240 --> 48:39.880
I have excellent contacts with
the family that runs East Boston.

48:39.880 --> 48:41.800
The Solomons family.

48:41.800 --> 48:43.440
Maybe you've heard of 'em?

48:45.240 --> 48:50.200
Once you people have accepted that
you must treat us as equals...

48:53.840 --> 48:56.760
..then I think our families
will work together very well.

48:59.320 --> 49:00.960
Have a good day, Gina.

Yes, I'll accept the call.

49:37.320 --> 49:39.080
Hello, Lizzie.

49:39.080 --> 49:40.160
Tommy...

49:41.680 --> 49:43.480
..it's Ruby. She's not well.

49:45.320 --> 49:47.920
She's got a temperature of 101.
Doctor's just left.

49:49.080 --> 49:50.320
What did he say?

49:50.320 --> 49:51.880
He says he thinks it's flu,

49:51.880 --> 49:54.480
but he's going to come
later to check on her.

49:56.360 --> 49:58.040
She's been coughing and...

50:00.520 --> 50:01.680
SHE SIGHS

50:01.680 --> 50:05.480
Tommy, he said it's not a
good idea for us to travel.

50:07.240 --> 50:09.320
We can't board that ship
to Boston today.

50:10.560 --> 50:13.360
That's all right, Lizzie,
don't worry.

50:13.360 --> 50:17.120
Don't worry, you just stay there for
now and get her better and, er...

50:17.120 --> 50:19.560
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
Can I speak to her?

50:19.560 --> 50:21.480
She's sleeping.

50:21.480 --> 50:23.880
Yeah, well, let her sleep.

50:23.880 --> 50:25.120
Let her sleep.

50:26.760 --> 50:30.400
Lizzie, I've got a bit more
business to do here.

50:30.400 --> 50:34.440
Look, you just book a new passage
when Ruby's feeling better.

50:34.440 --> 50:36.480
It doesn't matter if you don't
get here for Christmas,

50:36.480 --> 50:37.920
just as long as you get here, right?

50:37.920 --> 50:41.640
And then I'll get this
business done,

50:41.640 --> 50:45.160
you get here with the children,
and then no more.

50:46.840 --> 50:51.440
And it'll just be us and the
clean air out in the west.

50:51.440 --> 50:53.320
I've found a place in the mountains.

50:53.320 --> 50:55.240
There'll be snow.

50:55.240 --> 50:57.880
Tell Ruby, tell Ruby
I'll build her a snowman.

50:57.880 --> 50:59.160
Hmm.

50:59.160 --> 51:00.960
HE SIGHS

51:00.960 --> 51:03.120
How long has she been coughing?

51:03.120 --> 51:04.960
A few days.

51:04.960 --> 51:07.000
She's been out running wild
with Johnny Dog's kids,

51:07.000 --> 51:08.600
out in the cold by the river.

51:09.840 --> 51:11.160
SHE SIGHS

51:13.320 --> 51:14.680
Are you OK, Tommy?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.240
Your voice, it sounds different.

51:18.240 --> 51:20.440
It's just cold.

51:20.440 --> 51:23.440
I'll get this business done in
Boston...

51:23.440 --> 51:24.960
..and that'll be the end of it.

51:26.840 --> 51:28.240
And then I just want to...

51:30.360 --> 51:33.400
..I just want to pick Ruby up
and hold her in my arms, y'know?

51:34.680 --> 51:36.880
I miss the weight of carrying her.

51:36.880 --> 51:38.760
I gave her her presents early.

51:38.760 --> 51:40.200
She loves them.

51:43.040 --> 51:45.160
But last night, she was burning up.

51:45.160 --> 51:46.920
She was delirious.

51:46.920 --> 51:48.640
She kept talking.

51:48.640 --> 51:51.320
Johnny's kids have been
teaching her to speak Gypsy.

51:52.840 --> 51:54.920
Teaching her to rob and steal,
more like.

51:58.560 --> 51:59.680
When she was delirious,

51:59.680 --> 52:02.400
she kept saying these Gypsy words,
er...

52:04.520 --> 52:09.880
.."Tickner maura, tickner maura, o
beng, o beng," over and over again.

52:11.560 --> 52:13.280
What? Lizzie, what...?

52:14.440 --> 52:16.960
What did you say? What did Ruby say?

52:16.960 --> 52:18.800
"Tickner, tickner maura."

52:18.800 --> 52:20.840
Something like that.
Did she say any...

52:20.840 --> 52:23.640
..did she say any other words
that you didn't understand?

52:25.480 --> 52:27.560
"O beng, o beng." I don't know.

52:27.560 --> 52:29.840
No, Lizzie did she say any
other words in Romany?

52:29.840 --> 52:30.920
Fucking listen to me!

52:30.920 --> 52:33.080
I don't know Romany words, Tommy.

52:33.080 --> 52:34.120
I don't think so.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.360
Just "tickner maura" and "o beng"?

52:36.360 --> 52:37.400
Yes.

52:37.400 --> 52:40.360
Could she see anything when she was
burning up? What could she see?

52:40.360 --> 52:43.120
Oh, fuck. Lizzie, please,
just answer the fucking question!

52:43.120 --> 52:45.880
She said she could see a man.

52:45.880 --> 52:48.880
A man with green eyes.

52:48.880 --> 52:51.800
She was delirious.
She was burning up.

52:51.800 --> 52:53.160
What the fuck is the matter?

52:53.160 --> 52:55.000
Right, listen, Lizzie,
I'm coming home.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.760
Tommy, it's just a fever, love.

52:56.760 --> 52:58.920
Listen to me, I'm coming home.
I'll be on the next steamer back.

52:58.920 --> 53:00.320
You keep her out of school.
You hear me?

53:00.320 --> 53:02.280
You keep her out of school,
you keep her away from...

53:02.280 --> 53:03.920
Tommy... ..keep her away from the
river.

53:03.920 --> 53:06.040
Don't let her ride a horse
or go near a horse.

53:06.040 --> 53:09.800
Tell Johnny Dogs and his wives the
words that Ruby has been saying.

53:09.800 --> 53:10.840
Do you hear me?

53:10.840 --> 53:14.160
Tell Johnny's eldest wife to put
a Black Madonna around her neck.

53:14.160 --> 53:17.160
You listen to Esmeralda the same way
you listen to a fucking doctor.

53:17.160 --> 53:18.200
You hear me?

53:18.200 --> 53:19.560
Fucking Gypsy stuff.

53:19.560 --> 53:23.520
Yes, it is Gypsy fucking stuff,
Lizzie! Yes, it fucking is!

53:23.520 --> 53:24.840
And you get Curly there.

53:24.840 --> 53:27.400
Tell him to stay in the stable
with Ruby's horses,

53:27.400 --> 53:30.760
and you do everything that Johnny
Dogs and his wives fucking tell you,

53:30.760 --> 53:31.880
do you understand me?

53:33.080 --> 53:35.320
I'm sorry, Lizzie.
Do you understand?

53:35.320 --> 53:38.720
OK. I'll do it.

53:38.720 --> 53:40.720
All right, I'm coming home.

53:50.760 --> 53:51.920
Polly?

53:54.040 --> 53:55.160
Polly?

53:58.880 --> 54:00.480
They know I'm trying to get out.

54:01.840 --> 54:02.960
Pol...

54:04.320 --> 54:05.800
..they're coming for me.

54:45.760 --> 54:47.120
You son of a fucking bitch.

54:47.120 --> 54:48.680
You sound American, Michael.

54:50.760 --> 54:52.080
I have to go back to England early.

54:52.080 --> 54:53.920
Let's make this quick, eh?

54:53.920 --> 54:56.000
You just fuck people up and you
run away.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.520
No, this business will continue.

54:57.520 --> 54:59.880
Jack Nelson is also
travelling to England.

54:59.880 --> 55:02.760
To London and to Edinburgh,
to buy import licenses.

55:02.760 --> 55:05.320
How the fuck do you know
where Jack Nelson's going?

55:05.320 --> 55:07.600
Well, I have copies
of his itinerary.

55:07.600 --> 55:09.120
Of his personal correspondence.

55:09.120 --> 55:11.120
Letters from the President of
the United States

55:11.120 --> 55:12.920
and his many mistresses.

55:12.920 --> 55:15.280
I have contacts in his organisation.

55:15.280 --> 55:18.480
An Irishman with a mortgage is
a powerful resource, Michael.

55:20.520 --> 55:22.960
You're dead, Tommy.

55:22.960 --> 55:24.680
You're out of your fucking depth.

55:26.520 --> 55:28.120
You're dead already.

55:30.400 --> 55:32.360
You threatened to sell to the Jews.

55:32.360 --> 55:34.280
And I have contacts in this prison.

55:34.280 --> 55:36.600
These boys here will look after you
during your stay.

55:36.600 --> 55:38.800
I don't need your fucking
people to look after me.

55:38.800 --> 55:40.360
Jack Nelson's getting me
out of here.

55:40.360 --> 55:42.560
Oh, yeah? Is he?

55:44.160 --> 55:45.240
This is a letter.

55:45.240 --> 55:47.480
Here, give him this letter, will ya?

55:47.480 --> 55:50.000
This is a letter from the
President's personal secretary,

55:50.000 --> 55:53.080
suggesting Jack Nelson keep you
in here for a while longer.

55:53.080 --> 55:55.640
Just until the press lose interest,
Michael.

55:58.920 --> 56:00.080
Fuck you.

56:00.080 --> 56:02.480
You'll be released eventually.

56:02.480 --> 56:06.240
And then you can execute your
business with me as before.

56:07.480 --> 56:11.480
Our business being $5 million
for a shipment of powder.

56:11.480 --> 56:14.200
And when the exchange is done,
we can shake hands

56:14.200 --> 56:16.560
and go our separate ways
once more, eh?

56:20.360 --> 56:21.880
So, you didn't learn.

56:23.920 --> 56:26.280
When my mother died at
the hands of your ambition,

56:26.280 --> 56:28.120
you didn't learn your limitations.

56:30.520 --> 56:32.280
I have no limitations.

56:37.680 --> 56:40.560
Oh, and by the way, Michael,

56:40.560 --> 56:43.360
according to Jack Nelson's
personal accounts,

56:43.360 --> 56:47.320
he bought passage for five people
from Boston to Liverpool.

56:47.320 --> 56:50.520
Five people - his wife,
his mistress,

56:50.520 --> 56:53.520
President Roosevelt's son,
himself...

56:55.440 --> 56:56.520
..and Gina Gray.

56:58.960 --> 57:00.840
Gina's coming to London, Michael...

57:01.920 --> 57:04.480
..where I will be happy
to show her the sights.

57:04.480 --> 57:06.600
Fuck! You fucking bastard, Tommy!

57:06.600 --> 57:10.000
Spirits, Boston Irish and
Uncle Jack. You're the devil,
Tommy Shelby!

57:10.000 --> 57:12.440
You're the fucking devil!
I'm ready for the conversation.
