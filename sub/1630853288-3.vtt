WEBVTT

00:09.968 --> 00:11.136
How's it going, John?

00:12.846 --> 00:13.972
I'm okay, Tom.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.393
How is it, being detailed
to the F.B.I.?

00:19.018 --> 00:20.103
It's been interesting.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.939
Yeah, I'll bet.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.358
He's all yours.

00:34.993 --> 00:38.747
- How are you holding up?
- I'm having the time of my life.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.540
It's fucking jail,
what do you think?

00:42.333 --> 00:45.170
I'm so fucked.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.672
I can't believe
this shit is happening.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.090
You're going
to have to feed them.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.426
It's your only hole-card left.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.098
Yeah, well I can't.
Can't or you won't?

00:57.182 --> 00:59.768
Look, you aren't
just a city cop in cuffs,

00:59.768 --> 01:02.812
you're a cop detailed
to the federal drug task force,

01:02.896 --> 01:04.773
and this is a federal case.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.275
And you aren't
just lone cop among others,

01:07.275 --> 01:10.487
you were the supervisor
of a unit that went bad.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.530
They're going
to make an example of you.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.782
You gotta cooperate.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.201
Shit, man.

01:18.077 --> 01:19.204
I just can't.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.793
They're gonna blame you, Tom.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.212
You built that unit, man by man.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.811
You can go in now, Detective.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.154
Close the door,
Danny, have a seat.

02:03.915 --> 02:06.251
Is this is about that rap song?

02:06.251 --> 02:07.418
Look I don't give a shit

02:07.502 --> 02:08.711
that some gangster rapper
doesn't like you.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.380
The fact is we've
gotten a lot of complaints

02:10.380 --> 02:12.715
about you stacking up
over in the Eastern District.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.052
And we're not going to hold it
against you that you do

02:16.052 --> 02:17.971
the kind of police work
that brings complaints.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.056
We just need
to lower the temperature a bit.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.224
Cool things off.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.226
So we're pulling you out
of the Eastern for a while.

02:25.144 --> 02:26.479
Pulling me out?

02:26.563 --> 02:27.856
You're being reassigned.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.901
You're going citywide, Danny.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.903
I'm not putting you
on the shelf,

02:33.987 --> 02:35.864
I'm sending you
to the Gun Trace Task Force.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.409
Welcome to the squad, Danny.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.331
Congratulations.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.375
All right. Yeah.
- We're gonna do big things.

03:23.411 --> 03:24.495
- Back up!
- Back up!

03:27.540 --> 03:29.375
<i>Baltimore is a poster child</i>

03:29.459 --> 03:32.337
for the basic failure
to stop lawlessness.

03:33.087 --> 03:34.964
No justice, no peace!

03:35.048 --> 03:37.467
I have heard your calls
for no justice, no peace...

03:37.467 --> 03:39.302
No justice, no peace!

04:07.956 --> 04:10.208
<i>Where there's
smoke, there's fire.</i>

04:10.208 --> 04:13.878
These officers,
they're 1930s-style gangsters.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.391
Again,
this is the federal system.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.643
No parole...

04:29.602 --> 04:30.687
only good time.

04:32.105 --> 04:36.025
If you get 15 or 20 years,
you're gonna do 13 or 18 of it.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.319
As your attorney,
I'm advising you to...

04:39.570 --> 04:42.490
...racketeering,
conspiracy.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.909
Tom, they got you on
a ten-thousand-dollar robbery.

04:47.203 --> 04:48.788
What can you tell me about that?

04:54.460 --> 04:55.962
The Kitmore Road stop.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.339
Gondo put us up on that one.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.009
Davon Robinson.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.386
Street name, "Wooda."

05:05.388 --> 05:07.181
Why are you so sold
on this shitbird?

05:08.307 --> 05:10.935
I came up around here,
and people I know be sayin'

05:11.019 --> 05:12.603
that the boy Wooda
be getting it,

05:12.687 --> 05:14.605
- that Wooda jamming so--
- Wooda, huh?

05:15.481 --> 05:16.691
I 'wooda' took a big shit

05:16.691 --> 05:18.192
if I knew we'd be
out here this long.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.360
Yeah,

05:19.444 --> 05:21.195
You do take some nasty
motherfuckers, too.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.780
And I was thinking

05:22.864 --> 05:24.824
if you stop consuming
so much food,

05:24.824 --> 05:25.992
then maybe less will come out.

05:25.992 --> 05:29.120
Hey, check this out,
after lunch yesterday?

05:29.120 --> 05:32.248
Hersl went into the can
at The Barn and made a captain.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.541
Aw, hell no.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.126
I had so much of that pit beef,

05:35.126 --> 05:36.461
I went in there
and made a colonel.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.754
Yeah.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.422
Aye, that's
the nigga right there.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.882
Game time, baby.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.261
There he go.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.388
Let's roll.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.644
A wiretap
on a police officer's phone.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.271
I didn't want
to believe it either,

05:55.271 --> 05:56.981
Your Honor, but here we are.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.441
And what we've
already heard from Gondo

05:58.441 --> 05:59.609
on the Shropshire wiretap

05:59.609 --> 06:01.736
justifies going up
on his mobile phone.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.362
We've got him on numerous calls.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.157
More than justifies it.
Your Honor, if I may.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.076
You two are opening
up a two-gallon can

06:08.076 --> 06:09.577
of shit with this.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.204
- Uh-huh.
- Let me ask you this

06:11.204 --> 06:13.247
on this speculation,

06:13.331 --> 06:15.416
how far up the chain of command
do you think this goes?

06:17.710 --> 06:18.753
We don't know.

06:20.046 --> 06:24.509
Well if you need
anything further, I'm here.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.843
Thank you.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.889
Thank you.
Good luck.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.183
What the fuck
was that, Davon?

06:32.183 --> 06:34.602
Led us on a motherfuckin'
car chase, man.

06:34.602 --> 06:35.978
It's 'cause your shit dirty,
right?

06:36.062 --> 06:38.022
You do know your license
is suspended, right?

06:38.106 --> 06:39.357
- What?
- Look, man,

06:39.357 --> 06:41.776
what the fuck are we gonna
find in that car? Just tell me.

06:41.776 --> 06:42.860
What's in there?

06:42.944 --> 06:44.779
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about?

06:44.779 --> 06:46.531
Man, my license is good.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.574
- I pulled right over--
- No you did not pull right over,

06:48.658 --> 06:50.660
all right? You made us go
on a fuckin' car chase, Davon.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.911
And I fuckin hate
car chases, man.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.163
Soon as I saw your lights,
I pulled over.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.666
- Man, y'all on some bullshit.
- We on some bullshit?

06:56.666 --> 06:57.875
Get the fuck out of here.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.377
You know what, you're going
to have plenty of time

06:59.377 --> 07:00.962
to think about this shit
down in booking, all right?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.672
And watch who the fuck
you talking to like that.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.465
- You know who the fuck we are?
- All right, relax. Relax.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.967
You know
who the fuck you talking to?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.051
Relax, man.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.434
Where you working at?

07:15.518 --> 07:18.020
They hirin'?
Can you give them my resume?

07:18.104 --> 07:20.439
No seriously--
- You seem like a good guy.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.943
I tell you what,

07:23.943 --> 07:25.528
just give us that gun...

07:25.528 --> 07:27.822
- ...and we'll take care of you.
- Take care of me?

07:29.115 --> 07:31.868
What gun? Man, I don't know
what you talking about.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.036
Look, my tags are good,

07:34.120 --> 07:35.872
just let my girl
come grab the car.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.332
All our baby stuff
in there, man.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.542
She's gonna need it.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.044
You're right,
your tags are good.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.046
All right.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.757
I'm really trying my best here
to look out for you.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.553
So...

07:50.553 --> 07:55.266
since you don't have a gun,
your words, not mine,

07:55.266 --> 07:57.018
don't mind if we go
back to your place,

07:57.018 --> 07:58.477
and have a little
look-see, right?

08:01.439 --> 08:04.400
But are you getting cooperation?

08:05.610 --> 08:06.944
Cooperation?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.280
All right.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.115
Are people in town
talking to you?

08:11.199 --> 08:13.784
Depends on who I'm talking to.
Uh-huh.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.411
I tried to talk Daniel Hersl

08:15.411 --> 08:17.622
about the complaints
he's received over the years.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.166
- What did he have to say?
- Not much.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.335
Just that he was doing his job.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.086
That the complaints
are proof of that.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.838
Well, problematic to say, but

08:25.922 --> 08:28.174
to some extent
that happens to be true.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.051
A cop who goes on the street,

08:30.051 --> 08:32.720
and uses his cuffs
will get some complaints.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.723
A housecat behind some desk?

08:35.723 --> 08:38.142
No complaints.
Uh, for Hersl alone,

08:38.226 --> 08:41.354
the Board of Estimates has paid
out in settlements over--

08:41.354 --> 08:43.606
Hersl is a mess.

08:43.606 --> 08:47.735
If I get another sustained case
from IAD, he's gone.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.570
Just like Laronde. Believe me.

08:53.407 --> 08:57.787
I'm not defending Hersl here,
or anyone for that matter, and--

08:57.787 --> 09:00.748
Look DOJ has a job
to do here, and I've told you,

09:00.748 --> 09:03.793
I'm not adverse to the idea
of a consent decree.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.544
The more you understand
the situation,

09:05.628 --> 09:06.837
the better for everyone.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.465
Well thank you,

09:09.465 --> 09:12.009
but having done what I do
for as long as I have,

09:12.093 --> 09:14.720
I'm not expecting people
in your department

09:14.804 --> 09:16.806
to volunteer
what I need to know.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.557
Everyone you command

09:18.641 --> 09:20.810
is on the defensive
when they talk to me.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.103
Understood.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.689
And the presumption is that
I couldn't possibly understand

09:24.689 --> 09:27.108
their job,
or what they're facing,

09:27.108 --> 09:29.568
or what is possible,
or what's not.

09:29.652 --> 09:33.656
Well, Baltimore
is an extraordinarily violent

09:33.656 --> 09:35.157
and drug-involved city.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.951
Do you think
that's entirely unfair?

09:36.951 --> 09:39.578
If the job
requires some of the things

09:39.662 --> 09:41.789
that I've already seen,
and already heard,

09:41.789 --> 09:44.625
then I think
it is fair to question

09:44.709 --> 09:46.294
what these people
think the job is.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.129
I took this position
in a department

09:48.129 --> 09:49.839
that has fundamental problems

09:49.839 --> 09:51.674
that haven't been
addressed in years.

09:53.217 --> 09:56.137
And now, the mayor
who gave me the job

09:56.137 --> 09:58.389
is leaving office in November,

09:58.389 --> 10:00.808
and I don't know
who I'm working for.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.936
Meanwhile,
I've got a State's Attorney

10:04.020 --> 10:06.397
who is showboating
the Freddie Gray case,

10:06.397 --> 10:09.483
and has lost the support
of my rank-and-file.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.111
I have a police union
that fights every change,

10:12.111 --> 10:15.197
and I got a job--

10:15.281 --> 10:17.408
I have a job
that changes hands every year...

10:18.200 --> 10:19.785
So...

10:19.869 --> 10:23.414
anyone I try to charge,
or discipline can say,

10:23.414 --> 10:25.207
"Screw him,
he'll be gone in six months."

10:28.461 --> 10:30.546
But telling you all of this,

10:30.546 --> 10:32.757
I still want to turn
this department around.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.556
And what's your name,
little girl?

10:44.810 --> 10:46.812
Clean down here.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.523
Hey, any luck up there?

10:49.607 --> 10:51.567
Yeah man.
Found a loaded pistol.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.071
Pretty lil' Ruger.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.490
Don't say anything.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.492
Daddy--
Shh, baby girl,

10:59.492 --> 11:00.868
everything's going to be okay.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.500
Whoo! What you got?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.127
- Any cash?
- No, just a gun.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.088
- Check that other dresser.
- You bet.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.428
You good, Sarge?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.764
Keep looking. It's--
It's gotta be somewhere.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.016
Yeah.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.311
Shit.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.067
Hey, gun number two!

11:33.651 --> 11:34.819
Yeah, nigga.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.529
What the fuck
I'm talking about, boy.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.406
Ah!
- Quit playing with us.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.157
And he shaved
the serial numbers off.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.742
Look at this shit.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.995
Hey, take the guns downstairs.
Let him see that shit.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.040
Ten-four.
- Bet, here's the ammo.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.293
Get into it. Yeah, boy!

11:51.377 --> 11:55.256
Oh, shit. We found out
one, but two motherfuckin' guns.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.049
Ow, man, look.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.052
He shaved
it's serial numbers off.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.053
Goddamn.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.471
Ain't nothing
in the back room.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.640
You?

12:04.640 --> 12:06.475
Yeah!
- Nah, nothing so far.

12:23.659 --> 12:26.370
Nothing else up here,
y'all ready?

12:26.454 --> 12:28.747
On the Kitmore
Road raid, what you took...

12:28.831 --> 12:30.791
did you spread
that money around?

12:32.710 --> 12:34.378
I got greedy on that one.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.381
I kept it all.

12:38.507 --> 12:41.802
Maybe that's
why the feds know.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.597
Your co-defendants are talking.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.147
Is Kesha with Kesha?
Ah, yes, sir.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.316
Bro, tell her
to tell Kesha to hit me up.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.984
Is that the girl
with the fat ass?

12:56.984 --> 12:58.944
Yo, that's the one I showed you a picture of.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.864
Oh, damn.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.824
Hold on-- Hold on,
baby. One second.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.619
Aye, order me a six-piece combo
with a Sprite, Sarge.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.704
Give me six-piece combo
with Sprite money.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.873
Sarge, I'm almost done

13:10.873 --> 13:12.958
- with that Davon Robinson report.
- Here, take the money, nigga.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.711
Yo. Did we get
any cash out that joint?

13:15.711 --> 13:16.962
- Yeah.
- <i>Standby.</i>

13:17.046 --> 13:18.506
How much money
should I put down?

13:18.506 --> 13:19.840
Money?
Yeah.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.176
Can you add on
a six-piece combo

13:22.176 --> 13:23.511
with a Sprite to that,
sweetheart?

13:23.511 --> 13:25.137
He tryin' to taunt me with that.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.764
Sarge,
Davon Robinson report.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.225
You talkin' about money from the raid we just did?
Yes, yes.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.684
Here's your money right here.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.019
So, how much do you want?

13:32.019 --> 13:33.604
See this weird shit?
Hey!

13:33.604 --> 13:34.980
- Sarge, I'm just saying--
- How much you want?

13:35.064 --> 13:36.899
Seriously, man,
should I put down zero or what?

13:36.899 --> 13:38.192
Oh, come on, man.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.694
If I came across some money,
you'd have known about it, man.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.321
I always fuckin' share.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.157
- Ain't that right, Danny?
- Yeah.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.243
Sergeant always
likes to spread it around, man.

13:49.411 --> 13:52.122
- Like fertilizer.
- You heard him, fertilizer.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.624
Like Gondo's girl's ass.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.000
Hey, shut your ass up.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.627
You wouldn't even know
what to do with all this ass.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.587
Oh, you're still
on the phone with her? My bad.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.630
Yeah, you heard?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.719
Board's gettin'
full of drug players,

14:05.803 --> 14:07.638
but no other cops yet.

14:07.638 --> 14:08.889
Aside from Gondo.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.895
Oh, speaking of which--
<i>All right.</i>

14:14.979 --> 14:16.063
<i>Look, baby.</i>

14:17.147 --> 14:19.358
<i>I'm sorry, lotta dumb shit
going on at work.</i>

14:20.109 --> 14:21.569
<i>You there?</i>

14:21.569 --> 14:23.445
<i>Men make time for
what they want to make time for.</i>

14:23.529 --> 14:25.948
<i>Shit, you been reading
them woman magazines again.</i>

14:25.948 --> 14:27.283
<i>- Look, girl--</i>
- Is that our guy?

14:27.283 --> 14:29.410
He's all the way in the dog
house with his girlfriend.

14:29.410 --> 14:33.080
Missed date night again.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.958
I gotta mark this down
as non-pertinent,

14:35.958 --> 14:38.210
but before I do listen
to some of this ball-busting.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.753
<i>Baby, do you even
know what it means</i>

14:39.837 --> 14:41.005
<i>to be in a motherfuckin' war?</i>

14:41.005 --> 14:42.631
<i>We at war
with half the damn city.</i>

14:42.715 --> 14:44.091
<i>The shit you talk. Oh, my--</i>

14:44.091 --> 14:45.384
<i>For real,
we're bringin' in guns,</i>

14:45.384 --> 14:47.428
<i>we snatchin' drugs,
one case to the next.</i>

14:47.428 --> 14:49.513
<i>And I'm keepin' you with
all the court pay and overtime</i>

14:49.597 --> 14:51.265
<i>- and workin' my ass off--</i>
- To hear him tell it,

14:51.265 --> 14:54.435
he's a hero.
<i>And here you come to bust on me for this shit.</i>

14:54.435 --> 14:57.146
Drug war justifies a lot.

14:57.896 --> 14:59.565
<i>Yeah, I can do that.</i>

14:59.565 --> 15:01.025
<i>Okay.</i>
All right.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.526
<i>Who's better
than you, kid?</i>

15:02.610 --> 15:03.986
<i>Swear to God, dude.</i>

15:03.986 --> 15:06.155
<i>All right, let's do it then,
come on. You got that?</i>

15:06.155 --> 15:07.573
<i>I've got
a half-dozen humps</i>

15:07.573 --> 15:08.782
<i>and Wayne fuckin' Jenkins.</i>

15:08.866 --> 15:10.618
What'd you bring
in this time, Rook?

15:10.618 --> 15:11.994
I've got the four-five,

15:11.994 --> 15:15.080
three Z.'s bagged, QP of weed
and a little over three grand.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.374
Born to work plainclothes, ain't you?

15:17.458 --> 15:18.959
You know how it goes, Sarge.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.086
It's what we do. One second.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.921
What's going on, baby?

15:23.005 --> 15:25.966
He what? Hang on,
slow down. He what?

15:26.050 --> 15:27.134
<i>The contractor showed up.</i>

15:27.134 --> 15:29.053
He's still there?

15:29.053 --> 15:31.180
Okay. No, don't sign nothing,
all right? You just--

15:31.180 --> 15:33.057
You just keep him there,
you understand me.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.184
No, keep him there,
I'm on my way.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.269
- Motherfucker.
- What's up?

15:37.353 --> 15:39.772
This contractor asshole
just changed up all the quotes

15:39.772 --> 15:42.316
on Kristy for the new house.
I gotta go, man.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.984
I gotta go straighten
this motherfucker out.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.570
Now? Who's gonna submit
all this shit at ECU?

15:48.072 --> 15:49.823
- Sarge, my wife needs me.
- Fuck her needs!

15:49.907 --> 15:51.700
Take your fucking skirt off,
and get over here.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.826
We got work to do.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.291
All right, come on.
Let's bag it up then.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.834
- Yeah, let's bag it up.
- All right.

16:07.758 --> 16:08.759
Shit, man.

16:10.052 --> 16:13.222
Fuck me, man.
Always a line down here, dude.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.766
I fucking got places
I gotta be.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.685
Man, we all got
somewhere to be.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.103
Aye, man, no, I really do.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.356
Here we go, man.
Fuck you, Wayne.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.024
Golden boy.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.609
Oh, look at you
all proud and shit.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.735
What this your first time
down here?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.195
Come through with a BB gun,
or something?

16:28.195 --> 16:30.030
I know that look, asshole.
What's in the bag this time?

16:30.114 --> 16:31.532
I mean you know me. Jackpot.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.701
Quit bragging, dude.
- That's the way it is, man.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.703
Aye, you got a big dick,
you wear tight pants.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.663
Just because you plainclothes
Flex Squad motherfuckers get

16:37.663 --> 16:39.289
to do what you want.
Running all wild and shit.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.916
We're hunters, dawg.
We get to hunt.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.042
Yeah.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.877
Jenkins, get your ass
to the front of the line.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.295
Oh, I can do that.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.755
- Appreciate you, Sarge.
- Hey.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.216
You keep giving me good stats,
I'll get you what you need.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.385
Jesus, get a room, you two.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.262
Hey, man, you know
who that is right?

16:53.262 --> 16:55.097
That's Mickey Fries, man.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.432
He's got
Southeast flex, man,

16:56.432 --> 16:58.267
but I'll tell you what he got
the whole Eastern shook!

16:58.267 --> 17:00.728
Motherfuckers be yellin',
"Hey, Mickey Fries out!

17:00.728 --> 17:02.938
Mickey Fries out!"
Everybody starts runnin'.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.064
That's real police, man,

17:04.148 --> 17:05.524
you don't know nothing
about that.

17:05.524 --> 17:08.569
Just sign the forms. I'll stay
around to process everything.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.572
- I appreciate you, Sarge.
- Now go help your wife.

17:11.572 --> 17:14.158
- Yeah, you know I will.
- Family man.

17:14.158 --> 17:17.828
Aye, you keep it sexy, bro.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.080
Special Agent Jensen,

17:20.164 --> 17:22.541
you are hereby relieved of duty.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.461
You're early.
But I won't complain.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.628
Anything to note?

17:27.796 --> 17:29.006
Pretty quiet.

17:29.006 --> 17:32.050
Couple of false starts
that turned into non-pertinents.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.261
Well, you get out of here,
and get yourself some rest.

17:34.261 --> 17:38.223
No rest for me.
I've got flute practice.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.893
- As in, the woodwind instrument?
- Mm-hmm.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.062
- Wow, flutist.
- Flautist.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.274
I flaut. Call me
if anything pops off.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.405
Hey.

17:53.489 --> 17:58.243
Young'un.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.790
Holy shit.
As I live and breathe.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.291
I heard you were a housecat now.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.043
Just biding my time.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.295
Trying for an even 30
before I put in my papers in.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.422
- Where were you before?
- Permanent midnight,

18:10.506 --> 18:13.091
Sector Two.
Like my days to myself.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.635
Before that,
I had the Flex Squad.

18:14.635 --> 18:18.180
But fuck it, son.
I got out of there.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.640
You didn't like plainclothes?

18:19.640 --> 18:21.850
Man, I didn't like
what we were doing.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.144
Jumping out on old heads
and children.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.772
Everybody gettin' paid,
and nothing gettin' no better.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.776
This job, man, it's changed.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.654
Guess you glad you got to homicide, right?

18:33.654 --> 18:34.863
Murder's still murder.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.324
What you doing up here?

18:38.033 --> 18:40.661
You got a Jaquan Dixon?

18:40.661 --> 18:42.496
His name is on a report
I'm interested in.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.705
Check out back.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.749
Charlie shift is shaping up,
so he's probably there.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.584
Tall young brother
with a light beard.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.004
- Be easy, Billy.
- You too, man.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.967
Jaquan Dixon?

18:55.884 --> 18:57.469
- All day.
- Suiter,

18:57.553 --> 18:58.971
Homicide.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.722
Uh-oh. Big time.

19:00.806 --> 19:01.890
Yeah, looking for some help

19:01.974 --> 19:04.184
on a shots-fired call
you handled last week.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.227
The one on Hilldale.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.812
At the old lady's house.
What about it?

19:06.812 --> 19:08.272
Call came in anonymous, right?

19:08.272 --> 19:10.482
Yeah. Bunch of assholes
popping off but no one gets hit.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.817
Get any names
from anyone?

19:11.817 --> 19:14.361
By the time we roll up,
everybody been gone.

19:14.361 --> 19:15.779
Why are you pulling it up now?

19:15.863 --> 19:17.364
It's half a block
from my murder.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.032
I have the Fenwick case.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.701
Right. The dude in the alley.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.830
Well,
it was just a hunch,

19:24.830 --> 19:26.331
in case, you caught
a name or two.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.959
Uh, no names, but--

19:28.959 --> 19:31.545
I was one of the last guys
at the scene,

19:31.545 --> 19:33.714
and this did happen
at a grandma's house,

19:33.714 --> 19:36.258
and I wanted to make sure
she was good. But--

19:36.258 --> 19:38.886
I guess she was,
'cause her old ass blew me off.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.805
You got the casings, right?

19:41.889 --> 19:42.848
What?

19:42.848 --> 19:44.141
I submitted
spent casings to ECU.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.602
Five of them. Also a spent round
that broke a car window.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.562
- You did?
- My sergeant said fuck it,

19:48.562 --> 19:50.522
why bother if, you know,
no one was shot.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.274
But I mean, I don't mind
a ride downtown

19:52.274 --> 19:53.567
and a little paperwork.

19:53.567 --> 19:57.571
- My man, respect.
- Mm-hmm.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.823
You wanna roll up through
the scene?
It's right up the street.

19:59.907 --> 20:03.493
Come on.

20:03.577 --> 20:04.828
TARIQ TOURÉ: <i>I look at my son,</i>

20:04.912 --> 20:07.873
and can't help
but see the facts between us

20:07.873 --> 20:11.501
that there could easily
be a piece of glass between us.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.712
So I kiss the ground
every night,

20:13.712 --> 20:16.298
I never know
when my time's up.

20:16.298 --> 20:19.176
To be a Black man in America

20:19.176 --> 20:22.971
is to live every
day in a lineup.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.765
- LISTENER 1: That's right.
- LISTENER 2: Uh-huh.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.018
Let's hear it one more time

20:28.018 --> 20:29.811
for West Baltimore's own,

20:29.895 --> 20:31.021
Tariq Touré.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.106
He is truly a voice,

20:33.190 --> 20:34.691
and this city is lucky
to have him.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.444
Yeah.
- Alongside his fellow panelists,

20:37.444 --> 20:38.612
D. Watkins...

20:40.197 --> 20:42.366
...Dr. Zauditu-Selassie,

20:42.366 --> 20:44.785
he'll be in the back
signing books.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.662
Hey, remember
to pay for 'em first.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.247
And thank you all

20:49.331 --> 20:53.752
for coming out.

20:54.586 --> 20:55.712
TOURÉ: Fact of the matter is,

20:55.796 --> 20:57.589
I'm not really
a political writer.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.508
You should probably
go talk to D.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.634
Oh, I will,

21:00.634 --> 21:02.427
but people told me
I should reach out to you

21:02.511 --> 21:05.973
because of the work you do
on racism and police violence.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.683
So, how long
have you been doing this?

21:07.683 --> 21:08.934
Feels like forever,

21:09.768 --> 21:11.478
but I started going extra hard

21:11.478 --> 21:13.981
after Freddie Gray
was killed, you know?

21:13.981 --> 21:18.110
We already knew how trash
our police department was.

21:18.110 --> 21:22.322
Trash. But the world
got to take it in.

21:22.406 --> 21:26.827
Mm-hmm. So, what's your take
on the mayor's race?

21:26.827 --> 21:30.872
Politics drains the souls
of righteous people.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.040
They volunteered to work

21:32.124 --> 21:33.625
at the slaughterhouse.
All of them.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.794
Okay, and the new
Police Commissioner?

21:35.794 --> 21:39.423
Kevin Davis? You know,
he gives out his personal cell.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.759
Says he has an open-door policy
for everyone in the community.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.177
- He does that?
- I mean, yeah,

21:44.261 --> 21:45.554
but he doesn't
pick up the phone.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.348
In my experience.
I mean, I called him twice.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.059
Davis is also a politician,
right?

21:51.143 --> 21:54.855
Anybody who can keep
Gray's killers on payroll,

21:54.855 --> 21:57.524
plus those brutal cops
who were plastered

21:57.524 --> 21:59.609
in that long article in the <i>Sun,</i>

21:59.693 --> 22:03.780
with their crimes on display,
city payouts, right?

22:03.864 --> 22:09.703
And you cannot
clean the floor with a bucket
of dirty water, now can you?

22:09.703 --> 22:12.039
Dirty water
can still put out a fire.

22:15.292 --> 22:18.545
Not the fires in this city.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.007
<i>So, I'm seeing
this chick, Misty.</i>

22:22.007 --> 22:25.010
Classic Highlandtown whore,
fried hair,

22:25.010 --> 22:26.762
smells like an ashtray.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.013
With bad perfume on top.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.599
Man, pull up
on these two right here.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.690
What's
going on, gentlemen?

22:39.941 --> 22:42.194
You guys do me a favor,
and just wrap things up for us?

22:42.194 --> 22:43.570
Go on inside the house.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.739
What you mean? We live here,
man. We not doing nothin'.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.574
- Yo, chill.
- Aye, my man.

22:47.574 --> 22:50.619
Did you hear me say
you were doing something?

22:50.619 --> 22:53.163
We got a lot going on tonight,
we need the streets clear.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.248
So go inside. Now.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.209
<i>Standby.</i>
- Let's go.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.961
Appreciate it.
Get the fuck outta here.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.963
So, Misty used to strip
right over at the Ritz.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.965
- Yeah.
- You know, on Broadway?

23:04.049 --> 23:05.842
Big ol' ass for a white girl.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.429
Man, circle around
on these two, man.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.182
What the fuck? Fucking kids.

23:21.149 --> 23:22.943
Aye, man I tried
to fucking be nice.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.112
We need a backup unit, 500 block of North Milton.
- Now you're going to jail,

23:25.112 --> 23:26.238
- you understand me?
- Don't move, man.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.781
- Fuck off them steps.
- These my steps.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.658
- I ain't goin' nowhere.
- Your steps, motherfucker?

23:32.244 --> 23:33.954
Don't fucking fight me, motherfucker.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.956
- Hands, you motherfucker!
- Stop!

23:35.956 --> 23:38.125
You want to talk
that fucking shit?

23:38.125 --> 23:40.252
Say it again. Still want to talk
that fucking shit?

23:40.252 --> 23:42.420
Christ, come on.
That's enough, Wayne. Christ.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.506
Yeah, now it's enough.
The fuck is that about, man?

23:44.506 --> 23:46.174
Chill, Wayne.
That's my fuckin' brother, man.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.717
- Hope you feel better about yourself!
- You got a big fucking mouth,

23:47.801 --> 23:48.885
you know that?

23:48.969 --> 23:51.638
That's fucked up!

23:51.638 --> 23:53.181
OFFICER 1: Give my keys back.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.891
OFFICER 2: Are you
about to go for some coffee?

23:54.975 --> 23:56.351
OFFICER 3: Get your arrests up,
then coffee!

23:56.351 --> 23:58.145
They say you wanna see me, Sarge?
Shut the door.

23:58.937 --> 23:59.896
Okay.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.568
- What's going on?
- Brother, you fucked up.

24:05.026 --> 24:06.820
Big time.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.864
I mean, two guys
enjoying a beer on their steps?

24:08.864 --> 24:10.866
- What the fuck, dude?
- What, those assholes?

24:10.866 --> 24:12.576
They came back on it?
You left witnesses.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.327
And a fucked-up arrestee
who had to go to Hopkins

24:14.411 --> 24:16.454
for stitches. They came in
with a pretty legit complaint.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.331
Yo, look, I gave them
a chance. I told them

24:18.415 --> 24:20.208
they had to get the fuck
on inside. I mean, that's--

24:20.292 --> 24:22.502
- I circled the block. One of them mouths off to me.
- Wayne!

24:22.586 --> 24:24.254
You could lose your job
over shit like this.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.007
Lose my jo--

24:28.550 --> 24:32.012
Hang on. Hang on.
Look, maybe things...

24:32.012 --> 24:34.139
you know, got out of hand.
You know, maybe-- maybe--

24:34.139 --> 24:37.475
- maybe I took it a little bit--
- What?

24:39.644 --> 24:42.063
Are you guys--

24:42.147 --> 24:43.857
Aw, you guys
are fucking with me?

24:44.983 --> 24:47.694
Aw, fuck, Sarge.
- Wayne, calm down.

24:47.694 --> 24:49.529
You're an earner
and you work your ass off.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.907
We are always
gonna protect you.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.993
But seriously,
you could've been nailed.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.912
Problem is,
you half-assed the paperwork.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.372
Look, I-- I'll be honest
with you I just--

24:59.456 --> 25:02.125
I didn't really think this was much of anything.
Look here.

25:03.460 --> 25:06.504
Always start with the attack.

25:06.588 --> 25:09.174
The threat to your safety
can never be mentioned enough.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.427
- Yeah.
- See? It has to seem standard,

25:12.427 --> 25:14.221
to anyone looking
at this...

25:14.221 --> 25:16.223
...that you and any other officers

25:16.223 --> 25:18.225
were in serious danger.
I know.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.227
I don't even see the part
in here about the broken bottle.

25:20.227 --> 25:21.811
I had to hear about
that from your partner.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.688
Yeah, yeah. Look,
that fucker, he didn't--

25:23.772 --> 25:25.565
He didn't just drop it,
I mean, yeah, he did.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.317
He threw it right at me.
I mean, luckily LT,

25:27.317 --> 25:28.818
I'm an elite athlete.

25:28.902 --> 25:30.445
Yeah, I mean,
he would have hit me

25:30.445 --> 25:33.281
right in the fucking grill
if I hadn't been so nimble,
you know? So...

25:33.365 --> 25:34.824
No, you're right, Sarge.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.910
I just didn't think
this one mattered, I got--

25:36.910 --> 25:39.454
- I got sloppy.
- Rewrite that sumbitch, okay?

25:39.454 --> 25:41.206
All right, I-- I'm on it.

25:42.666 --> 25:43.792
You motherfucker,

25:43.792 --> 25:45.335
you scared the shit out of me, man

26:04.396 --> 26:05.397
<i>What up?</i>

26:05.397 --> 26:07.232
<i>Yo, you got it done, right?</i>

26:07.232 --> 26:08.358
<i>Just pulled them over.</i>

I'm thinking Thai.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.288
<i>He better.</i>
- Gondo's on the line.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.872
<i>But you hold up,
we ain't rushing it.</i>

26:22.956 --> 26:25.166
<i>'Cause

26:45.270 --> 26:47.439

kind of strange.

26:54.988 --> 26:57.991

29:34.689 --> 29:36.900
Your girl got a point.
Nice one, Gondo.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.152

29:41.196 --> 29:43.281

29:57.712 --> 30:01.633
Yeah, that's her. She wouldn't

Uh, people don't
like to talk to us.

30:04.135 --> 30:05.386
I wonder the hell why.

30:06.721 --> 30:08.806
Shells were scattered
right over there by the curb.

30:12.018 --> 30:14.896
Car window
was shattered over here.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.689
Looked inside and there
was a pretty clean bullet

30:16.773 --> 30:19.275
sitting on the back seat,
plain as day.

30:28.618 --> 30:29.869
Young lady, can I talk to you?

30:29.953 --> 30:31.621

- This my boyfriend's house, why?

30:35.959 --> 30:37.085
What's your boyfriend's name?

30:37.085 --> 30:39.128
- Sir, what do you want with us?
- What's his name?

30:40.588 --> 30:42.924
Tae. Nobody did anything,
can I go?

30:42.924 --> 30:44.592
Okay, one sec. What's your name?

30:44.676 --> 30:46.261
- Ebony.
- Ebony.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.846
Do you or Tae own a gun?

30:50.181 --> 30:51.933
I'm gonna go in the house.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.393
I'm not arrested, right?
No,

30:53.393 --> 30:54.686
but we're gonna find out
what happened,

30:54.686 --> 30:56.854
and where those bullets
we found out here came from.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.898
When we do,
somebody's gonna get locked up.

30:58.982 --> 31:01.067
- Can I go?
- Have a fine day.

31:06.906 --> 31:08.491
Miss Ebony
got something to hide.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.368
Yeah.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.537
<i>I live here.</i>

31:13.580 --> 31:15.081
Do you understand me?

31:15.081 --> 31:17.917
Y'all come and go,
but I live here.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.128
- I understand.
- So do I, Ms. Greene.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.546
This is my post.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.715
You remember, I tried to talk to
you about this the other day,

31:23.715 --> 31:25.800
- when it happened.
- I guess you think you doing good policing

31:25.800 --> 31:27.218
up this neighborhood.

31:28.344 --> 31:30.930
Ma'am, we want to do a good job.

31:31.014 --> 31:34.142
Now, I understand why you feel
how you do about police.

31:34.142 --> 31:37.061
But a good man died
around the corner from here.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.396
I mean, a working man,

31:39.022 --> 31:39.939
just like me.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.275
Me and that clean brother
up on your wall.

31:43.901 --> 31:45.945
I was in the service too.
Is that your husband?

31:46.029 --> 31:47.155
My late husband.

31:49.032 --> 31:50.867
You know, we were
one of the first Black families

31:50.867 --> 31:52.160
to buy up on this block.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.787
It was beautiful.

31:54.871 --> 31:57.915
Believe it
or not, it was beautiful.

32:00.585 --> 32:01.628
Mrs. Greene...

32:03.212 --> 32:05.673
we're not asking you to come
to court or anything like that.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.133
We just need a little help.

32:08.968 --> 32:10.386
Can you tell us anything?

32:10.470 --> 32:11.804
Anything at all
about the shooting

32:11.888 --> 32:13.264
that took place
across the street?

32:14.015 --> 32:15.183
Any little thing will help.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.774
Miss Ireane, up on the corner,
she has a grandson.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.068
That boy's a devil.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.904
A true devil.

32:30.865 --> 32:31.949
That's all I have to say.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.786
- One more thing--
- That's all I have to say.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.373
But in that sense,
Ms. Steele,

32:38.373 --> 32:39.832
I'm not sure
what we could tell you

32:39.916 --> 32:41.542
that is going
to change your mind.

32:41.626 --> 32:44.629
You folks came into town
with these preconceived notions,

32:44.629 --> 32:48.049
and you're gonna act on those,
no matter what we tell you.

32:48.049 --> 32:51.219
We came to town
because the newspaper here

32:51.219 --> 32:53.262
reported on all
the cash settlements

32:53.346 --> 32:54.555
the city had paid out

32:54.639 --> 32:56.808
to victims of police misconduct.

32:56.808 --> 33:00.561
- A string of brutality cases--
- Claimed misconduct.

33:00.645 --> 33:01.896
Those settlements did not admit

33:01.896 --> 33:03.481
to any fault
on the part of the officer.

33:03.481 --> 33:06.109
But cash settlements nonetheless.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.194
And sufficiently
concerning is that

33:08.194 --> 33:11.823
the mayor invited an outside
assessment of the department.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.741
The same mayor
who lost control of the city

33:13.825 --> 33:15.952
and let the Freddie Gray riots
tear through downtown.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.328
Do you believe the new mayor

33:17.412 --> 33:19.580
will be more sympathetic
to your officers?

33:19.664 --> 33:21.457
It's not as
though Catherine Pugh

33:21.541 --> 33:22.834
is running on law and order.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.545
We'll see. But if she ties
up this department

33:25.545 --> 33:29.507
in a federal consent decree
and we can't police effectively,

33:29.507 --> 33:32.427
then she'll have the same
political problems as Stephanie.

33:36.305 --> 33:38.307
Can I ask you something,

33:38.391 --> 33:42.019
not as the union president,
just for my edification?

33:43.146 --> 33:46.357
Are Baltimore police engaged
in a work slowdown

33:46.441 --> 33:48.401
because of the Freddie
Gray indictments?

33:50.486 --> 33:52.405
Arrest numbers are way, way down

33:52.405 --> 33:55.283
even as violence
in the city is up.

33:55.283 --> 33:59.203
The union does not in any way
endorse a job action.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.249
But if you're asking
if there are officers

34:03.249 --> 34:06.043
who won't risk indictment
for trying to clear a corner,

34:06.919 --> 34:08.045
or make an arrest...

34:09.297 --> 34:11.048
I think
that's probably the case.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.593
Would you risk your freedom
for trying to make an arrest

34:13.593 --> 34:15.803
if you knew a prosecutor
might come behind you

34:15.887 --> 34:17.597
with an indictment
for false arrest?

34:17.597 --> 34:19.056
If the arrest is legitimate.

34:19.140 --> 34:21.559
You're talking about
probable cause. Ms. Steele,

34:21.559 --> 34:24.353
the courts themselves
keep changing their mind

34:24.437 --> 34:27.023
on-- on the rules of
when we can detain,

34:27.023 --> 34:29.942
or stop-and-frisk,
or arrest someone.

34:30.026 --> 34:32.403
Every year, the Supreme Court
has a new version

34:32.487 --> 34:34.238
of what the Fourth
Amendment says.

34:34.322 --> 34:37.325
And here comes Mosby,
our State's Attorney,

34:37.325 --> 34:40.244
not only charging a murder
because Gray died

34:40.328 --> 34:42.955
of undetermined causes
in the back of a police wagon,

34:43.039 --> 34:45.666
but charging the officers
who arrested that man,

34:45.750 --> 34:48.544
who had a knife,
for false arrest.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.588
Charging them criminally.

34:50.588 --> 34:53.508
If any Baltimore cop doesn't
want to risk using his handcuffs

34:53.508 --> 34:55.968
after seeing all that...

34:56.052 --> 34:57.345
...can you blame him?

34:57.345 --> 34:59.055
And when all the acquittals
come in...

35:00.264 --> 35:01.766
and they will...

35:01.766 --> 35:04.644
we'll see if we go through another round of riots...

35:04.644 --> 35:06.813
...or the new mayor
will defend the city.

35:06.813 --> 35:08.481
Could there ever be a moment

35:08.481 --> 35:12.652
where a police officer performed
their job in such a manner

35:12.652 --> 35:14.695
that you would agree
with a finding

35:14.779 --> 35:18.324
that he or she should be fired
for abusive behavior

35:18.324 --> 35:21.285
or brutality? Could that
ever happen in Baltimore?

35:21.369 --> 35:23.371
- Certainly.
- Has it ever happened?

35:29.585 --> 35:31.712
We are a labor union,
Ms. Steele.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.174
We are here
to support our members.

35:38.886 --> 35:40.346
<i>I'm gonna need it for bail.</i>

35:40.346 --> 35:41.931
<i>They gave me back your wallet,</i>

35:41.931 --> 35:43.307
<i>and it was empty.
There was nothing.</i>

35:43.391 --> 35:44.684
<i>Most of it
wasn't in the wallet,</i>

35:44.684 --> 35:46.894
<i>it was in the money clip.
The cash was all in my clip.</i>

35:46.978 --> 35:48.396
<i>They didn't
give me back no clip.</i>

35:48.396 --> 35:49.981
<i>Thievin' fucking cops took all of it. Shit.</i>

35:49.981 --> 35:51.858

to get me out of here.</i>

40:20.376 --> 40:21.502
I don't think so.

40:21.502 --> 40:22.837
- I think so.
- I don't think so.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.672
- Can we negotiate a little bit?
- Mm.

40:24.672 --> 40:28.050
Don't worry about it, bro,
I got this. Go on.

40:28.134 --> 40:29.677
For real?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

40:29.677 --> 40:31.846
I got you, man. Here.
See? He got you.

40:31.846 --> 40:35.182
Ooh. Shit, you worked the man.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.475
Let's go. Wait,

40:36.559 --> 40:38.185
you're not police, are you?

40:38.269 --> 40:39.353
Come on, girl.

40:39.353 --> 40:41.856
Man, fuck the police.
All right, all right.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.691
And that's just
for starters, all right?

40:43.691 --> 40:44.817
Oh, okay.

40:44.817 --> 40:46.819
- You take care of my boy.
- Oh, you already know.

40:46.819 --> 40:49.071
You already know, D.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.281
You already know!

40:50.281 --> 40:52.491

- Let's go. Double D!

40:52.575 --> 40:55.369
- ♪ ♪
- So, how's Baltimore?

40:56.579 --> 40:57.997
I'd like
to say I've seen worse,

40:57.997 --> 41:00.124
but I can't remember where.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.126
Half the department
has quit working

41:02.126 --> 41:04.044
to protest
the Freddie Gray indictments,

41:04.128 --> 41:06.422
and the other half
can't stop beating on people.

41:06.422 --> 41:09.383
And both halves tell me
the job can't be done legally.

41:09.383 --> 41:12.428
Assuming she wins
in November, which she should,

41:12.428 --> 41:14.013
will the new mayor
be cooperative?

41:14.013 --> 41:16.140
Pugh? Well,
we haven't met her yet.

41:16.140 --> 41:19.435
But Police Commissioner Davis,
he tells me that he doesn't know

41:19.435 --> 41:21.812
if she's on board
for the consent decree.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.355
That's different
from Rawlings-Blake.

41:23.439 --> 41:25.441
Davis thinks
that her campaign donors,

41:25.441 --> 41:27.026
the developers, are telling her

41:27.026 --> 41:29.570
that the consent decree
will bankrupt the city.

41:29.570 --> 41:32.948
- What do you think of him?
- He says the right things.

41:33.032 --> 41:34.867
To me, he's pro-reform,

41:34.867 --> 41:36.827
caught between rocks
and hard places.

41:37.119 --> 41:38.954
But?

41:39.038 --> 41:41.916
I get that he inherited a mess
of a department,

41:41.916 --> 41:43.751
but I just...

41:43.751 --> 41:46.587
...I don't see a man ready
to take on the status quo.

41:46.587 --> 41:49.131
He told me privately,
he's never seen a department

41:49.215 --> 41:51.634
where so few cops
are interested in police work.

41:51.634 --> 41:53.594
That he doesn't know
who he can rely on.

41:53.594 --> 41:55.387
He said that?

41:55.471 --> 41:57.514
He told me something else.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.892
He said he thinks
he's got cops stealing.

41:59.892 --> 42:01.685
Yeah,
I'm hearing that too.

42:04.521 --> 42:05.981
So, how are things here
in Washington?

42:06.065 --> 42:09.818
A little nauseous right now,
what with these early primaries.

42:09.902 --> 42:12.321
I mean, can you believe it?

42:14.073 --> 42:17.076
Where you been?

42:17.076 --> 42:19.578
- On the street.
- No, seriously.

42:19.662 --> 42:20.996
I was on the street.

42:24.917 --> 42:29.505
God damn.
Yes, yes, yes. I got a match.

42:29.505 --> 42:31.715
- Two good bullets.
- Which case?

42:31.799 --> 42:33.425
Fenwick case.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.844
The Fenwick bullet
matches what else?

42:35.928 --> 42:38.389
A shots-fired call
around the corner.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.724
Bullets from a shots-fired?
No vic?

42:40.808 --> 42:43.227
Who the hell recovers a bullet
on that shit? Seriously.

42:59.660 --> 43:01.328
Ebony.

43:01.412 --> 43:05.958
Ebony. Where's Tae?
I need to talk to him.

43:05.958 --> 43:07.793
Look, do not play with me.

43:07.793 --> 43:10.254
He's a suspect in a murder,
and if I find out

43:10.254 --> 43:11.964
you're hiding him,
you're going to jail too.

43:11.964 --> 43:13.674
You know what? Fuck this.
Let's go downtown. Come!

43:13.674 --> 43:15.217
Uh, at his cousin's house,

43:15.301 --> 43:16.844
by that McDonald's
off of North Avenue.

43:16.844 --> 43:19.346
- I don't know the address.
- Pull your phone out.

43:19.430 --> 43:20.889
Pull it out.

43:20.973 --> 43:23.183
I'm gonna give you one chance to help yourself...

43:23.267 --> 43:24.476
...and you need to take it.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.353
Was Tae involved in the shooting
that happened around here?

43:27.396 --> 43:29.732
Call him. Tell him
to meet you here, now.

43:29.732 --> 43:31.692
Do you really want
this kind of trouble?

43:31.692 --> 43:33.068
Is this guy worth it?

43:39.575 --> 43:42.369
Work, work, work,
work, work, work, work.

43:55.341 --> 43:57.259
Rayam
and Gondo gave us this one.

43:57.343 --> 44:00.012
Davon Robinson?
- A.K.A. Wooda.

44:00.012 --> 44:02.723
Allers robbed him right in front
of his girl and two children.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.725
If he had been
so good as to share it

44:04.725 --> 44:06.060
with Gondo and the others
on the raid,

44:06.060 --> 44:07.770
they might not be putting him
in so quickly now.

44:07.770 --> 44:09.063
Where's Robinson now?

44:09.063 --> 44:11.315
Not D.O.C. and not courtside.

44:11.315 --> 44:14.068
I don't see anything
on the active docket.

44:14.068 --> 44:16.779
Well, let's talk to him. Part
of tightening up these cases

44:16.779 --> 44:18.530
is getting the victims
to cooperate.

44:18.614 --> 44:20.157
Put some of these guys
on the stand,

44:20.157 --> 44:21.533
and you make it real to a jury.

44:21.617 --> 44:22.993
I don't think
he's going to agree

44:23.077 --> 44:24.536
to testify against police.

44:24.620 --> 44:27.122
Well, he might when we tell him
Allers and the rest

44:27.206 --> 44:28.457
are already locked up.

44:28.457 --> 44:30.667
And the U.S. Attorney's Office
is going to look out for him.

44:31.710 --> 44:33.295
Let's bring him in
and I'll lay it out.

44:42.429 --> 44:45.641
Help y'all?

44:45.641 --> 44:48.560
Hello, I'm Erika Jensen,
with the FBI.

44:48.644 --> 44:52.022
Is Davon Robinson around?
We'd like to talk to him.

44:52.106 --> 44:54.233
- FBI?
- Mm-hmm.

44:54.233 --> 44:55.692
You looking to speak with Davon?

44:57.945 --> 45:00.155
Grandma, can you
come get this baby?

45:01.824 --> 45:03.409
It's pretty.

45:07.329 --> 45:08.414
Thank you.

45:16.964 --> 45:18.298
Is this Davon's daughter?

45:19.758 --> 45:21.677
Looks more
like her daddy every day.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.688
All right.

45:33.522 --> 45:35.691
That takes care of Devante Brim.

45:35.691 --> 45:36.942
In you go.

45:36.942 --> 45:39.528
Now let's give his house
a good toss and find some guns.

45:51.331 --> 45:53.542
Shit, she almost likes you.

46:05.262 --> 46:07.014
I didn't
hear the garage door.

46:07.014 --> 46:08.474
I left the car in the driveway.

46:08.474 --> 46:10.350
I was trying not
to make too much noise.

46:12.519 --> 46:13.562
How was work?

46:14.980 --> 46:16.064
Actually...

46:17.441 --> 46:19.359
work was really good.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.612
That's a switch.

46:21.612 --> 46:23.572
A murder is down 'cause of me.

46:25.073 --> 46:26.742
Me and a cop,

46:26.742 --> 46:29.077
a kid who actually
did his damn job.

46:30.329 --> 46:31.330
It's down.

46:32.748 --> 46:35.125
It wouldn't be down
without us. So...

46:35.209 --> 46:37.628
...work was just about perfect.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.713

51:35.425 --> 51:37.093
You're doing this, sir.

51:37.177 --> 51:39.554
This ain't me, it's you.
I gave you a shot, right?

51:39.638 --> 51:42.057
You want to say something now?
Should we keep going?

51:45.185 --> 51:47.103
How about that?

51:47.187 --> 51:50.106
Still don't want to say shit?
How about that? Fuck!

51:59.074 --> 52:00.492

52:02.077 --> 52:03.745
- Fuck you, Wayne.

52:03.829 --> 52:05.330
You're a fucking faggot.

52:05.330 --> 52:07.332
Ooh! It's like that, huh?

52:07.332 --> 52:09.334
You're a choir boy. Ain't
nothing tough about you, bitch.

52:09.334 --> 52:10.544
Is that right?
- I got you.

52:10.544 --> 52:11.711
Is that right?

52:11.795 --> 52:13.296

52:18.260 --> 52:20.387
Take the cuffs off, I'll buss

52:20.387 --> 52:22.180
You wanna fucking
call me a faggot, motherfucker?

52:22.264 --> 52:23.974
Wayne!
This ain't no regular table.

52:23.974 --> 52:27.394
Come check the table!
This ain't no regular table!

52:32.524 --> 52:34.651
Ain't fucking scared of you.

52:34.651 --> 52:36.069

Mm-hmm, okay.

53:04.556 --> 53:05.932
You got

53:06.016 --> 53:07.851
Somebody going away a long time.

53:07.851 --> 53:09.477
Fucking jackpot up in here.

53:09.561 --> 53:11.146
Oh, yeah.

53:13.565 --> 53:15.066
Hey, get them guys in here.

53:18.320 --> 53:20.572

Fucking powerboat out there.

53:55.065 --> 53:56.399

What you think, man?

53:59.486 --> 54:01.112
Shit, Wayne.
Huh?

54:01.196 --> 54:02.656

54:02.656 --> 54:03.949

54:05.033 --> 54:06.618

So, we got the brick,

54:07.786 --> 54:10.288

54:11.706 --> 54:14.292
Say about four Gs

54:14.376 --> 54:16.544
You know something, I'm going

54:16.628 --> 54:17.879

54:17.963 --> 54:19.089
Wait, Wayne.

54:19.089 --> 54:21.007

54:21.091 --> 54:23.009

54:23.093 --> 54:24.678
They're going to get

54:24.678 --> 54:27.097
Call a camera crew, big dawg.

54:27.097 --> 54:29.057
That's some beautiful
fucking police work.

54:30.141 --> 54:31.893
Congratulations.

54:46.032 --> 54:48.076
A decorated police officer.

54:48.076 --> 54:50.996
Do you know how many guns
he's taken off the street?

54:50.996 --> 54:52.622
How many lives he saved?

54:53.540 --> 54:55.000
He's a family man.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.293
And has served this city
for most of his adult life.

54:57.377 --> 54:59.796
Decorated police officer.

54:59.796 --> 55:01.256
Hero cop, huh?

55:05.135 --> 55:06.636
What you got me accused of here?

55:08.179 --> 55:09.973
Taking some money?

55:09.973 --> 55:14.769
Okay, yeah,
maybe. But I did my job.

55:14.853 --> 55:17.355
I brought guns and drugs
off these streets.

55:20.275 --> 55:21.401
I never hurt no one.

55:22.694 --> 55:25.488
- You never hurt anyone?
- Fuck no.

55:25.572 --> 55:27.365
What about Davon Robinson?

55:29.242 --> 55:31.077
- Who?
- The young father

55:31.161 --> 55:34.039
that you took 10,000 from.
The raid on Kitmore Road.

55:34.039 --> 55:36.374
Supplement report
saying no money seized,

55:36.458 --> 55:37.667
but we know different.

55:39.169 --> 55:41.296
Don't we, Sergeant Allers?

55:41.296 --> 55:43.048
<i>That ten grand you stole?</i>

55:43.048 --> 55:45.759
- It's about that time.
- Make sure you pick up some milk on your way back.

55:45.759 --> 55:48.136
<i>Davon Robinson
owed it to his supplier.</i>

55:54.392 --> 55:56.311
<i>Those kinds of street debts...</i>

55:57.771 --> 55:59.147
<i>...don't get forgiven.</i>

56:00.273 --> 56:02.317
Oh, shit.

56:07.447 --> 56:08.823
Hey, let's go, nigga!

56:08.907 --> 56:10.867
Peel off. Peel off. Go, go!

56:29.677 --> 56:32.597
I'll, uh, confer with my client.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.687
Fuck you.

56:40.772 --> 56:41.773
Okay.

56:51.783 --> 56:53.868
How about when
I called him a gorilla, dawg?

57:00.792 --> 57:02.794
I'll tell you what, Brass
gonna be sucking our dicks

57:02.794 --> 57:06.339
for this one, man. Probably
get a medal or some shit.

57:06.339 --> 57:08.967
That was a good-ass eye
on that table, man. That was...

57:10.426 --> 57:12.679
Man, you got an eye, dawg.

57:12.679 --> 57:14.806
That was some serious
police work, man.

57:15.932 --> 57:17.517
A good day.

57:17.517 --> 57:19.227
Bet your ass it was a good day.

57:23.523 --> 57:25.525
I don't know, man. Shit.

57:26.860 --> 57:28.862
What you don't know, man?
It's yours, you earned it.

57:31.114 --> 57:32.991
Man, you don't realize
what happened today, man.

57:32.991 --> 57:34.701
That was a bad motherfucker.

57:34.701 --> 57:37.078
A bad fucking person, and
we got him off the street, man.

57:37.162 --> 57:38.663
- Yeah, but--
- We got his guns and his dough.

57:38.663 --> 57:40.248
Hang on, let me finish.

57:40.248 --> 57:42.000
You know, we could've
died today, right?

57:44.252 --> 57:45.461
Walk in that shop...

57:46.963 --> 57:48.339
motherfucking heads blown off.

57:50.300 --> 57:51.551
That risk sure as shit
ain't worth

57:51.551 --> 57:54.095
what I bring home every
two weeks, man. Fuck that.

57:56.014 --> 57:58.057
My babies can't eat
no fucking medal, Sean.

58:00.018 --> 58:02.020
Or folded flag,
'cause I took a bullet

58:02.020 --> 58:04.814
for a city that don't
give two fucks about us.

58:04.898 --> 58:07.108
What do we do this for?

58:11.738 --> 58:12.947
This is a lot.
