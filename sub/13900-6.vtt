00:03.250 --> 00:05.670
[Mal] To my oldest son
getting married today.

00:05.710 --> 00:06.750
I'll tell you what my
father told me.

00:07.880 --> 00:09.760
I'm proud of you.
But never forget.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.510
I can still take you.
Cheers.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.090
Cheers to most of that.

00:14.970 --> 00:16.350
And that goes for Jake too.

00:16.390 --> 00:19.680
Yeah, well I -
[bang] Arrgh! Arrgh!

00:19.720 --> 00:22.020
Stupid friggin' thing!

00:22.060 --> 00:24.190
Stop complaining. It's either
that or back to prison.

00:24.230 --> 00:25.810
Yeah, I'm gonna have to be
wearing every day

00:25.860 --> 00:27.110
until
the stupid trial,

00:27.150 --> 00:27.320
[Christian]
Not necessarily.

00:28.650 --> 00:29.400
You could petition the court to
have it removed-

00:30.110 --> 00:30.400
For good behaviour.

00:31.530 --> 00:32.360
In that case,
it'll be on for life.

00:32.400 --> 00:32.610
[laughter]

00:33.950 --> 00:34.860
[Ned] I have some experience in
matters of the

00:34.910 --> 00:35.120
ankle monitor variety.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.410
All you have to do
is accidentally

00:37.450 --> 00:38.410
leave your leg in a freezer

00:38.450 --> 00:38.740
for about two hours.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.370
Then poof!
There she was- gone.

00:41.410 --> 00:42.500
Are you wearing a blazer?

00:42.540 --> 00:44.920
No, just a thick outer shirt.

00:49.420 --> 00:51.090
You call this a Stag Party?

00:51.130 --> 00:52.550
I really hope you're gonna
kick it up a notch.

00:52.590 --> 00:54.260
What do you know
about Stag parties?

00:54.300 --> 00:55.340
Relax. I'm not on the pole.

00:55.380 --> 00:56.640
Pole?
Sloan!

00:58.180 --> 01:02.140
Stop talking. Look go meet
Ruby. She's dying to meet you.

01:02.850 --> 01:03.770
My favourite uncle.

01:04.600 --> 01:04.890
Oh, and Rose wants to know

01:06.230 --> 01:07.770
if you've bought your suit
for the wedding yet.

01:07.810 --> 01:08.020
I'm gonna say no.

01:09.610 --> 01:12.900
Hahaha. You gotta by a new
suit. That must be killing you.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.780
Unlike you, I
always have a plan B.

01:14.820 --> 01:15.110
B'ys, it's gonna be a
deadly ceremony.

01:16.740 --> 01:16.950
Although I'm gonna need a bit
more notice for your next one.

01:18.410 --> 01:20.200
[Christian] I know a bar is not
the best venue. But-

01:20.240 --> 01:22.450
Thanks to Jake being not
exactly mobile,

01:22.490 --> 01:23.660
I guess
we got no other choice.

01:23.700 --> 01:23.910
[Des]
Do not worry, okay?

01:25.210 --> 01:26.790
Because I decked out our
entire gym for our prom.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.130
You know those little tissue
flower things?

01:28.170 --> 01:28.380
I made twenty
thousand of 'em.

01:29.670 --> 01:29.920
I was at it for
forty eight hours straight.

01:31.130 --> 01:32.300
I ended up sleeping in,
missing the prom.

01:32.340 --> 01:32.710
But I heard it
was lovely.

01:34.090 --> 01:36.130
What's the big rush? You
getting married right now?

01:36.170 --> 01:39.050
No rush. Ruby and I are just
excited about life together.

01:40.260 --> 01:40.560
I know that's hard for you
to comprehend.

01:42.010 --> 01:43.470
Since you marriage lasted,
like, an hour and a half.

01:43.520 --> 01:43.890
Eleven months.

01:45.140 --> 01:45.350
He couldn't even make the
paper anniversary.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.560
And that one's idiot proof.
Almost.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.440
Hahaha.
That was a good one.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.440
Jake, could I please see
you for a second?

01:52.690 --> 01:54.150
Look, I was a lot younger.
It was different.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.740
[Christian]
Different because it was you.

01:57.490 --> 01:57.820
It's not my fault

01:59.280 --> 02:00.240
that you and Leslie are on
some kind of weird break.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.080
Leslie and I are not
on a break.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.250
She just needs to
stay away from me.

02:05.290 --> 02:07.370
Because it's not good for
her to be around me.

02:07.410 --> 02:09.000
You know what? Just shut up
and mind our own business.

02:09.040 --> 02:09.250
[Ned]
Jake!

02:10.250 --> 02:11.590
Could I possibly see you
about a

02:11.630 --> 02:13.250
possible scheduling conflict?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.550
Hey, hey! That guy didn't
pay for his beer.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.010
Hey!

02:19.640 --> 02:20.140
Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:21.260 --> 02:22.640
What the hell are
you guys doing here?

02:22.680 --> 02:24.310
You're in the
wrong spot, obviously.

02:24.350 --> 02:26.310
Actually, they're not. This
would be the

02:26.350 --> 02:27.690
scheduling
conflict.

Christian was so adorable.

02:56.380 --> 02:57.720
Look at him.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.510
I realize this seems rushed.

03:01.300 --> 03:01.590
But we love each other.

03:02.720 --> 03:03.890
We don't judge in
this family, Ruby.

03:03.930 --> 03:04.760
I'll drink to that.

03:05.890 --> 03:06.180
You know, Christian's
always felt like

03:07.600 --> 03:09.310
he's been a bit of a
disappointment to your family.

03:09.350 --> 03:09.690
Well, Christian's
had a hard road.

03:10.980 --> 03:12.940
He's made a lot of really
interesting choices.

03:12.980 --> 03:15.020
But we love the
guy unconditionally.

03:15.070 --> 03:17.860
So. When are we gonna
meet your family?

03:17.900 --> 03:19.650
My mom died when I was young.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.490
And my dad can't make it.

03:21.530 --> 03:22.780
I know that story.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.280
We should get going.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.410
We have a wedding to plan.

03:26.450 --> 03:28.160
- We do.
- [message sound]

03:36.000 --> 03:37.380
[Rose]
Yeah, I know.

03:37.420 --> 03:38.340
Something's off.

03:39.590 --> 03:40.470
Yup.

03:41.510 --> 03:42.840
[Jake]
You booked a funeral.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.260
That's why you're all
dressed up.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.430
What? No.
This here is a wake.

03:47.140 --> 03:48.310
For Carson Hickley.

03:48.350 --> 03:49.730
The man was like
a father to me.

03:49.770 --> 03:50.020
So you booked a wake-

03:51.440 --> 03:53.310
In the bar on the same days
as my brother's wedding.

03:53.350 --> 03:55.480
Have you been drinking the
leftover pints again?

03:55.520 --> 03:57.270
Are you trying to ruin
Christian's wedding?

03:57.320 --> 03:57.650
What? This wasn't me.

03:58.650 --> 03:58.940
- Ned did it.
- I didn't do it.

04:00.530 --> 04:00.780
You should know what's going
on in your own establishment.

04:02.070 --> 04:03.280
Christian's over there trying
not to come over

04:03.320 --> 04:04.280
here and kill ya.
So fix it.

04:04.320 --> 04:04.660
You heard the man. Fix it.

04:05.830 --> 04:06.160
-I can't.
-Wrong answer, Ned. Fix this.

04:07.660 --> 04:08.410
Or I swear to God, you're
gonna get a boot in the chops.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.580
Look, Carson's death
was no accident.

04:12.160 --> 04:15.170
I think it was murder. And I
need you to help me prove it.

04:18.380 --> 04:19.590
What's with the dead body?

04:19.630 --> 04:21.090
Jake's gonna look after it.

04:22.090 --> 04:23.340
It's your wedding day.

04:23.380 --> 04:25.390
I might give you the talk.
Son-

04:25.970 --> 04:26.220
I gotta ask you.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.850
Are you sure you're
sure about this?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.270
The biggest step you'll take.

04:31.310 --> 04:33.810
I love her. I do. I love her.

04:33.850 --> 04:35.600
You can always put this on
hold for a bit.

04:35.650 --> 04:36.730
Until things calm down.

04:36.770 --> 04:37.440
It's fine, Dad.

04:38.150 --> 04:38.360
Honestly, I'm sure.

04:39.980 --> 04:43.530
I just- I wish Ruby had someone
here to see the day. That's all.

04:45.450 --> 04:46.620
Would you look at that?

04:49.080 --> 04:50.830
Buddy who ran
out on his bar bill.

04:50.870 --> 04:51.790
What's he up to now?

04:51.830 --> 04:52.750
Hi There.

04:53.330 --> 04:53.670
Tell me Ned.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.130
What is it about this that
makes you suspect

04:56.170 --> 04:56.460
there was foul play?

04:57.840 --> 04:59.170
I've known Carson Hickey ever
since I was a kid.

04:59.210 --> 04:59.590
I went to school with his son.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.380
And his daughter Victoria
kinda had a thing for me.

05:02.420 --> 05:03.920
It was a bit much, to be
honest with ya.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.880
- What's your point?
- The point is-

05:05.930 --> 05:06.220
Carson was a health freak.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.850
Then all of a sudden he just
drops dead of a heart attack.

05:09.890 --> 05:12.390
All due respect, Ned. Get your
dead pally

05:12.430 --> 05:13.430
off my friggin'
pool table.

05:14.350 --> 05:16.100
[Ned] Too late. Wake's starting.

05:16.140 --> 05:16.730
There's Carson's daughter
Victoria.

05:18.190 --> 05:21.570
Watch the chemistry. It's a
bit embarrassing, really.

05:21.610 --> 05:23.400
She's okay with you having her
father's wake in a bar?

05:24.530 --> 05:26.860
Victoria, my Ducky.
I'm so sorry for-

05:26.910 --> 05:27.280
[whack]
Ahhh!

05:28.740 --> 05:30.620
This is your idea of helping
me with the arrangements?

05:30.660 --> 05:32.540
What the hell is my Dad doing
in a bar, Ned?

05:32.580 --> 05:34.160
That would be a no on clearing
it with the family.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.580
He's supposed to be at
the Funeral Home.

05:35.620 --> 05:37.120
Have you lost your mind?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.960
He used to watch soccer here.
Right here.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.090
Every Sunday with all of his
buddies. This is what he wanted!

05:44.130 --> 05:45.050
Trust me.

05:45.090 --> 05:46.720
[Jake] Hi. Hi there.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.470
Ignore him. He's a tool. Listen
to me. My name is Jake.

05:49.510 --> 05:52.100
I own the bar. Let's get
your father outta here.

05:52.140 --> 05:53.770
And back to the funeral home
where he belongs.

05:53.810 --> 05:55.730
You own this place? And you
allowed this?

05:56.810 --> 05:59.940
I'm gonna have both of you
arrested.

06:02.110 --> 06:03.940
I was gonna put the wedding
cake here.

06:05.110 --> 06:07.400
Jake please. This has to
happen right now.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.030
He's getting buried tomorrow.

06:09.070 --> 06:10.280
You get me arrested, Ned,
and I swear to God-

06:11.620 --> 06:13.620
We'll be talking about where
your wake is next.

06:14.660 --> 06:16.120
I have something to show you.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.040
Can I move this?

06:18.460 --> 06:19.420
Can I?

06:22.920 --> 06:24.010
What's he up to?

06:25.090 --> 06:26.420
Stealing tips now?

06:34.560 --> 06:37.520
Okay Buddy. You've had your
fun. Let's go.

06:37.560 --> 06:38.480
Come on.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.270
Excuse me?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.190
-I'm a guest here.
-For the funeral?

06:42.230 --> 06:44.780
Funeral? No. The wedding.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.280
My wedding?

06:48.320 --> 06:48.740
Ruby!

06:49.820 --> 06:51.370
Hey, I've been trying to call
you.

06:51.410 --> 06:51.660
What are you doing here?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.950
- Come here. Honey, how are you?
- You know this guy?

06:54.990 --> 06:57.210
Know me? Yeah. I'm her Dad.

06:59.920 --> 07:00.830
Carson Hickley.

07:00.880 --> 07:01.960
A.K.A.

07:02.000 --> 07:02.210
The deceased.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.630
Anyways. Carson owned a very
successful landscaping company.

07:06.670 --> 07:09.090
Now, he's got two kids.
Victoria, we already met.

07:09.130 --> 07:11.840
If you don't keep it up a notch,
I'm gonna have to take over.

07:11.890 --> 07:12.220
Victoria's a lot like

07:13.550 --> 07:14.680
her old man. She owns her
owns her own business.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.930
She's smart. Super sexy.

07:17.220 --> 07:19.560
She kinda had a bit of thing
for me, actually.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.440
Oh, my God.

07:21.980 --> 07:22.940
And-

07:23.770 --> 07:24.070
Trevor Hickley.

07:25.230 --> 07:27.360
Carson's son. As the photo
illustrates-

07:27.400 --> 07:29.820
He is a skeet bag who never got
along with his father.

07:29.860 --> 07:30.990
Good.

07:32.610 --> 07:34.240
Where is Trevor now?

07:34.280 --> 07:37.240
In jail. He went in about a
month ago for a B and E.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.160
Never even asked for a weekend
pass to go to the funeral.

07:40.210 --> 07:43.630
[Des] Okay. So, the brother is
in prison. So therefore -

07:43.670 --> 07:45.710
He can't even be accused
of foul play.

07:45.750 --> 07:46.050
So why bother bringing him up?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.050
'Cause he could got someone
else to do it.

07:49.090 --> 07:51.510
He's close with his cousins.
A bunch of sleeveens.

07:51.550 --> 07:53.470
Exactly. That's good. That's
good. Yes.

07:53.510 --> 07:54.600
- Stop that.
- Sorry.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.600
Do you have any actual
evidence at all?

07:58.640 --> 08:00.020
Me and Carson were
really close.

08:01.140 --> 08:03.980
Then he asked me to
witness his will.

08:04.020 --> 08:06.650
And then, all of a sudden he
drops dead of a

08:06.690 --> 08:08.070
supposed heart attack.

08:08.110 --> 08:09.400
Supposedly dies of
a heart attack.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.070
Bingo.

08:11.070 --> 08:13.400
Nobody can find
Carson's will.

08:13.450 --> 08:16.990
But I saw him lock it in a desk
drawer right after we were done.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.660
Okay. Who else had
access to the house?

08:19.700 --> 08:20.040
Immediate family.

08:21.580 --> 08:21.870
And the cousins who worked
for the landscaping business.

08:23.460 --> 08:26.710
Now, Carson planned to give
most of his estate to charity.

08:26.750 --> 08:27.960
And with no will-

08:28.000 --> 08:29.300
[Ned]
The money goes right to-

08:29.340 --> 08:30.420
The kids.

08:30.460 --> 08:30.720
[Ned]
Look Jake.

08:32.170 --> 08:32.470
I know I'm not the most
reliable fella in the world.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.640
But you gotta admit, there's
something wrong here.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.680
Do me a favour. Look into
Carson Hickley's financials.

08:37.720 --> 08:38.970
See if you can find anything.

08:39.010 --> 08:39.270
Okay.

08:40.810 --> 08:42.680
And if Dad doesn't kill me
first, maybe we can help you.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.350
But don't get your hopes up.

08:46.190 --> 08:48.110
You were with I. A.?
How did it go?

08:49.690 --> 08:49.980
Okay, I guess.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.740
It's Internal Affairs, Leslie.
They could bury you.

08:53.610 --> 08:55.070
Sorry. You know what I mean.

08:55.110 --> 08:56.410
They kept asking me questions

08:56.450 --> 08:57.620
about the murder
of Mayor Clarke.

08:57.660 --> 08:59.120
And my relationship with Jake.

08:59.160 --> 08:59.490
Why?

09:00.790 --> 09:01.160
They said they were going
through due process.

09:02.620 --> 09:05.080
I don't know. Something feels
wrong about all this.

09:05.120 --> 09:05.370
I'd stay away from Jake.

09:06.830 --> 09:09.380
Don't go giving them any fuel
that can get you burned.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.090
Sergeant.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.130
We still have no new leads on
that fugitive case.

09:15.180 --> 09:15.470
Right.

09:17.010 --> 09:19.100
Lucas LeDrew. Killed his wife
twenty years ago and fled.

09:19.140 --> 09:19.470
That' what he'd look like
today.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.810
A witness swears that
they saw him.

09:22.390 --> 09:23.600
Look into it.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.520
I'll see you at the wedding.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.310
Christian's wedding is today?

09:27.270 --> 09:29.070
Yeah. Uncle Jake
didn't tell you?

09:29.650 --> 09:31.020
No. He didn't.

09:31.070 --> 09:31.940
[message sound]

09:33.780 --> 09:34.070
That's Jake, isn't it?

09:35.360 --> 09:37.530
He's looking for info.
Probably about a case.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.990
He doesn't want you to get
in any more trouble.

09:43.830 --> 09:45.540
Don't worry.
I got this.

09:48.830 --> 09:50.590
[Christian] Why didn't you tell
me you Dad was coming?

09:50.630 --> 09:52.130
I didn't think he
could make it.

09:52.170 --> 09:53.460
Miss my daughter's wedding?

09:53.510 --> 09:54.670
Are you crazy?

09:55.840 --> 09:58.640
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Spencer.

09:58.680 --> 09:58.890
- Same here.
- I mean,

09:59.850 --> 10:01.350
you had me a bit
confused there.

10:01.390 --> 10:02.970
I thought you were
running out on your tab.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.310
And stealing tips.

10:04.350 --> 10:04.680
What? Oh.

10:06.190 --> 10:09.810
It's a wedding in a bar. I
assumed the drinks are free.

10:09.850 --> 10:11.520
Dad, can I see you privately
for a minute, please?

10:11.570 --> 10:11.820
Oh, sure hon.

10:13.110 --> 10:17.570
Listen. I brought you a little
something that -

10:17.610 --> 10:20.280
Well, this was your Mom's.

10:21.030 --> 10:22.410
Can I do the honours?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.450
-Not now.
-What?

10:25.200 --> 10:26.370
I think you should go.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.620
Alright. I'll go.

10:29.330 --> 10:30.210
Ruby.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.540
Ruby!

10:32.840 --> 10:35.300
Oh, what have I done?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.680
[Victoria] I hope you're
both happy.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.510
There's no room at the
funeral home now.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.930
-So we're stuck here.
-I'm sorry, my lover.

10:45.970 --> 10:46.310
Okay, look. It not ideal,

10:47.520 --> 10:47.810
but we'll look after
your crowd, alright?

10:49.060 --> 10:52.440
Is your brother planning on
attending today?

10:52.480 --> 10:52.940
Trevor, no.

10:54.190 --> 10:56.230
I got permission for him
to leave the prison.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.360
But he was too selfish.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.110
What a loser.

10:58.990 --> 10:59.240
Don't tell him I said that.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.620
That was meant
for behind his back.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.250
Ned mentioned
something about a will.

11:08.290 --> 11:08.620
There was no will.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.870
I searched my father's desk
and there was nothing there.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.500
Maybe someone took it before
they could find it.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.750
There was no will.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.130
Can you let that go?

11:16.170 --> 11:16.380
[Jake]
Okay. Calm down.

11:17.720 --> 11:21.340
Take it easy. I got a
wedding to prepare for.

11:26.430 --> 11:27.600
Drinking the good stuff.

11:28.430 --> 11:29.430
Hard day?

11:29.480 --> 11:30.600
Yeah, you could say that.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.770
Have another one. On me.

11:37.820 --> 11:40.070
The wake. That going
on all day?

11:40.110 --> 11:41.360
Hope not.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.540
Thanks for the drink.

11:55.000 --> 11:55.960
[Message sound]

11:59.670 --> 12:01.340
Rick. There's twenty
bucks there.

12:06.140 --> 12:06.390
What are you doing here?

12:07.470 --> 12:09.020
That's a heluva way
to greet a girl.

12:09.810 --> 12:11.140
How's the house arrest?

12:12.100 --> 12:13.100
And the wedding?

12:14.730 --> 12:16.520
Yeah, look. I was gonna tell
you about that.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.360
But I didn't because
I knew you'd come.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.940
Yeah, that's usually how
invitations work.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.820
Full of the charm
today, aren't ya?

12:27.160 --> 12:28.870
You really shouldn't be
here right now.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.120
You can't be around me.
I'm toxic.

12:33.460 --> 12:35.040
What's this about you calling
Tinny for info?

12:36.130 --> 12:37.170
What's the case
you're working on?

12:37.210 --> 12:38.420
It's not a case. Not really.

12:38.460 --> 12:39.340
No?

12:41.880 --> 12:43.090
Carson Hickley?

12:44.430 --> 12:46.680
Recently deceased. No record.

12:46.720 --> 12:49.640
But report of a domestic dispute
two months back at his house-

12:49.680 --> 12:52.180
between Carson and his
son Trevor.

12:52.230 --> 12:52.730
Really?

12:53.640 --> 12:53.980
Where there any charges laid?

12:55.150 --> 12:56.400
No, but it was called
in by Ned Bishop.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.150
- By Ned?
- Yeah. What's going on?

13:00.070 --> 13:01.990
Ned's holding Carson's
wake downstair.

13:02.030 --> 13:04.650
Because he thinks there's
foul play involved.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.240
He said that there's a will
gone missing.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.200
Although Carson's daughter,
Victoria denies

13:08.240 --> 13:09.910
there was ever
a missing will.

13:10.620 --> 13:11.910
That's interesting.

13:14.290 --> 13:15.790
Can you tell me some more
about that?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.630
No. Get out. I can't believe
I'm saying this. But get out.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.340
Get away from me.
Stay away from me.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.180
You look hot.
Oh my god, you look so hot.

13:28.220 --> 13:29.510
- I do, do I?
- You do.

13:31.220 --> 13:33.980
Okay. Your loss.

13:39.900 --> 13:41.480
[Christian] Look, this thing
with your dad.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.030
If you got something
to tell me.

13:43.070 --> 13:44.400
I think now is the time.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.030
It's complicated.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.950
I just wasn't expecting
to see him here.

13:47.990 --> 13:48.870
Yeah, I could tell.

13:49.910 --> 13:51.040
I should have told
you about him.

13:52.290 --> 13:55.540
After my mom passed,
we just drifted apart.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.580
He's never been the most
reliable father.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.710
Families are never simple.

14:04.840 --> 14:05.130
But I will say this-

14:06.680 --> 14:08.430
Nothing like a wedding for
bringing people back together.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.060
I'm so happy we're
doing this now.

14:14.430 --> 14:16.560
And if the bar thing's not
right, we can also wait.

14:17.520 --> 14:18.900
We got our whole
lives for this.

14:18.940 --> 14:20.270
You got cold feet?

14:21.360 --> 14:22.900
I want to do this. Do you?

14:24.780 --> 14:28.860
So. This was your mom's.

14:30.120 --> 14:30.990
Yeah.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.620
Well, I'll follow your lead.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.500
But don't you think she'd want
you to have this?

14:42.670 --> 14:44.260
[dinging]

14:45.710 --> 14:47.170
If I could have
your attention please.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.550
I'd like to say a few words.

14:48.590 --> 14:49.680
Ned, I gotta talk to you
for a second.

14:49.720 --> 14:50.010
- Not now.
- Right now.

14:51.050 --> 14:52.550
Carson Hickley was
a great fella.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.850
He was a hard worker. And he
really cared about people.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.940
He had a beautiful daughter,
Victoria. Charming.

15:00.730 --> 15:03.480
Kind hearted. Luscious.

15:03.520 --> 15:03.820
Come here.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.570
And a troubled jailbird son
who couldn't be here today.

15:08.610 --> 15:09.910
But his cousins are.

15:09.950 --> 15:10.240
Good to see you, fellas.

15:11.870 --> 15:15.950
Many of whom would come and go
at the Carson's place at will.

15:15.990 --> 15:18.000
- Speaking of which-
- I am warning you.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.830
You stop this.
There was no will!

15:19.870 --> 15:21.580
Let's just all remain calm.

15:22.670 --> 15:25.000
Sorry. But the truth
must be heard.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.010
And heard it shall be.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.970
Hey! Where are you going?

15:31.010 --> 15:33.050
I think Ruby's coming around.
We had a little chat.

15:33.090 --> 15:34.680
Yeah? Okay great.

15:36.180 --> 15:38.350
Whoa, whoa. What are you
doing, buddy? Watch it.

15:40.890 --> 15:41.850
You okay?

15:41.900 --> 15:42.230
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:43.690 --> 15:48.400
Listen, you tell Ruby I love
her, but that I gotta go.

15:48.440 --> 15:48.740
You're gonna break heart.

15:49.780 --> 15:50.610
I know she doesn't
want me here.

15:51.410 --> 15:51.990
Listen, you gotta stay.

15:53.030 --> 15:54.450
At least 'til after the
ceremony.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.490
I'm not gonna take no
for an answer.

15:59.960 --> 16:00.830
Ahh.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.750
You think my father left
you his money.

16:04.790 --> 16:06.500
Is that what
this is all about?

16:06.550 --> 16:06.840
No!

16:08.340 --> 16:11.050
Your father, Carson Hickley,
was killed over that will.

16:11.090 --> 16:13.470
And I believe that the
murderer is in this very room.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.300
Not to point any eyeballs.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.720
[Jake] Look at the size
of those cousins.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.520
Sorry, everyone.
Just shut up.

16:20.560 --> 16:20.890
Fine. I won't say a word.

16:22.230 --> 16:25.110
One more thing. Which
one of ye two killed him?

16:26.610 --> 16:27.480
Oof!

16:30.650 --> 16:31.530
Arrgh!

16:35.160 --> 16:36.030
[crack]

16:37.370 --> 16:39.200
[Jake]
Oh. Hey.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.790
I don't think that's
your father.

16:47.790 --> 16:50.300
Where is my
father's body, Ned?

16:50.340 --> 16:52.260
It's supposed to be right
here in this friggin' casket.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.630
This better not be a big
part of your plan.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.720
B'ys please. I'm not some
kind of a sicko, okay?

16:56.760 --> 16:58.930
I brought Carson's body straight
here from the funeral home.

16:58.970 --> 16:59.180
He's not there.

17:00.350 --> 17:01.390
Think about it.
First, a missing will.

17:01.430 --> 17:02.980
And now a missing body?

17:03.020 --> 17:04.270
Coincidence?
I think not.

17:04.310 --> 17:04.650
You think this is a game?

17:06.060 --> 17:07.860
This is my father's peace that
you're playing with.

17:07.900 --> 17:11.190
Look, Victoria. We will find
your father's body. Somehow.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.690
Okay. I'm gonna check with
the funeral home.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.030
And then I'm gonna
see my lawyer.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.110
And I am gonna sue you for
everything you have.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.530
No, no. You don't
need to do that.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.450
Joke's on her.

17:20.490 --> 17:21.120
I mean you're broke.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.080
Why didn't you tell me that you
filed a complaint to the police-

17:25.120 --> 17:27.580
that there was some kind of
altercation at Carson's house.

17:27.630 --> 17:28.500
How'd you know about that?

17:29.960 --> 17:30.250
I came home. I found stuff
thrown all over the place.

17:31.840 --> 17:35.260
Then Victoria's brother Trevor
was there yelling at Carson.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.180
Home?

17:37.430 --> 17:39.140
You were living at
Carson's house?

17:39.180 --> 17:41.390
I was technically
homeless at the time.

17:41.430 --> 17:43.520
And Carson said it's okay
if I could stay there.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.560
Good thing thing too.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.850
I probably saved his life.

17:47.060 --> 17:48.730
What was he fighting about
with his son?

17:49.270 --> 17:49.570
Not a clue.

17:50.690 --> 17:50.900
You better not be
lying to me, Ned.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.200
Go talk to the last person who
saw Carson in that box.

17:55.240 --> 17:55.530
Who?

17:56.530 --> 17:58.320
The fella driving
the hearse, Ned.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.530
That's a good idea.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.160
Hello.

18:04.200 --> 18:04.500
Do I even want to know?

18:05.620 --> 18:06.540
It doesn't really
matter right now.

18:06.580 --> 18:06.870
What are you doing here?

18:08.290 --> 18:09.830
We're canvassing the
neighbourhood for a fugitive.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.090
Lucas LeDrew.

18:11.710 --> 18:13.210
We've aged the photo. He's been
in hiding for twenty years.

18:13.250 --> 18:13.760
That's some scar.

18:14.920 --> 18:18.090
Is there a reward for
this gentleman?

18:18.130 --> 18:19.010
Don't you wish?

18:19.970 --> 18:21.470
I'll see you at the wedding.

18:21.510 --> 18:22.390
Okay.

18:23.010 --> 18:23.890
Jake.

18:25.980 --> 18:26.270
I didn't tell you this.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.600
But did you know that Leslie
is being investigated

18:29.650 --> 18:30.520
by Internal Affairs?

18:32.360 --> 18:33.610
It's because of me, isn't it?

18:34.360 --> 18:35.360
Conflict of interest.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.570
Tampering with a murder case.

18:38.490 --> 18:39.950
I thought you'd want to know.

18:41.030 --> 18:41.950
Thank you.

18:43.620 --> 18:44.870
[ring]

18:46.120 --> 18:48.120
I think this is called
mixed signals.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.540
Yeah. Why didn't you tell me
that you were being investigated

18:50.580 --> 18:50.880
by Internal Affairs?

18:52.420 --> 18:54.460
This is all my fault. I knew
that this was gonna happen.

18:54.500 --> 18:54.800
Jake. It's not your fault.

18:56.170 --> 18:57.880
I answered all their
questions. I told the truth.

18:57.920 --> 18:58.260
It will all go away now.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.800
So just, shut up and listen to
some info I got on our case.

19:02.850 --> 19:03.140
Our case?

19:04.140 --> 19:04.970
Carson died-
of a heart attack.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.850
And a request was made for a
autopsy

19:07.890 --> 19:09.350
by a close family friend.

19:09.390 --> 19:11.610
Let me guess. Ned Bishop.

19:12.480 --> 19:13.860
And now the body's missing.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.190
- What? - It doesn't matter.

19:15.230 --> 19:17.150
I'll tell you more when
I know more.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.570
For now, stay
away from me.

19:18.610 --> 19:18.820
Stay away from this case.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.570
Relax. Everything's
find on my end.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.160
I gotta go.

19:30.500 --> 19:30.710
What's all this?

19:32.000 --> 19:32.250
[Hood] I told you these
guys meant business.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.630
They're gonna
need your passwords too.

19:38.380 --> 19:38.800
Christian's turned into one of
them groomzillas.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.140
Apparently a dead body at his
wedding is one of his triggers.

19:43.180 --> 19:44.970
Carson's corpse goes missing.

19:46.890 --> 19:48.600
And you requested, and were
denied

19:48.640 --> 19:50.350
an autopsy report
with the police.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.440
I requested an autopsy because
somebody killed him.

19:53.480 --> 19:53.730
You know, I gotta say-

19:54.900 --> 19:57.110
This is all starting to sound
crazier

19:57.150 --> 19:57.400
and crazier by the
minute.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.030
Yeah? Well, I talked to the guys
who dropped the casket here.

20:01.070 --> 20:03.490
They told me that Carson's
body was definitely with them-

20:03.530 --> 20:03.870
when they left the
funeral home.

20:05.370 --> 20:05.990
They didn't take their eyes
off it, even for a second.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.160
Maybe for a couple of minutes
in the hearse.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.580
Because they had to
come up with a plan

20:10.620 --> 20:12.000
on how to navigate the
steps outside.

20:12.790 --> 20:13.000
Wait a minute.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.460
That's enough time for someone
to have taken the body.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.500
Ned.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.880
Carson Hickley was a
wealthy, wealthy man.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.880
Failed to point that
out, did you?

20:21.930 --> 20:22.220
No I didn't!

20:23.720 --> 20:24.970
His estimated net worth was
over five million dollars.

20:25.680 --> 20:26.760
Five million bucks.

20:26.800 --> 20:27.390
That's enough to murder over.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.180
He was planning to leave
it all to charity.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.230
Most of it.

20:31.270 --> 20:32.770
But if there was no will-

20:32.810 --> 20:34.150
The money automatically goes
to both

20:34.190 --> 20:35.520
Victoria and her
brother Trevor.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.060
The skeet who's in jail.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.020
And -This is crucial
information-

20:39.070 --> 20:40.400
I'm embarrassed to even
point this out, Ned.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.030
Victoria's bankrupt.

20:41.820 --> 20:42.070
- Bankrupt?
- Yeah.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.660
Which gives her a little thing
called "motive".

20:44.700 --> 20:46.530
To a little thing
called "murder".

20:46.570 --> 20:48.660
Or destroying a will, if you
weren't mentioned in it.

20:48.700 --> 20:48.990
Victoria?

20:50.250 --> 20:51.830
No, no. She's perfect.
She'd never do that.

20:53.580 --> 20:54.460
Des.

20:55.710 --> 20:57.340
Have you been wearing
foundation again?

20:58.380 --> 21:00.550
Are the bags under
my eyes back?

21:00.590 --> 21:01.630
Sorry.

21:07.760 --> 21:08.430
This is mortuary makeup.

21:09.850 --> 21:11.980
Buddy must have had his hands
all over the corpse.

21:12.020 --> 21:12.310
Who?

21:13.890 --> 21:16.020
Buddy. What was his name? The
fella who was here earlier?

21:16.060 --> 21:16.560
Doctor Gardner.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.650
Doctor? How do you know him?

21:18.690 --> 21:19.730
He's a bit of a regular.

21:19.770 --> 21:20.070
He's a dentist.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.030
Why would someone be fooling
around with a body?

21:23.070 --> 21:23.360
Actually, I don't want
to know that.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.570
Des, I think it's time that
you go for a little cleaning.

21:26.610 --> 21:28.370
What?
Again with this?

21:28.410 --> 21:31.080
I live in a storage
room above a bar.

21:32.290 --> 21:34.830
Look at my life. Just
cut me some slack.

21:34.870 --> 21:36.920
You're teeth, b'y.
Your teeth. Your teet.

21:36.960 --> 21:37.250
What?

21:38.630 --> 21:39.840
Go see the dentist. See if
you can find anything.

21:39.880 --> 21:40.210
- And be careful.
- Okay.

21:41.380 --> 21:42.380
This is the worst
wedding-funeral ever.

21:43.880 --> 21:44.130
You doing this in protest?

21:45.590 --> 21:46.890
You don't want to see me
happy, so you ruin my wedding?

21:46.930 --> 21:47.140
Yes b'y.

21:48.010 --> 21:49.100
Get that casket outta here.

21:49.140 --> 21:49.350
I can't get rid of the casket.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.890
If they find the body, the cops
are gonna want to look at it.

21:52.930 --> 21:55.430
Plus- Buddy's daughter is
threatening to sue me.

21:55.480 --> 21:55.770
You know, Ruby
really loves me.

21:57.060 --> 21:58.730
But I think that a wake at the
wedding might

21:58.770 --> 22:00.110
just scare her off.

22:00.150 --> 22:01.110
Maybe this is a sign.

22:01.900 --> 22:02.190
I mean, think about it.

22:03.650 --> 22:05.110
Do you really know this woman
that you're marrying?

22:05.150 --> 22:07.030
Or the family that you're
marrying into?

22:07.070 --> 22:08.620
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

22:08.660 --> 22:08.910
Be a good brother.

22:09.990 --> 22:11.200
Focus on getting rid of
that wake.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.410
[crash]

22:15.540 --> 22:17.000
Is that your future
father-in-law

22:17.870 --> 22:19.580
over there smashing glasses?

22:21.590 --> 22:22.710
Shut up.

22:27.010 --> 22:29.090
[Rose] You're gonna
look so beautiful.

22:29.760 --> 22:30.720
[Sloan]
Yeah.

22:31.390 --> 22:33.140
Very wedding like.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.680
I'm not sure how I feel about
my dad being here.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.480
You two have bad blood?

22:38.520 --> 22:40.060
After my mom died, we moved
around a lot.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.480
Spencer could never hold down
a steady job.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.070
That couldn't have been
easy.

22:45.110 --> 22:47.070
I bet you had to pick
up the slack a lot.

22:47.110 --> 22:47.240
I know I had to.

22:48.780 --> 22:50.950
Yeah, I would work part time as
a cashier after school.

22:51.570 --> 22:51.870
Other odd jobs.

22:53.410 --> 22:55.290
Doesn't leave time for friends
or a normal life, does it?

22:56.660 --> 22:57.960
Everything will be fine.

22:58.000 --> 22:58.540
I just wasn't expecting
to see him.

22:59.960 --> 23:03.170
I guess we have some issues
we need to work through.

23:04.750 --> 23:08.220
Oh. That must have cost
a few dollars.

23:10.220 --> 23:11.180
It was my mother's.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.480
Oh it's a classic.
Really pretty.

23:23.190 --> 23:23.900
Hello.

23:24.770 --> 23:27.190
Any one at home? Or work or-

23:28.780 --> 23:31.660
Sorry. We're closed. You'll
have to come back later.

23:31.700 --> 23:37.250
Oh. I'm sorry. Doctor, mister
dentist-man.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.040
I don't think-
This can't wait.

23:39.080 --> 23:42.080
I got this funny thing going
on in the back of my jaw.

23:42.120 --> 23:45.540
I think it might be ingrown. But
nothing needs to be drilled or

23:45.590 --> 23:47.340
a needle or
anything like that.

23:47.380 --> 23:47.670
You got another patient there?

23:48.920 --> 23:49.380
It might be something
that's going around.

23:50.550 --> 23:53.890
Well, I guess you leave
me no choice.

23:55.970 --> 23:57.430
[Christian] You wanna tell me
what's going on?

23:57.470 --> 23:57.640
Old friend.

23:58.810 --> 24:00.730
Easily excitable
Nothing to worry about.

24:00.770 --> 24:01.060
Spencer.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.060
I come from a family of cops
and P.I.s. So-

24:05.690 --> 24:08.690
I tend to know when something's
not on the up and up, you know?

24:10.150 --> 24:13.030
Well, I owe the guy
twenty grand.

24:13.070 --> 24:15.120
He says if I don't get
it to him today-

24:15.160 --> 24:17.330
that I'm finished.

24:17.370 --> 24:17.700
What?

24:18.950 --> 24:23.370
Son. I got my vices.
I'm a gambler-a-holic.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.130
Or whatever the hell
you wanna call it.

24:26.170 --> 24:27.300
And the thought of
seeing Ruby-

24:28.000 --> 24:28.630
Made me so nervous-

24:30.260 --> 24:31.760
Look, you lost at cards. That's
not a problem we can't fix.

24:33.380 --> 24:38.060
Well, I think I'd better get out
of town until after the wedding.

24:38.100 --> 24:40.810
Unless I could borrow
some money from you.

24:44.020 --> 24:45.900
[Leslie] You're gonna look some
sharp for the wedding.

24:45.940 --> 24:47.690
Rose wanted me to
get a new suit.

24:47.730 --> 24:49.900
Shag all wrong
with the old one.

24:49.940 --> 24:51.070
Must be exciting.

24:51.110 --> 24:52.860
Getting more so by the minute.

24:52.900 --> 24:54.240
To what do I owe the pleasure?

24:54.280 --> 24:54.570
You looking for Jake?

24:55.950 --> 24:56.740
I wanted to ask your advice
on a police matter.

24:58.030 --> 25:01.250
It's both personal and
professional, actually

25:01.290 --> 25:02.580
What's on your mind?

25:05.500 --> 25:07.670
It seems Internal Affairs has
taken an interest in me.

25:07.710 --> 25:08.790
I can guess why.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.130
My job could be on the line.

25:10.670 --> 25:13.340
Jake was responsible for you
being suspended once before.

25:13.380 --> 25:15.840
I don't think he'd want to
see it happen again.

25:15.890 --> 25:16.970
Yeah, but it's different
this time.

25:17.890 --> 25:19.600
I don't think I care anymore.

25:19.640 --> 25:20.970
About the job, I mean.
Not your son.

25:22.480 --> 25:25.140
Unfortunately, it's more than
just your job at stake.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.400
If those guys find anything
they can use against you-

25:27.440 --> 25:29.320
You're looking at some
serious jail time.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.440
What do I do? I just back off?

25:31.480 --> 25:33.860
And let Jake go down for a
murder he didn't commit?

25:33.900 --> 25:35.360
No. Not that anyone would
blame you.

25:36.610 --> 25:39.490
Leslie. We're all working
on this with Jake.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.910
We'll prove his innocence.

25:41.950 --> 25:44.370
As for you. You can't
risk going to jail-

25:44.410 --> 25:46.290
trying to keep
Jake out of one.

25:51.500 --> 25:52.800
- Thanks Mal.
- Hey.

26:02.770 --> 26:03.390
What is it?

26:03.980 --> 26:04.850
Ruby's lying.

26:08.940 --> 26:10.520
Have you been drinking?

26:11.940 --> 26:13.690
Stay still. No talking.

26:16.320 --> 26:19.740
Oh my. That's not good.

26:19.780 --> 26:20.120
What's not good?

26:21.280 --> 26:22.620
It's lucky you came to me
when you did.

26:22.660 --> 26:23.660
It is?

26:23.700 --> 26:25.250
It's a very bad abscess.

26:25.290 --> 26:25.620
We'll have to take care
of it right away.

26:27.080 --> 26:30.920
What? No. I think it's gone.
I think whatever you did-

26:30.960 --> 26:33.420
You just count
back from ten for me.

26:33.460 --> 26:37.630
[muffled] Ten, nine, eight...

26:43.470 --> 26:44.560
What the hell happened here?

26:44.970 --> 26:46.020
Hello?

26:46.060 --> 26:47.390
- Victoria.
- [bang]

26:55.440 --> 26:58.660
Thanks. But Des does
all my ironing.

26:59.780 --> 27:02.030
[Victoria] Where's my
father's body?

27:03.080 --> 27:04.830
I'm just trying to
figure that out.

27:04.870 --> 27:07.370
Are you and Ned in this
together for my dad's money?

27:07.410 --> 27:08.660
Are you investigating me?

27:08.710 --> 27:09.000
What is going on?

27:10.330 --> 27:12.000
I'm trying to figure out
everything you just said.

27:12.040 --> 27:15.130
I'm sorry. I don't even know
what the hell I'm doing.

27:15.170 --> 27:16.590
I'm so sorry. I just-

27:17.590 --> 27:18.470
Sorry.

27:20.970 --> 27:22.260
Am I bleeding?

27:22.850 --> 27:23.850
A little bit.

27:23.890 --> 27:24.760
Sorry.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.560
I know you're bankrupt,
by the way.

27:29.600 --> 27:29.940
I made one bad decision.

27:31.190 --> 27:33.520
And lost everything I
worked so hard for.

27:33.560 --> 27:34.480
I'm gonna lose my house.

27:35.980 --> 27:37.990
Did anyone else in your family
know anything about that?

27:38.030 --> 27:39.240
You're poor decision making?

27:39.280 --> 27:39.990
Just my brother.

27:41.280 --> 27:43.870
I couldn't tell my dad.
He'd be so disappointed.

27:44.950 --> 27:45.450
Before your brother
went to jail-

27:47.040 --> 27:49.960
Him and your father, they got in
some big fight, didn't they?

27:50.000 --> 27:50.290
What was that all about?

27:51.420 --> 27:52.210
Dad was acting
weird before he died.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.380
He developed this temper.

27:55.710 --> 27:58.010
My brother was just trying to
calm things down.

27:58.050 --> 28:00.050
And it just got heated and-

28:02.300 --> 28:03.470
That's all.

28:04.510 --> 28:05.390
It'll be okay.

28:06.010 --> 28:08.140
It'll be okay -

28:09.310 --> 28:09.600
[Leslie]
Now you-

28:10.640 --> 28:12.480
Really are sending
mixed signals.

28:13.230 --> 28:13.770
[Ned]
Jake.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.940
What are you doing?

28:15.980 --> 28:16.440
Sleaze much?

28:17.780 --> 28:19.990
Come on, my ducky.
Let's get a drink into you.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.370
Don't even think about
telling me to leave.

28:26.410 --> 28:27.540
No, no.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.080
She had an iron. I walked-

28:30.160 --> 28:32.960
Yeah, I don't care.
I don't care.

28:55.810 --> 28:58.400
Hey. Hey buddy.
Can you untie me?

28:59.150 --> 29:01.650
Hey! Hey. Wakie wakie!

29:05.200 --> 29:08.490
Oh my god it's Carson
Hickley. The dead body.

29:08.530 --> 29:10.250
Oh my god! It's a dead body.

29:11.000 --> 29:11.870
Arrgh!

29:17.960 --> 29:21.300
I need to take a loan out
against my share of the bar.

29:21.340 --> 29:24.590
Something tells me it's not to
cover Des's decoration expenses.

29:24.630 --> 29:27.100
It's for Spencer.
He needs cash.

29:27.140 --> 29:27.510
Son.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.470
There's something
we need to tell you.

29:33.060 --> 29:34.140
This looks like
Ruby's necklace.

29:35.270 --> 29:36.400
I noticed the
designer stamp. "DD".

29:37.650 --> 29:39.360
It's from Diamond
Design right here in town.

29:40.610 --> 29:42.900
It's impossible. She
said it was her mom's.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.660
And then, there's this.

29:49.660 --> 29:51.080
Ruby and her dad?
They both have-

29:51.120 --> 29:51.330
criminal records?

29:52.250 --> 29:52.790
Ruby spent some time in Juvie.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.540
But it's Spencer
I'd worry about.

29:55.580 --> 29:57.080
That's a pretty
impressive rap sheet.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.130
Ruby's been playing me?

29:59.290 --> 30:00.920
That can't be right.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.340
Well, Spencer sure has.

30:02.380 --> 30:03.670
Ruby knows
we're all broke. So-

30:03.710 --> 30:04.840
What could she want from us?

30:04.880 --> 30:05.220
Look, let's focus.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.340
Before we accuse your bride to
be of being on the grift.

30:09.390 --> 30:11.510
Why would she lie to me about
this necklace being her mom's-

30:11.560 --> 30:12.770
If she wasn't playing me?

30:15.350 --> 30:16.230
Son!

30:22.520 --> 30:24.570
Why won't this program
accept my changes?

30:35.450 --> 30:37.790
[Des]
You're him. You're him!

30:37.830 --> 30:38.120
You're
Lucas LeDrew.

30:39.710 --> 30:42.040
You've been living here for
years as this Dr. Gardner guy.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.380
When really you were this
LeDrew fella the whole time.

30:44.420 --> 30:46.760
Just calm down kid.
This will all be over-

30:46.800 --> 30:48.010
As soon as I can switch
the dental records.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.430
You won't be able to
do it that way.

30:50.470 --> 30:53.010
You're gonna have to
do it manually.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.100
With the coding.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.640
And I can help with that.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.730
Okay. Then do it.

31:02.940 --> 31:05.320
My hands are tied up.

31:07.570 --> 31:07.900
Thanks.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.530
Okay. So I got an APB out
on the missing body.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.280
So you think that Carson
Hickley was murdered.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.620
According to the blood work
from a few weeks back,

31:15.660 --> 31:15.870
there were high levels-

31:16.790 --> 31:18.000
of mercury in Carson's system.

31:19.370 --> 31:20.250
Mercury.

31:21.540 --> 31:22.460
So he was poisoned.

31:23.750 --> 31:25.960
There's no shortage of motive
to go around.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.800
We know that Carson was a huge
philanthropist, right?

31:29.680 --> 31:29.930
So possibly he was planning

31:31.140 --> 31:33.510
on donating half of his
money to charity.

31:33.550 --> 31:35.760
But without the will that Ned
claims exists-

31:35.810 --> 31:38.140
All the money is gonna go to
Victoria and her brother.

31:38.180 --> 31:40.270
Her brother was living
with Carson.

31:40.310 --> 31:40.520
And that would give him the
opportunity-

31:41.810 --> 31:43.860
to administer the poison
before he went to jail.

31:43.900 --> 31:46.820
And we both know he
and a trouble past.

31:46.860 --> 31:49.950
Victoria's bankrupt. I know
she needs the cash. But-

31:51.110 --> 31:53.030
There's just
something about her.

31:53.070 --> 31:54.450
The way that she talks
about her father.

31:54.490 --> 31:54.830
You could tell that she
loved him.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.080
And she's insanely protective
over her brother.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.540
- None of this adds up.
- [phone buzz]

32:02.170 --> 32:03.630
What's going on?

32:03.670 --> 32:06.130
A text message from a
dentist's office.

32:06.170 --> 32:08.380
Dr Gardner is LeDrew.

32:17.430 --> 32:18.980
Dr. Gardner is a murderer.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.100
And I sent Des right to him.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.560
No, no, no you don't.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.400
Des is in trouble.
I gotta help him.

32:25.270 --> 32:26.520
Let me see that ankle.

32:26.570 --> 32:27.610
Come on.

32:27.650 --> 32:28.530
Oh.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.410
Honey. I know we're not the
most traditional couple.

32:36.450 --> 32:37.740
But, I at least wanted my
dress to be a surprise.

32:38.830 --> 32:39.790
Like everything else
in your life.

32:40.660 --> 32:41.620
What are you talking about?

32:41.660 --> 32:41.960
You lied to me.

32:43.290 --> 32:44.880
About you and your father.
I saw your records.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.630
Have you been checking
up on me?

32:47.670 --> 32:49.260
Look, don't
change the subject.

32:50.710 --> 32:52.880
Are you running a con on
me and my family?

32:59.430 --> 33:00.390
Spencer and I -

33:01.140 --> 33:02.730
We used to run scams.

33:02.770 --> 33:04.230
When I was a kid.

33:04.270 --> 33:06.060
But I would
never do that to you.

33:06.100 --> 33:06.440
How can you even ask me that?

33:07.730 --> 33:09.150
He just asked me for twenty
thousand dollars.

33:09.190 --> 33:09.690
What?

33:10.860 --> 33:12.490
I was worried he was up
to something.

33:13.570 --> 33:14.820
I used to give him money
whenever he

33:14.860 --> 33:15.110
got himself
into trouble.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.160
That's why I cut
him out of my life.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.240
Stop with the lies.

33:18.280 --> 33:20.200
Look. This necklace.

33:20.240 --> 33:20.910
Used to be your moms,
you said. Yeah?

33:22.410 --> 33:24.460
I don't even know how this
fits into your little grift.

33:25.330 --> 33:25.630
I know this is no heirloom.

33:26.880 --> 33:27.170
I wanted to tell you it wasn't
my mother's.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.170
But then I'd have to tell you
about my father and my past.

33:30.210 --> 33:31.090
We're done.

33:32.170 --> 33:33.800
Get your stuff
together and leave.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.720
Without taking anything
else from my family.

33:37.760 --> 33:38.850
If you don't mind.

33:49.820 --> 33:50.530
[LeDrew]
Did you do it yet?

33:51.400 --> 33:53.570
Yeah.
Sort of, actually.

33:53.610 --> 33:54.530
'Cause I'm gonna need-

33:55.820 --> 33:57.700
special software program to
save the changes.

33:57.740 --> 33:59.990
Otherwise, it's gonna keep
reverting back

34:00.030 --> 34:00.330
every time you
refresh the page.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.660
You better solve it. Or you're
going under for good.

34:06.250 --> 34:07.330
What are you doing?

34:07.380 --> 34:08.420
Shut up.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.300
Shut up and figure it out.

34:16.840 --> 34:19.300
[phone rings]

34:20.890 --> 34:21.220
Hello.

34:22.430 --> 34:24.930
Christian. Buddy? I
need that money now.

34:24.970 --> 34:28.020
Good luck. I know you and your
daughter are playing me.

34:28.060 --> 34:29.610
What? You don't understand.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.780
Give us the money or Spencer
is a dead man.

34:33.990 --> 34:35.570
You are determined.
I'll give you that.

34:36.740 --> 34:38.990
Look, have a nice life,
alright? Or not.

34:44.450 --> 34:45.370
Des!

34:54.960 --> 34:56.470
Looks like we found our
missing corpse.

34:57.510 --> 34:59.340
LeDrew must have taken Des.
Why?

34:59.390 --> 35:00.640
Jake, you gotta go.

35:00.680 --> 35:01.600
I gotta call this in.

35:02.510 --> 35:02.760
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

35:04.350 --> 35:07.980
These are dental records for
Carson Hickley and Lucas LeDrew.

35:08.020 --> 35:09.850
Is LeDrew trying to fake
his own death?

35:09.890 --> 35:12.730
I mean, that could be why he's
flipping the dental records.

35:12.770 --> 35:13.650
It looks like he
couldn't finish it.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.240
Des is a wizard at this stuff.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.780
Unless he needed his own
software to finish it.

35:19.820 --> 35:20.740
I know where they are.

35:20.780 --> 35:21.070
Wait, Jake.

35:22.660 --> 35:24.790
For LeDrew's plan to work, he'd
have to destroy Carson's body.

35:27.040 --> 35:27.910
You hear that?

35:29.460 --> 35:30.710
Those tanks are leaking.

35:31.710 --> 35:33.290
There's no way to
shut them off.

35:35.670 --> 35:36.760
Is he gonna torch this place?

35:36.800 --> 35:37.800
Where's the fuse?

35:41.090 --> 35:41.970
Jake.

35:45.810 --> 35:46.720
It's nitroglycerine.

35:47.730 --> 35:50.100
Um. Is it just me?
Or is there-

35:50.140 --> 35:51.480
a bunch of liquid
in that lightbulb?

35:52.230 --> 35:53.650
It's highly volatile.

35:54.940 --> 35:56.030
Oh oh.

35:57.070 --> 35:58.360
There's a timer-

35:58.400 --> 35:59.700
On the friggin' lights.

35:59.740 --> 36:01.240
We gotta get that outta there.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.200
Nice and easy.

36:07.240 --> 36:07.450
Hurry, okay.

36:08.450 --> 36:08.660
Now who's sending mixed
signals?

36:09.580 --> 36:10.000
You're kind of distracting me.

36:11.330 --> 36:13.880
- Just be careful.
- Keep an eye on the clock!

36:13.920 --> 36:17.760
Five, four, three, two-

36:25.100 --> 36:26.510
That woulda been
some light bill.

36:30.230 --> 36:30.520
[Christian] I can't believe she
played me, Dad.

36:32.140 --> 36:34.650
Christian, there's a lot more
going on here than it appears.

36:35.230 --> 36:36.270
I can feel it.

36:42.650 --> 36:45.070
I got all my stuff. So-

36:46.530 --> 36:47.950
I guess this is goodbye.

36:49.580 --> 36:50.500
I guess so.

36:51.540 --> 36:55.880
Oh. Here.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.550
I know you don't believe this-
But why would I steal from you?

37:02.590 --> 37:04.800
You have nothing.
But I don't care.

37:05.430 --> 37:06.640
I still love you.

37:07.930 --> 37:09.930
But there's nothing I can say
to convince you.

37:12.100 --> 37:14.730
Son, think about this. I
believe she loves you.

37:14.770 --> 37:15.900
Do you love her?

37:17.730 --> 37:18.770
Hey, Ruby.

37:18.820 --> 37:19.480
Yes?

37:20.530 --> 37:22.320
Your dad's
kidnapper just called.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.200
So you might want to tell
him I'm on to you.

37:24.240 --> 37:24.530
Smooth son.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.870
Dad's never used kidnappers.

37:26.910 --> 37:28.160
See, this is a code.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.870
Christian.
She's being serious.

37:29.910 --> 37:31.160
I have to find him.

37:32.910 --> 37:33.750
Okay Ruby.

37:34.660 --> 37:36.580
Let's find out
what's going on.

37:38.840 --> 37:39.800
Hurry up. Hurry up!

37:39.840 --> 37:40.800
Okay.

37:43.220 --> 37:44.550
And done.

37:44.590 --> 37:45.930
Nice work.

37:49.560 --> 37:49.760
Drop the knife.

37:51.060 --> 37:54.640
It's over, Gardner.
Or should I say LeDrew?

37:57.020 --> 37:58.440
- Des!
- I got him.

38:02.070 --> 38:03.570
Hey, that's my
fathers's jacket!

38:03.610 --> 38:04.820
Give that to me!

38:04.860 --> 38:06.070
Just take it easy.

38:07.030 --> 38:08.740
What the hell is
going on here?

38:08.780 --> 38:09.830
[kidnapper]
Where's my money?

38:09.870 --> 38:10.780
Dad!

38:10.830 --> 38:11.740
Sorry honey.

38:11.790 --> 38:12.040
Look. It wasn't a scam.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.040
I borrowed that money to
buy that necklace.

38:15.080 --> 38:17.330
And then I told you
it was your mom's.

38:17.370 --> 38:19.040
Because I was just hoping that
you'd accept it.

38:19.840 --> 38:20.880
Hey! Not me. Take Jake.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.880
You know what? Let's just deal
with one psychopath at a time.

38:25.920 --> 38:28.470
Okay? Now listen. I know you
want to get outta here.

38:28.510 --> 38:30.470
But the place is crawling with
cops. So listen.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.140
Take this coat.

38:33.180 --> 38:34.810
And use it to cover yourself
up, alright?

38:34.850 --> 38:35.980
Now go. Go!

38:38.650 --> 38:40.190
Now, let me guess.

38:40.980 --> 38:42.400
Spencer owes you money?

38:45.740 --> 38:47.110
Just take this and go.

38:47.780 --> 38:49.030
That's not enough.

38:49.740 --> 38:50.570
Alright.

38:51.160 --> 38:51.410
Take this too.

38:52.490 --> 38:53.660
Christian. You don't
have to do that.

38:53.700 --> 38:54.790
This is our debt.

38:55.950 --> 38:58.080
Man, that is a beautiful ring.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.670
Spencer, give him the ring.

39:01.380 --> 39:02.250
[punch]

39:03.170 --> 39:04.050
Magic.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.260
Honey.
I'm so sorry.

39:07.300 --> 39:08.050
It's okay, Dad.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.930
Ruby. I'm an idiot.

39:12.140 --> 39:14.100
[Mal] Does that meed the
wedding's back on?

39:14.140 --> 39:15.220
[Christian]
If she'll have me.

39:18.980 --> 39:20.940
Jake.
Did LeDrew get away?

39:20.980 --> 39:22.360
Yeah, but he's not gonna get
far.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.530
I put my ankle bracelet
in his coat.

39:26.780 --> 39:28.400
- Victoria, do you mind if I-
- Hey!

39:29.570 --> 39:30.870
Have a look at this?

39:33.990 --> 39:34.200
What's that?

39:35.540 --> 39:37.460
The last will and testament of
Carson Hickley.

39:38.660 --> 39:40.620
- How did it get in there?
- Good question.

39:40.670 --> 39:42.840
Why don't you ask your little
girlfriend there?

39:44.090 --> 39:45.300
It says here-

39:47.760 --> 39:49.720
That Carson left Victoria
everything.

39:55.220 --> 39:57.060
[Jake] So you do you
wanna explain-

39:57.100 --> 39:59.180
Why you hid your
father's will?

39:59.230 --> 40:01.150
Especially when it names
you as the soul heir.

40:02.310 --> 40:02.860
I love my brother.

40:04.060 --> 40:06.020
He and my father didn't
get along very well.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.530
And if this will was read, it
would just hurt Trevor more.

40:08.570 --> 40:10.320
And then he would never take
any money from me,

40:10.360 --> 40:12.200
knowing that it wasn't my
father's intention.

40:12.910 --> 40:14.070
The will disappears.

40:15.450 --> 40:16.830
And then you split everything
with your brother.

40:16.870 --> 40:18.540
And he never knows
the difference.

40:18.580 --> 40:20.040
Why was it in his coat?

40:20.790 --> 40:21.080
I couldn't destroy it.

40:22.630 --> 40:23.960
I just figured it would be
better if it stayed with Dad.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.170
I guess I have to take this
to the lawyers now.

40:27.210 --> 40:29.260
Well, not necessarily. I don't
really

40:29.300 --> 40:30.720
see a will around
here, do you?

40:31.510 --> 40:32.760
- No.
- Ned?

40:32.800 --> 40:34.430
B'ys, it's right there, look!

40:34.470 --> 40:35.390
Ned.

40:35.430 --> 40:38.930
Oh, no. There's no will.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.060
Thanks Ned.

40:42.060 --> 40:44.560
What about the mercury in my
father's system?

40:44.600 --> 40:46.110
I think I can answer that.

40:46.820 --> 40:48.150
Believe it or not.

40:48.190 --> 40:48.530
Dental records show
your dad had

40:49.990 --> 40:52.360
a number of mercury fillings
that began to break down.

40:52.990 --> 40:53.200
Didn't kill him.

40:54.450 --> 40:55.780
But it would explain those
trace elements.

40:56.660 --> 40:58.030
It could also explain why he

40:58.080 --> 40:59.620
might have been acting a
little off-

41:00.370 --> 41:00.660
Before he passed away.

41:01.750 --> 41:04.960
And- we got LeDrew,
thanks to you.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.250
So, you think it means-

41:07.290 --> 41:09.710
It means you might have a shot
at getting out of house arrest.

41:09.760 --> 41:10.300
Yes, b'y.

41:11.050 --> 41:13.930
Body and casket removed.

41:13.970 --> 41:16.430
Ned did alright.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.180
That means we're ready.
Let's go. Come on.

41:29.820 --> 41:30.820
Wow.

41:31.860 --> 41:32.900
Who-?

41:38.280 --> 41:39.700
Des. Did you do all this?

41:39.740 --> 41:40.080
It's beautiful.

41:41.580 --> 41:43.410
Well, weddings are easier
without a corpse. Here you go.

41:43.460 --> 41:44.870
They usually are, Dessy.

41:45.370 --> 41:46.580
Come here.

41:46.630 --> 41:47.960
Can't take you nowhere.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.630
Nice new suit there, Malachy.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.970
Look a lot like the old one.

41:57.010 --> 41:58.760
I knew that gravy stain
would come out.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.760
Maybe we should renew our vows.
What do you think?

42:00.810 --> 42:02.060
No more weddings.

42:02.810 --> 42:05.230
Hey. Best Man.

42:05.890 --> 42:06.810
Let's go, brother.

42:18.780 --> 42:21.830
Uh, Who's gonna marry you
guys, anyway?

42:21.870 --> 42:23.620
[Des]
This is my favourite part.

42:25.580 --> 42:27.670
He applied on line to be
the officiant.

42:37.180 --> 42:38.130
Alright.

42:38.180 --> 42:40.260
Dear family and friends.

42:41.930 --> 42:45.060
B'ys I look around and see
that we're all family. So-

42:45.680 --> 42:46.940
So as a family,

42:48.100 --> 42:50.940
we gather here to witness
the loving union

42:50.980 --> 42:53.530
of Christian Doyle and
Ruby Renette.

42:54.110 --> 42:55.030
In matrimony.
