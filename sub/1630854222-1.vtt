02:36.458 --> 02:37.796
Thomas?

02:37.931 --> 02:40.364
Hm-hmm?

02:40.500 --> 02:44.067
I've decided I'm
going on a holiday.

02:44.203 --> 02:47.838
What!?
Where?

02:47.974 --> 02:49.166
Sydney.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.877
Why?

02:52.012 --> 02:53.273
I need a break.

02:53.409 --> 02:55.616
A break?

02:55.751 --> 02:57.212
From what?

02:57.348 --> 02:59.313
A break from you Thomas.

03:04.090 --> 03:05.484
Who the hell?

03:05.619 --> 03:07.327
Can you answer it?

03:15.770 --> 03:17.667
Hang on!

03:28.312 --> 03:30.075
Hello Thomas.

03:43.656 --> 03:47.367
Thomas? Tom?

03:50.634 --> 03:52.900
-Who are you?
-Get back.

03:56.371 --> 03:57.736
Move.

03:57.872 --> 04:00.113
I have money. I can pay you...

04:17.825 --> 04:20.664
Ryker wants us out by 2300.

04:21.497 --> 04:24.195
Let's get it done.

04:57.634 --> 04:59.936
It's your daily wake-up service.

05:00.072 --> 05:01.903
Morning.

05:09.414 --> 05:11.443
How are you feeling?

05:11.578 --> 05:13.047
Tired.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.888
Yeah, and now you're ready
for the tournament right?

05:17.323 --> 05:19.450
Yeah, I'll be fine.

05:19.586 --> 05:23.524
Dad's coming to support me
seeing as you can't make it.

05:23.660 --> 05:25.663
Yeah I know, I'm sorry.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.394
Shall I wake up Sarah?

05:31.530 --> 05:35.533
Ah no don't. She said she
doesn't want to come.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.235
Really?

05:37.803 --> 05:39.743
Hm-hmm.

05:41.714 --> 05:44.451
I don't know what
to do with her Ash.

05:46.119 --> 05:50.186
Well we're going on a weekend
away so maybe that will help.

05:50.321 --> 05:53.625
Yeah maybe.

05:53.761 --> 05:56.991
I'll try and get her into
the psych this afternoon.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.324
Do you want to come?

06:01.368 --> 06:03.360
I can't. I've got work.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.840
Yep.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.541
No, that's fine.

07:20.979 --> 07:24.585
I know she's talented,
but you're better.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.049
I don't know Dad. I barely
made it into the finals.

07:27.184 --> 07:32.323
You can do this. Remember,
have courage, take risks.

07:32.459 --> 07:33.926
The prize is within reach.

07:34.061 --> 07:38.129
Exactly. It's that mantra that
helped me win a world title.

07:38.264 --> 07:40.160
You can too.

07:42.928 --> 07:44.463
Thanks Dad.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.714
Nine to Liz Knight.

08:24.512 --> 08:27.075
Nine for Matthews.

08:38.550 --> 08:42.486
Eye of the storm.
Ten for Liz Knight.

08:57.739 --> 08:58.843
Ten.

08:58.978 --> 09:02.209
Matthews scores ten
with her second arrow.

09:12.927 --> 09:18.456
Nine.
That's 28 out of 30 for Knight.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.790
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:20.926 --> 09:25.331
It's time for Kate Matthews
to see if she can beat 28.

09:41.047 --> 09:42.546
Forgive me.

10:08.249 --> 10:09.806
Well done.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.911
Thanks. Hey I was bound to
beat you eventually, right?

10:13.047 --> 10:14.721
You're so good now.

10:14.856 --> 10:16.853
Oh, I think you were
off your game today.

10:16.989 --> 10:20.694
Go celebrate. You won!

10:24.491 --> 10:27.567
Second place is still
pretty damn good.

10:27.703 --> 10:30.235
I sucked.
I can't seem to concentrate.

10:30.370 --> 10:32.233
Oh really?

10:33.265 --> 10:35.269
How's things with Ash?

10:37.369 --> 10:39.411
We're trying to work it out.

10:39.546 --> 10:40.604
We're going down south

10:40.739 --> 10:42.742
for a short holiday
with Sarah tomorrow.

10:42.877 --> 10:45.618
Sounds nice.

10:45.754 --> 10:47.311
Why don't you come down
on Sunday?

10:47.446 --> 10:50.988
I'll see.
I've got a lot on.

11:04.767 --> 11:06.570
Everything okay?

11:06.705 --> 11:09.204
She wants to see you.

11:11.241 --> 11:13.945
Do you think this
is helping, Sarah?

11:22.956 --> 11:24.524
There's nothing wrong
with Sarah.

11:24.659 --> 11:28.154
She's a perfectly
normal teenager.

11:28.289 --> 11:32.197
She doesn't talk.
She's withdrawn.

11:32.332 --> 11:35.162
She doesn't want to participate.
I mean, that can't be normal.

11:35.298 --> 11:38.035
That's typical behaviour
for anxiety.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.305
Anxiety?

11:41.440 --> 11:45.240
I understand you and Ash are
having some marital problems.

11:47.510 --> 11:49.382
Are you saying that I make
my daughter anxious?

11:49.517 --> 11:51.983
You and your husband.

11:55.883 --> 12:00.016
Look. I can see you're going
through a tough situation.

12:00.151 --> 12:02.988
But it's up to married couples
to show their children how to...

12:03.123 --> 12:06.122
Show them what?

12:06.257 --> 12:07.900
How to be happy.

12:18.570 --> 12:21.078
Could you go any slower honey?

12:26.920 --> 12:29.479
Do we really need
to bring the bow?

12:29.614 --> 12:31.990
Yes we do. It needs a restring.

12:32.889 --> 12:34.488
Okay, no worries.

12:34.623 --> 12:37.523
-Who are you texting?
-None of your business.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.642
Hey Ben, what's up?

12:59.778 --> 13:01.711
The Shanghai fund's
just landed.

13:01.846 --> 13:04.255
Waiting for it
to clear later today,

13:04.390 --> 13:06.920
but it looks like it's going
to be the whole thirty.

13:07.056 --> 13:08.425
Great work, Benny.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.693
Alright, let's get Thomas paid
his nice kicker on the deal.

13:10.828 --> 13:11.729
Have you told him?

13:11.864 --> 13:13.697
He's not been in yet today.

13:13.832 --> 13:15.163
Well give him a call.

13:15.299 --> 13:17.871
I have.
He's not picking up.

13:18.539 --> 13:19.431
That's weird.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.036
I think he's still
pissed with you.

13:21.172 --> 13:23.610
Me?
I didn't force him out.

13:23.745 --> 13:25.211
It was his own choice to leave.

13:25.347 --> 13:28.279
Yep. Well, I guess it was
just bad timing on his half, eh?

13:28.415 --> 13:31.814
That's business, Benny.
Not everyone can be a winner.

13:31.949 --> 13:33.650
I'll try him again.

13:33.785 --> 13:35.647
All right, thanks.

13:36.918 --> 13:39.619
You okay?

13:39.755 --> 13:42.462
If it means your work's done
for the weekend, I am.

13:42.597 --> 13:44.827
Yeah, it's sorted now.

13:44.962 --> 13:47.362
Family time, promise.

14:25.837 --> 14:27.831
What do you think?

14:28.644 --> 14:30.834
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

14:41.456 --> 14:43.682
All right.

15:06.410 --> 15:08.713
That's a
pretty great view.

15:08.848 --> 15:10.709
Thought you'd like it.

15:19.993 --> 15:23.155
-Dad!
-Yeah, hang on. Hang on.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.609
Oh, hey. Hey there.

15:38.744 --> 15:40.104
Heard the alarm.

15:40.239 --> 15:43.249
Oh yeah, sorry. I forgot to
enter the code. My apologies.

15:43.384 --> 15:46.650
That's okay. If you need
anything, let me know.

15:46.785 --> 15:48.318
Thank you.

15:55.059 --> 15:57.657
Knock, knock ladies.

15:59.097 --> 16:00.529
This place is pretty great, Ash.

16:00.664 --> 16:03.227
Yeah, I know, right?
What do you reckon, Sarah?

16:03.362 --> 16:05.401
Yeah, it's cool.

16:08.638 --> 16:11.242
Hey, why don't we go
explore the forest?

16:11.377 --> 16:13.204
Now that's a good idea.
What do you think?

16:13.340 --> 16:14.276
Do we have to?

16:14.412 --> 16:16.311
Come on, now.
It's gonna be fun.

16:16.446 --> 16:18.444
Got your phone!
Let's go my love!

16:18.579 --> 16:20.811
Oh, look how much
you've grown up.

16:20.946 --> 16:24.791
-Who is this guy?
-Give me my phone!

16:54.280 --> 16:57.351
Thomas, it's Ash. I've been
trying to reach you all day.

16:57.486 --> 16:59.088
The Shanghai deal
is closed, mate.

16:59.224 --> 17:01.094
Give me a call when you free.

17:03.322 --> 17:04.959
Any word?

17:05.095 --> 17:07.562
Still nothing.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.670
I thought you promised no work
while you were here.

17:12.805 --> 17:15.433
Yeah, I'm sorry.

17:15.569 --> 17:18.507
He always gets back to me.

17:18.643 --> 17:21.510
Maybe he's just spending time
with his wife.

17:22.616 --> 17:23.911
Susan?

17:24.046 --> 17:25.547
Yeah.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.453
He must be.

17:34.796 --> 17:36.294
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:36.429 --> 17:38.692
Just wanted to come in
and say goodnight.

17:47.004 --> 17:49.241
Everything okay?

17:50.971 --> 17:53.839
I hope you and Dad
can work things out.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.586
We are trying.

18:01.722 --> 18:03.915
I know.

18:05.827 --> 18:08.626
Oh Sarah, I'm sorry.

18:08.761 --> 18:10.458
Sorry?

18:10.593 --> 18:13.957
For putting you
through all this.

18:14.092 --> 18:16.026
You know it's not your fault,
right?

18:16.161 --> 18:19.898
Yeah. And it's not
your fault either, Mum.

18:26.144 --> 18:27.945
Get some sleep, yeah?

18:28.081 --> 18:29.279
Yeah, ten more minutes.

18:29.415 --> 18:32.251
I've heard
that one before.

18:39.256 --> 18:41.651
Second bottle?

18:41.786 --> 18:43.654
Well, I'm celebrating.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.663
Want me to pour you a glass?

18:45.798 --> 18:47.728
Sure.

18:55.844 --> 18:58.376
-Hmm.
-Not bad?

19:03.385 --> 19:06.310
I think this weekend's
going to be good for her.

19:06.445 --> 19:07.951
Yeah.

19:08.087 --> 19:10.181
Fresh air will help.

19:10.317 --> 19:13.688
I think it's the fact that
we're all together for once.

19:15.157 --> 19:17.322
True.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.463
So cheers.

19:20.296 --> 19:22.328
Cheers to us.

19:37.919 --> 19:40.550
I need more time, Ash.

19:49.726 --> 19:52.496
So I guess I'm sleeping
downstairs?

19:53.031 --> 19:55.026
Please.

19:57.104 --> 19:59.338
Well can we talk about it?

20:00.137 --> 20:02.037
I don't want to.

20:02.172 --> 20:04.838
Not tonight.

20:18.992 --> 20:21.459
Sweet dreams.

21:17.843 --> 21:20.276
Hey, not yet.

21:22.683 --> 21:24.690
We haven't got clearance.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.923
From who?

21:27.058 --> 21:28.519
Ryker!

21:28.655 --> 21:30.586
He's here?

21:30.721 --> 21:31.964
Yeah.

21:32.099 --> 21:34.397
He's out there somewhere.

21:34.532 --> 21:36.501
He'll text us when we're ready.

22:27.580 --> 22:28.777
Wake up!

22:28.913 --> 22:30.590
Jesus Christ!

22:30.725 --> 22:34.251
Ryker says that they've put
the perimeter alarm on.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.327
-You know the code, right?
-Yeah.

22:36.463 --> 22:38.863
-Do you know the code?
-Yes!

22:38.998 --> 22:40.697
Good.

22:41.697 --> 22:43.225
So here's the plan of the house.

22:43.361 --> 22:46.172
You get the kid,
I'll get the parents.

22:46.307 --> 22:47.271
Don't kill her,
all right?

22:47.406 --> 22:50.201
Yeah, I won't.

22:53.179 --> 22:55.239
And we're up.

25:22.494 --> 25:24.696
The phones are jammed.

27:23.878 --> 27:24.742
Ash!

27:24.877 --> 27:26.316
Kate?

27:34.227 --> 27:35.252
Kate!

27:35.388 --> 27:38.731
-Shhhh.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.365
Kate!

27:46.866 --> 27:48.532
Kate!

27:49.176 --> 27:50.671
Kate!

27:50.806 --> 27:54.208
Hey! Hey! Kate?

27:58.782 --> 28:01.050
Who the hell are you?

28:01.185 --> 28:04.614
You're going to do
exactly as I fucking say.

28:46.266 --> 28:47.628
We good?

28:47.763 --> 28:49.029
Put this in.

28:49.164 --> 28:51.197
-What's this?
-Military grade.

28:51.333 --> 28:54.196
Ryker put a
relay in the forest.

28:54.332 --> 28:56.006
Can you handle them?

28:57.644 --> 28:59.168
Yeah, you can trust me.

29:17.294 --> 29:22.494
Hey, there she is.
Welcome back, Katey.

29:28.902 --> 29:32.207
You know I can't understand
a word you're saying, right?

29:39.687 --> 29:42.822
Look Kate, it's really simple.

29:42.957 --> 29:45.982
Do as you're told
or I kill your kid, right?

29:46.117 --> 29:47.519
Yeah?

29:50.055 --> 29:51.622
Good.

31:01.093 --> 31:01.998
Oh shit!

31:02.133 --> 31:04.365
Where's my wife
and daughter?

31:05.198 --> 31:07.197
They're safe.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.934
Fuck! Please, fuck!

31:10.070 --> 31:11.375
Beg me.

31:11.511 --> 31:12.576
Please?

31:12.711 --> 31:14.914
-Beg me.
-Please!

31:15.615 --> 31:18.445
Fuck. Ah shit!

31:25.087 --> 31:27.256
What the hell is this?

31:28.629 --> 31:30.655
You're a smart guy.

31:36.163 --> 31:38.069
What do you want?

31:38.769 --> 31:40.896
Your money, Ash!

31:45.339 --> 31:48.110
This is a fucking robbery?

31:48.246 --> 31:53.247
See? I just said you
were a smart guy.

31:53.383 --> 31:55.986
But it's not really
a robbery, is it?

31:56.122 --> 31:59.282
It's more of a
quiet transaction.

32:03.726 --> 32:10.002
Three systems. Three servers.
Three different ISPs.

32:16.168 --> 32:17.537
Clear?

32:18.808 --> 32:19.940
I can't.

32:20.075 --> 32:21.377
You can't what?

32:21.513 --> 32:23.581
My business partner has the
matching set of codes

32:23.717 --> 32:24.674
to access the funds.

32:24.810 --> 32:27.415
Only he knows his codes,
so I can't do it.

32:30.389 --> 32:32.816
No, if that's not correct,
the system shuts you out.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.989
It's not like an ATM.
You get one chance.

32:36.125 --> 32:37.953
It's the right code.

32:41.032 --> 32:43.227
How'd you get the code?

32:43.363 --> 32:45.334
We asked him for it.

32:50.870 --> 32:54.404
Do it, Ash.
Whatever they want you to do.

32:54.540 --> 32:57.112
-Tom.
-Just do it.

32:57.247 --> 33:00.052
-Please!
-Okay, I see, I see.

33:03.952 --> 33:05.948
So!

33:06.083 --> 33:08.958
I want you to transfer
ten million dollars

33:09.094 --> 33:11.858
into three separate accounts.

33:11.993 --> 33:12.862
Okay?

33:12.997 --> 33:14.525
You have three hours.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.063
I need way
more than that.

33:17.199 --> 33:18.827
No. No fucking way.

33:18.963 --> 33:21.171
It takes time to reroute
that much, okay?

33:21.306 --> 33:23.398
There are limit
protocols in place.

33:23.533 --> 33:24.904
Limit protocols?

33:25.039 --> 33:29.079
Yeah, I can't just transfer
ten million dollars in one go.

33:29.215 --> 33:31.581
I think it's just
a million at a time.

33:31.717 --> 33:33.149
Well...

33:33.284 --> 33:36.388
You can take all
the time you need.

33:36.523 --> 33:42.193
But your wife and kid, they're
gonna be dead in three hours

33:42.329 --> 33:45.891
unless the transaction is done.
You get it?

33:46.026 --> 33:48.029
Yeah all right, I'll do it,
okay? I'll do it, okay?

33:48.165 --> 33:49.294
No argument, all right?

33:49.430 --> 33:51.802
Then turn the fuck around.

33:51.937 --> 33:53.996
All right. Okay. Fuck!

34:56.261 --> 35:00.766
Yeah, you have got some spunk,
Kate. I have to say.

35:02.710 --> 35:04.506
I'm impressed.

35:13.950 --> 35:20.522
Do you realise, I could do
whatever the fuck I want to you?

35:23.089 --> 35:27.529
It's like your life is
completely in my hands.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.467
And yet you still fight me.

35:30.602 --> 35:34.239
Brave or stupid, Kate.
Which one are you, huh?

35:41.573 --> 35:43.248
That's my girl.

35:56.820 --> 35:58.725
Give me your hands.

36:01.429 --> 36:04.236
It's okay. It's okay.

36:07.300 --> 36:09.866
You do realise the program
needs both our retina scans

36:10.001 --> 36:12.244
before anything
can be finalised?

36:16.043 --> 36:17.982
You don't get it.
Thomas needs to scan as well.

36:18.118 --> 36:19.647
There are fail-safes in place.

36:32.856 --> 36:34.800
What the hell is that?

36:34.935 --> 36:36.994
Open it and find out.

36:43.976 --> 36:46.278
Oh fuck! Jesus!

36:49.008 --> 36:52.944
So we've already
scanned Thomas's eye.

36:53.079 --> 36:56.750
We can do this the easy way,
or the hard way.

36:59.287 --> 37:01.084
Your choice.

37:19.746 --> 37:21.544
Attaboy!

37:23.241 --> 37:25.083
Okay Sarah, you have
to pull your hand out.

37:25.218 --> 37:27.413
Pull. Pull, baby.
I know it hurts.

37:27.549 --> 37:29.252
Pull. Pull. Come on, pull.

37:29.388 --> 37:32.522
Okay, go, go, go,
go, go, go, pull.

37:36.624 --> 37:38.891
Hide it. Hide it, hide it.

37:47.169 --> 37:51.241
Holy shit, Kate. I have to
say you are one lucky lady.

37:51.377 --> 37:55.072
This place is
very, very fancy.

38:02.555 --> 38:04.588
All right look,
I think I need a coffee

38:04.723 --> 38:06.756
because if I just stand here
staring at you two,

38:06.892 --> 38:12.221
I'll probably doze off and then,
God knows what will happen.

38:13.830 --> 38:15.557
Hey, but no funny business,
all right?

38:15.692 --> 38:18.568
Otherwise I will have to beat
the shit out of both of you.

38:23.708 --> 38:26.708
You know I bet you
it's automatic, right?

38:28.048 --> 38:29.942
The coffee machine.

38:32.578 --> 38:34.144
You rich people.

39:26.431 --> 39:30.069
-This is Kane.
-Checking in. All good?

39:30.204 --> 39:35.372
Ah, yeah, no, everything
is ah... running smoothly.

39:35.508 --> 39:38.476
Good. By tonight,
you're going to be very rich.

39:38.611 --> 39:40.815
Copy that.

40:10.714 --> 40:13.084
-Shhhh.

40:13.220 --> 40:15.916
Baby, look at me. Come on.

40:44.778 --> 40:47.442
Here baby, let's go.

40:57.329 --> 41:00.361
You son of a bitch!

41:00.496 --> 41:01.797
Okay, he's coming.

41:01.932 --> 41:03.365
- Baby, I need you to run.
- No, no, no!

41:03.501 --> 41:04.535
Look at me. Look at me.

41:04.671 --> 41:06.498
You can be our hero.
I need you to run.

41:06.634 --> 41:08.705
Go, baby. Go. Go!

41:35.463 --> 41:37.327
No!

41:51.347 --> 41:54.718
Yeah, I bet you discovered
all the doors are locked huh?

41:56.383 --> 41:58.952
Yeah, well unfortunately
for you, Katey,

41:59.087 --> 42:02.286
I am the only one
with the fucking keys.

42:31.149 --> 42:33.515
When I find you Kate...

42:35.422 --> 42:38.487
...I am going to carve
my name in your back.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.700
Teach you a real good
fucking lesson.

43:37.390 --> 43:39.655
That wasn't brave, Kate.

43:39.790 --> 43:43.420
That was really, really stupid.

43:45.158 --> 43:47.226
But I did say I was impressed.

44:24.170 --> 44:26.034
You okay?

44:30.133 --> 44:32.066
Is he dead?

44:32.202 --> 44:33.943
I don't know.

44:35.010 --> 44:37.309
Sarah, give me some zip ties.

44:38.515 --> 44:40.444
Sarah, zip ties!

44:56.099 --> 44:59.199
How do you like that?
You bastard!

45:37.210 --> 45:41.039
-Status?
-Proceeding as planned.

45:41.174 --> 45:43.571
-Copy that.
-You?

45:43.707 --> 45:46.878
We're good.
Just make the transfers.

45:47.013 --> 45:48.611
Copy that, sir.

45:52.091 --> 45:56.795
Try that again and I will
fucking slit your throat.

45:57.329 --> 45:59.325
Okay.

46:01.501 --> 46:03.626
Where's my husband?

46:05.531 --> 46:07.905
Where's my husband!

46:11.170 --> 46:13.174
Fuck you, is where.

46:15.538 --> 46:16.738
You know when Reed gets back

46:16.873 --> 46:20.247
she is going to punish
you both big time.

46:21.444 --> 46:23.085
Who the hell is she?

46:23.784 --> 46:25.857
Reed?

46:27.150 --> 46:29.124
A maniac.

46:31.495 --> 46:32.653
Yeah?

46:32.789 --> 46:35.031
Well I can get
pretty crazy, too.

46:35.166 --> 46:39.231
Especially when you
threaten my family.

46:39.367 --> 46:45.033
Yeah, not like her.
She's ex-Army.

46:45.168 --> 46:50.048
Served in Syria. You have no
idea who you're dealing with.

46:50.183 --> 46:54.314
Hey, why don't you ask
Mummy to untie me and I'll...

46:55.912 --> 46:58.582
I'll ask her to go
easy on you two, huh?

47:00.725 --> 47:02.322
Hope your jaw hurts.

47:03.056 --> 47:04.819
Sarah!

47:17.233 --> 47:19.835
Okay.

47:19.970 --> 47:22.574
Sarah, I need you to go
next door, and I need you

47:22.709 --> 47:24.141
to get the neighbours
to call the cops, okay?

47:24.276 --> 47:25.345
Can you come with me?

47:25.480 --> 47:26.374
No baby, I've got to
stay here and watch him.

47:26.509 --> 47:28.111
You can do this, okay?

47:28.246 --> 47:30.779
-Okay.
-Go.

47:48.567 --> 47:54.011
Help us, please!
Oh please! Please!

47:56.682 --> 47:57.706
Hey, what's happening?

47:57.842 --> 48:01.718
We had a home invasion.
They took Dad.

48:01.854 --> 48:03.087
I need you to call the police.

48:03.223 --> 48:06.749
Okay, just breathe. Take
deep breaths. You're safe now.

48:08.089 --> 48:09.289
Where's your mother?

48:09.424 --> 48:11.686
She's inside,
watching one of them.

48:11.822 --> 48:15.132
-She caught one?
-Yeah, he's all tied up.

48:15.268 --> 48:20.730
Is he really? Oh, you poor girl.
Come inside, quickly.

48:29.742 --> 48:33.743
Now, it's going to be okay.
Have a seat.

48:36.547 --> 48:39.419
Okay. I'm gonna call the police,

48:39.554 --> 48:41.448
and then we're gonna
go help your parents.

48:41.584 --> 48:43.819
-Okay?
-Yeah.

49:10.485 --> 49:12.854
Hello, yes,
this is an emergency.

49:12.990 --> 49:14.784
We've had
a home invasion.

49:15.626 --> 49:16.988
Yes.

49:17.124 --> 49:19.360
5 Cambey Way.

49:20.467 --> 49:21.527
Thanks.

49:22.161 --> 49:24.633
Thank you.

49:24.769 --> 49:27.203
Kane, update.

49:29.398 --> 49:30.932
Kane.

49:33.145 --> 49:35.208
Ryker, no response
from the house.

49:35.343 --> 49:37.277
Need you to
check status.

49:37.412 --> 49:41.811
I repeat. Need you
to check status.

49:44.557 --> 49:46.016
For fuck's sake!

49:46.151 --> 49:47.119
What?

49:47.255 --> 49:48.088
They're not responding.

49:48.223 --> 49:51.326
-Both of them?
-Yes.

49:51.461 --> 49:54.657
Keep your sidearm drawn.
Stay two metres away.

49:54.793 --> 49:57.498
-What's up?
-You. Get outside now.

49:57.634 --> 50:01.204
Keep your eyes on the perimeter.
No one in, no one out.

50:03.206 --> 50:04.942
You know it can't
be comms, right?

50:05.078 --> 50:06.268
We've double checked
all our gear.

50:06.404 --> 50:07.870
I don't know.

50:09.042 --> 50:10.147
Wait.

50:12.717 --> 50:13.983
What if...

50:14.119 --> 50:15.477
What if they're
compromised?

50:15.613 --> 50:16.647
What the hell do we do?

50:16.783 --> 50:18.618
No one is compromised,
do you hear me?

50:18.753 --> 50:21.782
They just don't have
their comms on. It happens.

50:21.918 --> 50:25.657
This!
That's the job, okay?

50:26.493 --> 50:29.331
-Okay.
-Good. Eyes up.

50:45.617 --> 50:47.551
Mum!

50:47.687 --> 50:49.114
Are you okay?

50:49.250 --> 50:50.515
Did you call the police?

50:50.650 --> 50:53.322
We did.
They're on their way.

50:56.052 --> 50:58.553
You got a real
little soldier here.

50:58.689 --> 51:00.531
Yeah, I'm proud of her.

51:00.667 --> 51:02.628
You should be.

51:04.627 --> 51:07.435
Who's that loser?

51:07.571 --> 51:09.539
He's just some
dickhead who broke in.

51:09.674 --> 51:12.009
Jesus!

51:12.144 --> 51:14.277
What a complete
fucking idiot.

51:16.912 --> 51:20.481
There have been a few break-ins
around here recently.

51:21.846 --> 51:24.485
I installed a new
alarm as well.

51:29.592 --> 51:33.056
Then again,
my father would have said,

51:33.191 --> 51:36.893
"You don't need an alarm
if you've got good neighbours."

51:57.984 --> 52:00.290
Did they say how long
they were going to be?

52:00.890 --> 52:02.755
What?

52:02.891 --> 52:05.620
The police. Did they say
how long they're going to be?

52:05.755 --> 52:09.123
Oh. They said an hour.

52:09.602 --> 52:10.629
An hour?

52:10.765 --> 52:12.665
We're less than
thirty minutes from town.

52:18.635 --> 52:20.706
They must be busy.

52:23.913 --> 52:25.106
Yeah.

52:43.764 --> 52:46.699
You didn't ask me
where my husband was.

52:51.542 --> 52:55.411
-What's going on, Mum?
-Sarah, don't move.

53:06.118 --> 53:08.985
Well I thought I gave a
convincing performance.

53:10.390 --> 53:11.691
Get the girl.

53:12.489 --> 53:13.858
No!

53:15.195 --> 53:16.658
No!

53:16.794 --> 53:17.798
No! No!

53:17.934 --> 53:19.131
No!

53:22.534 --> 53:24.374
Oh fuck!

53:28.139 --> 53:31.612
-Shut the fuck up!

53:39.787 --> 53:44.493
Watch her!
I'll take care of this.

53:52.762 --> 53:54.503
Where are you?

53:56.238 --> 53:58.100
Come on, Kate.

53:59.339 --> 54:01.345
We've got Sarah!

54:19.424 --> 54:21.156
Kate!

54:40.414 --> 54:41.951
Drop the knife.

54:42.087 --> 54:44.421
Are you fucking serious?

55:21.291 --> 55:22.950
What are you doing?

55:23.086 --> 55:25.827
-I'm done.
-It's sent?

55:25.963 --> 55:27.530
No.

55:37.505 --> 55:38.840
What do you mean, no?

55:38.976 --> 55:42.777
I want to check on my family.
I want proof they're safe.

55:42.912 --> 55:45.044
-Listen, arsehole...
-No, you listen, arsehole!

55:45.179 --> 55:49.046
I'm not sending one cent
until I know my family is safe.

55:53.886 --> 55:55.456
You there?

55:55.591 --> 55:57.692
What is it?

55:58.926 --> 56:00.725
This arsehole wants
proof of life

56:00.861 --> 56:02.961
before he makes
a transfer.

56:03.096 --> 56:06.837
-Repeat, he wants proof...
-I heard you.

56:08.371 --> 56:10.007
-Mick?
-Yeah.

56:10.142 --> 56:11.174
Bring out the hostage.

56:11.310 --> 56:12.734
We need to
move this along.

56:12.869 --> 56:14.373
Will do.

56:14.509 --> 56:17.778
This fucking family.

56:24.622 --> 56:27.683
-Thomas!
-Ash. I couldn't do anything.

56:27.819 --> 56:29.458
They killed my wife.

56:29.593 --> 56:31.858
-Oh my God. Susan?
-She's dead.

56:31.993 --> 56:33.130
He's told us about
the security protocols

56:33.265 --> 56:34.198
you put in the system, Ash.

56:34.333 --> 56:36.164
We know it alerts
the authorities.

56:36.300 --> 56:37.661
You've gotta fix it.

56:37.796 --> 56:40.838
Come on, Ash. Just do it.

56:40.973 --> 56:41.697
It's only money.

56:41.832 --> 56:43.771
-I can't.
-Please.

56:45.677 --> 56:49.236
Fix it Ash,
or I'll kill him right here.

56:49.372 --> 56:54.776
Okay. Okay. I'll fix it.
You have my word.

56:54.911 --> 56:57.521
-Please.
-Please.

57:21.573 --> 57:23.907
Ryker!

57:24.043 --> 57:26.583
Is everything
okay up there?

57:32.251 --> 57:34.486
-What the hell happened?
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

57:34.622 --> 57:35.791
That fucking woman!

57:35.926 --> 57:37.585
That fucking woman, all right?
She has skills.

57:37.721 --> 57:43.166
Ryker went up there to take care
of her but it's gone quiet.

57:43.301 --> 57:45.162
He isn't coming back!

57:46.803 --> 57:48.903
I think that bitch
has killed him.

57:49.038 --> 57:51.833
Well get up there and
sort this shit out now.

57:51.968 --> 57:53.076
You fucking do it.

57:53.211 --> 57:54.169
This is your mess.

57:54.305 --> 57:56.204
Look what she did
to my fucking face!

57:56.339 --> 57:59.473
Yeah?
And I'll do much worse.

57:59.608 --> 58:03.612
Now you get up there and
you fucking get her now!

58:03.747 --> 58:05.479
Fuck!

58:08.591 --> 58:11.419
Get up. Get up. Get up.

58:12.760 --> 58:14.362
Want to watch your Mum die?

58:14.497 --> 58:16.628
Sarah, you okay honey?

58:16.763 --> 58:19.231
Yeah she's fine, Kate.

58:19.367 --> 58:22.365
Hey, why don't you come on
down and we'll have a chat, huh?

58:22.500 --> 58:25.939
Why don't you let my daughter go
and I'll spare you?

58:27.036 --> 58:29.874
That's very funny.

58:30.010 --> 58:32.983
Remember,
I'm the one with the gun.

58:42.325 --> 58:44.023
Fuck this.

59:05.908 --> 59:07.541
Hi, Kate.

59:12.157 --> 59:13.514
Let her go.

59:18.154 --> 59:19.553
Don't fucking move.

59:21.763 --> 59:24.228
Please just let her go.

59:25.996 --> 59:27.935
Put the bow down.

59:30.672 --> 59:33.435
Put the fucking bow down.

59:43.651 --> 59:45.656
Get on your knees.

59:50.395 --> 59:52.894
You shut the fuck up.

59:53.826 --> 59:55.831
Don't move.

1:00:06.038 --> 1:00:07.568
Hands behind your back.

1:00:14.516 --> 1:00:16.119
It's okay, baby.

1:00:16.255 --> 1:00:17.985
Shut the fuck up.

1:00:22.326 --> 1:00:23.626
Look at me.

1:00:23.762 --> 1:00:26.120
-Look at me.
-What are you doing?

1:00:27.524 --> 1:00:29.230
Your husband
wants proof of life.

1:00:29.365 --> 1:00:30.800
What?

1:00:31.796 --> 1:00:33.704
Why?

1:00:44.273 --> 1:00:45.940
Who the fuck is that?

1:00:46.076 --> 1:00:48.380
I don't know.

1:00:48.515 --> 1:00:52.987
If you make a sound,
I will gut you. Do you hear me?

1:01:04.092 --> 1:01:05.125
Hello.

1:01:05.261 --> 1:01:08.228
Oh, hello. Is Kate here?

1:01:08.363 --> 1:01:10.371
Yeah. Ah, who are you?

1:01:10.506 --> 1:01:11.905
Her father.

1:01:12.041 --> 1:01:14.437
Oh, it's nice of you
to come visit.

1:01:15.906 --> 1:01:17.946
Come in.

1:01:20.243 --> 1:01:22.643
She's just in the lounge.

1:01:25.115 --> 1:01:26.815
What the hell!

1:01:26.950 --> 1:01:28.355
Sarah!

1:01:28.490 --> 1:01:31.251
Kate!

1:01:31.387 --> 1:01:32.856
Look, just do as she says.

1:01:32.992 --> 1:01:35.126
Just do as she says.

1:01:35.262 --> 1:01:37.493
Don't you just love
family reunions?

1:01:39.194 --> 1:01:41.500
So touching.

1:01:42.571 --> 1:01:45.174
No! No! No!

1:01:46.501 --> 1:01:49.208
Oh my God, Dad!
No!

1:01:54.051 --> 1:01:56.748
-I told you not to fuck with me.
-I didn't!

1:01:56.884 --> 1:01:59.449
Don't! She's my Mum.

1:02:01.623 --> 1:02:03.090
Please!

1:02:12.033 --> 1:02:16.103
You're tough.
I like that.

1:02:19.478 --> 1:02:20.402
You know in another life,

1:02:20.538 --> 1:02:22.538
we probably could
have been friends.

1:02:24.713 --> 1:02:26.641
I doubt that.

1:02:29.221 --> 1:02:31.085
Okay.

1:02:36.261 --> 1:02:37.287
No!

1:02:37.423 --> 1:02:39.729
I'm taking your daughter
as insurance.

1:02:39.865 --> 1:02:42.798
If you call the cops,
she's dead.

1:02:42.934 --> 1:02:45.228
If you leave this house,
she's dead.

1:02:45.363 --> 1:02:48.663
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

1:02:50.971 --> 1:02:52.876
I'm being merciful.

1:02:55.504 --> 1:02:57.144
You can thank me later.

1:03:08.119 --> 1:03:09.491
We all good here?

1:03:09.627 --> 1:03:11.422
Yeah, almost there.

1:03:12.664 --> 1:03:14.221
Have you got a spare clip?

1:03:14.357 --> 1:03:16.031
Yeah, sure brother.

1:03:20.739 --> 1:03:24.939
Hey.
Any plans with your cut?

1:03:25.075 --> 1:03:29.571
-Nah, mate.
-Come on. Job like this?

1:03:29.706 --> 1:03:32.541
Don't tell me you haven't
thought about it.

1:03:32.676 --> 1:03:37.316
Let me guess.
A Ferrari. Am I right?

1:04:19.694 --> 1:04:21.525
Kate.

1:04:22.796 --> 1:04:24.825
Kate.

1:04:26.470 --> 1:04:28.598
Kate.

1:04:35.578 --> 1:04:37.607
Dad?

1:04:38.747 --> 1:04:40.918
Oh God!

1:04:41.751 --> 1:04:45.948
Hold on. Hold on.

1:04:46.083 --> 1:04:47.815
Daddy?

1:04:51.825 --> 1:04:53.557
Daddy.

1:04:56.525 --> 1:04:58.367
Remember what I said.

1:04:58.502 --> 1:05:00.233
What?

1:05:00.368 --> 1:05:04.340
Have courage.
Get your family back.

1:05:04.475 --> 1:05:05.943
What? No!

1:05:09.605 --> 1:05:12.944
I can't. She broke my bow.

1:05:13.080 --> 1:05:15.913
My bow's in my car.

1:05:16.049 --> 1:05:18.351
Do what you know.

1:05:19.888 --> 1:05:21.992
I love you, Kate.

1:05:23.553 --> 1:05:25.160
No, no. No, no, no, no.

1:05:27.762 --> 1:05:28.893
No.

1:05:29.029 --> 1:05:32.701
No, Dad! Dad?

1:05:32.836 --> 1:05:35.401
No! No, Daddy, please!

1:05:36.133 --> 1:05:37.832
Oh no.

1:05:39.578 --> 1:05:42.540
No!

1:05:45.912 --> 1:05:48.381
No...

1:05:49.344 --> 1:05:51.351
No...

1:07:02.120 --> 1:07:03.852
Come on.

1:07:07.466 --> 1:07:08.956
Got you.

1:07:22.043 --> 1:07:24.404
Visitor.

1:07:26.778 --> 1:07:28.745
-Are you okay?
-I am.

1:07:28.880 --> 1:07:32.119
-This fucking family.
-Don't you hurt her!

1:07:32.255 --> 1:07:35.023
Please, don't
hurt my daughter.

1:07:35.159 --> 1:07:38.522
Don't worry
about her, Ash.

1:07:38.657 --> 1:07:41.190
Finish the
fucking transaction.

1:07:41.325 --> 1:07:43.331
Where's my wife?

1:07:44.669 --> 1:07:47.830
Alive. Just.

1:07:51.900 --> 1:07:53.702
What have you
done to her?

1:07:53.837 --> 1:07:56.546
I taught her a
fucking lesson.

1:07:56.682 --> 1:07:58.940
Now wrap this up.

1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:14.292
The last million
is transferring.

1:08:14.428 --> 1:08:17.330
-Check it.
-It's done.

1:08:17.466 --> 1:08:20.533
It was the right thing
to do, Ash.

1:08:29.013 --> 1:08:31.379
Come on.

1:08:34.577 --> 1:08:36.384
It's all there.

1:08:42.892 --> 1:08:44.854
Well done, boss.

1:08:49.624 --> 1:08:51.361
Fuck me, Thomas.

1:08:51.497 --> 1:08:54.270
You're behind all of this?

1:08:57.238 --> 1:08:59.334
What have you done?

1:09:03.242 --> 1:09:05.072
Your...

1:09:07.247 --> 1:09:09.318
It was Susan's.

1:09:16.585 --> 1:09:18.360
You betrayed me.

1:09:19.126 --> 1:09:20.390
You betrayed us.

1:09:20.525 --> 1:09:21.890
Everything we worked for.

1:09:22.026 --> 1:09:25.367
You put my family's
lives in jeopardy!

1:09:26.365 --> 1:09:27.832
How dare you?

1:09:27.967 --> 1:09:32.370
How fucking dare you
talk to me about deception.

1:09:32.505 --> 1:09:36.543
You slept with my wife, Ash.

1:09:39.446 --> 1:09:42.549
Yes!
Of course I knew.

1:09:45.956 --> 1:09:47.281
It was a mistake.

1:09:47.417 --> 1:09:51.789
Oh, you're telling me.
My wife is dead because of you.

1:09:51.924 --> 1:09:54.891
Because of your greed
to take everything.

1:09:55.027 --> 1:09:59.896
To steal my business.
To even fuck my wife.

1:10:01.502 --> 1:10:05.668
Well... Now, you're gonna pay.

1:10:05.804 --> 1:10:07.403
What was it you
said again?

1:10:07.539 --> 1:10:09.708
Ah... Oh yeah, yeah.

1:10:09.844 --> 1:10:14.548
It's business.
Not everyone can be a winner.

1:12:10.433 --> 1:12:11.900
Kane and Ryker are dead.

1:12:12.035 --> 1:12:12.826
What? How?

1:12:12.962 --> 1:12:15.262
How?
She killed them.

1:12:37.294 --> 1:12:39.121
What the hell was that?

1:12:39.854 --> 1:12:41.294
She's here!

1:12:41.430 --> 1:12:42.893
Hold her off a bit longer.

1:12:43.028 --> 1:12:44.700
I just need to confirm
the transfers.

1:12:44.836 --> 1:12:45.930
Will do.

1:12:46.065 --> 1:12:47.529
Don't mess around.
She's a trained archer.

1:12:47.665 --> 1:12:48.563
Shoot to kill.

1:14:39.181 --> 1:14:40.473
Come on.

1:14:55.828 --> 1:14:57.828
Finally!
It's confirmed.

1:14:57.963 --> 1:15:00.768
-So it's all there?
-Yep.

1:15:07.477 --> 1:15:10.140
Don't even fucking try it.

1:15:20.816 --> 1:15:21.921
Dad!

1:15:22.818 --> 1:15:24.286
The gun!

1:15:36.134 --> 1:15:40.067
-Sarah?
-Mum! I'm okay. I'm okay.

1:16:01.124 --> 1:16:02.692
I got this. It's all good.

1:16:02.827 --> 1:16:03.824
-You go.
-Okay.

1:16:03.959 --> 1:16:05.668
Be careful.

1:16:12.543 --> 1:16:14.033
Yeah, that's not coming undone.

1:16:14.169 --> 1:16:16.076
Dad! Watch out, Dad!

1:16:16.212 --> 1:16:17.713
Stop it!

1:16:23.985 --> 1:16:26.651
You can
break into my house.

1:16:26.787 --> 1:16:28.186
You can steal my money.

1:16:28.321 --> 1:16:31.661
But don't you ever threaten
my fucking family!

1:16:44.737 --> 1:16:46.709
Oh my God!

1:18:41.625 --> 1:18:44.090
That's for the arrow, bitch!

1:18:58.567 --> 1:19:00.843
You couldn't just
leave it alone.

1:19:07.617 --> 1:19:10.347
I got you now, bitch!

1:19:34.511 --> 1:19:39.607
Mum. Mum!

1:21:00.992 --> 1:21:03.130
Kate!

1:21:06.833 --> 1:21:08.696
Kate!

1:21:18.108 --> 1:21:19.916
Sarah?

1:21:23.446 --> 1:21:25.178
-Having fun?
-Yeah.

1:21:25.314 --> 1:21:26.283
How's the leg?

1:21:26.419 --> 1:21:30.124
Hurts...
No, it's good. It's all right.

1:21:33.256 --> 1:21:35.125
Hey guys, look.

1:21:35.260 --> 1:21:36.498
Look what I found. A sea urchin.

1:21:36.634 --> 1:21:38.334
-Wow.
-Cool.

1:21:38.469 --> 1:21:39.595
Let me see.

1:21:39.731 --> 1:21:41.065
Did you know the sea urchin's
closest relatives

1:21:41.200 --> 1:21:42.668
are actually sea cucumbers?

1:21:42.803 --> 1:21:44.006
Cucumbers?

1:21:44.142 --> 1:21:46.774
-Not those cucumbers, Mum.
-Oh. I don't know!

1:21:46.909 --> 1:21:48.041
And they mostly eat seaweed.

1:21:48.177 --> 1:21:51.746
Oh yeah? Well I like
seaweed in soshi.

1:21:51.881 --> 1:21:54.245
-Sushi!
-It's Sushi?

1:21:54.381 --> 1:21:57.151
-No, it's sushi.
-Give it back. Thank you.

1:22:04.221 --> 1:22:05.455
She seems happier.

1:22:05.591 --> 1:22:07.857
I think she's more
relieved than happy.

1:22:07.992 --> 1:22:09.960
True.

1:22:10.095 --> 1:22:11.794
What about you?

1:22:11.930 --> 1:22:14.036
Me?

1:22:15.329 --> 1:22:17.699
Us?

1:22:19.570 --> 1:22:21.870
I've given it
a lot of thought.

1:22:22.006 --> 1:22:24.473
And?

1:22:24.609 --> 1:22:26.810
Yeah, I'll give you
one last chance.

1:22:26.946 --> 1:22:28.149
Really?

1:22:28.284 --> 1:22:30.678
But God help me Ash,
if you fuck up again,

1:22:30.814 --> 1:22:32.652
I'm probably going
to have to kill you.

1:22:32.788 --> 1:22:34.986
I don't doubt it.

1:22:35.122 --> 1:22:39.489
-I love you.
-Same.

1:22:46.360 --> 1:22:48.202
Ew, guys!
