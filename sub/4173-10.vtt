00:04.713 --> 00:06.798
BUFORD: Guys, can you
settle an argument for us?

00:06.798 --> 00:08.592
Preferably in my favor?

00:08.592 --> 00:11.303
If a vegetarian
becomes a zombie,

00:11.303 --> 00:12.554
would they start
eatin' people?

00:12.554 --> 00:14.181
Mr. Smarty-underpants thinks

00:14.181 --> 00:15.557
they'd just keep
eating vegetables.

00:15.599 --> 00:18.226
But they are,
after all, vegetarians.

00:18.226 --> 00:20.353
I guess they'd eat things
like heads of lettuce,

00:20.437 --> 00:24.232
Eye of potato!
Leg of carrot!

00:24.232 --> 00:26.109
What? Your carrots
don't have legs?

00:26.109 --> 00:27.569
Where do your
parents shop?

00:27.611 --> 00:29.362
Hey, guys.
What you doing?

00:29.446 --> 00:31.364
Oh, we're just solving
the world's problems.

00:31.448 --> 00:34.367
Zombie vegetarianism
is a world problem?

00:34.367 --> 00:35.869
Not yet,
but recycling is.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.580
We've got a lot of leftover
material from past inventions,

00:38.622 --> 00:40.248
and we're trying to figure
out what to do with it.

00:40.248 --> 00:43.126
My mom always just throws all
our leftovers into a pot

00:43.126 --> 00:44.461
and makes
a giant casserole.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.255
It's best to just eat first
and ask questions later.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.257
That's it! We'll use
all our leftovers

00:49.257 --> 00:50.759
and make an
invention casserole!

00:50.759 --> 00:53.136
Ferb, I know what
we're gonna do today!

00:53.136 --> 00:54.763
Hey, where's Perry?

00:54.763 --> 00:56.139
PARRY: I'm right here, guys.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.266
It's internet sensation
Parry Gripp!

00:58.266 --> 01:00.143
How's it going?
It's going well.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.270
But actually we were looking
for Perry the Platypus.

01:02.270 --> 01:05.732
Oops! Sorry for the
misunderstanding.

01:05.732 --> 01:09.152
Internet sensation Parry
Gripp, ladies and gentlemen!

01:09.152 --> 01:10.779
So, where's our Perry?

01:10.779 --> 01:12.405
LINDA:
Oh, here you go, Perry.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.116
I burnt another one.

01:14.116 --> 01:16.284
I guess that's what I get
for staying up all night.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.536
Unless I get
my act together,

01:17.536 --> 01:19.538
that means plenty more
for you, Perry.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.414
Red leather, yellow leather,
red leather, yellow leather.

01:21.414 --> 01:24.417
Lawrence, what on earth
are you doing?

01:24.417 --> 01:26.169
Oh, just a few
vocal exercises

01:26.169 --> 01:28.755
before my big speech for the
committee at the Danville museum.

01:28.755 --> 01:33.135
I'd love to, honey, but I've got
quite a lot of baking to do

01:33.135 --> 01:35.554
if I want to make my quota for
the Live and Let Pie event.

01:35.554 --> 01:38.431
<i>MALE ANNOUNCER". Live and let pie!
For charity.</i>

01:38.431 --> 01:40.267
Why don't you practice
in front of Candace?

01:40.267 --> 01:44.813
There's nothing teenagers love
more than listening to speeches.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.565
Okay, where was I?
(SNIFFS)

01:47.190 --> 01:48.817
Oh, no!

01:48.817 --> 01:51.820
Well, Perry, looks like
you've got yourself another...

01:51.820 --> 01:54.531
Uh, where's Perry?
Right here!

01:54.531 --> 01:56.449
Platypus. Oops. Didn't
mean to intrude.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.286
<i>MONOGRAM:

02:00.704 --> 02:03.331
<i>Guess whose birthday
it is, Agent P.</i>

02:03.331 --> 02:06.334
<i>It's not Carl's,
and it's not yours...</i>

02:06.334 --> 02:07.586
<i>Okay, okay, it's mine!</i>

02:07.586 --> 02:10.839

02:10.839 --> 02:12.716

02:12.716 --> 02:15.343
<i>Oh, well. We've noticed

02:38.700 --> 02:41.494
<i>Birthday!</i>

02:41.494 --> 02:44.206
<i>(SNIFFLES) That was
just beautiful.</i>

02:44.206 --> 02:46.374
Thank you for coming here
today to hear my speech

02:46.374 --> 02:48.501
on the history of the ancient
Ornithorhynchan tribe.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.379
The Ornithorhynchans were a
platypus worshipping society

02:51.379 --> 02:53.381
known for painting
themselves teal blue

02:53.381 --> 02:55.467
and wearing elaborate
platypus-themed costumes

02:55.467 --> 02:57.385
for their various
dances and rituals.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.512
Oh, you know what?
I just remembered.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.766
Some friends asked me to help
them form a giant human pyramid,

03:02.766 --> 03:05.518
and I told them that was the
last thing I wanted to do today,

03:05.518 --> 03:07.896
but it turns out I was wrong.
So, I gotta g0.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.397
The speech is great, Dad.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.233
But you might wanna
add some visual aids.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.400
It's just a little dry.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.903
Hmm, visual aids.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.781
Oh, that's how I can
spruce it up a little.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.408
Spruce! Spruce!

03:20.408 --> 03:21.910
Spa-ruce!

03:21.910 --> 03:24.663
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, very good then.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.791
<i>CHORUS:</i> (SINGING) <i>Doofenshmirtz
Evil Incorporated!</i>

03:29.417 --> 03:32.003
Good to see you,
Perry the Platypus.

03:32.003 --> 03:35.048
But you'll be lucky
to see anything after...

03:35.048 --> 03:37.801
Oop! Oh, I almost
used my final zinger

03:37.801 --> 03:39.803
before I even told you
my evil plan.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.012
Just put it out
of your mind.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.639
Bzzt. It's gone.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.433
Like, like you've been
zapped by a Mind-Zap-inator,

03:45.433 --> 03:47.435
Zapper-inator,
or something. Hmm.

03:47.435 --> 03:50.563
Anyway, you may be wondering why
you're in an ophthalmologist's chair.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.942
Well, it seems that I've come
into a bit of good fortune.

03:53.942 --> 03:58.280
Some technology of mine is being
used in eye examination equipment,

03:58.280 --> 04:00.073
and I've been getting
royalty checks.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.284
The extra money
is fine and all,

04:02.284 --> 04:03.910
but it really
chafes my hide

04:03.910 --> 04:06.705
that something I invented
is being used for good!

04:06.705 --> 04:08.081
(GROANS)

04:08.081 --> 04:12.419
So, so I invented
the Eye-Fog-inator!

04:12.419 --> 04:15.964
It will temporarily blur the
vision of whomever it hits.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.841
It will then force people to g0
out and get their eyes checked,

04:18.841 --> 04:20.719
and then I'll get
even more money,

04:20.719 --> 04:23.346
which I can then
spend on evil!

04:23.346 --> 04:25.724
So, you know,
it kind of evens out.

04:25.724 --> 04:29.811
And you, Perry the Platypus,
will be my first test subject.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.105
Okay, put your little
chin on the thing.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.982
Let, let me wipe
that off for you.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.608
Gets so greasy.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.486
Okay, lift your head a bit.
There, there we go. Perfect!

04:38.486 --> 04:39.988
Okay, now here's my zinger.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.615
You'll be lucky to see anything
after the Eye-Fog-ina...

04:42.615 --> 04:45.493
Ugh! It... You know, it worked
before when it was in context,

04:45.493 --> 04:47.579
but, but it just
sounds silly now.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.999
Okay, now, now you'll feel
a slight puff of air...

04:52.876 --> 04:54.627
Okay, and a blinding ray...

04:56.004 --> 04:57.630
So, di...did it work?

04:59.841 --> 05:01.760
Why are you
giving me the stink eye?

05:01.760 --> 05:02.844
Did it work or not?

05:05.513 --> 05:07.849
I guess I'll just have
to try it on myself.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.352
Okay,
three steps back and...

05:11.478 --> 05:12.854
Whoa!

05:12.854 --> 05:15.899
Whoa, I can see
that I cannot see.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.525
This...
It works!

05:17.525 --> 05:20.653
It works,
I consider this a success.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.030
Perry, Perry the Platypus,
where are you?

05:22.030 --> 05:23.156
Did you say something?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.741
Nice work, Baljeet!

05:24.741 --> 05:26.368
I found some slide rules

05:26.368 --> 05:28.036
from our World of
Calculations exhibit.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.872
I found some coat hangers from the
Leaning Tower of Closet Space,

05:30.872 --> 05:32.624
and an old college
sweatshirt.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.418
Cool! We can hit this
baby with the mega-sizer,

05:35.418 --> 05:37.045
and it'll make
a great parachute!

05:37.045 --> 05:39.506
I found these catering trays
from the giant picnic,

05:39.506 --> 05:41.633
and this parachute
from the drag race.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.510
Cool! We can shoot that
with the micr0-sizer,

05:43.510 --> 05:45.136
and it'll make
a great sweatshirt!

05:45.136 --> 05:47.472
All this stuff is gonna
work out great!

05:47.472 --> 05:49.516
It's a shame Perry isn't here to see it.
Here I am!

05:49.516 --> 05:51.893
And I brought some old
guitar strings to recycle.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.479
Wow! Uh, thanks. But...

05:54.479 --> 05:56.106
You meant Perry the
Platypus, didn't you?

05:56.106 --> 05:58.149
VVeH,yeah, but your
timing is perfect!

05:58.149 --> 05:59.859
We were just about
to start the song.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.404
Okay, try this on for size.

06:02.404 --> 06:05.865
<i>L' You take a bucket full of

I've got you now,
Perry the Platypus.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.713
Perry the Platypus, did you
get yourself upholstered?

07:03.214 --> 07:04.799
Yay!
Whoa!

07:04.799 --> 07:06.468
Oh, man!

07:06.468 --> 07:08.678
Actually, this is
way too tame.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.097
Hey! Crank it up to
double black diamond!

07:11.097 --> 07:12.474
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

07:14.559 --> 07:16.936
This parachute
smells funny.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.861
Nice re-purposing of Buford's
chewed gum collection!

07:24.861 --> 07:26.488
Whoo-hoo!

07:26.488 --> 07:29.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:29.240 --> 07:30.742
Whoo-hoo!

07:32.994 --> 07:34.579
That sure was great.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.247
But I wish Perry
was here for once.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.832
He would just love it!

07:38.750 --> 07:39.959
I do love it!

07:39.959 --> 07:41.628
I've never had
so much fun!

07:41.628 --> 07:44.005
Anyway, fellas,
I'm gonna hit the road.

07:44.005 --> 07:48.635
Well, he's no platypus,
but still a lovely fellow.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.846
You know, maybe I should've thought
before blurring my own vision!

07:51.846 --> 07:53.765
It was very
short-sighted of me.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.643
Hey, can you make that
digga-digga-digga-digga-digga sound for me...

07:56.643 --> 07:59.020
(GRUNTS) That was a
lucky kick, Perry...

07:59.020 --> 08:00.730
(YELLING)

08:00.730 --> 08:02.899
Wait! I just need to
blast myself again,

08:02.899 --> 08:06.027
and I'll clear my vision
and get the jump on him!

08:06.027 --> 08:07.529
(GROANS)

08:07.529 --> 08:09.155
Hey, hey,
YOU jumped on me!

08:09.155 --> 08:11.991
You used my own turn
of phrase against me.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.284
Wow, irony.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.536
(CLATTERING)

08:14.536 --> 08:16.663
Really?
A stack of buckets?

08:16.663 --> 08:20.291
That'll teach me to randomly stack
buckets in the center of my lab.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.252
Oh! Another reject.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.795
Here you go, Perry.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.548
Oh, there you are! What
are you doing up there?

08:26.548 --> 08:28.925
Oh, it's a bag of bread.
(CHUCKLES)

08:28.925 --> 08:31.553

what I'm about to do.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.781
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?

08:51.781 --> 08:53.700
I hate to interrupt
your day, honey,

08:53.700 --> 08:55.910
<i>but I need your help
with these pies.</i>

08:55.910 --> 08:58.705
<i>I'm so tired, I'm starting
to see the weirdest things.</i>

08:58.705 --> 09:00.707
Weird? Yes!
I'll be right home!

09:01.791 --> 09:04.085
Urn, that was
partially my fault.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.837
(YAWNS)

09:05.837 --> 09:08.214
The pies aren't the only

09:10.800 --> 09:13.219
Laka ullafallabalaka!

09:13.219 --> 09:16.097
I gotta get
out of here.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.349
Oh. That didn't go over
as well as I'd hoped.

09:18.349 --> 09:21.811
Hmm, perhaps I need
to spruce it up more!

09:21.811 --> 09:24.063
Spruce! Spr...

09:24.063 --> 09:25.231
Cw!

09:25.231 --> 09:28.610
I do believe
I've sprained my elbow.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.862
Maybe some fresh air
will help wake me...

09:30.862 --> 09:32.113
(SCREAMS)

09:32.113 --> 09:33.364
Hi, Morn
Phineas?

09:35.950 --> 09:37.452
Okay, found it!

09:37.452 --> 09:39.829
Okay, I just have to take
three steps back.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.122
One, two...

09:41.122 --> 09:45.126
Ow! Why do I keep
stacking buckets?

09:45.126 --> 09:46.753
Curse you,
Perry the Platypus!

09:51.758 --> 09:53.259
(SNIGGERS)

09:53.259 --> 09:54.385
This is gonna be epic!

09:54.385 --> 09:56.888
Okay, Morn! Here I am!

09:56.888 --> 09:58.890
Candace, do you see
what I'm seeing?

10:01.643 --> 10:04.646
I don't see anything.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.273
That's it!
I'm lying down.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.901
(SCREAMING)

10:09.901 --> 10:11.778
I can see everything
so well now!

10:11.778 --> 10:14.280
Yes, whoever invented those
gizmos inside that machine

10:14.280 --> 10:17.659
must be a person who's dedicated
his or her life to good.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.160
Oh, man!

10:19.160 --> 10:21.663
Ignore the upside-down man,
Balthazar.

Ornithorhynchan tribe.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.425
The Ornithorhynchans were a
platypus-worshipping society.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.427
Why is his arm in a sling?

10:36.427 --> 10:38.763
That's what bothers you
about this?

10:42.809 --> 10:44.811
That nap did me
a world of good!

10:44.811 --> 10:46.688
I feel so much better now.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.692
