our French Club trip.

01:01.166 --> 01:03.583

Let's go to the arcade

01:16.000 --> 01:18.333
Okay, let's talk about Paris.

01:18.375 --> 01:21.083
We need to make sure Dawn

01:18.375 --> 01:21.083
has enough money to go to Paris

01:21.125 --> 01:23.333
so we can turn her room

01:21.125 --> 01:23.333
into our man cave

01:23.375 --> 01:25.041
for seven whole days.

01:25.083 --> 01:26.709

We're gonna need a full day

01:26.750 --> 01:28.208

01:28.250 --> 01:30.667
But that's not gonna happen

01:30.709 --> 01:32.333
if she can't afford to go.

01:32.375 --> 01:34.458
That's why we're gonna win

01:32.375 --> 01:34.458
that hoverboard

01:34.500 --> 01:37.417
and sell it to help her

01:34.500 --> 01:37.417

01:37.458 --> 01:38.834
- I don't know.

01:38.875 --> 01:40.125
We're terrible at these games.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.834
Last time we played,

01:40.166 --> 01:41.834
we accidentally

01:41.875 --> 01:43.750
hit Dicky in the head

01:41.875 --> 01:43.750

01:54.917 --> 01:56.375
could get jobs here.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.458
- Clearly they need the help!

01:59.500 --> 02:02.000
- Well, it's a good idea. You

01:59.500 --> 02:02.000
both have restaurant experience.

02:02.041 --> 02:03.625

02:09.500 --> 02:11.709

02:11.750 --> 02:13.250
- That's not a bad idea.

02:13.291 --> 02:17.125
That waitress

02:13.291 --> 02:17.125
just got a $20 tip.

02:17.166 --> 02:20.250
- It's actually a great idea.

02:17.166 --> 02:20.250
A few weeks working here,

02:20.291 --> 02:21.875
and we'll make our Paris money

02:20.291 --> 02:21.875
in no time.

02:21.917 --> 02:23.542
We need to apply today.

02:23.583 --> 02:26.166
- This is ridiculous.

02:23.583 --> 02:26.166
Where is my sundae?

02:26.208 --> 02:27.333
I'm gonna complain

02:26.208 --> 02:27.333
to the manager.

02:27.375 --> 02:28.709
all: No.

02:28.750 --> 02:31.041
- Why not?

02:28.750 --> 02:31.041
It is my birthday!

02:32.709 --> 02:34.333

02:34.375 --> 02:35.834
and we don't want you

02:37.291 --> 02:38.959
it'll be extremely

02:37.291 --> 02:38.959

I could be a galactic princess.
