Captions made possible by
HOME BOX OFFICE

01:12.530 --> 01:16.728
A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, LP.

02:40.600 --> 02:43.296
SO, I SAY TO THIS GUY,
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING

02:43.300 --> 02:45.495
UNLESS YOU GIVE ME
AN ORDER NUMBER.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.195
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOU TAKING THAT

02:47.200 --> 02:48.428
TONE OF VOICE WITH ME.

02:48.430 --> 02:50.898
HE SAYS HE DOESN'T
HAVE AN ORDER NUMBER.

02:50.900 --> 02:53.391
AND I SAY, "WELL, YOU SHOULD
ALWAYS WRITE DOWN

02:53.400 --> 02:54.549
THE ORDER NUMBER."

02:54.560 --> 02:55.822
THEN HE GETS
ALL PISSY.

02:55.830 --> 02:58.890
SAYS HE WANTS TO SPEAK TO
THE PERSON HE ORDERED

02:58.900 --> 03:01.027
THE ASTORIA FLOOR LAMP
FROM AND I SAY,

03:01.030 --> 03:04.124
"WELL, DO YOU
REMEMBER HIS OR HER--"

03:04.130 --> 03:06.690
RIGHT, "NAME ?"

03:06.700 --> 03:08.793
AND HE SAYS,
"OF COURSE NOT".

03:08.800 --> 03:11.758
AND I SAY, "THEN I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T HELP YOU."

03:11.760 --> 03:14.820
THEN HE TELLS ME
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME

03:14.830 --> 03:16.525
HE HAD A PROBLEM
ORDERING FROM US.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.395
LAST CHRISTMAS
HE BOUGHT A CD HOLDER

03:18.400 --> 03:19.799
AND IT ARRIVED
ALL BROKEN,

03:19.800 --> 03:21.597
BUT WHEN WE TOLD HIM
TO SEND IT BACK,

03:21.600 --> 03:25.127
HE COULDN'T BECAUSE HE'D
THROWN AWAY THE BOX IT CAME IN.

03:27.260 --> 03:29.797
SO, I SAY,
"BOO-HOO, MISTER.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.119
AIN'T YOU
GOT IT BAD."

03:31.130 --> 03:33.598
AND HE SAYS, "I WANT TO
TALK TO YOUR SUPERVISOR."

03:36.500 --> 03:39.298
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
HIS HOURS ARE ONLY 8:30--"

04:06.560 --> 04:08.619
ACCORDING TO THE COUSIN
WHO ARRANGED THE FUNERAL.

04:08.630 --> 04:10.951
I BET HE WAS
ABUSING HER.

04:10.960 --> 04:14.555
OR MAYBE HE HAD SOME SICK
SEXUAL THING HE MADE HER DO.

04:14.560 --> 04:15.652
PLEASE STOP.

04:15.660 --> 04:17.423
AND YOU'RE WRONG.

04:17.430 --> 04:20.524
ALL SHE TOLD THE POLICE
WAS THAT HE WAS BORING.

04:22.030 --> 04:24.396
THAT'S IT,
THAT'S ALL SHE SAID ?

04:26.600 --> 04:28.818
THE SICK PART IS,
I UNDERSTAND IT.

04:28.830 --> 04:30.627
I DO TOO.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.894
SOMETIMES
I'M BORING.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.197
I AM TOO.

04:38.930 --> 04:41.649
SO, I SHOULD PROBABLY
BE AT BOTH INTAKES
WITH YOU THIS MORNING,

04:41.660 --> 04:44.493
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO DO
THE CASKET MEETING
PEOPLE YOURSELF

04:44.500 --> 04:46.252
BECAUSE I'M REALLY
BACKED UP DOWN HERE.

04:46.260 --> 04:47.659
DAVID, MAYBE
WE NEED TO

04:47.660 --> 04:51.323
THINK ABOUT FINDING
A REPLACEMENT FOR RICO.

04:51.330 --> 04:53.525
WHY ? WE'RE DOING
JUST FINE WITHOUT HIM.

04:53.530 --> 04:56.192
IT'S SAVING MONEY,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

04:58.130 --> 05:00.519
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU'D
LIKE TO SAY ABOUT MY WORK ?

05:00.530 --> 05:03.795
YOU DO A GREAT JOB WHEN
IT COMES TO THE PEOPLE

05:03.800 --> 05:05.722
WHO'VE HAD NICE,
PEACEFUL FAREWELLS.

05:05.730 --> 05:07.425
BUT THE BIG RECONSTRUCT IONS,
COME ON, DAVID,

05:07.430 --> 05:08.454
YOU'RE A LITTLE
OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

05:08.460 --> 05:10.348
I SEE, SO, THOSE WHO
CAN'T DO, CRITICIZE.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.499
WE'VE GOT A BODY IN THERE
THAT'S A PAGE ONE REWRITE.

05:12.500 --> 05:15.526
WE'VE GOT TWO MORE
COMING IN TODAY FROM THAT
NIGHTCLUB FIRE IN VALENCIA.

05:15.530 --> 05:16.827
HOW BAD WAS
THAT FIRE ?

05:16.830 --> 05:18.195
WELL, THIS IS WHERE
THEY ENDED UP.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.952
WELL, MAYBE
THE FAMILIES WANT--

05:19.960 --> 05:22.292
OPEN CASKETS, THEY ALREADY
PUT IN THE REQUESTS.

05:22.300 --> 05:25.258
I'LL PUT AN AD
IN THE PAPER TODAY.

05:25.260 --> 05:26.693
IT'S ALREADY
TAKEN CARE OF.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.588
I'VE SCHEDULED SOME INTERVIEWS
FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

05:32.830 --> 05:34.354
AS YOU CAN SEE
FROM MY RESUME,

05:34.360 --> 05:36.692
I'VE HAD THE
GOOD FORTUNE TO STUDY

05:36.700 --> 05:38.725
UNDER A VARIETY OF GIFI'ED
RESTORATIVE ARTISTS.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.197
OH, YOU WORKED OVER
AT HOPE VALLEY.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.020
I'VE KNOWN P.T.
FOR YEARS.

05:42.030 --> 05:43.691
OH.

05:43.700 --> 05:47.124
LOOK, THAT LAWSUIT
ABOUT THE UN-EMBALMED ARM

05:47.130 --> 05:48.722
WAS NOT MY FAULT.

05:48.730 --> 05:50.948
I TOOK THE FALL FOR SOME BITCH
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO

05:50.960 --> 05:53.997
COVER MY ASS
FOR LEAVING EARLY.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.057
SOMETIMES I WAKE UP
WITH A FEELING OF PANIC,

05:57.060 --> 05:59.392
LIKE MY HEART'S GONNA
BEAT RIGHT OUTI'A MY CHEST.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.220
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.152
BUT AFTER I SPEND
A FEW EXTRA HOURS IN BED

06:03.160 --> 06:04.525
AND DO
MY CHANTING,

06:04.530 --> 06:06.953
THE DARK TIME
USUALLY PASSES.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.553
I KNOW IT
SOUNDS FUNNY,

06:09.560 --> 06:12.120
BUT THE FIRST TIME
I EMBALMED SOMEONE,

06:12.130 --> 06:13.791
IT FELT LIKE I WAS
COMING HOME.

06:13.800 --> 06:17.554
I JUST KNEW THAT THIS IS
WHAT I WAS MEANT TO DO.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.323
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
FUNNY AT ALL.

06:19.330 --> 06:21.651
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY
INTIMATE ABOUT IT.

06:21.660 --> 06:23.548
I'M THE LAST
PERSON ON EARTH

06:23.560 --> 06:26.028
WHO GETS TO KNOW
THESE PEOPLE.

06:27.900 --> 06:31.791
ANYWAY, I GUESS I TAKE
WHAT I DO VERY SERIOUSLY.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.394
WELL, I HAVE NO
FURTHER QUESTIONS.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.651
ME, NEITHER.

06:35.660 --> 06:37.525
THANKS FOR
COMING IN, ANGELA.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.349
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.918
GREAT.

06:42.530 --> 06:44.293
OH.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.927
IT WAS VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU.

06:45.930 --> 06:47.329
IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU.

06:47.330 --> 06:48.319
YEAH.

06:48.330 --> 06:49.752
OKAY.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.593
I'LL WAIT AN HOUR
BEFORE I CALL HER.

06:54.600 --> 06:55.999
WE DON'T WANT TO
LOOK DESPERATE.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.958
JUST FIND OUT IF
SHE CAN START TOMORROW.

07:07.560 --> 07:14.625
I'VE GOT A LOT
OF LIVIN' TO DO

07:14.630 --> 07:16.757
I'M GONNA BREAK OUT,
GONNA GO WILD

07:16.760 --> 07:18.022
HAVE MY WAY

07:18.030 --> 07:23.229
I MAY BREAK
A HEART A DAY

07:24.160 --> 07:25.718
LIFE'S A BALL

07:25.730 --> 07:27.755
IF ONLY YOU KNOW IT

07:27.760 --> 07:32.424
AND IT'S ALL
JUST WAITING FOR YOU

07:33.600 --> 07:35.352
YOU'RE ALIVE

07:35.360 --> 07:37.419
SO, COME ON
AND SHOW IT

07:37.430 --> 07:38.590
( Ruth )
DAVID !

07:38.600 --> 07:41.228
DAVID !

07:43.100 --> 07:44.727
WHY ARE YOU STANDING
THERE LIKE THAT ?

07:50.330 --> 07:52.491
ISN'T A PERSON
ALLOWED TO THINK ?

08:07.630 --> 08:10.292
YOU'RE GONNA WISH
YOU'D GOTI'EN HIGH WITH ME.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.052
I TOLD YOU, I'M NEVER
GE'I'I'ING HIGH AGAIN.

08:12.060 --> 08:14.392
OH, DOESN'T BILLY
LOOK GREAT ?

08:14.400 --> 08:17.096
SO HANDSOME
AND CONFIDENT.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.557
YO, BILLY !

08:21.030 --> 08:22.395
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR ONE MOMENT ?

08:22.400 --> 08:23.822
THANK YOU GUYS
SO MUCH FOR COMING.

08:23.830 --> 08:25.127
I REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.688
THANK GOD
YOU'RE HERE, BRENDA.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.292
MY MOUTH IS REALLY DRY
AND IS MY BREATH BAD ?

08:28.300 --> 08:29.824
IT'S FINE.

08:29.830 --> 08:32.151
OKAY, SO TRUTH,
IS THIS SHOW ANY GOOD ?

08:32.160 --> 08:33.696
OR IS IT JUST
PRETENTIOUS BULLSHIT ?

08:33.700 --> 08:35.656
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE,
IT'S HARD TO SEE THE PICTURES.

08:35.660 --> 08:37.821
THIS IS BILLY'S
BEST WORK EVER.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.195
VERY DISTURBING.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.258
REALLY ?

08:40.260 --> 08:43.058
IAM SO PROUD
OF YOU, GOD !

08:45.730 --> 08:47.618
WHY IS MY
MOTHER HERE ?

08:47.630 --> 08:49.598
OH, GOD.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.319
I INVITED HER AS PART OF
MY ONGOING CAMPAIGN

08:52.330 --> 08:53.888
TO GET HER
TO LIKE ME.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.959
I DIDN'T THINK
SHE'D ACTUALLY TURN UP.

08:59.130 --> 09:01.655
SOME STRANGER JUST
RUBBED MY ASS.

09:01.660 --> 09:04.322
ISN'T THIS
FABULOUS ?

09:04.330 --> 09:07.049
OH, BILLY,
DARLING !

09:11.000 --> 09:12.797
THAN KS, MOM.

09:14.160 --> 09:17.823
YOU CAN'T KEEP HIM
TO YOURSELF ALL THE TIME.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.920
OKAY, NO OFFENSE.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.091
BUT YOUR FAMILY IS FUCKED UP
BEYOND COMPREHENSION.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.727
SHE IS COMPLETELY
TANKED.

09:26.730 --> 09:29.699
I BROUGHT SOMEONE,
I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

09:29.700 --> 09:30.951
HEY, NIKOLAI.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.496
HELLO, NATE,
HOW ARE YOU ?

09:32.500 --> 09:33.524
THIS IS BRENDA.

09:33.530 --> 09:34.656
GOOD EVENING.

09:34.660 --> 09:36.127
HELLO, DEAR.

09:36.130 --> 09:38.553
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU,
MRS. FISHER.

09:38.560 --> 09:39.891
WHERE'S HIRAM ?

09:39.900 --> 09:42.619
HE'S VISITING HIS SON
IN PORTLAND.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.657
I'M SERIOUS,
DARLING.

09:44.660 --> 09:46.924
THIS NEW STUFF
IS REALLY...

09:46.930 --> 09:47.999
VISCERAL.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.956
NOT AT ALL LEFT-BRAINED
LIKE YOUR FATHER.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.598
YEAH.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.090
HEY, SO,
WHERE IS DAD ?

09:53.100 --> 09:56.456
OH, HONEY, BERN
SENDS HIS REGRETS.

09:56.460 --> 09:58.121
HE'S JUST HEARTSICK.

09:58.130 --> 10:01.190
UNFORTUNATELY HE'S TREATING
ONE OF HIS PATIENTS

10:01.200 --> 10:04.829
WHO'S UNDERGOING A COMPLETE
PSYCHOTIC BREAK AT THE MOMENT.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.795
GEE, THAT ALWAYS
SEEMS TO HAPPEN

10:07.800 --> 10:09.358
WHENEVER THERE'S SOMETHING
IMPORTANT IN MY LIFE.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.419
I GUESS THAT'S JUST
TYPICAL BERNARD--

10:11.430 --> 10:13.455
EXCUSE ME, BURR-NURD
CHENOWITH BEHAVIOR.

10:13.460 --> 10:15.894
PRETENTIOUS DICK.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.959
NOW, YOU JUST HUSH.

10:19.830 --> 10:21.593
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD
BE PAINTINGS.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.227
I COULD TAKE
PHOTOGRAPHS.

10:23.230 --> 10:25.357
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THEY'D BE ANY GOOD.

10:25.360 --> 10:29.649
MRS. FISHER, I'VE NEVER SEEN
YOU HAVING THIS MUCH FUN.

10:31.060 --> 10:32.220
OH, NO, IT'S GREAT.

10:32.230 --> 10:35.722
IAM HAVING FUN
JUST WATCHING YOU.

10:39.100 --> 10:42.354
HEY, MR. SEA'I'I'LE
CO-OP HIPPIE BOY.

10:44.300 --> 10:46.951
OH, MARGARET CHENOWITH,
WHO ARE YOU ?

10:46.960 --> 10:48.723
RUTH FISHER.

10:48.730 --> 10:50.152
NATE'S MOTHER.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.754
THAT EXPLAINS WHY YOU'RE
LOOKING AT ME LIKE I JUST TOOK

10:52.760 --> 10:55.058
A GIANT DUMP ON
YOUR FRONT LAWN.

10:55.060 --> 10:56.493
MOM, IF I'D KNOWN YOU WERE
PU'I'I'ING ON A SHOW TONIGHT,

10:56.500 --> 10:58.923
I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT TICKETS
FOR ALL MY FRIENDS.

10:58.930 --> 11:01.421
GOODY, THERE'S
DR. FEINBERG.

11:01.430 --> 11:04.092
WHAT IS HE
DOING HERE ?

11:04.100 --> 11:06.125
I INVITED HIM.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.757
GARETH FEINBERG, THE GUY
WHO WROTE THE BOOK ?

11:07.760 --> 11:08.852
YEAH.

11:08.860 --> 11:11.055
HE WROTE "CHARLOTTE FUCKING
LIGHT AND DARK".

11:11.060 --> 11:14.359
HE'S A FUCKING EVIL DEAD FISH
OF A FUCKING NAZI FUCK.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.759
DARLING.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.557
TRY NOT TO ACT
SO ADOLESCENT.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.096
IT ONLY MAKES
YOU LOOK BAD.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.328
AS OPPOSED TO BEING
DRUNK IN PUBLIC

11:20.330 --> 11:21.592
AND SLOBBERING
ALL OVER MY BOYFRIEND

11:21.600 --> 11:23.852
WHO, BY THE WAY,
IS COMPLETELY NOT INTERESTED.

11:23.860 --> 11:25.498
ISN'T THIS FUN ?

11:25.500 --> 11:28.526
BILLY, BILLY, BILLY.

11:28.530 --> 11:31.055
IT'S QUITE
POWERFUL STUFF.

11:31.060 --> 11:33.028
IT'S POTENT.

11:33.030 --> 11:34.327
( laughing )

11:34.330 --> 11:37.197
THAT'S A WORD DR. FEINBERG
LIKES TO USE A LOT.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.296
BRENDA, I SEE A LOT OF YOU
IN THESE PHOTOGRAPHS.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.951
HELLO, GARETH.

11:45.030 --> 11:46.019
MARGARET.

11:46.030 --> 11:47.395
EW.

11:49.630 --> 11:51.154
DOES THIS HAVE
A THEME, DARLING ?

11:51.160 --> 11:53.151
I KNOW YOU LIKE YOUR THINGS
TO HAVE A THEME, DON'T YOU ?

11:53.160 --> 11:55.025
MOTHER, NOTHING IS MORE
TEDIOUS THAN WHEN YOU

11:55.030 --> 11:56.725
LOOK FOR MEANING
IN MY WORK.

11:56.730 --> 11:59.051
I DON'T NEED YOUR
FUCKING APPROVAL.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.256
EXCUSE ME.

12:07.500 --> 12:08.626
ISN'T THAT
BEAUTIFUL ?

12:08.630 --> 12:10.791
YEAH, IT IS.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.256
HE'S GOOD.

12:12.260 --> 12:15.297
YEAH, HE IS
REALLY GOOD.

12:15.300 --> 12:18.690
I ONLY WISH
HE BELIEVED THAT.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.555
THIS ONE'S GOT
REAL ATTITUDE.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.790
OH, MY GOD.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.427
THE LIGHT'S
SPECTACULAR.

12:34.430 --> 12:37.524
BRENDA, THAT IS A PICTURE
OF ME URINATING ON A WALL.

12:37.530 --> 12:39.828
I REALIZE THAT.

12:39.830 --> 12:40.990
HEY, WHAT DO
YOU THINK ?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.592
WHAT, SO, NOW
YOU'RE STALKING ME ?

12:42.600 --> 12:44.454
NO, NO, I JUST HAPPENED
TO SEE YOU ONE DAY

12:44.460 --> 12:45.757
WHEN I WAS OUT
TAKING PICTURES.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.125
SO, I FOLLOWED YOU
FOR A COUPLE OF MILES.

12:47.130 --> 12:48.620
OH, YEAH, YOU WERE JUST
OUT TAKING PICTURES ?

12:48.630 --> 12:50.222
YOU LIVE IN
FUCKING VENICE.

12:50.230 --> 12:51.697
THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU
TO BE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:51.700 --> 12:52.997
WOW.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.627
YOU REALLY THINK THE WORLD
REVOLVES AROUND YOU, DON'T YOU ?

12:54.630 --> 12:57.098
BREN, WOULD YOU TELL HIM, PLEASE
THIS ISN'T ABOUT HIM ?

13:00.660 --> 13:03.891
IT'S WHAT
BILLY DOES.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.551
HE TAKES PICTURES OF PEOPLE
WHEN THEY'RE OFF GUARD.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.596
HE'S GOT A TALENT,
IT'S ART.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.329
NO, IT'S FUCKED !

13:15.860 --> 13:17.691
THANKS A LOT.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.554
LOOK !

13:28.560 --> 13:31.529
THAT'S YOUR SON
PISSING AGAINST A WALL !

13:33.930 --> 13:36.296
SO, I SHOULD JUST LET HIM
HUMILIATE ME WHENEVER HE WANTS ?

13:36.300 --> 13:38.621
OH, GOD, NATE,
DON'T MAKE THIS ABOUT YOU.

13:38.630 --> 13:40.325
WELL, WHY THE
FUCK NOT ?

13:40.330 --> 13:41.752
THIS IS ABOUT ME.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.398
YOU CERTAINLY MAKE ENOUGH
STUFF ALL ABOUT YOU.

13:45.860 --> 13:48.021
WHO GOT HURT,
WHO DIED ?

13:50.260 --> 13:52.490
YOU DON'T THINK I HAVE A RIGHT
TO NOT BE SPIED UPON ?

13:52.500 --> 13:56.049
YOU'RE TALKING TO SOMEBODY WHO
WAS SPIED ON HER WHOLE LIFE.

13:56.060 --> 13:59.518
GOD, BILLY IS SEVERELY
FUCKED UP, BREN.

13:59.530 --> 14:01.157
I DON'T LIKE BEING
STALKED BY A PSYCHO.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.752
BILLY IS
NOT PSYCHOTIC !

14:02.760 --> 14:04.398
HE HAS A DISEASE !

14:04.400 --> 14:06.356
HE'S FINE WHEN HE
TAKES HIS MEDS.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.123
YEAH, WELL,
WHEN THE FUCK IS THAT ?

14:13.360 --> 14:16.056
LOOK, HAS HE EVER
DONE ANYTHING WEIRD ?

14:16.060 --> 14:18.722
UH, YEAH,
HE'S BIPOLAR.

14:18.730 --> 14:21.198
HIS WHOLE LIFE
HE'S BEEN WEIRD.

14:21.200 --> 14:25.398
HAS HE EVER DONE
ANYTHING DANGEROUS ?

14:26.230 --> 14:28.721
OH, GOD...

14:28.730 --> 14:30.891
NATE, NO.

14:32.360 --> 14:36.091
THE ONLY PERSON BILLY WOULD
EVER BE A THREAT TO...

14:36.100 --> 14:37.852
IS HIMSELF.

14:37.860 --> 14:39.657
HAS HE EVER
TRIED TO--

14:39.660 --> 14:41.298
YES.

14:42.830 --> 14:44.195
WHEN I WAS 18.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.659
I WENT TO EUROPE
FOR THREE MONTHS.

14:50.660 --> 14:53.754
IT WAS THIS BIG REWARD FOR ME
WINNING A SCHOLARSHIP TO YALE.

14:55.730 --> 14:58.290
WHEN I GOT BACK TO L.A.,
MY MOTHER WAS AT THE AIRPORT.

14:58.300 --> 15:02.020
SHE TOLD ME THAT BILLY
HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE.

15:03.230 --> 15:08.156
MY WHOLE LIFE JUST COLLAPSED
IN ON ITSELF IN THAT MOMENT.

15:10.230 --> 15:12.949
OF COURSE, SHE MEANT TO
SAY THAT BILLY HAD...

15:12.960 --> 15:15.224
TRIED TO
COMMIT SUICIDE.

15:15.230 --> 15:17.221
SHE WAS DRUNK,
OR ELSE...

15:17.230 --> 15:20.654
IT WAS
A FREUDIAN SLIP.

15:23.330 --> 15:24.957
YOU NEVER WENT
TO YALE.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.428
BILLY WAS IN A HOSPITAL
IN PASADENA.

15:27.430 --> 15:31.753
I TOOK SOME CLASSES
AT U.C.L.A. IN THE SPRING.

15:31.760 --> 15:35.196
THEN IN THE FALL,

15:35.200 --> 15:37.589
HE WAS DIAGNOSED
MANIC DEPRESSIVE,

15:37.600 --> 15:39.022
WHICH KICKS IN
IN ADOLESCENCE,

15:39.030 --> 15:40.429
SO, IT PROBABLY HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME

15:40.430 --> 15:41.954
GETTING THE SCHOLARSHIP.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.793
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY PRESSURED
YOU INTO SACRIFICING YOUR LIFE

15:44.800 --> 15:46.222
FOR YOUR BROTHER.

15:46.230 --> 15:47.652
NOBODY PRESSURED ME.

15:49.260 --> 15:51.728
I WANTED TO STAY.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.525
( Nate )
MORNING.

16:00.530 --> 16:02.851
PEE ON ANY
WALLS LATELY ?

16:02.860 --> 16:04.396
SHUT UP.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.089
SO, MOM, WHAT'S WITH
YOU AND NIKOLAI ?

16:09.100 --> 16:11.489
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:13.160 --> 16:14.422
AND DAVE...

16:14.430 --> 16:16.751
WHAT'D YOU DO
LAST NIGHT ?

16:16.760 --> 16:17.954
NOTHING.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.757
SATURDAY NIGHT,
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT--

16:20.860 --> 16:23.624
PERSON YOU'RE
SEEING ?

16:25.130 --> 16:27.997
UH, THAT PERSON IS
NO LONGER IN THE PICTURE.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.297
SORRY TO HEAR IT.

16:29.300 --> 16:32.098
WHAT ABOUT YOU ?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.025
ARE YOU DATING
ANYBODY ?

16:35.030 --> 16:36.156
NO.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.627
IF YOU'RE
DATING SOMEONE,

16:37.630 --> 16:39.393
YOU DON'T NEED TO HIDE HIM
FROM US LIKE WE'RE LEPERS.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.958
I'M NOT
DATING ANYONE.

16:40.960 --> 16:44.054
I'VE JUST BEEN HANGING OUT
A LOT WITH SOMEBODY.

16:44.060 --> 16:45.948
WHO IS
THIS PERSON ?

16:48.960 --> 16:50.757
NOBODY.

16:52.860 --> 16:55.397
DAVID, I'M READY
TO GO TO CHURCH.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.295
THAN KS, GUYS.

17:04.730 --> 17:06.698
Hey, Joey,
the kid's ready.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.099
So am I.

17:12.930 --> 17:16.457
This is the most terrifying
shower scene since "Psycho".

17:17.660 --> 17:19.696
(video game sounds )

17:20.630 --> 17:23.656
THAT FOOTBALL GAME USED TO MAKE
THIS REALLY OBNOXIOUS NOISE

17:23.660 --> 17:25.298
WHEN YOU SCORED
A TOUCHDOWN.

17:27.100 --> 17:29.751
DO YOU WANT TO SHOW ME
HOW TO PLAY IT ?

17:29.760 --> 17:32.149
NO.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.792
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S THIS...

17:36.800 --> 17:40.952
THERE'S THIS LITTLE KID
NEXT DOOR AND...

17:40.960 --> 17:43.349
I MEAN, THE ONLY TOY HE'S GOT IS
LIKE THIS STUPID MOUSETRAP GAME

17:43.360 --> 17:45.294
FROM WHEN HIS
MOM WAS A KID.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.027
MAYBE...

17:48.030 --> 17:50.021
YOU KNOW, HE'D WANT
SOME OF THESE.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.552
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

18:02.560 --> 18:05.154
WHY WOULD YOU WASTE YOUR SUNDAY
IN HERE WATCHING TELEVISION ?

18:10.600 --> 18:11.919
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?

18:13.530 --> 18:15.555
UMM...

18:15.560 --> 18:18.097
I THOUGHT THAT
TONY RECHNER NEXT DOOR
MIGHT WANT SOME OF THESE.

18:22.230 --> 18:24.027
JUST KEEP YOUR
HANDS OFF THEM.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.226
SHE DOESN'T EVEN LOOK ME
IN THE EYES ANYMORE.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.056
C'MON, I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING FUNNY.

18:45.060 --> 18:46.493
COME ON.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.819
COME ON.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.123
WE'RE GOING ON
A FIELD TRIP ?

18:58.200 --> 19:00.020
THIS IS LIKE
THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

19:00.030 --> 19:02.692
I AM SO EXCITED.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.691
OH, AND...

19:04.700 --> 19:06.918
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE
IN ADVANCE

19:06.930 --> 19:09.091
BECAUSE I HAD CALAMARI
LAST NIGHT FOR DINNER.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.658
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN ?

19:10.660 --> 19:12.355
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
THIS IS THE ONE TIME

19:12.360 --> 19:13.827
WHERE THE STRONG
SMELL OF FORMALDEHYDE

19:13.830 --> 19:16.355
REALLY COMES
IN HAN DY.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.291
SO, THEN I SAID
TO HIM

19:21.300 --> 19:23.256
"I DON'T CARE IF YOU HAVE
A LOW SPERM COUNT.

19:23.260 --> 19:25.399
"I MEAN, I'LL JUST SHOVE
A TURKEY BASTER UP THERE

19:25.400 --> 19:26.890
IF I HAVE TO."

19:26.900 --> 19:29.289
I WANT TO HAVE A CHILD
BEFORE I TURN 40.

19:29.300 --> 19:30.858
THAT'S FAIR, RIGHT ?

19:30.860 --> 19:32.327
HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:32.330 --> 19:33.695
HI.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.622
HOW WAS CHURCH ?

19:35.630 --> 19:37.495
NATE TOLD ME
YOU'RE A DEACON.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.491
THAT'S ADORABLE.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.954
I SEE YOU'VE MADE
YOURSELF AT HOME.

19:47.960 --> 19:51.657
ANGELA DOESN'T LIKE
TO FEEL CONSTRAINED.

19:51.660 --> 19:54.254
YOU KNOW, MY GLANDS
GO DOUBLE-TIME.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.296
I FIND IF I WEAR
TOO MUCH WHILE I WORK,

19:56.300 --> 19:57.449
I GET ALL...

19:57.460 --> 19:58.597
PITTED.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.399
ANGELA...

20:08.400 --> 20:10.493
WE'RE SORT OF USED TO A MORE
PROFESSIONAL APPEARANCE

20:10.500 --> 20:12.024
AROUND HERE.

20:12.030 --> 20:13.327
GIVE ME
A BREAK, DAVID.

20:13.330 --> 20:14.649
THEY'RE JUST
NIPPLES.

20:14.660 --> 20:17.356
I MEAN, WE'VE ALL SEEN 'EM,
WE'VE ALL TOUCHED 'EM.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.896
WE'VE ALL
SUCKED ON 'EM.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.959
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THIS GUY
IS GONNA BE LYING IN THE CASKET

20:20.960 --> 20:22.359
AND PEOPLE ARE
GONNA BE SAYING,

20:22.360 --> 20:24.828
"OH, MY GOD, THE EMBALMER'S
NIPPLES WERE HARD."

20:24.830 --> 20:26.422
THERE GONNA BE SAYING,

20:26.430 --> 20:28.250
"OH, MY GOD, HOW DID THEY
PUT HIS FACE BACK TOGETHER

20:28.260 --> 20:30.899
AFTER HE WENT THROUGH
THE GODDAMN WINDSHIELD ?"

20:32.930 --> 20:34.989
I TOLD FATHER JACK
I'D HELP HIM WITH

20:35.000 --> 20:36.922
THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION
DOWNTOWN.

20:36.930 --> 20:39.421
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOUR FIRST DAY WAS GOING OKAY.

20:39.430 --> 20:40.692
THAN KS.

20:40.700 --> 20:43.225
I'M ALL GASSY,
BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

20:43.230 --> 20:45.858
ANGELA HAD CALAMARI
LAST NIGHT.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.850
BOY, HE'S A BARREL
OF LAUGHS.

20:50.860 --> 20:52.851
( laughing )

20:53.700 --> 20:56.089
IT'S HARD WHEN A NEW PERSON
COMES INTO A SITUATION.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.954
IT THROWS
EVERYTHING OFF BALANCE.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.953
BREN, I'M NOT THREATENED
BY YOUR BOYFRIEND.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.791
OH, YEAH ?

21:03.800 --> 21:07.054
YOUR BEHAVIOR CONSISTENTLY
COMMUNICATES OTHERWISE.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.996
OKAY, YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE THE PICTURE
OUT OF THE SHOW, FINE.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.797
BUT PLEASE DON'T SPOUT
PSYCHO-BABBLE AT ME

21:13.800 --> 21:15.427
LIKE FUCKING
MARGARET AND BERNARD.

21:15.430 --> 21:16.852
YOU'RE LIKE,
BECOMING THEM.

21:16.860 --> 21:17.997
FUCK YOU !

21:18.000 --> 21:19.649
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU DID WAS WRONG.

21:19.660 --> 21:21.355
THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T
SHOW IT TO ME BEFORE.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.089
WHY ARE YOU MAKING SUCH
A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS ?

21:23.100 --> 21:24.897
BECAUSE
I LOVE HIM !

21:29.930 --> 21:33.320
YOU'RE FUCKING WITH MY LIFE,
BILLY, AND IT'S NOT FAIR.

21:33.330 --> 21:35.218
YOU HAVE TO STOP.

21:36.430 --> 21:38.125
OR WHAT ?

21:38.130 --> 21:38.949
GODDAMNIT, BILLY !

21:38.960 --> 21:40.496
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU,

21:40.500 --> 21:42.798
YOU LIKE FUCKING WITH
MY BRAIN LIKE FEINBERG ?!

21:54.960 --> 21:56.427
THANK YOU.

21:56.430 --> 21:57.795
YOU'RE WELCOME.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.528
CAN I GET YOU
ANYTHING ELSE ?

22:02.530 --> 22:05.624
I CAN ALWAYS USE
A GOOD BLOW JOB...

22:09.600 --> 22:12.922
HEY, DO I GET
MY FUCKING LUNCH OR NOT ?

22:16.800 --> 22:19.052
I'M GOING TO GET
A DRINK OF WATER.

22:21.830 --> 22:23.354
MELINDA DANER,

22:23.360 --> 22:25.294
MARK WHITMAN...

22:25.300 --> 22:27.723
DARRYL HEINZ,

22:27.730 --> 22:29.698
KEITH CHARLES.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.895
OKAY, WELL, JUST TELL
THEM WE'LL MEET THEM

22:31.900 --> 22:33.754
AT THE USUAL CORNER
ON TUESDAY.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.296
HI, TRACY.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.097
OH, HI, DAVID.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.227
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ?

22:39.230 --> 22:40.822
FINE.

22:40.830 --> 22:42.525
I LOVE YOUR
NEW HAIR.

22:42.530 --> 22:44.748
WHAT ARE YOU
WORKING ON ?

22:44.760 --> 22:48.753
ST. STEPHEN'S IS SENDING
OVER SOME VOLUNTEERS

22:48.760 --> 22:50.625
TO HELP OUT NEXT WEEK.

22:50.630 --> 22:53.599
SOMEONE TOLD ME THAT YOU
USED TO GO TO ST. STEPHEN'S.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.818
NOT THAT I'VE BEEN ASKING
AROUND ABOUT YOU.

22:55.830 --> 22:57.593
IT JUST CAME
UP NATURALLY.

22:57.600 --> 22:58.851
SO, DID YOU ?

22:58.860 --> 23:00.327
GO THERE, I MEAN.

23:00.330 --> 23:01.922
YEAH, JUST FOR
A FEW MONTHS LAST YEAR.

23:01.930 --> 23:04.524
THEY'RE A VERY
PROGRESSIVE CHURCH.

23:04.530 --> 23:06.293
YES, THEY ARE.

23:11.560 --> 23:14.723
THE GUY WHO TOOK THESE
IS A TOTAL PSYCHO.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.094
GOOD.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.752
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING
IF WE WANT TO SEE THAT MOVIE.

23:25.760 --> 23:29.321
I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET HOME.

23:29.330 --> 23:31.491
AND CHECK ON MY MOM.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.923
I'M SURE
SHE'S DOING FINE.

23:38.100 --> 23:39.522
I'M SORRY.

23:39.530 --> 23:41.691
IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS
DYING TO SEE A MOVIE.

23:41.700 --> 23:43.952
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

23:47.530 --> 23:49.498
I'M SORRY...

23:49.500 --> 23:52.492
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN US.

23:52.500 --> 23:56.550
I NEVER MEANT FOR THOSE ASSHOLES
TO WRITE SHIT ON YOUR CAR.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.797
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TOLD ANDY ABOUT US.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.257
I WAS JUST
BEING STUPID.

24:02.260 --> 24:06.026
THAT WAS ME BEING
REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY STUPID AND...

24:09.600 --> 24:11.659
I'M SORRY.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.898
WELL, THANK YOU.

24:34.860 --> 24:37.556
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.449
ALL I'M SAYING IS
I SAT AROUND LAST WEEK

24:40.460 --> 24:42.951
IN THAT STUPID GET-UP
YOU WANTED ME TO WEAR

24:42.960 --> 24:44.825
AND HAD TO SAY
ALL THIS

24:44.830 --> 24:46.889
DADDY THIS AND
DADDY THAT BULLSHIT.

24:46.900 --> 24:49.994
WHEN I TELL YOU, I KEEP
READING THESE ARTICLES

24:50.000 --> 24:51.752
ABOUT HAVING THIS
ONE-HOUR ORGASM,

24:51.760 --> 24:54.593
WELL, THE LEAST YOU COULD DO
IS TRY TO HELP ME HAVE ONE.

24:54.600 --> 24:57.228
WELL, I'M SORRY THAT
MEN CAN'T HAVE IT.

24:57.230 --> 24:59.425
BUT SINCE YOU GUYS GET TO HAVE
EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE PLANET,

24:59.430 --> 25:01.398
IT SEEMS LIKE
A FAIR TRADE-OFF.

25:02.530 --> 25:03.554
FINE.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.096
GOODBYE.

25:07.730 --> 25:09.254
YOU KNOW...

25:09.260 --> 25:11.057
ANGELA, MY BROTHER
LIKES A CERTAIN DECORUM

25:11.060 --> 25:14.598
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING
WITH SOMEONE'S LOVED ONE.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.227
YEAH ?

25:16.230 --> 25:19.597
THE PERSONAL CALLS ARE
A PROBABLY LITTLE UNCOOL.

25:19.600 --> 25:22.023
OH, RIGHT, GOT IT.

25:22.030 --> 25:23.657
I WON'T DO IT
WHEN HE'S AROUND.

25:24.130 --> 25:25.722
( phone )

25:27.400 --> 25:28.628
HELLO ?

25:30.360 --> 25:31.554
HEY.

25:33.560 --> 25:34.754
REALLY ?

25:34.760 --> 25:36.398
WHY DON'T YOU
WANT ME TO COME OVER ?

25:36.400 --> 25:39.119
DAMNIT, BRENDA,
YOU ALWAYS DO THIS.

25:39.130 --> 25:40.449
YOU'RE SHUTTING
ME OUT.

25:40.460 --> 25:43.099
THE PISSING THING IS
NO LONGER AN ISSUE, I SWEAR.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.898
LOOK, MAYBE YOU'D FEEL
BETTER IF I CAME OVER.

25:45.900 --> 25:49.222
ALRIGHT, FINE,
WHATEVER, FINE.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.920
WHOO !

25:53.930 --> 25:55.750
GIRLFRIEND TROUBLE ?

25:55.760 --> 25:57.057
NOT REALLY TROUBLE.

25:57.060 --> 25:58.288
JUST TELL ME WHAT
THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT

25:58.300 --> 26:00.621
AND I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT TO SAY TO FIX IT.

26:00.630 --> 26:02.257
I MEAN, TRUST ME
THIS IS MY THING.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.454
WE DIDN'T
HAVE A FIGHT.

26:03.460 --> 26:04.893
SHE JUST...

26:04.900 --> 26:08.358
PULLS AWAY FROM ME
AT THE WEIRDEST TIMES.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.419
MAYBE SHE
SENSES THAT...

26:11.430 --> 26:13.751
YOU'RE PULLING AWAY,

26:13.760 --> 26:15.421
SO, SHE JUST
DOES IT FIRST.

26:15.430 --> 26:18.297
MAYBE YOU SHOULD MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

26:18.300 --> 26:19.494
SHOOT.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.752
I GUESS THIS MEANS I CAN'T
ASK ABOUT THE PISSING ?

26:21.760 --> 26:24.593
'CAUSE I HAD AN EX
WHO WANTED TO PEE ON ME.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.397
AND I WASN'T
GROSSED OUT.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.391
I MEAN, I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS KIND OF SILLY,

26:28.400 --> 26:29.856
BUT THAT'S ME.

26:50.800 --> 26:54.554
THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME
TO THE ART GALLERY LAST NIGHT.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.199
I THOUGHT YOU HATED
THOSE PICTURES.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.292
NO, NO...

26:58.300 --> 27:01.098
IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T
LIKE THEM, THAT'S ALL.

27:01.100 --> 27:03.751
BUT IT WAS NICE TO BE
SPENDING TIME WITH YOU.

27:03.760 --> 27:07.696
I MEAN, OUTSIDE OF
WORKING TOGETHER.

27:09.660 --> 27:11.821
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
TO DINNER SOME TIME ?

27:11.830 --> 27:13.297
IS THAT
LIKE A...

27:13.300 --> 27:14.619
DATE ?

27:14.630 --> 27:16.450
OF COURSE NOT.

27:16.460 --> 27:19.099
GOOD, I PICK YOU UP
TOMORROW NIGHT, 8:00.

27:25.430 --> 27:26.692
I DON'T WANT
TO GO, OKAY ?

27:26.700 --> 27:28.099
JUST STOP ASKING ME.

27:28.100 --> 27:29.226
OKAY, FINE.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.891
I WAS ONLY INVITING YOU
TO BE NICE.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.322
BESIDES NOBODY EVEN
WANTS YOU THERE

27:32.330 --> 27:34.389
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN ACTING
SO FUCKING WEIRD LATELY.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.424
GABE ?

27:36.700 --> 27:39.191
WE HAVE TO BE
SOMEPLACE.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.258
GET LOST,
MORTICIA.

27:40.260 --> 27:42.057
SHUT UP,
PEANUT TESTICLE.

27:44.500 --> 27:45.558
FUCK OFF,

27:45.560 --> 27:46.891
BOTH OF YOU.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.224
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM ?

27:50.230 --> 27:51.322
NOTHIN'...

27:51.330 --> 27:53.491
HE WANTS ME TO GO TO
THIS PARTY TOMORROW.

27:53.500 --> 27:54.922
I'M JUST NOT
IN THE MOOD.

27:54.930 --> 27:57.592
WE CAN DO SOMETHING
IF YOU WANT.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.488
ACTUALLY I GOTTA
GO TO BARSTOW TOMORROW

27:59.500 --> 28:01.058
AND SPEND THE NIGHT
AT MY DAD'S.

28:01.060 --> 28:04.052
I GOTTA ASK HIM
FOR MONEY FOR MY MOM.

28:04.060 --> 28:06.893
NOT THAT HE'S GONNA
GIVE IT TO ME, BUT.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.926
DO YOU WANT
COMPANY ?

28:10.930 --> 28:13.558
LOOK, CLAIRE, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO KEEP TAKING CARE OF ME.

28:13.560 --> 28:14.652
I'M NOT.

28:14.660 --> 28:17.493
I JUST LIKE
HANGING OUT.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.055
OR WE COULD JUST
GO FOR THE DRIVE

28:21.060 --> 28:23.096
AND THEN YOU GO SEE YOUR DAD
AND I'LL STAY IN SOME LIKE,

28:23.100 --> 28:25.591
CREEPY MOTEL AND READ
A STEPHEN KING BOOK.

28:27.130 --> 28:28.199
OKAY.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.151
MEET ME AFTER FIFTH PERIOD
TOMORROW BY THE GYM.

29:16.060 --> 29:18.255
OH, THIS IS JUST
WHAT I NEED TODAY.

29:18.260 --> 29:21.195
I SEE THIS IS PAYBACK TIME
FOR MY MISSING YOUR OPENING.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.622
JUST SHUT UP !

29:22.630 --> 29:24.894
BOTH OF YOU,
FOR ONCE.

29:24.900 --> 29:26.959
JUST SHUT YOUR
FUCKING MOUTHS.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.622
ALL THAT EVER COMES OUT OF YOU
IS GARBAGE, GARBAGE, GARBAGE !

29:29.630 --> 29:30.790
OKAY...

29:30.800 --> 29:32.392
GOOD,

29:32.400 --> 29:34.652
WE HAVE
A DIALOGUE.

29:38.260 --> 29:39.488
WHERE DID
YOU GET THIS ?

29:39.500 --> 29:40.956
FROM HIS OFFICE.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.655
THEY'RE EVERY PIECE OF DATA
FEINBERG HAS ON BRENDA

29:42.660 --> 29:44.196
AND IT'S ALL DESTROYED.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.828
NOW HE CAN GO BACK TO
WHEREVER HE CAME FROM
BEFORE HE FUCKED HER UP.

29:46.830 --> 29:48.957
YOU'RE OFF
THE HOOK, BERN.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.155
OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS NOTHING TO
DO WITH YOU MISSING HIS SHOW.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.594
DON'T FUCKING TALK ABOUT ME
LIKE I'M NOT HERE !

29:53.600 --> 29:56.990
EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT
AND NEVER HAVE BEEN.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.252
SON, WHAT'S WRONG ?
JUST TELL US.

29:59.260 --> 30:00.625
OH, THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH ME.

30:00.630 --> 30:02.359
I DIDN'T SELL
MY DAUGHTER

30:02.360 --> 30:04.294
TO SOME SMUG,
STAR-FUCKING PSYCHIATRIST

30:04.300 --> 30:06.325
SO, HE COULD PICK HER APART
LIKE A GODDAMN CADAVER

30:06.330 --> 30:08.594
AND TURN HER INTO
SHIT AND GARBAGE

30:08.600 --> 30:10.352
JUST LIKE EVERYTHING
ELSE YOU TOUCH !

30:10.360 --> 30:11.327
BILLY,
SWEETH EART.

30:11.330 --> 30:12.456
YOU BITCH !

30:12.460 --> 30:13.950
YOU'RE THE FUCKING NURSE.

30:13.960 --> 30:16.758
YOU WANNA TIE US UP,
YOU WANNA LOCK US IN A ROOM,
LEAVE US TO DIE.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.990
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT SHOULD DIE, YOU AND HIM !

30:19.000 --> 30:21.457
YOU DON'T GET TO
TOUCH THE CHILDREN.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.899
I REFUSE TO BE
AN AUDIENCE FOR THIS.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.427
OH, BOY, YOU CAN
JUICE HER,

30:36.430 --> 30:38.751
BUT YOU BETTER LET ME
TAKE CARE OF THAT SKIN.

30:38.760 --> 30:42.548
THIS GUY HAS
A REALLY SINEWY NECK.

30:43.260 --> 30:44.522
SINEWY.

30:44.530 --> 30:46.350
I LOVE SAYING THAT WORD,
DON'T YOU ?

30:46.360 --> 30:47.918
I DON'T KNOW.

30:47.930 --> 30:50.228
I WENT OUT WITH THIS GUY ONCE,
HE HAD A REALLY SINEWY NECK.

30:50.230 --> 30:52.323
HE WAS A TOTAL
ANIMAL IN BED.

30:52.330 --> 30:54.298
I MEAN, THE THINGS HE COULD
DO WITH HIS TONGUE.

30:54.300 --> 30:55.790
( slurping )

30:55.800 --> 30:57.449
COURSE, HE THOUGHT HE WAS
GOD'S GIFT TO WOMEN.

30:57.460 --> 30:59.428
I GUESS IN THAT
ONE RESPECT HE WAS.

30:59.430 --> 31:02.126
SO, DO YOU LIKE
SINEWY NECKS, DAVID ?

31:02.130 --> 31:03.688
I NEVER REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

31:03.700 --> 31:05.588
HEY, I'M JUST TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT YOUR TYPE.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.818
BELIEVE ME, I CAN
TELL YOU'RE SINGLE.

31:07.830 --> 31:10.458
AND I KNOW ABOUT A MILLION
PEOPLE I CAN SET YOU UP WITH.

31:10.460 --> 31:13.691
SO, WHAT KIND OF GUYS
DO YOU LIKE ?

31:13.700 --> 31:16.157
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT I LIKE MEN ?

31:16.160 --> 31:18.754
OH, PLEASE, LET'S NOT
PLAY THAT GAME.

31:19.860 --> 31:21.896
I THINK WE SHOULD
FIRE HER.

31:21.900 --> 31:23.197
I'VE BEEN THINKING
THE SAME THING.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.428
HAS SHE MADE A LOT
OF MISTAKES ?

31:24.430 --> 31:25.727
NO.

31:25.730 --> 31:27.891
SHE'S A LITTLE
HARD TO TAKE.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.299
SHE'S A LOT
HARD TO TAKE.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.450
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
ARE HARD TO TAKE,

31:31.460 --> 31:35.419
BUT ONLY BECAUSE THE FIRST SIDE
THEY PRESENT TO YOU IS ANNOYING

31:35.430 --> 31:37.819
OR AGGRESSIVE
BECAUSE THEY'RE NERVOUS.

31:39.260 --> 31:40.955
AND IT'S ONLY AFTER
YOU SPEND SOME TIME WITH THEM

31:40.960 --> 31:42.621
YOU REALIZE MAYBE
THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO THEM

31:42.630 --> 31:44.097
THAT'S WORTH KNOWING.

31:47.430 --> 31:50.149
OR NOT, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.655
( door closing )

31:53.400 --> 31:55.391
SORRY I'M LATE.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.799
BY THE WAY...

31:56.800 --> 31:58.995
I WON'T BE HERE
FOR DINNER TOMORROW.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.228
SO, EVERYONE'S
ON THEIR OWN.

32:00.230 --> 32:01.629
ACTUALLY, I'M GOING
TO BE VOLUNTEERING

32:01.630 --> 32:02.790
WITH THE FOOD
DISTRIBUTION.

32:02.800 --> 32:05.451
WELL, THAT LEAVES
YOU AND ME, CLAIRE.

32:05.460 --> 32:06.654
WANT TO GO TO
THE APPLE PAN ?

32:06.660 --> 32:08.525
UH, CAN'T.

32:08.530 --> 32:10.054
I HAVE TO DO THIS...

32:10.060 --> 32:12.028
ASTRONOMY
OVERNIGHT THING...

32:12.030 --> 32:14.954
AT THE OBSERVATORY
FOR SCHOOL.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.598
I DIDN'T HEAR
ABOUT THIS.

32:16.600 --> 32:17.498
I TOLD YOU.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.149
YOU PROBABLY
WEREN'T LISTENING.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.458
THAT'S THE TYPE OF THING
I WOULD LISTEN TO.

32:22.860 --> 32:26.057
DAVID AND NATE DID IT WHEN
THEY WENT TO BONAVENTURE.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.199
DAVID,
YOU DID THIS ?

32:29.200 --> 32:31.054
UH, YEAH,
I HAD TO.

32:31.060 --> 32:32.698
YOU TOO, NATE ?

32:32.700 --> 32:33.792
YUP.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.529
BACK THEN WE THOUGHT
PLUTO WAS A PLANET.

32:35.530 --> 32:38.249
WHEN DID PLUTO
STOP BEING A PLANET ?

32:38.260 --> 32:39.693
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

32:39.700 --> 32:42.498
WELL, I SUPPOSE IT'S
OKAY FOR YOU TO GO.

32:45.960 --> 32:49.418
( Bernard )
LUCKILY GARETH ISN'T
GOING TO PRESS CHARGES,

32:49.430 --> 32:52.649
BUT I DID PROMISE HIM
THAT STEPS WOULD BE TAKEN

32:52.660 --> 32:54.355
TO REMEDY
THE SITUATION.

32:54.360 --> 32:57.727
I WISH I HAD BEEN THERE TO SEE
THE LOOK ON FEINBERG'S FACE.

32:57.730 --> 32:59.789
I'M SURE HE STARTED WITH
HIS WHOLE BLINKING THING.

32:59.800 --> 33:02.928
BRENDA, WE HAVE
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

33:05.330 --> 33:07.651
OKAY, I'LL TALK
TO BILLY'S DOCTOR,

33:07.660 --> 33:09.992
SEE IF HE NEEDS TO BE
ON DIFFERENT MEDICATION.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.558
ACTUALLY, WE WERE
THINKING OF SOMETHING

33:11.560 --> 33:13.448
A LITTLE
MORE INVOLVED.

33:13.460 --> 33:14.927
YOUR MOTHER AND I FEEL
THAT HE NEEDS TO GO AWAY

33:14.930 --> 33:16.454
FOR INTENSIVE THERAPY.

33:16.460 --> 33:20.123
THERE'S A VERY GOOD
FACILITY IN COLORADO.

33:20.130 --> 33:22.052
YOU WANT TO PUT BILLY
IN AN INSTITUTION ?

33:22.060 --> 33:25.621
OH, PLEASE, LET'S NOT TURN
THIS INTO A 19505 B MOVIE.

33:25.630 --> 33:29.020
THIS PLACE IS RUN BY EXCELLENT
PSYCHIATRIC SPECIALISTS

33:29.030 --> 33:30.292
WHO MAY HAVE SOME...

33:30.300 --> 33:33.952
CREATIVE SOLUTION
TO HELP BILLY.

33:34.600 --> 33:37.125
YOU WANT TO GIVE BILLY
SHOCK TREATMENT.

33:37.130 --> 33:38.427
DARLING, REALLY,

33:38.430 --> 33:40.523
THIS DRAMATIC STREAK, AREN'T
YOU A LITTLE OLD FOR IT ?

33:40.530 --> 33:41.997
AND JUST FOR
THE RECORD,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.298
ELECT ROCONVULSIVE THERAPY
HAS HAD A REAL RESURGENCE

33:44.300 --> 33:47.019
IN THE LAST 10 YEARS,
WITH VERY IMPRESSIVE RESULTS.

33:47.030 --> 33:48.190
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.497
YOUR MOTHER AND I
THINK IT'S BEST.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.388
IT CERTAINLY MAKES
YOUR LIVES EASIER.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.890
GOD FORBID BILLY
SHOULD EMBARRASS YOU

33:52.900 --> 33:55.095
IN FRONT OF YOUR STUPID
FAT CELEBRITY FRIENDS.

33:55.100 --> 33:56.829
UNFORTUNATELY,
HE IS AN ADULT.

33:56.830 --> 33:58.559
WHICH MEANS YOU CAN'T
HAVE HIM COMMITTED

33:58.560 --> 34:00.221
UNLESS HE DOES
SOMETHING DANGEROUS.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.551
DARLING...

34:03.960 --> 34:06.155
WE WERE THINKING THAT
IF YOU TALKED TO HIM,

34:06.160 --> 34:07.991
EXPLAINED HOW IT
WOULD HELP HIM.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.922
FUCK YOU BOTH.

34:09.930 --> 34:11.659
YOU'RE OUT OF
YOUR MINDS.

34:14.700 --> 34:16.918
( door closing )

34:19.130 --> 34:21.553
HI, I'M ANGELA.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.357
YOU MUST BE RUTH.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.850
YES.

34:32.160 --> 34:34.048
I SPILLED SOME BEET SALAD
ON SOMEONE'S WIG,

34:34.060 --> 34:36.449
SO, DAVID SAID
I SHOULD EAT UP HERE.

34:36.460 --> 34:37.825
I GOT THE STAINS OUT.

34:37.830 --> 34:39.991
EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY
GETS CANCER, SO...

34:40.000 --> 34:43.959
I KNOW TONS ABOUT
TAKING CARE OF WIGS.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.750
IS THAT YOURS ?

34:47.760 --> 34:49.557
THE HAIR, I MEAN.

34:49.560 --> 34:52.028
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

34:52.030 --> 34:53.622
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

34:53.630 --> 34:55.825
THANK YOU.

34:56.930 --> 34:58.989
I DON'T WANT TO BE ONE OF
THOSE MENOPAUSAL WOMEN

34:59.000 --> 35:02.492
YOU KNOW, THAT GOES ALL DIKEY
WITH THE BUTCH HAIRCUT.

35:06.830 --> 35:09.594
SO, NATE SAYS THAT
YOU'RE DATING A HAIRDRESSER.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.296
THAT IS SO LUCKY.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.120
IF HE'S ANY GOOD,
I'D LOVE TO KNOW

35:14.130 --> 35:15.927
IF HE CAN DO ANYTHING
WITH THIS MOP.

35:15.930 --> 35:18.023
DOES YOUR BOYFRIEND
COME AROUND ?

35:18.030 --> 35:21.295
HE'S NOT EXACTLY
MY BOYFRIEND.

35:21.300 --> 35:24.895
OH, COME ON,
YOU'RE BLUSHING.

35:24.900 --> 35:28.051
MUST BE PRETTY
SERIOUS, IS IT ?

35:28.060 --> 35:29.652
IS IT SERIOUS ?

35:29.660 --> 35:32.299
OR IS IT
JUST HOT SEX ?

35:34.460 --> 35:37.588
I'M REALLY NOT IN THE MOOD
TO DISCUSS MY PERSONAL LIFE.

35:41.230 --> 35:42.527
OH.

35:52.930 --> 35:55.091
( chattering )

36:00.530 --> 36:03.397
( voicemail )
You have one new message.

36:03.400 --> 36:04.719
( Gabe )
Hey, it's me.

36:04.730 --> 36:08.120
Look, it's better
if I go by myself.

36:08.130 --> 36:10.394
You should probably just
not worry about it, okay ?

36:11.760 --> 36:13.990
Thank you for
trying to...

36:15.700 --> 36:17.349
Look, just...

36:17.360 --> 36:18.998
thank you.

36:19.700 --> 36:21.156
So, that's...

36:21.160 --> 36:23.128
that's it, I guess.

36:24.930 --> 36:26.249
Bye, Claire.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.857
THIS IS DISGUSTING.

36:32.860 --> 36:34.259
YOU HAVE CRAP IN HERE
FROM THE 805.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.796
BILLY, I'LL GET
A PLUMBER.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.449
SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY
KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

36:40.560 --> 36:41.822
WOULD YOU
LOOK AT ME ?

36:41.830 --> 36:43.525
I'D REALLY LIKE TO
TALK TO YOU.

36:45.660 --> 36:48.857
I TAKE IT YOU SPOKE
TO MOM AND DAD.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.496
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED THAT DAY.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.719
YOU KNOW, I WAS ON NEW MEDS,
THEY WEREN'T WORKING.

36:56.730 --> 36:58.220
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

36:59.060 --> 37:00.527
BUT DON'T WORRY.

37:00.530 --> 37:02.452
I'VE ALREADY BEEN
TO MY DOCTOR

37:02.460 --> 37:05.054
AND CHANGED
MY DOSAGE.

37:05.060 --> 37:07.199
AND I ALREADY
FEEL MORE EVEN.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.920
BILLY, I NEED TO KNOW IF
I SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.552
YOU SHOULDN'T.

37:18.130 --> 37:19.722
I SWEAR.

37:20.660 --> 37:22.594
YEAH ?
YEAH.

37:49.530 --> 37:52.454
MY GOD, YOU COULD
EAT OFF THIS SKIN.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.593
ANGELA DOES HER JOB
PERFECTLY.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.818
WHAT ABOUT THOSE HAIRS
IN HER MOLE ?

37:58.830 --> 38:01.025
RICO WOULD NEVER
HAVE LEFT THOSE THERE.

38:01.030 --> 38:03.624
ANGELA HAD A LONG
PHILOSOPHICAL
DEBATE ABOUT IT

38:03.630 --> 38:06.428
AND DECIDED THE NIECES
WOULD WANT TO REMEMBER HER

38:06.430 --> 38:08.159
EXACTLY HOW SHE WAS.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.196
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
THE MEANING OF THIS.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.499
NIKOLAI IS PICKING ME
UP TO GO TO DINNER

38:13.500 --> 38:16.492
AND I WAS PLANNING TO
SERVE HIM SHERRY BEFOREHAND.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.889
I WANTED TO
USE THE GOBLETS

38:18.900 --> 38:20.720
I GOT FROM MY COUSIN HANNAH'S
TRIP TO DRESDEN.

38:20.730 --> 38:22.391
NOW, I CAN'T BECAUSE
SOMEONE BROKE THIS

38:22.400 --> 38:24.322
AND HOPED
I WOULDN'T NOTICE IT.

38:24.330 --> 38:25.752
WHICH ONE OF YOU
DID THIS ?

38:25.760 --> 38:26.920
IT WASN'T ME.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.158
WELL, IT WASN'T ME.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.149
IT WAS ANGELA.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.856
OH, IT WAS
DEFINITELY ANGELA.

38:43.030 --> 38:44.190
HI.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.519
DAVID.

38:45.530 --> 38:46.827
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

38:46.830 --> 38:49.355
I VOLUNTEER WITH THESE GUYS
A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.794
OH, I JUST STARTED.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.097
YOU NEED SOME HELP ?

38:53.100 --> 38:55.318
YEAH, SURE.

39:09.660 --> 39:11.594
DAVID, DAVID--

39:12.530 --> 39:13.895
DAVID !

39:13.900 --> 39:15.197
I'M DYING.

39:15.200 --> 39:16.349
NO, YOU CAN'T.

39:16.360 --> 39:19.488
NOT BEFORE WE MAKE LOVE
ONE LAST TIME...

39:22.160 --> 39:23.821
OKAY.

39:23.830 --> 39:23.898
THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA HELP.

39:29.130 --> 39:30.688
SO, HOW'VE YOU BEEN ?

39:30.700 --> 39:32.053
GOOD, YOU ?

39:32.060 --> 39:33.721
I'M OKAY.

39:35.260 --> 39:37.023
I'VE DRIVEN BY THIS MINI-MALL
HUNDREDS OF TIMES,

39:37.030 --> 39:38.497
BUT I NEVER KNEW
THIS PLACE EXISTED.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.923
IS BEST RESTAURANT
IN ALL OF LOS ANGELES.

39:40.930 --> 39:43.057
AND NOT OUTRAGEOUS
PRICES TOO.

39:43.060 --> 39:45.824
( speaking Russian )

39:47.200 --> 39:48.827
LOTTE, IRINA.

39:48.830 --> 39:50.252
WHAT A SURPRISE
THIS IS.

39:50.260 --> 39:53.650
YOU USUALLY DO NOT COME
IN ON TUESDAY NIGHTS.

39:53.660 --> 39:55.924
CAN WE JOIN YOU ?

39:55.930 --> 39:57.124
PLEASE.

39:57.130 --> 39:59.553
MAYBE ANOTHER TIME.

39:59.560 --> 40:02.393
NO, NO, SHE SAYS
IT'S OKAY.

40:03.700 --> 40:06.453
SO, YOU MUST BE NICKY'S
SPECIAL FRIEND

40:06.460 --> 40:08.724
WE KEEP HEARING
ALL ABOUT.

40:08.730 --> 40:10.618
YOU MUST BE THINKING
OF SOMEONE ELSE.

40:10.630 --> 40:11.597
NO.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.022
YOU LOST
YOUR HUSBAND.

40:13.030 --> 40:14.691
YOU WORK
FOR NICKY.

40:14.700 --> 40:17.260
YOU USED TO
FIX DEAD PEOPLE.

40:17.260 --> 40:19.899
OH, I SUPPOSE
THAT IS ME.

40:19.900 --> 40:22.460
THIS IS RUTH.

40:24.330 --> 40:26.992
SO, THAT GUY I SAW YOU
WITH AT THE CLUB,

40:27.000 --> 40:28.297
IS THAT
A SERIOUS THING ?

40:28.300 --> 40:29.358
EDDIE ?

40:29.360 --> 40:30.725
AH...

40:30.730 --> 40:32.027
NOT REALLY.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.793
NOT YET.

40:34.430 --> 40:36.125
THOSE DRUGS
I SAW YOU TAKING,

40:36.130 --> 40:38.052
IS THAT
A SERIOUS THING ?

40:38.060 --> 40:40.927
NO, NO, I JUST
TRIED THEM ONCE.

40:40.930 --> 40:43.296
I DON'T THINK I'LL BE
TRYING THEM AGAIN.

40:43.300 --> 40:45.256
I'M GLAD TO HEAR
YOU SAY THAT.

40:45.260 --> 40:46.955
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT SHIT
HAS DONE TO MY SISTER.

40:46.960 --> 40:50.123
IT CAN SERIOUSLY
FUCK UP YOUR LIFE, DAVID.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.425
I'D HATE TO
SEE THAT HAPPEN.

40:54.830 --> 40:56.320
IT WAS STUPID,
I KNOW.

40:56.330 --> 40:57.695
I WAS JUST--

40:59.930 --> 41:02.592
YOU KNOW, RICO LEFT,
IT WAS JUST NATE AND ME.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.353
NOT THAT
IT'S AN EXCUSE.

41:07.260 --> 41:09.797
SO, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT KID
I SAW YOU WITH AT THE CLUB ?

41:09.800 --> 41:12.451
LET'S JUST SAY IT WAS
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE.

41:12.460 --> 41:13.859
EVERYONE ELSE
HAS GONE HOME.

41:13.860 --> 41:15.748
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU TWO
ARE WAITING FOR.

41:15.760 --> 41:19.252
DAVID, THIS ISN'T ONE
OF YOUR REGULAR SHIFTS.

41:19.260 --> 41:22.752
IS THERE ANY SPECIAL REASON
YOU SHOWED UP HERE TONIGHT ?

41:23.400 --> 41:25.322
NO.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.553
OH, WELL.

41:31.930 --> 41:33.795
GOODNIGHT,
YOU TWO.

41:33.800 --> 41:35.290
GOODNIGHT.

41:38.130 --> 41:39.688
YOU HUNGRY ?

41:39.700 --> 41:42.453
I'M ALWAYS HUNGRY.

41:43.960 --> 41:46.849
( Russian music)

42:16.630 --> 42:18.359
YOU FUCKING BITCH !

42:18.360 --> 42:21.158
I WOULD LIKE TO
TEAR YOUR HEART OUT

42:21.160 --> 42:23.822
LIKE YOU HAVE
TORN OUT MINE.

42:26.030 --> 42:29.124
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A PICTURE
OF NATE PEEING ON A WALL.

42:29.130 --> 42:30.051
I SEE IT.

42:30.060 --> 42:31.254
I DON'T.

42:31.260 --> 42:33.626
FOUR FROM THE LEFT.

42:33.630 --> 42:36.258
OH, MY GOD.

42:36.260 --> 42:38.421
WHAT'D YOUR MOM SAY
WHEN SHE SAW THAT ?

42:38.430 --> 42:41.820
SHE WAS KIND
OF HORRIFIED, I THINK.

42:42.230 --> 42:44.050
HOW IS YOUR MOM ?

42:44.060 --> 42:45.322
SHE'S...

42:45.330 --> 42:47.195
DATING.

42:47.200 --> 42:48.724
IT'S WEIRD.

42:48.730 --> 42:50.095
WHY ?

42:50.100 --> 42:52.898
BECAUSE SHE'S MY MOTHER,
SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO DATE.

42:55.630 --> 42:58.497
PEOPLE SHOULD
BE WITH PEOPLE.

43:00.930 --> 43:03.728
YEAH, SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE
JUST TOO STUPID TO KNOW IT.

43:10.430 --> 43:12.398
HOW'S YOUR TACO ?

43:14.200 --> 43:15.724
DISGUSTING.

43:20.660 --> 43:23.493
I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT
YOU AND NIKOLAI.

43:23.500 --> 43:25.127
FOR SIX YEARS...

43:25.130 --> 43:28.122
EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT,
I COOK FOR HIM DINNER.

43:28.130 --> 43:32.089
AND THEN HE TAKE ME TO
A $2.50 MOVIE ON FAIRFAX.

43:32.100 --> 43:33.556
THEN YOU COME ALONG...

43:33.560 --> 43:35.152
AND HE STOP CALLING.

43:35.160 --> 43:37.958
I HAVE TO SEE
EVERY GODDAMN FILM

43:37.960 --> 43:40.656
THIS FREDDIE PRINZE JR. DOES,

43:40.660 --> 43:43.788
AND WHAT DO I HAVE
TO SHOW FOR IT ?

43:43.800 --> 43:45.893
I'M SORRY.

43:47.960 --> 43:50.292
DO YOU WANT TO
MARRY NICKY OR NOT ?

43:50.300 --> 43:54.418
MARRIAGE IS THE LAST THING
I WOULD EVER WANT AGAIN.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.255
MAYBE I HAVE AN AMUSING
FLIRTATION WITH NIKOLAI,

43:58.260 --> 44:00.956
BUT HE SCARES ME.

44:02.530 --> 44:03.758
BEST OF ALL,
I HAVE THIS JOB,

44:03.760 --> 44:07.025
SOMETHING I NEVER WOULD
HAVE PREDICT ED FOR MYSELF.

44:07.030 --> 44:10.022
AND I LO IT

44:10.030 --> 44:12.123
BECAUSE IT'S MINE.

44:17.460 --> 44:18.927
AND I WOULD...

44:18.930 --> 44:22.525
NEVER DO ANYTHING
TO JEOPARDIZE THAT.

44:24.330 --> 44:26.355
WHICH MEANS I SHOULD
PROBABLY JUST FINISH DINNER

44:26.360 --> 44:29.124
WITH NIKOLAI
AND GO HOME.

44:36.030 --> 44:37.327
THANK YOU.

44:37.330 --> 44:39.252
I'VE HAD THE BEST TIME
COMING TO THIS FUNNY RESTAURANT

44:39.260 --> 44:41.421
AND HAVING YOU YELL AT ME
IN THE BATHROOM.

44:47.500 --> 44:50.594
DO YOU REALIZE THE WHOLE TIME
WE WERE GOING OUT,

44:50.600 --> 44:52.625
I WAS NEVER IN
YOUR BEDROOM AT NIGHT ?

44:52.630 --> 44:53.722
WELL...

44:55.630 --> 44:57.791
YOU'RE HERE NOW,
AREN'T YOU ?

45:10.600 --> 45:13.194
WHOA, THIS IS NOT
THE DAVID I KNOW.

45:13.200 --> 45:14.929
MAYBE THIS IS
THE REAL ME.

45:14.930 --> 45:16.921
I'M NOT SURE
WE SHOULD.

45:16.930 --> 45:17.999
WHY NOT ?

45:18.000 --> 45:19.991
WELL, I'M KIND OF SEEING
SOMEBODY RIGHT NOW.

45:20.000 --> 45:20.989
I DON'T CARE.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.399
I DO.

45:23.760 --> 45:25.557
COME ON, DAVID !

45:27.030 --> 45:28.520
PLEASE, WHY'D YOU
EVEN COME UP HERE,

45:28.530 --> 45:30.418
IF YOU WEREN'T INTO
SOMETHING HAPPENING ?

45:30.430 --> 45:31.397
TO TALK TO YOU.

45:31.400 --> 45:32.856
TO SEE HOW
YOU WERE DOING.

45:32.860 --> 45:34.748
TO BE FRIENDS.

45:34.760 --> 45:36.751
I DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS,
I WANT TO FUCK !

45:36.760 --> 45:39.194
WELL, I'M NOT
INTO THAT.

45:39.200 --> 45:40.997
CAN'T WE
JUST HAVE SEX ?

45:41.000 --> 45:43.127
IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO MEAN ANYTHING.

45:44.600 --> 45:47.728
IT'S GETTING LATE,
I SHOULD JUST GO.

45:50.600 --> 45:53.194
YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

45:56.830 --> 45:58.855
( door slamming )

46:09.200 --> 46:10.997
CLAIRE, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE ?

46:11.000 --> 46:13.457
I THOUGHT DAVID AND I
COVERED FOR YOU

46:13.460 --> 46:15.257
SO, YOU COULD
BE OUT HAVING FUN.

46:16.360 --> 46:17.622
WHAT'S WRONG ?

46:17.630 --> 46:21.350
THERE'S THIS REALLY
BIG HOLE IN MY SOCK.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.390
MAYBE GABE JUST
WANTED TO BE ALONE.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.697
I KNOW.

46:31.860 --> 46:33.293
IS HE YOUR BOYFRIEND ?

46:33.300 --> 46:34.927
NO.

46:36.760 --> 46:37.988
IT'S JUST...

46:38.000 --> 46:40.855
HE NEEDS ME.

46:41.930 --> 46:44.353
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE, I FELT...

46:44.360 --> 46:45.725
IMPORTANT.

46:45.730 --> 46:47.823
LIKE SOMEONE
NEEDED ME.

46:47.830 --> 46:49.855
NOT LIKE SOME
ANNOYING EXTRA PERSON

46:49.860 --> 46:52.590
JUST LUMPED IN
WITH EVERYONE ELSE.

46:53.960 --> 46:55.951
NO ONE'S
EVER NEEDED ME.

46:55.960 --> 46:58.155
I NEED YOU.

46:58.160 --> 46:59.889
RIGHT.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.491
I FELT THIS REALLY
INTENSE CONNECTION

47:08.500 --> 47:11.719
AND NOW
IT'S JUST GONE.

47:13.700 --> 47:15.952
AND I WANT IT BACK.

47:17.700 --> 47:20.658
I WANT HIM BACK.

47:20.660 --> 47:24.118
IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ME ?

47:24.130 --> 47:26.291
IS THERE SOMETHING
ABOUT ME THAT MAKES ME

47:26.300 --> 47:27.824
DESERVE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS ?

47:27.830 --> 47:29.252
DESERVE WHAT ?

47:29.260 --> 47:31.421
JUST FEELING REALLY
CLOSE TO SOMEONE

47:31.430 --> 47:33.318
THEN HAVING THEM
JUST DISAPPEAR...

47:33.330 --> 47:36.356
LIKE I MEAN NOTHING.

47:37.630 --> 47:39.097
CLAIRE...

47:39.300 --> 47:42.349
GABE JUST WENT TO VISIT
HIS FATHER FOR A DAY.

47:44.560 --> 47:47.393
I THINK YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT DAD.

47:49.430 --> 47:51.318
LOOK, WE NEVER
TALK ABOUT HIM

47:51.330 --> 47:53.252
AND THAT'S OKAY,

47:53.260 --> 47:55.455
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT.

47:55.460 --> 47:58.429
BUT AT SOME POINT YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DEAL WITH HOW YOU FEEL.

48:00.260 --> 48:01.898
OH, GOD, CAN'T I
JUST GET UPSET

48:01.900 --> 48:05.290
WITHOUT HAVING TO FOCUS ON
WHAT'S REALLY MAKING ME UPSET ?

48:07.230 --> 48:09.619
IT WORKED FOR ME
FOR 34 YEARS.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.518
HEY.

48:17.930 --> 48:19.989
( male )
Hey, who's this ?

48:20.000 --> 48:22.457
JIM, WHO'S THIS ?

48:22.460 --> 48:24.223
Steve.

48:24.230 --> 48:25.822
So, what do
you look like ?

48:25.830 --> 48:29.948
I'M 6'2", 190 POUNDS,
AND I'M A PROFESSIONAL BOXER.

48:29.960 --> 48:32.394
Yeah, what's
your dick like ?

48:32.400 --> 48:34.391
NINE AND A HALF INCHES,
UNCUT.

48:34.400 --> 48:36.288
SO, WHAT ARE
YOU LOOKING FOR ?

48:36.300 --> 48:38.655
A nasty top to
fuck my brains out.

48:38.660 --> 48:40.298
FOUND HIM.

48:40.300 --> 48:42.450
NOW, GET ON YOUR KNEES
AND SUCK MY COCK, BOY.

48:42.460 --> 48:43.825
Oh, fuck,
yes, sir.

48:43.830 --> 48:45.889
Oh, yes.

48:45.900 --> 48:47.788
I DON'T CARE
WHAT TIME IT IS.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.427
I NEED TO
BE WITH SOMEONE.

48:49.430 --> 48:51.227
SOMEONE,
THAT'S COMFORTING.

48:51.230 --> 48:53.619
OKAY, I WANT TO
TALK TO YOU.

48:55.400 --> 48:58.096
IF THIS IS ABOUT BILLY,
I CAN'T.

48:58.100 --> 49:01.957
I'VE DONE NOTHING BUT TALK
ABOUT BILLY FOR TWO DAYS.

49:07.660 --> 49:09.628
WELL, WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH HIM ?

49:09.630 --> 49:11.029
MMM.

49:14.060 --> 49:15.527
LOOK...

49:18.900 --> 49:21.494
I KNOW THIS IS
REALLY HARD FOR YOU.

49:22.200 --> 49:25.397
I'VE HAD SOME TIME TO CALM DOWN
ABOUT THE PICTURE,

49:25.400 --> 49:27.129
SO, YOU CAN JUST...

49:27.130 --> 49:30.258
SPILL YOUR GUTS
TO ME, OKAY ?

49:32.360 --> 49:35.193
I PROMISE NOT TO
MAKE IT ABOUT ME.

49:36.930 --> 49:39.990
I'M TOO TIRED.

49:41.330 --> 49:43.594
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

49:46.530 --> 49:48.828
I LOVE YOU
AND I NEED YOU.

49:48.830 --> 49:51.697
IT'S OKAY FOR YOU
TO NEED ME TOO.

49:51.700 --> 49:53.395
I WANT YOU
TO NEED ME.

50:00.960 --> 50:02.825
I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN.

50:25.730 --> 50:27.948
ROUGH NIGHT, STUD ?

50:29.500 --> 50:31.695
YOU'RE FIRED.

50:36.360 --> 50:38.419
FUCK !

50:41.800 --> 50:44.257
( female )
YOO-HOO, BRENDA !

50:44.260 --> 50:46.694
BRENDA, I KNOW YOU'RE HOME,
YOUR CAR'S OUT FRONT.

50:46.700 --> 50:49.692
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S SO STRANGE
ABOUT A SPONTANEOUS BRUNCH.

50:49.700 --> 50:50.849
I THINK IT'S FUN.

50:50.860 --> 50:53.420
IT'S WEIRD.

50:54.900 --> 50:56.788
YOU DON'T DO
THINGS LIKE THIS.

50:56.800 --> 50:59.394
YOU PAY PEOPLE TO
DO THINGS LIKE THIS.

50:59.400 --> 51:01.994
OH, HELLO, NATE.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.194
HEY.

51:03.200 --> 51:05.122
NOW I SEE WHY YOU'RE
SO UPSET THAT I'M HERE.

51:05.130 --> 51:08.327
MY MOTHER'S COME OVER
TO SEE IF I TALKED BILLY

51:08.330 --> 51:10.218
INTO COMMITTING HIMSELF.

51:10.230 --> 51:12.528
SHE JUST LOVES
SAYING THAT.

51:12.530 --> 51:15.158
IT MAKES HER FATHER AND I
SOUND MORE LIKE MONSTERS.

51:15.160 --> 51:17.720
WELL, I DIDN'T DO IT
AND I'M NOT GOING TO.

51:17.730 --> 51:19.152
GODDAMNIT !

51:21.500 --> 51:24.219
I ASKED FOR CHIVES AND THEY
GIVE ME THIS VEGGIE CRAP.

51:31.360 --> 51:32.998
BRENDA...

51:35.660 --> 51:38.049
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU
DON'T KNOW ABOUT BILLY.

51:38.060 --> 51:40.392
OH, HERE WE GO.

51:41.860 --> 51:46.229
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WERE
IN EUROPE THAT SUMMER ?

51:48.260 --> 51:50.592
BILLY DIDN'T TRY
TO KILL HIMSELF.

51:51.960 --> 51:53.552
WHAT ?

51:53.560 --> 51:55.994
YOUR FATHER AND I HAD
GOTTEN BACK FROM A CONFERENCE

51:56.000 --> 51:57.729
TO FIND OUR
HOUSE ON FIRE.

51:57.730 --> 52:00.119
IT STARTED RIGHT BELOW
THE FAMILY ROOM.

52:00.130 --> 52:02.451
REMEMBER, WE HAD IT REDONE
WHEN YOU WERE AWAY ?

52:02.460 --> 52:04.758
YEAH, BUT BILLY WAS--

52:04.760 --> 52:07.297
I WENT TO VISIT HIM
IN THE HOSPITAL.

52:07.300 --> 52:08.790
HE WAS THERE
ALL SUMMER.

52:08.800 --> 52:10.597
YOUR FATHER AND I
PUT HIM THERE.

52:10.600 --> 52:12.056
WE HAD NO CHOICE.

52:12.060 --> 52:14.096
THAT FIRE WASN'T
ACCIDENTAL, BRENDA.

52:14.100 --> 52:15.920
HE WAS MAKING
A BOMB.

52:15.930 --> 52:17.921
THIS IS GETTING REALLY
FUCKING DESPERATE, MOTHER.

52:17.930 --> 52:19.557
WHAT, NOW,
BILLY'S THE UNABOMBER ?

52:19.560 --> 52:21.221
HE HAD
WRITTEN THINGS.

52:21.230 --> 52:24.495
UGLY, VIOLENT THINGS
ABOUT YOUR FATHER AND ME.

52:24.500 --> 52:25.990
ABOUT YOU.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.150
HE WAS DANGEROUS.

52:29.860 --> 52:31.691
YOU LET ME BELIEVE
FOR ALL THESE YEARS

52:31.700 --> 52:34.351
THAT BILLY TRIED
TO KILL HIMSELF.

52:35.860 --> 52:37.896
WE WERE ONLY TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU, HONEY.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.895
GET OUT OF
MY HOUSE.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.696
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE,
YOU FUCKING LUNATIC !

52:47.960 --> 52:49.894
( phone )

52:50.600 --> 52:52.852
UH, HELLO ?

52:54.300 --> 52:57.952
DAVE, THIS IS
A REALLY BAD TIME.

52:58.930 --> 53:00.795
YOU KNOW WHAT THE REALLY
SICK THING IS, MOTHER ?

53:02.730 --> 53:05.893
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME.

53:05.900 --> 53:07.390
BRENDA--

53:07.400 --> 53:08.890
BRENDA, HANG ON.

53:08.900 --> 53:10.253
I'LL CALL
YOU LATER, NATE.

53:10.260 --> 53:12.353
WHEN THAT FUCKING ASSHOLE'S
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

53:12.360 --> 53:13.998
DAVE, I GOTTA GO.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.298
WHAT, YOU FIRED
HER ALREADY ?

53:17.300 --> 53:20.155
OH, FOR CHRISSAKE.

53:20.160 --> 53:23.254
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
LINED UP SOMEBODY ELSE FIRST.

53:23.260 --> 53:24.727
AND WHY ARE
YOU WHISPERING ?

53:24.730 --> 53:27.119
I'M HIDING UP HERE UNTIL
SHE FINISHES MRS. SARNO.

53:27.130 --> 53:29.325
So, which of those other
people did you like best ?

53:29.330 --> 53:32.299
LOOK, LET'S NOT MAKE
ANY QUICK DECISIONS.

53:32.300 --> 53:35.451
I GUESS I COULD PROBABLY LIVE
WITH THE PANIC ATTACK GUY.

53:35.460 --> 53:37.792
Uh, I've got
a better idea.

53:41.430 --> 53:42.727
HEY, RICO.

53:43.900 --> 53:45.322
BAD TIME ?

53:45.330 --> 53:47.548
NO, NO, EVERYONE'S AT LUNCH
EXCEPT FOR ME AND PAM.

53:47.560 --> 53:49.494
YOU'RE ONE OF THE FISHERS,
AREN'T YOU ?

53:49.500 --> 53:51.525
( laughing )

53:56.430 --> 53:59.251
CIGARETTE BREAK,
BUT I GOTTA BE BACK IN 10

53:59.260 --> 54:01.353
'CAUSE I TOLD GILARDI
I'D HAVE THIS ONE DONE
WHEN HE GOT BACK.

54:03.330 --> 54:05.992
( male recording )
The subscriber you've
called is outside the--

54:45.760 --> 54:47.796
OH, GREAT,
FUCKING HELL.

54:50.900 --> 54:52.219
HERE, LET ME
HELP YOU.

54:57.330 --> 54:58.399
SHIT.

55:01.230 --> 55:03.027
I DON'T KNOW WHY I BROUGHT
SO MUCH STUFF HERE.

55:03.030 --> 55:06.158
I GUESS I'M JUST
A NESTER.

55:10.130 --> 55:13.122
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
THAT I BROKE THE GOBLET.

55:14.460 --> 55:15.791
IT WAS A GIFT
FROM MY COUSIN.

55:15.800 --> 55:18.360
YEAH, TRIP TO DRESDEN,
I HEARD.

55:20.200 --> 55:21.792
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I DIDN'T...

55:21.800 --> 55:23.199
JUST TELL YOU.

55:23.200 --> 55:25.088
IT'S TOTALLY
UNLIKE ME.

55:25.100 --> 55:27.193
I USUALLY JUST SAY
WHATEVER I'M THINKING.

55:27.200 --> 55:28.792
I NOTICED.

55:30.230 --> 55:32.698
BUT I SAW THAT
BROKEN GLASS

55:32.700 --> 55:36.921
AND I JUST WAS OVERCOME
WITH THIS FEELING

55:36.930 --> 55:39.797
THAT IT WAS BETTER
TO JUST...

55:39.800 --> 55:41.825
IGNORE IT.

55:41.830 --> 55:44.890
JUST PRETEND THAT
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

55:44.900 --> 55:46.492
I GET THAT FEELING

55:46.500 --> 55:49.799
FROM ALL
OF YOU HERE.

55:49.800 --> 55:52.223
EVERYONE IS
SO FRAGILE

55:52.230 --> 55:55.825
AND CAN'T BEAR
TO HEAR ANYTHING.

55:57.060 --> 55:58.459
IS THAT EVERYTHING ?

55:58.460 --> 56:02.055
I MEAN, ALL I DID WAS TRY TO
FIX DAVID UP WITH THIS GUY

56:02.060 --> 56:04.597
AND I THOUGHT HE WAS
GONNA KILL ME.

56:04.600 --> 56:08.457
I MEAN, I NEVER MET ANYONE WHO
WAS SO UPTIGHT ABOUT BEING GAY.

56:12.930 --> 56:14.397
THAN KS.

56:18.030 --> 56:20.658
YOU KNOW SOMETHING ?

56:20.660 --> 56:23.356
I NEVER WORKED
IN A FUNERAL HOME

56:23.360 --> 56:26.056
THAT WAS
THIS DEPRESSING.

56:30.360 --> 56:32.590
( door closing )

56:34.060 --> 56:37.052
TELL ME YOU'RE HAPPIER HERE,
AND I'LL GO.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.891
IT'S NOT PERFECT.

56:38.900 --> 56:41.221
THESE BODY FARMS ARE
A FUCKING ASSEMBLY LINE.

56:41.230 --> 56:44.449
AND I'VE GOT LIKE 12 IDIOTS
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.

56:44.460 --> 56:45.825
WELL, AT
FISHER & SONS

56:45.830 --> 56:47.195
YOU ONLY GET TWO OF THOSE
AT THE MOST.

56:47.200 --> 56:48.690
AND GILARDI
LIED TO ME.

56:48.700 --> 56:51.498
MY HOURS ARE NOTHING LIKE
HE SAID THEY'D BE.

56:51.500 --> 56:53.821
AND THE WORK HERE IS...

56:53.830 --> 56:57.152
NOT EVEN AS CHALLENGING,
YOU KNOW ?

56:58.730 --> 56:59.992
NATE...

57:01.500 --> 57:04.799
IT WAS KROEHNER WHO BURNED DOWN
THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET.

57:05.800 --> 57:08.826
AND GILARDI'S TOLD PEOPLE
THAT HE'S NOT DONE TRYING

57:08.830 --> 57:10.593
TO DRIVE YOU GUYS
OUT OF BUSINESS.

57:10.600 --> 57:13.421
DOES THAT MEAN
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
FOR YOU TO COME BACK ?

57:13.430 --> 57:16.422
NO, BUT IF I DO, YOU HAVE
TO MATCH WHAT I'M MAKING HERE.

57:16.430 --> 57:19.092
PLUS GUARANTEE ME FLEXIBLE
HOURS FOR PICKING UP JULIO,

57:19.100 --> 57:20.988
AND HELPING OUT
WHEN THE BABY COMES.

57:21.000 --> 57:21.921
DONE.

57:21.930 --> 57:23.852
AND IF I DO DECIDE
TO COME BACK...

57:25.430 --> 57:27.193
IT'S NOT FOR GOOD.

57:29.960 --> 57:32.258
I'M NEVER GONNA
BECOME A PARTNER, AM I ?

57:32.260 --> 57:35.320
I CAN'T OFFER
YOU THAT.

57:37.930 --> 57:39.898
UNLESS YOU WANT
TO MARRY CLAIRE.

57:41.800 --> 57:43.722
UH, NO, THANK YOU.

57:45.730 --> 57:47.493
OKAY, I CAN START
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

57:47.500 --> 57:49.058
THANK YOU.

57:49.060 --> 57:50.755
THAT MAKES ME
VERY HAPPY

57:50.760 --> 57:52.853
AND IT WILL MAKE
DAVID VERY HAPPY.

57:53.600 --> 57:54.919
HEY.

57:54.930 --> 57:57.455
I HEARD THERE'S SOME PICTURE
OF YOU IN A GALLERY PEEING.

57:57.460 --> 57:59.291
IS THAT TRUE ?

58:00.830 --> 58:03.151
I JUST WANTED TO GET
GABE'S FATHER'S NUMBER

58:03.160 --> 58:04.650
SO, I COULD
TALK TO HIM.

58:04.660 --> 58:06.992
WELL, WHY WOULD
GABE'S STEP-FATHER

58:07.000 --> 58:08.797
KNOW WHERE
GABE WAS ?

58:08.800 --> 58:11.849
NO, HIS FATHER, THE ONE
WHO LIVES IN BARSTOW.

58:13.700 --> 58:16.589
YEAH, GABE'S FATHER
DIED WHEN HE WAS FOUR.

58:17.700 --> 58:19.019
OH.

58:22.400 --> 58:24.459
OH, IF YOU SHOULD
RUN INTO GABE,

58:24.460 --> 58:26.121
WOULD YOU TELL HIM
I REALLY DON'T APPRECIATE

58:26.130 --> 58:27.995
HIS STAYING OUT
ALL NIGHT ?

58:32.800 --> 58:35.098
( Gabe )
So, that's...

58:35.100 --> 58:37.352
That's it,
I guess.

58:39.030 --> 58:41.157
Bye, Claire.

58:41.160 --> 58:42.559
MRS. DIMAS !

58:42.560 --> 58:44.858
MRS. DIMAS !

58:44.860 --> 58:47.351
MRS. DIMAS !
