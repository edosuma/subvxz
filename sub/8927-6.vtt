WEBVTT

00:11.167 --> 00:12.927
I have committed men and resources

00:12.951 --> 00:15.418
to aid you in retrieving the Urca gold

00:15.453 --> 00:17.003
in exchange for which you assured me

00:17.038 --> 00:19.839
expelling Captain Vane from that fort.

00:19.874 --> 00:21.341
Back from a lengthy journey,

00:21.376 --> 00:23.626
and not one of them has
felt the need to have a go.

00:23.678 --> 00:25.962
Maybe they was told
to stay away from it.

00:26.014 --> 00:28.381
To prevent them from divulging a secret.

00:28.433 --> 00:31.384
Max's share ain't the only
item the men took issue with.

00:31.436 --> 00:32.852
You chose her.

00:32.887 --> 00:34.470
They gave me a choice,
but it was no choice.

00:34.522 --> 00:36.889
Anne? Anne!

00:36.901 --> 00:39.142
Until I know what
you're going to say to the men,

00:39.144 --> 00:41.194
I can't let you say anything to the men.

00:41.229 --> 00:43.196
The girl's name is Abigail Ashe.

00:43.231 --> 00:44.897
You need to obtain
her from Captain Vane.

00:44.949 --> 00:46.783
And when you return her to her father,

00:46.804 --> 00:49.485
you're going to explain what it is
you're trying to accomplish here...

00:49.487 --> 00:51.704
a Nassau that can self-govern.

00:51.740 --> 00:53.140
It's too great of a force to defeat.

00:53.158 --> 00:54.824
We attempt to fight the body of it.

00:54.826 --> 00:57.388
The only way to beat it
is to cut off its head.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

03:29.364 --> 03:30.813
Had I two rounds left,

03:30.865 --> 03:33.316
I would shoot both of you
and be done with all of this.

03:33.318 --> 03:35.701
Can't avoid it any longer.
It's time you made a choice.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.320
Enough.

03:37.372 --> 03:38.988
You two will resolve this.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.490
This isn't going to end
the way you want it to.

03:40.542 --> 03:43.159
This ends in this room right now.

03:43.211 --> 03:45.995
He can't let it, and neither can I.

03:49.384 --> 03:50.500
Sit down.

03:50.502 --> 03:53.252
Why the fuck should I sit?

03:55.006 --> 03:58.341
There is a girl in your possession.

03:58.343 --> 04:01.561
Her name is Abigail.

04:01.596 --> 04:03.563
Give her to me and I
will stand down my men.

04:03.598 --> 04:04.981
You can have the fort.

04:08.853 --> 04:10.937
You'd give all this up
for a little money?

04:13.358 --> 04:15.074
She's worth more to me than money.

04:18.196 --> 04:20.446
She's the future of this place.

04:26.871 --> 04:29.705
Send word for your father.

04:29.757 --> 04:31.791
He should hear this as well.

04:53.565 --> 04:56.782
We're through the Twin Pass and
well into the zone on schedule.

05:00.788 --> 05:02.371
- Captain?
- Listen.

05:04.709 --> 05:06.242
Do you hear it?

05:09.047 --> 05:10.546
No women.

05:12.383 --> 05:15.001
Yes, well...

05:15.053 --> 05:16.919
in any event, according to the whore,

05:16.921 --> 05:18.671
the True North should be here.

05:18.723 --> 05:20.673
According to the whore,
the ship is insured

05:20.725 --> 05:22.341
up, down, and sideways,

05:22.393 --> 05:24.927
so they should surrender the
moment they see the black,

05:24.979 --> 05:27.229
netting the men a quick
and painless score,

05:27.265 --> 05:29.682
and you an auspicious debut.

05:29.734 --> 05:31.350
Now it's just a matter of whether or not

05:31.402 --> 05:33.486
the whore's information proves accurate.

05:36.024 --> 05:40.743
And if there's anything you
need assistance with today,

05:40.778 --> 05:43.496
please don't hesitate to ask me.

05:43.531 --> 05:46.666
- Such as?
- Well, I've heard things.

05:46.701 --> 05:48.451
Heard the role you played on the Ranger

05:48.453 --> 05:50.620
was almost entirely a political one.

05:50.672 --> 05:55.174
Heard Captain Vane was
the sailor among you.

05:55.209 --> 05:57.677
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

05:57.712 --> 05:59.512
You certainly would not be the first man

05:59.547 --> 06:01.097
to learn how to captain a ship

06:01.132 --> 06:02.932
after being named captain of a ship.

06:02.967 --> 06:06.018
- I see.
- Look, Jack.

06:06.054 --> 06:08.220
I vouched for you.

06:08.272 --> 06:11.774
We are both invested in this...

06:11.809 --> 06:14.644
experiment working out.

06:16.064 --> 06:17.530
Sails!

06:18.733 --> 06:20.199
Sails!

06:20.234 --> 06:22.284
West, northwest!

06:22.320 --> 06:24.288
It's the True North!

06:25.572 --> 06:26.956
Right where she's supposed to be.

06:26.991 --> 06:29.825
- All right, gents! Let's go get her!
- Come to starboard.

06:29.827 --> 06:32.995
Make a heading west,
nor-west to intercept her.

06:33.047 --> 06:36.499
Chop it off on the braces and
strike the mainsail and foresail.

06:41.506 --> 06:43.055
Today!

06:54.647 --> 06:57.047
Bit of a surprise to them,
that one, wasn't it?

06:57.071 --> 06:59.355
Not to blame them,

06:59.357 --> 07:01.490
seeing as that you just opened a pursuit

07:01.526 --> 07:03.743
where speed will be of the essence

07:03.778 --> 07:08.864
by releasing the sails and
steering us in the wrong direction.

07:08.916 --> 07:11.701
Though I suppose there's a chance

07:11.703 --> 07:14.370
you struck the sails to make us nimbler.

07:14.422 --> 07:18.591
Tack hard to starboard to
alter our angle of approach.

07:18.626 --> 07:21.711
Come up right behind
her and steal her wind.

07:27.385 --> 07:28.851
Sails!

07:28.886 --> 07:30.269
Heard you the first time!

07:30.304 --> 07:32.521
Second set!

07:32.557 --> 07:34.523
West, south-west!

07:37.395 --> 07:39.895
Two prizes.

07:39.947 --> 07:41.897
Not likely.

07:48.873 --> 07:50.990
It's pursuing ours.

07:51.042 --> 07:53.159
Another hunter.

07:53.211 --> 07:55.628
We have competition it would seem.

08:22.106 --> 08:23.272
Fuck this.

08:23.274 --> 08:25.858
Where are you going?

08:25.910 --> 08:28.194
I'll be back in an hour.

08:28.246 --> 08:29.495
Anyone asks, I'm taking a shit.

08:29.530 --> 08:30.663
Who shits for an hour?

08:30.698 --> 08:32.664
I do.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.667
Captain says anyone walks
away from this beach

08:34.702 --> 08:37.336
with this fight looming
don't need to ever come back.

08:37.371 --> 08:38.621
Shut the fuck up.

08:38.673 --> 08:40.121
And what's worse, you're going to go

08:40.124 --> 08:42.842
to the one place on the island
he said we're not allowed to go.

08:42.876 --> 08:44.426
He said the whores there work too hard

08:44.462 --> 08:46.178
taking secrets from men's heads.

08:46.214 --> 08:48.848
Mate, I'm so close, I can smell her.

08:48.883 --> 08:51.851
So either I'm going up
there and fucking Charlotte,

08:51.886 --> 08:53.686
or I'm fucking you down here

08:53.721 --> 08:55.471
imagining I'm fucking
Charlotte up there.

08:57.108 --> 08:58.557
Tell her I said hello.

08:58.609 --> 09:00.476
Right.

09:00.478 --> 09:02.561
Fuck.

09:02.613 --> 09:04.563
Men cannot be kept in this state.

09:04.615 --> 09:06.115
Sooner or later, they must fight

09:06.150 --> 09:07.817
or they must know
there will be no fight.

09:07.819 --> 09:10.653
And now he's nowhere to be found.

09:10.705 --> 09:12.321
Much can be said about Captain,

09:12.373 --> 09:14.824
but shying away from a fight
isn't one of them.

09:14.876 --> 09:17.409
Whatever he's doing up
there in that tavern,

09:17.461 --> 09:20.996
I'm certain it's towards the
end of prevailing in this fight.

09:21.048 --> 09:23.415
At a certain point I'll cease
to care what his ends are

09:23.467 --> 09:26.001
and lead these men up that hill myself.

09:29.173 --> 09:32.174
I don't think that's going
to be an option anytime soon.

09:32.176 --> 09:33.976
What are you talking about?

10:56.227 --> 10:58.510
It will likely start with three ships,

10:58.562 --> 11:01.263
maybe four.

11:01.265 --> 11:04.233
A tactical assault to retake the bay.

11:04.268 --> 11:07.770
Once England decides she
wants this place back,

11:07.822 --> 11:12.825
the resources that she will
commit towards that end

11:12.860 --> 11:14.994
are inexhaustible.

11:15.029 --> 11:17.997
Sooner or later, we'll be driven inland,

11:18.032 --> 11:20.833
forced to fight as
rebels from the interior

11:20.868 --> 11:23.836
hoping to inflict enough damage

11:23.871 --> 11:26.171
and expense to compel the new governor

11:26.207 --> 11:29.208
to negotiate with what's left of us.

11:29.260 --> 11:32.795
For years I prepared for that fight.

11:32.797 --> 11:36.598
Now it would appear that
there is another way,

11:36.634 --> 11:41.220
a way in which we can control
our futures without that fight.

11:43.190 --> 11:44.773
And as fate would have it,

11:44.809 --> 11:48.978
you are holding the key
to make that possible.

11:50.481 --> 11:52.698
The girl.

11:52.733 --> 11:55.317
Her father is a very powerful,

11:55.369 --> 11:57.486
very influential man.

11:57.538 --> 12:00.289
If I return her to him unharmed,

12:00.324 --> 12:03.575
I believe that I can win him as an ally,

12:03.627 --> 12:05.160
an advocate in London

12:05.162 --> 12:09.298
to argue for a
reconciliation with England

12:09.333 --> 12:13.669
where we keep our assets,
maintain control,

12:13.671 --> 12:16.338
and name a governor of our own choosing.

12:16.340 --> 12:19.675
I believe that there is
an opportunity at hand,

12:19.677 --> 12:24.313
an opportunity where we
control our own futures.

12:26.684 --> 12:29.852
We just all need to agree to take it.

12:29.854 --> 12:31.770
Peter Ashe.

12:31.822 --> 12:35.190
Returning his daughter
might gain his ear,

12:35.192 --> 12:37.026
but there is no man in the Americas

12:37.028 --> 12:39.995
with a more strident
contempt for piracy than he.

12:40.031 --> 12:44.033
No amount of appreciation is
going to make him forget that.

12:44.085 --> 12:47.453
A long time ago, he and I were friends.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.505
Good friends.

12:49.540 --> 12:53.208
We fought alongside each
other towards this very end...

12:55.546 --> 12:58.263
a stable and prosperous Nassau.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.549
We're talking about a man

13:00.601 --> 13:03.218
who took a struggling Carolina colony

13:03.270 --> 13:05.721
and turned it into a commercial success.

13:05.723 --> 13:09.191
And from what I'm told
by friends in London,

13:09.226 --> 13:11.193
is unparalleled in his ability

13:11.228 --> 13:14.480
to maneuver the avenues
of power in Parliament.

13:14.532 --> 13:18.567
If that man could be persuaded,
as you say,

13:18.619 --> 13:22.654
if that man chose to be our advocate,

13:22.706 --> 13:24.990
that would certainly argue
well for our prospects.

13:25.042 --> 13:27.910
What do I get?

13:27.912 --> 13:30.913
If this, if that.

13:30.915 --> 13:33.582
Yet it all relies on an
asset you do not possess.

13:33.584 --> 13:36.385
What do you get?
You get what we all get... a future.

13:36.420 --> 13:37.920
Show it to me.

13:37.972 --> 13:39.755
Hand me my future here in this room.

13:41.559 --> 13:45.260
What? It isn't just your words, is it?

13:45.262 --> 13:48.397
The promise of a thing hard to
define and impossible to deliver...

13:48.432 --> 13:51.266
that is what you're suggesting I get

13:51.268 --> 13:52.768
in exchange for surrendering an asset

13:52.770 --> 13:54.236
worth what that girl is worth?

13:54.271 --> 13:55.854
If you're looking for
something more immediate,

13:55.906 --> 13:58.323
then how about your own survival?

13:58.359 --> 14:01.076
If we cannot agree to do this together,
then I walk out of here

14:01.112 --> 14:03.495
and I lead my men in cutting down

14:03.531 --> 14:04.997
what remains of yours.

14:05.032 --> 14:07.666
This girl is so valuable to you,

14:07.701 --> 14:10.419
and you would risk her death
just to punish me?

14:10.454 --> 14:12.871
You want her? You have two choices.

14:12.923 --> 14:15.624
Try and take her and hope
she survives the fight

14:15.626 --> 14:19.461
or pay me what she's worth.

14:19.463 --> 14:22.097
And what exactly do you
estimate that to be?

14:22.133 --> 14:26.185
One Spanish Man of War.

14:28.889 --> 14:31.140
He can't do that even if he wanted to.

14:31.192 --> 14:32.524
That ship belongs to his men.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.309
Says the woman who managed

14:34.361 --> 14:36.061
to separate me from my last ship

14:36.113 --> 14:37.646
with just a few choice words.

14:37.648 --> 14:39.948
You want to see that girl alive,

14:39.984 --> 14:42.484
I suggest you not try and stop me.

14:42.536 --> 14:44.536
Among the men she is
surrounded by right now,

14:44.572 --> 14:48.740
I am quite certainly
the most reasonable one.

14:50.044 --> 14:52.161
I believe my terms are clear.

14:55.382 --> 14:58.167
You know where to find me
to deliver your response.

15:12.683 --> 15:15.317
Stop.

15:15.352 --> 15:17.152
You can't walk away from this.

15:21.192 --> 15:23.108
Were it anyone else in the world,

15:23.160 --> 15:25.994
you would see right through this.

15:26.030 --> 15:30.415
But that man starts talking
and you'll believe anything.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.117
You have a choice to make.

15:32.169 --> 15:34.620
It's long past due.

15:36.207 --> 15:38.874
Until then, there's nothing
for you and I to say.

15:51.972 --> 15:53.438
What are you doing?

15:53.474 --> 15:56.608
Parsing leads from the girls.

15:56.644 --> 15:58.560
Why? Should I be doing something else?

15:58.562 --> 16:01.480
You're telling me you
haven't heard what happened?

16:03.984 --> 16:06.451
The crew of the Eagle was
recruiting by the beach.

16:06.487 --> 16:09.571
Anne Bonny showed up looking to join.

16:13.127 --> 16:15.077
Quartermaster tells
her if Jack Rackham's

16:15.129 --> 16:16.578
got no appetite for her on his crew,

16:16.630 --> 16:18.914
they for fucking certain don't either.

16:21.635 --> 16:24.253
What did she do?

16:24.255 --> 16:27.556
She grabbed a marling spike
and plunged it in his jaw.

16:27.591 --> 16:29.224
Took out three teeth.

16:29.260 --> 16:32.394
Which brings me to my original question.

16:32.429 --> 16:34.813
What the hell are you doing here?

16:34.848 --> 16:36.765
Why aren't there men at your door?

16:36.767 --> 16:38.267
You are afraid she will come here

16:38.319 --> 16:40.435
and attempt to harm me.

16:40.487 --> 16:42.938
Everyone's heard what happened.

16:42.940 --> 16:46.325
Jack had a choice, pay you or keep her.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.826
He chose you.

16:47.861 --> 16:50.329
She's gone fucking mad over it.

16:50.364 --> 16:52.781
Idelle, how would you feel

16:52.783 --> 16:56.034
if the one man you thought
would never betray you did?

16:56.086 --> 16:59.454
If he purchased for himself a
future through that betrayal?

16:59.506 --> 17:02.174
If you were told by a world full of men

17:02.209 --> 17:04.509
that that betrayal confirmed for them

17:04.545 --> 17:08.463
that they were right to see
you as a monster to be shunned?

17:09.633 --> 17:12.467
She's not mad.

17:12.469 --> 17:13.935
She is adrift.

17:13.971 --> 17:17.856
Alone in the most terrifying way.

17:17.891 --> 17:20.892
What she will do next, I do not know.

17:20.944 --> 17:23.528
But I refuse to proclaim myself

17:23.564 --> 17:25.230
to be yet another one of her enemies

17:25.281 --> 17:28.483
by acting like I have
something to fear from her.

17:29.820 --> 17:33.455
If she returns, if the girls see her,

17:33.490 --> 17:36.124
tell them to allow her a wide berth

17:36.160 --> 17:38.627
and tell me at once.

17:44.168 --> 17:45.917
Logan's come up from the beach.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.757
Mr. Rackham was right.

17:51.809 --> 17:55.594
Flint forbade any of the
Walrus men from coming here.

17:55.646 --> 17:58.430
If the secret they are
hiding is that important,

17:58.482 --> 18:01.016
perhaps this is something
we should let alone.

18:01.068 --> 18:04.186
He has already brought
you into his confidence.

18:04.238 --> 18:07.272
Just show him you are calm.

18:07.324 --> 18:11.443
Let him talk and
everything will be fine.

18:11.495 --> 18:13.078
Hmm?

18:29.129 --> 18:32.381
I assume you're the one
who fetched Eleanor?

18:37.137 --> 18:38.637
Why didn't you just leave me there?

18:42.810 --> 18:44.226
I couldn't.

18:47.815 --> 18:48.897
Thank you.

18:50.651 --> 18:54.286
What happens in London?

18:54.321 --> 18:59.241
Assume your appeal to
Lord Ashe is persuasive.

18:59.293 --> 19:00.992
Assume you bring him here,

19:01.044 --> 19:02.794
show him that everything necessary

19:02.830 --> 19:06.081
to make Nassau a viable,
permanent colony

19:06.133 --> 19:08.417
is already in place and functioning.

19:08.469 --> 19:12.254
Then he has to make the
case to Parliament, yes?

19:12.306 --> 19:14.089
Yes.

19:14.141 --> 19:15.757
But while he's trying to persuade them

19:15.809 --> 19:19.428
that there are reasonable men
among the pirates of Nassau,

19:19.480 --> 19:23.432
men ready to govern themselves
responsibly and peacefully,

19:23.484 --> 19:24.933
no one will be listening,

19:24.935 --> 19:27.102
because in the next room

19:27.104 --> 19:30.272
the ambassador to the court
of King Philip of Spain

19:30.274 --> 19:33.408
will be shaking his fists with rage,

19:33.444 --> 19:37.279
screaming about how
these same reasonable men

19:37.331 --> 19:41.283
just stole five million Spanish
dollars from the king's treasury.

19:41.285 --> 19:44.286
He'll be demanding
Whitehall denounce the act

19:44.288 --> 19:49.291
or risk losing the hard-won
peace between both nations.

19:49.293 --> 19:53.628
If Lord Ashe is to have
any prayer of succeeding

19:53.630 --> 19:56.131
in what you are asking of him,

19:56.133 --> 19:59.468
not only can you not
retrieve the Urca gold,

19:59.470 --> 20:02.103
no one else here can retrieve it either.

20:02.139 --> 20:03.805
They saw it with their own eyes.

20:03.807 --> 20:07.142
In their minds,
half of it is spent already.

20:07.194 --> 20:12.364
To persuade them to let it go at
this point is an impossibility.

20:12.399 --> 20:14.783
I don't dispute that.

20:14.818 --> 20:19.287
But I would argue it is also
indisputable that these two plans,

20:19.323 --> 20:22.624
courting Lord Ashe and
retrieving the Urca gold,

20:22.659 --> 20:24.960
are working against each other.

20:24.995 --> 20:27.629
Perhaps even mutually
exclude each other.

20:27.664 --> 20:30.298
- I will make it work.
- How could you possibly?

20:30.334 --> 20:32.968
I don't know...

20:33.003 --> 20:34.003
yet.

20:38.976 --> 20:40.475
He agreed.

20:40.511 --> 20:42.677
He agreed?

20:42.729 --> 20:44.179
Abigail Ashe will be surrendered to you

20:44.231 --> 20:45.764
in exchange for which you will agree

20:45.816 --> 20:49.067
to make no further move
against him or the fort.

20:49.102 --> 20:51.436
He lives.

20:51.488 --> 20:53.522
I'm sorry,
but I'm having a difficult time

20:53.524 --> 20:55.023
believing that he agreed.

20:55.025 --> 20:56.608
He agreed, he didn't agree.

20:56.660 --> 20:58.276
What difference does it make?

20:58.328 --> 21:00.078
I am guaranteeing that the exchange

21:00.113 --> 21:01.696
you offered will be honored.

21:01.698 --> 21:03.665
Do you understand?

21:03.700 --> 21:05.617
You want me to go to my men

21:05.669 --> 21:07.202
and deny them a fight

21:07.254 --> 21:09.337
that I have led them
to believe is critical

21:09.373 --> 21:10.839
for the future of this place

21:10.874 --> 21:12.874
and do so based upon your word

21:12.876 --> 21:16.428
that Charles Vane will
compensate them for it?

21:16.463 --> 21:19.381
That is exactly what
I'm asking you to do.

21:19.433 --> 21:21.683
I'll say it again.

21:21.718 --> 21:24.553
I am guaranteeing the
terms of this deal.

21:26.139 --> 21:28.773
If you deliver on your promise,

21:28.809 --> 21:31.226
if you prevent any further
attack on the fort,

21:31.278 --> 21:33.478
I will bring the girl down from the hill

21:33.530 --> 21:35.063
and deliver her to you.

21:37.484 --> 21:39.568
Will you fulfill your
end of this bargain?

21:42.956 --> 21:44.573
Yes or no?

22:16.607 --> 22:19.190
- Do you recognize it?
- No.

22:19.242 --> 22:20.742
Not a Nassau crew.

22:37.961 --> 22:40.762
Let's get this underway, shall we?

22:43.800 --> 22:46.885
Captain Jack Rackham
of the Colonial Dawn.

22:48.138 --> 22:50.188
Never heard of you.

22:50.223 --> 22:51.973
Well, perhaps you should get out more.

23:04.705 --> 23:06.556
Good one.

23:07.574 --> 23:10.075
Captain Linus Harcourt of the Goliath.

23:12.162 --> 23:16.164
Your ship is named after the greatest
disappointment in the history of warfare?

23:17.668 --> 23:21.469
I like how it sounds.

23:21.505 --> 23:23.838
Pleasure to meet you.

23:26.476 --> 23:28.226
Have you ever done one of these before?

23:28.261 --> 23:31.930
Split a baby? No. No, I haven't.

23:31.982 --> 23:34.099
We've had a few.

23:34.151 --> 23:36.601
One of three outcomes, in my experience.

23:36.653 --> 23:39.604
One, crews fight it out.

23:39.656 --> 23:44.025
Seeing our obvious advantage
in strength of numbers,

23:44.027 --> 23:47.445
you're wise enough to forgo that option.

23:47.497 --> 23:50.415
Two, captains fight it out.

23:50.450 --> 23:52.450
Don't know about you,

23:52.502 --> 23:55.253
but this doesn't seem like a
haul worth dying over to me.

23:55.288 --> 23:56.371
Yeah, what's three?

23:58.291 --> 24:00.375
Reasonable men agree.

24:04.681 --> 24:06.522
The first thing I remember
is being in the hold

24:06.550 --> 24:09.100
of that ship, shackled.

24:09.136 --> 24:13.555
Then, um, a man came in.

24:15.308 --> 24:17.559
The Scarborough's captain.

24:19.312 --> 24:20.779
And he just said one thing.

24:20.814 --> 24:23.064
He said,

24:23.066 --> 24:27.035
"Yesterday, you were a free man.

24:27.070 --> 24:31.372
Today you are a thief
condemned to die."

24:32.576 --> 24:35.243
I saw a garrison on Harbour Island.

24:35.295 --> 24:37.912
200 men.

24:37.964 --> 24:42.417
I saw an armory, some barracks.

24:42.469 --> 24:46.254
They weren't passing through.

24:46.306 --> 24:49.390
The navy is, this moment,

24:49.426 --> 24:53.094
fully encamped 40 miles
away from where you stand.

24:58.985 --> 25:02.654
Eventually, the man
who guarded me got careless,

25:02.689 --> 25:04.322
let me get too close...

25:04.357 --> 25:09.444
Billy, we're all relieved
beyond words that you're here,

25:09.446 --> 25:12.781
but the question on all of
our minds in this moment

25:12.783 --> 25:16.751
is how did you end up in the
water in the first place?

25:18.789 --> 25:21.623
Mr. Gates assumed,
I assumed, we all assumed,

25:21.675 --> 25:24.292
the captain had a hand in your fall

25:24.294 --> 25:26.878
to silence your opposition to him.

25:28.965 --> 25:32.467
Do you remember what happened
on the bow of the Walrus that night?

25:41.778 --> 25:43.228
You ought to go.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.780
It'll take me a while to
straighten things out down there,

25:45.816 --> 25:49.901
but when I do, I'll be home...

25:51.655 --> 25:53.121
if you'll have me.

25:54.658 --> 25:56.875
I'm not going anywhere.

25:57.994 --> 25:59.577
What?

25:59.629 --> 26:02.297
Abigail doesn't know you.

26:02.332 --> 26:05.466
She doesn't know Miss Guthrie.

26:05.502 --> 26:07.669
She did know me once.

26:07.721 --> 26:11.089
There's a good chance she
might even recognize me.

26:11.141 --> 26:12.924
I would assume your plan would work best

26:12.976 --> 26:16.261
if she were cooperative in it,
if she felt safe.

26:16.313 --> 26:17.762
There's no better way to ensure that

26:17.814 --> 26:19.597
than having me be a part of it.

26:19.649 --> 26:22.016
Part of it? For how long?

26:22.068 --> 26:24.736
I don't know.

26:24.771 --> 26:27.739
Aren't we all just
figuring this out as we go?

26:30.660 --> 26:32.277
You and Peter weren't the only ones

26:32.329 --> 26:34.362
committed to seeing Nassau set aright.

26:34.414 --> 26:38.499
You weren't the only one who paid
a heavy toll towards that end.

26:38.535 --> 26:41.035
I stood aside too long.

26:43.290 --> 26:45.790
If you and I are to be partners...

26:47.961 --> 26:50.094
then we ought to be partners.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.015
Very well.

26:55.302 --> 26:57.218
Captain.

27:05.228 --> 27:07.278
There's been a development.

27:07.314 --> 27:10.114
I'm on my way down to the
beach to inform the men.

27:10.150 --> 27:12.116
Before you do that,

27:12.152 --> 27:14.903
there is something you need to know.

27:14.955 --> 27:17.572
There's been a development
down there, too.

27:57.447 --> 27:59.948
Where the fuck are you going?

28:02.786 --> 28:06.337
You got Flint's man up there,
is what I hear.

28:06.373 --> 28:07.789
I'm looking for Max.

28:07.791 --> 28:10.591
- I'm really not supposed to...
- Get him to talk?

28:13.513 --> 28:15.630
Are you fucking serious?

28:15.632 --> 28:17.632
You going to play games with me?

28:17.634 --> 28:19.801
What did he say to you?

28:19.803 --> 28:22.854
He said the gold is still out there.

28:24.474 --> 28:27.058
He said that Flint still
plans to go get it.

28:27.110 --> 28:31.029
Out there? Where the fuck is it?

28:31.064 --> 28:32.814
He wouldn't say.

28:32.866 --> 28:35.283
But he's coming back later tonight.

28:35.318 --> 28:36.784
Tonight.

28:36.820 --> 28:38.036
They cut me loose.

28:38.071 --> 28:40.038
But something this
important needs doing,

28:40.073 --> 28:42.290
leave a fucking whore to do it.

28:42.325 --> 28:44.792
I can go get it. I'm just being careful.

28:44.828 --> 28:46.077
Wait!

28:47.914 --> 28:51.249
Charlotte, I can't find my belt anywhere.

28:51.301 --> 28:52.717
You know who I am?

28:52.752 --> 28:55.003
I sure as shit know who you are.

28:55.005 --> 28:56.504
Fuck's the gold?

28:56.506 --> 28:57.672
Please don't.

28:57.724 --> 28:59.173
God damn it, Charlotte.

28:59.225 --> 29:00.508
Where the fuck is the gold?

29:00.510 --> 29:01.759
I'm getting Max.

29:01.811 --> 29:05.263
Don't move. I won't say it again.

29:05.315 --> 29:07.398
You want me to believe
you won't betray your men?

29:07.434 --> 29:09.150
Your friends?

29:09.185 --> 29:11.652
All men betray when it suits them.

29:11.688 --> 29:14.072
And right now I'd say
it'd fucking suit you.

29:14.107 --> 29:16.074
Fuck you.

29:19.029 --> 29:21.662
You won't fucking touch me.

29:21.698 --> 29:25.533
You know who my captain is?
Who my brothers are?

29:25.535 --> 29:27.001
Who the fuck are you?

29:27.037 --> 29:30.254
Some skinny little cunt without a crew.

29:31.424 --> 29:32.957
Not a fucking soul...

29:37.547 --> 29:39.464
What did you do?

29:39.516 --> 29:40.965
You fucking lunatic!

29:41.017 --> 29:42.433
What the fuck is wrong with you?

30:08.661 --> 30:10.912
First day as captain, is it?

30:10.964 --> 30:12.964
What makes you say that?

30:12.999 --> 30:14.799
Little things.

30:14.834 --> 30:16.501
A few looks from your men.

30:16.553 --> 30:19.420
They're curious how you'll handle this.

30:20.840 --> 30:22.840
Your banner.

30:22.892 --> 30:25.677
Something in the way
your men reacted to...

30:25.756 --> 30:28.312
The banner?
What's the matter with the banner?

30:28.348 --> 30:31.482
Well, it's new. Lightly traveled.

30:38.992 --> 30:42.192
Why? What do you think is wrong with it?

30:43.663 --> 30:45.696
It's fine.

30:48.001 --> 30:50.118
There. What do you think?

31:09.105 --> 31:10.638
Is this supposed to be a joke?

31:10.640 --> 31:11.722
What do you mean?

31:11.774 --> 31:14.142
This isn't remotely an even split.

31:14.194 --> 31:16.777
You get almost half the total tonnage.

31:16.813 --> 31:18.396
Yeah.

31:18.448 --> 31:20.148
The shit half.

31:20.150 --> 31:22.567
You get the tobacco and
sugar and I get what?

31:22.619 --> 31:25.987
Blankets, pots and pans.

31:25.989 --> 31:28.156
Your half of the tonnage

31:28.158 --> 31:31.075
is worth nine-tenths the value.

31:31.127 --> 31:34.328
It's closer to four-fifths.

31:34.330 --> 31:37.999
We agreed we would reach a
reasonable settlement here.

31:38.001 --> 31:40.501
As in an equitable result.

31:40.503 --> 31:43.888
As in a result based on reason.

31:45.842 --> 31:47.808
Had we come to blows over this prize,

31:47.844 --> 31:51.312
there's no doubt my men
would have won it whole.

31:51.347 --> 31:53.397
I'm offering you a meaningful share

31:53.433 --> 31:56.317
just for having got here first.

31:56.352 --> 31:57.818
It's the most I can spare

31:57.854 --> 32:00.354
without losing my men's faith in me.

32:03.243 --> 32:05.693
I know we have the advantage here.

32:05.745 --> 32:09.247
I can see your numbers.
I can see you.

32:12.702 --> 32:14.452
Did Billy say what happened?

32:14.504 --> 32:16.787
He was fished from the
water by the Scarborough,

32:16.839 --> 32:19.006
tortured, escaped.

32:19.042 --> 32:20.958
Did he say how he went into the water?

32:21.010 --> 32:24.295
Said he lost his footing. Said he fell.

32:24.347 --> 32:26.964
He said you tried to save him.

32:27.016 --> 32:29.350
And how did the crew
react to hearing that?

32:29.385 --> 32:31.185
Stunned surprise, I would say.

32:33.723 --> 32:36.057
Before the captain gets here,
there are some things

32:36.109 --> 32:37.942
I would like to discuss in private.

33:19.185 --> 33:21.769
It's good to have you back again.

33:25.325 --> 33:27.275
Captain!

33:36.669 --> 33:40.371
107 men have been standing on
this beach awaiting your return,

33:40.423 --> 33:43.541
waiting to complete the task to
which we've all bound ourselves.

33:43.593 --> 33:44.593
Waiting.

33:44.594 --> 33:46.294
Perhaps now that you are here,

33:46.346 --> 33:48.963
we might at long last reclaim my fort.

33:55.305 --> 33:57.972
Farad, take this to Hassan.

34:33.059 --> 34:34.975
I should go get the doorman.

34:35.011 --> 34:38.094
No. Stay there until I come out.

34:39.181 --> 34:40.764
You can't be in there alone.

35:08.177 --> 35:10.594
I think you know who that is.

35:13.182 --> 35:17.101
And who his friends are,
who his captain is.

35:19.939 --> 35:22.857
I think you know what this will provoke.

35:22.892 --> 35:24.558
I think you know how dangerous

35:24.560 --> 35:26.610
the consequences promise to be,

35:26.646 --> 35:30.398
and I think you knew that
before you took up the knife.

35:30.450 --> 35:32.616
I think I know why you did it,

35:32.652 --> 35:34.235
and I don't think it had anything to do

35:34.237 --> 35:38.873
with him or with her or with gold.

35:38.908 --> 35:42.243
I think it had to do with
something entirely different...

35:44.664 --> 35:46.580
and I understand.

35:48.050 --> 35:50.418
So I will not let those
consequences touch you.

35:54.590 --> 35:58.642
I will stand in between you and them,

35:58.678 --> 36:00.644
and I will protect you.

36:04.934 --> 36:07.685
So Vane stays in the fort.

36:07.737 --> 36:09.270
A fort with no ability

36:09.272 --> 36:12.106
to threaten the bay for weeks,
if not months.

36:12.158 --> 36:13.607
And therefore no ability

36:13.659 --> 36:16.444
to stop us bringing back
the Urca gold safely.

36:16.446 --> 36:20.448
As for Vane, I don't like leaving
him up there any more than you do.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.583
It's an awful compromise to be sure,

36:22.618 --> 36:26.454
but one well worth making given
what is being offered in return

36:26.506 --> 36:28.622
and what it promises for
the future of this place.

36:28.674 --> 36:31.926
How unsurprising that you
cast aside our arrangement

36:31.961 --> 36:33.594
the first moment it suited your whim.

36:33.629 --> 36:37.097
My priority has always
been and will always be

36:37.133 --> 36:39.884
the welfare of my men.

36:39.936 --> 36:42.970
And your good word being no
priority at all it would seem.

36:42.972 --> 36:44.638
A hard choice, sir,

36:44.640 --> 36:46.974
but one that any responsible
captain must make

36:46.976 --> 36:49.310
given the changing circumstances.

36:49.312 --> 36:52.480
I'm only sorry that you cannot see
past your own pride to join me.

36:52.482 --> 36:53.814
My pride?

36:53.816 --> 36:57.151
I've been a captain of men at sea
going on three decades,

36:57.153 --> 36:58.652
survived a war with Spain,

36:58.654 --> 37:01.205
an insurrection against a queen,

37:01.240 --> 37:02.873
a decade as an outlaw in a place

37:02.909 --> 37:05.075
where the weak and the
dead are one and the same.

37:05.127 --> 37:07.828
So the idea that you could choose
to discard our arrangement,

37:07.830 --> 37:09.630
that I would demur in the face

37:09.665 --> 37:12.166
of your unassailable rhetoric,

37:12.168 --> 37:14.552
either you've overestimated
yourself, sir,

37:14.587 --> 37:16.170
or you've underestimated me.

37:16.222 --> 37:17.805
Mr. Dufresne,

37:17.840 --> 37:20.307
as quartermaster of the
surviving Walrus crew,

37:20.343 --> 37:23.177
consider this notice and
relay to whom you must.

37:23.229 --> 37:25.145
Tonight I will call counsel

37:25.181 --> 37:27.982
and submit myself as captain
of this combined crew.

37:28.017 --> 37:29.733
My argument will be plain.

37:29.769 --> 37:33.487
I intend to lead the men in
retaking the fort as promised.

37:33.523 --> 37:36.156
I intend to hold Charles Vane
to account as promised.

37:36.192 --> 37:39.827
And then I intend
to sail for the Urca gold

37:39.862 --> 37:43.030
having ended your tyranny
over this place for good.

38:00.716 --> 38:03.350
Don't say a fucking word.
Just sit there and listen.

38:07.857 --> 38:09.473
You're right about me,

38:09.525 --> 38:11.809
about what I am.

38:11.861 --> 38:14.311
I am like you,

38:14.363 --> 38:18.816
so I know what you're feeling right now,

38:18.868 --> 38:22.202
that I'm asking you to weaken
yourself for someone else,

38:22.238 --> 38:26.040
for the island's sake, for my sake.

38:26.075 --> 38:27.625
But you're wrong.

38:27.660 --> 38:31.795
We control something so valuable,

38:31.831 --> 38:33.797
the whole of England wants it.

38:35.301 --> 38:37.835
We control Nassau,

38:37.887 --> 38:39.970
and the ransom we are
going to demand for her

38:40.006 --> 38:43.641
is going to be fucking enormous.

38:43.676 --> 38:47.428
More than money. More than land.

38:52.018 --> 38:53.934
Legitimacy.

38:56.989 --> 38:58.439
Legitimacy?

39:01.611 --> 39:04.862
England is going to give that to you?

39:04.914 --> 39:08.115
When they realize it is the only
outcome that makes any sense,

39:08.117 --> 39:10.284
they'll have to.

39:10.336 --> 39:13.787
And the moment they ratify
our control over this place,

39:13.839 --> 39:16.624
no more fighting, no more leads,

39:16.676 --> 39:18.792
no more chasing our fucking meals.

39:18.844 --> 39:22.630
I'm talking about making money
the way London makes money...

39:22.632 --> 39:25.933
collecting it, not hunting it,

39:25.968 --> 39:28.435
and in amounts that mean something.

39:34.644 --> 39:37.311
Give up the girl.

39:37.313 --> 39:40.481
Make this deal.

39:40.483 --> 39:42.983
Do this with me and we can
have a future here together.

39:42.985 --> 39:46.987
Eleanor, when I take
something from a man,

39:46.989 --> 39:50.991
his ship, his money, his life,

39:50.993 --> 39:53.160
I don't hide behind a clerk.

39:53.162 --> 39:55.329
I don't hide behind the law.

39:55.331 --> 39:58.332
I don't hide behind anything.

39:58.384 --> 40:00.968
I look him in his eye

40:01.003 --> 40:03.470
and I give him every chance to deny me.

40:03.506 --> 40:06.557
That is legitimate.

40:06.592 --> 40:08.676
I know what he wants you to believe,
but he's wrong.

40:08.728 --> 40:10.928
England's return isn't inevitable.

40:10.980 --> 40:12.429
England has no more appetite

40:12.481 --> 40:14.732
for taking this place back
today than it did yesterday,

40:14.767 --> 40:17.067
or last month, or last year,

40:17.103 --> 40:21.271
because they know it is inhabited
by too many men like me,

40:21.323 --> 40:25.776
men who would die before being
another man's slave again.

40:27.780 --> 40:29.747
Side with Flint,

40:29.782 --> 40:32.366
beg them to let you keep
what is already yours,

40:32.368 --> 40:34.535
show them that weakness,

40:34.587 --> 40:37.671
and you'll invite the very
outcome you wish to avoid.

40:37.707 --> 40:40.040
Side with me and we will show England

40:40.092 --> 40:42.342
that this place has never been stronger,

40:42.378 --> 40:44.878
and we'll keep our
freedom for another day,

40:44.930 --> 40:48.682
another month, another year, a lifetime.

40:48.718 --> 40:50.634
Hey.

40:54.106 --> 40:56.273
Do you believe me?

41:21.584 --> 41:23.584
You're right.

41:23.586 --> 41:25.219
It's nowhere near an even split.

41:27.089 --> 41:30.424
My God, this is...

41:30.426 --> 41:33.177
really quite disappointing.

41:36.432 --> 41:38.816
I say we take it.

41:38.851 --> 41:40.068
What?

41:40.770 --> 41:42.302
What?

41:42.438 --> 41:44.988
You're not concerned how
the men will receive this?

41:46.442 --> 41:48.108
What other choice do we have?

41:48.110 --> 41:52.663
Start a fight that gets
our whole crew slaughtered?

41:52.698 --> 41:55.249
I suppose you could challenge
him to fight you man to man,

41:55.284 --> 41:57.417
but I think we can both agree

41:57.453 --> 41:59.253
that's not going to end well for anyone.

42:01.507 --> 42:04.958
At the end of the day,
our men can count.

42:05.010 --> 42:07.094
Most of them can count.

42:07.129 --> 42:09.296
They can all see that we're
simply outmatched here.

42:09.348 --> 42:14.017
And they know that... well, you know...

42:15.354 --> 42:17.554
They know what?

42:17.606 --> 42:20.891
That they chose you as a captain
to get access to the whore's leads.

42:20.943 --> 42:22.643
If they're honest with themselves,

42:22.695 --> 42:25.863
they can't really expect you to
be able to do anything about this.

42:25.898 --> 42:28.232
Leads or no, if I accept these terms,

42:28.284 --> 42:31.702
they'll vote me off before
we return to Nassau.

42:31.737 --> 42:32.737
Hmm?

42:38.794 --> 42:41.495
You cannot imagine what I've
sacrificed to gain this captaincy.

42:41.547 --> 42:42.996
I may have lost the only person

42:43.048 --> 42:47.801
in the world I cared for
to gain this captaincy.

42:47.837 --> 42:49.837
I cannot lose it.

42:52.591 --> 42:54.508
Not so soon. Not like this.

43:44.944 --> 43:46.226
You're right.

43:46.278 --> 43:49.313
This is likely the most
reasonable distribution

43:49.365 --> 43:50.781
given our relative strengths.

43:52.368 --> 43:56.653
Then can we consider ourselves
in agreement about our terms?

43:56.705 --> 44:00.073
With one or two small adjustments,

44:00.125 --> 44:01.625
if you wouldn't mind hearing me out.

44:01.660 --> 44:02.910
Of course.

44:02.962 --> 44:06.246
For what little comfort
it may provide right now,

44:06.248 --> 44:08.498
I believe you've made
the right decision.

44:09.585 --> 44:11.001
Your men will see the wisdom...

44:33.075 --> 44:37.077
Thank you for offering us a way forward.

45:26.495 --> 45:27.961
Wait!

45:27.997 --> 45:29.963
Wait, wait, wait.

45:29.999 --> 45:31.381
Wait!

45:34.086 --> 45:35.335
Wait!

45:36.588 --> 45:39.389
I'm sorry, friends.

45:39.425 --> 45:42.809
I had hoped to find an outcome
amenable to both crews.

45:45.264 --> 45:48.849
But it seems that this man

45:48.901 --> 45:53.353
was unable to see any outcome

45:53.405 --> 45:58.191
that saw a single member of
this prize crew to survive.

46:00.746 --> 46:05.415
And that was an outcome that
I could simply not abide.

46:05.451 --> 46:09.369
I can only hope our new
brothers will join us

46:09.421 --> 46:10.954
in the fight for their own survival.

46:11.006 --> 46:13.206
Mr. Haines,
remove their restraints, please.

46:13.258 --> 46:16.009
Remove their restraints now!

46:16.045 --> 46:18.545
Every man from that prize crew.

46:23.052 --> 46:27.888
Unless there is a man amongst this crew

46:27.890 --> 46:31.441
who can sit down with me at
this table and speak reasonably,

46:31.477 --> 46:33.610
honorably,

46:33.645 --> 46:36.313
to reach a resolution more favorable...

46:36.365 --> 46:40.734
in light, of course, of the
overwhelming odds now in our favor...

46:47.993 --> 46:49.576
Anybody?

46:50.913 --> 46:52.379
Come on!

46:56.418 --> 46:58.218
Anyone?

47:33.288 --> 47:37.457
You have heard I'm
supporting Captain Flint

47:37.509 --> 47:40.427
against Captain Hornigold tonight, yeah?

47:40.462 --> 47:42.095
I've heard.

47:42.131 --> 47:44.965
I'm not sure I understand after
everything that's transpired,

47:45.017 --> 47:46.850
but I've heard.

47:51.807 --> 47:53.807
Flint was right.

47:56.028 --> 47:58.728
England is coming.

47:58.780 --> 48:01.148
I've seen them.

48:01.200 --> 48:02.816
I've seen how they see us.

48:02.868 --> 48:05.402
We aren't criminals to them.

48:05.454 --> 48:07.487
We aren't even men.

48:07.489 --> 48:09.656
We're animals.

48:09.658 --> 48:13.410
If Flint can do as he's promised,

48:13.462 --> 48:15.545
protect this place,

48:15.581 --> 48:18.999
protect us from ever
having to face that day,

48:19.001 --> 48:22.002
how can we do anything but support him?

48:22.054 --> 48:25.005
And if he cannot?

48:25.057 --> 48:28.008
Are you suggesting
there's an alternative?

48:40.105 --> 48:42.072
I didn't escape.

48:44.860 --> 48:47.277
From the navy.

48:47.329 --> 48:49.496
I didn't escape.

48:53.669 --> 48:56.336
The captain of the Scarborough

48:56.371 --> 48:58.872
made me an offer.

48:58.924 --> 49:02.042
He offered me and nine men

49:02.044 --> 49:04.377
of my choosing full pardons.

49:04.429 --> 49:07.464
He placed them on the table
right in front of my eyes.

49:07.516 --> 49:11.801
Said I could have them if, in exchange,

49:11.853 --> 49:14.387
I would aid him

49:14.389 --> 49:16.556
in the capture of a
fugitive from justice.

49:18.477 --> 49:22.862
One particular fugitive.

49:27.653 --> 49:30.737
If we doubt

49:30.739 --> 49:33.456
Flint's ability to do as he's promised,

49:33.492 --> 49:37.294
if we doubt he's the man to save us,

49:37.329 --> 49:41.381
then you and I and eight other men

49:41.416 --> 49:43.416
have another option.

49:43.418 --> 49:46.753
We subdue Flint

49:46.755 --> 49:48.672
and we deliver him to Harbour Island.

49:51.677 --> 49:53.893
And then...

49:53.929 --> 49:57.731
we put this whole
fucking mess behind us.

50:12.781 --> 50:15.081
You seem unconcerned.

50:16.952 --> 50:18.418
If I understand correctly,

50:18.453 --> 50:21.288
the stakes of the upcoming
vote are significant.

50:21.340 --> 50:22.589
What exactly are you doing?

50:22.624 --> 50:25.959
I'm seeming unconcerned.

50:26.011 --> 50:29.262
I cannot think of a better way
to aid Captain Hornigold's cause

50:29.298 --> 50:31.298
than to appear panicked about it.

50:31.300 --> 50:35.051
No, that would be my job, I suppose.

50:37.472 --> 50:39.189
What were the numbers of the last count?

50:39.224 --> 50:41.641
I'd say you have at
least a half dozen votes

50:41.643 --> 50:44.311
over Captain Hornigold at the moment.

50:44.313 --> 50:45.862
That isn't nearly enough.

50:45.897 --> 50:49.032
He's a desperate man.
Even with a minority faction,

50:49.067 --> 50:53.903
he might still move on Vane,
in which case the girl dies.

50:53.955 --> 50:56.323
I need him to lose so convincingly

50:56.325 --> 50:59.159
that no sane man would follow
him two yards up that beach.

51:00.712 --> 51:03.496
A margin of 20 would help matters.

51:04.833 --> 51:06.666
Don't stop moving until you have it.

51:14.559 --> 51:17.894
There is one particular vote

51:17.929 --> 51:20.513
I'm having some trouble with.

51:20.515 --> 51:22.649
Perhaps you could help me with it.

51:22.684 --> 51:25.185
Whose vote is that?

51:26.271 --> 51:28.054
Mine.

51:28.323 --> 51:30.440
When we returned here,
you said it would be a week,

51:30.492 --> 51:32.992
maybe two,
before Spanish reinforcements arrived

51:33.028 --> 51:34.411
and that gold was as good as gone.

51:34.446 --> 51:36.279
Yes.

51:36.331 --> 51:38.123
So what happens if we win the vote

51:38.124 --> 51:40.619
and the gold isn't delivered
in a timely fashion?

51:40.620 --> 51:42.508
Vane reneges.

51:42.509 --> 51:44.858
Delays to achieve better terms.
Certainly these are plausible outcomes.

51:44.889 --> 51:47.590
How long do we wait for the
situation to resolve itself?

51:47.642 --> 51:49.475
The gold is still a priority.

51:49.511 --> 51:51.678
There's been no change in that.

51:53.848 --> 51:55.732
You have my word.

52:05.777 --> 52:07.527
That's all I needed to hear.

52:09.198 --> 52:11.698
I should get to work.

52:11.750 --> 52:13.366
I'll keep you apprised of the numbers.

52:13.418 --> 52:14.501
You do that.

52:25.681 --> 52:28.431
Mr. Silver, a moment.

52:28.467 --> 52:29.883
How can I help?

52:29.885 --> 52:32.302
You're doing a nose count
for the captain, yes?

52:32.354 --> 52:34.554
I am.

52:34.606 --> 52:36.940
You're gonna find your
tally a man short.

52:36.975 --> 52:39.276
Why?

52:39.311 --> 52:41.361
Who isn't here?

52:48.904 --> 52:50.654
Where's the madam?

52:53.895 --> 52:55.575
Excuse me,
but I'm going to need your help.

52:55.577 --> 52:57.744
Hello.

52:59.164 --> 53:00.914
Sorry, I was looking for the madam.

53:00.966 --> 53:02.499
You found her.

53:04.336 --> 53:07.337
Somehow, I'm not surprised.

53:07.389 --> 53:10.674
Seems quite a bit has transpired since
last we were in business together.

53:10.726 --> 53:12.309
And I would love to hear all about it,

53:12.344 --> 53:14.227
but at the moment I'm
a bit pressed for time.

53:14.263 --> 53:16.229
So if you could do me a
favor and send Mr. Logan

53:16.265 --> 53:18.265
back to camp, that would be a huge help.

53:19.768 --> 53:23.103
Mr. Logan? I don't believe he's here.

53:23.105 --> 53:25.522
Oh, he's here. And he's not in trouble.

53:25.574 --> 53:28.275
But that could change
quickly if certain people

53:28.277 --> 53:30.577
were to learn he's here.

53:30.612 --> 53:33.163
So please, send him down.

53:42.708 --> 53:45.292
What the fuck happened here?

53:45.294 --> 53:46.793
Does it matter?

53:46.795 --> 53:49.262
A man dies under this roof,
it is my responsibility

53:49.298 --> 53:51.097
whatever the circumstances.

53:51.133 --> 53:52.632
You've lost a valued crew member

53:52.684 --> 53:55.135
and restitution will be made.
I will see to it.

53:55.137 --> 53:57.771
My crewmates were expressly
forbidden from entering this place.

53:57.806 --> 53:59.306
I imagine you noticed.

53:59.358 --> 54:01.308
And I imagine you can guess

54:01.360 --> 54:03.560
it's because there's information
those men are privy to

54:03.612 --> 54:05.812
that we'd just as soon not have
plied out of them by your girls.

54:05.814 --> 54:08.148
Now my armorer is dead on your floor

54:08.200 --> 54:11.151
and I'm forced to wonder if
those two things aren't related.

54:11.203 --> 54:13.236
How exactly did you plan
on covering this up?

54:13.288 --> 54:16.206
I told you, I have every intention
of seeing this made right.

54:16.241 --> 54:17.707
Time is not our friend here.

54:17.743 --> 54:19.659
Please, something resembling the truth.

54:21.296 --> 54:23.046
I don't know.

54:23.081 --> 54:24.964
Something about them falling in love,

54:25.000 --> 54:26.633
running away together.

54:26.668 --> 54:28.635
That's as far as I had got.

54:31.890 --> 54:33.840
He went to Providence.

54:33.892 --> 54:35.342
I'm sorry?

54:37.012 --> 54:40.347
Logan was among a number of
men who deserted this morning.

54:40.399 --> 54:43.350
Unwilling to risk dying in a
bloody fight to retake the fort,

54:43.352 --> 54:45.268
he and his love fled together.

54:45.320 --> 54:46.853
I heard he has a brother in Providence.

54:46.855 --> 54:48.271
Not surprised that's where he went.
Are you following?

54:48.323 --> 54:49.856
- Yes.
- Good.

54:53.528 --> 54:55.412
Clean this up.

54:55.447 --> 54:58.198
If anyone asks if I saw this up here,
I don't intend to lie.

54:59.418 --> 55:02.502
Why would you do that? Help me?

55:04.206 --> 55:07.040
The last thing I need right now
is Flint in the middle of this.

55:07.092 --> 55:10.176
If he or any of the men in his
crew were to learn about it,

55:10.212 --> 55:12.846
my life would get
significantly more complicated.

55:12.881 --> 55:15.382
Any of the men?

55:15.434 --> 55:17.851
Aren't you one of the men on his crew?

55:20.055 --> 55:22.722
Clean this up, please.

56:24.453 --> 56:26.669
Abigail.

56:26.705 --> 56:28.838
My name is Eleanor.

56:28.874 --> 56:31.458
You are no longer a hostage.

56:35.063 --> 56:37.196
I'm gonna get you out of here.
