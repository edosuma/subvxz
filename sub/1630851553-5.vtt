[man] The horse world
is a very exclusive place.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.764
Many of the owners are millionaires,

00:14.848 --> 00:17.726
and the horses are worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.353
On the surface,
it's a very pristine world.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.481
But as an FBI agent…

…I uncovered fraud,
corruption, and killings

[reporter 1] A gruesome conspiracy
has shaken the horse show industry.

00:40.415 --> 00:43.626
Federal investigators say those named
were motivated by greed and money.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.672
It was like turning a rock over
and seeing everything underneath.

Horse shows is not where you might expect
to hear talk of fraud and hit men.

00:52.761 --> 00:57.307
Prominent equestrians across the country
needed someone to do their dirty business.

00:57.390 --> 01:01.102
[reporter 2] The hitman was paid up
to $35,000 per killing.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.313
He got the nickname "the Sandman."

You wanted something done,

[man] In 1990, I was working
as an FBI agent in Chicago, Illinois.

02:04.916 --> 02:08.545
And I was assigned an investigation
into the equestrian world.

02:09.546 --> 02:13.424
There had been rumors for some time
that this industry had been corrupt,

02:13.508 --> 02:14.926
but no one would come forward.

02:16.928 --> 02:20.223
[Cullen] So it was very difficult
to penetrate a very closed system.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.477
[phone ringing]

02:24.561 --> 02:29.190

a Florida Department of Agriculture agent.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.441
[sirens wail]

02:30.525 --> 02:34.988
[Cullen] They had arrested a man fleeing
the scene of a crime at a horse show.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.199
His name was Tommy Burns.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.578
The agent described Tommy Burns
as the Sandman.

02:42.453 --> 02:46.791
A violent enforcer hired by rich horse
owners who didn't want their hands dirty.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.293

02:50.336 --> 02:53.006
[Cullen] I flew down to Florida
to interview Tommy.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.966
I knew if we could get Tommy to talk,

02:55.466 --> 02:58.219
it would open the doors
to this investigation.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.977
[Cullen] The prison contained
a lot of murderers and drug dealers,

03:06.060 --> 03:09.981
and some of the worst criminals
were housed in this location.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.400
And that's where Tommy Burns was.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.743
my first thought was

03:21.826 --> 03:22.785
wise guy,

03:23.369 --> 03:24.245

03:24.329 --> 03:25.455

03:26.247 --> 03:27.373
[music crescendos]

03:27.916 --> 03:30.126
[Tommy] I didn't say anything at all.

03:30.210 --> 03:34.464
I wasn't stupid by any means to think
that they came down here just for fun.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.549
I had been questioned by cops.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.968
This isn't the first go-around
with these people.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.511
[grim music plays]

03:40.595 --> 03:43.223
[Cullen] I told Tommy,
"If you say nothing,

03:43.306 --> 03:45.892
you're going to stay
in this prison for a long time.

03:45.975 --> 03:49.437
But if you cooperate with us,
we can talk to the judge

You know, they get you a lawyer,
they bail you out.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.159
Everything would be okay.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.577
[cell door slides shut]

04:05.578 --> 04:09.582
Tommy's bail was coming up the next day,
and it was set at $100,000.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.754
A $100,000 was a lot of money.

04:15.838 --> 04:19.801
But I thought with my millionaire friends,
there was no doubt I would get out.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.136
[dramatic music plays]

04:22.720 --> 04:25.056

I called a lot of millionaires

a couple hundred miles away, and nobody,

04:37.151 --> 04:40.113

came up and did nothing.

04:41.406 --> 04:45.910
I couldn't believe how these rat-fuckers
really could just leave you in there.

04:45.994 --> 04:52.208
I was mad. I really believed my whole life
in that stand-up guy bullshit,

04:52.292 --> 04:54.669
that you shut your mouth
and everything would be all right.

04:54.752 --> 04:59.007
All that stuff I believed in up till then
turned into all bullshit.

and he was very desperate.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.106
I decided to sign a deal with the feds.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.652
[Tommy] It was a sweet deal,
but it was a tough deal.

05:22.780 --> 05:27.368
I had to tell them about
every crime I ever committed.

05:28.703 --> 05:32.373
Thousands of crimes, but I was
only going to be charged on one.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.876
But if I got caught lying to them,

05:35.543 --> 05:39.464
I would be charged on everything
I had told them about.

[Tommy] For every felony I had ever done,
I could get life.

05:46.971 --> 05:50.266
[Cullen] It was imperative
that he tell us the complete truth.

05:50.350 --> 05:54.979
If he held back information,
his value as a witness would be nullified.

05:55.063 --> 05:58.024
[grim music plays]

05:58.900 --> 06:02.612
[Tommy] As much as I signed a deal
with them and I didn't like it,

06:03.446 --> 06:05.865
I didn't tell on everybody. [sighs]

06:08.326 --> 06:11.746
[woman] He was known as a "flipper,"
that's what we would call Tommy,

06:11.829 --> 06:14.165

and was working with the government.

06:14.248 --> 06:16.167
I knew he was a difficult witness.

06:16.250 --> 06:19.045
I had heard that,
but I didn't know a whole lot.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.343
[Cox] My primary responsibility
was to find corroboration

06:25.426 --> 06:27.887
for the things that Tommy would say.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.723
If you're going to put somebody
on the stand like Tommy,

06:30.807 --> 06:32.642
you need to know what made him tick,

06:32.725 --> 06:36.479
why did he end up doing what he did
as opposed to doing something else?

06:36.562 --> 06:39.774
[grim music playing]

06:39.857 --> 06:43.486
[Cox] So it was really important
to understand where Tommy came from.

06:43.986 --> 06:46.739
Because if you
don't understand the beginning,

06:46.823 --> 06:49.283
you can't understand
the middle or the end either.

You know,
I don't like talking about this much.

06:54.288 --> 06:58.334

this in 30 years. It's an awful story.

their boots off so they'd look shiny.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.924
Kind of reminded me
of somewhere between a…

12:39.425 --> 12:42.678
Clint Eastwood
and a Charles Bronson-type character.

12:42.762 --> 12:43.888
When I walk in the ring,

12:43.971 --> 12:46.682
I think it's quite apparent.
I mean, every time I walk in,

12:46.766 --> 12:49.059
I want to win. I hate second.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.312
I hate third. I am not a good loser.

12:53.397 --> 12:54.648
[indistinct crowd noise]

12:54.732 --> 12:57.067
[Tommy] He was absolutely fearless.

12:57.151 --> 13:00.070
[applause and cheers]

13:00.154 --> 13:04.033
He would just come up to these fences
like this and just go straight up.

13:05.868 --> 13:06.952
[indistinct chatter]

13:07.787 --> 13:09.789
[cheering and applause]

13:09.872 --> 13:13.125
[sweeping orchestral music plays]

13:20.299 --> 13:22.134
[Tommy] I was just in awe.

13:34.396 --> 13:37.566
[Tommy] I approached him
and asked him if he needed any help.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.570
He looked at me and said,
"How old are you?"

13:41.654 --> 13:46.408
And he asked me if I could drive
and I don't even know if I had…

13:47.660 --> 13:50.412
I'm trying to think
if I had my driver's license or not.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.789
I said, "Yeah, I can drive."

13:51.872 --> 13:53.958
He said, "Would you like to work for me?"

13:54.458 --> 13:55.376
And, uh,

13:55.918 --> 13:59.004
I was tickled to death.
To me, it was like hitting the lottery

13:59.088 --> 14:01.590
when he offered me a job.
I was like, "Yep, absolutely."

14:01.674 --> 14:05.135
[gentle music plays]

14:05.219 --> 14:07.221
[Tommy] So we went back
to Bedford, New York.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.516
And I worked and I worked and I worked.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.518
Oh, this guy worked me hard.

14:13.853 --> 14:18.858
[Tommy] Barney had me driving
18-wheelers when I was 17 years old,

14:18.941 --> 14:20.359
but I enjoyed it there.

14:21.652 --> 14:24.572
He trained horses
and he sold a lot of horses.

14:26.031 --> 14:30.035
[Tommy] What was impressive about Barney
was that he wasn't privileged.

14:30.119 --> 14:33.414
A lot of these riders
were doctors' kids in this and that.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.957
Barney grew up hard.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.834
[applause and cheers]

14:36.917 --> 14:37.793
[crowd groans]

14:37.877 --> 14:39.670
[Ward] You got a horse
that weighs 1,200 pounds

14:39.753 --> 14:42.214
and if that horse falls on you,
he breaks things.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.550
I've broke my leg. I've broke my neck. Um…

14:44.633 --> 14:46.886
I've never got hurt
like I've been hurt in riding.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.429
[indistinct chatter]

14:48.512 --> 14:51.724
[Tommy] As a young guy,
I needed somebody like Barney.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.767
He was good. He'd put his foot down on me.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.896
He knew I was scared of him,
and I think I needed that.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.231
Barney was the father I always wanted.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.191
I looked up at him like he was…

15:02.359 --> 15:05.571
He-- Like he was a god or something.
I adored the guy.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.490
I'd have done anything to impress him.

15:10.075 --> 15:13.078
[playful music]

15:13.162 --> 15:16.206
[Tommy] That summer,
Barney had a body cast on him

15:17.082 --> 15:20.836
because he got thrown off
a horse and broke his neck.

15:21.837 --> 15:24.715
[ball rolling, pins knocking]

15:24.798 --> 15:27.551
[Tommy] One night we were
at a bowling alley, and, uh,

15:28.135 --> 15:31.055
one guy came up
and tapped him on the back of his cast

15:31.138 --> 15:34.016
and said, "Trick or treat."
Barney was kinda pissed.

15:34.099 --> 15:38.145
I thought, "Here's my opportunity."
I wanted to show him I was on his side.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.565
[Tommy]
I picked up a bowling ball and threw it.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.401
And I hit the guy in the ribs.

15:45.569 --> 15:46.946
Knocked him on the ground.

15:47.571 --> 15:51.784
Barney and I, we ran out the side door,
made our way to the car.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.495
I got in the back seat
and he turned around,

15:54.578 --> 15:56.914
told me I was the craziest
son of a bitch he ever met.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.707
[playful music]

15:58.791 --> 16:02.252
[Tommy] But then about a month later,
I saw a car I wanted.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.922
And Barney bought it for me.

16:06.090 --> 16:09.510
I couldn't believe it.
The nicest thing anybody ever done for me.

16:09.593 --> 16:12.513
There was no attachments.
He just wanted me to have a nice car.

16:13.722 --> 16:16.684
[Tommy] That day I felt like
I became part of the family.

16:16.767 --> 16:20.396
And having that bond
really meant everything to me with him.

16:21.188 --> 16:24.149
[deck humming, squeaking]

16:24.233 --> 16:27.194
[somber instrumental music plays]

16:27.277 --> 16:30.614
[Cullen] During the interview,
Tommy spoke very highly of Barney.

16:32.741 --> 16:35.077
Someone who he had strong loyalties to.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.999
That gave me great insight
into the type of person

16:40.082 --> 16:42.001
I'm dealing with here as a cooperator.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.797
Through Barney,
we knew he was closely connected

16:46.880 --> 16:49.425
to a number of individuals
in the horse industry.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.637
We'd ask Tommy questions like,
"Who else were you working for?"

16:55.764 --> 16:57.599
[Cullen] But Tommy was very guarded.

16:57.683 --> 17:01.228
It was just-- It was hard
to extract information from him.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.523
I was asking Tommy,

17:04.606 --> 17:07.276
"How did you get involved
in this criminal activity?"

17:07.359 --> 17:09.028
Like, how did it all begin?

17:11.697 --> 17:14.033
It started when I went
to work for Jim Druck.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.578
[dramatic music plays]

17:17.661 --> 17:20.414
[metal squeaking]

17:20.497 --> 17:23.709
[Tommy] A friend put me in touch
with a rich lawyer in Florida

17:24.376 --> 17:27.671
who was looking for somebody
to take care of his horses.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.466
It was three times
what Barney was paying me.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.092
I didn't have to work as hard.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.635
[insects chirping]

17:33.719 --> 17:36.430
[Tommy] So I told Barney,
but he wouldn't have it.

17:36.513 --> 17:37.347
[horse neighs]

17:37.431 --> 17:39.600
Didn't want to hear about it,
wasn't gonna let me.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.435
[music builds]

17:41.518 --> 17:44.688
I realized I was never
gonna get out of there in a civil manner.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.649
So I got up about three in the morning.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.193
[music builds]

17:49.276 --> 17:51.320
I had to just get on the road and go.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.362
[Tommy sighs]

17:52.446 --> 17:56.158
[somber music plays]

18:00.204 --> 18:01.538
[Tommy] I really felt bad.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.000
It was like leaving your family.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.716
But I wanted to go on with my life.
It was time to make a move.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.177
[gentle orchestral music playing]

18:18.514 --> 18:19.556
[brakes squealing]

18:19.640 --> 18:21.850
[Tommy] When I arrived
at Eagle's Nest Farm,

18:23.393 --> 18:25.646
it was huge and it was beautiful. [sighs]

18:27.231 --> 18:29.483
[gentle music rising]

18:29.566 --> 18:33.403
[Tommy] It was something I had never seen.
It looked like a movie or something.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.532
[music builds]

18:36.615 --> 18:38.492
[Tommy] I pulled up to his house,

18:38.575 --> 18:40.369
Jim came out and I talked to him,

18:40.452 --> 18:42.621
his wife came out
and a couple of the kids,

18:42.704 --> 18:45.082
and he had four daughters.
They were all pretty.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.045
To me, it was a picture-perfect family.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.551
[woman] Our family was financially stable,

18:56.135 --> 18:58.971
but emotionally unstable.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.517
It was filled with, um,

19:04.935 --> 19:08.313
emotional turmoil underneath the surface.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.859
[Rielle] My father was a defense attorney,

19:11.942 --> 19:17.739
he represented insurance companies,
and he was not emotionally attentive.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.700
My mother,

19:20.742 --> 19:24.663
bless her heart, was very sweet
when she wasn't drinking,

19:24.746 --> 19:27.416
and a little crazy.

19:28.167 --> 19:32.171
So every kind of peace and fulfillment

19:33.505 --> 19:35.966
that I had as a child came from horses.

19:36.049 --> 19:38.594
[moody music playing]

19:38.677 --> 19:41.096
[Rielle] It put me into a zone

19:41.180 --> 19:44.391
of just being present
and of being in peace.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.314
For people who have that connection,

19:50.939 --> 19:53.525
how much money they cost,
it doesn't matter.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.821
Because they are a part of you.

20:02.159 --> 20:06.246
Horses enabled me to survive

20:06.788 --> 20:07.831
amongst people.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.666
[laughs]

20:12.002 --> 20:14.004
Rielle was a very talented rider,

20:14.087 --> 20:17.049
and her dad kept buying her
better and better horses.

20:17.132 --> 20:20.135
In 1981, he purchased
his most expensive horse.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.556
A show hunter by the name of
Henry the Hawk.

20:24.640 --> 20:29.519
I think it was $150,000,
which was a lot of money for a horse,

20:29.603 --> 20:32.105
but he was one of the top hunters
in the country at the time.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.106
[bridle jingling]

20:34.149 --> 20:38.695
I got on him, and I think I might
have jumped about four jumps

20:38.779 --> 20:40.364
and it was a match made in heaven.

20:40.447 --> 20:43.492
[gentle music rises]

20:43.575 --> 20:45.160
He was the bomb.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.955
The bomb dot com that Henry the Hawk.

20:48.038 --> 20:48.914
[laughs]

20:50.249 --> 20:53.502
[cheers and applause]

20:53.585 --> 20:56.964
[Burke] I remember him
competing against my horse.

20:58.632 --> 21:02.135
The minute he walked into the ring,
he caught your attention

21:02.219 --> 21:05.305
'cause he had such a presence.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.849
-He was very competitive.
-[crowd cheers]

21:07.933 --> 21:11.895
[Rielle] He was all about showing off.
You know, turning to the last jump,

21:11.979 --> 21:15.857
his whole posture would change,
he was like, "I won this, I got this."

21:15.941 --> 21:18.819
I'd be, "Easy, dude,
we got one more jump to go." [laughs]

21:18.902 --> 21:21.822
[bright music plays]

21:21.905 --> 21:25.659
[exclamations, cheers, applause]

21:27.452 --> 21:31.206
[Tommy] I liked Rielle, we were friends.
We were close, you know what I mean?

21:31.290 --> 21:35.085
You know, she was a cute girl,
and I think she kind of liked me a little.

21:36.336 --> 21:42.801
Tommy was someone who worked for my father
and was around my house a lot, you know?

21:44.136 --> 21:48.515
He inserted himself into the family.
I wouldn't consider him a friend.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.980
[Tommy] Jim Druck, he was a good man
to work for, he treated me well.

21:55.063 --> 21:58.984
And Jim says, "Look, my family's
going on the road this summer

21:59.067 --> 22:02.904
with their horses. I'm staying here.
I need you to keep an eye on them."

22:02.988 --> 22:05.741
Basically keep them away
from guys like me.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.743
[honky-tonk music plays]

22:07.826 --> 22:10.078
[Tommy] So we traveled around the country,

22:10.162 --> 22:14.666
Ohio, Virginia, New York,
Tennessee, Georgia, Wisconsin.

22:14.750 --> 22:18.211
My job was to take care of the horses,
drive the truck,

22:18.295 --> 22:19.921
and to keep an eye on his girls.

22:23.633 --> 22:24.926
[Tommy] I was 19.

22:25.010 --> 22:28.847
and, uh, you know how 19-year-olds can be.

22:28.930 --> 22:32.059
[honky-tonk music rises]

22:32.142 --> 22:34.102
[Tommy] Jim's wife was very attractive.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.230
She'd tended to drink
a little bit too much at night.

22:38.023 --> 22:42.069
She kind of one day put the moves on me
and just one thing led to another.

22:42.152 --> 22:45.280
And I thought it was gonna turn
into a one-night deal.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.573
It kind of didn't.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.033
[guitar wails]

22:48.116 --> 22:49.951
[honky-tonk music plays]

22:50.035 --> 22:53.955
[Tommy] I was making almost 100,000 a year
and I couldn't spend it fast enough.

22:54.039 --> 22:54.915
I, uh--

22:54.998 --> 23:00.462
I blew it on cars, a lot of liquor.
But I got very cocky with that money too.

23:01.046 --> 23:04.508
I bought a Rolex, started wearing
Ralph Lauren stuff like everybody else,

23:04.591 --> 23:07.427
and all of a sudden when you had
the same stuff as these people

23:07.511 --> 23:09.388
you've kind of blended and you fit in.

23:09.471 --> 23:13.016
It was strange, but deep down
I was still Tommy Burns.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.142
[honky-tonk plays]

23:14.226 --> 23:16.561
[Rielle] When he had a couple drinks,
he was scary.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.146
He carried brass knuckles.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.190
[indistinct chatter]

23:20.273 --> 23:25.195
I was notorious for going into the bars
and letting somebody pick a fight with me.

23:25.821 --> 23:28.990
I was kind of entertainment
for horse people.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.284
One time at the Lake Placid Horse Show,

23:31.368 --> 23:35.705
I was in a bar, the bouncer had
knocked out one of my friends.

23:35.789 --> 23:38.500
-I said, "You motherfucker, I'll fix you."
-[bar chatter]

23:38.583 --> 23:42.003
I pulled out a billy club and I went
to hit him and he took it away from me.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.297
I go back to my car and I grab a pistol.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.258
[tense music plays]

23:46.341 --> 23:48.677
[Tommy] I went to approach him
with the pistol.

23:49.386 --> 23:52.722
Suddenly the police pulled up
and told me to drop the gun.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.935
-Then toted me off to the police station.
-[gate clanks shut]

23:58.061 --> 23:59.312
They'd read my rights

23:59.396 --> 24:03.275
and he told me that I was going to be
charged on assault with a deadly weapon.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.734
[birds chirping]

24:06.194 --> 24:10.323
The next morning, Jim Druck came down
and talked to the sergeant.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.785
Suddenly, the gun charge was dropped.

24:14.369 --> 24:16.621
Whatever he did was magic,

24:16.705 --> 24:22.043
because when I left there just paying
like a $50 fine for an assault.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.920
And that was it. I was released.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.260
[somber music plays]

24:30.343 --> 24:34.931
[Tommy] When we got back to the farm,
I said, "How the hell did you do that?"

24:35.015 --> 24:38.852
He looked at me, he smiled.
He goes, "You owe me."

37:47.598 --> 37:51.686
One guy who owns a bank,
and he's giving me, you know, a check.

37:51.769 --> 37:52.895
[electrical buzzing]

37:53.813 --> 37:55.273
-[register dinging]
-[snorting]

37:55.356 --> 37:58.150
One wealthy woman came up to me
with a big friendly smile

37:58.234 --> 38:00.736
at the horse show and said,
"Could you kill my horse?"

38:00.820 --> 38:04.156
Just like, you know, like you're
gonna cut her grass or something.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.241
[electrical buzzing]

38:05.324 --> 38:07.076
-[register dinging]
-[snorting]

38:07.159 --> 38:09.704
[Tommy] I was beginning to believe
it wasn't against the law.

-[register dinging]

38:12.206 --> 38:13.332
[applause]

38:13.416 --> 38:16.919
[announcer 3] Right now he is faster
than Lisa Jacquin.

38:17.003 --> 38:20.881
[Tommy] And then I was asked to kill
George Lindemann, Jr.'s horse, Charisma.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.718
And I was really like, "What?"

38:23.801 --> 38:26.220
[announcer 4] Easy in. Easy over B.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.680
[cheers and applause]

38:27.763 --> 38:30.766
[Tommy] This was the elite elite.
One of the most well-known,

38:30.850 --> 38:33.227
one of the wealthiest families
in the horse industry.

38:33.311 --> 38:36.480
The government projected
they were worth a billion dollars.

38:36.564 --> 38:39.400
The horse was insured for 250,000.

38:39.483 --> 38:42.028
And I would get 35, plus expenses.

38:42.111 --> 38:44.363
[announcer 4]
Gallop at the water jump and over.

38:44.947 --> 38:46.490
Marvelous performance!

38:46.574 --> 38:51.537
If I couldn't ride tomorrow, I'll always
have a place in the show jumping books

38:51.620 --> 38:54.749
for having won this class.
It's the most exciting class of the year.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.250
-[buzzing]
-[register dinging]

38:56.834 --> 38:59.003
[Ordine] The question was
why would really rich people

38:59.086 --> 39:01.630
who have more money
than any of us could ever imagine

39:01.714 --> 39:05.176
or ever spend in our lifetimes,
why would these people kill a horse?

39:05.259 --> 39:06.260
[crowd murmurs]

39:06.344 --> 39:08.220
[Cox] To George Lindemann, Jr.,

39:08.304 --> 39:11.057
Charisma was
a tremendous disappointment.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.851
The horse was bought for a lot of money,

39:13.934 --> 39:16.103
top of the market,
quarter of a million dollars.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.148
It was inconsistent in performance.

39:19.774 --> 39:20.608
[crowd groans]

39:20.733 --> 39:23.569
[Cox] And it became a symbol
of sort of failure.

39:23.652 --> 39:27.907
And so, if the horse goes away,
you collect your insurance money.

39:27.990 --> 39:30.785
It's done, and you're past it
and you go on to something else.

39:30.868 --> 39:35.498
You can have the horse eliminated,
you can have this embarrassment removed,

39:35.581 --> 39:38.542
and at the same time
make yourself financially whole.

39:39.126 --> 39:43.631
[somber music playing]

39:47.885 --> 39:49.887
[Cullen] Tommy Burns, the Sandman.

39:52.264 --> 39:53.974
He puts the horses to sleep.

-[hay rustling]

40:01.399 --> 40:05.277
[Cullen] What Tommy didn't know
was that by January of 1991,

40:06.195 --> 40:08.322
authorities had put him
under surveillance.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.950
[suspenseful music plays]

40:11.033 --> 40:12.493
[cell phone ringing]

40:12.993 --> 40:15.830
[Tommy] In 1991,
a friend of mine put me in touch

40:15.913 --> 40:18.290
with another millionaire
that had money, Donna Brown.

40:19.333 --> 40:22.336
She was the owner
of a horse named Streetwise.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.796
She didn't like the motherfucker.

40:24.547 --> 40:27.174
And she was like,
"Well, how are you going to do it?"

40:27.258 --> 40:29.802
Because this horse
has had a colic operation before

40:29.885 --> 40:32.388
and the insurance company
is not gonna cover the colic.

40:32.471 --> 40:34.723
She said,
"Why don't you break its fucking leg?"

40:35.891 --> 40:38.686
[Tommy] In my mind,
electrocution was painless.

40:38.769 --> 40:40.229
This was something different.

40:41.564 --> 40:45.734
She was really absolutely
a fucking bitch about it.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.778
You know, I thought I was heartless.

40:48.362 --> 40:50.072
I said I'd think about it.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.617
[tense music plays]

40:53.701 --> 40:56.370
[Arlie] I was working
as a groom in Chicago,

40:56.454 --> 40:58.789
and at the time, Tommy had came around.

40:58.873 --> 40:59.748
Um--

41:00.458 --> 41:03.461
And I was--
You know, I saw him, but didn't know him.

41:04.336 --> 41:07.089
And I'd inquired about him.
I was like, "Who is that?"

41:07.173 --> 41:08.966
"That's Tommy Burns."

41:10.092 --> 41:13.262
I said, "Tommy Burns?"
He said, "That's, you know, Sandman."

41:15.556 --> 41:18.392
[Arlie] My next encounter with him,
I said, "I heard about you."

41:18.476 --> 41:22.062
He said, "What you heard about me?"
I said, I heard, "You are not nice."

41:24.148 --> 41:27.234
At that time, my drug problem
was getting out of hand.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.903
And that addiction costs.

41:29.612 --> 41:33.324
I told him, "If you ever need some help,
let me know. I'm a hustler too."

41:33.407 --> 41:36.410
He mentioned to me about
would I be interested in going to Florida.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.870
I was like, "Sounds good."

41:37.953 --> 41:40.706
He said, "Look, we're gonna bring
this horse down there."

41:40.789 --> 41:43.834
"Horse gotta have an accident."
I'm like, "What you mean?"

41:44.335 --> 41:48.464
He said, "You know, we gotta make it look
like he broke his leg in the trailer."

41:48.547 --> 41:51.717
So I told him, "Look, I want a half
of whatever you're getting."

41:51.800 --> 41:56.347
Yeah, I told him that. Yeah.
I mean, if we're gonna do it, let's do it.

41:56.430 --> 41:58.015
[insects chirp]

41:58.098 --> 42:02.603
[dramatic music plays]

42:04.355 --> 42:05.689
[Arlie] Sixty, 70 degrees,

42:05.773 --> 42:08.692
a nice summer night with a breeze,
wasn't too hot.

42:09.818 --> 42:11.612
And, uh, man…

42:12.738 --> 42:14.657
We deciding on who's gonna do it.

42:15.241 --> 42:18.369
[grim music plays]

42:18.452 --> 42:20.955
[Arlie] He told me, he said,
"Well, you gonna do it?"

42:21.038 --> 42:24.416
"Do it? Do what?" I said,
"Man, I ain't never done this before."

42:24.500 --> 42:26.919
-[horse snorts]
-He said, "You're stronger than me."

42:27.002 --> 42:29.380

42:30.673 --> 42:31.966
I'm like, "Oh, man."

42:33.968 --> 42:34.885
I had some drinks.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.017
I said, "Just hold it."

42:42.601 --> 42:43.644
"Just hold the horse."

42:43.727 --> 42:45.854
[horse neighing]

42:45.938 --> 42:48.190
That horse knew
something was about to happen.

42:49.316 --> 42:50.943
[horse snorts]

42:53.821 --> 42:55.573
And all I remember is just…

42:57.157 --> 42:57.992
one swing.

42:58.909 --> 42:59.785
Bow!

43:02.329 --> 43:04.164
You heard the crack, loud crack.

43:04.248 --> 43:06.417
I'll never forget
that sound long as I live.

43:07.835 --> 43:09.878
Awful, man. [sighs]

43:13.173 --> 43:14.425
We drew a lot of attention.

43:14.508 --> 43:16.635
People coming out,
I don't know where from.

43:16.719 --> 43:20.347
The doctor was there
pretty daggone fast, I must say.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.601
[sighs] So they injected him,
put him to sleep.

43:23.684 --> 43:25.394
We jumped in the truck and trailer.

43:25.477 --> 43:28.105
It had to have been midnight
with a full moon.

43:30.065 --> 43:33.152
Harlow was pretty quiet and feeling
pretty miserable what happened.

43:34.653 --> 43:37.323
The kind of person I am, that wasn't me.

43:38.991 --> 43:39.867
[quavers] And, uh…

43:39.950 --> 43:40.993
[Arlie sighs]

43:41.493 --> 43:43.037
I feel more like a coward.

43:43.662 --> 43:46.832
You know, to hurt an innocent animal.
You know what I mean?

43:48.500 --> 43:50.377
For $5,000.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.463
[tense music plays]

43:52.546 --> 43:54.882
[Tommy] We got about two miles
down the road

43:54.965 --> 43:57.176
and suddenly police cars came at us.

43:57.259 --> 43:58.260
[sirens wail]

43:58.344 --> 44:02.473
They brought us to a stop.
All you heard was guns cranking up.

44:02.556 --> 44:03.849
[guns cocking]

44:03.932 --> 44:08.687
I jumped out of the truck and ran.
I knew I was in a shit pile of trouble.

44:08.771 --> 44:10.648
[indistinct police radio chatter]

44:10.731 --> 44:12.608
[suspenseful music plays]

44:13.192 --> 44:15.903
A state policeman
cocked a shotgun to my head.

44:15.986 --> 44:17.988
"Tommy Burns, you're under arrest."

44:18.072 --> 44:19.531
[gate clanks shut]

44:30.709 --> 44:32.920
[Cullen] That's when we finished
Tommy's interview.

44:35.839 --> 44:39.468
I just remember looking at
20-some-odd pages of handwritten notes.

44:39.551 --> 44:41.553
[somber music plays]

44:41.637 --> 44:44.223
[Cullen] I felt that there was
a connection missing.

44:44.973 --> 44:47.601
So the first thing was to make sure that

44:47.685 --> 44:51.271
the information which Tommy
had shared with us was true and correct.

44:53.107 --> 44:56.318
I'd submitted requests
to the National Insurance Crime Bureau,

44:56.402 --> 45:00.614
primarily for the insurance records
and documentation

45:00.698 --> 45:02.741
Henry the Hawk, Rub the Lamp,

45:02.825 --> 45:07.746
Belgium Waffle, Rainman,
Rousseau Platiere, Charisma, Streetwise.

45:08.872 --> 45:10.541
And in all of these cases,

45:10.624 --> 45:13.252
the cause of death on these horses
were all colic.

45:14.128 --> 45:15.087
[Cullen] Colic.

45:15.587 --> 45:16.422
Colic.

45:17.089 --> 45:18.173
Colic.

45:18.257 --> 45:20.801
And that was consistent
with what he was telling us.

45:20.884 --> 45:23.137
[grim music plays]

45:23.220 --> 45:26.807
[Cullen] But something about it
didn't make sense.

45:26.890 --> 45:30.352
Some of the biggest names
in the industry were approaching him.

45:30.436 --> 45:34.606
It just didn't connect how Tommy was able
to get together with these people

45:34.690 --> 45:38.318
without some middleman involved.
He couldn't have acted alone on this.

45:38.819 --> 45:40.237
[insects chirping]

45:40.320 --> 45:41.989
[tense music plays]

45:42.072 --> 45:44.450
[Cullen] What I decided to do
at that point

45:44.533 --> 45:47.286
was to talk to trainers, riders.

45:51.623 --> 45:53.667
So I contacted Paul Valliere.

45:54.168 --> 45:57.713
One of the most famous trainers
in the United States.

45:58.505 --> 46:03.427
Tommy killed a horse for Paul
named Rousseau Platiere.

46:05.888 --> 46:09.725
We met with Paul Valliere,
explained the evidence we had.

46:10.434 --> 46:13.145
We knew that Paul
was guilty of this crime.

46:13.896 --> 46:16.982
He readily admitted it
because he was not a hardened criminal,

46:17.065 --> 46:20.694
and he told us why
he actually set up the fraud.

46:20.778 --> 46:22.613
[music builds]

46:22.696 --> 46:27.659
[Cullen] He owed money to a trainer
on another transaction.

46:28.577 --> 46:34.249
Paul told us that this trainer suggested
that he contact Tommy Burns,

46:34.333 --> 46:37.669
and that Tommy could have the horse killed

46:37.753 --> 46:40.464
and then Paul could obtain
the insurance proceeds.

46:40.547 --> 46:43.133
[eerie music plays]

46:43.217 --> 46:45.844
[Cullen] We asked him,
"Who was this trainer?"

46:46.345 --> 46:47.346
Paul said,

46:48.305 --> 46:49.306
"Barney Ward."

46:49.389 --> 46:51.225
[ominous string music plays]

46:51.308 --> 46:52.392
[Barney laughs]

46:52.476 --> 46:54.102
[Cullen] Barney was that middleman.

46:55.979 --> 46:58.524
He facilitated these horse killings.

47:00.067 --> 47:03.904
If there was a specific horse
that an owner was having trouble with,

47:03.987 --> 47:08.367
Barney Ward would contact Tommy
and said, "I've got one for you to drop."

47:08.450 --> 47:10.869
-[electrical buzzing]
-[music crescendos]

47:16.875 --> 47:19.545
[Tommy] Every time the feds
asked me about the killings,

47:19.628 --> 47:22.548
I always made a point
of leaving Barney's name out of it.

47:23.215 --> 47:28.136
I wouldn't implicate him on anything.
I would've done time for Barney.

47:29.346 --> 47:30.764
[Cullen] We had a real dilemma.

47:31.265 --> 47:34.768
We knew that Barney was the key ringleader
of this fraud scheme.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.812
However, Tommy would not name him.

47:37.980 --> 47:42.109
So we decided to put a recording device
on Paul's home phone

47:42.192 --> 47:45.028
to record conversations
between Paul and Barney.

47:46.822 --> 47:50.325
[Cullen] When I had the recording
and heard the tape, I was shocked.

47:51.326 --> 47:53.954
At that point
we decided to play it for Tommy.

47:54.454 --> 47:58.458
[grim music playing]

47:59.585 --> 48:02.379
[Tommy] And there was
Barney's voice on a tape

48:03.422 --> 48:05.924
telling Paul that
I would never make the stand.

48:07.676 --> 48:08.510
And that…

48:09.678 --> 48:12.264
he arranged to have me killed.

48:14.808 --> 48:17.561
And, uh, it broke my heart.

48:18.061 --> 48:20.272
It absolutely--

48:20.355 --> 48:21.189
Oh…

48:23.191 --> 48:24.401
[sniffles]

48:31.116 --> 48:33.994
[Tommy] I was always led to believe that

48:34.077 --> 48:37.080
this was about--
Barney always told me, it's about us.

48:37.164 --> 48:39.791
"Don't worry about these other people,
the horse people."

48:39.875 --> 48:42.836
"They're just tokens of making money,
but there's always us."

48:43.337 --> 48:47.758
And I think that that was the first time
I realized there wasn't us anymore.

48:47.841 --> 48:49.259
[somber music plays]

48:49.343 --> 48:50.844
[Tommy] I said, you know what?

48:51.720 --> 48:54.181
I'm not going to jail
for any of these people,

48:55.140 --> 48:56.266
especially Barney.

48:58.810 --> 49:02.022
[Cullen] Tommy towards the end
I think became very transparent.

49:02.606 --> 49:04.942
Just a little more endearing.

49:05.025 --> 49:10.030
You could just tell
he was starting to slowly move over

49:11.156 --> 49:14.409
from the dark side to the light side.
He was starting to understand that

49:14.493 --> 49:18.205
he's gonna have to leave this old life
behind and start something new.

49:18.288 --> 49:20.499
-[dramatic music plays]
-[cheering]

49:22.376 --> 49:25.212
[reporter 3] From outside,
the show-jumping world seems as regal

49:25.295 --> 49:27.089
and relaxed as ever.

49:27.172 --> 49:30.217
But the sport has been reeling
since reports that a hitman

49:30.300 --> 49:33.887
had been killing horses so owners
could collect insurance money.

49:34.554 --> 49:38.350
I remember somebody just telling me,
did you hear what happened?

49:38.433 --> 49:41.478
It was, I think,
the dirty little secret of the industry,

49:41.561 --> 49:43.271
and it's now come out of the closet.

49:43.355 --> 49:44.898
[Burke] I was shocked

49:44.982 --> 49:49.736
that somebody would actually
even have the idea to do that

49:50.737 --> 49:52.948
and to actually pull it off.

49:53.031 --> 49:55.492
[reporter 4]
How many horses you think you killed?

49:55.575 --> 49:59.162
Somewhere between 15 and 20.
I didn't count, to tell you the truth.

49:59.246 --> 50:01.665
[Ordine] The federal indictment
lands on my desk

50:01.748 --> 50:06.169
with names attached of people
doing just horrendous things

50:06.253 --> 50:09.589
to their horses,
and they were famous names.

50:10.257 --> 50:13.010
[reporter 5] The prime target
of the federal probe, sources say,

50:13.093 --> 50:14.594
is George Lindemann Jr.,

50:14.678 --> 50:18.932
a champion rider whose family made
millions in the cellular phone business.

50:19.766 --> 50:23.895
[reporter 6] It's expected the grand jury
will rely on the testimony of Tommy Burns,

50:23.979 --> 50:27.607
a self-confessed horse killer,
whose prison sentence has been postponed

50:27.691 --> 50:29.776
while he helps federal investigators.

50:29.860 --> 50:33.321
[Tommy] Nobody, including myself,
needed to do this, nor needed the money.

50:33.405 --> 50:35.407
It boiled down to greed and cheapness,

50:35.490 --> 50:39.036
but I'd have to say on the owners' behalf
a lot more cheapness than anything.

50:39.995 --> 50:43.999
At the trial, they beat up on me
and slammed on me all they wanted,

50:44.082 --> 50:46.293
called me all kinds of names
and everything else.

50:46.376 --> 50:49.504
I kept telling them, "These people
hired me because I was a bad guy."

50:49.588 --> 50:53.508
They didn't hire me because I was
a good guy. So take your best shot,

50:53.592 --> 50:56.678
throw all your bullshit at me,
and call me everything you want.

50:56.762 --> 50:58.889
And you know what?
You're right, most of it.

50:59.473 --> 51:03.101
I am pleased to announce
the charges have been returned

51:03.185 --> 51:05.687
against 19 additional people.

51:05.771 --> 51:09.274
Eighteen of them were charged
with revolting fraud schemes

51:09.357 --> 51:13.570
involving the killing of horses
for the insurance proceeds.

51:14.196 --> 51:15.238
Among those charged

51:15.322 --> 51:19.409
are a virtual who's who
of the nation's equestrian industry,

51:19.493 --> 51:20.744
such as Barney Ward,

51:22.120 --> 51:23.371
George Lindemann Jr.,

51:24.081 --> 51:25.582
Paul Valliere.

51:25.665 --> 51:29.544
Today's wide-ranging charges
should serve as a wake-up call

51:29.628 --> 51:32.631
to the equestrian industry
to get its house in order.

51:32.714 --> 51:33.715
[gavel banging]

51:33.799 --> 51:37.803
[dramatic music playing]

51:44.810 --> 51:47.854
[Arlie] When I was locked up
doing time for this crime,

51:47.938 --> 51:49.356
I fell out the bed one morning

51:49.439 --> 51:52.400
and I fell on the same leg
that I hurt for that horse.

51:53.276 --> 51:56.696
And I've been suffering.
These bad boys, they every hurt every day.

51:57.948 --> 52:00.408
They say,
"You're gonna pay for what you do."

52:01.535 --> 52:02.369
Trust me.
