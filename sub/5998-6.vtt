WEBVTT

00:02.136 --> 00:03.836
.

00:03.837 --> 00:05.537
- First fire, huh?

00:05.539 --> 00:07.506
- In my opinion,
you are not fit for duty.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.308
and I'd advise you
take additional leave.

00:09.310 --> 00:12.044
- Respectfully,
I decline your advice.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.480
- We'll let Severide stay
right where he is.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.749
- No way. I did my job.
Ask Patterson.

00:16.751 --> 00:18.317
- I'm happy to discuss this
with you later.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.403
- I'm not talking to you.

00:20.404 --> 00:22.488
<i> - Your people backtalk</i>
<i> their superior officers.</i>

00:22.490 --> 00:24.757
I know exactly where
they learn that behavior.

00:24.759 --> 00:26.458
- I'll be damned
if Chief Riddle

00:26.460 --> 00:28.560
is gonna change my way
of running this house.

00:28.562 --> 00:32.131
He wants to fight,
then let's fight.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.440
- What is this?

00:41.442 --> 00:43.542
- Patterson.

00:45.613 --> 00:48.580
- Let me guess.
More drilling?

00:48.582 --> 00:50.349
- Yeah.
He called ahead.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.551
Said to start without him.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.686
- And where is
Captain Patterson?

00:54.688 --> 00:57.489
- You ever do any cycling?
- No, Chief.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.458
I can't say I've done much.

00:59.460 --> 01:03.328
- Until drugs corrupted the hell
out of it, it was a great sport.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.430
You want to know why?

01:04.432 --> 01:05.697
It's one of the few sports

01:05.699 --> 01:09.101
that focuses on a team
of individuals.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.170
You see, the cyclist
needs the rest of his team

01:11.172 --> 01:13.605
to get out in front,
provide a wake,

01:13.607 --> 01:15.441
so he can draft on them.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.476
- I'm not sure I follow.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.478
- You want squad three to be
the best squad in the city,

01:19.480 --> 01:20.712
right?
- I do.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.514
- And you have an idea,
a vision,

01:22.516 --> 01:24.383
on how to make that happen,
I assume?

01:24.385 --> 01:26.085
Of course you do.

01:26.087 --> 01:30.489
Well, I have a vision as well,
for the entire CFD,

01:30.491 --> 01:33.692
and it hinges
on this simple concept.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.761
A team of individuals.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.629
We each have a job to do.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.532
We each have to do that job
correctly and professionally

01:40.534 --> 01:42.634
every time,
or the team fails.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.337
It's not that hard a concept
to follow.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.738
- No.

01:46.740 --> 01:51.710
- Boden, Severide,
Dawson, Casey.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.213
The people at 51 are
not team players.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.481
Plain and simple.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.216
And you've seen that.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.251
- Chief Boden has a unique way
of doing things--

01:59.253 --> 02:01.753
- Exactly.
I couldn't agree with you more.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.623
So, when I make a move

02:04.625 --> 02:08.794
to change the way
he's doing things,

02:08.796 --> 02:10.896
I want to make sure
that you're ready to step up.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.632
Are you?

02:13.634 --> 02:15.801
- Yes, Chief, I am.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.370
- That's exactly
what I wanted to hear.

02:18.372 --> 02:22.641
- <i> Truck 81, Squad 3,</i>
<i>Ambulance 61, structure fire.</i>

02:22.643 --> 02:25.811
- Dismissed.
- <i> 5057 East, 21st place.</i>

[sirens blaring]

Gotta save her!
Please.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.897
[woman screaming]

02:44.899 --> 02:47.566
- Help!
Please!

02:47.568 --> 02:49.868
Help!
[baby crying]

02:49.870 --> 02:51.403
- Casey, need a ladder.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.539
- Mouch, Otis,
let's get the aerial up there.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.374
- Severide, climb up
to that woman.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.242
- On it.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.344
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

02:59.346 --> 03:02.314
- Get us down, please!

03:02.316 --> 03:04.650

[coughs]

03:04.652 --> 03:07.352
I heard this electrical shock,
and then--

03:07.354 --> 03:09.254
[coughs]
- What's your name?

03:09.256 --> 03:10.422
- Bob.
- Bob?

03:10.424 --> 03:13.959
- I'm Bob.
- Help! Up here!

03:13.961 --> 03:15.394
- Summoned to headquarters.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.595
What do we got?

03:16.597 --> 03:18.964
- 51, get a line in the house.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.767
<i> - Copy that, Chief.</i>

03:21.769 --> 03:23.368
- There's no one else inside?

03:23.370 --> 03:24.870
- Not that I know of.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.605
- Squad, let's get in
and do a primary search.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.274
Cruz, come with me.
Cap, Tony, take the back door.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.476
- Copy that!

03:31.478 --> 03:32.778
- Help!
Help us!

03:32.780 --> 03:34.479
- Come on.
They're gonna get 'em.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.248
They'll be fine.
- Oh, my God!

03:36.250 --> 03:38.650

03:38.652 --> 03:41.620
- Hurry!
It's really hot up here!

03:41.622 --> 03:43.322
- Hold on!
We're coming!

03:43.324 --> 03:46.325

03:46.327 --> 03:47.326
Aah!

03:47.328 --> 03:48.327
Please hurry!

03:48.329 --> 03:49.628
- Get that ladder up!

03:49.630 --> 03:51.530
- It's too hot!
[baby crying]

03:51.532 --> 03:52.898
- Stay right where you are!

03:52.900 --> 03:54.299
Don't move!

03:54.301 --> 03:56.735
[baby crying]
- I'm gonna throw him to you.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.238
- No!
Hey, hey, don't do that.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.873
- I have to!

04:01.875 --> 04:04.776
- No!
Wait!

04:16.457 --> 04:17.623
- [sobbing]

04:17.625 --> 04:20.826
- I got him!

04:20.828 --> 04:22.561

04:22.563 --> 04:23.562
- He's okay!

04:23.564 --> 04:25.597
The baby's okay!

04:25.599 --> 04:27.599
- [sobbing]

04:27.601 --> 04:29.801
[baby crying]

04:29.803 --> 04:32.904
- Severide, go!
- It's too hot!

04:32.906 --> 04:35.374
I can't take it.
I got to jump!

04:35.376 --> 04:36.742
- Severide!

04:36.744 --> 04:38.644
- Oh!

04:38.646 --> 04:41.513
- I got you.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.616
- [heavy breathing]

04:47.821 --> 04:50.922
- I got you.
- I'm okay.

04:51.859 --> 04:54.660
[indistinct shouting]

04:54.662 --> 04:57.729
- Okay, watch.
- [breathing heavily]

04:59.767 --> 05:04.670
Oh, oh.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.672
I didn't--
I didn't know what I--

05:06.674 --> 05:08.974
- He's fine, ma'am.
He's fine.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.375
Come on, ride with us.

05:10.377 --> 05:12.477
Come on.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.648
- You going, too?
- No, I'm driving myself.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.717
- Okay, ready?

05:22.323 --> 05:23.622
- That was incredible.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.624
- That your family?
[siren wails]

05:25.626 --> 05:27.459
- Yeah, that's my sister
and my nephew.

05:27.461 --> 05:32.664
I just--I just happened
to be in town.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.634
I yelled when I woke up.
I don't know.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.602
Maybe it helped.
I don't know.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.771
- Is that from "Signals?"

05:39.773 --> 05:42.808
- [chuckles]
Yeah.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.376
- I'm a huge Rush fan.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.711
- Well, that's cool.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.479
That's why I'm here.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.981
You know, I work for the band.
- Really?

05:49.983 --> 05:53.919
- Yeah. Yeah, we're here
to do one last show.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.387
- In Chicago?
- Mm-hmm.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.373
- I didn't hear.
- No, I know.

05:57.374 --> 05:59.358
They announced Friday and it
sold out in, like, 30 minutes.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.592
- Oh, you got
to be kidding me.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.993
I thought Los Angeles.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.829
- Yeah, I know, we all did.
Right?

06:03.831 --> 06:06.865
But with these guys, you got
to expect the unexpected.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.467
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, hey,

06:08.469 --> 06:10.369
how do I get to the hospital
from here?

06:10.371 --> 06:12.604
- Oh, of course.
Uh, Chicago Med.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.639
What you're gonna want to do
is head down to Cermak.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.475
Hang a left.
Go about four blocks.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.810
You'll see St. Louis Avenue.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.545
- My birthday's next month.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.947
- Congratulations?
- I'm just saying,

06:21.949 --> 06:24.149
if someone wants to spring
for Rush tickets for me.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.585
- Oh, how much?
- 800 on Tix-a-lot.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.687
- I'll just get you a cake.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.029
- What was that?
- What?

06:38.031 --> 06:40.031
- I saw that.
Spill, sister.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.167
- It's nothing.
Something.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.402
- I want in.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.070
- Chili and Jimmy.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.038
- Shut up.
- No way.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.674
- Okay, guys,
we barely kissed.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.643
For an hour.
- I freaking knew it.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.412
- How was it?
- [chuckles]

06:53.414 --> 06:54.813
An eleven.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.014
- Wallace...
- Yeah?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.983
- Chief Riddle's office
called.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.951
They want hard copies
of all your incident reports.

06:59.953 --> 07:00.986
- For the whole month?

07:00.988 --> 07:03.688
- The whole year.

07:03.690 --> 07:07.859
Don't shoot the Connie.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.562
- Casey, I'm gonna have to swing
home pick up some reports

07:10.564 --> 07:12.164
I've been working on.
Um, can you?

07:12.166 --> 07:14.132
- You're covered.
- Thank you.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.902
- You ever, uh,
had an in-house flame?

07:16.904 --> 07:20.572
- No. I mean, maybe, like,
a match flare once, but no.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.807
- Okay, my two cents.

07:21.809 --> 07:22.908
I advise against it.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.977
Nothing good
can come from this.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.212
Except once, one.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.880
That was Dawson and Casey.

07:28.882 --> 07:32.584
- Thank you,
and hey, I say you go for it.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.286
- I don't know.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.987
- I heard some things
about Riddle at the union meet.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.123
- Yeah, that jag-off's been out
to get us for a while.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.092
- Well, Monahan at 36
says he is gunning for us, like,

07:41.094 --> 07:42.494
both barrels.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.563
Thinks Firehouse 51's
a stumbling block

07:44.565 --> 07:46.515
to him getting commissioner.

07:46.516 --> 07:48.466
- Nah, this house
has weathered plenty,

07:48.469 --> 07:50.702
and we'll weather this.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.605
Boden can handle anything.

07:53.607 --> 07:54.906
- And let's go.
[stopwatch beeps]

07:54.908 --> 07:57.242

- So call it in.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.784

Second floor.
Bringing him out now.

Let's go again.

08:32.579 --> 08:34.679
Come on, again.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.151
- Paperwork. It's what
he wants to hang me on.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.653
Incident reports, please.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.188
- He can't fire you
if you didn't do anything wrong.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.689
- He can transfer me.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.724
He's just waiting
for an excuse

08:45.726 --> 08:46.892
to fill in at the bottom
of the form.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.226
I guarantee you.
Bye, bye 51.

I'm Serena.
I'm airbnbing next door.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.585
but, um, welcome.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.220
- Just means that I'm here
for a few weeks.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.822
I wanted to let you know in case
my music was too loud,

09:17.824 --> 09:19.691
or whatever.
It's not.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.927
I mean, it won't be,
but here's my number

09:21.929 --> 09:23.662

to get a hold of me.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.829

09:24.831 --> 09:26.231
- Welcome to
the neighborhood.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.701
I'm Donna,

09:29.703 --> 09:32.070
he's Wallace.
- Yeah, I...

09:32.072 --> 09:33.605
- Let us know

When we're out there,
I'm the one calling the shots.

21:09.435 --> 21:12.470

when everything happens at once,

21:12.472 --> 21:13.638

your gut.

- Yeah,
I'm not talking about that.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.775
I'm talking about a pattern

21:17.776 --> 21:20.777

my authority.

21:20.780 --> 21:25.516
- If you think that, Captain,
then I apologize.

execute it with precision.

You know where Chief is?

23:16.763 --> 23:19.130
- Pulling up now.

23:19.132 --> 23:21.165
- Just what he needs.
- Absolutely.

kick our people out.
