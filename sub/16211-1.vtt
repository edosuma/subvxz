01:35.100 --> 01:36.180
What is this again?

01:36.700 --> 01:38.980
Don't you have other things to do
besides this?

01:39.660 --> 01:41.600
Sorry sir,
this lane is closed temporarily.

01:41.720 --> 01:44.060
You can turn around
through the other way.

01:44.220 --> 01:45.500
Please understand.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.160
Go on.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.100
But I'm gonna be late!

01:50.520 --> 01:51.900
This is a very important order package.

01:52.100 --> 01:53.450
If this package is not
delivered on time...

01:53.900 --> 01:55.280
Who do you think will be responsible?!

01:55.660 --> 02:00.840
Geez, Okay. Just be quick, all right?

02:01.680 --> 02:03.000
You can pass.

02:03.260 --> 02:04.240
Come on.

02:09.259 --> 02:11.440
What a really bad day...

02:13.140 --> 02:15.240
Rough morning. What more...

02:21.160 --> 02:21.900
Dammit!

02:22.160 --> 02:23.100
Dammit!

02:47.260 --> 02:49.200
As if anything else could go worse!

03:38.360 --> 03:43.400
"TRAIN TO BUSAN"

03:44.320 --> 03:45.160
Sunbaenim,

03:45.620 --> 03:49.500
statistical data companies showed
abnormal stock market returns.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.040
What we need is to take action
as soon as possible.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.260
In order to secure our
position in this stock market.

03:56.200 --> 03:56.860
Yes.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.000
Thank you for the instructions.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.360
I will do it as soon as possible.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.260
Yes.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.460
It will be done as you wish.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.180
Yeah yeah.

04:11.220 --> 04:12.160
Have a nice day!

04:29.000 --> 04:30.100
Come into my office.

04:47.560 --> 04:48.480
Yes, director?

04:49.120 --> 04:50.880
Secure all of our assets
in the stock market.

04:51.460 --> 04:52.400
All of them?

04:52.850 --> 04:53.400
Yes.

04:54.050 --> 04:56.160
Is it not too risky to do this?

04:56.560 --> 04:58.350
We could still maintain
our first assets...

04:58.500 --> 05:00.300
and wait if something better comes...

05:00.500 --> 05:01.040
Mr. Kim...

05:01.700 --> 05:02.360
Yes sir?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.400
You just do what I tell you to do.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.680
We must be careful of the
possibilities that may happen.

05:10.900 --> 05:11.480
Yes sir.

05:14.620 --> 05:15.760
One more thing Mr Kim...

05:18.600 --> 05:21.340
What's the popular
gift for kids nowadays?

05:27.220 --> 05:31.300
<i>Forget it. You really can't be a good dad to
Soo-an. You didn't even attend her recital.</i>

05:31.600 --> 05:34.240
You know I'm busy at work.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.340
She can stay here in Seoul with me.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.900
<i>Just send her here in Busan!</i>

05:38.340 --> 05:39.900
<i>You've already broke your promises!</i>

05:41.300 --> 05:44.040
<i>How many times have you told her
you'll come come with her.</i>

05:44.760 --> 05:45.900
<i>Can you keep it just this once?</i>

05:46.180 --> 05:47.900
Yes, I promise we'll go there soon!

05:49.100 --> 05:50.900
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

05:51.060 --> 05:52.740
Take my word for it.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.800
<i>Anyway you have to keep your promise.</i>

05:55.360 --> 05:56.900
<i>Our daughter is tired
of your broken promises.</i>

05:57.180 --> 05:58.200
Nevermind, talk to you later.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.980
<i>You know that its her
birthday tomorrow right?</i>

06:01.500 --> 06:02.440
I know!

06:30.700 --> 06:31.720
Let me help you with that.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.120
Thank you.

06:33.680 --> 06:34.460
How is she?

06:35.860 --> 06:38.740
She's playing in her room.

06:40.620 --> 06:45.060
When are we going there?
Don't know when.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.300
Mom doesn't talk to Dad, huh?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.600
I have to go. Dad is here.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.700
Soo-ann why are you awake?

07:08.940 --> 07:10.300
I can't sleep

07:13.600 --> 07:15.660
Your mom and I talked.

07:17.380 --> 07:20.520
I promised your mom we'd go together.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.240
But before that there are things
I have to do...

07:24.580 --> 07:26.300
Soo-an you have to be patient.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.300
Open it.

07:40.780 --> 07:43.500
You thought I forgot? Happy birthday.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.600
Open it now.

08:04.140 --> 08:06.660
What's wrong... Don't you like it?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.800
Could you replace this one?

08:28.940 --> 08:30.000
Maybe we could?

08:30.480 --> 08:31.900
What do you want?

08:33.659 --> 08:34.640
Busan.

08:35.220 --> 08:37.299
I want to go to mom at Busan.

08:37.980 --> 08:38.700
Tomorrow.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.760
Yeah, just wait.

08:41.220 --> 08:43.159
We'll certainly go there once
your dad is done with work.

08:43.260 --> 08:44.000
No.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.360
Tomorrow.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.100
You always make promises you can't keep.

08:48.180 --> 08:49.800
We have to go tomorrow no matter what.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.320
Are you not tired of working
all the time?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.500
Grant my wish for once.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.700
What did your daughter said?

09:05.500 --> 09:07.000
She wants us to have a vacation.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.000
Does she want to go to Busan?

09:12.640 --> 09:13.520
Yes.

09:14.240 --> 09:19.020
Since the divorce,
she loves you both less.

09:20.540 --> 09:24.200
She misses the times when her parents
were still together.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.260
As if she wants her
family reunited again.

09:27.580 --> 09:30.900
There's nothing wrong with your family
being reunited again.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.540
Try it this time so your family
is back together again.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.380
Ma...

09:36.580 --> 09:37.940
I do not want to talk about it...

09:41.280 --> 09:43.020
Let it be the past...

09:45.440 --> 09:46.240
Okay.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.140
Don't be too busy with work...

09:52.180 --> 09:55.160
Sometimes you should not always
focus on work. Soo-an is growing up.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.280
She also needs you.

09:58.860 --> 10:02.680
Take care of your family,
especially Soo-an.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.900
<i>Come on Soo-an, cheer up!</i>

10:48.000 --> 10:49.900
<i>It's okay, continue singing...</i>

10:50.560 --> 10:53.900
<i>Please give a round of applause
to Soo-an!</i>

11:06.824 --> 11:07.824
<i>Okay.</i>

11:08.280 --> 11:09.300
<i>Yes...ma..</i>

11:10.120 --> 11:10.880
<i>Okay.</i>

11:11.940 --> 11:12.840
No.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.420
I'm with dad.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.600
Yeah, see you there...

11:36.020 --> 11:39.600
Hey Soo-an,
isn't your song finished yet?

11:40.120 --> 11:43.100
How did you know? You weren't there.

11:44.780 --> 11:48.600
Dad always know what you've been doing.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.600
You got nervous right? Am I right?

11:52.320 --> 11:53.260
Yes...

11:54.080 --> 11:54.960
Okay.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.880
You know you have to finish that song.

12:00.340 --> 12:04.140
When you start something.
You should finish it no matter what.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.700
Always remember that.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.980
Ahh... that was close.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.680
What's going on?

12:34.200 --> 12:36.240
It's like raining ashes.

12:37.620 --> 12:39.160
It looks like a big fire.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.700
Hopefully there were no casualties.

13:06.600 --> 13:16.260
<i>All departing passengers, kindly board the train
now as this train is now ready to depart for Busan.</i>

13:16.460 --> 13:17.700
Excuse me, where is the south station?

13:17.720 --> 13:19.440
Ah, South station,
you need to go that way..

13:19.640 --> 13:20.360
Thank you.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.800
Hold on, hold on... Your scarf...

13:58.780 --> 14:01.940
Please rest during this trip.

14:02.020 --> 14:03.240
Good.

14:05.980 --> 14:07.900
Wow, Jin-Hee is here.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.640
What do you mean,
I'm coming with you guys.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.240
I'm your cheerleader.

14:19.500 --> 14:20.500
How are you guys doing?

14:20.540 --> 14:21.660
Good.

14:22.740 --> 14:26.480
Finally, something fresh for the eyes!

14:26.800 --> 14:28.040
Finally!

14:30.700 --> 14:32.960
Hey, it's rude to take something
that's not yours.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.780
You really hate to share.

14:35.080 --> 14:39.140
Hey, maybe if we were lovers
you're gonna share...

14:39.160 --> 14:41.380
I might even share my bed with you...

14:41.580 --> 14:44.460
Wow, very tempting!

14:45.000 --> 14:51.080
Share with her! Share with her!
Share with her! Share with her!

14:55.300 --> 14:56.260
You want some?

14:57.300 --> 14:59.220
Oh my God!

14:59.520 --> 15:02.080
Don't eat too much eggs...
You'll be passing gas later...

15:02.260 --> 15:03.080
Here take it.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.100
- Eat...
- No thanks.

15:06.640 --> 15:10.180
- <i>Sunbaenim, are you on the train?</i>
- Yes, we're on the train.

15:10.740 --> 15:15.400
<i>Stop thinking about work...
We'll take care of it.</i>

15:15.960 --> 15:16.840
Okay.

15:18.340 --> 15:20.340
We will discuss it again
after this holiday.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.640
He manages the company well.

15:22.940 --> 15:25.020
- See you later.
- <i>Good.</i>

16:29.200 --> 16:37.340
- This is not happening...
- This is not happening...

16:38.000 --> 16:39.520
Please don't let this happen!

16:49.800 --> 16:51.300
- Choi Gyo..
- Yes.

16:52.660 --> 16:54.220
- Can you please check lavatory?
- Okay.

16:54.780 --> 16:57.680
- I'd been waiting to go to the lavatory.
- It's occupied.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.220
Ask what's happening in there.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.520
I'm afraid something happened to him.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.700
Yes, he's been there a long time.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.359
Well, I will check...
Please wait a moment...

17:20.000 --> 17:20.819
Sir?

17:23.500 --> 17:24.500
Sir?

17:28.099 --> 17:29.040
Sir?

17:39.780 --> 17:40.620
Sir?

17:42.040 --> 17:42.880
Sir?

17:43.660 --> 17:45.720
Do you have a ticket?

17:48.740 --> 17:51.220
Sir, do you have a ticket?

17:51.320 --> 17:54.500
If you don't, we need to drop
you off on the next station.

17:55.580 --> 17:56.840
Everyone is dead.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.420
- Everyone is dead.
- What?

18:08.320 --> 18:09.500
Hey little girl!

18:10.100 --> 18:12.500
What are you doing here?

18:13.480 --> 18:17.500
I think there are zombies hiding here.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.500
There are no zombies in
modern times like this.

18:21.820 --> 18:23.800
Sir, you must come with me to the back.

19:02.260 --> 19:03.180
Lavatory?

19:04.860 --> 19:07.520
We'll, you'll need to find another place
because my pregnant wife is there.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.820
Go through there... go.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.940
It will really take a while.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.420
Baby? How are you doing in there?

19:20.820 --> 19:23.500
Ahhh... sorry, go ahead.
Take your time... take your time.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.880
Please go ahead.

19:25.060 --> 19:26.480
Go there, go there.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.880
She's gone, she's gone.
Relax... relax...

19:41.200 --> 19:43.440
Miss? Are you okay?

19:43.660 --> 19:45.480
Miss? Oh what to do?

19:47.180 --> 19:49.680
There's an emergency at car 11!

19:50.140 --> 19:50.920
Chief!

20:04.920 --> 20:06.460
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Yes, Kim?

20:06.480 --> 20:08.960
<i>It's more serious than we anticipated.</i>

20:09.200 --> 20:11.200
<i>It's not just an
overnight Ansan incident.</i>

20:11.620 --> 20:15.960
<i>I don't know whats happening,
but it's not a simple strike.</i>

20:16.040 --> 20:18.220
MILITARY DEPLOYED TO CONTROL RIOTS
- <i>They say it's nationwide.</i>

20:18.340 --> 20:20.860
What about breathing?
- <i>Hello?</i>

20:21.000 --> 20:24.840
<i>But I can't seem to control her seizure!</i>

20:25.260 --> 20:26.780
<i>Sir, what should we do?</i>

20:27.200 --> 20:28.680
I'll call you back.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.220
INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE AT RIOT <i>Oh no,
they'll get hurt.</i>

20:42.500 --> 20:43.880
That's terrible.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.960
These people are crazy!

20:47.200 --> 20:50.060
They should be shot and killed.

20:50.100 --> 20:51.600
You mustn't say that.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.588
Look, look.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.480
What's up with them?

20:58.940 --> 20:59.780
Miss?

21:02.100 --> 21:02.960
What must I do?

21:06.660 --> 21:09.120
Chief? Chief where are you?

21:11.920 --> 21:13.420
I don't believe this...

21:23.600 --> 21:24.540
Chief?

21:40.220 --> 21:42.180
Min Jin? Min Jin?

22:09.720 --> 22:10.600
What is that?

22:13.380 --> 22:14.520
What is happening?!

22:16.700 --> 22:17.600
What is this?

22:32.580 --> 22:35.800
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

22:59.069 --> 23:01.068
Hurry! Everyone Run!

23:01.069 --> 23:02.069
Stand up!

23:05.180 --> 23:09.660
Conductor! We have a situation here!

23:22.860 --> 23:23.760
Run! Run!

23:44.921 --> 23:47.421
- Oh my god!
- What the hell?!

23:58.000 --> 23:59.480
Get away! Just go!

24:06.260 --> 24:09.090
Get out of here! Head for the back!

24:09.190 --> 24:10.540
Get up! Hurry!

24:32.720 --> 24:33.580
Daddy!

25:16.040 --> 25:16.820
Baby?

25:18.440 --> 25:21.160
Sang Hwa! So damn loud!

25:21.220 --> 25:23.210
Sorry, the thing is..

25:23.440 --> 25:24.800
Get off me!

25:36.285 --> 25:37.817
You idiot! Go help her!

25:40.440 --> 25:41.140
Hey!

25:41.220 --> 25:42.760
What's with you?!

25:46.360 --> 25:47.600
Have you gone mad?!

26:02.820 --> 26:03.600
Baby?

26:04.620 --> 26:05.720
Sung-Gyeong!

26:08.420 --> 26:09.800
You can run, right?

26:26.940 --> 26:29.580
<i>MASSIVE VIOLENCE, INCREASING CASUALTIES</i>

26:31.040 --> 26:31.940
Get away!

26:43.100 --> 26:44.780
Get the door! The door!

26:46.160 --> 26:47.160
Shut the door!

26:48.520 --> 26:49.590
Quick!

26:50.840 --> 26:51.800
Shut it!

26:53.380 --> 26:54.560
Shut it now!

26:56.400 --> 26:57.900
Just shut it!

27:05.470 --> 27:06.760
I know him!

27:19.760 --> 27:21.280
Where's the lock?

27:22.380 --> 27:24.260
Buddy! How do I lock this?

27:26.560 --> 27:27.920
Do you hear me?!

27:31.880 --> 27:32.960
Let it go.

27:34.040 --> 27:34.920
What?

27:37.980 --> 27:40.180
I don't think they know how to open it.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.120
They attack because they see us.

28:13.520 --> 28:14.650
What in the...

28:14.940 --> 28:16.140
What are they?

28:20.460 --> 28:21.560
Soo-an, you okay?

28:23.535 --> 28:24.535
Hey buddy.

28:25.860 --> 28:26.720
What is it?

28:28.660 --> 28:30.460
Don't you owe me an apology?

28:30.800 --> 28:31.810
What do you mean?

28:32.440 --> 28:33.620
Look at this chump.

28:34.410 --> 28:37.340
You shut the door in our faces, asshole!

28:37.440 --> 28:39.720
You weren't the only ones in danger!

28:41.320 --> 28:42.860
What a piece of work.

28:43.940 --> 28:44.820
Come here.

28:44.860 --> 28:46.520
I'll feed you to them.

28:46.674 --> 28:47.674
Stop it!

28:48.060 --> 28:49.640
Everyone's just scared.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.500
<i>Attention please!</i>

28:56.820 --> 29:01.980
<i>Due to our current situation,
we won't be stopping in Cheonan.</i>

29:02.520 --> 29:05.800
<i>For your safety,
please stay in your seats.</i>

29:11.240 --> 29:13.080
Hello? Anyone there?

29:13.750 --> 29:15.440
<i>Yes, go ahead.</i>

29:15.520 --> 29:19.280
Do you even know
what's going on back here?

29:19.520 --> 29:21.460
Why aren't you stopping in Cheonan?

29:21.480 --> 29:22.740
<i>We're aware, sir.</i>

29:22.800 --> 29:25.840
<i>This is an order from
the control center.</i>

29:26.170 --> 29:27.400
<i>Please be seated.</i>

29:27.580 --> 29:32.160
That's nonsense! People are going rabid!

29:32.680 --> 29:34.560
Stop in Cheonan, get it?!

29:36.360 --> 29:37.280
Excuse me.

29:41.340 --> 29:44.240
I'm really sorry,
but could she sit down?

29:44.360 --> 29:45.460
She's pregnant.

29:45.860 --> 29:46.570
Okay.

29:46.880 --> 29:47.830
Sit, sit.

29:47.840 --> 29:48.560
Thank you.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.860
<i>MOTHER</i>

29:52.560 --> 29:53.420
Yes mom?

29:53.567 --> 29:57.067
<i>Are you on your way?</i>

29:58.220 --> 29:59.640
Yes, we're en route.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.700
<i>Where are you? Why is it so loud?</i>

30:02.860 --> 30:06.900
<i>What's happening? Everyone's fighting.</i>

30:07.260 --> 30:10.560
<i>Are you and Soo-an okay?</i>

30:11.080 --> 30:13.240
Why're you breathing like that,
are you hurt?

30:14.900 --> 30:17.440
<i>Seok-Woo, my baby.</i>

30:18.020 --> 30:22.760
<i>Please take care of Soo-an.</i>

30:23.080 --> 30:24.140
Mom, you okay?

30:25.740 --> 30:28.520
<i>My dear Soo-an...</i>

30:31.660 --> 30:37.320
<i>I love her so much,
but she only wants her mom...</i>

30:40.080 --> 30:41.620
<i>That bitch!</i>

30:50.020 --> 30:50.900
Mom?

30:53.700 --> 30:54.440
<i>Dad.</i>

30:56.959 --> 30:57.959
<i>Dad!</i>

31:00.020 --> 31:01.880
Is granny okay?

31:10.420 --> 31:11.820
What the hell?

31:13.620 --> 31:15.140
Soo-an, sit down.

32:00.020 --> 32:01.640
<i>My fellow citizens,</i>

32:02.461 --> 32:08.961
<i>we're currently experiencing
violent riots in all major cities,</i>

32:09.438 --> 32:13.938
<i>resulting in many civilians
and police injuries.</i>

32:14.740 --> 32:19.120
<i>Riots led to shutting
down of various districts,</i>

32:19.390 --> 32:23.980
<i>and the rioters have
forcibly attempted to destroy</i>

32:24.340 --> 32:26.840
<i>and take over government property,</i>

32:28.660 --> 32:32.000
<i>For this reason,
we're entering state of emergency</i>

32:32.870 --> 32:39.040
<i>in order to control current situations.</i>

32:41.560 --> 32:47.580
<i>Thanks to our government's
rapid response,</i>

32:48.240 --> 32:51.620
<i>various outbreaks are being contained.</i>

32:53.178 --> 32:54.242
<i>Fellow citizens,</i>

32:54.880 --> 33:00.540
<i>please refrain from
reacting to baseless rumors,</i>

33:01.120 --> 33:06.580
<i>and stay in the safety of your homes.</i>

33:07.134 --> 33:10.000
We must stay calm and
trust the government,

33:10.340 --> 33:13.500
in order to overcome
such trying obstacle.

33:14.600 --> 33:18.340
<i>We believe that your
safety is not in jeopardy.</i>

33:32.160 --> 33:33.200
<i>ANALYST KIM</i>

33:40.140 --> 33:41.990
Mommy's phone is off.

33:46.096 --> 33:49.096
<i>Those in front, hurry up!</i>

33:49.525 --> 33:51.025
Soo-an, sit over here.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.963
Don't worry, I'll give her a call.

33:56.005 --> 33:57.605
Jong-Gil, come sit down.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.360
You're older, you sit down.

34:00.380 --> 34:01.500
I'm fine, take it.

34:01.660 --> 34:03.020
Baby, let's go over there.

34:07.740 --> 34:10.080
Ma'am, take my seat.

34:10.159 --> 34:13.219
- I'm okay.
- No, please sit.

34:17.179 --> 34:17.960
Child.

34:19.030 --> 34:19.960
Would you like one?

34:22.880 --> 34:23.760
Thank you.

34:24.820 --> 34:26.469
What a great kid.

34:31.329 --> 34:33.730
- We both got seats.
- Keep walking.

34:34.731 --> 34:35.731
<i>That bag...</i>

34:37.460 --> 34:39.719
Soo-an, you didn't have to do that.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.860
- Do what?
- Being good.

34:43.420 --> 34:46.120
At a time like this,
only watch out for yourself.

34:49.413 --> 34:50.413
Answer me.

34:55.620 --> 34:58.800
Granny always had knee aches.

35:00.452 --> 35:01.452
Soo-an...

35:06.840 --> 35:09.700
<i>May I have your attention please.</i>

35:10.300 --> 35:13.900
<i>Our train will conclude
service at Daejeon station.</i>

35:14.620 --> 35:19.930
<i>Military is deployed there,
and will secure our train.</i>

35:20.380 --> 35:24.000
<i>So once we arrive,
please exit the train.</i>

35:24.300 --> 35:25.740
<i>I repeat,</i>

35:26.380 --> 35:28.920
<i>Daejeon station is our last stop.</i>

35:29.280 --> 35:31.400
Which cities can be entered?

35:31.753 --> 35:34.420
Yeosu, Uljin, Busan. What about Daejeon?

35:34.960 --> 35:36.540
Excuse me, I need to use it.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.100
What about Daejeon?

35:38.590 --> 35:39.440
<i>Why not?!</i>

35:41.580 --> 35:43.940
Soo-an, stay put.

35:48.040 --> 35:48.860
Hey, kiddo.

35:49.640 --> 35:50.360
Yes?

35:50.620 --> 35:52.330
Who is he? Your dad?

35:53.320 --> 35:54.040
Yes.

35:54.290 --> 35:55.820
- Real dad?
- Yes.

35:56.770 --> 35:57.980
I wanna know.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.500
What does he do?

36:00.750 --> 36:02.750
He's a fund manager.

36:02.958 --> 36:05.157
- Fund manager?
- Yes.

36:06.043 --> 36:07.643
He's a bloodsucker, a bloodsucker

36:08.700 --> 36:10.580
He leaches off others.

36:10.720 --> 36:13.460
Don't say that in front of his child.

36:13.840 --> 36:14.940
It's okay.

36:15.740 --> 36:18.340
That's what everyone thinks.

36:24.520 --> 36:25.440
Want some?

36:26.880 --> 36:28.300
It's what Sleepy eats.

36:29.876 --> 36:32.275
This is Sleepy. Say hello

36:33.753 --> 36:35.954
Baby's name is Sleepy?

36:36.460 --> 36:37.550
No, the fetus name.

36:37.840 --> 36:40.120
It's like a nickname,

36:40.540 --> 36:44.380
her dad is too lazy to
come up with a name yet.

36:46.520 --> 36:47.460
Touch her belly.

36:48.060 --> 36:48.890
Right here.

36:50.540 --> 36:51.340
Go on.

36:57.260 --> 36:58.000
Felt it?

36:59.806 --> 37:01.222
I made that.

37:05.340 --> 37:07.500
- You idiot...
- But it's true. No?

37:20.560 --> 37:23.820
<i>Mr. Seok, you called me at a bad time.</i>

37:24.020 --> 37:24.720
Wait, wait!

37:24.920 --> 37:26.780
Let me ask you something.

37:27.040 --> 37:27.840
<i>What?</i>

37:29.280 --> 37:31.180
I'm on KTX to Daejeon.

37:31.220 --> 37:35.150
<i>KTX? Right this minute?</i>

37:35.300 --> 37:36.620
Yes, I'm almost there.

37:37.670 --> 37:40.853
Is it true the military
is deployed in Daejeon?

37:41.840 --> 37:43.290
<i>Yes, that's correct.</i>

37:44.634 --> 37:47.943
Is that so? It must be safe there.

37:49.945 --> 37:52.206
<i>Well... it's...</i>

37:53.840 --> 37:56.920
Min, it is safe, right?

37:57.706 --> 38:02.802
<i>Once you arrive, you'll be quarantined.</i>

38:02.920 --> 38:03.580
What?

38:07.520 --> 38:09.450
I'm with my daughter.

38:10.960 --> 38:14.120
Can you help me and my daughter, huh?

38:16.100 --> 38:16.820
<i>But the thing is...</i>

38:17.020 --> 38:20.670
I'll get you a real scoop,
do me a favor.

38:22.760 --> 38:26.820
<i>Don't go to the main square,
come to the East one, okay?</i>

38:26.900 --> 38:28.540
<i>I'll let my men know.</i>

38:29.630 --> 38:31.800
Okay, thank you. Thanks so much.

38:36.655 --> 38:37.655
All dead...

38:58.000 --> 38:58.880
What's going on?

38:59.740 --> 39:00.600
So quiet...

39:00.786 --> 39:01.786
Is it Daejeon?

39:09.304 --> 39:10.304
<i>There's nobody.</i>

39:11.220 --> 39:12.440
Why isn't anyone here?

39:30.380 --> 39:31.240
Out of my way.

40:22.110 --> 40:23.911
What's going on back there?

40:26.920 --> 40:30.580
This is that violent
incident I told you about!

40:30.620 --> 40:31.440
Conductor!

40:31.680 --> 40:33.480
- You're the conductor?
- Yes.

40:34.300 --> 40:35.800
How many can fit in the engine car?

40:36.100 --> 40:38.260
We must uncouple it and go to Busan.

40:38.300 --> 40:39.400
- Uncouple?
- Yes!

40:39.580 --> 40:41.070
- We can't!
- Why not?!

40:41.270 --> 40:42.760
It can't be done here.

40:44.270 --> 40:46.120
Then where's the military?

40:46.791 --> 40:47.791
Yeah right.

40:48.020 --> 40:50.240
I only received a report about it...

40:50.260 --> 40:51.860
Where's my business card?

40:53.580 --> 40:55.710
I'm the COO of Stallion Express,

40:55.920 --> 40:58.060
all routes into Daejeon are cut off.

40:58.120 --> 40:59.880
Our buses are all rerouted.

41:00.040 --> 41:00.980
But what for?

41:01.060 --> 41:03.440
The city's been quarantined!

41:03.720 --> 41:05.520
They probably won't let us in.

41:05.800 --> 41:10.220
But Busan is still open,
so let's go there!

41:10.240 --> 41:12.620
Wait, if that's true...

41:12.920 --> 41:15.110
- we must take others.
- Take who?!

41:15.140 --> 41:17.220
Let's check the station first.

41:18.020 --> 41:18.720
Hey!

41:45.440 --> 41:48.240
<i>RESTRICTED AREA</i>

42:05.980 --> 42:07.120
Don't mind them.

42:13.640 --> 42:14.640
<i>Come on Soo-an.</i>

42:14.680 --> 42:15.720
Where are we going?

42:17.020 --> 42:18.520
We're going this way.

42:18.640 --> 42:21.450
- Just us?
- Yes, let's go.

42:27.740 --> 42:28.580
What is it?

42:30.350 --> 42:32.340
I'm going this way too.

42:33.117 --> 42:36.001
Main square is that way,
just follow the others.

42:36.100 --> 42:37.760
I'm gonna come with you.

42:38.815 --> 42:40.416
I heard your phone call.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.910
About pulling you two out.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.130
I know others will be quarantined.

42:49.140 --> 42:50.800
It's not true, Soo-an.

42:50.920 --> 42:52.440
I'll go tell the others.

42:52.500 --> 42:56.270
- Soo-an, you don't have to.
- Of course I do!

42:56.367 --> 42:58.635
Forget them! We're all on our own!

43:00.320 --> 43:04.010
Dad, you only care about yourself.

43:06.400 --> 43:09.950
That's why mommy left.

43:29.260 --> 43:30.360
Soo-an...

43:32.360 --> 43:33.160
Hey!

43:33.380 --> 43:35.240

43:35.420 --> 43:36.550

43:38.660 --> 43:40.740
Soo-an, stay right here.

44:01.800 --> 44:02.740
Goddamit!

44:04.720 --> 44:05.620
Hold on!

44:17.400 --> 44:19.230
Go back up! Go! Go!

Mr. Min...

44:37.940 --> 44:39.440
- <i>Mr. Seok!</i>
- I'm in Daejeon.

44:39.640 --> 44:42.200
<i>Is everything okay there?
I can't contact my men!</i>

44:42.220 --> 44:43.260
What?

44:43.660 --> 44:44.580
<i>Hello?!</i>

44:44.720 --> 44:46.020
Help me...

46:10.920 --> 46:12.200
Asshole! Come on!

46:20.846 --> 46:21.846
Faster!

46:24.100 --> 46:25.010
Hold them off!

46:58.840 --> 47:03.080
- Over here! Run!
- This way! Hurry!

47:03.600 --> 47:04.620
Here! Here!

47:08.220 --> 47:09.340

There are still more people!

47:17.949 --> 47:18.949
Hurry up!

47:19.940 --> 47:21.420
Come this way!

47:22.720 --> 47:23.720

47:38.580 --> 47:39.610
Granny!

47:40.451 --> 47:41.451
Please get up!

47:51.940 --> 47:53.190
No, stop!

47:53.820 --> 47:54.800
My sister!

48:03.490 --> 48:04.400
Hop on!

48:24.360 --> 48:25.220
Me too!

48:25.960 --> 48:27.710
Let me in!

48:28.520 --> 48:29.480
Please!

48:47.640 --> 48:50.200
How much longer? We have to leave!

48:50.220 --> 48:52.210
No! my friends aren't here yet!

48:53.460 --> 48:55.380
Those onboard must survive!

48:56.020 --> 48:56.740
Am I right?

49:03.860 --> 49:04.700
Conductor.

49:05.900 --> 49:08.240
Please... depart.

49:29.020 --> 49:30.480
Run! Let's go!

49:46.420 --> 49:47.660
Look, the train!

49:47.940 --> 49:48.800
Run faster!

50:08.295 --> 50:09.762
Snap out of it, idiot!

50:39.220 --> 50:40.100
Watch out!

51:01.570 --> 51:06.260
Control, 101 could not dock
at Daejeon due to the outbreak.

51:06.520 --> 51:09.440
Advise which station is
available to dock, over.

51:09.867 --> 51:14.697
<i>101, due to unstable comm,
it is difficult to advise.</i>

51:15.120 --> 51:20.080
Control, is 101 clear to reach Busan?
Over.

51:22.902 --> 51:26.175
<i>101, we'll clear your route to Busan.</i>

51:26.240 --> 51:27.150
<i>Control center, out.</i>

51:28.680 --> 51:31.260
Advise when you make contact with Busan.

51:32.360 --> 51:33.280
101, out.

52:49.220 --> 52:51.600
<i>Attention everyone.</i>

52:52.061 --> 52:57.137
<i>For those safety of those on board,
we'll head straight for Busan.</i>

52:57.480 --> 52:59.180
We won't be making any stops.

53:00.840 --> 53:02.960
Conductor, can you hear me?

53:03.520 --> 53:04.660
<i>Go ahead.</i>

53:05.240 --> 53:06.840
Were you able to contact Busan?

53:07.180 --> 53:10.010
<i>No, the communication is erratic.</i>

53:11.580 --> 53:13.500
Full speed, no matter what!

53:13.900 --> 53:15.860
Or we won't get in, understand?!

53:23.820 --> 53:25.480
Young-Gook, where are you?!

53:28.140 --> 53:31.060
I thought you were dead!

53:31.520 --> 53:32.560
I'm sorry!

53:35.010 --> 53:36.760
No one else made it!

53:38.120 --> 53:39.180
I'm sorry.

53:50.690 --> 53:52.720
- Baby?
- <i>Mister!</i>

53:53.844 --> 53:56.232
Why are you answering? Where are you?

53:56.432 --> 53:58.820
We're, we're in the train washroom!

53:58.860 --> 54:01.630
Washroom? Which car?

54:01.870 --> 54:04.520
Well... it's...

54:04.560 --> 54:05.860
Car 13!

54:05.940 --> 54:07.740
- Get your ass over here!
- Baby!

54:11.620 --> 54:12.780
Was that my kid?

54:12.900 --> 54:13.840
Is she okay?

54:14.340 --> 54:15.940
Washroom in car 13.

54:31.140 --> 54:32.120
Gonna pass through?

54:34.510 --> 54:36.740
Let's say you got
through and rescue them,

54:36.880 --> 54:38.380
how will you come back?

54:43.080 --> 54:44.350
In car 15,

54:46.020 --> 54:47.600
people are gathered there.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.580
<i>CAR 9</i>

55:12.820 --> 55:14.640
Only 4 cars away.

55:16.739 --> 55:17.739
I'll lead.

55:19.520 --> 55:20.480
You in the middle,

55:22.120 --> 55:23.120
and you in the back.

55:26.620 --> 55:28.580
Block anyone attacking from the rear.

55:40.840 --> 55:42.880
I heard you're a fund manager.

55:45.960 --> 55:47.460
Then you're an expert,

55:48.680 --> 55:50.620
at leaving useless people behind.

55:57.740 --> 55:59.380
Wait till we exit the tunnel.

56:14.400 --> 56:15.510
Let's go.

57:26.820 --> 57:27.520
Come on!

57:30.520 --> 57:31.400
Let's go!

57:48.140 --> 57:48.960
Move.

59:32.880 --> 59:33.980
Out of the way.

59:37.920 --> 59:41.500
They stopped once we entered the tunnel,
right?

59:42.560 --> 59:44.080
Probably because of the darkness.

59:44.120 --> 59:46.060
Yeah, I think so too.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.820
There are even more here.

59:51.960 --> 59:53.250
What do we do now?

59:54.640 --> 59:56.000
There's no way around it.

59:56.880 --> 59:57.800
Let's go.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:04.000
Hey, can I borrow your cell?

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.180
Get that out of my face.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.640
Yo, douche.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.960
Felt good to see your kid thanks to me,
huh?

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.040
Are you grateful or what?

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.800
Why is your ringtone so tacky?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.700
What's wrong with it?

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.780
How do I change it?

01:02:32.422 --> 01:02:36.398
Am I funny? You little rat.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.360
How tall are you?

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:39.760
181cm.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.700
10km away, at 300km/h...

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.580
What?

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:51.040
2 minutes...
upcoming tunnel will give us 2 minutes.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.230
- Can we do it?
- We gotta, we gotta...

01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:59.660
If we miss this one,
there's another in 3km...

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.020
I bet you never get to
play with your daughter.

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:06.600
When she gets older,

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:11.090
she'll understand why you work so hard.

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:16.430
Dads get all the bad rap and no praise,

01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:19.540
but it's all about sacrifice, right?

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:26.200
What's with the look? Did I sound cool?

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.440
<i>People rescued. Heading over now.</i>

01:03:37.951 --> 01:03:39.550
My friend's coming here!

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.180
What did you say?

01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:45.060
My friend from another
car is coming over.

01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:47.580
- Who's coming?
- My friend!

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:51.380
He was in car 9,
and he rescued some people.

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:52.660
Rescued?

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.090
From there to here,
passing through those monsters?

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.480
Without any injuries?

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.700
You sure they're not infected?

01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:08.680
Are you damn sure?!

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.000
What do you mean?

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.770
Look, look at them.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.880
At a moment like this,

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.830
no one knows what
happened to their families.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:27.370
We don't even know if
your damn friends are infected!

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.490
But allow them in here?! Huh?!

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.680
I don't believe this.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.380
Sir,

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.100
please say something.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.720
They'll be here soon.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.360
Sir!

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.720
Get over here.

01:08:56.939 --> 01:08:57.720
One!

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.160
Two!

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:08.760
Run!

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:23.460
Jin-Hee! Jin-Hee!

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:28.300
Hurry the hell up!

01:09:38.399 --> 01:09:39.300
Open up!

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.859
Hey! Open this door!

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:45.240
Jin-hee!

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.380
Open this door!

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.950
- Open up!
- Jin-Hee! Jin-Hee!

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:17.970
Open it now!

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.100
It won't budge!

01:10:20.370 --> 01:10:21.520
I can't open it!

01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:22.649
Smash it!

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.480
Stand back!

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:32.480
Hurry up!

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.360
Dammit!

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:04.220
You stupid idiots!

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:18.890
Come on!

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.540
In-Gil!

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.100
Young-Gook!

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:42.900
Stand back!

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:43.800
Young-Gook!

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:19.740
Stay away!

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:30.680
Stay back, baby. Please go!

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.640
Buddy, hey!

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.160
Take her and leave.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.820
You have to go!

01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:47.920
I said go, douche!

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.840
I'm getting tired, please go.

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:58.640
- Please take...
- ...care of her. I will.

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:03.880
I'll hold them off, just go!

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.120
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:13:26.993 --> 01:13:28.993
We have to go, let's go!

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:32.080
Yoon Su-yun!

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.420
Our baby's name!

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.720
Got it?

01:15:38.939 --> 01:15:40.207
Why did you do it?!

01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:43.980
You bastard!

01:15:45.948 --> 01:15:47.416
We could've save them!

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.960
Why?!

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:53.980
He's infected!

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:57.280
He's one of them!

01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:59.090
This guy's infected!

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.520
His eyes! Look at his eyes!

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:03.940
He'll become one of them!

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.790
Do you all want to die?!

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:07.520
We must throw them out!

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:21.270
Those of you who just arrived,

01:16:22.292 --> 01:16:24.625
I don't think you can stay with us.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:28.480
Please move to the vestibule.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:44.580
Just go!

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:50.700
Get out!

01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:58.720
Get out now!

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:01.540
Hurry up!

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:03.640
Move!

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.480
Go!

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.420
Leave us!

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.000
Get the hell out!

01:17:13.698 --> 01:17:14.698
Out now!

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:17.680
Hurry!

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.200
It'll be safer for you to stay here.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:27.210
No, I don't want to stay.

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:29.961
I'm coming with you.

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:30.700
But...

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:32.530
Get the hell out!

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.920
What are you waiting for!

01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:36.900
Okay, let's go.

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:42.000
Get out! Rest of you!

01:17:42.676 --> 01:17:43.676
Get out!

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:46.020
Get out of here!

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:04.940
Let's go.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.910
Tie it faster!

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.100
More ties! Neckties!

01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:49.020
Shut up! I'm working on it!

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:05.680
Yun In-Gil

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.870
Great name.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:13.320
Always helping others
instead of yourself.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.520
Why did you live like that?

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.480
What was the point?

01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:26.180
So stupid...

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:34.910
Shut up! Be quiet!

01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:37.460
Stay in your seat!

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.940
What a load of shit.

01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:48.000
Finish up and do the other side too.

01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:02.880
Thank you for everyting.

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.520
That woman...

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.960
Stop her!

01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:03.700
Control, this is Busan-bound 101!

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.740
Requesting current situation in Busan,
over.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.370
Control?!

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:09.980
Control!

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.460
It's your birthday...

01:22:43.157 --> 01:22:44.157
Don't worry.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.920
I'll take you to mom no matter what.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.000
Aren't you scared?

01:22:58.940 --> 01:22:59.860
Of course I am.

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.150
I'm scared too.

01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:10.160
I was so scared.

01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:13.840
I thought I'd never see you again.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:21.020
I practiced that song just for you.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.340
That's why I couldn't sing.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.560
Because I didn't see you.

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.360
Will you stay with me?

01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:58.520
<i>EX-WIFE</i>

01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:14.000

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:27.740
<i>ANALYST KIM</i>

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.600
Yes, Kim.

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.300
<i>Have you arrived in Busan?</i>

01:24:35.345 --> 01:24:38.078
Not yet, where are you?
Is it okay there?

01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:42.100
<i>Busan succeeded in initial defense.</i>

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:45.480
What? Are you sure?

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.260
Where did you hear that news, huh?

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:49.160
<i>Boss...</i>

01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:52.500
<i>all of this started at YT BioTech.</i>

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.020
<i>It's our project!
Our plant started all of this!</i>

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.460
<i>Boss...</i>

01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:08.080
<i>please tell me it's not our fault, eh?</i>

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:12.800
<i>We're only doing our jobs, right?</i>

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.980
<i>Is this my fault, huh?</i>

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:20.800
It's...

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.120
It's not your fault.

01:25:27.192 --> 01:25:28.192
<i>Thank you...</i>

01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:31.280
Kim...

01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:18.320
Attention please.

01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:22.470
<i>Due to a blockage on our track,</i>

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:25.200
<i>we have stopped at East Daegu Station.</i>

01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:29.180
<i>We should either wait
for the rescue team,</i>

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:34.060
<i>or we'll have to reach
Busan in another train.</i>

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.700
<i>As soon as I end this announcement,</i>

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.680
<i>I will find a working train
and put it on the left most track.</i>

01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:43.380
What's going on?

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:46.100
<i>I repeat, left most track.</i>

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:50.987
If you're alive, please transfer safely.

01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:54.200
Godspeed.

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:01.880
Will there be a rescue?

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.700
I heard that Busan is safe.

01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:10.620
We have to move now.

01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:56.960
Coast clear?

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:00.950
Yeah.

01:31:04.269 --> 01:31:05.269
You go ahead.

01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:31.540
We've have to find a way across.

01:31:55.490 --> 01:31:56.600
What in the...

01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.200
Over here!

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:48.440
No...

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:49.560
Oh no...

01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:53.380
What now!

01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:56.310
We have to move, come on!

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.060
Jin-Hee, let's go!

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:23.360
Stand back!

01:33:36.671 --> 01:33:37.671

01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:52.940
Jin-Hee!

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.140
This can't be...

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.420
I'm sorry...

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:46.900
<i>Daddy! Wake up!</i>

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:51.470
Daddy! Daddy!

01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:08.330

Please help me. Please... please...

01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:46.800
My mother is waiting for me.

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:56.890
Please bring me home. <i>giving his address</i>

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.940
Please save me.

01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:06.520
You're...

01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:09.340
...already infected.

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:16.460
No.

01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:56.320
Sit here.

01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:01.060
Listen to me...

01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:06.060
Here is the throttle, the brakes.

01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:09.260
When you need to stop, pull the brakes.

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:16.240
Soo-an...

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.500
Look at me... look at me, Soo-an.

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:27.060
Look at me, look at me...

01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:29.100
Soo-an...

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:30.860
listen to me.

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:36.060
You must stay with her, okay?

01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:39.040
Busan is still safe.

01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:42.980
- That is why... that is why...
- Don't go!

01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:46.400
Don't go, father! Come with us.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.060
Please don't leave me...

01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:51.340
Don't go...

01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:54.360

01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:57.840
Don't go...

01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:01.900
You should come with us.

01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:04.340
Don't go...

01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:08.360

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.380
Daddy! Daddy!

01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:34.460
I see something.

01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:45.960
Two subjects are
approaching at our location.

01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:48.120
Looks like a woman and a child.

01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:52.180
<i>Are you able to verify the subjects?
Over.</i>

01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:58.400
It's so dark on the other side.

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:05.060
I can't see them clearly.

01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:09.420
Cant see the subjects clearly.

01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:11.180
Unable to verify.

01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:14.820
<i>Kill them. Over.</i>

01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:06.960
Two survivors approaching!

01:53:41.069 --> 01:53:43.069
