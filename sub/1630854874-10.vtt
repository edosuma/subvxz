WEBVTT

00:30.897 --> 00:32.165
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:32.165 --> 00:33.266
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:33.266 --> 00:34.601
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:34.601 --> 00:35.668
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:35.668 --> 00:36.102
US.

00:36.102 --> 00:37.570
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:37.570 --> 00:38.972
FOX NEWS FOUND ITSELF LOOKING

00:38.972 --> 00:39.472
FOR A NEW HOST OF

00:39.472 --> 00:41.841
"WHITE GRIEVANCE TONIGHT."

00:41.841 --> 00:42.942
MONTANA LAWMAKERS BARRED TRANS

00:42.942 --> 00:44.110
REPRESENTATIVE ZOOEY ZEPHYR FROM

00:44.110 --> 00:45.211
THE HOUSE FLOOR.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.980
AND MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY GAVE A

00:46.980 --> 00:47.881
MOTIVATIONAL SEMINAR TITLED

00:47.881 --> 00:49.349
"THE ART OF LIVIN'."

00:49.349 --> 00:57.023
I CAN'T SHOW YOU ALL OF IT, BUT

00:57.023 --> 00:57.490
HERE IS JUST A TASTE.

00:57.490 --> 00:58.591
IN 1999, I JUST HAD A DREAM

00:58.591 --> 00:59.559
THAT I WAS FLOATING DOWN A

00:59.559 --> 01:00.927
RIVER, NAKED, WRAPPED UP IN

01:00.927 --> 01:03.430
ANACONDAS, SHARKS, PIRANHAS AND

01:03.430 --> 01:05.265
CROCODILES, AND LINED ALONG THE

01:05.265 --> 01:06.499
RIDGE OF THE RIVER, THERE WERE

01:06.499 --> 01:08.334
THOUSANDS OF AFRICAN TRIBESMEN,

01:08.334 --> 01:09.068
EACH HOLDING A SHIELD AND A

01:09.068 --> 01:11.638
SPEAR.

01:11.638 --> 01:13.606
AND IT WASN'T A NIGHTMARE.

01:13.606 --> 01:17.143
ACTUALLY, IT WAS A WET DREAM.

01:17.143 --> 01:19.279
WOW, WHAT A TWIST AT

01:19.279 --> 01:20.380
THE END THERE.

01:20.380 --> 01:21.681
"I KNOW MY DREAM MIGHT'VE

01:21.681 --> 01:23.349
CONTAINED SOME PRETTY DICEY

01:23.349 --> 01:25.151
RACIAL IMAGERY THERE, BUT WOULD

01:25.151 --> 01:26.219
IT HELP TO KNOW THAT, AT THE END

01:26.219 --> 01:28.455
OF IT, I EJACULATED?"

01:28.455 --> 01:29.422
THAT EVENT WAS-- AND THIS IS

01:29.422 --> 01:32.358
TRUE-- FIVE AND A HALF HOURS

01:32.358 --> 01:33.860
LONG, AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT

01:33.860 --> 01:34.794
LESSON YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LEARN

01:34.794 --> 01:39.132
IF YOU TRY

01:39.132 --> 01:40.133
TO DO DRUGS WITH

01:40.133 --> 01:40.733
MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY, YOU WILL

01:40.733 --> 01:41.367
DIE.

01:41.367 --> 01:42.335
BUT WE'RE GOING TO START IN THE

01:42.335 --> 01:43.837
UK, WHERE THE ECONOMY'S IN

01:43.837 --> 01:44.771
TURMOIL, AND THE BANK OF

01:44.771 --> 01:46.306
ENGLAND'S CHIEF ECONOMIST

01:46.306 --> 01:46.906
RECENTLY SAID THAT "WE'RE ALL

01:46.906 --> 01:48.141
WORSE OFF AND WE ALL HAVE TO

01:48.141 --> 01:49.943
TAKE OUR SHARE."

01:49.943 --> 01:51.411
WHICH MAKES IT A LESS-THAN-IDEAL

01:51.411 --> 01:53.513
TIME FOR THIS TO BE HAPPENING.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.148
THIS MORNING THE COUNTRY IS

01:55.148 --> 01:57.183
CORONATION READY WITH ONLY ONE

01:57.183 --> 01:58.551
WEEK TO GO UNTIL THE BIG DAY.

01:58.551 --> 02:00.386
BUCKINGHAM PALACE IS RELEASING

02:00.386 --> 02:01.454
THESE THREE BRAND-NEW IMAGES OF

02:01.454 --> 02:02.088
THE SOON TO BE CROWNED KING AND

02:02.088 --> 02:03.656
QUEEN.

02:03.656 --> 02:04.624
LAST-MINUTE PREPARATIONS ARE

02:04.624 --> 02:06.493
FEVERISHLY UNDERWAY; FROM

02:06.493 --> 02:08.294
LATE-NIGHT REHEARSALS INVOLVING

02:08.294 --> 02:10.363
HUNDREDS OF BRITISH MILITARY

02:10.363 --> 02:11.431
PERSONNEL ON HORSEBACK, TO

02:11.431 --> 02:13.366
POLISHING THE GRAND COACHES THE

02:13.366 --> 02:15.468
KING AND QUEEN WILL TRAVEL IN.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.903
YES, THE CORONATION OF

02:16.903 --> 02:17.837
THE WORLD'S LEAST LIKABLE ORPHAN

02:17.837 --> 02:20.974
IS LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY NOW.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.909
MEANING, THEY'RE REALLY GOING

02:22.909 --> 02:26.813
THROUGH WITH IT I GUESS.

02:26.813 --> 02:27.447
THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO PRINT

02:27.447 --> 02:28.281
BANKNOTES WITH THE IMAGE OF A

02:28.281 --> 02:29.015
MAN WHOSE FACE ONLY A MOTHER

02:29.015 --> 02:29.649
COULD LOVE AND ONLY TWO COUSINS

02:29.649 --> 02:33.453
COULD PRODUCE.

02:33.453 --> 02:34.053
THE CORONATION IS HAPPENING ON

02:34.053 --> 02:35.154
SATURDAY, AND WHILE PREPARATIONS

02:35.154 --> 02:35.855
HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR MONTHS

02:35.855 --> 02:36.923
NOW, THEY'VE ALSO HIT SOME SPEED

02:36.923 --> 02:38.191
BUMPS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES

02:38.191 --> 02:39.993
TO BOOKING MUSICAL ACTS FOR THE

02:39.993 --> 02:43.429
"CORONATION CONCERT."

02:43.429 --> 02:44.030
MANY TOP BRITISH PERFORMERS

02:44.030 --> 02:45.598
WON'T BE SINGING FOR THE KING.

02:45.598 --> 02:46.533
ACCORDING TO "ROLLING STONE,"

02:46.533 --> 02:48.201
STARS LIKE ADELE AND THE

02:48.201 --> 02:49.302
SPICE GIRLS.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.069
ALL REPORTEDLY TURNING THE

02:50.069 --> 02:52.372
OPPORTUNITY DOWN.

02:52.372 --> 02:53.606
ELTON JOHN, WHO REGULARLY

02:53.606 --> 02:55.174
PERFORMED AT CONCERTS FOR THE

02:55.174 --> 02:55.375
QUEEN.

02:55.375 --> 02:56.643
TELLING "ROLLING STONE" HE HAS

02:56.643 --> 02:58.645
SCHEDULING ISSUES.

02:58.645 --> 02:59.412
YEAH, OF COURSE HE

02:59.412 --> 03:00.513
DOES.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.748
ELTON JOHN WAS FAMOUSLY CLOSE

03:01.748 --> 03:03.149
FRIENDS WITH DIANA.

03:03.149 --> 03:04.517
IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY, HE EVEN

03:04.517 --> 03:05.718
CALLED HER, "INCREDIBLY

03:05.718 --> 03:06.953
INDISCREET, A REAL GOSSIP: YOU

03:06.953 --> 03:07.854
COULD ASK HER ANYTHING AND SHE'D

03:07.854 --> 03:09.389
TELL YOU."

03:09.389 --> 03:10.890
JUST LOOK AT THEM TOGETHER!

03:10.890 --> 03:11.858
THAT IS THE FACE OF A MAN

03:11.858 --> 03:13.560
LISTENING TO THE BEST GOSSIP

03:13.560 --> 03:16.663
ABOUT HER HUSBAND THAT'S HE'S

03:16.663 --> 03:17.430
EVER HEARD, WHILE STILL TRYING

03:17.430 --> 03:20.934
TO APPEAR SYMPATHETIC.

03:20.934 --> 03:21.568
CHARLES, ELTON JOHN KNOWS THINGS

03:21.568 --> 03:22.135
ABOUT YOU.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.169
AND NOT JUST THE TAMPON THING.

03:23.169 --> 03:24.938
WAY WORSE THAN THE TAMPON THING.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.239
SO NO, HE WILL NOT BE PLAYING AT

03:26.239 --> 03:27.006
YOUR BIG FANCY PARTY.

03:27.006 --> 03:29.042
AND TO BE HONEST?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.310
YOU DON'T WANT HIM THERE.

03:30.310 --> 03:31.411
AND LOOK, THIS IS CLEARLY A BIG

03:31.411 --> 03:32.412
MOMENT IN BRITISH HISTORY, BUT

03:32.412 --> 03:36.382
IT'S ALSO A REMINDER HOW

03:36.382 --> 03:37.283
INTERTWINED THE MONARCHY IS WITH

03:37.283 --> 03:37.917
THE GRIMMER MOMENTS OF THAT

03:37.917 --> 03:38.217
HISTORY.

03:38.217 --> 03:39.752
THE CHAIR IN WHICH CHARLES WILL

03:39.752 --> 03:40.587
SIT IS APPARENTLY MISSING A

03:40.587 --> 03:41.854
CORNER, THANKS TO A BOMB ATTACK

03:41.854 --> 03:43.156
IN 1914 THOUGHT TO BE ORGANIZED

03:43.156 --> 03:44.490
BY SUFFRAGETTES.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.259
AND THEY AVOIDED HAVING CAMILLA

03:46.259 --> 03:47.694
USE THIS CROWN DURING THE

03:47.694 --> 03:49.295
CORONATION, BECAUSE IT CONTAINS

03:49.295 --> 03:50.463
THE KOH-I-NOOR DIAMOND, WHICH,

03:50.463 --> 03:51.564
Y'KNOW...

03:51.564 --> 03:52.198
GOOGLE IT.

03:52.198 --> 03:53.566
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT TO

03:53.566 --> 03:54.734
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU, IT'S JUST

03:54.734 --> 03:55.902
THAT A PERSON WHO SOUNDS LIKE

03:55.902 --> 04:02.008
ME, BRITSPLAINING THE KOH-I-NOOR

04:02.008 --> 04:02.609
DIAMOND IS, TECHNICALLY, A WAR

04:02.609 --> 04:02.875
CRIME.

04:03.476 --> 04:04.077
AND ALL OF THIS COMES AS YOUNG

04:04.077 --> 04:04.711
BRITONS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING

04:04.711 --> 04:05.311
AGAINST THE MONARCHY.

04:05.311 --> 04:06.179
ONE POLL FOUND THAT ONLY A THIRD

04:06.179 --> 04:08.281
ACTIVELY BACK IT.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.183
THAT POLL, BY THE WAY, ALSO

04:10.183 --> 04:11.517
ASKED "DO YOU THINK KING CHARLES

04:11.517 --> 04:12.719
IN IN TOUCH, OR OUT OF TOUCH,

04:12.719 --> 04:13.419
WITH THE EXPERIENCES OF THE

04:13.419 --> 04:15.488
BRITISH PUBLIC?"

04:15.488 --> 04:16.723
AND I DON'T KNOW.

04:16.723 --> 04:17.290
IS THIS GUY OUT OF TOUCH?

04:17.290 --> 04:19.559
THIS GUY?

04:19.559 --> 04:21.027
IS THIS GUY-- SORRY, THAT'S HIS

04:21.027 --> 04:22.495
BROTHER WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN.

04:22.495 --> 04:25.231
IS THIS GUY?

04:25.231 --> 04:25.632
OUT OF TOUCH?

04:25.632 --> 04:26.966
WHO CAN REALLY SAY?

04:26.966 --> 04:27.967
STILL, BRITAIN'S GOING ALL-IN TO

04:27.967 --> 04:29.636
WHIP UP ENTHUSIASM.

04:29.636 --> 04:30.737
THIS CHOCOLATE BUST OF CHARLES

04:30.737 --> 04:32.005
WAS PRODUCED.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.172
WHICH MIGHT LOOK EVEN MORE LIKE

04:33.172 --> 04:33.806
HIM ONCE IT MELTS SLIGHTLY IN

04:33.806 --> 04:35.041
THE SUN.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.976
AND THEN THERE WAS THE

04:36.976 --> 04:37.610
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CORONATION'S

04:37.610 --> 04:39.612
OFFICIAL DISH.

04:39.612 --> 04:40.580
THE KING AND QUEEN CONSORT

04:40.580 --> 04:42.548
HAVE UNVEILED THEIR CORONATION

04:42.548 --> 04:43.816
QUICHE.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.318
THE SAVORY TART WILL BE SERVED

04:45.318 --> 04:46.986
AT BIG LUNCHES CELEBRATING NEXT

04:46.986 --> 04:47.787
MONTH'S EVENT.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.956
A CRISP, LIGHT PASTRY CASE,

04:49.956 --> 04:53.126
FILLED WITH THE DELICATE FLAVORS

04:53.126 --> 04:54.360
OF SPINACH, BROAD BEANS, AND

04:54.360 --> 04:55.662
FRESH TARRAGON.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.230
BUT AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE, IT

04:57.230 --> 04:58.598
SEEMS IT MIGHT NOT TICKLE ALL

04:58.598 --> 05:00.433
MODERN TASTE BUDS.

05:00.433 --> 05:01.367
I'M FINE WITH THE SPINACH,

05:01.367 --> 05:01.934
BUT I'LL PASS ON THE BROAD

05:01.934 --> 05:06.139
BEANS.

05:06.139 --> 05:06.773
I AIN'T GOING TO LIE TO YOU,

05:06.773 --> 05:07.273
THAT SOUNDS DISGUSTING.

05:07.273 --> 05:07.874
YEAH, IT DOES!

05:07.874 --> 05:08.775
BUT TO BE FAIR, THAT'S BECAUSE

05:08.775 --> 05:10.877
IT'S A QUICHE.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.679
IT'S PIE'S WEIRD CAMP FRIEND.

05:12.679 --> 05:13.980
AND ON QUICHE'S BEST DAY, IT'S

05:13.980 --> 05:15.281
NOTHING.

05:15.281 --> 05:16.916
THE MOST A QUICHE CAN EVER HOPE

05:16.916 --> 05:18.051
TO MAKE YOU FEEL IS, "SLIGHTLY

05:18.051 --> 05:20.253
MORE FULL OF QUICHE."

05:20.253 --> 05:21.654
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, THE

05:21.654 --> 05:22.989
CORONATION QUICHE MIGHT BE A

05:22.989 --> 05:23.823
PERFECT FIT FOR CHARLES, BECAUSE

05:23.823 --> 05:24.791
IT'S SPECTACULARLY ORDINARY AND

05:24.791 --> 05:26.092
CONTAINS AN UNLIKEABLE

05:26.092 --> 05:28.428
COMBINATION OF INGREDIENTS.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.897
STILL, IT'S TAKEN UP A TRULY

05:30.897 --> 05:31.531
STUPID AMOUNT OF TIME ON BRITISH

05:31.531 --> 05:34.534
TV.

05:34.534 --> 05:35.468
CHEFS HAVE MADE IT, HOSTS HAVE

05:35.468 --> 05:37.036
DISCUSSED IT, PEOPLE HAVE EATEN

05:37.036 --> 05:38.671
IT, BUT THE QUICHE COVERAGE

05:38.671 --> 05:40.139
REACHED ITS ABSURD APEX WHEN

05:40.139 --> 05:41.674
NIGEL FARAGE APPEARED ON

05:41.674 --> 05:42.608
AUSTRALIAN TV TO TRY AND

05:42.608 --> 05:43.543
POLITICIZE IT.

05:43.543 --> 05:45.845
SO, WE LEARNED TODAY THAT THE

05:45.845 --> 05:48.114
OFFICIAL CORONATION CAKE IS A

05:48.114 --> 05:50.049
VEGAN QUICHE.

05:50.049 --> 05:54.487
HOW BORING.

05:54.487 --> 05:55.288
OH DEAR, OH DEAR, OH DEAR.

05:55.288 --> 05:58.725
MY HEART SUNK WHEN I SAW THAT

05:58.725 --> 05:59.125
NEWS THIS MORNING.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.626
SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT

06:00.626 --> 06:01.394
YOUR HEART SANK WHEN YOU SAW

06:01.394 --> 06:03.229
THAT NEWS?

06:03.229 --> 06:04.831
THERE ARE WARS GOING ON, NIGEL.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.099
EVERY DAY THE EARTH GETS ONE

06:06.099 --> 06:07.300
DEGREE CLOSER TO DEATH AND IT

06:07.300 --> 06:08.301
LOOKS LIKE CARRIE IS GETTING

06:08.301 --> 06:10.203
BACK TOGETHER WITH AIDEN, BUT

06:10.203 --> 06:11.003
THIS IS WHAT MUSTERED EMOTION

06:11.003 --> 06:11.938
OUT OF YOU?

06:11.938 --> 06:12.705
ALSO, FOR THE RECORD, IT'S NOT

06:12.705 --> 06:14.440
VEGAN.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.542
QUICHE IS PRETTY FAMOUSLY AN EGG

06:16.542 --> 06:19.345
BASED DISH.

06:19.345 --> 06:20.213
VEGANS DON'T EAT EGGS.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.614
YOU'D KNOW THAT IF YOU'D EVER

06:21.614 --> 06:22.849
LISTENED TO A VEGAN.

06:22.849 --> 06:23.883
IT'S NOT THAT HARD, THEY'RE

06:23.883 --> 06:25.084
LITERALLY ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT

06:25.084 --> 06:26.285
IT.

06:26.285 --> 06:27.420
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THAT SEGMENT

06:27.420 --> 06:28.821
EVEN CONTINUED.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.289
I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

06:30.289 --> 06:31.824
HERE OR WHAT WE'RE WARMING UP TO

06:31.824 --> 06:33.259
POTENTIALLY IS THE AUSTERITY

06:33.259 --> 06:35.394
CORONATION.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.062
UGH.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.030
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL

06:38.030 --> 06:39.565
AS ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSIBLE AS

06:39.565 --> 06:41.300
WE POSSIBLY CAN BE, AND SO IN

06:41.300 --> 06:43.169
KEEPING WITH THAT, THEY HAVE

06:43.169 --> 06:44.737
PRODUCED THE DULLEST, MOST

06:44.737 --> 06:47.106
UNINSPIRING, AND MOST

06:47.106 --> 06:48.641
POLITICALLY CORRECT DISH THAT

06:48.641 --> 06:50.710
HAS EVER BEEN PRODUCED FOR A

06:50.710 --> 06:51.344
MAJOR OCCASION IN THIS COUNTRY.

06:51.344 --> 06:54.046
IT IS TRULY GHASTLY.

06:54.046 --> 06:55.815
I MEAN, I DO KIND OF

06:55.815 --> 06:57.049
GET WHERE HE'S COMING FROM.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.117
YOU COULD ARGUE THIS IS A

06:58.117 --> 06:59.352
BELT-TIGHTENING DISH FOR A

06:59.352 --> 07:00.019
COUNTRY WHOSE ECONOMY IS

07:00.019 --> 07:02.355
STRUGGLING.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.756
AND IT KIND OF MAKES YOU WONDER

07:03.756 --> 07:05.391
WHAT PACK OF DIPSHITS DROVE

07:05.391 --> 07:06.859
BRITAIN OFF A FINANCIAL CLIFF IN

07:06.859 --> 07:08.361
THE FIRST PLACE, BUT I GUESS A

07:08.361 --> 07:08.995
"FORMER BREXIT LEADER" WOULDN'T

07:08.995 --> 07:10.363
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.664
AND LOOK, AT THE END OF THE DAY,

07:11.664 --> 07:12.398
THE REASON EVERYONE'S

07:12.398 --> 07:13.666
DESPERATELY TALKING ABOUT

07:13.666 --> 07:16.202
CHARLES WANTING EVERYONE TO HAVE

07:16.202 --> 07:19.572
BEAN QUICHE AT HIS FAKE JOB

07:19.572 --> 07:20.339
PARTY IS THAT IT'S CLEARLY MORE

07:20.339 --> 07:20.873
INTERESTING THAN HE IS.

07:20.873 --> 07:21.407
WHICH IS A PROBLEM FOR THE

07:21.407 --> 07:22.074
MONARCHY.

07:22.074 --> 07:22.942
BUT THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL

07:22.942 --> 07:23.810
FIXES HERE.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.244
IF I MAY, WHEN IT COMES TO THE

07:25.244 --> 07:25.978
QUICHE, YOU COULD REPLACE THE

07:25.978 --> 07:27.947
BEANS WITH CARAMELIZED LEEKS.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.282
YOU COULD SWAP OUT THE CHEDDAR

07:29.282 --> 07:29.916
WITH GRUYERE, AND A DASH OF GOAT

07:29.916 --> 07:31.417
CHEESE.

07:31.417 --> 07:32.718
ALSO, YOU COULD ADD A DRIZZLE OF

07:32.718 --> 07:33.319
HONEY FOR SOME BALANCE, MAYBE

07:33.319 --> 07:35.188
SPICY HONEY FOR SOME DEPTH IF

07:35.188 --> 07:36.689
YOU'RE FEELING CHEEKY.

07:36.689 --> 07:37.223
THEN, TO SERVE-- AND THIS

07:37.223 --> 07:39.826
PART'S CRUCIAL-- I'D RECOMMEND

07:39.826 --> 07:40.626
TAKING THAT QUICHE, AND THROWING

07:40.626 --> 07:45.264
IT STRAIGHT IN THE FUCKING

07:45.264 --> 07:45.865
TRASH, ALONG WITH THE MONARCHY

07:45.865 --> 07:46.432
ITSELF, SO THAT BRITAIN CAN

07:46.432 --> 07:47.466
FINALLY STOP HEMORRHAGING MONEY

07:47.466 --> 07:48.734
SUPPORTING A FAMILY OF LIGHTLY

07:48.734 --> 07:50.636
INBRED BILLIONAIRES.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.605
AND NOW THIS.

07:52.605 --> 07:54.807
AND NOW, IS

07:54.807 --> 07:57.143
MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY OKAY?

07:57.143 --> 08:00.046
YES, THE FUTURE IS FOGGY.

08:00.046 --> 08:01.681
AND IT SEEMS LIKE ON THIS

08:01.681 --> 08:03.082
HIGHWAY CALLED LIFE, EVERYBODY'S

08:03.082 --> 08:05.685
GOT THEIR HAZARDS LIGHTS ON.

08:05.685 --> 08:06.886
YOU KNOW, MY APPETITE MIGHT BE

08:06.886 --> 08:08.654
YOUR INDIGESTION.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.722
YOUR APPETITE MIGHT MAKE MY

08:09.722 --> 08:16.162
STOMACH QUEASY.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.396
WE ARE NOT ALWAYS ALL READY TO

08:17.396 --> 08:18.364
CHANGE FROM THE CATERPILLAR TO

08:18.364 --> 08:18.698
THE BUTTERFLY.

08:18.698 --> 08:20.132
SOMETIMES WE WANT TO COCOON.

08:20.132 --> 08:21.601
THOSE VERY TRUTHS, DUTIES, AND

08:21.601 --> 08:22.068
TOOLS.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.603
THOSE ARE WHAT WE ARE GOING TO

08:23.603 --> 08:25.905
NEED TO BUILD THAT ROCKET SHIP

08:25.905 --> 08:26.539
TO GET US TO THOSE STARS THAT WE

08:26.539 --> 08:32.912
ARE SHOOTING FOR.

08:32.912 --> 08:34.547
WHETHER IT'S THE FUTURE OF THE

08:34.547 --> 08:35.948
UNKNOWN OR OUR FLAWS.

08:35.948 --> 08:36.883
WE HAVE TO LOOK THE MONSTER

08:36.883 --> 08:37.483
IN THE EYE.

08:37.483 --> 08:38.150
AND HOLD THAT SON OF A BITCH'S

08:38.150 --> 08:41.587
GAZE.

08:41.587 --> 08:42.188
YOU CAN MEASURE YOUR MISTRUST

08:42.188 --> 08:42.788
IN OUNCES, BUT YOU CAN MEASURE

08:42.788 --> 08:47.326
TRUST IN POUNDS.

08:47.326 --> 08:48.561
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE RECIPE FOR

08:48.561 --> 08:49.695
YOUR PARTICULAR SECRET SAUCES

08:49.695 --> 08:50.396
UNDER THE HOOD OF WHAT YOU DO

08:50.396 --> 08:51.264
WELL.

08:51.264 --> 08:57.470
NOT WHAT YOU DON'T.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.471
NOW I FALL DOWN, I GET UP

08:58.471 --> 09:00.673
AND DUST MYSELF OFF LIKE THAT.

09:00.673 --> 09:13.286
I STEP IN A PILE OF SHIT, I KEEP

09:13.286 --> 09:13.920
RUNNING WHILE I'M CLEANING THAT

09:13.920 --> 09:15.388
SHIT OFF MY SHOE ON THE GO.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.789
IF I STEP IN THE SAME PILE OF

09:16.789 --> 09:17.390
SHIT EVERY I'M AROUND THE BEND

09:17.390 --> 09:19.292
BECAUSE I NEVER TAKE STOCK OR

09:19.292 --> 09:19.926
INVENTORY OF WHERE THAT PILE OF

09:19.926 --> 09:20.493
SHIT THAT I KEEP STEPPING IN

09:20.493 --> 09:20.660
WAS.

09:20.660 --> 09:21.427
MOVING ON.

09:21.427 --> 09:22.328
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

09:22.328 --> 09:24.797
IMMIGRATION.

09:24.797 --> 09:25.464
IT'S THE REASON I'M HERE.

09:25.464 --> 09:26.699
WELL, THE REASON I'M "IN THIS

09:26.699 --> 09:27.233
COUNTRY."

09:27.233 --> 09:31.771
NOT THE REASON I EXIST.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.739
THE REASON FOR THAT SHOULD BE

09:33.739 --> 09:35.474
A TAX ACCOUNTANT FUCKED

09:35.474 --> 09:36.409
A STORK, AND VOILA, HERE I AM!

09:36.409 --> 09:36.976
SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE GOING TO

09:36.976 --> 09:37.610
TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION ON OUR

09:37.610 --> 09:39.679
SOUTHERN BORDER.

09:39.679 --> 09:40.313
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING:

09:40.313 --> 09:40.846
YOU'RE THINKING, FINALLY,

09:40.846 --> 09:41.480
SOMEONE IS GOING TO ADDRESS THE

09:41.480 --> 09:43.516
MAGNIFICENT STATUE IN EL PASO

09:43.516 --> 09:44.050
KNOWN AS "PILE O' GATORS,"

09:44.050 --> 09:44.617
FEATURING WHAT LOOKS LIKE A

09:44.617 --> 09:45.451
BUNCH OF HORNY REPTILES ENGAGING

09:45.451 --> 09:47.586
IN A SLOPPY SWAMP ORGY.

09:47.586 --> 09:48.587
BUT WHILE THAT'S CERTAINLY A

09:48.587 --> 09:49.622
SITUATION ON THE BORDER, IT'S

09:49.622 --> 09:50.723
SADLY NOT "THE SITUATION," WHICH

09:50.723 --> 09:52.224
REFERS TO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

09:52.224 --> 09:53.292
MIGRANTS DOWN THERE.

09:53.292 --> 09:54.460
AND IF YOU ASK POLITICIANS ON

09:54.460 --> 09:58.364
THE RIGHT, THAT SITUATION CAN BE

09:58.364 --> 09:58.898
BEST SUMMED UP LIKE THIS.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.399
OUR BORDER IS WIDE OPEN AND

10:00.399 --> 10:01.701
OUT OF CONTROL AND AMERICANS ARE

10:01.701 --> 10:03.002
DYING BECAUSE OF IT.

10:03.002 --> 10:04.170
THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE IS AN

10:04.170 --> 10:05.137
INVASION HAPPENING AT OUR

10:05.137 --> 10:06.739
SOUTHERN BORDER.

10:06.739 --> 10:07.673
MIGRANTS ARE ABSOLUTELY

10:07.673 --> 10:09.508
INVADING THIS COUNTRY.

10:09.508 --> 10:14.513
OUR COUNTRY IS UNDER ATTACK.

10:14.513 --> 10:17.817
AMERICA IS BEING INVADED.

10:17.817 --> 10:20.052
NO AMERICAN IS SAFE.

10:20.052 --> 10:20.619
OKAY.

10:20.619 --> 10:21.721
LET'S FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE THE

10:21.721 --> 10:23.389
IRONY OF COWARDLY FREAKING OUT

10:23.389 --> 10:24.423
ABOUT MIGRANTS IN FRONT OF A

10:24.423 --> 10:26.959
SIGN THAT READS "MR. STRONG."

10:26.959 --> 10:29.061
NEVER BEFORE HAS A NAME PLATE

10:29.061 --> 10:30.329
FELT SO INTENSELY SARCASTIC.

10:30.329 --> 10:32.665
BUT ALSO, SETTING ASIDE THE

10:32.665 --> 10:34.467
BLATANT XENOPHOBIA, ARE THE TWO

10:34.467 --> 10:36.435
OF YOU WEARING MATCHING OUTFITS?

10:36.435 --> 10:38.037
BECAUSE IT SURE FEELS LIKE YOU

10:38.037 --> 10:39.338
MET UP AT MEN'S WEARHOUSE, MADE

10:39.338 --> 10:40.406
A BEELINE FOR "THE CAUCASIAN

10:40.406 --> 10:41.540
COLLECTION," PICKED OUT THE

10:41.540 --> 10:42.742
EXACT SAME SUIT, AND THEN WORE

10:42.742 --> 10:43.843
IT LIKE "TWEEDLEDUM" AND

10:43.843 --> 10:46.979
"TWEEDLE-DEPORTATION."

10:46.979 --> 10:48.447
THE RIGHT HAS BEEN FEARMONGERING

10:48.447 --> 10:49.915
ABOUT IMMIGRATION EVEN MORE THAN

10:49.915 --> 10:51.584
USUAL LATELY.

10:51.584 --> 10:52.618
AND TO BE FAIR-- ACTUALLY, I

10:52.618 --> 10:53.085
DON'T HAVE TO BE FAIR.

10:53.085 --> 10:53.786
FUCK THEM.

10:53.786 --> 10:56.956
BUT TO BE FAIRER THAN THEY

10:56.956 --> 10:57.590
ACTUALLY DESERVE, THERE IS A LOT

10:57.590 --> 10:58.257
HAPPENING AT THE BORDER RIGHT

10:58.257 --> 10:58.791
NOW.

10:58.791 --> 10:59.792
THE NUMBER OF MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS

10:59.792 --> 11:00.860
THERE, WHICH WAS RISING BEFORE

11:00.860 --> 11:01.694
BIDEN CAME INTO OFFICE, REACHED

11:01.694 --> 11:04.296
A RECORD HIGH LAST YEAR.

11:04.296 --> 11:05.431
NOW, THAT'S HAPPENED FOR A

11:05.431 --> 11:07.666
NUMBER OF REASONS, INCLUDING

11:07.666 --> 11:08.300
WE'RE COMING OUT OF A

11:08.300 --> 11:09.201
GLOBAL PANDEMIC, AND MULTIPLE

11:09.201 --> 11:10.136
COUNTRIES, FROM HAITI TO

11:10.136 --> 11:10.703
VENEZUELA TO UKRAINE, ARE IN

11:10.703 --> 11:11.570
CRISIS RIGHT NOW.

11:11.570 --> 11:12.872
SO THERE'S A HIGH NUMBER OF

11:12.872 --> 11:13.506
PEOPLE FORCED TO FLEE THEIR

11:13.506 --> 11:14.840
HOMES.

11:14.840 --> 11:15.975
PLUS, SOME ASYLUM SEEKERS MAY,

11:15.975 --> 11:17.143
UNDERSTANDABLY, HAVE BEEN

11:17.143 --> 11:18.444
ENCOURAGED BY BIDEN'S RHETORIC

11:18.444 --> 11:19.545
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, WHICH WAS

11:19.545 --> 11:21.280
NOTABLY DIFFERENT THAN HIS

11:21.280 --> 11:23.349
OPPONENT.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.850
LOOK, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT

11:24.850 --> 11:26.419
IT'S LIKE TO SEE SOMEONE IN YOUR

11:26.419 --> 11:27.553
FAMILY DEPORTED.

11:27.553 --> 11:27.987
THAT'S RIGHT.

11:27.987 --> 11:28.821
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT

11:28.821 --> 11:30.322
THAT'S LIKE.

11:30.322 --> 11:31.557
AND I'VE-- TO ME, IT'S ALL

11:31.557 --> 11:32.591
ABOUT FAMILY.

11:32.591 --> 11:33.759
BEGINNING, MIDDLE, AND END, IT'S

11:33.759 --> 11:35.261
ABOUT FAMILY.

11:35.261 --> 11:37.163
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN MY

11:37.163 --> 11:37.630
ADMINISTRATION.

11:37.630 --> 11:38.798
THE IDEA YOU CAN'T EVEN SEEK

11:38.798 --> 11:42.435
ASYLUM ON AMERICAN SOIL?

11:42.435 --> 11:43.502
CAN'T EVEN SEEK ASYLUM ON

11:43.502 --> 11:45.337
AMERICAN SOIL?

11:45.337 --> 11:46.605
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

11:46.605 --> 11:47.506
TRUMP.

11:47.506 --> 11:48.474
IT'S WRONG.

11:48.474 --> 11:49.308
YOU'RE GOING TO CHANGE THAT?

11:49.308 --> 11:50.876
YES, I AM.

11:50.876 --> 11:51.944
YEAH, IT'S ALL ABOUT

11:51.944 --> 11:53.279
FAMILY, BEGINNING MIDDLE AND

11:53.279 --> 11:53.846
END, WHATEVER THE FUCK THAT

11:53.846 --> 11:56.082
MEANS.

11:56.082 --> 11:57.716
A PRETTY EMPTY PHRASE FROM A

11:57.716 --> 11:58.751
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, BUT TO

11:58.751 --> 11:59.919
BE HONEST, A PRETTY GOOD TAGLINE

11:59.919 --> 12:01.420
FOR "FAST X."

12:01.420 --> 12:03.155
IT'S ONLY MILDLY LESS

12:03.155 --> 12:03.823
COMPREHENSIBLE THAN "THE END OF

12:03.823 --> 12:06.826
THE ROAD BEGINS."

12:06.826 --> 12:07.993
BUT AT THE TIME, THAT PROMISE

12:07.993 --> 12:09.762
SOUNDED GOOD.

12:09.762 --> 12:10.930
IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT EVEN

12:10.930 --> 12:11.831
IF BIDEN WASN'T YOUR FAVORITE

12:11.831 --> 12:13.399
CANDIDATE-- EVEN IF HE WAS YOUR

12:13.399 --> 12:14.033
LEAST FAVORITE CANDIDATE--

12:14.033 --> 12:15.668
AFTER FOUR YEARS OF TRUMP, THAT

12:15.668 --> 12:17.703
WAS PRETTY REFRESHING.

12:17.703 --> 12:18.904
IT'S LIKE WANDERING THROUGH THE

12:18.904 --> 12:20.039
SAHARA DESERT FOR FOUR YEARS AND

12:20.039 --> 12:22.541
ALL OF A SUDDEN SEEING A PANERA.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.276
I MEAN, IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

12:24.276 --> 12:26.178
PARADISE IN ITS OWN RIGHT, BUT

12:26.178 --> 12:27.179
COMPARED WITH WHAT YOU JUST WENT

12:27.179 --> 12:28.080
THROUGH?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.882
YOU'D KILL FOR AN ASIAGO TURKEY

12:29.882 --> 12:30.449
SANDWICH AND A LEMONADE, NO

12:30.449 --> 12:32.952
QUESTION.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.520
PROMISES LIKE THAT ARE WHY WE

12:34.520 --> 12:36.021
CITED BIDEN'S POTENTIAL TO UNDO

12:36.021 --> 12:37.690
TRUMP'S DAMAGE ON IMMIGRATION AS

12:37.690 --> 12:39.492
A KEY REASON TO VOTE FOR HIM,

12:39.492 --> 12:41.594
JUST A WEEK BEFORE THE ELECTION.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.728
NOW, DID WE MAKE THE DIFFERENCE?

12:42.728 --> 12:44.063
WHO CAN SAY?

12:44.063 --> 12:46.899
NURSES ARE THE REAL HEROES.

12:46.899 --> 12:48.434
UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN IT COMES TO

12:48.434 --> 12:50.169
THE SOUTHERN BORDER, BIDEN HAS

12:50.169 --> 12:52.037
DISAPPOINTED IN A LOT OF WAYS.

12:52.037 --> 12:52.872
BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE'S OPENED

12:52.872 --> 12:54.974
UP THE COUNTRY TO AN "INVASION"

12:54.974 --> 12:55.808
IT'S ACTUALLY, IN MANY WAYS, THE

12:55.808 --> 13:00.412
OPPOSITE.

13:00.412 --> 13:01.280
MANY MIGRANTS, INCLUDING ASYLUM

13:01.280 --> 13:01.814
SEEKERS, ARE FINDING IT

13:01.814 --> 13:02.515
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCESS THIS

13:02.515 --> 13:04.016
COUNTRY THROUGH OUR PORTS OF

13:04.016 --> 13:05.050
ENTRY, AND THE CONDITIONS THEY

13:05.050 --> 13:05.751
ARE FACING ARE DIRE.

13:05.751 --> 13:07.353
IN MANY BORDER CITIES SHELTERS

13:07.353 --> 13:08.654
AND DETENTION CENTERS ARE

13:08.654 --> 13:10.389
REPORTEDLY NEAR CAPACITY, WITH

13:10.389 --> 13:11.257
THE DIRECTOR OF ONE OF THEM

13:11.257 --> 13:12.658
SAYING, "EVERY DAY I TURN AWAY

13:12.658 --> 13:13.192
AT LEAST TEN FAMILIES WITH

13:13.192 --> 13:15.294
CHILDREN."

13:15.294 --> 13:16.262
AND JUST LAST MONTH, AT LEAST 40

13:16.262 --> 13:18.097
PEOPLE DIED WHEN A MIGRANT

13:18.097 --> 13:20.099
CENTER CAUGHT FIRE.

13:20.099 --> 13:21.500
AND FRUSTRATINGLY, A LOT OF THIS

13:21.500 --> 13:23.269
HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY U.S.

13:23.269 --> 13:24.470
POLICIES THAT ARE WELL WITHIN

13:24.470 --> 13:26.138
BIDEN'S POWER TO REMEDY.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.274
AND YET, HE HASN'T.

13:28.274 --> 13:29.608
AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT OUR

13:29.608 --> 13:30.543
STORY IS ABOUT TONIGHT.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.211
IT'S ABOUT WHAT BIDEN PROMISED

13:32.211 --> 13:34.113
TO DO, WHAT HE HAS AND HASN'T

13:34.113 --> 13:35.114
DONE, AND HOW HIS LATEST EFFORTS

13:35.114 --> 13:37.650
TO FIX THINGS MIGHT ACTUALLY

13:37.650 --> 13:38.017
MAKE THEM WORSE.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.084
AND FIRST, LET'S ACKNOWLEDGE

13:39.084 --> 13:40.619
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSESS WHAT

13:40.619 --> 13:42.855
BIDEN'S DONE AT THE BORDER

13:42.855 --> 13:43.389
WITHOUT LOOKING AT WHAT HE

13:43.389 --> 13:45.191
INHERITED.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.092
TRUMP CAMPAIGNED ON HIGH-OCTANE

13:47.092 --> 13:49.862
XENOPHOBIA, AND HIS POLICIES

13:49.862 --> 13:50.930
REFLECTED THAT, FROM LARGE-SCALE

13:50.930 --> 13:51.797
FAMILY SEPARATION TO ATTACKING

13:51.797 --> 13:53.666
DACA, TO HIS SO-CALLED "REMAIN

13:53.666 --> 13:55.267
IN MEXICO" POLICY, WHICH LED TO

13:55.267 --> 13:57.937
MASSIVE ENCAMPMENTS OF WOULD-BE

13:57.937 --> 13:59.038
ASYLUM SEEKERS, SOUTH OF THE

13:59.038 --> 14:00.272
BORDER.

14:00.272 --> 14:00.873
AND TRUMP APPROACHED ALL OF IT

14:00.873 --> 14:03.008
WITH HIS SIGNATURE CLARITY.

14:03.008 --> 14:03.576
THE IMMIGRATION LAWS ARE

14:03.576 --> 14:04.677
HORRIBLE.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.844
WE'RE DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB.

14:05.844 --> 14:06.946
WE'RE DOING A RECORD-BREAKING

14:06.946 --> 14:08.080
JOB, BUT WE HAVE BAD LAWS.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.848
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE BAD LAWS

14:09.848 --> 14:11.517
YOU CAN DO GOOD BUT YOU CAN DO A

14:11.517 --> 14:14.286
LOT BETTER IF YOU HAD GOOD LAWS.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.554
OKAY, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

14:15.554 --> 14:16.188
TOTAL GIBBERISH, BUT IF YOU LOOK

14:16.188 --> 14:17.122
AT WHAT HE'S SAYING CLOSELY,

14:17.122 --> 14:18.357
YOU'LL FIND IT'S ALSO, AND THIS

14:18.357 --> 14:24.897
IS TRUE, A HAIKU.

14:25.497 --> 14:26.932
I'M KIDDING, IT'S ABSOLUTELY

14:26.932 --> 14:27.566
NOT, BUT WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF

14:27.566 --> 14:27.866
IT WAS?

14:27.866 --> 14:28.934
IF THAT BUFFOON WAS CAPABLE OF

14:28.934 --> 14:29.768
ACCIDENTAL BEAUTY?

14:29.768 --> 14:30.903
BUT IT'S NOT, AND HE ISN'T.

14:30.903 --> 14:33.706
SO WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.174
NOW, TO BIDEN'S CREDIT, HE

14:35.174 --> 14:36.308
CREATED A TASK FORCE TO REUNIFY

14:36.308 --> 14:37.509
THE SEPARATED FAMILIES, HE

14:37.509 --> 14:38.744
STRENGTHENED PROTECTIONS AROUND

14:38.744 --> 14:40.246
DACA, AND HE SUSPENDED THE

14:40.246 --> 14:41.614
"REMAIN IN MEXICO" POLICY.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.416
AND YET, THERE REMAIN HUGE

14:44.416 --> 14:45.884
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE, STUCK JUST

14:45.884 --> 14:46.452
SOUTH OF THE BORDER, IN CAMPS

14:46.452 --> 14:47.987
THAT LOOK AN AWFUL LOT LIKE THE

14:47.987 --> 14:49.121
ONES THAT WERE THERE DURING

14:49.121 --> 14:49.855
TRUMP.

14:49.855 --> 14:53.025
AND A SIGNIFICANT REASON FOR

14:53.025 --> 14:53.592
THAT HAS TO DO WITH A POLICY

14:53.592 --> 14:54.693
CALLED TITLE 42, WHICH ALLOWS

14:54.693 --> 14:55.928
THE U.S. TO KICK MIGRANTS OUT OF

14:55.928 --> 14:57.596
THE COUNTRY WITH SHOCKING EASE.

14:57.596 --> 15:00.432
AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT

15:00.432 --> 15:02.001
BEFORE, BUT JUST AS A REFRESHER:

15:02.001 --> 15:02.701
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY AN IMMIGRATION

15:02.701 --> 15:04.270
LAW AT ALL.

15:04.270 --> 15:04.970
IT'S AN ARCANE PUBLIC HEALTH

15:04.970 --> 15:06.505
ORDER, AIMED AT PREVENTING THE

15:06.505 --> 15:08.807
SPREAD OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES.

15:08.807 --> 15:10.809
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

15:10.809 --> 15:11.510
IMPLEMENTED IT IN MARCH OF 2020,

15:11.510 --> 15:13.245
INVOKING IT AS A SAFETY

15:13.245 --> 15:14.880
PRECAUTION INTENDED TO PREVENT

15:14.880 --> 15:15.981
COVID-19 FROM SPREADING THROUGH

15:15.981 --> 15:17.783
BORDER PATROL STATIONS.

15:17.783 --> 15:19.518
BUT THE TRUTH IS, LONG BEFORE

15:19.518 --> 15:21.854
COVID, ITS USE HAD BEEN FLOATED

15:21.854 --> 15:23.789
BY STEPHEN MILLER, A CHILD'S

15:23.789 --> 15:25.224
ANSWER TO THE PROMPT, "DRAW

15:25.224 --> 15:28.160
SQUIDWARD FROM MEMORY."

15:28.160 --> 15:29.728
IN FACT, THE INVOCATION OF

15:29.728 --> 15:30.963
TITLE 42 WAS REFERRED, TO "A

15:30.963 --> 15:32.998
STEPHEN MILLER SPECIAL

15:32.998 --> 15:33.899
HE WAS ALL OVER THAT," A

15:33.899 --> 15:35.634
SENTENCE I HOPE NO ONE HAS TO

15:35.634 --> 15:37.336
SPEAK OR HEAR EVER AGAIN.

15:37.336 --> 15:38.737
AND MILLER HAS BRAGGED ABOUT

15:38.737 --> 15:41.707
TITLE 42'S SWEEPING POWERS.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.409
THE PRINCIPLE OF IT IS VERY

15:43.409 --> 15:46.612
SIMPLE, WHICH IS THAT, DURING A

15:46.612 --> 15:48.080
PANDEMIC, IF YOU COME INTO THIS

15:48.080 --> 15:50.683
COUNTRY, YOUR VERY PRESENCE

15:50.683 --> 15:53.052
HERE, IF YOU ENTER UNLAWFULLY,

15:53.052 --> 15:54.920
IS A THREAT TO OUR PUBLIC

15:54.920 --> 15:56.755
HEALTH, FULL STOP.

15:56.755 --> 15:59.258
YOU GO HOME.

15:59.258 --> 16:00.693
OKAY FIRST, I'M PRETTY

16:00.693 --> 16:01.794
SURE IF YOU PLAYED THE SOUND OF

16:01.794 --> 16:02.961
STEPHEN MILLER'S VOICE IN A

16:02.961 --> 16:05.431
MATERNITY WARD, A NEWBORN INFANT

16:05.431 --> 16:06.465
WOULD INSTINCTIVELY SAY--

16:06.465 --> 16:08.334
DESPITE NOT HAVING ANY KNOWLEDGE

16:08.334 --> 16:10.369
OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE-- "SHUT

16:10.369 --> 16:12.504
THE FUCK UP."

16:12.504 --> 16:13.472
BECAUSE THAT "THREAT TO OUR

16:13.472 --> 16:13.972
PUBLIC HEALTH" LINE WAS

16:13.972 --> 16:16.275
BULLSHIT.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.977
WHILE TRUMP CLAIMED THE ORDER

16:18.977 --> 16:20.279
ORIGINATED WITH THE CDC, ONE

16:20.279 --> 16:22.414
FORMER HEALTH OFFICIAL SAID THEY

16:22.414 --> 16:23.048
WERE EFFECTIVELY FORCED TO

16:23.048 --> 16:31.857
IMPLEMENT IT, ADDING BUT THE

16:31.857 --> 16:33.859
DO IT OR GET FIRED.

16:33.859 --> 16:34.893
THE REASON TRUMP SEIZED ON IT IS

16:34.893 --> 16:36.929
PRETTY OBVIOUS.

16:36.929 --> 16:37.496
UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES,

16:37.496 --> 16:38.897
MIGRANTS HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO

16:38.897 --> 16:40.733
ASK FOR ASYLUM, NO MATTER WHERE

16:40.733 --> 16:42.534
THEY CROSS THE BORDER.

16:42.534 --> 16:45.003
BUT LIKE INCEL CAILLOU SAID,

16:45.003 --> 16:46.739
TITLE 42 GAVE THE GOVERNMENT THE

16:46.739 --> 16:48.340
POWER TO RAPIDLY EXPEL ANY

16:48.340 --> 16:50.109
MIGRANT WITHOUT GIVING THEM AN

16:50.109 --> 16:51.176
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A CASE FOR

16:51.176 --> 16:52.845
STAYING IN THE COUNTRY LEGALLY,

16:52.845 --> 16:55.614
INCLUDING TO SEEK ASYLUM.

16:55.614 --> 16:56.548
AND YOU'D HOPE THAT, UPON TAKING

16:56.548 --> 16:59.585
OFFICE, BIDEN WOULD MOVE AS FAST

16:59.585 --> 17:00.886
AS POSSIBLE TO GET RID OF IT.

17:00.886 --> 17:01.620
BUT INSTEAD, HIS

17:01.620 --> 17:02.221
ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN ALL OVER

17:02.221 --> 17:03.989
THE PLACE.

17:03.989 --> 17:04.556
JUST A FEW MONTHS INTO HIS

17:04.556 --> 17:06.091
PRESIDENCY, HIS SECRETARY OF

17:06.091 --> 17:07.659
HOMELAND SECURITY SENT THIS

17:07.659 --> 17:08.594
MESSAGE TO POTENTIAL MIGRANTS.

17:08.594 --> 17:09.728
THE MESSAGE IS QUITE CLEAR.

17:09.728 --> 17:11.563
DO NOT COME.

17:11.563 --> 17:12.297
THE BORDER IS CLOSED.

17:12.297 --> 17:15.934
THE BORDER IS SECURE.

17:15.934 --> 17:19.104
WE ARE EXPELLING FAMILIES.

17:19.104 --> 17:21.407
WE ARE EXPELLING SINGLE ADULTS

17:21.407 --> 17:25.744
UNDER THE CDC'S AUTHORITY UNDER

17:25.744 --> 17:28.213
TITLE 42 OF THE UNITED STATES

17:28.213 --> 17:29.615
CODE BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE MIDST

17:29.615 --> 17:30.783
OF A PANDEMIC, AND THAT IS A

17:30.783 --> 17:32.618
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPERATIVE.

17:32.618 --> 17:33.619
EXCEPT IT WASN'T A

17:33.619 --> 17:34.219
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPERATIVE, AND

17:34.219 --> 17:37.489
EVERYONE KNEW IT.

17:37.489 --> 17:38.357
AND LOOK, IF YOU'RE GOING TO

17:38.357 --> 17:39.558
PARROT TRUMP'S HARMFUL TALKING

17:39.558 --> 17:41.093
POINTS, AT LEAST THROW IN SOME

17:41.093 --> 17:42.628
OF THE FUNNY ONES AS WELL.

17:42.628 --> 17:43.829
EVERY TIME YOU DO A PRESS

17:43.829 --> 17:45.330
CONFERENCE TO BOLSTER SOME

17:45.330 --> 17:46.365
BULLSHIT XENOPHOBIC POLICY LIKE

17:46.365 --> 17:48.400
TITLE 42, YOU ALSO HAVE TO GO

17:48.400 --> 17:49.535
OFF ON A TANGENT ABOUT HOW

17:49.535 --> 17:50.803
ROBERT PATTINSON SHOULD HAVE

17:50.803 --> 17:52.404
DUMPED KRISTEN STEWART.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.240
IT IS THE LEAST YOU CAN DO.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.642
FOR MONTHS AFTERWARD, THE BIDEN

17:56.642 --> 17:58.177
ADMINISTRATION LET THE POLICY

17:58.177 --> 17:59.278
STAND, AND EVEN AT ONE POINT

17:59.278 --> 18:01.280
DEFENDED IT IN COURT.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.816
THEN, TO BE FAIR, THEY DID TRY

18:03.816 --> 18:04.983
TO END IT, ONLY FOR A FEDERAL

18:04.983 --> 18:06.652
JUDGE TO BLOCK THOSE EFFORTS,

18:06.652 --> 18:07.853
WITH REPORTING AT THE TIME

18:07.853 --> 18:08.987
INDICATING THE "RULING WAS MET

18:08.987 --> 18:10.389
WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF INSIDE THE

18:10.389 --> 18:11.423
WHITE HOUSE."

18:11.423 --> 18:12.424
MOREOVER, BIDEN ACTUALLY

18:12.424 --> 18:14.726
EXPANDED WHO COULD BE EXPELLED

18:14.726 --> 18:16.128
TO MEXICO UNDER TITLE 42.

18:16.128 --> 18:17.162
BECAUSE WHILE THE ORDER

18:17.162 --> 18:18.831
INITIALLY ALLOWED THE U.S. TO DO

18:18.831 --> 18:20.632
THAT WITH MIGRANTS FROM THESE

18:20.632 --> 18:22.401
FOUR COUNTRIES, HE CHOSE TO

18:22.401 --> 18:23.836
BROADEN IT, FIRST TO INCLUDE

18:23.836 --> 18:25.537
VENEZUELAN MIGRANTS, AND LATER

18:25.537 --> 18:26.905
TO THOSE FROM CUBA, HAITI, AND

18:26.905 --> 18:28.106
NICARAGUA.

18:28.106 --> 18:29.041
AND THE ADMINISTRATION WILL

18:29.041 --> 18:30.209
POINT OUT-- AND NOT WRONGLY--

18:30.209 --> 18:32.478
THAT THEY HAVE ISSUED

18:32.478 --> 18:33.445
HUMANITARIAN EXEMPTIONS TO

18:33.445 --> 18:34.179
TITLE 42.

18:34.179 --> 18:37.249
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT AROUND

18:37.249 --> 18:38.417
187,000 MIGRANTS WERE GRANTED

18:38.417 --> 18:42.855
EXEMPTIONS FROM MAY OF LAST YEAR

18:42.855 --> 18:43.288
TO JUST LAST MONTH.

18:43.288 --> 18:43.956
BUT NOT ONLY IS THAT A FRACTION

18:43.956 --> 18:45.123
OF THOSE SEEKING ASYLUM, THE

18:45.123 --> 18:46.992
ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN CRITICIZED

18:46.992 --> 18:47.526
FOR A LACK OF CLARITY AND

18:47.526 --> 18:48.327
CONSISTENCY IN WHO IS ELIGIBLE.

18:48.327 --> 18:49.962
AND IN GENERAL, SOME HAVE ARGUED

18:49.962 --> 18:51.263
THERE'S BEEN A PRETTY GLARING

18:51.263 --> 18:52.397
DISCREPANCY IN WHO THE COUNTRY

18:52.397 --> 18:54.166
HAS, AND HASN'T, DECIDED TO

18:54.166 --> 18:56.168
ALLOW IN.

18:56.168 --> 18:58.036
AT A MIGRANT SHELTER IN

18:58.036 --> 18:58.604
TIJUANA, MEXICO, CLAIMS OF A

18:58.604 --> 19:00.072
SPECIAL

19:00.072 --> 19:02.741
TREATMENT FOR UKRAINIANS FLEEING

19:02.741 --> 19:03.876
THE WAR AND BEING ADMITTED TO

19:03.876 --> 19:04.776
THE U.S.

19:04.776 --> 19:05.644
I LOVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS

19:05.644 --> 19:09.781
HELPING THEM, BECAUSE THEY--

19:09.781 --> 19:10.749
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A REALLY

19:10.749 --> 19:11.116
HARD SITUATION.

19:11.116 --> 19:11.717
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS

19:11.717 --> 19:12.084
FOR PEOPLE HERE.

19:12.084 --> 19:12.951
EXACTLY.

19:12.951 --> 19:13.519
WE SHOULD ALL BE TREATED THE

19:13.519 --> 19:14.086
SAME-- THE SAME WAY.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.621
HOW DO YOU GUYS ACCOUNT FOR

19:15.621 --> 19:16.255
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TREATMENT

19:16.255 --> 19:17.723
BETWEEN THEM AND YOU GUYS?

19:17.723 --> 19:18.590
RACISMO.

19:18.590 --> 19:19.558
RACISM.

19:19.558 --> 19:20.259
YEAH, OF COURSE.

19:20.259 --> 19:22.427
"RACISM."

19:22.427 --> 19:22.928
IS THE ANSWER TO SO MANY

19:22.928 --> 19:23.962
QUESTIONS, LIKE, "WHY ARE SOME

19:23.962 --> 19:24.863
PEOPLE TREATED DIFFERENTLY AT

19:24.863 --> 19:25.797
THE BORDER?"

19:25.797 --> 19:26.331
"WHY DID ROSEANNE BARR GET

19:26.331 --> 19:27.566
FIRED?"

19:27.566 --> 19:28.834
AND "WHY DOES YOUR GRANDPA

19:28.834 --> 19:32.104
INSIST ON PRONOUNCING "KAMALA"

19:32.104 --> 19:34.072
THE WAY HE DOES?"

19:34.072 --> 19:34.973
AND TITLE 42-- INCLUDING

19:34.973 --> 19:36.141
BIDEN'S EXPANDED USE OF IT--

19:36.141 --> 19:37.576
HAS FUNCTIONALLY ROBBED PEOPLE

19:37.576 --> 19:39.044
OF THEIR BASIC RIGHT TO MAKE AN

19:39.044 --> 19:40.212
ASYLUM CASE FOR THEMSELVES.

19:40.212 --> 19:41.914
WHICH CAN BE DEVASTATING.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.115
JUST LISTEN TO THIS HONDURAN

19:43.115 --> 19:44.483
MIGRANT TALK ABOUT GETTING ALL

19:44.483 --> 19:47.319
THE WAY TO AMERICA WITH HIS

19:47.319 --> 19:48.153
FAMILY, ON THE PRESUMPTION HE'D

19:48.153 --> 19:50.789
BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM,

19:50.789 --> 19:51.857
ONLY TO BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY,

19:51.857 --> 19:53.392
AND WOKEN UP ONE DAY WITH AN

19:53.392 --> 19:54.893
UNPLEASANT SURPRISE.

19:54.893 --> 19:56.094
ONE OF US ASKED, "WHERE ARE

19:56.094 --> 19:57.496
YOU TAKING US?

19:57.496 --> 19:58.096
IS IT TRUE WE'RE BEING

19:58.096 --> 19:59.364
DEPORTED?"

19:59.364 --> 20:00.532
THEY SAID, "NO, WE'RE NOT

20:00.532 --> 20:02.034
DEPORTING YOU.

20:02.034 --> 20:02.868
WE'RE TAKING YOU TO A SHELTER,

20:02.868 --> 20:03.802
AND YOU CAN KEEP GOING FROM

20:03.802 --> 20:05.270
THERE."

20:05.270 --> 20:06.705
AND THAT WAS A LIE.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.173
THEY TRICKED US.

20:08.173 --> 20:09.641
WHEN WE GOT OFF THE BUS, WE

20:09.641 --> 20:11.043
SAW THE SIGN THAT SAID TIJUANA,

20:11.043 --> 20:12.744
BAJA CALIFORNIA.

20:12.744 --> 20:14.246
THAT'S WHEN WE REALIZED WE'D

20:14.246 --> 20:15.614
BEEN SENT BACK.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.516
SO YOU DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL

20:17.516 --> 20:18.750
YOU WERE ALREADY IN MEXICO?

20:18.750 --> 20:19.685
RIGHT.

20:19.685 --> 20:21.320
ONCE WE WERE ALREADY HERE.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.454
LOOK, THAT'S CLEARLY

20:22.454 --> 20:23.789
NOT HOW IMMIGRATION POLICY

20:23.789 --> 20:26.258
SHOULD WORK.

20:26.258 --> 20:27.292
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD

20:27.292 --> 20:28.894
PEOPLE ON A BUS BE LIED TO ABOUT

20:28.894 --> 20:30.329
WHERE IT'S GOING, UNLESS THAT

20:30.329 --> 20:31.630
IS, IT'S A BACHELORETTE PARTY

20:31.630 --> 20:33.065
BUS AND THEY'RE DEMANDING TO BE

20:33.065 --> 20:33.999
TAKEN TO ANOTHER BAR EVEN THOUGH

20:33.999 --> 20:35.367
ONE OF THEM ALREADY THREW UP ON

20:35.367 --> 20:35.867
A PIGEON.

20:35.867 --> 20:41.273
IN THAT CASE, AND THAT CASE

20:41.273 --> 20:43.575
ALONE, YOU SAY "SURE," YOU SWING

20:43.575 --> 20:44.443
BY CVS FOR SOME PEDIALYTE, AND

20:44.443 --> 20:45.110
TAKE THEM BACK TO THEIR AIRBNB.

20:45.110 --> 20:45.844
AND BECAUSE MANY MIGRANTS CAN'T

20:45.844 --> 20:47.379
RETURN TO THE COUNTRY THAT THEY

20:47.379 --> 20:49.414
WERE FLEEING, THEY WIND UP STUCK

20:49.414 --> 20:50.082
ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER-- OR

20:50.082 --> 20:51.717
TRYING REPEATEDLY TO GET BACK

20:51.717 --> 20:52.384
INTO THE COUNTRY, OFTEN AT THEIR

20:52.384 --> 20:54.886
OWN PERIL.

20:54.886 --> 20:58.457
MORE THAN 890 MIGRANTS DIED IN

20:58.457 --> 20:59.024
BORDER CROSSINGS LAST YEAR,

20:59.024 --> 21:00.092
MAKING IT THE DEADLIEST YEAR

21:00.092 --> 21:01.326
SINCE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT BEGAN

21:01.326 --> 21:02.761
TRACKING BORDER CROSSING DEATHS.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.296
AND FOR THOSE STUCK IN MEXICO,

21:04.296 --> 21:06.031
THE EXPERIENCE CAN BE HARROWING.

21:06.031 --> 21:07.766
ONE GROUP FOUND THAT, SINCE

21:07.766 --> 21:10.535
2021, THERE'VE BEEN OVER 13,000

21:10.535 --> 21:11.403
REPORTS OF MURDER, TORTURE,

21:11.403 --> 21:13.605
KIDNAPPING, RAPE, AND OTHER

21:13.605 --> 21:15.374
VIOLENT ATTACKS ON MIGRANTS AND

21:15.374 --> 21:16.575
ASYLUM SEEKERS BLOCKED IN OR

21:16.575 --> 21:19.778
EXPELLED TO MEXICO UNDER

21:19.778 --> 21:21.680
TITLE 42.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.415
NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS, TITLE 42

21:23.415 --> 21:25.484
MAY BE ABOUT TO EXPIRE.

21:25.484 --> 21:26.718
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS, WHEN

21:26.718 --> 21:27.886
THE BROADER COVID PUBLIC HEALTH

21:27.886 --> 21:28.920
EMERGENCY ENDS ON MAY 11TH,

21:28.920 --> 21:30.155
TITLE 42 IS EXPECTED TO EXPIRE

21:30.155 --> 21:32.891
WITH IT.

21:32.891 --> 21:36.261
THE BAD NEWS THOUGH, WITH WITH

21:36.261 --> 21:42.534
OVER TWO YEARS TO PLAN, BIDEN'S

21:42.534 --> 21:43.135
NEW PROPOSED RULE MAY NOT BE

21:43.135 --> 21:43.635
MUCH OF AN IMPROVEMENT.

21:43.635 --> 21:44.236
FOR ONE THING, ASYLUM SEEKERS

21:44.236 --> 21:44.870
WILL NOW BE EXPECTED TO MAKE AN

21:44.870 --> 21:45.871
APPOINTMENT AT A POINT OF ENTRY,

21:45.871 --> 21:47.072
THROUGH A NEW GOVERNMENT APP

21:47.072 --> 21:47.706
THAT BIDEN PROUDLY ANNOUNCED IN

21:47.706 --> 21:50.342
JANUARY.

21:50.342 --> 21:51.610
IF THEY'RE SEEKING ASYLUM,

21:51.610 --> 21:55.013
THEY CAN USE AN APP ON THEIR

21:55.013 --> 21:57.249
CELL PHONE CALLED CBP ONE--

21:57.249 --> 21:57.783
O-N-E.

21:57.783 --> 22:00.919
CBP ONE O-N-E.

22:00.919 --> 22:01.820
THAT'S TO SPELL IT OUT, NOT THE

22:01.820 --> 22:03.989
NUMBER ONE.

22:03.989 --> 22:04.690
THANKS FOR SPELLING IT

22:04.690 --> 22:05.190
OUT!

22:05.190 --> 22:09.227
THAT HELPS A GREAT DEAL.

22:09.227 --> 22:09.995
THIS IS THAT APP, AND AS YOU CAN

22:09.995 --> 22:10.495
SEE, ITS ICON APPARENTLY

22:10.495 --> 22:12.130
FEATURES-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT

22:12.130 --> 22:12.731
ELSE THIS COULD BE-- A BORDER

22:12.731 --> 22:13.265
PATROL AGENT WITH A RAGING

22:13.265 --> 22:16.768
BONER.

22:16.768 --> 22:18.403
IT HAS BEEN IN USE SINCE

22:18.403 --> 22:20.439
JANUARY, AS A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO

22:20.439 --> 22:22.274
REQUEST EXEMPTIONS TO TITLE 42,

22:22.274 --> 22:24.743
AND THE EARLY RESULTS AREN'T

22:24.743 --> 22:25.110
GREAT.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.212
EVERY MORNING AT 9 AM, WOMEN

22:27.212 --> 22:28.313
FRANTICALLY TRY TO REFRESH THE

22:28.313 --> 22:31.083
GOVERNMENT APP HOPING TO GET AN

22:31.083 --> 22:33.285
APPOINTMENT TO ENTER THE U.S.

22:33.285 --> 22:34.453
WE WATCHED WITH KARINA BRECEDA

22:34.453 --> 22:36.688
WHO RUNS THE SHELTER.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.757
BY 9:05, ALL THE APPOINTMENTS,

22:38.757 --> 22:41.226
AND HOPE, WERE GONE.

22:41.226 --> 22:43.829
IT'S LOTTERY WITH PEOPLE'S

22:43.829 --> 22:44.696
LIVES, WITH PEOPLE'S FAMILIES,

22:44.696 --> 22:45.997
WITH PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS, WITH

22:45.997 --> 22:48.467
PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING.

22:48.467 --> 22:49.367
THAT IS HORRIBLE.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.436
WE CLEARLY SHOULDN'T BE PLACING

22:51.436 --> 22:52.637
PEOPLES' FATE IN THE HANDS OF A

22:52.637 --> 22:53.672
SMARTPHONE APP.

22:53.672 --> 22:54.539
AND DON'T GET ME WRONG, APPS CAN

22:54.539 --> 22:56.675
SERVE A LOT OF FUNCTIONS.

22:56.675 --> 22:57.309
FOR EXAMPLE, THIS ONE'S FOR

22:57.309 --> 22:59.911
MESSAGING YOUR FRIENDS, THIS

22:59.911 --> 23:00.812
ONE'S FOR RECEIVING ROBOCALLS,

23:00.812 --> 23:01.847
THIS ONE'S FOR SEEING WHAT YOUR

23:01.847 --> 23:03.849
MOM IS UP TO, THIS ONE'S FOR

23:03.849 --> 23:04.449
ACCIDENTALLY TURNING IT ON,

23:04.449 --> 23:05.584
MUTTERING "SHIT," AND FINALLY

23:05.584 --> 23:08.587
TURNING IT OFF AFTER A MINIMUM

23:08.587 --> 23:10.088
OF THREE TRIES, THIS ONE'S FOR

23:10.088 --> 23:10.856
WATCHING DEMOCRACY CRUMBLE WHILE

23:10.856 --> 23:11.923
CHER TWEETS THE MOST BAFFLING

23:11.923 --> 23:14.159
SERIES OF EMOJIS YOU'VE EVER

23:14.159 --> 23:15.527
SEEN, AND THIS ONE'S FOR LOOKING

23:15.527 --> 23:16.895
AT PHOTOS OF PUGS WHO MAKE A

23:16.895 --> 23:18.930
BETTER LIVING THAN YOU DO.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.332
THE POINT HERE IS, WE USE APPS

23:20.332 --> 23:21.066
FOR MANY PURPOSES, BUT

23:21.066 --> 23:25.537
"RESERVING AN APPOINTMENT TO TRY

23:25.537 --> 23:26.338
TO SECURE THE SAFETY OF YOUR

23:26.338 --> 23:26.938
FAMILY" PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE

23:26.938 --> 23:27.372
ONE OF THEM.

23:27.372 --> 23:28.974
AS OF RIGHT NOW, ONLY ABOUT 740

23:28.974 --> 23:31.943
PEOPLE PER DAY CAN GET

23:31.943 --> 23:33.078
APPOINTMENTS THROUGH THE APP.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.012
BUT SINCE THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY

23:34.012 --> 23:35.914
FAR MORE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM,

23:35.914 --> 23:36.882
A DAY'S APPOINTMENTS CAN RUN OUT

23:36.882 --> 23:38.216
WITHIN MINUTES, WHICH IS WHY

23:38.216 --> 23:40.385
SOME HAVE DUBBED THE APP "ASYLUM

23:40.385 --> 23:42.220
TICKETMASTER"-- A TRULY

23:42.220 --> 23:43.855
TERRIFYING COMBINATION OF WORDS.

23:43.855 --> 23:45.390
AND JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO

23:45.390 --> 23:48.627
APPRECIATE HOW SHITTY OF A

23:48.627 --> 23:51.396
COMPANY TICKETMASTER IS.

23:51.396 --> 23:52.230
PEOPLE SAW VULNERABLE MIGRANTS

23:52.230 --> 23:53.365
BEING ROBBED OF THEIR ABILITY TO

23:53.365 --> 23:54.633
SEEK ASYLUM AND THOUGHT, "HEY,

23:54.633 --> 23:56.067
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS REMINDS ME

23:56.067 --> 23:56.668
OF?

23:56.668 --> 23:58.637
TICKETMASTER, A COMPANY ABOUT

23:58.637 --> 24:00.739
CONCERTS."

24:00.739 --> 24:01.439
WHAT'S MORE, MANY ASYLUM SEEKERS

24:01.439 --> 24:03.542
HAVE OUTDATED CELLPHONES-- IF

24:03.542 --> 24:05.610
THEY HAVE THEM AT ALL-- THAT

24:05.610 --> 24:07.012
DON'T SUPPORT THE CBP ONE APP

24:07.012 --> 24:08.013
AND OFTEN HAVE LIMITED OR NO

24:08.013 --> 24:11.416
ACCESS TO THE INTERNET.

24:11.416 --> 24:12.117
AND ON TOP OF ALL THIS, IT

24:12.117 --> 24:12.918
REQUIRES PEOPLE TO UPLOAD A

24:12.918 --> 24:13.285
SELFIE.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.319
AND ITS FACIAL RECOGNITION

24:14.319 --> 24:15.854
TECHNOLOGY HAS WORKED BETTER FOR

24:15.854 --> 24:18.256
SOME THAN FOR OTHERS.

24:18.256 --> 24:19.491
EVEN FOR DIGITALLY SAVVY

24:19.491 --> 24:20.325
MIGRANTS, THE EXPERIENCE HAS

24:20.325 --> 24:22.894
BEEN A CHALLENGE.

24:22.894 --> 24:24.162
IT DOESN'T WANT TO SCAN.

24:24.162 --> 24:26.464
IT DOESN'T WANT TO SCAN HIS

24:26.464 --> 24:26.665
FACE.

24:26.665 --> 24:27.966
THEY SAY THE APP HAS

24:27.966 --> 24:29.668
GLITCHES, AND SOME EVEN CLAIM

24:29.668 --> 24:31.203
THE FACIAL-RECOGNITION FEATURE

24:31.203 --> 24:32.337
MALFUNCTIONS FOR THOSE WITH

24:32.337 --> 24:34.072
DARKER SKIN.

24:34.072 --> 24:35.473
I GET UP TO THE OPTION TO

24:35.473 --> 24:36.942
SCAN MY FACE, BUT IT ASKS TO GET

24:36.942 --> 24:38.243
CLOSER AND CLOSER, BUT IT

24:38.243 --> 24:40.045
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

24:40.045 --> 24:41.012
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM, THAT IT

24:41.012 --> 24:42.214
TAKES A LONG TIME TO LOAD AND

24:42.214 --> 24:42.814
THAT'S WHERE IT FAILS.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.416
SO WE TRY IT AGAIN.

24:44.416 --> 24:47.385
YEAH, PRETTY BAD.

24:47.385 --> 24:48.019
AT ONE SHELTER IN REYNOSA, THEY

24:48.019 --> 24:49.955
EVEN HAD TO INSTALL BRIGHT

24:49.955 --> 24:50.555
CONSTRUCTION LIGHTS FOR PEOPLE

24:50.555 --> 24:51.890
WITH DARKER SKIN TO SHINE ON

24:51.890 --> 24:52.524
THEIR FACES SO THE APP WOULD

24:52.524 --> 24:54.926
RECOGNIZE THEM.

24:54.926 --> 24:56.995
AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, GIVEN THE

24:56.995 --> 24:58.096
HISTORY OF EVERYTHING THAT'S

24:58.096 --> 24:58.697
HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY EVER,

24:58.697 --> 24:59.598
IT'S HARD TO THINK OF ANYTHING

24:59.598 --> 25:01.166
MORE ON-BRAND THAN A U.S.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.001
IMMIGRATION APP THAT SCANS YOUR

25:03.001 --> 25:04.236
FACE AND SAYS "NOT WHITE

25:04.236 --> 25:06.538
ENOUGH."

25:06.538 --> 25:08.073
AND NONE OF THIS IS EVEN GETTING

25:08.073 --> 25:09.241
INTO SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES

25:09.241 --> 25:10.508
WITH THE APP, LIKE THAT IT'S

25:10.508 --> 25:12.010
TOLD MIGRANTS TO REPORT TO

25:12.010 --> 25:13.511
BORDER STATIONS 1,500 MILES

25:13.511 --> 25:15.213
AWAY, AND HAS MADE IT VERY

25:15.213 --> 25:16.882
DIFFICULT FOR FAMILIES TO GET

25:16.882 --> 25:17.782
APPOINTMENTS TOGETHER.

25:17.782 --> 25:18.450
AND FOR ANYONE CONSIDERING

25:18.450 --> 25:22.621
TRYING TO CIRCUMVENT THE PROCESS

25:22.621 --> 25:23.521
BY CROSSING THE BORDER BETWEEN

25:23.521 --> 25:25.824
PORTS OF ENTRY TO REQUEST ASYLUM

25:25.824 --> 25:27.425
SOMETHING THAT, AGAIN, IS

25:27.425 --> 25:29.527
COMPLETELY LEGAL-- UNDER

25:29.527 --> 25:30.195
BIDEN'S PROPOSAL YOU WOULD BE

25:30.195 --> 25:30.695
"PRESUMED INELIGIBLE FOR

25:30.695 --> 25:32.364
ASYLUM," UNLESS YOU'VE ALREADY

25:32.364 --> 25:34.666
APPLIED FOR IT, AND BEEN DENIED,

25:34.666 --> 25:35.634
IN ANY COUNTRY THAT YOU'VE

25:35.634 --> 25:36.434
ALREADY PASSED THROUGH.

25:36.434 --> 25:37.969
AND AS MANY HAVE POINTED OUT,

25:37.969 --> 25:38.970
THIS IS EERILY SIMILAR TO A

25:38.970 --> 25:41.106
TRUMP ERA POLICY THAT MADE

25:41.106 --> 25:42.107
MIGRANTS INELIGIBLE FOR ASYLUM

25:42.107 --> 25:44.075
IF THEY PASSED THROUGH A THIRD

25:44.075 --> 25:45.310
COUNTRY EN ROUTE TO THE U.S. AND

25:45.310 --> 25:48.079
DIDN'T SEEK ASYLUM THERE FIRST.

25:48.079 --> 25:49.281
THAT FORCED PEOPLE INTO

25:49.281 --> 25:50.815
DANGEROUS SITUATIONS, AND WAS

25:50.815 --> 25:51.816
COMPLETELY ANTITHETICAL TO THE

25:51.816 --> 25:53.585
BASIC TENETS OF U.S. ASYLUM

25:53.585 --> 25:54.853
POLICY.

25:54.853 --> 25:57.789
AND THAT IS SOMETHING BIDEN

25:57.789 --> 25:59.391
HIMSELF DEFINITELY USED TO

25:59.391 --> 26:00.592
UNDERSTAND, GIVEN, REMEMBER,

26:00.592 --> 26:01.359
HE'S THE GUY WHO SAID THIS.

26:01.359 --> 26:02.193
CAN'T EVEN SEEK ASYLUM ON

26:02.193 --> 26:03.628
AMERICAN SOIL?

26:03.628 --> 26:06.131
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

26:06.131 --> 26:11.603
OH I CAN ANSWER THAT

26:11.603 --> 26:11.937
FOR YOU, JOE!

26:11.937 --> 26:12.270
NOW!

26:12.270 --> 26:12.771
IT'S IN A RULE YOU JUST

26:12.771 --> 26:15.240
PROPOSED!

26:15.240 --> 26:15.840
AND I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF

26:15.840 --> 26:16.474
THINGS WE'D LIKE TO FORGET FROM

26:16.474 --> 26:17.108
2020, LIKE THE WORD CUOMOSEXUAL,

26:17.108 --> 26:18.109
OR HOW EVERYTHING WAS CAKE FOR A

26:18.109 --> 26:20.879
WHILE, OR HOW GONZO MY HAIR GOT,

26:20.879 --> 26:22.714
I LOOK LIKE I LEGALLY HAVE TO

26:22.714 --> 26:24.249
TELL EVERY ONE I JUST MOVED INTO

26:24.249 --> 26:25.784
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

26:25.784 --> 26:28.253
BUT YOUR OUTRAGE OF THE

26:28.253 --> 26:28.820
TREATMENT OF ASYLUM SEEKERS

26:28.820 --> 26:29.688
SHOULDN'T BE SOMETHING YOU'RE

26:29.688 --> 26:32.590
ALLOWED TO JUST FORGET.

26:32.590 --> 26:33.224
SO IF AND WHEN TITLE 42 EXPIRES

26:33.224 --> 26:34.626
NEXT MONTH, IT SEEMS WE'RE NOT

26:34.626 --> 26:38.563
GOING BACK TO THE WAY THINGS

26:38.563 --> 26:39.097
WERE BEFORE TRUMP.

26:39.097 --> 26:44.336
WITH BIDEN'S NEW PROPOSAL, WE'RE

26:44.336 --> 26:44.970
JUST ENTERING A DIFFERENT PHASE

26:44.970 --> 26:45.537
OF AN IMMIGRATION DYSTOPIA,

26:45.537 --> 26:46.171
PARTICULARLY FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS.

26:46.171 --> 26:47.138
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY

26:47.138 --> 26:47.372
WITH IT.

26:47.372 --> 26:47.973
THE U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR

26:47.973 --> 26:48.440
REFUGEES HAS SAID IT'S

26:48.440 --> 26:48.907
"INCONSISTENT WITH THE

26:48.907 --> 26:51.776
FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF

26:51.776 --> 26:53.545
INTERNATIONAL REFUGEE LAW" AND

26:53.545 --> 26:54.779
RECOMMENDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT

26:54.779 --> 26:56.548
REFRAIN FROM ADOPTING IT.

26:56.548 --> 26:59.451
LOOK, IT IS PRETTY OBVIOUS

26:59.451 --> 27:00.085
TITLE 42 WAS NEVER A FUNCTIONAL

27:00.085 --> 27:01.720
OR COMPASSIONATE MODEL OF

27:01.720 --> 27:04.322
IMMIGRATION POLICY.

27:04.322 --> 27:05.423
BUT NEITHER IS FUNNELING

27:05.423 --> 27:07.092
MIGRANTS THROUGH AN APP WHOSE

27:07.092 --> 27:08.193
BONER ICON ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE

27:08.193 --> 27:10.495
NOW, GIVEN JUST HOW THOROUGHLY

27:10.495 --> 27:11.830
IT FUCKS PEOPLE.

27:11.830 --> 27:12.764
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

27:12.764 --> 27:14.566
WELL, RESTORING THE RIGHT TO

27:14.566 --> 27:15.200
ASYLUM WOULD ROLL BACK AT LEAST

27:15.200 --> 27:16.067
SOME OF THE HARM THAT'S BEEN

27:16.067 --> 27:17.669
DONE HERE.

27:17.669 --> 27:19.070
BUT THAT IS JUST THE START.

27:19.070 --> 27:20.638
WE ALSO HAVE TO SCALE UP

27:20.638 --> 27:22.073
CAPACITY OF OUR ENTIRE

27:22.073 --> 27:23.241
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, INCLUDING

27:23.241 --> 27:24.309
OUR IMMIGRATION COURTS, WHICH,

27:24.309 --> 27:25.643
AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THE

27:25.643 --> 27:26.177
SHOW BEFORE, ARE MASSIVELY

27:26.177 --> 27:27.946
OVERLOADED.

27:27.946 --> 27:29.080
THEY'RE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO

27:29.080 --> 27:30.749
HAVE A BACKLOG OF OVER 2 MILLION

27:30.749 --> 27:32.517
CASES.

27:32.517 --> 27:36.421
AND BEYOND THAT, IT IS CRITICAL

27:36.421 --> 27:37.255
THAT WE ALSO EXPAND OTHER LEGAL,

27:37.255 --> 27:37.956
NON-ASYLUM PATHWAYS INTO THIS

27:37.956 --> 27:39.357
COUNTRY.

27:39.357 --> 27:41.726
BASICALLY, WE BADLY NEED ACTUAL

27:41.726 --> 27:42.794
IMMIGRATION REFORM, WHICH MEANS

27:42.794 --> 27:45.130
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION.

27:45.130 --> 27:45.897
BUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IN

27:45.897 --> 27:46.264
DECADES.

27:46.264 --> 27:46.965
AND UNTIL IT DOES, OUR

27:46.965 --> 27:47.932
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WILL REMAIN

27:47.932 --> 27:50.435
FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN.

27:50.435 --> 27:51.870
BUT THAT'S NO EXCUSE FOR MAKING

27:51.870 --> 27:54.072
THINGS EVEN WORSE WITH BAD

27:54.072 --> 27:55.673
POLICY AND SHITTY APPS.

27:55.673 --> 27:56.875
AND I KNOW THIS CAN BE HARD TO

27:56.875 --> 27:59.010
HEAR FOR SOME DEMOCRATS, WHO ARE

27:59.010 --> 28:00.512
RELUCTANT TO HEAR ANY CRITICISM

28:00.512 --> 28:01.046
OF BIDEN.

28:01.046 --> 28:02.480
THEY'LL POINT OUT THAT TRUMP WAS

28:02.480 --> 28:04.382
ABSOLUTELY WORSE ON IMMIGRATION,

28:04.382 --> 28:07.685
WHICH HE WAS.

28:07.685 --> 28:12.724
BUT THAT'S TOO LOW A BAR.

28:12.724 --> 28:13.358
BIDEN SHOULD, AT THE VERY LEAST,

28:13.358 --> 28:13.925
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE

28:13.925 --> 28:15.393
PROMISES HE MADE.

28:15.393 --> 28:16.161
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, WHEN IT

28:16.161 --> 28:16.995
COMES TO ASYLUM SEEKERS IN

28:16.995 --> 28:18.229
PARTICULAR, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

28:18.229 --> 28:19.764
A GROUP OF PEOPLE FOR WHOM THOSE

28:19.764 --> 28:20.365
PROMISES ARE AMONG THE EASIEST

28:20.365 --> 28:22.500
TO BREAK.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.435
AND THE FACT IS, MIGRANTS ARE

28:23.435 --> 28:25.036
GOING TO KEEP SEEKING ASYLUM IN

28:25.036 --> 28:26.271
THIS COUNTRY, AS THEY HAVE EVERY

28:26.271 --> 28:28.073
LEGAL RIGHT TO DO.

28:28.073 --> 28:28.807
AND WE NEED TO MAKE A CHOICE IN

28:28.807 --> 28:30.809
WHETHER WE'RE COMFORTABLE TO

28:30.809 --> 28:32.577
CONTINUE LEAVING SO MANY OF THEM

28:32.577 --> 28:33.711
IN SQUALOR AND DANGER AT THE

28:33.711 --> 28:36.314
BORDER, OR WHETHER WE'RE WILLING

28:36.314 --> 28:38.917
TO FINALLY FULFILL OUR NATION'S

28:38.917 --> 28:39.617
PROMISE OF OFFERING THEM A

28:39.617 --> 28:41.219
SAFER, MORE HOPEFUL LIFE IN A

28:41.219 --> 28:47.158
FREE COUNTRY COMPLETE WITH THE

28:47.158 --> 28:49.994
HORNIEST PILE O' GATORS IN THE

28:49.994 --> 28:50.395
ENTIRE WORLD.

28:50.395 --> 28:59.504
AND NOW THIS.

28:59.504 --> 29:00.138
AND NOW, WAIT, DID

29:00.138 --> 29:00.705
TUCKER CARLSON KNOW THIS WAS

29:00.705 --> 29:00.939
COMING?

29:00.939 --> 29:01.506
PEOPLE GETTING HIRED AND

29:01.506 --> 29:02.140
DROVE OUT OF SOCIETY FORCING THE

29:02.140 --> 29:02.440
WRONG THING.

29:02.440 --> 29:02.841
EVEN ACCIDENTALLY.

29:02.841 --> 29:04.976
SO PAY ATTENTION.

29:04.976 --> 29:06.611
LET ME JUST BE TOTALLY CLEAR,

29:06.611 --> 29:07.712
I'M NEVER GOING TO CALL FOR

29:07.712 --> 29:08.847
ANYBODY'S FIRING FOR SAYING

29:08.847 --> 29:10.148
SOMETHING STUPID ON TELEVISION

29:10.148 --> 29:11.316
AS SOMEONE WHO SAID SOMETHING

29:11.316 --> 29:14.686
STUPID ON TELEVISION.

29:14.686 --> 29:15.854
OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT DISAGREE WITH

29:15.854 --> 29:16.287
YOU AND THAT'S OKAY.

29:16.287 --> 29:17.755
THAT DOESN'T MAKE OTHER VIEW

29:17.755 --> 29:18.323
EVIL OR SHOULD BE FIRED FROM

29:18.323 --> 29:22.760
YOUR JOB.

29:22.760 --> 29:23.495
I'D BE HAPPY TO LIVE IN A WORLD

29:23.495 --> 29:24.462
WHERE NOBODY GOT FIRED FOR

29:24.462 --> 29:25.096
SAYING SOMETHING STUPID.

29:25.096 --> 29:25.797
WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE BEING

29:25.797 --> 29:26.698
FIRED RIGHT NOW?

29:26.698 --> 29:28.299
YOU CAN BE FIRED FROM YOUR JOB

29:28.299 --> 29:35.106
IF YOU DISOBEY.

29:35.106 --> 29:35.907
DO YOU EVER SAY ANYTHING YOU

29:35.907 --> 29:36.441
THINK AT WORK AND YOU CAN

29:36.441 --> 29:36.741
BE FIRED.

29:36.741 --> 29:38.877
YOU CAN BE FIRED.

29:38.877 --> 29:39.611
MOST OF US DON'T HAVE JOB

29:39.611 --> 29:43.515
SECURITY, I'VE BEEN FIRED.

29:43.515 --> 29:44.082
PERHAPS I'LL BE FIRED AGAIN.

29:51.156 --> 29:52.123
MOVING ON.

29:52.123 --> 29:52.790
BEFORE WE GO TONIGHT, A QUICK

29:52.790 --> 29:53.191
UPDATE.

29:53.191 --> 29:54.659
YOU MAY REMEMBER LAST MONTH, WE

29:54.659 --> 29:55.560
INTRODUCED YOU TO RADIANT

29:55.560 --> 29:56.828
PLUMBING AND AIR CONDITIONING, A

29:56.828 --> 29:58.163
TEXAS COMPANY STARTED BY A

29:58.163 --> 30:00.165
MARRIED COUPLE WHO PRODUCE

30:00.165 --> 30:01.666
ELABORATE MOVIE-THEMED ADS, FROM

30:01.666 --> 30:08.573
A TOILET-THEMED AVENGERS PARODY,

30:08.573 --> 30:10.341
TO A TOILET THEMED TERMINATOR

30:10.341 --> 30:10.942
ONE, TO EVEN TAKING ON "DUNE".

30:10.942 --> 30:11.543
THE PEOPLE ASK US TO BRING

30:11.543 --> 30:12.177
PEACE TO THE CITY OF AUSTIN.

30:12.177 --> 30:14.646
HOUSE RADIANT ACCEPTS!

30:14.646 --> 30:17.115
I KNOW YOU.

30:17.115 --> 30:19.484
THERE'S SOMETHING AWAKENING IN

30:19.484 --> 30:24.489
YOUR MIND.

30:25.590 --> 30:26.891
YOU KNOW, WHEN

30:26.891 --> 30:28.259
FRANK HERBERT WROTE "DUNE," I

30:28.259 --> 30:29.661
DOUBT HE REALIZED THAT THE

30:29.661 --> 30:31.930
QUINTESSENTIAL VERSION OF HIS

30:31.930 --> 30:32.564
STORY WOULD BE MADE NOT BY

30:32.564 --> 30:33.932
JODOROWSKY, NOT BY DAVID LYNCH,

30:33.932 --> 30:35.733
NOT BY DENIS VILLENEUVE, BUT BY

30:35.733 --> 30:37.869
A GAGGLE OF TEXAS TOILET

30:37.869 --> 30:38.403
SPECIALISTS WITH AN AFTER

30:38.403 --> 30:40.538
EFFECTS LOGIN.

30:40.538 --> 30:41.406
WE LOVED THEIR INGENUITY SO

30:41.406 --> 30:42.607
MUCH, WE ISSUED THEM A

30:42.607 --> 30:44.142
CHALLENGE, SAYING, IF THEY

30:44.142 --> 30:45.410
AGREED TO MAKE THEIR NEXT

30:45.410 --> 30:47.212
COMMERCIAL BASED ON THE MYSTERY

30:47.212 --> 30:49.047
MOVIE IN THAT ENVELOPE, WE'D

30:49.047 --> 30:51.416
DEBUT IT ON THIS SHOW, AND GIVE

30:51.416 --> 30:52.383
$10,000 TO THE CENTRAL TEXAS

30:52.383 --> 30:53.251
FOOD BANK.

30:53.251 --> 30:56.020
AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THEY TOOK

30:56.020 --> 30:57.322
US UP ON THAT OFFER.

30:57.322 --> 30:59.624
AND LOOK, WE WERE NEVER GOING TO

30:59.624 --> 31:04.262
FUCK THEM OVER WITH THE MOVIE

31:04.262 --> 31:04.896
CHOICE, WE WERE NEVER GOING TO

31:04.896 --> 31:09.400
FUCK THEM OVER BY GIVING THEM A

31:09.400 --> 31:10.068
MOVIE LIKE "SCHINDLER'S LIST" OR

31:10.068 --> 31:11.269
"TAR."

31:11.269 --> 31:11.903
BUT WE WANTED TO CHALLENGE THEM.

31:11.903 --> 31:12.437
SO THE FILM WE PICKED WAS

31:12.437 --> 31:12.804
"MAGNOLIA."

31:12.804 --> 31:13.638
THAT'S RIGHT, WE ASKED THEM TO

31:13.638 --> 31:14.639
TURN P.T. ANDERSON'S SPRAWLING,

31:14.639 --> 31:16.507
THREE-HOUR EPIC INTO A

31:16.507 --> 31:17.108
COMMERCIAL FOR A TOILET-REPAIR

31:17.108 --> 31:17.742
BUSINESS.

31:17.742 --> 31:19.410
WHICH IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

31:19.410 --> 31:20.545
"MAGNOLIA" IS A MOVIE WITH A

31:20.545 --> 31:22.814
SHIT-TON OF MAIN CHARACTERS,

31:22.814 --> 31:24.382
RANGING FROM A DERANGED

31:24.382 --> 31:27.752
MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER TO A

31:27.752 --> 31:29.721
STUCK ON A QUIZ SHOW TO A WOMAN

31:29.721 --> 31:32.724
SO HYPED OUT ON COCAINE SHE

31:32.724 --> 31:34.759
MIGHT EXPLODE TO THE COP WHO

31:34.759 --> 31:35.326
COMES TO HER DOOR AND MAYBE

31:35.326 --> 31:36.794
FALLS IN LOVE WITH HER.

31:36.794 --> 31:37.395
IT ALSO FEATURES NOT ONE, BUT

31:37.395 --> 31:38.229
TWO FATHER FIGURES DYING OF

31:38.229 --> 31:39.430
CANCER, AND CATCHY LINES OF

31:39.430 --> 31:40.565
DIALOGUE LIKE THIS.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.934
I HAVE CANCER AND I'M DYING

31:42.934 --> 31:45.803
VERY SOON.

31:45.803 --> 31:47.872
IT'S METASTASIZED IN MY BONES.

31:47.872 --> 31:49.140
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING

31:49.140 --> 31:50.275
THAT THIS FILM WAS EASY FOR THEM

31:50.275 --> 31:51.509
TO TURN INTO A TOILET PARODY.

31:51.509 --> 31:53.778
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT.

31:53.778 --> 31:55.213
BUT WE WERE CONFIDENT THEY COULD

31:55.213 --> 31:55.546
DO IT.

31:55.546 --> 31:57.882
ALSO, VISUALLY, MAGNOLIA GIVES

31:57.882 --> 31:58.983
THEM SOMETHING TO WORK WITH.

31:58.983 --> 32:00.218
IT HAS A BLACK-AND-WHITE

32:00.218 --> 32:02.420
PROLOGUE, A LITERAL RAINSTORM OF

32:02.420 --> 32:04.188
FROGS, AND A MOMENT WHERE EVERY

32:04.188 --> 32:04.789
CHARACTER SINGS THE SAME

32:04.789 --> 32:06.624
AIMEE MANN SONG.

32:06.624 --> 32:34.886
♪ IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP ♪

32:34.886 --> 32:35.420
♪ 'TIL YOU WISE UP ♪

32:35.420 --> 32:36.020
I'M TELLING YOU, THIS

32:36.020 --> 32:36.387
MOVIE IS GREAT.

32:36.387 --> 32:36.988
IT'S IS FANTASTICALLY BONKERS.

32:36.988 --> 32:37.655
SO WE WERE EXCITED TO SEE WHICH

32:37.655 --> 32:38.423
PARTS OF IT THEY CHOSE TO PARODY

32:38.423 --> 32:39.357
AND SURPRISINGLY, IT TURNED OUT:

32:39.357 --> 32:41.392
KIND OF ALL OF THEM.

32:41.392 --> 32:43.061
SO WE'RE THRILLED TO SHARE WHAT

32:43.061 --> 32:46.164
RADIANT DID WITH YOU TONIGHT.

32:46.164 --> 32:48.032
AND SPOILER ALERT, THEY REALLY

32:48.032 --> 32:49.233
OUTDID THEMSELVES WITH THE

32:49.233 --> 32:49.567
TITLE.

32:49.567 --> 32:51.502
THE YEAR WAS 1999.

32:51.502 --> 32:53.171
A TYPICAL STORY, A NORMAL COUPLE

32:53.171 --> 32:55.440
AND A NORMAL BUSINESS.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.908
WHAT THEY BUILT TURNED OUT TO BE

32:56.908 --> 33:03.147
ANYTHING BUT NORMAL.

33:03.748 --> 33:04.949
THE QUESTION IS, IF YOU HAVE

33:04.949 --> 33:05.850
PROBLEMS WITH YOUR TOILET--

33:05.850 --> 33:06.918
THE ANSWER IS, JUST CALL

33:06.918 --> 33:08.286
RADIANT.

33:08.786 --> 33:11.222

33:13.725 --> 33:15.360
I'M HERE TO HELP.

33:15.360 --> 33:16.661
SOMETIMES MY PLUMBING IS

33:16.661 --> 33:17.328
BROKEN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

33:17.328 --> 33:18.062
DO.

33:18.062 --> 33:18.696
PROBLEMS WITH YOUR PLUMBING?

33:18.996 --> 33:20.398
JUST CALL RADIANT!

33:20.398 --> 33:21.499
TELL HIM I'M OKAY.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.301
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

33:23.301 --> 33:24.802
HOW DARE YOU JUDGE ME?

33:24.802 --> 33:26.003
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE WATER

33:26.003 --> 33:27.271
HEATER!

33:27.271 --> 33:28.272
COLD SHOWERS MY WHOLE LIFE!

33:28.272 --> 33:28.873

JUST CALL RADIANT!

33:31.309 --> 33:32.443

33:39.550 --> 33:40.985
THIS DARN AC!

34:02.206 --> 34:03.708
THERE WAS THE STORY OF RADIANT

34:03.708 --> 34:05.309
PLUMBING AND AIR CONDITIONING.

34:05.309 --> 34:06.544
COULD IT ACTUALLY ALL HAVE BEEN

34:06.544 --> 34:08.913
A COINCIDENCE?

34:08.913 --> 34:11.215
ALL THIS HOUSE KNOWS FOR SURE IS

34:11.215 --> 34:13.484
THAT IF YOU NEED HELP WITH YOUR

34:13.484 --> 34:14.919

BUT HERE'S THE THING, JUST LIKE

34:35.339 --> 34:36.574
MAGNOLIA ITSELF, THAT AD'S A

34:36.574 --> 34:37.775
PIECE OF ART THAT REQUIRES

34:37.775 --> 34:39.043
MULTIPLE VIEWINGS TO TRULY

34:39.043 --> 34:39.911
APPRECIATE.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.479
BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL HERE

34:41.479 --> 34:43.714
IS COMPLETE MADNESS.

34:43.714 --> 34:45.249
THERE ARE MULTIPLE SCENES THAT

34:45.249 --> 34:46.918
ARE SHOT-FOR-SHOT MATCHES FOR

34:46.918 --> 34:48.319
THE ORIGINAL MOVIE, EVEN DOWN TO

34:48.319 --> 34:50.555
THIS ZOOM IN ON A PIECE OF ART

34:50.555 --> 34:51.689
IN "MAGNOLIA," WHICH THEY

34:51.689 --> 34:54.091
CLEVERLY MATCHED WITH THIS ONE.

34:54.091 --> 34:55.760
ALSO, IN THE ORIGINAL MOVIE, A

34:55.760 --> 34:57.628
FALLING FROG INTERRUPTS A

34:57.628 --> 34:59.497
SUICIDE ATTEMPT, AND IN THEIR

34:59.497 --> 35:00.364
VERSION, A TOILET'S SUICIDE BY

35:00.364 --> 35:02.166
DRILL IS THWARTED BY A TINY

35:02.166 --> 35:04.402
FALLING TOILET.

35:04.402 --> 35:06.103
THAT SUICIDAL TOILET, BY THE

35:06.103 --> 35:07.805
WAY, BEARS THE WORDS, "I HAVE

35:07.805 --> 35:09.273
CORROSION, IT IS IN MY

35:09.273 --> 35:10.942
PORCELAIN, ONLY HAVE A COUPLE OF

35:10.942 --> 35:12.510
MONTHS," WHILE THE OTHER DYING

35:12.510 --> 35:13.411
FATHER FIGURE IS REPRESENTED BY

35:13.411 --> 35:14.679
THIS WATER HEATER WEARING A

35:14.679 --> 35:17.348
HOSPITAL GOWN WHICH BEARS THE

35:17.348 --> 35:18.549
WORDS, "I HAVE CORROSION TOO,"

35:18.549 --> 35:20.818
SAD FACE.

35:20.818 --> 35:22.386
EVERY DETAIL IS DELIBERATE, EVEN

35:22.386 --> 35:24.622
THE THERMOSTAT IN THIS SCENE IS

35:24.622 --> 35:25.456
SET TO 99 DEGREES, REFERENCING

35:25.456 --> 35:27.925
BOTH THE YEAR THE ORIGINAL FILM

35:27.925 --> 35:29.126
WAS RELEASED AND THE YEAR THAT

35:29.126 --> 35:30.294
RADIANT WAS FOUNDED.

35:30.294 --> 35:32.029
THERE ARE MORE EASTER EGGS IN

35:32.029 --> 35:33.064
THIS AD THAN IN A 10-EPISODE

35:33.064 --> 35:35.500
MARVEL TV SHOW.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.634
AT ONE POINT IN THE ORIGINAL

35:36.634 --> 35:43.074
MOVIE, THIS CHARACTER SAYS TO

35:43.074 --> 35:46.043
THIS CHARACTER THAT HE WILL

35:46.043 --> 35:48.713
"DROPKICK THE DOGS IF THEY GET

35:48.713 --> 35:50.147
NEAR ME," AND IF YOU WATCH VERY

35:50.147 --> 35:52.817
CAREFULLY WHEN THEIR CHARACTERS

35:52.817 --> 35:53.985
MEET IN THE RADIANT AD, YOU'LL

35:53.985 --> 35:54.352
NOTICE THIS.

35:54.719 --> 35:55.486
COME ON!

35:55.486 --> 35:56.120
COME ON!

35:56.120 --> 35:56.687
WHAT ELSE COULD YOU POSSIBLY

35:56.687 --> 35:57.321
WANT?

35:57.321 --> 35:57.955
NOT ONLY DID THEY GO ABOVE AND

35:57.955 --> 35:59.457
BEYOND, THEY'RE EVEN MATCHING

35:59.457 --> 36:00.858
OUR DONATION WITH ONE TO THE

36:00.858 --> 36:03.127
SAN ANTONIO FOOD BANK.

36:03.127 --> 36:03.661
RADIANT PLUMBING, YOU HAVE

36:03.661 --> 36:05.062
DELIVERED.

36:05.062 --> 36:08.399
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.701
HONESTLY, I STILL DON'T KNOW IF

36:10.701 --> 36:12.169
YOU'RE ANY GOOD AT PLUMBING, AND

36:12.169 --> 36:13.938
IF IT TURNS OUT YOU'RE TERRIBLE

36:13.938 --> 36:15.172
AT IT, THAT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE

36:15.172 --> 36:17.041
ALL THIS TEN TIMES FUNNIER.

36:17.041 --> 36:17.875
BUT ONE THING IS FOR SURE, WHEN

36:17.875 --> 36:19.510
IT COMES TO TOILET-BASED CINEMA,

36:19.510 --> 36:21.445
YOU ARE UNPARALLELED.

36:21.445 --> 36:22.647
AND I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT

36:22.647 --> 36:24.448
YOU DO NEXT, BECAUSE REMEMBER:

36:24.448 --> 36:25.650
IF YOU CAN DREAM IT, YOU CAN

36:25.650 --> 36:26.350
TOILET.

36:28.853 --> 36:29.086
EXACTLY.

36:29.086 --> 36:30.254
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

36:30.254 --> 36:32.790
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

36:32.790 --> 36:35.826
GOOD NIGHT!
