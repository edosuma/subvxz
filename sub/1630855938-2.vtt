WEBVTT

00:12.762 --> 00:16.516
(lawnmowers buzzing)

00:41.207 --> 00:42.500
Training Officer:
Mm-hmm.

00:45.086 --> 00:48.173
I came to the police academy
just like you,

00:48.256 --> 00:50.175
um, but I was able to,

00:50.216 --> 00:52.135
to get yelled at
right in my face.

00:53.178 --> 00:57.140
So if you think
you can handle it

00:57.182 --> 01:00.435
to be here, just don't quit.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.818
(recruits clapping)

01:08.860 --> 01:11.404
Eugenia Charles-Newton:
Every time I hear
that another recruit

01:11.488 --> 01:15.283
has left the academy, it's like
my heart sinks, you know?

01:15.367 --> 01:18.328
And it's just one less officer
that's gonna graduate

01:18.370 --> 01:21.206
that's gonna be put out
into the community.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.414
Sgt. Rob Williams:
What's going on?

01:22.707 --> 01:25.168
Recruit 1 (straining):
I can't catch a full breath.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.253
Sgt. Williams:
I need a 55 to the academy.

01:27.337 --> 01:30.548
I've got a recruit,
shortness of breath.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.093
Hey, Carlton, it's Rob.

01:33.176 --> 01:36.054
Well, we have
one of your recruits

01:36.096 --> 01:37.639
wanting to punch out.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.890
Um, no, I'm not kidding you.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.394
Lt. Donnie Kee:
If there's any more
quitters in this group,

01:42.477 --> 01:45.229
just raise your hand
right now and go.

01:45.729 --> 01:47.107
I need to dedicate my time

01:47.190 --> 01:51.194
and my effort to those people
that want to be here.

01:51.235 --> 01:52.987
Work, let's go, do the work!

01:53.446 --> 01:55.699
Eugenia: Lieutenant Kee
is feeling a lot of pressure

01:55.740 --> 02:00.245
because he is expected
to graduate 500 officers

02:00.286 --> 02:01.746
in the next five years.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.581
That's the weight
that we're putting on him.

02:03.665 --> 02:07.335
Sgt. Lucy Dan: You have
one classmate that quit.

02:07.419 --> 02:11.548
Now wave.
You guys, look at him and wave!

02:11.715 --> 02:14.926
-Training Officer: Say goodbye.
-Class: Goodbye.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.762
Sgt. Williams: So another one
bites the dust, 57.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.933
You may have your reasons
for quitting.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.686
I want you
to look deep inside.

02:25.353 --> 02:29.524
Is this really a valid reason,
or is this just my excuse

02:29.607 --> 02:31.776
because I don't want
to put in the effort?

02:33.653 --> 02:36.448
Sgt. Dan: Um,
they're leaving left and right,

02:36.531 --> 02:38.867
and that's kind of
got me worried.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.912
The atmosphere is different,
I guess.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.458
Sgt. Williams:
Especially if it's somebody
that everybody got along with.

02:46.499 --> 02:50.462
If they have to be terminated
or they DOR,

02:50.503 --> 02:52.380
drop on request, they leave.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.341
You can see it,
it has an effect on morale.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.719
Self-doubt.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.138
I really think it is self-doubt

03:00.221 --> 03:02.724
that is creeping
into minds over here.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.644
You guys can do this.
You can do this.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.271
We want you to do this.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.107
-Right?
-Class: Sir, yes, sir.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.319
Sgt. Williams: So real loud,
I want to hear, "I can do this."

03:14.361 --> 03:16.696
-One, two, three.
-Class: I can do this!

03:16.780 --> 03:18.365
Sgt. Williams:
Do it again. One, two, three.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.783
Class:
I can do this!

03:19.824 --> 03:21.910
-Sgt. Williams: One, two, three.
-Class: I can do this!

03:22.327 --> 03:24.704
Sgt. Williams:
No more quitters, we ain't
got time for that, do we?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.539
Class:
Sir, no, sir!

03:32.379 --> 03:35.757
(flag fluttering)

03:41.513 --> 03:43.014
Recruit 2:
Yeah, his is all soft, huh?

03:43.055 --> 03:45.225
Recruit 3: Yeah.
Feels like a cushion...

03:45.308 --> 03:47.227
(overlapping chatter, laughter)

03:47.310 --> 03:49.728
Feels like a cushion
or something.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.523
(indistinct chatter)

03:55.360 --> 03:58.363
Shawvan Levi: Um, Hardy,
Hardy has something to say.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.073
Centurion Hardy:
I just want to say that

04:00.156 --> 04:01.574
if it wasn't for
the friendships I made,

04:01.658 --> 04:03.368
I probably wouldn't have
came back this weekend.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.328
So I'm committed
to you guys already,

04:05.704 --> 04:07.205
and the only way
I'm going out, bro,

04:07.288 --> 04:08.456
is if I fail a class, bro.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.250
-I'm not quitting.
-Recruit 4: I love that.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.544
Hardy: And all I got is y'all,
like, in this situation.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.212
-Recruit 5: Aww...
-Recruit 6: Yes, sir.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.588
Hardy:
So when I look over to my right,

04:15.672 --> 04:18.216
I want to see him putting in
the same effort as me.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.718
If he's not, I'll motivate him,

04:19.759 --> 04:21.386
and I'm look like
I'm going down.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.179
I'ma just need
some motivation from you all.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.389
-You know what I'm saying?
-Recruit 7: Yes, sir.

04:24.723 --> 04:25.890
-Recruit 8: Yes, sir.
-Hardy: Yeah.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.058
That's all I want to say.

04:27.142 --> 04:30.061
(recruits shouting)

04:30.145 --> 04:31.813
Shawvan:
Breathing.

04:31.896 --> 04:32.689
(recruits grunting)

04:32.731 --> 04:34.024
Training Officer:
Keep going.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.402
Antwan Gray:
Takes a lot just to be here.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.659
So, yeah, I would--
i-it's really hard.

04:44.743 --> 04:45.577
(laughs)

04:45.618 --> 04:47.203
I feel like really stressed,

04:47.579 --> 04:50.248
especially when
somebody outs, DORs.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.168
Sgt. Williams: Damn, Hardy.
You jumped when I said fight.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.296
Antwan:
But my motivation right now

04:56.379 --> 04:58.089
is Recruit Hardy.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.425
(recruits shouting)

05:00.467 --> 05:02.427
-(whistle blows)
-Sgt. Williams: End it. End it.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.763
(applause)

05:04.846 --> 05:06.306
Sgt. Williams:
That, ladies and gentlemen,

05:06.389 --> 05:08.099
is a fine specimen

05:08.141 --> 05:10.769
of dinÃ© warriorship
right here.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.355
Goddamn.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.276
Antwan:
Hardy's cool to hang out with,

05:18.360 --> 05:19.986
you know,
where he jokes around.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.947
And the main thing
is every workout,

05:23.031 --> 05:25.200
Hardy's number one here.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.327
But I want to be better
than him

05:27.410 --> 05:29.788
because that's motivation
right there.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.707
When I first saw him, I was
like, "I want to fight you."

05:32.791 --> 05:34.668
He's like,
"Why do you want to fight me?"

05:35.460 --> 05:36.920
I said, "I just want
to know how it feels

05:36.961 --> 05:37.837
to get my butt kicked."

05:37.921 --> 05:38.880
(laughs)

05:38.963 --> 05:39.756
Sgt. Dan:
Rotate one.

05:40.215 --> 05:43.551
Antwan:
That's what I need because
I wanna be like him.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.054
I want to be a beast.

05:46.471 --> 05:50.475
I want to go out there
and never be afraid.

05:54.020 --> 05:54.854
(Antwan sighs)

05:54.938 --> 05:56.815
-Now put that down.
-(kids chattering)

06:00.902 --> 06:03.655
Andrea Gray:
We did not always have
electricity and running water,

06:05.115 --> 06:09.494
and our treat was gas,
(chuckles)

06:09.536 --> 06:12.455
because we used to run
the house on generator.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.251
Now we have running water
and electricity.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.170
The only thing we still do
is haul wood.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.380
Kid:
Dad.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.342
Andrea: I think it was about
a year and a half ago.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.970
He's just like, "I want
to be a police officer."

06:27.345 --> 06:31.349
And I was like,
"Okay, that's fine."

06:31.391 --> 06:35.061
But my sister,
her husband's a police officer,

06:35.145 --> 06:37.689
and she always tells me,
"It's-it's gonna be hard.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.524
It's gonna be hard.
It's not easy."

06:39.607 --> 06:41.693
I was just like, "Okay."

06:43.820 --> 06:46.531
Antwan: Well, I knew some cops
when I was a kid,

06:46.614 --> 06:49.325
and I thought they were cool.
(chuckles)

06:49.701 --> 06:52.537
Like, I always looked at them
like they're brave.

06:52.829 --> 06:53.872
Kid:
Dada.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.792
Antwan:
When I was growing up,

06:57.876 --> 06:59.836
I just remember
there's a lot of fears.

07:01.671 --> 07:04.090
I've always been feared
of heights.

07:04.716 --> 07:08.762
I've always been feared
of stuff, like things in life.

07:10.847 --> 07:14.392
And see my dad the way
he used to be back then,

07:14.434 --> 07:16.061
he used to sell drugs.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.729
(indistinct chatter)

07:17.771 --> 07:19.314
I used to see people
come around the house

07:19.397 --> 07:21.316
that I never knew
who they were,

07:21.983 --> 07:24.235
and they would
dress up gangster-ish,

07:24.319 --> 07:27.572
some meth people
coming around the house

07:27.614 --> 07:30.033
and my dad used
to just smoke outside,

07:30.075 --> 07:31.910
and he used to drink.

07:32.284 --> 07:35.580
So my mom
and dad always fought.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.916
Go put her on the table.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.835
One time I came downstairs,
and my mom tried

07:40.919 --> 07:44.255
to cover up her,
like, her hit marks,

07:44.756 --> 07:47.050
because my dad used
to hit her a lot,

07:47.425 --> 07:51.638
and I was always just afraid.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.600
To this day,
I still think of that time.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.770
Even at the academy,

07:59.771 --> 08:01.940
like, Lieutenant Kee,
he was saying

08:02.023 --> 08:06.444
that I just want you guys
to have the mindset of a lion,

08:06.528 --> 08:09.197
and they fight,
they never give up.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.740
Andrea:
Where's Simba, where's Simba?

08:10.782 --> 08:12.283
Antwan:
I want to be that person,

08:12.784 --> 08:15.829
because I know
I could help people out there,

08:15.912 --> 08:18.832
but I know that fear is just
gonna push me back,

08:18.915 --> 08:23.461
and... if I have fear,
just like they said,

08:23.503 --> 08:25.505
if you have fear,
it's gonna get you killed.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.308
(running footsteps)

08:39.644 --> 08:41.104
Sgt. Williams:
Front leading rest, move!

08:43.815 --> 08:46.443
Yesterday, I saw two recruits

08:46.526 --> 08:49.237
coming out of a hotel
wearing their duty belts.

08:49.612 --> 08:53.199
So who was that yesterday
in that blue Chevy?

08:53.283 --> 08:54.325
Who was that?

08:54.701 --> 08:55.744
Damon Cattleman:
Sir, it was me, sir.

08:55.827 --> 08:56.995
Sgt. Williams:
Cattleman.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.580
Who else?
There was two of you.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.334
-Who was with you, Cattleman?
-Recruit 9: Sir, it was me, sir.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.836
What took you so long
to answer me?

09:05.462 --> 09:07.922
Recruit 9:
Cattleman had a gray truck, sir.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.508
Sgt. Williams:
Fair enough.

09:11.176 --> 09:14.846
Out in public, you are not
to have any outward indications

09:14.888 --> 09:16.765
in that you are training
to be a police officer.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.266
Did we not cover that?

09:18.350 --> 09:19.601
Class:
Sir, yes, sir.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.562
Sgt. Williams: We have
these rules for a reason.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.940
What's happening out there
to our brothers and sisters,

09:26.149 --> 09:29.694
they are being attacked,
unprovoked, ambushed.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.740
That should send a little bit
of a shiver down your spine.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.368
We have to learn
these lessons now.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.161
Class:
Sir, yes, sir.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.163
Sgt. Williams:
Sometimes they're painful.

09:41.164 --> 09:44.125
There is no police academy
anywhere in this country

09:44.209 --> 09:47.212
where it isn't a matter
of life and death.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.630
Let's get them into class.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.715
You know, they're recruits.
They're human.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.759
You know,
they're gonna be afraid.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.888
You can't always call for backup
just 'cause you're scared.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.390
You don't get to be scared.

09:58.682 --> 10:01.101
That's why our commitment
to learning our craft

10:01.184 --> 10:04.562
and being professional saves
our lives out here, alright?

10:04.729 --> 10:06.856
All the lessons we teach,
they're blood lessons.

10:06.898 --> 10:11.236
An officer probably died for us
to learn these things.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.612
Lt. Kee:
Let me see your fingernails.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.906
Sgt. Williams:
If you show up to this job

10:14.989 --> 10:17.701
looking like six foot of shit,

10:18.034 --> 10:20.578
they are gonna
size you up quick,

10:20.662 --> 10:21.830
and then they are gonna
beat you.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.498
We have had
Navajo police officers

10:23.581 --> 10:25.250
beaten to death.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.961
You may go to
a simple trespassing,

10:28.044 --> 10:30.922
and it breaks down
into a fight.

10:31.006 --> 10:31.798
Get back.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.383
Get back, get back.

10:33.425 --> 10:34.926
Back, back, back,
back, back.

10:34.968 --> 10:38.430
Sgt. Williams: And now you have
a one-on-one situation,

10:38.471 --> 10:39.764
so I'm kind of

10:39.806 --> 10:43.560
the mean disciplinarian figure
for a reason.

10:43.601 --> 10:44.602
End it. End it.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.438
If you ever take it easy

10:46.521 --> 10:48.106
on one of your brothers
or sisters again,

10:48.148 --> 10:51.943
I want you to realize you may
be responsible for their death.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.446
-Fight!
-(fighters grunting)

10:54.904 --> 10:58.324
Lt. Kee: It's a necessary part
of their indoctrination

10:58.408 --> 11:00.243
into a lifestyle...

11:00.285 --> 11:01.494
(recruits shouting)

11:01.578 --> 11:05.206
Lt. Kee: ...to be able to act
violently when necessary.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.459
Sgt. Williams:
Both hands on that gun hand.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.460
(whistle blows)

11:08.543 --> 11:10.295
Lt. Kee:
I love the double time.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.088
It's constant testing...

11:12.130 --> 11:13.548
Do it all the time.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.175
...training in
the Marine Corps,

11:15.633 --> 11:17.802
and it was,
it was punishment.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.346
You, on your feet.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.806
Lt. Kee:
They just punished
you nonstop.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.475
-Where's your belly?
-Recruit 10: Right here, sir.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.143
Pet your belly,
rub your head.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.770
Lt. Kee:
But at the same time,

11:26.811 --> 11:28.980
it's allowed me
to subject myself

11:29.064 --> 11:31.483
to things that normal people
probably wouldn't.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.110
-Grant Keams: Alright, ready.
-Hardy: Navajo Police!

11:34.152 --> 11:36.946
Get down on the ground!
Navajo Police!

11:36.988 --> 11:37.781
Switch!

11:37.822 --> 11:38.782
Cheyenne Pettigrew:
Navajo Police!

11:38.823 --> 11:40.450
Get down on the ground.

11:40.492 --> 11:41.659
Show me your hands.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.787
Lt. Kee:
I have a lot of responsibility

11:43.828 --> 11:45.163
to prepare them

11:45.246 --> 11:47.457
for really what they're gonna
be out there facing.

11:47.499 --> 11:48.833
It would be a terrible thing

11:48.875 --> 11:51.461
to send somebody out there
who isn't prepared.

11:54.798 --> 11:57.342
(indistinct chatter)

11:59.844 --> 12:01.680
Training Officer:
So your property sheet,

12:01.763 --> 12:03.973
it says brand block,

12:04.015 --> 12:06.351
right next to it is
the serial number.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.020
That is gonna be
for your gun.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.690
When you pass academy,

12:11.773 --> 12:14.275
this firearm will go
with you everywhere.

12:14.359 --> 12:18.363
So you might as well remember
that serial number.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.949
Go ahead
and remove the magazine.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.244
Lock the slide back.

12:25.203 --> 12:28.206
Confirm that
it's an empty firearm.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.043
Sgt. Williams:
What are you doing there?
Watch your muzzle.

12:32.127 --> 12:34.129
-Training Officer:
...by the trigger...
-Shawvan: Yes, sir.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.215
Training Officer:
...that is your serial number.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.385
Should be the same one
if you look at your box.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.512
(gun clicking)

12:42.554 --> 12:43.972
(indistinct chatter)

12:44.055 --> 12:45.557
Sgt. Williams:
Real quick, eyes up.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.559
For those of you
who are having trouble,

12:47.600 --> 12:48.727
you're gonna reach over,

12:48.810 --> 12:50.478
grab the nice little
serrations block

12:50.562 --> 12:51.646
put there for you,

12:51.730 --> 12:53.898
pull back hard,
push up with your thumb.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.276
That will lock your slide
to the rear.

12:56.985 --> 13:00.655
Don't be afraid of it.
It's just another tool.

13:00.739 --> 13:01.865
It's not going to hurt you

13:01.906 --> 13:04.325
unless you do something
stupid with it, right?

13:04.409 --> 13:06.119
-Class: Yes, sir.
-Sgt. Williams: Okay.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.537
You guys will learn a lot.

13:08.038 --> 13:11.124
Don't be worried about
what you don't know yet.

13:11.541 --> 13:14.294
We're gonna
train you to shoot.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.587
Anything else?

13:17.047 --> 13:18.340
Okay.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.305
(patrons chattering)

13:25.388 --> 13:26.431
Shawvan:
Hey, mom.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.933
Shawvan: Happy you could
join us for lunch.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.852
I know it's like me
and my son.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.562
We don't really talk.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.064
-Just kidding.
-(laughter)

13:35.940 --> 13:38.193
Shawvan:
Oh. I just told Steph last week

13:38.276 --> 13:40.445
they gave us
our duty weapons already.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.447
Shawmarie Bainbridge:
What about the shooting part?

13:42.781 --> 13:44.491
You feel confident about it?

13:44.574 --> 13:45.700
Shawvan:
Yeah.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.787
Shawmarie: I'm worried
about you, and I'm like,

13:48.828 --> 13:52.248
oh, what made you want
to do this anyways?

13:52.790 --> 13:55.460
Remember you wanted
to be a pop star,

13:55.502 --> 13:56.961
a rapper,

13:57.796 --> 13:59.339
a dancer?

13:59.422 --> 14:00.965
(Shawvan speaking)

14:02.967 --> 14:03.885
I don't know.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.804
Honestly, I think one thing

14:05.845 --> 14:07.639
that made me want to do it,

14:07.681 --> 14:10.100
my dad's side of the family.

14:10.141 --> 14:13.019
My last name here
on the reservation

14:13.103 --> 14:14.771
is pretty well known.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.272
Stephanie Sanisya:
In a not-so-good way.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.650
Shawvan: Yeah. Like,
remember I was helping out

14:18.692 --> 14:20.860
transport people
that are going to jail?

14:21.152 --> 14:24.781
There's a couple of guys
where they read my badge

14:24.864 --> 14:28.159
and they're like,
"Levi? Are you with the Levis?"

14:28.201 --> 14:29.994
And I just stand there,
I'm like,

14:30.036 --> 14:31.871
"Well, I mean,
my last name's Levi."

14:31.955 --> 14:33.206
They're like, "Oh, okay."

14:33.289 --> 14:35.583
And then they just
start looking away.

14:38.253 --> 14:42.382
My dad's side of the family,
it has a bad reputation.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.009
Like, my uncles,

14:44.050 --> 14:46.344
they've been to prison,
and they've recently come out.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.805
I've actually had contact
with one of them.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.641
I had to transport my uncle,

14:52.308 --> 14:54.769
and he was upset
about the whole thing

14:54.853 --> 14:57.397
and calling out threats
and stuff,

14:57.480 --> 14:58.440
but I was wearing a mask

14:58.523 --> 15:02.235
so he didn't recognize me
or anything.

15:04.487 --> 15:05.363
Yeah.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.365
Stephanie:
Be careful. Come this way.

15:07.449 --> 15:08.908
Wow, look.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.494
Shawvan: I am kind of worried
about my dad's side

15:11.536 --> 15:13.371
finding out what my job is

15:13.455 --> 15:17.000
because they-they hate cops
no matter what.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.543
Shawvan's son:
Look, look, look, look.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.836
(Stephanie and Shawvan gasp)

15:20.003 --> 15:21.212
-Shawvan: Oh, shoot.
-Stephanie: Oh, yeah.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.423
Shawvan:
There's, er, some new art.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.924
(laughter)

15:25.300 --> 15:27.552
Just kind of seeing
how they were growing up

15:27.635 --> 15:28.928
and how they still are,

15:29.012 --> 15:30.805
I want to do
something different.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.933
Something to be there
to actually help

15:34.017 --> 15:37.687
and signify
that I'm not associated

15:37.729 --> 15:40.440
with the Levis' bad name.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.577
(Dispatcher 1 over radio)

15:55.038 --> 15:56.706
Sgt. Eldon Foster:
I have an unresponsive.

15:57.874 --> 15:58.917
Alright.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.086
Dispatcher 2: I don't know
who called it in...

16:04.297 --> 16:06.424
Sgt. Foster:
Alright, bye.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.176
Alcohol is illegal
in the reservation

16:08.259 --> 16:09.803
according to Navajo Nation law,

16:09.886 --> 16:12.055
but we still have our people

16:12.097 --> 16:15.517
that suffer from,
you know, alcohol addiction.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.817
Speaker 1:
I barely woke up, so...

16:24.025 --> 16:25.110
Sgt. Foster:
Were you guys drinking?

16:25.193 --> 16:26.653
Speaker 1:
In the morning, we was.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.613
Sgt. Foster: Alright. Just wait
on the side of the house, man.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.699
-Yep.
-Speaker 1: Oh, fuck.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.786
Sgt. Foster: They're drinking
early this morning

16:34.828 --> 16:37.956
and looks like he threw up
and choked

16:37.997 --> 16:39.457
probably when he was
passed out.

16:43.336 --> 16:47.173
So right now, he's unresponsive.
I-- he's-he's gone.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.301
There's, like,
no pulse, nothing.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.137
Yeah.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.891
Speaker 2: What the fuck
did you guys fucking do to him?

16:57.308 --> 16:58.601
Sgt. Foster:
Hey, calm down. calm down.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.311
-Speaker 1: I didn't do nothing.
-Sgt. Foster: Calm down.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.646
Speaker 1:
Your cousin dropped him off.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.815
Speaker 2: You're the reason
why he's fucking dead.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.069
I'm like, fuck,
I don't want to get arrested

17:09.154 --> 17:10.280
for nothing I didn't do.

17:11.321 --> 17:14.200
It gets me sad when I'm in here
because I have a clean record.

17:14.284 --> 17:15.452
I barely turned 18. I don't--

17:15.492 --> 17:17.454
I don't want to
go back to jail, yo.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.150
(siren wailing)

17:47.192 --> 17:50.570
Eugenia: It's hard to live here
on the Navajo Nation.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.156
There's nothing to do here.

17:53.198 --> 17:55.658
And as a result of that,
our Navajo people suffer.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.951
They suffer because the services

17:56.993 --> 17:58.745
that are promised to them
are not delivered.

17:59.287 --> 18:02.791
We do have a 638 contract
right now.

18:02.874 --> 18:05.377
It's a contract that's between

18:05.460 --> 18:09.714
the United States
of America and tribes.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.217
1868 with the Navajo Treaty,

18:12.258 --> 18:13.343
that's how long
we've been under

18:13.385 --> 18:15.762
the federal government's hands
you know.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.430
We are the, um,

18:17.514 --> 18:19.599
the stepchild
to the federal government.

18:19.683 --> 18:20.767
I use this analogy,

18:20.850 --> 18:23.853
how many of you guys
have watched the movie "Friday"?

18:25.063 --> 18:27.357
The older people
don't want to admit it.

18:27.399 --> 18:28.316
(laughter)

18:28.400 --> 18:30.110
Eugenia:
Do you remember the mom

18:30.193 --> 18:32.237
gives that dollar bill
to Smokey

18:32.278 --> 18:35.323
and she says, "Go buy me
a pack of cigarettes."

18:35.573 --> 18:38.910
And he looks at that dollar and
he says, "This isn't enough."

18:38.993 --> 18:41.037
And she says,
"Well, go make it enough."

18:41.663 --> 18:44.290
That's BIA telling
the Navajo Nation,

18:44.374 --> 18:45.792
"Go make it enough."

18:47.293 --> 18:49.504
When people are driving
through the Navajo Nation

18:49.587 --> 18:51.464
and they see the way
that we live,

18:51.548 --> 18:54.050
they, you know, probably think,
you know,

18:54.092 --> 18:56.678
"Just make the choice
to get out of it."

18:57.095 --> 19:00.306
It's not that easy.
We don't own the land.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.935
We lease the land
from the federal government.

19:04.519 --> 19:08.773
I cannot go to the bank
for a loan to build my home.

19:08.857 --> 19:12.193
The only thing that people
can credit are mobile homes.

19:12.902 --> 19:16.740
And we can't just have Walmart
come on to build here.

19:17.323 --> 19:20.952
It takes six months
to six years to get processed.

19:21.244 --> 19:24.706
And businesses, you know,
th-they lose interest.

19:25.457 --> 19:27.375
The laws work against us.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.628
We can't just pick ourselves up
by the bootstrap

19:30.712 --> 19:32.464
and say we're gonna
change our life.

19:42.974 --> 19:46.227
(recruits chattering, laughing)

19:51.816 --> 19:52.817
Recruit 11:
Oh.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.949
(indistinct chatter)

20:00.158 --> 20:01.451
Recruit 11:
Go, Levi. Go, Levi.

20:01.493 --> 20:04.537
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

20:04.621 --> 20:06.664
(cheering)

20:09.459 --> 20:11.461
Training Officer:
You still have the keys?

20:13.963 --> 20:16.299
Lt. Kee:
Okay. Line up by size now.

20:18.051 --> 20:22.639
Allen, Largo, first two.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.476
-(whistle blows)
-Come on, Allen.

20:26.518 --> 20:27.394
(grunts)

20:27.519 --> 20:28.770
Recruit 12:
Come on, Allen.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.855
(recruits shouting)

20:30.939 --> 20:32.899
-Recruit 11: Come on, Allen!
-Lt. Kee: Keep fighting, Allen!

20:32.982 --> 20:34.359
Recruit 11:
Come on, Allen.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.821
Nora Allen: I never backed down
from fighting a male.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.866
Growing up, I tried playing
with my cousin's sisters,

20:41.908 --> 20:43.535
but they were always running
to my mom,

20:43.618 --> 20:46.413
"Oh, Nora's making me cry.
She's too rough."

20:46.496 --> 20:48.039
(recruits shouting)

20:48.123 --> 20:49.874
Lt. Kee:
Get both hands on that arm!

20:50.375 --> 20:54.129
Nora: Growing up, my mom was
a probation officer.

20:54.170 --> 20:57.507
I would sneak into her bag
and open her books

20:57.549 --> 20:59.426
and just start looking at 'em.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.553
It was in those moments

21:01.594 --> 21:04.264
that I knew I wanted
to become a police officer.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.724
-Sgt. Williams: Tuck in.
-Lt. Kee: Roll him over!

21:05.807 --> 21:06.725
There you go!

21:06.766 --> 21:08.226
-There you go!
-Recruit 13: Come on!

21:08.309 --> 21:09.227
(whistle blows)

21:09.310 --> 21:10.186
Sgt. Williams:
Hey, nice.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.646
Lt. Kee:
Good job.

21:12.230 --> 21:15.233
Nora:
But I kind of put it off

21:15.316 --> 21:19.863
because in a sense
I felt like I wasn't ready.

21:19.904 --> 21:24.117
You know, just growing up
on the reservation,

21:24.200 --> 21:26.745
I went through a lot.

21:26.786 --> 21:27.871
A lot, lot.

21:30.165 --> 21:33.585
(metal clanking)

21:33.626 --> 21:34.919
(creaking)

21:42.302 --> 21:44.763
(cow huffing)

21:50.643 --> 21:52.645
And he said
not to go in there, right?

21:53.104 --> 21:54.105
Charles Allen:
You can.

21:54.522 --> 21:55.732
Just watch out for that ram.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.108
(Nora laughs)

21:59.027 --> 22:01.696
Charles: Ever since we've been
together, we've been a team.

22:01.863 --> 22:03.323
See, as you cut it.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.035
Oh.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.121
(Charles chuckles)

22:12.457 --> 22:14.959
Really, I'm scared for her.

22:15.043 --> 22:18.963
It's just all the dangers
involved being a police officer,

22:20.465 --> 22:24.052
but here to support her
however I can,

22:24.135 --> 22:25.637
whatever she needs.

22:27.305 --> 22:29.307
We've been through
so much together

22:29.391 --> 22:32.060
and still continue
to build together.

22:34.104 --> 22:39.609
I'm very grateful because
my ex-husband was terrible.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.947
Mental abuse, physical abuse,

22:43.988 --> 22:46.408
and he was not supportive

22:46.491 --> 22:48.785
of my decision
to become an officer.

22:49.994 --> 22:50.912
He would sit there and say,

22:50.995 --> 22:52.789
"You're just broke.
You're just dumb.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.040
"You're just stupid.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.334
You're never gonna be a cop."

22:56.376 --> 23:00.171
And so I guess
I doubted myself a lot.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.925
Charles:
She don't see it,

23:04.300 --> 23:06.594
but she has a fire in her,

23:06.678 --> 23:09.514
so I know
she can handle herself.

23:10.515 --> 23:13.768
Whether she sees it or not.

23:15.353 --> 23:18.523
(pensive music playing)

23:22.360 --> 23:24.779
(wind gusting)

23:28.116 --> 23:30.160
(tarps fluttering)

23:35.040 --> 23:36.666
(rumbling)

23:36.708 --> 23:38.043
Training Officer:
Oh!

23:45.383 --> 23:46.384
Keams:
Fuck yeah.

23:46.718 --> 23:48.178
If anybody have
any issues loading?

23:53.683 --> 23:54.309
(grunts)

23:54.392 --> 23:55.727
Sgt. Williams:
Seriously?

24:01.232 --> 24:03.526
(both laugh)

24:03.568 --> 24:05.653
Sgt. Williams: Okay, so you're
acting like a bunch

24:05.737 --> 24:07.238
of horny teenagers
on prom night,

24:07.280 --> 24:09.574
so we're just gonna get it
out of your system, alright?

24:09.657 --> 24:11.159
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna do a mag dump.

24:11.242 --> 24:14.954
We're gonna pull that trigger
as fast as you can.

24:15.038 --> 24:16.039
Okay.

24:16.539 --> 24:19.042
Hey. Fire.

24:20.877 --> 24:25.048
(gunfire)

24:32.931 --> 24:35.350
Keep pulling. Keep pulling.
Just pull it.

24:35.433 --> 24:36.768
Sgt. Williams:
Just pull the trigger.

24:40.438 --> 24:43.233
(indistinct) in the holster.

24:43.274 --> 24:45.318
Sgt. Gary Franklin: Alright,
Allen, I know you get mental,

24:45.402 --> 24:47.070
alright?

24:47.112 --> 24:49.280
I know it already.

24:49.364 --> 24:50.657
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna try

24:50.740 --> 24:52.200
to get you confident, okay?

24:53.660 --> 24:55.662
Go and get
some face targets up.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.042
Sgt. Williams:
Good.

25:01.126 --> 25:02.627
Alright, here we go.

25:02.919 --> 25:03.837
(buzzer blares)

25:05.255 --> 25:08.925
(gunfire)

25:12.387 --> 25:14.389
Sgt. Williams: Okay.
You understand the importance
of not missing, right?

25:14.472 --> 25:16.558
-Recruit: Yes, sir.
-Sgt. Williams: Somebody
could be back there.

25:16.641 --> 25:18.977
If you get it in the snow,
you owe me 10,

25:19.019 --> 25:20.437
because if it lands
in the snow,

25:20.478 --> 25:22.647
that represents
somebody's grandma,

25:22.731 --> 25:24.941
the nicest old fucking grandma
in the community

25:24.983 --> 25:27.777
who made everybody
fresh fry bread every morning,

25:27.819 --> 25:30.071
always had a pot
of coffee on for you,

25:30.155 --> 25:31.740
and you fuckin' shot her.

25:32.490 --> 25:33.742
Little pressure?

25:34.367 --> 25:37.037
There's consequences
to our actions.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.329
Get serious.

25:38.413 --> 25:41.124
Okay, two standing,
three kneeling.

25:41.958 --> 25:42.876
(buzzer blares)

25:43.335 --> 25:44.669
Training Officer:
Take your time.

25:45.503 --> 25:46.880
Shawvan:
Before the last class,

25:46.963 --> 25:48.965
I never really shot a gun...

25:49.007 --> 25:49.924
(gunshot)

25:50.008 --> 25:53.303
...and it can
be stressful, so...

25:54.429 --> 25:55.722
Sgt. Williams:
What we got here.

25:57.140 --> 26:00.101
Are you gonna explain that
to her parents?

26:00.185 --> 26:01.102
Shawvan:
Yes, sir.

26:01.186 --> 26:04.230
What scares me
is making a mistake.

26:04.314 --> 26:06.816
Sgt. Williams:
You lined the sight,
you pressed the trigger.

26:06.858 --> 26:08.568
Are you gonna go
to court and say,

26:08.651 --> 26:10.695
"Well, your honor,
I was startled."

26:10.779 --> 26:13.948
You're still going
to fucking prison, right?

26:14.032 --> 26:15.200
(whistle blows)

26:16.451 --> 26:18.244
Stephanie:
Shawvan's very empathetic.

26:18.328 --> 26:20.288
(gunfire)

26:20.372 --> 26:22.499
He wants to do
the right thing,

26:22.540 --> 26:26.294
but he overthinks a lot,

26:26.378 --> 26:30.757
and I think that's one thing
I talk to him about

26:30.840 --> 26:33.009
while he's at the academy,

26:33.051 --> 26:34.844
'cause he can overthink
to the point

26:34.886 --> 26:37.722
where he makes himself
physically sick.

26:38.556 --> 26:41.393
The thing I noticed about the
two of them is they're mental.

26:41.810 --> 26:43.311
They're just mental cases.

26:47.732 --> 26:50.068
He's flat out, like, shaking.

26:50.985 --> 26:52.737
He's on that trigger,
and he's stressing so much

26:52.821 --> 26:54.572
that you can see
the little twitch.

26:55.365 --> 26:57.158
Sgt. Williams: Don't confuse
yourself on this stuff.

26:57.242 --> 26:59.411
This is a shootable target.
I already told you.

26:59.452 --> 27:00.745
This is a deadly threat.

27:01.037 --> 27:02.372
All you got
to do is shoot it.

27:23.560 --> 27:27.147
(recruits chattering)

27:29.733 --> 27:31.860
Karletta Tso-Tapahanso:
So this is what we're gonna do.

27:32.152 --> 27:34.988
Don't be hit at C, right?
In that area.

27:35.071 --> 27:38.950
You wait until she gets
to A or B, right?

27:43.621 --> 27:45.874
That's all you're gonna do.

27:45.957 --> 27:47.792
Sgt. Dan:
Pettigrew, where are your hands?

27:47.834 --> 27:51.421
(staff whooshing)

27:53.131 --> 27:54.132
(staff thuds)

27:59.429 --> 28:00.472
Cheyenne:
Ma'am, no, ma'am.

28:04.434 --> 28:07.437
(staff whooshing)

28:10.106 --> 28:11.900
Sgt. Dan:
Time it, time it.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.287
Tso-Tapahanso:
Come on this side.

28:31.002 --> 28:34.047
Okay. Pettigrew did
a pretty good job.

28:34.339 --> 28:36.925
Yeah, you guys can sit back
and judge her

28:37.008 --> 28:38.802
because she hit her arm,
hit her wrist,

28:39.177 --> 28:40.970
but she still managed
to do something

28:41.012 --> 28:42.889
very few of you guys
wanted to do.

28:45.684 --> 28:48.269
(wind rustling)

28:55.151 --> 28:57.362
Cheyenne: I just used
a little bit of Dawn dish soap

28:57.445 --> 28:59.030
and got it clean.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.073
Karen Johnson:
Yeah.

29:00.156 --> 29:01.241
Cheyenne:
But we still have, like,

29:01.324 --> 29:02.826
the gun stuff.

29:03.326 --> 29:07.205
Then I know we have, like,
80 hours of defensive tactics,

29:07.247 --> 29:09.916
so I'll keep coming home
with big bruises.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.085
-(Cheyenne laughs)
-Oh, my goodness.

29:14.295 --> 29:15.964
When she comes back
on the weekend,

29:16.047 --> 29:18.591
she lets us know
what's going on.

29:19.217 --> 29:22.595
The other day she says, "Mom,
I have something to tell you."

29:22.804 --> 29:24.723
And I was gonna tell her,
"Just don't tell me

29:24.806 --> 29:26.558
you dropped out
of the academy."

29:26.599 --> 29:28.309
(laughs)

29:28.393 --> 29:30.145
And she's like, "No.

29:30.228 --> 29:32.564
"When I finish,
I want to come back

29:32.647 --> 29:34.065
"and teach
at the academy too,

29:34.149 --> 29:36.234
to help get more recruits."

29:37.569 --> 29:39.154
I'm really proud of her.

29:39.904 --> 29:42.991
You know, I have two boys
and one girl,

29:43.074 --> 29:47.412
and my only girl decides to go
to the police academy,

29:47.495 --> 29:50.457
and I think everybody
was kind of surprised.

29:50.665 --> 29:53.001
I'm not sure why
everyone was surprised.

29:53.084 --> 29:54.336
(laughs)

29:54.794 --> 29:56.755
They probably just thought
it was comfortable

29:56.838 --> 30:00.550
with being a dispatcher
and they were happy with me

30:00.592 --> 30:02.635
just sitting
in the police department

30:02.719 --> 30:04.804
in a safe area.
(chuckles)

30:06.264 --> 30:07.432
But, um...

30:07.891 --> 30:10.310
Karen: Well, to become
a police officer,

30:10.518 --> 30:11.561
it is dangerous.

30:11.603 --> 30:12.854
And I did think about that.

30:12.937 --> 30:13.897
I don't know.

30:13.938 --> 30:16.775
I'm-I'm hoping
that she can be able

30:16.816 --> 30:18.651
to handle it physically,

30:18.735 --> 30:21.738
when-- if there's ever
an incident,

30:22.113 --> 30:25.325
because she's my only daughter

30:26.618 --> 30:30.830
and we believe in prayer.

30:31.456 --> 30:33.958
We believe in prayer
and putting it in God's hands.

30:47.138 --> 30:49.766
Sgt. Williams: Alright.
Questions, comments, concerns?

30:49.808 --> 30:51.643
-Class: Sir, no, sir.
-Sgt. Williams: Okay.

30:51.976 --> 30:54.813
Don't necessarily
hyperfocus like,

30:55.063 --> 30:56.314
"Oh, shit,
what am I gonna do?"

30:56.398 --> 30:58.483
You know, when you start getting
that tunnel vision,

30:58.525 --> 31:01.194
because you didn't practice
your combat breathing,

31:01.277 --> 31:03.863
so now you're scared,
and you're giving into fear,

31:03.947 --> 31:07.659
and your body's taking over,
and you can't stop it.

31:07.742 --> 31:09.703
Julius is gonna be
all paranoid now.

31:09.786 --> 31:10.995
He's gonna get down
behind Haskin.

31:11.079 --> 31:12.497
He's gonna hold her up.

31:12.539 --> 31:13.998
(class laughing)

31:14.040 --> 31:15.625
Tso-Tapahanso:
From the time you get maced,

31:15.667 --> 31:17.377
all positive thoughts.

31:17.669 --> 31:19.045
You start thinking negative,

31:19.129 --> 31:21.673
it's gonna go downhill
really fast.

31:21.715 --> 31:23.008
Good?

31:23.258 --> 31:25.176
Oh, man,
this is gonna suck.

31:25.218 --> 31:26.594
Recruit 14:
Go, Levi. Go, Levi.

31:29.514 --> 31:31.391
-(spray hisses)
-Ah, sh--

31:31.808 --> 31:34.019
-Training Officer:
Fuck you, Levi!
-Recruit 14: Let's go, Levi.

31:34.102 --> 31:35.937
Training Officer:
Fucking piece of shit.

31:36.021 --> 31:38.189
Shawvan:
Suspect's running west on foot.

31:38.356 --> 31:40.191
-Training Officer: 10-4.
-Recruit 14: Come on, Levi!

31:40.817 --> 31:44.529
Drop it! Turn around!
Get on your knees!

31:45.030 --> 31:46.531
Keep your arms straight out!

31:46.614 --> 31:48.533
Stay right there. Don't move.

31:48.616 --> 31:49.534
Sgt. Dan:
Good.

31:51.494 --> 31:53.288
Training Officer 1: Make sure
you're reassuring yourself.

31:53.371 --> 31:57.042
Find that you're okay.
Calm down, take deep breaths.

31:57.292 --> 31:58.918
Training Officer 2:
Sergeant, water.

31:59.753 --> 32:00.754
(coughing)

32:00.837 --> 32:01.880
Training Officer 2:
Wash it up.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.173
Tso-Tapahanso:
Get ready. Next one.

32:03.214 --> 32:04.382
Recruit 15:
Let's go, Gray.

32:04.466 --> 32:05.550
(spray hissing)

32:08.136 --> 32:09.471
Training Officer:
Come on, officer. Let's go.

32:09.512 --> 32:10.889
Antwan:
Put the bat down!

32:10.972 --> 32:12.015
Put the blue bat down.

32:12.057 --> 32:13.058
(bat clanging)

32:13.141 --> 32:14.893
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes.

32:14.934 --> 32:16.603
Open your eyes.

32:16.686 --> 32:18.980
Do not move!

32:19.064 --> 32:20.523
Training Officer:
You need to wash your face.

32:20.565 --> 32:21.733
Use your hands.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.069
Okay.
Move your hands.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.945
Stretch your hands.

32:26.029 --> 32:27.322
Don't touch your eyeball.

32:27.405 --> 32:28.573
(Antwan grunts)

32:28.865 --> 32:29.991
Training Officer:
Good.

32:30.075 --> 32:31.368
Okay, no more water, guys.

32:31.409 --> 32:32.619
(Antwan groans)

32:32.702 --> 32:34.329
Training Officer:
Ready!

32:34.412 --> 32:36.581
Tso-Tapahanso:
Positive mindset.

32:36.873 --> 32:38.458
-Recruit 15: Go, Billy.
-Recruit 16: Go, Billy.

32:38.541 --> 32:39.542
(spray hisses)

32:39.751 --> 32:40.794
-Recruit 15: Come on, Billy.
-Sgt. Dan: Let's go,

32:40.877 --> 32:42.379
you little bitch!

32:42.587 --> 32:43.421
(Billy grunting)

32:43.505 --> 32:44.923
Recruit 15:
Go, Billy. Go, Billy.

32:45.006 --> 32:47.300
Sgt. Dan: Come On, Billy,
open your eyes!

32:49.761 --> 32:51.513
Come on, Billy,
get your head up!

32:51.596 --> 32:52.514
Look where you're going.

32:52.597 --> 32:54.933
(Billy panting)

32:55.600 --> 32:57.727
Sgt. Dan: Get your--
look at your suspect!

32:57.769 --> 33:00.105
(coughing)

33:01.314 --> 33:03.274
Looks like he's panicking
a little bit.

33:03.316 --> 33:04.943
Sgt. Dan:
Breathe. Breathe.

33:04.984 --> 33:06.111
Lt. Kee:
A little bit overwhelming.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.071
Training Officer:
Hey! Come on!

33:08.113 --> 33:10.740
Get your fucking gun out
and get it done.

33:11.658 --> 33:14.953
You're not done yet.
Keep going. You can breathe.

33:15.245 --> 33:17.455
Billy, can you hear me?
Focus on me.

33:17.497 --> 33:20.000
-Billy, focus on me.
-(Billy grunts)

33:20.083 --> 33:21.793
-Calm down.
-Need the 55, guys.

33:21.876 --> 33:23.044
I can't do it.

33:23.962 --> 33:25.714
(Billy groaning)

33:27.298 --> 33:29.426
Tso-Tapahanso
Come on, Pettigrew. Ready?

33:29.551 --> 33:31.052
Recruit 16:
Let's go, Pettigrew. Come on.

33:31.469 --> 33:33.805
Cheyenne:
Drop the bat! Drop it! Drop it!

33:33.888 --> 33:35.306
Training Officer:
Come on.

33:35.390 --> 33:36.558
(panting)

33:36.599 --> 33:37.767
Tso-Tapahanso:
Slow down.

33:37.809 --> 33:39.352
(panting)

33:39.436 --> 33:41.354
Tso-Tapahanso: Switch over.
Positive control.

33:41.438 --> 33:43.148
Training Officer:
Calm yourself.

33:44.024 --> 33:45.442
Cheyenne:
Water. Water.

33:45.483 --> 33:46.985
Okay. Here. Here.

33:47.068 --> 33:49.988
Keep your head sideways.
Okay. Relax.

33:50.071 --> 33:52.699
Relax. Good job.

33:52.782 --> 33:54.117
Sgt. Dan:
Hardy, let's go.

33:55.035 --> 33:56.578
(Hardy groaning)

33:56.786 --> 33:58.079
I can't breathe.
I can't control it.

33:58.163 --> 33:59.748
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

34:01.583 --> 34:03.001
-Recruit 15: Let's go, Allen.
-Sgt. Dan: Go.

34:03.168 --> 34:04.961
(Nora coughing)

34:05.170 --> 34:06.421
Sgt. Dan: Come on.
What are you gonna do now?

34:06.504 --> 34:07.881
Recruit: Let's go, Allen.
Come on, fight through it.

34:07.964 --> 34:10.967
(Billy grunting, panting)

34:11.009 --> 34:12.385
Deep breaths.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.681
Tso-Tapahanso:
Calm down.

34:19.768 --> 34:20.935
Sorry, ma'am.

34:21.311 --> 34:24.898
Just because you decided
to get mental and weak.

34:25.315 --> 34:28.485
I have ten others that are
freaking out over there.

34:29.485 --> 34:31.571
-Positive mindset.
-Billy: Sorry, ma'am.

34:33.197 --> 34:35.158
Tso-Tapahanso:
Don't allow yourself to panic.

34:35.492 --> 34:38.036
Fear is not what we're gonna
let get the best of this.

34:38.078 --> 34:39.454
You guys can all do it.

34:39.536 --> 34:42.040
I've seen you go
through more this week.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.291
(grunting)

34:43.375 --> 34:45.043
Shawvan:
You're okay. You're okay.

34:45.085 --> 34:47.295
Control. Control.

34:47.379 --> 34:49.214
Positive thoughts
from here, Hardy.

34:49.714 --> 34:51.216
(groaning)

34:51.257 --> 34:52.634
Lt. Kee:
It's a good day.

34:52.967 --> 34:54.219
Learning is occurring.

34:54.511 --> 34:56.721
You know, in order to
build a team,

34:56.804 --> 34:59.140
your group either has to
accomplish something together

34:59.224 --> 35:00.266
or they suffer together.

35:00.767 --> 35:02.268
Even better if they
accomplished something

35:02.352 --> 35:04.270
while suffering together.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.774
Just don't tense up.
Just keep breathing.

35:07.857 --> 35:09.401
It will get better
from here.

35:10.276 --> 35:12.112
Tso-Tapahanso: Pettigrew,
she panicked a little,

35:12.195 --> 35:14.155
but she managed.

35:14.239 --> 35:15.990
(Tso-Tapahanso speaking Navajo)

35:16.074 --> 35:17.075
Ready? Cheese.

35:17.117 --> 35:18.952
Class:
Cheese.

35:19.035 --> 35:19.953
(camera shutter clicking)

35:20.036 --> 35:21.287
(Tso-Tapahanso speaking)

35:22.914 --> 35:24.165
(Billy speaking)

35:29.254 --> 35:32.215
(solemn music playing)

35:40.306 --> 35:41.766
Sgt. Dan:
Good morning, Lieutenant.

35:42.267 --> 35:43.935
Are you busy?

35:44.019 --> 35:45.770
(Lt. Kee over phone)

35:45.812 --> 35:46.896
Sgt. Dan:
Okay.

35:47.230 --> 35:51.443
Um, Billy is gonna DOR.

35:52.777 --> 35:53.945
Lt. Kee:
Shit.

35:54.029 --> 35:55.113
Mm-hmm.

35:55.155 --> 35:56.614
-Um...
-Lt. Kee: Is he, uh...

36:00.243 --> 36:01.870
Sgt. Dan:
Yeah, pretty much.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.789
Lt. Kee: Is there no
talking him out of it?

36:04.873 --> 36:05.915
Sgt. Dan:
No.

36:10.420 --> 36:14.341
(somber music playing)

36:34.235 --> 36:36.488
Lt. Kee: On command, you're
gonna draw your firearm.

36:36.529 --> 36:38.865
You're gonna assume
a kneeling position.

36:40.367 --> 36:42.827
Allen, put your knee up
like you did before.

36:44.871 --> 36:48.500
That even changes the way
that it feels in your hips.

36:48.541 --> 36:51.002
It creates tension
in your quads.

36:52.337 --> 36:55.215
(guns clicking)

36:59.052 --> 37:00.303
Press it hard.

37:03.765 --> 37:05.975
Press it. Work it.

37:08.061 --> 37:09.521
Nora:
It's tough, you know?

37:09.938 --> 37:12.607
I honestly didn't think
I would make it this far.

37:14.317 --> 37:15.694
Sgt. Williams:
Mm-hmm.

37:18.363 --> 37:19.698
Nora: I've tried
to just tell myself,

37:19.781 --> 37:22.534
keep pushing forward
no matter what.

37:24.536 --> 37:25.704
-Nora: Yes, sir.
-Can you do that?

37:25.745 --> 37:27.539
-Nora: Yes, sir.
-(training officer yells)

37:29.582 --> 37:33.378
Nora: I used to have nightmares
about my ex-husband,

37:34.379 --> 37:36.756
what I've gone through
mentally,

37:36.840 --> 37:38.258
emotionally, physically.

37:38.675 --> 37:40.468
Just make sure
you exercise violence with it.

37:40.552 --> 37:42.053
You got to get mad
at this thing.

37:42.303 --> 37:44.180
-Grab it. Just--
-(gun rattling)

37:44.222 --> 37:47.517
'Cause you're-- you know?
Every time.

37:47.559 --> 37:49.352
Nora:
Every time I get frustrated

37:49.394 --> 37:51.229
or something happens,

37:51.312 --> 37:54.232
the self-doubt, you know,
I just feel it like, uh,

37:54.816 --> 37:57.694
someone coming up behind me
ready to grab me.

37:58.153 --> 38:01.072
I just felt like
I can't breathe at all.

38:01.114 --> 38:02.323
(gunshot)

38:02.741 --> 38:04.325
Sgt. Franklin:
I need to take Allen
off to the side.

38:05.201 --> 38:09.581
I-I literally had to start
building her from square one.

38:09.664 --> 38:13.376
With firearms, it's literally
like 95 percent mental, okay?

38:13.418 --> 38:15.045
Give me one good shot.

38:15.253 --> 38:16.588
(gunshot)

38:16.921 --> 38:18.048
It's a little bit low.

38:18.256 --> 38:19.549
Start saying out loud,
"Front sight."

38:20.091 --> 38:21.426
-Nora: Front sight.
-Sgt. Franklin: Keep saying it.

38:21.509 --> 38:23.428
Front sight. Front sight.

38:23.470 --> 38:25.555
Front sight. Front sight.

38:25.597 --> 38:26.765
(gunshot)

38:27.098 --> 38:29.642
You're dipping.
Keep saying it.

38:29.726 --> 38:33.563
Nora: Front sight.
Front sight. Front sight.

38:45.450 --> 38:46.409
Sgt. Williams:
He didn't show up.

38:46.451 --> 38:47.452
Lt. Kee:
He didn't show up today?

38:47.535 --> 38:48.912
Sgt. Williams:
He didn't come in today.

38:48.953 --> 38:49.954
Lt. Kee:
Okay.

38:49.996 --> 38:51.164
So is he quitting?

38:51.539 --> 38:53.625
(speaking Navajo)

38:53.708 --> 38:57.045
You want to call him
and figure this out?

38:57.337 --> 38:58.630
I'll give him a call.

38:59.214 --> 39:00.048
Alright.

39:00.131 --> 39:01.132
Uh...

39:01.216 --> 39:03.593
are you wanting
to stay in this program?

39:05.303 --> 39:06.596
Okay.

39:07.972 --> 39:08.765
Alright.

39:08.807 --> 39:10.600
So let me talk
to the commander,

39:10.642 --> 39:12.852
and I'll get back with you.

39:21.277 --> 39:23.780
Why did Hardy leave?
I, I don't know.

39:24.322 --> 39:26.408
Only Hardy knows why he left.

39:28.326 --> 39:29.786
Everybody thought
this is the guy

39:29.828 --> 39:31.454
who's gonna
make it through.

39:31.788 --> 39:34.541
He doesn't seem to be
really having any problems.

39:35.166 --> 39:38.586
Because of that, I didn't think
he'd be easily broken.

39:39.921 --> 39:41.589
So the class took that
really hard

39:41.673 --> 39:43.008
'cause, uh, some
of them were like,

39:43.049 --> 39:46.594
"If that guy's dropping out,
what chance do I have?"

39:55.145 --> 39:57.063
Antwan: Yeah, it was
a big shock to everybody

39:57.147 --> 39:58.606
'cause they didn't know
he left.

39:58.982 --> 40:00.233
I thought he was okay.

40:00.442 --> 40:02.360
(kid speaking indistinctly)

40:02.402 --> 40:04.237
I thought he was okay,
but, um...

40:04.529 --> 40:05.864
Andrea:
You can't take those up.

40:05.947 --> 40:08.116
Antwan: So that morning,
I checked the board first,

40:08.199 --> 40:10.368
and I saw his name,
and I was like, what the heck?

40:10.452 --> 40:11.536
-Yeah?
-Antwan: I don't know.

40:11.578 --> 40:13.163
We just all
kind of felt down.

40:13.830 --> 40:16.207
The RTOs said,
"What's wrong with you guys?

40:16.624 --> 40:19.544
You guys are acting some way."
And none of us wanted to talk.

40:19.586 --> 40:20.795
Andrea:
Mm-hmm.

40:20.879 --> 40:22.881
And I was the same way.
I just felt down.

40:22.964 --> 40:25.133
Like, I had
no motivation at all.

40:27.052 --> 40:29.220
And that kind of hurt though,
like, seeing him go,

40:29.262 --> 40:30.847
'cause he had
the ability to do it.

40:31.097 --> 40:35.685
But he just put his head down
and said, no, he's done.

40:37.479 --> 40:39.939
But it was his choice.

40:42.359 --> 40:46.446
-(thunder rumbling)
-(rain pattering)

40:49.741 --> 40:50.992
Sgt. Williams:
Let's go, Largo.

40:51.076 --> 40:52.911
You run like you're
in the fucking Coast Guard.

40:52.994 --> 40:53.703
Let's move.

40:53.745 --> 40:55.080
Sgt. Dan:
Come on, Pettigrew,

40:55.163 --> 40:56.247
pick it up!

40:57.082 --> 40:59.417
Training Officer: Let's go.
ladies. Come on, let's go.

40:59.751 --> 41:01.503
Sgt. Dan: Get in there
and just start right on it.

41:01.586 --> 41:04.005
Sgt. Williams:
Let's go. Don't wait. Move.

41:04.589 --> 41:06.758
Pettigrew, you got
to push yourself.

41:07.592 --> 41:08.927
Sgt. Dan:
Come on, Gray.

41:10.011 --> 41:13.306
Don't look all weak and stuff.
Come on.

41:13.390 --> 41:16.184
(recruits shouting)

41:16.267 --> 41:17.602
Sgt. Dan:
Come on, Roberta.

41:17.977 --> 41:20.563
Come on, keep going,
keep going, keep going.

41:20.605 --> 41:22.023
You got to keep pushing.

41:31.574 --> 41:33.118
(thunder rumbling)

41:33.201 --> 41:35.537
Sgt. Dan:
Come on, Manygoats!

41:39.958 --> 41:41.418
Come on over here
real quick.

41:41.751 --> 41:43.628
You better not fucking show
any of the weakness,

41:43.712 --> 41:45.005
-do you understand?
-Ma'am, yes, ma'am.

41:45.088 --> 41:46.798
Sgt. Dan: Okay, don't show it
in your body.

41:46.881 --> 41:49.551
Don't show it in your movements.
Just fuckin' do it.

41:49.634 --> 41:52.012
Now, get in there.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

41:54.681 --> 41:57.308
Why is staff having to come
in here and motivate you?

41:57.350 --> 41:59.310
Why are you not
motivating each other?

41:59.394 --> 42:00.937
You fucked up.

42:02.355 --> 42:03.523
Everybody else is out there.

42:03.606 --> 42:05.233
Were you eyeballing me,
Pettigrew?

42:05.316 --> 42:06.443
Cheyenne:
Sir, no, sir.

42:06.484 --> 42:07.777
Sgt. Williams:
You better not be.

42:08.236 --> 42:11.114
It's like if I'm not right
on top of you all the time,

42:11.156 --> 42:14.159
you try to get away with stuff
just like a little kid.

42:14.242 --> 42:16.244
Grow up!
This is life and death!

42:16.619 --> 42:18.830
Sgt. Dan:
That's why PT is important.

42:18.872 --> 42:21.624
It's to fuckin' save
your life.

42:21.666 --> 42:23.418
I don't swear all the time,

42:23.460 --> 42:25.503
but when you don't do
what I tell you to do,

42:25.587 --> 42:27.589
I'm gonna be
fuckin' swearing.

42:28.840 --> 42:31.551
So when you're underneath
and you're at the bottom,

42:31.634 --> 42:34.971
you better get
your fuckin' ass up and on top.

42:40.894 --> 42:43.563
Lt. Kee: And so it's been
an interesting week for us.

42:43.646 --> 42:45.023
So we'll start
with the Academy report.

42:45.106 --> 42:48.651
We had, uh, recruits quitting
for different reasons.

42:48.693 --> 42:52.989
One recruit, the guy that was
nervous and stressed out.

42:53.656 --> 42:56.201
And then the recruit
that we had from Window Rock,

42:56.242 --> 42:58.370
he couldn't keep up and he said,
"Yeah, I can't keep up.

42:58.453 --> 42:59.537
This is not gonna
be for me."

43:00.080 --> 43:02.707
Officer 1: Also, I now have
three individuals,

43:02.791 --> 43:04.709
uh, that have submitted
for retirement,

43:04.793 --> 43:08.546
so that's really gonna
hamper us moving into, uh, May.

43:08.588 --> 43:10.715
So please don't kick
any of my recruits out,

43:10.757 --> 43:12.217
I'm going to ask of you.

43:12.258 --> 43:13.510
I'm sort of on edge on that,

43:13.593 --> 43:15.220
and that's what I was
stressing about yesterday

43:15.303 --> 43:16.513
when I heard those numbers.

43:16.554 --> 43:18.556
Um, so please,
let's maintain them.

43:18.598 --> 43:19.766
But the good thing
about it is...

43:19.849 --> 43:21.101
Lt. Kee: I tell
the commanders every week

43:21.184 --> 43:22.727
in the commander's meeting
that we're not trying

43:22.811 --> 43:24.229
to run these kids off.

43:24.521 --> 43:26.564
We've basically done
everything that we can

43:26.648 --> 43:28.066
to try to prepare these kids

43:28.108 --> 43:30.777
for, for what they're gonna
be facing.

43:31.403 --> 43:32.696
And I don't--

43:33.780 --> 43:35.699
I don't know of
any other way to do it.

43:36.574 --> 43:40.120
Um, but everybody
is functioning,

43:41.079 --> 43:42.038
knock on some wood.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.915
-(knocking on console)
-Knock on fake wood.

43:44.374 --> 43:48.962
Mondays typically tends
to be a, uh, a bad news day

43:49.838 --> 43:52.090
for something that occurred
over the weekend.

43:56.511 --> 44:01.266
-(wind gusting)
-(flag fluttering)

44:19.951 --> 44:21.202
Sgt. Williams:
Good morning, Lieutenant.

44:22.912 --> 44:24.456
I wanna, I wanna do
a quick assessment

44:24.539 --> 44:25.707
before we actually talk.

44:25.790 --> 44:27.834
Was your weekend good?
Is your morning good?

44:30.628 --> 44:33.214
Okay. Well,
I'm-I'm about to...

44:39.262 --> 44:44.851
So we're gonna be
releasing Pettigrew.

44:46.811 --> 44:49.814
Back on the 25th,

44:50.565 --> 44:54.027
Sergeant Dan received
a call from a lady

44:54.110 --> 44:56.279
claiming to be
Cheyenne's Pettigrew's mother.

44:56.321 --> 44:58.698
She'd said that her grandfather
was very sick

44:58.782 --> 45:02.035
and that she needed Cheyenne
to come home.

45:02.118 --> 45:04.329
So we, we cut her loose,
you know,

45:04.412 --> 45:05.955
"Go take care of your family."

45:06.831 --> 45:11.753
And then an old boyfriend,
who's also a police officer,

45:11.836 --> 45:14.547
received a receipt from Uber,

45:14.798 --> 45:16.508
showing that
she was dropped off,

45:16.549 --> 45:18.301
I think it's Allegiant Stadium
is what it's called,

45:18.343 --> 45:20.679
the big venue in Las Vegas,
Friday night.

45:21.096 --> 45:22.972
We brought her in, said,
"Look, we got these receipts.

45:23.014 --> 45:26.351
You need to be honest with us.
What happened that day?"

45:26.518 --> 45:28.019
She just told us, "Yeah,

45:28.103 --> 45:30.814
"I had spent $400
on Metallica tickets

45:30.897 --> 45:32.732
some time ago, and I wanted
to see the concert."

45:32.816 --> 45:34.818
So she colluded
with a friend

45:34.859 --> 45:36.736
to make up the story
about her grandfather

45:37.112 --> 45:40.323
so she could go see Metallica.

45:44.411 --> 45:46.746
So, um...

45:55.130 --> 45:56.965
Talked to the chief
of police.

45:57.048 --> 45:59.718
We're gonna attach the facts

45:59.801 --> 46:03.179
outlining the egregious
misconduct to your file.

46:03.888 --> 46:05.724
Now, in this way,

46:06.266 --> 46:08.727
you may be eligible
for other employment

46:08.810 --> 46:10.645
within the Navajo Nation,

46:10.729 --> 46:12.856
just not within NDPS.

46:13.982 --> 46:15.483
-Okay?
-Cheyenne: Yes, sir.

46:15.567 --> 46:17.569
Sgt. Williams:
So, um...

46:21.573 --> 46:24.325
(solemn music playing)

46:37.922 --> 46:39.883
I hope that was
a good concert.

46:41.926 --> 46:43.303
(Sgt. Dan sighs)

46:44.429 --> 46:45.889
(blows nose)

46:50.518 --> 46:55.106
There's nothing really emotional
about losing Pettigrew.

46:57.609 --> 46:59.861
I wouldn't want somebody on,

46:59.944 --> 47:02.530
with the Navajo
Police Department like that.

47:09.913 --> 47:12.457
We live in a glass case.

47:15.126 --> 47:17.170
People are watching
what we do,

47:18.546 --> 47:19.589
what we say.

47:21.383 --> 47:24.594
So we just have
to be careful all the time.

47:29.808 --> 47:31.142
(engine starts)

47:36.898 --> 47:38.817
Sgt. Williams: I really thought
this was the 14

47:38.900 --> 47:40.527
we were gonna graduate.

47:40.944 --> 47:42.487
Now we're down to 13.

47:45.573 --> 47:47.200
Think about what you're doing.

47:48.660 --> 47:50.245
Think about what's important.

47:54.499 --> 47:55.458
Sgt. Foster:
I-it sucks.

47:55.500 --> 47:56.918
I mean, it hurts us

47:57.002 --> 47:59.087
out in the field
because less manpower.

48:00.755 --> 48:03.008
You see a lot of potential
in some of these new options

48:03.049 --> 48:05.468
that go in to the academy,

48:05.510 --> 48:07.679
and, you know,
it kind of makes you wonder

48:07.721 --> 48:08.763
like, "Hey, what happened?

48:08.847 --> 48:10.432
"I mean, is there something

48:10.515 --> 48:11.433
"that we need to change?

48:11.516 --> 48:12.851
"Is there something that needs
to be changed

48:12.934 --> 48:13.935
out there?"

48:14.019 --> 48:15.603
(indistinct radio chatter)

48:15.854 --> 48:19.190
It just, it makes you wonder
a lot of things.

48:19.232 --> 48:20.942
Seeing the rise
of domestic violence,

48:21.026 --> 48:23.695
seeing the rise
in intoxicated people,

48:23.945 --> 48:25.613
it's overwhelming.

48:28.700 --> 48:29.534
(man groans)

48:29.576 --> 48:31.494
Sgt. Foster:
Sir, Navajo Police, wake up.

48:32.037 --> 48:34.080
Are you gonna be okay
the rest of the night?

48:35.957 --> 48:39.544
Ronald Silversmith:
Some of the modern-day
monsters that exist,

48:39.794 --> 48:41.629
you know, alcoholism,

48:41.880 --> 48:45.342
domestic violence, homicides,

48:45.717 --> 48:47.510
those are things
that are uncommon

48:47.552 --> 48:49.554
o-of Navajo way of life.

48:51.306 --> 48:53.516
This is what
our elders talked about,

48:53.558 --> 48:55.185
the foretold stories.

48:55.810 --> 49:00.273
Remember when the twin warriors
slayed the giant monster?

49:00.357 --> 49:03.151
He shouted out, "I'm gonna
take your language away.

49:03.234 --> 49:04.944
I'm gonna take
your culture away."

49:05.236 --> 49:08.615
Well, we were removed
from our homelands

49:08.698 --> 49:10.408
by the federal government.

49:10.450 --> 49:14.079
Our people were told
to forget our way of life.

49:14.496 --> 49:18.625
Our children were put
into boarding schools.

49:19.209 --> 49:21.878
They told us not to speak
our own language.

49:21.920 --> 49:23.755
"We're gonna wash
your mouth with soap."

49:23.838 --> 49:25.924
(indistinct mumbling)

49:26.091 --> 49:27.634
Silversmith:
There's still a lot of trauma

49:27.717 --> 49:30.011
from that experience.

49:30.095 --> 49:32.681
There's still monsters
that move about

49:33.098 --> 49:35.433
between our four
sacred mountains.

49:36.685 --> 49:40.105
So we remind our officers,
you wear the badge,

49:40.146 --> 49:42.107
but that doesn't mean
that you're immune

49:42.148 --> 49:45.026
to a lot of these monsters
that we're fighting.

49:46.111 --> 49:48.405
(Dispatcher over radio)

49:57.372 --> 49:59.249
230, do we have a name
on the 37

49:59.290 --> 50:01.292
that's unconscious
and not responding?

50:07.590 --> 50:08.633
Fuck.

50:10.969 --> 50:12.512
10-4, code two.

50:13.763 --> 50:15.682
(indistinct radio chatter)

50:15.765 --> 50:17.267
That's my, uh...

50:19.894 --> 50:21.146
older brother.

50:23.231 --> 50:24.649
He's just a bad drinker.

50:28.403 --> 50:32.282
(siren wailing)

50:41.124 --> 50:42.167
Sgt. Dan:
Go inside.

50:42.375 --> 50:44.085
Class:
(indistinct) ma'am.

50:50.759 --> 50:51.509
Sgt. Williams:
What's up?

50:51.593 --> 50:53.011
Shawvan:
I wanted to inform you guys

50:53.094 --> 50:54.179
on the uniforms.

50:54.262 --> 50:55.555
Sgt. Williams:
Okay.

50:55.638 --> 50:56.765
Shawvan:
My pants.

50:56.848 --> 50:59.017
I didn't get them hemmed
just yet

50:59.059 --> 51:01.478
because I thought
we were out--

51:01.519 --> 51:03.188
Sgt. Williams: Are you about
to give me an excuse?

51:04.272 --> 51:07.650
Uh, I'm not too sure,
sir, but--

51:07.692 --> 51:09.778
(Sgt. Williams speaking)

51:12.113 --> 51:13.782
I don't know where
your head has been,

51:13.865 --> 51:15.533
but it ain't been here.

51:18.036 --> 51:20.372
You need to get yourself
unfucked pretty quick.

51:22.082 --> 51:24.876
Yes, sir. I was, um,
going to get them hemmed.

51:25.377 --> 51:26.461
Sgt. Williams:
You better get them hemmed.

51:26.544 --> 51:27.962
I don't wanna hear,
"I was gonna."

51:28.213 --> 51:29.547
When are they
gonna be done?

51:30.006 --> 51:32.801
Shawvan: I can get them done
by tonight, sir.

51:34.469 --> 51:36.096
Sgt. Williams:
You want to be here?

51:36.179 --> 51:37.389
Shawvan:
Uh, yes, sir.

51:37.430 --> 51:38.723
Sgt. Williams:
You backing up for?

51:39.099 --> 51:40.600
-Uh...
-Sgt. Williams:
Stay where you're at.

51:40.684 --> 51:42.143
-Yes, sir.
-Sgt. Williams:
You better start acting

51:42.227 --> 51:43.687
like you want to be here.

51:45.063 --> 51:47.732
I don't know what changed
or what happened,

51:47.816 --> 51:50.276
but you're on the fast track,
and now at the very end

51:50.360 --> 51:52.112
you're starting
to crash and burn.

51:53.822 --> 51:54.906
Yes, sir.

52:01.705 --> 52:05.250
(alarm blaring)

52:06.251 --> 52:09.004
Hey! Navajo Police.

52:09.087 --> 52:10.463
(indistinct)
She's the one that did it.

52:10.547 --> 52:11.715
-Stop. Stop. Stop.
-She's the one that did it.

52:11.756 --> 52:13.299
-She has a knife right there.
-Come with me.

52:13.383 --> 52:15.093
-Come with me, sir.
-This is all your fault.

52:15.176 --> 52:16.344
You're gonna jail.

52:16.678 --> 52:18.221
-Shawvan: Come with me.
-Training Officer:
She has a knife!

52:18.304 --> 52:20.974
Turn around. I'm gonna have you
just stay out here, alright?

52:21.474 --> 52:23.435
I'm Shawvan Levi
with Navajo Police.

52:23.518 --> 52:24.436
What's going on?

52:24.519 --> 52:28.606
He's always hitting me
and pushing me around.

52:28.648 --> 52:30.316
So I-I don't want
to live anymore.

52:30.400 --> 52:31.818
I want to kill myself.

52:33.111 --> 52:36.364
(clears throat)
Okay, so right now,

52:37.365 --> 52:39.826
if this is just, this is--

52:39.909 --> 52:42.495
Training Officer:
Aren't you gonna help me?
How are you gonna help me?

52:42.787 --> 52:45.290
Shawvan: Why don't you
lower down the knife,
just lower the knife,

52:45.373 --> 52:46.958
it's just you and--
you and me in here talking.

52:47.042 --> 52:48.251
I'm tired of living.

52:48.418 --> 52:50.795
I'm tired of him hitting me
all the time.

52:50.837 --> 52:53.006
He's not going to be hitting you
right now, okay?

52:53.089 --> 52:55.425
It's just you
and I talking, okay?

52:56.718 --> 53:00.055
Sgt. Dan:
Alright. So domestic violence.

53:00.388 --> 53:02.891
Growing up, how many
of you guys

53:02.974 --> 53:07.395
witnessed anything at all
like o-on domestic violence?

53:11.983 --> 53:13.068
There's quite a few.

53:13.651 --> 53:16.321
And look at this,
it's like 10 times more

53:16.363 --> 53:18.031
than the national average

53:18.114 --> 53:20.367
on Native American reservations.

53:20.909 --> 53:24.412
It is a community problem
which impacts everyone.

53:24.704 --> 53:26.498
Training Officer 1:
Fuck you, bitch.
I'm tired of your shit.

53:26.581 --> 53:27.957
Training Officer 2:
Don't push me.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.461
(both shouting)

53:31.836 --> 53:32.587
Let's just drop the knife.

53:32.671 --> 53:34.130
Let's talk about
this real quick.

53:34.464 --> 53:37.217
Sgt. Dan: Without intervention,
it will repeat itself

53:37.300 --> 53:40.053
and be learned
by the next generation.

53:40.553 --> 53:42.472
-Physical abuse.
-Tso-Tapahanso: Go.

53:42.514 --> 53:44.015
-Sgt. Dan: Pushing.
-Nora: Get back.

53:44.057 --> 53:45.392
Back, back, back.

53:45.475 --> 53:46.685
Antwan:
Get back.

53:46.726 --> 53:48.520
-Sgt. Dan: Kicking.
-Antwan: Get back.

53:48.561 --> 53:51.272
-(fighters grunting)
-Sgt. Dan: Punching.

53:51.356 --> 53:52.607
Sgt. Dan:
Restraining.

53:52.691 --> 53:54.859
Everybody see
the hand placement?

53:54.943 --> 53:56.361
Sgt. Dan:
Using weapons.

53:57.112 --> 53:59.447
(gunfire)

53:59.864 --> 54:02.367
Sgt. Dan: And it's not just
the physical part of it.

54:02.409 --> 54:05.954
Emotional
and psychological abuse...

54:05.995 --> 54:07.664
-(siren wailing)
-(officers yelling)

54:07.706 --> 54:09.541
Sgt. Dan:
...intimidation...

54:10.166 --> 54:13.545
(officers yelling)

54:13.628 --> 54:14.963
Sgt. Dan:
...yelling,

54:16.464 --> 54:17.924
demeaning remarks.

54:18.008 --> 54:20.135
Training Officer:
Let's go, you little bitch.

54:20.218 --> 54:21.720
Sgt. Dan:
Humiliation.

54:21.803 --> 54:23.430
-Where's your belly?
-Recruit: Right here, sir.

54:23.513 --> 54:25.056
Pet your belly.
Rub your head.

54:25.390 --> 54:28.059
Every day, they're told
they're worthless.

54:28.518 --> 54:30.478
They can't do anything right.

54:30.562 --> 54:34.024
Dump them out!
You took too long!

54:34.441 --> 54:36.234
Sgt. Dan:
Children witnessing DV,

54:36.317 --> 54:37.944
seeing it over and over

54:38.028 --> 54:39.988
throughout their,
their childhood,

54:40.071 --> 54:44.200
the emotional trauma,
it affects their brain.

54:44.909 --> 54:46.745
Sgt. Williams: Why are you
so nervous this morning?

54:48.038 --> 54:49.831
Sir, I don't know, sir.

54:50.373 --> 54:52.500
Sgt. Dan:
Common victim
characteristics:

54:52.959 --> 54:54.419
fear.

54:55.503 --> 54:57.297
Why are you
not breathing, Damon?

54:57.714 --> 54:59.924
-Why are you so nervous?
-(exhales forcefully)

55:03.303 --> 55:04.721
Sgt. Dan:
Shame.

55:04.888 --> 55:06.973
Guys, look at him and wave.

55:07.307 --> 55:08.558
Class:
Goodbye!

55:08.600 --> 55:10.769
Sgt. Dan:
Low self-esteem.

55:11.770 --> 55:12.979
Damn.

55:16.649 --> 55:18.943
Sgt. Dan:
Being insecure.

55:19.152 --> 55:20.945
Sgt. Williams:
Breathe. Breathe, Allen.

55:20.987 --> 55:22.781
Sgt. Dan: They don't know
how to deal with stress

55:22.864 --> 55:24.157
and frustration.

55:24.240 --> 55:25.408
(gunshot)

55:25.742 --> 55:27.077
Sgt. Williams:
You're still going high.

55:27.118 --> 55:29.621
Often children
of domestic violence

55:30.080 --> 55:32.040
handle conflict
with aggression.

55:32.248 --> 55:33.458
Officer:
Open the door!

55:33.500 --> 55:34.876
-Speaker: Fuck out of here.
-Officer: Come out!

55:35.126 --> 55:38.463
Sgt. Dan: Their response
to taking care of a situation

55:38.546 --> 55:40.256
is also violence.

55:40.548 --> 55:41.966
Officer:
Put your hands up!

55:42.133 --> 55:43.343
Speaker:
Fuck you.

55:43.551 --> 55:46.971
So it's just a cycle,
goes in a circle.

55:47.013 --> 55:48.932
Navajo Police. Can you sit up
for me, man?

55:48.973 --> 55:52.811
Sgt. Dan: Lack of
or loss of employment.

55:52.852 --> 55:54.396
Sgt. Foster: All the alcohol's
underneath that bed,

55:54.479 --> 55:55.855
need all that dumped out.

55:56.272 --> 55:58.650
Sgt. Dan:
High risk for substance abuse,

55:58.983 --> 56:01.069
that's their way of coping.

56:03.238 --> 56:06.157
DV is not anger-driven.

56:06.241 --> 56:08.785
It is power and control.

56:09.911 --> 56:11.121
Isolation.

56:11.996 --> 56:16.001
A lot of avenues or ways
of escape for the victim

56:16.042 --> 56:17.836
is just cut off.

56:19.170 --> 56:20.797
Economic dependency.

56:20.839 --> 56:25.010
And so all of the funding
that comes down from Congress,

56:25.051 --> 56:26.678
it goes to the BIA.

56:26.761 --> 56:29.347
Sgt. Dan: They can't do
anything financially

56:29.389 --> 56:32.017
without the perpetrator.

56:32.684 --> 56:34.561
Everything has
to go through them.

56:35.562 --> 56:38.064
Common abuser
characteristics.

56:38.940 --> 56:42.527
Believes they are better
and different than others.

56:43.319 --> 56:47.323
No part of the violence that
they inflict on their victim

56:47.365 --> 56:49.200
is their fault.

56:50.326 --> 56:52.662
Avoids facts.

56:52.704 --> 56:55.081
Will show them a picture

56:55.165 --> 56:58.043
or statements
from victims...

56:58.126 --> 56:59.210
(training officer yells)

56:59.502 --> 57:03.631
Sgt. Dan:
...and they still won't
believe it's their fault.

57:05.008 --> 57:08.261
They will have blood
on their hands,

57:08.345 --> 57:09.804
and they'll say,

57:10.305 --> 57:13.391
"That's not me.
I wouldn't do that."

57:13.433 --> 57:17.228
(flag fluttering)

57:24.152 --> 57:29.074
(somber music playing)

57:54.474 --> 57:58.728
