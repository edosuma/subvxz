01:54.480 --> 01:55.480
Percy!

01:56.440 --> 01:57.873
Look at him with his horse.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.068
Wave to your father.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.594
Gentlemen!

02:04.680 --> 02:07.672
Today, I will be delivered
to the Archduke Ferdinand at the gala.

02:08.680 --> 02:11.752
I expect you to behave
with distinction on this hunt.

02:11.840 --> 02:12.840
Good luck...

02:13.800 --> 02:14.994
and Godspeed.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.520
Could they not fit you a rocking chair
on that horse, grandad?

02:18.040 --> 02:20.076
You'll all be my gun bearers by evening.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.269
I've no doubt of that.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.196
Keep up there! Keep up there!

03:20.200 --> 03:22.350
Major, there's no path there!

03:23.240 --> 03:25.515
Major! Major!

03:38.840 --> 03:39.840
Good boy.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.229
You caught him?

03:54.960 --> 03:56.359
Superb horsemanship, Major.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.759
Excellent shot, sir.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.115
These woods have been deadly to horses.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.268
To Death;

04:04.960 --> 04:06.598
the best source to Life.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.559
You'll be the toast of the gala.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.709
Here they come.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.759
Oh, he's triumphant!

04:14.600 --> 04:16.430
- Daddy did it!
- Come here, you.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.709
- Daddy!
- Well done, Daddy.

04:20.079 --> 04:22.674
Someday, you and I
will go hunting together.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.632
We're going to be late.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.154
Oh, God, it's this damn thing.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.439
You must be so pleased
with yourselves. You, men.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.516
Making us wear these awful things.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.318
At least you're not wearing trousers.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.188
Oh, I would if I could.

05:12.760 --> 05:13.760
I know.

05:15.560 --> 05:16.560
Well?

05:18.320 --> 05:19.320
Rather lovely.

05:19.920 --> 05:20.920
"Rather lovely."

05:22.560 --> 05:24.118
What is it? What's amiss?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.553
You've got the deer.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.432
All eyes will be on you this evening.

05:28.760 --> 05:34.357
Well, my darling, I will be the only man
there tonight, of my rank,

05:35.360 --> 05:37.590
whose uniform is unadorned.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.398
How can that matter now?

05:39.840 --> 05:43.355
The great Secretary Bryce
will be at the gala.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.716
Oh, Ms. Fawcett.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.473
You've no medals.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.234
"Oh, no, Mr. Bryce.
You see, I've been terribly busy

05:51.320 --> 05:54.596
teaching ancient militiamen to
point their rifles at tree stumps, so...

05:55.080 --> 05:56.080
No, no.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.232
No medals for me, sir."

06:02.400 --> 06:03.400
Tell me.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.556
Who's this Secretary Bryce
when he's at home?

06:09.680 --> 06:14.356
The last man here upon whom we might
possibly rely for advancement.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.560
I see.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.478
I'm getting older, cheeky,

06:21.800 --> 06:24.439
and very impatient of lost years.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.478
I know the medals are ridiculous. I do.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.157
But this may be our final chance.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.776
Secretary Bryce,
this is Major Fawcett.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.392
- Major.
- It's an honor, sir.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.480
Honor's mine, sir.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.151
Good to meet you. Meet Secretary Bryce;
Secretary Bryce, Madame Bellamy.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.035
Major and Mrs. Percy Fawcett.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.080
They're toasting
the kill without you.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.674
...this most magnificent animal...

07:20.360 --> 07:23.272
Well, I am dancing with you,
so I've got the better of the bargain.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.158
May I, Major?

07:27.880 --> 07:28.880
Spoken too soon.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.200
Come.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.832
By the way, who got the kill?

07:40.720 --> 07:43.632
Oh, that would be
Major Fawcett, Mr. Secretary.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.917
Well, we should invite him to supper.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.800
Oh..

07:48.320 --> 07:50.038
Well, may I say...

07:50.120 --> 07:54.796
he's been rather unfortunate
in his choice of ancestors.

07:55.960 --> 07:56.960
I see.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.320
Well, then...

07:59.040 --> 08:01.508
Tell me. How is Lady...

08:32.480 --> 08:34.471
No more than 20 cases, Clive.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.999
Hurry along, men. Come on!

08:37.120 --> 08:38.296
Come on. Put your back into it.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.231
- Fawcett!
- Put your backs into it.

08:41.880 --> 08:42.995
Hurry it along.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.550
- Sir.
- You're off to London tomorrow,

08:50.640 --> 08:52.949
to the Royal Geographical Society.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.319
The Royal Geographical, sir?

08:56.040 --> 08:57.951
There's a major exploration afoot.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.038
Sounds like a grand adventure.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.040
Thank you, sir.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.240
Thank you.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.748
Major Fawcett, sir.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.836
Oh, yes, yes. Come in.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.879
Absent George Goldie,
president of the RGS,

09:56.440 --> 09:59.318
this is Mr. John Scott Keltie,
our secretary.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.549
How do you do, Major?

10:00.640 --> 10:01.640
How do you do, sir?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.069
Our paths have not crossed

10:03.160 --> 10:05.879
during our work here
several years back, did they?

10:06.440 --> 10:07.440
They did not, sir.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.634
I was likely consumed
with my studies at the time.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.275
Of course.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.271
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

10:16.480 --> 10:20.439
Ah! The army seems to have
posted you in many places in the path.

10:21.160 --> 10:24.789
Yes, I've served in Salon
and in Hong Kong before that;

10:25.240 --> 10:26.992
most recently in lreland.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.310
As you can see, I've been transferred
a fair bit around the Empire.

10:34.440 --> 10:37.716
Major, what do you know about Bolivia?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.636
- In South America, sir?
- That's right.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.440
Only what I've read.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.556
Hmm. Then you can't know very much.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.117
This is as good a map
of Bolivia as we have.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.431
Map's a bit blank as you can see.
Nothing's really known about it at all.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.159
A land of primitives.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.356
But there are rubber plantations
all over Amazonia.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.355
Very profitable.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.834
There is now considerable argument
between Bolivia and Brazil

11:06.920 --> 11:08.876
as to what constitutes their border.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.238
So fantastically high
is the price of rubber,

11:12.600 --> 11:14.670
that war could arise.

11:15.560 --> 11:16.560
Do you follow?

11:18.600 --> 11:19.828
- I do, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.274
Although, I'm not sure what this
has to do with me.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.958
I'm getting to that.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.997
Neither country will accept
mapping done by the other,

11:30.080 --> 11:34.437
so they've requested us to act as referee.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.918
- Mm.
- As you've completed your mapping here...

11:38.000 --> 11:41.993
with distinction.
You came under our consideration.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.275
- I see.
- Mm-hmm.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.153
Sirs, may I speak candidly?

11:50.240 --> 11:51.240
Please.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.270
My survey work was long ago.

11:56.680 --> 11:59.797
And to be quite honest,
I was rather hoping for a position

11:59.880 --> 12:01.677
where I might see a fair bit of action.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.760
Major.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.192
This is far more than just survey work!

12:07.160 --> 12:09.594
This is exploration in the jungle.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.118
The environment's brutally difficult.

12:13.320 --> 12:14.639
Terrible disease.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.228
Murderous savages.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.436
The journey may well mean your life.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.793
At the very least,
you will be gone for several years.

12:22.520 --> 12:25.990
But were you to succeed,
such an undertaking

12:26.080 --> 12:28.640
could earn you soldierly decoration.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.680
And...

12:31.040 --> 12:33.190
even reclaim your family name.

12:35.240 --> 12:37.276
You know we knew your father.

12:40.840 --> 12:41.840
Did you?

12:43.400 --> 12:44.400
Yes.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.440
I did not.

12:47.840 --> 12:48.840
Terrible thing.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.079
Man's love of drink and gaming.

12:53.200 --> 12:57.637
But as I say, success in this venture
could change your lot...

12:59.400 --> 13:00.435
considerably.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.788
How come I've never seen
a plain change color?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Like that.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.429
Does it look big, like a big brain?

13:16.240 --> 13:17.240
It looks round.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.235
- It looks round in that doesn't it?
- It does.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.639
Jack, will you go and play?

13:24.600 --> 13:26.352
I want to talk to
your father for a minute.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.238
Do you want to pick me a flower?

13:29.640 --> 13:31.198
Uh... Ooh...

13:31.600 --> 13:33.556
- Shall I throw the ball for her?
- Yeah.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.560
Ready?

13:38.200 --> 13:39.110
Steady.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.200
Throw it that way.

13:43.160 --> 13:44.160
Throw it that far!

13:47.280 --> 13:49.714
Oh, I knew it!

13:52.160 --> 13:53.673
Hey, it's all wet.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.593
He'll not know you when you return.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.152
But you must go. I know that.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.072
Indeed.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.268
I have something to tell you.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.796
I think I'm going to have another child.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.679
I know I'm having another child.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.080
Don't be sad.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.399
I'm an independent woman.

14:32.640 --> 14:33.834
I hadn't noticed.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.549
Cheeky... Darling...

14:40.280 --> 14:42.669
I know this is a sacrifice for all of us.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.674
But it will be worth it.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.475
I have no doubt.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.028
Come here.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.113
Cut you bloody throat!

16:14.720 --> 16:15.789
...you're a dead man!

17:08.240 --> 17:09.240
Who are you?

17:09.720 --> 17:10.789
What do you want?

17:11.359 --> 17:12.474
Henry Costin.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.277
I replied to your ad eleven times.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.234
I'm your aide-de-camp.

17:18.280 --> 17:19.280
Mr. Costin?

17:19.599 --> 17:20.635
What are my duties, sir?

17:21.800 --> 17:25.792
We've been at sea a week.
Why are you just presenting yourself now?

17:26.160 --> 17:28.674
I wanted to make sure
you were up to the task, sir.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.713
Are you drunk, Mr. Costin?

17:32.800 --> 17:33.800
No.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.068
You could've fooled me.

17:35.720 --> 17:36.720
Well...

17:37.440 --> 17:38.475
Well...

17:38.560 --> 17:39.788
I might have had a little.

17:42.880 --> 17:43.880
I've got a...

17:44.320 --> 17:45.320
letter of commendation.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.192
They say I'm both skilled
at rifle and pistols...

17:51.680 --> 17:52.680
and for bravery.

17:53.880 --> 17:54.880
That's very impressive.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.280
You have a family?

17:57.840 --> 17:58.909
No, none at all.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.395
I see; so nothing to shed.

18:03.720 --> 18:04.869
I take it you do then.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.238
Mr. Costin, I would like to be clear.

18:10.320 --> 18:14.199
My reputation as a man
rests entirely on our success.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.152
I think you shall find me
capable of every sacrifice.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.751
Therefore, I must insist.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.268
Oh! Right you are, sir.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.031
We'll need all the fortitude you've got.

18:33.720 --> 18:34.720
Understood.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.471
We are explorers now.

18:56.440 --> 18:57.919
I just received a cable.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.832
We have new orders to map the Verde River,

19:01.920 --> 19:03.717
- Please!
- find its source.

19:05.240 --> 19:08.516
It forms a critical part of the border
between Bolivia and Brazil.

19:09.680 --> 19:13.719
Our survey route is to begin
at a place called Fazenda Jacobina,

19:13.840 --> 19:15.671
which does not appear to be on this map.

19:16.360 --> 19:17.395
I know Facenda Jacobina.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.872
It's an old rubber town.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.320
It's meant to be quite enchanting.

19:21.880 --> 19:22.710
Really?

19:22.800 --> 19:25.075
You may not be
completely useless after all.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.352
Time is of the essence now.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.155
War's at stake.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.677
So you, and I, and a couple of mules

19:33.760 --> 19:34.875
are gonna stop a war?

19:36.040 --> 19:37.393
Well then you and I...

19:37.680 --> 19:39.591
are going to have to
depend on each other.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.596
Neither of us will survive this alone.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.520
Right you are.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.715
What's that you're reading?

19:50.360 --> 19:52.828
Poem, from my wife, by Kipling.

19:53.720 --> 19:54.994
It's called "The Explorer."

19:55.680 --> 19:56.874
And what?

19:58.080 --> 19:59.229
Would you like to hear it?

20:00.240 --> 20:02.913
It'll be a long way
until we reach Amazonia.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Be my guest.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.629
"'There's no sense in going further;
it's the edge of cultivation, '

20:11.280 --> 20:13.589
So they said, and I believed it;

20:14.160 --> 20:16.230
broke my land and sowed my crop;

20:17.120 --> 20:19.190
Built my barns and strung my fences..."

20:19.320 --> 20:20.958
"...in the little border station

20:21.920 --> 20:26.311
Tucked away below the foothills
where the trails run out and stop.

20:28.320 --> 20:33.599
Till a voice, as bad as Conscience,
rang interminable changes

20:33.680 --> 20:37.639
On one everlasting Whisper
day and night repeated; so:

20:39.400 --> 20:40.515
'Something hidden.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.520
Go and find it.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.271
Go and look behind the Ranges;

20:46.440 --> 20:48.829
Something lost behind the Ranges.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.599
Lost and waiting for you.

20:52.840 --> 20:53.840
Go!"'

21:43.440 --> 21:44.589
Twenty-nine degrees.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.430
Sixteen minutes south of the equator.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.600
Twenty-nine.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.560
Sixt...

21:54.680 --> 21:55.795
Sixteen.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.558
Rather deadly looking snake here.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.349
We might be a little bit
too English for this jungle.

22:13.960 --> 22:15.598
Strangers in a strange land.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.680
Major Fawcett.

23:52.760 --> 23:53.760
Is that you?

23:54.880 --> 23:56.996
- Yes.
- Welcome to Fazenda Jacobina.

23:58.280 --> 24:00.416
Lance Corporal Manley, sir,
liaison to the government of Japanese...

24:00.440 --> 24:01.839
You start on ceremony.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.439
A simple handshake will suffice.

24:04.760 --> 24:05.875
This is Mr. Costin.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.317
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

24:09.120 --> 24:11.759
but I have received a telegram
from the border commission.

24:12.960 --> 24:13.960
Go on.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.673
They strongly advise you to...

24:16.680 --> 24:17.715
abort the mission.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.279
It's become far too dangerous.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.280
- They've already fired...
- Where are the government offices?

24:23.360 --> 24:24.360
Sir...

24:26.080 --> 24:27.080
Government, sir?

24:29.280 --> 24:31.794
I'm afraid you left government behind
a long time ago.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.115
In that case, you'd better
send them a telegram.

24:37.320 --> 24:40.153
Informing them that
we will not stand down,

24:40.240 --> 24:42.390
and we shall proceed as planned.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.796
How quickly can you
find us an lndian guide?

24:46.640 --> 24:47.640
Well, I...

24:48.000 --> 24:49.592
I had an lndian guide sir, but...

24:51.800 --> 24:52.869
But what happened to him?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.116
What? Was he afraid of a little hard work?

24:59.040 --> 25:00.040
Not quite, sir.

25:00.680 --> 25:01.874
It's out of my hands now.

25:02.400 --> 25:06.029
You need to speak to Baron De Gondoriz.
He runs the rubber company here.

25:07.920 --> 25:10.229
Good evening, Baron.
Thank you for seeing us.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.158
We are from the British Army.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.236
We're to be venturing up the Rio Verde,

25:16.960 --> 25:19.030
and find ourselves in need
of some of your men.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.913
In exchange, I promise very favorable
treatment from my country.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.473
Keep him chained up.
He can't be trusted.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.509
He needs a good beatin'
every now and again.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.148
Por favor.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.353
You goin' up river, are you?

25:53.440 --> 25:54.440
Yes.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
We're surveying.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.800
Well...

25:59.520 --> 26:01.556
Ain't nobody comes back from up there.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.800
Ever.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.798
Is this slave good enough for you?

26:10.640 --> 26:11.640
Yes.

26:14.520 --> 26:15.680
Do you speak English?

26:15.760 --> 26:16.875
He understands.

26:17.800 --> 26:18.800
We taught him.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.990
What will you take for him?
And any four men of his choosing?

26:27.400 --> 26:29.675
It offends you to negotiate with me.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.560
- No, not at all.
- Please.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.114
Do not embarrass yourself.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.352
You come here to make maps.

26:39.240 --> 26:40.240
Why is that?

26:41.040 --> 26:42.951
So that there may be peace.

26:44.240 --> 26:45.309
What is peace?

26:46.360 --> 26:49.591
Peace means my business would flourish.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.355
I would flourish.

26:52.920 --> 26:53.920
Peace...

26:54.520 --> 26:57.432
means only that nothing will change.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.515
I will help you.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.990
Because you will make sure
that nothing will change.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.440
I forgot to give you this, Major.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.000
It came directly here
while you were surveying.

27:44.720 --> 27:46.392
Can you show me how far the river goes?

28:03.080 --> 28:04.080
Muy bien.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.034
We've three full rafts,
four horses.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.837
This our party?
Bloody desperate lot you've got us.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.518
They're as dependable as any
that can be found here, Mr. Costin.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.198
We're the only ones who will pay them.

28:21.560 --> 28:24.279
Lot will do twelve hours a day; no less.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.469
The river will be our home
for the next two years.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.280
We shall not fail.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.516
Mankind awaits our discoveries.

29:31.280 --> 29:35.831
Have you ever seen a land
Like old El Dorado

29:35.960 --> 29:39.589
Of gold and of silver,
Of gold and of silver

29:39.680 --> 29:43.389
Have you ever seen a land
Like old El Dorado

29:43.480 --> 29:47.359
Of gold and of silver,
And silver and gold

29:48.560 --> 29:49.754
I can see the fish,

29:50.600 --> 29:51.999
but I can't catch them.

30:01.640 --> 30:02.640
Nothing again.

30:03.840 --> 30:04.840
I don't understand.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.950
The river is deep here.
There is plenty of fish.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.435
It's a desert.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.069
A green desert.

30:14.800 --> 30:15.800
All right, pull it in.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.309
Try again further up.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.080
Major Fawcett.

30:25.760 --> 30:28.593
What on earth is she doing
all the way out here?

30:33.320 --> 30:35.072
She's come to load rubber, no doubt.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.400
Or maybe she's looking
for the gold at El Dorado.

30:44.360 --> 30:45.360
It's German.

30:47.680 --> 30:48.908
The trunk says "Hamburg."

30:50.600 --> 30:51.600
Someone aboard.

30:54.760 --> 30:55.760
Hey!

30:56.400 --> 30:57.400
Are you German?

31:18.480 --> 31:20.118
Cosin! The water!

31:21.160 --> 31:22.160
Get out of the water!

31:29.160 --> 31:31.276
Where's Fawcett? Fawcett!

33:39.680 --> 33:40.680
It's nothing.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.389
Are we close?

35:29.080 --> 35:31.196
Even the lndian's gone mad now.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.153
He was talking to me
about gold cities today.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.359
Like a little child.

35:43.480 --> 35:46.711
He thinks we are conquistadors
to be led to our death.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.630
Well, the lndian seemed
a bit mad to begin with.

35:55.080 --> 35:57.230
I'd like you to read this
to me if you can.

35:59.560 --> 36:02.199
If we are to meet our end here,
what difference does it make?

36:07.800 --> 36:10.758
Afraid it would be quite unbearable,
for me to read it myself.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.033
Feel free to summarize.

36:16.280 --> 36:17.395
Right you are, sir.

36:22.720 --> 36:26.030
Your wife has moved the family to Devon.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.273
She's given birth to a boy named Brian.

36:31.600 --> 36:35.718
Your oldest boy, Jack,
is excelling in all ways, she says.

36:58.560 --> 37:01.757
I see my son's face
in my dreams now.

37:09.960 --> 37:13.350
What kind of fool am I,
to leave my family for this place?

37:18.560 --> 37:20.551
What did you hope to achieve out here?

37:24.400 --> 37:25.400
I don't know.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.471
All we have left now is to get
to the source of the river.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Mr. Costin.

38:20.600 --> 38:21.600
Major.

38:23.240 --> 38:24.240
Food gone.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.916
Jesus Christ, we are going
die from hungry.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.280
One piece.

38:36.280 --> 38:37.280
Give me that!

38:39.760 --> 38:41.113
Control yourselves!

38:45.560 --> 38:47.118
We are not savages.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.111
We're leaving our bones here, Major.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.080
And for what?

38:58.320 --> 38:59.320
A map?

39:02.280 --> 39:05.909
Are you gonna forget that
we're not making it back without any food?

39:08.600 --> 39:09.920
Have you ever thought about that?

39:10.960 --> 39:13.269
Well, we're here starving to death.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.233
We're not even looking for gold.

39:18.240 --> 39:19.240
Let's have at it then.

39:22.040 --> 39:25.032
Ah! My ear!

39:25.120 --> 39:26.120
My ear!

39:27.360 --> 39:30.079
- My ear!
- Next one'll be up your ass.

39:32.760 --> 39:34.830
Thank you, Mr. Costin.

39:57.320 --> 39:58.514
Woo!

40:02.680 --> 40:04.557
No one's ever been here before me!

40:05.160 --> 40:06.593
No one! Ever!

40:10.720 --> 40:11.720
We made it!

40:16.120 --> 40:17.120
Woo!

40:19.320 --> 40:22.118
The first! We're the first!

40:22.840 --> 40:23.840
Woo!

40:31.120 --> 40:32.120
Major.

40:34.560 --> 40:35.754
Major, we've lost the lndian.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.200
He's run off.

40:41.760 --> 40:42.829
He got us here.

40:55.480 --> 40:56.480
My last reading.

41:35.680 --> 41:39.992
- Am I dreaming this?
- No. I see it too.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.160
Please.

41:46.360 --> 41:47.679
It's our only chance.

41:48.720 --> 41:49.755
Must have.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.240
Thank God.

42:06.360 --> 42:08.271
Couldn't have done that
better myself, sir.

42:40.840 --> 42:41.840
What is it, chief?

42:45.440 --> 42:46.440
It's pottery.

42:48.320 --> 42:49.320
From the ground.

42:53.880 --> 42:55.029
Look it's all over.

43:03.960 --> 43:04.960
Look at this.

43:06.120 --> 43:07.120
They're ancient.

43:10.680 --> 43:12.113
Christ. He was right.

43:15.720 --> 43:17.073
The lndian was right.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.752
When he said no one had been here before.

43:23.520 --> 43:27.911
I think he meant no white man, Mr. Costin.
I think he meant no white man.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.273
We thought the lndian mad.

43:34.480 --> 43:35.993
There must've been dwellings here.

44:16.120 --> 44:18.395
Thank God that boar's
more meat on it than we do.

44:18.480 --> 44:19.960
All right, easy, easy, easy.

44:22.440 --> 44:25.079
The exit from hell
is always difficult, Mr. Costin.

44:27.400 --> 44:28.799
But we will get back.

44:32.200 --> 44:34.509
The world will know what we've found here.

44:35.240 --> 44:36.440
We have to keep going!

45:37.000 --> 45:38.399
Thank you. Thank you.

45:38.480 --> 45:41.233
Major Fawcett, you are
England's bravest explorer.

45:41.560 --> 45:42.560
Thank you, sir.

45:55.840 --> 45:56.840
Your son.

45:57.320 --> 45:58.514
This must be Brian.

46:03.920 --> 46:04.920
And here's Jack.

46:07.880 --> 46:08.949
Are you my father?

46:10.920 --> 46:12.114
I am, indeed, son.

46:13.800 --> 46:15.358
Come. Give me a hug.

46:24.040 --> 46:25.155
Let's go home.

46:27.320 --> 46:28.320
Thank you all.

46:35.280 --> 46:38.556
Percy, come. Meet our host,
Mr. James Murray.

46:38.640 --> 46:40.392
He's very anxious to meet you.

46:40.920 --> 46:42.797
A person of considerable resources.

46:43.560 --> 46:45.312
He certainly has a beautiful home.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.756
With, of course,
a reputation to match.

46:50.240 --> 46:51.355
Ah, Mr. Murray.

46:52.680 --> 46:54.830
Major Fawcett, I see you down there.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.750
Welcome... to the inner circle.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.194
Thank, Mr. Murray.

47:00.280 --> 47:02.111
- Mrs. Fawcett.
- Good evening.

47:07.400 --> 47:13.316
Percy, they're all so excited
to hear your speech to the RGS.

47:14.080 --> 47:15.229
Listen to them, will you?

47:17.480 --> 47:19.471
They're all talking about your mission.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
Extraordinary.

47:22.720 --> 47:24.153
I'm just honored to be here, sir.

47:25.160 --> 47:27.515
I read your article
in The Times this morning

47:27.600 --> 47:31.752
about the slave trade
in the Americas. It's uh...

47:33.400 --> 47:34.628
You're an enlightened man.

47:35.480 --> 47:36.629
Poor savages.

47:38.440 --> 47:41.273
Native does deserve our sympathy.

47:41.760 --> 47:42.760
Yes.

47:42.960 --> 47:46.270
I think we have only
just scratched the surface of Amazonia.

47:46.720 --> 47:47.948
Most certainly.

47:49.400 --> 47:50.594
I was, um...

47:51.360 --> 47:56.593
Well, I'm a biologist, but I'm also
somewhat of an explorer.

47:56.680 --> 48:00.275
I was second in command under
Shackleton in the Antarctica.

48:00.680 --> 48:01.749
Did you know that?

48:01.840 --> 48:04.513
I don't think there's anyone here
who's not well aware

48:04.600 --> 48:06.238
of your accomplishments, Mr. Murray.

48:06.360 --> 48:07.360
Here, here.

48:08.160 --> 48:10.594
You have distinguished
yourself with great bravery.

48:11.080 --> 48:12.957
I know what these expeditions require.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.670
Well, it's been my lifelong ambition to...

48:17.000 --> 48:18.433
go to the Amazon, you know?

48:20.000 --> 48:24.232
I must say, I hope that the RGS
continues its pursuits,

48:24.640 --> 48:25.640
but I...

48:26.160 --> 48:30.312
I have come to believe that mapmaking
should be a secondary interest.

48:31.840 --> 48:32.840
Really?

48:33.160 --> 48:36.630
I witnessed several
archaeological discoveries

48:37.400 --> 48:40.119
that I believe may have
enormous significance.

48:40.440 --> 48:43.238
- Such as?
- Pottery in the jungle.

48:43.720 --> 48:46.598
Where no white man
has ever been before.

48:46.680 --> 48:48.557
My friend, a word in your ear, please.

48:48.640 --> 48:52.872
Your exploits have opened
every door for you.

48:53.640 --> 48:56.313
I would suggest keeping
such findings to yourself.

48:56.400 --> 48:57.400
Mm-hmm.

48:57.680 --> 49:00.717
It is one thing to defend
the primitive jungle men.

49:00.800 --> 49:04.509
It is quite another to elevate
their capacity beyond reason.

49:04.600 --> 49:09.116
I mean, no one here would dispute
that you believed what you saw, but...

49:10.120 --> 49:11.997
such a trip is very hard on the mind;

49:12.960 --> 49:14.154
very hard, indeed.

49:18.760 --> 49:19.760
Mr. Keltie.

49:21.960 --> 49:24.713
I think you should find
my mind perfectly fit.

49:27.160 --> 49:28.912
And still open, thank heavens.

49:40.600 --> 49:44.559
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Good afternoon.

49:47.320 --> 49:50.312
I would like to introduce
one of our brothers

49:51.000 --> 49:54.072
whose achievements are now known to you

49:54.160 --> 49:56.037
and not inconsiderable.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.230
Major Percy Fawcett.

50:03.520 --> 50:04.520
Thank you, sir.

50:10.800 --> 50:12.711
By rights, I should be with my husband.

50:13.320 --> 50:15.550
It's men only I'm afraid, madam.

50:17.560 --> 50:18.879
My esteemed colleagues,

50:20.800 --> 50:22.791
it is now my firm belief

50:24.040 --> 50:28.033
that Amazonia is far more
than the green desert

50:28.120 --> 50:29.792
which many of us had supposed.

50:32.800 --> 50:36.031
I am proposing that Amazonia...

50:37.120 --> 50:39.759
contain a hidden civilization

50:42.760 --> 50:45.399
One that may well
predate our own.

50:46.520 --> 50:47.669
Major Fawcett!

50:48.160 --> 50:51.038
I am Mr. William Barkley of Bedford,

50:51.120 --> 50:52.917
and I have been to South America.

50:55.280 --> 50:58.556
Please, Mr. Barkley, I'm sure we'd all
be thrilled to hear about your holiday.

51:01.480 --> 51:04.472
But we are currently
discussing exploration.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.120
Now to be clear.

51:09.040 --> 51:12.589
Are you insisting on
mythical kingdoms of gold?

51:12.680 --> 51:15.319
Now, those fantasies

51:15.400 --> 51:18.551
lured the conquistadors
to their destruction.

51:20.400 --> 51:23.836
Sir, it was the conquistadors and we

51:24.280 --> 51:26.396
who have been destroying Amazonia.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.036
I have seen, with my own eyes,

51:30.120 --> 51:32.953
evidence of their civilization.

51:33.040 --> 51:35.918
And I assure you, sir, it is real.

51:38.760 --> 51:41.513
Perhaps it is too difficult
for some of you to admit.

51:43.560 --> 51:48.509
We, who have been steeped
in the bigotry of the church for so long,

51:48.600 --> 51:52.115
cannot give much credence
to an older civilization.

51:53.040 --> 51:56.999
Particularly one created
by a race the white man

51:57.080 --> 51:59.640
has so brutally condemned
to slavery and death.

52:00.640 --> 52:05.760
Are you insisting that these savages,
they're our equals?

52:06.280 --> 52:10.034
I do not know, Mr. Barkley,
but I intend to find out.

52:10.120 --> 52:12.873
What?! Savages
in Westminster Abbey?

52:15.360 --> 52:17.316
Hence, your disrespect, sir!

52:19.240 --> 52:20.753
But what is at stake?

52:23.080 --> 52:25.355
If we may find a city...

52:26.280 --> 52:29.238
where one was considered
impossible to exist...

52:29.800 --> 52:34.351
It may well write a whole
new chapter in human history.

52:35.200 --> 52:37.156
Yes! Yes!

52:37.240 --> 52:39.071
Consider my evidence.

52:40.240 --> 52:42.390
I have archaeological finds.

52:44.000 --> 52:48.835
Antiquities as sophisticated as
any in Asia or Europe...

52:50.200 --> 52:52.270
in the middle of the jungle!

52:52.360 --> 52:54.157
Pots and pans!

52:54.640 --> 52:56.073
Pots and pans!

52:56.600 --> 52:57.669
Pots and pans!

52:58.520 --> 53:00.272
Pans! Pots and pans!

53:00.760 --> 53:02.955
Pots and pans!

53:11.800 --> 53:15.713
- Settle down, children! Settle down!
- Ooh...

53:17.600 --> 53:22.276
After my return from the jungle,
I have examined a single document;

53:22.720 --> 53:25.393
dating from the conquistadors, Mr Barkley!

53:27.440 --> 53:29.476
It states explicitly

53:29.600 --> 53:31.795
the discovery of a lost city.

53:34.160 --> 53:39.154
Uncovered in Trinity College, Dublin,
this week by my lovely wife.

53:41.320 --> 53:46.394
W ritten by a Portuguese soldier
in 1753, and I quote,

53:47.840 --> 53:52.470
"We came upon the ruins of
an ancient city bedecked with gold.

53:53.560 --> 53:54.595
Roads...

53:55.200 --> 53:56.200
Temples...

53:56.680 --> 53:57.908
Ancient symbols...

53:58.000 --> 54:00.230
What? El Dorado?

54:00.320 --> 54:01.673
No, gentlemen!

54:02.080 --> 54:05.356
- I call it "Zed."
- Zed?

54:05.440 --> 54:08.477
The ultimate piece of the human puzzle!

54:09.240 --> 54:12.835
It is there and we must find it!

54:13.200 --> 54:14.633
Mr. Fawcett!

54:16.320 --> 54:19.869
Mr. Fawcett, I say we return!

54:20.800 --> 54:24.793
I say we go and find the glory!

54:25.360 --> 54:26.509
What say you?

54:26.960 --> 54:28.632
What I say, Mr. Murray...

54:29.960 --> 54:31.837
is I accept that challenge!

54:35.040 --> 54:36.268
Mr. Costin!

54:37.000 --> 54:38.353
I see you seated there.

54:39.240 --> 54:40.878
Will you return with us?

54:42.080 --> 54:43.080
Mr. Fawcett.

54:43.800 --> 54:45.074
That jungle is hell, but...

54:45.600 --> 54:46.794
one kind of likes it.

54:49.160 --> 54:50.718
We shall return!

54:51.720 --> 54:53.711
And we shall find the glory!

55:03.640 --> 55:06.598
I have such high hopes, Cheeky.

55:08.760 --> 55:11.320
With this journey, we may be able

55:11.400 --> 55:15.188
to tear down their
narrowminded convictions.

55:19.760 --> 55:23.753
I do believe I am quite ready
to accompany on your next journey.

55:30.880 --> 55:31.880
What do you mean?

55:35.720 --> 55:37.870
The children will be
back in school by then.

55:40.120 --> 55:41.792
And I have learned to read the stars...

55:43.480 --> 55:44.515
and navigate.

55:46.800 --> 55:49.473
I've become very well versed
in the history of the region.

55:52.160 --> 55:53.991
After all, it is I who found the document.

55:54.480 --> 55:55.629
I know, darling.

55:58.920 --> 56:00.558
But that would be impossible.

56:02.960 --> 56:05.076
It's not a place at all for a woman.

56:08.280 --> 56:09.599
"Not a place for a woman"?

56:10.400 --> 56:11.400
Yes.

56:12.160 --> 56:14.879
We believe firmly
in the equality between us.

56:14.960 --> 56:17.952
In equality, yes,
but in mind, not in body.

56:18.040 --> 56:19.040
Ah.

56:19.680 --> 56:23.195
The rigor of such a trip would be
beyond your imagination.

56:23.840 --> 56:26.680
I believe it is generally acknowledged
that the pain a woman experiences

56:26.760 --> 56:29.399
during childbirth far exceeds
anything a man must endure.

56:29.800 --> 56:32.960
- This is not about childbirth.
- Oh, what would you know of childbirth?

56:33.800 --> 56:36.519
Have you witnessed two minutes of it,
let alone endured it?

56:40.120 --> 56:41.120
The jungle...

56:42.080 --> 56:44.958
is about years of practice...

56:46.360 --> 56:48.954
training, the art of soldiering.

56:50.480 --> 56:51.480
I have that.

56:52.720 --> 56:56.235
It is about maggots in your skin.
It is about deadly snakes

56:56.320 --> 56:59.073
and disease that make you vomit blood.

57:00.840 --> 57:02.478
You could not bear it.

57:03.360 --> 57:05.476
And I could not bear that either.

57:05.560 --> 57:09.599
Somehow I managed to bear the dangers
you faced the years you were gone.

57:09.920 --> 57:11.990
This way me might be together
for some of our lives!

57:12.080 --> 57:13.195
You are my wife!

57:16.320 --> 57:17.435
I need you here.

57:17.520 --> 57:18.589
Oh, God.

57:18.680 --> 57:21.353
Not as a tentmate
in need of constant care.

57:23.280 --> 57:26.192
And in this fantasy of yours,
what happens to the children?

57:28.760 --> 57:30.955
Please, try to be reasonable.

57:33.600 --> 57:36.114
You will throw reasonable in my face.

57:36.920 --> 57:39.912
Was it reasonable to stay here
and struggle to provide

57:40.000 --> 57:41.840
for the children while you
wandered the jungle?

57:43.080 --> 57:44.308
No. You have given no thought,

57:44.400 --> 57:47.039
not on thought, to my
aspirations as a woman.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.016
Have you thought about that?

57:49.040 --> 57:54.114
Men and women have performed
their roles since the beginning of time!

57:54.680 --> 57:57.672
It is the cornerstone
of our civilization.

57:57.760 --> 58:00.069
I must say, I did expect more
understanding from you,

58:00.160 --> 58:01.309
and I am disgraced

58:01.400 --> 58:02.840
- by your ignorant posture!
- Mother!

58:03.720 --> 58:04.630
It's all right, darling.

58:04.720 --> 58:06.176
I'm sorry we were shouting.

58:06.200 --> 58:08.440
- Run along I'll come in...
- Mother, please don't fight!

58:08.480 --> 58:09.674
It's all right, Jack. Go.

58:39.600 --> 58:43.070
121 miles
to Oviedo's last marking.

58:49.360 --> 58:50.760
You should put some grease on that.

58:52.440 --> 58:53.440
Will do.

58:55.480 --> 58:56.549
Where's Mr. Murray?

58:57.480 --> 58:58.833
He's bringing up the rear, chief.

59:01.160 --> 59:02.160
Mr. Murray!

59:03.400 --> 59:04.958
Yes?

59:05.040 --> 59:06.155
How are you managing?

59:06.800 --> 59:09.155
I am managing well, thank you.

59:10.440 --> 59:13.750
My pack is just a little heavy it seems,

59:14.960 --> 59:16.234
Perhaps I shall...

59:17.240 --> 59:20.755
rid myself of the unnecessary
accoutrements, yes?

59:21.800 --> 59:23.358
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

59:24.240 --> 59:26.708
You don't want to be ill-equipped
for the journey ahead.

59:26.800 --> 59:27.800
Well, yes.

59:28.400 --> 59:29.400
However...

59:30.560 --> 59:31.754
an awful lot of this...

59:32.480 --> 59:36.359
scientific equipment seems
to be slowing us down.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.228
When we reach the river then,

59:40.600 --> 59:42.716
but you must keep one
spare set of clothing.

59:43.480 --> 59:44.754
And, of course, your mattress.

59:45.440 --> 59:47.829
I believe I shall go
naked as Adam in this...

59:48.320 --> 59:49.320
infernal heat.

59:50.880 --> 59:52.029
What a site that would be.

59:53.120 --> 59:54.120
Let's keep going.

59:55.320 --> 59:57.276
That bugger wishes he was
back on the South Pole.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.315
He'll pull his weight soon enough.
Don't worry.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.681
Should we treat ourselves
to the mail, gentlemen?

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.678
We've still got the sack
from San Carlos.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.872
You've got two from
your wife and son, Major.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.112
There's been a major discovery in Peru.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.913
Oh, and an American,

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:32.230
Hiram Bingham, he's found the lost city
in the lndies, Machu Picchu.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.795
He says that Dr. Hamilton Rice
is hot on his trail.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.717
Seems we're in a race
with the Americans now.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.160
They're after a bit of our prestige.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.514
It's too far north.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.600
Mm.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.873
Still... Proves there's much to be found.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.908
We've lost the other boat.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.200
Savages!

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.551
- Arm yourselves!
- No! Hold your fire.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.229
Everyone out of the boat.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.675
Take cover!

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920
Mr. Manley!

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.879
Get your concertina.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.960
My concertina, sir?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:29.876
Yes, do it now!

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.598
Play "Soldiers of the Queen"!

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.360
Come on!

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.272
Mr. Costin, come and sing with me.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.080
Come!

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.960
Are you ready?

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920
And!

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:53.752
We're soldiers of the Queen, my lads

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.593
Who've been my lads,

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.433
Who've seen my lads

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.275
In the fight for England's glory, lads

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.831
The England's soldiers of the Queen!

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.119
- Amigos.
- Hola.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.553
Mano, mano, mano.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.470
Amigos!

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.348
Mano, mano, mano!

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.600
Amigo!

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.360
Amigo!

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Amigo!

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.552
Boys! Point!

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.148
If the red man attacks.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.679
You rally to me at all costs.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.109
Rally to me at all costs.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.911
Oh, good God.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.280
We are safe.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.595
The chief has invited us to be his guests.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.200
You all right?

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.280
This is a tribe of cannibals.

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.314
I know. I know.

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:44.390
The chief explained it's
a dead member of their tribe.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.238
His spirit will enter them if they eat it.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.636
We must attempt to engage.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:58.518
They may have critical information
about our destination.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.108
I... I refuse this madness.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:02.920
I refuse it.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.393
Men, come with me... Come.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.397
Boys, we have to get back to that boat.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.280
Costin.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.360
Sí.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.960
Gracias.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.474
He's heard rumors of a city,
but he's not sure.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:19.636
He said further up the river he thinks
there will be people who can help us.

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:23.760
All right, then.

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.960
Gracias, amigo.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.631
- Comida?
- Food?

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:31.279
Comida?

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.151
- Uh...
- Comida. Sí, gracias.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.600
To you.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.113
That is remarkable.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.348
That substance
only stuns the fish.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.640
They don't kill more than
what they have to.

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.749
Remarkable.

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.471
These so-called savages
have cultivated the jungle.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.037
Where no one thought it could be done.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.069
We've been so...
arrogant and contemptuous.

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.473
I no less than others.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.558
Look how it's all laid out.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.871
It's mathematical in its precision.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.800
Well, it's what you've been saying.

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.392
Imagine what Z must be like.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.638
Well, the canoe's useless now.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.514
We'll have to use the raft.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.189
We leave at sunrise.

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:20.160
Chief.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.240
Chief!

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.240
Think I found him.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:39.840
Hello, old sport.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.790
I appear to have gotten myself lost.

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.799
Thank God you're all alive.
I had assumed that you'd been

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.633
cannibalized by those savages.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:02.268
Look at my leg. I have a nasty wound.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.351
You'll be looked after. Come.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.910
- No.
- We must keep moving.

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.588
I think I have a bit of a fever coming on.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:12.870
Manley, help me clean all of this up.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.034
This was in my bag.

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:37.832
It was a gift from my wife and children
for all of us to share.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.073
I know. I was just very...

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:43.800
hungry.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:50.437
I'm a little bit dead. If you don't mind
I'm going to rest for a little...

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.440
while longer.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.196
You have no right to be tired.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:01.550
My own children, at their tender ages,
could be counted on more than you.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.428
And I could be home... with them.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.351
And yet, I am here with you

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.951
to attempt great things.

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.548
Have you water please?

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.517
You'll get water when we get to the raft.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:23.353
Mr. Manley, help me get him on his feet.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.633
Stay where you are, Mr. Murray.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.232
It's essential we keep the balance.

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.229
Murray!

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:38.955
Stay down!

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:43.151
Stay down, God damn you!

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.913
Murray, stay low to the ground!

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.560
Swim to shore!

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.393
We'll bank further down!

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.475
Swim to shore!

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.708
Let go! Swim to shore!

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.319
- Let go!
- No!

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.234
You're tipping the raft!
We're losing supplies! God damn you!

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:11.478
I said let go, you pigheaded weakling!

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.560
Let go!

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.559
Mr. Manley, help me!

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.232
Help me get to shore!

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.235
- Shut up.
- Chief!

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.635
We've lost a third of our rations.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.553
- I was drowning!
- There was no chance of that!

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.350
And this after you stole our food!

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.555
I suppose I should have starved myself.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.480
That would have been the honorable
course of action, wouldn't it?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.036
Isn't that what you want?
You want me to die.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:59.394
I... Please slow down.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.870
Give a dying man a chance.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.639
I just want to be dead.

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:18.557
...young upstart and his
vulgar quest for glory.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.311
Like a Judas...

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.278
he has delivered me...

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.280
into this...

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.360
jungle.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.353
Well, we're two weeks behind...

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.231
according to the sextant and the charts.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:42.440
Chief.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.870
This leg wound of his
is becoming more infected.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.158
Mr. Murray's got blood poisoning now.

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:54.989
I noticed.

01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.560
You think he'll make it?

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.880
Slim chance.

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:12.397
He is not worth kissing...

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.998
the hem of your garment.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.200
As I...

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.718
am not worthy of yours.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.356
Give me strength to survive.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.593
He is not worthy.

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.192
No. No.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.789
Yes? What is it?

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.319
There are mining encampments
south of us on the river.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.871
In the morning, you'll be
on your way to them.

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.918
I'm going to give you our last horse

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:07.718
with what supplies I can spare
and an lndian to guide you.

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:11.359
I have a family at home.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:17.197
I cannot allow you to jeopardize
the welfare of the entire crew.

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.870
You don't give a wit about me.

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.311
Or about any of the party.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.475
You don't even care about going home.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.429
You only care...

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.068
about your lost...

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.560
city.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.471
I'm going to see
if there's a path through!

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.520
Chief!

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:42.960
Chief!

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.080
Chief!

01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:58.960
I saw it!

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.193
We're getting close!

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:03.709
Keep going!

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.994
We need to go back.

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:19.320
Guy's a bloody bastard!
Cost us our last horse!

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.393
And this is how he repays us.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:27.237
Rations ruined!
Murray's covered them in oil!

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.320
Look at it!

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.154
We must turn back.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.517
There is no turning back.

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.239
We are right here!

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.435
We've nothing to show for our efforts.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:57.120
- No evidence...
- What do we go on with?

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.112
With what we have on our backs,
we'll last a week at most!

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.075
It's over, Percy!

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.751
To be sent to the RGS:

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:38.079
Mr. James Murray was forced
to separate from our expedition

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.118
to seek medical attention.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.158
His location is currently unknown,

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.677
and he has most likely perished.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:55.113
The rest of the group
shall arrive back in England

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.433
as soon as is possible.

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.559
It looks like a war with France.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.400
Better all get home or
we'll miss our chance to fight.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.713
Please send that immediately.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.800
Yes, sir.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.993
Chase it. Go on! Go on, Bri.

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.276
That is Joan,
as you might have guessed.

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.475
Oh, Jack!

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:31.830
Your daughter.

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.480
Sorry! I didn't mean to do that.

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:35.148
Beautiful child.

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:37.749
Hello, Joan.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.072
- I'll fetch the boys.
- No.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:03.909
Let them finish.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.792
When they're done, send them in.

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.791
It should be I who tells them
what has happened.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.280
You're real.

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:35.590
Three, two, one... Go!

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:37.999
How much they've grown.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.717
You've done beautifully with them.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.680
My ball!

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.880
Hey, come on!

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.994
Gentlemen, welcome to our new home.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.351
Thank you for coming
at such short notice.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.352
Mr. John. Gentlemen.

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.433
Please, will you step this way?

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.120
- Congratulations on your knighthood.
- Ah, thank you.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.991
I think that you know everybody here.

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:26.272
Mr. James Murray arrived
in London just this morning.

01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:30.996
We felt it critical to assemble
as soon as possible.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.751
Congratulations on your safe return.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.959
It's a remarkable effort.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.679
Mr. Murray contends
that you abandoned him.

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:51.429
Is this correct?

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.159
No. It is not.

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.830
He was given money and food.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.834
It was an unfortunate but necessary
maneuver in order to save lives.

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:02.069
Sir George.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.275
We spent all our time.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.312
Playing around in the mud
with the savages.

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.713
I never saw any evidence of a lost city.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:19.791
You were the reason we did not reach
our destination, Mr. Murray.

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:22.636
You poured paraffin on all our supplies.

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.996
I reject that accusation, Sir John.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:29.158
I cannot tolerate any further insult
from this young man.

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:33.279
I... have retained counsel
and I will proceed accordingly.

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:35.919
And as for his lackeys,

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.152
they are swine and not to be trusted.

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.358
You should've been beaten in the jungle
like the dog that you are.

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:44.640
Please gentlemen.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.712
Our nation is now at war.

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:51.518
It ill becomes us to indulge
personal conflicts.

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.672
I earnestly beseech you
to come to an understanding.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:24:59.800
Very well.

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.711
I most generously offer that...

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:08.315
If you are willing
to apologize to me here

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:10.915
in front of this entire society,

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:17.188
I will consider withdrawing my claims
against the RGS and yourself,

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.916
with certain conditions, of course.

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:22.440
Well, Major.

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:24.748
Will you apologize?

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.878
For the general good...

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.271
I am prepared to reconcile.

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:34.800
Thank you.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:39.308
I will, of course, need to hear
Mr. Murray's conditions.

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:44.359
On the day that I agreed
to join you on your mission

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:47.640
and allowed your star to enter my sphere,

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.758
your wife was present
to witness your ascent.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.189
My only condition is that
she again be present

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.631
to witness your acknowledgement

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.440
of the wrongs...

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.074
that you have done to me.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.400
Sir.

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:09.715
Mr. Murray.

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:15.754
The last time I saw you, I was putting you
on the only remaining horse,

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.792
giving you far more
than your share of our food.

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:25.758
The men begged me
to leave you where you lay,

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.192
but I could not do that.

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:33.596
And as a consequence, I saved your life.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.238
You saved my life?

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.312
You saved my...

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.832
I demand an apology right now.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.918
You will apologize to me.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:46.998
I will apologize...

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Thank you.

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:53.989
...to my men.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:01.875
I'm sorry I ever considered Mr. Murray
worthy of your company.

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:07.709
And as I ever mistook
a man's rank for his medal,

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:11.313
but I shall not make that mistake again.

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.838
What your purpose is
in this ambush, I cannot say.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:23.349
But you need fear
no more embarrassment from me.

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.828
I hereby resign from this institution,

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.271
and I shall proceed on my own.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.793
No, p-please, Major! Please!

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:34.073
This is outrageous!
Please, you must reconsider!

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:36.640
Magnus!

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.554
I shall teach him.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
What's wrong?

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.994
You've received a letter.

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:16.792
All former officers not currently posted,
must send their names to the war office.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.672
Let us hope it is a brief conflict.

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:29.080
Talk to the boys.

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.198
Don't be concerned, my love.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.870
I've spent a whole life training for this.

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:41.794
Hello, boy.

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.200
Father.

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:53.880
Jack.

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:55.280
Brian.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.309
Has Harvey been walked?

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.234
- Um, no, not yet.
- All right.

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.235
I'll do it.

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.760
Father, you will not have
to leave again, will you?

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:07.720
To fight?

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:12.633
If the reports are true,
I'm afraid I must.

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.433
Father, you've only just returned.

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.679
It's... it's hardly fair.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.439
I'm obligated to serve.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.080
Obligated.

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.192
What of your obligation to mother?

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.589
And to us?

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.400
Your family.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.998
The... the family that you've chosen
to abandon for so many years.

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.080
Jack.

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:40.191
How dare you talk to me like that.

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.756
How dare... How dare you, father...

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:47.869
You do not think of us.

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:50.919
You think of lndians,

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.753
or Germans, or any other path
to glory that you can find.

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.000
Jack, stop it! That's enough!

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:58.112
Mother, I will not stop.
You have returned a failure.

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.478
The papers are full of it.
And you want to abandon us again?

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:02.800
- It's contemptuous...
- Enough!

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:05.760
Percy...

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:17.640
I hate him.

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:19.720
Oh, Jack.

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:23.874
Everything your father has done,
since the day you came into this world,

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:25.120
has been to better your life.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.558
And for your sake, I hope, one day,

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:29.756
you will come regret
the things you just said to him.

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.600
Please, just go.

01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:37.916
Please. Please, just go.

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:12.999
Well, what do you know, chief?

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.031
It appears our old friend,
Mr. James Murray,

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.314
is not so powerful after all.

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:20.560
Why do you say that?

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:24.276
The bastard's gone off on an
Artic expedition with Canadians and...

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.240
mutinied.

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:28.320
He's not been heard from since.

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:31.520
Take a look.

01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:39.111
I'm sure his magnificent skills
will bring him back safely.

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.350
Someone should warn the Eskimos

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:48.750
that Mr. Murray is on the prowl.

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:00.880
All right, Major.

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.389
Mr. Costin!

01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:06.393
Despite the medium of fine
spiritualistic skills of the Russians.

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:10.079
Come! She'll read your fortune.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.157
I can't believe he smuggled her in here.

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:15.633
Welcome to the world beyond.

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.520
- Sorry, chap. Come on.
- That's enough. It's the Major's turn.

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.879
Move on. I'm with him.

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.000
Let's see the Major's fortune.

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:32.398
We will be in battle soon, madam.

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:36.432
Any spiritual aid would be
greatly appreciated.

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:40.113
You are the explorer?

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:44.320
I was.

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:48.438
As were these fine men,

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.352
who have transferred here
so we could all be together.

01:32:58.440 --> 01:32:59.589
Give me your hand.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.309
Feel my hand.

01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:12.674
Listen to my voice.

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:20.958
Is it... a forest?

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:24.632
You dream to be in a forest.

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:31.075
I wish to find a lost city.

01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:33.120
Can you...

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.390
see yourself there now?

01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.949
Try to picture it in your mind.

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:49.280
Yes.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.475
I can see it.

01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:00.110
You cannot blind yourself to this vision.

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:02.875
What you seek...

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.029
is far greater...

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.434
than you ever imagined.

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:15.356
A vast land bejeweled with peoples.

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:24.872
Your soul will never be quiet
until you find this new place.

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.632
It is your destiny.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.232
With it, you will illuminate the world.

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:46.113
The whole world has set itself afire.

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:52.950
I must look elsewhere to quench the blaze.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:22.954
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:25.680
- Sir.
- Good morning, sir.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.274
When I was younger,

01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:36.231
I ventured all for king and country,

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:39.439
for place and rank.

01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:44.669
I believed that to be
the makings of a man.

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:50.111
But my travels have taught me,

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.237
such ambitions

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:56.393
are mere phantoms.

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:01.478
I know in our hearts,

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.750
we fight for our loves ones, as we should.

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:10.869
But they are not here.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.468
So instead let us fight for each other.

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:22.760
Good luck.

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.909
And may God be with all of you.

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.479
And fuck the bloody bush!

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.432
Well said, Mr. Costin!

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:35.670
Right men! Into positions!

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.237
Take down the gunner!
Take down the gunner up ahead!

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.509
Come on!

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.833
Come on! Keep going!

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.830
Come on! Push forward!

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.595
Gas!

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:09.720
Gas!

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.560
Gas!

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:21.795
Manley! Gas!

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.479
Darling, it is I.

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.919
We are here.

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.028
The children are here.

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.030
- Nina.
- Yes, my darling.

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:07.280
Come.

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.509
That is Joan.

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:19.034
Let him feel your face. Come along.

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.160
See?

01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.315
Brian.

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:25.674
Where's Jack?

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:31.080
Father, I'm here.

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:37.357
I thought I had died.

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:39.789
Oh, no.

01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:44.235
You were exposed to chlorine gas.

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.679
Your eyes were affected,

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:49.479
but they are very confident
that your sight shall return.

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:53.919
The rest of the men?

01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:58.269
- Costin?
- Mr. Costin was unharmed.

01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.077
You'll brigade suffered many losses,

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:05.311
but it was the only one
that did not retreat.

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:09.917
Thanks to you bravery, they are raising
your rank to Lieutenant Colonel.

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.675
Lieutenant Colonel?

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.794
After all that he has done?

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:16.600
Jack.

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:23.474
I think I was dreaming...

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:26.837
about Amazonia.

01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:28.480
I...

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:32.350
I'm afraid you may never be able
to return to your jungle.

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:35.670
I am sorry.

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:37.360
Shh, my darling.

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:38.948
Shh. Rest.

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:44.233
All will be well.

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:47.753
I must go back.

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.909
But love...

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:52.190
You cannot think
of these things right now.

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:55.400
I'm going to take
the children for some air.

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.080
Come along.

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.480
Father.

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:24.960
Jack.

01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:04.350
America has quite
a fascination with you.

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:07.428
Our readers have been asking
where you've been since the war.

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:09.760
I'm grateful for their interest.

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:14.833
You may tell your readers
I've recovered from my wounds

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:16.751
and have been adapting to home life.

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.596
Your pursuits in South America
have led to a tremendous interest

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:25.398
in exploration in the Unites States.

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:27.471
There have been many new voyages planned.

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:29.880
Have there?

01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:35.035
Yes, Dr. Hamilton Rice leaves for Brazil
soon with radio and airplanes.

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.634
He's taking a large
and very well-armed party.

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.908
Well, let us hope that Dr. Rice,
with all his arms,

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.719
does not destroy what he
wishes to discover.

01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:50.395
- Allow me to ask you a question.
- Yes, sir.

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:54.113
How did you find us here?

01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:55.909
Well, your son, Colonel.

01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:57.829
He wrote us a letter.

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:00.715
Didn't he tell you?

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.189
Good shot, Jack.

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.200
Thank you, father.

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.476
Getting quite expert with that rifle.

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:33.879
Practice makes perfect, you know?

01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:08.473
I have something for you.

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:13.393
This was given to me

01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:16.110
by a Guaraní lndian chief.

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:18.560
Great man.

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:21.520
It's yours now.

01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.080
Thank you.

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:35.033
It must've been a glorious day.

01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:45.113
You still believe in Z, do you not?

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:49.672
That we underestimated the lndian.

01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.439
That is why we should go back.

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:00.069
You and I, together.

01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.832
We could find the city once and for all.

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:11.360
Jack.

01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:15.952
I'm an old bastard now.

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:24.037
Father, you and I, we both know it.
You easily outmatch my strengths.

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.631
And now you can see as clear as day again.

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:29.959
There is nothing stopping us.

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:36.040
Father.

01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:39.596
The Americans will
venture there with their guns.

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:43.754
And then we must pray that they
do not destroy the lndian.

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.638
We must find it before they do.

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.591
I want nothing more than
to go with you, Father.

01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:58.560
It's everything you've always wanted.

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:11.435
You would have to consult
a higher authority.

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:16.392
I understand that it's dangerous,

01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:19.336
But you've said so yourself
with everything that's happened in Europe,

01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:21.920
it's not possible to choose
a safe passage through life.

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:25.433
So many men near my own age
did not return from the war.

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:28.589
And who is to say
it will not happen again?

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:30.759
It could, mother.

01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:32.880
It could happen again.

01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:37.155
By all accounts, I should be furious
because you've just...

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:41.035
You've just used my very own
words against me.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.831
And how can I refute them?
They are my own.

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:46.638
Joan's been so annoying!
Bloody slapped me!

01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.551
All right, Joan, don't slap him.

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:50.631
Thank you. Off! Go on!

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.149
She hit me around the face.

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:54.151
Brian, I'm in the middle
of a conversation!

01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:56.960
Go and help you sister get some wood,
please, from the log pile now.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Now!

01:47:58.440 --> 01:47:59.634
Fight your own battles!

01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:08.560
Momma, please.

01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:25.360
There is little doubt
that I would worry night and day

01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:28.678
about my boys in the jungle.

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:38.235
But we have never let fear
determine our future.

01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:42.280
That's all.

01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:48.029
Mother, thank you.

01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:50.599
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:56.831
- Father, this...
- Jack, Jack, Jack.

01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:59.357
- We are not there yet.
- I know.

01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:01.080
We'll have to raise
a great deal of money.

01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:02.673
Of course, I understand. Yes.

01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:06.718
Go on. Let me talk to your mother.

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:08.389
And training?

01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:10.671
Well, of course,
I shall begin right away.

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:13.988
You and I, and Mr. Costin
I'm sure would love to join us.

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:16.959
Thank you, mother. Thank you.

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.240
What?

01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:30.235
I'm just surprised you agreed so quickly.

01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:33.829
What choice did I have?

01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:38.873
It's his essential nature;
would be wrong to betray that.

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:42.836
Besides, you will be there to guide him.

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:47.794
Here they are, Chief.

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:51.519
Here's the last of my notebooks.

01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:53.789
A map would be helpful.

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:03.557
Can I truly not persuade you to come?

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:10.596
We came so close, Henry.

01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:13.758
Think of what it would mean...

01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:17.197
To finally find it together.

01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:22.632
Chief, I have a wife and child now.

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:31.915
My own children were
younger than yours is now

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.513
when we went on our first trip.

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:37.636
Can't say it was not a sacrifice.

01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:42.757
But if you could see my boy now,

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:45.392
his vim and vigor,

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:51.075
I guarantee it would tear down
your resistance in an instant.

01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:53.880
Would you like
some more brandy, sir?

01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:56.638
Nope. Thank you, Nigel.

01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:58.800
- For yourself, sir?
- No, thank you.

01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:01.232
Chief, please don't
misunderstand me. I'm...

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:05.949
But it's something...

01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:09.911
This search for Z...

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.752
I can no longer bear the cost.

01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:26.196
You've come to doubt its existence?

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:28.120
No.

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.998
I only doubt Z could provide
all the answers you seek from it.

01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:36.631
I wish you success, my dear friend.

01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:41.748
This will be
no pampered expedition.

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:44.311
Top heavy missions get nowhere.

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:49.033
They linger on the fringe of civilization
and bask in publicity.

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:50.120
We will not.

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:52.471
We will be in the field for three years,

01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:55.509
standing on our own two feet,

01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:57.952
surviving by our wits.

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:01.553
Tribesmen shall take our dispatchers

01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:04.473
to be delivered for publication
as often as possible.

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:07.438
But who's going to finance
this latest journey of yours?

01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:12.755
The money is generously being supplied
by a consortium of American newspapers

01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:15.593
and Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr.

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:18.995
Are you aware The Royal
Geographical Society

01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.389
has just offered to help
with the financing?

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:24.153
I'm glad to see our nation
is not to be left behind.

01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:29.474
I would like now to introduce
my companion for this historic expedition,

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.753
my own son, Mr. Jack Fawcett.

01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:37.631
He is a man of great discipline
and keenest muscle.

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.952
Well, we couldn't very well be shamed
by the Americans now could we?

01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:45.515
No, but I am proud to say
that we did finally

01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:47.352
manage to meet them halfway.

01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:52.833
Sir George, God rest his soul,
always bore you great affection.

01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:58.510
But I admit my error in not accepting
your beliefs long ago.

01:52:58.600 --> 01:52:59.600
Oh.

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:02.631
All that matters now is the future.

01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:03.720
Yes.

01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:07.839
I have carried this

01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:10.912
for the last twenty years.

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:13.835
When we reach Z,

01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.597
I shall send it to you as a sign.

01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:20.796
Just in case I decide not to come back.

01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:22.472
Oh, nonsense, nonsense.

01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:26.996
Oh, now we have something for you.

01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:29.357
Mr. Barkley, please.

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:33.314
The society's highest honor,

01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:36.193
the Founder's Gold Medal.

01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:41.433
You are
truly deserving, Colonel.

01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:44.990
- Truly.
- Indeed.

01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:55.200
All the arrangements are made.
We leave for Portugal on the seventh,

01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:57.280
and then we meet again in Brazil.

01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:01.753
No one can best us now.

01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:07.116
Remember, the code with the coordinates
is in my desk, and Mr. Costin

01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:09.919
- has a copy in safekeeping.
- Yes, you've told me a thousand times.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.560
Now run along or you'll miss your boat.

01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:23.553
You're a man now; responsible
for you mother and sister's care.

01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:25.829
It's a fine calling.

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:29.553
No less, perhaps even
more virtuous than ours.

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:32.320
All right?

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:35.480
Goodbye, father.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.798
I shall indeed miss you as I always have.

01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:43.000
- Look after your father for me.
- Of course, I will, of course.

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:44.314
- And have fun.
- Yes.

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:45.400
And be bold.

01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:48.160
Goodbye, Joan.

01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:51.109
Goodbye, father.

01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:52.880
I love you.

01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:56.480
On to Z then,

01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:58.549
and to new history!

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:07.715
Goodbye, the boys!

01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:09.600
Woo!

01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:33.113
Forty million, father!

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:35.954
Paper says forty million people
are following our journey!

01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:37.920
It's incredible!

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:43.440
It's wonderful.

01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:27.680
How are you faring?

01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:29.709
Never felt better.

01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:31.555
Neither have I.

01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:34.229
We'll be on the river soon,

01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:37.432
and if we're lucky to see an opera.

01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:12.154
This is where they sang?

01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:14.160
It's astonishing.

01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:18.430
It's just a pity you
couldn't see it intact.

01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:21.160
Yes.

01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:25.477
The jungle is
restoring the balance.

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:32.708
Dearest Cheeky,

01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:36.949
This is the last letter
you shall receive until we reach Z.

01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:40.229
The rest of our party is returning home.

01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:45.274
Jack is acquitting himself marvelously.

01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:48.949
Today we reached a tribe of Indians

01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:55.155
who told us of a cave entirely unknown
to anyone outside of their clan...

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.070
They tell of an enormous rock there,

01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:07.232
covered with painted pictures
of men and horses.

01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:12.229
It's location is, perhaps,
the gateway to Z...

01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:17.040
The chief has been
very generous to us here,

01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:22.270
and he reminds me, yet again,
that we are all made of the same clay...

01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:48.519
I expect we will be in touch
with the old civilization within months.

01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:53.272
Thereafter, our fate is
in the lap of the gods.

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:56.554
You need have no fear of any failure.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.149
Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:25.880
Stay calm.

01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:29.675
I know the approach just keep going.

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:41.600
Amigos.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Amigos.

01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:47.240
Amigos.

01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:49.200
Amigos.

01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:01.552
All right, come on back the way we came.

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:06.630
Slowly, slowly, don't rush.

02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:20.393
Into the brush! Go!

02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:30.496
Jack!

02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:31.680
I'm all right. I'm all right.

02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:56.192
No, Jack! Keep going! Keep going!

02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:00.399
Be brave.

02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:06.950
Nothing will happen to us
that is not our destiny.

02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:47.440
We're going to die.

02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:54.151
We're going
to die here today.

02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:03.398
So much of life is a mystery, my boy.

02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:11.068
We know so little of this world.

02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:21.997
But you and I have made a journey that
other men cannot even imagine.

02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:29.997
And this has given
understanding to our hearts.

02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:36.635
I love you, father.

02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:42.513
I love you, son.

02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:32.196
A toast, shall we?

02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:35.113
Actually, Lord Bernard, I wanted...

02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:37.478
I wanted to read something if I could.

02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:40.509
Now I'm in for it.

02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:45.513
It's something I wrote in the event
that I did not survive the birth.

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:54.957
"My Percy, I know your first
instinct will be to grieve,

02:06:56.280 --> 02:07:00.193
but I adjure you rather
to consider our son

02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:03.278
and the love you must show him.

02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:07.639
I knew it would be a boy.

02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:13.594
Always teach him to dream,
to seek the unknown,

02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:19.276
to look for what is beautiful
is its own reward.

02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:25.276
And I beg you to remember
those words so easy to forget:

02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:27.909
A man's reach...

02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:30.998
should exceed his grasp,

02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:35.158
or what's a Heaven for?

02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:38.751
My dearest love, forever."

02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:32.269
A man came to see me yesterday.

02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:37.714
He was from Brazil.

02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:41.554
He has seen...

02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:44.473
Jack and Percy...

02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:47.792
living with the lndians.

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:51.999
He says they claim...

02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:54.552
to have reached Z.

02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:02.072
My dear, it's... it's...

02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:04.428
It's been years.

02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:11.073
We've sent almost 100 men to look
for your husband and your son, and...

02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:15.873
I fear we have to accept the inevitable.

02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:26.674
Sir John, I confess that the brutal
wear and tear is great,

02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:32.389
and I suffer with heart and soul.

02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:37.754
It has taken...

02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:41.436
all my strength of will

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.629
to push horrors from my mind,
but I beg you...

02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:50.152
not to lose confidence.

02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:56.240
I cannot...

02:09:57.080 --> 02:09:58.080
doubt...

02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:02.590
after so many years of sacrifice.

02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:06.709
It has become...

02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:09.798
my own life's work.

02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:24.960
The Brazilian gave me this to give to you.

02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:28.349
He said Percy told him
you would understand.

02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:36.150
I have trained myself
to be impartial to evidence, but surely...

02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:39.352
Surely, this is a sign.

02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:44.560
Yes.

02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:46.879
I will have it examined.

02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:50.960
Thank you.

02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.354
That is all I can ask.
