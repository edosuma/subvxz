01:14.725 --> 01:17.560
If I get the maple bacon,
that's kinda Paleo, right?

01:17.561 --> 01:19.854
Only if you killed it
yourself with a crossbow.

01:19.855 --> 01:22.106
You should try the red velvet. It's new.

01:22.107 --> 01:23.190
Oh, jeez.

01:23.191 --> 01:24.609
Do I look like an idiot to you?

01:24.610 --> 01:26.110
No.

01:26.111 --> 01:28.112
You think you can squeeze
an extra dollar out of me

01:28.113 --> 01:30.782
because it's, like, "Ooh, trendy,
it looks like its bleeding"?

01:30.783 --> 01:32.825
No, in your heart of hearts,
you know as well as I do,

01:32.826 --> 01:34.952
red velvet is bullshit.

01:34.953 --> 01:37.539
It tastes like Play-Doh.
It is not velvety.

01:37.540 --> 01:40.292
And the only thing that's good about
it is the cream cheese frosting

01:40.293 --> 01:42.960
which is meant to live on top of
carrot cake, like God intended.

01:42.961 --> 01:45.963
Okay, panda. We hear you.

01:45.964 --> 01:48.800
Red velvet isn't a thing.

01:48.801 --> 01:50.978
Red velvet can go to hell.

01:53.096 --> 01:56.775
You give me two Long Johns and a jelly.

02:03.941 --> 02:06.859
[sighs] Well, I'll be fucked.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.026
What happened?

02:08.027 --> 02:09.788
Mind your own beeswax, Donuts.

02:13.158 --> 02:14.877
Oh, you kidding me?

02:15.411 --> 02:19.590
If I was a lesser person,
I would say, "I told you so."

02:21.083 --> 02:23.426
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

02:29.800 --> 02:31.926
All right, here we are.

02:31.927 --> 02:34.971
Welcome to Litchfield, two-point-nothing.

02:34.972 --> 02:37.890
So recently, we did go from,
uh, public to private,

02:37.891 --> 02:39.892
which is quite a relief.

02:39.893 --> 02:44.564
God bless free market America
of the United States.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.690
[inmate] "Free market"?

02:45.691 --> 02:48.693
Yeah, I worked the night shift
at Sam's Club a while back

02:48.694 --> 02:49.986
and they used to lock us in.

02:49.987 --> 02:52.364
Well, it was probably for
your own protection. [scoffs]

02:52.365 --> 02:53.823
Yeah, it didn't feel like that.

02:53.824 --> 02:56.242
Well, look... [scoffs] you kidding me?

02:56.243 --> 03:01.623
The government socialists are clearly so
far up your butt crack about equality,

03:01.624 --> 03:06.469
when, in code, it's all about just
giving the darker people free shit.

03:07.212 --> 03:11.298
It's all about private corporation
because they really look after us.

03:11.299 --> 03:13.050
And you get religious freedom.

03:13.051 --> 03:16.804
- Yeah, I'm not that religious.
- No? Well, that's too bad.

03:16.805 --> 03:19.932
'Cause if you were a Christian, you
could tell everybody what to do,

03:19.933 --> 03:22.059
and then they do it so they
don't hurt your feelings,

03:22.060 --> 03:23.770
because that's against the law.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.104
[snaps fingers] Come on.

03:25.105 --> 03:28.149
Okay, so this right here
is Mr. Healy's office.

03:28.150 --> 03:29.567
He's one of the counselors.

03:29.568 --> 03:32.069
Now, some of the girls, they
like the black one better, okay?

03:32.070 --> 03:33.237
But, listen...

03:33.238 --> 03:36.491
He brings snacks sometimes and
he's kind of a silver fox.

03:36.492 --> 03:39.411
Down here, we've got visitation.
Down here, okay?

03:39.412 --> 03:41.287
Your family is allowed
to come and see you,

03:41.288 --> 03:44.049
but if they never do...

03:44.750 --> 03:48.085
that's probably just
'cause they're too busy.

03:48.086 --> 03:51.297
But they still care about you. For sure.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.924
For sure.

03:52.925 --> 03:55.468
This place is amazing.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.637
All right, this is still
prison and all, right?

03:57.638 --> 03:59.514
There's no need to jump off the deep end.

03:59.515 --> 04:02.642
We got off the van,
like, five minutes ago,

04:02.643 --> 04:04.226
and I haven't heard anybody screaming.

04:04.227 --> 04:05.770
And the walls are so clean.

04:05.771 --> 04:08.398
[Pennsatucky] Yeah, and we
just got new mattresses, too.

04:08.399 --> 04:10.983
Yes. This here is Chang.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.193
Chang!

04:12.194 --> 04:15.488
So, she works in the commissary.
She don't talk much.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.113
Ching Chong Chang!

04:17.115 --> 04:19.366
Fuck you, cracker.

04:19.367 --> 04:21.452
[laughs] She loves when I do that.

04:21.454 --> 04:23.213
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

04:26.667 --> 04:28.710
[Alex] How's life in the panty mill?

04:28.711 --> 04:31.838
Uh, yesterday, we learned
everything about sewing,

04:31.839 --> 04:34.549
including how to serge with a rolled hem

04:34.550 --> 04:37.927
and use a zigzag stitch.

04:37.928 --> 04:41.815
I don't really know what any of it
means, so today's gonna be awesome.

04:45.769 --> 04:48.020
What... [laughs]

04:48.021 --> 04:49.522
How's grounds crew treating you?

04:49.523 --> 04:52.066
The instructions are pretty clear.

04:52.067 --> 04:55.319
Dig. Rake. Schlep.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.403
[Piper] Uh-huh.

04:56.404 --> 04:58.573
[Alex scoffs] It's fine.
And it's outside.

04:58.574 --> 05:02.243
Anything is better than being stuck
down in that sweaty basement

05:02.244 --> 05:05.005
with the fucking puppets
from The Dark Crystal.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.165
I'm thirsty just looking at her.

05:08.166 --> 05:10.835
[whispering] Well, you should
see what she does with pepper.

05:10.836 --> 05:12.336
Hey, lesbians.

05:12.337 --> 05:15.140
My eyes squinty, but ears work fine.

05:15.591 --> 05:17.142
Let's go.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.844
I'm sorry.

05:19.845 --> 05:23.774
- I laugh when I see something super weird.
- [hushed] Alex! Alex!

05:24.307 --> 05:27.069
[Alex] How did she get
a whole box of salt?

05:29.522 --> 05:31.438
[woman speaking Mandarin]
He should be here any minute now.

05:31.439 --> 05:32.690
[man] Is he bringing his checkbook?

05:32.691 --> 05:36.736
Between her plane ticket and bus fare
to Beijing, I'm in for almost a grand.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.363
Flight reimbursement
is included in the deal.

05:39.364 --> 05:42.033
What if I don't like him?

05:42.034 --> 05:44.326
Then you can go back to Hebei
Province and grow potatoes.

05:44.327 --> 05:45.963
[knocking on door]

05:48.456 --> 05:50.508
Don't say anything stupid.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.564
Is this a joke?

06:12.565 --> 06:14.941
Welcome to our family, Mr. Sun.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.901
My sister and I are so
pleased to meet you.

06:16.902 --> 06:19.070
You promised me a beautiful girl.

06:19.071 --> 06:21.113
I never actually said "beautiful."

06:21.114 --> 06:23.490
You said she had "pleasing attributes."

06:23.491 --> 06:25.993
And I'm sure she does.

06:25.994 --> 06:28.663
My sister's a good cook.
And very thrifty.

06:28.664 --> 06:30.247
So am I.

06:30.248 --> 06:32.959
And I paid to find a wife,

06:32.960 --> 06:36.003
not a squatty peasant who
still smells like sheep shit.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.806
Call me when you want to get serious.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.060
We had a deal! Son of a bitch.

06:44.179 --> 06:46.013
What do we do now?

06:46.014 --> 06:48.400
I don't want to go back to China.

06:48.934 --> 06:50.685
I can't take care of her.

06:50.686 --> 06:52.519
Do you have any idea how much she eats?

06:52.520 --> 06:55.064
Business has been terrible.

06:55.065 --> 06:58.067
You must know someone
else who needs a wife.

06:58.068 --> 07:02.947
I'm only as good as the product.

07:02.948 --> 07:09.880
If you don't have the looks,
you at least need charm.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.290
How about finding someone less picky?

07:13.291 --> 07:16.669
It's not like this guy
was on the A-list.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.295
[sighs]

07:18.296 --> 07:19.847
What am I going to do?

07:20.883 --> 07:23.685
I could help you in the shop.

07:24.469 --> 07:26.521
You owe me eight hundred dollars.

07:28.056 --> 07:30.767
[indistinct chatter on TV]

07:30.768 --> 07:32.894
[reporter]
That was the scene just a few minutes ago

07:32.895 --> 07:35.396
outside this Lower Manhattan courthouse,

07:35.397 --> 07:37.982
where culinary celebrity Judy King

07:37.983 --> 07:40.567
was arraigned on charges of tax evasion.
According to authorities...

07:40.568 --> 07:43.320
I never liked this woman.

07:43.321 --> 07:47.167
She puts cream in her carbonara.
It's vulgar.

07:49.327 --> 07:50.745
What are you writing?

07:50.746 --> 07:52.789
It's for drama workshop.

07:52.790 --> 07:56.626
It's about my emotionally
manipulative asshat of a mother

07:56.627 --> 07:58.670
and all the times she betrayed me.

07:58.671 --> 08:00.462
I'm thinking at the end,

08:00.463 --> 08:02.757
I could run her over
with a riding lawnmower.

08:02.758 --> 08:04.133
Shred the bitch.

08:04.134 --> 08:05.927
Oh, that's beautiful, honey.

08:05.928 --> 08:10.565
You can watch your cartoons later.
It's the grown-ups' time now, honey.

08:13.101 --> 08:16.103
Hey, Red. I hear you
got family in Queens.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.438
What about them?

08:17.439 --> 08:20.107
I was wondering if your husband could
give my son a ride up here sometime?

08:20.108 --> 08:22.276
I'll trade you whatever.
I've asked everyone, but...

08:22.277 --> 08:24.787
Dmitri won't be visiting anymore.

08:25.488 --> 08:28.416
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.828
He's a worthless mushroom of a man.

08:31.829 --> 08:33.245
I've known a few of those.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.414
Maybe we should give up and be gay.

08:35.414 --> 08:36.498
We got the haircuts.

08:36.499 --> 08:38.301
[laughs]

08:46.551 --> 08:49.846
There an angle in this
place you ain't workin'?

08:49.847 --> 08:52.264
Watch and learn, Mendoza.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.349
[clicks tongue]

08:53.350 --> 08:55.110
[Red chuckles]

08:55.936 --> 08:57.644
[exclaims sharply]

08:57.645 --> 09:00.356
The food lady from the TV got arrested!

09:00.357 --> 09:03.317
- Wait, what? Oh, shit, is it Nigella?
- Mmm-mmm.

09:03.318 --> 09:04.819
- The trashy one?
- Mmm-mmm.

09:04.820 --> 09:06.278
- The snotty one?
- Mmm-mmm.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.490
Ooh, it's the one with the plantation
kinda vibe goin' on, but in a fun way?

09:09.491 --> 09:11.283
- Yes!
- [laughs]

09:11.284 --> 09:14.536
- Yes! Had something to do with her taxes.
- [Poussey] Yeah, Judy King!

09:14.537 --> 09:17.749
There was microphones everywhere.
And they almost stuck one in her ear.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.416
Oh, Lord, if you're really out there,

09:19.417 --> 09:21.753
please, please, please
let her come to Litchfield.

09:21.754 --> 09:24.130
Please, please, please.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.473
[Crazy Eyes] Um...

09:26.299 --> 09:27.767
[Poussey] What?

09:29.302 --> 09:32.013
I think your laundry might be alive.

09:32.014 --> 09:35.516
Nah, that's that furry alkie
been stealing my jail juice!

09:35.517 --> 09:37.476
Yeah, I caught it this morning.

09:37.477 --> 09:40.062
I'll turn that punk into a hat. [laughs]

09:40.063 --> 09:41.230
What?

09:41.231 --> 09:44.867
Okay. We gonna have to talk.

09:46.111 --> 09:47.412
What?

09:49.990 --> 09:51.333
[sighs]

09:51.950 --> 09:54.118
So, stations one and two,

09:54.119 --> 09:57.914
you will be at the cutting tables
this morning cutting patterns.

09:57.915 --> 10:00.582
And then everyone else can
start assembling the pieces.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.961
We will switch out after
lunch to avoid fatigue.

10:03.962 --> 10:06.005
[Anita laughs]

10:06.006 --> 10:09.550
Look sharp, ladies. It's up to us to
help the lovers of the world get it on!

10:09.551 --> 10:11.103
[scatting]

10:12.763 --> 10:14.055
That's enough, DeMarco.

10:14.056 --> 10:17.058
Come on, Donaldson. Live a little, huh?

10:17.059 --> 10:18.976
Cut it out, okay?

10:18.977 --> 10:20.978
This shit's right up my alley.

10:20.979 --> 10:24.023
Sewed all my kids' clothes
until high school.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.033
- [chuckles]
- I bet they loved that.

10:28.528 --> 10:32.531
Man, somehow my khakis be
feelin' extra khaki right now.

10:32.532 --> 10:35.868
Oh, come on, Gonzales.
Looks are superficial.

10:35.869 --> 10:41.091
Everybody knows it's about talent,
originality, a sense of humor...

10:42.584 --> 10:45.502
[both snickering]

10:45.503 --> 10:50.091
[snorting] What do you think it's
like to be her in real life?

10:50.092 --> 10:52.927
Mmm, she eats pills and ice
cream, and cries at night.

10:52.928 --> 10:55.897
And she cuts herself, but on
her scalp so no one can see.

10:56.473 --> 10:58.265
So, it's still better than our lives.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.652
I would be her in a second.

11:06.316 --> 11:09.276
[sighs] White bitches, white bitches...
All right, check it.

11:09.277 --> 11:12.404
How many pages you think it is
before they put in a token blackie?

11:12.405 --> 11:16.450
And how dark is she, scale
of one to Grace Jones?

11:16.451 --> 11:19.620
All right, 14 and four.

11:19.621 --> 11:22.581
All right, 14 and four. Let's find out.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.208
[exclaims]

11:24.209 --> 11:27.419
- So close. Here she is, page 11.
- Oh, man!

11:27.420 --> 11:29.171
- Man, but that's not too bad.
- Mmm-hmm.

11:29.172 --> 11:31.558
But she, like, a two.

11:31.716 --> 11:33.717
- The bitch got blue eyes.
- Yeah, true.

11:33.718 --> 11:35.677
But, damn, look at her abs, though.

11:35.678 --> 11:37.013
I know, right?

11:37.014 --> 11:39.306
So I jump out the window.

11:39.307 --> 11:43.810
I fall two floors, I land
on the awning, I slide off.

11:43.811 --> 11:48.900
I grab the delivery boy's bicycle,
and I'm outta there. I'm gone.

11:48.901 --> 11:51.485
And that is how I pull off

11:51.486 --> 11:55.832
the biggest jewel heist
in Chandler, Arizona.

11:56.324 --> 11:59.743
I gotta say, you are the cutest
gunslinger I've ever met.

11:59.744 --> 12:01.870
[giggles] Thank you so much.

12:01.871 --> 12:03.414
And I do love guns.

12:03.415 --> 12:07.293
I mean, the old ones...
and the newer ones.

12:07.294 --> 12:10.046
I'm saving up for a 1962 Remington 700.

12:10.047 --> 12:11.255
That's the year they came out.

12:11.256 --> 12:14.341
Push-feed action,
3.2-millisecond lock time.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.468
Ooh! Just hearing you talk about that

12:16.469 --> 12:18.387
makes me want to go out
and shoot something.

12:18.388 --> 12:21.933
[groans] Now you're making me sad.

12:21.934 --> 12:24.819
You're never gonna be able
to buy a gun again, are you?

12:25.228 --> 12:26.437
What?

12:26.438 --> 12:31.826
As a convicted felon, you can't own a gun.

12:32.235 --> 12:33.620
Oh, right.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.913
Right!

12:36.364 --> 12:38.449
That is terrible, isn't it?

12:38.450 --> 12:41.660
I mean, that should be
a fundamental right.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.870
Like freedom of speech, right?

12:43.871 --> 12:46.457
I mean, what is happening to our country?

12:46.458 --> 12:48.209
It's the fall of Rome.

12:48.210 --> 12:51.721
[scoffs] Don't even get
me started on Rome.

12:53.381 --> 12:56.342
I've never written to an inmate before.
I didn't know what to expect.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.760
But you're... great.

12:58.761 --> 13:01.273
[sighs] You're great, too.

13:01.514 --> 13:02.681
Can I come see you again?

13:02.682 --> 13:05.267
I think that would be fine.

13:05.268 --> 13:07.603
Did you think we weren't gonna find out?

13:07.604 --> 13:11.940
I never found out. Nobody said
a damn word to me about an ad.

13:11.941 --> 13:13.985
All due respect, sir, but
I am gonna have to call

13:13.986 --> 13:16.112
a massive amount of bullshit on that.

13:16.113 --> 13:21.033
My kid's got asthma, and out of pocket,
her inhaler costs like $300 a month.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.618
I could get heroin for cheaper.

13:22.619 --> 13:24.745
- I understand.
- Do you?

13:24.746 --> 13:27.831
'Cause it seems like the only job
you saved around here was your own.

13:27.832 --> 13:30.667
You're still full-time. You
still have health insurance.

13:30.668 --> 13:36.173
You think that's what this is about, huh?
I got mine, now I'm gonna cut you loose?

13:36.174 --> 13:39.218
It doesn't not look like that, does it?

13:39.219 --> 13:42.939
I guess we can put the couch on
Airbnb to pay for your wrist surgery.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.400
Listen to me.

13:46.434 --> 13:49.978
Even if I didn't give two
shits about you clowns,

13:49.979 --> 13:51.897
which is not the case,

13:51.898 --> 13:54.733
I would still want to fix this
just to get you off my jock.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.152
I promise you.

13:56.153 --> 14:00.332
I think that was his way of saying
he cares what happens to us.

14:01.199 --> 14:02.408
Exactly.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.587
If you care about us, you should say it.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.954
Say you care about us.

14:07.955 --> 14:09.256
No.

14:09.874 --> 14:11.500
Say you love us.

14:11.501 --> 14:13.669
What? We're family in here.

14:13.670 --> 14:17.006
You love us and you're gonna
turn this thing around.

14:17.007 --> 14:18.433
Say it.

14:18.841 --> 14:20.393
[mutters indistinctly]

14:22.220 --> 14:23.938
[sighs]

14:25.015 --> 14:26.557
I...

14:26.558 --> 14:27.808
I love you.

14:27.809 --> 14:29.736
[Ford] That's more like it.

14:36.526 --> 14:38.610
[indistinct chatter]

14:38.611 --> 14:41.822
Hi, I would like a kosher meal, please.

14:41.823 --> 14:43.324
We got beef, noodles and peas.

14:43.325 --> 14:45.034
It's a religious thing.

14:45.035 --> 14:49.255
Which means Uncle Sam says you
gotta provide it when asked for.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.332
That's actually true.

14:51.333 --> 14:53.667
Well, we don't have it.

14:53.668 --> 14:55.961
Kosher's in extra deep freeze.

14:55.962 --> 14:59.215
Where it's been for months
because nobody ever asked for it

14:59.216 --> 15:03.094
when they were eating tasty,
nutritious Russian fusion.

15:03.095 --> 15:04.479
But now...

15:05.472 --> 15:07.774
this is what it's come to.

15:18.025 --> 15:20.370
Some tweaker wants kosher.

15:21.279 --> 15:24.990
We don't got enough to deal with
around here, now we got Jews?

15:24.991 --> 15:27.076
La Red says it's in the back.

15:27.077 --> 15:28.670
[chuckles]

15:46.679 --> 15:49.315
This actually looks pretty good.

15:52.102 --> 15:54.529
No noodles. All peas.

15:57.815 --> 16:01.368
- You want cake?
- Just peas. Two milk.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.397
Food is to be eaten in the cafeteria.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.399
Yeah, totally. I'm just
running out real quick.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.193
- I'm gonna come right back.
- Really?

16:42.194 --> 16:44.986
Or are you going to stash that
cake in your locker for later

16:44.987 --> 16:48.240
and then pretend you don't know
why there are roaches in B-Dorm?

16:48.241 --> 16:51.034
My dreams make me hungry.

16:51.035 --> 16:53.087
[sighs]

17:42.379 --> 17:43.930
[Brook groans]

17:44.130 --> 17:46.098
You know what sucks?

17:46.716 --> 17:49.801
Belonging to a race that doesn't
commit enough low-value crimes

17:49.802 --> 17:52.137
to be relevant in a place like this.

17:52.138 --> 17:54.556
Where's my big, Asian prison family?

17:54.557 --> 17:56.475
You Scottish.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.352
[Brook] Not to white people I'm not.

17:58.353 --> 18:00.186
One drop of ethnic blood and bam!

18:00.187 --> 18:03.189
I'm basically made in China,
like you and my toothbrush.

18:03.190 --> 18:04.951
You Scottish.

18:06.193 --> 18:08.621
- [sighing]
- [microwave beeping]

18:24.086 --> 18:26.430
[indistinct conversations]

18:48.611 --> 18:49.945
[doorbell jingles]

18:49.946 --> 18:51.863
[speaking Mandarin]
Seven million people in New York City

18:51.864 --> 18:53.990
and none of them in my shop.

18:53.991 --> 18:56.993
Maybe we could start doing
foot massages or something.

18:56.994 --> 18:58.078
Shit, you're right.

18:58.079 --> 19:00.289
Just like the three actual
massage places on this block.

19:00.290 --> 19:02.416
You're a marketing wizard.

19:02.417 --> 19:03.875
[doorbell jingles]

19:03.876 --> 19:08.297
Okay, we've got two boxes of dried sea
cucumber and a box of deer antlers.

19:08.298 --> 19:10.557
Really nice this time,

19:11.175 --> 19:12.468
from New Zealand.

19:12.469 --> 19:14.052
And?

19:14.053 --> 19:16.063
Where's my special delivery?

19:21.561 --> 19:24.238
We had a little setback.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.899
That idiot Zhang Bo got himself busted.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.818
I need this stuff, Deng.

19:29.819 --> 19:31.903
You think I make money on
fucking chrysanthemum tea?

19:31.904 --> 19:34.448
I have six people waiting on bear bile.

19:34.449 --> 19:38.369
The cops are all over the neighborhood,
stopping anyone suspicious.

19:38.370 --> 19:41.287
Your gall bladders are sitting
with 300 Gs worth of rhino horn

19:41.288 --> 19:43.874
in a storage unit in Flushing

19:43.875 --> 19:46.302
and we can't touch them.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.589
Look, this will blow over.
We wait a few months...

19:50.590 --> 19:53.392
A few months? No.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.808
Take Mei.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.527
Have her carry it.

20:04.979 --> 20:06.312
[both laughing]

20:06.313 --> 20:08.023
This is no job for a woman.

20:08.024 --> 20:09.941
It's a job for this woman.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.486
The whole time we've been talking,
she was standing right there.

20:12.487 --> 20:14.446
You never even looked at her.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.457
She's invisible.

20:17.158 --> 20:18.835
I can do it.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.049
[sewing machines whirring]

20:25.833 --> 20:27.634
[Black Cindy] Come on, man. God damn.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.553
Ugh.

20:30.212 --> 20:32.005
[groans] God damn it!

20:32.006 --> 20:34.090
[Flaca laughing]

20:34.091 --> 20:37.010
There's a one-legged chick out there
that's gonna be real grateful for that.

20:37.011 --> 20:39.388
Man, ain't you plannin' on doing
any sewin' while you here?

20:39.389 --> 20:42.441
I'll get to it. I'm like
the Flash with this shit.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.394
What page you gotta get to
before you see a Spanish girl?

20:45.395 --> 20:46.770
If you're talkin' about Latinas,

20:46.771 --> 20:49.773
there's, like, 20 different
countries that all look different.

20:49.774 --> 20:52.526
See this blond chick?
She could be Latina.

20:52.527 --> 20:53.902
- We don't know.
- [Black Cindy] Let me see.

20:53.903 --> 20:57.331
- Nah, she probably ain't though.
- No, probably not.

20:58.032 --> 21:00.742
Man, I gotta start running or something.

21:00.743 --> 21:03.119
Yeah, I ran all the time and
boys just thought I was weird.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.789
It's all Photoshopped anyway.

21:05.790 --> 21:10.335
Special lighting, tape and shit. We're
chasing an unachievable standard.

21:10.336 --> 21:12.045
I ain't chasin' nothin'.

21:12.046 --> 21:13.964
I'm a strong black woman,

21:13.965 --> 21:16.717
and we got a different standard
of beauty in our community.

21:16.718 --> 21:18.635
- Not true.
- Excuse me?

21:18.636 --> 21:21.680
- Beyoncé.
- Uh-uh. Don't you say nothin' about Bey.

21:21.681 --> 21:25.726
She ain't out there with her nappy
hair and her plus-size dashiki, okay?

21:25.727 --> 21:26.852
She playing a white girl game.

21:26.853 --> 21:27.936
And she winnin'.

21:27.937 --> 21:31.607
Winnin'! And you provin' my
point exactly, Morticia.

21:31.608 --> 21:34.275
There are hella ways for
black women to be beautiful.

21:34.276 --> 21:37.246
- A white girl, though...
- Mmm-hmm.

21:37.321 --> 21:39.832
[whispering] They just gotta be skinny.

21:40.116 --> 21:41.617
[Frieda] Ouch!

21:41.618 --> 21:45.411
Jesus H! That's the third time.

21:45.412 --> 21:47.998
Did you ever wear anything
like this, back in your day?

21:47.999 --> 21:50.125
- "In my day"?
- Mmm-hmm.

21:50.126 --> 21:51.502
That's kind of insulting.

21:51.503 --> 21:53.012
Sorry.

21:53.838 --> 21:57.048
In my day, I wore fuck all.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.341
[chuckles]

21:58.342 --> 22:01.145
You've either got to do it, or not.

22:02.096 --> 22:04.389
"Get to the banging."

22:04.390 --> 22:05.983
- Mmm.
- That's my philosophy.

22:07.101 --> 22:10.186
You know, I kinda like lingerie.

22:10.187 --> 22:13.273
I think it's less about
seducing someone else

22:13.274 --> 22:16.943
and more about feeling sexy yourself.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.654
I mean, I know it's ridiculous.

22:18.655 --> 22:21.665
But when it's not being
ridiculous, I think...

22:22.283 --> 22:25.086
I think it can make you feel...

22:26.913 --> 22:28.163
powerful.

22:28.164 --> 22:30.174
[Frieda and Stella laughing]

22:30.667 --> 22:31.750
What?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.293
You should hear yourself.

22:33.294 --> 22:34.878
It's like, "Help! I'm a skinny hot girl,

22:34.879 --> 22:37.881
but I need a little something
extra to make me feel sexy."

22:37.882 --> 22:40.842
If you knew me, you would know I
am definitely not the hot girl.

22:40.843 --> 22:42.343
"Help!

22:42.344 --> 22:47.057
The burden of my genetic perfection,
it's so heavy and so unfair."

22:47.058 --> 22:50.435
Genes are genes and they do not
take away from my God-given right

22:50.436 --> 22:53.354
to look in the mirror and
feel shitty about my thighs.

22:53.355 --> 22:57.525
You're tall and blond, and
your legs are up to your neck.

22:57.526 --> 22:59.912
Relax, enjoy it.

23:00.863 --> 23:03.699
I double majored in communications
and comparative literature.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.209
Of course you did.

23:05.952 --> 23:09.162
Why are Betties always going on
about how nerdy they really are?

23:09.163 --> 23:10.956
It's like, just fuckin' own it, you know?

23:10.957 --> 23:13.083
Like when rich people
pretend they're not rich.

23:13.084 --> 23:14.375
[Stella] Exactly.

23:14.376 --> 23:18.672
Maybe it's because Betties get
treated like they're... stupid.

23:18.673 --> 23:21.683
Well, then, don't be stupid.

23:22.885 --> 23:24.561
Women.

23:25.262 --> 23:27.639
And you don't consider yourself
a member of that category?

23:27.640 --> 23:28.941
I do.

23:29.558 --> 23:32.987
But only because my options are limited.

23:39.276 --> 23:42.195
So I dive out the window.
I fall two floors.

23:42.196 --> 23:44.572
I land splat on the awning.

23:44.573 --> 23:49.327
Jump down, grab the delivery
guy's bicycle and scram.

23:49.328 --> 23:53.707
And that is how I became
the most wanted arsonist

23:53.708 --> 23:55.792
in Winter Park, Florida.

23:55.793 --> 23:57.919
Shit, that is intense.

23:57.920 --> 24:02.298
Well, you know, life is intense.

24:02.299 --> 24:04.676
Sometimes you need an escape route.

24:04.677 --> 24:07.095
Well, I guess that's why
we both love anime.

24:07.096 --> 24:09.973
Right! Who doesn't need
a break from reality?

24:09.974 --> 24:13.601
My prison reality. Your
suburban Connecticut reality.

24:13.602 --> 24:16.521
Oh, last year I got into such
a huge fight at the Expo.

24:16.522 --> 24:17.814
Some dude's like,

24:17.815 --> 24:19.900
"If you got a horn on your
head, you can't be Pegasus.

24:19.901 --> 24:21.234
Pegasus isn't a unicorn."

24:21.235 --> 24:23.528
And I'm like, "In Sailor
Moon he is, bitch!"

24:23.529 --> 24:24.946
That shit got crazy.

24:24.947 --> 24:27.157
Oh, what a bitch!

24:27.158 --> 24:29.743
Yeah. What's your favorite anime?

24:29.744 --> 24:32.746
Oh, it's very obscure, you
probably haven't heard of it.

24:32.747 --> 24:33.830
[chuckles]

24:33.831 --> 24:38.177
It's this animal-human hybrid thing.

24:38.795 --> 24:43.298
It's by an artist named Dayanara Diaz.
It's really out there.

24:43.299 --> 24:45.142
I'll have to check it out.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.510
I like you, Lorna.

24:47.511 --> 24:50.055
And I like you, too, Ron.

24:50.056 --> 24:53.975
I'll be honest with you, the last girl
I met in this prison pen pal thing

24:53.976 --> 24:57.863
turned out to be... a little heavier.

24:58.314 --> 25:00.691
And... I don't go for that.

25:00.692 --> 25:04.110
But you've got a normal BMI
and a very symmetrical face.

25:04.111 --> 25:06.663
Oh, stop.

25:07.865 --> 25:11.159
[woman on PA]
MCC appreciates your honest feedback.

25:11.160 --> 25:14.463
We strive for excellence. Thank you.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.041
[scoffs]

25:18.042 --> 25:21.169
So now you're ignoring me, hmm?

25:21.170 --> 25:23.972
My son used to do this
when he was five.

25:26.342 --> 25:28.519
You tried to play me, Red.

25:29.846 --> 25:31.805
You were insincere,

25:31.806 --> 25:36.184
and you capitalized on my sensitivities.

25:36.185 --> 25:40.489
I want the kitchen back.
What other choice did I have?

25:41.440 --> 25:43.149
You could've asked me nicely.

25:43.150 --> 25:45.736
Aw, and that would have worked?

25:45.737 --> 25:47.070
Possibly.

25:47.071 --> 25:49.623
I'm a person. We're people.

25:51.117 --> 25:54.086
No one in here is people.

25:54.912 --> 25:58.289
You think this is a normal relationship?

25:58.290 --> 26:00.208
Human to human?

26:00.209 --> 26:03.804
I take advantage, you
get your feelings hurt.

26:05.339 --> 26:08.475
You forget that when you
leave here tonight,

26:08.801 --> 26:11.427
you lock me in behind you.

26:11.428 --> 26:14.606
Hey, I don't make the rules.

26:15.557 --> 26:18.018
You take a woman's power away.

26:18.019 --> 26:22.272
Her work, her family, her currency.

26:22.273 --> 26:24.575
You leave her with one coin...

26:25.484 --> 26:27.527
the one she was born with.

26:27.528 --> 26:30.696
It may be tawdry and demeaning,

26:30.697 --> 26:34.376
but if she has to, she will spend it.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.956
[inhales]

26:39.957 --> 26:42.134
But you're right.

26:42.501 --> 26:45.304
Your feelings count, too.

26:57.809 --> 27:00.894
I mean, you couldn't give a guy
a heads-up on this fiasco?

27:00.895 --> 27:04.656
I got COs up my ass like
a lemon-juice enema.

27:05.274 --> 27:08.234
Oh, like your mom never did it to you?
Come on.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.904
But I should have told you.

27:10.905 --> 27:13.656
One of those things. You know, you
get the call from upstairs...

27:13.657 --> 27:16.659
I probably found out five
minutes before you did.

27:16.660 --> 27:18.411
Yeah, well, it stinks.

27:18.412 --> 27:20.997
Yeah, well, I 100% get why
these guys are upset.

27:20.998 --> 27:22.665
But, on the other hand, you know,

27:22.666 --> 27:25.376
keeping tabs on that many
inmates takes a toll.

27:25.377 --> 27:29.505
These guys, uh, they start
making mistakes, you know.

27:29.506 --> 27:32.175
Cutting hours gives these
guys some down time.

27:32.176 --> 27:34.219
They rest up, they come in fresh...

27:34.220 --> 27:37.180
Yeah, to a job they no
longer give two shits about

27:37.181 --> 27:40.308
'cause you cut their benefits
and they're making bubkes.

27:40.309 --> 27:43.237
Good point, good point, you know, but...

27:44.688 --> 27:46.522
[exhales] Between you and me,

27:46.523 --> 27:49.484
I'm not too happy about this
whole thing, either. I mean...

27:49.485 --> 27:52.362
You obviously know more about
Litchfield than anybody.

27:52.363 --> 27:55.866
Who should be calling the shots?
You or some fucking corporate bigwig?

27:55.867 --> 27:59.119
The ad says all you need to
apply is a GED and no felonies.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.121
I mean, they really think
that's all it takes?

28:01.122 --> 28:03.840
Although, Luschek, am I right?

28:05.126 --> 28:08.512
[sighs] Yeah, I don't
know how that happened.

28:09.922 --> 28:13.925
I gotta tell you, Pearson, the last
few years have been a rough ride.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.977
I've been through the shit.

28:16.678 --> 28:18.272
Can we get two more of these?

28:19.891 --> 28:20.974
[Pearson] I tell you what.

28:20.975 --> 28:25.896
The applications have been
coming to me, which is crazy.

28:25.897 --> 28:29.357
You should be doing the hiring.
You know exactly what you need.

28:29.358 --> 28:32.911
Who knows, maybe you'll find
some hidden gems in there.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.739
I guess you never know.

28:36.740 --> 28:39.293
Yeah. That's the spirit.

28:42.872 --> 28:44.497
My neck is fuckin' killing me.

28:44.498 --> 28:47.008
Hell yeah. Sewing is no joke.

28:48.920 --> 28:52.547
Uh... Hey, what you got on your tray?

28:52.548 --> 28:56.051
Eggs and some kind of tomato sauce.

28:56.052 --> 28:59.137
I did not see no eggs up there.
You see eggs?

28:59.138 --> 29:00.471
Mmm-mmm. I did not see eggs.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.098
It's kosher. You gotta ask for it.

29:02.099 --> 29:05.685
"Kosher"? Like some pickles, "kosher"?

29:05.686 --> 29:08.354
No, there's all these
Jewish laws about food.

29:08.355 --> 29:11.232
Kosher means they obeyed all the laws.

29:11.233 --> 29:12.784
They make it special.

29:13.194 --> 29:15.028
Well, you don't look Jewish to me.

29:15.029 --> 29:17.697
I'm Lutheran. From Norway.

29:17.698 --> 29:21.409
But they're not allowed to ask you about
that on account of the Holocaust,

29:21.410 --> 29:23.295
so I don't say shit.

29:24.038 --> 29:25.339
Ugh.

29:25.831 --> 29:27.958
Uh-uh. This changes everything.

29:27.959 --> 29:31.794
My back is in spasm and
all of my fingers hurt.

29:31.795 --> 29:34.005
Wait, have you been cheating on me?

29:34.006 --> 29:37.017
I have been touching many panties.

29:37.801 --> 29:41.313
Which reminds me.
I brought you a souvenir.

29:43.182 --> 29:44.807
Meet your new bunkie.

29:44.808 --> 29:47.893
She's damaged in all the right ways
and has big naturals.

29:47.894 --> 29:49.354
I call her Lola.

29:49.355 --> 29:51.490
You get everything about me.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.151
Whoa! Hold up.

29:55.152 --> 29:57.445
These bras cost $90?

29:57.446 --> 29:59.614
I know, right? And I get 45 cents
to make them.

29:59.615 --> 30:01.199
It's basically slave labor.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.742
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:02.743 --> 30:04.953
You do not get to say
what's slavery, okay?

30:04.954 --> 30:06.829
- Mmm-mmm.
- I get to say what's slavery.

30:06.830 --> 30:08.789
And PS, technically,

30:08.790 --> 30:10.833
- it's more like indentured servitude.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:10.834 --> 30:12.793
[Black Cindy]
Y'all don't know about that slave life.

30:12.794 --> 30:16.256
We makin' a dollar an hour.
That's like 10 times what we got before.

30:16.257 --> 30:19.842
But the other jobs
are about prison upkeep.

30:19.843 --> 30:22.563
The Whispers people
are profiting from this.

30:23.139 --> 30:25.566
- I'm okay with that.
- Mmm-hmm. Me too.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.059
Your oatmeal's getting cold.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.311
Do you know anything about birds?

30:30.312 --> 30:31.896
What, like birds in general?

30:31.897 --> 30:33.106
[Lorna] Anything.

30:33.107 --> 30:36.401
Well, owls eat whole mice
and then throw up the bones.

30:36.402 --> 30:37.943
- [Piper] Mmm-hmm.
- Big Bird is yellow,

30:37.944 --> 30:41.239
coq Au vin is delicious,

30:41.240 --> 30:43.116
and you're being crazy right now.

30:43.117 --> 30:45.336
Oh, everybody needs a hobby.

30:45.911 --> 30:49.830
Morello, think about the kind of guys
who write to women in prison.

30:49.831 --> 30:53.209
I mean, if you want a boyfriend,
you might wanna fish in a different pool.

30:53.210 --> 30:56.379
No, no, no, no, no.
It is not about that.

30:56.380 --> 30:58.589
It is a straight up moneymaking thing.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.633
You get one of these bozos on the hook,

31:00.634 --> 31:04.429
and they are just throwing money
in your commissary, throwing it in.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.639
All right. Well, if that's all it is.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.016
But you don't have to do this.

31:08.017 --> 31:10.935
I mean, Chapman's hauling
in so much bank now,

31:10.936 --> 31:13.113
she's gonna buy us all a pony.

32:11.205 --> 32:13.214
[people speaking Mandarin]

32:36.813 --> 32:38.449
[chuckles]

32:58.627 --> 32:59.928
[inmate] Uh-oh.

33:00.962 --> 33:02.713
Not cool.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.766
Throw it back.

33:07.928 --> 33:09.855
[Maureen] What a dick.

33:12.808 --> 33:13.933
[Fu chuckles]

33:13.934 --> 33:19.063
[speaking Mandarin] It's a dance,
but you just walk backward.

33:19.064 --> 33:22.325
And your feet don't ever leave the ground.

33:25.862 --> 33:27.655
That's not a dance.

33:27.656 --> 33:29.782
- Says who?
- Says me.

33:29.783 --> 33:31.585
Well, you're not in charge.

33:32.203 --> 33:35.756
Is this why you bought
those penny-loafers?

33:37.874 --> 33:39.625
[sighs]

33:39.626 --> 33:41.970
Where the fuck is this guy?

33:42.713 --> 33:44.422
- Fu.
- Hmm.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.632
Does this stuff really work?

33:46.633 --> 33:48.018
Which stuff?

33:48.510 --> 33:50.720
The stuff. For men.

33:50.721 --> 33:54.056
I've been with you guys for months
now and it's like half the business:

33:54.057 --> 33:56.485
The penis soup, the snake blood...

33:57.728 --> 34:03.483
Maybe it's not whether it works,
but whether you think it works.

34:03.484 --> 34:08.152
But it's like nobody in
China can get a boner.

34:08.154 --> 34:09.655
That can't be true.

34:09.656 --> 34:14.335
It's more about feeling powerful.

34:16.079 --> 34:18.623
I have this American girlfriend.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.833
Taller than I am, with yellow hair,

34:21.835 --> 34:23.762
she smokes these thin cigarettes.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.347
Scares the shit out of me.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.520
Men are dumb.

34:32.346 --> 34:34.264
[vehicle approaching]

34:34.264 --> 34:35.389
Ah! Ni Kan.

34:35.391 --> 34:36.942
Finally.

34:51.114 --> 34:53.866
[speaking English]
Hey, Park, I thought you died.

34:53.867 --> 34:56.085
Just get your shit, man.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.925
Big turtles. Venezuela.

35:05.086 --> 35:06.512
Okay.

35:14.054 --> 35:16.064
[Fu sighs]

35:21.978 --> 35:23.145
[speaking Mandarin] Fu.

35:23.146 --> 35:24.689
They're Ping-Pong balls.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.491
Huh? Shenme?

35:27.859 --> 35:29.661
[grunting]

35:36.452 --> 35:37.961
[metal scraping]

35:38.912 --> 35:40.421
[gun cocks]

35:44.376 --> 35:45.761
[Fu coughs]

35:49.798 --> 35:51.642
[speaking Mandarin] Fucking Koreans.

35:53.469 --> 35:58.023
You might have saved my life, Mei.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.904
I owe you.

36:04.855 --> 36:06.782
I know what I want.

36:08.692 --> 36:10.786
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

36:11.445 --> 36:16.616
So my new applicant pool is basically
the cast of fucking Animal House.

36:16.617 --> 36:19.544
I'd cry for you, but I'm
all out of Kleenex.

36:20.161 --> 36:23.122
I gotta play the game, okay?
Look at what they send me.

36:23.123 --> 36:27.460
This guy's total work experience,
seven months in a Radio Shack

36:27.461 --> 36:29.879
that he ended up leaving for
"creative differences,"

36:29.880 --> 36:32.808
which probably means
he's got a Nazi tattoo.

36:33.634 --> 36:34.842
Look, this guy,

36:34.843 --> 36:37.928
he answered, "Have you ever
been convicted of a felony?"

36:37.929 --> 36:39.680
with, "It's complicated."

36:39.681 --> 36:44.268
Hey, you know who has a ton of
work experience and a clean record

36:44.269 --> 36:46.437
and who wants a job here?

36:46.438 --> 36:50.158
Fucking me. I even have a
uniform and everything.

36:52.403 --> 36:54.612
- Let's get through this, Maxwell.
- [sighs]

36:54.613 --> 36:56.697
I'm gonna show them
that I'm a good pawn

36:56.698 --> 36:57.990
and that I'm willing to play ball.

36:57.991 --> 36:59.492
And then in a few months, I tell them,

36:59.493 --> 37:04.214
"Look, we tried it your way.
Now, I need my guys full-time."

37:05.206 --> 37:07.258
I miss Fig.

37:08.919 --> 37:11.262
Right. Right.

37:12.423 --> 37:15.090
Send one of these jokers
back to my office.

37:15.091 --> 37:16.175
Which one?

37:16.176 --> 37:17.811
Thrill me.

37:19.137 --> 37:21.263
[Healy] Hey! Hey, boss man.

37:21.264 --> 37:23.223
I got interviews, Healy.

37:23.224 --> 37:25.861
With those yahoos in the lobby? Yikes.

37:26.352 --> 37:28.438
I don't envy your job today.

37:28.439 --> 37:30.230
I've never felt closer to you.

37:30.231 --> 37:35.486
Hey, listen, I don't know what else
these MCC goons got up their sleeve,

37:35.487 --> 37:38.363
but I want you to know I got
full confidence in you.

37:38.364 --> 37:42.242
I know you're doing the best that you can.
I can see that.

37:42.243 --> 37:43.411
Thank you.

37:43.412 --> 37:45.871
Us old-timers gotta stick together, okay?

37:45.872 --> 37:47.966
I got your back all the way.

37:50.461 --> 37:52.220
I appreciate that.

37:53.213 --> 37:55.214
Good luck, all right?

37:55.215 --> 37:58.852
Oh, hey, uh, do me a favor and
sign this real quick for me.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.641
You want Reznikov back in the kitchen?

38:05.642 --> 38:07.893
She was running a whole
black market outta there.

38:07.894 --> 38:09.144
Yeah, but that wasn't proven.

38:09.145 --> 38:10.771
And we got all new vendors
in the kitchen now.

38:10.772 --> 38:14.525
And don't forget, we just lost
Gonzales to the underwear people.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.193
[sighs] I don't know.
I don't know, Healy.

38:16.194 --> 38:17.277
I'll keep an eye on her.

38:17.278 --> 38:20.531
She'll start off in the bottom,
washing dishes, doing the onions.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.667
We got a lot bigger problems, here, man.

38:24.495 --> 38:25.995
[pen scribbles]

38:25.996 --> 38:28.748
Do not mistake my kindness
for weakness, Counselor.

38:28.749 --> 38:29.915
[pen clacks]

38:29.916 --> 38:32.928
I'll keep that in mind. Side Boob!

38:40.093 --> 38:42.062
[sewing machines whirring]

38:54.190 --> 38:55.491
[Piper] Huh.

38:55.692 --> 38:57.327
Uh, Mr. Brand?

38:58.278 --> 39:03.282
You know, if you smush these patterns
just a little bit closer together,

39:03.283 --> 39:07.703
you can actually get an extra
Lacy Low-Rider Indiscretion bikini

39:07.704 --> 39:09.789
from the same piece of fabric.

39:09.790 --> 39:12.592
Thanks for your advice, inmate.

39:13.251 --> 39:15.178
It was really more of an observation.

39:15.546 --> 39:20.433
Let's just assume that Whispers Inc.
knows how they want to make panties, okay?

39:23.679 --> 39:24.845
[Stella] See?

39:24.846 --> 39:28.817
Even C-minus-looking people can be stupid.
[chuckles]

39:36.567 --> 39:37.900
You closin' up?

39:37.901 --> 39:39.359
I got time for one more.

39:39.360 --> 39:40.996
I need my neck shaved.

39:41.446 --> 39:43.948
No one ever wants
anything fun around here.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.324
I'm guessing fun, to you,

39:45.325 --> 39:48.077
means a 2-foot poufy thing
with a birdcage in it?

39:48.078 --> 39:52.331
And what would be so terrible about that?
I mean, especially in a place like this.

39:52.332 --> 39:55.793
We could use some...
some originality, some sass.

39:55.794 --> 39:58.554
Mmm-mmm. Not getting
noticed is my main goal.

39:59.172 --> 40:02.382
[sighs] Sass is what lands you in Seg.

40:02.383 --> 40:04.134
[Sophia chuckles] I feel that.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.511
[laughing] Really? 'Cause
you doin' the opposite.

40:06.512 --> 40:10.015
You got this whole thing going
on, the hair, the makeup...

40:10.016 --> 40:13.936
I mean, who has the energy to
go full MAC counter every day?

40:13.937 --> 40:19.024
Listen, after all I went through to be
me, I'm not about to let shit slide.

40:19.025 --> 40:22.653
Yeah, but you all up in our face with
it, like all blown out and shit.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.780
Look, if you wanted to
look like a real woman,

40:24.781 --> 40:29.252
you would let your roots grow out
and get some bags under your eyes.

40:30.328 --> 40:33.789
You know, historically,
me and reality...

40:33.790 --> 40:35.332
not friends.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.126
Mmm. You got me there.

40:37.127 --> 40:40.713
This one time, I'm getting on
the Metro-North to head home,

40:40.714 --> 40:42.172
and this mouth-breather,

40:42.173 --> 40:44.216
this mouth-breather
comes right up behind me

40:44.217 --> 40:45.384
and smacks me on the ass.

40:45.385 --> 40:47.720
- And I'm thinking...
- I'm sorry, could you go back a second

40:47.721 --> 40:50.190
to the part where you're
on the Metro-North?

40:50.431 --> 40:51.515
What about it?

40:51.516 --> 40:53.934
- Where you live?
- Yonkers.

40:53.935 --> 40:56.228
Childhood home of
Mary J. Blige and Anthrax.

40:56.229 --> 41:00.107
[chuckles] You know that my son, you
know, Benny, he's in the Bronx.

41:00.108 --> 41:01.233
Mmm-hmm.

41:01.234 --> 41:02.484
Yeah.

41:02.485 --> 41:04.569
You think that maybe, um...

41:04.570 --> 41:07.572
he could ride up here
sometimes with your wife?

41:07.573 --> 41:08.741
You know, for visitation.

41:08.742 --> 41:11.461
'Cause he could take the
bus to their house.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.755
I'll ask her.

41:15.123 --> 41:16.424
[chuckles]

41:17.542 --> 41:19.334
I'm feeling sassier already.

41:19.335 --> 41:21.471
- Mmm-hmm?
- [chuckles]

41:21.922 --> 41:24.849
Glad you could come out for a real visit?

41:25.550 --> 41:27.310
Nice drive.

41:28.428 --> 41:32.607
First time in prison's always weird.
You must feel like a starling.

41:33.433 --> 41:35.184
A what now?

41:35.185 --> 41:37.102
A common starling.

41:37.103 --> 41:39.354
You know, how they weren't
native to America

41:39.355 --> 41:42.107
and then that guy Eugene
brought them over,

41:42.108 --> 41:44.869
'cause he wanted it to be
like Shakespeare's time.

41:46.487 --> 41:48.539
Right, sure.

41:50.491 --> 41:54.078
I think I saw a hermit thrush, yesterday.

41:54.079 --> 41:57.340
At least, I think it was a hermit thrush.
It was all by itself.

41:57.958 --> 41:59.759
My uncle had a parakeet.

42:00.626 --> 42:04.180
Knew how to swear in Italian,
but he shit all over the house.

42:07.759 --> 42:10.645
You're not that into
birds, are you?

42:11.637 --> 42:15.566
Got nothing against them, but mostly
I'm into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

42:16.309 --> 42:17.860
Like I wrote you.

42:18.228 --> 42:22.064
Oh, sure, Jiu-Jitsu.
Everybody loves Jiu-Jitsu.

42:22.065 --> 42:23.699
It's delicious.

42:26.903 --> 42:28.779
You wanna tell me what's going on here?

42:28.780 --> 42:31.866
No, nothing, nothing. Nothing's going on.
It was just a little misunderstanding...

42:31.867 --> 42:33.408
You think I'm some bird guy?

42:33.409 --> 42:35.160
- No.
- What is this? Is this a scam?

42:35.161 --> 42:36.829
Trying to get money or something?

42:36.830 --> 42:38.122
No, no, no, no, no!
It's not about money...

42:38.123 --> 42:39.498
I'm supposed to believe that?

42:39.499 --> 42:42.635
You're the top contract killer
in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

42:43.628 --> 42:45.462
Look...

42:45.463 --> 42:48.215
the only person that cared about me,

42:48.216 --> 42:51.102
they took her away to Max.

42:52.303 --> 42:54.314
And I'm so lonely.

42:54.514 --> 42:59.059
[voice breaking] And I thought,
if I wrote to enough people,

42:59.060 --> 43:02.572
then maybe I would find
somebody and, oh... [sobbing]

43:03.398 --> 43:06.576
I watched so much Discovery Channel.

43:07.652 --> 43:09.037
[sniffles]

43:11.281 --> 43:12.873
[man sighs]

43:15.994 --> 43:17.503
Hold up, hey.

43:18.413 --> 43:19.797
Hey.

43:22.751 --> 43:25.678
I don't care how many
other guys you wrote.

43:26.296 --> 43:29.057
I'm just glad I get to meet you.

43:30.591 --> 43:32.017
[sighs]

43:33.386 --> 43:38.849
"I'm glad you confronted me about
your feelings, Gina-bo-bina.

43:38.850 --> 43:43.938
I see now that the way I
treated you was wrong."

43:43.939 --> 43:46.031
"Thank you, Mom.

43:46.357 --> 43:50.078
I feel so much better
about our relationship.

43:50.779 --> 43:53.831
If you weren't dead, I'd hug you."

43:54.532 --> 43:58.753
"I think you forgot that
anything is possible...

44:00.121 --> 44:02.507
in your imagination."

44:03.666 --> 44:05.343
You hug. You hug.

44:06.419 --> 44:07.803
Oh.

44:10.173 --> 44:12.341
[Rogers] Very nice, ladies.

44:12.342 --> 44:16.095
And a big hand to Gina who shared
a piece of her life with us.

44:16.096 --> 44:18.013
[scattered applause]

44:18.014 --> 44:20.975
Dead is dead is gone forever.

44:20.976 --> 44:23.518
You don't say that you
can still give hugs.

44:23.519 --> 44:25.280
It's irresponsible.

44:26.189 --> 44:27.272
Because you can't.

44:27.273 --> 44:30.109
You regularly talk to a mop.

44:30.110 --> 44:31.318
[inmate] Burn!

44:31.319 --> 44:32.870
[Rogers] Okay.

44:33.113 --> 44:34.497
Okay.

44:36.491 --> 44:38.209
[Gina whispers] You did great.

44:39.077 --> 44:40.670
Who's next?

44:43.664 --> 44:45.883
Come on...

44:46.459 --> 44:48.719
Anyone?

44:52.173 --> 44:53.683
[man grunting]

45:00.932 --> 45:02.567
Ahh!

45:09.149 --> 45:10.491
Ahh!

45:10.901 --> 45:12.410
[coughing]

45:17.240 --> 45:19.900
[Fu speaking Mandarin] This is
the fuckwad who rejected you?

45:20.076 --> 45:24.004
It's not like I'm looking
at God's gift here.

45:24.747 --> 45:26.299
Right?

45:27.625 --> 45:28.959
I remember you.

45:28.960 --> 45:33.223
What do you want us to do with him?

45:37.468 --> 45:40.179
[imitating Chang]
"Cut out his gall bladder!"

45:40.180 --> 45:43.015
"Please, no! I was dummy.

45:43.016 --> 45:45.309
- I made big mistake.
- [chuckles]

45:45.310 --> 45:49.396
You are strong and
beautiful, like a horse.

45:49.397 --> 45:51.190
Please, forgive me."

45:51.191 --> 45:53.534
[laughing maniacally]

45:54.610 --> 45:56.787
"Too late for sorry, now.

45:57.738 --> 45:59.323
[stutters]

45:59.324 --> 46:01.208
Kill him!"

46:01.492 --> 46:06.839
[Angie] "I must die now for
being the worst person.

46:07.165 --> 46:10.385
I accept your wisdom.

46:11.086 --> 46:12.720
Girl power."

46:15.256 --> 46:17.132
[gurgling]

46:17.133 --> 46:18.934
[imitates blood spurting]

46:20.386 --> 46:22.429
- [laughing]
- [inmates exclaiming]

46:22.430 --> 46:25.724
"And now I eat his... " [sighs]

46:25.725 --> 46:28.727
Okay, I don't feel comfortable saying this.
It's disgusting.

46:28.728 --> 46:30.729
Okay, okay. We can stop here.

46:30.730 --> 46:33.607
I did say to re-imagine old resentments,

46:33.608 --> 46:36.452
but I think you took this a little
too far to be constructive.

46:37.403 --> 46:38.612
I liked it.

46:38.613 --> 46:40.623
[inmates murmuring]

46:49.249 --> 46:50.716
All fake.

46:51.334 --> 46:52.802
Showbiz.

46:53.336 --> 46:55.513
Yeah, see...

47:01.886 --> 47:03.887
Hey, Big Talkin' Missy.

47:03.888 --> 47:05.972
Out of the kitchen, into the sweatshop.

47:05.973 --> 47:07.807
Turns out your mobility
ain't so upwards, huh?

47:07.808 --> 47:09.684
Fuck off, Ruiz.

47:09.685 --> 47:11.728
At least my hair doesn't
smell like a deep fryer.

47:11.729 --> 47:12.979
[chuckles]

47:12.980 --> 47:16.033
Uh-uh. I'm gonna eat one of them
kosher meals y'all got back there.

47:16.859 --> 47:17.984
You ain't even Jewish.

47:17.985 --> 47:20.371
You think you know my life?

47:21.114 --> 47:23.532
- Fine.
- [Black Cindy] Yeah.

47:23.533 --> 47:25.460
Shabbat shalom, bitch.

47:26.411 --> 47:28.787
How much longer you gonna stay mad?

47:28.788 --> 47:32.374
Man, do you know how hard it is to
get a squirrel into a laundry bag?

47:32.375 --> 47:33.917
[laughs] No.

47:33.918 --> 47:36.753
I took it a little too far,
hooch jacking you.

47:36.754 --> 47:40.132
But you was pissin' and settin'
traps like Elmer Fudd.

47:40.133 --> 47:42.810
Man, the shit was funny.
[laughs]

47:45.971 --> 47:48.515
But also, I was worried about you.

47:48.516 --> 47:50.725
Well, you know, if I
was worried about you,

47:50.726 --> 47:53.187
I'd have made you some
goddamn soup or something.

47:53.188 --> 47:54.947
Excellent point.

47:55.565 --> 47:58.108
But you think you might want to
cut down on the sauce, though?

47:58.109 --> 48:00.026
Like, just to make sure you can?

48:00.027 --> 48:02.612
- I ain't hurtin' nobody.
- Um... [taps fork]

48:02.613 --> 48:05.490
Excuse me, Miss Poussey?
This is your liver speakin'...

48:05.491 --> 48:08.293
It just makes me feel better, okay?

48:09.954 --> 48:12.382
It makes me feel like I
can get through this.

48:15.418 --> 48:17.052
Come with me to AA.

48:17.462 --> 48:19.296
- [scoffs]
- Come on, man. It'll be fun.

48:19.297 --> 48:21.465
You ain't even a addict!

48:21.466 --> 48:24.801
You just make up crazy stories about
shit that ain't even happened.

48:24.802 --> 48:25.927
- So?
- And then everybody

48:25.928 --> 48:28.180
gotta listen to you. It's
your personal open mic night.

48:28.181 --> 48:32.392
Well, instead of poetry slam,
it's like poetry slammer.

48:32.393 --> 48:33.518
No.

48:33.519 --> 48:36.521
[imitating Cinque] Come on,
like, "Give us, us freestyle."

48:36.522 --> 48:39.233
Oh, you pullin' out the
Amistad, now. Damn.

48:39.234 --> 48:40.660
[chuckles]

48:41.611 --> 48:42.986
[clears throat]

48:42.987 --> 48:46.331
I just feel like this
place is beatin' me down.

48:48.784 --> 48:51.953
I don't need no audience to talk at.

48:51.954 --> 48:53.338
[chuckles]

48:54.874 --> 48:57.259
I need a girlfriend.

48:59.337 --> 49:01.305
Like, a real one.

49:01.881 --> 49:03.265
You know?

49:06.136 --> 49:07.562
Love.

49:11.474 --> 49:15.894
[woman on PA] MCC is looking to train
you for your job on the outside.

49:15.895 --> 49:18.280
See human resources.

49:27.282 --> 49:28.749
No!

49:30.034 --> 49:31.669
[breathing heavily]

49:33.163 --> 49:35.539
O'Neill, I hired a new guard.

49:35.540 --> 49:37.166
First of many.

49:37.167 --> 49:40.678
And I'm gonna need you guys
to show him the ropes.

49:42.463 --> 49:44.474
Help yourself.

49:48.553 --> 49:50.720
Red velvet is shit.

49:50.721 --> 49:52.607
[toilet flushes]

49:57.102 --> 49:58.937
You like Bo Derek.

49:58.938 --> 50:01.240
Tarzan, 1981.

50:02.942 --> 50:05.995
Please pretend that you
didn't just see this.

50:08.072 --> 50:10.199
I don't see nothing.

50:10.200 --> 50:12.710
I just wanted to feel pretty.

50:21.252 --> 50:22.928
Chang?

50:25.465 --> 50:28.518
I'm... sorry about the other day.

50:30.345 --> 50:32.688
Thank you, lesbian.

50:40.646 --> 50:43.699
[speaking Mandarin] What do
you want us to do with him?

50:50.197 --> 50:54.168
You will always be an ugly
girl who no one wants.

50:54.785 --> 50:57.287
Whether I live

50:57.288 --> 50:59.248
or die,

50:59.249 --> 51:01.551
nothing will change that.

51:04.420 --> 51:06.096
He's right.

51:09.759 --> 51:11.435
Nothing will change.

51:12.928 --> 51:14.220
Mei!

51:14.221 --> 51:15.898
What should we do with him?

51:17.683 --> 51:19.694
Should we let him go?

51:22.688 --> 51:24.323
Nah.

51:25.775 --> 51:27.577
Cut out his gall bladder.

51:29.654 --> 51:30.945
[man yelling] No!

51:30.946 --> 51:33.332
- [knife plunges]
- [man screaming]

51:57.139 --> 52:00.150
Ay, coño. Hey! Cuidado.

52:11.028 --> 52:12.747
I'm back.
