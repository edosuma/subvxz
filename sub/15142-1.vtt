NARRATOR:
<i>Last season</i>
<i>on</i> East Los High:

00:02.270 --> 00:04.475
CECI:
<i>I don’t know how to make</i>
<i>those girls listen to me.</i>

00:04.541 --> 00:05.744
Start loosening up
with some stretches.

00:05.810 --> 00:08.014
You just had a baby.
Aren’t you stretched out enough.

00:08.281 --> 00:09.918
CECI:
<i>I was ready to snatch</i>
<i>those bitches up,</i>

00:09.985 --> 00:12.623
but then Jacob was, like,
calm down and play it cool.

00:12.690 --> 00:14.761
Wait, Jacob
was coming on to you?

00:14.827 --> 00:17.533
It’s a dance.
People go to a dance to dance.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.302
Get your hands off me.

00:19.369 --> 00:21.875
You’re lucky I don’t throw
your ass out on the street.

00:21.941 --> 00:24.579
JOCELYN:
<i>I never done anything</i>
<i>like that with a girl.</i>

00:24.646 --> 00:26.383
But it felt good,
didn’t it?

00:26.450 --> 00:28.654
What’s up, sis?
Nicolas!

00:28.721 --> 00:30.424
WOMAN:
<i>You remember Camila,</i>
<i>don’t you?</i>

00:30.490 --> 00:31.692
NICOLAS:
<i>How can I forget?</i>

00:31.759 --> 00:33.363
CAMILA:
<i>Don’t waste time.</i>

00:33.430 --> 00:35.667
Don’t play dumb, Nic.
I didn’t know about the drugs.

00:35.734 --> 00:37.838
And now you’re in,
big-time.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.407
( tires screech )

00:39.474 --> 00:42.914
WOMAN 2: <i>What happened?</i>
<i>
You stay the hell away from us!</i>

00:42.980 --> 00:44.317
The monster’s back.

00:44.384 --> 00:45.453
<i>( man speaks in Spanish )</i>

00:45.519 --> 00:47.590
Aren’t you gonna say hello
to your father?

00:47.657 --> 00:51.597
ANNOUNCER:
<i>The team going to</i>
<i>the regional final is</i>

00:51.664 --> 00:52.999
East Los High!

00:53.066 --> 00:54.869
( crowd cheering )

00:54.936 --> 00:57.976
Ceci Camayo,
will you marry me?

01:02.918 --> 01:05.556
GIRLS ( chanting ):
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:08.629 --> 01:11.068
GIRL:
Say yes, say yes, say yes!

01:11.301 --> 01:12.504
Yes.

01:12.570 --> 01:16.344
( all cheering )

01:24.092 --> 01:26.998
JOCELYN:
You can’t keep
this secret.

01:27.064 --> 01:28.968
Look what it’s
doing to you.

01:29.035 --> 01:30.037
( winces )

01:30.104 --> 01:33.343
Cutting isn’t gonna
make it better.

01:35.981 --> 01:38.085
( door opens )

01:42.661 --> 01:43.763
Where’s Gina?

01:43.829 --> 01:45.766
She’s in her room.
What was she thinking?

01:45.832 --> 01:47.971
Running off with her father.
Where’s that son of a bitch?

01:48.038 --> 01:50.509
I’m gonna kill him.
CAMILA: He’s gone.

01:50.576 --> 01:51.844
Of course he’s gone!

01:51.911 --> 01:54.516
<i>Ese cabron</i> owes me
seven years of child support.

01:54.583 --> 01:55.885
Gina!

01:58.824 --> 02:00.995
Please, let’s get outta here.

02:01.062 --> 02:03.767
Come on. You can
stay at my place.

02:03.834 --> 02:10.447
( indistinct yelling
in next room )

02:10.513 --> 02:11.682
SERGIO:
You sure this is it?

02:11.749 --> 02:13.418
NICOLAS:
I swear, it’s all in the car.

02:13.485 --> 02:15.722
I was just a driver, man.
Shut that shit up.

02:15.789 --> 02:17.660
Man, you got your--
Shut up, bitch.

02:19.697 --> 02:21.935
Can I go, man?
You got all your dope.

02:22.002 --> 02:25.774
What you think, I’m gonna
drive this shit to Vegas?

02:25.842 --> 02:27.612
You gotta keep delivering

02:27.679 --> 02:29.516
so the clients think
it’s business as usual.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.085
What? Until when?

02:31.152 --> 02:32.454
Until we say so.

02:32.522 --> 02:33.658
( cocks gun )

02:33.724 --> 02:35.626
Any more questions,

02:35.693 --> 02:37.531
you gonna end up like Remy.

02:37.598 --> 02:39.167
Remy who?

02:39.435 --> 02:41.506
( laughter )

JAZMINE:
I like me in this one.

03:28.461 --> 03:30.431
I wonder if I can get this
shortened?

03:30.498 --> 03:32.602
Any shorter and you’re gonna
need a Brazilian.

03:32.668 --> 03:33.670
I love Brazilians.

03:33.737 --> 03:36.575
I hope he looks like
Cristiano Ronaldo.

03:37.678 --> 03:39.749
So, what do you think?

03:39.816 --> 03:42.621
Oh my God, Ceci!
That’s the dress!

03:42.687 --> 03:44.524
Ceci, you look like princess.

03:44.590 --> 03:47.731
Get it, Coach Ceci.

03:47.798 --> 03:49.735
I freaking love it.

03:49.802 --> 03:51.237
Hey, will you take
a picture with my phone?

03:51.504 --> 03:53.141
I wanna send it to Pedro.
Are you crazy?

03:53.208 --> 03:55.076
The groom’s not supposed
to see your dress.

03:55.143 --> 03:56.480
That’s bad luck.

03:56.547 --> 03:57.716
Not when he’s
paying for it.

03:57.783 --> 04:00.688
All right.

04:00.755 --> 04:02.592
Okay, ready?

04:02.659 --> 04:03.594
Smile!

04:03.661 --> 04:05.697
Okay,
got it.

04:05.764 --> 04:07.669
Girl, you look good.

04:07.735 --> 04:08.871
Thank you.

04:08.938 --> 04:10.774
NICOLAS:
I wanted to do
something special.

04:10.842 --> 04:13.213
You know, you guys have
done so much for me.

04:13.479 --> 04:14.614
<i>Es tan bueno, mi amor.</i>

04:14.681 --> 04:16.618
A brand new TV!

04:16.685 --> 04:18.222
You make us so proud.

04:18.488 --> 04:19.792
I told you my music
was gonna pay off.

04:19.859 --> 04:21.728
JOCELYN:
What music’s that?

04:21.795 --> 04:24.700
Gangsta rap or <i>narcocorridos?</i>

04:26.737 --> 04:29.543
Hold up, Joce.
Chill!

04:29.610 --> 04:30.812
You’re not fooling me, Nic.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.549
You need to stop
your shady shit.

04:32.616 --> 04:35.520
You need to start
minding your own business.

04:35.587 --> 04:36.823
<i>Abuela,</i> look.

04:36.890 --> 04:39.729
Now you can watch all
your <i>telenovelas</i> in high def.

04:39.795 --> 04:42.935
Deaf? <i>Yo no estoy sorda.</i>

04:43.002 --> 04:45.238
I hear everything
in this house.

04:46.808 --> 04:51.618
Not everything.

04:51.685 --> 04:53.121
CECI:
Well, what do you think?

04:53.187 --> 04:55.157
( laughter )

04:55.224 --> 04:57.728
FILI:
<i>Ay, es una aparición.</i>

04:57.796 --> 05:00.068
<i>La Virgen de East Los High.</i>

05:00.135 --> 05:03.006
Ceci, say, "hell, no"
to the dress.

05:03.073 --> 05:04.575
What happened
to the other one?

05:04.642 --> 05:05.611
It was perfect.

05:05.678 --> 05:07.213
Pedro wanted
to see more options.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.719
FILI:
And less <i>tetas</i>
and face and arms--

05:09.786 --> 05:11.990
TIFFANY:
Hey, leave her alone.

05:12.057 --> 05:14.795
There’s nothing wrong with
wanting to make her man happy.

05:14.861 --> 05:16.297
Especially if he’s gonna
be supporting me

05:16.564 --> 05:18.769
when I’m out of a job.
You quitting on us?

05:18.836 --> 05:19.771
CECI:
I ain’t quitting shit.

05:19.838 --> 05:21.207
But if you hoes
lose at regionals,

05:21.275 --> 05:23.812
our competition season is
over and I lose my job.

05:23.878 --> 05:25.281
TIFFANY:
Don’t worry. We’ll win.

05:25.548 --> 05:26.783
FILI:
Yeah, with these moves,

05:26.851 --> 05:28.855
we’re going straight
to nationals.

05:28.922 --> 05:30.625

GINA: You gonna get me a car?
ROGELIO: Sure.

05:38.106 --> 05:40.277
What? Camila, guess what?

05:40.544 --> 05:42.982
Dad’s getting me a new car!
I didn’t say new.

05:43.049 --> 05:45.920
We can share it.
I don’t want anything from him.

05:50.764 --> 05:52.199
Sorry about that.

05:52.266 --> 05:55.805
Don’t be. I know
I wasn’t a good father.

05:56.907 --> 05:58.812
But I’m sober now.

05:58.879 --> 06:01.718
and I’m moving back to LA,

06:03.220 --> 06:05.724
I hope you guys
give me another chance.

06:08.128 --> 06:09.833
Well, I am.

06:14.707 --> 06:18.716
GINA:
Bye, dad.

06:19.284 --> 06:21.722
Miss you.

06:21.789 --> 06:24.226
How long you gonna be
at Jocelyn’s for?

06:24.293 --> 06:26.897
As long as you keep
bringing that jerk around.

06:27.966 --> 06:29.904
He’s our father.

06:29.971 --> 06:32.109
And why do you
hate him so much?

06:37.150 --> 06:40.190
Why don’t you ask
our father...

06:40.257 --> 06:42.728
what he did
to me for years?

06:42.796 --> 06:45.700
What? Hit you?

06:45.766 --> 06:47.804
’Cause let me tell you, I could
see why.

06:47.871 --> 06:51.645
No, he didn’t hit me.

06:52.982 --> 06:55.285
It was a lot worse than that.

06:56.387 --> 06:57.990
He’s sick.

06:58.056 --> 07:00.328
What are you saying?

07:06.773 --> 07:08.176
What do you think I’m saying?

07:10.414 --> 07:11.650
Oh, my god.

07:11.716 --> 07:13.187
You know,
you’re the one who’s sick,

07:13.252 --> 07:14.388
You know that?

Shit! Have you seen
our competition?

07:29.751 --> 07:31.821
Those Van Nuys <i>skonkas</i>
don’t play.

07:31.888 --> 07:33.691
Look at those moves.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.962
It’s okay.
We got this.

07:36.028 --> 07:37.331
Gina.
Hey.

07:37.397 --> 07:39.068
Can you cover
for me Friday night?

07:39.134 --> 07:42.408
Oh, sorry. I’m at UC Davis
with my dad this weekend.

07:42.675 --> 07:43.810
What about next week?

07:47.016 --> 07:48.953
JOCELYN:
Camila.

07:49.020 --> 07:50.156
I don’t wanna hear it.

07:50.223 --> 07:51.826
And you don’t wanna
deal with it either.

07:51.892 --> 07:53.762
Ay, chill, Doctor Drew.

07:53.829 --> 07:55.365
Listen, I found this group

07:55.432 --> 07:57.402
that has a hotline
for incest survivors.

07:57.670 --> 07:58.972
Shut-up!

07:59.039 --> 08:01.978
The only hotline I’m calling
is 1-800-I don’t give a shit.

’Sup.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.323
I got a surprise for you.

08:08.390 --> 08:10.028
Yo, where’s
my wedding invite?

08:10.094 --> 08:11.797
It’s in the mail!

08:11.864 --> 08:13.232

With no stamp on it.

08:15.837 --> 08:17.775
Yes. I can’t wait!
Thank you.

Ceci!

08:22.851 --> 08:25.021
Hey! Sunday, right?
Yeah!

08:25.088 --> 08:26.925
Hey, Maya’s getting back
from Santa Fe tomorrow,

08:26.992 --> 08:28.428
so you know we’re gonna
be ready to party.

08:28.695 --> 08:30.766
Well, if y’all are gonna
be busy, you don’t have to go.

08:30.833 --> 08:32.403
What are you talking about?
It’s your big day.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.938
I wouldn’t miss this
for the world.

08:34.005 --> 08:35.307
I know.
Where’s my invite?

08:35.374 --> 08:36.844
You know,
I forgot it at home.

08:36.911 --> 08:38.880
So, I’m going to drop it off
to you later, okay?

08:38.947 --> 08:39.882
I’ll see you later, chico.

What are you doing here?

08:53.909 --> 08:56.381
I came to pick up Gina,

08:56.447 --> 08:58.351
but I’d be happy
to give you a ride.

08:59.453 --> 09:01.290
To where?

09:01.358 --> 09:04.764
To get ice cream
like we used to?

09:04.830 --> 09:07.168
What are you talking about?

09:07.235 --> 09:10.909
Like you don’t remember.

09:10.976 --> 09:12.812
Tell Gina I’ll call her later.

09:12.879 --> 09:14.883
I ain’t telling her shit.

09:16.051 --> 09:17.954
You jealous, Camilita?

09:21.530 --> 09:25.002
If you touch her,
I’ll kill you.

Ooh, Camila.

09:38.126 --> 09:39.930
( music stops )

09:39.996 --> 09:42.335
Got a little something
for you.

09:42.402 --> 09:46.476
Why don’t you
slide into this

09:46.542 --> 09:48.880
and let me watch.

09:48.947 --> 09:51.419
Why don’t you slide in
and let me watch?

09:55.059 --> 09:57.162
I’m sorry, Nic.

09:57.230 --> 10:00.001
I’m just...
I’m just not feeling it.

10:00.068 --> 10:01.973
What’s going on? Huh?

10:02.039 --> 10:03.474
You’re not
into me anymore?

10:03.541 --> 10:06.113
No, no. That’s not it.
It’s just that...

10:06.180 --> 10:08.083
right now,
I’m not into anything.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.853
You sure there’s nobody else?
No.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.491
’Cause we haven’t
had sex in weeks.

10:12.558 --> 10:14.829
Why don’t you
wanna be with me?

10:17.902 --> 10:19.404
Hm?

10:19.471 --> 10:21.409
Camil-- Camila!

10:21.476 --> 10:23.479
Camila!

10:27.052 --> 10:28.956
Okay, so let’s take it
from the walk, yeah?

10:29.023 --> 10:31.562
Five, six, seven, walk.

10:31.829 --> 10:33.998
One, two, three, four,

10:34.066 --> 10:36.002
five, six, seven, eight.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.940
Samba, samba,
samba, samba.

10:38.006 --> 10:38.908
Roll.

10:38.975 --> 10:40.110
Hit, hit,
hit, hit.

10:40.177 --> 10:42.115
One, two, three-- Good!

10:42.182 --> 10:45.354
Five, six, seven, eight.

10:45.421 --> 10:47.357
Man, you guys
have come a long way.

10:47.424 --> 10:49.929
Thanks to you.
You’re the best coach ever.

10:49.996 --> 10:51.366
( girls agreeing )

10:51.433 --> 10:53.869
FILI:
That’s why we
got you something.

10:53.936 --> 10:55.940
You guys, I can’t
accept gifts from students.

10:56.007 --> 10:57.944
We’re not students,
we’re <i>familia.</i>

10:58.011 --> 10:59.982
And bridesmaids!

11:00.048 --> 11:01.385
Oh!

11:01.452 --> 11:02.886
C for Ceci.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.290
O and A for overachiever.

11:04.357 --> 11:07.128
And C-H for <i>chingona.</i>

11:08.097 --> 11:09.967
Thank you, you guys.

11:10.034 --> 11:12.005
And you guys
really are my family.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.309
( phone vibrates )

11:14.376 --> 11:16.412
Okay, just take it from
that last spot, okay?

11:16.479 --> 11:17.547
Hi, boo.

11:17.615 --> 11:19.118
PEDRO:
<i>Hey, you picking up the food?</i>

11:19.184 --> 11:21.122
Yeah, I’m leaving now.
<i>
No other errands?</i>

11:21.188 --> 11:22.591
No, I’m not stopping nowhere.

11:22.858 --> 11:24.260
<i>All right, I’ll meet you</i>
<i>at the taqueria.</i>

11:24.328 --> 11:26.064
Yes, I’ll be there
in thirty minutes.

11:26.131 --> 11:27.233
<i>You promise?</i>
Promise.

11:27.299 --> 11:29.103
<i>All right. Love you.</i>
Love you too.

11:29.170 --> 11:31.942
Dang, was that your fiance
or your parole officer?

11:32.009 --> 11:34.380
Pedro loves me. He’s just
a little protective.

11:34.447 --> 11:35.949
A little?

11:36.016 --> 11:37.485
Okay, girls, hurry up
because I gotta go.

11:37.552 --> 11:40.024
Okay?
So, five, six, seven eight.

11:40.091 --> 11:42.328
Just in time.
Your order just came up.

11:45.167 --> 11:46.502
What’s up, Ceci?

11:46.569 --> 11:51.245
Jacob, I wanted to invite you to
the wedding, but Pedro just...

11:51.312 --> 11:53.148
Something about, like,
we had too many people--

11:53.215 --> 11:56.354
Don’t even worry about it.

11:56.421 --> 11:59.027
Maya-- Maya, she
told me that we have to

11:59.094 --> 12:00.563
go to Rosarito for
the weekend, anyways,

12:00.629 --> 12:03.067
so, it’s cool. Don’t--
You know.

12:03.134 --> 12:05.071
Road trip?

12:05.138 --> 12:06.507
Well, sounds like fun.

12:06.574 --> 12:09.179
Yeah. Yeah. Um.

12:09.246 --> 12:12.017
I hope you have
a great wedding, though.

12:12.084 --> 12:13.220
Yeah, Pedro’s
going all out.

12:13.286 --> 12:15.090
He even got
pigeons and shit.

12:15.157 --> 12:17.361
Wow. Wish you all the best.

12:17.428 --> 12:20.400
PEDRO:
Thanks, bro.
That is really nice of you.

12:20.467 --> 12:22.972
<i>Mama,</i> they’re not pigeons,
they’re doves.

12:23.038 --> 12:26.645
Doves represent eternal love
because they mate for life.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.015
They’re forever.

12:30.253 --> 12:32.991
What’s up, man.
I’m Pedro.

12:33.057 --> 12:35.395
Yeah, we met before.
How you doing?

12:37.166 --> 12:38.968
How much do I owe you?

12:39.035 --> 12:42.174
Don’t worry about it.
It’s a wedding gift.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.145
Sure, bro.
Here’s your tip, then.

12:44.212 --> 12:45.347
Babe, you wanna get that?

12:50.123 --> 12:51.258
Come here.
I missed you.

13:00.175 --> 13:03.048
CECI:
And one, two, three, four,

13:03.114 --> 13:05.252
five, six, seven, eight.

13:05.319 --> 13:07.256
One, two, three,

13:07.323 --> 13:09.326
four, five, six--

13:09.393 --> 13:11.430
Hey, what the hell
is wrong with you guys?

13:11.496 --> 13:13.367
Regionals is tomorrow,
ladies.

13:13.434 --> 13:15.238
That’s <i>mañana</i>
for you <i>chunti</i> bitches!

13:15.304 --> 13:17.107
I think we need
to rehearse tonight.

13:17.175 --> 13:19.245
No shit.
But school’s closed.

13:19.311 --> 13:21.716
Hey, my cousin
runs a Zumba studio,

13:21.983 --> 13:24.054
and maybe we
can rehearse in there.

13:24.121 --> 13:25.490
Good. ’Cause you guys suck.

13:25.557 --> 13:28.128
Find it. Do it again.
Hurry up.

13:28.195 --> 13:30.199
Five, six, seven, eight.

13:30.266 --> 13:32.971
One, two, three, four.

13:33.038 --> 13:35.342
CAMILA:
Man, you should have seen it.

13:35.409 --> 13:38.682
It felt so good
to tell Rogelio off.

13:38.749 --> 13:40.585
I’m so proud of you.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.226
Tonight, let’s just go out
and have some fun, okay?

13:44.293 --> 13:46.062
Mm, y’all do it, huh?

13:46.129 --> 13:47.298
So you can hang out
with Jocelyn,

13:47.365 --> 13:48.601
but you can’t hang out with me?

13:48.668 --> 13:50.370
We’re going to
a bachelorette party.

13:50.437 --> 13:52.106
Yeah. Girls’ night out.
No guys allowed.

13:52.173 --> 13:53.543
Yeah, but you’re gonna
need a stripper.

13:53.610 --> 13:55.380
And Slick Nic’s
got some moves.

13:55.447 --> 13:57.551
Shake it!
Yeah!

13:57.618 --> 13:58.987
( phone beeps )

14:00.489 --> 14:02.626
Shit.
Hey, I gotta go.

14:02.693 --> 14:05.533
I’ll be back.
Hey, hold up.

14:05.599 --> 14:08.538
Hey, come on. What’s really
going on in that studio?

14:08.605 --> 14:11.210
Studio? I’m going to Vegas.

14:11.277 --> 14:12.411
You need me
to come with you?

14:12.478 --> 14:13.781
No, no.
I’ll be back tomorrow.

14:14.048 --> 14:15.785
Have fun with Jocelyn,
all right?

14:26.271 --> 14:28.309
CECI:
I’ll pick up Isela on my way
back from practice.

14:28.376 --> 14:29.511
I’ll be home by ten.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.215
Okay. Well,
have a good rehearsal.

14:31.281 --> 14:32.216
Thank you.
I love you.

14:32.282 --> 14:34.521
I love you, too.
Don’t forget that.

14:34.588 --> 14:35.790
Come here.

14:39.196 --> 14:40.298
Bye.
Bye.

14:49.682 --> 14:53.121

16:52.714 --> 16:56.890
Let me guess. Those sweaty guys
made you wanna throw up?

16:57.157 --> 16:59.295
No. I just had to pee.

16:59.361 --> 17:01.331
Um hmm.

17:02.466 --> 17:04.804
Guess you’re not
buying that.

17:04.872 --> 17:08.513
Yeah. I think I remember
what you like.

17:08.579 --> 17:10.717
Is that right?

17:10.783 --> 17:13.621
What else
do you remember?

17:16.193 --> 17:19.199
That we had fun.

17:19.266 --> 17:21.669
I haven’t had fun like this
in a while.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.578
Thanks for making me
come out.

17:26.447 --> 17:28.249
News flash.

17:28.316 --> 17:30.821
You still haven’t come out.

17:30.887 --> 17:32.223
( giggles )

17:32.290 --> 17:35.229
But I’m waiting.

17:40.506 --> 17:41.807
I’m taking off.

17:41.874 --> 17:43.578
Hold up.
Let me come with you.

17:43.644 --> 17:46.885
You? Leave a party

17:46.952 --> 17:48.354
I know! What?
What?

17:48.421 --> 17:50.425
( both giggle )

17:50.492 --> 17:55.266
Hurry up! The guys are about
to show their dingalings.

17:56.504 --> 17:57.606
You sure you’ve seen
enough?

17:57.672 --> 17:59.342
Yeah.
More than enough.

Been thinking, maybe,

18:39.551 --> 18:40.686
you know, Northridge
is really close.

18:40.752 --> 18:42.756
Maybe we don’t have
to go to UC Davis.

18:42.823 --> 18:44.794
Uh, well,
it’s up to you.

18:44.861 --> 18:47.433
But I was really
looking forward

18:47.500 --> 18:49.370
to spending
some time together.

18:50.571 --> 18:51.807
Yeah, okay.
We can go.

18:51.874 --> 18:53.009
Friday?

18:53.276 --> 18:54.411
Yeah.
Yeah?

18:54.478 --> 18:55.748
( laughs )
Sure.

18:57.752 --> 18:59.589
LORENA:
Is that you, Gina?

18:59.656 --> 19:00.957
I’ll see you Friday.

19:01.024 --> 19:02.360
Friday.
Okay.

19:02.427 --> 19:03.530
Good-night.
Bye.

19:12.012 --> 19:13.347

19:35.022 --> 19:36.024
Man.

19:36.292 --> 19:38.630
Hey, thanks for letting me
stick around.

19:38.697 --> 19:39.832
Stay as long as you want.

19:39.899 --> 19:41.434
Tell that
to your <i>abuelo.</i>

19:41.501 --> 19:42.971
He asked me for rent
yesterday.

19:45.308 --> 19:47.981
Maybe there’s another way
you can make rent.

19:50.485 --> 19:52.655
I don’t scrub toilets.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.771
That’s not
what I was thinking.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.050
( door opening )

20:07.318 --> 20:09.789
Hey, baby.
Hey.

20:09.856 --> 20:13.495
( man speaking indistinctly
on TV )

20:13.561 --> 20:14.897
CECI:
I’m gonna put Isela up.

20:19.073 --> 20:21.410
Okay.

20:22.913 --> 20:25.484
( <i>dramatic music playing</i> )

20:25.551 --> 20:28.692
Why do you always
put up with all my drama?

20:31.662 --> 20:33.566
You know why.

21:11.805 --> 21:13.909
( car door slams )

21:27.904 --> 21:29.806
PEDRO:
So how was rehearsal?
Did you have fun?

21:29.873 --> 21:31.509
Yeah, it was good.
The girls did a good job.

21:31.576 --> 21:32.878
What are you watching?

21:34.649 --> 21:36.886
I saw you, Ceci.

21:38.991 --> 21:41.128
The girls threw me
a surprise bachelorette--

21:41.195 --> 21:42.564
Shut up!

21:42.630 --> 21:45.068
( soft moaning )

21:52.148 --> 21:54.152
NICOLAS: ... this, Camil--
( girl gasps )

21:57.626 --> 21:59.596
CAMILA:
Nic!

21:59.662 --> 22:01.900
( whispering )
Oh, my God.

22:01.967 --> 22:04.672
( Ceci screams )
You stupid bitch!

22:04.739 --> 22:06.008
Is that what you think,
whore?

22:06.075 --> 22:07.880
CECI: Isela, go back to sleep!
Go to bed!

22:07.946 --> 22:10.817
You stupid bitch!
Get up.

22:10.884 --> 22:12.687
Where are you going?

22:12.754 --> 22:14.190
After everything
I’ve done for you.

22:14.457 --> 22:16.588
You’re gonna
go whoring around?

22:16.655 --> 22:18.193
( Isela starts crying )

22:18.460 --> 22:20.654
Nobody’s gonna take care of you
the way I do. Nobody.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.789
Do you understand?
Look at me!

22:22.856 --> 22:24.902
You will never have it
as good as you have it with me,

22:24.968 --> 22:28.071
do you understand me?
You’re pathetic.

22:28.138 --> 22:31.074
Stupid bitch.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.710
Come at me again, I swear
to God I will kill you.

22:33.777 --> 22:35.979
You’re not gonna do shit,
you little slut.

22:36.046 --> 22:37.514
Nothing.

22:37.581 --> 22:40.484
( dramatic music playing )
