00:19.191 --> 00:21.711
[light, playful music]

00:23.264 --> 00:24.645
[woman] Of course.

00:24.679 --> 00:26.716
I'm gonna take the documents
with me to my house.

00:26.750 --> 00:27.579
I know.

00:32.101 --> 00:34.206
[man] You don't understand how
important this is for me.

00:34.241 --> 00:35.966
Just text me the address.

00:36.001 --> 00:37.692
I'll be there as
fast as Superman.

00:40.592 --> 00:44.216
[woman] Yes, I'll read them and
study them during the weekend.

00:44.251 --> 00:46.598
On Monday, I'll call
you to discuss them.

00:46.632 --> 00:49.049
I know how important this
case is for the firm.

00:51.706 --> 00:52.949
[man] Yeah, I'll be there soon.

00:52.983 --> 00:55.158
I have a surprise for
you. You'll love it.

00:55.193 --> 00:56.642
Gotta go, bye.

00:56.677 --> 00:59.128
[light, playful music continues]

[muffled music playing]

01:58.289 --> 02:00.120
Wait, she said yes.

02:00.154 --> 02:02.605
Of course. Why wouldn't
she wanna date a doctor?

02:03.157 --> 02:05.884
You know, that's when
relationships never last.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.506
Rocio!

02:07.541 --> 02:08.887
Why are you so late?

02:10.026 --> 02:12.960
Oh, there was so much traffic.

02:12.994 --> 02:15.411
There was like 100 accidents.

02:16.550 --> 02:18.034
You look like you need a drink.

02:18.897 --> 02:20.001
Let me know how it is.

02:20.899 --> 02:23.522
[upbeat music]

02:23.557 --> 02:24.799
-Delicious.
-Yeah.

02:26.111 --> 02:27.768
All right, well, I gotta
go make some drinks.

02:27.802 --> 02:29.666
But you, you keep drinking,

02:29.701 --> 02:33.256
because tonight we
celebrate! [laughs]

02:33.291 --> 02:34.223
What are we celebrating?

02:34.257 --> 02:35.603
I just graduated med school.

02:35.638 --> 02:37.743
Thanks again for
lending me your patio.

02:37.778 --> 02:39.055
He met another girl today.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.298
And he's a doctor now?

02:40.332 --> 02:41.161
Mm-hm.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.369
Oh my God.

02:42.403 --> 02:43.887
But I do need to vent
about my mother-in-law.

02:43.922 --> 02:46.442
Oh, you always need to vent
about your mother-in-law.

02:46.476 --> 02:50.308
Sacramento is the worst
place for a honeymoon.

02:50.341 --> 02:51.930
But Steven said yes?

02:51.964 --> 02:53.828
Of course he said yes.
He's a mama's boy.

02:53.863 --> 02:55.140
He'll do whatever she says.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.522
But you don't need
to agree, do you?

02:57.555 --> 02:58.799
I know.

02:58.833 --> 03:00.352
But that's where she
had her honeymoon,

03:00.387 --> 03:02.734
and she really wants it, and
she's paying for everything.

03:03.286 --> 03:04.563
So...

03:04.598 --> 03:07.256
No, no, no, if it was
me, I wouldn't care.

03:07.290 --> 03:08.947
Yeah, well, when you
live with someone,

03:08.981 --> 03:11.225
you have to compromise, a lot.

03:11.260 --> 03:13.020
Otherwise, it's
not gonna work out.

03:13.054 --> 03:13.883
[sighs]

03:13.917 --> 03:15.988
And I don't wanna end up alone.

03:16.023 --> 03:18.853
And I wanna have
kids, at least five.

03:20.510 --> 03:22.132
I just wanna have the
life that I dreamed of

03:22.167 --> 03:23.444
when I was five years old.

03:26.551 --> 03:28.173
Are you listening to me?

03:28.208 --> 03:29.036
Rocio?

03:30.762 --> 03:34.283
Yes, yes. Sorry, I just
got a little distracted.

03:34.317 --> 03:37.043
But yeah, I am so happy for you.

03:37.078 --> 03:38.252
Alright, enough about me.

03:39.357 --> 03:40.254
What about you?

03:40.289 --> 03:41.255
I know you've been dating.

03:41.290 --> 03:44.016
Ugh, that's a nightmare.

03:44.051 --> 03:46.156
I'm just so tired
of having bad dates.

03:47.572 --> 03:51.576
It's like every single guy in
this city is a narcissistic,

03:51.610 --> 03:56.097
superficial, egocentrical guy.

03:56.132 --> 03:57.616
It's so frustrating.

03:57.651 --> 04:01.206
And when you feel like you
finally find a good one,

04:01.241 --> 04:05.348
well, those are the worst,
because they lie to your face.

04:05.383 --> 04:07.108
You can't trust anyone.

04:11.527 --> 04:12.355
Who's that guy?

04:13.460 --> 04:16.394
Oh, I don't know, probably
one of Justin's geek friends.

04:18.430 --> 04:20.880
[soft music]

04:22.745 --> 04:23.918
What?

04:23.953 --> 04:25.161
You look like an idiot.

04:25.195 --> 04:28.613
I got it, I got it,
I freaking got it.

04:28.647 --> 04:29.890
-No!
-Oh yes.

04:29.924 --> 04:31.201
Yo, did you get the pages?

04:31.236 --> 04:33.825
The Owners, Issue Number One.

04:33.859 --> 04:35.620
What the fuck, how?

04:35.654 --> 04:38.036
A friend of a friend of
a friend, of a friend.

04:38.070 --> 04:38.864
[laughing]

04:38.899 --> 04:40.314
Lucky bastard.

04:40.349 --> 04:43.248
Come on, let's go introduce
you to some ladies, huh?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.802
You, my friend, deserve it.

04:45.837 --> 04:48.736
Positive energy attracts
positive thoughts.

04:48.771 --> 04:51.912
And positive thoughts make
your heart's desires come true.

04:51.946 --> 04:53.810
Stop reciting Kaon, okay.

04:53.845 --> 04:55.709
You just got lucky.

04:55.743 --> 04:57.227
Oh, you know that
girl I asked out?

04:57.262 --> 04:58.159
Yeah.

04:58.194 --> 04:58.953
We're going out tomorrow.

04:58.988 --> 04:59.782
Really?

04:59.816 --> 05:01.024
Yeah.

05:01.059 --> 05:02.129
[laughs] You're
gonna get caught.

05:02.163 --> 05:03.233
Dude, stop lying.

05:03.268 --> 05:04.718
Eh, we're young and wild.

05:04.752 --> 05:06.720
And stupid. I mean
you are, I'm not.

05:08.066 --> 05:11.759
Ladies, allow me to
introduce you to Giancarlo.

05:11.794 --> 05:14.555
Rocio, Giancarlo.
Natalie, Giancarlo.

05:14.590 --> 05:16.177
Hi.

05:16.212 --> 05:17.040
Nice to meet you.

05:19.491 --> 05:20.354
Hi.

05:20.389 --> 05:22.218
Hi, nice to meet you.

05:25.290 --> 05:26.464
[Rocio] Nice shirt.

05:26.498 --> 05:28.224
Oh, thanks.

05:28.258 --> 05:29.156
Cool colors.

05:32.815 --> 05:34.748
Okay, let's go,
Giancarlo. Two more.

05:36.370 --> 05:39.200
Okay, so I'm definitely
gonna rewrite them.

05:39.235 --> 05:40.616
Been going on for
the last two months.

05:40.650 --> 05:41.893
Hi.

05:41.927 --> 05:44.413
[light music]

05:45.379 --> 05:46.691
Your panties are showing.

05:47.761 --> 05:48.658
What?

05:48.693 --> 05:52.524
[whispering in foreign language]

05:54.630 --> 05:56.494
I'm sorry, but I needed
to say something.

05:56.528 --> 05:58.358
I don't know why no
one has said anything.

06:00.187 --> 06:01.015
Asshole.

06:03.501 --> 06:06.366
[soft piano music]

06:11.060 --> 06:13.890
[phone vibrating]

06:20.587 --> 06:21.484
Hello.

06:21.519 --> 06:22.727
[Giancarlo on phone] Hi, Rocio?

06:23.659 --> 06:25.143
Yes.

06:25.177 --> 06:28.871
It's Giancarlo. I met you
at Justin's party last week.

06:30.976 --> 06:33.220
He gave me your
cellphone number.

06:35.222 --> 06:38.398
Of course, how can I forget you?

06:38.432 --> 06:41.055
Yeah, I, I feel bad

06:41.090 --> 06:42.919
and I wanted to apologize.

06:45.474 --> 06:46.647
What are you doing now?

06:47.752 --> 06:49.788
What do you mean?

06:49.823 --> 06:50.720
Can I pick you up?

06:50.755 --> 06:52.515
No, I have a date.

06:53.827 --> 06:54.931
With who?

06:54.966 --> 06:56.519
That's none of your business.

06:58.176 --> 07:02.939
It's four PM, so it's probably
the first date with him.

07:02.974 --> 07:05.217
What's wrong with you?

07:05.252 --> 07:07.668
I told you, that's
none of your business.

07:07.703 --> 07:08.600
Sorry.

07:08.635 --> 07:09.843
Stop saying that you're sorry.

07:09.877 --> 07:12.190
I don't think you're
actually being honest.

07:12.224 --> 07:15.849
Yeah, I'm not, because I'm
not saying anything wrong.

07:17.022 --> 07:18.299
I mean, it's what
people like to hear.

07:18.334 --> 07:20.474
A fake apology?

07:20.509 --> 07:22.131
You want me to be honest?

07:22.165 --> 07:23.650
Yeah.

07:23.684 --> 07:27.136
I mean you were very honest
telling me that I had a hole

07:27.170 --> 07:29.794
in my pants and that my
panties were very bright.

07:29.828 --> 07:31.485
Because they were bright red.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.555
Whatever.

07:32.590 --> 07:34.419
Look, Giancarlo, it
was nice to meet you,

07:34.454 --> 07:36.076
but I actually need to go.

07:36.110 --> 07:38.216
No, no, no, just
wait, just wait.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.874
You just told me to be honest.

07:40.908 --> 07:43.635
Okay, can I ask you a question?

07:43.670 --> 07:45.188
Okay, go ahead.

07:45.223 --> 07:48.709
The date that you're going
on, is it your first date?

07:48.744 --> 07:49.676
Yes.

07:49.710 --> 07:50.780
Do you like the guy?

07:50.815 --> 07:52.851
Basically, yes, he's attractive,

07:52.886 --> 07:54.266
but as a person, I don't know.

07:54.301 --> 07:55.578
That's why I'm going
out on a date with him.

07:55.613 --> 07:57.477
Do you really wanna
go on this date?

07:57.511 --> 07:58.719
No.

07:58.754 --> 08:01.653
In a perfect world, what
do you really wanna do?

08:01.688 --> 08:03.413
Like right now.

08:03.448 --> 08:06.313
Mm, I don't know.

08:06.347 --> 08:08.246
What are you now, a reporter?

08:08.280 --> 08:10.490
Just bear with me, please.

08:12.871 --> 08:14.977
[scoffs] I don't know if you're
trying to manipulate me

08:15.011 --> 08:16.634
or if you're just crazy.

08:16.668 --> 08:21.052
So it was nice talking to
you, Giancarlo, okay, bye.

08:25.159 --> 08:27.990
[traffic passing]

08:43.695 --> 08:47.872
[speaking foreign
language on TV]

09:15.140 --> 09:17.315
[sighing]

09:19.800 --> 09:21.837
What do I really want?

09:21.871 --> 09:24.460
[gentle music]

09:35.298 --> 09:37.956
[phone dialing]

09:42.478 --> 09:45.032
[phone ringing]

09:45.067 --> 09:46.758
Hey, it's me.

09:53.178 --> 09:54.732
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:56.043 --> 09:57.597
I was not expecting the call.

09:58.770 --> 10:01.428
Well, I been thinking a
lot about what you say.

10:01.462 --> 10:04.707
When you asked,
what do I wanna do?

10:04.742 --> 10:08.297
And what I wanna do
is have a nice walk

10:08.331 --> 10:09.781
and a good conversation.

10:10.989 --> 10:12.646
So, hope you don't
disappoint me.

10:14.544 --> 10:15.476
Ouch.

10:17.340 --> 10:20.930
So, the date wasn't
that great, huh?

10:20.965 --> 10:24.175
It was fine, I guess.
He was a nice guy.

10:25.555 --> 10:27.281
Do you date a lot?

10:27.316 --> 10:29.214
Mm, not much.

10:29.249 --> 10:30.457
I'm always busy.

10:31.561 --> 10:32.390
Working?

10:33.702 --> 10:34.530
Yeah.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.808
What do you do?

10:38.845 --> 10:41.261
I am a lawyer, a
business lawyer.

10:41.295 --> 10:44.574
Ooh, that sounds busy.

10:44.609 --> 10:46.438
Yes, it can get a little hectic.

10:47.923 --> 10:49.131
What do you do?

10:50.339 --> 10:52.444
What do I do, or
if I date or not?

10:54.067 --> 10:54.861
-Both.
-[laughs]

10:56.483 --> 10:58.727
I'm an app developer.

10:58.761 --> 11:02.247
I have my own company, and no,

11:02.282 --> 11:04.215
I don't date that much anymore.

11:05.354 --> 11:06.079
Hm.

11:07.149 --> 11:09.392
And what type of apps do you do?

11:09.427 --> 11:12.119
I'm actually developing
a very cool one.

11:12.154 --> 11:13.327
But this one, I'm
doing it for myself,

11:13.362 --> 11:15.882
not for any company,
I do freelance.

11:15.916 --> 11:18.263
I call it Mentira.

11:18.298 --> 11:21.232
It's kind of a lie detector
for your cellphone.

11:21.266 --> 11:24.925
It detects your voice,
like the steadiness of it,

11:24.960 --> 11:27.238
and then decides if you're
telling the truth or not.

11:27.272 --> 11:29.171
Hm, sounds interesting.

11:29.205 --> 11:31.069
But how does it work?

11:31.104 --> 11:33.796
It just speaks
through the speakers,

11:33.831 --> 11:37.110
the cellphone speakers,
and then it would say

11:37.144 --> 11:38.905
like "lie" or "true."

11:43.219 --> 11:46.947
So, why don't you date
that much anymore?

11:48.431 --> 11:52.712
It's not that I don't date
or I don't like to date.

11:52.746 --> 11:56.060
It just doesn't
interest me as much.

11:56.094 --> 11:58.994
Like the other older I
get, the more I realize

11:59.028 --> 12:02.480
that I waste more time
dating than not dating.

12:04.793 --> 12:06.518
Hm, what do you mean?

12:07.830 --> 12:09.867
If I date because
I need to date,

12:09.901 --> 12:12.766
I feel like I wasted
my time and money.

12:14.216 --> 12:17.978
If I'm not doing it, I do a
lot of things that I love.

12:18.013 --> 12:21.879
And the older I get, the
more the things that I love

12:21.913 --> 12:23.259
that I wanna do.

12:24.467 --> 12:28.092
Okay, but what if
time keeps passing

12:28.126 --> 12:30.025
and you don't find
your soulmate?

12:30.059 --> 12:31.785
You're gonna end up alone.

12:31.820 --> 12:32.752
No.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.823
You know what, that
would be fantastic.

12:34.857 --> 12:35.685
What?

12:35.720 --> 12:37.066
Because it means
I did what I love

12:37.101 --> 12:37.964
with the time that I had.

12:39.103 --> 12:43.866
You know, in time, I love to be

12:43.901 --> 12:46.662
in an empty room, I
love the quietness

12:46.696 --> 12:48.491
and the solitude of a space.

12:49.389 --> 12:50.528
It gives me peace.

12:51.391 --> 12:53.255
You say that.

12:53.289 --> 12:56.189
But the reality is that
nobody wants to be alone.

12:56.223 --> 12:57.431
Nobody wants to be.

12:59.399 --> 13:00.607
That's why you're here.

13:01.850 --> 13:04.438
No, I'm here because
I wanna be here,

13:04.473 --> 13:06.130
not because I don't
wanna be alone.

13:08.442 --> 13:12.584
I, I learned over time
to be honest with myself,

13:12.619 --> 13:17.279
in everything I do, with time,
love, life, work, everything.

13:20.247 --> 13:22.663
Well, good for you.

13:24.079 --> 13:25.735
That sounds depressing.

13:26.633 --> 13:28.255
Really, what's depressing?

13:28.290 --> 13:30.568
Wanting to be alone on purpose.

13:31.638 --> 13:33.709
Okay, Miss Relationship Expert,

13:33.743 --> 13:35.918
so how's that working for you?

13:35.953 --> 13:40.785
Well, not great, but at
least I'm trying, you know?

13:40.820 --> 13:44.375
And, one day I'll find true love

13:44.409 --> 13:48.137
and a great husband, and
I'll have beautiful kids.

13:51.658 --> 13:53.280
That sounds good, and

13:54.868 --> 13:56.974
that's depressing.

13:58.078 --> 14:00.391
Wait, why is that depressing?

14:00.425 --> 14:03.118
Because it looks like your
whole idea of happiness

14:03.152 --> 14:04.602
is based on an
event that you have

14:04.636 --> 14:07.018
not accomplished just yet.

14:07.053 --> 14:10.021
It means that right
now, at this instant,

14:10.056 --> 14:11.885
your life is not fulfilled.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.957
Okay, what would happen if
you never find your husband

14:14.992 --> 14:19.410
or if you would never get
married or can have kids?

14:20.618 --> 14:22.240
What exactly are
you doing right now?

14:22.275 --> 14:23.655
Not being completely happy?

14:25.588 --> 14:27.521
I'm happy. Okay, I am.

14:27.556 --> 14:28.902
I'm great, actually.

14:28.937 --> 14:31.940
I have a great
job, and I, and I,

14:31.974 --> 14:34.080
am saving to buy a house,
and my mom's healthy

14:34.114 --> 14:36.668
and I am healthy, so yes,
I'm happy, thank you.

14:38.049 --> 14:40.500
[soft music]

14:43.089 --> 14:45.229
We can change topics
if you want to.

14:46.092 --> 14:47.921
Yes, let's do that.

14:47.956 --> 14:49.992
Did you fix your pants?

14:50.027 --> 14:52.926
Yes, I did. I stapled them.

14:54.445 --> 14:55.895
What do you mean
you stapled them?

14:55.929 --> 14:58.898
I stapled the freaking hole
so my bright red panties

14:58.932 --> 15:00.934
wouldn't shine on
everyone's faces.

15:02.453 --> 15:05.352
-[laughing]
-Yes, I did.

15:05.387 --> 15:07.596
[laughing]

15:11.876 --> 15:13.740
Thank you for the walk.

15:13.774 --> 15:16.467
It was, interesting.

15:17.502 --> 15:19.573
Thank you for calling me.

15:23.025 --> 15:25.959
Have a good night,
okay? Drive safe.

15:25.994 --> 15:26.995
Okay.

15:27.029 --> 15:27.892
Night.

15:28.755 --> 15:30.067
I'll...I'll...

15:31.206 --> 15:32.069
see you around?

15:33.829 --> 15:34.657
Yeah.

15:36.280 --> 15:41.285
Bye.

15:41.906 --> 15:44.046
[soft music]

15:50.777 --> 15:52.641
Rocio, Rocio, wait, wait.

15:53.538 --> 15:55.506
What happened?

15:55.540 --> 15:59.096
What are you gonna
do next Saturday?

15:59.130 --> 15:59.959
Wait.

16:01.167 --> 16:03.686
What happened with "Mr.
I Don't Like to Date"?

16:03.721 --> 16:05.274
What I said was that I
don't like it date

16:05.309 --> 16:09.071
because of the heck of dating
or because I wanna be alone,

16:09.106 --> 16:12.488
or because I wanna score,
if you know what I mean.

16:14.145 --> 16:14.974
No thanks.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.906
Wait, what? No, what?

16:16.941 --> 16:19.288
No, I don't wanna date with you?

16:19.323 --> 16:22.843
But I wanna date you.
I wanna know you.

16:22.878 --> 16:23.983
It's a choice.

16:25.467 --> 16:27.710
What do you really want?

16:27.745 --> 16:30.334
[gentle music]

16:34.407 --> 16:35.339
Okay, fine.

16:38.411 --> 16:39.826
Really?

16:39.860 --> 16:42.553
Yes. Why, am I making
a bad choice here?

16:42.587 --> 16:44.210
No no, no no, you're
making a great decision.

16:44.244 --> 16:46.419
You're good. Thank you.

16:46.453 --> 16:47.351
For what?

16:47.385 --> 16:48.421
For saying yes.

16:49.870 --> 16:52.045
Oh my God, please stop.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.909
Okay, I'll call you.

16:53.943 --> 16:54.841
Okay.

16:54.875 --> 16:55.704
Okay.

16:57.050 --> 16:57.844
Bye.

16:57.878 --> 17:00.467
[gentle music]

17:26.804 --> 17:29.703
[knocking on door]

17:32.189 --> 17:34.122
You don't need to staple
your pants anymore.

17:34.156 --> 17:35.537
What?

17:35.571 --> 17:38.954
First of all, it's
just a pair of pants.

17:38.988 --> 17:41.336
And second of all,
who the hell uses

17:41.370 --> 17:43.476
a freaking sewing
machine nowadays?

17:43.510 --> 17:45.581
You never know. It
can come in handy.

17:45.616 --> 17:46.962
Do you know how to use one?

17:46.996 --> 17:47.825
No.

17:49.861 --> 17:50.793
Okay, thanks.

17:50.828 --> 17:52.726
I thought it was a nice gesture.

17:52.761 --> 17:54.176
Nope, it wasn't.

17:55.971 --> 17:58.560
[gentle music]

18:05.843 --> 18:06.913
What is that?

18:06.947 --> 18:10.261
Oh, that's, uh, sorry.

18:13.057 --> 18:13.885
It's fine.

18:15.024 --> 18:19.167
That's the symbol of
Kaon. He's a superhero.

18:19.201 --> 18:22.308
I love superhero
movies and comic books.

18:22.342 --> 18:25.242
Are you one of those guys
that goes to those conventions

18:25.276 --> 18:29.418
and dresses up like superheroes?

18:30.833 --> 18:32.973
Yes, I love those conventions.

18:33.008 --> 18:36.770
And no, I don't dress
up. Too much work.

18:36.805 --> 18:38.634
I'll never understand why people

18:38.669 --> 18:41.050
like that so much, you know?

18:41.085 --> 18:44.157
I don't know. I just
grew up with them.

18:44.192 --> 18:46.228
Making me believe that
I could accomplish

18:47.229 --> 18:48.403
anything that I wanted.

18:50.025 --> 18:51.130
This sounds weird, but

18:52.510 --> 18:55.617
if you apply what I call
the superhero philosophy

18:55.651 --> 18:59.103
into your own life, like
you put positive thoughts

18:59.138 --> 19:02.417
into your head and
you act on them,

19:03.556 --> 19:04.902
you can make things
happen for you.

19:04.936 --> 19:07.732
Like, good things.

19:07.767 --> 19:08.940
Like flying?

19:08.975 --> 19:11.495
[laughing]

19:11.529 --> 19:12.358
No.

19:13.221 --> 19:15.361
Like hope.

19:17.052 --> 19:18.329
You know Superman, yeah?

19:19.951 --> 19:21.125
Yes.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.853
The S on Superman's
costume represents hope,

19:24.887 --> 19:27.304
and looking at that
fictional symbol,

19:27.338 --> 19:30.307
it remind you of
a positive word,

19:30.341 --> 19:32.585
like a powerful feeling.

19:33.793 --> 19:35.864
And I think we need a
lot of that nowadays.

19:39.523 --> 19:41.283
Where are we going?

19:41.318 --> 19:44.113
If you don't mind, I
need to go back home.

19:44.148 --> 19:45.529
I left my wallet there.

19:45.563 --> 19:48.221
Oh don't worry. I can
totally pay for both of us.

19:48.256 --> 19:51.949
Oh no, no, I invited you,
and I wanna treat you.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.226
And it's not a male thing.

19:53.261 --> 19:55.918
I just wanna treat you.

20:00.958 --> 20:04.306
Welcome to my
superhero art gallery.

20:04.341 --> 20:06.964
[gentle music]

20:12.314 --> 20:13.281
I like this one.

20:18.734 --> 20:23.739
I like the colors and the
details of the anatomy.

20:26.155 --> 20:29.435
It's by a famous
comic book artist.

20:29.469 --> 20:31.091
I have lot of his stuff.

20:36.131 --> 20:37.028
Very impressive.

20:41.964 --> 20:42.931
What's that?

20:44.381 --> 20:46.900
Oh, I was doing exercise.

20:46.935 --> 20:48.385
With a regular rope?

20:48.419 --> 20:51.284
Yeah, you can do a lot
of stuff with a big rope.

20:54.701 --> 20:57.359
Did you find that
wallet? I'm kinda hungry.

20:57.394 --> 20:59.327
Okay, just one second.

21:03.054 --> 21:06.575
Do you know, the one
you like, that's Kaon?

21:07.714 --> 21:10.579
He's a Latino superhero.
He's very powerful.

21:11.822 --> 21:14.203
Do you wanna hear Kaon's oath?

21:14.238 --> 21:15.446
I guess.

21:15.481 --> 21:17.483
Okay, all right.

21:21.487 --> 21:24.559
The power within you
is the power within me.

21:24.593 --> 21:26.354
It's the power of the universe.

21:26.388 --> 21:28.045
It's the power of us all.

21:33.222 --> 21:34.051
Wallet.

21:35.224 --> 21:36.398
Yeah.

21:36.433 --> 21:40.057
I just, I just love
this stuff a lot.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.472
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

21:47.616 --> 21:48.893
Rocio, I found it.

21:48.928 --> 21:49.825
You wanna come out?

21:52.414 --> 21:54.899
Welcome to Giancarlo's
Casa Restaurant.

21:57.557 --> 22:00.111
Come on in. I know
the lady's hungry.

22:03.425 --> 22:08.085
Wow, I was not
expecting this at all.

22:08.119 --> 22:12.261
For someone that
doesn't like to date,

22:12.296 --> 22:14.091
this is very thoughtful.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.613
Well, I'm a romantic gentleman,

22:18.647 --> 22:21.685
and I love a moment like this.

22:24.446 --> 22:25.309
Menu?

22:28.174 --> 22:29.002
I'll be back.

22:29.693 --> 22:31.004
Okay.

22:31.039 --> 22:33.524
[light music]

22:48.090 --> 22:50.230
I can tell that you
saw the menu already.

22:51.404 --> 22:52.957
Yeah, I love it.

22:55.028 --> 22:56.789
You know why people love food?

22:57.790 --> 22:59.205
Why?

22:59.239 --> 23:03.830
Because it's diverse. Diversity
makes everything better.

23:05.798 --> 23:06.626
Love it.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.079
So,

23:14.220 --> 23:15.359
did you like my menus?

23:15.394 --> 23:19.398
Yeah, they seem very creative.

23:19.432 --> 23:21.158
I just did it to impress you.

23:23.540 --> 23:24.403
Salut.

23:26.163 --> 23:28.199
[glasses clinking]

23:28.234 --> 23:29.442
Thank you.

23:29.477 --> 23:31.996
[light music]

23:37.346 --> 23:40.004
[phone pinging]

23:42.421 --> 23:43.629
Thank you.

23:43.663 --> 23:44.561
You're welcome.

23:45.631 --> 23:48.323
[phone pinging]

23:49.462 --> 23:50.739
Sorry that I'm texting.

23:50.774 --> 23:53.052
It's my mom, but I'm done.

23:53.086 --> 23:53.915
It's okay.

23:59.955 --> 24:01.336
What?

24:01.370 --> 24:02.889
You're too young to be a lawyer.

24:02.924 --> 24:05.789
Well, I didn't take any breaks

24:05.823 --> 24:09.033
between high school,
college and law school, so.

24:10.172 --> 24:13.486
I love what I do,
and I do what I love.

24:13.521 --> 24:15.833
Nice, good for you.

24:15.868 --> 24:18.836
Ever since I was a little
girl, my mom raised me

24:18.871 --> 24:22.391
to be, you know,
independent, to study,

24:22.426 --> 24:25.464
to do something for my
own, be my own boss.

24:26.913 --> 24:31.435
And, I mean I'm working at
this law firm right now,

24:31.470 --> 24:34.921
and I'm happy, I'm
actually learning a lot.

24:34.956 --> 24:38.304
But eventually, I'm gonna
start my own business.

24:38.338 --> 24:41.169
I wanna help people to
become entrepreneurs.

24:41.203 --> 24:45.104
You know, just take this
mentality of working

24:45.138 --> 24:48.521
for someone else,
especially as Latinos.

24:49.418 --> 24:52.283
Well, we need people like you.

24:52.318 --> 24:54.734
Smart, and beautiful.

24:54.769 --> 24:56.425
[light music]

24:56.460 --> 24:59.049
Thank you, and
stop hitting on me.

24:59.083 --> 25:00.844
I'm not hitting on you.

25:00.878 --> 25:03.294
I'm just complimenting you,

25:03.329 --> 25:05.883
with a little bit
of Latin flavor.

25:05.918 --> 25:07.609
You should stop winking.

25:07.644 --> 25:10.129
You think it makes
you look attractive,

25:10.163 --> 25:12.545
but trust me, it doesn't.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.721
I'm joking.

25:17.654 --> 25:19.828
What's the most difficult
case you've had?

25:20.967 --> 25:23.763
Probably the one I just
got a few weeks ago.

25:23.798 --> 25:24.695
It's a tricky one.

25:25.903 --> 25:28.837
This owner of this
huge mall complex

25:28.872 --> 25:31.737
wants to terminate the
lease of a restaurant.

25:31.771 --> 25:33.255
Early termination.

25:33.290 --> 25:37.363
And I am convinced that
the reason is racial bias.

25:37.397 --> 25:39.917
The restaurant
owner is Latino, so.

25:41.091 --> 25:42.575
I'm very compelled
about this one.

25:42.610 --> 25:44.922
Actually, I don't know why
I'm talking about this.

25:44.957 --> 25:46.786
I barely know you.

25:46.821 --> 25:47.649
Ouch.

25:50.721 --> 25:52.516
Do you want ketchup?

25:52.551 --> 25:54.000
I like to put
ketchup on the rice.

25:54.035 --> 25:55.346
Just give me one second.

25:55.381 --> 25:56.209
Oh.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.109
With sushi?

25:59.143 --> 25:59.972
Yeah.

26:04.183 --> 26:06.116
Just in case, hot sauce.

26:06.150 --> 26:07.842
[chuckles] Funny.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.089
It seems like you're

26:14.124 --> 26:16.057
doing pretty well
yourself, aren't you?

26:17.334 --> 26:20.095
Yeah, I have your
same mentality.

26:21.614 --> 26:25.031
That's why I have
my own company.

26:25.066 --> 26:28.172
Oh, that's so cool. How
many employees do you have?

26:28.207 --> 26:29.726
Just one.

26:29.760 --> 26:32.867
It gets hectic, between
working for other companies

26:32.901 --> 26:37.665
as a freelance, and developing
Mentira,but I love it.

26:37.699 --> 26:39.287
It feels free.

26:40.668 --> 26:44.050
Is that why you don't
wanna have relationships,

26:44.085 --> 26:46.018
because you like to feel free?

26:47.398 --> 26:49.366
Well it's not that I
don't like relationships.

26:49.400 --> 26:52.818
It's just the way we
construct the rules

26:52.852 --> 26:54.613
in regards of relationships,

26:55.441 --> 26:57.443
I just, I don't like it.

26:58.409 --> 26:59.445
I don't fit in.

27:02.344 --> 27:03.863
Mm, better.

27:03.898 --> 27:04.795
What do you mean?

27:04.830 --> 27:06.383
Oh, the flavor the ketchup gives

27:06.417 --> 27:08.178
to the rice, it's amazing.

27:08.212 --> 27:10.283
I'm not talking
about your ketchup.

27:11.457 --> 27:15.323
I mean, what do you mean
that you don't fit in?

27:15.357 --> 27:18.740
Based on our culture
that is influenced

27:18.775 --> 27:21.743
by religious beliefs, to be
in a serious relationship,

27:21.778 --> 27:23.469
you need to be married.

27:23.503 --> 27:26.783
If you're a bit more liberal,
at least you need to live

27:26.817 --> 27:30.856
with a person 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.

27:30.890 --> 27:33.341
And if you decide to have kids,

27:33.375 --> 27:35.274
I mean the normal thing
to do is to marry.

27:35.308 --> 27:38.173
Yes, yes, that's normal.
What's wrong with that?

27:38.208 --> 27:41.280
I mean, that's
what's always been.

27:41.314 --> 27:44.248
I mean, we are
genetically social beings.

27:44.283 --> 27:46.872
It's in our genes
to find a partner

27:46.906 --> 27:49.253
and spend the rest of
our lives together.

27:49.288 --> 27:50.392
Yes and no.

27:50.427 --> 27:52.015
Yes, we're genetically
social beings

27:52.049 --> 27:53.879
and yes we're looking
for a partner,

27:53.913 --> 27:57.814
mostly to mate and to
spend time with them.

27:57.848 --> 28:00.955
In regard to spending the
rest of our lives together,

28:00.989 --> 28:02.163
I don't think so.

28:02.197 --> 28:03.716
That's what they
teach us and has been

28:03.751 --> 28:05.304
morally inserted in our minds.

28:05.338 --> 28:06.823
Okay, so what are you saying?

28:07.686 --> 28:09.101
What do you want?

28:09.135 --> 28:11.828
What do I want? I don't
think you'll like my answer.

28:13.001 --> 28:15.486
But, I would love
to live with someone

28:15.521 --> 28:18.075
for four days a week,
and the rest of the days,

28:18.110 --> 28:19.767
I wanna be by myself.

28:19.801 --> 28:22.839
Yeah, you definitely
don't fit the norm of what

28:22.873 --> 28:26.877
most of the world thinks
is a healthy relationship.

28:26.912 --> 28:29.466
Okay, let me ask you a question.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.537
Do you want what you
want because you came up

28:31.571 --> 28:34.402
with that decision, or because
you never had a choice,

28:34.436 --> 28:35.714
even before you were born.

28:36.680 --> 28:37.785
Think about it.

28:37.819 --> 28:40.684
Mm, maybe you're right.

28:40.719 --> 28:45.344
But, I want what I want,
no matter the reason.

28:45.378 --> 28:47.484
What's wrong with that way?

28:47.518 --> 28:50.625
And that's how democracy ends.

28:50.659 --> 28:53.697
You can't dictate
love. No one can.

28:53.732 --> 28:57.805
If you do, you will end up
in the 50% divorce statistic.

28:57.839 --> 29:01.015
Love is love, as simple as that.

29:01.049 --> 29:04.604
And I suggest that, if you
find it, don't mess with it.

29:04.639 --> 29:07.331
Because, you will lose
the chance to feel

29:07.366 --> 29:09.471
the greatest experience of all.

29:10.472 --> 29:11.680
And it's free.

29:13.613 --> 29:15.167
Money can't buy it.

29:16.513 --> 29:18.135
You know, there's a
lot of people that die

29:18.170 --> 29:19.654
without ever experience love?

29:21.932 --> 29:23.071
And I think that's sad.

29:25.073 --> 29:28.042
And you are too
cool and beautiful

29:28.076 --> 29:29.422
to let that happen to you.

29:32.978 --> 29:34.980
Are you sure you
don't want ketchup?

29:36.429 --> 29:37.327
I'm sure.

29:38.915 --> 29:39.778
It's good.

29:41.296 --> 29:42.125
I'm good.

29:42.159 --> 29:44.817
[light music]

29:44.852 --> 29:46.819
[inhaling then exhaling]

29:51.375 --> 29:54.137
[seat belt clicking]

29:54.171 --> 29:56.070
Thank you for dinner.

29:56.104 --> 29:59.556
It was, interesting.

29:59.590 --> 30:02.007
And thank you for coming.

30:03.180 --> 30:06.528
I never worked so hard to
make that dinner so nice.

30:08.737 --> 30:09.566
And,

30:11.257 --> 30:13.294
I did it for you.

30:16.228 --> 30:17.056
Thanks.

30:22.199 --> 30:25.651
[soft piano music]

30:25.685 --> 30:26.790
What?

30:26.825 --> 30:29.206
[soft music]

30:43.082 --> 30:45.947
I never kiss on the first date.

30:45.982 --> 30:47.500
You just need to say so.

30:48.674 --> 30:50.434
And this is kind
of our second date.

30:50.469 --> 30:52.781
I count our walk
as our first date.

30:52.816 --> 30:53.921
Oh, well.

30:56.268 --> 31:00.306
If that's it, then
I guess it's fine.

31:00.341 --> 31:01.135
Okay.

31:05.139 --> 31:06.830
We want different
things in life.

31:07.969 --> 31:10.799
We don't. We want
the same thing.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.491
Just under different conditions.

31:13.630 --> 31:15.287
I'm scared.

31:15.321 --> 31:18.393
Okay, you're overthinking
this way too much.

31:19.739 --> 31:22.846
Just go with the flow.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.988
Go with the flow. I
can do that [sighs].

31:28.748 --> 31:30.992
[laughing]

31:32.821 --> 31:33.788
Come here.

31:33.822 --> 31:36.411
[bright music]

31:38.966 --> 31:40.036
I need to go.

31:40.070 --> 31:41.071
Wait, Rocio, wait.

31:42.970 --> 31:46.042
To overcome your fears,
you must face them.

31:47.112 --> 31:48.768
Doing so will make you grow.

31:48.803 --> 31:52.048
What starts as fear
would turn into courage.

31:52.082 --> 31:54.705
And courage is what
heroes are made of.

31:58.606 --> 32:00.988
That's a phrase from Kaon.

32:02.748 --> 32:03.818
I wanna break my rule.

32:04.992 --> 32:06.545
I wanna have more
dates with you.

32:08.167 --> 32:09.168
Can you break yours?

32:10.687 --> 32:11.895
Which one?

32:11.930 --> 32:13.932
To date someone that
doesn't believe in

32:13.966 --> 32:14.933
what you believe in.

32:16.693 --> 32:18.488
You have my number.

32:18.522 --> 32:19.351
Okay.

32:21.215 --> 32:22.147
Good night.

32:23.458 --> 32:24.735
Good night.

-Hola.
-Hola.

33:06.743 --> 33:08.365
Are you free on Friday night?

33:08.400 --> 33:09.297
Yeah.

33:09.332 --> 33:11.886
Great, can you come to my place?

33:11.920 --> 33:13.853
You did something nice for you,

33:13.888 --> 33:15.890
and I wanna do
something nice for you.

33:15.924 --> 33:17.029
Okay.

33:17.064 --> 33:17.996
What are you gonna do?

33:18.030 --> 33:19.963
You'll see. Just come at seven.

33:19.998 --> 33:23.380
Okay, and please no
questions. Can you come?

33:23.415 --> 33:24.312
Yeah.

33:24.347 --> 33:27.729
Okay, it's a surprise. Bye.

ready in five minutes.

36:27.702 --> 36:28.807
Let me wash my face.

36:29.704 --> 36:32.293
[upbeat music on speakers]

36:43.649 --> 36:45.651
Rocio, it's ready!

36:49.724 --> 36:53.383
[speaking foreign language]

36:56.421 --> 36:58.112
Do you have ketchup?

36:59.217 --> 37:00.977
It's in the cabinet
by the fridge.

37:04.601 --> 37:06.120
I had fun last night.

37:06.154 --> 37:08.295
I never expected for
you to move like that.

37:11.677 --> 37:13.300
I think that's a little
bit inappropriate,

37:13.334 --> 37:15.163
don't you think?

37:15.198 --> 37:16.579
What?

37:16.613 --> 37:19.237
Oh, no no no, I'm not talking
about the sex movements.

37:19.271 --> 37:21.066
I was talking about
the dance movements.

37:21.100 --> 37:25.553
Oh, thank you. What
about the sex movements?

37:25.588 --> 37:28.901
The sex movements was fantastic.

37:28.936 --> 37:32.629
Amazing, like, love it.

37:32.664 --> 37:33.837
[bottle squirting]

37:33.872 --> 37:36.978
Do you put ketchup
on everything?

37:37.013 --> 37:38.808
Yeah, kind of.

37:39.947 --> 37:41.742
I did something for you.

37:41.776 --> 37:44.262
Because I ripped your
favorite panties last night,

37:45.470 --> 37:48.300
I fixed them up for you.

37:48.335 --> 37:50.371
Isn't this beauty? Look at this.

37:50.406 --> 37:52.304
I put the gift I
gave you to good use.

37:54.444 --> 37:57.136
My God, you're too much.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.761
This is nice, right?

38:01.727 --> 38:02.556
What?

38:03.764 --> 38:04.868
Having fun together.

38:07.008 --> 38:09.321
Yeah, it feels nice.

38:09.356 --> 38:12.290
[soft piano music]

38:17.018 --> 38:19.400
Thank you for last night.

38:19.435 --> 38:20.298
Thank you.

38:21.540 --> 38:22.369
Bye.

38:35.451 --> 38:36.624
Bye.

38:36.659 --> 38:37.832
Bye.

38:37.867 --> 38:40.766
[soft piano music]

38:59.958 --> 39:00.786
Rocio?

39:04.618 --> 39:07.966
I'm a traditional guy, so I
will ask this just one time.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.590
I know it's silly, and I
won't ask this anymore.

39:11.625 --> 39:12.971
But I'm gonna do it.

39:14.524 --> 39:16.975
[soft music]

39:27.365 --> 39:29.746
[speaking foreign language]

39:33.129 --> 39:35.649
Well, Mr. Giancarlo,

39:41.482 --> 39:43.588
I am a traditional
woman as well,

39:43.622 --> 39:47.212
and I also think it's very
soon, but what the heck.

39:48.213 --> 39:49.007
Really?

39:49.041 --> 39:50.042
Yes.

39:50.077 --> 39:51.492
You superhero, you.

39:52.769 --> 39:55.496
I don't know. I just did it
so you were more comfortable.

39:55.531 --> 39:56.497
Okay, I can give you
a superhero name.

39:56.532 --> 39:58.085
I don't want a superhero name.

39:58.119 --> 39:59.500
What about Super Burleska?

39:59.535 --> 40:00.881
Or Super Sex Dancer?

40:00.915 --> 40:01.813
Or Super Squeeze--

40:01.847 --> 40:03.228
Stop, no, please, no.

40:03.262 --> 40:05.126
You're ruining the moment.

40:05.161 --> 40:05.989
Okay.

40:08.060 --> 40:08.889
Better.

40:12.099 --> 40:12.962
I'm gonna go now.

40:14.688 --> 40:17.622
[soft piano music]

40:18.554 --> 40:19.831
I'm gonna close the door.

40:19.865 --> 40:20.659
Okay.

40:20.694 --> 40:21.522
Okay?

40:22.454 --> 40:23.213
Adios.

40:23.248 --> 40:25.768
[door closing]

40:25.802 --> 40:28.702
[soft piano music]

40:42.370 --> 40:45.028
Natalie, please.

40:46.236 --> 40:48.307
Promise me that you're
going to behave.

40:48.342 --> 40:50.068
I promise.

40:50.102 --> 40:51.794
Why do you worry so much?

40:51.828 --> 40:53.934
Clearly, you like the guy, so.

40:55.556 --> 40:57.558
Why won't you tell me who it is?

40:57.593 --> 41:00.043
Well, you're gonna
meet him very soon, so.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.429
[phone dinging]

41:08.535 --> 41:09.397
All right.

41:10.847 --> 41:12.055
Rocio picked up Natalie.

41:13.609 --> 41:14.817
Let's go.

41:14.851 --> 41:17.164
Okay. Hey, don't bring
up comics during dinner.

41:21.686 --> 41:22.687
Why?

41:22.721 --> 41:24.965
Natalie's gonna question
your level of maturity.

41:24.999 --> 41:26.449
Trust me.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.830
She's gonna scrutinize your
every move and make sure

41:27.864 --> 41:30.211
you're the perfect candidate
for Rocio to marry.

41:31.281 --> 41:32.420
Look, I don't wanna get married.

41:32.455 --> 41:34.250
I know. You're screwed.

41:34.284 --> 41:36.528
And she definitely didn't
forget meeting you.

41:38.254 --> 41:40.049
I just needed to get
acquainted and meet her.

41:40.083 --> 41:41.153
Come on, let's go.

41:42.085 --> 41:43.155
And no quotes.

41:44.881 --> 41:45.710
What else?

41:47.056 --> 41:48.644
You know what? Just don't talk.

41:52.026 --> 41:53.269
Of course.

41:53.303 --> 41:55.064
Hello, ladies, you
both look beautiful.

41:55.098 --> 41:56.548
[Rocio] Thank you.

41:56.583 --> 41:57.653
Hello, hello, hello.

41:58.654 --> 42:00.483
No, you?

42:00.518 --> 42:01.449
Natalie.

1:05:10.630 --> 1:05:13.461
I love working out around
these beautiful houses.

1:05:15.773 --> 1:05:16.602
Yeah.

1:05:17.983 --> 1:05:22.056
Actually, I was
thinking to buy a house.

1:05:24.161 --> 1:05:25.991
You wanna buy a house now?

1:05:26.025 --> 1:05:28.027
Yeah, with you.

1:05:30.754 --> 1:05:32.411
Oh, well.

1:05:33.722 --> 1:05:35.172
I don't know.

1:05:35.207 --> 1:05:38.106
I was thinking to save at
least for one more year.

1:05:38.141 --> 1:05:39.211
I mean, we've been
living together

1:05:39.245 --> 1:05:41.558
for almost a year now.

1:05:41.592 --> 1:05:44.699
You've saved a lot of
money, plus my money.

1:05:44.733 --> 1:05:45.700
It would be enough.

1:05:46.597 --> 1:05:48.703
I don't know. Besides--

1:05:49.531 --> 1:05:51.085
Besides what?

1:05:51.119 --> 1:05:55.330
Our relationship. I don't
think it's mature enough.

1:05:55.365 --> 1:05:57.608
I mean, a serious
couple should have

1:05:57.643 --> 1:06:00.197
at least one shared
bank account.

1:06:00.232 --> 1:06:03.580
And if we buy a house
without being married

1:06:03.614 --> 1:06:06.479
we won't have the same
legal protections.

1:06:06.514 --> 1:06:08.861
We will have to
buy it as a couple.

1:06:08.895 --> 1:06:12.278
Yeah, so that's what we
are. We're just a couple.

1:06:12.313 --> 1:06:15.212
You know, we sign the
title as tenants in common.

1:06:15.247 --> 1:06:19.044
We just co-own the
house, both of us.

1:06:19.078 --> 1:06:20.631
Come on, it's not complicated.

1:06:20.666 --> 1:06:23.600
We just pay half the mortgage,
half of the down payment.

1:06:23.634 --> 1:06:25.878
We both co-own the house.

1:06:25.912 --> 1:06:26.741
It's simple.

1:06:31.435 --> 1:06:35.163
I don't know. Let
me think about it.

1:06:35.198 --> 1:06:40.099
We'll just buy some food,
and we can talk about it.

1:06:40.134 --> 1:06:42.999
[traffic passing]

1:07:01.086 --> 1:07:02.328
Are you okay?

1:07:04.123 --> 1:07:04.951
I'm okay.

1:07:04.986 --> 1:07:06.574
[Phone voice] False.

1:07:06.608 --> 1:07:07.471
What's that?

1:07:07.506 --> 1:07:09.232
That's Mentira.

1:07:09.266 --> 1:07:12.476
I'm testing it, and it looks
like it's working perfectly.

1:07:14.892 --> 1:07:16.342
What's going on?

1:07:16.377 --> 1:07:18.862
If we're gonna make the
decision of buying a house

1:07:18.896 --> 1:07:22.590
together, we're gonna
make it inside the circle.

1:07:22.624 --> 1:07:23.901
I mean, we can use Mentira.

1:07:26.283 --> 1:07:27.698
We're doing it old school.

1:07:35.499 --> 1:07:36.707
Speak with your heart.

1:07:38.330 --> 1:07:39.745
Okay, okay.

1:07:41.091 --> 1:07:43.507
Do you wanna buy
a house with me?

1:07:43.542 --> 1:07:44.612
Yeah.

1:07:44.646 --> 1:07:45.475
[Phone voice] True.

1:07:55.761 --> 1:07:57.728
Do you think that
buying a house with me

1:07:57.763 --> 1:08:00.110
is a step forward
in our relationship?

1:08:00.145 --> 1:08:01.422
Of course.

1:08:01.456 --> 1:08:02.388
How?

1:08:02.423 --> 1:08:04.149
We are already living together,

1:08:04.183 --> 1:08:07.013
and we're sharing expenses
and responsibilities.

1:08:08.153 --> 1:08:09.947
This one would be a bigger one,

1:08:09.982 --> 1:08:12.191
like more commitment
to the relationship.

1:08:13.123 --> 1:08:16.953
Plus, it'd be our first
investment as a couple.

1:08:18.163 --> 1:08:19.129
That's big.

1:08:20.095 --> 1:08:21.304
Equal parts?

1:08:21.337 --> 1:08:22.649
Yeah.

1:08:22.684 --> 1:08:23.513
Okay.

1:08:25.584 --> 1:08:26.447
It's my turn now.

1:08:36.422 --> 1:08:38.183
[phone ticking]

1:08:40.425 --> 1:08:43.671
What do you want?

1:08:43.705 --> 1:08:46.260
I wanna buy a house, and

1:08:47.468 --> 1:08:49.849
I do wanna buy a house with you.

1:08:49.884 --> 1:08:50.711
[Phone voice] True.

1:08:57.547 --> 1:09:00.514
But I don't wanna
buy it like this.

1:09:00.550 --> 1:09:01.378
[Phone voice] True.

1:09:05.210 --> 1:09:07.833
It sounds more like a
business proposition

1:09:07.867 --> 1:09:11.871
than a couple moving forward
with their relationship.

1:09:13.907 --> 1:09:16.979
Most couples buy a house
because they're married

1:09:17.014 --> 1:09:19.741
or they plan to do so.

1:09:19.776 --> 1:09:23.124
Because they're gonna build
a future in that house.

1:09:24.505 --> 1:09:26.471
But you don't
believe in marriage.

1:09:26.506 --> 1:09:29.958
And I respect that, but
I don't wanna buy a house

1:09:29.993 --> 1:09:33.824
for equity or to
diversify my money.

1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:37.551
If I was to buy
a house with you,

1:09:39.589 --> 1:09:44.387
it would be because we're
gonna fill it with love

1:09:45.559 --> 1:09:48.839
and a family and
a future together.

1:09:53.499 --> 1:09:54.431
I love you.

1:09:56.157 --> 1:09:57.123
I really do.

1:10:00.023 --> 1:10:04.165
Maybe it's, it's like you say.

1:10:08.790 --> 1:10:10.585
Love is not enough.

1:10:10.620 --> 1:10:11.897
[Phone voice] True.

1:10:15.245 --> 1:10:17.316
I don't wanna buy
a house with you.

1:10:21.493 --> 1:10:23.460
At least not right now.

1:10:23.495 --> 1:10:24.323
[Phone voice] True.

1:10:25.393 --> 1:10:26.222
So when?

1:10:29.052 --> 1:10:30.571
When would be the right moment?

1:10:32.434 --> 1:10:34.091
Feels like never.

1:10:34.126 --> 1:10:37.025
[soft piano music]

1:11:00.428 --> 1:11:03.017
[bird calling]

1:11:04.121 --> 1:11:06.916
[soft piano music]

1:11:27.144 --> 1:11:28.525
Where were you?

1:11:30.077 --> 1:11:31.632
I've been calling you all day.

1:11:37.776 --> 1:11:38.777
We need to talk.

1:11:41.124 --> 1:11:41.952
Talk.

1:11:45.541 --> 1:11:47.337
I've been thinking
a lot about us.

1:11:50.375 --> 1:11:51.859
About our relationship.

1:11:57.485 --> 1:12:00.350
Giancarlo, the love
I feel for you,

1:12:03.180 --> 1:12:04.353
I never felt before.

1:12:10.395 --> 1:12:12.327
But I'm just realizing that

1:12:14.639 --> 1:12:17.850
you are never gonna give
me the life I dreamed of.

1:12:20.474 --> 1:12:21.785
I don't understand why.

1:12:24.892 --> 1:12:26.652
We can buy the
house that you want.

1:12:28.205 --> 1:12:31.898
We can fill it with
children, love,

1:12:33.349 --> 1:12:34.142
A cat.

1:12:35.627 --> 1:12:37.249
Everything that you want.

1:12:38.802 --> 1:12:41.909
We can occupy the same
space as a married couple,

1:12:43.013 --> 1:12:46.568
with the same feelings,
the same feelings.

1:12:48.847 --> 1:12:50.780
We just don't have
that contract.

1:12:52.644 --> 1:12:55.267
It's not just the contract.

1:12:56.993 --> 1:12:59.960
It's what the
contract represents.

1:13:01.998 --> 1:13:05.967
It's the wedding, the dress.

1:13:06.002 --> 1:13:08.522
It's saying in front of
everybody that we know

1:13:08.556 --> 1:13:10.213
that we love each other.

1:13:10.246 --> 1:13:13.665
It's saying before God that
we will take care of us

1:13:13.699 --> 1:13:16.875
till death tear us apart.

1:13:16.909 --> 1:13:18.255
But what's the difference?

1:13:18.290 --> 1:13:21.500
I can buy a huge thing
saying I love you.

1:13:21.535 --> 1:13:24.952
I can say it on the radio,
tell God that I love you.

1:13:26.746 --> 1:13:29.957
The commitment I have
for you needs no paper.

1:13:31.855 --> 1:13:35.411
No paper, the commitment
is my love for you.

1:13:39.068 --> 1:13:41.106
And I wanna live by
your side forever.

1:13:42.934 --> 1:13:45.628
Not even death will
break us apart.

1:13:52.219 --> 1:13:53.601
What if we have kids?

1:13:55.050 --> 1:13:56.570
What are we gonna tell them?

1:13:56.603 --> 1:13:58.019
What?

1:13:58.054 --> 1:13:59.227
That we're not married?

1:14:01.609 --> 1:14:04.335
You know how many kids grow
up without a dad or a mom?

1:14:05.682 --> 1:14:08.340
Every family is different.

1:14:08.374 --> 1:14:10.480
You're just stuck with the
ritual that you grew up with,

1:14:10.514 --> 1:14:12.137
and you can't get it
out of your system.

1:14:12.171 --> 1:14:13.241
Stop with the ritual please.

1:14:13.276 --> 1:14:14.588
But it's true, Rocio.

1:14:16.348 --> 1:14:18.454
It's not about that.

1:14:19.351 --> 1:14:21.041
Can't you see?

1:14:22.250 --> 1:14:24.183
It's about us.

1:14:27.152 --> 1:14:28.429
We want different things.

1:14:29.568 --> 1:14:32.191
You don't even want
a shared account.

1:14:37.645 --> 1:14:40.406
You love dogs. I love cats.

1:14:40.441 --> 1:14:42.684
You work from home.
I work at the office.

1:14:42.719 --> 1:14:47.724
I love being around people,
and you love your solitude.

1:14:49.174 --> 1:14:51.866
Can you still tell me that
our differences are nothing?

1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:54.731
That they're insignificant?

1:14:57.941 --> 1:15:02.359
And you, Mr. "I
Don't Give a Shit."

1:15:02.394 --> 1:15:05.949
Mr. "I Am the Smartest
Person on Planet Earth,"

1:15:05.984 --> 1:15:09.366
and I cannot get bothered by
the pettiness of us mortals.

1:15:09.401 --> 1:15:10.816
What are you talking about?

1:15:11.782 --> 1:15:13.992
You're so full of shit.

1:15:14.026 --> 1:15:15.925
I'm the one full of shit?

1:15:15.959 --> 1:15:19.860
I'm the one that lives like
everybody else on Planet Earth?

1:15:20.826 --> 1:15:22.897
Because if you're not happy,

1:15:24.071 --> 1:15:25.624
I want a husband,
I want a house,

1:15:25.659 --> 1:15:28.385
I want, I want, I want, I want.

1:15:29.421 --> 1:15:31.285
That's what you said, I want.

1:15:35.151 --> 1:15:36.117
Fuck you.

1:15:36.152 --> 1:15:36.980
Fuck me.

1:15:38.223 --> 1:15:40.674
You don't want that many things.

1:15:40.708 --> 1:15:44.781
You just are,
Rocio, you just are.

1:15:44.816 --> 1:15:45.644
You're right.

1:15:48.785 --> 1:15:50.442
But I can't just be.

1:15:52.582 --> 1:15:55.723
Because you, you're the only one

1:15:55.758 --> 1:15:59.244
in between me and
my happy future.

1:15:59.278 --> 1:16:03.179
Hm.

1:16:03.213 --> 1:16:06.596
This relationship, it's like
a high school relationship,

1:16:06.630 --> 1:16:09.116
just fucking without a plan.

1:16:09.150 --> 1:16:10.807
So much education for what?

1:16:10.842 --> 1:16:12.395
Don't bring my education.

1:16:12.429 --> 1:16:13.879
Yes, why?

1:16:13.914 --> 1:16:16.364
Because you can't comprehend
the simplicity of things.

1:16:16.398 --> 1:16:17.642
You just don't see.

1:16:19.954 --> 1:16:23.094
Your simplicity,
it's on your favor.

1:16:24.371 --> 1:16:26.789
I am not a girl anymore.

1:16:27.962 --> 1:16:30.309
You are wasting my time.

1:16:30.344 --> 1:16:32.311
Really? What about mytime?

1:16:32.346 --> 1:16:34.003
What about yourtime?

1:16:34.037 --> 1:16:36.799
You already have the
life that you dream.

1:16:38.214 --> 1:16:42.943
You work from home. You
have your comic shit hobby.

1:16:42.977 --> 1:16:44.978
You are fucking me.

1:16:45.014 --> 1:16:47.706
You can retire tomorrow
if you would like to.

1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:51.330
Your simplicity
is in your favor.

1:16:53.850 --> 1:16:58.614
No. My simplicity
is in ourfavor.

1:16:59.718 --> 1:17:01.202
Because my simplicity is you.

1:17:02.963 --> 1:17:04.620
You are my simple life.

1:17:07.657 --> 1:17:08.762
Because I love you.

1:17:11.316 --> 1:17:12.938
But like I said before, no?

1:17:14.630 --> 1:17:19.496
Love is not enough for you,
and it will never be enough.

1:17:19.531 --> 1:17:22.430
[soft piano music]

1:17:25.192 --> 1:17:29.023
You're right. It's not enough.

1:17:30.715 --> 1:17:35.202
Because love, it's
surrounded by real life.

1:17:36.513 --> 1:17:39.758
But you, you don't
wanna live on it.

Come through the back door!

1:18:10.755 --> 1:18:11.825
What are you doing?

1:18:14.690 --> 1:18:15.587
Really?

1:18:15.621 --> 1:18:18.383
Maybe, I don't know.

1:18:18.416 --> 1:18:20.178
We'll find out in
a couple minutes.

1:18:24.423 --> 1:18:26.563
Oh yeah, I love being a writer.

1:18:27.737 --> 1:18:30.084

nominated for an Eisner,

Oh shit, aw.

1:18:36.469 --> 1:18:40.888
Dude. Dude, what the fuck?

1:18:40.923 --> 1:18:42.096
What was that?

That's Mentira,fuck, it
smells in here.

1:18:43.788 --> 1:18:46.480
Well it's the goddam bacchanal
you gave me the other day.

1:18:46.514 --> 1:18:47.412
Shut the door.

1:18:49.552 --> 1:18:52.762
Remember when I told
you that I was fine

1:18:52.797 --> 1:18:55.523
with us wanting
different things in life?

1:18:55.558 --> 1:18:56.800
Mm-hm, yeah.

1:18:57.974 --> 1:19:01.909
The reality is that,
I'm not fine with it.

1:19:03.462 --> 1:19:04.843
At all.

1:19:04.878 --> 1:19:08.882
And the more time that
pass, the more I realize it.

1:19:09.606 --> 1:19:11.228
Where were we?

1:19:11.263 --> 1:19:13.507
Hold on. Dude, what the--?

1:19:13.541 --> 1:19:15.335
Just tuck it in, man, so
the smell doesn't come out.

1:19:15.371 --> 1:19:17.235
Okay, can you just wait?

1:19:17.269 --> 1:19:19.030
I need to talk to you now.
Put the phone on mute.

1:19:19.064 --> 1:19:19.858
Just tuck it in.

1:19:19.893 --> 1:19:20.825
It is on mute.

1:19:22.343 --> 1:19:24.068
You know, I hate
being interrupted

1:19:24.103 --> 1:19:25.208
when I'm taking a shit.

1:19:25.243 --> 1:19:27.555
I'm desperate [speaks
foreign language].

1:19:27.797 --> 1:19:29.557
Okay, what's going on?

1:19:29.592 --> 1:19:31.525
But I thought he
wanted a family too?

1:19:32.112 --> 1:19:33.182
Yes.

1:19:34.770 --> 1:19:37.876
But he doesn't want
it the same way I do.

1:19:37.911 --> 1:19:40.603
I don't know why,
but getting married

1:19:42.018 --> 1:19:46.540
and starting a family, it's
the biggest dream of my life.

1:19:46.989 --> 1:19:49.992
And make it quick, this
is a comic book artist.

1:19:50.026 --> 1:19:52.235
I don't know what I'm
gonna do, you know.

1:19:52.270 --> 1:19:53.409
I don't wanna lose her.

1:19:56.308 --> 1:19:58.379
Okay, let me tell you something.

1:19:58.414 --> 1:20:01.072
Marriage is way overrated.

1:20:01.106 --> 1:20:03.384
And at the beginning,
it was great.

1:20:04.903 --> 1:20:06.284
But now...

1:20:07.837 --> 1:20:10.046
[sighs] not so much.

1:20:10.081 --> 1:20:11.599
Would you rather be single then?

1:20:11.634 --> 1:20:14.499
Oh no. No, no, no, honey.

1:20:14.532 --> 1:20:17.571
Single, me? At my age,
that would just be weird.

1:20:20.056 --> 1:20:21.886
Are you crying?

1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:23.611
What? I'm not crying.

1:20:23.646 --> 1:20:25.648
It's the shit.

1:20:25.682 --> 1:20:28.271
I don't know. It looks
like you wanna cry.

1:20:30.584 --> 1:20:33.242
Huh, this is very interesting.

1:20:34.621 --> 1:20:37.902
And for the first time,
Giancarlo Panetta is confused,

1:20:37.936 --> 1:20:40.559
completely clueless
about what to do.

1:20:40.594 --> 1:20:43.630
I'm never, ever, not
gonna be married.

1:20:43.666 --> 1:20:47.083
It's just, I need that
peace of mind, you know.

1:20:48.532 --> 1:20:51.950
I'm married, and I like
how it sounds. I'm married.

1:20:52.986 --> 1:20:54.193
You know, I ...

1:20:56.610 --> 1:20:58.681
Okay, you know what
you do every time I go

1:20:58.715 --> 1:20:59.924
to ask you for advice?

1:20:59.958 --> 1:21:01.166
This is what you tell me.

1:21:02.478 --> 1:21:06.550
[imitating] Don't worry,
everything's gonna be okay.

1:21:08.794 --> 1:21:10.382
You need to grow up.

1:21:12.143 --> 1:21:13.903
Well you know what,
as your hombre,

1:21:13.938 --> 1:21:16.318
you need to stop being
a baby and grow up.

1:21:16.353 --> 1:21:17.493
What do you want?

1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:22.878
I'm pregnant!

1:21:25.777 --> 1:21:27.986
Congratulations.

1:21:28.021 --> 1:21:29.712
I'm gonna be a mommy.

1:21:29.746 --> 1:21:31.162
I wanna be a mommy too.

1:21:32.232 --> 1:21:33.889
Oh you will be.

1:21:33.923 --> 1:21:36.029
Just don't wait too long,
because we're getting old.

1:21:36.063 --> 1:21:38.928
I mean, in 10 years we'll
be middle-aged women.

1:21:38.963 --> 1:21:39.825
What?

1:21:41.034 --> 1:21:41.897
Oh.

1:21:43.139 --> 1:21:44.934
Oh, come here.

1:21:44.969 --> 1:21:47.661
Oh, honey.

1:21:47.695 --> 1:21:49.249
I'm so happy for you.

1:21:49.282 --> 1:21:50.629
Aw, thank you.

1:21:52.700 --> 1:21:54.150
Congratulations.

1:21:58.430 --> 1:22:00.329
So what do you really want?

1:22:00.362 --> 1:22:01.537
Because you know what
I want is for you

1:22:01.571 --> 1:22:02.745
to get out of my bathroom.

1:22:02.779 --> 1:22:04.264
This is when the
king uses his throne,

1:22:04.298 --> 1:22:06.438
and what the king wants
is what the king wants.

1:22:06.473 --> 1:22:07.300
El Campion.

1:22:08.337 --> 1:22:09.165
Sorry.

1:22:10.304 --> 1:22:14.964
You know what? Your version
of me is actually right.

1:22:14.999 --> 1:22:16.068
And you know why
I always tell you

1:22:16.103 --> 1:22:17.553
the same crap all the time?

1:22:18.726 --> 1:22:20.245
Because the moment
you stop lying,

1:22:20.280 --> 1:22:22.730
you will find the person
you've been looking for.

1:22:23.939 --> 1:22:26.527
[gentle music]

1:22:27.735 --> 1:22:28.564
Yeah.

1:22:30.946 --> 1:22:32.016
[Justin] Hey, sorry.

1:22:33.189 --> 1:22:35.916
Listen, I have to
tell you something.

1:22:37.021 --> 1:22:40.023
I actually never got
nominated for an Eisner.

1:22:40.058 --> 1:22:40.921
[Phone voice] True.

1:22:50.931 --> 1:22:53.865

1:23:49.610 --> 1:23:52.544
[soft piano music]

1:23:54.098 --> 1:23:56.202
I know we want different
things in life,

1:23:58.481 --> 1:24:01.484
and I feel we're growing
further from each other,

1:24:01.519 --> 1:24:03.452
but I want to keep
that from happening.

1:24:04.728 --> 1:24:07.076
My feelings for you are too
strong to let that happen.

1:24:08.250 --> 1:24:12.047
The bond of love is too
powerful to be broken.

1:24:13.702 --> 1:24:14.532
Kaon?

1:24:18.432 --> 1:24:19.088
Me.

1:24:19.675 --> 1:24:22.574
[soft piano music]

1:24:24.541 --> 1:24:27.545
[crickets chirping]

1:24:31.100 --> 1:24:35.794
Rocio Hernandez,
will you marry me?

1:24:35.829 --> 1:24:38.728
[soft piano music]

1:24:56.712 --> 1:25:01.130
I love you, but you're
just doing this for me.

1:25:03.028 --> 1:25:06.239
I'm doing this for both of us.

1:25:06.273 --> 1:25:09.068
We're in the circle of honesty.

1:25:10.174 --> 1:25:12.555
Look me in the eye,
and tell me that...

1:25:14.350 --> 1:25:15.558
you believe in marriage.

1:25:18.077 --> 1:25:22.393
I believe what marriage
represents and stands for.

1:25:22.427 --> 1:25:25.430
[crickets chirping]

1:25:27.260 --> 1:25:32.023
But, I don't believe in
marriage the same way you do.

1:25:35.785 --> 1:25:38.340
I can't marry you, Giancarlo.

1:25:42.516 --> 1:25:43.309
I'm sorry.

1:25:46.657 --> 1:25:47.934
For both of us.

1:25:52.388 --> 1:25:55.288
[soft piano music]

1:26:21.452 --> 1:26:22.280
Rocio?

1:26:27.285 --> 1:26:30.978
[speaking foreign language]

1:26:33.671 --> 1:26:35.880
You look as beautiful as always.

1:26:36.812 --> 1:26:40.919
And you look beautiful as well.

1:26:42.231 --> 1:26:45.303
No. No, no, no, don't hide
it. Let me see this.

1:26:45.510 --> 1:26:47.340
Oh, the ring looks beautiful.

1:26:50.929 --> 1:26:51.930
What about you?

1:26:54.830 --> 1:26:56.003
Are you seeing someone?

1:26:58.385 --> 1:26:59.523
Why do I even ask?

1:27:02.251 --> 1:27:03.356
You are who you are.

1:27:05.116 --> 1:27:06.807
And you are who you are,

1:27:06.842 --> 1:27:10.017
and you are, glowing.

1:27:11.502 --> 1:27:13.745
Did you get him
inside the circle?

1:27:13.780 --> 1:27:17.646
No, he said it was
a child's game,

1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:19.820
and because it
comes from you, so.

1:27:23.962 --> 1:27:25.964
I'm happy for you. I really am.

1:27:29.071 --> 1:27:32.868
I wish you a...beautiful life.

1:27:34.076 --> 1:27:34.904
Thanks.

1:27:36.251 --> 1:27:37.079
I do too.

1:27:42.567 --> 1:27:43.465
I gotta go.

1:27:50.126 --> 1:27:51.921
Love never dies.

1:27:51.956 --> 1:27:54.441
It transforms. It evolves.

1:27:56.616 --> 1:27:58.273
But it will always be love.

1:27:58.307 --> 1:27:59.135
Kaon?

1:28:04.416 --> 1:28:05.314
I love you.

1:28:07.799 --> 1:28:09.145
I love you too.

1:28:19.432 --> 1:28:20.433

1:28:21.123 --> 1:28:21.916
Bye.

1:28:21.951 --> 1:28:25.058
[gentle piano music]

1:28:38.243 --> 1:28:39.175
You okay?

1:28:40.073 --> 1:28:42.282
You've been quiet all day.

1:28:42.317 --> 1:28:43.214
I'm fine.

1:28:47.011 --> 1:28:49.462
This is the day that
I've been waiting for

1:28:49.496 --> 1:28:50.911
my whole life, right?

1:28:50.946 --> 1:28:54.225
Yes, it's so exciting.
It's your dream.

1:28:55.606 --> 1:28:58.193
It's gonna be a
beautiful, beautiful day.

1:28:58.228 --> 1:28:59.368
And...

1:28:59.403 --> 1:29:02.198
...my God, you look
absolutely gorgeous.

1:29:03.371 --> 1:29:05.650
I can't wait to see you
walk down that aisle.

1:29:06.513 --> 1:29:08.343
You're gonna be married today.

1:29:09.413 --> 1:29:10.724
Oh, you look so pretty.

1:29:10.759 --> 1:29:11.587
It's your day.

1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:14.693
Hold on.

1:29:17.386 --> 1:29:19.250
Are you sure you're okay?

1:29:19.284 --> 1:29:20.112
Yeah.

1:29:25.049 --> 1:29:26.947
Just give me one second, okay?

1:29:31.538 --> 1:29:34.264
Um, do you wanna talk?

1:29:36.163 --> 1:29:37.682
I'm here if you wanna talk.

1:29:38.959 --> 1:29:41.306
Anything you wanna say is ...

1:29:44.758 --> 1:29:46.553
Your mom's waiting for us too.

1:29:46.588 --> 1:29:48.900
Okay, just give me one second.

1:29:48.934 --> 1:29:49.763
Okay.

1:29:53.940 --> 1:29:54.768
Um.

1:29:59.463 --> 1:30:00.291
Sorry.

1:30:02.742 --> 1:30:04.121
I'm okay.

1:30:04.157 --> 1:30:04.985
Really.

1:30:08.472 --> 1:30:10.300
Where are you going?

1:30:11.233 --> 1:30:12.889
Everything's fine.

1:31:02.387 --> 1:31:03.181

1:31:07.565 --> 1:31:11.258
[speaking foreign language]

1:31:15.159 --> 1:31:16.885
Did you change him?

1:31:16.919 --> 1:31:18.264
Yeah.

1:31:18.300 --> 1:31:20.198
I don't know where
the shits come from.

1:31:20.233 --> 1:31:22.200
I already told
you to stop saying

1:31:22.235 --> 1:31:23.374
that word in front of him.

1:31:23.407 --> 1:31:25.237
[speaking foreign language]

1:31:25.859 --> 1:31:27.273
Your mom is ready?

1:31:27.309 --> 1:31:29.276
Yes, she's actually
waiting for us.

1:31:35.904 --> 1:31:38.562
I been thinking for a while now.

1:31:42.876 --> 1:31:44.395
I don't need this.

1:31:45.534 --> 1:31:46.362
Are you sure?

1:31:47.502 --> 1:31:48.675
Yeah.

1:31:48.710 --> 1:31:50.677
It was your idea to get
engaged indefinitely.

1:31:50.712 --> 1:31:51.505
I know.

1:31:52.852 --> 1:31:55.302
But I have everything I wanted.

Got it.

1:32:21.950 --> 1:32:24.918
