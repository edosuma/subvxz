So I hear.

27:59.400 --> 28:03.199
He would speak with you again
on the last night of his life.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.079
Then you will harm nobody in this place.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.799
Not one person. Are we very, very clear?

28:08.320 --> 28:09.599
(HISSING)

28:15.200 --> 28:16.799
(SNAKES HISSING)

28:24.200 --> 28:28.239
Are you so dangerous, little man?

28:32.120 --> 28:34.439
You want to know how dangerous I am?

28:34.520 --> 28:35.719
Davros sent you.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.199
You know how stupid you are?

28:37.320 --> 28:38.559
(SCOFFS) You came!

28:38.720 --> 28:40.119
(HISSES)

28:41.120 --> 28:42.639
Is that supposed to frighten me?

28:42.720 --> 28:44.519
Snake nest in a dress!

28:44.600 --> 28:47.039
Now, explain politely.

28:48.680 --> 28:51.959
Davros is my archenemy.
Why would I want to talk to him?

28:52.040 --> 28:54.519
Hang on a minute.
Davros is your archenemy now?

28:54.600 --> 28:56.519
-Hush!
-I'll scratch his eye out.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.199
Davros knows.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.359
Davros remembers.

29:15.800 --> 29:16.879
That's yours.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.119
Uh, it was.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.119
Was?

29:25.040 --> 29:27.239
I don't have a screwdriver any more.

29:27.640 --> 29:28.959
Ooh!

29:29.960 --> 29:31.799
Never seen that before.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.479
Doctor, the look on your face.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.279
What is that?

29:38.040 --> 29:39.039
Shame.

29:42.640 --> 29:43.919
You're ashamed.

29:48.280 --> 29:49.279
Doctor?

29:51.520 --> 29:52.599
What have you done?

29:53.720 --> 29:55.999
YOUNG DAVROS:
Please, you've got to help me.

29:57.600 --> 30:01.119
You said I could survive,
you said you'd help me!

30:04.520 --> 30:05.759
Help me!

30:20.040 --> 30:21.479
Is your ship in orbit?

30:22.280 --> 30:23.519
It's a trap.

30:23.720 --> 30:25.639
Prepare yourself for teleport.

30:25.720 --> 30:28.759
Doctor, listen to me.
I know traps. Traps are my flirting.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.199
This is a trap!

30:31.240 --> 30:33.679
I am prepared.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.039
You sent me your confession dial.

30:36.120 --> 30:39.239
You threw yourself a three-week party.
You know what this is!

30:39.320 --> 30:40.399
Yes.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.519
Goodbye.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.199
Goodbye, Clara.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.159
(HISSING)

31:03.840 --> 31:05.039
We're coming with him.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.639
Both of us, her and me.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.959
No, no, no, no! Under no circumstances!

31:10.360 --> 31:12.679
-What are you doing now?
-Voting.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.439
We are a democracy.

31:16.720 --> 31:17.919
It is agreed.

31:18.280 --> 31:20.519
No, no, no! I forbid it. No!

31:20.600 --> 31:23.359
No! No!

31:58.640 --> 31:59.759
(BEEPING)

31:59.840 --> 32:02.919
Inform high command. It is located.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.079
The Tardis is located.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.959
DALEK: The Tardis will be procured.

32:09.040 --> 32:11.919
Procure the Tardis. Procure the Tardis.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.679
Procure. Procure.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.519
Davros is the child of war.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.119
A war that wouldn't end,
a thousand years of fighting,

32:21.200 --> 32:22.559
till nobody could remember why.

32:23.680 --> 32:26.839
So, Davros, he created
a new kind of warrior,

32:26.920 --> 32:29.119
one that wouldn't bother
with that question.

32:29.960 --> 32:33.879
A mutant in a tank
that would never, ever stop.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.639
And they never did.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.519
The Daleks.

32:39.160 --> 32:41.039
How scared must you be,

32:42.960 --> 32:46.679
to seal every one of your own kind
inside a tank?

32:48.440 --> 32:49.759
(BEEPING)

32:52.520 --> 32:54.439
Davros made the Daleks.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.599
But who made Davros?

33:00.880 --> 33:03.159
OK, great. Coming out of hyperspace.

33:07.480 --> 33:08.879
So that's where he ended up.

33:09.840 --> 33:10.999
CLARA: What is that?

33:11.080 --> 33:12.279
DOCTOR: I don't know.

33:12.920 --> 33:13.919
A hospital?

33:15.480 --> 33:17.319
(MISSY SINGING)

33:26.880 --> 33:28.999
How long have we been waiting?

33:29.480 --> 33:30.479
Who knows?

33:31.040 --> 33:32.599
It's always the way with hospitals.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.319
You will come.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.599
You will stay.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.079
Fair enough.

33:44.680 --> 33:45.759
Doctor.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.719
You sent Missy your confession dial.

33:51.840 --> 33:54.199
Well, we've known
each other a long time.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.559
She's one of my own people.

33:55.640 --> 33:58.359
My point is, we both saw her
die on Earth, ages ago.

33:58.440 --> 34:01.759
And obviously you knew that wasn't real,
or worse, hoped it wasn't.

34:02.600 --> 34:06.199
Either way, I think you've been lying.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.319
I'm sorry.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.799
Don't apologise. Make it up to me.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.079
There, see, ha!

34:17.080 --> 34:18.399
Now you have to come back.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.039
(HISSING)

34:29.000 --> 34:30.239
Gravity.

34:30.920 --> 34:31.999
I know.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.439
-Gravity?
-Oh, yeah.

34:46.280 --> 34:47.559
You know what's wrong
with the gravity in here?

34:48.360 --> 34:49.679
-No.
-Nothing.

34:51.640 --> 34:52.759
It's perfect.

34:53.120 --> 34:56.119
But this is a space station,
so the gravity should be

34:56.200 --> 34:59.559
artificial, all coppery-smelling
round the edges,

35:00.000 --> 35:01.479
a tiny bit sexy.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.479
But, this feels real, man.

35:05.640 --> 35:06.679
Like a planet.

35:06.760 --> 35:09.079
How can you and the Doctor be friends?

35:09.160 --> 35:11.279
-Why shouldn't we be?
-You spend all your time fighting.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.079
-Exactly.
-(HISSING)

35:14.800 --> 35:16.799

35:17.160 --> 35:18.239
I'll tell you.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.959
-It's pants.
-What do you mean?

35:21.040 --> 35:24.799
I mean that today might be the day.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.279
What day?

35:26.520 --> 35:27.879
The day I kill you.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.879
What are you doing? Are you opening it?

35:29.960 --> 35:30.959
MISSY: Yeah, of course.

35:31.720 --> 35:33.199
Missy, we'll get sucked out!

35:33.280 --> 35:34.839
You and me together, off we go!

36:27.600 --> 36:31.919
DAVROS: I approve of your new face,
Doctor.

36:33.200 --> 36:35.799
So much more like mine.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.879
You came, then?

36:52.520 --> 36:53.519
Clearly.

36:54.200 --> 36:56.199
Did you suspect a trap?

36:57.520 --> 36:58.879
I still do.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.519
Then why are you here?

37:03.960 --> 37:06.639
Did you miss our conversations?

a virus in your laboratory...

But did you bother to tell anyone

37:21.200 --> 37:22.639
they might be eating
their own relatives?

37:22.720 --> 37:24.519
Yes, yes, OK,
you've made your point.

37:24.600 --> 37:25.919
Have I?

37:26.720 --> 37:28.639
If someone who knew the future

37:28.720 --> 37:31.559
pointed out a child to you
and told you that that child

37:31.640 --> 37:33.319
would grow up totally evil,

37:33.400 --> 37:36.679
to be a ruthless dictator
who would destroy millions of lives,

37:36.880 --> 37:38.479
could you then kill that child?

37:38.720 --> 37:40.519
I get the point.

37:40.600 --> 37:43.719
Do you know why you came, Doctor?

37:44.840 --> 37:47.319
You have a sense of duty.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.599
Of guilt, perhaps.

37:49.080 --> 37:52.319
And certainly of shame.

37:53.960 --> 37:55.039
You flatter me.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.759
A pity.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.839
I intended to accuse.

38:03.720 --> 38:07.599
I believe that
for the ultimate good of the universe

38:07.680 --> 38:10.679
I was right to create the Daleks.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.879
You were very wrong.

38:12.960 --> 38:16.039
DAVROS: This is the argument
we've had since we met.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.639
It ended in the Time War.

38:17.720 --> 38:20.079
It survived the Time War,

38:20.240 --> 38:24.079
but it will end tonight.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.919
That is why you are here.

It's warm, isn't it?

39:02.760 --> 39:04.119
Oh, there's a floor?

39:04.200 --> 39:05.199
MISSY: No.

39:05.680 --> 39:07.199
No, there's ground.

39:08.200 --> 39:09.679
This is the ground.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.279
We're on a planet!

39:17.000 --> 39:19.759
And that is not a space station,

39:19.840 --> 39:21.719
that is a building,

39:21.800 --> 39:26.319
and the rest of the planet,
the whole thing, is invisible.

39:26.400 --> 39:27.759
That's ridiculous.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.159
MISSY: Well, yes, of course it is.

39:29.240 --> 39:30.919
I mean, how would you
ever find your glasses,

39:31.000 --> 39:32.719
or the little girls' room and...

39:32.800 --> 39:34.399
What if you kissed an ugly?

39:35.680 --> 39:37.999
Unless, when you're part of
the atmosphere,

39:40.840 --> 39:42.839
you start syncing with the spectrum.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.599
Why would anybody hide a whole planet?

39:47.760 --> 39:49.679
That would rather depend
on the planet, dear.

39:56.120 --> 39:59.079
No!

39:59.920 --> 40:01.559
They've built it again.
They've brought it back.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.159
No! No! No!

40:03.360 --> 40:05.639
What? What is it? Where are we?

40:06.680 --> 40:07.719
Skaro!

40:08.720 --> 40:10.559
You brought me to Skaro!

but with his children?

40:15.960 --> 40:17.199

MISSY: The beginning.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.519
Where it all started.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.999
This is the planet of the Daleks.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.039
DALEK: Correct!

40:31.560 --> 40:32.559
Clara!

40:34.840 --> 40:37.439
You cannot help her now, Doctor.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.119

40:52.920 --> 40:54.239
CLARA: The Tardis.

40:54.880 --> 40:56.039
How did she get here?

40:56.120 --> 40:58.839
It has been procured.

41:02.840 --> 41:06.519
Yeah? Yeah, well, if you're
trying to get inside, you can't.

41:06.880 --> 41:08.359
Nothing can enter the Tardis.

41:08.880 --> 41:12.199
The Tardis will not be entered.

41:12.280 --> 41:15.479
The Tardis will be destroyed.

41:15.560 --> 41:18.439
(LAUGHS) Well, good luck,
because she's indestructible.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.519
Did the Doctor tell you that?

41:19.600 --> 41:21.679
'Cause you should never
believe a man about a vehicle.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.199
What are they going to do?

41:23.280 --> 41:24.479
Who can say?

41:24.560 --> 41:26.679
You know what children are like.

41:26.800 --> 41:30.039

41:30.840 --> 41:33.439
Don't. Just don't.

41:33.640 --> 41:35.039
You know what this is?

41:35.440 --> 41:37.679
This thing you're about to destroy?

41:38.040 --> 41:39.519
I'll tell you.

41:40.040 --> 41:43.199
It's the dog's unmentionables.

41:43.520 --> 41:46.199
And you know all about those, don't you?

41:47.160 --> 41:48.799
This is a Tardis.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.719
Now, with this you can
go anywhere, do anything,

41:51.800 --> 41:52.919
kill anyone.

41:53.000 --> 41:57.479
With this, the Daleks
can be more powerful than ever before.

42:00.920 --> 42:02.879
You just need one thing.

42:03.600 --> 42:05.319
No. Missy, no!

42:05.680 --> 42:06.679
Me!

42:07.680 --> 42:09.079
You need me!

42:09.840 --> 42:12.359
A Time Lady to show you how it works.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.879
With this and with me,

42:14.960 --> 42:16.719
everything can be yours,

42:16.800 --> 42:21.479
and you can burn it all,
forever and ever and ever.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.039
Or would you rather just kill me?

42:33.400 --> 42:35.839
Maximum extermination.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.119
Exterminate!

42:41.280 --> 42:42.279
Please!

42:42.360 --> 42:43.559

42:43.880 --> 42:45.319
Please, I'm begging you, please!

42:45.600 --> 42:47.639
Please. Please save Clara.

42:47.720 --> 42:49.879
I gave the Daleks life.

42:49.960 --> 42:52.239
I do not control them.

42:58.680 --> 42:59.839
Oh, Clara.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.239
Oh, my Clara.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.839
See how they play with her.

43:04.920 --> 43:07.399
See how they toy! They want her to run.

43:07.480 --> 43:09.479
They need her to run.

43:09.560 --> 43:12.119
Do you feel their need, Doctor?

43:12.720 --> 43:15.039
Their blood is screaming.

43:15.120 --> 43:17.759
Kill! Kill! Kill!

43:17.840 --> 43:20.159
Hunter and prey,

43:20.240 --> 43:23.999
held in the ecstasy of crisis.

43:24.440 --> 43:28.439
Is this not life at its purest?

43:44.520 --> 43:46.519
Exterminate! Exterminate!

43:46.880 --> 43:47.879
(SCREAMS)

43:54.520 --> 43:55.719
(SIGHS)

44:00.800 --> 44:02.999
Why have I ever let you live?

44:03.920 --> 44:06.039
Compassion, Doctor.

44:06.680 --> 44:10.759
It has always been
your greatest indulgence.

44:11.280 --> 44:14.679
Let this be my final victory.

44:14.760 --> 44:18.879
Let me hear you say it, just once.

44:19.760 --> 44:24.799
Compassion is wrong.

44:27.160 --> 44:29.119
Destroy the Tardis!

44:29.200 --> 44:31.359
DALEKS: Destroy! Destroy!

44:36.200 --> 44:42.799
Destroy! Destroy!

44:51.760 --> 44:52.999
YOUNG DAVROS: Help me!

44:57.120 --> 44:59.439
You can't leave me, you promised.

44:59.840 --> 45:01.639
You said I had a chance.

45:01.720 --> 45:03.039
(CLICKING)

45:05.280 --> 45:06.439
Who are you?

45:08.440 --> 45:09.679
I don't get it.

45:10.880 --> 45:11.959
How did you get there?

45:12.440 --> 45:13.679
From the future.

45:15.040 --> 45:16.439
Are you going to save me?

45:17.080 --> 45:19.119
I'm going to save my friend,

45:19.600 --> 45:20.879
the only way I can.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.039
Exterminate!

45:52.760 --> 45:56.279
DAVROS: Imagine to hold in your hand

45:56.360 --> 45:58.599
the heartbeat of every Dalek.

46:01.200 --> 46:03.759
Genocide, in a moment.

46:05.800 --> 46:09.319
So many backs with a single knife.

46:09.680 --> 46:11.719
DALEKS: Always Davros!

46:12.600 --> 46:15.319
Are you ready to be a god?
