STUDIO TIME WITH MY DAD.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.207
LOOK, IF YOU WIN, YOU
GOT TO GIVE HER ALL THAT
MONEY BACK, ALL RIGHT?

00:07.207 --> 00:10.344
THINGS HAVE BEEN KIND OF
DIFFERENT WITH YOU LATELY.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.479
LOOK, I NEED TO GO.
I WANT TO BE

00:12.479 --> 00:14.114

DAMN IT, SPENCER.
JUST GET OUT OF

00:18.085 --> 00:19.653
MICAH: YOU KNOW,
I TRIED CALLING

00:19.653 --> 00:21.555
AND TEXTING,
I MEAN, A FEW TIMES,

00:21.555 --> 00:22.856
BUT I NEVER
HEARD BACK.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.424
MY LIFE GOT
A LITTLE COMPLICATED.

00:24.424 --> 00:25.792
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE
JUST TOLD ME THAT

00:25.792 --> 00:27.127
INSTEAD OF GHOSTING ME,
RIGHT?

00:27.127 --> 00:28.629
IT'S OK. LOOK, UM,

00:28.629 --> 00:29.763
I'M GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE DOING WELL.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.365
TAKE CARE.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.166
SPENCER: I'M CHOOSING YOU TO
BE MY FATHER, NOT MY COACH.

00:33.166 --> 00:34.534
I--I JUST WANT TO BE
YOUR SON.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.436
AND I DON'T WANT FOOTBALL
GETTING IN THE WAY OF THAT.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.116

02:29.116 --> 02:31.084
WHERE DID THE TIME GO?

02:31.084 --> 02:32.386
DON'T ASK ME.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.221
I'M STILL TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT

SPENCER AND DILLON ARE
COMING WITH ME TO
THE BARBECUE.

02:42.362 --> 02:44.097
NO. I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE NIGHT THING.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.133
AIN'T THERE GONNA
BE A DJ, DRINKS?

02:46.133 --> 02:47.601
YEAH.

02:47.601 --> 02:48.535
DANCING?

02:48.535 --> 02:50.303
PROBABLY.

02:50.303 --> 02:52.272
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU
CANNOT BE THE SINGLE LADY

02:52.272 --> 02:53.774

THIRSTY.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.509
UH, I'M NOT GONNA
LOOK THIRSTY.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.177
YEAH, IF YOU BRING SOMEONE.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.413
WHAT'S UP WITH MICAH?
HIT THAT BOY UP.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.081
I AIN'T SEEN HIM

OH, MICAH

03:02.783 --> 03:04.084

03:04.084 --> 03:06.520
COOP: YO, WHO
CANCELED YOU, BRO?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.455
CHERIE.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.290
FOR THE RECORD, MICAH
DID NOT CANCEL ME.

03:10.290 --> 03:13.160
HE JUST MOVED ON.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.096
WITH WHO?

03:16.096 --> 03:17.531
I DIDN'T ASK.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.099
HOW YOU EVEN KNOW
IT'S THAT SERIOUS?

03:19.099 --> 03:21.401

03:34.010 --> 03:35.980
YOU EVER WONDER WHAT WE'RE
GONNA BE IN 25 YEARS?

03:35.980 --> 03:37.810
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M
GOING TO BE DOING TOMORROW.

03:37.810 --> 03:39.680
HEH! YOU'RE STILL
COMING, RIGHT?

03:39.680 --> 03:41.450
TO THE REUNION BARBECUE?

03:41.450 --> 03:43.480

03:43.480 --> 03:45.450
YEAH, BUT MY POPS

03:45.450 --> 03:47.620

COME ON. WE GONNA BE LATE.

03:52.460 --> 03:54.430

04:03.470 --> 04:05.410
LAYLA, I GOT TO ASK
YOU SOMETHING.

04:05.410 --> 04:07.310
YEAH?

04:08.710 --> 04:10.480
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TODAY?

04:10.480 --> 04:12.780
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE
I'LL GO SEE A PSYCHIC

04:12.780 --> 04:14.450
AND SEE WHERE I'LL BE
IN 25 YEARS.

04:14.450 --> 04:16.050
ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU
WANT SOME COMPANY?

04:16.050 --> 04:17.820
DON'T NEED A BABYSITTER.

04:17.820 --> 04:20.350
I KNOW. YOU'RE
NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO
COULD USE A DAY OFF.

04:20.350 --> 04:21.920
JUST NO PSYCHICS,
THOUGH, PLEASE.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.420
COOL.

04:23.420 --> 04:24.930
JORDAN: PLEASE?
LAURA: NO!

04:24.930 --> 04:26.490
MA?

04:26.490 --> 04:27.730
I ALREADY GAVE YOU
YOUR PHONE BACK, JORDAN.

04:27.730 --> 04:29.660
I AM NOT GIVING YOU
YOUR CAR KEYS.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.930
OK, FINE. CAN I
AT LEAST USE THE ACCOUNT
TO ORDER A RIDE?

04:31.930 --> 04:34.670
LOOK, I HAVE--I HAVE
A THING TOMORROW NIGHT.

04:34.670 --> 04:36.500
DOES THIS THING HAVE
A NAME?

04:36.500 --> 04:37.810
IT'S NOT A DATE.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.540
WHAT PART OF "GROUNDED"
IS CONFUSING?

04:40.540 --> 04:42.410
LOOK, CARA DOESN'T
HAVE A CAR, ALL RIGHT?

04:42.410 --> 04:43.910

04:43.910 --> 04:46.450
AM I NOT ALLOWED TO HELP
OUT A FRIEND IN NEED?

04:46.450 --> 04:47.820
I'M SORRY, JORDAN.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.550
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW
HARD IT IS TO BE YOU
RIGHT NOW.

04:50.550 --> 04:52.450
THANK YOU.

04:52.450 --> 04:55.490
SO WAS THAT A YES?

04:55.490 --> 04:57.790
NOPE. STOP ASKING.

05:03.830 --> 05:05.800
WHAT, YOU GOT SOMETHING
WITTY TO SAY?

05:05.800 --> 05:10.040
YES, I DO, BUT I'M
GOING TO KEEP IT
TO MYSELF.

05:10.040 --> 05:13.370
AND I ALSO HAVE
A SOLUTION TO YOUR
COMPLICATED DATING LIFE.

05:13.370 --> 05:15.010
I'M LISTENING.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.780
GO WITH ME TO DAD'S
REUNION BARBECUE TOMORROW.

05:17.780 --> 05:19.380
WON'T GRACE JAMES
BE THERE?

05:19.380 --> 05:20.780
THE WHOLE DAY
WILL JUST BE

05:20.780 --> 05:22.480
A HUGE REMINDER
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.950
MY CAR TOMORROW NIGHT.

05:25.950 --> 05:29.360
JUST GO TO THE REUNION
AND HANG OUT WITH DAD.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.520
YOU'RE BRIBING ME.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.760
YES.

05:33.460 --> 05:36.360
YEAH. I'LL BE THERE.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.370
GOOD MORNING, ASHER.

05:40.370 --> 05:43.370
HEY, DAD.

05:43.370 --> 05:44.740
YOU LOOK GOOD.

05:44.740 --> 05:45.810
I FEEL GOOD.

05:49.510 --> 05:50.710
GOT SOME BIG NEWS.

05:50.710 --> 05:52.980
-YEAH?
-NOPE. NEVER MIND.

05:52.980 --> 05:55.380
I DON'T WANT TO JINX IT.

05:55.380 --> 05:57.720
BUT IF EVERYTHING
WORKS OUT,

05:57.720 --> 05:59.850
IT'S GONNA BE BIG NEWS
FOR BOTH OF US.

05:59.850 --> 06:01.050
THAT'S GREAT.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.830
I, UH, BETTER GET
TO SCHOOL.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.730
WHO WAS ON THE PHONE?

06:11.630 --> 06:12.700
MOM.

06:14.470 --> 06:16.440
I WAS SURPRISED TO
HEAR FROM HER.

06:16.440 --> 06:19.370
IT'S BEEN, LIKE, A YEAR.

06:19.370 --> 06:20.770
SHE ASKED TO MEET
FOR LUNCH TOMORROW.

06:20.770 --> 06:22.740
SAID SHE HAD SOMETHING
IMPORTANT SHE

06:22.740 --> 06:24.910
WANTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT.

06:24.910 --> 06:27.310
WELL, I GUESS EVERYONE
HAS BIG NEWS.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.360
LAYLA: THAT MOVIE SUCKED.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.430
THEY NEED TO JUST
STOP REMAKING REMAKES.

06:39.430 --> 06:41.900
DO YOU HAVE ANY SNACKS?

06:41.900 --> 06:44.430
UH, WE PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T STAY LONG.

06:44.430 --> 06:46.430
ISN'T YOUR MOM AT WORK?

06:46.430 --> 06:48.740
YEAH, BUT IF
SHE COMES HOME EARLY
AND CATCHES US SKIPPING...

06:48.740 --> 06:52.540
THE FUN OF SKIPPING
IS THE DANGER OF
GETTING CAUGHT.

06:52.540 --> 06:55.110
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.780
I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

06:56.780 --> 06:58.650
OK.

06:58.650 --> 07:01.380
LAYLA, I SEEN
THE CUTS ON YOUR ARM.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.450
WAIT. WHAT?

07:03.450 --> 07:05.050
LAYLA, IF YOU
HURTING YOURSELF--

07:05.050 --> 07:06.550
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

07:06.550 --> 07:08.390
THAT'S WHY YOU
SKIPPED, SO YOU
COULD AMBUSH ME.

07:08.390 --> 07:10.020
-I JUST THOUGHT--
-NO.

07:10.020 --> 07:12.690
MAYBE DON'T THINK
SO MUCH, SPENCER.

07:12.690 --> 07:14.390
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU.
I'M OUT.

07:14.390 --> 07:16.000
AND I'M NOT GOING TO
YOUR BARBECUE THING.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.660
LAYLA, WAIT. WHAT--

07:17.660 --> 07:19.570
NO. JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THESE CUTS ARE FROM
MY BRACELETS.

07:19.570 --> 07:21.940
OK, OK, I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE JUMPED
TO CONCLUSIONS.

07:21.940 --> 07:23.770
I GUESS I'M JUST STILL
GETTING USED TO THIS
NEW VERSION OF YOU.

07:23.770 --> 07:26.440
IT'S NOT A VERSION
OF ME. IT'S ME.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.110
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE
MORE WORRIED

07:28.110 --> 07:29.840
ABOUT THIS VERSION OF YOU.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.320
SO YOU
BELIEVE HER?

07:38.320 --> 07:39.720
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO BELIEVE.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.420
WELL, I DID HEAR
SOMEBODY SAY THAT

07:41.420 --> 07:43.530
THEM RODEO DRIVE
BRACELETS IS

07:43.530 --> 07:45.190
WAY MORE DANGEROUS
THAT WHAT WE GOT OVER
HERE AT CRENSHAW.

07:45.190 --> 07:46.590
LOOK, I AIN'T SAYING
SHE LYING,

07:46.590 --> 07:48.260
BUT EVEN IF SHE NOT
CUTTING HERSELF,

07:48.260 --> 07:50.300
SHE'S STILL ACTING LIKE
NOTHING MATTERS.

07:50.300 --> 07:53.230
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S
JUST SOME BEVERLY HILLS
EMO PHASE.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.110
MAYBE I SHOULD CALL HER POPS.

07:59.070 --> 08:01.040
YOU DON'T THINK I SHOULD.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.140
TAKE IT FROM SOMEBODY
WHO EVERYONE THINKS
IS A SNITCH.

08:03.140 --> 08:05.080
AND SAY YOU DO
MAKE THE CALL

08:05.080 --> 08:06.380
AND THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG.

08:06.380 --> 08:08.120
LAYLA IS NEVER GONNA
FORGIVE YOU.

08:08.120 --> 08:11.220
-AND I COULD LOSE HER.
-YEAH.

08:11.220 --> 08:12.720
SO MAYBE YOU CAN
HANG OUT WITH HER.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.120
MAN, WHAT? COME ON.
DON'T PUT ME IN THAT--

08:15.120 --> 08:16.660
YOU TRYING TO
WRITE SONGS, RIGHT?

08:16.660 --> 08:18.560
THAT'S SOMETHING SHE LOVES.
MAYBE SHE CAN HELP YOU.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.200
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
I HIT HER UP.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.600
BUT I'M NOT SPYING
ON YOUR GIRL, DOG.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.070
I HEARD THAT.

08:31.770 --> 08:34.080
COREY JAMES, IS THAT YOU?

08:34.080 --> 08:36.280
DENISE RIVERS?

08:36.280 --> 08:38.110
IT'S DENISE PATTERSON NOW.

08:38.110 --> 08:40.180
BUT DON'T YOU WORRY.
I'M SINGLE.

08:40.180 --> 08:42.120
-OK.
-HERE'S YOUR BADGE.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.320
-ALL RIGHT.
-OH. OH.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.690

THE STATE TITLE?

08:48.190 --> 08:49.420
I'M GONNA TRY.

08:49.420 --> 08:53.190

BILLY BAKER.

08:53.190 --> 08:54.430
HOW IS THAT BOY
LOOKING FINER

08:54.430 --> 08:56.060
THAN HE DID
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL?

08:56.060 --> 08:57.300
HOW DO I LOOK?

08:57.300 --> 08:59.700
-COREY.
-BILLY.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.070

09:01.070 --> 09:02.670
DENISE RIVERS.

09:02.670 --> 09:06.510
OH, PATTERSON.
IT'S OK. SHE'S SINGLE.

09:06.510 --> 09:08.080
-HEY, BILLY B.
-HEY, NOW.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.440
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.480
HA HA!

09:10.480 --> 09:12.450
IT'S GONNA GO
OFF TONIGHT.

09:12.450 --> 09:14.420
WAIT. WHAT'S
HAPPENING HERE?

09:14.420 --> 09:16.120
ISN'T THAT GREG BANKS
OVER THERE?

09:16.120 --> 09:17.550
I HEARD HE'S SINGLE.

09:17.550 --> 09:19.120
GREG BANKS,

-OK.

09:25.430 --> 09:29.100
BILLY: HA! I OWE YOU
FOR THAT. CRAZY.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.300

09:30.300 --> 09:33.170
OH, THIS SEEMS TO BE
OUR SPOT, HUH? REMEMBER?

09:33.170 --> 09:35.570
I REMEMBER. A LOT OF
HISTORY HERE.

09:35.570 --> 09:40.040
SO, COR, UH, ABOUT
SPENCER WANTING TO
STAY AT BEVERLY.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.980
IT WAS HIS DECISION.
HE MADE IT.

09:50.820 --> 09:53.690
YO, BILLY, EVERY TIME
WE RUN THAT
COUNTER REVERSE PLAY,

09:53.690 --> 09:55.190
YOU GET THE BALL.

09:55.190 --> 09:56.830
THAT'S BECAUSE I'M
FASTER THAN YOU, COREY.

10:06.270 --> 10:07.840
COREY: DANG, BILLY.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.400
WHO IS THAT?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.570
I HEARD HER
NAME'S GRACE.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.270
COREY: HUH.

10:13.270 --> 10:16.410
GRACE: HEY.
BILLY: HEY.

10:16.410 --> 10:19.150
GRACE: WHERE Y'ALL GET
THOSE NAME TAGS?

10:19.150 --> 10:22.080
YOU GOT TO CHECK IN
WITH DENISE.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.120
-RIVERS?
-IT'S PATTERSON NOW.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.820
-AND SHE'S SINGLE.
-SHE GOT HER EYE ON BILLY.

10:26.820 --> 10:28.790
YEAH. SHE ALWAYS DID.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.590
-FELLAS.
-YO.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.260
-MR. BAKER.
-ALL RIGHT.

10:33.260 --> 10:34.530
DILLON: IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

10:34.530 --> 10:35.830
SPENCER: CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

10:35.830 --> 10:37.100
YOU GONNA
BE GOOD?

10:37.100 --> 10:38.430
YEAH.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.400
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU,
LITTLE MAN?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.170
I GOT CANCELED
BY A GIRL.

10:42.170 --> 10:45.770
FOR REAL? YEAH.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.180
ME, TOO.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.810
WHAT'S UP, SON?

10:49.810 --> 10:52.110
NOTHING MUCH. I WAS
JUST THINKING MAYBE WE
SHOULD MAKE SOME PLANS.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.210
I'M STAYING IN BEVERLY

10:53.210 --> 10:54.520
SO THAT WE CAN FOCUS
ON US AS A FAMILY.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.150
GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

10:56.150 --> 10:57.650
JUST TELL ME WHEN AND WHERE.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.220
I WAS HOPING YOU'D
HAVE SOME IDEAS.

10:59.220 --> 11:02.090
WE CAN GO FISHING.

11:02.090 --> 11:04.090
FISHING.

11:04.090 --> 11:06.790
HA HA! I WAS THINKING
MAYBE HIT UP
A LAKERS GAME OR...

11:06.790 --> 11:09.100
I'M A CLIPPERS FAN, SON.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.170
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.500
CLIPPERS ALL DAY.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.140
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS
FAMILY THING GONNA
WORK OUT.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.640
NAH.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.070
GETTING TO KNOW EACH
OTHER ALREADY, RIGHT?

11:18.070 --> 11:19.070
YEAH! YEAH! OK.

11:19.070 --> 11:22.080
GRACE?

11:22.080 --> 11:23.240
HI...

11:23.240 --> 11:24.110
DENISE.

11:24.110 --> 11:25.180
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.

11:25.180 --> 11:26.650
YEAH. SO DO YOU.

11:26.650 --> 11:28.620
OH, GIRL, YEAH, I KNOW
I STILL GOT IT.

11:29.580 --> 11:31.220
LISTEN, I'M JUST
GONNA SAY IT.

11:31.220 --> 11:32.820
WE'RE BOTH SINGLE,
WE'RE BOTH LOOKING.

11:32.820 --> 11:34.260
I AM NOT LOOKING.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.260
THERE'S GOING TO BE
PLENTY OF FISH IN THE SEA.

11:36.260 --> 11:39.560
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST
LET EACH OTHER KNOW WHO
WE HAVE OUR EYES ON

11:39.560 --> 11:41.500
AND THEN WE DON'T STEP
ON EACH OTHER'S TOES.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.130
YOU KNOW, I'M--I'M
BRINGING A DATE.

11:44.130 --> 11:46.170
OK! YOU GOT A LITTLE
BOYFRIEND.

11:46.170 --> 11:47.570
MM-HMM. SORT OF.
YEAH.

11:47.570 --> 11:49.170
WHO?

11:49.170 --> 11:50.440
I MEAN, YUP.
I DON'T KNOW.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.440
LOOK, UH, CAN YOU--
CAN I, UM--

11:52.440 --> 11:54.240
CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME
MY BADGE?

11:54.240 --> 11:57.150
OH. ALL RIGHT.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.810
YEAH. THANKS.

11:58.810 --> 12:01.080
LIV, ALL I'M SAYING IS
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU GOT YOUR CAR WASHED?

12:01.080 --> 12:02.580
MY CAR'S NOT DIRTY,

12:02.580 --> 12:05.250
AND YOU'RE LUCKY TO
HAVE A CAR AT ALL.
MOVE.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.120
LOOK, I'M MAKING A SACRIFICE,
TOO, ALL RIGHT?

12:07.120 --> 12:08.590
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO BE HERE.

12:08.590 --> 12:11.060
JORDAN, I KNOW HOW
YOU FEEL. I DO.

12:11.060 --> 12:13.330
BUT DAD IS ALL ALONE
RIGHT NOW,
AND HE NEEDS US.

12:13.330 --> 12:15.060
SO COULD YOU PLEASE
JUST, LIKE, PRETEND LIKE

12:15.060 --> 12:16.330
YOU'RE HAPPY TO SEE HIM?

12:16.330 --> 12:18.530
WAIT. HERE HE COMES.
SMILE.

12:18.530 --> 12:21.240
HEY. YOU GUYS CAME.
I DIDN'T THINK THAT
YOU'D, UH...

12:21.240 --> 12:23.340
WE WOULDN'T MISS IT,
RIGHT, JORDAN?

12:23.340 --> 12:24.640
MM.

12:24.640 --> 12:28.140
WELL, I'M, UH, I'M
GLAD YOU GUYS SHOWED UP.

12:28.140 --> 12:29.480
UH, COME.
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU

12:29.480 --> 12:31.610
TO A COUPLE OF MY OLD
TEAMMATES. COOL?

12:31.610 --> 12:33.180
COME ON. COME ON.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.620
-UH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
-ALL RIGHT. COOL.

12:39.290 --> 12:41.790
HEY. I THOUGHT YOU
WERE BRINGING LAYLA.

12:41.790 --> 12:46.090
YEAH. ME, TOO.
KIND OF HAD
A FIGHT.

12:46.090 --> 12:47.860
I ASKED A QUESTION,
AND SHE LEFT.

12:47.860 --> 12:50.830
WHAT DID YOU ASK HER?

12:50.830 --> 12:53.170
I SEEN SOME CUTS
ON HER ARM.

12:53.170 --> 12:55.340
THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE
HURTING HERSELF.

12:55.340 --> 12:57.210
I'M JUST WORRIED
ABOUT HER.

12:57.210 --> 13:00.070
SPENCER, THERE
WAS NEVER A SECOND
BREAK-IN AT HER HOUSE.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.080
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:02.080 --> 13:03.650
LAYLA TRASHED HER OWN HOUSE,

13:03.650 --> 13:07.220
AND I'VE SEEN DEPRESSION,
AND THERE ARE DEFINITELY
SIGNS THERE.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.180
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SHE'S GOING THROUGH,

13:10.180 --> 13:12.690
BUT SOMETHING'S NOT
RIGHT WITH HER.

13:17.090 --> 13:19.330
THIS IS REALLY GOOD, COOP.

13:19.330 --> 13:21.660
YEAH. BUT IT'S
INCOMPLETE.

13:21.660 --> 13:23.100
OK. SO FINISH IT.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.230
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

13:25.230 --> 13:27.070
LIKE, EVERYTHING COMES
OUT SO NATURAL,
AND THEN I GET STUCK.

13:27.070 --> 13:28.740
AND THE REST JUST
SEEMS FORCED.

13:28.740 --> 13:30.410
OK. SO JUST WALK AWAY.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.210
I CAN'T JUST KEEP
STARTING OVER ON SONGS.

13:32.210 --> 13:34.140
NO. LITERALLY,
LIKE, WALK AWAY.

13:34.140 --> 13:36.610
TAKE A--TAKE A LONG WALK
AND CLEAR YOUR HEAD.

13:36.610 --> 13:38.350
ANYWAY...

13:38.350 --> 13:40.210
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

13:40.210 --> 13:43.120
I'M GOOD. HA HA.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.390
I'M REALLY GOOD,
ACTUALLY.

13:44.390 --> 13:46.850
I'M JUST EMBRACING
THE NEW ME.

13:46.850 --> 13:49.260
I GET IT. YOU KNOW,
JUST KEEPING IT REAL.

13:55.460 --> 13:58.270
SPENCER CALLING FOR
A FULL REPORT?

13:58.270 --> 13:59.730
NAH. THAT'S--THAT'S
NOT IT.

13:59.730 --> 14:03.140
UM, I ASKED YOU HERE
BECAUSE I'M STUCK.

14:03.140 --> 14:07.640
AND I COULD REALLY USE
YOUR HELP. THAT'S ALL.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.190
YOU HIDING FROM
DENISE RIVERS?

14:20.190 --> 14:24.160
HEH. IT'S PATTERSON NOW.

14:24.160 --> 14:27.430
I JUST WANTED TO
SAY THANK YOU.

14:27.430 --> 14:28.660
FOR WHAT?

14:28.660 --> 14:30.300
SPENCER SEEMS REALLY
HAPPY WITH THE WAY

14:30.300 --> 14:32.170
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
IS GOING.

14:32.170 --> 14:35.070
YOU MENTIONED
CLIPPER TICKETS?

14:35.070 --> 14:36.600
HA HA.

14:38.070 --> 14:39.410
YOU OK, COREY?

14:39.410 --> 14:43.110
YEAH. I'M GOOD.
SOMETHING CAME UP.

14:43.110 --> 14:45.280
I GOT TO GET OUT OF
HERE EARLY.

14:45.280 --> 14:48.420
OK. YOU STILL COMING
TO THE DANCE, THOUGH,
TONIGHT, RIGHT?

14:48.420 --> 14:51.620
I'LL BE THERE.
SAVE ME A DANCE.

15:00.030 --> 15:03.130
OLIVIA: HEY. SORRY I'M LATE.
ARCHER: HEY.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.200
WHY AM I SO NERVOUS?

15:06.200 --> 15:07.670
IT'S BEEN A YEAR.

15:07.670 --> 15:10.340
I'M SURE SHE'S JUST
AS NERVOUS AS YOU.

15:22.050 --> 15:23.520
HEY, BABY.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.550
MOM.

15:32.260 --> 15:34.130
YOU REMEMBER OLIVIA?

15:34.130 --> 15:37.370
YES. UH, JORDAN'S
SISTER, RIGHT?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.270
WAIT. ARE YOU TWO...?

15:39.270 --> 15:41.140
-NO.
-NO.

15:41.140 --> 15:44.210
OH. WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.
YOU LOOK CUTE TOGETHER.

15:44.210 --> 15:48.210
PLEASE SIT. SIT.

15:48.210 --> 15:50.140
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

15:50.140 --> 15:51.210
ABOUT WHAT?

15:51.210 --> 15:53.180
WELL, YOUR LIFE.

15:53.180 --> 15:55.120
YOU WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT MY LIFE?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.250
MAYBE I SHOULD--

15:56.250 --> 15:58.620
NO, NO, NO.
I WANT YOU TO STAY.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.060
IT'S BEEN A YEAR, MOM.

16:04.060 --> 16:06.290
GWEN: I KNOW.

16:06.290 --> 16:09.230
SO WHY NOW?
WHAT CHANGED?

16:09.230 --> 16:12.230
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU.

16:12.230 --> 16:15.700
BUT JUST KNOW THAT I HAVE
MISSED YOU EVERY DAY.

16:17.470 --> 16:20.810
ASHER SAID THAT YOU
HAVE SOME NEWS.

16:20.810 --> 16:23.540
YES. AHEM.

16:23.540 --> 16:27.220
UM, JACOB, MY BOYFRIEND,
PROPOSED.

16:27.220 --> 16:31.220
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

16:36.030 --> 16:37.790
WOW. THAT'S
A BEAUTIFUL RING, GWEN.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.700
THANK YOU, OLIVIA.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.830
ASHER?

16:41.830 --> 16:43.030
WHAT?

16:43.030 --> 16:44.600
AREN'T YOU GONNA SAY
ANYTHING?

16:44.600 --> 16:45.900
ABOUT THE RING?

16:45.900 --> 16:48.940
ABOUT THE ENGAGEMENT--
ME AND JACOB.

16:48.940 --> 16:50.770
MOM, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW JACOB.

16:50.770 --> 16:54.910
I KNOW. BUT THAT'S
GOING TO CHANGE.

16:54.910 --> 16:57.310
ARE WE DONE HERE?

16:57.310 --> 16:59.610
-ASHER--
-LOOK, MOM...

16:59.610 --> 17:02.680
YOU WANTED TO TELL ME
YOUR BIG NEWS,
AND NOW I KNOW.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.550
LOOK, THAT'S NOT THE REASON
WHY I ASKED YOU HERE.

17:04.550 --> 17:08.960
I CAN'T MARRY JACOB
UNTIL YOUR FATHER AND I
ARE OFFICIALLY DIVORCED.

17:08.960 --> 17:12.160
AND HAROLD KEEPS AVOIDING
THE DIVORCE PAPERS.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.000
I'VE TRIED TO SERVE HIM
8 TIMES, BUT--

17:14.000 --> 17:15.800
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU ASKING
HIM TO DO?

17:15.800 --> 17:18.930
WELL, I'M HOPING...

17:21.170 --> 17:24.640
THAT YOU'LL SERVE HAROLD
WITH THESE DIVORCE PAPERS.

17:26.670 --> 17:31.680
GWEN: FINALIZING THIS IS
THE BEST THING FOR EVERYBODY,

17:31.680 --> 17:34.080
INCLUDING YOUR FATHER.

17:35.620 --> 17:39.950
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

17:39.950 --> 17:41.560
OK?

17:44.930 --> 17:46.860
I LOVE YOU, BABY.

17:53.770 --> 17:56.740
YOU FEEL OLD YET?

17:56.740 --> 17:57.970
DO I LOOK OLD?

17:57.970 --> 17:59.540
NOT AS OLD AS SOME
OF YOUR CLASSMATES.

17:59.540 --> 18:01.280
THAT'S MY BOY.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.810
-HEY, BILLY B.
-HEY, NOW.

18:02.810 --> 18:04.550
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT,
RIGHT?

18:04.550 --> 18:06.650
-SHE'S THIRSTY.
-YEAH.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.880
DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T TELL MOM.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.250
TELL MOM WHAT?

18:11.250 --> 18:13.860
-AH, HA HA.
-HA HA!

18:13.860 --> 18:15.720
YOU GOT JOKES.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.460
AHH. I MISS THIS, MAN.
YOU AND ME.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.730
AND I KNOW. I KNOW.
I KNOW.

18:22.730 --> 18:23.930
WE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO,

18:23.930 --> 18:26.670
BUT, UH,
BUT WE'LL GET THERE.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.300
CAN I GIVE YOU A RIDE?

18:28.300 --> 18:31.240
UH, NO. I GOT, UH,
I GOT LIV'S CAR.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.140
DOES YOUR MOTHER KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

18:33.140 --> 18:36.780
NO. UM, ARE YOU
GONNA TELL HER?

18:36.780 --> 18:38.750
-JORDAN.
-COME ON, DAD.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.020
WE'VE BEEN HAVING
A GOOD TIME TODAY,
RIGHT?

18:41.020 --> 18:44.650
GIVE ME A BREAK
ON THIS ONE, PLEASE?

18:44.650 --> 18:47.320
ANY DISTRACTION IS GOOD
WHEN YOU'RE STUCK.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.720
THE KEY IS YOU
JUST CAN'T FORCE IT.

18:49.720 --> 18:53.260
SO NOW JUST SEE WHAT WORDS
POP INTO YOUR HEAD.

18:53.260 --> 18:56.730
OK. I WILL
GIVE THAT A TRY.

18:56.730 --> 18:59.300
OK. UM, I'M GONNA
GET GOING.

18:59.300 --> 19:02.600
OK. HEY, TODAY WAS COOL.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.010
I APPRECIATE YOU
COMING THROUGH.

19:05.010 --> 19:06.710
YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.980
THAT'S, LIKE, YOUR
TENTH MISSED CALL, COOP.

19:12.980 --> 19:15.650
SO WHAT?
I'M POPULAR TODAY.

19:15.650 --> 19:18.090
I KNOW IT'S SPENCER.

19:18.090 --> 19:21.020
LOOK, HE CARES ABOUT YOU.

19:21.020 --> 19:23.220
OK. SO HE SET THIS
WHOLE THING UP?

19:23.220 --> 19:25.090
NO. I HONESTLY JUST
THINK HE'S WORRIED.

19:25.090 --> 19:28.000
-WHAT'S UP, LADIES?
-GO AWAY.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.800
YO, DEUCE, THIS
IS BAD TIMING.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.270
I AIN'T GOING
NOWHERE TILL LITTLE
MISS BEVERLY HILLS HERE

19:32.270 --> 19:34.300
GIVES ME THAT STUDIO TIME
WITH J.P. KEATING.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.100
WHAT DID YOU JUST
CALL ME?

19:36.100 --> 19:38.070
YOU OWE ME,
AND I'MMA GET MINE.
BELIEVE THAT.

19:38.070 --> 19:39.840
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

19:39.840 --> 19:41.680
YOU THINK MY DAD IS
GONNA WASTE HIS TIME

19:41.680 --> 19:43.240
WITH SOME WEAK-ASS,
NEEDY M.C.?

19:43.240 --> 19:45.210
-HEY, LAYLA, CHILL.
-NOW YOU DISRESPECTING ME.

19:45.210 --> 19:46.650
LAYLA: WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT

19:46.650 --> 19:50.720
OR GET UP OUT
OF MY FACE, HMM?

19:50.720 --> 19:52.850
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.490
ALL TALK.

19:59.090 --> 20:01.230
ALL RIGHT.

20:01.230 --> 20:04.130
YOU ALL GO BACK DOING
WHAT Y'ALL WAS DOING.
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.010
-MICAH, HI.
-HEY.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.620
THANKS
FOR COMING.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.750
UH, YOUR MESSAGE SAID
IT WAS URGENT.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.620
BUT I'M GUESSING YOU
DON'T NEED HELP WITH
AN ASSIGNMENT.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.720
YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST
GRADE IN THE CLASS.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.220
I DO?

20:28.220 --> 20:30.790
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD YOU THAT.

20:30.790 --> 20:31.830
HA HA!

20:31.830 --> 20:34.300
UH, WHAT DO YOU NEED?

20:34.300 --> 20:37.800
A FAVOR. WOULD
YOU MIND IF WE SIT?

20:37.800 --> 20:39.230
AM I IN TROUBLE?

20:39.230 --> 20:40.640
-NO, YOU'RE FINE.
-HA HA! ALL RIGHT.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.600
YOU'RE FINE.

20:44.670 --> 20:46.070
WHAT'S THE FAVOR?

20:46.070 --> 20:50.040
UM, MY 25-YEAR REUNION
IS TONIGHT.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.080
OH. AND, UH,
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE

20:53.080 --> 20:54.680
THE SINGLE LADY AT
THE PARTY LOOKING THIRSTY.

20:54.680 --> 20:57.650
I AM NOT GONNA BE
LOOKING THIRSTY!

20:57.650 --> 21:00.660
HA HA! HEY, I'M JOKING.
I'M KIDDING, OK? HA HA!

21:00.660 --> 21:03.220
NO. HEY, LOOK, IF YOU NEED
A DATE, YOU GOT ONE. COME ON.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.760
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS, RIGHT?

21:05.760 --> 21:08.730
RIGHT. FRIENDS.
HA HA.

21:13.030 --> 21:14.570
WHY CAN'T WE GO
TO YOUR HOUSE?

21:14.570 --> 21:16.670
MY MOM'S HOME.
WHAT ABOUT YOURS?

21:16.670 --> 21:21.180
SAME. WE COULD ALWAYS
JUST PULL OVER,
GET IN THE BACK SEAT.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.580
UM, IT'S
MY SISTER'S CAR.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.910
SO?

21:25.910 --> 21:27.780
WHO KEEPS BLOWING YOU UP?

21:27.780 --> 21:30.220
WHO THE HELL
IS SIMONE?

21:30.220 --> 21:32.150
NOBODY. GIVE ME--
GIVE ME MY PHONE.

21:32.150 --> 21:34.090
-NO.
-GIVE ME--GIVE ME MY PHONE.

21:34.090 --> 21:35.590
-WHY DON'T YOU MAKE ME?
-OH, SHOOT!

21:35.590 --> 21:37.930
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO!
OH, NO, NO, NO.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.630
CARA: WAIT. NO. AAH!

21:44.900 --> 21:47.770
YOU OK?

21:47.770 --> 21:49.970
YES. BETTER THAN YOUR
SISTER'S CAR.

21:49.970 --> 21:51.770
I'M SO DEAD.

21:51.770 --> 21:53.740
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET OUT OF HERE.

21:53.740 --> 21:55.640
YEAH, BUT WE CAN'T JUST
LEAVE MY SISTER'S CAR HERE.

21:57.850 --> 22:01.520
YOU CAN STAY.
SAY HI TO SIMONE.

22:12.090 --> 22:13.260
HEY.

22:13.260 --> 22:15.230
HEY. YOU HEARD FROM LAYLA?

22:15.230 --> 22:17.200
NO. I MEAN, I LEFT HER
A COUPLE MESSAGES.
WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:17.200 --> 22:19.170
SHE WAS HANGING OUT
WITH COOP TODAY
AND LOST IT ON SOME DUDE.

22:19.170 --> 22:20.970
LOST IT?

22:20.970 --> 22:22.940
JUST PICKING FIGHTS
SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN PICKING, ALL RIGHT?

22:22.940 --> 22:24.940
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE
SHE IS.

22:24.940 --> 22:27.210
I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA.
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

22:29.240 --> 22:32.110
MICAH: THIS WAS MY JAM
IN JUNIOR HIGH.

22:32.110 --> 22:34.880
HA HA! GREAT. THANKS.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.650
AS IF I DIDN'T FEEL OLD
ENOUGH ALREADY TODAY.

22:37.650 --> 22:40.790
DON'T WORRY.
YOU STILL GOT IT.

22:40.790 --> 22:42.660
OH, I KNOW I DO.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.060
MICAH: MY 20-YEAR
REUNION WAS LAST YEAR.

22:47.060 --> 22:48.930
AH, THEY'RE
ALL THE SAME.

22:48.930 --> 22:52.670
JUST, "HOW YOU BEEN?"
"WHAT YOU BEEN UP TO?"

22:52.670 --> 22:55.270
-GENERIC CONVERSATION.
-YEAH.

22:58.110 --> 22:59.340
HOW YOU BEEN?

23:01.140 --> 23:03.210
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

23:04.880 --> 23:08.620
SO THIS IS WHAT OUR
RELATIONSHIP HAS COME TO?

23:08.620 --> 23:11.650
MAYBE I SHOULD GET US,
UM, SOMETHING TO DRINK.

23:16.890 --> 23:19.830
BILLY: 25 YEARS.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

23:19.830 --> 23:22.200
MOST OF IT SEEMS
LIKE A LIFETIME AGO.

23:22.200 --> 23:26.800
AND THEN SOME THINGS
FEEL LIKE THEY
JUST HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.140
YOU MISS IT?

23:31.710 --> 23:34.110
SOME OF IT. YOU?

23:34.110 --> 23:36.340
YOU KNOW, THERE WERE
SOME GOOD MEMORIES,
BUT, UH--

23:36.340 --> 23:38.650
BUT THE BAD ONES
STAY WITH US.

23:39.810 --> 23:42.120
THINGS THAT NEED
TO BE SAID, BILLY.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.690
ASHER: HEY.

23:46.690 --> 23:47.860
HEY.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.630
ANY WORD ON
THAT BIG NEWS?

23:50.630 --> 23:55.900
NO. I WAS WAITING TO HEAR
ABOUT A JOB OFFER.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.930
SURE SOUNDED TO ME LIKE
I WAS GONNA GET IT.

23:57.930 --> 23:59.570
DON'T JINX IT, DAD.

23:59.570 --> 24:00.900
HA HA!

24:03.770 --> 24:06.040
WHAT WAS YOUR MOM'S
BIG NEWS?

24:10.810 --> 24:13.210
SHE'S MARRYING JACOB.

24:13.210 --> 24:15.580
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

24:15.580 --> 24:17.550
UNLUCKY GUESS.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.930
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, ASHER?

24:25.930 --> 24:30.200
I AM SERVING YOU WITH
THESE DIVORCE PAPERS.

24:31.670 --> 24:35.740
I'M SORRY.
SHE'S GONE, DAD.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.910
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO LET HER GO.

24:37.910 --> 24:40.640
ALL THAT MATTERS IS
THAT WE HAVE EACH OTHER

24:40.640 --> 24:44.050
AND WE'RE DOING OK,
RIGHT?

24:44.050 --> 24:47.620
I'LL ALWAYS BE HERE
FOR YOU.

24:47.620 --> 24:51.120
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

25:11.540 --> 25:13.270
WHEN DID YOU SNEAK IN?

25:13.270 --> 25:14.910
A WHILE AGO.

25:14.910 --> 25:19.250
JUST BEEN BUSY TAKING PHOTOS
OF BILLY WITH ALL HIS FANS.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.720
THEY DO LOVE HIM HERE.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.520
THAT MAN CASTS
A VERY BIG SHADOW.

25:24.520 --> 25:25.920
YOU'LL BE FINE.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.290
WIN A FEW GAMES.

25:32.430 --> 25:35.730
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
YOU, COREY?

25:35.730 --> 25:38.470
DENISE: HEY!

25:38.470 --> 25:41.340
WHERE ALL MY SINGLE FELLAS AT?

25:42.840 --> 25:46.870
DENISE: HEY, OK, I SEE YOU.
I SEE...YOU. HELLO! HA HA.

25:46.870 --> 25:51.450
OK. AS CLASS PRESIDENT,
THEY'VE ASKED ME TO MAKE

25:51.450 --> 25:52.850
A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT TONIGHT.

25:52.850 --> 25:55.620
WE ARE HONORING
A FORMER CLASSMATE

25:55.620 --> 25:58.850
WHO PUT SOUTH CRENSHAW HIGH
ON THE MAP, OK?

25:58.850 --> 26:00.290
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

26:00.290 --> 26:02.220
DENISE: WE ALL REMEMBER
HIS AMAZING MOTHER

26:02.220 --> 26:05.390
AS THE BEST HISTORY TEACHER
THIS SCHOOL HAS EVER SEEN,

26:05.390 --> 26:09.300
MRS. B? MRS. B, YOU KNOW!
HA HA!

26:10.500 --> 26:14.330
SO...SO TO GET HIM UP ON STAGE,

26:14.330 --> 26:18.670
WE HAVE A TRIBUTE TO HIS
AMAZING MAMA.

26:29.250 --> 26:30.850
DENISE: LET'S BRING UP
TO THE STAGE

26:30.850 --> 26:35.690
SOUTH CRENSHAW HIGH'S FAVORITE
SON AND ONLY NFL STAR,

26:35.690 --> 26:39.430
STILL LOOKING FINE AS EVER,
BILLY BAKER.

26:40.530 --> 26:42.530
DENISE: WHOO! GET UP HERE!

26:42.530 --> 26:47.270
ARE YOU GONNA SAY
SOMETHING? MOM? MOM?

26:47.270 --> 26:49.440
OK. YOU'RE STARTING
TO SCARE ME.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.800
GOOD. SIT.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.470
YOU MIND IF I STAND?

26:53.470 --> 26:55.440
YOU WILL SIT.
I WILL STAND.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.040
I WILL ASK
THE QUESTIONS,

26:57.040 --> 26:59.380
AND YOU WILL PROVIDE
THE ANSWERS.

26:59.380 --> 27:00.980
YOU WILL TELL ME
THE WHOLE TRUTH

27:00.980 --> 27:04.220
AND NOTHING
BUT THE TRUTH,
SO HELP YOU, GOD.

27:04.220 --> 27:05.420
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN COURT.

27:05.420 --> 27:07.290
YOU ARE IN MY COURT.

27:07.290 --> 27:11.390
DID I OR DID I NOT
SUSPEND YOUR
DRIVING PRIVILEGES?

27:11.390 --> 27:13.260
-MOM.
-ANSWER THE QUESTION.

27:13.260 --> 27:15.560
YES. OK. I WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO DRIVE.

27:15.560 --> 27:18.330
AND YET SOMEHOW,
YOU MANAGED TO CRASH

27:18.330 --> 27:22.370
YOUR SISTER'S CAR
INTO OUR NEIGHBOR'S
FRONT YARD.

27:22.370 --> 27:24.400
IS THAT A QUESTION?

27:24.400 --> 27:27.470
YOU ARE GROUNDED
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN
LEGALLY GROUND YOU FOR.

27:27.470 --> 27:30.540
AND YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY
NEXT WEEKEND, CANCELED.

27:30.540 --> 27:32.380
EVERYTHING IS CANCELED.

27:32.380 --> 27:34.650
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, MOM.
THAT'S LIV'S PARTY, TOO.

27:34.650 --> 27:37.320
YEAH? SHE GAVE YOU
THE KEYS TO HER CAR.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.550
YEAH. SHE HAD A GOOD REASON.

27:39.550 --> 27:42.320
OH, DID SHE? I'M
GLAD THAT SHE HAD
A GOOD REASON.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.730
WHEN DID YOU AND DAD
SWITCH PLACES?

27:48.360 --> 27:50.400
EXCUSE ME?

27:50.400 --> 27:53.530
NOTHING. IT'S JUST...

27:53.530 --> 27:55.440
YOU'RE THE BAD COP NOW,

27:55.440 --> 27:57.000
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE'S THE GOOD COP.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.710
WHEN WAS HE THE GOOD COP?

27:58.710 --> 28:01.270
TODAY. WE WENT
TO THE REUNION.

28:01.270 --> 28:05.650
YOUR DAD KNOWS
YOU'RE GROUNDED.

28:05.650 --> 28:09.380
DID HE KNOW THAT YOU WERE
DRIVING OLIVIA'S CAR?

28:09.380 --> 28:12.250
LOOK, MOM, DON'T--DON'T
BE MAD AT DAD, OK?

28:12.250 --> 28:16.620
HE WAS JUST BEING COOL
WITH ME BECAUSE WE WERE
GETTING ALONG, ALL RIGHT?

28:16.620 --> 28:18.390
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT. DON'T--

28:18.390 --> 28:20.690
DON'T--MOM.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.670
DENISE: WHILE WE STILL GOT
OUR GUY UP HERE,

28:28.670 --> 28:31.300
WE HAVE ONE MORE SPECIAL
TRIBUTE TO HIM.

28:31.300 --> 28:32.610
BILLY: OH, BOY.

28:32.910 --> 28:36.580
THE SCHOOL BOARD VOTED
UNANIMOUSLY, Y'ALL,

28:36.580 --> 28:41.280
TO RENAME OUR SOUTH CRENSHAW
FOOTBALL FIELD

28:41.280 --> 28:43.920
BILLY BAKER FIELD!

28:54.790 --> 28:56.200
SHE NOT HERE.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.230
I GOT THE KEY.

28:57.230 --> 28:59.200
THAT WORKED?

28:59.200 --> 29:01.270
YEAH. LIGHT-SKINNED GIRL
WITH STRAIGHT HAIR.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.170
WORKS EVERY TIME.

29:03.170 --> 29:04.840
SHOULD WE BE DOING THIS?

29:04.840 --> 29:07.540
PROBABLY NOT, BUT WE
CAN'T JUST SIT BACK
AND DO NOTHING.

29:28.130 --> 29:29.630
MY GOD.

29:29.630 --> 29:30.700
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

29:30.700 --> 29:33.970
I GOT TO CALL HER POPS.

29:36.340 --> 29:38.040
-YES, SIR. THANK YOU.
-WHAT'D HE SAY?

29:38.040 --> 29:39.980
LAYLA: WHAT DID WHO SAY?

29:44.610 --> 29:46.850
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY ROOM?

29:48.480 --> 29:50.120
WE WERE TRYING
TO REACH YOU.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.420
I WAS SHOPPING.

29:53.690 --> 29:55.890
AND HOW DARE YOU
INVADE MY PRIVACY.

29:55.890 --> 29:57.890
FIRST YOU PLAN MY WHOLE
DAY SO YOU CAN SPY ON ME.

29:57.890 --> 29:59.660
THAT'S NOT WHAT I
WAS DOING.

29:59.660 --> 30:01.600
AND THEN YOU BREAK INTO
MY ROOM BECAUSE WHAT,

30:01.600 --> 30:03.230
I DIDN'T RUN
MY SCHEDULE BY YOU?

30:03.230 --> 30:04.570
LAYLA--

30:04.570 --> 30:05.730
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
ELSE TO DO, ALL RIGHT?

30:05.730 --> 30:07.600
WHO DID YOU CALL?

30:07.600 --> 30:09.540
I CALLED YOUR POPS.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.940
IT'S OVER, SPENCER.

30:16.580 --> 30:18.580
-LAYLA, DON'T DO THIS.
-LAYLA, HE WAS JUST TRYING TO--

30:18.580 --> 30:20.580
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
REALLY WANT TO HEAR IT.
YOU CAN JUST GET OUT.

30:20.580 --> 30:22.850
-LAYLA?
-GET OUT!

30:44.170 --> 30:46.670
YOU KNOW, THERE WERE
SOME GOOD MEMORIES.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.680
THE BAD ONES
STAY WITH US.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.580
THINGS THAT NEED
TO BE SAID, BILLY.

30:54.050 --> 30:57.220
WHY WON'T YOU TALK
TO ME, BILLY?

30:57.220 --> 30:59.190
MAN. GET OUT OF MY FACE.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.120
YOUR POPS WON'T
TRAIN ME NO MORE?
I MEAN, WHAT'S WRONG?

31:01.120 --> 31:03.790
AM I STEALING
YOUR HEADLINES?
YOU GOT TO BE THE STAR?

31:03.790 --> 31:05.790
I AM THE STAR, COREY.

31:05.790 --> 31:08.500
AND YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THE JEALOUS SIDEKICK
WHO CAN NEVER BEAT ME.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.670
WHAT ABOUT GRACE?
WHO'D SHE CHOOSE?

31:11.670 --> 31:15.470
I CUT HER LOOSE,
SO YOU SHOULD BE
THANKING ME.

31:15.470 --> 31:18.210
WATCH YOURSELF, COREY,
OR I MIGHT CHANGE MY MIND

31:18.210 --> 31:20.510
AND TAKE HER BACK.

31:25.610 --> 31:27.550
BILLY: THINGS NEED
TO BE SAID.

31:29.480 --> 31:30.680
I'M LISTENING.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.820
BILLY BAKER FIELD?

31:32.820 --> 31:36.120
STILL JEALOUS
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

31:36.120 --> 31:38.890
I AIN'T NEVER BEEN
JEALOUS OF BILLY BAKER
IN MY LIFE.

31:38.890 --> 31:41.000
WELL, THEN GET OVER
IT, COREY.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.800
IT AIN'T MY FAULT
YOU QUIT FOOTBALL.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.060
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

31:44.060 --> 31:46.970
LOOK, I FOCUSED
ON THE NFL.

31:46.970 --> 31:48.670
YOU FOCUSED ON
YOUR MARRIAGE.

31:48.670 --> 31:50.540
A MARRIAGE YOU RUINED.

31:50.540 --> 31:53.910
BUT YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT.
YOU RUINED BOTH OF OUR
MARRIAGES, DIDN'T YOU?

31:55.210 --> 31:57.580
OH. HA HA!

31:57.580 --> 32:00.050
SAY IT AGAIN.

32:00.050 --> 32:01.720
WE REALLY GONNA DO THIS
ALL OVER AGAIN?

32:01.720 --> 32:03.480
-I'M RIGHT HERE.
-HA HA!

32:03.480 --> 32:05.450
I'M RIGHT HERE.

32:05.450 --> 32:06.920
-OH, MAN. MAN.
-I'M RIGHT HERE.

32:06.920 --> 32:11.760
YOU REALLY YOUR OWN
WORST ENEMY, BILLY. HEH.

32:18.130 --> 32:20.000
I DIDN'T QUIT.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.070
WHAT?

32:21.070 --> 32:24.770
I DIDN'T QUIT FOOTBALL.
I GOT SICK.

32:24.770 --> 32:28.610
HAD TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
TO BEAT IT, WHICH I DID.

32:28.610 --> 32:30.840
NO, I DIDN'T DO IT
FOR GRACE.

32:30.840 --> 32:33.810
AND WHEN I TRIED TO RETURN
TO FOOTBALL, IT WAS TOO LATE.

32:33.810 --> 32:36.150
I'D LOST THAT
SECOND GEAR.

32:36.150 --> 32:38.490
IT WAS ALL GONE.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.550
WH--WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

32:40.550 --> 32:43.560
YOU CUT ME OUT.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.130
I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHAT IT WAS.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.160
WAS IT GRACE?

32:48.160 --> 32:52.000
I'M SORRY FOR MOVING IN
ON HER IN HIGH SCHOOL.

32:58.640 --> 33:02.080
UH, AND I'M SORRY...

33:03.880 --> 33:06.150
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR MARRIAGE.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.650
I'M SORRY, COREY.

33:08.650 --> 33:12.090
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT
HAPPENED IN MY MARRIAGE.

33:14.860 --> 33:16.920
AND I DIDN'T CUT YOU
OUT BECAUSE OF GRACE.

33:16.920 --> 33:22.760
IT WAS JUST HOW I HAD
TO DEAL WITH THINGS.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.630
WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
MOM WAS DYING...

33:28.700 --> 33:32.570

TO CUT EVERYBODY OUT--

33:32.570 --> 33:36.610
YOU AND GRACE AND...

33:36.610 --> 33:38.150
