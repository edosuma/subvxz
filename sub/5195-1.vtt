WEBVTT

00:28.571 --> 00:31.658
(door opens)

00:31.825 --> 00:33.785
(door closes)

00:33.952 --> 00:36.788
(approaching footsteps)

00:41.876 --> 00:43.545
Mom?

00:46.089 --> 00:48.466
- Kat?

00:49.467 --> 00:52.846
Yeah. I'm fine.

00:54.264 --> 00:56.266
Why are you
all dressed up?

00:56.433 --> 00:58.351
What do you mean?

01:01.604 --> 01:03.022
What time is it?

01:03.189 --> 01:04.649
Almost five.

01:04.816 --> 01:06.151
Really?

01:08.069 --> 01:10.238
I need
to get dinner started.

01:18.788 --> 01:21.916
Kat: I was 17 when
my mother disappeared.

01:22.083 --> 01:26.129
Just as I was becoming nothing
but my body, flesh and blood,

01:26.296 --> 01:28.465
and raging hormones.

01:30.550 --> 01:33.052
She stepped out of hers
and left it behind.

01:34.429 --> 01:37.015
(ethereal rock music)

02:57.512 --> 02:59.931
(music continues faintly
on headphones)

03:00.098 --> 03:01.975
(knocking)

03:08.481 --> 03:10.817
Hi, Mrs. Hillman.
Ls Phil home?

03:10.984 --> 03:14.487
No. I'm sorry, Katrina.
He's... he's not back yet.

03:14.654 --> 03:16.030
Really?

03:17.532 --> 03:19.242
Supposed to pick
me up from school.

03:19.409 --> 03:22.871
I'm sure he's on his way.
You know how he is.

03:23.037 --> 03:26.457
Uh, w... w... would you like to
come in and... and wait for him?

03:26.624 --> 03:29.711
That's okay. Just tell him
that I stopped by.

03:29.878 --> 03:31.296
I will.

03:31.462 --> 03:32.630
Thanks, Mrs. Hillman.

03:32.797 --> 03:35.133
Oh, no problem, dear.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.352
(music continues)

04:08.041 --> 04:09.542
(music shuts off)

04:09.709 --> 04:10.793
Dad?

04:12.170 --> 04:14.172
What are you doing
home already?

04:16.925 --> 04:18.384
Have you seen your mother?

04:18.551 --> 04:20.595
No, why?

04:23.306 --> 04:24.933
She's gone.

04:25.099 --> 04:28.102
What do you mean
she's gone?

04:28.269 --> 04:30.521
I came home
and she wasn't here.

04:30.688 --> 04:33.775
She's probably
at the store or something.

04:35.401 --> 04:37.195
Her car is in the garage.

04:37.362 --> 04:41.324
Oh my God, stop being so
melodramatic. She'll turn up.

04:41.491 --> 04:45.370
I called everyone.
Nobody's seen her.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.665
Dad, don't worry.
I'm sure everything's fine.

04:50.792 --> 04:52.085
Yeah.

04:54.045 --> 04:56.047
I'm going to my room.

05:00.176 --> 05:02.971
Yeah, it was weird. She didn't
leave a note or anything.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.181
And dad is totally
freaking out.

05:05.348 --> 05:08.184
- (video game noises)
- Where do you think she is?

05:08.351 --> 05:10.061
Maybe she finally left him.

05:10.228 --> 05:13.314
She's been threatening to
for all these years.

05:13.481 --> 05:17.318
Well, was she, like,
acting weird or something?

05:17.485 --> 05:19.195
No weirder than usual.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.614
Actually, no. Last week
I came home from school

05:21.781 --> 05:24.158
and I found her sleeping
in my bed.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.660
What?

05:25.827 --> 05:28.204
Yeah. Random, Right?

05:28.371 --> 05:30.039
When she woke up,
she seemed like,

05:30.206 --> 05:31.666
all confused and out of it.

05:31.833 --> 05:33.668
Kat: I think she was still
half in a dream.

05:33.835 --> 05:36.045
(video game noise continues)

05:36.212 --> 05:39.549
So, anyways, where the hell
were you today?

05:39.716 --> 05:42.093
Oh, yeah.

05:42.260 --> 05:44.679
Sorry, I... I was hanging out
at Thomas', and...

05:44.846 --> 05:47.140
Kat: And you were stoned.

05:47.306 --> 05:51.519
(laughs) Uh, maybe.

05:51.686 --> 05:54.105
You want me to come over?

05:54.272 --> 05:56.592
Phil: I don't know, I kind of have
a lot of homework to do.

05:56.691 --> 05:58.609
Since when do you give
a shit about homework?

05:58.776 --> 06:01.487
My mom's been on my case
lately about my grades.

06:01.654 --> 06:04.949
Phil, we haven't had sex in,
like, over a week.

06:06.159 --> 06:07.660
I miss fucking you.

06:07.827 --> 06:12.040
Same here, babe.
But, you know what they say.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.251
Absence makes
the heart get stronger.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.214
Yeah.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.174
(knocking)

06:21.340 --> 06:22.820
Mrs. Hillman: Phil, are you in there?

06:22.925 --> 06:24.093
I'm on the phone.

06:24.260 --> 06:26.179
Mrs. Hillman: Could you come
out here for a minute, honey?

06:26.345 --> 06:28.765
I heard a strange
noise outside.

06:28.931 --> 06:31.809
You're always hearing
strange noises.

06:31.976 --> 06:34.228
Yeah, I'll be out
in a sec.

06:34.395 --> 06:38.483
I gotta go. My crazy mom
is imagining things again.

06:38.649 --> 06:42.779
Hmm-kay.
Talk to you later.

06:42.945 --> 06:45.031
Okay.

06:49.494 --> 06:51.287
(insects chirping)

06:57.543 --> 06:59.045
So, no word?

07:39.710 --> 07:41.921
You think we should
call the police?

07:45.591 --> 07:47.885
(sighs) I don't want them
coming here

07:48.052 --> 07:49.428
for all the neighbors to see.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.556
Your mother
wouldn't like it.

08:01.732 --> 08:05.611
If we don't hear
anything by morning,

08:05.778 --> 08:08.239
let's take a drive
down to the station.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.085
Mom?

08:21.252 --> 08:24.172
(ethereal music)

08:30.094 --> 08:31.554
Mom?

08:52.617 --> 08:54.285
Mom?

08:56.204 --> 08:57.663
Mom, what happened?

09:04.045 --> 09:06.422
(gasps)

09:14.096 --> 09:16.057
Kat: When I was little,
my mother tried...

09:16.224 --> 09:18.017
to curl my hair.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.774
Oh, well. We tried.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.569
It looks a little fuller,
I suppose.

09:28.736 --> 09:31.530
Kat: She named me Katrina so
that she could call me Kat,

09:31.697 --> 09:34.367
because she always
wanted a pet.

09:34.533 --> 09:39.580
Come here, Kat. Purr for me,
kitty. Come on. Purr.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.124
Purr. Purr. Purr.

09:42.291 --> 09:47.213
(laughs) That's it.
Good, good little kitty.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.340
Kat: For years
I thought I was her pet.

09:49.507 --> 09:52.718
(giggles)

09:55.596 --> 09:57.807
(giggles)

10:03.271 --> 10:07.358
Kat? Kat?

10:11.445 --> 10:13.155
Mama?

10:17.952 --> 10:21.998
I'm here, Kat. I'm here.

10:32.383 --> 10:37.888
No more for you. God, you're
getting fatter by the hour.

10:38.055 --> 10:40.516
Kat: My mother always wanted me
to be a sylph,

10:40.683 --> 10:42.518
all lithe and elegant like her.

10:42.685 --> 10:46.731
And when I hit puberty, my body
changed seemingly overnight,

10:46.897 --> 10:49.942
the bulk melting off like
I was a snowman in the sun.

10:50.109 --> 10:52.278
Only, instead of finally
pleasing her,

10:52.445 --> 10:54.822
that somehow made her
resent me even more.

10:54.989 --> 10:58.951
- Do you love the boy?
- God, Jesus, you scared me.

10:59.118 --> 11:01.829
How long have you been
standing there?

11:01.996 --> 11:04.498
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

11:07.335 --> 11:09.253
Well, are you going
to answer my question?

11:09.420 --> 11:10.420
What question?

11:10.463 --> 11:13.674
That boy next door.
Do you love him?

11:13.841 --> 11:16.844
What are you talking about?
It's none of your business.

11:20.431 --> 11:22.808
I don't love your father.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.977
I can't stand him,
as a matter of fact.

11:25.144 --> 11:27.271
What the fuck? Why would
you say that to me?

11:27.438 --> 11:29.315
Go fuckin'
tell it to someone else.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.486
(door slam)

11:34.403 --> 11:36.489
<i>(sighs)</i>

11:36.655 --> 11:37.740
Man: So no note, huh?

11:40.659 --> 11:42.787
No. Nothing.

11:45.581 --> 11:48.334
You say she
didn't pack a bag.

11:48.501 --> 11:52.671
Well, nothing seems to be
missing as far as I can tell.

11:59.345 --> 12:01.347
Kat: The detective was the
polar opposite of men

12:01.514 --> 12:03.516
like my father, and Phil.

12:03.682 --> 12:06.560
He was the kind of man who
carried a gun, got into fights,

12:06.727 --> 12:10.064
killed things
with his bare hands.

12:10.231 --> 12:11.482
Was she depressed?

12:11.649 --> 12:14.610
Was she on any kind of medication,
or taking anything?

12:14.777 --> 12:16.195
She didn't kill herself,

12:16.362 --> 12:18.906
if that's what you're
trying to imply.

12:23.911 --> 12:27.039
(sighs) Well,
the good news is that,

12:27.206 --> 12:30.376
there's no matches at any of
the hospitals or morgue.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.296
No evidence of foul play.

12:34.463 --> 12:37.675
However, and I hate to be
the one to tell you this,

12:37.842 --> 12:42.138
hundreds of wives
go missing every week.

12:42.304 --> 12:45.683
If a woman wants to vanish,
buddy, she can.

12:45.850 --> 12:48.060
Are you saying there's
nothing we can do?

12:48.227 --> 12:49.812
Oh, sure there is.

12:49.979 --> 12:51.981
I recommend you alert
your friends, your neighbors.

12:52.148 --> 12:54.692
Detective: Tell them to be
on the lookout.

12:54.859 --> 12:57.570
Keep an eye on your bank
account, your credit cards,

12:57.736 --> 12:59.488
for any kind of activity.

12:59.655 --> 13:00.698
Got an answering machine?

13:00.865 --> 13:02.741
Mm-hm.

13:02.908 --> 13:06.287
Good, keep it on. Your wife
might try to contact you.

13:06.454 --> 13:10.958
Feel free to call me
if anything comes up.

13:24.889 --> 13:28.058
(airplane)

13:39.862 --> 13:41.405
Dad?

13:44.325 --> 13:46.368
Your mother never loved me.

13:50.331 --> 13:52.458
Kat: I didn't know what to say,
because I couldn't remember

13:52.625 --> 13:56.128
my mother ever looking at my dad
with anything but contempt.

13:56.295 --> 13:57.880
Maybe a zillion eons ago

13:58.047 --> 14:00.966
when they were young,
it was different.

14:01.133 --> 14:07.806
(ethereal music)

14:07.973 --> 14:10.059
It's perfect, right?

14:12.269 --> 14:14.438
It's everything
I've ever wanted.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.815
Kat: She was tall,
stunning,

14:16.982 --> 14:18.943
like a movie star.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.862
They were the
quintessential American couple,

14:22.029 --> 14:26.784
the future unfurling before
them like some endless magic carpet.

14:26.951 --> 14:28.869
If homemaking was an art
or science,

14:29.036 --> 14:31.789
my mother would
have won a Nobel Prize.

14:31.956 --> 14:33.707
But once the house
is immaculate,

14:33.874 --> 14:35.834
and everything was in its place,

14:36.001 --> 14:37.169
she had nothing left to do

14:37.336 --> 14:40.005
but plan the emptiness
of days to come.

14:40.172 --> 14:43.884
And gradually, the beautiful
woman she once was

14:44.051 --> 14:48.889
became no more than a phantom,
wandering away in a snowstorm.

14:51.392 --> 14:53.269
Hello, sweetheart.
What's for dinner?

14:53.435 --> 14:55.521
- Meatloaf.
- Oh, yum.

14:55.688 --> 14:58.482
Your meatloaf
is the cat's meow.

14:58.649 --> 15:00.401
So anyway, Do you remember
that ticket

15:00.568 --> 15:01.902
I bought at the office raffle?

15:02.069 --> 15:04.947
- Not really.
- Well, guess what? I won.

15:05.114 --> 15:08.576
- It's a crock pot.
- We don't need a crock pot.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.035
What are you talking about?

15:10.202 --> 15:11.870
These are the latest thing.
Everyone's getting one.

15:12.037 --> 15:16.083
You can make, uh, stews,
pot roast, chili.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.168
Well, I don't have time
to fuss with it now.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.588
I have to finish dinner.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.966
Just put it out of the way. Over
there, on top of the fridge.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.678
Kat: He was her doormat.

15:27.845 --> 15:31.223
She treated him like shit
and he let her.

15:31.390 --> 15:33.559
So imagine my shock
when I visited my father

15:33.726 --> 15:37.021
at work one day
and discovered he had game.

15:37.187 --> 15:38.814
Every woman there was into him.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.150
Flirting with him, batting
their eyelashes.

15:41.317 --> 15:45.446
Good morning, Mr. Connors.
And who is this pretty young lady?

15:45.613 --> 15:48.157
Good morning, Mindy. This is
Kat, the new receptionist.

15:48.324 --> 15:51.160
- (laughs)
- Kat: I was stunned.

15:51.327 --> 15:54.997
These women actually
thought my dad was hot.

15:55.164 --> 15:57.958
But to my mother,
he would always be pathetic.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.753
A constant reminder
of the unbearable repetition

16:00.919 --> 16:04.590
and dullness of her life.

16:04.757 --> 16:07.051
My parents' marriage was like
a long drink of water

16:07.217 --> 16:08.761
from a frozen fountain.

16:08.927 --> 16:12.139
So cold it turns your teeth
to diamonds.

16:12.306 --> 16:14.767
It was hardly a surprise
to learn their sex life sucked.

16:17.603 --> 16:22.566
Meanwhile, My father had
his own drawer of secrets.

16:28.197 --> 16:30.157
So they just went on
like that.

16:30.324 --> 16:33.994
My mom never coming, my dad
jacking off in the basement,

16:34.161 --> 16:37.122
all the while pretending
everything was fine.

16:37.289 --> 16:38.749
That we were the perfect
family

16:38.916 --> 16:41.377
living this perfect fucking life.

16:58.894 --> 17:01.063
Pass the butter.

17:09.154 --> 17:11.699
Thank you.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.076
Kat: There were times when
I thought she was going mad,

17:14.242 --> 17:15.868
that she was going
to suffocate my father

17:16.036 --> 17:17.204
one night with a pillow,

17:17.371 --> 17:20.415
that she was going to burn
the fucking house down.

17:20.582 --> 17:23.794
But instead, she vanished.

17:23.961 --> 17:27.005
Woman: How does that
make you feel?

17:27.172 --> 17:28.549
I don't know.

17:28.716 --> 17:31.009
You don't know?

17:31.176 --> 17:35.347
- Do you miss her?
- No. Not really.

17:35.514 --> 17:37.514
Kat: My dad made me see
a shrink because he thought

17:37.599 --> 17:40.352
I needed to process my feelings
about my mother leaving.

17:40.519 --> 17:44.273
Thing is,
I didn't have any feelings.

17:44.440 --> 17:47.234
Dr. Thaler reminds me of an
actress playing a therapist.

17:47.401 --> 17:51.113
And when we have a session, I
feel like an actress playing myself.

17:51.280 --> 17:55.576
I, I act... I have been having
kind of weird dreams lately.

17:55.743 --> 17:59.788
Kat: A bad actress.
Doing a shitty job.

17:59.955 --> 18:05.002
Like, I'm, um, I'm driving
through this gnarly snow storm

18:05.169 --> 18:07.629
and I can't see anything,
I mean, there's snow everywhere.

18:07.796 --> 18:10.549
And then out of nowhere,
this figure appears.

18:10.716 --> 18:13.510
I can't, like, make it out
in any detail or anything,

18:13.677 --> 18:16.597
but I just somehow know
that it's my mother.

18:16.764 --> 18:19.933
And I try to swerve, but I can
feel the car hit something.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.727
I get out,
and I look all around

18:21.894 --> 18:24.605
but there's no body, nothing.

18:24.772 --> 18:29.818
Just snow and blinding
whiteness everywhere.

18:29.985 --> 18:32.738
I... I've been having these
dreams ever since my mom left.

18:32.905 --> 18:34.156
That's not unusual,

18:34.323 --> 18:37.910
especially given the trauma
of your situation.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.120
However,
contrary to popular belief,

18:40.287 --> 18:43.207
dreams don't necessarily
mean anything.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.959
We all have strange dreams.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.212
But in most cases,
it's just your brain's way

18:48.378 --> 18:50.839
of letting off steam
at the end of the day.

18:52.049 --> 18:53.467
Oh.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.305
Phil: I'm worried
about you, Kat.

18:58.472 --> 19:00.682
What do you mean?

19:00.849 --> 19:03.894
This is too much
to deal with on your own.

19:04.061 --> 19:06.271
Is that shrink
you're seeing helping any?

19:06.438 --> 19:09.483
I guess. I've only been
a couple of times.

19:10.943 --> 19:12.778
Yeah, well, my mom said

19:12.945 --> 19:15.197
therapy helped her a lot
after my dad left.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.998
I still don't understand
how she could do this to you.

19:25.165 --> 19:29.461
- She wanted out, I guess.
- So? That's no excuse.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.966
Least my dad told us
he was leaving.

19:34.132 --> 19:39.304
He didn't just leave us
in the dark, wondering.

19:39.471 --> 19:45.102
Whatever. Can we just
stop talking and fuck?

19:45.269 --> 19:48.355
Gotta get back
before my mom freaks out.

19:48.522 --> 19:50.691
Plus isn't your dad
coming home soon?

19:50.858 --> 19:53.026
No, not for
at least an hour.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.779
Yeah, well, last thing I want
is for him to catch us again.

19:55.946 --> 19:59.408
Last time he got so mad I
thought he was gonna kill me.

19:59.575 --> 20:01.159
(both sigh)

20:01.326 --> 20:04.454
Just, give your shrink
a chance, will you?

20:04.621 --> 20:06.206
All right.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.710
Seriously. You need to
let some of your anger out.

20:09.877 --> 20:13.755
You're gonna crack.
Just like your mom.

20:13.922 --> 20:16.592
It's like a vicious circus.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.221
Catch you later.

20:25.017 --> 20:27.644
(rock music playing)

20:27.811 --> 20:29.104
I don't mean to sound crass,

20:29.271 --> 20:32.482
but if I don't get some dick
soon I'm going to explode.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.818
Join the fucking club,
sister.

20:34.985 --> 20:37.529
Look on the bright side.
At least you've had real sex.

20:37.696 --> 20:38.947
I'm so paranoid about AIDS

20:39.114 --> 20:41.450
I have to live vicariously
through you.

20:41.617 --> 20:43.857
Okay, well, the problem is that
once you've had real sex,

20:43.952 --> 20:46.496
it's, like, all
you can ever think about.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.040
And Phil barely
even touches me anymore.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.542
He, like, gives me
goodnight peck and that's it.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.336
What? That's fucked up.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.463
I know. It's, like,
we're some old married couple.

20:54.630 --> 20:57.299
Maybe you should bang that hot
detective you're so into.

20:57.466 --> 21:00.594
What? What are you talking
about? He's, like, 40.

21:00.761 --> 21:02.387
That's not even legal
I don't think.

21:02.554 --> 21:04.890
Kat, he's a cop. If anyone knows
how to do shit

21:05.057 --> 21:06.850
without getting caught, he does.

21:07.017 --> 21:09.561
Yeah, plus you'll be 18
in a few weeks anyway.

21:09.728 --> 21:13.732
Okay, whatever. (Laughs) I am
not screwing a 40 year old cop.

21:13.899 --> 21:16.401
Okay? (Laughs) Back
to the problem at hand,

21:16.568 --> 21:17.653
getting Phil to fuck me.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.738
Well, have you talked
to him about it?

21:19.905 --> 21:24.743
I tried. All he says is that,
uh, he's got a lot on his mind,

21:24.910 --> 21:27.621
and that I need
to cut him some slacks.

21:27.788 --> 21:30.540
Oh my God,
what a fucking moron!

21:30.707 --> 21:34.086
I know. I know Phil's not the
brightest crayon in the box.

21:34.252 --> 21:37.255
That is the understatement
of the century.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.633
That's what I kind of like
about him, you know?

21:39.800 --> 21:43.178
It's just simple.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.465
I know that sounds perverse,

21:44.471 --> 21:46.390
but he's kind of like my dad
in that way.

21:46.556 --> 21:50.352
You can scratch the surface
and there's just more surface.

21:50.519 --> 21:53.146
(laughs)

21:53.313 --> 21:55.857
I'm gonna get straight Cs!

21:58.193 --> 21:59.987
Show me.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.827
My God,
you're so fuckin' crazy!

22:06.994 --> 22:09.746
(horn honks)

22:09.913 --> 22:13.125
Kat: Phil is literally
the boy next door.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.544
And when he and his
mother moved in last year,

22:15.711 --> 22:18.088
I instantly despised him.

22:18.255 --> 22:20.465
He was so dull
and stupid.

22:20.632 --> 22:25.762
I made fun of him. Even earned
a special nickname: Garbage.

22:27.597 --> 22:32.019
But then, one night that
summer, everything changed.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.813
(Goth music plays)

22:37.566 --> 22:38.859
Me, Beth and Mickey,

22:39.026 --> 22:41.319
We were doing what we did
every Wednesday.

22:41.486 --> 22:43.280
And even more bored
than usual.

22:43.447 --> 22:46.199
Sometimes I wish someone would
burn this place to the ground

22:46.366 --> 22:47.993
so we didn't have
to come here anymore.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.327
Oh, tell me about it.

22:49.494 --> 22:51.371
Every week it's the same
fucking people

22:51.538 --> 22:52.914
with the same fucking songs

22:53.081 --> 22:55.250
in the exact same
fucking order.

22:57.252 --> 23:00.464
- Oh my God.
- What?

23:00.630 --> 23:02.758
Look what the bats
dragged in.

23:04.009 --> 23:06.595
Beth: What the hell
is Garbage doing here?

23:06.762 --> 23:08.638
Mickey: Oh, shit,
he's coming over here.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.265
Beth:
What a fucking freak.

23:10.432 --> 23:13.018
Guys, be cool. Come on.

23:17.439 --> 23:20.984
<i>. HEY-
. HEY-</i>

23:23.028 --> 23:25.155
You live across
the street from me.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.115
Mm-hm.

23:27.282 --> 23:28.282
I'm Phil.

23:28.283 --> 23:30.952
I'm Kat.

23:32.245 --> 23:35.582
This is, uh,
Beth and Mickey.

23:35.749 --> 23:37.042
Hey.

23:40.462 --> 23:43.507
This place seems cool.

23:43.673 --> 23:44.841
Mm-hm.

23:47.094 --> 23:49.137
You come here a lot?

23:49.304 --> 23:50.972
Sometimes.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.852
(new song plays)

24:00.232 --> 24:02.818
Is this your
first time here?

24:04.486 --> 24:06.154
Uh-huh.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.327
I love this song.

24:14.329 --> 24:16.123
Me too.

24:21.586 --> 24:23.672
Hey, do you wanna dance?

24:26.258 --> 24:27.759
Sure.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.636
(music continues)

25:11.803 --> 25:14.806
(screaming
and machine gun fire)

25:27.819 --> 25:30.447
(school bell rings)

25:41.041 --> 25:42.481
Wait, what if
your parents come home?

25:42.500 --> 25:44.878
It's my mom's shopping day
and my dad's at work.

25:45.045 --> 25:46.963
(giggles)

26:01.269 --> 26:02.854
You sure?

26:05.065 --> 26:06.066
Yeah.

26:15.242 --> 26:18.078
Ow. (Giggles) Sorry. Oops.

26:18.245 --> 26:19.663
Okay.

26:28.213 --> 26:29.589
You okay?

26:29.756 --> 26:32.592
Yeah. Okay. (Panting)

26:32.759 --> 26:34.594
(moaning) Oh, God.

26:34.761 --> 26:40.475
Kat: And like that, in a blink,
my virginity disappeared.

26:40.642 --> 26:43.103
Just like my mother.

26:43.270 --> 26:45.146
(knocking)

26:45.313 --> 26:48.692
Mrs. Hillman:
Hold on. I'm coming.

26:57.534 --> 26:59.286
Good afternoon, Mrs. Hillman.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.162
It's Eve Connors,
from next door.

27:01.329 --> 27:04.874
Oh. Hello.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.793
Do you have a moment?
May I come in?

27:06.960 --> 27:10.755
Yes, of... of course.
Ls... is everything all right?

27:10.922 --> 27:11.965
Everything's fine.

27:12.132 --> 27:15.552
I just thought we should
have a little chat.

27:15.719 --> 27:19.931
Oh, please, sit.

27:20.098 --> 27:25.103
Can I get you a cup of tea,
or coffee, Mrs. Connors?

27:25.270 --> 27:27.188
No, no thank you.

27:27.355 --> 27:29.524
And please, call me Eve.

27:31.234 --> 27:33.570
So...

27:33.737 --> 27:37.157
what can I help
you with, Eve?

27:37.324 --> 27:39.951
Well, it seems my daughter Kat
and your son are dating.

27:40.118 --> 27:45.332
Yeah, I know. They're going to
some big fancy dance next week.

27:45.498 --> 27:48.376
- Fall formal.
- Ah, the... that's... that's it.

27:48.543 --> 27:51.171
Phil is, he's so excited.

27:51.338 --> 27:53.673
I thought it might be a good
idea for us to get acquainted,

27:53.840 --> 27:56.760
so I wanted
to introduce myself, and...

27:56.926 --> 27:58.720
Whoa. Whoops.

27:58.887 --> 28:00.430
Phil?

28:00.597 --> 28:02.098
Sorry, I didn't know
anyone was here.

28:02.265 --> 28:05.810
Phil, this is Kat's mother,
Mrs. Connors.

28:05.977 --> 28:07.729
. Hey.
- (Laughs)

28:07.896 --> 28:11.191
She just, uh, came by
to say hello.

28:11.358 --> 28:14.986
Uh, okay.

28:15.153 --> 28:18.239
Well, I'm just gonna
head to my room.

28:26.081 --> 28:27.916
He's a nice boy.

28:28.083 --> 28:30.585
You can rest assured, Eve,
that my Phil

28:30.752 --> 28:32.629
will take good care
of your daughter.

28:32.796 --> 28:37.842
He's rented a tux, (laughs)
and everything.

28:38.009 --> 28:39.135
Yes.

28:41.304 --> 28:45.058
I'm taking Kat to the mall
this afternoon to buy a new dress.

28:47.102 --> 28:49.062
Dr. Thaler: If your mother
was so unhappy,

28:49.229 --> 28:51.398
why do you think she married
your father in the first place?

28:51.564 --> 28:55.068
(laughs)
God, I have no idea.

28:55.235 --> 28:58.738
(laughs)
Because he was there?

28:58.905 --> 29:02.325
Kat: I mean,
he wanted to marry her.

29:02.492 --> 29:04.869
She had no
other choice, maybe?

29:05.036 --> 29:07.288
I mean, she went to college,
and she was working as a receptionist,

29:07.455 --> 29:10.417
but what else was
she gonna do?

29:14.629 --> 29:15.797
I guess life with my father

29:15.964 --> 29:18.633
must have been pretty bleak
and miserable for her.

29:20.635 --> 29:21.970
In the weeks before she left

29:22.137 --> 29:24.013
I noticed that she started
dressing different.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.975
What do you mean,
different?

29:27.142 --> 29:31.396
Like, her clothes
got tighter. Sexier.

29:31.563 --> 29:34.649
I mean, she even bought
a miniskirt. (Chuckles)

29:34.816 --> 29:37.176
Then there was that night that
she walked in on me and Phil.

29:39.070 --> 29:40.697
I think it's time
for Phil to go home.

29:40.864 --> 29:43.241
- What? Why?
- It's late.

29:43.408 --> 29:45.994
It's not even midnight.

29:46.161 --> 29:50.748
Kat, what I say goes.
And I say go to bed.

29:50.915 --> 29:53.376
Kat: The weirdest part was that
she had on this nightgown

29:53.543 --> 29:55.128
that was practically see-through.

29:55.295 --> 29:58.089
It was almost like
she was putting on a show.

29:58.256 --> 30:00.383
Could it be that's
what she was doing?

30:00.550 --> 30:02.969
What? Putting on a show?

30:03.136 --> 30:05.763
(laughs)
For me, or for Phil?

30:07.974 --> 30:09.934
No.

30:10.101 --> 30:12.395
I think she was just bored.

30:12.562 --> 30:16.649
And getting older, and trying
to get whatever attention she could.

30:19.777 --> 30:22.739
It was almost like she wanted to have
an affair or something.

30:25.450 --> 30:27.952
Do you think that's
what was going on?

30:28.119 --> 30:31.247
No. I mean,
I can't imagine it.

30:31.414 --> 30:35.293
But, I guess anything's
possible, right?

30:35.460 --> 30:37.337
Phil: Oh. Sorry.

30:39.422 --> 30:41.758
I tried knocking
but there was no answer.

30:41.925 --> 30:45.929
That's all right. Could I help
you with something?

30:46.095 --> 30:49.891
I'm just looking
for my mom's stupid cat.

30:50.058 --> 30:52.310
Have you seen him?

30:52.477 --> 30:55.480
Can't say that I have.

30:55.647 --> 30:59.192
Oh. Okay. Sorry to
bother you, Mrs. Connors.

30:59.359 --> 31:04.405
(laughs) Mrs. Connors sounds
so formal. Call me Eve.

31:04.572 --> 31:07.242
Oh. All right.

31:07.408 --> 31:08.910
You know, the time when
I was your age

31:09.077 --> 31:11.329
doesn't seem so far away to me.

31:14.207 --> 31:17.919
Well, I should probably
look for my mom's cat.

31:20.547 --> 31:23.716
Phil, would you like to have
dinner with us tonight?

31:23.883 --> 31:26.219
I'm making crab thermador.

31:28.388 --> 31:30.807
Uh, sure.

31:32.183 --> 31:34.352
Dinner is at seven.

31:34.519 --> 31:38.189
Cool. Thanks, Mrs. Connor.
I mean...

31:39.774 --> 31:41.067
Eve.

31:55.873 --> 31:58.543
(phone ringing)

31:58.710 --> 32:01.070
(Theo) Uh, yeah, you've reached
Detective Theo Scieziesciez.

32:01.087 --> 32:02.922
Leave a message
after the beep.

32:03.089 --> 32:04.757
(beep)

32:04.924 --> 32:08.469
Hi. Um, Detective.
It's, uh, it's Kat Connors.

32:08.636 --> 32:10.513
I'm just... I'm just
calling because I think

32:10.680 --> 32:14.142
I might have
some information

32:14.309 --> 32:16.603
about my mother. Uh...

32:53.014 --> 32:54.849
(knocking)

33:02.398 --> 33:05.985
Hey. Thanks again
for meeting me here.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.472
Couldn't bear the thought
of going

33:07.487 --> 33:08.655
into the office
on my day off, you know?

33:08.821 --> 33:10.073
(laughs) No problem.

33:10.239 --> 33:11.908
Come on in.

33:12.075 --> 33:14.702
Thank you.

33:16.954 --> 33:18.539
It ain't fancy,
but it's home.

33:18.706 --> 33:21.459
(laughs)

33:21.626 --> 33:24.045
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah, sure.

33:24.212 --> 33:26.381
I'd offer you a beer,
but you're not of age.

33:26.547 --> 33:28.633
I'd take one anyway.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.635
All right then.

33:35.098 --> 33:36.683
Sit down.

33:56.536 --> 33:58.705
- Go on.
- Thanks.

34:02.917 --> 34:07.171
So? What do you want
to talk to me about?

34:08.922 --> 34:11.134
I, um...

34:11.300 --> 34:15.138
I... I called because
I have some new information.

34:15.304 --> 34:18.224
I just remembered
some things, and,

34:18.391 --> 34:20.768
I think my mother may
have been having an affair.

34:20.935 --> 34:22.353
Oh: Yeah?

34:22.520 --> 34:25.815
I mean, it could explain
why she left, right?

34:27.775 --> 34:31.237
Maybe. I'll look
into it on Monday.

34:32.196 --> 34:33.781
Okay.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.163
Is that it?

34:40.329 --> 34:43.416
I just thought that it might be,
like, relative to the case.

34:50.757 --> 34:52.257
Are you nervous?

34:53.842 --> 34:58.389
(laughs) I guess.
A little.

34:58.556 --> 35:02.435
Well, you know you can leave
any time you want, right?

35:02.602 --> 35:04.312
I know.

35:05.438 --> 35:08.691
But, uh, you don't want
to leave, do you.

35:12.695 --> 35:15.072
Because you came here
to seduce me.

35:17.533 --> 35:21.746
Well, congratulations,
sweetheart. It worked.

35:22.997 --> 35:24.582
I'm seduced.

35:27.043 --> 35:28.836
And how old are you?

35:29.003 --> 35:30.254
Eighteen.

35:30.421 --> 35:32.799
You're not a virgin,
are you?

35:32.965 --> 35:34.675
(laughs) No.

35:36.427 --> 35:39.222
So, uh...

35:39.388 --> 35:42.892
you know what's about
to happen, right?

35:43.059 --> 35:45.728
And are you sure
that's what you want?

35:48.856 --> 35:53.528
Because I'm not one of your punk
classmates from school, you know?

35:53.694 --> 35:55.321
I know.

36:06.707 --> 36:09.252
Well, you're hot,
that's for sure.

36:10.711 --> 36:13.214
Your tits are perfect.

36:14.966 --> 36:18.219
But you already know that,
don't you.

36:23.015 --> 36:25.393
Maybe I should come over
there and join you.

36:27.395 --> 36:28.896
Yeah.

36:39.866 --> 36:41.784
This better?

36:41.951 --> 36:43.369
Mm-hm.

36:56.173 --> 36:58.551
Why don't you take
this top off, huh?

37:23.242 --> 37:25.828
Fucking amazing.

37:34.128 --> 37:36.088
Is this what you want?

37:36.255 --> 37:37.590
Yeah.

38:00.321 --> 38:02.490
- Hey.
- What?

38:06.702 --> 38:08.287
Everything all right?

38:08.454 --> 38:11.040
Yeah. I just don't sleep
so good sometime.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.669
I've seen a lot
of bad shit.

38:15.920 --> 38:17.630
Dead people.

38:17.797 --> 38:19.632
Very unhappy about it.

38:19.799 --> 38:21.717
Oh yeah?

38:21.884 --> 38:23.344
Yeah.

38:25.137 --> 38:27.640
Trust me,
you don't wanna know.

38:27.807 --> 38:29.225
Try me.

38:31.978 --> 38:33.896
All right.

38:36.732 --> 38:41.320
Once there was
this obese man,

38:44.115 --> 38:47.243
some sick fuck had doused him
with gasoline

38:47.410 --> 38:49.996
and lit him on fire.

38:50.162 --> 38:54.667
And by the time
we got to the body,

38:54.834 --> 38:56.877
two days later,

38:58.629 --> 39:00.381
he was still burning.

39:00.548 --> 39:01.882
What?

39:03.551 --> 39:06.345
Guy had so much body fat,

39:07.596 --> 39:09.682
he was like
a human candle.

39:15.479 --> 39:18.357
And there's
one thing I've learned,

39:18.524 --> 39:21.986
in all my years as a cop,

39:24.363 --> 39:29.660
it's that people are capable
of doing horrible,

39:29.827 --> 39:32.705
unimaginable things
to each other.

39:37.835 --> 39:40.671
Love how slippery you are.

39:40.838 --> 39:42.757
Feel like I could break you
in half.

39:42.923 --> 39:44.759
(laughs) I'm tougher
than I look.

39:44.925 --> 39:46.552
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

39:46.719 --> 39:48.971
- Wanna try me?
- (Laughs) Yes.

39:49.138 --> 39:52.224
- (alternative rock music)
- Oh, my God.

39:52.391 --> 39:54.310
What? It was easy.

39:54.477 --> 39:56.353
What do you mean
it was easy?

39:56.520 --> 39:59.690
I mean I went over there
and I fucked him.

39:59.857 --> 40:02.401
Wow. I'm impressed.

40:02.568 --> 40:05.654
Truly, truly impressed.
So was it hot?

40:05.821 --> 40:08.616
Oh, hell yes.
Like, so much better than Phil.

40:08.783 --> 40:09.783
Deets, girl, deets.

40:09.867 --> 40:12.244
He's just, like, so manly.

40:12.411 --> 40:16.749
Like, cock, and balls, and, like,
hairy chest, and muscles, and,

40:16.916 --> 40:20.503
like, the way he smells, Beth,
is so intense. It's, like, primal.

40:22.004 --> 40:23.798
Oh, I can still
smell him on me now.

40:23.964 --> 40:25.966
- Oh, my God, let me smell..
- (Laughs)

40:26.133 --> 40:28.511
Oh, God, that's so hot.

40:28.677 --> 40:30.930
One day I hope some
musky macho stud

40:31.097 --> 40:32.417
will fuck the shit out of me too.

40:32.515 --> 40:36.936
- Oh, it'll happen.
- Oh, yeah. When? When?

40:37.103 --> 40:39.438
I'm so proud of you.

40:39.605 --> 40:42.566
Why? Because I fucked
an old guy?

40:42.733 --> 40:44.151
Yeah.

40:44.318 --> 40:46.278
I mean, don't take this
the wrong way, Kat,

40:46.445 --> 40:47.863
but for the longest time

40:48.030 --> 40:49.824
you were acting like
you were still fat.

40:49.990 --> 40:51.617
Oh my God.
What are you talking about?

40:51.784 --> 40:54.161
I mean, you lost all
of that weight, like,

40:54.328 --> 40:56.163
what, three years ago?

40:56.330 --> 40:59.083
But you're still skulking
around all angsty and awkward.

40:59.250 --> 41:02.294
Like a fat chick. Like me.

41:02.461 --> 41:05.881
And Mickey, who's basically
a fat chick in a skinny gay body.

41:06.048 --> 41:07.633
(laughs)

41:07.800 --> 41:11.637
- You're crazy.
- It's true.

41:11.804 --> 41:12.721
(on answering machine)
Mr. Connor,

41:12.888 --> 41:15.008
this is Sheryl from the
Lorna Linda Police Department.

41:15.141 --> 41:18.686
I'm pleased to inform you that
you passed your lie detector test.

41:18.853 --> 41:22.314
Thank you for your cooperation,
and have a nice day.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.900
(beep)

41:25.067 --> 41:27.653
Why would your dad need
to take a lie detector test?

41:27.820 --> 41:29.738
I have no idea.

41:29.905 --> 41:32.199
Well, do you think the cops
think he knows something?

41:32.366 --> 41:35.119
My dad? Beth,
have you met him? (Laughs)

41:35.286 --> 41:38.581
Look up clueless in the dictionary
and there's a picture of him.

41:38.747 --> 41:40.947
- Must be some kind of mistake.
- (Squeaking car brakes)

41:41.041 --> 41:43.085
Probably.

41:44.461 --> 41:47.423
I think that's his car.
Just ask him.

41:47.590 --> 41:50.634
- Do you want me to leave?
- What? No. Whatever.

41:50.801 --> 41:52.011
I'm sure it's nothing.

41:52.178 --> 41:53.846
(door closing)

41:54.013 --> 41:56.599
(sighs)
Hi, sweetheart, Beth.

41:56.765 --> 42:00.060
Kids didn't spend too much money
at the mall, I hope?

42:00.227 --> 42:03.355
Nope. I just picked up
a few things.

42:05.065 --> 42:07.568
Hey, dad, there was a,
uh, message for you,

42:07.735 --> 42:12.364
on the machine,
from the police department.

42:12.531 --> 42:14.074
Is there news
about your mother?

42:14.241 --> 42:18.621
No. They said that you passed
the lie detector test?

42:18.787 --> 42:21.665
Oh. Well, whoop-dee-do.

42:21.832 --> 42:23.584
So, you going to join us
for dinner, Beth?

42:23.751 --> 42:25.836
I... I don't think so,
Mr. Connors.

42:26.003 --> 42:27.838
Hm.

42:28.005 --> 42:30.049
Dad, why would they want you
to take a lie detector test?

42:30.216 --> 42:33.510
Beats me. It's standard procedure
in cases like this, I guess.

42:35.846 --> 42:38.515
So what are you feeling,
sweetheart?

42:38.682 --> 42:40.935
Should we order takeout
from that rib place?

42:41.101 --> 42:43.103
Yeah, sure.

42:54.031 --> 42:55.699
Mom?

42:58.035 --> 43:00.955
What is it?
What's going on?

43:02.331 --> 43:04.291
Is Phil a good fuck?

43:06.168 --> 43:07.962
Go to bed, mom.

43:08.128 --> 43:10.047
Don't you turn
your back on me!

43:10.214 --> 43:12.508
Seriously,
just go back to bed.

43:12.675 --> 43:15.219
I will not be dismissed
by the likes of you.

43:15.386 --> 43:17.137
- Answer me!
- Ow!

43:17.304 --> 43:19.348
Is Phil a good fuck?

43:19.515 --> 43:22.935
What would you know
about fucking, anyway?

43:24.603 --> 43:26.313
Oh my...
what are you doing?

43:26.480 --> 43:28.023
What is this?

43:28.190 --> 43:29.870
- Mom, what are you...
- Why are you naked?

43:29.900 --> 43:33.195
I was hot! Jesus!
Get out of my room!

43:33.362 --> 43:34.738
Why are you doing this?

43:34.905 --> 43:38.075
What did I ever do
to you? Stop!

43:39.576 --> 43:42.413
I do too know what
a good fuck is.

43:43.580 --> 43:45.249
You little slut.

43:47.459 --> 43:50.713
What is your problem?
(crying)

43:50.879 --> 43:55.384
Are you insane?
What is fucking wrong with you?

44:03.225 --> 44:05.894
Dr. Thaler: What kind of mother
would do something like that?

44:08.564 --> 44:10.190
My mother.

44:12.109 --> 44:16.113
What? What?
That's just how she was.

44:16.280 --> 44:18.907
I mean, everyone has
a crappy childhood.

44:19.074 --> 44:20.326
It's not like she beat me.

44:20.492 --> 44:24.705
So my mom wasn't Hallmark Card
perfect. So fucking what?

44:28.709 --> 44:31.086
I just think
she was lonely.

44:34.298 --> 44:36.467
I used to catch her
staring at me,

44:36.633 --> 44:40.304
like I was wearing something
that I had stolen from her.

44:42.973 --> 44:45.059
You look like I looked
when I was you.

44:45.225 --> 44:46.894
What?

44:47.061 --> 44:50.981
I mean, you look like
I looked when I was your age.

44:51.148 --> 44:53.484
Whatever, lurker.

44:56.028 --> 44:58.322
What? What do you want?

45:00.199 --> 45:02.493
Nothing.

45:02.659 --> 45:06.622
Oh my God, stop gawking at me.
You're creeping me out.

45:06.789 --> 45:09.833
Just, like, get out of here.
Just leave me alone.

45:18.008 --> 45:21.345
About a week
before she disappeared,

45:21.512 --> 45:25.099
Phil and I were in the basement
doing homework,

45:26.517 --> 45:28.227
just like any
other ordinary night.

45:28.394 --> 45:29.603
(rock music playing)

45:29.770 --> 45:32.356
(heels clicking on stairs)

45:32.523 --> 45:35.150
Mrs. Connor: Well, what
do you think? You like?

45:35.317 --> 45:38.070
Pretty sexy for 42, huh?

45:38.237 --> 45:39.613
Mom, what are you doing?

45:39.780 --> 45:43.158
<i>Oh, loosen up,
Miss Prissypants.</i>

45:43.325 --> 45:48.038
Phil. Why don't you and your
mother join us for dinner?

45:48.205 --> 45:51.250
I'm making my world-famous
Beef Wellington.

45:51.417 --> 45:55.254
Uh, yeah, o...
okay, Mrs. Connors. I'll ask.

45:55.421 --> 45:57.089
Splendid.

45:59.174 --> 46:01.593
I'm in the mood for celebrating.

46:01.760 --> 46:03.637
(rock music continues)

46:03.804 --> 46:05.722
Okay, mom, whatever.
We get it already.

46:05.889 --> 46:07.641
Oh, what's the matter, Kat?

46:07.808 --> 46:12.354
Can't stand seeing your mother
have a little fun for a change?

46:12.521 --> 46:14.648
Mr. Connor:
Honey, I'm home!

46:14.815 --> 46:18.986
Oh, and the party is over
before it's even begun.

46:19.153 --> 46:21.363
Sweetheart, where are you?

46:21.530 --> 46:24.491
There you are.
What's for dinner?

46:27.077 --> 46:29.455
What's going on?
Why are you dressed like that?

46:29.621 --> 46:31.081
What? You don't like it?

46:31.248 --> 46:33.000
No. I don't.

46:33.167 --> 46:35.919
Well, tough shit.
You don't like this skirt?

46:36.086 --> 46:37.963
- Eve, stop it.
- I don't care.

46:38.130 --> 46:39.840
(sing-song) You don't like
this skirt and I don't care.

46:40.007 --> 46:41.567
You don't like this skirt
and I don't...

46:41.675 --> 46:44.303
Get your goddamned hands off me!

46:44.470 --> 46:49.892
I'll wear whatever the hell
I want. Whenever I want to!

46:50.058 --> 46:51.685
What are you doing?

46:51.852 --> 46:54.438
What I do every fucking night
of my fucking life,

46:54.605 --> 46:56.899
making your fucking dinner.

47:00.194 --> 47:03.530
- (coughs) Oh, Jesus!
- (Coughs) Oh, shit! What reeks?

47:03.697 --> 47:05.991
The meat. It's all rotten.

47:06.158 --> 47:07.576
Must have come unplugged.

47:07.743 --> 47:09.703
Don't just stand there,
plug it back in!

47:09.870 --> 47:11.872
Smells like a fucking
dead body in here!

47:21.798 --> 47:25.761
Well, looks like we're
going out for dinner tonight.

47:25.928 --> 47:27.638
Wanna get Chinese?

47:27.804 --> 47:31.808
No. I don't want
fucking Chinese.

47:33.602 --> 47:37.189
Okay, then, what would make you
happy, Evie? What do you want?

47:39.107 --> 47:41.109
I don't want this.

47:41.276 --> 47:44.530
I don't want any of it.

47:44.696 --> 47:48.116
You, this house.

47:48.283 --> 47:49.660
Evie.

47:49.826 --> 47:52.871
I want my fucking
life back.

47:55.707 --> 47:57.668
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's go to dinner.

47:57.834 --> 48:01.380
I don't want
fucking dinner!

48:01.547 --> 48:05.217
Why won't anyone
listen to me?

48:14.268 --> 48:17.354
(soulful music)

48:36.248 --> 48:40.586
Girl: So out of the blue
she was just, like, poof?

48:40.752 --> 48:42.337
Kat: Pretty much.

48:43.338 --> 48:45.465
Girl: Wow.

48:45.632 --> 48:48.635
You told me your mom left,
but not like that.

48:48.802 --> 48:52.889
Well, we've been roommates
for almost a year, so.

48:53.056 --> 48:54.182
But don't you wonder where she is?

48:54.349 --> 48:55.909
I mean, she's gotta
be somewhere, right?

48:56.059 --> 48:57.978
I don't know, it's weird.

48:58.145 --> 49:00.105
Hardly even think
about her anymore.

49:00.272 --> 49:02.524
You know, it's, like,
so much time has passed,

49:02.691 --> 49:04.901
that kinda just gotten used to it.

49:05.068 --> 49:07.738
Guess going home next week
for break

49:07.904 --> 49:11.783
has kinda resurrected
the ghost from my past.

49:11.950 --> 49:14.119
Speaking of ghosts,
you're not gonna go see

49:14.286 --> 49:16.496
that loser boyfriend of yours,
what's-his-name, are you?

49:16.663 --> 49:18.081
You mean Phil? (Laughs)

49:20.000 --> 49:22.878
Maybe. Why?

49:23.045 --> 49:25.380
Well, you know
I'm team Oliver.

49:25.547 --> 49:27.466
We've only been dating
for a couple of months.

49:27.633 --> 49:29.885
So? That's enough to know
that he's hot, and smart,

49:30.052 --> 49:32.971
and actually has a future,
unlike what's-his-name.

49:33.138 --> 49:36.183
Cindy, you met Phil once,
for a weekend.

49:36.350 --> 49:38.560
Yeah, that was enough.

49:38.727 --> 49:42.814
(laughs) Whatever.
The future bores me.

49:44.566 --> 49:46.985
What's going on with you
tonight? Ls everything okay?

49:47.152 --> 49:49.404
Yeah, why?

49:49.571 --> 49:52.032
I don't know, you seem
a million miles away.

49:52.199 --> 49:56.787
Sorry.
Just a little preoccupied.

49:56.953 --> 49:58.664
I'm fine.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.335
What?

50:05.003 --> 50:06.797
Nothing.

50:06.963 --> 50:09.591
Don't say nothing
when it's something.

50:09.758 --> 50:11.843
Okay, you know I don't
like it when you smoke.

50:12.010 --> 50:14.130
It's bad for you, especially
since you're on the pill.

50:14.179 --> 50:15.972
Yeah, well, this is only my
second one today.

50:16.139 --> 50:17.683
I'm cutting back, just for you.

50:17.849 --> 50:21.895
Don't cut back for me. Okay?
It's your health we're talking about.

50:26.066 --> 50:27.651
Okay, doctor.

50:29.486 --> 50:31.029
Are you satisfied?

50:31.196 --> 50:32.781
Not if you're
gonna be mad.

50:32.948 --> 50:34.908
Why would I be mad? Hm?

50:35.075 --> 50:36.910
Just because you're
telling me what to do?

50:37.077 --> 50:39.246
I mean, I can't smoke in my room
because Cindy says it stinks,

50:39.413 --> 50:41.581
and I can't smoke around you
because you say it's unhealthy.

50:41.748 --> 50:43.208
Kat, it's not like you're
addicted to nicotine.

50:43.375 --> 50:44.501
You've been smoking for two months.

50:44.668 --> 50:47.587
Okay, well, whatever. I just want
to be free to do what I want.

50:47.754 --> 50:49.798
Okay, fine.
Go ahead and smoke.

50:49.965 --> 50:51.842
I don't want to fight.

50:57.013 --> 50:59.182
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

50:59.349 --> 51:01.184
I just...
I want you to be happy.

51:03.103 --> 51:05.772
- I think I'm just gonna head home.
- Wait. What?

51:05.939 --> 51:07.941
I'm going.
I have studying to do.

51:08.108 --> 51:10.402
Kat, come on. What are...
what are you doing? Just stay.

51:10.569 --> 51:12.487
Goodnight, Oliver.

51:14.698 --> 51:17.159
Oh my God, what is the matter
with you? Seriously?

51:17.325 --> 51:21.329
What did I do?
Kat? Kat!

51:21.496 --> 51:24.416
(rock music playing)

51:53.111 --> 51:55.614
(inaudible)

51:57.032 --> 51:59.117
- Hey! Hi, dad.
- (Music shuts off)

51:59.284 --> 52:00.285
Wow.

52:00.452 --> 52:02.746
(laughs) What?

52:02.913 --> 52:04.581
I can't believe
how grown up you look.

52:04.748 --> 52:07.751
Oh, God. Can we forego
the theatrics, please?

52:07.918 --> 52:11.505
Whatever. Act as jaded as you
want, I missed my little girl

52:11.671 --> 52:13.715
- and I'm not ashamed to say so.
- (Laughs)

52:13.882 --> 52:15.842
So how is Berkeley? Thanks
for all the letters, by the way.

52:16.009 --> 52:17.409
Oh, sorry.
Been studying my ass off.

52:17.552 --> 52:18.595
I know, I know.

52:18.762 --> 52:21.848
You're a big city girl now.
No time for your poor old dad.

52:24.434 --> 52:26.603
I'm glad you're home,
sweetheart.

52:26.770 --> 52:28.814
Yeah.

52:31.858 --> 52:33.360
Uh, sh... should we?

52:33.527 --> 52:36.446
Yes. No, I got it.
I got it. Ugh.

52:36.613 --> 52:38.323
- Thank you.
- Here.

52:38.490 --> 52:40.130
So, anything new
and exciting around here?

52:40.283 --> 52:44.371
Oh, not really.
Much the same old, same old.

52:44.538 --> 52:45.872
What?

52:47.582 --> 52:48.750
Dad?

52:50.961 --> 52:52.921
Dad, what is it?
Why are you acting all weird?

52:53.088 --> 52:55.131
Well, I do have
a bit of news.

52:55.298 --> 52:57.217
Is everything okay?

52:57.384 --> 52:59.928
Everything's fine.
I just, um...

53:00.095 --> 53:02.514
Oh my God, just spit
it out already.

53:02.681 --> 53:06.142
I've been seeing someone.

53:06.309 --> 53:09.312
- Really?
- Yes. Does that make you angry?

53:09.479 --> 53:11.731
What? Are you kidding me?
No, dad, mom's been gone

53:11.898 --> 53:14.067
a long time. Why shouldn't you
see other women?

53:15.819 --> 53:17.696
Well, good.

53:17.863 --> 53:19.698
So, what's her name?

53:19.865 --> 53:21.408
- May.
- May?

53:21.575 --> 53:23.660
She's a sales rep
I met at the office.

53:23.827 --> 53:26.830
(laughs)
Dad, that's so great.

53:26.997 --> 53:28.748
Seriously,
I'm really happy for you.

53:28.915 --> 53:31.209
Thank you, sweetheart.
That means a lot to me.

53:33.420 --> 53:35.589
So, what are your plans
while you're at home?

53:35.755 --> 53:37.716
Uh, I have
some studying to do,

53:37.883 --> 53:41.553
but mostly
I just wanna relax,

53:41.720 --> 53:45.640
see some old friends.
You know, the usual.

53:49.102 --> 53:52.063
Wow. Welcome back,
stranger.

53:53.773 --> 53:55.853
- (alternative music playing)
- Such a fucking rebel.

53:55.859 --> 53:57.694
Kat, you're my new idol.

53:57.861 --> 54:02.032
(laughs) Oh, my God,
I've missed you guys.

54:02.198 --> 54:04.318
I mean, my friends at Berkley
are nice and everything,

54:04.326 --> 54:05.869
but just kind of boring.

54:06.036 --> 54:08.204
- Oh, I missed you too.
- (Laughs)

54:08.371 --> 54:11.333
What I haven't missed is this shitty
little pisshole of a town.

54:11.499 --> 54:13.710
Oh my God, my mom told me
to clean my room this morning.

54:13.877 --> 54:15.712
I almost bludgeoned her
to death.

54:15.879 --> 54:17.505
Ugh, I can't believe
we ever lived here.

54:17.672 --> 54:19.132
Oh, I know.

54:19.299 --> 54:22.177
Though I kind of find it reassuring
that this place never changes.

54:22.344 --> 54:25.055
You know? It's like
it's frozen in time.

54:25.221 --> 54:26.431
- Ew.
- Hm.

54:26.598 --> 54:27.724
(laughs)

54:27.891 --> 54:30.477
And you think
you've changed?

54:30.644 --> 54:32.854
Oh, yeah. I'd say so.

54:33.021 --> 54:36.107
I mean, I definitely feel more
comfortable in my own skin.

54:36.274 --> 54:38.193
- School's going well?
- Mm-hm.

54:40.028 --> 54:43.490
And I assume you haven't heard
from your mother.

54:43.657 --> 54:45.575
Nope. Not a word.

54:45.742 --> 54:48.703
How are you feeling about that?
It's been over two years.

54:48.870 --> 54:50.914
(sighs)
I... I don't know.

54:51.081 --> 54:53.625
It's... it's kind of gotten
to the point where

54:53.792 --> 54:56.419
I just don't even expect
to hear from her anymore.

54:56.586 --> 55:00.799
I've just come to this weird
sort of acceptance of it.

55:00.966 --> 55:03.009
Guess I've just moved on.

55:03.176 --> 55:07.138
I mean, even my dad
has himself a new girlfriend.

55:07.305 --> 55:09.641
Does that bother
you at all?

55:09.808 --> 55:12.310
Hm-mm. Why should it?

55:12.477 --> 55:15.438
My mother's gone.
She's never coming back.

55:31.663 --> 55:32.872
Hey.

55:35.291 --> 55:36.584
Hey.

55:36.751 --> 55:40.463
How're you doing?
You look great.

55:42.048 --> 55:44.884
Thank you. You too.

55:46.886 --> 55:50.056
Hey, Aaron, okay if
I grab a smoke break?

55:50.223 --> 55:53.143
Make it quick. We got
a fuckload of work to do.

55:54.352 --> 55:55.812
Come on.

55:59.107 --> 56:01.067
So school's going good?

56:01.234 --> 56:04.362
It's all right. How about you?
How've you been?

56:06.322 --> 56:10.201
You know, work, taking care
of my mom.

56:10.368 --> 56:12.996
Same old, same old.

56:13.163 --> 56:14.998
- How is she?
- My mom?

56:15.165 --> 56:17.042
Yeah.

56:17.208 --> 56:19.127
Batshit crazy as ever.

56:26.092 --> 56:27.510
Can I have one?

56:29.220 --> 56:33.475
Sure. You're smoking now?

56:33.641 --> 56:35.977
Sometimes. Thanks.

56:46.654 --> 56:49.157
When'd you get back
into town?

56:49.324 --> 56:51.910
Um, couple of days ago.

56:52.077 --> 56:53.995
I'm sorry, I...
I would have called sooner.

56:54.162 --> 56:56.623
Just been
really busy, and...

56:58.083 --> 57:00.418
Whatever. It's cool.

57:06.174 --> 57:09.552
But, uh, we should, we should
hang out while I'm here.

57:09.719 --> 57:12.013
Catch a movie
or something?

57:12.180 --> 57:14.724
Yeah. Sounds good.

57:16.392 --> 57:18.770
Here 'til Thursday.

57:18.937 --> 57:20.021
Cool.

57:28.363 --> 57:31.950
You don't have to,
you know.

57:32.117 --> 57:33.618
Have to what?

57:35.411 --> 57:37.288
See me.

57:37.455 --> 57:41.417
I mean, I know you might
not have time for an asshole like me,

57:41.584 --> 57:44.963
now that you're a hot
shit college student.

57:45.130 --> 57:47.757
Phil, what are you
talking about?

57:47.924 --> 57:50.343
Of course
I want to see you.

57:50.510 --> 57:52.137
Right, whatever.

57:55.431 --> 57:58.309
I better get back to work
before my boss has a cow.

57:58.476 --> 57:59.727
Yeah.

58:10.822 --> 58:15.410
I am so sorry that I'm late.
Traffic was ridiculous.

58:15.577 --> 58:18.288
No problem, sweetheart.

58:18.454 --> 58:21.124
Kat, this is May.
May, Kat.

58:21.291 --> 58:23.334
I'm so happy we finally
get the chance to meet.

58:23.501 --> 58:24.627
I've heard
so much about you.

58:24.794 --> 58:28.089
Oh, me too. (Laughs)

58:28.256 --> 58:30.592
And you're even lovelier
than your father described.

58:30.758 --> 58:32.438
Oh. (Raspberries)
I'm sure that's not true,

58:32.468 --> 58:33.636
but thank you anyway.

58:33.803 --> 58:35.972
So how long will you be
in town, Katrina?

58:36.139 --> 58:39.851
Oh, just a week. Then it's back
to the salt mines.

58:40.018 --> 58:42.145
Kat got almost all
"A" s her first semester.

58:42.312 --> 58:44.355
Wow, congratulations.

58:44.522 --> 58:48.193
Yeah. I lucked out. Have you
guys ordered yet? I'm starved.

58:48.359 --> 58:49.986
Your favorite,
the spinach artichoke appetizer.

58:50.153 --> 58:52.447
- It's already on its way.
- Oh, yes.

58:52.614 --> 58:54.574
I'm going to make a quick trip
to the ladies room.

58:54.616 --> 58:56.576
If the waiter comes,
you know what I want.

58:56.743 --> 58:58.494
Right, okay.

59:07.128 --> 59:10.965
So, uh, are you
all right with this?

59:11.132 --> 59:14.093
What? You mean May?

59:14.260 --> 59:17.222
Yeah, Dad I like her.
She seems sweet.

59:17.388 --> 59:19.224
I just don't want it
to be awkward for you.

59:19.390 --> 59:21.893
Dad, I told you I am thrilled
that you met someone.

59:22.060 --> 59:24.479
Seriously,
you deserve to be happy.

59:30.026 --> 59:32.195
Took off your
wedding ring.

59:35.281 --> 59:38.284
It makes May
uncomfortable.

59:38.451 --> 59:41.412
I put it back on
when she's not around.

59:41.579 --> 59:44.165
Why bother?
I mean, mom left us.

59:44.332 --> 59:47.543
She's the one who made
that choice. I accept that now.

59:47.710 --> 59:51.381
It's about time
we get on with our lives.

59:54.342 --> 59:58.054
(water splashing)

01:00:04.102 --> 01:00:05.520
Mom?

01:00:09.148 --> 01:00:10.733
Kat.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.652
What is it? What's wrong?

01:00:12.819 --> 01:00:17.991
I put my hands in the water,
and they disappeared.

01:00:19.075 --> 01:00:20.493
What?

01:00:22.578 --> 01:00:27.208
I was doing the dishes
and the water was so cold.

01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:30.003
There was a spoon
at the bottom of the sink,

01:00:30.169 --> 01:00:35.216
and when I lifted
my hands out of the water...

01:00:48.271 --> 01:00:49.731
What's the matter?

01:00:49.897 --> 01:00:51.858
Um, nothing.

01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:56.863
Just have strange
dreams sometimes.

01:00:59.115 --> 01:01:01.409
Oh yeah?

01:01:01.576 --> 01:01:03.578
Yeah.

01:01:05.038 --> 01:01:07.540
They started
after my mother disappeared.

01:01:07.707 --> 01:01:09.751
Used to get them all the time.

01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:13.588
It's actually the first one
I've had in weeks.

01:01:13.755 --> 01:01:16.716
You hardly ever talk
about your mother.

01:01:16.883 --> 01:01:19.802
There's not much to say.
She's gone.

01:01:22.096 --> 01:01:24.724
The shrink says
dreams are meaningless.

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:28.561
I don't think
I agree with that.

01:01:31.147 --> 01:01:33.483
What do you think
my dreams mean?

01:01:44.035 --> 01:01:45.787
You really want my opinion?

01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:47.914
Of course.
Why wouldn't I?

01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:56.881
As you know, we did an exhaustive
search for your mother.

01:01:57.048 --> 01:02:00.385
Exhaustive? You guys barely
even looked for her.

01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:04.097
Actually, a very thorough
investigation was done.

01:02:04.263 --> 01:02:06.682
We spent over two years
looking for your mom.

01:02:06.849 --> 01:02:09.769
Not a single trace
was ever found.

01:02:09.936 --> 01:02:13.022
Mm-hm. Whatever.

01:02:14.899 --> 01:02:16.984
So where do you
think she is?

01:02:20.655 --> 01:02:22.615
I think she's dead.

01:02:25.326 --> 01:02:27.537
What?

01:02:27.703 --> 01:02:30.706
Well, you said yourself
she was having an affair,

01:02:30.873 --> 01:02:32.708
which we confirmed.

01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:35.503
With your neighbor,
Mrs. Blangman?

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.423
Mrs. Hillman.

01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:42.927
Whatever. She said your mom
had a boyfriend.

01:02:43.094 --> 01:02:45.263
How would she know?

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:46.889
She's nosy.

01:02:47.056 --> 01:02:48.975
She can't see.

01:02:53.396 --> 01:02:56.107
Wait... whatever. Even if
my mom did have a boyfriend,

01:02:56.274 --> 01:02:58.192
doesn't it just make it
that much more likely

01:02:58.359 --> 01:03:00.445
that she just ran off somewhere?

01:03:05.533 --> 01:03:08.286
- What?
- Ah...

01:03:08.453 --> 01:03:10.830
What? What is it?
What aren't you saying?

01:03:13.124 --> 01:03:16.002
We did a thorough background
check on your father.

01:03:16.169 --> 01:03:19.422
Several interviewees told us

01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:23.217
that he was a pretty jealous
and volatile man.

01:03:23.384 --> 01:03:26.179
My dad is a fucking wimp.

01:03:26.345 --> 01:03:28.306
That's why he used
to drive my mom crazy.

01:03:28.473 --> 01:03:30.892
Not according to Bob
and Margie Carlsen.

01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:33.144
- Who are they?
- Your former neighbors.

01:03:33.311 --> 01:03:36.314
Your parents used to live next
door to them in Riverside.

01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:39.901
They told us that when your
father suspected your mother

01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:42.403
had a thing
for Bob Carlsen,

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:44.989
he lit a trash can on fire

01:03:45.156 --> 01:03:47.825
and he tossed it
onto their patio.

01:03:49.535 --> 01:03:52.121
(laughs)
That's ridiculous.

01:03:54.582 --> 01:03:59.170
Never even heard of these people,
and that was two decades ago.

01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:03.132
Fine, if my dad was so dangerous,

01:04:03.299 --> 01:04:05.801
then why didn't
you ever arrest him?

01:04:05.968 --> 01:04:08.471
No evidence.

01:04:08.638 --> 01:04:11.724
We didn't even have sufficient
cause for a search warrant.

01:04:11.891 --> 01:04:16.062
Asked for my professional
opinion, and I told you.

01:04:16.229 --> 01:04:19.440
Kat, that's just
what I think.

01:04:19.607 --> 01:04:20.900
Which is?

01:04:23.653 --> 01:04:25.093
I think you father
caught your mother

01:04:25.238 --> 01:04:27.532
fucking her boyfriend
and he killed her.

01:04:29.033 --> 01:04:31.285
Well, then what did he do
with the body?

01:04:34.205 --> 01:04:36.332
That's a damn mystery.

01:04:49.345 --> 01:04:53.307
Kat. Come on.

01:04:53.474 --> 01:04:54.934
Where are you going?

01:04:55.101 --> 01:04:57.144
You know what I think,
Detective?

01:04:58.437 --> 01:05:01.023
I think you're
full of shit.

01:05:05.611 --> 01:05:06.821
(door slam)

01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:20.793
(laughs) Come on, strong man.
You can do better than that.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.461
What, like this?

01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:25.548
(laughs) No. Harder.

01:05:25.715 --> 01:05:27.550
(laughs)

01:05:27.717 --> 01:05:30.636
Put those muscles to good use
for a change. That's better.

01:05:30.803 --> 01:05:34.890
That's it. Come on,
give it a whack. (Laughs)

01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:42.523
You're already here?

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:47.111
Uh, yeah. I was just helping
your mom with dinner.

01:05:47.278 --> 01:05:49.196
Unlike some people.

01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:00.666
(knocking)

01:06:05.713 --> 01:06:09.550
Hi, Mrs. Hillman. It's Kat.
I'm sorry, were you in bed?

01:06:09.717 --> 01:06:12.928
Oh, oh no. I...
I was just lying down.

01:06:13.095 --> 01:06:15.890
I... I haven't been
feeling well.

01:06:16.057 --> 01:06:18.809
Oh. Well, I'm sorry to bother
you. But, uh, is Phil here?

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:21.062
No. He isn't.

01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:24.023
- Do you know where he is?
- I'm afraid not.

01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:26.525
That boy sometimes goes out
gallivanting

01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:29.654
'til all hours of the night.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:32.281
Okay, well, could you please tell him
to call me as soon as he gets home?

01:06:32.448 --> 01:06:35.159
- It's kind of important.
- Uh... of course.

01:06:35.326 --> 01:06:37.703
Thank you. Sorry again
for bothering you.

01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:42.208
Oh, it's... it's no problem.
Goodnight, dear.

01:06:42.375 --> 01:06:43.959
Good night.

01:07:03.896 --> 01:07:05.898
Dad: I don't think it's right
with her here.

01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:08.025
May: But if Kat says she's
comfortable, I don't...

01:07:08.067 --> 01:07:11.320
I don't care
what Kat said.

01:07:11.487 --> 01:07:13.155
Dad?

01:07:13.322 --> 01:07:16.409
Honey? Aww, I'm sorry.

01:07:16.575 --> 01:07:18.452
I didn't mean
to wake you.

01:07:18.619 --> 01:07:20.788
If you two are arguing
over whether or not.

01:07:20.955 --> 01:07:23.791
May can sleep over,
it's totally fine.

01:07:23.958 --> 01:07:25.418
Sweetheart, I don't think...

01:07:25.584 --> 01:07:27.962
No, no, no, dad, seriously.
I don't mind.

01:07:28.129 --> 01:07:31.549
Well, you're sick, and we have to
get you to the airport tomorrow.

01:07:31.716 --> 01:07:35.970
I'm almost better. My flight's
not until the afternoon.

01:07:36.137 --> 01:07:39.390
You know what, this is my house
and I call the shots around here.

01:07:45.646 --> 01:07:48.023
Sorry, Kat.

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:50.985
I didn't mean for you
to get dragged into this.

01:07:56.407 --> 01:07:59.702
- (alternative rock music)
- To Phil, may he rest in pieces.

01:07:59.869 --> 01:08:01.912
(laughs) Oh, my God,

01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:07.084
No, fuck Phil.
Seriously, fuck him.

01:08:07.251 --> 01:08:09.336
The jerk never
even called me back.

01:08:09.503 --> 01:08:12.173
That's the spirit.
Fuck Phil.

01:08:12.339 --> 01:08:14.717
Or, rather, don't fuck Phil.
Stop fucking Phil.

01:08:14.884 --> 01:08:16.385
- (laughs)
- Yeah. Oh!

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:18.804
Fuck that hot
stud cop instead.

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:21.098
Done and done.

01:08:21.265 --> 01:08:23.058
(all laughing)

01:08:23.225 --> 01:08:25.506
You know, he said something
kind of weird the other night.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.729
What'd he say?

01:08:26.895 --> 01:08:29.439
"I'm gonna plow you
'til you can't walk straight"?

01:08:29.607 --> 01:08:31.317
(laughs)

01:08:31.484 --> 01:08:35.821
No. Um,
yeah, it was so...

01:08:35.988 --> 01:08:40.533
He said that he thinks
my dad killed my mother.

01:08:44.788 --> 01:08:46.582
What?

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:50.752
What?

01:08:52.505 --> 01:08:56.926
I... I told you that, Kat.
Ages ago.

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:58.301
We both did.

01:08:58.469 --> 01:09:00.595
What are you
talking about?

01:09:00.763 --> 01:09:02.973
It was right after
your mom disappeared,

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.643
and you just didn't
seem to want to hear it.

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:09.854
Remember? I asked if maybe
your dad had something to hide?

01:09:10.022 --> 01:09:11.439
You just blew it off.

01:09:11.607 --> 01:09:14.318
You said he was too transparent
to hide anything.

01:09:18.781 --> 01:09:21.200
You guys
are fucking crazy.

01:09:21.367 --> 01:09:23.160
(chuckles)

01:09:23.327 --> 01:09:26.037
(laughs) Yeah. Forget it.

01:09:26.205 --> 01:09:28.499
We both watch
way too much bad TV.

01:09:28.666 --> 01:09:30.792
But that's why
you love us, right?

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:34.921
Ugh. God,

01:09:35.089 --> 01:09:37.841
there's nothing more disgusting
than warm, flat champagne.

01:09:38.008 --> 01:09:39.969
- Here, give me that.
- What?

01:09:40.135 --> 01:09:42.095
The bottle, please.

01:09:44.807 --> 01:09:46.267
What are you doing?

01:09:46.433 --> 01:09:48.352
It's a trick
I learned at school.

01:09:48.519 --> 01:09:50.813
You put the bottle in
the freezer for a few minutes,

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:54.692
and it is chilled to perfection.
Come and help me.

01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:07.037
- Mickey?
- There's no way that I am moving

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:10.583
a bunch of old, moldy
newspapers. Fuck that.

01:10:10.749 --> 01:10:13.502
Get your skinny gay ass
over here.

01:10:14.628 --> 01:10:16.171
Unh.

01:10:16.338 --> 01:10:18.465
Get that one.

01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:21.093
(groans)

01:10:25.514 --> 01:10:27.766
It's stuck.

01:10:27.933 --> 01:10:29.476
What the...

01:10:31.645 --> 01:10:34.690
Why would you lock
a fucking freezer?

01:10:34.857 --> 01:10:37.401
What the hell is going
on down here?

01:10:37.568 --> 01:10:41.947
Nothing. We're just talking,
and drinking champagne.

01:10:45.034 --> 01:10:47.286
Well, it's time
for your friends to leave.

01:10:47.453 --> 01:10:50.080
What are you talking about?

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:52.124
You heard me, Kat.
The party is over.

01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:54.585
Are you joking?

01:10:54.752 --> 01:10:57.212
Dad, I hate to break it to you,
but I'm a fuckin' adult.

01:10:57.379 --> 01:10:59.256
You can't tell me
what to do.

01:10:59.423 --> 01:11:01.634
When you're under my roof,
you will do as I say.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.054
And I'm saying your friends
need to go home, now.

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:06.805
Oh my God.
What is your problem?

01:11:06.972 --> 01:11:08.599
Cool it. (Nervous laughter)
It's... it's okay, Kat.

01:11:08.766 --> 01:11:10.684
- Yeah. Don't worry about it.
- No...

01:11:10.851 --> 01:11:12.978
Goodnight, Mr. Connors.

01:11:13.145 --> 01:11:15.147
Wait, I'll walk
you guys out.

01:11:29.328 --> 01:11:32.957
Thank you for completely humiliating
me in front of my friends.

01:11:33.123 --> 01:11:36.001
So fucking glad I'm
getting out of here tomorrow.

01:11:38.921 --> 01:11:40.089
(door slams)

01:11:40.255 --> 01:11:43.008
Sorry my dad is being
such a douche.

01:11:43.175 --> 01:11:45.552
Whatever. I gotta fly out
early tomorrow anyway.

01:11:45.719 --> 01:11:47.262
Me too, and I'm not
even packed yet.

01:11:47.429 --> 01:11:49.640
Sure you're okay to drive?

01:11:49.807 --> 01:11:52.059
Unlike you lightweights,
I can handle my liquor.

01:11:55.688 --> 01:11:56.855
God, I'm gonna
miss you guys.

01:11:57.022 --> 01:11:59.400
Oh my God, drama queen.

01:11:59.566 --> 01:12:02.152
It'll be summer soon, and we'll
be back in this rancid hellhole

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:04.154
for three freakin' months.

01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:06.407
(all laughing)

01:12:06.573 --> 01:12:08.450
I know.

01:12:08.617 --> 01:12:10.494
Yeah, well, take care.
Don't forget to write.

01:12:10.661 --> 01:12:13.497
Yeah. You too, shithead.

01:12:13.664 --> 01:12:15.416
Bye, Kat. Have a safe flight,
all right?

01:12:15.582 --> 01:12:16.667
- You too.

01:13:00.335 --> 01:13:01.670
Hey.

01:13:04.965 --> 01:13:06.341
Hey.

01:13:06.508 --> 01:13:10.012
Are you all right?
You look drunk.

01:13:10.179 --> 01:13:13.682
Oh, yeah?
Look who's talking.

01:13:16.977 --> 01:13:19.605
So you've been avoiding me
on purpose, or what?

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.778
- What do you mean?
- I came by your house last week.

01:13:25.944 --> 01:13:28.197
Told your mother
that I needed to talk to you.

01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:32.743
Really?
I didn't get the message.

01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:36.497
What did you want
to talk to me about?

01:13:38.290 --> 01:13:40.793
Just been thinking
about a lot of things.

01:13:43.003 --> 01:13:46.423
You know, I feel like
after my mother left,

01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:48.467
everything changed
between us.

01:13:48.634 --> 01:13:52.054
We were different.
You were different.

01:13:54.431 --> 01:13:56.975
Everything was different
after that.

01:13:57.142 --> 01:13:59.269
Phil, where were you that day?

01:13:59.436 --> 01:14:01.480
You were supposed to
pick me up from school.

01:14:02.523 --> 01:14:06.151
I told you.
I was at Thomas'.

01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:10.072
My God, don't you get it?

01:14:10.239 --> 01:14:12.324
It doesn't matter anymore.
You don't have to lie.

01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:15.452
What do you mean? What makes
you think that I'm lying?

01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:17.454
Okay, I'm not
accusing you of lying.

01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:21.750
All I'm saying is whatever it is
that you know, you can just tell me.

01:14:29.049 --> 01:14:31.301
You know what? What we had
was sweet, and cute,

01:14:31.468 --> 01:14:36.223
and great and everything, but I think
we both know that it's over.

01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:39.476
It's in the past, and I need to know
what happened that day

01:14:39.643 --> 01:14:42.354
so that I can move on
with my life.

01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:45.941
Please, Phil, I'm not gonna get
mad at you. I just want to know.

01:14:47.734 --> 01:14:51.113
I told you.
I don't know anything.

01:14:53.157 --> 01:14:55.993
Was there something going on
between you and my mother?

01:14:58.829 --> 01:15:00.497
- What?
- You heard me.

01:15:00.664 --> 01:15:03.417
Were you fucking my mom? Because
some people think that you were.

01:15:03.584 --> 01:15:05.127
What... what...
what people?

01:15:05.294 --> 01:15:09.423
Kat, you're... you're drunk.
And crazy.

01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:13.177
Phil, I just need to know!
Please, I don't care what it is.

01:15:13.343 --> 01:15:15.846
I just cannot keep living
my life in the dark just,

01:15:16.013 --> 01:15:18.223
like, fucking wondering!

01:15:21.768 --> 01:15:23.604
I can't help you, Kat.

01:15:29.568 --> 01:15:31.195
I'm sorry.

01:15:45.626 --> 01:15:47.878
But I will tell you
one thing.

01:15:49.755 --> 01:15:52.216
Your dad knows
where she is.

01:15:52.382 --> 01:15:54.635
He's been keeping her
up his sleeve this whole time.

01:15:57.846 --> 01:15:59.264
What do you mean?

01:16:01.642 --> 01:16:06.021
Don't ask me. Ask him.

01:17:04.997 --> 01:17:08.750
Mrs. Connor:
(distant echo) Kat! Kat!

01:17:08.917 --> 01:17:10.961
I'm up here!

01:17:12.921 --> 01:17:14.923
Over here!

01:17:15.966 --> 01:17:19.511
No! This way!

01:17:19.678 --> 01:17:23.265
Yes!
Right in front of you!

01:17:24.599 --> 01:17:27.102
I'm right here, Kat.

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:32.899
Help me!

01:17:33.066 --> 01:17:36.069
Please! Help me, Kat!

01:17:39.281 --> 01:17:41.074
Help me!

01:19:58.753 --> 01:19:59.963
Kat!

01:20:02.424 --> 01:20:04.050
What are you doing?

01:20:09.347 --> 01:20:10.557
Dad?

01:20:13.393 --> 01:20:15.812
Do you know
where mom is?

01:20:28.742 --> 01:20:30.202
What?

01:20:30.368 --> 01:20:33.121
Do you know where mom is?

01:20:34.581 --> 01:20:37.667
Because Phil says
that you do.

01:20:39.961 --> 01:20:43.757
Phil? Your stoner boyfriend
who can't keep a job?

01:20:54.226 --> 01:20:57.604
(sighs) The answer
is no, I don't.

01:21:05.779 --> 01:21:07.405
Anything else?

01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:19.918
Well, clean up this mess.

01:21:20.085 --> 01:21:23.296
We have to get you to
the airport in a few hours.

01:21:28.385 --> 01:21:30.887
(sobbing) Dad?

01:21:35.267 --> 01:21:36.726
I'm sorry.

01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:42.190
It's all right.

01:21:53.118 --> 01:21:55.579
(cries)

01:22:25.942 --> 01:22:29.321
So make sure to call so I know
that you landed all right.

01:22:29.487 --> 01:22:31.072
Okay.

01:22:33.825 --> 01:22:36.328
So see you
in a couple of months?

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:40.540
Mm-hm.

01:22:54.596 --> 01:22:56.306
I love you, baby.

01:23:03.146 --> 01:23:05.023
I love you too.

01:23:12.864 --> 01:23:14.908
I should probably board.

01:23:20.997 --> 01:23:22.332
See you.

01:23:29.422 --> 01:23:31.049
Goodbye, sweetheart.

01:24:06.209 --> 01:24:08.837
Kat: That was the last
time I saw my father.

01:24:09.003 --> 01:24:12.006
It turns out Beth, Mickey
and Theo were right.

01:24:12.173 --> 01:24:16.511
A few weeks after I left, my dad
got shitfaced drunk in a bar,

01:24:16.678 --> 01:24:19.097
and confessed
to killing my mother.

01:24:21.307 --> 01:24:25.520
He hung himself
in his jail cell with a sheet.

01:24:25.687 --> 01:24:27.397
Before he died,

01:24:27.564 --> 01:24:30.191
he revealed that my mother's body
was in the freezer,

01:24:30.358 --> 01:24:33.987
and that he'd taken it out during
the night while I was sleeping.

01:24:34.154 --> 01:24:38.158
He buried her up in the mountains.
Since it'd been frozen for so long,

01:24:38.324 --> 01:24:40.702
her corpse decomposed
freakishly fast,

01:24:40.869 --> 01:24:43.538
turning to liquid
as it melted.

01:24:43.705 --> 01:24:47.417
By the time they dug her up,
there was basically nothing left.

01:24:52.005 --> 01:24:55.216
I was seventeen
when my mother disappeared.

01:24:55.383 --> 01:24:59.179
Like, one day she was there,
cleaning, making dinner,

01:24:59.345 --> 01:25:03.767
and the next...
she was gone.

01:25:05.852 --> 01:25:08.688
(hums)

01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:49.813
(grunting)

01:26:06.579 --> 01:26:08.665
(chuckles)

01:26:08.832 --> 01:26:11.751
(laughs)

01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:22.470
Stop it.

01:26:31.187 --> 01:26:33.273
Evie, stop.

01:26:37.527 --> 01:26:39.195
(choke)

01:26:39.362 --> 01:26:40.613
Evie.

01:26:42.198 --> 01:26:43.700
Stop.

01:26:45.785 --> 01:26:48.872
(groans)

01:26:52.083 --> 01:26:53.793
Please.

01:26:56.170 --> 01:26:58.089
(cries) Evie.

01:26:59.757 --> 01:27:01.551
Stop!

01:27:05.054 --> 01:27:06.347
Stop.

01:27:08.182 --> 01:27:10.143
(gasps)

01:27:12.353 --> 01:27:14.606
(exhales)

01:27:18.234 --> 01:27:21.029
(weeping)

01:27:24.866 --> 01:27:28.661
(whispering) I love you.

01:27:37.378 --> 01:27:40.340
I love you.

01:27:42.425 --> 01:27:44.719
Kat: Because I never saw
my mother again,

01:27:44.886 --> 01:27:47.889
she remains
in absence to me.

01:27:48.056 --> 01:27:50.433
An empty space.

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:53.686
An invisible,
half remembered ghost.

01:27:55.939 --> 01:27:58.191
So even now I catch
myself thinking

01:27:58.358 --> 01:28:00.693
that I'm gonna run
into her some day.

01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:04.322
Like I'll be at a stop light,
and look over at the car next to me

01:28:04.489 --> 01:28:09.160
and there she'll be,
scowling at me with disapproval.

01:28:09.327 --> 01:28:13.456
Or I'll spot her across some
crowded street, or train station,

01:28:13.623 --> 01:28:17.919
and we'll run toward each other
like one of those cheesy TV movies.

01:28:18.962 --> 01:28:22.340
She'll hug me
like a long, lost lover,

01:28:22.507 --> 01:28:25.593
then take my face
in her long,

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:28.304
graceful hands,

01:28:28.471 --> 01:28:30.848
look me in the eyes
and say...

01:28:34.727 --> 01:28:36.562
"I'm here, Kat.

01:28:38.189 --> 01:28:39.774
I'm here."
