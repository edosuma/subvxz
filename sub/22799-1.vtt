[Mr. Butler] "Will you, I pray,

03:13.300 --> 03:18.539
demand that demi-devil. Why he hath
thus ensnared my soul and body?"

03:22.175 --> 03:24.576
To which, Iago responds,

03:24.578 --> 03:27.978
"Demand me nothing.
What you know, you know.

03:27.980 --> 03:31.448
From this time forth I
will never speak a word."

03:31.450 --> 03:36.488
Now, Iago may be keeping his
trap shut at the end of the play.

03:36.490 --> 03:40.427
But do we, as the audience,
know what his motive is?

03:46.599 --> 03:48.401
Why did Iago ruin Othello?

Anyone?

A certain character named "Cassio."

04:01.480 --> 04:03.016

[Becca] Mr. Butler?

04:07.820 --> 04:09.520
Yes, Becca.

04:09.522 --> 04:12.393
Does Othello really
think Iago is the devil?

04:14.026 --> 04:15.959
Well, that's a good question.

04:15.961 --> 04:17.896
Can anyone from Mr. Coleman's Latin class

04:17.898 --> 04:19.333
tell us what <i>demi</i> means?

04:54.834 --> 04:57.868
I mean, it makes you wonder
like, "What's the point?"

04:57.870 --> 05:01.072
Hey, these kids don't even want
teachers when they have Google.

05:01.074 --> 05:02.940
Yeah. Uh, come on, though.

05:02.942 --> 05:05.476
I mean, sure, yeah, they can get
all the facts from the Internet

05:05.478 --> 05:08.012

Nope. No, we're not taking any
more money from your parents.

06:15.148 --> 06:17.315
And I was thinking,

06:17.317 --> 06:21.355
maybe this would be a good
time for me to go back to work.

06:21.788 --> 06:23.288
Actually,

10:12.184 --> 10:13.417
Well,

10:13.419 --> 10:15.619
in the introduction to the third edition,

10:15.621 --> 10:18.256
we learn that Dostoyevsky was
inspired by the true account

10:18.258 --> 10:20.223
of Pierre Francois Lacenaire,

10:20.225 --> 10:21.825
a French poet turned murderer.

10:21.827 --> 10:24.429
As such, Raskolnikov, much like Lacenaire,

10:24.431 --> 10:26.196
feels himself above his fellow men

10:26.198 --> 10:27.831
and above the law in his brilliance,

10:27.833 --> 10:31.437
ultimately testing those boundaries
through criminal violence.

10:33.105 --> 10:34.807
Wow! [chuckles]

10:35.741 --> 10:38.175
Very good, Lucas. Yeah, see?

Unless they're in this first
position, then they can go two.

Uh, and then, the only other move they
can do is if there is a piece here,

11:51.484 --> 11:53.917
you can capture it and go diagonal. Right?

11:56.489 --> 11:58.256

little bit about yourself, Lucas.

12:36.696 --> 12:38.465
Oh, that's a good move.

you how to play chess then?

12:43.436 --> 12:44.669
No.

12:44.671 --> 12:46.469
Father doesn't have much time off of work,

12:46.471 --> 12:47.707

Well, I hear you're quite
the scholar in every subject.

12:51.878 --> 12:54.411
Have you given any thought to
which one to focus on at college?

12:54.413 --> 12:56.446
Well, I know I wanna go to Harvard.

12:56.448 --> 12:58.949
I figure I can decide what I
wanna study while I'm there,

12:58.951 --> 13:01.484
because they have the
very best of everything.

13:01.486 --> 13:04.625
And there's no use in doing anything
unless you can be the very best at it.

And he, like,

13:18.870 --> 13:22.473
says English is his favorite subject.

13:22.475 --> 13:25.008
He carries a, uh, like a brief case...

13:26.011 --> 13:27.612
- Wow.
- Yeah.

13:27.614 --> 13:29.780
I just don't know how much attention
he's getting from home, you know?

13:29.782 --> 13:32.653
I think... I think he could use a mentor.

13:33.785 --> 13:36.621
It's nice to see you
so excited about school.

13:36.623 --> 13:38.623

- Yeah.
