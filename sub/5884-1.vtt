<i>Last season on AMC's Mad Men...</i>

00:04.335 --> 00:05.985
Well, ho-ho.
Now it's the time.

00:06.065 --> 00:07.761
Gentlemen, Jai Alai.

00:08.010 --> 00:09.738
I made an appointment with
the divorce attorney.

00:09.986 --> 00:11.818
Forget it. I'm not gonna let
you break up this family.

00:12.027 --> 00:13.221
I didn't break up this family.

00:13.516 --> 00:15.333
P.P.L. is being sold and
us along with it.

00:15.597 --> 00:17.038
- Fire us.
- Why would I?

00:17.198 --> 00:18.398
We'll make you a partner.

00:18.544 --> 00:20.392
- Who the hell is Henry Francis?
- No one.

00:22.713 --> 00:23.970
You're a whore!

00:25.059 --> 00:26.259
Pete, we're starting a new agency.

00:26.395 --> 00:28.837
We're here to talk to
you about joining us.

00:29.166 --> 00:30.365
Henry, I have three children.

00:30.517 --> 00:31.895
I don't want you
owing them anything.

00:32.214 --> 00:33.654
I want you to know that
I'm not gonna fight you.

00:35.047 --> 00:36.496
Thank you. Goodbye.

00:36.713 --> 00:38.249
Mommy, she's not Margaret,
she's Jane.

00:38.448 --> 00:39.466
She's my wife.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.193
I need you to find
me an apartment.

00:41.658 --> 00:42.357
<i>(telephone)</i>

00:42.428 --> 00:44.284
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce,
how may I help you?

<i>Man:
Who is don draper?</i>

01:34.570 --> 01:36.339
Excuse me?

01:36.407 --> 01:38.777
Who is don draper?

01:42.352 --> 01:44.520
What do men say
when you ask that?

01:44.588 --> 01:46.758
Well, they usually take
a minute to think about it

01:46.826 --> 01:48.528
Then they do something cute.

01:48.595 --> 01:51.298
One creative director
said he was a lion tamer.

01:51.366 --> 01:53.636
I don't want to do that.

01:55.205 --> 01:57.975
- In the third person?
- I don't know.

01:58.043 --> 02:01.680
Knockout wife, two kids,
house in Westchester.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.783
Take the train...
maybe you take your car

02:03.850 --> 02:05.418
Now that you can afford it.

02:05.486 --> 02:07.587
And who told you that?

02:07.655 --> 02:09.789
Anything?

02:09.858 --> 02:11.893
I mean, now's your chance.

02:13.563 --> 02:16.301
Well, as I said before,
I'm from the Midwest.

02:16.368 --> 02:20.207
We were taught that it's not
polite to talk about yourself.

02:23.680 --> 02:27.820
Obviously your glo-coat
floor wax commercials
caused a bit of a squeal,

02:27.888 --> 02:29.723
On the creative side anyway.

02:29.790 --> 02:31.760
What made you think
of this idea?

02:31.827 --> 02:34.731
I wanted it to be
indistinguishable
from the movies.

02:36.268 --> 02:38.738
I wanted people to be
watching it and say,

02:38.806 --> 02:41.643
"what's happening
in the story right now?"

02:41.711 --> 02:44.281
Oh, it's something else.

02:45.483 --> 02:46.919
"It's not an ad."

02:48.789 --> 02:51.458
At least not for
the first 30 seconds of it.

02:51.526 --> 02:53.628
Very good then.

02:53.697 --> 02:55.533
I think I have all I need.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.869
It's only
a few hundred words,
but on the bright side,

02:57.937 --> 02:59.773
The picture may be
bigger than the article.

02:59.841 --> 03:01.776
Oh, uh, you all should meet.

03:01.844 --> 03:04.146
This is Jack Hammond
from "advertising age."

03:04.214 --> 03:05.983
Roger sterling
and Pete Campbell.

03:06.051 --> 03:07.719
I hope we're not
interrupting this crisp

03:07.787 --> 03:09.322
And engaging portrait
you're painting.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.191
- Ahh...
- ( clatters )

03:11.259 --> 03:13.596
Steady there.

03:16.134 --> 03:19.505
- What happened there?
- Korea.

03:19.573 --> 03:22.043
We're grateful
for your sacrifice.

03:22.111 --> 03:24.013
- Peter.
- Jack.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.149
Well, it's nice
to meet you all.

03:26.217 --> 03:29.821
I'd love to bend your ear
when I finish my book.

03:29.889 --> 03:31.724
Certainly.

03:31.791 --> 03:33.360
Don, it was a pleasure.

03:33.428 --> 03:35.296
- I look forward to the article.
- We all do.

03:41.607 --> 03:44.076
My Uncle lost his leg
hitching a trailer.

03:44.144 --> 03:46.681
Used to ask me
to scratch his toes.

03:46.748 --> 03:49.317
- He didn't have any.
- We don't have time, Roger.

03:49.385 --> 03:51.654
One quick pop, Louise.

03:51.722 --> 03:54.091
All right, where is this party?

03:54.159 --> 03:57.295
- The Sheraton?
- A wooden leg...

03:57.363 --> 04:00.467
They're so cheap they can't
even afford a whole reporter.

04:04.574 --> 04:07.278
I'm Peter Campbell
and I'm assuming you're Jim.

04:07.345 --> 04:10.582
- And this must be Murray.
- Bob... Murray stayed
in Portland.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.020
Too bad.
Missing jackhammer season.

04:13.088 --> 04:14.422
Roger sterling.

04:16.225 --> 04:18.762
- And you must be
Donald draper.
- Don.

04:18.829 --> 04:20.298
Bob.

04:22.269 --> 04:24.804
We're very very excited you
had time to meet with us, don.

04:26.742 --> 04:29.111
Murray told us y&r
had done glo-coat.

04:29.178 --> 04:32.182
Turns out
everybody in New York
except him knows it's you.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.319
And I think they're
a little jealous.

04:35.822 --> 04:37.657
Can't tell who
the client is here.

04:39.461 --> 04:41.862
I know a little,
but what we need to know...

04:41.930 --> 04:44.232
What don needs to know is

04:44.300 --> 04:46.469
What exactly is your concern?

04:46.537 --> 04:48.939
I must say I'm getting
tired of saying this today.

04:49.007 --> 04:50.608
Next time just have
one meeting.

04:52.579 --> 04:55.582
We at Jantzen have had
a steady 25% bite
of the apple.

04:55.650 --> 04:58.353
But the two-piece
is most of our concern.

04:58.421 --> 05:01.825
You have a great bikini.
I've spent some time
with the catalogue

05:01.893 --> 05:04.362
And I would say
no concerns at all.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.700
It's not a bikini.

05:06.768 --> 05:09.338
A bikini is underwear
you wear to the beach.

05:09.406 --> 05:11.775
We make a two-piece
bathing suit.

05:13.446 --> 05:15.147
We're a family company.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.584
And nowadays it's tough
to make a dent

05:17.652 --> 05:20.089
If your ads don't look
like a girlie magazine.

05:20.157 --> 05:23.794
Do you want women who want
bikinis to buy your two-piece

05:23.862 --> 05:26.465
Or do you just want to make sure
women who want a two-piece

05:26.533 --> 05:28.167
Don't suddenly buy a bikini?

05:32.241 --> 05:35.579
My lord.
That question just tied
a knot in my brain.

05:35.647 --> 05:37.549
( chuckles )

05:37.616 --> 05:39.318
Our competitors get bigger

05:39.386 --> 05:41.154
The smaller they make
that swimsuit.

05:42.692 --> 05:44.493
We don't do that.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.996
We would like to find a way
without playing in the gutter.

05:47.064 --> 05:48.866
And that's just who
our customers are.

05:48.934 --> 05:50.769
Right now.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.709
I love how they sit there
like a couple of choirboys.

05:55.778 --> 05:58.214
You know one of them's
leaving New York with v.D.

06:00.084 --> 06:01.853
Where the hell have you been?

06:01.921 --> 06:03.756
- Roger: What's the problem?
- Don!

06:03.824 --> 06:06.326
- Can you give me a minute?
- I don't mind waiting.

06:11.235 --> 06:13.037
<i>( phones ringing )</i>

06:16.510 --> 06:18.679
- How'd it go?
- Get back to work.

06:31.031 --> 06:32.766
How was your interview?

06:32.834 --> 06:35.370
Count to 100 and buzz me.

06:40.945 --> 06:43.214
You missed Jeff Atherton.

06:43.282 --> 06:46.417
He came here expressly
to see you.

06:46.486 --> 06:49.555
I'm sorry, I didn't know
he was coming and I don't
know who that is.

06:49.623 --> 06:53.227
You have no idea how tiny
this place looks to a stranger.

06:53.294 --> 06:54.929
Did you tell him about
the second floor?

06:54.996 --> 06:58.234
I refuse to be any part
of that charade.

06:59.469 --> 07:01.404
I wanted an office downtown.

07:01.473 --> 07:04.242
We overspent.
We could have got
a lot more for our money.

07:04.310 --> 07:05.911
And we could have had
a conference table.

07:05.979 --> 07:08.281
Atherton thought the lack
of a conference table

07:08.348 --> 07:10.784
Was deliberate.
He felt that a...

07:10.852 --> 07:15.023
Circle of chairs
demands a conversation.

07:15.090 --> 07:17.059
About why there is no table.

07:20.598 --> 07:22.399
- ( sighs )
- they loved you.

07:22.466 --> 07:24.902
What exactly is the problem?

07:24.970 --> 07:27.305
Well, first of all
they're prudes.

07:27.373 --> 07:30.110
Second of all
y&r were standing in
the hallway when we left.

07:30.177 --> 07:32.112
You've been on
a cattle call before.

07:32.180 --> 07:33.781
When the competition was fair.

07:33.849 --> 07:36.517
Every hour of my time
has to be accounted for

07:36.585 --> 07:38.420
In the growth of this company.

07:38.487 --> 07:40.756
Get me in a room
where I have a chance.

07:42.827 --> 07:45.798
In the end it's going to come
down to big versus small.

07:45.865 --> 07:48.436
There's two firms
in the middle:
Kenyon & Eckhardt,

07:48.503 --> 07:50.672
And D'Arcy.
They'll cancel
each other out.

07:50.740 --> 07:53.309
<i>Y&r has six floors
of creative.</i>

07:53.377 --> 07:55.579
They can throw bodies
at this account for weeks.

07:55.647 --> 07:58.684
- We don't have
that kind of firepower.
- We don't have to.

07:58.752 --> 08:01.255
We're the scrappy upstart.

08:01.322 --> 08:03.392
You don't say that
to the clients, do you?

08:03.460 --> 08:05.328
<i>Secretary:
Your accountant is waiting.</i>

08:05.396 --> 08:07.265
Send him in.

08:07.332 --> 08:10.836
Creatively, y&r is not capable
of living in this neighborhood.

08:10.905 --> 08:13.006
You know why?

08:13.074 --> 08:15.843
Because you don't work there.

08:22.187 --> 08:25.757
- John.
- Marsha.

08:27.094 --> 08:29.396
- John.
- Marsha.

08:29.464 --> 08:33.269
John!

08:33.336 --> 08:35.407
Happy Thanksgiving.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.677
Oooh, my mother's going
to be over the moon.

08:37.745 --> 08:40.214
Enjoy it.
It's the last thing
we're going to get from them.

08:40.282 --> 08:42.551
- What?
- Did you kill sugarberry?

08:42.619 --> 08:46.258
- That's a third of my work.
- Stop jumping to conclusions.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.929
I guess when Kreutzer
said they were going
to send us all hams

08:48.997 --> 08:51.367
He really meant one
in a cardboard box
with no note.

08:51.434 --> 08:53.336
It's about as subtle
as an atomic bomb.

08:53.404 --> 08:55.072
Maybe they're cheap.

08:55.140 --> 08:57.209
Do you honestly think
this is a good sign?

08:57.276 --> 08:59.178
The work was
old-fashioned.

08:59.246 --> 09:01.014
And whose fault is that?

09:01.082 --> 09:04.286
Well, testing at four
supermarkets in queens,

09:04.354 --> 09:06.856
How much were they
spending? Nothing.

09:06.924 --> 09:09.594
If the test was a success,
they would have gone national

09:09.662 --> 09:11.396
And they could be
a big account.

09:11.464 --> 09:13.399
Damn it!

09:13.467 --> 09:15.402
I thought we were
getting on a streak.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.708
Does this mean I'm down
to two days a week?

09:19.776 --> 09:22.647
- Don hated the work.
- Put the ham on his desk.

09:22.715 --> 09:25.418
He's probably having
Thanksgiving dinner
alone in there.

09:25.486 --> 09:26.887
That's not nice.

09:26.955 --> 09:29.057
Marsha!

09:29.124 --> 09:30.693
I'm serious.

09:33.164 --> 09:35.968
Okay, life insurance policy,
it's a company policy.

09:36.035 --> 09:38.238
It pays the company,
not the family.

09:38.306 --> 09:40.074
What do you think?

09:40.142 --> 09:43.546
It wouldn't be bad to have
a little security for the kids.

09:43.614 --> 09:46.250
According to this,
I'm already a wealthy man.

09:46.317 --> 09:48.420
Uncle Sam will take
a healthy bite.

09:48.487 --> 09:50.055
He already has.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.624
And...

09:51.692 --> 09:54.296
The only other issue
is the house.

09:54.363 --> 09:55.764
What about it?

09:55.832 --> 09:59.403
Well, October 1st
she was supposed to be out.

09:59.471 --> 10:02.808
It seemed so far away
when we agreed to that.

10:02.876 --> 10:06.814
Get her and him out of there
and sell it.

10:06.882 --> 10:10.353
I can call Ben Michaelson
and have him draft a doozy.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.224
Start world war III?

10:13.292 --> 10:15.161
You're carrying a mortgage,

10:15.228 --> 10:17.298
Plus insurance and taxes

10:17.365 --> 10:19.401
For a house you don't live in.

10:20.738 --> 10:22.673
Leave it alone.

10:24.744 --> 10:27.280
So how are your balls?
Are you enjoying yourself?

10:27.348 --> 10:30.051
Come on.

10:30.119 --> 10:32.488
I don't want it like this.
I want it like that.

10:32.556 --> 10:34.959
Not too much of that,
just a little like this.

10:35.027 --> 10:37.831
And then they look at it
and they don't like it.

10:37.899 --> 10:41.905
Two of their test markets
are in Jewish neighborhoods.
They're idiots.

10:41.972 --> 10:45.244
How much does it cost for us
to buy all the product?

10:45.312 --> 10:48.115
Too much and we'd have
to do it every day.

10:50.688 --> 10:53.324
So how much does it cost
for us to get

10:53.391 --> 10:56.295
100 women to line up
at one store, one afternoon,

10:56.362 --> 10:58.331
Clean them out once?

10:58.399 --> 11:01.068
100 people?
Do you know how big
a line that is?

11:01.136 --> 11:02.870
People would talk about it.

11:02.938 --> 11:05.340
- It's a p.R. Stunt.
- We don't do that.

11:05.408 --> 11:08.011
- Why not?
- Because you can't
charge for it.

11:08.079 --> 11:10.782
So what?

11:10.849 --> 11:14.855
Two women
fighting over one ham,

11:14.924 --> 11:16.692
But they have to really fight.

11:16.761 --> 11:18.696
They have to get arrested
or something.

11:18.764 --> 11:20.231
Because it's the last ham.

11:20.299 --> 11:22.669
We don't have to write a play.

11:22.737 --> 11:25.441
It's Thanksgiving.
They're shopping.
The stakes are very high.

11:25.508 --> 11:27.410
Old Chuck Dewey could
probably get a story

11:27.478 --> 11:29.513
In the "daily news"
for a case of something.

11:29.581 --> 11:32.786
$25 per actress.
We could get Gladys
what's-her-name.

11:32.854 --> 11:35.525
Who's the old lady who never
takes off her mittens?

11:35.593 --> 11:38.128
- I don't have any money.
- John!

11:38.196 --> 11:39.964
Marsha!

11:40.032 --> 11:42.601
I can use my expense account
if I say they're whores.

11:42.668 --> 11:44.836
Top-shelf liquor,
what's that gonna run?

11:44.905 --> 11:46.807
Harry gets a case a month

11:46.874 --> 11:48.943
For sticking his nose
up some guy's ass at n.B.C.

11:49.011 --> 11:51.479
Should I run it by don?

11:51.547 --> 11:52.849
Really?

11:54.886 --> 11:57.722
We'll see.
I'll call casting.

12:02.030 --> 12:03.833
<i>( door opens )</i>

12:03.900 --> 12:06.069
Oh, good, I got you
when you're vulnerable.

12:10.175 --> 12:13.146
- What do you need?
- Someone white to carve
our Turkey.

12:13.214 --> 12:15.783
( sighs )
I can't, Roger.
I have plans.

12:15.851 --> 12:19.022
You told me that.
Then you told me you had
the kids the day after.

12:19.090 --> 12:22.461
But you never said no
to Jane's friend Bethany.

12:22.529 --> 12:25.299
- No.
- I was thinking
the other day

12:25.366 --> 12:28.002
About what happens
when you leave here
and it made me very upset.

12:28.070 --> 12:30.106
I could say the same thing.

12:30.174 --> 12:32.576
I'll paint you the picture
that's in my mind.

12:32.644 --> 12:34.679
But if it's true,
I might kill myself.

12:34.747 --> 12:36.850
I've hardly been a monk.

12:36.917 --> 12:39.354
Forget that she knows Jane.

12:39.421 --> 12:42.024
This girl's terrific.
She looks like Virginia Mayo.

12:42.092 --> 12:44.795
She's 25, mount Holyoke
gymnastics team.

12:44.862 --> 12:47.166
See her this weekend.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.903
You hit it off,
come Turkey day maybe
you can stuff her.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.973
( chuckles )

12:56.949 --> 12:59.251
Sweetheart,
8:00 Saturday night,

12:59.319 --> 13:01.554
Jimmy's la grange
for beauty and the beast.

13:01.622 --> 13:03.893
- Roger.
- They have chicken Kiev.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.329
The butter squirts everywhere.

13:17.916 --> 13:20.485
- Hello, Mr. Draper.
- Hello, Celia.

13:27.296 --> 13:30.600
I made you some pork chops.
They're good cold too.

13:30.668 --> 13:32.970
I look forward to it.

13:33.037 --> 13:35.674
But you don't eat nothing.

13:38.044 --> 13:40.947
- Have you seen my shine Kit?
- I put it on the top
of the closet.

13:41.015 --> 13:43.150
<i>- ( TV playing )
- the children coming
this weekend?</i>

13:43.219 --> 13:44.919
No.

13:44.987 --> 13:48.158
You need to put things
back where you found them.

13:48.225 --> 13:50.829
I didn't want to leave it
in the middle of the floor.

14:04.117 --> 14:06.553
Okay, good night.
You have a good weekend.

14:06.621 --> 14:08.590
And eat something.

14:14.801 --> 14:16.569
<i>( gunshot on TV )</i>

14:16.637 --> 14:18.038
<i>( old West music
playing )</i>

14:37.832 --> 14:40.468
Let me out of here!

14:40.535 --> 14:43.672
Let me out of here!

14:45.008 --> 14:47.811
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

14:49.881 --> 14:52.017
Footprints on a wet floor...

14:52.084 --> 14:54.187
That's no longer
a hanging offense.

14:54.254 --> 14:57.191
<i>Glo-coat's
patented formula</i>

14:57.259 --> 14:59.728
<i>Goes on easy
and dries in seconds.</i>

14:59.796 --> 15:01.664
<i>( door opens )</i>

15:04.670 --> 15:07.006
<i>( TV playing )</i>

16:03.754 --> 16:06.323
So how do you know Jane?

16:06.391 --> 16:09.796
Before you ask me all
the questions, you have
to let me finish one glass.

16:11.532 --> 16:13.735
<i>I don't have to ask you
any questions.</i>

16:15.471 --> 16:17.673
I think I'm actually nervous.

16:17.741 --> 16:20.242
I haven't done this
since college.

16:20.310 --> 16:23.247
Not that it was so long ago,
although it seems like it.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.450
I borrowed a dress.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.220
You sat down so fast
I didn't get a good look.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.656
Do you want to see it?

16:39.940 --> 16:41.741
( giggles )

16:44.946 --> 16:46.815
I can't believe I did that.

16:48.919 --> 16:51.189
It's hard to believe
there are two girls
who can wear that.

16:53.227 --> 16:55.763
Don, I want to lift
a shadow off this evening.

16:55.830 --> 16:58.567
I know this is your first date.

16:58.635 --> 17:00.637
First that Roger
was involved in.

17:00.705 --> 17:03.207
Oh, of course.
I'm sure. It's just...

17:05.545 --> 17:08.449
I'm breaking
a lot of my rules
seeing a divorced man.

17:10.152 --> 17:13.222
But Jane has made you
her personal cause.

17:15.025 --> 17:18.162
And there are so many
real problems in the world.

17:19.665 --> 17:21.334
I know.

17:21.402 --> 17:23.804
The world is so dark right now.

17:23.871 --> 17:26.540
The country?

17:26.608 --> 17:30.380
My goodness,
you've made me feel very
serious all of a sudden.

17:32.518 --> 17:34.920
I don't know if I can make you
feel better about the world.

17:34.988 --> 17:37.224
One of the boys killed
in Mississippi...

17:37.292 --> 17:40.096
Andrew Goodman,
he was from here.

17:40.164 --> 17:42.634
A girlfriend of mine
knew him from summer camp.

17:42.701 --> 17:46.440
Is that what it takes
to change things?

17:49.547 --> 17:51.282
What do you do?

17:51.350 --> 17:53.786
I'm an actress.

17:53.854 --> 17:56.123
But right now I'm a super
in the opera.

17:56.190 --> 17:59.562
- And what is that?
- A supernumerary.

17:59.630 --> 18:02.199
We're the actors
that fill the stage.

18:02.268 --> 18:04.337
Like the chorus?

18:04.405 --> 18:06.273
Mmm, no singing.

18:06.341 --> 18:08.009
I do a lot of mock drinking.

18:08.077 --> 18:10.446
I'm a wench.
I'm a...

18:10.514 --> 18:12.548
Courtesan.

18:12.616 --> 18:15.888
Part of a harem.
It depends on the opera.

18:17.358 --> 18:19.493
That is truly fascinating.

18:20.762 --> 18:22.765
I love the music.

18:22.832 --> 18:25.703
And I love backstage.

18:25.771 --> 18:29.043
Our costumes are as good
as the singers.

18:29.110 --> 18:31.313
And I love the stories.

18:31.380 --> 18:34.017
They're very romantic.

18:34.085 --> 18:35.920
Have you been?

18:35.987 --> 18:37.890
I have.

18:37.957 --> 18:41.661
But only for business
so I've never enjoyed it.

18:41.729 --> 18:44.265
Well, then you must
come as my guest.

18:46.636 --> 18:49.373
They give the supers tickets
instead of paying
a decent wage.

18:51.477 --> 18:53.078
- Madam?
- Oh, I don't even
need to look.

18:53.146 --> 18:54.780
Chicken Kiev.

18:54.849 --> 18:56.516
They make you wear a bib.

18:56.584 --> 18:59.455
Come on, let's have some fun.

19:00.591 --> 19:02.226
Two chicken Kievs.

19:11.509 --> 19:13.179
The barbizon.

19:13.246 --> 19:14.982
I bet that would
make a great opera.

19:15.049 --> 19:17.285
It would.

19:17.354 --> 19:19.956
Well, I guess
this is good night.

19:20.024 --> 19:22.494
Okay.

19:24.732 --> 19:26.334
Good night.

19:28.505 --> 19:31.509
So am I going to see you
at Roger and Jane's
for Thanksgiving?

19:33.846 --> 19:35.848
It's tempting, but...

19:35.915 --> 19:37.985
I have plans.

19:38.053 --> 19:41.255
Oh, I'm sure the holidays
must be very complex.

19:58.214 --> 20:01.985
It may have been awhile
since you've had to pick up
on messages,

20:02.052 --> 20:05.256
But I want to see you again.

20:05.324 --> 20:07.492
How about right now?

20:07.560 --> 20:09.662
I stopped the meter.
We can start it again.

20:09.729 --> 20:11.632
It'll be like
I just picked you up.

20:11.699 --> 20:13.568
Will you please take a weak no?

20:15.640 --> 20:17.876
Let's see where
we are new year's eve.

20:17.943 --> 20:21.013
- If it's meant
to be, it'll keep.
- Let me walk you in.

20:21.081 --> 20:22.850
No.

20:22.918 --> 20:25.088
I know that trick.

20:48.456 --> 20:51.059
Waverly and 6th Avenue.

20:54.801 --> 20:57.071
I think you both really
acquitted yourselves well.

20:57.139 --> 21:00.309
She doesn't know when to stop.
You don't know when to stop.

21:00.376 --> 21:03.047
My objective
was to get the ham.

21:03.115 --> 21:04.783
No one told you to hit me.

21:04.851 --> 21:06.753
That wasn't part of it.

21:06.820 --> 21:10.091
The important thing is that...
oh, here's Mr. Campbell.

21:13.096 --> 21:15.666
I've been assured you ladies
can look for your names

21:15.734 --> 21:18.303
And perhaps your picture
in Monday's "daily news."

21:18.371 --> 21:21.742
- What section?
- It's the "daily news."
it's one big section.

21:23.412 --> 21:26.850
All in all,
not a bad way
to spend a Sunday.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.256
Can you go back to the market
and get me some aspirin?

21:31.324 --> 21:34.126
We probably shouldn't have any
more contact for the time being.

21:35.997 --> 21:37.465
<i>- ( pills rattle )
- shall we?</i>

21:42.172 --> 21:44.141
We really appreciate
your talent

21:44.208 --> 21:46.144
And of course, your discretion.

21:46.211 --> 21:47.746
- You hurt me.
- Ow ow ow!

21:47.814 --> 21:49.749
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

21:49.817 --> 21:53.321
- Daisy!
- Walk her to the train.

21:55.926 --> 21:57.228
- Are you okay, dear?
- Yeah.

21:58.865 --> 22:00.734
Let's get you in a cab.

22:05.576 --> 22:08.447
- Good morning.
- Welcome back.
How was Los Angeles?

22:08.515 --> 22:10.183
Very hard to leave.

22:10.251 --> 22:13.087
I would love a vacation.

22:13.155 --> 22:14.891
It wasn't a vacation.

22:14.958 --> 22:17.061
I had a lot of tsuris
with Lucy and Desi.

22:17.128 --> 22:19.064
Has someone been
using my office?

22:19.131 --> 22:20.833
Mr. Sterling doesn't
have a television.

22:20.901 --> 22:23.171
I'm calling
a meeting for 11:00.

22:23.239 --> 22:25.475
No, make it 1:00.
Do we have a table yet?

22:25.543 --> 22:27.712
1:30 and no.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.418
- Hi.
- Yes?

22:31.485 --> 22:33.588
<i>- Do you know where
the seacore rough cut is?
- Peggy: I got it!</i>

22:36.226 --> 22:38.896
Don't you want to know why?

22:38.964 --> 22:41.133
I sold the jai alai TV special.

22:41.201 --> 22:43.370
Really?

22:43.437 --> 22:45.239
A.B.C.
They're moving towards

22:45.307 --> 22:47.309
All these eccentric
sporting events... go-karts.

22:47.377 --> 22:49.680
Well, that's very exciting.

22:49.748 --> 22:51.750
Can you get someone to track
down a cup of coffee for me?

22:51.818 --> 22:53.887
And I'd love
a grapefruit juice.
And, Joan?

22:53.954 --> 22:57.559
- That is my news.
- I won't even tell people
after it's aired.

23:02.635 --> 23:04.102
Good morning,
Mr. Draper.

23:05.939 --> 23:08.141
Don, can I speak
with you for a minute?

23:15.186 --> 23:17.657
Morning.

23:17.725 --> 23:20.127
- Lane, would you
excuse us for a minute?
- Of course.

23:20.195 --> 23:22.030
Good morning, don.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.643
You know,

23:29.710 --> 23:32.247
No one who's ever been
associated with an actual event

23:32.314 --> 23:34.951
Has thought it's been portrayed
honestly in the newspaper.

23:38.892 --> 23:41.261
"Donald draper,
or don as he is known"

23:41.328 --> 23:44.566
Perhaps in an attempt
to appear humble,
is a handsome cipher.

23:46.570 --> 23:48.439
One imagines somewhere
in an attic

23:48.506 --> 23:50.709
"There's a painting of him
that's rapidly aging."

23:52.279 --> 23:54.281
For a guy from "ad age"
he can really write.

23:54.349 --> 23:56.885
- He also says you're married.
- Jesus.

23:56.953 --> 23:59.790
He never asked me that.
Did he check any facts?

23:59.858 --> 24:01.826
You didn't give him any facts.

24:01.894 --> 24:05.532
- He had to make
some assumptions.
- My job is to write ads,

24:05.600 --> 24:07.602
Not go around
talking about who I am.

24:07.670 --> 24:09.705
Who knows who you are?

24:09.773 --> 24:12.811
This was supposed to be
an advertisement for the firm.

24:12.879 --> 24:14.680
Why do you have so many copies?

24:14.748 --> 24:16.616
I bought one to read.

24:16.684 --> 24:19.454
I was going to buy one
to frame in reception,
and then I read it.

24:19.521 --> 24:21.925
I just wanted
to get them all
before anyone else did.

24:21.992 --> 24:24.028
It'll be lining bird cages
by Friday.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.465
This is a missed opportunity.

24:26.532 --> 24:29.403
You turned all the sizzle
from glo-coat into a wet fart.

24:29.471 --> 24:31.639
Plus you sound like a prick.

24:31.707 --> 24:33.709
Well, it's done.

24:34.945 --> 24:36.614
I learned a valuable lesson:

24:36.681 --> 24:38.683
Stay away from
one-legged reporters.

24:38.751 --> 24:40.419
Yeah, I was thinking
about that...

24:40.487 --> 24:42.856
Who is he to criticize anybody?

24:42.924 --> 24:46.929
Just so you
don't kill yourself,
there was some good news.

24:46.996 --> 24:48.932
Jane's friend found
you to be charming.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.768
Although a little
grabby in the car.

24:50.836 --> 24:53.205
That is good news.
Thank you.

24:53.273 --> 24:55.643
She liked you.
Maybe you should have
fondled peg-leg Pete.

24:55.711 --> 24:57.747
They raise you up
and they knock you down.

24:57.815 --> 25:00.183
I don't know what
I could have done differently.

25:00.251 --> 25:03.021
I believe that you were
being modest, but he didn't.

25:03.089 --> 25:05.525
I'm sorry, but after
the year you've had,

25:05.593 --> 25:07.461
It's just not
appropriate anymore.

25:12.637 --> 25:14.205
He's expecting us!

25:15.774 --> 25:18.378
- Is Joey coming?
- I'm here.

25:18.446 --> 25:21.550
- Oh.
- Why can't you come
to our office?

25:21.618 --> 25:24.820
- Do you want to hear what
sugarberry said or not?
- Shoot.

25:24.888 --> 25:28.192
It was uproarious.
First it's Darryl,
and he tells me about

25:28.260 --> 25:31.431
How they stared at
the article all day yesterday
worrying about a lawsuit.

25:31.498 --> 25:33.635
So I hang up and debate
whether or not to tell don...

25:33.702 --> 25:36.038
Throw myself on my sword.
And then Kreutzer calls

25:36.106 --> 25:38.141
<i>To tell me other papers
picked up the story.</i>

25:38.209 --> 25:40.345
<i>And I think,
"he knows it's us,"
but how could he?</i>

25:40.413 --> 25:43.883
And he said everyone,
especially Darryl,
was very excited.

25:43.951 --> 25:46.255
And then he gets Christian:

25:46.322 --> 25:48.491
He's sorry someone got hurt,

25:48.559 --> 25:50.661
But more people will
taste their ham now

25:50.729 --> 25:52.898
And they'll love it.
( chuckles )

25:52.966 --> 25:55.969
It's beautiful.
How do you put something
like this in your book?

25:56.037 --> 25:57.839
You can't.
We can't even
charge them.

25:57.907 --> 25:59.175
It wouldn't be a bad idea

25:59.243 --> 26:01.178
For them to increase
their media budget.

26:01.245 --> 26:03.681
- Seize the moment.
- With more crappy ads?

26:03.749 --> 26:05.917
- Hopefully not.
- You use it.

26:05.985 --> 26:09.756
The winner of
the ham battle is you.

26:09.824 --> 26:12.360
Can you imagine?
Lane's dentures would
drop out of his head

26:12.428 --> 26:14.029
If we came in
with an additional buy.

26:17.034 --> 26:19.604
"our hams are worth
fighting for."

26:21.809 --> 26:26.115
A cartoon pilgrim and an Indian
in a tug of war with the ham.

26:26.182 --> 26:28.985
Old ladies will smile.

26:29.053 --> 26:31.856
Why didn't you pitch
that two months ago?
It's good on its own.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.960
A slogan's nothing
when you have a good idea.

26:35.563 --> 26:37.598
Black crayon.
I need it in an hour.

26:37.666 --> 26:39.501
Chop chop, Joey.

26:41.772 --> 26:44.143
Clara, could you get Darryl
for me at sugarberry?

26:44.211 --> 26:47.180
Tell him it's urgent.
I may need you.

26:47.247 --> 26:49.016
( buzzes )

26:49.084 --> 26:51.286
<i>Horace cook, Jr.
It's urgent.</i>

26:52.523 --> 26:55.326
Ho-ho!
How was Tijuana?

26:55.394 --> 26:58.698
I have to say,
it's a very flattering
picture.

26:58.766 --> 27:01.670
And I don't think
I'd mind being
described that way.

27:01.737 --> 27:03.672
Mr. Crane,
you're a salesman.

27:03.740 --> 27:06.543
You do not want to be
known as mysterious.

27:06.611 --> 27:08.479
There'll be
no further discussion.

27:08.548 --> 27:10.984
I just got off
the phone with ho-ho.

27:11.052 --> 27:13.487
- Jai alai is leaving.
- What?

27:13.555 --> 27:17.326
- It's over.
- Bullshit. I just sold
a TV special to a.B.C.

27:17.394 --> 27:20.665
Well, apparently don didn't
mention them in the article.

27:22.469 --> 27:25.072
I didn't mention anyone.
That's the reporter's job.

27:28.044 --> 27:31.248
- Spectacular.
- What the hell's ho-ho
doing reading "ad age"?

27:31.316 --> 27:33.685
- Fix it.
- Todd got all the partners

27:33.753 --> 27:36.489
From c.G.C. To call and they
worked him up and down.

27:36.557 --> 27:38.025
They told him
we laugh about him.

27:38.093 --> 27:40.061
I don't!
Get him him on the phone,

27:40.129 --> 27:42.432
Get him in here
or camp out in his driveway.

27:42.500 --> 27:45.303
He hung up on me.

27:45.370 --> 27:48.041
I think he was crying.

27:49.777 --> 27:52.614
How much was left in
ho-ho anyway?

27:52.681 --> 27:55.652
We'll survive with jai alai
off our list.

27:55.719 --> 27:57.988
We will survive,
but for how long?

27:58.056 --> 27:59.557
The loss of jai alai

27:59.625 --> 28:02.594
Makes lucky strike
71% of our billings.

28:02.662 --> 28:04.797
It's an untenably
insecure position.

28:07.870 --> 28:10.940
Harry, why don't you call
and pretend like you don't
know any of this.

28:11.008 --> 28:13.343
Give it an hour
so he'll take the call.

28:13.411 --> 28:15.981
I wish we really had
a second floor so I could
jump off it.

28:24.631 --> 28:27.535
I'm going to have to get
you another interview.

28:27.603 --> 28:30.940
"the wall street journal."

28:31.007 --> 28:32.876
And what do I do differently?

28:32.944 --> 28:34.913
I told him the truth.

28:34.981 --> 28:37.717
Who gives a crap
what I say anyway?
My work speaks for me.

28:37.785 --> 28:41.557
Turning creative success
into business is your work.

28:41.624 --> 28:44.261
And you've failed.

28:52.642 --> 28:54.711
It'll pass.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.862
- Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

29:05.930 --> 29:07.632
We started without you.

29:07.699 --> 29:10.102
Oh, grandma Pauline,
I told you mother's
was at noon.

29:10.170 --> 29:12.573
- We already ate.
- You're supposed to overeat
on Thanksgiving.

29:12.641 --> 29:14.844
Ooh, thank you.

29:14.911 --> 29:17.480
Jamie, you'll have something?

29:17.548 --> 29:20.218
We missed dessert.

29:20.286 --> 29:22.721
You're next to your father.

29:22.789 --> 29:25.759
- Put up some coffee, dear.
- Hi, daddy.

29:25.827 --> 29:27.695
Isn't that sweet?

29:29.466 --> 29:31.601
We didn't forget you.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.409
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

29:36.476 --> 29:38.145
- Thanks.
- After you eat.

29:41.652 --> 29:43.620
The traffic was simply murder.

29:43.688 --> 29:46.325
That's because that's
what's become of this country.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.762
Everyone has two
thanksgivings to go to.

29:48.830 --> 29:52.201
Maybe we have twice as much
to be thankful for.

29:58.577 --> 30:00.779
Don't you like the food, dear?

30:00.847 --> 30:03.517
- No.
- Sally draper, that's rude.

30:03.585 --> 30:07.122
- You love cranberry sauce.
- It has seeds in it.

30:07.190 --> 30:09.893
- How about the sweet potato?
- I'm not hungry.

30:09.960 --> 30:13.264
Look, there's marshmallow.

30:17.972 --> 30:19.440
- ( coughing )
- oh lord.

30:19.508 --> 30:20.943
( gagging )

30:23.014 --> 30:25.817
She might have a fever.

30:25.885 --> 30:28.187
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, dear.

30:28.255 --> 30:31.993
<i>- Isabel, can you bring a rag?
- Sally: Ow, stop pinching me!</i>

30:32.061 --> 30:33.796
<i>( door closes )</i>

30:38.003 --> 30:40.672
I love sweet potatoes.

30:40.740 --> 30:43.075
( chuckles )

30:45.379 --> 30:47.648
<i>- Isabel!
- ( knocks )</i>

30:49.719 --> 30:51.554
Happy Thanksgiving.

30:58.499 --> 31:01.102
- Do you want a drink?
- I don't have much time.

31:01.170 --> 31:03.340
- I have supper
with my family.
- Oh.

31:03.408 --> 31:06.345
- Of course you do.
- Should I not have
mentioned my family?

31:06.412 --> 31:08.348
I never know how
you're going to react.

31:08.416 --> 31:10.285
No, that's fine.

31:21.236 --> 31:24.107
- Let me take off my brassiere.
- No. In a minute.

31:24.175 --> 31:26.743
Stop telling me what to do.
I know what you want.

31:26.811 --> 31:29.347
So do it.

31:32.654 --> 31:34.188
Harder.

31:36.526 --> 31:37.860
Again.

31:41.367 --> 31:44.036
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

31:47.944 --> 31:49.946
<i>( ringing stops )</i>

31:50.013 --> 31:53.185
Hold on.

31:58.027 --> 32:00.263
Surprise, it's for you.

32:03.869 --> 32:06.105
Why did you answer it?

32:06.173 --> 32:08.175
It was the third try.
I couldn't take it.

32:12.148 --> 32:14.952
- Hello?
- Happy Thanksgiving.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.122
Happy Thanksgiving.

32:17.190 --> 32:20.127
I'm sorry to bother you.
I didn't know you'd have guests.

32:20.194 --> 32:22.363
What's wrong?

32:22.431 --> 32:25.667
I need $280 for bail.

32:25.734 --> 32:28.538
- ( clears throat )
- ( softly ) bye.

32:28.606 --> 32:31.743
- Where are you?
- It... it's not for me.

32:36.050 --> 32:38.619
Spit it out, honey.

32:38.686 --> 32:41.557
You're going to laugh.

32:41.624 --> 32:43.059
( clears throat )

32:43.127 --> 32:45.128
Pete and I hired some actresses

32:45.196 --> 32:48.333
To get in a fight
over a sugarberry ham.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.569
<i>You know, as a stunt.</i>

32:50.637 --> 32:52.972
We got them to increase
their media budget.

32:54.543 --> 32:56.178
Hello?

32:56.246 --> 32:58.148
I'm here.

32:58.216 --> 33:01.185
Well, one of them pressed
charges against the other

33:01.253 --> 33:03.323
For assault.
It's $80 bail

33:03.390 --> 33:05.626
And $100 apiece to keep
their mouths shut.

33:05.694 --> 33:08.196
And it has to happen today.

33:08.264 --> 33:10.166
Call Pete!

33:11.737 --> 33:13.472
Do you think
you're my first call?

33:17.378 --> 33:19.781
Hello.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

33:19.849 --> 33:22.152
- I oughta let you
Twist in the wind.
- It still worked out.

33:22.220 --> 33:24.690
- You'll be very happy.
- I'm not happy.

33:24.757 --> 33:26.993
And I don't think
it's funny or cute.

33:27.061 --> 33:29.063
You run something
like that by me first.

33:29.131 --> 33:31.233
I would have kept you
from looking like an idiot,

33:31.301 --> 33:33.403
Or worse yet,
making me look like one.
Is that what you want?

33:35.006 --> 33:36.774
You want people to think
we're idiots, Peggy?

33:36.842 --> 33:39.478
Hey, there's no reason
for name-calling.

33:39.546 --> 33:42.315
- She's been agonizing.
- Who are you?

33:42.383 --> 33:44.585
I'm her fiance.

33:44.654 --> 33:46.989
Mark, don't.

33:47.057 --> 33:50.060
Why'd you bring him
up here if you didn't
want him involved?

33:50.127 --> 33:53.899
I know.
I'm sorry, don.

33:57.941 --> 34:00.077
- Fiance?
- It just came out.

34:07.657 --> 34:10.694
- Did you put the dog out?
- It's cold outside.

34:10.762 --> 34:12.464
But I locked her
in the laundry room.

34:18.808 --> 34:20.810
It's not cold in here.

34:26.518 --> 34:28.621
<i>( rattling )</i>

34:28.688 --> 34:30.656
<i>( phone dialing )</i>

34:35.130 --> 34:37.268
Sally.

34:37.335 --> 34:40.172
I was calling daddy.

34:40.239 --> 34:42.811
Hello?

34:42.879 --> 34:45.181
I wanted to wish him
a happy Thanksgiving.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.485
You'll see him tomorrow.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.822
You want to call him
to complain about
how awful I am?

34:49.889 --> 34:53.495
Don't expect any sympathy when
he hears my side of the story.

34:53.563 --> 34:55.331
- Don't!
- Go to bed.

35:02.110 --> 35:05.246
( sighs )
I'm going to have them take
that phone out of the hallway.

35:05.315 --> 35:06.882
Mmm.

35:14.461 --> 35:16.698
Tomorrow when the kids go,

35:16.766 --> 35:19.902
Why don't we have Carla
take the baby and we'll
drive to a nice dinner?

35:21.973 --> 35:23.742
Maybe Essex.

35:23.809 --> 35:25.544
The Griswold inn.

35:27.850 --> 35:29.217
Okay.

35:33.791 --> 35:35.493
I'm really full, Betty.

35:41.385 --> 35:42.954
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

- I ate everything.

Hello.

36:02.853 --> 36:05.356
- 9:00 tomorrow night.
- Where's the baby?

36:05.424 --> 36:07.894
I had Carla take him.
You weren't going to.

36:07.962 --> 36:10.297
- Henry and I have plans.
- I'd like to see him.

36:12.970 --> 36:15.005
- Hello, don.
- Henry.

36:15.073 --> 36:17.875
Come on, let's go.

36:35.537 --> 36:37.406
Garage door.

36:42.314 --> 36:45.885
- What are you doing?
- You know what I'm doing.

36:54.030 --> 36:57.401
The button fell off my pajamas.

36:57.468 --> 36:59.270
I'll sew it on in the morning.

36:59.338 --> 37:00.939
You know how to sew?

37:01.007 --> 37:03.242
I can do a button.
I'll show you.

37:09.454 --> 37:10.988
I'll leave the light on
in the bathroom

37:11.056 --> 37:12.892
So there won't be
any more problems, okay?

37:12.960 --> 37:15.530
- Okay.
- Good night, daddy.

For what?

Oh.

39:10.543 --> 39:12.846
It's almost 10:00.

- I thought you said 10:00.
- She didn't.

39:15.752 --> 39:17.387
I've waited for you
plenty of times.

39:17.455 --> 39:20.324
Henry, do you mind?

39:20.392 --> 39:23.463
- Betty?
- It's okay.

39:23.531 --> 39:25.333
Does that mean I should stay
or not stay?

39:25.400 --> 39:26.669
Stay.

When are you moving out?

You were supposed
to be out a month ago.

We haven't found the right
place for the kids.

39:39.390 --> 39:42.627
Well, either do as we agreed
or I'm going to need
to collect rent.

39:42.695 --> 39:45.899
- What?
- Or you could just buy it
from me if you want to.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.769
I can't believe you.

You're not even looking.

40:17.278 --> 40:19.680
There's nothing out there,
and he doesn't decide.

40:24.855 --> 40:26.590
( sighs )

40:30.330 --> 40:32.733
<i>- ( intercom buzzes )
- miss Olson is here
to see you.</i>

40:37.943 --> 40:39.846
Send her in.

40:45.456 --> 40:47.191
They sent one for each of us.

40:49.429 --> 40:51.664
Could have just as easily
fired us.

40:51.732 --> 40:54.904
But they didn't
because they sold
more hams.

40:54.971 --> 40:57.942
And now you get
to tell them why,
if you want.

40:58.009 --> 40:59.277
I think they'll be impressed.

41:01.315 --> 41:02.416
Well, I'm not.

41:04.488 --> 41:06.823
I try and stay away from
these kinds of shenanigans.

41:06.891 --> 41:09.193
But I guess you knew that
or you would have told me.

41:09.260 --> 41:12.831
It was going great
until it wasn't.

41:12.899 --> 41:15.236
Thanks for the ham.

41:16.938 --> 41:18.673
I should have told you.

41:20.911 --> 41:23.013
Since when do you
have a fiance?

41:23.081 --> 41:24.983
I don't.

41:26.954 --> 41:29.323
But you didn't have
to do that that way.

41:29.390 --> 41:32.295
You brought him with you
because you thought I
wouldn't embarrass you.

41:32.362 --> 41:34.131
At least I'm thinking ahead.

41:34.199 --> 41:36.769
Doesn't always work, does it?

41:39.174 --> 41:42.545
You need to think
a little bit more about
the image of this agency.

41:42.613 --> 41:45.350
Well, nobody knows
about the ham stunt,

41:45.418 --> 41:49.257
So our image remains
pretty much where
you left it.

41:49.325 --> 41:52.528
I won't need you in
the Jantzen presentation.

41:52.596 --> 41:55.399
- Now you're being spiteful.
- No.

41:55.467 --> 41:58.036
I just think it would
be better not to have
a girl in the room.

42:01.743 --> 42:03.611
You know something?

42:03.679 --> 42:05.514
We are all here because of you.

42:07.418 --> 42:09.688
All we want to do
is please you.

42:18.301 --> 42:20.202
Why don't I put them
in the pantry?

42:20.270 --> 42:22.105
Christmas is around the corner.

42:22.173 --> 42:25.310
<i>Pauline:
Put them in the basement.</i>

42:25.378 --> 42:27.874
Did the children
like their gifts?

42:27.942 --> 42:29.543
They did.

42:32.916 --> 42:35.887
It's nice the holiday is
memorable in some other way.

42:35.955 --> 42:39.058
I'm sorry a little girl
spoiled your Thanksgiving.

42:39.832 --> 42:41.233
Next time I'll tell her
not to get sick.

42:41.268 --> 42:43.387
I've raised children
in my life, Henry.

42:43.455 --> 42:45.757
They're terrified of her.

42:45.825 --> 42:48.160
You don't know
any of the people
you're talking about.

42:48.228 --> 42:50.163
Well, I know
what you see in her.

42:50.231 --> 42:53.102
And you could have gotten it
without marrying.

42:53.169 --> 42:55.672
Why can't you
give her a chance?

42:55.739 --> 42:59.444
- She loves you.
- She's a silly woman.

42:59.512 --> 43:01.647
Honestly, Henry,

43:01.715 --> 43:04.252
I don't know how you can stand
living in that man's dirt.

43:13.199 --> 43:15.469
<i>Don:
You go to the swimming pool,
you go to the beach,</i>

43:15.537 --> 43:17.806
<i>Take off your robe,
you head into the cabana.</i>

43:17.874 --> 43:22.018
<i>There's no other way
to slice it, you're
getting undressed.</i>

43:22.515 --> 43:23.763
Can I put my feet on this?

43:24.054 --> 43:25.176
- Pretend like
it's your living room.
- Thank you.

43:26.746 --> 43:30.083
What separates a bathing suit
from underwear?

43:30.150 --> 43:32.621
The cut and the print
of the cloth

43:33.273 --> 43:35.138
and some sort of
gentlemen's agreement.

43:42.277 --> 43:43.224
"so well built,

43:43.292 --> 43:45.462
We can't show you
the second floor."

43:54.209 --> 43:56.812
I think that's
a little suggestive.

43:56.880 --> 43:59.516
Good. That's what
I was going for.

43:59.584 --> 44:01.853
A wink, but it's not a leer.

44:01.921 --> 44:04.391
We don't want a wink.

44:04.458 --> 44:07.930
I think I explained
our product is for
modest people.

44:07.997 --> 44:10.733
Modest people want
to be stimulated too.

44:10.801 --> 44:12.570
This draws them in in a way

44:12.637 --> 44:15.073
That will make your competitors
seem crude and obvious.

44:15.463 --> 44:17.327
Plus they'll be dying
to see the suit.

44:17.503 --> 44:18.758
They'll be dying
to see the girl.

44:18.991 --> 44:21.897
And for all we know
she's not even wearing a top.

44:22.569 --> 44:23.641
You'll get them into the store.

44:24.892 --> 44:25.755
Isn't that the point?

44:26.972 --> 44:28.324
It's not wholesome.

44:29.117 --> 44:32.358
It's not...
did I tell you we're
a family company?

44:32.695 --> 44:33.847
I think I know what
you're looking for.

44:34.414 --> 44:36.883
A couple of women
bouncing a beach ball,

44:36.951 --> 44:39.086
Little girl in front of them
building a sandcastle.

44:41.123 --> 44:43.192
Your competitors are
gonna keep killing you

44:43.260 --> 44:45.195
Because you're too scared
of the skin

44:45.263 --> 44:47.933
That your two-piece
was designed to show off.

44:48.001 --> 44:51.472
Well, it's somehow dirtier

44:51.540 --> 44:54.042
Not seeing anything.

44:54.110 --> 44:56.612
You need to decide what kind
of company you want to be...

44:56.681 --> 45:00.619
Comfortable and dead
or risky and possibly rich.

45:00.687 --> 45:02.856
All I know is
we don't want that.

45:05.027 --> 45:07.931
Well, gentlemen,
you were wondering what
a creative agency looks like,

45:07.999 --> 45:10.067
There you have it.

45:10.135 --> 45:12.704
Hope you enjoyed
looking in the window.

45:12.772 --> 45:14.707
Give me a minute.

45:17.480 --> 45:19.448
Where are you going?

45:19.516 --> 45:21.685
Control yourself.

45:21.753 --> 45:23.988
Now cool off.

45:24.056 --> 45:27.394
Hopefully Campbell can talk
them into hearing a few more
ideas in a week or so.

45:27.461 --> 45:29.196
What?
No.

45:29.264 --> 45:31.033
That's not the point.

45:33.203 --> 45:34.505
Out.
Get out.

45:34.572 --> 45:35.973
- Don.
- Excuse me?

45:36.041 --> 45:38.310
Get your things and get out
of my office now.

45:39.981 --> 45:41.648
- Come on, let's go.
- ( snaps fingers )

45:50.063 --> 45:52.432
Call Bert Cooper's man
at "the wall street journal."

45:53.835 --> 45:55.904
<i>( slams door )</i>

45:59.977 --> 46:02.013
There's always a name
in every partnership

46:02.081 --> 46:03.816
That defines who they are.

46:03.883 --> 46:06.086
In the case of sterling
Cooper draper Pryce

46:06.154 --> 46:08.090
Would you say
that's Donald draper?

46:08.157 --> 46:10.827
Yes.

46:10.894 --> 46:13.030
Really?

46:13.098 --> 46:16.368
Last year our agency
was being swallowed whole.

46:16.436 --> 46:18.839
I realized I had two choices.

46:18.906 --> 46:21.643
I could die of boredom

46:21.711 --> 46:23.546
Or holster up my guns.

46:25.417 --> 46:28.153
So I walked into lane Pryce's
office and I said,

46:28.221 --> 46:29.956
"fire us."

46:33.696 --> 46:37.000
Two days later
we were operating out
of the Pierre hotel.

46:37.068 --> 46:40.539
Within a year we had
taken over two floors
of the time-life building.
