WEBVTT

00:02.110 --> 00:04.578
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

00:05.313 --> 00:06.871
Now you're telling me
you're a machine.

00:07.014 --> 00:08.003
The robot.

00:08.082 --> 00:11.017
You knew I wanted access
to the defense mainframe.

00:11.085 --> 00:14.452
Do you have any idea what they
will do to me if they find out?

00:14.522 --> 00:15.784
Get down.

00:16.991 --> 00:19.425
<i>Moments ago,
this ship received word...</i>

00:19.494 --> 00:22.952
<i>of a Cylon attack against
our home worlds is underway.</i>

00:23.030 --> 00:26.124
As of this moment,
we are at war.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.259
All right,
we can take three more people.

00:28.736 --> 00:30.397
Giving up my seat.

00:35.810 --> 00:38.802
I've decided you're an expression
of my subconscious mind...

00:38.880 --> 00:41.314
playing itself out
during my waking states.

00:41.382 --> 00:43.942
So I'm only in your head?

00:47.321 --> 00:48.345
No.

00:48.422 --> 00:50.982
There may be Cylon agents
living among us.

00:51.058 --> 00:53.390
Some may not even know
they're Cylons at all.

00:53.461 --> 00:54.826
<i>They could be
sleeper agents...</i>

00:54.896 --> 00:58.889
<i>programmed to perfectly impersonate
human beings until activation.</i>

02:25.253 --> 02:29.656
God has a plan for you, Gaius. He has
a plan for everything and everyone.

02:35.730 --> 02:38.221
Gaius?
Are you even listening to me?

02:43.804 --> 02:45.738
<i>Passengers,
30 seconds to mark.</i>

02:49.243 --> 02:53.145
You know what? Do this after the
jump. It's all right. Go ahead.

03:06.427 --> 03:08.759
You have to
believe in something.

03:10.631 --> 03:13.862
I believe in a world
that I can and do understand.

03:13.968 --> 03:17.665
A rational universe explained
through rational means.

03:24.545 --> 03:27.742
I love you.
That's not rational.

03:30.351 --> 03:31.545
I know.

03:33.220 --> 03:36.587
No, but you're not rational.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.887
You're also not really here.

03:43.664 --> 03:45.131
Neither am I.

03:46.867 --> 03:48.892
<i>Madam President,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

03:48.969 --> 03:51.130
<i>our 33 minutes
are almost up once again.</i>

03:51.205 --> 03:54.732
<i>Please prepare for our
faster-than-light jump. Thank you.</i>

04:01.248 --> 04:04.149
Cutting it a little close
this time, aren't we, Billy?

04:04.218 --> 04:07.585
Pilot says they've had to
reboot the FTL computer again.

04:11.525 --> 04:14.085
Why do the Cylons
come every 33 minutes?

04:14.161 --> 04:15.924
Why isn't it 34, 35...

04:15.996 --> 04:17.020
Cally.

04:17.098 --> 04:18.190
What?

04:19.033 --> 04:20.261
Shut up.

04:24.038 --> 04:25.403
15 seconds.

04:27.274 --> 04:31.040
Sir, jump 237 underway.
53 ships have jumped.

04:31.112 --> 04:33.603
10 still reporting trouble
with their FTL drives...

04:33.681 --> 04:35.581
<i>including Colonial One.</i>

04:36.016 --> 04:37.813
We're getting slower.

04:40.254 --> 04:41.846
Maybe this time.

05:04.712 --> 05:06.475
Dradis contact.

05:06.881 --> 05:08.473
It's the Cylons.

05:08.983 --> 05:09.972
Damn it.

05:10.050 --> 05:11.950
Not this time, maybe the next.

05:13.654 --> 05:15.519
I got another idea
for the next cycle.

05:15.589 --> 05:16.715
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

05:16.791 --> 05:18.622
<i>I'm afraid the Cylons
have appeared again.</i>

05:18.692 --> 05:22.753
<i>However, our FTL drive is now
working and we will jump momentarily.</i>

05:24.465 --> 05:26.228
Five days now.

05:30.805 --> 05:32.534
There are limits...

05:33.340 --> 05:35.740
to the human body,
the human mind.

05:36.677 --> 05:39.271
Tolerances
that you can't push beyond.

05:42.016 --> 05:43.677
Those are facts...

05:45.052 --> 05:46.576
provable facts.

05:49.123 --> 05:51.114
Everyone has their limit.

05:51.625 --> 05:55.026
All right, you know the drill,
people. Scatter formation.

05:55.095 --> 05:56.426
<i>Keep them off the civies</i>

05:56.497 --> 05:59.227
<i>and don't stray
beyond the recovery line.</i>

06:03.170 --> 06:05.035
Watch the ammo hoists
for the main guns.

06:05.105 --> 06:07.335
You've got a red light
right there.

06:11.212 --> 06:12.941
We have a hit
on the starboard bow.

06:13.013 --> 06:15.038
Away
the damage control parties.

06:15.115 --> 06:17.345
Basestar is launching raiders.

06:28.696 --> 06:30.926
<i>Colonial One is ready to jump.</i>

06:35.769 --> 06:38.169
<i>All civilian ships away,
including Colonial One.</i>

06:38.239 --> 06:40.639
Recover fighters.
Stand by to jump.

06:40.708 --> 06:42.300
Combat landings.

06:49.283 --> 06:50.511
All fighters aboard, sir.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.051
Execute jump.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.572
Jump 237 complete.

07:14.842 --> 07:17.470
All civilian ships present
and accounted for, sir.

07:17.545 --> 07:19.137
Start the clock.

07:19.380 --> 07:22.213
And let's start prepping
for the next jump.

07:22.349 --> 07:25.045
Clock is running. 33 minutes.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.412
Mark.

07:32.159 --> 07:34.218
You got 32 minutes, people.

07:59.553 --> 08:01.544
You know you're not safe.

08:02.890 --> 08:04.551
No, of course not.

08:05.426 --> 08:07.826
The Cylons
will follow us again...

08:08.862 --> 08:11.558
as they have
the last 237 times.

08:14.602 --> 08:17.332
You're right, you know.
There are limits.

08:17.771 --> 08:19.500
Eventually,
you'll make a mistake.

08:19.573 --> 08:21.700
And then you'll kill us all.

08:21.842 --> 08:22.900
Yes.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.076
Yes, I know.

08:26.580 --> 08:28.810
But not for
another 33 minutes.

10:02.442 --> 10:05.377
I want to try
something new this time.

10:11.117 --> 10:14.143
Divide the fleet
into six groups.

10:16.456 --> 10:17.787
Then they jump...

10:19.325 --> 10:23.056
Then they jump two more times and on
the fourth jump, we rendezvous at...

10:23.129 --> 10:25.256
a common set of coordinates.

10:26.733 --> 10:30.669
24 jumps to plot,
we're breaking our humps...

10:30.770 --> 10:33.967
calculating one jump
every 33 minutes.

10:35.007 --> 10:36.668
Get off my jacket.

10:36.809 --> 10:38.003
Are you eating this?

10:38.544 --> 10:39.943
Not anymore.

10:41.214 --> 10:45.480
Combat landings expected
again to be the order of the day...

10:47.420 --> 10:50.355
so double-check
your undercarriage before...

10:55.728 --> 10:59.095
Look, you've all done this
237 times.

11:01.067 --> 11:02.830
You know what to do.

11:03.770 --> 11:05.169
No mistakes.

11:06.072 --> 11:08.063
And let's make it to 238.

11:10.676 --> 11:13.304
And good luck
and be careful out there.

11:33.166 --> 11:36.761
Can you do me a favor? Tell
Capt. Apollo he owes me one wing.

11:36.836 --> 11:38.736
You got it, Chief.

11:39.939 --> 11:42.772
No, Cally, there's three.
I know there's three.

11:42.842 --> 11:44.434
Can you check it again
for me, please?

11:44.510 --> 11:45.534
Yeah.

11:45.611 --> 11:48.273
At least get some of them
starting to work.

11:48.714 --> 11:50.614
We'll sleep when we're dead.
Come on.

11:51.150 --> 11:52.344
Boomer.

11:53.519 --> 11:55.680
Heard the latest? They say
Cylons look like us now.

11:56.856 --> 11:58.323
Primary fuel?

11:58.457 --> 12:00.482
Primary fuel 2893 KRG.

12:00.560 --> 12:04.189
Marine told one of the pilots that
we marooned some guy back on Ragnar...

12:04.263 --> 12:06.424
because they actually thought
that he was a Cylon.

12:06.499 --> 12:09.059
You know what?
I don't give a frak.

12:09.769 --> 12:11.464
Red light on
the number four thruster.

12:11.537 --> 12:14.267
Go make a visual ID.
See if it's blocked.

12:14.507 --> 12:15.667
Right.

12:16.142 --> 12:17.302
Right.

12:30.823 --> 12:33.155
A little rough on your
new ECO, don't you think?

12:33.226 --> 12:34.818
He's not my ECO.

12:34.961 --> 12:39.694
He's some refugee from Triton that I've
been saddled with and I didn't ask you.

12:44.036 --> 12:45.469
Helo's gone, Sharon.

12:45.538 --> 12:47.768
I didn't ask you that, either.

12:52.645 --> 12:53.805
Sorry.

12:58.084 --> 12:59.244
Colony?

12:59.318 --> 13:01.013
Saggitaron.
How many have you got?

13:01.087 --> 13:04.250
5,251 survivors
from Saggitaron, last count.

13:06.559 --> 13:10.154
We can't transmit photos yet. If you
want, you can leave them with us...

13:10.229 --> 13:12.959
or you can put them
on the board outside.

13:13.199 --> 13:14.359
Sorry.

13:14.967 --> 13:16.161
Thanks.

13:16.669 --> 13:17.761
Next.

13:21.307 --> 13:22.501
Colony?

14:07.553 --> 14:10.283
Update on the headcount,
Madam President.

14:19.298 --> 14:21.061
How did we lose 300?

14:21.934 --> 14:24.164
There were some over counts...

14:24.837 --> 14:29.103
a few deaths from wounds and a
few missing during the last attack.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.607
Do you want children, Gaius?

15:13.552 --> 15:16.077
Let me think about that
for a minute.

15:17.356 --> 15:18.380
No.

15:21.193 --> 15:24.094
Procreation
is one of God's commandments.

15:24.830 --> 15:26.024
Really?

15:27.400 --> 15:30.335
I'm sure someday, if you're a
good Cylon, he'll reward you...

15:30.403 --> 15:33.770
with a lovely little walking
toaster of your very own.

15:34.173 --> 15:37.108
I want us
to have a child, Gaius.

15:37.610 --> 15:38.872
You can't be serious.

15:39.779 --> 15:41.144
It's Dr. Amarak.

15:41.213 --> 15:42.703
What was that?

15:48.921 --> 15:53.290
I'm so sorry for interrupting
you while you were speaking.

15:53.726 --> 15:55.523
You were just saying?

15:57.630 --> 16:00.827
I was just saying
that a Dr. Amarak...

16:01.267 --> 16:03.064
had requested
to speak with the President.

16:03.135 --> 16:04.796
Dr. Amarak. I see.

16:06.005 --> 16:07.336
You know him?

16:07.406 --> 16:09.738
Have you always been able
to multitask like this?

16:09.809 --> 16:11.071
Yes. Yes.

16:12.044 --> 16:15.309
I used to work with him
at the Ministry of Defense.

16:16.048 --> 16:19.745
It says here that he's uncovered
important information...

16:19.819 --> 16:23.482
regarding how the Cylons were
able to defeat colonial defenses.

16:23.556 --> 16:25.615
I was always a little worried
he was on to us.

16:25.691 --> 16:27.522
Were you going
to speak to him?

16:27.593 --> 16:30.528
Perhaps I should speak to him
if you're busy.

16:31.097 --> 16:34.726
Actually, I think he wanted to
speak directly with the President.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.461
It sounded urgent.

16:37.636 --> 16:39.661
It must be very important.

16:41.040 --> 16:44.942
Maybe something about a certain
traitor in the President's inner circle?

16:45.010 --> 16:46.671
There's not enough time
before we jump.

16:46.745 --> 16:50.112
I want him on board first
thing during the next cycle.

16:50.516 --> 16:52.177
Thank you, Doctor.

16:55.087 --> 16:57.317
I'd say you have
a serious problem.

16:57.389 --> 16:58.879
If I can help.

17:05.364 --> 17:07.559
He's a strange one, isn't he?

18:44.862 --> 18:47.057
<i>Landing Bay, Team Alpha...</i>

18:47.131 --> 18:48.655
Did you see it?

18:50.435 --> 18:54.098
Twelve more cases of nervous
exhaustion. That makes 61.

18:54.906 --> 18:58.364
Have the docs start pumpin'
them up with stimulants...

18:58.576 --> 19:00.203
and get them back on the line.

19:00.278 --> 19:01.267
Pilots, too.

19:01.346 --> 19:02.370
Fuel report.

19:02.447 --> 19:04.711
One out of every three,
every other cycle.

19:04.782 --> 19:07.910
That's going to come back
and bite us in the ass.

19:07.986 --> 19:10.386
We have too much work and
not enough people to do it.

19:10.455 --> 19:12.218
Fuel report.

19:12.857 --> 19:14.188
I've already signed
one of these.

19:14.259 --> 19:15.590
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

19:15.660 --> 19:18.094
Comm traffic two
from the President.

19:18.162 --> 19:19.891
Is this my 10 minutes
or this yours?

19:19.964 --> 19:22.057
Yours. I took 10 last time.

19:23.901 --> 19:26.028
I'll see you guys in combat.

19:26.237 --> 19:27.966
I believe
it was your 10 minutes.

19:28.039 --> 19:31.941
If the old man's so tired he
can't remember, then it's his turn.

19:38.149 --> 19:39.844
You see the note
from the XO?

19:39.917 --> 19:41.817
Yeah, I saw it. No way.

19:43.388 --> 19:44.582
Kara, everyone else...

19:44.656 --> 19:45.816
- I don't fly with stims.

19:45.890 --> 19:48.825
They blunt your reflexes,
your reaction time.

19:49.694 --> 19:51.355
Come on, Kara,
give me a break. Just...

19:51.429 --> 19:53.624
Why are we arguing
about this?

19:53.998 --> 19:55.192
I have no idea.

19:55.266 --> 19:57.393
Neither do I.
You're the CAG, act like one.

19:57.468 --> 19:59.663
What the hell does that mean?

20:00.171 --> 20:03.436
It means that you're still acting
like you're everyone's best friend.

20:03.508 --> 20:05.908
We're not friends,
you're the CAG.

20:06.177 --> 20:07.940
"Be careful out there"?

20:08.012 --> 20:12.176
Our job isn't to be careful, it's to
shoot Cylons out of the frakking sky.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.377
"Good hunting"
is what you say.

20:14.452 --> 20:17.285
And now, one of your idiot
pilots is acting like a child...

20:17.355 --> 20:20.586
and refusing to take her pills.
So she either says, "Yes, sir"...

20:20.658 --> 20:23.456
and obeys a direct order or
you smack her in the mouth...

20:23.528 --> 20:28.124
and you drag her sorry ass down to
sickbay and you make her take those pills.

20:33.071 --> 20:35.699
Well, I'm glad
I'm not working for you.

20:37.508 --> 20:39.738
You're damn right you're glad.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.407
So, do I have to smack you
in the mouth, Lieutenant?

20:49.120 --> 20:51.247
No, sir. I'll take my pills.

20:53.491 --> 20:54.719
Perfect.

20:57.362 --> 20:58.624
Carry on.

20:59.330 --> 21:00.422
Yes, sir.

21:00.498 --> 21:02.898
<i>Pilots to ready
room for pre-flight briefing.</i>

21:02.967 --> 21:04.764
<i>Pilots to ready room.</i>

21:09.107 --> 21:10.199
What?

22:10.601 --> 22:12.535
Jump 238 complete.

22:12.603 --> 22:14.195
Start the clock.

22:15.273 --> 22:16.638
33 minutes.

22:17.975 --> 22:19.067
Mark.

22:20.545 --> 22:22.911
All civilian ships
present and...

22:24.248 --> 22:25.772
Strike my last.

22:26.083 --> 22:29.314
One civilian ship missing
and unaccounted for, sir.

22:29.387 --> 22:30.445
Which one?

22:30.521 --> 22:33.684
<i>The Olympic Carrier.
Commercial passenger vessel.</i>

22:33.891 --> 22:35.722
Were they left behind?

22:35.793 --> 22:38.159
I think I accounted for all
civilian ships before we left.

22:38.229 --> 22:40.561
You think?
Did you or didn't you?

22:43.835 --> 22:47.896
They're not logged in, sir. I think
they may have been left behind.

22:48.573 --> 22:50.700
How many people aboard ship?

22:50.942 --> 22:54.309
1,345 souls, sir.

22:56.614 --> 23:01.051
You're telling me we left over 1,300
people to die at the hands of the Cylons?

23:01.118 --> 23:03.211
It may not have been
her fault, sir.

23:03.287 --> 23:05.312
It may have simply been
a navigational error...

23:05.389 --> 23:07.220
and they jumped
to the wrong coordinates...

23:07.291 --> 23:09.384
or the Cylons destroyed the
ship before they jumped...

23:09.460 --> 23:11.155
Or 50 other things
may have happened.

23:11.229 --> 23:14.528
The point is we don't know
what the hell did happen.

23:19.804 --> 23:22.705
Yes, we're tired.
Yes, there's no relief.

23:23.341 --> 23:27.334
Yes, the Cylons keep coming after
us time after time after time...

23:27.979 --> 23:31.574
and yes, we are still expected
to do our jobs.

23:41.425 --> 23:43.620
We make mistakes, people die.

23:46.564 --> 23:48.759
There aren't many of us left.

23:53.170 --> 23:54.432
Carry on.

24:23.935 --> 24:27.166
Okay. Next crisis?

24:31.309 --> 24:32.298
List of calls?

24:32.376 --> 24:33.434
Yes.

24:34.946 --> 24:38.382
But first, where's the doctor
that's supposed to be on board?

24:38.449 --> 24:40.007
What's his name?

24:40.084 --> 24:41.142
Dr. Amarak.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.276
Yes.

24:43.788 --> 24:45.153
Dr. Amarak.

24:50.828 --> 24:51.852
Oh.

24:53.664 --> 24:54.961
<i>He was on the Olympic Carrier.</i>

25:02.406 --> 25:04.840
God is watching out for you,
Gaius.

25:09.847 --> 25:12.645
The universe is a vast
and complex system.

25:13.818 --> 25:17.618
Coincidental,
serendipitous events...

25:17.688 --> 25:19.815
are bound to occur. Indeed
they are to be expected.

25:19.890 --> 25:21.721
It's part of the pattern,
part of the plan.

25:21.792 --> 25:24.124
Dr. Amarak
posed a threat to you.

25:24.929 --> 25:27.989
Now he's gone. Logic says
there's a connection.

25:30.001 --> 25:32.993
A connection, maybe.
But not God.

25:34.705 --> 25:38.641
There is no God or gods,
singular or plural.

25:38.709 --> 25:41.701
There are no large invisible
men, or women for that matter...

25:41.779 --> 25:46.011
in the sky taking a personal interest
in the fortunes of Gaius Baltar.

25:46.250 --> 25:47.615
Be careful.

25:48.152 --> 25:51.053
That which God gives,
he can also take away.

25:58.929 --> 26:00.294
15 seconds.

26:07.505 --> 26:09.097
Maybe this time.

26:20.985 --> 26:22.179
Dradis?

26:23.320 --> 26:24.981
No enemy contacts.

26:26.724 --> 26:28.624
Keep the clock running.

26:31.395 --> 26:33.056
What do you think?

26:36.333 --> 26:37.925
I think we wait.

27:12.736 --> 27:14.533
Get me the President.

27:21.745 --> 27:23.235
Why this time?

27:24.981 --> 27:26.881
Was it something that you did?

27:26.950 --> 27:30.078
We had a new plan, but we didn't
have time to implement it yet.

27:30.153 --> 27:33.145
<i>We lost that ship during the
last cycle, the Olympic Carrier.</i>

27:33.223 --> 27:35.851
Does that have something
to do with it?

27:36.559 --> 27:38.151
<i>Possibly.</i>

27:45.635 --> 27:47.125
Are you there?

27:47.670 --> 27:49.194
Yeah, I'm here.

27:51.508 --> 27:55.467
What do we do now, Commander? I've
got people on the verge over here.

27:56.513 --> 28:00.540
We're going to go to Condition Two. We
have to take advantage of this time...

28:00.617 --> 28:02.209
<i>and let our people
get some rest.</i>

28:02.285 --> 28:03.616
All right.

28:04.154 --> 28:07.214
And how long do we stay
at Condition Two?

28:08.324 --> 28:11.157
Until I'm satisfied
they're not going to return.

28:11.227 --> 28:13.218
<i>It's a military decision.</i>

28:14.297 --> 28:16.197
It is. I know that.

28:16.266 --> 28:19.963
You're right and I defer to
your decision. And, Commander...

28:21.771 --> 28:23.762
<i>let your men and women...</i>

28:25.241 --> 28:29.837
<i>know how grateful I am for the
job that they are doing, please.</i>

28:32.081 --> 28:33.742
Thank them for me.

28:35.084 --> 28:37.177
<i>Thank you, Madam President.</i>

28:37.320 --> 28:38.651
Thank you.

28:43.893 --> 28:45.417
Contact Apollo.

28:46.062 --> 28:49.327
Tell him to set up a combat
patrol around the fleet...

28:49.399 --> 28:52.459
and order his other pilots
to land immediately.

28:52.735 --> 28:54.794
All right, people,
you heard the order.

28:54.871 --> 28:59.137
Boomer, Starbuck, form up with
me. We'll fly the first CAP.

28:59.809 --> 29:03.370
<i>I want everyone else back on
Galactica and in their racks.</i>

29:03.646 --> 29:05.409
<i>Three-hour rotation.</i>

29:05.682 --> 29:06.944
<i>Hey, Apollo...</i>

29:07.016 --> 29:09.746
not that I'm not honored by being
chosen to sit in my cockpit...

29:09.819 --> 29:11.446
for the next three hours but...

29:11.521 --> 29:12.920
But why you?

29:14.123 --> 29:15.590
Take a guess.

29:15.892 --> 29:17.689
<i>Because I'm on drugs?</i>

29:18.261 --> 29:20.525
You got it. This patrol
is 100% stimulated.

29:20.597 --> 29:21.621
<i>[Starbuck laughing]</i>

29:21.698 --> 29:23.325
<i>Anyone else feels like...</i>

29:23.399 --> 29:26.562
they have frakking ants
crawling behind their eyeballs?

29:26.636 --> 29:28.331
<i>How about you, Boomer?</i>

29:29.005 --> 29:32.065
Doc tells me you're holding up
better than anybody in the squadron.

29:32.175 --> 29:33.904
I'm tired like everybody else.

29:33.977 --> 29:35.171
<i>You never seem it.</i>

29:35.245 --> 29:36.906
<i>That's 'cause she's a Cylon.</i>

29:36.980 --> 29:39.608
You're going to make me come
over there and kick your ass.

29:39.682 --> 29:42.674
Okay. Let's set up
a patrol here...

29:42.752 --> 29:44.777
before somebody gets hurt.

29:45.722 --> 29:46.814
Follow me.

29:46.890 --> 29:49.017
<i>Copy that, Apollo.</i>

29:55.765 --> 29:59.223
A couple hours rack time
does sound awfully sweet...

29:59.302 --> 30:00.360
right about now.

30:00.436 --> 30:01.994
You deserve it.

30:03.973 --> 30:06.134
You know, the truth is...

30:07.944 --> 30:12.005
all this has me feeling more
alive than I have in years.

30:14.050 --> 30:15.745
You look that way, too.

30:15.818 --> 30:18.343
It's good to see you
without the cup in your hand.

30:18.454 --> 30:19.648
Don't start.

30:19.722 --> 30:22.885
I know there's a whole lot
of people aboard this ship...

30:22.959 --> 30:25.689
that wish you weren't feeling
as good as you are.

30:25.762 --> 30:29.027
If the crew doesn't hate the
XO, then he's not doin' his job.

30:29.098 --> 30:32.090
Besides, got to make
the old man look good.

30:32.769 --> 30:34.498
I always look good.

30:34.971 --> 30:36.939
Did you look in a mirror?

30:37.006 --> 30:37.995
Seriously...

30:38.074 --> 30:39.132
Sir.

30:39.208 --> 30:42.507
...it's one thing to push the
crew, it's another to break them.

30:42.578 --> 30:43.806
Dradis contact.

30:43.880 --> 30:47.043
Bearing 348,
carom 120, one ship.

30:47.784 --> 30:49.274
Getting recognition signal.

30:49.352 --> 30:52.116
<i>Initiating response
flash mode. Alpha, alpha.</i>

30:52.188 --> 30:53.849
<i>It's the Olympic Carrier, sir.</i>

30:53.923 --> 30:55.288
Is that confirmed?

30:55.358 --> 30:57.121
It's confirmed, sir.

31:02.198 --> 31:03.722
Thank the gods.

31:08.938 --> 31:10.530
Action stations.

31:13.810 --> 31:16.142
Put the fleet
into Condition One.

31:16.245 --> 31:19.612
I want all Vipers manned and
ready, but keep them in the tubes.

31:19.682 --> 31:20.706
Mr. Gaeta.

31:20.783 --> 31:21.772
Sir?

31:21.851 --> 31:24.081
Restart the clock. 33 minutes.

31:26.856 --> 31:28.016
I hope you're wrong.

31:28.091 --> 31:29.080
So do I.

31:29.158 --> 31:30.250
<i>Clock is running.</i>

31:30.326 --> 31:31.554
So do I.

31:36.232 --> 31:39.030
No. It's all wrong.

31:40.603 --> 31:43.663
If they were left behind, why
didn't the Cylons destroy them?

31:43.940 --> 31:46.238
And why are they
showing up now?

31:46.376 --> 31:49.402
It's God's punishment
for your lack of faith.

31:50.246 --> 31:52.339
That's just great, that is.

31:53.049 --> 31:55.984
A more logical and useful
explanation, please.

31:56.886 --> 31:58.217
All right.

31:59.922 --> 32:03.824
<i>The Olympic Carrier has been
infiltrated by Cylon agents.</i>

32:07.063 --> 32:10.555
They've been
tracking the ship all along.

32:12.435 --> 32:13.459
No.

32:16.005 --> 32:17.734
Then that means...

32:18.007 --> 32:20.976
Logically, in order
for you to survive...

32:21.344 --> 32:24.040
the Olympic Carrier
should be destroyed.

32:28.284 --> 32:29.945
<i>Olympic Carrier,
Olympic Carrier...</i>

32:30.019 --> 32:34.012
<i>this is Raptor 478, call sign
Boomer. I have you in visual contact.</i>

32:34.089 --> 32:36.080
<i>Please respond
on this channel. Over.</i>

32:36.158 --> 32:37.284
<i>Raptor 478,</i>

32:37.359 --> 32:40.055
<i>this is the Olympic Carrier.
We have you in visual contact.</i>

32:40.129 --> 32:43.792
<i>Thank the Lords of Kobol. You don't
know how relieved we are to see you.</i>

32:43.866 --> 32:47.597
<i>Roger that, Olympic Carrier.
Can I ask about your whereabouts?</i>

32:47.670 --> 32:49.501
<i>We had trouble
with our FTL drive.</i>

32:49.572 --> 32:51.836
<i>Took us almost three hours
to fix.</i>

32:51.907 --> 32:55.070
Have Boomer ask them
how they escaped the Cylons.

32:55.878 --> 32:57.539
<i>Olympic Carrier, Boomer.</i>

32:57.613 --> 33:00.639
<i>I've been directed to ask how
you escaped from the Cylons.</i>

33:00.716 --> 33:02.411
<i>You got me. They were
closing in on us...</i>

33:02.484 --> 33:03.917
<i>when the rest of you
were jumping.</i>

33:03.986 --> 33:06.181
<i>I thought we were goners,
then they just broke off.</i>

33:06.255 --> 33:08.416
<i>Someone must've been
watching out for us.</i>

33:08.490 --> 33:09.479
<i>Roger that.</i>

33:09.558 --> 33:10.616
<i>One other thing, Boomer.</i>

33:10.693 --> 33:12.183
<i>I've got a Dr. Amarak
on board...</i>

33:12.261 --> 33:14.957
<i>who has an urgent matter
to discuss with the President.</i>

33:15.030 --> 33:16.190
<i>He's been driving me crazy.</i>

33:16.265 --> 33:18.460
<i>Olympic Carrier,
can you be more specific?</i>

33:18.534 --> 33:21.992
<i>I'm afraid I can't. He says he knows
something about a traitor in our midst...</i>

33:22.071 --> 33:25.131
<i>and he's unwilling to share
any more than that.</i>

33:25.307 --> 33:27.036
Madam President,
I strongly recommend...

33:27.109 --> 33:30.738
that we cut off all wireless
communication with that ship right away.

33:30.813 --> 33:32.144
Why?

33:32.214 --> 33:35.183
Look, forgive me for being
rude, but wake up, all right?

33:35.250 --> 33:37.548
<i>The only reason the Olympic
Carrier is still flying...</i>

33:37.620 --> 33:39.588
is because the Cylons
let them survive.

33:39.655 --> 33:41.486
They've been
tracking that ship all along.

33:41.557 --> 33:43.684
There's probably a Cylon
agent aboard right now!

33:43.759 --> 33:44.817
Calm down.

33:45.461 --> 33:46.826
Start over.

33:47.630 --> 33:51.122
Please, Madam President,
I implore you. Listen to me.

33:51.700 --> 33:53.759
Cut off radio communication
with that ship...

33:53.836 --> 33:56.964
before they send via broadcast
signal another computer virus...

33:57.039 --> 34:00.406
to infect our ship shortly
before they blow us all up.

34:01.944 --> 34:04.242
Com. Adama,
are you on the line?

34:05.247 --> 34:08.239
Cut off the speakers.
Put it through the line.

34:08.851 --> 34:12.753
Yes, Madam President. And I'm
inclined to agree with Dr. Baltar.

34:15.190 --> 34:16.680
Good. So do I.

34:17.493 --> 34:19.085
Thank the gods you're with us.

34:19.161 --> 34:21.561
God's got nothing
to do with this.

34:26.301 --> 34:27.962
<i>Boomer, Galactica.</i>

34:28.037 --> 34:31.768
<i>Your orders are to jam all
transmissions from the Olympic Carrier.</i>

34:31.840 --> 34:34.468
No further voice contact
is authorized.

34:35.144 --> 34:37.009
<i>Roger that, Galactica.</i>

34:37.346 --> 34:38.973
<i>Boomer, Galactica.</i>

34:39.048 --> 34:41.073
<i>Orders are
to send the Olympic Carrier...</i>

34:41.150 --> 34:43.141
<i>the following message
by signal light.</i>

34:43.352 --> 34:46.651
Message begins,
"Maintain present position.

34:46.722 --> 34:50.453
<i>"Do not, repeat, do not approach
the fleet until further notice. "</i>

34:50.526 --> 34:51.993
<i>Message ends.</i>

34:53.829 --> 34:56.992
I'm getting a bad feeling
about where this is headed.

34:57.066 --> 34:58.294
So am I.

34:58.734 --> 35:01.862
If the ship poses a threat to us,
we have to eliminate that threat.

35:09.712 --> 35:11.577
I don't think
they got the message, Apollo.

35:11.647 --> 35:16.209
Yeah, I see it. Boomer, break
wireless silence on my authority.

35:16.285 --> 35:19.118
Warn them to stop their
engines immediately.

35:19.722 --> 35:23.556
I suggest that we evacuate the
passengers and destroy the ship.

35:23.792 --> 35:26.226
It solves the problem
if they're tracking the ship.

35:26.295 --> 35:28.661
What if they're tracking
one of the passengers?

35:28.731 --> 35:30.631
<i>Olympic Carrier,
Olympic Carrier...</i>

35:30.699 --> 35:34.499
<i>you are ordered to stop your
engines immediately. Acknowledge.</i>

35:36.305 --> 35:38.330
<i>Apollo,
they're not responding.</i>

35:38.407 --> 35:40.238
<i>Are you using the same channel?</i>

35:40.309 --> 35:42.641
<i>Yeah, but suddenly
nobody's home.</i>

35:43.946 --> 35:46.642
Starbuck, fire a burst
across their bow.

35:48.650 --> 35:49.981
Copy that.

35:57.860 --> 36:01.557
<i>Boomer, let Galactica know
we have a problem out here.</i>

36:02.197 --> 36:04.722
Commander,
message from Boomer.

36:04.800 --> 36:07.166
<i>The Olympic Carrier is heading
directly for us, sir.</i>

36:07.236 --> 36:09.727
They're refusing all orders
to stop.

36:10.572 --> 36:11.834
[beeping]

36:23.485 --> 36:25.851
<i>Galactica, they're
still not responding...</i>

36:25.921 --> 36:28.822
<i>and continue to head toward
the fleet. Request instructions.</i>

36:28.891 --> 36:31.519
Order the fleet
to execute Jump 240.

36:31.593 --> 36:33.720
Get us between that ship
and the fleet.

36:33.796 --> 36:37.960
Commander! Dradis contact. Strike
that, multiple Dradis contacts.

36:40.035 --> 36:41.627
It's the Cylons.

36:47.376 --> 36:49.571
<i>The Cylons
are on an intercept course.</i>

36:49.645 --> 36:52.978
They'll be in weapons range
within two minutes.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.246
Radiological alarm!

36:57.653 --> 36:59.086
Radiological alarm!

36:59.154 --> 37:00.519
From where?

37:02.157 --> 37:04.955
<i>The Olympic Carrier, sir.
They've got nukes on board.</i>

37:05.027 --> 37:09.726
<i>Madam President, we have to eliminate
the Olympic Carrier immediately.</i>

37:10.232 --> 37:12.996
There are 1,300 people
on that ship.

37:13.402 --> 37:14.562
<i>We don't know that.</i>

37:14.636 --> 37:17.298
<i>The Cylons may have
captured them already.</i>

37:17.372 --> 37:20.500
She's not going to do it.
She has to do it.

37:21.410 --> 37:23.401
It's not her decision, Gaius.

37:23.478 --> 37:24.467
No?

37:25.080 --> 37:28.538
It's God's choice.
He wants you to repent.

37:28.617 --> 37:32.576
Look, at this point there's no
choice. It's either them or us.

37:32.754 --> 37:34.517
Repent of your sins.

37:34.823 --> 37:37.656
Accept his true love
and you will be saved.

37:42.931 --> 37:46.526
I repent. There, I repent.

37:50.439 --> 37:53.499
I repent.

37:56.678 --> 37:57.838
Do it.

37:59.948 --> 38:02.041
<i>We have new orders.</i>

38:02.284 --> 38:06.345
<i>We're directed to destroy
the Olympic Carrier...</i>

38:06.421 --> 38:08.389
<i>and return to Galactica.</i>

38:09.625 --> 38:11.422
It's a civilian ship.

38:12.995 --> 38:15.725
<i>Yeah, a civilian ship with nukes.</i>

38:24.339 --> 38:26.864
<i>I don't see anybody in there,
do you?</i>

38:32.948 --> 38:34.916
The Cylons will be here
any second.

38:34.983 --> 38:37.611
If we're going to do this,
let's just do it.

38:37.686 --> 38:39.711
Starbuck, form up with me.

38:39.788 --> 38:42.086
<i>We'll make one pass
from astern.</i>

38:43.792 --> 38:46.317
<i>Lee, what if you're wrong?</i>

38:52.467 --> 38:53.934
<i>Lee, come on.</i>

38:54.569 --> 38:55.729
<i>Lee...</i>

38:58.573 --> 39:00.438
Okay, fire on my mark.

39:01.343 --> 39:03.140
No frakking way, Lee.

39:03.812 --> 39:06.303
Lee? Come on!

39:15.057 --> 39:16.149
Mark.

40:07.409 --> 40:08.899
Are you alive?

40:12.714 --> 40:14.682
Agathon, Karl C.

40:14.750 --> 40:16.684
Lieutenant, junior grade,
Colonial Fleet.

40:16.752 --> 40:19.687
PK-789-9348.

40:19.755 --> 40:21.689
I know who you are, Helo.

40:21.757 --> 40:23.952
It's all right. I'm a friend.

40:44.212 --> 40:45.406
Sharon?

40:50.652 --> 40:52.620
What are you doing here?

40:53.021 --> 40:54.488
Can you walk?

40:56.491 --> 40:58.686
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think so.

41:00.195 --> 41:01.719
What are you doing here,
I thought...

41:01.797 --> 41:03.526
Let's move, mister.

41:29.925 --> 41:30.983
Sir.

41:31.993 --> 41:33.051
Son.

41:46.641 --> 41:49.872
I gave the order.
It was my responsibility.

41:53.448 --> 41:55.245
I pulled the trigger.

41:58.854 --> 42:00.253
That's mine.

42:10.232 --> 42:12.132
Madam President?

42:14.836 --> 42:16.428
Madam President?

42:20.142 --> 42:22.667
I'm sorry,
you were saying something?

42:27.182 --> 42:29.377
Twenty-four hours, no Cylons.

42:30.018 --> 42:32.543
At least you know
it was the right choice.

42:32.621 --> 42:34.248
The right choice.

42:40.495 --> 42:43.862
I'm sorry, Billy. I think I'd
like some time alone, please.

42:43.932 --> 42:45.263
Of course.

42:57.979 --> 42:59.344
What is it?

43:00.982 --> 43:02.950
Update on the headcount.

43:03.218 --> 43:04.879
Subtract how many?

43:05.520 --> 43:07.545
Actually, you can add one.

43:10.091 --> 43:13.185
<i>A baby was born this morning
on the Rising Star.</i>

43:14.629 --> 43:15.789
A boy.

43:16.831 --> 43:18.025
A baby.

43:18.867 --> 43:19.959
Yeah.

43:26.808 --> 43:28.139
Thank you.
