Decisions, Clark.

00:04.269 --> 00:05.973
They are on the top of my to do list.

00:06.002 --> 00:08.870
With Lois out of town,
you don't have any excuses.

00:08.895 --> 00:12.045
These college application deadlines
are coming up soon, Clark.

00:12.064 --> 00:14.499
I know how hard it was giving up
those football scholarships,

00:14.510 --> 00:17.855
but we have to start making
some decisions about your future.

00:20.162 --> 00:21.315
I'll get it.

00:25.706 --> 00:26.693
Clark Kent?

Yes.

00:35.641 --> 00:37.025
What is it?

00:39.093 --> 00:40.903
It's from Dr. Swann.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.976
Clark, Martha.

I don't understand.
I just talked to him last week.

01:14.984 --> 01:16.335
I'm sorry, Clark.

01:16.452 --> 01:18.037
I truly am.

01:18.084 --> 01:19.632
We both are.

01:21.088 --> 01:25.491
There was still so much I needed to
learn from him about Krypton and Jor-El.

01:25.538 --> 01:29.410
We can be thankful for everything
he did pass on to you.

- Hello?
<i>- Hey, it's Jason.</i>

05:11.259 --> 05:12.501
Jason who?

05:12.771 --> 05:14.086
Very funny.

05:14.333 --> 05:17.045
Well, it doesn't sound like Kansas.
Where are you?

05:17.996 --> 05:19.332
Uh, Metropolis.

05:19.379 --> 05:22.303
I have to stay here for a few days,
oversee some things for Lex.

05:22.338 --> 05:24.966
I didn't realize that your job
required any overseeing.

05:25.013 --> 05:28.347
Yeah. Listen, I can't really talk right now.
I just stepped out of a meeting, but I...

05:28.383 --> 05:31.541
wanted to call 'cause
I didn't get a chance to before I left.

05:32.755 --> 05:34.140
Is Lex with you?

05:34.187 --> 05:35.608
No, I'm solo.

05:35.643 --> 05:37.334
Well, you'd better stay that way.

05:37.369 --> 05:40.058
I know what happens to people
when they run off to Metropolis.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.386
What was that?

05:46.079 --> 05:47.594
Nothing. Um,

05:47.626 --> 05:50.656
listen, I've gotta go. I'll call you
tomorrow, okay? Good night.

05:54.379 --> 05:55.459
Good night.

06:14.369 --> 06:15.285
Hello.

06:15.473 --> 06:18.232
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you skipped out on me.

06:18.267 --> 06:19.160
Lex.

06:19.383 --> 06:23.046
Yeah, uh... I was going to call you. Something
came up. I had to leave work early.

06:23.081 --> 06:25.744
To what, catch the next flight to Shanghai?

06:26.425 --> 06:27.141
What?

06:27.646 --> 06:29.396
Why don't you turn around?

06:34.255 --> 06:36.791
You didn't really think I'd
hire you, bring you into my life,

06:36.817 --> 06:39.375
and not follow every
step you take, did you?

06:39.410 --> 06:40.010
Lex...

06:40.032 --> 06:42.263
I know my father
gave you a map, Jason,

06:42.298 --> 06:45.542
and I know you've figured out that
it leads to a temple just outside the city,

06:45.577 --> 06:49.657
but if you think you're gonna find that
stone without me... you're mistaken.

06:53.818 --> 06:54.828
Let's go.

07:05.302 --> 07:08.354
I thought we agreed that you would
not go back down into the caves.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.325
Dad, I couldn't just
ignore Swann's message.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.086
I know that you trust him, but...

07:12.109 --> 07:14.622
Clark he doesn't know Jor-El
the way we do.

07:14.657 --> 07:16.673
Dad, it's not like I've forgotten
who we're dealing with here.

07:16.702 --> 07:19.127
I'm just afraid of what's going to happen
if we continue to ignore him.

07:19.175 --> 07:22.259
Listen, I realize that he's your
birth father, all right, but he...

07:22.294 --> 07:24.623
he's never had your
best interests at heart.

07:24.654 --> 07:27.413
Maybe, but he's never lied to me, either.
And the trials that he's put me through...

07:27.437 --> 07:30.642
maybe they're not all random. Maybe he's
trying to prepare me to find these stones.

07:30.677 --> 07:33.681
Are you really sure you want
to open all this up again?

07:33.716 --> 07:37.074
The last few months, ever since
you walked away from Jor-El,

07:37.109 --> 07:39.563
it's like we got the old Clark back.

07:40.877 --> 07:45.303
Well, mom, as much as I like playing football
and trying to be normal, the truth is, I'm not.

07:45.785 --> 07:47.147
We all know that.

07:49.248 --> 07:52.183
Look, I've already let one of these
stones slip through my hands.

07:52.958 --> 07:57.079
Even if you were to find the stones...
son, we have no idea what's gonna happen

07:57.126 --> 07:59.322
- if you bring 'em all together.
- I know, dad.

08:01.471 --> 08:03.786
But if I don't find them,
someone else will.

08:15.206 --> 08:16.427
Miss Lang.

08:18.341 --> 08:20.173
Please, don't be shy.

08:20.454 --> 08:24.734
You are looking for your elusive
boyfriend, I assume.

08:25.251 --> 08:28.949
Uh, yeah, I was hoping that Lex
could get in touch with him for me.

08:28.996 --> 08:32.988
He sent him to go catch up on this project,
and I can't seem to reach him on his cell.

08:33.024 --> 08:37.405
Well, I would imagine the reception
would be rather shoddy in China.

08:37.570 --> 08:43.089
Lex is in Shanghai. If I had to guess, I would
say that your boyfriend is there with him.

08:45.003 --> 08:48.553
I'm sorry, I thought Jason would've
told you what's happening...

08:48.612 --> 08:52.886
considering you are the one
born right into the middle of all this.

08:53.309 --> 08:56.337
You should know, miss Lang,
how thoroughly Lex and

08:56.363 --> 08:59.365
Jason have been studying
Isabelle Theroux, your...

08:59.399 --> 09:01.706
your rebellious ancestor.

09:02.816 --> 09:05.199
Looks like they aren't the only ones.

09:09.297 --> 09:12.948
Isabelle's arch rival was... a duchess

09:13.265 --> 09:15.121
Gertrude who was...

09:15.285 --> 09:18.856
obsessed with finding
three mythical stones.

09:20.347 --> 09:24.938
She sent ships to the far ends
of the known earth, but all her agents

09:25.056 --> 09:26.805
could discover

09:27.134 --> 09:28.531
was this map...

09:28.578 --> 09:30.445
somewhere in China.

09:31.913 --> 09:34.661
Well, what does this treasure map
have to do with Isabelle?

09:34.696 --> 09:37.702
The map never made it
into the hands of the duchess.

09:37.737 --> 09:40.778
Isabelle stole the document and hid it.

09:41.542 --> 09:46.077
Gertrude had the exquisite
young sorceress executed.

09:47.745 --> 09:49.623
Isabelle's looking for them, too.

09:49.764 --> 09:52.040
And she's working through you...

09:52.721 --> 09:54.869
using you as a vessel.

09:55.139 --> 09:59.824
I gave a copy of the map
to Jason, as well.

10:00.320 --> 10:03.091
I'm not surprised
he didn't tell you about it.

10:05.991 --> 10:07.635
Your kinship with...

10:07.741 --> 10:10.979
Isabelle may not be a secret,
but are you aware

10:11.015 --> 10:15.159
that Jason is a direct
descendant of the duchess...

10:15.805 --> 10:17.073
Gertrude.

11:17.660 --> 11:19.034
Going somewhere?

11:24.426 --> 11:25.518
China.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.442
China? Are you serious?

11:28.489 --> 11:31.800
And freaked out and mad and just about
everything else you can possibly imagine.

11:31.866 --> 11:33.345
Lana, what's going on?

11:33.369 --> 11:36.093
Which part... the immaculate tattoo,

11:36.121 --> 11:39.161
the fact that I seem to be
harboring a 16th-century witch,

11:39.198 --> 11:43.634
or that Jason and Lex took off with a map
to uncover it all behind my back?

11:43.672 --> 11:44.670
Why would they do that?

11:44.694 --> 11:47.627
I don't know, but Jason said that we
were gonna figure this out together,

11:47.662 --> 11:51.643
But it turns out he has a rather
limited definition of "we."

11:51.948 --> 11:55.506
Well, maybe he has a good reason
why he's not being open with you.

11:57.655 --> 11:59.322
Don't you think you owe him
a chance to explain?

11:59.346 --> 12:02.446
Clark, you know that I don't give up
on someone that easily.

12:05.099 --> 12:08.258
But I'm not gonna just
let him lie to me...

12:08.282 --> 12:10.219
even if it is for a good reason.

12:10.243 --> 12:13.096
So you're gonna take off and fly halfway
around the world just like that?

12:13.119 --> 12:15.832
Lionel Luthor made all the arrangements,
and I'm taking the Luthorcorp jet.

12:15.867 --> 12:19.343
And I know, Clark,
that I can't trust him.

12:19.766 --> 12:23.734
But he gave me the name of this
professor that might be able to help.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.281
Well, then I'm going with you.

12:30.733 --> 12:33.669
I'm not gonna drag you into this.

12:34.009 --> 12:36.007
I'm not letting you go alone.

12:41.174 --> 12:42.219
Jason...

12:42.571 --> 12:44.673
you can't trust my father.

12:45.253 --> 12:47.872
He gave you that map for a reason, and
now you're leading him right to the stone.

12:47.907 --> 12:50.314
I'm not working for
your father or anyone else.

12:50.783 --> 12:52.404
Then why does the stone
even matter to you?

12:52.439 --> 12:54.292
'Cause until I find out,
Lana's not gonna be safe.

12:54.327 --> 12:55.266
Safe from what?

12:55.302 --> 12:56.452
From my mom,

12:56.828 --> 12:59.411
from Lionel, from you.
I don't know, Lex. You tell me.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.135
Look, unless you hired
your own Chinese security,

13:02.170 --> 13:04.236
I think we've hit a bit of a snag.

13:04.765 --> 13:05.633
Run!

13:29.836 --> 13:31.010
What is this?

14:02.600 --> 14:05.512
How did Lionel know
these symbols were about you?

14:06.040 --> 14:08.776
There are two answers to that question.

14:08.823 --> 14:11.532
And they're both three time zones way.

14:15.125 --> 14:18.213
Clark, um, I'm sorry.
I feel like...

14:18.343 --> 14:20.642
you're the only person
in my life right now

14:20.668 --> 14:22.507
who doesn't have an agenda.

14:26.204 --> 14:29.504
Lana, whatever their motives are,
I'm sure they still care about you.

14:29.551 --> 14:32.533
That still doesn't change
the fact that everybody

14:32.559 --> 14:35.062
seems to know more
about me than I do.

14:35.765 --> 14:37.955
It must be scary to think
that someone out there has

14:37.970 --> 14:40.076
a plan for you, but you
don't know what it is yet.

14:42.515 --> 14:46.461
Ever since that tattoo appeared,
I feel like I've been

14:46.566 --> 14:49.373
walking around with this huge secret.

14:49.420 --> 14:52.250
Like, everybody only knows
what's on the surface, but

14:52.297 --> 14:55.772
there's something inside of me
that's so much more powerful.

14:55.821 --> 14:58.380
And you're afraid if people
know about that part of you,

14:58.410 --> 15:00.095
they'll see you differently.

15:00.118 --> 15:01.637
How could they not?

15:08.568 --> 15:10.000
So, um,

15:10.681 --> 15:13.347
what did your parents say
about coming to China?

15:14.110 --> 15:15.037
Nothing.

15:21.185 --> 15:23.609
I didn't tell them.
I left them a message.

15:28.802 --> 15:29.964
It's funny...

15:32.125 --> 15:34.825
the two people I ended up trusting are...

15:36.058 --> 15:37.244
Lionel Luthor

15:37.511 --> 15:38.779
and you.

15:50.144 --> 15:51.694
Well, boss,

15:53.021 --> 15:55.064
got any idea what we're doing here?

15:56.297 --> 15:59.987
Well, since they took the map
and brought us to the temple,

16:00.034 --> 16:03.075
I'm guessing they're after
the same thing we are.

16:06.187 --> 16:08.805
You're pretty anxious to make me
your sidekick, aren't you?

16:09.192 --> 16:12.068
Don't you think it's time we dropped
the stalemate of who knows what,

16:12.115 --> 16:13.867
and do whatever we can
to get out of here?

16:13.912 --> 16:16.155
If you want us to start
spilling our guts,

16:16.542 --> 16:17.986
you go first.

16:20.339 --> 16:21.290
Okay.

16:24.648 --> 16:27.029
We both know my father
had every inch of

16:27.055 --> 16:29.957
this place scoured, and
he didn't find the stone.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.661
Come on, Jason.

16:33.483 --> 16:35.780
You wouldn't have lied to
Lana and come all the way

16:35.806 --> 16:38.121
here unless you knew the
secret to reading that map.

16:38.157 --> 16:40.012
No, I lied to Lana to protect her.

16:40.047 --> 16:41.336
Oh, right...

16:41.501 --> 16:44.812
I forgot. Lana's new
self-appointed hero.

16:44.870 --> 16:47.395
She seems to have a way
of attracting them.

16:49.097 --> 16:50.577
Yeah, it looks that way.

16:58.164 --> 16:59.796
I don't believe you're that naïve.

17:00.747 --> 17:04.181
You're either being used
by my father or your mother.

17:04.228 --> 17:06.512
Who's ever pulling the strings...
don't think for a second

17:06.520 --> 17:08.595
they wouldn't sacrifice Lana.

17:09.864 --> 17:13.854
In the end, I have a feeling I may be
the one protecting Lana from you.

17:26.193 --> 17:27.391
Okay, okay.

17:29.786 --> 17:31.054
You can't do this.

17:33.710 --> 17:34.943
Where are you taking me?

17:36.164 --> 17:37.714
Where are you taking me?

17:48.442 --> 17:51.025
It's hard to believe we were driving
by cornstalks this morning.

17:51.049 --> 17:54.077
We are definitely
not in Kansas anymore.

17:59.255 --> 18:01.345
So how are we supposed
to find this professor Sen?

18:05.968 --> 18:06.797
Um...

18:08.080 --> 18:10.663
Lionel said to just take this street, uh,

18:10.699 --> 18:12.906
until we find a green rooster.

18:15.051 --> 18:18.339
You know, Lana, I'm not sure
we should trust this woman.

18:18.661 --> 18:20.516
Maybe we can do this on our own.

18:20.587 --> 18:23.334
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
that you spoke fluent Mandarin

18:23.340 --> 18:25.870
and knew your way around Shanghai.

18:28.184 --> 18:30.533
Miss Lang, Mr. Kent.

18:30.580 --> 18:32.529
I'm glad you guys made it here safely.

18:32.587 --> 18:34.231
Do you have the map?

18:37.848 --> 18:40.020
Oh, I never really believed this existed.

18:40.055 --> 18:43.343
You have no idea how many fortune
hunter shave searched for this map.

18:44.718 --> 18:47.336
The temple seems to be
located at the fork of a river.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.368
That's odd. There's no river there.

18:49.403 --> 18:51.775
But these symbols... they match
those on the temple walls.

18:51.810 --> 18:53.301
So you know where it is.

18:53.358 --> 18:56.927
I know the place well.
There's no mistaking that symbol.

18:56.974 --> 18:59.921
Are you sure this is the only temple
with these kind of markings?

18:59.956 --> 19:01.659
On this continent, anyway.

19:01.706 --> 19:03.714
That's all part of the temple's mystique.

19:03.761 --> 19:06.884
There's a myth that claimed
an all-powerful god

19:06.931 --> 19:10.043
that came from another world
and hid a treasure there.

19:10.090 --> 19:12.426
The god left some kind of map to it,

19:12.627 --> 19:16.561
but the map was stolen centuries
ago by European bandits.

19:16.960 --> 19:20.389
As far as we know,
they never found the treasure.

19:21.457 --> 19:22.864
Can you take us to it?

19:22.911 --> 19:23.838
Of course.

19:24.226 --> 19:26.151
But don't show this to anyone.

19:26.339 --> 19:29.157
As long as the stone is still out there,

19:29.204 --> 19:32.387
there are fortune seekers
who are willing to kill for it.

19:37.683 --> 19:39.092
We need to be careful.

19:39.115 --> 19:41.041
Other people may know you are here.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.059
Lex.

19:57.844 --> 19:58.607
No! Lex...

19:58.642 --> 20:00.673
look, tell them whatever
they want to know!

20:00.720 --> 20:02.776
This isn't worth dying over!

20:12.250 --> 20:13.541
Just scare him.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.862
Find out what he knows,
but don't hurt him.

20:18.614 --> 20:20.669
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.

20:20.717 --> 20:23.030
I can't make such a promise.

20:26.541 --> 20:28.032
We had an agreement.

20:28.067 --> 20:30.824
There are people who have
more money than you.

20:36.906 --> 20:39.246
I never wanted anyone harmed!

20:50.734 --> 20:52.589
During the cultural revolution,

20:52.624 --> 20:55.524
the government destroyed
most of the ancient temples.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.556
But for some reason,
they protected this one.

20:58.767 --> 21:02.031
Maybe because it's always
been shrouded in superstition.

21:02.064 --> 21:05.023
Villagers have refused
to cross the threshold,

21:05.070 --> 21:08.487
fearful that the god will one
day return as he promised.

21:36.269 --> 21:37.784
Clark, did you find something?

21:39.240 --> 21:41.084
Just more symbols.

21:41.377 --> 21:44.629
Why don't you two keep searching
around? I'll look more in here.

21:45.835 --> 21:46.880
This way.

21:48.876 --> 21:51.647
This is an other chamber in the east wing.

22:45.020 --> 22:46.194
What was that?

22:52.165 --> 22:53.433
Run, Lana!

23:47.008 --> 23:48.025
Enough!

23:53.041 --> 23:54.262
Tell me...

23:54.297 --> 23:56.258
where this leads to.

24:06.268 --> 24:09.720
Do you really think your friend
will have such strong will?

24:24.487 --> 24:25.911
Where is the stone?!

24:26.349 --> 24:27.788
Where is the stone?!

24:28.304 --> 24:29.869
Where is the stone?!

24:37.132 --> 24:40.373
I hope your young friend
will have more sense than you.

24:45.805 --> 24:47.073
Lana.

24:48.879 --> 24:50.487
No... don't.

24:51.473 --> 24:53.399
- Don't!
- No, no, no!

24:59.536 --> 25:01.145
No, I don't know anything!

25:01.180 --> 25:03.035
She has nothing to do with this!

25:03.082 --> 25:04.914
Maybe not.

25:06.004 --> 25:06.850
Wait!

25:08.928 --> 25:09.985
No!

25:18.861 --> 25:19.824
Stop!

25:32.838 --> 25:35.768
<i>Mitare me us animame.</i>

25:38.617 --> 25:40.085
<i>Liberare!</i>

26:03.179 --> 26:07.253
Did you really think I would let any harm
come to this body I've possessed?

26:08.169 --> 26:09.790
You two again.

26:09.895 --> 26:11.034
Isabelle.

26:11.821 --> 26:14.850
You are a resilient lad, aren't you?

26:15.120 --> 26:18.000
So earnest, and yet
so tragically doomed

26:18.005 --> 26:19.760
to pay for the sins
of your ancestors.

26:19.763 --> 26:21.483
Lana, if there's any part
of you in there...

26:21.490 --> 26:24.008
and you, greedy boy...

26:25.000 --> 26:27.964
I can only imagine what
mischief you would cause

26:27.970 --> 26:30.570
were you to unite the
stones of knowledge.

26:34.111 --> 26:35.824
Too bad that neither
of you could see

26:35.835 --> 26:37.837
what was right in front
of you all along.

26:40.708 --> 26:42.634
It was never a map.

27:12.901 --> 27:13.735
Clark!

27:21.872 --> 27:24.192
You put up a better fight last time.

28:00.037 --> 28:01.493
Clark, what are you doing here?

28:03.219 --> 28:04.793
I could ask you the same thing.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.892
How could you put Lana
in the middle of this?

28:06.928 --> 28:08.883
I swear, Clark, if anything happens to her

28:08.918 --> 28:10.328
she's here because you lied to her!

28:10.340 --> 28:12.580
I get the feeling that Lana
can handle herself right now!

28:12.600 --> 28:14.001
If Isabelle gets her
hand on that stone,

28:14.027 --> 28:15.666
there's no telling what's
gonna happen to Lana.

28:15.700 --> 28:18.400
Clark, if there's anything
you know that we don't...

28:19.985 --> 28:21.417
I think I found something.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.734
Clark, how did you just
stumble on this when my

28:34.760 --> 28:37.396
father had this place
searched from top to bottom?

28:37.817 --> 28:39.532
What do you want me to say, Lex?

28:41.798 --> 28:43.899
It's obviously been here a long time.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.322
Don't you want to look at this?

28:59.462 --> 29:00.566
Hang on...

29:01.353 --> 29:02.644
let me see the map.

29:03.772 --> 29:05.005
Let me see it.

29:17.517 --> 29:18.117
Well?

29:18.158 --> 29:20.599
Guys, this isn't a map to the temple.

29:21.693 --> 29:24.323
It's a drawing of the temple through the tree.

29:31.622 --> 29:33.806
That's why no one could find the stone here.

29:34.029 --> 29:36.026
But from this perspective...
the background

29:36.052 --> 29:38.205
goes on for miles. It
could be anywhere.

29:40.334 --> 29:42.096
What if it's not in the background?

29:42.128 --> 29:45.158
Think about it. The artist would've
been standing right where you are.

29:45.627 --> 29:48.762
What if it's located there
at the base of the tree?

30:15.695 --> 30:18.374
<i>Spectaculum lapis.</i>

31:46.425 --> 31:49.953
Nobody has sacrificed as
much as I have for these stones.

31:49.997 --> 31:51.222
They don't belong to you.

31:51.266 --> 31:53.568
And you think they were meant for you?

31:54.100 --> 31:55.957
They were left for nobody.

31:56.370 --> 31:59.691
The god of this temple
hid them for his return.

32:08.466 --> 32:11.727
Penetrare eims corpus.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.575
How'd we get away from the guards?

33:32.113 --> 33:33.456
It was Isabelle.

33:36.019 --> 33:37.657
What'd I do?

33:48.342 --> 33:49.966
Did you find the stone?

33:57.949 --> 33:59.144
It's gone.

34:28.788 --> 34:31.092
Kinda hard to take a
college application essay

34:31.118 --> 34:33.699
seriously after the last
couple of days, isn't it?

34:33.844 --> 34:37.328
I was just trying to figure out if hidden
temples and body-snatching witches

34:37.371 --> 34:40.514
fits under "community service"
or "extracurriculars."

34:42.197 --> 34:45.879
Did I come at a bad time? You seemed
kind of startled when you saw me.

34:46.159 --> 34:48.462
No, I just, um...

34:49.982 --> 34:51.909
I thought maybe you
were my parents.

34:51.935 --> 34:54.434
I've been avoiding them
ever since we got back.

34:55.545 --> 34:57.863
And the real reason would be?

34:58.624 --> 35:01.532
Seeing you speak Latin and throw
those guys around the room like

35:01.576 --> 35:03.524
toothpicks is kind of weird.

35:05.812 --> 35:08.084
And even when Isabelle's gone,

35:08.321 --> 35:10.542
sometimes I look at
you, and there's a part

35:10.568 --> 35:12.535
of you that I don't
recognize anymore.

35:16.214 --> 35:17.203
What?

35:17.247 --> 35:20.302
I'm sorry. It's just that...

35:21.776 --> 35:25.171
do you know how funny
that sounds coming from you?

35:31.089 --> 35:35.369
Somehow, I think that the only way
that I'm going to put Isabelle and

35:35.402 --> 35:40.228
all of this other stuff behind me
is if I find all three of those stones.

35:42.367 --> 35:44.389
I'm sure they'll end up in the right hands.

35:44.758 --> 35:46.264
I hope so...

35:46.810 --> 35:51.984
because right now I kinda feel like some random
piece of a puzzle I'll never understand.

35:52.043 --> 35:54.759
Well, maybe we're not supposed
to understand it just yet.

35:59.865 --> 36:03.568
I get the feeling that our lives
are a lot less random than we think.

36:07.818 --> 36:08.910
Maybe.

36:13.235 --> 36:14.622
Good night, Clark.

37:00.691 --> 37:02.359
How was China?

37:02.403 --> 37:04.248
Full of surprises.

37:05.234 --> 37:06.385
Lex, what happened?

37:06.429 --> 37:09.824
Even though getting pistol-whipped
wasn't exactly my idea of fun,

37:09.868 --> 37:12.687
I have to admit, it's good
to have the old dad back.

37:12.728 --> 37:16.908
No, I had nothing to do with
what happened to you in China, son.

37:16.964 --> 37:19.532
I have abandoned my search for the stones.

37:19.591 --> 37:20.946
Come on, dad,

37:20.990 --> 37:25.359
you stole copies of my map and gave
them to Lana and jason. You used them.

37:25.418 --> 37:28.030
No, Lex. It was you who was using them.

37:28.060 --> 37:31.292
And you'll do far worse to find those stones.

37:33.215 --> 37:38.469
You have a ferocious desire to find
all the answers, son, but don't...

37:38.513 --> 37:43.841
let your search for those stones
turn into your personal tower of babel.

37:44.963 --> 37:47.972
I'm not trying to get closer to god, dad.

37:48.193 --> 37:51.322
I'm trying to solve the
riddles he's laid out for me.

37:52.104 --> 37:54.923
Did you ever think there might be a reason
why we weren't given the answers?

37:54.967 --> 37:56.222
To challenge us?

37:56.266 --> 37:58.185
Or maybe to humble us.

37:58.229 --> 38:00.883
Knowledge comes from finding the answers,

38:00.927 --> 38:04.868
yes, but understanding
what the answers mean...

38:05.428 --> 38:07.332
is what brings wisdom.

38:07.701 --> 38:11.007
Men who didn't understand the
difference have been the ruin of...

38:11.051 --> 38:13.868
some of the world's greatest civilizations.

38:16.421 --> 38:19.119
Is that why you stopped
looking for the stones?

38:20.064 --> 38:21.835
Because you're afraid?

38:24.122 --> 38:28.594
No. No, I stopped because I realized
that even if I find the three stones,

38:28.860 --> 38:31.570
I'm not gonna find
what I'm really looking for.

38:33.858 --> 38:35.673
Neither will you.

38:44.559 --> 38:46.124
Can I at least come in?

38:54.123 --> 38:58.313
I guess I don't have to ask why I haven't heard
from you since we got back from Shanghai.

39:03.729 --> 39:05.500
I'm sorry I lied to you.

39:05.766 --> 39:08.511
I don't even know which lie
you're apologizing for.

39:08.552 --> 39:11.356
That you said you were in Metropolis
when you really were in China,

39:11.400 --> 39:14.013
or that you've been working
with your mom all along?

39:14.751 --> 39:18.676
I wasn't honest about going to China because
I didn't want to put you into danger.

39:19.119 --> 39:23.310
If you remember a certain torture chair,
I'd say that's pretty decent foresight.

39:26.099 --> 39:27.870
You have to believe me.

39:29.228 --> 39:31.058
Give me one good reason.

39:32.180 --> 39:33.242
Okay.

39:41.202 --> 39:42.486
Is that good enough?

39:46.102 --> 39:47.873
Jason, how did you...

39:48.114 --> 39:52.143
I got there right before Lex.
I saw you and Clark knocked out.

39:52.306 --> 39:54.372
And there it was... right in front of me.

39:55.553 --> 39:57.958
I didn't want Lex or
Clark to know about it,

39:57.984 --> 39:59.961
so I mailed it to
myself from China.

40:01.235 --> 40:02.755
Did you tell your mom?

40:03.222 --> 40:04.786
I got it for you.

40:05.981 --> 40:08.081
All I care about is
protecting you, okay?

40:08.107 --> 40:10.655
You're the only one in my
life that matters to me.

40:16.846 --> 40:18.897
Blink twice if you can understand me.

40:45.075 --> 40:46.182
Well,

40:46.226 --> 40:48.528
I do hope you brought us a souvenir.

40:48.558 --> 40:50.480
I know that going
to China is grounds

40:50.506 --> 40:53.059
for a serious lecture, but
I didn't have a choice.

40:53.103 --> 40:54.446
All right, Clark.

40:55.170 --> 40:59.045
At least please tell us that the stone
is safe in the cave with the other one.

41:00.698 --> 41:02.808
Look, even though there
was Kryptonite guarding

41:02.815 --> 41:05.197
the original map, I got
the stone in my hand.

41:07.354 --> 41:08.623
But I lost it.

41:08.741 --> 41:10.480
Clark, I don't understand.

41:10.524 --> 41:12.669
If these stones were
intended for you to find,

41:12.683 --> 41:14.509
why would they be
surrounded by Kryptonite?

41:14.553 --> 41:17.077
That makes me wonder if
they really were meant for me.

41:17.918 --> 41:20.132
But right now we have another problem.

41:20.545 --> 41:23.247
Before he died,
Dr. Swann sent me one last e-mail.

41:23.292 --> 41:25.372
He said he'd been searching
for the stones for years,

41:25.378 --> 41:27.725
and even with the vast resources at his disposal,

41:27.808 --> 41:30.848
it was futile. I was his last hope.

41:31.527 --> 41:35.697
And that's why he asked Bridgette Crosby
to give me the one stone he did find.

41:36.530 --> 41:37.888
Which stone?

41:37.947 --> 41:39.245
That's the thing.

41:39.393 --> 41:41.681
I called her numbers.
They were all disconnected.

41:41.740 --> 41:43.702
No one even claims to have known her.

41:43.747 --> 41:45.710
It's like she never existed.

42:06.626 --> 42:08.028
<i>Kal-El.</i>

42:08.545 --> 42:11.393
<i>You must write your own destiny...</i>
