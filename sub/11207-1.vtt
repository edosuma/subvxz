00:13.380 --> 00:14.847
- You guys...
how long were you dating?

00:14.881 --> 00:16.576
- About a year.

00:16.616 --> 00:17.810
- And you met in college, right?

00:17.851 --> 00:18.840
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:18.885 --> 00:20.682
It was about
seven years ago.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.813
But I'm more... I'm friends
with Jack, you know.

00:26.493 --> 00:29.428
- He used to take a frying pan
and just put cheese in it.

00:29.462 --> 00:31.089
And he'd roll it up.

00:31.131 --> 00:33.156
- Is this true?
- It's absolutely true.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.167
You've said that before.
- It's absolutely true.

00:35.201 --> 00:38.762
- He'd call it... he's like,
"Oh, I made my cheese log."

00:38.805 --> 00:40.204
- I needed a wheelchair.

00:40.240 --> 00:44.973
So one night, we went
to an emergency room entrance,

00:45.011 --> 00:47.605
and we stole a wheelchair
and took it out back.

00:47.647 --> 00:49.137
And he was pushing me
down the hill.

00:49.182 --> 00:50.410
- Tom did that?

00:50.450 --> 00:54.546
- Yeah, it was... he knew
that I needed a wheelchair.

00:54.587 --> 00:58.045
- He used to have one of those,
uh, those Sunfishes,

00:58.091 --> 01:00.321
you know, the boats
that have the one...

01:00.360 --> 01:01.520
- The one sail?
- The one sail.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.153
Yeah, yeah, free version.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.788
He would go out,
and he would be gone

01:04.831 --> 01:06.128
for, like, six or seven hours.

01:06.166 --> 01:07.565
And we'd be, like,
really worried,

01:07.600 --> 01:09.932
because we couldn't see him
from the shore.

01:09.969 --> 01:11.197
- What was that band called?

01:11.237 --> 01:13.467
- It was a band called Bigfoot.

01:13.506 --> 01:14.871
- No, it was...

01:16.509 --> 01:17.976
- 'Cause he was
a marine biologist.

01:18.011 --> 01:19.171
He liked big fish.

01:19.212 --> 01:21.009
- Well, yes, but the thing is,
there was a name

01:21.047 --> 01:22.537
attached to the wheelchair.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.345
So it was for someone.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.011
- Yeah, we've been friends
for a long time.

01:26.052 --> 01:29.112
- Yeah.

01:29.155 --> 01:33.114
- Mark was one of these guys who
would, like, walk into a room.

01:33.159 --> 01:35.093
You know, like we could be
at a party.

01:35.128 --> 01:36.755
You could have the one person
in the room,

01:36.796 --> 01:37.956
playing you, for example.

01:37.997 --> 01:39.589
Like, no one was talking.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.228
- No, but there's something
to be said for just somebody

01:43.269 --> 01:44.827
who just makes people
feel comfortable.

01:44.871 --> 01:45.860
- He did.
He did.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.603
- We were just walking down
the street.

01:59.252 --> 02:00.241
- Yeah, yeah.
Thank you.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.447
- You got it.

02:02.489 --> 02:06.949
- Trying make this, like,
a respectable event.

02:06.993 --> 02:10.758
Uh, I...

02:10.797 --> 02:15.860
uh, it's been a year.

02:15.902 --> 02:17.233
And, uh,

02:17.270 --> 02:19.033
I thought it was
really important

02:19.072 --> 02:22.769
that we do this for Tom.

02:22.809 --> 02:26.836
It's so hard to eulogize someone
who you look up to, you know,

02:26.880 --> 02:30.179
'cause Tom was amazing.

02:30.216 --> 02:31.547
He was the best fucking guy.

02:31.584 --> 02:33.176
I mean, he was a better friend
to all of us

02:33.219 --> 02:34.379
than we were to him.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.547
I mean, at least,
that's how I feel.

02:36.589 --> 02:37.886
I just think back.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.255
We were roommates at UW.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.317
And, like, I remember, like,

02:41.361 --> 02:44.592
at one point,
Sara came to visit me.

02:44.631 --> 02:48.863
And he moved all of his stuff
into the common room

02:48.902 --> 02:50.062
to sleep there.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.263
No, and he really...

02:51.304 --> 02:52.635
and I was like,
"It smells bad."

02:52.672 --> 02:54.537
And he was like, "No"...
He was like, "No, no, no.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.804
I'm gonna do it
so you can have sex."

02:56.843 --> 02:59.539
And I was like,
"We're not having sex."

02:59.579 --> 03:01.410
I would... and he was like,

03:01.447 --> 03:02.744
"But I'm optimistic, you know."

03:02.782 --> 03:04.807
And so I...

03:04.851 --> 03:06.944
and he was just so generous,
you know.

03:06.986 --> 03:08.681
He was just...
he was the best.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.189
And I was just thinking today,
I mean,

03:11.224 --> 03:14.125
I saw <i>Hotel Rwanda</i> came on TV.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.290
And he... he and I saw it
together in the theater.

03:18.331 --> 03:21.323
And the day after it came out,

03:21.367 --> 03:25.565
he started donating time at
the shelter in downtown Seattle.

03:25.605 --> 03:26.936
That's what he was like.

03:26.973 --> 03:28.406
You'd sit there
thinking about it,

03:28.441 --> 03:29.533
and he would do it.

03:29.576 --> 03:30.702
And just cheers... you know,

03:30.743 --> 03:32.176
I just want to say "cheers"
to that.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.372
Cheers.

03:33.413 --> 03:34.675
- To Tom.
- To Tom.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.375
- Cheers.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.145
- Tom and I were big
into movies,

03:38.184 --> 03:42.245
you know, growing up.

03:42.288 --> 03:43.414
Actually, Tom and I, like,

03:43.456 --> 03:47.654
had a seminal
movie experience together

03:47.694 --> 03:50.254
not dissimilar
from <i>Hotel Rwanda,</i>

03:50.296 --> 03:52.355
except it was with
<i>Revenge of the Nerds.</i>

03:54.767 --> 03:56.064
And it was fascinating.

03:56.102 --> 03:58.536
It sort of...

03:58.571 --> 04:00.004
it changed him,

04:00.039 --> 04:05.375
um, 'cause Tom
was not like you know him

04:05.411 --> 04:07.641
when he was younger.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.945
Tom was...

04:10.984 --> 04:12.815
he was the bully,

04:12.852 --> 04:15.912
I found out, like, when I went
to pick him up from school.

04:15.955 --> 04:18.788
And, um, he was
quite emotionally

04:18.825 --> 04:20.224
and physically manipulative.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.820
And when I watched him watching
<i>Revenge of the Nerds,</i>

04:22.862 --> 04:24.489
just something clicked in him,

04:24.530 --> 04:26.157
which was, he was learning
that, like,

04:26.199 --> 04:29.828
the bullies and the assholes
end up last,

04:29.869 --> 04:31.996
and the nerds
and the nice guys win.

04:32.038 --> 04:34.598
And his little brain
started clocking away

04:34.641 --> 04:36.006
and going "Oh, fuck."

04:36.042 --> 04:37.566
"If I'm gonna gain favor
in this world,"

04:37.610 --> 04:38.736
"I'm gonna be nice."

04:38.778 --> 04:40.473
"I'm gonna be altruistic."

04:40.513 --> 04:43.004
"I'm gonna watch <i>Hotel Rwanda</i>
and volunteer at a shelter,"

04:43.049 --> 04:44.573
"'cause girls will like that."

04:44.617 --> 04:45.777
"I will get laid."

04:45.818 --> 04:46.910
"I'll get better job."

04:46.953 --> 04:48.352
"I'll succeed forward
in the life"...

04:48.388 --> 04:49.650
- I don't think
that's what it is.

04:49.689 --> 04:50.815
- But the purist vers...

04:50.857 --> 04:52.290
- I don't think that
that's accurate.

04:52.325 --> 04:53.383
- Al?
Hey, Al?

04:53.426 --> 04:54.893
I know you spent
some time with him

04:54.927 --> 04:57.054
in the last couple of years,
but I... but he's my brother.

04:57.096 --> 04:59.121
- I just think you're gonna hold
someone to something

04:59.165 --> 05:01.065
that happened when they were
fucking 14 years old

05:01.100 --> 05:02.590
or whatever he was
when that happened.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.603
- If we're gonna toast the man,
let's toast the man.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.764
Let's not eulogize somebody like
a fucking bullshit...

05:06.806 --> 05:08.899
- Just the way you're saying
it is just like he's a dick.

05:08.941 --> 05:10.738
And it's like, he wasn't a dick.
He was amazing.

05:10.777 --> 05:12.142
- You're calling my brother
a dick?

05:12.178 --> 05:13.475
I'm not calling my brother
a dick.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.037
- Jack!

05:15.081 --> 05:16.412
- I'm just saying,

05:16.449 --> 05:19.885
let's not do what everybody does
at a funeral

05:19.919 --> 05:21.819
or a commemoratory ceremony

05:21.854 --> 05:23.788
where we just say,
"Uh, they were amazing,

05:23.823 --> 05:24.790
and they were generous,"

05:24.824 --> 05:26.155
'cause that's fucking bullshit.

05:26.192 --> 05:27.489
And it's a dishonor to the man.

05:27.527 --> 05:29.085
- So cheers.

05:29.128 --> 05:31.028
- No, I think
I'm gonna finish, Al,

05:31.064 --> 05:32.292
'cause I'm his brother.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.163
If we're gonna raise our glass,

05:34.200 --> 05:35.690
I want to raise our glass
to the man.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.863
You know half of the man,
and I know the whole man, okay?

05:38.905 --> 05:40.805
Who was fucking beautiful.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.934
He knew how to make himself work
and weave in the world.

05:43.976 --> 05:45.307
And I think
that's fucking great.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.937
And I would never call him
a dick for that,

05:46.979 --> 05:48.571
so fuck you
for saying that.

05:48.614 --> 05:50.343
But let's raise a glass
to the whole man.

05:50.383 --> 05:51.509
Cheers.

05:51.551 --> 05:52.950
Thank you.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.390
Cheers.

06:06.632 --> 06:10.568
So, anyway, I was...

06:10.603 --> 06:12.036
we should say something.

06:12.071 --> 06:14.562
But does anyone
want another drink?

06:14.607 --> 06:15.801
Or, uh...

06:22.014 --> 06:23.481
Oh, boy.

06:28.521 --> 06:30.182
- How'd that go for you?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.747
When you wrote it,

06:31.791 --> 06:36.057
how did you see that
actually playing out for you?

06:37.830 --> 06:41.459
I will say this.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.196
Some parties are forgettable.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.204
- You know what I mean?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.706
But I got to say,
this party...

06:47.740 --> 06:50.538
- Had great guacamole
and amazing public speaking.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.203
- Great public speaking.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.906
They'll remember it.

06:53.946 --> 06:58.645
- You got to stop.

06:58.684 --> 07:00.618
You know that, right?

07:02.221 --> 07:04.382
- Oh, this is...
this is that moment...

07:04.424 --> 07:06.221
- This is your intervention.
- Isn't it?

07:06.259 --> 07:09.160
This is...
this is hard Iris.

07:09.195 --> 07:11.220
- I miss you.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.461
I miss my friend.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.990
I know you're sad.

07:16.035 --> 07:19.630
I'm sad too.

07:19.672 --> 07:21.196
- Yeah.

07:23.910 --> 07:28.074
You know what I always
think about?

07:28.114 --> 07:31.277
I think about, like, you're...

07:31.317 --> 07:37.415
that must have been so hard
for you to leave Tom.

07:37.457 --> 07:41.052
That fucking guy loved you.

07:41.093 --> 07:42.287
Man.

07:42.328 --> 07:44.125
You are so...
but you were right,

07:44.163 --> 07:46.427
and you were so brave,
and you were so right.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.694
- It wasn't right with us.

07:47.733 --> 07:50.634
- No, it wasn't right
with you guys.

07:50.670 --> 07:54.231
But that's okay.

07:54.273 --> 07:56.070
Can I tell you something?

07:56.108 --> 07:58.975
I turned down the Trinity job.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.445
- Why?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.312
- I don't want to go to Trinity

08:03.349 --> 08:04.976
and show them who I am
right now,

08:05.017 --> 08:07.076
because they'll never
hire me again.

08:07.119 --> 08:09.986
And so that almost means,
like,

08:10.022 --> 08:11.353
I don't want to go another party

08:11.390 --> 08:12.948
and show them
who I am right now.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.550
And I don't want to go to a girl

08:14.594 --> 08:15.891
and show her who I am
right now...

08:15.928 --> 08:18.021
- You're a mess.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.828
- Well...

08:20.867 --> 08:23.461
- I've been watching you
for a year now,

08:23.503 --> 08:25.596
and whatever you're doing,

08:25.638 --> 08:27.902
and whatever you think
is helping you,

08:27.940 --> 08:30.170
I have a responsibility
as your friend

08:30.209 --> 08:31.904
to tell you
that it's not.

08:31.944 --> 08:33.308
- I knew this was coming,
by the way.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.313
- Okay.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.813
- Just tell me what to do.
- Okay.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.839
- That's basically where I'm at.
Just tell me what...

08:37.884 --> 08:39.044
- Okay, all right.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.609
- You know better than I do.
You know I...

08:40.653 --> 08:42.086
I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.315
- I know.
I have a plan.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.482
- You have a plan?

08:44.524 --> 08:45.821
- I just want you
to hear me out.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.655
It's just a plan right now.
- I love your plans.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.684
- You might not love this one,
but just hear me out.

08:49.729 --> 08:50.957
- But I don't have any plans.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.158
- Um, that's the good news.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.259
You know, uh, you know that
nice red bicycle that you have?

08:56.302 --> 08:57.269
Yes.

08:57.303 --> 08:58.998
- Yikes.
- Sorry.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.472
What you're going to do...

09:01.507 --> 09:03.372
you're gonna dust off
Old Red,

09:03.409 --> 09:05.001
you're gonna wheel him
out of the shed,

09:05.044 --> 09:06.978
and you're gonna get on a ferry.

09:07.013 --> 09:08.571
I'm sending you
to my dad's place.

09:08.614 --> 09:11.412
You know my dad's place
on the island?

09:11.450 --> 09:12.917
It's beautiful in the winter.

09:12.952 --> 09:16.581
It's idyllic and crisp
and peaceful and...

09:16.622 --> 09:18.886
- Like, by "beautiful" you mean,
"rainy and cold."

09:18.925 --> 09:20.586
- I'm sorry;
I got so distracted,

09:20.626 --> 09:22.457
'cause all I heard was
pissing and moaning.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.860
- Right.
Sorry, I started pissing.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.693
I'm not pissing.
I'm not pissing and moaning.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.894
I'm done.
I'm done.

09:28.935 --> 09:33.804
- You just need
some head space, okay?

09:33.839 --> 09:35.830
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.773
So then you're gonna take
a right on a road

09:43.816 --> 09:45.078
called Dunhill Road.

09:45.117 --> 09:47.108
And the house is right
at the end of the street.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.586
And it's the only house
on the lane.

09:48.621 --> 09:49.918
<i>- Okay.</i>

09:49.956 --> 09:53.448
<i>Um, I mean, seriously,
I'm just going not...</i>

09:53.492 --> 09:55.221
<i>like, what am I doing out here?</i>

09:55.261 --> 09:57.525
- You just sit there,
and you look out at the water,

09:57.563 --> 09:59.258
and you think
about your life.

09:59.298 --> 10:00.697
<i>- Really?
I'm just gonna sit?</i>

10:00.733 --> 10:01.859
- You're just gonna sit.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.300
There's no TV.
There's no internet.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.667
There's nothing.
It's just you.

10:04.704 --> 10:06.137
<i>- Do they have forks,
'cause I might...</i>

10:06.172 --> 10:07.161
- They have a couple...

10:07.206 --> 10:08.503
we have a couple of forks,
yeah.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.133
<i>- I might need to stab myself
in the face.</i>

10:11.310 --> 10:13.335
<i>- Will you please come visit me,
please?</i>

10:13.379 --> 10:16.280
- No, Jack.
I can't.

10:16.315 --> 10:19.045
This is... I can't anyway,
'cause I'm slammed.

10:19.085 --> 10:23.044
But I can't because this is...
this is for you, you know.

10:23.089 --> 10:26.115
Don't make me feel bad
about sending you off.

10:26.158 --> 10:28.217
<i>- All right, I'm gonna go have
the greatest time ever</i>

10:28.260 --> 10:29.522
<i>doing nothing.</i>

10:29.562 --> 10:32.087
<i>And if I don't come back
within a week,</i>

10:32.131 --> 10:34.065
<i>bring a razor
and deodorant.</i>

13:12.057 --> 13:14.048
Clang!

13:19.932 --> 13:23.595
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.830
Oh, shit.

13:24.870 --> 13:27.270
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.705
Hi, hi, I'm...

13:28.741 --> 13:30.402
- Ahh!
- Okay.

13:30.442 --> 13:33.434
I think I have the wrong house.
And I... I...

13:33.479 --> 13:36.778
Hey, Hannah!
You're Hannah!

13:36.816 --> 13:38.113
Oh, my God, I'm so...
I'm so sorry.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.516
I'm Jack.
I'm Iris' friend Jack.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.214
- You're Jack?

13:42.254 --> 13:43.846
- Yes, I'm so sorry
I freaked you out.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.754
- Holy fuck!
- Sorry.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.258
- Are you kidding me?

13:47.293 --> 13:49.887
What are you doing, like,
creeping around my house?

13:49.929 --> 13:51.692
- I was looking for the key.
And I'm so sorry.

13:51.730 --> 13:53.891
I didn't... I didn't even see
anything, so it's fine.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.662
- Fuck me.

13:55.701 --> 13:57.066
- Sorry, that's my fault.

13:57.102 --> 13:58.626
That's...

14:13.452 --> 14:14.783
Anyway, not to beat
a dead horse,

14:14.820 --> 14:15.946
but just to be super clear,

14:15.988 --> 14:17.421
I was looking
for the key out front,

14:17.456 --> 14:19.617
and I thought maybe
it was on the side.

14:19.658 --> 14:21.353
You know, and that's really...

14:21.393 --> 14:24.726
- Ring the bell.
Just ring the bell, dude.

14:24.763 --> 14:26.754
- Yeah, but I didn't know
anybody was here,

14:26.799 --> 14:28.198
so why would I ring
the bell?

14:28.234 --> 14:30.202
- You know what?
Just... let's drop it, okay?

14:30.236 --> 14:32.704
It's just...
it's done.

14:32.738 --> 14:35.366
- Anyway, sorry.

14:35.407 --> 14:39.935
But look, you obviously
came here to, what,

14:39.979 --> 14:41.241
get some alone time,

14:41.280 --> 14:43.248
and I'm clearly barging in.

14:43.282 --> 14:45.375
So I don't know, I'll just get
a cheap hotel, I think,

14:45.417 --> 14:46.782
and it'll be fine.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.787
- No, it's fine.
You can... you could stay.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.288
Yeah, it's fine.

14:50.322 --> 14:52.222
Stay.

14:52.258 --> 14:53.589
- I don't want to intrude.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.287
I really don't.

14:55.327 --> 14:56.555
- Look, Iris invited you up.

14:56.595 --> 14:57.960
You're a guest.

14:57.997 --> 15:00.659
You're welcome to stay.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.326
- You sure?

15:02.368 --> 15:04.131
- Yeah, I'm sure.

15:04.169 --> 15:05.466
There's plenty of room.

15:05.504 --> 15:08.940
I'm sure we won't even
run into each other.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.305
Are you hungry?

15:10.342 --> 15:13.209
There's bananas.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.475
- Those are bananas?

15:15.514 --> 15:17.948
- Well, they're dehydrated.

15:17.983 --> 15:20.008
- Oh, okay.

15:20.052 --> 15:22.452
I'm good.
Thank you.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.956
But yeah, if you're okay,
I'm... I will crash.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.753
- Okay, I'm okay.
Stop saying, "Are you okay?"

15:26.792 --> 15:28.487
- Well, I just want to make sure
you're okay.

15:28.527 --> 15:30.927
Um, what... is there a bedroom
I should take?

15:30.963 --> 15:34.797
- Yeah, just go past
where we had the standoff,

15:34.833 --> 15:37.165
and it's the first bedroom
on the right.

15:37.202 --> 15:41.002
- Oh, past the... the creepy guy
with the bike helmet?

15:41.040 --> 15:47.001
- Yeah, where the crazy lady
was brandishing the oar.

15:47.046 --> 15:48.604
- She was scary.

15:48.647 --> 15:49.875
I hope she's gone.

15:49.915 --> 15:51.075
- Good night.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.447
- Do you think
we'll see her again?

15:52.484 --> 15:54.008
- Maybe.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.357
Can I come in?

17:27.146 --> 17:30.479
- There's glasses
on the windowsill,

17:30.516 --> 17:32.643
you know,
if you want to join me.

17:32.684 --> 17:34.151
- You sure?
- Yeah.

17:34.186 --> 17:36.552
- Thanks.

17:39.358 --> 17:42.759
One thing in common
with your little sister.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.490
- What, the lush factor?

17:44.530 --> 17:46.828
- Ah, the self-aware
lush factor.

17:46.865 --> 17:48.833
- Oh.
- Very important.

17:48.867 --> 17:51.859
Big difference.

17:51.904 --> 17:56.568
So you're on an island.

17:56.608 --> 18:00.806
It's 3:00 in the morning,
and you're drinking by yourself.

18:00.846 --> 18:03.007
- Yeah.

18:03.048 --> 18:06.882
- What's going on?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.147
- Really?

18:08.187 --> 18:10.212
- I'm not good for small talk,

18:10.255 --> 18:14.021
so I apologize
if I'm, uh, barging through

18:14.059 --> 18:15.720
the doors of your privacy
right now.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.956
- Yeah, it's okay.
You kind of are, but, it's...

18:17.996 --> 18:19.486
- I am.
I apologize.

18:19.531 --> 18:21.021
Let's talk about your slippers.

18:21.066 --> 18:23.864
- Okay.
Let's talk about my slippers.

18:23.902 --> 18:26.871
- Your slippers are awesome.

18:31.243 --> 18:35.304
- I just walked out
on a seven-year relationship.

18:35.347 --> 18:37.440
- Whoa.

18:39.551 --> 18:42.315
- Hence the tequila.
- Hence the tequila.

18:46.892 --> 18:49.554
- What's your story?

18:49.595 --> 18:50.994
Mm, nothing really.

18:51.029 --> 18:52.587
I just kind of had
a shitty year.

18:52.631 --> 18:56.397
You know, thought it'd be nice
to have a little sabbatical,

18:56.435 --> 18:58.630
get some alone time.

18:58.670 --> 19:00.035
- Okay, good place for it.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.334
- Good place for it.

19:01.373 --> 19:02.362
- Obviously.

19:02.407 --> 19:04.034
- Getting the alone time.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.476
But I got to say,
not so terrible

19:06.512 --> 19:09.106
to have a drinking buddy.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.548
- Yeah.

19:13.418 --> 19:15.886
- You are not
what I expected, Hannah.

19:15.921 --> 19:18.890
- How so?

19:18.924 --> 19:21.916
- You are, uh...
I don't know.

19:21.960 --> 19:26.056
Just not how Iris
described you to me, I guess.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.089
- How did she describe me?

19:28.133 --> 19:30.431
- She... well,
if you don't know already,

19:30.469 --> 19:32.596
she worships you
and looks up to you

19:32.638 --> 19:34.003
and thinks you are amazing.

19:34.039 --> 19:36.098
And she loves you.

19:36.141 --> 19:37.267
- Yeah?

19:37.309 --> 19:38.776
- It's true.

19:38.810 --> 19:40.175
- What else?

19:40.212 --> 19:41.304
- Well, I don't...

19:41.346 --> 19:42.506
- Give me the dirt!
Come on!

19:42.548 --> 19:44.106
- What am I supposed to say?
She loves you.

19:44.149 --> 19:45.377
She thinks you're amazing.

19:45.417 --> 19:46.975
- Well, I love her.
I think she's amazing.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.452
- Well, good.
Well, drink your drink.

19:48.487 --> 19:50.580
- You drink your drink.
Don't tell me to drink my drink.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.613
- Well, I'm drinking my drink.
You drink that one.

19:52.658 --> 19:56.094
Watch this.

19:56.128 --> 19:59.256
- Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

19:59.298 --> 20:00.663
- Wham!
Okay.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.098
Do you have any brothers
or sisters?

20:02.134 --> 20:04.432
- Now you're talking.
I had a brother.

20:06.672 --> 20:09.664
- That's right.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.699
I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.370
- I knew that.
- Don't.

20:13.412 --> 20:14.879
- That's... I'm sorry.
That's my bad.

20:14.913 --> 20:17.905
- Why are you sorry?
- I don't know.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.383
- There's nothing
to be sorry about.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.579
I used to have a brother,
and I don't anymore.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.417
And that's what it is, you know?

20:23.455 --> 20:25.013
It's like,

20:25.057 --> 20:26.649
it is what it is,
and it sucks.

20:26.692 --> 20:31.425
And it... you know, it was,

20:31.463 --> 20:33.328
you know,
it was terrible, obviously.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.128
But, um...
but I'm good.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.158
And, um, thank you for that.

20:37.202 --> 20:38.760
But it's not necessary.

20:41.840 --> 20:42.829
- To your brother.

20:42.874 --> 20:45.172
- To your sister.

20:45.210 --> 20:47.906
And her sister, being you.

20:47.946 --> 20:48.935
- That would be me.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.573
- Yeah.

20:50.616 --> 20:51.844
- I guess
I better drink then.

20:51.883 --> 20:53.976
- Come on.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.453
Mm-mm!
Mm-mm.

20:56.488 --> 20:57.853
- I can't.

20:57.889 --> 20:59.413
- Look, if we're gonna
drink to someone

20:59.458 --> 21:01.255
as awesome as your sister
and my dead brother,

21:01.293 --> 21:02.487
we're throwing
the shit back.

21:02.527 --> 21:04.017
- Okay.
- Come on, wham it.

21:04.062 --> 21:05.723
Mm!

21:05.764 --> 21:06.924
There it is.

21:06.965 --> 21:08.193
- Holy shit.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.724
- Yet another similarity
with you and Iris.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.293
I can talk her into drinking
anything.

21:12.337 --> 21:14.100
I can't believe you let me
talk you into that.

21:14.139 --> 21:15.606
That's really great.

21:15.641 --> 21:16.869
You want another one?

21:21.980 --> 21:23.470
Okay, my best friend
is your sister.

21:23.515 --> 21:24.948
- Right.

21:24.983 --> 21:27.042
- It's like a kind of in-law,
of sort, that makes us.

21:27.085 --> 21:31.579
You know what I'm saying?

21:31.623 --> 21:33.750
- What are you talking about?

21:33.792 --> 21:35.589
- I'm doing...
- Yeah, no, no, no, go, go, go.

21:35.627 --> 21:36.651
I cut you off when you were

21:36.695 --> 21:38.162
actually going
with something good.

21:38.196 --> 21:40.096
- I'm drawing
a brilliant parallel.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.259
Go again.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.496
Going down.

21:44.536 --> 21:47.994
Getting weird with the...

21:50.842 --> 21:52.901
All right,
let me tell you something.

21:53.645 --> 21:54.703
- Yeah!

21:54.746 --> 21:56.043
- All right,
it's not that I was...

21:56.081 --> 21:57.173
I was in love with her.

21:57.215 --> 21:58.705
I was totally fucking
in love with her.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.149
But what I was in love with

22:00.185 --> 22:02.915
was the potential that
she was holding that was me.

22:02.954 --> 22:04.182
- Right.
- Does that make sense?

22:04.222 --> 22:05.314
- Right.

22:05.357 --> 22:06.619
- That's what I was
in love with.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.750
- Right, right.
- Was that.

22:07.793 --> 22:09.351
- And then I started
to realize, like,

22:09.394 --> 22:13.763
it was like I gave her
all my, like, zhuzh,

22:13.799 --> 22:14.788
all my good stuff.

22:14.833 --> 22:15.857
Is this making any sense?

22:15.901 --> 22:17.129
- Yeah.
You shouldn't do that.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.864
- And, like... and she
wouldn't give it back.

22:18.904 --> 22:21.031
So, like, as the... as the...
as, like, the years went on

22:21.073 --> 22:23.541
and everything went on,
I was just, like...

22:23.575 --> 22:25.406
this is gonna sound
so fucking melodramatic.

22:25.444 --> 22:30.677
I was, like, this fucking,
like, little fucking bird,

22:30.716 --> 22:31.774
Like, in a cage.

22:31.817 --> 22:33.580
And finally she came over
and unlocked it,

22:33.618 --> 22:35.711
and I just sat there.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.085
- Wow.

22:37.122 --> 22:38.521
- I sat there
for three more months

22:38.557 --> 22:40.491
when she was hooking up
with a...

22:41.927 --> 22:46.023
Ugh, this woman, girl,
who's so much younger than me.

22:46.064 --> 22:47.190
And I just couldn't...

22:47.232 --> 22:48.893
I just sat there
and waited for her

22:48.934 --> 22:50.834
to be attracted
to me again

22:50.869 --> 22:54.600
or to just look at me
like I was, uh...

22:54.639 --> 22:55.901
- Whoa.

22:55.941 --> 22:57.875
We're gonna stop
this conversation.

22:57.909 --> 22:59.376
I got a sense of it, okay?

22:59.411 --> 23:00.901
And here's the deal.

23:00.946 --> 23:02.641
I've made a decision.

23:02.681 --> 23:03.978
Pam is a fucking moron.

23:04.015 --> 23:05.107
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

23:05.150 --> 23:06.617
- She's not really, but...

23:06.651 --> 23:07.777
- No, here's the deal.

23:07.819 --> 23:10.379
Look, for her to have
given you the sense

23:10.422 --> 23:11.753
in some way that you're not,

23:11.790 --> 23:14.725
Like, young enough
or good enough or pretty enough

23:14.760 --> 23:18.093
or just enough in general
is fucking bullshit.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.121
- It is, right?
- It's bullshit.

23:20.165 --> 23:25.000
Because what I see
across from me is...

23:25.036 --> 23:26.594
you have to...
you're gonna have to let me

23:26.638 --> 23:28.230
descend here for a second;
can I descend?

23:28.273 --> 23:29.365
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.670
I have to tell you something,

23:30.709 --> 23:32.404
and I don't want you
to take it the wrong way.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.275
It's to prove a point, okay?

23:34.312 --> 23:35.779
But it's about your butt.
So when I...

23:35.814 --> 23:37.645
What?

23:37.682 --> 23:39.741
- When I...
when I went to look for...

23:39.785 --> 23:41.275
- You are a fucker.

23:41.319 --> 23:42.513
- I am.

23:42.554 --> 23:44.749
- You were fucking peeping
in the fucking windows.

23:44.790 --> 23:45.984
You're a fucker.

23:46.024 --> 23:47.218
Give me some more.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.521
You are a fucking...
go ahead...

23:48.560 --> 23:50.460
yeah, no, I want to hear
your confession.

23:50.495 --> 23:51.723
Confess.

23:51.763 --> 23:52.855
- I tried to find the key.

23:52.898 --> 23:53.922
I went around the door,

23:53.965 --> 23:55.296
all innocent
up until that point.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.527
Innocent, innocent, innocent.

23:56.568 --> 23:58.058
Looking for the key,
total innocence,

23:58.103 --> 23:59.127
total innocence.

23:59.171 --> 24:03.574
Through the window:
your butt.

24:03.608 --> 24:04.734
- Pervert.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.141
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.406
- But you made me that way.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.743
- I made you that way?

24:08.780 --> 24:10.577
- 'Cause your butt is
fucking awesome, okay?

24:10.615 --> 24:11.604
- Can you not?

24:11.650 --> 24:12.878
- 'Cause it's, like, super soft.

24:12.918 --> 24:14.215
- How do you know
it's super soft?

24:14.252 --> 24:15.219
- 'Cause I could tell.

24:15.253 --> 24:16.845
- You're so fucking weird...

24:16.888 --> 24:18.150
- I know.
- And drunk right now.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.181
- I know.
I looked at it for a while.

24:20.225 --> 24:22.090
I got a good sense of it.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.424
And let me tell you
another thing

24:23.462 --> 24:25.453
that's even more inappropriate,

24:25.497 --> 24:28.227
but it's super safe
'cause you're a lesbian.

24:28.266 --> 24:32.635
If I were differently equipped

24:32.671 --> 24:37.404
or you were
differently inclined,

24:37.442 --> 24:40.002
this night might go
a very different way.

24:40.045 --> 24:41.342
- Really?

24:41.379 --> 24:43.040
- I'm just saying...
- Are you just saying?

24:43.081 --> 24:47.279
- I would be super open to that
in a whole other universe...

24:47.319 --> 24:48.786
- Okay.

24:48.820 --> 24:53.382
- Because... and this is just
serving to prove my point of,

24:53.425 --> 24:56.451
Like, you shouldn't feel
not awesome

24:56.495 --> 24:59.487
because she was
not interested in you.

24:59.531 --> 25:01.089
There will be a lot of people...

25:01.132 --> 25:03.100
- Well, I didn't say
she wasn't interested in me.

25:03.134 --> 25:04.499
The fucking thing
ran its course.

25:04.536 --> 25:05.560
But anyway, go ahead.

25:05.604 --> 25:06.696
I like it.
I like it.

25:06.738 --> 25:13.576
- To your gorgeous,
supple, soft,

25:13.612 --> 25:17.070
sexy motherfucking butt.

25:19.117 --> 25:21.449
- And all the other things
that I might be thinking about

25:21.486 --> 25:23.647
except for the fact that
I'm not thinking about them.

25:23.688 --> 25:27.021
- I'm just saying...
- Anyway, the point is, you,

25:27.058 --> 25:28.389
you're never going to be happy

25:28.426 --> 25:30.087
if you're eating
this fucking bird food.

25:30.128 --> 25:31.857
You think... you know why
you feel like a bird?

25:31.897 --> 25:33.489
- I love that food.
- You feel like a bird?

25:33.532 --> 25:35.159
Okay, what the fuck is this?
It's a turd.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.326
You can't eat these things.

25:36.368 --> 25:40.964
I am here, Dr. Jack,
to fix you, okay?

25:41.006 --> 25:44.407
So I'm gonna make you round,
tall filet, super awesome.

25:44.442 --> 25:46.034
Grocery store.
Cook it medium-rare.

25:46.077 --> 25:47.840
- I can't do it.
- With the butter.

25:47.879 --> 25:50.347
- I can't eat meat.
You can make me something else.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.906
- Okay, I'll make you
something else.

25:51.950 --> 25:57.081
I'll make you a super
awesome steak medium-rare

25:57.122 --> 25:59.113
with the butter
and the blue cheese

25:59.157 --> 26:01.853
and the truffle oil drizzled
over the French fries.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.622
And I'm gonna put this plate
in front of you.

26:03.662 --> 26:05.357
And it's gonna be
totally different.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.297
It'll be a change of pace.

26:07.332 --> 26:09.562
But you are out of the cage now,
my friend.

26:09.601 --> 26:12.434
And if you want to fucking fly,
you're gonna start with a steak.

26:12.470 --> 26:13.903
That's all I'm saying.
- Let's do it.

26:13.939 --> 26:15.463
- All right, we're going
to the store...

26:15.507 --> 26:16.565
- No, let's do it.

26:16.608 --> 26:18.041
- I'm gonna fucking cook you
a meal.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.101
- Hey!

26:25.150 --> 26:26.515
All right.

26:26.551 --> 26:30.317
I'm gonna take you up
on your offer.

26:30.355 --> 26:32.118
- What are you doing?

26:32.157 --> 26:33.419
- I haven't, uh,

26:33.458 --> 26:35.483
been on that bicycle
in quite some time, but...

26:35.527 --> 26:37.290
- What are you... what?

26:37.329 --> 26:40.821
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:40.865 --> 26:43.493
Are you serious?
- Yeah.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.867
I'm single.
You're single.

26:45.904 --> 26:48.031
- I'm single.

26:48.073 --> 26:50.200
- I mean, maybe it's a bad idea.
- It's not a bad idea.

26:50.241 --> 26:52.175
- No, maybe it's a bad idea.
- It's not a bad idea.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.235
- No, we shouldn't do it.
You're a straight guy.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.440
- I'm looking at your boobs.
- It might be too much.

26:56.481 --> 26:58.676
It might be too much for you.

26:58.717 --> 27:00.582
Too much for you to handle.

27:03.588 --> 27:04.577
What?

27:04.623 --> 27:07.251
- You're serious.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.418
- I don't know.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.052
I mean,
I'm game if you're game.

27:13.098 --> 27:14.656
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

27:14.699 --> 27:17.497
- Get rid of this.
Get rid of this.

27:17.535 --> 27:19.400
Holy shit.

27:34.252 --> 27:35.446
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.352
Shit, shit, shit, I don't have...
I don't...

27:37.389 --> 27:40.358
I didn't bring a...
I don't have a condom.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.587
Well, I didn't...
I thought I was gonna be alone.

27:42.627 --> 27:44.652
- Condom!

27:44.696 --> 27:48.393
- Oh, fuck.

27:48.433 --> 27:49.661
Saran Wrap?

27:49.701 --> 27:51.066
- I think I know where
there's one.

27:51.102 --> 27:53.969
- Okay, oh, all right.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.838
Uh...

27:56.875 --> 27:58.866
Um...

28:00.879 --> 28:03.939
Okay.

28:13.291 --> 28:14.724
Wait, wait, wait.
Stay right there.

28:14.759 --> 28:16.192
Don't move, don't move,
don't move.

28:16.227 --> 28:17.285
I got to show you something.

28:17.328 --> 28:18.989
I've always wanted to do this.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.497
Okay.
You ready?

28:20.532 --> 28:22.898
- Yes.

28:22.934 --> 28:25.266
- Ta-da!

28:25.303 --> 28:26.930
- All right.
- You're very underwhelmed.

28:26.971 --> 28:28.404
Okay, never mind.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.374
- Wait.
All right.

28:30.408 --> 28:31.705
I'm gonna do it.

28:31.743 --> 28:34.075
- Whoa, you're really
going for it.

28:34.112 --> 28:35.477
- Is that on?

28:35.513 --> 28:37.777
- Uh, snap it.
Snap it.

28:37.816 --> 28:38.874
Okay, good.

28:38.917 --> 28:40.145
Give me this.
Give me this.

28:40.185 --> 28:41.584
- Okay, sorry.

28:41.619 --> 28:44.816
Okay, I got it.
I got it.

28:44.856 --> 28:46.118
Okay.

28:46.157 --> 28:48.557
- Let me get these off.

28:48.593 --> 28:51.460
- Yeah.
- Okay.

28:51.496 --> 28:53.828
- Wow.
Wow.

28:53.865 --> 28:55.059
Okay.

28:57.936 --> 29:00.063
- Okay.

29:00.105 --> 29:01.231
- Oh, my God.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.035
- Oh, shit, you're amazing.

29:11.883 --> 29:13.180
- Oh, sorry.

29:13.218 --> 29:15.243
Wait a second.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.388
Oh, shit.
I squealed.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.515
Sorry.

29:25.063 --> 29:26.792
- Did you...
okay.

29:26.831 --> 29:28.799
- Yeah, sorry.

29:28.833 --> 29:31.028
That was...

29:31.069 --> 29:34.004
it wasn't supposed to be
that fast.

29:34.038 --> 29:37.997
- Oh, good.

29:38.042 --> 29:39.407
- I can... I can help, uh...

29:39.444 --> 29:40.502
- No, it's okay.

29:40.545 --> 29:41.739
- Finish for you, if you want.

29:41.780 --> 29:42.838
- Oh, no.

29:42.881 --> 29:43.848
Thank you.

29:43.882 --> 29:45.577
- You sure?
- Yeah.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.608
- Okay.
- Ow, you're on my hair.

29:47.652 --> 29:49.415
- Sorry.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.217
- All right, um...

29:52.724 --> 29:54.385
Well...

29:57.929 --> 29:59.760
You want to snuggle?

29:59.798 --> 30:01.789
- Yeah.
- Okay.

30:01.833 --> 30:04.063
- Go for it.
- Okay.

30:04.102 --> 30:06.366
- Maybe not that close.

30:06.404 --> 30:07.701
- We should get some...

30:07.739 --> 30:12.039
we should get some water too
before we go to sleep.

30:12.076 --> 30:13.543
- Okay.

30:16.581 --> 30:18.879
- Good night.

30:21.753 --> 30:23.516
Thank you.

31:11.836 --> 31:13.804
- She's here, she's here,
she's here, she's here.

31:13.838 --> 31:15.066
Get up, get up, get up, get up.

31:15.106 --> 31:17.301
Oh, ew!

31:17.342 --> 31:19.742
Oh, shit.

31:19.777 --> 31:20.937
Fuck.
Where'd it go?

31:20.979 --> 31:22.310
Where'd it go?
Where'd it go?

31:22.347 --> 31:25.714
Where'd it go?

31:25.750 --> 31:26.944
Okay, you have to get up.

31:26.985 --> 31:28.384
Iris is in the driveway.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.853
Dude, she's in the driveway.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.015
Give me some tissues.

31:32.056 --> 31:35.025
Give me some tissue.
Come on.

31:35.059 --> 31:36.686
Okay.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.059
Very important, okay?

31:38.096 --> 31:39.222
She cannot know about this.

31:39.264 --> 31:41.232
I am running or something.

31:41.266 --> 31:42.665
You are sleeping.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.258
And we're good, okay?

31:44.302 --> 31:45.701
Just...

31:48.606 --> 31:50.039
- What?

31:55.213 --> 31:56.942
- Jack?

32:12.230 --> 32:14.425
What the fuck is that?

32:17.168 --> 32:18.931
- Hey, Bean.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.198
- Oh, my God.

32:20.238 --> 32:21.398
- What's up?

32:21.439 --> 32:23.236
- Puppet?
What the fuck?

32:23.274 --> 32:25.708
Oh, my goodness!

32:25.743 --> 32:28.211
What are you doing here?

32:28.246 --> 32:29.440
- Oh.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.970
- Oh, it's so nice to see you.

32:31.015 --> 32:33.677
I didn't know
you were going to be here.

32:33.718 --> 32:35.709
- Yeah, it's a long story.
- Did you just wake up?

32:35.753 --> 32:36.777
You okay?

32:36.821 --> 32:38.948
These are cute.
These are really...

32:38.990 --> 32:40.651
- Holy cow!

32:40.692 --> 32:43.024
- And you've met...
oh, Jesus Christ.

32:43.061 --> 32:44.085
- What?

32:44.128 --> 32:45.595
- What have you come as?

32:45.630 --> 32:47.188
- I was on a run.

32:47.231 --> 32:48.425
- Here she is.

32:48.466 --> 32:49.956
- Hannah showed me
a great path, and...

32:50.001 --> 32:51.195
- Jane Fonda.

32:51.235 --> 32:52.361
- Oh, cut it out.

32:52.403 --> 32:53.734
- Oh, yummy.
You're sweaty.

32:53.771 --> 32:55.170
- Oh, what are you doing here?

32:55.206 --> 32:56.400
What is going on?

32:56.441 --> 32:57.601
- Did you meet my sister?

32:57.642 --> 32:59.007
I've been wanting you
to meet her.

32:59.043 --> 33:00.169
- I did.
We met last night.

33:00.211 --> 33:02.509
Yes, we did.
- How nice is this?

33:02.547 --> 33:04.811
I've been wanting you guys
to meet for so long.

33:04.849 --> 33:07.113
Haven't I been talking about it?
And it's weird.

33:07.151 --> 33:08.982
It's weird that you haven't met,
so I love it.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.248
- I know.
It's crazy.

33:10.288 --> 33:11.380
How... what... why are you...

33:11.422 --> 33:12.889
how did the...
what are you doing here?

33:12.924 --> 33:14.551
- I got off work.
I just was, like...

33:14.592 --> 33:16.355
they moved a shoot
and then axed another one,

33:16.394 --> 33:17.759
so I was, like, "Peace out.

33:17.795 --> 33:19.729
I'm gonna go
and annoy my friend."

33:19.764 --> 33:21.561
- That's so great!

33:21.599 --> 33:23.226
- This is amazing
that she's here as well.

33:23.267 --> 33:24.700
- I know.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.761
You were like, "Go up
for a solo sabbatical except"...

33:26.804 --> 33:27.828
- I know.
I know.

33:27.872 --> 33:29.305
You're supposed
to have alone time,

33:29.340 --> 33:31.069
and now you're, like,
double whammy!

33:32.577 --> 33:33.635
- Two of them here.

33:33.678 --> 33:34.940
- That was a big run.

33:34.979 --> 33:36.503
- Yeah, it was really good.

33:36.547 --> 33:38.071
- Yeah.
I need to pee.

33:38.116 --> 33:39.583
I'm literally
gonna pee my pants.

33:39.617 --> 33:41.642
I got you provisions and stuff.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.950
I love that you're here.

33:43.988 --> 33:46.115
Where did you guys sleep?

33:48.026 --> 33:49.994
- That was a bit much.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.620
It's, like, pouring off
your head.

33:54.665 --> 33:56.428
- So... yeah.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.503
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.736
- Took my room.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.677
- I hate my room.

34:07.712 --> 34:09.077
- You do hate your room.

34:09.112 --> 34:10.637
Don't be weird
and change the sheets.

34:10.681 --> 34:14.844
It's fine.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.478
- I broke up with Pam.

34:16.521 --> 34:18.318
- What?

34:18.356 --> 34:20.221
Holy shit.

34:20.257 --> 34:21.850
Why...
when?

34:21.893 --> 34:23.053
- A couple of days ago.

34:23.094 --> 34:25.527
I got up here yesterday.

34:25.563 --> 34:26.552
I hitchhiked up.

34:26.597 --> 34:27.893
- You didn't hitchhike up.

34:27.931 --> 34:29.900
Please don't hitchhike.
It's so dangerous.

34:29.934 --> 34:31.697
Shit.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.293
- I had no idea that...

34:33.337 --> 34:34.429
are you all right?

34:34.472 --> 34:35.996
Please don't change
the sheets.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.167
- I want to change the sheets.
- Don't change the sheets.

34:38.208 --> 34:40.335
- Let me change the sheets.
I want to change the sheets.

34:40.378 --> 34:45.110
- I want to talk to you about...

34:45.149 --> 34:51.088
I had no idea you guys
were having trouble.

34:51.121 --> 34:54.523
Hannah.

34:54.559 --> 34:58.154
Why didn't you call me?

34:58.196 --> 34:59.788
- I don't know;
I knew we were in trouble

34:59.831 --> 35:01.423
when we weren't
being physical anymore.

35:01.466 --> 35:03.058
But, I mean,
that was totally my fault.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.228
I was just so fucking angry
with her all the time.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.203
- Yeah, of course you were.
She's suffocating.

35:07.238 --> 35:08.671
- No.
Well, she was suffocating.

35:08.706 --> 35:09.673
- She was suffocating.

35:09.707 --> 35:11.140
- No, but it was me too.

35:11.175 --> 35:13.803
It was because
I was buying in to this...

35:13.845 --> 35:15.335
I was...

35:15.379 --> 35:17.108
what did I say to you
last night?

35:17.148 --> 35:19.673
I had a good metaphor
for it last night.

35:19.717 --> 35:21.309
- Did you guys talk
about this last night?

35:21.352 --> 35:22.341
- Yes, I was shitfaced,

35:22.386 --> 35:23.717
and I was
pouring out my heart.

35:23.754 --> 35:27.087
- You know what?
I am gonna need some herbs.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.093
Would you mind getting something
from the garden?

35:29.127 --> 35:30.788
- Do you need it right now,
or do you want to...

35:30.828 --> 35:32.591
- It would be great
so that it could marinate.

35:32.630 --> 35:33.858
- What?

35:33.898 --> 35:35.991
- I do feel like sooner
rather than later would be good,

35:36.033 --> 35:37.125
just so they can marinate.

35:37.168 --> 35:38.362
- Okay.
Yeah, yeah.

35:38.402 --> 35:40.233
Um, but I want to know...
I want to know what the...

35:40.271 --> 35:41.329
- I'll remember where I was.

35:41.372 --> 35:42.361
- I didn't know any of this,

35:42.406 --> 35:43.600
what the breaking point...

35:43.641 --> 35:45.302
- It's not the kind of stuff
you talk about.

35:45.343 --> 35:46.605
- I know.
- Yeah.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.111
- All right,
what do you want me to do?

35:48.146 --> 35:49.408
- Um, real quick.

35:49.447 --> 35:50.914
I've been thinking,

35:50.948 --> 35:53.007
since the bottle of tequila
was pretty much empty,

35:53.050 --> 35:55.484
I think the way we pitch it is,
you were here drinking,

35:55.520 --> 35:57.454
and I came in, and we talked
for, like, 20 minutes.

35:57.488 --> 35:58.785
Then you went to bed.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.381
I stayed up
finishing the tequila.

36:00.424 --> 36:02.449
And then that way, it's like,
we hung out a little bit

36:02.493 --> 36:03.960
but not so much
that it's suspicious.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.826
You know what I'm saying?
Is that cool with you?

36:05.863 --> 36:07.421
- What are you talking about?

36:07.465 --> 36:10.127
I mean, seriously,
what are you talking about?

36:10.168 --> 36:12.500
- Okay,
don't you think we both agree

36:12.537 --> 36:14.232
it's better
if Iris just doesn't know?

36:14.272 --> 36:15.830
- Why?

36:15.873 --> 36:19.639
- Because she's your sister,
and I'm her best friend...

36:19.677 --> 36:20.803
- Yeah?
- And it's weird.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.073
- Weird, what?

36:22.113 --> 36:23.478
Well, it's weird
that we had sex.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.141
I mean, I'm not particularly
proud of it.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.707
But I don't think
she would give a shit.

36:26.751 --> 36:28.343
- What do you mean
you're not proud of it?

36:28.386 --> 36:30.354
- Come on.
Whatever, anyway, go ahead.

36:30.388 --> 36:32.322
You want me to make up a story

36:32.356 --> 36:34.256
to throw her off the track

36:34.292 --> 36:36.419
so that she doesn't know
that we had sex?

36:36.460 --> 36:38.428
- That sounds terrible
when you say it like that.

36:38.462 --> 36:39.486
- Right.
- Okay?

36:39.530 --> 36:40.929
- Do you have a thing
for my sister?

36:40.965 --> 36:42.159
- I knew
you were gonna say this.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.758
This is why I didn't want
to say anything.

36:43.801 --> 36:45.200
I do not have a thing
for your sister.

36:45.236 --> 36:46.430
- You have a thing
for my sister.

36:46.470 --> 36:47.903
- I don't have a thing
for your sister.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.065
Here's the deal.
- Okay.

36:49.106 --> 36:50.471
- I think it would be bad
for all of us

36:50.508 --> 36:51.475
if Iris knows about this.

36:51.509 --> 36:52.874
I'm not just thinking...

36:52.910 --> 36:54.901
- You are freaking me out
on so many levels right now.

36:54.946 --> 36:57.107
- You don't think she'd be upset
if you told her we had sex?

36:57.148 --> 36:58.672
- I don't think
she would give a shit, no.

36:58.716 --> 36:59.978
- Wow.
- I hate to break it to you...

37:00.017 --> 37:01.075
- Hi!

37:01.118 --> 37:02.210
- Hey!
I've got sage as well.

37:02.253 --> 37:03.550
I don't know if that's any good.

37:03.588 --> 37:05.988
- Uh, sage is great actually.

37:06.023 --> 37:07.183
Perfect.
Thank you.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.487
- So what was the point when...

37:08.526 --> 37:10.084
what was it
when you decided that...

37:10.127 --> 37:12.220
- You know what? I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

37:12.263 --> 37:13.594
- No.
But I haven't heard any of it.

37:13.631 --> 37:15.030
- I'm starting to get
so irritable,

37:15.066 --> 37:16.499
because it's just
a bad topic.

37:16.534 --> 37:18.297
- Let's listen to some music.

37:18.336 --> 37:19.394
Why don't we do that?

37:19.437 --> 37:20.404
- I'll put some music on.

37:20.438 --> 37:22.303
- Yeah, let's do music.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.501
That sounds good.

37:26.611 --> 37:28.511
- Did she tell you about
the Pam thing last night?

37:28.546 --> 37:29.570
- What's that?

37:29.614 --> 37:30.638
- Did she tell you about Pam?

37:30.681 --> 37:31.705
- We touched on it.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.580
- How's this?
- It's okay.

37:33.618 --> 37:35.711
- Can you not talk about me
when I'm in the same area?

37:35.753 --> 37:37.983
- I'm just saying,
I think I'm a little upset

37:38.022 --> 37:40.889
that this guy is, like,
all clued up on your breakup

37:40.925 --> 37:42.222
and I don't know anything.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.818
- Here's the deal.
New rule.

37:43.861 --> 37:46.728
No talking behind anybody's
backs in this house, all right?

37:46.764 --> 37:48.959
- All right.
- Um, we don't do that.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.558
- Okay.
- Yeah, good.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.933
- Okay, I know you don't want
to talk about it anymore.

37:52.970 --> 37:54.267
That's fine.

37:54.305 --> 37:55.465
- Yeah.
- That's totally fine.

37:55.506 --> 37:56.564
- Let's just move on.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.302
- All right.
- Sounds good to me.

38:03.714 --> 38:05.739
This place is incredible.
- Mm-hmm.

38:05.783 --> 38:08.308
- I know you said at some point
it was renovated, but...

38:08.352 --> 38:10.377
- You don't understand
how beautiful this place was.

38:10.421 --> 38:11.718
- You don't understand.
It was...

38:11.756 --> 38:13.383
- I mean, it was insane.
- It was beautiful.

38:13.424 --> 38:16.325
- It was just so pure
and gorgeous,

38:16.360 --> 38:18.419
and then Marilyn came in
and just eradicated

38:18.462 --> 38:19.986
any memory of us.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.090
And, so the house, yes,
is very beautiful...

38:22.133 --> 38:23.828
- Without the stink of us.

38:23.868 --> 38:25.563
- Yeah.

38:25.603 --> 38:28.333
- But Marilyn's only got
a couple more years left.

38:28.372 --> 38:29.566
- It's two and a half, three.

38:29.607 --> 38:30.972
- Two and a half,
three more years.

38:31.008 --> 38:32.908
- Yeah, I think so.
- What, are you...

38:32.943 --> 38:35.002
I'm sorry, what?
Three to go?

38:35.046 --> 38:37.571
- The ten-year itch.
- Mm-hmm.

38:37.615 --> 38:40.550
- Okay, he was with her mum
for ten years,

38:40.584 --> 38:42.711
had an affair with my mum,
who was his secretary.

38:42.753 --> 38:44.721
- Got your mom Lenora pregnant.
- Yes.

38:44.755 --> 38:46.279
- Married her.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.292
- Moved to London.
- Moved to London.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.021
- Got bored of Lenora,
and then he moved on.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.495
And then he kind of philandered
around for, like, seven years.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.862
- He went through
his crazy Warren Beatty phase.

38:54.899 --> 38:56.730
The funny thing, though,
about those years,

38:56.767 --> 38:58.598
when he was so bad
with the ladies,

38:58.636 --> 39:00.501
he was so good with us,
because that was...

39:00.538 --> 39:01.732
- He wasn't.

39:01.772 --> 39:03.239
- No, but that was, like,
six summers

39:03.274 --> 39:04.707
that it was just
the three of us here.

39:04.742 --> 39:06.175
- I know, but you were okay
with that.

39:06.210 --> 39:07.404
I had no respect for that.

39:07.445 --> 39:09.743
He just went... he dodged
from one to the other,

39:09.780 --> 39:11.145
and it was gross.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.376
- That's so crazy.

39:12.416 --> 39:14.850
So he would just, like,
date all these women,

39:14.885 --> 39:16.375
Like, for short periods
of time

39:16.420 --> 39:17.944
with not a lot
of emotional investment?

39:17.988 --> 39:19.387
- Yeah, it was horrible.

39:19.423 --> 39:21.687
- And they were very similar,
and then he would just move on?

39:21.726 --> 39:22.988
- Yeah.
- God, that's just weird.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.289
Who does that?
Oh!

39:24.328 --> 39:26.193
And the patterns emerge!

39:26.230 --> 39:27.788
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

39:27.832 --> 39:30.801
Skinny Jeans George,
Skinny Jeans Harry,

39:30.835 --> 39:32.132
Skinny Jeans Vinnie.

39:32.169 --> 39:34.967
Vinnie lasted
for at least two weeks.

39:35.005 --> 39:36.233
He was one of the longer ones.

39:36.273 --> 39:37.740
- I don't like dating.
You know that.

39:37.775 --> 39:38.969
I don't like dating.

39:39.009 --> 39:41.136
I don't like the...
I don't like it.

39:41.178 --> 39:42.577
I get bored.
I don't like it.

39:42.613 --> 39:44.103
- Do you know how
the Iris dating scheme

39:44.148 --> 39:45.115
works these days?

39:45.149 --> 39:46.946
No, you don't.

39:46.984 --> 39:48.645
- Okay, this is basically
how it works,

39:48.686 --> 39:50.051
I mean, in a nutshell.

39:50.087 --> 39:52.954
So they come in
with the skinny jeans

39:52.990 --> 39:55.925
that... yes, skinnier than these,
by the way.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.861
Then we've got
the rocker stud belt,

39:58.896 --> 40:00.454
the Converse, no socks,

40:00.498 --> 40:04.434
tongue open, no shoelaces,
the swoopy haircut.

40:04.468 --> 40:06.595
- Which you have right now,
by the way.

40:06.637 --> 40:08.969
- Well, I have it
'cause I have hair problems.

40:09.006 --> 40:10.371
These guys are young enough.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.137
They should not be swooping.

40:12.176 --> 40:14.235
It starts out
usually on a Friday,

40:14.278 --> 40:15.905
'cause she met him
at a coffee shop.

40:15.946 --> 40:18.346
Saturday night, we go to either
Fleet Foxes or Band of Horses...

40:18.382 --> 40:20.145
- I like Fleet Foxes.

40:20.184 --> 40:22.277
- Or some sort of
Light in The Attic show.

40:22.319 --> 40:24.344
And then she takes them
to the greasy spoon breakfast

40:24.388 --> 40:25.946
the next morning.

40:25.990 --> 40:27.821
She's like, "I'm such
the greasy spoon girl,"

40:27.858 --> 40:29.758
and then they get
very, very excited about her.

40:29.794 --> 40:31.989
And the next weekend they call,
and she does coffee.

40:32.029 --> 40:33.291
And then it's done.

40:33.330 --> 40:35.161
- And why are you
almost defending them?

40:35.199 --> 40:37.360
You hate all of the guys
that I've been out with.

40:37.401 --> 40:38.959
You've hated all of them.

40:39.003 --> 40:40.095
- Well, the problem is...

40:40.137 --> 40:41.627
- I get very bored.
You know that.

40:41.672 --> 40:43.162
- You have great taste in life,

40:43.207 --> 40:45.300
and you have
terrible taste in men.

40:45.342 --> 40:47.776
- You have terrible taste
in clothes.

40:47.812 --> 40:49.109
- Of course I do.
I never said...

40:49.146 --> 40:51.273
- Those denim shorts are
a horror show.

40:51.315 --> 40:53.579
- Don't... don't talk about
the jean shorts.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.346
Don't, don't.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

40:55.386 --> 40:56.944
- The fact that
you've somehow managed

40:56.987 --> 40:59.512
to get the inner seam higher
than the outer seam

40:59.557 --> 41:00.990
is so creepy.

41:01.025 --> 41:02.686
- God is in the details.
I'm sorry.

41:02.726 --> 41:04.284
- I never want to see
those things again.

41:04.328 --> 41:07.195
- Remember the guy who asked you
to cut your bush?

41:09.633 --> 41:10.725
Remember?

41:10.768 --> 41:12.235
The guy that you
were hooking up with

41:12.269 --> 41:13.702
that told you to trim
your bush and...

41:13.737 --> 41:15.170
- Okay, we're good.
- No, no, no.

41:15.206 --> 41:16.639
She came home in tears,

41:16.674 --> 41:18.266
because she was hooking up
with this guy.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.640
Remember that guy?

41:19.677 --> 41:21.372
And she had a little poof
in her underwear.

41:21.412 --> 41:23.073
- Okay, you know...

41:23.113 --> 41:25.638
- And she's like, "I didn't know
I'm supposed to trim my bush."

41:26.917 --> 41:28.077
- I was so embarrassed.

41:28.118 --> 41:29.915
- And I was, like,
the bad older sister

41:29.954 --> 41:31.216
'cause I didn't tell her.

41:31.255 --> 41:32.381
- What the fuck are you doing?

41:32.423 --> 41:33.720
I didn't.
It was...

41:35.459 --> 41:37.689
- Anyway, that's the only
boyfriend story I remember.

41:37.728 --> 41:40.856
- You suck.
That is so wrong, by the way.

41:40.898 --> 41:41.990
- What?
- That's very wrong.

41:42.032 --> 41:43.465
- These are the guys...

41:43.501 --> 41:45.196
- Okay, we're good,
we're good, we're good.

41:45.236 --> 41:46.669
We're done.
We're done.

41:46.704 --> 41:48.831
Okay?

41:48.873 --> 41:50.272
- Okay, we're done.

41:50.307 --> 41:52.707
I'm just gonna eat another vat
of mashed potatoes.

41:52.743 --> 41:54.506
- How are you liking
those mashed potatoes?

41:54.545 --> 41:56.638
- They're outrageous.

41:56.680 --> 41:57.840
- Yeah?
They taste good?

41:57.882 --> 41:59.076
- Mm-hmm.

41:59.116 --> 42:00.777
- How vegan do they taste
to you?

42:04.922 --> 42:06.651
Come on.

42:06.690 --> 42:09.056
I put a dollop of butter in.
That was it.

42:09.093 --> 42:10.287
Don't rinse out.
Come on.

42:10.327 --> 42:11.988
You've been plowing through
those things.

42:12.029 --> 42:13.291
Do you know why
they tasted good?

42:13.330 --> 42:15.059
Because they have dairy in them.
That's why.

42:15.099 --> 42:16.999
- Why would you do that?
- Because I felt like it.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.764
- That's five pounds of fear
right there that I just ate.

42:21.405 --> 42:22.497
- It was meant to be a joke

42:22.540 --> 42:23.973
just 'cause...
to see if you liked it.

42:24.008 --> 42:25.339
- It was meant to be a joke.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.934
- I mean,
it's just so not cool.

42:26.977 --> 42:28.467
- Okay, okay.

42:28.512 --> 42:29.774
You're right.
It's not cool.

42:29.813 --> 42:31.246
Are you allergic to butter,
though?

42:31.282 --> 42:34.718
- No, I'm emotionally allergic
to butter.

42:34.752 --> 42:36.549
- I'm sorry.
It was just a little bit.

42:36.587 --> 42:38.282
It was just a tablespoon.

42:38.322 --> 42:39.812
I like butter
in my mashed potato,

42:39.857 --> 42:42.348
and that was all it was.

42:45.462 --> 42:47.225
- All right.
- Don't, Hannah.

42:47.264 --> 42:50.529
- That was delicious
and inhumane and...

42:50.568 --> 42:52.092
I'll see you guys
in the morning.

42:52.136 --> 42:53.728
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

42:53.771 --> 42:55.102
- I love you,
but I don't like you.

42:55.139 --> 42:56.436
- All right.

42:56.473 --> 42:58.168
- Thank you, Jack.

42:58.208 --> 43:00.199
- Good night, Hannah.

43:56.433 --> 43:57.400
- Hannah?

43:57.434 --> 43:58.401
- Hmm?

43:58.435 --> 44:00.869
- Hello.

44:00.904 --> 44:02.064
- I'm sleeping.

44:02.106 --> 44:04.574
- I know.

44:04.608 --> 44:06.007
I can't sleep.

44:08.512 --> 44:11.572
It's because I'm so excited
that you're here.

44:11.615 --> 44:13.048
- Well, try.

44:13.083 --> 44:14.050
- What?

44:14.084 --> 44:15.051
- Try.

44:15.085 --> 44:16.780
- I can't.

44:22.393 --> 44:23.883
- Do you want to talk?

44:23.927 --> 44:24.916
- Mm-mm.

44:26.563 --> 44:27.552
- Go to bed.

44:27.598 --> 44:29.566
- I can't.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.090
- Well, sleep here, but, shh.

44:31.135 --> 44:32.466
- Okay.

44:39.009 --> 44:40.738
Can I just have one question?

44:40.778 --> 44:43.372
- Hmm?

44:43.414 --> 44:45.575
- Do you like Jack?

44:49.920 --> 44:51.251
- Yeah, he's all right.

44:51.288 --> 44:52.414
- Hmm?

44:52.456 --> 44:54.617
- I said he's all right.

44:54.658 --> 44:57.149
- What do you think of him?

44:58.762 --> 44:59.729
- I don't know.

44:59.763 --> 45:01.890
I just met him.

45:01.932 --> 45:03.331
- Yeah, but, you know,

45:03.367 --> 45:07.133
you're very good
at working people out.

45:11.175 --> 45:13.405
- I don't know.
He seems like a nice guy.

45:13.444 --> 45:14.570
- Mm-hmm.

45:14.611 --> 45:17.671
- He's a good cook.

45:17.715 --> 45:18.841
Asshole.

45:18.882 --> 45:21.180
- Sorry about the potato.

45:24.855 --> 45:26.982
I hate that bush story.

45:27.024 --> 45:28.048
- I'm sorry about that.

45:28.092 --> 45:30.185
- I, like, hate it so much.

45:30.227 --> 45:33.162
It's so, so embarrassing.

45:33.197 --> 45:34.289
- It's a good story.

45:34.331 --> 45:37.596
- Yeah, for you.

45:40.070 --> 45:42.231
- I don't know.
He's funny, I guess.

45:42.272 --> 45:44.433
- He's very funny.

45:44.475 --> 45:47.933
- And full of himself.

45:47.978 --> 45:49.707
- Well, it's because
he's nervous, though.

45:49.747 --> 45:52.875
He just gets a little posture-y
when he's nervous.

45:54.685 --> 45:57.279
He's really smart.

45:59.289 --> 46:01.416
- So do you like him?

46:01.458 --> 46:04.052
- Yeah, he's my friend.

46:06.063 --> 46:11.763
- No, I mean, do you <i> like him</i>
like him?

46:14.271 --> 46:16.432
- Yeah.

46:20.444 --> 46:23.538
I think I'm in love with him.

46:29.753 --> 46:31.380
- Wow.

46:31.421 --> 46:33.889
- Yeah.

46:33.924 --> 46:36.950
Do you think that's weird?

46:36.994 --> 46:39.986
- No.

46:46.904 --> 46:48.098
No.

46:48.138 --> 46:51.232
- Because of Tom,
I think it might be weird.

46:53.777 --> 46:56.610
- I don't know.

47:07.057 --> 47:10.686
- He made this, like,
really drunken pass at me once.

47:10.727 --> 47:15.357
And it was right after
I broke up with Tom.

47:17.434 --> 47:21.768
And it was completely
embarrassing, but...

47:24.107 --> 47:26.234
He was so upset
the next day,

47:26.276 --> 47:30.303
you know, mortified.

47:30.347 --> 47:32.338
And...

47:36.954 --> 47:41.550
And I was kind of happy
that it happened.

47:45.362 --> 47:49.264
So I guess I thought then
that I shouldn't...

47:49.299 --> 47:51.233
shouldn't tell him.

47:55.405 --> 47:57.737
Do you think that
I should tell him?

48:02.312 --> 48:04.007
No.

48:04.047 --> 48:05.844
- No, not no.

48:05.883 --> 48:08.249
Uh-uh...

48:08.285 --> 48:11.152
- He's so sweet.

48:14.157 --> 48:16.022
- I think you should sleep
on it.

48:16.059 --> 48:18.357
- Sleep on it?

48:18.395 --> 48:19.657
I thought you were gonna say,

48:19.696 --> 48:21.425
"I think you should
sleep with him."

48:23.000 --> 48:25.195
- That's my usual advice.

48:27.905 --> 48:30.100
- I just think
I might fuck everything up,

48:30.140 --> 48:35.601
because maybe
we know each other too well,

48:35.646 --> 48:36.908
you know?

48:36.947 --> 48:40.212
And he'd be totally
weirded out, and...

48:45.722 --> 48:46.848
- Sleep on it.

48:46.890 --> 48:47.879
- Okay.

48:49.960 --> 48:51.291
- In your own bed.

48:51.328 --> 48:52.659
- Okay.

48:54.865 --> 48:56.457
- I'm exhausted.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.127
- Okay.

48:58.168 --> 48:59.135
- I love you.

48:59.169 --> 49:01.194
- I love you.

49:03.173 --> 49:06.973
It's nice to see you.

49:07.010 --> 49:08.773
- So good to see you,
Peanut.

49:17.054 --> 49:18.954
- Okay.

49:45.582 --> 49:47.311
- Hi, Stink Bomb.

49:47.351 --> 49:48.443
- Hey.

49:48.485 --> 49:50.112
How are you?

49:50.153 --> 49:51.780
- What are you doing?

49:51.822 --> 49:52.880
- Just chilling.

49:52.923 --> 49:54.788
Reading.

49:54.825 --> 49:56.486
- Are you not sleeping?

49:56.526 --> 49:57.618
- I can't sleep.

49:57.661 --> 49:59.128
Can you not sleep?

50:00.564 --> 50:02.395
Here.

50:02.432 --> 50:04.366
Thanks.

50:04.401 --> 50:06.460
- Yeah.

50:13.810 --> 50:15.141
- What do you think of her?

50:18.415 --> 50:20.178
- I think she's great.

50:20.217 --> 50:21.514
You know, I really like her,

50:21.551 --> 50:26.454
and she seems great.

50:28.925 --> 50:31.052
Do you not like her?

50:31.094 --> 50:34.552
- No, I just said I like her.

50:34.598 --> 50:35.860
I do.

50:35.899 --> 50:38.094
- Did you... what did you guys
do last night?

50:39.536 --> 50:41.868
- We, um...

50:44.141 --> 50:45.267
Nothing.

50:45.308 --> 50:47.276
You know, it was just,
like, small talk,

50:47.310 --> 50:49.175
getting to know
each other a little bit.

50:49.212 --> 50:53.205
And it was nice.

50:55.552 --> 50:57.281
- Do you think
that she's pretty?

50:59.623 --> 51:03.992
- I think she is
empirically attractive.

51:05.896 --> 51:07.921
- What?

51:07.964 --> 51:11.525
- "Technically speaking she is,
uh, pretty attractive."

51:11.568 --> 51:13.468
- Whatever.

51:13.503 --> 51:14.936
She's a pretty girl.
Yeah.

51:14.971 --> 51:16.302
- She's really pretty.

51:16.339 --> 51:17.931
- She's a pretty girl.

51:17.974 --> 51:18.998
- This is her room.

51:19.042 --> 51:20.009
Do you know that?

51:20.043 --> 51:21.010
- This is her room?

51:21.044 --> 51:22.238
- You're in her room.

51:22.279 --> 51:24.008
- That's weird.
Why'd she put me in here?

51:25.582 --> 51:26.776
She hates this room.

51:29.019 --> 51:30.816
- Maybe that's why
she put me in here.

51:30.854 --> 51:32.947
- She does.
She really hates this room.

51:32.989 --> 51:36.356
She hasn't even unpacked.

51:36.393 --> 51:37.451
- Wow.

51:37.494 --> 51:39.121
- Yeah, that's all her stuff.

51:39.162 --> 51:40.288
Shit.

51:42.766 --> 51:43.790
- What is that?

51:43.834 --> 51:45.131
- This is all her paintings.

51:45.168 --> 51:47.136
I don't know if she even knows
they're here.

51:47.170 --> 51:51.903
She hasn't picked up a brush
in years, but...

51:51.942 --> 51:53.500
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

51:53.543 --> 51:55.033
These are all
from around here.

51:55.078 --> 51:58.275
And this is a nudist beach

51:58.315 --> 51:59.577
on the other side
of the island.

51:59.616 --> 52:00.674
- On this island?

52:00.717 --> 52:01.684
- Yep.

52:01.718 --> 52:04.050
- That's crazy.

52:04.087 --> 52:05.884
- Anyway...

52:05.922 --> 52:08.550
- Anyway.

52:17.634 --> 52:20.262
I got to tell you something.

52:20.303 --> 52:21.827
- What?

52:28.411 --> 52:30.072
- I...

52:35.085 --> 52:36.609
- What?

52:39.923 --> 52:44.587
- I am too old to ride bicycles
to islands.

52:47.430 --> 52:48.556
- Anyway,

52:48.598 --> 52:52.125
that's my big confession
for the night.

53:26.937 --> 53:28.268
You just put your foot
in my face,

53:28.305 --> 53:29.397
you son of a bitch.

53:29.439 --> 53:30.428
- What?

53:30.473 --> 53:31.770
- You just put your foot
in my face.

53:31.808 --> 53:32.866
- No, I didn't.

53:32.909 --> 53:34.137
- You did.

53:37.147 --> 53:38.239
- Shit head.

54:09.279 --> 54:10.405
- Hey.

54:10.447 --> 54:12.312
- Hey.

54:16.820 --> 54:18.481
- You were right.

54:20.023 --> 54:21.854
- About what?

54:21.891 --> 54:26.157
- It's just, um,
better if she doesn't know.

54:26.196 --> 54:27.561
Cool?

54:27.597 --> 54:29.997
- Yeah, that's...
that's good for me, yeah.

54:40.076 --> 54:43.068
- Just like that.

54:43.113 --> 54:45.547
- Ew, it's a gloopy.

54:45.582 --> 54:46.640
- I prefer "eye booger."

54:46.683 --> 54:47.707
- Oh...

54:47.751 --> 54:49.184
- What are... what are we
in for here?

54:49.219 --> 54:50.413
- Hmm?
- What are we in for here?

54:50.453 --> 54:51.681
- I have no idea.

54:51.721 --> 54:54.189
- Are you guys ready for
the best gluten-free, vegan,

54:54.224 --> 54:56.522
soy-free pancakes
you're ever gonna eat?

54:56.559 --> 54:57.924
- Mmm.

54:57.961 --> 54:58.985
- Absolutely.

54:59.029 --> 55:00.860
- Seriously,
these are delicious.

55:00.897 --> 55:01.886
- They look really good.

55:01.931 --> 55:03.296
- You can have a little
sad pancake.

55:03.333 --> 55:04.300
- There's the little man.

55:04.334 --> 55:05.631
- Look, two little
sad pancakes.

55:05.669 --> 55:07.728
- Oh, he is a little sad.
I'll make him happy.

55:07.771 --> 55:09.932
- Tell me if you miss
anything,

55:09.973 --> 55:11.634
'cause I would be very surprised
if you do.

55:11.675 --> 55:12.699
- Okay.

55:12.742 --> 55:13.902
- Um... oh!

55:13.943 --> 55:15.205
Maple syrup.

55:15.245 --> 55:18.237
- Maple syrup.

55:22.052 --> 55:24.885
- Oh, shoot.

55:24.921 --> 55:27.651
Okay, you know what?

55:27.691 --> 55:30.387
No maple syrup, but we do have
cashew butter.

55:30.427 --> 55:31.394
- Mmm.

55:31.428 --> 55:32.417
Amazing.

55:32.462 --> 55:33.588
- They're good?
- Mm!

55:33.630 --> 55:35.097
- Oh, my God.
I'm so excited.

55:35.131 --> 55:36.359
- That's great.
- So good.

55:36.399 --> 55:38.026
- They're actually even good
without it.

55:38.068 --> 55:40.593
But I will try it with.

55:40.637 --> 55:41.626
See how we do.

55:41.671 --> 55:42.968
- I put that stuff on
everything.

55:43.006 --> 55:43.973
It is delish.

55:44.007 --> 55:45.065
- Yeah?

55:47.644 --> 55:50.112
Mmm.
Good.

55:50.146 --> 55:51.238
- They're good?

55:51.281 --> 55:53.249
- Very good.
- Very good.

55:53.283 --> 55:54.875
- I'm so happy
you guys like them.

55:54.918 --> 55:56.078
I mean, do you miss it?

55:56.119 --> 55:57.677
Do you even miss the butter
and the milk?

55:57.721 --> 56:00.087
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

56:06.863 --> 56:07.989
- They're terrible.

56:08.031 --> 56:09.965
No, they're not.

56:09.999 --> 56:11.466
- They're so bad.

56:11.501 --> 56:13.696
- They're so good, right?

56:13.737 --> 56:14.863
Aren't they good?

56:14.904 --> 56:16.462
- I think "terrible"
is an extreme word.

56:16.506 --> 56:18.531
I think that
they are challenged,

56:18.575 --> 56:19.701
but they are...

56:19.743 --> 56:21.074
- I think it's
a very good effort.

56:21.111 --> 56:22.135
- It's not.

56:22.178 --> 56:23.304
You know what it is?

56:23.346 --> 56:25.041
The flax seeds
didn't do a good job.

56:25.081 --> 56:27.072
I put flax seeds in
to replace the egg,

56:27.117 --> 56:29.210
and usually I use coconut oil,
but we didn't have any.

56:29.252 --> 56:30.480
And it's just...

56:30.520 --> 56:32.317
- Well, you didn't have
the right ingredients.

56:32.355 --> 56:33.322
- We didn't.

56:33.356 --> 56:34.618
- This is what I think.

56:34.657 --> 56:35.783
We'll have a second round.

56:35.825 --> 56:36.849
- Okay.

56:36.893 --> 56:38.326
- You get all
the right ingredients.

56:38.361 --> 56:40.454
I'll make my pancakes,
you make yours,

56:40.497 --> 56:41.964
and we'll have, like,
a pancake-off.

56:41.998 --> 56:45.161
And then whoever wins will win,
like, a...

56:45.201 --> 56:47.294
- Trip to, uh, IHOP.

56:47.337 --> 56:48.326
- A trip to IHOP.

56:48.371 --> 56:49.861
But make sure you bring
your passport,

56:49.906 --> 56:51.430
'cause it's international,
you know.

56:51.474 --> 56:52.498
- Right.

56:55.011 --> 56:56.808
Well done.

56:56.846 --> 56:58.108
Sorry, you guys.

56:58.148 --> 56:59.410
- Don't be sorry.

57:00.784 --> 57:02.615
- Do you know what
I'm so excited about?

57:02.652 --> 57:04.586
- What?
- You.

57:04.621 --> 57:05.815
- What do you mean?

57:05.855 --> 57:07.186
- I'm happy you've left her.

57:07.223 --> 57:08.850
I think that's what
I'm trying to say.

57:08.892 --> 57:10.223
- I think I'm happy too.

57:10.260 --> 57:12.125
- I've kind of missed seeing
your face like this.

57:12.162 --> 57:14.221
It's the first time I've seen
you look really happy

57:14.264 --> 57:16.255
in a long time.

57:16.299 --> 57:18.130
That's awesome.

57:18.168 --> 57:19.396
Despite the terrible pancakes.

57:20.603 --> 57:22.696
- You do.
It's really lovely for me.

57:22.739 --> 57:27.039
I've missed you, you know,
seeing you.

57:27.076 --> 57:29.169
Fuck Pam.
- Fuck her.

57:29.212 --> 57:31.339
- Fuck Pam.

57:31.381 --> 57:32.643
- Fuck Pam.

57:32.682 --> 57:34.513
- Fuck Pam.
- Fuck Pam.

57:34.551 --> 57:36.382
Or don't fuck Pam.

57:36.419 --> 57:38.046
Fuck someone else now.

57:40.857 --> 57:42.518
You can do anything
you want now.

57:42.559 --> 57:43.617
That's the thing.

57:43.660 --> 57:44.820
It's really exciting.

57:44.861 --> 57:46.351
You can go traveling now.

57:46.396 --> 57:47.454
You're not stuck in...

57:47.497 --> 57:48.794
- I can.
I was thinking about that.

57:48.832 --> 57:49.856
- You can go to India.

57:49.899 --> 57:51.594
You can find yourself,
like Lenora.

57:51.634 --> 57:53.602
You can do whatever you want.

57:53.636 --> 57:54.762
You can have a baby now.

57:54.804 --> 57:56.271
A baby?

57:56.306 --> 57:58.399
- She's always wanted them.
She's always wanted them.

57:58.441 --> 57:59.772
- That's right where
my mind goes.

57:59.809 --> 58:01.674
Let me go have a baby now.

58:01.711 --> 58:04.236
- No, I've been thinking
about it, that she's...

58:04.280 --> 58:05.611
she's always wanted one
as well.

58:05.648 --> 58:07.411
She has actually always wanted
a baby.

58:07.450 --> 58:09.111
You should try.

58:09.152 --> 58:10.141
Now is your time.

58:10.186 --> 58:11.585
I mean, were you trying?

58:11.621 --> 58:13.987
Were you even trying?

58:14.023 --> 58:15.217
- Yeah, I mean, we had...

58:15.258 --> 58:16.885
you know, we'd been
talking about it.

58:16.926 --> 58:18.621
- She never wanted them,
though.

58:18.661 --> 58:19.628
- But she said she did.

58:19.662 --> 58:21.129
- Yeah, she said was gonna...

58:21.164 --> 58:23.564
she said she was gonna relent
at some point.

58:23.600 --> 58:25.465
And I don't think she ever
wanted them.

58:25.502 --> 58:28.630
And you have such
an opportunity now, you know?

58:28.671 --> 58:30.229
- Yeah.

58:30.273 --> 58:32.036
- Okay.
Are you embarrassed a bit?

58:32.075 --> 58:34.066
It's probably embarrassing,
in front of Jack.

58:34.110 --> 58:35.634
- No. No.
It's just... yeah.

58:35.678 --> 58:36.736
I mean...

58:36.779 --> 58:38.508
We just...
it wasn't on the table.

58:38.548 --> 58:39.947
At the end of the day,
it wasn't...

58:39.983 --> 58:43.783
uh, wasn't to be,
so moving on.

58:43.820 --> 58:44.980
- All right,
I'm just saying

58:45.021 --> 58:46.511
that there's
tons of stuff you can do.

58:46.556 --> 58:47.989
- Travel.

58:48.024 --> 58:50.083
- No, but you... there's...
don't change the subject.

58:50.126 --> 58:51.957
This is what you want.

58:51.995 --> 58:53.587
There's sperm donors.

58:53.630 --> 58:54.597
There's like...

58:54.631 --> 58:55.723
- Christ.
- Yeah.

58:55.765 --> 58:57.096
- It's expensive.

58:57.133 --> 58:59.567
- But what I'm saying now
is that there's, like...

58:59.602 --> 59:00.728
you can go online.

59:00.770 --> 59:02.032
There's sperm donors.

59:02.071 --> 59:03.504
There's sperm in the air.

59:03.540 --> 59:06.475
You just grab a dude
and preg yourself up.

59:08.478 --> 59:09.672
- That sounds horrible.

59:10.747 --> 59:12.180
- Pick a guy.
Any guy.

59:12.215 --> 59:14.843
It would just be one night,
and then you're done.

59:16.953 --> 59:18.250
- I'm gonna get some coffee.

59:18.288 --> 59:19.585
Would you like a refill?
- Mm-hmm.

59:19.622 --> 59:21.021
- Hannah, would you like
something?

59:21.057 --> 59:22.547
- Ah, yes.
Thank you.

59:22.592 --> 59:23.684
Refresh, please.

59:23.726 --> 59:24.852
- Coffee?
Okay.

59:24.894 --> 59:25.861
Good.

59:25.895 --> 59:27.055
I'll be right back.

59:31.167 --> 59:32.930
I need to talk to you.

59:40.810 --> 59:43.370
- Let's go for a walk.
- Okay. Good.

59:43.413 --> 59:45.711
Um, we're going to go
for a walk, Jack-Jack.

59:45.748 --> 59:48.615
You're gonna stay here
and think about your life.

59:48.651 --> 59:51.085
Come on, Hannah.

59:51.120 --> 59:52.087
- I'm going for a walk.

59:52.121 --> 59:53.315
- Hey, hey.

59:53.356 --> 59:55.449
Hey, hey, quick.

59:55.491 --> 59:59.359
Um, just wanted to check in
with you real quick.

59:59.395 --> 01:00:02.831
So I don't know exactly
how to put this,

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:06.494
but it definitely was
a little weird.

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.060
I didn't know about you

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:11.505
and your relationship to,
like, wanting a baby and stuff,

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:13.031
which is great, obviously.

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:14.668
But, in terms of, like,
the whole, like,

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:17.680
"Oh, just grab a guy,
and there's sperm everywhere,"

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.909
Like, it definitely made me
think for a sec.

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:21.849
Our first night...

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:24.682
I hate to even bring it up,
but I feel like I should just...

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:26.245
- We used a condom.

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:29.981
- That's true.

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.015
Yeah, you're right.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.153
Sorry.

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:34.220
Sorry.
Are we good?

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:35.628
Okay, thanks.
Sorry about that.

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:36.689
I didn't mean to...

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:37.757
- See you later.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.767
- Backtrack.

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:41.269
I just felt like
double-checking.

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.568
Safety first.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:47.936
- Yeah, and the thought of it
is scary,

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.376
and it's all
of those things.

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:51.209
And if I'm gonna do it,

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:53.112
I just feel like
I should just tell him.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:56.448
And I thought about it
all night.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:01:00.217
And we slept in the same
fucking bed, you know.

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:03.248
And it's just the comfort
and the ease that we have.

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:07.194
I just don't believe
that just evaporates.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.458
I hope, anyway.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.830
I just feel like I've got
to take this leap.

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:14.598
And I was lying there
last night,

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.969
and I couldn't
get to sleep.

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.473
And he's snoring next to me,

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:19.805
and I'm, like,
"Just tell him.

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:20.968
Just fucking tell him."

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:23.604
You know, I just...

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.614
I just have to.
I think it's time.

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:28.048
And I don't even know
what he's gonna think

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:29.073
or what he's gonna say.

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:32.178
I just feel like
I've got to stop

01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:35.349
feeling so passive about things,
you know?

01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:36.517
What's the matter?

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:39.551
Why are you being so quiet?

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:34.482
- You don't think
I should do it?

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:36.747
- No, I have
to tell you something.

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:42.281
And I have to tell you something
before I tell you something.

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:43.849
The first thing
that I'm gonna tell you,

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:45.417
you're going to have
a big problem with.

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:47.588
So I think I'm just
gonna tell you.

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:48.824
- Okay.

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:04.813
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:05.871
Oh, my God.
Oh.

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:23.059
- Iris!

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:28.732
- Jack!

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:30.068
- Whoa, whoa.

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:31.767
What's going on?
What's going on?

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:33.366
- You fucked my sister.

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.444
You fucked my sister!

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.878
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.313
- Look, I'm so sorry.

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:41.475
- You were here for one night.
She's a fucking lesbian.

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:42.506
- It was a total mistake.

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:44.019
You should never
have known about it.

01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:45.486
I'm so sorry,
but there's something

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:46.886
much bigger at work here...
Hannah!

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:48.788
- Iris, I'm so sorry.
- Tell her about the condom.

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.190
Hannah, tell her
about the condom.

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:52.091
- What's he talking about?
- Tell her.

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:53.186
I found the condom!

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:54.856
- What'd you do?

01:03:54.897 --> 01:03:56.330
Why were you looking
for the condom?

01:03:56.365 --> 01:03:57.423
What's going on?

01:03:57.466 --> 01:03:58.660
- Well, well, why?
You know why?

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.396
Because she poked holes
in the condom.

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:01.835
- Can you just shut up
for one second?

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.236
- No, you poked holes
in the condom.

01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:04.466
It's a fucking rain shower!

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:05.599
She tried to steal my sperm.

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:07.006
- I didn't try to steal
your sperm.

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:08.135
- Well, then, what was that?

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:10.611
- Did you poke holes
in a condom, Hannah?

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:11.943
- No.
Yes.

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:12.970
- Why?

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:15.040
- No, I was trying...

01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:16.346
I was trying to get pregnant.

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:18.080
- With Jack?
- Yeah.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.246
- No.
Not with Jack.

01:04:19.288 --> 01:04:20.846
With someone.
- Oh, my God.

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:23.017
- Jack, you didn't even...
you weren't even gonna know.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:24.219
- Oh, I wasn't going to know?

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.784
- It was going
into a little plastic sack

01:04:25.828 --> 01:04:27.022
and get thrown
into the trash.

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:28.030
- Exactly!

01:04:28.064 --> 01:04:29.190
Where sperm belongs

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:31.029
so it doesn't become
a fucking baby

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:32.329
that I don't know about!

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:34.302
- Okay, so this...
let me just clear this up.

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:40.799
You potentially could be
pregnant with his baby.

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.640
Is that what...
is that what you're telling me?

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:43.702
- I don't know.

01:04:43.746 --> 01:04:45.373
- Holy shit.
Holy shit.

01:04:45.414 --> 01:04:46.847
You had to pick him,
didn't you?

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:48.578
You had go pick Jack.
- I didn't pick him.

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:49.880
- All the guys.

01:04:49.919 --> 01:04:51.910
All of the guys,
and you had to go and pick him.

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:53.751
- I wasn't trying to pick him.
I was just...

01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:55.256
- Why?
Why did it have to be him?

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:57.191
- I didn't know you were
in love with him!

01:04:58.427 --> 01:05:01.157
How could I know you were
in love with him?

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:06.901
I would never have done that.

01:05:06.936 --> 01:05:08.528
I don't want to hurt you.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:10.402
I didn't know.

01:05:12.174 --> 01:05:13.471
What are you doing?

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:14.999
- I don't know.

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:18.013
I just wanted a baby.

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:20.571
I'm sorry.

01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:22.015
Fuck.

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:23.450
I fucked up.

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:25.010
- Fuck.

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:44.896
I am a really bad person.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:29.982
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:32.010
- No.

01:06:32.054 --> 01:06:34.545
I don't want to talk to you,
Jack.

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:40.893
- Hey, hey.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.994
- I really think your face
is going to annoy me right now.

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:47.502
I don't want to talk to you.

01:06:47.536 --> 01:06:49.504
- My face always annoys you.

01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:58.309
- I'm so sorry.

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:04.613
- Why did you do that?

01:07:08.991 --> 01:07:14.657
Did you not think that
that would be weird for me?

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.597
Did you not think that, like,

01:07:16.632 --> 01:07:22.036
even if I hadn't found out
that that would be weird thing,

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:26.974
that you'd have to carry that
and still be friends with me?

01:07:27.009 --> 01:07:29.637
- It's weird.

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:31.669
It's definitely weird.

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:39.245
But it's, like, I...

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:42.621
I slept with your sister,

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:48.221
and you slept with my brother.

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:53.391
And I don't know.

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:58.868
I don't even...

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.170
This is just
so confusing.

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:03.303
There's a lot happening
right now.

01:08:03.345 --> 01:08:06.576
But I can't...

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:10.176
I can't come between you
and your sister, okay?

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:12.312
That is not something
I can ever do.

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:16.791
- I can't even think about her
right now.

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:19.783
- She...

01:08:19.828 --> 01:08:23.026
- I don't want anything to do
with her right now, okay?

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.901
- I just know I saw her
when you left the room,

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:34.240
and she loves you,

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:35.470
and she's sorry.

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:43.042
You can never understand
how important

01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:48.455
the bond is that you have
with your sister.

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:51.585
You will never understand
the way I do.

01:08:53.828 --> 01:08:59.323
I could never live with myself
if I knew, in some way,

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:03.770
I might be coming between you
or the cause of any of that.

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:08.134
And what I did was a mistake,

01:09:08.176 --> 01:09:13.809
and it's the worst fucking
mistake I have ever made.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.314
But I didn't...

01:09:24.225 --> 01:09:26.353
Oh, fuck.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.073
I didn't sleep with your sister

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.804
'cause I wanted to sleep
with your sister.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:44.142
I slept with your sister

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.581
because I can't be with you.

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.258
I have to go.

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:03.160
- Where are you going?

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:06.724
- I don't know.

01:10:08.837 --> 01:10:10.566
- You gonna come back?

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:24.663
I made some potatoes
if you want some.

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:14.474
- Iris?

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:16.006
- Yeah?

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:18.876
- I'm sorry.

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:14.502
- Morning.

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:52.832
Have you thought about what
you're gonna do,

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:55.900
you know, if there's a baby?

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:04.485
- Not really.

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:17.897
- 'Cause I was just thinking

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:21.994
that I wouldn't want you to...

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:25.006
feel alone,

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:28.737
you know?

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:32.406
And if you wanted any help

01:17:32.447 --> 01:17:37.180
that that would be
something I could do.

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:47.188
You know that I could help you
raise the baby.

01:17:53.368 --> 01:17:55.802
I have a spare room.

01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:04.076
- Are you sure that's what
you'd be up for,

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:05.636
want to do,

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:08.115
could bite off?

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:11.916
I don't know.

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:14.854
- Yeah, I think it is.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:22.028
I could do the 3:00 a.m. feed,
you know?

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.089
I don't know.

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:28.659
I've just been thinking
about it.

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:31.264
It's whatever you want.

01:18:36.311 --> 01:18:38.040
- I think I'd like that.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.104
- Yeah?

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:40.136
- Yeah.

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:45.384
Thanks,

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:50.289
just, you know,
for the offer, even,

01:18:50.325 --> 01:18:53.055
even if there is no baby.

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:57.488
- It's okay.

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.185
- Warm up?

01:19:22.557 --> 01:19:23.717
- Yeah.

01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:27.953
I'm sorry.

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:29.759
- It's okay.

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:57.653
- Here comes
the milk police car.

01:19:57.692 --> 01:20:00.820
- Here comes
the milk race car.

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:10.269
- Whoever has the Sun,
turn it on!

01:20:26.955 --> 01:20:28.115
- Fuck.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:20:59.978
Fuck!

01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:04.985
Fuck you.

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:39.887
Fuck you.

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:41.361
Fuck you!

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:44.923
Fuck you!

01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:16.296
- I think if you see
two together, it's good luck.

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:17.457
- The crows?

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:21.629
- Yeah, and one
is a spirit guide.

01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:37.545
- Hi.

01:22:38.887 --> 01:22:40.411
- Hi.

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:41.479
Hi.

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:45.356
I have something I want to say
to you guys, okay?

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:51.322
I'm unemployed,

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:53.061
and I'm financially unstable,

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:59.233
and I am emotionally, at best,
precarious,

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:01.435
at worst, a cripple.

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:05.879
And I'm not in a place
in my life

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:10.248
to be any sort
of father figure, potentially.

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:13.618
And I'm certainly,
as your best friend,

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:17.250
no one I would recommend
as a boyfriend.

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:21.891
And that sucks,

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:26.492
because you...

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:29.367
might be carrying my baby,

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:34.740
and I'm in love
with your sister.

01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:41.910
But...

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:50.924
I'm tired of being dead,

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:52.927
and I want
to come back to life.

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:59.628
So if there, you know,
is a baby in there,

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:04.297
you absolutely
should have that.

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:08.867
And I would love to help
if you want me...

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:11.435
not pushy, just available,

01:24:11.479 --> 01:24:15.313
be it friend or uncle
or dad-ish,

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:17.511
on some level.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:22.046
And you.

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:29.061
I don't deserve you.

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:32.760
But I would give you

01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:36.430
every fucking thing
that I have.

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:44.102
And if you guys would consider
having me,
