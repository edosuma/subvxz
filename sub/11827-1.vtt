02:17.923 --> 02:20.389
...this inditement is only one of
a series to be handed down...

02:20.490 --> 02:24.461
as result of the respectful
rangery investigation.

02:24.562 --> 02:28.030
Grave robbing, in Texas, is this
hour top news story...

02:28.131 --> 02:31.399
and informant led officers at
Marto County sheriff department...

02:31.500 --> 02:34.935
to a cemetery, just outside
the small Texas community of Newt...

02:35.036 --> 02:36.538
...early this morning.

02:36.639 --> 02:40.341
Officers there discovered what
appeared to be a grizzly work of art...

02:40.442 --> 02:44.543
the remains of a badly decomposed body,
wired to a large monument.

02:44.644 --> 02:46.979
A second body was found
in the ditch near...

02:47.080 --> 02:50.582
the perimeter of the cemetery,
subsequent investigation has revealed...

02:50.683 --> 02:52.850
at least a dozen empty crypts.

02:52.951 --> 02:56.421
And it's clear more will turn up
as the probe continues.

02:56.521 --> 03:00.622
Deputies report that in some instances,
only parts of the corpses have been removed.

03:00.723 --> 03:02.124
The head, or in some cases...

03:02.225 --> 03:04.231
the extremities removed, and...

03:04.332 --> 03:06.762
the remainder of the corpse left
intact. Evidence indicates...

03:06.863 --> 03:10.209
the robberies have occurred
over a period of time.

03:10.310 --> 03:12.900
Sheriff Jesús Maldonado
refuses to give details...

03:13.001 --> 03:15.171
in this case and said only...

03:15.272 --> 03:17.695
that he did have a strong
evidence linking the crime to...

03:17.796 --> 03:22.075
elements outside the state.
Area residents have reportedly...

03:22.176 --> 03:24.609
converged on the cemetery
claiming the remains of relatives

03:24.710 --> 03:26.135
have been removed.

03:26.446 --> 03:29.693
No suspects are in custody, as
investigation at the scene...

03:29.794 --> 03:31.116
continues.

04:54.391 --> 04:58.029
...mental hospital and released.
A 16-story-building downtown...

04:58.130 --> 05:02.611
Atlanta, collapsed today, killing
at least 29 persons.

05:02.712 --> 05:07.435
The engineering firm responsible
could offer no explanation for...

05:07.536 --> 05:11.081
the collapse although the
construction firm say there's...

05:11.182 --> 05:15.438
no logical reason for the
collapse is suspected sabotage.

05:15.539 --> 05:18.442
Police in Gary, Indiana, have
been unable to identify the...

05:18.543 --> 05:21.839
bodies of a young man...

05:21.940 --> 05:28.647
and four children
who had their features carved away,

05:28.748 --> 05:30.934
the man's dimples had been removed.

05:31.120 --> 05:34.555
Police first identified
the victims as 2 women...

05:34.656 --> 05:39.458
continuing the program of the
government to overwhelm reaches...

05:39.559 --> 05:42.495
beyond the Amazon today are
ruptured into violence...

05:42.596 --> 05:48.057
Forces of at least three South America
governments already have been involved...

05:51.203 --> 05:55.406
...this territory it tells it's
sketchy and yet none of...

05:55.507 --> 05:59.109
the governments is involved
as its knowledge to a war.

05:59.210 --> 06:02.433
...Police in Dallas arrested a
young couple today...

06:02.534 --> 06:04.916
complaints by neighbors led
them to discover a 18-month-old

06:05.017 --> 06:06.552
daughter the couple...

06:06.653 --> 06:11.595
chained in the attic of a
dilapidated house...

06:20.366 --> 06:21.197
Franklin!

06:32.554 --> 06:34.149
Are you ok?

06:38.816 --> 06:44.106
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take...

06:44.207 --> 06:47.857
- much more of this.
- The condition of retro gradation...

06:47.958 --> 06:51.139
is contrary or inharmonious to the
regular direction of actual...

06:51.240 --> 06:54.152
movement in the zodiac, and is,
in that respect, evil.

06:54.253 --> 06:57.667
Hint: When malefic planets are in
retrograde, and Saturn is malefic...

06:57.768 --> 07:01.386
their maleficies are increased.

07:01.487 --> 07:04.265
Have you been doing that Reader's
Digest worth our...

07:04.366 --> 07:06.643
Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad
influence. It's just particularly...

07:06.744 --> 07:10.694
bad influence now, because
it's in retrograde.

07:10.795 --> 07:14.499
Hey, man, do you believe all that
stuff your old lady is talking me?

07:33.163 --> 07:35.740
My granddaddy is buried here. Can
we find out if anything happened?

07:35.841 --> 07:38.053
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- See that big heavy fella...

07:38.154 --> 07:41.836
standing with that big flashlight,
isn't that the sheriff?

07:41.937 --> 07:44.947
You go tell him your granddaddy is
buried in there. He'll let you in.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.498
Ok. Thank you.

07:47.802 --> 07:49.258
Hey, fella, I'm gonna
run off to...

07:49.359 --> 07:51.903
- meet him if you don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.

07:52.113 --> 07:55.481
- Hey, folks. Let us go see where...

07:55.582 --> 07:58.207
her granddaddy's buried.

08:01.723 --> 08:05.781
Things happen here about
they don't tell about.

08:05.927 --> 08:09.156
I see things.

08:11.632 --> 08:17.863
You see, they say it's just an old
man talking.

08:18.840 --> 08:22.176
You laugh at an old man...

08:22.277 --> 08:27.975
this thing that laughs
knows better.

08:33.655 --> 08:37.859
Yes, they're sure. The man said the
Tallman's grave had been dug up.

08:37.960 --> 08:41.363
Mama, don't worry.
I saw it myself!

08:41.464 --> 08:44.054
It didn't look dug up to me.

08:47.102 --> 08:50.797
What's that? What smell?

08:50.906 --> 08:55.637
What is that stench?

09:00.050 --> 09:05.485
Hey. That's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used...

09:06.222 --> 09:10.058
to sell his cattle! We got an uncle
that works in one of those places...

09:10.159 --> 09:13.829
outside of Fortworth. See those
buildings there? That's where...

09:13.930 --> 09:17.400
they kill him. They bash'em in the
head with a big sledgehammer!

09:17.501 --> 09:20.899
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill him.

09:35.584 --> 09:38.321
It'd start squealing and freaking
out, they'd have to...

09:38.422 --> 09:40.589
come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.

09:40.690 --> 09:44.960
They'd scatter them before
they were even dead.

09:45.061 --> 09:48.130
That's horrible! People shouldn't
kill animals for food.

09:48.231 --> 09:52.035
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they get this big air gun...

09:52.136 --> 09:55.398
that shoots a bullet into the skull
and then retracts it.

09:57.208 --> 10:01.011
Franklin, I like me, please
change the subject.

10:01.112 --> 10:03.668
That smell's still going on.

10:06.217 --> 10:09.809
Oh, man! It's hot in here.

10:14.625 --> 10:17.294
- Hitchhiker!
- Should we take him up?

10:17.395 --> 10:19.863
Yeah man, pick him up.
He'll asphyxiate out there!

10:19.964 --> 10:21.597
- What does he look like?
- The son of a bitch 's gonna...

10:21.698 --> 10:24.802
- smell like the slaughterhouse.
- Give the guy a break. He can...

10:24.903 --> 10:26.870
- sit by Franklin.
- What do you wanna do?

10:26.971 --> 10:30.233
- He's weird looking, no.

10:49.696 --> 10:54.653
- I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where're you heading, man?

10:54.799 --> 10:59.236
- You work at that place?
- Don't.

10:59.337 --> 11:01.963
- How did you get stuck out here?

11:02.308 --> 11:05.309
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- I got an uncle that works...

11:05.410 --> 11:07.979
- at a slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.511
My grandfather, too.

11:10.916 --> 11:14.051
My family's always been in beef.

11:14.152 --> 11:16.947
The whole family are cracked.
Hey man, did you go into that...

11:17.156 --> 11:21.325
slaughter room or whatever
they call it?

11:21.426 --> 11:24.163
Where they shoot the cattle
with that air gun thing?

11:24.264 --> 11:27.332
- That gun is no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.

11:27.433 --> 11:31.336
With the sledge!
That was better.

11:31.437 --> 11:34.405
- They died better that way.
- How come? I thought the gun...

11:34.506 --> 11:36.509
- was better.
- Oh no. With the new way...

11:36.610 --> 11:42.147
- people were put out of jobs.

11:42.248 --> 11:44.941
- You do that?
- Look!

11:50.924 --> 11:54.727
- I was the killer!
- Let me see them.

11:54.828 --> 11:58.230
- They don't seem to head your way.
- You took these, huh?

11:58.331 --> 12:00.264
- Yeah!
- Franklin.

12:02.136 --> 12:04.504
- Let me see.
- They make hitches...

12:04.605 --> 12:14.048
They take the head and they boil,
except for the tongue, and scrape...

12:14.149 --> 12:18.173
all the flesh away from the bone.

12:18.619 --> 12:21.054
They use everything,
they throw nothing away.

12:21.155 --> 12:26.392
They use jaws, muscles, and
the eyes, and the ligaments...

12:26.493 --> 12:28.996
- and everything!
- Look at this.

12:29.097 --> 12:33.834
- They boil the nose and the gums
down to a big jelly of fat.

12:33.935 --> 12:36.503
I don't know it was in that stuff.

12:36.604 --> 12:39.539
It's really good. Do you like it?

12:39.640 --> 12:44.811
- Yeah, I like it. It's good!
- It sounds horrible. Can't we...

12:44.912 --> 12:47.514
- talk about something else?
- You'd probably like it if you...

12:47.615 --> 12:49.650
didn't know what was in it.

12:49.751 --> 12:52.376
I wouldn't and I wish you'd
stop talking about it.

12:53.254 --> 12:56.413
Take it before everybody's sick.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.306
What are you doing?

13:16.645 --> 13:19.975
Look. I think that might hurt.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.049
Oh, come on!

13:30.860 --> 13:33.792
What are you doing to yourself?

13:34.063 --> 13:37.826
Oh, what are you doing?

13:45.875 --> 13:46.931
Nice, man!

14:07.798 --> 14:10.663
I have this knife.

14:12.503 --> 14:13.866
Put that away, too.

14:15.439 --> 14:20.897
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man. Put it back.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.185
You took my picture!

15:05.157 --> 15:10.627
You can take me to my house.
I live right off this road.

15:10.728 --> 15:14.753
I don't know, man.
We're in much of a hurry.

15:15.633 --> 15:18.403
- How close is it?
- It's real close.

15:18.504 --> 15:23.507
Couldn't you just walk? I mean...
If it's so close.

15:23.608 --> 15:27.345
You could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese. My brother...

15:27.446 --> 15:30.148
- makes it real good. You'll like it.
- I think we'd better push on, man.

15:30.249 --> 15:36.115
Don't we, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry...

15:57.877 --> 16:03.015
- It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.

16:03.116 --> 16:05.083
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?

16:05.184 --> 16:07.852
- 2 dollars. It's a good picture.
- No, man. Franklin...

16:07.953 --> 16:11.613
give him back that picture.

17:44.219 --> 17:46.886
I'm about to freak. Call a cop.

17:46.987 --> 17:50.250
That's the last damn hitchhiker
I ever take.

17:56.564 --> 17:59.553
- Listen to Franklin's horoscope:
- I'm sorry.

18:02.004 --> 18:04.172
Travel in the countryside.

18:04.273 --> 18:08.009
Long range plans,
upsetting persons...

18:08.110 --> 18:12.180
around you, could make this a
disturbing and unpredictable day.

18:12.281 --> 18:16.618
The events in the world are not
doing much, to cheer one up.

18:16.719 --> 18:19.220
- That's just perfect!
- Franklin, I think you'll be alright.

18:19.321 --> 18:23.914
Hey, Kat, read Alex's. He's
Capricorn.

18:32.134 --> 18:33.064
Oh, no.

18:33.503 --> 18:38.574
Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.
There are moments where we...

18:38.675 --> 18:41.310
cannot believe that what's
happening is really true...

18:41.411 --> 18:45.401
pinch yourself and you may
find out that it is.

19:16.681 --> 19:17.907
Hurry up.

19:26.758 --> 19:27.950
Here comes somebody.

19:34.599 --> 19:35.723
How are you?

19:38.269 --> 19:40.427
Would you fill her up, please?

19:41.439 --> 19:42.995
I got no gas.

19:44.142 --> 19:47.444
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty. Transport won't...

19:47.545 --> 19:50.681
be here until this afternoon.

19:50.782 --> 19:53.584
Maybe not even until
tomorrow morning.

19:53.685 --> 19:57.743
Hey, you know where "The Old
Franklin Place" is?

20:02.394 --> 20:05.763
- "The Old Franklin Place"?
- It's an old 2-story house and...

20:05.864 --> 20:09.032
it's sitting up on the hill. I think
you have to turn on the road...

20:09.133 --> 20:11.928
back there,
but I'm not real sure.

20:12.205 --> 20:16.502
Maybe I've seen something like
that up there. But look, you boys...

20:17.309 --> 20:22.480
don't wanna go messing around
an old house.

20:22.581 --> 20:25.718
Those things are dangerous,
you're bound to get hurt!

20:25.819 --> 20:28.453
- We'll be careful.
- Don't wanna go fooling around...

20:28.554 --> 20:32.591
other folk's property. Some folks
don't like it.

20:32.692 --> 20:34.525
They don't mind
showing you.

20:34.626 --> 20:37.663
- My father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?

20:37.764 --> 20:39.457
- Yeah.
- Look...

20:40.066 --> 20:44.737
I got barbecue here. Why don't
you stay a while?

20:44.838 --> 20:48.396
The transport will be by
in a little while...

20:50.243 --> 20:53.209
I can go and get some barbecue.

20:54.080 --> 20:57.850
Them girls, they don't wanna go
messing around an old house.

20:57.951 --> 21:00.678
Best you stick around here.

21:11.497 --> 21:14.734
We should've asked him if there's
another gas station around here.

21:14.835 --> 21:17.801
Don't you think he would have told
us if there was?

21:18.138 --> 21:23.129
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I'll go ask.

21:27.181 --> 21:30.511
What the hell, we should have
stopped back there for gas.

21:30.751 --> 21:33.775
Go, damn it.
There.

21:34.221 --> 21:36.447
You think this place has
room service?

21:37.125 --> 21:40.591
Franklin, you're cutting the van!

21:42.296 --> 21:46.161
Yeah, I just started doing that.

21:49.637 --> 21:55.708
I bet this is some of that guy's
blood. Look at that.

21:55.809 --> 21:59.332
- Think it's his blood?
- I guess so.

22:01.116 --> 22:05.709
That's blood, alright. And I got
cut the hell out of him, chef.

22:06.655 --> 22:09.587
You think you could do that
to yourself?

22:09.858 --> 22:11.950
Crazy?

22:13.862 --> 22:18.796
It takes something, though, I mean,
do that to yourself, like he did.

22:21.836 --> 22:24.962
You think I said something that
made him mad?

22:27.375 --> 22:30.898
- What?
- Franklin, you're crazy as he was.

22:33.515 --> 22:38.314
Hey, I got us some barbecue.
Newt's the closest place to get gas.

22:44.593 --> 22:48.731
We're going to that Granpa's place.
There's a creek, you can go swimming.

22:48.832 --> 22:52.367
Come on, Sally, we're going to
that Granpa's place!

22:52.468 --> 22:56.071
- Let's go.
- Hey, that guy smeared blood...

22:56.172 --> 23:01.476
- all over the van.
- Let's not waste time to wipe this up.

23:01.577 --> 23:05.271
What? What did you do?
You're in someone's van?

23:26.203 --> 23:28.600
Let me see your knife.

23:32.309 --> 23:33.433
Thank you.

23:39.816 --> 23:42.518
Franklin, if we run out of gas
before we get back to that service...

23:42.619 --> 23:45.847
station, you're towing us back
in that chair.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.792
Hey...

23:57.501 --> 23:59.870
You think that guy was just trying
to scare us by blowing out...

23:59.971 --> 24:02.834
my picture like that?

24:48.987 --> 24:52.044
Oh, look, they let the place
fall apart.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.418
Put it over there.

24:57.162 --> 25:00.151
- Wanna go over there?
- Let's go.

25:05.370 --> 25:06.858
Oh, Kirk, come on!

25:07.307 --> 25:09.829
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

25:13.213 --> 25:16.771
I want to see the smear
the guy made.

25:23.622 --> 25:27.259
This is weird.
I wonder if that means something.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.661
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's gonna get you.

25:29.762 --> 25:33.957
- Why don't you wash it off, ok?
- I want to see inside.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.061
- Jerry!
- Ok!

25:38.338 --> 25:40.928
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

25:42.308 --> 25:45.744
- Get it. You wash it up.
- You don't think that guy...

25:45.845 --> 25:49.278
- is trying to follow us, do you?
- What for?

26:01.061 --> 26:04.789
Where's my knife?
Kirk?

26:06.267 --> 26:08.601
Looks like it must have been
a nursery room.

26:08.702 --> 26:12.473
This was my room. I got to stay
here until I was 8 years old.

26:12.574 --> 26:15.341
- Until my grandmother died.
- What happened?

26:15.442 --> 26:19.637
- To my grandmother?
- Yeah, she died.

26:52.981 --> 26:56.450
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- I think it's seen better days...

26:56.551 --> 26:59.320
These animals would to put me to
sleep when I was a little girl.

26:59.421 --> 27:03.412
Look at the zebra. I had this
fascination for the zebras...

27:03.826 --> 27:04.916
Kate?

27:32.321 --> 27:33.343
Sally!

28:42.327 --> 28:45.691
Come on, Franklin!
It's gonna be a fun trip.

28:53.771 --> 28:58.603
If I have any more fun today,
I don't think I'll take it!

29:17.496 --> 29:20.962
- Hey, Franklin!
- What's wrong?

29:21.633 --> 29:24.895
Didn't you say there was a
swimming well out here?

29:26.605 --> 29:29.764
Pam and I would like to go
swimming in there.

29:32.211 --> 29:35.871
There used to be a trail down
between those two old sheds.

29:36.616 --> 29:37.774
Come on.

29:40.820 --> 29:45.844
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- We'll see them in an hour or so.

29:47.325 --> 29:51.815
Yeah. See them down in
about an hour or so.

30:11.078 --> 30:15.376
Sally!
Sally...

30:33.262 --> 30:35.954
Seed growing in the world...

30:36.565 --> 30:39.553
I don't want to miss it.

30:42.003 --> 30:45.332
Man, a scorpion,
there's a scorpion!

30:56.981 --> 30:58.104
Crap!

31:02.453 --> 31:03.747
This must be it!

31:04.720 --> 31:06.014
Are you ok?

31:08.123 --> 31:10.991
What the hell, Franklin would never
get down here anyway.

31:11.092 --> 31:14.060
I bet he must have when
he was little.

31:14.161 --> 31:17.319
Franklin never was little.

31:25.939 --> 31:27.699
Gasoline.

31:28.639 --> 31:32.007
I can leave my guitar, you know,
I'd give him a couple of bucks...

31:32.108 --> 31:35.378
We gotta come back by here anyway,
I can pick up my guitar and...

31:35.479 --> 31:37.613
give him a couple more dollars
and we get more gas...

31:37.714 --> 31:40.649
He won't want your guitar,
he's not gonna sell us some gas...

31:40.750 --> 31:43.112
let's just go back now.

32:24.819 --> 32:28.910
Hey, come here!
Come here, look at this.

32:54.709 --> 32:56.604
- A generator!
- What?

32:57.011 --> 33:00.476
A generator! For electricity!

33:02.515 --> 33:06.003
Hey, hello! Is there anybody
in the house?

33:50.154 --> 33:52.709
Hello! Is anybody home?

34:13.607 --> 34:16.400
I got something for you.

34:22.813 --> 34:23.937
Let's go!

34:28.485 --> 34:29.505
Hello?

34:31.487 --> 34:32.918
Hello?

34:43.163 --> 34:46.560
- Come look at this!
- Let's go!

34:49.369 --> 34:50.355
Hello!

34:54.672 --> 34:55.762
Anybody home?

34:57.908 --> 34:58.769
Hello?

35:10.251 --> 35:11.579
Hey, Pam!

35:19.458 --> 35:20.581
Hello!

35:44.379 --> 35:45.434
Kirk!

35:59.692 --> 36:00.987
Kirk!

36:09.800 --> 36:10.627
Kirk!

36:20.241 --> 36:21.136
Kirk?

36:45.662 --> 36:46.523
Kirk!

36:50.700 --> 36:51.391
Kirk?

37:00.775 --> 37:01.500
Kirk?

40:28.575 --> 40:30.910
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you!

40:31.011 --> 40:32.944
You don't think it means anything?

40:33.045 --> 40:35.580
We'll protect you if
he tries to get you.

40:35.681 --> 40:39.409
- Maybe it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.

40:41.252 --> 40:45.446
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- You worry too much.

40:46.455 --> 40:50.393
He couldn't find us, anyway.
He doesn't even know our names.

40:50.494 --> 40:53.228
I gave him your name, Franklin.
And I told him where you lived.

40:53.329 --> 40:56.130
I even gave him your ZIP code.
He's gonna kill you.

40:56.231 --> 40:57.195
Jerry...

40:58.232 --> 41:01.734
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.

41:01.835 --> 41:04.904
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife, remember?

41:05.005 --> 41:07.401
When did you have it last?

41:08.541 --> 41:12.376
I didn't have it last.
You had it last.

41:12.477 --> 41:14.778
I gave it to you, remember?
What did you do with it?

41:14.879 --> 41:17.080
I don't know. Didn't I
give it back to you?

41:17.181 --> 41:20.349
No, I didn't have it when I got
out of the van.

41:20.450 --> 41:24.177
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right. I'll look for it.

41:25.288 --> 41:28.122
Listen, I think I'll walk down to
the creek before it gets too dark.

41:28.223 --> 41:29.923
How do I get there, Frank?

41:30.024 --> 41:33.649
Well, there's a trail down there.
Between the two old sheds.

41:34.261 --> 41:37.784
- Can I go too?
- I think you'd better stay here.

41:38.699 --> 41:40.061
All right.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.166
I can't find it.

41:57.714 --> 42:02.944
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

42:05.854 --> 42:08.819
You really are mad, huh?

42:09.590 --> 42:12.113
I don't blame you.

42:13.327 --> 42:14.689
Kirk!

42:25.571 --> 42:29.038
You really didn't want me
to come, did you?

42:29.139 --> 42:35.004
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.

42:38.447 --> 42:43.050
Did you believe all that stuff
Pam was telling about?

42:43.151 --> 42:46.318
Saturn, and retrograde,
and all that?

42:46.419 --> 42:51.183
I don't know. Everything means
something, I guess.

42:56.161 --> 42:59.328
You don't think that guy is
trying to follow us, do you?

42:59.429 --> 43:02.520
I mean, there's no way
that he could follow us.

43:06.236 --> 43:09.201
He'd probably find
Kirk and kill him.

43:15.743 --> 43:19.300
- Sally...
- What now?

43:22.482 --> 43:23.913
Nothing.

43:26.753 --> 43:28.650
Never mind.

43:34.024 --> 43:35.249
Kirk!

44:05.616 --> 44:07.171
Hello?

44:10.987 --> 44:12.509
Is anybody home?

44:17.159 --> 44:21.455
Excuse me, I'm looking for
some friends. Hello?

44:26.434 --> 44:28.194
Is anybody here?

44:31.704 --> 44:32.668
Damn.

44:49.953 --> 44:54.442
Kirk!
Are you guys in there?

44:58.226 --> 45:02.216
Hey, guys! Quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.

45:10.336 --> 45:12.325
Pam, is that you?

45:16.142 --> 45:17.834
Okay, you guys!

45:21.811 --> 45:25.869
Come on out.
Come on!

45:36.190 --> 45:37.882
Kirk?

47:36.921 --> 47:40.990
They must be lost. They don't
have a flashlight or anything.

47:41.091 --> 47:44.459
If they 're not back in a minute,
we'd better go look for them

47:44.560 --> 47:47.582
What if we get lost, too?

47:48.330 --> 47:51.832
Sally, we ought to go to that
gas station and get help.

47:51.933 --> 47:54.989
I'm not leaving here
without Jerry.

47:55.969 --> 47:57.661
Jerry!

47:59.338 --> 48:03.796
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

48:05.711 --> 48:09.075
Jerry!

48:10.214 --> 48:11.235
Jerry!

48:12.950 --> 48:13.879
Hey!

48:18.821 --> 48:22.013
They'll probably be back
in a minute or so.

48:23.291 --> 48:26.951
Sally, we ought to go
to that gas station.

48:29.163 --> 48:30.525
Sally...

48:32.299 --> 48:34.888
I think we ought to go.

48:37.936 --> 48:40.867
Are the keys in the van?

48:42.373 --> 48:44.941
Could I see the flashlight
for a minute?

48:45.042 --> 48:46.506
What for?

48:47.077 --> 48:49.745
Let me see the flashlight.
I'm gonna go look for them.

48:49.846 --> 48:51.147
You don't have to go.

48:51.248 --> 48:53.448
Sally, no, I don't think that's
a good idea, Sally.

48:53.549 --> 48:56.013
I don't think you ought to go.

48:56.284 --> 48:58.852
Look, I'm gonna honk
the horn one more time.

48:58.953 --> 49:03.424
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No, I'm gonna honk the horn...

49:03.525 --> 49:07.926
and we will wait a minute, and
they will come and we will go.

49:08.027 --> 49:09.048
All right?

49:15.400 --> 49:19.469
Sally, they took the keys!
We don't have any keys!

49:19.570 --> 49:20.625
They took the keys!

49:22.239 --> 49:24.330
Stop it!
Stop it!

49:26.409 --> 49:31.346
- Now give me the flashlight!
- No, Sally! You can't go!

49:31.447 --> 49:33.847
What if they came back
and we weren't here?

49:33.948 --> 49:37.317
- Franklin, give me that flashlight!
- I'll keep the flashlight!

49:37.418 --> 49:40.486
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right! All right!

49:40.587 --> 49:42.921
I'll go with you. I'll go
with you, all right?

49:43.022 --> 49:46.523
I'll go with you, but I'll
keep the flashlight.

49:46.624 --> 49:49.527
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.

49:49.628 --> 49:52.329
I can't push you down the hill!

49:52.430 --> 49:53.519
Sally...

49:56.199 --> 50:00.758
- Look, I'll go with you...
- Never mind, I'll go without it.

50:01.938 --> 50:06.871
All right. Sally, wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.

50:07.275 --> 50:10.576
Sally! Hold on a minute now.

50:10.677 --> 50:12.336
All right, let's go.

50:12.813 --> 50:15.505
Let's go, I'll go with you.

50:16.316 --> 50:18.651
Sally, I can't keep up with you!

50:18.752 --> 50:19.841
Sally!

50:20.686 --> 50:23.378
Sally, wait a minute!

50:29.393 --> 50:30.322
Hold on!

50:39.235 --> 50:43.168
Jerry!

50:43.537 --> 50:44.432
Jerry!

50:52.379 --> 50:57.540
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

50:58.549 --> 51:01.880
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

51:09.959 --> 51:12.514
I thought I heard something.

51:13.095 --> 51:14.559
There's a light!

51:14.930 --> 51:16.258
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

51:19.400 --> 51:23.423
- It looks like a house.
- Come on, push!

51:32.744 --> 51:37.109
- It's a house!
- I can't see it very well.

51:37.449 --> 51:42.780
- Franklin, this is impossible.
- Come on, Sally!

51:43.419 --> 51:46.179
Get back and push, damn!

51:46.521 --> 51:48.248
Impossible!

51:51.159 --> 51:56.650
I heard something over there!

51:59.766 --> 52:04.028
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!

52:11.677 --> 52:14.869
Sally, I hear something.
Stop! Stop!

54:20.346 --> 54:21.935
Help!

54:30.853 --> 54:33.444
Help me!

54:58.811 --> 55:00.936
Help!

55:09.385 --> 55:14.116
Help me, please!

58:05.527 --> 58:10.296
- Help! Help!
- Whoa! Whoa!

58:10.397 --> 58:15.229
- Help me! Help me!
- Come over here!

58:17.705 --> 58:20.739
You're all right, girl.
Okay?

58:20.840 --> 58:23.465
Hold on, take it easy, all right?

58:23.566 --> 58:26.749
He killed...

58:27.424 --> 58:31.146
- Take it easy...
- He killed Franklin...

58:31.247 --> 58:32.537
Call the police!

58:34.072 --> 58:35.327
Jerry!

58:36.667 --> 58:39.257
I don't know what happened
to the others...

58:39.358 --> 58:41.751
There's nobody out there now!

58:41.852 --> 58:45.332
Take it easy!
Take it easy!

58:45.543 --> 58:46.697
What happened?

58:47.538 --> 58:53.048
- Call the police...
- There's no phone here.

58:53.921 --> 58:59.170
We have to drive to the sheriff's.

58:59.873 --> 59:02.365
Take it easy. Take it easy.

59:02.466 --> 59:04.050
I'll get the truck.

59:04.527 --> 59:09.640
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Don't go! Don't go!

59:17.028 --> 59:19.720
The weather is expected to
continue warm and clear...

59:19.821 --> 59:20.807
and partially cloudy tomorrow...

59:20.908 --> 59:27.177
with no chance of precipitation.
Expected high of 90 °F.

59:27.278 --> 59:31.342
Our current temperature is 96°.
Winds blow southeast at 3 ml/h.

59:31.443 --> 59:35.049
Community 98, kilometer 29.9.

59:35.150 --> 59:37.540
Acting on a typical day
with some news...

59:37.641 --> 59:40.176
the word is that the sheriff's
office began an investigation...

59:40.277 --> 59:42.606
early this morning in the
County Cemetery.

59:42.707 --> 59:46.195
Opening crypts and muslins
where there was evidence of...

59:46.296 --> 59:49.611
tampering, The Sheriff found
a reported dozen coffins were...

59:49.712 --> 59:52.337
robbed a part of its contents.
According to the sheriff, Rhesus...

59:52.438 --> 59:55.095
Maldonado, there are ones
from which only the head and...

59:55.196 --> 59:57.854
extremities are removed,
and others

59:57.955 --> 01:00:00.173
and others from which only a
hand or foot removed, with the...

01:00:00.274 --> 01:00:07.416
remainder of the cadaver left
intact. Maldonado linked...

01:00:34.402 --> 01:00:36.335
What are you doing?

01:00:36.772 --> 01:00:39.533
- You will come with me...
- No!

01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:49.909
- What do you want?
- There's no need to do that...

01:00:50.057 --> 01:00:52.784
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:02.074
I had to lock up and
get the lights off.

01:03:02.175 --> 01:03:05.972
Because electricity is enough to
drive a man out of business.

01:03:35.454 --> 01:03:40.048
I hope you're not too
uncomfortable down there.

01:03:43.264 --> 01:03:47.269
You got nothing to worry about.
Just take it easy.

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:51.065
We're gonna get there soon.

01:03:52.811 --> 01:03:55.540
No, no, no.

01:03:56.716 --> 01:03:59.876
There's no need to do that.

01:04:27.126 --> 01:04:31.230
We always do our best.

01:04:31.331 --> 01:04:32.489
Hang on.

01:04:36.204 --> 01:04:37.191
No.

01:04:41.946 --> 01:04:43.913
Half witch.

01:04:48.989 --> 01:04:50.614
You little shit!

01:04:58.668 --> 01:05:02.006
You knock-head idiot!

01:05:02.107 --> 01:05:05.544
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.

01:05:05.645 --> 01:05:08.874
You damn fool!
You almost got caught.

01:05:09.216 --> 01:05:12.454
No! They didn't see me.
They don't know nothing!

01:05:12.555 --> 01:05:16.318
I told you to stay away
from that graveyard.

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.367
I told you...

01:05:57.016 --> 01:06:02.324
I told you never to leave
your brother alone!

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:07.019
Get that girl out of the car!
Get her out!

01:06:11.202 --> 01:06:15.000
I hope your brother didn't let any
of those kids get away.

01:06:22.117 --> 01:06:26.450
Look at what your brother did
to that door!

01:06:35.803 --> 01:06:38.965
You let her go!

01:06:40.343 --> 01:06:42.572
You goddamn idiot!

01:07:06.078 --> 01:07:09.671
I thought you were in a hurry.

01:07:13.222 --> 01:07:16.246
Where are the kids?
Where are the children?

01:07:20.365 --> 01:07:21.887
Did they get away?

01:07:23.703 --> 01:07:25.362
Are you sure?

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:31.776
You...

01:07:33.248 --> 01:07:37.513
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!

01:07:46.601 --> 01:07:50.306
Hey, come here! Look!
See how nice she looks!

01:07:50.407 --> 01:07:53.806
Get upstairs and get
your grandpa!

01:08:10.568 --> 01:08:14.173
Take it easy there, huh?

01:08:14.274 --> 01:08:18.106
You'll stay here for
a few minutes.

01:08:19.915 --> 01:08:22.144
Get back in there!

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.715
To the chamber!

01:08:33.165 --> 01:08:36.028
You just take it easy.

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:41.470
We'll have something
to eat right away.

01:09:09.316 --> 01:09:11.145
Hey, you two!

01:09:11.687 --> 01:09:14.482
Give me a hand
with grandpa!

01:10:09.465 --> 01:10:11.021
Look, grandpa! Look!

01:12:25.589 --> 01:12:26.918
Knock it off!

01:12:27.624 --> 01:12:32.497
Quiet! You act like a pack
of hounds.

01:12:32.598 --> 01:12:37.470
- We're just having fun!
- You think this is a party?

01:12:37.571 --> 01:12:43.245
Please!
You can make them stop!

01:12:43.346 --> 01:12:47.974
- No shit?
- Shut your mouth!

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.624
Can't be helped, young lady.

01:12:51.725 --> 01:12:56.319
Please! You can't let them
kill me!

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.669
He likes this face.

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:24.236
He's crazy!
You gotta make him stop!

01:13:24.337 --> 01:13:25.666
Please...

01:13:26.373 --> 01:13:32.207
- He's just a cook!
- Shut up, you bitch hog!

01:13:33.314 --> 01:13:36.253
He always does all the work.

01:13:36.354 --> 01:13:39.189
He don't like it. Is that right?
You're just a cook!

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:40.721
Shut your mouth!

01:13:42.795 --> 01:13:45.565
You don't understand nothing.

01:13:45.666 --> 01:13:49.938
I understand you ain't nothing!
We do all the work!

01:13:50.039 --> 01:13:53.563
I just can take no
pleasure in killing.

01:13:57.114 --> 01:14:01.420
It's just something we gotta do.
It don't mean you have to like it.

01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:02.508
Please...

01:14:03.124 --> 01:14:04.350
Please...

01:14:10.366 --> 01:14:15.029
I'll do anything you want.

01:15:17.993 --> 01:15:20.630
You don't need to torture the girl.

01:15:20.731 --> 01:15:23.200
Please, shut up. Remember
you're just a cook.

01:15:23.301 --> 01:15:25.562
Let me and him handle this.

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.503
I won't have this.

01:15:31.413 --> 01:15:36.440
We ain't in no hurry.
And you ain't going no place.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.979
You don't hear me?
I heard you told me much.

01:15:43.662 --> 01:15:48.324
No sense in waiting.
I gotta go to my room.

01:15:49.338 --> 01:15:53.075
I'll take her to grandpa.

01:15:53.176 --> 01:15:55.011
Grandpa'll have some fun.

01:15:55.112 --> 01:15:56.846
You always said he was the best.

01:15:56.947 --> 01:15:59.451
He's the best all right.

01:15:59.552 --> 01:16:03.824
Let's let him half leg.
Grandpa, we're gonna let you...

01:16:03.925 --> 01:16:05.288
have this one!

01:16:14.672 --> 01:16:16.228
Have this one!

01:16:20.146 --> 01:16:25.311
He won't use you much.
He won't hurt none.

01:16:25.588 --> 01:16:29.692
Our grandpa was the best killer
there ever was.

01:16:29.793 --> 01:16:33.197
I never took all the guts to see.

01:16:33.298 --> 01:16:37.165
I did in 6 in 5 minutes once.

01:16:37.405 --> 01:16:41.008
I could've done more if the hook
pulled again could've gotten the...

01:16:41.109 --> 01:16:43.438
beaves out of the way faster.

01:16:44.013 --> 01:16:50.533
Now don't you cry. Grandpa is
the best. It won't hurt a bit.

01:16:53.644 --> 01:16:54.572
No!

01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:02.095
No!

01:17:08.807 --> 01:17:12.737
Please! Don't!

01:17:28.003 --> 01:17:29.091
Hit her!

01:17:44.933 --> 01:17:46.328
Hit the bitch!

01:17:47.499 --> 01:17:49.225
Go ahead!

01:18:21.491 --> 01:18:24.683
Give me the hammer!

01:18:28.623 --> 01:18:31.314
Give me the hammer!
I'll kill her!

01:21:17.287 --> 01:21:22.147
Go! Go!
