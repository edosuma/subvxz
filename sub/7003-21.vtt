WEBVTT

00:07.673 --> 00:10.374
Oh, you guys
are doing so great.

00:10.375 --> 00:13.011
This is gonna raise
a lot of money for the library.

00:13.012 --> 00:16.615
I hate to break this to you,
mom, but you forgot to put
the date on the invitations.

00:16.616 --> 00:19.951
It's not
supposed to have a date.
It's a "no dinner" dinner.

00:19.952 --> 00:21.319
What's that?

00:21.320 --> 00:24.322
It's a dinner party
with no dinner and no party.

00:24.323 --> 00:28.860
Sounds great, mom. Put me down
for five "no tickets."

00:28.861 --> 00:30.862
I know it sounds
a little confusing,

00:30.863 --> 00:33.665
But this way,
the library doesn't have to
buy food or rent a hall.

00:33.666 --> 00:36.101
They get to keep
all the money they raise.

00:36.102 --> 00:39.270
Then why do you send
an invitation? Why don't
you just ask for money?

00:39.271 --> 00:41.806
'cause it's fun. You know,
people get into it.

00:41.807 --> 00:46.711
Cool. Tonight,
I think I'll throw myself
a "no homework" homework party.

00:46.712 --> 00:49.514
Yeah, right.

00:49.515 --> 00:51.249
Morning, everybody.
Morning.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.918
Big day today.
We're doing a huge <i>tool time.</i>

00:53.919 --> 00:55.286
What's it about,
dad?

00:55.287 --> 00:57.856
We're building
a man's kitchen.

00:57.857 --> 01:02.560
What's that, a kitchen where you
stand over the sink to eat?

01:02.561 --> 01:04.394
No, a man's kitchen.

01:04.396 --> 01:07.298
You can cook a cow,
braise a buffalo,
grill a grizzly.

01:07.299 --> 01:09.567
<i>(grunts)</i>

01:09.568 --> 01:10.935
You can eat grizzly?

01:10.936 --> 01:12.704
Yeah, sure.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.039
Tastes like chicken.

01:16.809 --> 01:20.078
And with the leftovers,
you can make a peanut butter
and grizzly sandwich.

01:21.714 --> 01:23.882
<i>(grizzly-like roar)</i>

02:33.719 --> 02:36.054
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

02:40.726 --> 02:42.193
The binford 6100

02:42.194 --> 02:45.130
Is available at
fine hardware stores
everywhere.

02:45.131 --> 02:47.132
Remember, if your drill
says "binford,"

02:47.133 --> 02:48.366
Get outta the house!

02:48.367 --> 02:50.668
Tools aren't supposed
to talk to you!

02:59.278 --> 03:01.312
Now the moment
we've all been waiting for -

03:01.313 --> 03:04.082
The introduction of
the man's kitchen.
A guy's galley.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.651
I am man, hear me roast.

03:06.652 --> 03:08.486
<i>(grunts)</i>

03:08.487 --> 03:10.989
Well, tim, what do you say
we start her up?
That's right.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.224
The only kitchen I know
that has an ignition system.

03:15.360 --> 03:17.896
<i>(motor turns over)</i>

03:20.532 --> 03:22.333
Come on, come on.

03:22.334 --> 03:24.869
Maybe we should get
jumper cables, hook it up
to another kitchen.

03:29.541 --> 03:32.210
I think I got it.
<i>(motor starts)</i>

03:32.211 --> 03:34.545
Listen to that baby purr.

03:34.546 --> 03:38.316
Let's step inside, take a tour
of the man's kitchen.

03:45.524 --> 03:50.461
<i>(grunts)</i>

03:50.462 --> 03:54.165
Well, we start first here
at men's fine china.

03:54.166 --> 03:56.868
That's right.

03:56.869 --> 03:59.670
16-ply steel-belted
paper plates.

03:59.671 --> 04:01.672
These plates
are available

04:01.673 --> 04:05.143
In standard black
and white walls.

04:05.144 --> 04:08.346
Now we move on
to the most important part
of the meal - vegetables.

04:12.751 --> 04:15.619
For most men, there's only
two kinds of vegetables -

04:15.620 --> 04:18.957
Your beans and your potatoes.

04:18.958 --> 04:22.193
I had my beans yesterday.
I know.

04:25.030 --> 04:27.198
Now, potatoes...
Mmm, hard to cook,

04:27.199 --> 04:29.734
'cause when a guy wants to eat,
a guy wants to eat.

04:29.735 --> 04:31.736
He can't wait
for endless seconds
on a microwave.

04:31.737 --> 04:34.205
That's why we've got
the binford macrowave.

04:37.843 --> 04:39.610
Three convenient
power settings -

04:39.611 --> 04:43.248
"high,""really high"
and "split your own atoms."

04:45.384 --> 04:48.552
Now, tim, won't this put out
a little too much radiation?

04:48.553 --> 04:50.788
Mm, that's a good
safety tip, al.

04:50.789 --> 04:53.024
That's why we're
equipped with these.

04:56.762 --> 04:58.363
Lead vests.

05:00.599 --> 05:05.803
Also useful in case
superman wants to take a peek
at your underwear.

05:05.804 --> 05:09.207
No problem there.
I'm not wearing any.

05:18.450 --> 05:21.386
Don't wanna overcook
a potato, so only in there
a couple of seconds.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.721
Now don't look directly
at the potato.

05:30.162 --> 05:31.762
<i>(ding)</i>

05:42.308 --> 05:46.077
Once they stop glowing,
they're probably ready to eat.

05:46.078 --> 05:47.778
Grab the potatoes.
All right.

05:51.650 --> 05:53.484
Hot potato! Hot potato!

05:56.688 --> 05:59.090
Here we have
our beverage center.

05:59.091 --> 06:02.493
We got beer, got root beer,
pepto-bismol.

06:05.064 --> 06:07.131
But now we get to
that main course.

06:07.132 --> 06:10.068
Ooh, yeah. The main course
in every man's meal is what?

06:10.069 --> 06:11.402
That would be meat.

06:11.403 --> 06:12.437
The redder...

06:12.438 --> 06:14.472
<i>(both)</i> the better.

06:14.473 --> 06:17.308
The man's refrigerator -
stainless-steel doors,
big cubic inches.

06:17.309 --> 06:20.278
What does every man dream about
having in a refrigerator?

06:20.279 --> 06:22.880
That's simple, tim.
A butcher.

06:26.852 --> 06:28.519
Benny, how are you doing?

06:28.520 --> 06:31.822
Hey, tim. Hi, al.
What will it be today?

06:31.823 --> 06:35.526
I don't know. I got a hankering
for a thick porterhouse.

06:35.527 --> 06:36.995
Good choice.

06:40.832 --> 06:44.068
I'll take the petite
filet mignon.

06:44.069 --> 06:45.669
Takes all kinds.

06:47.739 --> 06:51.175
Here you go.
Good-looking meat.
Thanks a lot. Stay cool.

06:53.245 --> 06:55.179
All right, we flip them
on our grill.

06:58.283 --> 07:01.052
Now,
you don't wanna overcook 'em.
You just want 'em flame-kissed.

07:09.895 --> 07:13.264
Ding! They're done.
All right.

07:13.265 --> 07:17.101
<i>(moos)</i>
still moving, al.

07:21.806 --> 07:24.409
Now we're ready to
put on our seasoning.

07:24.410 --> 07:27.878
Right. We got hot sauce,
steak sauce, barbecue sauce.

07:27.879 --> 07:29.680
What's your pick?

07:29.681 --> 07:31.715
Not one of those. I'd like
just a pinch of salt.

07:31.716 --> 07:33.584
You got it, friend.

07:39.658 --> 07:41.859
<i>(coughing</i>

07:41.860 --> 07:44.495
Well, I seem to have messed up
your dinner. Let's get rid
of those plates.

07:48.133 --> 07:50.568
Right down
to the recycling center.

07:50.569 --> 07:53.938
Now, we've cleaned the dishes.
What about all the mess
in the kitchen?

07:53.939 --> 07:56.740
The grease, the appliances,
the floor, the walls?
What do we do now?

07:56.741 --> 07:59.243
Tim, the best thing about
the binford men's kitchen

07:59.244 --> 08:02.380
Is it's entirely
self-cleaning.

08:02.381 --> 08:03.814
It is. That's right.

08:03.815 --> 08:07.017
We got the binford
kitchen-washing system here.

08:07.018 --> 08:10.321
You step out of the kitchen,
shut your waterproof doors...

08:10.322 --> 08:15.159
<i>(â™ª fanfare)</i>

08:15.160 --> 08:18.829
Klaus, can we cut the...?
What is this,
a renaissance fair?

08:21.100 --> 08:23.767
You add your detergent pellets
early in the week,

08:23.768 --> 08:27.238
Then you put it on heavy wash,
spin dry, energy saver.

08:27.239 --> 08:28.606
Start your wash.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.611
In a half-hour,
you got a clean kitchen.

08:33.611 --> 08:36.447
Floors, walls,
the whole thing's...

08:50.129 --> 08:53.097
Yeah, that's a fine charity.
I'm sure that they
have a lovely dinner,

08:53.098 --> 08:57.868
But our dinner's
a little different.
There is no dinner.

08:57.869 --> 09:00.037
No, this is not
a crank call.

09:00.038 --> 09:02.673
Uh, we're having
a "no dinner" dinner.

09:02.674 --> 09:04.675
It means you don't
have to get dressed up

09:04.676 --> 09:06.710
And sit in a big
impersonal ballroom

09:06.711 --> 09:10.481
And make small talk
with people you don't know.

09:10.482 --> 09:12.150
You like that.

09:12.151 --> 09:16.754
Well, um, maybe you could just
send a contribution anyway.

09:16.755 --> 09:21.091
You know, 'cause the library
really needs... Hello?

09:21.092 --> 09:24.529
I can't believe
she hung up on me.
Hi.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.697
Hi.
What's the matter?

09:26.698 --> 09:30.701
This "no dinner" dinner thing
is not as easy as I thought.
Nobody understands it.

09:30.702 --> 09:33.538
I can't think about it
right now. My mind's racing.

09:33.539 --> 09:36.641
The man's kitchen went over
bigger than I ever expected.

09:36.642 --> 09:38.976
You know what
the end of next week is?
No, what?

09:38.977 --> 09:41.179
It's the fifth anniversary
of <i>tool time.</i>

09:41.180 --> 09:43.181
I can't believe
you don't remember this.

09:43.182 --> 09:46.517
Tim, when is
our anniversary?

09:52.324 --> 09:54.458
February.

09:54.459 --> 09:56.093
February what?

09:57.429 --> 09:58.596
Middle.

09:59.764 --> 10:02.567
You are so pathetic.

10:02.568 --> 10:06.671
Listen to me. This anniversary
show is huge. It's gotta be
bigger than a kitchen show.

10:06.672 --> 10:09.173
I gotta think of something
that will knock
the audience's socks off.

10:09.174 --> 10:12.876
Why don't you show highlights
from some of your best shows?

10:12.877 --> 10:16.947
As good as those would be,
you can't just show clips
for an anniversary show.

10:16.948 --> 10:18.982
You've gotta think big.
Help me.

10:18.983 --> 10:21.285
Ok, how about this?
All right.

10:21.286 --> 10:23.787
You take the whole crew
to arizona.
I'm with you.

10:23.788 --> 10:25.856
Drive to the grand canyon.
Yeah.

10:25.857 --> 10:29.793
Fill the whole thing in
with putty.

10:33.765 --> 10:37.235
That's ridiculous.
Putty.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.075
Al. Al!

10:45.076 --> 10:48.045
I've got a great idea
for our <i>tool time</i>
anniversary show.

10:48.046 --> 10:50.080
I've been thinking
about that, too.

10:50.081 --> 10:53.984
It should be
something simple, tasteful
and totally tool-oriented.

10:53.985 --> 10:58.522
How about taking the whole crew
down to indy speedway?

10:58.523 --> 11:00.658
I like it.
Yeah!

11:00.659 --> 11:03.827
There's more. I'll challenge
michael and mario andretti
to race with myself.

11:03.828 --> 11:05.563
Great! What about me?

11:05.564 --> 11:07.965
You can serve sandwiches
and wash the cars and stuff.

11:09.635 --> 11:11.835
President davidson.
Hi, guys.

11:11.836 --> 11:13.103
Nice to see you.

11:13.104 --> 11:16.173
Nice to see you, al.

11:16.174 --> 11:18.876
Tim, tim, tim.

11:18.877 --> 11:21.579
What, what, what?

11:21.580 --> 11:23.947
I'm sitting in
binford headquarters
the other day,

11:23.948 --> 11:27.685
I turn on the show
that we sponsor,
and what do I see?

11:27.686 --> 11:30.788
The glare of your head
reflecting off the screen?

11:30.789 --> 11:34.358
No, tim. I see a kitchen

11:34.359 --> 11:36.894
That has sucked up your budget
for the next six months,

11:36.895 --> 11:42.800
Although I do appreciate
your using my brother-in-law
as the butcher.

11:42.801 --> 11:45.603
These figures are off.
Did you see the ratings?
They went through the roof.

11:45.604 --> 11:48.272
It doesn't justify
what you spent.
We talked about this.

11:48.273 --> 11:50.408
You promised you were gonna
start cutting back.

11:50.409 --> 11:53.010
I did cut back.
You know those...
Those lead vests?

11:53.011 --> 11:55.979
Al's was only lead-plated.

11:59.984 --> 12:02.320
Excuse me. I have to
see a doctor now.

12:02.321 --> 12:05.022
It was a joke.
A joke, a joke, a joke.

12:05.023 --> 12:06.757
Well, I'm not joking,
tim.

12:06.758 --> 12:09.226
From now on,
you don't spend a cent
unless I ok it.

12:09.227 --> 12:11.061
All right. We'll start
after the anniversary show.

12:11.062 --> 12:13.197
Wait. What have you
got planned for that?

12:13.198 --> 12:14.665
Well, we're going
to indianapolis.

12:14.666 --> 12:16.767
Aah...

12:16.768 --> 12:17.935
Really?

12:19.904 --> 12:23.040
Well, two words
come to mind. Uh-uh.

12:24.743 --> 12:28.679
No, no.
Look, let me just-just try
to explain this to you again.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.148
This is a "no dinner" dinner.

12:32.784 --> 12:38.188
It doesn't matter what you wear.
There is no place to wear it to.

12:38.189 --> 12:42.059
No, no, there's no point
in ordering a vegetarian plate.
There's no food. No food.

12:42.060 --> 12:45.028
Look, just send me
a check, ok? Goodbye.

12:51.636 --> 12:54.972
Jill. Jill. Guess what happened
when davidson saw...

12:54.973 --> 12:57.140
You will not believe
what I'm going through
with this fund-raiser.

12:57.141 --> 12:59.744
You think it's hard
to sell tickets to a dinner?

12:59.745 --> 13:02.346
Try selling tickets
to a "no dinner" dinner.

13:02.347 --> 13:06.584
He cut the budget on the show.
I am sick and tired of
asking people for money.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.419
It is so degrading.

13:08.420 --> 13:12.556
Talk about degrading. He...
People treat me
like a bill collector!

13:12.557 --> 13:15.726
You know, they
have their numbers changed
just to avoid talking to me.

13:15.727 --> 13:18.128
They see me at the supermarket,
there's this mad rush
for the door.

13:18.129 --> 13:20.898
I wanted to have
the andrettis on...

13:20.899 --> 13:22.933
You have no idea
what it's like

13:22.934 --> 13:25.335
To be the cause
of a multi-shopping cart
collision.

13:25.336 --> 13:27.471
Unfortunately,
I do know how that feels.

13:27.472 --> 13:29.507
I did this out of
the goodness of my heart.

13:29.508 --> 13:34.378
If I could just...
I am so tired
of giving, giving, giving.

13:34.379 --> 13:36.380
When this is all over,
I don't want anybody

13:36.381 --> 13:38.416
To ask anything of me
ever again.

13:38.417 --> 13:41.952
Oh, I'm so sorry.
What were you saying?
How was your day?

13:47.859 --> 13:50.928
Oh, my, my, my,
I know it must be spring

13:50.929 --> 13:54.899
When I hear the sweet sounds
of a wire bristle
on a rusty grill.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.901
That's it, wilson.
What have you got there?

13:56.902 --> 14:00.070
Tim, I'm about to add
some bacterial organisms
to my milk.

14:00.071 --> 14:01.705
Really?

14:03.775 --> 14:06.243
I'm more of a chocolate syrup
kind of guy.

14:06.244 --> 14:07.411
<i>(chuckles)</i>

14:07.412 --> 14:10.213
No, no, no, no, tim.
I'm making yogurt.

14:10.214 --> 14:12.783
The bacteria sours the milk.

14:12.784 --> 14:16.554
You must have put some of that
in my boss' milk.
He's sour all the time.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.188
<i>Tool time</i> troubles, tim?

14:18.189 --> 14:20.290
Our fifth anniversary show
is coming up.

14:20.291 --> 14:22.793
I wanna make a big deal,
but davidson won't pay for it.

14:22.794 --> 14:25.195
I want to make
a big, spectacular gift
to my audience.

14:25.196 --> 14:28.131
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

14:28.132 --> 14:31.234
You know, tim, in ancient china,
there was once an emperor,

14:31.235 --> 14:33.471
And every year
on his birthday,

14:33.472 --> 14:36.306
Everybody in the land
would bring him a gift.

14:36.307 --> 14:39.844
And every year, the gifts
became more and more elaborate.

14:39.845 --> 14:41.779
I get your point.

14:41.780 --> 14:45.182
That's very good,
'cause I haven't
made one yet.

14:45.183 --> 14:47.952
One year, a small boy
appeared before the emperor

14:47.953 --> 14:50.754
And told him that
he had no riches to give.

14:50.755 --> 14:53.891
The only gift that he had
was a song.

14:53.892 --> 14:56.360
You know what
the emperor did?

14:56.361 --> 14:59.997
Got him booked
on <i>dick woo's chinese bandstand.</i>

15:01.967 --> 15:03.968
You're not
making this easy, tim.

15:03.969 --> 15:06.570
Anyway, when the emperor
heard this song,

15:06.571 --> 15:09.907
He was so moved
that he proclaimed it
the greatest gift of all,

15:09.908 --> 15:13.978
Because it was a gift
that came from the heart.

15:13.979 --> 15:15.913
Well, I must get back
to the yogurt.

15:15.914 --> 15:19.817
Does everybody know
what time it is?
<i>(all)</i> tool time!

15:19.818 --> 15:22.786
That's right.
Here he is celebrating
his fifth fabulous year -

15:22.787 --> 15:25.856
Tim "the tool man" taylor!

15:29.227 --> 15:33.463
Thank you. Thank you, heidi.
Thank you, everybody.

15:33.464 --> 15:37.067
Thanks very much.
That's kind of you. I am
tim "the tool man" taylor,

15:37.068 --> 15:40.337
And you know my assistant -
al "stand by your tool man"
borland.

15:40.338 --> 15:44.508
It's great to be here
on this auspicious occasion.
Happy anniversary, tim.

15:44.509 --> 15:47.578
You, too, and happy anniversary
to the audience out there.

15:47.579 --> 15:50.380
If you look under your seats,
there's a personalized gift
from "the tool man."

15:51.683 --> 15:54.418
Made you look.

15:54.419 --> 15:57.354
We've had a lot of fun
these last five years.

15:57.355 --> 16:01.258
A lot of it's to do with
my family. They're here today.
Let's meet 'em, can we?

16:01.259 --> 16:05.529
My lovely, beautiful
and very attractive wife jill.

16:05.530 --> 16:08.699
Brad, mark and randy -
my little boys.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.802
Oh, and my neighbor's
here up behind them.
Wilson, say hi.

16:11.803 --> 16:15.372
<i>Festum diem anniversarium tibi,</i>
<i>tim.</i>

16:15.373 --> 16:16.807
What?

16:16.808 --> 16:19.342
That means "happy anniversary
to you" in latin.

16:19.343 --> 16:22.012
The ancient romans...

16:22.013 --> 16:25.049
Not now, wilson, not now.
We've got plenty of show
to do here, buddy.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.051
There's a lot of ways
we could celebrate
our fifth anniversary.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.820
Could've gone to indy
and had some race drivers on.

16:29.821 --> 16:33.090
But al and I decided to do
something more from the heart,

16:33.091 --> 16:36.860
Like the young chinese boy
that smelled his own yogurt.

16:39.397 --> 16:41.799
We started the show
with a very small budget.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.401
It was just two guys
with a passion for tools.

16:44.402 --> 16:47.337
And one guy
who knew how to use them.
Yeah.

16:51.009 --> 16:53.376
So I went to
binford's headquarters,
in the archives,

16:53.377 --> 16:57.481
And got our first episode,
and I put together
a little highlight tape.

16:57.482 --> 17:00.017
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:00.018 --> 17:03.153
The birth of the tool show.

17:09.260 --> 17:12.029
Does everybody know
what time it is?

17:18.703 --> 17:20.237
<i>(all, unenthused)</i> tool time.

17:20.238 --> 17:23.107
That's correct.

17:23.108 --> 17:28.612
Binford tools
is happy to present
your host tom taylor.

17:28.613 --> 17:30.413
<i>(plays theme)</i>

17:36.087 --> 17:38.188
Uh, thank you, mrs. Binford.
It's tim taylor.

17:38.189 --> 17:39.890
All right.

17:39.891 --> 17:42.926
Well, welcome, audience,

17:42.927 --> 17:46.329
To the premiere episode
of <i>tool time.</i>

17:46.330 --> 17:49.066
It's a show that celebrates
men and their tools.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.234
Before we get to
our project today,

17:51.235 --> 17:54.805
I'd like to bring out
an assistant
that we hired for me.

17:54.806 --> 17:58.542
We auditioned contractors
all through the detroit area,
a lot of professional men,

17:58.543 --> 18:02.980
And this is the guy that would
work for the money we offered.

18:04.248 --> 18:06.583
So, let's bring him out.

18:06.584 --> 18:09.419
A contractor, a master plumber
and a pisces - albert borland.

18:09.420 --> 18:10.854
Come on out, albert.

18:19.931 --> 18:21.165
Good to have you here.

18:24.135 --> 18:25.169
Hi.

18:29.407 --> 18:31.842
Ok. It's nice
to have you here.

18:31.843 --> 18:35.179
I'm al borland,
and I'm pleased to
make your acquaintance.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.847
I'm also very honored

18:36.848 --> 18:39.183
To be part of
your tool education.

18:39.184 --> 18:43.187
It's over here, though.
You would look into
this camera. Um...

18:43.188 --> 18:46.156
My wife suggested
I cut the beard for the look,
but I think it fits...

18:46.157 --> 18:49.559
Oh, no, no. I like
a man in a beard.

18:49.560 --> 18:51.061
Whoa, big fella.

18:51.062 --> 18:53.463
Speaking of big fella,

18:53.464 --> 18:57.067
Who's that big guy
you were talking with backstage?

18:57.068 --> 18:59.203
That was my mother.

18:59.204 --> 19:01.205
Ok. Before we get started,

19:01.206 --> 19:04.108
The first thing
we're gonna learn today
is how to drive a stake.

19:13.251 --> 19:16.319
I don't understand.
Aren't we talking about
wooden stakes?

19:16.320 --> 19:18.588
Albert...
Can I call you al?

19:18.589 --> 19:20.891
Ok.

19:20.892 --> 19:24.161
This is supposed to be a joke.
Guy driving a steak.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.433
Ah...

19:33.537 --> 19:35.806
We've leveled our dirt.
We got some form up.

19:35.807 --> 19:38.108
Al, you guide us
the rest of the way.

19:38.109 --> 19:39.643
We've done about everything

19:39.644 --> 19:41.278
Until we pour the concrete,

19:41.279 --> 19:44.047
So all we need to do now
is set the stakes,
close in the form.

19:44.048 --> 19:44.848
Exactly!

19:44.849 --> 19:46.016
We need a sledgehammer for that.

19:46.017 --> 19:47.584
Mrs. Binford...

19:49.788 --> 19:51.822
There you go, tom.

19:51.823 --> 19:54.291
Thank you,
mrs. Been-in-the-sauce.

19:59.164 --> 20:02.032
Al, will you hold the stake
while I drive her in?

20:02.033 --> 20:07.104
I'd be pleased to, tim.
With an expert like tim,
I know I'm in good hands.

20:09.207 --> 20:11.508
I think we've had
about enough of that.

20:13.444 --> 20:16.280
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed
our first episode.

20:16.281 --> 20:18.381
Not so fast.

20:18.382 --> 20:21.051
Jill and I
have a surprise for you.
What?

20:21.052 --> 20:24.621
We knew you were disappointed
when we couldn't do the show
live from indy.

20:24.622 --> 20:28.192
So we brought a little bit
of indy to you.
What'd you do?

20:28.193 --> 20:31.461
Ladies and gentlemen,
michael andretti
and johnny rutherford.

20:32.864 --> 20:34.698
Hey, hey!

20:34.699 --> 20:37.000
Hey.

20:39.770 --> 20:41.771
Great stuff.

20:44.909 --> 20:47.377
Ah...

20:47.378 --> 20:48.378
Put 'er there.

20:51.682 --> 20:54.517
Al, honey, this is...
Oh, boy.

20:54.518 --> 20:56.553
Well, um, our guests.

20:56.554 --> 21:00.157
Michael andretti,
you've come from formula one
to race indy cars.

21:00.158 --> 21:02.192
With the chip ganassi
team, right?

21:02.193 --> 21:07.197
And johnny rutherford -
three-time indy winner.
This is just too great.

21:07.198 --> 21:09.299
Your dad didn't show up -
mario. Where's he?

21:09.300 --> 21:13.603
Dad couldn't come. He's racing
his racecar, but I brought
somebody just as old.

21:17.108 --> 21:20.543
I believe I beat you here
from the airport, kid.

21:20.544 --> 21:24.147
That's 'cause I used
tim's directions.

21:24.148 --> 21:26.783
Guys, guys. We're not
on a dirt track here.

21:26.784 --> 21:30.120
Come on,
let's enjoy ourselves. Who
talked you into doing this?

21:30.121 --> 21:33.656
Well, your wife can be
a pretty persuasive woman.

21:33.657 --> 21:37.627
Yeah. She even talked us
into a "no dinner" dinner.

21:40.031 --> 21:42.900
Hope there's chicken.

21:42.901 --> 21:46.336
We'll talk with the drivers
after this message
from binford.

22:01.252 --> 22:03.086
That's amazing.

22:03.087 --> 22:05.923
I had no idea you could
do that in an indy car.
That's unbelievable.

22:05.924 --> 22:09.793
I gotta thank michael andretti
and johnny rutherford
for being on the show.

22:09.794 --> 22:13.163
How about a round of applause
for the boys here?

22:15.366 --> 22:16.766
Yeah.

22:16.767 --> 22:20.070
Along with our guests,
al and I wanna thank the people

22:20.071 --> 22:22.072
Really responsible
for <i>tool time.</i>

22:22.073 --> 22:26.709
I wanna get everybody out here.
All the grips, the prop people,
costumes, lights, everybody.

22:26.710 --> 22:29.413
Come on, everybody out here.
Everybody!

22:29.414 --> 22:31.915
Everybody here on <i>tool time.</i>

22:31.916 --> 22:33.883
Wait a minute.

22:33.884 --> 22:34.952
Hey, cameramen, too.

22:34.953 --> 22:35.852
You guys gotta get out here.

22:35.853 --> 22:37.887
Come on, everybody. Come on.

22:37.888 --> 22:39.889
Uh-oh. Bad idea.

22:42.093 --> 22:43.726
<i>(tim)</i> come on out, albert.

22:50.335 --> 22:51.935
Golly, gosh, darn it,

22:51.936 --> 22:53.937
We've had some fun,
haven't we, over the years?

22:53.938 --> 22:55.973
And a lot of it's to do
with my family.

22:55.974 --> 22:58.408
I wanna spin over here
and introduce my family here.

22:58.409 --> 23:00.978
My beautiful, talented,
brilliant wife pat.
