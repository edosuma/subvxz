00:13.875 --> 00:15.125
Mattie!

00:16.708 --> 00:17.833
Mattie!

00:19.458 --> 00:20.791
Mattie!

00:24.291 --> 00:25.125
Mommy!

00:27.583 --> 00:28.583
Mattie!

00:30.333 --> 00:31.875
-Oh, my God! Honey!
-Mommy!

00:32.458 --> 00:35.750
What happened? Huh? Where'd you go?

00:35.833 --> 00:37.375
-Mmm.

00:37.458 --> 00:38.708
What did Gina do? Huh?

00:38.791 --> 00:41.291
What do you mean?
She asked to go to the main road

00:41.375 --> 00:42.458
so she could say goodbye.

00:43.041 --> 00:46.750
Goodbye? Tell me exactly what she said.

00:47.500 --> 00:51.291
She said she loves me and she always will.

00:52.666 --> 00:54.791
And she said to tell you the same thing.

00:56.333 --> 00:57.416
She drive away then?

00:59.041 --> 01:00.541
Did a man pick her up in a truck?

01:01.250 --> 01:02.833
It was a taxicab.

01:03.583 --> 01:04.916
She's gone then?

01:05.583 --> 01:06.458
Oh, yes.

01:08.041 --> 01:11.083
Yeah, I guess she had enough,
you know, of the party.

01:11.166 --> 01:14.250
It would seem so. She is at the Riverside?

01:15.166 --> 01:16.000
Yes.

01:16.666 --> 01:18.083
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.041
Happy birthday.

01:24.541 --> 01:26.916
-Charlie, I'm worried she, um--
-I'll handle it.

01:33.000 --> 01:33.875
Let's go.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.916
<i>Gina, are you really gone for good?</i>

02:01.833 --> 02:04.416
<i>You think Charlie will just let you go?</i>

02:30.333 --> 02:32.625
<i>And Jack will just clean up your mess?</i>

02:38.166 --> 02:41.166
<i>No. There's more trouble to come.</i>

02:57.125 --> 02:58.000
Fire.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.000
I wonder what it is.

03:02.625 --> 03:03.583
Brush fire?

03:04.541 --> 03:05.791
Those are scary.

03:06.375 --> 03:07.333
I hope not.

03:10.375 --> 03:13.583
Here's everyone. You ready to go, bug?

03:13.666 --> 03:14.666
Uh-huh.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.041
Let me get my backpack.

03:16.916 --> 03:18.166
What's on the agenda today?

03:18.250 --> 03:21.041
Butterfly farm.
She's loving that right now.

03:21.666 --> 03:22.500
Thank you.

03:23.000 --> 03:23.916
For what?

03:25.083 --> 03:30.333
For always being there. For her. For me.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.208
What brought this on?

03:33.250 --> 03:37.291
I didn't sleep well last night.
You know, the party and Gina.

03:37.875 --> 03:38.916
She gone again?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.208
Yeah, I guess so.

03:40.791 --> 03:42.833
Well, good riddance is all I can say.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.666
-I got it! Mmm-hmm.
-Great. Let's go.

03:49.708 --> 03:51.250
All right. Be a good listener.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.208
I will!

03:53.166 --> 03:54.583
-Love you!
-Love you!

03:55.416 --> 03:56.875
-Hey, boo!

03:57.458 --> 04:00.083
Y'all have fun today, okay?
Take plenty of pictures.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.625
-We will.
-Love you!

04:01.708 --> 04:02.625
Love you.

04:03.958 --> 04:06.250
I'm gonna check that smoke.

04:07.125 --> 04:07.958
Um…

04:08.458 --> 04:09.458
Mind if I come?

04:11.375 --> 04:12.208
Why?

04:12.916 --> 04:14.708
We do these things together, right?

04:17.541 --> 04:18.791
Jack, please.

04:20.208 --> 04:21.333
I want this to work.

04:22.791 --> 04:23.625
I'm trying.

04:26.750 --> 04:27.583
All right.

04:28.875 --> 04:29.708
Okay.

04:43.875 --> 04:45.208
How did you get that?

04:46.875 --> 04:49.583
I bumped my head. It's nothing.

05:52.125 --> 05:53.791
We think it's Dylan James.

05:54.833 --> 05:56.000
What?

05:59.166 --> 06:03.541
Maybe we should find
somewhere to talk more privately.

06:14.250 --> 06:18.291
He wasn't murdered there.
Somebody moved him to that spot.

06:18.916 --> 06:20.041
But why?

06:20.125 --> 06:21.875
Maybe to send a message?

06:21.958 --> 06:23.333
A message for us?

06:23.416 --> 06:25.458
It could be a coincidence,
but you have to admit

06:25.541 --> 06:28.541
this house has been
the center of a lot of attention lately.

06:29.583 --> 06:31.291
You think someone is targeting us?

06:31.916 --> 06:34.000
I don't know what to think, Leni.

06:35.125 --> 06:38.875
This sort of thing
just does not happen in Mount Echo.

06:38.958 --> 06:40.250
Yeah.

06:41.583 --> 06:45.708
Maybe his truck caught fire.
Maybe he was drunk or something.

06:45.791 --> 06:50.666
No. He had a knife wound
across his abdomen. Significant.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.166
The fire didn't kill him.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.458
Somebody took care of that beforehand.

06:54.541 --> 06:55.583
Jesus.

06:59.666 --> 07:03.500
Mind if I ask you how
you got that abrasion on your forehead?

07:03.583 --> 07:05.458
It wasn't there last night at the party.

07:06.625 --> 07:07.500
Oh, come on.

07:10.208 --> 07:12.625
One of the horses in the barn had a spur.

07:12.708 --> 07:15.625
When I tried to take it out, she jumped.
I took a shot to the head.

07:15.708 --> 07:16.916
It happens all the time.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.833
Anybody else with you?

07:19.916 --> 07:20.958
No.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.458
No, it was early,
before anyone was up. Why?

07:24.500 --> 07:29.708
Well, I overheard some heated words
last night about Dylan and your wife.

07:29.791 --> 07:32.708
So… there's motive.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.875
How about you?
Where were you at the end of the evening?

07:40.958 --> 07:43.166
I went looking for you to say goodbye.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.333
You were nowhere to be found.

07:45.416 --> 07:48.416
I went looking for Gina
and I couldn't find her.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.875
And then I tucked Mattie into bed.

07:51.958 --> 07:55.375
You left your own party
without saying good night to your guests?

07:55.458 --> 07:57.375
That's not like you.

07:57.458 --> 07:59.916
If anything,
you're known for your good manners.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.500
I was worried about my sister.

08:01.583 --> 08:02.958
You ever track her down?

08:03.666 --> 08:04.583
No.

08:05.375 --> 08:06.916
She was upset and left.

08:07.708 --> 08:08.958
Haven't heard from her since.

08:09.541 --> 08:11.916
Mmm. Well, given the circumstances,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.291
I think we should find her
as fast as we can.

08:15.833 --> 08:17.666
Because they had a thing

08:18.416 --> 08:20.541
back in the day, if I remember correctly.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.666
Her and Dylan.

08:23.625 --> 08:24.500
That's right.

08:24.583 --> 08:27.250
Well, I'm not saying she's in any danger,

08:28.208 --> 08:30.541
but until I find who did this,

08:30.625 --> 08:35.083
I think everyone who knew him
should be careful. You understand?

08:35.166 --> 08:36.041
Yes, ma'am.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.791
Yeah.

08:38.541 --> 08:40.041
I'll see myself out.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.041
-Holy shit.

08:48.125 --> 08:50.125
Oh, my God. Poor Dylan.

08:50.208 --> 08:51.458
Poor Dylan?

08:53.416 --> 08:55.583
Floss clearly sees us as suspects now.

09:00.666 --> 09:01.666
Just look.

09:05.541 --> 09:06.708
What is she doing?

09:08.458 --> 09:09.625
Collecting evidence.

09:20.916 --> 09:22.333
No, no, no. Jack.

09:22.416 --> 09:25.666
We need to take care of each other
if we're going to survive this.

09:25.750 --> 09:28.708
Look, Floss is going to start digging
and poking around

09:28.791 --> 09:31.458
and doing what she does
until she finds the truth.

09:31.541 --> 09:34.416
I need to know
what's coming, Jack. Please.

09:37.125 --> 09:38.000
All right.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.875
I got into a shoving match last night
with the two owners of the foal.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.250
-Towers and Payne.
-Right.

09:46.083 --> 09:47.000
So it was stolen.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.541
Oh, please, Leni,
you knew what was going on.

09:49.625 --> 09:50.916
No, but you didn't tell me.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.291
But you knew! You…

09:54.916 --> 09:57.333
Look, they'd already
cornered me about the money.

09:57.416 --> 10:00.083
And after you and I fought,
I was pretty worked up.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.916
I agreed to meet them in
a parking lot to settle things.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.125
What?

10:04.208 --> 10:06.833
They threatened you and Mattie
when I didn't have the money.

10:06.916 --> 10:08.250
So I took a swing at Towers.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.291
You got in a fight in a parking lot?

10:10.375 --> 10:13.333
It wasn't much of a fight.
But he landed a shot on me. Okay?

10:13.416 --> 10:16.416
I… I jumped in my truck.
I came home just like I said.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.666
But that's not the end of it, Leni.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.041
They're coming for us.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.916
They want the full value of the foal.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.041
That's 75 grand plus extra
for all the heat this is bringing.

10:29.125 --> 10:31.791
But they're the thieves.
Why don't we just tell Floss?

10:31.875 --> 10:33.083
Tell Floss what?

10:33.791 --> 10:35.416
That we accepted a stolen horse?

10:35.500 --> 10:36.458
No.

10:36.541 --> 10:38.708
And you and your boyfriend
decided to fence it

10:38.791 --> 10:39.916
to pay for your new life?

10:40.000 --> 10:40.875
That's not it!

10:40.958 --> 10:42.791
Then tell me what happened, Leni!

10:42.875 --> 10:45.250
You said we need to tell the whole truth.

10:45.333 --> 10:46.916
Well, I want it all. Right now.

10:47.583 --> 10:48.708
Because he's dead.

10:49.958 --> 10:51.583
Are you accusing me of something?

10:51.666 --> 10:52.916
Are you accusing me?

10:53.791 --> 10:56.458
Leni, none of this would be happening

10:56.541 --> 10:58.916
if you hadn't taken that horse
and tried to run away!

10:59.000 --> 11:01.291
I didn't take any horse, Jack!

11:01.375 --> 11:04.958
That's what I tried stopping.
Why won't you believe me?

11:05.041 --> 11:08.333
Because I've known you my whole life
and I know when you're lying!

11:17.041 --> 11:19.916
So, you're not going to tell me
the plan you had with him?

11:21.375 --> 11:22.333
I can't.

11:24.375 --> 11:26.500
I never had a plan with Dylan.

11:35.750 --> 11:39.333
You know, Leni, as hard as it seems,

11:40.208 --> 11:42.208
the truth's just easier in the long run.

11:45.250 --> 11:46.125
Jack.

11:53.791 --> 11:57.416
Gina, on the outside chance
that you're still checking this diary,

11:57.500 --> 11:59.541
Dylan was murdered.

12:01.083 --> 12:04.541
Floss says that we all need to be careful.

12:04.625 --> 12:08.000
Charlie says you never came back
to the hotel last night and I'm afraid.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.791
So I'm going to the only other place
that I think you might be.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.250
-Oh.
-Georgia.

12:23.333 --> 12:24.791
They won't let me see him.

12:27.958 --> 12:29.041
I'm so sorry.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.333
Is there something I can do?

12:32.875 --> 12:34.375
He was doing so well.

12:35.666 --> 12:36.666
Starting over.

12:39.916 --> 12:41.875
After his parents were killed, I…

12:42.833 --> 12:44.833
I tried to keep him out of trouble.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.708
But I guess I failed.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.000
It wasn't you.

13:05.208 --> 13:06.416
He was a grown man.

13:07.791 --> 13:09.416
He was making his own decisions.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.208
You did the best you could.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.041
That's what the counselors
have said all along.

13:16.291 --> 13:17.875
But one day, dear,

13:19.416 --> 13:23.208
you'll understand the regret that comes

13:23.291 --> 13:27.000
with realizing that your best
just wasn't good enough.

13:30.375 --> 13:34.250
Grandmothers weren't meant
to arrange funerals.

13:35.416 --> 13:36.541
Now were they?

13:37.750 --> 13:38.708
No.

13:43.375 --> 13:44.875
I hate to ask you…

13:48.583 --> 13:50.791
When was the last time you saw Dylan?

13:51.458 --> 13:53.375
I hadn't seen him much.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.666
He hadn't been around lately.

13:57.791 --> 14:00.458
He seemed busy with his horses and such.

14:01.750 --> 14:02.750
Horses.

14:05.125 --> 14:06.833
I didn't know he was interested.

14:06.916 --> 14:08.541
Oh, it was new.

14:09.083 --> 14:09.958
Hmm.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.083
Dad.

14:20.166 --> 14:23.458
<i>Leni, come home quickly.</i>
<i>Something's happened.</i>

14:37.000 --> 14:38.500
Hey, what is happening?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.708
What are you doing? Jack!

14:40.791 --> 14:43.500
Leni, let's not make this
any harder than it has to be.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.083
Why are you taking him?

14:45.166 --> 14:48.458
Dylan James was murdered
at his grandmother's cottage.

14:48.541 --> 14:51.583
Tire tracks at the scene
match the work truck.

14:51.666 --> 14:55.625
And we also found some vials of ketamine
that came from Jack's office.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.625
What?
Jack couldn't have done this!

14:57.708 --> 14:58.666
You and I both know!

14:58.750 --> 14:59.875
What do we know, Leni?

14:59.958 --> 15:01.625
I've been doing some digging of my own.

15:01.708 --> 15:04.166
I know Dylan James
has been involved with horses.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.250
-Maybe--
-Leni, stop!

15:06.291 --> 15:08.708
I appreciate
your sudden interest in police work,

15:08.791 --> 15:10.791
but I'm gonna stick
with the actual evidence

15:10.875 --> 15:12.208
as opposed to vague theory.

15:12.291 --> 15:14.583
And I'm going to want to talk to you
and your sister.

15:14.666 --> 15:15.958
So I'll be in touch.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.000
Jack.

15:29.291 --> 15:30.375
We'll need a lawyer.

15:31.583 --> 15:34.000
A good one. Someone from DC.

15:34.083 --> 15:36.833
Okay. But this looks bad.

15:36.916 --> 15:39.416
No. He didn't do it, Dad. You know that.

15:39.500 --> 15:42.041
Do I? I don't know what to think anymore.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.041
-What're you hinting at?
-Leni.

15:45.208 --> 15:46.958
You were the one with the ketamine.

15:47.041 --> 15:50.250
I saw you. In the office, remember?

15:50.333 --> 15:51.958
You have access to all the trucks.

15:53.125 --> 15:56.916
You think I'm capable
of killing another human being?

15:58.166 --> 15:59.666
Is that what you think?

16:00.250 --> 16:01.875
Is that what you want to say to me?

16:02.458 --> 16:04.500
Say it. Say it!

16:06.458 --> 16:08.791
You… You of all people--

16:08.875 --> 16:11.833
No. No, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm just…

16:13.041 --> 16:15.083
-I'm confused is all. This…
-Yeah.

16:15.166 --> 16:17.250
Leni, it's happening so fast.

16:23.875 --> 16:25.166
It's the hospital.

16:27.458 --> 16:28.708
-Hello?
-<i>Hello?</i>

16:28.791 --> 16:30.666
<i>Is this the father of Leni McCleary?</i>

16:30.750 --> 16:32.333
Yeah, this is Victor McCleary.

16:32.416 --> 16:35.583
<i>Oh, thank God. We called</i>
<i>because we saw you on television.</i>

16:35.666 --> 16:37.208
<i>First off, she's okay.</i>

16:37.291 --> 16:40.625
<i>She came in as a Jane Doe.</i>
<i>Not really talking at the moment.</i>

16:40.708 --> 16:42.541
<i>We recognized her from the stories on TV.</i>

16:43.125 --> 16:44.375
I'm sorry. What?

16:44.458 --> 16:47.583
<i>Your daughter, Leni.</i>
<i>She's here in the hospital.</i>

16:50.916 --> 16:51.916
That's not Leni.

16:53.833 --> 16:55.791
Let's get Charlie.

16:57.541 --> 16:59.375
I heard about Dylan James.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.875
Wait, how do you know that name?

17:02.458 --> 17:06.708
They were lovers, weren't they?
I mean, in high school?

17:07.291 --> 17:08.541
How do you know that?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.583
Gina doesn't hide her past.
Not from me anyway.

17:19.250 --> 17:21.333
Do you think whoever did that to Dylan

17:23.083 --> 17:24.333
did something to her?

17:56.500 --> 17:58.041
We checked everywhere.

18:01.833 --> 18:04.041
Sorry to come back,
but there was no one out front.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.500
I know. We had an incident.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.250
Your sister's gone.

18:07.333 --> 18:08.166
What?

18:16.708 --> 18:18.625
We had her in here.
We stabilized her.

18:18.708 --> 18:21.250
I went to go call you
and attend to her blood test.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.375
-The doctor found this.
-She pulled the IV out.

18:23.458 --> 18:24.458
That's her blood.

18:24.541 --> 18:25.916
Oh, my God. Was she hurt?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.708
She was disoriented and bleeding.

18:27.791 --> 18:29.791
A truck driver found her
on the side of the road.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.291
Brought her to the hospital.

18:31.375 --> 18:34.291
All right. We need to find her.
She couldn't have gone far.

18:43.458 --> 18:44.916
-Nothing?
-No!

18:45.708 --> 18:47.916
-Leni, why'd she run?
-I don't know.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.875
Somehow, I find that very hard to believe!

18:49.958 --> 18:51.125
Why're you on me like this?

18:51.208 --> 18:53.791
Because if you know anything,
now would be the time.

18:53.875 --> 18:55.375
She is hurt, Leni.

18:55.458 --> 18:57.416
-You did see the blood in there?
-Yes.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.625
What would
she be so desperate to run away from

18:59.708 --> 19:01.250
that she would pull out a fucking IV?

19:01.333 --> 19:03.083
I clearly… I seriously don't know.

19:03.166 --> 19:05.291
She ever say anything about Lake Tahoe?

19:05.375 --> 19:08.333
No. What?
You mean our birthday trip? No. Why?

19:08.916 --> 19:10.875
She marked up some… some maps. I…

19:12.208 --> 19:14.375
I need you to start being honest with me.

19:14.458 --> 19:16.208
-Right now. About everything.
-I am.

19:18.083 --> 19:23.208
My wife is missing. She's gone. Okay?

19:23.291 --> 19:25.375
Something has happened and she's run off.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.416
We know how she can be
when she gets like this.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.583
Would you please, please help me?

19:30.416 --> 19:32.708
This is our family and it's falling apart!

19:32.791 --> 19:33.916
Fuck!

19:34.000 --> 19:35.916
The family that needs me right now…

19:36.000 --> 19:37.250
I'm so sorry, Charlie.

19:37.791 --> 19:40.291
Jack! He fucking needs me.

19:40.375 --> 19:41.458
I'm so sorry.

20:04.083 --> 20:04.916
Hey.

20:05.791 --> 20:06.750
Hi.

20:12.125 --> 20:13.625
-You talk to the lawyer?
-Yeah.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.500
Yeah. We got you covered.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.041
Jack, I know you didn't do this.

20:19.125 --> 20:21.166
Oh, it looks bad though, Len.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.541
The tire tracks. The drugs.

20:23.625 --> 20:25.166
I know, but I think I've got a plan.

20:25.916 --> 20:27.083
Always a plan.

20:29.416 --> 20:33.416
In order for it to work,
I'm going to need to know everything

20:34.000 --> 20:36.625
about Towers and Payne,
the horses, last night.

20:36.708 --> 20:37.666
All of it.

20:38.875 --> 20:40.416
I am trying to help.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.875
Then help me understand
why you took that horse,

20:43.750 --> 20:45.083
of all horses, and why…

20:48.041 --> 20:49.375
Why him, Len?

20:54.166 --> 20:56.166
Look, I know no matter what I say,

20:56.666 --> 20:58.541
you'll think
it's because I don't love you,

20:58.625 --> 21:02.250
but nothing could be
further from the truth. All right?

21:04.416 --> 21:05.958
Jack, our marriage…

21:08.916 --> 21:10.250
It's been hard.

21:10.958 --> 21:11.791
Right?

21:15.541 --> 21:17.458
I'm sorry we made you unhappy.

21:18.458 --> 21:19.458
But you didn't.

21:21.125 --> 21:22.541
It's nothing to do with you.

21:24.666 --> 21:25.750
Or Mattie.

21:29.166 --> 21:30.583
I wanted to be free.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.375
And…

21:36.416 --> 21:39.291
now I know there is no such thing.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.791
I'm sorry for causing all of this.

21:45.875 --> 21:46.916
I truly am.

21:55.916 --> 21:57.666
It's not all on you.

22:00.750 --> 22:01.916
I made a mistake.

22:04.458 --> 22:07.458
We were going broke, Len.
I didn't know what else to do. I…

22:09.416 --> 22:12.250
Towers and Payne called.
I knew that horse was stolen.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.375
But Towers is a big man in town.

22:15.458 --> 22:16.833
He's a good friend to have.

22:18.541 --> 22:20.916
I told myself
I was doing a favor for a friend.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.875
That I was taking care of my family.

22:26.833 --> 22:28.875
That's the most important thing to me.

22:29.791 --> 22:35.666
Taking care of you, Mattie, our home, Len.

22:38.208 --> 22:41.541
You're the most honest,
honorable man I have ever met.

22:42.833 --> 22:44.166
I'm gonna fix this.

22:48.208 --> 22:50.833
Okay. What are we gonna say to Floss?

22:50.916 --> 22:52.291
The truth, Len.

22:53.791 --> 22:55.625
I accepted a horse
that might've been stolen,

22:55.708 --> 22:56.916
but I didn't kill Dylan.

22:58.166 --> 23:00.083
Do you have any idea who might've done it?

23:00.166 --> 23:04.541
No. If I'd known Gina had
access to the drugs and all this…

23:07.833 --> 23:10.875
If you're ready,
the interview room is open.

23:10.958 --> 23:11.916
All right.

23:35.125 --> 23:37.041
-Hello?
-<i>Leni. Thank God.</i>

23:37.125 --> 23:40.250
Oh, fuck, Gina. Oh, my God.

23:40.333 --> 23:42.041
Where have you been? Are you okay?

23:42.125 --> 23:44.541
<i>They're after me, Leni. Towers and Payne.</i>

23:44.625 --> 23:46.458
<i>They got Dylan and now they want me.</i>

23:46.541 --> 23:49.083
Why would they be after you?
Do you have proof?

23:49.166 --> 23:50.458
<i>Yes, I have proof.</i>

23:51.041 --> 23:53.333
Jesus. Uh, where you at?

23:53.833 --> 23:55.416
<i>I'm on the move. It's not safe for me.</i>

23:55.500 --> 23:58.000
<i>I need your help. Please.</i>
<i>Can you come and get me?</i>

23:58.083 --> 24:00.083
Why the fuck should I help you now?

24:00.166 --> 24:03.458
After everything you put me through?
All of us through?

24:03.541 --> 24:06.625
<i>Because I need you</i>
<i>and I love you and I'm sorry.</i>

24:13.291 --> 24:14.916
You're gonna tell me everything.

24:15.458 --> 24:18.125
<i>Everything. Like always.</i>

24:19.708 --> 24:20.791
Where do I find you?

24:21.333 --> 24:23.166
<i>Can you come to Grandma Georgia's?</i>

24:23.250 --> 24:26.541
<i>It's the only safe place. Hurry, please.</i>

24:26.625 --> 24:28.541
Okay. Yeah.

24:55.916 --> 24:56.833
Gina?

25:01.375 --> 25:02.291
Georgia?

25:29.375 --> 25:31.916
Georgia! Georgia, what happened?

25:33.333 --> 25:35.125
Two men came for your sister.

25:35.208 --> 25:37.875
-What?
-They tried to force their way in.

25:37.958 --> 25:40.875
I held them off long enough for her
to get away, but I don't--

25:40.958 --> 25:42.708
-Where is she now?
-I don't know.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.958
They came into the house
and searched everywhere.

25:46.041 --> 25:49.875
They came out here,
but she was gone. And then we struggled.

25:49.958 --> 25:52.208
And I slipped. I… I hurt my head.

25:52.291 --> 25:54.291
-Oh, my God. I'm calling the police.
-Oh.

25:54.375 --> 25:55.541
Oh, please don't!

25:56.125 --> 25:57.625
Today has been hard enough.

25:57.708 --> 25:59.958
I don't want any part of this,
whatever it is.

26:00.041 --> 26:02.291
I've lost enough. Please.

26:02.375 --> 26:04.916
Please, just go. Just go.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.875
Okay.

26:08.708 --> 26:09.708
Ow.

26:15.333 --> 26:17.416
-Gina!
<i>-It's definitely them, Leni.</i>

26:17.500 --> 26:18.541
<i>The horse thieves.</i>

26:19.041 --> 26:20.458
I know. I went to Georgia's.

26:20.541 --> 26:22.125
<i>Is she okay? Did they hurt her?</i>

26:22.208 --> 26:23.708
She's fine. Where are you now?

26:23.791 --> 26:24.625
<i>I'm on the move.</i>

26:24.708 --> 26:27.125
<i>I think they're following me,</i>
<i>but I can't be sure.</i>

26:27.208 --> 26:28.333
<i>You have to help me.</i>

26:28.416 --> 26:30.791
Meet me at the Riverside.
We'll think of something.

26:30.875 --> 26:32.708
<i>It's not safe for me. They wanna get paid.</i>

26:32.791 --> 26:34.708
<i>And I have to make good on the colt.</i>

26:37.083 --> 26:40.000
We got the cashier's check, right?
We got 60 grand.

26:40.083 --> 26:42.500
<i>Do you think?</i>
<i>But how can we get it to them?</i>

26:44.166 --> 26:45.083
I can do it.

26:45.750 --> 26:47.000
<i>It's not safe.</i>

26:47.791 --> 26:50.125
They want to get paid. I'll pay them.

26:50.875 --> 26:51.916
How do I find them?

27:28.375 --> 27:29.291
She's here.

27:50.083 --> 27:50.916
Hello?

27:55.208 --> 27:56.250
Privacy.

27:56.333 --> 27:59.000
-I don't plan on staying long.
-You bring the money?

28:00.750 --> 28:05.166
Now, I know you talked to my husband
last night in some parking lot.

28:05.250 --> 28:08.166
But I hope, moving forward,
we can be more civilized.

28:08.250 --> 28:11.166
We saw him for five minutes
at your boring party.

28:11.750 --> 28:12.750
What parking lot?

28:15.083 --> 28:16.250
I have what you want.

28:16.875 --> 28:20.041
A check? Please.

28:20.125 --> 28:23.083
Made out to cash. It won't be a problem.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.833
That's traceable though, right?
Leaves a paper trail.

28:25.916 --> 28:27.958
We don't like trails of any kind.

28:28.041 --> 28:31.250
That explains cutting microchips
out of stolen foals.

28:31.333 --> 28:34.583
She's got a mouth on her.

28:34.666 --> 28:35.750
Sure does.

28:50.666 --> 28:52.166
This is a bit short.

28:52.250 --> 28:53.666
I can get the rest.

28:53.750 --> 28:54.958
From where?

28:55.041 --> 28:56.708
Your farm's on the way out.

28:56.791 --> 28:57.875
I can get it.

28:57.958 --> 28:58.791
I don't know.

29:00.041 --> 29:03.833
If we let you leave here now,
we'll never see you again, right?

29:03.916 --> 29:06.375
That's only traceable
if someone traces it.

29:07.125 --> 29:09.666
You don't let me go,
that give someone reason to.

29:09.750 --> 29:10.791
Oh, yeah?

29:12.958 --> 29:14.541
Your husband knows you're here?

29:16.708 --> 29:18.500
Hmm. I mean, uh,

29:19.208 --> 29:21.041
if he'll spend this much on a horse,

29:22.416 --> 29:24.875
I wonder how much
he'll spend on his own little filly?

29:24.958 --> 29:27.333
You think my husband got you
that fucking money?

29:28.041 --> 29:31.208
I'll get you the rest,
but I can't do it tied to a fucking post.

29:31.291 --> 29:33.625
Maybe your rich sister
will get us the rest.

29:34.291 --> 29:35.916
You leave my sister out of this.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.166
You see,
some of us know how to keep a horse safe.

29:40.041 --> 29:43.916
My husband is at the police station
right now with the lawyer.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.583
He's having a bit of trouble
trying to remember

29:46.666 --> 29:48.791
exactly who it was who brought that horse,

29:49.291 --> 29:51.458
with the chip cut out of it,
to his stables.

29:52.166 --> 29:55.125
So I don't talk to him
in the next five minutes or so…

29:56.375 --> 29:59.625
He might get a flash of memory
and recall all the specifics.

30:05.833 --> 30:08.583
So if you can be satisfied
with what you've gotten here,

30:09.333 --> 30:10.791
his memory will stay foggy

30:10.875 --> 30:13.083
and you can
keep the fuck out of our lives.

30:21.375 --> 30:23.666
Oh, say hello to your sister for me.

30:42.125 --> 30:45.541
<i>Hey. Leave it</i>
<i>here or don't. I couldn't care less.</i>

30:45.625 --> 30:48.166
You told me to call you.
Why aren't you picking up?

30:48.750 --> 30:52.000
All right. I gave them the money,
but Jesus, that was rough.

30:52.916 --> 30:56.250
Call me back. I'm just going to
keep driving until I hear from you.

31:19.375 --> 31:21.125
<i>You've gotta fix this, Leni.</i>

31:21.958 --> 31:24.666
<i>You're always the one who fixes it, right?</i>

31:43.500 --> 31:44.541
Shit!

31:46.458 --> 31:47.500
Shit!

32:27.500 --> 32:28.416
Floss?

32:31.000 --> 32:32.500
Sorry, can you, um…

32:34.625 --> 32:36.333
Sorry, I know I was speeding. I…

32:37.125 --> 32:39.583
I had it on the open road. I just let it--

32:39.666 --> 32:42.291
Can I get you
to step out of the vehicle, please?

32:43.125 --> 32:45.208
-What? Why?
-Just do it, Leni.

32:45.791 --> 32:46.666
Uh.

32:52.208 --> 32:54.208
-Okay.

33:03.625 --> 33:04.833
What is this all about?

33:04.916 --> 33:07.125
Paula's gonna escort you
back to the cruiser.

33:07.208 --> 33:10.125
If you could wait there for me,
I would appreciate it.

33:11.958 --> 33:13.625
Just tell me what's going on.

33:22.708 --> 33:23.541
Fine.

33:24.333 --> 33:26.208
-Fine. I'll go with Paula.
-Thank you.

33:44.750 --> 33:46.375
-Paula.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.958
Paula, please.

33:50.041 --> 33:52.166
Listen, we're friends, right?

33:52.583 --> 33:54.333
You gotta tell me what's happening.

33:54.416 --> 33:57.375
I don't know what's going on
with you and your sister

33:57.458 --> 33:58.958
and everything at that house, but--

33:59.041 --> 34:01.583
Did Gina turn up? Did Jack say something--

34:01.666 --> 34:04.041
Don't put me on the spot, Leni.

34:05.166 --> 34:08.208
It's not fair. Stop talking.

34:12.541 --> 34:13.916
Shit.

34:26.916 --> 34:27.791
Fuck!

34:35.666 --> 34:38.708
Paula!

34:39.958 --> 34:40.833
Hey!

34:42.708 --> 34:45.500
Paula, let me out.

35:08.333 --> 35:09.291
It is real.

35:11.083 --> 35:12.166
It is real.

35:14.125 --> 35:15.166
I didn't do it.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.416
I didn't do it.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.583
-I didn't do it!
-<i>I didn't do it!</i>

35:29.708 --> 35:32.083
Leni, can I get you to step out?

35:42.208 --> 35:43.125
I, um…

35:45.083 --> 35:50.458
I don't understand what is going on,
but it's a mistake. Whatever you found…

35:50.541 --> 35:52.166
Paula is going to read you your rights.

35:52.250 --> 35:55.125
I will take a statement
at the appropriate time,

35:55.208 --> 35:58.583
but I will have to admit into evidence
anything that you say to me.

35:58.666 --> 36:00.208
Do you understand?

36:00.291 --> 36:01.375
Floss, you know me.

36:01.458 --> 36:03.666
Do you understand?

36:04.750 --> 36:05.583
Yeah.

36:07.125 --> 36:08.875
-Am I under arrest?
-Yes.

36:12.125 --> 36:12.958
For what?

36:13.750 --> 36:15.791
The murder of Dylan James.

36:16.708 --> 36:17.583
What?

36:57.500 --> 36:58.375
Jack?

36:59.416 --> 37:02.166
Please, Jack! What is happening, Jack?

37:03.750 --> 37:05.416
You have to help me, Jack!

37:48.500 --> 37:49.375
Gina.

37:50.541 --> 37:54.041
Oh, yes. She's been very helpful
in finding you.

37:57.083 --> 37:58.916
Before we begin, it's important that

37:59.000 --> 38:01.666
you understand what we now have
in our possession.

38:04.166 --> 38:08.041
Photos of you seeking to
influence witnesses

38:10.083 --> 38:11.791
and the check you used.

38:13.875 --> 38:18.041
This broken knife handle
might look familiar

38:18.916 --> 38:21.333
because it belongs to this blade

38:22.791 --> 38:25.666
that was found
under the front seat of your car.

38:25.750 --> 38:26.625
What?

38:27.375 --> 38:31.583
We'll run tests, but I'm guessing
that's Dylan James' blood.

38:32.375 --> 38:33.916
But that's not possible.

38:35.625 --> 38:36.750
Yet here we are.

38:38.708 --> 38:39.791
So now,

38:41.041 --> 38:43.791
I think you need
to start from the beginning.
