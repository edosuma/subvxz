00:01.806 --> 00:04.268
The best superhero
crime fighter on the planet

00:04.303 --> 00:06.768
is Mr. Spandex Avenger.

00:06.803 --> 00:10.868
Ooh, cute tights. Oh, my gosh.
I totally have the same pair.

00:14.269 --> 00:18.504
Mr. Spandex Avenger isn't
as tough as my robot.

00:18.538 --> 00:20.838
Your robot has
an ice cream tub head.

00:20.873 --> 00:23.105
Aren't those the lights
from Dad's bike?

00:23.140 --> 00:24.605
Yeah, yeah. You watch.

00:25.007 --> 00:27.874
My robot's gonna win the gold
medal at the Robot Olympics.

00:35.549 --> 00:37.216
Sorry, I'm late.

00:37.249 --> 00:40.379
The group project presentation
is due today:

00:40.413 --> 00:42.246
Wall walking.
Let's see it.

00:46.479 --> 00:49.645
- You didn't work on your group project?
- I wanted to.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.913
But Alex wouldn't
take time from Dean.

00:51.948 --> 00:54.348
I like that Dean.
Very nice boy.

00:54.382 --> 00:57.483
Thank you, Dad.
Besides, I made time.

00:57.517 --> 01:00.352
- You were building a friend.
- I have friends.

01:00.386 --> 01:02.454
And they're all
building robots, too.

01:02.488 --> 01:04.723
Hey, we just doubled
our clique. Sweet.

01:06.324 --> 01:08.625
- Max?
- Dad, can't talk now.

01:08.659 --> 01:13.225
Look, working together as a team
is extremely important.

01:13.259 --> 01:16.691
We'll practice wall walking now.
Alex, Justin, grab your wands,

01:16.725 --> 01:19.924
and stand on
either side of Max.

01:19.959 --> 01:24.194
All right. Now,
say "havity no gravity."

01:24.228 --> 01:26.996
Havity no gravity.

01:27.030 --> 01:29.629
OK, Max.
Walk up the wall.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074

01:40.370 --> 01:42.170
Oh! Hey!

01:42.204 --> 01:45.204
There's my emergency hamburger
on the top shelf.

01:45.238 --> 01:49.306
- Alex, Justin, concentrate.
- Dean texted me back!

01:53.443 --> 01:55.510
Your phone's interfering
with my robot.

01:55.544 --> 01:59.179
- Come on, don't...
- Whoa!

01:59.214 --> 02:03.483
...lose your concentration.
Max, are you OK?

02:03.517 --> 02:06.652
Nope! This is an emergency!

02:06.686 --> 02:10.386
And I can fix it
with my emergency burger.

03:07.426 --> 03:09.927
Yo, Russo.
How about a root beer?

03:09.962 --> 03:11.695
No thanks, I'm working.

03:13.764 --> 03:16.564
No, I mean how about
some more root beer?

03:16.599 --> 03:18.833
I'm not thirsty.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.472
I was trying to
get you to come over there

03:26.807 --> 03:29.340
so I could ask you if you'd like
to go roller skating Friday night.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.309
You mean like on a date?
Our first date?

03:32.343 --> 03:34.377
You want it
to be our first date?

03:34.411 --> 03:37.478
No, first dates are sappy.

03:39.013 --> 03:40.847
But we have to go
on a first date sometime.

03:41.181 --> 03:44.449
Not if we call this fun little
exchange our first date.

03:44.484 --> 03:46.751
It was fun.
I had a great time.

03:46.785 --> 03:48.786
Thanks for walking me home.

03:55.325 --> 03:59.828
So I hear you and Dean are going
out on a date Friday night.

04:01.731 --> 04:04.633
How did you possibly hear that?
He just asked me a minute ago.

04:04.668 --> 04:07.803
My robot's got hyper-hearing.
I'm tapped into his signal.

04:07.837 --> 04:09.571
Harper and I have
been testing it out.

04:14.277 --> 04:18.478
Well, your robot heard right.
Dean and I are going skating.

04:18.514 --> 04:21.949
Well, you'd better be careful with
that one because Dean has a reputation.

04:21.983 --> 04:26.386
He is dangerous! He has a key
chain with a bottle opener on it!

04:26.421 --> 04:29.221
He even uses it
on twist-offs!

04:31.724 --> 04:36.026
No, a reputation with girls. There's a corner
of the roller rink known as Dean's Corner.

04:36.061 --> 04:37.728
Where he takes
girls to kiss them.

04:37.762 --> 04:41.331
That's true, Alex!
He's a kisser!

04:46.537 --> 04:49.339
Change channel!
Change channel!

04:53.044 --> 04:56.980
I don't know, Alex! With Dean's
reputation, I'd be nervous!

04:57.014 --> 04:59.214
Oh, would you!

04:59.249 --> 05:02.417
My goodness, Harper!

05:02.451 --> 05:06.487
People make that stuff up.
The point is I like him a lot

05:06.522 --> 05:09.424
- and I'm gonna go skating with him.
- Hey, Alex, good news.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.726
Two couples are gonna
come roller skating with us:

05:11.761 --> 05:14.495
Joey and Kate and that
Zeke guy really wants to come.

05:14.530 --> 05:17.065
So I'm thinking
we should find him a date.

05:17.100 --> 05:21.402
- Maybe you could talk to your
friend Harper. - I'm right here.

05:21.436 --> 05:25.304
- I'm her friend Harper.
- Oh! Nice to meet you.

05:25.339 --> 05:27.640
You're not as weird
as everyone says.

05:27.674 --> 05:31.377
Thank you. You are as scary
as everyone says.

05:32.579 --> 05:34.546
Thank you!

05:34.580 --> 05:36.614
Great, so we're all going
to the roller rink.

05:39.951 --> 05:42.820
A group date? I thought this
was gonna be an alone thing.

05:42.854 --> 05:47.157
- What am I, 15?
- Yeah, Alex. You are 15.

05:48.292 --> 05:51.494
Would you just
let me be mad?

05:51.528 --> 05:54.130
Alex, I just got off the phone
with your math teacher.

05:54.164 --> 05:57.432
- You haven't turned in the last three assignments?
- Really?

05:57.467 --> 05:59.101
That's the first
I've heard of this.

05:59.268 --> 06:00.969
First you've heard
of the assignments?

06:01.070 --> 06:04.070
No, the first I've heard
I'm in math.

06:05.606 --> 06:07.307
Do your homework.

06:08.676 --> 06:10.343
Fine. I need your help
with something.

06:10.377 --> 06:12.345
I'm not doing
your math homework.

06:12.380 --> 06:15.548
No, no. It's about
my first alone date with Dean.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.451
It's gone from awosome to a
six-some. It's totally wrecked.

06:18.485 --> 06:21.320
Oh, yeah! That happened
to me when I was your age.

06:21.354 --> 06:24.623
- But I eliminated the other couples.
- Really? How? What did you do?

06:24.657 --> 06:28.725
Well, I challenged the girls
to a breakdance competition.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.794
You should be good, beat them
and humiliate them into not going.

06:31.828 --> 06:34.762
Always start with
the popping and the locking...

06:35.997 --> 06:37.731
...before you go
into the ground work.

06:37.765 --> 06:42.367
- Like this.
- OK. Wow!

06:42.402 --> 06:45.538
That's good, Mom.
I'll definitely do that.

06:45.572 --> 06:49.341
Oh! I think something popped
and something locked.

06:57.483 --> 07:00.551
Yeah, Kate. I know you had your
heart set on going skating,

07:00.586 --> 07:03.320
but I hear Tears of Blood
arplayinan impromptu concert

07:03.354 --> 07:04.721
in the park
this Friday night.

07:05.122 --> 07:06.922
T.O.B. playing?
Their drummer recovered?

07:06.956 --> 07:09.624
No! I'm trying to
get rid of people

07:09.659 --> 07:11.326
so I can go on my
alone date with Dean.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.094
Yep, they're
totally playing.

07:13.529 --> 07:15.797
I know they're your favorite
band. That's why I'm telling you.

07:15.831 --> 07:19.033
- They're my favorite band, too. Ask if I can go.
- Stop it!

07:19.068 --> 07:22.169
Um, so, um, we'll miss you
at the roller rink.

07:22.203 --> 07:25.705
OK, bye!

07:25.739 --> 07:28.307
OK. One couple down,
one to go.

07:28.342 --> 07:30.609
- And try to keep up.
- I'm keeping up.

07:30.643 --> 07:33.078
I'm gonna go call
the ticket broker right now.

07:33.113 --> 07:36.782
There is no... He why
don't you give me the money.

07:36.816 --> 07:38.617
I'll get you some tickets.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.922
I can't believe it!

07:44.956 --> 07:48.090
Somebody's been robbing delis
in alphabetical order.

07:48.125 --> 07:49.792
They're calling him

07:49.826 --> 07:53.461
"The Alphabetical Order
Deli Robber."

07:53.496 --> 07:56.630
- What?
- Yeah.

07:56.665 --> 08:00.467
He started with the Aardvark
CafÃ©, then he hit the Banana Hut,

08:00.501 --> 08:03.068
and he's worked his way up
to the Umbrella Stand.

08:03.102 --> 08:07.771
- Umbrella Stand Deli?
- It's food you can eat in the rain.

08:07.805 --> 08:11.841
- Oh.
- According to this article,

08:11.875 --> 08:14.543
the robber's been stealing
money out of tip jars.

08:14.578 --> 08:17.445
So what? You don't
give us the tips anyway, Dad.

08:17.479 --> 08:21.080
And you know half that money's
'cause of these dimples right here.

08:23.248 --> 08:25.648
Oh, well, he's also
taking all the cupcakes.

08:25.682 --> 08:29.517
Cupcakes?
What a messed up world!

08:31.152 --> 08:33.820
- What are the cops doing about it?
- Nothing.

08:33.955 --> 08:38.423
I ess they're too busy with criminals
who steal big things like cars and jewels.

08:38.457 --> 08:40.325
Are you kidding me?

08:40.360 --> 08:44.128
I haven't used a car
or a jewel in years,

08:44.163 --> 08:46.162
but I eat a cupcake
every morning.

08:46.497 --> 08:50.531
Yeah, that's why your dentist sends
me a Christmas gift every year.

08:50.566 --> 08:52.332
Wait a minute.

08:52.366 --> 08:56.134
If the Deli Robber just robbed
the Umbrella Stand Deli,

08:56.169 --> 08:57.702
then that would mean...

08:57.737 --> 09:01.438
<i>âª A B C D E F G
H I J K L M N O P âª</i>

09:01.473 --> 09:04.107
<i>âª Q R S T U... âª V!</i>

09:04.141 --> 09:05.908
The Viking Deli
is probably next.

09:06.176 --> 09:08.310
- That's just down the block!
- Yes, it is, Maxy.

09:08.344 --> 09:10.745
And after the Viking Deli,
then...

09:10.779 --> 09:14.347
<i>âª A B C D E F G
H I J K L M N O P âª</i>

09:14.382 --> 09:18.318
<i>âª Q R S T U V... âª</i>

09:18.352 --> 09:21.287
W! Waverly Sub Station!
That's us!

09:21.321 --> 09:25.424
Oh, boy, if only The Spandex Avenger
were real, he could stop the Deli Robber.

09:27.793 --> 09:31.728
Introducing...

09:31.763 --> 09:34.698
...Maximan!

09:40.638 --> 09:45.073
Uh... Max,
what's with the costume?

09:45.107 --> 09:49.810
I'm not Max. I'm...
Maximan!

09:49.845 --> 09:53.680
Defender of the
New York delis.

09:53.714 --> 09:57.116
Dad told me the Deli Robber
just robbed the Viking Deli.

09:57.150 --> 10:02.120
And if I'm not mistaken,
W's next.

10:02.155 --> 10:03.989
I'm not mistaken, am I?

10:05.190 --> 10:06.591
About the alphabet? No.

10:06.725 --> 10:09.093
About everything else going on?
Absolutely.

10:17.300 --> 10:20.035
Hey, Max, I heard you're working
on the alphabet. Good for you.

10:20.069 --> 10:25.206
Dad, never mind about the alphabet.
What I need to learn is a spell.

10:25.240 --> 10:28.243
Something that would
tie someone up. Like shoes.

10:28.277 --> 10:32.447
Like a person-sized shoe
that robs delis.

10:32.481 --> 10:35.850
I got just the thing.

10:35.884 --> 10:38.252
Here. Toss that rope
in my direction,

10:38.286 --> 10:41.021
and say "soap on a rope,
soap fell off a rope,

10:41.055 --> 10:44.187
rope shot out of my hand,
rope tie up that man."

10:44.221 --> 10:46.255
Great. Simple.

10:48.558 --> 10:50.993
Soap on a rope,
soap fell off the rope,

10:51.027 --> 10:53.562
rope shot out of my hand,
rope tie up that man.

10:58.734 --> 11:03.504
- It didn't work.
- That's because you need two other wizards to help you.

11:03.538 --> 11:07.174
- Do you know what you need to do now, Max?
- Yeah.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.943
I need to learn a spell
that makes two other wizards.

11:17.449 --> 11:21.852
Alex, I know I'm your best friend and all,
but there's no way I'm going to Skate Barn.

11:21.887 --> 11:24.588
I hate that big skating
chicken they have.

11:24.622 --> 11:26.856
It's OK, Harper.
I'm not making you go.

11:26.890 --> 11:29.859
Oh, my gosh, thank you, Alex.
You're such a good friend.

11:29.893 --> 11:32.595
Yeah, you're totally not getting
why I'm not making you go.

11:32.629 --> 11:35.131
Oh, I know why.
You want to be alone with Dean.

11:35.165 --> 11:36.866
But I don't think
that's a good idea.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.201
Don't forget about the corner
where he makes his move.

11:39.236 --> 11:42.003
And I'm not talking
about the spinning fly-bys.

11:43.772 --> 11:46.075
Harper, that's just a rumor.
It's not true.

11:46.109 --> 11:47.943
Hey, Russo.
Hey, what's-her-face.

11:47.978 --> 11:50.311
I've got a nickname.

11:54.182 --> 11:57.951
I'm thinking tonight I'll meet you at the
roller rink in that corner by the lockers.

11:57.985 --> 12:01.554
Oh, the corner.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.158
All right.

12:07.927 --> 12:11.829
Alex, hold this.
That's "Dean's Corner."

12:11.863 --> 12:16.266
Harper, there's no
such thing as Dean's Corner.

12:16.300 --> 12:19.703
It's purely coincidence that he
asked me to meet him in a corner.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.672
He asked me to meet him
in the corner.

12:26.098 --> 12:29.801
Mum, I took your advice and I managed
to get rid off of all the other couples,

12:29.835 --> 12:31.302
so now it's
just me and Dean.

12:31.604 --> 12:33.805
Ooh! Which pop
and lock moves did you use?

12:36.240 --> 12:40.509
The thing is now Dean wants to
meet me in his kissing corner.

12:40.543 --> 12:44.011
Oh, Alex,
I'm very disappointed in you.

12:44.045 --> 12:47.747
But I don't want to kiss him.
I mean, I really like him.

12:47.781 --> 12:51.718
It's just I don't want to be like all
those other girls. What should I do?

12:51.753 --> 12:54.921
Well, honey, this is
what you need to remember:

12:54.955 --> 12:58.457
If a boy really likes you,
he'll like you for who you are.

12:58.491 --> 13:02.093
And I think who you are
is a very beautiful girl

13:02.127 --> 13:07.363
who, you know, can sometimes
be a little scary, you know.

13:07.398 --> 13:11.133
And a little devious
and sometimes very sneaky.

13:11.167 --> 13:13.635
And would it kill you to clean
a dish from time to time?

13:13.669 --> 13:17.906
Mom! Mom, please
stay on the subject!

13:17.940 --> 13:20.809
This is about me going
on a date, but not kissing.

13:20.843 --> 13:24.244
Kissing? What's this
I hear about kissing?

13:24.279 --> 13:27.981
- Who are you kissing?
- Dad, I'm not kissing anyone.

13:28.015 --> 13:32.985
- I'm gonna go on my date with Dean.
- I never cared for that boy.

13:33.020 --> 13:37.323
What? Just yesterday you said,
"I like that Dean. Nice boy."

13:37.358 --> 13:42.962
Well, of course he was nice. He was just
using me to get to you and I fell for it.

13:42.996 --> 13:47.266
Darn Dean's winning smile
and twinkling eyes.

13:59.210 --> 14:01.812
Hi, Dean. Here you are.

14:01.846 --> 14:05.248
Second date. Alone.

14:05.282 --> 14:08.150
In the corner.
Just like you said you'd be.

14:08.185 --> 14:12.288
You're kind of just saying everything
you're seeing. Is everything OK?

14:12.322 --> 14:16.158
Yeah. I was just thinking
that we go skating right away.

14:16.192 --> 14:19.460
Because we're here.
At the Skate Barn.

14:19.494 --> 14:22.729
Second date.
In the corner.

14:22.764 --> 14:24.697
Alone when we
should be skating.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.833
You're still doing it.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.968
Yeah, you're right.
Can we just skate?

14:30.002 --> 14:32.970
- Absolutely. That's what I came for.
- Great. Thank you.

14:33.005 --> 14:36.173
Hey, everybody,
reverse skate.

14:38.009 --> 14:41.511
- You really just want to skate?
- Yeah. I love this song.

14:41.546 --> 14:45.047
Me, too. Way more than
standing in that corner.

14:45.082 --> 14:48.484
Sorry about the pile-up.
Let's everybody reverse back!

14:48.518 --> 14:50.619
Really? Are you kidding me?

14:52.488 --> 14:56.557
Um, 'cause I kinda thought
you'd want to do something else.

14:56.592 --> 14:59.092
- Oh, I know what you mean.
- You do?

14:59.127 --> 15:02.495
- Bet I can lap you.
- You don't.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.868
What are you
looking at, chicken?

15:13.106 --> 15:15.574
OK, we've trained
long and hard for this.

15:15.608 --> 15:18.976
I've reprogrammed you with the
latest in digital technology.

15:19.010 --> 15:21.378
We're ready for the big
synchronized robot event.

15:42.165 --> 15:46.668
So you'll dance with a robot, but you
won't help your own brother fight crime?

15:48.538 --> 15:50.605
Yeah. Pretty much.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.974
I got to get to the Robot
Olympics. You're on your own.

15:53.008 --> 15:55.343
No, Justin, I can't be.

15:55.378 --> 15:58.045
Dad taught me a spell to tie
someone up, but I need partners.

15:58.080 --> 16:01.514
- You're going after the Deli Robber!
- I'm gonna stop him, too.

16:01.548 --> 16:04.716
- Spells or no spells.
- No, Max, you can't go out there alone.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.585
- You'll get hurt.
- No. I'm gonna use

16:07.253 --> 16:10.688
- my limited knowledge of tae kwon do.
- You don't know tae kwon do.

16:10.722 --> 16:12.657
That's what "limited" means.

16:16.428 --> 16:18.996
Oh, look.
We're near the locker corner.

16:19.030 --> 16:20.864
Maybe we should
stop there for awhile.

16:20.899 --> 16:22.833
I mean, I know I said
I didn't want to before.

16:23.134 --> 16:25.802
But now that you don't want to,
I kind of wondered why not.

16:25.836 --> 16:29.037
- I don't need to stop.
- Um, why not?

16:29.071 --> 16:31.539
Why don't you want
to stop in the corner?

16:31.574 --> 16:33.741
You usually stop
in the corner, right?

16:33.876 --> 16:36.744
You stop there so often, I
believe they call it Dean's Corner.

16:36.779 --> 16:39.780
Oh, I get it.

16:39.814 --> 16:43.283
You're tired since I lapped
you. All right. Go rest up.

16:43.317 --> 16:45.385
What? No! I...

16:49.790 --> 16:54.493
The spinning fly-by?
Chicken costume? Harper!

16:54.527 --> 16:57.395
What are you doing here?

17:03.935 --> 17:05.301
Feather.

17:07.171 --> 17:09.839
I couldn't go on the skating
date because I work here

17:09.874 --> 17:11.708
and I was embarrassed
to tell you.

17:12.376 --> 17:15.979
You're embarrassed to tell me about a
job where you wear a ridiculous costume?

17:16.012 --> 17:19.048
You went to school yesterday
dressed as a pilgrim.

17:19.082 --> 17:21.415
And what are you doing
in Dean's Corner?

17:21.451 --> 17:25.287
Now that he doesn't want me in
the corner, I want to be in it.

17:25.320 --> 17:28.957
But suddenly I'm not good
enough to kiss? Here he comes.

17:28.991 --> 17:32.928
- Go! Go!
- Stay out of that corner!

17:32.962 --> 17:36.531
Um, Dean, can I talk to you?

17:36.566 --> 17:39.902
There's a lot of rumors going
around about you in this corner.

17:39.936 --> 17:44.238
Oh, man. I was afraid
this was gonna happen.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.474
- I know I got this reputation.
- And if it's true,

17:48.508 --> 17:51.076
it kind of makes me feel like
you don't want to kiss me.

17:51.110 --> 17:54.945
Look, kissing is all some
girls seem to care about.

17:54.980 --> 17:57.915
- I was just hoping you weren't one of those girls.
- I'm not.

17:57.949 --> 18:00.850
That's not all I care about.
I mean, that's all I cared about

18:00.885 --> 18:03.318
the past hour,
but what is up with you?

18:03.353 --> 18:05.354
It's like you're...

18:05.388 --> 18:07.689
OK.

18:07.723 --> 18:11.291
Look, what happened
with those girls

18:11.325 --> 18:14.193
is after I'd kiss 'em, they'd
run off and tell their friends.

18:14.228 --> 18:16.062
They wouldn't even
finish the date.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.931
You think I'd kiss you
and then take off?

18:18.966 --> 18:23.502
- I don't know.
- Well, I wouldn't.

18:23.537 --> 18:26.372
I'd also play that claw machine
where you win stuffed animals.

18:26.406 --> 18:30.008
That's my favorite game.
I won a caterpillar last week.

18:33.012 --> 18:37.248
So, do you want to kiss me, or...
Where did we land with all this?

18:37.282 --> 18:41.050
- You're not gonna take off, right?
- Absolutely not.

18:41.084 --> 18:44.520
Skateboard chicken
dance time, everyone!

18:44.554 --> 18:48.690
And I do mean everyone! Even
you two, over in this corner!

18:48.724 --> 18:51.359
You made me come over here!

19:06.873 --> 19:09.541
- That was nice.
- Alex!

19:09.575 --> 19:12.710
Quick! We have to get Max. He's
gonna try and stop the Deli Robber!

19:12.745 --> 19:15.312
- That's insane!
- I know, but he won't listen to reason.

19:15.347 --> 19:18.549
He could get hurt.
We have to help him.

19:18.583 --> 19:22.452
- What am I gonna do?
- Come on, Alex. Is this the skateboard chicken dance?

19:24.054 --> 19:26.622
Will you come on? Go!

19:30.660 --> 19:33.194
- Max, wait!
- Max!

19:33.229 --> 19:36.463
- You can't stop the Deli Robber!
- I got this figured out.

19:36.497 --> 19:39.732
I'm gonna go over to Murrieta
Clown Supply to buy 40,000 marbles

19:39.766 --> 19:42.701
for 50 cents each.
That's...

19:42.735 --> 19:44.736
A million dollars?

19:44.770 --> 19:48.640
Max, think about
what Maximan would do.

19:48.674 --> 19:51.843
He'd walk up that wall and lasso
the culprit when he least expects it.

19:51.877 --> 19:54.278
Here comes somebody!

19:54.312 --> 19:57.813
OK, we'll do the wall walking
spell to get you up there.

20:00.481 --> 20:02.281
Havity no gravity.

20:16.293 --> 20:18.560
Waverly Sub Station.

20:18.594 --> 20:22.597
I'm going in.

20:22.631 --> 20:24.865
Soap on a rope,
soap fell off the rope,

20:24.899 --> 20:28.101
rope shot out of my hand,
rope tie up that man!

20:32.606 --> 20:34.239
- Nice work, Max!
- You got him!

20:34.274 --> 20:36.708
The jig's up, evil-doer.

20:36.743 --> 20:39.444
You've stolen your last
tip jar and cupcake.

20:40.546 --> 20:41.979
Wait a minute.

20:42.013 --> 20:45.915
How many people
do we know go...

20:50.754 --> 20:52.421
Dad!

20:52.456 --> 20:55.524
- Dad.
- I knew it.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.726
Crime runs through these veins.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.963
That explains my struggle
to stay good.

21:00.997 --> 21:03.832
Actually, Max, I think Dad
made the whole thing up.

21:03.867 --> 21:07.235
- There is no Deli Robber.
- Curses! I took the bait.

21:09.404 --> 21:11.303
I wanted you guys
to work as a team.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.969
Wait a minute. So I went
through all this for nothing?

21:15.004 --> 21:18.272
Not for nothing. You worked
hard! You did a good job!

21:18.306 --> 21:22.075
And I spent a whole month on that robot
and then gave up the Robot Olympics?

21:22.110 --> 21:25.078
Yes! For the team!
Excellent!

21:25.112 --> 21:27.913
And I left Dean after
I promised I wouldn't.

21:27.947 --> 21:33.684
What an admirable sacrifice.
I'm proud of all three of you.

21:33.719 --> 21:36.920
As long as you didn't
kiss the boy, Alex.

21:36.955 --> 21:40.923
Aw, Dad is so
proud of you guys!

21:45.559 --> 21:48.561
- Hi.
- I'm leaving.

21:48.595 --> 21:51.596
- You're like everyone else.
- Will you give me another chance?

21:51.630 --> 21:55.263
- Why should I? - Because I had
to help my little brother, Max...
