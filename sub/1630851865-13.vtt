Go, Ollie!

00:34.640 --> 00:36.080
You're almost there!

00:40.640 --> 00:42.480
Woo-hoo! Yay! You did it!

00:42.600 --> 00:45.519
I... did it! [panting]

00:46.080 --> 00:49.559
Now we'll just fill it with water
and we're ready for our pool party.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.199
But we're still missing our guest.

00:51.320 --> 00:53.000
Yeah, where is Scoot?

00:53.120 --> 00:55.320
He was supposed to be here hours ago.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.199
He probably took a wrong...

00:57.360 --> 01:01.040
Whoa! Ah! Whoa!

01:09.200 --> 01:10.479
Yoo!

01:10.640 --> 01:13.840
[sighs]
That was close. I almost wrecked my...

01:14.000 --> 01:15.320
Ah!

01:15.479 --> 01:16.479
...shirt!

01:17.160 --> 01:18.960
Oh, no! It's ruined!

01:19.119 --> 01:21.880
But that's your special Hawaiian
pool-party shirt!

01:23.320 --> 01:25.240
This stuff doesn't wash out, Moon!

01:25.360 --> 01:27.839
What do I do? Scoot gave us these.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
He's going to be so upset.
We must think of something,

01:31.160 --> 01:32.399
-fast.
-Hello?

01:32.600 --> 01:34.240
[gasps]
Ollie? Moon?

01:34.399 --> 01:37.080
Make that <i>faster. </i>It's Scoot!

01:38.960 --> 01:39.920
Scoot!

01:40.039 --> 01:41.520
[nervous laugh]
Hi, Scoot.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.440
I made it! I took a wrong turn,

01:44.560 --> 01:47.280
and I've been riding the subway
since Tuesday!

01:47.800 --> 01:50.839
Hey! You're wearing your special shirts!

01:50.960 --> 01:53.520
It wouldn't be a pool party without 'em!

01:53.720 --> 01:56.640
Oh, look at that!
Check out that palm tree!

01:56.800 --> 01:58.240
-Hello!
-Now what, Moon?

01:58.399 --> 02:00.520
I can't hide my shirt for the whole day!

02:00.679 --> 02:04.320
Maybe we can zip out
and get another matching shirt fast!

02:04.479 --> 02:06.280
Say, Scoot?

02:06.440 --> 02:08.840
Where did you get
these great shirts again?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
In Hawaii, from my shirt guy.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.000
No place else in the world
sells shirts like those!

02:14.280 --> 02:16.920
No place else in the world, huh?

02:17.079 --> 02:20.079
[gasps]
Ollie, I'm having a brainstorm!

02:20.239 --> 02:21.959
When you have a brainstorm,

02:22.120 --> 02:24.280
I always get dragged off somewhere.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.959
Which sounds pretty good right now.

02:26.120 --> 02:29.120
We should have our party
in Hawaii, by the ocean!

02:29.280 --> 02:32.400
With real Hawaiian food and music.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.320
And shirt guy! Good idea, Moon!

02:35.480 --> 02:39.280
That sounds like a blast!
What do you say, Ollie?

02:40.040 --> 02:42.680
I say, what are we waiting for?

02:42.799 --> 02:45.079
Now, let's go get another shirt!

02:51.400 --> 02:52.519
Woo!

02:53.760 --> 02:55.239
Whee!

03:04.720 --> 03:07.480
<i>Now arriving in Hawaii.</i>

03:11.959 --> 03:12.959
Wow!

03:15.799 --> 03:18.679
Aloha! Hello! Please accept this lei

03:18.840 --> 03:21.239
as a welcome to our beautiful islands!

03:21.399 --> 03:26.040
Lei? Oh, you mean this flower necklace?

03:26.200 --> 03:29.440
-How nice!
-Well, how nice! Thank you!

03:30.160 --> 03:33.079
[sniffs]
Uh-oh, guys.

03:33.239 --> 03:35.399
I... I feel a sneeze coming on.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.640
And my sneezes are big!

03:37.799 --> 03:42.040
Better stand ba...
Better stand ba... choo!

03:44.280 --> 03:45.720
Excuse me!

03:46.040 --> 03:47.000
[gasps]

03:48.200 --> 03:51.399
Eh! No problem! Now let's hit the beach!

03:57.239 --> 04:00.519
Scoot, why don't you find
a good spot for us on the beach?

04:00.679 --> 04:03.359
And we'll go get everything
we need for our party.

04:03.519 --> 04:05.679
Wouldn't want you taking
another wrong turn.

04:05.799 --> 04:07.440
Good thinking, guys!

04:07.560 --> 04:11.280
I see a hammock over there
I'd like to try!

04:11.399 --> 04:13.440
OK, let's go find that shirt.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.800
This is the life!

04:18.920 --> 04:25.560
Hammock, warm breeze, great view
and... aah...

04:25.719 --> 04:28.560
Oh, phew! That was a close one.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.840
Choo!

04:31.440 --> 04:32.760
Uh-oh.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.440
Hello?

04:37.320 --> 04:39.039
-This is the place.
-And here's the shirt!

04:41.440 --> 04:43.520
Oh, no! The store's closed.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.159
"Off for a hike up the mountain.
Back soon."

04:48.240 --> 04:50.240
I guess we know what to do now.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.440
Yup!

04:52.400 --> 04:53.880
Sit and wait!

04:54.960 --> 04:56.680
Would you like cheddar or Swiss?

04:56.840 --> 04:58.479
But, Ollie, why wait

04:58.640 --> 05:00.880
when we could be climbing
the mountain after him?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.599
Why rush when we can wait here
with sandwiches?

05:03.760 --> 05:06.400
Besides, we don't even know
where this mountain is!

05:06.560 --> 05:07.560
[rumbling]

05:07.719 --> 05:09.919
You mean that mountain? Come on!

05:10.080 --> 05:11.120
Uh...

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Moon, do you think it's strange
this mountain is smoking

05:20.159 --> 05:22.000
and the ground is so warm?

05:22.159 --> 05:23.919
Warm!

05:24.080 --> 05:25.919
Yeah, but look!

05:26.080 --> 05:28.320
Hey, mister shirt guy!

05:30.440 --> 05:31.719
Oh, no! Where'd he go?

05:34.880 --> 05:38.120
Moon, I know why
it's smoky and hot up here!

05:38.280 --> 05:39.880
We're on a volcano!

05:40.359 --> 05:42.400
Volcano? What's a volcano?

05:42.560 --> 05:45.919
Just a mountain that spews
red-hot lava! That's all!

05:46.080 --> 05:48.560
Really? That's amazing!

05:48.719 --> 05:51.640
Now aren't you glad we went
hiking instead of waiting?

05:51.760 --> 05:53.200
Not really!

05:53.359 --> 05:55.320
Excuse me, Mr Park Ranger,

05:55.440 --> 05:57.320
is it safe to go all the way to the top?

05:57.800 --> 05:59.640
Of course! With your hiking shoes,

05:59.800 --> 06:03.200
-you're safe for this walk.
-Thanks! Come on, Ollie!

06:03.359 --> 06:04.599
Shirt guy's right there!

06:06.080 --> 06:07.200
[gasps]

06:07.320 --> 06:08.880
And he's getting away!

06:09.039 --> 06:10.760
Stop that shirt guy!

06:14.120 --> 06:16.960
Ah! Yay!

06:23.039 --> 06:25.479
-Woo-hoo!
-As I was saying,

06:25.599 --> 06:27.080
why rush when we could wait?

06:27.240 --> 06:29.240
No time to wait! There he goes!

06:32.200 --> 06:33.560
Hey!

06:34.120 --> 06:37.479
-Hey! Shirt guy!
-Hey!

06:38.320 --> 06:41.640
Wait! No! Argh!

06:42.840 --> 06:45.400
Is that... Scoot?

06:46.400 --> 06:50.120
[muffled] It's a lot darker
in Hawaii than I expected.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.479
We'll get you out of there, Scoot!
A one... and a two...

06:54.599 --> 06:56.280
and a three!

06:57.320 --> 06:59.200
Woo-hoo!

06:59.599 --> 07:04.599
-Thanks, guys. Now I can relax!
-You do that.

07:04.719 --> 07:07.599
We just have a few more things
to get for the party!

07:08.960 --> 07:10.960
[giggles]
Take your time!

07:11.080 --> 07:15.880
I'm grea... choo!

07:17.520 --> 07:22.440
It's a lot more cramped
in Hawaii than I expected.

07:23.080 --> 07:27.120
-Where did shirt guy go?
-He's on that wave! Come on!

07:27.239 --> 07:29.320
-Let's get in the water!
-Nuh-uh.

07:29.440 --> 07:33.120
I don't do water.
Know what I hate more than getting wet?

07:33.239 --> 07:34.280
-No.
-Reminding you

07:34.440 --> 07:36.080
how much I hate getting wet!

07:36.200 --> 07:39.479
I am not budging from this board! Hmm!

07:39.599 --> 07:41.840
Wow, great idea, Ollie!

07:42.039 --> 07:44.080
I'm glad you understand, Moon.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.280
I know you like to rush.

07:46.799 --> 07:51.359
But sometimes the best thing
to do is to sit still, patient,

07:51.520 --> 07:53.919
and... wait!

07:54.560 --> 07:58.239
Please don't say this is me,
on a surfboard in the ocean!

07:58.799 --> 08:01.479
What do you mean? It was your idea!

08:01.599 --> 08:04.599
But the ocean's made of... water!

08:05.039 --> 08:08.239
Look! There's shirt guy! We can catch him!

08:08.400 --> 08:10.560
-Once we catch this wave!
-Wave?

08:10.679 --> 08:13.760
But...

08:13.919 --> 08:15.880
Nice motorboat sounds!

08:16.000 --> 08:19.080
-That's the spirit, Ollie!

Aloha! Let's welcome the winners
of this year's Surf Cup,

08:58.600 --> 09:02.600
two newcomer cats
with all kinds of style!

09:02.760 --> 09:03.840
All right!

09:04.480 --> 09:07.400
Wait. We won the surfing contest?

09:07.560 --> 09:09.880
-Ollie, can you believe it?
-No.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.480
But what I really can't believe
is after all this,

09:12.640 --> 09:15.000
we're still no closer to getting my shirt

09:15.120 --> 09:16.680
and we still haven't found...

09:16.800 --> 09:19.480
-Shirt Guy!
-Congratulations!

09:19.640 --> 09:24.000
You were amazing!
But you really need a new shirt, dude!

09:24.360 --> 09:26.160
Don't worry, I got you covered!

09:28.640 --> 09:31.280
Sorry I dragged you
all over the place, Ollie.

09:31.439 --> 09:34.240
You wanted to wait,
but I rolled you down a volcano.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.520
Best volcano ever!

09:35.640 --> 09:37.240
And I got you all wet...

09:37.360 --> 09:39.600
During the best surf contest ever!

09:39.760 --> 09:42.520
Actually, it was the best adventure ever!

09:42.680 --> 09:44.640
So, you're not mad at me?

09:44.800 --> 09:47.160
I don't mind waiting like you do, Moon.

09:47.319 --> 09:50.600
But doing things your way
was pretty fun, too.

09:50.760 --> 09:51.680
Now where's Scoot?

09:54.280 --> 09:55.880
[gasping]

09:56.040 --> 09:59.360
Is it me, or does that chair
have four paws and a hat?

09:59.520 --> 10:02.400
Don't worry, Scoot!
We'll get you out of there!

10:05.360 --> 10:10.240
Thanks, guys! I think
this flower necklace is making me...

10:11.400 --> 10:12.760
Atchoo!

10:14.040 --> 10:18.400
Oh, no! I've ruined your special shirts!

10:18.520 --> 10:19.880
[laughter]

10:20.000 --> 10:23.839
Don't worry, Scoot.
We know where you can find some more.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.199
Funny story.

10:25.360 --> 10:28.000
This morning,
I had a little accident with my shirt.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.040
You see, just when I finished
blowing up the pool...

10:32.319 --> 10:35.360
What a party! What a place!

10:35.520 --> 10:37.120
What an adventure!

10:37.280 --> 10:39.959
Ollie, I'm having a brainstorm!

10:40.120 --> 10:42.480
We should have
another adventure right now!

10:43.000 --> 10:45.400
But this time we'll do it your way.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.400
I mean, why rush when we can wait?

10:55.400 --> 10:57.360
[Moon laughs]
