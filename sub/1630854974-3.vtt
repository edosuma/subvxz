WEBVTT

00:23.232 --> 00:26.276
- You say something, Rabbi?
- Just praying.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.613
- There's a prayer for this?
- There's a prayer for everything, Sophie.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.535
So, yes, there is a prayer to save
the synagogue from falling into the ocean.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.661
- Rabbi Zucker.
- Hey.

00:35.661 --> 00:36.745
Come this way.

00:37.663 --> 00:40.332
Kids. Nice touch, Reverend.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.711
Thank you so much, Reverend.
That was beautiful.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.796
Thank you.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.092
Just the two of you?

00:51.134 --> 00:54.137
No musicians? Holograms?

00:54.137 --> 00:57.558
VR? AR? Baked goods?

00:57.558 --> 00:58.725
It's just us.

01:08.694 --> 01:12.281
A hundred years ago,
construction began on Temple Israel.

01:13.615 --> 01:17.494
It was built out of hope, out of faith.

01:17.494 --> 01:21.039
It was built by Holocaust survivors
who came to South Florida

01:21.039 --> 01:26.044
and declared with every brick,
"This is our home, and we belong."

01:36.305 --> 01:38.682
I know
that not every building can be saved,

01:38.682 --> 01:41.560
and so, I stand before you today

01:41.560 --> 01:44.521
in hopes that
the Department of Sea Level Mitigation

01:44.521 --> 01:47.524
will look favorably
upon our application for protection.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.945
As a person who believes there is power
in physical presence,

01:52.446 --> 01:54.615
I'm grateful to stand before you today.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.960
They were right over here,
for fuck's sake.

02:48.502 --> 02:52.339
I was at CRISPR Miami,
then I came home, then I left--

02:53.090 --> 02:55.259
Alpha, where are my keys?

02:55.759 --> 02:59.304
<i>Alpha privacy settings
have been adjusted not to track keys.</i>

02:59.304 --> 03:00.931
All right, fuck off, Alpha.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.724
You could try praying to God.

03:03.267 --> 03:06.311
Alpha, does God know
where my dad lost his keys?

03:06.311 --> 03:08.647
<i>Alpha cannot speak
for hypothetical deities.</i>

03:08.647 --> 03:11.942
Gabby, <i>dónde está mis</i>-- mis "llavas"?

03:11.942 --> 03:14.695
It's "<i>llaves</i>," babe.
But that's better than yesterday.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.864
The website suggested
we all wear these.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.574
Did it mention where I left my keys?

03:18.574 --> 03:22.494
Maybe God is hiding your keys because
he doesn't wanna see your face in person.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.579
Enough, okay?

03:23.579 --> 03:25.497
Your grandma and grandpa
love Temple Israel.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.583
I was happy with Temple Emanu-El.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.751
Temple Emanu-El
is not a good fit for us right now.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.546
Because the community there
knows what you did to Mom?

03:33.463 --> 03:36.842
- Why do you have to say things like that?
- You mean, things that are true?

03:36.842 --> 03:37.926
Here they are.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.892
Put your boots on, kiddo.
And get in the car.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.486
It is a time of questions.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.698
As Jews, we have always seen
the question mark

03:59.698 --> 04:01.992
as our favorite piece of punctuation.

04:02.868 --> 04:06.121
And as the Passover holiday begins,

04:06.121 --> 04:09.917
we renew our willingness
to interrogate the world around us.

04:10.959 --> 04:14.630
In our own lifetimes,
cancer has been defeated.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.298
Humans have set foot on Mars.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.091
Despite numerous attacks from within,

04:19.091 --> 04:23.472
American democracy still survives,
albeit without Texas.

04:24.306 --> 04:29.144
This year, energy from the sun
will cook many of our Passover meals.

04:29.895 --> 04:33.357
And yet, for every question answered,
another one appears.

04:33.857 --> 04:37.069
Miami is literally changing
beneath our feet.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.616
Our city is flooded
one day out of every four.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.245
For many of us, it is a time of exodus.

04:46.245 --> 04:49.915
For others, it is a time
to stand and fight for our homes.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.583
Yes. Yeah, that's true.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.919
For me, this year, my prayer is simple:

04:54.753 --> 04:58.298
that our leaders in Tallahassee
will save this building

05:00.300 --> 05:05.138
and that next year,
we will all be together here in Miami.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.437
A reminder,
my mother and I will be hosting

05:12.437 --> 05:16.275
our seder for the climate-displaced
right here in the temple,

05:16.275 --> 05:19.862
this week, for the fifth year in a row.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.905
All are invited.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.740
We close with words of peace.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.536
Please rise.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.342
You know, my father always said

05:42.342 --> 05:45.637
that Dr. Klubeck is the best podiatrist
in southern Florida.

05:45.637 --> 05:46.555
He did.

05:46.555 --> 05:50.058
And Dahlia, I'm so grateful
for your help with the tree planting.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.310
Well, listen, who wants to go?

05:51.310 --> 05:55.105
What, with all this rezoning nonsense,
who can wait for them to sort it all out?

05:55.105 --> 05:56.190
Yeah.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.900
- Be well.
- Hey, you too.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.943
- We'll miss you all.
- All right. Thanks again.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.446
My family's never leaving, you know.

06:02.446 --> 06:06.283
We would come and hear you speak even
if we had to tread water the entire time.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.327
That's a-- That's a comforting thought.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.204
It's very vivid.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.998
- <i>Shabbat Shalom.</i>
- <i>Shabbat Shalom.</i>

06:13.665 --> 06:14.958
Oh, yeah.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.422
Thank you.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.549
Rabbi. Harris Goldblatt.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.967
Oh, yes, of course.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.844
- And Gabriela.
- Gabriela, hello.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.429
- David's son.
- Yes.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.139
And this is my daughter, Alana.

06:29.139 --> 06:32.643
Alana. Lovely to meet you.
Welcome to Temple Israel.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.478
This is Sophie, my assistant.

06:34.478 --> 06:35.395
- Hi. Welcome.
- Hi.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.356
Yeah, we felt like
we needed something different.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.066
<i>Shabbat Shalom,</i> Rabbi.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.944
- Did I say that right?
- Yep. Perfect, Gabriela.

06:41.944 --> 06:45.239
Do you think we'll all be here together
next Passover? Really?

06:45.239 --> 06:46.532
Of course I do.

06:46.532 --> 06:48.283
Why? Do you not believe in science?

06:48.283 --> 06:51.411
Alana wants to talk to you
about her bat mitzvah.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.872
She's been preparing
over at Temple Emanu-El, but--

06:53.872 --> 06:55.499
We're in the middle
of a fucking apocalypse.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.668
- Does God really care about a bat mitzvah?
- Alana.

06:57.668 --> 06:58.794
I care.

07:00.212 --> 07:01.839
I think God does too.

07:04.508 --> 07:05.968
They're waiting for you, Rabbi.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.052
Yes, of course.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.972
Sea level rise doesn't observe
the Sabbath evidently.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.265
If you'll excuse me.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.975
Nice to meet you. <i>Shabbat Shalom.</i>

07:15.978 --> 07:18.063
Really, Alana? Really?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.191
If we have to take care of it,
then we will.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.484
Absolutely.

07:23.694 --> 07:24.778
Sorry, sorry.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.947
I was just welcoming your son
to the congregation.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.615
Did you meet our little Alana?

07:28.615 --> 07:31.118
- So serious, that one.
- Yeah, I did. Yes. She is.

07:31.118 --> 07:34.580
I blame her mother. A difficult woman.
She should have stayed in Israel.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.206
I warned Harris.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.666
I warned him not to marry her.

07:37.666 --> 07:42.045
Well, I think Alana misses those years
she spent growing up in Haifa.

07:42.629 --> 07:46.300
You know, she told me she considers
herself a citizen of the world.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.679
I find that very charming, you know.
Very cosmopolitan.

07:50.679 --> 07:54.850
Yes. Well, what's not charming
is the water in the sanctuary.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.935
- We gotta do something about that quickly...
- Right. Right.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.687
...or there's gonna be mildew,
structural damage.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.355
- Well, I have two bids.
- Yes.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.566
Did you go to Kustom like I suggested?

08:02.566 --> 08:05.027
Wagner and United.
United did it the last time.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.279
- They said to install pumps permanently...
- Who's--

08:07.279 --> 08:09.865
- ...because there's gonna be a next time.
- Who is cheapest?

08:09.865 --> 08:11.033
Just try Kustom.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.410
Just go to Kustom,
like my husband said,

08:13.410 --> 08:15.412
and then we wouldn't be here
having this discussion.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.539
- Go with Wagner.
- Everything-- For Christ's sake.

08:17.539 --> 08:18.957
Pumps are expensive,

08:18.957 --> 08:21.126
and I don't think we need to be
spending for the future.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.586
They said we could fix it with pumps.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.463
Look, I know we are low on funds.

08:24.463 --> 08:27.424
When people leave here,
they take their contributions with them.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.760
But we still should be
planning for the future.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.678
You know there's a future? You're sure?

08:31.678 --> 08:33.054
Have you heard anything?

08:34.640 --> 08:37.058
I have a good feeling
about the presentation.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.394
Yeah, very positive.

08:40.229 --> 08:42.981
Temple Israel does so much for Miami.
We deserve to be here.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.066
Well...

08:44.066 --> 08:46.193
- ...if we'd fixed it, it would be different.
- Go with Wagner.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.237
- Try Kustom.
- If you'd gone to Kustom...

09:06.839 --> 09:08.465
Excuse me, Rabbi?

09:09.675 --> 09:12.344
Alana. Where's your father?

09:12.344 --> 09:14.555
I told him I had an upset stomach.

09:14.555 --> 09:17.766
He's probably somewhere wondering
if I have an eating disorder.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.726
- Do you?
- Do you think God is watching us?

09:20.477 --> 09:21.728
Yes.

09:22.271 --> 09:25.399
Well, I mean, maybe not literally,

09:25.399 --> 09:27.025
but we have to watch each other too.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.403
Okay, sure. Not what I was asking.

09:29.403 --> 09:33.782
Do you think the flooding is punishment
for our bad behavior?

09:35.242 --> 09:36.994
What sort of bad behavior do you mean?

09:36.994 --> 09:38.078
All of it.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.373
- Why else would God be doing this?
- Doing what?

09:41.373 --> 09:45.919
The sea level rise, the droughts,
the refugees, the diseases.

09:46.837 --> 09:49.131
He's angry. He has to be.

09:50.340 --> 09:54.219
If God made humans in his image,
why do they suck?

09:54.219 --> 09:56.930
Or did we just evolve into sucking?

09:56.930 --> 10:00.517
Well, I think we all have the choice
whether to suck or not.

10:02.227 --> 10:07.482
The Torah says
that God is merciful and gracious,

10:07.482 --> 10:10.527
slow to anger
and abounding in steadfast love.

10:10.527 --> 10:14.531
My mom got mad because Dad chose
to start boning Gabriela,

10:14.531 --> 10:17.951
and so she OD'd on painkillers,
and now she's in rehab.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.831
She's also addicted to those CRISPR hacks,
her skin, her ass.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.374
Vanity is a deadly sin.

10:25.083 --> 10:28.170
Well, Jews don't actually
have deadly sins. We just have sins.

10:30.506 --> 10:31.798
And we have forgiveness.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.967
My dad's developing Little Haiti,

10:33.967 --> 10:36.553
and now that the higher ground
is more valuable,

10:36.553 --> 10:40.516
they're buying up all the apartments
and selling them to millionaires.

10:40.516 --> 10:42.935
Will he be forgiven for all that--

10:42.935 --> 10:44.144
Alana?

10:44.144 --> 10:47.564
There you are. I thought you said
you were going to the bathroom.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.483
I lied. I learned that from you.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.776
Aren't you proud of me?

10:51.401 --> 10:53.737
I'm sorry.
Alana's under a lot of stress right now.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.864
I was very much enjoying our conversation.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.825
You-- Feel free to come find me
anytime you wanna talk.

10:58.825 --> 10:59.910
Alana.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.085
Did you use the klezmer music,

11:08.085 --> 11:10.087
or did you decide to go with Prince?

11:10.087 --> 11:12.756
No, Prince didn't really
seem appropriate, Ma.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.676
Prince is always appropriate, Marshall.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.929
- Well...
- "Soft and Wet"? "Purple Rain"?

11:18.929 --> 11:20.806
See, those aren't songs
about climate, Mom.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.851
I went with the klezmer
and some black-and-white photos.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.311
The sanctuary is a swimming pool.

11:26.311 --> 11:29.481
- Everyone's leaving.
- Nuh-uh, no. Not everyone, Mom.

11:29.481 --> 11:32.234
And we need to be here
for the ones who are staying.

11:32.234 --> 11:35.654
Not just the congregation either.
We take care of the whole community.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.867
I would like to see
you find someone to take care of you.

11:41.285 --> 11:44.872
Whatever happened to that Emily girl?
I liked her very much.

11:44.872 --> 11:48.667
I think she moved to Alberta
to live on a commune.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.253
A very warm smile from that one.

11:52.129 --> 11:57.342
- Maybe they need a rabbi in Alberta?
- Mom, this is Miami.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.344
They're not just gonna let it disappear.

12:00.888 --> 12:04.683
Alpha, how many climate refugees
will there be this year?

12:05.684 --> 12:10.480
<i>Estimates suggest there will be
23 million climate refugees in 2047.</i>

12:11.064 --> 12:13.108
What is the population of Miami, Alpha?

12:13.984 --> 12:19.323
<i>The population of Miami is 803,935.</i>

12:19.323 --> 12:21.950
And how many do you think
are worth saving?

12:23.202 --> 12:25.787
<i>That is not a calculation
I am equipped to make.</i>

12:31.627 --> 12:33.295
- Can I come in?
- I'm naked.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.547
I just wanted to say good night.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.759
Thanks, Dad. That fixes everything.

12:51.522 --> 12:54.858
<i>The bid from Kustom came in,
and it's definitely the lowest.</i>

12:54.858 --> 12:59.196
<i>And David Goldblatt called
to ask about the zoning decision.</i>

12:59.196 --> 13:00.614
Yeah, have we heard anything?

13:00.614 --> 13:02.574
<i>Wasn't the state supposed to
let us know this week?</i>

13:02.574 --> 13:06.370
Well, they just announced
that they're saving First Baptist,

13:06.370 --> 13:11.333
<i>the Fontainebleau Hotel
and the dog track at Hialeah so far.</i>

13:11.959 --> 13:13.627
<i>More announcements to come.</i>

13:14.127 --> 13:17.005
- Mr. Zucker?
- Sophie, the nurse is here.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.715
- Dr. Shah will see you now.
- <i>Talk later.</i>

13:21.844 --> 13:25.222
So, there's that old Clash song,
"Should I Stay or Should I Go."

13:26.056 --> 13:27.224
You know the song?

13:27.850 --> 13:32.896
<i>Darling, you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?</i>

13:32.896 --> 13:35.357
<i>If you say that you are mine</i>

13:35.357 --> 13:37.484
Yeah, Doc, maybe that's before my time.

13:38.193 --> 13:40.696
The point is, risk factors are mounting.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.073
Summer's approaching. Mosquito season.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.075
Extreme heat days
are stressors for the brain.

13:45.075 --> 13:48.120
And with her history,
Miami is dangerous to her health.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.872
But everywhere is dangerous. Come on.

13:49.872 --> 13:53.625
We are hearing that hurricane season
this year is gonna be the worst one yet.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.836
The moon is wobbling
like nobody's business.

13:55.836 --> 13:58.547
Wobbling. The moon's been wobbling
since the beginning of time.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.132
- It wobbles.
- It's worse now.

14:00.132 --> 14:03.969
- Yeah, can't-- Hey.
- I assume the doctor told you?

14:03.969 --> 14:07.723
Yeah. Yeah, he did, Ma.
You sure this is what you want?

14:07.723 --> 14:09.183
Want?

14:09.183 --> 14:12.060
The world is no longer interested
in what I want.

14:12.561 --> 14:14.563
The world is in it for itself.

14:14.563 --> 14:15.981
You love it here.

14:15.981 --> 14:19.067
You love the mah-jongg,
the soft-shell crab.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.695
They are making those in Duluth now,
out of cauliflower.

14:21.695 --> 14:22.779
Thank you, Doctor.

14:22.779 --> 14:26.158
- You love Dr. Shah too. Dr. Shah is here.
- I'm moving to Milwaukee actually.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.076
I took the relo deal.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.829
Not bad.
I can share the details, if you like.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.789
They threw in an assault rifle
as an incentive.

14:32.789 --> 14:35.250
No. See, my--
You don't want to move anywhere

14:35.250 --> 14:39.046
- that's throwing in an assault rifle as--
- All my friends are taking the relo deals,

14:39.046 --> 14:42.883
either in Milwaukee or Duluth.
Or the cemetery.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.969
Your mother said
she has a sister in Chicago.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.179
Thought you hated your sister.

14:47.179 --> 14:52.392
It's too hot out
to hate people these days, Marshall.

14:53.310 --> 14:58.232
It's better to be on the first boat
out of town than the one that never left.

15:02.569 --> 15:06.740
- You want me to come with you?
- Oh, sweetheart. You can't do that.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.826
People need you here. They love you.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.829
What is that you always say?

15:12.829 --> 15:16.667
- "Comfort the afflicted and"--
- "And afflict the comfortable." Yes.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.168
Right.

15:18.168 --> 15:20.671
A spiritual first responder,

15:20.671 --> 15:25.050
saving people from drowning
in confusion and despair.

15:27.636 --> 15:30.264
You left Israel to take care of me.

15:30.264 --> 15:33.100
Maybe me leaving Miami now...

15:34.893 --> 15:37.479
is my way of taking care of you.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.654
<i>June 17th, 2047.</i>

15:46.238 --> 15:49.199
<i>The forecast for Miami today
is partly cloudy</i>

15:49.199 --> 15:52.578
<i>with a high of 93 degrees
and 70% humidity.</i>

15:53.245 --> 15:56.748
<i>Be advised, the following areas
are closed due to flooding:</i>

15:56.748 --> 15:59.084
<i>Ocean Drive south of 5th Street,</i>

15:59.084 --> 16:02.421
<i>Coral Way between 22nd and I-95.</i>

16:02.421 --> 16:05.841
<i>South Beach
and Virginia Key remain closed.</i>

16:08.594 --> 16:11.972
I guess I need a new date
for my bat mitzvah.

16:11.972 --> 16:15.684
Some kid named Max Borenstein
has my date here,

16:15.684 --> 16:19.521
and I already learned the portion
for that day. The story of Noah.

16:19.521 --> 16:22.274
Yes, yes. I have been working
with Max on that one.

16:22.274 --> 16:23.984
The story of Noah and the covenant.

16:23.984 --> 16:27.446
- I'm a big fan.
- Yeah, it's a beautiful story of renewal.

16:27.446 --> 16:30.365
That's one way to look at it.

16:30.949 --> 16:33.994
Would Max consider
moving to another date?

16:33.994 --> 16:37.331
I could probably get my father
to pay him to swap

16:37.331 --> 16:40.959
if I promise
to stop hiding Gabriela's birth control.

16:40.959 --> 16:43.670
How would you feel if I agreed to that?

16:44.880 --> 16:46.256
How would you feel?

16:54.556 --> 16:57.768
Why don't we find you a new date...

16:58.852 --> 17:00.270
and a new portion of the Torah?

17:02.272 --> 17:06.944
Something a little bit later in Genesis,
I think.

17:06.944 --> 17:08.153
What's it about?

17:10.239 --> 17:15.452
It deals with a time of great corruption
and justice,

17:16.036 --> 17:19.540
with having the punishment
for evildoing fit the crime.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.875
What we call "<i>middah keneged middah</i>."

17:23.126 --> 17:26.964
I actually had the same portion
for my bar mitzvah, believe it or not.

17:26.964 --> 17:28.590
Nobody has this one?

17:28.590 --> 17:31.760
Apparently, the Gorins are taking
a relo deal and moving to Winnipeg,

17:31.760 --> 17:35.222
so it leaves the date open for you,
if you want it.

17:44.940 --> 17:47.818
It's here, Rabbi, from the state.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.989
Well, Alana, why don't you
take a look and see if it speaks to you?

17:51.989 --> 17:53.240
- Sophie, if you could...
- Yeah.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.324
- Come on, dear.
- Hi.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.286
That is a wonderful...

17:58.537 --> 18:00.831
That's a very, very special portion.

18:00.831 --> 18:02.708
You know, it was the rabbi's...

18:10.883 --> 18:13.760
<i>Rabbi Zucker, we regret to inform you</i>

18:13.760 --> 18:17.639
<i>that Temple Israel is not currently
a candidate for preservation</i>

18:17.639 --> 18:20.809
<i>by the Florida State Department
of Sea Level Mitigation.</i>

18:21.518 --> 18:23.770
<i>If you believe this ruling
has been made in error--</i>

18:32.571 --> 18:33.572
Damn it.

18:36.909 --> 18:39.578
Excuse me.
I didn't know anyone was in here.

18:41.622 --> 18:44.374
- And you are?
- Julia. The plumber.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.168
Marshall. The rabbi.

18:46.168 --> 18:49.505
Really?
I never met an actual rabbi before.

18:50.339 --> 18:52.799
I didn't mean to interrupt
your talking to God.

18:52.799 --> 18:56.136
No, God could have chosen
a better rabbi for you to start with.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.431
Well, I wonder if God knows

18:59.431 --> 19:01.683
where I should put the moisture sensor
for the pumps.

19:03.936 --> 19:05.229
Maybe in that closet up there?

19:06.605 --> 19:08.398
That's where we keep the Torah.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.401
If it touches the ground,
I'd have to fast for 40 days,

19:11.401 --> 19:13.862
so it's not actually a closet.

19:15.697 --> 19:16.698
Can I see it?

19:23.872 --> 19:27.084
This Torah was in a fire in Israel.

19:28.669 --> 19:30.587
Forest fire near a refugee camp.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.757
It was given to me
on the day I became a rabbi.

19:35.843 --> 19:37.135
What does it say?

19:39.513 --> 19:43.976
It tells you everything you need to know
to live a righteous, fulfilling life.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.022
So, are you?

19:50.482 --> 19:51.483
What?

19:52.401 --> 19:53.402
Fulfilled.

19:59.992 --> 20:03.829
Let us all dip the parsley
in salt water twice.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.875
Hard to forget the ocean.
We're the ones getting dipped.

20:07.875 --> 20:09.793
Four days this week.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.378
There's another question.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.382
- I thought there were three.
- Yeah.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.967
The book says there's four.

20:16.967 --> 20:19.261
That's why they call them
the four questions, Gabriela.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.138
Don't be a jerk, Dad.

20:21.138 --> 20:23.682
He was not being a jerk.
He was teaching her.

20:23.682 --> 20:27.102
When you use someone's name
in every sentence, Mom,

20:27.102 --> 20:29.438
then, Mom, you're being a jerk.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.485
Let's hear the fourth question, Alana.
I'm listening.

20:35.485 --> 20:38.780
"On all other nights,
we eat our meals in any manner.

20:38.780 --> 20:43.243
Why, on this night, do we sit
around the table in a reclining position?"

20:45.329 --> 20:46.955
Do you wanna take that one?

20:46.955 --> 20:48.290
Oh, yeah.

20:49.166 --> 20:51.168
"This question goes back to ancient Rome,

20:51.168 --> 20:53.337
when it was the custom
for rich people to eat

20:53.337 --> 20:55.589
while lying on a couch,
leaning on one elbow

20:55.589 --> 20:57.758
as slaves and servants fed them.

20:57.758 --> 21:00.260
Our people thought
of this relaxed type of eating

21:00.260 --> 21:02.763
as a sign of freedom and prosperity,

21:02.763 --> 21:05.098
so we lean to one side,
eating at the seder

21:05.098 --> 21:08.977
as a reminder of how it was
when our people longed for freedom."

21:08.977 --> 21:10.646
I refuse to recline.

21:10.646 --> 21:12.314
Why is that, honey? What?

21:12.314 --> 21:15.692
Because there are many people
right here in Miami

21:15.692 --> 21:20.239
that are working for wages
that keep them below the poverty level

21:20.239 --> 21:22.574
so other people can play golf.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.868
And other people work their asses off

21:24.868 --> 21:29.331
to provide for their daughters
and parents and ex-wives

21:29.331 --> 21:33.752
and yet, are made to feel bad about it
in their own homes night after night

21:33.752 --> 21:38.257
for simply having
the unmitigated gall to succeed in life.

21:38.257 --> 21:39.883
I have another question.

21:39.883 --> 21:43.971
There are only four questions.
You nailed 'em. Now we eat.

21:44.763 --> 21:47.015
I will ask my question.

21:50.853 --> 21:52.980
Why is God doing this to us?

21:52.980 --> 21:54.648
That is my question.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.860
Doing what? What-- What is God doing?

21:57.860 --> 21:59.361
Are you kidding me, Dad?

22:00.612 --> 22:04.032
Do you even see
what's happening around you?

22:05.993 --> 22:06.994
Do--

22:08.078 --> 22:09.997
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Alana.

22:10.873 --> 22:13.125
- Alana, honey.
- No, no, no. Just sit.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.585
Alana.

22:14.585 --> 22:16.879
I love what you said
about the people in Miami.

22:16.879 --> 22:18.380
- I love your empathy.
- What?

22:18.380 --> 22:20.215
Aren't you glad you had a son?

22:20.757 --> 22:21.758
Yeah.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.434
Let's all refill our cups.

22:30.434 --> 22:32.060
May I have your glass, Rabbi?

22:33.103 --> 22:34.313
There you go.

22:36.148 --> 22:37.191
Isabel?

22:38.400 --> 22:40.527
Get to the part
about the plagues, Marshall.

22:40.527 --> 22:44.781
I love that part.
God frees the slaves in the end.

22:45.365 --> 22:48.493
Although, he does seem to take
his sweet time about it.

22:53.665 --> 22:57.961
As we rejoice
at our deliverance from slavery,

22:59.296 --> 23:01.548
we acknowledge that our freedom
was hard-earned

23:02.299 --> 23:04.593
and that it can be taken away at any time.

23:06.345 --> 23:10.265
So, let's appreciate
this time we have together.

23:10.265 --> 23:11.934
It could be our last.

23:13.060 --> 23:15.229
Glad the homeless get to hear that. Jesus.

23:15.229 --> 23:17.439
Sophie. Sophie.

23:18.649 --> 23:23.195
We pour out a drop of wine
for each of the plagues as we recite them.

23:23.779 --> 23:26.657
Blood. Frogs.

23:27.324 --> 23:29.993
Lice. Beasts.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.455
Pestilence, boils, hail,

23:34.039 --> 23:36.875
locusts, darkness, death of the firstborn.

23:36.875 --> 23:40.546
Lice and locusts, they seem like
they can be combined, right?

23:40.546 --> 23:41.630
Get it down to nine?

23:41.630 --> 23:44.258
Passover doesn't have a suggestion box.

23:44.258 --> 23:46.969
You know what?
This year I would like to add.

23:46.969 --> 23:50.138
Corrupt government, wobbling moons,

23:50.138 --> 23:53.141
extreme heat, rising sea levels.

23:53.141 --> 23:55.018
- Amen!
- Amen.

23:55.978 --> 23:58.146
You know,
there is an appeals process, Rabbi.

23:58.730 --> 23:59.731
So there's hope?

24:00.232 --> 24:03.068
We got out of Egypt. There's always hope.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.170
Your father is fondly remembered

24:21.170 --> 24:23.839
for the donation
that made that window possible.

24:25.799 --> 24:27.801
Yeah, he loved this temple.

24:28.427 --> 24:30.846
He would have done anything to save it.

24:31.471 --> 24:32.890
My family's the same way.

24:33.515 --> 24:36.810
We have all benefited
from the largesse of the Goldblatts.

24:36.810 --> 24:39.271
I remember when you appeared
before the board.

24:40.230 --> 24:43.358
I was doubtful,
but your father reassured me.

24:44.026 --> 24:47.070
No, no, don't get me wrong.
I'm glad we hired you.

24:47.070 --> 24:50.741
Although, it sounds like you
shit the bed on the presentation.

24:52.075 --> 24:55.245
I am preparing an appeal.
Frontline leaders...

24:55.245 --> 24:58.457
- Appeal? Look at you.
- ...from all the faith communities--

24:58.457 --> 25:00.417
What, I shouldn't appeal?

25:00.417 --> 25:03.212
Do you know why
the Fontainebleau is being saved?

25:03.212 --> 25:04.671
Or the racetrack?

25:05.297 --> 25:08.008
Or your pal the Reverend McGhee's
house of worship?

25:08.008 --> 25:10.677
Or any of those places
over on Biscayne Boulevard?

25:10.677 --> 25:11.929
Do you know why?

25:13.138 --> 25:17.059
This is Florida, Rabbi.
This is not heaven.

25:17.809 --> 25:20.854
To keep your feet dry,
you gotta grease some palms.

25:22.898 --> 25:24.650
I don't know what you're suggesting.

25:24.650 --> 25:26.735
What I'm suggesting
is that you call my son.

25:28.111 --> 25:30.656
Because he makes things happen, okay?

25:31.698 --> 25:33.867
- Are--
- Harris is a good boy, Rabbi.

25:35.077 --> 25:36.119
He won't steer you wrong.

25:38.038 --> 25:39.206
Okay.

25:43.210 --> 25:45.921
<i>She said, "Why is God doing this to us"?</i>

25:45.921 --> 25:51.426
Yeah, and then she ran off to her room
and listened to the weather report.

25:52.094 --> 25:53.470
Why is God doing what?

25:53.470 --> 25:56.390
She wasn't clear exactly,

25:56.390 --> 25:58.809
but the overall impression
is that it wasn't good.

25:59.393 --> 26:04.064
That God has an issue with us.
Me, in particular.

26:04.064 --> 26:05.315
It's just a question.

26:05.315 --> 26:08.068
You said questions were good, right?

26:08.068 --> 26:10.279
Yes, but they have to be
the right question.

26:13.365 --> 26:15.951
Can you give me
a moment with the rabbi, sweetie?

26:16.660 --> 26:18.078
Yeah. Of course.

26:25.794 --> 26:27.004
How--

26:27.004 --> 26:28.505
Here, let me walk you out.

26:33.302 --> 26:34.595
How can I help you?

26:38.015 --> 26:40.976
Actually, Rabbi, my father says
it's me that can help you.

26:42.769 --> 26:45.981
These politicians.

26:47.107 --> 26:48.442
Filthy business.

26:48.442 --> 26:51.945
Nothing you would ever want
to be involved in. Trust me.

26:54.114 --> 26:55.908
I prefer my work here.

26:56.408 --> 26:58.619
No, of course, and you're great at it.

26:59.244 --> 27:02.539
I know Alana is already benefiting
from your attention,

27:02.539 --> 27:04.166
and she can be difficult.

27:04.166 --> 27:07.002
Well, I mean, we all were at that age.

27:07.002 --> 27:10.964
And we all appreciate the work
you do here in the community.

27:11.465 --> 27:15.427
I mean, you're a real humanitarian.
A "mensch," as my father would say.

27:16.261 --> 27:19.556
"Mensch." That's the highest praise.

27:19.556 --> 27:23.310
Nobody wins from having
the temple sink beneath the waves, Rabbi.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.063
Nobody.

27:27.314 --> 27:30.400
I think we can agree on that. Am I right?

27:35.364 --> 27:36.365
Nobody.

27:38.367 --> 27:39.368
Good.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.301
What part are you doing?

27:56.802 --> 27:58.220
Sodom and Gomorrah.

27:58.804 --> 28:00.013
What happens in that one?

28:00.013 --> 28:04.935
God burns both cities to the ground.
It's a total wipeout.

28:04.935 --> 28:08.397
He saves a guy named Lot
but turns his wife into a pillar of salt

28:08.397 --> 28:11.525
because she maybe forgot
something at home.

28:11.525 --> 28:12.943
Harsh.

28:12.943 --> 28:15.946
- I'm Max, by the way. What's your name?
- Alana.

28:18.407 --> 28:21.743
So, you have Noah
and the covenant, right?

28:24.538 --> 28:26.540
"I have set my rainbow in the clouds,

28:26.540 --> 28:30.085
and it will be the sign of the covenant
between me and the Earth."

28:30.085 --> 28:31.211
Really?

28:31.211 --> 28:35.132
It doesn't say anything about
the red algae bloom in Tampa this year,

28:35.132 --> 28:37.926
or reef bleaching in Biscayne Bay?

28:39.178 --> 28:41.597
My dad's snorkeling business
shut down last year.

28:42.598 --> 28:43.974
Reefs are all dead.

28:45.726 --> 28:48.020
You should come to my bat mitzvah.

28:48.020 --> 28:51.815
I plan on doing a deep dive
into the transgression of humanity

28:51.815 --> 28:53.400
and divine retribution.

28:53.984 --> 28:56.195
I think you might find it interesting.

28:56.195 --> 28:58.655
Thanks. I don't get a lot of invitations.

28:59.448 --> 29:00.741
Alana Goldblatt.

29:02.367 --> 29:03.660
Look at the temperature.

29:03.660 --> 29:08.290
It's not even the middle of the century,
and we're already past 1.8 degrees.

29:08.290 --> 29:12.878
Hurricane season used to start in August.
Now it starts in April.

29:12.878 --> 29:16.673
And the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica,
if God breaks that off...

29:16.673 --> 29:20.010
- Okay, okay. So-- And God is doing that?
- ...the sea level will be going up--

29:21.220 --> 29:23.180
Isn't it God's ice shelf?

29:24.723 --> 29:29.394
Okay, so, is your question,
"Why is God doing this?"

29:30.812 --> 29:35.400
Or-- Or, is it,
"Why isn't God stopping this?"

29:37.653 --> 29:41.240
But maybe the better question is,
"Why aren't we stopping it?"

29:41.990 --> 29:44.451
Right? Yes, maybe it's our glacier too.

29:47.204 --> 29:50.457
Okay. Do you have an answer for that?

29:59.466 --> 30:01.969
The sage Alana Goldblatt once said,

30:03.804 --> 30:06.014
"Maybe it's because humans suck."

30:12.729 --> 30:15.399
Leave the linen blouses.
It's freezing in Chicago.

30:15.941 --> 30:17.150
Just the cashmere.

30:17.150 --> 30:20.237
Okay. You know,
it does get warm in Chicago, Ma.

30:20.237 --> 30:21.697
You might want the linen.

30:22.197 --> 30:23.532
I'm gonna miss it here.

30:24.324 --> 30:25.826
Yeah. Here's gonna miss you.

30:26.743 --> 30:30.706
Not much left on the new map
other than Little Haiti.

30:32.541 --> 30:34.710
Wish they could move the synagogue there.

30:36.128 --> 30:39.715
Well, I actually have reason to believe

30:39.715 --> 30:42.551
that the temple will be zoned
for preservation.

30:43.177 --> 30:45.220
Temple Israel will endure.

30:46.597 --> 30:47.681
You're getting some linen.

30:49.266 --> 30:51.977
I'm sure you would do anything
to save that place.

30:55.439 --> 30:56.565
When do you find out?

30:58.567 --> 30:59.985
Should be any day now.

31:04.573 --> 31:09.119
Alpha, what is the penalty
for conspiracy to commit bribery

31:09.119 --> 31:11.622
of a public official
in the state of Florida?

31:12.164 --> 31:14.958
<i>Bribery is a second-degree felony,</i>

31:14.958 --> 31:17.920
<i>which is punishable
by up to 15 years in prison</i>

31:17.920 --> 31:20.339
<i>and a $20,000 fine.</i>

31:20.339 --> 31:23.634
<i>It is ranked level seven out of ten
under Florida criminal punishment...</i>

31:23.634 --> 31:25.302
<i>The world is in it for itself.</i>

31:25.302 --> 31:27.804
<i>Do you think we'll all be here
together next Passover?</i>

31:27.804 --> 31:29.556
<i>They said to install pumps permanently...</i>

31:29.556 --> 31:31.767
<i>I'm sure you would do
anything to save that place.</i>

31:31.767 --> 31:33.352
<i>There's gonna be a next time.</i>

31:33.352 --> 31:35.521
<i>It sounds like
you shit the bed on the presentation.</i>

31:35.521 --> 31:37.356
- <i>Go with Wagner.</i>
- <i>Actually, Rabbi,</i>

31:37.356 --> 31:39.274
- <i>it's me that can help you.</i>
- <i>Pumps are pricey.</i>

31:39.274 --> 31:40.359
<i>This is Florida.</i>

31:40.359 --> 31:43.070
<i>To keep your feet dry,
you gotta grease some palms.</i>

32:01.129 --> 32:06.009
<i>I'm singin' in the rain</i>

32:06.635 --> 32:11.098
<i>Just singin' in the rain</i>

32:11.098 --> 32:15.018
<i>What a glorious feeling</i>

32:15.018 --> 32:18.730
<i>I'm happy again</i>

32:19.523 --> 32:26.238
<i>I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above</i>

32:26.905 --> 32:32.911
<i>The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love</i>

32:32.911 --> 32:36.540
<i>Let the stormy clouds chase</i>

32:36.540 --> 32:39.585
<i>Everyone from the place</i>

32:40.919 --> 32:46.925
<i>Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face</i>

32:46.925 --> 32:53.599
<i>I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain</i>

32:53.599 --> 32:58.562
<i>Just singin'
Singin' in the rain</i>

33:24.254 --> 33:25.839
<i>Hello, Rabbi Zucker.</i>

33:25.839 --> 33:29.510
<i>The Department of Sea Level Mitigation
had a chance to reevaluate</i>

33:29.510 --> 33:32.596
<i>Temple Israel's application
for preservation,</i>

33:32.596 --> 33:34.014
<i>and we have some good news.</i>

33:37.643 --> 33:42.314
It is tempting on days like today,
in times like these,

33:42.856 --> 33:45.984
to contemplate the idea
of the chosen people.

33:48.362 --> 33:49.738
Chosen for what?

33:51.949 --> 33:53.116
Chosen...

33:54.743 --> 33:56.161
to survive.

33:57.621 --> 34:02.960
I am pleased to announce,
our temple will not be destroyed.

34:03.544 --> 34:05.587
We praise the Lord

34:05.587 --> 34:08.172
for preserving our spiritual home,

34:08.172 --> 34:10.759
and we accept the responsibility
that comes with it.

34:10.759 --> 34:17.766
And we thank our leaders in Tallahassee
for this blessing.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.565
NoYeFe-47.

34:24.565 --> 34:27.943
I encourage anybody who is yet
to get their vaccine to do so,

34:27.943 --> 34:32.072
and report standing water
to the mosquito eradication centers.

34:32.072 --> 34:33.407
- Rabbi?
- Yeah?

34:33.407 --> 34:38.370
Did the Lord really save this temple
or is it the work of a man? A certain man?

34:38.370 --> 34:41.164
- Why would--
- You feed us one day and fuck us the next?

34:41.164 --> 34:44.208
- Excuse me?
- Shame on you, Rabbi.

34:44.208 --> 34:46.837
- I don't know-- I don't-- I--
- We trusted you! All of us!

34:46.837 --> 34:48.589
You all deserve what's coming!

34:48.589 --> 34:51.507
- Wait. Wait, what-- What--
- Hey, hey, you know what's coming?

34:51.507 --> 34:54.261
Social services to haul your ass away!

34:55.596 --> 34:57.264
Mr. Goldblatt, are you okay?

34:57.264 --> 34:58.932
- What?
- Nasty mosquito bite.

34:59.808 --> 35:03.604
No, no, no, it's a cyst.
I get 'em all the time. Yeah.

35:04.396 --> 35:07.900
My son wants to speak with you. Okay?

35:07.900 --> 35:09.318
Yeah.

35:13.697 --> 35:15.365
What did you get me into?

35:16.033 --> 35:20.329
For someone to win, someone has to lose.
I think it says that in the Torah.

35:20.329 --> 35:22.831
No, that's basketball, not Torah.

35:24.082 --> 35:26.960
For what it's worth,
I didn't know keeping the synagogue

35:26.960 --> 35:28.712
meant giving up the homeless center,

35:29.296 --> 35:31.924
but the state can't save
everything, Rabbi.

35:31.924 --> 35:34.843
Only God can do that,
from what I understand.

35:36.053 --> 35:38.472
Where are all of those people
supposed to go?

35:38.472 --> 35:39.890
Not to be a dick, Rabbi,

35:39.890 --> 35:42.851
but, technically speaking,
they already were homeless.

35:42.851 --> 35:44.311
Can't they be that anywhere?

35:45.562 --> 35:48.232
We won, Rabbi. Focus on that.

35:48.857 --> 35:51.527
Think of all the good you can do
now that we're safe.

35:59.743 --> 36:04.373
Alpha, please bring up
all available content for Marshall Zucker.

36:04.998 --> 36:10.045
<i>Social media, published articles,
interviews, purchases?</i>

36:10.546 --> 36:11.547
All of it.

36:12.506 --> 36:16.218
<i>From Alpha social, July 17th, 2037.</i>

36:17.469 --> 36:19.721
<i>We live in a time of crisis.</i>

36:20.806 --> 36:21.890
<i>Not far from here,</i>

36:22.850 --> 36:26.395
<i>environmentally displaced people
are in need of food and water.</i>

36:27.646 --> 36:28.814
<i>And rest assured...</i>

36:38.740 --> 36:41.243
- Go away.
- <i>It's like Elie Wiesel said,</i>

36:41.243 --> 36:44.454
- It's your grandfather, sweetie.
- <i>"We must take sides.</i>

36:45.497 --> 36:46.498
He's dead.

36:47.708 --> 36:51.211
<i>Neutrality helps the oppressor,
never the victim."</i>

37:02.806 --> 37:07.436
He said it was a sebaceous cyst.
Who dies of a sebaceous cyst?

37:08.103 --> 37:10.647
Mom, the doctor said
it was a mosquito bite.

37:10.647 --> 37:14.651
- A mosquito bite.
- What happens next, Rabbi?

37:15.444 --> 37:18.197
Pestilence. Floods. Heat.

37:19.114 --> 37:22.743
Fires all over Georgia.
Famine in Latin America.

37:22.743 --> 37:24.828
Wars in Indonesia.

37:25.579 --> 37:27.998
Do you still don't think
God is trying to get our attention?

37:28.582 --> 37:32.377
God should always have our attention.
In good times, in bad.

37:33.086 --> 37:36.048
The closer we are to the Lord,
the closer the Lord is to us.

37:36.882 --> 37:38.133
That's how love works.

37:38.133 --> 37:42.638
But Alana is right, Rabbi.
What is happening to our world?

37:45.599 --> 37:46.600
Well...

37:49.311 --> 37:51.313
- a man has died.
- Yes.

37:51.313 --> 37:52.981
A powerful man.

37:53.565 --> 37:55.442
- Powerful.
- A man who--

37:56.860 --> 37:58.403
who made a difference in the world.

37:58.403 --> 37:59.446
Well...

38:00.989 --> 38:02.950
But we all will die.

38:04.243 --> 38:06.411
It's not the tragedy of life,
just the end.

38:10.165 --> 38:11.959
To be precious, it must end.

38:16.630 --> 38:19.800
All I can tell you is that...

38:21.426 --> 38:26.306
sometimes faith means that we must
move forward without an answer,

38:28.016 --> 38:31.144
armed only with the knowledge
that an answer will come.

38:32.437 --> 38:33.438
In time.

38:34.857 --> 38:36.525
- Can I help you?
- Stand back.

38:36.525 --> 38:38.569
- Do you understand anything?
- We're here for Harris Goldblatt.

38:38.569 --> 38:40.112
You can't just--

38:43.782 --> 38:46.034
Harris Goldblatt, it's the FBI.

38:46.034 --> 38:48.579
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

38:48.579 --> 38:50.414
His father just passed away.

38:50.414 --> 38:52.249
This man is in mourning.

38:52.249 --> 38:54.459
- Make this easy, Harris.
- Excuse me.

38:54.459 --> 38:57.212
What's going on? I'm the rabbi here.

38:57.212 --> 38:59.548
- Mr. Goldblatt is under arrest.
- For what?

38:59.548 --> 39:02.259
Bribery of a public official.
Conspiracy to commit bribery.

39:02.259 --> 39:04.011
- Harris?
- Racketeering. Extortion.

39:04.011 --> 39:07.055
- No, I don't believe it.
- Look, whatever I did, I did for you.

39:07.055 --> 39:08.140
And you.

39:10.392 --> 39:13.687
And you, Rabbi.
I did what needed to be done.

39:13.687 --> 39:14.897
It's all sinking.

39:15.731 --> 39:18.650
And evidently, I'm the only one
of you who knows how to fucking swim.

39:19.443 --> 39:20.485
What is this?

39:22.029 --> 39:23.864
- It's okay, sweetie.
- What do you mean it's okay?

39:23.864 --> 39:25.449
Would you please stop those--

39:25.449 --> 39:26.867
Just stop them at the--

39:30.287 --> 39:33.916
<i>Hurricane Stanley
is the 41st storm of 2047.</i>

39:33.916 --> 39:38.253
<i>Landfall is expected later this week
as a category 4 hurricane,</i>

39:38.253 --> 39:43.175
<i>bringing maximum sustained winds
of up to 150 miles per hour</i>

39:43.175 --> 39:46.553
<i>and a storm surge
of approximately 22 feet.</i>

39:46.553 --> 39:48.722
<i>Heavy rainfall will lead to flooding,</i>

39:48.722 --> 39:53.644
<i>and residents of Miami's low-lying areas
are encouraged to seek higher ground.</i>

39:55.229 --> 39:58.899
Today, Alana Goldblatt
joins our congregation on this,

39:58.899 --> 40:00.943
the day of her bat mitzvah.

40:00.943 --> 40:03.278
She becomes a daughter of the commandment

40:03.278 --> 40:06.240
and becomes officially responsible
for her actions

40:06.240 --> 40:09.034
in the eyes of our community and God.

40:09.034 --> 40:12.621
Alana is a devoted student,
a seeker of truth.

40:12.621 --> 40:14.456
Today, Alana will speak to us

40:14.456 --> 40:16.625
about the destruction
of Sodom and Gomorrah.

40:18.877 --> 40:20.629
Genesis 19.

40:23.465 --> 40:26.677
You all know that God burned Sodom
and Gomorrah to the ground,

40:26.677 --> 40:31.348
killed 65,000 people,
but the question is why?

40:31.348 --> 40:33.517
What did they do to deserve it?

40:34.685 --> 40:38.188
The rabbis speak of
"<i>middah keneged middah</i>."

40:38.772 --> 40:40.732
"Let the punishment fit its crime."

40:42.025 --> 40:45.779
Were they selfish? Were they cruel?

40:46.989 --> 40:50.242
Were they materialistic
and lacking in humility?

40:52.578 --> 40:54.955
Were they any different than us?

40:56.248 --> 40:59.918
Come on. Did you think God was
just going to let your behavior slide?

41:00.961 --> 41:01.795
No.

41:03.213 --> 41:06.550
There is flooding five days a week
and houses on stilts

41:06.550 --> 41:09.678
because our city now floats
on the bodies of the poor.

41:11.847 --> 41:13.557
So make no mistake.

41:14.141 --> 41:19.688
Category 4 retribution
is coming at us at 153 miles an hour,

41:19.688 --> 41:24.026
and his name is Stan,
the 41st storm of the year.

41:25.110 --> 41:28.113
- So fuck the covenant, saith the Lord.
- Hey. Okay.

41:28.113 --> 41:29.573
Hey, Alana, that's about enough.

41:29.573 --> 41:32.117
God is going to wipe the planet clean
and start over.

41:32.117 --> 41:33.952
And who will he pick to survive?

41:33.952 --> 41:38.874
Clearly not my dad.
He bribes public officials.

41:41.043 --> 41:45.088
I don't have time
to wait for God's judgment.

41:46.757 --> 41:48.425
It's okay. Let's take a break.

41:48.425 --> 41:51.386
That's why I called the cops on him.

41:51.386 --> 41:54.431
- Could somebody stop her?
- Hey, hey. No, hey.

41:54.431 --> 41:56.558
Alana, that's enough, all right.

41:56.558 --> 41:59.728
Now, I'll remind you
as a daughter of the commandments,

41:59.728 --> 42:01.438
you have to honor your father
and mother. Now--

42:01.438 --> 42:04.399
- You want me to remind you of some things?
- Relax. It's fine.

42:04.399 --> 42:07.611
- Alpha, play Marshall Zucker...
- We'll go back. We'll--

42:07.611 --> 42:10.822
...July 17th, 2037.

42:10.822 --> 42:13.158
<i>We live in a time of crisis.</i>

42:14.493 --> 42:15.827
<i>Not far from here,</i>

42:16.662 --> 42:20.374
<i>environmentally displaced people
are in need of food and water.</i>

42:21.416 --> 42:22.751
<i>And rest assured,</i>

42:22.751 --> 42:26.922
<i>any leader who is not trying
to improve the situation is complicit.</i>

42:28.298 --> 42:32.261
<i>It's like Elie Wiesel said,
"We must take sides.</i>

42:32.261 --> 42:36.682
<i>Neutrality helps the oppressor,
never the victim."</i>

42:38.475 --> 42:41.103
But you left Israel, didn't you?

42:41.854 --> 42:44.648
You let those refugees
fend for themselves.

42:44.648 --> 42:46.984
No, you have no idea
what I went through in Israel.

42:46.984 --> 42:49.486
- Or why I left.
- I do know that you stood by here again,

42:49.486 --> 42:50.821
and right here in Miami,

42:50.821 --> 42:54.408
while the homeless you so dearly love
lost their shelter.

42:54.408 --> 42:56.869
- I didn't know.
- Or maybe you didn't wanna know.

43:13.010 --> 43:14.761
You can't just resign.

43:14.761 --> 43:18.807
Yeah, of course I can. That's what you do
when you disgrace the position.

43:18.807 --> 43:22.436
So, we're letting a 13-year-old girl
tell us who we are in the world?

43:22.436 --> 43:26.481
Maybe she should be rabbi.
At least she didn't sell out the homeless.

43:26.481 --> 43:29.109
I don't see what the problem is.
Are we somehow better people

43:29.109 --> 43:31.111
if we just silently sink below the waves?

43:31.987 --> 43:35.407
Maybe Alana Goldblatt was right.
Maybe this is Sodom and Gomorrah.

43:35.407 --> 43:39.203
What are you talking about, Rabbi?
Nobody's turning to a pillar of salt.

43:39.203 --> 43:41.330
We've been zoned for preservation.

43:42.456 --> 43:45.292
What-- Like you said, next year in Miami.

43:45.292 --> 43:47.628
What the fuck?

43:52.090 --> 43:53.759
So, is your dad going to jail?

43:53.759 --> 43:55.344
The Miami jail is already flooded,

43:55.344 --> 44:00.140
so as soon as the bat mitzvah was over,
they shipped him upstate to Raiford.

44:00.766 --> 44:03.727
- Does that make you an orphan?
- Not technically.

44:07.231 --> 44:10.484
My dad still has one of his snorkel boats.
We're leaving soon.

44:12.528 --> 44:15.697
Alpha, when will Stanley make landfall?

44:16.698 --> 44:20.827
<i>Hurricane Stanley is now expected
to make landfall at 8:00 p.m.</i>

44:20.827 --> 44:25.958
<i>Storm surge is expected to exceed 27 feet
in the greater Miami area.</i>

44:25.958 --> 44:28.627
What about the sea wall?
That'll hold, right?

44:28.627 --> 44:30.796
<i>The Biscayne Bay sea wall has been built</i>

44:30.796 --> 44:34.132
<i>to withstand storm surges
of up to 25 feet.</i>

44:36.885 --> 44:38.595
Alana, honey, Max really needs to go now.

44:39.763 --> 44:41.807
I think you'd better leave.

44:41.807 --> 44:43.976
- Will I see you again?
- Who knows?

45:09.543 --> 45:12.004
<i>Fuck 'em. You saved the synagogue.</i>

45:12.004 --> 45:14.339
<i>You think other religions
don't have problems?</i>

45:14.339 --> 45:15.257
Mom.

45:15.257 --> 45:17.968
<i>Your father would be
so proud of you right now.</i>

45:17.968 --> 45:21.305
- <i>You know that, don't you?</i>
- Okay. Mom, why are you using an avatar?

45:21.305 --> 45:22.389
<i>What's an "atabar"?</i>

45:22.389 --> 45:24.683
- <i>Is that a sex thing?</i>
- It's-- No, it isn't.

45:24.683 --> 45:26.727
Is your sister there
to help you with this?

45:26.727 --> 45:30.606
<i>You go back to the temple,
and you tell that Margo Tillman</i>

45:30.606 --> 45:33.358
<i>that your mother knows
she used to give hand jobs</i>

45:33.358 --> 45:36.028
<i>to the golf pro at Mar-a-Lago.</i>

45:36.028 --> 45:38.989
Look, the news is saying
we have to evacuate,

45:38.989 --> 45:41.158
Mom, so you were right to leave.

45:41.158 --> 45:44.369
<i>I thought you were
a spiritual first responder.</i>

45:44.369 --> 45:46.079
<i>The people need you now.</i>

45:46.079 --> 45:50.626
<i>The people of Temple Israel,
they need their rabbi.</i>

45:50.626 --> 45:52.753
No, Mom, I'm not their rabbi anymore.

45:52.753 --> 45:56.798
- <i>I can't hear you. Sounded like you said--</i>
- I said I'm not their rabbi anymore.

45:57.299 --> 45:58.759
<i>Then what are you?</i>

46:02.012 --> 46:04.848
<i>You go back to the temple, and tell--</i>

46:10.229 --> 46:11.480
<i>Civil defense alarm.</i>

46:11.480 --> 46:15.567
<i>The sea wall in Biscayne Bay
has been breached by Hurricane Stanley.</i>

46:16.068 --> 46:17.819
<i>Please head to higher ground.</i>

46:32.000 --> 46:33.335
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:34.044 --> 46:37.464
I didn't know who to call.
The pumps are failing. Too much water.

46:39.132 --> 46:40.175
The Torah.

46:57.067 --> 46:57.901
Okay.

46:57.901 --> 46:58.944
All right.

47:19.798 --> 47:20.674
Can you...

47:31.101 --> 47:32.311
Okay.

47:33.562 --> 47:35.856
- Cover it.
- Yeah. Yeah, like that. Exactly.

47:36.356 --> 47:40.152
Just-- I mean-- I mean, right?

47:40.152 --> 47:41.278
That works.

47:41.278 --> 47:44.489
- I think it's all right.
- Yeah.

47:50.287 --> 47:51.371
We gotta get out of here.

47:55.334 --> 47:57.544
<i>A storm descends on a town.</i>

47:57.544 --> 48:00.297
- Be careful. Watch out.
- <i>Could be yours, could be mine.</i>

48:01.131 --> 48:03.759
<i>The downpour soon turns into a flood.</i>

48:04.384 --> 48:06.887
<i>As the waters rise,
the rabbi goes to the synagogue</i>

48:06.887 --> 48:08.263
<i>to save the Torah.</i>

48:15.020 --> 48:17.022
<i>The rabbi goes out into the street</i>

48:17.022 --> 48:19.441
<i>when Moishe, the butcher,
comes by in a canoe.</i>

48:19.441 --> 48:20.734
<i>"Better get in, Rabbi."</i>

48:20.734 --> 48:22.444
- What about your car?
- Yeah.

48:22.986 --> 48:24.655
<i>The waters are rising fast.</i>

48:25.322 --> 48:29.910
<i>"No," says the rabbi. "I have faith
in the Lord. He will save me."</i>

48:30.536 --> 48:32.120
<i>Still the waters rise.</i>

48:32.120 --> 48:33.580
Look at it out there, Rabbi.

48:37.668 --> 48:42.256
Technically, I don't think
I'm the rabbi here anymore.

48:47.344 --> 48:48.428
Look.

48:50.514 --> 48:52.474
- Can they see us?
- I don't know.

48:55.811 --> 48:57.813
Hey! Hey!

49:02.025 --> 49:05.112
- Hey! Hey!
- Down here!

49:05.696 --> 49:08.073
Hey! What do we do?

49:10.742 --> 49:11.952
We can go up.

49:15.706 --> 49:18.792
<i>The rabbi is trying to get himself
and the Torah to higher ground,</i>

49:18.792 --> 49:21.503
<i>when Benyamin the tailor
zips up to him in a motorboat.</i>

49:22.129 --> 49:24.423
<i>"Come on, Rabbi.
We need to get you outta here.</i>

49:24.923 --> 49:26.550
<i>The levee is gonna break any minute."</i>

49:27.259 --> 49:28.844
<i>But the rabbi waves him away.</i>

49:28.844 --> 49:32.806
<i>"I believe in the Torah.
The Lord will see me through."</i>

49:32.806 --> 49:35.058
Let me help you with that, Rabbi.

49:37.394 --> 49:41.315
Hey. If you could call me Marshall,

49:42.191 --> 49:43.692
I'd really appreciate it.

49:49.323 --> 49:51.200
<i>And the levee does break.</i>

49:51.200 --> 49:55.329
<i>And the flood rushes through the town,
sweeping away everything in its path.</i>

49:58.207 --> 50:01.877
<i>Still, the rabbi clings to the Torah
as the waters carry him away,</i>

50:02.586 --> 50:03.670
<i>and he ends up snagged</i>

50:03.670 --> 50:06.840
<i>in the highest branches
of the highest tree...</i>

50:24.316 --> 50:26.068
<i>...when, out of the storm,
a helicopter appears.</i>

50:26.944 --> 50:27.986
Hey!

50:27.986 --> 50:30.239
<i>And a state trooper calls down to him
through a megaphone,</i>

50:30.239 --> 50:32.074
- Hey!
- <i>"Grab the ladder, Rabbi!</i>

50:32.074 --> 50:33.992
<i>This is your last chance!"</i>

50:34.993 --> 50:37.496
<i>But the rabbi insists
the Lord will deliver him.</i>

50:38.080 --> 50:40.958
<i>- And predictably, he drowns.</i>
- Hey!

50:42.835 --> 50:46.296
<i>A pious man, the rabbi goes to heaven,
where he asks,</i>

50:47.047 --> 50:49.633
<i>"Lord, I had unwavering faith in you.</i>

50:50.968 --> 50:53.011
<i>Why didn't you deliver me
from that flood?"</i>

51:02.062 --> 51:04.857
Come on, Rabbi. Finish it.

51:06.149 --> 51:10.737
So, God turns to the rabbi and says,

51:10.737 --> 51:14.491
"Well, I sent you two boats
and a helicopter. What more do you want?"

51:18.245 --> 51:20.330
I guess we're all homeless now, Rabbi.

51:21.623 --> 51:22.958
I'm sorry, Elijah.

51:34.386 --> 51:35.637
You made it.

51:36.889 --> 51:37.890
So did you.

51:39.308 --> 51:41.143
I'm glad you're alive.

51:41.143 --> 51:42.394
Me too.

51:48.317 --> 51:51.612
Hey, Rabbi,
you never really answered my question.

51:51.612 --> 51:55.282
What question might that be, Alana?
You have so many.

51:55.282 --> 52:00.621
If God loves us, why not intervene?
Why so much suffering?

52:00.621 --> 52:02.497
Yeah, why is that?

52:08.170 --> 52:11.590
Moses, he asked God
the same question you have.

52:12.966 --> 52:14.218
"Why so much suffering?

52:15.844 --> 52:17.804
And if you're so powerful,
why not stop it?"

52:18.764 --> 52:20.933
And did God give him an answer?

52:22.851 --> 52:23.852
Yeah, he did.

52:25.062 --> 52:26.146
What was it?

52:28.941 --> 52:33.237
Basically, it was,
"I'd tell you, but you wouldn't understand

52:33.237 --> 52:35.614
because you're a human, and I'm God."

52:37.950 --> 52:39.910
That's it? That's the answer?

52:42.371 --> 52:45.624
Being human? Yeah, it has to be.

53:01.723 --> 53:03.517
I think the answer is...

53:06.103 --> 53:07.479
it's up to us.
