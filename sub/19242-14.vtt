WEBVTT

01:15.742 --> 01:16.743
Chairman.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.168
It's been a while.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.633
I don't want to talk to you.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.184
Your husband's dashboard camera.

01:43.561 --> 01:44.771
Leave it with me.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.943
What are you doing?
Let go of me.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.195
Hey, Yu So-joon.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.032
I have something I need to ask you.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.938
Damn...

02:37.448 --> 02:39.117
What happened in there?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.123
How could a person just vanish?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.835
What's with that guy, Yu So-joon?

02:50.336 --> 02:52.338
-Hurry up.
-I'm trying.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.423
-That thing.
-This?

02:53.506 --> 02:54.841
Yes, just press that.

02:55.717 --> 02:56.634
I got it.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.933
I'll call you as soon as it's recovered.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.935
Don't think about anything for now.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.064
We'll get in trouble
if you tell your husband.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.400
How can I tell him?

03:13.151 --> 03:13.985
Hey.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.696
You have to bring it to me
as soon as it's recovered.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.656
You better not look at it first.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.701
I don't know what could be on there.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.411
Don't worry.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.290
Let's hope we're just confirming
that nothing happened.

03:27.582 --> 03:28.625
Okay.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.376
-I'll call you.
-Yeah.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.757
It can't be possible, right?

03:36.883 --> 03:39.219
No. It can't be.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.224
Hello.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.103
It's been a long time.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.232
-What brings you here...
-Ah...

03:52.690 --> 03:55.276
I came to see the chairman,
but I don't think he's home.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.819
He's not picking up his phone.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.072
He's probably at work.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.282
I have very urgent business.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.410
I can wait inside until he comes, can't I?

04:06.663 --> 04:09.791
I don't know what it's about.
I'll tell So-joon to call you--

04:09.916 --> 04:14.045
But I'm already here though.
I'll just wait quietly.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.713
Yes, let's do that.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.529
You're doing well with Gun-sook,
aren't you?

04:40.947 --> 04:43.491
Yes, we're always the same.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.541
So, what is this about?

04:52.417 --> 04:53.876
It must be very urgent.

04:54.752 --> 04:57.672
I have something I must ask the chairman.

05:01.134 --> 05:05.138
I happened to run into him
on the subway today.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.181
Well...

05:07.390 --> 05:08.891
How should I explain this?

05:12.603 --> 05:15.523
He suddenly vanished into thin air.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.108
He disappeared.

05:17.859 --> 05:18.735
What?

05:21.112 --> 05:22.613
What are you talking about?

05:22.697 --> 05:25.867
It's exactly as I said. He disappeared
and was gone like smoke.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.372
Right?

05:31.914 --> 05:32.957
It doesn't make sense.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.752
I think that too.

05:36.794 --> 05:37.628
But...

05:40.214 --> 05:41.424
But, the thing is...

05:43.301 --> 05:45.470
I saw it happen right in front of me.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.598
I even had a hold of his arm.

05:49.932 --> 05:53.227
-Are you talking about a dream?
-Your husband isn't normal, is he?

05:54.395 --> 05:55.855
Of course, he's not normal.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.317
He's special to me.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.654
I don't know what you're talking about.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.698
How could someone just vanish?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.241
That is so absurd.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.747
It seems like you know everything, Ma-rin.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.759
My mom is supposed to come over today.

06:26.135 --> 06:29.138
I'll tell So-joon you came by.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.853
Yes, well then.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.189
Pardon my bad manners.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.400
-I came by so suddenly.
-Yes.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.250
What? Kim Yong-jin came here?

06:59.502 --> 07:02.130
I heard he saw you disappear
on the subway.

07:02.338 --> 07:05.883
So, that punk came into this house?

07:07.009 --> 07:09.679
Wow! He's a total psycho.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.641
He said he came to ask you a question.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.644
He insisted on seeing you,
but I forced him to leave.

07:17.019 --> 07:20.148
Why would you let anyone inside?
You are so reckless.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.484
Oh, what are we going to do?

07:24.527 --> 07:26.696
<i>What's he going to do if he saw me?</i>

07:27.155 --> 07:29.991
<i>Even if he tells other people,</i>
<i>would anyone believe him?</i>

07:30.575 --> 07:32.118
<i>Hey, don't worry.</i>

07:32.702 --> 07:35.246
<i>He doesn't know</i>
<i>you're a time traveler, right?</i>

07:36.038 --> 07:38.374
<i>He wouldn't know that much, right?</i>

07:39.500 --> 07:40.460
What?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.254
What did she just say?

07:59.228 --> 08:00.146
<i>Well,</i>

08:01.147 --> 08:03.941
<i>who'd think one could travel</i>
<i>to the future on a subway, right?</i>

08:04.609 --> 08:06.360
Doing what on the subway?

08:07.153 --> 08:09.030
Go where? To the future?

08:09.280 --> 08:10.823
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

08:11.115 --> 08:13.493
He caused some trouble, and got fired.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.828
He's not in his right mind because of it.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.372
The work he's up to is falling apart too.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.666
He got fired?

08:22.668 --> 08:24.378
Gun-sook didn't mention that.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.130
We had reason to do so.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.466
Is that why Vietnam came up?

08:28.549 --> 08:30.051
Where do you think you're coming?

08:30.468 --> 08:32.512
Why is that important right now?

08:32.678 --> 08:33.763
You can't.

08:38.184 --> 08:42.230
Gun-sook said she's emigrating to Vietnam.

08:42.813 --> 08:48.027
She really doesn't want to go,
but Kim Yong-jin is forcing her.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.779
She doesn't know why.

08:50.988 --> 08:51.822
Vietnam?

08:52.615 --> 08:53.491
Yes.

08:55.576 --> 08:56.410
But...

08:56.953 --> 08:58.788
there could be another reason.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.374
For them to leave Korea.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.458
What's that?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.794
I'm not sure about anything.

09:06.921 --> 09:07.838
Nevermind.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.592
It's nothing. Just wash up.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.636
Wash up. Sorry.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.474
No.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.228
Gosh, no.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.983
I can't hear it anymore.

09:28.859 --> 09:29.819
Gosh!

09:31.904 --> 09:33.656
You must have been really startled.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.701
You were caught on the spot.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.829
Why would I be?

09:40.663 --> 09:43.291
If I insist it didn't happen,
what's he going to about it?

09:43.624 --> 09:45.209
Also, so what if he knows?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.044
Did I commit a crime?

09:48.671 --> 09:50.673
Come on.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.843
You don't have to pretend to be strong.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.845
You were scared, weren't you?

09:59.515 --> 10:00.349
A little.

10:01.058 --> 10:04.061
Were you scared?

10:04.145 --> 10:05.938
Don't you mess with me!

10:13.070 --> 10:14.655
Nothing is going to happen, right?

10:15.072 --> 10:18.117
I told you to stop worrying.

10:22.371 --> 10:23.623
Perhaps...

10:24.540 --> 10:28.628
you will be taken to the US,
get dissected, and get locked in a cage.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.463
Are you treating me like an alien too?

10:31.464 --> 10:33.507
You're saying what Ki-doong said.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.719
Besides, why would I get taken to the US?

10:36.802 --> 10:38.888
It's always the US
that does things like that.

10:40.097 --> 10:44.310
If you reveal you're a time traveler,
Americans will be so dumbfounded.

10:46.354 --> 10:50.358
They think that heroes and people
with superpowers are Americans.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.695
We should just show them!

10:55.446 --> 10:59.075
Should we just expose it?
Should we enhance our national prestige?

10:59.992 --> 11:03.037
Let's sleep.
I don't know what you're saying.

11:05.247 --> 11:08.876
I'm so worried.
I'm saying all kinds of nonsense.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.711
It's all coming out.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.756
Let's sleep. Just sleep.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.243
<i>You came to my house?</i>

11:43.577 --> 11:46.539
I couldn't believe what happened.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.457
<i>Are we close enough</i>

11:48.749 --> 11:51.585
to visit each other's houses? Are we?

11:51.794 --> 11:52.837
<i>About today...</i>

11:55.214 --> 11:57.550
it's hard for you to explain, isn't it?

11:57.675 --> 12:00.344
It's not the time
to worry about someone else's life.

12:01.178 --> 12:05.474
-Worry about your own life.
-You punk! You're still showing off.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.561
Hey, do you still think
I'm one of your employees?

12:12.064 --> 12:13.232
Do you want to fight?

12:13.357 --> 12:15.568
Oh... I'm so scared.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.027
You...

12:17.987 --> 12:21.532
You are no ordinary person.
How could I fight you?

12:22.867 --> 12:25.494
You're not ordinary either, Director Kim.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.707
Anyway, I won't bother you anymore.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.626
The world is just...

12:33.919 --> 12:37.798
damn unfair. It is just damn unfair.

12:39.633 --> 12:42.344
I will just have to accept that, won't I?

12:44.305 --> 12:46.515
Just like you said,
I have a lot to worry about.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.100
<i>Hey.</i>

12:51.061 --> 12:56.150
Don't come near me, or my house.
Don't hang around me.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.818
Look at this punk.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.112
Hey. Hello?

13:01.530 --> 13:02.782
Damn it.

13:10.372 --> 13:13.417
MYREITS

13:14.919 --> 13:16.796
You haven't found more
on Kim Yong-jin?

13:17.046 --> 13:21.467
They still haven't found anything
besides the embezzlement of expenses.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.970
We're looking into the buildings
Kim Yong-jin managed.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.182
There isn't anything
besides what we already know.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.559
He's thinking of going to Vietnam.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.812
I don't know if it's emigration,
or fleeing.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.273
Wow, he planned to snatch and run.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.568
We should get all the evidence
for his embezzlement organized.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.903
Then give it to the police.

13:41.445 --> 13:44.657
Once the indictment is submitted today,
they can investigate it.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.242
Two or three days will do it.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.159
Okay.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.663
-Keep looking into the buildings.
-Okay.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.416
I have a bad feeling about that guy.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.253
You take charge of the Kim Yong-jin issue
for me.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.587
Where are you going?

13:59.421 --> 14:01.841
It's a waste of time to spend it
on a guy like that.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.717
-This is work, too.
-That's what I mean.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.761
Just working is a waste of my time.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.221
What about me?

14:07.763 --> 14:10.516
What about my time? Hey, you...

14:12.226 --> 14:15.145
It's not something I should talk about
while doing nails,

14:15.688 --> 14:18.148
but you just happened to come
while I was doing it.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.069
Things are hard right now.
Not everything is what it seems.

14:24.196 --> 14:29.243
You really can't just call me
out of the blue anymore.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.622
Yong-jin gave me an airplane ticket.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.249
He told me to leave first.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.502
Of course, I'm not going to go.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.129
But...

14:40.754 --> 14:43.048
Does Yong-jin have land or something?

14:44.091 --> 14:45.843
It seems like he has a lot.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.303
Land?

14:47.386 --> 14:51.098
He said he has a lot of land
and he's put it up at a low price.

14:51.181 --> 14:54.059
He said he'd come follow me
once that's taken care of.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.436
That's what he told me.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.981
He must have a lot of assets
I don't know about, right?

14:59.064 --> 15:03.360
Well, he must be talking about
the city of Jangho.

15:03.652 --> 15:04.570
What? Where?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.656
I don't know anything.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.159
Please stop asking me.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.787
Why is everybody harassing me?

15:14.079 --> 15:15.623
Secretary Hwang.

15:15.706 --> 15:19.668
Also, you can't keep calling me.
I have my work, too.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.505
Secretary Hwang, I was just--

15:23.589 --> 15:24.548
Sorry, I have to go.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.592
-What's going on?
-Where's Kim Yong-jin?

15:26.675 --> 15:27.885
-Ma'am.
-Who are you?

15:28.093 --> 15:29.887
He thinks he can avoid my calls?

15:30.054 --> 15:32.640
Take everything here
that's worth any money.

15:33.015 --> 15:36.226
-Yes, Ma'am.
-Ma'am, please don't do this.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.311
Please calm down.

15:37.394 --> 15:40.397
They haven't made an official announcement
about Jangho yet.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.567
I could put him in prison for fraud.

15:43.651 --> 15:47.237
No, just tell Kim Yong-jin
to bring my money first.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.741
I can't let him go to jail
until I get all my money back.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.534
What is she saying?

15:53.118 --> 15:55.663
Ma'am, this is illegal.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.206
-Excuse me.
-What is she saying?

15:57.289 --> 15:58.207
You can't do that!

16:01.001 --> 16:05.130
Have you heard rumors
about buildings being put for sale?

16:05.214 --> 16:08.258
Or have you seen people
come to look at buildings?

16:08.342 --> 16:09.385
No, not at all.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.640
Has Director Kim Yong-jin come around here
at all?

16:14.723 --> 16:15.641
That man?

16:16.642 --> 16:20.562
Director Kim is a person who is always
on his phone and talking about money.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.151
Yes, I understand. Thank you for today.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.653
Yes, goodbye.

16:27.736 --> 16:28.862
Thank you.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.289
It's not like I'm a detective.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.042
This is all I'll do for today.

16:48.007 --> 16:52.553
What is our Se-young up to?

16:58.517 --> 17:00.269
Hey, Se-young.

17:00.686 --> 17:05.149
I'm near your office because of work.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.109
Do you have time for coffee?

17:07.526 --> 17:09.862
I don't know. I'm a bit busy.

17:09.987 --> 17:13.032
Just come out. I'm near your office.

17:13.490 --> 17:14.491
Aren't you at work?

17:15.284 --> 17:18.245
Huh? Of course, I'm at work.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.621
You don't hear the office?

17:20.289 --> 17:22.583
<i>There are sounds to an office?</i>
<i>What are you saying?</i>

17:23.667 --> 17:27.337
Well, you could wait for me
at the cafe we always go to.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.549
<i>I need to finish some work,</i>
<i>so I can't go right away.</i>

17:30.632 --> 17:32.634
Okay, that's fine. Take your time.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.553
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

17:36.263 --> 17:38.057
It'll take forever to get back to work.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.312
No, it'll take me 30 minutes
to get to her office.

17:44.646 --> 17:45.481
Run.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.694
Why are you so out of breath?

17:51.653 --> 17:55.365
I had to move some things.
Some heavy stuff.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.537
Why are you sweating so much?

18:00.829 --> 18:03.749
Oh, this? I'm not feeling so great lately.

18:05.959 --> 18:08.378
Why are you moving things?
You're even strong.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.547
I'm not having cold sweats, like you.

18:12.466 --> 18:15.385
Get some coffee. Buy something cold.

18:16.845 --> 18:19.181
-I'm thirsty.
-Okay, I'll get it.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.192
Why are you smiling?

18:32.486 --> 18:33.320
Was I?

18:34.905 --> 18:36.990
I didn't. I didn't smile.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.665
You weren't at work, were you?

18:48.710 --> 18:50.170
What's with that expression?

18:51.547 --> 18:54.925
What about you? I don't think
you were near my work either.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.970
Are you sure you didn't lie
and hurry over?

18:58.053 --> 19:00.848
How do you know me so well?
It's as if you did the same thing.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.561
Seriously, you must want to die.

19:08.105 --> 19:11.108
Shin Se-young,
you weren't at work, were you?

19:11.191 --> 19:12.985
-I said I was.
-Really?

19:14.194 --> 19:17.197
-You weren't either.
-Of course not.

19:17.823 --> 19:22.161
Hey, I ran so much that I think
my heart is going to explode.

19:23.662 --> 19:27.040
-I'm so darn happy.
-What are you so darn happy about?

19:27.916 --> 19:29.418
My goodness.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.713
You ran here to see me.

19:35.632 --> 19:36.800
I'm so darn happy.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.011
My gosh.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.763
Dashboard camera...

19:42.723 --> 19:45.642
It's harder to recover
than other data storage methods.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.144
I cannot provide guarantees.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.273
I really want to see the footage
from October 27th.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.151
Taking the approach
with a higher success rate

19:54.234 --> 19:55.569
will drive up the cost.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.154
That's not a problem.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.073
How long will it take?

20:01.241 --> 20:02.993
If recovery is possible,

20:03.243 --> 20:05.162
it'll be available
by the end of the month.

20:05.412 --> 20:06.747
The end of this month?

20:09.208 --> 20:12.586
November 30.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.382
-Please try your best.
-Yes, I will.

20:17.841 --> 20:21.220
DATA RECOVERY PROFESSIONALS

20:22.387 --> 20:24.014
I'm not sure of anything.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.060
For now...

20:29.269 --> 20:31.980
I will confirm it before I tell Realtor.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.366
Hello.

20:44.618 --> 20:48.497
-What do you mean, asset division?
-You haven't heard about it?

20:50.082 --> 20:53.877
Half of the chairman's assets
are going to you.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.131
I haven't heard about it.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.345
He didn't even show off about it.

21:03.512 --> 21:07.224
He must really have fallen deeply for you.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.019
Aren't I right?

21:11.520 --> 21:14.189
Honestly, you're still newlyweds.

21:14.731 --> 21:19.569
But just splitting your assets in half
is normally a difficult thing to do.

21:20.195 --> 21:23.031
It isn't as if he knows
the day of his death or anything.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.708
Well... there is something
you must prepare.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.877
I need your resident registration
and your seal.

21:36.253 --> 21:39.047
Also, if you assign me as your attorney--

21:39.131 --> 21:41.842
I'm sorry, but...

21:43.093 --> 21:45.637
I think I need to talk to So-joon first.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.265
Ma-rin's dad?

21:50.225 --> 21:52.477
I think maybe it's time to look for him.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.272
What do you think, Mother?

21:56.064 --> 21:58.317
Why would you suddenly bring him up?

21:59.359 --> 22:01.820
I think Ma-rin might be curious about him.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.698
Aren't you curious, Mother?

22:04.948 --> 22:07.492
I'm tired of it all.

22:09.202 --> 22:10.579
I don't want to get involved.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.502
Does Ma-rin want to look for him?

22:18.170 --> 22:20.630
She doesn't make it obvious,
but I think so.

22:21.214 --> 22:24.009
What is he doing
and what kind of person is he?

22:24.968 --> 22:26.053
I'm sure she's curious.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.391
Then ask Ma-rin first.

22:32.517 --> 22:35.771
If she wants to look for him,
I can't stop her.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.856
Then do you have any information on him?

22:38.982 --> 22:41.109
His resident registration number
or a picture?

22:41.568 --> 22:43.528
If you have anything,
I can look right away.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.448
I can probably find him in a day or two.

22:46.531 --> 22:48.200
Ask Ma-rin first.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.162
If she finds out you did it
behind her back,

22:52.245 --> 22:53.747
she's going to make a huge fuss.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.249
Right? She would.

22:58.293 --> 23:00.253
It looks like we speak the same language.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.005
She makes a huge fuss all the time.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.510
Did you enjoy your food?

23:06.635 --> 23:08.637
It was so good.
I should've taken some to go.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.139
That's good. I'll drive you home.

23:11.306 --> 23:13.141
Oh no. My house is right there.

23:13.266 --> 23:16.144
-No, I'll just drive you.
-Wait, Son.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.189
I feel so ashamed.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.651
Your in-laws have nothing to offer you.

23:23.485 --> 23:27.239
I was so ignorant last time
when I rolled around on the ground.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.116
-Mom.
-Huh?

23:29.950 --> 23:31.368
It's okay.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.454
You said I'm your son.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.998
You just call me Son, that's all.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.626
There are many things
that hurt my feelings.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.838
Oh, my cute son.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.757
There are many things
I haven't brought up.

23:45.841 --> 23:49.428
Who does this to a son?
Isn't this sexual harassment?

23:50.220 --> 23:52.222
I like you so much. What am I to do?

23:53.390 --> 23:54.641
You're so cute.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.311
Ma-rin!

24:00.230 --> 24:01.982
Your husband is home.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.151
Where are you?

24:08.238 --> 24:09.197
Is she not here?

24:12.993 --> 24:14.286
Ma-rin!

24:15.162 --> 24:16.538
Ma-rin!

24:18.540 --> 24:19.666
There you are.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.710
Oh, you're home?

24:22.794 --> 24:25.380
What are you doing there?
You didn't know I came home.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.717
Sorry, I was thinking about something.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.679
About what?

24:40.395 --> 24:44.024
Did something bad happen?
You look like you're in a bad mood.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.402
No.

24:49.696 --> 24:50.614
Eat this.

24:51.781 --> 24:53.158
I heard you had dinner.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.206
Here. You eat it too.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.666
Your health is important, too.

25:03.835 --> 25:04.753
Thank you.

25:08.673 --> 25:11.551
You even look cute when you take medicine.

25:12.427 --> 25:13.428
Why the flattery?

25:14.387 --> 25:17.057
-Do you have a favor to ask?
-What favor?

25:18.600 --> 25:19.518
Well...

25:21.102 --> 25:22.687
Should I find your father for you?

25:25.357 --> 25:29.069
Your dad. I mean, Mother's husband.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.656
He would be my father-in-law.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.700
Should I just call him Father?

25:38.954 --> 25:41.957
I want to look for him.
I thought I should ask you what you think.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.459
Why?

25:45.752 --> 25:47.546
Why would you suddenly look for my dad?

25:48.630 --> 25:51.633
Well... You can't not look forever.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.139
Ma... Ma-rin.

26:00.308 --> 26:02.435
You don't need to be so sensitive
about it.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.273
Why are you acting like this?

26:07.399 --> 26:08.525
Are you going somewhere?

26:09.401 --> 26:12.696
You fought with your mom
over your dad recently.

26:14.489 --> 26:15.657
Yu So-joon.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.410
I'm your wife.

26:19.327 --> 26:22.998
I can get a sense of what you're thinking
when I look at your eyes.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.335
Is something happening again?

26:27.836 --> 26:29.629
What would happen to us?

26:29.713 --> 26:33.341
I met your lawyer today.

26:34.634 --> 26:37.304
He brought up some ridiculous stuff
about asset division.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.888
Shouldn't you be happy?

26:39.097 --> 26:40.849
I'm sharing everything with you.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.309
Why all of a sudden?

26:43.143 --> 26:45.562
Why would you suddenly transfer
what's yours to me?

26:46.021 --> 26:49.858
You're being so good to me lately.
Now, you want to find my dad for me.

26:51.818 --> 26:53.194
Can't I be good to you?

26:53.278 --> 26:55.322
Why do you suddenly
want to be so good to me?

26:56.364 --> 26:58.408
I feel like
I wasn't so good to you so far.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.202
"I'm so lucky to have found this man."

27:01.536 --> 27:03.288
I want you to fall head over heels.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.374
Then I'll feel proud about that.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.046
There's really nothing wrong?

27:12.172 --> 27:13.340
Of course not.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.133
You're acting strange.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.886
It's like you're getting ready to leave.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.680
Where would I leave? This is my home.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.516
There's really nothing wrong?

27:24.559 --> 27:25.518
No.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.026
Do you know how scared I was?

27:33.318 --> 27:36.529
Why are you acting out of character
and scaring me?

27:36.863 --> 27:40.283
This is what it feels like to get cursed
after being good to someone.

27:40.617 --> 27:41.951
Don't be good to me.

27:42.285 --> 27:45.664
And don't give me what's yours.
Don't buy me gifts.

27:46.665 --> 27:47.499
Then...

27:48.792 --> 27:50.377
should I just breathe next to you?

27:56.466 --> 27:58.301
You're too good for me.

27:59.594 --> 28:02.806
I fall head over heels for you every day.

28:05.141 --> 28:06.309
So...

28:07.686 --> 28:11.064
Just let's just wake up together
in the mornings.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.274
Send me a text when you're at work.

28:13.775 --> 28:16.611
Let's have dinner together
and watch a movie.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.113
Let's fall asleep together.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.157
That's enough for me.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.412
Don't scare me by doing strange things.

28:28.039 --> 28:31.793
Honestly, I should be carrying you
on my back, living in this luxury.

28:33.002 --> 28:34.295
Do you get what I'm saying?

28:35.588 --> 28:38.800
How are you going to live without me?

28:40.552 --> 28:44.264
How would I live without you?
Don't say such a horrible thing.

28:54.315 --> 28:56.860
Yes, I'm here.

28:57.652 --> 28:58.486
Okay.

28:59.404 --> 29:02.157
Director Kim Yong-jin has come by
often lately.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.243
He came by often?

29:05.869 --> 29:10.165
Yes. He met often with the President
of  Sungjin Produce from this building.

29:11.499 --> 29:12.625
Oh, President Choi.

29:12.876 --> 29:15.211
Have you seen him today?
Can I meet him?

29:15.336 --> 29:17.797
Gosh... he passed away.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.090
You didn't know?

29:20.550 --> 29:21.468
How?

29:21.843 --> 29:25.346
He went fishing at night, alone,
and got into an accident.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.016
It seems he got drunk
and fell into the water.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.485
-So-joon.
-Yeah?

29:41.070 --> 29:42.655
I just heard something weird.

29:44.324 --> 29:47.535
-He died?
-Yeah.

29:48.661 --> 29:50.955
The timing of it is just odd.

29:52.081 --> 29:54.334
Kim Yong-jin
had been by there quite often.

29:55.293 --> 29:56.836
There's something weirder.

29:57.754 --> 30:02.592
President Choi had been telling people
that he would own the building.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.803
People thought he was exaggerating.

30:08.932 --> 30:11.768
If Kim Yong-jin had been committing fraud
with contracts.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.561
It's highly likely it was with him.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.271
Exactly.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.733
But, he passed away.

30:21.694 --> 30:23.905
<i>Right. There's a company</i>
<i>called Sungjin Produce.</i>

30:24.405 --> 30:26.616
I have an old classmate there,
President Choi.

30:26.866 --> 30:28.451
He said he's buying that building.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.620
You said Sungjin Produce, right?

30:32.580 --> 30:34.791
Why? Do you know something?

30:35.458 --> 30:39.796
Hey, call the police.
Ask them to rush Kim Yong-jin's subpoena.

30:40.463 --> 30:41.506
Okay.

30:51.307 --> 30:53.309
Yes, Detective. Hello.

30:53.476 --> 30:55.979
This is Manager Kang Ki-doong calling
from Myreits.

30:57.605 --> 30:59.858
-So-joon, wait.
-What is it?

30:59.941 --> 31:02.610
-Kim Yong-jin's already on the run.
-Goodness.

31:02.735 --> 31:05.947
I think creditors showed up at his place.
He already disappeared.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.326
All right, I'll look into things.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.579
You look into things too.
Let's talk later.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.751
Are you certain that Kim Yong-jin
embezzled nine billion won?

31:18.918 --> 31:20.587
Tell me everything you know.

31:22.755 --> 31:24.757
Yes, he definitely did it.

31:25.633 --> 31:28.511
But there's no evidence,
even in the future.

31:29.637 --> 31:32.432
So he runs off to a foreign country
without leaving evidence.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.518
Did Kim Yong-jin happen to...

31:38.855 --> 31:40.481
kill a person too?

31:42.567 --> 31:43.902
What do you mean?

31:44.152 --> 31:46.654
Someone that had been communicating
with him has died.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.615
Something feels off about it.

31:50.033 --> 31:50.909
Who?

31:51.576 --> 31:53.786
Someone who runs a business
in our buildings.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.747
A friend of the Happiness chairman.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.461
Se-young's dad said something odd
before he passed away.

32:01.544 --> 32:04.672
So, what are you imagining right now?

32:06.424 --> 32:07.884
I don't know either.

32:07.967 --> 32:12.805
I was just concerned about Kim Yong-jin
getting in the way of your business.

32:12.931 --> 32:16.893
Does Kim Yong-jin have anything to do
with  the fact that I go missing?

32:17.685 --> 32:20.688
You said things would get worse
if I tried to find out more.

32:21.814 --> 32:23.816
Kim Yong-jin is involved, doesn't it?

32:25.985 --> 32:26.986
That's right.

32:28.321 --> 32:31.824
You keep traveling back and forth on
the subway to look into Kim Yong-jin.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.159
That's when you go missing.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.037
So-joon.

32:36.579 --> 32:38.247
Tomorrow is November 30.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.961
-So...
-It could be connected to Se-young's dad.

32:43.044 --> 32:46.589
These are all just your own speculations.

32:47.048 --> 32:51.427
Even if you do something now,
what can you find out today?

32:53.721 --> 32:56.516
It's today and tomorrow.
You need to get through two days.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.937
Hold on for two days.

33:12.323 --> 33:15.326
<i>Why did you suffer that</i>
<i>at the hands of Kim Yong-jin?</i>

33:17.704 --> 33:19.998
<i>What's in that footage of his dash camera?</i>

33:24.669 --> 33:27.422
<i>Think about</i>
<i>what the most important thing to you is.</i>

33:27.964 --> 33:29.590
<i>If something were to happen to you,</i>

33:29.674 --> 33:32.051
<i>what happens to the person</i>
<i>who is depending on you?</i>

33:32.885 --> 33:36.472
<i>It's only two days, okay?</i>
<i>Stay quiet for two days.</i>

33:40.935 --> 33:42.603
Mom, I'm working.

33:42.770 --> 33:46.357
<i>When are you getting home?</i>
<i>Perhaps I shouldn't have come.</i>

33:47.108 --> 33:48.359
Are you at our place?

33:48.568 --> 33:51.529
<i>Yes, and there's a fun thing going around.</i>

33:52.405 --> 33:53.281
What?

33:53.614 --> 33:56.034
<i>I threw garbage at the vacuum.</i>

33:56.117 --> 33:58.369
It's coming over
and eating it up like a dog.

33:58.703 --> 33:59.996
-<i>Mom!</i>
-Look at that.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.915
<i>Mom, no. Get out.</i>

34:03.291 --> 34:04.792
-<i>Just get out.</i>
-Why?

34:04.959 --> 34:07.879
I told you not to come over
when nobody's home.

34:07.962 --> 34:11.507
Hey, So-joon even called me "Mom".
He's comfortable with me.

34:14.927 --> 34:17.180
Mom, don't go upstairs.
You can't go up there.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.640
<i>Upstairs is our private area.</i>

34:19.724 --> 34:21.976
Mom, just get out!

34:24.979 --> 34:27.356
Doesn't she go back and forth a lot?

34:28.441 --> 34:31.778
She's quite normal at times,
but can be very odd too.

34:33.279 --> 34:34.739
You're like that too, Se-young.

34:35.114 --> 34:35.948
What?

34:36.115 --> 34:37.992
You're great sometimes.

34:39.410 --> 34:42.288
And when I'm rude, I can be very rude?

34:46.209 --> 34:48.419
I think I'm quite friendly.

34:56.177 --> 34:59.180
What do I do?
The great secret of mankind is at stake.

35:03.518 --> 35:06.145
What's up here
that she's acting like that?

35:06.229 --> 35:08.648
Ouch. That hurt.

35:09.023 --> 35:10.525
Goodness.

35:13.152 --> 35:14.237
That hurts.

35:14.737 --> 35:16.364
What could it be?

35:16.614 --> 35:17.615
Mom!

35:20.535 --> 35:21.536
Mom!

35:24.080 --> 35:25.289
Mom!

35:26.374 --> 35:27.792
Where did she go?

35:28.376 --> 35:31.045
Seriously... Mom!

35:33.422 --> 35:34.674
Mom!

35:36.342 --> 35:37.343
Mom!

35:38.511 --> 35:40.972
I told you not to come up here.

35:42.181 --> 35:43.141
Gosh.

35:43.683 --> 35:46.644
Hey, what are all these?

35:46.894 --> 35:48.771
These sneakers wrap around my feet.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.358
These are still in development.

35:52.441 --> 35:54.735
So-joon's friend in research gave them
to him.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.946
All of these...

35:58.114 --> 36:02.076
Well... he has a lot of great connections.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.995
You have a newspaper for next year.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.831
Look. Ryu Sun-kwang
is going to get elected.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.126
This?

36:10.209 --> 36:12.795
Do rich people even get papers in advance?

36:13.629 --> 36:16.799
Is the world planned in advance
and we're just getting fooled?

36:18.843 --> 36:19.719
This is...

36:20.178 --> 36:24.223
just a prop. I'm taking pictures
with a "future" concept.

36:24.807 --> 36:30.062
So, a time traveler's wife
and a time traveler's mother-in-law.

36:30.146 --> 36:32.148
I made it like this.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.193
I thought So-joon was a spy.

36:39.947 --> 36:43.951
I guess you and I really do think alike.

36:44.076 --> 36:44.911
Really?

36:45.828 --> 36:48.372
What is this thing? A bracelet?

36:48.789 --> 36:51.334
Goodness, I was so shocked.

36:52.501 --> 36:53.878
I understand how you feel.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.131
Hey... wait.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.508
Let's talk, okay?

37:00.092 --> 37:02.136
-Come here.
-Talk about what?

37:03.012 --> 37:05.640
Sit down. I need to talk to you.

37:08.559 --> 37:09.435
What is it?

37:14.357 --> 37:16.359
So-joon came to talk to me.

37:19.278 --> 37:21.030
Why is this so hard to talk about?

37:24.242 --> 37:25.534
To look for Dad?

37:27.620 --> 37:28.496
Yeah.

37:29.956 --> 37:32.875
He says he can find him
with a resident registration number.

37:33.834 --> 37:35.962
It's not because I want to find him.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.798
I was wondering if you might want to.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.092
The resident number
is on the form.

37:43.010 --> 37:44.637
I have one picture of him, too.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.517
You said you burned them.

37:57.483 --> 38:00.027
You looked for your dad so much
when you were a kid.

38:01.153 --> 38:03.781
I thought it would be better
to make you forget quickly.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.743
I was going to show you
when you got older.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.713
I was young back then.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.425
I was younger than you are now.

38:25.177 --> 38:26.387
That's what I'm saying.

38:27.847 --> 38:30.933
A woman younger than me had a child.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.602
He threw you away and left you.

38:34.395 --> 38:35.688
Gosh.

38:36.022 --> 38:39.817
Honestly, responsibility isn't enough
to solve issues between men and women.

38:39.942 --> 38:42.945
You never showed it to me.
Why are you showing me now?

38:43.029 --> 38:45.031
Because you said you resent him.

38:45.573 --> 38:49.577
I didn't think of how it would hurt you
and I was immature.

38:50.745 --> 38:51.912
Goodness.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.583
I'm sorry
I put you through all of these things.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.087
Don't say that.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.006
What did you do wrong?

39:02.506 --> 39:05.009
I must be getting old,
saying these things.

39:05.092 --> 39:07.345
What do you mean you're old?
You're so young.

39:07.887 --> 39:11.057
Why are you pretending
to be like a mom from TV?

39:18.898 --> 39:22.735
You'll soon have kids of your own,
and you'll be a mother.

39:23.486 --> 39:26.864
You're an adult now, so find your dad.

39:28.783 --> 39:31.702
I raised you so well all on my own.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.373
I want to show off to him
about  my great son-in-law too.

39:42.505 --> 39:45.674
If I'm born again as your mom...

39:47.551 --> 39:49.804
I promise to do better.

39:56.143 --> 39:57.103
Don't cry.

40:14.495 --> 40:15.579
Ma-rin.

40:19.166 --> 40:20.334
What are you doing there?

40:23.796 --> 40:25.881
Were you crying?

40:31.053 --> 40:33.055
I remembered my dad's face.

40:35.474 --> 40:37.059
My mom gave me a picture.

40:42.690 --> 40:45.734
So, how are you feeling about it?

40:51.198 --> 40:52.199
It's weird.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.537
I thought I forgot everything.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.415
Looking at this picture...

41:00.583 --> 41:02.668
I remembered
what it felt like in the past.

41:11.218 --> 41:12.094
Thank you.

41:16.390 --> 41:17.516
Do you want to meet him?

41:18.476 --> 41:19.852
Should we find him?

41:23.481 --> 41:24.815
I'm not sure yet.

41:27.651 --> 41:28.903
What if I meet him

41:29.862 --> 41:31.864
and I'm just disappointed?

41:34.033 --> 41:37.411
What if he's someone
that is in a terrible state?

41:39.246 --> 41:41.582
What if my mom gets hurt again?

41:45.127 --> 41:47.755
Would he like it
if we went looking for him?

41:58.474 --> 42:01.727
-Do you want to see the picture?
-Yes, I'm curious.

42:07.691 --> 42:09.318
Hey, So-joon...

42:11.487 --> 42:13.739
You have to trust me.
You need to trust me.

42:13.822 --> 42:15.449
It's really that strange woman?

42:15.533 --> 42:17.326
<i>She's destined to die in an accident.</i>

42:17.409 --> 42:20.663
-I tried everything I could to help.
-<i>Why would you, Mister?</i>

42:20.788 --> 42:22.540
<i>Why would you help people around me?</i>

42:22.623 --> 42:24.708
It's because I feel like you're my son.

42:27.878 --> 42:29.213
She was my daughter.

42:30.589 --> 42:32.007
<i>She was my daughter.</i>

42:33.842 --> 42:34.718
What is it?

42:35.427 --> 42:36.595
This man...

42:37.513 --> 42:39.139
is your father, right?

42:47.731 --> 42:50.526
I'm going to go get some air.

42:55.531 --> 42:56.824
Let's go together.

43:00.327 --> 43:02.580
I can barely remember my days as Bap-soon.

43:04.123 --> 43:08.711
I was just a big ball
of inferiority complexes.

43:09.461 --> 43:12.339
I had always thought
my life was a failure.

43:13.507 --> 43:15.509
I felt I was Bap-soon,
no matter what I did.

43:17.469 --> 43:20.139
I thought I would never get out of there.

43:22.558 --> 43:26.729
After meeting you,
I feel like my life is in order.

43:28.897 --> 43:30.983
I feel like I'm really living now.

43:32.943 --> 43:33.902
Yeah.

43:34.903 --> 43:36.405
Let's lead a good life together.

43:37.823 --> 43:38.991
We really should.

43:40.117 --> 43:42.036
Let's lead a good life.

43:47.291 --> 43:49.627
I have a confession to make.

43:51.128 --> 43:52.087
What?

43:53.631 --> 43:54.757
To tell you the truth...

43:57.885 --> 44:00.179
you and I were not meant to meet.

44:03.098 --> 44:04.350
What do you mean by that?

44:06.226 --> 44:07.895
You weren't a part of my future.

44:09.355 --> 44:10.356
We weren't...

44:11.190 --> 44:14.109
supposed to even date,
let alone get married.

44:17.237 --> 44:21.200
Then someone told me to try dating you.

44:23.661 --> 44:24.787
Who?

44:26.080 --> 44:27.289
A man I know.

44:27.873 --> 44:30.918
I mentioned before
that there's someone else like me.

44:32.127 --> 44:34.129
Another man who rides the subway?

44:35.422 --> 44:38.092
That man who was sharing the umbrella
with you before?

44:39.093 --> 44:41.345
-Yes.
-How does he know me?

44:41.679 --> 44:42.763
I don't know.

44:43.847 --> 44:45.516
Let's meet him together and ask him.

44:46.183 --> 44:47.935
It might seem strange at first,

44:48.394 --> 44:50.270
but I'm sure you'll get to like him too.

44:53.107 --> 44:54.775
I'm not sure what you're saying.

44:55.776 --> 44:58.904
So, we weren't destined to meet.

44:59.446 --> 45:01.824
You're saying we met because of him.
Is that it?

45:02.074 --> 45:06.370
Yes. It was my choice after that.

45:07.496 --> 45:10.040
So I wasn't fated to meet you?

45:11.625 --> 45:12.543
No.

45:14.128 --> 45:15.295
We changed it.

45:20.342 --> 45:23.554
I don't really know what fate is.

45:24.805 --> 45:26.432
Isn't this what fate is?

45:30.060 --> 45:33.605
Let's go meet him tomorrow.

45:36.984 --> 45:38.068
Okay.

45:39.194 --> 45:41.530
Oh, before we do...

45:43.115 --> 45:44.533
let's go register our marriage.

45:46.827 --> 45:49.747
How long are we going to delay it?
Are you still testing it out?

45:51.039 --> 45:51.957
No.

45:52.207 --> 45:54.960
Then we'll go register our marriage
tomorrow.

45:56.545 --> 45:58.297
I want to marry you for real.

45:59.882 --> 46:01.258
Will you marry me?

46:03.552 --> 46:04.428
Yes.

46:05.679 --> 46:07.097
Let's get married for real.

46:14.271 --> 46:16.398
Let's walk around once more
and go back inside.

46:17.316 --> 46:18.233
Yes.

46:19.151 --> 46:22.905
-We're really getting married tomorrow.
-We're getting married.

46:23.864 --> 46:25.157
Officially, this time.

46:39.296 --> 46:40.297
What is this?

46:56.688 --> 46:57.606
What now?

46:58.774 --> 47:01.527
Lee Gun-sook,
you really don't listen to me, do you?

47:02.402 --> 47:05.531
-I told you to go to your parents'--
-You want my mom to faint?

47:08.075 --> 47:09.368
Why are you here?

47:09.868 --> 47:11.495
What if your creditors find you?

47:15.207 --> 47:18.418
You touched my dash camera, didn't you?

47:19.503 --> 47:21.713
No. Why would I?

47:22.297 --> 47:25.050
Stop playing around,
and give me the memory card.

47:26.218 --> 47:28.262
You took it out. Where is it?
Give it to me.

47:28.345 --> 47:29.221
I don't know.

47:32.724 --> 47:34.977
What are you talking about? You took it.

47:35.060 --> 47:36.770
I wanted to see what you were up to.

47:38.230 --> 47:40.566
I'm going to use it as evidence.
Do you understand?

47:40.649 --> 47:42.651
I'm not leaving.
I'm getting a divorce.

47:43.110 --> 47:45.112
-Stop with the nonsense.
-Nonsense?

47:45.696 --> 47:47.781
Stop the damned nonsense
and bring it to me.

47:49.074 --> 47:50.659
-Where's your friend's house?
-What?

47:50.742 --> 47:52.953
It's not here.
I already entrusted it to someone.

47:53.996 --> 47:55.330
I left it with Ma-rin.

47:58.333 --> 48:00.335
What were you thinking? Are you insane?

48:00.919 --> 48:01.962
Song Ma-rin?

48:02.963 --> 48:06.383
-Yes.
-Why would you leave it with her?

48:07.885 --> 48:09.094
Yong-jin..

48:09.595 --> 48:11.346
You must be totally crazy.

48:12.931 --> 48:13.807
Hey!

48:14.641 --> 48:16.310
-Stop it.
-Why would you do that!

48:16.643 --> 48:19.021
That doesn't belong to you!

48:19.104 --> 48:20.480
Stop it. Stop it, please.

48:20.564 --> 48:23.191
Why did you give it to her?

48:23.275 --> 48:24.151
Yong-jin.

48:26.695 --> 48:29.448
Gun-sook, why are you doing this?

48:31.742 --> 48:34.870
NOVEMBER 30, 2016

48:35.287 --> 48:36.622
-Hello.
-<i>Hey.</i>

48:36.747 --> 48:38.916
<i>What did you do with</i>
<i>Gun-sook's dash camera?</i>

48:39.249 --> 48:41.251
I'm on my way to pick it up now.

48:41.376 --> 48:43.378
<i>I don't think you should get involved.</i>

48:44.713 --> 48:46.965
Gun-sook's husband came by yesterday.

48:50.177 --> 48:52.137
He was demanding
she hand over the camera.

48:52.638 --> 48:54.431
He was screaming his head off.

48:55.057 --> 48:57.559
<i>I was scared for my life.</i>

48:57.643 --> 48:58.477
Really?

48:59.394 --> 49:02.356
<i>I really think</i>
<i>Gun-sook needs to divorce him.</i>

49:02.606 --> 49:04.441
<i>He's a total psycho.</i>

49:05.150 --> 49:07.527
<i>I was about to call the police.</i>

49:09.488 --> 49:13.158
Don't tell Gun-sook anything for now.

49:13.784 --> 49:16.286
-I'll call you in the afternoon.
-<i>What are you planning?</i>

49:17.287 --> 49:18.580
I'll take care of it.

49:25.420 --> 49:26.713
I feel nervous.

49:38.100 --> 49:39.768
Where did Ma-rin go?

49:44.898 --> 49:46.525
<i>I'll be out for just a moment.</i>

49:47.192 --> 49:50.862
<i>We're registering our marriage today.</i>
<i>And then...</i>

49:51.238 --> 49:53.615
<i>Let's go meet the man who helped us meet.</i>

49:53.991 --> 49:55.033
<i>I love you.</i>

49:59.621 --> 50:00.622
Is it Ma-rin?

50:08.130 --> 50:10.465
I was going to call you.

50:12.259 --> 50:13.218
Out front?

50:16.596 --> 50:19.766
So-joon, I have something urgent
I need to tell you.

50:19.850 --> 50:21.226
Let me go first.

50:23.145 --> 50:25.731
I found out who you are, Mister.

50:27.524 --> 50:29.276
What do you mean?

50:29.609 --> 50:31.111
I know why you helped me.

50:32.070 --> 50:35.490
I know now why you said
I'm like a son to you.

50:37.075 --> 50:39.995
Ma-rin really wants to see her dad.

50:42.289 --> 50:44.124
How did you know?

50:45.250 --> 50:48.795
How did you hold back
when I was being so rude all those times?

50:52.007 --> 50:54.009
-Why did you hide it--
-So-joon!

50:54.134 --> 50:56.261
Well, let's put that aside

50:56.344 --> 50:57.804
and talk about it later.

50:58.180 --> 51:00.557
I have something very urgent to tell you.

51:02.100 --> 51:04.519
Yesterday, I met Ma-rin.

51:06.313 --> 51:07.355
-What?
-Well...

51:07.439 --> 51:09.983
The only person
who knows the secret about Kim Yong-jin.

51:10.275 --> 51:12.277
The only person
who I could ask was Ma-rin.

51:12.360 --> 51:13.612
What do you mean?

51:24.247 --> 51:25.165
Hey...

51:28.251 --> 51:30.879
Do you know who I am?

51:35.133 --> 51:36.093
Yes.

51:37.260 --> 51:38.512
I've seen your picture.

51:41.264 --> 51:44.643
I'm sorry to show up so suddenly.

51:45.143 --> 51:47.896
This is just very surprising.

51:49.064 --> 51:51.691
-I need some time to think.
-I'm from the past.

51:53.527 --> 51:55.112
I came to help you two.

51:56.071 --> 51:57.697
I came to save So-joon.

51:59.324 --> 52:01.868
I'm from November 29, 2016.

52:02.911 --> 52:04.287
There's only a day left.

52:06.498 --> 52:11.336
That day, what happened to you two?

52:13.088 --> 52:16.675
I didn't want to ask you about it.

52:18.385 --> 52:19.553
I have no other way.

52:23.390 --> 52:24.391
Come in.

52:31.273 --> 52:35.443
It makes sense that there's no evidence
against Kim Yong-jin.

52:38.071 --> 52:40.365
Because So-joon was a time traveler.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.784
The investigation was confidential.

52:44.035 --> 52:47.873
Then what happened to Kim Yong-jin?

52:50.750 --> 52:52.752
I know he fled to Vietnam.

52:54.629 --> 52:56.965
I heard he got away with
tens of billions won.

52:58.049 --> 52:59.384
I'm sure he's living well.

52:59.551 --> 53:04.055
Can you tell me the details
of what happened that day?

53:04.139 --> 53:05.140
What happened?

53:09.519 --> 53:14.065
I had the memory card
of Kim Yong-jin's dash camera.

53:15.483 --> 53:18.778
No one knows what was on there.

53:19.905 --> 53:23.533
Before we could even check,
Kim Yong-jin took it from us.

53:27.120 --> 53:31.917
There was his crime of kidnapping me
and of embezzlement.

53:33.084 --> 53:34.252
As for murder...

53:35.462 --> 53:37.088
we couldn't find anything.

53:37.297 --> 53:39.007
He kidnapped you?

53:40.175 --> 53:42.677
You had the evidence?

53:44.554 --> 53:45.388
Yes.

53:47.432 --> 53:51.478
I didn't even know that this whole time.
How stupid of me.

53:54.439 --> 53:55.398
Well...

53:59.527 --> 54:02.781
It's almost time for the subway to close.

54:03.531 --> 54:04.658
I'll get going now.

54:05.283 --> 54:06.785
Please stop it from happening.

54:08.495 --> 54:10.622
Stop So-joon from getting on the subway.

54:11.498 --> 54:13.333
Stop me from doing something stupid.

54:14.751 --> 54:16.628
Okay. Don't worry.

54:16.920 --> 54:18.338
I'll go and stop it.

54:19.089 --> 54:19.923
I'll get going.

54:20.507 --> 54:21.508
Wait.

54:24.719 --> 54:26.346
The person

54:27.305 --> 54:29.015
who made So-joon and I meet...

54:30.350 --> 54:31.810
Was it you, Dad?

54:33.895 --> 54:35.355
Yes.

54:37.732 --> 54:39.484
Please meet with me when you go back.

54:41.361 --> 54:42.946
I think I missed you.

54:52.372 --> 54:53.623
Okay.

54:54.666 --> 54:57.252
Bye then.
I'll be going. The subway will close.

55:00.380 --> 55:01.423
Go inside.

55:14.269 --> 55:17.439
All I knew was that you were hurt
by Kim Yong-jin in the subway.

55:17.522 --> 55:19.941
I assumed it was you
who knew Kim Yong-jin's secret.

55:20.025 --> 55:22.485
That's why I stopped you
from getting involved.

55:23.862 --> 55:26.197
I never imagined
Ma-rin would have the evidence.

55:26.990 --> 55:29.159
So, go inside now.

55:29.242 --> 55:31.953
You need to make sure
Ma-rin doesn't get involved in this.

55:32.037 --> 55:33.330
She's not home right now.

55:34.748 --> 55:35.749
What?

55:50.889 --> 55:52.640
-Has the data been recovered?
-Yes.

55:53.350 --> 55:54.642
But this is...

55:58.271 --> 55:59.356
Never mind.

56:03.151 --> 56:04.319
Thank you.

56:10.283 --> 56:12.702
CALLING TO FLOWER

56:17.082 --> 56:19.834
<i>I never imagined</i>
<i>Ma-rin would have the evidence.</i>

56:23.254 --> 56:24.881
<i>He takes that evidence from her.</i>

56:26.007 --> 56:27.300
Get up!

56:28.218 --> 56:30.637
<i>He uses Ma-rin as bait</i>
<i>to get you to come out.</i>

56:40.563 --> 56:41.398
Ma-rin!

56:44.818 --> 56:47.362
Has Song Ma-rin been in here?

57:17.642 --> 57:18.852
What's going on?

57:20.103 --> 57:22.105
Just stay still.

57:29.279 --> 57:33.116
-How did you know that I'd be here?
-Ma-rin, are you okay?

57:33.908 --> 57:34.951
Did something happen?

57:35.785 --> 57:38.746
What about Kim Yong-jin?
Have you seen him?

57:39.038 --> 57:40.123
Kim Yong-jin?

57:41.166 --> 57:42.459
No, I haven't seen him.

57:46.713 --> 57:48.047
Are you here because of this?

57:49.674 --> 57:51.926
Why would you get involved
in something like this?

57:53.136 --> 57:54.846
You could have told me beforehand.

57:54.971 --> 57:58.433
-Why are you so fearless?
-Is there something filmed on here?

57:58.558 --> 58:01.769
I just wanted to help Gun-sook
because she's been so stressed out.

58:01.853 --> 58:02.896
Let's just go.

58:04.230 --> 58:05.482
Where are we going?

58:21.039 --> 58:22.165
Where are you going?

58:31.257 --> 58:33.927
Tell me. What's on that thing?

58:34.010 --> 58:37.180
Go straight home.
You can't go anywhere else, okay?

58:37.388 --> 58:40.141
Lock up when you get home.
Don't open the door for anyone.

58:41.184 --> 58:42.018
Okay, I got it.

58:42.101 --> 58:44.437
Turn on your phone
and call me when you get home.

59:03.414 --> 59:05.458
<i>The number you have dialed...</i>

59:05.542 --> 59:06.417
Damn!

59:07.085 --> 59:08.169
Kim Yong-jin!

59:09.128 --> 59:10.588
Kim Yong-jin, where are you?

59:11.464 --> 59:12.549
Kim Yong-jin!

59:29.857 --> 59:31.150
How have you been?

1:00:09.439 --> 1:00:10.273
Were you too late?

1:00:10.356 --> 1:00:14.193
Your wife will freeze to death.
She will die!

1:00:14.277 --> 1:00:15.236
Where are you?

1:00:15.820 --> 1:00:17.864
<i>You're Ma-rin's father.</i>

1:00:18.906 --> 1:00:21.784
<i>I won't repeat the same mistakes again.</i>

1:00:21.868 --> 1:00:24.495
<i>So-joon won't come.</i>

1:00:25.038 --> 1:00:27.373
<i>You said you knew everything.</i>

1:00:27.457 --> 1:00:30.293
<i>Why didn't you help So-joon? Why?</i>

1:00:31.044 --> 1:00:33.963
<i>I'll cherish my memories with you.</i>

1:00:34.964 --> 1:00:37.383
<i>I'll dream of the moment we meet again.</i>

1:00:37.967 --> 1:00:39.636
<i>I'll be waiting for you right here.</i>

1:00:41.220 --> 1:00:42.430
<i>I love you.</i>

1:00:43.473 --> 1:00:45.475
