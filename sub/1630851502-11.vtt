19:05.612 --> 19:07.778
- Wally, oh my god.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.714
I thought all
our class was dead.

19:09.749 --> 19:12.016
[laughter]

19:12.051 --> 19:14.619
- so this is a very
exciting day for our city.

19:14.654 --> 19:18.456
We get to welcome
our hometown hero,

19:18.491 --> 19:20.158
mr. Terry bradshaw back.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.160
[applause]

19:22.195 --> 19:26.197
he was the first player
selected into 1970 nfl draft,

19:26.232 --> 19:27.565
led the pittsburgh steelers

19:27.600 --> 19:30.201
to eight afc central
championships

19:30.236 --> 19:33.004
and four super bowl titles.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.039
[applause]

19:35.074 --> 19:36.574
at this time,
I would like to present

19:36.609 --> 19:39.277
terry bradshaw
with the key of the city.

19:39.312 --> 19:43.047
[cheers and applause]

19:43.082 --> 19:44.482
- thank you, mayor.
Appreciate it.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.716
- Thank you so much
for coming back to us.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.019
- Thank you.
And I thank the city.

19:48.054 --> 19:52.857
I thank my family, especially
zurie, little granddaughter.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.025
'cause I told her when
we walked out here, I said,

19:54.060 --> 19:57.195
"you didn't think I was
such a big thing, did you?"

19:57.230 --> 19:59.697
and she said, "no." she didn't.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.500
Anyway, this caught me
totally off guard,

20:02.535 --> 20:05.403
and I'm not a man
that likes to look back,

20:05.438 --> 20:08.573
but I do love this city.
I always have.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.308
This is where
it started for me.

20:10.343 --> 20:13.844
<i> Being back in shreveport makes</i>
<i> me realize how blessed I am.</i>

20:13.880 --> 20:16.681
It's been just an awesome day.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.616
Thank you all for coming.

20:18.651 --> 20:22.320
What a great honor for me
and all my teammates, coaches.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.055
Thank you all.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.757
[cheers and applause]

20:28.294 --> 20:30.261
- I'm so proud of dad.
- I'm so proud of dad.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.897
- I couldn't be more proud
to call him my dad.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.932
It's humbling to be raised
by someone

20:34.968 --> 20:38.703
that is where they're at now
but had to work to get there.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.773
- It's just really special to
see kind of where he came from.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.575
- Thanks so much. Again.
- Thank you, mayor.

20:44.611 --> 20:45.776
- Yeah, no problem.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.913
- I'm really proud of you, dad.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.985
- I got something for you.
- Okay. Let's see it.

20:56.389 --> 20:59.523
- We're going around and doing
random acts of kindness.

20:59.559 --> 21:00.791
- Hi.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.727
- We want to pay
for everyone's lunch.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.061
Thank you so much.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.429
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

21:05.465 --> 21:06.597
- Thank you.
- Okay, you too.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.798
- All right. Love you.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.134
I just told that guy
that I love him.

21:10.169 --> 21:11.669
- I can't believe it.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.838
- I won an auction to get
to spend the day with you.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.073
Can I have one of these?
Amazing.
