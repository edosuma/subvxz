01:45.040 --> 01:47.679
(Girl) Higher...

01:47.800 --> 01:51.509
(Charlie) I can't, sweetheart.
Any higher, you're gonna hit the moon.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.471
And get a bump?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.673
(Laughs) That's right, smart girl,
and get a bump!

02:12.960 --> 02:16.794
Oh, hey! Emily, look who it is.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.388
- Hi, Isabella.
- Hi, Emilita.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.239
- There we go... Hi, how are you?
- Hey, great.

02:22.360 --> 02:26.148
Ok, I've got her lunch,
an extra Thermos of apple juice,

02:26.280 --> 02:29.670
her Elmo doll, Mr Frizzles,
12 grapes in a bag...

02:29.800 --> 02:32.439
I got it, Mr Wood.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.199
- Thanks. I'll see you at 5:00.
- OK.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.676
All right, sweetheart. Come here.
High five...

03:00.720 --> 03:02.517
(Door shuts)

03:02.640 --> 03:05.677
First the Wyoming Widow,
now the Oregon Undertaker.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.394
They just pulled a dead girl
out of the reservoir.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.317
God! Suicide?

03:10.440 --> 03:15.355
If she chopped off her own arms and
legs before strangling herself, maybe.

03:15.480 --> 03:19.155
- Pen, I'm eating.
- They figure it's the Oregon Undertaker.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.430
That's the fourth girl in six months.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.835
Each one mutilated
and disembowelled...

03:23.960 --> 03:27.316
- Pen! Pen!
- Oh, sorry baby.

03:28.480 --> 03:32.712
Listen, Charlie. You don't
have to do this, you know.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.400
Course I do. We can't go on
living on one income.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.273
How many times have you
given Emily SpaghettiOs?

03:38.400 --> 03:40.391
She likes SpaghettiOs.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.398
Hey, baby. Trust me.
Once they buy your book...

03:44.520 --> 03:48.354
Not a single publisher has called, Pen.
Not a single one.

...Melanie speaking. How can I help?

04:26.440 --> 04:28.795
Again, my name is Melanie.
Have a great day.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.957
Do you only hire women
named Melanie?

04:32.080 --> 04:36.710
It's a trick of the trade. Callers like
to think they get the same service rep.

04:36.840 --> 04:39.957
This here is the Melanie
and John section,

04:40.080 --> 04:43.197
and you are over here
with the Jennifers and Stephens.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.550
This is you.

04:47.720 --> 04:51.190
What do you mean this is me?
I was told I had a supervisor position.

04:51.320 --> 04:56.110
(Laughs) You gotta spend six months
in the trenches

04:56.240 --> 04:59.471
before you can interview
for a supervisor.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.909
But I have a PhD.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.589
- Surely...
- Look. You want the job or not?

05:07.360 --> 05:09.635
- Yeah.
- Great!

05:09.760 --> 05:11.796
Gus here will help get you started.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.673
- OK, Stephen.
- It's Charlie.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.791
(Laughs) Sure it is!

05:16.920 --> 05:20.230
In the File menu do you see
where it says Open?

05:20.360 --> 05:24.114
Okey-dokey. Can you open
the Open menu?

05:26.440 --> 05:32.549
Okey-dokey. Again, my name is
Stephen. Thank you for calling Sentel.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.148
(Charlie) 'I actually liked Gus
at first sight.'

05:35.280 --> 05:38.636
- Welcome to hell, dickhead!
- (Charlie) 'Maybe not at first.'

05:38.760 --> 05:40.830
- I'm sorry?
- Hell!

05:40.960 --> 05:43.394
People hooked up to machines
like slaves.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.910
And the smell...
It's pure underarm.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.511
- OK, so what do we do here?
- (Phone beeps)

05:54.560 --> 05:57.552
Sentel Online, Stephen speaking.
How may I help you?

05:58.560 --> 06:01.552
Okey-dokey, ma'am. Have you
checked to see if your PC is on?

06:04.240 --> 06:06.993
No, I'm not a retard.
That's simply the protocol...

06:07.120 --> 06:08.838
Sorry.

06:09.840 --> 06:13.310
Okey-dokey. I'm gonna check that
with my supervisor real quick

06:13.440 --> 06:15.078
and I'm gonna put you on hold.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.872
You feel feisty, you whiney
little turkey-necked bitch?

06:19.000 --> 06:23.312
Why don't you hop up on my dick
and see if that fires your monitor?

06:25.080 --> 06:26.877
Hello, ma'am. Thanks for waiting.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.310
I'm gonna transfer you over to our
technical service department.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.238
Okey-dokey? Please hold...

06:36.360 --> 06:39.193
In the kingdom of the blind,
the one-eyed dwarf is king!

06:41.240 --> 06:44.038
That's my wife, Stephanie.
Ex-wife! Keep forgetting!

06:44.160 --> 06:47.835
And that there is my little daughter,
Thais.

06:47.960 --> 06:51.589
- That's a pretty name.
- Yeah, it's Greek. It means 'Beloved'.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.393
Thais has this problem
with her eye pressure

06:54.520 --> 06:57.876
and the doctor said if she doesn't get
a cornea transplant in a year

06:58.000 --> 07:00.594
then she's gonna go blind.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.951
Every year, 65,000 diabetics

07:08.080 --> 07:10.833
develop Proliferative Retinopathy,

07:10.960 --> 07:13.190
one of the leading precursors
to blindness.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.951
She's not diabetic.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.310
Ahem! So, are you gonna be able
to afford the surgery before she...

07:24.680 --> 07:29.037
Yeah, I hope so. If everything,
you know, goes as expected.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.151
- What do you mean?
- Huh?

07:34.160 --> 07:36.276
(Whispers) I have a plan.

07:37.240 --> 07:40.038
- (Klaxon blares)
- Oh, hells bells!

07:43.240 --> 07:47.552
(Woman over phone) 'You see,
Stephen, I'm 65 years old now

07:47.680 --> 07:51.468
'and my husband is asking me to do it
donkey-style... '

07:51.600 --> 07:57.835
OK, ma'am. I'm going to transfer you to
our technical department. Please hold...

07:58.760 --> 08:00.876
- Good god...
- Are you expecting a call?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.991
(Phone beeps)

08:04.080 --> 08:07.868
Sentel Online, this is Charlie, er...
Stephen. How can I help you?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.276
(Man over phone)
'Yeah, my IP Address is stuck on 169.'

08:11.400 --> 08:16.474
OK, Sir. Have you checked
to make sure your computer is on?

08:16.600 --> 08:19.319
- (Man) 'Didn't you hear what I said? '
- Yes.

08:19.440 --> 08:22.989
Oh, IP Address. IP Address...

08:23.120 --> 08:27.511
Here we go. Your IP Address
should start with 81.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.108
So... does it?

08:30.240 --> 08:34.950
(Man) 'I told you it was stuck on 169!
Do the cleaners answer the phones?

08:35.080 --> 08:37.275
- Sir...
- (Man) 'No, don't sir me, asshole!

08:37.400 --> 08:40.278
'Just help me out
with my fucking problem! '

08:40.400 --> 08:43.836
Please hold on while I check
with our technical department.

08:43.960 --> 08:48.909
Yes, sir. Your wife is one
of 3.8 percent of American women

08:49.040 --> 08:54.398
who engage in online chats with a
stranger, accompanied by masturbation.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.630
(Man) 'My wife died three months ago.

08:59.760 --> 09:03.548
'But I'd like to discuss that
with your supervisor, Stephen.'

09:19.560 --> 09:22.358
Hey! Charlie, wait. Wait!

09:22.480 --> 09:25.631
- It's my fault.
- Don't worry about it. I'll be all right.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.718
- Look, you know I said I had a plan?
- Yep.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.991
Well, why don't you come in on it
with me?

09:32.120 --> 09:34.998
You know, be like a partner
or something?

09:35.120 --> 09:37.111
I sure as hell feel like I owe you one.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.191
- It's not illegal, is it?
- What? No...

09:40.320 --> 09:42.834
- Dickinson!
- Yeah. Right.

09:42.960 --> 09:46.669
Look, meet me at the Monkey Wrench,
nine o'clock. OK? Yeah.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.553
(# HOWE GELB: "But I Did Not")

09:53.280 --> 09:57.512
# Would I be awakened
where the wrong side renders?

09:57.640 --> 09:59.915
# But I did not

10:00.040 --> 10:03.237
# Would I be a dangling toward demise?

10:03.360 --> 10:05.794
# But I did not

10:05.920 --> 10:09.469
# Forgetting about
the innocent splendours?

10:09.600 --> 10:12.034
# But I did not

into deception... #

10:22.240 --> 10:24.629
Choo-choo Charlie!

10:24.760 --> 10:29.072
Hey, Max. Two bottles of your finest
mass-produced lager, if you please.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.509
- So?
- Come here.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.717
So, I stumbled across the database
at work.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.037
The online history of each
and every member of Sentel Online.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.197
Look, this is their record of everyone
in the state

10:46.320 --> 10:50.916
that went online in the last three months
and logged on to an illegal porn site.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.713
Now I figure there's gotta be
somebody in here

10:53.840 --> 10:57.037
willing to fork over some coin
to keep things hush-hush.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.469
- They all look the same
- And yet they're not.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.632
- R-E-V Neville Smalls. What's R-E-V?
- Reverend.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.309
Exactly! It's brilliant, don't you think?

11:18.440 --> 11:23.309
- I don't think I'm criminal material...
- Wait, wait!

11:25.360 --> 11:27.590
We're talking about a man of the cloth

11:27.720 --> 11:30.154
who likes to watch teenagers
take off their clothes

11:30.280 --> 11:33.078
and have god-knows-who
do god-knows-what to them!

11:33.200 --> 11:34.792
Who's the real criminal here?

11:36.400 --> 11:40.473
I tried to do things by the book, the
nine to five. You know where it got me?

11:40.600 --> 11:43.797
My daughter is about to go blind,
Charlie. Blind!

11:48.400 --> 11:50.789
- How much?
- 50 for me, 50 for you. Even hundred.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.309
A hundred?

11:54.040 --> 11:56.395
(Yells) Thousand?

11:57.600 --> 12:01.149
- (Whispers) Dollars?
- Not much to preserve one's reputation.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.875
- What if somebody gets hurt?
- It's a non-violent enterprise.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.755
No harm done whatsoever. Pretty
much all I need is for you to be my alibi.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.678
- That's all?
- That's all.

12:13.720 --> 12:14.994
OK...

12:23.320 --> 12:25.834
Pick the blue one
and you go back to your old life.

12:25.960 --> 12:29.555
But pick the red one
and you finally get to be a free man.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.552
But, I must warn you, once you eat
the red one... there's no turning back.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.590
Yes! I gotta tell you,
I was a little nervous about going solo.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.759
OK. Rule number one -
preparation is king.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.190
More than anything else,
we wanna rule out the element of...

12:58.320 --> 13:00.276
- (Yells) Surprise!
- Jeez!

13:00.400 --> 13:02.391
Josie, how long were you sitting there?

13:02.520 --> 13:06.069
Long enough to ask how you'd feel
about bringing in a third.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.316
Oh...

13:08.440 --> 13:11.750
(Charlie) 'Here's the touching story
of how Gus met Josie.'

13:16.640 --> 13:18.437
Er... miss.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.634
- Yes, sir?
- I'm gonna get the cheque.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.718
- Why?
- Does the chef have curly hair?

13:26.840 --> 13:30.276
- No.
- I'm gonna get the cheque.

13:32.200 --> 13:36.193
- You work at the call centre, huh?
- Yeah, how can you tell?

13:36.320 --> 13:38.470
- Well, half the town does.
- Right.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.036
- You have that look the rest of them do.
- What look is that?

13:42.160 --> 13:47.188
That how much longer till I drop dead
so I don't have to go to my stupid job!

13:47.320 --> 13:50.551
- That look.
- Yeah, that would be the one.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.950
- You from here?
- Nope. Oklahoma.

13:54.080 --> 13:59.313
- Oh, Oklahoma. What's that like?
- Nowhere near as sexy as you.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.678
- Ahem!
- I'll get that.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.149
So, care to hear about
our desert special?

14:12.280 --> 14:17.513
Wow! Jeez! You sure are a very
forthright and smart girl, ain't ya?

14:17.640 --> 14:21.918
That's what they said last year when
they crowned me Miss Teen Oklahoma.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.508
- What?
- What?

14:24.640 --> 14:28.599
- Miss Teen Oklahoma? Last year?
- Yeah.

14:28.720 --> 14:32.872
- How old are you?
- 18... more or less.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.833
Is it more or is it less?

14:35.960 --> 14:38.155
Well... less, I guess!

14:39.840 --> 14:41.831
Shit!

14:41.960 --> 14:45.236
- What the hell's matter with you?
- You're a child!

14:45.360 --> 14:49.069
Do I look like a child? Huh?

14:49.200 --> 14:52.510
OK... Ah! Is there anything else
you forgot to mention?

15:02.240 --> 15:05.152
- Who are you?
- Charlie Wood, Gus's former co-worker.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.874
Josie McBroom.
Gus and I were an item.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.592
- Ha!
- What?

15:09.720 --> 15:13.076
- I'm sorry to interrupt, but what...
- I want in.

15:15.320 --> 15:19.393
All right, read my lips, OK -
no f... g way!

15:19.520 --> 15:21.795
- You guys can't do the job without me?
- Why?

15:21.920 --> 15:24.878
Because, dumb-dumb, I'm the only one
who can make the call.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.151
If the preacher records you
on his answer machine

15:28.280 --> 15:32.319
they'll try and match it up with
the voice records from the call centre.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.238
You guy's would be screwed,
stuffed and mounted.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.590
- Is that true?
- Kinda.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.790
How'd you work that out?

15:40.920 --> 15:43.639
I told you, I was Miss Teen Oklahoma.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.717
- How much do you want?
- 20,000.

15:47.840 --> 15:51.549
20,000? For making a phone call?

15:51.680 --> 15:54.513
For making 'the' phone call.

(Charlie) 'The average person makes
about 1,140 phone calls each year,

16:04.680 --> 16:07.672
'none of which go anything like this.'

16:07.800 --> 16:10.633
May I speak to the Reverend Smalls,
please?

16:15.880 --> 16:19.998
Hi, Reverend. Are you familiar
with a website that goes by the name of

16:20.120 --> 16:24.910
teen orgies dot com,
or young and hung dot com?

16:26.560 --> 16:30.189
Someone who knows what the mouse
plays when the wife's away.

16:32.080 --> 16:36.278
Listen, sicko. I have a list of all your
favourite sites, your credit card number,

16:36.400 --> 16:40.439
dates and times of all your connections,
so you better cut the crap!

16:44.720 --> 16:47.871
- What do I want?
- (Whispers) 100,000 dollars.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.635
(Whispers) 100,000 dollars.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.716
- 200,000.
- (Both whisper) What?

16:55.840 --> 16:59.310
You heard me,
I want 200,000 dollars, cash.

17:00.560 --> 17:04.108
Take it or leave it. But if I don't have
my money by tomorrow evening,

17:04.240 --> 17:06.800
the next church newsletter
is gonna be a doozy!

17:12.440 --> 17:14.431
And I'll be sending somebody.

17:15.520 --> 17:19.512
Well, I think that somebody deserves
to made a full partner, don't you?

17:20.880 --> 17:22.915
Wait! I took a chance and it worked.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.395
Now we each get 70,000 dollars.

17:25.520 --> 17:29.798
It's actually 66,666,
followed by an infinite number of sixes.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.512
Thanks, Rain Man!

17:31.640 --> 17:36.509
From now on, anybody pulls
any out-of-the-blue stunts, she's out!

17:36.640 --> 17:39.234
If we're partners,
let's start acting like it.

17:39.360 --> 17:43.638
This is the plan - I go get the money
at 9:00pm tomorrow.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.399
'At the same time,
Charlie enters the Monkey Wrench

17:46.520 --> 17:49.273

out of gas on the road to Mill Creek.'

He also says that I'm on my way
to the gas station,

17:52.240 --> 17:54.196
the one that opens 24/7, don't forget.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.756
10:00pm, after I stash the money
in a locker at the railway station,

17:57.880 --> 18:01.077
I come back and tell everyone
about my walk in the dark.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.510
If it comes up, Charlie was at the bar,
I was at the gas station.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.949
The guy at the station
will say he never saw you.

18:07.080 --> 18:11.039
- Sure. You why? Cos he's blind.
- Oh, pretty brill!

18:11.160 --> 18:13.276
The following day we meet at noon,

18:13.400 --> 18:15.834
we divvy up the money
and go our respective ways.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.428
OK, now. Any questions?

18:18.560 --> 18:21.313
Why don't we just divvy up
the money immediately?

18:21.440 --> 18:24.318
Rule number two -
always let the dust settle after a job.

18:24.440 --> 18:28.479
"Rule number two?" What, you've been
reading 'Blackmailing for Dummies'?

18:29.480 --> 18:31.471
Any questions? Great.

18:31.600 --> 18:35.991

happens... always stick to the plan.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.476
- Yep.
- Is she pretty?

19:19.600 --> 19:24.390
(Laughs) Pretty?
Er... no, she's more nondescript.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.472
no leads, no fingerprints, nothing.

19:53.600 --> 19:57.673
Honestly, why some folks suddenly
have to turn into criminals is beyond me.

- What if you did what?

20:06.120 --> 20:08.270

20:08.400 --> 20:12.632

20:12.760 --> 20:14.910
I'd arrest you.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.877
(Laughs)

20:21.800 --> 20:26.351
But let's say...
let's say I had to.

20:26.480 --> 20:32.191
Like we had no other choice
and I had to steal something, er...

20:32.320 --> 20:34.914
because I had to. What then?

20:35.040 --> 20:36.792
I'd arrest you.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.952
- Why?
- A good cop always gets her man!

20:41.080 --> 20:43.071
No... l'm serious, Pen.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.872
Why...

- This was no accident.

in the head

That's a hard pill to swallow.
Murder always is.

32:17.040 --> 32:20.715
I'm sorry. Are you certain
that it's the Reverend Smalls?

32:20.840 --> 32:23.274
- Oh yeah. We've got a positive ID.
- Then who's...

32:24.160 --> 32:26.469
Who's what?

32:26.600 --> 32:29.956
Who is... safe

32:30.080 --> 32:32.116
in this godforsaken world...

32:32.240 --> 32:34.595
- You family?
- Yeah... No!

32:34.720 --> 32:38.429
Just a friend. A family friend.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.676
- And your name is?
- Stephen.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.797
Stephen Hawking.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.309
Mind if I...

32:51.360 --> 32:53.157
(Sighs)

33:03.160 --> 33:07.119
- You're watching a DVD, huh?
- Yeah... No!

33:07.240 --> 33:10.312
I mean... did you know that DVD sales

33:10.440 --> 33:15.309
have risen by 226 percent
over the last six months?

33:15.440 --> 33:18.034
Well... no.

33:19.040 --> 33:22.669
But I sure am 100 percent glad
to know that. Thanks for the factoid.

33:27.560 --> 33:31.348
So, er... can I get you a drink?

33:31.480 --> 33:33.755
A glass of H20, if you please,
Mr Hawking.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.077
(Sniffs)

33:42.880 --> 33:44.871
(Man) There's some blood on the floor.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.631
- (Man) Mr Hawking?
- Yeah. I, er...

33:55.760 --> 33:58.194
I broke a vase and, er...

33:58.320 --> 34:01.869
and accidentally cut my arm
on one of the shards.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.197
(Gasps)

34:09.920 --> 34:12.956
- Look...
- Oh, doggy!

34:13.080 --> 34:15.071
That hurts just looking at it.

34:16.159 --> 34:19.469
- What are you doing?
- Getting a sample. Standard procedure.

34:19.600 --> 34:23.149
(Radio) 'Deputy Garmen, Detective
Wood wants you at the station.'

34:23.280 --> 34:25.077
Copy that.

34:25.199 --> 34:28.431
Detective Wood, always breathing
down my neck.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.154
Ain't had a good poke, if you ask me.

34:32.320 --> 34:36.108
I'm not asking, but whatever.

34:36.239 --> 34:37.911
Well, I'd better get a move on.

34:40.199 --> 34:42.190
(Wind chimes clink)

34:42.320 --> 34:45.676
Mmm... What a beautiful night.

34:46.719 --> 34:49.678
You could almost
touch those stars, huh?

34:49.800 --> 34:51.949
Yep.

34:52.080 --> 34:55.072
Although, even if you were travelling
the speed of light

34:55.199 --> 34:58.192
it would take you 1,460 days
to reach the closest one.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.117
Is that right?

35:00.240 --> 35:03.118
Well you are just a walking
factoid factory, partner!

35:03.240 --> 35:06.232
(Laughs) You have yourself
a good night.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.157
You, too, officer.

35:10.280 --> 35:15.479
Oh... would you mind if I took a gander
at that DVD you were watching?

35:18.040 --> 35:20.270
Curiosity killed the cat, Officer.

35:20.400 --> 35:23.517
In my line of work, the cat gets a raise
and a promotion.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.991
(DVD player whirrs)

35:31.880 --> 35:35.111
(Opera singing on TV)

35:35.920 --> 35:38.753
My nine-year-old loves this one.

35:38.880 --> 35:41.394
Especially this part
with this singing cow.

35:44.160 --> 35:46.196
I've got to admit, Stephen...

35:46.320 --> 35:48.311
I thought you were hiding something.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.431
(Laughs)

35:58.720 --> 36:00.711
(Hums)

36:06.600 --> 36:09.478
It kinda looks like
something got dragged here.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.071
You wanna come with me?

36:18.520 --> 36:20.954
I need you to lift this up for me,
Stephen.

36:21.080 --> 36:23.878
- Officer, you don't want to smell...
- Open it.

36:31.640 --> 36:34.154
So much for the raise
and the promotion, Officer!

36:35.200 --> 36:37.714
There we go.

36:37.840 --> 36:41.674
I knew Columbo here would come back
for the DVD. What do we do with him?

36:41.800 --> 36:44.951
- Who is in the septic tank?
- How do I know.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.116
Check the papers, see who's missing.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.993
And then what, Gus?
We killed somebody!

36:50.120 --> 36:54.113
- Oh, you killed somebody!
- Well, you kidnapped a cop!

36:54.240 --> 36:59.155
- Oh, yes, I did! What do you propose?
- I'm turning myself in.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.396
They'll say murdered
the real reverend.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.796
- I had nothing to do with that!
- So? What do they care?

37:04.920 --> 37:08.071
Makes it all nice and neat for them.
No messy loose ends.

37:08.200 --> 37:12.079
I'd bet good money they'll be all, "Gosh!
We finally caught the Undertaker!"

37:12.200 --> 37:14.589
You'll be spitting fire and crying sparks.

37:14.720 --> 37:17.188
Enough, OK? Let's not
make this worse than it is.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.709
Charlie, how could this be any worse?

37:21.440 --> 37:23.829
You're not going anywhere.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.757
You're gonna shoot me?

37:25.880 --> 37:29.077
I've got a family too, Charlie.
I am not going to jail.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.714
I am going to shoot you, Charlie!

37:33.880 --> 37:36.599
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.354
- No, you're not.
- (Yells) Yes, I am!

37:45.200 --> 37:47.191
- (Door shuts)
- Shit!

37:48.480 --> 37:50.277
(Sighs)

37:50.400 --> 37:52.197
(Gun hammer clicks)

37:56.680 --> 37:58.671
Ah! I knew you would...

38:00.360 --> 38:02.271
I wouldn't do that.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.197
Who the hell are you?

38:11.320 --> 38:16.075
Considering that I live here, young man,
the question is, "Who the hell are you?"

38:17.360 --> 38:21.114
It's not what you think, Mrs Smalls.
We're not burglars.

38:21.240 --> 38:24.118
Look... we have some terrible news.

38:24.240 --> 38:27.710
Your husband, the reverend...

38:27.840 --> 38:29.831
has passed on.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.679
Considering I put three bullets
in his head

38:32.800 --> 38:35.439
I should certainly hope so!

38:35.560 --> 38:38.552
Mrs Smalls, you have the right
to remain silent.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.750
- Anything you say...
- Oh, please!

38:40.880 --> 38:42.871
So you killed him?

38:43.000 --> 38:46.197
I spent years turning a blind eye
to that pervert's, er...

38:46.320 --> 38:48.709
shall we say filmmaking aspirations.

38:48.840 --> 38:51.354
Max and I felt we deserved
a share of his benefits.

38:52.600 --> 38:55.717
- Who's Max?
- A real man.

38:56.720 --> 39:01.077
We're going from here to somewhere
where we'll never worry ever again.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.148
- Er... Ahem!
- What?

39:05.280 --> 39:07.953
I think he may already be there.

39:09.200 --> 39:13.637
- What? He wouldn't leave without me.
- He didn't really have a choice.

39:13.760 --> 39:15.955
- It was an accident.
- OK!

39:16.080 --> 39:18.799
- (Charlie) Shut up...
- Why don't you both shut up!

39:21.040 --> 39:23.793
All right, where's the money?

39:24.920 --> 39:29.038
- Sorry, what money?
- Two million dollars doesn't just vanish!

39:29.160 --> 39:31.071
- Two...
- Yeah, where is it?

39:33.560 --> 39:35.437
Oh dear!

39:36.320 --> 39:39.357
I guess I'll just have to count to three.
One...

39:39.480 --> 39:41.471
- No, Mrs Smalls!
- Tell her where it is.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.033
- We don't know!
- Two...

39:43.160 --> 39:45.879
- Tell her!
- (Screaming)

39:58.360 --> 40:02.353
We'll, I'll be!
I haven't heard Pink Floyd in years.

40:11.640 --> 40:14.279
Well, pa, time to fire up
the old septic tank!

40:17.640 --> 40:21.952
- (Door slams)
- By the way, what happened exactly?

40:23.080 --> 40:26.390
Sure. Charlie drowned the reverend,
who he thought was dead

40:26.520 --> 40:28.670
even though he wasn't,
in the septic tank.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.791
Turns out he wasn't the real reverend.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.115
The real reverend was murdered
by his wife,

40:33.240 --> 40:36.312
the woman whose head you split
with an axe - stellar timing!

40:36.440 --> 40:41.309
She planned to run away with her lover,
Max, now deceased, thanks to Charlie,

40:41.440 --> 40:45.319
and the two million dollars the reverend
raised from his side venture

40:45.440 --> 40:48.876
in shooting and selling snuff films.
Okey-dokey?

40:49.000 --> 40:52.549
- Groovy!
- Groovy?

40:52.680 --> 40:55.433
Three people died tonight, Josie.

40:55.560 --> 40:59.109
In this business, unfortunately,
death is an occupational hazard.

40:59.240 --> 41:04.075
And by the way, way to go using
my name in front of the cop... Charlie!

41:04.200 --> 41:06.760
Hey, look. I can help.

41:07.960 --> 41:11.509
I'll testify that I heard Mrs Smalls
confess to killing her husband.

41:11.640 --> 41:15.599
As for Mrs Smalls, she was
threatening the life of a police officer.

41:17.120 --> 41:20.908
- What about the guy in the tank?
- You killed him by accident.

41:21.040 --> 41:24.237
You wouldn't do much time.
Five years, tops.

41:24.360 --> 41:26.351
(Josie) Oh my God!

41:26.480 --> 41:29.313
(Laughs)

41:34.120 --> 41:36.111
Well that doesn't suck!

41:37.440 --> 41:41.035
I have to hand it to you.
That was a brilliant plan after all.

41:41.160 --> 41:44.118
- Can you believe it? We're rich.
- (Josie giggles)

41:44.240 --> 41:46.993
You guys can keep my share.
I'm gonna turn myself in.

41:47.120 --> 41:49.190
If I go to jail, I go to jail.

41:49.320 --> 41:51.550
Don't be ridiculous! You earned this.

41:51.680 --> 41:53.636
They'll just hunt us down like animals.

41:53.760 --> 41:56.593
With this kind of money
you can disappear.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.473
I have a wife and daughter,
I don't want to disappear.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.556
Fine. Gus and I will leave the state

42:01.680 --> 42:04.990
and we'll just drop you and the deputy
in the middle of nowhere.

42:05.120 --> 42:07.554
- How's that sound?
- Let's get rid of the deputy.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.238
- What?
- Good thinking!

42:09.360 --> 42:12.989
Since he's the only one who can testify
that we're innocent of the murder.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.951
OK, Miss Teen Oklahoma...

42:15.080 --> 42:17.275
(Deputy yells) Help!

42:17.840 --> 42:19.592
Help!

42:20.600 --> 42:22.989
(# GLUECIFER: "Shaking So Bad")

42:23.120 --> 42:26.476
# It was a long long hour
in a long long year

42:26.600 --> 42:29.956
# It took a time to get out of the rut

42:30.080 --> 42:33.755
# Now the long gone power
got you bendin' over

42:33.880 --> 42:36.872
# And it is time to get out of the rut

42:37.000 --> 42:39.912
# I said can

42:40.040 --> 42:42.031
# This night go on?

42:43.280 --> 42:44.872
- # I said can... #
- Yes!

42:45.000 --> 42:47.036
- Hold his head.
- What are you doing?

42:47.160 --> 42:49.515
Just helping him relax a little.

42:49.640 --> 42:53.076
# And on and on
and on to the next

42:53.200 --> 42:58.115
# You are heading right in for the crash
and the burn and the fear

42:58.240 --> 43:01.949
# On to the door
where the lock is all locked... #

43:02.080 --> 43:04.594
My friend here decided to surrender.

43:04.720 --> 43:07.154
We'll drop you both somewhere
and say goodbye.

43:07.280 --> 43:11.193
- You're making a big mistake.
- Let's get out of here.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.831
Wait, wait!

43:15.880 --> 43:18.189
- I gotta go pee.
- Oh...

43:18.320 --> 43:21.551
- Please?
- (Sighs) OK.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.876
Wait...

43:26.000 --> 43:28.753
- The handcuffs.
- In your dreams!

43:28.880 --> 43:31.678
There are certain requirements...

43:37.760 --> 43:39.751
(Zipper)

43:40.400 --> 43:43.870
(Giggles) There. Enjoy!

44:02.880 --> 44:05.155
I'm sorry...

44:05.280 --> 44:07.475
I can't go if you're, er... watching.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.830
Could you just close...

44:11.760 --> 44:14.877
Stage fright!
It happens to the best of us.

44:15.920 --> 44:20.277
(Voices echo)

44:33.680 --> 44:35.477
(Knock on door)

44:35.600 --> 44:37.591
(Gus) One minute warning.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.635
You dropped this.

44:49.440 --> 44:52.591
- No, I can explain... Argh!
- Get up, partner!

44:52.720 --> 44:56.235
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- It's a flight to Vegas.

44:56.360 --> 44:59.591
8:00am. We were supposed
to meet at noon to split the money.

44:59.720 --> 45:03.508
- That asshole broke my nose!
- You better have an explanation.

45:03.640 --> 45:08.919
All right, I lied about Thais needing
a cornea transplant. She's fine.

45:10.240 --> 45:13.949
- I owe my wife 300,000 bucks.
- I'm sorry?

45:14.080 --> 45:17.834
I owe my ex-wife 300,000 dollars
and because of her snake of a lawyer

45:17.960 --> 45:20.713
there is a restraining order against me
until I pay up.

45:20.840 --> 45:23.479
I have not seen or talked
to my daughter in two years.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.511
- Why not say?
- Would you have helped?

45:25.640 --> 45:27.915
- Of course not.
- Well, there you go, then!

45:28.040 --> 45:30.508
(Crashing and toilet flushing)

45:37.640 --> 45:40.200
- (Josie) Oh my God!
- There goes our alibi.

45:40.320 --> 45:43.278
Uh-uh! Freakin' fantastic!

45:43.400 --> 45:46.915
Don't you see? None of us
has to run away or turn ourselves in.

45:47.040 --> 45:49.600
What do you propose?
We roam the country

45:49.720 --> 45:51.711
like Bonnie and Clyde... and Clyde?

45:51.840 --> 45:56.595
No. First, we take the cop's car
and crash it into a tree up the road.

45:56.720 --> 45:59.280
We put him and the reverend's wife
in her car

45:59.400 --> 46:01.675
and push it over the cliff
at Grouse Point.

46:01.800 --> 46:06.078
- They'd find the car in a couple of days.
- And what would the forensic figure?

46:06.200 --> 46:10.034
That the deputy was driving under
the influence of alcohol, crashed,

46:10.160 --> 46:12.628
flagged down another car
driven by Mrs Smalls,

46:12.760 --> 46:15.433
took control of the wheel
and drove them off a cliff.

46:15.560 --> 46:19.189
And the wounds, they'd be more
than covered up by the crash.

46:19.320 --> 46:21.834
So the reverend gets murdered
on the same night

46:21.960 --> 46:24.952
that his wife gets driven off a cliff
by a drunken cop?

46:25.080 --> 46:27.196
That doesn't sound very accidental.

46:27.320 --> 46:29.629
You know, he has a point... for once.

46:29.760 --> 46:34.550
OK, er... Then we plant Mrs Smalls'
gun in the car with them.

46:34.680 --> 46:37.433
They figure it was the weapon
that killed the reverend.

46:37.560 --> 46:40.279
They think... maybe she had an affair
with the deputy,

46:40.400 --> 46:45.190
maybe they decide to off the reverend
and then maybe they had an accident.

46:46.120 --> 46:49.749
- That's a hell of a lot of maybes!
- Let's hear your bright idea, boss.

46:57.800 --> 47:00.758
Ooh! Old broad sure liked her food!

Fancy body bags!

47:06.280 --> 47:09.716
- You're eating a lollypop?
- I didn't have dinner. I need the sugar.

47:11.440 --> 47:13.590
- Ow!
- Are you OK?

47:13.720 --> 47:16.439
Yeah. Let's just get this done.

47:16.560 --> 47:19.313
(# LOCAL H: "Hands On The Bible")

47:19.440 --> 47:21.670
# Hands on the bible

# You didn't mean it

Can you go any slower?

48:23.360 --> 48:26.557
We don't wanna attract attention,
now do we?

48:26.680 --> 48:29.274
No, we don't wanna go back in time,
now do we?

48:30.280 --> 48:34.671
It's only by going faster than light that
one could theoretically go back in time.

48:34.800 --> 48:37.712
Yeah! Do me a favour -
shut the fuck up!

48:39.760 --> 48:43.992
You have some serious stress-related
issues. You're not Canadian, are you?

48:44.120 --> 48:46.156
Wh... What?

48:46.280 --> 48:50.831
The 2003 statistical report on the health
of Canadians states that 62 percent...

48:50.960 --> 48:56.159
What's wrong with you? You pull these
random facts and stats out of your ass,

48:56.280 --> 48:58.714
and nobody really gives a shit!

48:58.840 --> 49:01.308
- Guys!
- Jesus Christ, man!

49:01.440 --> 49:03.590
Charlie, here's a nifty stat for you -

49:03.720 --> 49:07.156
for a guy that knows everything,
to get a job in a call centre

49:07.280 --> 49:11.034
you have to be, bar none, the biggest
loser I have ever met in my life.

49:11.160 --> 49:13.151
And I'm from Las Vegas!

49:26.200 --> 49:29.795
You ever hear of a neurotransmitter
called acetylcholine?

49:29.920 --> 49:31.512
What?

49:31.640 --> 49:35.428
It's the chemical your brain uses
for memory... dummy.

49:36.440 --> 49:38.556
- Is it?
- Yeah, that's exactly right.

49:38.680 --> 49:43.151
See, the reason I lost my teaching job
is I have this disorder,

49:43.280 --> 49:46.511
typified by a gradual, acute
neuro-degeneration

49:46.640 --> 49:48.631
of the cerebral cortex.

49:48.760 --> 49:53.675
Or if that's too "pulled out of my ass"
for you, I'm slowly losing my memory.

49:55.240 --> 49:56.832
Are you making this up?

49:56.960 --> 50:00.839
The doctors think that, in a year or two,
my mind will be a total blank.

50:00.960 --> 50:03.428
So the only thing I can do
to slow things down

50:03.560 --> 50:06.677
is to keep working my memory
as much as possible.

50:07.840 --> 50:09.990
Do you remember
what's in the blue bag?

50:10.120 --> 50:12.793
- What blue bag?
- (Laughs)

50:14.280 --> 50:17.590
Jeez, guy, I'm really sorry.
You know...

50:20.760 --> 50:23.194
(Car brakes whine)

50:26.040 --> 50:29.032
Hey, Gus, what's the Greek word
for bullshit?

50:35.160 --> 50:37.151
- You sonofabitch!
- Stop it!

50:37.280 --> 50:39.236
(Gus) Damn it! What the...

50:39.360 --> 50:41.555
(Car horn honks and tyres screech)

50:43.360 --> 50:46.397
- Are you fucking crazy?
- He lied to us again!

50:46.520 --> 50:48.988
He doesn't have a daughter...

50:49.120 --> 50:51.873
Is everyone OK in there?

50:54.520 --> 50:56.556
We're fine.

50:56.680 --> 50:59.956
Everything's fine.
So, thanks for coming over.

51:00.080 --> 51:02.674
- I think we should call the police.
- What?

51:02.800 --> 51:05.758
No, let's not bother them.
They've got a lot on their plate.

51:05.880 --> 51:07.871
You're fine, your car's fine.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.595
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
that's standard procedure, isn't it?

51:12.880 --> 51:16.589
I'll be honest with you - I don't give
a rat's ass for standard procedure.

51:16.720 --> 51:20.508
Here, why don't you pack your fat ass
back in your car

51:20.640 --> 51:23.598
and buy yourself as big a sandwich
as your heart desires.

51:23.720 --> 51:26.598
Is that standard enough
procedure for you?

51:26.720 --> 51:28.870
- Your trunk is open.
- What?

51:30.680 --> 51:32.875
You all going on a trip somewhere?

51:33.000 --> 51:36.993
Sure looks you're packed for a long one.
Is that your entire wardrobe in there?

51:37.120 --> 51:39.350
No, it's a couple of dead bodies.

51:41.120 --> 51:43.873
(Both laugh)

51:44.000 --> 51:46.673
- That was a good one!
- I'm glad you liked it...

51:46.800 --> 51:49.234
- (Beeping)
- Oh, jeez!

51:49.360 --> 51:52.909
Oh, it's time for old stingy!

51:53.040 --> 51:54.871
What?

51:55.000 --> 51:57.070
Oh, it's insulin.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.191
Whatever!

52:00.400 --> 52:01.992
(Car door shuts)

52:06.640 --> 52:08.915
Freak show!

52:10.880 --> 52:12.757
- Ow!
- You sonofabitch!

52:12.880 --> 52:16.236
Granted, I lied, but I have
a responsibility towards myself.

52:16.360 --> 52:19.511
- When I got out of prison, I swore...
- What? What?

52:19.640 --> 52:22.438
You were in prison? For what?

52:22.560 --> 52:26.394
I kind of convinced some people
to invest in some businesses

52:26.520 --> 52:29.353
that weren't actually,
technically in existence.

52:29.480 --> 52:32.233
- Anything else you forgot, sociopath?
- Oh, come on!

52:32.360 --> 52:35.272
- Aren't you overreacting a bit?
- Overreacting?

52:35.400 --> 52:37.834
I happen to be a very good conman.

52:37.960 --> 52:40.997
That's my talent. What do you want
me to do, waste it?

52:41.120 --> 52:44.157
You don't go around using it
on your partners, jerk!

52:45.080 --> 52:48.629
I bet Gus isn't even your real name.
What is it?

52:48.760 --> 52:52.196
- No, really, I'd love to know.
- My mother, God rest her soul...

52:52.320 --> 52:55.118
- (Charlie laughs)
...named me after Augustus...

53:00.560 --> 53:03.836
(# KARL JENKINS: Sanctus -
The Armed Man - A Mass For Peace)

53:28.520 --> 53:30.511
(Charlie) What the...

53:36.240 --> 53:40.916
- Maybe she's jumped out the trunk.
- She didn't jump out of any trunk.

53:41.040 --> 53:43.395
- She's fucking dead.
- Did you check her pulse?

53:43.520 --> 53:46.592
- Er... no.
- Why didn't you check her pulse?

53:46.720 --> 53:50.315
Because I assume that when you
have an axe lodged in your skull

53:50.440 --> 53:52.431
your pulse tends to bottom out on you!

53:52.560 --> 53:56.439
- Maybe you shouldn't assume so much.
- All right, just settle down, kids!

53:56.560 --> 54:00.075
All that matters now is that we find her
before someone else does.

54:00.200 --> 54:04.034
- Try to keep it on the road this time!
- Hey, fuck you! Fuck you both!

54:04.160 --> 54:10.076
When people ain't punching me
in the eye, my driving is just perfect.

54:10.200 --> 54:11.838
(All) Argh!

54:11.960 --> 54:14.520
(Tyres screech)

54:33.560 --> 54:36.438
- Want me to check her pulse?
- (Siren wails)

54:41.720 --> 54:43.790
- Shit!

54:47.320 --> 54:49.914
- Charlie?
- Hi, honey!

54:50.040 --> 54:53.271
- (Penny) What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

54:54.480 --> 54:58.109
Wh... We had an anonymous call
reporting a body in the road.

54:58.240 --> 54:59.958
We just ran over it.

55:00.080 --> 55:02.355
Hi, I'm Josie McBroom.

55:02.480 --> 55:05.472
I thought you were having a drink
with your supervisor.

55:05.600 --> 55:09.912
Technically, I'm Junior Supervisor
but they did place Charlie under me.

55:10.920 --> 55:14.310
- Oh...
- And you must be...

55:14.440 --> 55:16.192
- Penelope Wood.
- Penelope.

55:16.320 --> 55:18.675
- Detective Penelope Wood.
- Of course!

55:18.800 --> 55:22.236
Charlie has told me a lot about you...

55:22.360 --> 55:25.113
Did he say he has a little girl
and that I brought her...

55:25.240 --> 55:28.676
- Emily's here?
...because there's no one at home?

55:28.800 --> 55:30.791
Now, what happened, exactly?

55:30.920 --> 55:34.629
Well, we were driving into town

55:34.760 --> 55:37.149
and all of a sudden - bang!

55:37.280 --> 55:40.636
We ran over this body here. There
was nothing I could do to avoid her.

55:40.760 --> 55:44.150
No one could have. I swear,
she just popped out of nowhere.

55:45.480 --> 55:48.756
- And you are?
- Who, me? I'm Gus.

55:48.880 --> 55:52.395
Gus Dickinson is my name.
A co-worker of Charlie's.

55:53.920 --> 55:56.912
- Who are you calling?
- My deputy.

Aren't you gonna answer that?

56:08.560 --> 56:11.472
Uh-uh! It's probably
just my ex-boyfriend.

56:11.600 --> 56:13.750
Freakin' stalker, you know?

56:16.480 --> 56:21.076
Deputy Garmen, Detective Wood here.
You need to report in immediately.

56:21.200 --> 56:23.839
- (Mobile phone rings)
- (Pen) Detective Wood.

56:25.680 --> 56:27.477
Where?

56:29.160 --> 56:31.037
Shit!

56:31.160 --> 56:33.549
- The Eye is at the station.
- The what?

56:33.680 --> 56:38.629
All right, I want you all to follow me down
there. I'm gonna need your statements.

56:38.760 --> 56:42.116
Can't that wait till tomorrow?
I'm sure it more productive

56:42.240 --> 56:44.800
if we'd had a good night's sleep, right?

56:46.400 --> 56:47.833
(Siren wails)

56:47.960 --> 56:51.475
You might have mentioned
that your wife was a detective.

56:51.600 --> 56:52.999
Shut up.

56:53.120 --> 56:56.192
Gus, you might have mentioned
about not really owing alimony

56:56.320 --> 57:00.108

imaginary daughter not really going blind.

57:00.240 --> 57:02.390

Everyone, this is Special Agent
Chester Hymes.

Well, can you beat this?
My friends with the bodies in the trunk.

57:11.600 --> 57:13.477
- What?
- It's an inside joke!

57:13.600 --> 57:16.398
We ran into each other earlier.
How do you do?

57:18.240 --> 57:21.198
- I'm ready.
- Charlie, can you look after Emmy.

57:21.320 --> 57:23.311
You two follow us.

57:25.600 --> 57:28.558
- We're screwed!
- Not if we keep out story straight.

57:28.680 --> 57:32.116
We had a few beers at Gus's place,
that's the end if it. Got it?

57:32.240 --> 57:34.674
(Both) Got it.

57:34.800 --> 57:36.438
Gus...

57:37.440 --> 57:39.908
- We're screwed!
- Oh, come on!

57:40.040 --> 57:42.838
Do you think Agent Hippo
is gonna figure out more

57:42.960 --> 57:45.474
than where to find a really great buffet?

57:45.600 --> 57:48.353
These abrasions on her knees
and elbows

57:48.480 --> 57:50.755
indicate a leap from a moving vehicle.

57:50.880 --> 57:54.475
We can deduce that Mrs Smalls'
would-be killer

57:54.600 --> 57:59.230
presupposed her already dead when
she was transported by automobile.

57:59.360 --> 58:02.909
- (Gus gasps)
- Are you all right, Mr Dickinson?

58:03.040 --> 58:07.511
Er... yeah. This is the first dead body
for me, so...

58:08.560 --> 58:10.596
- And I drunk beers at my place.
- Yeah.

58:10.720 --> 58:14.235
Other than the axe wound,
which, judging from the angle of entry,

58:14.360 --> 58:17.750
came from a much shorter person,
possibly a female,

58:17.880 --> 58:21.509
nothing here indicates
any sort of fisticuffs ever took place.

58:21.640 --> 58:26.998
I can safely say that Mrs Smalls'
murderer can be found...

58:27.120 --> 58:29.031
within this very room.

58:29.160 --> 58:31.879
- (Penny) What?
- Oh! Just a figure of speech!

58:32.000 --> 58:36.596
What I mean to say is her body
will tell me who her killer is

58:36.720 --> 58:39.393
after a more thorough examination.

58:39.520 --> 58:43.035
However, I can hazard a name
right now.

58:43.160 --> 58:45.515
Please do.

58:45.640 --> 58:49.474
I'm sure it will come as no surprise
that her killer

58:49.600 --> 58:51.989
is none other than...

58:53.320 --> 58:55.754
...the Oregon Undertaker.

58:55.880 --> 58:59.759
Well, we all could have figured
that out, Agent Hymes.

58:59.880 --> 59:02.075
Indeed.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.878
(# EELS: "Theme From Blinking Lights")

59:35.280 --> 59:37.555
Everything's gonna be OK, sweetie.

59:46.080 --> 59:50.790
Hey! So, er... I guess
I'll take Emily home.

59:50.920 --> 59:52.911
Why don't you leave her here with me?

59:54.240 --> 59:57.312
- Yah, but I can easily...
- Goodnight.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:03.519
(Yells) Wait! You're not
going anywhere, little lady!

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.069
Not without your coat.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.796
- Would anyone care to say something?
- Just take me home.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.394
No way! We've got a dead cop
to ditch first.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.433
I don't care about the cop. I don't
even care about the money anymore.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.235
I just wanna go home
and pretend this never happened.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.716
Yeah, it hasn't exactly been
a run-of-the-mill night on the town.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.308
All I wanted was to take care
of my family.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:42.155
OK, Charlie, the sooner we dispose
of the deputy's body,

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.670
the sooner you can get started on your
pretend happily ever after.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.268

- Absolutely!

- Never.

So what does that mean?
He won't sink?

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.351
He'll sink. It might take a week or so,
but he'll sink.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.870
Well... we better get started then.

I figured it would be more expedient
than listening to bull pucky testimony.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.478
I guess I was right, just like always.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.591
- OK...
- Listen...

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:46.714
Agent Hymes, you let us go and there's
a million dollars with your name on it.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.916
You're offering a Federal agent
a bribe?

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.429
- Yeah.
- Thanks, little lady.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.309
Gus, come over here for a second,
would you?

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.635
Tell me I'm fat!

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.149
(Laughs) I was joking!

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.670
I wanna hear you tell the fat guy
how fat he is.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.314
I was kidding, all right?

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.151
You might be a little on the heavy side

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.033
but it's nothing that a few centuries
jogging can't fix!

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:22.312
- Argh! Sonofabitch!
- I'm sorry, did that pinch?

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:28.356
All right, the official version is that
Gus here attacked me during an arrest.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.314
- And I was defending myself...
- Stupid walrus... Argh!

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:37.798
The official version is that Gus tripped
and fell on his face during the arrest.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:43.040
Ok, there's two million dollars in a bag
in the car. It's all yours, just take it.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.789
Wow! Can you beat that?
One million just became two million.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.629
And people said this economy
would never bounce back!

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.876
Argh!

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.877
- Shoot him in the fucking eye!
- What? Shut up!

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.433
- Wait!
- Don't move!

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.760
- I know who you are.
- What?

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:11.432
I thought you looked familiar...
Fellas, your accomplice is Lucy Bloom,

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:16.429
AKA Lucy McJoseph,
AKA Josie McBroom.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.519
- What are you talking about?
- You're the Wyoming Widow.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.312
What?

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.876
Gentlemen, the Wyoming Widow's
MO is always the same.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.279
She seduces an unsuspecting fellow,
she fornicates with him

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.789
and then she offers up
a little sip of whiskey.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:38.152
The poor sucker never lives long enough
to realise that he also just drank

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.510
highly concentrated thallium.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.394
You've been watching too many
soap operas, Agent Hymes!

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.189
You're not believing this crap, are you?

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:54.632
They say that she always keeps
her trusty flask on her person,

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:58.309
just in case the next bug
flies into her web.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:03.594
Oh, come on! He's just making
this crap up to save his ass!

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:08.669
I could have sworn I felt one inside
of her coat pocket back at the station.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.396
Empty your pockets, Josie.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.634
Charlie...

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.433
Holy shit!

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:30.870
You planted this in my coat
back at the station, didn't you?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.831
No, I didn't. I swear to God!

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.757
This isn't mine.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:39.192
- He is lying. He is lying!
- Take a drink.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.514
- Oh...
- (Gus) Take a sip, Josie.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.953
There.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.918
Are you ha...

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.349
- Josie?
- Oh, my God!

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.075
Oh, God! Josie!
Come on, spit it out!

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.237
(Laughs)

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.511
- You are so pathetic!
- That was not funny.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:18.351

trying to mess with us! Fuck! Fuck!

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:23.395

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.511

(Gun clatters)

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.471
I think that belongs to Uncle Sam.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.592
Now hold on.
We're on the same side here, Chester.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.077
I'm an agent too.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.790
- When the hell did you take that off me?
- Back at the station.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.399
(Gun hammer clicks)

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:55.910
Listen, here's the thing, Gus -

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.952
there's a friend of mine,
an agent, one of the best.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.594
He's been protecting the innocent
a long time now.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.393
And, well...

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.954
he's gotten fed up
with working his ass off

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:10.709
for ungrateful morons
who call him fatty.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.791
A pat on the back if things go right,

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.718
or the stars and stripes on his coffin
if they don't.

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.831
It just doesn't cut it anymore.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.756
I have two million here.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.599
Believe when I say
no one will ever claim it.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:29.429
Tell your friend there's a million for him
and a million for me.

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:33.712
What about two million for him
and nothing for you.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.593
Oh, come on, Chetty!
We're partners here.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:40.508
You insult me, Gus.
You're not even a real criminal.

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.029
You're just a small-time crook

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.720
who got shot twice in the chest
resisting arrest.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.553
Listen, I have a daughter, Thais...

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.957
Thais. That's Greek for 'Beloved'.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.274
(Silenced gunshots)

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.912
- You shot me.
- That's the first true thing you've said.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:14.471
(Huffs and puffs)

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:21.555

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.911

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.472
It's all right, sweetheart.
Go back to sleep.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.191
(Coughing and spitting)

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.357
(Splutters) Wait! You know I can't eat
this much sugar.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.948
You shouldn't do this.

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.197
- Like you shouldn't have killed Gus.
- Keep eating.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.117
(Crunches)

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.959
Gus was a backstabber.

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:34.436
He told me he was gonna kill you
and make off with the money.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:40.037
That's why I killed him. I saved your life.
I'm telling you the truth!

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.676
89.9 percent of all US Government
agents can beat a lie detector.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.312
Please... this isn't right, Charlie.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.034
You know this isn't right.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.835
- Your wife is an officer of the law.
- Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.076

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:06.313
I don't wanna die...

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.796
(Gasps) Please... Oh...

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.388
(Retches)

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.431
- God, we really did it, huh?
- What?

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.790
We really turned into monsters.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.392

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.591
Oh, come on.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.314
I say it was worth it.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.437
Let's get the body in the car.
It's heavy enough to sink.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.949
Wait...

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:49.833

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.075

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:59.032

none of this ever happened...

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:04.911
One sip of this... and you can kiss
all your worries goodbye.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.438
- The Wyoming Widow?
- Yeah.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.717
- But I saw you drink it.
- (Laughs)

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.752
Never far from my trusty flasks!

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.479
- Brilliant.
- Yeah!

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.593
After all, I was Miss Teen Wyoming.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:30.838
Now, Obviously I can't let you go
and risk having you report me

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.636
and, fuck, two million does sound
a heck of a lot nicer than one million!

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:39.558
- You were right, Penny.
- What's that?

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.513
Penelope always said money
won't make you rich, I just...

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.154
I just didn't believe her.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:51.030
You do seem like
a genuinely decent guy, Charlie.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:54.835
- I'm real sorry I gotta do this.
- You don't have a choice, do you?

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.520
No, I don't. But you do.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.758
You want me to shoot you
or you want to go for the whiskey?

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.831
What did Hymes say you used?

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:10.396
Concentrated thallium.
Much quicker than cyanide.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.116

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.991
