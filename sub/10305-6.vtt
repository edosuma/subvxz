00:02.460 --> 00:05.258
You know, Peg,
I hate to be a needy husband...

00:05.460 --> 00:09.817
...a demanding husband,
and your husband...

00:11.180 --> 00:14.217
...but where the hell
is my Thanksgiving pie tin?

00:14.420 --> 00:18.652
Why don't you check under the couch
where I keep the other dirty dishes?

00:19.140 --> 00:21.813
Once again, Peg, way to homemake.

00:22.740 --> 00:24.890
You see, now, I can't quite reach.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.818
Well, here.

00:27.020 --> 00:29.932
You wanna try my bonbon retriever?

00:30.580 --> 00:32.935
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I got something.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.492
Hey, it's from Bud's nursery school.

00:41.620 --> 00:44.896
He failed his T.B. test, Peg.

00:46.020 --> 00:48.454
I told him to study.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.776
Damn cough. I just can't shake it.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.495
Happy Thanksgiving, all.

01:01.900 --> 01:04.289
<i>Vacuuming for lost hair, Al?</i>

01:05.340 --> 01:09.299
Why don't you take your
shrivelled-up gourds on out of here?

01:10.300 --> 01:12.734
And your cornucopia too.

01:13.940 --> 01:17.296
Wow, corn. Thanks, Mrs. D'Arcy.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.771
Those are shellacked, you aphid.

01:26.580 --> 01:30.334
Peggy, aren't you gonna cook a turkey
for your family this Thanksgiving?

01:30.820 --> 01:34.051
You expect me to cook on a holiday?

01:34.260 --> 01:37.093
Homemaking a job too, you know.

01:37.300 --> 01:39.814
Why don't you apply for it, Peg?

01:44.700 --> 01:47.737
Hey, I found it.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.939
Oh, good. Now you can put
that metal plate back in your head.

01:54.940 --> 01:59.297
Although, that's a lot like putting
a lid on an empty jar.

02:00.580 --> 02:02.855
Or a bra on you.

02:07.700 --> 02:10.055
This pie tin is worth 25 cents...

02:10.259 --> 02:14.094
...towards one of Aunt Maddie's
famous sweet potato pies.

02:16.180 --> 02:18.614
If she's so famous,
how come I haven't heard of her?

02:18.820 --> 02:22.130
I don't know. Maybe because
she doesn't make chicken pies.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.010
Please don't get him started
on Aunt Maddie.

02:29.260 --> 02:33.936
Bud, unlike the happy childhood
we provided for you...

02:34.140 --> 02:37.371
...I didn't have such a fortunate
upbringing.

02:37.740 --> 02:43.178
Oh, well, I'm sure
Mr. and Mrs. Sasquatch did their best.

02:44.300 --> 02:48.179
But we did have one holiday tradition
that we cherished.

02:48.380 --> 02:50.894
Mom would serve Dad
the traditional Wild Turkey...

02:51.100 --> 02:53.853
...and then chug
the rest of the bottle.

02:55.020 --> 02:58.649
We'd weave on down to Aunt Maddie's
and pick up a sweet potato pie...

02:58.860 --> 03:01.090
...then go back home,
the folks would pass out...

03:01.300 --> 03:05.418
...and I'd have me that sweet potato pie
all to myself.

03:05.980 --> 03:09.256
Sort of makes you all warm
and fuzzy inside, doesn't it?

03:09.460 --> 03:12.770
That's what Mom said
about that Wild Turkey.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.074

03:50.940 --> 03:54.137
Yeah. Shake it, baby.

03:55.180 --> 03:59.696
Oh, hey, that Miss Piggy is always
a hit in the Thanksgiving Day Parade.

04:00.140 --> 04:03.576
<i>And, kids, looks who's coming up:
Betty Boop.</i>

04:03.780 --> 04:05.975
Oh, she's fine.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.850
Oh, Bud.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.290
I'm a dead man.
I couldn't get the turkey.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.616
Marcy's gonna kill me.

04:19.380 --> 04:22.292
Whoa, check out Betty Boop.

04:23.300 --> 04:25.860
Those have gotta be fake.

04:26.580 --> 04:29.538
That's nothing. Miss Piggy's dress
got caught on a traffic light.

04:29.740 --> 04:31.492
I saw everything.

04:31.700 --> 04:32.769
<i>Everything.</i>

04:32.980 --> 04:36.290
Oh, the parade.

04:36.500 --> 04:41.176
Hey, when did they get
a Rush Limbaugh balloon?

04:41.500 --> 04:44.651
No, Mom. That-
That is Rush Limbaugh.

04:46.180 --> 04:47.533
Peggy. Peggy, help.

04:47.740 --> 04:49.935
Look, Thanksgiving
is Marcy's favourite holiday.

04:50.140 --> 04:53.018
If I ruin it,
she's gonna cut off my giblets.

04:54.060 --> 04:57.257
I thought she did that
a long time ago.

04:57.740 --> 04:59.014
Will you sell me your turkey?

04:59.260 --> 05:02.172
Well, I'd give him to you,
but he's out getting pie.

05:04.100 --> 05:08.378
I'm dead. There's not a single turkey
left in all of Chicago.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.532
Hey, you guys.

05:18.140 --> 05:21.655
Look at this fat chicken
that followed me home.

05:22.420 --> 05:23.933
I'm gonna name him Hank.

05:29.940 --> 05:31.453
Hello. Hello.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.930
Aunt Maddie, open up.

05:34.180 --> 05:36.057
Hey, Al, they're closed.

05:36.260 --> 05:38.057
Says there's been a death
in the family.

05:38.260 --> 05:42.458
Oh, God, no. Does that mean
no pie this Thanksgiving?

05:42.820 --> 05:43.889
Can I help you folks?

05:44.100 --> 05:46.614
Yeah, I need to find Aunt Maddie.
You know where she is?

05:46.820 --> 05:49.937
- Oh, she's down at the church, son.
- And where is that?

05:50.140 --> 05:53.576
Now, you go down to the end
of the block and you make a right.

05:53.780 --> 05:56.977
Go past the barber shop,
and you take your first right.

05:57.180 --> 05:59.694
Go another block,
make another right...

05:59.900 --> 06:03.654
...then one more right,
and it's on your right.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.968
Well, wouldn't it be easier
just to cross the street?

06:08.180 --> 06:11.650
Sure.
But I need a ride to the barber shop.

06:18.580 --> 06:20.377
How you doing?

06:21.620 --> 06:23.497
Turkey on Thanksgiving.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.895
This could catch on.

06:27.340 --> 06:28.898
Kelly.

06:29.340 --> 06:30.659
Look at the-

06:30.860 --> 06:33.852
Look at the nice bed
we made for Hank.

06:38.060 --> 06:40.528
Listen, honey,
when he's all snuggled in...

06:40.740 --> 06:42.935
...we'll kiss him goodbye.

06:43.140 --> 06:45.176
I meant, good night.

06:45.380 --> 06:49.692
And then we're gonna put him
into his little house.

06:49.940 --> 06:53.615
Well, I don't know if he's gonna like it.
Hank's afraid of the dark.

06:53.820 --> 06:58.575
Oh, but see, if I turn this little dial...

06:59.220 --> 07:02.735
...his house fills up with a pretty
blue light.

07:03.660 --> 07:08.211
Yeah, and- And he'll be real comfy
sleeping on these bread crumbs.

07:08.420 --> 07:11.810
And, honey, I made him a blanket.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.930
Wait a minute.

07:18.180 --> 07:20.057
I know what you guys
are trying to do.

07:21.940 --> 07:25.330
You're trying to get Hank
to like you more than me.

07:26.940 --> 07:30.410
Well, I am sorry.
We're too smart to fall for that.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.571
All right,
this is what we're gonna do.

07:32.780 --> 07:35.453
I'll distract her,
while you snap the neck.

07:36.660 --> 07:38.696
Couldn't you snap her neck?

07:39.100 --> 07:41.694
I mean, after all, she is my sister. I-

07:43.060 --> 07:46.211
Kelly, honey,
I'm getting a little concerned.

07:46.420 --> 07:48.980
Yeah, you're getting
very attached to Hank...

07:49.180 --> 07:51.614
...and the life span of a turkey
is very short.

07:51.820 --> 07:54.254
Especially this time of year.

07:54.460 --> 07:57.975
Kelly, what are you doing?
These are my pants.

07:58.460 --> 08:02.533
I know, but you and Hank
are about the same size.

08:03.340 --> 08:07.413
What-? What are you doing
with your hands around Hank's neck?

08:08.740 --> 08:11.129
Just checking his pulse.

08:12.180 --> 08:13.818
He doesn't look too good.

08:14.020 --> 08:16.329
Could be turkey pox.

08:16.540 --> 08:20.169
Maybe we should check
his temperature with this.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.413
Yeah.

08:24.740 --> 08:28.653
But first, we better take off
his feathers and examine him.

08:28.860 --> 08:30.612
Wait a minute.

08:30.820 --> 08:33.174
I know what you guys are up to.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.292
You just wanna see Hank naked.
God.

08:40.539 --> 08:42.337
Excuse me. I'm-

08:42.539 --> 08:43.972
I'm looking for Aunt Maddie.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.931
Here she comes now.

08:59.580 --> 09:03.289
I don't know how I can live
without the warmth and sweetness.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.218
We're all gonna miss her.

09:05.740 --> 09:10.131
That unforgettable, spicy flavour...

09:10.740 --> 09:13.812
...and buttery bottom.

09:17.900 --> 09:21.290
Good Lord,
is he talking about Aunt Maddie?

09:21.500 --> 09:25.254
I think Aunt Maddie had jungle fever
with this man.

09:28.220 --> 09:29.972
So...

09:30.180 --> 09:32.330
...you come here often?

09:33.380 --> 09:37.532
Do you mind?
I'm overwhelmed with grief.

09:37.740 --> 09:40.857
Well, how would you like
to be overwhelmed by Griff?

09:44.540 --> 09:47.100
Gentlemen, excuse me.
I don't believe we've met.

09:47.340 --> 09:51.015
I'm James Brown,
Aunt Maddie's nephew.

09:55.580 --> 09:59.493
<i>- Aren't you that guy on TV?
- The the host of NFL on Fox?</i>

09:59.700 --> 10:02.419
Why, yes, I am.
But you know, I also cover hockey.

10:02.620 --> 10:05.259
Yeah, but who cares about that?

10:05.460 --> 10:07.098
So you knew my Aunt Maddie?

10:07.740 --> 10:09.458
I have very fond memories
of your aunt.

10:09.660 --> 10:13.175
My mother and father use to take me
to her pie store every Thanksgiving.

10:13.420 --> 10:16.332
I'd try to steal a cookie and
she'd slap me upside the head.

10:16.580 --> 10:19.572
Then she'd give me a cookie anyway.
She was a wonderful woman.

10:19.780 --> 10:22.499
Wait a minute.
Don't tell me you're Al Bundy?

10:22.700 --> 10:25.453
- Yeah, did she talk about me?
- Oh, my goodness. All the time.

10:25.660 --> 10:28.652
As a matter of fact,
I'm where I am today because of you.

10:28.860 --> 10:30.054
Really?

10:30.260 --> 10:32.899
<i>Yeah. I can hear her now.
She used to always say:</i>

10:33.100 --> 10:36.615
"James, do your homework
or you'll wind up like Al Bundy. "

10:41.780 --> 10:44.248
Yeah, I'm glad I could help.

10:44.460 --> 10:47.213
So you're staying for pie?

10:48.660 --> 10:50.013
- Pie?
- Pie?

10:50.220 --> 10:51.653
Of course. After the service...

10:51.860 --> 10:57.332
...we're all gonna have a bit
of Aunt Maddie's last sweet potato pie.

10:59.260 --> 11:05.733
<i>Hallelujah</i>

11:10.100 --> 11:13.888
Hanky, your bubble bath's ready.

11:17.860 --> 11:20.135
Okay. Let's kill him.

11:20.340 --> 11:23.377
Hanky, Pooky, are you down here?

11:23.780 --> 11:26.089
Hey, what are you doing?

11:26.300 --> 11:28.097
Oh, this is ridiculous.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.734
Kelly, look, I know you love Hank.

11:30.980 --> 11:33.778
So I'm gonna say this
as gently as possible.

11:33.980 --> 11:35.698
We're gonna cut
that bird's head off...

11:35.900 --> 11:38.539
...stuff his butt full of bread,
and eat him.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.739
Oh, get away! Get away!

11:41.940 --> 11:44.215
You are not gonna kill Hank.

11:46.020 --> 11:48.693
Kelly? Honey, it's your mother.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.016
You know I'm on your side.

11:51.220 --> 11:54.098
How many heart-to-hearts
have we had through this door?

11:54.300 --> 11:56.894
Mom, that's the linen closet.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.456
We have a linen closet?

12:03.020 --> 12:04.248
Open up.

12:04.460 --> 12:06.655
Go away, you turkey-haters.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.818
Kelly, I promise he won't feel a thing.

12:10.020 --> 12:13.171
This isn't one of your dates, Bud.

12:14.820 --> 12:16.776
I'm sorry, Hank.

12:16.980 --> 12:19.289
I really wanna keep you...

12:19.500 --> 12:21.218
...but it's not safe here.

12:21.420 --> 12:23.888
I'm gonna have to set you free.

12:24.900 --> 12:29.178
Oh, me too. I'll never forget you.

12:34.140 --> 12:36.176
Fly away, Hank.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.014
Fly like the wind!

12:46.780 --> 12:50.136
I meant fly up, Hank!

12:51.260 --> 12:53.296
<i>Gonna lay down my sword and shield</i>

12:53.500 --> 12:55.297
<i>Down by the riverside</i>

12:55.540 --> 13:03.652
<i>Down by the riverside</i>

13:03.860 --> 13:05.657
Oh, that was inspirational!

13:05.860 --> 13:07.657
Let's do another one!

13:07.860 --> 13:10.169
Amen, brother Griff.

13:10.380 --> 13:12.655
- What?
- I've been waiting for one year...

13:12.860 --> 13:14.293
...for a taste of that pie...

13:14.500 --> 13:17.572
...so if you don't wanna make this
a double funeral, stop singing.

13:17.780 --> 13:21.375
<i>He's got the whole world
In his hands</i>

13:21.580 --> 13:24.856
<i>He's got whole wide world
In his hands</i>

13:25.060 --> 13:28.973
<i>He's got the whole world
In his hands</i>

13:29.180 --> 13:32.536
<i>I want that whole pie
In my hands</i>

13:32.740 --> 13:36.369
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Reverend Hightower.

13:36.580 --> 13:41.256
Now, this glorious music has ridden on
angel's wings to Aunt Maddie's ears.

13:41.460 --> 13:46.454
But now it's time to celebrate her life
by sharing this...

13:47.020 --> 13:48.692
...heavenly pie.

13:48.900 --> 13:51.289
Hallelujah.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.890
Brother Al's deep love
for Aunt Maddie's pie...

13:55.100 --> 13:58.172
...should be an inspiration to us all.

13:58.740 --> 14:03.018
Well, not to us all.
There's only one pie.

14:04.220 --> 14:08.293
Brother Al used the word " heavenly,"
and he is right.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.615
Yes.

14:09.820 --> 14:13.893
He's so right that we cannot,
we should not...

14:14.100 --> 14:17.888
...we must not divide this pie.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.338
Hallelujah.

14:20.540 --> 14:25.455
Because only one is worthy of it.

14:27.220 --> 14:29.973
I think they're gonna give me
this pie.

14:31.180 --> 14:33.899
As brother Al suggests...

14:34.100 --> 14:38.173
...this pie should go
to our heavenly Father.

14:38.380 --> 14:40.018
- Yes, sir.
- Amen.

14:40.220 --> 14:42.973
Him? Him? Why him?

14:43.180 --> 14:45.853
He can get a pie
any time he wants to.

14:46.340 --> 14:49.491
No, wait, wait. Please, don't take it.

14:49.700 --> 14:50.735
You're right.

14:50.940 --> 14:53.534
We can't take it, brother Al.

14:53.740 --> 14:56.732
Only Aunt Maddie can take it to him.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.778
- That's right.
- Yes.

14:59.980 --> 15:01.572
Let's us bow our heads in prayer.

15:01.780 --> 15:03.975
Yes, let us pray.

15:11.820 --> 15:14.414
Aunt Maddie, excuse me...

15:14.620 --> 15:18.579
...but I just know
you'd want me to have this last pie.

15:19.780 --> 15:23.295
So if you could,
would you just give me a sign?

15:23.500 --> 15:25.695
Any sign at all.

15:30.540 --> 15:33.373
Even if the sign is no sign.

15:39.260 --> 15:40.818
Good.

15:41.980 --> 15:46.258
Then the sign is no sign at all.

15:53.020 --> 15:56.410
You know, she was-
She was getting cold.

15:57.860 --> 16:01.694
That no-count Bundy boy
is stealing Aunt Maddie's pie.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.015
Get him.

16:44.060 --> 16:47.336
Well, who knew
that turkeys couldn't fly?

16:48.820 --> 16:49.809
I did.

16:50.020 --> 16:51.339
- Me too.
- Ditto.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.849
Jefferson,
thanks for my Thanksgiving turkey.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.891
Well, you really have to thank Kelly.

17:00.100 --> 17:04.093
I mean, she's the one who threw him
to his neck-snapping death.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.020
I'm so sorry, Hank.

17:10.180 --> 17:12.410
You're talking into his butt.

17:15.339 --> 17:17.330
His head's in the garbage.

17:20.020 --> 17:22.454
You guys are really
being insensitive.

17:22.660 --> 17:24.616
- Honey, it was an accident.
- Right.

17:24.819 --> 17:26.935
It wasn't your fault.

17:27.900 --> 17:32.098
Hi. Mr. McGuinty told me
you found my turkey. Where is he?

17:33.140 --> 17:35.290
She killed him.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.659
You killed Timothy?

17:37.860 --> 17:39.259
I'm sorry.

17:39.460 --> 17:42.532
I threw him out the window
because I thought he could fly.

17:43.060 --> 17:45.528
What are you, an idiot?

17:46.540 --> 17:50.374
I raised him from an egg.
We won a 4-H ribbon together.

17:50.580 --> 17:52.013
I'm really sorry.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.692
It's not fair.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.494
I wanted to kill him.

18:00.060 --> 18:03.211
I didn't even get to chop off
his head.

18:04.380 --> 18:05.813
Well, it-

18:06.180 --> 18:09.889
Hey, it wasn't much fun. I mean,
he didn't run around or anything.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.776
Ladies and gentlemen.

18:12.980 --> 18:14.652
Marcy.

18:22.580 --> 18:24.457
I got my pie.

18:24.660 --> 18:27.220
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to enjoy it.

18:27.700 --> 18:31.295
Al, we had a horrible Thanksgiving.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.933
I killed my pet turkey.

18:33.140 --> 18:35.131
I forgot to reserve a turkey.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.092
I didn't get to eat turkey.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.734
I saw Ms. Piggy's woo-woo.

18:42.340 --> 18:44.900
I mean- I mean, we're starving.

18:45.940 --> 18:47.373
Are you kidding me?

18:47.580 --> 18:50.014
Do you know what I had to go through
to get this pie?

18:51.060 --> 18:52.698
Al.

18:55.060 --> 18:56.937
How could you leave without me?

18:57.140 --> 18:59.256
You weren't in the car?

19:00.140 --> 19:01.653
No.

19:01.860 --> 19:04.533
Do you know how hard it is
for a bloody black man...

19:04.740 --> 19:07.698
...to get a cab on Thanksgiving?

19:07.900 --> 19:11.336
I'm sorry, buddy. Thanks a lot
for running interference for me.

19:11.540 --> 19:13.212
Well, if you really wanna thank me...

19:13.420 --> 19:15.376
...you can just give me
a piece of that pie.

19:15.580 --> 19:18.413
No, no. It's a Thanksgiving tradition.

19:18.620 --> 19:21.009
No, I never share my pie.

19:21.220 --> 19:24.895
Al, I think Aunt Maddie
would want you to share.

19:25.100 --> 19:28.410
<i>Peg, the only thing I'm sharing
is this Thanksgiving wish for all of you:</i>

19:28.620 --> 19:30.497
Get out.

19:33.140 --> 19:35.495
<i>Al Bundy.</i>

19:38.020 --> 19:39.897
<i>Down here, boy.</i>

19:41.940 --> 19:42.929
Aunt Maddie?

19:45.780 --> 19:49.056
Al Bundy, what did I always say?

19:49.260 --> 19:52.696
" If you want that cookie,
you gotta pay for it"?

19:53.900 --> 19:55.049
No, the other thing.

19:55.260 --> 19:58.218
" My pies are always sweeter
when you share 'em"?

19:58.740 --> 19:59.934
Right.

20:00.140 --> 20:03.212
Now, you share that pie
with your family and friends.

20:03.420 --> 20:06.014
Don't make me hit you
upside the head.

20:09.780 --> 20:14.137
Come on, Al, it's Thanksgiving.
Share with us.

20:16.820 --> 20:18.890
No.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.495
<i>Al Bundy.</i>

20:25.340 --> 20:27.171
Okay.

20:28.980 --> 20:32.336
- Anybody wanna share my pie?
- Yes. Thank you, Daddy.

20:32.540 --> 20:34.895
- Al, I knew you'd come through.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.533
<i>Good boy.</i>

20:36.780 --> 20:39.499
<i>Happy Thanksgiving, Aunt Maddie.</i>

20:45.980 --> 20:48.619
<i>Don't go away. We'll be right back.</i>

20:50.460 --> 20:53.736
Wow, JB, I can't believe
that you got smoked by Al Bundy.

20:53.940 --> 20:57.171
I mean, my God, the man's
a middle-aged shoe salesman.

20:57.380 --> 20:59.655
Guys, let's check this out
and go to the replay.

20:59.860 --> 21:00.815
Let's do it.

21:01.380 --> 21:03.940
<i>Hey, check out the missed tackle
by Ms. Eunetta.</i>

21:04.140 --> 21:06.051
<i>Now, that's just sloppy.</i>

21:06.260 --> 21:09.297
<i>Now Bundy heads for daylight.
Oh, and who's there to stop him?</i>

21:09.500 --> 21:14.335
<i>That's right. Our own James
"Fold up Lik e a Blank et" Brown.</i>

21:14.580 --> 21:18.095
<i>Where's the flag? I told you
they should bring back instant replay.</i>

21:18.300 --> 21:22.771
<i>Man, he ran over you
lik e a woman in a shoe sale.</i>

21:22.980 --> 21:25.016
I'll tell you what,
it looked like Al Bundy...

21:25.220 --> 21:27.097
...wanted it
just a little more than you.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.458
Wait a minute.
Who asked you, four eyes?

21:31.660 --> 21:33.969
Is he talking to me?
You want some of me, Harvard?

21:34.180 --> 21:36.455
Hey, hold on. Come on.
Let's just get along here-

21:36.660 --> 21:37.934
- Stay out of it, baldy.
- Stay out of it, baldy.

21:38.140 --> 21:39.209
What are we-?
