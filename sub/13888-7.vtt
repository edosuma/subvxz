00:39.986 --> 00:42.454
- What is that thing?
- Astroglacier.

00:42.622 --> 00:46.183
Allotropically modified, surrounded
by an envelope of luminous gasses.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.454
Thanks! That's most helpful.

00:49.629 --> 00:52.496
- What is it?
- To you, a big iceberg.

00:52.666 --> 00:56.796
I studied them in the Corps,
but I've never seen one up close.

00:56.970 --> 01:01.464
Isn't it incredible? Look at those
crystalline formations. They're faberoo!

01:02.142 --> 01:05.168
You think sciencey stuff's
really interesting, don't you?

01:05.345 --> 01:10.009
I bet at school you always had the right
pencils and impossibly neat handwriting.

01:10.183 --> 01:15.815
I bet you can tell us the average rainfall
of the oil-rich lowlands of Venezuela.

01:15.989 --> 01:18.184
No, I couldn't. I've no idea.

01:19.192 --> 01:21.183
OK, 3.4 inches. So what?

01:22.696 --> 01:24.789
Unlike you, my greatest accomplishment

01:24.965 --> 01:29.402
isn't a line on a loo wall
marking my highest-ever pee.

01:29.569 --> 01:33.733
I'll have you know, ma'am,
I too possess qualifications.

01:33.907 --> 01:36.967
What qualifications have you got,
meat-tenderiser-head?

01:37.144 --> 01:39.544
I'm a fully qualified Bachelor of Sanitation.

01:39.713 --> 01:43.809
You may not know this, sir,
but I completed my course at Toilet University,

01:43.984 --> 01:46.384
where I studied the lavatorial sciences.

01:47.654 --> 01:50.953
Toilet University's a piece of software,
part of your core program.

01:51.124 --> 01:55.584
I had a written examination to indicate
the program was successfully installed.

01:55.762 --> 02:00.756
It was most interesting. Did you know that
the first siphon and valve flushing system

02:00.934 --> 02:04.165
was patented in 1778 by Joseph Bramah,

02:04.337 --> 02:06.805
whose U-bend curvature equations are still...

02:06.973 --> 02:08.463
- Kryten.
- Yes, sir?

02:08.642 --> 02:12.339
Can this story maybe wait?
Ideally, until after I'm dead.

02:12.512 --> 02:16.039
Speaking personally, I hardly didn't get
no formal education at all.

02:16.216 --> 02:18.946
- No kidding, Professor.
- No, it's true, bud.

02:19.119 --> 02:23.351
That's why sometimes I don't know stuff,
like... well, practically everything.

02:23.523 --> 02:28.620
- Is it because you brought yourself up, sir?
- Right. I had to teach myself.

02:28.795 --> 02:33.357
And as I didn't know anything to begin with,
lessons were long and slow,

02:33.533 --> 02:36.127
especially on Thursdays
when I had double nothing.

02:36.303 --> 02:39.329
So what do we do about the ice?

02:39.506 --> 02:41.736
Well, water supplies are low, ma'am.

02:41.908 --> 02:44.638
If the ice is uncontaminated,
it might prove useful.

02:44.811 --> 02:49.180
- OK, standard SEP scan and log.
- Locking on. Scanning and logging.

02:51.318 --> 02:52.751
Extraordinary.

02:52.919 --> 02:56.548
- What is it?
- Something's buried in the astroglacier.

02:56.723 --> 03:01.023
Some kind of object.
It's huge. Just processing.

03:01.194 --> 03:04.186
- Well?
- It's a starship.

03:11.705 --> 03:16.074
This place is harder to get into
than an airline chicken Kiev!

03:24.317 --> 03:28.549
It's the Leviathan, sir,
a 23rd-century JMC supply ship.

03:28.722 --> 03:30.713
Engines are dead, power overload.

03:30.891 --> 03:34.850
Looks like they were running from something.
Wait! I'm picking up a life sign.

03:35.028 --> 03:37.326
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Certain.

03:39.699 --> 03:42.224
I've never seen anything like this!

03:42.402 --> 03:45.633
You weren't around
for my last party, were you?

03:45.805 --> 03:50.265
Look at their twisted, tortured faces!
The sheer blind terror.

03:50.443 --> 03:53.003
- (SCREAMS) Oh, my God!
- What is it?!

03:53.179 --> 03:57.343
The back of my neck!
Great big gob of ice water!

03:57.517 --> 04:01.248
It was horrible!
Went right down into my crevice.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.291
Hey, guys, check this out!

04:16.269 --> 04:18.260
There's a woman in there!

04:19.805 --> 04:22.172
Just locating her JMC ident chip.

04:24.878 --> 04:29.713
Caroline Carmen. According to the psi-scan,
she was once a supply officer on Red Dwarf.

04:29.883 --> 04:33.341
I remember her. She got reposted at Titan.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.545
- You knew her?
- She fancied me.

04:35.722 --> 04:38.987
I don't believe you.
A supply officer and you?

04:39.159 --> 04:44.995
She did, actually. In fact, me and Karen
had a thing going there for a long time.

04:45.165 --> 04:46.723
Caroline.

04:46.900 --> 04:50.836
Caroline, yeah. Karen's my pet name for her.

04:51.004 --> 04:54.462
- I don't believe a word.
- Caroline Carmen and me, believe it.

04:54.641 --> 04:57.405
Sexually, we were just so compatible.

04:57.577 --> 05:02.674
While I was dating her, the women in the
quarters next door called her Carmen Moans.

05:02.849 --> 05:06.148
- You could ask her if she was alive.
- She is, sir.

05:06.319 --> 05:08.844
The life sign is coming from this very spot.

05:09.022 --> 05:13.891
Is it? Well, she might not remember me
immediately. She might have amnesia.

05:14.761 --> 05:17.491
- Amnesia?
- Yeah, ice does that. Gives you amnesia.

05:17.664 --> 05:20.030
- Right, Kryts?
- I don't recall hearing that, sir.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.259
See? It's affecting him already.

05:22.969 --> 05:25.563
OK, let's get her back to the Bug.

05:34.381 --> 05:37.509
I've begun water siphoning
from the Leviathan. Any change here?

05:37.684 --> 05:41.950
No, bud. The ice won't melt,
and this room's hotter than English beer.

05:42.122 --> 05:44.852
He's right.
The temperature's been a constant 90 degrees,

05:45.025 --> 05:47.858
and yet she's still
completely cold and unresponsive.

05:48.028 --> 05:50.223
What about Miss Carmen?

05:52.399 --> 05:54.390
I was talking about Miss Carmen.

05:54.567 --> 05:58.230
It's as if the body's
generating the ice as protection.

05:58.405 --> 06:00.396
Maybe we should just laser it?

06:00.573 --> 06:04.703
Recommend we wait until chemical analysis
is completed in the morning, sir.

06:04.878 --> 06:08.075
Hasty lasering could result
in damage to the body.

06:08.248 --> 06:10.614
Do you really think she's still alive?

06:10.784 --> 06:12.115
She must be.

06:47.620 --> 06:49.178
Ah...

07:04.871 --> 07:06.668
Well, well, well...

07:06.840 --> 07:09.570
This is a bit of a turn-up.

07:09.743 --> 07:11.938
You just couldn't stay away, could you?

07:12.112 --> 07:14.103
Hey, what are you doing?

07:15.548 --> 07:17.539
(LAUGHS)

07:18.852 --> 07:21.320
And what makes you so sure I'm interested?

07:21.488 --> 07:25.151
You think you can just jump
in my bed and I'm yours?

07:26.292 --> 07:29.853
Well, as it happens, you're right,
but it was a close thing.

07:31.364 --> 07:35.733
Mmm. It's good
to feel your sweet breath on my neck again.

07:35.902 --> 07:39.394
Smeg! It's Kryten! It's Kryten!

07:39.572 --> 07:42.473
Quick! Quick! In the shower! In the shower!

07:45.111 --> 07:46.510
(GROANS)

07:46.679 --> 07:48.203
Smeg!

07:53.720 --> 07:55.483
- Yeah.
- Are you alone, sir?

07:55.655 --> 07:58.385
- Yeah.
- I just thought I'd dust your quarters.

07:58.558 --> 08:02.324
- It's two o'clock in the morning!
- This is an emergency dust, sir.

08:02.495 --> 08:06.693
My sensors have picked up
vast quantities of dust in this region.

08:06.866 --> 08:10.302
- I'll take the risk, man!
- I can't allow that, sir.

08:13.740 --> 08:16.504
Ah, double bed mode. Hmm...

08:16.676 --> 08:19.440
I'll just, ahem, dust inside your wardrobe...

08:22.182 --> 08:24.343
Under your spare bunk duvet...

08:25.718 --> 08:27.845
Hmm... In your other wardrobe...

08:29.589 --> 08:32.490
Kryten, man, I'm trying to get some kip!

08:32.659 --> 08:35.890
- She's here, isn't she?
- I don't know what you mean.

08:36.062 --> 08:39.361
(SQUEALS) You promised
you wouldn't like her more than me!

08:39.532 --> 08:42.126
Kryten, listen, um...

08:42.302 --> 08:45.760
- Look, it's like...
- It's because she's got a better head.

08:45.939 --> 08:48.271
Not again, man. No! No!

08:48.441 --> 08:50.500
- It is!
- I like your head!

08:50.677 --> 08:55.410
- Not as much as hers!
- What? You've got a great head.

08:55.582 --> 09:01.418
It's attractive, it's functional, it's almost
perfect for carving a Sunday roast!

09:03.456 --> 09:06.391
She's in the shower, isn't she? Isn't she?

09:06.559 --> 09:09.960
- Who?
- Miss Kochanski! Who else? Madam Curie?!

09:10.129 --> 09:13.621
What is all this noise about? I can't sleep!

09:17.170 --> 09:18.694
Forgive me, sir.

09:18.872 --> 09:20.567
Shame mode.

09:20.740 --> 09:22.731
Excuse me, ma'am.

09:25.144 --> 09:27.669
How the hell did you do that?

09:27.847 --> 09:31.578
Of course! You slipped out
through the vent shaft. Brilliant!

09:31.751 --> 09:34.219
- What?
- You're a genius, an absolute genius!

09:34.387 --> 09:36.378
- What are you doing?
- Unbuttoning your shirt.

09:36.556 --> 09:38.683
- Why?
- We've got some unfinished business!

09:38.858 --> 09:41.725
That was a long time ago. Things are different!

09:41.895 --> 09:44.159
Look, he's gone. Don't worry about Kryten.

09:44.330 --> 09:47.163
Get your kit off. I'll find my Batman outfit.

09:47.333 --> 09:50.131
You really believe in being direct, don't you?

09:50.303 --> 09:53.602
Come on, rumpy-pumpy, Kris.
Let's hit the springs!

09:56.576 --> 10:01.980
That's your idea of seduction, is it?
Not if you were the last man alive.

10:02.148 --> 10:05.914
- I am the last man alive.
- I rest my case.

10:08.421 --> 10:11.390
What did I do wrong? What?

10:13.426 --> 10:15.326
Oh, duvet...

10:20.166 --> 10:23.397
Oh, my God! Caroline!
You've really let yourself go.

10:23.569 --> 10:28.006
You're like the before bit
for about 900 Clearasil commercials!

10:29.642 --> 10:31.200
Sorry!

10:34.113 --> 10:35.580
God! Ah!

10:44.724 --> 10:46.988
God! God!

10:47.160 --> 10:48.593
Are you all right, sir?

10:48.761 --> 10:52.219
I've just been molested
by Tutankhamun's horny grandma!

10:52.398 --> 10:56.027
Of course I'm not smeggin' all right!
Eurgh! The taste!

10:56.202 --> 10:59.296
I need to gargle with a Toilet Duck!

10:59.472 --> 11:05.001
She's dead, sir. And, curious, it appears
she's been dead for three million years.

11:05.178 --> 11:09.911
If she's been dead for three million years,
where did the life signs come from?

11:10.083 --> 11:14.315
Good point, sir.
And more to the point, where did they go?

11:14.887 --> 11:16.479
(THUD)

11:18.424 --> 11:22.485
- I feel really lousy.
- Probably just shock. Don't be a baby.

11:22.662 --> 11:26.894
Miss Kochanski, ma'am, your bedside manner
leaves something to be desired.

11:27.066 --> 11:30.229
- Like what?
- Well, like a bedside manner!

11:30.403 --> 11:32.462
You think I'm a hypochondriac?

11:32.638 --> 11:37.837
You're a man, aren't you? You get
the common cold and you think it's malaria.

11:38.011 --> 11:40.377
And women, of course, are different?

11:40.546 --> 11:43.481
They just have a different perspective
on pain, Kryten.

11:43.649 --> 11:49.315
As would you if you had to pour hot wax
on your crotch and rip out half your thatch.

11:49.489 --> 11:52.083
He's right. I hate doing that.

11:52.258 --> 11:54.818
- The tests are complete.
- (LISTER) And?

11:54.994 --> 11:59.931
There's a foreign substance in your blood,
and, well, I recognise the DNA, sir.

12:00.099 --> 12:03.364
- Is that good or bad?
- It's the Epideme virus, sir.

12:03.536 --> 12:06.733
A man-made parasite
created as a rival to the nicotine patch.

12:06.906 --> 12:12.139
Epideme was an intelligent organism, designed
to block neural signals of nicotine craving,

12:12.311 --> 12:17.078
but it also blocked the signals
telling the body it needed blood and oxygen.

12:17.250 --> 12:21.186
Is that why the Carmen chick looked
like a centrefold from "Playzombie"?

12:21.354 --> 12:26.690
Precisely. It's virtually unstoppable.
For the first 48 hours, it consumes its host,

12:26.859 --> 12:30.056
then hijacks the corpse
and looks for a new victim.

12:30.229 --> 12:33.756
When it can't find one,
it freezes the body and waits.

12:33.933 --> 12:37.926
- So the life signs on the Leviathan...
- Didn't belong to Carmen,

12:38.104 --> 12:40.664
but to the parasite inhabiting her body...

12:40.840 --> 12:44.037
which passed to you the moment she... well...

12:44.210 --> 12:46.701
Slipped her mouth-meat down me gullet?

12:47.914 --> 12:50.246
I've been tongue-hockeyed to death!

12:50.416 --> 12:54.682
In 48 hours, I'll be deader
than Saturday night in Salt Lake City!

12:54.854 --> 13:00.656
There is one option, sir. I believe you might
have a chance if you, well... reason with it.

13:00.827 --> 13:04.228
- Reason with what?
- The virus, sir. It is intelligent.

13:04.397 --> 13:08.629
Are your neural circuits picking up
interference from the tumble-drier again?

13:08.801 --> 13:13.738
If we patch in the universal translator,
it might be possible to talk to it.

13:13.906 --> 13:15.339
It's your only chance, sir.

13:16.742 --> 13:21.907
It's a long shot, but if we can reason
with it, we might persuade it to leave.

13:22.081 --> 13:26.916
- Remember, be charming.
- Be charming to my virus. Right.

13:29.489 --> 13:34.449
- Patching in the UT.
- <i>A great big "hi" to all of you out there!</i>

13:34.627 --> 13:37.027
<i>Tonight, Dave Lister,</i>
<i>vending machine sub-operative</i>

13:37.196 --> 13:40.188
<i>and spice food connoisseur,</i>
<i>this is your death!</i>

13:41.100 --> 13:45.332
- <i>Your line.</i>
- We're speaking with the Epideme virus?

13:45.505 --> 13:50.272
<i>Give that man an eyebrow!</i>
<i>Hey, I'm feeling generous. Give him two!</i>

13:50.443 --> 13:52.411
Maybe we should, um... Can I?

13:52.578 --> 13:56.412
<i>Dave, let's run down the rules.</i>
<i>If you win, you live.</i>

13:56.582 --> 14:01.542
<i>If I win, you die</i> -
<i>I take all your knowledge, when I kill you.</i>

14:01.721 --> 14:04.383
You absorb knowledge
from every person you kill?

14:04.557 --> 14:07.526
<i>So killing you</i>
<i>ain't exactly a career highlight.</i>

14:07.693 --> 14:12.562
<i>As a virus, there's not much call for knowing</i>
<i>how to open a bottle with your anus.</i>

14:14.200 --> 14:16.828
How can you justify
killing another living being?

14:17.003 --> 14:22.737
<i>How about that chicken you biryanied</i>
<i>last night? How can you justify killing that?</i>

14:22.909 --> 14:25.173
Me and the chicken, it was different.

14:25.344 --> 14:27.972
<i>How's that, David?</i>

14:28.147 --> 14:30.615
Well, I'm a person. It was a curry.

14:30.783 --> 14:35.914
<i>He died so you could go on living.</i>
<i>Is that so different from what I'm doing?</i>

14:36.088 --> 14:39.251
Of course it is! Totally! I'm a human being.

14:39.425 --> 14:42.758
I have certain qualities
that elevate me above poultry!

14:42.929 --> 14:48.799
- I can think. I can play the guitar.
- Better than a chicken? Are you crazy?

14:48.968 --> 14:52.131
We're losing, sir!
You better move on to another subject.

14:52.305 --> 14:54.671
I'm the last guy alive!

14:54.840 --> 14:59.868
- <i>That gives you more right to exist than me?</i>
- Well, yeah, because...

15:00.046 --> 15:03.538
<i>Time for your species to check out, Davey.</i>
<i>Arrivederci, humies!</i>

15:03.716 --> 15:05.547
Oh!

15:08.387 --> 15:11.117
<i>David, come on.</i>

15:11.290 --> 15:13.884
<i>You've got a virus. It's fatal. It happens.</i>

15:14.060 --> 15:16.028
<i>Doesn't mean we can't be friends.</i>

15:16.195 --> 15:18.186
<i>Don't touch that dial!</i>

15:19.699 --> 15:24.727
Sir, you know how you told us to work
on a solution, no matter how drastic?

15:24.904 --> 15:28.135
- What have you got, Kryts?
- A solution, but, er...

15:28.307 --> 15:29.604
- What?
- It's too drastic.

15:29.775 --> 15:32.039
- Tell.
- Well, what we thought was...

15:32.211 --> 15:34.509
- You see...
- We want to cut off your arm.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.114
- What?!
- I said it was a stupid idea!

15:37.283 --> 15:40.343
- It was your idea!
- Are you saying I'm stupid?

15:42.255 --> 15:46.316
It's our only chance to save you.
It could be worse.

15:46.492 --> 15:50.223
- I could be planning a career in archery?
- You could be dead.

15:50.396 --> 15:52.956
You said you'd consider anything. This is it.

15:53.132 --> 15:59.332
Can I have some details? Something more
inspiring than "Can I hack off your limb?"

15:59.505 --> 16:02.474
The plan is to inject anti-virals
through your body,

16:02.642 --> 16:04.667
forcing Epideme into your arm.

16:04.844 --> 16:07.369
And then you cut it off. Great plan (!)

16:08.314 --> 16:10.305
What choice have I got?

16:10.483 --> 16:16.718
OK, but make it my left arm, OK? 'Cause
my right arm does all my favourite things.

16:16.889 --> 16:19.824
- OK, sir.
- Let's go! Chop-chop!

16:19.992 --> 16:21.516
Sorry.

16:23.896 --> 16:25.386
(WHIZZING)

16:26.899 --> 16:28.890
Injecting anti-virals.

16:29.935 --> 16:33.666
OK, virus heading north.
Grid coordinate 109.4.

16:33.839 --> 16:38.242
- The pancreas.
- 104.2, on my mark. Mark.

16:38.411 --> 16:42.040
And heading for the left shoulder, 309.0.
No, no, no, no!

16:42.214 --> 16:45.308
308! 308!
It's heading away from his left arm.

16:45.484 --> 16:51.252
406.9... 406.8... 406.5...
Virus heading into his right arm.

16:51.424 --> 16:55.121
The right arm! It's our only chance.
Laser bone-saw, sir, quickly!

16:55.294 --> 16:57.285
Amputation mode - cut and cauterise!

16:58.297 --> 17:00.356
(HISSES)

17:04.637 --> 17:06.627
It's not enough.

17:09.342 --> 17:11.333
Still not enough.

17:12.877 --> 17:14.868
Still not enough!

17:15.714 --> 17:17.705
Still not enough.

17:18.584 --> 17:22.281
OK, that's enough.
If this doesn't work, we're out of options.

17:22.454 --> 17:27.757
Whether it works or not,
I'll never touch barbecue wings again!

17:40.573 --> 17:42.063
Aaah!

17:42.675 --> 17:44.404
He's awake!

17:44.577 --> 17:47.307
My left arm... My left arm, I said!

17:47.480 --> 17:51.473
That's my right. What kind of navigation
officer can't tell left from right?

17:51.650 --> 17:54.346
We did our best. I am so sorry.

17:54.520 --> 17:58.980
- Where is it?
- We flushed it into space. We had to.

17:59.158 --> 18:02.491
Oh, my right arm.
I did everything with that arm.

18:02.661 --> 18:06.222
We were inseparable!
At least, I thought we were.

18:07.333 --> 18:10.166
- Mr Lister, sir, you're awake!
- Buddy, you look great!

18:14.707 --> 18:19.167
Oh... You did what you had to do
to save my life.

18:19.345 --> 18:21.472
(WHINES)

18:21.647 --> 18:23.842
You haven't saved my life.

18:24.016 --> 18:28.077
Seven per cent of Epideme's virions
have got back into your body.

18:28.254 --> 18:30.313
They're currently multiplying exponentially.

18:30.489 --> 18:36.291
So, to sum up - all's I've got to look
forward to now is death, zombification

18:36.462 --> 18:39.226
and a quick after-death snog
with you or the Cat?

18:39.398 --> 18:42.959
I've given my arm - my arm - for nothing?

18:43.135 --> 18:45.433
Not nothing, sir! Based on my calculations,

18:45.604 --> 18:48.835
it's bought you
approximately 58 minutes more life.

18:49.008 --> 18:54.139
- What am I gonna do with 58 minutes?
- Have half a juggling lesson?

18:54.313 --> 18:56.304
You're really not helping.

19:19.705 --> 19:22.230
Kryten, he doesn't like them like that.

19:22.408 --> 19:25.741
Ma'am, I've been
with Mr Lister for many years now.

19:25.911 --> 19:30.075
I don't need some judy-come-lately
advising me on his sleeping arrangements.

19:30.249 --> 19:35.653
In my dimension, I cohabited with him.
I know what makes him happy in bed.

19:37.289 --> 19:40.622
So do I. A large packet
of extra-spicy tortilla chips

19:40.793 --> 19:46.322
and a really good horror movie, preferably
featuring kung-fu-fighting lady vampires.

19:46.499 --> 19:49.764
Hey! Old five-fingers has checked out!

19:49.935 --> 19:54.304
- Oh, my God! You mean...
- No, not dead. Checked out. He's gone.

19:54.473 --> 19:58.705
And about 40 pounds of Incinerex
blasting plastic has gone missing.

20:00.813 --> 20:03.873
- You think there could be a connection?
- Come on!

20:14.527 --> 20:17.963
- What are you doing?
- I'm just popping down the corner shop.

20:18.130 --> 20:20.530
- Does anyone want anything?
- Sir, come back.

20:20.699 --> 20:23.167
There's no point returning to the Leviathan.

20:23.335 --> 20:27.601
It's the only way, Kryten.
Get back over there, detonate this stuff

20:27.773 --> 20:29.968
and destroy all traces of the virus.

20:30.142 --> 20:33.669
- At least it won't get to kill me.
- Dave, close the airlock.

20:33.846 --> 20:36.838
- What you're doing is insane.
- She's right.

20:37.016 --> 20:41.214
You've screwed up the ping-pong tournament.
You gonna mess up the yo-yo championships?

20:41.387 --> 20:46.256
Dave, don't! If you go, I'll never speak
to you again as long as you...

20:46.425 --> 20:49.394
Oh, my God! Just how stupid am I?

20:49.562 --> 20:52.861
- According to my calculations, ma'am...
- Kryten, shut up!

21:01.073 --> 21:03.564
<i>Hey, baby, what's this?</i>
<i>The Christmas special?</i>

21:03.742 --> 21:10.614
That's right, man, yeah!
Look what I got you - 40 pounds of Incinerex.

21:10.783 --> 21:13.718
<i>It's macho, but it's not you.</i>
<i>Get what I'm sayin'?</i>

21:13.886 --> 21:18.152
Let's set the timer
for five minutes, shall we?

21:18.324 --> 21:21.122
<i>Er, Dave, hellooo?</i>

21:21.293 --> 21:23.818
<i>(KRYTEN ON RADIO) Leviathan? Come in, sir.</i>

21:23.996 --> 21:27.227
<i>Kryten, get Starbug away from here!</i>
<i>You've got five minutes.</i>

21:27.399 --> 21:32.462
Dave, listen to me.
Dave - my Dave - had a saying...

21:32.638 --> 21:35.300
Even the word "hopeless" has "hope" in it.

21:36.742 --> 21:38.676
Maybe you had to be there?

21:38.844 --> 21:41.745
- <i>What did that mean?</i>
- You can't give up!

21:43.148 --> 21:48.609
<i>I'm dead already. Use your eyes. I look worse</i>
<i>than the Grim Reaper's passport photo.</i>

21:49.521 --> 21:53.082
Give us more time.
The medicomp might still find an antidote.

21:53.258 --> 21:57.820
<i>There's no point.</i>
<i>Look, I haven't made a will, but, Kris...</i>

21:57.997 --> 22:02.434
<i>under my bunk... I want you to have</i>
<i>the collection of songs I wrote about you.</i>

22:02.601 --> 22:04.899
- Collection?
- <i>Well, three.</i>

22:05.070 --> 22:07.732
<i>There's only two things</i>
<i>that rhyme with "Kochanski".</i>

22:07.906 --> 22:10.704
<i>I used "underpantski" twice.</i>

22:10.876 --> 22:17.042
<i>Kryten, to you I leave all my laundry.</i>
<i>Hey, keep it clean for me, man.</i>

22:17.216 --> 22:19.810
Oh, sir... you're too generous.

22:21.520 --> 22:26.116
Cat, you can have
anything you want from my wardrobe.

22:26.291 --> 22:30.125
I can? Great! I need some hangers!

22:35.834 --> 22:37.927
60 seconds left, Epideme.

22:38.103 --> 22:42.767
<i>Dave, your heart says blow</i>
<i>but your brain says no.</i>

22:42.941 --> 22:48.743
<i>You're no quitter. The crew of this ship</i>
<i>searched for a solution right until the end!</i>

22:48.914 --> 22:51.007
- <i>They never gave up.</i>
- They didn't?

22:51.183 --> 22:55.620
<i>Hell, no! They even overloaded their engines.</i>

22:55.788 --> 22:59.724
<i>So sad... because they were so near.</i>

22:59.892 --> 23:04.556
So near. They weren't running
FROM something but TO something.

23:10.936 --> 23:12.460
Son of a gun!

23:14.006 --> 23:16.770
Kryten, man, change of plan!

23:26.351 --> 23:28.376
Sir, I've been meaning to ask,

23:28.554 --> 23:31.717
as you retain specialist knowledge
from each of your victims,

23:31.890 --> 23:37.385
and as we have no gripe, I was wondering
if you'd fill in some gaps in my knowledge?

23:37.563 --> 23:42.660
<i>Sure. Shoot! I'm red hot in quantum</i>
<i>mechanics, molecular biology and TV themes.</i>

23:42.835 --> 23:44.928
<i>Ask me anything.</i>

23:45.104 --> 23:47.368
Very well.

23:47.539 --> 23:51.908
One thing I've always wanted to know,
who on earth was the fourth Marx brother?

23:52.077 --> 23:55.604
<i>Zippo. Easy! Ask me a hard one.</i>

23:55.781 --> 24:01.185
- A hard one?
- <i>A HAAAAAAAARD one! Yeeeaah!</i>

24:02.287 --> 24:07.486
Very well. How could Starbug's drive module
be reconfigured to be made more efficient?

24:09.194 --> 24:11.321
<i>(INHALES)</i>
<i>Re-route the pulse relays via conductors</i>

24:11.497 --> 24:15.991
<i>and transpose all prime numbers</i>
<i>to the energy equation. (EXHALES)</i>

24:16.168 --> 24:20.264
- And that would make Starbug more efficient?
- <i>300 per cent faster!</i>

24:20.439 --> 24:25.775
That's all we needed to know. The Leviathan
was heading for Delta 7 for the Epideme cure,

24:25.944 --> 24:28.412
but by the time we got there, I'd be dead.

24:28.580 --> 24:31.572
Unless we could make the ship go faster.

24:31.750 --> 24:35.618
- And now we can.
- <i>Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bacteria!</i>

24:47.032 --> 24:51.469
- How are we doing?
- Like a speeding bullet in a bat outta hell!

Not a building, not a plant... Nothing.

- <i>I had to make Dave think there was hope.</i>

25:20.666 --> 25:23.499
<i>The planet was flamed to get rid of me,</i>

25:23.669 --> 25:26.536
