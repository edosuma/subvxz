WEBVTT

00:01.314 --> 00:02.984
<i>Who knows what happened to Tabor?</i>

00:03.087 --> 00:04.588
We may never see him again,

00:04.679 --> 00:06.937
but in the meantime, I'm
running his clients.

00:06.953 --> 00:08.220
It's an upgrade that makes your speech

00:08.321 --> 00:10.021
and mannerisms more human.

00:10.122 --> 00:11.857
You go back to the ship and leave?

00:12.210 --> 00:13.466
We're not leaving you behind.

00:13.559 --> 00:15.293
I think of it as leaving
me to move forward.

00:19.031 --> 00:20.732
Ah!

00:20.833 --> 00:22.667
- You killed Nyx.
- Yes.

00:22.768 --> 00:24.006
Why?

00:24.168 --> 00:26.694
Your feelings for her were a weakness.

00:29.927 --> 00:32.462
- I think he wants...
- Ah! You're here.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.458
Perfect.

00:34.999 --> 00:37.334
I need to borrow your
subspace transmitter.

00:37.435 --> 00:39.336
- For what?
- Well, I heard on the news

00:39.437 --> 00:42.494
that hostilities were spreading
to the Cassiar sector.

00:42.869 --> 00:43.953
So?

00:43.978 --> 00:46.315
So Tabor has a safe
house on Cassiar 4.

00:46.371 --> 00:48.438
Is there anything of
value in this house?

00:48.563 --> 00:50.914
There might be one or...
One or two items.

00:51.015 --> 00:53.350
So is it Tabor you're
worried about or his stuff?

00:53.451 --> 00:54.638
What?

00:54.718 --> 00:56.490
No, he was my friend. My mentor...

00:56.587 --> 00:57.994
Your meal ticket.

00:58.019 --> 01:01.758
Hey, that man was like a father to me.

01:02.900 --> 01:05.802
A deadbeat, absent,
super irritable father

01:05.997 --> 01:08.665
who I took care of for five
very long years, by the way.

01:11.185 --> 01:13.553
Might be worth it just
to see what he's up to.

01:15.217 --> 01:17.283
We'll drop out long enough
for you to make the call.

01:17.308 --> 01:18.341
Thanks.

01:21.056 --> 01:22.412
This should be interesting.

01:24.515 --> 01:26.259
Okay.

01:27.650 --> 01:29.235
Don't worry.

01:29.754 --> 01:31.488
I'll take it easy on you.

01:31.589 --> 01:33.323
Okay?

01:33.424 --> 01:34.860
You ready?

01:35.045 --> 01:38.113
Sure.

01:42.133 --> 01:44.668
Okay.

01:44.769 --> 01:46.670
I'm gonna go ahead and say
you're probably more of

01:46.771 --> 01:48.292
an intermediate than a beginner.

01:48.404 --> 01:51.995
I trained
with Four before he...

01:52.844 --> 01:55.378
- Well, before.
- Ah. Okay.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.396
Well, I can take over for
him, if you're interested.

01:59.232 --> 02:01.419
Yeah, I'd like that.

02:01.898 --> 02:05.637
So, uh, where did you learn?

02:06.758 --> 02:08.824
At the monastery where I grew up.

02:08.925 --> 02:11.661
A monastery? Seriously?

02:11.771 --> 02:15.247
I was a Prioress of the
Seventh Order of Chandarith,

02:15.533 --> 02:18.435
under the protection
of the Abbot of Daro.

02:18.536 --> 02:19.870
Wow.

02:19.971 --> 02:21.872
You seem surprised.

02:21.973 --> 02:23.707
It's just a little hard to imagine

02:23.808 --> 02:26.109
how you go from something like
that to being a bodyguard

02:26.210 --> 02:28.911
for someone like Adrian.

02:29.714 --> 02:34.951
Fair enough. I can see how that
might come across as a little odd.

02:35.052 --> 02:36.720
The monks taught us martial arts

02:36.798 --> 02:39.366
to instill self discipline,
self awareness.

02:39.419 --> 02:42.154
For them, it was like
a form of meditation,

02:42.326 --> 02:44.895
so everyone in the order
took a vow to never use

02:44.996 --> 02:47.597
what we'd learned against
another human being.

02:47.651 --> 02:50.386
Not even in self defense.

02:50.535 --> 02:53.922
And in the end, that's
what got them killed.

02:55.940 --> 02:58.281
What happened?

03:07.385 --> 03:10.768
I was on a pilgrimage
to a nearby shrine.

03:11.622 --> 03:13.623
And while I was gone,
some bandits broke into

03:13.724 --> 03:17.471
the temple and stole some
very valuable manuscripts.

03:18.563 --> 03:21.201
They killed everybody inside the place.

03:21.999 --> 03:24.134
I guess they didn't want
to leave any witnesses.

03:26.237 --> 03:27.737
That's horrible.

03:27.839 --> 03:29.172
You know, I must've just missed them

03:29.273 --> 03:30.935
because when I got back,

03:31.037 --> 03:32.938
the bodies were still warm.

03:35.448 --> 03:37.182
What did you do?

03:40.852 --> 03:42.752
I tracked the bandits into the woods.

03:46.290 --> 03:48.045
Then I waited till nightfall,

03:48.104 --> 03:50.561
I snuck into their camps, and
I slit all of their throats

03:50.628 --> 03:52.529
while they were sleeping.

03:58.245 --> 04:01.081
So I guess you can say I broke my vow.

04:18.987 --> 04:20.219
Adrian?

04:20.315 --> 04:22.950
Ambrosia... ah! Thank God you're okay.

04:23.317 --> 04:24.912
What's going on? Where's Tabor?

04:25.014 --> 04:26.655
I don't know, I thought
maybe he was with you.

04:26.699 --> 04:29.000
No. No, if he was here, I
wouldn't be in this mess.

04:29.194 --> 04:30.928
What do you mean?

04:31.046 --> 04:33.947
Well, well.

04:34.128 --> 04:37.029
If it isn't Tabor's little lapdog.

04:37.131 --> 04:39.031
And the crew of the "Raza."

04:39.133 --> 04:40.266
Still slummin' it, I see?

04:40.367 --> 04:41.868
Who the hell...

04:41.969 --> 04:43.703
Goren, what the hell
are you doing there?

04:43.804 --> 04:45.338
<i>Same thing I always do.</i>

04:45.439 --> 04:46.906
Whatever I want.

04:47.007 --> 04:48.741
If you hurt her, I swear...

04:48.842 --> 04:50.176
<i>Relax.</i>

04:50.277 --> 04:51.811
She's fine.

04:51.912 --> 04:54.180
Isn't that right, honey?

04:54.281 --> 04:58.151
<i>And she'll continue to be fine
as long as you cooperate.</i>

04:58.252 --> 04:59.519
If not...

05:02.189 --> 05:04.390
Well, I think you get the idea.

05:19.358 --> 05:21.826
All right, I'm listening.
What do you want?

05:21.927 --> 05:23.828
Tabor recently acquired a data file.

05:23.929 --> 05:26.063
Stolen from a Ferrous military outpost.

05:26.164 --> 05:27.632
How do you know about that?

05:27.733 --> 05:29.634
Don't worry about how I know.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.838
- Worry about this.
- Adrian!

05:33.939 --> 05:35.940
You wanna see her alive again or not?

05:36.041 --> 05:37.697
Yes, yes. I'll do whatever you say.

05:37.759 --> 05:39.830
Look, whoever you are, I don't
know what this is about,

05:39.911 --> 05:42.013
- but if you hurt that woman...
- You mind your own business

05:42.114 --> 05:43.948
if you know what's good for you.

05:44.049 --> 05:47.084
- You're threatening me?
<i>- I'll do more than threaten.</i>

05:47.185 --> 05:49.687
Adrian, bring me the file.

05:49.788 --> 05:51.455
Come alone.

05:51.556 --> 05:53.658
If you try anything,

05:53.751 --> 05:56.552
I'll kill you all.

06:03.001 --> 06:04.902
So what's this all about?

06:05.003 --> 06:07.171
Tabor's girlfriend's been kidnapped.

06:07.272 --> 06:09.740
- Tabor has a girlfriend?
- That's what I said.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.271
He didn't deserve her.

06:11.345 --> 06:14.247
He took her for granted, and
now look what's happened.

06:14.613 --> 06:17.248
You knew she was there, didn't you?

06:17.349 --> 06:20.084
She's the one you're worried about.

06:20.185 --> 06:22.720
- Here's your chance.
- What do you mean?

06:22.821 --> 06:24.288
You ride in there on your white horse,

06:24.389 --> 06:26.724
you save the day. Tabor's
out of the picture.

06:26.825 --> 06:29.160
- You get the girl.
- Seriously?

06:29.261 --> 06:30.895
- Hmm.
- It's not like that.

06:30.996 --> 06:32.630
I just want her to be safe.

06:32.731 --> 06:33.931
Oh.

06:34.032 --> 06:35.433
You really think that could work?

06:35.534 --> 06:37.601
- Is that...
- Seriously?

06:37.703 --> 06:39.804
What do you know about
this guy who took her?

06:39.905 --> 06:41.889
His name's Goren. He's a business rival.

06:41.948 --> 06:43.448
He's been poaching our
clients for years,

06:43.514 --> 06:45.209
but he's never done
anything like this before.

06:45.310 --> 06:46.777
What kind of back-ups he got?

06:46.878 --> 06:48.779
Couple of thugs... Hmm.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.596
But nothing you guys can't handle.

06:50.655 --> 06:53.167
Whoa. I said, "You ride in
there on your white horse."

06:53.318 --> 06:56.190
- Not us.
- I'll pay you.

06:56.788 --> 06:59.623
Do you have the money?

06:59.725 --> 07:01.292
Okay, technically, I'd owe you.

07:01.393 --> 07:03.561
- Hmm.
- Come... come on!

07:03.662 --> 07:05.563
It'll be easy. I-I just need back-up

07:05.664 --> 07:07.164
to make sure he honors the deal.

07:07.265 --> 07:09.333
- What does he want?
- A data file,

07:09.434 --> 07:11.769
which is a little weird because
Tabor said it wasn't important.

07:11.870 --> 07:14.205
- What's on the file?
- Really not much.

07:14.306 --> 07:15.973
I mean, just some blank
requisition forms

07:16.074 --> 07:17.208
and a set of coordinates
for something called

07:17.309 --> 07:18.476
Project Phoenix.

07:18.577 --> 07:20.377
Whoa. Phoenix?

07:20.479 --> 07:23.214
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure. Why?

07:23.315 --> 07:26.217
- Yeah, why?
- Truffault told me about it.

07:26.318 --> 07:28.219
Mikkei intelligence has
been investigating

07:28.320 --> 07:31.222
unconfirmed reports that Ferrous
is building an entire new fleet.

07:31.323 --> 07:33.891
Almost a hundred ships,
cruisers, destroyers...

07:33.992 --> 07:35.559
That's a lot of firepower.

07:35.660 --> 07:38.195
Enough to ensure total victory.

07:40.098 --> 07:43.416
The codename for this
shipyard is Phoenix.

07:45.205 --> 07:47.671
If it's true, every one
of Ferrous' enemies

07:47.773 --> 07:49.073
will pay big for those coordinates.

07:49.174 --> 07:50.474
Even if it wasn't true.

07:50.575 --> 07:53.477
They'd probably pay just to be sure.

07:53.578 --> 07:55.707
You really think it
could be that valuable?

07:55.745 --> 07:58.481
This isn't just about money.

07:58.623 --> 08:02.246
This could turn the tide of the war.

08:03.588 --> 08:05.022
Here's the deal.

08:05.123 --> 08:06.871
Give us the file.

08:06.977 --> 08:08.544
We'll deal with the kidnapping,
and your friend will be safe.

08:08.794 --> 08:10.237
I promise.

08:10.299 --> 08:12.596
Well, to be honest, she's
really more of an acquaintance.

08:12.697 --> 08:14.598
Seriously?

08:14.699 --> 08:17.434
Okay, fine. If you promise
to get her out of there,

08:17.536 --> 08:20.135
- I'll give you the file.
- Great.

08:20.236 --> 08:24.539
There's just one small problem.

08:27.979 --> 08:29.647
All that crap you brought with you.

08:29.748 --> 08:31.549
You didn't have room for
one little data file?

08:31.650 --> 08:32.817
I didn't know it was that important.

08:32.918 --> 08:34.485
If Tabor knew, he never told me.

08:34.586 --> 08:36.635
How do you know he didn't just
take it with him when he left?

08:36.698 --> 08:38.332
Well, he was paranoid about
keeping stolen goods

08:38.357 --> 08:40.019
in his room, so he made
me hold it for him.

08:40.073 --> 08:42.736
It should still be on my hard drive.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.024
What's the latest report on Regulus 12?

08:46.304 --> 08:48.371
Scanning.

08:48.489 --> 08:51.675
According to GNN, Novina
Corp occupied Regulus 12

08:51.742 --> 08:54.691
for a number of days, but
were forced to abandon

08:54.773 --> 08:57.128
the station when their ships
were required elsewhere.

08:57.178 --> 08:58.478
See? Abandoned.

08:58.743 --> 09:00.744
Now this should be a walk in the park.

09:07.485 --> 09:11.655
These figures from the Nakana
asteroid field are disappointing.

09:11.756 --> 09:15.659
Tarium production is down 20%.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.720
It's the miners.

09:17.814 --> 09:20.115
They're demanding better
working conditions.

09:20.223 --> 09:22.057
There's talk of a work stoppage.

09:22.151 --> 09:24.886
We're at war. That's treason.

09:24.987 --> 09:27.322
Have you ever been to the
Tarium mines, general?

09:27.423 --> 09:29.825
Everyone has to make sacrifices.

09:29.926 --> 09:32.260
And what sacrifices
have you made today?

09:32.361 --> 09:35.197
A little less wine with
your lunch, perhaps?

09:39.969 --> 09:42.304
Forgive the intrusion, Emperor.

09:42.405 --> 09:45.064
It's no intrusion.

09:45.408 --> 09:49.878
I have asked Han-Shireikan to return
from the front and rejoin this council.

09:49.979 --> 09:54.883
I only wish my return
brought better news.

09:54.984 --> 09:56.885
General Caius is dead.

09:56.986 --> 09:58.733
His fleet is scattered.

09:58.817 --> 10:01.953
The Temiken system will fall to
our enemies within the week.

10:13.882 --> 10:15.783
Welcome back to Regulus 12.

10:21.844 --> 10:23.745
Oh, shit.

10:33.230 --> 10:36.009
So much for a walk in the park.

10:36.142 --> 10:37.869
What? This isn't my fault.

10:37.893 --> 10:40.795
She said the place was
abandoned, not destroyed.

10:40.896 --> 10:43.464
Evidently, when Novina was
forced to leave the station,

10:43.565 --> 10:45.099
they decided to scuttle it.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.934
Seems a little petty, don't you think?

10:47.035 --> 10:48.903
That's not the point.
This is a dead end.

10:48.972 --> 10:50.873
That file is gone.

10:51.006 --> 10:53.386
Not necessarily.

10:54.009 --> 10:56.042
What are you talking about?

10:56.183 --> 10:57.750
Tabor liked to back up
his files and store them

10:57.851 --> 11:00.419
in a secure facility on Taliphus 8.

11:00.734 --> 11:04.734
Taliphus 8 is located deep in
Ferrous-controlled territory.

11:05.687 --> 11:07.626
Of course it is.

11:07.727 --> 11:10.396
Shuttle us in, and I'll gain
access using my station ID.

11:10.497 --> 11:12.231
Tabor used to send me all the time.

11:12.332 --> 11:14.633
The head of security was
practically on his payroll.

11:14.734 --> 11:16.135
- Us?
- Hmm?

11:16.236 --> 11:20.325
Hmm? You said, "Shuttle us in."

11:21.223 --> 11:23.075
Right. Yeah. Five's gonna
have to come with.

11:25.845 --> 11:27.479
I can get into the storage unit,

11:27.581 --> 11:29.148
but I'm going to need someone to hack in

11:29.249 --> 11:31.083
so I can access the safety deposit box,

11:31.184 --> 11:33.252
and from what I understand,
she does that sort of thing.

11:33.353 --> 11:34.920
- Right?
- Thought you said

11:35.021 --> 11:37.364
Tabor sent you there all the time?

11:37.857 --> 11:39.191
He did.

11:39.292 --> 11:42.060
With a new code every time.

11:43.129 --> 11:46.031
Seriously. Nothing to worry about.

11:46.132 --> 11:48.534
- It'll...
- Be a walk in the park?

11:48.635 --> 11:51.370
More of a light jog.

11:55.609 --> 11:56.875
Need you to keep an eye on him.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.277
Make sure he doesn't screw up,

11:58.378 --> 11:59.763
or try to work some sort of side angle.

11:59.818 --> 12:01.584
You really think he'd
try to double-cross us?

12:01.648 --> 12:03.148
He learned from Tabor, didn't he?

12:06.253 --> 12:07.853
I should be coming with you.

12:07.954 --> 12:09.321
You'd just be waiting
in the docking bay.

12:09.422 --> 12:10.990
- There's no point.
- As a precaution.

12:12.792 --> 12:14.093
I'm tired of standing by

12:14.194 --> 12:15.761
and letting everyone take care of me.

12:15.862 --> 12:17.863
I want to do this, okay?

12:21.501 --> 12:23.068
- Okay.
- Thank you.

12:25.805 --> 12:28.207
Besides, I don't think the
others trust you yet.

12:28.308 --> 12:31.543
- Oh, it's me they don't trust?
- It's your manner.

12:31.645 --> 12:33.379
It puts people off.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.381
You should try smiling more.

12:48.228 --> 12:51.030
No warships in the area.

12:51.131 --> 12:54.133
Marauder, you're good to go.

13:13.420 --> 13:14.887
Nemec, old buddy. It's been a while.

13:14.988 --> 13:16.422
Adrian.

13:16.523 --> 13:17.656
Adrian's friend.

13:20.226 --> 13:21.460
What... what the hell?

13:21.561 --> 13:22.861
You're under arrest.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.367
You can't afford to hesitate.

13:28.468 --> 13:29.868
You have to send reinforcements

13:29.969 --> 13:33.272
to the Temiken system immediately.

13:33.373 --> 13:36.542
- It's not that simple.
- It's necessary.

13:36.643 --> 13:40.179
I don't have the ships!

13:40.280 --> 13:41.580
Then find them.

13:41.681 --> 13:43.349
And weaken my position elsewhere?

13:43.450 --> 13:45.751
That is exactly what our
enemies are hoping for.

13:45.852 --> 13:48.821
Temiken is the birthplace of Ishida,

13:48.922 --> 13:51.090
the original capital of the empire,

13:51.191 --> 13:54.526
and it's still the spiritual
home of our people.

13:54.627 --> 13:56.695
It is exposed.

13:56.796 --> 13:58.697
It requires too many
resources to defend,

13:58.798 --> 14:00.733
and it has no strategic value.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.735
There's more to winning
wars than strategy.

14:06.239 --> 14:09.575
You have to win the people.

14:09.676 --> 14:11.143
The people obey.

14:11.244 --> 14:12.478
Because they fear you.

14:12.579 --> 14:14.913
And that's fine in peacetime

14:15.014 --> 14:16.482
when all you need for them to do

14:16.583 --> 14:19.485
is follow the rules and pay their taxes.

14:19.586 --> 14:22.921
But now, you're asking
them to make sacrifices.

14:23.022 --> 14:24.323
For you.

14:24.424 --> 14:27.993
For the empire.

14:28.094 --> 14:29.995
You are the empire now.

14:32.499 --> 14:35.401
Give them something to believe in.

14:35.502 --> 14:37.069
Inspire them.

14:37.170 --> 14:40.706
And they will follow you
to the ends of the galaxy.

14:51.895 --> 14:53.796
What the hell is this? I
thought we had an arrangement.

14:53.844 --> 14:57.080
We did, but your boss has
fallen behind on his payments.

14:57.390 --> 14:59.324
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.

14:59.349 --> 15:01.720
Yeah, it is. What with the war
and things being crazy...

15:01.784 --> 15:05.119
And you're here with the
cash to make things right?

15:05.275 --> 15:08.577
What... well, not exactly.

15:08.835 --> 15:10.936
I'm gonna... I'm gonna level with you.

15:11.037 --> 15:14.139
Tabor's gone, and he cleared out
all his accounts before he left.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.008
Hmm.

15:16.109 --> 15:18.067
Then you got a problem.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.685
I have friends in the
Intelligence Division,

15:20.825 --> 15:23.291
and I know they know
Tabor was working with

15:23.316 --> 15:26.819
the crew of the "Raza,"
and rumor has it,

15:26.920 --> 15:29.259
you're running the business now.

15:29.689 --> 15:32.057
I've got some very interesting
prospects lined up.

15:32.158 --> 15:33.859
I just need a little time.

15:34.556 --> 15:35.798
I'll tell you what.

15:35.853 --> 15:38.755
I got a better idea. You
wanna pay off the debt?

15:38.965 --> 15:40.866
Tell me about the "Raza."

15:45.972 --> 15:49.942
Uh, I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

15:50.043 --> 15:51.944
Oh, Adrian.

15:52.045 --> 15:54.223
Central wants these people bad.

15:54.341 --> 15:57.810
As soon as your ID popped
up, I had to call it in.

15:57.911 --> 15:59.812
Cruiser's already on its way.

16:08.021 --> 16:09.922
This is taking too long.
Something's wrong.

16:10.023 --> 16:13.859
Simple. Either he screwed
up or he screwed us over.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.061
<i>Marauder, come in.</i>

16:16.162 --> 16:18.063
- Go ahead.
<i>- I just intercepted</i>

16:18.164 --> 16:19.698
<i>a communication from the station.</i>

16:19.799 --> 16:22.701
They filed an arrest
report for Adrian Maro.

16:22.802 --> 16:24.125
Screwed up.

16:24.164 --> 16:25.172
What about Five?

16:25.211 --> 16:28.131
<i>There's no mention of her in the
report,</i> but given our notoriety,

16:28.156 --> 16:30.265
it's only a matter of time
before she's identified.

16:30.593 --> 16:32.267
Are there any Ferrous
ships in the vicinity?

16:32.695 --> 16:34.712
<i>No. It's still clear.</i>

16:34.829 --> 16:36.227
But that could change.

16:36.775 --> 16:39.006
All right. We're going in after them.

16:41.681 --> 16:45.148
- I have another idea.
- I'm listening.

16:45.173 --> 16:47.749
I just need to hack into
the station's date node.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.665
And unpack those heels I
picked up from Safira-10.

17:09.638 --> 17:12.207
Hi, cutie.

17:12.308 --> 17:16.537
Client number 3664297.

17:18.607 --> 17:20.407
Please let me take your facial recog.

17:20.492 --> 17:22.493
Oh, sure, honey.

17:22.522 --> 17:25.092
I just need to get a scan of
those beautiful baby browns.

17:25.193 --> 17:27.094
Sure.

17:31.085 --> 17:32.432
Welcome back, Ms. Devereaux.

17:32.533 --> 17:33.934
Thank you.

17:34.035 --> 17:35.769
Um?

17:35.870 --> 17:37.719
- Ellis.
- Ellis.

17:38.606 --> 17:40.941
Allow me to escort you to
your safety deposit unit.

17:41.042 --> 17:43.406
Well, aren't you just the sweetest thing

17:43.547 --> 17:44.981
I ever did see.

17:49.984 --> 17:52.452
So I don't see a ring. Can
I assume that you're...

17:52.553 --> 17:54.351
Free and happy.

17:54.989 --> 17:56.556
So not looking to get tied down?

17:56.657 --> 17:59.156
Oh, why? You offerin'?

17:59.894 --> 18:01.728
I've been working on my knots.

18:01.829 --> 18:03.930
You cheeky devil.

18:06.634 --> 18:08.335
You know, why don't we go
out for a drink sometime?

18:08.436 --> 18:09.736
- I know this place...
- Oh.

18:09.837 --> 18:12.172
Unfortunately, I can't.

18:12.273 --> 18:15.175
- Why not?
- Well, it's just...

18:17.278 --> 18:19.613
I don't date guys whose
asses I've kicked.

18:22.150 --> 18:23.717
Hmm.

18:23.818 --> 18:26.386
Okay, okay. Let's focus on the plan.

18:26.487 --> 18:28.054
What plan?

18:28.156 --> 18:29.890
Our escape plan.

18:29.991 --> 18:32.292
Come on, this can't be the first
time you've been captured.

18:32.393 --> 18:36.129
Well, no. I guess it's more
like my seventh or eighth.

18:36.230 --> 18:40.160
Right. So you've had experience
in these types of situations.

18:40.902 --> 18:43.003
Never mind. I got it. Oh, this...

18:43.104 --> 18:44.671
This is brilliant. One of us...

18:44.772 --> 18:46.273
Both: Pretends to be sick.

18:46.374 --> 18:49.075
- Yeah.
- No, that's a terrible plan.

18:49.177 --> 18:50.944
Okay. Then, uh,

18:51.045 --> 18:54.381
- you... you hack the console.
- He took my kit.

18:54.482 --> 18:57.717
Hey, show a little
resourcefulness, okay?

18:57.819 --> 18:59.119
I can't be expected to do everything.

18:59.220 --> 19:01.721
Come up with the plan and execute it?

19:01.823 --> 19:04.991
Uh, okay, so I'll hack that door console

19:05.092 --> 19:08.728
without my tools, and then what?

19:08.830 --> 19:11.731
Then... then we make a
break for the Marauder.

19:11.833 --> 19:13.834
Past all the armed guards?

19:13.935 --> 19:16.503
Why so negative, hmm?

19:22.743 --> 19:26.313
- Had time to think about it?
- Think about what?

19:26.414 --> 19:29.680
Here's the offer. You
give up the "Raza,"

19:29.939 --> 19:32.841
you walk out of here a free man.

19:34.789 --> 19:36.726
<i>Sir, we're got a problem on level three.</i>

19:36.802 --> 19:38.528
Not now, I'm busy.

19:38.624 --> 19:42.026
<i>It's Corporal Klugman, sir.
He missed his check-in.</i>

19:42.401 --> 19:44.135
Send someone down to find him.

19:44.298 --> 19:46.032
And if he's drunk again, he's fired.

19:46.133 --> 19:48.034
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

19:50.538 --> 19:52.575
So what's it gonna be?

19:52.974 --> 19:56.476
I'm sure as hell Tabor
would take the deal.

19:56.577 --> 19:59.513
Something. One of the crew.

20:03.251 --> 20:04.985
Well, I'm not Tabor.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.991
<i>Sir, we've got a
disturbance on level four.</i>

20:09.068 --> 20:11.402
<i>C-squad is not responding.</i>

20:11.521 --> 20:14.023
- Send in backup.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

20:16.629 --> 20:19.764
The cruiser's gonna be here
any minute now, Adrian.

20:19.897 --> 20:22.132
This is your last chance.

20:22.201 --> 20:24.969
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.674
Sir, we've got another alert.

20:26.768 --> 20:27.834
<i>Level five.</i>

20:29.577 --> 20:32.256
Hmm. Isn't that this level?

20:32.645 --> 20:35.947
Sergeant, what the hell's going on?

20:36.284 --> 20:39.019
Sergeant?

20:53.402 --> 20:55.854
Hi.

20:56.070 --> 20:57.804
I'm their lift.

21:04.986 --> 21:06.887
Got it.

21:10.064 --> 21:11.698
Aw, give me a break.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.947
It's gone.

21:23.486 --> 21:24.581
Finally.

21:24.621 --> 21:26.667
This wild goose chase is over.

21:34.497 --> 21:37.266
What about Ambrosia?

21:37.367 --> 21:41.170
- Uh, what about her?
- They're gonna kill her.

21:41.271 --> 21:43.939
It's not our job to run around
the galaxy risking our asses

21:44.040 --> 21:46.484
- to rescue people.
- I'm sorry I screwed up,

21:46.562 --> 21:48.711
but please don't let it
cost Ambrosia her life.

21:48.812 --> 21:52.114
Back me up here, Boss Lady.

21:52.215 --> 21:55.117
Bellerophon 6!

21:55.218 --> 21:56.719
Is that supposed to mean something?

21:56.820 --> 21:58.575
It's where you'll find that data file.

21:58.669 --> 21:59.719
How do you know that?

22:00.036 --> 22:03.191
The only other person in the galaxy who
could've accessed that box was Tabor.

22:03.216 --> 22:04.732
He's the one who cleaned it out.

22:04.828 --> 22:07.443
Yeah, because he was planning
to disappear, which he did.

22:07.615 --> 22:09.066
How does that help us?

22:09.121 --> 22:10.822
A couple of months ago, I was
going through some papers

22:10.923 --> 22:12.857
and I found a purchase
agreement for a compound

22:12.882 --> 22:14.783
in the Bellerophon system.
When I asked him about it,

22:14.835 --> 22:17.597
he got mad and told me
to mind my own business.

22:17.681 --> 22:20.250
- So?
- I handled everything for him.

22:20.460 --> 22:23.629
The man made me buy his underwear.

22:23.762 --> 22:26.864
Why keep this one thing secret?

22:27.015 --> 22:29.083
Unless he was looking
for a place to hide

22:29.184 --> 22:31.919
where no one would find him.

22:32.020 --> 22:33.921
That's not a lot to go on.

22:34.022 --> 22:35.422
Look, it makes sense.

22:35.523 --> 22:37.491
He was paranoid about the war.

22:37.592 --> 22:40.971
And Bellerophon 6 is
an independent colony.

22:41.116 --> 22:43.017
Neutral territory.

22:49.180 --> 22:51.481
You still want that file, right?

22:59.292 --> 23:00.690
Emperor!

23:00.792 --> 23:03.330
- I need a moment of your time.
- I'm busy. It'll have to wait.

23:03.463 --> 23:05.823
It can't wait.

23:06.900 --> 23:09.635
You forget yourself, Han-Shireikan?

23:09.736 --> 23:11.637
Don't let the fact that I've allowed you

23:11.738 --> 23:13.839
back in my presence get to your head,

23:13.940 --> 23:17.476
or you might find it quickly
removed from your shoulders.

23:17.577 --> 23:21.513
I don't regret what I
did, as I still believe

23:21.629 --> 23:25.278
that it was in the best
interest of my emperor.

23:26.919 --> 23:28.830
But I do regret that in my absence,

23:28.855 --> 23:31.757
you started taking military
advice from a schoolteacher.

23:41.237 --> 23:43.671
No one wants to see Temiken fall.

23:45.389 --> 23:47.290
But we don't have a choice.

23:50.795 --> 23:54.131
Many see it as the heart of the Empire.

23:54.232 --> 23:56.221
And we'll take it back.

23:57.101 --> 23:59.002
When the time is right.

24:16.721 --> 24:19.022
Tabor, if you're here, come out.

24:19.123 --> 24:21.024
We need to talk.

24:28.166 --> 24:30.901
The file's definitely gotta
be in here somewhere.

24:31.009 --> 24:34.244
Great. Let's tear this place apart.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.432
Yeah. Okay.

24:43.343 --> 24:46.078
Lenari death mask.

24:46.250 --> 24:47.884
And plenty of plain old cash.

24:47.985 --> 24:49.486
It's quite the hoard.

24:49.587 --> 24:51.154
It kind of makes you
wonder why he doesn't have

24:51.255 --> 24:52.889
a better security system.

24:52.990 --> 24:55.125
Yeah. I was just
thinking the same thing.

24:59.430 --> 25:01.331
Force field. Okay.

25:01.432 --> 25:03.200
This is as far as we go.

25:08.973 --> 25:11.875
This wasn't here a second ago.

25:11.976 --> 25:14.311
We're trapped.

25:17.415 --> 25:18.949
Who the hell are you?

25:19.050 --> 25:21.117
I possess no personal designation.

25:21.219 --> 25:24.554
I am the security android assigned
to protect this facility.

25:24.655 --> 25:26.089
Well, here's the thing.

25:26.190 --> 25:29.492
I work for your owner, Tabor.

25:29.594 --> 25:31.161
It's okay for me to be here.

25:31.262 --> 25:33.196
Do you have the password?

25:33.297 --> 25:35.031
Uh, no.

25:35.132 --> 25:37.868
Then it is not okay for you to be here.

25:37.969 --> 25:39.536
What are you gonna do with us?

25:39.637 --> 25:40.997
You will not be harmed.

25:41.043 --> 25:44.803
I'm under strict instructions to detain
any intruders until Tabor returns.

25:45.309 --> 25:47.544
Okay. Any idea when that might be?

25:47.645 --> 25:48.778
No.

25:49.981 --> 25:52.089
When was the last time he was in touch?

25:52.216 --> 25:54.551
Three months, 12 days,
and six hours ago.

25:54.652 --> 25:56.553
Please,

25:56.654 --> 25:58.221
make yourselves comfortable.

25:58.322 --> 26:00.223
You may be here a while.

26:03.861 --> 26:05.395
Great.

26:05.496 --> 26:06.897
Yeah.

26:18.254 --> 26:20.155
Thought you like to change
back into robot mode

26:20.256 --> 26:22.690
- when you're on the ship.
- Not yet.

26:28.264 --> 26:29.731
Suit yourself.

26:31.834 --> 26:33.234
This is a mistake.

26:33.335 --> 26:34.669
What are you talking about?

26:37.439 --> 26:39.440
If that security android
is a defense model,

26:39.542 --> 26:40.822
he'll be even tougher than I am.

26:40.847 --> 26:42.775
And I had no trouble kicking your ass.

26:42.812 --> 26:45.113
- You remember that, right?
- Yeah. I remember.

26:45.214 --> 26:48.116
- You got a better idea?
- Yeah.

26:48.217 --> 26:49.517
I think I do.

26:52.054 --> 26:54.622
- I'm telling you.
- Tabor knows me.

26:54.723 --> 26:56.958
There's gotta be some way of
getting in touch with him.

26:57.059 --> 26:58.526
I have attempted to contact him

26:58.627 --> 27:00.395
on all the transmission
channels he provided.

27:00.496 --> 27:01.564
There was no response.

27:01.642 --> 27:05.145
He could be dead for all we know.

27:05.564 --> 27:07.465
Someone else has entered the building.

27:16.114 --> 27:18.615
I'm unarmed.

27:18.810 --> 27:20.711
I didn't come here to fight.

27:20.812 --> 27:22.713
You should not have come here at all.

27:24.316 --> 27:25.883
I didn't have much of a choice.

27:25.984 --> 27:27.551
I'm here to rescue my friends.

27:27.653 --> 27:28.886
That's unfortunate.

27:28.916 --> 27:30.884
I have my orders.

27:31.064 --> 27:32.965
What? To protect all this stuff?

27:33.058 --> 27:34.845
It is very important to my employer.

27:34.947 --> 27:37.448
He stressed that repeatedly.

27:37.550 --> 27:39.450
Tabor doesn't care about you.

27:39.552 --> 27:41.352
That is irrelevant.

27:41.453 --> 27:43.354
Tabor may not even ever come back.

27:43.455 --> 27:46.537
You could spend the rest of your
existence just here, waiting.

27:46.747 --> 27:48.922
That is also irrelevant.

27:52.765 --> 27:56.189
You have the potential
to be so much more.

27:56.669 --> 27:59.003
More what?

28:01.941 --> 28:04.008
You can hear my heart beating, right?

28:04.109 --> 28:06.211
Of course.

28:06.312 --> 28:08.079
What about now?

28:10.912 --> 28:12.746
How did you do that?

28:12.918 --> 28:15.439
Simulation.

28:15.921 --> 28:17.655
I'm just like you.

28:17.756 --> 28:20.525
I'm an android.

28:20.626 --> 28:22.260
How is that possible?

28:22.361 --> 28:24.195
With this.

28:24.296 --> 28:27.866
It's an upgrade that can
make you so much more.

28:27.967 --> 28:29.997
You have something we need.

28:30.121 --> 28:32.756
I'm offering you a trade.

28:33.038 --> 28:34.606
What do you say?

28:41.148 --> 28:42.985
Too slow. Let's go.

28:43.086 --> 28:44.987
You couldn't wait till at
least he made up his mind?

28:45.088 --> 28:47.823
- Just leave the upgrade.
- He can decide when he wakes up.

28:47.924 --> 28:50.259
Meantime, we've got a file to find.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.961
Oh, there's a force...

28:53.917 --> 28:55.817
Field.

29:08.411 --> 29:10.145
Well?

29:10.246 --> 29:12.715
The good news is it looks
like we got the right file

29:12.816 --> 29:15.250
because it has Ferrous
military-grade encryption.

29:15.352 --> 29:16.986
What's the bad news?

29:17.087 --> 29:20.589
It has Ferrous
military-grade encryption.

29:20.901 --> 29:22.368
We can't read it.

29:22.785 --> 29:25.227
Tabor figured it out, and he
can't program an alarm clock.

29:25.328 --> 29:27.062
He probably had a decryption program.

29:27.163 --> 29:29.331
- It wasn't with the file.
- He must've hidden it elsewhere.

29:30.373 --> 29:33.002
- Great.
- We might be able to break the code,

29:33.103 --> 29:34.637
but it'll take time.

29:34.738 --> 29:36.438
We don't have any more time.

29:36.539 --> 29:37.973
We were never gonna
give it to them anyway.

29:38.074 --> 29:39.441
Arrange the meet.

29:39.542 --> 29:41.777
You two keep working. We need that file.

29:46.116 --> 29:50.045
Emperor, may I present
the graduating class

29:50.137 --> 29:52.606
of the Royal Military Academy.

29:53.100 --> 29:56.002
Future officers of the imperial fleet.

30:08.181 --> 30:09.715
Well done.

30:12.653 --> 30:14.487
Congratulations.

30:18.425 --> 30:19.959
Well done.

30:22.663 --> 30:24.563
I have no doubt you'll serve with honor.

30:34.908 --> 30:36.442
Wait!

30:36.543 --> 30:38.444
Ah!

30:58.932 --> 31:01.834
- Well?
- The needle was poisoned

31:01.935 --> 31:04.170
as we suspected.

31:04.261 --> 31:07.096
One scratch, and you
would've died within hours.

31:07.155 --> 31:08.443
Who is this man?

31:08.596 --> 31:10.897
Apparently, he was a classmate

31:10.990 --> 31:12.491
and a friend of your brother's.

31:12.576 --> 31:15.037
This is what you get
when you try to rule

31:15.096 --> 31:16.597
through fear alone.

31:16.698 --> 31:18.835
Discontent is growing.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.661
Teku is overreacting.

31:21.763 --> 31:25.999
You don't see it because you don't
venture beyond these walls.

31:26.100 --> 31:28.001
I do.

31:32.039 --> 31:35.542
The people want to love you,
Emperor.

31:35.643 --> 31:38.345
Just give them a chance.

31:49.223 --> 31:52.559
You managed to follow simple
instructions and come alone.

31:52.660 --> 31:55.162
Congratulations!

31:55.263 --> 31:56.563
You okay?

31:56.664 --> 31:57.898
Do I look okay?

31:57.999 --> 31:59.733
You're upset. I understand,

31:59.758 --> 32:01.425
but this will all be over soon enough.

32:01.450 --> 32:03.852
Are you kidding me?
What took you so long?

32:04.112 --> 32:05.578
I am so, so sorry.

32:05.603 --> 32:08.505
There were just a few issues
that needed to be resolved,

32:08.943 --> 32:10.610
but it's all good now.

32:10.711 --> 32:12.746
I got the file.

32:15.616 --> 32:17.517
Okay. That's done. You
can come over to me now.

32:20.454 --> 32:23.190
It's fine, Amber. You can
just step right over here.

32:25.526 --> 32:27.360
I don't get it.
What's so funny?

32:31.933 --> 32:33.834
What the hell?

32:33.935 --> 32:35.602
You really are an idiot.

32:35.703 --> 32:37.637
You know that?

32:47.534 --> 32:49.143
I don't understand.

32:49.237 --> 32:50.738
It's not that complicated.

32:50.839 --> 32:52.740
She's with me now.

32:53.307 --> 32:54.807
That's not possible.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.582
Oh, come on, Adrian.

32:56.721 --> 32:58.889
Don't be so naive.

32:58.927 --> 33:00.447
A better offer came along.

33:04.286 --> 33:07.356
As much as I'm enjoying
this, we got places to be.

33:07.457 --> 33:09.257
Now, I'm gonna check this.

33:09.359 --> 33:12.027
If it's real, we'll be on our way.

33:12.128 --> 33:14.796
If not, then you're a dead man.

33:17.300 --> 33:18.900
This isn't you, Amber.

33:19.001 --> 33:20.969
- You've been brainwashed.
- Adrian...

33:21.070 --> 33:23.605
- There's a name for it.
- It's, like, Oslo syndrome,

33:23.706 --> 33:25.607
- or something like that.
- Just stop it.

33:28.711 --> 33:31.613
Did you really think you
had a shot with me?

33:34.254 --> 33:36.658
I didn't... I...

33:36.753 --> 33:38.854
Of course you did.

33:38.955 --> 33:40.856
It's kind of sad.

33:40.957 --> 33:42.624
What the hell is this?

33:42.725 --> 33:44.459
- It's encoded!
- It's not a problem.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.795
- I have a decryption program.
- What?

33:46.896 --> 33:49.464
- Where?
- In a safe place.

33:52.435 --> 33:54.736
Whoa, whoa, what the hell?

33:59.081 --> 34:01.616
You were only pretending?
You were playing him.

34:01.811 --> 34:05.280
Of course. Same way I played Tabor.

34:05.381 --> 34:07.349
Wait, what?

34:07.450 --> 34:09.351
Same way I played you.

34:11.454 --> 34:13.789
Don't take this personally.

34:13.889 --> 34:16.190
Amber, wait.

34:16.292 --> 34:20.695
- What are you doing?
- I am going into business for myself.

34:20.797 --> 34:24.565
Now that you and Tabor and
Goren are out of the way,

34:24.667 --> 34:26.568
the field's wide open.

34:26.668 --> 34:28.969
I have clients lined up.

34:29.071 --> 34:31.239
And a buyer for this.

34:31.340 --> 34:32.938
So this time next year,

34:33.034 --> 34:36.337
I will be retired on
my own private moon.

34:36.579 --> 34:38.480
That's what you really want?

34:38.581 --> 34:41.081
I mean, no offense, but
it sounds kind of lonely.

34:42.886 --> 34:44.386
Friends are overrated.

34:44.487 --> 34:46.621
I think you might be wrong about that.

34:51.127 --> 34:53.027
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

35:07.477 --> 35:09.244
Uh, you're gonna wanna stay down.

35:09.346 --> 35:10.579
Wait! Wait!

35:10.680 --> 35:12.581
Don't hurt her, please.

35:12.682 --> 35:13.916
Seriously?

35:14.017 --> 35:15.984
After what she just tried to pull?

35:16.086 --> 35:18.211
Adrian,

35:19.089 --> 35:22.691
I'm sorry.

35:22.792 --> 35:24.336
I didn't mean what I said back there.

35:24.386 --> 35:25.820
I was just...

35:28.465 --> 35:30.366
so confused.

35:30.467 --> 35:36.772
Because I was with that man for so long,

35:36.873 --> 35:38.107
and I didn't think you were coming,

35:38.208 --> 35:40.142
and I was just really scared.

35:41.945 --> 35:45.080
I know that we never spent
a lot of time together,

35:45.181 --> 35:49.418
but I always thought that there
could be something between us.

35:50.193 --> 35:52.054
And if you give me the chance,

35:53.466 --> 35:56.234
I will prove it to you.

36:03.967 --> 36:06.568
By handing over the decryption program?

36:08.371 --> 36:11.106
Huh?

36:11.207 --> 36:13.909
I remember the day Tabor
gave you that locket,

36:14.010 --> 36:17.646
I thought, "Since when did
Tabor get so sentimental?"

36:17.747 --> 36:19.648
This was his Aunt Miriam's.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.384
Tabor didn't have an Aunt Miriam.

36:22.947 --> 36:24.520
So I don't remember her name.

36:24.621 --> 36:26.789
He didn't have an aunt.

36:26.890 --> 36:29.191
Did he have a grandmother?

36:29.292 --> 36:32.161
Just give it up, princess.

36:32.262 --> 36:35.798
Here.

36:49.345 --> 36:51.513
Shit.

36:51.614 --> 36:55.039
The file has been
successfully decrypted.

36:55.157 --> 36:57.325
We have the coordinates.

36:57.426 --> 37:01.195
It's an uninhabited system
in the Torzen Sector.

37:01.296 --> 37:02.630
You guys,

37:02.731 --> 37:04.732
we need to find out if this is
really what we think it is.

37:04.833 --> 37:06.500
Set a course and drop us
out just within range.

37:06.601 --> 37:08.602
And be prepared to get us out
of there fast if we have to.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.333
Understood.

37:17.346 --> 37:20.915
Receiving long-range telemetry.
Visuals on-screen.

37:24.653 --> 37:26.120
Can you magnify?

37:29.440 --> 37:32.843
It is indeed a facility for the
assembly of interstellar ships.

37:32.928 --> 37:36.831
There are berths for between
60 and 80 depending on size.

37:36.932 --> 37:39.500
Except that they're gone.

37:39.601 --> 37:42.570
We're too late. They already left.

37:42.671 --> 37:44.638
According to Mikkei
intelligence, those ships

37:44.740 --> 37:46.874
weren't ready to go online
for another month at least.

37:46.975 --> 37:48.709
Then where did they go?

38:05.460 --> 38:07.483
General, report.

38:08.463 --> 38:10.831
It was a trap.

38:10.932 --> 38:14.568
The reinforcements were attacked the
moment they entered the Temiken system.

38:15.623 --> 38:19.816
A few ships managed to
escape, but nine cruisers

38:20.208 --> 38:23.377
and three troop carriers were destroyed.

38:30.786 --> 38:33.320
And what about my would-be assassin?

38:33.422 --> 38:36.190
Has he named any co-conspirators yet?

38:36.642 --> 38:39.611
He maintains he acted alone.

38:40.462 --> 38:43.030
Round up his family and
his closest friends.

38:43.131 --> 38:46.100
Guilty or not, an example must be made.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.165
And, General...

38:52.271 --> 38:56.107
Send a cruiser to the miners
in the Nakana asteroid field.

38:56.275 --> 38:58.212
Find the ringleaders, choose one,

38:58.313 --> 39:00.114
and have them publicly executed.

39:00.215 --> 39:02.583
Emperor!

39:02.684 --> 39:06.387
You have something to say, Teku?

39:08.056 --> 39:09.590
You have some advice to offer

39:09.691 --> 39:12.059
on how I should run my empire?

39:44.205 --> 39:46.009
<i>Hey. How you doing?</i>

39:46.361 --> 39:48.062
Hey! Pretty good.

39:48.509 --> 39:50.598
So? What have I missed?

39:51.400 --> 39:56.871
Oh, the usual... action,
adventure, thrilling escapes.

39:57.299 --> 40:00.592
- You?
<i>- Meetings, votes.</i>

40:00.983 --> 40:03.985
Thrilling infrastructure renewal plans.

40:04.086 --> 40:07.989
Wow. No wonder you left. It's
hard to compete with that.

40:08.092 --> 40:11.461
Yeah. The important
thing is, we're making progress

40:11.594 --> 40:12.994
towards a united front,

40:13.095 --> 40:15.529
an interplanetary alliance
that could see us gain entry

40:15.630 --> 40:17.732
<i>into the League of Autonomous Worlds.</i>

40:17.833 --> 40:19.467
And then what?

40:19.568 --> 40:21.102
Then the colonies will
be able to operate

40:21.203 --> 40:22.770
under the League's full protection.

40:23.137 --> 40:26.372
No, I mean, with you. What's next?

40:28.110 --> 40:29.810
I don't know.

40:29.911 --> 40:32.113
I'll go where I'm needed, I guess.

40:33.065 --> 40:36.484
Well, you're needed here, on this ship.

40:37.953 --> 40:40.488
As much as I appreciate
it, there's a difference

40:40.589 --> 40:42.823
between being wanted and being needed.

40:47.162 --> 40:48.462
I miss you.

40:51.633 --> 40:53.487
I miss you, too.

40:53.655 --> 40:56.524
Hey, after the next summit,
I'll be free for a while.

40:56.805 --> 40:58.606
Great time to come visit.

40:58.631 --> 40:59.898
I'd like that.

41:03.111 --> 41:05.179
Duty calls.

41:05.282 --> 41:07.329
I've got to go.
See you soon?

41:07.416 --> 41:09.683
Yeah... Soon.

41:33.708 --> 41:36.566
Commander Nieman, voice identify.

41:37.746 --> 41:39.980
Official report, board
of directors' eyes only.

41:40.082 --> 41:41.882
Begin recording.

41:44.034 --> 41:47.270
The war is going according to plan.

41:47.341 --> 41:49.976
Current projections estimate
our corporate enemies

41:50.001 --> 41:52.269
will be defeated in six months.

41:52.422 --> 41:57.769
However, there has been a
new, unforeseen development.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.734
The independent colonies have organized

42:00.836 --> 42:02.937
much faster than we anticipated.

42:03.038 --> 42:05.606
It now appears they're
getting outside help.

42:05.707 --> 42:08.676
As a result, we'll have
to move up our timetable.

42:08.777 --> 42:10.411
We can no longer afford to
wait until the war's over

42:10.512 --> 42:12.847
to deal with it.

42:12.948 --> 42:16.685
We need to take out any colony
not under our umbrella.

42:16.873 --> 42:19.826
And with victory now assured,

42:19.890 --> 42:22.123
we need to do so in a
way that limits damage

42:22.157 --> 42:24.888
to the infrastructures.

42:26.161 --> 42:29.813
Therefore,
I'm afraid we have no choice.

42:31.633 --> 42:34.034
It's time to use Agent Zero.

42:44.869 --> 42:49.869
