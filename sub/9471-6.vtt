- The one and only!

03:57.444 --> 03:58.677
What? No! This is hilar...

03:58.779 --> 04:01.480
When he and Phil were
squabs, he'd come over to our house.

04:01.582 --> 04:03.515
- He'd eat butter as a snack!
- Yeah!

04:03.617 --> 04:04.650

Scout neckerchiefs.

04:06.954 --> 04:07.819
So dumb looking!

04:07.921 --> 04:09.054

04:09.156 --> 04:11.089
He was the youngest bird ever
to have a heart attack

04:11.191 --> 04:12.824

04:12.926 --> 04:13.792

We used to call him Butter Fuck.

hilarious, it would have been tragic.

04:21.869 --> 04:24.536
Well, uh, I don't think it
pertains to who I am or...

04:24.638 --> 04:26.138
Okay, why are you both in my house?

04:26.240 --> 04:29.141
Oh. Dad and I are actually
going in 50/50

04:29.243 --> 04:31.276

04:31.378 --> 04:33.311
It's not 50/50, but
we're trying something out.

04:33.414 --> 04:35.547
- It's an opportunity.
- You know, it's like a business thing.

04:35.616 --> 04:37.049
We're still sort of work-shopping titles.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.451
I was thinking maybe, like,
Father and Son Co.

04:39.553 --> 04:40.553
Or Daddy and Boy Inc.

04:40.554 --> 04:42.754
Maybe, like, Papa and Baby LLC?

04:42.856 --> 04:45.123
Feel like I've heard
it. How about Larry...

04:45.225 --> 04:46.225
Well, why overthink it?

04:46.293 --> 04:48.193
- I mean, why don't we...
- Larry and Phil?

04:48.295 --> 04:49.461
LarriCo.

04:49.563 --> 04:50.563
LarriCo.

04:50.597 --> 04:52.864
LarriCo and Son...

04:52.966 --> 04:54.733
Days we're closed.

04:54.835 --> 04:56.368
- Ouch.
- What do you think of that?

04:56.470 --> 04:57.636
I thought it was going somewhere else,

04:57.738 --> 04:59.271
- but that's fine.
- Well, that way we have the day.

04:59.373 --> 05:00.939
- No.
- Well, you go in on Sunday.

05:01.041 --> 05:02.140
I'm not going in.

05:02.242 --> 05:04.309
Fuck it. I'm not gonna kill
myself for this thing.

05:04.411 --> 05:06.651
That's all we do at
LarriCo. That's not why I started it.

05:06.714 --> 05:08.847
Anyway, Mike, why we're
here is we need a briefcase

05:08.949 --> 05:10.415
'cause I'm gonna empty
out my bank account

05:10.517 --> 05:13.051
and I need somewhere to put all
the money when we start the business.

05:13.153 --> 05:14.986
Phil, can I see you in the
other room for a second?

05:15.089 --> 05:16.455
Sure. Whatever you want, weirdo.

05:16.557 --> 05:17.923
- Hey, Phil?
- Yeah?

05:18.025 --> 05:20.292
Ask him about the briefcase.

05:20.394 --> 05:21.827
Okay, where is it?

05:21.929 --> 05:23.829
Jesus, you have so many pairs of socks.

05:23.931 --> 05:24.931
- Phil!
- What?

05:24.965 --> 05:26.698
Your dad suddenly
appears out of the blue

05:26.800 --> 05:28.720
and convinces you to hand
over your life savings?

05:28.802 --> 05:30.035
Okay?

05:30.137 --> 05:32.037
Have you forgotten this
asshole abandoned you and your mom?

05:32.139 --> 05:33.839
Mike, I was a very needy child.

05:33.941 --> 05:36.541
Water, food, love,
attention. I mean, I get it.

05:36.643 --> 05:38.577
Anyway, he's forgiven
me and I've forgiven him,

05:38.679 --> 05:39.879
and now we're business partners

05:39.880 --> 05:41.640
and also a dad and a
son who love each other.

05:41.648 --> 05:43.749
Okay, what is this business anyway?

05:43.851 --> 05:45.817
Well, it's, uh, pretty complicated,

05:45.919 --> 05:47.352
but try to follow along here.

05:47.454 --> 05:48.887
- Check it out.
- Okay.

05:48.989 --> 05:50.355
So there's a cage
fight coming up, right?

05:50.457 --> 05:52.591
- Where my daddy, Mr. Matarese to you,
- Got it. Yeah.

05:52.693 --> 05:55.927
Knows for a fact that this
dude is taking a dive.

05:56.029 --> 05:58.029
So, we're gonna bet on this guy to win.

05:58.132 --> 05:59.264
(squeals) I'm so excited.

05:59.366 --> 06:00.366
I could just squeal!

06:00.467 --> 06:02.167
It's like the beginning
a Facebook or something.

06:02.269 --> 06:04.569
Phil, do you not see that he's
taking advantage of you?

06:04.671 --> 06:06.905
Don't raise your wings at me, buddy.

06:07.007 --> 06:09.107
You've only been with
him for five minutes, okay?

06:09.209 --> 06:11.309
I've been with him
for, like, 30 minutes.

06:11.411 --> 06:13.812
He's different now and he loves me,

06:13.914 --> 06:15.514
and I'm sorry you can't see that

06:15.616 --> 06:18.416
because this house is
filled with hatred and resentment.

06:18.519 --> 06:20.318
- Okay.
- I'm getting the fuck outta here.

06:20.454 --> 06:21.586

06:21.688 --> 06:24.122

That just doesn't add up
to me! You look too good.

06:26.460 --> 06:28.560
Yes. And he can hear you.

Boy, you're lucky kid, I'll tell ya.

It was amazing.

06:35.969 --> 06:38.329

- What are you talking about?

07:55.215 --> 07:57.015
I didn't even notice I
did anything different.

07:57.084 --> 07:58.333
You just went, "Goodbye."

07:58.418 --> 07:59.584
That's a terrible voice.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.087
It sounded like it came from
deep inside your vagina.

08:02.222 --> 08:03.643
- Nobody wants that.
- I mean, I already

08:03.668 --> 08:04.780

08:04.841 --> 08:06.057
- I understand that.
- Song-a-ress.

- Just maybe next time he swims by
- Tenor.

08:07.678 --> 08:09.978
We could act more like
a female kind of energy?

08:10.097 --> 08:11.596
Well, now you're
putting me in my head. Like...

08:11.682 --> 08:12.931
I don't mean to put you in your head.

08:13.016 --> 08:14.933
I'm just saying, we haven't gotten
a response from him yet

08:15.018 --> 08:16.102
and I think we need to mix it up

08:16.127 --> 08:17.210
- and so maybe...
- Shh! Shut up!

08:17.271 --> 08:19.437
- Be a woman. Be a woman.
- Okay, okay.

08:19.573 --> 08:21.093

08:24.661 --> 08:25.911
- I like-a the way you swim.
- That is not...

08:25.996 --> 08:28.697
- Oh, my God. That is so offensive.
- I just said,

08:28.782 --> 08:30.542
- "I like the way you swim."
- Don't do that.

08:30.617 --> 08:32.136
You said, "I like-a the way you swim."

08:32.202 --> 08:33.635
- That is not right.
- No. I would never

08:33.659 --> 08:34.860
say that in a thousand years.

08:34.955 --> 08:36.788
That's exactly what you said
and look, he's swimming away.

08:36.924 --> 08:39.090
- Bye, Jeremy! Bye, Jeremy!
- Well, that's what he always does.

08:39.176 --> 08:40.708
Ugh! You drive me crazy!

08:40.794 --> 08:43.211
- I just can't do this anymore, okay?
- What?

08:43.297 --> 08:44.948
I just can't live with you in this

08:44.973 --> 08:46.623

- Take it back.

08:46.683 --> 08:48.550
No. You know what? You
go over to your side

08:48.635 --> 08:49.801

- Mike, hey, buddy. How's it going?

- Uh, it's Phil.
- Uh-huh.

14:48.878 --> 14:51.079
Um, remember about the little
business plan I told you about earlier?

14:51.164 --> 14:52.297
- Uh-huh.
- Things ended up going south.

14:52.382 --> 14:53.702
I blew it. I'm a big, dumb idiot,

14:53.800 --> 14:56.417
and me and my dad are
now tied up in a torture room

14:56.503 --> 14:59.253
by this mean bookie,
Julio, and he's gonna, mm,

14:59.339 --> 15:00.922
basically kill both of us.

15:01.007 --> 15:03.049
So, I need you to come
get me out of here, dude.

15:03.074 --> 15:03.865
- Please.
- Ugh, God.

15:03.977 --> 15:04.977
See? I told you.

15:05.011 --> 15:06.928
Your dad is nothing
but a two-bit crook.

15:07.013 --> 15:08.013
Wait.

tied behind your back?

Yes. Why?

15:12.986 --> 15:14.152

15:14.237 --> 15:16.688
Yes, pervert, but that's not really
the issue at hand, Mike.

15:28.835 --> 15:30.034
Oh, look at that.
