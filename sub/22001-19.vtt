She's coming in hot. She'sThe Mick.

00:03.351 --> 00:05.179
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.222 --> 00:06.484
It didn't take.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.617
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.619
And check out our other Fox programs--Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.662 --> 00:12.447
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.666
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.710 --> 00:15.972
Only on Fox.

00:19.323 --> 00:21.673
[school bell rings]

00:25.938 --> 00:27.070
What it do, nephew?

00:27.114 --> 00:29.203
Mickey, I didn't do it!
They think I stole

00:29.246 --> 00:31.640
Miss Crandall's Golden Apple,
but I didn't.

00:31.683 --> 00:34.295
No one believes me;
it's not fair.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.427
Oh, are you kidding me, Gibbons?

00:36.471 --> 00:38.429
This guy better be a stripper
'cause I refuse to believe

00:38.473 --> 00:40.083
you called the cops
on a seven-year-old.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.737
He's not a stripper--

00:41.780 --> 00:43.260
It's a separate matter.

00:43.304 --> 00:44.870
Is that a real gun?

00:44.914 --> 00:46.350
It better be or I'm in trouble.

00:46.394 --> 00:47.656
Cool. Can I play with it?

00:47.699 --> 00:49.875
No, you may not, but if
it's okay with your mom,

00:49.919 --> 00:51.921
I'll let you turn the lights on
in my cruiser.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.531
Can I, Mickey?

00:53.575 --> 00:56.186
Sure, if you don't mind getting
bacon grease on your fingers.

00:56.230 --> 00:58.145
-I don't mind.
-Okay.

00:58.188 --> 01:00.147
Come on. Hurry up.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.498
GIBBONS:
Thank you for coming.

01:03.541 --> 01:06.196
-The reason we called you...
-Oh, yeah.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.719
Ben, Ben brought me up to speed.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.113
You're having a full-blown
meltdown over missing fruit.

01:10.157 --> 01:13.116
-Well, not exactly.
-Let me save you the trouble.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.770
-He didn't do it.
-Unfortunately,

01:14.813 --> 01:17.555
one of Ben's classmates claims
that she saw him take it.

01:17.599 --> 01:20.123
Even if he did take it,
who cares?

01:20.167 --> 01:21.472
Miss Crandall cares.

01:21.516 --> 01:24.345
The Golden Apple
is a teaching award

01:24.388 --> 01:26.347
-given annually to the...
-[snoring]

01:26.390 --> 01:27.696
Very mature.

01:27.739 --> 01:30.916
[laughing]: Look, Gibbons,
I got a Granny Smith

01:30.960 --> 01:33.702
rolling around in the back
of my car; she can have that.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.704
[sighs] Ms. Molng, I...

01:35.747 --> 01:38.924
I have a thousand other students
at this school,

01:38.968 --> 01:41.275
one of whom was just arrested

01:41.318 --> 01:43.538
with a backpack full
of illegal contraband.

01:43.581 --> 01:46.323
And yet, here we sit
discussing inedible apples.

01:46.367 --> 01:49.152
The point being,
ever since you showed up,

01:49.196 --> 01:50.588
far too much of my bandwidth

01:50.632 --> 01:52.503
has been taken up
with your family.

01:52.547 --> 01:53.939
Oh, I see.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.376
This was never about Ben,
was it?

01:55.419 --> 01:56.333
This is about you and me.

01:56.377 --> 01:58.161
-This is about you.
-And me.

01:58.205 --> 02:01.295
Look, either get
your house in order,

02:01.338 --> 02:03.384
or perhaps the Pembertons

02:03.427 --> 02:05.951
should continue
their education elsewhere.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.562
Consider it a warning.

02:07.605 --> 02:10.042
Warning considered.

02:12.784 --> 02:15.613
Oh.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.615
[beeping]

02:21.271 --> 02:23.752
[door opens, closes]

02:23.795 --> 02:25.667
[siren whooping]

02:30.367 --> 02:32.064
[over speakers]:
Hi, Mickey.

02:32.108 --> 02:34.763
Got something for you.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.156
Pop that in your mouth.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.766
We'll be back in a couple hours
to turn you over.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.421
-I'm sorry?
-You should be.

02:43.815 --> 02:46.427
Your principal's a real knob,
you know that?

02:49.038 --> 02:50.866
Hey. Pay attention to me.

02:50.909 --> 02:52.433
His school's crawling
with cops

02:52.476 --> 02:54.348
and he's having a panic attack
over missing produce.

02:54.391 --> 02:55.784
Cops? What cops?

02:55.827 --> 02:58.439
Some kid got caught with a bag
of dope or something.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.005
They nabbed McCormick.
Boo-yah!

03:00.049 --> 03:01.659
Suck on that,
you frickin' pusher.

03:01.703 --> 03:02.573
Why are you so excited?

03:02.617 --> 03:05.315
-'Cause I ratted him out.
-You what?

03:05.359 --> 03:07.491
He was throwing a rager
for the formal after-party.

03:07.535 --> 03:10.320
He had Molly, booze,
fireworks, the whole shebang.

03:10.364 --> 03:11.843
So you ruined the party?

03:11.887 --> 03:13.671
-Uh-huh.
-God, you are such a coward.

03:13.715 --> 03:16.326
Eh, doesn't bother me, but with
McCormick out of the way,

03:16.370 --> 03:17.588
that crown is as good as mine.

03:17.632 --> 03:19.242
-What crown?
-Formal prince, you know.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.809
It's like prom king,
but for junior high.

03:20.852 --> 03:23.507
I've been picking off all the
other nominees one by one.

03:23.551 --> 03:25.248
[laughing]: I put eye drops
in Aaron Sustata's milk,

03:25.292 --> 03:27.119
so he'd crap himself
during assembly.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.383
And then I started a rumor
that Tim Deegan

03:29.426 --> 03:33.038
had his ribs removed
so he could swallow himself.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.518
You know, Madison Prescott,
she's obviously

03:34.562 --> 03:36.912
-a shoo-in for princess.
-Obviously.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.479
And once that crown is mine,

03:38.522 --> 03:40.394
she'll be trapped with me
all night.

03:40.437 --> 03:42.483
-Don't say trapped.
-Call it what you want.

03:42.526 --> 03:45.616
Point is, she won't be able
to escape.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.836
[Mickey groans]

03:47.879 --> 03:51.100
[Sabrina panting, grunting]

03:57.715 --> 03:59.935
Oh, my God.

03:59.978 --> 04:02.154
â™ª

04:07.769 --> 04:09.423
-[Mickey laughing]
-[shrieks]

04:09.466 --> 04:11.903
[laughing]

04:11.947 --> 04:13.557
Do you ever knock?!

04:13.601 --> 04:15.646
[gasping]

04:15.690 --> 04:17.648
Oh, Sabrina.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.650
What are you doing?

04:19.694 --> 04:21.130
Get out of my room.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.523
Is this about that dance?

04:22.566 --> 04:23.872
I thought you were better
than that.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.395
-Get out.
-No.

04:25.439 --> 04:26.875
Look, if you want to learn
how to dance,

04:26.918 --> 04:29.094
I-I think I have someone
who can teach you.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.748
-Really?
-Yeah.

04:30.792 --> 04:33.534
-Jimmy.
-Oh, screw you.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.318
His mom was a choreographer
for the Ice Capades.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.320
-Yeah, right.
I don't believe you.
-All right.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.321
Believe whatever you want.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.932
I'm gonna go.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.934
Just real quick, before I do,

04:42.978 --> 04:44.675
can you please do that again?

04:44.719 --> 04:47.374
-Get out!
-Oh!

NARRATOR [in film]: Many of the
GIs passed the time away

04:49.419 --> 04:52.466
from the battlefield
smoking opium

04:52.509 --> 04:54.163
and visiting local prostitutes.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.121
I hope you put a bag on it,
you dirty old man.

04:56.165 --> 04:57.471
ALBA:
Mickey.

04:57.514 --> 05:00.169
We got a problem.
I was doing Ben's laundry...

05:00.212 --> 05:01.779
Well, hold on a second.
You still do laundry?

05:01.823 --> 05:03.390
Look at this.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.348
[gasps]

05:10.658 --> 05:11.963
-I can't believe Ben lied to me.
-Mm, believe it.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.356
-He's never lied to me before.
-That you know of.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.750
-I mean, why would he do that?
-'Cause he doesn't respect you.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.360
There's got to be
some explanation.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.493
Mm. There is.
He thinks you're an idiot.

05:19.536 --> 05:20.929
Stop that.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.539
He-He probably just got scared.

05:22.583 --> 05:23.932
Right? That's what kids do.

05:23.975 --> 05:25.499
They think all grown-ups
are narcs.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.501
Whoa. I ain't no narc.

05:27.544 --> 05:28.719
We just got to do that

05:28.763 --> 05:30.504
proverbial bump of cocaine
with him.

05:30.547 --> 05:31.983
What, you got coke?

05:32.027 --> 05:34.159
No. Proverbial coke.

05:34.203 --> 05:35.552
Well, what does that mean,
like primo?

05:35.596 --> 05:36.945
Primo? What?

05:36.988 --> 05:38.163
Y-You're confusing me.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.600
I'm getting all crossed up.

05:39.643 --> 05:40.383
Just follow my lead.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.519
Hey.

05:48.435 --> 05:49.610
You busy?

05:49.653 --> 05:53.004
[sighs]
What can I do for you, Sabrina?

05:53.048 --> 05:55.180
Mickey said
that you're some sort

05:55.224 --> 05:57.182
of dance expert or something?

05:57.226 --> 05:58.967
Ah, she did, did she?

05:59.010 --> 06:01.186
[scoffs]
That's nice of her.

06:01.230 --> 06:04.189
Anyway, there's this dumb
school dance and I was just

06:04.233 --> 06:05.800
wondering if maybe you could,

06:05.843 --> 06:08.977
like, teach me or something.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.632
[inhales]
First, tell me why.

06:11.675 --> 06:12.589
I just told you why.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.417
I need to learn how to dance.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.027
Let's talk facts.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.247
Fact: You're Sabrina Pemberton,

06:18.290 --> 06:21.206
-arguably the coolest girl
in Lockwood history.
-[Sabrina sighs]

06:21.250 --> 06:22.817
You going to this dance flies

06:22.860 --> 06:24.993
in the face of everything
you stand for.

06:25.036 --> 06:26.864
So I'll ask you one more time,
Sabrina...

06:26.908 --> 06:30.259
[belches]
...why?

06:30.302 --> 06:32.261
Fine.

06:32.304 --> 06:35.830
Do you have any idea
what it's like to be me?

06:35.873 --> 06:38.615
To be beautiful and smart
and popular?

06:38.659 --> 06:40.487
Well, as a matter of fact...

06:40.530 --> 06:41.531
You do not.

06:41.575 --> 06:42.793
People take one look at me

06:42.837 --> 06:44.578
and they think they know
exactly who I am.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.057
Well, screw that.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.625
I want to do something
that nobody sees coming.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.584
So I am going to that dance.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.847
And I'm taking the power back.

07:06.513 --> 07:07.601
What the hell is this?

07:07.644 --> 07:08.819
10:00 a.m. tomorrow,

07:08.863 --> 07:10.299
and not a minute late.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.609
Patience, my sweet Madison.

07:15.652 --> 07:16.914
-Soon we'll be togeth...
-Heads up!

07:16.958 --> 07:19.656
[shrieks] Ow!
[groans]

07:19.700 --> 07:21.484
Uh, crud, did I get ya?

07:21.528 --> 07:22.703
Yeah, you did, Farble.

07:22.746 --> 07:24.095
Where's your frickin'
spatial awareness?

07:24.139 --> 07:25.836
Dude, I called "heads up."

07:25.880 --> 07:27.708
What were you gawking at,
anyway?

07:27.751 --> 07:30.058
Nothing. I was just...

07:30.101 --> 07:31.712
What the hell is going on
over there?

07:31.755 --> 07:32.713
FARBLE: You didn't hear?
Elliott Saputo

07:32.756 --> 07:34.279
broke his neck wakeboarding.

07:34.323 --> 07:35.890
He may never walk again.

07:35.933 --> 07:36.891
Dang.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.893
That's a frickin' tragedy.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.721
Everyone's rallying to get him
elected formal prince.

07:40.764 --> 07:43.767
You know, give him the sympathy
vote, lift his spirits.

07:43.811 --> 07:44.899
No, no, no, no,
they can't do that.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.553
Nominations closed a week ago.

07:46.596 --> 07:48.729
He can't even frickin' dance.

07:48.772 --> 07:49.904
Actually,
my dad's an Army medic,

07:49.947 --> 07:51.906
so he sees this kind of stuff
all the time...

07:51.949 --> 07:53.908
Yes, I know, Farble.
I was at assembly

07:53.951 --> 07:55.779
when he FaceTimed
the school from Iraq.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.085
Then, as you know,

07:57.128 --> 07:58.913
the mental obstacle
is the toughest one to overcome.

07:58.956 --> 08:01.655
A positive support system
can go a long way.

08:01.698 --> 08:04.527
Yeah? How's this for support?

08:04.571 --> 08:06.007
[exhales]

08:12.361 --> 08:13.710
Oh, my God! Help!

08:13.754 --> 08:15.756
-Somebody help him!
-FARBLE: Chip.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.714
Hello?

08:20.717 --> 08:22.763
Farble, I'm gonna...

08:22.806 --> 08:24.547
I got to...

08:24.591 --> 08:26.593
[groans]

08:26.636 --> 08:28.333
-Hey, Bento Box!
-[Alba chuckles]

08:28.377 --> 08:30.597
We got a surprise for you.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.685
Whoa. Is that for me?

08:31.728 --> 08:32.773
ALBA:
Oh, you bet.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.775
Looks proverbial, doesn't it?

08:34.818 --> 08:35.689
Okay.

08:35.732 --> 08:38.169
Here, go ahead. Dig in.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.345
-Cool.
-MICKEY: Yeah. It is cool.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.782
And speaking of cool,

08:41.825 --> 08:43.131
you know you can trust us,
right?

08:43.174 --> 08:44.741
Yeah. Hey, we got your back,
no matter what.

08:44.785 --> 08:47.744
Yeah. So, are you sure
you don't know what happened

08:47.788 --> 08:49.354
to your teacher's apple?

08:49.398 --> 08:51.226
Haven't seen it.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.793
You don't think
maybe you could've taken it?

08:52.836 --> 08:54.621
Even if it was just by accident?

08:55.665 --> 08:57.624
No. Mm.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.843
Okay. Okay.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.759
You swear to God
you do not know where it is?

09:02.803 --> 09:05.370
I swear to God
I don't know where it is.

09:05.414 --> 09:08.852
Ben, swear on my life
you didn't take that apple.

09:08.896 --> 09:12.073
I swear on your life
I did not take that apple.

09:17.818 --> 09:20.603
[distant siren wailing]

09:20.647 --> 09:22.997
Screw this.

09:28.742 --> 09:29.960
Going somewhere?

09:30.004 --> 09:32.223
You've been in there
this whole time?

09:32.267 --> 09:33.790
I wanted to see
how committed you were.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.749
Jimmy,
you just wasted half the day.

09:35.792 --> 09:38.665
Then I guess we better
stop bitching and start dancing.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.841
[sighs]

09:43.800 --> 09:46.411
What is this place?

09:46.455 --> 09:47.804
Let's set some ground rules.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.763
First, you don't tell anybody
about this place

09:49.806 --> 09:51.634
-or what goes on here.
-I have no idea

09:51.678 --> 09:53.070
-what goes on here.
-[snaps fingers] Good.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.638
-Let's keep it that way.
Rule two...
-Jimmy,

09:55.682 --> 09:56.987
I don't care
about your rules, okay?

09:57.031 --> 09:58.989
I just want you to teach me
a couple of moves

09:59.033 --> 10:00.774
so I don't look
like a total ass.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.776
That's not how it works, okay?

10:02.819 --> 10:05.213
We need to bring your soul
to the surface.

10:05.256 --> 10:07.650
Because somewhere deep
inside you,

10:07.694 --> 10:10.871
there's a glowing ember,
and we...

10:10.914 --> 10:13.003
[blows]
are gonna blow on it

10:13.047 --> 10:17.007
till it explodes
into a brushfire.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.835
This was a waste of time.
I'm out of here.

10:18.879 --> 10:21.925
Oh, there she goes, clomping
away on her two left feet.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.058
What the hell
did you just say to me?

10:24.101 --> 10:26.016
Nothing. Just that your mother
would be proud

10:26.060 --> 10:27.278
that you're carrying on
the tradition

10:27.322 --> 10:30.542
of talentless Pemberton broads
with no rhythm.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.024
[gasps]

10:34.068 --> 10:36.940
Now, what do you say we quit
screwing around and get to work?

10:36.984 --> 10:39.247
-[groans]
-Get your fat ass off the floor

10:39.290 --> 10:40.683
and show me first position.

We gotta move, now!

-What's going on?
-What's going on is

11:56.019 --> 11:57.760
that the cops are
on their way to arrest you

11:57.804 --> 11:59.109
for stealing Crandall's apple.

11:59.153 --> 12:00.154
But I didn't steal it.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.851
I already told you that.
I swear.

12:01.895 --> 12:03.026
Oh, yeah?
Then what's this?

12:03.070 --> 12:05.376
Yeah, the jig is up.
You are going to jail.

oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

Focus! Okay, focus!
Listen to me, right here!

12:09.424 --> 12:12.601
You have exactly ten seconds to
grab everything you care about.

-Eight seconds!

12:15.952 --> 12:17.954

-Mexico. How's your Spanish?

12:17.998 --> 12:19.564
-Not great.
-Well, you'll pick it up.

12:19.608 --> 12:20.565
Right, Alba?

12:20.609 --> 12:21.566
Yeah, no...

[speaking Spanish rapidly]

12:23.873 --> 12:27.137

Please don't make me go.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.879
I don't want to be Mexican.

12:29.923 --> 12:34.579
I'm sorry I took the apple.
I won't lie anymore.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.668
[Ben sobbing]

12:36.712 --> 12:39.454
Okay. Okay, buddy.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.586
Come on.
It's okay.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.806
Hey, we were just
messing with you.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.808
So, what do you think?
Did you learn your lesson?

12:45.852 --> 12:47.636
Yes. I took the apple.
I admit it.

12:47.679 --> 12:50.030
And every night I tell you
I brush my teeth,

12:50.073 --> 12:52.641
but I don't-- I just wet the
toothbrush and stand there.

12:52.684 --> 12:54.382
And last night at dinner,
when it smelled,

12:54.425 --> 12:55.687
and you asked who farted,

12:55.731 --> 12:56.993
it was me-- I made a fart.

12:57.037 --> 13:00.040
I make lots of farts.
I'm so sorry.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.650
Is that it?

13:10.050 --> 13:11.834
What the hell, Ben?

13:11.878 --> 13:12.835
Where'd you get all this stuff?

13:12.879 --> 13:15.403
I took it from
the policeman's car.

I'm sorry.
I'll give it back.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.106
No, no.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.891
If anyone asks you about this,
you lie.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.284
-But you said not...
-I said lie!

13:32.289 --> 13:33.290
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

13:33.334 --> 13:34.291
You know what we're gonna do?

13:34.335 --> 13:35.640
We're just gonna stay calm.

13:35.684 --> 13:38.078
Right? And let's just
hold still.

13:38.121 --> 13:40.080
Okay?
What did I just say?!

13:40.123 --> 13:41.124
Back up! Back up!

13:41.168 --> 13:42.299
Back your asses up!
You, too, Ben.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.692
Give me some space
while I think.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.476
All right?

13:45.520 --> 13:47.043
I-Is this thing loaded?

13:47.087 --> 13:48.740
-Oh! Ooh, ooh.
-ALBA: Ooh...

13:48.784 --> 13:50.438
-Okay, that's fine,
-Oh. [whimpers]

13:50.481 --> 13:53.963
because the bullets
and the gun together,

13:54.007 --> 13:55.138
very dangerous.

13:55.182 --> 13:57.880
But bullets and guns separate,
very safe.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.664
Right? We're safe.
And Alba's going to

13:59.708 --> 14:02.493
-throw 'em in the trash.
-[whimpers]

14:02.537 --> 14:04.147
Guys, I'm proud of us.
We stayed calm.

-we are all safe.
-[gunshot]

14:08.151 --> 14:09.239
-I'm shot.

always one in the chamber.

I'm gonna call 9-1-1.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.292
No, no, no, no, no.
No, put that down.

14:18.335 --> 14:19.902

for a few days

the right vet.

on the bright side,

14:23.340 --> 14:25.038
now we know it's not loaded.

-CHIP: What the frick was that?
-Oh!

14:26.517 --> 14:27.605
Act normal.
Act normal.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.483
-Chip, everybody.
-ALBA: Yeah.

14:35.526 --> 14:36.484
Hey, what was that noise?
Sounded like

14:36.527 --> 14:37.485
a gunshot or something.

14:37.528 --> 14:38.965
ALBA:
No...

14:39.008 --> 14:41.054
Definitely no noise
down here whatsoever. No.

14:41.097 --> 14:43.491
What's, uh...

14:43.534 --> 14:45.188
what's going on with Ben?

14:45.232 --> 14:46.973
You know, I-I bet him five bucks

14:47.016 --> 14:49.149
he couldn't keep his face
like that for an hour.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.281
-Well, good luck with that.
-[Mickey groans]

14:51.325 --> 14:53.283
-Anyways, I'm off to the formal.
-Oh.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.329
Gonna put the final nail
in Saputo's coffin.

with my girl?

-Think again.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.942
What a dumb kid
for thinking that.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.336
Yeah. I'm gonna plant
a bunch of fake ballots on him

15:02.379 --> 15:04.164
so it looks like he tried
to hijack the crown.

15:04.207 --> 15:05.295
Oh, clever. Clever.

15:05.339 --> 15:06.514
Hey, don't wait up.

15:06.557 --> 15:07.819
Probably gonna crash
at Madison's.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.386
Yeah, definitely gonna happen.
Okay.

of the evidence.

What's this?

15:36.457 --> 15:39.373
No, no. No. No, no, no.

15:39.416 --> 15:41.114
That's the wrong bag.
Where's the bag, Ben?

15:41.157 --> 15:43.116
Uh, I think Chip took it.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.117
Why didn't you stop him?!

15:44.160 --> 15:45.161
I don't know.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.250
It all happened so fast.

15:47.294 --> 15:48.425
All right, we got to get
the bag. Come on.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.079

to work the pedals.

all over your...

16:01.308 --> 16:04.006
Well, all right.
I'll just leave...

are you doing here?

about to die.

No way.

Chip, I'm not feeling very well,
all right?

16:35.646 --> 16:37.257
So give me the bag
before I embarrass you

in front of your whole school.

16:38.649 --> 16:41.478
[scoffs] Please,
you embarrass yourself.

16:41.522 --> 16:44.046
Let go.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.178
You let go. No!

No. Ben, no.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.715
Ms. Molng, was I not clear
in our meeting?

17:00.758 --> 17:03.065
[straining]:
No, you were. You were clear.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.632
I just... I... [groans]

17:04.675 --> 17:06.851
I forgot to take Chip's picture.

Why are you on the floor?
Wh-Whose bag is this?

You know, I think
it's Elliot Saputo's.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.291
You should check inside.

17:11.334 --> 17:12.857
No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.642
No, no, don't check inside.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.122
Excuse me?

17:16.165 --> 17:18.080
You don't want to see
what's inside the bag. Trust me.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.647

I don't trust you.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.301
-It's my bag.
-MICKEY: No, it's not.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.911
-Shut up, Ben.
-BEN: Yes, it is.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.913
I took something, Mr. Gibbons.

17:24.956 --> 17:26.219
Something bad.

17:26.262 --> 17:28.264
Something
that didn't belong to me.

17:28.308 --> 17:29.918
What are you talking about, Ben?

17:29.961 --> 17:31.311
-I'll show you.

Ben, don't.

17:36.707 --> 17:39.449
I know I said I didn't take it,
but I fibbed.

17:39.493 --> 17:42.713
I fibbed to you,
and I fibbed to Mickey.

17:44.367 --> 17:47.240
I'm a naughty little bad boy
that deserves to be punished.

17:47.283 --> 17:48.545
GIRL [over speakers]:
All right, everyone.

17:48.589 --> 17:49.720
It's about that time.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.113
In a minute we're gonna announce

17:51.157 --> 17:52.462
this year's
Lockwood royal court.

17:52.506 --> 17:55.465
Obviously,
I'm very disappointed, Ben,

17:55.509 --> 17:58.381
but I give you a lot of credit
for owning up to it.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.166
We'll discuss this more
on Monday.

18:00.209 --> 18:01.776
-Ms. Molng?
-Hmm?

18:01.819 --> 18:03.299
Go home.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.127
Yep.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.347
I don't understand. Where's...

18:07.390 --> 18:08.391
It's still in the bag.

18:08.435 --> 18:11.394
Oh, you are good.

18:11.438 --> 18:12.787
No. No, you're not good.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.485
Do you understand how hard
I worked just to get here

18:15.529 --> 18:17.922
and lose at the buzzer
to a kid with wheels for legs?

18:17.966 --> 18:21.230
...without further adieu,
I'd like to introduce you

18:21.274 --> 18:23.972
to the Prince of Lockwood:

18:24.015 --> 18:25.756
Chip Pemberton!

18:25.800 --> 18:28.542
[applause]

18:28.585 --> 18:30.500
What?

18:30.544 --> 18:31.762
I won.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.938
Oh, my God, I won.

18:33.982 --> 18:36.202
I am the prince.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.775
Son of a bitch pulled it off.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.386
Let's go home, buddy.

18:46.429 --> 18:48.388
[grunting]

18:48.431 --> 18:50.303
GIRL:
And now, your princess.

18:50.346 --> 18:53.828
We're so proud of the sacrifice
her father makes

18:53.871 --> 18:54.959
for our country.

18:55.003 --> 18:57.571
Give it up for Emily Farble!

18:57.614 --> 19:00.400
[applause]

19:02.315 --> 19:04.360
[quietly]:
Yeah.

19:04.404 --> 19:08.147
I snagged the sympathy vote,
right on.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.330
I just want you to know
that I really admire

19:17.373 --> 19:18.766
-what you're doing.
-Thanks, Bert.

19:18.809 --> 19:19.767
Don't mention it.

19:19.810 --> 19:22.422
And, as a feminist myself,

19:22.465 --> 19:24.206
I think it's great.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.425
Especially in these times.

19:25.468 --> 19:26.774
Me Too, baby.

19:26.817 --> 19:27.992
Me Too. Time's up.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.211
Totally.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.560
No, I'm serious. Time's up.

19:30.604 --> 19:32.214
This girl can't dance
to two songs in a row.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.476
What, is she out of her mind?

19:33.520 --> 19:35.217
Hey, that's enough now!
What are we doing?!

19:35.261 --> 19:37.350
-[record scratches, song ends]
-EMCEE: Show your
appreciation by...

19:37.393 --> 19:39.439
These new girls don't listen.
That was terrible.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.005
I'm embarrassed for you.
I'll see you at home.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.398
-Sabrina!
-Oh.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.226
-What the hell are you
doing here?
-Don't do this.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.228
Excuse me, you're not
the boss of her. Okay?

19:46.272 --> 19:47.795
I'm her brother's father,

19:47.838 --> 19:49.013
and you, my friend...

19:49.057 --> 19:51.102
[Bert grunts]

19:51.146 --> 19:53.279
-[panting]
-[sighs]

19:53.322 --> 19:54.889
How could you lie
to me like that?

19:54.932 --> 19:56.630
Beat it, Jimmy.
This has nothing to do with you.

19:56.673 --> 19:59.459
And what was all the crap
about defying expectation?

19:59.502 --> 20:01.504
I'm still doing that,
I'm just doing it here.

20:01.548 --> 20:02.853
Sabrina, I'm not gonna
pretend to know

20:02.897 --> 20:04.507
what's going on
in your head, okay?

20:04.551 --> 20:06.074
Maybe you're scared,
or maybe you're angry,

20:06.117 --> 20:07.380
maybe you hate your mom

20:07.423 --> 20:09.295
and you're doing this
because she never could.

20:09.338 --> 20:11.427
I don't know, all right?
But what I do know

20:11.471 --> 20:12.602
is that if hit that stage,

20:12.646 --> 20:14.648
you will regret it
for the rest of your life.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.606
I am begging you,

20:16.650 --> 20:19.435
as your friend, don't do this.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.698
EMCEE: All right, folks,
let's keep the party going.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.309
First prize tonight

20:23.352 --> 20:27.400
is walking out of here
with $2,500.

20:27.443 --> 20:30.098
-Amazing! Incredible!
-[laughs]

20:30.141 --> 20:31.447
â™ª Sensational!

20:31.491 --> 20:34.145
What can I say?
I had a great teacher.

20:34.189 --> 20:37.497
-Your cut.
-Why, thank you.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.455
God, I am so proud of you.
I mean, I didn't watch,

20:39.499 --> 20:42.284
-but the crowd was going nuts.
-Yeah.

20:42.328 --> 20:45.069
And you know, obviously, we
cannot tell Mickey any of this.

20:45.113 --> 20:46.680
Oh, I would never
tell Mickey anything.

20:46.723 --> 20:49.073
-Should we get some ice cream?
-Yeah, I would love to.

20:49.117 --> 20:51.337
[engine starter whirring,
sputtering]

20:53.469 --> 20:56.080
[grunts]

20:56.124 --> 20:58.300
Well, no ice cream.

20:58.344 --> 21:01.085
-Breakfast!
-Thanks, Alba.

21:01.129 --> 21:02.391
How are youfeeling?

21:02.435 --> 21:03.653
Pretty good.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.699
The vet said if I was a dog,
I probably would've died,

21:05.742 --> 21:07.527
but I'm not, so I didn't.

21:07.570 --> 21:08.658
I'm confused.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.530
Is lying good or bad?

21:10.573 --> 21:11.922
It's complicated.
You know, the truth is,

21:11.966 --> 21:13.533
lying is just sort of
a part of life,

21:13.576 --> 21:15.143
but important thing
for us to remember

21:15.186 --> 21:16.536
is that we don't lie
to each other.

21:16.579 --> 21:18.886
-Okay.
-Well, well, well.

21:18.929 --> 21:19.930
Good morning, your highness.

21:19.974 --> 21:20.975
How was the rest of your night?

21:21.018 --> 21:22.716
Frickin' amazing.

21:22.759 --> 21:25.501
Madison and I just
hooked up all night,

21:25.545 --> 21:26.720
like I predicted.

21:26.763 --> 21:29.331
-Right.
-Uh-huh.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.551
MICKEY: Hey. Speaking
of last night, where were you?

21:31.594 --> 21:33.509
-I didn't see you at the dance.
-[laughs] You know, it's like...

21:33.553 --> 21:35.772
it's like you said.
The dance was beneath me.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.208
Why were youat the dance?

21:37.252 --> 21:39.907
Uh, I forgot
to take Chip-- Hey.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.387
Good morning, Jimmy.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.562
How you doing?

21:42.605 --> 21:44.999
-What?
-You got in
pretty late last night.

21:45.042 --> 21:48.742
Yeah. You know, I went to the...

21:48.785 --> 21:50.570
you know, like, all the...

21:50.613 --> 21:52.354
What'd you do?

21:52.398 --> 21:54.356
I-I...

21:54.400 --> 21:56.402
[metallic thudding,
item rolling]

21:57.751 --> 21:59.230
Golden Apple?

21:59.274 --> 22:01.711
I'm sorry, I stole it back.

22:01.755 --> 22:04.148
Listen, I'll tell you what.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.498
Next time you want
to steal something,

22:05.541 --> 22:08.544
you come to me,
and I'll steal it for you, okay?

22:08.588 --> 22:10.503
Deal.

22:13.984 --> 22:15.595

Media Access Group at WGBH

MICKEY:
I said lie!

22:21.557 --> 22:23.516
Hope you
enjoyed
kickin' it
withThe Mick.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.605
Now here are a few more shows to check out from Fox.

22:27.650 --> 22:29.609
[beeps]911. What's your emergency?

22:29.652 --> 22:32.438
MAN [on phone]: I'm on Flight 46, and we're going down.

22:32.481 --> 22:35.179
Just tell my wife I'm so sorry that I cannot come home to you.

22:35.223 --> 22:36.267
Hello?

22:38.444 --> 22:41.360
This is your family.
We got you, okay?

22:42.926 --> 22:44.101
Rapid response now!

22:44.145 --> 22:47.061
-We can't save everyone.
-Says who?

22:47.104 --> 22:49.368
It's time we showed Gotham
who we are.
