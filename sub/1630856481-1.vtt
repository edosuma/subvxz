WEBVTT

00:04.754 --> 00:05.130
.

00:05.171 --> 00:05.588
- Hey, Julia.

00:06.548 --> 00:07.841
I just got a text
from the camp.

00:07.882 --> 00:10.343
The bus is gonna drop
Grace off at 5:00.

00:10.385 --> 00:13.346
I am at The Nest recording
one last goldfish video.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.556
I'm going to screen them
for her tonight.

00:14.597 --> 00:17.267
They are hilarious, by the way.

00:17.308 --> 00:19.310
So I will see you at 5:00.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.146
Hey, Jimmy, I'm back.
Still alive?

00:21.187 --> 00:22.147
- Still alive, Dad!

00:22.188 --> 00:24.441
- Good job.

00:24.482 --> 00:27.318
OK.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.446
All right, Gracie,
it's your dear old dad,

00:29.487 --> 00:32.866
recording the final installment
of Diary of a Teenage Goldfish,

00:32.907 --> 00:35.201
or What Googles
the Goldfish Did

00:35.243 --> 00:37.203
While Grace Kearney
Was at Sleepaway Camp.

00:37.245 --> 00:40.165
Now, as you've seen in my
prior compelling installments,

00:40.206 --> 00:41.708
Googles misses you terribly.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.836
But he has also taken
advantage of your absence

00:44.878 --> 00:47.756
by staying up
way past his bedtime,

00:47.797 --> 00:52.510
gorging himself on junk food,
and refusing to do his chores.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.471
Hey, Googles,
better clean up that bowl

00:54.512 --> 00:57.390
are you gonna be in big trouble
when Gracie gets home.

00:57.432 --> 01:01.186
You and your pal, Mr. Old Timey
Diver Guy better snap to it.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.563
Make that bed.
Do the dishes.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.316
Fire up that vacuum cleaner.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.238
No, no, no.
Googles.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.240
Googles.
Oh.

01:14.282 --> 01:16.451
Ow.
Ooh.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.745
Googles, don't you dare
die on me.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.372
Oh.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.915
Oh!

01:21.956 --> 01:24.584
Breathe. Breathe.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.754
Grace is so excited
about seeing you.

01:29.381 --> 01:30.423
[inhales]

01:34.511 --> 01:37.222
Ooh.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.474
- * It's genius *

01:39.516 --> 01:42.894
* The marriage that we once
had now is through *

01:42.936 --> 01:47.607
* And now we're doing
all that we can do *

01:47.649 --> 01:51.736
* To keep us all together
as a crew *

01:51.778 --> 01:55.740
* Trust, do as we say,
not as we do *

01:55.782 --> 01:59.327
* We really thought
that we were done *

01:59.369 --> 02:02.247
* But we've just begun *

02:04.332 --> 02:06.209
- Hi.
My name is Jim.

02:06.251 --> 02:09.254
I'm a dad who recently killed
my daughter's pet goldfish.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.672
- Hi.
I'm Julia.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.549
I'm a mom who's sitting
next to this dear man

02:12.590 --> 02:14.884
who recently killed our
daughter's pet goldfish.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.469
- Not deliberately.
- Yet decisively.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.762
- Indisputably conclusively.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.848
- [chuckles]
Jim and I were married

02:19.889 --> 02:21.641
17 years ago last June.

02:21.683 --> 02:22.934
- Yet, the happiest day
of our lives

02:22.976 --> 02:24.519
was when we got divorced
last July.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.438
- [laughs]

02:26.479 --> 02:28.314
When I asked Jim
for a divorce, he said--

02:28.356 --> 02:29.983
- Please, pretty please,
with sugar on top.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.943
- We had a good run,
but it was time to--

02:31.985 --> 02:33.611
- Run away.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.488
- Some people wonder why.
- We don't.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.490
- Let's just say that the
physical-intimacy component

02:37.532 --> 02:39.242
of the marriage had--

02:39.284 --> 02:40.827
- Ground to a halt,
which can be an indication

02:40.869 --> 02:42.495
that a relationship is--
- Over.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.247
- But just because
that part's over

02:44.289 --> 02:46.666
doesn't mean the affection and
appreciation for one another

02:46.708 --> 02:48.710
had totally vanished.
- Far from it.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.670
- We just began to realize
that our marriage was

02:50.712 --> 02:52.505
in the way of us getting along.

02:52.547 --> 02:55.592
- Divorce can be a good thing.
- A source of ceaseless joy.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.344
- As long as you stay
on the same page.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.636
- Which is easy on paper.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.764
- Less easy in real life.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.433
- Jim, what's wrong?

03:03.475 --> 03:05.727
- Dad, Gracie's goldfish
just died on my watch.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.855
- Which watch?
Don't say the Rolex.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.648
Sorry.
You teed that one up.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.525
To carry on without a retort

03:12.567 --> 03:15.320
would have weakened
my wisecracking muscles.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.322
- Yeah. I just got to figure
out how to tell Gracie.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.698
- It's easy.
Lie to her.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.950
- Yes, that was
my first thought.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.744
- Let it be your last.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.662
Lying's the proper thing
here, Jim.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.289
- Hey, I'm not arguing.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.415
I'm just afraid Grace is
going to see right through it.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.625
- No chance.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.335
- Kids are smart.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.045
- Everyone says that,
but it's not true.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.588
Kids are stupid.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.674
- Not in my experience.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.677
- I lied to you when
Rusty the cat died.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.012
- Rusty the cat died saving
a family from a house fire.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.432
- In my lie, yes.
In truth, nah.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.268
- Wait. You told me that Rusty
the cat meowed really loudly

03:47.310 --> 03:49.062
to rouse the family awake.

03:49.104 --> 03:52.399
- Jim, 40 years later,
I'm coming clean.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.527
Rusty the cat was run over
by a street sweeper.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.445
- Dad, please tell me
it was sudden.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.905
- I can't.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.449
Street sweepers aren't known
for their horsepower.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.953
- But once he was hit,
did Rusty die quickly?

04:04.994 --> 04:06.996
- Sure.

04:07.038 --> 04:10.000
- How did I not notice how bad
a liar you were back then?

04:10.041 --> 04:11.710
- You were a stupid kid.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.378
- Ah, poor Rusty.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.796
- See how hurt
you are right now?

04:14.838 --> 04:16.423
- Yeah.
- We need to protect Grace

04:16.464 --> 04:17.799
from the pain you're feeling.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.468
And, yes, it took
a moment or two

04:20.510 --> 04:23.304
to extract Rusty from
the rolling bristle things.

04:23.346 --> 04:24.848
- You're a monster.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.350
- Sometimes being a monster
is what fatherhood requires.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.686
Now it's your turn,
Frankenstein.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.479
- Yeah, I see that.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.856
All right.
Thanks, Dad.

04:32.897 --> 04:33.773
I got to find Julia.

04:33.815 --> 04:34.858
- Smart.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.443
Julia's a great liar.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.737
She spent 17 years
pretending she liked me.

04:38.778 --> 04:39.946
Where's Jimmy?

04:39.988 --> 04:41.531
- He's in his room
playing video games.

04:41.573 --> 04:42.866
- Nice.

04:42.907 --> 04:46.077
I do my best grandparenting
when I'm ignored.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.747
Text me on the way back,
so I can split

04:48.788 --> 04:52.000
before Julia has to struggle
through her obligatory,

04:52.042 --> 04:54.085
"Good to see you, Bobby."

04:54.127 --> 04:55.795
- Before we go further,

04:55.837 --> 04:57.964
we want to make sure
you get how happy we are.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.884
For most people, divorce
has a negative connotation.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.470
- We wanted to reframe
divorce as an opportunity

05:03.511 --> 05:04.721
for growth, not despair.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.097
- Jubilation, not devastation.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.974
- We considered
ourselves trailblazers

05:08.016 --> 05:10.685
for transforming a negative
thing into a positive thing.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.145
- So, for our divorce,
we decided

05:12.187 --> 05:13.855
to go back to the church
where we were married.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.066
- To host what we called
the very first

05:16.107 --> 05:18.360
reverse wedding ceremony.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.988
- So we gathered
friends and family.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.032
- I slipped into my
old wedding dress.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.743
- I stepped into a cheap suit
and an even cheaper wig,

05:26.785 --> 05:28.828
to resemble how
I looked that day.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.663
- We stood at the altar.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.165
- Took rings off of fingers.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.834
[organ music playing]

05:34.876 --> 05:36.753
- I'm gonna pawn these.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.922
[laughter]

05:38.963 --> 05:40.382
- Pawn this, too.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.136
- We lowered veils.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.681
- And ripped up our vows.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.768
If we were Jewish,

05:51.810 --> 05:53.895
we would have
glued a glass back together.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.066
- And then I backed out
of that marriage

05:58.108 --> 05:59.401
like it never happened.

05:59.442 --> 06:06.408
* *

06:15.750 --> 06:18.128
[Donna Summer's
"Last Dance" playing]

06:18.169 --> 06:22.590
- * Last dance, last dance,
last dance *

06:22.632 --> 06:24.968
- We showed everyone how
to end things on a high note.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.554
- Everyone, that is,
but our daughter, Grace.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.723
- * Last dance *

06:29.764 --> 06:33.184
- So we bought her
a goldfish to cheer her up.

06:39.733 --> 06:39.899
.

06:39.941 --> 06:40.400
[upbeat music]

06:41.192 --> 06:43.028
- Julia, hey.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.696
- Jim.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.989
Are you here for Sunday brunch?

06:46.031 --> 06:47.741
- No, I'm here to see you.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.242
- What?
How did you know I was here?

06:49.284 --> 06:51.244
- What do you mean, how?
Duh.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.704
- Duh, what?
What am I looking at?

06:52.746 --> 06:53.997
- Oh, family sharing.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.916
That blinking green dot,
that's you.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.293
- You're tracking me?

06:58.335 --> 07:00.003
- No.
No, I don't have to track you.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.671
You're sharing
your location with me.

07:01.713 --> 07:02.672
I just have to look
at my phone.

07:02.714 --> 07:03.923
Again, the blinking green dot--

07:03.965 --> 07:05.633
- I know what the
blinking dot is, Jim.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.926
- OK.
- But tracking me

07:06.968 --> 07:08.970
is not the intended use
of that application.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.222
- It's entirely the intended
use of that application.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.974
You share your location
with your family

07:13.016 --> 07:14.642
so your family knows
your location.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.102
- You and I are now ex-family.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.063
- Tell that to your phone.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.856
You're the one who opted
into the sharing.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.816
- When we were married.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.234
- And just like
we opted out of that,

07:23.276 --> 07:24.611
you got to opt out of this,
but that's not important.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.196
- Yes, it is.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.656
As of this moment, I am opting
out of the family tracking.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.700
I am opting.
I am scrolling.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.870
I am searching. I am--

07:33.912 --> 07:35.622
God, where the hell is it?
- Go to Settings.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.123
- I'm under Settings.
- OK.

07:37.165 --> 07:40.126
Take a deep breath.
- Don't tell me how to breathe.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.128
There.
[chuckles]

07:42.170 --> 07:43.713
I am no longer sharing
my location.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.256
I am no longer a blinking dot.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.301
I am a no dot.
I have disappeared.

07:48.343 --> 07:51.346
- I can still see you.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.348
- You can't just track me down
in person anymore, Jim.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.684
We got to reboot
our boundaries conversation.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.812
- OK. I am sorry that I used
the quite common, quite useful

07:58.853 --> 08:00.730
family-sharing feature
that was invented

08:00.772 --> 08:01.731
so that when people
are kidnapped,

08:01.773 --> 08:03.108
they can be rescued.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.651
But I guess
you would rather don

08:04.693 --> 08:06.111
some magical cloak
of invisibility

08:06.152 --> 08:07.987
so that you
can vanish without a trace

08:08.029 --> 08:09.698
whenever somebody
close to you needs you.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.741
Noted.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.410
- Has someone I know
been kidnapped?

08:13.451 --> 08:14.911
- No.
- Does someone I know

08:14.953 --> 08:16.121
need rescuing?
- No.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.289
- Is someone I know
unexpectedly dead?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.958
- Go to your meeting.
- Oh, my God, Jim.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.793
Is someone dead?
- Someone, no.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.212
Something, yes.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.089
- You mother effer.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.674
You killed my orchid!

08:27.716 --> 08:29.676
I told you--I asked you,

08:29.718 --> 08:31.261
please don't kill
any more of my plants, Jim.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.054
- Your orchid is
very much alive.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.431
- Hey, hon.
- Oh.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.766
Hey, baby.
- How's it going?

08:36.808 --> 08:39.644
Hey, Jim.
- Trey.

08:39.686 --> 08:43.314
Here for
the "Miami Vice" convention?

08:43.356 --> 08:46.276
- So, plot twist--
I fell in love with someone

08:46.317 --> 08:47.944
after the divorce.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.904
- Why don't you just say met?
You had to meet first.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.823
- And, oh,
what a meeting it was.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.658
[both chuckle]

08:53.700 --> 08:54.951
How you doing?

08:54.993 --> 08:56.745
I'm Trey Taylor,
owner of the Boston Celtics.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.079
- Mm, you don't need
to say that.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.789
- What, my name?

08:59.831 --> 09:01.833
- Is your name
"Owner of the Boston Celtics"?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.960
- Julia asked me
to introduce myself.

09:04.002 --> 09:07.964
- I didn't say Jim Kearney,
owner of a 2004 Honda Accord.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.717
Oh, hey, Trey, why don't you
say why you met Julia?

09:10.759 --> 09:12.135
- I don't think
that's relevant.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.345
- It's all relevant.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.263
Say how you insulted
half your fan base,

09:15.305 --> 09:17.307
so you needed Julia,
a professional crisis manager,

09:17.349 --> 09:19.684
to swoop down
and save your butt.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.311
- You swooped down, all right.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.730
[laughter]
Boy, did you swoop down.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.315
[laughter]
- Ew. Ew.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.484
Ew. Ew.
- OK.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.278
- OK. All right. Fine.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.698
After a night out in Boston,
I was ambushed by paparazzi.

09:33.740 --> 09:37.786
And I made a comment
that some people took--

09:37.827 --> 09:40.330
- Exactly how you intended.

09:40.372 --> 09:42.248
- The Celtics are playing
like crap.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.833
And if we don't fix it,
we're gonna be

09:43.875 --> 09:46.002
the redheaded stepchild
of the NBA,

09:46.044 --> 09:48.338
but redder and steppier
than the reddest,

09:48.380 --> 09:50.382
headiest, steppiest child ever.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.425
You know what I'm saying?

09:54.386 --> 09:56.179
- It was an innocuous comment.

09:56.221 --> 09:59.057
- Oh, no, it wasn't.
It was very offensive.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.810
Very, very offensive.
Peak offensive.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.354
Trey, uh, tell everyone
how you got schooled on exactly

10:04.396 --> 10:08.400
how offensive the term
"redheaded stepchild" is.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.986
- Celtic means Celt,
which means Irish, Ireland,

10:12.028 --> 10:14.447
lot of redheads,
lot of Catholics,

10:14.489 --> 10:16.866
not a lot of birth control,

10:16.908 --> 10:20.495
therefore,
a fair amount of stepchildren.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.081
I not only offended half
of the Celtic fan base,

10:23.123 --> 10:25.542
but I offended
an entire country.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.127
- It blew up.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.545
There were threats
of protests, boycotts.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.046
People were pissed.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.340
- What does this have to do
with the fish?

10:32.382 --> 10:34.300
- Anyway, Kevin Kelly,
the GM of the Celtics,

10:34.342 --> 10:36.177
got in touch with me
and introduced me to Trey

10:36.219 --> 10:38.763
to help him manage the--
- Public-relations disaster

10:38.805 --> 10:40.390
that Trey's ignorance
had ignited.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.227
- Look, Trey,
this is all gonna be fine.

10:44.269 --> 10:45.228
We just have to
fix the perception

10:45.270 --> 10:46.521
before we fix the problem.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.064
So your first task
is to walk out there,

10:48.106 --> 10:49.232
look 'em in the eye,

10:49.274 --> 10:50.984
and read the statement
I wrote for you.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.028
- All right, cool. Cool.
What's the goal?

10:53.069 --> 10:55.113
- To say something
that means nothing but still

10:55.155 --> 10:56.823
makes this all go away.
- Love that.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.908
- Read this, please.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.286
- "I am committed to
a new path of understanding.

11:01.327 --> 11:04.164
"And I ask you to help me
usher in a new era of shared

11:04.205 --> 11:07.042
"creative pragmatism that
warrants deep introspection

11:07.083 --> 11:09.085
from us all."

11:09.127 --> 11:11.254
What does that mean exactly?

11:11.296 --> 11:14.132
- It's subtly reminding people
that forgiveness is a virtue.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.301
And shame on them if they
haven't cultivated that virtue

11:16.343 --> 11:18.345
in their own lives
and find themselves unable

11:18.386 --> 11:20.597
to furnish mercy and compassion
for those of us

11:20.638 --> 11:22.807
who are courageous enough
to admit our faults.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.310
Shame on them. Shame.
It's unforgivable.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.145
- You're good.
She's good.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.563
- Perfect.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.565
Bunch of words
adding up to nothing,

11:30.607 --> 11:33.443
but sure as hell sounding like
they add up to something.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.945
- And despite all
of that great advice,

11:35.987 --> 11:37.489
I still had to take
responsibility

11:37.530 --> 11:39.240
for my ignorance.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.242
So I apologized sincerely.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.453
- And it worked.
- And I fell in love with her.

11:43.495 --> 11:47.040
- And I fell in love with him--
his values, his mind, quickly.

11:47.082 --> 11:48.958
- Quickly.
- Quickly.

11:49.000 --> 11:49.959
- Very quickly.
- Yes.

11:50.001 --> 11:52.295
- [laughs]
- Very quickly.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.214
[laughs]

11:54.255 --> 11:56.091
Who would have thought
that putting my foot

11:56.132 --> 11:58.009
in my mouth would lead
to the hottest woman I know

11:58.051 --> 12:00.303
putting her foot in my mouth?

12:00.345 --> 12:02.013
- OK.
Yabba-dabba-doo.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.307
Nobody cares about this,
especially me.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.309
- You killed Googles?
- No.

12:06.351 --> 12:09.854
But having not killed him
doesn't mean he's not dead.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.606
- How the hell does
a fish just die?

12:11.648 --> 12:13.400
- Well, the toxicology
report comes back--

12:13.441 --> 12:16.027
How the hell should I know?

12:16.069 --> 12:18.154
These things only live,
like, six months, anyway.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.573
- Actually, the life expectancy
could be up to 15 years

12:20.615 --> 12:22.867
if properly cared for.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.911
- How do you know that?
- Class I took at MIT.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.205
- College is such a racket.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.165
- Go buy a lookalike fish, now.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.500
- And do what with it?

12:30.542 --> 12:32.252
- Try to keep it alive
till I get there.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.963
[upbeat music]

12:35.005 --> 12:37.007
- [whistling]
- Hey, Grandpa.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.384
Can I have a Popsicle?
- Sure.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.180
- Is this Grace's goldfish?

12:44.222 --> 12:45.598
- That is he, Jimmy.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.267
- Why is he in the freezer?

12:47.308 --> 12:48.560
- I don't know.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.353
Your father thought
it was more dignified

12:50.395 --> 12:52.188
than flushing him
down the toilet.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.606
- Does Grace know he's dead?

12:53.648 --> 12:55.025
- She does not.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.192
Can I make you a fluffernutter?

12:56.234 --> 12:57.444
- Can I still
have the Popsicle?

12:57.485 --> 12:59.195
- You can have both.
I'm in charge.

12:59.237 --> 13:02.157
I say they go great together.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.034
- So we focused
on the crisis at hand

13:04.075 --> 13:06.619
and got a lookalike goldfish.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.955
What?
Just say it.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.915
- Babe, I didn't say anything.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.542
- You dipped your head.

13:12.584 --> 13:16.296
I mean, your head dip
said quite a bit.

13:16.338 --> 13:19.299
- I did not share Jim and
Julia's bulletproof confidence

13:19.341 --> 13:21.634
in the lookalike-fish strategy.

13:21.676 --> 13:24.554
* *

13:24.596 --> 13:27.432
- Perfect.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.392
- Welcome to The Nest,
Googles 2.0.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.353
Now, keep
your fish gills glued.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.688
- Boom.
Crisis averted, crisis manager.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.399
- Yeah.
[chuckles]

13:36.441 --> 13:39.110
[clears throat] Uh, Jim.
- Mm-hmm.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.945
- I want you to know
that I was at the hotel

13:40.987 --> 13:42.238
to meet with a wedding planner.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.407
- Oh. Who's getting married?
- We are.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.117
- Oh.
[chuckles]

13:46.159 --> 13:48.536
Fantastic.
Congratulations.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.246
- You're happy for me?

13:50.288 --> 13:53.249
- I'm happy for me.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.168
Finally, some other schmuck
is gonna know

13:55.210 --> 13:57.045
what it's like
to be married to you.

13:57.087 --> 13:58.713
- Who you calling schmuck?

13:58.755 --> 14:00.298
- You.
[chuckles]

14:00.340 --> 14:02.092
Ah, I'm just joking.
I'm joking.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.593
I'm happy for you both.
- Well, thank you, Jim.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.595
That's magnanimous.
- Congrats, Trey.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.472
- Oh, wow.
I really appreciate that, Jim.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.307
- Feel free to show
your appreciation

14:09.349 --> 14:11.601
with floor tickets
to a Celtics game.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.728
- Looks like we both met
the man of our dreams.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.480
- [chuckles]

14:15.522 --> 14:17.107
- And together, we solved
the nightmare of the dead fish.

14:17.148 --> 14:20.235
And when Grace arrives, she'll
never know the difference.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.237
- Eh...

14:22.278 --> 14:23.738
- What?

14:23.780 --> 14:26.116
- Forgive me.
I'm not in favor of lying.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.743
- Why not?
- "Why not"?

14:28.785 --> 14:32.706
- Lying is what parents need
to do sometimes to build trust.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.292
- I think she can
handle the truth.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.460
- Well, she's not your kid.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.004
- I'm about to be
her stepfather.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.547
- Good thing
she's not a redhead.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.509
- I addressed that issue
publicly.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.469
- And Jim is the only one
who still brings it up.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.138
- Funnier every time.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.723
- I respect the way
you raised her.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.057
Clearly, it worked.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.393
But the Grace I know
is really smart,

14:53.435 --> 14:55.395
and she pays attention
to detail.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.731
- Dude, that's why
we're lying to her.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.609
- Look, Trey,
you're sweet, OK?

15:01.651 --> 15:03.528
And I agree with everything
that you said about Grace.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.363
My philosophy is,
you should never lie

15:05.405 --> 15:06.823
unless you can
get away with it.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.616
And I think we can here.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.493
- That is the Julia
I fell in love with--

15:10.535 --> 15:13.204
shifty, flawed, devious.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.373
We must all swear
to bury this secret

15:15.415 --> 15:18.376
along with the original fish.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.544
- I don't think
we can get away with it,

15:19.586 --> 15:21.171
and I don't think
we should try.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.089
- So what's your solution?
- Tell her the truth.

15:23.131 --> 15:26.176
[both laugh]

15:26.217 --> 15:28.345
- Oh, oh, oh, he's serious.
- Oh, OK. Yeah.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.804
- She's 13 years old.

15:29.846 --> 15:32.057
Don't insult her intelligence
by lying to her.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.059
She'll get it.
It's nobody's fault.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.061
- Well, I think we all agree
it's Jim's fault.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.229
- Hey, I fed this fish
five meals a day,

15:38.271 --> 15:40.482
and then ten meals on Friday
to get through the weekend.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.317
- Oh, God, no.
- You are such a jackass!

15:42.359 --> 15:43.860
- You killed that fish.
You killed that fish.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.362
[phone chimes]

15:45.403 --> 15:46.863
- [gasps]
Grace is in the elevator.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.407
- How do you know?
- Duh, I'm tracking her.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.536
- Uh, y'all better
hide that body.

15:53.578 --> 15:54.746
[door closes]
- Hey, everybody.

15:54.788 --> 15:55.830
- Hi, Gracie.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.165
- Mom.
- Welcome home.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.500
- Hi.
- Welcome home.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.584
Oh, sweetie.
- Oh, there's my girl.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.503
Hey.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.880
- Trey, this is a surprise.
What are you doing here?

16:03.922 --> 16:05.840
- I came to welcome you home
from camp.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.759
How was it?
- It was fine.

16:07.801 --> 16:11.846
I missed my family
and my favorite fish, Googles.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.723
How you doing, bud?

16:13.765 --> 16:15.350
- Hey, Grace.
Welcome home.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.726
- Hey, Jimmy.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.812
- Oh, I see you got
a new goldfish.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.440
- What do you mean new?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.484
- Isn't this dead one
the old one?

16:28.446 --> 16:31.783
- Trey killed Googles.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.494
And then he asked us
to lie about it.

16:34.536 --> 16:37.455
- Why would you do that?
- Grace, Trey didn't do--

16:37.497 --> 16:39.124
- Because I was ashamed.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.834
- Trey.
- Let him speak.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.754
- Your mom was stuck
in a meeting,

16:44.796 --> 16:46.715
and your dad and brother
weren't here.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.175
And I was tasked
to watch the goldfish,

16:49.217 --> 16:50.635
and I failed miserably.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.638
I am so sorry.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.474
- Trey, who killed Googles?
Mom or Dad?

17:04.691 --> 17:04.858
.

17:04.899 --> 17:06.359
- I'm sorry, Grace. I know I was
supposed to care of your fish,

17:07.235 --> 17:08.570
and I blew it.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.321
You blew up our family.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.906
- Wait, what?

17:11.948 --> 17:14.492
- Both of you.
I don't care about the fish.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.620
I mean, of course I loved
Googles, but it was a fish.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.831
You thought I couldn't handle
the death of a little fish

17:19.873 --> 17:21.666
when I handled the death
of the only family

17:21.708 --> 17:23.251
that I've ever known?

17:23.293 --> 17:24.836
Don't you realize
how grown I am?

17:24.878 --> 17:27.839
I'm 13 1/2.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.466
- Yes.

17:29.507 --> 17:32.427
Mustn't forget about the half.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.846
- What I loved was
our family intact--

17:34.888 --> 17:36.639
the fabulous foursome.

17:36.681 --> 17:39.851
But now I'm just a lost soul
from a broken family.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.561
- No, you're not.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.938
- I am.
Before you know it,

17:43.980 --> 17:46.358
I'm gonna have a tongue ring,
start vaping.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.485
I'm gonna need to talk
to a counselor.

17:48.526 --> 17:51.321
Unlock the liquor cabinet
and cut up the cocaine.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.034
- Grace, I can see
that you're upset.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.535
- Oh, my God.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.497
Mom, you're using
mirroring language.

18:00.538 --> 18:03.041
I can see
that you're not upset.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.876
Me, I'm jubilant.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.378
Divorce is fun.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.338
I'm a pioneer at reframing

18:08.380 --> 18:10.548
how my parents
have destroyed my family.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.550
Bust out the champagne.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.594
- Come on, Grace,
that's not fair.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.388
- Fair?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.890
You always tell us that family
is the most important thing.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.684
We became a family

18:20.725 --> 18:23.395
because you two
decided to make a family.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.939
And then you unmade it
without asking us.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.649
That's not fair.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.946
- Jimmy, are you doing OK?

18:32.987 --> 18:35.573
- Yeah.
I just scored my high score.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.659
Is Grace addicted to blow?

18:39.411 --> 18:40.412
- Not yet.

18:42.414 --> 18:43.623
- I'm sorry, Grace.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.417
I shouldn't have lied
about Googles.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.585
- I'm sorry, Grace.
I shouldn't have let Trey lie.

18:47.627 --> 18:51.006
- I'm sorry Trey lied
to you, Grace...

18:51.047 --> 18:53.591
and that your mom
didn't stop him.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.301
I'm joking.
I'm joking.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.511
- I'm going to my room.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.430
- Grace.
Grace, you're right.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.306
We've done you
a terrible disservice,

19:00.348 --> 19:02.726
unfairly, as you said,

19:02.767 --> 19:04.936
by being so determined to make
this divorce non-disruptive

19:04.978 --> 19:06.646
that we bypassed your feelings.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.314
- Mom, I'm your daughter,

19:08.356 --> 19:10.567
not a crisis
that you need to manage.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.527
Before I could even be sad
about your divorce,

19:12.569 --> 19:13.987
you were so caught up
in telling me

19:14.029 --> 19:15.989
and the rest of the world
how great it was.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.577
- We didn't mean
to rush you through this.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.871
- Or skip past it.
But we did.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.789
- And we're ready to talk
about it in depth

19:24.831 --> 19:27.042
as much as you want.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.962
- Or if this little chat
was sufficient...

19:31.004 --> 19:33.548
uh, we can move on
with our lives

19:33.590 --> 19:35.842
and celebrate
that your mother and Trey

19:35.884 --> 19:37.719
are engaged to be married.
- What?

19:37.761 --> 19:38.887
- [yelps]

19:40.555 --> 19:43.058
- And that's how
we got Googles 3.0.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.893
- So we're here,
warts and all,

19:44.934 --> 19:47.145
making mistakes in our lives
for your benefit.

19:47.187 --> 19:50.065
- So you can see what to do and
maybe not to do in a divorce.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.359
- And in a marriage.
That's where you come in, Trey.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.903
- I have no clue
what I'm getting into.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.489
- A great family, that's what
you're getting into.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.657
Fluffernutters for everybody.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.701
- Good to see you, Bobby.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.621
- Good to see you, Julia.

20:04.662 --> 20:07.040
* *

20:07.082 --> 20:10.627
- * I'm getting swag
in the suite *

20:10.669 --> 20:14.047
* I'm getting swag
in the luxury suite *

20:14.089 --> 20:17.759
* I'm getting swag
in the suite *

20:17.801 --> 20:21.012
* I'm getting swag
in the luxury suite *

20:26.559 --> 20:28.603
- What are you doing
with that lamp?

20:28.645 --> 20:29.896
- I'm taking it
to my apartment.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.564
- Why?

20:31.606 --> 20:34.693
- I need a lamp.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.696
- Did you ask Trey if you could
take a lamp out of his suite?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.948
- He said, help yourself
to anything you want.

20:39.989 --> 20:42.575
So I'm helping myself
to something I want.

20:42.617 --> 20:46.830
- He meant food and drinks,
not appliances and hardware.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.748
- Hoo-hoo!

20:48.790 --> 20:51.209
How about them Boston Celtics?

20:51.251 --> 20:53.128
You guys are good luck.
We're playing well.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.713
Mwah.
- [chuckles]

20:54.754 --> 20:56.548
- Thanks for all
the cotton candy, Trey.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.550
- How many of those
have you had?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.051
- I don't know.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.012
Maybe six.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.097
- Jimmy, quit that.
- Yeah, Jimmy.

21:04.139 --> 21:06.057
Quit it like our parents
quit their marriage.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.767
both: Whoa!

21:07.809 --> 21:10.729
- Grace,
chip off the old block.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.564
- Jim, put the lamp back.

21:12.605 --> 21:16.234
- Trey, did you or did you
not say help yourself?

21:16.276 --> 21:18.153
- Enjoy the lamp, Jim.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.572
- Thank you.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.157
I'm gonna put this in the car.

21:24.284 --> 21:28.621
* *
