00:10.090 --> 00:12.590
[Phonse] Safe to say,
Rose won't be fixing me up

00:12.630 --> 00:14.760
with any of her hot friends.

00:14.800 --> 00:15.850
Speaking of hot.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.010
[Malachy]
Hey. Watch it.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.890
[Phonse]
Oh, she is, though, Mal.

00:18.930 --> 00:22.020
You always were unfairly lucky
when it came to brilliant

00:22.060 --> 00:23.440
beautiful women.

00:24.100 --> 00:24.440
Argh!

00:25.900 --> 00:27.730
I'm glad the two of you think
this is so hilarious.

00:27.770 --> 00:29.280
Were the sacs really necessary?

00:29.320 --> 00:30.820
I've been here
a thousand times.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.740
Well, I was going
for shock value.

00:32.780 --> 00:33.860
Not subterfuge.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.820
Point made.
Point taken.

00:35.860 --> 00:37.990
Phonse is gonna find a way
to pay you back.

00:38.030 --> 00:39.030
So, we'll be on our way.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.160
[Eileen]
You better settle in.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.000
Because we're gonna talk
payment options.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.460
And after you hear option one:

00:43.500 --> 00:44.870
immediate repayment,

00:46.250 --> 00:47.880
you're not gonna like
your choices.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.810
[Jake] So, did your good buddy

01:06.850 --> 01:08.310
happen to mention
where we could find him?

01:08.360 --> 01:09.230
[Malachy] You know what Phonse is like.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.020
Not one for planning.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.440
It's part of his charm.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.740
All I know is, we've been
walking around here forever.

01:13.780 --> 01:15.360
Okay, I still don't understand
why we're not in the car

01:15.400 --> 01:16.610
driving
looking for him.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.530
Burns too much gas,
just driving around.

01:18.570 --> 01:19.910
It's bad for the environment.

01:19.950 --> 01:21.580
Meaning you're too cheap
to pay for the gas,

01:21.620 --> 01:22.790
and you didn't want to pay
the parking fee.

01:22.830 --> 01:23.580
Psst.
Fellas.

01:24.370 --> 01:26.080
Phonse?
There he is!

01:26.120 --> 01:27.880
Malachy Doyle.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.500
It's been too long.

01:29.540 --> 01:31.340
Way too long.
Ten years.

01:31.380 --> 01:32.710
Either way.
It's good to see you.

01:32.750 --> 01:34.720
Jake. The last time we were
in the same room,

01:34.760 --> 01:36.680
you were still in short pants.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.340
I have no idea
what short pants are.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.600
Um. Why are we in
a parking garage?

01:40.640 --> 01:42.010
That's a good question.
Phonse?

01:42.060 --> 01:43.890
To be honest, there's been some
aggressive attempts

01:43.930 --> 01:45.430
on my life.
Someone's trying to kill me.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.270
Is this another
ex-girlfriend or something?

01:47.310 --> 01:48.480
[Phonse]
No, no, no.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.480
It's a little more
complicated, I'm afraid.

01:50.520 --> 01:51.650
I've been cleaning my life up.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.280
Got a new job. Jake.

01:54.320 --> 01:56.110
I'm a courier now.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.740
- Cool. What?
- Yeah.

01:57.780 --> 02:00.320
So, through the jigs
and the reels,

02:00.370 --> 02:01.910
a few bullets
have been sent my way.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.790
- You've been shot at.
- Let's get out of here, now.

02:03.830 --> 02:05.160
Phonse, this is serious.
Come on.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.040
Grab your car.
I'll meet you out front.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.420
B'ys. Try not to attract
any attention.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.130
They could be anywhere.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.500
He's an odd duck, that one.

02:14.550 --> 02:16.260
Yeah. He can be a pain.
But he's a good guy.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.590
Loyal as the day is long.
Always has been.

No. Yes. Yes.
I'm fine.

He's really sensitive about
the whole shed thing.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.670
Got it.
It's a nice cabin.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.330
He used to hide out here,
back in the old days

04:15.380 --> 04:16.960

- A hundred.

Three hundred thousand dollars?

- We should talk.
- Everything okay?

I hear you're visiting
Maurice Becker in the pen.

It's not a great time.
There's a lot on the go here.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.200
If something's going on with
Becker, I need to know, now.

And let's keep this between us.

Phonse back to our house?

on with Jake and Becker.

you take Phonse here.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.460
And I'll deal with Leslie.

[Jake] What have you got on the
pickup truck that ran me over?

05:52.600 --> 05:56.140
[Des] From the plate Mal gave me
It belongs to a Dante Peterson.

05:56.180 --> 05:58.730
So Dante's truck is registered
to Peterson Minerals,

05:58.770 --> 06:00.150
a mining company over there.

06:00.190 --> 06:01.730
Oh, and I checked online.

06:01.770 --> 06:03.230
And my suspicions were correct.

06:03.980 --> 06:04.900
You're hurt.

06:04.940 --> 06:05.570
Bad.

06:05.610 --> 06:05.650
So two things.

06:07.070 --> 06:09.160
You should be lying down.
Or, at least not prone.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.490
And you should call a doctor.

06:10.530 --> 06:11.910
Like your ex-wife.
Nikki.

06:11.950 --> 06:14.240
No waiting.
No line-ups.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.410
And maybe a little...

06:16.500 --> 06:18.500
Des, I'm not calling Nikki.
Okay?

06:18.540 --> 06:19.540
She moved
out of the province anyway.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.750
So that's not going to happen.

06:20.790 --> 06:23.130
Well, then go home,
and have a rest, b'y.

06:23.170 --> 06:24.420
Have some liquids.

06:24.460 --> 06:26.010
And maybe have a nice hot bath.

06:26.050 --> 06:27.590
Oh, you don't have a bath.

06:27.630 --> 06:29.550
Well, have a shower,
or be seated.

That will clear up the jaundice.

in the winter? Or...

06:50.990 --> 06:52.240
Yeah. Well.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.700

an accident there.

just take off? Or what?

Well, at least
I got a photo.

07:18.180 --> 07:20.600

07:28.070 --> 07:29.280

Don't get me wrong, Rose.
It's always nice to see you.

07:35.450 --> 07:37.540
But I asked for Malachy
to be here.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.120
Where is he?

07:39.160 --> 07:40.790
He's swamped.
He's helping a friend.

07:40.830 --> 07:42.580
But I can answer
all your questions.

07:42.620 --> 07:44.210
I've been calling Jake all day.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.670
Is it true he was hit
by a truck?

07:45.710 --> 07:48.260
He was.
He's fine. He's resting.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.720
But how did you know about that?

07:49.760 --> 07:50.920
Des told me.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.340
Not that Jake knows
how to answer a phone.

07:53.220 --> 07:53.850
Are you sure he's all right?

07:55.010 --> 07:57.060
Yeah. He's at the office.
He'll be okay.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.060
It just
did a number on his ribs.

08:00.100 --> 08:00.890
Off the record.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.690

08:02.730 --> 08:04.650

of my undercover contacts

08:04.690 --> 08:05.940
that he's gunnin' for Jake.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.150
Uh, no. It was a case
we're working on.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.780
How did you hear about
Becker and Jake?

08:11.820 --> 08:14.910

not to question me on this.

But I need you and Malachy
to leave Maurice Becker alone.

Just call him.

08:23.710 --> 08:26.040

from Maurice Becker.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.380
Okay.

08:37.510 --> 08:40.350
So, tell me more about
this Eileen.

08:40.390 --> 08:41.230
What are we dealing with?

08:42.310 --> 08:45.230
She's a tough lady.
But so pretty.

08:46.020 --> 08:47.270
She's trying to kill you.

08:47.310 --> 08:49.520
She's done it to others before
who couldn't pay.

08:49.570 --> 08:52.780
Yet you still got yourself three
hundred K in deep with her.

08:52.820 --> 08:54.240
From mahjong.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.620
I was about to get
the Three Lesser Scholars.

08:56.660 --> 08:58.240
It's a hand in mahjong.

08:58.280 --> 09:01.500
But I blew it.
It's a funny game.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.370
But so addictive, man.

09:03.410 --> 09:03.460
No doubt.

09:04.870 --> 09:07.080
I really think it's time you
give me back my gun.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.840
Forget it, Phonse.
No can do.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.800
Guns are a lot more trouble
than they're worth.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.460
I may need it to defend myself.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.090
Not to mention you.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.050
I got your back, buddy.

09:15.090 --> 09:16.800
Ironic. Since you
nearly put a bullet

09:16.840 --> 09:18.260
in mine a little while ago.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.310
No guns, Phonse.
That's how it has to be.

09:20.350 --> 09:21.260
Right.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.930
Then can we go back to my car?

09:22.980 --> 09:24.390
I got some stuff in there

09:24.430 --> 09:27.560
that might be able to get me out
of Eileen's bad books.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.980
Call Des.
Get him to grab it.

09:29.020 --> 09:30.610
No, no, no, no.
I gotta get it.

09:31.360 --> 09:32.900
It's a personal thing.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.440
Better not be skin mags.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.860
Ha, ha, ha. Skin mags.

09:35.910 --> 09:37.660
[ring]

09:39.280 --> 09:41.990
Hey there.
What does Leslie know?

09:42.040 --> 09:44.330
She knows
we're looking into Becker.

09:44.370 --> 09:46.330
- How?
- I don't know.

09:46.370 --> 09:47.920
But I think it's something
we should keep an eye on.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.040
In the meantime, do you mind
running a background check

09:50.090 --> 09:51.460
on this Eileen Jamieson?

09:51.500 --> 09:54.130
- See what you can find?
- Yeah, sure. But Mal, listen.

09:54.170 --> 09:55.880
Leslie's mad
at both you Doyle men.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.930
So you're gonna have to do some
damage control later.

09:57.970 --> 09:59.550
Eh, I'm practically
her father-in-law.

09:59.590 --> 10:01.510
She'll live.
It's good practice.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.600
Yeah. Okay.

10:12.610 --> 10:13.730
[Malachy] We shouldn't be back here.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.240
- Something feels wrong.
- [ring]

10:15.280 --> 10:16.570
It's really important.

10:18.610 --> 10:21.330
Jake. How's your ribs?
Is Des helping you out?

10:21.370 --> 10:22.700
Des!
I'm on the phone!

10:22.740 --> 10:25.160
Oh, can you ask him to pick up
some frozen peas?

10:25.200 --> 10:26.290
I'll pay him back for it.

10:26.330 --> 10:27.910
Oh, and something
that we can microwave.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.040
I want to alternate
between hot and cold.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.340
And some high fiber-

10:31.380 --> 10:32.290
rich foods.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.170
A preventative strike on

10:34.000 --> 10:36.130
constipation side effects.

10:38.510 --> 10:39.930
Listen. As I was saying,

10:39.970 --> 10:41.680
Des ran a check, okay,
on the guy that hit me

10:41.720 --> 10:42.350
with the truck.

10:43.220 --> 10:44.430
His name is Dante Peterson.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.180
Apparently he's some big,
you know,

10:47.230 --> 10:48.270
mineral exploration tycoon.

10:49.730 --> 10:52.690
Any idea how you could have made
an enemy out of a mining

10:52.730 --> 10:54.650
tycoon named Dante Peterson?

10:54.690 --> 10:55.610
How would I know?

10:55.650 --> 10:57.490
You meet so many
people every day,

10:57.530 --> 10:58.990
you're bound
to ruffle a few feathers.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.200
I'll call you back in a bit.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.240
All right.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.200
Ow b'y. Ow.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.830
Ow! Just go!

11:04.870 --> 11:07.370
Ahh. Jeez, b'y.
See?

11:07.410 --> 11:09.210
You see?
Now.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.920
Listen to me when I tells ya.
No--

11:11.960 --> 11:14.710
over-exertion.
We wanna keep you nice

11:14.750 --> 11:16.590
and calm and still--

11:16.630 --> 11:17.760
And safe.

11:19.050 --> 11:20.220
And eliminate all

11:20.260 --> 11:21.840
stress from your life.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.180
Now these pills.
Wow.

11:24.220 --> 11:25.560
I had to take these
when you got me shot.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.100
Do you remember
when you got me shot?

11:27.140 --> 11:29.310
Yes. Des.
I remember when I got you shot.

11:29.350 --> 11:30.270
And you almost died.

11:30.310 --> 11:31.520
It's okay.
It's okay, brother.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.150
That was ages ago,
when you got me shot.

11:33.190 --> 11:35.020
I don't know why you keep
bringing it up. Now.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.610
Just take a couple of those.

11:36.650 --> 11:38.030
Well, two pills, actually.

11:38.070 --> 11:40.240
Two pills will put you to sleep,
honestly.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.700
Okay, I don't know what that's
gonna do to you--

11:41.740 --> 11:42.820
That's...

11:45.910 --> 11:47.870
[Malachy] I can't help you if
you aren't straight with me.

11:47.910 --> 11:48.950
Just a sec.

11:56.750 --> 11:57.000
Got it.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.340
I got some stuff in here I need.

11:59.380 --> 12:00.470
[gunshot]

12:00.510 --> 12:01.430
Phonse!

12:01.880 --> 12:03.090
[gunshot]

12:03.140 --> 12:04.260
It's the same truck.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.430
That's gotta be
that Dante fella.

12:06.470 --> 12:08.010
Anything you wanna tell me now?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.680
I knew this was a bad idea.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.600
I can do this all day.

12:11.640 --> 12:12.690
[bang]

12:13.150 --> 12:14.310
[bang]

12:14.980 --> 12:16.150
[bang]

12:16.190 --> 12:18.980
Another gun? What are you?
An armory?

12:19.030 --> 12:19.900
[bang]

12:19.940 --> 12:21.360
Give me that,
you lunatic.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.490
[Dante] I'm not gonna stop
'til you give me that file.

12:23.530 --> 12:24.910
Out with it.
Tell me everything.

12:24.950 --> 12:26.240
Or I'll take my chances
with Dante.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.200
[bang]

12:27.240 --> 12:28.160
Are you crazy?

12:28.200 --> 12:28.830
This guy will kill us!

12:28.870 --> 12:30.330
You're lying to me.

12:30.370 --> 12:32.290
You have what seems like an
endless supply of fire arms.

12:32.330 --> 12:33.040
Not bad for a pacifist.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.420
[Dante]
Phonse!

12:34.460 --> 12:36.170
And this guy is obviously after
you for something.

12:36.210 --> 12:37.550
- Now what is it?
- Fine.

12:38.090 --> 12:38.420
[bang]

12:38.750 --> 12:40.130
[bang]

12:40.170 --> 12:43.550
Dante has been falsifying
his environmental samples.

12:43.590 --> 12:45.260
His mine is closing down

12:45.300 --> 12:46.430
and he wants to avoid

12:46.470 --> 12:49.520
a three hundred
million dollar cleanup.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.470
[bang]

12:50.520 --> 12:51.680
Here are the papers.

12:51.730 --> 12:52.640
[bang]

12:52.680 --> 12:53.940
See what you're making me do?

12:53.980 --> 12:55.020
[bang]

12:55.060 --> 12:56.560
What good is that file to you?

12:56.600 --> 13:00.190
I thought I could steal the
legit info and sell it back.

13:00.230 --> 13:02.150
Instead of paying you,
he wants to kill you.

13:02.190 --> 13:03.570
So why don't you just
give it back to him?

13:03.610 --> 13:05.990
I need the money to pay Eileen,
remember?

13:06.910 --> 13:08.830
[Dante]
I mean it, Phonse.

13:09.780 --> 13:11.410
[Malachy]
Get ready to run.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.130
[bang]

13:26.430 --> 13:28.550
[phone ringing]

13:33.560 --> 13:34.640
Uggh.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.080
Hello.

13:52.120 --> 13:52.910
Hello.

13:53.330 --> 13:54.330
Doyle.

13:55.580 --> 13:57.830
I have a way
of getting back at people

13:57.870 --> 13:59.590
who do me wrong.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.550
Aaagh!

14:05.510 --> 14:06.430
Arrgh!

14:06.470 --> 14:08.590
Ahh! My back.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.800
Fuddle duddle!

14:11.220 --> 14:14.310
- Why did you do that?
- Sorry. I, uh...

14:15.060 --> 14:16.480
I thought you were...

14:18.100 --> 14:19.730
I just had a really weird dream.

14:25.320 --> 14:26.280
[Des] That's okay.
Don't try and help.

14:27.820 --> 14:29.780
I think it must be the pills.
I let you down. I'm sorry.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.830
Des.
Those pills really messed me up.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.250
Ahhh.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.470
Ohhh.

14:53.850 --> 14:55.310
[Malachy] Phonse.
I love you. I do.

14:56.430 --> 15:00.100
But you have to promise.
No more lies.

15:00.140 --> 15:02.650
If you want me to help you,
we have to work together.

15:02.690 --> 15:03.690
I promise. Yes.

15:04.820 --> 15:07.900
But your handling of that fella.
Epic.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.410
Stop that.

15:14.620 --> 15:15.950
Phonse.

15:15.990 --> 15:18.410
You really need to learn
how to lay low.

15:18.450 --> 15:19.960
Hold on a second.
This is my house.

15:20.000 --> 15:20.920
You've no right--

15:20.960 --> 15:21.790
Ah!

15:22.880 --> 15:24.800
The thing I love about using
a cue.

15:25.340 --> 15:25.380
They're solid.

15:26.710 --> 15:28.880
Not solid enough to cause
any serious damage.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.470
Just enough to get
a point across.

15:30.880 --> 15:31.840
Now.

15:31.890 --> 15:34.140
This, on the other hand,

15:34.890 --> 15:36.060
drives the point home.

15:37.020 --> 15:37.930
Permanently.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.660
[Malachy]
Seriously, Phonse.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.070
If this keeps up,

15:53.110 --> 15:55.200
Rose in not gonna let me hang
out with you anymore.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.660
[Phonse]
Safe to say,

15:56.700 --> 15:59.960
Rose won't be fixing me up
with any of her hot friends.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.160
Speaking of hot--

16:01.210 --> 16:02.500
[Malachy]
Hey. Watch it.

16:02.540 --> 16:04.460
[Phonse]
Oh, she is, though, Mal.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.170
You always were
unfairly lucky

16:06.210 --> 16:08.760
when it came
to brilliant beautiful women.

16:11.510 --> 16:13.680
I'm glad the two of you think
this is so hilarious.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.510
Were the sacs really necessary?
I've been here a thousand times.

16:16.550 --> 16:19.520
Well, I was going for shock
value. Not subterfuge.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.310
Point made.
Point taken.

16:21.350 --> 16:23.650
Phonse is gonna find a way
to pay you back.

16:23.690 --> 16:24.730
So we'll be on our way.

16:24.770 --> 16:25.900
[Eileen]
You better settle in.

16:25.940 --> 16:27.690
Because we're gonna talk
payment options.

16:27.730 --> 16:29.070
And after you hear option one,

16:29.110 --> 16:30.490
immediate repayment,

16:31.820 --> 16:33.360
you aren't gonna like
your choices.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.200
Oh my God.
What happened here?

16:40.240 --> 16:42.750
I thought that Des was Maurice
Becker trying to kill me.

16:42.790 --> 16:44.000
So I threw him on the floor.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.540
Speaking of Maurice Becker,

16:45.580 --> 16:46.830
he is trying to kill me,
isn't he?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.290
Anything you want to share
with me about that?

16:48.340 --> 16:50.170
Probably not the best time
for that right now.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.210
Fine.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.800
Where's Father
and where's Phonse?

16:52.840 --> 16:54.840
I was hoping you would know.
The GTO is parked at the house.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.180
Des, hon,
where does it hurt?

16:57.220 --> 16:59.100
Ohh! Ahhh!

16:59.140 --> 17:02.230
Well, at first it felt like
my back was broken in half.

17:02.270 --> 17:03.810
And now, well,
it still feels that way.

17:03.850 --> 17:05.520
[Rose] Okay. Something
is not right here.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.860
Any idea where this came from?

17:11.320 --> 17:12.530
Where did you find this?

17:12.570 --> 17:13.650
In our kitchen.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.910
Hey Mal?

17:15.950 --> 17:17.700
I came home and the house was
a bit of a mess,

17:17.740 --> 17:18.990
like there was a struggle.

17:19.030 --> 17:19.540
Honey?

17:20.290 --> 17:21.580
That was on the floor.

17:23.830 --> 17:26.170
The logo on it looks like it's
for that pool hall.

17:26.210 --> 17:27.500
You know, Grooms,
on George Street?

17:27.540 --> 17:28.750
You know what?

17:28.790 --> 17:30.040
They run an underground
mahjong game there.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.630
That Chinese game
with that Dominos thing?

17:32.670 --> 17:35.010
Phonse was always one for
a bit of gambling.

17:35.050 --> 17:37.090
Eileen Jamieson.
Mal asked me to look into her.

17:37.140 --> 17:39.100
Phonse is in debt to her
big time.

17:39.140 --> 17:40.220
Maybe she came to collect.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.180
[Des]
Okay.

17:41.220 --> 17:42.770
It's time for your meds now.

17:42.810 --> 17:44.440
If I'm going to nurse you
back to health--

17:45.690 --> 17:47.100
I can't remember what I was
going to say.

17:47.150 --> 17:47.520
- Go away.
- I shall.

17:49.150 --> 17:50.980
Okay. You know what? We gotta
go check out this pool place.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.900
If Eileen is involved,
this could get bad.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.320
- Des, how's your back?
- [Des] Much better.

17:54.990 --> 17:55.780
I think, you know,

17:57.160 --> 17:59.660
I was probably just having
sympathy pains for Jake.

17:59.700 --> 18:01.660
I'm gonna go with you to
the pool hall, okay?

18:01.700 --> 18:05.000
I just need a few--

18:06.660 --> 18:08.040
Just close my eyes.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.210
Des. How many of these pills
have you taken?

18:10.250 --> 18:11.960
More than ten,
less than five.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.550
I feel great.

18:14.130 --> 18:15.970
[phone rings]

18:17.630 --> 18:18.720
[message sound]

18:22.180 --> 18:23.260
[Maurice] It's time for you to

18:23.310 --> 18:25.430
pay back that debt
you owe me, Doyle.

18:25.480 --> 18:25.930
Maurice Becker.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.270
You don't like me in here
rooting around, do you?

18:29.310 --> 18:31.480
I know exactly
why you're here.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.770
How did you figure this out?

18:32.820 --> 18:33.730
Who's the rat?

18:33.780 --> 18:34.690
Just tell me one thing.

18:34.730 --> 18:35.820
I'm as free as a bird.

18:35.860 --> 18:37.650
Free as a bird.
Free as a bird...

18:43.030 --> 18:44.160
The way I see it, Malachy,

18:44.200 --> 18:45.450
you're the good guy
in this situation.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.960
He is.
He really is.

18:47.870 --> 18:49.460
Although I can be very charming.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.710
And I gotta say, Eileen,

18:50.750 --> 18:51.750
I have other skills as well.

18:52.670 --> 18:54.300
And since you're the good guy,

18:54.340 --> 18:55.420
you're the one
I'm gonna set free.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.010
We both walk out of here
together.

18:57.050 --> 18:58.800
I'm not doing you any favors.

18:58.840 --> 19:00.430
You have a very important job.

19:00.470 --> 19:02.890
You're gonna get the money
that your idiot friend owes me.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.390
[Phonse] I'm not sure
I'd use the term idiot.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.150
And best friend
is a better way to describe

19:11.190 --> 19:12.400
our relationship.

19:12.440 --> 19:15.020
[Eileen] One hour. Or
Phonse loses his toes.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.070
And every hour after that.
Well--

19:17.110 --> 19:18.570
The human body only has
so many digits.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.360
And I'll cut them all off.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.160
When it comes to what order,

19:22.740 --> 19:24.240
I'll surprise you.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.160
How do you expect me to put
three hundred grand together

19:26.200 --> 19:26.240
in an hour?

19:27.540 --> 19:30.250
Ask Phonse.
Because my patience has run out.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.380
Clock starts in three,

19:34.920 --> 19:35.840
two...

19:35.880 --> 19:36.760
Oh. Ah!

19:38.010 --> 19:39.170
I'm sorry.

19:39.220 --> 19:40.680
What the hell are you doing?
We're closed.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.140
I'm sorry.
I was just--

19:42.180 --> 19:43.470
I was looking for the bathroom.

19:43.510 --> 19:45.180
I'm gonna try and help you,
okay?

19:45.220 --> 19:46.100
Sorry. Just--

19:47.350 --> 19:48.270
[bang]

19:48.730 --> 19:49.640
[punch]

19:53.560 --> 19:54.610
[Eileen]
Nice try.

19:54.650 --> 19:56.070
- [punch]
- Oh!

19:56.820 --> 19:57.730
Come on!

20:02.820 --> 20:03.820
Arrgh.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.160
Nice work son.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.210
You couldn't have
played that any better.

20:10.830 --> 20:12.790
Played?
Yes.

20:12.830 --> 20:14.630
Des, you were supposed to wait
for me to be in position.

20:14.670 --> 20:15.960
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Rose.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.710
I think it's these back pills.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.210
They've heightened
my sense of worry.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.550
And I was afraid that
Becker had sent --

20:21.590 --> 20:22.470
[Malachy]
Becker?

20:23.050 --> 20:24.050
Becker did what?

20:24.090 --> 20:25.720
He sent some

20:25.760 --> 20:27.850
baseball-wielding crazy
after Jake.

20:27.890 --> 20:28.810
And he laid him out.

20:28.850 --> 20:29.930
Phonse.

20:29.970 --> 20:31.480
You need to lay low,
back at your shed.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.480
It's a cabin.

20:32.520 --> 20:34.730
And wait.
You're coming too, right?

20:36.270 --> 20:39.530
[ring]

20:41.570 --> 20:42.610
[message sound]

20:47.330 --> 20:49.700
Hey. Hey.
You stand back, baby.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.790
Nikki. What the hell
are you doing here?

20:52.830 --> 20:54.210
- I thought you moved away.
- Shhh.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.670
I'm here to take care of you.

20:57.420 --> 20:58.840
Today I'm your doctor.

21:00.250 --> 21:01.920
And your wife.
Remember?

21:01.960 --> 21:04.180
I'm pretty sure we were
divorced. But--

21:05.720 --> 21:06.220
You were hit by a car,
Jake.

21:07.470 --> 21:09.390
You're too stubborn
to go to the hospital.

21:09.430 --> 21:11.770
And I will bring
the hospital to you.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.520
This'll get you hot, baby.

21:16.560 --> 21:19.980
Um, what are you doing?

21:20.020 --> 21:21.650
Your heart is defective,
Jake.

21:22.440 --> 21:22.990
I have to tell you--

21:23.860 --> 21:25.610
You were a terrible husband.

21:26.280 --> 21:27.280
You screwed it up.

21:28.030 --> 21:29.370
It's easier this way.

21:29.410 --> 21:30.410
- What?
- Shut up!

21:31.620 --> 21:33.080
After all,
you made a commitment to me too.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.330
And look how that worked out.

21:34.370 --> 21:35.330
Clear!

21:35.370 --> 21:36.290
What? Arrgh!

21:37.130 --> 21:39.250
[phone rings]

21:40.750 --> 21:42.090
Ahh!

21:42.130 --> 21:43.380
[ring]

21:43.420 --> 21:44.420
Ahhh.

21:45.430 --> 21:46.930
Man that was messed up.

21:47.430 --> 21:49.430
[ring]

22:00.570 --> 22:01.940
[buzz]

22:13.790 --> 22:16.370
Hope you don't mind
the fine aroma of a Cuban.

22:17.290 --> 22:19.380
Cigar, I mean, not the people.

22:19.420 --> 22:20.840
That would be a bit crude.

22:22.290 --> 22:25.050
Say I walk around smelling
Cuban people.

22:25.090 --> 22:27.180
Well, I have to say,
even through this glass,

22:28.470 --> 22:31.220
a cigar smells better than
the stench of you.

22:32.260 --> 22:33.770
I know what you did today.

22:34.930 --> 22:35.810
And your guy failed.

22:36.350 --> 22:37.730
Jake's alive.

22:37.770 --> 22:40.650
And you're one step closer
to being held accountable.

22:40.690 --> 22:41.980
He's still breathing.

22:43.770 --> 22:47.030
It's just that I hear
he's barely walking.

22:47.070 --> 22:50.450
That's one step closer
to finishing my objective.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.540
You think
you're untouchable in here?

22:54.450 --> 22:55.790
You think I can't get at you?

22:55.830 --> 22:56.830
Well you're wrong.

22:56.870 --> 22:57.870
Sure.
Sure Malachy.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.040
Some would say
I have connections.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.460
That I live better in here
than most people do

23:03.500 --> 23:04.880
on the outside.

23:07.260 --> 23:08.550
It's an exaggeration,
hey b'y.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.090
Doesn't matter who you know.

23:11.140 --> 23:12.890
I'll make sure
you go down for this.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.140
Yeah.

23:17.270 --> 23:20.520
Yeah. Alright. Well.
Good luck to you.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.270
And all your cops and robbers.

23:23.310 --> 23:25.030
I'm sure you'll get your man.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.610
Yeah.
No doubt.

23:47.170 --> 23:48.960
I shouldn't have
dragged you into this.

23:49.010 --> 23:51.760
Why don't the two of you
just get out now?

23:51.800 --> 23:53.430
I'll sort this out on my own.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.720
Did I ever tell you how
beautiful you are?

23:56.760 --> 23:57.970
Stop it buddy.
Okay?

23:58.020 --> 23:59.310
You know we're in this now.

23:59.350 --> 24:01.310
And you're Malachy's best
friend. So we gotta help.

24:01.350 --> 24:02.600
I'm sorry.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.650
I have this habit of hitting
on beautiful women

24:04.690 --> 24:05.230
when I'm nervous.

24:06.230 --> 24:09.360
And you are so,
so beautiful.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.650
See? I did it again.

24:10.690 --> 24:12.910
Phonse. We're all in this
together. Okay?

24:12.950 --> 24:14.870
If Mal likes you,
then we likes you.

24:14.910 --> 24:16.990
Okay? So we just gotta
come up with a way

24:17.030 --> 24:19.700
to raise
three hundred thousand dollars.

24:19.750 --> 24:20.870
Which I don't have.

24:20.910 --> 24:21.960
Bake sales.

24:22.750 --> 24:23.210
Surprisingly lucrative.

24:24.420 --> 24:27.710
Right. Listen.
I need more info on Dante.

24:27.750 --> 24:29.710
And why you stole his
environmental report.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.090
[Phonse]
They guy is lying.

24:31.130 --> 24:34.050
Defrauding everyone by
falsifying his findings.

24:34.090 --> 24:35.800
When he closes up his mine,

24:35.840 --> 24:38.350
he'll leave behind enough
contaminated soil

24:38.390 --> 24:39.720
to choke us all.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.850
You can't prove fraud
and cover up if you're dead.

24:41.890 --> 24:43.600
Why don't we just
give him his file back?

24:43.640 --> 24:45.770
And then you can nail him
on the fraud after he stops

24:45.810 --> 24:47.730
trying
to kill you and stuff.

24:47.770 --> 24:49.650
I guess we don't have
any other choice.

24:49.690 --> 24:51.110
So where is this folder

24:51.150 --> 24:53.030
with the environmental
report in it?

24:54.570 --> 24:55.450
Oh no.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.280
No!

24:57.330 --> 24:58.410
My messenger bag.

24:58.450 --> 24:59.580
Eileen must have it.

24:59.620 --> 25:01.200
See, she is so hot,

25:01.250 --> 25:05.120
I lost my--you know--
my edge.

25:05.170 --> 25:09.750
Okay. You left the bag behind in
a homicidal woman's pool hall

25:09.800 --> 25:12.300
with the environmental
report inside?

25:12.340 --> 25:13.760
[ring]

25:14.590 --> 25:16.260
- Hello?
- How's Phonse?

25:16.300 --> 25:18.350
Well, he's alive
and incompetent.

25:18.390 --> 25:20.180
He misplaced the report.

25:20.770 --> 25:21.810
How's the pen?

25:21.850 --> 25:23.020
Becker's up to something.

25:23.060 --> 25:24.770
I don't know what.
But I'm gonna find out.

25:24.810 --> 25:26.810
- [beep]
- Hold on. Another call.

25:27.440 --> 25:28.610
Malachy Doyle.

25:28.650 --> 25:30.150
That's some move you pulled
with the steam

25:30.190 --> 25:31.150
back in the parking garage.

25:32.150 --> 25:34.070
I think I owe you
for that one.

25:34.110 --> 25:35.900
Honestly,
I'm surprised that it worked.

25:35.950 --> 25:38.030
Because everything I hear, is
you're some kind of hotshot.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.530
Well you're gonna see
what I'm capable of

25:39.580 --> 25:42.200
if I don't
get my folder back. Now.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.540
- We don't have it. - Don't play games with me.

25:44.580 --> 25:46.790
I'm not kidding. We don't
have your folder anymore.

25:47.670 --> 25:49.290
Fine.
Whatever you say.

25:49.330 --> 25:51.250
In another minute,
Phonse won't be a problem

25:51.300 --> 25:52.920
for me anymore, anyway.

25:59.640 --> 26:02.390
Oh. Phonse!
Get away from the shed!

26:02.430 --> 26:03.980
[Phonse] I don't know if
Malachy mentioned it,

26:04.020 --> 26:04.890
but it's a cabin.

26:05.350 --> 26:06.230
[crash]

26:06.810 --> 26:08.060
Rose?

26:08.100 --> 26:09.360
Talk to me.

26:23.450 --> 26:25.410
It's easier this way, Jake.

26:28.290 --> 26:30.040
It's easier this way, Jake.

26:30.590 --> 26:31.540
She's right.

26:32.840 --> 26:33.840
Ha.

26:36.170 --> 26:37.880
[ring]

26:38.760 --> 26:39.840
[sound of message on phone]

26:47.600 --> 26:48.730
[Phonse]
My cabin.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.150
I loved that cabin.

26:51.190 --> 26:54.230
Yeah. We had a lot of good times
there, didn't we.

26:54.270 --> 26:57.320
Man. This place is like
mission control.

26:57.360 --> 27:01.030
Malachy. You are so much cooler
than I gave you credit for.

27:01.070 --> 27:02.410
I always thought you were cool.

27:02.450 --> 27:04.910
Thanks. Des, I fiddled with
their power.

27:05.950 --> 27:07.660
You be ready to intercept
the call.

27:07.700 --> 27:10.420
Phonse. Keep your eyes
glued on the monitors.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.420
I wanna know if you see anyone
coming or going.

27:12.460 --> 27:13.920
Copy that Night Eagle.

27:13.960 --> 27:14.880
Dark Winged Charlie.

27:15.550 --> 27:15.960
Ready and waiting.

27:17.130 --> 27:18.800
Are you messed up
on those pills again?

27:18.840 --> 27:20.300
No. No. No.

27:20.340 --> 27:22.760
I'm good to go.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.390
I hope Rose is okay in there.

27:27.310 --> 27:28.350
Okay. Okay.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.200
Ha-- Pung!

27:49.290 --> 27:50.660
[Rose]
Hey!

27:50.710 --> 27:52.080
What are you guys
trying to pull here?

27:52.120 --> 27:54.080
This is the best hand
I've had all night.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.590
Everyone hold on to your tiles.

27:55.630 --> 27:58.050
We'll get this sorted out as
soon as the power's back on.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.680
Atlantic Hydro.

28:04.720 --> 28:07.720
How may I help you this evening,
my love?

28:07.760 --> 28:09.560
Yes. The power at my business
went down.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.100
And I've got some--

28:11.140 --> 28:13.190
We're in the middle of some very
important business.

28:13.230 --> 28:15.270
And I need -
I need lights back on.

28:15.310 --> 28:19.610
Yeah. We got spikes all over
the grids, see?

28:19.650 --> 28:22.030
Making people have
the blackouts.

28:22.070 --> 28:23.200
Right.
Where are you too?

28:23.240 --> 28:24.490
Ah, 35 George Street.

28:24.530 --> 28:26.620
Deadly.
We got one of the b'ys--

28:26.660 --> 28:28.290
One of our, uh,

28:29.580 --> 28:31.620
light and power b'ys
in that area right now.

28:32.330 --> 28:33.920
Hurry it up, please.

28:33.960 --> 28:36.000
We're on it.
No sweat, my lover, ma'am.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.000
B'y.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.630
Wish me luck Night Eagle.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.180
Night Eagle Two.

28:50.430 --> 28:52.140
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Just sit tight.

28:52.180 --> 28:53.810
They're sending
a technician now.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.690
Atlantic Hydro, ma'am.
You having trouble

28:59.730 --> 29:00.900
with your lights?
Eh, b'y?

29:00.940 --> 29:03.320
Yes. And hurry up.
I've got people waiting.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.820
Wait. Is that you
I spoke to on the phone?

29:05.870 --> 29:07.330
You look familiar.

29:07.370 --> 29:08.910
No. No, that was

29:08.950 --> 29:10.950
Earl.
He's from...

29:11.620 --> 29:13.290
Somalia...
Bay.

29:14.250 --> 29:16.000
And I'm from
The Goulds. So...

29:16.040 --> 29:17.290
Hello!
Now.

29:17.330 --> 29:18.790
I'll have to take a look around

29:18.840 --> 29:20.920
and find the power box.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.010
Or I can show
you where it is.

29:22.050 --> 29:24.880
Okay. I assume
it's probably in here.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.510
No, it's back that way.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.060
[Eileen] Will you hurry up, please?

29:32.100 --> 29:34.440
[Des] You can't hurry
genius, my love.

29:34.480 --> 29:37.440
Just fix the lights.
And--

29:38.730 --> 29:40.820
Forget anything
you may or may not see here.

29:40.860 --> 29:42.030
Got me?

29:42.070 --> 29:44.990
Okay, you're right.
I'll fix them there now.

29:45.030 --> 29:46.870
Shouldn't be a problem at all.

29:48.070 --> 29:51.330
Oh. Look.
It must have been one of them

29:51.370 --> 29:53.330
intermittent defects.

29:53.370 --> 29:56.210
One of the crews outside
probably

29:56.250 --> 29:58.380
got her fixed up.
So I'll just be--

29:58.420 --> 29:59.590
on my way.

29:59.630 --> 30:00.920
Oh oh!

30:00.960 --> 30:02.710
- Sorry.
- What is the matter with you?

30:02.760 --> 30:03.970
This isn't
the seventh grade dance.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.050
Get off of me!

30:05.090 --> 30:06.550
Ah...
Okay. I haven't uh...

30:08.890 --> 30:10.510
Out. Now.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.360
I've never felt so alive.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.570
Now I know what it feels like

30:23.610 --> 30:25.570
to stare danger
right in the face.

30:25.610 --> 30:26.910
And danger--?

30:27.570 --> 30:28.610
She blinked first.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.490
Des.
What's the situation in there?

30:30.530 --> 30:32.660
What?
Oh, the bag is

30:32.700 --> 30:34.290
locked up tight
in the back office.

30:34.330 --> 30:35.960
I had a chance.
I should have grabbed it.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.040
Damn it!

30:40.290 --> 30:42.340
Now what the hell
are we gonna do?

30:42.380 --> 30:43.670
No. No, no, no.
Wait.

30:44.420 --> 30:46.630
I did manage to get --

30:47.050 --> 30:48.050
this.

30:48.090 --> 30:48.970
Nice work Des.

30:50.140 --> 30:53.720
Phonse.
Let's go with our backup plan.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.970
Go take care of your part.
You know where she's parked?

30:56.020 --> 30:57.890
I am gonna take
great pleasure in this.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.310
Good luck in there Malachy.

30:59.350 --> 31:01.980
Just make sure you disappear
before Eileen shows up.

31:02.020 --> 31:04.280
The last thing we need is for
her to get her hands on you.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.070
Got it.

31:06.030 --> 31:10.370
She is hot.
Phonse was right.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.080
Good work.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.000
You guys are cheaters.

31:21.460 --> 31:22.540
I knew it.

31:22.580 --> 31:24.420
This games been rigged
from the start.

31:24.460 --> 31:26.130
We run a clean game here.
Calm down.

31:26.170 --> 31:27.380
Don't tell me to calm down.

31:27.420 --> 31:29.050
The light go out.
And when they come back on.

31:29.090 --> 31:31.090
Suddenly all my tiles
have been switched.

31:31.140 --> 31:31.430
That's enough out of you.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.220
Pack up your stuff
and get out of my place.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.220
Oh.
That's ridiculous.

31:35.850 --> 31:36.850
They're cheating.

31:36.890 --> 31:38.350
And I'm the one
being thrown out.

31:39.190 --> 31:41.100
[car alarm goes off]

31:42.060 --> 31:43.940
That's my car.
What else?

31:43.980 --> 31:45.440
Get rid of her.
Pronto.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.650
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

31:47.690 --> 31:50.200
Come on. I was just about
to go on a hot streak.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.530
I could feel it.

31:51.570 --> 31:52.950
Don't touch me!

31:53.370 --> 31:54.620
Stop it.

31:54.660 --> 31:55.580
Okay?

31:55.620 --> 31:56.660
Got it?
Good.

31:57.250 --> 31:59.290
I'm going. Okay.

31:59.330 --> 32:00.670
Just don't touch me.

32:01.540 --> 32:03.080
I always find another game.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.090
Besides, this place smells
like feet.

32:05.130 --> 32:07.300
[phone rings]

32:12.180 --> 32:13.050
[message sound]

32:14.760 --> 32:15.600
Oh. Hey Leslie.

32:16.470 --> 32:17.720
How long have I been asleep?

32:19.810 --> 32:21.140
Finally, you're awake.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.940
I was getting so bored.

32:22.980 --> 32:24.310
Allison. What are you doing
here? You have to leave.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.860
Jake. Come on.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.110
It could be even better than
it was when we were a couple.

32:28.150 --> 32:29.360
How did you even get in here?

32:29.400 --> 32:31.280
Well, you let me in.

32:31.320 --> 32:33.030
Right after you called me.

32:33.070 --> 32:34.240
Remember Jake?

32:34.280 --> 32:36.080
I let you in?
What are you talking about?

32:36.950 --> 32:37.830
What are you talking about?

32:38.410 --> 32:39.830
Jake. Come on.

32:39.870 --> 32:42.080
Do you really think that you're
ready for another woman?

32:43.330 --> 32:46.290
I mean, honestly.
Like, really ready, ready?

32:47.170 --> 32:48.960
You will never settle down.

32:50.210 --> 32:52.430
It's just not in your makeup.
It's just--

32:53.510 --> 32:56.010
Commitment's not your thing,
Jake.

32:56.050 --> 32:57.100
Sorry.

32:57.680 --> 32:58.680
Uggh.

33:02.640 --> 33:03.390
Oh God.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.020
I didn't think you were ever
gonna wake up.

33:06.650 --> 33:08.610
You are a sight

33:09.980 --> 33:11.490
for-- you know--
sore ribs.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.910
Chicken soup
is more of a cold-flu food.

33:15.820 --> 33:17.200
But I made you some anyway.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.870
That was very sweet of you.

33:23.620 --> 33:24.790
Can you kiss me again?

33:24.830 --> 33:26.250
I've been having
really weird dreams lately.

33:26.290 --> 33:28.630
I just want to make sure that
you're, you know, real.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.630
How's this for real?

33:34.130 --> 33:35.590
I'm convinced.

33:35.630 --> 33:37.510
I heard about how this happened.

33:38.550 --> 33:39.970
Rose told me
it was case-related.

33:40.010 --> 33:42.140
But I know Becker was involved.

33:42.890 --> 33:43.940
It was nothing.

33:46.440 --> 33:47.060
What?

33:48.060 --> 33:48.400
The cops
have taken this over now?

33:49.770 --> 33:52.900
You know, we've been doing
pretty good, you and me.

33:52.940 --> 33:54.650
Not stepping on each other's
toes with stuff like this.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.570
You want me to back off?

33:57.110 --> 33:58.570
Not exactly.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.580
Well, if you don't want me
to back off, what's the catch?

34:00.620 --> 34:01.080
No catch. Just--

34:02.040 --> 34:03.330
Next time you're
visiting Becker?

34:04.330 --> 34:05.580
There's something
you should know.

34:12.590 --> 34:16.470
You sneaky, sneaky, sneaky.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.850
That is very clever.

34:21.470 --> 34:23.180
Thank you for this.
You know--

34:25.100 --> 34:27.980
I'm starting to feel like my
ribs are a little bit better.

34:28.020 --> 34:28.310
Just rest up.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.320
We'll talk more about this
when you're better.

34:39.030 --> 34:39.700
[Rose]
Hey.

34:40.320 --> 34:41.580
Did you get it?

34:42.700 --> 34:43.700
Deadly!

34:43.740 --> 34:44.750
We're kind of like
Mission Possible.

34:45.370 --> 34:46.250
Where's Phonse?

34:47.500 --> 34:47.790
I thought he was with you.

34:47.830 --> 34:49.460
No.

34:49.500 --> 34:52.000
He knew we were all supposed to
meet here after we got the bag.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.670
I'll go check upstairs.

34:53.710 --> 34:54.630
The file's here.

34:54.670 --> 34:55.590
[ring]

34:55.630 --> 34:56.590
There he is.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.180
Phonse.
Where are you?

34:59.220 --> 35:01.390
That was some operation
you all just pulled.

35:01.430 --> 35:02.550
You should be proud.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.720
- Where's Phonse?
- He's here.

35:04.680 --> 35:05.890
After a little bit of prodding,

35:05.930 --> 35:07.850
he told me a fascinating story
about a folder

35:07.890 --> 35:09.440
and a messenger bag.

35:09.480 --> 35:11.770
I figure it's worth millions
in blackmail money.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.780
If you kill him,
I swear on my life I'll--

35:14.820 --> 35:16.110
Why would I kill him?

35:16.150 --> 35:17.490
He's great leverage.
For now.

35:18.780 --> 35:20.610
And I've even agreed
to forgive his debt,

35:20.660 --> 35:21.870
if you bring that folder here,

35:22.370 --> 35:23.240
right now.

35:26.660 --> 35:28.370
I guess we're going back
to the pool hall.

35:28.410 --> 35:29.620
Is he okay?

35:29.670 --> 35:31.580
For now.
But not for long.

35:32.580 --> 35:33.960
[Dante]
Enough playing around.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.380
Where's my file?

35:41.630 --> 35:43.510
Everything I've worked for,
my entire life.

35:44.640 --> 35:47.100
My entire empire
depends on that file.

35:47.140 --> 35:48.730
So if you think
I won't kill for it,

35:48.770 --> 35:50.390
you haven't been
paying attention.

35:50.440 --> 35:51.560
We don't have it.

35:52.020 --> 35:52.650
Bull.

35:53.690 --> 35:55.190
Really we don't.
Malachy, tell him.

35:55.230 --> 35:56.570
It's in the hands
of Eileen Jamieson.

35:56.610 --> 35:58.150
She runs a pool hall
on George Street.

35:58.900 --> 35:59.400
Why would I believe you?

36:00.610 --> 36:02.820
Because you're pointing
a gun in my face?

36:03.570 --> 36:04.450
Fine.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.040
Two of you.

36:07.080 --> 36:08.620
Show me this pool place.

36:08.660 --> 36:09.540
But if the file isn't there,

36:10.410 --> 36:11.790
she takes the first bullet.

36:11.830 --> 36:13.460
Okay.
No need for that.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.840
We all want the same thing here.

36:14.880 --> 36:15.750
Move it.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.530
[Leslie] Des. What do you want?

36:46.200 --> 36:47.490
[Eileen]
What's this now?

36:47.530 --> 36:48.990
I didn't say you could bring
a friend with a gun.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.620
Trust me.
He's no friend of ours.

36:51.660 --> 36:53.620
I hear you have something that
belongs to me.

36:53.670 --> 36:56.540
- What, Phonse?
- No, Stupid. My file.

36:56.590 --> 36:58.040
I want my file.
Now.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.630
Hey. Watch who you're calling
stupid, you jerk.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.760
I don't have your file.

37:03.510 --> 37:04.720
What's the game here?

37:05.550 --> 37:06.350
What did I say?

37:07.220 --> 37:08.470
She takes the first bullet.

37:08.510 --> 37:10.180
No, no, no.
Wait! Wait!

37:10.220 --> 37:11.930
This is your fault, Phonse.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.940
First you almost
shoot her yourself.

37:13.980 --> 37:15.230
Now your friends
are gonna finish the job.

37:15.270 --> 37:16.440
But Mal--
They're not my--

37:16.480 --> 37:18.150
This is worse than that time
with Stetson.

37:18.190 --> 37:19.980
Except without those
women's boyfriends.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.820
Oh, you're bringing that up
again, are you?

37:21.860 --> 37:23.990
I should take your head off,
do the world a favor.

37:24.030 --> 37:26.200
You couldn't take my head off.

37:26.240 --> 37:28.330
You're not man enough.
You never were.

37:28.370 --> 37:29.580
We'll see about that.

37:29.620 --> 37:30.660
Whoa!

37:32.200 --> 37:33.330
[crash]

37:34.080 --> 37:35.210
Oh!

37:40.800 --> 37:42.090
- Nice work, Mal!
- Thanks.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.130
Did you get the other gun?

37:44.170 --> 37:45.050
Oh no.

37:45.590 --> 37:46.510
Fine.

37:46.550 --> 37:48.140
- Have it your way.
- Rose!

37:48.180 --> 37:49.180
- [gunshot]
- Ohhh!

37:49.760 --> 37:51.310
[police siren]

37:52.060 --> 37:53.270
[Leslie]
Both of you.

37:53.310 --> 37:54.890
Hands where I can see 'em.

37:58.020 --> 37:59.610
Good work Des.
Call an ambulance.

37:59.650 --> 38:00.860
Thanks.
I woulda been here quicker.

38:00.900 --> 38:02.440
But I had to breath
into a paper bag

38:02.480 --> 38:03.990
for a minute
before I could talk.

38:04.900 --> 38:05.820
Leslie.

38:05.860 --> 38:07.240
You're gonna need this.

38:14.120 --> 38:15.540
I have to admit.
At first I wasn't

38:15.580 --> 38:17.170
super
sure what to make of you.

38:17.210 --> 38:17.670
I get that a lot.

38:19.250 --> 38:21.290
It was clear to me that you
might put Malachy in jeopardy.

38:21.340 --> 38:23.340
So I was a little apprehensive
about trusting you.

38:23.380 --> 38:24.550
And now?

38:24.590 --> 38:25.010
Phonse.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.130
You took a bullet for me.

38:28.760 --> 38:31.810
I don't think you can get much
more trustworthy than that. So--

38:31.850 --> 38:33.850
- Thank you.
- They say it hit a kidney.

38:33.890 --> 38:35.270
But hey.
That's why we have two.

38:36.190 --> 38:38.020
Shouldn't leave too much damage.

38:38.060 --> 38:39.940
Cool scar to show the ladies.

38:39.980 --> 38:40.650
Oh right.

38:41.190 --> 38:42.150
Speaking of.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.230
Do you have a sister?

38:44.280 --> 38:45.650
Ha. Ha. Trust me.

38:45.690 --> 38:47.030
You do not want to go there.

38:50.570 --> 38:51.740
Thanks again for the save.

38:51.780 --> 38:52.370
No worries.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.080
There's something
we need to talk about.

38:55.830 --> 38:57.540
Jake knows about Becker.

38:58.290 --> 38:59.330
I see.

39:12.390 --> 39:13.640
Hi there.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.180
I'd like to say it was good
to see you, Doyle.

39:16.230 --> 39:17.140
But it isn't.

39:18.810 --> 39:20.060
Having that guy,
you know,

39:20.100 --> 39:22.060
try to kill me was a bit
extreme, don't you think?

39:23.190 --> 39:24.230
Either way.

39:24.270 --> 39:25.190
It didn't work.

39:25.230 --> 39:26.240
I'm not dead.

39:27.030 --> 39:27.700
Like I told your father--

39:29.150 --> 39:31.740
I haven't the foggiest idea what
you're talking about.

39:31.780 --> 39:32.740
Of course you don't.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.410
You know, maybe

39:35.450 --> 39:37.410
you just don't have
the kind of power in here

39:37.450 --> 39:37.870
that everyone thinks
that you do.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.420
I don't know why
the high quality of life

39:42.460 --> 39:43.880
that I have in here

39:43.920 --> 39:47.090
is connected with any perceived
attempt on your life.

39:47.590 --> 39:48.840
I'm just saying.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.470
It's one thing to be able
to smoke that cigar

39:50.510 --> 39:51.390
whenever you wants to.

39:52.340 --> 39:53.350
And it's another thing entirely

39:54.470 --> 39:57.520
to be able to speak,
you know, freely.

39:58.890 --> 40:04.520
Doyle. Behind these walls,
I can get anything.

40:04.570 --> 40:05.610
Do anything.

40:05.650 --> 40:07.650
And I could certainly
say anything.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.530
Maybe.
But I can walk out of here.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.370
And you can't.

40:15.870 --> 40:16.790
Not yet.

40:17.830 --> 40:18.580
I'm in here because of you.

40:19.910 --> 40:22.040
And you can't seem to stay out
of my business.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.710
So forgive me,
if I exact revenge

40:26.340 --> 40:27.460
any way I choose.

40:28.210 --> 40:29.630
The b'ys that you hired?

40:31.380 --> 40:32.630
They were a bunch of morons.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.050
Good help is hard to find.

40:34.930 --> 40:36.350
I had to get whoever I could

40:36.390 --> 40:38.970
to take you out.
I had the

40:39.020 --> 40:41.190
perfect diamond score.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.150
And you shagged it up.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.150
I know.
Cool what?

40:46.190 --> 40:47.820
And you're gonna have
to pay for it.

40:49.030 --> 40:52.820
I'll get you killed,
Doyle.

40:52.860 --> 40:53.740
Make no mistake.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.490
I will succeed.

40:56.580 --> 40:59.200
That's an excellent
little speech.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.080
I can't wait to
listen to it again.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.710
That wouldn't pick up
the puny signal

41:06.750 --> 41:09.050
from these cheap phone
receivers.

41:09.090 --> 41:10.970
Get me back to my cell.

41:12.220 --> 41:13.260
Now.

41:16.890 --> 41:18.100
[Jake] Yeah. You're right.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.680
The sound in those bugs.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.520
They come in pretty clear.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.020
Look Maurice.
Recognize him?

41:25.440 --> 41:27.980
He's been undercover
watching you for a long time.

41:38.740 --> 41:40.240
That won't change anything.

41:40.290 --> 41:41.830
Except maybe your sentence.

41:41.870 --> 41:43.500
What you do you think?
That little story of yours,

41:43.540 --> 41:45.670
probably be another five,
ten years.

41:47.040 --> 41:49.250
This is not your best idea,
Doyle.

41:50.500 --> 41:53.880
Never anger a man who has
nothing to lose.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.340
What are you gonna do?

41:55.380 --> 41:55.550
Tunnel after me?

41:57.090 --> 42:00.640
Although I suppose with all this
extra time on your hands,

42:00.680 --> 42:02.220
you'll probably be able
to make that happen.

42:02.270 --> 42:04.020
Nothing to lose Doyle!

42:05.690 --> 42:06.690
Remember that!

42:26.960 --> 42:27.920
[buzz]
