00:07.241 --> 00:09.508
(theme music)

00:32.199 --> 00:33.999
(♪)

00:47.782 --> 00:49.548
(julia): What about here?

00:50.551 --> 00:52.885
- Perhaps a spot with
more shade?

00:52.887 --> 00:55.954
- Ah. A little bit of sun
is good for the body.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.756
At least for the soul.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.424
- What if susannah gets
too warm?

00:59.427 --> 01:00.925
- Well, then we'll move her!

01:01.629 --> 01:02.895
This is a perfect spot.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.567
- Wherever is he?

01:08.569 --> 01:10.435
- I want to put my eyes
on that machine of his.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.237
- The infamous falcon.

01:12.372 --> 01:14.105
- Well, that blasted thing
has taken him so long,

01:14.141 --> 01:16.040
It better have wings.
- If you want wings,

01:16.077 --> 01:18.376
Go play with
aubrey welford-crossley

01:18.378 --> 01:19.711
And his flying machine.

01:19.847 --> 01:20.913
- Ah! Deedee.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.182
Deedee, where's your husband?

01:23.317 --> 01:24.650
We want to see
this motorcycle already.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.319
- Patience, gentlemen.
The falcon will be worth
the wait.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.322
(engine revving)
- wowee! What did I tell you?

01:30.324 --> 01:32.057
- Let's go!
Let's go see what it can do!

01:32.059 --> 01:35.093
(♪)

02:06.127 --> 02:07.559
(murdoch): Ooh.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.228
I received a letter
from harry this morning.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.631
- Oh? And how is he faring
at boarding school?

02:12.700 --> 02:15.100
- Quite well.
According to him.

02:15.235 --> 02:18.102
The accompanying letter
from his mother

02:18.139 --> 02:21.440
Says that he was almost expelled

02:21.575 --> 02:24.509
For sneaking out to see girls.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.044
- Ah!

02:26.180 --> 02:28.647
A lothario like his father.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.782
(chuckles)

02:30.851 --> 02:32.450
Did we forget the melon?

02:33.487 --> 02:36.521
- No, no! It's right here
in the ice box.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.523
(engine revving
in the distance)

02:37.658 --> 02:38.756
Ah!

02:38.792 --> 02:40.792
(crashing, screaming)

02:40.928 --> 02:42.527
- What on earth was that?

02:45.666 --> 02:46.865
(sighs)

02:46.934 --> 02:48.867
(revving)

02:49.537 --> 02:51.470
(intriguing music)

02:59.746 --> 03:00.812
- Where did he go?

03:00.814 --> 03:01.947
- I haven't the foggiest.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.816
Look.

03:06.887 --> 03:07.952
(deedee): Ellsworth?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.021
Ellie?

03:11.926 --> 03:14.092
(♪)

03:16.497 --> 03:17.662
No.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.598
(sobbing)
it can't be.

03:22.302 --> 03:23.534
(julia): Dear god.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.804
(wind whistling)

03:27.774 --> 03:28.807
He's dead.

03:28.876 --> 03:29.807
- Oh!

03:30.844 --> 03:32.577
He must have gone
straight off the cliff!

03:33.080 --> 03:34.178
(sighs)

03:34.215 --> 03:35.981
- Well, it's sooner
than I would have hoped,

03:36.050 --> 03:39.183
But susannah was bound to see
a dead body eventually.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.820
(♪)

03:45.960 --> 03:47.859
(wind whistling)

03:47.928 --> 03:50.261
Well, mrs. Hart will have
her work cut out for her.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.597
- Significant injuries
to the body.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.200
- Yes. It's almost as if
he fell off a cliff.

03:57.238 --> 03:58.904
- His motorcycle's
in a shambles.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.539
- It's a horrific accident.
I wonder what happened?

04:03.010 --> 04:05.009
(murdoch): I suppose we'll have
to chat with his compatriots.

04:07.114 --> 04:10.148
- Ellsworth drummond.
The man was a legend.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.216
(indistinct chatter)
- in what sense?

04:11.218 --> 04:12.284
- In every sense.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.885
He locked himself in
his garage

04:13.954 --> 04:15.820
Building that motorcycle
these last two years.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.156
- A recluse and a genius.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.490
- How did you know him?

04:20.160 --> 04:21.092
- We know his wife.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.527
She's a member
of our motoring club.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.163
(coulter): We tour about
on our motorcycles.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.299
- Where do you go?

04:27.301 --> 04:30.569
- We don't go anywhere per se.
We just go.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.437
(fink): For fun.

04:32.572 --> 04:35.173
- Today, mind you,
was a special occasion.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.242
Deedee called us round
to see the falcon.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.711
- Falcon?

04:39.747 --> 04:41.980
- The motorcycle
her husband's been working on.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.250
- It was finally ready
for its first demonstration run.

04:45.385 --> 04:47.319
- Alas, ready it was not.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.021
(sobbing)
- I'm sorry.

04:53.193 --> 04:55.661
(intriguing music)

04:56.497 --> 04:57.862
(sobbing)
(fink): Deedee...

04:58.465 --> 05:00.231
I'm so sorry.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.468
(deedee): Thank you.
- His wife's overcome.

05:03.603 --> 05:07.205
- Her husband rode
his motorcycle off of a cliff.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.274
There were no signs
of braking or swerving.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.310
- You think he did it
intentionally?

05:12.445 --> 05:13.578
(sighs)

05:13.580 --> 05:16.014
- It's certainly a unique way
to take one's life.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.351
Did she say anything
that would indicate

05:19.486 --> 05:21.753
He intended to do
something like this?

05:21.888 --> 05:22.954
(julia): Not at all.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.489
It was his great unveiling.

05:24.624 --> 05:25.957
The best day of his life,
she said.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.093
(fink): If there's anything
that we can do...

05:28.095 --> 05:29.694
Just let us know.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.896
(city hubbub)

05:33.900 --> 05:35.767
(brackenreid): So, he rode off
the side of a cliff?

05:36.303 --> 05:37.302
Yes.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.505
And I need to determine
if it was rider error,

05:40.507 --> 05:43.174
Or a failing
of the motorcycle itself.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.709
- Like the brakes not working?

05:44.778 --> 05:46.444
- Or being tampered with.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.580
- Bloody nuisance, these.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.516
Too loud, even with
these new exhaust mufflers.

05:52.586 --> 05:53.985
- I don't know, inspector.
I like them.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.587
They're rather fast.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.389
- Oh, no.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.723
- What?

05:58.759 --> 06:01.325
- Julia, you aren't thinking
of riding a motorcycle?

06:02.129 --> 06:03.694
- Not very ladylike, doctor.

06:05.299 --> 06:06.932
- Are you two telling me
what to do?

06:07.067 --> 06:08.666
- Damn right we are!

06:08.702 --> 06:10.302
- N...No. No!

06:10.304 --> 06:13.872
No, it's just
they are very dangerous;

06:14.007 --> 06:16.074
Our current case
proves that.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.443
- Well, yes, if you ride them
off a cliff!

06:18.445 --> 06:20.178
- So, what about the brakes?

06:20.247 --> 06:23.081
- Unfortunately,
the damage is significant

06:23.150 --> 06:26.618
And there are mechanisms
that I am not familiar with.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.621
- Well, by all accounts,
it's a revolutionary design.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.223
- Which I need to learn
more about.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.993
(deedee): My husband had been
working on the falcon for years.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.897
It was perfect,
he was sure of it.

06:40.234 --> 06:43.435
- Who besides mr. Drummond
knew of the falcon's designs?

06:44.438 --> 06:46.905
- Well, there was
an article about it

06:46.907 --> 06:48.473
In<i> popular mechanics.</i>

06:49.309 --> 06:50.976
- Oh! What did the article say?

06:52.179 --> 06:54.379
- It was only a photograph
and an announcement.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.013
Ellsworth wouldn't let
the writer

06:56.049 --> 06:58.450
So much as lay eyes
on the falcon.

06:58.452 --> 07:01.118
He was so careful about
his designs being stolen.

07:01.155 --> 07:04.121
- Mm. Well, surely
he trusted you with his secrets.

07:04.158 --> 07:06.591
- Ah, he trusted me, yes.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.793
But I'm hardly
a motorcycle builder.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.396
I know nothing
about the falcon's designs.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.532
His motorcycle
was everything to him.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.802
It was his whole world
and now...

07:19.006 --> 07:21.173
- Yes, I'm terribly
sorry for your loss.

07:21.308 --> 07:22.607
- Thank you.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.808
- With your permission,

07:23.811 --> 07:25.944
I would like to have
a look in his workshop.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.378
- Of course.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.113
What are you hoping to find?

07:29.716 --> 07:31.483
- Parts, drawings.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.817
Anything that will help me
understand

07:32.886 --> 07:34.219
How the motorcycle worked

07:34.288 --> 07:37.355
In the hopes of understanding
what may have gone wrong.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.793
When did this happen,
mrs. Drummond?

07:43.997 --> 07:45.796
(♪)

07:49.169 --> 07:50.635
- Ah, I haven't the slightest.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.173
- This blood appears
to be fresh.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.876
It seems as though
someone has broken in.

08:10.524 --> 08:11.790
(artie): We should have called
before we came.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.725
- And have him duck us again?
- It's only polite.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.193
- Oh, artie, you're such a bore.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.862
You there.
Are you ellsworth drummond?

08:17.431 --> 08:18.730
- I am not.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.533
- You see?
This is why we don't call.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.434
The man tries to duck us again.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.069
Now, look here, drummond--
- billy, look at this!

08:26.106 --> 08:27.872
An injection line
behind the intake.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.073
(sighs)

08:30.410 --> 08:32.143
<i> - Mamma mia!</i>

08:32.179 --> 08:34.112
You're a clever sort,
aren't you, drummond?

08:34.247 --> 08:36.881
But who cares about this,
anyway? Where's the falcon?

08:38.018 --> 08:40.485
- Gentlemen, I... I truly am not
mr. Drummond.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.087
This morning,
both he and the falcon

08:43.123 --> 08:45.423
Met their unfortunate end
at the bottom of a cliff.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.025
- He rode it off a cliff?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.826
Oh dear.

08:48.828 --> 08:51.228
- Motorcycle man riding
his own motorcycle off a cliff?

08:51.265 --> 08:52.897
We'd be lucky to die
so poetically.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.833
- Did the two of you know
mr. Drummond?

08:54.968 --> 08:56.668
- Uh, only by reputation.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.570
- And quite the reputation
it was.

08:58.572 --> 09:01.105
We travelled all the way
from wisconsin just to meet
the feller.

09:02.276 --> 09:04.042
Anyhow, if you're not drummond,
then who are you?

09:04.111 --> 09:07.045
- Detective william murdoch,
toronto constabulary.

09:07.047 --> 09:07.979
And you?

09:08.048 --> 09:09.581
- Arthur davidson.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.315
- William s. Harley.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.085
- Mr. Davidson.
Mr. Harley.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.590
Harley-davidson.

09:18.592 --> 09:22.127
"the silent gray fellow,"
fellows.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.228
- That's right! The quietest
bike on the road.

09:24.298 --> 09:25.263
(murdoch): "bike."

09:26.500 --> 09:29.334
Oh! That's an amusing way
to refer to a motorcycle.

09:29.469 --> 09:30.735
(chuckles)
bike.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.003
- Sure thing.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.406
Anyhow,
dead old drummond here

09:34.541 --> 09:37.809
Supposedly was running his
falcon up to 75 miles per hour

09:37.944 --> 09:40.078
And we want to figure out
how in the heck he did it.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.279
- We can't seem
to crack 60 on our v-twin.

09:42.316 --> 09:44.949
- And anything bigger's
too expensive, or too bulky.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.552
So, where is it?

09:47.554 --> 09:49.421
We sure would like a gander.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.957
- I may be able to arrange that.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.160
(excited chuckles)

09:57.030 --> 10:00.197
(city hubbub)

10:01.201 --> 10:03.200
(♪)

10:04.771 --> 10:07.973
- Oh! Why, it's beautiful.
- It's a mess.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.175
- I need your help.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.779
I need to determine exactly
what happened

10:14.914 --> 10:17.648
When mr. Drummond and the falcon
went off of that cliff.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.117
- What do you need from us?

10:20.153 --> 10:22.520
- Well, I don't know
enough about

10:22.589 --> 10:25.523
A motorcycle's inner workings
to put it back together

10:25.592 --> 10:27.925
And discern what might have
transpired.

10:27.927 --> 10:30.528
- You need a... A doctor to do
an autopsy on the motorcycle?

10:31.064 --> 10:32.197
- Precisely.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.399
Now, my first suspicion,
of course, is the brakes,

10:34.468 --> 10:36.534
But whether they failed
outright,

10:36.536 --> 10:38.069
Or were tampered with...

10:38.071 --> 10:40.672
- How dastardly.
- Say no more, detective.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.473
We're the men for the job.

10:47.948 --> 10:51.816
- Henry! I need you
to sort through these papers.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.184
- What are they?

10:53.887 --> 10:56.154
- Well, some, presumably,

10:56.289 --> 11:01.292
Are... Are plans and designs for
a motorcycle called the falcon.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.695
And the others are, well,

11:03.697 --> 11:06.097
Meaningless scribblings
and doodles.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.166
- So you want me to look
for the designs?

11:08.301 --> 11:11.702
- Yes. I need you to sort them
into piles:

11:11.738 --> 11:14.038
Pertinent and non-pertinent.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.975
Ah, pertinent being any,
uh, schematics

11:16.977 --> 11:20.378
And... And motorcycle-related
drawings and such.

11:20.380 --> 11:23.314
And non-pertinent,
everything else.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.749
- All right.

11:24.884 --> 11:27.452
Oh! Sir, I got a postcard
from george.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.720
They're in london.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.656
- Oh! He must be enjoying
that tremendously, as is effie.

11:32.726 --> 11:33.992
Does he say where
they're off to next?

11:34.127 --> 11:35.260
- Uh...

11:36.229 --> 11:37.929
Oh! They're going
to 'broo-gess.'

11:38.064 --> 11:39.230
- What?

11:40.701 --> 11:42.567
- Bruges.
- Bruges.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.201
- What's bruges?
- Bloody hell, higgins!

11:44.237 --> 11:45.637
For once in your life
look at a map.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.605
It's in--
- belgium.

11:47.641 --> 11:49.541
- You don't pay me enough
to travel, sir.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.342
- You're not missing much.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.877
I wouldn't be seen dead
in bloody belgium.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.879
Murdoch, my office.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.047
- Sir.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.686
- Murdoch, this is mr--
- van der wyck.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.455
Reginald van der wyck.

12:05.625 --> 12:06.290
I'm here about the death of
ellsworth drummond.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.559
I came as soon as I heard.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.227
- What did you hear?

12:10.497 --> 12:11.429
- Well, I telephoned drummond
to see how he fared

12:11.498 --> 12:13.298
After his morning test run.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.300
His wife answered
and told me the dire news.

12:16.636 --> 12:19.036
- What's your interest?
- He's the dead man's partner.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.873
- Yes, I look after
the financials of our endeavour.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.710
As you can understand,
I'm beyond dismayed.

12:25.845 --> 12:28.179
I was set to make a mint
once the falcon was ready.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.514
- Is that so?

12:29.649 --> 12:31.315
- A mass production motorcycle
that can hit

12:31.351 --> 12:33.785
75 miles an hour
on a standard v-twin?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.987
Our competition
would have been ruined.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.522
Now I must start again.

12:37.524 --> 12:38.923
That's why I'm here.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.325
I understand you have
the designs

12:40.460 --> 12:41.726
And the falcon itself.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.529
- The motorcycle is
being examined as we speak.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.531
After all, it is evidence.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.032
- Why is it being considered
evidence?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.734
You don't suspect foul play,
do you?

12:49.869 --> 12:53.071
- Experts are examining
the machine presently

12:53.073 --> 12:54.806
To determine just that.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.674
- Experts? What experts?

12:57.611 --> 13:00.911
- A mr. Davidson and
a mr. Harley.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.680
Uh, motorcycle builders.
- Motorcycle builders? No, no.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.415
You must put a stop to this
at once.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.484
- Our investigation requires--

13:06.486 --> 13:08.586
- Your investigation does not
encompass rival engineers

13:08.588 --> 13:10.120
Examining patented designs.

13:11.257 --> 13:12.590
I will have my property returned
to me forthwith,

13:12.626 --> 13:14.758
Or I will see to it that my
lawyers sue this station house--

13:14.795 --> 13:16.760
- Mr. Van der wyck, have a seat!

13:17.964 --> 13:20.097
We will ensure that only
members of my station house

13:20.167 --> 13:22.800
Are looking at your motorcycle.
Isn't that right, murdoch?

13:23.770 --> 13:25.103
- Yes, sir.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.303
- Thank you.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.108
You don't have any scotch,
do you?

13:31.178 --> 13:32.743
- Excellent idea.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.550
- Gentlemen, I'm afraid--

13:39.586 --> 13:40.918
- Ah, detective, there you are.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.854
Now, look here, the brakes.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.488
Not a thing wrong with them.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.525
Except they've been
smashed to pieces along
with everything else.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.994
- No sign of tampering?
- Not at all.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.196
- But there is something else.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.666
The accelerator.
It's a simple design,

13:54.801 --> 13:57.201
But there's a... A rather
ingenious little latch

13:57.270 --> 13:59.137
Freshly welded on here.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.338
- What does it do?

14:00.407 --> 14:01.939
- Well, so far as I can tell,

14:01.975 --> 14:04.609
If the throttle were to reach
a certain point, it would catch,

14:04.611 --> 14:07.946
Bypassing the braking system
and... And locking
the accelerator.

14:09.415 --> 14:11.749
- Locking the accelerator
wide open.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.351
- That's right.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.287
- So the rider would not be able
to slow down at all?

14:16.422 --> 14:19.157
- It would keep him riding
at full speed, until, uh...

14:19.292 --> 14:21.726
- Until he went flying over
a dang cliff.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.160
<i> Mamma mia.</i>

14:23.997 --> 14:25.229
- We...

14:25.298 --> 14:27.698
This latch,
is it something simple?

14:27.734 --> 14:29.767
- Well, the... The latch itself
is simple,

14:29.903 --> 14:31.636
But to install
something like this

14:31.638 --> 14:33.438
Would require an intimate
knowledge of, uh,

14:33.573 --> 14:35.105
Motorcycle mechanics.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.241
- Hm.
- So whoever did this

14:37.244 --> 14:39.209
Knew a lot about motorcycles.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.712
Thank you, gentlemen.
- Mm-hmm.

14:41.781 --> 14:44.849
- Oh! Gentlemen,
I'm afraid I must ask you

14:44.984 --> 14:47.118
To stop inspecting the falcon
at once.

14:48.488 --> 14:49.720
- Wh--

14:53.960 --> 14:56.394
(city hubbub)

14:57.797 --> 14:59.597
(brackenreid): You think whoever
meddled with the accelerator

14:59.666 --> 15:00.865
Is one of this lot.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.867
(murdoch): Whoever it was
had a detailed knowledge

15:02.936 --> 15:04.936
Of motorcycle mechanisms.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.437
From what I understand,

15:06.572 --> 15:08.406
That's a very small community
here in toronto.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.141
I still can't believe
he didn't so much as swerve.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.478
- Maybe he was going so fast
he lost control?

15:14.547 --> 15:15.746
(julia): And do you two
ride together?

15:15.782 --> 15:17.147
- Julia?

15:17.183 --> 15:19.750
- William!
What are you doing here?

15:19.786 --> 15:21.185
- Well, we're...

15:21.855 --> 15:23.153
What are you doing here?

15:23.189 --> 15:26.023
Oh! Well, I'm considering buying
a motorcycle.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.494
- Are you sure that's wise?

15:29.496 --> 15:31.829
- Oh, william, come on.
It's just a bit of fun.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.032
Did you know
that mr. Coulter here

15:34.034 --> 15:35.633
Is the fastest man in canada?

15:35.702 --> 15:37.234
- Is that so?

15:37.270 --> 15:39.770
- I happen to hold
the current record, yes.

15:39.806 --> 15:42.173
- Ah, the falcon smashed
your record

15:42.242 --> 15:43.507
In its first test run.

15:43.543 --> 15:44.575
- Unofficial!

15:44.711 --> 15:45.943
- Not for long.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.578
(coulter): No one even saw
that test run!

15:47.614 --> 15:49.013
- It's only
a matter of time until

15:49.149 --> 15:50.782
You're completely forgotten,
coulter.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.516
- Oi! Sit down, jock.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.186
- Mr. Coulter, is it?

15:57.490 --> 16:01.926
Am I to understand that had
the falcon not met its end,

16:02.061 --> 16:04.862
You might have lost
your national speed record?

16:05.966 --> 16:08.065
- We'll never know.
- 'course he would have.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.002
- Mr. Coulter, would you please
remove your glove?

16:11.004 --> 16:12.470
- What's going on, william?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.806
- Someone broke into
mr. Drummond's garage

16:14.808 --> 16:17.942
And they cut themselves
on some broken glass.

16:17.944 --> 16:21.212
That someone likely
sabotaged the motorcycle,

16:21.214 --> 16:22.547
Which led to his death.

16:22.682 --> 16:23.647
- Sabotage?

16:24.784 --> 16:26.517
You can't think I had anything
to do with...

16:26.519 --> 16:27.885
- Please remove your glove.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.160
- You're coming with us,
sunshine.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.233
- I'll see you at dinner.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.234
- Yes.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.970
(♪)

16:53.112 --> 16:55.212
- I broke in, yes.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.449
I cut my hand, yes.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.683
But I didn't kill him.

17:00.754 --> 17:01.919
- He was going to break
your speed record.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.254
- Supposedly.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.323
- That's why you broke in;
to sabotage the falcon.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.660
- I put sand in his gas tank,
yes.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.129
- What? Why?

17:11.264 --> 17:12.963
- To clog the intake.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.932
You wouldn't even be able
to start the thing.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.335
- You wanted to sabotage
the prototype

17:17.337 --> 17:19.070
To preserve your speed record.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.471
- I'm not proud of it.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.074
I don't have a wife.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.208
I don't have kids.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.477
I don't even have a job.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.546
But I am the fastest man
in canada.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.613
That's what I am!

17:30.450 --> 17:31.882
- You're making our case for us.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.552
- So, why didn't it work?

17:34.554 --> 17:36.487
Putting sand in the tank.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.823
By all accounts, the motorcycle
was running in top form

17:38.958 --> 17:40.291
Prior to the accident.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.427
- Well, he must have heard me
break the glass.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.097
I heard him coming towards
the workshop and ran off.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.232
I imagine he flushed
the engine.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.802
- Or...

17:51.838 --> 17:54.972
Putting sand in the tank
wasn't the only thing you did
to the falcon.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.041
- Meaning what?

17:57.043 --> 18:00.244
- Meaning you could also
have installed the latch
on the accelerator,

18:00.246 --> 18:02.246
Which would have been
just as effective

18:02.248 --> 18:03.915
In ending
his demonstration run.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.449
- Well, I suppose I could have!

18:05.485 --> 18:07.084
But I didn't!

18:07.219 --> 18:09.820
I would go to great lengths
to keep my record,

18:09.823 --> 18:11.455
But I wouldn't kill a man.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.425
(♪)

18:16.395 --> 18:17.462
(brackenreid):
Do you believe him?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.397
- Not particularly. But
until we have more evidence,

18:19.532 --> 18:20.731
It's impossible to...

18:21.400 --> 18:22.400
Gentlemen?

18:22.535 --> 18:23.901
(brackenreid): Who are you two?

18:25.371 --> 18:27.872
- Oh! Uh, william s. Harley and
arthur davidson, sir.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.540
Motorcycle builders.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.342
- And what are you doing
in my station house?

18:32.679 --> 18:34.678
- Sir, these are the two young
men who helped to identify

18:34.714 --> 18:36.847
What had been done
to the falcon's accelerator.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.284
They appear to be going through
mr. Drummond's papers.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.220
- Uh, we just wanted
to have a look.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.820
- You can't blame us
for trying.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.890
- When it comes to motorcycles,
we really are bad boys,

18:45.892 --> 18:48.492
Detective.
- Wild ones, they call us.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.928
- Well, now you've had
a good shufti, off you trot.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.462
- Yeah.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.500
- Higgins, what are you
doing leaving these papers
lying around?

18:56.536 --> 18:58.502
- The detective told me
to sort through them.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.037
- And this is your sorting,
is it?

19:00.073 --> 19:01.005
- Uh, yes. I'm finished.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.773
Uh, you're the one
who told me to get a map.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.376
(murdoch): Henry!

19:07.313 --> 19:09.780
You've sorted this
into three piles.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.983
- Yes, sir. Pertinent,
non-pertinent

19:11.985 --> 19:13.750
And very non-pertinent.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.853
- What's very non-pertinent?

19:15.988 --> 19:18.622
- Duplicates. There's a dozen
copies of the same letter, sir.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.191
- What's in the letter?
- I don't know.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.461
I was looking for designs
and schematics, not reading.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.528
- Oh.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.930
Oh! This is very good, henry!

19:26.966 --> 19:27.864
- Oh!

19:31.337 --> 19:33.904
(♪)

19:39.879 --> 19:41.679
- It's a letter from a lawyer

19:42.849 --> 19:44.948
Accusing your husband
of stealing the designs

19:44.984 --> 19:48.118
Of the falcon from
another motorcycle manufacturer.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.955
- Well, that's ridiculous.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.423
What manufacturer?

19:53.793 --> 19:56.093
- The attorney does not disclose
the identity of his client.

19:56.162 --> 20:00.297
However, he does demand
that your husband cease all work

20:00.366 --> 20:02.432
On the falcon
effective immediately.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.169
- This is the first
I've heard of it.

20:05.304 --> 20:07.904
You should speak to his partner,
mr. Van der wyck.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.841
- Yes, I've seen it.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.042
It's poppycock.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.380
- You claim the designs
for the falcon were original?

20:16.515 --> 20:17.581
- Of course.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.383
Drummond spent years
building that machine.

20:19.518 --> 20:20.450
It's an incredible achievement.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.453
It was set to revolutionize
the market.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.989
Whoever's behind this
is simply jealous and afraid.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.391
- So, you were aware of
the allegations.

20:27.427 --> 20:30.127
- Yes. I responded to
the first letter.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.796
- What was your response?

20:31.931 --> 20:32.930
- Poppycock.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.732
All subsequent letters
were ignored.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.600
It was harassment,
plain and simple.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.368
- Harassment by whom?

20:39.138 --> 20:40.203
- By esterhalt, of course.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.405
- Who?

20:41.407 --> 20:43.274
- Bertram esterhalt.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.076
Drummond's partner
from years ago.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.677
Drummond strived for perfection,

20:46.812 --> 20:48.612
But esterhalt
liked to cut corners.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.281
The two of them
had a falling out.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.749
He was left behind.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.483
- I never sent no letter.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.954
(murdoch): Then who did?
- How should I know?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.691
- Where were you
at 9:00 a.M. This morning?

21:00.727 --> 21:02.159
- At home sleeping.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.894
- Can anyone confirm this?

21:03.963 --> 21:06.497
- I'm a bachelor.
What's all this about, anyway?

21:06.566 --> 21:09.032
The fool rode himself
off a cliff, didn't he?

21:10.103 --> 21:11.902
- We have reason to believe
someone tampered

21:11.938 --> 21:13.437
With his motorcycle.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.773
Whoever it was
had detailed knowledge

21:15.842 --> 21:17.174
Of its inner workings.

21:17.176 --> 21:19.844
- I haven't touched
a motorcycle in two years.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.912
Hadn't heard from drummond
in that time, either,

21:21.981 --> 21:23.013
'til last night.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.716
- You spoke to him last night?

21:25.851 --> 21:29.252
- He phoned me to crow
about the falcon being ready.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.322
You know,
his dream was made real.

21:31.324 --> 21:34.125
He even invited me to come see
the demonstration run.

21:35.261 --> 21:36.927
I never should've had that
telephone put in.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.462
It is nothing but a nuisance.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.132
- Did you attend
the demonstration?

21:41.267 --> 21:42.933
- No!

21:42.969 --> 21:45.469
Old ellie just wanted
to shove it in my face.

21:45.505 --> 21:48.138
All I wanted was
to never see the man again.

21:49.175 --> 21:50.408
- Seems you may have gotten
your wish.

21:51.210 --> 21:53.009
(♪)

21:53.813 --> 21:54.678
Esterhalt seems convincing.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.481
But who better to sabotage
a motorcycle

21:57.616 --> 22:00.350
Than the man who claims
to have designed it himself?

22:00.386 --> 22:02.620
- And if he didn't write
that letter, then who did?

22:02.622 --> 22:03.821
- Precisely.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.557
- So, william, ah...

22:07.493 --> 22:08.959
I've decided
to buy a motorcycle.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.430
- Julia, are you quite sure?

22:12.432 --> 22:13.631
- Of course.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.332
- We...

22:15.368 --> 22:18.369
You'll have to be
so careful!

22:18.504 --> 22:20.504
Macadam is terribly
unforgiving.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.239
And if you were to fall...

22:22.275 --> 22:26.110
I... If one were to fall and
hit one's head.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.712
People really should consider
protecting themselves.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.113
Perhaps a helmet?

22:31.450 --> 22:34.317
- William, one can injure
one's head falling off a horse,

22:34.354 --> 22:37.321
Or a bicycle! Imagine wearing
a helmet on a bicycle!

22:38.124 --> 22:39.724
- Well...
- Oh, william,

22:39.859 --> 22:41.859
These motorcycles don't even
go that fast.

22:41.994 --> 22:44.128
I mean, except
for this one, of course.

22:44.130 --> 22:47.398
- Yes. I still don't understand
how this v-twin

22:47.467 --> 22:49.933
Is capable of reaching
75 miles per hour.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.335
It's simple physics.

22:51.404 --> 22:54.605
The energy output is limited
by the size of the engine;

22:54.607 --> 22:57.207
It's only 54 cubic inches.

22:57.276 --> 22:59.744
- Perhaps it has something to do
with the fuel?

22:59.879 --> 23:02.346
- It's a gasoline engine.
The fuel can only...

23:03.816 --> 23:04.948
Unless...

23:04.984 --> 23:06.049
- Unless?

23:06.986 --> 23:09.620
- Unless the fuel was
adulterated.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.856
Julia, you are a genius!
Oh!

23:11.991 --> 23:13.457
- Am... Am I?

23:13.593 --> 23:15.659
- Yes! Yes.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.495
Uh, first, I'll have to...

23:18.564 --> 23:19.763
- Sir?

23:19.832 --> 23:21.998
Mrs. Hart is requesting you
in the morgue straight away.

23:23.536 --> 23:24.735
- Oh...

23:26.906 --> 23:29.173
- It was quite a mess
you left me with, detective.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.975
- Yes. I apologize
for the state of the corpse.

23:32.011 --> 23:34.178
- It certainly
kept things interesting.

23:34.247 --> 23:37.448
His clothing was the only thing
keeping parts of him intact.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.650
(sighs)
- what have you learned?

23:40.886 --> 23:42.286
- Well, there's nothing
to suggest cause of death

23:42.288 --> 23:43.787
Other than blunt force trauma.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.257
- Consistent with a fall
from a great height?

23:46.392 --> 23:47.258
- Indeed.

23:47.393 --> 23:49.660
Although evidence
of any other trauma

23:49.662 --> 23:51.662
Sustained before the fall
could have been obliterated.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.131
The skin ruptured in several
different places

23:54.133 --> 23:57.034
And many internal blood vessels
burst upon impact.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.736
- Making your job difficult,
I would imagine.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.205
- Beyond difficult.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.207
I attempted to gauge algor
mortis,

24:03.342 --> 24:06.544
But just as a steak and kidney
pie would cool faster

24:06.679 --> 24:07.945
Were you to puncture the crust,

24:08.014 --> 24:09.946
A compromised body
cools at a different rate

24:09.982 --> 24:10.748
Than an intact one.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.285
- Why are you trying
to establish algor mortis?

24:14.420 --> 24:15.986
We know when he died.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.689
- Well, that's the strange thing
about mr. Drummond here.

24:18.691 --> 24:21.491
As I worked on the body,
I realized rigor never set in.

24:22.528 --> 24:23.694
- Well, that is strange.

24:24.931 --> 24:26.497
- There was no time for it
to have come and gone

24:26.566 --> 24:28.098
Between him going over
the cliff

24:28.100 --> 24:29.600
And the time
that he arrived here.

24:29.735 --> 24:31.068
- Certainly not.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.170
And calcium levels
in the muscles

24:33.172 --> 24:35.038
Should not have been affected
by blood loss.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.340
- Shouldn't.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.642
I began to believe
something was amiss.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.445
So, I took a closer look
and I found something quite
interesting.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.115
(intriguing music)

24:46.652 --> 24:48.252
- Putrefaction.

24:48.387 --> 24:51.088
- Two spots,
at less than six hours.

24:52.458 --> 24:55.125
My estimate is this man
died between eight and 12 hours

24:55.127 --> 24:56.860
Earlier than we thought.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.564
- So, he was dead
before he went off the cliff.

25:01.066 --> 25:03.934
(♪)

25:07.073 --> 25:09.139
- So, someone
killed drummond earlier

25:09.275 --> 25:11.275
And dropped his body
at the bottom of the cliff.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.811
- Yes, sir. Meaning whoever
was riding that motorcycle

25:13.946 --> 25:15.412
Was not mr. Drummond.

25:15.448 --> 25:16.747
- Then it was the killer.

25:16.749 --> 25:17.815
- It seems likely.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.684
But the majority of our suspects
were all there.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.420
They saw the falcon being
ridden out of the garage

25:23.422 --> 25:25.221
And, eventually, off the cliff.

25:25.258 --> 25:27.458
- So, the bike went over,
but the killer didn't.

25:27.460 --> 25:30.561
He must have installed
the latch on the accelerator

25:30.696 --> 25:33.096
So that the motorcycle's
throttle would remain engaged

25:33.165 --> 25:35.632
And allow him to simply
send it off.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.434
- And no rider at all?

25:37.436 --> 25:40.670
- And, whoever it was, did not
want us to find that latch.

25:41.807 --> 25:44.774
- So, they killed drummond
and then set this up

25:44.810 --> 25:46.310
To make it look like
it was an accident.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.578
- Indeed.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.980
So, the culprit could not
have been any of the members

25:50.115 --> 25:51.047
Of the motorcycle club.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.249
- They were all there
and accounted for.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.450
- Precisely.

25:54.620 --> 25:57.121
Although, whoever was riding
that motorcycle

25:57.123 --> 25:59.456
Could have conspired
with one of them.

25:59.525 --> 26:01.225
- What makes you think that?

26:01.360 --> 26:04.862
- Well, sir, if drummond
was killed the night before,

26:05.932 --> 26:08.431
How could his wife have been
unaware?

26:09.201 --> 26:10.667
- Let's speak to the widow.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.904
- Someone killed him
hours before?

26:13.906 --> 26:14.738
- That's right.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.740
And you would have known
about it.

26:16.875 --> 26:19.542
- No! I have no idea
what you're talking about.

26:19.579 --> 26:22.880
- He's your husband!
You didn't see him that morning?

26:23.015 --> 26:25.149
- No! He was in his workshop.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.018
- Surely you saw him
the night before?

26:28.153 --> 26:31.622
- He spent all night in there
preparing for the demonstration.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.023
I swear it.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.427
He did it all the time,
working through the night.

26:36.429 --> 26:38.362
I never questioned it.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.897
The night before
his big test run...

26:41.433 --> 26:43.299
It never even occurred
to me that...

26:48.274 --> 26:51.508
- Mrs. Drummond,
you must admit that this story

26:51.644 --> 26:53.476
Is difficult to believe.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.580
- Story? What story?

26:56.715 --> 26:59.249
You're the ones telling me
something that's absolutely mad!

26:59.251 --> 27:00.617
- You're lying.

27:00.620 --> 27:01.619
- I'm not!

27:03.122 --> 27:05.188
- You didn't even recognize your
own husband on that motorcycle?

27:05.224 --> 27:08.191
- I... I don't know!
I thought it was him!

27:08.227 --> 27:10.193
I don't understand
any of this!

27:10.796 --> 27:12.329
(panting)

27:14.199 --> 27:16.533
- When did you last see
your husband alive?

27:16.602 --> 27:17.868
- I...

27:19.939 --> 27:21.271
Supper...

27:22.508 --> 27:23.674
I think.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.410
Yes, early that evening.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.680
After that he went
to his workshop,

27:29.682 --> 27:31.381
And I didn't see him until
the next morning.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.617
Or, rather,

27:34.687 --> 27:37.053
I suppose I never saw him again.

27:39.091 --> 27:42.859
Whatever happened,
I had nothing to do with it.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.228
You have to believe me.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.100
(brackenreid): I don't believe
a word she says.

27:50.235 --> 27:53.970
- Sir, she was among
the spectators just prior
to the incident.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.173
She could not have been
the rider on that motorcycle.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.007
- She was in on it
with someone else.

27:59.845 --> 28:03.313
- Well, sir, there is
one suspect who wasn't there:

28:03.449 --> 28:04.848
The former partner.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.182
- Could be him.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.786
- Henry!

28:08.921 --> 28:10.587
- Uh! Yes?

28:10.656 --> 28:12.823
- Contact the lawyer
who wrote those letters

28:12.825 --> 28:14.791
And demand he reveal
who his client is.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.795
If it's mr. Esterhalt,
then we know he was lying

28:17.797 --> 28:20.063
About his relationship
with mr. Drummond and, likely,

28:20.132 --> 28:22.332
Lying about his whereabouts
that morning as well.

28:22.334 --> 28:23.566
- Sirs.

28:25.637 --> 28:28.338
- Is that something you want to
leave to the likes of higgins?

28:28.407 --> 28:30.741
Leaning on a lawyer can be
a delicate proposition.

28:31.577 --> 28:32.942
- I'm sure he can handle it.

28:32.978 --> 28:34.444
Also, sir,

28:34.447 --> 28:36.413
I believe I know
how the falcon was able

28:36.415 --> 28:40.150
To reach 75 miles per hour
and I intend to replicate it.

28:40.186 --> 28:43.686
You see, the only limitation
is the volume,

28:43.723 --> 28:45.222
Or displacement, of an engine.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.491
I intend to make the eng--
- murdoch!

28:48.360 --> 28:49.626
You've lost me already.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.430
(♪)

28:56.502 --> 28:58.435
(julia): William,
here's your nitrous oxide.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.171
- Oh, good!
- Why on earth do you need
laughing gas?

29:01.306 --> 29:03.107
- It's quite fascinating,
actually.

29:03.242 --> 29:07.244
I realized that the speed
at which fuel gets consumed--

29:07.246 --> 29:09.046
- I'm sure it's fascinating,

29:09.048 --> 29:11.248
But I have to get back
to the clinic.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.116
Don't have too much fun
without me.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.318
- I make no promises.

29:15.421 --> 29:18.788
(door opens and closes)

29:22.494 --> 29:23.794
No!

29:25.097 --> 29:27.197
- Sir, I found out from
the lawyer who his client is.

29:27.199 --> 29:29.666
- I already know, henry.
It was harley and davidson.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.436
- Huh. Well, why'd I have to do
all that work then?

29:36.442 --> 29:38.275
(murdoch): As I was examining
the falcon,

29:38.344 --> 29:40.477
I came across something
very interesting.

29:41.880 --> 29:46.349
Along the fuel intake line,
I found a maker's mark: Hd.

29:46.385 --> 29:47.884
Harley-davidson.

29:48.754 --> 29:50.153
- And what are you saying?

29:50.222 --> 29:53.423
- It's one of your parts!
In fact,

29:53.492 --> 29:56.426
The falcon is an amalgam
of many of your parts.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.294
And you knew that.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.031
That's why you had your lawyer
send all of those letters.

30:01.100 --> 30:04.835
The drummond revolutionary
motorcycle

30:04.970 --> 30:07.237
Is nothing but a reconfigured
harley.

30:07.273 --> 30:10.040
- It... It is not a harley,
it is a harley-davidson!

30:10.109 --> 30:11.508
- Oh, that's what the man meant!

30:11.643 --> 30:13.109
- Should have been
davidson harley.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.645
Then people would be
shortening it to davidson!

30:14.780 --> 30:16.647
- That's a mouthful.
- A davie then!

30:16.782 --> 30:18.182
(murdoch): Gentlemen!

30:18.317 --> 30:19.716
The point is

30:19.785 --> 30:22.585
He was stealing from you,
and you knew it.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.455
- Yes, it's true.

30:25.524 --> 30:28.058
We saw a photograph of the thing
in<i> popular mechanics.</i>

30:28.060 --> 30:29.660
We could hardly believe
our eyes.

30:29.795 --> 30:33.197
- He was using your parts
to make a faster motorcycle.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.065
He was going to win
all of your customers.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.634
- Oh, supposedly.

30:38.704 --> 30:39.870
We still can't figure out
how he did it.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.404
The engine is the same.

30:42.575 --> 30:44.274
There may have been a minor
cosmetic adjustment,

30:44.310 --> 30:46.543
But, inside, it's quite
literally our v-twin.

30:46.678 --> 30:50.280
- Even after getting a look
at the thing, it makes no sense.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.282
- I disagree.

30:52.318 --> 30:56.319
It is possible for the same
engine to make more power

30:57.356 --> 30:59.055
By altering the fuel.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.592
- To what? The engine runs
on gasoline.

31:03.429 --> 31:06.230
- Yes.
But, with an additive,

31:07.432 --> 31:11.067
The same engine can burn
the same fuel faster.

31:12.004 --> 31:15.572
- I... I...
I suppose, in theory.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.440
- Nitrous oxide.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.977
It forces more oxygen
into the fuel.

31:21.013 --> 31:25.248
The result is a motorcycle that
runs on highly oxygenated gas.

31:25.251 --> 31:27.183
I call it hog for short.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.518
- Hog.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.320
Now that's a good name
for a bike.

31:30.389 --> 31:33.523
- A "hog" would run faster

31:33.559 --> 31:36.326
While using
the same component parts.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.063
- Yes, but the... The fuel would
burn in the blink of an eye.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.665
Who is going
to buy a motorcycle

31:41.734 --> 31:43.200
When its gas is gone
in 60 seconds?

31:43.335 --> 31:45.201
(harley): Not to mention
the noise.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.603
The harley-davidson brand
is synonymous

31:47.640 --> 31:49.005
With the silent grey fellow.

31:49.074 --> 31:52.476
- We want everyone's grandma
riding davies, detective.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.944
- Oh, give it up, artie.
- And, anyway,

31:54.980 --> 31:57.447
All that fuel igniting at once?
You'd be blown to kingdom come!

31:58.617 --> 32:00.684
- We... Yes.

32:00.819 --> 32:03.887
But at the time that
the falcon was sabotaged,

32:03.889 --> 32:05.689
And mr. Drummond was killed,

32:05.758 --> 32:08.891
All you knew was that
he had taken your parts

32:08.928 --> 32:10.560
And was about to outdo you.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.029
That's motive for murder.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.630
- We didn't--
- I checked with your hotel.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.634
You arrived in toronto
the day before

32:17.769 --> 32:19.736
I met you
in drummond's workshop.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.772
If you had traveled
all this way to meet the man,

32:22.808 --> 32:26.309
Why wait hours before
making your first visit?

32:29.381 --> 32:31.114
(sighs)
- all right, we... We...

32:32.250 --> 32:34.184
We did go there the day before.
- Artie!

32:34.186 --> 32:36.119
- What? We didn't do
anything wrong.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.987
- Look,
drummond wasn't even there.

32:39.191 --> 32:40.390
- Maybe he was.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.592
And maybe you're lying.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.796
Perhaps you met up with him,
confronted him,

32:46.865 --> 32:49.733
Argued and one or
both of you killed him.

32:49.735 --> 32:53.136
- We didn't!
- We... We didn't come to
confront him.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.604
We already had an arrangement.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.740
- What kind of arrangement?

32:56.742 --> 32:59.842
- To buy the device that
was making his bike go so fast.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.479
- He was going to sell it
to you?

33:02.548 --> 33:05.148
- Not him. His partner.
- Mr. Van der wyck.

33:05.283 --> 33:06.983
He said he was tired
of the production delays

33:06.986 --> 33:08.684
And he wanted to recoup
on his investments.

33:08.721 --> 33:11.087
We can show you
the correspondence that
proves it.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.889
- He wanted to sell us
the device, the designs,

33:12.925 --> 33:14.291
The whole shebang.

33:17.963 --> 33:20.430
- If harley and davidson
are to be believed,

33:20.565 --> 33:22.766
Drummond's partner was about
to sell the business

33:22.768 --> 33:24.100
Out from under him.

33:24.136 --> 33:26.236
- This van der wyck was
in buffalo when the murder
happened.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.304
- So he says.
He's just at the hotel.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.773
- Well, if he's lying
about that,

33:29.775 --> 33:31.041
He could be the man on
the motorcycle.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.442
He sent the thing over
the edge

33:32.577 --> 33:34.111
And then flung drummond
over after it.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.379
- Or perhaps threw drummond's
body over the cliff

33:36.415 --> 33:38.048
Ahead of time.
There he is, sir.

33:40.419 --> 33:41.651
- Look who he's with.

33:42.454 --> 33:43.786
(murdoch): Deedee drummond.

33:47.393 --> 33:48.925
- They're in it together.

33:49.428 --> 33:50.994
(♪)

33:56.135 --> 33:57.934
(brackenreid): You were having
an affair.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.937
Your husband was obsessed
with his motorcycle.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.172
He was ignoring his marriage.

34:04.309 --> 34:07.010
- Yes, that part's true.

34:07.012 --> 34:08.879
- The falcon was a bust.

34:09.014 --> 34:11.615
It was built with another
company's parts

34:11.750 --> 34:14.684
And unless you sold
whatever technology

34:14.753 --> 34:18.154
Mr. Drummond had already
developed prior to going
to market,

34:18.190 --> 34:20.557
You would have been sued
out of existence.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.492
- Yes, that's true as well.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.894
I had to do it.

34:24.029 --> 34:26.229
- But when you told drummond,
he refused.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.265
- Is that what happened
the night he died?

34:28.400 --> 34:30.700
An argument that got
out of hand?

34:30.736 --> 34:33.302
- Dear god, no.
I never told him.

34:33.338 --> 34:35.572
I swear.
- You've got it all wrong.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.909
- We were having an affair,
obviously.

34:39.044 --> 34:40.844
But that impropriety
is the reason

34:40.913 --> 34:43.046
For any mistruths
we may have spoken.

34:43.048 --> 34:46.182
- Mistruths? You lied.
You killed him.

34:46.218 --> 34:48.285
- No! You don't understand.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.619
- We didn't kill him.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.187
- You killed him
and you covered it up.

34:51.223 --> 34:54.057
- You got all of your friends
together who knew about
the falcon,

34:54.192 --> 34:57.393
But what you were really doing
was staging an accident

34:57.463 --> 34:59.996
In order to cover up
the real cause of death.

34:59.998 --> 35:02.732
- You dressed up like him,
got on his motorcycle

35:02.734 --> 35:04.134
And sent it sailing over
the cliff.

35:04.269 --> 35:08.204
- Where, presumably,
mr. Drummond's body had
already been thrown.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.006
- How could you do that
to your own husband?

35:10.142 --> 35:11.341
- I didn't!

35:11.410 --> 35:13.209
- What you propose is simply
not possible.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.278
Deedee was there
when it happened,

35:15.280 --> 35:17.814
There's no question,
so she couldn't have done it.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.417
- She wasn't the one
on the motorcycle.

35:20.552 --> 35:22.652
You were.
- Wasn't me, either.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.488
I was in buffalo
until I heard the news.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.623
- Why should we believe you?
- Believe me?

35:26.625 --> 35:29.025
I'm telling you.
I still have the ticket.

35:32.131 --> 35:33.095
Surely I...

35:33.699 --> 35:34.697
Blast...

35:35.467 --> 35:36.532
- Mr. Van der wyck!

35:37.135 --> 35:38.968
- Ah! Here it is.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.803
See?

35:41.573 --> 35:45.041
(♪)

35:46.478 --> 35:48.244
- Timed, dated and punched.

35:48.280 --> 35:51.081
I checked with union station and
the 10:40 got in on time.

35:51.083 --> 35:52.616
- Could he have posed
as drummond

35:52.751 --> 35:54.451
And gotten to buffalo in time
to get on that train?

35:54.453 --> 35:56.452
- There's no express service
on a Saturday morning, sir.

35:56.454 --> 35:58.255
- Maybe he drove?

35:58.257 --> 36:00.657
- To make up that distance,
without stopping,

36:00.726 --> 36:02.726
Even if the roads were paved
right through,

36:02.861 --> 36:04.961
Would be impossible.
- What if he rode?

36:06.398 --> 36:08.598
- A horse isn't capable
of reaching anywhere near
that speed.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.466
- I meant a bike, murdoch.
A motorcycle.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.869
- They're not fast enough,
either.

36:12.938 --> 36:15.138
He would have to have been
riding the falcon.

36:15.273 --> 36:18.074
And it was in pieces at
the bottom of a cliff by then.

36:18.143 --> 36:20.143
- Well, those two are guilty
as sin.

36:20.212 --> 36:22.212
(murdoch): Sir,
it's just not possible.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.680
- I'm sure of it!

36:23.749 --> 36:25.682
If those two weren't on
the motorcycle,

36:25.684 --> 36:28.018
Then someone else was.
The only question is

36:28.020 --> 36:29.552
Who was in on it with them.

36:30.255 --> 36:31.521
- A third conspirator?

36:31.656 --> 36:34.624
- There is one suspect
without an alibi.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.893
And we know he's lied to us.

36:36.962 --> 36:40.062
You have stated that you were
home the morning

36:40.098 --> 36:42.298
That mr. Drummond
was found dead.

36:42.334 --> 36:43.700
Can anyone attest to this?

36:43.702 --> 36:45.435
- Just myself.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.639
- You also claim that
mr. Drummond telephoned you

36:49.675 --> 36:51.775
The night before his test run.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.576
- I don't claim anything.

36:53.645 --> 36:56.179
He phoned, we spoke,
end of story.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.181
- What time was this?

36:58.250 --> 37:00.116
- Ah, late. Ten o'clock, maybe.

37:01.453 --> 37:04.387
- Unfortunately, mr. Esterhalt,
we know this to be a lie.

37:05.123 --> 37:06.522
- It is no such thing.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.924
- Mr. Drummond was dead
by 10:00 p.M.

37:08.961 --> 37:09.926
- Says who?

37:09.995 --> 37:12.262
- The coroner
for the city of toronto.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.797
- Well, he's wrong
and you're wrong.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.966
The man telephoned me
at ten o'clock.

37:17.002 --> 37:20.070
- Is it possible that someone
was posing as mr. Drummond?

37:20.205 --> 37:23.473
I've worked alongside ellsworth
drummond for four years

37:23.542 --> 37:25.275
And knew him for even longer.

37:25.410 --> 37:28.144
- Be that as it may,
it is possible that--

37:28.280 --> 37:30.213
- Imagine someone
telephoned you

37:30.348 --> 37:32.148
Pretending to be
your inspector.

37:32.217 --> 37:34.150
How long could
they keep that ruse up?

37:34.186 --> 37:38.488
Maybe five seconds?
I spoke to old ellie for
a good 10 minutes.

37:38.490 --> 37:40.490
It was him.
- Mr. Esterhalt,

37:40.559 --> 37:43.693
There is no point
in continuing with this lie.

37:43.729 --> 37:46.562
- It's not a damn lie!

37:49.101 --> 37:51.367
- Ah, sir, I noticed something
unusual.

37:51.403 --> 37:52.902
- Not now, henry.

37:52.904 --> 37:54.838
- I suppose you figured it out
on your own already.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.239
Honestly, why do I bother?

37:57.409 --> 37:59.842
- Figured what out?
- It doesn't matter, sir.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.411
- Henry.

38:01.546 --> 38:03.179
- Well, I thought there
was something not quite right

38:03.248 --> 38:05.114
About the ticket stub
you gave me.

38:05.150 --> 38:08.518
- Mr. Van der wyck's ticket?
- Yes. You see, this one is his.

38:08.520 --> 38:12.121
But I took the same train
with ruthie and jordan a week
ago and look.

38:16.228 --> 38:18.061
- Same ticket, different date.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.297
- The hole, sir.
They're different shapes.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.200
I suppose it's possible they
changed their ticket taking...

38:24.269 --> 38:25.735
Thing.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.605
- Or it's possible he purchased
the ticket in advance,

38:29.607 --> 38:32.875
Punched it himself
and was never on that train.

38:33.545 --> 38:34.678
- Did I...

38:35.880 --> 38:37.613
Did I just solve the case?

38:38.750 --> 38:40.116
- No.
- Oh.

38:40.118 --> 38:42.085
- It still doesn't explain
how mr. Esterhalt

38:42.087 --> 38:44.220
Spoke to mr. Drummond after
he was killed.

38:47.392 --> 38:49.625
Henry, have we released
mr. Van der wyck

38:49.695 --> 38:51.827
And mrs. Drummond?
- Yes, sir. Just a moment ago.

38:52.597 --> 38:53.630
- Mr. Esterhalt!

38:53.765 --> 38:54.698
We need to stop them.

38:55.767 --> 38:59.302
Sir, I need your help for
just a moment.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.472
- Mrs. Drummond!

39:04.876 --> 39:05.941
- Ellsworth?

39:06.845 --> 39:08.411
I thought you were dead.

39:08.547 --> 39:10.913
- William, what's going on?

39:10.949 --> 39:12.615
- This is ellsworth drummond.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.584
- The dead man? What on earth?

39:15.620 --> 39:19.055
- He faked his own death after
killing his business partner.

39:19.057 --> 39:20.423
- Let's go!

39:20.425 --> 39:21.758
(dramatic music)

39:21.893 --> 39:22.826
(julia): William!

39:25.297 --> 39:26.662
(grunting)

39:26.664 --> 39:27.731
Oh!

39:28.934 --> 39:29.799
- Woah!

39:35.340 --> 39:36.406
- Stop!

39:37.576 --> 39:38.808
Stop!

39:41.212 --> 39:44.514
- William, come on!
- Julia, what are you doing?

39:44.649 --> 39:45.982
- Going after them!

39:50.455 --> 39:52.788
(♪)

39:59.765 --> 40:02.565
(engine revving)

40:04.002 --> 40:05.001
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.636
- Oh, hey!
- What in the blazes?

40:06.771 --> 40:08.704
(engine revs loudly)

40:08.706 --> 40:11.307
- Oh! Ouch!
Good lord, that's loud.

40:11.376 --> 40:13.576
- I love it.
- Look at him go.

40:13.711 --> 40:14.978
He's a natural on a bike.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.247
- That detective murdoch
is one easy rider.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.986
(♪)

41:01.493 --> 41:03.493
(♪)

41:05.330 --> 41:06.929
- Stop! Stop!

41:10.101 --> 41:12.502
- Mr. And mrs. Drummond,
you are under arrest

41:12.571 --> 41:14.837
For the murder
of reginald van der wyck.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.105
(gasps)

41:18.843 --> 41:19.808
(sighs)

41:23.181 --> 41:27.050
Van der wyck wanted
to sell to harley and davidson.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.085
- You refused.
- Of course I did.

41:29.220 --> 41:30.786
The falcon's my life.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.322
- But you couldn't bring it
to market

41:33.358 --> 41:34.924
Because you were using
their designs.

41:34.960 --> 41:35.925
You would have been sued.

41:36.060 --> 41:38.294
- And you couldn't sell
the idea, either,

41:38.363 --> 41:40.196
Because you'd never
figured it out.

41:41.466 --> 41:42.665
- It's true.

41:44.035 --> 41:46.603
There's no device.
There's...

41:46.605 --> 41:48.504
No special fuel.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.473
- And if anyone had ever gotten
their hands on the falcon,

41:51.510 --> 41:53.809
They would've known straight
away that it couldn't reach

41:53.811 --> 41:56.445
Anywhere near
75 miles per hour.

41:57.282 --> 41:58.715
- You're nothing but a fraud.

42:00.352 --> 42:01.550
- How did you do it?

42:03.355 --> 42:05.154
How did you make it go so fast?

42:07.158 --> 42:08.825
- I had a need for speed.

42:13.164 --> 42:14.564
- You really did it.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.599
75 miles per hour!

42:16.734 --> 42:17.834
- Yes.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.302
But, as you two rightly
pointed out,

42:19.437 --> 42:21.971
Such a device is hardly fit
for the market.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.440
- No, but perhaps we'll install
these nitrous injectors

42:24.442 --> 42:25.775
On our own motorcycles.

42:25.777 --> 42:27.543
It certainly would make
a race more fun.

42:27.612 --> 42:29.211
- And... And that sound!

42:29.247 --> 42:30.779
How did you make it sound
like that?

42:30.815 --> 42:34.117
- This... Oh! Well,
I had to remove the muffler

42:34.119 --> 42:36.586
For the nitrous to work.
- Hm.

42:36.588 --> 42:40.056
I want harley-davidson machines
to sound exactly like that.

42:40.191 --> 42:43.526
- Are you mad?
- I'm afraid I have to agree.

42:43.528 --> 42:46.729
No one's going to buy
a motorcycle that sounds
like that.

42:48.466 --> 42:51.300
(♪)

42:59.277 --> 43:01.343
(julia): Well?
What do you think?

43:03.315 --> 43:04.647
- What's this?

43:05.917 --> 43:08.184
- Well, I realized that
leather is the most durable

43:08.186 --> 43:11.087
And effective material
to prevent injury

43:11.089 --> 43:13.355
If one had an accident
on the motorcycle.

43:14.192 --> 43:16.892
- Oh! Certainly is interesting.

43:16.928 --> 43:18.428
- Interesting?

43:19.431 --> 43:21.698
- Nice. It's--
- nice?!

43:21.833 --> 43:25.134
William! I look positively
devilish.

43:26.871 --> 43:29.571
- Oh, I don't know about
a devil.

43:30.174 --> 43:31.707
Angel, perhaps?

43:31.776 --> 43:33.042
(chuckles)

43:33.712 --> 43:35.310
One of hell's angels?

43:39.084 --> 43:40.382
(♪)

43:41.620 --> 43:44.987
(theme music)

44:07.679 --> 44:09.078
Subtitling: Difuze
