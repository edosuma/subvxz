WEBVTT

00:23.566 --> 00:26.273
Damn, it's colder in here
than it is outside.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.190
Not possible.

00:27.278 --> 00:28.859
Zhaan:
Greetings.

00:28.946 --> 00:32.188
We have been told we might
find a Luxan here.

00:32.283 --> 00:34.444
Hey, buddy, we're expected.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.366
Where you going?

00:36.454 --> 00:39.321
Zhaan:
I think we're being
asked to wait.

00:41.292 --> 00:44.159
Take a number, have a seat.

00:44.253 --> 00:47.416
No magazines. Typical.

00:48.883 --> 00:50.589
Familiar?

00:51.802 --> 00:54.714
I believe it is an Otec lamp.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.840
Is that a Luxan thing?

00:58.935 --> 01:01.301
It is used to ward off evil.

01:01.395 --> 01:05.559
Zhaan:
Then the rumors we heard on
the commerce planet must be true after all.

01:10.446 --> 01:12.232
Crichton:
Number 78.

01:13.491 --> 01:15.277
We're good to go.

01:15.368 --> 01:17.905
I'll take that as a "yes."

01:22.208 --> 01:24.620
Stop! There!

01:26.796 --> 01:29.253
How remarkable.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.127
It is a Luxan.

01:32.218 --> 01:36.461
Plus, a Delvian and some
species I can't identify.

01:36.555 --> 01:39.922
Human. You wouldn't know
about us yet.

01:40.017 --> 01:42.804
I don't care to.

01:42.895 --> 01:45.511
Only the Luxan interests me.

01:46.649 --> 01:49.231
Send him closer.

01:49.318 --> 01:52.185
What's the matter?
Are you hideous?

01:52.280 --> 01:54.441
Let me see you.

01:59.745 --> 02:02.077
Have you a name?

02:03.541 --> 02:06.283
I am Ka D'Argo.

02:07.295 --> 02:10.787
Rather young for a general.

02:11.382 --> 02:12.462
General?

02:12.550 --> 02:14.962
She must be losing
her eyesight.

02:15.052 --> 02:18.044
Yes, but not my hearing.

02:19.724 --> 02:21.806
General D'Argo,

02:23.060 --> 02:26.973
my name is Nilaam.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.806
Please forgive me. I did not
realize. We must leave.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.561
You will stay!

02:35.364 --> 02:37.571
You're an Orican.

02:37.658 --> 02:42.197
Does that justify you
collapsing in fear?

02:42.288 --> 02:44.449
Stop your groveling.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.371
Look at me.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.128
That's better.

02:57.428 --> 02:59.134
Come closer.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.481
Closer.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.571
As you must have noticed
by now,

03:22.661 --> 03:24.947
I'm dying.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.663
If you wish it, I will attend.

03:31.754 --> 03:35.338
Think you're worthy
of the honor?

03:40.262 --> 03:43.049
That judgment is yours to make.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.014
Exactly so.

03:46.644 --> 03:48.805
Let's find out.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.358
( crying out)

03:57.446 --> 03:59.858
D'Argo!
-No, stand back!

03:59.949 --> 04:03.237
Nilaam:
You are very strong.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.285
But worthy?

04:10.292 --> 04:11.247
No!

04:11.335 --> 04:13.166
Fraud!

04:13.254 --> 04:15.415
D'Argo!

04:21.137 --> 04:23.298
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

04:23.389 --> 04:26.552
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.304
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

04:29.395 --> 04:32.979
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

04:33.065 --> 04:33.815
Help me.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.355
Listen, please.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.274
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:37.361 --> 04:41.400
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.867
I'm doing everything I can.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.784
I'm just looking for
a way home.

05:04.805 --> 05:05.885
D'Argo:
I'm fine.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.133
How the hell can you be fine?

05:07.224 --> 05:08.885
She just shoved her hand
inside your chest.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.137
l'm unharmed.
-Then let me look.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.889
(grunting)

05:14.106 --> 05:15.607
As I told you.

05:15.691 --> 05:17.272
We'll leave now.

05:18.444 --> 05:20.105
That works for me.

05:20.196 --> 05:22.733
D'Argo, you don't want
toleave.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.814
Zhaan, word.

05:28.454 --> 05:30.319
D'Argo has been humiliated.

05:30.414 --> 05:32.405
Yeah, well, considering that
woman was grabbing his guts

05:32.500 --> 05:35.242
I'd say he got off lucky
with "humiliated."

05:35.336 --> 05:36.542
She does not mean to harm him.

05:36.629 --> 05:39.336
How do you know?
-Because she's an Orican.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.414
She's a holy woman revered
by all Luxans.

05:41.509 --> 05:44.171
Crichton:
And holy women never go bad.

05:44.261 --> 05:49.005
So why is she way out here
all by herself... alone?

05:49.099 --> 05:50.259
I don't know.

05:50.351 --> 05:51.841
Right. You don't know.

05:51.936 --> 05:54.143
She could have been
excommunicated.

05:54.230 --> 05:58.940
She could have been kicked out
for putting her hands in other
people's business!

05:59.026 --> 06:01.813
Her worthiness is not in
question. Mine is.

06:01.904 --> 06:06.318
D'Argo, just because some
ancient Luxan doesn't like the
feel of your spleen

06:06.408 --> 06:10.151
does not mean she has the right
to call my friend a fraud!

06:10.246 --> 06:12.783
She called me a fraud because
lam not a general.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.158
Well, who said that you were?

06:14.250 --> 06:15.911
Idid.

06:18.337 --> 06:22.000
These are the markings
of a general.

06:26.428 --> 06:30.171
Crichton:
Okay, so you, uh...

06:30.266 --> 06:32.678
you got the bar codes of a
general, but you aren't one.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.599
No.

06:36.021 --> 06:39.013
In my second campaign,
our enemies surrounded us.

06:39.108 --> 06:40.564
My general was badly wounded.

06:40.651 --> 06:44.314
I knew he wouldn't survive
interrogation if he
were captured,

06:44.405 --> 06:47.317
so I took on the tattoo of his
rank to protect him.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.990
Were you captured, D'Argo?

06:52.746 --> 06:55.829
Yes.

06:55.916 --> 07:00.580
But my battle unit was freed
before the enemy had a chance
to see through my ruse.

07:00.671 --> 07:03.583
But you saved the real
general's ass, right?

07:04.466 --> 07:06.548
Right?

07:06.635 --> 07:11.095
So, tell me, what the hell
is she bitching about?

07:11.181 --> 07:13.342
Zhaan:
I agree with Crichton.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.642
Your fraud served a higher
purpose, D'Argo.

07:16.729 --> 07:20.096
Certainly the Orican can
understand that.

07:20.190 --> 07:23.102
Crichton:
And if she doesn't...

07:23.193 --> 07:25.445
brother, that's her problem.

07:27.323 --> 07:29.234
You're right.

07:29.325 --> 07:30.861
Good.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.192
So let's get back to Moya and
heat up some Irish coffees.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.903
No, you're right that she
should understand that.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.659
Wait here.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.368
Damn!

07:42.171 --> 07:44.537
We were almost out of here.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.959
l have not sent for you.

07:50.054 --> 07:51.840
No.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.182
Yet you dare to intrude
upon me.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.803
Yes. | wish to say something.

07:56.894 --> 08:00.512
I could kill you where
you stand.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.517
I know you could.

08:02.608 --> 08:05.270
Nonetheless, I wish to
say something.

08:05.361 --> 08:06.521
( scoffs )

08:06.612 --> 08:10.104
And why would I wish
to hear it?

08:10.199 --> 08:12.986
Because it is the truth.

08:13.077 --> 08:15.363
l was taught that Oricans
are seekers of truth.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.365
Was I misinformed?

08:17.456 --> 08:20.448
You are no general.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.409
What more truth need I hear?

08:24.046 --> 08:26.253
An explanation.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.298
If you are not interested
in the full truth

08:29.385 --> 08:32.297
then you are not a true Orican.

08:32.388 --> 08:33.844
( chuckles )

08:34.640 --> 08:38.224
I knew you had strength.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.767
I needed to know...

08:40.854 --> 08:43.266
if you had fire.

08:48.487 --> 08:57.156
(Chiana singing)

08:59.248 --> 09:01.079
Here are some more.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.155
Some more what?

09:02.251 --> 09:03.161
Clothes to be cleaned.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.743
Oh, no problem.
Room for us both.

09:05.838 --> 09:08.045
No, I want you to wash these.

09:08.132 --> 09:09.463
Oh, do you?

09:09.550 --> 09:11.836
What, are you allergic to Moya's
amnexus fluids or something?

09:11.927 --> 09:13.463
Just wash them, will you?

09:13.554 --> 09:17.217
Um, when exactly did I
become your servant?

09:17.307 --> 09:18.888
Why do l have to wash
your clothes?

09:18.976 --> 09:21.012
Well, you're cleaning D'Argo's,
aren't you?

09:21.103 --> 09:23.845
Yeah, but I like D'Argo.

09:24.982 --> 09:30.227
Crichton:
She wants you to attend her.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.062
What exactly does that mean?

09:33.157 --> 09:35.239
D'Argo:
Whatever she wants it to mean.

09:35.325 --> 09:41.161
So, if she wants to rip out
your liver, snack on it with a
Chianti, she can do that?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.864
She wouldn't do that.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.245
Well, what is she going to do?

09:48.255 --> 09:50.496
She's going to die, John.

09:50.591 --> 09:53.503
D'Argo, I know that.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.380
What are you supposed to do?

09:55.471 --> 09:57.211
Zhaan:
Comfort her, John.

09:57.306 --> 10:00.093
Provide support, ease her
journey into the next realm.

10:00.184 --> 10:03.176
I'm to assist her in the
ritual of passing.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.510
Whoa.

10:05.397 --> 10:06.512
Ritual?

10:06.607 --> 10:07.972
A bonding.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.603
An emotional and spiritual link
is forged, John.

10:10.694 --> 10:14.107
As I understand it, when
the Orican dies,

10:14.198 --> 10:18.191
the attendant sanctifies the
ascent by transferring
energy to her.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.992
Strike... two.

10:21.079 --> 10:24.822
I do not like the sound of
"transferring energy" either.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.829
The process only involves
little risk.

10:27.920 --> 10:28.830
How little risk?

10:28.921 --> 10:30.331
Oh, no, let me put it this way.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.413
How wrong can it go?

10:39.348 --> 10:41.054
lcould die.

10:41.141 --> 10:45.430
I do not understand, D'Argo.
What do you get out of it?

10:45.521 --> 10:46.761
You know what?

10:46.855 --> 10:48.391
You sound like Rygel.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.815
Luxan's consider it a great
privilege, John, to attend
an Orican.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.518
No, not merely a privilege.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.947
It is the highest honor
we know.

10:59.034 --> 11:03.903
So you get your name on the
Orican honor roll and that's it.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.455
Zhaan:
You also go part of the way
into the next realm, John.

11:07.543 --> 11:09.249
When you come back,
you've seen...

11:09.336 --> 11:11.873
If you get back.

11:11.964 --> 11:16.503
When you come back, you've had
a glimpse of the other side.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.174
I envy you, D'Argo.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.718
Don't...

11:20.764 --> 11:22.379
Don't envy him.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.216
He hasn't made up his mind yet.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.347
Yes, l have.

11:40.242 --> 11:41.527
(door opens)

11:41.618 --> 11:42.949
Oh, you're back.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.071
D'Argo:
Only briefly.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.117
Did you find your Luxan?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.662
Yes. I'll tell you
about it later.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.957
Or, if I don't, Zhaan and
Crichton will.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.292
Where's Crichton?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.712
(Nilaam coughing)

12:04.391 --> 12:07.303
I'm not dead yet.

12:07.394 --> 12:11.888
No. I didn't expect that
you were.

12:11.982 --> 12:15.065
But you were hoping I was.

12:15.152 --> 12:20.863
Hoping I had quietly slipped
away before D'Argo had a
chance to return.

12:20.949 --> 12:24.487
You need to understand
something.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.411
I'm worried about my friend.

12:27.497 --> 12:31.240
Commendable, but a
waste of time.

12:31.335 --> 12:34.953
His fate is out of
your control.

12:35.047 --> 12:38.335
Yes, it's in your control.
That's what worries me.

12:42.012 --> 12:46.346
The spiritual realm
frightens you?

12:47.976 --> 12:51.844
Losing those I care about
frightens me.

12:55.901 --> 13:00.861
Isn't this where you're
supposed to say "don't worry,
I'm not going to hurt D'Argo"?

13:02.324 --> 13:07.910
I can guarantee no such thing.

13:10.332 --> 13:16.749
I will, however, promise that
I will do all I can to keep
him from harm.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.125
It's not very comforting.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.712
It's the best I can do.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.384
( scoffs )

13:28.225 --> 13:30.557
Okay.

13:30.644 --> 13:36.560
This Ritual of Passing.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.641
How important is it?

13:38.735 --> 13:45.402
You mean, why don't I just
die like any other being?

13:46.034 --> 13:48.320
( chuckles )

13:48.412 --> 13:52.325
Yeah, I mean, why don't you
just die like any other being?

13:52.416 --> 13:54.202
I could.

13:55.043 --> 13:58.251
But I don't want to.

13:58.338 --> 14:06.962
Do you realize that I haven't
even seen another Luxan for
nine cycles?

14:07.055 --> 14:08.431
Nine?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.298
And now I'm...

14:11.393 --> 14:15.261
too frail to make the
journey home.

14:17.232 --> 14:25.401
Have you any idea what it's
like to be separated from
your own kind?

14:27.284 --> 14:30.276
Yeah, matter of fact, I do.

14:33.373 --> 14:38.413
Then you can't begrudge me
this one last wish.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.059
(door warbling)

14:59.274 --> 15:02.016
Packing up all your stuff?

15:02.652 --> 15:04.392
Only the Luxan objects.

15:04.488 --> 15:09.278
Oh, you're going to show them
off to that ancient mystic
you dredged up.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.283
Is there some reason why
you would care?

15:12.370 --> 15:15.157
Just don't want you to
miss an opportunity.

15:15.248 --> 15:20.459
Bet your new friend would pay
quite well for some genuine
Luxan artifacts.

15:20.545 --> 15:23.082
This is not a trading
expedition.

15:23.173 --> 15:25.004
Oh, I understand.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.957
This is one of your countrymen.

15:27.052 --> 15:30.089
You don't want to sully your
relationship with commerce.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.169
( chuckles )

15:31.264 --> 15:33.596
Let me do that.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.925
Ten microts with the old fossil
and we'll be in profit...

15:37.020 --> 15:39.636
Clamp it, frog lips.

15:39.731 --> 15:40.891
Hey.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.142
Zhaan told me you're...

15:42.234 --> 15:44.850
you're going to do some kind
of ritual thing.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.606
That's right.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.905
(mumbling)
-So, is it dangerous?

16:00.043 --> 16:01.783
Not in the least.

16:01.878 --> 16:04.290
(mumbling)

16:04.381 --> 16:06.667
I'll be back soon.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.000
Make sure he doesn't eat
my share of the food.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.256
(mumbling)

16:12.347 --> 16:14.212
( Rygel grunts)
-I will.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.554
You heard him.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.350
Yes, I heard him.

16:19.437 --> 16:23.055
But somehow, I don't
believe him.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.874
D'Argo:
Are you ready?

16:46.965 --> 16:48.375
No.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.792
I know it's time.

16:51.887 --> 16:56.130
I'm old, weak and in pain.

16:56.224 --> 17:00.183
I know the next realm
will welcome me.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.560
Still, it's...

17:02.647 --> 17:04.763
it's not easy to...

17:04.858 --> 17:06.519
to let go...

17:06.610 --> 17:09.352
To enter the darkness.

17:10.614 --> 17:15.028
Perhaps that's why Oricans
have attendants.

17:15.118 --> 17:19.452
To strengthen our resolve
as much as our spirit.

17:27.005 --> 17:30.338
Your strength is impressive.

17:30.425 --> 17:33.417
I hope it is sufficient.

17:33.970 --> 17:37.713
I'm sure it will be.

17:37.807 --> 17:42.050
(Nilaam chanting in
native language)

17:58.370 --> 18:02.033
( D'Argo joins in chanting )

18:09.422 --> 18:13.882
(chanting intensifies )

18:29.359 --> 18:32.647
(chanting continues)

18:34.322 --> 18:38.315
D'Argo, your spirit's
so strong!

18:38.410 --> 18:39.445
(panting)

18:39.536 --> 18:41.367
I've never felt such power!

18:41.454 --> 18:44.287
I must try!

18:44.374 --> 18:46.831
( chanting )

18:56.219 --> 18:59.211
( D'Argo screams )

19:00.432 --> 19:01.217
D'Argo?

19:01.308 --> 19:02.468
( screaming )

19:02.559 --> 19:03.639
D'Argo!

19:03.727 --> 19:05.342
What's going on in there?

19:05.437 --> 19:07.143
(Nilaam chanting)

19:07.230 --> 19:09.437
( D'Argo screaming )

19:12.652 --> 19:14.438
D'Argo?!

19:14.529 --> 19:16.520
(chanting and screaming
continues )

19:24.831 --> 19:26.696
( groans exhaustedly)

19:26.791 --> 19:28.827
Nilaam:
Leave us.
The ritual isn't done.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.204
The hell it ain't.
This party's over.

19:31.296 --> 19:32.285
You're too late.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.757
I said, it's over.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.798
(yells)

19:38.345 --> 19:39.755
( groans )

19:39.846 --> 19:41.427
Damn!

19:46.394 --> 19:48.259
D'Argo, you okay?

19:48.355 --> 19:49.640
John, what happened?

19:49.731 --> 19:51.687
I don't know. Ask grandma here.

19:51.775 --> 19:54.266
Ah, it worked!

19:54.361 --> 19:56.977
lt... it really worked.

19:57.072 --> 19:59.563
No pain, no age.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.323
D'Argo...

20:02.410 --> 20:04.321
We did it.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.448
(laughing)

20:12.962 --> 20:15.339
You've given me life.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.334
Zhaan?

20:17.425 --> 20:19.586
Aeryn?

20:19.677 --> 20:21.338
Need some help in...

20:22.597 --> 20:24.337
Hey...

20:24.432 --> 20:25.182
(Aeryn laughs)

20:25.266 --> 20:27.131
What have you done?

20:27.227 --> 20:28.182
Nothing.

20:28.269 --> 20:29.975
Well, you must have
done something.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.143
ldidn't do anything.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.222
lt, itjust froze up
all around me.

20:33.316 --> 20:34.977
Get me out of here.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.184
When did I become your servant?

20:37.278 --> 20:38.893
(sighing)

20:38.988 --> 20:40.194
Don't frell around. Just...

20:40.281 --> 20:42.272
Just get me out of here, okay?

20:43.243 --> 20:44.949
What's the hurry, Chiana?

20:45.036 --> 20:47.698
You're not allergic to Moya's
amnexus fluids, are you?

20:47.789 --> 20:48.995
Oh, yeah, very funny, Aeryn.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.788
Look, can you please
just do something?

20:50.875 --> 20:54.208
Zhaan. Finally someone who's
a little more useful.

20:54.295 --> 20:55.671
What did she do?

20:55.755 --> 20:57.495
ldidn't do anything.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.841
| just...

20:58.925 --> 21:01.211
Pilot, do you know anything
about this?

21:01.302 --> 21:05.215
Only that Moya's hydric system
is failing on a number of tiers.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.843
Cause unknown.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.970
Crichton:
D'Argo, you okay?

21:10.895 --> 21:14.058
He's more than okay.

21:14.149 --> 21:18.313
He's the most powerful Luxan
l have ever known.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.145
You did this?

21:22.240 --> 21:24.276
I'm not sure how.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.028
Was that supposed to happen?

21:26.119 --> 21:28.701
No. l was supposed to die

21:28.788 --> 21:32.121
but when I sensed your
astonishing power

21:32.208 --> 21:36.292
I decided to try the Ritual
of Renewal instead.

21:36.379 --> 21:37.539
See how well it worked?

21:37.630 --> 21:40.042
Look princess, you damn
near killed him!

21:40.133 --> 21:42.545
D'Argo:
Actually, I've, uh...

21:42.635 --> 21:44.466
I've never felt better.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.044
Neither have I.

21:48.683 --> 21:50.799
Yeah. Well, you... you could
have killed him.

21:50.894 --> 21:53.806
But she didn't.

21:53.897 --> 22:00.018
His pain was short-lived and
I intend to make up for it.

22:04.365 --> 22:08.278
Yeah, D'Arg, I'm just going
to... just buzz up to
Moya and see...

22:08.369 --> 22:10.325
I think that's a
good idea, John.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.244
Oh, weirder and weirder.

22:17.420 --> 22:20.287
( panting excitedly)

22:31.017 --> 22:32.848
Your taste...

22:33.686 --> 22:34.937
What?

22:35.021 --> 22:37.512
I can taste you.

22:37.607 --> 22:39.598
I can move.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.228
I can breathe.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.731
I can feel.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.903
(D'Argo laughing)

22:45.990 --> 22:49.232
You are glorious.

22:49.327 --> 22:51.659
We are glorious.

22:51.746 --> 22:54.237
We must celebrate.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.332
(both laughing)

22:58.419 --> 23:00.546
You gave me this.

23:00.630 --> 23:04.464
I think it's only fair that
you enjoy it with me.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.801
(Chiana grunting)

23:08.888 --> 23:10.844
Ow! Watch it!

23:10.932 --> 23:12.342
Careful with that thing.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.048
(grunting)

23:14.143 --> 23:17.180
Aeryn:
Do you want to get
out of here or not?

23:17.272 --> 23:21.060
Zhaan, I'm not having any
luck here. How about you
with the solvent?

23:22.569 --> 23:26.608
The solidified amnexus resists
everything I throw at it.

23:26.698 --> 23:30.282
Same here. Even the DRDs are
having difficulties.

23:30.368 --> 23:33.360
Pilot:
We have a more serious problem.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.786
Oh, come on.
More serious than mine?

23:35.873 --> 23:41.209
Certain areas of Moya's outer
skin appear to be deteriorating.

23:41.796 --> 23:42.876
What's wrong, Pilot?

23:42.964 --> 23:46.172
I don't know.
Neither does Moya.

23:46.259 --> 23:48.090
Zhaan:
Patch me through to
Crichton and D'Argo.

23:50.138 --> 23:51.969
And Pilot has no idea.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.091
Zhaan:
None.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.218
We could use some extra
hands, John.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.722
Can you and D'Argo
return at once?

23:57.812 --> 23:59.723
Yeah. No. I'll be right there.

23:59.814 --> 24:02.021
Uh...

24:02.108 --> 24:05.350
D'Argo, he might, uh,
be a while.

24:07.071 --> 24:09.187
He's revitalizing.

24:10.408 --> 24:13.775
(D'Argo and Nilaam moaning
passionately )

24:16.205 --> 24:18.412
(Nilaam laughing)

24:21.336 --> 24:23.327
Oh...

24:23.421 --> 24:25.912
I need a Ritual of Renewal
myself.

24:26.007 --> 24:27.292
(Nilaam laughing)

24:27.383 --> 24:29.544
Have I finally sapped
your strength?

24:29.636 --> 24:32.719
Only temporarily.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.012
Let me know when you recover.

24:35.099 --> 24:38.136
Believe me, you will.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.221
You know, D'Argo,

24:40.313 --> 24:45.273
I've hardly been able to leave
this bed for over six cycles.

24:45.360 --> 24:49.228
And now that I can,
I don't want to.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.984
Oh? You keeping me
prisoner, huh?

24:52.075 --> 24:53.565
Absolutely.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.275
(laughing)

24:55.370 --> 24:59.033
I always made a note that I'd
never be taken prisoner again.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.455
So much for that, huh?

25:03.252 --> 25:06.289
Nilaam, what do you
want to do now?

25:06.381 --> 25:07.461
(moans)

25:07.548 --> 25:08.924
Besides that?

25:09.008 --> 25:10.214
(chuckling lightly)

25:10.301 --> 25:13.589
Well...

25:13.680 --> 25:15.887
start a new life.

25:15.973 --> 25:19.215
Not in the Uncharted
Territories. I want to go home.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.221
You can do that?

25:21.312 --> 25:24.179
D'Argo, I can do anything.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.685
I can guide your ship home.

25:26.776 --> 25:28.812
I can help your friends.

25:28.903 --> 25:31.940
I could even make you
a real general.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.271
My son.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.652
I want to see my son again.

25:35.743 --> 25:37.324
Then you will.

25:37.412 --> 25:40.279
But I have no idea where he is.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.785
Then we will find him.

25:44.419 --> 25:47.502
Anything is possible now.

25:56.389 --> 25:57.344
Pilot?

25:57.432 --> 26:00.048
There's been an outer
hull breach.

26:00.143 --> 26:03.226
Tier 20. Hammond side.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.439
Decompression?
-No.

26:05.523 --> 26:09.983
Moya's inner walls appear
to be unaffected,

26:10.069 --> 26:11.809
so far.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.494
Is this a good time to tell
you that, uh...

26:21.581 --> 26:23.162
I can't feel my feet?

26:23.249 --> 26:27.208
If we had any idea how Moya
made it, we could patent
this stuff.

26:27.295 --> 26:28.660
Useless.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.959
I wonder if I've got any
grenades left.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.756
She was kidding, right?

26:34.844 --> 26:36.050
Tell me that she was kidding.

26:36.137 --> 26:39.345
Well, with Aeryn,
you never know.

26:39.432 --> 26:43.596
What emergency could possibly
justify waking me up?

26:43.686 --> 26:45.722
How about breaches in
the outer hull?

26:45.813 --> 26:49.556
Oh, aren't the inner
hulls secure?

26:49.650 --> 26:52.266
Yeah, but we need you to take
your scooter out there

26:52.361 --> 26:55.569
in the tight spaces and
check for weak spots.

26:56.407 --> 26:58.238
Can't the DRDs do that?

26:58.326 --> 27:00.692
They're already doing it.
Doesn't mean you can't help.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.243
He's right, toad face.

27:02.330 --> 27:05.242
Pitch in, make yourself
useful for a change.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.289
Rygel:
If I must.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.536
But you're worrying for nothing.

27:08.628 --> 27:12.416
Hull breaches are nearly
unheard of on Leviathans.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.340
Ooh...

27:16.427 --> 27:18.338
Crichton:
Pilot, what the hell's
going on?

27:18.429 --> 27:21.296
Inner hull breach.
Sluice chamber!

27:21.849 --> 27:23.350
( screaming )

27:24.685 --> 27:27.768
Pilot! Seal off this tier!

27:28.773 --> 27:30.138
(Chiana screaming)

27:30.233 --> 27:31.723
Crichton:
Rygel, grab my hand!

27:31.818 --> 27:33.058
( screaming )

27:33.152 --> 27:34.653
Rygel, hang on!

27:34.737 --> 27:36.238
Help me! Help me!

27:41.410 --> 27:43.241
Sparky, grab my hand!

27:43.329 --> 27:44.865
Rygel!

27:45.414 --> 27:46.699
I can't!

27:46.791 --> 27:48.156
( screaming )

27:48.251 --> 27:50.207
Rygel!
( Rygel screaming )

27:52.255 --> 27:54.291
(everyone panting )

27:54.382 --> 27:56.668
Help! Help!

27:56.759 --> 27:58.875
( Rygel grunting )

27:58.970 --> 28:01.211
Well, what do you know?

28:01.305 --> 28:03.762
He has made himself useful.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.590
(grunting)

28:05.685 --> 28:07.391
I'm... I'm stuck.

28:07.478 --> 28:10.185
Decompression has ceased.
What happened?

28:10.273 --> 28:13.356
Crichton:
We got lucky.
Sparky's got a big ass.

28:13.442 --> 28:14.306
Pardon?

28:14.402 --> 28:16.688
Butt... hole.
I'll explain later, Pilot.

28:16.779 --> 28:19.862
The good news is...

28:19.949 --> 28:21.564
No leak.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.615
You're a tight fit, sluggo,

28:23.703 --> 28:25.739
as long as you don't move.

28:27.665 --> 28:30.077
Don't move.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.873
Call that good news?

28:31.961 --> 28:33.121
I want out.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.999
Yeah, no! No, no, you want in.

28:36.090 --> 28:38.297
Not out, in. Not out.

28:38.885 --> 28:39.874
Hey.

28:39.969 --> 28:41.675
What did you see from
the outside?

28:41.762 --> 28:45.721
A few gaps in the outer hull
and your backside hanging
out in space.

28:45.808 --> 28:47.799
Am I... intact?

28:47.894 --> 28:50.886
You seem to be all there, but I
can't say I looked too closely.

28:51.856 --> 28:53.266
Crichton:
What the hell is this?

28:53.357 --> 28:55.143
That is a piece from the edge
of the largest hole

28:55.234 --> 28:57.316
and it came off very easily
in my hands.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.359
Well, let's hope it gives
Zhaan a clue.

28:59.447 --> 29:00.402
(grunting)

29:00.489 --> 29:02.195
Indeed.

29:03.659 --> 29:04.819
(grunting)

29:04.911 --> 29:06.321
Whoa! Hold still.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.869
What? What are you trying to
do, kill all of us now?

29:08.956 --> 29:11.288
I can't help it.
I'm being crushed.

29:11.375 --> 29:12.239
I can hardly breathe.

29:12.335 --> 29:15.452
Then don't breathe.

29:18.299 --> 29:21.917
Rygel:
Who's that?
And why is she here?

29:22.011 --> 29:25.128
This is Nilaam.
She's here to help.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.599
How could she possibly help us?

29:28.225 --> 29:29.931
She's an Orican.

29:30.019 --> 29:30.849
Oh.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.519
Okay. I'll repeat the question.

29:33.606 --> 29:36.393
Don't. Hold the question.

29:36.484 --> 29:41.353
Nilaam, if there's something
you can do, please do it.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.278
Don't you dare touch me.

29:43.366 --> 29:45.527
I don't trust Luxans.

29:45.618 --> 29:47.449
(whimpering)
I'm not going to touch you.

29:47.536 --> 29:50.323
I'm going to heal the
outer skin of your ship.

29:50.414 --> 29:51.950
You are? Well, hurry.

29:52.041 --> 29:54.407
Does this look comfortable
to you?

29:54.502 --> 29:56.163
I thought you said she
was ancient!

29:56.253 --> 29:57.868
Later!

29:58.506 --> 30:00.246
( Rygel grunting )

30:03.803 --> 30:06.089
(rumbling)

30:06.180 --> 30:08.011
(glass breaking )

30:08.099 --> 30:09.680
John, what's going on?

30:10.393 --> 30:11.803
Zhaan, did you feel that?

30:11.894 --> 30:14.761
Pilot:
Tremors are occurring
all through Moya.

30:14.855 --> 30:17.312
They're increasing the
deterioration!

30:22.113 --> 30:23.944
Hey, look, Nilaam.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.022
You're making it worse.

30:26.117 --> 30:27.698
Stop.

30:27.785 --> 30:31.369
It's a healing incantation.
It has to work.

30:31.455 --> 30:32.570
Should work?

30:32.665 --> 30:35.202
Try another. Try anything.

30:35.292 --> 30:38.250
I need to meditate,
find another way.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.328
D'Argo, is there a
private place?

30:40.423 --> 30:41.788
Come with me.

30:57.440 --> 31:01.058
(whispering chant)

31:04.363 --> 31:07.196
Please D'Argo, don't disturb
me now. I'm trying to
find a cure...

31:07.283 --> 31:09.023
We did this, didn't we?

31:09.118 --> 31:10.574
We caused this problem.

31:10.661 --> 31:12.947
We're harming Moya.

31:14.957 --> 31:17.448
Nilaam, tell me.

31:18.002 --> 31:20.163
I didn't know.

31:20.254 --> 31:22.165
You have to believe that.

31:22.256 --> 31:23.086
(sighs)

31:23.174 --> 31:24.914
Please believe that.

31:25.009 --> 31:26.965
(sighs)

31:36.812 --> 31:38.427
What happened?

31:40.524 --> 31:44.358
During the ritual,
the power I sensed.

31:44.445 --> 31:46.231
I thought it was yours.

31:46.322 --> 31:49.780
I didn't realize the ship
was a bio-mechanoid.

31:49.867 --> 31:52.199
So you bonded with
Moya's energy.

31:52.286 --> 31:53.241
I didn't know.

31:53.329 --> 31:54.489
Now you know.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.037
And I can make things right.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.705
There must be a way.

31:58.793 --> 31:59.828
How can you be sure?

31:59.919 --> 32:03.457
Because this shouldn't
be happening.

32:03.547 --> 32:07.165
This ritual shouldn't keep
draining strength from
the Leviathan.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.669
She should recover.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.297
She is dying.

32:10.387 --> 32:12.423
And I can save her.

32:12.515 --> 32:15.302
I need to consult my
Tevex scrolls.

32:15.392 --> 32:17.553
Take me back to the planet.

32:17.645 --> 32:20.136
I cannot abandon Moya.

32:20.231 --> 32:22.187
All of my resources are
in my chamber.

32:22.274 --> 32:25.141
Potions, artifacts, ancient
manuscripts.

32:25.236 --> 32:27.227
They'll have an answer.

32:27.321 --> 32:28.731
Look.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.533
I'm a disease to this ship.

32:34.620 --> 32:39.205
Get me away from her. It might
at least slow the process down.

32:39.291 --> 32:42.249
D'Argo:
Slowing the process down
is not good enough.

32:42.336 --> 32:45.544
Well let me try everything
I can.

32:45.631 --> 32:48.589
It's a little odd, don't you
think, that all of Moya's
problems developed

32:48.676 --> 32:51.338
just as this shaman woman
turned herself young.

32:51.428 --> 32:53.760
It's not necessarily linked.

32:53.848 --> 32:56.055
If it is, Nilaam should be able
to find a solution.

32:56.142 --> 32:58.133
I'm not sure she wants
to find a solution.

32:58.227 --> 33:00.013
Pilot:
Officer Sun, may I speak
with you, please?

33:00.104 --> 33:01.344
What is it, Pilot?

33:01.438 --> 33:03.303
I would prefer to discuss
it in person.

33:03.399 --> 33:05.264
I'll be right there.

33:09.697 --> 33:11.312
Pilot.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.530
(gasping)

33:13.617 --> 33:15.824
My... connection...

33:15.911 --> 33:17.742
with Moya...

33:17.830 --> 33:19.786
affecting me...

33:19.874 --> 33:22.661
as her systems fail.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.662
What is it, Pilot?
How can we fix it?

33:24.753 --> 33:26.289
Don't know.

33:26.380 --> 33:29.372
Amnexus solidification.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.502
Skin deterioration.

33:31.594 --> 33:36.133
Only happens during old age.

33:36.223 --> 33:40.011
Moya's still young.
Makes no sense.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.263
It makes too much sense.
Where's Nilaam?

33:42.354 --> 33:44.265
I will check.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.187
Take a moment.

33:46.275 --> 33:48.641
Senses unclear.

33:48.736 --> 33:50.852
(gasping)

33:50.946 --> 33:53.528
Found her. She's with D'Argo.

33:53.616 --> 33:56.733
Tier six, on their way to
the Transport Hangar.

33:56.827 --> 33:59.785
I don't know if this can be
reversed, Pilot, but I
promise you this.

33:59.872 --> 34:02.534
I won't Nilaam keep
what she's stolen.

34:06.420 --> 34:08.035
Hey, what are you doing?
-D'Argo and his woman

34:08.130 --> 34:09.540
are going to make a run for it.
I'm going to stop them.

34:09.632 --> 34:11.088
Uh-uh. Not with that thing,
you're not.

34:11.175 --> 34:12.415
Watch me.

34:19.183 --> 34:20.218
Aeryn!

34:23.854 --> 34:25.230
No!

35:02.434 --> 35:04.390
That won't hold them for long.

35:06.188 --> 35:08.179
Come on.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.686
D'Argo, we must go.

35:25.207 --> 35:26.492
What was that?

35:26.583 --> 35:28.790
Pins and needles!
You're asking the
wrong spaceman.

35:28.877 --> 35:30.413
Pilot, did they get away?

35:30.504 --> 35:35.624
( gasping ):
A Transport Pod left Moya
a quarter arn ago.

35:35.718 --> 35:39.131
D'Argo:
Nilaam, you have already tried
four different incantations.

35:39.221 --> 35:41.212
It is not working.

35:41.307 --> 35:43.218
Nilaam:
I know.

35:43.309 --> 35:46.392
Your Transport Pod.
How far can it get us?

35:46.478 --> 35:48.309
Leave my friends?

35:48.397 --> 35:51.013
Some distance between me
and Moya might stop
the energy drain.

35:51.108 --> 35:53.349
I...
-And if it doesn't?

35:53.444 --> 35:55.230
D'Argo, it is just a ship.

35:55.321 --> 35:58.279
Moya is notjust a ship.

35:58.991 --> 36:00.777
She's alive.

36:00.868 --> 36:03.405
And you are taking her life
to restore your own.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.328
The life of a Leviathan for
the life of an Orican.

36:06.415 --> 36:10.249
How can an Orican justify
taking life? Have you
forgotten who you are?

36:10.336 --> 36:12.201
Have you forgotten
what I can do?

36:12.296 --> 36:16.335
I have not forgotten what you
cannot do which is restore
Moya's life!

36:20.387 --> 36:21.888
Does that not suggest to you

36:21.972 --> 36:25.510
that you have taken something
that you really should
not have?

36:26.894 --> 36:29.556
I can't give it back now.

36:30.356 --> 36:32.642
I can't lose this.

36:36.195 --> 36:38.060
Lose you.

36:40.115 --> 36:41.946
D'Argo, I...

36:43.202 --> 36:45.318
I don't know what to do.

36:48.123 --> 36:50.375
Tell me what to do.

36:52.836 --> 36:54.337
Crichton:
D'Argo!

36:55.339 --> 36:57.330
D'Argo?

36:57.424 --> 36:59.836
It's me, John.

37:01.970 --> 37:04.177
We have to talk.

37:09.019 --> 37:10.850
D'Argo!

37:41.176 --> 37:43.212
We're out of time.

37:43.303 --> 37:47.216
Moya's hull is deteriorating
fast and Pilot can't
do a thing.

37:48.308 --> 37:50.299
You know what's causing it.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.723
John...

37:55.065 --> 37:57.522
Nilaam isn't evil.

37:58.902 --> 38:01.518
That doesn't change anything.

38:01.613 --> 38:05.322
Moya, Pilot, Aeryn, they will
never forgive her.

38:05.409 --> 38:07.115
They may never even forgive me.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.158
But you...

38:09.246 --> 38:11.737
you must understand.

38:12.332 --> 38:15.199
I understand.

38:15.294 --> 38:17.580
What she is doing is
killing Moya.

38:17.671 --> 38:20.162
She didn't mean it.

38:20.257 --> 38:21.918
Doesn't matter.

38:22.009 --> 38:24.295
She honestly thought it was my
energy that restored her youth.

38:24.386 --> 38:28.004
She's trying everything she can
to restore Moya's health.

38:28.098 --> 38:31.431
D'Argo, I don't know...

38:31.518 --> 38:34.009
what she intended.

38:35.147 --> 38:37.729
What I know...

38:37.816 --> 38:40.057
is that it's murder.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.274
And you're the only one
who can stop it.

38:44.364 --> 38:47.447
Don't you think I know
what has to be done?!

38:52.164 --> 38:55.122
(crying quietly)

39:14.311 --> 39:16.552
(grunting)

39:22.027 --> 39:25.440
I came here to end this.

39:27.282 --> 39:29.364
And | Will.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.880
(door opening)

39:47.678 --> 39:49.418
(footsteps approaching )

39:57.312 --> 39:59.177
It's time.

40:01.316 --> 40:05.309
D'Argo, the gifts you gave me,

40:05.404 --> 40:09.989
youth, happiness, passion.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.405
I know I can't
keep them, but...

40:15.247 --> 40:18.660
I have treasured them.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.082
As I have treasured you.

40:29.720 --> 40:32.086
I'm not afraid anymore.

40:33.807 --> 40:36.298
I've chosen my path.

40:38.061 --> 40:43.101
I just don't know if I have
the will to travel it.

40:43.191 --> 40:46.604
I turned back once.
I can't turn back again.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.230
I need your strength once more.

41:01.918 --> 41:06.252
( D'Argo chanting in
alien language)

41:15.182 --> 41:17.389
(chanting continues)

41:28.904 --> 41:31.486
(chanting grows louder)

41:37.871 --> 41:39.782
(groaning in pain)

41:53.303 --> 41:56.010
(speaking alien language)

42:47.065 --> 42:49.056
(Chiana laughing)

42:52.028 --> 42:54.690
( laughs )

42:54.781 --> 42:57.272
You know, until today I...

42:57.367 --> 43:00.575
I never really realized how
much I love my feet.

43:00.662 --> 43:02.243
Frell your feet.

43:02.330 --> 43:04.787
How about loving your life.

43:06.042 --> 43:08.124
I don't know how you
survive, Ryg.

43:08.211 --> 43:11.703
Your butt must be made out
of reinforced crandak.

43:11.798 --> 43:13.789
I have no idea what crandak is,

43:13.884 --> 43:17.843
but if I've lost any sensation
below middle level

43:17.929 --> 43:21.842
then I'm going to test how
sensitive D'Argo's nether
regions are,

43:21.933 --> 43:23.139
with a red hot...

43:23.226 --> 43:26.844
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo. Ooh, careful.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.189
Ticklish spot.

43:28.273 --> 43:30.138
You're looking better already.

43:30.233 --> 43:33.225
Is there anything I can to to
help speed up the healing
process?

43:33.320 --> 43:35.151
Nothing I am aware of.

43:35.238 --> 43:40.198
Moya and I thank you for
your concern.

43:40.285 --> 43:44.244
Pilot, what is the normal
life span of a Leviathan?

43:44.331 --> 43:48.870
Uh... many have lived
over 300 cycles.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.245
What about your species?

43:50.337 --> 43:52.919
Normally, a thousand cycles
or more.

43:53.006 --> 43:57.966
However, when we bond with
Leviathans, we live no longer
than they do.

43:58.053 --> 44:01.386
So when Moya eventually
does die...

44:01.473 --> 44:04.215
I will go as well.

44:04.309 --> 44:07.767
I would not have it
any other way.

44:37.926 --> 44:39.882
You want me to get lost?

44:41.638 --> 44:44.801
Why would I want you
