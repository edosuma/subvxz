[Adam] Previously
on What About Brian:

00:01.834 --> 00:04.542
- I've gone crazy, haven't I?
- No, you're not crazy.

00:04.542 --> 00:07.166
You don't know what it's like
to do this alone.

00:07.166 --> 00:10.166
Carrie is suffering
from a permanent hearing loss.

00:10.166 --> 00:12.834
- Marjorie isn't my ex.
- Don't even start, Brian.

00:12.834 --> 00:16.375
You broke up a wedding
and didn't say a word
to me about it.

00:16.375 --> 00:20.500
Maybe we could not
tell anyone else that
I'm back in town just yet.

00:21.959 --> 00:25.000
[Deena] I didn't have anything
to do with this, honey. I swear.

00:25.834 --> 00:28.166
[rock music plays]

00:34.500 --> 00:35.667
Isn't that Deena?

00:36.750 --> 00:39.333
Hey, guys, come on.

00:39.333 --> 00:43.291
- I knew that was her
the other night.
- You knew who was what?

00:43.291 --> 00:46.208
- The other night?
- I should've never
listened to Ivy.

00:46.208 --> 00:48.875
She said it was guilt,
my mind was playing tricks.

00:48.875 --> 00:51.709
OK, one of you needs
to tell us what's going on.

00:51.709 --> 00:56.875
That was Marjorie.
Marjorie's here.

01:06.333 --> 01:10.542
- She's so still.
- She is still. She's sleeping.

01:10.542 --> 01:12.417
Doesn't look like she's
breathing.

01:12.417 --> 01:14.875
She was fine
the first time you came in here.

01:14.875 --> 01:18.542
She was fine the
second time you came in here.

01:18.542 --> 01:21.000
She's fine now.
I know what I'm doing.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.250
She doesn't sound like
she's breathing either. Bella.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.709
If you want to help Bella,
try turning down
the air conditioner.

01:27.709 --> 01:30.083
It's far too cold
in this room for a newborn.

01:30.083 --> 01:31.542
[Nicole] Oh.

01:32.333 --> 01:35.208
Thank God. She's OK.

Yellow circle.

01:39.583 --> 01:42.792

- [toy] Blue triangle.
Hee-hee-hee.

01:42.792 --> 01:45.041
- You know what? You're fired.
- What?

01:45.041 --> 01:48.291
Yeah, just go, OK? Just go.
I don't like your attitude.

01:48.291 --> 01:52.000
- Attitude?
I'm great with Bella.
- You're not great with me.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.458
So just go,
and I'll send you a check.

01:55.667 --> 01:58.083
[Bella still crying]

01:58.083 --> 02:04.083
[sighs] I just wanted
to see them when I was ready.
On my terms. Not like this.

02:04.083 --> 02:07.583
Not in some restaurant. Not when
they're on some double date.

02:07.583 --> 02:13.083
I know, honey. But sometimes,
things just happen for a reason.

02:13.083 --> 02:16.959
It doesn't exactly
look like they're hurrying
over here to say hello.

02:16.959 --> 02:20.458
- So how are they?
- It took a while, but, uh...

02:20.458 --> 02:22.417
I think they're doing good.

02:22.417 --> 02:24.625
They're both fine.
They've moved on.

02:24.625 --> 02:27.417
- That's good.
- They haven't moved "on" on.

02:27.417 --> 02:31.834
You know, Brian and Bridget
just started dating,

02:31.834 --> 02:35.625
and let's see, Heather,
we don't really know
what that's all about.

02:35.625 --> 02:38.792
Adam and Heather,
is that serious?

02:40.583 --> 02:44.458
Well, that waiter
is taking a while, huh?

02:44.458 --> 02:45.959
- Deen?
- Huh?

02:45.959 --> 02:49.125
- Deena?
- They're married, Marjorie.

02:49.125 --> 02:52.208
So I guess...

02:52.208 --> 02:55.667
- Yeah, it is kind of serious.
- [laughs]

03:04.458 --> 03:08.041
This is getting ridiculous.
Just get it over with
and go say hi.

03:08.041 --> 03:10.375
We're not going over.
We're eating dinner.

03:10.375 --> 03:13.166
And the conversation's
been scintillating so far.

03:13.166 --> 03:15.875
Should we just
get it over with?

03:17.667 --> 03:19.000
Fine.

03:21.667 --> 03:24.333
- Great double date so far, huh?
- Yeah, great!

03:26.792 --> 03:30.667
[sighs] Maybe one of us
should call her or e-mail.

03:30.667 --> 03:33.750
A text could be good.
You wanna text her?

03:33.750 --> 03:37.417
I don't want to do anything.
I just want to forget
this ever happened.

03:39.583 --> 03:41.291
[tires screeching]

03:42.875 --> 03:45.208
You need to slow down.
You're gonna kill us!

03:45.208 --> 03:48.166
- I have to pee.
- I'm gonna cut you some slack.

03:48.166 --> 03:51.041
Obviously, this Marjorie thing
is bothering you.

03:51.041 --> 03:55.125
There's really no reason
to be upset. I saw her,
and it's all good.

03:55.125 --> 03:57.750
If you mean incredibly awkward,
it was fantastic.

03:57.750 --> 04:01.333
I didn't feel anything.
It was like seeing
an old friend. Nothing more.

04:01.333 --> 04:04.709
- [car accelerates]
- [tires screech]

04:06.875 --> 04:10.542
I'm really happy for you,
and I really appreciate
what you're saying

04:10.542 --> 04:12.875
but I really have to go now.

04:25.083 --> 04:27.834
- Hey.
- Hey, where's the fire?

04:27.834 --> 04:30.875
- OK, go ahead.
Ask me how my night was.
- How was your night?

04:30.875 --> 04:35.208
We ran into, at the restaurant,
you are not going to believe
who's back.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.750
- Marjorie.
- Marjorie.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.625
- Well, you knew she was back?
- I just found out today.

04:40.625 --> 04:43.917
Deena and I saw her name
on this list because
of this situation with Carrie.

04:43.917 --> 04:48.375
- Wait, what situation
with Carrie?
- [sighs] It's not good, dude.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.583
- Talk to me.
- Carrie's deaf.

04:57.125 --> 04:58.959
She lost her hearing.

04:58.959 --> 05:04.333
I mean, she had it, right?
They tested her when she
was a baby, but somehow...

05:04.333 --> 05:06.250
She'll get it back, right?

05:06.250 --> 05:08.959
That's what we're
trying to figure out.
It doesn't look good.

05:08.959 --> 05:11.125
Is there anything
I can do to help?

05:11.125 --> 05:15.959
Come on. You just be who you
are, who you always are,
with us, with her.

05:15.959 --> 05:17.625
You know I will.

05:17.625 --> 05:22.625
And if you were cool
with Marjorie helping us out,
that would be huge.

05:22.625 --> 05:26.083
Dave, it's Carrie.
I'm OK with whatever you need.

05:26.083 --> 05:27.583
It's not gonna bother you?

05:27.583 --> 05:31.625
- Look, I'm over Marjorie.
- Yeah.

05:31.625 --> 05:34.667
I gotta tell you, man,
you look a little
sweaty and weird.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.458
That's Bridget's fault.

05:36.458 --> 05:38.250
She wasn't happy
to see Marjorie?

05:38.250 --> 05:40.333
She's fine with that.
It's her driving.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.166
- Notice how bad she drives?
- No.

05:42.166 --> 05:44.333
She cuts people off.
She doesn't signal.

05:44.333 --> 05:45.875
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh what?

05:45.875 --> 05:48.875
- How long have
you two been together?
- Six weeks.

05:48.875 --> 05:51.041

I sabotage.

I don't do that anymore. The
little things don't bother me.

Hey, honey, I forgot my
toothbrush. Do you mind
if I use yours?

06:22.333 --> 06:25.542
- Are you coming to bed soon?
- Yeah, after I finish this.

Go to bed.
I'll be there in a second.

Fear of commitment.

10:45.792 --> 10:49.709
So Carrie's file indicates
that the cochlear implant
is a viable option

10:49.709 --> 10:53.417
for her given the limited
high-decibel range
that she does hear.

10:53.417 --> 10:55.291
That's the surgery
we read about.

10:55.291 --> 10:59.333
It's an electronic device
that's surgically implanted
into the inner ear,

10:59.333 --> 11:03.125
and then she's given
an external speech processor,
which they would put,

11:03.125 --> 11:06.291
behind the ear, or she can wear
it in a belt or on a pocket.

11:06.291 --> 11:09.166
She's one.
What belt? What pocket?

11:09.166 --> 11:11.500
She's gonna just take it off
and chew on it.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.500
OK, but the surgery
could restore her hearing.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.542
- At least partially.
That's the hope.
- Not a guarantee.

11:17.542 --> 11:18.959
Nothing's a guarantee.

11:18.959 --> 11:22.667
The biggest risk is if they did
the implant and it fails,

11:22.667 --> 11:25.333
any residual hearing
could be lost.

11:25.333 --> 11:28.709
- So it's all or nothing?
- I know that this sounds risky,

11:28.709 --> 11:31.625
but the upside
for Carrie is huge.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.834
When would she be
old enough for surgery?

11:33.834 --> 11:39.000
- Any time after 12 months.
- OK, she'll be one on Saturday.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.166
Maybe we should
just cancel her party.

11:41.166 --> 11:45.000
No. We should do the party.
We keep everything
as normal as possible.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
Well, she's old enough,
so she can have the surgery.

11:50.709 --> 11:55.542
We... have to decide that.
It would be up to us.

11:55.542 --> 11:59.500
What would you do, Marjorie?
If Carrie was your daughter?

11:59.500 --> 12:02.166
As a doctor, I can't really
answer that question.

12:02.166 --> 12:05.750
But you're not just a doctor.
You're our friend.

12:05.750 --> 12:08.542
This is Carrie
we're talking about.

12:08.542 --> 12:12.834
OK. If it were up to me,
I would do the surgery.

12:15.333 --> 12:19.000
OK. Then that's
what we should do.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.375
OK. What's the emergency?
Is Bella OK?

12:29.375 --> 12:33.208
I can't get this thing to work.
Since when did women
pump milk anyway?

12:33.208 --> 12:37.583
Yeah, I've really never seen
a contraption like this before.

12:37.583 --> 12:41.208
Except at the Pleasure Hut,
but I think that
was something different.

12:41.208 --> 12:44.959
Hiya. I'm Alexa,
Bella's nanny.

12:44.959 --> 12:46.583
Hiya, how are you?

12:47.417 --> 12:49.250
Brian, focus.

12:49.250 --> 12:52.583
On your boobs? Doesn't that
fall under Alexa's jurisdiction?

12:52.583 --> 12:54.041
I don't think so.

12:54.041 --> 12:57.083
There's a bottle in the fridge.
Could you get it for me?

12:57.083 --> 13:00.917
Sure. But, I'm not all that
comfortable giving it to her.

13:00.917 --> 13:04.333
- Newborns kind of freak me out.
- [Bella fussing]

13:04.333 --> 13:06.917
Here, here. Oh.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.375
Hey.

13:11.417 --> 13:14.834
You need to fire that girl.
She's too hot to be a nanny
and too dumb.

13:14.834 --> 13:18.875
How's my baby girl? Who's the
cutest baby in the world?

13:18.875 --> 13:23.917
It's not that easy.
It's like going on one bad
blind date after another.

13:23.917 --> 13:26.917
- She can't even
find the bottle!
- Should I go help her?

13:26.917 --> 13:30.291
No. You gotta tell me
what happened last night.

13:30.291 --> 13:34.166
- The worst double date?
- I can't believe
Marjorie's back.

13:34.166 --> 13:36.792
What are the odds of you
and Adam running into her?

13:36.792 --> 13:38.333
And Heather and Bridget.

13:38.333 --> 13:41.500
- Why do I always
miss the good stuff?
- You didn't miss much.

13:41.500 --> 13:45.792
We didn't even talk.
But still, it was like
everything came rushing back.

13:45.792 --> 13:49.625
If you tell me you
have feelings for Marjorie,
I'll attach this pump...

13:49.625 --> 13:52.291
I only felt guilt for
everything I put her through.

13:52.291 --> 13:56.834
Maybe you should apologize
to Marjorie. So you can
move forward with Bridget.

13:56.834 --> 13:59.250
How long has it been anyway?
A month?

14:01.041 --> 14:02.834
It's been six weeks, OK?

14:02.834 --> 14:05.166
Don't pretend you don't know.
Everyone knows.

14:05.166 --> 14:07.583
- [Bella fussing]
- I'm not gonna sabotage!

14:07.583 --> 14:10.834
- Someone's a little sensitive.
- I gotta go.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.083
- What? I don't get a kiss?
- No.

14:16.417 --> 14:18.959
I don't get a kiss.
I don't get a kiss.

14:18.959 --> 14:22.166
Summer and I,
we had a real relationship.

14:22.166 --> 14:27.041
- That's not even her real name.
- I know. It's Heather.

14:27.041 --> 14:32.333
But she'll always
be Summer to me. We were
meant to be together, OK?

14:32.333 --> 14:34.667
She knows it as well as I do.

14:36.875 --> 14:39.208
- What's this?
- Proof.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.917
Receipts. For everything
that I bought her.

14:41.917 --> 14:47.208
A car, the ring, flat-screen,
trip home to see her mother,

14:47.208 --> 14:49.875
and I was gonna buy her
a boob job, but, well...

14:49.875 --> 14:55.500
- ...she met you first.
- This doesn't prove anything.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.291
Except that you
like to throw money away.

14:58.291 --> 15:00.000
OK.

15:01.625 --> 15:04.125
Well, then, maybe this does.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.208
[scoffs]

15:08.959 --> 15:11.375
Heather and I?

15:11.375 --> 15:13.875
We had an arrangement.
A sort of deal.

15:13.875 --> 15:16.375
Heather wouldn't
make "a sort of deal."

15:24.792 --> 15:28.208
I guess you don't know your wife
as well as you thought, huh?

15:30.250 --> 15:32.375
We should pack
and get out of here.

15:32.375 --> 15:34.041
Thank God we brought
separate cars.

15:34.041 --> 15:37.166
Could you give me a five-minute
head start for my own safety?

15:37.166 --> 15:40.250
Why are you obsessing about
my driving? It's getting mean.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.917
So I have one
less-than-perfect quality.
So what?

15:42.917 --> 15:46.291
One? Stealing the covers
and always talking
on your phone?

15:46.291 --> 15:48.375
I always have
to be available for work.

15:48.375 --> 15:52.417
- While we're having sex?
- I left my Bluetooth
in one time.

15:52.417 --> 15:56.375
How many times can you watch
the same episode
of SportsCenter?

15:56.375 --> 15:58.417
You send chain emails.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.750
I hate when you sing
in that stupid voice.

16:00.750 --> 16:04.834
And that code name
that you guys have for
hot girls? "Hey, Jimmy!"

16:04.834 --> 16:07.458
It's not as annoying
as when you talk on the phone.

16:07.458 --> 16:10.792
Oh, I'm sorry, I meant scream.
It's not a ship-to-shore call!

16:10.792 --> 16:14.291
- It's 2007.
Talk in a normal voice!
- [gasps]

16:22.458 --> 16:26.792
Wow, um...
that probably sounded...

16:26.792 --> 16:28.583
...ridiculous. I'm sorry.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.667
I think that was our first
couple fight.

16:31.667 --> 16:34.375
- I think so.
- Yeah.

16:36.291 --> 16:40.667
- So, what do we do now?
- I can think of a few ideas.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.667
- Hey, Jimmy.
- [both chuckle]

16:44.667 --> 16:46.917
No, hot girl. Right here.

16:46.917 --> 16:49.542
Oh, so,
what do you have in mind?

16:49.542 --> 16:52.333
First fight,
first makeup sex.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.500
Sounds good to me.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.333
But I have to
go somewhere right now.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.125
Can we have makeup sex
when I'm done?

16:59.125 --> 17:00.834
Yeah. Where do you
have to go?

17:00.834 --> 17:03.959
I don't want to lie to you,
but I don't want you
to freak out.

17:03.959 --> 17:06.625
I called Marjorie.
I just want to talk to her.

17:06.625 --> 17:11.000
- Why?
- We're just...
we're having coffee today.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.500
I just want to see her
so I can apologize
for everything.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.500
If I stopped your wedding,
I'd do the same.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.417
- Comforting.
- You know what I mean.

17:18.417 --> 17:21.625
You picked a fight
with me so you can
have coffee with Marjorie

17:21.625 --> 17:23.917
- without feeling guilty.
- Of course not.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.083
- Well, guess what? Now you can.
- Bridget, come on.

17:27.083 --> 17:31.667
I'm just gonna go run
some red lights and talk
on my cell phone real loud.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.667
You have fun with Marjorie.

17:34.917 --> 17:37.125
[tires screech]

17:42.917 --> 17:44.834
[Marjorie] Brian.

17:44.834 --> 17:46.375
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.834
- You look great.
- You too.

17:50.834 --> 17:55.125
- Large americano, right?
- Yeah.

17:55.125 --> 17:59.583
So... what's new?
Are you back for good?

17:59.583 --> 18:03.041
I think so. I got offered
a position at Cedars.

18:03.041 --> 18:06.125
And I found a cute place
for rent up Beachwood Canyon.

18:06.125 --> 18:09.250
Beachwood,
that's a great place to buy.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.375
Oh, that's right.

18:11.375 --> 18:16.083
Deena told me you're some
hotshot real estate agent.
You and your girlfriend?

18:16.083 --> 18:19.959
Yeah, my girlfriend. We'll see
how much longer that lasts.

18:19.959 --> 18:22.709
- You wanna talk about it?
- It seems inappropriate.

18:22.709 --> 18:25.583
I didn't want to meet
so we could talk
about my problems.

18:25.583 --> 18:30.583
Well, we used to talk about it,
you know, all the time, before.

18:30.583 --> 18:32.583
Before I ruined everything.

18:33.750 --> 18:36.375
- I think I did that.
- No.

18:36.375 --> 18:40.083
I think every day how I wish
I could've kept my mouth shut.

18:40.083 --> 18:44.458
Stopping your wedding?
I was so selfish
and completely out of line.

18:44.458 --> 18:49.500
The reason you left Adam,
left LA, left...
your life was because of me.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.959
I'm just...

18:53.500 --> 18:54.792
...so sorry.

18:54.792 --> 18:58.125
Brian, leaving the church
that day, leaving LA,

18:58.125 --> 19:00.083
that was my decision.

19:00.083 --> 19:04.625
Whatever we did wrong,
whatever feelings
were there between us,

19:04.625 --> 19:08.125
I think they were there
because I was afraid
of getting married.

19:08.125 --> 19:10.417
I felt cornered, I ran.

19:10.417 --> 19:15.834
I wish that I would
have gone through with it
and know what I wanted.

19:15.834 --> 19:20.000
Then I'd be
married to Adam...

19:20.000 --> 19:25.375
...and I could be sitting here
with you talking about your
girlfriend troubles.

19:25.375 --> 19:29.166
I miss that, you know?
I miss being your friend.

19:30.959 --> 19:35.458
It's not... troubles, really.
It's kind of good, actually.

19:35.458 --> 19:40.458
We just got in a fight
before I came over here,
because I...

19:40.458 --> 19:44.917
[sighs] I started listing
her annoying qualities.

19:46.959 --> 19:48.667
That's not
always a good idea.

19:48.667 --> 19:51.125
Yeah, then she listed
my annoying qualities,

19:51.125 --> 19:54.458
and I told her I was
meeting you to talk
and then next thing I know,

19:54.458 --> 19:58.333
- she just took off.
- Six weeks, huh?

19:58.333 --> 20:03.125
- Apparently, this is what I do.
- So don't do it anymore,
you know?

20:03.125 --> 20:06.500
Maybe the six-week rule
doesn't even exist.

20:06.500 --> 20:10.041
If you really like this girl,
don't do what you did with me.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.875
Don't wait
until it's too late.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.041
I'm glad you're back.

20:20.208 --> 20:21.875
Me too.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.875
Here.

20:27.875 --> 20:30.041
No, I thought
I would just sit with her...

20:30.041 --> 20:31.875
You need sleep.

20:31.875 --> 20:34.208
Yeah, but I also need...

20:35.709 --> 20:39.041
You know, I have a vat
of Chunky Monkey in the freezer.

20:39.041 --> 20:40.709
I don't eat monkey.

20:41.875 --> 20:44.709
Well, we could just talk.

20:45.709 --> 20:48.542
I talk to baby.
Not to mama.

20:53.917 --> 20:56.250
You know, this just
isn't working out.

21:01.750 --> 21:05.583
Hey, you're home.
I've been keeping dinner warm.
Spaghetti carbonara.

21:05.583 --> 21:07.750
Thanks.
I already ate with Jimmy.

21:07.750 --> 21:10.709
Um, you don't
want anything at all?

21:10.709 --> 21:12.917
No, thanks.

21:14.625 --> 21:16.166
Is something the matter?

21:16.166 --> 21:18.500
I don't think
I can represent you, Heather.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.417
What do you mean? Why not?

21:20.417 --> 21:24.375
Well, I had a meeting
with Schmitty and his lawyer.

21:24.375 --> 21:28.083
He showed me all
the receipts and the pictures
of you and him together.

21:29.125 --> 21:32.125
- So?
- So it's obvious what this is.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.709
He bought you stuff,
he took care of you
in exchange for... for what?

21:35.709 --> 21:37.750
I'm guessing more
than lap dances.

21:37.750 --> 21:40.208
- Adam, he was a client.
- I have clients too.

21:40.208 --> 21:43.458
I don't buy them presents
or take them
for all-night sessions

21:43.458 --> 21:45.000
in the eternity room.

21:46.333 --> 21:49.125
What you're doing,
it's so textbook,
it's ridiculous.

21:49.125 --> 21:52.083
You're upset about Marjorie
so you're picking a fight.

21:52.083 --> 21:54.834
So in addition to being
a stripper and chiropractor,

21:54.834 --> 21:56.125
you're a therapist too.

21:56.125 --> 21:58.959
Sorry I'm not a squeaky-clean
doctor like Marjorie.

21:58.959 --> 22:02.250
- Leave Marjorie out of this.
- Why? You obviously can't.

22:02.250 --> 22:04.959
I don't understand
why you have her
on this pedestal

22:04.959 --> 22:09.291
after the way she treated you.
I'm the one who married you,
not her.

22:09.291 --> 22:12.291
- I'm the one
who's being honest.
- Well, then be honest.

22:12.291 --> 22:15.166
And tell me the truth.
Did you sleep with him or not?

22:16.583 --> 22:20.625
Does it even matter?
Would you even believe
anything I said?

22:22.500 --> 22:24.667
[phone rings]

22:28.375 --> 22:31.542
- Hey.
- I've been doing some research
on the Internet

22:31.542 --> 22:33.542
about this
cochlear thing.

22:33.542 --> 22:36.458
And a lot of deaf people
are against it.

22:36.458 --> 22:40.125
You know that?
If deaf people are against it,
that says something.

22:40.125 --> 22:43.500
It just might.
I'm here at the hospital,
actually. I could ask.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.834
- Is Carrie all right?
- Carrie is fine.

22:45.834 --> 22:49.125
- I left you a message.
- I'm not at work.
What's the message?

22:49.125 --> 22:52.500
I'm here with Marjorie.
She got us in to meet
with a surgeon.

22:52.500 --> 22:55.208
Wait. Are you making
decisions without me?

22:55.208 --> 22:58.041
- We haven't decided anything.
- We? You and Marjorie?

22:58.041 --> 23:02.291
Dave, listen, please don't
get mad. I left you a message,

23:02.291 --> 23:04.667
I had an opportunity, I took it.

23:04.667 --> 23:07.834
Nobody's gonna be deciding
anything without you,
I promise.

23:07.834 --> 23:09.709
[door opens]

23:09.709 --> 23:11.750
[man] Sorry
to keep you waiting.

23:11.750 --> 23:13.750
Dr. Baron.
Thank you for seeing us.

23:13.750 --> 23:17.166
- Dave, I have to go now, OK?
- No, you don't gotta go.
Deena! Deena!

23:17.166 --> 23:18.917
[phone beeps off]

23:18.917 --> 23:21.333
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

23:27.208 --> 23:30.166
- [knocking]
- Come in.

23:32.709 --> 23:33.875
[Adam clears throat]

23:33.875 --> 23:36.208
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:37.583 --> 23:41.208
Uh... I don't
have an appointment.

23:42.875 --> 23:44.458
That, and I'm not six.

23:44.458 --> 23:47.583
That's OK.
What're you doing here?

23:47.583 --> 23:51.375
Not that I mind
that you're here.
I'm glad you're here. I just...

23:51.375 --> 23:52.917
Please, stop me.

23:52.917 --> 23:56.125
Yeah. I just thought
we could get this whole

23:56.125 --> 23:59.458
seeing-each-other-for-the-first
-time thing over with.

23:59.458 --> 24:03.250
Technically,
it's the second time.
The first time was other night.

24:04.583 --> 24:08.917
Right. But you left
before I could say anything.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.583
What did you want to say?

24:12.583 --> 24:16.208
I just wanted
to say that I'm fine.

24:16.208 --> 24:19.125
You know, that I'm happy.
I've moved on.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.458
- I heard.
- What's what supposed to mean?

24:21.458 --> 24:24.667
I talked to Deena.
She said that you're married.

24:24.667 --> 24:27.000
Pretty much
the definition of "moved on."

24:27.000 --> 24:28.375
You have
a problem with that?

24:28.375 --> 24:33.959
We were supposed to spend
the rest of our lives together,

24:33.959 --> 24:37.875
and then you go off a month
later and marry some other girl.

24:39.959 --> 24:43.792
It's like, well,
if this one doesn't work,
you just plug in this one?

24:44.542 --> 24:46.333
No, it wasn't like that.

24:46.333 --> 24:49.667
I was gone for three months,
and you fell in love with
somebody else.

24:49.667 --> 24:51.959
You're in no position
to give me grief.

24:51.959 --> 24:54.625
I'm not trying
to give you grief. Who is she?

24:54.625 --> 24:58.250
She's a girl that I met
the night of our bachelor party.

24:58.250 --> 25:01.792
- The night before our wedding?
- The night you went to Brian's.

25:01.792 --> 25:05.583
We had the rehearsal dinner
then the guys took you
to that strip club.

25:11.792 --> 25:15.041
That's where you met her?
You married a stripper?

25:15.041 --> 25:20.000

This is my daughter's health
we're talking about.

a neutral doctor.

take your side over my side!

Marjorie was for you and me.

It's because I want to, you
know, move things forward.

to move in.

Six weeks. We've known
each other for six weeks.
