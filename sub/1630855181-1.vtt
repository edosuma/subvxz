00:26.529 --> 00:27.972
You gotta keep it steady.

00:28.022 --> 00:29.088
I know. - You don't know.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.498
Now listen, you're gonna hold it steady

00:30.540 --> 00:31.331
right there, all right.

00:31.373 --> 00:32.560
Listen to me. - Yes.

00:32.610 --> 00:33.401
All right? - I'm listening.

00:33.443 --> 00:34.668
I don't want to tell you twice.

00:34.710 --> 00:36.291
I'm always listening.

00:39.690 --> 00:40.840
Keep it steady, all right?

00:40.890 --> 00:42.580
I am keeping it steady.

00:42.630 --> 00:44.027
Nice and steady.

00:49.915 --> 00:51.532
Goddamnit.

00:55.350 --> 00:56.148
All right, come on,

00:56.190 --> 00:57.610
get it up there again, all right?

00:57.660 --> 00:59.134
Brian, you're shaking.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.686
What, you scared the can's gonna get you?

01:00.728 --> 01:02.678
You know what, shut your trap, Irene.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.597
God, I ain't scared of no can.

01:11.957 --> 01:13.713
Brian, you gotta pull back slow.

01:14.910 --> 01:15.903
I pulled it back.

01:17.070 --> 01:19.030
I had just told you to shut your trap.

01:19.080 --> 01:19.913
It's my turn.

01:24.540 --> 01:25.373
Yes ma'am.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.353
Keep it steady.

01:39.505 --> 01:40.500
You missed it.

01:41.467 --> 01:42.634
No I didn't.

01:55.948 --> 01:57.940
Hey, you guys're supposed to be family.

01:57.990 --> 01:59.040
Start acting like it.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.283
She were-

02:02.333 --> 02:03.408
What?

02:03.458 --> 02:04.458
Teasing you?

02:05.398 --> 02:06.408
Just 'cause she treat you like a baby

02:06.450 --> 02:08.710
doesn't mean you act like one.

02:08.760 --> 02:10.248
Irene, you need to
start treating your brother

02:10.290 --> 02:11.813
with some respect.

02:14.970 --> 02:15.790
Come on, Brian.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.240
We gotta go clear that tree.

02:22.980 --> 02:24.003
Did you start it?

02:25.967 --> 02:26.867
'Course I did.

02:47.490 --> 02:48.323
Ma?

02:49.260 --> 02:50.226
Ma?

02:52.170 --> 02:53.693
There's a man coming up the road.

02:56.220 --> 02:57.053
Who is he, Ma?

02:57.990 --> 02:58.823
I don't know.

03:08.370 --> 03:09.203
Howdy.

03:10.230 --> 03:11.193
Howdy, mister.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.093
Name's Jonathan.

03:16.350 --> 03:17.463
Jonathan Redmond.

03:19.380 --> 03:21.910
What brings you up this way, Mr. Redmond?

03:21.960 --> 03:24.280
Well, I'm a surveyor
for the Pacific Company

03:24.330 --> 03:27.482
and we're looking to maybe
have a line come through here.

03:27.532 --> 03:29.560
I don't want no train
coming through here.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.563
Irene, be friendly.

03:33.330 --> 03:37.833
Well the company might be
looking to take out an easement.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.715
I was hoping I could
maybe take a look around.

03:41.765 --> 03:43.995
I think you better talk
to my husband about that.

03:44.045 --> 03:45.273
He's just on up the way.

03:49.590 --> 03:51.573
Irene, show him to your Pa.

03:53.940 --> 03:54.773
My pleasure.

03:55.860 --> 03:56.693
Come on.

03:58.500 --> 03:59.853
I see you got revolver.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.430
I do.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.723
Is it for protection?

04:04.920 --> 04:05.753
It is.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.210
So you see a lot of bandits
out while you're surveying?

04:10.260 --> 04:11.770
Not yet.

04:11.820 --> 04:13.210
That's disappointing.

04:13.260 --> 04:15.280
I'd like to see a bandit.

04:15.330 --> 04:16.570
And why is that?

04:16.620 --> 04:18.340
So I could kill one.

04:18.390 --> 04:19.368
I'd like to kill my father,

04:19.410 --> 04:21.610
but he's out in Reno right now.

04:21.660 --> 04:23.610
Ain't you taking me to him right now?

04:24.630 --> 04:25.413
No, that's my Pa.

04:25.463 --> 04:26.508
He's my Ma's second husband.

04:26.550 --> 04:28.328
My father, he tried to
kill me and my brother,

04:28.370 --> 04:29.208
so in the middle of the night,

04:29.250 --> 04:30.790
we left for Tulsa.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.490
One day I'm gonna kill my father.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.200
And why are you saying this?

04:35.250 --> 04:37.780
I'm saying I got no
bones about killing nobody,

04:37.830 --> 04:38.838
and we came a long way out here

04:38.880 --> 04:39.828
to get away from all that trouble,

04:39.870 --> 04:41.590
and trains bring trouble.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.977
That's all I'm saying.

04:43.860 --> 04:46.413
So do you always make
threats to people who come by?

04:47.820 --> 04:49.720
Only people worth making threats to.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.900
I'll take it as a compliment.

04:52.950 --> 04:54.280
I don't like your tone, mister.

04:54.330 --> 04:55.985
I find it awfully disrespectful.

04:56.035 --> 04:58.548
I shot a rabbit just this
morning straight through the eye.

04:59.850 --> 05:03.333
Have to say, miss,
that's real impressive.

05:04.350 --> 05:05.183
It is.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.563
Your sister's got a fire in her.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.000
Sometimes she thinks
pretty highly of herself.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.123
Yeah.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.783
Maybe you should think
a little higher of yourself.

05:26.730 --> 05:28.017
Sure.

05:31.710 --> 05:32.673
It's a nice pile.

05:33.607 --> 05:34.827
"Nice pile"?

05:35.820 --> 05:38.920
Yeah, it's nice.

05:38.970 --> 05:39.803
Nice pile.

05:43.980 --> 05:45.280
Hey, Pa.

05:45.330 --> 05:46.908
There's a man coming up
here to drive an iron bullet

05:46.950 --> 05:49.480
right through our slice of heaven on earth.

05:49.530 --> 05:50.363
Howdy.

05:51.510 --> 05:52.343
Howdy.

05:56.040 --> 05:56.873
Thanks, Irene.

05:58.080 --> 05:58.980
Thank you, miss.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.073
Sure.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.360
Jonathan Redmond.

06:04.410 --> 06:06.760
I'm a surveyor for the Pacific Company.

06:06.810 --> 06:08.950
I was hoping to have a look around,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.050
possibly looking to take out an easement.

06:12.570 --> 06:14.570
Well, then you can have a look around.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.650
I don't know if I'll grant you one.

06:18.690 --> 06:21.190
Might just have to
take one from you, then.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.443
Hell, you can try.

06:40.950 --> 06:41.823
Supper ready?

06:44.040 --> 06:44.873
Nearly.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.500
I'm gonna grab a little something.

06:47.550 --> 06:50.273
Gotta get that heifer in before
the bull comes in tomorrow.

06:53.894 --> 06:54.911
What?

06:57.993 --> 07:02.993
You really think we can
make a ranch out of this place?

07:03.060 --> 07:04.053
Of course I do.

07:06.090 --> 07:07.450
Well, once that bull comes in,

07:07.500 --> 07:08.883
we can start making babies.

07:11.070 --> 07:11.861
Well, in that case,

07:11.903 --> 07:13.098
we could've used couple more rooms

07:13.140 --> 07:15.290
instead of you spending money on that bull.

07:16.170 --> 07:18.633
I will build you eight more rooms.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.763
Three more floors.

07:22.830 --> 07:23.930
I got the money, Beth.

07:26.294 --> 07:27.627
Don't you worry.

07:34.890 --> 07:36.040
Where'd you learn that?

07:38.916 --> 07:40.015
You.

07:40.065 --> 07:40.898
Right.

07:43.367 --> 07:45.483
That's how you cut your
fingers off, too, right?

07:46.410 --> 07:47.243
Yeah.

07:52.770 --> 07:55.073
What, you don't like
eating with us or something?

07:56.340 --> 07:57.550
No.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.179
Just don't like eating with you.

08:16.740 --> 08:17.640
Is he mad at me?

08:18.540 --> 08:20.440
I don't know, why don't you ask him?

08:35.310 --> 08:37.117
Why you got that twine?

08:37.167 --> 08:38.223
Why do you care?

08:39.330 --> 08:41.253
Just asking. Trying to be friendly.

08:44.310 --> 08:47.193
Well, it's for trying things.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.263
Things that use twine.

08:50.370 --> 08:54.970
You can get stuff outta trees.

08:55.020 --> 08:58.030
You can fix things.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.440
You can fix a bucket handle

09:00.330 --> 09:03.550
and you can make shoelaces.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.850
You can, I don't know, tie things together.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.223
Stitch up stuff.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.060
You know, you never know
when you could use twine.

09:15.002 --> 09:16.114
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard

09:16.156 --> 09:18.906
and I've known you my whole life.

09:19.970 --> 09:22.137
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.023
Howdy.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.060
Evening, mister.

10:01.110 --> 10:02.620
Find what you were looking for?

10:02.670 --> 10:06.190
Sure did. It's beautiful
land you got here.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.073
Thank you.

10:08.491 --> 10:11.680
You know, it's getting a
little later than I expected

10:11.730 --> 10:13.720
and seven miles back to town.

10:13.770 --> 10:16.550
I don't think I'll make it
back before dark, so...

10:18.960 --> 10:21.160
Certainly you're welcome to the land.

10:21.210 --> 10:24.070
Ain't got much room left inside for you.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.253
Ain't got much left inside for myself.

10:27.450 --> 10:28.883
Much obliged, miss.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.290
Have you had supper yet?

10:32.340 --> 10:33.460
Oh no, no, no, no.

10:33.510 --> 10:36.760
That'd be imposing myself far too much.

10:36.810 --> 10:37.930
Please.

10:37.980 --> 10:41.170
Be nice to have some
company around here for once.

10:41.220 --> 10:42.161
If I'm being honest,

10:42.211 --> 10:45.363
I wouldn't mind some company myself.

11:07.410 --> 11:09.280
Irene, could you put the lamp up?

11:22.783 --> 11:24.903
I think you've forgot to fill it.

11:24.953 --> 11:28.536
I think you forgot to tell me to fill it.

11:47.782 --> 11:49.278
I apologize for the state of our home.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.418
It's not quite finished yet.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.257
We just been here the one summer.

11:52.307 --> 11:53.853
It's real lovely, miss.

11:57.206 --> 11:58.206
All right.

12:00.810 --> 12:02.530
Bless us our heavenly father.

12:02.580 --> 12:05.320
Thank you for the bounty
which we are about to partake.

12:05.370 --> 12:06.453
Amen. - Amen.

12:11.820 --> 12:13.698
Sure nice to having on have
an unfamiliar face round here.

12:13.740 --> 12:16.270
We don't get too many house guests.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.020
Pleased to have the hospitality.

12:19.641 --> 12:21.203
So where are you from, mister?

12:23.550 --> 12:24.880
I'm from Cleveland.

12:24.930 --> 12:27.090
I've heard bad things about Cleveland.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.840
What have you heard?

12:28.890 --> 12:30.910
Not to trust a man from Cleveland.

12:30.960 --> 12:31.751
Where'd you hear that?

12:31.793 --> 12:33.280
Oh, I heard it from me.

12:33.330 --> 12:35.200
Irene, apologize.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.310
I don't like him, Ma.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.510
Apologize.

12:37.560 --> 12:38.598
You better apologize.

12:38.640 --> 12:39.798
I ain't apologizing to a man

12:39.840 --> 12:41.118
looking to steal our home from us.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.850
You apologize right now.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.800
I'm just speaking what I'm thinking.

12:46.320 --> 12:49.203
Well, go on and speak
it to yourself outside, then.

12:51.261 --> 12:52.094
Fine.

12:58.997 --> 13:01.590
I'll be speaking a whole
lot of things out there.

13:34.947 --> 13:37.197
You like guns?

13:40.627 --> 13:41.517
I do.

13:41.567 --> 13:44.103
Do you have any other guns around here?

13:45.360 --> 13:46.410
No, just the rifle.

13:51.660 --> 13:56.660
First the target and down the barrel.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.263
Straighten up.

14:01.804 --> 14:02.971
Now that's it.

14:04.320 --> 14:05.620
You can shoot if you want.

14:07.239 --> 14:08.049
Thanks.

14:12.277 --> 14:13.793
Where'd you get it?

14:13.843 --> 14:15.731
I bought it.

14:15.781 --> 14:18.014
I know that.

14:18.064 --> 14:20.913
There's a chance I was wrong about you.

14:20.963 --> 14:21.746
No, you weren't.

14:27.228 --> 14:29.930
Now I'm gonna need you to be nice and quiet

14:29.980 --> 14:30.963
and drop that gun.

14:32.820 --> 14:33.653
Goddamnit!

14:36.034 --> 14:38.980
Now I'm gonna need you
to turn around nice and slow

14:39.030 --> 14:40.794
and walk back to the house.

14:44.014 --> 14:45.587
My Pa's coming.

14:45.637 --> 14:49.503
Why don't we go back
inside and wait for him then?

14:52.290 --> 14:53.123
Turn around.

14:54.090 --> 14:55.083
Come on, get!

14:56.040 --> 14:56.873
I said get!

14:58.967 --> 15:00.972
I said I didn't like him.

15:01.022 --> 15:02.827
Irene!

15:05.516 --> 15:07.707
What do you want?

15:07.757 --> 15:09.315
I want you

15:09.365 --> 15:10.798
to sit down.

15:21.215 --> 15:24.453
Now boy, reach on
over for your mama's hand.

15:27.390 --> 15:28.323
Don't let go.

15:29.430 --> 15:31.030
Keep each other going, you hear?

15:32.640 --> 15:36.033
Now I need girly, get up on the table.

15:39.148 --> 15:44.148
Sit on your hands.

15:46.077 --> 15:46.910
Wow.

15:48.042 --> 15:49.125
Look at that.

15:50.572 --> 15:52.489
It's a family portrait.

16:20.899 --> 16:23.403
Hope it ain't too much
of a breach of hospitality,

16:25.077 --> 16:26.157
but I invited some friends.

16:30.178 --> 16:31.469
Come in!

17:08.111 --> 17:10.750
Now that we got that settled,

17:10.800 --> 17:12.400
might be time for introductions.

17:14.430 --> 17:17.373
My name is Lewis Clark.

17:18.630 --> 17:20.103
And yes, that's my real name.

17:21.840 --> 17:26.493
That over there, that's Peter the Apostle,

17:27.510 --> 17:29.883
on account he is so damn loyal,

17:31.200 --> 17:35.253
and he do love sending them
poor souls to them Pearly Gates,

17:37.474 --> 17:39.576
or wherever they might end up.

17:41.490 --> 17:43.353
That skunky bastard by the door,

17:45.180 --> 17:47.620
that's Enoch McCready,

17:47.670 --> 17:50.040
also known as Bad Luck Nucky.

17:50.090 --> 17:52.720
It's 'cause if you meet me,

17:52.770 --> 17:54.670
you've had some bad luck.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.393
That and he don't ever
win at cards, right, boys?

18:02.147 --> 18:04.780
And I do believe you've
already been acquainted

18:04.830 --> 18:05.980
with our newest member,

18:07.020 --> 18:09.280
Jonathan "Red Bone" Redmond.

18:09.330 --> 18:11.808
His name supposed to
scare us or something?

18:20.310 --> 18:23.613
And of course, outside
we got the big man, Big Ben.

18:25.301 --> 18:26.673
He ain't much of a talker.

18:28.290 --> 18:29.840
Or a listener, for that matter.

18:33.540 --> 18:34.683
And that right there,

18:38.610 --> 18:41.733
that's Henry "The Headhunter" Goodfellow.

18:44.310 --> 18:48.933
But you might know him as Robert Smith.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.193
Or Pa.

19:02.443 --> 19:04.990
I guess you thought you
were just gonna run off

19:06.030 --> 19:08.080
and live all nice like.

19:08.130 --> 19:09.400
Disgusting.

19:09.450 --> 19:12.243
Johnny, keep outta this.

19:15.210 --> 19:16.660
This here is a family matter.

19:18.600 --> 19:19.443
Let them go.

19:20.490 --> 19:22.353
That's not up to me, I'm afraid.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.260
And I do believe it was
you who once told me

19:27.480 --> 19:30.280
that there's no negotiating with a man

19:30.330 --> 19:32.043
who's got nothing to lose.

19:33.930 --> 19:35.480
And from what I can see, Henry,

19:37.349 --> 19:39.813
you got a whole hell
of a lot to lose right now.

19:45.424 --> 19:48.033
Nucky, say hello to Henry.

19:57.138 --> 19:58.221
I hate you.

19:59.453 --> 20:01.223
I thought you'd've run off by now.

20:07.446 --> 20:12.029
I seem to remember there
being a whole lot more of you.

20:13.819 --> 20:14.819
Oh, Henry.

20:19.211 --> 20:20.044
Oh, Henry.

20:22.798 --> 20:25.965
Oh, I wish it me that got to kill you.

20:39.328 --> 20:40.995
What do we got here?

20:44.848 --> 20:46.819
Hey, don't, hey.

21:02.247 --> 21:04.367
So where is it?

21:04.417 --> 21:05.417
It's gone.

21:06.345 --> 21:07.178
I Spent it.

21:10.827 --> 21:13.627
You come all this way to
kill a mother and her children?

21:15.390 --> 21:17.573
We came all this way
to collect on our debt.

21:19.628 --> 21:22.810
The only debts I got are
between me and the Lord.

21:22.860 --> 21:26.223
Don't worry, you'll be
meeting him soon enough.

21:28.590 --> 21:30.303
Then go ahead and kill me.

21:31.980 --> 21:33.123
Leave them be.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.640
They had nothing to do with this.

21:37.350 --> 21:38.183
True.

21:40.140 --> 21:42.483
No, not yet.

21:45.990 --> 21:47.443
This whole family here,

21:49.466 --> 21:51.299
they die 'fore you do.

21:54.450 --> 21:55.700
And they won't even know why.

21:59.184 --> 22:04.184
You wanna tell 'em why, do you?

22:06.780 --> 22:08.333
You wanna tell 'em what you done.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.833
People that you killed,

22:15.660 --> 22:18.723
family you betrayed.

22:22.020 --> 22:24.153
Stop lying to them and yourself.

22:25.809 --> 22:28.540
Tell 'em who the man
is they been living with.

22:28.590 --> 22:30.093
I ain't that man anymore.

22:32.100 --> 22:32.933
Hmm.

22:38.839 --> 22:40.506
I suppose you ain't.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.173
I pity you.

22:45.491 --> 22:47.290
There ain't nothing sadder than a man

22:47.340 --> 22:48.893
who don't know who he is.

22:53.940 --> 22:58.023
In this great world
bequeathed to us by the divine,

23:00.810 --> 23:02.763
we all have our place,

23:05.820 --> 23:09.693
our purpose designed by the Lord.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.170
That's what makes us man.

23:14.550 --> 23:18.513
A man who don't know
who he is ain't a man at all.

23:21.390 --> 23:22.223
You see, Henry,

23:23.520 --> 23:24.547
we know who we are.

23:26.880 --> 23:30.370
We are the wolves who prey on the sheep

23:30.420 --> 23:32.718
to keep them from straying from the herd.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.422
We have our purpose.

23:47.730 --> 23:48.563
You?

23:50.576 --> 23:51.409
You, Henry?

23:55.470 --> 23:56.973
You ain't nothing anymore.

23:59.010 --> 24:03.633
You're nothing but a wolf eating grass.

24:08.550 --> 24:09.393
It's outside.

24:11.566 --> 24:13.192
By an oak tree.

24:17.520 --> 24:20.574
You have become even more of a coward.

24:24.330 --> 24:28.000
Johnny pick this piece of shit up.

24:45.255 --> 24:48.028
You keep an eye on these fine folk.

25:12.712 --> 25:14.388
Hey there, Big Ben.

25:17.707 --> 25:19.803
There's a shovel around the house.

25:22.483 --> 25:23.274
You get the shovel.

25:23.316 --> 25:25.263
You get the shovel, Nucky.

26:00.451 --> 26:02.043
You know, your Pa over there.

26:03.720 --> 26:07.360
Oh, he's a real mean son of a bitch.

26:07.410 --> 26:08.810
Did you know that about him?

26:14.192 --> 26:16.109
He shot his best friend

26:17.790 --> 26:21.003
right in the back.

26:24.600 --> 26:27.093
He betrayed the only family he ever knew.

26:31.950 --> 26:33.800
Funny how life is circular like that.

26:37.260 --> 26:38.433
Heard all about you.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.160
Yeah.

26:42.210 --> 26:44.133
Second to the big man himself.

26:46.620 --> 26:47.670
You could say that.

26:53.910 --> 26:56.410
Hey, which one of you two are older?

26:56.460 --> 26:57.293
It's you.

26:58.950 --> 26:59.783
No?

27:01.380 --> 27:04.090
Oh, wait, no, you must be twins.

27:04.140 --> 27:06.370
I bet you're happy you're
not one of them twins

27:06.420 --> 27:08.420
that are stuck together
at the hip like that.

27:19.020 --> 27:22.120
It's been too long, ain't it?

27:22.170 --> 27:23.003
Yeah.

27:24.660 --> 27:26.832
You are looking a stretch older.

27:30.120 --> 27:33.411
You were always the one
with the pretty face, Henry.

27:35.714 --> 27:36.547
Nucky!

27:37.506 --> 27:38.423
Right here.

27:42.271 --> 27:43.054
Hey!

27:46.764 --> 27:47.707
Go on.

27:47.757 --> 27:48.693
Get digging.

27:50.050 --> 27:50.883
Fine.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.250
I'm gonna kill you.

28:03.150 --> 28:04.402
Sorry, what was that?

28:06.387 --> 28:07.627
I'm gonna kill you.

28:09.350 --> 28:12.994
Ah.

28:13.044 --> 28:16.211
You could, you could just let us go.

28:17.973 --> 28:19.150
We don't know you

28:19.200 --> 28:20.553
and we have nothing to give you.

28:34.321 --> 28:36.573
The thing is, darling,

28:37.860 --> 28:39.737
I've been doing this a long time, see?

28:40.950 --> 28:44.523
And everyone is always
begging for their life.

28:46.860 --> 28:48.243
And I don't like it.

28:49.339 --> 28:50.172
I don't.

28:51.348 --> 28:55.330
In fact, in my experience,

28:55.380 --> 28:59.453
it only serves to speed up the process.

29:32.850 --> 29:35.553
Looks like Bad Luck Nucky's
having bad luck digging.

29:36.780 --> 29:38.350
I'm digging.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.120
And this is important.

29:40.170 --> 29:43.120
And some might say this
is the most essential part

29:43.170 --> 29:44.226
of this whole thing.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.400
What are you doing?

29:47.430 --> 29:48.250
I'm watching.

29:48.300 --> 29:50.290
Making sure you're doing a good job.

29:50.340 --> 29:51.490
I'm doing a fine job.

29:52.424 --> 29:53.403
Ain't so sure.

29:54.630 --> 29:56.200
What do you say, Lewis?

29:56.250 --> 29:57.800
Is he doing a fine job digging?

30:00.060 --> 30:01.773
I'd say it's adequate.

30:02.677 --> 30:03.597
"Adequate."

30:04.980 --> 30:07.503
I'd say you're doing an
adequate job of breathing.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.777
Do you even know what
adequate means, Nucky?

30:57.988 --> 30:59.147
Come on!

30:59.197 --> 31:00.803
Damn!

31:03.146 --> 31:04.229
Oh, oh God!

31:10.815 --> 31:12.246
Son of a bitch!

31:16.120 --> 31:18.037
The hell are you doing?

31:19.813 --> 31:21.137
Go get him!

31:21.187 --> 31:22.560
Son of a bitch.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.593
Henry never
could stay beat for long.

31:41.910 --> 31:42.950
No, he couldn't.

31:48.060 --> 31:50.129
Thought you were the same.

32:01.849 --> 32:02.682
Hey!

32:05.110 --> 32:07.693
I'll be damned.

32:08.877 --> 32:10.833
Get this thing outta my damn foot.

32:17.296 --> 32:19.630
Okay, nice and easy now, okay?

32:19.680 --> 32:21.182
Just one, two-

32:21.232 --> 32:24.063
Oh, shit!

32:24.113 --> 32:25.609
Sweet jumping-

32:25.659 --> 32:27.113
Come on.

32:27.996 --> 32:29.388
What the hell happened here, Peter?

32:29.430 --> 32:31.660
What the hell does it look like?

32:31.710 --> 32:32.613
I don't know.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.350
Give me the girl. I'm gonna kill her.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.580
No!

32:39.630 --> 32:42.100
She stabbed me in my damn foot!

32:42.150 --> 32:43.330
So?

32:43.380 --> 32:44.800
So I want you to shoot her!

32:44.850 --> 32:45.633
No!

32:45.683 --> 32:46.516
Do it!

32:47.369 --> 32:48.774
No! No!

32:48.824 --> 32:51.433
No!

32:56.304 --> 33:01.304
You happy now?

33:01.513 --> 33:03.003
Nucky, you shot the wrong kid.

33:03.053 --> 33:04.533
He said the girl Nucky.

33:06.913 --> 33:07.704
Well, I'm sorry, damnit!

33:07.746 --> 33:10.008
No, it's fine, just go ahead
and shoot that bitch, too!

33:10.050 --> 33:10.883
Come on! - No!

33:12.900 --> 33:15.276
We ain't shooting nobody right now.

33:38.398 --> 33:40.065
Nucky.

33:40.115 --> 33:41.169
Careful.

33:47.250 --> 33:48.378
Peter, I just want you to know

33:48.420 --> 33:50.140
that I checked under everything

33:50.190 --> 33:51.820
and I didn't find any more little girls

33:51.870 --> 33:53.266
that might jump out at you.

33:59.287 --> 34:00.376
Bring me the boy.

34:08.150 --> 34:09.483
No! No!

34:13.790 --> 34:17.290
Move again and I'll kill you.

34:25.868 --> 34:28.565
Ma, it's alright, we'll get him back

34:28.615 --> 34:29.908
I swear.

34:29.958 --> 34:31.165
I'm sorry.

34:49.070 --> 34:49.903
Lewis!

34:57.217 --> 34:58.050
Lewis!

35:00.020 --> 35:01.623
It ain't gotta be like this!

35:03.925 --> 35:05.725
It's far too late for that, Henry.

35:06.690 --> 35:08.340
I still consider you a brother.

35:10.980 --> 35:12.363
I know that sounds strange,

35:13.680 --> 35:14.523
but it's true.

35:16.110 --> 35:17.433
I couldn't do it anymore.

35:21.570 --> 35:26.073
Ain't you ever wanted
a life away from all this?

35:29.010 --> 35:30.663
No more death, no more killing.

35:32.490 --> 35:36.393
Anyway, you can take me.

35:38.220 --> 35:43.197
I'll show you where the money
is and then you go, all right?

35:47.826 --> 35:49.353
It ain't my decision, Henry.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.433
If it were, would you go?

35:56.646 --> 35:57.968
I do believe so.

36:10.770 --> 36:11.763
Evenin', son.

36:13.050 --> 36:14.680
Don't you worry.

36:14.730 --> 36:16.570
Your Pa plays this right,

36:16.620 --> 36:19.518
you'll be digging his
grave instead of lying in it.

36:25.842 --> 36:27.175
Is he a good Pa?

36:28.680 --> 36:29.913
Do anything for you?

36:34.350 --> 36:35.993
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:37.556 --> 36:38.965
I taught him that.

36:46.276 --> 36:47.590
All right.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.540
Maybe you should say something to him.

36:53.997 --> 36:54.830
Pa!

36:55.890 --> 36:58.203
Don't think that's quite loud enough.

36:59.279 --> 37:00.112
Pa!

37:17.520 --> 37:19.427
It's good to see you Henry.

37:21.687 --> 37:22.863
You too, brother.

37:55.590 --> 37:57.963
Sounds like your Pa ran into a friend.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.602
Stay with the boy, Nucky.

38:15.047 --> 38:15.853
C'mon!

38:45.676 --> 38:46.509
Hmm.

38:56.060 --> 38:57.143
Can you read?

39:07.348 --> 39:09.593
I like books.

39:27.578 --> 39:28.495
Read to me.

40:12.793 --> 40:17.793
I was born in the year
1632 in the city of York

40:19.443 --> 40:21.093
of a good family,

40:22.350 --> 40:23.418
though not of that country.

40:23.460 --> 40:26.200
Hmm, no, not of that country.

40:28.290 --> 40:29.740
I didn't say for you to stop!

40:31.727 --> 40:34.540
Though not of that country.

40:34.590 --> 40:37.990
My father being a foreigner of Bremen.

40:38.040 --> 40:40.977
Damn it, it's pronounced "bree-man"!

40:45.517 --> 40:50.043
"Bree-man," who settled first at Hull.

40:51.780 --> 40:55.240
He got a good estate by merchandise.

41:17.375 --> 41:20.018
You ever play horseshoes?

41:20.068 --> 41:21.400
What?

41:21.450 --> 41:23.950
I said did you ever play
horseshoe with your Pa?

41:26.280 --> 41:27.113
No.

41:28.065 --> 41:29.440
Huh.

41:29.490 --> 41:31.140
He was always good at horseshoes.

41:33.279 --> 41:36.146
I figured he would've showed you.

41:50.797 --> 41:52.021
...English shoes and stockings,

41:52.063 --> 41:54.663
which were things I greatly wanted,

41:56.046 --> 41:59.960
but had none on my feet for many years.

42:00.010 --> 42:03.790
I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now,

42:03.840 --> 42:06.569
which I took off the
feet of two drowned men

42:06.619 --> 42:08.379
whom I saw in the wreck,
very welcome to me,

42:10.370 --> 42:13.713
and I found two pair
more in one of the chests.

42:16.547 --> 42:19.655
But they were not like our English shoes.

42:25.561 --> 42:27.311
...which were very welcome to me,

42:28.502 --> 42:29.839
but they were not like our-

42:29.889 --> 42:30.722
Drop it.

42:31.991 --> 42:32.824
Now!

43:36.676 --> 43:38.093
Where's my son?

43:40.009 --> 43:41.990
They still got him.

43:42.040 --> 43:43.790
Don't you worry, he's safe for now.

43:45.151 --> 43:46.984
You don't know that.

43:48.030 --> 43:49.143
Go get him right now.

43:51.480 --> 43:53.250
No, we wait for 'em to come back.

43:55.247 --> 43:57.414
Why are you saying that?

44:00.633 --> 44:02.800
'Cause I know these men.

44:04.721 --> 44:06.554
How do you know 'em?

44:10.440 --> 44:12.120
I used to be one of 'em.

44:16.900 --> 44:19.863
I guess you already figured that out.

44:25.676 --> 44:28.267
Look I-

44:28.317 --> 44:31.013
I lived I-

44:31.063 --> 44:32.583
I grew up in an orphanage.

44:32.633 --> 44:35.643
That much is true.

44:40.770 --> 44:43.011
And one day, uh...

44:44.250 --> 44:47.050
Ezekiel came by and said
he saw something in me

44:47.100 --> 44:48.666
and asked me if I wanted to go with him,

44:48.708 --> 44:51.543
and of course I said yeah.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.233
He had a whole gang of us out on the farm.

44:59.123 --> 45:01.683
One day we just started robbing, killing.

45:05.586 --> 45:10.147
I ain't gonna get into all that.

45:10.197 --> 45:11.733
And after we left the farm,

45:12.690 --> 45:13.870
we started running,

45:16.210 --> 45:17.224
and after years of running,

45:17.266 --> 45:21.040
I just figured I'd

45:23.550 --> 45:25.300
settle down and made myself a life.

45:28.610 --> 45:32.343
He never told me where
the earnings were, but...

45:34.285 --> 45:35.702
I knew.

45:38.170 --> 45:39.620
One day I just up and took it

45:43.546 --> 45:45.577
and I set myself up real nice.

45:46.441 --> 45:47.441
Now, that's,

45:50.730 --> 45:51.987
that's when I met you.

45:54.567 --> 45:56.050
And I couldn't go spending it all

45:56.100 --> 45:58.343
'cause that would've just created a stir,

45:59.318 --> 46:00.235
and then...

46:03.510 --> 46:04.773
They found me anyway.

46:07.050 --> 46:08.450
And that's why they're here,

46:09.960 --> 46:12.912
for their money and my blood.

46:19.001 --> 46:20.334
I'm sorry, Beth.

46:23.910 --> 46:25.683
I had no business getting with you.

46:31.800 --> 46:33.813
You're one real bastard.

46:38.790 --> 46:40.221
Where's the money?

46:40.271 --> 46:43.480
Beth, I-

46:43.530 --> 46:44.313
After all this,

46:44.363 --> 46:46.710
you ain't gonna tell me
where the money is, huh?

46:49.500 --> 46:51.200
What do you think you're gonna do?

46:52.283 --> 46:55.173
Are you gonna go and
you gonna beat all them?

46:56.040 --> 46:57.213
Chase 'em down?

46:59.359 --> 47:00.679
What's your plan?

47:00.729 --> 47:02.468
Come on, Beth.

47:02.518 --> 47:03.309
You know, I'd give 'em the money.

47:03.351 --> 47:06.783
I just, I'm just a man.

47:08.730 --> 47:10.027
My son is out there

47:10.077 --> 47:11.568
and they want what you took from them.

47:11.610 --> 47:13.780
You gonna give it to 'em, you hear me?

47:13.830 --> 47:15.070
Yeah, all right.

47:15.120 --> 47:15.911
Where's the money?

47:15.953 --> 47:18.250
It's under the floorboards, all right?

47:18.300 --> 47:20.493
Right there under the house.

47:21.390 --> 47:22.440
It's not nailed down.

47:25.735 --> 47:26.568
Damn you.

47:28.110 --> 47:28.943
Irene.

47:30.262 --> 47:31.762
Go on and get it.

49:39.726 --> 49:40.559
Ezekiel!

49:42.657 --> 49:44.043
You tell Nucky,

49:45.496 --> 49:47.688
if that two-bit huckster of a
dog, they take another step,

49:47.730 --> 49:50.380
I'm gonna blow your
head off and theirs, too.

49:50.430 --> 49:51.850
You want your boy back?

49:51.900 --> 49:53.620
Take another step,

49:53.670 --> 49:54.940
make another move I don't like,

49:54.990 --> 49:57.340
it better be their hands
in the sky praying to God,

49:57.390 --> 49:59.945
because that's the last chance they'll get.

50:03.990 --> 50:06.180
I'm gonna approach the house,

50:06.230 --> 50:07.313
hands to God.

50:09.013 --> 50:11.583
I don't need you going
and taking my head off.

50:21.270 --> 50:23.703
Got three bags of your sin in here.

50:24.920 --> 50:27.010
You send my boy back
to me and you can have it.

50:27.060 --> 50:28.683
I hope I'm incorrect,

50:28.733 --> 50:30.123
but I believe you have the body

50:30.173 --> 50:32.585
of dear brother Peter in there.

50:32.635 --> 50:34.685
Need to be giving him a Christian burial.

50:36.330 --> 50:37.743
Come in here and get him.

50:38.910 --> 50:41.613
You bring him, and the money, too.

50:42.463 --> 50:45.370
I ain't stepping in that house.

50:57.322 --> 50:58.448
Keep your hands up, boys.

50:58.498 --> 50:59.998
Yeah, keep 'em up.

52:35.607 --> 52:37.898
I got you, I got you!

52:37.948 --> 52:39.875
Come on now.

52:48.483 --> 52:51.050
It is good to see you, Henry.

52:52.611 --> 52:54.528
You could've written.

52:57.840 --> 52:58.673
Go!

53:04.320 --> 53:05.570
Much obliged.

53:12.120 --> 53:12.953
Oh.

53:53.737 --> 53:55.320
He was a bad man.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.473
What happened tonight,

54:07.325 --> 54:08.733
that was on him.

54:10.530 --> 54:13.233
That was his sin coming back, kids.

54:18.570 --> 54:20.268
If it had been one of y'all instead of him,

54:20.310 --> 54:22.023
I'd done killed him myself.

54:30.060 --> 54:33.050
He's done bad things with very bad people.

54:34.342 --> 54:39.153
He doomed us, since the
day that we got married.

54:53.460 --> 54:56.530
My brothers, let us attend to you

54:56.580 --> 54:58.563
as you begin your eternal descent.

55:00.720 --> 55:03.693
May the gates of hell open at your whisper.

55:05.100 --> 55:08.380
May we, the forsaken and lost,

55:08.430 --> 55:09.670
mourn not your life,

55:09.720 --> 55:13.413
but your deeds and your deeds unfinished.

55:18.300 --> 55:19.500
Now, tomorrow morning,

55:21.720 --> 55:23.643
before that crew bring in that bull,

55:25.920 --> 55:27.123
we gonna bury him,

55:28.890 --> 55:30.140
and we gonna do it right.

55:35.882 --> 55:37.632
And then we're gonna,

55:39.253 --> 55:40.953
we're gonna catch a ride into town

55:44.430 --> 55:46.923
and a stage coach to Tulsa.

55:53.247 --> 55:57.167
We're gonna, we're gonna
have to start a whole new life

55:58.561 --> 56:00.144
again by ourselves.

56:08.700 --> 56:10.203
Wherever you want.

56:12.750 --> 56:14.590
You wanna stay here
while they're out there?

56:14.640 --> 56:16.593
I wanna keep you safe.

56:17.790 --> 56:19.510
I gotta to keep you safe.

56:19.560 --> 56:20.718
Yeah Pa was the one that did that,

56:20.760 --> 56:22.200
and now he's dead.

56:28.290 --> 56:30.730
May I spill my blood for you

56:31.650 --> 56:34.816
as yours has been shed for me.

56:42.390 --> 56:46.083
As you have bled, so shall I.

56:53.010 --> 56:55.053
Ashes to ashes.

56:59.580 --> 57:03.280
My brothers, we came here for one purpose,

57:03.330 --> 57:05.380
and that was to retrieve our honor

57:05.430 --> 57:09.010
from the bloodstained
hands of he who took it.

57:09.060 --> 57:13.720
And yet two of our
brothers lie dead before us,

57:13.770 --> 57:17.230
their lives unduly taken by Judas himself,

57:17.280 --> 57:19.810
the man who left the
only family he ever knew

57:19.860 --> 57:22.683
just so he could steal one for himself.

57:25.889 --> 57:30.640
That family, those children, that woman,

57:30.690 --> 57:32.133
they just over that hill.

57:33.990 --> 57:35.673
We came for respect.

57:36.960 --> 57:39.663
We stay for retribution.

57:46.950 --> 57:48.123
I'm gonna kill 'em.

57:51.090 --> 57:52.953
Get that outta your head right now.

57:53.910 --> 57:54.860
Don't say that.

57:58.170 --> 57:59.620
They come in here,

57:59.670 --> 58:01.330
take us captive,

58:01.380 --> 58:04.023
kill Pa and kidnap my brother,

58:04.980 --> 58:07.960
and you just wanna let that pass by?

58:08.010 --> 58:10.240
You think you're gonna
hunt down a gang of outlaws?

58:10.290 --> 58:12.409
You gonna kill 'em one by one?

58:12.459 --> 58:13.292
Yes.

58:14.772 --> 58:17.192
I didn't raise murderers.

58:17.242 --> 58:18.159
Too late.

58:20.867 --> 58:22.360
I gotta protect you.

58:22.410 --> 58:25.173
Oh, you've done a hell of a job at that.

58:30.479 --> 58:32.380
I think it's best we
all just get some sleep.

58:32.430 --> 58:34.688
I ain't sleeping tonight, Ma.

58:34.738 --> 58:36.550
They gone, Irene.

58:36.600 --> 58:37.570
We don't know that.

58:37.620 --> 58:38.633
We should go.

58:38.683 --> 58:41.725
I say we stayin', we stayin'.

58:43.710 --> 58:46.013
If you think they gone,
why are you scared, then?

59:40.552 --> 59:42.190
What are they doing?

59:42.240 --> 59:43.590
I think it's a tea party.

59:52.571 --> 59:54.260
They ain't here.

59:56.040 --> 59:56.873
They're gone.

59:58.710 --> 01:00:01.210
How long did it take
you to figure that one out?

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:10.470
Where do you wanna go?

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.733
You wanna go to Chicago?

01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:15.190
You always were saying you wanna go

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.840
somewhere something's happening.

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.397
I want go to Robinson Crusoe's island.

01:00:24.739 --> 01:00:26.650
There ain't no one out there.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.840
Just no one to bug us.

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:31.113
Just us and goats.

01:00:31.984 --> 01:00:34.313
That sounds real nice.

01:00:34.363 --> 01:00:36.723
Ain't they got cannibals on that island?

01:00:46.586 --> 01:00:47.605
You find 'em?

01:00:47.655 --> 01:00:49.353
Someone's got a limp.

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:58.053
Stay back and see if
Henry left anything else.

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.940
He was talking to you.

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.967
No he didn't.

01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:07.850
You stay. I ain't staying.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:10.133
Flip a coin?

01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.983
Fine.

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:21.413
Heads.

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.565
Bad luck.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.208
Ma, they got our tracks.

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:36.572
We gotta run.

01:01:36.622 --> 01:01:38.320
No, we can't run.

01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:40.300
Brian can't run.

01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:41.201
If they're gonna find us,

01:01:41.243 --> 01:01:43.388
they're gonna find us sooner or later.

01:01:43.438 --> 01:01:44.250
Then we kill 'em.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.362
No, no.

01:01:45.412 --> 01:01:46.778
Let them pass by.

01:01:46.828 --> 01:01:48.474
You should just go.

01:01:48.524 --> 01:01:49.600
No, no.

01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:51.867
We ain't gonna leave you, Brian.

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:54.053
Brian, Brian, what are you doing?

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.583
If we can get back to the house, right?

01:01:57.633 --> 01:01:59.410
It's the only place they checked.

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.530
It's the only place they know we ain't.

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:06.577
Yeah, all right.

01:02:11.387 --> 01:02:14.887
You never know when you need some twine.

01:02:24.753 --> 01:02:25.575
Let's go!

01:02:25.625 --> 01:02:26.570
Come on!

01:02:58.907 --> 01:03:00.498
Wait here.

01:03:00.548 --> 01:03:02.122
Wait here.

01:03:02.172 --> 01:03:03.080
Okay.

01:03:35.893 --> 01:03:37.596
All right. Come on.

01:03:37.646 --> 01:03:38.660
Come on.

01:03:55.933 --> 01:03:57.406
We're safe now.

01:03:57.456 --> 01:03:59.438
Don't lie to me, Ma.

01:03:59.488 --> 01:04:00.902
They ain't here.

01:04:00.952 --> 01:04:02.347
And if we left when we said we would,

01:04:02.389 --> 01:04:04.722
we wouldn't be here, either.

01:04:08.056 --> 01:04:09.389
You should've,

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:13.359
you should've just left me.

01:04:13.409 --> 01:04:14.836
Quit feeling
sorry for yourself Brian.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.033
Are you dead?

01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:29.543
No.

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:32.140
Come on out, then.

01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:34.300
And if I even imagine I
hear you reaching for a gun,

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:35.600
you sure gonna hear mine.

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.030
They're coming.

01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:57.453
They're coming for me.

01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:02.860
