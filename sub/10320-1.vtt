Hey, Tommy.

00:45.731 --> 00:48.066
You didn't see Grandpa drop this bread,
did you?

00:49.818 --> 00:51.570
Good. I'll just feed it to Joey.

00:53.447 --> 00:54.907
- Morning, Daniel.
- Morning.

Hey, Tommy. Let's show your gramps
the gift your Uncle J got you...

Hey, Jess.

01:17.596 --> 01:22.100
[impersonates Bullwinkle] When will you
give up this Elvis thing? It's childish.

01:24.770 --> 01:28.857

Bullwinkle every time. He knows karate.

Good morning!

- Man, oh, man. I'm exhausted.
- Oh, yeah? From last night?

01:55.300 --> 01:58.595
No, from walking up and down
all those stairs to the attic.

every day for seven years?

crashing here this weekend,

the same Bugs Bunny pajamas.

02:24.162 --> 02:25.163
Weird.

02:25.246 --> 02:29.209

- Oh!

02:49.730 --> 02:52.232
Okay, I have 15 minutes to eat breakfast

02:52.315 --> 02:54.109
and then I have to go open the pet clinic.

02:54.192 --> 02:56.653
Dad, remember,
you're taking the boys to school.

02:56.737 --> 02:59.031

But my name's first.

Well, Michelle sends her love,

Me. That's me. That was me.

04:18.777 --> 04:20.570

- Hi, Steph.

04:20.654 --> 04:21.654
[Steph] Hello.

04:21.863 --> 04:23.448
How is Las Vegas treating you?

04:23.531 --> 04:27.202
Steph, I am doing ten shows a week
at The Venetian.

04:27.285 --> 04:30.831
And I don't like to brag,
but I'm kicking Carrot Top's butt.

04:32.332 --> 04:36.795
Here they are, still in college after
six years, Nicky and Alex Katsopolis!

04:40.966 --> 04:43.677
We only need to pass
two more classes to graduate.

04:43.885 --> 04:45.971
So what's that, another three years?

04:46.554 --> 04:47.722
Dad, you're hilarious.

04:47.806 --> 04:49.224
[winces]

04:49.307 --> 04:52.602
The best part about college
is that we got hella good at surfing.

04:54.855 --> 04:57.273
Eighty grand, so they can do this.

04:58.274 --> 05:00.652
Time for breakfast!
I have to get to work.

05:00.861 --> 05:03.738
I've got a bride and groom
whose dog swallowed their wedding ring.

05:05.573 --> 05:08.368
That's what you get
for making a beagle your best man.

05:09.244 --> 05:12.122
Before we eat, I have something
very important to say, okay?

05:12.998 --> 05:14.666
Damn, we all still look good!

05:21.464 --> 05:22.966
Especially me.

05:23.633 --> 05:27.762
You guys teased me about the hair cream
and all the moisturizer I used to use.

05:27.846 --> 05:30.431
My face is like a baby's butt
and I got a beautiful mane.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.517
<i>Hola, </i> Tanneritos!

05:39.607 --> 05:41.985
Whoa! I'm having an acid flashback.

05:42.819 --> 05:44.487
But I never dropped acid.

05:44.571 --> 05:48.867
I did take an antacid once.
I must be having an antacid flashback.

05:49.701 --> 05:53.205
Kimmy, why are you here, and why
did I never fix the lock on that door?

05:54.622 --> 05:57.709
Dad, be nice. Kimmy's helping me
throw your going-away party.

05:57.918 --> 05:59.335
I'm an event planner now.

05:59.419 --> 06:02.797
When you're ready to party,
do it Gibbler Style.

06:03.006 --> 06:06.634
I don't know if I want to do anything
Gibbler Style.

06:08.053 --> 06:11.848
Well, the party tonight will be brilliant,
since DJ Tanner will be spinning.

06:12.057 --> 06:12.974
I am?

06:13.183 --> 06:14.726
Not you, D.J. Tanner...

06:14.809 --> 06:16.270
Me, DJ Tanner.

06:16.352 --> 06:18.396
That's my official DJ name.

06:20.356 --> 06:22.192
You stole my name?

06:22.859 --> 06:24.945
Why couldn't you call yourself
DJ Stephanie?

06:25.153 --> 06:27.405
Because there's already a DJ Stephanie.

06:27.614 --> 06:29.741
There's already a D.J. Tanner!

06:31.451 --> 06:32.535

Action Jackson! Hello! Oh. Here, boys.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.587
I've brought you the hottest dance hits
from the clubs of London.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.089
For you and for you.

06:44.714 --> 06:48.551
I'm sure there are no inappropriate
references to drugs, sex, or violence

06:48.635 --> 06:49.636
on those songs.

06:49.719 --> 06:51.596
And I'll be taking those right back.

06:53.181 --> 06:56.059
Relax, Mom.
I already know all the bad words.

06:56.143 --> 06:58.686
Darn, booger, and Donald Trump.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.441
Becky, could you please pass the wa'er.

07:03.650 --> 07:05.068

the past year without your help.

07:16.037 --> 07:17.956
We really appreciate you taking us in.

07:18.165 --> 07:20.792
Aw, honey. I've loved having you here.

07:21.001 --> 07:24.338
Oh, and I think I found the cutest
little place for the boys and me.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.507
You know, it just hit me
what selling this house really means.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.218
We're saying goodbye to our family home.

07:31.678 --> 07:35.515
I feel like this is my house, too.
I was here more than my own home.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.894
It makes me want to just kick off my shoes
and put my feet up.

07:40.103 --> 07:41.146
[Tommy grizzles]

07:41.896 --> 07:42.939

07:56.703 --> 07:59.998

08:00.081 --> 08:02.125
Oh, I'm American again!

08:04.460 --> 08:06.963
Once again, my feet save the day.

08:07.172 --> 08:09.632
Yeah, but they smell like Trump.

09:24.082 --> 09:26.460
What do you think? Too much?

09:26.667 --> 09:28.586
Oh, not enough.

09:31.506 --> 09:32.757
Isn't this crazy?

09:32.840 --> 09:35.009
I wound up living back in my old bedroom.

09:35.218 --> 09:36.719
I moved in here when I was five.

09:36.928 --> 09:39.055
Yeah, and then I moved in.

09:39.139 --> 09:41.266
Gosh. And now here we are again.

09:41.349 --> 09:42.558
It's the circle of life.

09:43.351 --> 09:45.312
Oh, look! And there's Simba.

How's it hanging?

09:56.114 --> 09:58.032
Hey, hey, my eyes are up here. Yes.

but this Dairy Queen is closed, okay?

10:03.871 --> 10:07.041
Yes. Here. Just go right to Mommy.
There you go.

10:09.252 --> 10:10.753
So,

10:10.837 --> 10:12.130
how are you holding up?

10:13.047 --> 10:16.801
Well, you know, I have three boys
who count on me for everything,

10:17.718 --> 10:19.929
so I can't worry about
the things I can't change.

10:21.222 --> 10:24.725
My husband died doing what he loved...
fighting fires and helping people.

10:24.809 --> 10:25.935
He'd want me to be strong.

10:27.937 --> 10:30.606
I wish you'd spend time with your nephews.
They adore you.

10:30.815 --> 10:33.943
Oh, same here, but you know me.

10:34.027 --> 10:36.363

10:36.446 --> 10:40.116
I love to travel,

You have no idea how much fun it is
being DJ Tanner.

10:45.121 --> 10:47.832
Don't you ever want to have some kids
and settle down?

10:48.041 --> 10:51.545
It sounds boring. To me.

10:51.627 --> 10:53.254
But it's perfect for you.

I mean, you're an amazing mom,
just like you're an amazing big sister.

Well, not always.
Do you remember the day you moved in here?

11:03.639 --> 11:06.684
I put that rope across the room
to keep you out of my half.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.977
Yeah, you did.

11:08.186 --> 11:11.772
And the only way to get out was
by climbing up on the curtains, remember?

11:11.856 --> 11:13.816
I hopped on up on them, and I was like...

11:13.900 --> 11:15.068

Kimmy, your ex-husband is here!

14:03.944 --> 14:07.865
Uh-uh-uh.
Kimmy and I are temporarily separated.

14:07.948 --> 14:12.036
I admit, it does not look good,
but my goose is not officially cooked.

14:12.828 --> 14:18.459
Fernando, this is a going away party.
So please, go away.

14:19.753 --> 14:20.878
Kimberlina, <i>mi amor.</i>

14:20.961 --> 14:24.424
You are looking fine as wine
in the summertime.

14:25.633 --> 14:27.218
Fernando, give up.

14:27.427 --> 14:28.720
Never.

14:28.803 --> 14:30.137
I'm not ashamed to admit...

14:30.971 --> 14:35.893
My name is Fernando
Hernandez-Guerrero-Fernandez-Guerrero,

14:36.102 --> 14:38.646
and I am a Kimmy Gibbler-aholic.

14:40.815 --> 14:42.233
Kimmy Gibbler?

14:43.526 --> 14:47.113
My friend, I have seduced
the most beautiful women in the world.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.657
Yeah, some of them during our marriage.

14:51.951 --> 14:53.911
Yes, I made one mistake.

14:54.579 --> 14:56.289
Many, many times.

14:57.415 --> 15:00.585
But no one has the skills
of this enchantress.

15:01.377 --> 15:03.087
Kimmy Gibbler knows things.

15:03.170 --> 15:07.133
Long-lost secrets of the Kama Sutra
from deepest, darkest India.

15:09.719 --> 15:11.929
This Kimmy Gibbler?

15:14.056 --> 15:16.309
Yes, this Kimmy Gibbler.

15:16.517 --> 15:18.018
Goodbye, Fernando.

15:19.604 --> 15:20.647
<i>Adios.</i>

15:21.689 --> 15:22.690
For now.

15:23.483 --> 15:24.317
Ramona.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.401
<i>Adios, </i> Papa.

15:25.485 --> 15:26.653
Bye-bye.

15:27.862 --> 15:30.072
Everyone, this is my daughter Ramona.

15:30.281 --> 15:31.365
Hi, Ramona!

15:31.574 --> 15:33.159
Ramona, you know these people, right?

15:34.201 --> 15:35.202
I know these three.

15:35.411 --> 15:39.165
My mom calls them Dreamy,
Cleany, and Weenie.

15:41.501 --> 15:44.838
It's time to take it back to the
late '80s when this party got started!

15:44.920 --> 15:46.339
New Kids On The Block!

15:46.422 --> 15:48.132
[cheering]

15:50.092 --> 15:53.387
[Steph playing "You Got It (The Right
Stuff)" by New Kids on the Block]

16:07.568 --> 16:08.903
Wow!

16:18.329 --> 16:23.459
Hey, Tanners, Fullers, Gibblers,
Gladstone, Rippers, Katsopoli. Hi.

16:24.251 --> 16:25.419
Steve!

16:25.503 --> 16:26.629
Thanks for coming by.

16:26.838 --> 16:29.256
Oh, my God. Are you kidding? Free food!

16:30.216 --> 16:33.052
- So, how's Comet Junior Junior doing?
- She's doing great.

16:33.135 --> 16:36.639
She's about to go into labor. But I'm
the one putting on the pregnancy weight.

16:37.306 --> 16:38.516
I think you look great.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.267
So do you.

16:41.310 --> 16:43.688
Deej, I know you're not
ready to start something new,

16:43.771 --> 16:46.440
or restart something old,

16:46.649 --> 16:49.569
but I want you to know that
when you're ready, I'll be right here.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.488
Little weenie?

16:52.572 --> 16:54.949
Actually, I'll be right over there.
I love those.

16:55.157 --> 16:58.160
So, Uncle Jesse,
when did you get your first motorcycle?

16:58.369 --> 17:00.538
I was ten
when I first started riding a Harley.

17:00.747 --> 17:03.165
Ten? I'm 13 and I only have a dirt bike.

17:03.374 --> 17:07.086
Remember this was the '70s,
when nobody cared about kids getting hurt.

17:07.753 --> 17:09.964
Jackson, go talk to Ramona.

17:10.047 --> 17:12.633
Please don't make me.
Ramona's a pain in the butt.

17:12.842 --> 17:15.678
You can't possibly still be upset
about your sixth birthday.

17:15.887 --> 17:17.805
She ruined my cowboy party.

17:17.888 --> 17:19.056
She blew out my candles,

17:19.138 --> 17:22.393
she stole my wish,
which was for her to leave,

17:23.060 --> 17:26.772
and then when she did leave,
she rode away on the pony ride pony.

17:26.981 --> 17:30.025
She's half Gibbler.
She knows not what she does.

17:30.985 --> 17:32.528
Just say hi.

17:36.282 --> 17:38.325
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:42.538 --> 17:44.123
Put your phones away. Put them away.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.458
Talk.

17:45.541 --> 17:46.960
Just catch up.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.753
Look who's awake.

17:50.630 --> 17:52.506
There's my baby boy.

17:56.886 --> 17:58.554
Aunt Becky, you can give him back now.

17:58.763 --> 18:01.348
Well, live it up now
because the next thing you know,

18:01.432 --> 18:02.433
they turn into that.

18:02.976 --> 18:04.435
[high-pitched voices] Hi, Mom.

18:10.024 --> 18:14.570
Wow. I'm looking around the room
and realizing that after tonight,

18:14.654 --> 18:16.196
everyone is going to be gone.

18:16.948 --> 18:17.949
You're leaving.

18:18.992 --> 18:20.576
You're leaving.

18:20.785 --> 18:22.244
You're leaving.

18:22.328 --> 18:23.830
You already left.

18:24.872 --> 18:25.999
I hope you're leaving.

18:28.167 --> 18:30.795
So it's just going to be me and the boys.

18:31.921 --> 18:33.213
But we'll be fine.

18:33.297 --> 18:36.133
There's lots of single moms.
I can do this.

18:37.259 --> 18:40.554
I just want you all to know
I love you so much.

18:40.763 --> 18:42.598
- I love you.
- To family.

18:42.807 --> 18:43.891
To family!

18:44.976 --> 18:46.560
[high-pitched voices] To family.

18:47.728 --> 18:52.025
And now, it's time to force Jesse to sing
the song that we love and he hates.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.735
It was a hit in Japan in 1992

18:54.819 --> 18:57.446
and right now,
let's make it a hit in our living room.

18:57.530 --> 18:58.823
"Forever"!

18:59.032 --> 19:01.325
"Forever"! "Forever"!

19:01.534 --> 19:04.829
No, no, no, guys.
I've been singing "Forever" forever.

19:05.496 --> 19:07.540
I'll never sing "Forever"
as long as I live.

19:07.748 --> 19:10.417
- But sweetheart, it's our wedding song.
- Hit it, Rippers!

19:12.545 --> 19:14.714
This song goes out to my beautiful Becky.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.842
Thank you for 28 beautiful years.

19:18.051 --> 19:20.053
I will love you forever.

How did I do?

21:01.361 --> 21:04.490
29 seconds. You still have two
more garbage bags to break your record.

21:09.787 --> 21:10.913
Ready? Set?

21:11.122 --> 21:12.372
Hold on! Hold on!

21:13.624 --> 21:15.876
Your mom told Jackson
to take out the trash.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.003
He's using you.

21:17.211 --> 21:18.420
Um, no...

21:18.504 --> 21:22.883
I'm just giving my little brother a chance
to set the world record in trash takeout.

21:23.676 --> 21:26.053
Max, you don't have to do what he says.

21:26.261 --> 21:27.721
Yeah, I do.

21:27.805 --> 21:31.600
Jackson implanted
a tiny explosive in my brain...

21:33.435 --> 21:35.938
that he can detonate at any moment.

21:37.690 --> 21:40.317
Oh, please. He just stole that
from <i>Mission Impossible.</i>

21:40.526 --> 21:42.569
Max, Max, Max. Don't listen to her.

21:42.778 --> 21:44.363
Then do it.

21:44.446 --> 21:45.739
Blow his head up.

21:46.532 --> 21:47.741
Yeah.

21:47.825 --> 21:49.118
Blow my head up.

21:51.037 --> 21:53.664
Alright, fine. I made it up.

21:53.873 --> 21:55.208
How dare you!

21:58.585 --> 22:01.130
And you can start
making your own bed, too.

22:04.050 --> 22:08.137
Wow. Thanks, Ramona.
I'm so glad I only see you once a year.

22:08.345 --> 22:09.596
I'll time you.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.936
Steve, here are all the leftovers.

22:16.020 --> 22:17.563
Thank you.

22:17.771 --> 22:21.150
Oh, hey,
can I have those pudding cups, too?

22:21.234 --> 22:22.317
Those are for the kids.

22:22.526 --> 22:26.655
Oh. So I guess you're going to want
these Lunchables back, then?

22:29.449 --> 22:32.078
Hey... I had a good time tonight.

you and me would wind up together.

You know what I super regret? I should
have asked you to marry me at the prom.

22:52.265 --> 22:55.726
Oh... We were just kids.
We weren't ready for that.

22:55.809 --> 22:58.271
But as I recall,
you're the one that got married first.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.647
Yeah. That's my other big regret.

23:01.565 --> 23:03.943
I lost half my money and half my hair.

23:05.236 --> 23:08.739
But here we are now, right?
Both single.

- And still great friends.
- Yeah, just great single friends.

these Otter Pops are starting to melt.

Oh, awesome! I got my upgrade
for my flight to Brazil tomorrow.

23:35.015 --> 23:36.850
I can't believe you're leaving already.

23:37.059 --> 23:39.478
I know. I am booked solid
for the next few months.

23:39.561 --> 23:42.773
First I go to Ibiza and then Singapore
and then Cleveland.

23:42.982 --> 23:46.152
Wow, that's so cool.
I've always wanted to go to Cleveland.

23:48.070 --> 23:51.282
After Dad leaves,
this D.J. Tanner is booked solid, too.

23:51.490 --> 23:56.536
Carpool... me, laundry... me,
groceries... me, Mommy and me... me.

23:57.704 --> 23:59.332
It's all me.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.251
I've got the answer...
just never go to sleep.

24:10.634 --> 24:12.052
<i>Hola</i>, Mr. T.

24:13.637 --> 24:16.723
Kimmy, why don't you ever knock?
What if I was in my underwear?

24:17.432 --> 24:19.518
Nothing I haven't seen before.

24:21.061 --> 24:24.357
My second-story window
looked right into your bedroom.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.028
Did you ever get that mole checked out?

24:30.863 --> 24:31.864
Why are you back here?

24:32.072 --> 24:34.033
We, at Gibbler's Style, always follow-up

24:34.116 --> 24:37.036
to make sure our clients
are Gibbler satisfied.

24:37.995 --> 24:42.124
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I actually am Gibbler satisfied.

24:43.334 --> 24:45.002
Your cleaning crew was fantastic.

24:45.211 --> 24:50.757
And in some odd, sick, twisted way,
I may actually Gibbler miss you.

24:52.343 --> 24:54.887
You can say it. You love me.

24:55.846 --> 24:57.597
I love...

24:57.681 --> 24:58.849
that you said it for me.

25:00.226 --> 25:01.227
Come on. Bring it in.

25:01.435 --> 25:02.853
Really?

25:02.936 --> 25:05.898
I've been waiting 20 years
to hug the king of all huggers.

25:13.530 --> 25:15.282
Wow, that was really...

25:16.075 --> 25:17.492
anticlimactic.

25:18.577 --> 25:20.454
Hey, Tommy's not feeling well.

25:20.537 --> 25:22.539
Kimmy, can you go
warm up a bottle, please?

25:22.748 --> 25:24.166
No problemo.

25:24.833 --> 25:27.794
Mom, I thought this was
going to be a quick stop.

25:28.003 --> 25:30.464
- I need to help D.J.
- What am I supposed to do?

25:30.672 --> 25:32.674
You're a Gibbler.
Make yourself at home.

25:34.051 --> 25:38.555
Okay, I'll raid the fridge,
snoop around, try on some clothes.

25:38.764 --> 25:40.391
That's my girl.

25:41.267 --> 25:44.019
But don't use their toothbrush.
We're not animals.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.398
Tommy has an ear infection.

25:48.065 --> 25:50.401
I think I have some drops in the kitchen.

25:50.484 --> 25:52.278
- [doorbell rings]
- Don't worry, Deej. I'll get it.

25:54.405 --> 25:57.157
D.J., Comet Junior Junior needs your help.

25:57.366 --> 26:00.077
She's been in labor all night
but the puppies aren't coming.

26:00.160 --> 26:03.747
I'm so worried, I can't eat.
This has never happened before.

26:05.458 --> 26:10.170
Comet Junior Junior's having babies?
This is better than Shark Week!

26:11.964 --> 26:16.093
Okay. Kimmy, here.
I'll... I'll take Comet.

26:16.176 --> 26:20.389
Max, grab my medical bag and follow me.
Steve, get a bowl of water.

26:20.597 --> 26:23.600
Kimmy, can you please
put Tommy in his crib upstairs?

26:23.809 --> 26:26.645
And, Dad, I ran out of jobs,
so do whatever you want!

26:27.813 --> 26:31.942
D.J., can you deliver the puppies outside?
I'm showing the house on Wednesday.

26:33.235 --> 26:34.778
Smart move, Mr. T.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.405
Birthing can be messy.

26:36.489 --> 26:39.658
I had Ramona in a rental car
and lost my deposit.

26:48.501 --> 26:51.628
Comet's out of the woods.
And the first puppy's a boy.

26:53.130 --> 26:55.590
Can I keep one?
Mom said I could get a dog.

26:55.674 --> 26:57.717
Yeah, if it's okay with D.J.

26:57.926 --> 27:02.348
I said someday, honey. Not today.
I have too much on my plate right now.

27:02.556 --> 27:05.225
But he's Comet Junior Junior Junior.

27:06.643 --> 27:09.438
Come on, Mom. You promised.
Jackson, you were there.

27:09.646 --> 27:12.691
That's right. You promised
right after his goldfish died.

27:12.899 --> 27:15.235
And right before his toilet funeral.

27:17.196 --> 27:20.240
- Come on. Please, please!
- No. Max, no!

27:20.324 --> 27:22.576
Max, I said no dog, okay?

27:22.659 --> 27:25.538
You have no idea
how much work a puppy is.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.874
It's like having another baby,
except this one doesn't wear diapers!

27:28.957 --> 27:31.001
A puppy will poop and pee
all over the house,

27:31.084 --> 27:33.003
and the stains
are impossible to get out...

27:33.086 --> 27:38.342
Not for me! Grandpa taught me how to
remove even the most stubborn of stains.

27:40.177 --> 27:41.845
I love this kid.

27:42.804 --> 27:45.849
This is all going to fall on me.
I have enough to take care of.

27:46.433 --> 27:48.268
[Tommy crying over baby monitor]

27:48.894 --> 27:51.897
Oh! Oh, I forgot to give Tommy
his ear drops.

27:51.980 --> 27:55.025
- Deej, let me help.
- Yeah, I'll give you a hand, too.

27:55.234 --> 27:56.902
No, this is my responsibility.

27:58.529 --> 28:01.073
So that was a yes to the puppy?

28:02.199 --> 28:05.285
Come on, everybody. You're going
to miss your plane. Taxi's here.

28:05.369 --> 28:06.579
Oh, chicken.

28:09.915 --> 28:11.833
Thanks for your help, Jess.

28:13.252 --> 28:15.212
- Put them right here.
- Lovely.

28:16.963 --> 28:20.717
I found one of my missing shirts
from 1989.

28:21.385 --> 28:24.513
This baby never went out of style.

28:24.721 --> 28:26.056
Because it was never in style.

28:26.265 --> 28:30.060
Oh, Jess. Cut it out.

28:34.314 --> 28:38.151
Where are the ear drops?
Where are...? Here they are.

28:39.027 --> 28:40.695
Hey, Deej, are you okay?

28:40.904 --> 28:44.617
Yes! I'm fine.
Why does everyone keep asking me that?

28:44.699 --> 28:48.036
- I have to get to Tommy.
- Honey, I can take care of the baby.

28:48.245 --> 28:52.040
I'd love to take care of the baby.
Jess, can we please have another baby?

28:52.124 --> 28:54.126
Beck, you know that ship has sailed.

28:54.334 --> 28:56.128
In fact, it sunk.

28:56.211 --> 28:57.963
All seamen lost.

29:00.466 --> 29:01.883
Right.

[D.J. over monitor] <i>It's okay, Tommy.</i>
<i>Mommy's here.</i>

29:11.268 --> 29:14.605
[cries] I'm sorry,
but I'm having a tough day, too.

29:15.897 --> 29:18.024
It's just, everyone's leaving...

29:19.318 --> 29:22.362
and for the first time,
we're going to be all on our own.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.241
[D.J. over monitor] <i>Oh, Tommy.</i>

29:26.450 --> 29:27.826
[sniffs]

29:27.909 --> 29:30.078
Tommy, I know.

29:30.829 --> 29:33.790
I just don't know
if I can deal with all of this.

29:38.587 --> 29:42.174
I just hope I can give you
the beautiful life you deserve.

29:52.726 --> 29:54.353
Tommy's going to be alright.

29:55.020 --> 29:58.398
- I thought you guys had to get going.
- No, we talked.

29:58.607 --> 30:01.318
And I'm not going to take that job.

30:01.401 --> 30:02.861
I'm staying here to help you.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.904
- Dad, that's crazy.
- [Danny] No.

30:05.113 --> 30:07.866
You're way more important to me
than a talk show,

30:08.074 --> 30:09.868
even a nationally syndicated one.

30:11.578 --> 30:15.165
And if Danny's not doing the show,
then neither am I, so I can help, too.

30:15.374 --> 30:19.961
And I can commute to Vegas in my Bonanza
and move right back into the basement.

30:20.879 --> 30:23.256
Sounds like you guys got this covered.
I'll be in LA.

30:23.465 --> 30:25.175
- Yeah...
- Not so fast.

30:25.384 --> 30:27.386
Oh, no, no, no. There is no way...

30:27.594 --> 30:30.013
Guys, please, sit down.
We're having a little talk.

30:30.639 --> 30:32.224
- What?
- Sit.

30:36.936 --> 30:41.024
You're all moving to LA,
and you're going back to Vegas.

30:41.233 --> 30:44.570
You guys did your share for us.
Now it's time for me to step up.

30:44.778 --> 30:46.279
- Steph...
- No.

30:46.363 --> 30:49.408
I am clearing my schedule
and moving in with my sister.

30:49.616 --> 30:50.950
I'm perfectly capable...

30:51.034 --> 30:53.662
You are entirely too stubborn
to ask anyone for help.

30:54.663 --> 30:57.416
You do everything for everyone else.

30:57.499 --> 30:58.709
But you need me right now.

31:00.335 --> 31:01.628
And you need me.

31:02.837 --> 31:04.130
So I'm moving in, too!

31:08.843 --> 31:10.721
Kimmy, you do not need to do this.

31:10.804 --> 31:14.099
Yes, I agree with D.J.
You do not need to do this.

31:14.891 --> 31:16.560
Yes, I do.

31:16.643 --> 31:19.605
Deej, you've been there for me
my whole life.

31:19.688 --> 31:22.148
I was the kid no one wanted
to hang out with,

31:22.232 --> 31:24.735
for reasons I'll never understand.

31:25.652 --> 31:27.738
We understand.

31:29.322 --> 31:30.949
But D.J., you didn't care.

31:31.032 --> 31:32.867
You always had my back.

31:32.951 --> 31:34.703
So now I've got yours.

31:36.162 --> 31:41.251
The truth is, I've been so scared
about how to make this work by myself.

31:41.334 --> 31:43.712
- I love you guys so much.
- We love you, too.

31:45.798 --> 31:47.966
I'm going to have to rent a bigger house.

31:48.174 --> 31:51.094
No, you're not.
I'm taking the house off the market.

31:51.177 --> 31:52.971
You stay here as long as you want.

31:53.179 --> 31:54.222
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:54.431 --> 31:56.182
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

31:56.391 --> 31:58.977
Are you sure?
You know how much this house is worth now?

32:00.895 --> 32:02.606
Oh, my God. This is awesome!

32:02.815 --> 32:07.360
You guys aren't going to believe this,
but I've always wanted to live here!

Deej, Ramona is not going be happy about
changing schools and leaving her friends,

32:18.872 --> 32:20.165
so please not a word to her.

Great news. Grandpa's letting us stay here
and Aunt Stephanie is moving in!

Awesome!

That means Aunt Steph
can help with the puppy! Right, Mom?

Okay, Max. You can have a puppy.
