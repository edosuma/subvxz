00:17.633 --> 00:19.567
Mabel.

00:23.572 --> 00:26.166
Yoo! Does anybody
want a beer?

00:31.179 --> 00:32.441
Hollis, check this out.

00:34.616 --> 00:36.140
You asshole!

00:38.487 --> 00:41.251
Hey, who busted the lock?
I got the keys right here.

00:41.323 --> 00:43.257
- Howard did.
- Uh-oh!

00:43.325 --> 00:45.520
- Howard.
- Harry Warden did it.

00:47.129 --> 00:49.393
And whoever parked
the red Volkswagen out front...

00:49.464 --> 00:51.898
I want it parked out back
with the others, like I said.

00:51.967 --> 00:54.299
I don't want Newby
snoopin' around here.

00:54.369 --> 00:56.303
Let me show you.

01:08.817 --> 01:10.546
That's pretty crude!

01:12.888 --> 01:15.379
Quiet. You're making
too much noise!

01:15.457 --> 01:17.925
- Hey, whoa, Mr. Party.
- Whoa.

01:19.161 --> 01:21.561
Johnny's got a catch there.
Hey,Johnny, where you going?

01:21.630 --> 01:23.757
Sylvia's gonna get it!

01:34.443 --> 01:36.434
Talk to you
in a minute, okay?

01:42.050 --> 01:45.486
So, you're looking pretty good,
baby face. What's the occasion?

01:45.554 --> 01:47.488
I figure it will get
Newby off my back.

01:47.556 --> 01:50.548
Besides, I wanna get out
of this town pretty quick.

01:50.625 --> 01:52.559
You know, I think
he really likes you.

01:57.232 --> 01:59.223
I've got the munchies.

02:15.017 --> 02:17.076
Hot dogs.

02:21.156 --> 02:22.748
Here, Spot.

02:23.525 --> 02:25.220
No! Who is that?

02:45.280 --> 02:47.441
I got a feeling
about the mine, Ben.

02:47.516 --> 02:49.711
I'll check back
with you, all right?

02:49.785 --> 02:53.915
Make sure you call me on the radio
if anything comes up.

02:53.989 --> 02:55.354
Will do.

02:58.260 --> 03:00.319
What the hell is that?

03:09.938 --> 03:11.235
Go on!

03:13.542 --> 03:15.009
Go on!

03:18.447 --> 03:20.438
Go on!
Get the hell outta here!

03:40.402 --> 03:42.427
"You didn't stop the party."

03:45.240 --> 03:47.401
Stop the party?

03:47.476 --> 03:49.467
What damn party?

04:08.463 --> 04:11.261
Stavisky, you couldn't clean
that table with a broom!

04:11.333 --> 04:14.359
Aw, Hollis,
you don't even know--

04:14.436 --> 04:17.529
Hey, guys, check this out.
Check this out. Gretchen.

04:17.606 --> 04:19.836
What are you doing, man?

04:19.908 --> 04:22.877
- Eww!
- Oh, wow!

04:22.944 --> 04:25.811
The first time I tried
to snort Coke, and I almost drown.

04:25.881 --> 04:27.940
Next time,
try harder.

04:29.317 --> 04:31.512
- Axel, please.
- Oh, come on.

04:31.586 --> 04:33.019
Axel, please, don't.

04:33.088 --> 04:35.579
- What's the matter, baby?
- Axel, please, don't.

04:35.657 --> 04:39.718
- Oh, come on!
- Will you please stop it?

04:39.794 --> 04:41.728
Guess you better
back off there, Axel.

04:43.031 --> 04:45.124
You back
the fuck off, man.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.465
We were doing just fine until you
decided to come crawlin' home.

04:48.537 --> 04:50.732
In case you haven't noticed,
things are changed around here.

04:50.805 --> 04:52.204
She don't want nothin'
to do with you.

04:52.274 --> 04:56.438
Do you mind?
I have my own mouth, thank you.

04:56.511 --> 04:58.604
Then why don't you use it?
Tell him.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.614
Tell me what?

05:02.450 --> 05:04.748
She wants to come back
with me.

05:04.819 --> 05:08.380
- Bullshit, man!
- Why don't you both just back off?

05:09.558 --> 05:11.492
You're acting like
a couple of jerks.

05:13.862 --> 05:16.057
Oh, well, you just
love it, don't you?

05:18.233 --> 05:19.825
That's it.

05:24.306 --> 05:26.274
You son of a bitch!

05:26.341 --> 05:28.400
Hollis, do something!

05:30.512 --> 05:32.810
Hollis! Let go!

05:32.881 --> 05:34.610
- Damn it!
- Let go!

05:34.683 --> 05:37.447
Shit! You guys,
knock it off!

05:41.122 --> 05:43.716
- T.J., are you outta shape.
- Get outta here!

05:58.106 --> 06:00.097
Sure you're okay?

06:12.887 --> 06:15.515
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for that to happen.

06:22.030 --> 06:24.430
T.J., please stop it.

06:24.499 --> 06:27.627
I just don't care anymore.

06:27.702 --> 06:29.636
Just leave me alone.

06:32.774 --> 06:34.173
Come on.

06:37.746 --> 06:41.079
Okay, listen. I showed you how to
do it with the right nostril, right?

06:41.149 --> 06:44.016
You take the straw, you put it
up the neck-- the left nostril...

06:44.085 --> 06:46.019
and you snort it.

06:46.087 --> 06:48.317
Oh! Come on!
Loosen it up!

06:48.390 --> 06:51.382
Let's have fun. We're at
a Valentine's party, for God's sake!

06:51.459 --> 06:53.654
I'm getting
a little punchy myself.

07:43.345 --> 07:45.939
How do you
get those down?

07:46.014 --> 07:48.574
- Pull the rope.
-Just pull it?

07:50.185 --> 07:52.312
Yeah, yeah.
Release the hook and let it go.

07:57.926 --> 08:00.224
Mm. You know what we need?

08:00.295 --> 08:02.763
Yeah, I got one right here.

08:05.166 --> 08:07.396
No, I meant
a couple of beers.

08:08.370 --> 08:10.361
- I'll go get 'em.
- I'll go with you.

08:10.438 --> 08:13.066
No, you stay here,
and I'll be back in a flash.

08:19.247 --> 08:22.182
- Okay, but don't take too long.
- Back in a minute.

08:23.251 --> 08:25.776
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

08:48.743 --> 08:51.507
- Hey, T.J.
- Hey,John, how ya doin'?

08:51.579 --> 08:54.207
I'm doing great.
Is something the matter?

08:57.085 --> 08:58.484
Same old shit.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.688
Howard really makes me gag.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.524
- You're not kidding.
- I kinda like Tommy.

09:08.596 --> 09:10.120
Oh, I agree.

09:11.232 --> 09:12.824
- Hi,John.
- Hi, girls.

09:14.469 --> 09:16.630
Yuck! What is this?

09:16.704 --> 09:19.832
Oh, wow. One of those idiots
really thinks he's funny.

09:23.311 --> 09:25.506
It's probably Howard.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.889
John, is that you?

10:17.331 --> 10:18.593
John?

10:26.874 --> 10:29.968
John, if you're trying to scare me,
you're doing a good job.

10:48.896 --> 10:50.864
Help! Help!

10:54.135 --> 10:55.796
No!

11:10.718 --> 11:12.447
No!

11:21.362 --> 11:23.296
Sorry I took so long, babe.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.434
Sylvia?

11:28.536 --> 11:30.470
Sylvia?

11:33.441 --> 11:36.410
All right.
Hey, all right.

11:37.612 --> 11:40.172
All right. Sylvia?

11:41.315 --> 11:44.284
I know you're in there,
and I'm comin' in.

11:47.755 --> 11:49.689
Sylvia?

12:15.149 --> 12:17.083
<i>Come in, Mobile One.</i>

12:18.386 --> 12:20.411
Mobile One here.

12:20.488 --> 12:22.479
<i>Jake, you just got</i>
<i>a call from Eastfield.</i>

12:22.557 --> 12:24.616
<i>A woman named Raleigh.</i>
<i>She said it was urgent.</i>

12:26.194 --> 12:29.129
All right.
Mobile One coming in.

12:38.639 --> 12:40.971
How 'bout a little trip
down to the mine?

12:41.042 --> 12:42.532
- The mine?
- It'll be great.

12:42.610 --> 12:44.271
It's like a roller coaster,
isn't it?

12:44.345 --> 12:46.006
It's 2,000 feet down.

12:46.080 --> 12:49.516
That's okay. It'll cheer her up.
Come on, Hollis.

12:49.584 --> 12:51.279
- Mike, let's go.
- What?

12:51.352 --> 12:53.582
-Hollis, you goin' down to the mine?
-Well--

12:53.654 --> 12:55.383
Yes. Come on.

12:55.456 --> 12:56.923
- All right!
- Come on.

12:56.991 --> 12:58.515
- Chicken.
- Chicken?

12:58.593 --> 13:01.221
- Why don't we go down to the mine?
- All right.

13:01.295 --> 13:03.058
One quick ride down
and right back up.

13:03.130 --> 13:04.722
What about gear?

13:04.799 --> 13:07.359
Yeah, get that six-pack.

13:07.435 --> 13:09.369
This is gonna
be great, baby!

13:17.945 --> 13:19.913
Watch your step.
Come on.

13:19.981 --> 13:22.916
This is ridiculous with you girls
in those dresses.

13:27.989 --> 13:30.719
Hollis! Where do you
think you're going?

13:30.791 --> 13:33.555
We're going for a quick ride
and coming right back up.

13:33.628 --> 13:37.826
You can't. You know the rule.
No women in the mine.

13:37.899 --> 13:39.764
We're gonna come right back
up again. Believe me.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.131
Watch your step.

13:48.309 --> 13:50.368
Howard, don't be
a pain in the ass.

13:50.444 --> 13:52.435
"Pain in the ass"?
What "pain in the ass"?

13:52.513 --> 13:55.004
- Watch your step, okay?
- Be careful.

13:55.082 --> 13:57.016
Down we go!

13:59.887 --> 14:03.152
Come on, you guys.
Hop in the cars. I'll be right back.

14:03.224 --> 14:05.658
- Yeah, we made it.
- You just let me know!

14:16.871 --> 14:18.805
Here, Sarah,
put this around you.

14:18.873 --> 14:21.068
Michael, here you go.
And a blanket.

14:21.142 --> 14:23.736
And a blanket?
Hollis, you got one for me?

14:23.811 --> 14:26.143
Here's one for you.
I'll be right back.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.773
Can you believe we're
really doing this?

14:32.687 --> 14:34.712
It's so dark
down there!

14:34.789 --> 14:37.622
On second thought, I think
I'm gonna stay right up here.

14:37.692 --> 14:40.718
No, you don't. If I'm goin' down
there, baby, you're goin' with me.

14:40.795 --> 14:42.729
- Oh, great.
- Hold on, everybody.

14:42.797 --> 14:44.662
Here we go!

14:44.732 --> 14:46.723
Keep your hands inside.

14:46.801 --> 14:50.396
- Pass me that beer!
- All right!

14:50.471 --> 14:52.439
Come on. Pass a couple
up this way.

14:52.506 --> 14:54.872
- Where's the lantern?
- Right here.Just stick with me.

15:00.881 --> 15:03.315
Look out below!

15:09.657 --> 15:11.648
Hold on.
Get ready for bumps.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.526
Hey, Hollis, pass me a beer.
Want one, Mike?

15:22.603 --> 15:24.969
How far down
does this go?

15:26.807 --> 15:29.105
- Come on, Sarah.
- Here you go.

15:35.249 --> 15:36.807
Wow!

15:36.884 --> 15:39.614
All right!

15:51.265 --> 15:53.324
Little bitty free ride.
There we go.

15:53.401 --> 15:55.335
- Stops all by itself.
- Great, Hollis.

15:55.403 --> 15:57.803
Let's go. Yeah, I hope you kids
enjoyed yourself...

15:57.872 --> 15:59.396
'cause we're goin' right back up.

15:59.473 --> 16:02.408
- That was great. Let's do it again.
- Howard usually walks.

16:04.412 --> 16:06.346
Let's do it again.
Come on.

16:07.448 --> 16:09.245
Where does that go?

16:09.316 --> 16:12.479
That leads to an abandoned part.
We don't go down there anymore.

16:12.553 --> 16:14.544
- Take us on a tour, Hollis.
- Yeah!

16:14.622 --> 16:17.750
- Yeah, let's show 'em around.
- All right, all right.

16:17.825 --> 16:19.759
Just because we're here.
Come on.

16:19.827 --> 16:21.761
Keep those blankets wrapped
around you. You're gonna get filthy.

16:21.829 --> 16:23.763
Okay, Daddy.

16:23.831 --> 16:25.560
It's cold down here.

16:26.634 --> 16:28.795
All right, boys and girls.
This is called a tipple.

16:28.869 --> 16:30.427
So that's a tipple.

16:31.572 --> 16:33.597
This is also
called a tipple.

16:36.610 --> 16:38.134
Hey, Howard, come on!

16:38.212 --> 16:39.611
- Comin'.
- Howard, come on!

16:39.680 --> 16:43.207
I'm comin'! I just heard something.
Probably some rats.

16:43.284 --> 16:46.276
Rats? You never
told me there are rats!

16:47.188 --> 16:49.122
This is the old engine room.

16:50.191 --> 16:52.125
Boy, what a nice view back here.

17:00.968 --> 17:03.528
We'll meet you in ten minutes
over at the main shaft!

17:03.604 --> 17:06.868
All right. No longer.
We're going straight up.

17:27.862 --> 17:29.796
How do you like my pad, huh?

17:37.571 --> 17:39.539
I can't believe you work here.

17:39.607 --> 17:41.040
Yep.

18:00.494 --> 18:03.156
- He's in there!
- What is it? What's the matter?

18:04.231 --> 18:06.222
He's in there!
He's in there!

18:07.801 --> 18:10.201
- What's going on? What's going on?
- His face!

18:16.343 --> 18:18.436
She's dead.

18:18.512 --> 18:21.515
- He killed--
- What are you talking about?

18:21.648 --> 18:23.172
What are you talking about?

18:23.250 --> 18:24.683
Dave is dead!

18:31.024 --> 18:33.515
And Sylvia!
Somebody's killed her!

18:33.593 --> 18:35.527
It's Harry Warden!
He's here!

18:35.595 --> 18:39.292
Everybody, get the fuck out!
Go! Go! Go!

18:45.639 --> 18:47.573
Come on! Come on!

18:48.842 --> 18:51.902
Son of a bitch must've
cut the phone lines!

18:51.978 --> 18:55.072
Listen to me. I want you to make
sure everybody gets out of here.

18:55.148 --> 18:59.812
I want you to get the chief and tell
him to get here, and fast! Now go!

19:03.390 --> 19:06.086
Sarah, she's in the mine
with the others.

19:06.159 --> 19:09.219
- What?
- Her, Hollis and Patty.

19:09.296 --> 19:12.629
They took the railcars down there.
They're in the mine right now.

19:12.699 --> 19:15.133
- We gotta get them out.
- That's where he probably is.

19:15.201 --> 19:17.135
He'll kill them!

19:17.203 --> 19:21.299
I'm gonna get them out.
Come on! Come on!

19:29.916 --> 19:32.146
Go! Go!

19:32.986 --> 19:34.419
Come on!

19:40.393 --> 19:42.327
If anything happens to Sarah,
it'll be your fault!

19:42.395 --> 19:44.260
You never should've let them
go down there!

19:44.331 --> 19:46.196
Let's worry about getting them out.

19:46.266 --> 19:48.029
I'll take the abandoned section.
You take the level above.

19:48.101 --> 19:50.569
We'll meet in the main shaft
by the elevator.

19:50.637 --> 19:52.969
I hope to God we get there
before Harry does.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.974
Good luck.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.125
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

20:25.405 --> 20:29.136
Boo! Gotcha.

20:29.209 --> 20:31.700
Damn you, Hollis.
Where the hell were you?

20:31.778 --> 20:34.474
I thought you were right behind me.
You must've taken the wrong tunnel.

20:34.547 --> 20:37.072
Oh, sure we did.
You did that on purpose.

20:37.150 --> 20:39.084
Me?

20:39.152 --> 20:41.086
Come on.

20:43.690 --> 20:45.851
Watch your head.
Watch your step as well.

20:53.933 --> 20:55.867
This is the oldest part
of the mine.

20:55.935 --> 20:57.095
Oh, gosh!

20:57.170 --> 20:59.297
These tunnels were built
in the early 1800s.

20:59.372 --> 21:02.830
- Really?
- Yeah, it's all abandoned now.

21:02.909 --> 21:05.207
We haven't worked down here
in years.

21:05.278 --> 21:07.405
Not since Harry Warden.

21:10.517 --> 21:13.111
Howard, what do you think
you're trying to do, you jerk?

21:13.186 --> 21:15.711
Easy. I got a hangover.

21:15.789 --> 21:19.225
- Boy, did you guys jump.
- I'll get you down.

21:20.627 --> 21:23.027
Oh, Howard, you goof.

21:23.096 --> 21:25.496
- Get down out of there.
- Wait. I'll go the other way.

21:25.565 --> 21:27.965
- For Pete's sake.
- I know what I'm doing.

21:31.004 --> 21:32.471
God, you guys.

21:32.539 --> 21:35.201
- Come on. Hold it.
- Ooh, that feels so good.

21:38.678 --> 21:41.112
- Get your light.
- Got it.

21:41.181 --> 21:42.580
- Okay?
- Yeah.

21:42.649 --> 21:44.640
- You all right?
- Come on.

21:44.718 --> 21:48.210
Get down! Stick with us
and quit clowning around.

21:48.288 --> 21:50.848
- I was just having some of fun.
- Yeah, sure.

21:50.924 --> 21:53.620
Hey, you guys,
where's Mike and Harriet?

21:53.693 --> 21:56.491
- Maybe Harry Warden got 'em.
- Stop it!

21:56.563 --> 22:00.260
- Howard, come along and behave.
- Yeah, let's go.

22:02.068 --> 22:03.695
- My blanket!
- Come on.

22:03.770 --> 22:06.500
You'd forget your head
if it wasn't tied on with rope.

22:06.573 --> 22:09.167
- It's freezing down here.
- Who's leading this tour?

22:20.286 --> 22:22.550
I feel so good.

22:22.622 --> 22:24.556
So do I.

22:32.799 --> 22:34.232
Where are we going now?

22:34.300 --> 22:37.201
This leads to the main shaft.
We're going up.

22:37.270 --> 22:39.898
How come the walls are
so white around here, Hollis?

22:39.973 --> 22:43.602
I told you, it's lime powder. They
put it here to contain explosions...

22:43.676 --> 22:46.804
and they put it on the wood
so it doesn't get dry and crack.

22:46.880 --> 22:50.646
Hey, you guys, how come Mike
and Harriet haven't come back yet?

22:55.321 --> 22:57.050
What's that?

23:07.066 --> 23:09.330
I thought I heard something.

23:09.402 --> 23:11.836
It's probably only rats.

23:11.905 --> 23:14.169
That ain't no rat.

23:14.240 --> 23:18.040
Come on. Let's go find Mike
and Harriet and get out of here.

23:19.479 --> 23:20.810
Come on.

23:43.503 --> 23:46.495
Tommy Whitcomb, what's the matter
with you? Where's your brains?

23:46.573 --> 23:48.507
- How many times have I told you--
- Chief, listen to me!

23:48.575 --> 23:50.805
You have to go to the mine.

23:50.877 --> 23:53.675
We were having a party, and Harry
Warden started killing everybody!

23:56.182 --> 23:59.777
Harry Warden is at the mine. There's
a bunch of kids trapped below.

23:59.853 --> 24:01.821
Axel and T.J.
are trying to get them out.

24:01.888 --> 24:04.186
He killed Sylvia and Dave!

24:04.257 --> 24:06.748
Get back in that car
and get home and stay put!

24:07.861 --> 24:09.294
Go on!

24:18.938 --> 24:20.872
- Mobile One in.
- <i>Go ahead, Chief.</i>

24:20.940 --> 24:23.101
Yeah, Ben.
Call the mayor right away.

24:23.176 --> 24:26.475
Then round up every available man.
Meet me back at the mine.

24:28.114 --> 24:30.412
I think there's some kids
trapped down below.

24:30.483 --> 24:32.576
Out.

24:32.652 --> 24:36.110
- Howard, would you get up front?
- I'm trying to get up in the front.

24:37.690 --> 24:39.624
- Do we know where we're going?
- I can't even see.

24:39.692 --> 24:41.626
Just stay beside me.

24:45.331 --> 24:48.323
- Why don't they answer us?
- Stavisky!

24:48.401 --> 24:50.596
We never should have
left them in the first place.

24:51.671 --> 24:54.003
- Maybe they're down there.
-Jesus!

24:54.073 --> 24:56.007
- What are you trying to do?
- You scared me!

24:56.075 --> 24:58.600
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, we're fine.

24:58.678 --> 25:02.011
- What's the matter with you?
- We gotta get out of here.

25:02.081 --> 25:04.015
Harry Warden is back.

25:04.083 --> 25:07.575
- He's killed Sylvia and Dave.
- Are you kidding?

25:07.654 --> 25:10.680
What are you saying? Harry's dead.
Harry died a long time ago.

25:10.757 --> 25:13.590
Will you shut up
and listen to me, goddamn it?

25:13.660 --> 25:16.185
Now, they're dead,
and he's down here somewhere.

25:16.262 --> 25:20.130
If you want to get out alive,
you do exactly as I tell you.

25:20.199 --> 25:21.826
What are we gonna do?

25:21.901 --> 25:24.768
This better not be
your idea of a joke, T.J.

25:24.837 --> 25:29.103
Do I look like I'm joking?
Come on. Let's go.

25:29.175 --> 25:31.803
Wait a minute, now.
What about Mike and Harriet?

25:31.878 --> 25:34.506
The last time I saw them,
they were in the engine room.

25:34.580 --> 25:37.743
You check the main shaft. I'll take
tunnel six and meet you there.

25:38.818 --> 25:40.718
Howard, you stay with the girls...

25:40.787 --> 25:42.448
- and wait for Axel.
- Me?

25:42.522 --> 25:45.150
- Stay with Howard. Stay there!
- No, Hollis, please!

25:45.224 --> 25:47.055
Hollis, wait a minute!

25:48.628 --> 25:51.495
Howard, you watch the girls!

25:52.765 --> 25:55.461
I don't even know
my way around here.

25:55.535 --> 25:57.560
Oh, shit!

26:04.344 --> 26:07.802
Michael and Harriet, this isn't
any time to be doing anything.

27:21.854 --> 27:24.084
Oh,Jesus!

27:39.772 --> 27:42.070
Oh, God, Hollis.

27:44.610 --> 27:47.101
Oh, it's not fair.

27:47.180 --> 27:49.114
Hollis, please--

27:58.691 --> 28:01.182
Come on.
He's dead. He's dead!

28:01.260 --> 28:04.593
- Come on! Come on!
- Patty, come on.

28:04.664 --> 28:06.928
Come on! He's dead!
Now come on!

28:11.003 --> 28:13.995
- Howard, you bastard!
- He's dead! Now come on!

28:14.073 --> 28:16.007
You can't leave us like this!

28:19.979 --> 28:21.913
Please, help me!

28:24.851 --> 28:27.217
- Leave him alone!
- Let go of me!

28:27.286 --> 28:29.550
Patty, we need the light,
damn it!

28:38.164 --> 28:40.098
Okay. Come on, Patty.

28:40.166 --> 28:43.397
Don't do this to me.
We have to get out of here!

28:45.471 --> 28:47.974
Stop it!

28:53.079 --> 28:54.171
Come on.

28:58.718 --> 29:02.347
Oh, my God.
Where are the others?

29:02.421 --> 29:04.753
We saw him.
He was standing right there.

29:04.824 --> 29:07.349
Harry Warden is down here!

29:07.426 --> 29:10.589
- Come on. Let's go.
- Come on.

29:10.663 --> 29:14.292
Let's go! Come on!
Where the hell is T.J.?

29:14.367 --> 29:16.392
He went looking
for Mike and Harriet.

29:16.469 --> 29:18.733
He told us to stay here.

29:22.408 --> 29:25.844
Come on. The cage
is right up ahead. Let's go!

29:25.911 --> 29:29.176
- Keep moving. You're gonna be fine.
- Axel, please, no!

29:33.452 --> 29:37.548
I don't want to leave him there.
Please, let's go back and get him.

29:39.158 --> 29:41.956
- Oh, please, Axel, no!
- Keep moving.

29:42.028 --> 29:45.327
- Patty, stop it.
- I don't wanna leave him there.

29:45.398 --> 29:47.332
You'll be fine.
You're gonna be just fine.

29:48.801 --> 29:52.703
- Where are you taking us?
- Keep moving. We're almost there.

29:52.772 --> 29:56.071
- I can't--
- Keep moving. You're doing fine.

29:56.142 --> 29:57.769
That's it.

29:58.844 --> 30:01.278
Oh, God, where are we going?

30:02.982 --> 30:04.916
I can't make it anymore!

30:04.984 --> 30:06.918
Shut up! Yes, you can!

30:06.986 --> 30:08.920
- Come on. Let's go!
- I can't!

30:08.988 --> 30:10.580
Let's go.

30:24.437 --> 30:26.598
Oh, God.

30:35.648 --> 30:37.582
It's T.J.

30:39.552 --> 30:42.715
- Aw, shit!
- What do you think you're doing?

30:42.788 --> 30:44.653
I'm sorry.
I thought you were Harry!

30:44.723 --> 30:46.657
Do I look like Harry?

30:46.725 --> 30:48.659
- Where's Howard?
- He ran off.

30:48.727 --> 30:51.696
That jerk. He's never gonna find
his way out of here alone.

30:51.764 --> 30:53.698
Hollis is dead.

30:53.766 --> 30:57.327
Look, we gotta get
Sarah and Patty up top...

30:57.403 --> 30:59.837
get some help
and come back for the others.

31:01.907 --> 31:03.932
- Come on.
- Okay, let's go.

31:04.009 --> 31:06.273
Come on. Come on.
Let's keep going.

31:56.295 --> 32:00.095
<i>Mobile One, come in.</i>
<i>Mobile One.</i>

32:01.200 --> 32:03.134
<i>Come in, Mobile One.</i>

32:09.008 --> 32:10.532
Watch your step.

32:10.609 --> 32:12.600
I can't even see.

32:13.679 --> 32:15.647
- We're almost there.
- Keep your voices down.

32:15.714 --> 32:17.648
Come on.

32:17.716 --> 32:20.651
- Please hurry.
- Keep your voices down.

32:42.541 --> 32:45.704
He smashed the control panel.
We're not getting out of here.

32:45.778 --> 32:47.245
What?

32:48.314 --> 32:51.112
What are we gonna do?

32:52.551 --> 32:54.143
Climb.

32:55.955 --> 32:57.149
Come on.

33:10.402 --> 33:12.893
Watch your footing, now.

33:12.972 --> 33:15.668
Axel, please slow down.

33:15.741 --> 33:18.676
Patty, you're okay.
I'm right behind you. Keep going.

33:27.119 --> 33:29.679
Come on. Don't look down.
Keep looking up.

33:29.755 --> 33:33.191
Patty, just do as he says
and you'll be fine. I promise.

33:39.698 --> 33:42.166
I don't want to go any further!

33:42.234 --> 33:45.101
Please, can we stop
and go another way?

33:45.170 --> 33:48.606
There's no other way!
Now move it, damn it!

33:59.718 --> 34:02.414
Axel, you have to go slower.
I'm right behind her.

34:02.488 --> 34:04.547
She keeps stopping.

34:04.623 --> 34:07.387
Go slower, okay?

34:19.071 --> 34:21.005
I'm scared of heights,
you guys.

34:21.072 --> 34:24.406
I'm not going any further.
I'm stopping right here.

34:24.476 --> 34:26.205
Sarah, give her a hand!

34:29.748 --> 34:31.681
It's okay.
I'm right behind you.

34:31.750 --> 34:33.911
I'm right behind you.
Come on.

34:35.187 --> 34:37.553
- Stay close.
- Okay. I'm right behind you.

34:38.623 --> 34:42.355
Good girl.
Keep moving. Good girl.

34:55.474 --> 34:58.102
Come down!
Come down, quick! Down!

35:19.498 --> 35:21.432
Don't look.

35:22.568 --> 35:24.559
Don't look at him.
Come on!

35:26.305 --> 35:28.398
Patty, over here.

35:32.177 --> 35:36.307
Now he's up top. That bastard's
really playing games with us.

35:36.382 --> 35:39.249
We can beat him if we
can get to the railcars.

35:39.318 --> 35:42.549
I know a shortcut through the sump.
It's over there.

35:42.621 --> 35:44.179
Let's go.

35:46.191 --> 35:48.125
Watch your step.

35:57.603 --> 35:59.537
Come on. Come on, come on.

35:59.605 --> 36:02.733
Nice and slow.
Let's go. Slowly.

36:04.376 --> 36:08.710
T.J., take the girls over, and give
me a yell when you're across, okay?

36:10.115 --> 36:11.548
Go!

36:13.719 --> 36:15.653
Watch your step.

36:33.172 --> 36:35.402
Okay, Axel, we're clear.
Come on over.

36:50.923 --> 36:52.891
T.J., do something.

36:52.958 --> 36:54.949
There's nothing I can do.

36:55.027 --> 36:56.961
It's 60-feet deep.

36:57.863 --> 36:59.330
Gosh!

36:59.398 --> 37:01.662
We've gotta get out of here.

37:01.733 --> 37:04.395
- We can't just leave him here.
- Move it!

37:05.471 --> 37:08.235
It's too late for Axel.

37:08.307 --> 37:09.899
Come on.

37:30.863 --> 37:33.297
Okay, you just hug along
the left side of the wall.

37:33.365 --> 37:35.890
Just keep going.
Go on. Continue.

37:37.569 --> 37:39.969
- But why--
-Just do as he says.

38:03.462 --> 38:05.396
Answer us.

38:15.107 --> 38:17.041
Let's go this way.

38:30.856 --> 38:32.448
Careful.

38:43.001 --> 38:46.027
Okay, there's gotta
be some way out of here.

38:46.104 --> 38:48.038
Come on. Keep going.

38:54.012 --> 38:55.604
Come on.

40:11.089 --> 40:12.681
Come on.

40:23.535 --> 40:25.264
It's okay.
I just got hit.

40:25.337 --> 40:27.271
Come on.
We've gotta hurry.

40:36.481 --> 40:38.415
The elevator isn't working.

40:38.483 --> 40:41.111
We're gonna have to go in
this way. Let's go!

41:01.506 --> 41:03.098
Jump!

42:08.907 --> 42:10.841
Everyone, watch this thing coming!

42:27.025 --> 42:28.959
Oh, my God.

42:40.639 --> 42:42.573
Sarah, move it!

42:46.111 --> 42:48.045
Get in. Get in!

42:56.188 --> 42:57.519
Watch out!

43:52.711 --> 43:53.803
Why?

44:16.568 --> 44:18.763
Come on.

44:18.937 --> 44:20.768
He's in there.

44:25.410 --> 44:28.174
Are you two all right?

44:30.382 --> 44:33.613
- It isn't Harry Warden.
- Yeah, I know, T.J.

44:34.553 --> 44:37.044
I got a call from Eastfield
late this evening.

44:38.457 --> 44:41.824
They said that Harry Warden
died five years ago.

44:41.893 --> 44:44.157
Well, then, who is it?

44:45.730 --> 44:49.826
- It's Axel.
- Oh, my God.

44:51.703 --> 44:53.637
Get where you're going.

44:57.008 --> 44:58.771
My God.

44:58.844 --> 45:03.110
It was on Valentine's Day that
Harry Warden killed Axel's father!

45:04.950 --> 45:06.884
- Let's get in there.
- Yeah.

45:34.146 --> 45:36.580
He's alive!

45:38.116 --> 45:40.050
Oh, my God!

45:48.126 --> 45:50.754
T.J., I have to see him!

45:53.498 --> 45:56.956
Hanniger, I'll be waiting
in hell for you!

45:57.035 --> 45:59.171
Harry, I'm coming!

46:00.105 --> 46:03.370
This whole fucking town
is going to die!

46:03.441 --> 46:06.103
We're coming back,
you bastards!

46:09.381 --> 46:11.849
Sarah, be my bloody valentine.

46:14.319 --> 46:18.517
<i>Daddy's gone away</i>

46:18.590 --> 46:23.050
<i>Harry Warden made you pay</i>

46:31.937 --> 46:35.668
<i>Once upon a time</i>
<i>on a sad Valentine's</i>

46:35.740 --> 46:40.177
<i>In a place known as Hanniger Mine</i>

46:40.245 --> 46:42.179
<i>A legend began</i>

46:42.247 --> 46:44.511
<i>Every woman and man</i>

46:44.583 --> 46:48.679
<i>Would always remember the time</i>

46:48.753 --> 46:52.655
<i>And those who remain</i>
<i>were never the same</i>

46:52.724 --> 46:57.252
<i>You could see</i>
<i>the fear in their eyes</i>

46:57.329 --> 47:01.129
<i>Once every year</i>
<i>as the 14th draws near</i>

47:01.199 --> 47:05.363
<i>There's a hush</i>
<i>all over the town</i>

47:05.437 --> 47:07.564
<i>Oh, the legend, they say</i>

47:07.639 --> 47:09.664
<i>On a Valentine's Day</i>

47:09.741 --> 47:13.973
<i>Is a curse that'll live on and on</i>

47:14.045 --> 47:18.277
<i>And no one will know</i>
<i>as the years come and go</i>

47:18.350 --> 47:22.081
<i>Of the horror from long time ago</i>

47:26.825 --> 47:29.191
<i>Twenty years came and went</i>

47:29.261 --> 47:34.494
<i>And everyone spent</i>
<i>the 14th in quiet regret</i>

47:35.700 --> 47:39.602
<i>And those still alive</i>
<i>know the secret survives</i>

47:39.671 --> 47:42.902
<i>In the darkness</i>
<i>that looms in the night</i>

47:43.908 --> 47:46.103
<i>Oh, the legend, they say</i>

47:46.177 --> 47:48.202
<i>On a Valentine's Day</i>

47:48.280 --> 47:52.478
<i>Is a curse that'll live on and on</i>

47:52.550 --> 47:54.609
<i>And no one will know</i>

47:54.686 --> 47:56.813
<i>As the years come and go</i>

47:56.888 --> 48:01.086
<i>Of the horror from long time ago</i>

48:01.159 --> 48:03.286
<i>In this little town</i>

48:03.361 --> 48:05.329
<i>When the 14th comes around</i>

48:05.397 --> 48:09.800
<i>There's a silence</i>
<i>and fear in the air</i>

48:09.868 --> 48:11.802
<i>Remember the morn</i>

48:11.870 --> 48:14.031
<i>That the legend was born</i>

48:14.105 --> 48:18.235
<i>All the shock</i>
<i>and the horror was there</i>

48:18.310 --> 48:20.301
<i>Oh, the legend, they say</i>

48:20.378 --> 48:22.505
<i>On a Valentine's Day</i>

48:22.580 --> 48:26.812
<i>Is a curse that'll live on and on</i>

48:26.885 --> 48:29.046
<i>And no one will know</i>

48:29.120 --> 48:31.145
<i>As the years come and go</i>

48:31.222 --> 48:35.488
<i>Of the horror from long time ago</i>

48:35.560 --> 48:38.051
<i>And no one will know</i>

48:38.129 --> 48:41.292
<i>As the years come and go</i>

48:41.366 --> 48:45.700
<i>Of the horror from long time</i>

48:45.770 --> 48:48.705
<i>Ago</i>

48:49.305 --> 48:55.543
