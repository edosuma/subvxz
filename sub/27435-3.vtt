08:54.530 --> 08:56.054
I'm sure the first question
they asked

08:56.130 --> 08:57.961
in response to my arrest
was whether

08:58.030 --> 09:00.237
I could still continue

Am I right, Harold?

09:03.040 --> 09:05.565
Mr. Cooper, you tell
your superiors at Main Justice

09:05.640 --> 09:08.108
that I just ordered a hearing
on the scope of the agreement,

09:08.180 --> 09:10.102
and I want a copy of it
on my desk today.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.117
We'll reconvene
In the morning.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.580
Mr. Reddington, you have
an attorney sitting out there

09:18.650 --> 09:20.652
who has no idea
what he's gotten into.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.278
I suggest
you fill him in.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.555
Actually, I don't think
that'll be necessary.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.154
Why is that?

09:26.230 --> 09:29.154
Because _after _
careful conSIderatIon
of the Circumstances,

09:29.230 --> 09:33.269
I feel it more prudent
to represent myself.

09:38.170 --> 09:39.774
His name is Spalding Stark.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.105
This guy is, like,
a total icon
in the biohacking community.

09:43.180 --> 09:45.171

about this guy for years.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.943

in 2009

09:50.020 --> 09:53.114
where he injected himself
with a homemade
malaria vaCCIne.

09:53.190 --> 09:55.408
Why would he do that?
To prove that it was safe.

09:55.490 --> 09:58.653
The FDA wouldn't authorize
human trials
without a ton of red tape.

09:58.730 --> 10:02.097
SO, get this,
the plan was to inject himself
with the vaccine,

10:02.160 --> 10:05.766
then let an infected
Anopheles mosquito bite him...

10:05.830 --> 10:07.661
...live.
And it worked?

10:07.740 --> 10:10.664
No. He suffered a catastrophic
hyper-immune response.

10:10.740 --> 10:13.436
Paralyzed half his face
along with his left arm
andleg.

10:13.510 --> 10:15.205
And that _makes him
anicon?
Yeah.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.498
He put his body
on the line to...

10:17.580 --> 10:18.979
To improve
the human condition.

10:19.050 --> 10:21.314
Well, he didn't stop there.
If Reddington's right,

10:21.380 --> 10:23.314
he just killed
five of his patients.

He's in federal prison

fight of his life.

the building owner on site,
just like you asked.

you're the one

(SIGHS) Not much.

11:01.460 --> 11:02.882
I mean,
I-I don't really know.

I own the building.
It's a storage space.

11:05.430 --> 11:07.022
Generally, I rent it out

11:07.100 --> 11:08.419
SO it was rented?

11:08.500 --> 11:11.128
Several days ago
by a guy named Stark.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.566
I never met him.
Just called the office
and booked it.

11:41.430 --> 11:43.068

were already dying.

11:43.130 --> 11:45.269

11:45.330 --> 11:47.093
what were they
injected with,

11:47.170 --> 11:48.432
and why'd they all die
so fast?

was my mistake.

We_ can make
adjustments.

somebody forgot
something.

of a jet injector.

must have broken it apart.

administered the medication?

where it came from.

17:14.830 --> 17:17.697
in all its grand
and Often gory detail,

17:17.770 --> 17:18.862
would you do it again?

Yes.
Why?

17:22.470 --> 17:24.529
Sorry,
I had two questions.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.107
_ Because
it saved lives.

everything about him,

17:47.960 --> 17:49.496

for one reason,

18:05.210 --> 18:07.678
so you could help us
find those criminals

18:08.350 --> 18:09.510

because of you.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.481
In some cases,
we recovered dangerous weapons

18:16.560 --> 18:18.755
or avoided
catastrophic outbreaks.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.229
Your Honor...
Let me finish!

18:21.830 --> 18:24.469
A few years ago, we learned
some of those criminals

18:24.530 --> 18:26.020
were inside
our own government.

18:26.100 --> 18:29.069
The Attorney General,
a National Security Advisor,

18:29.140 --> 18:31.165
the very people
our country depends on

18:31.240 --> 18:32.832
to maintain
law and order.

18:32.910 --> 18:35.299
To be Clear, none of that
would have happened

18:35.380 --> 18:36.574
without Mr. Reddington.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.707
SO, would I
do it again?

18:41.780 --> 18:43.384
You're damn right
I would.

18:46.350 --> 18:47.886
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.591
You lied to us,
Mr. Kirby.

18:55.660 --> 18:57.218
You said you never knew
Mr. Stark.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.358
That's the truth.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.829
SAMAR:
SO, it's a coincidence

19:00.900 --> 19:03.334
that Stark was using
a jet injector

19:03.410 --> 19:06.129
made by a company
that you're invested in?

19:08.210 --> 19:09.905
Okay, look.

19:09.980 --> 19:11.402
M-Maybe I do
know him.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.869
But I swear,
I wasn't there when...

19:13.950 --> 19:15.542
If you were working
with him,

19:15.620 --> 19:18.009
conning those people
out of their money,
you're an accomplice,

19:18.090 --> 19:20.081
and that means
you're gonna be charged
with ﬁve counts of murder.

19:20.150 --> 19:22.209
No, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

19:22.290 --> 19:23.621
I wasn't in this
for money.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.754
This was personal.

19:27.130 --> 19:30.725
I was diagnosed with MCDD
almost 11 years ago.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.860
Stark was my pharmacist
at Greene Drugs,

19:33.940 --> 19:36.591
and I used to see him
when I'd go in to get my meds.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.228
He could see
I was getting worse.

19:38.310 --> 19:41.404
My body wasn't responding
to the existing treatments
anymore.

19:41.480 --> 19:44.074
One day, he asked
ifI might be open

19:44.150 --> 19:45.879
to a more experimental
approach.

19:45.950 --> 19:48.145
You're saying that
Stark's treatment cured you?

19:49.320 --> 19:51.948
He came to me
a few weeks ago.

19:52.020 --> 19:55.012
Asked me to lend him
my warehouse

19:55.090 --> 19:56.785
so he could
expand his work.

19:56.860 --> 19:59.579
When I went to the warehouse
and saw what happened...

20:01.430 --> 20:03.125
Stark was already gone.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.919
(SIGHS)
I didn't know what to do.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.434
I'm telling you,
Spalding Stark
isn't a con man.

20:09.770 --> 20:11.203
He documented my case.

20:11.270 --> 20:13.807
I have copies of the files.
I can show you.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.632
He's the only reason
I'm alive.

20:18.610 --> 20:21.147
SIMA: You are aware
that the defendant

20:21.220 --> 20:23.882
has been indicted
on multiple counts
of treason?

our country?
Yes.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.628
You're aware that,
for almost 30 years,

20:32.690 --> 20:35.124
he's maintained
a vast criminal empire,

are so extensive
and so heinous,

20:44.640 --> 20:47.507
they occupy a unique place
in our country's history?

20:47.580 --> 20:50.071
I'm aware of the allegations.
I'm sorry. Allegations?

20:50.140 --> 20:53.007
Is it your position that
the defendant is innocent?

20:54.020 --> 20:56.011
Until proven guilty.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.288
Or is it your position
that I should ignore
the Constitution?

20:59.350 --> 21:00.681
My position, sir,

21:00.760 --> 21:03.854
is that some people
are irredeemable,

21:03.930 --> 21:07.422
that a deal granting immunity
to a man like Reddington

21:07.500 --> 21:10.253
is beneath the dignity
of a country

21:10.330 --> 21:12.628
that prides itself
on the rule of law.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.634
Objection.
He's arguing with the man,

21:14.700 --> 21:16.998
and, frankly, being
incredibly self-righteous.

21:17.070 --> 21:20.039
Sustained... The first part,
the arguing. Move on, Counsel.

21:20.110 --> 21:22.635
Sir, is there no one you
wouldn't make a deal with?

21:22.710 --> 21:25.247
If not this defendant,
is anyone too Offensive

21:25.310 --> 21:27.449
to be given a free pass
by your standards?

21:27.520 --> 21:28.873
Well, now he's just
being insulting.

21:28.950 --> 21:30.349
I said move on, Counsel.

21:30.420 --> 21:34.015
To be Clear, nobody gave
Mr. Reddington a free pass.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.857
He has to earn
his freedom.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.888
There are rules
he has to abide by.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.391
SIMA: I see.

21:43.600 --> 21:44.965
Really?
SO, to your knowledge,

he hasn't committed

of national security.

Okay, Your Honor...
You opened the door to this,
Director Cooper.

21:58.810 --> 22:01.176
Does he abide
by the rules or not?

22:01.250 --> 22:02.239
SIMA: I'll ask you again.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.185
To your knowledge,

22:04.250 --> 22:06.286
has Raymond Reddington

22:06.350 --> 22:09.217
committed any
unsanctioned crimes

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)

22:18.800 --> 22:21.496

that he has.

No.

RESSLER: Is there any idea
which way Wilkins is leaning?

22:32.510 --> 22:34.011
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Could go either way.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.344
I thought she'd rule after
my testimony yesterday,

22:37.420 --> 22:38.887
but she wants to hear
arguments first.

22:38.950 --> 22:40.178
The courtroom's
been cleared.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.285
We can't even watch.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.782
It's up
to Reddington now,

22:42.860 --> 22:45.784
which means we're back and
free to lend a hand on Stark.

22:45.860 --> 22:48.090
SAMAR: SO far, we know that
Stark worked as a pharmacist

22:48.160 --> 22:49.252
in one of the Greenes
here in DC.

22:49.330 --> 22:50.888
That's how he met Kirby.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.790
It's also how
he established contact

22:52.870 --> 22:54.132
with the five victims
from the warehouse.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.963
Greene is _
a national chain.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.632
Stark was accessing
its database

22:57.710 --> 23:00.599
and reaching out to patients
with advanced MCDD.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.432
I'm guessing those five
weren't the only ones.

23:02.510 --> 23:04.978
Let's follow up, see how many
people he contacted.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.245
There's a Chance he's done
other experimental trials.

23:07.310 --> 23:08.538
We could have more bodies
out there.

23:08.620 --> 23:09.973
I'll do it.
I'm going crazy

23:10.050 --> 23:11.642
waiting to hear
about Reddington.
(FOOTSTEPS)

23:11.720 --> 23:14.587
Guys, guys.
I went through Kirby's files.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.912
Everything he told us
is true.

23:16.990 --> 23:18.582
But Stark's
treatment works?

23:18.660 --> 23:20.184
_ It_all started _
With his own injuries.

23:20.260 --> 23:21.796
That malaria vaccine
he developed?

23:21.860 --> 23:23.293
It damaged
his motor cortex,

23:23.360 --> 23:24.998
which is why
he started studying

23:25.070 --> 23:26.992
all this stuff
in the first place.

23:27.070 --> 23:29.061
And he documented
everything,

23:29.140 --> 23:31.404
how he mapped out
the multi-allelic defects,

23:31.470 --> 23:33.734
how he developed
a viral payload

23:33.810 --> 23:36.836
designed to produce
hybrid cells with
corrected genomes.

23:36.910 --> 23:39.299
You honestly believe
he cured Kirby's condition?

23:39.380 --> 23:40.813
He reversed it,
no question.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.279
SO, Reddington's
first impression was right.

23:42.350 --> 23:44.580
Stark's a visionary.
COOPER: If that's true,

23:44.650 --> 23:46.811
What happened
at that warehouse?
I had the same question,

23:46.890 --> 23:48.312
so I went down
to the forensics lab

23:48.390 --> 23:51.257
and got a copy Of
the preliminary tox report.

23:51.330 --> 23:52.729
You won't believe
What they found.

23:53.430 --> 23:54.749
Sabotage?

23:54.830 --> 23:57.958
This is the treatment
formulation
used by Stark on you.

23:58.030 --> 23:59.998
This is the one
that was used

24:00.070 --> 24:01.890
on the five victims
from the warehouse.

24:01.970 --> 24:04.632
They're identical.
Except for one key component,

24:04.710 --> 24:06.735
an extremely rare nerve agent
called "Cylovex."

24:07.580 --> 24:09.036
A nerve agent?

24:09.110 --> 24:10.668
That's What killed
those people.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.844
And Whoever put it in there
didn't expect
the toxicology lab to find it,

24:13.920 --> 24:15.239
and for good reason.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.276
SAMAR: Normally, Cylovex
wouldn't be on anyone's radar,

24:17.350 --> 24:19.113
but with all the news
of the Russians

24:19.190 --> 24:21.215
allegedly using
Novichok in England,

24:21.290 --> 24:24.157
the FBI lab is on high alert
for anything like it now.

24:24.230 --> 24:25.857
Stark has a partner.

24:25.930 --> 24:27.557
His name is Ethan Webb.

24:27.630 --> 24:30.292
He synthesizes all of Stark's
formulations, including mine.

24:31.930 --> 24:33.898
Ethan wouldn't do it.

24:33.970 --> 24:35.437
Neven
Why not?

24:35.500 --> 24:37.832
I just told you,
they're partners.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.059
They're also friends.

24:39.140 --> 24:43.076
I-I don't believe Ethan
would kill those people.

24:43.140 --> 24:48.214
SIMA: Can you imagine,
immunity for
Raymond Reddington?

24:48.280 --> 24:52.717
Immunity for a man
who betrayed America,

24:52.790 --> 24:55.509
for number one
on the Most Wanted List,

24:55.590 --> 24:58.980
thousands Of crimes,
and how many victims?

24:59.060 --> 25:00.857
I-I can't even guess.

25:00.930 --> 25:02.795
This wasn't a deal.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.365
It was a conspiracy.

25:05.430 --> 25:09.196
An unjust
and illegal conspiracy

25:09.270 --> 25:12.899
to deprive the
American people
of justice.

25:12.970 --> 25:16.371
There is nothing
this defendant can do now

25:16.440 --> 25:19.443
that will erase_
the memory or the impact

25:19.510 --> 25:20.818
of What
he's already done.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.587
Your Honor, this court

25:23.650 --> 25:25.948
has the power
and the obligation

25:26.020 --> 25:28.454
to reject
government conduct

25:28.520 --> 25:31.057
that shocks
the conSCIence,

25:31.130 --> 25:34.019
conduct so outrageous,

our CIVIlized SOCIety,

25:40.300 --> 25:42.530
and that's exactly
What this agreement does.

25:42.600 --> 25:46.809
This agreement should be void
as a matter of public policy.

25:46.870 --> 25:50.749
Throw it out.
Tell the defendant, no more.

25:52.510 --> 25:57.641
Justice demands no less.

(KEYS CLACKING)
All right, that's him,
Dr. Ethan Webb,

26:02.120 --> 26:03.758
and according
to his profile,

26:03.830 --> 26:06.924
he's a synthetic biologist
and a molecular virologist.

26:06.990 --> 26:09.652
And guess where
he used to work.

26:11.330 --> 26:13.127
That's the company
I just met with.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.964
They're the leading
manufacturer
of MCDD medication.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.600
He used to work
for Big Pharma?
Until about two years ago

26:18.670 --> 26:20.900
when hew as fired and left
the company in disgrace.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.778
Fired for What?
Stealing proprietary data.

26:23.850 --> 26:25.909
They suspected he was working
on a cure on his own.

26:25.980 --> 26:27.675
That must be when
he partnered up with Stark.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.445
I don't understand.
If they were working together,

26:29.520 --> 26:31.283
Why would he sabotage
their progress?

26:31.350 --> 26:33.238
If there is a cure,
it's gonna be worth
a lot of money,

26:33.320 --> 26:34.958
so maybe Webb
wants it all
to himself.

26:35.020 --> 26:37.989

I still feel like we're
missing something.

many years ago.

The fact is, a small group
at the Department of Justice
did their due diligence,

27:21.600 --> 27:23.465
and With the blessing
of the Attorney General

27:23.540 --> 27:26.338
and Legal Counsel
at the White House,

27:26.410 --> 27:29.971
they concluded
that the benefit
that law enforcement

27:30.040 --> 27:31.974
and, consequently,
the American people

27:32.050 --> 27:34.041
would gain
from my assistance

27:34.120 --> 27:38.910
would exceed that
of the rather abstract
beneﬁt

27:38.990 --> 27:42.016
of seeing a man
of my alleged infamy

27:42.090 --> 27:45.423
being punished
in a public fashion.

27:46.460 --> 27:48.428
There can be no question

27:48.500 --> 27:50.388
they were legitimately
exercising

27:50.460 --> 27:52.690
their prosecutorial
discretion.

27:52.770 --> 27:54.032
They made
a judgment call.

27:54.100 --> 27:57.536
One that apparently
offends Mr. Sima,

27:57.600 --> 27:59.830

he's not alone.

to plumbers

virtually nothing about me

28:09.150 --> 28:11.584
or the events
of the last five years,

28:11.650 --> 28:15.416
nonetheless would find
my arrangement
with the government

28:15.490 --> 28:17.253

is that your outrage
doesn't concern me.

is that the powerful men

never happened.

29:22.420 --> 29:25.321
the facts have never
mattered less

29:25.390 --> 29:27.085
than they do today.

We're living
in a time when

29:31.170 --> 29:35.766

so diminished in value

29:35.840 --> 29:38.331
that even those
at the top of government

29:38.410 --> 29:40.503
are quite comfortable

29:40.570 --> 29:42.333
with truth being whatever

29:42.410 --> 29:44.173
they can convince
people to believe.

Wildly unacceptable.

he's done this before.

No, I don't think
he has done it before,

30:18.150 --> 30:20.209
but he is definitely
about to do it again.

30:20.280 --> 30:24.387
He's reached out to a handful
of late-stage MCDD patients
over the past few days.

another trial.

33:36.140 --> 33:38.540

33:38.610 --> 33:41.249
There are certain actions

the standard our citizens

from a country that prides
itself on the rule Of law.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.458

is guilty of the multitude

with which
he's been charged.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.690
He's never been tried.

34:01.470 --> 34:03.438
that Mr. Sima
would have me believe,

34:03.500 --> 34:05.559
I'd have to first accept
that Mr. Reddington

he's alleged to be.

your Objection is noted.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.737
The agreement stands.
Then he violated it.

34:43.810 --> 34:46.244
JUDGE WILKINS: Excuse me?
The agreement bars us

34:46.310 --> 34:49.040
from prosecuting the defendant
unless he violated it.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.145
Under the terms,
we would_then have
a right

34:52.690 --> 34:54.282
Oh, please.
Violated it how?

34:54.360 --> 34:56.419
The gun.
When you were arrested,

34:56.490 --> 34:59.129
you had an unregistered weapon
in your possession.

34:59.190 --> 35:01.124
But that's
a state crime.
Yes,

right up until someone
scratched the serial number
off Of it.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.292

a federal Offense.

JUDGE WILKINS:
He's right,
Mr. Reddington.

35:07.970 --> 35:09.699
I don't imagine
this agreement

35:09.770 --> 35:13.137
lets you walk around
with a defaced ﬁrearm.

35:13.210 --> 35:15.770
If you violated
your Obligations
under the deal,

35:15.840 --> 35:17.705
you've forfeited
its protections.

35:17.780 --> 35:20.408
To prove that, the gun
would have to be
admissible in evidence.

35:20.480 --> 35:23.540
Why wouldn't it be?
Because the Officer
who seized it

35:23.620 --> 35:26.339
was conducting an unreasonable
search and seizure.

35:27.620 --> 35:29.884
I see.

35:29.960 --> 35:33.225
I take it, then, that you
are moving to exclude the gun

the gun will be suppressed,

40:12.540 --> 40:13.666
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

40:15.010 --> 40:17.001
Oh, hey, come in.

40:18.650 --> 40:21.244
Cooper told me
about the gun hearing.

40:21.310 --> 40:23.847
I don't understand.
You know Raymond
always carries a weapon.

40:25.190 --> 40:26.612
That doesn't make it legal.

40:26.690 --> 40:29.011
Around here,
when it comes to Reddington,

40:29.090 --> 40:30.751
we kind of see
What we want to see.

40:33.190 --> 40:34.418
Are you okay?

40:35.700 --> 40:37.691
I'm confused.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.263
Someone betrayed us,
and I haven't been able
to figure out who.

40:41.270 --> 40:42.999
If there's anything
I can do...

40:43.070 --> 40:44.662
Actually,
there is something.

40:44.740 --> 40:48.904
Mr. Stark... I need
to speak with him
privately for Raymond.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.777
It cannot be recorded.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.444
He always
has his own agenda.

40:54.210 --> 40:55.416
What is it this time?

40:56.850 --> 40:58.408
(DOOR OPENS)

(DOOR CLOSES)

41:03.620 --> 41:06.157
DEMBE: Mr. Stark,
we don't have much time.
Dembe, how did you...

41:06.230 --> 41:08.186
I go Where
Mr. Reddington sends me.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.727
He's very concerned.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.325
_ _ _He made
a Significant investment
into your research.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.095
If you are unable
to deliver on schedule...

41:15.170 --> 41:18.333
No, no. Tell Mr. Reddington
I'm making progress.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.038
My situation here
won't interfere.

41:20.110 --> 41:21.600
I certainly hope not.

41:22.780 --> 41:24.429
Mr. Reddington
is counting on you.

41:27.250 --> 41:31.175
* With the holes in you?

41:31.250 --> 41:32.342
* With the holes in you *

41:32.420 --> 41:33.717
Sabotage.

41:34.790 --> 41:36.382
He sabotaged
your research.

41:36.460 --> 41:39.020
Dr. Webb betrayed you.

41:39.090 --> 41:41.251
He sabotaged
your research.

41:41.330 --> 41:43.059
Hey. Everything cool?

41:43.130 --> 41:44.358
Yes.

41:44.430 --> 41:46.728
Let's get out Of here.
I am starving.

is in the lead.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.179
MAN 3: We have
another team over on...

42:12.260 --> 42:15.525
Mr. Reddington,
welcome home.
