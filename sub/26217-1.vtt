What a lovely day, Cupcake.

01:05.864 --> 01:08.565
I know I've told you this
time and time again,

01:08.567 --> 01:11.335
but you are so lucky
to be a beautiful princess

01:11.337 --> 01:13.369
of the Kingdom of Wee Trolls.

01:13.371 --> 01:16.839
Well, that's so nice of you,
Fairy Pie,

01:16.841 --> 01:19.408
but you are my fairy godmother.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.845
What else are you going to say?

01:21.847 --> 01:24.648
Oh, dear.
What ever is the matter?

01:24.650 --> 01:27.717
I can tell you haven't
been yourself lately.

01:27.719 --> 01:31.687
Your usual cheer has given way
to a brooding introspection.

01:31.689 --> 01:35.826
It reminds me very much of your
father when he was your age.

01:35.828 --> 01:40.062
Yes, and look what he did...
traveled the world,

01:40.064 --> 01:41.698
found adventure,

01:41.700 --> 01:43.666
began writing his legacy.

01:43.668 --> 01:47.770
Yes, and he returned
to become king of his land

01:47.772 --> 01:50.073
and take good care
of his trolls.

01:50.075 --> 01:53.844
Your father is a fine
example of trollhood,

01:53.846 --> 01:57.780
and you've been simply
wonderful in his footsteps.

01:57.782 --> 02:00.851
That's just it, Fairy Pie.

02:00.853 --> 02:04.520
I don't want to follow
in my father's footsteps.

02:04.522 --> 02:09.658
I want to make my own way,
forge my own troll path.

02:09.661 --> 02:11.994
I want to leave
this little troll town

02:11.996 --> 02:14.564
and have adventures of my own.

02:14.566 --> 02:16.832
Cupcake, you're young!

02:16.834 --> 02:20.136
There will be plenty of time
for adventure in your days.

02:20.138 --> 02:21.938
But when?

02:21.940 --> 02:26.443
We're only young once,
and it doesn't last forever.

02:26.445 --> 02:28.145
You said that yourself.

02:28.147 --> 02:30.880
You're always telling me
about the things you did

02:30.882 --> 02:33.649
when you were my age
and how much you miss

02:33.651 --> 02:35.752
your reeling fairy days.

02:35.754 --> 02:39.956
Yes, well, the youth we lose is
eventually regained in wisdom.

02:39.958 --> 02:43.726
It is the cycle of life,
the Wee Troll way.

02:43.728 --> 02:47.164
That's what worries me,
Fairy Pie.

02:47.166 --> 02:51.034
Is the Wee Troll way
all I'll ever know?

02:51.036 --> 02:53.770
Oh, Cupcake,
you fret over nothing.

02:53.772 --> 02:57.673
The knowledge you seek will
find you when you need it most.

02:57.675 --> 03:00.743
Life is magical.

03:00.745 --> 03:03.212
I wish you'd tell that
to my father.

03:03.214 --> 03:05.782
He doesn't allow me
to do anything.

03:05.784 --> 03:08.517
Sometimes, I think
he just wants me

03:08.519 --> 03:13.923
to dress up like his princess,
look pretty, and wave. Ugh!

03:13.925 --> 03:17.493
Many trolls would love
to do just that.

03:17.495 --> 03:21.831
Then maybe
they could trade places with me.

03:21.833 --> 03:25.100
Be careful what you wish for,
my lovely princess.

03:25.102 --> 03:28.171
You'll find the grass is
often greener on the other side.

03:28.173 --> 03:30.673
Your father loves you.

03:30.675 --> 03:32.475
And I love you, too.

03:32.477 --> 03:36.580
Oh, Fairy Pie,
I don't mean to be a crab apple.

03:36.582 --> 03:38.915
You're not a crab apple,
Cupcake.

03:38.917 --> 03:43.520
You're just a young troll
full of wonder and curiosity.

03:43.522 --> 03:45.622
Here we are.
Why don't you go explain

03:45.624 --> 03:46.723
your feelings to your father?

03:46.725 --> 03:48.190
He may surprise you.

03:48.192 --> 03:50.493
I think I will.

03:50.495 --> 03:51.994
Thank you, Fairy Pie.

03:51.996 --> 03:53.730
Don't mention it.

03:53.732 --> 03:56.568
Just another day
for a fairy godmother.

04:08.113 --> 04:12.248
But, Cupcake, you're
the princess of our kingdom.

04:12.250 --> 04:14.917
How will it look
if you up and leave,

04:14.919 --> 04:17.152
all for pointless adventure?

04:17.154 --> 04:19.988
But it's not pointless to <i>me,</i>
Father.

04:19.991 --> 04:22.926
All my life,
I've done everything I could

04:22.928 --> 04:24.226
for our kingdom.

04:24.228 --> 04:27.863
Now I just want to do
something for me.

04:27.865 --> 04:30.032
All your life?

04:30.034 --> 04:33.036
Cupcake,
you're still a young troll.

04:33.038 --> 04:36.873
You still have so many
mountains left to climb.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.174
Then let me climb them.

04:39.176 --> 04:41.777
Oh, patience, Cupcake, patience.

04:41.779 --> 04:44.813
All things
will come in due time.

04:44.815 --> 04:47.183
Well, that's just it, Father.

04:47.185 --> 04:52.255
It's always wait, wait, wait
for a later day,

04:52.257 --> 04:55.125
but we only get so many days.

04:55.127 --> 04:59.563
And you have many more
than most, sweet daughter.

04:59.565 --> 05:04.166
Remember, us trolls
live 1,000 years,

05:04.168 --> 05:07.703
and sometimes, like your
Gramps Filbert the Grumbler,

05:07.705 --> 05:09.738
to 1,010.

05:09.740 --> 05:13.810
Plenty of time to find
your prince and settle down.

05:13.812 --> 05:19.082
Ugh, but how can I settle down
if I never take off?

05:19.084 --> 05:24.921
Oh, Cupcake, I'm afraid I don't
have the easy answers you seek.

05:24.923 --> 05:27.823
In this life,
we want many things

05:27.825 --> 05:31.928
and, sometimes,
never attain them...

05:31.930 --> 05:35.632
though we do find
other things that fulfill us.

05:35.634 --> 05:40.837
Life will set your sails
in the direction you most <i>need,</i>

05:40.839 --> 05:42.871
not <i>want.</i>

05:42.873 --> 05:46.342
Why do I always feel like
you talk to me in riddles?

05:46.344 --> 05:50.981
I'm a troll, dear.

05:50.983 --> 05:53.717
We invented riddles.

05:53.719 --> 05:55.185
Did I ever tell you about

05:55.187 --> 05:59.388
your Great-Gramps
Archduke Godavius the Flat?

05:59.390 --> 06:04.794
He's credited with
the first riddle ever created.

06:04.796 --> 06:09.298
It was the year 992.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.967
Oh, Father!

06:30.322 --> 06:32.856
Hey, there, Scorch.

06:32.858 --> 06:34.823
How's your tail hanging?

06:34.825 --> 06:37.760
What do you want, Grunt?

06:37.762 --> 06:42.798
I don't recall inviting
a little, measly creature

06:42.800 --> 06:46.669
such as yourself to my lair.

06:46.671 --> 06:49.972
I just came by
to say hi to my old pal.

06:49.974 --> 06:51.173
Hiya, Scorchie.

06:51.175 --> 06:54.277
We're not pals, creature,

06:54.279 --> 06:59.683
and you know I don't like
unannounced visitors.

06:59.685 --> 07:01.918
But, Scorch, how can you say so?

07:01.920 --> 07:04.953
You and me, w-we go way back.

07:04.955 --> 07:07.390
But, Scorch, buddy...

07:07.392 --> 07:13.063
I told you,
we're not buddies, puny worm.

07:13.065 --> 07:18.101
Now leave, or I might be
forced to devour you,

07:18.103 --> 07:20.703
ugly face and all.

07:20.705 --> 07:23.272
Oh, oh.

07:23.274 --> 07:26.842
S-Say, Scorch,
before you devour me,

07:26.844 --> 07:30.279
I-I want to...
I want to extend an invitation.

07:30.281 --> 07:33.817
An invitation?
Uh, to what?

07:33.819 --> 07:37.053
Your friends
are scared to death of me,

07:37.055 --> 07:39.955
and rightfully so.

07:39.957 --> 07:44.960
They look like
tasty hors d'oeuvres to me.

07:44.962 --> 07:46.996
I know, right?

07:46.998 --> 07:49.067
Some of them do.
I'll give you that.

07:51.069 --> 07:56.972
So, I wanted to invite you
to... to team up with me.

07:56.974 --> 07:59.909
- Team up?
- Yeah.

07:59.911 --> 08:02.010
Me and you.
A cool duo.

08:02.012 --> 08:04.279
Like Butch and Sundance,
Starsky and Hutch,

08:04.281 --> 08:06.448
Riggs and Murtaugh,
Thelma and Lo...

08:06.450 --> 08:08.418
Okay, I get it.

08:08.420 --> 08:11.354
Save your stinky breath, troll.

08:11.356 --> 08:15.293
What would I team up
with you for, anyway?

08:16.026 --> 08:17.794
Wreak havoc, of course.

08:17.796 --> 08:20.195
Run roughshod,
pillage and plunder.

08:20.197 --> 08:25.135
Prepare to be served on
a plate of radicchio, creature.

08:25.137 --> 08:28.337
I've had just about enough
of you.

08:28.339 --> 08:29.806
Wait!

08:29.808 --> 08:31.241
Scorch, hear me out.

08:31.243 --> 08:34.208
You and me, we both rule
our individual worlds

08:34.211 --> 08:35.943
with iron fists, right?

08:35.946 --> 08:38.014
Imagine
what we could do together.

08:38.015 --> 08:39.948
We'll be unstoppable.

08:39.950 --> 08:42.885
The whole world will tremble.

08:45.857 --> 08:48.390
You ridiculous worm.

08:48.392 --> 08:52.261
Nobody even knows who you are.

08:52.263 --> 08:55.899
That's because I let
no enemy survive, see?

08:55.901 --> 08:58.834
Cross me, and, boom,
you disappear.

08:58.836 --> 09:00.305
Really?

09:01.071 --> 09:02.304
What do you say, old pal?

09:02.306 --> 09:04.506
Me and you,
a fearsome new alliance,

09:04.508 --> 09:06.842
the land bowing to our will.

09:06.844 --> 09:08.377
We can start right away.

09:08.379 --> 09:12.515
Uh, sorry,
goofy little creature.

09:12.517 --> 09:15.518
No can do.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.154
Now leave.

09:18.156 --> 09:19.454
Hmm.

09:19.456 --> 09:21.191
I tried the nice way, Scorch,

09:21.193 --> 09:24.394
but you leave me
no other choice.

09:24.396 --> 09:29.064
What are you talking about,
ludicrous creature?

09:29.066 --> 09:33.169
I'm gonna make you join me,
you big, moronic goof.

09:33.171 --> 09:36.172
Excuse me?

09:36.174 --> 09:37.539
You heard me.

09:37.541 --> 09:39.442
I wanted to be nice
and offer you the chance

09:39.444 --> 09:43.246
to agree of your own free will,
stupid, but no.

09:43.248 --> 09:44.847
You're too dumb for that.

09:44.849 --> 09:46.182
I should have known.

09:46.184 --> 09:49.218
Grunt, get out of here right now

09:49.220 --> 09:52.956
before I sneeze
and turn you to cinder.

09:55.493 --> 09:57.193
Just try it, peabrain.

09:57.195 --> 10:00.996
You have no idea
who you're dealing with,

10:00.998 --> 10:02.130
but you will.

10:02.132 --> 10:05.034
All right.
That's it.

10:05.036 --> 10:07.636
Don't say I didn't warn you.

10:10.175 --> 10:18.114
Aaaarrrrghhh!

10:18.116 --> 10:21.550
Around, around you go.

10:21.552 --> 10:24.987
Down the toilet,
the water flows.

10:24.989 --> 10:28.191
And with the water,
you must know,

10:28.193 --> 10:32.127
down, down the toilet,
you will go.

10:36.334 --> 10:39.936
Well, uh, how do you feel,
you big lug?

10:39.938 --> 10:42.972
Uh, I'm just a big lug.

10:42.974 --> 10:46.009
It don't matter how I feel.

10:46.011 --> 10:48.010
That's right.

10:48.012 --> 10:50.112
You're a big old goofy lug,

10:50.114 --> 10:54.183
and you're <i>my</i> big old goofy lug
to do as I please.

10:54.185 --> 10:57.687
- Got it?
- Uh, yeah.

10:57.689 --> 10:59.923
I got it.

10:59.925 --> 11:01.557
Good.

11:01.559 --> 11:04.394
Now fly by my side,
you big dummy,

11:04.396 --> 11:06.962
as I conquer
the Kingdom of the Wee Trolls

11:06.964 --> 11:09.365
and take my rightful place
on the throne!

11:11.268 --> 11:15.038
I'll stick with you, Grunt.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.241
What else
can a big dummy like me do?

11:18.243 --> 11:21.077
Nothing, and now you realize it.

11:21.079 --> 11:23.612
You're too dumb to comprehend
this, but I just hit you

11:23.614 --> 11:26.381
with the Mighty Spell
of the Dreary Put-downs.

11:26.383 --> 11:29.485
And if you even think
of breaking ranks with me,

11:29.487 --> 11:33.489
I'll put you in your place
with a few well-worded insults,

11:33.491 --> 11:36.159
and you'll believe
everything I say is true,

11:36.161 --> 11:37.492
you big, ugly goober.

11:37.494 --> 11:38.962
Understood?

11:38.964 --> 11:43.167
Understood.

11:44.199 --> 11:46.468
Good. Now, come on.
And forget your nap.

11:46.470 --> 11:50.673
We have work to do,
you lazy, overgrown lizard.

11:50.675 --> 11:57.382
Um, growl-l-l-l.

12:19.204 --> 12:22.505
Oh, Bellyrumble,
sometimes I wish

12:22.507 --> 12:26.108
we could strike out over
those hills and just keep going.

12:26.110 --> 12:28.010
But... But that's a long way.

12:28.012 --> 12:29.345
What would we eat, Leaf?

12:29.347 --> 12:32.582
Do you ever think
of anything but food?

12:32.584 --> 12:36.019
I don't think so. Is there
anything better to think about?

12:36.021 --> 12:40.255
How about travel,
mystery, adventure?

12:40.257 --> 12:43.326
Pasta, sandwiches.

12:43.328 --> 12:45.260
Dessert.

12:45.262 --> 12:47.362
Uh, forget it.

12:47.364 --> 12:50.332
- You want to grab lunch?
- Do I ever!

12:50.334 --> 12:53.736
Wait. Are we gonna eat
around here or, like, far away?

12:53.738 --> 12:55.237
Around here, Bellyrumble.

12:55.239 --> 12:57.039
We'll eat around here.

12:57.041 --> 12:59.509
Phew! Great.
I'm in.

12:59.511 --> 13:02.178
I heard the castle's serving
lunch for local trolls,

13:02.180 --> 13:03.513
if you want to go there.

13:03.515 --> 13:05.247
Where did you hear that?

13:05.249 --> 13:06.548
Direct from the source.

13:06.550 --> 13:08.617
Princess Cupcake told me.

13:08.619 --> 13:09.818
Oh, yeah?

13:09.820 --> 13:12.621
You talk to the princess often?

13:12.623 --> 13:14.823
Yep.
All the time.

13:14.825 --> 13:18.294
My father was her orthodontist
when she got braces, remember?

13:18.296 --> 13:21.164
We were tiny Wee Trolls
and made fast friends.

13:21.166 --> 13:24.366
Lucky you. Wish I had been
friends with her, too.

13:24.368 --> 13:26.635
Uh, how is she these days?

13:26.637 --> 13:29.539
She's great.
And pretty.

13:29.541 --> 13:32.542
Teeth look good and straight...
for a troll, anyway.

13:32.544 --> 13:34.776
I think the trolls have
the prettiest princess

13:34.778 --> 13:36.312
in all the land.

13:36.314 --> 13:38.614
We sure do.

13:38.616 --> 13:40.783
So, you like her, huh?

13:40.785 --> 13:42.851
What makes you say that?

13:42.853 --> 13:44.287
It's obvious, Leaf.

13:44.289 --> 13:46.188
You get that goofy smile
on your face

13:46.190 --> 13:47.789
every time her name comes up.

13:47.791 --> 13:51.327
Well, maybe I just
support our monarchy.

13:51.329 --> 13:53.096
You ever think of that?

13:53.098 --> 13:57.199
Uh-huh, and maybe you have
a crush on Princess Cupcake.

13:57.201 --> 13:59.735
Yeah. Hmm.

13:59.737 --> 14:03.405
Okay, maybe you're right.

14:03.407 --> 14:04.673
You should talk to her.

14:04.675 --> 14:06.409
Ask her to lunch over moldy soup

14:06.411 --> 14:07.776
and rotten cheddar or something.

14:07.778 --> 14:10.145
And make King Basil mad at me?

14:10.147 --> 14:11.347
No way!

14:11.349 --> 14:12.881
Who says he'd get mad?

14:12.883 --> 14:14.449
Everybody likes food.

14:14.451 --> 14:16.452
Some more than others.

14:16.454 --> 14:20.789
Yeah, but you don't just march
up and ask the princess out.

14:20.791 --> 14:22.191
Why not?

14:22.193 --> 14:23.893
She's a troll, just like you.

14:23.895 --> 14:26.228
And living up there
in the castle all her life,

14:26.230 --> 14:28.231
she probably doesn't
have many friends,

14:28.233 --> 14:30.132
much less a troll-friend.

14:30.134 --> 14:31.433
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.369
Who said anything
about troll-friends?

14:33.371 --> 14:35.770
I'm... I'm not trying to be
her troll-friend.

14:35.772 --> 14:38.207
You... You better keep
your big mouth shut

14:38.209 --> 14:40.675
before we all get in trouble
with the king.

14:40.677 --> 14:43.312
Okay, okay,
my lips are sealed...

14:43.314 --> 14:44.880
unless I see
a roast beef sandwich

14:44.882 --> 14:46.716
with a side
of loaded potato salad.

14:46.718 --> 14:49.151
Then my lips are wide open.

14:49.153 --> 14:51.721
I can take a hint.

14:51.723 --> 14:54.723
- Let's go eat.
- All right!

14:54.725 --> 14:56.794
Whoo-hoo!

15:04.502 --> 15:06.235
Mm-hmm.

15:06.237 --> 15:08.938
I smell bacon
and trapdeleracon dragon eggs.

15:08.940 --> 15:10.606
Scrumptious.

15:10.608 --> 15:12.174
Which way is it coming from?

15:12.176 --> 15:14.342
I'll let you sniff it out,
Bellyrumble.

15:14.344 --> 15:16.248
Your nose never fails.

15:22.586 --> 15:24.419
There you are!

15:24.421 --> 15:26.422
Leaf, Bellyrumble,

15:26.424 --> 15:28.924
something terrible has happened!

15:28.926 --> 15:32.395
Willow! Don't tell me
they ran out of baked beans.

15:32.397 --> 15:34.730
I can't live
without baked beans.

15:34.732 --> 15:37.232
No, no.

15:37.234 --> 15:40.202
No, guys.
That's not it.

15:40.204 --> 15:41.736
It's the maple cornbread?!

15:41.738 --> 15:43.639
Oh, no.
I knew it.

15:43.641 --> 15:45.741
It's Scorch!

15:45.743 --> 15:47.476
They scorched the bread?

15:47.478 --> 15:49.611
Say it isn't so.

15:49.613 --> 15:51.746
I think
Willow's trying to tell us

15:51.748 --> 15:53.316
something important,
Bellyrumble,

15:53.318 --> 15:56.919
and I don't think
it's related to food.

15:56.921 --> 16:00.222
If it's not related to food,
it cannot be important, Leaf.

16:00.224 --> 16:01.957
Scorch is loose!

16:01.959 --> 16:03.896
He... He took flight!

16:04.728 --> 16:07.429
He's unleashed!

16:07.431 --> 16:08.563
Scorch?

16:08.565 --> 16:10.799
But how? Why?

16:10.801 --> 16:12.702
Grunt got to him.

16:12.704 --> 16:16.805
He cast some weird spell,
messed with his dragon head.

16:16.807 --> 16:18.374
Oh, no.

16:18.376 --> 16:19.708
Grunt's behind this?

16:19.710 --> 16:21.677
That's bad news for all of us.

16:21.679 --> 16:24.779
Nothing good can come
of that troll's involvement.

16:24.781 --> 16:26.249
You got that right, Leaf.

16:26.251 --> 16:27.817
That troll's a stinker.

16:27.819 --> 16:30.252
So, just to be clear,
the beans are fine, yeah?

16:30.254 --> 16:32.722
Oh, the beans are fine.

16:32.724 --> 16:34.423
Phew!

16:34.425 --> 16:36.826
I almost cried, Leaf.
Real tears.

16:36.828 --> 16:39.595
Willow, do you know
what Grunt's up to?

16:39.597 --> 16:41.764
Why Scorch?
Why now?

16:41.766 --> 16:42.999
I don't know.

16:43.001 --> 16:44.866
I tried to hear his plans,

16:44.868 --> 16:48.437
but I was afraid if I got
any closer to Scorch's lair,

16:48.439 --> 16:50.539
he'd spot me.

16:50.541 --> 16:53.375
Leaf, what if they're
coming after the food?

16:53.377 --> 16:55.845
We can't take a hit like that.
We'll starve!

16:55.847 --> 16:58.447
They're not coming
after the food, Belly.

16:58.449 --> 16:59.781
How do you know?

16:59.783 --> 17:02.050
What would they do
with baked beans?

17:02.052 --> 17:04.686
It's not the baked beans, guys!

17:04.689 --> 17:07.390
I think Grunt cast
some kind of spell.

17:07.392 --> 17:08.657
A spell?

17:08.660 --> 17:11.026
But Grunt doesn't know magic.

17:11.028 --> 17:14.365
You might want to tell him that.

17:14.998 --> 17:16.931
Now that I have you

17:16.933 --> 17:18.900
as my servant and confidant,
Scorch,

17:18.902 --> 17:21.036
things are going to be
different around here.

17:21.038 --> 17:25.407
Trolls are gonna know
Grunt's name. And not just that.

17:25.410 --> 17:28.843
They're gonna do what I say
when I say it.

17:28.845 --> 17:31.249
What will you say?

17:31.982 --> 17:34.883
I'll say, "Ignore the big,
dumb dragon behind me.

17:34.885 --> 17:37.386
He doesn't know what he's doing
unless I tell him."

17:37.388 --> 17:41.590
And then you'll shut up and
let me do the talking, right?

17:41.592 --> 17:43.659
Uh, right.

17:43.661 --> 17:45.660
And with your might, Scorch,

17:45.662 --> 17:48.764
I'll finally gain access
to the Kingdom of the Goblins.

17:48.766 --> 17:50.332
And when I do...

17:50.334 --> 17:52.767
And when you do...

17:52.769 --> 17:55.504
Don't interrupt my thought,
you overstuffed handbag.

17:55.506 --> 17:57.439
Don't you know
what a pregnant pause is?

17:57.441 --> 17:58.674
Nope.

17:58.676 --> 18:02.378
Aw.
It's a pause for effect.

18:02.380 --> 18:03.978
It's part of the presentation.

18:03.980 --> 18:07.917
Every good villain keeps you
hanging on their every word

18:07.919 --> 18:11.687
as they lay out
their nefarious plans.

18:11.689 --> 18:14.556
You're supposed to just,
like, stare or cower

18:14.558 --> 18:16.391
and... and let me finish.

18:16.393 --> 18:19.695
Oh, right.
Okay.

18:19.697 --> 18:21.397
Uh, go ahead.

18:21.399 --> 18:23.466
"Go ahead" what?

18:23.468 --> 18:25.801
Cower, you overgrown iguana.

18:25.803 --> 18:28.407
Oh, yeah.

18:28.940 --> 18:32.807
So, Grunt started firing
all these insults at Scorch,

18:32.809 --> 18:37.380
and I thought, "Uh-oh.
Now he's gone and done it.

18:37.382 --> 18:41.550
That big dragon's gonna stomp
that little gnome into dust."

18:41.552 --> 18:42.985
Only, he didn't.

18:42.987 --> 18:45.521
It seemed like
all the mean stuff

18:45.523 --> 18:49.557
Grunt was saying started
making Scorch feel really bad.

18:49.559 --> 18:53.829
Oh! Then I started feeling bad
just listening to it.

18:53.831 --> 18:56.832
It's making me feel bad
just hearing you tell it.

18:56.834 --> 18:58.967
Like, a true bummer.

18:58.969 --> 19:04.172
You guys, this might even
be worse than it sounds.

19:04.174 --> 19:07.176
Really? 'Cause it sounds
pretty awful, Leaf.

19:07.178 --> 19:09.678
If what Willow's describing
is accurate,

19:09.680 --> 19:11.880
it sounds like
Grunt may have mastered

19:11.882 --> 19:15.083
the Mighty Spell
of the Dreary Put-downs.

19:15.085 --> 19:16.851
The Dreary Put-downs?

19:16.853 --> 19:19.889
Wasn't that the name of
Grunt's old band back in school?

19:19.891 --> 19:22.123
That's right.
It was.

19:22.125 --> 19:25.460
Oh, I remember them.

19:25.462 --> 19:28.531
Yeah, they were disqualified
from the troll talent show

19:28.533 --> 19:29.965
after Grunt hit
Principal Butternose

19:29.967 --> 19:31.867
over the head with a drumstick.

19:31.869 --> 19:33.436
Ever since that day,

19:33.438 --> 19:35.938
Grunt's held a grudge
against all trolls.

19:35.940 --> 19:38.807
It wouldn't surprise me at all
if he mastered that spell

19:38.809 --> 19:42.945
as some misguided attempt at
revenge against the Wee Trolls.

19:42.947 --> 19:46.849
But that was so long ago.

19:46.851 --> 19:50.052
Why would he carry
something like that around?

19:50.054 --> 19:54.189
Why not just move on, live life?

19:54.191 --> 19:57.059
'Cause Grunt's a troll.

19:57.061 --> 19:59.527
So what?
I'm a troll.

19:59.529 --> 20:02.096
No.
I mean, he's a troll.

20:02.098 --> 20:05.167
You know...
He <i>trolls</i> trolls.

20:05.169 --> 20:06.634
What?

20:06.636 --> 20:09.671
Like, he creates discord
on purpose,

20:09.673 --> 20:12.941
like starting quarrels to
provoke others just to have fun.

20:12.943 --> 20:14.709
Oh, I see.

20:14.711 --> 20:16.512
Trolling a troll.

20:16.514 --> 20:17.746
Yeah.

20:17.748 --> 20:19.715
Sometimes
when wounds don't heal,

20:19.717 --> 20:22.884
and we focus on lashing out
at some troll who's wronged us,

20:22.886 --> 20:24.486
we get stuck in the past.

20:24.488 --> 20:27.156
Then we hurt ourselves
as much as any troll

20:27.158 --> 20:28.724
we try to get back at.

20:28.726 --> 20:31.627
Wow.
That's deep, Leaf.

20:31.629 --> 20:33.262
If Grunt really is wielding

20:33.264 --> 20:35.698
the Mighty Spell
of the Dreary Put-downs,

20:35.700 --> 20:38.234
we've got a heck of a problem
on our hands.

20:38.236 --> 20:40.268
OMG!

20:40.270 --> 20:44.707
We're gonna get trolled!

20:44.709 --> 20:47.775
Guys, if Grunt's motives
prove true,

20:47.777 --> 20:49.711
I'm afraid
our Kingdom of Wee Trolls

20:49.713 --> 20:51.580
could be in a lot of danger.

20:51.582 --> 20:52.715
What can we do?

20:52.717 --> 20:54.783
I have no idea.

20:54.785 --> 20:58.954
I certainly wasn't expecting to
see what I saw out there today.

20:58.956 --> 21:00.622
Now that I'm thinking about it,

21:00.624 --> 21:03.825
there <i>is</i> someone
who might be able to help.

21:03.827 --> 21:04.927
Who?

21:04.929 --> 21:07.662
Thorn the Warlock.

21:07.664 --> 21:10.131
Thorn the what?
Where do we find him?

21:10.133 --> 21:13.134
He lives
in the Land of the Warlocks.

21:13.136 --> 21:17.171
It's a bit of a journey,
but it's all I've got.

21:17.173 --> 21:19.909
That's it, then.
We can't risk the kingdom.

21:19.911 --> 21:21.142
We have to go see Thorn.

21:21.144 --> 21:22.878
Willow, are you with us?

21:22.880 --> 21:24.880
Us?

21:24.882 --> 21:28.316
Me?
Uh, I have something going on.

21:28.318 --> 21:30.221
A prior engagement.

21:31.055 --> 21:34.723
Oh, all right. I'm too scared
for all this, Leaf.

21:34.725 --> 21:35.990
I'm no hero.

21:35.992 --> 21:37.592
I'm just a woodland creature

21:37.594 --> 21:41.162
who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

21:41.164 --> 21:43.599
Or the right place
at the right time.

21:43.601 --> 21:45.767
You might have just saved
our kingdom, Willow.

21:45.769 --> 21:49.938
Oh, even more pressure.
Great.

21:49.940 --> 21:52.640
It's okay.
You don't have to come with us.

21:52.642 --> 21:54.576
Bellyrumble and I can handle it.

21:54.578 --> 21:55.878
We can?

21:55.880 --> 21:57.912
Yes, we <i>can.</i>

21:57.914 --> 22:00.783
We'll leave before dark
and get a head start.

22:00.785 --> 22:02.117
We will?

22:02.119 --> 22:04.887
- What about dinner?
- Pack snacks.

22:04.889 --> 22:07.089
We can be there by morning
if we leave soon.

22:07.091 --> 22:11.060
Oh, I love snacks.
My pack will be pretty heavy.

22:11.062 --> 22:14.862
- Can I carry all that? Hmm?
- Thanks for the tip, Willow.

22:14.864 --> 22:18.667
If you talk to King Basil about
this, tell him not to worry.

22:18.669 --> 22:22.004
Leaf and Bellyrumble
are on the case.

22:22.006 --> 22:24.305
Will do, Leaf.

22:24.307 --> 22:27.610
Sorry I'm not as brave
as you guys.

22:27.612 --> 22:29.111
But you are, Willow.

22:29.113 --> 22:31.013
We're all brave in our own ways.

22:31.015 --> 22:34.082
If you hadn't seen what you saw,
we might have been blindsided

22:34.084 --> 22:36.150
by Grunt and Scorch at any time.

22:36.152 --> 22:38.387
At least now we have
a chance to stop them.

22:38.389 --> 22:39.822
Yeah!

22:39.824 --> 22:42.091
Oh, thanks, you guys.

22:42.093 --> 22:44.092
And good luck out there.

22:44.094 --> 22:47.028
Well, we'll need it.

22:47.030 --> 22:48.831
We will?

22:48.833 --> 22:51.199
Did you talk to your father,
Cupcake?

22:51.201 --> 22:55.169
- Oh. I did.
- And?

22:55.171 --> 22:58.107
I should have kept
my thoughts to myself.

22:58.109 --> 23:01.243
He did what he always does
and spoke in riddles,

23:01.245 --> 23:04.013
hypotheticals, and metaphors.

23:04.015 --> 23:06.215
It did no good at all.

23:06.217 --> 23:08.650
Oh, dear, I'm sure
that's not the case.

23:08.652 --> 23:11.120
Your father loves you
so very much,

23:11.122 --> 23:13.354
and he wants the best
for you at all times.

23:13.356 --> 23:15.290
That much I'm sure of.

23:15.292 --> 23:18.826
Sometimes it feels like
he just wants me to be

23:18.828 --> 23:21.429
like a pretty butterfly
under glass.

23:21.431 --> 23:24.099
Your father, the king, cares

23:24.101 --> 23:28.836
and wants nothing more than to
protect his only little troll.

23:28.838 --> 23:30.872
Then he's never heard
of the saying

23:30.874 --> 23:33.842
"If you love something,
set it free."

23:33.844 --> 23:36.911
But, Cupcake,
there are perils out there

23:36.913 --> 23:40.248
beyond the safety
of the kingdom.

23:40.250 --> 23:43.351
As king, your father
knows this only too well.

23:43.353 --> 23:46.155
And I'm willing
to face them head on.

23:46.157 --> 23:48.390
I'm not a child anymore.

23:48.392 --> 23:50.993
I wish my father could see that.

23:50.995 --> 23:55.698
You'll always be
that toothy baby troll to him.

23:55.700 --> 24:00.169
Yes, well, that's the problem,
Fairy Pie.

24:00.171 --> 24:02.707
That's the problem.

24:15.719 --> 24:18.320
Look up ahead!
There it is, Bellyrumble...

24:18.322 --> 24:20.354
the Warlock Castle.

24:20.356 --> 24:24.726
Mm, I sure hope
Thorn the Warlock can help us.

24:24.728 --> 24:26.294
We're about to find out.

24:26.296 --> 24:27.896
Come on.
Let's do this.

24:27.898 --> 24:29.898
We need to get back
and warn King Basil.

24:29.900 --> 24:33.004
And if we also have a solution,
it will be that much better.

24:42.747 --> 24:46.482
Attackers, who has sent you?

24:46.484 --> 24:49.517
Attackers? Us?
No!

24:49.519 --> 24:51.386
We mean no harm, Thorn.

24:51.388 --> 24:53.421
Apologies for the intrusion,

24:53.423 --> 24:57.059
but we were directed to see you
by a concerned friend.

24:57.061 --> 24:59.495
Oh?
Concerned about what?

24:59.497 --> 25:02.464
Well, that's just it.

25:02.466 --> 25:05.833
Uh, we're not exactly sure.

25:05.835 --> 25:08.169
Not sure?

25:08.171 --> 25:10.872
What brand of madness is this?

25:10.874 --> 25:14.776
Who's the sorcerer that has led
confused garden gnomes

25:14.778 --> 25:15.977
to my castle?

25:15.979 --> 25:17.845
Garden gnomes?
No, no.

25:17.847 --> 25:22.184
I'm a troll. From
the Kingdom of the Wee Trolls.

25:22.186 --> 25:24.887
And I'm a fairy
from the Great Land of Lard.

25:24.889 --> 25:27.922
Tomato, to-mah-to.

25:27.924 --> 25:31.025
I grow succulent Romas
in my garden,

25:31.027 --> 25:33.829
and I always need
a good gnome or two

25:33.831 --> 25:36.799
to protect them
from the fairy wasps.

25:36.801 --> 25:41.903
How would you gnomes like
to work for Thorn the Warlock?

25:41.905 --> 25:45.940
I don't send you
on baffled goose chases

25:45.942 --> 25:48.377
like your current employer.

25:48.379 --> 25:50.411
We appreciate the offer, Thorn,

25:50.413 --> 25:53.549
but we really came here
of our own accord.

25:53.551 --> 25:56.884
We know a dreadful little troll
named Grunt,

25:56.886 --> 26:01.122
who somehow mastered the Mighty
Spell of the Dreary Put-downs.

26:01.124 --> 26:04.458
Ah.
Is that so?

26:04.460 --> 26:06.093
Yes, and he's used it

26:06.095 --> 26:08.197
on the most powerful
creature in our land...

26:08.199 --> 26:11.899
- Scorch the Mighty Dragon.
- Scorch.

26:11.901 --> 26:14.570
I have tried for millennia
to recruit Scorch,

26:14.572 --> 26:17.005
but he's his own dragon.

26:17.007 --> 26:21.109
It would surely take a magician
of considerable strength

26:21.111 --> 26:23.978
to weaken that dragon's resolve.

26:23.980 --> 26:26.547
Well, I think
we know that magician,

26:26.549 --> 26:29.450
and he's up to no good.

26:29.452 --> 26:31.419
Indeed, gnome,

26:31.421 --> 26:35.157
if one were to fill
that mighty dragon with magic,

26:35.159 --> 26:38.593
I can't think
of any spell more powerful

26:38.595 --> 26:42.898
than the Mighty Spell
of the Dreary Put-downs.

26:42.900 --> 26:45.033
That's exactly our concern,
Thorn.

26:45.035 --> 26:47.101
And with Scorch on his side,
there's no telling

26:47.103 --> 26:49.170
what mayhem that runt Grunt

26:49.172 --> 26:51.907
can unleash
on our peaceful kingdom.

26:51.909 --> 26:55.878
Those words you speak
are true, gnome.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.946
Come on!

26:57.948 --> 27:00.882
Listen to me,
and listen closely.

27:00.884 --> 27:03.886
The Mighty Spell
of the Dreary Put-downs

27:03.888 --> 27:07.121
has felled daring souls
for longer

27:07.123 --> 27:09.257
than I've been practicing magic.

27:09.259 --> 27:11.059
Whoa.

27:11.061 --> 27:14.196
Its formidable power
saps brave spirits

27:14.198 --> 27:17.632
and crushes the hopes
of dreamers everywhere

27:17.634 --> 27:20.302
by robbing them
of their gumption

27:20.304 --> 27:24.305
and instilling insidious,
insurmountable doubt.

27:24.307 --> 27:26.909
- Oh, my.
- When attacked

27:26.911 --> 27:29.410
with the Mighty Spell
of the Dreary Put-downs,

27:29.412 --> 27:33.081
heroes can become cowards,

27:33.083 --> 27:35.583
powerhouses
can become weaklings,

27:35.585 --> 27:39.987
and wise men can become fools.

27:39.989 --> 27:43.324
It makes its victims
feel so worthless

27:43.326 --> 27:46.695
that they succumb to the will
of the spell's wielder,

27:46.697 --> 27:49.997
becoming mindless minions.

27:49.999 --> 27:54.335
The spell can also banish
beings to other lands,

27:54.337 --> 27:58.974
- even other dimensions.
- Oh, wow.

27:58.976 --> 28:03.978
Anyone who masters this spell
stands an excellent chance

28:03.980 --> 28:06.948
of toppling
any kingdom they choose.

28:06.950 --> 28:10.953
And if this Grunt
has targeted your land,

28:10.955 --> 28:16.324
well, I'm afraid your situation
is at its most dire.

28:16.326 --> 28:18.025
Can you help us, Thorn?

28:18.027 --> 28:21.095
I'm afraid not, gnome.

28:21.097 --> 28:23.631
Hey, for the last time,
we are not...

28:23.633 --> 28:25.534
Then is there
anything we can do?

28:25.536 --> 28:27.601
Any way
we can combat this spell?

28:27.603 --> 28:30.505
Or at least stop the little
troll who's wielding it?

28:30.507 --> 28:34.575
I suggest you warn
your king at once.

28:34.577 --> 28:38.112
- That's it?
- Unless you gnomes

28:38.114 --> 28:41.049
would like to guard
my Roma tomatoes.

28:41.051 --> 28:42.717
No, that's okay.

28:42.719 --> 28:44.352
Thanks for your time, Thorn.

28:44.354 --> 28:45.987
Let's go, Belly.

28:45.989 --> 28:47.221
Yeah, let's.

28:47.223 --> 28:49.393
We have a kingdom to save!

28:51.027 --> 28:53.762
Can you believe that...
calling us gnomes?

28:53.764 --> 28:55.496
I wonder if he's ever
even met a fairy

28:55.498 --> 28:58.265
- from the Great Land of Lard.
- Doesn't matter.

28:58.267 --> 28:59.668
The Kingdom of the Wee Trolls

28:59.670 --> 29:01.703
needs us now more than ever,
Belly.

29:01.705 --> 29:04.706
And whether some old warlock
wants to help us or not,

29:04.708 --> 29:07.074
I don't plan to let
the trolls down.

29:07.076 --> 29:08.543
That's right.

29:08.545 --> 29:11.580
That old buster really lit
a fire under me, Leaf.

29:11.582 --> 29:14.382
Let's stop that jerk Grunt
and make sure that Troll Land

29:14.384 --> 29:17.785
is safe and secure
for all trolls... and fairies.

29:17.787 --> 29:19.588
That's the spirit.

29:19.590 --> 29:21.790
Hoorah!

29:21.792 --> 29:24.426
Belly, what's gotten into you?

29:24.428 --> 29:27.161
I thought you were worried
about all this.

29:27.163 --> 29:28.630
Oh, I am.

29:28.632 --> 29:30.399
I'm scared silly, actually.

29:30.401 --> 29:32.300
But I brought
some candy bars with us,

29:32.302 --> 29:33.735
and I've been nibbling.

29:33.737 --> 29:36.103
Think I'm having a sugar rush.

29:36.105 --> 29:39.541
- I'll probably crash soon.
- Gotcha.

29:39.543 --> 29:41.575
Well, the trip back
is always faster.

29:41.577 --> 29:43.678
Whoo-hoo!

29:43.680 --> 29:47.515
Let's go-o-o-o-o-o!

29:47.517 --> 29:51.154
Ohh, boy.

29:59.328 --> 30:01.429
Here we are, Scorch.

30:01.431 --> 30:03.398
The Evil Goblins' Kingdom.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.266
I've only read about this place,

30:05.268 --> 30:08.070
but I always knew
I'd come here one day.

30:08.072 --> 30:10.775
Why did you always know, Grunt?

30:11.642 --> 30:15.610
Because, you dumb goof,
I've been destined for power

30:15.612 --> 30:17.148
since I was a tad-troll.

30:17.713 --> 30:19.714
I just had to bide my time

30:19.716 --> 30:22.583
and wait for the right moment,
like now.

30:22.585 --> 30:25.486
Oh, I see.

30:25.488 --> 30:27.188
No, you don't, dummy.

30:27.190 --> 30:28.823
You only see
what I point out to you.

30:28.825 --> 30:31.860
Now keep your jaw shut
and your fangs bared.

30:31.862 --> 30:36.564
But, uh,
how can I keep my jaw shut

30:36.566 --> 30:40.435
and my fangs bared
at the same time?

30:40.437 --> 30:42.336
You know what I mean.

30:42.338 --> 30:44.808
No, I really don't.

30:45.875 --> 30:49.544
Scorch, I swear,
if you don't stop needling me,

30:49.546 --> 30:52.113
I'm gonna turn you into a gecko.

30:52.115 --> 30:54.682
Then you'll be even uglier
than you are now.

30:54.684 --> 30:57.151
You want that?

30:57.153 --> 31:01.755
- Uh, I hate geckos.
- That's right.

31:01.757 --> 31:03.859
Geckos are ugly...

31:03.861 --> 31:05.893
even if you're smart enough
to know that,

31:05.895 --> 31:09.397
and I use the word "smart"
very loosely.

31:09.399 --> 31:13.235
Now, when we meet the goblin
king, you let me lead.

31:13.237 --> 31:16.537
- Got it?
- Where will you lead him?

31:16.539 --> 31:19.674
Sometimes, I don't
know how you made it this far.

31:19.676 --> 31:22.744
Uh, I just followed you, Grunt.

31:22.746 --> 31:25.780
Where you go, I go.
Remember?

31:25.782 --> 31:28.850
I can't even... Oh!
Forget it.

31:28.852 --> 31:31.253
Come on.
Let's find that goblin king.

31:31.255 --> 31:33.588
I'm gonna give him
an offer he can't refuse.

31:36.927 --> 31:40.394
Lock up King Basil
and throw away the key?

31:40.396 --> 31:41.862
Why would I do that?

31:41.864 --> 31:44.666
Goblins have no quarrel
with the trolls.

31:44.668 --> 31:48.503
Maybe not,
but do you know the Wee Trolls

31:48.505 --> 31:51.805
have never respected
your people or your kingship?

31:51.807 --> 31:53.507
So what?

31:53.509 --> 31:56.911
What do I care about opinions
from another land?

31:56.913 --> 32:00.649
And who are you, troll?

32:00.651 --> 32:03.384
How do I know
these disparaging opinions

32:03.386 --> 32:05.486
don't start and end with you?

32:05.488 --> 32:09.591
You just got to
take my word for it, King Frown.

32:09.593 --> 32:14.461
Eh. If I took the word of
all who came before my throne,

32:14.463 --> 32:16.797
I'd have been overthrown
long ago

32:16.799 --> 32:20.334
and would be panhandling coins
from you

32:20.336 --> 32:22.469
on your way
through our goblin gates.

32:22.471 --> 32:25.239
Begone, strange troll.

32:25.241 --> 32:27.842
But you. Ohh!

32:27.844 --> 32:30.978
We could use a good dragon
around here

32:30.980 --> 32:35.883
to keep rabble like this
from wandering in unannounced.

32:35.885 --> 32:37.485
Rabble?

32:37.487 --> 32:40.522
King Frown, allow me
to introduce myself.

32:40.524 --> 32:43.457
My name's Grunt.

32:43.459 --> 32:45.893
Uh-huh.

32:45.895 --> 32:47.562
What say you, dragon?

32:47.564 --> 32:49.965
Care to join our Goblin Kingdom?

32:49.967 --> 32:52.900
You can have
all the trapdeleracon eggs

32:52.902 --> 32:54.869
you can eat for your first year.

32:54.871 --> 32:57.405
Maybe you didn't hear me, King.

32:57.407 --> 32:59.908
I said, "My name is G..."

32:59.910 --> 33:04.713
I heard you just fine,
sales-troll, and I'm not buying.

33:04.715 --> 33:06.715
Now let yourself out,

33:06.717 --> 33:10.418
or I'll have my castle guards
show you the way.

33:10.420 --> 33:12.454
Oh.

33:12.456 --> 33:14.488
That won't be necessary, King.

33:14.490 --> 33:16.024
Or possible.

33:16.026 --> 33:19.893
Have you, uh, seen
your guards lately?

33:19.895 --> 33:21.630
You haven't, have you?

33:21.632 --> 33:24.299
Guards!

33:24.301 --> 33:26.368
Guards!

33:26.370 --> 33:29.271
Save your breath, ruler.

33:29.273 --> 33:31.706
Like I just said,
my name's Grunt,

33:31.708 --> 33:34.842
and I'm calling the shots now.

33:34.844 --> 33:36.777
You're mad.

33:36.779 --> 33:39.480
You'll meet the gallows
for this.

33:39.482 --> 33:42.586
Scorch, give him
a demonstration.

33:43.353 --> 33:49.690
Rrrrarrggh!

33:49.692 --> 33:52.494
So, there's that, and, uh...

33:52.496 --> 33:55.296
Guard!

33:55.298 --> 33:56.965
I told you already...

33:56.967 --> 33:58.499
There are no guards.

33:58.501 --> 34:00.669
I turned them into dung beetles.

34:00.671 --> 34:04.672
And they're now busy
rolling dung.

34:04.674 --> 34:06.541
But, uh...

34:06.543 --> 34:08.612
But... B-But...

34:09.612 --> 34:12.013
These are the effects
of the Mighty Spell

34:12.014 --> 34:14.783
of the Dreary Put-downs.

34:14.784 --> 34:19.020
Your guards are now beetles,
and you are powerless before me.

34:19.022 --> 34:22.424
I'll turn you
into a dung beetle, too...

34:22.426 --> 34:26.027
unless you choose
to accept my deal.

34:26.029 --> 34:27.495
Deal?

34:27.496 --> 34:29.397
What deal?

34:29.399 --> 34:30.531
Oh.

34:30.533 --> 34:33.368
One I think you'll enjoy...

34:33.370 --> 34:36.971
more than becoming
my minion, anyway.

34:36.973 --> 34:39.373
Like I said, lock up King Basil,

34:39.375 --> 34:44.645
and, in return, I'll deliver
his daughter, Princess Cupcake.

34:44.647 --> 34:49.551
Or should I say your new bride,

34:49.553 --> 34:51.953
Queen Frown?

34:51.955 --> 34:55.556
Hmm.

34:55.558 --> 34:59.460
Gutsy, troll.
Very gutsy.

34:59.462 --> 35:02.629
I've been called worse.

35:02.631 --> 35:04.565
I've been searching for a queen

35:04.567 --> 35:08.603
with whom to share my kingdom
for some time now.

35:08.605 --> 35:11.739
And you will finally have one.

35:11.741 --> 35:14.641
Delivered to you
on a silver platter.

35:14.643 --> 35:18.045
And what will become
of the Kingdom of the Wee Trolls

35:18.047 --> 35:20.382
once their king is deposed?

35:21.651 --> 35:25.623
How does "King Grunt" sound?

35:34.598 --> 35:35.996
I hope the king's home, Leaf.

35:35.998 --> 35:37.799
What if he's out
hunting trapdeleracons

35:37.801 --> 35:39.734
and Grunt attacks us?

35:39.736 --> 35:42.469
We'll do what any good troll
would do, Belly...

35:42.471 --> 35:45.105
defend the castle
as if it were ours.

35:45.107 --> 35:47.875
I knew I should have grabbed
dinner before we did this.

35:47.877 --> 35:49.411
Halt!

35:49.413 --> 35:50.978
Who goes there?

35:50.980 --> 35:55.683
It's us, Warble...
Leaf and Belly Rub.

35:55.685 --> 35:59.687
There are no friendships
on duty.

35:59.689 --> 36:02.957
Turn around
and return to your posts.

36:02.959 --> 36:04.591
Warble, come on.

36:04.593 --> 36:06.895
We need to see King Basil.
It's important.

36:06.897 --> 36:08.929
Yeah.
Remember that jerk Grunt,

36:08.931 --> 36:10.964
who used to pick on you
in troll school?

36:10.966 --> 36:13.967
He's learned magic, and he's
plotting against the kingdom.

36:13.969 --> 36:16.904
No way!

36:16.906 --> 36:21.109
Uh, turn around,
or I'll run you through.

36:21.111 --> 36:24.078
Come on, Warble.
You're just talking crazy now.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.547
Yeah.
We're just trying to help.

36:26.549 --> 36:28.949
You don't want to hurt
the kingdom, do you, Warble?

36:28.951 --> 36:30.988
What's going on here?

36:32.922 --> 36:34.989
Did I hear you right?

36:34.991 --> 36:37.692
Grunt is plotting against us?

36:37.694 --> 36:40.862
I'm afraid so, Princess,
and it's not just him.

36:40.864 --> 36:43.832
He's got Scorch the Dragon
on his side.

36:43.834 --> 36:46.167
Ohh!

36:46.169 --> 36:48.937
Now the plot thickens.

36:48.939 --> 36:53.942
You didn't say anything
about Scorch being involved.

36:53.944 --> 36:56.044
Lies, Princess.

36:56.046 --> 37:00.047
These two
were reputed class clowns.

37:00.049 --> 37:03.585
They can't be trusted.

37:03.587 --> 37:05.752
Oh, nonsense!

37:05.754 --> 37:07.688
Stand down, Warble.

37:07.690 --> 37:10.658
I'm taking these two
to see my father.

37:10.660 --> 37:12.226
Follow me.

37:20.002 --> 37:21.835
Wee Grunt?

37:21.837 --> 37:25.707
Surely, you creatures
are mistaken.

37:25.709 --> 37:31.147
What could he possibly have
against our kingdom?

37:32.815 --> 37:34.915
I don't know, King.
All I know is,

37:34.917 --> 37:36.884
he's always been a malcontent,

37:36.886 --> 37:40.187
and now he's learned dark magic
and enlisted Scorch.

37:40.189 --> 37:41.955
It adds up to trouble.

37:41.957 --> 37:44.826
I think it's better
to be safe than sorry.

37:44.828 --> 37:47.594
But what magic
could little Grunt

37:47.596 --> 37:53.768
possibly have learned that
would imperil our whole kingdom?

37:53.770 --> 37:57.241
The Mighty Spell
of the Dreary Put-downs.

38:01.611 --> 38:05.145
Scorch,
once that lousy King Basil's

38:05.147 --> 38:08.181
out of the way, and I take my
rightful seat on his throne...

38:08.183 --> 38:11.152
Oh.
I hope it ain't warm.

38:11.154 --> 38:14.656
There ain't nothing I hate worse
than sitting on a warm throne

38:14.658 --> 38:16.223
after someone
just gets off of it.

38:16.225 --> 38:17.991
Blechh! Icky!

38:17.993 --> 38:21.828
Why don't you just build
your own throne, Grunt?

38:21.830 --> 38:25.667
As king,
you can do whatever you want.

38:25.669 --> 38:28.268
Yeah!

38:28.270 --> 38:30.772
I'll just build a new one.

38:30.774 --> 38:32.839
Better yet,
I'll have <i>you</i> build it.

38:32.841 --> 38:34.875
You're a big, dumb lug.

38:34.877 --> 38:37.344
You can handle
the construction gigs.

38:37.346 --> 38:41.149
Oh. Okay.

38:41.151 --> 38:43.650
And with the king
and his spoiled brat

38:43.652 --> 38:45.319
gone to the goblins forever,

38:45.321 --> 38:50.857
I'll rechristen this land
Kingdom of the Mighty Grunt.

38:54.129 --> 38:56.029
Breathe fire, stupid.

38:56.031 --> 38:57.699
What?!

38:57.701 --> 38:59.801
You're supposed to breathe fire

38:59.803 --> 39:01.538
to punctuate what I said.

39:02.138 --> 39:03.337
Oh, never mind.

39:03.339 --> 39:06.007
The future's so bright, Scorch,

39:06.009 --> 39:07.741
we should get you some shades.

39:07.743 --> 39:10.243
In fact, why wait?

39:10.245 --> 39:14.281
I'm gonna put my plan in action
right now, this very instant.

39:16.752 --> 39:20.989
Sharpen my sword
and direct my word.

39:20.991 --> 39:23.891
Bring permanent toil and trouble

39:23.893 --> 39:27.962
with legless cat
and wingless bird.

39:27.964 --> 39:31.732
King Basil's crown
in the soup shall bubble.

39:34.136 --> 39:37.138
The Mighty Spell
of the Dreary Put-downs?

39:37.140 --> 39:40.808
I've only seen it used once
in all my years...

39:40.810 --> 39:42.310
on Ollie the Savage.

39:42.312 --> 39:44.745
He was never the same
after that.

39:44.747 --> 39:46.813
Indeed.

39:46.815 --> 39:50.018
He was known
as Ollie the Sensitive

39:50.020 --> 39:51.284
after that spell...

39:51.286 --> 39:54.254
until he eventually wandered off
one day,

39:54.256 --> 39:56.991
never to return.

39:56.993 --> 39:59.192
He disappeared?

39:59.194 --> 40:00.862
I'm afraid so.

40:00.864 --> 40:03.297
He left a sorrow-filled letter
in his wake,

40:03.299 --> 40:05.799
and, poof, gone.

40:05.801 --> 40:07.435
That's terrible.

40:07.437 --> 40:11.304
Yeah. How do we guard against
a spell that can do that?

40:11.306 --> 40:14.241
I'd say there's no need.

40:14.243 --> 40:17.178
We haven't seen
that spell in ages,

40:17.180 --> 40:22.183
and its potency depends greatly
on the one who wields it.

40:22.185 --> 40:26.154
Even if he were able
to throw it,

40:26.156 --> 40:31.058
Grunt hasn't practiced magic
long enough to truly wield

40:31.060 --> 40:36.299
the full power of the Mighty
Spell of the Dreary Put...

40:40.002 --> 40:42.469
Father?
Father!

40:42.471 --> 40:44.004
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

40:44.006 --> 40:46.239
Say it isn't so.

40:46.241 --> 40:48.442
Leaf? Look.
Where did he go?

40:48.444 --> 40:50.377
What do we do?!

40:50.379 --> 40:52.746
I-I don't know.

40:52.748 --> 40:54.214
We're under attack.

40:54.216 --> 40:55.716
We have to regroup.

40:55.718 --> 40:58.286
- We must...
- Run?

40:58.288 --> 41:00.855
One, two, three, four.

41:00.857 --> 41:03.491
Phew!
We're all still here.

41:03.493 --> 41:05.393
All but one.

41:05.395 --> 41:07.995
Don't fall apart on me,
Fairy Pie.

41:07.997 --> 41:11.065
Does every troll have
all their fingers and toes?

41:11.067 --> 41:13.167
- Check.
- Yes.

41:13.169 --> 41:15.303
- Yes.
- Okay.

41:15.305 --> 41:19.005
Father taught me to stay calm
in the heat of battle.

41:19.007 --> 41:21.509
If we panic, we've lost,

41:21.511 --> 41:23.444
and if we lose,

41:23.446 --> 41:25.946
I don't know what that
will mean for the king.

41:25.948 --> 41:27.949
Cupcake, I found him.

41:27.951 --> 41:29.283
I found the king.

41:29.285 --> 41:32.018
Where, Fairy?
Where is he?

41:32.020 --> 41:35.123
He's been taken prisoner
by the evil goblins.

41:35.125 --> 41:37.958
King Frown
has taken our King Basil.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.893
No!

41:39.895 --> 41:42.062
He's the meanest goblin ever.

41:42.064 --> 41:44.866
Princess, consider us
under your command.

41:44.868 --> 41:46.167
What can we do?

41:46.169 --> 41:49.337
That's kind of you, Leaf.
Thank you.

41:49.339 --> 41:53.107
But I've never faced
magic like this before.

41:53.109 --> 41:55.779
I don't

41:59.082 --> 42:01.449
Princess, if I may,

42:01.451 --> 42:05.953
I know someone who may
be able to assist us.

42:05.955 --> 42:08.156
Tell us, Fairy Pie.
Who?

42:08.158 --> 42:11.259
His name is
Sage of the Enchanted Forest.

42:11.261 --> 42:16.062
His foresight and white magic
are some of the best around.

42:16.064 --> 42:18.199
All right.
Where can we find him?

42:18.201 --> 42:22.402
He resides in the Land of Sages.

42:22.404 --> 42:24.938
The Land of Sages?
Is that far?

42:24.940 --> 42:26.507
Do I need to go pack snacks?

42:26.509 --> 42:29.976
Bellyrumble,
now is not the time.

42:29.978 --> 42:32.446
Any time is a good time
for a snack.

42:32.448 --> 42:36.350
Leaf, Bellyrumble,
go to the Land of Sages

42:36.352 --> 42:39.252
and find the Sage
of the Enchanted Forest.

42:39.254 --> 42:41.221
See if he can help us.

42:41.223 --> 42:44.958
Meanwhile, Fairy Pie and I
will find the goblins

42:44.960 --> 42:47.194
and, hopefully, my father.

42:47.196 --> 42:49.230
Deal.
And don't worry, Princess.

42:49.232 --> 42:50.832
We'll get him back.

42:50.834 --> 42:53.000
Hey. I skipped breakfast
this morning.

42:53.002 --> 42:56.036
I really think we ought to grab
some snacks before we go.

42:56.038 --> 42:57.370
For our energy.

42:57.372 --> 42:58.873
Okay, Belly, okay.

42:58.875 --> 43:00.174
We'll get snacks.

43:00.176 --> 43:01.975
Come on.
Time's a-wasting.

43:01.977 --> 43:05.513
If we lose contact,
we'll meet back here.

43:05.515 --> 43:09.850
Troll-speed, and good luck.

43:29.906 --> 43:32.172
Welcome, King.

43:32.174 --> 43:35.877
Or should I say "Ex-King"?

43:35.879 --> 43:38.011
King Frown.

43:38.013 --> 43:40.080
I should have known you were

43:40.082 --> 43:43.216
behind the plot
against our kingdom.

43:43.218 --> 43:46.386
Oh, but that's where
you're wrong, Basil.

43:47.890 --> 43:49.957
I am but a cog in the wheel

43:49.959 --> 43:53.928
that has run
right over your troll throne.

43:53.930 --> 43:57.565
The real enemy
is one of your own.

43:57.567 --> 43:59.533
Don't tell me.

43:59.535 --> 44:02.603
Wee Grunt is to blame.

44:02.605 --> 44:04.504
Why, yes.

44:04.506 --> 44:07.440
It seems you're not
as bewildered as you look.

44:07.442 --> 44:12.647
Save it for a troll
that was born yesterday, goblin.

44:12.649 --> 44:17.284
You expect me to believe
that... that little troll

44:17.286 --> 44:23.056
cast a complicated
multidimensional evil spell

44:23.058 --> 44:28.062
to overthrow his own kingdom
and steal my throne?

44:28.064 --> 44:29.496
Yes.

44:29.498 --> 44:32.065
And do what?

44:32.067 --> 44:38.371
He can't even spell words, much
less wield high-level magic.

44:38.373 --> 44:43.044
Well, he did, but that's
not all Grunt's up to, Basil.

44:43.046 --> 44:45.413
He made me a promise.

44:45.415 --> 44:47.647
A deal, if you will.

44:47.649 --> 44:52.252
And I'm here to collect
from you.

44:52.254 --> 44:53.687
Collect what?

44:53.689 --> 44:57.491
Cupcake's little troll hand

44:57.493 --> 45:01.064
in marriage.

45:11.207 --> 45:15.475
Oh, Fairy Pie,
I'm trying not to despair,

45:15.477 --> 45:18.478
but I don't know that
we're doing the right thing.

45:18.480 --> 45:21.515
The Goblin Kingdom
isn't easy to find.

45:21.517 --> 45:25.585
We could search all day
and night and never find it.

45:25.587 --> 45:28.522
Cupcake, we must have faith.

45:28.524 --> 45:31.625
Where there's a will,
there's always a way.

45:31.627 --> 45:33.426
The king of the Woodland Elves

45:33.428 --> 45:36.330
can help us gain entry
to the Goblin Kingdom.

45:36.332 --> 45:39.100
He's an old friend.

45:39.102 --> 45:40.467
Really?

45:40.469 --> 45:42.670
Fairy, that's wonderful.

45:42.672 --> 45:44.605
Where can we find him?

45:44.607 --> 45:47.308
Well, the lairs
of the Woodland Elves

45:47.310 --> 45:50.277
aren't as obvious
as other kings' and queens'.

45:50.279 --> 45:51.478
We'll need help.

45:51.480 --> 45:54.047
Oh, Fairy!

45:54.049 --> 45:55.348
Don't fret, Cupcake.

45:55.350 --> 45:58.685
We have
the best help imaginable...

45:58.687 --> 46:03.457
the wise oracle Thorn!

46:03.459 --> 46:06.594
And where do we find
this wise oracle?

46:06.596 --> 46:08.194
That's easy.

46:08.196 --> 46:10.797
Thorn lives in the Land of No.

46:10.799 --> 46:13.333
You want to ask
for the most important favor

46:13.335 --> 46:16.469
we'll ever ask
in the Land of No?

46:16.471 --> 46:18.138
Yes.

46:18.140 --> 46:21.074
I don't know about this,
Fairy Pie.

46:21.076 --> 46:23.076
I do.
Come on, Princess.

46:23.078 --> 46:24.111
It's not far.

46:24.113 --> 46:26.350
We'll be there in no time.

46:30.152 --> 46:33.453
Here we are, Belly,
the Land of Sages.

46:33.455 --> 46:36.290
Hmm.
Nothing special about it.

46:36.292 --> 46:39.060
Huh?!
What was that?!

46:39.062 --> 46:41.429
Probably a squirrel
or something. I don't know.

46:41.431 --> 46:43.263
What if we're being followed?

46:43.265 --> 46:45.498
- By who?
- I don't know.

46:45.500 --> 46:47.400
Just a spy
or something like that...

46:47.402 --> 46:51.071
with poison darts just waiting
for a clear shot at us.

46:51.073 --> 46:53.574
Eek.
We ought to cover our heads.

46:53.576 --> 46:56.109
Belly, your imagination's
running wild.

46:56.111 --> 46:57.478
Like troll-mania.

46:57.480 --> 46:59.547
Keep your eyes open.

46:59.549 --> 47:02.449
The Sage of the Enchanted Forest
can't be far.

47:02.451 --> 47:05.453
Leaf, what if he gets mad?

47:05.455 --> 47:07.221
Mad at us?

47:07.223 --> 47:08.422
Yeah.

47:08.424 --> 47:10.156
What's there to be mad about?

47:10.158 --> 47:13.159
We'll just explain our situation
and ask for his help.

47:13.161 --> 47:14.594
If he says no, he says no.

47:14.596 --> 47:16.663
If he gets mad, oh, well.

47:16.665 --> 47:18.232
"Oh, well"?

47:18.234 --> 47:20.667
He's a powerful
white-magic sorcerer.

47:20.669 --> 47:22.502
What if he doesn't want us here?

47:22.504 --> 47:24.804
There's nothing
we can do about it now.

47:24.806 --> 47:27.174
We're here.
Keep an eye out.

47:27.176 --> 47:29.712
Oh, that's reassuring.

47:37.719 --> 47:41.355
Look at this place, Scorch.

47:41.357 --> 47:43.790
It's got good bones.

47:43.792 --> 47:45.725
Bones?
Where?

47:45.727 --> 47:48.629
I love bones.

47:48.631 --> 47:52.333
Oh, I don't mean literally,
you scaly overgrown lizard.

47:52.335 --> 47:54.335
I mean the place has potential.

47:54.337 --> 47:58.705
And just as soon
as I assume Basil's throne,

47:58.707 --> 48:01.542
these streets, these huts,

48:01.544 --> 48:04.545
and all these trolls
will belong to me.

48:08.783 --> 48:11.851
Scorch, you're supposed
to breathe fire. Remember?

48:11.853 --> 48:13.355
Oh, yeah.

48:26.801 --> 48:28.669
We're almost there now, Cupcake.

48:28.671 --> 48:31.404
We can find Thorn
just up ahead.

48:31.406 --> 48:34.775
Are you sure he'll give us
the answers we seek?

48:34.777 --> 48:37.877
He's never let me down
whenever I've needed him.

48:37.879 --> 48:40.948
I can't imagine he'll start now
when we need him most.

48:40.950 --> 48:42.949
Let me get this straight.

48:42.951 --> 48:45.185
One of your fellow trolls

48:45.187 --> 48:49.690
mastered the Mighty Spell
of the Dreary Put-downs

48:49.692 --> 48:53.826
and used it
to abduct King Basil?

48:53.828 --> 48:56.496
That's it in a nutshell, Thorn.

48:56.498 --> 48:59.400
Sounds familiar.

48:59.402 --> 49:02.870
Well, you're in
quite the conundrum, it seems.

49:02.872 --> 49:05.806
- Right.
- I assume you've come to me

49:05.808 --> 49:08.908
for some type of assistance
in this matter.

49:08.910 --> 49:13.246
Thorn, my father is being held
captive in the Goblin Kingdom.

49:13.248 --> 49:16.650
We plan to go there and bring
him home, where he belongs.

49:16.652 --> 49:21.589
In the Goblin Kingdom, eh?

49:21.591 --> 49:24.891
You make it sound easy,
Princess.

49:24.893 --> 49:26.826
Is it not so?

49:26.828 --> 49:29.996
Well, it's not
exactly like strolling

49:29.998 --> 49:32.933
into Bed Bath & Beyond.

49:32.935 --> 49:34.935
Thorn, Fairy Pie recommended you

49:34.937 --> 49:36.904
to point us
to the Goblin Kingdom.

49:36.906 --> 49:40.674
If you could just get us there,
we'll do the rest.

49:40.676 --> 49:43.944
Say no more, fair princess.

49:43.946 --> 49:45.645
Oh, thank you.

49:45.647 --> 49:48.482
If you could lend
any assistance in our quest,

49:48.484 --> 49:50.650
we'd be forever indebted.

49:50.652 --> 49:54.788
What you ask is possible,

49:54.790 --> 49:58.926
but there's no easy route

49:58.928 --> 50:02.029
to the Goblin Kingdom, trolls.

50:02.031 --> 50:07.433
Any path you choose
is fraught with its own perils.

50:07.435 --> 50:09.536
We understand, Thorn,
but we're willing

50:09.538 --> 50:12.373
to face those perils
for our king.

50:12.375 --> 50:14.275
Ooh!

50:14.277 --> 50:17.044
Every monarch should be so lucky

50:17.046 --> 50:21.748
as to have such devoted minions
as you.

50:21.750 --> 50:25.351
Travel through
the Land of Icicle and Thorns

50:25.353 --> 50:28.489
to find
the king of the Woodland Elves.

50:28.491 --> 50:31.625
But be warned.

50:31.627 --> 50:36.562
This land is very dangerous,
and the Woodland Elves' king

50:36.564 --> 50:40.967
was just robbed of his insults
by the goblins.

50:40.969 --> 50:45.973
He may not be receptive
to anything goblin.

50:45.975 --> 50:49.542
That could work in our favor,
though, right?

50:49.544 --> 50:55.415
Theoretically, but you won't
know by talking to the king.

50:55.417 --> 50:58.384
Since the goblins
stole his insults,

50:58.386 --> 51:01.821
he can only say nice things,

51:01.823 --> 51:05.058
even if he doesn't mean them.

51:05.060 --> 51:07.027
Wow.

51:07.029 --> 51:09.529
Thank you for the insight,
old friend.

51:09.531 --> 51:11.799
You have yet to let me down.

51:11.801 --> 51:17.370
Anything for the fairest
Fairy Pie in the land.

51:17.372 --> 51:19.406
Oh, thank you, Thorn.

51:19.408 --> 51:22.076
You're very welcome.

51:22.078 --> 51:25.978
Before you go, Princess,
I'd like to share something

51:25.980 --> 51:28.748
I'm not sure you're aware of.

51:28.750 --> 51:31.417
Oh? Yes?

51:31.419 --> 51:36.989
Your troll ancestors
were strong with magic.

51:36.991 --> 51:41.462
Part of their strengths
were sugar and nice,

51:41.464 --> 51:44.964
condensed and directed powers
of positivity

51:44.966 --> 51:49.469
that could thwart
any insult thrown their way.

51:49.471 --> 51:53.741
Indeed, they were
largely impervious to threats

51:53.743 --> 51:58.879
such as the Mighty Spell
of the Dreary Put-downs.

51:58.881 --> 52:00.748
I never knew.

52:00.750 --> 52:03.116
Well, now you know,

52:03.118 --> 52:09.089
and, Princess, you possess
these powers, as well.

52:09.091 --> 52:14.661
They live inside you to be
summoned whenever you need them.

52:14.663 --> 52:16.830
Remember this,

52:16.832 --> 52:21.902
should you ever find yourself
threatened or under attack.

52:21.904 --> 52:23.870
Thank you, Thorn.

52:23.872 --> 52:26.640
Any time, Princess.

52:26.642 --> 52:30.113
Sure thing, Thorn.
Talk soon.

52:34.716 --> 52:38.919
He kidnapped your king?

52:38.921 --> 52:42.823
Why, that devious little runt.

52:42.825 --> 52:45.426
- Ha!
- We've come to you

52:45.428 --> 52:47.161
for your wisdom
and for your help, Sage.

52:47.163 --> 52:49.462
What can we do to save our king?

52:49.464 --> 52:54.567
There's precious little
recourse, I'm afraid.

52:54.569 --> 52:57.770
- What's that mean?
- Shush.

52:57.772 --> 53:02.643
The spell of which you speak
will not be broken

53:02.645 --> 53:06.513
by any traditional means,

53:06.515 --> 53:13.620
especially if you have no access
to your overthrown king.

53:13.622 --> 53:17.024
Only potent counter-magic

53:17.026 --> 53:22.462
can undo
what has already been done.

53:22.464 --> 53:24.565
Thank you for the advice, Sage,

53:24.567 --> 53:28.234
- but we don't know magic.
- That's true.

53:28.236 --> 53:30.471
I've never cast a spell
in my life.

53:30.473 --> 53:36.844
Uh, magic will never yield
its results for a novice,

53:36.846 --> 53:39.612
unsightly creatures.

53:39.614 --> 53:42.114
The action you seek

53:42.116 --> 53:46.920
requires high-level sorcery.

53:46.922 --> 53:50.123
Uh, well, that pretty
much disqualifies us.

53:50.125 --> 53:54.895
Granted,
though it may disqualify you,

53:54.897 --> 53:58.632
your mission is not lost.

53:58.634 --> 54:01.534
- It's not?
- Carry on

54:01.536 --> 54:06.672
and locate
the Blackthorn Tree Fairies.

54:06.674 --> 54:11.745
They, and they alone,
hold mastery

54:11.747 --> 54:17.049
of the Good Deed Spell
of the Blackthorn Forest.

54:17.051 --> 54:18.551
Mm, I don't know.

54:18.553 --> 54:20.254
That sounds pretty high-level
to me.

54:20.256 --> 54:21.654
What's the difference?

54:21.656 --> 54:23.924
Shush.
Let him talk.

54:23.926 --> 54:28.795
Only with this spell
can you drive back

54:28.797 --> 54:34.067
the Mighty Spell
of the Dreary Put-downs

54:34.069 --> 54:39.239
and return your troll king
to his throne...

54:39.241 --> 54:44.044
provided he has not
already met his fate.

54:44.046 --> 54:46.245
Oh, no.
What fate is that?

54:46.247 --> 54:53.754
The catacombs
of the Goblin Kingdom.

54:53.756 --> 54:55.755
Sh... Shoo!

54:55.757 --> 54:57.156
Go away, rodent.

54:57.158 --> 54:59.893
- Leave me be.
- Shoo yourself.

54:59.895 --> 55:02.995
Don't pull that king routine
on me, prisoner.

55:02.997 --> 55:05.265
We're all in the same boat
down here.

55:05.267 --> 55:06.833
Sorcery?

55:06.835 --> 55:10.571
What new magic do I now face?

55:10.573 --> 55:12.272
Ah, you're so dramatic.

55:12.274 --> 55:14.241
Give it a rest, why don't you?

55:14.243 --> 55:18.245
Your voice sounds familiar,
rodent.

55:18.247 --> 55:20.813
It should.
You've dealt with me for years.

55:20.815 --> 55:23.951
When the both of us wore crowns.

55:23.953 --> 55:26.118
Who are you?

55:26.120 --> 55:31.324
King Chomps, ex-leader of the
Goblin Kingdom, at your service.

55:31.326 --> 55:33.859
Chomps?

55:33.861 --> 55:35.696
But how did...

55:35.698 --> 55:38.297
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it all the time.

55:38.299 --> 55:40.967
"How did you go from being
the most powerful king

55:40.969 --> 55:43.002
in the land"...
no offense, Basil...

55:43.004 --> 55:45.906
"to a dungeon rat
in your own kingdom?"

55:45.908 --> 55:49.241
- Well?
- That creep King Frown

55:49.243 --> 55:52.846
waited till my guard was down,
then overthrew me with a spell

55:52.848 --> 55:55.348
that turned me
from the handsome goblin I was

55:55.350 --> 55:58.752
into, uh, this.

55:58.754 --> 56:00.853
But why?

56:00.855 --> 56:04.725
Power, prestige,
fair goblin maidens.

56:04.727 --> 56:06.359
Do we ever really know why?

56:06.361 --> 56:07.828
What's done is done.

56:07.830 --> 56:09.862
Now here I am.

56:09.864 --> 56:14.701
Aye, and here I am,
alongside you.

56:14.703 --> 56:17.170
At least you're still a troll.

56:17.172 --> 56:20.373
I mean, ordinarily, that
wouldn't be such a good thing,

56:20.375 --> 56:22.308
but, you know.

56:22.310 --> 56:26.980
- Yeah, Chomps, I know.
- To each their own.

56:26.982 --> 56:30.750
Anyway, welcome to
the notorious goblin catacombs.

56:30.752 --> 56:32.986
Get as comfortable as you can.

56:32.988 --> 56:34.888
You're gonna be here awhile.

56:34.890 --> 56:37.156
Who says?

56:37.158 --> 56:39.225
King Frown, of course.

56:39.227 --> 56:43.129
Sounds like you have a bone
to pick with him, Chomps.

56:43.131 --> 56:45.931
- You know it.
- And you came out

56:45.933 --> 56:48.902
of that hole in the wall
over there.

56:48.904 --> 56:51.772
Where does it lead?

56:51.774 --> 56:53.940
The bowels of the catacombs.

56:53.942 --> 56:57.444
And can I fit through there?

56:57.446 --> 57:00.681
Not unless you've got
a hammer and chisel, big boy.

57:00.683 --> 57:02.382
Oh, well, I don't,

57:02.384 --> 57:06.252
but like you said,
I do have time.

57:06.254 --> 57:07.953
That you do.

57:07.955 --> 57:11.692
Chomps, will you help me
get out of here

57:11.694 --> 57:17.397
if I help you reverse that spell
and reclaim your throne?

57:17.399 --> 57:20.167
Because you're an expert wizard?

57:20.169 --> 57:23.703
If you were, you wouldn't be
stuck down here with me.

57:23.705 --> 57:28.408
I'm no wizard, but there
are trolls looking for me,

57:28.410 --> 57:32.446
and sooner or later,
they will find me.

57:32.448 --> 57:36.248
Then we'll have
strength in numbers.

57:36.250 --> 57:39.219
Uh-huh.

57:39.221 --> 57:41.987
I've heard that one before.

57:41.989 --> 57:43.089
Tell you what.

57:43.091 --> 57:44.991
Let me know when they get here.

57:44.993 --> 57:46.826
I'm gonna get back to me nap.

57:48.797 --> 57:51.364
Oh. Do me a favor
and keep it down, yeah?

57:51.366 --> 57:54.734
No screaming or hollering
till at least your second week.

57:54.736 --> 57:57.136
I have established
a balance around here.

57:59.274 --> 58:03.210
Like I said,
they're going to find me.

58:03.212 --> 58:04.745
Think about it.

58:04.747 --> 58:07.214
Okay, troll.
See you in the morning.

58:07.216 --> 58:09.348
And don't snore, all right?

58:09.350 --> 58:11.417
I can't stand snoring.

58:26.100 --> 58:28.835
Oh, Leaf, this was a bad idea.

58:28.837 --> 58:31.804
I've heard terrible things
about Blackthorn Forest.

58:31.806 --> 58:33.440
Yeah? Like what?

58:33.442 --> 58:36.275
Mm, I can't think
of anything right now.

58:36.277 --> 58:37.844
I'm too hungry.

58:37.846 --> 58:40.513
Uh-huh. Hmm.

58:40.515 --> 58:43.183
Sounds to me like
that's your problem.

58:43.185 --> 58:46.886
I bet if we get some snacks
in that belly of yours,

58:46.888 --> 58:49.890
- you'll mellow right out.
- Snacks?

58:49.892 --> 58:52.158
Do we have any more?
I'm famished.

58:52.160 --> 58:53.794
Just a little further,
Bellyrumble,

58:53.796 --> 58:55.962
and I promise...
As soon as we're done,

58:55.964 --> 58:57.196
we'll feast all night.

58:57.198 --> 58:59.901
I'm gonna hold you to that,
Leaf.

59:19.053 --> 59:22.989
Stop right where you are,
cutie pies.

59:22.991 --> 59:26.158
That's <i>Fairy</i> Pie to you,
stranger.

59:26.160 --> 59:29.462
Whatever you say, mosquito.

59:29.464 --> 59:31.565
What did you... What did you...
What? What?

59:31.567 --> 59:34.433
Wait!
Why, you...

59:34.435 --> 59:37.203
Don't pay him any mind,
Fairy Pie.

59:37.205 --> 59:39.873
He's just trying
to get under your skin.

59:39.875 --> 59:43.009
I'll have you know,
I'm a fairy godmother,

59:43.011 --> 59:45.478
and she's a troll princess.

59:45.480 --> 59:48.080
So there, you... you beast.

59:48.082 --> 59:49.616
Beast? Oh.

59:49.618 --> 59:52.455
I prefer Grubhead.

59:53.154 --> 59:58.257
So, what are you two cutie pies
doing around these parts?

59:58.259 --> 01:00:02.629
Are you lost?

01:00:02.631 --> 01:00:05.431
We're on our way to see
the king of the Woodland Elves,

01:00:05.433 --> 01:00:07.199
if you must know.

01:00:07.201 --> 01:00:09.335
Oh!

01:00:09.337 --> 01:00:13.005
Highfalutin, are we?

01:00:13.007 --> 01:00:18.444
And which way are we headed,
if I may ask?

01:00:18.446 --> 01:00:20.246
That's our business.

01:00:20.248 --> 01:00:26.018
Hey, I'm just asking because
there's more than one way

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:28.020
to reach the king.

01:00:28.022 --> 01:00:29.922
Oh, yeah?

01:00:29.924 --> 01:00:33.058
And no matter which way you go,

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:37.630
you will get lost
without my help.

01:00:37.632 --> 01:00:41.433
These are my lands.

01:00:41.435 --> 01:00:45.571
Oh, yeah? We know every single
way to reach the king.

01:00:45.573 --> 01:00:47.207
Thank you very much.

01:00:47.209 --> 01:00:49.442
We don't need your help.

01:00:49.444 --> 01:00:52.178
Aha!
I caught you.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:56.082
I knew you were lying to me.

01:00:56.084 --> 01:01:02.656
There's only one way to reach
the king of the Woodland Elves.

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:04.690
Okay.
You got us.

01:01:04.692 --> 01:01:08.661
We're lost, and it's so cold.

01:01:08.663 --> 01:01:11.598
We've come all the way from
the Kingdom of the Wee Trolls

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.067
to rescue my father, King Basil.

01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:17.036
He's being held prisoner
in the Goblin Kingdom,

01:01:17.038 --> 01:01:19.272
and we need the king
of the Woodland Elves' help

01:01:19.274 --> 01:01:20.674
to bring him home.

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.375
Are you kidding me?

01:01:22.377 --> 01:01:25.478
That's the plot of a soap opera.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.315
She's not kidding you,
and we're running out of time.

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:29.982
Can you help us,
whatever you are,

01:01:29.984 --> 01:01:31.618
or do we have to go around you

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.453
after I punch you in the nose?

01:01:33.455 --> 01:01:37.223
Oh, I'll help you.

01:01:37.225 --> 01:01:41.361
If you solve my riddle, that is.

01:01:41.363 --> 01:01:43.596
Your riddle?

01:01:43.598 --> 01:01:45.565
Yep.

01:01:45.567 --> 01:01:48.335
Solve my riddle,

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:53.142
and I'll get you
where you want to go.

01:01:53.741 --> 01:01:58.411
But fail or refuse,

01:01:58.413 --> 01:02:01.114
and lose your way here

01:02:01.116 --> 01:02:04.750
amid the icicles and thorns...

01:02:04.752 --> 01:02:08.321
forever.

01:02:08.323 --> 01:02:11.424
I knew it.
You're a warlock.

01:02:11.426 --> 01:02:15.428
I'm a businessman

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:18.531
with a little magic wager.

01:02:18.533 --> 01:02:20.667
That's all.

01:02:20.669 --> 01:02:24.237
We're wasting time,
and we're lost.

01:02:24.239 --> 01:02:27.172
Okay.
What's your riddle?

01:02:27.174 --> 01:02:33.645
"When I grow,
I get closer to the ground.

01:02:33.647 --> 01:02:36.315
What am I?"

01:02:36.317 --> 01:02:39.051
I can't believe
you agreed to this, Cupcake.

01:02:39.053 --> 01:02:42.321
Hush, tsetse fly.

01:02:42.323 --> 01:02:45.391
Bah! You!
Quiet, ugly thing.

01:02:45.393 --> 01:02:47.493
Quiet, both of you.

01:02:47.495 --> 01:02:53.665
"When I grow,
I get closer to the ground."

01:02:53.667 --> 01:02:55.167
An icicle.

01:02:55.169 --> 01:02:57.536
It's an icicle, right?

01:02:57.538 --> 01:03:00.040
Oh! Right.

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:02.141
Of course.

01:03:02.143 --> 01:03:04.643
Oh, fine.

01:03:04.645 --> 01:03:06.379
You guessed it.

01:03:06.381 --> 01:03:09.248
Head 1 mile that way.

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:13.085
And watch out
for the thornbushes.

01:03:13.087 --> 01:03:15.154
See you 'round, parasite.

01:03:15.156 --> 01:03:19.558
I don't know
what you're so happy about.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:24.630
- <i>You</i> didn't solve it, gnat.
- Worm.

01:03:24.632 --> 01:03:30.170
You want to try your hand
at another riddle?

01:03:30.172 --> 01:03:31.703
Double or nothing.

01:03:31.705 --> 01:03:35.141
Come on.
I dare you.

01:03:35.143 --> 01:03:36.676
In your dreams.

01:03:36.678 --> 01:03:39.212
I didn't think so.

01:03:39.214 --> 01:03:44.850
Scram before I find
my bug spray.

01:03:44.852 --> 01:03:47.719
Don't worry, live bait.
We're leaving.

01:03:47.721 --> 01:03:50.457
Have fun with the icicles
and your thorns.

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:52.225
Enough, Fairy Pie.

01:03:52.227 --> 01:03:54.129
Let's go.

01:04:29.598 --> 01:04:33.399
Say, are you a fairy
from the Land of Lard?

01:04:33.401 --> 01:04:35.601
Nope.
I'm Blackthorn fairy.

01:04:35.603 --> 01:04:37.569
Blackthorn fairy!

01:04:37.571 --> 01:04:39.705
Exactly who we're looking for.

01:04:39.707 --> 01:04:42.609
Can we have a word
with you, kind fairy?

01:04:42.611 --> 01:04:44.476
My name's Boobooroo.

01:04:44.478 --> 01:04:45.844
What's the word?

01:04:45.846 --> 01:04:47.779
Got any snacks?

01:04:47.781 --> 01:04:49.649
Uh, that's three words.

01:04:49.651 --> 01:04:51.451
Try "rescue."

01:04:51.453 --> 01:04:54.219
Boobooroo, we're from
the Kingdom of the Wee Trolls,

01:04:54.221 --> 01:04:58.223
and our king's been taken
prisoner in the Goblin Kingdom.

01:04:58.225 --> 01:05:00.859
The only thing that can counter
the spell that took him

01:05:00.861 --> 01:05:03.196
is your Good Deed Spell of...

01:05:03.198 --> 01:05:05.632
- The Blackthorn Forest.
- Yes!

01:05:05.634 --> 01:05:07.600
No.

01:05:07.602 --> 01:05:09.701
Wait. What?

01:05:09.703 --> 01:05:11.703
The Good Deed Spell
of the Blackthorn Forest

01:05:11.705 --> 01:05:13.806
is far too powerful
to be wielded by anyone

01:05:13.808 --> 01:05:15.775
other than
Blackthorn Tree Fairies.

01:05:15.777 --> 01:05:18.710
And definitely not trolls.

01:05:18.712 --> 01:05:22.415
Hey! I'm a fairy
from the Great Land of Lard.

01:05:22.417 --> 01:05:24.750
Boobooroo, please.
We need magic

01:05:24.752 --> 01:05:27.353
to reverse the magic
that kidnapped our king.

01:05:27.355 --> 01:05:29.621
Guess you should have
learned some spells, then.

01:05:29.623 --> 01:05:32.257
The Good Deed Spell wouldn't do
you any good, anyway.

01:05:32.259 --> 01:05:34.194
Why not?

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:35.962
Because even if you mastered it,

01:05:35.964 --> 01:05:38.397
it only works here
in the Blackthorn Forest.

01:05:38.399 --> 01:05:40.966
Like the name says,
silly trolls.

01:05:40.968 --> 01:05:44.205
Hey, I'm not a troll.

01:05:50.377 --> 01:05:52.946
And I'll put a sausage grinder
over there

01:05:52.948 --> 01:05:55.748
and a blacksmith over there,

01:05:55.750 --> 01:06:00.719
and we'll host jousts over there
to settle any citizen disputes.

01:06:00.721 --> 01:06:04.556
I know how to run the kingdom.

01:06:04.558 --> 01:06:06.859
When I'm in charge,
this place will be the model

01:06:06.861 --> 01:06:08.895
for every kingdom around it

01:06:08.897 --> 01:06:11.330
from now till the end of time.

01:06:12.634 --> 01:06:17.870
Oh, that's a long time.

01:06:17.872 --> 01:06:19.973
That's forever, you rube.

01:06:19.975 --> 01:06:22.741
Oh, right.

01:06:22.743 --> 01:06:25.678
When is this plan
gonna take place?

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:30.283
I'm biding my time,
watching who's doing what.

01:06:30.285 --> 01:06:32.317
When I've got
a good feel for things,

01:06:32.319 --> 01:06:35.621
we'll announce me
as the new king.

01:06:35.623 --> 01:06:41.560
Once that happens, there will be
no more mingling incognito.

01:06:41.562 --> 01:06:44.964
This is a golden time, Scorch.

01:06:44.966 --> 01:06:48.500
The calm before the storm.

01:06:48.502 --> 01:06:53.438
Uh, you know
there's a spell out there

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.741
that could override yours,

01:06:55.743 --> 01:06:57.777
- right?
- What spell?

01:06:57.779 --> 01:07:02.714
The Good Deed Spell
of the Blackthorn Forest.

01:07:02.716 --> 01:07:05.752
The Good Deed.

01:07:05.754 --> 01:07:09.491
Why didn't
you mention this before?

01:07:10.491 --> 01:07:12.458
Oh, you know what?

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.759
Never mind.

01:07:13.761 --> 01:07:15.728
I don't care.

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:18.931
We'll do what any
forward-thinking ruthless leader

01:07:18.933 --> 01:07:24.069
would do and burn down
the Blackthorn Forest.

01:07:26.774 --> 01:07:30.745
Get your fire breath ready,
dragon.

01:07:34.815 --> 01:07:36.748
Our king lives here.

01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:39.384
He has precautions
against unannounced visitors,

01:07:39.386 --> 01:07:41.821
but if you can get past them,
he'll speak with you.

01:07:41.823 --> 01:07:43.955
Wait just a second.
Precautions?

01:07:43.957 --> 01:07:45.558
What kind of precautions?

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.527
I'm not allowed to say.

01:07:47.529 --> 01:07:48.960
Fairy rules.

01:07:48.962 --> 01:07:50.629
What happens
in Blackthorn Forest

01:07:50.631 --> 01:07:52.765
stays in Blackthorn Forest.

01:07:52.767 --> 01:07:55.368
Thank you, Boobooroo,
for bringing us here

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:56.969
and at least giving us a chance.

01:07:56.971 --> 01:07:58.770
Hey, don't mention it, troll.

01:07:58.772 --> 01:08:00.906
Be careful, and good luck.

01:08:00.908 --> 01:08:03.975
Leaf, should we really do this?

01:08:03.977 --> 01:08:05.911
We're not turning back now,
Belly.

01:08:05.913 --> 01:08:06.978
Come on.

01:08:10.618 --> 01:08:13.719
Hey, Leaf,
do you feel what I feel?

01:08:13.721 --> 01:08:16.388
Hmm. Yes.

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:22.361
All of a sudden,
I feel very happy.

01:08:22.363 --> 01:08:23.694
Me too.

01:08:23.697 --> 01:08:26.665
Hmm.
Do you think that...

01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:28.901
We're sensing the power
of the Good Deed Spell

01:08:28.903 --> 01:08:30.502
of the Blackthorn Forest.

01:08:30.505 --> 01:08:32.069
Halt, creatures.

01:08:32.072 --> 01:08:33.638
Hi, there.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:36.642
Hi, yourself, trespasser.

01:08:36.644 --> 01:08:38.777
No.
Boobooroo sent us.

01:08:38.779 --> 01:08:40.511
We're no trespassers.

01:08:40.514 --> 01:08:43.415
I'll be the judge of that.

01:08:43.417 --> 01:08:45.618
I'm Bumblestick the Fairy,

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:47.953
gatekeeper
of the king's quarters.

01:08:47.956 --> 01:08:50.490
He has a guard
for his coin collection?

01:08:50.492 --> 01:08:52.057
He must have a lot of quarters.

01:08:52.059 --> 01:08:54.393
Never mind, Belly.

01:08:54.395 --> 01:08:56.495
We're here to see the king.

01:08:56.497 --> 01:08:59.432
Huh.
Oh, okay.

01:08:59.434 --> 01:09:01.834
Right this way.

01:09:01.836 --> 01:09:04.169
Wow.
That was easy.

01:09:04.171 --> 01:09:07.471
Shh.
She's being sarcastic.

01:09:07.474 --> 01:09:08.874
Oh.

01:09:08.876 --> 01:09:11.944
What do you think this is...
troll charity?

01:09:11.946 --> 01:09:15.481
You're in the lair of the
Blackthorn Tree Fairies' king.

01:09:15.483 --> 01:09:16.649
We come in peace.

01:09:16.651 --> 01:09:17.850
Our kingdom's under attack,

01:09:17.852 --> 01:09:19.718
and your people can help us.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.053
Is that so?

01:09:22.055 --> 01:09:24.923
What are you offering in return,
creatures?

01:09:24.925 --> 01:09:27.826
Our eternal gratitude?

01:09:27.828 --> 01:09:32.663
Ha! You've come to
the wrong place for handouts.

01:09:32.666 --> 01:09:37.169
But we may be able
to have a little fun.

01:09:37.171 --> 01:09:40.005
Fun?
Oh, I'd love some fun.

01:09:40.006 --> 01:09:41.774
This is getting too serious.

01:09:41.776 --> 01:09:43.676
Answer my riddle,

01:09:43.678 --> 01:09:46.478
and I'll grant you
a moment with our king.

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:48.113
But fail,

01:09:48.116 --> 01:09:51.651
and I'll banish you
to wander the Blackthorn Forest

01:09:51.653 --> 01:09:53.852
for the rest of your days.

01:09:55.489 --> 01:09:58.557
Uh, that doesn't sound fun.

01:09:58.559 --> 01:10:01.694
Straight deal, just like I said.

01:10:01.696 --> 01:10:02.895
You're on.

01:10:02.897 --> 01:10:04.530
Leaf!

01:10:04.532 --> 01:10:06.999
Now we're talking.

01:10:09.203 --> 01:10:12.771
"What does a tree do
when it's ready to go home?"

01:10:12.773 --> 01:10:14.673
Any ideas?

01:10:14.675 --> 01:10:16.709
I believe
I've made a grave mistake

01:10:16.711 --> 01:10:18.477
accepting this challenge, Belly.

01:10:18.479 --> 01:10:22.248
- Oh, how I wish we could leave.
- That's it!

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:26.017
"What does a tree do
when it's ready to go home?"

01:10:26.019 --> 01:10:29.155
It leaves.

01:10:32.026 --> 01:10:34.793
You did it, Belly!
You did it!

01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:38.063
I thought
fairies from the Land of Lard

01:10:38.065 --> 01:10:40.665
were supposed to be stupid.

01:10:40.667 --> 01:10:43.438
Fine.
Follow me.

01:10:54.515 --> 01:10:57.549
We haven't seen a thornbush
in about a mile.

01:10:57.551 --> 01:10:59.084
Oh, Fairy,

01:10:59.086 --> 01:11:01.620
the Woodland Elves' king
has to help us.

01:11:01.622 --> 01:11:05.191
- He just has to.
- Take heart, Princess.

01:11:05.193 --> 01:11:09.027
We need the power of your belief
now more than ever.

01:11:09.029 --> 01:11:11.129
Stop right there.

01:11:11.131 --> 01:11:13.665
What in tarnation is this?

01:11:13.667 --> 01:11:16.768
A troll maiden
and some kind of flea?

01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:18.704
A flea?
Why, you...

01:11:18.706 --> 01:11:21.039
Sir, we're running out of time.

01:11:21.041 --> 01:11:24.910
I'm Princess Cupcake from
the Kingdom of the Wee Trolls,

01:11:24.912 --> 01:11:27.980
and our land is in grave danger.

01:11:27.982 --> 01:11:29.949
Oh, whoa!

01:11:29.951 --> 01:11:31.784
Princess Cupcake,

01:11:31.786 --> 01:11:34.920
my little girl dressed up
as you for Halloween.

01:11:34.922 --> 01:11:37.757
She just loves you so much.

01:11:37.759 --> 01:11:40.258
She wants to be you
when she grows up.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.594
Oh, my.

01:11:42.596 --> 01:11:44.896
That's so sweet.

01:11:44.898 --> 01:11:46.332
My name's Pluck.

01:11:46.334 --> 01:11:48.767
I'm the king's right-hand elf.

01:11:48.769 --> 01:11:52.038
Hello.
It's nice to meet you, Pluck.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.839
Charmed. Listen, guard,
we're here to see your king.

01:11:54.841 --> 01:11:57.743
Can we dispense with
the niceties and chop-chop?

01:11:57.745 --> 01:12:00.111
Fairy! Be nice.

01:12:00.113 --> 01:12:02.315
Oh, go right ahead,

01:12:02.317 --> 01:12:06.218
but he doesn't really say
what he means lately.

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.620
An evil spell
robbed him of his insults,

01:12:08.622 --> 01:12:11.289
and, well, he's pretty nice.

01:12:11.291 --> 01:12:14.226
You see, the king's
usually pretty colorful

01:12:14.228 --> 01:12:17.062
with his language,
and now he's not,

01:12:17.064 --> 01:12:20.333
so you have to kind of
read between the lines.

01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:22.368
Thank you, Pluck.

01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:25.236
Don't mention it, Princess.

01:12:36.084 --> 01:12:37.883
Off you go, Scorch,

01:12:37.885 --> 01:12:40.953
and, remember, when you reach
the Blackthorn Forest,

01:12:40.955 --> 01:12:43.990
find me that Good Deed Spell,

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:48.160
and, once you have it,
burn that land to the dirt.

01:12:50.098 --> 01:12:54.303
Um yes, Grunt.

01:13:19.359 --> 01:13:24.230
Your story is a harrowing one
to say the least, young trolls.

01:13:24.232 --> 01:13:28.834
However, we speak truth only
in my chambers,

01:13:28.836 --> 01:13:31.070
and, Leaf,
I know the true reason

01:13:31.072 --> 01:13:33.705
you have embarked
upon this perilous quest.

01:13:33.707 --> 01:13:36.808
- You do?
- I do.

01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:40.245
It is your unspoken love
for the Princess Cupcake

01:13:40.247 --> 01:13:44.049
that has led you so far
from your homeland

01:13:44.051 --> 01:13:48.387
into the waiting jaws
of certain doom.

01:13:48.389 --> 01:13:50.789
Wait.
The what?

01:13:50.791 --> 01:13:52.357
Jaws of doom?

01:13:52.359 --> 01:13:54.160
That's not good.

01:13:54.162 --> 01:13:58.463
To be sure, love makes
creatures do strange things.

01:13:58.465 --> 01:14:00.700
You're not wrong in your quest.

01:14:00.702 --> 01:14:03.936
And your journey,
should you survive it,

01:14:03.938 --> 01:14:08.441
will only yield
newfound strength and wisdom.

01:14:08.443 --> 01:14:12.343
Gee. Again, though,
<i>"should</i> you survive"...

01:14:12.345 --> 01:14:14.446
I don't like the sound of that.

01:14:14.448 --> 01:14:18.750
Our Good Deed Spell
of the Blackthorn Forest

01:14:18.752 --> 01:14:23.755
can, indeed, thwart the Mighty
Spell of the Dreary Put-downs,

01:14:23.757 --> 01:14:27.860
but as you heard,
it is only applicable

01:14:27.862 --> 01:14:31.362
within the borders
of our lush woodlands.

01:14:31.364 --> 01:14:35.133
It cannot be transported
by an outsider,

01:14:35.135 --> 01:14:41.106
and, thus, I'm afraid it can do
you no good in enemy lands.

01:14:41.108 --> 01:14:42.842
Oh.

01:14:42.844 --> 01:14:46.177
But do not despair, young troll.

01:14:46.179 --> 01:14:47.512
That's just it, King.

01:14:47.514 --> 01:14:49.347
I haven't been despairing.

01:14:49.349 --> 01:14:53.017
But I'd say now is
a pretty good time to start.

01:14:53.019 --> 01:14:57.957
Leaf, listen to the wisdom
of an age-old king.

01:14:57.959 --> 01:14:59.792
Do not fall yet.

01:14:59.794 --> 01:15:04.929
The strength you've been
searching for resides within.

01:15:04.931 --> 01:15:08.968
Trust and believe
in your own innate power,

01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:11.837
and you will not fail.

01:15:11.839 --> 01:15:14.272
Do you understand?

01:15:14.274 --> 01:15:16.008
Yes.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.449
King, the dragon Scorch has
been sighted in forest airspace.

01:15:23.451 --> 01:15:27.887
His claws are bared,
and his nostrils are flaming.

01:15:27.889 --> 01:15:30.121
We're under attack!

01:15:33.193 --> 01:15:36.262

01:15:36.264 --> 01:15:38.263

01:15:51.845 --> 01:15:54.346
I can see the king's lair
up ahead.

01:15:54.348 --> 01:15:57.919
We're hoping he has a good heart
and shows mercy on our plight.

Welcome,
troll princess and, uh...

01:16:25.345 --> 01:16:27.312
sparrow.

01:16:27.314 --> 01:16:29.048
Fairy.

01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:31.049
This is Fairy Pie, King.

01:16:31.051 --> 01:16:33.017
She's my fairy godmother

01:16:33.019 --> 01:16:36.222
and companion on this
treacherous journey of ours.

01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:38.057
I see.

01:16:38.059 --> 01:16:40.959
And what brings
you wonderful creatures

01:16:40.961 --> 01:16:44.096
to my woods this lovely day?

01:16:44.098 --> 01:16:48.200
Our king, my father,
is in dire straits,

01:16:48.202 --> 01:16:51.136
and we wanted to ask a favor,
Your Highness.

01:16:51.138 --> 01:16:54.173
Oh? Go on.

01:16:54.175 --> 01:16:56.174
My father has been taken hostage

01:16:56.176 --> 01:16:58.509
through the casting
of an evil spell,

01:16:58.511 --> 01:17:01.914
and he's being held captive
in the Goblin Kingdom.

01:17:01.916 --> 01:17:04.650
And we want to enter the
Goblin Kingdom to rescue him.

01:17:04.652 --> 01:17:08.219
As a king yourself, I'm sure you
can appreciate our predicament.

01:17:08.221 --> 01:17:11.158
I certainly can.

01:17:11.992 --> 01:17:16.628
But the Goblin Kingdom
is a dangerous land.

01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:23.067
Surely no place for a princess
or a, uh, swallow.

01:17:23.069 --> 01:17:25.370
- Fairy.
- Ah.

01:17:25.372 --> 01:17:28.140
At any rate, the goblins

01:17:28.142 --> 01:17:31.442
aren't the friendliest bunch
in the land.

01:17:31.444 --> 01:17:33.411
That's putting it mildly.

01:17:33.413 --> 01:17:38.950
Mildly is the only way
I can put it these days.

01:17:38.952 --> 01:17:42.087
My normally scathing
and colorful insults

01:17:42.089 --> 01:17:48.694
were stolen from me by that
scoundrel, the goblin king.

01:17:48.696 --> 01:17:54.667
Um, King, what if we were to,
say, return your insults to you?

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:58.971
Then would you consider granting
us entry to the Goblin Kingdom?

01:17:58.973 --> 01:18:08.216
Why, I think
that would be wonderful, indeed.

01:18:14.621 --> 01:18:16.554
How's it hanging, King?

01:18:16.556 --> 01:18:19.191
I've got to get out of here,
Chomps.

01:18:19.193 --> 01:18:22.127
I have to get back
to my kingdom.

01:18:22.129 --> 01:18:25.164
You might not need me
after all, King.

01:18:25.166 --> 01:18:27.732
That rescue party you mentioned
is on its way.

01:18:27.734 --> 01:18:30.401
What are you talking about?

01:18:30.403 --> 01:18:33.304
Princess Cupcake
and some flying thing.

01:18:33.306 --> 01:18:35.039
A woodpecker or something.

01:18:35.041 --> 01:18:36.976
Fairy Pie.

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:41.312
She's my daughter's
fairy godmother and protector.

01:18:41.314 --> 01:18:43.015
Okay.
Yeah, that.

01:18:43.017 --> 01:18:44.749
They've just entered
the Goblin Kingdom

01:18:44.751 --> 01:18:46.418
and are headed this way.

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:50.356
What?
How do you know this, Chomps?

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:51.589
I'm a rat.

01:18:51.591 --> 01:18:54.026
Rats are super-sneaky.
Yeah.

01:18:54.028 --> 01:18:56.361
I see everything
that goes on around here.

01:18:56.363 --> 01:18:57.695
My goodness!

01:18:57.697 --> 01:19:00.566
They're in danger!

01:19:00.568 --> 01:19:03.634
They could be walking
into a trap.

01:19:03.636 --> 01:19:05.270
<i>Could</i> be?

01:19:05.272 --> 01:19:06.739
They're up Goblin Gulf

01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:08.606
without a paddle,
in my estimation.

01:19:08.608 --> 01:19:12.477
All we can do is prepare
to witness their demise.

01:19:35.603 --> 01:19:39.237
Hello, there, cute princess.

01:19:39.239 --> 01:19:42.274
You have finally arrived
to marry me.

01:19:44.144 --> 01:19:45.811
Why don't you let my father go?

01:19:45.813 --> 01:19:47.545
And I won't turn you into a...

01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:53.185
I love a troll princess
with some spunk.

01:19:53.187 --> 01:19:57.455
You'll make
an excellent goblin queen.

01:19:57.457 --> 01:19:59.658
Over my dead troll body.

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:03.294
Oh, what are
you supposed to be... a moth?

01:20:03.296 --> 01:20:06.231
Try a fairy godmother,
goblin-face.

01:20:06.233 --> 01:20:08.467
I know.

01:20:08.469 --> 01:20:10.636
Handsome, aren't I?

01:20:10.638 --> 01:20:12.771
Only if I had bad eyes.

01:20:12.773 --> 01:20:15.707
It's a good thing there
aren't any mirrors in here.

01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:18.677
Why don't you try
a different costume, King Frown?

01:20:18.679 --> 01:20:21.512
How about a cuddly bunny rabbit?

01:20:21.514 --> 01:20:23.615
- Huh?
- Prepare

01:20:23.617 --> 01:20:26.384
for some troll magic, goblin.

01:20:26.386 --> 01:20:29.154
For one who acts so big and bad,

01:20:29.156 --> 01:20:32.124
the thing you do
just makes us sad.

01:20:32.126 --> 01:20:34.826
Your poison venom
becomes sweet honey

01:20:34.828 --> 01:20:38.299
and your goblin hide
a cuddly bunny.

01:20:39.599 --> 01:20:41.400
Ha ha ha.

01:20:41.402 --> 01:20:43.435
Very cute.

01:20:47.373 --> 01:20:50.241
Oh, boy.
I'm scared, Belly.

01:20:52.679 --> 01:20:55.481
You puny little worms.

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:57.649
Now I shall...

01:20:57.651 --> 01:21:01.887
Um...

01:21:01.889 --> 01:21:04.323
what am I supposed to do, again?

01:21:04.325 --> 01:21:06.792
Oh, yeah!

01:21:06.794 --> 01:21:10.462
I'm gonna devour you.

01:21:10.464 --> 01:21:13.298
Just remember what
the Blackthorn Tree Fairy king

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.467
- told you.
- About not being able

01:21:15.469 --> 01:21:17.735
to use
the Blackthorn Forest spell?

01:21:17.737 --> 01:21:20.438
No.
About having power within.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.708
It's inside you, Leaf.

01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:24.212
Let it out.

01:21:24.778 --> 01:21:28.679
Now! No-o-o-w!

01:21:28.681 --> 01:21:33.584
Roaring through the skies,
meanest dragon you can't find,

01:21:33.586 --> 01:21:35.587
become a sweet dragon.

01:21:35.589 --> 01:21:38.723
Be gentle and kind.

01:21:42.862 --> 01:21:44.896
What happened?

01:21:44.898 --> 01:21:46.798
Hey, guys.

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.500
What's going on?

01:21:49.502 --> 01:21:50.936
Yeah!

01:21:50.938 --> 01:21:52.806
It worked!

01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:59.811
Cupcake,
what are we fighting for?

01:21:59.813 --> 01:22:02.914
Why don't you drop
all this silly animosity

01:22:02.916 --> 01:22:04.883
and come get hitched?

01:22:04.885 --> 01:22:09.454
Eww! Princess Cupcake
will never marry you, ugly.

01:22:09.456 --> 01:22:12.423
By the powers of the trolls,

01:22:12.425 --> 01:22:13.926
I'll let you know,

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:18.433
to turn this mean beast
into a soft flake of snow.

01:22:26.273 --> 01:22:27.806
You did it, Cupcake.

01:22:27.808 --> 01:22:30.712
You found your magic.

01:22:50.496 --> 01:22:54.799
Cupcake, how in the world
were you able to find me?

01:22:54.801 --> 01:22:57.302
And what of King Frown?

01:22:57.304 --> 01:23:01.005
King Frown's gone, Father,
never to return.

01:23:01.007 --> 01:23:03.307
I found my magic.

01:23:03.309 --> 01:23:06.744
Oh, Cupcake,
my dear, dear daughter.

01:23:06.746 --> 01:23:07.980
Are you all right?

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:10.249
They didn't hurt you, did they?

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:12.618
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:14.253
What about you?

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:16.722
This couldn't have been easy.

01:23:16.724 --> 01:23:19.825
You have no idea.

01:23:19.827 --> 01:23:24.463
Cupcake, I've been guilty
of a lack of foresight

01:23:24.465 --> 01:23:26.265
when it comes to you.

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:28.400
What do you mean, Father?

01:23:28.402 --> 01:23:32.271
You're a magical troll princess.

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:34.039
It's your birthright.

01:23:34.041 --> 01:23:38.509
And I've been coddling you
like a little Wee Troll.

01:23:38.511 --> 01:23:40.878
For that, I'm sorry.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:44.283
Please, forgive me.

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:46.852
There's nothing to forgive,
Father.

01:23:46.854 --> 01:23:50.789
I know you made the decisions
you made because you love me,

01:23:50.791 --> 01:23:54.692
and for that,
I can only thank you.

01:23:54.694 --> 01:23:57.529
Aww. Shucks.

01:23:57.531 --> 01:24:00.702
I didn't know
this would be such a tearjerker.

01:24:07.308 --> 01:24:10.609
When we find Grunt and he sees
Scorch has switched sides,

01:24:10.611 --> 01:24:13.011
I bet
he doesn't even put up a fight.

01:24:13.013 --> 01:24:15.579
I sure hope not.
I'm tuckered out.

01:24:15.581 --> 01:24:17.382
I sure could use a sandwich.

01:24:17.384 --> 01:24:20.584
And I could use a nap.

01:24:20.586 --> 01:24:25.490
I haven't worked this much
or breathed this much fire

01:24:25.492 --> 01:24:29.660
in, well... never.

01:24:29.662 --> 01:24:32.963
My wings and nostrils
are aching.

01:24:32.965 --> 01:24:34.900
Then let's get this over with

01:24:34.902 --> 01:24:38.306
and tuck you in
for some R and R, big buddy.

01:24:42.809 --> 01:24:47.012
I can't believe you accomplished
your mission in such short time,

01:24:47.014 --> 01:24:49.347
Princess Cupcake.

01:24:49.349 --> 01:24:53.618
No one's ever infiltrated
the Goblin Kingdom

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:56.620
and freed a prisoner before.

01:24:56.622 --> 01:25:02.994
King Basil, you must be
very proud of this young troll.

01:25:02.996 --> 01:25:06.964
I am, King of the Elves.

01:25:06.966 --> 01:25:09.868
Oh, about that.

01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:13.070
As you know,
I've ruled these woods

01:25:13.072 --> 01:25:16.441
for a very, very long time,

01:25:16.443 --> 01:25:22.146
and while I love my kingdom
and my elves,

01:25:22.148 --> 01:25:26.551
it gets lonely out here.

01:25:26.553 --> 01:25:29.588
What are you telling us, King?

01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:33.825
Asking is more like it.

01:25:33.827 --> 01:25:38.562
Cupcake, your devotion
and bravery to your kingdom

01:25:38.564 --> 01:25:41.866
is so inspiring, and I...

01:25:41.868 --> 01:25:44.636
I'd like to ask your permission

01:25:44.638 --> 01:25:48.807
to join
the Kingdom of the Trolls.

01:25:48.809 --> 01:25:52.543
But who will lead your land
if you leave?

01:25:52.545 --> 01:25:56.114
There are many elves here

01:25:56.116 --> 01:26:00.785
who are ready
and interested to lead.

01:26:00.787 --> 01:26:04.890
Well, if you're
truly interested, King,

01:26:04.892 --> 01:26:09.160
consider yourself
an honorary troll.

01:26:09.162 --> 01:26:11.195
All right!

01:26:11.197 --> 01:26:13.899
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:26:13.901 --> 01:26:16.668
Since you've been so helpful,

01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:21.472
I want to use my newfound magic
to give you something in return.

01:26:21.474 --> 01:26:26.076
Being nice for so long
clearly gave you a fit.

01:26:26.078 --> 01:26:28.079
Take this last gift.

01:26:28.081 --> 01:26:30.949
It's your old caustic wit.

01:26:30.951 --> 01:26:38.155
Why, that King Frown is
a no-good, dirty, low-down...

01:26:38.157 --> 01:26:41.895
Not in front of the princess!

01:26:50.237 --> 01:26:52.771
Say, where'd Scorch go?

01:26:52.773 --> 01:26:54.776
He's... Oh.

01:26:58.711 --> 01:27:02.580
Nice try, trolls.

01:27:02.582 --> 01:27:05.517
But my magic is strong.

01:27:05.519 --> 01:27:10.254
And your goofy spells
are weak sauce.

01:27:10.256 --> 01:27:16.160
I'll give you one chance
to bow down to your new leader,

01:27:16.162 --> 01:27:19.964
King Grunt the Great,

01:27:19.966 --> 01:27:26.538
before my minion Scorch here
turns you both to ash.

01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:29.673
Thanks for the offer, Grunt,
but we already have a leader.

01:27:29.675 --> 01:27:31.176
His name's King Basil,

01:27:31.178 --> 01:27:33.945
and he's coming home,
whether you like it or not.

01:27:33.947 --> 01:27:36.882
Have it your way, fools.

01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:40.518
Scorch, fry these nitwits.

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:44.588
Oh, all right.

01:27:44.590 --> 01:27:47.124
Flesh from bone, a dragon rends.

01:27:47.126 --> 01:27:50.561
Turn us back into old friends.

01:27:50.563 --> 01:27:53.130
What are you doing?

01:27:53.132 --> 01:27:56.901
Hey, stupid, I said
char these two to cinders.

01:27:56.903 --> 01:27:58.969
Do it... now!

01:27:58.971 --> 01:28:01.906
Bully trolls
can scream and shout.

01:28:01.908 --> 01:28:05.746
Now go away and just chill out.

01:28:12.685 --> 01:28:14.852
Oh, look at you.

01:28:14.854 --> 01:28:17.021
Scorch, you good?

01:28:17.023 --> 01:28:21.092
Yep.
Never been better.

01:28:21.094 --> 01:28:27.132
And now time to go back
to my lair and have a nap.

01:28:39.145 --> 01:28:40.945
Welcome home, King Basil.

01:28:40.947 --> 01:28:44.583
I just want to say that, without
your daughter's special bravery,

01:28:44.585 --> 01:28:47.084
we couldn't have saved
our Kingdom of the Trolls.

01:28:47.086 --> 01:28:48.587
I second that.

01:28:48.589 --> 01:28:50.021
Hey, I smell food.

01:28:50.023 --> 01:28:51.789
Is there a banquet table around?

01:28:51.791 --> 01:28:54.025
Leaf, Bellyrumble,

01:28:54.027 --> 01:28:58.797
I want to thank you
for your special bravery,

01:28:58.799 --> 01:29:03.067
and, as a reward, invite you
to take any riches

01:29:03.069 --> 01:29:07.607
from my castle
that your hearts desire.

01:29:09.276 --> 01:29:12.677
Oh!
Where's the kitchen?

01:29:12.679 --> 01:29:15.012
Um, with all due respect, King,

01:29:15.014 --> 01:29:18.950
the only thing in your castle
that my heart desires...

01:29:18.952 --> 01:29:21.852
is Princess Cupcake's hand.

01:29:21.854 --> 01:29:24.789
Cupcake, will you marry me?

01:29:24.791 --> 01:29:27.659
I-I...

01:29:27.661 --> 01:29:29.628
I will. Yes.

01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:31.262
I'll marry you, Leaf.

01:29:31.264 --> 01:29:34.899
What a lucky troll I am!

01:29:34.901 --> 01:29:39.204
I got my kingdom <i>and</i> a son.

01:29:39.206 --> 01:29:42.740
Yeah!

01:29:45.245 --> 01:29:48.282

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:31.391
My name's Grubhead.

01:30:32.125 --> 01:30:36.727
And I have an offer
that might interest you.

01:30:36.729 --> 01:30:39.297
You've got nothing I want,
jelly roll.

01:30:39.299 --> 01:30:42.267
Now scram before I turn you
into pond scum.

01:30:42.269 --> 01:30:47.405
I'm a master of the Mighty Spell
of the Dreary Put-downs.

01:30:47.407 --> 01:30:50.341
Have it your way.

01:30:50.343 --> 01:30:54.178
Stay warm, troll.

01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:58.986

Where'd you go?

Let's... Let's hear that offer.

01:31:16.068 --> 01:31:17.237
Hello?

01:31:24.077 --> 01:31:27.277
Leaf, that was so romantic.

01:31:27.279 --> 01:31:30.048
How long have you felt this way?

01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:33.151
Since I first set eyes
on you, Cupcake.

01:31:33.153 --> 01:31:35.954
Oh, my.

01:31:35.956 --> 01:31:38.188
I don't know what to say.

01:31:38.190 --> 01:31:41.359
You don't have to say anything.
Just know this.

01:31:41.361 --> 01:31:44.094
Any time you want to strike out
and see the world

01:31:44.096 --> 01:31:48.098
or meet new creatures or go
on an adventure, I'm with you.

01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:50.802
As long as you'll take me,
of course.

01:31:50.804 --> 01:31:52.203
Oh, Leaf.

01:31:52.205 --> 01:31:55.142
Of course I will.

Leaf!

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:04.082
