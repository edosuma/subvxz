00:17.003 --> 00:17.934
Doug?

00:18.171 --> 00:19.729
Come on! We're busy again.

00:19.939 --> 00:21.134
I'm on double shift.

00:21.341 --> 00:24.138
So am I, and you wanted
a long weekend. Now get up.

00:24.343 --> 00:26.334
I was having a terrific dream.

00:26.545 --> 00:29.105
I was beating my high-school
football coach.

00:29.315 --> 00:32.250
Carter! Med students
don't sleep at 4:00 p.m.

00:32.451 --> 00:33.975
Get up, Carter.

00:37.055 --> 00:39.456
Woman with a headache,
thinks it's a brain tumor.

00:39.658 --> 00:43.594
A kid with gum in his eye,
and an old lady who wants her hand held.

00:43.795 --> 00:45.591
- I'm hungry.
- Cookies at the desk.

00:45.797 --> 00:48.561
Repeat H and H ordered
for abdominal pain in 2.

00:48.766 --> 00:51.131
- Good morning, Susan.
- It's afternoon.

00:51.335 --> 00:52.394
I knew that.

00:52.604 --> 00:55.333
Your brain's rotted.
At your age, Ryne Sandberg retired.

00:55.539 --> 00:57.063
At my age, Mozart was dead.

00:57.274 --> 01:00.641
Jen, I can't get out. I've got
two residents on double shifts.

01:00.844 --> 01:02.812
I'll be home before Rachel goes to bed.

01:03.013 --> 01:05.311
- Tell Mark to go see his wife.
- Go see her.

01:05.515 --> 01:07.573
Why can't you tell me over the phone?

01:07.783 --> 01:11.184
Hang on. Jen, it's Doug.
Can you hold on a second?

01:11.387 --> 01:12.684
We can survive without you.

01:14.323 --> 01:16.916
I'll meet you there, all right? Bye.

01:17.425 --> 01:20.293
Thank you. I know you
can survive without me.

01:20.495 --> 01:24.056
Rescue's bringing in two victims,
motor-vehicle collision, one major.

01:24.266 --> 01:25.324
- How soon?
- Now.

01:25.533 --> 01:27.501
- Where's Benton?
- Am I his travel agent?

01:27.701 --> 01:29.260
Ask his student.

01:31.072 --> 01:33.063
Read about diseases,
you think you have them.

01:33.274 --> 01:35.970
Find Benton, head-on vehicle.
Two victims on the way.

01:36.377 --> 01:39.141
TC, seven months OB, vitals stable.

01:39.346 --> 01:40.676
Second victim behind her.

01:40.881 --> 01:42.143
What's your name, ma'am?

01:42.348 --> 01:44.373
- Sally Niemeyer.
- How far along are you?

01:44.584 --> 01:46.051
Almost seven months.

01:46.252 --> 01:47.947
Second one coming in.

01:50.323 --> 01:52.223
Chest trauma, vitals stable.

01:52.692 --> 01:53.954
Air bag didn't open.

01:54.160 --> 01:58.062
Name's Suarez, gangbanger,
stole a car, hit the pregnant lady.

01:59.898 --> 02:01.889
Miss Suarez, is there any pain?

02:07.606 --> 02:10.402
CBC, type and cross,
and hold four units.

02:10.609 --> 02:12.941
Hook her up to a fetal monitor.
Now, please.

02:13.145 --> 02:15.977
- Your baby has a steady heartbeat.
- I'm gonna have a boy.

02:16.180 --> 02:19.308
Get a K & B, call OB for ultrasound.
Does this hurt?

02:19.517 --> 02:21.074
Do you have pain in your head?

02:21.285 --> 02:25.483
No. That girl, she just ran
right into me, didn't even stop.

02:25.690 --> 02:27.247
What about me, man?

02:27.457 --> 02:28.856
Push down with your hand.

02:29.059 --> 02:30.321
Push again.

02:30.527 --> 02:31.960
That's good. Good.

02:32.162 --> 02:34.460
Push down on your foot,
like on a gas pedal.

02:37.334 --> 02:38.824
You're doing great.

02:39.702 --> 02:41.192
All right, gently.

02:44.940 --> 02:45.770
What?

02:47.943 --> 02:50.935
<i>You're in labor. Two centimeters
dilated, 40% effaced.</i>

02:51.146 --> 02:52.703
Can somebody call my husband?

02:53.182 --> 02:54.512
28 weeks, that's too early.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.379
- Want to stop it?
- I want to buy time for the kid's lungs.

02:57.752 --> 02:59.310
What if it's 34 weeks?

02:59.520 --> 03:01.147
It doesn't feel like 34 weeks.

03:01.689 --> 03:03.246
We need ultrasound.

03:03.457 --> 03:04.322
I don't know.

03:04.925 --> 03:05.984
It's too early.

03:06.461 --> 03:07.449
We gotta try.

03:07.661 --> 03:08.923
Will my baby be okay?

03:09.129 --> 03:10.562
Let's stop the labor.

03:10.764 --> 03:13.631
Bolus her six grams magnesium sulfate.

03:15.335 --> 03:17.599
Get a fetal lung profile.
Where's OB?

03:17.803 --> 03:18.828
What about me?

03:19.039 --> 03:20.562
Is my baby okay?

03:22.174 --> 03:23.368
It's okay.

03:23.743 --> 03:24.938
It's okay.

04:19.661 --> 04:21.822
That's incredible! It's terrific.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.894
I still can't believe it.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.259
Why didn't you tell me on the phone?

04:28.102 --> 04:29.831
It's in Milwaukee.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.799
It's only two hours away.

04:33.207 --> 04:34.640
And a federal clerkship.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.866
I never dreamed I had a chance.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.841
I thought you wanted to be
a state's attorney.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.344
They haven't made an offer.

04:41.549 --> 04:45.848
The judge had a clerk.
The guy bagged out at the last minute.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.211
It's a great break for you.

04:48.521 --> 04:49.988
You deserve it.

04:51.824 --> 04:53.257
You deserve it.

04:54.427 --> 04:56.759
There's lots of hospitals there.

04:56.962 --> 04:59.897
I don't know
about chief residents, but...

05:02.433 --> 05:05.301
We could live here, and
you could take the train.

05:06.637 --> 05:08.832
Four hours a day on a train?

05:09.441 --> 05:11.238
When will I have time to sleep?

05:11.443 --> 05:13.069
I'll never get to see Rachel.

05:20.117 --> 05:22.085
I'll make some phone calls.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.080
See what they got up there.

05:32.228 --> 05:34.561
I've made a lot of compromises, Mark.

05:48.843 --> 05:50.174
Doug, they're not stopping.

05:50.378 --> 05:51.812
Contractions two minutes apart.

05:52.647 --> 05:53.637
Doug?

05:53.882 --> 05:56.578
I don't like this.
We're gonna have major lung trouble.

05:56.885 --> 05:59.614
- Fetal heart rate?
- 135 and dropping.

05:59.820 --> 06:02.221
We got 128. Late decelerations.

06:02.590 --> 06:05.080
- Fetal distress may be acidotic.
- What's wrong?

06:05.292 --> 06:06.487
Is my baby okay?

06:09.496 --> 06:11.157
We're taking care of your baby.

06:15.569 --> 06:16.592
Her water's broken.

06:16.937 --> 06:20.167
All right, we can't stop this.
Let's go for delivery.

06:22.108 --> 06:25.042
Call OB. Tell them we're on the way.

06:25.243 --> 06:28.338
Call Neonatal, tell them
to expect a preemie, 28 weeks.

06:28.548 --> 06:30.277
Tell Third Floor to send a team to 5.

06:30.482 --> 06:33.315
Mrs. Niemeyer, you're gonna
deliver your baby right now.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.645
- Let's clear that, please!
- You got it?

06:35.854 --> 06:36.843
Here you go.

06:41.326 --> 06:42.452
How's Jennifer?

06:42.661 --> 06:45.254
She got a great job in Milwaukee.

06:45.729 --> 06:47.219
Can she do it by phone?

06:47.431 --> 06:50.457
I don't think that's what
the federal judge has in mind.

06:50.667 --> 06:52.135
Milwaukee?

06:52.702 --> 06:54.602
Don't ask. I don't know.

06:56.539 --> 06:59.064
Miss Suarez, you hit a pregnant woman.

06:59.275 --> 07:02.438
We're not too happy about that,
but we'll take care of you.

07:02.645 --> 07:04.670
Now, you have to tell us the truth.

07:04.881 --> 07:07.076
- Did you take any drugs today?
- No.

07:07.282 --> 07:10.184
170 over 100. Pulse 120.

07:10.787 --> 07:13.118
Do any cocaine, maybe a little crack?

07:13.822 --> 07:14.948
No!

07:15.324 --> 07:16.916
Yeah, right.

07:17.559 --> 07:21.222
CBC, tox screen and
let's get a chest film. Now.

07:22.931 --> 07:24.056
Look at this board!

07:24.298 --> 07:26.198
Don't worry, it'll get quieter.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.369
Don't say the "Q" word.
You'll start a stampede.

07:29.604 --> 07:31.902
- Take the kid in 1.
- All right.

07:32.373 --> 07:34.806
- She deliver?
- Right out of the elevator.

07:35.008 --> 07:37.910
The baby's in Neonatal,
lungs are bad, hyaline membrane.

07:38.112 --> 07:39.476
Good night. Mom's okay.

07:39.680 --> 07:40.668
Good night, Billy.

07:42.248 --> 07:43.579
Dr. Ross?

07:44.150 --> 07:44.980
Can I talk to you?

07:45.185 --> 07:46.948
Sure, if you can keep me awake.

07:47.953 --> 07:52.653
If a patient has a burning
sensation, does he necessarily have...?

07:52.859 --> 07:54.690
A sexually transmitted disease?
Probably.

07:54.893 --> 07:57.384
You have to do a culture.
Ever do that?

07:57.596 --> 07:59.120
No. Okay.

07:59.465 --> 08:01.490
First you gotta do a chlamydia prep.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.097
Then you have to do a Gram's stain...

08:04.302 --> 08:05.327
...for gonorrhea.

08:05.537 --> 08:06.696
Stick this bad boy...

08:06.904 --> 08:10.670
...in about a quarter of an inch,
and spin it around about ten times.

08:10.875 --> 08:12.274
Ten times?

08:12.477 --> 08:13.967
Who's the lucky girl?

08:16.381 --> 08:18.848
Liz. The girl with the rash.

08:20.584 --> 08:24.611
Old hospital saying, Carter:
Don't dip your pen in company ink.

08:24.821 --> 08:26.755
I hope you used a condom.

08:29.759 --> 08:34.355
We got a Code 3 from Rescue 63, full
arrest. They're on their way in now.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.491
Can I take her?

08:36.698 --> 08:38.291
Not until her tests are back.

08:38.501 --> 08:40.092
She's breathing, ain't she?

08:41.604 --> 08:45.334
She stole the car
and hit a pregnant lady.

08:46.741 --> 08:49.107
For all I know, she could
have an aortic rupture.

08:49.310 --> 08:50.937
You want her to die in jail?

08:51.379 --> 08:52.710
Frankly, doc?

08:53.181 --> 08:54.773
I wouldn't lose sleep.

08:57.851 --> 08:58.876
Neither would I.

08:59.086 --> 09:01.213
But I'm liable. You're not.

09:05.159 --> 09:07.559
Mom, listen. I can barely hear you.

09:09.430 --> 09:10.896
Got a heart. Where to?

09:11.098 --> 09:13.532
Trauma 2. Last door on your right.

09:14.734 --> 09:17.066
- Susan, we need you.
- I gotta go. Bye.

09:22.141 --> 09:24.439
I'm really okay. Are you doctors?

09:24.644 --> 09:25.473
I'm Dr. Lewis.

09:25.677 --> 09:27.508
I thought he was in full arrest.

09:27.713 --> 09:30.614
I was, until they
fried my chest hairs.

09:31.516 --> 09:33.983
Let's get a CBC, Chem-7, blood gas...

09:34.185 --> 09:35.551
...and coag panel.

09:35.754 --> 09:38.119
On my count. One, two...

09:38.322 --> 09:39.312
...three.

09:40.391 --> 09:42.917
He was in fib. Shocked him once,
converted fast.

09:43.127 --> 09:45.118
He had a 100 milligrams of lidocaine.

09:50.434 --> 09:51.799
How did it feel? Any pain?

09:52.335 --> 09:53.894
I don't remember.

09:54.637 --> 09:55.627
I passed out.

09:55.840 --> 09:56.999
Can we get a monitor?

09:57.207 --> 10:01.439
Do you have a history
of heart problems, Mr. Gasner?

10:01.643 --> 10:03.304
Nothing a transplant wouldn't cure.

10:03.946 --> 10:05.413
I was up for a good one.

10:05.614 --> 10:07.912
A kid in a motorcycle accident.

10:08.117 --> 10:09.482
It went to Minneapolis.

10:10.219 --> 10:11.550
Who's your cardiologist?

10:11.754 --> 10:14.245
Mike Dickey. Great guy.

10:14.455 --> 10:16.423
He's at St. Luke's in Cleveland.

10:16.624 --> 10:18.592
I'm in town
for the builders' convention.

10:19.428 --> 10:21.328
My wife said I shouldn't travel.

10:21.662 --> 10:25.154
But how could I miss 2,000
construction guys in one...

10:26.834 --> 10:28.062
I don't get a pulse.

10:28.269 --> 10:29.098
Mr. Gasner?

10:31.839 --> 10:33.135
What? He's not in fib.

10:33.340 --> 10:34.330
Give him an amp of epi.

10:38.411 --> 10:39.435
Come on.

10:39.646 --> 10:40.772
Come on back.

10:40.981 --> 10:42.471
I'll call for his history.

10:50.322 --> 10:51.311
I just pass out.

10:54.126 --> 10:58.562
Start a dopamine drip, 400
in 250 D5W, 10 drops a minute.

10:59.030 --> 11:01.191
My chest feels like someone sat on it.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.123
That happens sometimes.

11:06.204 --> 11:07.501
I know.

11:10.141 --> 11:12.109
Give her something. She can't breathe.

11:12.310 --> 11:14.369
That's it.
Keep taking deep breaths.

11:15.245 --> 11:16.372
Blood gases are back.

11:17.881 --> 11:19.872
Not good. PO-2's 70.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.074
Are you taking any medications?

11:22.285 --> 11:25.687
It's never been this bad.

11:26.756 --> 11:29.123
Hand-held nebs,
albuterol 2.5 milligrams.

11:29.326 --> 11:31.055
Peak flow, pre and post.

11:31.261 --> 11:33.023
Give her Solumedrol
50 mgs IV.

11:33.229 --> 11:35.561
Can I talk to you outside for a second?

11:35.765 --> 11:38.461
Sandy, this is Lydia.
She'll take care of you.

11:38.668 --> 11:40.635
You're gonna be fine, okay?

11:43.004 --> 11:44.232
Just keep breathing.

11:44.439 --> 11:45.633
Keep breathing.

11:47.509 --> 11:50.102
Your daughter's having
a serious asthma attack.

11:50.312 --> 11:51.642
Is she allergic to anything?

11:51.846 --> 11:53.404
I don't think so.

11:53.614 --> 11:55.105
Do you have any pets?

11:55.816 --> 11:57.408
This cat, a stray.

11:57.618 --> 11:59.483
Sandy found her.
She just loves her.

11:59.687 --> 12:01.314
You have to get rid of the cat.

12:01.522 --> 12:05.117
We need to do some tests.
It'll take about two hours, okay?

12:14.500 --> 12:17.491
Gasner, G-A-S-N-E-R, first name Samuel.

12:17.703 --> 12:19.170
Can you fax us his chart?

12:19.371 --> 12:22.034
Are you a doctor?
They said my wife was here.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.071
What's your name?

12:23.275 --> 12:26.506
Niemeyer. She's pregnant.
Is she all right?

12:26.712 --> 12:28.839
Jerry. Mr. Niemeyer.

12:29.047 --> 12:30.878
I'll take you up to Neonatal.

12:31.083 --> 12:31.913
Neo-what?

12:32.116 --> 12:33.106
You had a baby.

12:33.318 --> 12:34.477
Thanks, Jerry.

12:34.685 --> 12:38.052
Dr. Greene, with an "E"
at the end. He's chief resident.

12:40.391 --> 12:42.086
I got a little tired.

12:42.793 --> 12:45.090
Built 15 houses this year.

12:45.696 --> 12:50.428
I wanted to design them,
but I just build them.

12:51.167 --> 12:53.135
Could you stop talking for a second?

12:56.339 --> 13:00.366
Old inferior wall MI, low voltage...

13:01.011 --> 13:03.342
...consistent with severe myopathy.

13:04.848 --> 13:07.782
I've been through this.
I know what it says.

13:08.350 --> 13:09.612
It's nothing new.

13:10.452 --> 13:11.851
Am I gonna make it tonight?

13:13.589 --> 13:15.523
I ask every time.

13:18.393 --> 13:19.326
He's in fib.

13:19.961 --> 13:21.258
Charging.

13:23.097 --> 13:24.086
Ready.

13:24.732 --> 13:25.824
- Two hundred.
- Clear.

13:28.703 --> 13:30.068
Another 50 of lidocaine.

13:30.271 --> 13:31.703
Start a drip.

13:32.206 --> 13:33.570
Two grams at 500.

13:36.310 --> 13:37.834
I don't usually do that.

13:42.783 --> 13:44.978
Could somebody please call my wife?

13:59.097 --> 14:00.530
That's a big boggy heart.

14:00.732 --> 14:03.132
Suppose we get a transplant.
Is it too late?

14:03.335 --> 14:04.859
He's been defibrillated twice.

14:05.070 --> 14:06.731
He in cardiogenic shock.

14:06.938 --> 14:09.599
Keeps going in and out.
Can't be much muscle there.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.832
Jerry, call Cardiology for an echo.

14:12.042 --> 14:14.738
Wake up Dr. Flint,
get him here from Lake Forest.

14:14.945 --> 14:18.641
Call the transplant coordinator,
see if they got any hearts around.

14:18.849 --> 14:20.315
And your wife called.

14:20.516 --> 14:22.507
Great! I missed calling Rachel.

14:22.719 --> 14:24.516
Get ahold of the Gasner family?

14:24.721 --> 14:26.416
I'm trying every ten minutes.

14:26.622 --> 14:29.853
Gasner doesn't think
he'll make it through the night.

14:32.662 --> 14:35.630
Dr. Ross, peak flow's
gone from 190 to 300.

14:35.832 --> 14:37.492
- How's her gases?
- Much better.

14:37.699 --> 14:40.032
Sandy, you are doing great.

14:40.236 --> 14:42.362
She'll need an appointment
with your doctor.

14:42.571 --> 14:45.802
She's also going to need
an inhaler at home...

14:46.007 --> 14:48.943
...and prednisone.
Fill this thing out tonight.

14:49.144 --> 14:52.203
Hospital pharmacy is open 24 hours...

14:52.413 --> 14:54.438
...and it's on the first floor.

14:55.249 --> 14:56.477
There you go.

15:03.289 --> 15:04.779
I thought you were off at 10.

15:04.991 --> 15:08.154
- I'm on all night. How about you?
- I'm on a double.

15:09.529 --> 15:10.655
- Thank you.
- Sure.

15:10.864 --> 15:14.459
Why is Mark getting messages
from University Hospital in Milwaukee?

15:14.667 --> 15:16.635
His wife wants to move.
She got a job there.

15:16.836 --> 15:18.201
Is he gonna do it?

15:18.405 --> 15:20.065
I hope not.

15:20.740 --> 15:23.037
I can't imagine he'd be happy there.

15:25.644 --> 15:26.702
He ever go home?

15:26.912 --> 15:29.142
He's waiting for that
gang girl's recovery.

15:33.519 --> 15:34.485
What's he doing?

15:34.685 --> 15:36.482
Practicing one-handed knots.

15:36.687 --> 15:38.655
He'd do it with his teeth if he could.

15:38.856 --> 15:41.153
No, you can't wear
a glove on your teeth.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.521
What are you listening to?

15:45.830 --> 15:47.694
Snoop Doggy Dog.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.835
<i>Trends in Cardiac Surgery, Volume Two.</i>

16:01.477 --> 16:04.412
Blood pressure's falling, 80 over 60.

16:04.613 --> 16:09.072
Add a dobutamine drip, 250 in 250,
4cc's a minute.

16:10.119 --> 16:11.677
You feel crummy...

16:12.787 --> 16:16.621
...waiting around for a kid to smash up
his car so you can get his heart.

16:16.891 --> 16:18.620
We're getting great pictures.

16:18.860 --> 16:20.919
Frame one for me, will you?

16:26.568 --> 16:27.591
How's your heart?

16:27.801 --> 16:30.269
It's in pretty good shape.

16:30.804 --> 16:32.999
Want to lend it to me for the weekend?

16:36.542 --> 16:38.669
You got better things to do with it.

16:40.113 --> 16:44.277
Do them all. You never know
when you'll get the chance.

16:44.584 --> 16:46.552
Left ventricle, please.

16:49.689 --> 16:50.882
You got kids, doc?

16:51.256 --> 16:53.451
A daughter. She's five.

16:55.060 --> 16:56.960
My girl's nine.

16:59.431 --> 17:00.989
Her age...

17:02.801 --> 17:04.769
...I shouldn't really travel.

17:08.573 --> 17:10.768
I miss too much of her life.

17:13.644 --> 17:15.339
What can I say?

17:17.748 --> 17:19.271
I love the job.

17:19.884 --> 17:21.009
How you doing?

17:21.452 --> 17:26.354
To tell you the truth, I felt
a hell of a lot better yesterday.

17:28.191 --> 17:29.886
What's your wife do, doc?

17:30.426 --> 17:31.722
She's a lawyer.

17:31.928 --> 17:33.861
You guys must have your hands full.

17:37.533 --> 17:38.830
Did I get any tests back?

17:39.034 --> 17:40.729
- On who?
- A patient.

17:41.170 --> 17:42.797
Does the patient have a name?

17:43.005 --> 17:45.200
Yeah. It's Car-tere.

17:45.806 --> 17:47.138
I'll watch out for them.

17:47.342 --> 17:49.037
Don't tell anybody the results.

17:49.244 --> 17:51.212
"Secret" is my middle name.

17:51.412 --> 17:53.380
Gasner, Samuel. We called in.

17:53.581 --> 17:55.640
Look, we'll take any heart.

17:55.850 --> 17:56.941
Anything?

17:58.452 --> 18:01.717
Type A blood, negative
T-cell cross-match, okay?

18:01.923 --> 18:04.117
Keep us posted. We need a heart.

18:04.324 --> 18:05.416
Thank you.

18:05.625 --> 18:06.717
He's getting weaker.

18:06.927 --> 18:09.293
I can't pull a heart out of thin air.

18:09.496 --> 18:11.191
Gunshot wound to the foot.

18:11.398 --> 18:13.592
The liquor store guy again,
asking for you.

18:13.799 --> 18:17.428
Ivan? What does he do,
wear a sign that says "shoot me"?

18:24.143 --> 18:26.542
Lvan, lvan, lvan.
Who did it this time?

18:26.744 --> 18:27.871
Me, I did it.

18:28.079 --> 18:31.014
- I thought you didn't have a gun.
- I bought a little Glock.

18:31.216 --> 18:32.240
Oh, God, it hurts!

18:32.450 --> 18:36.682
Let's get a gram of ancef, and
150 gentamycin IV, book an O.R.

18:36.888 --> 18:39.378
That last BP was a little high,
180 over 110.

18:39.590 --> 18:41.888
All right, 10 Procardia sublingual.

18:42.093 --> 18:45.027
Russia's crazy.
You need vodka to get good doctor.

18:45.562 --> 18:46.824
God bless America.

18:47.030 --> 18:49.157
God didn't bless your neighborhood.

18:49.366 --> 18:52.665
I was showing the gun to Nicky,
the dry cleaner, and bang!

18:52.869 --> 18:54.028
Off went half your toe.

18:54.437 --> 18:55.427
Will I lose it?

18:55.771 --> 18:56.601
You already did.

18:58.341 --> 18:59.467
Let's go.

19:01.177 --> 19:02.667
Still can't find a donor.

19:02.877 --> 19:04.970
There's one,
but the blood type is AB.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.670
How hard is it to find a type A?

19:06.881 --> 19:10.647
The patient has advanced
dilated cardiomyopathy...

19:10.852 --> 19:12.843
...with severe mitral regurgitation...

19:13.054 --> 19:15.579
<i>... and an ejection fraction
of less than 10%.</i>

19:15.889 --> 19:18.256
This is not the best news
I've heard all day.

19:18.460 --> 19:21.257
So, Steve, do you have an opinion?

19:21.462 --> 19:26.024
Dr. Kayson and I agree on little, but
we're both happy not to be Mr. Gasner.

19:26.233 --> 19:30.863
What if we put him on a heart-lung
bypass while we look for another donor?

19:31.071 --> 19:34.335
I'd say the stress alone
would kill him in a couple of hours.

19:34.540 --> 19:38.601
Put the transplant team on call. We'll
put him on the table in 20 minutes.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.275
Mr. Gasner's wife
will be here around three.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.680
Somebody's going to have to tell them.

19:57.462 --> 19:59.725
Have the desk beep me
when she gets here.

20:15.813 --> 20:16.779
Hey, Carter!

20:16.980 --> 20:18.345
Bend over!

20:19.049 --> 20:20.516
There we go.

20:22.285 --> 20:24.549
I'm cooking now.

20:24.988 --> 20:26.785
All right, hold still.

20:27.389 --> 20:28.914
What is he doing?

20:30.092 --> 20:31.218
I lost a bet.

20:31.460 --> 20:32.791
He's my backboard.

20:34.129 --> 20:34.959
Mark?

20:35.197 --> 20:36.664
I'm on a roll here. Here we go.

20:36.865 --> 20:38.627
And the shot!

20:38.834 --> 20:40.664
You ruined my concentration.

20:43.572 --> 20:45.335
Dr. Ross?

20:45.807 --> 20:47.468
Baby in 4.

20:51.846 --> 20:53.107
Seven inches taller...

20:54.115 --> 20:55.638
...I would've been a contender.

20:55.850 --> 20:58.114
Bulls. Knicks.

20:58.985 --> 21:01.613
- Any luck with that heart?
- No.

21:13.499 --> 21:15.694
I heard your wife
got a job in Milwaukee.

21:16.469 --> 21:19.302
Yeah, she's clerking
for a federal judge.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.231
That sounds exciting.

21:23.909 --> 21:25.034
It is.

21:26.444 --> 21:27.877
You gonna leave the hospital?

21:32.650 --> 21:33.877
I don't know.

21:34.786 --> 21:36.048
I thought you were off.

21:39.423 --> 21:40.413
Yeah, I am.

21:40.624 --> 21:43.650
I just thought I'd stick around.

21:45.129 --> 21:48.564
You ever have one like Mr. Gasner
before, one that took so long?

21:48.932 --> 21:49.920
No.

21:57.006 --> 21:58.530
You look like hell, Carter.

22:00.909 --> 22:04.538
Yeah, I'm just waiting for Ben...
Dr. Benton to leave.

22:05.915 --> 22:07.404
You need some sleep.

22:14.890 --> 22:16.653
That hurt.

22:17.391 --> 22:20.451
You've taken a bad fall, Mrs. Fadem.

22:21.162 --> 22:22.322
I'll get some x-rays.

22:22.596 --> 22:26.327
No. No x-rays.
They'll hurt my baby.

22:28.068 --> 22:29.501
How long have you been pregnant?

22:29.804 --> 22:31.396
Six months now.

22:34.107 --> 22:38.476
Your baby'll be protected.
We'll shield you with lead...

22:38.678 --> 22:40.339
...and we'll use a low dose.

22:42.849 --> 22:45.510
As long as you promise
not to hurt my baby.

22:46.519 --> 22:47.348
I promise.

22:52.290 --> 22:53.280
Lydia...

22:53.859 --> 22:57.794
...take Mrs. Fadem to Radiology.
And be careful of her pregnancy.

22:57.995 --> 22:59.327
Right away.

23:00.765 --> 23:02.699
- Her what?
- Pregnancy.

23:06.771 --> 23:08.398
You worry too much.

23:08.606 --> 23:10.130
Kayson hates me.

23:10.341 --> 23:11.432
He's a cardiologist.

23:11.642 --> 23:14.042
He's on my review board.
I'll need his recommendation.

23:14.244 --> 23:15.404
Why would you want it?

23:15.980 --> 23:19.744
The man loses so many patients,
he gets endorsements from funeral homes.

23:21.017 --> 23:25.214
When I was your age I worried about
what every attending thought of me too.

23:25.421 --> 23:27.616
Forget it. You're a good doctor.

23:28.057 --> 23:30.787
You're better than my ex,
and I actually married her.

23:30.993 --> 23:35.794
A lot of subjects interest me, and
believe me, your ex-wife tops my list.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.798
That's me.

23:40.301 --> 23:43.702
My knife-wielding psychotic
must be up from his nap.

23:46.140 --> 23:47.129
Later.

23:53.647 --> 23:54.875
Your wife's on her way.

23:55.749 --> 23:57.546
She'll be a wreck.

23:58.018 --> 24:00.178
He's not putting out fluids.

24:01.221 --> 24:03.246
One-sixty of Lasix.

24:04.257 --> 24:05.555
Hey, doc?

24:06.760 --> 24:07.953
Do I look stupid?

24:09.196 --> 24:10.628
Why don't you tell me?

24:11.631 --> 24:13.462
You versus God.

24:14.634 --> 24:15.623
We know who wins.

24:16.735 --> 24:18.135
I don't think of it that way.

24:20.472 --> 24:22.065
You don't have to.

24:24.109 --> 24:25.474
I'm the one on the table.

24:31.916 --> 24:33.713
We looked at your echo.

24:34.251 --> 24:37.049
And if we don't find a donor heart...

24:37.688 --> 24:40.588
...you probably won't
make it through the night.

24:47.931 --> 24:49.660
It's two in the morning.

24:51.668 --> 24:53.067
I'm dying.

24:54.604 --> 24:56.231
So please...

24:57.874 --> 24:59.568
...call me Sam.

25:03.679 --> 25:05.772
This is no time to be formal.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.094
Don't forget to check on lvan.

25:21.295 --> 25:22.761
Can I take the girl now?

25:22.963 --> 25:24.022
The gangbanger?

25:24.231 --> 25:27.689
Aortic rupture. I forgot to tell you,
she died in recovery.

25:27.902 --> 25:28.890
Well...

25:29.436 --> 25:30.926
I'll see you at seven.

25:31.137 --> 25:32.229
- A. M?
- Good night.

25:32.439 --> 25:34.407
Why bother driving home?
Three hours sleep.

25:34.608 --> 25:37.099
I've got to come back here.
This is nuts.

25:37.309 --> 25:42.246
Quinn, Daniel. Hypotensive, comatose.
Fraternity kid, drinking all night.

25:42.515 --> 25:44.574
Ever see anybody intubated?

25:45.250 --> 25:46.239
No.

25:47.152 --> 25:49.586
Get Respiratory in here.
Start a second line.

25:49.788 --> 25:51.585
D50, one amp, 2 mg Narcan.

25:51.790 --> 25:53.950
Pam, get an EKG.

25:54.225 --> 25:56.557
Mr. Quinn, do you hear me?

25:57.528 --> 25:59.359
- Daniel?
- Respiratory's on the way.

25:59.864 --> 26:02.594
He's cyanotic. Add dopamine.
Hyperventilate him.

26:02.800 --> 26:03.892
The line's in, Susan.

26:04.102 --> 26:05.967
BP 70 over 40 and falling.

26:06.170 --> 26:09.161
Get a CBC, blood alcohol,
Chem-7 and tox screen. Tube him.

26:09.373 --> 26:10.362
Blood sat's 80.

26:10.574 --> 26:12.167
Do a dextrose stick.

26:12.376 --> 26:15.902
Okay, Carter, pay attention.
This is where it counts.

26:16.112 --> 26:17.375
Visualize the cords.

26:17.581 --> 26:21.607
You don't want to miss the trachea
and end up in his esophagus.

26:28.157 --> 26:29.590
It's in.

26:30.292 --> 26:31.623
Bag him.

26:32.261 --> 26:35.424
Listen to the lungs to make sure
the tube's in place.

26:35.631 --> 26:39.692
Glucose is normal.
BP is steady, 80 over 65.

26:41.136 --> 26:42.262
Draw a blood gas now.

26:49.743 --> 26:50.732
Doug?

26:50.944 --> 26:54.277
They called from Neonatal
if you want to look at the preemie.

26:54.481 --> 26:55.778
He's gonna be okay.

26:55.983 --> 26:57.610
God smiled on him.

26:57.818 --> 26:59.183
Since when do you believe in God?

26:59.386 --> 27:02.354
I've been contemplating
my insignificance in the universe.

27:02.555 --> 27:04.386
I thought you were its center.

27:04.590 --> 27:05.818
Not always.

27:06.025 --> 27:09.289
I'm looking for Dr. Ross.
He's in the emergency room.

27:09.495 --> 27:11.428
Yeah, I'm Dr. Ross.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.629
Thank you very much.

27:14.167 --> 27:15.394
You're welcome.

27:16.868 --> 27:17.858
Who are you?

27:18.071 --> 27:20.197
I'm Randy Niemeyer.

27:20.706 --> 27:22.105
My wife, my baby...

27:23.008 --> 27:24.737
They said you took her up.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.107
My boy's gonna be okay.

27:28.345 --> 27:31.508
I'm just on my way up to see your baby.
You want to?

27:39.623 --> 27:42.989
We're hydrating like crazy
and his blood pressure's not moving.

27:43.193 --> 27:46.185
Order LFTs, BUN and creatinine.

27:46.796 --> 27:48.127
His friend's here.

27:48.331 --> 27:50.356
He says the guy didn't have
that much to drink.

27:50.567 --> 27:52.899
And the Cubs are a shoo-in
for the pennant.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.133
Elliot, this is Dr. Lewis.

27:55.337 --> 27:57.066
How much did Mr. Quinn drink?

27:57.406 --> 28:00.136
We were playing this game,
Whale's Tales.

28:00.343 --> 28:03.004
You say numbers. If you
can't remember them, you drink.

28:03.212 --> 28:04.509
How much did Mr. Quinn drink?

28:04.713 --> 28:08.443
Listen, his father's an assistant dean.
If he finds out about...

28:08.649 --> 28:11.414
What was he drinking and how much?

28:12.720 --> 28:13.812
Beer.

28:14.422 --> 28:16.322
Beer and shots of tequila.

28:16.524 --> 28:18.651
He must've had 15, 20 shots.

28:18.859 --> 28:20.487
- Did he do any drugs?
- No.

28:22.130 --> 28:24.427
- Will he be all right?
- I hope so.

28:29.269 --> 28:30.930
Blood alcohol's back,
.832.

28:31.271 --> 28:34.672
Call Dialysis. Let them know
we're on the way. Let's move him.

28:42.414 --> 28:44.745
- Mrs. Gasner?
- I'm Elaine Gasner.

28:44.950 --> 28:46.076
This is Sarah.

28:46.285 --> 28:48.582
Hi, Sarah. I'm Dr. Greene.

28:51.724 --> 28:53.281
Sit down, honey.

28:58.029 --> 28:59.758
Where's my husband? Can I see him?

28:59.964 --> 29:01.157
He's sleeping.

29:01.966 --> 29:04.934
I need to tell you about his condition.

29:06.237 --> 29:08.864
His heart muscle is badly deteriorated.

29:09.473 --> 29:11.668
They said he could get a transplant.

29:11.875 --> 29:15.674
If there was one available.
There isn't one tonight.

29:15.945 --> 29:17.742
He can wait till they find one.

29:20.116 --> 29:22.346
Your husband's heart is failing.

29:24.821 --> 29:26.720
Unless we find a heart donor...

29:26.922 --> 29:31.086
...in the next couple of hours, I don't
believe he'll make it through the night.

29:34.963 --> 29:36.157
I'm sorry.

30:01.288 --> 30:02.276
Sam?

30:06.826 --> 30:07.884
Mark...

30:08.228 --> 30:09.717
Your wife and daughter are here.

30:10.663 --> 30:12.392
I was thinking...

30:15.534 --> 30:17.058
Did you hear the one...

30:18.570 --> 30:21.061
...about the guy on the country road?

30:23.741 --> 30:25.436
Flat tire.

30:27.045 --> 30:29.013
Doesn't have a jack...

30:35.953 --> 30:37.283
Never mind.

30:41.626 --> 30:43.354
You think you can avoid it.

30:44.594 --> 30:46.425
It all counts.

30:47.563 --> 30:49.758
Decisions you don't make.

30:53.669 --> 30:55.534
The real joke is...

30:58.439 --> 31:00.600
...l'm still gonna die.

31:03.913 --> 31:05.937
I guess I'm getting ready for it.

31:13.788 --> 31:15.049
I'm not ready.

31:17.457 --> 31:19.220
Damn it, I'm not!

31:22.130 --> 31:23.994
I don't want to leave them.

31:26.767 --> 31:28.462
Sarah needs me.

31:49.287 --> 31:51.312
Could you please have my wife...

31:53.590 --> 31:55.581
...bring Sarah in?

31:56.795 --> 31:57.783
Sure.

32:10.006 --> 32:11.065
Don't say it.

32:11.275 --> 32:12.263
What?

32:14.010 --> 32:16.444
That I should be grateful to be alive.

32:17.747 --> 32:19.578
That's not what I was thinking.

32:22.552 --> 32:24.213
What were you thinking?

32:27.322 --> 32:28.550
I don't know.

32:39.967 --> 32:41.935
Is there any chance?

32:42.370 --> 32:44.862
Type A, negative cross-match.

32:45.072 --> 32:48.508
Forty-three years old.
He can handle the surgery.

32:49.410 --> 32:51.708
It just seems that marriage
should be easier.

32:51.912 --> 32:53.607
I never heard it called easy.

32:53.814 --> 32:57.010
Sometimes I think we did it
just to make our parents happy.

32:57.217 --> 32:59.583
- You're good at making people happy.
- Not this week.

33:01.187 --> 33:02.176
What?

33:03.089 --> 33:05.023
How soon will you know?

33:05.959 --> 33:10.759
A 19-year-old flatline EEG. Can't find
the parents to sign a release.

33:12.898 --> 33:14.695
What'll you do about Milwaukee?

33:14.933 --> 33:17.697
I could be a junior resident
at a suburban hospital.

33:20.471 --> 33:21.995
That'd do wonders for your career.

33:23.208 --> 33:24.697
It all counts.

33:25.543 --> 33:26.532
What?

33:27.311 --> 33:28.300
Nothing.

33:28.513 --> 33:30.912
Your dialysis kid's coming around.

33:31.114 --> 33:32.104
Good.

33:41.957 --> 33:45.916
Well, can you keep trying?
I need that heart.

33:46.496 --> 33:47.484
Thanks.

33:51.200 --> 33:55.159
Can you do me a favor and get a hotel
for Mrs. Gasner and her daughter?

33:55.371 --> 33:56.360
Sure.

33:58.207 --> 34:00.038
You okay, Dr. Greene?

34:00.708 --> 34:03.199
I'm fine, Jerry. Thanks.

34:09.016 --> 34:10.348
Dr. Ross?

34:10.918 --> 34:14.911
Lydia, what is a seven letter word
for "dumb," beginning with an "M"?

34:15.856 --> 34:18.257
"Moronic." Your asthma patient's back.

34:23.864 --> 34:26.297
- She tried to sleep...
- Where's the inhaler?

34:26.498 --> 34:27.931
I didn't get it.

34:29.469 --> 34:33.701
She's having another attack. I told you
to fill out that prescription tonight.

34:33.906 --> 34:36.373
She could've died. You understand that?

34:36.708 --> 34:38.472
The medicine costs $30.

34:38.677 --> 34:42.136
I don't have the money.
Medicaid don't come for another week.

34:48.219 --> 34:49.380
I'll be back.

34:55.525 --> 34:57.050
Do we have a spare inhaler?

34:57.261 --> 34:59.889
Just the one.
If he's that bad, he should come in.

35:01.699 --> 35:03.724
- What about Proventil samples?
- Nope.

35:03.934 --> 35:05.993
We can't diagnose over the phone.

35:06.202 --> 35:08.796
If that's what you want to do.
Thank you.

35:09.106 --> 35:11.370
- Prednisone, any of that?
- Plenty.

35:12.475 --> 35:13.443
On the top shelf.

35:16.312 --> 35:18.542
It'll take more
to get her through the week.

35:18.748 --> 35:20.874
You seem very interested.
She must be pretty.

35:21.083 --> 35:22.517
She's 12.

35:23.485 --> 35:25.419
I'll see what else I can turn up.

35:29.258 --> 35:30.987
Jerry, I don't get it.

35:31.193 --> 35:34.218
I sent that Gram stain ages ago,
and it's not back yet?

35:35.030 --> 35:37.294
- Who was that for again?
- Mine. For me.

35:37.498 --> 35:39.796
Oh, yes. It came in about three.

35:40.001 --> 35:41.593
Where is it, Jerry?

35:42.403 --> 35:43.927
Bulletin board.

35:47.140 --> 35:48.573
Excuse me.

35:58.118 --> 35:59.414
You gotta do something.

35:59.685 --> 36:01.414
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

36:06.626 --> 36:09.150
We wouldn't want that.
Not here in the hall.

36:11.063 --> 36:12.256
Come with me.

36:14.098 --> 36:15.259
Hi, John.

36:33.951 --> 36:35.816
Hi, Puppy.

36:37.087 --> 36:39.180
You're up pretty late.

36:40.089 --> 36:42.455
I fell asleep on the plane.

36:42.659 --> 36:44.125
Did you have fun with Grandma?

36:45.561 --> 36:47.290
She gave me a present.

36:47.897 --> 36:49.296
Blood sat's 80 percent.

36:49.498 --> 36:51.989
- What did you get?
- Fifteen liters O-2.

36:52.634 --> 36:54.159
A diary.

36:56.404 --> 36:58.702
Grandma made the cover herself.

37:00.008 --> 37:02.636
Grandma likes to make things for you.

37:45.784 --> 37:48.149
My mom says my dad's gonna die.

37:52.223 --> 37:53.383
Yes, he is.

37:57.061 --> 37:59.086
Why can't you fix him?

38:02.666 --> 38:04.793
We can't fix everything.

38:14.077 --> 38:15.407
I can breathe now.

38:16.179 --> 38:17.577
We don't have an inhaler.

38:17.780 --> 38:21.113
Take the prednisone every day
and visit the clinic in the morning.

38:21.317 --> 38:23.148
Tomorrow? I can't go tomorrow.

38:23.352 --> 38:24.410
It's important.

38:25.054 --> 38:27.249
I gotta go to work.
It's my second week.

38:27.456 --> 38:28.684
Dr. Ross?

38:28.891 --> 38:31.359
There's a kid throwing up in 3.

38:31.627 --> 38:33.924
Okay. You're gonna
have to take off work.

38:34.128 --> 38:36.528
- I can't.
- She has to have the medication.

38:37.365 --> 38:39.265
It has to be done, okay?

38:39.767 --> 38:40.597
So do it.

38:52.079 --> 38:53.841
I know, Elaine.

38:54.046 --> 38:55.412
I know.

38:59.752 --> 39:02.186
I forgot a long time ago.

39:08.927 --> 39:11.328
I was always sure of you.

39:12.430 --> 39:14.625
You never let me down.

39:17.135 --> 39:18.124
Sam!

39:21.106 --> 39:21.936
Please.

39:22.140 --> 39:24.199
I have to tell him one more thing.

39:24.409 --> 39:26.604
You have to make him hear me.

39:33.083 --> 39:34.948
Forever, honey.

39:35.753 --> 39:36.742
Forever.

39:38.621 --> 39:40.714
Sarah'll be fine.

39:42.859 --> 39:46.158
Remind her I love her.

39:54.736 --> 39:56.135
Mr. Quinn?

39:57.506 --> 39:58.666
Daniel?

40:01.742 --> 40:03.471
I'm Dr. Lewis.

40:03.677 --> 40:06.408
You're on dialysis
because you drank too much.

40:06.615 --> 40:08.845
Would you blink if you understand me?

40:10.851 --> 40:14.116
We'll be taking that tube
out of your windpipe soon.

40:14.487 --> 40:18.355
Your kidneys are functioning.
Your liver's fine.

40:18.558 --> 40:22.289
And you lost a few million brain cells,
but you can spare them.

40:22.729 --> 40:24.856
Blink if you will never do this again.

40:55.193 --> 40:57.957
Playing one-on-one against yourself
is the easy way.

40:58.162 --> 40:59.093
Here you go.

40:59.296 --> 41:00.524
Here you go. Come on.

41:05.035 --> 41:06.525
Get by me. I'm the short guy.

41:06.736 --> 41:09.000
You said you could've been a contender.

41:11.874 --> 41:13.842
You distracted me.

41:15.244 --> 41:17.075
- That's the game.
- What do you want?

41:17.279 --> 41:19.008
Can I borrow forty bucks?

41:20.316 --> 41:22.510
- For what?
- I gotta run an errand.

41:28.623 --> 41:29.613
Thanks.

41:50.444 --> 41:52.035
Go home, Mark.

43:01.209 --> 43:03.608
This'll get your daughter through
the next 3 weeks.

43:03.811 --> 43:08.407
Make sure she uses the inhaler. Bring
her back if she's not feeling better.

43:11.953 --> 43:13.250
You bought this yourself?

43:18.291 --> 43:20.691
I'll get her to the clinic. I promise.

43:22.429 --> 43:23.690
Thank you.

43:24.731 --> 43:25.993
You're welcome.

43:48.553 --> 43:49.713
Honey?

43:51.556 --> 43:53.113
What time is it?

43:53.323 --> 43:54.915
Seven-thirty.

43:57.795 --> 44:00.729
I was just thinking about Milwaukee.

44:02.065 --> 44:04.032
And I know it'll be hard.

44:04.234 --> 44:06.064
That's okay. Don't worry about it.

44:06.269 --> 44:09.238
But if you want me to go...

44:10.206 --> 44:11.468
...l'll go.

44:17.647 --> 44:18.874
I'll go.

44:22.051 --> 44:24.109
No, you'd hate it.

44:26.221 --> 44:28.121
It's not a big deal.

44:28.323 --> 44:30.587
It's only two hours away.

44:36.297 --> 44:37.820
I love you.

44:41.368 --> 44:42.733
I love you too.

44:43.337 --> 44:45.430
Daddy, you're home!

44:47.741 --> 44:49.470
Hi, sweetheart.

44:50.109 --> 44:51.701
Come on in.

44:54.681 --> 44:55.943
Come here.

44:59.552 --> 45:02.282
I'm so glad to see you.

45:02.954 --> 45:05.286
Daddy, what's wrong?

45:06.291 --> 45:07.816
Nothing's wrong.

45:16.133 --> 45:17.691
Nothing's wrong.

45:21.639 --> 45:23.072
Nothing's wrong.

45:23.641 --> 45:24.629
Okay?
