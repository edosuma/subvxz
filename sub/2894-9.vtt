WEBVTT

00:01.968 --> 00:03.969
(explosion)

00:06.705 --> 00:08.307
(roars)

00:11.010 --> 00:12.678
Captain america:
We've got confirmation.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.379
The city's been evacuated.

00:14.381 --> 00:16.581
Typical monster
attack protocol.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.556
(chuckles)
what's it say about
being an avenger

00:24.558 --> 00:26.958
When the word
"typical" can be
used to describe

00:26.960 --> 00:28.460
A rampaging monster?

00:28.462 --> 00:31.897
(grunts) less talking,
more smashing!

00:34.334 --> 00:36.401
Speaking of
rampaging monsters...

00:36.403 --> 00:39.371
He's just grumpy 'cause
he missed breakfast.

00:39.505 --> 00:42.040
Didn't miss it.
Fridge was empty!

00:42.042 --> 00:43.108
Let me at him!

00:43.110 --> 00:45.644
If I can't eat,
I gotta smash!

00:45.978 --> 00:48.780
Let him out before
he breaks down
the door. Again.

00:48.782 --> 00:49.948
Again?

00:49.950 --> 00:51.116
(roars)

00:54.420 --> 00:55.954
Uh... Oops.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.022
Smash!

01:01.127 --> 01:04.863
Don't you just love it
when the hulk goes
all "rage monster"?

01:05.031 --> 01:07.132
Like we need another
one to deal with.

01:07.134 --> 01:11.570
(laughs) hopefully his rage
will serve us well
in battle this time.

01:11.771 --> 01:13.405
Famous last words.

01:13.539 --> 01:15.006
(roars)

01:19.545 --> 01:20.679
Huh?

01:20.681 --> 01:22.114
(whimpers)

01:23.750 --> 01:24.883
Back off!

01:25.485 --> 01:27.652
Stay on the
big monster.
Incoming!

01:27.654 --> 01:28.887
(alarm wailing)
(both grunting)

01:32.058 --> 01:34.593
Hawkeye: Whoa!
Get off, you big green...

01:37.130 --> 01:39.398
Still a fan
of his rage, thor?

01:41.934 --> 01:44.136
Finish this off,
would you?

01:44.771 --> 01:45.837
(grunts)

01:50.943 --> 01:52.511
Hawkeye:
What's the big idea, hulk?

01:52.513 --> 01:54.713
Did you mistake us
for a full fridge?

01:54.715 --> 01:57.449
I know monsters.
I know when they want
to make trouble.

01:57.717 --> 01:59.818
Takes one to know one,
right? (chuckles)

02:00.019 --> 02:02.421
This one was running scared.

02:02.423 --> 02:03.522
Scared?

02:03.524 --> 02:05.657
What would scare
a giant monster?

02:05.659 --> 02:07.659
(whooshing)

02:08.161 --> 02:10.495
Captain america:
A big tidal wave?

02:11.831 --> 02:13.832
You had to ask.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.782 --> 02:31.716
Iron man: It's not just
a giant tidal wave.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.618
We've got surfers.

02:33.620 --> 02:37.222
Scanning the leader.
Yow! An atlantean.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.924
This guy's not
going to go down easy.

02:39.693 --> 02:45.096
Atlantean? You mean, like,
the lost underwater nation
of atlantis, atlantean?

02:45.098 --> 02:46.631
Yeah, that's the one.

02:51.637 --> 02:53.705
Do I really have
to say the words?

02:53.707 --> 02:55.574
Avengers, assemble!

03:01.781 --> 03:04.516
All right, buddy.
What's your beef?

03:04.717 --> 03:07.219
You will address
me as attuma.

03:07.221 --> 03:10.755
I've spent years
amassing my atlantean army.

03:10.757 --> 03:13.258
Now you surface dwellers

03:13.693 --> 03:17.095
Will experience a true
conqueror's ambition.

03:17.097 --> 03:20.966
So you came to the big apple
to make a name for yourself.
How novel.

03:21.133 --> 03:23.735
I've studied your kind.

03:23.737 --> 03:26.071
This city is the first step.

03:26.506 --> 03:31.576
Soon, the entire
surface world
will fall before me.

03:31.744 --> 03:34.112
Tough talk,
but nobody floods my city,

03:34.514 --> 03:35.981
And gets away with it.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.050
Cannonball!

03:43.656 --> 03:45.524
Now is not the time
to be reckless, hulk.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.126
We need strategy,
not mindless chaos.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.597
Time for a little fishing.

04:01.975 --> 04:06.011
But didn't their boss
just say they came
here looking for a fight?

04:06.879 --> 04:08.713
Something's not
adding up here.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.618
Head's up,
they're going underground!

04:13.620 --> 04:17.055
Iron man, we've got
atlanteans on the subways.

04:17.057 --> 04:20.125
(yells)
I hear you, cap.
Loud and clear.

04:20.660 --> 04:21.826
Subways?

04:22.895 --> 04:24.596
(yells)
(groans)

04:24.598 --> 04:27.332
You have no idea
how vulnerable

04:27.334 --> 04:30.302
Your beloved
city truly is.

04:31.871 --> 04:33.338
(groans)

04:42.715 --> 04:45.784
Jarvis, deploy rubber ducky.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.185
Rubber ducky?

04:47.187 --> 04:49.854
When you invent
an undersea suit of armor,

04:49.856 --> 04:51.957
You can name it
whatever you want.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.952
Iron man: You're running away
from me? Seriously?

05:20.954 --> 05:22.721
You're going to be
so embarrassed

05:22.723 --> 05:24.356
When I post
this video online.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.191
Keep laughing, fool.

05:28.361 --> 05:31.863
Avengers, these tunnels
are crawling with atlanteans.

05:33.866 --> 05:36.735
I need you all down
here, except thor.

05:37.269 --> 05:39.371
<i>Thor, you're our wildcard.</i>

05:39.373 --> 05:42.707
Keep as many of the atlanteans
top-side as you can.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.943
They obviously want
to be underground.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.047
As you wish.

05:51.751 --> 05:52.984
(grunts)

05:55.187 --> 05:57.822
How come thor
stays up here
and has all the fun?

05:57.824 --> 06:00.725
Iron man:
<i>Because thor knows</i>
<i>how to follow strategy.</i>

06:00.727 --> 06:03.128
<i>You just stick</i>
<i>to what you do best.</i>

06:03.130 --> 06:05.764
So hulk smash. Again.

06:05.766 --> 06:06.898
<i>Exactly.</i>

06:07.366 --> 06:08.900
Fine!

06:30.222 --> 06:31.856
(hulk grunting)

06:41.867 --> 06:43.968
Time to put my tech to use.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.437
I don't need a rubber
ducky suit to tell me

06:45.439 --> 06:47.772
They're deploying
in a specific pattern.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.881
Quick, hawkeye,
they're getting away.

06:56.883 --> 06:58.149
Cap, wait, look.

07:03.322 --> 07:05.290
What is this
atlantean slimy thing?

07:05.292 --> 07:08.860
Don't. We have no
idea what this thing
is or what it does.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.467
Iron man, falcon,
are you getting this?

07:15.469 --> 07:16.968
Any ideas what it is?

07:19.138 --> 07:20.739
I'll take a look.

07:22.441 --> 07:26.144
Uh-oh.
Oh, man, I hate it
when you say "uh-oh."

07:27.814 --> 07:31.850
Whatever it is,
there's hundreds
of them down here,

07:31.852 --> 07:34.085
And they're powering up.
Already on it.

07:34.386 --> 07:37.088
Cap, hawkeye,
we gotta get top-side.

07:45.231 --> 07:46.865
(cracking)

07:50.536 --> 07:52.003
Falcon: Uh-oh.

07:52.905 --> 07:54.372
Deep breath, guys.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.047
Now what?

08:06.452 --> 08:08.920
Feels like this whole place
is going to come down.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.089
Yeah, right on our heads.

08:14.360 --> 08:18.062
Why do I get the
feeling you guys were
just a distraction?

08:18.430 --> 08:20.331
(explosion)
and there it is.

08:20.566 --> 08:23.034
(laughs)
I can do this all day.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.404
Huh?

08:26.572 --> 08:27.972
(rumbling)

08:39.585 --> 08:43.087
Ah! Victory is ours!

08:43.489 --> 08:45.223
This is a new one, guys.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.492
<i>Those atlantean devices</i>
<i>have destabilized</i>

08:47.494 --> 08:49.294
<i>The bedrock</i>
<i>beneath manhattan.</i>

08:49.296 --> 08:52.297
This whole island is going
to slide into the ocean.

09:01.907 --> 09:04.576
Shellhead! Please tell
me your rubber ducky
has a built in

09:04.578 --> 09:06.311
Anti-earthquake gizmo.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.214
Attuma separated
the top layer
of bedrock.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.583
He knew exactly the
right stress points.

09:11.585 --> 09:14.018
His devices were
perfectly placed.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.421
Not bad for
a snarling
sea-barbarian.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.256
Try and stay dry
while falcon and I

09:18.258 --> 09:19.457
Get a look at what
we're dealing with.

09:26.198 --> 09:27.398
I hate to say this
to you guys,

09:28.033 --> 09:30.301
But this is even worse
than we thought.

09:31.103 --> 09:33.071
Have I mentioned
lately how much I love

09:33.073 --> 09:35.440
Iron man's gift
for stating
the obvious?

09:40.279 --> 09:41.980
Bring 'em on!

09:41.982 --> 09:44.015
We shall drive
these atlanteans

09:44.017 --> 09:46.584
Back to depths of
the ocean, where...
Iron man:  <i>Thor!</i>

09:46.586 --> 09:50.622
But...
Iron man:  <i>No time for buts,</i>
<i>just get yours up here.</i>

09:50.624 --> 09:54.392
You're our heavy artillery,
hulk. You know that.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.327
Don't step outside the box.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.596
Whatever. Maybe you
can make it back here

09:58.598 --> 10:01.165
Before I've smashed
them all. (roars)

10:06.372 --> 10:08.039
You see what we're
dealing with here?

10:08.041 --> 10:09.407
Can you buy us some time?

10:09.409 --> 10:11.009
With pleasure.

10:12.478 --> 10:14.445
(yelling)

10:24.356 --> 10:26.491
Whoa! How long can
he keep that up?

10:26.493 --> 10:29.127
Hopefully, as long
as we need him to.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.163
Now set your
armor to match my
electromagnetic frequency.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.599
We're about to pull
a high-tech whamma-jamma.

10:36.936 --> 10:39.070
Got it.
And... Now!

10:45.244 --> 10:46.644
Well done, my friends.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.212
Don't congratulate us yet.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.381
My armor's not
appreciating this.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.117
Yeah, my levels
are already in the red.

10:53.119 --> 10:56.087
Not to mention,
this only holds
off the tidal wave.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.289
The island's still
sliding into the sea.

11:03.062 --> 11:06.230
Hawkeye, you take
the south-east quadrant.
I've got the north-east.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.366
Hulk, you...
I want attuma.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.268
We need proper
strategy to
compensate

11:10.270 --> 11:12.637
For their superior
numbers...
(roars)

11:12.639 --> 11:14.372
Not exactly
what I had in mind.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.307
You're wasting
your breath, cap.

11:16.475 --> 11:18.476
Hulk only follows his rage.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.311
And sometimes his stomach.

11:21.814 --> 11:25.083
Captain america: Okay,
iron man and falcon made
some sort of energy barrier.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.584
I can see it a few
blocks from here.

11:30.022 --> 11:33.157
Now we can give
our full attention
to attuma's army.

11:36.695 --> 11:39.564
You think you can protect
your leader from me?

11:39.566 --> 11:41.032
(roars)

11:43.102 --> 11:44.736
Get down there
and see if you can keep

11:44.738 --> 11:46.771
Our big green friend
on our side.

11:47.406 --> 11:49.307
A little teamwork, maybe.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.408
(roars)

11:51.777 --> 11:53.444
Help has arrived!

11:53.446 --> 11:55.380
Do I look like
I need help?

12:05.657 --> 12:08.259
You have yet
to taste mjolnir!

12:08.261 --> 12:10.428
Soldiers, attack
the prince of thunder!

12:10.430 --> 12:14.032
He is but a slave to his
surface-dweller masters!

12:15.300 --> 12:19.337
You want me, brute?
Here I am.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.471
Hmm.

12:21.106 --> 12:22.473
(both grunt)

12:22.475 --> 12:24.308
(glass shatters)

12:26.278 --> 12:28.312
Oh, come on!

12:28.647 --> 12:31.349
We're keeping the tidal
wave in check, barely.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.351
But what about
the island itself?

12:33.353 --> 12:35.720
The shield won't keep it
from sliding into the ocean.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.388
But no pressure, right?

12:37.390 --> 12:39.390
It's like there's
an endless wave
of these guys.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.359
(chuckles)
no pun intended.

12:42.761 --> 12:43.828
(roars)

12:46.398 --> 12:48.699
(chuckles)
you disappoint me, hulk.

12:48.701 --> 12:52.437
You are supposed to be
the most powerful avenger.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.074
Ugh!

13:00.412 --> 13:01.479
(yells)

13:10.222 --> 13:12.123
Cap, what's happening
down there?

13:12.125 --> 13:15.126
The shield's getting pummeled,
and it's from our side.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.361
(grunts) it's hulk,
he's on a tear.

13:17.363 --> 13:20.098
Iron man:
<i>Well, put a leash on him.</i>
<i>This isn't going to work out</i>

13:20.100 --> 13:22.100
<i>If we have to get hulk</i>
<i>under control too.</i>

13:22.102 --> 13:24.402
Thor, they're compromising
the energy barrier.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.437
Get in there,
and help hulk end this.

13:31.743 --> 13:35.279
His ferocity...
Like the great
beasts of asgard.

13:35.281 --> 13:38.683
Cap, I can't just keep firing
gas arrows at these guys.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.387
Iron man:  <i>Hulk,</i>
<i>will you get a grip?</i>

13:43.389 --> 13:45.957
<i>Your wrestling match with</i>
<i>attuma isn't helping anyone.</i>

13:49.761 --> 13:52.530
Is that it?
Are you finished?

13:52.831 --> 13:55.333
Is the incredible hulk
going to surrender

13:55.734 --> 13:57.802
To the superior warrior?

13:59.605 --> 14:01.172
Maybe...

14:01.306 --> 14:04.542
Maybe you're all right.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.444
Hulk, what are you doing?

14:07.279 --> 14:08.412
(yells)

14:16.388 --> 14:17.655
No!

14:17.657 --> 14:18.890
The energy barrier...

14:18.892 --> 14:20.391
(laughs)

14:21.460 --> 14:24.829
I just defeated
the strongest among you!

14:24.831 --> 14:28.299
How much of a threat
do you think you pose?

14:28.567 --> 14:32.170
I don't believe it.
Attuma took out the hulk.

14:39.311 --> 14:40.845
Falcon:
I've done the calculations.

14:40.847 --> 14:43.948
The entire island
will slide into the sea
in 3.9 minutes.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.683
How are we going
to stop it?

14:45.685 --> 14:48.819
Split up. We can
cover more ground
in smaller teams.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.591
Thought you could
benefit from
a bird's-eye view.

14:54.726 --> 14:57.395
Looks like you're
really getting the hang
of this superhero stuff.

15:03.969 --> 15:05.736
Something's got to give.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.441
At this rate,
the battle will never end.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.245
Only because we're wasting
our time with these pawns

15:14.247 --> 15:16.514
When it's their king
who must be dealt with.

15:18.217 --> 15:19.717
Come!

15:19.719 --> 15:21.719
Let's see if you
can do better

15:21.721 --> 15:24.689
Than your snarling green pet.

15:24.823 --> 15:25.957
How's this?

15:38.604 --> 15:39.670
(yelling)

15:40.739 --> 15:41.806
(crashing)

15:41.940 --> 15:43.341
(laughs)

15:44.409 --> 15:45.843
Hawkeye: Cap,
it's about to be
bye-bye big apple,

15:45.845 --> 15:47.812
And hello new atlantis.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.748
I think we've still got
an ace in the hole.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.516
Victory is mine!

15:52.718 --> 15:56.821
The world will
now recognize me
as its new ruler!

15:57.289 --> 15:59.357
You sure about that?
Hmm?

16:00.859 --> 16:02.693
Captain america:
Looks like your water
level's dropping.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.629
But... How?

16:05.364 --> 16:09.600
My army, we must
find the source
of this reversal.

16:09.768 --> 16:12.303
Back to your
underwater posts!

16:15.274 --> 16:17.908
I'm going to go
find out what's
going on down there.

16:20.379 --> 16:21.746
Ace in the hole, huh?

16:30.322 --> 16:32.456
And I thought
I'd seen everything.

16:36.461 --> 16:39.897
Looks like new york's
got a giant, green,
guardian-angel.

16:42.367 --> 16:44.468
Okay, big guy,
I'm impressed.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.070
But I'm also here to help.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.805
(grunts)

16:47.807 --> 16:50.408
All right. No, no.
You got this.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.677
Just hang in there
a little while longer.

16:54.813 --> 16:56.847
(grunts)

16:59.685 --> 17:01.452
The hulk's bought
us some time.

17:01.586 --> 17:04.321
He's actually holding up
the entire island,

17:04.324 --> 17:06.589
Keeping it from sliding
into the ocean!

17:06.758 --> 17:09.327
You're kidding, right?
That's impossible!

17:09.329 --> 17:11.462
No, just incredible.

17:12.731 --> 17:14.464
(attuma grunting)

17:16.734 --> 17:18.836
Did you hear that, villain?

17:18.838 --> 17:21.005
Where is your victory now?

17:21.473 --> 17:22.873
(growls)
(groans)

17:32.017 --> 17:33.451
(yelling)

17:36.521 --> 17:39.023
Attuma, we are not finished!

17:39.491 --> 17:40.958
(rumbling)

17:40.960 --> 17:42.093
Huh?

17:46.932 --> 17:48.065
(grunts)

17:50.469 --> 17:51.736
Hmm?

17:54.940 --> 17:58.776
(both straining)

18:13.458 --> 18:14.992
(laughs)

18:16.763 --> 18:21.966
You were no match for me
on the surface on your world.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.935
Now you're in mine.

18:27.172 --> 18:28.439
(groans)

18:32.911 --> 18:34.545
(grunting)

18:37.449 --> 18:39.750
Sorry, pal.
We're not done yet.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.919
This new armor has got
all kinds of cool stuff

18:41.921 --> 18:44.021
I haven't even got to try.

18:44.823 --> 18:47.091
Say hello to rubber ducky.

18:54.866 --> 18:56.834
(grunting)

18:56.836 --> 18:58.135
(muffled growling)

18:58.637 --> 18:59.703
(yells)

19:01.173 --> 19:02.673
(laughs)

19:05.710 --> 19:06.944
(roars)

19:11.950 --> 19:12.850
Uh-oh.

19:17.055 --> 19:19.557
(roaring)

19:39.711 --> 19:40.778
Huh?

19:47.786 --> 19:48.953
(coughs)

19:48.955 --> 19:50.588
Are you all right?

19:51.556 --> 19:54.191
Forget about me,
we gotta get back down there.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.694
Attuma's way more
powerful underwater.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.028
Hulk needs our...
(attuma shouting)

20:00.966 --> 20:02.166
(shouting continues)

20:02.667 --> 20:03.767
(crashing)
(attuma groans)

20:03.769 --> 20:05.002
Never mind.

20:07.506 --> 20:09.673
(grunts)

20:13.812 --> 20:15.646
You think you've won?

20:15.648 --> 20:16.947
(hulk roars)
huh?

20:19.518 --> 20:21.552
Huh?
(roaring)

20:24.789 --> 20:25.990
Now we've won.

20:26.591 --> 20:28.092
(breathing heavily)

20:28.793 --> 20:30.094
(growls)

20:30.096 --> 20:32.963
Uh, guys?
At ease, friend.

20:36.635 --> 20:38.302
You fought well today.

20:38.304 --> 20:41.071
Hulk, we are not
your enemies.

20:42.974 --> 20:45.743
Everybody just relax.
He's all right.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.045
Right, hulk?
You still with us,
big guy?

20:48.047 --> 20:49.647
How's your rage?

20:51.182 --> 20:52.950
(grunts)

20:55.854 --> 20:57.888
Under control.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.790
Of course it is.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.693
Iron man: The hulk
got his rage under control,

21:02.827 --> 21:04.862
And saved the entire city.

21:04.864 --> 21:08.232
<i>That's why he's</i>
<i>avenger of the month.</i>

21:08.867 --> 21:10.801
Hey, how come everyone
gets avenger of the month

21:10.803 --> 21:12.670
Except for me?

21:12.672 --> 21:14.605
Asgard is filled
with a great variety

21:14.607 --> 21:17.675
Of ferocious beasts,
and I learned early on

21:17.677 --> 21:19.944
You cannot always judge them
by their appearances.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.312
(rumbling)
(hulk roars)

21:21.314 --> 21:22.913
Are you kidding me?

21:22.915 --> 21:25.282
Hey, what's going on
up there?

21:25.284 --> 21:26.951
(hulk growling)

21:28.053 --> 21:29.687
(chomping)

21:31.122 --> 21:33.090
What? Full fridge.

21:33.758 --> 21:36.093
And that's why
we have a hulk.

21:36.328 --> 21:37.795
(chuckles)
oh, boy.
