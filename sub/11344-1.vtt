(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.237 --> 00:06.440
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.474 --> 00:09.243
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.277 --> 00:11.179
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.212 --> 00:12.346
are members
of an elite squad

00:12.380 --> 00:14.415
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.448 --> 00:17.218
These are their stories.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.419
(man)
Open the gate!

00:26.394 --> 00:28.329
So they let you out.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.464
21 years, 5 months,
and 3 days.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.100
But who's counting?

00:32.133 --> 00:33.467
Thanks for coming, Dorsey.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.636
Wipe that smirk
off your face, you bastard.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.138
All these years,
you still hate me.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.807
Hanging onto anger
is really unhealthy.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.210
Your act may have fooled
the parole board,

00:42.243 --> 00:44.145
but not me.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.646
You need to let go.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.481
Not a chance.

00:47.515 --> 00:50.484
When you do it again,
I'll be waiting.

00:50.518 --> 00:51.752
Follow me around
all you want,

00:51.785 --> 00:53.454
but you're gonna get bored.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.589
I've been rehabilitated.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.391
You'll always
be a rapist, Schenkel!

01:01.395 --> 01:02.696
I guess this is it, then.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.632
See you, Dorsey.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.400
Bet on it!

01:23.151 --> 01:24.418
You mind if I sit here?

01:53.314 --> 01:55.449
(Benson)
Tell me what happened.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.886
I spent the weekend
with my aunt in Pittsburgh.

01:58.919 --> 02:02.323
I took the bus back
and was walking to the subway.

02:02.356 --> 02:05.393
And he grabbed me.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.494
And he raped me.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.229
Take deep breath, honey,
it's okay.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.563
We should get her
to Mercy.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.798
All right, I'll ride with her,
get her statement

02:10.831 --> 02:11.865
at the hospital.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.335
I'll meet you
back at the house.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.438
Detective!

02:17.471 --> 02:20.408
William Dorsey, retired,
out of the Six-Seven Squad.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.176
Elliot Stabler,
Special Victims.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.211
You see something?

02:23.244 --> 02:24.378
I heard the call
on my scanner.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.579
Got here as soon as I could.
I can help.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.615
Tell you what,
we appreciate that,

02:27.648 --> 02:28.916
but we got everything
under control.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.251
Thank you.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.752
Stabler!

02:31.785 --> 02:34.655
Give me the time of day,
I'll give you the perp.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.010
(Dorsey)
Summer of '84.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.780
Ray Schenkel and his cousin,
big galoot named Carl,

03:32.813 --> 03:34.515
raped eight young girls.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.916
Took me 10 months,
but I collared him.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.518
You kept the clipping
all this time, huh?

03:37.551 --> 03:40.321
I knew he'd do it again.
Knew it in my bones.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.523
Didn't wanna forget.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.592
You understand.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.727
And now he's out.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.396
Released from Elmira
this morning.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.397
Took the bus back.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.431
Eight rapes.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.799
Why'd he only get
20 years?

03:51.832 --> 03:53.567
We only nailed Grey on one.

03:53.601 --> 03:56.036
Claimed his cousin Carl
did the others alone.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.672
And Carl pointed
the finger at Ray.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.775
Ray gave the orders,
picked the victims,

04:01.809 --> 04:03.010
Carl followed them.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.578
I came out
of Port Authority,

04:04.612 --> 04:07.781
and he was walking down
42nd Street.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.684
He came up behind me,
pushed me into the alley.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.353
Did you see his face?

04:12.386 --> 04:14.054
No.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.725
He grabbed my T-shirt
and pulled it over my head.

04:17.758 --> 04:21.028
I couldn't--I couldn't
move my arms.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.531
I couldn't breathe.

04:23.564 --> 04:24.532
Carl was the muscle.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.699
He'd blitz the girl
from behind,

04:25.733 --> 04:27.935
then yank a pillowcase
over her head.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.371
He'd throw the girl
in their old van,

04:30.404 --> 04:33.073
and then Ray'd let him
have a little taste.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.608
Then Carl would drive around

04:34.642 --> 04:38.512
while Ray kept raping
the girl in back.

04:38.546 --> 04:41.582
Longest they ever held a girl
was 16 hours.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.617
One minute he was
on top of me,

04:43.651 --> 04:46.854
pulling my pants down,
and then he was gone.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.690
Did he say anything?

04:49.723 --> 04:51.892
He'd make them kneel,
say their prayers,

04:51.925 --> 04:55.629
cock his gun,
pull the trigger.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.898
The gun was empty.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.534
Then he'd rape them again.

05:00.568 --> 05:01.669
[coughs]

05:01.702 --> 05:02.803
Ray's your perp.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.506
He may not have left
his DNA,

05:05.539 --> 05:06.907
but he raped
that girl today,

05:06.940 --> 05:08.476
and he'll do it again.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.712
'Til you put him
back in jail.

05:11.745 --> 05:14.081
Or he's in his grave.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.954
The old guy's
locked on Ray.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.523
I don't know.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.725
There's a lot of differences
between then and now.

05:24.758 --> 05:25.926
And Ray worked
with a partner,

05:25.959 --> 05:27.528
he only struck at night,

05:27.561 --> 05:28.829
and he used his rape-mobile.

05:28.862 --> 05:29.663
The attacks are the same.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.799
It's a T-shirt
instead of a pillowcase.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.535
And Ray was at Port Authority
when Kelly Browning

05:34.568 --> 05:35.803
was attacked.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.137
We gotta talk to him.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.706
I'm sending Elliot
down to One P.P.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.107
to pull the old case files.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.042
You and Olivia
pick up Ray.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.111
Corrections released him
to a halfway house

05:44.144 --> 05:46.547
on Rivington.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.451
[knocking on door]

05:50.484 --> 05:52.085
Ray Schenkel!

05:53.754 --> 05:54.922
Welcome wagon?

05:54.955 --> 05:58.459
(Fin)
Paddy wagon.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.693
Whatever it was,
I didn't do it.

05:59.727 --> 06:00.794
I just came back to town
this morning.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.530
We heard.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.832
So where you been
since you got off the bus?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.099
Took a walk
through Times Square.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.436
Looking for a peep show
or a hooker?

06:08.469 --> 06:10.804
I wanted to see the Deuce.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.406
It's amazing how much
they've cleaned it up.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.742
So where'd you go next, huh?

06:14.775 --> 06:17.845
I went straight on out
6th avenue.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.413
Checked out Bryant Park.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.581
Then I took
a little detour here

06:20.614 --> 06:21.849
and said hello
to the Flatiron Building.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.751
You talk to anybody?

06:23.784 --> 06:24.752
And say what?

06:24.785 --> 06:27.521
I just got out of prison,
nice to meet you?

06:27.555 --> 06:28.889
You know,
go into a store,

06:28.922 --> 06:31.158
buy yourself a cup of coffee,
anything like that?

06:31.191 --> 06:34.194
I went to Gray's Papaya
on 8th Street.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.630
Got a hot dog
for 75 cents.

06:36.664 --> 06:37.565
Still the best deal in town.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.067
Also one of the
busiest joints in town.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.469
No chance
they'll remember you.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.905
I didn't know
I'd need an alibi.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.640
A girl gets raped,
and I'm on the radar?

06:46.674 --> 06:49.810
Who said anything
about rape?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.480
Well, I'm a convicted
sex offender.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.914
Round up
the usual suspects, right?

06:56.550 --> 06:59.186
I'm not making any excuses
for what I did.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.988
But I've had a lot of time
to confront my demons

07:01.021 --> 07:02.856
and become a better man.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.058
Or a lot of time for your
sick fantasies to fester.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.128
You the same guy you were
20 years ago?

07:08.161 --> 07:10.130
This ain't about me.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.800
No, it's about
Detective Dorsey.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.101
He got to you.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.102
He doesn't believe
I've changed,

07:15.135 --> 07:17.471
and neither do you.

07:17.505 --> 07:18.839
What kind of fool
would rape a woman

07:18.872 --> 07:20.073
the day he gets out
of prison?

07:20.107 --> 07:22.142
(Benson)
You, Ray.

07:22.175 --> 07:25.112
'Cause there's no cure
for sex offenders.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.547
Yes, there is.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.149
You spend 21 years
locked up in a cage.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.151
Being told when you can eat,
when you can sleep,

07:31.184 --> 07:34.187
when you can take a piss.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.723
Freedom's a precious thing.

07:35.756 --> 07:39.092
I'll never risk
losing it again.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.028
Ray Schenkel's good
at acting innocent.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.530
Well, we can't be sure
he's not.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.964
These cats don't change.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.232
Once a rapist,
always a rapist.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.100
Statistics say
that one out of two

07:47.134 --> 07:48.101
will rape again.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.102
Ray could be a changed man.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.671
Before we lynch this guy,

07:50.704 --> 07:51.739
I want some hard evidence.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.040
Got it.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.241
Ruined my clothes
digging the files

07:54.274 --> 07:55.509
out of archives.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.144
Take a look at this.

07:57.177 --> 08:02.015
Long dark brown hair.
Shy smile.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.084
Tell me they don't remind you
of Kelly Browning.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.052
We can't get tunnel vision.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.187
We have to look
at every possible suspect.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.589
Take Munch and recanvass
Port Authority.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.192
Let me tail Ray
for a couple days.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.629
Detective Dorsey's
got you all worked up

08:15.663 --> 08:16.864
about Ray Schenkel.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.132
You ever consider
that maybe he's wrong?

08:19.166 --> 08:20.534
But if he's right,
Parole needs to put Ray

08:20.568 --> 08:21.669
under tighter supervision.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.104
Craig Lennon
at sex offender parole.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.873
Very tough guy.
Lemme just talk to him.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.274
Fine.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.942
But turn over the case.

08:28.976 --> 08:32.312
Watching Ray Schenkel
is parole's job, not ours.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.614
And change your clothes.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.825
I'm here to see
Parole Officer Lennon.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.695
Sit down and wait
'til you're called.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.612
This yours?

09:04.645 --> 09:07.080
Go ahead.
Thanks.

09:07.114 --> 09:10.083
Wow!
You see that?

09:10.117 --> 09:11.985
Yeah.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.692
Who's your P.O.?

09:18.726 --> 09:19.760
Hmm?

09:19.793 --> 09:20.828
Who's your P.O.?

09:20.861 --> 09:21.895
Lennon.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.196
Oh.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.700
He's mine too.

09:26.734 --> 09:29.670
This is my first report.
Cool.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.806
Any advice
on how to handle him?

09:32.840 --> 09:34.341
You just play it straight,
you don't jerk him around,

09:34.374 --> 09:37.745
you'll be fine, you know?

09:39.747 --> 09:41.982
Where were you?

09:42.015 --> 09:43.917
Elmira.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.619
You?

09:45.653 --> 09:48.155
Attica.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.691
Elliot?

09:50.724 --> 09:52.726
Look, I know I'm late
for my appointment.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.828
I'm apologize, okay?

09:54.862 --> 09:56.864
I'm sorry.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.399
Yeah, you're damn right,
McEvoy.

09:59.432 --> 10:03.170
Get your sorry ass in here.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.772
Good luck.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.076
McEvoy?
Where'd you get that?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.678
What am I,
a mind reader?

10:10.711 --> 10:13.681
What's with the
"I don't know you" routine?

10:13.714 --> 10:15.282
This Schenkel.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.650
We got our eye on him.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.286
And?

10:19.319 --> 10:22.289
He thinks
I'm a fellow parolee.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.892
Are you sure
he didn't make you?

10:24.925 --> 10:28.328
He didn't see me
at the squad, so...

10:28.361 --> 10:30.330
What do you got planned
for him?

10:30.363 --> 10:31.865
Intensive supervision.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.334
Early curfew,
random searches.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.169
No contact with kids.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.905
No car.
That's it?

10:37.938 --> 10:40.207
He has to get a job,
go to treatment.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.876
What kind of treatment?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.277
Eight pervs in a room,
pouring out their guts

10:44.311 --> 10:46.246
to a therapist.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.748
Meets upstairs.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.219
(Pete)
I was convicted
of six counts of rape.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.922
(Zuckerman)
Be specific, Pete.

10:54.955 --> 10:58.058
I forced sexual intercourse
on a woman.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.827
We met in a bar,
I was drunk.

10:59.860 --> 11:00.994
(Zuckerman)
No excuses.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.363
Drunk or sober--
I know.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.198
It's my responsibility.

11:05.232 --> 11:08.235
(Zuckerman)
All right.
Leo?

11:08.268 --> 11:10.337
I sexually abused
three women.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.473
They were my patients.
I was their dentist.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.475
(Zuckerman)
And now our new members.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.744
Ray Schenkel.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.847
I abducted and raped
a teenage girl.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.381
(Zuckerman)
And you?

11:21.414 --> 11:23.784
Elliot McEvoy.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.019
Call me Mack.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.120
Rape Two.
Statutory.

11:27.154 --> 11:30.724
My stepdaughter.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.430
What the hell
are you doing?

11:37.464 --> 11:38.932
I saw an opening.
I acted.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.400
Without clearing it.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.002
Craig Lennon at Parole
knows what I'm doing.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.170
He put me in the group.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.005
You don't work for him.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.340
I'll be sitting around
with a bunch of sex offenders

11:47.374 --> 11:49.242
talking about their urges.
A therapy group.

11:49.276 --> 11:52.445
You're violating the privacy
of every man in there.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.513
There's no confidentiality!

11:53.546 --> 11:55.182
The therapist reports
everything back to Parole.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.383
They know that.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.385
That's not
what I'm talking about.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.156
I'll get him
to talk to me.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.759
Ray had a partner before.
He needs one now.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.862
I'm it.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.331
I promise I'll stop him
before he hits again.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.905
You're gonna
stop him how?

12:20.207 --> 12:23.310
Today you used
the police entrance at Parole.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.345
Undercover, you're gonna go
through the metal detector

12:25.378 --> 12:28.515
like a perp--
No gun, no shield.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.126
Son of a bitch!

12:41.929 --> 12:43.363
Hey, Mack.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.367
Joining me here
at the Ritz?

12:47.400 --> 12:48.969
Yeah, well, I was crashing
at my sister's place

12:49.002 --> 12:50.237
until the next-door neighbor
found out

12:50.270 --> 12:52.239
I wasn't in the joint
for bank robbery.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.473
Your own sister
threw you out?

12:53.506 --> 12:55.175
Punk next door says,

12:55.208 --> 12:56.176
"I'm gonna burn down
your house

12:56.209 --> 12:57.410
unless he gets out."

12:57.444 --> 12:59.913
So what are you gonna do?

12:59.947 --> 13:01.815
The Bible says
to love thy neighbor, huh?

13:01.849 --> 13:03.383
Folks in Cincinnati
still do.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.519
Community got together
and paid a guy like us

13:06.553 --> 13:08.055
20 grand to move.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.024
How about a snort?

13:12.893 --> 13:14.594
I can't.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.164
Staying sober's
one of my parole conditions.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.399
Oh, that's cool.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.400
Plus, you know,
we're not supposed

13:20.433 --> 13:21.401
to socialize
outside of group.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.602
Oh, really?

13:22.635 --> 13:26.106
Then how come Parole put us
in the same place together?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.407
It's cheaper
to watch us, I guess.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.376
Cheaper, yeah.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.377
Have a good night.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.578
All right.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.616
Ray Schenkel
isn't showing much interest

13:36.649 --> 13:38.218
in getting close to Elliot.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.619
Maybe he's not your perp.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.254
Or he doesn't want
a new partner.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.622
Cousin Carl
gave him up last time.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.057
It's safer
to work solo.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.425
I don't think so.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.995
Rapists team up because
they feed off each other.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.863
Ray needs an audience
to perform.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.631
Then why is he
doing it alone?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.901
If Ray is the rapist,
I'd say his first rape

13:53.934 --> 13:55.869
was an act
of sexual release.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.237
After 20 years in prison,
that's a powerful urge.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.638
He gets off the bus,

13:58.671 --> 14:00.640
jumps the first girl he sees.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.075
Sooner or later,
Ray's gonna return

14:02.109 --> 14:03.376
to his old pattern.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.312
It's too fused
with his sexuality to change.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.214
So when's Ray
gonna pick a new partner?

14:07.247 --> 14:08.982
When he finds one
who meets his needs.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.384
Elliot being available
is not enough.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.886
He needs to make himself
attractive to Ray.

14:12.920 --> 14:13.954
Ray is gonna look for

14:13.987 --> 14:15.488
a submissive partner.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.990
One who's a risk taker.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.893
Impulsive, but not
a threat to his authority.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.461
We've gotta give Elliot
the opportunity

14:21.494 --> 14:23.997
to show Ray
that he's the right guy.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.634
Come on, Lennon,
I'm following your rules.

14:27.667 --> 14:28.668
I'm doing everything
you asked.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.638
Why are you letting
this detective harass me?

14:31.671 --> 14:34.107
You have a complaint?
Put it in writing.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.979
Hey, could you
take it easy with that?

14:39.012 --> 14:40.680
See, that's crap!
You're a punk.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.950
Let it go, Mack.
It's just a radio.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.551
Radios don't have
civil rights.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.220
Right, right, and parolees
don't have rights either?

14:47.254 --> 14:48.288
You lookin' for a problem?

14:48.321 --> 14:49.456
You're the one
with a problem, punk.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.391
Get back to your room,
McEvoy.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.459
Now.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.961
Back up.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.929
Do what he says, Mack.
He's not worth it.

15:00.667 --> 15:01.935
Aaargh!

15:01.969 --> 15:04.104
Okay, back to jail.
Come on!

15:04.137 --> 15:05.138
Come on!
No!

15:05.172 --> 15:06.139
This is police brutality!

15:06.173 --> 15:07.140
Shut your hole!

15:07.174 --> 15:08.508
Get off me!

15:08.541 --> 15:10.010
I got witnesses right here!

15:10.043 --> 15:10.944
Nobody's seen squat.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.545
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm not a-scared of you.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.613
Take me in.

15:13.646 --> 15:14.714
Shut up!

15:14.747 --> 15:17.017
Huang wants
to talk to you.

15:17.050 --> 15:20.620
I wanna be pulled out,
I'll ask to be pulled out.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.156
If I wanna see you,
I'll ask to see you.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.691
I need to brief you.

15:24.724 --> 15:28.095
I'll ask for a briefing
if I think I need one.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.097
Elliot, are you okay?

15:32.032 --> 15:33.100
What do you wanna tell me?

15:35.002 --> 15:36.236
The treatment group
meets tonight.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.373
Okay, I know
how rapists act.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.674
Thank you.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.710
In interrogation,
but not with each other.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.178
They are predators.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.313
They know
how to read people.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.480
You're never
gonna fool them.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.082
Or the therapist.

15:49.116 --> 15:49.916
That therapist?

15:49.949 --> 15:50.950
Let me tell you
about the therapist.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.419
Those guys got him
wrapped around their finger.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.620
He's an idiot.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.255
Well, I checked
with the idiot,

15:55.288 --> 15:57.090
and he's administering
a diagnostic test

15:57.124 --> 15:58.125
before the session tonight.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.626
Do you know
how to beat it?

16:01.028 --> 16:02.295
What kind of test?

16:02.329 --> 16:03.997
A sexual interest
assessment.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.099
The peter meter.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.101
Similar, but without

16:08.135 --> 16:10.337
the penile cuff.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.139
He's gonna show you
some pictures of women,

16:12.172 --> 16:15.542
men, small children,
teenagers.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.110
Suggestive,
but not explicit.

16:17.144 --> 16:17.977
That's it?

16:18.011 --> 16:19.212
Okay, so I'll pick
the teenage girls.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.680
This test is a joke.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.083
You don't think those guys
aren't gonna lie?

16:23.116 --> 16:24.751
The test ignores
the numerical response.

16:26.119 --> 16:29.256
It times how long you took
to look at each image.

16:36.563 --> 16:40.500
Okay, what else
are they gonna ask me?

16:40.533 --> 16:43.036
(Stabler)
I never saw Tanya
as a sex object.

16:43.070 --> 16:46.173
She was always
my girlfriend's daughter.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.540
And then there was
this one day.

16:47.574 --> 16:50.143
Rene just keeps
going on about...

16:50.177 --> 16:55.182
how Tanya has to start
wearing a bra, you know, and...

16:55.215 --> 16:59.219
I look over
and all of a sudden...

16:59.252 --> 17:03.290
you know...
I started reacting.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.058
You got an erection.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.096
Yeah, but it's not
like I wanted to.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.230
You know,
it just happened.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.532
Like I was a kid
or something.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.667
(Zuckerman)
But you acted
on your arousal.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.069
Not until she was 13.

17:16.103 --> 17:19.106
You know, and...

17:19.139 --> 17:21.841
She started going online.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.311
And, um...

17:24.344 --> 17:28.281
I'd send her emails.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.183
And she'd flirt
with me.

17:30.217 --> 17:35.522
All these questions
about boys and sex.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.426
It just seemed like
she wanted me to do it.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.161
That's a cop-out.

17:41.194 --> 17:44.231
She's a kid.
You had sex with her.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.865
It's wrong.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.200
Don't you think
I know that?

17:47.234 --> 17:48.235
I went to prison
for what I did.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.236
You went to prison

17:49.269 --> 17:50.737
because you got caught.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.673
And since your arrest,

17:53.706 --> 17:58.278
have you been thinking
about your stepdaughter?

18:08.255 --> 18:13.160
I just remember kissing her
and touching her.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.562
Just can't make
those memories go away.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.905
I'm afraid...

18:25.938 --> 18:29.242
that I-I'd do it again.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.213
How's that make you feel?

18:42.555 --> 18:45.225
I hate myself.

18:45.258 --> 18:51.264
What do you do
with all that hate?

18:51.298 --> 18:55.502
I get mad
and I want to hurt someone.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.205
If you can't learn
to control your temper,

18:58.238 --> 19:02.442
you'll lose everything.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.212
It's been
a long session.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.279
Next time we'll learn
some techniques

19:06.313 --> 19:08.348
to help control our urges.

19:12.952 --> 19:13.720
Talk about urges,

19:13.753 --> 19:14.854
I'd kill for a burger
and fries.

19:14.887 --> 19:15.888
You hungry?

19:15.922 --> 19:18.658
You really gotta
smarten up.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.327
Remember the rule, we're not
supposed to hang out.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.894
Cool, cool.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.263
Guess you don't
want a ride, either.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.597
What, you got a car?

19:26.766 --> 19:29.902
A loaner from the body shop
that I'm working at.

19:29.936 --> 19:30.937
What can I tell ya?

19:30.970 --> 19:34.774
I had to pick up stuff
from my sister's house.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.512
What the hell?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.850
How'd you get a job
with a sheet like yours?

19:43.883 --> 19:46.553
My sister made
her husband hire me.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.820
He didn't want to,
but, you know,

19:47.854 --> 19:49.689
I can rebuild a transmission
better than him.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.794
Lennon won't let me
own a car.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.797
Ballbuster won't let me
use a computer.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.299
Least I can drive.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.534
I tell you, a couple more
paychecks, though,

20:01.568 --> 20:03.470
I'm getting me some wheels.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.938
Oh yeah?
You got your eyes on something?

20:05.972 --> 20:07.740
Some crappy four-doors.

20:07.774 --> 20:08.908
Panel van.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.877
Camaro.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.779
How much?

20:12.812 --> 20:14.814
800, 900.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.552
I could lend it to you.

20:19.586 --> 20:20.953
I got an uncle who died,
left me some money.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.861
And you're just gonna
trust me

20:28.895 --> 20:29.729
to pay you back, huh?

20:29.762 --> 20:32.265
It's not like
you're gonna rip me off.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.501
I know where you live.

20:34.534 --> 20:35.835
Get the van.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.304
We could have
a good time with it.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.939
You're not a fag, are you?

20:39.972 --> 20:42.642
No.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.011
I thought we could use it
to pick up some girls.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.787
You in?

20:59.926 --> 21:02.762
Oh, yeah.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.344
(Benson)
What's with the van?

21:17.377 --> 21:19.045
Ray gave me
the money to buy it.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.580
That's enough
to violate Ray's parole,

21:20.613 --> 21:21.614
send him back to prison.

21:21.648 --> 21:22.615
For 18 months?

21:22.649 --> 21:24.651
What? You gonna give him
the van?

21:24.684 --> 21:25.952
I'm not gonna
give him the keys.

21:25.985 --> 21:29.889
I'm just...giving him
an opportunity.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.524
You'd have to let Ray
go far enough

21:31.558 --> 21:32.559
to charge him
with attempted rape.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.727
We'd be responsible
for traumatizing the girl.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.429
We could use
a female undercover

21:36.463 --> 21:37.497
as a decoy.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.631
Ray likes 'em young.

21:38.665 --> 21:41.100
We just need to find a cop
who can pass for a teenager.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.803
All right.

21:43.836 --> 21:44.637
But I want safeguards.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.339
You put all
the bells and whistles

21:46.373 --> 21:47.607
on that van.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.511
Looks good!

21:51.544 --> 21:52.745
Looks like crap.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.647
No one's gonna give it
a second glance.

21:54.681 --> 21:55.448
Cold plates.

21:55.482 --> 21:56.849
If Ray gets someone
to run 'em,

21:56.883 --> 21:58.885
it comes back to a body shop
in Hunt's Point.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.721
License and registration
under your new alias.

22:01.754 --> 22:02.789
Check this out.

22:04.791 --> 22:05.825
Bird dog?

22:05.858 --> 22:07.059
GPS transponder.

22:07.093 --> 22:09.529
Feeds the van's location
to the squad computers

22:09.562 --> 22:10.730
or a handheld.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.732
Three fiber optic cameras.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.501
There, there, and there.

22:14.534 --> 22:15.768
Plus mics.

22:15.802 --> 22:16.836
Real time?
No.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.605
But they all dump
to digital tape.

22:18.638 --> 22:19.906
And that's not all.

22:19.939 --> 22:23.410
I got Ryan to hook up
a little insurance policy.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.613
Turn the AC on,
audio preset five,

22:26.646 --> 22:27.980
left turn signal.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.617
Check the trap.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.785
Throw down.

22:32.819 --> 22:35.154
Can't drive around
unprotected.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.690
Ray's gonna dig this.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.894
[horn honking]

22:44.531 --> 22:47.033
Go for a ride?

22:49.602 --> 22:52.038
Let's break her in.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.840
Where to?

22:53.873 --> 22:56.776
Go west, young man.

23:00.179 --> 23:01.914
(Benson)
They're on the move.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.117
Heading east on Houston.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.619
(Cragen on radio)
Copy that.

23:06.653 --> 23:09.388
I'll get ahead of 'em
and drop the decoy.

23:25.472 --> 23:26.906
We could go out
to the Rockaways,

23:26.939 --> 23:29.542
maybe Jones Beach.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.578
Stay in closer,
maybe hit Coney Island.

23:31.611 --> 23:32.845
Check out the Boardwalk.

23:32.879 --> 23:33.880
Check her out.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.951
That's hot.

23:46.559 --> 23:49.629
Fox is in the henhouse.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.464
He's spotted her.

23:51.498 --> 23:53.633
Maintain visual contact.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.768
(Benson)
Copy that.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.174
Speed up.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.744
How come?
Just do it.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.078
Pull over at
this corner over here.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.852
They're stopping
at Houston and Orchard.

24:14.220 --> 24:17.156
Keep going.
I got the eyeball.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.165
What are we gonna do?
Sit here all day?

24:26.198 --> 24:28.067
Shut up.

24:39.612 --> 24:40.780
He's going for it.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.809
Let's go!

25:09.842 --> 25:11.711
Where?

25:11.744 --> 25:13.613
Group.

25:13.646 --> 25:14.714
Come on,
I don't wanna be late.

25:14.747 --> 25:17.516
Let's go.

25:20.687 --> 25:21.721
(Cragen)
I'm pulling Elliot out.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.756
Captain, trust his instincts.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.558
I did.
He was wrong.

25:25.592 --> 25:26.993
Ray still could have
raped the girl

25:27.026 --> 25:28.260
at the bus station.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.328
And he could rape again.

25:29.361 --> 25:32.098
We dangled some beautiful bait
in front of his nose,

25:32.131 --> 25:33.165
and he walked away.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.901
He could have made
Lucy as a cop.

25:34.934 --> 25:37.704
And maybe
he's not a rapist anymore.

25:37.737 --> 25:40.039
If he has changed,
baiting him is like

25:40.072 --> 25:41.574
putting a bottle of scotch
in front of a guy

25:41.608 --> 25:42.775
with two weeks sobriety.

25:42.809 --> 25:45.978
Elliot isn't encouraging him
to do it.

25:46.012 --> 25:48.314
Captain, recovery is the same
for alcoholics

25:48.347 --> 25:49.916
or for sex offenders.

25:49.949 --> 25:51.784
Some people have
the willpower to change,

25:51.818 --> 25:52.852
others don't.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.287
And that makes
what we're doing okay?

25:55.321 --> 25:57.624
If Ray's rehabilitated,
I will be the first one

25:57.657 --> 25:58.991
to apologize.

25:59.025 --> 26:01.260
But if he's still a rapist...

26:01.293 --> 26:02.929
we have to stop him.

26:05.264 --> 26:10.202
You gotta leave Elliot in.

26:10.236 --> 26:13.239
I went to see
my old girlfriend.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.207
We were hanging out.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.910
She was smiling,
touching me on the arm.

26:17.944 --> 26:22.615
And I went to kiss her,
and she shoved me away.

26:22.649 --> 26:24.150
Told me she didn't have
those kind of feelings

26:24.183 --> 26:25.718
for me anymore.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.353
(Zuckerman)
How'd that make you feel?

26:27.386 --> 26:28.354
I wanted to hit her.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.322
What'd you do?

26:30.356 --> 26:31.290
I left.

26:31.323 --> 26:32.291
Controlled your impulses.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.894
Good work, Pete.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.062
Anyone want to comment?

26:36.095 --> 26:39.365
Mack?

26:39.398 --> 26:40.733
No, I don't feel
like talking.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.906
What Pete says
make me feel hopeful.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.240
I know that coming here
won't stop me

26:48.274 --> 26:50.242
from having the desires,

26:50.276 --> 26:51.343
but it'll help me
control 'em.

26:53.746 --> 26:56.282
Well, whenever you have
inappropriate fantasies,

26:56.315 --> 26:58.417
imagine it's being
broadcast from your mind

26:58.450 --> 27:00.219
and everyone around
can hear you.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.954
McEvoy, I want to see you
in my office.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.356
Oh, I gotta go.
Stay.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.893
Or you'll be in violation
of your parole.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.300
Mack, you can't
just show up.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.401
You have to participate
in group.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.136
Yeah, I gotta talk more.
I got it.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.170
I don't think you do.
Have a seat.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.205
I really gotta
get out of here.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.173
Sit down.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.848
What's going on?

27:31.317 --> 27:32.351
Got a lot on my mind.

27:32.384 --> 27:34.420
I can see
you're under pressure.

27:34.453 --> 27:37.323
And I'm handling it.

27:37.356 --> 27:38.925
You have someone
you can lean on?

27:38.958 --> 27:39.992
Family?

27:42.394 --> 27:44.731
No.

27:44.764 --> 27:45.798
You can't fight
your battle alone.

27:45.832 --> 27:47.266
That's why
you're in group.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.035
So you can talk
about your problems

27:49.068 --> 27:51.370
so you don't act them out.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.039
Well, you know,
that's not how I was raised.

27:53.072 --> 27:55.775
Now, my P.O. sends me here,
so I'm here, okay?

27:55.808 --> 27:56.876
I'm here.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.811
When you're not in charge,

27:58.845 --> 28:00.980
you get angrier
than most people.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.719
Mack...

28:06.753 --> 28:10.222
rage and lust are
hungry beasts inside of us.

28:10.256 --> 28:14.226
The more we feed them,
the stronger they get.

28:14.260 --> 28:19.631
Stop fighting things
you can't change.

28:23.502 --> 28:25.905
Hey, Mack!

28:25.938 --> 28:27.239
What the hell
are you still doing here?

28:27.273 --> 28:29.241
That friggin' shrink
kept me in there forever.

28:29.275 --> 28:31.310
Yeah, I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

28:31.343 --> 28:32.945
Guy's got a hard-on for you.

28:32.979 --> 28:34.847
Yeah, I can handle him.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.182
You know it's almost curfew?

28:36.215 --> 28:37.316
I mean, I got an excuse,

28:37.349 --> 28:39.251
but they're gonna put your ass
in a sling if you're late.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.487
Not the way I drive.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.489
Give me the keys.

28:46.258 --> 28:47.726
Keys!

28:50.162 --> 28:52.498
All right.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.408
A little hopped up there,
my friend.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.344
I've planned
some relaxation.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.513
What's with the piece?

29:07.546 --> 29:10.382
I got it from a guy
in a bar down the street.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.251
I had a drink
while I was waiting for you.

29:12.284 --> 29:14.420
Oh, yeah?
Fell off the wagon.

29:14.453 --> 29:17.223
It's time for you and I
to have some fun.

29:20.559 --> 29:21.994
Take a look in back.

29:26.298 --> 29:29.501
[muffled crying]

29:36.075 --> 29:39.145
[engine starts]

29:46.452 --> 29:47.854
(Fin)
Captain, something's up.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.288
Elliot just drove past
the halfway house

29:49.321 --> 29:50.556
and didn't stop.

29:50.589 --> 29:51.858
What's his position?

29:51.891 --> 29:52.959
Eastbound on Delancy Street.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.226
What's going on?

29:54.260 --> 29:55.962
Not sure.

29:55.995 --> 29:59.431
(Fin)
The van's heading
for the river.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.067
And over the
Williamsburg Bridge.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.268
Go.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.987
Ho, ho, van's stopped.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.254
We're way out
in the boondocks.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.323
They're not taking
a joy ride.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.225
What is this place?

30:26.258 --> 30:28.995
Remember I told you about
my uncle who died?

30:29.028 --> 30:29.996
This is his factory.

30:30.029 --> 30:33.099
Used to make machine parts.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.501
Give me a hand over here.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.603
I'll be right there.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.109
This is my play.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.111
You do as you're told,
understand?

30:45.144 --> 30:46.145
Yeah.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.989
What'd you do, pick the lock
to get in here?

30:57.023 --> 30:59.191
Boy, are you a genius.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.143
Put her down here.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.414
What now?

31:28.220 --> 31:29.321
You go first.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.893
Well, you know,
you found her.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.165
I wanna watch.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.071
(Benson)
Take the next left.

31:45.104 --> 31:48.007
They're about
a mile and a half up ahead.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.042
So what's the problem?
Don't you like her?

31:50.076 --> 31:51.510
No, she's good.

31:51.543 --> 31:54.146
Well, then,
what's the hold-up?

31:57.016 --> 31:59.285
I...

31:59.318 --> 32:01.087
I can't do this
in front of another guy.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.221
That's all.

32:07.726 --> 32:10.129
Performance anxiety.

32:10.162 --> 32:13.165
It happens to the best of us.

32:14.633 --> 32:17.970
I'll give you some privacy,
since it's your first time.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.439
Thanks.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.615
Listen to me. Listen.

32:29.648 --> 32:32.251
I'm a cop. I'm a cop.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.486
I know you're scared,
but you gotta listen to me.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.388
You've gotta stay calm.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.657
You gotta stay calm
and listen to me.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.398
I'm gonna rip the tape
off of your mouth,

32:46.432 --> 32:47.599
and when I do
you've gotta scream

32:47.633 --> 32:49.735
like I'm hurting you.
Do you understand?

32:49.768 --> 32:51.237
Come on.
Come here.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.771
Come here.
Look at me.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.041
Now, the gate over there.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.109
When I tell you to run,
I need you to run

32:57.143 --> 32:58.744
as fast you can.
Do you understand me?

32:58.777 --> 33:01.280
All right.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.481
Okay, you ready?

33:05.251 --> 33:10.122
[screams]

33:10.156 --> 33:11.790
That's my boy!

33:11.823 --> 33:14.593
[screaming]

33:17.363 --> 33:18.364
Run.

33:22.301 --> 33:23.769
Come on.

33:27.573 --> 33:30.576
Come back here!

33:30.609 --> 33:33.212
Aaaah!
[gun firing]

33:33.245 --> 33:35.547
Yaaah!

33:39.751 --> 33:42.121
Go!
Go!

33:45.557 --> 33:47.259
You made a big mistake.

33:47.293 --> 33:48.327
I'm a cop!

33:51.330 --> 33:54.466
I'm a cop.
It's over, Ray.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.370
You think it's over
just 'cause the girl's gone?

33:58.404 --> 33:59.838
It's not over.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.473
You and me,
we're just getting started.

34:01.507 --> 34:04.176
Walk towards the van.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.412
I got backup
all over this place, Ray.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.414
Oh, yeah?
I wonder how they found us.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.450
One gun against 50 cops,
those are bad odds.

34:11.483 --> 34:15.154
I'll take my chances.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.332
You cops are so predictable.

34:26.365 --> 34:28.066
Even if your friends
are outside...

34:30.402 --> 34:32.604
It's just you and me
in here.

34:40.546 --> 34:41.647
We lost the signal.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.115
Could be hiding anywhere.

34:43.149 --> 34:44.616
We're gonna need a chopper
with infra-red.

34:46.385 --> 34:49.255
SVU portable
to ESU truck 5 on the air.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.356
(ESU Sgt.)
Go ahead, SVU.

34:50.389 --> 34:51.790
We need aviation on the scene.

34:51.823 --> 34:56.862
[girl crying]

34:56.895 --> 34:58.597
Fin, listen.

34:58.630 --> 35:01.667
(girl)
Help me!

35:01.700 --> 35:04.503
Somebody please help me!

35:05.571 --> 35:07.539
Where are they?

35:07.573 --> 35:09.608
I don't know.

35:13.712 --> 35:16.782
Wake up, sleepyhead.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.323
Well, let's get this
over with.

35:33.665 --> 35:38.204
I've always been
a great judge of character.

35:38.237 --> 35:41.207
So I've been
sitting here wondering

35:41.240 --> 35:45.777
how I could have been
so wrong about you.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.446
Maybe I wasn't.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.318
Some of that stuff you said
was a pile of crap,

35:52.351 --> 35:56.555
but the rest of it,
that was no act.

35:56.588 --> 35:59.325
I see who you are.

35:59.358 --> 36:02.528
You and me...

36:02.561 --> 36:06.698
we're brothers
under the skin.

36:06.732 --> 36:10.669
People think sex offenders
are different.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.738
We're like aliens.

36:12.771 --> 36:15.874
Drooling fiends
lurking in the bushes.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.877
But we're just like
everybody else.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.679
Why are pictures
of young girls

36:20.712 --> 36:23.615
plastered
all over billboards?

36:23.649 --> 36:27.753
Half-naked, mouths open,
legs spread,

36:27.786 --> 36:31.690
peddling ass
to sell clothes.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.692
If it didn't turn us on,
they wouldn't do it.

36:33.725 --> 36:37.329
You're only doing
what other men dream of.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.802
But your dreams
are much darker, aren't they?

36:43.835 --> 36:45.437
You try to hide
the evil inside,

36:45.471 --> 36:47.706
but I know it's there.

36:47.739 --> 36:49.808
I can smell it.

36:53.645 --> 36:58.717
You lured me in,
you set me up.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.953
You became my friend
and now you're taking me down.

37:01.987 --> 37:05.791
I bet you're pretty proud
of yourself, aren't you?

37:05.824 --> 37:07.326
But your hands are dirty.

37:07.359 --> 37:11.297
You're the one
that gave me the van.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.632
You egged me on.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.634
You wanted me
to rape again.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.869
Don't make this my fault.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.738
You grabbed that girl
yourself.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.440
You can tell yourself that

37:21.473 --> 37:24.776
if it makes you feel better.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.912
But you and I both know
that that's a lie.

37:26.945 --> 37:30.616
You wanted me to do it.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.986
You're as guilty as I am.

37:37.055 --> 37:42.294
[helicopters overhead]

37:48.800 --> 37:51.837
We've got company.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.085
This way.

38:40.118 --> 38:43.054
Stay in the car.
Lock the doors.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.729
I knew you had a gun
stashed in there!

38:50.762 --> 38:54.966
I looked all over
that van.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.034
You've been wanting this

38:56.067 --> 38:57.736
to happen all along,
haven't you?

38:57.769 --> 38:59.671
You planned
this whole thing!

39:04.776 --> 39:08.113
You don't wanna
arrest me.

39:08.146 --> 39:10.482
You want me dead!

39:28.867 --> 39:29.968
What are you waitin' on?

40:07.172 --> 40:09.107
Elliot!

40:14.946 --> 40:16.948
(Elliot)
Coming out!

40:29.127 --> 40:31.663
I'm okay.

40:31.697 --> 40:33.164
He needs a doctor, though.

40:33.198 --> 40:33.264
