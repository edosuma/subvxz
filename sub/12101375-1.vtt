WEBVTT

04:40.018 --> 04:41.063
Here, drink.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.939
Thank you, David.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.854
Have some more.I'’m good.

04:49.898 --> 04:51.378
I got it. It'’s good.Okay.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.167
You okay?

04:58.210 --> 05:02.998
No. I'’m old, and I didn't
sign up for this crap.

05:05.261 --> 05:06.958
Are you trying
to get in shape?

05:07.002 --> 05:08.308
What?

05:09.265 --> 05:10.571
You out running?

05:10.614 --> 05:12.573
Oh, yeah,
just went for a jog.

05:14.096 --> 05:15.576
How far?

05:15.619 --> 05:17.099
I don'’t know.
I wasn'’t keeping track.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.231
Oh, come on, man.
I need stats.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.973
I wasn'’t keeping a tab
or anything, Dad.

05:22.017 --> 05:25.542
Just trying
to get the blood flowing.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.901
Find my lung over there?

05:38.207 --> 05:40.035
You sure you'’re okay?

05:40.078 --> 05:42.211
Yeah, this just
comes and goes.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.474
All right. I'’ll see you
in a little bit, okay?

05:44.518 --> 05:45.910
All right.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.869
You working?Yeah.

05:47.912 --> 05:50.175
I'’m gonna go
by Mrs. Staples.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.655
Then I'’m gonna run
to Fillmore.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.788
You going to work now?

05:53.831 --> 05:56.051
I'’m just going
to run a quick errand.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.661
This early?

05:59.576 --> 06:03.406
Yeah, Dad. This early.
Stop digging.

06:03.450 --> 06:06.278
They got candy bars
wherever it is you'’re going?

06:06.322 --> 06:08.498
I'’m sure they do.

06:08.542 --> 06:11.893
Hey, I'’ll give you a dollar
if you'’ll pick one up for me.

06:11.936 --> 06:14.417
Candy bars cost a dollar, Dad.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.376
Okay, I'’ll give you two.

06:17.638 --> 06:20.554
You know what?No, I don'’t know what.

06:20.597 --> 06:23.905
You make dinner tonight,
we'’ll call it even.
How'’s that sound?

06:23.948 --> 06:26.037
Well, that sounds
like a good deal.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.692
Hey, David?Yeah.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.433
When you get
my candy bar,

06:30.477 --> 06:32.392
could you get some steaks
for dinner?

06:34.089 --> 06:37.135
Uh, so I'’m getting...

06:39.703 --> 06:41.923
the dinner and the candy bar?

06:41.966 --> 06:45.709
Yeah. You'’re a good son.
Almost my favorite.

06:45.753 --> 06:48.233
See ya.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.379
Hey, Dawnell.

10:19.357 --> 10:20.837
Good morning.

10:22.839 --> 10:24.232
Would you hit me?

10:25.537 --> 10:26.756
Thanks, brother.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.983
Can I get a splash
of that, too,
when you'’re done?

10:36.026 --> 10:38.812
I'’d really--
I'’d appreciate it, man.
Just, hands are full.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.079
That'’s good.
Hey, thanks again, man.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.137
Hey, David.

11:00.181 --> 11:01.791
How you doing, Jeremy?

13:34.639 --> 13:35.989
Sorry, boys.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.861
Dad!

13:38.905 --> 13:42.256
Hey, Bug!

13:44.649 --> 13:46.956
Missed you, man.Where were you?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.871
I'’m sorry.
I had some work stuff.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.351
Hey, Dad.Hey.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.918
Did you get doughnuts?

13:51.961 --> 13:54.181
Oh, I forgot.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.792
Where'’s Jess?She took off
with some friends.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.882
Theo! Honey,
you forgot your homework.
Hey, David.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.406
Sorry I'’m late.No, no worries.

14:02.450 --> 14:05.018
That'’s okay.
Everything okay?

14:05.061 --> 14:07.324
Yeah, just work stuff.Okay.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.413
All right, boys,
don'’t be late.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.241
One more
and Principal Andrews

14:11.285 --> 14:13.330
is gonna make me meet him
and make a plan.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.898
You got some--
There you go.
I love you.

14:15.942 --> 14:18.553
Hey, you guys go ahead.
I'’m gonna talk to Mom
for a minute, okay?

14:18.596 --> 14:19.771
Okay.All right.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.907
What'’s up?Oh, nothing.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.996
Just want to make sure
we'’re still good
for Friday night.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.911
Yeah. Still work for you
or you got something?

14:28.955 --> 14:31.783
No, it'’s good. It's good.
I'’m looking forward to it.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.221
Yeah, me too.

14:36.179 --> 14:38.181
The boys said
Jess took off. She okay?

14:38.965 --> 14:41.532
Just dealing with it all.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.883
I think this stuff
is harder on girls.

14:45.623 --> 14:49.714
You think we'’re doing
the right thing, Niki?David, I don'’t know.

14:49.758 --> 14:51.455
Look, the boys are
halfway to school.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.457
You with them is the most
important thing right now.

14:53.501 --> 14:55.764
Right, right, I'’m sorry.
It'’s just--Don'’t be sorry.

14:55.807 --> 14:58.723
We'’re doing what we discussed
and thought was best,
and we said we'’d see.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.247
So we'’re seeing.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.292
Dad!

15:02.336 --> 15:04.338
David, I love you,
you love me.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.688
We'’re trying
to figure this out.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.559
We can'’t analyze
every step,

15:08.603 --> 15:11.127
and if the boys
walk themselves to school,
that'’s on you.

15:20.397 --> 15:21.964
Hey, Alex.Yeah?

15:22.008 --> 15:24.967
What do you call
a pile of kittens?What?

15:25.011 --> 15:26.490
A meow-tain.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.623
Aw, Dad!Meow-tain.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.103
Dad.Come on.

15:30.146 --> 15:32.888
That is terrible.I want new jokes.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.500
New jokes?
You guys tell me a joke.

15:36.544 --> 15:39.068
A dog'’s always
in the push-up position.

15:39.112 --> 15:40.940
Mitch Hedberg.
Search him up.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.943
Mitch Hedberg?
Who'’s that?

15:43.986 --> 15:46.380
A comedian
that'’s actually good.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.556
Oh, the bus is here.

15:49.861 --> 15:51.211
Bye, Dad.

15:52.647 --> 15:53.996
Bye, boys.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.416
What the hell?

17:10.420 --> 17:11.900
Jess!

17:17.471 --> 17:19.081
What are you doing?

17:21.475 --> 17:23.259
Where are you going? Hey!

17:31.006 --> 17:32.529
What are you doing?

17:33.530 --> 17:35.837
Just didn'’t wanna
go to school.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.274
Your jacket'’s about to fall
out of your backpack.

17:45.716 --> 17:47.544
Hey, David.

17:47.588 --> 17:51.505
Hey, Jeremy.
Teenager stuff.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.463
Yeah, thought
I'’d kill mine sometimes.

17:53.507 --> 17:56.118
Hey, well,
if you don'’t see this one
the next couple of days,

17:56.162 --> 17:58.120
it'’ll be our secret.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.427
I got a spot in the back
if you need it.

18:01.732 --> 18:04.996
That'’s a little weird, Jeremy.
Thank you, though.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.609
What are you doing?

18:08.652 --> 18:10.437
Just let go.
I'’m not five. You'’re not five?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.693
I know it'’s not easy.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.312
Mom'’s cheating on you.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.585
No, she'’s not.Yeah, she is.

19:11.628 --> 19:13.500
I saw the guy
leaving this morning.

19:13.543 --> 19:16.677
Jess, we agreed that we
could see other people
during this time.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.332
Oh, so you'’re just
seeing other people too?It doesn'’t matter.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.116
It'’s none of your business
what we'’re doing.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.074
It wasn'’t supposed to be
any of your business.

19:23.118 --> 19:24.989
None of my business?
This is my family too.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.643
But, Jess, you'’re the kid.
We'’re the parents.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.384
We'’ve gotta have time
to figure this out.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.952
That'’s stupid.It'’s not stupid.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.868
Look, there'’s nothing I can
say to you that'’s not gonna
make me out to be a loser dad.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.957
Don'’t say that.You'’re right, okay?

19:36.000 --> 19:39.047
But I'’m not gonna
make your mom out to be
the villain in this thing.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.744
She'’s not a bad person.

19:42.964 --> 19:45.096
Look...

19:45.140 --> 19:47.098
Jess, we got married
right out of high school,

19:47.142 --> 19:49.840
we had you, then the boys.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.712
We never knew
that we were gonna...

19:52.843 --> 19:54.758
question things
when we got older.

19:54.802 --> 19:57.196
That'’s bullshit.It is not bull--

19:59.067 --> 20:01.243
You know, I wish somebody
would'’ve told me

20:01.287 --> 20:03.071
that it'’s never gonna stop.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.812
It'’s never gonna
get easy, okay?

20:04.855 --> 20:06.944
You'’re not gonna
just be an adult
and all of a sudden,

20:06.988 --> 20:09.904
you don'’t question anything
that happens in life.

20:09.947 --> 20:13.473
We'’re trying, Jess,
but there'’s no dadgum
road map. Okay?

20:14.517 --> 20:16.345
Why can'’t you guys
just be together?

20:16.389 --> 20:19.522
Like Grandma and Grandpa!
They'’ve been together
for years.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.571
We'’re trying, Jess.

20:27.922 --> 20:29.228
I promise.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.842
Well, figure your shit out,
because it'’s ruining my life.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.416
You forgot your backpack.

20:47.942 --> 20:51.206
If you want,
we can just pretend
none of that happened.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.296
You know, you can do it
all over again if you want.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.777
Forget the buildup
and the drama.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.520
You know, Dad...

21:03.174 --> 21:04.654
you need to fight.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.136
You need to fight for us.

21:18.451 --> 21:19.843
Hey, David.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.455
Hi, Mrs. Allen.

22:02.843 --> 22:05.280
Morning, Mrs. Staples.Morning.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.542
How are you?

22:06.586 --> 22:08.544
Well, I can'’t complain.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.330
Had the grandkids
over to the house
for the weekend.

22:11.373 --> 22:14.028
That was fun.
But it'’s fun
to send them home too.

22:14.071 --> 22:15.856
I'’m sure.

22:15.899 --> 22:18.467
How'’s your dad?He'’s good.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.991
Just farting around, you know.
Trying to stay busy.

22:21.035 --> 22:24.386
I keep telling him,
we'’re both lonely widows.

22:24.430 --> 22:28.434
Why not jump in a fox hole
together and fool around?

22:28.477 --> 22:32.481
What does he--
Really, you told my dad--He doesn'’t mention me?

22:32.525 --> 22:36.442
It'’s not that
he doesn'’t mention you--Ah! I'’ll leave it there.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.531
Let'’s get down to business.
You mind driving?

22:38.574 --> 22:40.271
No, no, ma'’am.
Come on.

22:42.230 --> 22:45.189
Gonna head down
that road about a mile.

22:47.278 --> 22:49.280
All right, thank you.Yes, ma'’am.

23:19.659 --> 23:21.138
All right.

23:21.922 --> 23:25.447
This is it
in all its glory.

23:25.491 --> 23:29.451
Now I need for you
to get rid of it
any way you like.

23:29.495 --> 23:34.238
You can sell anything
you think has value,
pocket the money, no problem.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.679
What do you think?

23:39.722 --> 23:44.597
I don'’t know,
maybe two weeks,
we can have, say...

23:45.946 --> 23:48.427
Hundred dollars a day
seem fair to you?

23:49.210 --> 23:50.907
Sounds about all right.

23:52.343 --> 23:54.128
Okay.

23:54.171 --> 23:56.304
All right, come on.
I'’ll take you back up
to the house.

23:56.347 --> 24:01.396
Oh, no need.
I need to exercise.
I'’ll walk back.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.745
You sure?

24:02.789 --> 24:05.313
No, but I figure
I'’ll risk it.

24:05.356 --> 24:07.707
You need anything,
you let me know.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.754
Mrs. Staples?

24:11.798 --> 24:13.103
Hmm?

24:15.802 --> 24:17.891
Did you and Tom
have a good marriage?

24:22.548 --> 24:24.898
Well, not particularly.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.033
Why?

24:31.295 --> 24:34.037
Ah, just curious
if you were happy.

24:40.130 --> 24:44.047
Tom was a good man.
I'’m a decent woman.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.920
I loved him.
He loved me.

24:46.963 --> 24:52.752
But a real marriage,
it takes respect over love.

24:54.580 --> 24:58.061
David, love is a feeling,
and feelings,

24:58.105 --> 25:00.542
they move in,
they move out.

25:03.327 --> 25:05.634
You and Niki
will work it out.

25:06.983 --> 25:08.507
Now you get to work.

25:10.987 --> 25:12.815
I'’m gonna walk
on the left side.

25:12.859 --> 25:14.556
You look as you leave,

25:14.600 --> 25:17.733
in case I'’m face down,
dead in the gutter.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.082
Yes, ma'’am.

27:02.011 --> 27:03.056
Jess!

27:03.099 --> 27:04.927
One minute, Mom.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.191
Ah!

27:08.235 --> 27:09.671
Daddy'’s here.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.717
Please finish the sandwiches
and put those away?

27:11.760 --> 27:13.719
Home by 9:00, got it?Got it.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.940
What'’s up, boys?All right, David, let'’s go.

27:17.984 --> 27:19.072
Hey.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.684
Yeah.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.599
All right, y'’all be good
for your sister, okay?

27:24.643 --> 27:25.992
Okay, Dad.Yeah, sure.

27:26.035 --> 27:27.994
Boys, listen to your sister.
Give me a kiss.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.257
I love you.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.780
Hey, Jess.Kiss?

27:34.565 --> 27:35.741
Let'’s go.

27:38.004 --> 27:40.223
Y'’all be good.Bye, Dad.

27:43.444 --> 27:46.403
I'’m sorry about that.

27:46.447 --> 27:49.537
I talked with Jess. She knew.
She just wanted to make a fight.

27:49.580 --> 27:52.279
Well, it'’s hard.
It'’s got to be harder
on her,

27:52.322 --> 27:54.020
being older, more aware,
you know?

27:54.063 --> 27:57.937
Yeah. Plus she'’s a teenager.
Girls that age...

27:59.460 --> 28:01.157
got their own drama going on.

28:01.201 --> 28:03.551
What'’s going on?

28:03.594 --> 28:08.991
Oh, just, you know, one day,
best friends with someone,
next day she wants to end them.

28:09.035 --> 28:11.211
Typical teenage girls.

28:11.254 --> 28:12.603
Oh, right.

28:17.086 --> 28:19.523
You'’re going proper now?

28:19.567 --> 28:22.570
Unless it'’s demeaning, then
you can open your own door.
I certainly don'’t wanna--

28:22.613 --> 28:24.311
I'’ll take the gesture.

28:28.532 --> 28:29.751
Thank you.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.760
All right. Here we go.

28:38.804 --> 28:39.935
Hey.

28:42.851 --> 28:44.723
You mind if we stay close?

28:49.466 --> 28:51.164
I had all night
planned for tonight.

28:51.207 --> 28:52.687
Jess just hasn'’t been great,

28:52.731 --> 28:54.776
and I'’m nervous
with her watching the boys.

28:54.820 --> 28:57.736
The boys can take care
of themselves. She has to
be there just in case.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.738
I know, but it'’s just
gonna stress me out.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.262
Plus she has that show later
with her friends.

29:07.354 --> 29:09.922
We agreed we were gonna make
date night a priority.

29:09.965 --> 29:14.013
It is, but we also
still have to be parents.

29:18.582 --> 29:19.758
You'’re right.

29:25.285 --> 29:26.634
I'’m sorry.

29:27.330 --> 29:28.723
No, you'’re right.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.248
Life'’s still happening,
right?

29:38.080 --> 29:40.169
You mind if we just
drive around the block

29:40.213 --> 29:43.259
and then come back here,
just so they think we'’ve left?

29:55.010 --> 29:56.751
Thank you.

30:43.798 --> 30:44.886
You warm enough?

30:44.930 --> 30:46.279
Yeah. Thank you.

31:01.555 --> 31:02.904
How are things?

31:03.949 --> 31:07.082
Good. Spent the week
at Mrs. Staples'’.

31:08.127 --> 31:09.693
Nice.

31:17.266 --> 31:19.007
How'’s your dad?

31:19.051 --> 31:20.313
He'’s good.

31:23.185 --> 31:25.318
He'’s funny.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.798
I, uh...
It'’s like the time

31:27.842 --> 31:30.149
between now and high school
never happened.

31:30.192 --> 31:32.716
Yeah?Yeah, you know,

31:32.760 --> 31:34.980
it'’s like my chores have
just been waiting on me.

31:35.023 --> 31:36.720
So now that
I'’ve moved back home,

31:36.764 --> 31:38.548
I'’m expected to
take out the trash,

31:38.592 --> 31:40.942
cut the grass, dishes,
like, whatever.

31:40.986 --> 31:44.119
So, my first night back,

31:44.163 --> 31:46.078
and I can'’t remember
when trash night was.

31:46.121 --> 31:49.908
So, I wake up
the next morning.
It'’s not done.

31:49.951 --> 31:52.519
And Dad gives me
the exact same lecture

31:52.562 --> 31:54.086
I used to get
in high school.

31:54.129 --> 31:55.391
Really?

31:55.435 --> 31:56.784
Yeah. Uh, verbatim.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.264
Except the only
difference is,

31:58.307 --> 31:59.830
Mom always used to
give it to me,

31:59.874 --> 32:01.832
but now it'’s Dad,
and, I mean,

32:01.876 --> 32:05.227
word for word,
the exact same.

32:09.623 --> 32:12.495
I'’ll pull up back here
so they can'’t see us.Yeah, perfect.

32:19.676 --> 32:21.722
Yeah. It'’s all good.

32:27.162 --> 32:29.034
You think you'’ll get
your own place?

32:34.169 --> 32:36.955
I hope not, Niki.

32:41.263 --> 32:43.091
I mean, what are we doing?

32:44.919 --> 32:47.791
Am I delusional
about this whole thing?I'’m sorry. I misspoke.

32:50.664 --> 32:52.013
I...

32:52.057 --> 32:53.275
Um, David...

32:55.277 --> 32:57.845
I just meant that
we could figure it out
if we needed,

32:57.888 --> 33:02.067
getting you your own place
if it'’s hard living
with your dad, that'’s all.

33:02.110 --> 33:04.808
No, it'’s Dad, you know?

33:06.462 --> 33:08.290
I think he likes
having me there.

33:10.727 --> 33:14.470
Not walking around the house
talking to himself.
I mean, he'’s...

33:14.514 --> 33:17.343
still yelling at the TV,
you know, but...

33:17.386 --> 33:19.432
it'’s a little less weird
if I'’m there.

33:28.223 --> 33:29.659
So, how'’s work?

33:32.314 --> 33:33.576
Good.

33:37.189 --> 33:38.799
Some good cases.

33:40.061 --> 33:43.108
Judy'’s letting me do
more work on the cases.

33:45.066 --> 33:47.025
She says I should
consider law school...

33:48.069 --> 33:50.028
though she doesn'’t
want to lose me.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.340
You thinking about it?

34:00.125 --> 34:01.343
Kinda.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.696
I don'’t know.
It'’s only been three months,
so we'’ll see.

34:06.740 --> 34:10.309
I don'’t know if
it'’s something I'll get bored of
once it isn'’t exciting anymore.

34:16.402 --> 34:18.317
No way you'’ll get bored,
smart as you are.

34:18.360 --> 34:22.016
Heck, I wish I could have
had the babies, you know.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.800
Just been
a stay-at-home dad.

34:23.844 --> 34:26.412
You could have gone
and you'’d have
made partner by now.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.849
We wouldn'’t be stressed
about money all the time.

34:28.892 --> 34:32.244
We'’ve always had
what we needed, David.
You'’ve always provided.

34:51.045 --> 34:54.657
So what did you have planned
before Jess ruined it?

34:54.701 --> 34:56.703
Oh, save it for another time.

34:58.270 --> 34:59.880
Come on.No.

34:59.923 --> 35:03.318
I'’ll imagine it now
and we can do it another time.

35:08.889 --> 35:10.630
Tell me a little, at least.

35:11.761 --> 35:14.416
You know, I, um...

35:15.287 --> 35:18.333
started writing again,
you know.

35:19.508 --> 35:21.249
Punk songs?

35:21.293 --> 35:24.992
No, not punk songs again.
I can'’t yell like that anymore.

35:25.035 --> 35:28.648
Just, like,
singer-songwriter stuff.
You know, no big deal.

35:31.912 --> 35:34.088
Gonna go back on the road?

35:34.132 --> 35:37.178
Thought
about giving it all up.

35:37.222 --> 35:38.962
Loading up the boys,
starting a band.

35:40.094 --> 35:41.574
Cruise the countryside,

35:41.617 --> 35:43.489
stop in all the colleges
along the way.

35:45.491 --> 35:48.581
Why not? You'’re still young.

35:50.583 --> 35:53.716
Okay, well, I gotta hear it.I'’m not gonna play it.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.631
-Come on, babe.
-I don'’t have the guitar
or anything.

35:55.675 --> 35:59.200
Well, you don'’t
need the guitar.
You just have your voice.

35:59.244 --> 36:01.855
Your voice is just fine.

36:01.898 --> 36:04.771
It'’s always been the best part.
The band just supported it.

36:06.033 --> 36:08.122
I think the band
helped cover the flaws.

36:10.037 --> 36:11.212
No.

36:29.578 --> 36:35.628
Painted in a corner

36:37.325 --> 36:41.373
The ground was wet

36:43.331 --> 36:48.945
I came to realize

36:50.120 --> 36:54.821
You had already left

36:56.649 --> 37:01.088
A damn fool

37:14.884 --> 37:19.759
You cut me loose

37:19.802 --> 37:24.851
I call this time

37:28.550 --> 37:31.466
Without you

37:33.512 --> 37:38.256
A damn fool

37:45.611 --> 37:49.528
Though all'’s gone wrong

37:55.403 --> 38:00.321
But it ain'’t lost
And I know

38:07.241 --> 38:09.330
And here'’s where
you repeat the chorus.

38:27.609 --> 38:29.176
Shit, shit, shit.

38:49.979 --> 38:51.677
Hey, buddy,
is your mom here?

38:55.855 --> 38:57.726
Oh, hi. Uh...

38:58.379 --> 39:00.860
Jess, right?Yeah.

39:00.903 --> 39:04.559
Uh, sorry,
thought the little guy
was gonna go get your mom.

39:04.603 --> 39:07.649
She'’s not home.
She'’s out with my dad.Oh.

39:07.693 --> 39:12.219
Or, I mean, she'’s inside
taking a shower, you creeper.

39:14.526 --> 39:16.397
I promise
I'’m not a creeper.

39:16.441 --> 39:19.139
Um, do you know
when she'’ll be back?

39:19.661 --> 39:21.010
Are you a psycho?

39:22.098 --> 39:24.318
Excuse me?

39:24.362 --> 39:27.408
Why do you think
I would tell you?
I don'’t even know you.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.410
No, I know.Who are you?

39:29.454 --> 39:33.719
I'’m just a friend.
I work with your mom.
I mean, uh...

39:33.762 --> 39:37.679
Yeah, stopping by really late
to give her flowers.
Real friendly.

39:37.723 --> 39:39.333
My friends do that
all the time.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.727
No, I know. Uh, she just--

39:41.770 --> 39:43.903
Your mom got a promotion
at work and...

39:44.599 --> 39:46.209
trying to congratulate her.

39:46.253 --> 39:48.429
Yeah, that doesn'’t make it
any less weird.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.562
Listen, she goes to work
on Monday,

39:50.605 --> 39:52.172
so if you guys
work together,

39:52.215 --> 39:54.348
you can give her
the flowers yourself.

39:56.089 --> 39:58.396
Actually, do you mind
giving them to her?

39:58.439 --> 40:00.223
Can'’t you give them
to her at work?

40:00.267 --> 40:02.965
Yeah, but I'’d rather
she had them fresh.

40:03.009 --> 40:04.750
Fine.

40:05.968 --> 40:07.230
Thank you.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.233
Nice meeting you.

40:25.858 --> 40:28.034
I'’m sorry, I didn't know
that he was gonna--

40:28.077 --> 40:29.601
No, look, we made...

40:31.211 --> 40:34.127
Made an agreement,
and, uh...

40:36.825 --> 40:38.827
Hey, congratulations
on the promotion.

40:38.871 --> 40:40.220
Yeah, thanks.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.268
Are you seeing anyone?I'’d like to--

40:47.227 --> 40:48.489
What'’s his name?

40:52.101 --> 40:53.494
Derek.

40:56.062 --> 40:58.064
We don'’t work together.

40:58.107 --> 41:00.806
We just work
in the same building.You don'’t have to...

41:02.285 --> 41:03.330
Yeah.

41:29.704 --> 41:31.445
Hide the evidence!

41:35.405 --> 41:37.103
We raised
some good ones.

41:43.239 --> 41:44.937
They'’re worth it, Niki.

41:44.980 --> 41:47.853
They'’re worth us trying.I know.

42:05.914 --> 42:07.133
It'’s Jess.Yup.

42:07.176 --> 42:08.917
I should get back inside.

42:13.574 --> 42:14.706
Hey.

42:15.968 --> 42:17.317
Can, um...

42:20.712 --> 42:22.670
Can we try this
again sometime?

42:23.410 --> 42:24.890
Of course.

42:27.632 --> 42:32.158
Next time, though, a guitar
needs to accompany that song.

42:33.289 --> 42:34.508
Agreed.

42:44.300 --> 42:45.563
Good night.

42:52.657 --> 42:54.920
David! How'’d it go?

42:57.705 --> 42:59.141
David!

43:31.391 --> 43:32.740
You done?

43:55.067 --> 43:56.938
I'’m losing her, Dad.

44:03.510 --> 44:04.946
Let me see those.

44:04.990 --> 44:06.208
They'’re fine.

44:08.254 --> 44:10.865
Why don'’t you come downstairs?
We'’ll clean those up.

44:28.361 --> 44:30.972
Theo! Alex!

44:44.246 --> 44:45.639
What are you doing here?

44:45.683 --> 44:47.989
Yeah, it'’s so late.

44:48.033 --> 44:50.731
I didn'’t get to say bye,
so I wanted to come by and
say good night and I love you.

44:50.775 --> 44:53.647
Okay. Love you too.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.214
Where'’s Bug?

44:55.257 --> 44:56.650
Sleeping with Mom.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.086
Okay.

44:58.130 --> 45:00.567
Hey. So I saw this wino

45:00.610 --> 45:03.309
on the street the other day
and he was eating a grape.

45:03.352 --> 45:04.571
And I was like, "Hey, dude."

45:04.614 --> 45:05.964
What'’s a wino?

45:06.791 --> 45:08.531
It'’s like a, uh...

45:08.575 --> 45:11.317
You know, like a homeless guy
that drinks a lot of wine.

45:12.057 --> 45:13.319
All right.

45:14.276 --> 45:16.539
So, no matter how good
I get at tennis,

45:16.583 --> 45:18.716
I'’ll never be
as good as a wall.

45:18.759 --> 45:20.805
That was not good.

45:20.848 --> 45:22.328
Better jokes, Dad.

45:22.371 --> 45:25.331
Look, if I had
nine fingers cut off,

45:25.374 --> 45:27.986
I wouldn'’t be
any worse at typing.

45:28.029 --> 45:30.118
Hey, don'’t shut--
What are you talking about?

45:30.162 --> 45:32.338
This is your guy.
I looked him up on Netflix.

45:32.381 --> 45:33.774
Seriously?

45:33.818 --> 45:35.950
Yes, it'’s
the Mitch Hedberg guy.

45:35.994 --> 45:39.084
Yeah, but you, like, picked
all the dark chocolates
in there.

45:39.127 --> 45:42.130
What are you talking about?
You said the other day,
you were like,

45:42.174 --> 45:44.176
"A dog is always
in the push-up position."

45:44.219 --> 45:46.265
Yeah, but that'’s funny.That'’s not funny.

45:46.308 --> 45:47.745
It is really funny.

45:47.788 --> 45:49.268
That'’s really funny,
but the guy--

45:49.311 --> 45:50.922
Tennis against the wall
is not funny?

45:50.965 --> 45:52.837
That'’s not funny at all.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.186
Whatever.

45:54.229 --> 45:55.665
You can'’t be good
at tennis,

45:55.709 --> 45:57.755
but not beat yourself
in tennis.

45:57.798 --> 46:00.453
The point is,
it'’s like the wall.
Like, you can'’t--

46:00.496 --> 46:03.151
The wall'’s gonna send it
in any direction.

46:03.195 --> 46:05.023
Yeah, I got that one.Okay.

46:05.066 --> 46:06.720
It wasn'’t funny.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.896
Hey, you wanna climb out
and look at the stars?

46:08.940 --> 46:10.506
It'’s 4:00.

46:10.550 --> 46:12.291
It'’s not 4:00.

46:12.334 --> 46:14.554
Okay, then, it'’s like
2:00 in the morning.

46:14.597 --> 46:15.642
All right.

46:16.686 --> 46:19.211
Y'’all go to sleep.

46:19.254 --> 46:21.604
Love you, Dad.I love you too.

46:21.648 --> 46:23.432
All right, get in.

46:23.476 --> 46:24.912
Go get in bed.

46:28.916 --> 46:30.526
Night.

46:30.570 --> 46:32.877
Hey, tell Bug and Jess
I love them, okay?

46:32.920 --> 46:34.617
Okay.

47:09.522 --> 47:10.915
Hey, David.

47:15.223 --> 47:16.834
Hey.Hey.

47:18.923 --> 47:21.969
Did you wake the boys up
last night and talk to them?

47:22.013 --> 47:23.623
What?

47:23.666 --> 47:25.930
Alex told me you were
telling him and Theo

47:25.973 --> 47:27.932
Mitch Hedberg jokes.

47:27.975 --> 47:29.847
Oh, yeah.

47:29.890 --> 47:32.153
I couldn'’t sleep last night and
the boys have been telling me

47:32.197 --> 47:34.982
to look up this guy'’s stuff,
so I did.

47:35.026 --> 47:38.029
I just went over there
to share some of the funny ones
with them.

47:39.857 --> 47:41.902
Do you think
that was a good idea?

47:43.382 --> 47:44.949
What, you think
it was a bad one?

47:44.992 --> 47:47.125
I think
it'’s a little confusing.

47:51.956 --> 47:54.132
What'’s confusing
about it?

47:54.175 --> 47:58.266
I don'’t know, their dad
knocking on their window
at 4:00 in the morning?

47:58.310 --> 48:00.703
No, no, no. It was 2:30.

48:00.747 --> 48:03.271
And if I'’d have--
No, no, hold on, Niki.

48:03.315 --> 48:05.926
If I'’d have woken up--
If I was living in the house

48:05.970 --> 48:08.407
and I'’d gone in there
and got the boys up
to tell '’em a joke,

48:08.450 --> 48:11.236
you wouldn'’t have a problem,
so why do you have one now?It'’s not about the jokes.

48:11.279 --> 48:13.542
Then what is it about?Are you kidding me?

48:13.586 --> 48:15.370
Am I kidding you?

48:15.414 --> 48:17.720
You'’re gonna
come over here now
and give me crap,

48:17.764 --> 48:20.158
when I'’m living with my dad
and you'’re in there
with the boys?

48:20.201 --> 48:22.595
Oh, my God.

48:22.638 --> 48:23.944
You'’ve gotta be sensitive
to the fact that I don'’t get
to spend time with them.

48:23.988 --> 48:25.511
So I gotta sneak over there

48:25.554 --> 48:27.165
and tell them something
in the middle of the night

48:27.208 --> 48:28.514
and you hear about it
at breakfast--

48:28.557 --> 48:31.038
You are not the only one.
Fuck you.

48:31.082 --> 48:32.648
Oh, that'’s nice.
That'’s nice.

48:32.692 --> 48:34.128
You think--You hear that? There we go.

48:34.172 --> 48:36.435
Oh, my...

48:36.478 --> 48:40.526
Do you think breakfast
is like Leave It to Beaver
or something? You think--

48:40.569 --> 48:42.180
Hold-- Look--
Can you look at me?

48:42.223 --> 48:44.095
You think-- You think
they were telling on you?

48:44.138 --> 48:46.227
I don'’t know.
I'’m not in the house.

48:46.271 --> 48:49.404
They weren'’t, okay?
They were excited, like it
was a good thing, okay?

48:49.448 --> 48:51.319
Like, they were happy
about it.

48:51.363 --> 48:53.669
You'’re out of the house
and you'’re still cool to them.

48:53.713 --> 48:56.455
Don'’t fucking charge at me
like that.

49:04.463 --> 49:08.423
You'’re right.
It won'’t happen again.
My apologies.

49:09.903 --> 49:13.733
David, come on, stop.
We need to talk about this.

49:16.214 --> 49:18.738
David, can you stop
the truck, please?

49:18.781 --> 49:21.436
What are you doing?
What are you doing?Can you stop the truck?

50:42.169 --> 50:43.649
Fucking David.

54:29.570 --> 54:31.746
Hi, how are you
doing today?

54:31.790 --> 54:33.139
Good.Great.

54:33.182 --> 54:34.923
You find everything okay?

54:34.967 --> 54:36.882
Yeah, just looking.All right.

54:36.925 --> 54:39.450
Well, let me know
if you need a hand
with anything.

54:39.493 --> 54:41.756
Anything I can do,
just holler...

55:09.131 --> 55:12.091
Dad!

55:14.006 --> 55:16.051
What'’s up, buddy?

55:16.095 --> 55:17.575
Hi!

55:20.795 --> 55:22.319
How are you?

55:24.277 --> 55:26.148
Good. Can we climb
in the back?

55:26.192 --> 55:28.020
Hey, hey, no, no,
don'’t get in the back.

55:28.063 --> 55:30.501
You can get back there,
but do not go through
those bags

55:30.544 --> 55:32.590
and do not look
under the blanket.

55:32.633 --> 55:34.156
Hey.Could we slide down
in there?

55:34.200 --> 55:36.202
Climb in over here.
The door'’s broken.

55:36.245 --> 55:37.725
Could we ride in the back?

55:37.769 --> 55:39.684
No, you can'’t ride
in the back.

55:39.727 --> 55:41.555
Give me a kiss. Come on.

55:41.599 --> 55:43.601
Just get in and go, please,
and get this over with?

55:43.644 --> 55:45.080
You can if you pay the toll.

55:45.124 --> 55:46.865
I'’m not gonna pay
the toll, Dad.

55:46.908 --> 55:48.475
What is going on?

55:48.519 --> 55:50.956
Load up. Let'’s go.Nothing. Nothing'’s wrong.

55:50.999 --> 55:53.088
Drop it.Something is going on.

55:54.263 --> 55:56.048
Stop, stop, stop.

55:56.091 --> 55:57.789
Whee!

55:57.832 --> 55:59.486
Nothing.
I don'’t want
to talk about it.

55:59.530 --> 56:01.314
If you want me to come,
you'’ll drop it.

56:01.358 --> 56:02.924
Just leave me alone.

56:06.885 --> 56:09.148
All right, scrunch in.

56:09.191 --> 56:11.324
Scrunch in,
find your place.

56:11.368 --> 56:12.456
Guys.

56:14.936 --> 56:17.243
Jess doesn'’t want
to sit in the center.

56:17.286 --> 56:18.984
Come on. Sit down.

56:19.027 --> 56:20.377
Fine.

56:22.204 --> 56:24.424
Who'’s ready for adventure?Yeah, where are we going?

56:24.468 --> 56:25.860
We'’re going to the park.

56:25.904 --> 56:27.427
Wait, what'’s in the back?What?

56:27.471 --> 56:30.865
Hey, there'’s a surprise...Oh!

56:30.909 --> 56:33.781
...at the park,
not just the park.Oh.

56:33.825 --> 56:37.089
What if someone
steals the surprise?
What if they take it?

56:37.132 --> 56:39.221
How are they gonna
take the prize?It'’s in the back.

56:39.265 --> 56:41.180
You said it'’s at the park,
though.

56:41.223 --> 56:43.835
No, it'’s in the back,
covered up in the blanket.

56:43.878 --> 56:46.838
That'’s why
I don'’t want you guys
messing around back there.

56:48.187 --> 56:49.928
All right, how was school?

56:50.842 --> 56:52.365
Awesome.Mmm, good.

56:52.409 --> 56:54.541
Oh, did I get "awesome"
and "good"?

56:54.585 --> 56:57.283
Good. Kinda nice.

56:57.326 --> 56:59.154
I just hate math.Why do you hate math?

56:59.198 --> 57:02.027
Math is the only thing
that ruins the school.

57:02.070 --> 57:04.116
I love math.

57:04.159 --> 57:05.726
See?You'’re one of
the smart people.

57:05.770 --> 57:07.554
Is art the best?No.

57:07.598 --> 57:09.034
You like art?

57:09.077 --> 57:10.470
Art'’s good, right?Yeah, I guess.

57:10.514 --> 57:12.254
Yeah, art'’s good.

57:12.298 --> 57:14.474
That'’s your favorite,
right, Bug?Yeah.

57:14.518 --> 57:16.781
Has he got something
on his face?No.

57:16.824 --> 57:19.392
Art, theater, music.

57:19.436 --> 57:20.872
Oh, you bust your noggin?

57:20.915 --> 57:22.569
Yeah.Running.

57:22.613 --> 57:24.353
You all right?Yeah.

57:24.397 --> 57:26.268
Was that today?Yeah.

57:27.487 --> 57:29.446
I ran a mile today.

57:29.489 --> 57:31.360
Oh, yeah?
What was your time
on the mile?

57:31.404 --> 57:34.233
Um, I think it'’s a ten,
but I was
in front of everybody.

57:34.276 --> 57:36.278
Oh, nice.It was pretty good.

57:36.322 --> 57:38.106
That'’s good.
How about you?
Did you run it?

57:38.150 --> 57:39.194
No.

57:39.891 --> 57:41.240
Why?

57:41.283 --> 57:43.068
I don'’t like running.

57:43.808 --> 57:45.810
Wow.I would run.

57:45.853 --> 57:47.812
I would run it.

57:47.855 --> 57:49.378
I would run it.

57:49.422 --> 57:52.207
How was school for you?I don'’t know.

57:52.251 --> 57:54.993
How was music and art

57:55.036 --> 57:57.386
and recess,
all the fun stuff?

57:57.430 --> 58:01.782
Well, I have, like,
hardly any time with recess.

58:02.479 --> 58:03.915
Well...

58:03.958 --> 58:06.004
Recess is the best.

58:06.047 --> 58:08.920
I have so many friends.
Tyson...

58:08.963 --> 58:10.835
What do you guys play
when you'’re at recess?

58:10.878 --> 58:12.793
Zombie.You play Zombie?

58:12.837 --> 58:15.535
We play, like, zombies.

58:15.579 --> 58:17.842
Oh, wait. Zombies, like,
where you shoot zombies?

58:17.885 --> 58:23.195
Yeah, there'’s these kids
who act like zombies,

58:23.238 --> 58:26.633
then you get to be
a citizen or a shooter.

58:26.677 --> 58:28.853
I mainly be a citizen.

58:28.896 --> 58:31.551
Oh, no, I be
a shooter, actually.

58:32.683 --> 58:33.858
Yeah.

58:36.077 --> 58:38.515
Jess, how about you?
How was school?

58:38.558 --> 58:39.951
Just great.

58:41.169 --> 58:44.129
Who in the vehicle
felt sarcasm
from the last statement?

58:44.172 --> 58:45.739
That was sarcasm!

58:45.783 --> 58:48.350
That'’s just,
like, a tiny bit
or a whole lot?

58:48.394 --> 58:50.222
No, a whole lot.A whole lot.

58:50.265 --> 58:52.703
That was sarcasm.
The whole thing.Yeah.

58:52.746 --> 58:54.966
It'’s sarcasm.

58:55.009 --> 58:56.402
It was nothing that--

58:56.445 --> 58:59.013
It was definitely good.

58:59.057 --> 59:01.363
It was sarcasm!

59:01.407 --> 59:05.890
Hey, Jess,
you can'’t have
a bad time today.

59:05.933 --> 59:07.718
I dare you
to not have fun.

59:07.761 --> 59:09.720
That'’s not the point.Try me.

59:09.763 --> 59:13.375
It'’s the park
and there'’s a surprise.

59:13.419 --> 59:15.639
What'’s the point?I can'’t wait.
I love surprises!

59:15.682 --> 59:17.249
What do you mean,
what'’s the point?

59:17.292 --> 59:20.557
What'’s the point
of someone,

59:20.600 --> 59:23.385
like, doing a surprise
for you,

59:23.429 --> 59:25.953
but then you'’re like,
"No, I hated it"?

59:25.997 --> 59:27.912
All right, you ready?Yeah.

59:30.784 --> 59:33.221
All right, here...
Here'’s this bag.

59:33.265 --> 59:35.354
What do you got
in there? What is that?

59:35.397 --> 59:36.616
I don'’t know.

59:36.660 --> 59:38.792
What'’s on the pictures?

59:38.836 --> 59:40.011
Maybe...

59:42.013 --> 59:43.623
Oh, yeah!

59:44.537 --> 59:46.452
Come on,
let'’s go launch them.

59:51.762 --> 59:53.677
See this little track?Whoa, that looks cool.

59:53.720 --> 59:57.419
All right? All right,
see a slide down on there?

59:57.463 --> 1:00:02.990
Okay, and then
we'’re gonna clamp, go one...

1:00:03.034 --> 1:00:06.690
But what happens when,
like, they'’re going high?

1:00:06.733 --> 1:00:08.387
So there'’s
this little bit of--

1:00:08.430 --> 1:00:10.694
There'’s this little engine
that'’s inside there.

1:00:10.737 --> 1:00:12.434
So, what,
it puts those off?

1:00:12.478 --> 1:00:15.350
Come here.
Yeah, it'’ll shoot it.

1:00:15.394 --> 1:00:19.659
So we'’re gonna stick
this button in here, okay,

1:00:19.703 --> 1:00:22.662
and then you hold
that button. Okay.

1:00:22.706 --> 1:00:25.970
Say, "Houston,
we'’re ready for takeoff"!

1:00:26.013 --> 1:00:29.843
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

1:00:33.325 --> 1:00:34.543
All right.

1:00:34.587 --> 1:00:36.633
Boo!

1:00:37.982 --> 1:00:39.853
All right, go get it,
go get it.

1:00:45.642 --> 1:00:48.557
All right,

1:00:49.689 --> 1:00:51.952
I want mine next!You wanna do yours next?

1:00:51.996 --> 1:00:53.214
I'’m going next, actually.

1:00:53.258 --> 1:00:54.694
All right, let'’s go.

1:00:55.956 --> 1:00:58.176
Come on.

1:00:58.219 --> 1:00:59.830
Yeah, we'’ll pack it
all back in there

1:00:59.873 --> 1:01:01.179
and put another motor in it.

1:01:01.222 --> 1:01:02.702
Okay, could I do one?Okay.

1:01:02.746 --> 1:01:04.748
Yeah, you wanna pitch it?
So, here you go.

1:01:04.791 --> 1:01:07.446
Whoa, it all makes--All right.

Good job.

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:18.196
Do that one.But does it...

1:01:18.239 --> 1:01:19.980
Oh, you could hear a buzz.

1:01:20.024 --> 1:01:21.329
Uh-huh.

There we go.Okay.

1:01:35.213 --> 1:01:36.823
All right,

1:01:36.867 --> 1:01:38.085
Okay, where is it?

1:01:38.129 --> 1:01:39.434
You see it?Right here.

Hey, Jess,

Let'’s get the big boy!
All right.

1:02:32.836 --> 1:02:34.489
You want to hook it up?Okay.

1:02:34.533 --> 1:02:37.014
All right, come on.
Here you go.

1:02:37.057 --> 1:02:38.493
How do you do it?

1:02:38.537 --> 1:02:40.669
All right, so,
we'’ll take it right here...

1:02:40.713 --> 1:02:43.760
This one'’s gonna be big.We'’ll put this one here,

1:02:43.803 --> 1:02:45.805
and we'’ll put it
right here.

1:02:45.849 --> 1:02:48.547
All right.
All right, boys.

1:02:48.590 --> 1:02:51.724
Houston, we are ready
for launch.

1:02:52.638 --> 1:02:53.813
I'’m gonna count yours.Okay.

1:02:53.857 --> 1:02:55.162
You ready?

1:02:55.206 --> 1:03:00.080
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six,

1:03:00.124 --> 1:03:03.997
five, four, three,
two, one, go!

1:03:05.042 --> 1:03:06.260
Dad, it'’s not going.

1:03:06.304 --> 1:03:07.871
Okay, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

1:03:16.705 --> 1:03:19.317
All right. Let'’s go.

1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:22.929
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six,

1:03:22.973 --> 1:03:26.977
five, four, three,
two, one, go!

1:03:28.761 --> 1:03:31.329
It'’s not working.
It'’s not working, Dad.Yeah, no, push this button.

1:03:31.372 --> 1:03:33.461
I clicked the button!Push this button.

1:03:33.505 --> 1:03:34.854
Hey, hold on.I hate this!

1:03:34.898 --> 1:03:37.770
Hey! Hey! Hey, Jess!

1:03:37.814 --> 1:03:39.554
What are you doing?

1:03:39.598 --> 1:03:40.860
Hey!What you did!

1:03:40.904 --> 1:03:42.340
What do you mean,
what I did?

1:03:42.383 --> 1:03:44.037
You got mad
and walked away.

1:03:44.081 --> 1:03:45.865
I did not get mad
and walk away.

1:03:45.909 --> 1:03:47.867
Now don'’t do this here
in front of the boys.
Stop it!

1:03:47.911 --> 1:03:49.695
That'’s exactly
what you did!

1:03:49.738 --> 1:03:51.436
I did not do anything.

1:03:51.479 --> 1:03:54.004
You know I'’m fighting
as hard as I can for this.

1:03:54.047 --> 1:03:57.616
I don'’t want this.
You think I want to bring you
guys down to a park on Saturday?

1:03:58.399 --> 1:03:59.487
Come on!

1:04:00.271 --> 1:04:01.968
I don'’t wanna do this.

1:04:03.927 --> 1:04:05.406
I'’m sorry.

1:04:08.279 --> 1:04:09.976
It sucks for everybody.

1:04:11.978 --> 1:04:14.502
I promise, though,
I'’m trying.

1:04:15.373 --> 1:04:17.070
Take me home.

1:04:17.114 --> 1:04:19.116
Come on. Let'’s just try
to fix this up.

1:04:19.159 --> 1:04:21.161
No, I wanna go home.

1:04:36.698 --> 1:04:38.004
Hey, I'’m sorry.

1:04:44.532 --> 1:04:47.187
Hey, next time, okay?
You get to go next time.Okay.

1:04:47.231 --> 1:04:49.146
All right. Come on,
let'’s get our stuff.

1:04:49.189 --> 1:04:51.452
Let'’s get our stuff.

1:05:01.854 --> 1:05:03.508
Could we keep
the parachute?

1:05:03.551 --> 1:05:05.640
Yeah, you can keep
the parachute.

1:05:05.684 --> 1:05:07.207
You can keep
the whole rocket.

1:05:07.251 --> 1:05:09.209
Can we hang them up
on our wall?

1:05:09.253 --> 1:05:11.820
Yeah, we'’ll hang them up
inside your room.
That sound good?

1:05:11.864 --> 1:05:12.909
Yeah.

1:05:13.997 --> 1:05:16.129
Thank you, Dad.Hey, that was so awesome

1:05:16.173 --> 1:05:18.131
when it went up, though,
wasn'’t it?

1:06:02.567 --> 1:06:05.396
Jess. Jess!

1:06:11.750 --> 1:06:13.186
I hate this!

1:06:14.971 --> 1:06:17.451
All right, here.
I was gonna save these

1:06:17.495 --> 1:06:18.975
till after we launched
the rockets.

1:06:19.018 --> 1:06:20.759
Pick your flavor.

1:06:20.802 --> 1:06:23.109
All right. There you go.

1:06:25.938 --> 1:06:27.244
Hey.

1:06:29.811 --> 1:06:31.988
What'’s going on?

1:06:32.031 --> 1:06:35.165
Hey, Mom,
Dad got us rockets
and Jess broke hers

1:06:35.208 --> 1:06:37.906
and Alex
didn'’t get to shoot one.

1:06:37.950 --> 1:06:40.039
That'’s pretty play-by-play.

1:06:40.083 --> 1:06:42.520
Hey, boys, why don'’t you
run in the house quick
and let me talk to Mom?

1:06:42.563 --> 1:06:44.391
Are we gonna
stay the night?Yeah.

1:06:44.435 --> 1:06:46.567
Just let me talk to Mom
and then we'’ll head out.

1:06:46.611 --> 1:06:48.830
Hey, why don'’t you guys
go to the Thompsons?

1:06:48.874 --> 1:06:51.007
I saw the boys
on their bikes earlier.

1:06:52.225 --> 1:06:54.140
Yeah?That sound like
a good idea?

1:06:54.184 --> 1:06:56.055
Okay.All right.
Go see the Thompson boys.

1:06:56.099 --> 1:06:57.448
We'’ll call you.

1:06:59.058 --> 1:07:00.277
Come on.

1:07:03.628 --> 1:07:05.456
Bye, Buggy.Bye.

1:07:07.458 --> 1:07:08.763
What'’s up?

1:07:09.634 --> 1:07:11.201
What do you mean?

1:07:11.244 --> 1:07:13.638
Jess was pissed
when I picked up the kids.

1:07:13.681 --> 1:07:15.422
She was?Yeah.

1:07:16.989 --> 1:07:19.035
Okay. I asked her
not to be.

1:07:20.427 --> 1:07:23.604
What does that mean,
you asked her not to be?

1:07:23.648 --> 1:07:25.911
A bunch of her friends
were going to a show tonight,

1:07:25.954 --> 1:07:28.609
and she really
wanted to go.

1:07:28.653 --> 1:07:31.743
And?And I told her she couldn'’t
'’cause it's your time with them.

1:07:32.526 --> 1:07:33.875
Are you serious?

1:07:35.268 --> 1:07:37.488
What, David?

1:07:37.531 --> 1:07:40.012
What do you mean,
"What, David?"It'’s true.

1:07:40.056 --> 1:07:41.796
But you can'’t
keep doing this.

1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:44.103
You can'’t tell her
that she can'’t do something.

1:07:44.147 --> 1:07:45.974
It implies that
if it wasn'’t for me,

1:07:46.018 --> 1:07:48.107
you wouldn'’t have
a problem with it.

1:07:48.151 --> 1:07:51.284
But I wouldn'’t.It doesn'’t matter
if you would or wouldn'’t.

1:07:51.328 --> 1:07:54.200
When you say no,
it'’s making this time
with me negative.

1:07:54.244 --> 1:07:56.420
That'’s all
she'’s associating it with.

1:07:56.463 --> 1:08:00.076
So tell her she--
Make up some excuse,
say whatever it is.

1:08:00.119 --> 1:08:02.295
I will not teach our children
how to lie, David.

1:08:02.339 --> 1:08:03.905
Then tell her
that it'’s my decision.

1:08:03.949 --> 1:08:05.646
Say, "Go ask your dad,"
so that I can decide.

1:08:05.690 --> 1:08:07.822
I can make that decision,
Niki.

1:08:07.866 --> 1:08:10.738
I don'’t have to
have you do it for me.

1:08:10.782 --> 1:08:13.437
You gotta be sensitive
to how we talk to the kids.

1:08:13.480 --> 1:08:16.309
This is hard enough as it is.
You'’re not being nice
or considerate.

1:08:17.789 --> 1:08:21.140
I'’m sorry, okay?Are you?

1:08:21.184 --> 1:08:23.969
I didn'’t even think about it.
It just sort of slipped out,

1:08:24.012 --> 1:08:27.103
because if she was home
with me, I wouldn'’t have
a problem with it.

1:08:27.146 --> 1:08:29.105
But then I remembered
that you had them--

1:08:29.148 --> 1:08:30.628
David, this is new.

1:08:33.413 --> 1:08:34.980
This is my family, Niki.

1:08:37.200 --> 1:08:39.158
I know.Do you?

1:08:43.206 --> 1:08:46.992
'’Cause if you're not thinking
about this all the time,

1:08:47.035 --> 1:08:49.168
then you need
to cut me loose.

1:08:49.212 --> 1:08:52.128
Because I think about it
all fucking day.

1:08:55.392 --> 1:08:56.784
This is hard.

1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:01.789
So, if you can'’t find
some way to be considerate

1:09:01.833 --> 1:09:04.444
and we can'’t find a dialogue,
then you move out,

1:09:04.488 --> 1:09:06.185
and you take them
on the weekends,

1:09:06.229 --> 1:09:08.405
because I only
agreed to do this
because you promised me

1:09:08.448 --> 1:09:10.494
that we were going to
work through this.

1:09:13.975 --> 1:09:16.717
This is hard enough
being away from you,
but when I gotta--

1:09:16.761 --> 1:09:20.417
David, I'’m sorry. Okay?
I'’m sorry. I'm sorry.

1:09:20.460 --> 1:09:24.334
Look at me. Look at me.
I fucked up, okay?

1:09:24.377 --> 1:09:27.250
I'’m sorry. Okay?

1:09:27.293 --> 1:09:29.208
Everything okay out here?It'’s just hard.

1:09:31.036 --> 1:09:33.212
Yeah, we'’re fine.

1:09:33.256 --> 1:09:35.693
I'’m sorry, I didn't know
you were coming back.You kidding me?

1:09:35.736 --> 1:09:37.912
I come pick up the kids,
and you'’re gonna have

1:09:37.956 --> 1:09:39.479
a fuck fest in my house
with this guy?

1:09:39.523 --> 1:09:41.438
David, that'’s not
what is going on, okay?

1:09:50.142 --> 1:09:51.404
We all right here?

1:09:51.448 --> 1:09:53.014
Yeah.Yeah, we'’re good.

1:09:53.058 --> 1:09:55.103
You sure? Really
doesn'’t sound like it.

1:09:55.147 --> 1:09:57.845
Just having a conversation
about our kids, man,

1:09:57.889 --> 1:10:00.326
so if you could
just go somewhere,
take a walk or something, man,

1:10:00.370 --> 1:10:02.459
I'’d really appreciate it.

1:10:02.502 --> 1:10:05.244
I think maybe I should be
a part of the conversation,
don'’t you think?

1:10:05.288 --> 1:10:07.333
Are you serious
with this guy?

1:10:07.377 --> 1:10:08.943
Don'’t talk about me
like I'’m not here.

1:10:08.987 --> 1:10:11.250
Then don'’t stand here
and try to have--

1:10:11.294 --> 1:10:13.644
Like you have any value
in this conversation.It'’s fine. We're fine.

1:10:13.687 --> 1:10:15.733
I'’m fine. We're okay.
Just go in the house.

1:10:15.776 --> 1:10:18.953
I'’m talking
about our children,
our family, our marriage.

1:10:18.997 --> 1:10:20.781
So just
get out of here, man.

1:10:20.825 --> 1:10:22.130
I don'’t think so.

1:10:22.174 --> 1:10:23.567
Look, I think
maybe it'’s important

1:10:23.610 --> 1:10:25.221
that I be a part of it
at this point.

1:10:25.264 --> 1:10:27.005
It'’s not important.

1:10:27.048 --> 1:10:29.355
You have zero value
in this conversation.

1:10:29.399 --> 1:10:31.923
Go somewhere--I don'’t appreciate how you're
talking to my girlfriend.

1:10:31.966 --> 1:10:33.838
Your girlfriend?Yes.

1:10:33.881 --> 1:10:35.796
This is my wife. My wife!Okay, okay, okay.

1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:37.102
You know what that means?Hey, hey!

1:10:37.145 --> 1:10:38.408
That is my house
you'’re staying in.

1:10:38.451 --> 1:10:40.279
David, take a breath.Mine!

1:10:40.323 --> 1:10:41.889
You understand that?Derek, let'’s go. Okay?

1:10:41.933 --> 1:10:43.761
You'’re a pathetic piece
of garbage.

1:10:43.804 --> 1:10:45.763
You just prey on women--Okay, take a breath.

1:10:45.806 --> 1:10:48.287
You can'’t find single women
that you can hang out with?

1:10:48.331 --> 1:10:51.072
Derek, just go in the house.You got no game? Huh?

1:10:51.116 --> 1:10:54.075
You gotta come round here,
somebody'’s trying to work
through their marriage issues

1:10:54.119 --> 1:10:56.164
and swoop in on people
that are vulnerable?

1:10:56.208 --> 1:10:57.775
You'’re a fucking leech.

1:10:57.818 --> 1:10:59.690
You'’re a bottom feeder,
you piece of fucking shit.

1:10:59.733 --> 1:11:03.259
Take a breath, David.
Take a breath.

1:11:08.220 --> 1:11:09.830
Derek, come on,
just go in the house.

1:11:09.874 --> 1:11:11.571
I'’m sorry,
I can'’t at this point.

1:11:11.615 --> 1:11:14.270
If you give us a minute,
we could probably
work this out.

1:11:14.313 --> 1:11:16.620
Derek, I promise you,
we don'’t need a minute.

1:11:16.663 --> 1:11:19.318
That'’s the last thing we need.I'’d appreciate it
if you went inside, Niki.

1:11:19.362 --> 1:11:22.278
Dave, please just go.
Go. Okay?

1:11:22.321 --> 1:11:25.193
You feel like a big dick
standing in front of my house?Okay, stop.

1:11:25.237 --> 1:11:26.760
With my wife and kids?
You feel tough?

1:11:26.804 --> 1:11:28.153
David, get in your truck
and go.

1:11:28.196 --> 1:11:29.589
I'’m not leaving
without the kids.

1:11:29.633 --> 1:11:31.287
Derek,
let'’s go in the house.

1:11:31.330 --> 1:11:33.071
So you and your
fucking boyfriend can do--

1:11:33.114 --> 1:11:35.334
David, get in your truck
and leave!

1:11:35.378 --> 1:11:37.945
I'’m not leaving.
I'’m waiting for the kids.

1:11:37.989 --> 1:11:39.730
Call Mrs. Thompson,
tell her to send
the boys down.

1:11:39.773 --> 1:11:41.122
Tell Jess to grab her crap.
Let'’s go.

1:11:41.166 --> 1:11:42.385
You think
that'’s a good idea?

1:11:42.428 --> 1:11:44.125
It'’s happening.

1:11:44.169 --> 1:11:46.127
I don'’t care
if it'’s a good idea
or a bad idea.

1:11:46.171 --> 1:11:49.653
David, I will bring them by
in ten minutes.I'’m not leaving.

1:11:49.696 --> 1:11:52.046
Niki, give us a minute
and everything will be fine.Derek, stop.

1:11:52.090 --> 1:11:53.874
We don'’t need a minute,
Derek.

1:11:53.918 --> 1:11:56.616
I can promise you
the last thing we need
is a fucking minute.

1:11:56.660 --> 1:11:58.357
Go get Jesse
and the boys

1:11:58.401 --> 1:11:59.750
and by the time
you get back,

1:11:59.793 --> 1:12:01.491
we will have this
figured out.

1:12:05.930 --> 1:12:07.323
What do you say, dude?

1:12:07.366 --> 1:12:10.761
I say you
can go fuck yourself.

1:12:14.330 --> 1:12:17.681
All right, wait, guys.
You know what, listen.

1:12:17.724 --> 1:12:21.337
I think this is--
I think this is getting
a little crazy, all right?

1:12:21.380 --> 1:12:24.165
I'’m sorry.
I'’m sorry. I apologize.

1:12:24.209 --> 1:12:25.428
That'’s not me.
You know that.

1:12:25.471 --> 1:12:27.299
David, you too, man.

1:12:28.605 --> 1:12:30.868
I'’m sorry, all right?

1:12:30.911 --> 1:12:33.914
I am new to this dynamic.

1:12:33.958 --> 1:12:36.352
I think that we all are.

1:12:36.395 --> 1:12:38.615
And I realize that
I am forcing myself in,

1:12:38.658 --> 1:12:41.269
but I think that that is
a natural thing to want to do

1:12:41.313 --> 1:12:43.576
with somebody
that I care about
as much as her.

1:12:45.448 --> 1:12:49.887
Hey, my man. Right here.
Look. No disrespect, okay?

1:12:49.930 --> 1:12:52.542
I get that I got
in the middle of something.

1:12:59.026 --> 1:13:01.333
This thing got nothing
to do with you, buddy.

1:13:01.377 --> 1:13:04.771
It'’s much bigger than you.
You need to get
the heck out of here.

1:13:04.815 --> 1:13:06.425
He doesn'’t listen.It doesn'’t matter.

1:13:06.469 --> 1:13:08.514
David and I
need to talk about this,
figure it out.

1:13:08.558 --> 1:13:10.037
If I'’m gonna be here
for any length of time,

1:13:10.081 --> 1:13:12.170
we need to start off
on the right foot.

1:13:12.213 --> 1:13:14.781
I promise,
we don'’t need to start off
on the right foot, okay?

1:13:14.825 --> 1:13:17.436
We'’ll get there, okay?
Just go get Jesse and the boys

1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:19.177
and by the time
you get them back here,

1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:21.614
me and him,
we will work this out,
I promise you that.

1:13:21.658 --> 1:13:23.007
That okay with you,
David?

1:13:23.050 --> 1:13:25.183
Whatever gets the kids
in the truck,

1:13:25.226 --> 1:13:26.663
I'’m so happy with.

1:13:26.706 --> 1:13:28.665
Cool. Okay.
You can call--

1:13:28.708 --> 1:13:30.449
Niki can call,
she can stop by
your dad'’s later,

1:13:30.493 --> 1:13:31.972
and you guys
can work your thing out--

1:13:32.016 --> 1:13:34.366
I don'’t care what she does.
Just get the kids.

1:13:34.410 --> 1:13:36.194
I mean, what is it,
100 yards?

1:13:36.237 --> 1:13:38.152
You can go by later.

1:13:38.196 --> 1:13:40.503
You guys
can work your thing out
after we work our thing out.

1:13:40.546 --> 1:13:42.505
I'’m sorry.Don'’t be sorry. It's okay.

1:13:42.548 --> 1:13:44.332
This sort of thing happens.

1:14:01.524 --> 1:14:03.787
I don'’t know,
what did you hope
to accomplish?

1:14:03.830 --> 1:14:04.918
No, I know.

1:14:13.100 --> 1:14:16.495
I'’m a piece of garbage, huh?
Is that right?

1:14:16.539 --> 1:14:18.671
You are a pile of garbage,
David.

1:14:20.934 --> 1:14:22.588
You don'’t deserve that woman.

1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:37.837
David! David!

1:18:26.484 --> 1:18:28.051
David, stop!

1:18:29.095 --> 1:18:30.575
David!

1:18:42.456 --> 1:18:44.589
Are you okay?
Breathe, David.

1:18:51.552 --> 1:18:53.076
I'’m here.

1:18:54.120 --> 1:18:56.209
I don'’t know what to do.

1:18:56.253 --> 1:18:58.734
I love you.I don'’t know what to do.

1:19:00.170 --> 1:19:02.172
I love you so much.I love you.

1:19:42.865 --> 1:19:45.868
Hey, hey, y'’all go
put those things up. Come on!

1:19:45.911 --> 1:19:47.913
Hey, don'’t touch
unless we bought it.

1:19:47.957 --> 1:19:49.915
With your eyes,
not your hands. Can we buy '’em?

1:19:49.959 --> 1:19:51.221
Hey, babe?No, we can'’t buy 'em.

1:19:51.264 --> 1:19:53.310
Huh?What do you think
of these?

1:19:54.528 --> 1:19:55.965
What'’s wrong with
the ones we got?

1:19:56.008 --> 1:19:58.228
Nothing.
It'’s just, these are smart.

1:19:58.271 --> 1:19:59.707
It'’s an upgrade.

1:20:00.578 --> 1:20:02.362
Smart?

1:20:02.406 --> 1:20:04.277
Can I help you guys
with anything?

1:20:04.321 --> 1:20:06.279
Just looking
at your washers.

1:20:06.323 --> 1:20:08.542
I was telling my husband
everything'’s moving
to smart now.

1:20:08.586 --> 1:20:10.762
That'’s very much true.

1:20:10.806 --> 1:20:12.720
Can you tell him
what that means?

1:20:12.764 --> 1:20:13.939
Yeah, definitely.

1:20:13.983 --> 1:20:15.898
Uh, well,
this specific machine,

1:20:15.941 --> 1:20:18.030
it'’s got a weight sensor
in the washer

1:20:18.074 --> 1:20:19.727
so it can tell
how big the load is,

1:20:19.771 --> 1:20:21.251
and then it can use that
to decide

1:20:21.294 --> 1:20:24.123
how much liquid soap
to put in for the best clean.

1:20:24.167 --> 1:20:25.908
But I thought
that'’s what that little--

1:20:25.951 --> 1:20:27.866
Like, the little cup that
goes at the top of the--

1:20:27.910 --> 1:20:30.129
Oh, yeah, of course.
But this way, you can
just load the soap

1:20:30.173 --> 1:20:33.437
and you don'’t have to
worry about putting
the soap in yourself.

1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:35.352
The coolest thing
about this one, though,

1:20:35.395 --> 1:20:37.484
is that it will
send you a text
when the wash is done,

1:20:37.528 --> 1:20:39.269
so you can stay
on top of your laundry.

1:20:39.312 --> 1:20:40.966
I imagine
with all these kids,

1:20:41.010 --> 1:20:42.794
you'’re always
just juggling that.

1:20:42.838 --> 1:20:45.579
Never ends.Yeah.

1:20:45.623 --> 1:20:47.755
Well, did you have
any more questions
about this one?

1:20:47.799 --> 1:20:49.366
Could it fit him in it?

1:20:49.409 --> 1:20:52.369
Yeah, probably.
This is an extra big,
extra large.

1:20:57.591 --> 1:20:58.897
Get him!

1:22:20.544 --> 1:22:23.895
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

1:22:30.728 --> 1:22:36.299
Painted in a corner

1:22:39.215 --> 1:22:44.307
The ground was wet

1:22:46.787 --> 1:22:53.185
I came to realize

1:22:55.318 --> 1:23:00.801
You'’d already left

1:23:00.845 --> 1:23:03.761
A damn fool

1:23:18.950 --> 1:23:23.999
You cut me loose

1:23:27.132 --> 1:23:33.486
Is what I call this time

1:23:38.013 --> 1:23:41.103
Without you

1:23:41.146 --> 1:23:44.410
A damn fool

1:23:51.374 --> 1:23:55.421
Though all'’s gone wrong

1:24:00.426 --> 1:24:04.300
But it ain'’t lost

1:24:13.091 --> 1:24:17.182
A damn fool
