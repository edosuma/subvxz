00:19.080 --> 00:21.321
Diane Arbus once said,

00:21.330 --> 00:23.912
"A photograph is a secret about a secret.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.376
"The more it tells you the less you know."

00:25.380 --> 00:26.495
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

00:26.500 --> 00:28.411
Spencer! Spencer Reid!

00:29.290 --> 00:33.829
Dude, dude, dude.
Look at you. You look just the same.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.456
Look at you, dude, nothing changed.

00:36.460 --> 00:41.659
Spencer was the only 12-year-old
in our graduating class. Just the same.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.069
Thanks.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.379
This is Special Agent Jason Gideon.
This is Parker Dunley.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.701
We went to high school together,
as you can probably gather.

00:48.710 --> 00:50.246
-Hi. How are you?
-Hey.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.707
-It's a beautiful gallery.
-Oh, thank you, thank you.

00:52.710 --> 00:55.326
Jason's a big contemporary art enthusiast.

00:55.330 --> 00:59.369
Well, we're exhibiting four
up-and-coming artists in this show.

00:59.380 --> 01:00.574
Everything's for sale.

01:00.580 --> 01:04.209
And I could definitely swing
a nice discount for a friend of...

01:06.880 --> 01:10.077
Lila! Hey. Guys, come on.

01:11.330 --> 01:13.821
-Do I look 12-years-old to you

01:18.880 --> 01:21.417
Spencer, you ever meet a real movie star?

01:21.420 --> 01:22.660
Movie star? Please.

01:22.670 --> 01:24.956
She has a supporting role
on a television series

01:24.960 --> 01:26.609
about beach volleyball.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.167
Totally blue-collar.

01:30.750 --> 01:34.242
-I'm Lila.
-Hi, I'm Dr Spencer Reid.

01:34.250 --> 01:38.072
You... I'm Spencer.
You don't have to call me doctor.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.535
I won't.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.990
Excuse me. Hey, you.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.879
I told you no photos in the gallery.
All right? Out!

01:51.830 --> 01:53.206
And who are you?

01:54.330 --> 01:56.116
I'm Jason Gideon. I'm a friend of Reid's.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.917
Have you seen my work?

01:57.920 --> 01:59.456
-No.
-Follow me.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.496
-Thanks.
-No, thanks.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.877
So, you're not from around here, are you?

02:05.880 --> 02:07.279
Me? No, no.

02:07.290 --> 02:09.576
I'm... We're running a training service

02:09.580 --> 02:12.492
about profiling for the
Los Angeles Police Department.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.615
Profiling?

02:13.620 --> 02:16.282
Yeah, I'm with the
Behavioral Analysis Unit of the FBI.

02:16.290 --> 02:17.826
We psychoanalyze crime scenes

02:17.830 --> 02:20.913
in order to gain a better understanding
of the criminal

02:20.920 --> 02:22.319
who might have committed the crime.

02:22.330 --> 02:23.820
Psychoanalyze, huh?

02:25.580 --> 02:28.492
-Are you doing that to me right now No.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.207
I'm not psychoanalyzing you. I'm just...

02:31.210 --> 02:32.416
I'm kidding.

02:36.620 --> 02:39.828
One of my earliest works. Totally boring.

02:40.330 --> 02:43.288
I don't think so. _
I mean, nothing's Just a picture.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.662
If viewed correctly, whatever that means,

02:46.670 --> 02:51.243
one can see world-views, obsessions,
manifestations of the subconscious.

02:52.330 --> 02:55.663
IfI weren't a lesbian,

02:56.250 --> 02:58.286
I'd jump your bones.

02:59.120 --> 03:03.329
I've always had this thing
for middle-aged men.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.997
And you have these piercing,
discerning eyes

03:07.000 --> 03:10.288
which remind me of my father
who was a shrink.

03:10.290 --> 03:15.910
And I'm like, "God, I am so hot!"

03:16.540 --> 03:19.498
Pinky, some guy fromARTnews wants to talk to you.

03:20.830 --> 03:22.206
Don't go away.

03:26.170 --> 03:28.786
-Does it make you feel anything

03:29.880 --> 03:32.110
I can't tell you how to feel.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.827
-Right now I feel pretty good.
-We're leaving.

03:35.790 --> 03:38.327
-We're still looking at the exhibit.
-Now.

03:39.790 --> 03:43.374
-Now. Now.
-So, yeah, I guess we're leaving. So...

03:43.380 --> 03:44.779
-Reid, now.
-It was nice to meet you.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.451
-On the way. Bye.
-You, too, Spencer.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.950
Sorry. Excuse me.

03:57.710 --> 03:58.825
Today, we thought we'd focus

03:58.830 --> 04:00.536
on what is probably the most important
component of profiling...

04:00.540 --> 04:01.700
L.A.P.D. PROFILING CONFERENCE

04:01.710 --> 04:05.111
...or, for that matter, any
investigative technique, victimology.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.283
The word victim
stems from the Latin word, victima,

04:08.290 --> 04:10.246
which means sacrifice.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.788
No, I can't go to the gym.
I'm waiting for my shooting script.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.286
I think it just came.

04:18.290 --> 04:20.827
Yeah, okay.
I'll see you at the gym, babe. Bye.

04:20.830 --> 04:23.617
Victims of violent crimes
are brutallzed by a subject

04:23.620 --> 04:25.167
who takes it upon him or herself

04:25.170 --> 04:28.412
to decide life or death
over a fellow human being.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.115
Hi.

04:31.540 --> 04:33.667
Are you going to give it to me?

04:36.710 --> 04:42.489
There are around 16 million people
in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

04:42.920 --> 04:46.617
Every time a person is killed,
robbed or raped,

04:46.620 --> 04:49.919
the most important question
you will ask yourself is why.

04:49.920 --> 04:54.823
Why did your UnSub
choose this victim at this time?

04:55.330 --> 04:56.820
Was there anything done

04:56.830 --> 05:01.073
which provoked the criminal to act
or was the target available or weak?

05:01.080 --> 05:03.071
A casualty of circumstance?

05:06.290 --> 05:07.370
Natalie?

05:09.620 --> 05:10.666
Natalie.

05:11.080 --> 05:15.870
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No!
Natalie! No! Natalie! Oh, my God!

05:19.040 --> 05:20.166
No!

05:57.290 --> 05:59.667
You know, we really can get ourselves
to the airport.

05:59.670 --> 06:02.878
I didn't invite the FBI here to let them
make their own way around town.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.279
We really appreciate it.

06:04.290 --> 06:06.781
Hey, I can't thank you guys enough
for conducting the seminar.

06:06.790 --> 06:09.953
Well, don't hesitate to call
if there's anything we can help with.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.245
-Thanks.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.990
-You got it?
-Yeah.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.166
Kim, here.

06:22.210 --> 06:23.416
Great.

06:24.830 --> 06:28.288
Yeah, I'll be there as soon
as I drop the FBI agents at LAX.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.666
Everything all right?

06:31.670 --> 06:33.661
Double murder at a Hollywood bungalow.

06:33.670 --> 06:35.035
A celebrity.

06:35.040 --> 06:39.249
A young movie star, Natalie Ryan, and
her fianc apparently shot to death.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.877
It's going to be a major pain in the ass.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.872
Hey, you guys care to take a quick look
before I drive you to the airport?

06:45.880 --> 06:47.871
-It's on the way.
-Absolutely.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.956
No sign of forced entry.

07:08.250 --> 07:09.376
Same weapon.

07:09.380 --> 07:13.168
The girl was shot execution style,
once in the head.

07:13.170 --> 07:15.286
The male three times in the torso.

07:15.290 --> 07:17.372
So, you have two different MOs.

07:17.710 --> 07:19.917
We have an image on
the video surveillance camera.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.957
Looks like a messenger of some kind
wearing a motorcycle helmet.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.279
He's unidentifiable.

07:24.290 --> 07:26.497
There's no sign of a struggle
between the girl and the UnSub

07:26.500 --> 07:27.876
from the door to the couch.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.745
He most likely forced her at gunpoint.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.457
He told her to trust him,
"Do what I say. I won't hurt you."

07:32.460 --> 07:34.030
Mmm-hmm.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.453
He asked her to sit on the couch
and then shot her in the head.

07:37.460 --> 07:39.576
Fianc wasn't expected.
His killing's messier.

07:39.580 --> 07:42.458
It's less controlled. It's less organized.

07:43.540 --> 07:44.666
What do you think?

07:44.670 --> 07:48.162
I've had a couple other cases recently,
past few months.

07:48.170 --> 07:50.570
Same type of weapon, 22 caliber handgun,

07:50.880 --> 07:52.609
both shot in the head.

07:52.620 --> 07:56.204
The first was an established
film producer, Wally Melman,

07:56.210 --> 07:59.873
and the second was Chloe Harris,
another young actress.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.450
Though not as well-known as Natalie here.

08:01.460 --> 08:03.200
Any forensic evidence?

08:03.210 --> 08:05.917
No, and the guys have been going
through this place all morning

08:05.920 --> 08:07.956
and haven't come up with anything.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.281
So, he clearly knows
how to cover his tracks.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.576
-Like a professional hit man?
-Maybe.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.575
Gideon, there are people

08:19.580 --> 08:22.242
actually taking photographs of us
from the next yard.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.786
Yeah, welcome to LA.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.411
Twenty-two's are small,
but efficient.

08:29.420 --> 08:31.490
They bounce around inside a person
like a pinball.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.161
Preferred weapon of the Mafia.

08:33.170 --> 08:35.536
You know, there's no obvious
sexual component to these crimes,

08:35.540 --> 08:37.826
which is usually the case
with serial murders.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.741
So, you are thinking
this is a serial killer?

08:39.750 --> 08:41.240
Well, it's certainly a series of murders.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.957
We don't know enough yet
to call them serial.

08:44.460 --> 08:47.532
Would you consider hanging out in LA
a little while?

08:47.540 --> 08:50.247
Let me lean on your expertise
until we do figure out what we've got?

08:50.250 --> 08:51.786
Yeah, just cancel the flights.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.872
We'll have the rest of our team
out here ASAP.

08:55.420 --> 08:58.617
First two victims,
Wally Melman, Chloe Harris.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.076
Both killed in public places.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.379
Chloe was killed while walking her dog
on the beach in Santa Monica,

09:03.380 --> 09:04.699
which she did every morning,

09:04.710 --> 09:07.531
and Wally was killed
outside of a massage parlor.

09:07.540 --> 09:09.531
In Culver City.
-Which he went to every Tuesday.

09:09.540 --> 09:10.700
Well, if he knows their schedules,

09:10.710 --> 09:12.701
maybe that means
he follows his victims for a while.

09:12.710 --> 09:15.918
And not a single witness.
So we know this UnSub can blend in.

09:15.920 --> 09:19.117
Regardless of the location,
he has the ability to hide in plain sight.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.246
He's meticulous.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.911
The media's calling Natalie Ryan's murder

09:21.920 --> 09:24.912
the biggest celebrity homicide
since Sharon Tate.

09:24.920 --> 09:28.458
-What does that mean for us?
-That everybody will be watching.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.376
This guy is an assassin?

09:32.830 --> 09:36.118
When you look at the victimology,
there's no obvious links.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.246
All the kills are clean,

09:37.250 --> 09:39.741
except in the instance
of the last victim, Jeremy Collins.

09:39.750 --> 09:42.412
There's absolutely no evidence left
at the crime scene.

09:42.420 --> 09:43.569
There's no DNA.

09:43.580 --> 09:46.242
No manifestation of psychosexual release

09:46.250 --> 09:48.741
and there's no detectable signature
of any kind.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.706
Remember, our profiles are formulated

09:50.710 --> 09:54.783
not just by what's present at the scene,
but also what's absent.

09:54.790 --> 09:56.530
From all the evidence that we've gathered,

09:56.540 --> 09:59.782
we believe that you're looking for
a Type Four Assassin.

09:59.790 --> 10:02.281
Type One's are political assassins

10:02.290 --> 10:03.450
like John Wilkes Booth.

10:03.460 --> 10:06.327
Type Two's are egocentrics
looking for simple recognition.

10:06.330 --> 10:07.911
Type Three's are psychopaths,

10:07.920 --> 10:10.115
cold-blooded killers
who leave far messrer scenes

10:10.120 --> 10:11.872
and Type Four, our UnSub,

10:11.880 --> 10:15.418
suffers from a major mental disorder
and is frequently delusional.

10:15.420 --> 10:17.411
_The closer we come _
to figuring out that delu5ion,

10:17.420 --> 10:19.741
the closer we'll get to finding the UnSub.

10:19.750 --> 10:22.036
Well, what's he going to be doing
until we do?

10:22.040 --> 10:23.701
Finding other victims.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.666
Excuse me? Hi.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.669
-Is there a Detective Kim here?
-Right here.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.616
You're heading the investigation
into the Natalie Ryan murder?

10:32.620 --> 10:33.780
Yes.

10:33.790 --> 10:36.668
Um... My... I have a client, she's...

10:38.040 --> 10:39.951
Is there any place we could be private?

10:39.960 --> 10:41.951
We're all working this murder.

10:42.620 --> 10:44.076
Well...

10:44.830 --> 10:48.322
She received a note.
My client did and she freaked out.

10:48.330 --> 10:51.788
-I told her not to worry about it, and...
-Where's the note?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.070
Where is your client?
-She's waiting in the other room.

10:57.330 --> 10:59.241
Reid, let's go.

11:09.420 --> 11:10.614
Lila.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.200
Hi.

11:14.210 --> 11:16.201
How well did you know Natalie Ryan?

11:16.210 --> 11:20.112
We spoke when we saw each other
in public, but we were never friends.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.327
-How about Wally Melman

11:22.330 --> 11:25.208
Wally Melman, he was a producer
who was killed a couple months ago.

11:25.210 --> 11:27.246
The paper said that was a robbery.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.992
-Well, the paper was wrong.
-Did you know him?

11:30.380 --> 11:35.079
Well, we met a few times about
a project, but I didn't get the part.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.662
-They went a different way.
-Which way?

11:37.670 --> 11:39.706
He cast another act...

11:42.290 --> 11:44.781
-Oh, my God.
-What is it?

11:44.790 --> 11:46.496
He cast Natalie Ryan.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.456
"You owe me."

11:49.540 --> 11:52.031
I guess that's one way
to ice out the competition?

11:52.040 --> 11:55.498
Don‘t look at me_. _
I brought her in to the police station.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.615
Have you ever had a sense

11:56.620 --> 11:59.327
that someone is watching you,
following you?

11:59.330 --> 12:00.911
From the moment I get to work,

12:00.920 --> 12:04.321
I have hair and makeup,
and wardrobe people, producers,

12:04.330 --> 12:07.413
writers, my agent, my manager, publicist.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.662
-Not to mention photographers. I...
-It's part of the life.

12:10.670 --> 12:13.070
Anything that seems odd,
out of the ordinary,

12:13.080 --> 12:16.493
happens on a regular basis
or a semi-regular basis?

12:16.920 --> 12:20.117
-What do you mean

12:20.120 --> 12:23.533
-Gifts left anonymously?
-I receive flowers.

12:23.540 --> 12:26.998
On the seventh of each month
they just appear in my trailer.

12:28.250 --> 12:31.458
Never a note. Just a plain glass bowl.

12:32.460 --> 12:36.669
Red anemones. My favorite.

12:36.670 --> 12:38.240
And you don't want to know
who they're from?

12:38.250 --> 12:40.571
Celebrities get anonymous gifts
all the time.

12:40.580 --> 12:42.457
She has fans, you know.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.498
You remember meeting anyone
on the seventh day of the month?

12:47.040 --> 12:49.747
Or in July, the seventh month of the year?

12:50.750 --> 12:52.320
-No.
-Wally Melman was a producer

12:52.330 --> 12:57.779
who considered hiring you,
but didn't and Natalie was a rival.

12:57.790 --> 13:01.248
And Chloe Harris, she looks
a lot like you. Don't you think?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.877
A potential rival.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.495
She was murdered, too.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.828
So, all these people are being killed
because of me?

13:10.830 --> 13:12.821
It's possible.

13:12.830 --> 13:17.449
I'm sorry. I can't. I have to go.

13:25.210 --> 13:26.245
Lila.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.161
Lila. Lila.

13:30.170 --> 13:32.206
What's happening, Spencer?

13:32.210 --> 13:36.032
Well, it's still rather speculative, but
it appears there's a delusional assassin

13:36.040 --> 13:38.577
who's killing people
to help further your career.

13:38.580 --> 13:41.663
It probably started as a stalker.
An erotomanic stalker.

13:41.670 --> 13:45.458
There's a psychopathology of the
evolution of these types of stalkers

13:45.460 --> 13:47.872
and the fact that he's contacting you

13:47.880 --> 13:51.077
indicates that he believes
you owe him something.

13:51.460 --> 13:54.782
This model frequently concludes itself
with one of two possibilities,

13:54.790 --> 13:59.739
either the stalker will kill himself
or he'll kill the object of his affection.

14:06.580 --> 14:09.617
With this UnSub
we're looking at a compound profile.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.576
A Type Four delusional assassin

14:12.580 --> 14:15.822
with an erotomanic fixation
on the actress, Lila Archer.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.610
Erotomanics are a form of stalker

14:19.000 --> 14:21.207
who possess the delusional belief
that another person,

14:21.210 --> 14:23.997
usually of a higher social status,
is in love with them.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.207
In the United States,
at any given time,

14:26.210 --> 14:29.031
there are over 200,0000 people
being stalked.

14:29.040 --> 14:33.613
Our UnSub is having
a fantasy love affair with Lila Archer.

14:33.620 --> 14:36.828
The way John Hinckley did
with Jodie Foster.

14:36.830 --> 14:39.822
Miss Archer was_not aware
of her stalker until yesterday.

14:39.830 --> 14:41.377
He wasn't trying to impress her.

14:41.380 --> 14:45.248
He was more like an unwanted,
very violent guardian angel.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.410
When the stalker feels

14:47.420 --> 14:50.912
as if they've been in some way
betrayed by their love object,

14:51.210 --> 14:53.576
_ this often leads to
Violence against the target.

14:53.580 --> 14:55.457
In the case of John Robert Bardo,

14:55.460 --> 14:57.917
when actress Rebecca Schaeffer took a role

14:57.920 --> 15:00.616
where she had to have a sexual
relationship with another character,

15:00.620 --> 15:03.828
it was enough to force him to snap
and seek her out to kill her.

15:03.830 --> 15:06.537
Though stalkers can be
either male or female,

15:06.540 --> 15:09.168
it's most likely
we're looking for a single male.

15:09.170 --> 15:12.708
A loner in his late 205 to early 40$,

15:12.710 --> 15:18.239
very intelligent with ample time to
follow his victim and study her habits.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.993
As of yet, the UnSub has not directed
any violence towards Miss Archer,

15:22.000 --> 15:26.448
but he has shifted his focus
from those around her to her directly.

15:26.830 --> 15:29.162
This doesn't preclude the fact that anyone

15:29.170 --> 15:33.459
who has the vaguest association
with Miss Archer is a potential target.

15:34.790 --> 15:36.326
We're ready to roll...

15:37.620 --> 15:39.952
-I love you. You're my favorite client.
-No.

15:39.960 --> 15:43.168
-I haven't asked you anything yet.
-I'm not stopping my life.

15:43.170 --> 15:44.876
-You could stay with me.
-No.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.280
_ A hotel?
Just until the police say you're safe.

15:47.290 --> 15:49.110
-Michael.
-You know I worry.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.663
-Goodbye, Michael.
-Okay. Call me, lots. Kisses.

15:56.250 --> 15:59.162
Hello, goodbye. I'm leaving.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.495
Hey, Mags.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.320
He's an odd guy.

16:05.250 --> 16:07.707
Yeah, but who isn't a little odd out here?

16:07.710 --> 16:09.166
Well, that's for sure.

16:09.170 --> 16:11.411
Look, we're ready to rehearse scene 43

16:11.420 --> 16:14.821
and this was taped to your trailer door.

16:15.290 --> 16:16.496
Thanks, hon.

16:34.170 --> 16:37.116
I'm intrigued by this particular
version of the verb, "to be."

16:37.120 --> 16:39.497
-Past participle.
-Steady state of being.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.616
-Preceding adverb.
-"Always."

16:41.620 --> 16:43.747
-In English?
-That is English, actually.

16:43.750 --> 16:46.378
-We're discussing the verb tenses of...
-Reid. Reid.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.325
Our stalker sounds like someone she knows.

16:48.330 --> 16:50.207
Based on the tense of the verb.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.746
Maybe it's time to get her off the street.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.570
You know, there's been
no physical threat to her.

16:53.580 --> 16:57.459
She might be safe just staying put
as opposed to anywhere else.

16:57.460 --> 16:59.610
I'm standing right here, guys.

16:59.620 --> 17:02.828
If we did remove you, we'd have to
take you to a non-disclosed location.

17:02.830 --> 17:04.957
I'm sure your stalker knows
where you live.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.825
I'm not having the whole show close down.

17:06.830 --> 17:09.037
I only have one more scene to shoot.

17:09.790 --> 17:13.783
Look, last night I decided I wasn't
going to be afraid of this lunatic.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.826
Am I safe here?

17:15.830 --> 17:19.664
Well, the set's cleared of everyone
except essential personnel

17:19.670 --> 17:21.410
and we have increased security
at the gate.

17:23.500 --> 17:27.789
-Lila, they're ready for you.
-I'm staying at work, gentlemen.

17:34.500 --> 17:37.116
-Well, she's one tough girl.
-Yeah.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.490
I didn't want to say anything
in front of her,

17:39.500 --> 17:41.115
but his anger
about her going to the police

17:41.120 --> 17:42.951
suggests he might alter his agenda.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.700
That's typical for a stalker.

17:44.710 --> 17:46.701
You know,
she didn't go alone to the police.

17:46.710 --> 17:47.870
Her manager took her.

17:47.880 --> 17:50.451
You and Reid stay here.
Keep an eye on her.

17:50.790 --> 17:51.950
I'll hang back, too.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.667
-Where are you going?
-To talk to her manager.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.872
Sorry if I was insensitive last night.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.872
-You were only doing your job, right?
-Yeah.

18:15.170 --> 18:17.320
Then there's no need to apologize.

18:23.250 --> 18:24.706
You don't mind sharing with me, do you?

18:25.920 --> 18:27.069
No.

18:40.540 --> 18:42.110
You don't mind sharing with me, do you?

18:42.120 --> 18:44.281
-Shut up.
-Go get 'em, lover.

18:48.750 --> 18:51.571
Hello

18:53.960 --> 18:54.995
Michael?

19:00.790 --> 19:02.109
Up until now every victim was a person

19:02.120 --> 19:04.247
who could be perceived
as a threat to Miss Archer.

19:04.250 --> 19:07.879
-Yeah, but Michael was a friend.
-He was a threat to the stalker.

19:13.540 --> 19:15.326
Get Lila to a safe house.

19:15.330 --> 19:18.163
She's still on set working.
Did you meet up with her manager?

19:18.170 --> 19:21.537
Reid, take her home.
Have her pack some things.

19:21.540 --> 19:25.078
-What's going on?
-We were too late.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.036
-She's going to be devastated.-I know.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.497
JJ's keeping it out of the press for now.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.115
Let's not tell her yet.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.951
-Not tell her?-No, not yet.

19:36.380 --> 19:40.703
We need her to cooperate with us,
in order to protect her.

19:41.330 --> 19:43.036
I'll talk to you later.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.166
We're going to take her off the street?

19:49.170 --> 19:50.990
We're going to completely deny him access.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.321
Won't even give him a glimpse of her.

19:53.620 --> 19:55.918
Well, hopefully that'll bring him out
of the woodwork.

19:55.920 --> 19:56.989
Hopefully.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.740
Unit available for...

20:07.790 --> 20:09.371
-Let's go.
-All right.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.821
Yeah. No, we're pulling up right now.

20:13.460 --> 20:15.530
Uh-huh. There's a marked car out front.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.075
Yeah.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.917
Got it. I'll check it out.

20:22.790 --> 20:23.950
Is everything okay?

20:23.960 --> 20:26.497
I just need to run through some
security measures with you.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.615
All right.

20:30.080 --> 20:33.038
Gideon, you better take a look at these.

20:39.460 --> 20:41.576
-Morgan, it's Elle.
-Yeah?

20:41.580 --> 20:44.242
We just found a manila envelope
on Michael Ryer's desk.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.457
-It's full of photos.-Okay.

20:46.460 --> 20:49.202
Well, they're candid shots
of Lila Archer nude.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.666
I'm guessing
he was probably paying someone off

20:51.670 --> 20:53.035
to keep them out of the press.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.450
Do we know who?

20:54.460 --> 20:56.997
The name on the envelope was Joe Martinez.

20:57.540 --> 20:58.871
Paparazzo?

20:58.880 --> 21:01.667
-You know him?
-Yeah, I deal with him a lot.

21:01.670 --> 21:03.285
Elle, we're on it.

21:05.960 --> 21:11.455
-Wow. I like your house.
-I rent it.

21:12.620 --> 21:15.874
Nice. You should also probably change
all your phone numbers.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.074
I'm unlisted.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.662
Anytime you call an 800 number
or an 888 number

21:19.670 --> 21:22.992
your phone number's put into a data
bank that's then sold to telemarketers.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.240
If someone gets your cell phone number,

21:24.250 --> 21:27.117
they can go online
and research all your records.

21:30.040 --> 21:33.282
Hanging out with you
could be really depressing.

21:34.290 --> 21:35.575
You should also probably carry

21:35.580 --> 21:37.491
a piece of paper and a pen with you
where ever you go

21:37.500 --> 21:41.243
in case you see any suspicious
license plates that often reappear.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.700
Photographic collage.

21:43.710 --> 21:46.281
I like it because it's like life,
you know?

21:46.290 --> 21:48.451
You know, like obscure, difficult.

21:50.620 --> 21:54.579
You should also get a dog.
Like a guard dog of some sort.

21:54.580 --> 21:57.242
Allergic. Earl Grey or chamomile?

21:57.670 --> 21:59.956
-What -Well, do you want some tea?

22:00.830 --> 22:02.457
Yes, yes, sure.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.035
FBI!

22:07.880 --> 22:09.074
Martinez?

22:12.290 --> 22:13.700
It's clear.

22:24.830 --> 22:28.209
See? This guy's a real scumbag.

22:28.790 --> 22:30.280
You got that right.

22:40.790 --> 22:43.247
-What's this?
-It's a call sheet.

22:43.250 --> 22:45.571
It's the shooting schedule
for a film or television show.

22:45.580 --> 22:47.491
-That's Lila's show.
-Yeah.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.116
-He's not supposed to have that, is he?
-No.

23:01.210 --> 23:04.577
-Hey. Look at that.
-That's Reid.

23:05.210 --> 23:07.201
There's a whole bunch of them.

23:09.580 --> 23:10.990
He a target now?

23:11.540 --> 23:13.576
Not ifI can help it. Let's go.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.036
Reid, it's Morgan. Listen to me.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.416
You got to watch your back over there.

23:19.420 --> 23:21.206
We just found a bunch
of close-up photos of you

23:21.210 --> 23:23.531
at this guy Joseph Martinez's studio.

23:23.540 --> 23:24.996
It looks like he could be the UnSub.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.786
He had a ton of photos of Lila and Natalie

23:26.790 --> 23:28.667
plus a call sheet for Lila's show.

23:28.670 --> 23:29.819
We're on our way right now,

23:29.830 --> 23:31.707
but I need you to be real careful
until we get there, all right?

23:31.710 --> 23:32.950
All right.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.951
-You hit -Yeah. It's just my shoulder.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.030
All right. I'm calling for help.

23:48.790 --> 23:52.169
Officer down. We need an ambulance
at La Brea and Wilshire.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.457
-How we doing?
-He'll make it.

24:03.460 --> 24:05.917
Caught one in the shoulder
and shattered his collarbone.

24:05.920 --> 24:07.535
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.451
No sign of this Martinez,
the photographer?

24:09.460 --> 24:10.666
No.

24:10.670 --> 24:12.615
Whoever took a shot at you
followed you from the set.

24:12.620 --> 24:14.247
Martinez has a bunch of paperwork
in the studio

24:14.250 --> 24:15.376
that says where Lila's
going to be every day.

24:16.790 --> 24:17.825
Gideon.

24:19.170 --> 24:20.819
That's what I thought. Thanks.

24:20.830 --> 24:22.991
Garcia's gone through every article
written about Lila.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.072
She never says anything about red anemones
being her favorite flower.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.957
Well, we're looking for someone
pretty close to her.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.996
-This list gets shorter every day.
-He's circling in.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.740
We need to get to her house.

24:31.750 --> 24:34.913
I'll make sure the press
doesn't get out of hand with this mess.

24:46.620 --> 24:48.030
Feel anything yet?

24:48.040 --> 24:51.248
There is something definitely appealing
about this one.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.285
That's a start.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.457
-What are you doing?
-Going for a swim.

25:01.460 --> 25:03.075
What? No, Lila.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.076
Whoo! Ah...

25:12.080 --> 25:15.413
-Lila, you cannot do this.
-Five minutes.

25:16.540 --> 25:19.668
-Go get a suit in the house.
-What? No, I'm not going to grab a suit.

25:19.670 --> 25:21.456
-Are you kidding me? No.
-Don't... Join me.

25:21.460 --> 25:24.202
-No, I'm not going to join you.
-Why not?

25:24.210 --> 25:27.998
You're being pursued by a psychotic
killer who shoots people in the head.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.037
I am not going to stop living my life.
I'm just not.

25:32.540 --> 25:35.748
Lila, I'm begging of you.
Will you please get out of the pool?

25:35.750 --> 25:37.286
Really, Spencer, you should live a little.

25:37.290 --> 25:41.909
Live a little? I've known you 48 hours,
I feel like I've already aged 10 years.

25:41.920 --> 25:44.912
-I can't be that bad.
-Yes. No, you are that bad.

25:53.500 --> 25:56.207
Fine, can you help me out at least?

26:07.790 --> 26:10.076
Yes, very funny. Laugh it up, Lila.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.662
Hilarious. My gun's wet.
That's just great.

26:20.710 --> 26:23.702
-My clothes.
-You should have worn the suit.

26:30.620 --> 26:33.111
-This is completely inappropriate.
-This?

26:33.750 --> 26:35.911
-What's this?
-This isn't...

26:46.120 --> 26:49.499
No, there's this thing
called transference.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.786
-You don't like me.
-What?

26:51.790 --> 26:53.667
-You don't like me.
-No, are you... Yeah, I do.

26:53.670 --> 26:55.206
-Because I like you.
-I like you, too.

26:55.210 --> 26:57.166
It's just I'm a federal agent.

26:57.170 --> 26:59.491
You know? And I'm supposed to protect you.

26:59.500 --> 27:00.990
Then keep me close.

27:01.380 --> 27:05.612
I'm just... I'm a little bit worried,
you know? We're in a pool.

27:05.620 --> 27:09.033
And it's... We're pretty much exposed.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.288
We have cops.
We have cops posted out front.

27:15.170 --> 27:16.956
There are coyotes out back.

27:19.040 --> 27:21.702
And then you have just you and me.

27:26.290 --> 27:27.325
I...

27:28.500 --> 27:29.876
Stop. I'm sorry.

27:29.880 --> 27:34.078
-I have to tell you something.
-What?

27:34.710 --> 27:36.029
I didn't want to tell you this before

27:36.040 --> 27:37.371
because I was a little bit worried...

27:37.380 --> 27:40.702
I didn't know how to say it,
but I can't not tell you.

27:41.210 --> 27:44.668
-What is it?
-Your manager, Michael.

27:45.920 --> 27:46.955
What?

27:49.210 --> 27:54.659
Gideon went to check on him,
but he got there too late.

28:06.420 --> 28:07.455
Lila.

28:12.540 --> 28:13.916
How could you...

28:15.880 --> 28:19.168
-How could you not tell me?
-I was afraid you'd be upset.

28:21.170 --> 28:25.243
You knew what you knew, and...

28:25.250 --> 28:28.413
-How could you not...
-I'm so sorry.

28:33.080 --> 28:35.571
Don't! Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

28:41.670 --> 28:43.206
Give me a reason.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.879
-Well, we found him in the bushes.
-I told her she should cut those.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.200
I fell in.

28:57.210 --> 28:59.496
Yeah and I'm sure
there's plenty of photos of it.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.377
Stop shoving me, man.

29:02.330 --> 29:03.615
You're a suspect in the murder

29:03.620 --> 29:05.497
of Wally Melman, Natalie Ryan,
and Jeremy Collins.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.991
-Murder Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
-Just shut up with the "whoa".

29:08.000 --> 29:09.956
We know for a fact
that you have hundreds of photographs

29:09.960 --> 29:12.667
of Lila Archer and Natalie Ryan
on the walls of your studio.

29:12.670 --> 29:14.456
You have Miss Archer's daily schedule
on your desk.

29:14.460 --> 29:16.610
-You've been stalking her.
-Look, guy, look, hold up.

29:16.620 --> 29:18.372
Every paparazzi's a celebrity stalker.

29:18.380 --> 29:19.950
If you don't stalk them,
you don't get the shot,

29:19.960 --> 29:22.167
and if you don't make the shot,
you don't sell no pictures.

29:22.170 --> 29:25.742
-Well, this one is going to cost you.
-Well, no! That's just wrong.

29:25.750 --> 29:27.206
Tell it to your lavwer.

29:27.210 --> 29:28.780
-I'm still being locked up?
-That's right.

29:28.790 --> 29:31.532
At the very least you're trespassing.
Let's go.

29:33.290 --> 29:34.575
You're welcome.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.109
Lila?

29:53.880 --> 29:55.245
Are you still...

29:57.250 --> 29:58.820
Are you okay?

29:58.830 --> 30:00.616
Michael was like family.

30:02.710 --> 30:03.950
I'm so sorry.

30:05.670 --> 30:08.787
It's just so hard
to trust people out here.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.162
You don't know who to believe.

30:13.540 --> 30:17.874
Everybody wants something from you.
That's why I thought you were different.

30:20.170 --> 30:23.879
-I know I should have told you.
-I told him not to.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.030
He was only following my orders.

30:36.290 --> 30:40.078
You know the last time I was able to fully

30:41.080 --> 30:43.207
trust someone was at Juilliard?

30:45.500 --> 30:47.912
Before I was a somebody.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.876
Juilliard?

30:55.420 --> 30:58.036
And didn't you say
you used to live on Houston Street?

30:58.040 --> 30:59.075
What?

31:00.210 --> 31:02.952
You were a waitress, you lived on Houston?

31:03.880 --> 31:05.108
Yeah.

31:09.710 --> 31:13.202
-I need to take this thing apart.
-What?

31:13.210 --> 31:17.032
I'll put it back.
I think I see images of you.

31:17.830 --> 31:18.956
Guys!

31:28.170 --> 31:30.570
Lila, it looks like
someone's been stalking you for years.

31:30.580 --> 31:32.320
Yeah, this tells your whole life story.

31:32.330 --> 31:35.914
-Movie premieres, theater playbills.
-Everything since college.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.827
That's our country house. Right here.

31:40.540 --> 31:42.496
-Who gave you this collage?
-He did.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.741
This guy

31:44.750 --> 31:48.038
That's the guy I went
to high school with, Parker Dunley.

31:50.750 --> 31:54.572
Garcia. Parker Dunley.
E-mail me a sheet on him, all right?

32:08.710 --> 32:09.916
Oh.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.491
-Look who's here.
-Where's Parker?

32:12.500 --> 32:14.536
I don't even get a hello?

32:15.380 --> 32:16.574
Where is he?

32:16.830 --> 32:19.879
I guess it follows
since I never got a goodbye.

32:20.540 --> 32:21.780
Parker!

32:23.460 --> 32:25.496
-Friend of yours?
-No.

32:27.420 --> 32:31.072
How can I help...
Hey, Spencer's friend, right?

32:31.540 --> 32:32.575
Yes.

32:33.420 --> 32:36.537
-Did you give Lila Archer a collage

32:36.540 --> 32:38.872
There's a photographic collage
above Lila Archer's sofa.

32:38.880 --> 32:41.781
-She says you gave it to her.
-So?

32:41.790 --> 32:43.917
So it has your face hidden all over it.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.115
I didn't make the damned thing.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.992
So you just happened
to give her a work of art

32:50.000 --> 32:52.070
contains most of her life in it?

32:52.620 --> 32:56.033
I... No, no.

32:56.670 --> 33:01.289
If there's something you aren't saying,
now would be a real good time to say it.

33:01.290 --> 33:02.496
All right.

33:04.790 --> 33:06.951
-All right, I lied.
-What about?

33:08.420 --> 33:12.572
I just wanted her to like me.
I met her here. She was a fan of art.

33:12.580 --> 33:15.378
I figured if there was hip,
young stars coming into the gallery,

33:15.380 --> 33:17.075
it would help business.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.206
What was the lie?

33:18.210 --> 33:20.701
Someone gave me the piece to give to her,

33:21.000 --> 33:22.160
but I told her it was from me.

33:22.170 --> 33:24.115
I said I found it
and I thought she'd love it.

33:24.120 --> 33:26.702
-And who gave it to you?
-Her name's Maggie Lowe.

33:26.710 --> 33:29.247
She... She works on Lila's show.

33:30.210 --> 33:31.780
She said she went to college with Lila.

33:31.790 --> 33:36.489
She's like a PA or AD or some acronym.

33:36.500 --> 33:39.162
She wanted me to make sure
Lila got the collage,

33:39.170 --> 33:41.240
but she didn't want Lila to know
that she gave it to her.

33:41.250 --> 33:44.208
She said to say
that it was from a secret admirer,

33:45.880 --> 33:48.166
but I told her it was from me, so...

33:48.170 --> 33:52.914
We have a name. Maggie Lowe.
She's the UnSub. She's on Lila's show.

33:53.670 --> 33:55.069
We're on our way.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.247
Lila, do you know someone
named Maggie Lowe?

33:58.250 --> 34:02.414
Mags? Yeah, of course I know her.
I've known her for years.

34:02.830 --> 34:04.741
I got her a job on my show.

34:07.580 --> 34:08.615
What?

34:08.880 --> 34:09.995
That's her calling right now.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.911
-Is she calling from a cell phone?
-Yeah.

34:11.920 --> 34:15.321
-Lila, we think Maggie's the UnSub.
-The what?

34:15.330 --> 34:17.878
-The stalker.
-No way.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.952
-Answer the phone.
-That's crazy.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.496
Answer the phone. Act completely natural.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.706
The longer we keep her on the line,

34:23.710 --> 34:25.871
the more likely
we'll be able to trace the call.

34:25.880 --> 34:26.915
Trust me.

34:30.420 --> 34:31.569
Hello?

34:32.500 --> 34:35.822
Hello, Maggie

34:37.080 --> 34:38.286
What's wrong?

34:38.750 --> 34:42.117
Oracle of Quantico,
speak if you deign to hear truth.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.826
Garcia, I need an emergency trace

34:43.830 --> 34:46.287
on a cell phone call
to Lila Archer's cell phone.

34:46.290 --> 34:47.666
Sure. Go ahead.

34:47.670 --> 34:50.377
555-0129.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.371
Okay. Keep her talking. Keep her talking.

34:52.380 --> 34:53.495
Maggie?

34:54.380 --> 34:57.281
I am so tired, Lila.

34:57.290 --> 34:59.030
Ti red?-Yeah.

35:00.920 --> 35:05.118
There's been so much upset
in the world really.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.997
I think it's just so tragic.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.376
All of it.

35:09.960 --> 35:12.952
I miss you. Ijust do.

35:14.170 --> 35:17.571
Mags, I saw you today.

35:17.580 --> 35:20.538
It's never going to be the same as it was.

35:21.080 --> 35:23.492
It's just never going to be the same.

35:28.170 --> 35:32.288
I'm talking about that time in college!

35:32.290 --> 35:34.702
When the heat in your apartment was off

35:34.710 --> 35:36.826
and the two of us stayed in my dorm room.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.320
Don't you remember?

35:40.750 --> 35:44.709
You were playing Ophelia on the mainstage.

35:47.170 --> 35:51.493
-I remember.
-That was the happiest time of my life.

35:52.830 --> 35:55.822
Maggie, sweetheart,

35:57.540 --> 35:59.576
that was only for a weekend.

35:59.580 --> 36:01.457
The happiest time.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.992
And you don't know
anything about me at all.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.452
And I did everything for you.

36:12.670 --> 36:16.071
Reid, is Lila's address 6028 Pike Street?

36:16.080 --> 36:17.240
Yeah.

36:18.120 --> 36:19.701
She's calling from inside the house.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.280
I'll give you some backup.

36:23.710 --> 36:26.702
Lila.
MAGGIE: You! You! You!

36:27.620 --> 36:30.783
-How'd she get in the house?
-She has keys.

37:10.330 --> 37:12.821
Why'd you have to bring these people here?

37:12.830 --> 37:14.661
-Put down the gun.
-Maggie.

37:15.620 --> 37:18.327
Don't call me Maggie! You don't know me!

37:18.330 --> 37:22.448
Come on, Lila, let's go.
We got to go, baby. Come on.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.746
Maggie, don't hurt her.

37:25.460 --> 37:28.577
-You don't need to hurt her.
-You don't know anything.

37:28.960 --> 37:32.111
I would never do anything to hurt you.

37:32.830 --> 37:36.072
No, I created you.

37:37.290 --> 37:38.666
No, you didn't!

37:40.830 --> 37:43.492
Yes, I did.

37:44.080 --> 37:47.038
I know I did!

37:47.790 --> 37:48.825
God!

37:49.290 --> 37:53.533
You stupid, ungrateful...

37:53.880 --> 37:58.954
God, I can't believe that I loved you.

37:58.960 --> 38:02.612
Maggie, she... She loves me now.

38:05.880 --> 38:06.915
What?

38:07.920 --> 38:09.376
She told me so.

38:09.380 --> 38:11.917
We were in the pool. She kissed me.

38:12.670 --> 38:14.706
-Now she loves me. Okay?
-No.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.571
-Tell her we kissed in the pool.
-No!

38:24.920 --> 38:26.660
-Yes, we kissed.
-See?

38:35.380 --> 38:36.608
-Don't move!
-Please!

38:36.620 --> 38:39.032
-Please! Kill me.
-It's okay. It's over.

38:39.620 --> 38:41.110
Come on, shoot me! Please!

38:41.120 --> 38:44.499
I'd be so much happier, please! Please!

38:46.500 --> 38:47.535
Come on.

38:49.750 --> 38:51.661
We're going to get you help.

38:54.330 --> 38:56.161
It's going to be all right.

39:05.170 --> 39:07.707
You heard the lady.
Back up! Let's go!

39:07.710 --> 39:10.611
Darling, E Scape wants to do
a segment on you this evening

39:10.620 --> 39:12.497
on the stalking event. I told them yes.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.707
-Why'd you do that?
-It's okay. It's going to be fine.

39:14.710 --> 39:16.666
Their hair and makeup people
are coming in 10 minutes.

39:16.670 --> 39:18.911
There's also talk about 60 Minutes.

39:19.960 --> 39:22.576
This kind of publicity
makes me really uncomfortable.

39:22.580 --> 39:23.740
Don't be ridiculous!

39:23.750 --> 39:25.991
We're talking about performing
a public service. All right?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.207
Stalking is a major problem
in this country. It's good. It's good.

39:29.380 --> 39:30.870
I got to take this.

39:33.500 --> 39:36.116
Looks like you're going to be pretty busy.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.748
I wish things had been,

39:40.120 --> 39:43.169
you know, more normal when we had met.

39:43.170 --> 39:45.957
Lila, believe me when I say this,

39:45.960 --> 39:48.872
I have never known a normal day
in my entire life.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.747
Hey, Reid. Come on, we got to move.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.200
Got you.

39:53.210 --> 39:57.783
Well, if I'm ever in Washington
and I were to give you a call,

39:57.790 --> 39:58.996
would that be okay?

39:59.000 --> 40:00.956
Yeah, I'd like that a lot.

40:04.750 --> 40:06.706
-I don't want to intrude, but...
-No, not at all.

40:06.710 --> 40:08.109
Reid, sorry. We're waiting.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.371
I'm on it.

40:09.380 --> 40:10.608
Lila, we got to go.

40:10.620 --> 40:13.168
And, you know, I don't know
when you're going to be back here.

40:13.170 --> 40:15.877
_You know next_time
you're in Los Angeles if you'll be...

40:15.880 --> 40:17.108
If you'll have the time...

40:23.830 --> 40:25.457
Lila, we've got to go.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.996
Can you look this way?
This way.

40:41.210 --> 40:44.919
Bernard Shaw once said,
"An American has no sense of privacy.

40:44.920 --> 40:48.742
"He does not know what it means.
There is no such thing in the country."

40:55.920 --> 40:58.571
-Night, Hollywood.
-Come on, man.

40:59.460 --> 41:00.609
You know, Reid,

41:00.620 --> 41:01.917
you're lucky they didn't get a shot of you

41:01.920 --> 41:03.490
next to the pool trying to dry your gun.

41:03.500 --> 41:05.286
You looked like a wet rat.

41:06.250 --> 41:08.741
Hey, I was playing.

41:10.710 --> 41:14.669
Did you know that she... We...

41:15.620 --> 41:17.372
I kissed her in the pool?

41:18.080 --> 41:22.198
It's _so weird. It doesn't even feel like
it really happened, you know?

41:22.210 --> 41:24.371
Well, sure,
she's a beautiful young actress.

41:24.380 --> 41:25.529
Yeah. Yeah, you know,

41:25.540 --> 41:27.952
I kept explaining to her
about transference and the fact that,

41:27.960 --> 41:31.612
you know, she probably only liked me
because I was there to protect her...

41:31.620 --> 41:34.248
Reid. You were her hero.

41:36.210 --> 41:37.529
I wanted to think that.

41:37.540 --> 41:39.872
No, no, no,
don't go selling yourself short, kid.

41:39.880 --> 41:43.077
You took down an armed subject
without firing a shot.

41:43.080 --> 41:46.413
You saved her life.
It's pretty much a hero in my book.

41:49.210 --> 41:52.702
Let me ask you this, have you ever
crossed professional boundaries

41:52.710 --> 41:56.168
with a victim of a case
you were working on?

41:58.960 --> 42:02.111
-No.
-It's pretty bad, right?

42:02.120 --> 42:06.284
There's some things you can't control
even with that big old brain of yours.

42:06.290 --> 42:07.996
No harm, no foul.

42:09.500 --> 42:11.877
-Let it go.
-Hey, Morgan.

42:13.420 --> 42:15.456
Has there ever been a girl

42:15.460 --> 42:18.702
that you wanted to be with for
more than, you know, just one night?

42:20.420 --> 42:21.739
Excuse me?

42:21.750 --> 42:25.163
I've never seen you
with the same girl twice.

42:25.170 --> 42:27.491
-What, are you calling me a dog?
-No, no, no, not at all.

42:27.500 --> 42:32.949
I'm just trying to figure out if this
feeling I have is ever going to go away?

42:33.580 --> 42:36.378
Reid, what we do for a living,
it takes up all our time,

42:36.380 --> 42:39.076
and a relationship's hard enough
even in the same city.

42:39.080 --> 42:42.243
So, I mean,
you're saying it's probably wise

42:42.250 --> 42:44.411
that I don't call her, right?

42:45.380 --> 42:47.450
I can't answer that one for you.

42:48.380 --> 42:50.245
Here, I'll tell you what I do know.

42:50.250 --> 42:53.242
You don't need to come up
with that answer tonight.

42:55.330 --> 42:56.615
I'm out.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.912
-Have a good weekend.
-Yeah, you too, Romeo.
