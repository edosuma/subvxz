00:35.691 --> 00:39.008
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mayor.

00:39.010 --> 00:41.448
- Good morning, Corrado.
- A coffee?

00:41.450 --> 00:43.208
Good morning, Mayor.

00:43.210 --> 00:47.128
Mayor, about my nephew's situation...

00:47.130 --> 00:50.887
We made a call,
the time it takes and we'll fix it.

00:50.889 --> 00:52.527
Thanks for everything.

00:52.529 --> 00:54.569
- You're welcome, Mayor.
- Thank you, Corrado.

00:57.529 --> 00:59.409
Have a nice day.

01:22.927 --> 01:25.645
- What's going on?
- Dad wants to talk to you.

01:25.647 --> 01:27.246
- Now?
- Yes.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.484
Where are you going?

01:30.486 --> 01:33.166
Get in my car,
I'll bring you back later.

02:04.763 --> 02:06.841
<i>Sunshine is predicted for this week,</i>

02:06.843 --> 02:11.643
<i>with spikes in humidity
and moderate winds.</i>

02:33.361 --> 02:35.199
What's going on, Gerlando?

02:35.201 --> 02:38.239
I have a council meeting this morning,
is this any way to behave?

02:38.241 --> 02:41.398
You're making me look like shit
with the clinic.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.718
No one's fault but your own.

02:43.720 --> 02:46.758
You bit off more than you can chew
and you want to rush things.

02:46.760 --> 02:50.278
I bought you two thousand votes.

02:50.280 --> 02:54.917
The citizens went to vote,
I paid them 50 euros each.

02:54.919 --> 02:57.677
So I paid for nothing?

02:57.679 --> 03:00.957
You're right,
but we're in a democracy.

03:00.959 --> 03:03.436
There are laws, the prefect,

03:03.438 --> 03:06.796
newspapers, the opposition,
public opinion.

03:06.798 --> 03:08.996
Someone always wants
to show who's in charge.

03:08.998 --> 03:12.958
You were a nobody and now
for everyone you're "the mayor".

03:14.558 --> 03:16.835
You know why we got you elected?

03:16.837 --> 03:20.795
Because now
we enter your offices as we please,

03:20.797 --> 03:22.437
like bosses.

03:23.637 --> 03:28.394
If things aren't like that anymore,
we'll have to change, my dear Antonio.

03:28.396 --> 03:31.236
It means we backed
the wrong person.

03:37.516 --> 03:40.713
You think you can do
what you want, don't you?

03:40.715 --> 03:44.593
But have you thought this through?
People like me in this town.

03:44.595 --> 03:46.553
Good for you!

03:46.555 --> 03:49.953
- Do you want to do things or not?
- I do what I can.

03:49.955 --> 03:52.554
You have my word. But it's not easy.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.194
Go. May the Holy Virgin be with you.

04:03.873 --> 04:06.233
- Goodbye, Gerlando.
- Take care.

04:26.232 --> 04:28.389
Take him to the quarry.

04:28.391 --> 04:31.429
Saro's there, too.

04:31.431 --> 04:33.311
And fix him up good.

04:38.191 --> 04:42.390
My beauty! Have I fed you?

04:44.550 --> 04:47.188
And have you got water?

04:47.190 --> 04:49.590
You're all dirty,
we gotta clean up here.

07:11.618 --> 07:13.738
<i>Felice!</i>

07:16.297 --> 07:18.497
<i>Felice, come here a moment.</i>

07:20.057 --> 07:26.177
<i>I got a nice present for you. Come.</i>

07:28.176 --> 07:31.454
<i>Felice, I wanted to introduce you
to Gennaro Savastano.</i>

07:31.456 --> 07:34.334
- <i>Kill him!</i>
- <i>What the fuck you talking about?</i>

07:34.336 --> 07:36.374
<i>Shut up, it won't take long.</i>

07:36.376 --> 07:40.095
<i>I didn't do anything, guys!</i>

07:41.975 --> 07:43.415
<i>Shoot!</i>

07:44.855 --> 07:46.535
<i>Go!</i>

07:49.495 --> 07:51.974
<i>Go, Gennaro!</i>

07:54.854 --> 07:57.652
<i>You gotta finish now, Gennaro!</i>

07:57.654 --> 07:59.174
<i>And go!</i>

09:09.368 --> 09:11.008
What happened?

09:16.047 --> 09:17.767
Ciro's dead.

09:24.887 --> 09:26.966
He died to protect me...

09:28.766 --> 09:30.406
Us.

09:34.686 --> 09:36.606
Now we're alone.

09:42.645 --> 09:45.165
We've always been alone, Gennaro.

09:46.245 --> 09:48.045
Always.

09:49.685 --> 09:55.004
But you're Gennaro Savastano,
don't you ever forget that.

10:05.843 --> 10:08.321
Guys, what the fuck happened?

10:08.323 --> 10:11.601
We've fucking had it
with being billiard balls.

10:11.603 --> 10:14.600
From now on, we're like Switzerland.

10:14.602 --> 10:17.242
Nice place, Switzerland, huh?

10:18.562 --> 10:20.282
But it's 800km from Naples.

10:29.721 --> 10:33.719
If you make us fight a war
we don't want to,

10:33.721 --> 10:37.081
you'll have a problem in Central Naples.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.678
But if we leave with a handshake,

10:45.680 --> 10:48.640
no one will come and give you shit
in your neighborhood.

10:50.239 --> 10:53.317
You have one enemy less.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.959
Think about it.

11:32.236 --> 11:34.036
Good morning.

11:44.115 --> 11:46.795
As you all know, the Wizard's dead.

11:50.274 --> 11:53.274
Now the SanitÃ  and Maddalena areas
are under our control.

11:54.834 --> 11:57.634
For those who want to work with us,
our door is always open.

11:59.314 --> 12:03.751
As far as the money is concerned,
there's 20% more for everyone.

12:03.753 --> 12:05.713
But you gotta earn it.

12:08.273 --> 12:11.873
We gotta wipe Gennaro Savastano
from the face of the earth.

13:42.465 --> 13:43.905
Stop.

14:04.623 --> 14:08.383
I'd like to keep buying the stuff
from you, at the same price.

14:11.023 --> 14:13.981
Between you and me it's just business.

14:13.983 --> 14:16.302
I think alliances are bullshit.

14:17.582 --> 14:21.540
You hold one hand out
and hide a gun with the other.

14:21.542 --> 14:23.502
We're out.

14:31.661 --> 14:33.101
Is it here?

14:39.100 --> 14:40.580
It's here.

15:14.937 --> 15:17.297
I'm cool with everything you said.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.697
But I swear in front of my brother...

15:27.216 --> 15:31.096
I'll never forget
what you made me do on that boat.

15:40.375 --> 15:44.295
When you kill someone you care about,
you kill yourself.

15:47.495 --> 15:49.775
I'm not looking for your forgiveness...

15:52.774 --> 15:54.614
...but mine.

16:15.332 --> 16:19.370
- What do you want?
- Easy, old man. Where's the cage?

16:19.372 --> 16:21.730
It's back here, but don't kill me.

16:21.732 --> 16:25.332
- Hurry up!
- It's here.

16:29.771 --> 16:33.571
That's from a true gentleman,
I wouldn't have even given you 20 euros.

17:26.726 --> 17:28.646
- Hi, Gennaro.
- Hi, Patrizia.

17:30.326 --> 17:31.886
C'mon, guys.

17:39.845 --> 17:41.965
Guys, the situation's not good.

17:43.365 --> 17:46.565
- The Capaccios want war.
- We gotta kill 'em all.

17:50.164 --> 17:51.604
No.

17:54.004 --> 17:57.082
You gotta keep calm until I tell you.

17:57.084 --> 17:59.042
Stay with your families,

17:59.044 --> 18:02.803
if anyone asks where you were
they can back you up.

18:04.243 --> 18:05.683
Why?

18:09.683 --> 18:14.802
Because I'm gonna make it rain blood
and I don't want you to get wet.

18:16.442 --> 18:17.922
Is that clear?

18:21.202 --> 18:23.360
He's right.

18:23.362 --> 18:24.962
That's all.

18:26.361 --> 18:28.121
Let's go, Patrizia.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.000
Gennaro.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.878
If our people know it's gonna rain

18:47.880 --> 18:50.759
they won't wanna stay
underwater doing nothing.

18:52.519 --> 18:54.997
You need to tell them
what you got in mind.

18:54.999 --> 18:57.199
For now only you and me
need to know.

19:00.919 --> 19:02.956
Never forget one thing,

19:02.958 --> 19:04.796
he who commands is like a father,

19:04.798 --> 19:08.918
he doesn't need to explain the problem
to his kids, he has to fix it.

19:12.918 --> 19:14.837
Put it in the back.

19:23.637 --> 19:25.675
- Did you pay?
- Yeah, but didn't need to.

19:25.677 --> 19:29.236
Asshole, you can't steal Christ's Tears.

19:51.314 --> 19:56.912
It was a goldfinch that took the thorns
from Jesus' forehead when he died.

19:56.914 --> 19:59.954
And so a drop of blood
stained its forehead.

20:03.273 --> 20:07.313
It was as rare as this one,
and like this one it was special.

20:08.993 --> 20:11.751
What's special about it?

20:11.753 --> 20:14.472
They call it a "color bearer",
it's very rare.

20:17.352 --> 20:21.310
- It doesn't have any color.
- He'll pass it down to his offspring.

20:21.312 --> 20:23.672
That's why he's so special.

21:32.466 --> 21:33.986
Good morning, Don Savastano.

22:02.223 --> 22:06.261
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with Thee.

22:06.263 --> 22:08.581
Blessed art Thou among women

22:08.583 --> 22:11.461
and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb, Jesus.

22:11.463 --> 22:16.140
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

22:16.142 --> 22:19.500
now and at the hour of our death.

22:19.502 --> 22:24.182
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

22:26.981 --> 22:29.181
Hi, Uncle.

22:36.941 --> 22:38.420
Gennaro.

22:41.460 --> 22:45.298
- How long's it been?
- A long time.

22:45.300 --> 22:49.737
It definitely wasn't because of me,
it was your father.

22:49.739 --> 22:54.819
He said he didn't want to be with us,
it was better that way for his family.

22:57.659 --> 23:02.018
I saw my wife cry a lot
when they killed your mother.

23:03.858 --> 23:06.098
Is that how he protected her?

23:10.218 --> 23:15.817
My father paid for what he did
and now he's resting in peace with Mom.

23:17.577 --> 23:21.177
But we're still here,
trying to do the best we can.

23:23.497 --> 23:25.217
You're right.

23:27.216 --> 23:30.376
- I'd like you to meet Patrizia.
- Hello.

23:32.736 --> 23:37.016
Sit next to me. This way, Miss.
Take a seat.

23:43.375 --> 23:44.895
Hi, Aunty.

23:53.374 --> 23:55.812
Gennaro...

23:55.814 --> 23:58.454
Enjoy your meal.

23:59.934 --> 24:02.731
Only a little for me, Mom.

24:02.733 --> 24:05.251
- Mom, a lot for me.
- You're fading away.

24:05.253 --> 24:07.973
- There you go.
- Thanks.

24:20.052 --> 24:22.492
Central Naples is like a siren.

24:24.932 --> 24:27.011
She's there watching you.

24:28.131 --> 24:31.051
Then you hear her singing
and you fall in love...

24:32.851 --> 24:35.731
...and meanwhile
you've smashed into the rocks.

24:37.211 --> 24:40.850
Uncle, I'm under attack.

24:42.730 --> 24:44.930
I need your help.

24:57.929 --> 25:01.007
- Nice to meet you. Mickey.
- Don't bother the lady.

25:01.009 --> 25:05.606
If she wants to ask me for the water,
she doesn't know what to call me.

25:05.608 --> 25:07.166
She can ask me.

25:07.168 --> 25:10.768
Grazia, leave your brother alone
and help me clear the table.

25:15.527 --> 25:17.407
My name's Patrizia.

25:18.487 --> 25:20.847
See? Her name's Patrizia.

25:22.367 --> 25:23.887
Nice to meet you.

25:29.406 --> 25:31.566
- Will you excuse me?
- Of course.

25:38.085 --> 25:40.285
Uncle, I have a surprise for you.

25:53.964 --> 25:56.682
Christ's Tears.

25:56.684 --> 25:59.644
The hope of always being reborn
into a new life.

26:03.763 --> 26:08.603
I was afraid that seeing you,
I would have seen your father.

26:13.163 --> 26:15.522
Instead you have your mother's eyes.

26:17.402 --> 26:22.200
What Pietro refused to understand
was the strength of family.

26:22.202 --> 26:25.801
Today you have a problem,
tomorrow I have one...

26:32.681 --> 26:34.521
He's so beautiful.

26:35.961 --> 26:38.320
Little guy.

26:44.760 --> 26:49.519
Everything you asked me,
consider it done, Gennaro.

26:53.119 --> 26:55.279
Thank you, Uncle.

27:05.998 --> 27:07.638
It's nice here, huh?

27:10.518 --> 27:11.878
The truth?

27:12.918 --> 27:16.275
I don't like the country one little bit.

27:16.277 --> 27:17.797
Why's that?

27:20.677 --> 27:23.235
We come from the earth,
we return to the earth

27:23.237 --> 27:26.116
and I don't want
to get muddy in between.

27:28.676 --> 27:31.034
I'll tell you a secret,

27:31.036 --> 27:33.994
I don't like the country either.

27:33.996 --> 27:36.996
That's why I went
to university in Bologna.

27:39.035 --> 27:40.993
But you came back here.

27:40.995 --> 27:44.275
Like plants,
our roots are difficult to break.

27:46.915 --> 27:49.392
I don't have any.

27:49.394 --> 27:51.194
That's impossible.

27:52.394 --> 27:55.874
You don't have a home,
a family, nothing?

27:56.914 --> 28:01.593
Everything I have fits in a suitcase
and I don't want to open it.

28:02.953 --> 28:04.953
And don't you miss it?

28:11.193 --> 28:13.752
What am I supposed to miss?

28:50.709 --> 28:53.347
Come here, don't be afraid.

28:53.349 --> 28:57.307
Easy does it.
Come here, my beauty.

28:57.309 --> 28:59.269
This one's worth a lot, right?

29:06.308 --> 29:07.788
Come.

29:09.108 --> 29:11.226
Don't be afraid.

29:11.228 --> 29:13.345
I got him.

29:13.347 --> 29:15.827
I'll put him in, or he might escape.

29:20.747 --> 29:23.305
You made friends with the girl.

29:23.307 --> 29:26.944
- She's very smart.
- She'll never be smart enough.

29:26.946 --> 29:29.506
She's a woman,
she needs to stay in her place.

29:31.226 --> 29:34.024
Maybe the world's changing, Dad.

29:34.026 --> 29:36.584
The world's changing,

29:36.586 --> 29:40.383
but we stay the same,
that's our strength.

29:40.385 --> 29:44.063
Mickey, take your jacket off
and grab a bag.

29:44.065 --> 29:45.465
Coming.

30:12.023 --> 30:14.182
I still haven't told you...

30:19.142 --> 30:21.782
I'm sorry about Ciro.

31:58.214 --> 32:00.172
- How long do we have?
- It's for tonight.

32:00.174 --> 32:04.291
I spoke to the Albanians,
the meetup's at the betting shop.

32:04.293 --> 32:06.491
We gotta hurry.

32:06.493 --> 32:08.093
C'mon, move it.

32:53.089 --> 32:57.529
Look, you turn it on here
and press this button.

33:12.128 --> 33:13.847
Everything's ready.

33:15.207 --> 33:20.685
The neighborhood's completely secured.
If they stop you, you know what to say?

33:20.687 --> 33:23.005
Good girl, go.

33:23.007 --> 33:25.124
Whatever you need.

33:25.126 --> 33:27.006
And drive slowly.

34:24.681 --> 34:27.039
- Where are you going?
- I'm a friend of Papele's niece.

34:27.041 --> 34:29.201
I came to show her the kid.

34:33.201 --> 34:35.201
Andrea, all good!

34:37.520 --> 34:39.239
Nicola, all good.

35:52.354 --> 35:55.912
- Hi, guys. Was the trip good?
- Smooth as butter.

35:55.914 --> 35:58.754
This is Crazy, Capaccio's other brother.

37:39.785 --> 37:43.103
The person who brought the car in
is not from Secondigliano.

37:43.105 --> 37:45.983
We had nothing to do with the bomb.

37:45.985 --> 37:49.864
- Nor do we know who it was.
- But we have to answer back.

37:58.264 --> 38:02.783
Valerio, loyalty is a fine quality,
if you choose the right person.

38:04.823 --> 38:07.661
But if they're heading for disaster,
so are you.

38:07.663 --> 38:09.661
We're not the ones heading for disaster.

38:09.663 --> 38:11.183
Maybe not today.

38:17.782 --> 38:19.862
But tomorrow?

38:21.742 --> 38:24.020
Let's be clear about one thing:

38:24.022 --> 38:27.539
I came alone today
but Enzo is here with me.

38:27.541 --> 38:29.901
What you do is none of our business.

38:31.781 --> 38:35.661
The first rule in Switzerland
is to mind one's own business.

38:48.899 --> 38:51.099
Did you speak to Loran?

38:52.579 --> 38:54.819
What did that Albanian turd tell you?

39:03.258 --> 39:07.456
<i>A loud explosion, flames,
the wounded screaming for help.</i>

39:07.458 --> 39:12.496
<i>A horrifying scene
for the first responders...</i>

39:12.498 --> 39:14.495
He crashed.

39:14.497 --> 39:17.215
You can tell he's been playing
all afternoon.

39:17.217 --> 39:19.775
He didn't even finish eating.

39:19.777 --> 39:21.897
Did you really have to?

39:25.296 --> 39:27.296
There were kids there.

39:28.736 --> 39:32.336
- Nothing happened to them.
- But it could have.

39:35.856 --> 39:38.893
Before a sunny day
you need a storm to clean the air.

39:38.895 --> 39:41.333
You said it.

39:41.335 --> 39:44.333
You promised that you'd end this war,
remember?

39:44.335 --> 39:48.894
I remember, actually
I stopped it before it started.

39:55.054 --> 39:57.494
Blue Blood didn't help Gennaro.

39:58.774 --> 40:02.253
The Albanians told the Levantes
that you were at the betting shop.

40:05.973 --> 40:09.491
What do the Levantes have to do
with Gennaro Savastano?

40:09.493 --> 40:14.650
They're related, Donna Imma and
Gerlando Levante's wife were cousins.

40:14.652 --> 40:16.770
Don Pietro didn't want
to see them anymore

40:16.772 --> 40:18.930
after the Levantes became affiliated
with the Sicilians.

40:18.932 --> 40:24.050
He was scared they'd devour him
and Secondigliano.

40:24.052 --> 40:26.691
That asshole son of his
isn't afraid, though.

40:28.651 --> 40:32.409
Gennaro feels stronger,
but he needs to be careful,

40:32.411 --> 40:34.529
they're very powerful.

40:34.531 --> 40:38.090
Gennaro can get God Almighty
to help him, I don't give a shit.

40:39.690 --> 40:42.808
We gotta fight back,
we gotta get even straightaway.

40:42.810 --> 40:45.848
This isn't the time to get angry.

40:45.850 --> 40:49.489
You came to my house to talk to me,
you need to listen to me.

40:55.769 --> 40:59.609
You can't afford a war
with the Levantes and Gennaro.

41:01.328 --> 41:03.648
You need to reach an agreement.

41:04.848 --> 41:07.488
I'll be the guarantor for a meeting.

42:33.481 --> 42:35.481
- Hi, Patrizia.
- Gennaro.

42:57.239 --> 42:59.799
So, what did you want
to talk to us about?

43:05.478 --> 43:08.398
We thought the best thing
is to make a deal between us.

43:16.797 --> 43:19.557
That's exactly what I thought.

43:22.797 --> 43:24.836
The deal is this.

43:26.196 --> 43:28.714
Three things have to be sacred
for all of us.

43:28.716 --> 43:32.114
The first: Secondigliano
has to be independent,

43:32.116 --> 43:34.834
not under the control
of the other clans.

43:34.836 --> 43:39.435
I will guarantee that Secondigliano will
not make any requests in your areas.

43:40.715 --> 43:44.595
The second:
enough with wars.

43:46.075 --> 43:50.272
Wars are bad for everybody,
and especially for business.

43:50.274 --> 43:52.792
The cops need to forget our faces,

43:52.794 --> 43:55.912
for them we all need
to come across as brothers,

43:55.914 --> 43:58.954
even though we never have been
and never will be.

44:00.873 --> 44:04.751
The third: whoever wants to do business
with Secondigliano is welcome.

44:04.753 --> 44:06.671
The price will be the same for everybody

44:06.673 --> 44:10.793
and everybody will sell at the same
agreed price in their area.

44:11.953 --> 44:14.112
That way there is no competition.

44:15.712 --> 44:17.632
And what do you earn?

44:22.352 --> 44:25.549
Freedom,

44:25.551 --> 44:27.869
for me and for my family.

44:27.871 --> 44:30.071
What does that mean?

44:31.951 --> 44:35.031
That from tomorrow in Secondigliano
Donna Patrizia is in charge.

44:46.310 --> 44:50.107
Only a woman can raise a child properly.

44:50.109 --> 44:54.027
And this peace is like a child,

44:54.029 --> 44:56.787
and it will have Donna Patrizia
as its mother

44:56.789 --> 44:59.229
and Gerlando Levante as its father.

45:03.108 --> 45:06.946
Nothing changes for you,
Patrizia has my suppliers.

45:06.948 --> 45:09.468
You pay her
and she'll give you the stuff.

45:14.267 --> 45:16.467
Are we all agreed?

45:21.347 --> 45:23.227
And you?

45:35.186 --> 45:37.665
From today on
you won't see me ever again.

45:42.185 --> 45:44.585
I wish you all good luck.

46:29.501 --> 46:31.821
What is this place, Gennaro?

46:36.900 --> 46:38.500
It's a surprise.

46:49.699 --> 46:51.459
Come.

47:17.417 --> 47:20.337
This is the first day of our new life.

47:23.697 --> 47:26.734
This place is like us,

47:26.736 --> 47:29.616
for everybody else,
it's not worth anything now.

47:32.096 --> 47:36.175
But from tomorrow this will be
the biggest thing that's ever been seen.
