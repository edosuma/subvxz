00:41.934 --> 00:45.266
(mellow music playing)

01:00.133 --> 01:01.734
Stand up straight.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.433
I am standing straight.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.033
No, you're not.
You're slouching.

01:05.100 --> 01:07.200
You're trying to pretend you're not tall.
You do it all the time.

01:07.266 --> 01:09.533
-I do not.
-Yes, you do.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.400
Ever since you changed schools
in the fourth grade

01:11.467 --> 01:14.600
and the kids thought you were
the substitute teacher.

01:15.433 --> 01:16.567
Well, girls, I did it.

01:16.633 --> 01:20.133
I finally broke down and bought that dress
I've been eyeing for a month.

01:20.200 --> 01:23.333
I thought you were gonna wear the same
silk one you wore to last year's banquet.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.500
Oh, no, I changed my mind.

01:24.567 --> 01:26.734
I decided too many people
would recognize it.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.600
It is such a stunning shade of green.

01:28.667 --> 01:30.700
The only thing they'll remember
is the way you fall out of it.

01:30.767 --> 01:31.967
Oh, Sophia.

01:32.033 --> 01:34.700
If you asked people the color,
half of them would say flesh-tone.

01:34.767 --> 01:36.233
Sophia!

01:36.300 --> 01:38.667
Blanche, forgive her.
Ma's a little irritable today.

01:38.734 --> 01:40.533
She doesn't have a date
for the banquet.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.700
I'm just being picky.
The banquet dinner's a big deal.

01:42.767 --> 01:44.367
I don't want to go with just anyone.

01:44.433 --> 01:47.033
Well, you know,
I don't have a date yet, either.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.667
Blanche Devereaux can't find a date?

01:49.734 --> 01:51.300
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

01:51.367 --> 01:53.133
My only problem is trying to decide

01:53.200 --> 01:56.000
which of my many suitors
to flatter with an invitation.

01:56.066 --> 01:58.266
After all, it's the social event
of the season.

01:58.333 --> 02:01.667
I guess you'll just have to break
a few hundred hearts, Blanche.

02:01.734 --> 02:04.166
I know. I haven't had to disappoint
so many men

02:04.233 --> 02:06.400
since daddy tore down the tree house.

02:11.066 --> 02:13.000
Does anyone know
where the aspirin is?

02:13.066 --> 02:15.467
Buffered, time-release or synthetic?

02:16.767 --> 02:17.967
Time-release, I guess.

02:18.033 --> 02:19.834
Capsule, tablet or liquid?

02:21.033 --> 02:22.133
Gee, I don't know.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.300
Don't take the one
with the childproof cap.

02:24.367 --> 02:26.500
You could die before
you get the bottle open.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.967
What's the matter, honey?
Aren't you feeling well?

02:30.033 --> 02:31.400
Oh, just a little achy, that's all.

02:31.467 --> 02:35.700
Achy? What kind of achy? Headachy,
stomach-achy, back-achy, what achy?

02:35.767 --> 02:39.667
Oh, Dorothy, relax. It's probably
just a little cold. She'll be all right.

02:39.734 --> 02:41.333
Yes, but I won't.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.333
I hear a story about somebody
catching a cold, and I get one.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.333
I am very susceptible.
I have low resistance.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.433
I have a tendency
to be anemic, right, ma?

02:49.500 --> 02:52.000
-You're a hypochondriac.
-That, too.

02:52.066 --> 02:53.333
Ahchoo.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.600
(Rose) Oh, Gesundheit.

02:54.667 --> 02:56.400
Stay away from me, Rose.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.133
Will you hold still!
If you don't let me finish,

02:58.200 --> 02:59.667
I'll never get this dress ready
by Saturday.

02:59.734 --> 03:03.467
If I get near her, I won't need it
on Saturday. I'll be home in bed.

03:03.533 --> 03:04.767
Dorothy.

03:06.867 --> 03:10.467
Don't worry.
We'll all be at that charity dinner.

03:10.533 --> 03:11.667
This is just an allergy.

03:11.734 --> 03:14.300
Believe me, if I were coming down
with something, I'd know it.

03:14.367 --> 03:16.467
And I wouldn't risk
getting the rest of you sick.

03:16.533 --> 03:19.000
You don't have to worry about me,
honey. I never get sick.

03:19.066 --> 03:22.900
I take very good care of myself.
I treat my body like a temple.

03:22.967 --> 03:25.433
Yeah, open to everyone, day or night.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.333
(sighs)

03:32.300 --> 03:33.900
Ahchoo.

03:33.967 --> 03:36.667
(coughs)

03:36.734 --> 03:38.934
(blows nose)

03:39.000 --> 03:43.033
(moans and groans)

03:49.000 --> 03:52.300
Oh... I feel hot.

03:52.367 --> 03:54.700
Oh, I feel cold.

03:54.767 --> 03:59.266
I feel guilty. This is all my fault.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.467
Oh, no, Rose. It's all my fault.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.400
The minute I found out
you were contagious,

04:03.467 --> 04:05.800
I should have thrown you
out on the street.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.967
I said I was sorry.

04:09.033 --> 04:10.934
Oh, I feel just terrible.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.433
My eyes are all puffy,

04:12.500 --> 04:15.433
my nose is red, my glands are swollen.

04:15.500 --> 04:19.867
Isn't it amazing how I can feel so bad
and still look so good?

04:21.667 --> 04:23.400
I can't believe it.

04:23.467 --> 04:25.467
Vinnie Bataglia, the biggest jerk I know,

04:25.533 --> 04:27.834
just turned down my invitation
to the charity banquet.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.767
Ma, if he's such a big jerk,
why'd you ask him in the first place?

04:30.834 --> 04:32.266
Because he's the only guy my age

04:32.333 --> 04:37.333
who doesn't wear his pants
up to his chin. I hate that.

04:37.400 --> 04:40.200
Personally, that never bothers me.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.266
It just looks so painful.

04:45.633 --> 04:46.867
(doorbell rings)

04:46.934 --> 04:48.333
Ma, do you mind answering that?

04:48.400 --> 04:51.300
Why not? Maybe I'll get lucky.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.533
(Sophia) What am I talking about?

04:53.600 --> 04:55.900
If I was lucky,
I'd be shacking up with Cary Grant.

04:57.934 --> 05:01.333
Hello. I'm Dr. Richmond.
I'm looking for a Dorothy Zbornak?

05:01.400 --> 05:03.133
Dr. Richmond,
it's a pleasure to meet you,

05:03.200 --> 05:04.900
but we were expecting Dr. Harris.

05:04.967 --> 05:08.033
I'm afraid Dr. Harris couldn't make it.
His wife's having a baby.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.233
Oh, well, normally,
I'd be happy for him,

05:10.300 --> 05:14.166
but right now, I couldn't care less.
What are you going to do for us?

05:14.233 --> 05:18.500
Well, why don't you tell me the kind of
symptoms you've been having?

05:18.567 --> 05:21.700
Well, I have a fever
and my throat is sore

05:21.767 --> 05:23.900
and my stomach is upset,

05:23.967 --> 05:26.467
and I keep having this recurring dream

05:26.533 --> 05:30.934
where I'm being chased
by a giant Listerine bottle.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.767
When I open my mouth to scream,
all I can do is gargle.

05:35.934 --> 05:36.967
Ah.

05:37.567 --> 05:39.033
Are you experiencing
the same symptoms?

05:39.100 --> 05:43.533
Yes, except in my dream,
I'm chased by a bottle of Scope.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.700
(coughing)

05:45.767 --> 05:49.367
Well, let's have a look at you, hmm?

05:52.900 --> 05:56.567
This is the first time a female doctor's
ever examined me.

05:56.633 --> 05:59.066
Feels kind of strange.

05:59.133 --> 06:00.667
I hear that a lot.

06:00.734 --> 06:01.800
You know, the truth is,

06:01.867 --> 06:04.000
despite the progress
that women have made,

06:04.066 --> 06:05.767
medicine is still a man's world.

06:06.533 --> 06:10.834
So... if it'll make you feel any better,
I used to be a man.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.233
What?

06:16.300 --> 06:19.100
Just a little female doctor humor.
(laughs)

06:21.300 --> 06:24.100
All right, so what's the verdict?

06:24.166 --> 06:28.667
Well, ladies, the flu is going around,
and I'm afraid you've all got it.

06:28.734 --> 06:30.200
I told them that two days ago.

06:30.266 --> 06:32.934
Tell them something new for $50.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.433
How long is it going to last?
24 hours, 48?

06:36.500 --> 06:37.934
We're talking at least a week.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.233
-A week?
-Oh.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.266
But we have to go to a banquet
Saturday night.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.133
Can't you give us a pill or something?

06:43.200 --> 06:46.533
Sorry, ladies. You're just going
to have to wait this one out.

06:46.600 --> 06:50.266
Now drink plenty of liquids,
get lots of rest,

06:50.333 --> 06:53.233
and if you're not better by Monday,
give me a call.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.100
Oh, I can't believe it.

06:55.166 --> 06:58.533
If modern science can come up
with cinnamon dental floss,

06:58.600 --> 07:01.600
why can't they cure the flu?

07:01.667 --> 07:03.500
Modern science is overrated.

07:03.567 --> 07:05.633
Sometimes home remedies
can work a lot better.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.266
You know, Sophia,
you're absolutely right.

07:07.333 --> 07:10.600
When I was little, mama used to
rub eucalyptus oil on our necks

07:10.667 --> 07:12.700
and then tie a sock around
to keep it warm.

07:12.767 --> 07:14.900
Why, it cleared your sinuses up
just like that.

07:14.967 --> 07:20.233
My mother always used to sing to us
and make us gingerbread men.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.667
Really, Rose?

07:21.734 --> 07:25.467
I think Michael DeBakey does that
before surgery.

07:25.533 --> 07:27.967
In Sicily, we never went to the doctor.

07:28.033 --> 07:30.367
We went to the widow Caravelle.

07:30.433 --> 07:33.066
Whatever you had, she had a cure.

07:33.633 --> 07:36.533
She was best known for this
green salve she used to make

07:36.600 --> 07:38.500
to treat ear infections.

07:39.100 --> 07:41.767
One day, she gave a batch to Salvador,
the village idiot.

07:43.900 --> 07:45.734
He misunderstood the directions

07:45.800 --> 07:49.166
and put it on his linguine
instead of in his ear.

07:57.934 --> 08:00.066
I guess if you're an idiot
with a hearing problem,

08:00.133 --> 08:01.767
you do things like that.

08:04.133 --> 08:06.734
As it turns out, it wasn't
such a bad thing to do.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.500
The stuff tasted great,

08:08.567 --> 08:10.834
and Salvador decided to market it.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.300
At first, it didn't move so well.

08:13.367 --> 08:17.300
Linguine with ear salve on a menu
doesn't look too appetizing.

08:18.367 --> 08:22.600
But once he changed the name
to pesto sauce,

08:22.667 --> 08:23.967
it moved like hotcakes.

08:24.033 --> 08:25.734
Ma, you're making this up.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.567
So what? I'm old.
I'm supposed to be colorful.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.867
(somber music playing)

08:42.066 --> 08:45.900
Dorothy, where's my heating pad?

08:47.400 --> 08:48.834
How should I know?

08:48.900 --> 08:51.934
If this isn't it, I'd like to know
what other electrical appliance

08:52.000 --> 08:54.266
you're using under that blanket.

09:01.700 --> 09:05.033
Blanche, you can't have it. I need it.
My chest is congested.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.233
Well, what about my chest?
It needs heat, too.

09:07.300 --> 09:10.367
I don't care about your chest.
I just care about my chest.

09:10.433 --> 09:12.700
Well, you're the only one who does.

09:13.567 --> 09:15.200
Okay, Dorothy, slip this on.

09:15.266 --> 09:18.066
Oh, forget it, ma. I don't have
the strength to stand up.

09:18.133 --> 09:20.767
If you don't try it on now,
I can't finish it by Saturday.

09:20.834 --> 09:23.967
Who am I kidding? I'm not going to be able
to go to that banquet.

09:24.033 --> 09:26.667
None of us is.
We won't be better by then.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.100
Fine. Can I have your date?

09:28.166 --> 09:30.633
Of course, ma.
You can have my date, my dress

09:30.700 --> 09:32.333
and the dessert at the dinner.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.100
Just leave me alone
with my thermometer

09:34.166 --> 09:36.400
and the one nostril
I can breathe out of.

09:36.934 --> 09:38.100
Great news, girls.

09:38.166 --> 09:42.033
I found my folk medicine book.
It has a cure for everything.

09:42.100 --> 09:45.500
I hope it has a cure for crankiness.
A lot of that going around.

09:45.567 --> 09:49.200
Cranky? Cranky... would it
be under anything else?

09:49.266 --> 09:51.166
-Try Dorothy.
-Try Blanche.

09:51.233 --> 09:54.567
Oh, come on, girls.
Now let's put on a happy face.

09:54.633 --> 09:56.467
We'll get better much faster.

09:56.533 --> 09:59.567
My cousin Dennis
was a perfect example of that.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.367
When he was 16 years old,

10:01.433 --> 10:04.066
he caught his sideburns
in the hay baler. And then--

10:04.133 --> 10:05.934
-Shut up, Rose.
-Shut up, Rose.

10:07.266 --> 10:09.033
Well, excuse me.

10:09.100 --> 10:12.200
I didn't realize
it was gang up on Rose day.

10:12.266 --> 10:16.033
I have been cooped up listening to your
stupid stories for three days now.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.900
You're just lucky it isn't string Rose up
from a tree day.

10:19.967 --> 10:23.800
Well, I'm not going to let you two
gloomy Guses rain on my parade.

10:23.867 --> 10:25.667
I'm just gonna keep on smiling.

10:25.734 --> 10:27.467
Rose, you're sick as a dog.

10:27.533 --> 10:30.100
How can you be so disgustingly cheerful?

10:30.166 --> 10:31.867
It's my folk medicine book.

10:31.934 --> 10:35.166
It has the most wonderful
hot toddy recipe. Here, taste.

10:37.667 --> 10:38.834
(gulps)

10:38.900 --> 10:42.967
Rose, this stuff should have
an octane rating.

10:43.867 --> 10:45.800
I know. Ha-ha.

10:48.133 --> 10:50.500
(blows nose)

10:50.567 --> 10:52.433
Must you do that?

10:52.500 --> 10:56.333
She can't help it, Blanche.
She has to blow her nose.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.700
Or is that a banana? (laughs)

11:03.967 --> 11:05.233
You miserable...

11:05.300 --> 11:08.834
Oh, would you two knock it off?
It's time for <i>Another World.</i>

11:08.900 --> 11:11.133
-You can't watch <i>Another World.</i>
-And why not?

11:11.200 --> 11:12.600
Because you watched it yesterday.

11:12.667 --> 11:15.767
That's exactly why I have to
watch it today, Dorothy.

11:15.834 --> 11:17.700
To find out what happens.

11:17.767 --> 11:18.900
That's why they always say,

11:18.967 --> 11:23.100
"Stay tuned for the continuing story
of <i>Another World."</i>

11:23.166 --> 11:26.300
Too bad, Blanche. Today,
it's my turn to choose,

11:26.367 --> 11:28.800
and we are not watching <i>Another World.</i>

11:28.867 --> 11:32.600
Oh, you are undoubtedly
the meanest sick person I've ever met,

11:32.667 --> 11:34.734
not to mention the most unattractive.

11:36.867 --> 11:39.633
Girls, why do we have to watch TV, anyway?

11:39.700 --> 11:42.266
There are plenty of other
fun things we can do.

11:42.333 --> 11:46.233
We can play cards,
listen to records, bake cookies.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.900
Now, we can't let this nasty flu
get us down.

11:48.967 --> 11:50.834
It's bad enough
we have to miss the banquet,

11:50.900 --> 11:54.500
must we also participate
in a girl scout jamboree?

11:55.600 --> 11:59.600
I was just trying to be kind,
courteous, helpful.

11:59.667 --> 12:01.767
Well, knock it off.

12:01.834 --> 12:04.533
I've had it up to here
with your cheerful disposition.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.333
Oh, do you think it's easy
to be cheerful around you two?

12:08.400 --> 12:11.734
You know how many of these
stinking hot toddies I have to drink

12:11.800 --> 12:13.700
to keep on a happy face?

12:14.767 --> 12:16.567
Well, I'm not gonna do it anymore.

12:16.633 --> 12:18.033
I'm not speaking to either of you.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.100
And I'm not speaking to you, either.

12:20.166 --> 12:22.233
Me, neither. To either of you.

12:22.300 --> 12:23.166
-Fine.
-Fine.

12:23.233 --> 12:24.333
Fine.

12:25.633 --> 12:27.934
Great news. I got a date.

12:32.233 --> 12:35.200
(doors slam)

12:35.266 --> 12:38.000
Well, excuse me for trying to have a life.

12:43.100 --> 12:46.066
(mellow music playing)

12:55.166 --> 12:57.367
Do we have any orange juice left?

13:07.033 --> 13:08.333
No, we're all out.

13:12.200 --> 13:15.333
All right, I want an answer,
and I want it now.

13:15.400 --> 13:19.133
Which one of you has been
dipping into my Vicks VapoRub?

13:20.033 --> 13:24.233
I took it. And my chest
was already completely coated.

13:24.300 --> 13:25.400
I did it out of spite

13:25.467 --> 13:29.734
because you lost the pre-measured cup
off my Nyquil.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.667
Rose, I took your stupid cup.
But you know why?

13:32.734 --> 13:37.500
Because I feel lousy, and being
mean to you makes me feel better.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.300
Dorothy Zbornak,

13:39.367 --> 13:43.033
you can go straight
to H-E-double hockey sticks.

13:44.266 --> 13:46.300
"Double hockey sticks"?

13:46.367 --> 13:49.467
Oh, what language.
My ears are burning.

13:50.367 --> 13:52.033
Rose Nylund, you know what you are?

13:52.100 --> 13:55.266
You are an A-1, first-class,
all-around nerd.

13:58.266 --> 14:01.200
Oh, honey, I didn't mean that.

14:01.734 --> 14:04.200
I'm sorry. Oh.

14:04.266 --> 14:06.467
It's just this flu is making me crazy.

14:06.533 --> 14:09.033
Oh, it's gotten to all of us.

14:09.100 --> 14:13.266
Do you know we have been
at each other's throats for two days?

14:13.333 --> 14:16.066
I've been the worst.
I hope you two can forgive me.

14:16.133 --> 14:17.567
Oh, girls, let's make a pact.

14:17.633 --> 14:20.633
Let's promise we're gonna help each other
get through this mess.

14:21.300 --> 14:25.500
Would I be too big a nerd
if I asked for a group hug?

14:25.567 --> 14:30.433
Oh, honey, of course not.

14:31.767 --> 14:33.333
What are you doing?

14:33.400 --> 14:35.266
We're having a group hug.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.200
Knock it off.
The neighbors will get the wrong idea.

14:41.533 --> 14:43.467
By the way, I just called
Harriet McConnell

14:43.533 --> 14:45.100
to cancel your reservations
to the banquet.

14:45.166 --> 14:46.233
Oh, thanks, ma.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.667
She was very disappointed
you all aren't coming,

14:48.734 --> 14:51.934
and I think it's because
one of you won the big award.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.333
The best friend of the friends
of good health award?

14:55.400 --> 14:56.166
Yeah.

14:56.233 --> 14:57.934
Why, what'd she say?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.533
It wasn't what she said,
it was what she didn't say.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.133
What didn't she say?

15:02.867 --> 15:05.233
How the hell do I know?
She didn't say it.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.333
I read between the lines.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.367
Rose, I wouldn't be one bit surprised
if you won that award.

15:11.433 --> 15:12.633
I think you're right, Blanche.

15:12.700 --> 15:14.800
Sure. You took part
in the walkathon

15:14.867 --> 15:16.600
and the bikeathon and the telethon.

15:17.266 --> 15:20.133
And the marathon,
but who keeps track?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.767
Oh, Blanche, I think you have
a better chance

15:22.834 --> 15:24.533
of winning that award than I have.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.433
You know, I think you have
a point there, Rose.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.667
Why, sure. You worked
with the senior citizens,

15:28.734 --> 15:31.100
you put in time
at the day-care center,

15:31.166 --> 15:35.000
and you were the volunteer dummy
for the firemen's CPR class.

15:35.967 --> 15:38.900
And don't forget, that...
that program was my idea, too.

15:39.767 --> 15:41.967
Oh, maybe you're right,
I might have a small chance.

15:42.033 --> 15:43.734
After all, besides you,
who else is there?

15:44.400 --> 15:47.734
Ahem. Ahem.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.867
Dorothy, please. Why don't you use
your handkerchief?

15:52.600 --> 15:55.667
Doesn't anybody remember
all the good work that I have done?

15:56.600 --> 15:58.467
Not really.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.233
I was co-chairman of the committee

16:00.300 --> 16:02.934
to raise funds for the new bloodmobile.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.633
I sold 49 cases of peanut brittle.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.367
You really think selling candy's

16:07.433 --> 16:10.233
gonna qualify you
for that prestigious award?

16:10.300 --> 16:11.667
Oh, excuse me.

16:11.734 --> 16:14.500
I didn't realize that slipping my tongue

16:14.567 --> 16:16.900
to half the firemen in the county

16:16.967 --> 16:19.233
was a more lofty social achievement.

16:21.033 --> 16:24.066
Well, I guess that settles it.
I guess I won the award.

16:25.533 --> 16:28.900
I'm gonna go to that banquet,
and I'm gonna call my date.

16:28.967 --> 16:31.266
Honey, if you can get a date
the way you look,

16:31.333 --> 16:32.734
you deserve that award.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.667
Well, why don't you call your date, too?

16:35.734 --> 16:37.166
I would love to have you there

16:37.233 --> 16:39.934
so you can eat your heart out
when I accept the award.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.533
Don't worry. I'm gonna be there.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.767
Because I'll be the one
accepting the award.

16:43.834 --> 16:45.800
Well, if you're both going,
I'm going, too.

16:45.867 --> 16:48.000
I have just as much chance
of winning as you do.

16:49.033 --> 16:51.367
You have done some good work, Dorothy.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.333
But not enough people like you.

16:56.133 --> 16:57.066
Sorry.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.533
Ma, what do you think?
Do I have a chance of winning?

17:01.600 --> 17:03.300
Absolutely.

17:03.367 --> 17:05.967
As long as they don't add
a swimsuit competition.

17:09.700 --> 17:12.367
(tranquil music playing)

17:16.400 --> 17:20.934
Ahchoo. Ahchoo. Ahchoo.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.834
Doesn't she have the most adorable
little sneeze?

17:23.900 --> 17:28.333
Ah... ah... ah... ahchoo!

17:30.667 --> 17:33.300
It's okay. I didn't want my salad, anyway.

17:34.767 --> 17:36.633
(coughs) I'm sorry.

17:36.700 --> 17:37.800
Sucret?

17:37.867 --> 17:40.867
Oh, no, thank you. I'm still
sucking on a Smith Brothers.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.567
Well, good evening, everybody.

17:45.066 --> 17:49.500
Ladies, you're certainly looking...
ha-ha... never mind.

17:50.266 --> 17:52.300
Where's your date, Blanche?

17:52.367 --> 17:54.367
Oh, he'll be along. Never fear.

17:54.433 --> 17:56.133
In plenty of time to see me win

17:56.200 --> 17:58.500
the best friend of the friends
of good health award.

17:58.567 --> 18:01.033
Blanche, you must
still be running a fever.

18:01.100 --> 18:04.800
You're hallucinating.
I am going to win that award.

18:04.867 --> 18:07.200
Ha-ha-ha.

18:09.133 --> 18:14.300
(coughs)

18:14.367 --> 18:17.400
I'm sorry we're late,
but we couldn't find the table.

18:17.467 --> 18:19.667
But then I recognized
Dorothy's hacking.

18:19.734 --> 18:22.900
Everybody, this is Raoul.

18:22.967 --> 18:24.734
It's a pleasure to be here.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.800
Well, looks like we're all here.

18:33.734 --> 18:37.066
Oh, there's my date now.
Why, he must be lost.

18:37.133 --> 18:39.934
I'll just go get him and bring him over.

18:40.734 --> 18:43.100
Tell me, where are you from, Raoul?

18:43.166 --> 18:45.400
It's a pleasure to be here.

18:47.834 --> 18:49.433
Raoul doesn't speak much English.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.600
Ma, where did you meet him?

18:50.667 --> 18:52.900
He owns a flower shop
next to the dog track.

18:52.967 --> 18:57.033
I won big yesterday, so I figured I'd
treat myself and rent him a tuxedo.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.433
You having fun, Raoul?

18:59.500 --> 19:02.033
It's a pleasure to be here.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.967
He kills me.

19:04.033 --> 19:07.734
Everybody, I want you to meet
my friend Tommy Cochran.

19:07.800 --> 19:11.200
Sit down, Tommy. Tommy's a writer.

19:11.266 --> 19:12.667
According to <i>The New York Times,</i>

19:12.734 --> 19:17.367
he is the most exciting new novelist
to come along since Mr. Norman Mailer.

19:17.433 --> 19:19.133
We met in the park last week.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.767
I was sitting there,
reading Tommy's latest book,

19:21.834 --> 19:24.233
and he came over and offered
to autograph it for me,

19:24.300 --> 19:26.834
and we've just been inseparable
ever since.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.066
Hey, Cochran, what are you
sitting with the guests for?

19:29.133 --> 19:31.133
It's time to serve the main course.

19:39.233 --> 19:43.633
-You want me to come back after dessert?
-No.

19:43.700 --> 19:46.233
-Do I have to give back the $25?
-Yes.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.233
I don't think that's fair.

19:49.300 --> 19:51.166
Then give me ten and get out of here.

19:57.066 --> 19:58.934
Well, what are you all looking at?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.900
All right, maybe I don't have a date.

20:01.433 --> 20:02.767
Maybe my date took one look at me

20:02.834 --> 20:05.633
and said he'd rather die
than be caught in public with me.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.667
And maybe he's right.
Maybe I do look awful.

20:07.734 --> 20:08.633
But think about this...

20:08.700 --> 20:10.800
I still look better
than either one of you.

20:17.166 --> 20:18.767
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

20:18.834 --> 20:21.233
And so, after I threw up,

20:21.300 --> 20:23.767
I pass out in this tattoo parlor, right,

20:23.834 --> 20:27.467
where I come to the next morning
just stinking to high heaven.

20:27.533 --> 20:31.133
I look down, and I've got this
scorpion tattooed on my belly.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.500
But it's nice work.
You want to see it?

20:32.567 --> 20:33.700
No!

20:33.767 --> 20:36.367
Dorothy, where did you find him?
He's disgusting.

20:36.433 --> 20:38.200
Well, at least I have a man.

20:38.266 --> 20:40.500
Have one? Sounds like
you swallowed one.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.700
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

20:44.767 --> 20:49.467
It's time to present The Friends of Good
Health's Best Friend of the Year award.

20:50.033 --> 20:52.066
(cheering)

20:53.533 --> 20:57.667
But before we go any further,
I have an announcement to make.

20:57.734 --> 21:00.367
Don Johnson, star of <i>Miami Vice,</i>

21:00.433 --> 21:03.900
who was originally scheduled to be here,
will be unable to attend.

21:03.967 --> 21:05.567
(all) Aw...

21:05.633 --> 21:08.600
However, the producers
of the show

21:08.667 --> 21:11.066
were kind enough
to send over the clothes

21:11.133 --> 21:13.133
that he was planning
to wear here tonight.

21:13.200 --> 21:16.500
(cheering)

21:20.567 --> 21:23.500
Girls, before she announces
the winner,

21:23.567 --> 21:26.567
I want to wish you both the best of luck.

21:26.633 --> 21:29.633
What harm can it do?
'Cause I'm gonna win the award.

21:29.700 --> 21:30.934
Why don't you just shut up?

21:31.400 --> 21:33.767
-Why don't you just shut up?
-Why don't you both just shut up?

21:33.834 --> 21:38.066
And now for the moment that
you have all been waiting for.

21:38.133 --> 21:41.734
The winner of the best friend
of the year award is...

21:45.633 --> 21:47.467
Miss Sophia Petrillo.

21:47.533 --> 21:49.700
Yeah!

22:13.934 --> 22:16.600
I'm very proud to win this award.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.700
Who would have guessed
an old lady with a tin can

22:18.767 --> 22:20.400
could raise so much dough?

22:25.133 --> 22:27.166
I... I would like to thank you all

22:27.233 --> 22:31.033
for choosing me to be
the best friend of the year.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.000
I'm a very lucky woman.

22:33.066 --> 22:35.000
Not only do I have

22:35.066 --> 22:37.734
a lot of friends in this community,

22:37.800 --> 22:40.500
but I have a lot
of good friends at home,

22:40.567 --> 22:44.166
friends who care about me
and care about each other.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.500
(Sophia) I count my blessings every day

22:47.567 --> 22:50.066
because I have the kind of friends

22:50.133 --> 22:52.967
who stand by you
through the bad and the good.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.166
When you're lucky enough
to find that kind of friendship,

22:57.233 --> 23:01.133
I... I guess you just want to
pass it on.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.834
(cheering)

23:05.400 --> 23:10.600
Wait. May I say a few words,
just to my friends 75 and over?

23:10.667 --> 23:13.934
I'd like you to take a good look
at your dates for this evening.

23:15.934 --> 23:17.900
Now take a look at mine.
Stand up, Raoul.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.767
The man is half my age.
Isn't he gorgeous?

23:25.600 --> 23:27.533
Let's give us both a big hand.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.834
Girls, girls, I am so sorry.

23:41.900 --> 23:43.533
Oh, so am I.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.066
Let's make a toast to friendship.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.767
-Oh. To friendship.
-To friendship.

23:48.834 --> 23:50.133
Ah... ah...

23:50.200 --> 23:51.934
(all) Ahchoo!

23:53.467 --> 23:56.033
(lively music playing)

24:00.166 --> 24:03.233
(closing theme music playing)
