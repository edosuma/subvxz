00:00.001 --> 00:01.068
Previously...

00:01.078 --> 00:03.317
Ana and I are engaged.
I want you to be my best man.

00:03.327 --> 00:06.078
I'll make you a deal. You don't
play video games, I don't get high.

00:06.088 --> 00:08.380
Hey! I didn't see you raised
your skill tier last week.

00:08.390 --> 00:10.601
Does it really matter what I
do when we aren't together?

00:10.611 --> 00:11.742
It does if you lie about it.

00:11.752 --> 00:14.556
I have some tax issues with the IRS.

00:14.566 --> 00:15.937
Are we gonna lose our home?

00:15.947 --> 00:17.247
I won't go back to school.

00:17.257 --> 00:19.874
I am 16. I can drop out! It is my life!

00:19.884 --> 00:21.643
Emma, you're the one.

00:21.653 --> 00:23.812
She won't marry me if
I don't finish school.

00:23.822 --> 00:25.309
High school friendships don't last.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.144
Can I ask what happened
between you and Tess?

00:27.154 --> 00:28.625
It's always bothered her.

00:28.660 --> 00:29.759
Hey!

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:39.704 --> 00:41.730
Well! If it isn't the best man, himself.

00:41.740 --> 00:43.598
Dad told me that he asked you.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.968
You know, being best man comes
with a lot of responsibility.

00:46.978 --> 00:48.870
You're gonna have to throw
him a bachelor party.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.606
Just don't get strippers.
It's, like, so Neanderthal.

00:51.616 --> 00:54.709
And you're probably gonna have to
throw an engagement party as well.

00:54.719 --> 00:57.512
What? I have to throw him an
engagement party? Really?

00:57.522 --> 00:58.580
How am I gonna do that?

00:58.590 --> 01:00.515
Throwing a party's easy.

01:00.525 --> 01:03.352
Just pick a theme and a place,
and it basically plans itself.

01:03.363 --> 01:05.887
Why don't we have it here?!

01:05.897 --> 01:08.556
The theme could be,
like, "Second Chances."

01:08.566 --> 01:10.472
Uh, I-I don't think that's a theme

01:10.483 --> 01:11.907
that Mike and Ana would appreciate.

01:11.918 --> 01:13.928
And no offense, I'm not
particularly interested

01:13.938 --> 01:16.839
in throwing an engagement
party for my ex-husband.

01:18.576 --> 01:19.842
I'll be right back.

01:24.281 --> 01:25.405
Hey!

01:25.416 --> 01:26.510
Hey.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.910
Uh, I just wanted to give you a heads up

01:28.920 --> 01:30.912
that Jesus won't be able
to work with you today.

01:30.922 --> 01:33.275
He's being assessed.
I had to drop him off at the school

01:33.286 --> 01:35.517
about 6:30 AM. It was brutal.

01:35.527 --> 01:38.520
Oh, wow. I mean, that's...
That's good news, right?

01:38.530 --> 01:39.854
I mean, that he wants to go back.

01:39.864 --> 01:42.857
Yeah, um, you and he talk about Emma?

01:42.867 --> 01:43.925
L-lately?

01:43.935 --> 01:45.960
Yeah, sure, I mean, a little.

01:45.970 --> 01:48.334
You know, made her a ring the other day.

01:48.345 --> 01:49.373
A ring?

01:49.384 --> 01:51.666
Yeah, you know, cause they're
going steady or whatever.

01:51.676 --> 01:54.803
He wanted to give her something.
So, he made a little wooden ring.

01:54.813 --> 01:56.612
Ah. Okay.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.483
Good morning.

02:04.756 --> 02:07.649
- Did she...
- I guess Brandon didn't say anything.

02:07.659 --> 02:08.782
Ah, good.

02:08.793 --> 02:11.519
The last thing I need is
another reason to hate me.

02:11.529 --> 02:13.588
Yeah! Yeah, me too.

02:13.598 --> 02:15.724
Uh, did you talk to Brandon?

02:15.734 --> 02:17.559
Yeah. He said he's fine.

02:17.569 --> 02:19.794
- Is he?
- I hope so.

02:19.804 --> 02:22.797
Well, I have to take Mason to preschool.

02:22.807 --> 02:25.808
So... have a good one.

02:28.646 --> 02:30.580
Come on, guys. We gotta go.

02:32.617 --> 02:34.642
Wow. When does that ever happen?

02:35.954 --> 02:37.854
Dude, feel free!

02:40.692 --> 02:43.585
Uh, listen, I know that we said
we wouldn't make a big deal

02:43.595 --> 02:46.855
about Jesus and Emma's betrothment,

02:46.865 --> 02:48.957
or whatever, but um...

02:48.967 --> 02:50.658
he... he gave her a ring.

02:50.668 --> 02:51.834
A ring?!

02:52.904 --> 02:55.563
What? An engagement ring?

02:55.573 --> 02:57.766
No, no, not an engagement
ring. I don't think.

02:57.776 --> 02:59.601
It's... it's a "going together" ring.

02:59.611 --> 03:01.157
It's... it's made of wood.

03:01.168 --> 03:02.384
Are you sure that's all it is?

03:02.395 --> 03:05.044
Because he told me the only reason
he wanted to go back to school,

03:05.055 --> 03:07.575
is because Emma said she wouldn't
marry him unless he did.

03:07.585 --> 03:08.610
Yeah. I-I don't...

03:08.620 --> 03:11.479
I think it's just, uh,
you know, Jesus being Jesus.

03:11.489 --> 03:13.515
I mean, Emma's got a good
head on her shoulders.

03:13.525 --> 03:18.653
I don't see her agreeing to
something like that, right?

03:19.764 --> 03:21.556
Hey! It... it's Dean.

03:21.566 --> 03:22.891
Uh, yeah! Come on in.

03:24.636 --> 03:26.795
The gate was open.

03:26.805 --> 03:28.390
Okay.

03:28.401 --> 03:29.697
I just wanted to let you know

03:29.707 --> 03:31.466
that the trust documents are all ready.

03:31.476 --> 03:33.768
I talked to your lender.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.470
And since you've never missed a payment,

03:35.480 --> 03:37.989
they're willing to take
Lena's dad off of the title

03:38.000 --> 03:39.130
without refinancing.

03:39.643 --> 03:41.743
You wanna stop by after work?

03:41.753 --> 03:44.779
I can explain everything.
You wanna say 5:00?

03:44.789 --> 03:46.781
Yeah, 5:00 sounds good.
Thank you very much.

03:46.791 --> 03:47.816
- Appreciate it.
- Cool.

03:47.826 --> 03:49.759
- See ya then.
- All right, thanks!

03:52.697 --> 03:54.196
We're taking my dad off the title?

03:54.207 --> 03:56.825
I wanted to see what was possible
before I brought anything up.

03:56.835 --> 03:59.828
Listen, Lena,
I-I'm just concerned. Okay?

03:59.838 --> 04:02.764
What... what if your dad has
financial troubles again?

04:02.774 --> 04:06.468
The trust only keeps us out of
probate court if one of us dies.

04:06.478 --> 04:08.670
It doesn't protect us from another lien.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.639
I just... I thought
that maybe we could...

04:11.649 --> 04:15.777
talk to your parents about
it tonight at dinner.

04:15.787 --> 04:17.545
I don't know. I don't... I don't know.

04:17.555 --> 04:19.454
Let me... think about it.

04:59.547 --> 05:02.297
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:04.903 --> 05:07.829
Wait... so you didn't take the pictures?

05:07.839 --> 05:09.864
It's supposed to be a self-portrait.

05:09.874 --> 05:12.600
Yeah, I, um...

05:12.610 --> 05:13.701
I just...

05:13.711 --> 05:16.604
thought there was something more...

05:16.614 --> 05:18.439
I don't know, authentic?

05:18.449 --> 05:22.477
About capturing these unaware moments.

05:22.487 --> 05:25.547
So, I asked my family to help me.

05:25.557 --> 05:27.472
I mean, otherwise,
I'm just so self-conscious.

05:27.483 --> 05:28.935
Yeah, but that's the point!

05:28.946 --> 05:30.919
The whole idea behind self-portraiture

05:30.929 --> 05:33.621
is the expression of self-consciousness.

05:33.631 --> 05:35.790
I mean, look at the work of Frida Kahlo,

05:35.800 --> 05:37.825
or Schiele, or even Cindy Sherman.

05:37.835 --> 05:40.562
I mean, they use their
discomfort with themselves.

05:40.572 --> 05:42.630
I mean, I don't think this piece even...

05:42.640 --> 05:44.532
knows what it wants to be.

05:44.542 --> 05:45.675
Because the artist doesn't.

05:46.844 --> 05:49.096
Casey... don't be a dick.

05:49.107 --> 05:50.805
Critique the work or
keep your mouth shut.

05:50.815 --> 05:51.839
Okay, everybody.

05:51.849 --> 05:54.642
Let's keep our feedback constructive.

05:54.652 --> 05:56.911
We need to give Callie a
chance to defend her work.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.880
I don't...

05:58.890 --> 06:00.648
Well, in your admission interview,

06:00.658 --> 06:02.417
you're gonna have to, so...

06:02.427 --> 06:03.526
think about it.

06:11.502 --> 06:13.143
I called you, like, a million times.

06:13.154 --> 06:14.178
I know. I just...

06:14.189 --> 06:15.830
I didn't want to do this over the phone.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.305
But I don't think I can be with
someone who's gonna lie to me.

06:18.910 --> 06:21.511
I won't do it again. I swear.

06:21.522 --> 06:23.089
Yeah, well, it's not just that.

06:23.915 --> 06:25.673
It's...

06:25.683 --> 06:26.708
Maybe this is dumb,

06:26.718 --> 06:27.842
but it kinda feels like

06:27.852 --> 06:30.878
some video game is more
important than me.

06:30.888 --> 06:34.515
And I don't think that's the
kind of boyfriend I want.

06:34.525 --> 06:36.618
No, no, no. It's... it's not.

06:36.628 --> 06:39.520
I... I promise. It's...

06:39.530 --> 06:41.564
You're the most important thing to me.

06:42.900 --> 06:45.627
Please. Just give me another chance.

06:45.637 --> 06:46.694
I won't lie to you again.

06:46.704 --> 06:48.704
I swear I'll make time for us.

06:53.745 --> 06:54.910
Okay.

07:01.886 --> 07:03.511
Hey!

07:03.521 --> 07:05.521
Oh. Mariana let me in.

07:07.892 --> 07:10.585
Um, Taylor?

07:10.595 --> 07:12.487
I know we were gonna
play this afternoon,

07:12.497 --> 07:14.495
but is it okay if we do it tomorrow?

07:14.506 --> 07:15.623
Why?

07:15.633 --> 07:18.401
Well, I... I just...

07:19.437 --> 07:21.496
Noah and I haven't seen
each other in a while,

07:21.506 --> 07:23.472
and um...

07:24.842 --> 07:27.510
It's cool. Whatever.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.613
Thanks.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.517
I'll text you later.

07:37.922 --> 07:40.481
I honestly don't know
where Dean went off to,

07:40.491 --> 07:42.450
but he'll be back soon.
Please have a seat.

07:42.460 --> 07:43.584
Okay. Thanks.

07:43.594 --> 07:45.620
Yeah. He... He said 5:00, right?

07:45.630 --> 07:48.489
Yeah, yeah.

07:48.499 --> 07:51.459
So, do you still keep in touch
with anyone from high school?

07:51.469 --> 07:52.601
No. Not really.

07:53.638 --> 07:55.763
Well, I... I see Tommy Hutchinson...

07:55.773 --> 07:57.573
sometimes, since he's on the force.

08:01.907 --> 08:02.938
You?

08:03.614 --> 08:05.773
Oh, no. No, I um...

08:05.783 --> 08:08.201
I lost touch with everyone when
I moved to the east coast.

08:08.212 --> 08:09.265
Ah.

08:11.656 --> 08:12.722
Yep.

08:14.659 --> 08:16.592
Simon, that's right.

08:18.496 --> 08:19.787
So, Jesus is exhausted.

08:19.797 --> 08:21.789
He's been doing testing all day.

08:21.799 --> 08:23.342
With his TBI, it's just a lot for him.

08:23.353 --> 08:26.135
So, I told him he could go ahead and
keep sleeping. I hope it's okay.

08:26.146 --> 08:28.730
- Of course, sweetheart.
- Absolutely.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.498
Pass the asparagus, will ya?

08:30.508 --> 08:31.733
Yeah.

08:31.743 --> 08:34.669
So, Callie, I understand you're
taking college classes now.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.604
It's just, um, art class.

08:36.614 --> 08:38.881
Don't say "just." Don't
diminish the importance of art.

08:40.485 --> 08:42.677
Um... Mom,

08:42.687 --> 08:44.846
where's that waterfall
you told me about?

08:44.856 --> 08:47.172
Um, Aaron and I are gonna
take a hike tomorrow.

08:47.183 --> 08:49.784
Oh, Cedar Creek. Yeah, it should
be beautiful this time of year.

08:49.794 --> 08:51.961
- I'll give you directions after dinner.
- Thank you.

08:51.972 --> 08:54.489
Um, which reminds me. I need the car.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.013
No, I need the car. I have to work.

08:56.024 --> 08:57.859
Brandon... you don't get first dibs

08:57.869 --> 08:59.560
because you're the oldest.

08:59.570 --> 09:01.562
No, I get first dibs
because I'm going to work.

09:01.572 --> 09:03.831
Hey, Moms, we need another car.

09:03.841 --> 09:06.186
We can't afford another car.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.602
The only reason we have three cars

09:07.612 --> 09:09.804
is because Grandpa Frank
gave us the Prius.

09:09.814 --> 09:11.439
Y'all should count yourselves lucky

09:11.449 --> 09:13.541
that you have one car to share.

09:13.551 --> 09:14.742
Pass the asparagus, would ya?

09:14.752 --> 09:16.410
I, uh, I already did, Grandpa.

09:16.420 --> 09:17.812
- It's right here.
- Oh!

09:17.822 --> 09:19.847
So you did. There it is.

09:19.857 --> 09:22.450
And how about you, young lady?

09:22.460 --> 09:23.751
You takin' over the world now?

09:23.761 --> 09:25.520
I'm trying, Grandpa.

09:26.597 --> 09:27.855
Any boys?

09:27.865 --> 09:31.159
- No.
- Um, what about Logan?

09:31.170 --> 09:32.860
He's the boy who moved in next door.

09:32.870 --> 09:34.529
- Oh?
- Oh!

09:34.539 --> 09:37.532
Yeah, no. Uh, we're just friends.
He has a girlfriend.

09:37.542 --> 09:38.800
Yeah. Well, when, uh...

09:38.810 --> 09:41.636
I met your grandmother,
she had a boyfriend.

09:41.646 --> 09:43.738
So, I became her friend,

09:43.748 --> 09:46.507
and then, when, uh, they broke up,

09:46.517 --> 09:48.576
she needed a shoulder to cry on.

09:48.586 --> 09:49.811
And guess who was there?

09:50.888 --> 09:52.780
And guess who Logan's mother is.

09:52.790 --> 09:54.482
Mom's first girlfriend.

09:54.492 --> 09:56.551
She was my first crush.

09:56.561 --> 09:57.785
That was all.

09:57.795 --> 09:59.720
Trust me. My father saw to that.

09:59.730 --> 10:00.922
What does that mean?

10:00.932 --> 10:02.824
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

10:02.834 --> 10:06.661
Just one night, my father caught
Tess and me cuddling on the couch,

10:06.671 --> 10:10.673
and, uh, so he sent me to
church for "counseling."

10:12.910 --> 10:14.877
He did? That sucks.

10:16.814 --> 10:18.639
Well, that's a shame.

10:18.649 --> 10:20.741
Water under the bridge.

10:20.751 --> 10:22.618
This um...

10:23.955 --> 10:25.813
- This is...
- Asparagus, Grandpa.

10:25.823 --> 10:27.890
Yeah, asparagus. This... it's delicious.

10:33.599 --> 10:35.698
So, we're uh... we're putting
the house into a trust.

10:36.767 --> 10:38.559
- Hmm.
- Oh?

10:38.569 --> 10:39.727
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:39.737 --> 10:41.929
Just, uh, to protect the kids.

10:41.939 --> 10:43.898
Just in case anything happens.

10:43.908 --> 10:45.967
- Well, that's smart.
- Thank you.

10:45.977 --> 10:48.936
Which, you know,
got us to thinking that, uh...

10:48.946 --> 10:50.880
What?

10:52.783 --> 10:54.650
Um, maybe later.

10:57.989 --> 10:59.714
So...

10:59.724 --> 11:02.717
what else is going on with this big,
beautiful bustling family?

11:02.728 --> 11:05.562
Well... Jesus is engaged.

11:15.428 --> 11:17.587
He's only going back to
school because of this girl?

11:17.597 --> 11:18.822
That's absurd!

11:18.832 --> 11:20.590
Mom, we need something!

11:20.600 --> 11:22.425
Something that matters to him.

11:22.435 --> 11:24.484
You have something that matters to him.

11:24.495 --> 11:25.789
The treehouse!

11:25.800 --> 11:27.831
Maybe Jesus needs to
actually do something

11:27.841 --> 11:29.699
to earn the privilege of building it.

11:29.709 --> 11:31.401
Like getting an education.

11:31.411 --> 11:33.047
Mom, if we take away that treehouse,

11:33.058 --> 11:34.851
he's only going to think
we're punishing him,

11:34.862 --> 11:37.187
and then we will have a full-blown
rebellion on our hands.

11:37.213 --> 11:40.133
I agree. If we use it as leverage,
he's gonna hate us forever.

11:41.755 --> 11:44.714
Oh! Daddy's asleep.

11:44.724 --> 11:46.791
He had an early flight. He's been...

11:47.894 --> 11:49.594
He's been up since 4:30.

12:04.644 --> 12:07.437
What?

12:11.718 --> 12:14.711
How many songs do you think
we need for a full set?

12:14.721 --> 12:18.848
Uh... I don't know. Like, maybe,
ten or something like that.

12:18.858 --> 12:21.734
But, you know, we don't have to
write 'em all together either.

12:21.745 --> 12:24.729
If you want, you can play, like,
a solo or two if you want.

12:28.768 --> 12:30.368
Is everything okay?

12:31.805 --> 12:35.698
I caught Cort kissing Gabe last night.

12:35.708 --> 12:38.668
Oh. Is that weird for you?

12:38.678 --> 12:40.236
No.

12:40.254 --> 12:41.637
I mean, you know, it's whatever.

12:41.648 --> 12:43.548
I don't know. I just worry about her.

12:44.651 --> 12:46.609
She doesn't have the best taste in men.

12:46.619 --> 12:48.845
Her ex is a total douche.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.788
Well, she picked you.

13:01.768 --> 13:03.760
Honey, I know that it's uncomfortable,

13:03.770 --> 13:05.728
but we really need to talk to your dad

13:05.738 --> 13:07.530
about getting his name off the title.

13:07.540 --> 13:09.599
Right now? He's sleeping!

13:09.609 --> 13:12.435
And thanks a lot for bringing
it up at dinner, by the way.

13:12.445 --> 13:14.803
- I told you I needed to think about it.
- Hey, hey.

13:14.814 --> 13:16.606
Then talk to your mom.

13:16.616 --> 13:18.583
All right? Feel her out.
See what she thinks.

13:26.526 --> 13:29.385
- Well, hello there.
- Hello.

13:29.395 --> 13:31.588
You know, I was just thinking

13:31.598 --> 13:34.724
about what you said about your dad.

13:34.734 --> 13:36.801
You know, when you came out.

13:38.838 --> 13:41.539
I'm so sorry Frank treated you that way.

13:43.643 --> 13:45.702
You know, uh...

13:45.712 --> 13:47.704
when I found out Lena was gay,

13:47.714 --> 13:50.607
all I wanted to do was
to make sure she knew

13:50.617 --> 13:52.475
how much I still loved her.

13:52.485 --> 13:54.777
You know.

13:54.787 --> 13:56.479
Took some getting used to.

13:56.489 --> 13:58.456
I mean, it was such a surprise.

13:59.492 --> 14:01.351
But uh...

14:01.361 --> 14:02.593
she's my daughter.

14:04.597 --> 14:07.331
And I think of you as my daughter, too.

14:09.435 --> 14:11.594
And I'm so very proud of you.

14:16.376 --> 14:18.601
So, Mom, uh...

14:18.611 --> 14:20.837
there's something we wanted
to talk to you guys about.

14:20.847 --> 14:23.714
Uh... about the house.

14:25.451 --> 14:27.544
Um...

14:27.554 --> 14:29.646
We just...

14:29.656 --> 14:30.780
What I mean is...

14:30.790 --> 14:33.750
How are you guys doing financially?

14:33.760 --> 14:35.693
We're fine, honey.

14:36.713 --> 14:39.473
And I don't want you to worry,
because I have taken over the finances

14:39.499 --> 14:42.366
so there won't be any more surprises.

14:43.503 --> 14:46.396
But you know, I'm glad you...
You brought this up.

14:46.406 --> 14:49.432
Your father and I have been
talking about, well...

14:49.442 --> 14:51.801
the money that he loaned
you to buy the house.

14:51.811 --> 14:54.504
If we had that money in our account,

14:54.514 --> 14:55.772
it would be accruing interest.

14:55.782 --> 14:57.640
So, it only seems fair

14:57.650 --> 15:00.484
that you and Stef start
paying us back something.

15:01.654 --> 15:03.588
Whatever you think works.

15:05.458 --> 15:10.587
You... you want us to
pay you interest...

15:10.597 --> 15:13.389
on the loan for the house.

15:13.399 --> 15:14.799
Mm-hmm.

15:16.369 --> 15:17.560
<i>It was a gift!</i>

15:17.570 --> 15:19.629
It was never a loan.

15:19.639 --> 15:21.731
And... and now we're supposed
to pay interest on it?!

15:21.741 --> 15:23.700
Great!

15:23.710 --> 15:25.252
Hey, well, then... Then we're just...

15:25.263 --> 15:27.391
We're gonna have to put your
dad on the trust, then.

15:27.402 --> 15:29.606
Well, at least my mom's
taken over the finances,

15:29.616 --> 15:32.408
so we won't have to worry
about him being reckless.

15:32.418 --> 15:35.720
I-I will... I will talk
with Dean tomorrow.

15:38.524 --> 15:40.583
I just hope I don't end up in another

15:40.593 --> 15:42.585
awkward conversation with Tess.

15:42.595 --> 15:44.787
I got stuck there for,
like, half an hour today.

15:44.797 --> 15:46.589
Absolutely nothing to talk about.

15:46.599 --> 15:48.890
Why don't you talk about what
happened in high school?

15:48.901 --> 15:50.426
It's clearly still bothering you.

15:50.436 --> 15:53.596
Don't want to rehash old high school BS.

15:53.606 --> 15:55.798
It's just... I don't...
I... it's ridiculous.

15:55.808 --> 15:57.475
I'm not gonna do it.

16:03.078 --> 16:04.378
D arm there.

16:05.984 --> 16:07.442
What? Is that a surprise?

16:07.452 --> 16:09.244
Don't be sexist.

16:09.254 --> 16:11.079
So, is your girlfriend still mad at you?

16:11.089 --> 16:13.315
She's still not talking to me.

16:13.325 --> 16:15.384
Women, man. I mean...

16:15.394 --> 16:18.353
You take one selfie with a cute
girl at a party, then bam.

16:18.363 --> 16:19.963
Shut down!

16:21.199 --> 16:22.391
Ooh.

16:22.401 --> 16:24.426
I can, uh...

16:24.436 --> 16:26.328
help you with that.

16:26.338 --> 16:29.164
- You can?
- Yeah, of course.

16:29.174 --> 16:30.399
You just need a grand gesture.

16:30.409 --> 16:32.134
Girls live for that stuff.

16:32.144 --> 16:35.337
Okay... . but like what?

16:41.219 --> 16:43.253
So, uh, how are you?

16:44.489 --> 16:46.056
Fine. Everything's fine.

16:47.092 --> 16:48.543
You sure you're still not mad at me

16:48.554 --> 16:50.185
about the whole P-SAC,
free speech thing?

16:50.195 --> 16:51.486
No, no. It's not that.

16:51.496 --> 16:53.288
Just, um...

16:53.298 --> 16:56.291
I had, like, a lousy day yesterday.

16:56.301 --> 16:58.960
Um...

16:58.970 --> 17:03.198
Got, like, ripped apart
over my self-portrait.

17:03.208 --> 17:06.268
Someone said my piece didn't
know what it wanted to be,

17:06.278 --> 17:08.103
because I didn't.

17:08.113 --> 17:10.339
Maybe they're right. Um...

17:10.348 --> 17:12.307
You know, maybe...

17:12.317 --> 17:15.410
I don't have a voice as an artist.

17:15.420 --> 17:19.021
Maybe I don't have anything to say.

17:21.059 --> 17:24.319
Maybe I just rushed in
to taking this class

17:24.329 --> 17:26.253
to prove something to my moms.

17:26.263 --> 17:27.356
R-really? I don't...

17:27.366 --> 17:30.292
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

17:30.302 --> 17:33.228
I mean, we're on this beautiful hike.

17:33.238 --> 17:35.372
I just wanna enjoy the moment.

17:38.210 --> 17:40.268
So, who should we get
for our third player?

17:40.278 --> 17:43.405
- We could do a rando, or...
- Hey!

17:43.415 --> 17:47.075
I, uh... I thought we were hanging out.

17:47.085 --> 17:49.111
Um, later.

17:49.121 --> 17:50.874
I-I thought we were hanging out later.

17:50.885 --> 17:53.048
- You said 1:00.
- I-I swear I said 2:00.

17:53.058 --> 17:55.217
So, what, I'm just supposed to

17:55.227 --> 17:57.987
sit around and watch you
make out or whatever?

17:57.998 --> 17:59.604
Are you for real right now?

17:59.615 --> 18:01.354
Taylor, no. That... that's not what...

18:01.365 --> 18:03.258
I... Damn it, guys.

18:03.268 --> 18:05.427
Why do you keep putting me
in this terrible position?

18:05.437 --> 18:07.362
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

18:07.372 --> 18:10.098
Well, you can ask Noah
to leave for one thing,

18:10.108 --> 18:12.114
since I had to leave yesterday.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.379
Well, if you ask me to leave
then I'm never coming back.

18:15.113 --> 18:17.139
You know what?

18:17.149 --> 18:20.049
You can both leave and never come
back as far as I'm concerned.

18:26.458 --> 18:28.191
How many times do we have to do this?

18:29.327 --> 18:31.086
About 20 times for each letter.

18:31.096 --> 18:32.387
Twenty?

18:32.397 --> 18:34.122
Do you want to win her back or not?

18:34.132 --> 18:36.191
I'm not even sure this is gonna work.

18:36.201 --> 18:39.068
Trust me, I know what
girls want, so jump.

18:45.477 --> 18:47.202
Hello, darling.

18:47.212 --> 18:49.104
Hey, Grandma.

18:49.114 --> 18:50.439
What's the matter?

18:52.150 --> 18:54.376
My boyfriend and my best
friend are both upstairs,

18:54.386 --> 18:57.012
and they won't stop fighting over

18:57.022 --> 18:58.588
who gets to spend time with me.

18:58.599 --> 18:59.943
Aw.

18:59.954 --> 19:02.621
Must be hard to be so wanted.

19:03.995 --> 19:06.154
Come on, then.

19:06.164 --> 19:07.355
Grandma?

19:07.365 --> 19:09.257
G-Grandma, what are you doing?

19:09.267 --> 19:10.959
Well, I had to leave yesterday,

19:10.969 --> 19:12.716
so, it's only fair that
you leave this time.

19:12.727 --> 19:14.129
Okay, but he's my boyfriend.

19:14.139 --> 19:17.032
So, I understand you're having
a scheduling challenge.

19:17.042 --> 19:19.067
Now, I've seen many a
friend through a divorce,

19:19.077 --> 19:21.369
and even seen a few
custody battles in my day.

19:21.379 --> 19:23.104
I'm not their child, Grandma.

19:23.114 --> 19:24.815
No, of course not, but I've learned

19:24.826 --> 19:27.175
that the only way to navigate
this kind of problem

19:27.185 --> 19:29.344
is to have a firm schedule in place.

19:29.354 --> 19:33.348
- Okay.
- Now what I propose is this.

19:33.358 --> 19:35.383
You get Monday, Wednesday
and Friday of one week,

19:35.393 --> 19:37.219
and Tuesday and Thursday of the next.

19:37.229 --> 19:38.320
And you get the opposite.

19:38.330 --> 19:39.988
On Saturdays,

19:39.998 --> 19:42.057
you all hang out together.

19:42.067 --> 19:43.391
What about Sundays?

19:43.401 --> 19:46.194
On Sundays, you rest, my boy.
You're going to need it.

19:46.204 --> 19:48.129
Any questions, comments, concerns?

19:48.139 --> 19:49.372
No? Good.

19:58.416 --> 19:59.518
Whoa.

20:01.286 --> 20:03.078
Wow.

20:03.088 --> 20:05.013
That's pretty nice, huh?

20:05.023 --> 20:06.055
Yeah.

20:08.193 --> 20:09.351
You know, when I was young,

20:09.361 --> 20:12.487
I used to have dreams I could fly.

20:12.497 --> 20:15.390
Like all the time. It was awesome.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.367
You could do anything, go anywhere.

20:18.470 --> 20:21.263
I was completely free.

20:21.273 --> 20:23.498
Now, when I have a flying dream...

20:23.508 --> 20:25.500
I'm usually always running
away from something,

20:25.510 --> 20:28.244
or someone is trying to hold me down.

20:30.215 --> 20:31.592
I've never had a dream like that.

20:31.603 --> 20:33.182
Well, at least not that I can remember.

20:35.751 --> 20:38.348
What do you think's trying to
hold you down? In your dreams?

20:40.225 --> 20:43.251
Well, you know what Carl Jung says.

20:43.261 --> 20:45.153
"Everyone in your dreams is you," right?

20:56.474 --> 20:58.266
I don't want to toot my own horn,

20:58.276 --> 20:59.467
but I just may have negotiated

20:59.477 --> 21:02.178
the greatest peace
talks since Camp David.

21:04.149 --> 21:06.141
Uh, where... where's Daddy?

21:06.151 --> 21:08.043
He met an old friend for coffee.

21:08.053 --> 21:09.285
He should be here anytime.

21:11.323 --> 21:13.381
Um, so Dana, I guess, uh...

21:13.391 --> 21:15.116
I guess we need to talk about this,

21:15.126 --> 21:16.351
uh, this interest on the house.

21:16.361 --> 21:18.353
What exactly are you guys expecting?

21:18.363 --> 21:20.229
Whatever you think is fair.

21:22.033 --> 21:24.326
Okay, well, I-I don't know.

21:24.336 --> 21:27.362
Seeing as we always
thought that the money

21:27.372 --> 21:31.366
Stewart put in the house was
Lena's early inheritance.

21:31.376 --> 21:34.035
It... it's hard to say what's fair.

21:34.045 --> 21:37.105
Stef, I wasn't there,
so I don't know for sure

21:37.115 --> 21:39.040
the content of your
conversation with Stewart,

21:39.050 --> 21:42.177
but I do know he considers it a loan.

21:42.187 --> 21:45.447
Okay, here's how I know that
that wasn't the case, Dana.

21:45.457 --> 21:48.116
We wouldn't have bought the house.

21:48.126 --> 21:49.451
We... we never could have afforded

21:49.461 --> 21:51.319
to pay back you and the bank,

21:51.329 --> 21:53.221
and... and...

21:53.231 --> 21:54.422
To be honest,

21:54.432 --> 21:57.392
I, uh, I don't think that
Stewart's memory is what it was.

21:57.402 --> 22:00.103
- Stef.
- What exactly are you implying?

22:02.240 --> 22:05.200
Nothing. How... how about this?

22:05.210 --> 22:08.236
How about...

22:08.246 --> 22:10.346
How about we, uh, we draw
up something with a lawyer?

22:11.383 --> 22:13.341
To arrange for a repayment plan.

22:13.351 --> 22:15.210
Interest for now,

22:15.220 --> 22:17.345
and when we sell, the loan in full.

22:17.355 --> 22:19.155
In exchange...

22:21.026 --> 22:23.192
we would like to take
Stewart off the title.

22:25.063 --> 22:28.197
Dana, we cannot risk another lien.

22:29.501 --> 22:31.393
Well...

22:31.403 --> 22:34.103
um, I don't know, uh...

22:36.241 --> 22:38.333
I have to discuss this with your father.

22:38.343 --> 22:41.010
Anybody home?

22:42.147 --> 22:44.305
Hi. Where are the kids?

22:44.315 --> 22:46.249
Come out! I wanna show you something.

22:50.321 --> 22:51.599
What do ya think?

22:51.606 --> 22:52.756
I got it for

22:52.763 --> 22:55.116
the kids so that they wouldn't
have to bicker all the time.

22:55.126 --> 22:56.351
You got us a car?!

22:58.096 --> 22:59.328
Thank you.

23:00.365 --> 23:02.257
Daddy, we can't accept this.

23:02.267 --> 23:04.359
Why not? You took a car from Frank.

23:04.369 --> 23:06.194
Because we can't afford to pay for it.

23:06.204 --> 23:08.096
We're barely making ends meet as it is.

23:08.106 --> 23:10.265
Oh, don't worry. I'm making good money.

23:10.275 --> 23:12.467
And that bonus is coming in.

23:12.477 --> 23:14.110
No, it's not.

23:15.213 --> 23:17.080
You're retired, love.

23:30.139 --> 23:31.430
Okay, whoa. Easy.

23:33.242 --> 23:35.075
Ah!

23:36.842 --> 23:39.802
Wow. I... You...

23:39.812 --> 23:42.037
Your mom was right. This is...

23:42.047 --> 23:44.848
about the most beautiful
place I've ever seen.

23:49.615 --> 23:50.819
What?

23:54.159 --> 23:55.184
Oh.

23:55.910 --> 23:59.670
- Wait. Are you serious?
- Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.824
- You really wanna do this?
- Yeah.

24:02.166 --> 24:03.324
I...

24:03.334 --> 24:06.260
Um...

24:06.270 --> 24:08.129
It just looks a little...

24:08.139 --> 24:10.398
- Cold. No, I...
- Amazing?

24:10.408 --> 24:13.201
Um...

24:13.211 --> 24:15.177
Oh.

24:16.414 --> 24:18.214
You coming?

24:20.756 --> 24:21.923
Yeah.

24:23.187 --> 24:24.278
Hurry!

24:24.288 --> 24:27.123
- It's cold!
- Okay. I'm coming.

24:48.446 --> 24:50.079
Oh, my god!

24:59.323 --> 25:02.016
We need to get Stewart's
name off the title.

25:02.026 --> 25:04.293
We'll sign whatever you need.

25:05.329 --> 25:06.929
We can...

25:08.099 --> 25:10.424
We... we can pay back
the money with interest.

25:10.434 --> 25:13.068
No. You shouldn't have to do that.

25:14.272 --> 25:16.063
Knowing my husband,

25:16.073 --> 25:18.299
I'm sure that, at the very least,

25:18.309 --> 25:20.401
things were vague.

25:20.411 --> 25:23.337
Still. You're... you're
probably gonna need money.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.247
You know, for care, for him.

25:27.051 --> 25:30.286
We... Please. We want
to help. Please let us.

25:35.426 --> 25:36.992
Thank you.

25:43.434 --> 25:45.434
How long has this been going on, Mom?

25:48.372 --> 25:50.206
About a year or so.

25:53.211 --> 25:54.235
There's just some things

25:54.245 --> 25:56.204
you don't want to talk about, you know.

25:56.214 --> 25:57.246
Just...

25:58.349 --> 26:00.115
doesn't make them go away.

26:04.956 --> 26:08.123
I am so not ready for this.

26:10.428 --> 26:12.294
I'm not ready to lose him.

26:25.243 --> 26:26.868
They came to get the car?

26:26.879 --> 26:27.977
Yeah.

26:29.247 --> 26:32.106
- Sorry we couldn't keep it, Dad.
- Yeah.

26:32.116 --> 26:33.415
Come, sit.

26:35.019 --> 26:37.319
Something's been bothering me.

26:38.456 --> 26:41.282
You remember when you came out,

26:41.292 --> 26:43.284
and I said, "I still love you."

26:43.294 --> 26:45.052
- Yeah?
- Yeah, that was terrible.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.255
That was a terrible thing to say.

26:47.265 --> 26:49.223
- But...
- Well, I mean...

26:49.233 --> 26:51.325
"Still love you." What is that?

26:51.335 --> 26:54.462
I still love you in spite
of the fact you're gay?

26:54.472 --> 26:57.306
What... That's just wrong.

26:58.976 --> 27:02.136
I mean, my love for
you has never changed.

27:02.146 --> 27:04.171
Not one bit.

27:04.181 --> 27:06.307
And what I should've said was,

27:06.317 --> 27:08.918
"I'm very proud you know who you are.

27:10.021 --> 27:12.013
"And I can't wait to meet the person

27:12.023 --> 27:14.156
you choose to share your life with."

27:17.161 --> 27:19.253
You remember when I was little?

27:19.263 --> 27:22.056
How you would... how you would
sit and watch cartoons with me?

27:23.434 --> 27:25.026
Yeah.

27:25.036 --> 27:27.995
Every morning. No matter how
badly you needed to get to work.

27:28.005 --> 27:29.171
That was our time.

27:30.408 --> 27:32.166
And now that I have, uh, a job,

27:32.176 --> 27:34.201
and I have kids of my own...

27:34.211 --> 27:36.979
I can't help but think how
hard that must have been.

27:38.449 --> 27:40.316
Thank you for that.

27:42.186 --> 27:44.412
And you know, for just...

27:44.422 --> 27:46.956
being a really good dad.

27:59.998 --> 28:01.407
Whoa. Come on.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.264
You should be more careful with these.

28:03.274 --> 28:05.068
Someone could get hurt, like Mason.

28:05.079 --> 28:06.764
- Sorry.
- Listen.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.871
About the other night, I...

28:10.348 --> 28:13.040
I mean, I-I didn't know you
still had feelings for Cort.

28:13.050 --> 28:14.208
No, I don't, I don't.

28:14.218 --> 28:16.310
It's not that, okay? I just...

28:16.320 --> 28:17.411
And be more careful,

28:17.421 --> 28:19.146
or otherwise Mason's gonna end up

28:19.156 --> 28:21.082
with a nail in his head like Jesus.

28:21.092 --> 28:23.354
It's dangerous with all this
shit lying around here.

28:24.095 --> 28:25.286
Hey.

28:25.296 --> 28:26.555
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

28:26.566 --> 28:28.189
Seems that Brandon here is a little mad.

28:28.199 --> 28:29.390
What? No! I told you!

28:29.400 --> 28:31.258
I'm fine! It's fine! Okay?

28:31.268 --> 28:34.061
It's whatever. Cortney,
do whatever you want.

28:34.071 --> 28:36.097
Fall in love, get married,
have another baby.

28:36.107 --> 28:37.172
Why not?

28:44.547 --> 28:45.772
So...

28:45.782 --> 28:47.615
you really think you
don't know who you are?

28:48.818 --> 28:51.519
Because I don't, like, at all.

28:52.589 --> 28:54.614
I see someone who...

28:54.624 --> 28:56.549
ferociously knows who she is,

28:56.559 --> 28:57.651
and what she believes.

28:57.661 --> 28:59.786
I mean, seriously. Think about it.

28:59.796 --> 29:03.390
When you're fighting for
someone else, like Kyle.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.366
I mean, you never waver.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.636
So, why can't you find
that belief in yourself?

29:11.341 --> 29:13.408
Um, I don't know.

29:15.378 --> 29:19.406
I'm not like you.
You're so sure of yourself.

29:19.416 --> 29:21.474
I just keep thinking that
I should know everything.

29:21.484 --> 29:24.115
Who I am, what I want,
what life's supposed to be like,

29:24.126 --> 29:25.821
and it's just making
me crazy that I don't.

29:25.832 --> 29:28.448
And so, when someone
doubts me, I just crumble.

29:28.458 --> 29:29.557
Hey.

29:32.429 --> 29:33.520
I get it.

29:33.530 --> 29:36.531
But the truth is...

29:37.701 --> 29:39.726
no one knows the entirety
of who they are.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.769
And if they say they do,

29:42.806 --> 29:45.398
they're either lying

29:45.408 --> 29:47.775
or really, really lame.

29:57.787 --> 29:59.846
I guess...

29:59.856 --> 30:03.783
all I need to know today is...

30:03.793 --> 30:07.628
who I am and what I want right now.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.508
What I want right now is this.

30:21.845 --> 30:23.678
Me too.

30:33.656 --> 30:35.523
Maybe we should go back to your place.

30:45.835 --> 30:47.794
<i>You make me fly, baby.</i>

30:47.804 --> 30:48.895
<i>You're the only one for me.</i>

30:48.905 --> 30:51.431
That looks pretty cool.

30:51.441 --> 30:53.500
Told ya. Upload that to your Insta,

30:53.511 --> 30:57.379
and she'll be calling you before she
even finishes watching it. Trust.

31:03.185 --> 31:04.677
I was coming out here to say sorry.

31:04.687 --> 31:05.812
Please don't go.

31:05.822 --> 31:07.747
I should. It's for the best.

31:07.757 --> 31:09.749
Your family's been more than generous.

31:09.759 --> 31:12.418
Cort, your place isn't
ready till next week.

31:12.428 --> 31:15.622
Look, the truth is, I...

31:15.632 --> 31:17.590
I was caught off-guard
seeing you with Gabe.

31:17.600 --> 31:21.528
Okay? I didn't know what
to think or how to feel.

31:21.538 --> 31:22.603
I still don't. I...

31:24.541 --> 31:26.466
You know, I get it.

31:26.476 --> 31:29.669
Seeing you with Grace was
definitely weird for me, too.

31:29.679 --> 31:33.540
And I started freaking out
about it, and then I realized,

31:33.550 --> 31:36.609
isn't that just normal?

31:36.619 --> 31:39.612
To feel a little bit jealous
when your ex moves on?

31:39.622 --> 31:43.583
Really, does it have to mean
anything more than that?

31:43.593 --> 31:48.454
It's not like it means you and
I want to get back together.

31:48.464 --> 31:49.764
Right? Or that we should?

31:51.601 --> 31:53.734
What I finally figured out is...

31:55.438 --> 31:56.896
I just want you to be happy.

31:56.906 --> 31:59.833
Well, me... me too.

31:59.843 --> 32:02.535
I mean it.

32:02.545 --> 32:05.580
You should... kiss whoever you want.

32:07.851 --> 32:11.611
But I do think I have to go.

32:11.621 --> 32:14.388
Honestly, I shouldn't be
kissing anyone right now.

32:15.692 --> 32:17.684
I should be focused on my kid,

32:17.694 --> 32:19.485
and being a good mom,

32:19.495 --> 32:22.830
and getting my life together.

32:24.767 --> 32:27.594
But thank you.

32:27.604 --> 32:29.537
Really, for everything.

32:31.474 --> 32:33.741
You're a good man, Brandon Foster.

32:43.102 --> 32:44.122
Found 'em!

32:44.133 --> 32:46.713
Oh, well, looks like the time has come.

32:46.723 --> 32:49.624
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, sweet pea.

32:50.660 --> 32:52.418
See you soon, okay?

32:52.428 --> 32:54.687
We'll watch some cartoons
for old times' sake.

32:54.697 --> 32:56.697
Hmm?

33:03.706 --> 33:05.740
Here. Take these. Hey.

33:08.845 --> 33:10.745
Is Grandpa all right?

33:11.781 --> 33:13.740
We don't know, love.

33:13.750 --> 33:15.583
But we're gonna find out, all right?

33:19.622 --> 33:20.688
You okay?

33:23.526 --> 33:26.528
You just never think it's gonna
happen to your parents, you know.

33:43.265 --> 33:47.159
So, we didn't, um,
just drift apart in high school,

33:47.169 --> 33:50.262
and I didn't dump you because
I... I got new friends.

33:50.272 --> 33:52.898
Um, I...

33:52.908 --> 33:55.075
I had feelings for you.
Romantic feelings.

33:56.536 --> 33:58.270
And I don't know if you remember this,

33:58.280 --> 34:00.105
um, maybe you do, maybe you don't.

34:00.115 --> 34:03.275
That time that my father caught us

34:03.285 --> 34:06.011
cuddling on the couch.

34:06.021 --> 34:08.280
Do you... yeah? Uh...

34:08.290 --> 34:11.917
Well, he sent me to our church.

34:11.927 --> 34:14.119
Talked to the youth minister.

34:14.129 --> 34:16.021
Get my head on straight, so to speak.

34:16.031 --> 34:18.857
And um, after that,

34:18.867 --> 34:21.935
maybe I was just
embarrassed and ashamed.

34:23.237 --> 34:26.072
I didn't know what else to do,
but to distance myself.

34:27.943 --> 34:32.170
Okay, if you had those
feelings back in high school,

34:32.181 --> 34:33.914
why did you marry Mike?

34:36.083 --> 34:38.051
I guess because I thought
I was supposed to.

34:39.922 --> 34:42.214
And you know, I'm happy with
the way things are now,

34:42.224 --> 34:44.925
but I-I know that I caused
Mike a lot of pain.

34:46.094 --> 34:48.253
And I-I'm afraid that I hurt you too,

34:48.263 --> 34:50.931
and for that I want to apologize.

34:53.936 --> 34:55.226
I was.

34:55.237 --> 34:58.772
I was hurt when you suddenly cut me out.

34:59.808 --> 35:01.388
But you know what,
it was a long time ago.

35:01.399 --> 35:03.235
And honestly, it wasn't that big a deal.

35:03.245 --> 35:06.146
I mean, it's not like I had those
feelings for you, so, you know.

35:07.249 --> 35:08.915
Yeah, of course.

35:10.052 --> 35:11.084
Good.

35:47.155 --> 35:48.981
- Wait.
- Is everything okay?

35:48.991 --> 35:50.924
Yeah. Just one second.

35:57.232 --> 36:01.193
<i>♪ All that I think about ♪</i>

36:01.203 --> 36:03.962

36:31.300 --> 36:33.926
- Yeah?
- Hey.

36:33.936 --> 36:36.061
So, um, I've been thinking.

36:36.071 --> 36:39.940
You should, uh, you should throw
your dad's engagement party here.

36:41.977 --> 36:45.170
Really? Um, I mean,
are you sure about that?

36:45.180 --> 36:48.206
Yeah, I'm happy he's found someone.

36:48.216 --> 36:50.884
And it's the least I can do.

36:58.096 --> 37:00.853
No, no, no. Whenever you call me,
we always get into a fight.

37:00.860 --> 37:03.318
That's why I never wanna
answer your phone calls.

37:03.832 --> 37:05.369
No! No, I'm fine.

37:05.380 --> 37:06.991
No, you do not need to come to...

37:07.002 --> 37:09.051
Hold on, let me call you back.
Someone's at my door.

37:10.272 --> 37:11.771
Oh.

37:14.209 --> 37:16.268
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:16.278 --> 37:18.103
Uh, everything okay?

37:18.113 --> 37:22.174
Yeah, just my mom doing her
overprotective thing again.

37:22.184 --> 37:24.076
Uh, what are you doing here?

37:24.086 --> 37:27.079
Uh, nothing, nothing. I just, you know,

37:27.089 --> 37:30.223
thought of you and
wanted to give you this.

37:38.100 --> 37:40.859
Choc-olatte! This is my favorite.

37:40.869 --> 37:42.002
I know.

37:49.044 --> 37:51.236
So, it worked.

37:51.246 --> 37:52.369
- It did?
- Yeah.

37:52.380 --> 37:53.939
I just got off the phone with her.

37:53.949 --> 37:55.140
She was, like, totally crying.

37:55.150 --> 37:57.809
Oh my God, yay!

37:57.819 --> 37:59.845
Well, thank you.

37:59.855 --> 38:00.987
You're a good friend.

38:02.224 --> 38:04.950
Uh, so listen...

38:04.960 --> 38:07.819
do you have any plans next Saturday?

38:07.829 --> 38:10.938
It's prom, and I'm going with
a group of friends, and...

38:10.949 --> 38:13.892
I was thinking, you know, since you
don't really know that many people,

38:13.902 --> 38:15.927
maybe you'd wanna come with us?

38:15.937 --> 38:17.129
Yeah, that sounds great,

38:17.139 --> 38:20.966
but, um, Olivia's actually
here that weekend.

38:20.976 --> 38:23.243
So, maybe, we could, like, all go?

38:25.180 --> 38:28.206
Yeah! I do think...

38:28.216 --> 38:30.175
- we could all go.
- Yeah?

38:30.185 --> 38:31.276
Yeah, that'd be fun.

38:31.286 --> 38:34.087
Sweet! All right, see ya.

38:50.648 --> 38:51.788
_

39:07.122 --> 39:08.257
Wha... ?

39:09.191 --> 39:10.757
Oh my...

39:17.099 --> 39:19.024
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Oh my god!

39:19.034 --> 39:20.892
You're never gonna believe this.

39:20.902 --> 39:23.795
We just got an invite from this
NEW GAME: "Eminent Power."

39:23.805 --> 39:26.798
They want us to be, like,
ambassadors, or influencers,

39:26.808 --> 39:28.166
or whatever for them.

39:28.176 --> 39:31.236
They saw our videos and they
want to pay us to play the game.

39:31.246 --> 39:33.038
<i>So... so what do we have to do?</i>

39:33.048 --> 39:34.372
Uh, it says, uh,

39:34.382 --> 39:36.975
uh, I just, I'm supposed to
call them if we're interested.

39:36.985 --> 39:38.910
And... and we are right? We're...

39:38.920 --> 39:40.145
<i>Um, yeah.</i>

39:40.155 --> 39:42.948
O-Okay. Okay, let me call them,

39:42.958 --> 39:44.791
and then I... I'll call you back.

39:51.833 --> 39:53.925
<i>- Wade Richards.</i>
- Uh, yeah, uh, yeah!

39:53.935 --> 39:55.827
My name is Jude Adams-Foster.

39:55.837 --> 39:58.490
I got an email asking if we want
to be ambassadors for you guys,

39:58.501 --> 40:00.098
and the answer is yes.

40:00.108 --> 40:02.067
Duh!

40:02.077 --> 40:03.902
<i>Uh, "we" who?</i>

40:03.912 --> 40:05.270
Uh, me and my friend, Taylor.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.305
GIRLandGAYGUY. That... that's us.

40:07.315 --> 40:09.040
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

40:09.050 --> 40:10.308
<i>Uh, your friend is great.</i>

40:10.318 --> 40:12.051
<i>Uh, but this...
This doesn't apply to her.</i>

40:13.188 --> 40:14.808
<i>We already have plenty of girl gamers,</i>

40:14.819 --> 40:16.281
<i>we're just looking for some gaymers.</i>

40:16.291 --> 40:19.851
<i>You know, "g-a-y mers."</i>

40:19.861 --> 40:21.961
<i>Wait, you didn't tell
your friend, did you?</i>

40:23.696 --> 40:26.522
Does anybody have any questions,

40:26.533 --> 40:28.525
or anything they'd like to share?

40:28.536 --> 40:30.181
Yeah, um...

40:30.983 --> 40:34.009
I just, uh, wanted to say...

40:34.019 --> 40:38.113
sorry if I seemed a little
defensive the other day.

40:38.123 --> 40:40.749
Um...

40:40.759 --> 40:43.852
See, here's the thing.
I was a foster kid.

40:43.862 --> 40:47.022
So, I've been so many different girls,

40:47.032 --> 40:49.058
and been in so many different homes.

40:49.068 --> 40:50.959
Um...

40:50.969 --> 40:53.228
And the truth is, I...

40:53.238 --> 40:55.772
don't know who I am.

40:56.809 --> 40:58.809
But I'm okay with that.

41:00.713 --> 41:04.106
So, this self-portrait,
my self-portrait,

41:04.116 --> 41:06.141
it's exactly right.

41:06.151 --> 41:09.686
It's exactly how I see myself now.

41:10.956 --> 41:12.981
So I think it's the perfect piece

41:12.991 --> 41:14.825
to put in my portfolio.
