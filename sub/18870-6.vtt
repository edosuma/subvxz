00:01.067 --> 00:03.103
<i>Previously on "Being Mary Jane"...</i>

00:03.169 --> 00:05.638
Everyone wants me to talk
about what happened, again.

00:05.705 --> 00:08.141
That cop going back to work
is all over the news now,

00:08.208 --> 00:10.009
but it's gonna die down.

00:10.076 --> 00:12.645
Treyvion has nightmares.
I'm ready for it to be over.

00:12.712 --> 00:17.517
<i>Your pose with Orlando Lagos was so cool.
I showed it to everyone at school.</i>

00:17.584 --> 00:19.753
<i>- Really?
- He's one of our favorite players.</i>

00:19.819 --> 00:21.020
<i>How do you know him?</i>

00:21.087 --> 00:22.589
He's just a friend.

00:22.655 --> 00:24.557
- Why don't you just admit it?
- Admit what?

00:24.624 --> 00:26.626
That this is all a lie, Dante!

00:26.693 --> 00:29.496
You used me. It's gone, Dante.

00:29.562 --> 00:32.899
- The money. I had to give it back.
- What do you mean you gave it back?

00:32.966 --> 00:37.670
Congratulations.
You're about to celebrate your 40th.

00:37.737 --> 00:40.874
It looks like you might
be in a real relationship.

00:40.940 --> 00:42.208
What?

00:48.014 --> 00:50.917
The northeast states are in a deep freeze
following 3 days

00:50.984 --> 00:52.986
of record-breaking low temperatures.

00:53.052 --> 00:56.756
We have full coverage. But first,
let's check in with Mary Jane Paul

00:56.823 --> 00:59.559
who's outside with fans braving the cold.

00:59.626 --> 01:00.660
Mary Jane?

01:00.727 --> 01:03.129
The crowd outside
is a bit thinner than usual.

01:03.196 --> 01:06.132
But I've been joined by a group
of some very daring young men

01:06.199 --> 01:07.901
who don't mind the cold.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.904
Tell us where you're from,
and why you're dressed like this.

01:10.970 --> 01:14.073
We study at New York City University
and we're from Canada.

01:14.140 --> 01:16.009
For Canuks this is beach weather.

01:17.043 --> 01:18.711
Well, there you have it, America.

01:18.778 --> 01:21.848
According to these guys,
we should all be out here in our bikinis.

01:24.117 --> 01:26.953
Live from outside the newsroom
of "Great Day USA,"

01:27.020 --> 01:30.890
I'm Mary Jane Paul.
Ronda, Aaron, back to you.

01:31.558 --> 01:34.461
Which one of you
no-home-training clowns threw it?

01:34.527 --> 01:36.863
<i>- Who threw it?
- Mary Jane. Inside now, please.</i>

01:37.897 --> 01:41.835
Mary Jane, you cannot lose your cool
every time some idiot catcalls you.

01:41.901 --> 01:45.071
That wasn't a catcall. That was assault.
And I'm pressing charges.

01:45.138 --> 01:47.140
It was a freaking snowball
and you know what?

01:47.207 --> 01:49.909
It was funny and it'll probably make
the year-end bloopers.

01:49.976 --> 01:52.745
- Hopefully, even TMZ, if we're lucky.
- And that's good.

01:52.812 --> 01:56.483
Anything that ingratiates you
with the audience is a good thing, yes.

01:56.549 --> 01:58.852
Sorry, I think I have
seasonal affective disorder.

01:58.918 --> 02:02.021
Well, I've got
the perfect remedy for that.

02:02.088 --> 02:04.090
This year marks the 50th anniversary

02:04.157 --> 02:07.360
of Thurgood Marshall's confirmation
to the Supreme Court,

02:07.427 --> 02:10.630
and the Racial Justice Coalition
is throwing a huge gala,

02:10.697 --> 02:13.466
and I got Garrett to send us
to Atlanta to cover it.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.636
It sounds like a gig
with Ronda's name written over it.

02:16.703 --> 02:19.172
Forget about Ronda,
Aaron's on vacation next week,

02:19.239 --> 02:21.808
so, if Ronda's in Atlanta...

02:21.875 --> 02:23.376
I'd get to sit in the anchor chair.

02:23.443 --> 02:26.646
Exactly. And you know Ronda
won't let that happen without a fight.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.348
Let's look on the bright side.

02:28.948 --> 02:31.584
Here we come, Atlanta! Hello? Hello?

02:31.651 --> 02:34.220
- Wait.
- What?

02:34.287 --> 02:35.722
We have to start researching.

02:35.788 --> 02:39.058
There'll be a ton of civil rights leaders
there, the mayor of Atlanta.

02:39.125 --> 02:40.426
Done.

02:43.730 --> 02:46.332
And this is why
you're the best producer in the game.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.803
Tell me, bitch, how did you get Garrett
to let you go instead of Justin?

02:50.870 --> 02:53.039
Well, I was on my way to Atlanta anyway

02:53.106 --> 02:56.576
to go and see the boys, and since
I have started working with Orlando,

02:56.643 --> 03:00.179
I have finally cracked
that damn office boys' club.

03:00.246 --> 03:02.815
- It's a beautiful thing.
- Working with Orlando.

03:02.882 --> 03:04.884
Is that what we're calling it these days?

03:04.951 --> 03:06.920
<i>We fly in the morning, chica. Be ready.</i>

03:14.694 --> 03:16.229
Hello?

03:18.431 --> 03:19.632
Anybody home?

03:19.699 --> 03:21.834
- Hey! It is you!
- Hey!

03:22.869 --> 03:24.237
How are you?

03:25.305 --> 03:28.508
- My goodness.
- Hi, Mom.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.577
A sight for sore eyes.

03:30.643 --> 03:31.978
- Hey, sis.
- Hey, how are you?

03:33.179 --> 03:35.214
- You still with that job?
- Yeah, yeah.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.584
- Where's the show putting you up now?
- Four Seasons.

03:39.252 --> 03:41.487
"Great Day USA" does not play.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.423
- Auntie!
- Hey!

03:43.489 --> 03:44.958
- Hi, baby.
- Hi!

03:45.024 --> 03:48.661
You look so good! I'm sorry
to run off as soon as you get here,

03:48.728 --> 03:50.229
but I've gotta go get Treyvion.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.799
- Okay.
- It's not time yet. School's not out.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.434
Yeah, he had a little incident.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.770
- He bit some kid.
- He's overtired. That's why he acts out.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.238
Is he still having nightmares?

03:59.305 --> 04:01.107
Almost every night. It's crazy.

04:01.174 --> 04:04.344
Maybe I can just stay here and that way
I can help with Treyvion.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.913
- You'd do that?
- Of course. It's only a couple of days.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.683
- I'll get your room ready.
- Thanks, Mom.

04:10.750 --> 04:14.621
<i>- You settling in okay?
- Yeah. Sure.</i>

04:16.289 --> 04:19.258
<i>Do I detect the slightest bit
of trepidation?</i>

04:20.360 --> 04:23.730
<i>Babe, you were looking forward
to this trip. You were over the moon.</i>

04:23.796 --> 04:28.267
No, I still am. It's just...
being back at home in my old room...

04:28.968 --> 04:31.638
I'm sort of afraid of falling back
into old habits.

04:32.071 --> 04:36.109
<i>Yeah, the binge drinking
and the chain smoking.</i>

04:36.175 --> 04:39.212
No, more like meddling and judging.

04:39.278 --> 04:41.280
Things my family brings out of me.

04:41.347 --> 04:42.982
<i>Look babe, everyone</i>

04:43.049 --> 04:45.918
<i>reverts to their 15-year-old self
when they're around family.</i>

04:45.985 --> 04:47.587
Nope, not gonna let that happen.

04:47.654 --> 04:49.989
<i>You can't control everything, MJ.</i>

04:50.056 --> 04:53.426
<i>There may be something unexpected
coming your way.</i>

04:54.127 --> 04:56.429
God, I hope not. I detest surprises.

04:58.097 --> 04:59.265
Anybody gonna get that?

05:00.800 --> 05:02.068
Hold on.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.640
Surprise.

05:26.025 --> 05:28.594
I can't believe you flew
all this way to surprise me.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.164
It's no big deal.
My agent booked a last-minute gig

05:31.230 --> 05:32.965
and since you were here...

05:33.032 --> 05:35.201
I wish you told me
before I gave up my hotel.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.803
Yes, I'm still here.

05:38.404 --> 05:39.906
Okay, thank you.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.509
- No luck.
- There's three conventions in town.

05:43.576 --> 05:46.913
So, unless you wanna stay
at a roach-infested no-tell motel,

05:46.979 --> 05:48.147
you've gotta bunk here.

05:48.214 --> 05:50.883
Sex in your parents' house. Taboo.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.885
I like that.

05:57.557 --> 05:58.991
Hey.

05:59.058 --> 06:02.562
- Pauletta, who is this young man?
- I'm just the delivery guy.

06:02.628 --> 06:05.231
- She was giving me my tip.
- He's kidding.

06:05.298 --> 06:08.067
This is Lee
and he flew down to surprise me.

06:08.134 --> 06:11.137
How are you, young man?
I'm Pauletta's father, Paul Patterson.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.906
- This is my wife, Helen.
- Such a pleasure to meet you both.

06:13.973 --> 06:16.609
You flew all this way
to surprise my daughter?

06:16.676 --> 06:19.345
- It sounds serious.
- No, Mom.

06:19.412 --> 06:22.248
And where are you staying
while you're here, Mr. Lee?

06:22.315 --> 06:25.518
- In the guest room with me?
- Nice try, little Pauletta.

06:25.585 --> 06:29.322
The guest bedroom has a leak
and your father's patching it.

06:29.388 --> 06:32.959
Mr. Lee, you stay down here
in the family room,

06:33.025 --> 06:36.562
and you can stay with Treyvion.
He'll love that.

06:36.629 --> 06:38.598
Bring this young man into the kitchen

06:38.664 --> 06:41.300
so I can get to know him
while I'm cooking.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.537
- Pauletta?
- Yeah, I'll explain later.

06:44.604 --> 06:46.472
So, how did you two meet?

06:46.539 --> 06:48.908
At a comedy club in Manhattan.
I was performing...

06:48.975 --> 06:51.544
Yeah, Lee's a stand up comedian.
He's really funny.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.480
Why I ain't laughed yet?

06:54.547 --> 06:58.484
I was performing when I saw
this radiant woman sat at the bar.

06:58.551 --> 07:01.120
Of course, she shot me down
at the first approach.

07:01.187 --> 07:03.022
You don't have to tell us that.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.191
There's nothing wrong with being picky.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.927
My aunt is too successful
to end up with any old riffraff.

07:07.994 --> 07:12.031
Well, I'm glad you were persistent,
but she can be a little stubborn.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.400
You seem to have
the temperament to handle her.

07:14.467 --> 07:15.868
I'm not that stubborn.

07:15.935 --> 07:19.639
Lee, sweetie, have you had enough?
Would you like another helping?

07:19.705 --> 07:21.507
Well, what's this?

07:21.574 --> 07:25.812
That's hog's head cheese.
As disgusting as the name suggests.

07:25.878 --> 07:28.815
They tried to get us to eat that
as kids. We wouldn't go near it.

07:28.881 --> 07:32.351
Yeah, Granddad tricked me
into eating some when I was little.

07:32.418 --> 07:35.054
I was so sick. I can still taste it.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.522
Come on, cut me up a slice.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.024
- Okay.
- Don't do it.

07:38.090 --> 07:40.026
It can't be that bad. It looks like pâté.

07:46.933 --> 07:48.935
What's in this hog's head cheese?

07:49.001 --> 07:50.903
Nothing that actually resembles cheese.

07:50.970 --> 07:54.273
It's more of a jelly
made from the meat of a hog's head.

07:54.340 --> 07:55.575
That ain't all.

07:55.641 --> 07:59.045
The hog's feet, the hog's heart,
and the hog's tongue.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.484
- My compliments to you, Mrs. Patterson.
- Actually, it's Paul's specialty.

08:05.551 --> 08:08.621
Yep, my grandfather
taught me how to make it.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.256
It's a Southern delicacy.

08:10.323 --> 08:15.127
Unfortunately, our saditty children
are too good to enjoy

08:15.194 --> 08:17.463
the food of our ancestors.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.398
Saditty? What does that mean?

08:19.465 --> 08:22.401
All right, guys, well,
I'm gonna let you all teach Lee here

08:22.468 --> 08:25.004
all about slave cuisine
and Southern slang

08:25.071 --> 08:28.941
while I go get my press credentials.
Or maybe you should come with me.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.743
He's in good hands.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.144
Bye. Go on.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.649
So, saditty?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.388
Great.

08:43.522 --> 08:45.258
Hey, Mary Jane!

08:45.324 --> 08:47.426
I got your credentials ready, mama.

08:47.493 --> 08:49.128
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.097
Here you go. Look who's here.

08:51.163 --> 08:54.967
- Scott, Max, come here.
- My God. Hi!

08:55.034 --> 08:56.669
- I know, right?
- Look at you.

08:56.736 --> 08:59.272
- What's up?
- How are you?

08:59.338 --> 09:01.073
Look how grown you two have gotten.

09:01.140 --> 09:04.176
Why don't you go check out
the refreshment table, grab your stuff,

09:04.243 --> 09:05.711
and can you get me a lemonade?

09:05.778 --> 09:07.380
- Okay.
- All right? Say goodbye.

09:07.446 --> 09:08.881
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:08.948 --> 09:12.618
- Max is officially a grown man.
- Yeah, and that man is having sex.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.620
I'm about to have the talk with him.

09:14.687 --> 09:17.556
If he's already having sex,
isn't it late to have a talk with him?

09:17.623 --> 09:20.226
No, no, not the birds and the bees talk.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.161
The don't knock anybody up talk.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.030
I thought I at least had one more year.

09:24.096 --> 09:25.731
- I can't believe it.
- It'll be okay.

09:25.798 --> 09:27.833
Let's strategize later.
I'll get them home.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.002
- I'll be right back.
- Just wrap him in a condom.

09:30.069 --> 09:33.406
- Mary Jane.
- My goodness.

09:33.472 --> 09:36.075
Vladimir Fredrick, how are you?

09:36.142 --> 09:37.476
Good. You?

09:38.277 --> 09:42.515
Sophia! Hi, how are you?
And Luke. My goodness.

09:42.581 --> 09:46.052
- Mary Jane, back from the Big Apple.
- You know...

09:46.118 --> 09:47.720
Tell us all about "Great Day USA."

09:47.787 --> 09:50.589
Is that Aaron as hot in person
as he is on screen?

09:50.656 --> 09:54.660
Okay, the show is amazing and yes,
Aaron is equally as hot in person.

09:54.727 --> 09:58.397
- I'm having the time of my life.
- It sure looks like it.

09:58.464 --> 10:01.267
Your wardrobe budget
must be, what, astronomical?

10:01.334 --> 10:04.470
Girl, those designers
give us all that stuff for free.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.772
No, I so hate you. I hate her right now.

10:06.839 --> 10:09.375
Show us some pics of little Carlo
so I can hate on you, too.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.477
I have had two more since you left.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.413
- What?
- Twins. Elaina and Amelia.

10:15.414 --> 10:17.383
They're so cute. How do you do it?

10:17.450 --> 10:21.087
I'm weekend anchor now.
With three kids, something had to go.

10:21.153 --> 10:23.089
What's the biggest change you did for TV?

10:23.155 --> 10:27.126
Probably forging a deeper connection
to the sunnier side of my disposition.

10:27.193 --> 10:30.763
- Well, that can't be easy for you.
- Vlad, as charming as ever.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.999
Are you still the man
over at "Today's Top News"?

10:33.065 --> 10:36.268
Ten years in September
and, it's not public yet,

10:36.335 --> 10:38.371
but I've been promoted. Evening anchor.

10:38.437 --> 10:40.606
- What?
- You got the anchor chair?

10:40.673 --> 10:44.677
I knew it. After your show on the Orlando
shooting, they had to give it to you.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.012
Vlad, that's amazing.

10:46.078 --> 10:50.549
Okay, that plastic smile doesn't fool me.
I know. It burns. I got there first.

10:50.616 --> 10:53.786
I'm glad to know
some things never change.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.554
Look at this one.

10:55.621 --> 10:59.825
Can you imagine an eight-year-old
obsessed with Sam Cooke?

10:59.892 --> 11:01.861
Letta, she was just such an odd child.

11:01.927 --> 11:05.498
Okay, yeah, storytime's over.
We're gonna get outta here.

11:05.564 --> 11:07.900
Good. Show him some Atlanta.

11:07.967 --> 11:09.802
Y'all should check out the new spots.

11:09.869 --> 11:12.304
No, none of that hippity hoppity mess.

11:12.371 --> 11:15.574
Helen's right. That's not the way
to get the flavor of the city.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.643
How about this,
you letting me figure it out?

11:17.710 --> 11:19.145
But don't stay out too late.

11:19.211 --> 11:20.479
Go get your groove on, man.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.314
- Have a good time.
- Thank you.

11:27.086 --> 11:29.188
Already I cannot wait to break out.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.323
Come on. I think they're amazing.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.195
I know where I wanna take you.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.009
Yes.

11:51.510 --> 11:52.611
I love this.

11:53.412 --> 11:57.283
Man, I started sneaking out here
when I was 13.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.653
There's something so romantic
about drive-ins.

12:00.719 --> 12:01.987
Do you have these in the UK?

12:02.054 --> 12:03.956
This is strictly an American phenomenon.

12:04.023 --> 12:05.491
Really?

12:05.558 --> 12:07.893
God, I have so many memories out here.

12:10.096 --> 12:13.299
Like my first date, my first kiss.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.836
My first...

12:18.003 --> 12:20.306
- Yeah.
- You lost your...

12:20.372 --> 12:22.308
- ...here.
- Yeah.

12:22.374 --> 12:25.377
In the back seat of Dwayne
Payton's Toyota Celica.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.214
"Poetic Justice" was playing.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.449
You know what? This makes perfect sense.

12:30.516 --> 12:33.419
It's why you love
movie theater popcorn so much.

12:38.057 --> 12:39.325
You're so cute.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.873
What's wrong, baby?

12:55.207 --> 12:57.443
- Is it the kids?
- No.

12:58.043 --> 12:59.945
It's Redd...

13:00.012 --> 13:01.614
Redd Turner.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.550
He passed away.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.019
He was my old friend.

13:07.086 --> 13:08.587
Baby, I'm sorry.

13:09.155 --> 13:11.657
I know how much
he meant to you back in the day.

13:13.359 --> 13:16.228
Let's not discuss this around the kids.

13:16.295 --> 13:19.165
I don't wanna put a damper
on Letta's visit.

13:19.231 --> 13:20.566
I understand.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.035
I'm going to be okay.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.526
Mrs. Patterson!

14:21.694 --> 14:23.896
Lord have mercy!

14:27.533 --> 14:28.667
God...

14:28.734 --> 14:32.204
I have a husband and two sons.

14:32.271 --> 14:36.408
This is not my first run-in
with male anatomy.

14:36.475 --> 14:40.412
However, if I catch you
whipping that thing out here,

14:40.479 --> 14:41.880
under my roof,

14:41.947 --> 14:44.416
I'm gonna have to chop it off. Snip!

14:45.451 --> 14:48.220
I understand. I am so sorry.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.257
Mary Jane, a minute, please.

14:52.224 --> 14:55.594
Mom, I'm so sorry. I know how serious
you take the whole separate beds thing.

14:55.661 --> 14:58.964
Pauletta, how serious are you about Lee?

14:59.031 --> 15:01.467
I'm not seeing anybody else,
neither is he,

15:01.533 --> 15:03.569
and he wants me to meet his kids.

15:03.636 --> 15:04.837
He has kids?

15:04.903 --> 15:09.375
Yeah, mom, he's got two
with a baby mama in the UK.

15:10.276 --> 15:11.343
Okay.

15:11.410 --> 15:15.414
This isn't a bad thing
'cause you're about to turn 40,

15:15.481 --> 15:18.717
and your egg carton empty,
and even if you had any left,

15:18.784 --> 15:20.119
they'd probably crack.

15:20.185 --> 15:24.556
- Is he a good father?
- Very good, from what I can tell.

15:24.623 --> 15:26.725
Okay, he's already got kids,

15:26.792 --> 15:28.961
he came here to visit your family.

15:30.362 --> 15:32.264
I'm gonna stop you right there.

15:32.331 --> 15:35.834
I can assure you,
Lee came to Atlanta to perform.

15:35.901 --> 15:38.170
- Not to propose.
- Well, I don't know.

15:38.237 --> 15:41.740
He's already got your father
teaching him to make hog's head cheese.

15:41.807 --> 15:44.143
Now you just wait and see.

15:44.777 --> 15:49.615
A man can't be that interested
in hog's head cheese.

15:52.418 --> 15:56.255
I understand the rules. I just...

15:58.891 --> 16:00.192
Okay, I will.

16:01.327 --> 16:02.795
You, too.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.231
You all right?

16:07.333 --> 16:09.501
That was Treyvion's school.

16:10.035 --> 16:12.571
If he has another incident,
they'll kick him out.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.440
What? For biting a kid?

16:15.507 --> 16:17.743
This isn't the first time.

16:18.510 --> 16:21.580
It happened before.
He's been suspended twice.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.748
What? When?

16:22.815 --> 16:26.952
- A few weeks ago and then another time.
- Jesus, you didn't wanna tell anybody?

16:27.019 --> 16:29.021
And admit that I'm failing Treyvion?

16:29.088 --> 16:31.323
After what happened
with the settlement money.

16:31.390 --> 16:35.561
Niecy, you're not a bad mom.
Treyvion is not a bad kid.

16:35.627 --> 16:38.897
- It's about his nightmares.
- Well, try telling the school that.

16:38.964 --> 16:41.333
He cannot be the only kid
who misbehaves this way.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.770
Well, Darlene's son
has the same biting issue,

16:44.837 --> 16:47.106
but she and her husband
are major donors,

16:47.172 --> 16:50.109
and if the school loses their kid,
they lose their coin.

16:50.175 --> 16:55.013
This isn't about money.
It's partly about it, but let me guess.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.583
- Darlene's White.
- Yeah.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.918
You haven't been watching
the morning show?

17:01.253 --> 17:03.589
This thing has been happening
all over the country.

17:03.655 --> 17:07.292
Black kids are receiving harsher
punishment for the same infractions.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.061
Treyvion's just the latest example.

17:10.562 --> 17:11.663
So, what should I do?

17:11.730 --> 17:15.134
You fight for your kid
to get the same treatment as his peers.

17:16.835 --> 17:18.337
You got this.

17:19.638 --> 17:20.706
Here you go, Mom.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.374
Cue cards all numbered and in order.

17:22.441 --> 17:25.210
- Wonderful.
- Can I go? The dance is about to start.

17:25.277 --> 17:28.013
That's fine. Listen, but before you go,
I wanna talk to you.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.415
Okay? One minute.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.186
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Take it.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.455
Your dad told me you were having sex.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.123
- You're giving me this, here?
- Yes.

17:38.190 --> 17:41.827
Max, I've been trying to have
this conversation with you for two days.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.663
Look at me. Do you know about safe sex?

17:44.730 --> 17:47.733
- Are you being careful?
- Like you're being careful with Orlando?

17:48.200 --> 17:50.869
Don't pretend you guys are friends.
I'm not 4 years old.

17:50.936 --> 17:54.373
What I do in my private life
is my business, okay?

17:54.440 --> 17:57.876
- But my sex life is your business?
- Yes, it's my job to be in your business.

17:57.943 --> 17:59.011
I am your mother.

17:59.077 --> 18:01.613
My business
is a 16-year-old girl with braces.

18:01.680 --> 18:02.714
I think I can handle it.

18:03.615 --> 18:04.917
Come over here.

18:07.619 --> 18:09.188
I'll see you later, Mom.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.089
Be careful.

18:12.191 --> 18:15.994
A lot of the traditional black cuisine
was born out of slavery.

18:18.530 --> 18:22.768
They had to make do with the leftovers
from the cow and the pigs.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.736
Stuff white folks didn't want.

18:24.803 --> 18:26.205
That's right.

18:27.139 --> 18:30.442
That's where tripe
and chitlins and hog maws

18:30.509 --> 18:33.812
and pig's feet
and hog's head cheese come from.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.782
It's amazing, the resilience
of our people in this country.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.251
I remember, as a little boy,

18:39.318 --> 18:42.454
knee-high to a grasshopper,
my grandfather,

18:42.521 --> 18:46.125
whose face, arms, and body
bore the scars of slavery.

18:46.191 --> 18:47.860
He would take me to market with him.

18:47.926 --> 18:51.163
I can't tell you how many times
I witnessed

18:51.697 --> 18:54.366
this strong, dignified man

18:54.433 --> 18:56.969
turn into a cowering submissive

18:57.035 --> 18:59.104
in front of those white shop owners.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.307
The humiliation...

19:03.942 --> 19:05.711
was hard to watch.

19:08.313 --> 19:13.352
Anyway, that's why I make this.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.856
My kids think it's nasty.

19:21.793 --> 19:25.998
But it reminds me of my Papa
and all the things he went through

19:26.064 --> 19:28.133
to give us a better life.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.275
I still can't believe this is happening.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.510
My two favorite men...

19:38.577 --> 19:41.346
bonding over hog's head cheese.

19:41.413 --> 19:44.583
Well, you'd better get ready
because in about eight hours,

19:44.650 --> 19:46.485
you'll taste my first official batch.

19:46.552 --> 19:49.121
- Excuse me, I'm gonna go wash up.
- Thank you.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.491
Jeez, it's almost seven.
I've gotta get changed.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.526
Go on. Do your thing.
I'll see you in an hour.

19:54.593 --> 19:55.694
All right.

20:03.335 --> 20:04.503
This looks good.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.173
I do not mind if I do.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.609
You cannot be hungry again.

20:10.676 --> 20:11.944
Ravenous.

20:12.678 --> 20:15.047
- What did you just say?
- Ravenous?

20:15.747 --> 20:17.149
Famished.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.184
Dude, can't you just say hungry?

20:19.251 --> 20:20.919
All right, hungry.

20:20.986 --> 20:22.120
What are you up to?

20:22.187 --> 20:25.824
I'm dealing with my son's preschool,
something you wouldn't know about.

20:25.891 --> 20:29.428
I know you probably went to some fancy
boarding school, or something like that.

20:29.494 --> 20:31.029
No, no.

20:31.096 --> 20:33.932
You and me have much more
in common than you know.

20:35.334 --> 20:36.501
How's that?

20:36.568 --> 20:37.769
I'm a single father.

20:37.836 --> 20:41.273
Years ago, my son was acting out.
He was fighting.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.977
He got kicked out of three nurseries.

20:45.043 --> 20:48.013
- You got a kid?
- Kids. Plural.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.716
How are you dealing
with the preschool issue?

20:55.921 --> 20:58.790
I've heard your tweets have gotten you
in a bit of a pickle before.

20:58.857 --> 21:01.693
A kielbasa sized pickle.

21:02.394 --> 21:05.864
Look, do you mind if we take this
in a different direction?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.799
I am, after all,
the man with a good humor.

21:07.866 --> 21:10.535
- Well, humor me, then.
- Okay.

21:17.743 --> 21:21.213
Okay.
You're all right for a foreigner, Lee.

21:21.279 --> 21:23.515
- I'm gonna take that as a compliment.
- You should.

21:24.216 --> 21:27.519
- Don't eat all the pie, dude.
- I cannot guarantee that.

21:30.722 --> 21:32.157
How do I look?

21:33.859 --> 21:35.427
I know what Niecy would say.

21:35.494 --> 21:37.162
Damn, girl, you look fine!

21:37.229 --> 21:40.399
That's what I like to hear.
What were you guys talking about?

21:41.466 --> 21:42.801
Treyvion.

21:43.335 --> 21:46.538
I don't mean to pry, but have you
ever thought about therapy for him?

21:46.605 --> 21:48.240
No, black families here,

21:48.306 --> 21:50.842
we don't normally do
the whole therapy thing.

21:50.909 --> 21:52.110
Yes, that makes sense.

21:52.177 --> 21:56.281
Why get the mental health care
you need, when you can suffer in silence?

21:56.348 --> 21:59.251
Exactly. I mean,
truth be told, my mom thinks

21:59.317 --> 22:03.488
all Treyvion needs is Sunday School
to pray the nightmares out of him.

22:03.555 --> 22:05.590
That sounds like a plot
from a horror movie.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.325
Exactly. You ready?

22:08.694 --> 22:10.395
I'm Mary Jane Paul live

22:10.462 --> 22:14.566
from the Thurgood Marshall
dedication here in Atlanta.

22:14.633 --> 22:18.036
Mayor Reed. Hi, Mary Jane Paul
from "Great Day USA."

22:18.103 --> 22:19.504
Can you explain to our viewers

22:19.571 --> 22:22.274
the significance of this event
and what it means to you?

22:22.340 --> 22:24.743
Thurgood Marshall
was the first African-American

22:24.810 --> 22:26.611
appointed to the US Supreme Court.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.681
He played an essential role
in ending legal segregation.

22:29.748 --> 22:32.184
I'm thrilled to be here
to celebrate his legacy.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.119
You actually knew Thurgood Marshall.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.055
In fact, in 1977,
Judge Marshall swore you in

22:37.122 --> 22:40.058
as the first African-American
ambassador to the UN.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.894
Can you tell us something
about the man you knew Marshall to be?

22:42.961 --> 22:46.164
When I was
in the sixth-grade class in 1941,

22:46.231 --> 22:49.267
we had a teacher take us down
to a federal courtroom,

22:49.334 --> 22:51.903
and I heard this tall, skinny young man

22:51.970 --> 22:55.807
arguing the case for equal salaries
between black and white teachers,

22:55.874 --> 22:59.511
so, when I started working
with Martin Luther King in '61,

22:59.578 --> 23:03.448
I knew that there was 20 years
of legal foundation

23:03.515 --> 23:05.984
that he had prepared
that made it possible

23:06.051 --> 23:08.353
for us to do the demonstrations we did.

23:08.420 --> 23:10.856
We've got Dr. C.T. Vivian here.

23:10.922 --> 23:14.359
It's such an honor. You were instrumental
in the Civil Rights Movement,

23:14.426 --> 23:17.028
riding the first Freedom Bus
throughout the South

23:17.095 --> 23:19.798
and working very closely
alongside Dr. Martin Luther King.

23:19.865 --> 23:22.701
Tell us, what does Thurgood Marshall's
legacy mean to you?

23:22.768 --> 23:26.371
It was his understanding
of law, and his courage

23:26.438 --> 23:31.743
to force the courts
into doing what, in the South,

23:31.810 --> 23:33.411
they did not want to do.

23:33.478 --> 23:36.848
It's that combination
that made it possible

23:36.915 --> 23:39.050
for him to go on later,

23:39.117 --> 23:41.486
but for all of us to move forward.

23:41.553 --> 23:43.822
Can I get a beer? Thanks, man.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.897
- Are you having fun yet?
- I'm thoroughly enjoying watching you.

23:51.963 --> 23:56.334
- You're killing it.
- Wow, look who's here.

23:56.401 --> 23:57.435
Who?

23:57.502 --> 24:00.438
It's Judge McAllister.
Kara's been circling him for months.

24:01.907 --> 24:04.543
The guy who's been nominated
for the Supreme Court.

24:04.609 --> 24:08.180
Yeah, it's looking like he is
turning down every producer here.

24:09.948 --> 24:13.285
He's here celebrating Marshall,
so he's aware of the optics.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.721
Maybe I have a shot?

24:16.788 --> 24:20.392
- ...or at your chambers. We can do...
- Honored, honored.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.894
Don't waste your time there, Mary Jane.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.163
I am so close to getting
the judge to sit with me.

24:25.230 --> 24:26.631
Close is not a done deal, Vlad.

24:27.699 --> 24:31.770
Mary Jane thinks she's gonna score
this interview for "Great Day USA."

24:31.837 --> 24:32.871
I'm gonna try.

24:32.938 --> 24:35.373
Are you gonna fit it
in between cooking segments?

24:36.441 --> 24:38.910
You won't laugh
when I get a seat at his table.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.946
I want in on this.

24:41.012 --> 24:42.848
Me, too. Count me in.

24:42.914 --> 24:45.617
You do know I have more game
than all of you put together, right?

24:46.952 --> 24:52.290
Well, then, let's let the best "man" win.

24:53.091 --> 24:54.826
Easy money, honey.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.795
Good luck.

25:03.101 --> 25:05.937
I have to figure out a way
to get Vlad away from the judge.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.276
What are you doing?

25:11.343 --> 25:13.879
If I told you, what fun would that be?

25:13.945 --> 25:15.714
You know I detest surprises.

25:16.748 --> 25:18.283
Sorry, I'm Lee Truitt.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.785
You're that famous
cable news anchor, right?

25:20.852 --> 25:22.787
Vladimir Frederick.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.290
Did you hear Reverend Jackson
is making an appearance?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.926
- He's pulling up now.
- Where'd you hear that?

25:27.993 --> 25:30.929
Manager. He was talking
to that white guy. What's his name?

25:30.996 --> 25:33.031
- The Silver Fox.
- Anderson Cooper?

25:35.667 --> 25:37.469
Next drink's on me, man.

25:37.535 --> 25:39.671
Reverend Jackson. All right.

25:52.784 --> 25:54.085
Judge McAllister.

25:55.053 --> 25:57.856
Hi, I'm Mary Jane Paul
from "Great Day USA."

25:57.923 --> 25:59.157
Miss Paul, a pleasure.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.226
You have proper manners, Your Honor.

26:01.293 --> 26:02.961
My mother always told me.

26:03.028 --> 26:05.130
Good manners show people
you respect them.

26:05.196 --> 26:08.033
- And their feelings.
- Your mother sounds like a wise woman.

26:08.099 --> 26:10.035
Well, I owe her everything.

26:10.101 --> 26:12.971
This is a remarkable event, isn't it?

26:13.038 --> 26:14.205
It is.

26:14.272 --> 26:17.809
As a judge yourself, you must feel
pretty honored to be here tonight.

26:17.876 --> 26:20.111
I do. I'm truly honored to be here.

26:20.845 --> 26:23.448
And to quote the late President Johnson,

26:23.515 --> 26:28.053
Justice Marshall symbolized
what is best about our American society.

26:28.119 --> 26:31.356
The belief that human
rights must be satisfied

26:31.423 --> 26:33.992
through the orderly processes of law.

26:35.293 --> 26:38.530
I'm sure you have been approached
by every journalist here tonight.

26:38.596 --> 26:41.366
Then you're aware of my reservations
regarding interviews.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.903
I am aware, sir, but you must be aware

26:44.970 --> 26:47.872
that these cable outfits,
they need ratings,

26:47.939 --> 26:51.176
and for those ratings, they'll excoriate
your record like bloodhounds,

26:51.242 --> 26:53.578
and still magically
only pull in 300 000 viewers.

26:53.645 --> 26:57.282
At "Great Day USA,"
we've got five million viewers.

26:57.349 --> 27:00.685
Our show is friendly, and relatable.

27:00.752 --> 27:03.722
It's the perfect opportunity
to meet the man behind the robe.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.624
I appreciate your candor.
You make a strong argument.

27:06.691 --> 27:10.161
- Have you thought about going into law?
- Yeah, I considered it.

27:10.228 --> 27:12.597
But we both know that the law...

27:12.664 --> 27:14.466
is not about the truth.

27:15.266 --> 27:18.470
I'm someone who believes
that the news still is.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.940
I'm impressed, Miss Paul.

27:22.007 --> 27:24.743
And like good manners, I appreciate that.

27:24.809 --> 27:25.910
Well...

27:27.479 --> 27:28.613
To good manners.

27:29.547 --> 27:30.749
To good manners.

27:30.815 --> 27:33.651
- Lee Truitt.
- A shot of that.

27:33.718 --> 27:35.820
Was it her plan or yours?

27:35.887 --> 27:39.157
Distracting me
while she goes in for the kill?

27:39.224 --> 27:40.291
Guilty as charged.

27:40.358 --> 27:41.793
All right.

27:44.295 --> 27:46.131
Man, that Mary Jane.

27:46.197 --> 27:48.433
She always gets exactly what she wants.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.168
What is it about her?

27:52.237 --> 27:55.507
When we were cub reporters, I must have
asked her out a half a dozen times.

27:55.573 --> 27:58.810
She only dates ballers, shot-callers,

27:59.244 --> 28:02.414
men with deep pockets
that can do something for her.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.717
I mean, that's Mary Jane.

28:05.784 --> 28:07.886
You know, always looking out
for number one.

28:08.787 --> 28:10.488
Screw everybody else.

28:11.423 --> 28:12.857
Maybe she's changed.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.261
Women like that don't change.

28:16.327 --> 28:18.797
Okay, second thought. They do change.

28:19.764 --> 28:21.433
But not for very long.

28:33.511 --> 28:35.413
I'll take it from here, Mary Jane.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.315
Judge McAllister.

28:37.382 --> 28:40.118
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
I think you'd like him.

28:40.185 --> 28:41.586
Excuse me, Ms. Paul.

28:45.890 --> 28:48.059
He is laying it on thick tonight.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.962
You know Vlad.
He can't stand to lose a bet.

28:51.029 --> 28:53.965
It seems like him and McAllister
are already old friends.

28:54.032 --> 28:56.167
It's so good to see you, Mary Jane.

28:56.234 --> 28:57.869
- Bye.
- Yeah, bye.

28:58.770 --> 28:59.771
Good luck.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.741
I am so sorry.
I really thought we had him.

29:03.808 --> 29:06.511
Don't worry, we've got bigger fish
to catch in New York.

29:10.281 --> 29:13.284
Wait. Hold up. I still may have a pulse.

29:13.351 --> 29:16.054
You know that research
you did on McAllister and his family?

29:16.121 --> 29:18.590
- Yes.
- I'm about to put it to good use.

29:24.028 --> 29:25.597
A powerful image.

29:25.663 --> 29:27.465
A powerful man.

29:28.133 --> 29:30.668
Madam Attorney General, Mary Jane Paul.

29:30.735 --> 29:32.370
It's so nice to meet you.

29:33.938 --> 29:37.275
You know, I noticed you standing
not too far away from your husband,

29:37.342 --> 29:40.612
and I've gotta say
your receiving line rivaled his.

29:40.678 --> 29:42.046
Don't tell him that.

29:42.113 --> 29:45.150
Tonight, I am simply here
as Judge McAllister's wife.

29:45.216 --> 29:49.187
- You must be so proud of your husband.
- I really am.

29:49.687 --> 29:51.656
He's gotta be proud of you as well.

29:52.290 --> 29:57.061
I hear your next move may be taking over
the National Women's Health Organization?

29:57.128 --> 30:00.598
Where did you hear that?
That's not public knowledge yet.

30:00.665 --> 30:02.667
I've got my sources.

30:02.734 --> 30:06.204
You know, it's always good keeping tabs
on women who make a real difference.

30:08.406 --> 30:10.942
You look familiar.
Now what do you do for a living?

30:11.009 --> 30:13.711
I'm a journalist and a correspondent
with "Great Day USA."

30:13.778 --> 30:15.246
- Do you know it?
- Do I know it?

30:15.313 --> 30:17.048
Of course. I watch it every morning.

30:17.115 --> 30:20.919
I just love that Ronda Sales.
Smart cookie, that one.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.254
Ronda was my idol.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.457
It has been a dream working with her.

30:26.524 --> 30:29.194
We were trying to convince
your husband to come on our show.

30:29.260 --> 30:32.063
I think that is a fantastic idea.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.065
Your husband does not think so.

30:34.799 --> 30:36.668
Leave that to me.

30:36.734 --> 30:38.503
We'll be in touch.

30:41.973 --> 30:46.544
A toast to you, MJ, for landing
the biggest whale of the night.

30:46.611 --> 30:49.147
And to you, Lee,
for that valuable assist.

30:49.214 --> 30:50.548
Here!

30:53.851 --> 30:57.689
I am happy to dust off
the old improv skills for a good cause.

30:58.523 --> 30:59.557
It burns.

30:59.624 --> 31:02.894
Here's to the best "man"
with the prettiest face.

31:02.961 --> 31:06.831
You know, if I had your tits,
I would have scored McAllister, too.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.469
Come on, Vlad. Come on.
Don't be a sore loser.

31:11.536 --> 31:14.339
Why don't you listen
to your mate and piss off?

31:15.273 --> 31:16.641
What?

31:17.175 --> 31:20.211
She's tough. She can take it.

31:20.278 --> 31:22.080
Right, MJ?

31:27.418 --> 31:28.620
Damn it, man.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.194
I appreciate you defending me, babe.

31:37.895 --> 31:39.330
Where did all that come from?

31:41.566 --> 31:43.201
Darth Vlad-er.

31:43.268 --> 31:45.470
He had pretty harsh words for you.

31:45.536 --> 31:47.205
Yeah, he was drunk.

31:49.307 --> 31:53.044
He said you were a self-serving bitch,
who only looks after number one.

31:53.111 --> 31:54.212
Damn.

31:54.279 --> 31:55.880
You really should've hit him harder.

31:57.215 --> 31:58.916
Is there anything to it?

31:59.484 --> 32:02.487
Or is Vlad just salty
you never gave him the time of day?

32:03.955 --> 32:06.291
Salty might be a good word, but...

32:07.292 --> 32:12.764
The Mary Jane that he described,
that was in the past.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.301
I'm different.

32:16.367 --> 32:18.736
- Are you?
- I am.

32:18.803 --> 32:22.307
And the biggest difference
is I'm actually making an effort.

32:31.182 --> 32:32.817
Well, if you can...

32:32.884 --> 32:34.285
so can I.

32:34.986 --> 32:36.220
Yeah.

32:42.493 --> 32:46.564
Did I ever tell you
getting in a bar fight in the South

32:46.631 --> 32:48.333
has always been one of my fantasies?

32:48.399 --> 32:49.434
Really?

32:49.500 --> 32:53.237
Well, remind me to never question
your masculinity ever again.

32:58.076 --> 33:00.378
When you told me
about your trip down here,

33:01.212 --> 33:03.314
I asked my agent to book me a gig.

33:04.949 --> 33:06.517
I wanted to meet your family.

33:08.152 --> 33:10.888
- I'm glad you did.
- Me, too.

33:12.957 --> 33:15.460
Wait, I've got something for this.

33:48.426 --> 33:50.027
What Vlad said...

33:52.563 --> 33:54.499
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

34:31.936 --> 34:33.538
Tell me what you want.

34:35.506 --> 34:36.808
Tell me you love me.

34:38.576 --> 34:39.844
I love you.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.549
I love you, too.

34:59.497 --> 35:01.899
That album has to be here somewhere.

35:02.967 --> 35:04.368
Mom...

35:04.435 --> 35:07.238
I found out why Lee
really came to Atlanta.

35:07.305 --> 35:10.575
No, no, not to propose, Mom. Sorry.

35:10.975 --> 35:12.877
He did wanna meet my family.

35:14.979 --> 35:17.181
He... loves me.

35:18.249 --> 35:20.451
I'm so happy for you.

35:20.518 --> 35:25.022
You know, now, this Lee,
he just might be the one.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.426
Now don't go mucking it up.

35:28.493 --> 35:29.994
Yeah, yeah.

35:33.698 --> 35:35.233
You found it!

35:44.742 --> 35:46.310
Mom, is that you?

35:47.211 --> 35:49.614
Yeah, 50 years ago.

35:51.582 --> 35:55.486
I was singing with a blues band
with a man named Redd Turner,

35:55.553 --> 35:58.055
and he passed just a few days ago.

36:00.691 --> 36:02.860
It brought back a flood of memories.

36:06.197 --> 36:08.733
I gave up doing what I love

36:09.567 --> 36:13.170
because I fell in love with your Daddy.

36:14.438 --> 36:15.907
But don't get me wrong.

36:15.973 --> 36:18.776
I wanted to get married
and have a family.

36:19.443 --> 36:24.048
But I've always regretted
that I gave up my singing career.

36:24.115 --> 36:25.616
Always.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.452
Now I want you to have this.

36:30.187 --> 36:32.056
As a reminder.

36:33.691 --> 36:36.627
It doesn't have to be
that way with you, Letta.

36:37.628 --> 36:40.531
You can have it all.

36:42.767 --> 36:43.935
Remember that.

36:51.242 --> 36:52.843
Baby girl.

36:54.679 --> 36:56.013
Auntie?

36:56.080 --> 36:58.516
- Hey, you all packed up?
- Well, I'm getting there.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.151
- How's Treyvion?
- He's better.

37:00.217 --> 37:02.486
You being here this weekend helped.

37:02.553 --> 37:05.056
You know, before I leave,
I wanted to ask you something.

37:05.823 --> 37:08.593
Would you ever consider
taking Treyvion to see a therapist?

37:10.027 --> 37:11.162
I would,

37:11.228 --> 37:14.131
I just don't want him to be labeled
some kind of mental case.

37:14.198 --> 37:16.634
No, they would never label him that way.

37:17.368 --> 37:18.336
I promise.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.339
But, Niecy, he needs help.

37:21.806 --> 37:23.574
I'm willing to pay for it.

37:24.442 --> 37:26.177
Yeah, I'll do it.

37:26.243 --> 37:28.245
He needs it. I'll do it.

37:28.312 --> 37:30.114
Thank you. I appreciate it.

37:31.649 --> 37:33.517
I love you. It was good having you.

37:34.018 --> 37:36.854
Thank you, Atlanta, Georgia,
for the humidity.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.155
Damn, it's hot down here!

37:38.222 --> 37:39.590
For the bar fight.

37:40.524 --> 37:43.060
And, most of all,
for the hog's head cheese.

37:47.598 --> 37:51.202
My God, Auntie.
Beyoncé just liked my tweet.

37:51.268 --> 37:53.004
- Wait, let me see that.
- My tweet.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.873
Damn, girl, you wrote that?

37:56.674 --> 37:58.209
Lee helped me out.

37:58.275 --> 37:59.644
He's really dope.

38:00.277 --> 38:02.346
Yeah, he is.

38:07.852 --> 38:12.556
Now I have a very special guest for you,
ladies and gentlemen.

38:12.623 --> 38:15.993
Atlanta's very own.
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up

38:16.060 --> 38:17.395
for Miss Helen Patterson,

38:17.461 --> 38:21.799
who's gonna come up here
and sing us a blues number.

38:21.866 --> 38:23.601
Come on, Miss Helen.

38:23.668 --> 38:24.935
Come on.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.044
I'd like to dedicate this song

38:33.110 --> 38:36.781
to a very dear friend of 50 years,

38:36.847 --> 38:38.349
Redd Turner.

38:40.051 --> 38:41.719
<i>There ain't nothin'</i>

38:43.120 --> 38:45.089
<i>I can do</i>

38:46.590 --> 38:50.361
<i>Or nothin' I can say</i>

38:52.430 --> 38:56.767
<i>That folks don't criticize me</i>

38:59.070 --> 39:01.405
<i>But I'm gonna do</i>

39:02.606 --> 39:05.876
<i>Just as I want to</i>

39:08.579 --> 39:11.482
<i>Anyway</i>

39:13.184 --> 39:15.252
<i>I don't care</i>

39:16.153 --> 39:20.891
<i>Just what people say</i>

39:22.960 --> 39:26.564
<i>If I should take a notion</i>

39:27.865 --> 39:30.367
<i>To jump up into the ocean</i>

39:31.569 --> 39:34.505
<i>Ain't nobody's business</i>

39:34.572 --> 39:36.407
<i>If I do</i>

39:39.243 --> 39:43.914
<i>If I go to church on Sunday</i>

39:43.981 --> 39:47.485
<i>Then cabaret all day Monday</i>

39:48.853 --> 39:50.588
<i>Ain't nobody's business</i>

39:51.555 --> 39:53.057
<i>If I do</i>

39:56.994 --> 39:59.764
<i>Ain't nobody's business</i>

40:00.898 --> 40:05.436
<i>If I do</i>

40:09.039 --> 40:10.407
Yeah!
