02:52.340 --> 02:54.442

02:54.542 --> 02:57.311
- SHE NEVER WOULD'VE KNOWN.
- SHE'D HAVE SEEN.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.046

03:03.083 --> 03:04.852
NOT TO HER FACE, ANYHOW.

03:04.952 --> 03:07.187

03:10.724 --> 03:12.926
YOU WANT TO KNOW HER NAME?

03:36.584 --> 03:39.253
Leader:
JUST GO, MOVE! GO ON.

03:46.627 --> 03:51.865

04:05.012 --> 04:08.616
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND?

04:12.453 --> 04:15.155
ARE YOU GONNA
TAKE HIM UP?

04:15.255 --> 04:18.626
SHE WANTS TO SEE YOU FIRST...

04:21.194 --> 04:22.863
LEE.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.870
- FORGET IT.

SHINING FACES.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.467
( laughs )

04:59.567 --> 05:01.502
NOW WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER

05:01.602 --> 05:03.604
RITA SUE FLASHED HER BLUBBERS?

05:03.704 --> 05:05.706
WHY YOU GOTTA MAKE
EVERYTHING SO DIRTY?

05:05.806 --> 05:08.208
'CAUSE THE LAST THING WE NEED
IS A BUNCH OF MOTHER HENS

05:08.308 --> 05:11.712
GUM FLAPPIN' TO THE LAW
ABOUT LITTLE JOHNNY
SEEING A TITTY SHOW.

05:11.812 --> 05:15.483
OKAY, WELL THEN,
WE COULD MAKE IT CLEAN.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.352
YOU COULD PUT A CHURCH DRESS
AND A BONNET ON RITA SUE

05:18.452 --> 05:21.021
AND IT AIN'T
GONNA BE CLEAN.

05:21.121 --> 05:24.758
MATTER OF FACT,
IT MIGHT EVEN BE
A LITTLE DIRTIER,

05:24.858 --> 05:27.795
LONG AS IT COMES DOWN
TO KNICKERS IN THE END.

05:27.895 --> 05:30.063
AFTER SUNSET.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.406
WHERE'S ANGUS?

05:38.506 --> 05:40.974
- TOOK OFF.
- SHIT.

05:42.275 --> 05:45.846
SAID HE'S TIRED OF WORKING
WITH A SPLIT-TAIL.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.717
AIN'T THAT WHAT HE SAID?

05:49.817 --> 05:51.652
DIDN'T SAY NOTHING
LIKE THAT TO ME.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.521

05:53.621 --> 05:55.456
AIN'T YOU GOT GLOVES?

05:55.556 --> 05:59.092
I DID.
BUT I DON'T NO MORE.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.430
HELL, JONESY,

HER END OF THE LOAD.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.565
SHUT THE HELL UP, BURLEY.
GIRL'S MA DIED.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.601
SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO FIND HER WAY.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.003
MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO GROW A PAIR
AND CAN HER ASS.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.606
WHAT WAS THAT?

06:14.708 --> 06:16.444

06:55.348 --> 06:57.718
FOUR FEET DEEP.

07:01.589 --> 07:05.559
Justin:

07:05.659 --> 07:12.533

CELESTE DOESN'T MEAN

07:32.986 --> 07:35.322
I CAN'T TAKE DOWN LAUNDRY
FROM TIME TO TIME.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.357
IDLE HANDS.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.226
CELESTE.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.230
WHAT IS IT?

07:43.330 --> 07:47.935
OH, I'M AFRAID
SHE'S NOT WORKING OUT.

07:51.839 --> 07:55.609
* AND THOUGH THE WORLD

07:55.709 --> 08:02.115

08:58.271 --> 09:00.908
IT'S ALL OVER NOW.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.612
IT'S ALL OVER NOW.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.947
( muted whimpering )

09:49.990 --> 09:52.192
IS THAT HER?

09:53.727 --> 09:57.097
- BETTER DAYS.

NOPE.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.375

13:33.380 --> 13:37.050
DIDN'T KNOW JANES
COULD PESSPIRE LIKE THAT.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.121
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
FLETCH?

13:41.221 --> 13:44.124
AIN'T YOU NEVER MADE
A WOMAN SWEAT BEFORE?

13:44.224 --> 13:48.428
I SAY SHE WON'T GO
MORE THAN 40 MINUTES
BEFORE SHE PASSES OUT.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.531
NO. SHE'S TOUGH.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.133
SHE'S GOT TWO HOURS
IN HER.

13:53.233 --> 13:57.470
HALF OF A BEAN SAYS
SHE KEELS IN 30.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.941

Burley:
HEY, STUMP!

14:16.389 --> 14:19.226

OH YEAH?

14:20.693 --> 14:23.163
THAT'S REAL--
THAT'S REAL NICE.

14:23.263 --> 14:26.733
- HOW'S RITA SUE?

14:26.833 --> 14:28.768
SHE IS THAT,

14:28.868 --> 14:33.540
HEY, UH,
I WAS WONDERING...

14:33.640 --> 14:36.676

14:36.776 --> 14:39.046
IF YOU COULD...

14:39.146 --> 14:41.648
SQUEEZE ME IN TONIGHT.
YOU KNOW?

14:41.748 --> 14:44.784
( chuckles)
SORRY.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.387
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SORRY?

14:47.487 --> 14:51.391
RITA DON'T ROLL WITH TRADE.
IT'S BAD FOR BUSINESS.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.996
WHAT ABOUT JONESY?

14:59.766 --> 15:01.401
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

15:01.501 --> 15:02.802
HE GOT HISSELF
A PIECE.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.273
IT WAS GOOD
FOR BUSINESS THEN.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.910
( chuckles )
FORGET IT.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.291
Ben:
HERE'S THE STAIRS.

15:24.391 --> 15:25.658
THERE YOU GO.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.928
- YOU GOT IT.
- Crone: YEAH,
I GOT YOU, SONNY.

15:29.029 --> 15:32.132
DID HE EVER SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT ME?

15:32.232 --> 15:34.034
ABOUT WHY HE LEFT US?

15:34.134 --> 15:37.870
- THERE WAS PEOPLE AFTER HIM.
- PEOPLE? WHAT PEOPLE?

15:37.971 --> 15:40.307
ERN!

15:44.844 --> 15:46.846
- HOW'D SHE GET OUT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.050
ARE THOSE YOUR COUSINS
DOWN THERE?

15:51.051 --> 15:53.220
COUSINS?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.856
YEAH, I GUESS THEY ARE.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.659
YOU KNOW, BEN,
THOSE BOYS ARE
JEALOUS OF YOU.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.962
- THEY'D LIKE TO SEE YOU DEAD.
- GRAMMY, THAT AIN'T TRUE.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.732
- IT AIN'T LIKE THAT,
AIN'T RIGHT.
- NO. NO.

16:05.832 --> 16:08.968
- IS THAT RIGHT?
- OH, SURELY IS.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.904
GO ON, ASK LEE.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.141
HE'LL TELL YOU.

16:14.241 --> 16:17.344
GRAMMY,
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
WE CAN BRING-BRING IT

16:17.444 --> 16:20.013
- RIGHT UPSTAIRS
TO YOU, YOU KNOW.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.382
YOU KNOW
YOUR DADDY GREW UP
IN THIS HOUSE.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.452
OH, MY BABY.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.388
SO PRETTY WHEN HE WAS
A YOUNG 'UN.

16:28.488 --> 16:32.692
HE HAD LONG RINGLETS
AND PERFECT LITTLE HANDS.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.295
MA'AM,
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE
MY DADDY MIGHT BE NOW?

16:35.395 --> 16:37.764
( violently ) QUESTIONS!
ALL YOU DO IS ASK QUESTIONS.

16:37.864 --> 16:41.268
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR DADDY!

16:48.208 --> 16:50.710
( sniffing )
OOH.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.380
YOU SMELL
JUST LIKE HIM.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.193
( Stumpy chuckles )

17:06.293 --> 17:08.328
HEY, WHAT WAS
THE NAME OF THE DEAL

17:08.428 --> 17:11.498
CHUBB BOUCHET
DID DOWN IN MOBILE?
WHAT DID HE CALL THAT?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.034
- THE LUNCH COUNTER.
- ( chuckles )

17:15.135 --> 17:16.736
YEAH, THAT WAS IT.
THE LUNCH COUNTER.

17:16.836 --> 17:20.140
THAT WAS IT.
MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO GIVE
THAT A WHIRL.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.076
- FORGET IT.
- COME ON, HONEY.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.844
IT'LL BE LIKE
OLD TIMES.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.947
HONEY PIE,
IF THAT'S YOUR IDEA
OF A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE,

17:28.047 --> 17:30.016
I THINK I'LL STICK
TO THE HIGHWAY.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.418
WHAT'S
"THE LUNCH COUNTER"?

17:31.518 --> 17:35.021
QUICKEST WAY TO MAKE
A HEAP A SUGAR, KIDDO.

17:35.122 --> 17:38.491
YOU LINE UP
ALL THE JOHNNIES
IN THE BLOW-OFF,

17:38.591 --> 17:40.960
AND THEN YOU SQUAT DOWN
ON THE EDGE OF THE STAGE

17:41.060 --> 17:43.830
AND YOU CLIPHEM EACH
A NICKEL SO THEY CAN
LICK YOUR SNATCH.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.598
RIGHT THERE
IN THE TENT?

17:45.698 --> 17:48.768
- NO, THAT AIN'T IT.
- OH REALLY? THEN WHAT
IS IT, FELIX?

17:48.868 --> 17:51.738
IT'S-- WELL--
WELL, FOR STARTERS,

17:51.838 --> 17:54.574
YOU DON'T CHARGE THEM A NICKEL.
FOUR BITS, MINIMUM.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.344
UH-HUH. IT'S LOW.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.713
HEY, LIB.
GET A LOAD OF THIS
FEATHER TRIM!

18:00.813 --> 18:01.981
NO, IT AIN'T LOW!

18:02.081 --> 18:03.416
IT AIN'T--
GOD DAMN IT,

18:03.516 --> 18:05.952
WE ARE PAINTING OURSELVES
INTO A REAL CORNER,

18:06.052 --> 18:07.420
PASSING UP
A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES!

18:07.520 --> 18:10.990
JUST THIS MORNING,
I HAD TO TURN AWAY BURLEY.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.394
- BURLEY?
- TIMES IS HARD, BABY.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.863
WE GOT TO LOOK TO...

18:16.963 --> 18:20.767
MANIFEST OUR--
DIVERSITY.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.779
- YOU IN THE HOLE
AGAIN, DADDY?
- NO!

18:34.547 --> 18:36.649
NO, HONEY.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.752
NO.

18:39.852 --> 18:43.156
JUST BUSINESS
IS ALL.

18:44.424 --> 18:48.528
PITCHING IN TO HELP KEEP
THIS FLEA CIRCUS ROLLING.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.333
WELL, I COULD DO IT.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.834
WHAT?

18:54.934 --> 18:57.304
THE LUNCH COUNTER.

18:57.404 --> 19:00.640
IT DON'T SOUND SO BAD.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.647
HELL, YOUR MOM'S RIGHT.
THAT IS A DUMB IDEA.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.450
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I EVEN THOUGHT OF IT.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.699
( mariachi music playing )

19:33.973 --> 19:36.409
( knocks at door )

19:41.113 --> 19:43.049
CAN I HELP YOU?

19:43.149 --> 19:45.685
MIGHT I HAVE A WORD
WITH YOU, SIR?

19:45.785 --> 19:48.054
ABOUT WHAT?

19:48.154 --> 19:51.324
WELL,
IT'S JUST ROUTINE.

19:51.424 --> 19:54.060
PERHAPS YOUR
PERSONAL FEELINGS
FOR MY SISTER

19:54.160 --> 19:55.795
ARE CLOUDING
YOUR OBJECTIVITY.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.731
JUSTIN, I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S GOING TO COME
TO THIS CONCLUSION.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.733
THE WAITRESS COULD'VE
BEEN MISTAKEN.

20:00.833 --> 20:04.904
AND AS FOR ELEANOR,
GIVEN HER HISTORY,
SHE'S HARDLY RELIABLE.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.907
OKAY, MAYBE IRIS WON'T BE
CONVICTED IN A COURT OF LAW.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.577
BUT IN THE COURT
OF PUBLIC OPINION?

20:11.878 --> 20:13.913
IF WORD OF THIS GETS OUT,
WE'LL NEVER RECOVER.

20:14.013 --> 20:17.116
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A WOMAN'S LIFE,
TOMMY.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.819
MY SISTER'S.

20:19.919 --> 20:23.990
I WILL NOT
CONDEMN HER BASED ON
SUCH FLIMSY EVIDENCE.

20:29.429 --> 20:34.834
I NEED MORE THAN
JUST TWO WOMEN
SAYING MAYBE.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.490
Samson:
HIYA, SOF.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.126
BROUGHT YOU
SOMETHING.

21:00.226 --> 21:01.561
I CAN'T.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.896
AW COME ON,
YOU CAN KNOCK OFF
FOR A SPELL.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.466
WET YOUR WHISTLE.

21:10.370 --> 21:13.406
YOU KNOW THEM FELLOWS
GOT A POOL GOING?

21:16.443 --> 21:18.778
THEY THINK YOU'RE NOT
GONNA MAKE IT.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.648
THEY CAN THINK
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.450
I DON'T CARE.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.885
YOU GONNA
SHOW THEM, HUH?

21:28.421 --> 21:32.392
I'M NOT HERE
TO PROVE ANYTHING.

21:32.492 --> 21:35.395
THEN WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

21:36.529 --> 21:38.865
IT BEATS CURLING UP
AND DYING.

21:38.965 --> 21:42.369
THAT'S WHAT I'D DO IF I HAD
TO READ THOSE GODDAMN CARDS.

22:17.269 --> 22:20.106
Burley:
WHAT'S JONESY GOT
I AIN'T GOT?

22:27.614 --> 22:30.216
CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE?
HMM?

22:30.316 --> 22:35.455
NO. THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS
A RHETORICAL QUESTION.

22:36.489 --> 22:39.091
NOTHING RETARDICAL ABOUT IT.

22:40.993 --> 22:43.430
I JUST WANNA KNOW.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.133
YOU SURE?

22:49.769 --> 22:51.904
YEAH.

22:55.241 --> 22:58.010
A LIMP.

22:58.110 --> 23:00.613
WHAT MAKES YOU
SO SPECIAL, HMM?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.482
YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A WHORE.

23:02.582 --> 23:06.986
MAYBE I'LL JUST COME BY,
PAY YOU A VISIT.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.655
COME ON BY, LOVERBOY,

23:08.755 --> 23:12.625
I'LL SEND YOU HOME
WEARING YOUR DICK
LIKE A NECKTIE!

23:24.403 --> 23:27.173
I'LL BE WAITING UP,
HONEY!

23:27.273 --> 23:29.876
DON'T FORGET TO BRING
YOUR WALLET!

23:39.085 --> 23:40.920
THAT'S A LOT
OF DOUGH.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.923
YES, IT IS.

23:44.023 --> 23:46.526
YOU RECKON
HE'S DEAD?

23:47.159 --> 23:48.427
I DO.

23:48.528 --> 23:51.197
MAYBE HE'S GOT HISSELF
A GIRLFRIEND.

23:51.297 --> 23:53.466
HE GOT ME.

23:54.834 --> 23:58.805
I THINK SOMEBODY
DID HIM IN.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.740
WHO?

24:00.840 --> 24:03.810
WHO'S RUNNING
THE SHOW NOW?

24:03.910 --> 24:07.947
THAT LITTLE FELLOW?
NAW, HE WOULDN'T
HURT A FLY.

24:08.047 --> 24:10.650
PLENTY BIG ENOUGH
TO PULL A TRIGGER.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.284
NOW, WAIT,
WAIT A MINUTE.

24:12.384 --> 24:14.821
THIS HERE IS
CRAZY TALK.

24:14.921 --> 24:18.224
IT'S SOMETHING
TO THINK ABOUT.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.493
THEN AGAIN HE MIGHT
SHOW UP TOMORROW,

24:20.593 --> 24:24.030
BIG AS LIFE
AND TWICE AS ORNERY.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.365
HE'LL BE BACK.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.801
LET'S GO.

24:59.566 --> 25:01.534
TELEFONO.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.603
SI, SEÃ‘OR.

25:07.907 --> 25:10.543
I WOULD LIKE TO PLACE
A COLLECT CALL.

25:10.643 --> 25:14.581
JUSTIN CROWE,
MINTERN, CALIFORNIA.

25:14.681 --> 25:17.049
- STROUD.
- ( explosion )

25:20.486 --> 25:24.290
- ( people shouting )
- SCUDDER HAS GOT A BOY
LOOKING FOR HIM.

25:24.390 --> 25:25.892
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND HIM.

25:25.992 --> 25:29.128
Stroud:
You want me
to take care of him?

25:29.228 --> 25:32.999
NO, NO.
JUST FOLLOW HIM.

25:33.099 --> 25:36.235
THE BOY MAY LEAD YOU
TO THE MAN.

25:42.809 --> 25:45.578
Crone:
* ABIDE WITH ME

25:45.678 --> 25:49.916
* FAST FALLS
THE EVENTIDE... *

25:50.016 --> 25:53.620
( humming tune )

25:57.423 --> 25:59.158
OWEN SCUDDER.

25:59.258 --> 26:00.526
UNCLE.

26:00.627 --> 26:03.462
THERE'S
YOUR UNCLE GILBERT.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.032
AND, UH...

26:06.132 --> 26:08.334
HERE'S YOUR GRANDPA,

26:08.434 --> 26:12.939
MY DEAR,
DEAR HUSBAND HILTON.

26:15.975 --> 26:20.012
HE WAS A VERY GOOD MAN,
MY HILTON.

26:20.112 --> 26:24.216
A MIGHTY POWERFUL GRAND DRAGON
IN THESE PARTS.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.854
AND AN ELK.

26:27.954 --> 26:33.092
HE WAS A PALLBEARER
AT GENERAL NATE FORREST'S
FUNERAL.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.594
HOW ABOUT THAT?

26:36.796 --> 26:39.131
I CAN'T SAY
I KNOW WHO THAT IS.

26:39.231 --> 26:42.669
HE FOUNDED THE KLAN, BOY.

26:42.769 --> 26:45.638
HIM AND YOUR GRANDADDY,

26:45.738 --> 26:48.407
THEY HAD GREAT PLANS
FOR THIS COUNTRY,

26:48.507 --> 26:52.244
BUT HE DIED
BEFORE HIS TIME.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.480
REST HIS SOUL.

26:54.580 --> 26:55.982
THEY ALL DID.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.453
THEY ALL DIED
ON THE SAME DAY.

27:01.553 --> 27:04.123
YES, TERRIBLE THING.

27:05.524 --> 27:08.194
WHAT-- WHAT HAPPENED?

27:08.294 --> 27:10.329
THEY'RE WITH JESUS NOW.

27:10.429 --> 27:13.132
SOME KIND OF ACCIDENT?

27:13.232 --> 27:15.367
PEOPLE DIE.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.369
BEST YOU ACCEPT IT NOW, BOY.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.773
AIN'T NEVER AN ACCIDENT.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.375
( bawdy ragtime music
playing )

27:51.070 --> 27:56.943
* Folks, here's a story
'bout Minnie the Moocher *

27:57.043 --> 28:00.079
- * She was a red hot
hootchy-kootcher... *
- OH-- HEY.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.280
HI.

28:01.380 --> 28:04.516
- ( record runs down )
- I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

28:04.616 --> 28:07.820
YOUR PA SAID
THERE WAS SOME PROBLEM
WITH THE STAGE.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.722
OH, OVER THERE.

28:09.822 --> 28:12.324
ONE OF THE FLOORBOARDS
KEEPS SQUEAKING.

28:34.814 --> 28:38.217
- DON'T MIND ME.
- OH, I DON'T.

28:43.923 --> 28:49.628
* But Minnie had a heart
as big as a whale *

28:49.728 --> 28:52.631
* Hi-dee-hi-dee-
hi-dee-hi *

28:52.731 --> 28:54.834

29:07.013 --> 29:10.783
* Yeah-eh-eh-eh-eh

29:10.883 --> 29:15.788
* She messed around
with a bloke named Smoky *

29:15.888 --> 29:20.960
* She loved him
though he was cokey *

29:21.060 --> 29:24.730
* He took her down
to Chinatown *

29:24.831 --> 29:27.766
* And he showed her
how to kick *

29:27.867 --> 29:29.201
* The gong around

29:29.301 --> 29:32.171
* Hi-dee-hi-dee-

- * Oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh...
- Rita Sue: LIB!

29:38.710 --> 29:42.815
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
MR. JONES TO DO HIS WORK
WHILE YOU'RE PRANCING AROUND?

29:42.915 --> 29:47.019
JUST A LOOSE FLOORBOARD.
BE DONE IN A JIFFY.

29:50.322 --> 29:54.493
* She had a dream
about the King of Sweden *

29:54.593 --> 29:59.498
* He gave her things
that she was needin' *

29:59.598 --> 30:04.170
* He gave her a home
built of gold and steel *

30:04.270 --> 30:07.706
* A diamond car
with big platinum wheels... *

30:07.806 --> 30:09.641
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.

30:09.741 --> 30:11.610
* Hi-dee-hi-dee-
hi-dee-hi *

30:11.710 --> 30:13.579

and his racing horses *

30:30.162 --> 30:35.201
- * Each meal she ate
was a dozen-- *

30:37.904 --> 30:39.872
THAT SONG DON'T
WORK FOR ME.

30:39.972 --> 30:42.374
I LIKE IT.

30:42.474 --> 30:46.512
MATTER OF FACT,
I THOUGHT IT WORKED
REAL WELL.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.981
TAKE A LESSON
FROM ME, GIRL,

30:49.081 --> 30:50.649
DON'T FUCK WHERE YOU EAT.

30:50.749 --> 30:53.352
I AIN'T YOU, MAMA.

31:12.905 --> 31:15.341

31:47.239 --> 31:48.674
OH, SHIT.

Justin:
FRIENDS, I COME
BEFORE YOU TODAY

32:35.187 --> 32:38.557
DEEPLY MOVED
BY YOUR PRESENCE HERE.

32:44.030 --> 32:47.066
THERE IS A DARK LIE

32:47.166 --> 32:49.635
FESTERING IN THE HEART
OF OUR NATION TODAY.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.937
( audience agreeing )

32:52.038 --> 32:54.306
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS
ARTICULATED

32:54.406 --> 32:58.377
THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS
OF EVERY TRUE AMERICAN:

32:58.477 --> 33:01.213
- LIBERTY...
- THAT'S RIGHT!

33:01.313 --> 33:03.615
- EQUALITY...
- Woman: YES!

33:03.715 --> 33:07.619
- AND THE RIGHT
TO PURSUE HAPPINESS.
- ( crowd cheering )

33:09.121 --> 33:12.258
AND YET,
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY

33:12.358 --> 33:15.594
WE LOST
THOSE GLORIOUS TRUTHS.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.163
Man:
HALLELUJAH!

33:17.263 --> 33:19.665
Justin:
WE HAVE ALL BEEN LED
TO BELIEVE

33:19.765 --> 33:23.169
THAT THROUGH HONEST LABOR,
INDUSTRY AND OPTIMISM

33:23.269 --> 33:27.173
WE CAN ACHIEVE SUCCESS
AND ENJOY PROSPERITY.

33:27.273 --> 33:29.175
( crowd murmuring )

33:29.275 --> 33:32.678
BUT WHAT OF YOU? WHAT OF YOU,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

33:32.778 --> 33:37.716
WHO HAVE WORKED SO HARD,
TOILING AND TENDING THE LAND,

33:37.816 --> 33:39.885
ONLY TO SEE IT
SNATCHED AWAY?

33:39.985 --> 33:42.054
( agreeing )

33:42.154 --> 33:45.791
NOT BY GOD,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

33:45.891 --> 33:48.294
BUT BY MAN!

33:49.161 --> 33:50.662
BY THE BANKS.

33:50.762 --> 33:51.863
Audience:
YES!

33:51.963 --> 33:55.601
BY THE CRAVEN MEN
WHO RUN THE BANKS!

33:59.738 --> 34:01.773
THESE MEN...

34:01.873 --> 34:05.077
THESE MONEY-CHANGERS...

34:05.177 --> 34:07.946
THEY HAVE FEASTED
FOR CENTURIES

34:08.046 --> 34:10.048
ON THE FATTED COW
THAT WAS EUROPE.

34:10.149 --> 34:14.486
AND NOW THAT THE HEARTLAND
OF OUR NATION IS TRANSFORMED
INTO A DESERT,

34:14.586 --> 34:16.255
THEY TURN
THEIR GLUTTONOUS EYE

34:16.355 --> 34:21.160
UPON OUR MISERY
AND THEY GOBBLE UP
YOUR FARMS!

34:30.102 --> 34:32.271
HOW DO YOU DO THIS
WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE?

34:32.371 --> 34:34.906
Crone:
I DON'T HAVE EYES.

34:35.006 --> 34:37.976
THAT DON'T MEAN
I CAN'T SEE.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.911
IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

34:40.011 --> 34:42.414
( Crone muttering )

34:43.815 --> 34:45.417
WHAT IS IT?

34:45.517 --> 34:48.454
A SURPRISE.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.094
( chuckling )

35:09.541 --> 35:12.878
- WHAT IS THIS?
- WHAT?

35:15.214 --> 35:19.218
SOME KIND OF...
SOME KIND OF MASK.

35:21.253 --> 35:24.156
THAT'S MY HENRY'S
DEATH-MASK.

35:32.130 --> 35:35.501
HE'S DEAD?

35:40.172 --> 35:41.707
WHAT'VE YOU DONE?

35:41.807 --> 35:44.142
THIS WHOLE DAY
YOU DIDN'T SAY
HE WAS DEAD.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.811
YOU BROKE IT.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.347
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

35:49.515 --> 35:53.685
THERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.854
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

35:57.323 --> 36:00.292
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

36:05.197 --> 36:07.333
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

36:07.433 --> 36:10.969
SOMETHING YOUR DADDY
LEFT FOR YOU.

36:11.069 --> 36:13.872
SOMETHING REAL PRETTY.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.674
I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU,

36:15.774 --> 36:18.877
ONLY YOU GOTTA CLOSE
YOUR EYES FIRST.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.548
CLOSE THEM.

36:22.648 --> 36:25.284
THEY'RE CLOSED.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.819
NO, THEY'RE NOT.

36:34.226 --> 36:36.695
NO PEEKING.

36:51.777 --> 36:54.045
CAN I LOOK NOW?

36:54.145 --> 36:56.448
YES.

36:59.485 --> 37:03.121
HE WANTED YOU TO HAVE IT.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.991
YOU'LL NEED IT
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.727
WHERE AM I GOING?

37:08.827 --> 37:14.433
WHERE THE DOG AND THE WOLF
HOWL AT THE MOON.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.570
WHERE'S THAT AT?

37:18.670 --> 37:21.239
YOU'LL SEE.

37:26.244 --> 37:30.749
AND WHAT OF THE FRUITS
OF OUR LABOR, BROTHERS
AND SISTERS?

37:30.849 --> 37:32.718
ASHES AND DUST,

37:32.818 --> 37:37.122
AND A PITIFUL ALPHABET SOUP
OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS.

37:37.222 --> 37:39.691
THE N.R.A.!

37:39.791 --> 37:41.893
THE W.P.A.!

37:41.993 --> 37:45.731
IS THIS OUR AMERICAN DREAM?

37:52.003 --> 37:54.773

37:55.941 --> 37:58.310
JUSTIN! GET AWAY!

I'M FINE.

38:32.177 --> 38:35.414
I'M JUST OVERLY TIRED,
THAT'S ALL.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.952
JUSTIN...

38:43.321 --> 38:46.858
WHY DID YOU SAY,
"HE MEANS TO KILL ME"?

38:47.893 --> 38:49.895
WHO IS IT?

38:49.995 --> 38:52.698
YOU LOOK TIRED,
MY DEAR.

38:55.367 --> 38:59.104
IF YOU ARE IN DANGER,
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

38:59.204 --> 39:01.272
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS SAYING.

39:01.373 --> 39:04.543
JUSTIN,
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
HEAR YOU EVERY WEEK.

39:04.643 --> 39:09.448
SOME OF THEM ARE
BOUND TO BE UNBALANCED.

39:09.548 --> 39:14.252
YOU'VE
BEEN THREATENED,
I HAVE TO KNOW.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.522
MY ONLY ENEMY IS TIME.

39:16.622 --> 39:18.424
THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO.

39:18.524 --> 39:20.926
- THEN LET ME HELP YOU.
- YOU DO HELP ME, DEAR.

39:21.026 --> 39:24.295
THE WAY YOU'VE ORGANIZED
THE VOLUNTEERS.
I'VE SEEN HOW--

39:24.396 --> 39:26.364
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN!

39:26.465 --> 39:28.667
I CAN PROTECT YOU,

39:28.767 --> 39:32.571
BUT NOT IF
THERE ARE THINGS
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

39:35.841 --> 39:39.878
THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS
I'M NOT PRIVY TO.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.180
NOTHING OF SIGNIFICANCE.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.684
I'VE SEEN YOU AND TOMMY
WHISPERING BEHIND
CLOSED DOORS.

39:45.784 --> 39:49.555
WE NEVER HAD SECRETS
BETWEEN US, ALEXSEI.

39:50.622 --> 39:52.891
TOMMY IS NO THREAT TO YOU.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.894
HE DOES WHAT HE'S TOLD.

39:58.597 --> 40:03.835
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'VE OPENED UP
THIS DOOR, JUSTIN.

40:03.935 --> 40:07.906
THIS DOOR WAS
ALREADY OPEN, IRIS.

40:10.275 --> 40:12.711
IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO ME,

40:12.811 --> 40:15.914
IT WILL BE ON
YOUR HEAD AS WELL.

40:17.449 --> 40:20.519
I WILL NOT BE SACRIFICED!

40:32.330 --> 40:34.766
( monkey chattering )

40:36.502 --> 40:39.538
HAVE A NICE VISIT?

40:41.006 --> 40:43.208
DON'T PLAY WITH IT.

40:43.308 --> 40:46.077
I'M LEAVING NOW.

40:53.885 --> 40:57.556
WHY Y'ALL KEEP HER
LIKE THAT?

40:57.656 --> 40:59.691
LOCKED UP LIKE
SOME KIND OF ANIMAL.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.894
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, SON,

41:02.994 --> 41:06.932
THAT OLD GAL CRAZY AS
A SHITHOUSE RAT.

41:07.032 --> 41:09.668
Ern:
IT'S TRUE.

41:09.768 --> 41:12.037
THE NIGHT YOUR DADDY
WAS BORN,

41:12.137 --> 41:14.673
SHE WENT AND GOT HERSELF
A BONING KNIFE,

41:14.773 --> 41:16.975
KILLED EVERY LAST ONE
OF THEM.

41:17.075 --> 41:19.044
GRANDPA HILTON,

41:19.144 --> 41:22.247
UNCLE OWEN,
GILBERT,

41:22.347 --> 41:24.683
ALVIN SR.

41:25.717 --> 41:28.253
SHE WENT BED TO BED...

41:30.021 --> 41:32.758
SLIT THEIR THROATS.

41:34.125 --> 41:35.661
DO YOU KNOW

41:35.761 --> 41:39.998
HOW MUCH BLOOD
A MAN HAS IN HIM?

41:40.098 --> 41:44.269
AFTER SHE WAS DONE,
SHE CLAWED HER EYES OUT.

41:44.369 --> 41:46.872
IN THE MORNING,
THEY FOUND HER
IN THE KITCHEN,

41:46.972 --> 41:49.541
SITTING THERE
AND SINGING.

41:49.641 --> 41:51.209
"ABIDE WITH ME."

41:51.309 --> 41:55.614
Young girl:
* ABIDE WITH ME

41:55.714 --> 42:00.686
- * FAST FALLS THE--
- SHUT UP. JUST SHUT UP!

42:06.658 --> 42:08.694
THAT'S MINE.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.674
YOU COME BACK
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

42:22.774 --> 42:26.144
ALWAYS ROOM FOR KIN
AT THE TABLE.

42:38.690 --> 42:41.059
( mumbles )

43:07.686 --> 43:10.622
( digging )

43:19.364 --> 43:21.933
THAT'LL DO.

43:24.169 --> 43:26.271
I SAID
THAT'LL DO.

43:26.371 --> 43:28.807
I'M NOT DONE.

43:34.245 --> 43:37.082
YEAH, YOU ARE.

43:37.182 --> 43:40.318
GOD DAMN IT, SOFIE.
WHY'RE YOU DOING THIS?

43:40.418 --> 43:41.687
IT'S MY JOB.

43:41.787 --> 43:43.454
THERE'S LOTS
OF OTHER JOBS.

43:43.554 --> 43:45.156
I LIKE THIS ONE.

43:45.256 --> 43:47.325
IT AIN'T
ABOUT THE JOB.

43:47.425 --> 43:50.495
- YOU KNOW THAT.
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT IT'S ABOUT?

43:50.595 --> 43:54.866
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ABOUT YOU AND ME
AND GODDAMN RITA SUE,

43:54.966 --> 43:58.236
AND WHAT ALL HAPPENED
THAT NIGHT WITH LIBBY.

44:00.806 --> 44:04.342
- WELL, AIN'T IT?
- NO.

44:06.177 --> 44:08.346
IT ISN'T.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.684
SOF, LOOK AT WHAT
YOU'RE DOING TO YOURSELF!

44:12.784 --> 44:16.354
YOUR FACE IS BURNT
AND YOUR HANDS ARE RAW.

44:16.454 --> 44:18.757
YOUR LIPS ARE BLEEDING.

44:19.925 --> 44:22.227
YOU'RE HURTING YOURSELF.

44:22.327 --> 44:24.229
I DON'T CARE.

44:24.329 --> 44:27.098
I WANT TO WORK.

44:27.966 --> 44:29.367
I WANNA WORK SO HARD

44:29.467 --> 44:32.871
THAT THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
LEFT OF ME BUT THE WORK.

44:37.876 --> 44:41.679
SHE TRIED TO KILL ME,
JONESY.

44:42.948 --> 44:45.383
SHE SET THE FIRE.

44:45.483 --> 44:48.119
AND SHE WAS HOLDING ME.
SHE WOULDN'T LET ME GO.

44:48.219 --> 44:51.790
YOU SAW.

44:51.890 --> 44:55.226
- SHE WAS JUST SCARED.
- NO.

44:56.862 --> 44:59.397
SHE WANTED US TO DIE.

45:00.365 --> 45:04.169
SHE WANTED ME TO DIE.

45:04.269 --> 45:08.239
WHAT DID I DO TO MAKE HER
HATE ME SO MUCH?

45:10.608 --> 45:13.711
NOTHING DESERVES THAT.

45:34.165 --> 45:35.834
Stumpy:
HELLO THERE, GENTLEMEN!

45:35.934 --> 45:38.837
COME ON DOWN
TO THE BALD-HEADED ROW,
GENTLEMEN!

45:38.937 --> 45:41.639
MOVE UP HERE, BOY.
YES, SIR!

45:41.739 --> 45:45.376
IT'S LUAU TIME DOWN
UP IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC,

45:45.476 --> 45:48.713
WHERE YOU CAN TASTE
THE COCONUT MEAT, BOYS.

45:48.814 --> 45:50.581
RAWR!

45:50.681 --> 45:56.587
YES, AND MARVEL AT THE BEAUTY
OF HAWAII'S MILKY MOUNTAINS!

45:56.687 --> 45:58.423
( Stumpy laughing )

45:58.523 --> 46:00.826
YES, SIR, GENTLEMEN.

46:03.161 --> 46:05.663
BE CAREFUL
OF THE ERUPTIONS, BOYS.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.265
BE CAREFUL
OF THE ERUPTIONS, BOYS!

46:07.365 --> 46:12.938
BECAUSE WHEN
THE VOLCANO BLOWS,
THE LAVA FLOWS!

46:15.841 --> 46:18.709
YES, SIR. YES, SIR.

46:18.810 --> 46:20.979
COME UP BACK,
GATHER AROUND HERE, BOYS.

46:21.079 --> 46:24.615
COME ON DOWN.
COME ON DOWN INSIDE,
GENTLEMEN.

46:24.715 --> 46:28.086
COME ON AROUND, BOYS.
COME ON DOWN,

46:28.186 --> 46:31.589
BECAUSE INSIDE
IT'S PARADISE FOUND.

46:31.689 --> 46:34.059
( hula music playing )

46:48.439 --> 46:50.341
( brakes squeal )

46:57.482 --> 46:59.517
( door slams )

47:00.351 --> 47:02.888
HE'S DEAD.

47:05.924 --> 47:08.359
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID,
GOD DAMN IT?

47:08.459 --> 47:09.627
SCUDDER'S DEAD!

47:09.727 --> 47:11.829
DID THE CRONE
TELL YOU THAT?

47:11.930 --> 47:13.664
YEAH, SO WHAT
IF SHE DID?

47:13.764 --> 47:17.402
HE'S GONE, GOD DAMN IT!
HE TOOK THE PREACHER'S NAME
WITH HIM!

47:17.502 --> 47:19.537
HE'S NOT DEAD.

47:19.637 --> 47:23.141
OF THAT I AM CERTAIN.

47:23.241 --> 47:26.611
I SAW HIS DEATH-MASK.
I HELD IT IN MY HANDS!

47:26.711 --> 47:28.713
NO, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

47:28.813 --> 47:30.548
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

47:30.648 --> 47:33.551
YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
PAST YOUR OWN HATE,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

47:33.651 --> 47:37.022
BECAUSE IF SCUDDER'S DEAD,
YOU GOT NO REASON
TO A DRAW BREATH!

47:37.122 --> 47:41.326
I WILL DIE,
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
BEN HAWKINS.

47:41.426 --> 47:46.431
IT'S YOU WHO HAS
SOMETHING GREATER
AT STAKE.

48:36.447 --> 48:38.883
Ben:
SOFIE.

48:38.984 --> 48:41.519
YOU REMEMBER THEM CARDS
YOU HAD ME BURN UP?

48:43.454 --> 48:46.157
SOFIE, PLEASE.

48:46.257 --> 48:48.626
I NEED TO KNOW
SOMETHING.

50:24.922 --> 50:26.491
( gun cocks )

50:26.591 --> 50:29.527
YOU STAND STILL,
YOU PIECE OF SHIT,
OR I'LL KILL YOU.

50:30.628 --> 50:31.929
( sighs )

50:32.029 --> 50:35.133
- JESUS!
- STUMPY!
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

50:35.233 --> 50:37.802
ME?
I'M JUST GETTIN'
READY FOR BED.

50:37.902 --> 50:40.138
MAMA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

50:40.238 --> 50:43.741
NOTHING, BABY.
I THOUGHT YOUR DADDY
WAS SOMEBODY ELSE.

50:43.841 --> 50:46.010
GOD...

50:46.111 --> 50:49.046
DAMN.

50:54.785 --> 50:57.322
( laughing )

51:00.425 --> 51:03.294
THAT'S MY PISTOL-PACKIN' MAMA.

51:12.703 --> 51:15.640
I'VE GOT TO SAY...

51:15.740 --> 51:17.775
THAT WAS
KIND OF EXCITING.

51:17.875 --> 51:20.778
UGH, YOU'RE STINKO!

51:28.286 --> 51:30.821
Burley:
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

51:33.424 --> 51:37.195
YOU ALL OUT
OF DICKS TO SUCK?

51:37.295 --> 51:39.697
- WHAT?
- ( laughing )

51:44.034 --> 51:46.437
( laughing )

51:54.912 --> 51:57.615
( sniffling )

53:28.172 --> 53:29.940
OH, I'M SORRY.

53:30.040 --> 53:33.744
- I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYONE WAS HERE.
- QUITE ALL RIGHT, MY DEAR.

53:33.844 --> 53:36.481
I WAS JUST FINISHING UP.

53:37.815 --> 53:38.983
( sighs )

53:39.083 --> 53:41.652
YOU MUST BE THE NEW GIRL.

53:58.769 --> 54:00.805
YOU'RE AWAKE.

54:00.905 --> 54:03.274
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

54:09.780 --> 54:11.882
I'M SORRY.

54:13.083 --> 54:16.554
I JUST CAN'T.

54:24.028 --> 54:26.364
IT DON'T MATTER.

55:13.978 --> 55:16.881
( theme music playing )
