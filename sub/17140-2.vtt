WEBVTT

01:45.939 --> 01:47.741
All right, McBride.

01:49.910 --> 01:50.878
You're out.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.413
Okay. Excellent.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.053
I'm running a little behind.

02:00.188 --> 02:03.857
I'm gonna trust that you didn't
screw me on my shit here, okay?

02:36.224 --> 02:38.326
The judge dismissed it,
Mr. McBride.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.860
You missed it.

03:06.254 --> 03:10.691
You gotta be shitting me.
What the fuck happened?

03:10.758 --> 03:13.394
- What happened to my car?
- Came in that way.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.763
Oh, bullshit.
It didn't come in
in that way.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.965
My goddamn windshield
wasn't broken.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.633
The fuckin' headlight
wasn't out.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.035
Look at this shit.
There's fuckin' dents in it.

03:22.102 --> 03:23.837
What's going on here, huh?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.973
Look. Sign the form.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.560
How's your bite feeling?
You go to the doctor yet?

03:46.627 --> 03:51.299
I'm fine, Dad.
Really, it didn't
even hurt that bad.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.869
Mom wasn't too excited
about the whole thing, though.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.641
Look, I just don't want you
walking around

04:00.708 --> 04:03.611
thinking it was my fault at all,
because you saw the guy--

04:03.677 --> 04:06.314
- Dad, please don't.
- You saw the son of a bitch.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.848
Don't.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.850
How about your mom?
What is she saying?

04:09.917 --> 04:11.785
Don't do that, either.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.887
I don't know.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.424
I'm just sorry the whole
thing happened, honey.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.329
Okay.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.966
So we're good?

04:32.172 --> 04:33.907
Yeah, Dad.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.009
We're good.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.916
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.555
Get your shit together.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.444
No housekeeping today, okay?

06:57.518 --> 07:01.288
- I said no housekeeping!
- What, you couldn't call me?

07:01.354 --> 07:02.990
You couldn't let me know
what's going on?

07:03.056 --> 07:04.858
If I had known
that you'd been arrested,

07:04.925 --> 07:07.495
I could have done something!
I could have moved the hearing!

07:07.561 --> 07:10.531
You get one call, man!
And you can't fucking use it?

07:10.598 --> 07:11.965
Could you keep your fucking
voice down?

07:12.032 --> 07:13.834
Fuck you,
keep you voice down!

07:13.901 --> 07:16.103
There's no law that says
they gotta give me a phone call.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.972
I was resisting arrest.
They ain't got do me
no favors.

07:19.039 --> 07:22.075
- How drunk were you?
- Not at all!

07:22.142 --> 07:25.145
I haven't really had a drink
in three days.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.981
- Where's Rachel?
- What do you care?
You fuck her.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.551
And you don't show up
for her case.

07:30.618 --> 07:33.086
You're fucked up
and you're sick.

07:33.153 --> 07:36.223
And you made me look like
a fucking idiot!

07:36.289 --> 07:38.792
I'm coming up
with a plan to fix it,
'cause I actually do care.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.728
Oh, I understand.
I understand.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.430
Because you're gonna fucking
fix it, 'cause I tell you what.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.798
I didn't get to where I am

07:44.865 --> 07:47.234
by letting assholes like you
drag me down.

07:47.300 --> 07:51.371
Where you are?
You got a one-woman shop
in fuckin' Van Nuys, honey.

07:51.438 --> 07:52.973
Fix it!

07:53.040 --> 07:56.209
Or I swear to fucking God--
I swear to God--

07:56.276 --> 07:59.547
I'm gonna make your life
shittier than it is now.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.348
Believe it or fuckin' not.

08:01.414 --> 08:04.652
You'd have to be
a goddamn magician to do that.

08:14.161 --> 08:18.165
- Malicious prosecution.
- Malicious prosecution?

08:18.231 --> 08:19.633
For starters.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.570
And anything else
you can think of.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.137
Okay. First of all,

08:24.204 --> 08:27.941
I don't think that failure
to show up at a court date

08:28.008 --> 08:29.409
constitute--

08:29.476 --> 08:32.212
The case is dead, Donald.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.181
It's dismissed.

08:34.247 --> 08:37.150
Be a gracious one,
and let's just let
sleeping dogs lie.

08:37.217 --> 08:40.821
Some dogs refuse to lie.
Some dogs you have to hit,

08:40.888 --> 08:43.090
kick while they're down,

08:43.156 --> 08:45.593
in order to ensure
they stay down.

08:45.593 --> 08:48.461
I've known Billy longer
than any of you,

08:48.596 --> 08:50.598
longer even than you.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.633
I know what he's capable of.

08:52.700 --> 08:56.670
For good and ill.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.106
He's a moral leper.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.674
Billy created this firm.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.745
I created this firm.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.980
That's why my name is first.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.283
The point is, whatever
your feelings are for Billy--

09:10.350 --> 09:13.621
My feelings are not in play,
Michelle.

09:13.621 --> 09:16.724
Are yours?

09:16.790 --> 09:18.792
I don't want any claim filed.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.928
If you file a claim,

09:20.994 --> 09:22.663
then I have to report it
back to Borns Tech

09:22.730 --> 09:24.031
where I will be met with "why."

09:24.097 --> 09:26.834
It is not a satisfactory
response on my part

09:26.900 --> 09:29.536
to say I have no fucking idea.

09:29.637 --> 09:34.141
If they ask you why...

09:34.207 --> 09:37.177
you just tell them
because I said so.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.756
- Listen, please.
- No.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.491
- Hear me out.
- Mm-hmm.

10:24.557 --> 10:27.194
I gotta a plan.
We're gonna go back
to state court.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.096
I'm gonna get
the hearing rescheduled.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.965
And then at the same time,
Rachel-- Listen!

10:32.032 --> 10:33.967
I'm gonna file in federal court

10:34.034 --> 10:35.769
with an entirely different
theory.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.337
Now, if none of that works,

10:37.404 --> 10:38.538
you just sue me for malpractice.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.907
I got professional insurance.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.274
I'll go along with
whatever you say.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.910
And then you get something
for your case.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.478
- You think I did this
for money?
- No.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.314
I'm making money
off my dead brother?

10:47.380 --> 10:50.183
That's not what I'm saying!
Hang on a second! Please!

10:50.250 --> 10:52.720
I never missed a court date
in my lifetime.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.221
- Bullshit.
- That's not bullshit.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.123
- I don't believe you.
- I always made it.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.858
Maybe I was
in bad shape sometimes,

10:57.925 --> 10:59.727
but I always answered
the fucking bell, Rachel.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.062
And as far as-- Look.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.765
I also--

11:04.832 --> 11:07.467
There's this guy--

11:07.534 --> 11:11.204
There's this guy that's been
following me around. Okay?

11:11.271 --> 11:14.641
I've seen him three times.
The first time was at the bar.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.209
He's glaring at me
at everything.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.112
At first, I thought he was
just some fucking asshole.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.382
But then, sure enough,
he's outside,
he's taking pictures.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.985
I'm with my kid.
He's creeping around
out there all night.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.820
And last night,
he was in my cell.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.222
There's gotta be something
to it.

11:29.289 --> 11:32.392
It's gotta have something
to do with the case.
I know it does.

11:32.459 --> 11:35.595
- We got something--
- You need more help than I do.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.197
Rachel?

12:07.795 --> 12:10.063
Hey! Idiota! Quit it.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.498
Fucking seals won't
go away, man.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.933
I fucking hate seals.

12:15.803 --> 12:16.804
What's up, man?

12:16.870 --> 12:18.705
Oh, no. No.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.140
Get the fuck outta here.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.809
We don't need anything
from you.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.610
I'm not here to see you.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.445
I'm here to see him.

12:30.383 --> 12:34.154
I told you, man.
He isn't against moving shit.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.156
It's just that
he don't know you.

12:36.223 --> 12:40.193
You know how many guys
out there would be willing
to make this deal?

12:43.496 --> 12:48.035
It's not my boat, man.
It's my brother's boat.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.470
Can't blame him, either.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.006
How do we know you're
not some kind of cop?

12:56.977 --> 13:01.048
Just show up here
with this deal out of nowhere?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.416
Dude, we don't know you.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.019
My brother's careful.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.454
He's got his wife.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.857
Got kids.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.059
He's actually kind of
a pussy now.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.865
If you don't handle deals
like this,

13:17.865 --> 13:21.368
why do you have a guy like
Billy McBride working for you?

13:23.470 --> 13:26.106
- Who?
- He's a lawyer.

13:26.173 --> 13:30.077
He's the one who told me
you guys would be open
for this deal.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.279
He's a drug lawyer.
He's big.

13:35.082 --> 13:38.018
I don't know any lawyers, man.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.554
Don't bullshit me.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.156
I met the guy one time.

13:43.223 --> 13:46.093
He came by here and wanted
to talk about an accident

13:46.159 --> 13:47.360
we had on our old boat.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.528
That's it.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.599
Okay.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.904
What'd you tell him?

13:59.172 --> 14:02.976
Woman: That was the last
time I spoke to her.

14:03.043 --> 14:07.380
Man: That was very brave.
Thank you, Candace.

14:07.447 --> 14:10.050
Is there anyone else
that would like to speak?

14:15.322 --> 14:17.925
I recognize some of you
from the old days

14:17.925 --> 14:19.559
when I used to come
to this meeting.

14:21.929 --> 14:26.499
I figured I'd either die
or come back when I hit
rock bottom,

14:26.566 --> 14:28.268
which I did a few times.

14:30.103 --> 14:33.706
But I just kept redefining
what rock bottom is.

14:33.773 --> 14:36.176
Kind of like God's little acre.

14:37.945 --> 14:41.348
Maybe that's a little obscure
for some of you younger folks.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.955
And recently I had
a pretty good chance

14:47.955 --> 14:50.790
to come back.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.693
I got some decent work.

14:53.760 --> 14:59.132
Got a girl that would
half-assed tolerate me.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.968
But I fucked it up.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.607
You know, aren't you all
tired of saying

15:07.674 --> 15:10.443
the same shit over and
over at these meetings?

15:11.678 --> 15:16.283
I know I'm tired of hearing it.

15:16.349 --> 15:20.387
Truth is, I wanna get my shit
together for my daughter's sake.

15:22.990 --> 15:26.359
And I wanna get back to being
somebody that people can trust.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.999
So that's kind of my deal.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.175
- Hey, Alma, you got a sec?
- No.

15:42.242 --> 15:46.013
Listen, I wanna apologize
to you for missing
the court date.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.880
Don't talk to me,
Mr. McBride.

15:48.015 --> 15:50.317
- Listen, I need a favor.
- You're not getting one.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.219
I gotta go back
in front of Keller.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.587
He's not gonna like it,
but you gotta do this for me.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.489
No.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.425
I'm calling on you
for a favor,

15:58.491 --> 16:00.927
and you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.663
- You gonna do it or not?
- Or what?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.065
Are you threatening me?

16:05.132 --> 16:08.668
I don't wanna have to,
but I will.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.414
- After you.
- Thanks.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.051
Okay, so just a recap.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.585
Great freeway, access.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.853
- Right?
- Right.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.055
And you saw the light inside.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.422
Gorgeous.

16:29.489 --> 16:33.060
And the public schools
are on the up.

16:33.126 --> 16:37.764
Excuse me for one--
No. Nope. Nope. No.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.266
This is a shown by-- No.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.069
What? Did you fix it?
If not, fuck off.

16:42.135 --> 16:45.105
Not yet. But I filed a new case
in federal court

16:45.172 --> 16:47.407
based on the death
on the High Seas Act.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.776
- High sea what?
- I'll explain it to you.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.744
Look, I just need you
to help me get Rachel back.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.081
- I've been trying
and it ain't working.
- Right.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.782
Well, I don't blame her. Hey!

16:55.848 --> 16:57.484
Why don't you guys go inside,
have another look around,

16:57.550 --> 17:00.087
and I'll be right in, okay?
Okay.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.888
I'm trying to make amends here.

17:01.954 --> 17:04.157
If you want me to apologize to
you too, I will. I'm sorry.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.725
I don't accept.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.827
I've been having
kind of a rough time.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.329
I need a little help.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.364
Oh, so you're the victim?
Is that right?

17:11.431 --> 17:14.401
Look, I know all about guys
like you.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.537
I've married two of them,
and...

17:21.174 --> 17:22.909
Forget it.

17:22.975 --> 17:24.977
I'll figure out a way to get
the case reheard without you.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.413
Patty--

17:28.315 --> 17:30.250
We can do this.
I guarantee you.

17:30.317 --> 17:33.786
I just need you
to help me get Rachel back.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.558
Fine.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.560
- I'll be right here.
- Whatever.

17:44.331 --> 17:47.134
Cooperman asked for me again?

17:47.167 --> 17:48.168
Why?

17:48.235 --> 17:50.036
Seems he's a fan.

17:50.137 --> 17:52.172
Malicious prosecution...

17:52.239 --> 17:54.541
and whatever else
you can throw at them.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.943
Billy's just tried to resurrect
the case in federal court

17:57.009 --> 17:59.011
under the High Seas Act.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.714
So, while you're at it, you can
draft a response to that,

18:01.781 --> 18:03.650
as well as the motion
to dismiss,

18:03.716 --> 18:05.285
and we'd like it all
by the end of business.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.987
- Okay.
- Really?

18:08.054 --> 18:10.790
'Cause you look a little bit
like a deer in the headlights.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.163
It's just that...

18:16.196 --> 18:20.300
I've never even seen the man.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.437
Well, it seems
you're on his radar.

18:24.504 --> 18:28.608
Which could either be
very good or very bad.

18:28.675 --> 18:33.380
Donald hates Billy McBride
more than any human
on the earth.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.749
And Donald is one of life's
truly magnificent haters.

18:36.816 --> 18:41.788
Just imagine how happy
he would be if you help bury
his biggest enemy.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.891
End of business.

19:50.089 --> 19:54.361
Best way not to get a DUI is
to drink at home.

19:55.795 --> 19:58.898
- I was set up, Frankie, okay?
- Why?

19:58.965 --> 20:01.834
I don't know.
I'm still trying
to figure that out.

20:04.704 --> 20:08.941
Hey, I need you to stop
calling me, okay?

20:10.410 --> 20:12.379
What are you talking about?

20:12.445 --> 20:15.648
I'm talking about calling me
and hanging up like
a teenage boy.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.752
I called you a couple
of times.

20:19.819 --> 20:23.623
I left a message,
but I didn't hang up on you.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.326
Really? You didn't call me
and hang up? It wasn't you.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.861
No. I swear to God.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.398
Did you hope it was?
Tell the truth.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.665
Hmm.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.171
I'll stay for one second.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.374
- Federal court.
- Yeah.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.743
- You think we can win?
- I know we can.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.779
Okay.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.451
Hey, look, I'm sorry
about coming over there

20:51.518 --> 20:53.753
and acting like some tweaker
or something.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.322
It's okay.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.657
If I didn't give a shit,

20:57.724 --> 21:02.194
- I'd just give it up, you know?
- I know.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.764
Your face okay?

21:04.831 --> 21:05.865
Yeah, it's fine.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.567
I'm lying. It sucks.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.869
That feels like shit.

21:09.936 --> 21:13.172
I mean, the sleep apnea
and everything

21:13.239 --> 21:15.342
- and the busted nose--
- Not good.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.909
- Bad combination.
- Not good.

21:19.446 --> 21:22.014
This thing, um--

21:22.081 --> 21:25.752
This thing we did together,

21:25.818 --> 21:27.219
you and me--

21:27.354 --> 21:29.889
- Sex?
- Yeah.

21:31.424 --> 21:35.762
If we're gonna be back
in business here,

21:35.828 --> 21:37.930
probably should shy away
from that.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.832
Yeah. Totally.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.668
Understood.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.436
I agree.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.039
It was kind of fun, though,
wasn't it?

22:16.669 --> 22:18.838
- Hurt?
- No, it's okay.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.877
- Thanks for doing this.
- Yeah.

22:28.415 --> 22:29.849
God, I'm being followed,

22:29.916 --> 22:32.785
and you're having people
hang up on you.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.454
It just, um--

22:36.022 --> 22:39.859
I've never been stalked.

22:39.926 --> 22:40.927
Yeah.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.831
Me neither.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.300
You think it's the case?

22:48.435 --> 22:50.603
I can't imagine it's not.

23:03.249 --> 23:04.884
You're a sweet guy.

23:08.287 --> 23:10.122
- You are.
- Come on.

23:15.795 --> 23:22.669
Patty said that juries
used to love you.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.136
But what happened?

23:27.474 --> 23:29.476
She's right. They did.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.177
Juries loved me.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.279
And I loved them, too.

23:33.345 --> 23:34.647
That's the secret.

23:36.483 --> 23:40.286
At one point,
they loved me so much,
I could do anything I wanted,

23:40.352 --> 23:41.621
just about, yeah.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.158
But that can be dangerous.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.101
I won't say anything
if you don't.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.605
I won't say a word.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.285
Have you actually met him?

24:13.352 --> 24:15.888
No, but maybe I will.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.824
Has anybody ever seen Cooperman?

24:17.890 --> 24:19.892
He won't let himself be seen.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.662
Supposedly,
half his face is burnt off.

24:22.729 --> 24:23.996
Some injury in Vietnam.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.699
He sits in a dark room
all day.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.301
I heard he has hepatitis
and light sensitivity.

24:29.368 --> 24:31.671
I heard the partners make him
stay in the room,

24:31.738 --> 24:32.972
because he's out of his mind.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.775
And it was Billy McBride
who drove him nuts.

24:35.842 --> 24:38.711
I even heard it was McBride
who lit his face on fire,

24:38.778 --> 24:40.580
and they made up
the whole Vietnam story.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.114
That's definitely not true.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.717
Yeah, Luce, you gotta take a
picture if you ever meet him.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.586
Oh, yeah,
I'm gonna whip out my phone

24:46.653 --> 24:48.688
and send you a Snapchat?

24:48.755 --> 24:50.723
Don't worry.
That's never going to happen,

24:50.790 --> 24:52.859
because he does not exist.

24:52.925 --> 24:57.429
You know who doesn't exist,
Sumi? You.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.632
In fact, none of you exist.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.636
Unless we count flecks.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.638
We don't count flecks.

25:05.705 --> 25:06.906
Specks, we count.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.474
Lucy, here,
has clawed her way up

25:08.575 --> 25:12.579
from being a fleck
to a little speck.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.647
Did you file the answer
in federal court?

25:14.714 --> 25:17.483
- Yeah, last night.
- Good.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.018
Flecks.

25:19.085 --> 25:21.353
Oh, fuck.

25:21.420 --> 25:24.591
Okay. You guys can't hang out
in here anymore.

25:24.657 --> 25:27.827
- She's not coming back.
- Seriously, get out.

25:27.894 --> 25:30.930
- I'm not a fleck.
- Rules.

25:30.997 --> 25:32.965
How many times I gotta say this?
I don't argue.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.868
Okay? I paper, I plead,
and I settle.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.037
Seriously.
If I'm your strategy,

25:38.104 --> 25:40.139
then you gotta get
a new strategy.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.613
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

25:46.613 --> 25:49.616
- Oh, hi.
- Billy, this is Marva.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.217
- Hi.
- How you doing?

25:51.283 --> 25:52.652
Good. How are you?

25:52.719 --> 25:54.453
And this is Patty Salton
something.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.456
- No.
- Okay. Hi.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.191
Marva has agreed to take over.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.662
Take over what?

26:02.729 --> 26:05.665
She'll be my replacement.

26:05.732 --> 26:08.635
She has considerable experience
as a legal secretary.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.469
- And I--
- Come here a sec, Brittany.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.672
I wanna ask you something.
Come here.

26:12.739 --> 26:15.642
I gotta go back to my other job.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.244
Right?
We agreed on a temporary basis.

26:18.310 --> 26:21.513
- What's up?
- I gotta get on
with my life, Billy.

26:21.648 --> 26:23.515
You said for one case,
which I did.

26:23.650 --> 26:24.751
Yeah, and we're not done.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.218
We gotta go
to federal court now.

26:26.285 --> 26:29.121
I-- Billy, I need
to make a living.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.023
Well, you're gonna make
a living. I told you.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.524
This is a real
fucking case here.

26:32.659 --> 26:33.926
You're gonna get paid.
I promise.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.561
- I have clients of my own.
- I know that.

26:35.662 --> 26:36.963
But I thought
we had something here.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.397
Besides, look at
this fucking woman.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.032
Look how goddamn big she is.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.734
- This is a little
fuckin' place.
- Hey. Shh!

26:41.801 --> 26:43.803
No disrespect, but fuck.

26:43.870 --> 26:47.306
You gotta stay with me here,
honey. Please.

26:47.373 --> 26:49.676
It's really not fair
for you to beg like that,

26:49.742 --> 26:51.978
'cause you know I owe you.

26:53.145 --> 26:54.714
Come on.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.385
Fine.

27:02.554 --> 27:06.158
But Marva stays
and I train her.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.294
It's fine by me.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.441
Hey, Jason. Hi.

27:22.508 --> 27:27.313
My God, look at you,
you got so tall.
Give me a hug. Hi.

27:27.379 --> 27:30.382
Good to see you.
God, you look so much
like your dad.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.184
Rachel.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.920
Hey, um--

27:33.986 --> 27:37.389
Hi, Gina.
I hope it's okay.

27:37.456 --> 27:39.225
No, it's not.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.393
- Mom, please.
- Jason, go inside.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.730
Now. I'll be in in a minute.

27:44.731 --> 27:46.165
It's good to see you.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.369
This is rude.

27:50.436 --> 27:53.906
You're just stopping by
without calling first?

27:53.973 --> 27:56.142
I did call, Gina,
you don't return my calls.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.510
That didn't stop you
from coming, did it?

27:58.577 --> 28:01.647
I just thought that you both
deserve to understand what's
going on.

28:01.748 --> 28:06.018
We don't want to have anything
to do with you or your bullshit
case.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.887
Ryan didn't kill himself.

28:07.954 --> 28:11.023
He wouldn't kill himself.
He loved Jason too much.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.424
- He loved you too much.
- I know that.

28:12.491 --> 28:15.828
I actually have
his suicide note upstairs.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.496
Do you wanna read it again?

28:17.563 --> 28:21.367
Do you wanna read about how much
he hated what he was doing?

28:21.433 --> 28:23.836
How much he hated himself?

28:23.903 --> 28:26.438
Do your lawyers even know
about the note?

28:28.808 --> 28:30.176
Oh, Jesus.

28:37.383 --> 28:40.853
Do you have any idea
how much this hurts us?

28:40.920 --> 28:43.089
How much this hurts Jason?

28:45.391 --> 28:46.793
Just go.

29:04.811 --> 29:06.112
The room key.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.080
- He checked in yet?
- No.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.319
- Thank you, sweetie.
- Of course.

29:25.832 --> 29:29.468
♫ It's been a year
since I really rolled out

30:12.778 --> 30:14.580
Pretty.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.849
Pretty woman.

30:19.685 --> 30:20.920
Yeah.

30:26.658 --> 30:30.796
I'll just be--
God damn, they rigged these
fuckin' blood test results.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.164
- Billy.
- I wasn't drunk.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.066
Okay, look,
I will handle the DUI.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.902
Okay? That I can do.
What was your blood alcohol?

30:35.968 --> 30:38.704
You just handle the federal
case. Let me worry about
the DUI.

30:38.770 --> 30:41.941
Why are you being so dumb?
My entire practice is dealing
with DUIs.

30:42.008 --> 30:46.145
Excuse me, hon.
I don't see anywhere
here in your pleading

30:46.212 --> 30:48.047
where you say that there
was a wrongful act.

30:48.114 --> 30:50.482
A man blew up on a boat
owned by the defendant.

30:50.549 --> 30:51.884
Res ipsa.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.156
Something wrong happened.
It's obvious.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.591
That's all you got?
Something wrong happened?

30:59.658 --> 31:02.528
- I'll just handle
the federal case, too.
- Fuck you, Billy.

31:02.594 --> 31:05.331
"Fuck you" is good in traffic,
but not in court, okay?

31:05.397 --> 31:07.934
In the real world, lawyers
have to argue cases and shit.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.735
Thank you.
Thank you for your wisdom.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.104
Honey, I was doing this shit
back when you were wondering

31:12.171 --> 31:13.940
why Ken and Barbie
didn't have genitals.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.608
I used to handle
20 cases at a time.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.677
I think I can handle two.

31:18.744 --> 31:21.113
- Jesus Christ.
- Billy?

31:21.180 --> 31:22.949
Talk to you for a second?

31:37.863 --> 31:40.432
- Okay, let's have it.
- Okay.

31:42.401 --> 31:45.837
- Denise was pretty shaken up.
- Yeah, so was I.

31:45.972 --> 31:48.207
She was tased, Billy.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.142
Well, I wasn't drunk, okay?

31:50.209 --> 31:52.178
She could have been
seriously hurt--

31:52.244 --> 31:54.713
Yeah? Well, talk to your
goddamn boss about that.

31:54.780 --> 31:59.285
You are insane, if you think
that Donald Cooperman has

31:59.351 --> 32:02.321
some conspiracy against you,
insane!

32:02.388 --> 32:04.523
Okay. Well, let me explain
something to you.

32:04.590 --> 32:05.891
Ever since I took this case,

32:05.992 --> 32:07.793
weird shit's happening
to me, okay?

32:07.859 --> 32:09.996
People are following me,
I'm getting pulled over
by the cops,

32:10.029 --> 32:11.130
having my ass beat.

32:11.197 --> 32:14.033
- You're so crazy.
- Yeah?

32:14.100 --> 32:16.302
- Let it go.
- It's not happening.

32:16.368 --> 32:20.006
- No.
- You can't win this.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.640
Yeah, maybe not.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.242
But I'm sure as shit
gonna try.

32:23.309 --> 32:24.876
And let me tell you
something else.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.478
As much as I'd like
to fuck Cooperman,

32:26.545 --> 32:29.148
that's not the reason
I'm in this one.

32:29.215 --> 32:32.918
I'm actually doing this again.

32:33.019 --> 32:35.154
So get ready for it,
will you?

32:35.221 --> 32:37.056
I don't care why
you're in this one.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.891
Just leave our daughter
out of it, okay?

32:40.026 --> 32:41.460
Yeah, well, I kind of was.

32:41.527 --> 32:44.063
And then you let her,
you know, get lost.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.032
Sorry about the--

32:46.098 --> 32:47.399
Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

32:47.466 --> 32:51.170
I have some unsettling
and some good news.

32:51.237 --> 32:53.405
Yeah? Well, give it to me.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.307
The clerk from the federal court
just called to say

32:55.374 --> 32:56.708
that the case
has been dismissed.

32:56.775 --> 33:00.279
No explanation given.
Just dismissed.

33:00.346 --> 33:02.248
I know, it's unsettling.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.818
Well, what's the good news?

33:06.885 --> 33:09.188
Your friend Alma called.

33:10.589 --> 33:13.525
How the fuck did he get the case
reinstated in state court?

33:13.592 --> 33:15.461
It was dead in state court.
I saw it die.

33:15.527 --> 33:18.297
- And yet it lives.
- That's not an answer.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.166
It wasn't actually dismissed
with prejudice.

33:20.232 --> 33:21.967
It got kicked because
Billy didn't show up.

33:22.068 --> 33:23.469
We refiled the motion
to dismiss.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.071
We're back in there tomorrow.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.805
This time it will be
squashed for good.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.174
How do you know that?

33:28.240 --> 33:30.642
Because the Gnome has
the assignment.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.878
And Cooperman is the one
that got him the appointment.

33:32.944 --> 33:36.248
Wait. The Gnome?
I don't like the Gnome.
He's a loose cannon.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.717
We are gonna be fine,
Leonard.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.086
This should be settled.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.953
Donald Cooperman
will not use our money

33:42.088 --> 33:43.189
to fight his vendetta.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.456
That not what this is about.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.192
I don't care
what this is about.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.260
Donald Cooperman
can't let it go.

33:48.327 --> 33:50.196
He is obsessing
over Billy McBride.

33:50.262 --> 33:53.632
And I am telling you,
this thing could be
fucking us up the ass.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.134
- Oof!
- Hard!

33:55.201 --> 33:57.769
Leonard, sweetie.

33:57.836 --> 34:01.240
Maybe this whole general
counsel gig isn't for you.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.209
You don't seem
to be having fun.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.777
Do not handle me,
Callie.

34:09.648 --> 34:12.651
People should be happy
in life, that's all
I'm saying.

34:15.121 --> 34:19.458
- The Gnome.
- Yeah, regardless.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.627
And you say
he's Cooperman's friend?

34:21.693 --> 34:23.229
Not necessarily.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.431
Most of Cooperman's friends
hatehis guts.

34:25.497 --> 34:28.767
Keller's a decent judge.
He's just a nasty little prick.

34:28.834 --> 34:33.505
Okay, so should we survive
the motion to dismiss
tomorrow, we settle.

34:33.572 --> 34:36.242
- Right?
- Could be.

34:36.308 --> 34:38.477
Let's assume for the sake
of argument

34:38.544 --> 34:41.213
that you are everything
you're cracked up to be.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.749
Let's even say you show up
to court tomorrow.

34:43.815 --> 34:49.155
We are talking about one of the
top three law firms in the world

34:49.155 --> 34:52.258
and then there's Born's Tech
which is a fucking

34:52.324 --> 34:55.327
massive global weapons
manufacturer.

34:55.394 --> 34:58.164
Then there's us,
which is not so great.

34:58.164 --> 35:01.833
So there's windmills,
and there's windmills.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.602
So, what? You wanna give up?

35:03.669 --> 35:06.638
Yeah, they're a big deal.
So what?

35:06.705 --> 35:09.175
Look, part of being a lawyer
is knowing when you're on
to something.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.177
And we're on to something.
All right?

35:11.243 --> 35:14.846
Oh, God,
please don't fuck this up.

35:19.618 --> 35:23.322
This is not me going behind
Donald Cooperman's back.

35:23.389 --> 35:25.191
I wanna be clear about that.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.759
Well, I'm pleased
to hear that, Leonard.

35:27.826 --> 35:30.196
Because it sounded
like you were.

35:30.229 --> 35:33.365
I'm just saying
the case should have settled,
but Cooperman won't do it.

35:33.432 --> 35:38.069
Wait a minute,
I'm confused.

35:38.204 --> 35:40.439
I thought it was dismissed.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.374
It was dismissed
in state court

35:42.441 --> 35:44.210
when Billy McBride
failed to show.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.644
Then he filed in federal court

35:45.711 --> 35:48.514
where Donald, to his credit,
got it squashed,

35:48.580 --> 35:50.216
even without a hearing.

35:50.249 --> 35:52.618
But then the case resurfaced
in state court.

35:52.684 --> 35:55.354
You must have had a friend
in the clerk's office.

35:55.421 --> 35:59.758
This McBride is desperate,
which to me makes him dangerous.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.528
We should throw some money
at him and make this go away.

36:02.594 --> 36:05.697
But Cooperman is too blinded
by his anger to see that logic

36:05.764 --> 36:09.768
You know what I think?
I think it's a small price
to pay

36:09.835 --> 36:11.770
to make Donald happy.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.239
Cooperman works for us.

36:13.239 --> 36:16.942
He acts like it's
the other way around.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.345
Maybe it is.

36:22.381 --> 36:25.251
Look, do you know what
that guy Larson did here?

36:29.288 --> 36:31.323
What are you talking about?

36:31.390 --> 36:34.560
He worked on the Falcon class
line of fuel systems for the
Navy.

36:37.729 --> 36:40.266
That's not what he did,
Leonard.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.804
What do you mean?

36:45.871 --> 36:48.740
Do you actually want
to know what he worked on?

36:48.807 --> 36:50.509
Yes.

36:52.478 --> 36:54.813
No, you don't.

36:59.084 --> 37:02.888
If Donald Cooperman wants
to carry water on this
or anything else,

37:02.954 --> 37:04.823
you know what you job is?

37:04.890 --> 37:06.124
It's to say yes, sir.

37:06.191 --> 37:08.560
Thank you, sir.
Will that be all, sir?

37:47.466 --> 37:50.836
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.

37:50.902 --> 37:53.872
- You wrote a nice brief, Lucy.
- Thank you.

37:53.939 --> 37:57.809
Judge Rosten Keller is sitting.
You've heard of him?

37:57.876 --> 38:01.012
- The Gnome?
- He's a very active gnome.

38:01.079 --> 38:04.350
He asks a lot of questions.

38:04.383 --> 38:05.517
I'm gonna need you there,

38:05.584 --> 38:07.353
should he want specifics

38:07.386 --> 38:09.154
on any of these cases
you've cited.

38:09.220 --> 38:11.490
- Great.
- He's also known

38:11.557 --> 38:13.091
to question second
and third chairs.

38:13.158 --> 38:15.894
He considers any attorney
of record to be fair game.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.997
I'm sure you can guess
my concern.

38:19.064 --> 38:22.701
Well, I've upped my dosage
of Alprazolam.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.269
Come.

38:24.370 --> 38:25.971
Come in.

38:31.910 --> 38:32.878
Smile.

38:34.112 --> 38:35.547
I'm sorry?

38:35.614 --> 38:37.683
I asked you to smile.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.054
Okay, please show me
you can do better than that.

38:46.458 --> 38:47.959
There you go.

38:48.026 --> 38:52.498
I want you to feel that smile
between now and tomorrow,

38:52.564 --> 38:56.067
in the hopes that it might
beget self-confidence.

38:56.134 --> 38:58.537
Judge Keller preys on the weak.

38:58.604 --> 39:01.973
I don't want him looking
at you and smelling blood.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.142
I expect poise and strength.

39:04.209 --> 39:06.478
I won't let you down.

39:08.647 --> 39:11.417
And should Judge Keller
call on you to speak,

39:11.483 --> 39:13.952
I expect you not to stutter.

39:57.028 --> 40:00.699
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. What's up?

40:00.766 --> 40:03.702
Uh, I was just wondering,

40:03.769 --> 40:08.474
would you wanna go grab coffee
with me sometime?

40:08.540 --> 40:11.510
Oh, sweetie.

41:13.338 --> 41:15.807
McBride:
This smells like shit, dude!

41:15.874 --> 41:17.776
I saw your fucking
mouth breather.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.945
You could be a--

41:22.948 --> 41:25.083
McBride: Fucker!

41:29.621 --> 41:31.723
Oh, my God.

41:37.228 --> 41:40.265
Wendell Corey's on line one.

41:48.273 --> 41:51.777
- Wendell.
- Donald. I've been thinking.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.245
This case needs to go away.

41:54.312 --> 41:56.347
- It shall.
- When?

41:56.414 --> 41:58.850
- Tomorrow.
- No later.

41:58.917 --> 42:01.319
Our general counsel,
Leonard Letts?

42:01.386 --> 42:03.589
He's getting nervous.

42:03.622 --> 42:05.891
And he's getting nosey.

42:07.593 --> 42:09.227
Are we done?

42:09.294 --> 42:12.063
You know, I've ben thinking.
You should come in for a visit,

42:12.130 --> 42:14.065
see what we've got
going on.

42:14.132 --> 42:16.067
I'll set it up for
sometime next week.

42:17.603 --> 42:18.937
Sounds good.

42:20.405 --> 42:22.007
Donald?

42:22.073 --> 42:24.309
It needs to go away tomorrow.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.892
Callie Senate is here.

42:55.674 --> 42:57.008
Moo.

42:59.745 --> 43:02.648
Are we ready?

43:02.648 --> 43:04.215
We are ready.

43:10.689 --> 43:13.191
The dog has to stay down,
Callie.

43:25.003 --> 43:28.239
Of all your lieutenants,
why me on this case?

43:33.712 --> 43:35.681
You have talent.

43:41.286 --> 43:42.688
That's it?

43:44.489 --> 43:47.125
Isn't that enough?

43:59.705 --> 44:01.707
There's nothing else in play?

44:07.445 --> 44:09.414
What else can be in play?

44:21.727 --> 44:24.062
Make sure the dog
stays down, Callie.

44:28.399 --> 44:29.835
He's rabid.

45:11.576 --> 45:13.544
Hey.

45:13.611 --> 45:15.380
Handsome, wow.

45:21.286 --> 45:24.322
Just go in there,
relax.

45:26.591 --> 45:27.793
Be you.

46:07.866 --> 46:09.835
If he doesn't show up,
can you argue this?

46:09.868 --> 46:12.670
He'll be here.
The hooker just texted me,
so we're fine.

46:19.377 --> 46:23.081
Oh, shit, it's them.

46:23.148 --> 46:26.517
They got that cold "who gives
a fuck about humanity" look.

46:30.188 --> 46:33.291
Walking in a "V" like geese.

46:39.898 --> 46:41.699
Right?

46:41.766 --> 46:44.735
Okay, confidence is key.
You with me?

46:44.870 --> 46:46.071
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

46:46.137 --> 46:48.473
'Cause if you look like
a winner,

46:48.539 --> 46:50.708
then they're gonna think--

46:50.775 --> 46:52.610
No.

46:52.677 --> 46:54.946
No.

47:22.908 --> 47:24.976
All rise.

47:25.043 --> 47:28.079
The Honorable Rosten Keller
presiding.

47:28.146 --> 47:30.181
Oh, my fucking God.

47:32.217 --> 47:34.452
Good morning, Counsel.
Please.

47:36.654 --> 47:40.525
This case seems to be hanging
around like a bad smell,

47:40.591 --> 47:43.794
thanks to my clerk.

47:43.929 --> 47:46.297
Now then,
but I understand there continue

47:46.364 --> 47:48.599
to be problems with the
plaintiff's original filing.

47:48.666 --> 47:51.436
Yes, Your Honor.
The first issue
would be standing.

47:51.502 --> 47:53.371
Your Honor,
before we get to standing--

47:53.438 --> 47:58.977
Hi, I'm Patty Solis-Papagian
for the plaintiff.

47:59.044 --> 48:04.082
We're awaiting the arrival of
lead counsel William McBride.

48:04.149 --> 48:06.051
Judge:
And where is Mr. McBride?

48:09.254 --> 48:12.023
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
The traffic was a mess.

48:12.090 --> 48:14.425
I think the President's
in town or something.

48:14.492 --> 48:18.263
Miss Senate, Miss Kittridge,
and Mr. Letts were all here
on time.

48:18.329 --> 48:20.231
The litigant bringing
the case can't be bothered.

48:20.298 --> 48:22.233
Well, if protocol seems
to count--

48:22.300 --> 48:24.702
- Judge: It does!
-...I'm seven days early.

48:24.769 --> 48:27.672
Because, you know, the
defendant's required
to provide notice

48:27.738 --> 48:30.408
before scheduling
any motion to dismiss.

48:30.475 --> 48:33.444
Judge: Yes! Well,
we're all here now, so.

48:33.511 --> 48:35.546
Have a seat.
Let's proceed.

48:35.613 --> 48:38.249
The issue concerns standing.

48:38.316 --> 48:39.684
Miss Senate,
I'll hear from you.

48:39.750 --> 48:43.021
Thank you, Your Honor.
Rachel Kennedy is neither spouse

48:43.088 --> 48:44.755
nor surviving child
of the deceased.

48:44.822 --> 48:46.992
Wrongful death can be asserted
by anyone financially

48:46.992 --> 48:49.494
or emotionally dependent
on the decedent.

48:49.560 --> 48:52.597
No California court has ever
conferred standing--

48:52.663 --> 48:55.800
My client's brother blew up
on the defendant's boat.

48:55.866 --> 48:58.003
First of all,
Mr. Larson took his own life.

48:58.003 --> 48:59.737
The OSHA report makes
that clear.

48:59.804 --> 49:02.840
And OSHA depended on an
investigation by the defendant.

49:02.907 --> 49:06.111
The issue is standing, counsel.
You're straying off point.

49:06.177 --> 49:08.379
No, actually I'm not.
The point of this lawsuit

49:08.446 --> 49:10.481
is to find out how Ryan Larson
was killed.

49:10.548 --> 49:14.252
I'm granting defendant's motion.
This case is dismissed.

49:14.319 --> 49:15.586
Hang on a second. What?

49:15.653 --> 49:17.122
Your complaint is defective
on standing.

49:17.188 --> 49:18.789
Therefore,
the case is dismissed.

49:18.856 --> 49:21.326
- Thank you.
- Are you kidding?

49:22.727 --> 49:24.262
Do I look like a kidder, sir?

49:24.329 --> 49:26.797
No, but you sound bought.

49:26.864 --> 49:29.100
I hope they paid you well.

49:29.167 --> 49:30.435
Oh, Jesus.

49:31.702 --> 49:33.171
What did you say to me?

49:33.238 --> 49:35.640
I said you sound bought.

49:35.706 --> 49:37.908
I meant you're acting like
a guy who's been bribed

49:38.043 --> 49:40.445
or otherwise in the bag
for the other side.

49:48.086 --> 49:50.121
The case is dismissed.

49:50.188 --> 49:53.458
I'm also fining
Mr. McBride $5,000

49:53.524 --> 49:55.426
for direct contempt of court.

49:55.493 --> 49:58.863
- Excuse me?
- I do not excuse you.

49:58.929 --> 50:01.466
Suggesting
that I've been bought...

50:01.532 --> 50:03.501
that'scontempt.

50:03.568 --> 50:05.970
I'm ordering the plaintiff
to pay full defense costs

50:06.037 --> 50:10.841
for both this proceeding
and the preparation time
connected thereto.

50:10.908 --> 50:12.810
Call my next case.

50:12.877 --> 50:14.545
What the fuck is this?

50:17.282 --> 50:19.684
That vulgarity will cost you
another $5,000.

50:19.750 --> 50:22.687
I don't give a shit.
Make it ten or fifteen,
you douchebag.

50:22.753 --> 50:26.324
Judge: Counsel,
you are dangerously close

50:26.391 --> 50:28.226
to having your ticket punched.

50:28.293 --> 50:31.229
Do you care if you ever
practice law again?

50:31.296 --> 50:32.463
That's a fair question.

50:32.530 --> 50:34.399
And you know what,
Your Honor?

50:34.465 --> 50:36.067
We can take that up
at my hearing.

50:36.134 --> 50:37.302
Judge: Where are you going!

50:37.368 --> 50:38.803
McBride: I'm just approaching--

50:38.869 --> 50:42.873
Don't you dare approach
my bench without asking!

50:42.940 --> 50:45.343
Back to your seat, sir.

50:49.214 --> 50:50.381
Alrighty.

50:52.417 --> 50:54.685
Well, like I was saying,
we'll take that up
at my hearing,

50:54.752 --> 50:56.321
because I'm sure
Your Honor knows,

50:56.387 --> 50:57.855
as any good judge would,

50:57.922 --> 50:59.890
even the corrupt kind,

50:59.957 --> 51:04.362
that by holding me in contempt,
you entitle me to a hearing,

51:04.429 --> 51:06.997
a hearing at which I'm allowed
to introduce evidence

51:07.132 --> 51:09.434
including
but not limited to

51:09.500 --> 51:11.836
misdeeds by defense counsel,

51:11.902 --> 51:12.970
and here's the good one--

51:13.037 --> 51:14.639
judicial bias.

51:14.705 --> 51:18.276
That's right, Your Honor,
I said judicial bias.

51:18.343 --> 51:20.745
Just put it on my fuckin' tab.

51:27.051 --> 51:29.019
Judge, schedule my hearing.

51:29.154 --> 51:31.289
What's good for you?

51:34.792 --> 51:38.929
My clerk will propose
a few dates--

51:38.996 --> 51:40.931
No!

51:40.998 --> 51:43.568
...and notify the parties.

51:51.576 --> 51:53.444
I don't understand
what just happened.

51:53.511 --> 51:55.646
Did we just win,
or did we lose?

51:55.713 --> 51:57.215
Both, kind of.

51:57.282 --> 52:00.718
Case got kicked,
but we're still open.

52:00.785 --> 52:02.420
That doesn't make any sense.

52:02.487 --> 52:03.921
No, it's the law.
It's not supposed to.

52:03.988 --> 52:07.091
Bottom line is,
is we're still in the game.

52:07.192 --> 52:08.459
That's the good news.

52:22.907 --> 52:25.210
Get back!

52:25.243 --> 52:27.312
Clear back! Come on!

52:28.213 --> 52:29.747
Woman: Somebody call 911!

52:29.814 --> 52:31.716
Man: I will!

52:31.782 --> 52:32.817
Rachel?

52:35.220 --> 52:36.587
Rachel.

54:22.192 --> 54:23.794
You stinker!
