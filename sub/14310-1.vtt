Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.169 --> 00:12.140
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.050
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:15.070 --> 00:16.178
They were good.

Then there was Gargamel,

He was bad.

I'll get you.

(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there.

00:47.090 --> 00:51.109
And if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.130 --> 00:55.179
And if you are good,
you may just catch a glimpse

00:55.200 --> 00:57.070

11:22.190 --> 11:25.179
This isn't funny!
How much further, Papa Smurf?

11:25.200 --> 11:27.159
(Papa Smurf)
'Not far now.'

11:31.009 --> 11:33.139
[panting]
Is it much further, Papa Smurf?

11:33.159 --> 11:36.149
(Papa Smurf)
Yes, it is!

11:36.169 --> 11:39.080
But there's nothing,
but a volcano, Papa Smurf.

11:39.100 --> 11:42.190
And you always said
volcanoes smurf fire and smoke

11:42.210 --> 11:45.019
and all kinds
of terrible and nasty things.

11:45.039 --> 11:48.120
True, true.
But this volcano is extinct.

11:48.139 --> 11:52.029
Oh, of course! Extinctive.

11:52.049 --> 11:54.110
Come on. Let's get this smurf
on the road.

11:54.129 --> 11:56.090
We have work to do.

11:57.230 --> 11:59.190
[instrumental music]

11:59.210 --> 12:01.000
[Smurfette sighs]

12:01.019 --> 12:03.070
[all grunting]

12:04.139 --> 12:07.220
Work, work, work. I hate work.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.230
Those miserable, rotten,
disgusting Smurfs

12:11.009 --> 12:12.139
crossed here, Azrael.

12:12.159 --> 12:15.200
Look at their
revolting little footprints.

12:15.220 --> 12:18.129
Come on.
They're within our grasp now.

12:18.149 --> 12:20.200
[laughs]

12:20.220 --> 12:22.039
Ah!

12:22.059 --> 12:24.080
Come on, Azrael!

12:24.210 --> 12:26.070
Meow!

12:26.090 --> 12:28.100
[instrumental music]

12:29.009 --> 12:29.210
Meow!

12:29.230 --> 12:32.070
Oh, you miserable cat, Azrael!

12:32.090 --> 12:35.139
How dare you? Oh!

12:35.159 --> 12:37.230
One of these days, Azrael

12:38.009 --> 12:40.169
I'm-I'm going to turn you

12:40.190 --> 12:42.190
'into a cat fur pillow!'

12:42.210 --> 12:44.190
Oh, no..

12:46.149 --> 12:49.169
[instrumental music]

12:52.129 --> 12:54.120
Why do we have
to smurf our brains out

12:54.139 --> 12:57.190
while Sleeping Astrosmurf here
sleeps?

12:57.210 --> 12:59.080
'This is for the Smurfs.'

12:59.100 --> 13:02.049
[Dreamy snoring]

13:02.070 --> 13:03.230
(Jokey)
Wait a second, Grouchy.

13:04.009 --> 13:06.059
Do you know what's green,
red and yellow

13:06.080 --> 13:08.210
with big eyes and long teeth?

13:08.230 --> 13:11.070
- No. What?
- I don't know either.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.000
(Jokey)
But it's crawlin' up your hat!

13:13.019 --> 13:15.059
(Grouchy)
Bah! I hate bugs.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.190
[Jokey laughing]

13:19.230 --> 13:22.070
(Gargamel)
Show me, oh, magic crystal ball

13:22.090 --> 13:25.210
where are the most disgusting
creatures of all.

13:25.230 --> 13:28.200
So, they're inside
the old volcano.

13:28.220 --> 13:32.090
That's not far from here
and it's the perfect spot

13:32.110 --> 13:33.139
to finally put an end

13:33.159 --> 13:35.179
to those
miserable little creatures.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.210
[laughing]

13:40.179 --> 13:42.059
When Astrosmurf wakens

13:42.080 --> 13:43.210
he'll think
he's on another planet.

13:43.230 --> 13:45.029
And we want to be ready

13:45.049 --> 13:48.149
so that's why I smurfed
this magical potion

13:48.169 --> 13:51.090
that will turn us all
into swoofs.

13:51.110 --> 13:55.080
Swoofs?
Uh, what's a swoof, Papa Smurf?

13:55.100 --> 13:57.159
I'll show you, Clumsy.

13:57.179 --> 13:58.190
pop

14:06.159 --> 14:10.009
This is a swoof!
I'm Grandpa Swoof.

14:11.179 --> 14:13.100
[yawns]

14:13.120 --> 14:15.080
Where am I?

14:18.149 --> 14:22.139
Oh! I'm on another planet!

14:22.159 --> 14:25.169
[instrumental music]

14:27.000 --> 14:29.080
This is smurftastic!

14:30.110 --> 14:31.200
Here he comes, Clumsy.

14:31.220 --> 14:34.009
Oh! Oh, yeah! Look at him.

14:34.029 --> 14:36.190
(Clumsy)
'He really thinks
he's on another planet.'

14:36.210 --> 14:40.029
[laughs]
Yup. Boy, is he dumb?

14:40.049 --> 14:43.149
I wonder where he was
when the beans were handed out.

14:43.169 --> 14:46.110
Not beans, Clumsy, brains.

14:46.129 --> 14:48.169
Oh, yeah. That's what I meant.

14:48.190 --> 14:51.000
Bean brain. Yup, yup.

14:51.019 --> 14:53.070
Wonder if anyone lives here.

14:53.090 --> 14:54.120
whoosh whoosh

14:54.139 --> 14:56.139
Guess that answers that!

14:56.159 --> 14:59.000
- Hiya!
- Ooh!

14:59.019 --> 15:02.179
Me, friend. Come in big ship.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.210
Vroom-voom.

15:04.230 --> 15:06.019
Vroom-vroom?

15:06.039 --> 15:07.110
Coming Grandpa Swoof.

15:07.129 --> 15:08.190
King of all swoofs.

15:08.210 --> 15:11.149
Say, uh, could you unhook
my shorts first?

15:11.169 --> 15:14.070
That would be nice. Yup.

15:14.090 --> 15:16.120
[instrumental music]

15:16.139 --> 15:18.009
(Papa Smurf)
Where you come from?

15:18.029 --> 15:22.039
From a-a-a planet called Earth,
Grandpa S-S-Swoof.

15:22.059 --> 15:24.149
- You friend or foe?
- Oh, me?

15:24.169 --> 15:26.179
Big friend. Big friend.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.220
Then we have council meeting
and consider this.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.179
- Stay here.
- Oh.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.139
I wonder
what they're gonna do to me.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.120
[hiccups]
Excuse me.

15:38.139 --> 15:39.190
[snoring]

15:39.210 --> 15:42.120
(Gargamel)
'We're almost there, Azrael.'

15:42.139 --> 15:44.049
'We're almost there.'

15:44.070 --> 15:46.000
[intense music]

15:47.139 --> 15:49.129
Gargamel. We better tell Papa.

15:49.149 --> 15:52.009
Yeah, and is he gonna be mad!

15:53.080 --> 15:56.019
Smurf, we have reached
a decision.

15:56.039 --> 15:59.159
- Oh?
- We decide you are friend.

15:59.179 --> 16:02.049
Welcome to Planet Swoof.

16:02.070 --> 16:05.110
[sighs]
Thanks, Grandpa Swoof.

16:05.129 --> 16:08.190
Prepare feast
to honor Astrosmurf!

16:08.210 --> 16:11.029
(all)
'Yay!'

16:12.029 --> 16:15.039
[tribal music]

16:20.059 --> 16:23.129
Boy, this sure is smurfy,
Grandpa Swoof.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.210
I'm havin' a great time!

16:25.230 --> 16:27.070
You sleep soon.

16:27.090 --> 16:29.049
Need plenty strength
to fly back

16:29.070 --> 16:31.000
to home planet tomorrow.

16:31.019 --> 16:34.059
Oh, but I'm never gonna
fly back to Earth.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.120
[chuckles]
I wanna stay here forever!

16:37.139 --> 16:40.009
Forever? But you must go.

16:40.029 --> 16:42.059
(Greedy and Lazy)
'Grandpa Swoof! Grandpa Swoof!'

16:42.080 --> 16:43.080
[screeching]

16:43.100 --> 16:45.230
[indistinct whispering]

16:46.009 --> 16:47.059
Where?

16:48.059 --> 16:50.129
Guard, take Astrosmurf to hut

16:50.149 --> 16:52.200
and don't let him out of sight!

16:54.129 --> 16:55.179
Gargamel is here.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.190
Astrosmurf mustn't see him

16:57.210 --> 16:59.190
or he'll know
he's still on Earth.

16:59.210 --> 17:02.009
But that's only
half our worries.

17:02.029 --> 17:04.029
Astrosmurf
likes the planet so much

17:04.049 --> 17:06.019
he wants to stay here forever.

17:06.039 --> 17:08.069
I must think of a plan.

17:10.089 --> 17:12.118
I know they're nearby, Azrael.

17:12.140 --> 17:16.019
I can smell them.
I can feel them.

17:16.039 --> 17:18.059
[Azrael snarling]

17:18.220 --> 17:20.160
Let me see.

17:20.180 --> 17:22.019
What's this?

17:22.039 --> 17:23.200
Those aren't smurfs!

17:23.220 --> 17:25.039
[growls]

17:26.079 --> 17:28.190
How Gargamel found us,
I don't know

17:28.210 --> 17:32.190
but I think he's about to feel
a bit under the weather.

17:35.130 --> 17:38.150
[thunder rumbling]

17:39.089 --> 17:40.130
Yeow!

17:40.150 --> 17:43.000
(Gargamel)
'My crystal ball!'

17:43.019 --> 17:44.150
[shattering]

17:44.170 --> 17:48.069
It's destroyed!
Now I'll never find the smurfs!

17:48.089 --> 17:49.190
Meow!

17:49.210 --> 17:52.099
[thunder rumbling]

17:53.049 --> 17:55.190
[rain pattering]

17:55.210 --> 17:57.230
Slimy lizard tongues.

17:58.009 --> 18:01.009
My seat is burnt to a crisp,
I'm soaking wet

18:01.029 --> 18:03.069
and my crystal ball
is shattered.

18:03.089 --> 18:04.210
What else can go wrong?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.170
[gibberish]

18:06.190 --> 18:08.089
[thunder rumbling]

18:09.230 --> 18:12.220
Something tells me Papa Smurf
is behind this, Azrael.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.089
[gibberish]

18:14.109 --> 18:16.140
[screaming]

18:16.160 --> 18:19.079
Azrael, get off my face!

18:19.099 --> 18:21.210
You-you mangy bag of fur!

18:21.230 --> 18:23.000
[thunder rumbling]

18:23.019 --> 18:25.009
Let's get out of here!

18:26.049 --> 18:29.039
- Ye-ouch!
- Meow!

18:29.059 --> 18:30.119
[instrumental music]

18:30.140 --> 18:32.009
Now, to become swoof

18:32.029 --> 18:34.099
you must prove
courage and skill.

18:34.119 --> 18:37.130
Okay.
But what do I have to smurf?

18:37.150 --> 18:41.029
After we spin you around,
you must swoof spear

18:41.049 --> 18:42.230
right into that bull's eye.

18:43.009 --> 18:45.160
(Dreamy)
'What bull's eye?
I can't see a thing.'

18:45.180 --> 18:48.000
It is the way of the swoof.

18:50.049 --> 18:51.150
whoosh

18:52.190 --> 18:54.019
whoosh

18:56.200 --> 18:59.009
[all gasping]

18:59.029 --> 19:01.130
I did it! I did it!

19:01.150 --> 19:04.210
Get greased-pole test ready!

19:04.230 --> 19:08.230
And for second test, Astrosmurf,
you must climb pole.

19:09.009 --> 19:11.180
(Dreamy)
I've smurfed taller in my time.

19:13.089 --> 19:16.049
[laughing]
It'll take him one zillion years

19:16.069 --> 19:19.099
to smurf that greased pole.
Ha-ha!

19:19.119 --> 19:23.029
Uh, yeah! That's right!
A zillion years.

19:23.049 --> 19:25.130
I hate greased poles.

19:25.150 --> 19:27.019
(Dreamy)
'Here I am!'

19:27.039 --> 19:28.109
[gasping]

19:28.130 --> 19:30.200
Piece of smurf.

19:30.220 --> 19:33.190
Hello, this pole
isn't even greased.

19:33.210 --> 19:36.099
Isn't greased? Clumsy?

19:36.119 --> 19:40.109
Oh! Oh, uh, I-I thought
Greedy was gonna do that.

19:40.130 --> 19:42.019
Uh, yup, I did.

19:43.130 --> 19:47.019
Me? I thought
Grouchy smurfed the pole.

19:47.039 --> 19:49.099
Lazy was gonna do it!

19:49.119 --> 19:52.009
[snoring]

19:53.009 --> 19:55.220
You must now swim across lake.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.079
Okay. I'm a good swimmer.

19:58.099 --> 20:01.230
- Carrying that rock.
- That rock?

20:02.009 --> 20:05.029
But that's
abso-smurfly impossible!

20:05.049 --> 20:07.029
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo!

20:07.049 --> 20:09.079
[sobbing]
Too bad.

20:09.099 --> 20:12.130
"Boo-hoo?"
Say, you look familiar.

20:12.150 --> 20:14.220
Haven't I seen you
someplace before?

20:15.000 --> 20:18.180
Who, me, you say?
No, I was just--

20:18.200 --> 20:20.029
Time wasting.

20:20.049 --> 20:21.059
You want to be swoof

20:21.079 --> 20:23.230
you swim across lake with rock.

20:24.009 --> 20:28.109
Huh? Oh, this is gonna be easy.

20:28.130 --> 20:29.150
[laughing]

20:29.170 --> 20:32.069
Hey, is this
some kind of a joke?

20:32.089 --> 20:35.180
- 'Oh, that rock!'
- 'It's floating!'

20:35.200 --> 20:38.190
- 'Huh?'
- No wonder.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.150
splash

20:40.170 --> 20:43.109
It's pumice stone.

20:43.130 --> 20:44.200
There is one final test.

20:44.220 --> 20:46.200
- Astrosmurf.
- I'm ready.

20:46.220 --> 20:49.170
You must prove you can live
harsh life of swoofs

20:49.190 --> 20:52.160
and you must cook all meals,
wash dishes

20:52.180 --> 20:54.069
sweep, clean and scrub.

20:54.089 --> 20:57.170
And you must kneel in respect
before every swoof you meet.

20:57.190 --> 20:59.210
- And kiss his beautiful feet.
- But--

20:59.230 --> 21:01.140
And all you can eat
is wild grass.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.079
(Brainy)
'And you can never whistle
or sing.'

21:03.099 --> 21:05.059
(Smurfette)
'No matter how happy you are.'

21:05.079 --> 21:07.170
(Clumsy)
'And no holidays
including Swoofmas'

21:07.190 --> 21:09.140
'and Saint Swoofentine's Day.'

21:09.160 --> 21:14.059
So you must do all these things
to be swoof!

21:15.140 --> 21:17.140
Well, on second thought

21:17.160 --> 21:21.079
uh, maybe I better be
smurfing back to Earth.

21:21.099 --> 21:23.200
[sighing]

21:23.220 --> 21:26.230
[clanking]

21:31.200 --> 21:32.210
[yawns]

21:33.000 --> 21:34.130
What's going on?

21:34.150 --> 21:36.160
I feel so sleepy.

21:36.180 --> 21:40.089
[yawns]
Oh, I mustn't. Oh..

21:40.109 --> 21:43.109
[snoring]

21:46.190 --> 21:50.220
He's asleep. The raspberry
potion is working again.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.109
We better smurf to it.

21:52.130 --> 21:53.150
pop

21:58.150 --> 22:02.039
Oh, goody!
There's nothing like a smurf.

22:02.059 --> 22:04.019
Nothing in the world!

22:05.019 --> 22:06.130
- I hate this!
- Oh.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.140
How much further, Papa Smurf?

22:08.160 --> 22:11.140
(Papa Smurf)
'Oh, smurf up!'

22:11.160 --> 22:12.160
[snoring]

22:12.180 --> 22:14.059
[yawns]

22:14.079 --> 22:16.009
[snoring]

22:16.029 --> 22:19.180
Where, where am I?

22:19.200 --> 22:21.180
(Brainy)
'Long live Astrosmurf!'

22:21.200 --> 22:24.079
Three cheers for Astrosmurf!

22:24.099 --> 22:27.180
(all)
Hurray, hurray, hurray!

22:27.200 --> 22:30.170
I'm home! I'm home!

22:31.150 --> 22:33.140
It was smurftastic, Papa Smurf.

22:33.160 --> 22:36.099
I have been to a planet
inhabited by swoofs.

22:36.119 --> 22:39.059
Swoofs? Well, I never..

22:39.079 --> 22:42.069
They wanted me to stay,
but I was feelin' homesick

22:42.089 --> 22:43.140
so I came back.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.119
You're not thinking
of going away again..

22:45.140 --> 22:47.119
- Are you?
- Well..

22:47.140 --> 22:50.150
The thought of flying
to other planets is tempting

22:50.170 --> 22:54.000
but I'll never be as happy
as I am here.

22:54.019 --> 22:57.000
'There's no place like home!'

22:57.019 --> 22:59.029
[all sighing]

23:00.049 --> 23:03.099
- Yeow!
- Meow!

23:03.119 --> 23:07.069
This is Papa Smurf's handiwork.
But he'll pay for it.

23:07.089 --> 23:09.210
He'll pay double!

23:09.230 --> 23:11.220
Yeow!

23:14.049 --> 23:16.170
[theme music]

23:39.200 --> 23:42.220
[instrumental music]

23:44.039 --> 23:47.109
