Now, someone has clearly
discovered this feature,

15:58.167 --> 16:00.457
and they're having
a little fun at our expense.

16:00.628 --> 16:01.628
Okay?

16:04.173 --> 16:08.053
Whoever's doing this, the object
is to get all of you upset.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.798
So let's not play
into that, okay?

16:09.970 --> 16:11.850
Let's just remain calm,
chill out,

16:12.014 --> 16:13.408
and take a few minutes
to figure out

16:13.432 --> 16:14.732
exactly what's happening,
okay?

16:14.892 --> 16:16.522
So, thank you.
I'm gonna go work on that.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.895
And I'll circle back
to you as soon as I can.

16:19.063 --> 16:20.363
Thanks, everybody.

16:21.899 --> 16:24.989
So, someone's just
taking the piss. Right?

16:32.743 --> 16:33.743
(COUGHS)

16:33.869 --> 16:34.869
(SNIFFS)

16:35.704 --> 16:36.714
Hey, what's up?

16:36.872 --> 16:37.922
Are you smoking pot?

16:38.082 --> 16:39.082
What?

16:39.249 --> 16:41.749
We just had our lives threatened
and you come up to hang out?

16:41.919 --> 16:43.339
That dude on the speakers?
Please.

16:43.837 --> 16:44.917
That shit's hilarious.

16:45.089 --> 16:47.219
You guys are insane
for smoking pot at Belko.

16:47.383 --> 16:49.093
They test here.
They'll fire you, you know.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.679
It's from Panama, man.
It's not that strong.

16:51.887 --> 16:53.177
(LAUGHS)

16:53.764 --> 16:55.274
It isn't.
I know.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.458
It ain't melting
at all, Bud.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.038
No, no, look.
It ain't even hot.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.339
What?
Feel it. Feel it.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.640
I've never seen
anything like that.

17:32.553 --> 17:34.223
Do you know what
kind of metal this is?

17:34.847 --> 17:35.847
BUD: Mmm.

17:36.974 --> 17:38.734
I don't really know.

17:44.648 --> 17:45.648
MIKE: Barry.

17:46.442 --> 17:48.492
Sorry, this is rude.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.532
Damn hot with
all these bodies.

17:50.738 --> 17:54.318
Yeah. Um, I think that they
turned the air conditioning off.

17:54.491 --> 17:55.661
Hey, Wendell.
Yo!

17:55.826 --> 17:57.156
Can I get one of those?
100%.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.251
Hey, listen.

18:01.832 --> 18:04.632
It's great that you
calmed everybody down,

18:05.711 --> 18:07.301
but, um, I don't
think this is a prank.

18:07.463 --> 18:09.013
No?

18:09.173 --> 18:11.183
No, I mean,
these walls,

18:11.341 --> 18:14.851
they seem designed to keep
people in just as much as out.

18:15.012 --> 18:17.722
There's no cell reception.
That's not an easy thing to accomplish.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.230
(SOFTLY) Those new
guards this morning?

18:20.392 --> 18:21.852
I saw one of them
heading over

18:21.935 --> 18:23.435
to that old hangar
that's next door.

18:23.604 --> 18:26.404
So my guess is that is
where they're set up.

18:29.818 --> 18:30.988
So what are you saying?

18:31.737 --> 18:33.377
We should pick out
a couple folks to kill?

18:33.530 --> 18:34.950
No, no.
Not at all.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.325
That was a joke, Mike.

18:37.493 --> 18:38.833
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

18:38.994 --> 18:40.294
I mean, I know.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.964
Um, but I'm not sure how much
people are gonna be joking

18:44.124 --> 18:45.384
if something else
happens.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.962
Something like what?

18:49.588 --> 18:51.548
Something.
Listen, Mike.

18:51.715 --> 18:52.795
In a situation like this,

18:52.883 --> 18:55.223
it's normal for a handful of
folks to panic and overreact.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.175
Would you agree with that?
Sure.

18:57.346 --> 19:00.516
So why don't you consider that you
might be one of those people?

19:00.682 --> 19:01.682
All right?

19:03.268 --> 19:05.148
I brought some bottled water
from the cafeteria.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.830
Why don't you guys
grab yourselves some?

19:13.904 --> 19:16.664
Not getting jack up here, either.
God damn it.

19:16.824 --> 19:17.954
Keith!

19:18.158 --> 19:20.288
I see one!
Who?

19:20.494 --> 19:21.624
Right there! Look!

19:21.787 --> 19:24.117
In the window.
The security guard from this morning.

KEITH: Hello!
LEOTA: Help us!

19:28.293 --> 19:29.803
We're stuck!
We're trapped!

19:29.962 --> 19:32.012

19:37.678 --> 19:38.928
What the fuck?

19:39.096 --> 19:42.266
You guys,
quit getting so worked up.

19:43.684 --> 19:44.984
I'm sorry.
What, man?

19:45.143 --> 19:47.603
Bro, did you even happen
to read what you signed

19:47.771 --> 19:49.441
when you started
working for this place?

19:49.940 --> 19:52.320
We gave these fuckers
the right to do

19:52.484 --> 19:54.420
practically whatever the fuck
they wanted to do to us.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.494
Oh, kill us?

19:55.654 --> 19:56.864
No, dude.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.780
It's a psychological
fucking test, man.

19:59.950 --> 20:02.330
They wanna see how we'll
react to this bullshit.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.624
Look at me.
Look how fucking chill I am.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.708
They lose, man.
I fucking win.

20:06.874 --> 20:07.964
So just relax

20:08.125 --> 20:09.665
and take the day off, man.

20:09.835 --> 20:12.165

here, they put tracers.

22:07.411 --> 22:08.930

in the back of our heads.

22:10.455 --> 22:12.375
What if they're rigged to explode?
LEANDRA: What?

22:14.751 --> 22:17.071
That's why the locals were sent home.
They don't have them.
