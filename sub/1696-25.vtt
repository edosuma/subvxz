03:03.500 --> 03:04.378
big turn-off!

Raspberries!That's it
That's what's been making me sick

03:24.180 --> 03:25.775

That was the last time that governor ever presented that award..

03:57.510 --> 03:58.904
Or wore that suit

04:00.055 --> 04:02.996
Now even a whiff of raspberry makes my sick

04:03.000 --> 04:06.358
Hey why don't you just use the fake one?
It is only filled with water

04:07.000 --> 04:08.763

It doesn't matter! I am done with that commercial and I never have to smell the perfume again!

04:39.669 --> 04:40.847
You're wearing it aren't you?

04:42.322 --> 04:45.119
No...Yes,I like it

04:45.200 --> 04:47.168
It doesn't matter you can't keep it

04:47.200 --> 04:48.493

05:02.000 --> 05:03.751
Everybody clear!

05:11.000 --> 05:13.546
Miley,it's been a half hour

05:13.550 --> 05:17.170
If that tomato juice is gonna get rid of the smell it would work by now

05:20.100 --> 05:22.041
You're right, this is getting ridiculous

05:23.169 --> 05:27.618
Getting?You pass "ridiculous" when you took that bath in tuna fish

05:27.800 --> 05:30.534
Hey,It says it will work in the stink website

05:30.981 --> 05:34.196
I should've back out of the commercial the minute I smell that perfume!

05:35.241 --> 05:39.896
Now I smell worse than Uncle Earl after he was drilling for oil and hit that sewage pipe.

05:39.985 --> 05:43.680
Okay, if I haven't said this before, I don't ever want to meet Uncle Earl.

05:44.900 --> 05:48.324
Uncle Earl is not that bad. The one you don't want to meet is Aunt Max.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.597
Talk about your bearded lady.

05:50.940 --> 05:54.058
Anyhow, honey,I found this whole bag of kitty litter that was out on the garage,

05:54.100 --> 05:57.285
It suppose to activate when you scratch it,might be worth a shot!

05:58.400 --> 06:01.308
Dad, this isn't funny. You didn't see what I went through!

06:02.000 --> 06:03.651
I'm sorry honey, I was a little busy.

06:03.741 --> 06:05.437
Yeah, hiding from Liposuction Liza!

06:05.800 --> 06:10.183
I wasn't hiding! I just got stuck trying to get out the bathroom window.

06:11.031 --> 06:12.874
I'm sorry but that lady is just plain weird!

06:13.367 --> 06:15.556
Hi-yahhh!!

06:17.900 --> 06:19.371
She's not the only one...

06:20.650 --> 06:22.916
Dad, I am about to make you proud

06:23.000 --> 06:24.742

08:57.034 --> 09:00.208
I don't know why I pay for cable when I get a son like him

09:02.000 --> 09:03.061
So what is on your mind,bud?

09:03.161 --> 09:07.939
Daddy,is there any way that you can call the oh wow people and have them stop that commercial from going on the air?

09:08.185 --> 09:09.464
This thing really is eating at you isn't it?

09:09.500 --> 09:11.495
Yeah, the perfume makes me sick£¡

09:11.814 --> 09:13.642

10:19.192 --> 10:19.887
Say what?

10:21.101 --> 10:23.985
Hey Mile, they are not gonna let us keep it when you back out of their commercial

10:24.100 --> 10:29.363
The only thing I am backing out of is this drive way in my sweet new ride

10:30.643 --> 10:34.474
Now hold your horses
I thought you say you couldn't stand the smell of that perfume

10:34.999 --> 10:38.696
Right now all I am smelling is new car and...

10:40.616 --> 10:41.590
muffins!

10:41.596 --> 10:45.510
Yeedoggie!I hope they are little chocolate chip ones.

10:53.700 --> 10:56.262
Man.this car handles like a dream

10:56.845 --> 10:58.198
She really hugs the road

10:59.446 --> 11:02.999
Just think,one day you will have your permit,you can really drives this thing

11:03.386 --> 11:04.183
I know

11:05.300 --> 11:07.462
Selling out is the best thing you ever did!

11:08.114 --> 11:09.707
i didn't sell out

11:09.708 --> 11:14.281
Oh please,You did a commercial saying you love something that makes you want to yak!

11:16.111 --> 11:18.511
Okay, maybe a little

11:18.609 --> 11:20.952
But,everybody exaggerates in commercials

11:21.094 --> 11:26.625
I mean, do you really thinks that football player's mom follows him around with a can of soup?Doubt it!

11:28.035 --> 11:30.652
Hey,Mile
The Oh Wow people just called

11:30.882 --> 11:32.526
Do you still sure about going through this?

11:34.420 --> 11:36.745
That's car talks for"Oh yeah baby"!

11:37.634 --> 11:43.737
Okay then,congratulations
Tomorrow night you gonna be telling people how much you love the sweet smell of Oh Wow

11:43.981 --> 11:46.183
On the real deal with Collin Lassiter

11:46.200 --> 11:49.827
Collin Lassiter?
That's the biggest interview show on TV

11:49.973 --> 11:51.132
Yup,I know,bud

11:51.560 --> 11:53.640
Hey there is still time to pull off the plug if you want to

11:53.894 --> 11:55.271
And give back our car?

11:57.107 --> 12:03.713
I mean..You do what you feel is right,I am just gonna sit here enjoying what time I have left with..Maria

12:05.200 --> 12:08.406
Lily, don't worry
Our car is not going anywhere

12:09.206 --> 12:10.534
You tell Collin I will be there

12:10.875 --> 12:12.946
Okay then,I will go make the call

12:13.618 --> 12:18.246
I am so proud of you
I can never go in front of whole world and lie,....

12:20.027 --> 12:24.299
When I tell my dad I finish my homework when I haven't,I start giggling like an idiot

12:24.900 --> 12:27.067
Well,that is the difference between me and you

12:27.320 --> 12:30.231
I can go on Collin's show and say that I love Oh Wow

12:33.900 --> 12:34.791
What was that?

12:34.800 --> 12:35.555
Nothing

12:36.000 --> 12:38.930
I just thought of something funny,
Its not like I was laughing because I was lying

12:41.500 --> 12:42.937
You did this to me£¡

12:50.900 --> 12:55.280
After a six hours hunt
I finally bag this beauty

12:56.106 --> 13:01.875
My first solid food..in six hours..and two minutes

13:04.000 --> 13:09.716
And now,I will start my own fire
And cook my feast

13:14.300 --> 13:18.132
Though u gives me a fierce battle,oh mighty crab

13:19.800 --> 13:23.981
In the end, your primitive little brain was no match for mine

13:25.700 --> 13:27.895
Aw,man..where did it go

13:28.493 --> 13:31.653
Dang flabet...Oliver..

13:32.100 --> 13:33.910
Don't worry,its erased

13:34.811 --> 13:39.880
But I think you should know at this point we only have twenty-seven seconds of usable footage!

13:40.222 --> 13:42.749
Who cares about footage,I am starving!

13:42.823 --> 13:43.822
Tell me about it

13:44.000 --> 13:46.477
Remember, we are going through this together

13:46.808 --> 13:50.806
You and me,side by side
Living on nothing but...

13:50.841 --> 13:53.349
Pizza delivery for Oliver Oken

13:53.421 --> 13:54.290
Right here, dude

13:55.496 --> 13:57.373
Oliver you are brilliant

13:57.646 --> 13:59.317
Hey, give me a slice

13:59.840 --> 14:01.169
I can't do that,man

16:28.420 --> 16:30.649
- All I have to do is not lie

16:30.678 --> 16:34.134
If I don't lie,then I won't giggle

16:34.423 --> 16:36.911
For example,Ask me what I think of the perfume

16:37.095 --> 16:38.129
What do you think of the perfume?

16:38.542 --> 16:41.315
Its like nothing I have ever smelled before

16:41.909 --> 16:44.151
You see, no giggles

16:45.773 --> 16:50.360
Hey darling,The more I think about it,the more I think going on that show is a bad idea

16:50.427 --> 16:51.925
Daddy you worry too much

16:52.000 --> 16:55.196
What if he brings out a bottle of that  perfume,you get a whiff of it?

16:55.200 --> 16:59.204
Thought about it. I've already got about a pound of vaporub in my nose.

16:59.299 --> 17:04.066
Right now I can smell one of Jackson's dirty socks and live to tell the tale

17:05.378 --> 17:09.848
I'll have to remember that next time I go visit Uncle Earl and he's cooked up a pot of that three-bean chili

17:10.775 --> 17:11.528
You sure you are okay?

17:11.775 --> 17:14.213
Trust me dad,everything is gotta be fine

17:17.800 --> 17:18.732
What is so funny?

17:19.030 --> 17:21.573
What is not funny dad?
You gotta learn to laugh more

17:21.717 --> 17:23.452

17:37.000 --> 17:38.953
You had to plant that giggling thing on my head?

17:39.369 --> 17:42.938
Look on the bright side,
You can always cover giggling by saying something was funny

17:43.233 --> 17:46.661

17:50.655 --> 17:54.411
