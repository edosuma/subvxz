WEBVTT

00:01.225 --> 00:02.695
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.725 --> 00:05.020
If this prophecy is fulfilled,

00:05.050 --> 00:06.348
you will all fall.

00:06.378 --> 00:07.543
One by friend,

00:07.545 --> 00:08.404
one by foe,

00:08.434 --> 00:10.418
and one by family.

00:10.448 --> 00:12.286
This transformed me

00:12.316 --> 00:13.583
into something new.

00:13.585 --> 00:16.207
My bite is lethal.

00:16.236 --> 00:17.275
Why are you doing this?

00:17.305 --> 00:19.596
Nik stole the love of my life!

00:20.046 --> 00:22.642
I do love you, you know.

00:22.962 --> 00:24.777
I will carry you with me.

00:25.218 --> 00:27.536
I guess that makes me immortal.

00:28.733 --> 00:29.888
When Cami dies,

00:29.918 --> 00:31.084
he will lash out at me.

00:31.086 --> 00:33.002
But I will end him.

00:33.872 --> 00:35.905
The Ancestors are doing this to you.

00:38.270 --> 00:39.542
Kol?

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.711 --> 01:14.460
What are you doing here?

01:36.134 --> 01:38.217
The Ancestors had a hold of me.

01:38.219 --> 01:40.479
I-I was out of my head.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.723
I never would've hurt her.

01:43.375 --> 01:45.375
I tried to make it stop.

01:45.577 --> 01:47.299
I made her dagger me.

01:47.329 --> 01:48.878
Nothing worked!

02:10.348 --> 02:12.710
I loved her.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.551
I swear I did.

02:27.970 --> 02:29.275
Get up.

02:31.505 --> 02:33.305
Get up.

02:34.592 --> 02:36.114
This is New Orleans.

02:36.144 --> 02:38.277
Witch spirits can be
brought back from the dead,

02:38.279 --> 02:41.230
so that is exactly
what we are going to do.

02:42.567 --> 02:45.618
We are going to bring her back!

02:45.620 --> 02:50.602
== sync & corrections by Wolfhound ==
== www.addic7ed.com ==

02:59.733 --> 03:02.156
Did you bring it?

03:02.186 --> 03:04.120
Jack wrote down everything
your father told him

03:04.150 --> 03:05.788
about the ancient werewolves.

03:06.340 --> 03:07.628
I've read it.

03:07.658 --> 03:09.692
I don't think there's
anything in there that's

03:09.694 --> 03:10.999
gonna help us kill Lucien, though.

03:11.029 --> 03:13.000
I'll see for myself.

03:13.030 --> 03:14.619
You can go.

03:15.367 --> 03:17.972
Klaus, I think that

03:18.002 --> 03:19.567
we should do something about the body,

03:19.597 --> 03:21.887
about Cami.

03:22.139 --> 03:24.645
I know that she wanted an Irish wake.

03:24.675 --> 03:26.297
I can... I can make the arrangements.

03:26.327 --> 03:28.944
It doesn't matter what she wanted!

03:28.946 --> 03:30.451
She's gone.

03:30.481 --> 03:32.682
There's no time to sing dirges.

03:32.684 --> 03:34.400
We're at war.

03:35.472 --> 03:36.936
Yeah.

03:36.938 --> 03:38.521
Okay.

03:49.016 --> 03:51.433
Good news, Freya, I think
I found a spell that'll

03:51.435 --> 03:53.769
draw together all the
serum that Aurora took.

03:53.771 --> 03:55.554
Now, it's gonna take a little while,

03:55.556 --> 03:57.139
but if I can concentrate
it in her heart,

03:57.141 --> 03:58.891
we can extract it with this...

03:58.893 --> 04:01.110
destroy it, and make sure
we ain't got no more of these

04:01.112 --> 04:03.229
- unkillable monsters on our hands.
- Good.

04:03.231 --> 04:04.864
In the meantime,

04:04.866 --> 04:05.981
I think I may have finally

04:05.983 --> 04:07.066
found a way to kill Lucien.

04:07.068 --> 04:09.201
Now, my mother once tried

04:09.203 --> 04:10.653
to end my siblings by

04:10.655 --> 04:12.488
reversing the Original vampire spell,

04:12.490 --> 04:13.989
and according to her grimoire,

04:13.991 --> 04:15.541
only the witch who cast
the spell could undo it.

04:15.543 --> 04:17.827
You created that serum;
therefore, according

04:17.829 --> 04:20.161
to my mother, you can turn Lucien back

04:20.164 --> 04:21.664
and then Klaus can rip his head off.

04:21.666 --> 04:23.465
Freya, it wasn't my power
that cast that spell.

04:23.467 --> 04:27.336
The Ancestors used me as a
conduit for some ugly magic

04:27.338 --> 04:29.922
that only the spirits have access to.

04:30.925 --> 04:32.141
I'm sorry,

04:32.143 --> 04:34.510
but nobody alive can tap into that.

04:38.349 --> 04:40.482
Marcel has been blowing up my phone.

04:40.484 --> 04:42.184
All right, I'll be back.

04:47.450 --> 04:48.558
Something the matter?

04:48.588 --> 04:50.026
I need a strand of your hair.

04:50.028 --> 04:52.061
I'm working on an early warning system.

04:52.063 --> 04:54.280
Lucien has all the witch
Ancestors in New Orleans

04:54.282 --> 04:55.565
on his side.

04:55.567 --> 04:56.732
I need to know if they

04:56.734 --> 04:57.733
tried to magically interfere

04:57.735 --> 04:59.637
with any one of you.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.571
Freya, when we said no
rest for the the wicked,

05:01.573 --> 05:02.788
I certainly didn't expect you to...

05:02.790 --> 05:04.290
I'm up against centuries

05:04.292 --> 05:05.875
of dead witches who are apparently now

05:05.877 --> 05:07.543
strong enough to reach
beyond the grave and shake

05:07.545 --> 05:08.911
the entire city on its foundation.

05:08.913 --> 05:11.163
I'll rest once I've sent them all

05:11.165 --> 05:12.798
running back to hell.

05:15.753 --> 05:18.087
Okay, we got to get her
consecrated right now.

05:18.089 --> 05:19.755
If we don't we can't even
attempt to get her back.

05:19.757 --> 05:21.173
We can't consecrate her!

05:21.175 --> 05:22.592
What the hell are you talking about?

05:22.594 --> 05:24.644
The Ancestors despise Davina.

05:24.646 --> 05:26.312
If we consecrate her, she'll wake up

05:26.314 --> 05:28.314
in their domain, and
they will destroy her.

05:28.316 --> 05:29.565
If we don't,

05:29.567 --> 05:30.516
we never see her again.

05:30.518 --> 05:31.887
Hey, that's enough.

05:31.917 --> 05:32.735
All right?

05:32.737 --> 05:33.840
We all want to help her,

05:33.870 --> 05:35.521
so we need to make sure
that she's consecrated,

05:35.523 --> 05:36.739
but she's got to be safe

05:36.741 --> 05:38.107
so we're gonna pull her into a place

05:38.109 --> 05:39.108
where she's protected,

05:39.110 --> 05:40.192
then we can resurrect her.

05:41.946 --> 05:44.113
And that's gonna
require a lot of energy,

05:44.115 --> 05:46.866
and my power's not what it
used to be before I got shunned.

05:48.837 --> 05:49.952
All right, we need Freya.

05:49.954 --> 05:51.621
You think my family's going to help?

05:51.623 --> 05:53.172
Nik hates Davina.

05:53.639 --> 05:54.940
Freya will not defy him.

05:54.942 --> 05:56.108
This wouldn't be happening

05:56.110 --> 05:57.660
if it wasn't for your family.

05:58.964 --> 06:00.279
Prepare her body.

06:00.281 --> 06:02.281
Come with me.

06:03.389 --> 06:04.950
What do you think, Van?

06:04.952 --> 06:07.620
Surely, you can see that
vampirism has its perks.

06:07.622 --> 06:09.255
No lines at the DMV,

06:09.257 --> 06:11.957
no hangovers, got the abs
of the laborer I once was,

06:11.959 --> 06:14.261
and the cuticles of a real housewife,

06:14.291 --> 06:15.878
and I can quite literally

06:15.880 --> 06:18.430
hear your eyes roll
from across the room.

06:18.432 --> 06:20.850
- Am I boring you?
- No...

06:20.852 --> 06:22.802
just wondering why you had
your friends bring me here

06:22.804 --> 06:24.470
if you were just gonna
pick out man jewelry.

06:24.472 --> 06:27.306
I requested your company
for a progress update,

06:27.909 --> 06:29.308
'cause I am still waiting

06:29.310 --> 06:31.977
for you to get me access
to the Mikaelson home.

06:31.979 --> 06:33.813
It's not magic keeping you out.

06:33.815 --> 06:34.980
They signed over the deed to the place;

06:34.982 --> 06:36.315
they put it in the sister's name.

06:36.317 --> 06:38.367
You can't get in unless she invites you.

06:41.205 --> 06:44.039
Hmm, perhaps I'll lure
him out another way.

06:44.041 --> 06:45.241
If killing his girlfriend

06:45.243 --> 06:47.042
didn't get him out of the house,

06:47.044 --> 06:48.160
I don't know what will.

06:48.350 --> 06:49.350
I do.

06:50.746 --> 06:53.582
I'm going to kill his other sister.

06:54.911 --> 06:56.285
Hmm.

06:57.705 --> 06:59.288
This is a war.

06:59.290 --> 07:01.991
Please, understand, I
despise the situation.

07:01.993 --> 07:03.766
- No, that's the wrong answer!
- No, no, no,

07:03.796 --> 07:05.711
I know this is a war

07:05.713 --> 07:07.563
but I've lost a lot of friends, too.

07:08.152 --> 07:09.381
Today...

07:09.383 --> 07:11.333
I need your help.

07:12.630 --> 07:14.370
Then you shall have it.

07:17.987 --> 07:19.280
Come on, Kol.

07:19.310 --> 07:21.727
Let's get you cleaned up.

07:28.686 --> 07:30.235
Thank you.

07:34.082 --> 07:36.408
My daddy used to tell
us that the Ancestors

07:36.410 --> 07:38.027
linger on to give us a safe place

07:38.029 --> 07:41.864
to land after a hard
life comes to an end...

07:43.032 --> 07:46.368
but if they're responsible
for taking you...

07:46.370 --> 07:48.420
and Cami...

07:50.469 --> 07:52.207
I don't know.

07:54.261 --> 07:56.845
Maybe death does something to us.

07:58.349 --> 08:01.300
Twists us all up into something ugly.

08:12.279 --> 08:14.646
That ain't gonna happen to you.

08:17.551 --> 08:20.418
We're bringing you home.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.984
I'll draw Davina's spirit to a circle.

08:23.014 --> 08:23.848
As long as she's there,

08:23.878 --> 08:25.997
the Ancestors won't
be able to torment her.

08:26.027 --> 08:26.819
With luck that will buy you

08:26.849 --> 08:29.646
some time to find a way
to resurrect her, but...

08:29.931 --> 08:31.347
I'll need to channel an Original

08:31.349 --> 08:32.847
if I'm going to sustain the spell.

08:32.850 --> 08:34.265
Well, take me. Put me
down for all I care,

08:34.268 --> 08:35.851
- if it keeps her safe.
- No, you've...

08:35.852 --> 08:38.020
been marred by the Ancestors' magic, so,

08:38.022 --> 08:41.273
Klaus, Elijah, rock, paper, scissors.

08:46.046 --> 08:48.580
That can't be good.

08:50.501 --> 08:52.551
My early warning system.

08:52.581 --> 08:53.769
I think a New Orleans witch

08:53.771 --> 08:54.992
is trying to meddle with one of you.

08:55.022 --> 08:56.188
Lucien has the new Regent

08:56.190 --> 08:57.678
at his beck and call.

08:57.708 --> 08:59.791
It's me he's coming after.

09:04.882 --> 09:06.632
No.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.103
He's going after Rebekah.

09:23.722 --> 09:24.460
Lucien thought

09:24.490 --> 09:25.728
that killing Cami would have me charging

09:25.758 --> 09:27.395
into his lair on a suicide mission.

09:27.397 --> 09:29.264
When it didn't, he set
his sights on Rebekah.

09:29.266 --> 09:30.648
He's kicking hornets' nests,

09:30.650 --> 09:32.934
until we have no choice
but to confront him.

09:32.936 --> 09:34.018
Presumably, he still believes

09:34.020 --> 09:35.437
she's at the bottom of the ocean.

09:35.439 --> 09:36.855
I cloaked all of you,
but with the Ancestors

09:36.857 --> 09:38.656
working for Lucien, it may take awhile,

09:38.658 --> 09:40.558
but if he wants to
find Rebekah, he will.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.392
I'll go get her.

09:41.394 --> 09:42.360
It's not safe out there.

09:42.362 --> 09:43.528
What then?!

09:43.530 --> 09:44.996
Are we to sit here and play cards

09:44.998 --> 09:48.046
until Lucien slides Rebekah's
bitten corpse down the hall?

09:48.076 --> 09:49.367
Let me go.

09:49.369 --> 09:50.668
I moved her.

09:51.838 --> 09:53.204
What, don't look so surprised.

09:53.206 --> 09:54.289
I never did like you
two sharing secrets.

09:54.291 --> 09:55.457
Tell me where she is,

09:55.459 --> 09:56.958
unless you expect me to stay here

09:56.960 --> 09:58.626
and leave our sister
entirely defenseless.

09:58.628 --> 10:00.428
I expect you to prevent Kol

10:00.430 --> 10:02.630
from suffering the same loss that I did.

10:05.302 --> 10:07.886
Lucien deserves our collective ire.

10:07.888 --> 10:10.138
Today, your grievances are tabled.

10:23.412 --> 10:24.235
Seriously?

10:24.237 --> 10:25.992
Look, Klaus, we both know
how this is going to go down.

10:26.022 --> 10:27.689
You're going to tell
me that I can't come,

10:27.691 --> 10:29.574
and then I'm going to tell
you that I love Rebekah, too.

10:29.576 --> 10:31.409
Then you're going to say,
I'm going to slow you down,

10:31.411 --> 10:33.077
and I'm going to remind
you that you're the one

10:33.079 --> 10:34.696
who cursed me to be a
werewolf for six months,

10:34.698 --> 10:37.467
and therefore, I know
every inch of the bayou.

10:37.497 --> 10:38.916
Now, unless you want to be delayed

10:38.918 --> 10:41.669
by an angry werewolf
grandma with a shotgun,

10:41.671 --> 10:43.955
you should just admit that you need me.

10:46.426 --> 10:47.759
I'll drive.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.369
Freya.

10:59.706 --> 11:01.155
I need this to work.

11:01.157 --> 11:02.707
Don't worry, brother.

11:02.709 --> 11:05.210
Eleventh hour spells
happen to be my specialty.

11:06.913 --> 11:09.297
Tell Vincent to begin the consecration.

11:29.936 --> 11:31.603
Okay, kid.

11:31.605 --> 11:33.438
See you soon.

11:50.774 --> 11:53.291
No. Kol.

12:09.559 --> 12:12.060
We've been waiting for you, Davina.

12:27.718 --> 12:30.066
We have such...

12:30.096 --> 12:32.313
plans for you.

12:43.026 --> 12:45.582
There will be nothing

12:45.612 --> 12:47.111
left of you.

13:12.272 --> 13:14.806
Whatever it is you did, thank you.

13:40.216 --> 13:42.216
Klaus, I know that you're angry.

13:42.218 --> 13:43.801
I don't need advice on healthy mourning

13:43.803 --> 13:45.970
from the girl who kept
her husband's rotting heart

13:45.972 --> 13:47.138
in a box, thank you.

13:47.140 --> 13:48.723
Look, I get it.

13:48.725 --> 13:50.358
You think that if you revert
to being the cruel bastard

13:50.360 --> 13:51.609
that you were before you met Cami,

13:51.611 --> 13:52.860
you can pretend like
she was never there.

13:52.862 --> 13:54.111
Like she never changed you.

13:54.113 --> 13:55.646
You want to commiserate with me, Hayley,

13:55.648 --> 13:57.148
but our experiences of
grief are not the same.

13:57.150 --> 13:58.566
Your husband is dead.

13:58.568 --> 14:00.735
It hurts, but we both
know the person you share

14:00.737 --> 14:02.987
a true connection with
is still breathing.

14:02.989 --> 14:05.540
So you and I are not the same.

14:07.127 --> 14:08.376
What happened?

14:08.378 --> 14:09.761
What did you see?

14:09.763 --> 14:12.347
Van's mother. Kara Nguyen.

14:12.349 --> 14:13.464
The witch I had assassinated.

14:13.466 --> 14:14.682
She was there.

14:14.684 --> 14:16.851
She tried to magically mark me.

14:17.252 --> 14:18.720
As she did it, I felt

14:18.722 --> 14:20.367
freezing cold

14:21.107 --> 14:23.057
and then this impossible sadness.

14:24.394 --> 14:26.728
Did she have a dark green stone?

14:28.148 --> 14:30.398
La Gemme Vital.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.400
The Lifeblood Stone.

14:32.402 --> 14:33.618
They tried to use it on me,

14:33.620 --> 14:35.441
but my vampire soul was too stained

14:35.471 --> 14:36.804
for their magic to work.

14:36.806 --> 14:39.473
Davina, if she had
succeeded at marking you,

14:39.475 --> 14:41.364
your very soul would
have shredded into pieces.

14:41.394 --> 14:43.227
A fate worse than death.

14:43.229 --> 14:44.779
There'd be no rescuing you.

14:44.781 --> 14:46.364
All right, that stone

14:46.706 --> 14:49.150
is your Ancestors' greatest punishment.

14:50.870 --> 14:53.121
Well, it's a good thing she didn't then.

14:53.123 --> 14:54.322
I'm right here,

14:54.324 --> 14:55.990
and you're going to bring me back.

14:55.992 --> 14:58.910
Today... right?

14:59.996 --> 15:01.996
I swear it.

15:10.223 --> 15:12.173
It's Vincent.

15:12.175 --> 15:13.508
He's ready.

15:14.170 --> 15:16.978
We'll have the magic
to resurrect you soon.

15:25.689 --> 15:28.606
I think there's a way to kill Lucien.

15:28.608 --> 15:30.608
What is it?

15:30.610 --> 15:33.157
As long as Davina's
caught between our worlds,

15:33.187 --> 15:35.029
I can use her as a
conduit to channel power

15:35.031 --> 15:36.748
from the Ancestors.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.916
The same power that was
used to create Lucien.

15:38.918 --> 15:40.084
Once I have it,

15:40.086 --> 15:42.537
I can make Lucien killable again.

15:44.249 --> 15:45.801
So what's the problem?

15:47.366 --> 15:48.960
Everything comes with a price.

15:50.380 --> 15:53.381
In order to take power
from the Ancestors,

15:53.383 --> 15:55.049
you have to steal it.

15:55.051 --> 15:58.019
Which means, to make Lucien killable,

15:58.049 --> 15:59.771
I'll have to draw through Davina,

15:59.773 --> 16:01.606
while she's in the Ancestral Well.

16:01.608 --> 16:02.857
And to do that, I will have to

16:02.859 --> 16:04.776
break the circle that protects her.

16:06.396 --> 16:08.730
We can't do that.

16:08.732 --> 16:10.198
- Freya, that will destroy her.
- I know

16:10.200 --> 16:12.650
what's at stake, Elijah.

16:13.886 --> 16:15.337
I know.

16:19.626 --> 16:21.209
What the hell do we do?

16:30.830 --> 16:32.496
And Freya is certain this power

16:32.498 --> 16:33.907
will be enough to kill Lucien?

16:34.733 --> 16:35.516
Yes.

16:35.546 --> 16:37.768
But we'd be placing
Davina in terrible danger.

16:38.970 --> 16:40.573
The only thing protecting
her from the Ancestors

16:40.603 --> 16:41.477
is Freya's circle.

16:41.507 --> 16:42.498
Now, if it is broken...

16:42.640 --> 16:44.591
They'll rip her apart,
Elijah. She's just a kid.

16:44.593 --> 16:46.009
What choice do we have?

16:46.011 --> 16:47.060
No.

16:47.196 --> 16:48.083
Find another way.

16:49.281 --> 16:50.196
If we destroy Davina,

16:50.198 --> 16:51.898
we lose both Kol and Marcel.

16:51.900 --> 16:53.950
I won't have us all
turning on each other.

16:53.952 --> 16:55.552
Keep looking, brother.

17:07.445 --> 17:09.415
Have you found Rebekah's body yet?

17:09.417 --> 17:10.417
No.

17:11.169 --> 17:13.169
She's not buried in any ocean.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.739
My magic tells me she's close by.

17:19.428 --> 17:21.645
Buried somewhere in the bayou.

17:24.797 --> 17:26.900
You did a nice thing
today, Klaus, for Davina,

17:26.902 --> 17:28.318
who you hate.

17:28.319 --> 17:29.912
It was a purely strategic decision,

17:29.942 --> 17:30.904
- I assure you.
- Maybe.

17:30.906 --> 17:32.739
Or maybe you knew that
Cami cared about her,

17:32.741 --> 17:35.441
and would have wanted
you to fight for her.

17:36.078 --> 17:38.161
You know, I thought I
told Camille everything.

17:38.163 --> 17:40.530
Every moment that mattered from my past,

17:40.532 --> 17:42.365
and yet, in the mere
hours since she died,

17:42.367 --> 17:44.617
I've thought of a thousand
things I forgot to say.

17:44.619 --> 17:46.670
Yeah. I know the feeling.

17:47.031 --> 17:48.031
Do you?

17:49.041 --> 17:51.341
Because the prophecy is still upon us.

17:51.343 --> 17:54.928
And my brother's immortality
suddenly seems quite fragile.

17:54.930 --> 17:56.262
Talk to him,

17:56.264 --> 17:57.797
Hayley.

17:57.799 --> 17:59.516
Stop wasting your time.

18:14.816 --> 18:16.950
It's a nice piece you got.

18:16.952 --> 18:18.985
What are you, a murderer for hire now?

18:20.275 --> 18:21.955
I know. I know. I know. I know. I
know. I know. I know. I know. I know.

18:21.957 --> 18:24.240
I'm not supposed to be in the cemetery.

18:24.606 --> 18:25.492
It's hard for me to stay away

18:25.494 --> 18:27.944
after what the Ancestors did to Davina.

18:30.374 --> 18:32.499
Why are they targeting her, Van?

18:32.912 --> 18:34.339
She betrayed our community.

18:34.369 --> 18:36.252
No. This community betrayed itself.

18:36.254 --> 18:37.754
I mean, look at you.

18:38.673 --> 18:40.223
You're a Regent of New Orleans,

18:40.225 --> 18:42.425
and you're doing spells
for Lucien Castle?

18:42.986 --> 18:44.260
A vampire who's

18:44.262 --> 18:46.412
dead set on destroying this city.

18:47.182 --> 18:49.132
I bet your mama's real proud.

18:51.153 --> 18:52.402
The Ancestors have a vision

18:52.404 --> 18:54.237
for a Mikaelson-free New Orleans.

18:54.239 --> 18:55.739
Lucien is a means to their ends,

18:55.741 --> 18:57.824
and they won't let
anyone stand in their way.

18:57.826 --> 18:59.025
They killed Davina

18:59.027 --> 19:00.944
for working with vampires.

19:00.946 --> 19:02.746
- I bet you're next in line.
- Van,

19:02.748 --> 19:05.647
you have no clue what sort
of trouble you're in, man.

19:05.677 --> 19:06.636
Tell me this,

19:06.666 --> 19:07.617
did the Ancestors lay out

19:07.619 --> 19:08.918
their plan for you,
or are you in the dark,

19:08.920 --> 19:10.120
like everybody else?

19:10.122 --> 19:11.287
What do you know?

19:11.289 --> 19:13.339
You've been shunned, Vincent.

19:13.341 --> 19:15.291
Your magic doesn't
compare to mine anymore.

19:15.293 --> 19:16.926
Careful now,

19:16.928 --> 19:19.378
'cause my magic is still plenty strong.

19:22.634 --> 19:25.969
Especially when coupled
with head trauma.

19:34.229 --> 19:37.363
I pushed him away for so
long, Klaus, what if...

19:39.941 --> 19:41.034
What if he doesn't...

19:41.036 --> 19:43.036
He does.

19:50.162 --> 19:51.795
Ask him yourself.

20:03.558 --> 20:05.725
They're not answering.

20:05.727 --> 20:08.478
And the Strix tell me that
Lucien is headed to the bayou.

20:11.824 --> 20:13.624
He knows where Rebekah is.

20:16.354 --> 20:18.822
We're out of time.

20:19.691 --> 20:21.691
We need to put an end to this.

20:21.693 --> 20:23.193
The only way to get the power

20:23.195 --> 20:26.830
I need to kill Lucien is to use Davina.

20:32.170 --> 20:35.205
This wasn't your fault, or Kol's.

20:35.207 --> 20:38.374
The Ancestors hate me because
of choices that I made.

20:38.376 --> 20:40.126
I'm not a kid.

20:40.439 --> 20:42.545
I'm not your responsibility.

20:44.299 --> 20:47.717
Honey, you will always
be my responsibility.

20:48.743 --> 20:50.803
What were you supposed to do?

20:50.805 --> 20:52.860
Lock me in an attic and keep the world

20:52.890 --> 20:54.140
at bay forever?

20:56.859 --> 20:59.206
You didn't let me down.

21:00.115 --> 21:01.648
I just grew up.

21:03.568 --> 21:07.070
Thank you for saving me that first time.

21:07.858 --> 21:09.739
And for everything else after.

21:12.695 --> 21:14.744
I love you, Marcel.

21:16.649 --> 21:17.781
I love...

21:18.250 --> 21:19.249
Forgive me, Marcel.

21:26.391 --> 21:27.974
No, please. You'll break the circle!

21:28.572 --> 21:30.343
Please, please stop this!

21:30.345 --> 21:31.561
Don't do this to me!

21:31.563 --> 21:35.098
Don't make me go back, please! Marcel!

21:40.772 --> 21:42.939
No, please, don't let go! Marcel!

21:44.609 --> 21:47.277
No! Don't let go!

21:47.279 --> 21:48.429
Don't let go!

21:51.283 --> 21:53.616
Please don't let go!

22:16.191 --> 22:18.107
It had to be done.

22:43.010 --> 22:44.414
Who broke the circle?

22:44.416 --> 22:45.782
Elijah jumped me.

22:45.784 --> 22:47.751
- Freya took Davina down somehow.
- My brother?

22:47.753 --> 22:49.369
- Why would he do that?
- Forget about that.

22:49.371 --> 22:51.288
We need to resurrect Davina now.

22:51.290 --> 22:52.622
Van's going to use every
bit of his Regency power

22:52.624 --> 22:53.840
to bring her back.

22:53.842 --> 22:55.008
Good.

22:55.010 --> 22:56.660
I'll get Davina's body.

23:24.489 --> 23:27.040
Nik. I was hoping to run into you.

23:28.493 --> 23:30.493
Oh, come now, it's no fun if it's easy.

23:30.495 --> 23:32.495
At least Cami went down swinging.

23:55.312 --> 23:57.070
Haven't you learned yet, Nik?

23:57.072 --> 23:58.188
I am finally

23:58.190 --> 24:00.323
your superior in every way.

24:23.048 --> 24:24.244
I can smell it.

24:24.274 --> 24:26.299
The stench of fear.

24:26.301 --> 24:28.218
Uncomfortable, isn't it?

24:28.220 --> 24:31.805
Knowing your life could
be snuffed out any second.

24:34.476 --> 24:37.110
No, please, no please, no.

24:39.448 --> 24:40.864
Please!

24:44.069 --> 24:45.785
Count your heart beats, Klaus.

24:53.412 --> 24:57.247
Please! Please! No! Please.

25:12.230 --> 25:14.347
Okay, it's time to begin.

25:33.001 --> 25:34.417
Wake up, Davina.

25:36.745 --> 25:38.014
Come on...

25:40.959 --> 25:42.592
Wake up, come on. Wake up!

25:59.694 --> 26:01.144
What happened?

26:04.107 --> 26:05.107
Nothing.

26:07.369 --> 26:08.902
It's like she wasn't there at all.

26:10.322 --> 26:11.458
The Ancestors got to her first.

26:11.488 --> 26:13.456
Where the bloody hell is she?!

26:17.662 --> 26:19.129
That's it, man.

26:21.166 --> 26:23.333
She's gone.

26:26.171 --> 26:29.305
No, no, no, no.

27:26.314 --> 27:29.983
It's a shame Aurora isn't
here to witness your victory.

27:31.103 --> 27:33.153
You think this is inspired by lost love?

27:33.685 --> 27:35.572
No. This is about station.

27:35.574 --> 27:36.940
A simple stable-boy

27:36.942 --> 27:38.358
better than a tyrannical king.

27:39.111 --> 27:41.444
You have to admit,
it's a hell of a story.

27:41.852 --> 27:44.080
I am not the villain of this fairy tale

27:44.082 --> 27:45.532
you've conjured.

27:46.164 --> 27:49.085
Lucien, we were friends.

28:18.216 --> 28:20.395
- Do it again!
- I can't.

28:20.425 --> 28:22.301
If I had a chance at it, it's gone now.

28:22.303 --> 28:23.893
Then you just became disposable.

28:23.923 --> 28:25.438
Whoa, Kol, let him go.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.939
It's over.

28:28.575 --> 28:30.443
Davina would have wanted it that way.

28:39.877 --> 28:40.707
No.

28:40.737 --> 28:44.123
I should have known better
than to trust your family.

28:44.909 --> 28:46.347
You people destroy

28:46.377 --> 28:48.711
everything you touch.

29:09.784 --> 29:11.367
Oh, wow.

29:12.653 --> 29:14.236
A queen and a king,

29:14.238 --> 29:16.895
caught by a one time pawn.

29:16.925 --> 29:19.809
Thus the game comes
to its inevitable end.

29:20.799 --> 29:22.338
What are proving by killing her?

29:22.368 --> 29:23.646
It's me you hate.

29:23.648 --> 29:27.900
Was I not clear when I
murdered Finn and Camille?

29:27.902 --> 29:29.936
I don't care who dies.

29:29.938 --> 29:31.982
But since you do,

29:32.434 --> 29:33.656
indulge me.

29:34.859 --> 29:36.526
And I just might spare

29:36.528 --> 29:38.027
the mother of your child.

29:40.208 --> 29:41.798
Kneel.

29:42.283 --> 29:45.701
Get on your knees.

29:48.316 --> 29:50.957
I can feel her heart
pounding in my fist.

29:51.911 --> 29:53.831
Do you really want to measure your pride

29:53.861 --> 29:55.995
against my mercy?

30:30.815 --> 30:32.281
His power's gone.

30:32.598 --> 30:35.367
He's nothing but an
ordinary vampire now.

30:35.369 --> 30:37.075
You see that family drama

30:37.105 --> 30:38.721
you so joyfully deride,

30:38.723 --> 30:39.972
does have its merits.

30:42.679 --> 30:43.593
You can kill me,

30:43.595 --> 30:44.844
but the prophecy still stands.

30:44.846 --> 30:46.395
You cannot outrun it.

30:46.397 --> 30:49.156
I've had about a thousand
years too much from you.

30:49.186 --> 30:50.316
For a century,

30:50.318 --> 30:51.684
you lived with my name,

30:51.686 --> 30:53.185
and you never did quite recover

30:53.187 --> 30:54.437
from losing it, did you?

30:54.439 --> 30:56.439
You became a man of wealth and stature,

30:56.441 --> 30:58.991
but you never could
crawl from my shadow.

30:58.993 --> 31:00.693
And in the end...

31:03.878 --> 31:06.699
despite the gift of immortality,

31:06.701 --> 31:09.425
you have always known

31:09.673 --> 31:11.370
what you truly are.

31:13.879 --> 31:15.016
Please...

31:23.184 --> 31:25.518
You... are...

31:25.520 --> 31:26.936
nothing.

32:20.615 --> 32:24.085
Camille liked the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band.

32:25.519 --> 32:28.222
For the funeral, the second night,

32:28.985 --> 32:31.759
we should hold the wake at Rousseau's.

32:37.501 --> 32:38.917
Come on.

32:38.919 --> 32:40.953
Let's let Lucien burn alone, eh?

32:41.850 --> 32:43.538
We should get back to Kol and Marcel.

32:43.540 --> 32:44.706
Klaus.

32:46.677 --> 32:48.927
There's something you need to know.

33:23.501 --> 33:26.632
I did everything you asked.

33:26.634 --> 33:28.801
I joined your stupid cult,

33:28.803 --> 33:30.769
I left my friends in the dust

33:30.771 --> 33:32.683
because that's what you needed!

33:32.713 --> 33:33.897
Marcel...

33:33.927 --> 33:36.058
I fought for Hope!

33:36.060 --> 33:37.976
I kept Hayley breathing!

33:37.978 --> 33:39.895
I kept white oak

33:39.897 --> 33:44.066
from piercing your cold, black heart.

33:45.486 --> 33:48.320
I did everything!

33:48.322 --> 33:49.738
We know.

33:51.308 --> 33:53.142
No, you don't.

33:53.144 --> 33:55.132
No, you don't.

33:55.162 --> 33:56.912
Marcel, he had no choice.

34:04.155 --> 34:06.655
Oh, they were right about you.

34:06.657 --> 34:07.956
Yeah.

34:08.871 --> 34:12.161
Aurora, Tristan, Lucien.

34:12.610 --> 34:14.996
Anybody who's not your family

34:14.998 --> 34:16.748
is nothing to you.

34:17.505 --> 34:18.917
Nothing!

34:18.918 --> 34:20.918
Marcellus, you are family.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.138
No, I'm not.

34:25.050 --> 34:26.925
Not anymore.

34:28.288 --> 34:30.012
Never again.

34:30.014 --> 34:34.149
I am not your family.

34:35.351 --> 34:36.768
Marcel, come on.

34:37.521 --> 34:39.353
No!

34:43.686 --> 34:44.835
No.

35:01.694 --> 35:03.212
Vincent was right.

35:07.218 --> 35:09.568
Davina wouldn't have wanted you dead.

35:13.645 --> 35:14.940
Thing is,

35:15.542 --> 35:17.742
she was the only one

35:18.144 --> 35:21.062
keeping me from being...

35:23.023 --> 35:26.984
well, me.

36:04.146 --> 36:08.143
You destroyed somebody good
today in order to save people

36:08.145 --> 36:10.061
who have had more than
their share of lifetimes.

36:10.063 --> 36:11.813
I know.

36:14.151 --> 36:16.735
I am so sorry.

36:18.278 --> 36:20.689
I had to preserve my family.

36:20.691 --> 36:21.907
I couldn't just...

36:21.909 --> 36:23.491
Stop, Freya!

36:33.036 --> 36:36.538
You're just much of a
bloodsucker as the rest of them.

38:24.293 --> 38:27.866
Seeking some respite from the darkness?

38:34.521 --> 38:36.825
Perhaps there's solace

38:36.827 --> 38:39.327
in that fact that you
avenged Cami today.

38:39.329 --> 38:41.496
And yet, to do right by Camille,

38:41.498 --> 38:43.848
we sacrifice someone she cared about.

38:46.386 --> 38:48.019
Our family is safe, Klaus.

38:48.021 --> 38:51.223
Our family is fractured.

38:54.149 --> 38:57.896
There is no victory to celebrate today.

38:57.898 --> 38:59.098
My demons won.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.399
Lucien is not your demon.

39:02.087 --> 39:03.674
You may have sired him,

39:03.704 --> 39:05.654
but you did not create that monster.

39:06.332 --> 39:10.794
Today, I feel, we may have
created a new monster entirely.

39:22.256 --> 39:25.090
I'm not in the mood for company.

39:25.092 --> 39:27.726
Neither am I, Marcel.

39:29.012 --> 39:30.428
Neither am I.

39:34.029 --> 39:36.685
But, see,

39:36.687 --> 39:39.280
what happened to Cami,

39:41.365 --> 39:44.192
what happened to Davina...

39:45.779 --> 39:47.329
cannot go unanswered.

39:59.058 --> 40:01.710
I don't like vampires.

40:01.712 --> 40:03.856
I don't like you.

40:04.715 --> 40:07.299
But I do respect you.

40:12.529 --> 40:15.190
Same stuff that made Lucien.

40:15.192 --> 40:17.859
I extracted it from Aurora's heart.

40:17.861 --> 40:20.312
And you decided to bring it to me?

40:20.314 --> 40:21.479
Marcel, you once drove

40:21.481 --> 40:22.864
the Mikaelson's out of this city

40:22.866 --> 40:25.956
by summoning the one
person they fear most.

40:26.763 --> 40:29.070
That was brilliant.

40:29.072 --> 40:31.656
And I want you to do that one more time.

40:31.658 --> 40:35.215
Only this time, you be
the thing that they fear.

40:36.717 --> 40:41.416
New Orleans is our home, Marcel.

40:41.418 --> 40:43.418
And it's time we took it back.
