01:06.718 --> 01:08.556
I heard as soon as the
jury read the verdict

01:08.566 --> 01:10.319
she launched herself
headlong through the window.

01:10.340 --> 01:13.133
I heard she went mad and
attacked everybody with an axe.

01:13.199 --> 01:15.090
How did she get an axe into a courtroom?

01:15.100 --> 01:16.715
She didn't attack anyone.

01:16.756 --> 01:20.202
Annabella Maloney grabbed a fire
axe to smash a window and escape.

01:20.232 --> 01:22.342
Perhaps we should spend less time

01:22.352 --> 01:23.591
talking about Miss Maloney

01:23.606 --> 01:25.563
- and more time looking for her.
- Crabtree.

01:26.210 --> 01:27.897
All transit points are covered, sir.

01:28.146 --> 01:31.739
Thank you. Annabella's
been spotted on Bismarck St.

01:32.122 --> 01:34.100
That's all the way
up by Yonge and Bloor.

01:34.124 --> 01:36.891
Well, she may have been trying
to get to North Toronto Station.

01:37.016 --> 01:38.660
If she did... look.

01:39.144 --> 01:41.020
This line goes right through Claremont.

01:41.066 --> 01:44.844
- Her hometown.
- Hold it. Nesbit Daniels' office is at Yonge and Bloor.

01:45.081 --> 01:47.018
You think the lawyer's involved in this?

01:47.492 --> 01:50.142
No stone unturned. You two look into it.

01:50.381 --> 01:51.508
Right.

01:57.849 --> 01:59.589
This lock's been broken.

01:59.714 --> 02:01.633
Someone's clearly been in here.

02:02.795 --> 02:05.292
It looks as though she was
trying to find something.

02:14.255 --> 02:16.099
John, look at this.

02:16.798 --> 02:18.201
The back door is open.

02:28.286 --> 02:29.790
That's her!

02:33.031 --> 02:35.386
She must have climbed over.

02:37.537 --> 02:41.167
- I hear footsteps running south.
- We'll head off! This way!

02:41.292 --> 02:42.994
My truncheon.

02:43.244 --> 02:44.529
John!

02:45.013 --> 02:46.491
Coming!

02:58.400 --> 03:00.056
Stop struggling!

03:07.573 --> 03:09.754
Constable Brackenreid!

03:09.760 --> 03:12.456
I hear you've caught a very big fish.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.373
I'd simply forgotten my truncheon, sir.

03:14.383 --> 03:16.621
Now now, no false modesty, Constable.

03:16.646 --> 03:18.185
Young Brackenreid here noticed that

03:18.195 --> 03:19.618
his truncheon had fallen to the ground,

03:19.642 --> 03:22.287
which means the lid upon which
he rested it must have moved.

03:22.318 --> 03:23.750
Clever deduction.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.319
It's a shame your father wasn't
here to pat you on the back himself.

03:26.343 --> 03:30.823
Inspector Brackenreid will hear all
about this the moment he gets back.

03:31.751 --> 03:33.635
Any idea when that may be?

03:34.259 --> 03:37.771
- Last I heard, he was headed to New York.
- Oh...

03:38.683 --> 03:40.059
Good for him.

03:41.563 --> 03:44.446
Was anything found in
Miss Maloney's possession?

03:44.488 --> 03:47.102
Thirty-six dollars in
cash. Mostly twos and fours.

03:47.347 --> 03:51.149
- Has the lawyer been contacted?
- Yes. Mr. Nesbit will be in shortly.

03:52.163 --> 03:54.800
- Very good, John.
- Thank you, sir.

03:57.073 --> 03:58.993
Do you think I'll get
a chance to meet him?

03:59.094 --> 04:01.609
Who? The lawyer? What do
you want to meet him for?

04:01.691 --> 04:04.602
I followed the trial.
I felt sorry for her.

04:04.826 --> 04:07.150
John, she killed her mother with an axe.

04:07.275 --> 04:10.024
Harriet Rawlins wasn't her
mother. Annabella was a home-child.

04:10.044 --> 04:12.975
- So that makes it all right?
- She was beaten and tortured.

04:12.990 --> 04:14.320
Her home-sister admitted as much.

04:14.343 --> 04:17.168
The home-sister that
Annabella then tried to murder?

04:17.178 --> 04:19.151
Rosemary Rawlins was abusive as well.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.413
That's what made it
such a brilliant defense.

04:21.434 --> 04:23.178
The victim was painted as a villain.

04:23.213 --> 04:25.220
The villain painted as a victim.

04:25.321 --> 04:28.472
- Annabella Cinderella.
- So you're a fan of the lawyer as well?

04:28.497 --> 04:32.405
- He took her case for free.
- Nobody's motives are purely altruistic.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.709
It's all in the service of
his political aspirations.

04:34.719 --> 04:36.788
He's running for Mayor, don't you know?

04:37.002 --> 04:39.356
- Here he comes now.
- Mr. Daniels.

04:39.392 --> 04:42.057
- Detective Murdoch. Thank you for coming in.
- Of course.

04:42.092 --> 04:43.377
I'm aware how this might appear,

04:43.397 --> 04:45.880
but I want to assure you that I
had nothing to do with her escape.

04:45.904 --> 04:48.192
Then what was she doing in your office?

04:48.213 --> 04:50.985
She knew that I kept a cashbox
for out-of-pocket expenses.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.268
She tore apart my office
until she found it.

04:53.533 --> 04:55.449
Any idea how much was taken?

04:55.485 --> 04:56.897
- Thirty
- six dollars.

04:57.167 --> 04:59.220
That's the amount that was found on her.

04:59.246 --> 05:00.913
I'll be sure that you get it back.

05:01.138 --> 05:02.605
Her father was a thief.

05:02.666 --> 05:04.491
The apple never falls far from the tree.

05:04.616 --> 05:05.866
Still, you do your best.

05:06.686 --> 05:08.490
Yeah. Right this way.

05:14.152 --> 05:15.885
Alright, alright.

05:18.908 --> 05:21.603
- Hop on it, John.
- Me?

05:21.649 --> 05:24.646
It's only fair that you see this
through and deliver her to prison.

05:25.007 --> 05:27.219
Thank you, sir. I won't let you down.

05:29.645 --> 05:32.677
Try to make Dunbarton by nightfall.
They have a good hotel for the price.

05:32.687 --> 05:34.889
Sir. I'll telegraph from Kingston.

05:50.708 --> 05:53.308
The Police Investigative Handbook.

05:53.409 --> 05:56.731
Yes. Every Station House is to get them.

05:56.757 --> 06:00.120
I suppose it can't hurt to be apprised
of all the latest developments.

06:00.136 --> 06:03.685
Indeed. I've been very
eager to read this.

06:28.218 --> 06:30.154
Can I at least have a fork?

06:31.256 --> 06:32.856
You may have a spoon.

06:32.888 --> 06:35.450
I am handcuffed to the bedpost.

06:36.659 --> 06:38.984
Oh, you think I'm going to stab you.

06:42.475 --> 06:44.792
I believe the word is thank you.

06:45.067 --> 06:46.921
I'm supposed to be grateful?

06:47.046 --> 06:49.354
There's a lot you
should be grateful for.

06:49.621 --> 06:51.424
Are you pulling my leg?

06:51.762 --> 06:54.569
I'm going to prison. For life.

06:54.670 --> 06:57.738
- You could be at the end of a rope.
- Ha! You sound like my lawyer.

06:57.770 --> 07:01.655
- The lawyer who took your case for free?
- The one who bollocked it.

07:01.725 --> 07:05.253
Instead of proving my innocence,
he tries to excuse my guilt.

07:05.278 --> 07:08.546
- But you were guilty.
- Is that so?

07:08.671 --> 07:11.018
- Were you there?
- No, but your sister was.

07:11.235 --> 07:13.515
Rosemary is not my sister.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.706
- She said she saw you kill your mother. Was she lying?
- Yes.

07:16.732 --> 07:19.141
No, she wasn't. She walked into the room

07:19.166 --> 07:21.727
just as you plunged an axe
into your mother's chest.

07:21.766 --> 07:25.594
- She was not my mother!
- Then you chased poor Rosemary through the house,

07:25.633 --> 07:27.270
out the front door and down the lane.

07:27.308 --> 07:29.070
And you probably would have axed her too

07:29.095 --> 07:30.858
if it wasn't for the
neighbour who came out

07:30.906 --> 07:32.958
and wrested the weapon from your grasp.

07:32.975 --> 07:34.690
Or is he lying also?

07:35.613 --> 07:36.913
Not to mention the evidence.

07:36.933 --> 07:40.348
Your footprints in the blood.
Your fingermarks on the weapon.

07:46.957 --> 07:49.333
You were right to give me a spoon.

08:03.748 --> 08:05.780
It's 10 o'clock.

08:06.443 --> 08:08.934
- Did you get any sleep?
- A little.

08:09.246 --> 08:11.106
Wake me at 2.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.732
It's you.

08:22.299 --> 08:25.102
- The one who hates me less.
- I don't hate you.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.402
I feel sorry for you.

08:27.527 --> 08:29.753
Not you too.

08:33.753 --> 08:36.217
How did you become a home-child?

08:37.148 --> 08:39.308
My father was a thief,

08:39.352 --> 08:42.009
my mother was a whore
and I was a pickpocket.

08:42.971 --> 08:44.879
How did you become a copper?

08:45.900 --> 08:48.258
My father is a police inspector.

08:49.971 --> 08:51.940
Not exactly fair, is it?

09:00.004 --> 09:03.100
Right, I'll settle the
bill. You finish up here.

09:20.656 --> 09:22.599
I need to use the privy.

09:22.841 --> 09:25.759
- Again?
- It's a long ride.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.512
This is where she burned
you with cigarettes.

09:37.308 --> 09:40.436
- Only when I made her mad.
- That's awful.

09:41.596 --> 09:43.730
A lot of things are awful.

09:45.928 --> 09:48.082
You're not, though.

09:50.789 --> 09:53.146
We better... we better hurry.

09:54.590 --> 09:56.292
Let me know when you're done.

10:02.809 --> 10:05.216
How do you know so much about my case?

10:05.341 --> 10:07.178
I read about it in the paper.

10:07.235 --> 10:09.458
I even went to watch on my lunch breaks.

10:09.719 --> 10:12.719
You looked at me once. You
probably don't remember.

10:13.344 --> 10:15.146
You smiled.

10:20.707 --> 10:24.198
Are you done? Annabella?

10:26.956 --> 10:28.778
I'm coming in.

10:33.895 --> 10:36.067
Constable Crabtree!

10:38.067 --> 10:40.131
Constable Crabtree!

10:41.685 --> 10:44.169
- What's going on?
- She handcuffed me to the towel rack.

10:44.182 --> 10:45.858
- She's got my key.
- How?

10:45.883 --> 10:48.935
- She's a pickpocket!
- Unlock yourself. Hurry!

10:53.681 --> 10:55.604
Annabella!

11:09.262 --> 11:12.753
God, I'm such a fool!
Detective Murdoch will kill me.

11:13.823 --> 11:15.517
My father is going
to find out, isn't he?

11:15.575 --> 11:17.263
He certainly will if we don't catch her,

11:17.282 --> 11:19.231
which we certainly won't
do standing around here.

11:19.257 --> 11:22.468
- You believe we can catch her?
- Think. Where has she gone?

11:22.500 --> 11:25.194
I imagine she wants to get
as far from us as she can.

11:25.218 --> 11:28.020
- And how would she do that?
- Ride hard.

11:28.863 --> 11:30.480
Horses tire.

11:30.605 --> 11:32.627
Maybe she's going to hide until dark.

11:32.850 --> 11:36.003
- Where's the nearest train station?
- Pickering is just over a mile away.

11:36.017 --> 11:37.909
Right, so what would
you do? Would you...

11:37.934 --> 11:41.737
ride hard or lay low or take a train?

11:42.055 --> 11:43.368
Train.

11:43.864 --> 11:45.520
Let's hurry.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.820
It's ours, all right. I recognize her.

11:50.864 --> 11:52.845
Alright, well, let's go.

11:57.878 --> 12:01.018
Sir, have you seen a young
lady, freckles, blue dress?

12:01.044 --> 12:03.089
She would have been here
only ten minutes ago.

12:03.445 --> 12:05.376
- Pretty?
- Yes, very.

12:05.414 --> 12:07.497
She asked to buy a ticket on the train.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.587
- Which train?
- Westbound. You just missed her.

12:10.644 --> 12:14.062
- What's the next westbound stop?
- Scarborough Junction.

12:14.610 --> 12:17.528
John, I think we're going to
have to alert the authorities.

12:17.553 --> 12:19.853
- Do we have to?
- Ahem!

12:20.241 --> 12:22.375
I don't think we can keep
this a secret anymore.

12:22.401 --> 12:25.764
- I don't think she's on that train.
- Where do you think she's gone?

12:25.783 --> 12:28.733
Her hometown. Look, it's
only ten miles north.

12:28.764 --> 12:30.822
Claremont? Why would she go there?

12:30.847 --> 12:33.032
Maybe she has a friend
who will give her shelter.

12:33.157 --> 12:35.618
Why was the horse
tied up at the station?

12:35.655 --> 12:37.185
Why didn't she give it a
smack and send it running?

12:37.195 --> 12:38.724
It's how we knew she'd been here.

12:38.849 --> 12:41.449
Why did she ask the ticket man if
she could buy a ticket on board?

12:42.102 --> 12:43.929
You can always buy a ticket on board.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.409
She has no money. She wants
us to think she's on the train.

12:46.429 --> 12:49.604
Alright, here. Take this
to the nearest livery.

12:49.635 --> 12:51.887
Get us two saddles and another horse.

12:52.937 --> 12:54.639
Try not to lose that.

12:54.670 --> 12:57.177
Sir, may I use your telephone?

13:05.984 --> 13:08.165
- Station House Four.
- Watts.

13:08.290 --> 13:10.815
- Watts, I need you to do me a favour.
- What?

13:10.940 --> 13:13.099
- We've lost Annabella.
- How?

13:13.124 --> 13:15.968
Never mind that. I need you to
go to the office of Nesbit Daniels

13:15.988 --> 13:18.644
and find the names and
addresses of anybody in Claremont

13:18.664 --> 13:20.820
Annabella might be possibly
seeking shelter with.

13:20.891 --> 13:22.430
And Detective...

13:22.835 --> 13:25.203
if you can find a way to
keeping this between us for now.

13:25.579 --> 13:28.306
I understand. Catching
a killer is one thing.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.503
- Losing a killer is...
- Have you read this?

13:30.743 --> 13:32.480
Goodbye.

13:32.836 --> 13:35.271
- Not yet. Why?
- It's...

13:35.314 --> 13:36.708
it's unacceptable.

13:36.744 --> 13:39.781
Nowhere in the entire book
is there any mention of...

13:39.807 --> 13:41.906
Unacceptable indeed.

13:43.232 --> 13:45.719
Oof, I need to get some air.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.330
Apparently, she's escaped.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.634
Escaped? Again? When?

13:55.735 --> 13:59.121
- About two hours ago.
- And she's going to Claremont?

13:59.187 --> 14:02.473
We need the names of anyone she
might be seeking shelter with.

14:02.474 --> 14:05.176
If she's going to Claremont,
it's not to seek assistance.

14:05.217 --> 14:06.317
Then what?

14:06.345 --> 14:07.571
The moment she was convicted,

14:07.591 --> 14:09.991
she swore to kill every
person responsible.

14:10.047 --> 14:13.559
- Like witnesses.
- Everybody. Including me.

14:13.684 --> 14:16.698
- Especially me.
- Who's everybody?

14:16.823 --> 14:19.726
You'll need to get the complete
file from the Crown Prosecutors.

14:19.851 --> 14:22.936
I'll call the Claremont general
store and see that people are warned.

14:23.232 --> 14:24.669
Alright.

14:32.548 --> 14:34.184
You see what I'm saying.

14:34.205 --> 14:36.962
It's positively antediluvian.

14:37.087 --> 14:40.081
At best, it's a painful
elaboration of the obvious.

14:40.122 --> 14:43.735
Does it include a single technique
developed in the past decade?

14:43.781 --> 14:47.083
- I don't think it does!
- The identikit.

14:47.139 --> 14:49.127
The tele facsimile. Rontgen rays

14:49.155 --> 14:51.089
to peer inside of objects undetected.

14:51.190 --> 14:54.820
Not a single mention of
Landsteiner's blood groupings?

14:54.866 --> 14:57.699
The very idea of employing
scientific knowledge

14:57.709 --> 14:59.274
as an investigative tool...

14:59.324 --> 15:01.134
entirely absent.

15:02.173 --> 15:04.593
Did they even think to consult us?

15:07.540 --> 15:10.245
- I have to get back to work.
- Myself as well.

15:13.716 --> 15:17.329
It's not as though they could have
been entirely unaware of our work.

15:17.355 --> 15:20.697
The Gazette regularly mentions
techniques that you've developed.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.425
And you're celebrated
in your profession.

15:22.461 --> 15:24.377
William. Hardly celebrated.

15:24.402 --> 15:26.768
You're often cited in medical journals.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.550
- You check my citations?
- Of course I do.

15:29.585 --> 15:31.186
I'm proud of you.

15:33.989 --> 15:37.175
To think that public money
is being wasted on this.

16:01.827 --> 16:05.525
- Are you Constable Crabtree?
- Yes. Did you get a message for me?

16:05.563 --> 16:07.131
Oh, we got a message all right.

16:07.150 --> 16:09.103
Are you the ones that let Annabella go?

16:09.124 --> 16:11.152
We didn't let her go. She escaped.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.497
- And now she's out to kill us all.
- What?

16:13.558 --> 16:15.416
- Who told you that?
- Her lawyer.

16:15.541 --> 16:18.460
- It's what she told him, apparently.
- He called.

16:18.516 --> 16:23.047
- I put the word out.
- I'm Annabella's neighbour, Edmund Mathers.

16:23.077 --> 16:26.752
- The one who stopped her from killing her sister.
- Home-sister.

16:26.782 --> 16:28.102
That's me.

16:28.398 --> 16:30.084
You're Rosemary Rawlins.

16:30.808 --> 16:33.729
This is my fiancé, Robert Duncan.

16:34.519 --> 16:37.703
Alright, did Detective
Watts leave a message for me?

16:37.769 --> 16:40.613
Yes. He said he would be
on the 12:15 from Toronto.

16:40.628 --> 16:42.677
What time does it arrive here?

16:42.850 --> 16:44.725
Five past one.

16:49.698 --> 16:52.272
- Detective Watts.
- Mr. Daniels.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.051
It appears we were on the same train.

16:54.076 --> 16:56.069
Everyone is to be gathered
at the general store,

16:56.095 --> 16:59.290
- which I believe is this way.
- Oh.

17:06.833 --> 17:08.676
Why would Annabella want to kill you?

17:08.801 --> 17:10.084
She hated me.

17:10.104 --> 17:11.694
Why did she hate you?

17:12.189 --> 17:15.954
I had nicer things. I had
a mother who wasn't a whore.

17:16.128 --> 17:18.925
I got to run the store instead
of working in the fields.

17:18.957 --> 17:21.867
Who knows? Maybe she was just hateful.

17:22.156 --> 17:24.415
That's the problem with
these home-children.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.015
They're street urchins.

17:26.065 --> 17:29.113
You can put 'em in a nice house,
but you'll never wash the gutter off.

17:29.238 --> 17:31.626
Though Lord knows Mother did try.

17:31.698 --> 17:34.516
Your mother. I heard she was... abusive.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.829
There wasn't one of them that
didn't get what they deserved.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.572
They should have been grateful.

17:39.628 --> 17:42.151
Instead they stole what they
could, and when they were caught

17:42.166 --> 17:44.903
they would run away and Mother
would have to bring in more.

17:45.028 --> 17:47.135
Criminals, the lot of them.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.316
She was horrible.

17:49.723 --> 17:51.222
Annabella?

17:51.425 --> 17:53.041
No.

17:53.723 --> 17:55.797
Her home-mother.

17:56.745 --> 17:58.365
Annabella was no picnic,

17:58.377 --> 18:00.128
but Harriet Rawlins?

18:01.148 --> 18:03.349
The things she did to those children

18:03.382 --> 18:05.194
would turn your stomach.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.085
She burned Annabella with cigarettes.

18:07.210 --> 18:08.777
She did that to all of them.

18:09.355 --> 18:10.708
And worse.

18:11.172 --> 18:13.236
Why didn't you report her?

18:13.822 --> 18:16.478
Because she, um...

18:17.900 --> 18:20.051
she knew my secrets.

18:21.396 --> 18:23.287
Ah, Detective.

18:23.552 --> 18:26.177
- Mr. Daniels.
- Is everyone here?

18:26.610 --> 18:29.792
- Everyone that we telegraphed about, yes.
- Good.

18:29.917 --> 18:32.496
Lady and gentlemen, my
name is Detective Watts

18:32.521 --> 18:36.715
of the Toronto Constabulary. I
trust you all know why you're here.

18:36.816 --> 18:40.996
The danger Annabella poses
to you all is speculative,

18:41.007 --> 18:44.360
but as they say,
"Better sure than sorry."

18:45.324 --> 18:47.501
You all know me as
Miss Maloney's attorney,

18:47.529 --> 18:50.536
but until she's caught I'll be
assisting the police in any way I can.

18:50.592 --> 18:53.431
If any of you know
anything that might help us,

18:53.451 --> 18:55.301
don't keep it to yourselves.

18:56.285 --> 18:58.937
Do you have a space where
we could speak privately?

18:59.399 --> 19:02.987
- Yes, you can use my storage room.
- Alright.

19:03.874 --> 19:05.938
With me, Constables.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.764
Thank you very much, Detective
Watts. For everything.

19:15.121 --> 19:18.072
- You as well, Mr. Daniels.
- And I'm terribly sorry about all of this.

19:18.113 --> 19:20.018
Of course you're sorry.

19:20.143 --> 19:23.382
It doesn't change anything, so
don't waste the energy in saying it.

19:24.050 --> 19:25.897
Does Detective Murdoch know?

19:26.511 --> 19:28.820
No, he doesn't. And
that's not the question

19:28.834 --> 19:30.497
you should be asking right now.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.055
- Sorry, I...
- Nope.

19:33.049 --> 19:35.592
- What is?
- How do we find her?

19:36.545 --> 19:40.984
On the train over, I went through
the file from the Crown Prosecutor.

19:41.794 --> 19:45.392
- There's one more person we should protect.
- Who's that?

19:45.422 --> 19:49.030
The doctor who filed the death
certificate and attended the case.

19:49.045 --> 19:50.961
Dr. Beattie was never called to testify.

19:50.997 --> 19:53.504
He provided evidence
that helped convict her.

19:53.559 --> 19:56.437
- Good point. Let's go.
- No.

19:56.944 --> 19:59.913
You stay. This is police business.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.091
Alright.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.486
I'm not saying she's innocent.

20:12.518 --> 20:13.875
I just pointed out
there are other people

20:13.881 --> 20:15.385
who may have wanted to kill her mother.

20:15.409 --> 20:19.216
Which, if they did, would
ipso facto make her innocent.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.999
- Did she say she was innocent?
- She did, yes.

20:23.732 --> 20:27.304
T'was ever thus.

20:36.284 --> 20:37.569
Oh my God.

20:38.118 --> 20:40.205
Still think she's so innocent?

20:50.753 --> 20:53.694
- This is my fault.
- It's not your fault, John.

20:53.755 --> 20:55.615
Losing the prisoner was your fault.

20:55.646 --> 20:57.236
This is a merely a consequence.

20:57.246 --> 21:00.120
One cannot be held accountable
for every consequence,

21:00.150 --> 21:03.759
because the consequences of
every action are infinite.

21:03.994 --> 21:06.556
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

21:06.593 --> 21:09.466
Your feelings are irrelevant.
It's simply the truth of it.

21:09.591 --> 21:11.392
It does confirm our fears.

21:11.459 --> 21:13.135
The girl's out for bloody revenge.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.723
The choice of the axe was intentional.

21:15.749 --> 21:17.690
She was clearly making a point.

21:18.317 --> 21:21.206
She may be planning to visit
all of her intended victims.

21:21.701 --> 21:24.065
Head back to the store.
Find out where they live.

21:24.090 --> 21:26.995
John and I will join you after
we're done with the crime scene.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.341
What should I do?

21:32.466 --> 21:35.955
Well, this is a doctor's
clinic. Find a thermometer.

21:41.571 --> 21:42.992
Found one.

21:44.007 --> 21:45.628
Here,

21:46.988 --> 21:49.119
take this. Keep it for evidence.

21:49.338 --> 21:50.500
What is it?

21:50.520 --> 21:53.822
- Very likely nothing of importance.
- Then why keep it?

21:54.087 --> 21:56.205
I'll pretend you didn't say that.

21:56.799 --> 21:58.516
Get a pen and paper.

22:00.452 --> 22:03.923
Ambient temperature 76 degrees.

22:03.959 --> 22:08.556
Time... 2:47. He's lightly clothed.

22:08.587 --> 22:10.329
Looks to be about...

22:10.360 --> 22:12.546
160 pounds.

22:16.527 --> 22:18.321
Oh, write that down?

22:18.499 --> 22:21.170
Yes. It affects the algor mortis.

22:21.190 --> 22:22.557
Oh.

22:23.092 --> 22:26.750
A corpse cools at a set rate
according to variables such as weight,

22:26.770 --> 22:29.074
internal temperature
and ambient temperature.

22:29.104 --> 22:32.387
A formula determines the
approximate time of death.

22:32.586 --> 22:34.446
Why are we concerned about that?

22:34.915 --> 22:38.141
Well, as there is no coroner available,

22:38.161 --> 22:40.867
it behooves us to do as best
we can with what we have.

22:40.923 --> 22:43.614
No, no, I mean, we
already know who killed him

22:43.634 --> 22:45.367
and when she must have done it.

22:46.346 --> 22:50.504
You do know our entire system
of justice depends on evidence,

22:50.540 --> 22:53.155
not just casual suppositions of guilt?

22:53.280 --> 22:56.299
- I suppose.
- You suppose?

22:56.365 --> 22:58.678
I mean, yes, of course.

22:58.713 --> 23:00.130
You're right.

23:00.405 --> 23:03.708
For your breathtaking
sloppiness in thinking,

23:03.733 --> 23:06.634
you get to take the
internal temperature.

23:10.847 --> 23:13.004
Not in the mouth.

23:22.376 --> 23:24.531
Hello, I'm Mr. Clements.

23:25.367 --> 23:26.892
Detective William Murdoch.

23:26.958 --> 23:29.466
- My wife, Dr. Julia Ogden.
- Hello.

23:29.499 --> 23:31.254
Your message was urgent.

23:31.591 --> 23:33.191
Yes.

23:33.752 --> 23:37.320
- You are the publisher of this book?
- I am. We are.

23:37.539 --> 23:40.260
- Who is the author?
- I don't know.

23:40.851 --> 23:42.900
You don't know?

23:43.025 --> 23:44.566
We are a subsidiary.

23:44.597 --> 23:46.860
Our parent company originally
commissioned the book

23:46.865 --> 23:48.593
for the New York City Police.

23:48.718 --> 23:50.830
Is there something wrong with the book?

23:52.339 --> 23:55.667
This handbook should
represent the latest

23:55.688 --> 23:59.163
- in investigative techniques, wouldn't you say?
- Of course.

23:59.288 --> 24:01.998
- Well, it does not.
- No.

24:03.729 --> 24:05.696
This is your urgent matter?

24:07.663 --> 24:09.085
Whew.

24:11.924 --> 24:16.139
Here is a list of
investigative tools and methods

24:16.170 --> 24:19.282
that should be included
in any such handbook.

24:19.344 --> 24:22.707
- It's by no means comprehensive.
- How do you know of these?

24:22.743 --> 24:25.621
Detective Murdoch developed
most of them himself.

24:26.891 --> 24:30.169
Your book also lacks
any forensic techniques

24:30.198 --> 24:32.970
which should work hand in glove
in any police investigation.

24:33.021 --> 24:36.932
This is a list of forensic techniques
that should've been included.

24:37.528 --> 24:41.376
And these techniques are effective?

24:41.433 --> 24:43.974
We've solved every crime
we've ever investigated.

24:48.370 --> 24:51.320
So if a handbook of these
techniques were published,

24:51.358 --> 24:55.334
- it would represent a new standard.
- I should think so.

24:56.589 --> 24:58.977
This would be unprecedented.

24:59.710 --> 25:03.316
The subsidiary holding
the rights to the standard.

25:03.379 --> 25:06.896
We don't usually publish
original material.

25:07.221 --> 25:08.998
You must write it.

25:09.099 --> 25:12.661
- What? No, no.
- No. We are not writers.

25:12.703 --> 25:15.104
We could perhaps be...

25:15.205 --> 25:17.547
- involved in...
- Consulting.

25:17.574 --> 25:19.045
- Consulting.
- We can consult.

25:19.070 --> 25:22.578
- Yes.
- This is an advance on royalties.

25:22.791 --> 25:25.262
If this becomes the
North American standard

25:25.387 --> 25:27.520
for police investigative manuals,

25:27.645 --> 25:29.376
multiply that by ten.

25:43.085 --> 25:47.610
- Where is Mr. Duncan?
- He's tending his store. He took his rifle.

25:47.667 --> 25:50.916
We were sorry to hear about Dr. Beattie.

25:51.253 --> 25:52.508
Hm.

25:52.540 --> 25:55.552
Robert says if he sees her,
he's going to shoot her on sight.

25:55.677 --> 25:58.314
I'd advise against that.

25:58.415 --> 26:00.022
Detective Watts.

26:00.470 --> 26:01.999
The numbers we found
in the doctor's pocket

26:02.009 --> 26:04.307
look like the numbers we put
down for his algor mortis.

26:04.348 --> 26:05.673
Hm!

26:05.876 --> 26:09.815
- What does it mean?
- It means he'd recently attended a body of his own.

26:09.940 --> 26:11.951
He was a doctor, after all.

26:12.440 --> 26:15.910
I've visited each of the houses.
No sign she's been to any of them.

26:21.266 --> 26:23.676
- There! It's Annabella!
- Don't shoot!

26:24.390 --> 26:26.199
Dammit, man!

26:38.388 --> 26:39.739
John.

26:40.371 --> 26:42.011
Look.

26:45.110 --> 26:47.062
- Blood.
- She was hit?

26:47.164 --> 26:50.629
It would appear so. Let's look for more.

26:54.095 --> 26:57.632
Congratulations. If you've hit
her and she dies, it's murder.

26:57.713 --> 27:00.960
- Bollocks.
- Not bollocks. Where did you first see her?

27:01.006 --> 27:04.158
She was in my store. I came in
from out back and she bolted.

27:09.037 --> 27:11.184
Do you think she's hurt bad?

27:11.936 --> 27:13.790
Not badly enough.

27:14.070 --> 27:16.166
I can't find any more blood.

27:16.927 --> 27:19.179
I'm worried for her. Is that crazy?

27:19.383 --> 27:21.129
It's not crazy, just stupid, John.

27:21.142 --> 27:22.494
You don't think she would bury an axe

27:22.509 --> 27:24.150
in your chest if she had the chance?

27:25.508 --> 27:26.843
Alright.

27:27.361 --> 27:29.340
She could have gone in any direction.

27:29.391 --> 27:31.114
We're not going to find her like this.

27:43.407 --> 27:44.743
Well?

27:45.023 --> 27:47.301
- She's wounded.
- How bad?

27:47.362 --> 27:49.318
I can't say for sure, but
she'll certainly be looking

27:49.334 --> 27:50.857
for a place to patch herself up.

27:50.929 --> 27:52.916
Any house would have the means.

27:53.100 --> 27:54.302
What do you think, Watts?

27:54.303 --> 27:56.336
Is she out there playing
knockyknockyninedoors?

27:56.346 --> 27:59.822
I think more likely she'll
go somewhere she knows.

27:59.903 --> 28:01.912
- Is that the Crown's file?
- Yes.

28:01.958 --> 28:04.240
Let me have a look. I may
spot something you've missed.

28:06.710 --> 28:08.399
I saw that in your office.

28:09.057 --> 28:11.355
It was on the desk. Maybe
she was looking at it.

28:11.391 --> 28:12.665
Hm.

28:13.583 --> 28:15.743
It's a copy of Dr.
Beattie's medical report

28:15.753 --> 28:17.333
from Harriet Rawlins murder scene.

28:17.348 --> 28:18.983
There's his signature at the bottom.

28:18.984 --> 28:20.605
Why would she look at that?

28:20.834 --> 28:22.832
I would guess she wanted his address.

28:22.957 --> 28:25.512
Everyone knows where
the town doctor lives.

28:27.101 --> 28:31.700
- John, read me the numbers we found on the doctor.
- Of course.

28:35.313 --> 28:36.752
11:15.

28:36.791 --> 28:40.104
- That's the time he took the reading.
- 4 over 20.

28:40.174 --> 28:43.412
- That's April 20th, the date.
- One twenty five.

28:43.513 --> 28:46.951
- Her weight.
- 73.2 and 91.6.

28:46.977 --> 28:50.767
Those would be the ambient
and internal temperatures.

28:53.793 --> 28:57.010
- She was trying to prove her innocence.
- How so?

28:57.271 --> 28:59.979
Those numbers give you the
time of death, do they not?

29:00.011 --> 29:02.213
You can work it out if you
know what the formula is.

29:02.254 --> 29:04.496
So maybe she has an alibi for
when Harriet was actually killed.

29:04.501 --> 29:07.053
Maybe she was hoping the
doctor would do the calculation.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.569
Why else would he have the numbers
from Annabella's file in his pocket?

29:10.956 --> 29:12.709
Yes, I see your point, but

29:12.834 --> 29:15.690
- why would she then kill the doctor?
- Maybe she didn't.

29:16.046 --> 29:17.417
So who did?

29:18.217 --> 29:23.048
Harriet Rawlins was dead four
and a half hours at 11:15 PM.

29:23.053 --> 29:26.957
That puts the time of
death close to 6:45.

29:27.563 --> 29:30.586
Rosemary claims she saw
Annabella kill her at 9 o'clock.

29:33.633 --> 29:35.376
She is innocent.

29:43.658 --> 29:46.680
You're saying she was
innocent? That can't be.

29:46.920 --> 29:49.396
You never thought to ask
for the time of death?

29:49.651 --> 29:51.603
There was no doubt of her guilt.

29:51.613 --> 29:53.136
So much evidence
compelled that conclusion,

29:53.152 --> 29:55.379
I focused on saving her from the noose.

29:55.445 --> 29:59.211
Rosemary claims she saw Annabella
kill her mother at 9:00 PM.

29:59.262 --> 30:02.983
- Was she lying?
- But the neighbour corroborated her testimony.

30:02.998 --> 30:04.823
- Is he lying?
- He only saw Annabella

30:04.838 --> 30:07.148
chasing Rosemary with the axe.
He didn't see the actual murder.

30:07.172 --> 30:09.323
That doesn't make her innocent.

30:09.328 --> 30:12.233
If she didn't kill her at 9, she
could have killed her earlier.

30:12.268 --> 30:13.379
I don't think so.

30:13.405 --> 30:16.014
- What's your reasoning?
- The doctor was murdered.

30:16.090 --> 30:18.237
He didn't do the calculation
yet, so she had no motive.

30:18.261 --> 30:19.907
But the real killer did.

30:20.032 --> 30:22.980
Rosemary says she witnessed the murder.

30:23.016 --> 30:24.112
Hm.

30:24.237 --> 30:26.537
- I'll talk to her first.
- May I join you?

30:26.583 --> 30:29.000
I'd like to give her the
cross-examination I should have in court.

30:29.024 --> 30:31.134
You two talk to Robert Duncan.

30:31.149 --> 30:34.024
Find out what Annabella was
looking for in his store.

30:40.525 --> 30:43.263
The two of us, writing a book!

30:43.388 --> 30:46.937
- I can't argue with the logic of it.
- Neither can I.

30:47.396 --> 30:50.857
A comprehensive manual of
the techniques we've developed

30:50.882 --> 30:53.888
would be an invaluable
contribution to crime detection.

30:53.929 --> 30:55.698
But will you have the time?

30:55.723 --> 30:58.843
You're a practicing surgeon,
still overseeing the morgue.

30:58.968 --> 31:01.545
I already make the
time to spend with you.

31:01.546 --> 31:03.290
We'll just put that time to better use.

31:03.744 --> 31:05.275
Very efficient.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.384
It's positively romantic.

31:19.435 --> 31:22.565
I didn't lie. I came home at 9 o'clock.

31:22.585 --> 31:24.914
I went up to my mother's
room to tell her I was home

31:24.944 --> 31:27.874
and I saw Annabella
put an axe in her chest.

31:27.999 --> 31:29.433
I saw it.

31:29.693 --> 31:31.421
With my own eyes.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.587
Why would I lie about that?

31:34.153 --> 31:37.547
- Well, perhaps you killed her.
- My own mother?

31:39.384 --> 31:42.806
- I loved her.
- Nevertheless, your mother was killed

31:42.836 --> 31:44.345
two hours before you came home.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.909
So either you're lying or you're
mistaken about what you saw.

31:46.929 --> 31:48.469
She was standing over her.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.267
She had the axe in her hands.

31:51.343 --> 31:55.023
But you never saw her
bring the axe down, did you?

31:55.257 --> 31:58.498
Could Annabella in fact have been
removing it from your mother's chest?

31:58.880 --> 32:00.980
Then why did she chase after me?

32:01.158 --> 32:03.955
Perhaps Annabella was trying
to tell you the truth...

32:04.032 --> 32:06.126
she'd only just come home herself

32:06.136 --> 32:08.302
and discovered your mother already dead.

32:09.821 --> 32:12.369
She kept screaming for me to stop.

32:16.146 --> 32:18.414
I thought she was trying
to kill me, I really did.

32:18.481 --> 32:20.376
If she's really innocent,

32:20.501 --> 32:22.259
I feel terrible.

32:23.964 --> 32:25.432
Oh my God.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.317
Robert shot her.

32:28.627 --> 32:31.404
She was going through my ledger.

32:31.460 --> 32:32.897
Why?

32:33.126 --> 32:34.763
Damned if I know.

32:35.691 --> 32:37.306
This is the way she left it.

32:37.494 --> 32:41.455
- April 7th to the 21st.
- Harriet Rawlins was killed on the 20th.

32:41.703 --> 32:44.040
Why would Annabella look at
the day her mother was killed?

32:44.064 --> 32:45.985
Did she buy something?
Is that her alibi?

32:46.000 --> 32:47.606
Even if it is, it wouldn't hold up.

32:47.621 --> 32:50.312
Her house is just a few
minutes' walk from here.

32:50.908 --> 32:54.124
Look. This part has
different handwriting.

32:55.352 --> 32:58.563
Perhaps Annabella wasn't so
much trying to prove an alibi.

32:58.688 --> 33:00.744
She was pointing a
finger at someone else.

33:05.799 --> 33:09.006
This is my father's writing. He
mans the store when I'm not here.

33:09.107 --> 33:10.707
Where were you?

33:11.823 --> 33:13.243
I can't recall.

33:13.704 --> 33:17.907
The last entry you wrote was for a
jacket purchased by Edmund Mathers.

33:17.908 --> 33:19.391
What time was that?

33:19.605 --> 33:23.168
- How would I know that?
- Is Mr. Mathers a farmer?

33:23.219 --> 33:26.379
- No, he works at the mill.
- And what time does the mill close?

33:26.425 --> 33:30.343
- Six o'clock.
- So, you wrote that

33:30.364 --> 33:32.785
and left the store sometime after 6.

33:32.820 --> 33:34.522
Does that jog your memory?

33:35.929 --> 33:37.431
Maybe this will ring a bell.

33:37.432 --> 33:40.286
It was right around the time
that Harriet Rawlins was killed.

33:43.976 --> 33:45.683
You think I killed her.

33:45.808 --> 33:48.869
- Why did you shoot Annabella?
- She was getting away.

33:48.900 --> 33:51.121
Or was she getting at the truth?

33:52.854 --> 33:54.480
You've got this all wrong.

33:54.605 --> 33:56.946
Convince me. Stop lying.

33:57.071 --> 33:58.673
Where were you at the
time of the murder?

33:58.690 --> 34:01.158
And don't say you don't recall.

34:03.958 --> 34:06.363
You have to promise
not to tell Rosemary.

34:06.623 --> 34:08.098
It would be the end for us.

34:08.900 --> 34:10.542
You were with another woman.

34:11.072 --> 34:12.369
Yes.

34:14.726 --> 34:17.193
Give me her name. I'll be discreet.

34:19.935 --> 34:21.672
Good luck finding her.

34:22.141 --> 34:23.920
The other woman was Annabella.

34:29.795 --> 34:31.982
If he's telling the truth,
they both have alibis.

34:32.016 --> 34:34.062
And we're back to where we started.

34:34.107 --> 34:37.324
You mentioned others with
motive to kill Harriet Rawlins?

34:37.522 --> 34:38.581
I did?

34:39.260 --> 34:41.283
Oh, right.

34:41.355 --> 34:43.914
Well, he didn't actually
say he wanted to kill her.

34:43.949 --> 34:45.931
- It was more my speculation as...
- Who?

34:47.898 --> 34:51.460
- Mr. Mathers.
- Alright, let's go talk to him.

34:53.223 --> 34:55.016
Mr. Mathers.

34:57.351 --> 35:01.133
Um, you said Harriet
Rawlins knew your secrets.

35:02.789 --> 35:06.117
And from that, you think I killed her?

35:07.788 --> 35:10.087
She knew everyone's secrets.

35:10.164 --> 35:12.956
It's how she got what she wanted.

35:13.081 --> 35:14.898
What did she want?

35:15.204 --> 35:16.767
You name it.

35:16.868 --> 35:19.947
- Are you saying she extorted you?
- She extorted everyone.

35:20.946 --> 35:22.225
Ask her.

35:23.387 --> 35:27.189
She leaned on people for
favours. It was never about money.

35:29.013 --> 35:31.260
Hm. Miss Rawlins?

35:31.775 --> 35:34.032
When we opened up her estate,

35:34.068 --> 35:37.670
we found a safety deposit box with
a thousand dollars in an envelope.

35:38.022 --> 35:40.000
Good Lord. Where did
the money come from?

35:40.024 --> 35:42.628
- I have no idea.
- But you think it could've been

35:42.644 --> 35:44.769
the fruits of some kind of extortion?

35:45.900 --> 35:48.601
- Possibly.
- Was there anything else in the box?

35:48.810 --> 35:50.710
No. Just some documents.

35:50.731 --> 35:52.489
What kind of documents?

35:53.304 --> 35:55.195
Home-children contracts, mostly.

35:55.256 --> 35:57.478
I still keep them in a
box above the pie safe.

35:57.779 --> 36:00.413
John, why don't you escort Rosemary home

36:00.444 --> 36:02.503
- to retrieve the documents?
- Sir.

36:07.431 --> 36:09.231
I must also take my leave.

36:09.356 --> 36:10.719
In light of this new evidence,

36:10.734 --> 36:12.940
I must petition the
courts to reopen her case.

36:13.006 --> 36:15.264
Right. Well, thank you
for your assistance.

36:15.962 --> 36:17.561
Thank you.

36:22.831 --> 36:24.601
What are we playing?

36:26.765 --> 36:28.304
They're right here.

36:32.921 --> 36:34.664
I don't understand.

36:34.918 --> 36:36.794
I kept them right here.

36:43.144 --> 36:44.724
They've been burned.

36:45.402 --> 36:46.599
Annabella?

36:46.625 --> 36:49.226
Why would Annabella want to
burn her home-child contract?

36:53.000 --> 36:54.809
- What is it?
- Blood.

36:54.875 --> 36:57.708
Annabella?

36:58.921 --> 37:00.782
She's trying to escape!

37:01.026 --> 37:02.632
Annabella!

37:03.253 --> 37:05.444
Annabella, stop!

37:07.004 --> 37:09.143
- We know you're innocent!
- Liar!

37:09.148 --> 37:10.539
She was dead when you found her.

37:10.575 --> 37:12.950
That's why you went to the
doctor. To prove it and you did.

37:13.240 --> 37:16.375
She was killed around 6:30.
You have an alibi for that time.

37:16.451 --> 37:18.041
Mr. Duncan told us.

37:25.481 --> 37:27.290
Nobody believed me.

37:27.652 --> 37:29.166
Not even my lawyer.

37:29.752 --> 37:31.401
Well, we all believe you now.

37:34.873 --> 37:36.387
Let's see that arm.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.113
Why did you burn the
home-child contracts?

37:43.373 --> 37:46.009
Are you protecting someone?
Do you know who killed her?

37:46.134 --> 37:48.797
I didn't burn anything.
Someone else did.

37:49.551 --> 37:52.191
- Who?
- I don't know.

37:52.316 --> 37:53.857
I was hiding.

37:53.888 --> 37:56.763
They came into the house. I
smelled smoke and they left.

37:56.783 --> 37:59.703
- How long ago?
- Just before you got here.

38:02.693 --> 38:04.615
Rosemary, run to the
store. Tell Detective Watts

38:04.630 --> 38:06.538
and Constable Crabtree to
meet me at the train station.

38:06.562 --> 38:08.269
Hurry.

38:09.607 --> 38:12.310
Why are we here, Constable?

38:13.111 --> 38:15.577
Mr. Daniels is our killer, sir.

38:17.121 --> 38:20.082
He knew about the documents and
left ahead of us to destroy them.

38:20.118 --> 38:23.670
Ridiculous. Why would I do such a thing?

38:23.706 --> 38:26.998
- Yes. Why, Constable?
- I don't know. But you did.

38:27.064 --> 38:29.954
And who have I supposedly
killed? Harriet Rawlins?

38:29.975 --> 38:31.722
She was dead before I met her.

38:31.743 --> 38:34.071
Dr. Beattie was dead before I arrived.

38:34.087 --> 38:35.687
Your Detective will attest to that.

38:35.733 --> 38:38.118
Did you meet on the train
or after you arrived?

38:38.164 --> 38:39.530
After.

38:40.957 --> 38:42.318
Go on.

38:44.375 --> 38:47.531
That's all I have.

38:47.887 --> 38:49.661
Well, that's my train.

38:49.701 --> 38:51.317
It's been a nice chat.

38:51.442 --> 38:54.829
Annabella, I'm happy to continue
to represent you if you choose.

38:58.823 --> 39:00.456
Roll up your sleeve.

39:01.149 --> 39:02.999
I've got a train to catch, son.

39:03.952 --> 39:05.338
Mr. Daniels,

39:06.531 --> 39:08.446
roll up your sleeve, please.

39:20.560 --> 39:22.542
Look, it's just like Annabella's.

39:22.614 --> 39:25.101
You were one of Harriet
Rawlins' home-children.

39:25.116 --> 39:27.165
Odd that you never mentioned that.

39:27.180 --> 39:29.897
- He didn't want anybody to know.
- Why?

39:29.958 --> 39:31.859
No shame in being a home-child.

39:31.915 --> 39:34.722
Unless, of course, you
have political ambitions.

39:35.293 --> 39:37.060
What were you trying to hide?

39:37.161 --> 39:38.887
Were your parents criminals?

39:39.901 --> 39:43.000
You may as well tell us.
It's all going to come out.

39:45.905 --> 39:47.637
My father was a murderer.

39:47.923 --> 39:51.287
And that was the secret Harriet
Rawlins was going to tell the world.

39:51.511 --> 39:54.329
That money they found. You
paid her to keep her quiet.

39:54.454 --> 39:56.678
But she wouldn't have
stayed quiet, of course.

39:57.005 --> 39:58.351
So you killed her.

39:58.476 --> 40:01.265
And then Annabella came
home at just the wrong time.

40:01.321 --> 40:03.905
You became my lawyer just so
you could see me convicted.

40:03.931 --> 40:05.597
I should have let you hang.

40:15.866 --> 40:18.011
Let's take that train ride, shall we?

40:28.785 --> 40:30.569
So what will you do now?

40:30.885 --> 40:32.475
I'm going to Berlin.

40:32.816 --> 40:36.134
A home-sister has offered to
put me up until I get on my feet.

40:37.516 --> 40:38.902
Oh.

40:39.529 --> 40:40.833
Thank you.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.218
If it wasn't for you, I'd be
spending my life behind bars.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.037
Constable Brackenreid.

40:46.093 --> 40:47.780
You're wanted in the Station.

40:50.043 --> 40:52.189
I saw you in the courtroom, by the way.

40:52.999 --> 40:54.533
I smiled at you.

40:55.297 --> 40:58.390
- I don't know if you remember.
- I remember.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.611
Oh, uh, I don't know,
fellows. That's my dad's.

41:14.647 --> 41:17.322
It's an established
principle that whiskey

41:17.323 --> 41:19.336
belonging to a man belongs to his son.

41:19.367 --> 41:22.165
Oh yes, says so in the
bible. Corinthians, I believe.

41:22.290 --> 41:23.662
To Annabella.

41:23.713 --> 41:27.409
May all criminals be as innocent.

41:28.036 --> 41:29.804
And as pretty.

41:30.166 --> 41:31.495
To Annabella.

41:36.780 --> 41:38.951
I understand you lost your prisoner.

41:39.930 --> 41:41.724
I did, sir.

41:42.386 --> 41:44.664
But you're since recaptured her.

41:46.039 --> 41:49.071
- That's right.
- And it turns out she was innocent.

41:49.601 --> 41:52.526
You found all this out
and caught the real killer.

41:53.041 --> 41:55.110
But none of this would have happened

41:55.166 --> 41:57.387
if you hadn't lost
her in the first place.

41:58.820 --> 42:01.154
Well, I suppose that's true.

42:02.591 --> 42:04.121
Well, Constable Brackenreid,

42:04.131 --> 42:07.326
that isn't generally how
we carry out our work here.

42:11.280 --> 42:14.501
But it seems all's well that ends well.

42:15.689 --> 42:17.269
Good work, John.

42:18.196 --> 42:19.715
Thank you, sir.

42:20.112 --> 42:21.738
- Good night.
- Good night.

42:23.848 --> 42:25.066
I've a toast to make.

42:25.127 --> 42:26.819
- Go on.
- To my father.

42:26.865 --> 42:29.331
May he never find out about this.

42:30.596 --> 42:32.237
Cheers.

42:34.224 --> 42:37.195
So, where would you like to begin?

42:37.256 --> 42:40.227
- How about the title?
- Ah, yes. Yes.

42:40.242 --> 42:41.771
I was thinking...

42:43.453 --> 42:47.069
Crime Detection: Reasoning and Methods.

42:47.170 --> 42:48.605
That's rather dry.

42:48.730 --> 42:50.394
It's what the book is about.

42:50.455 --> 42:52.784
Yes, but there's no point writing a book

42:52.825 --> 42:55.802
if the readers are going to
be asleep before they open it.

42:56.897 --> 42:58.865
Well, what title would
you suggest, then?

42:58.890 --> 43:01.408
I'm not sure, but
certainly not that one.

43:01.533 --> 43:04.078
Criticism without solution is no answer.

43:04.312 --> 43:06.366
Now William, if you
want to become a writer,

43:06.376 --> 43:08.761
you're going to need to
develop a thicker skin.

43:09.148 --> 43:10.331
Fine.

43:11.258 --> 43:13.923
How about a bit of alliteration?

43:14.531 --> 43:16.879
Puzzles and Poisons:

43:16.945 --> 43:18.881
A Diagnosis of Murder?

43:18.902 --> 43:21.756
- Ooh, that's good!
- What?

43:21.817 --> 43:25.052
I was joking. Nonsense!
I'm writing it down.

43:25.114 --> 43:28.024
Puzzles and Poisons...

43:28.080 --> 43:29.548
What was it?

43:29.996 --> 43:32.606
- A Diagnosis...
- A Diagnosis...

43:32.611 --> 43:35.037
I suppose we'll need an introduction.

43:35.260 --> 43:38.356
"Hello. You have
stumbled upon a murder."

43:38.388 --> 43:41.089
- No, William, that's nonsense.
- No.
