<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.040 --> 00:23.150
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.150 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.490 --> 00:29.290
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.220 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

01:56.310 --> 01:57.260
<b>Leorio!</b>

02:05.690 --> 02:06.790
<b>Leorio!</b>

02:07.640 --> 02:12.650
<b>Big x Time x Interview</b>

02:16.260 --> 02:19.660
<b>Gon's group has been trapped by 
the vipers that block the exit.</b>

02:19.900 --> 02:23.030
<b>But the vipers' master, Bourbon,</b>

02:23.030 --> 02:25.150
<b>is already dead.</b>

02:26.960 --> 02:30.470
<b>The one who set this trap is dead?</b>

02:30.470 --> 02:31.420
<b>How?</b>

02:32.080 --> 02:33.420
<b>I killed him.</b>

02:35.010 --> 02:36.920
<b>I won't tell you how.</b>

02:38.240 --> 02:40.170
<b>Gon, take Leorio.</b>

02:40.170 --> 02:40.990
<b>Okay.</b>

02:59.400 --> 03:00.220
<b>It's no use.</b>

03:01.980 --> 03:04.700
<b>You won't be able to search his body.</b>

03:05.210 --> 03:09.170
<b>The snakes are trained to attack</b>

03:09.170 --> 03:13.960
<b>the moment anyone tries to touch 
their master or to leave the cave.</b>

03:18.310 --> 03:20.710
<b>So you used poison to fight poison.</b>

03:21.580 --> 03:23.040
<b>Judging from his wounds,</b>

03:23.040 --> 03:25.220
<b>you must have used Neurotoxic Bees.</b>

03:25.220 --> 03:28.220
<b>He probably died from anaphylactic shock.</b>

03:28.650 --> 03:30.980
<b>Anaphylactic shock?</b>

03:32.360 --> 03:35.900
<b>When a bee stings a human,</b>

03:35.900 --> 03:38.690
<b>the human produces antibodies 
to counter the venom.</b>

03:39.740 --> 03:44.500
<b>But if that human is stung again 
by the same kind of bee,</b>

03:44.500 --> 03:46.240
<b>they experience an allergic reaction.</b>

03:47.030 --> 03:49.110
<b>An extreme allergic reaction</b>

03:49.110 --> 03:51.010
<b>is known as anaphylactic shock.</b>

03:51.490 --> 03:54.460
<b>Depending on the circumstances, 
it can be fatal.</b>

03:54.460 --> 03:56.830
<b>You got me. 
That's exactly what happened.</b>

03:56.830 --> 03:59.000
<b>So you used bees to kill him?</b>

04:00.720 --> 04:02.760
<b>Bourbon was my target.</b>

04:11.300 --> 04:14.040
<b>After confirming that he'd 
entered the cave,</b>

04:14.870 --> 04:16.770
<b>I sprayed sleeping gas into the entrance,</b>

04:17.570 --> 04:19.760
<b>and waited until it was safe to enter.</b>

04:33.480 --> 04:36.110
<b>Bourbon was sound asleep,</b>

04:36.110 --> 04:39.000
<b>but he'd already set his trap.</b>

04:42.850 --> 04:44.800
<b>The sleeping gas didn't reach</b>

04:44.800 --> 04:47.850
<b>most of the snakes that were hiding</b>

04:47.850 --> 04:50.980
<b>in cracks at the back of the cave.</b>

04:51.530 --> 04:54.870
<b>Well, I jumped back in time,</b>

04:54.870 --> 04:56.940
<b>so I wasn't bitten by snakes.</b>

04:57.250 --> 04:59.940
<b>But that triggered my attack switch.</b>

05:05.110 --> 05:06.950
<b>You keep bees up there?</b>

05:07.830 --> 05:10.910
<b>If I scream or collapse,</b>

05:10.910 --> 05:13.700
<b>they'll attack any nearby humans.</b>

05:15.280 --> 05:17.720
<b>I didn't expect him to die.</b>

05:17.720 --> 05:20.710
<b>How could I have known that he'd 
already been stung once?</b>

05:21.450 --> 05:23.960
<b>And I couldn't help him 
because of the snakes.</b>

05:24.330 --> 05:27.110
<b>Well, it was beyond my control anyway.</b>

05:28.310 --> 05:29.680
<b>You can come back now.</b>

05:33.210 --> 05:36.700
<b>The problem is that he's dead,</b>

05:36.700 --> 05:40.030
<b>but the viper trap is still active.</b>

05:40.850 --> 05:44.490
<b>And we can't ask him or 
look for a way to disarm it.</b>

05:44.800 --> 05:47.350
<b>We're trapped with no escape.</b>

05:49.410 --> 05:50.490
<b>Leorio...</b>

05:52.200 --> 05:54.310
<b>I've already given up.</b>

05:54.860 --> 05:58.040
<b>We just have to wait for the 
examiners to come and save us.</b>

05:58.040 --> 05:59.460
<b>The examiners?</b>

06:00.040 --> 06:02.500
<b>You're saying that they'll 
rescue us from this cave?</b>

06:03.490 --> 06:04.630
<b>You didn't know?</b>

06:05.030 --> 06:08.360
<b>Our ID tags contain a tracking device.</b>

06:08.360 --> 06:11.150
<b>The examiners can locate each applicant.</b>

06:11.150 --> 06:13.650
<b>If someone hasn't returned 
by the deadline,</b>

06:13.650 --> 06:15.770
<b>the examiners will look for them.</b>

06:16.110 --> 06:18.350
<b>Though this won't work if 
you lose your tag</b>

06:18.350 --> 06:20.060
<b>or if someone takes it from you.</b>

06:20.650 --> 06:23.200
<b>Fortunately, there's only one day left.</b>

06:23.200 --> 06:26.600
<b>The best course would be to give up 
for this year and wait for help.</b>

06:26.600 --> 06:28.280
<b>We cannot do that.</b>

06:29.030 --> 06:31.700
<b>Leorio's condition is worsening.</b>

06:31.700 --> 06:33.410
<b>We must take him to a 
doctor immediately.</b>

06:33.960 --> 06:37.160
<b>The examiners won't move until 
the deadline passes.</b>

06:37.160 --> 06:40.420
<b>If you don't have your tag, 
you'll basically be left for dead.</b>

06:42.020 --> 06:43.850
<b>It's his own fault.</b>

06:43.850 --> 06:45.420
<b>I warned him.</b>

06:46.050 --> 06:47.810
<b><i>Kurapika! Gon!</i></b>

06:47.810 --> 06:48.960
<b><i>Don't come in! The snakes...!</i></b>

06:53.580 --> 06:58.450
<b>All you can do is pray that he 
holds out until help arrives.</b>

06:58.950 --> 07:01.620
<b><i>No, there is still a way.</i></b>

07:01.620 --> 07:03.590
<b><i>With a good chance for success.</i></b>

07:04.220 --> 07:07.050
<b><i>But if he isn't carrying any on his person,</i></b>

07:07.050 --> 07:08.770
<b><i>we'll have another victim.</i></b>

07:09.720 --> 07:10.700
<b>Kurapika.</b>

07:11.630 --> 07:13.470
<b>Look after Leorio.</b>

07:13.470 --> 07:14.200
<b>Gon?</b>

07:14.520 --> 07:16.080
<b>I'm sure we'll find some!</b>

07:16.420 --> 07:17.580
<b>Gon...</b>

07:19.130 --> 07:21.080
<b>Hey, Gon!</b>

07:21.550 --> 07:23.710
<b>Wait, what are you doing?</b>

07:24.070 --> 07:25.460
<b>Didn't you hear what I just said?</b>

07:25.460 --> 07:26.490
<b>Hello?</b>

07:38.190 --> 07:39.430
<b>Gon!</b>

07:40.040 --> 07:41.940
<b>H-He's crazy...</b>

07:49.190 --> 07:50.390
<b>Found it!</b>

07:51.580 --> 07:52.600
<b>Kurapika!</b>

07:55.720 --> 07:56.620
<b>Gon!</b>

08:04.470 --> 08:07.320
<b>Use it on Leorio quick...</b>

08:18.390 --> 08:20.020
<b>All right, you're next.</b>

08:20.020 --> 08:21.310
<b>Yeah...</b>

08:22.060 --> 08:23.440
<b>I don't believe it...</b>

08:23.970 --> 08:26.270
<b>He jumped into a nest of 
poisonous snakes</b>

08:26.270 --> 08:29.060
<b>to search for an antidote, 
not even knowing if he had it?</b>

08:29.440 --> 08:31.710
<b>The odds were in his favor.</b>

08:31.710 --> 08:32.320
<b>What?</b>

08:32.320 --> 08:34.590
<b>If you're going to poison someone,</b>

08:34.590 --> 08:38.080
<b>you'd need the antidote at hand, 
as a bargaining chip.</b>

08:38.080 --> 08:41.030
<b>That's true, but...</b>

08:41.030 --> 08:42.580
<b><i>That said,</i></b>

08:42.580 --> 08:44.910
<b><i>it took an incredible amount of courage</i></b>

08:44.910 --> 08:47.080
<b><i>to do what he just did.</i></b>

08:49.200 --> 08:51.090
<b>Leorio's condition is stabilizing.</b>

08:51.660 --> 08:53.220
<b>He should be fine.</b>

08:53.220 --> 08:55.330
<b>You must be really good friends.</b>

08:58.180 --> 09:01.060
<b>Hey, do you have any sleeping gas left?</b>

09:01.620 --> 09:03.120
<b>I do...</b>

09:03.120 --> 09:04.800
<b>Would you trade it for this?</b>

09:04.800 --> 09:05.560
<b>Ah!</b>

09:05.940 --> 09:07.540
<b>That's Bourbon's!</b>

09:08.170 --> 09:11.320
<b>This gives you six points, right?</b>

09:11.320 --> 09:13.230
<b>Yes, that's right.</b>

09:13.230 --> 09:17.180
<b>But what are you going to do 
with the sleeping gas?</b>

09:17.180 --> 09:20.950
<b>Put all the snakes to sleep, 
so we can escape.</b>

09:21.230 --> 09:25.710
<b>It'd be more effective than when 
I sprayed the gas from outside.</b>

09:25.990 --> 09:28.710
<b>Within five minutes, the entire 
cave will fill with gas,</b>

09:28.710 --> 09:31.210
<b>and the snakes will be asleep.</b>

09:31.790 --> 09:33.280
<b>But it'll take five minutes!</b>

09:33.280 --> 09:36.090
<b>No one can hold their breath that long.</b>

09:36.370 --> 09:40.520
<b>There's no point if we put 
ourselves to sleep in the process.</b>

09:40.520 --> 09:42.610
<b>Nine minutes and forty-four seconds.</b>

09:42.610 --> 09:43.220
<b>Huh?</b>

09:43.540 --> 09:45.360
<b>That's my record.</b>

09:46.470 --> 09:49.500
<b>I'll hold my breath and carry 
everyone out of here.</b>

09:50.520 --> 09:52.220
<b>I can't trust you.</b>

09:52.220 --> 09:54.960
<b>You might escape by yourself.</b>

09:54.960 --> 09:57.850
<b>You really think he'd do that, 
after jumping into</b>

09:57.850 --> 10:00.830
<b>a nest of poisonous snakes to save Leorio?</b>

10:01.600 --> 10:02.860
<b>Trust me.</b>

10:04.550 --> 10:07.330
<b>I'll get you out of here!</b>

10:16.810 --> 10:18.320
<b>It's ready.</b>

10:18.320 --> 10:21.120
<b>On my signal, release the gas.</b>

10:21.470 --> 10:22.510
<b>Got it.</b>

10:39.230 --> 10:41.780
<b><i>199, 200,</i></b>

10:41.780 --> 10:45.790
<b><i>201, 202, 203,</i></b>

10:45.790 --> 10:50.790
<b><i>204, 205, 206, 207...</i></b>

11:03.530 --> 11:06.580
<b>Yes!</b>

11:15.600 --> 11:18.190
<b>Well, I'll leave Bourbon's tag with you,</b>

11:18.460 --> 11:20.450
<b>so the examiners will find you.</b>

11:24.020 --> 11:25.570
<b>If I give Leorio your tag,</b>

11:25.570 --> 11:28.450
<b>he'll have six points and pass.</b>

11:29.220 --> 11:31.580
<b>Consider it the fee for carrying 
you out of there.</b>

11:31.580 --> 11:32.770
<b>Sorry.</b>

11:37.500 --> 11:41.430
<b>The Fourth Phase of the exam 
has just ended.</b>

11:42.040 --> 11:43.690
<b>Will the applicants please return</b>

11:43.690 --> 11:46.560
<b>to the starting point at once?</b>

11:47.070 --> 11:50.980
<b>You will be given one hour of extra time.</b>

11:51.330 --> 11:56.570
<b>If you do not return during this time, 
you will fail the exam.</b>

11:57.290 --> 11:59.700
<b>Furthermore, you are not allowed 
to exchange tags</b>

11:59.700 --> 12:01.630
<b>after reaching the starting point.</b>

12:02.290 --> 12:06.870
<b>Anyone caught swapping tags 
will be disqualified.</b>

<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

12:14.120 --> 12:18.170
<b>Ponzu</b>

12:25.000 --> 12:29.100
<b>Then we will now check the

12:29.910 --> 12:31.920
<b>#44 Hisoka-san.</b>

12:32.750 --> 12:34.950
<b>#53, Pokkle-san.</b>

<b>#99, Killua-san.</b>

<b>#294, Hanzo-san.</b>

<b>So six applicants have passed?</b>

12:51.420 --> 12:52.080
<b>Oh?</b>

12:57.910 --> 12:58.700
<b>Gon.</b>

12:58.700 --> 13:02.090
<b>Ah, three more arrive at the last second.</b>

13:02.610 --> 13:03.590
<b>Killua.</b>

13:12.490 --> 13:15.100
<b>And now for the last few members...</b>

13:15.760 --> 13:17.980
<b>#404, Kurapika-san.</b>

13:18.830 --> 13:21.540
<b>#403, Leorio-san.</b>

<b>And #405, Gon-san.</b>

13:26.350 --> 13:28.440
<b>These nine applicants have passed</b>

13:28.440 --> 13:31.520
<b>the Fourth Phase of the exam!</b>

13:36.010 --> 13:38.780
<b>Six of the nine are rookies?</b>

13:38.780 --> 13:40.380
<b>Marvelous, marvelous.</b>

13:40.640 --> 13:43.380
<b>Has this ever happened before?</b>

13:43.730 --> 13:46.690
<b>Hmm, there's a trend where</b>

13:46.690 --> 13:51.740
<b>we'll go many years without 
a single rookie qualifying.</b>

13:51.740 --> 13:53.030
<b>Then suddenly,</b>

13:53.030 --> 13:56.350
<b>we'll have a whole bunch 
of promising newbies.</b>

13:56.790 --> 14:00.240
<b>This is the fourth time I've seen it happen.</b>

14:00.740 --> 14:04.530
<b>By the way, what are we doing 
for the Final Phase?</b>

14:04.910 --> 14:06.410
<b>Oh, right.</b>

14:06.410 --> 14:08.980
<b>You haven't told us yet.</b>

14:08.980 --> 14:10.910
<b>Yes, about that...</b>

14:11.540 --> 14:14.660
<b>I intend to have them participate 
in a rather peculiar fight.</b>

14:15.150 --> 14:17.540
<b>Hmm? A rather peculiar fight?</b>

14:18.020 --> 14:20.810
<b>First, I want to talk to each of the</b>

14:20.810 --> 14:22.970
<b>nine remaining applicants.</b>

14:27.520 --> 14:29.330
<b>Pathetic...</b>

14:30.020 --> 14:31.560
<b>I needed the two of you</b>

14:31.560 --> 14:34.370
<b>to do everything for me during 
the Fourth Phase.</b>

14:34.980 --> 14:37.700
<b>I promise I'll return the favor.</b>

14:37.700 --> 14:38.490
<b>So...</b>

14:39.750 --> 14:40.820
<b>Thanks.</b>

14:42.110 --> 14:44.440
<b>I have an announcement for all applicants.</b>

14:45.110 --> 14:47.560
<b>The chairman wishes to interview 
the remaining candidates.</b>

14:47.560 --> 14:48.670
<b>Interview?</b>

14:48.670 --> 14:50.370
<b>When your number is called,</b>

14:50.370 --> 14:52.570
<b>please come to the first reception room, 
on the second floor.</b>

14:53.230 --> 14:58.440
<b>Then we will start with #44, Hisoka-sama.</b>

15:04.770 --> 15:07.090
<b>Well, have a seat.</b>

15:07.360 --> 15:10.220
<b>Don't tell me that this is 
the exam's Final Phase.</b>

15:10.550 --> 15:13.550
<b>It may be related...</b>

15:13.550 --> 15:18.410
<b>I'll just be asking a few questions 
to satisfy my curiosity.</b>

15:23.360 --> 15:27.320
<b>First, why do you want to 
become a Hunter?</b>

15:27.320 --> 15:29.810
<b>I'm not particularly interested in 
becoming a Hunter, but...</b>

15:30.160 --> 15:30.860
<b>But?</b>

15:31.420 --> 15:34.620
<b>A Hunter License can be very useful.</b>

15:34.620 --> 15:36.550
<b>Oh, any examples?</b>

15:36.550 --> 15:37.750
<b>For example,</b>

15:38.590 --> 15:42.620
<b>Hunters usually can't be punished 
when they kill someone.</b>

15:43.220 --> 15:44.490
<b>I see.</b>

15:44.490 --> 15:46.630
<b>Then I'll move on to the next question.</b>

15:46.930 --> 15:49.240
<b>Which of the other eight applicants</b>

15:49.240 --> 15:51.380
<b>are you keeping an eye on?</b>

15:53.550 --> 15:55.010
<b>#99.</b>

15:55.370 --> 15:56.260
<b>Ah...</b>

15:56.700 --> 15:59.190
<b>#405 is also on my radar,</b>

15:59.190 --> 16:00.860
<b>but it's #99 I'm keeping an eye on.</b>

16:01.140 --> 16:03.400
<b>I would love to take him on one day.</b>

16:06.010 --> 16:08.680
<b>One last question.</b>

16:08.680 --> 16:13.030
<b>Which of the other eight applicants 
would you least want to fight?</b>

16:14.150 --> 16:16.710
<b>That would be #405.</b>

16:16.710 --> 16:18.980
<b>Though #99 is also up there.</b>

16:20.340 --> 16:22.950
<b>If you're asking whom I least 
want to fight at this moment,</b>

16:22.950 --> 16:25.920
<b>my answer would be #405.</b>

16:25.920 --> 16:27.290
<b>Ah, I understand.</b>

16:29.000 --> 16:32.600
<b>I should mention that the one I most 
want to fight at this moment</b>

16:33.130 --> 16:35.270
<b>is you.</b>

16:36.330 --> 16:38.750
<b>Yep, nice job.</b>

16:38.750 --> 16:40.560
<b>You're excused.</b>

16:45.810 --> 16:48.070
<b><i>That old man is too crafty...</i></b>

16:51.430 --> 16:55.320
<b><i>He left himself so undefended, 
I lost my edge.</i></b>

17:00.490 --> 17:03.330
<b>I'm watching out for #404.</b>

17:03.330 --> 17:05.670
<b>He looks to be the most 
balanced applicant left.</b>

17:06.440 --> 17:08.830
<b>I definitely don't want to fight #44.</b>

17:09.480 --> 17:11.920
<b>To be honest, I doubt I can beat him.</b>

17:13.950 --> 17:16.280
<b>Has to be Gon. 
Since we're the same age.</b>

17:16.990 --> 17:20.240
<b>I don't want to fight #53.</b>

17:20.240 --> 17:22.350
<b>I don't think it'd be a 
very interesting fight.</b>

17:24.480 --> 17:27.650
<b>I've got my eye on #44.</b>

17:27.650 --> 17:29.570
<b>He has real presence.</b>

17:29.570 --> 17:32.960
<b>#405 and #99 are still children.</b>

17:32.960 --> 17:34.950
<b>I couldn't bring myself to fight them.</b>

17:39.560 --> 17:41.210
<b>#99.</b>

17:42.760 --> 17:44.370
<b>#44.</b>

17:46.460 --> 17:48.650
<b>Who am I watching out for?</b>

17:48.650 --> 17:50.680
<b>#44, Hisoka.</b>

17:50.680 --> 17:52.770
<b>A lot's happened, so I've 
been watching him.</b>

17:54.260 --> 17:59.220
<b>I can't choose one out of 
#99, #403, and #404.</b>

18:01.120 --> 18:02.990
<b>It has to be #44.</b>

18:02.990 --> 18:05.440
<b>He's the most dangerous one here.</b>

18:06.000 --> 18:09.650
<b>And #44 is the one I least want to fight.</b>

18:11.540 --> 18:15.320
<b>I'm watching #405 for positive reasons,</b>

18:15.320 --> 18:17.420
<b>and #44 for negative reasons.</b>

18:17.930 --> 18:20.420
<b>If I'm given ample reason, 
I'll fight anyone.</b>

18:20.420 --> 18:22.830
<b>If not, I would prefer not to fight anyone.</b>

18:24.700 --> 18:26.400
<b>#405.</b>

18:26.710 --> 18:29.940
<b>I owe him, and I hope that 
he passes the exam.</b>

18:29.940 --> 18:33.550
<b>So I'm hoping I don't have to fight #405.</b>

18:35.340 --> 18:38.810
<b>Hmm, the results were more lopsided 
than I was expecting.</b>

18:46.730 --> 18:47.510
<b>Gon.</b>

18:48.260 --> 18:50.060
<b>We've reached the Final Phase 
of the exam.</b>

18:50.330 --> 18:51.290
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:56.070 --> 18:59.070
<b>Heart</b>

18:57.110 --> 18:59.070
<b>Yes, that's good.</b>

19:04.200 --> 19:06.200
<b>Sorry to keep you waiting.</b>

19:06.510 --> 19:08.710
<b>I've drawn up the bracket.</b>

19:09.040 --> 19:09.920
<b>Huh?</b>

19:09.920 --> 19:10.580
<b>What is this?</b>

19:11.990 --> 19:13.590
<b>Ch-Chairman?</b>

19:13.970 --> 19:14.790
<b>What?</b>

19:14.790 --> 19:16.590
<b>Are you serious about this?</b>

19:18.990 --> 19:20.340
<b>Dead serious.</b>

19:21.540 --> 19:23.970
<b>He certainly has a serious expression.</b>

19:23.970 --> 19:26.850
<b>Th-That's a serious expression?</b>

19:27.400 --> 19:31.850
<b>Winning will make them Hunters.</b>

19:36.620 --> 19:37.560
<b>Gon...</b>

19:38.240 --> 19:39.040
<b>Hmm?</b>

19:41.630 --> 19:44.200
<b>Did something happen during 
the Fourth Phase?</b>

19:46.830 --> 19:48.600
<b>When we met up,</b>

19:48.600 --> 19:51.370
<b>you were acting a little strange.</b>

19:52.310 --> 19:54.240
<b>And you've been somewhat subdued</b>

19:54.240 --> 19:56.270
<b>since we left Zevil Island.</b>

19:57.840 --> 20:00.940
<b>My target was Hisoka.</b>

20:02.510 --> 20:05.680
<b>I waited for the perfect chance 
and stole his tag,</b>

20:07.770 --> 20:10.660
<b>but someone else was tailing me,</b>

20:10.660 --> 20:12.440
<b>and he got me with a poisoned dart.</b>

20:14.700 --> 20:17.060
<b>Soon after, Hisoka took back his tag</b>

20:17.060 --> 20:21.480
<b>from the person who got me, 
and he left it with me.</b>

20:22.220 --> 20:24.080
<b>He said that I owed him now.</b>

20:24.640 --> 20:25.700
<b>Hisoka said that?</b>

20:26.090 --> 20:27.760
<b>I told him I didn't need his help,</b>

20:27.760 --> 20:29.200
<b>and he sent me flying.</b>

20:34.730 --> 20:36.400
<b><i>I'll only take it back</i></b>

20:36.400 --> 20:39.880
<b><i>when you're able to punch me 
in the face, just like that.</i></b>

20:42.790 --> 20:45.260
<b>I was so mad</b>

20:45.870 --> 20:50.090
<b>that I couldn't do anything against him...</b>

21:07.070 --> 21:12.040
<b>After that, I was pretty 
miserable and lonely.</b>

21:12.040 --> 21:16.040
<b>I felt so helpless,</b>

21:16.350 --> 21:18.760
<b>I wanted company...</b>

21:18.760 --> 21:21.170
<b>I wanted to help someone,</b>

21:21.820 --> 21:23.060
<b>I guess.</b>

21:24.050 --> 21:26.850
<b>That's why I was looking for you two.</b>

21:27.420 --> 21:28.210
<b>Gon.</b>

21:29.480 --> 21:31.380
<b>Leorio and I have only been able</b>

21:31.380 --> 21:34.250
<b>to make it this far because of you.</b>

21:36.560 --> 21:38.650
<b>We're truly grateful.</b>

21:41.510 --> 21:44.610
<b>I'd also like to thank you.</b>

21:49.720 --> 21:52.130
<b>Gon has deepened his bond 
with his friends.</b>

21:52.530 --> 21:55.540
<b>And the nine remaining 
applicants are about</b>

21:55.540 --> 21:58.360
<b>to begin the exam's Final Phase.</b>

23:28.940 --> 23:31.680
<b>Next time: Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!</b>

23:31.680 --> 23:33.100
<b>Then how am I supposed to win?</b>

23:33.100 --> 23:34.320
<b>Just do it!</b>
