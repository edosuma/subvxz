01:03.165 --> 01:05.098
I don't know why this can't
wait until I'm back.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.365
Because you'll be jet lagged
and won't want to come into town

01:07.499 --> 01:09.399
and you'll end up in no shoes
to wear to the wedding.

01:09.598 --> 01:11.598
- You know, how about those?
- No.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.298
- What's wrong with them?
- Horrible.

01:13.432 --> 01:15.764
- What's horrible about 'em?
- Everything.

01:15.897 --> 01:17.830
It's just a basic,
black shoe, isn't it?

01:17.965 --> 01:20.165
- Exactly.
- I can't get anything right.

01:20.298 --> 01:21.730
You could let me
wear my trainers.

01:21.864 --> 01:22.830
You're not wearing
your trainers.

01:22.965 --> 01:24.864
Why not? They're black.

01:24.998 --> 01:28.597
Hardly. T-pexed all over
with that awful morbid rubbish.

01:28.730 --> 01:30.465
It's not rubbish!
It's Metallica.

01:30.597 --> 01:32.065
It's not appropriate
for a wedding.

01:32.198 --> 01:34.132
It's poetry.
People read poems at weddings.

01:34.265 --> 01:36.298
Why don't I get some
new trainers, then?

01:36.432 --> 01:38.298
You are wearing proper shoes
to this wedding.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.132
A wedding of two people
I've never even met.

01:40.265 --> 01:42.065
You have met them, actually,
Daniel, when you were two,

01:42.198 --> 01:44.132
Judith saved you
from choking on a grape.

01:44.265 --> 01:45.597
I don't remember.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.931
It was rather
frightening, actually.

01:48.065 --> 01:51.298
Your face went blue and your
eyes sort of bugged out.

01:51.432 --> 01:53.830
- Have that, then.
- Nope.

02:02.864 --> 02:06.764
- Is it nice?
- Mmm!

02:06.897 --> 02:09.597
- Could I have a little corner?
- Every time!

02:09.663 --> 02:10.830
Why don't you get
your own one?

02:10.965 --> 02:13.697
Just a tiny bit
off the end, there?

02:13.830 --> 02:14.965
- No icing.
- Okay.

02:21.597 --> 02:22.198
Mmm!

02:26.597 --> 02:27.931
So six weeks in Florida,

02:28.065 --> 02:29.663
what you most
looking forward to?

02:29.797 --> 02:31.864
What if the baby's born
whilst I'm there?

02:31.998 --> 02:33.663
How you feel about
becoming a big brother?

02:33.797 --> 02:35.864
Half-brother.

02:35.998 --> 02:38.065
If I'm his half brother,
then what does that make you?

02:38.198 --> 02:39.697
Well, nothing, really.

02:39.830 --> 02:42.931
Half... step-mum.

02:43.065 --> 02:44.965
No, no, I'm just the baby's
father's ex-wife,

02:45.098 --> 02:49.332
I've nothing to do with it...
him or her, I should say.

02:49.465 --> 02:50.931
You were desperate
for a little brother or sister

02:51.065 --> 02:53.898
- when you were younger.
- So?

02:54.032 --> 02:56.730
I thought you would be
more excited.

02:56.865 --> 02:57.898
They'll probably name it
something stupid

02:58.032 --> 03:01.032
and American, like...
Brooke.

03:01.165 --> 03:03.032
Daniel,
that's not very nice.

03:03.165 --> 03:04.465
Or Brie.

03:04.597 --> 03:07.198
Candy.

03:07.332 --> 03:11.730
Yeah.

03:11.865 --> 03:13.730
Guess what the temperature
is in Florida.

03:13.865 --> 03:16.663
- Ooh, high, I bet, is it?
- I said guess.

03:16.797 --> 03:22.232
- Well, it'd be hot... 31, 32?
- 30.

03:22.365 --> 03:24.931
Hmm, still, that's warm.

03:25.065 --> 03:26.730
Are you sure you have enough
summer clothes?

03:26.865 --> 03:27.898
You'll bake in black,
you know?

03:28.032 --> 03:31.697
They got air conditioning.

03:31.831 --> 03:33.298
Can I do the gears?

03:33.432 --> 03:35.365
- No.
- Why not?

03:35.498 --> 03:37.464
Because you can't drive.

03:37.597 --> 03:40.630
- Ky's mum lets him.
- Hmm.

03:40.764 --> 03:42.498
You're always telling me to
try new things.

03:42.630 --> 03:44.198
You know that's not
what I mean.

03:44.332 --> 03:46.998
- What do you mean, then?
- Oh, I don't know, Daniel.

03:47.132 --> 03:49.198
Olives?

03:49.332 --> 03:51.965
Dad's going to let me drive
his convertible MG in Florida.

03:52.098 --> 03:56.298
Well, you're not driving
the Vauxhall Astra here.

04:00.298 --> 04:02.132
Hello, Riley!

04:03.630 --> 04:05.198
Daniel, could you get that?

04:14.298 --> 04:18.498
Hello? Hello?

04:18.630 --> 04:22.165
I think they've hung u...
oh, hello, Bernie.

04:22.298 --> 04:24.865
Fine, yes, thank you and...

04:24.998 --> 04:27.065
Yes.

04:27.198 --> 04:27.798
Oh.

04:31.865 --> 04:35.898
No, you have to do
what you feel is...

04:36.032 --> 04:39.965
Um, actually,
it's best if I do.

04:40.098 --> 04:41.965
Daniel.

04:42.098 --> 04:45.597
Sorry, it's just he doesn't
really like Danny.

04:45.663 --> 04:47.332
I will.

04:47.464 --> 04:49.198
Okay.

04:49.332 --> 04:51.298
You too, bye now.

05:00.597 --> 05:02.597
What does she want?

05:02.731 --> 05:04.398
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- No.

05:04.597 --> 05:07.065
What did she say?

05:07.198 --> 05:13.998
Um, your dad and Bernie,
well... there... it's a...

05:14.132 --> 05:17.032
it's a bit tricky, but...
with the baby due so soon

05:17.165 --> 05:19.265
they're feeling
a little overwhelmed.

05:19.398 --> 05:21.597
- They don't want me to come.
- No, it isn't that they don't

05:21.663 --> 05:25.597
want you, it's...
bad timing.

05:25.731 --> 05:26.965
They're gonna re-arrange
in a few months

05:27.098 --> 05:30.498
and that way you can
meet the new arrival.

05:30.630 --> 05:33.265
So I'm afraid you're stuck with
boring old me for six weeks,

05:33.398 --> 05:36.931
but we'll have fun.

05:37.065 --> 05:40.098
I'm sorry, love, I know how
disappointed you must be.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.098
Get a load
of these puppies...

07:47.231 --> 07:49.464
this, my friend, is what happens
when man becomes machine.

07:49.598 --> 07:51.065
Since when
do you lift weights?

07:51.198 --> 07:52.898
Since I've been getting
a date tonight.

07:53.032 --> 07:54.664
And you're go ice skating
with your cousin.

07:54.798 --> 07:56.464
Yeah, but she's bringing
her fit friend.

07:56.598 --> 07:58.765
So it's not a date.

07:58.898 --> 08:00.631
I think this calls
for the hat.

08:03.865 --> 08:05.965
You might want to put
a top on first.

08:06.098 --> 08:09.364
- What's Skull Slayer?
- It's the name of my band.

08:09.498 --> 08:11.631
- But you don't have a band.
- I know, but when I do...

08:11.765 --> 08:13.398
Well, how is that
going to work?

08:13.598 --> 08:15.965
- Do you play an instrument?
- I'm gonna be the front man.

08:16.098 --> 08:19.765
Well, that sounds
extremely plausible.

08:19.898 --> 08:21.664
Is Daniel ready?

08:21.798 --> 08:25.398
Sorry to hear about
his Florida trip... oh!

08:25.598 --> 08:27.798
You must've been looking
forward to a bit of you time.

08:27.931 --> 08:30.065
Well, these things happen.

08:30.197 --> 08:33.597
Hmm. Hope you didn't have to
cancel any nice plans.

08:33.698 --> 08:36.498
My only plan was to clear out
the loft... a bit sad, isn't it?

08:36.631 --> 08:40.597
Oh, no, a clear-out can be
fantastically therapeutic...

08:40.664 --> 08:43.164
clear loft, clear head.

08:43.297 --> 08:47.364
Daniel seems quite philosophical
about it all, though.

08:47.499 --> 08:50.865
Does he? I think he's quite
disappointed, to be honest.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.065
Daniel!

08:53.197 --> 08:56.931
He said he does understand his
dad and step-mum's situation...

08:57.065 --> 08:58.731
we had a good chat
about it at lunch.

08:58.865 --> 09:01.164
He's very mature for his age.

09:01.297 --> 09:03.765
Gosh, that's very...

09:03.898 --> 09:06.664
Well, what a nice thing
to hear.

09:06.798 --> 09:08.631
Don't you think so?

09:08.765 --> 09:11.798
Yeah, I mean,
of course his...

09:11.931 --> 09:14.065
yeah, it's different when
they're yours, isn't it?

09:14.197 --> 09:16.297
You see all the bad moods as
well as...

09:16.431 --> 09:18.698
Daniel, love!

09:18.831 --> 09:20.631
I'm coming!

09:24.197 --> 09:29.164
Isn't all that energy
just so... terrific?

10:07.631 --> 10:10.231
Hi, boy.

10:18.297 --> 10:20.998
Don't tell me you ain't
got dressed all day?

10:21.131 --> 10:22.398
I didn't have
any clean clothes.

10:22.531 --> 10:23.865
Or taken Riley for a walk.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.097
I was going to,
after lunch.

10:26.231 --> 10:27.664
It's five o'clock!
And what are you eating?

10:27.798 --> 10:29.465
Is that ketchup?

10:29.598 --> 10:31.564
Yeah, we've run out of
everything else.

10:31.698 --> 10:34.432
Will it kill ya
to go to the shops?

10:34.564 --> 10:36.064
I don't have
any money, do I?

10:36.197 --> 10:37.898
No clean clothes,
no food, no money,

10:38.032 --> 10:41.998
- oh, but plenty of excuses.
- Just the facts.

10:42.131 --> 10:45.097
Since you're so keen on facts,
here are a few for you.

10:45.231 --> 10:47.399
I've been at work all day,
I come home to find you

10:47.531 --> 10:50.064
still in your pajamas, the poor
dog scratching at the door,

10:50.197 --> 10:51.765
and instead of saying,
"Hello, mum, how was your day,

10:51.898 --> 10:53.399
would you like a cup of tea?"

10:53.531 --> 10:55.264
you blame me for the fact
you're too bloomin' lazy

10:55.399 --> 10:57.664
to do a single thing
for yourself.

10:57.798 --> 10:59.598
Have you finished nagging,
mother?

10:59.731 --> 11:01.399
Do not talk to me
like that.

11:01.598 --> 11:04.097
Then don't be a bitch!

11:04.231 --> 11:06.865
I don't want to be here, do I?
I want to be in Florida,

11:06.998 --> 11:10.264
where I'm supposed
to be, with dad!

11:30.865 --> 11:32.798
Morning!

11:32.931 --> 11:34.631
I've had a wonderful idea.

11:34.765 --> 11:35.831
You're going to look for a
summer job.

11:35.965 --> 11:37.097
Oh.

11:37.231 --> 11:38.898
This morning
you can work on your CV

11:39.031 --> 11:40.765
and hand it out
this afternoon.

11:40.898 --> 11:42.598
- Okay.
- I don't want any arguments,

11:42.731 --> 11:44.031
I want you to get on
and do it, please.

11:44.164 --> 11:46.664
I said okay.

11:46.798 --> 11:50.664
Oh. Good.

11:50.798 --> 11:52.898
Have a nice day, love.

12:07.731 --> 12:10.664
- Mr. Porter, isn't it?
- Uh...

12:10.798 --> 12:12.465
We met at Daniel's
parency thing.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.365
Yes, of course.

12:14.499 --> 12:18.197
Bagnold, Daniel Bagnold,
is my son... 10J.

12:18.332 --> 12:22.898
Very nice to see you again...
Daniel Bagnold's mum.

12:23.031 --> 12:26.298
Sue. It always does
that silly thing.

12:26.432 --> 12:28.332
Maybe I ought to put it on
back to front to start with,

12:28.465 --> 12:31.865
then it might turn itself
the right way around.

12:31.997 --> 12:35.131
So, Sue, is Daniel enjoying
his summer holidays?

12:35.264 --> 12:38.064
Not really. He was meant to be
visiting his father in Florida,

12:38.197 --> 12:40.598
but let's just say Bob
isn't the most reliable.

12:40.731 --> 12:42.831
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

12:42.964 --> 12:44.865
It's pretty tough
on Daniel.

12:44.997 --> 12:47.231
Well, it's not easy on you
either, I'd imagine.

12:47.365 --> 12:50.631
Oh, well, we muddle through.

12:50.765 --> 12:53.765
Oh, American history,
is that your specialty?

12:53.898 --> 12:57.765
Oh, no, I'm cramming,
actually.

12:57.897 --> 12:59.964
Just been lumped with
a new A-level syllabus...

13:00.097 --> 13:02.097
some of this stuff I haven't
done since my student days.

13:02.231 --> 13:04.598
I'm a World War II man,
truth be told.

13:04.731 --> 13:07.031
Five weeks to cover 400 years,

13:07.164 --> 13:08.465
what do you reckon,
sound doable?

13:08.598 --> 13:10.664
With time to spare, I'd say.

13:10.798 --> 13:15.232
Ah, I like your spirit,
Sue Bagnold.

13:15.365 --> 13:17.131
Just these three
you wanted to borrow?

13:18.698 --> 13:20.897
As it happens,
I'd rather like

13:21.031 --> 13:24.097
to borrow you
for an evening, too.

13:24.232 --> 13:26.298
Presume there's a slightly
different system for that.

13:26.432 --> 13:29.964
Me? Uh, uh, that's very...
gosh, uh...

13:30.097 --> 13:32.465
Well, where do these blessed
things go?

13:32.631 --> 13:36.031
Dinner? Glass of wine,
maybe two?

13:36.164 --> 13:39.598
That would be...
yeah, very nice.

13:39.731 --> 13:42.298
There we go.

13:42.432 --> 13:44.831
Due back on the 19th.

13:44.964 --> 13:46.399
There you are, Mr. Porter.

13:46.598 --> 13:48.997
Call me Douglas, please.

13:49.131 --> 13:52.930
- Douglas.
- And call me, please.

13:54.765 --> 13:58.198
- My number.
- Thank you.

13:58.332 --> 14:01.499
But first, I have a date
with the founding fathers.

14:01.631 --> 14:03.031
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

14:53.797 --> 14:55.664
Anything else?

14:55.797 --> 14:58.097
Uh, cheeseburger,
fries and a coke.

14:58.232 --> 15:01.031
- Wanna go large for 60p?
- Uh, yeah, all right.

15:30.098 --> 15:33.031
- Any luck today, love?
- No.

15:33.165 --> 15:35.731
- Where did you ask?
- Everywhere.

15:35.864 --> 15:38.465
- Did you have a news agent?
- I searched everywhere.

15:38.598 --> 15:43.132
- Were you wearing that t-shirt?
- Why?

15:43.265 --> 15:46.664
Uh, perhaps it doesn't make
a great first impression.

15:46.797 --> 15:48.698
You told me to show my CV
and I did.

15:48.830 --> 15:50.132
You told me to hand it
around town, and I did.

15:50.265 --> 15:52.198
Why are you still
having a go at me?

15:52.332 --> 15:53.797
I'm not having a go, I'm just
wondering whether you might have

15:53.930 --> 15:55.598
a better chance
if you wore something

15:55.730 --> 15:59.399
- that isn't quite so gruesome.
- That's discrimination.

15:59.598 --> 16:02.797
It isn't discrimination,
Daniel, it's just common sense.

16:02.930 --> 16:05.065
If someone comes into your shop
wearing a t-shirt with a man

16:05.198 --> 16:07.132
being electrocuted on it,
he might wonder whether...

16:07.265 --> 16:09.332
It's discrimination to judge
someone based on their beliefs.

16:09.465 --> 16:11.664
Music is my religion.

16:11.797 --> 16:13.598
You're being facetious...
I'm trying to help.

16:13.730 --> 16:15.598
You're saying
I looked gruesome.

16:15.664 --> 16:20.132
I didn't say you looked
gruesome, I said your t-shirt.

16:20.265 --> 16:21.764
You know what,
I'm too tired for this.

16:21.897 --> 16:23.499
- Go to bed, then.
- I will...

16:23.631 --> 16:24.864
- pizza is in the freezer.
- I'm not hungry.

16:24.997 --> 16:28.332
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

17:25.896 --> 17:27.896
So, nothing happened
with this girl, then.

17:28.031 --> 17:29.964
- She was into me.
- Was she, though?

17:30.098 --> 17:32.265
She's only human, isn't she?

17:32.399 --> 17:35.232
You're such a bullshitter, I
bet you didn't even talk to her.

17:35.365 --> 17:37.797
I was going to say, I saw her
at this new band Skull Slayer,

17:37.930 --> 17:39.764
- going to be the front man?
- Fuck off, no you didn't.

17:39.897 --> 17:42.265
Yeah, you just can't wait
to see me in action.

17:42.399 --> 17:43.697
The joke's on you because
I just might be joining a band.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.598
Sure, sure.

17:49.132 --> 17:51.830
- Who, then?
- You don't know them.

17:51.965 --> 17:53.797
- Do they go to our school?
- I said you didn't know them.

17:53.930 --> 17:55.897
'Cause that doesn't make
sense.

17:56.032 --> 17:57.797
Well, I guess you're just
going to have to wait and see.

18:00.298 --> 18:02.298
I can handle the noise,
just about.

18:02.432 --> 18:04.032
It's the wolf-whistles

18:04.165 --> 18:07.298
every time I leave the house
I can't stand.

18:07.432 --> 18:09.697
I hope they don't bother you.

18:09.830 --> 18:12.198
I don't think anyone's ever
wolf-whistled at me.

18:12.332 --> 18:13.998
I should probably take it as
a bit of a compliment.

18:14.132 --> 18:17.265
Oh.

18:17.399 --> 18:21.032
Has anyone ever told you what
pretty eyes you have?

18:21.165 --> 18:24.730
Would you mind?

18:24.864 --> 18:28.165
Oh, my goodness.
Look at you!

18:28.298 --> 18:33.098
- May I?
- They're probably quite strong.

18:33.232 --> 18:35.697
I don't think I've got quite
the right head shape for these.

18:35.830 --> 18:37.730
- No?
- Too angular.

18:37.864 --> 18:40.830
Not lovely and round
like yours.

18:40.965 --> 18:45.132
But seriously, Sue,
do you ever wear contacts?

18:45.265 --> 18:48.864
Such a shame to hide
those beauties away.

18:48.998 --> 18:52.132
I like your bangle,
is it bamboo?

18:52.265 --> 18:54.365
Isn't it fab?

18:54.597 --> 18:56.764
It's actually Nepalese teak.

19:46.065 --> 19:49.498
Hello.

19:49.630 --> 19:51.399
Yes, hello, hi,
is that Mr. Douglas?

19:51.597 --> 19:53.232
Speaking.

19:53.365 --> 19:54.998
It's Sue, we met
the other day at the...

19:55.132 --> 19:58.232
Sorry, hello?

19:58.365 --> 20:00.931
Daniel? Hang on, I think
Daniel's trying to...

20:01.065 --> 20:04.498
Ah, Sue, Sue Bagnold, Daniel
in 10J's lovely mum.

20:04.630 --> 20:06.831
Mr. Porter?

20:06.965 --> 20:11.865
Daniel,
I'm on the phone, love.

20:11.998 --> 20:15.464
I'm so sorry, Mister... Douglas,
can I call you back?

20:15.597 --> 20:18.663
- Sure, speak soon.
- Bye.

20:25.663 --> 20:27.831
I'm putting the kettle on,
would you like a cup of tea?

20:27.965 --> 20:29.498
Why were you on the phone
to my history teacher?

20:29.630 --> 20:30.365
Douglas came
into the library...

20:30.498 --> 20:32.399
Douglas?

20:32.530 --> 20:35.630
You didn't really think
his first name was "Mister".

20:35.764 --> 20:37.764
Anyway, we got
chatting and thought

20:37.898 --> 20:40.432
- it might be nice to meet up.
- What, like a date?

20:40.563 --> 20:43.431
- Well, dinner.
- Ugh.

20:43.563 --> 20:45.065
Is it so hard to believe

20:45.198 --> 20:46.663
someone might want to go
on a date with me?

20:46.798 --> 20:49.898
- Yes.
- Well, thanks very much.

20:50.032 --> 20:52.730
Daniel, this is really
not a big deal.

20:52.865 --> 20:54.965
We just had a bit
of a flirt, I suppose.

20:55.098 --> 20:57.764
Oh! Please stop talking now.

20:57.898 --> 20:59.198
If it makes you feel
uncomfortable...

20:59.332 --> 21:01.765
- It does.
- Then we can talk about it.

21:01.898 --> 21:03.697
Talking about it makes me
uncomfortable!

21:03.831 --> 21:08.165
Okay, okay, I'll leave it
for the moment.

21:08.298 --> 21:10.198
But when you're ready
you know where I am.

21:10.332 --> 21:13.032
- I'll never be ready.
- Anyway, you can phone Ky now.

21:13.165 --> 21:16.597
I wasn't phoning Ky... why do
you assume I only phone Ky?

21:16.697 --> 21:18.663
- Sorry, who were you phoning?
- No one.

21:18.798 --> 21:21.597
- A girl?
- No!

21:21.730 --> 21:25.132
- A new friend?
- Ah, none of your business!

21:25.265 --> 21:27.132
Okay.

21:27.265 --> 21:29.697
Can you get out of
my room, please?

21:39.831 --> 21:44.965
Daniel! Auntie Carol
and Katie are here.

21:45.098 --> 21:46.965
Can I get you a drink, Katie?

21:47.098 --> 21:50.498
- Coke? Orange squash?
- Oh, I'd love a coffee.

21:50.630 --> 21:53.731
Oh, hang on, I'm sure
I have some somewhere.

21:53.865 --> 21:55.765
Sue's more of a tea lady.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.332
Oh, I mean, if it's any
trouble...

21:57.464 --> 21:58.931
No, not at all.

21:59.065 --> 22:02.232
Oh, here we are,
"Best before 2012,"

22:02.364 --> 22:05.663
- do you think it's still okay?
- Oh, not sure.

22:05.798 --> 22:08.597
I'll just have a tea, then,
thanks, Sue.

22:08.698 --> 22:10.698
Do you have any almond milk?

22:10.831 --> 22:15.597
- Almond milk?
- Black's fine.

22:15.731 --> 22:18.065
- Hey.
- All right.

22:22.931 --> 22:25.132
Have you got a girlfriend?

22:25.265 --> 22:27.831
No.

22:27.965 --> 22:31.731
I'm seeing someone... Ryan.

22:31.865 --> 22:34.898
Don't tell mum, though,
he's 19.

22:35.032 --> 22:38.698
- Really.
- He thinks I'm 18.

22:38.831 --> 22:40.831
He has, like, three cars.

22:40.965 --> 22:42.597
Right.

22:42.664 --> 22:45.265
A state agent.

22:45.398 --> 22:49.331
D'you want to see a picture?

22:49.464 --> 22:52.098
- What do you think?
- He's not really my type.

22:55.998 --> 22:59.065
That was actually
quite funny.

22:59.198 --> 23:00.765
Seriously, Dan, like,
don't tell your mum

23:00.898 --> 23:02.698
because I don't want it
getting back to my mum.

23:02.831 --> 23:04.931
No, I won't.

23:09.731 --> 23:11.698
He spends so much time
on his own.

23:11.831 --> 23:15.132
You weren't exactly
life and soul at his age.

23:15.265 --> 23:17.664
- Oi.
- Or, dare I say it, now.

23:17.798 --> 23:20.464
That's not fair,
I can be... fun.

23:20.597 --> 23:22.965
Go on, then, when was the last
time you had a night out?

23:23.098 --> 23:24.865
I had a drink with
the staff from work

23:24.998 --> 23:26.765
at the White Horse...
two drinks.

23:26.898 --> 23:29.464
- When?
- Well, March.

23:29.597 --> 23:31.765
Exactly.

23:31.898 --> 23:33.998
Daniel will grow into himself.

23:34.132 --> 23:38.264
He's a bit quiet, but he's not,
you know, strange, like...

23:38.398 --> 23:41.898
like that weirdo from the boys
combo who was keen on you,

23:42.032 --> 23:44.065
- what was his name?
- No, there was no one...

23:44.198 --> 23:46.664
Yes! Always hanging around
you, you know who I mean,

23:46.798 --> 23:51.065
with a plastic bag and a wispy
sort of moustache.

23:51.198 --> 23:53.598
Ian.

23:53.698 --> 23:56.765
Ian! Ian. God, that was it.

23:56.898 --> 23:59.065
Ian was someone
you'd worry about.

24:02.631 --> 24:06.631
Hey, do you smoke weed?

24:06.765 --> 24:09.098
Um, not really.

24:09.231 --> 24:12.865
'Cause I reckon I can
sort you out if you want it.

24:12.998 --> 24:15.631
I'm probably
all right, thanks.

24:15.765 --> 24:18.731
All the goths
in my year smoke weed.

24:18.865 --> 24:22.931
- I'm not a goth.
- Oh... kay.

24:26.598 --> 24:31.631
- What are you, then?
- Dunno.

24:31.765 --> 24:33.664
Not too short on the fringe,

24:33.798 --> 24:35.965
I don't want it to look like
I've had it done.

24:36.098 --> 24:37.931
You know who you sound
just like?

24:38.065 --> 24:41.731
Who?
Oh, no, don't!

24:41.865 --> 24:43.598
She didn't like
going out either.

24:43.698 --> 24:45.865
It's clearly a hermit streak
in our family.

24:45.998 --> 24:48.598
I'm not a hermit, I have
a job and a son and an ex

24:48.731 --> 24:50.698
whose last three
child support checks

24:50.831 --> 24:52.731
have been mysteriously
lost in the post.

24:52.865 --> 24:55.098
Did I tell you he's got
himself an MG?

24:55.231 --> 24:58.731
- Well, bulb!
- Convertible! Flash so-and-so.

24:58.865 --> 25:01.598
- Flash bastard.
- Carol.

25:01.664 --> 25:06.297
When Daniel told me I was
quite... ticked off, actually.

25:06.431 --> 25:09.132
- It is uncanny.
- What?

25:09.264 --> 25:13.598
You're mum... Mach Two,
right down to the glasses.

25:13.731 --> 25:16.065
Marvelous!
Just what I need.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.065
<i>Douglas Porter's out and about.</i>

26:39.197 --> 26:40.965
<i>Leave a message after the...</i>

26:41.097 --> 26:44.197
Douglas, hello, it's
Sue Bagnold from the library.

26:44.331 --> 26:46.231
I hope you're very well.

26:46.364 --> 26:49.798
By my calculations you'll be
into the American Civil War

26:49.931 --> 26:53.197
by now... awful,
bloody business, isn't it?

26:53.331 --> 26:57.698
Just wondered if you did
fancy dinner or a drink?

26:57.831 --> 26:59.998
Friday night?

27:00.131 --> 27:02.598
Give me a ring back
whenever, no rush.

27:02.731 --> 27:03.264
822-496. Bye, now.

27:14.598 --> 27:16.698
Oh, shit!

27:18.965 --> 27:20.598
<i>Douglas Porter's out and about.</i>

27:20.664 --> 27:22.399
<i>Leave a message after the....</i>

27:22.598 --> 27:24.465
Um, yeah, hello,
just realized,

27:24.598 --> 27:25.998
as I'm sure
you will have, too,

27:26.131 --> 27:28.432
that I read your number
back to you

27:28.598 --> 27:32.131
instead of leaving mine...
stupid.

27:32.264 --> 27:38.598
So, I'm on 823-771...

27:38.664 --> 27:43.231
Sue... Bagnold, that is.

27:43.365 --> 27:48.297
Again. Sorry. Okay... bye!

28:05.399 --> 28:07.898
Hello?

28:08.031 --> 28:10.664
Oh, Bob, yes, he's here.
Just before I hand you over,

28:10.798 --> 28:12.598
did you get a chance
to re-post that check

28:12.731 --> 28:15.631
because I still
haven't seen...

28:15.765 --> 28:20.465
Oh! Okay.

28:20.598 --> 28:25.231
Hang on.
It's your dad.

28:25.365 --> 28:27.997
Hey, dad,
did you get my email?

28:28.131 --> 28:32.365
I sent you some songs
I found...

28:32.499 --> 28:34.831
Well, half-sister.

28:45.664 --> 28:48.831
I'm fine, bye.

28:53.064 --> 28:56.631
- Well?
- It's a girl.

28:56.765 --> 29:00.097
Well, that's sooner than
expected, but...

29:00.231 --> 29:03.898
Everything's okay?
Is there a name?

29:04.031 --> 29:06.964
- He didn't say.
- Well, what did he say?

29:07.097 --> 29:10.798
- Kept calling me "Danny".
- Well, he's just excited, love.

29:10.930 --> 29:12.964
- I remember when you were born...
- I'm going out.

29:18.964 --> 29:19.997
Shame it didn't work out

29:20.131 --> 29:21.831
with your little
make-believe band.

29:21.964 --> 29:24.265
Who says it didn't?

29:24.399 --> 29:28.164
Don't tell me you're still
clinging onto that delusion.

29:28.298 --> 29:30.164
Guess who my mum's
going on a date with.

29:30.298 --> 29:31.865
Oh, oh, she's seeing
someone else, is she?

29:31.997 --> 29:32.997
Oh, the cable wasn't
enough for her?

29:33.131 --> 29:34.898
Ha-ha.

29:35.031 --> 29:37.997
Mr. Porter,
she calls him "Douglas".

29:38.131 --> 29:40.097
Eh, if I was
an older single lady

29:40.231 --> 29:41.997
I'd probably go for
someone like him.

29:42.131 --> 29:44.064
What are you talking about?

29:44.197 --> 29:45.664
Well, he's in pretty good
shape for a man of his vintage...

29:45.798 --> 29:48.298
and he reads,
which is important for a lady

29:48.432 --> 29:50.930
of letters like Mrs. B.

29:51.064 --> 29:54.332
What happens
if he was my step-dad?

29:54.465 --> 29:56.698
He could give you the answers
to your history tests.

29:56.831 --> 30:01.598
- He'd have to so you'd like him.
- I don't know.

30:17.598 --> 30:19.365
Oh, where have you been?
I was beginning to worry.

30:19.499 --> 30:21.798
Oh, uh, Ky's.

30:21.930 --> 30:25.798
- Why aren't you asleep?
- It's only ten.

30:25.930 --> 30:29.831
Oh, I thought it was,
like, midnight.

30:29.964 --> 30:31.564
Did you have a nice evening?

30:31.698 --> 30:36.664
Yeah, it was great,
thanks, mum. Mum...

30:36.798 --> 30:39.064
How's it going, mum?

30:39.198 --> 30:42.465
Fine, thank you, Daniel,
did you have something to eat?

30:42.598 --> 30:44.864
- No.
- Would you like a sandwich?

30:44.997 --> 30:48.131
Yeah.

30:48.265 --> 30:53.499
- Cheese?
- Yeah, I love cheese.

30:53.631 --> 30:56.131
So, what did you and Ky
get up to this evening, then?

30:56.265 --> 31:00.964
Just the normal stuff.
Pool, X-box.

31:01.097 --> 31:03.198
All right,
so who won pool?

31:03.332 --> 31:06.830
I'm just going to go
to my room.

31:06.964 --> 31:07.964
Don't you want
your sandwich?

31:08.097 --> 31:11.598
I'm feeling a little bit...

31:15.798 --> 31:19.765
At least get your hair
out the way.

31:19.897 --> 31:22.064
Must've been something I ate.

31:22.198 --> 31:24.031
Hmm.

31:24.165 --> 31:26.332
I feel horrible.

31:26.465 --> 31:29.198
You'll be all right, love.

31:50.232 --> 31:53.631
What people don't realize is,

31:53.764 --> 31:56.031
you spend far
more time marking

31:56.165 --> 31:57.930
and doing paperwork
than you do in the classroom

31:58.064 --> 32:00.864
- and actually teaching.
- Yes, quite.

32:00.997 --> 32:04.731
We get all these young grads
arrive every September,

32:04.864 --> 32:07.997
all misty-eyed, dead set
on being the inspiring teacher

32:08.132 --> 32:10.797
that the kids will remember
forever and I...

32:10.930 --> 32:13.031
I say to myself, you wait.

32:13.165 --> 32:16.365
You'll be zombies like
the rest of us before Christmas.

32:16.499 --> 32:18.764
- The optimism of youth.
- Hmm.

32:18.897 --> 32:21.499
I imagine
it's the same for you.

32:21.631 --> 32:25.730
People picture you whiling away
your days in the book stacks,

32:25.864 --> 32:28.198
but the reality is targets,

32:28.332 --> 32:31.098
box ticking and funding
applications.

32:31.232 --> 32:34.864
Don't forget fixing
photocopier jams.

32:34.997 --> 32:37.730
But no, there's good bits, too,
there's the reading groups...

32:37.864 --> 32:40.897
You have to try this.

32:41.031 --> 32:44.598
Oh, um...
okay, thank you.

32:48.930 --> 32:49.864
Yeah?

32:49.997 --> 32:53.664
- Yeah. Mm.
- Yeah? Mm.

32:53.797 --> 32:55.298
- That's good.
- Yeah.

33:00.764 --> 33:02.930
- How's yours?
- Lovely, thank you.

33:06.499 --> 33:11.098
- Would you like to try some?
- Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

33:20.198 --> 33:22.399
Mmm...

33:22.598 --> 33:23.165
Mm-mm-mm. Mmm.

33:28.797 --> 33:31.065
I think I made
the right decision.

33:53.265 --> 33:54.964
Oh, what the hell.

34:03.465 --> 34:06.598
I've taken the liberty
of ordering some more wine.

34:06.697 --> 34:09.098
Mr. Porter, I'll be drunk.

34:09.232 --> 34:13.364
Nonsense, ladies do not
get drunk, merely tiddly.

34:13.498 --> 34:16.331
Well, cheers.

34:16.465 --> 34:19.165
Cheers to you,
Sue Bagnold.

34:21.331 --> 34:24.897
Mmm...

34:25.032 --> 34:27.197
When you were in the ladies,

34:27.331 --> 34:31.098
I remembered I knew
a Bagnold at university.

34:31.232 --> 34:35.399
But I can't for the life of me
think of his first name.

34:35.598 --> 34:37.498
Paul? Robert?

34:37.630 --> 34:39.864
My ex-husband
was Robert... Bob.

34:39.998 --> 34:41.965
Where were you at university?

34:42.098 --> 34:43.663
- Oxford?
- Ah, then no,

34:43.797 --> 34:45.998
Bob and I were at Hull.

34:46.132 --> 34:47.663
It would've been odd,
wouldn't it,

34:47.797 --> 34:51.165
if we'd known each other,
way back when?

34:51.297 --> 34:54.764
And come together again
all these years later.

34:54.897 --> 34:56.931
The path not taken.

34:57.065 --> 34:59.998
Well, there are many
paths not taken.

35:00.132 --> 35:03.332
Oh, a bit of a one, were you,
in your heyday?

35:03.465 --> 35:06.098
Goodness me, no, I didn't mean
it like that, just that...

35:06.232 --> 35:08.432
I don't know, sometimes
it seems so arbitrary,

35:08.597 --> 35:10.965
the way things pan out.

35:11.098 --> 35:13.697
To think Bob's now in Florida
with a 36-year-old wife

35:13.830 --> 35:15.630
and a new baby daughter,

35:15.764 --> 35:18.132
driving a convertible bloody MG,
while here I am...

35:18.265 --> 35:22.998
Richard... Dicky Bagnold, Dicky
Dicky Bagnold... natural science,

35:23.132 --> 35:25.730
he was a big fellow, played
a lot of rugby, as I recall.

35:25.864 --> 35:28.165
I doubt he was any relation.

35:28.298 --> 35:31.864
Bob comes from rather
weedy stock.

35:31.998 --> 35:37.265
Did you ever think of going
back to your maiden name?

35:37.399 --> 35:41.898
Bagnold, believe it or not,
is an improvement.

35:42.032 --> 35:45.298
Really?

35:45.432 --> 35:47.830
Well, then, I simply
must know what it was.

35:52.797 --> 35:55.998
- Sneed.
- Ooh.

36:07.865 --> 36:12.132
Well, thank you for such
a lovely evening, Douglas.

36:38.165 --> 36:40.797
I really...

36:40.931 --> 36:44.132
I really should be
getting in.

36:44.265 --> 36:46.597
Perhaps I should join you
for a nightcap.

36:46.663 --> 36:49.697
I rea...

36:49.831 --> 36:54.931
I think with Daniel here
you best not... this time.

36:55.065 --> 36:56.597
Can't blame a boy
for trying.

37:20.697 --> 37:23.232
Hello, love, I'm home!

37:27.165 --> 37:27.730
Daniel...

37:49.132 --> 37:51.597
You had an early night
last night.

37:51.663 --> 37:54.597
Yep.

37:54.697 --> 37:56.998
Thought you'd be up
when I got in.

37:57.132 --> 37:58.663
Tired.

38:07.098 --> 38:08.132
Do you want to know
how my evening was?

38:08.265 --> 38:10.332
Nope.

38:10.464 --> 38:11.597
I'm gone for five minutes

38:11.697 --> 38:12.730
and I get back
and my big sister's

38:12.865 --> 38:14.765
turned into a sex maniac.

38:14.898 --> 38:18.365
- Oh, shush.
- Tell me everything.

38:18.498 --> 38:20.597
Well, there isn't much
to tell.

38:20.663 --> 38:23.798
- We had dinner, some wine.
- And? Did you?

38:23.931 --> 38:25.998
- Carol!
- You had a date

38:26.132 --> 38:27.697
with a randy single man
in his 50s,

38:27.831 --> 38:30.498
- what else am I gonna ask?
- Who says he's randy?

38:30.630 --> 38:33.198
Asking out
the librarian, come on.

38:33.332 --> 38:36.931
What? So you're saying he'd...
you know, anything that moves.

38:37.065 --> 38:39.697
No, but you don't exactly
scream "ask me out".

38:39.831 --> 38:42.765
- Well, thanks very much.
- Oh, don't get huffy.

38:42.898 --> 38:44.731
He must've been on
the lookout for opportunities,

38:44.865 --> 38:47.265
is all I'm saying...
come on, spill.

38:47.398 --> 38:51.498
Well... we had a bit of
a cuddle in the taxi.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.765
- A cuddle?
- Embrace, a kiss, a...

38:53.898 --> 38:57.798
- I don't know.
- In the taxi?

38:57.931 --> 39:01.597
I drank too wine
and he's very charming.

39:01.663 --> 39:03.731
- Good kisser?
- How would I know?

39:03.865 --> 39:05.931
I haven't kissed anyone
since Bob.

39:06.065 --> 39:08.065
- And will you see him again?
- Well, I don't see why not,

39:08.198 --> 39:10.597
he seemed keen... lord knows why,
I'm just the dreary,

39:10.663 --> 39:12.765
old librarian.

39:12.898 --> 39:14.431
Oh, you know I didn't
mean it like that.

39:14.597 --> 39:15.898
You did a bit, be honest.

39:16.032 --> 39:17.998
Who cares?
You have a boyfriend!

39:18.132 --> 39:20.498
At 52.

39:20.630 --> 39:23.165
I don't think Daniel's too happy
about me seeing his teacher.

39:23.298 --> 39:24.798
You've been living like
a nun for eight years,

39:24.931 --> 39:26.630
you're allowed
to have a bit of fun.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.664
It's not like we're even
anything yet, but...

39:28.798 --> 39:30.265
I'm going to give you
highlights

39:30.398 --> 39:32.265
before your next date.

39:32.398 --> 39:35.165
No, wait, I'm going to give
you extensions... blond ones.

39:35.298 --> 39:37.597
You bloody aren't!

39:47.265 --> 39:49.965
Mom!

39:50.098 --> 39:52.597
Up here!

39:55.398 --> 39:57.798
Riley's been sick.

39:57.931 --> 40:00.464
- Well, could you clear it up?
- In my shoe.

40:00.597 --> 40:02.965
- Oh, dear.
- It stinks.

40:03.098 --> 40:04.297
Yes, okay, leave it
by the washing machine

40:04.431 --> 40:06.563
and I'll sort it out.

40:19.931 --> 40:21.865
Why haven't
I seen this before?

40:21.998 --> 40:25.631
- I'm sure you have.
- No, I would've remembered.

40:25.765 --> 40:27.898
Those dungarees.

40:28.032 --> 40:30.198
My friend Maureen from school
gave you those.

40:30.331 --> 40:33.065
- Why did you hide it up here?
- I didn't hide anything,

40:33.198 --> 40:34.898
it's just where
the old photos are kept.

40:35.032 --> 40:38.831
There's like a million of you
and me downstairs.

40:38.965 --> 40:40.865
I don't know what sort of
dastardly conspiracy

40:40.998 --> 40:42.798
you're accusing me of, Daniel,
I wasn't going to pretend

40:42.931 --> 40:44.398
we were some jolly,
happy family...

40:44.530 --> 40:46.198
He's my dad, though.

40:46.331 --> 40:47.965
Just because he's not
your husband anymore.

40:48.098 --> 40:50.264
I know that, love, and I don't
think I've ever tried

40:50.398 --> 40:52.798
to suggest he isn't a very
important person in your life.

40:52.931 --> 40:54.731
You always say
mean things about him.

40:54.865 --> 40:57.132
No... do I?

40:57.264 --> 40:58.731
Like how he never phones
when he says he will,

40:58.865 --> 41:00.464
how he owes you
loads of money.

41:00.598 --> 41:02.198
When have I ever said
about money?

41:02.331 --> 41:04.831
Every time you speak to him,
and to Auntie Carol.

41:04.965 --> 41:07.098
Well, I'm sorry you've picked
up on that, but you know what,

41:07.231 --> 41:08.965
I do think it's quite shoddy
that he just up and left

41:09.098 --> 41:11.132
when you were eight years old
and only sends money

41:11.264 --> 41:13.798
when it suits him, which is
hardly ever, by the way.

41:13.931 --> 41:15.331
Yeah, well, maybe if you
didn't see him as a bank account

41:15.464 --> 41:17.165
he wouldn't have gone
in the first place.

41:17.297 --> 41:18.931
Hang on, Daniel.

41:19.065 --> 41:21.364
I'm the one who had an actual
job working all hours

41:21.498 --> 41:24.264
while he sank our savings into
ridiculous business schemes,

41:24.398 --> 41:27.297
and then you tell me he's got
a convertible MG!

41:27.431 --> 41:29.464
Well, I'm sorry if I don't
feel too bad for him.

41:29.598 --> 41:32.965
I do! He had to live with
you... no wonder he left!

41:35.765 --> 41:37.364
Well, if that's
what you think,

41:37.498 --> 41:38.731
then that's what you think.

41:42.032 --> 41:45.065
- Where are you going?
- To see a man about a band.

41:45.197 --> 41:47.197
Oh, you're such a villain!
Just leave it.

41:51.598 --> 41:53.032
How'd you even know
it was here?

41:53.164 --> 41:55.631
Ky's got eyes
all over this hood.

41:57.331 --> 42:00.164
- Well, lookee where we are.
- Okay, can we go now?

42:00.297 --> 42:04.865
Relax. I just want
to hear them play.

42:04.998 --> 42:08.698
I'm getting a Megadeth meets
an early Priest sort of vibe.

42:08.831 --> 42:10.965
Not bad, are they?

42:11.098 --> 42:13.098
Sounds like they still
don't have a singer.

42:13.231 --> 42:14.965
But I think we can do
something about that.

42:15.098 --> 42:17.331
- Ky, fuck's sake, don't.
- Trust the Ky-ster.

42:17.464 --> 42:19.998
Please, seriously!

42:20.132 --> 42:24.231
So I hear you... children
are looking for a lead singer.

42:24.364 --> 42:26.331
Well, my friend here,
my client, Mr. Bagnold,

42:26.464 --> 42:28.131
might just be interested.

42:28.264 --> 42:30.499
He's got it all, the whole
package... just look at him,

42:30.631 --> 42:34.998
- he's a god-like creature.
- Uh, there's no one there.

42:35.131 --> 42:38.664
What?

43:00.431 --> 43:01.998
<i>Douglas Porter
is out and about.</i>

43:02.131 --> 43:03.664
<i>Leave a message after the...</i>

43:03.798 --> 43:06.598
Hello, it's Sue,
from the library,

43:06.698 --> 43:10.097
and the other night, Bagnold.

43:10.231 --> 43:13.965
So, I had a nice time and
wondered if you might fancy

43:14.097 --> 43:18.398
meeting up again this weekend
or we could watch a film

43:18.598 --> 43:23.598
or just have dinner again...
not just, I mean, it was lovely.

43:23.664 --> 43:28.398
So, anyway,
you have my number.

43:28.598 --> 43:32.664
Hope to speak soon.

43:38.364 --> 43:41.731
Hi, love!

44:04.698 --> 44:06.598
Those are good
for school as well.

44:06.664 --> 44:08.598
No.

44:08.698 --> 44:11.631
If you could try and describe
what would be acceptable.

44:11.765 --> 44:14.097
I'll know when I see them.

44:14.231 --> 44:15.598
You'd have thought they might
get more styles in

44:15.664 --> 44:18.031
for the new term.

44:18.164 --> 44:19.598
I'm beginning to wonder
whether there are

44:19.698 --> 44:22.898
any you haven't
said no to yet.

44:23.031 --> 44:25.831
- I'd wear those.
- What... which?

44:25.965 --> 44:27.931
Daniel, you're not wearing
trainers to a wedding.

44:28.064 --> 44:29.499
They won't look like
trainers under a suit.

44:29.631 --> 44:32.898
I'm not getting
drawn into this.

44:33.031 --> 44:35.731
Yeah, another complete waste
of my time, isn't it?

44:39.698 --> 44:42.231
- What?
- Nothing.

44:53.798 --> 44:55.598
What are you doing?

44:55.664 --> 44:58.332
Sitting here so I don't
have to look at your face.

44:58.465 --> 45:00.399
Puts me off my food.

45:00.598 --> 45:02.631
Charming.

45:26.831 --> 45:29.164
Oh, hello, Ky.

45:29.298 --> 45:34.164
- Is Daniel in?
- Um, let me go check.

45:34.298 --> 45:36.831
Why don't you wait here
for a minute?

45:45.365 --> 45:48.664
Daniel, Ky's here for you.

45:48.798 --> 45:50.765
I'm not in.

45:50.898 --> 45:55.298
- What shall I tell him?
- That I'm not in.

45:55.432 --> 45:57.399
Are you sure you don't want
to talk to him, love?

45:57.598 --> 45:59.231
How many times?

46:10.131 --> 46:12.698
Sorry, Ky,
he must've gone out.

46:12.831 --> 46:14.164
Any idea where he went?

46:14.298 --> 46:17.164
I think he took
the dog for a walk.

46:17.298 --> 46:22.097
Okay. Um, thanks...
thanks, anyway, Mrs. B.

46:22.231 --> 46:24.164
Do you want me to post
on a message?

46:24.298 --> 46:28.631
Nah, just tell him
that the Ky-man swung by

46:28.765 --> 46:33.765
and tell him he said...
<i>ciao.</i>

46:33.897 --> 46:37.265
Will do. Take care, Ky.

46:56.164 --> 46:58.930
It's supposed to be
nice tomorrow.

46:59.064 --> 47:01.798
I was thinking,
what about a day out?

47:01.930 --> 47:05.831
- Where?
- The seaside?

47:05.964 --> 47:07.598
Since you didn't
get to go to Florida?

47:07.731 --> 47:09.131
I hate the beach.

47:09.265 --> 47:10.997
It's not the beach,
really, is it?

47:11.131 --> 47:13.598
Not like abroad.

47:13.664 --> 47:15.432
It might be fun
to be by the sea.

47:15.598 --> 47:17.198
I'm not going in the sea.

47:17.332 --> 47:19.598
- No, I don't expect you...
- Or on the sand.

47:19.698 --> 47:21.930
I hate sand.

47:22.064 --> 47:27.298
It's a shingle beach,
I think, you know, stones.

47:27.432 --> 47:29.198
So what do you say?

47:29.332 --> 47:31.598
Oh, standing on stone
sounds great.

47:31.698 --> 47:33.265
Oh, come on, Daniel.

47:33.399 --> 47:35.598
We could get fish
and chips, a cream tea,

47:35.698 --> 47:37.798
ride on the big wheel.

47:37.930 --> 47:40.365
Maybe they'll have some
good shoe shops to try.

47:40.499 --> 47:43.964
- I'm not going shoe shopping.
- Okay, no shoe shops.

47:46.365 --> 47:50.830
So that's a yes, to the beach...
I mean seaside?

47:50.964 --> 47:53.731
Yes, fine,
whatever you want.

47:58.365 --> 48:00.698
Oh, I thought maybe
we could chat for a bit.

48:00.830 --> 48:02.731
What about?

48:02.864 --> 48:05.830
Um... we could play I Spy.

48:08.399 --> 48:12.198
Do you remember when we used
to sing together in the car?

48:12.332 --> 48:18.097
♪ You know I
can't smile without you ♪

48:18.232 --> 48:19.930
♪ I can't smile without you ♪

48:20.064 --> 48:22.797
- Pull over.
- Why?

48:22.930 --> 48:24.198
So I can hitchhike home.

48:24.332 --> 48:29.930
Oh, don't be such
a spoilsport.

48:30.064 --> 48:32.064
I know Ky's not on the scene
right now but I wondered

48:32.198 --> 48:33.864
if there was maybe another
friend you'd like

48:33.997 --> 48:35.897
to ask around...
anyone from school?

48:36.031 --> 48:37.797
No.

48:37.930 --> 48:40.864
What about what's his name
from scouts, Matthew?

48:40.997 --> 48:44.764
- Moved to Australia.
- Oh, shame, you got on well.

48:44.897 --> 48:48.598
Yeah, in scouts,
when we were 12.

48:48.698 --> 48:53.132
- Can I listen to my music now?
- I suppose so.

49:52.797 --> 49:56.298
Oh, you planning
on wearing those all day?

49:56.432 --> 49:59.032
- What?
- Never mind.

50:01.598 --> 50:04.065
The history of this area
is fascinating.

50:04.198 --> 50:05.997
Did you know there are
Neolithic flint mines

50:06.132 --> 50:08.997
- a few miles away?
- No.

50:09.132 --> 50:11.830
The fifth millennium BC, that
is actually pretty awesome.

50:11.964 --> 50:14.564
Awesome.

50:14.697 --> 50:16.298
In the proper sense
of the word,

50:16.432 --> 50:20.797
not the empty, meaningless way
you lot use it.

50:20.930 --> 50:22.598
You know, I read something
the other day that said

50:22.730 --> 50:25.499
the earth was almost
entirely covered in sea

50:25.631 --> 50:29.432
until around
2.5 billion years ago.

50:29.564 --> 50:34.165
- Awesome.
- 2.5 billion years.

50:34.298 --> 50:36.930
Puts everything in perspective
a bit, doesn't it?

50:37.065 --> 50:39.531
Yeah, makes me wonder
why we bother.

50:39.663 --> 50:42.830
- Bother what?
- Dunno, with anything.

50:42.964 --> 50:44.897
Don't be so nihilistic.

50:45.032 --> 50:46.630
You're the same...
if you actually thought

50:46.764 --> 50:49.098
anything mattered you'd
do something about it.

50:49.232 --> 50:52.598
You don't,
because there's no point.

50:52.730 --> 50:54.998
Where does this come from,
like what?

50:55.132 --> 50:56.598
You're always saying you
should join the Green Party

50:56.663 --> 50:58.730
and learn more about
stuff in the news,

50:58.864 --> 51:02.332
exercise and cook new things.

51:02.465 --> 51:04.965
If I'd known you were keeping
a list of all my many failings.

51:05.098 --> 51:07.797
You asked.

51:07.930 --> 51:09.332
So why not make up
with Ky, then,

51:09.465 --> 51:11.998
if we're all just
little specks of nothing?

51:12.132 --> 51:14.198
Isn't life too short
to hold grudges?

51:14.332 --> 51:19.065
Life's too short
to spend with dickheads.

51:19.198 --> 51:25.032
Can't imagine what he said
or did to make you so upset.

51:25.165 --> 51:28.465
- Is it over a girl?
- No.

51:28.597 --> 51:31.930
- A boy?
- No! God.

51:32.065 --> 51:35.098
- I just want to understand.
- You wouldn't, so leave it.

51:39.165 --> 51:41.597
What you said earlier
about why'd we bother.

51:41.663 --> 51:44.499
Stop analyzing
every tiny thing I say.

51:44.630 --> 51:46.499
It's hardly tiny,
is it, saying

51:46.630 --> 51:51.597
you don't see
the point in anything.

51:51.663 --> 51:53.730
But we're still here,
aren't we?

51:53.864 --> 51:56.265
We can't have mucked
things up too badly.

51:56.399 --> 51:58.597
What, you and me?

51:58.663 --> 52:01.298
I meant you and Ky,
actually, but...

52:05.465 --> 52:08.663
What?

52:08.797 --> 52:10.465
Oh, you want some cake,
don't you?

52:10.597 --> 52:12.265
Oh, well,
if you're offering.

52:12.399 --> 52:15.764
- Fine. No icing.
- No icing, I know.

52:49.032 --> 52:51.198
Shall we skim some stones?

52:51.332 --> 52:53.898
- Uh, I'm all right.
- There's a knack to this.

52:54.032 --> 52:56.432
They say
it's all in the wrist.

52:56.597 --> 53:01.597
Oh! No. Is that better?

53:01.697 --> 53:07.032
No. Ah, okay,
I think that might... unh.

53:07.165 --> 53:09.931
Don't you want to try,
Daniel?

53:10.065 --> 53:13.931
Daniel!

53:14.065 --> 53:16.898
Daniel! I was in the middle
of talking to you...

53:17.032 --> 53:18.797
don't laugh, I'm actually
really annoyed.

53:18.931 --> 53:20.232
Chill out, it was for,
like, five seconds.

53:20.365 --> 53:21.597
Leaving me talking
to myself like that...

53:21.697 --> 53:24.465
very mature, thank you.

53:24.597 --> 53:25.965
Is it time
to go home now?

53:26.098 --> 53:28.597
We haven't been
to the fudge shop yet.

53:28.697 --> 53:30.597
What's at the fudge shop?

53:30.663 --> 53:32.797
Well, what do you think,
Daniel, is at the fudge shop?

53:32.931 --> 53:34.298
It's meant to be quite
interesting,

53:34.432 --> 53:36.132
there's a demonstration.

53:36.265 --> 53:38.965
- Sounds thrilling.
- Honestly, I don't know why

53:39.098 --> 53:40.764
you came if all you're going
to do is stare at your feet.

53:40.898 --> 53:43.697
- Uh, you made me come.
- Made you?

53:43.831 --> 53:45.865
I just wanted us to do something
fun but you're right,

53:45.998 --> 53:47.597
that was stupid of me,
I should've known

53:47.663 --> 53:48.831
you'd just be rude
and ungrateful.

53:48.965 --> 53:50.597
Well, it's not my fault

53:50.730 --> 53:52.332
you're the most
boring person in the world.

53:52.464 --> 53:55.198
We did once used to have quite
a nice time together, you know.

53:55.332 --> 53:57.630
Yeah, but that was before
you became really annoying.

53:57.764 --> 53:59.831
I'm going
to the fudge shop.

53:59.965 --> 54:03.198
Come or don't, I honestly
do not give a monkey's.

54:08.265 --> 54:12.730
Right, who is up
for making some fudge?

54:12.865 --> 54:16.663
Now, first things first,
I am going to need a volunteer.

54:16.798 --> 54:19.865
How about this little urchin
over here?

54:19.998 --> 54:22.431
Not interested,
too cool for fudge.

54:22.597 --> 54:24.798
What about you, kind sir?

54:24.931 --> 54:27.597
Scared of the fudge
demonstrator.

54:27.663 --> 54:31.165
What about the mysterious
gentleman lurking at the back?

54:31.298 --> 54:33.765
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

54:33.898 --> 54:36.065
I can see you,
dressed all in black,

54:36.198 --> 54:38.730
come on, down you come,
out the shadows.

54:38.865 --> 54:41.898
Help me out.
Bit quicker, could be.

54:42.032 --> 54:43.765
Let's get this show
on the road... hello.

54:43.898 --> 54:45.498
What's your name?

54:45.630 --> 54:47.730
- It's Daniel.
- Huh? Nice and loud.

54:47.865 --> 54:49.398
- Daniel.
- Hmm?

54:49.597 --> 54:50.998
- Daniel.
- Daniel! Dan the man.

54:51.132 --> 54:52.898
The man who can.

54:53.032 --> 54:55.398
Bang that with your bonks,
will ya, mate?

54:55.597 --> 54:58.998
Cover those greasy locks.
Health and safety.

54:59.132 --> 55:02.098
That's very nice, it suits you...
dare I say it's an improvement?

55:02.232 --> 55:05.165
So, Dan, how's your day
at the seaside treating you?

55:05.298 --> 55:06.798
It's good.

55:06.931 --> 55:09.998
Oh, blimey, chatty bugger,
isn't he?

55:10.132 --> 55:12.198
Have you walked along
the beach?

55:12.332 --> 55:15.464
- Yeah.
- Yes, tick.

55:15.597 --> 55:17.731
Have you have
fish and chips?

55:17.865 --> 55:20.865
- Yeah.
- Tick.

55:20.998 --> 55:23.198
And now, here he stands
like a prize plum

55:23.332 --> 55:26.765
in a ghastly
blue bonnet, making fudge.

55:26.898 --> 55:28.431
I imagine you weren't
expecting that to happen

55:28.597 --> 55:30.098
when you woke up
this morning.

55:30.232 --> 55:32.065
- Yeah... I mean no.
- No, of course you weren't.

55:32.198 --> 55:34.998
Right, grab your spoon, man,
let's get stirring.

55:35.132 --> 55:38.597
It ain't gonna stir itself.
Who you down here with?

55:38.731 --> 55:40.132
Your girlfriend?

55:40.265 --> 55:41.698
- No.
- No?

55:41.831 --> 55:44.498
Keep it stirring...
mum and dad?

55:44.630 --> 55:46.663
- Just my mum.
- Just your mum.

55:46.798 --> 55:48.798
And where is
Mrs. Dan the Man?

55:48.931 --> 55:51.032
- Here.
- Hello.

55:51.165 --> 55:54.865
Go on, then, what do you
make of this business?

55:54.998 --> 55:57.831
- Well, it's his choice.
- What about dad?

55:57.965 --> 56:00.198
I expect
he's slightly less keen.

56:00.331 --> 56:03.198
I used to have long hair like
you, I thought I was god's gift.

56:03.331 --> 56:06.831
But then my dad took me to one
side and said, "Listen, mate,

56:06.965 --> 56:10.132
you actually look like a bit
of of pellock... lop it off."

56:10.265 --> 56:12.298
So I did, lopped it off,
start again.

56:12.431 --> 56:14.065
Sometimes less is more.

56:14.198 --> 56:17.731
There we go...
he's smiling, he gets it.

56:17.865 --> 56:21.065
Right, you've stopped
stirring altogether now, mate.

56:21.198 --> 56:24.798
Shall we call it a day?
Pop your spoon down there.

56:24.931 --> 56:28.398
There we go, and a round
of applause, maybe?

56:30.597 --> 56:31.998
Lovely, off you go, then.

56:32.132 --> 56:35.798
Thank you, and away...
oh, go on.

56:35.931 --> 56:40.297
Ugh! Horrible stuff.
Absolutely grim.

56:40.431 --> 56:43.998
Right, that's in the bin,
I think, that one.

56:47.032 --> 56:49.498
That was rather fun,
wasn't it?

56:49.631 --> 56:53.765
He was a piece
of work, though.

56:53.898 --> 56:55.698
Well done for
volunteering, love,

56:55.831 --> 56:57.431
for an awful moment
I thought he'd pick on me.

56:57.597 --> 56:59.198
I didn't volunteer.

56:59.331 --> 57:01.898
- What are you doing?
- I want to get in the back.

57:02.032 --> 57:04.597
And have me drive you
like a chauffeur?

57:06.931 --> 57:10.198
Just want to lie down.

57:10.331 --> 57:13.598
You won't fit across the
backseat, it'll be all squished.

57:19.931 --> 57:22.032
Are you sure you won't be
more comfy in the front?

57:22.165 --> 57:23.965
Positive.

57:24.098 --> 57:26.065
I really don't
understand that.

58:16.431 --> 58:18.965
The end of the holidays
could not come soon enough.

58:19.098 --> 58:21.965
- Tell me about it.
- Katie's been out every night

58:22.098 --> 58:24.931
this fortnight till gone 12,
sometimes two or three,

58:25.065 --> 58:28.598
and I have no idea
where she is or who with.

58:28.664 --> 58:31.098
Daniel's barely left
the house in days.

58:31.231 --> 58:33.598
He's had a mysterious
falling out with Ky

58:33.698 --> 58:36.231
and hardly spoken
two words to me since.

58:36.364 --> 58:38.998
- Swap?
- Yes, please.

58:39.132 --> 58:41.865
What about you and your
teacher friend?

58:41.998 --> 58:45.398
Any new taxi
shenanigans to report?

58:45.598 --> 58:49.364
Um, no. Haven't heard
anything since.

58:49.499 --> 58:51.231
Oh...

58:51.364 --> 58:53.731
Probably for the best,
anyway, with Daniel and that.

58:53.865 --> 58:55.765
Maybe he's gone
on a holiday.

58:55.898 --> 59:00.731
- Or he's just not interested.
- Well, his loss.

59:08.164 --> 59:12.231
Would you like some breakfast,
love... bacon sarnie?

59:12.364 --> 59:15.598
There's a letter for you there,
I think it's from your dad.

59:36.164 --> 59:40.131
"Welcome to the world
Miley Joe Bagnold".

59:40.264 --> 59:44.499
Oh, a sweet baby.
What do you think of the name?

59:44.631 --> 59:47.297
- Appalling.
- It's not that bad.

59:47.431 --> 59:48.931
It is, chuck it out.

59:49.065 --> 59:51.598
You might want
to keep it in time.

59:51.698 --> 59:53.598
I know it might not feel like it
now, but once you've met her...

59:53.698 --> 59:55.831
I won't.

59:55.965 --> 59:59.731
Bernie looks well, you'd never
think she just had a baby.

59:59.865 --> 01:00:02.965
Bob looks like...
Bob with a tan,

01:00:03.097 --> 01:00:05.164
and are they false teeth
or has he had them done?

01:00:05.297 --> 01:00:07.865
- They're very white.
- I said put it in the bin!

01:00:07.998 --> 01:00:10.898
No need to raise
your voice!

01:00:14.131 --> 01:00:15.965
Are you absolutely sure
you don't want to...

01:00:16.097 --> 01:00:18.731
It's my post, I can do
what I want with it.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:21.698
I want you to put it
in the bin.

01:00:23.865 --> 01:00:28.564
Now, where were we?
Bacon.

01:00:28.698 --> 01:00:30.631
Shall I do you
an egg as well?

01:00:30.765 --> 01:00:33.531
One, two?

01:00:33.664 --> 01:00:36.131
I'll do you two.

01:00:40.598 --> 01:00:42.631
Daniel, are you
going to be okay?

01:00:42.765 --> 01:00:47.031
- I'm fine.
- Don't fall asleep in there.

01:01:29.399 --> 01:01:31.465
Maybe it's just the age he is
and maybe I'm being

01:01:31.598 --> 01:01:33.598
overly anxious,
but he does seem to have

01:01:33.664 --> 01:01:36.264
retreated into himself.

01:01:36.399 --> 01:01:38.264
He won't say a word about
what happened with Ky

01:01:38.399 --> 01:01:41.698
and I think maybe with this new
baby arriving he's feeling...

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:44.598
Oh, I don't know.

01:01:44.698 --> 01:01:46.798
He was never the most
talkative boy, but...

01:01:46.931 --> 01:01:50.197
Still waters run deep.

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:55.499
I think... he's holding on
to a lot of pain.

01:01:55.664 --> 01:02:00.131
And perhaps...
he isn't the only one.

01:02:00.264 --> 01:02:02.964
What?
Oh, you mean me?

01:02:03.097 --> 01:02:05.164
No, no, this isn't about me,
I'm fine, really.

01:02:05.297 --> 01:02:09.131
Hmm.

01:02:09.264 --> 01:02:13.598
He's reckoning with a lot at the
moment, figuring things out.

01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:18.231
- The music he likes is so...
- Honest?

01:02:18.365 --> 01:02:21.131
Believe me, I know
how tough it can be

01:02:21.264 --> 01:02:23.997
raising a teenager
on your own.

01:02:24.131 --> 01:02:27.097
Ky is a brilliant,
beautiful boy...

01:02:27.231 --> 01:02:32.031
talented, artistic,
sensitive, but...

01:02:32.164 --> 01:02:36.798
Oh, there are days when
it's all so hard... you know,

01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:39.997
chakras are just...

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:45.365
- Yes, yes, exactly, yes.
- Speaking of chakras...

01:02:45.499 --> 01:02:48.298
Well, I think you know what
I'm going to say, hmm?

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:52.598
Oh, yeah... do I?

01:02:52.664 --> 01:02:56.798
Come for a reiki session, do...
25 percent off.

01:02:56.930 --> 01:03:01.598
I think you might be surprised
how nourishing it'll be.

01:03:01.664 --> 01:03:05.097
Gosh, it's not really
my thing, but...

01:03:05.231 --> 01:03:07.997
Well, why not,
you only live once.

01:03:08.131 --> 01:03:09.631
Well...

01:03:18.432 --> 01:03:20.232
Mum?

01:03:20.365 --> 01:03:21.930
Uh, Riley hasn't gotten up
from his bed

01:03:22.064 --> 01:03:24.731
and he hasn't had
anything to eat or drink.

01:03:24.865 --> 01:03:26.964
All the vets be closed.

01:03:35.097 --> 01:03:38.964
He doesn't seem to be
in pain, at least.

01:03:39.097 --> 01:03:41.097
Let's see how he goes tonight

01:03:41.232 --> 01:03:43.298
and we can take him
tomorrow if he's still...

01:03:43.432 --> 01:03:45.365
You think he's gonna die.

01:03:45.499 --> 01:03:50.232
No. I don't know.
Maybe.

01:03:50.365 --> 01:03:52.698
Well.

01:03:52.831 --> 01:03:55.631
He's been slowing down
for a while, hasn't he?

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:58.731
I didn't notice.

01:03:58.864 --> 01:04:01.830
Have you eaten?

01:04:01.964 --> 01:04:04.198
I'll make some sandwiches.

01:04:10.298 --> 01:04:12.031
Do you remember the day dad
brought him home?

01:04:12.164 --> 01:04:16.598
Yes, I was bloody furious, but
it worked out okay in the end.

01:04:19.232 --> 01:04:20.798
You two were always
playing together.

01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:24.598
- Yeah, WWE.
- What?

01:04:24.698 --> 01:04:26.798
You know, like, wrestling.

01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:28.897
Oh, yeah, I'm not sure he used
to like that game very much.

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:34.198
He did. Didn't you, Riles?

01:04:34.332 --> 01:04:36.797
Maybe we should leave him
alone for a bit.

01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:39.298
Try and get some sleep.

01:04:39.432 --> 01:04:41.897
You can,
I don't want to.

01:04:45.897 --> 01:04:49.465
Crikey. I practically lived
in this at university,

01:04:49.598 --> 01:04:51.365
what was I thinking?

01:04:51.499 --> 01:04:54.232
Right, it looks exactly
like all your other jumpers.

01:04:54.365 --> 01:04:58.399
Are you joking? I'll never
wear this color now, awful.

01:04:58.598 --> 01:05:00.598
I thought people were meant
to dress cool in the olden days.

01:05:00.698 --> 01:05:03.298
Well, clearly not me.

01:05:03.432 --> 01:05:06.765
Did you used to, like,
get stoned and stuff?

01:05:06.897 --> 01:05:09.598
- No.
- Everyone did in the '70s.

01:05:09.698 --> 01:05:11.598
I was still a child
when the '70s ended.

01:05:11.731 --> 01:05:13.864
The '80s, then.

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:20.298
There was a lot of it about,
but... didn't really appeal.

01:05:20.432 --> 01:05:23.997
Did you have, like,
boyfriends before dad?

01:05:24.132 --> 01:05:28.830
- Uh, not really.
- What, none?

01:05:28.964 --> 01:05:30.797
I did go out with someone
from the boys comp

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:33.132
for a little while,
but he...

01:05:33.265 --> 01:05:35.198
well, turned out he
was a bit disturbed.

01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:36.997
Had to been
to go out with you.

01:05:37.132 --> 01:05:39.964
It's pretty sad,
actually.

01:05:40.098 --> 01:05:41.598
He passed away.

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:45.265
- What happened?
- He killed himself.

01:05:45.399 --> 01:05:50.698
I don't really know,
there was some family stuff.

01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:53.332
Like I say, he wasn't
a really happy person.

01:05:53.465 --> 01:05:55.031
Shit.

01:05:59.132 --> 01:05:59.698
Mum?

01:06:14.864 --> 01:06:17.165
Oh, love, he's gone.

01:06:28.598 --> 01:06:32.132
You should probably let your dad
know at some point.

01:06:32.265 --> 01:06:34.697
I don't think he'd be
that bothered.

01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:38.797
No, I suppose that's
ancient history to him.

01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:41.864
- He's got fish now.
- Does he?

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:46.232
Yeah. Tropical fish, one of
them's an endangered species.

01:06:46.365 --> 01:06:49.730
Glad to hear he's doing
his bit for conservation.

01:06:49.864 --> 01:06:51.830
He has somebody who comes
and cleans the tank.

01:06:51.964 --> 01:06:54.332
- I bet he has.
- It's massive.

01:06:54.598 --> 01:06:56.697
I bet it is.

01:07:11.964 --> 01:07:14.598
Mum, we've run out of milk!

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:18.298
So?

01:07:18.432 --> 01:07:20.697
So, do you want me
to go and get more?

01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:23.032
Yes, please.

01:07:57.897 --> 01:07:59.897
So have you guys auditioned
a lot of people?

01:08:00.032 --> 01:08:02.165
- Nah.
- We're taking our time,

01:08:02.298 --> 01:08:05.930
- waiting for the right person.
- Okay.

01:08:06.065 --> 01:08:08.065
Do you know "Gates of Hell"
by Death Certificate?

01:08:08.198 --> 01:08:10.132
Yeah.

01:08:10.265 --> 01:08:14.630
- Okay. Whenever you're ready.
- What, just sing it?

01:08:14.764 --> 01:08:16.930
Uh, yeah?

01:08:17.064 --> 01:08:21.930
- I'll count you in.
- Okay, cool.

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:22.630
Okay.

01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:28.232
I'm ready.

01:08:28.365 --> 01:08:33.432
Okay, boys. One, two,
one, two, three, four.

01:08:54.064 --> 01:08:57.863
So we discussed it
and we made a decision.

01:09:03.596 --> 01:09:05.596
You're in,
you're in the band.

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:10.830
- Cool.
- Welcome, brother.

01:09:10.965 --> 01:09:13.332
So all we're missing now
is a band name... any ideas?

01:09:13.465 --> 01:09:18.898
I dunno, something like,
I don't know, what about...

01:09:19.032 --> 01:09:21.898
- Skull Slayer?
- What?

01:09:22.032 --> 01:09:24.865
Skull Slayer,
I don't know.

01:09:24.997 --> 01:09:28.697
- Skull Slayer.
- I don't know.

01:09:28.830 --> 01:09:30.764
We need another
band meeting to vote.

01:09:30.898 --> 01:09:32.865
Shall I wait here again or...

01:09:32.997 --> 01:09:34.997
Oh, no, 'cause you're
in the band now.

01:09:35.131 --> 01:09:39.064
All those in favor of
Skull Slayer, raise your hand.

01:09:41.032 --> 01:09:43.399
Oh, yes, I wasn't sure
if I was supposed to...

01:09:43.596 --> 01:09:46.596
Yeah.

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:49.298
Landslide.
Skull Slayer it is.

01:09:49.432 --> 01:09:51.131
Let's get back to work, boys.

01:11:11.065 --> 01:11:13.597
How's it been
without your Ronnie?

01:11:13.730 --> 01:11:15.765
Oh, you must miss him
terribly.

01:11:15.898 --> 01:11:19.998
Oh, Riley. Yeah, it's strange,
I keep forgetting.

01:11:20.132 --> 01:11:22.898
Well, you know, the house
is still full of his spirit.

01:11:23.032 --> 01:11:25.630
And it will hit me again,
the absence.

01:11:25.765 --> 01:11:27.998
Oh, Sue.

01:11:28.132 --> 01:11:33.398
Shall we begin, if you'd like
to hop onto the bed, here?

01:11:33.597 --> 01:11:35.431
That's super.

01:11:35.597 --> 01:11:38.165
Now, just gonna scan
your body to see if there are

01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:42.498
any areas that need
any special attention.

01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:44.831
Okay, Sue?

01:11:49.498 --> 01:11:53.265
Ah...

01:11:53.398 --> 01:11:57.498
Am I right?

01:12:16.232 --> 01:12:18.398
I'm sorry.

01:12:18.597 --> 01:12:21.132
I don't know
what's come over me.

01:12:21.265 --> 01:12:22.597
It's okay.

01:12:22.663 --> 01:12:25.232
Let it out.

01:12:29.431 --> 01:12:32.364
I'm so embarrassed.

01:12:32.498 --> 01:12:34.597
It's my birthday this week
and for some reason

01:12:34.663 --> 01:12:40.265
that always makes me
feel quite... sorry.

01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:42.765
No, I'm sorry.

01:12:42.898 --> 01:12:45.798
I could sense you were
channeling some...

01:12:45.931 --> 01:12:50.965
very powerful energies,
I've should've warned you.

01:12:51.098 --> 01:12:55.597
But actually, you know what,
I feel great.

01:12:55.731 --> 01:12:58.597
I haven't really
let go like that since for...

01:12:58.664 --> 01:13:01.198
I can't remember.

01:13:01.331 --> 01:13:03.798
You're welcome.

01:13:03.931 --> 01:13:06.232
Order whatever you'd like.

01:13:06.364 --> 01:13:07.898
I think I'm going
to try these balls.

01:13:08.032 --> 01:13:12.331
- What?
- The risotto balls.

01:13:12.464 --> 01:13:13.698
Are you having a starter?

01:13:13.831 --> 01:13:15.731
Uh, yeah,
garlic bread.

01:13:15.865 --> 01:13:17.331
And what about
for your main?

01:13:17.464 --> 01:13:19.597
- Pizza.
- Bread and more bread.

01:13:19.698 --> 01:13:20.597
Yeah, what's wrong
with that?

01:13:20.731 --> 01:13:23.798
Nothing, nothing at all.

01:13:23.931 --> 01:13:25.731
Do you know
what you're having?

01:13:25.865 --> 01:13:27.765
Yes, I'll have
the aran-chini.

01:13:27.898 --> 01:13:30.831
- Arancini.
- Oh, arancini.

01:13:30.965 --> 01:13:36.098
- Oh, I see, like Puccini.
- Uh, yeah. For your main?

01:13:36.232 --> 01:13:39.631
The ribbons of pasta
with wild mushrooms in tarragon

01:13:39.765 --> 01:13:42.198
in delicious
creamy white sauce.

01:13:42.331 --> 01:13:44.798
Tagliatelle. And for you?

01:13:44.931 --> 01:13:47.731
Garlic bread
and Mt. Vesuvius.

01:13:47.865 --> 01:13:51.865
- It's very hot.
- I can handle it.

01:13:51.998 --> 01:13:53.898
- And to drink?
- Glass of the Riesling,

01:13:54.032 --> 01:13:57.598
please, and Daniel,
would you like a beer?

01:13:57.731 --> 01:14:01.331
Yeah, sure, um...

01:14:01.464 --> 01:14:04.165
I'll have the lager.

01:14:04.297 --> 01:14:08.297
Lager? Okay.

01:14:08.431 --> 01:14:10.598
- Lovely, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

01:14:15.032 --> 01:14:18.198
- You're in a good mood.
- No, I'm not.

01:14:18.331 --> 01:14:21.698
The beer is just because it's
a special occasion, okay?

01:14:21.831 --> 01:14:23.398
- You offered it.
- I haven't forgotten

01:14:23.598 --> 01:14:26.464
about that night...
You know what I'm talking about.

01:14:26.598 --> 01:14:28.698
That was weeks ago, you can't
tell me off about it now,

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:31.998
- that's not how it works.
- I'm just saying.

01:14:32.132 --> 01:14:35.865
Never mind.

01:14:35.998 --> 01:14:39.598
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

01:14:39.664 --> 01:14:41.331
Makes a change from... well,
I was going to say pizza,

01:14:41.464 --> 01:14:42.998
but you're having pizza,

01:14:43.132 --> 01:14:47.664
so it makes it a change
from frozen pizza.

01:14:47.798 --> 01:14:49.598
So, are you having
a nice birthday?

01:14:49.664 --> 01:14:52.765
Yeah, lovely, thanks.

01:14:52.898 --> 01:14:54.197
Did you have
a cake at work?

01:14:54.331 --> 01:14:56.431
Oh, no one knows
it's my birthday.

01:14:56.598 --> 01:14:58.264
Why didn't you
just say it?

01:14:58.398 --> 01:15:00.431
Well, because you don't,
really, at my age, anyway.

01:15:00.598 --> 01:15:02.598
Why not?

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:04.731
You'll understand
when you're older.

01:15:04.865 --> 01:15:06.831
Though it's not really
the same for men.

01:15:06.965 --> 01:15:10.598
- I'm not sexist.
- It's just how things are.

01:15:14.998 --> 01:15:17.098
So Astrid mentioned
Ky's joining a gym.

01:15:17.231 --> 01:15:20.098
- Yeah, he's trying to bulk up.
- Gosh.

01:15:23.998 --> 01:15:26.664
Is that something
you're interested in?

01:15:26.798 --> 01:15:28.731
Is everything all right?

01:15:28.865 --> 01:15:30.765
Yeah, it's fine,
all right.

01:15:30.898 --> 01:15:34.164
- You're all hunched over.
- This is how I sit.

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:35.865
How's your pasta?

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:37.164
Very nice,
would you like a bit?

01:15:39.998 --> 01:15:42.865
- Daniel!
- Sorry.

01:15:42.998 --> 01:15:46.098
- It went all over my dinner.
- I said I was sorry.

01:15:48.965 --> 01:15:50.598
Probably just as well,
anyway.

01:15:50.731 --> 01:15:52.598
Save some room for dessert.

01:15:52.698 --> 01:15:53.931
- Can't we just go now?
- Why?

01:15:54.065 --> 01:15:56.998
- I'm full.
- Too full for ice cream?

01:15:57.131 --> 01:16:00.765
Well, if you will polish off
an entire pizza in two minutes,

01:16:00.898 --> 01:16:03.231
but I would like some dessert
on my birthday if you...

01:16:13.231 --> 01:16:17.598
- You okay, mum?
- Yes, why wouldn't I be?

01:16:18.798 --> 01:16:20.931
Should we go?

01:16:21.065 --> 01:16:24.598
No, I would like
some ice cream.

01:16:24.664 --> 01:16:26.664
Right, and I will too.

01:16:26.798 --> 01:16:30.364
And another
glass of wine.

01:16:30.499 --> 01:16:33.197
I mean, you spend far more
time marking and doing paperwork

01:16:33.331 --> 01:16:35.131
than you do in the classroom
actually teaching.

01:16:35.264 --> 01:16:36.731
It's...

01:16:36.865 --> 01:16:39.131
Oh, hello, Mr. Porter.

01:16:39.264 --> 01:16:41.264
Bit of a favorite haunt,
this, is it?

01:16:41.398 --> 01:16:43.931
Hello, there.

01:16:44.065 --> 01:16:47.197
- Sue.
- Sue, of course.

01:16:47.331 --> 01:16:51.465
How funny to see you here.
This is Nancy.

01:16:51.598 --> 01:16:55.865
Yes, Aaron Baker's mum.
I'm Daniel Bagnold's mum.

01:17:01.631 --> 01:17:04.297
Well, I'll leave you two
to it.

01:17:04.432 --> 01:17:06.297
Have a lovely evening.

01:17:10.499 --> 01:17:11.731
Is that Aaron Baker's mum?

01:17:11.865 --> 01:17:14.131
- It was indeed.
- Gross.

01:17:14.264 --> 01:17:15.865
She could do better.

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:17.197
Anyway, who needs us,
slippery old fish,

01:17:17.331 --> 01:17:18.965
when I have a lovely young man
on my arm.

01:17:19.097 --> 01:17:21.031
Mom! Ugh!

01:17:21.164 --> 01:17:24.664
Come on, let's go home
and see what's on telly.

01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:06.997
Daniel,
if you don't get down here

01:18:07.131 --> 01:18:10.297
and have your toast we'll be
late for the wedding!

01:18:10.432 --> 01:18:11.765
Coming!

01:18:19.731 --> 01:18:22.164
I'm wearing a hat.

01:18:22.297 --> 01:18:26.598
- Yeah, I can see that.
- And you look smart.

01:18:26.731 --> 01:18:29.598
No, honestly,
you look very handsome.

01:18:29.731 --> 01:18:33.432
My little boy's a man.

01:18:33.598 --> 01:18:35.964
Where's this toast?

01:18:42.698 --> 01:18:43.997
You look good in black, mum.

01:18:44.131 --> 01:18:46.432
Yeah, it's meant to be
slimming, black.

01:18:46.598 --> 01:18:50.399
You really think
it looks okay?

01:18:50.598 --> 01:18:52.197
And you've washed your hair.

01:18:52.332 --> 01:18:56.264
Does it look all...
weird and fluffy?

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:59.332
No, love.

01:19:07.197 --> 01:19:09.298
You're going to eat
that chicken?

01:19:09.432 --> 01:19:11.930
No, I don't eat meat.

01:19:12.064 --> 01:19:14.231
You ate the ham
it was wrapped in.

01:19:14.365 --> 01:19:17.598
Yeah, I eat ham.

01:19:17.731 --> 01:19:20.197
- Can I have it?
- Yeah, sure.

01:19:23.332 --> 01:19:26.164
Uh, so your mum says
you're in some band now?

01:19:26.298 --> 01:19:28.731
- Yeah.
- Really? What do you play?

01:19:28.865 --> 01:19:31.865
- I'm the front man.
- What have you been on?

01:19:31.997 --> 01:19:36.798
We're just signing up, our
manager's signing up some gigs.

01:19:36.930 --> 01:19:39.831
- Do you know The Shed?
- Yeah, been there loads.

01:19:39.964 --> 01:19:41.765
So actually there.

01:19:41.897 --> 01:19:43.631
Cool, I'll make sure
I look out for you.

01:19:43.765 --> 01:19:46.097
- What are you called?
- Daniel.

01:19:46.231 --> 01:19:50.365
- Weird name for a band.
- Oh... Skull Slayer.

01:19:50.499 --> 01:19:52.231
Nice.

01:19:55.631 --> 01:19:57.564
Um, have you finished
with your chicken?

01:19:57.698 --> 01:19:59.298
Knock yourself out.

01:20:16.432 --> 01:20:17.731
Maybe the next one.

01:20:17.864 --> 01:20:19.930
You said that
for the last six songs.

01:20:20.064 --> 01:20:23.131
So let's hope the next one's
a good one.

01:20:40.731 --> 01:20:42.698
I brought you some cake.

01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:45.399
I shouldn't, really,
but...

01:20:45.531 --> 01:20:48.897
I got a piece
with lots of icing.

01:20:49.031 --> 01:20:52.531
Mmm!
Would you like a bit?

01:20:52.664 --> 01:20:55.765
Yeah, all right.

01:21:15.914 --> 01:21:20.914
