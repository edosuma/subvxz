12:28.680 --> 12:30.040
Marie Winter has made
an allegation

12:30.080 --> 12:31.240
we need to investigate.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.360
Well, she's hardly someone
to be listened to.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.240
It's a serious allegation,
Governor.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.720
Well, what has she said?

12:39.760 --> 12:42.160
We need to speak to one of your
prisoners, Ruby Mitchell.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.920
Can I ask why?

12:45.960 --> 12:47.920
It relates to the death
of Danny Winter.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.080
Marie Winter claims

12:52.120 --> 12:53.520
you followed Danny from the bar

12:53.560 --> 12:54.800
to the carpark,
where you attacked him.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.920
What? That's bullshit.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.760
She says that's you.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.560
She's lying.

of your neck, then?

13:05.320 --> 13:06.560
Yeah, go for it.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.760
Part your hair, please.

13:16.320 --> 13:17.440
What's that?

13:20.040 --> 13:21.560
It's a scar.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.200
It looks like you tried
to burn off a tattoo.

13:23.240 --> 13:26.440
I had a car accident.
My whole body's full of scars.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.440
You can have a look if you want.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.440
So Marie is after Ruby, not you?

13:32.480 --> 13:34.760
What, does she really think
Ruby killed her son?

13:34.800 --> 13:37.320
Well, it explains why she's so
keen to get back into General.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.120
-Yeah, I suppose.
-Ann.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.800
Hey. Why are there so many
officers in the Protection Unit?

13:42.840 --> 13:44.600
It's ridiculous for
the number of women.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.200
Well, the state's worst
offenders are in there.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.880
You've got rapists,
baby killers and paedophiles.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.600

compromise on safety.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.160

13:53.600 --> 13:55.800
OK, they're all
A-Class prisoners.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.840
Surely keeping them alive
protects your revenue stream.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.680
Hey, how'd you go?

14:02.720 --> 14:04.520
We need to take a look
at Mitchell's prisoner file.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.320
Sure thing.
Uh, you'll need a warrant.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.360

14:08.400 --> 14:09.680
Yeah.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.920

14:17.680 --> 14:19.280
Well, it's standard protocol.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.920
Aren't we all on the same team?

14:20.960 --> 14:23.400
I want to make sure I'm doing
everything by the book.

make the accusation?

14:40.440 --> 14:41.800
'Cause she's insane.
