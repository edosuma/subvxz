WEBVTT

00:05.505 --> 00:07.132
(indistinct chatter on TV)

00:14.097 --> 00:15.682
(knocking on door)

00:16.558 --> 00:18.435
-Yeah, who is it?
-SID: It's me, Norm.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.815
(clears throat)

00:27.193 --> 00:28.695
-Hey.
-What if I was asleep, huh?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.530
I know my man better than that.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.699
So, uh, what's going on, Sid?

00:32.782 --> 00:37.370
I think yours truly
is finally making some progress.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.371
Progress? How?

00:38.455 --> 00:41.624
Well, I got confirmation,
certain gendarmes

00:41.708 --> 00:44.377
have been moving some stuff
over the last few months.

00:44.627 --> 00:45.628
It's a guy named Freddy Jerome,

00:45.712 --> 00:47.338
who's this far away from give me the name.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.007
-They move coke?
-No, prunes.

00:49.090 --> 00:52.469
Look, Norm, who's ever framing you
for stealing the suitcase

00:52.552 --> 00:54.137
makes sense maybe they sold some of it.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.180
Where's this guy Freddy live?

00:55.263 --> 00:57.140
-No, uh-uh, Norm-- Hey.
-I'm going crazy.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.183
Norm-- Norman!

00:58.266 --> 01:01.936
You're doing <i>niente</i> until we find out
who's giving you the inside shiv.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.773
-Come on.
-Okay, all right, all right. It's just...

01:05.940 --> 01:08.193
I'm just afraid they're gonna
take my job from me, Sid.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.862
You wanna help?
Let me hold whatever cash you got.

01:10.945 --> 01:14.199
This guy Freddy's gonna take some
encouraging before he gives me the names.

01:14.908 --> 01:15.992
Here, come here.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.499
-Here, I only got 38 bucks.
-Thirty-eight bu--?

01:23.333 --> 01:25.043
All right, that's good. I'll get more.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.003
Norm, no mistakes.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.255
Remain at Chez Buntz.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.508
Hey.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.302
I appreciate what you're doing, Sid.

01:34.385 --> 01:36.179
-(gunfire on TV)
-Look at that.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.850
They're ruining those movies
with that colorizing thing.

01:44.979 --> 01:45.814
(door shuts)

01:47.565 --> 01:48.858
REPORTER (on TV):
<i>We interrupt for this bulletin</i>

01:48.942 --> 01:50.652
<i>from the Channel Seven news room.</i>

01:50.735 --> 01:54.614
<i>A fire has broken out in the Hill Street</i>
<i>Station House of the Metropolitan Police.</i>

01:57.408 --> 01:58.785
(truck engine starts)

01:59.494 --> 02:01.287
MAN: All right, we're clear,
let's head back.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.670
Uh, where do we stand?

02:09.295 --> 02:11.506
Extensive smoke and water damage, Captain.

02:12.090 --> 02:16.261
We are doing a shear and stress test
and see if the structures has held up.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.595
Can we work here?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.848
Have preliminary status for you
in a few minutes.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.810
Ready for more, Captain?

02:25.061 --> 02:26.604
Two hookers killed on Van Buren.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.814
Strangled with piano wire.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.775
Yeah, that's the MO
on those Heights strangulations.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.027
That phone's dead.
That other one's working.

02:33.111 --> 02:36.114
All right, tell the Heights we want their
complete profile on the Piano Wire Killer.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.031
Yes, sir.

02:39.075 --> 02:41.161
Can you believe this, Captain?
You believe he'd go this far?

02:41.244 --> 02:42.328
What are you talking about?

02:42.412 --> 02:44.330
I knew Lieutenant Buntz
was a loose cannon,

02:44.956 --> 02:46.749
but I never thought he'd go
endangering people's lives.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.127
You think Lieutenant Buntz
had something to do with this fire?

02:50.795 --> 02:51.629
Levelling, Captain?

02:52.380 --> 02:53.506
We're very close to filing charges

02:53.590 --> 02:55.800
on the evidentiary theft
the cocaine from the suitcase.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.343
How do you figure a guy like that, huh?

02:58.094 --> 02:59.345
Maybe he wants to bring
the whole house down with him.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.680
Lieutenant Shipman...

03:01.306 --> 03:03.433
we're hip-deep here in fire marshals.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.643
No one's raised the possibility of arson!

03:05.727 --> 03:08.146
I've been told they can show me
the spot on the fuse box

03:08.229 --> 03:09.480
where the current overloaded!

03:09.689 --> 03:12.192
-The Heights file's on its way, Captain.
-Thanks, Jenkins.

03:12.275 --> 03:15.320
If you have enough to arrest Buntz
for stealing evidence, go ahead and do it.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.572
-Why the angry tone of voice?
-Otherwise, leave us alone!

03:19.782 --> 03:20.617
Captain.

03:21.868 --> 03:22.994
What's our status?

03:23.077 --> 03:25.038
Your, uh, power's hit bad.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.873
And you got the wet
and you got the stink--

03:26.956 --> 03:31.169
I've also got a serial killer
and an IAD investigation in progress.

03:31.419 --> 03:34.297
If it's possible not to relocate,
that's how I'd like to proceed.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.258
Okay, if you're willing to deal
with all that right now,

03:37.342 --> 03:39.010
your base structure is holding up.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.012
The only area
that I'd make a question mark

03:41.095 --> 03:42.472
is back there in the corner.

03:43.389 --> 03:44.974
(men shouting)

03:47.185 --> 03:48.603
Otherwise, you should be all right.

03:48.686 --> 03:51.522
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:51.606 --> 03:53.399
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:53.483 --> 03:57.195
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:57.278 --> 03:58.863
(sirens wailing)

04:04.619 --> 04:07.622
(theme music playing)

05:50.266 --> 05:53.311
(indistinct chatter)

05:53.394 --> 05:57.315
Are we following some organized regimen
here, Sergeant, as to clean-up?

05:58.483 --> 06:01.611
Well, uh, everyone handles
the area they work in.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.863
I guess we're lucky
the joint's still standing.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.492
Only temporarily.
No doubt they will level and rebuild.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.952
-No kidding.
-Lieutenant, Sergeant.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.288
-Chief.
-Melancholy event, hm?

06:12.372 --> 06:13.956
When's the new building go up, Chief?

06:14.415 --> 06:15.750
Not my department, Sergeant.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.755
(phone ringing)

06:20.838 --> 06:21.672
Gentlemen.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.217
Two seconds on another matter.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.221
Charges filed yet on our friend Buntz
for stealing that cocaine?

06:28.304 --> 06:29.806
-Not yet.
-I want them filed, Frank.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.099
Talk to IAD.

06:31.182 --> 06:34.143
I want our losses cut with that throwback.

06:34.769 --> 06:38.106
So what page are we on
with these hooker murders?

06:40.149 --> 06:44.112
I won't ask Detective Penzickis
what page he and his task force are on.

06:44.612 --> 06:45.947
Oh, Penzickis, duck.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.033
They've been on page one
since the unit was formed ten months ago.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.702
Hey, we're just doing what mortals can,
Chief, you know?

06:51.786 --> 06:53.663
Which obviously does not include
catching the killer.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.127
Frank, I know today's
a logistical nightmare,

06:59.210 --> 07:00.711
but I want you full bore on that maniac.

07:00.795 --> 07:04.882
Detective Penzickis got us up to speed
on what the task force has developed.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.343
FLETCHER: I'm sure that was a highly
informative conversation.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.887
Did you show them the piece
in the <i>Law Enforcement Monthly</i>

07:09.971 --> 07:12.974
where we're second from the top
in multiple unsolved homicides?

07:13.683 --> 07:14.934
We gotta go somewhere, Chief.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.020
Detective Penzickis is here
to cooperate with you, Captain,

07:18.104 --> 07:19.564
under your supervision,

07:19.647 --> 07:22.483
and Lieutenant Goldblume's,
if you catch my drift.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.612
I understand they've decided
to level the precinct house.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.072
Put up another building.

07:28.156 --> 07:28.990
-FRANK: Oh?
-Yeah.

07:29.490 --> 07:34.287
Suppose a fire's the sort of nudge
the bureaucracy needs to modernize, huh?

07:35.288 --> 07:36.289
(scoffs)

07:37.123 --> 07:38.833
-(glass shatters)
-What a guy.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.794
You know, it's baffling,
but ever since I been on the force,

07:41.878 --> 07:43.546
I have been the chief's fair-haired boy.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.215
(loud crash)

07:46.299 --> 07:48.926
Don't talk to me about
letters of appeal, mister.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.096
You IRS people garnishee
my paycheck right out of left field.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.098
Now, my wife has to buy groceries.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.393
I wanna know who to talk to!

07:59.228 --> 08:00.438
Yes, I will wait.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.193
The coffee area is off-limits, Sid--
what's left of it.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.737
Listen, fellas,
the guy's name is Freddie Jerome.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.614
I got him positioned to come forward.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.449
All I gotta do
is grease the wheel a little.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.783
What are you saying, Sid?

08:13.701 --> 08:15.745
You're gonna bribe the guy to lie
so Buntz gets off?

08:15.828 --> 08:19.540
No, I got him positioned
to come forward to tell the truth.

08:19.999 --> 08:20.833
What's the matter with you guys?

08:20.917 --> 08:23.794
-You think Lieutenant Buntz did this?
-It's hard to know what to think, Sid.

08:23.878 --> 08:28.007
Well, I'm telling you Lieutenant Buntz
did not pinch a suitcase full of soda.

08:28.090 --> 08:28.925
I know.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.219
I tried to talk him into doing it.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.387
Whatever, Sid. A sawbuck is all I got.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.805
That's it? Fellas.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.849
-I got... 25.
-All right.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.434
-This to help Lieutenant Buntz?
-Yeah.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.811
I thought you and Buntz didn't get along.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.233
I got, uh, 16 bucks.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.986
Sixteen-- 16 bucks?
You guys gotta get a pay raise.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.196
-I know.
-Hey, Norm.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.740
-Norman, you promised--
-Out of my way, Sid.

08:52.823 --> 08:53.699
Norman!

08:54.283 --> 08:56.077
Lieutenant Buntz, it's my understanding

08:56.160 --> 08:59.163
that you are suspended
and denied these premises?

08:59.247 --> 09:00.081
Leave me alone.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.710
Fay, Fay, listen. No. No, don't redeposit.

09:05.169 --> 09:07.463
I'll go by the bank tonight
after I pick up Frank, Jr.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.589
I'll give you a new check.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.424
All right?

09:12.093 --> 09:12.927
Sorry.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.889
Well, of course it'll never happen again,
it never does.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.224
(chuckles)

09:18.307 --> 09:19.267
(clears throat) Yeah.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.394
Thank you.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.315
-Captain.
-Norman?

09:27.775 --> 09:30.069
(sighs) Norman, I'm wondering
what you're doing here.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.487
I mean, what good do you think you can do?

09:31.571 --> 09:34.240
Uh... look, I'm going over and over
in my head, Captain.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.285
I'm not getting an honest count
from this IAD guy.

09:37.368 --> 09:41.038
Can we get something going up here?
Some sort of, uh, shadow investigation?

09:41.122 --> 09:42.957
That is so far out of policy.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.251
To investigate the evidence logs,
the theft.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.295
We don't have venue.

09:48.045 --> 09:50.590
If I assign men,
that's a transparent intrusion.

09:51.173 --> 09:52.008
Captain, look...

09:52.592 --> 09:55.678
I explained to Shipman
the money in my apartment.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.015
He didn't question that.
He seemed to accept that.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.309
Then they suspend me.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.936
Obviously, they feel they have
more than they're saying.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.772
Well, if they have more,
it's crap because I didn't do anything.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.404
-What do you think?
-I'm playing it right down the middle.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.990
Yeah, well, that's because what
a captain does, all right?

10:16.073 --> 10:21.329
And, uh... I, uh, I had a few scrapes,
a few officer involves...

10:22.705 --> 10:23.539
But, Captain...

10:25.458 --> 10:27.793
One thing you ought to know
about Norm Buntz,

10:27.877 --> 10:32.465
which is why I didn't do this, Captain,
it's why it don't even make sense.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.842
I don't need the money, Captain.

10:34.925 --> 10:38.095
Guys who do this, they're either jammed up

10:38.179 --> 10:40.431
or it's what they like,
they like having lots of money.

10:40.514 --> 10:44.518
What I like is people
don't screw around with me.

10:44.852 --> 10:45.686
That's A.

10:46.062 --> 10:49.482
And B... I like being a cop.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.153
I'll have a look into this on my own.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.740
That means no clout, no subpoena power,
but it's the best I can do.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.076
You go home. You go home and stay there.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.039
Look, uh, how about I just
stick around in case--

11:05.122 --> 11:07.458
Norman. Home.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.460
Home and stay there, now.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.139
We were on sector patrol, Lieutenant.
That bag lady hailed us.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.934
I guess she found the bodies
while she was going through the garbage.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.019
-She didn't see anything else?
-No, sir.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.480
-Find these IDs on the bodies?
-Yes, sir.

11:29.897 --> 11:30.815
Bobby, Andy.

11:31.899 --> 11:34.527
Lieutenant, uh, we're not gonna get
very much from that lady.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.864
You fellas wanna do door-to-door
in the surrounding buildings?

11:39.699 --> 11:44.537
I do not know why people trash the area
surrounding their own domicile.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.622
Priority on lab and forensics, please.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.748
You got it, Lieutenant.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.546
They probably worked Dekker and 103rd.
Should probably start there.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.759
-You want more time?
-No, no, let's get out of here.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.471
Any thoughts?

12:03.180 --> 12:06.392
Yeah, just ones I don't want to have.
Hold that for me, would you, please?

12:08.394 --> 12:12.064
I think it's like the other killings,
but, uh... you know, different.

12:15.443 --> 12:16.652
I don't think it's the same guy.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.029
-Copycat?
-Mm-hm.

12:19.780 --> 12:23.617
Listen... I'm the fella behind
the eight ball on this one, Lieutenant.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.663
I am the last guy to ask...
about this stuff, you know what I mean?

12:28.831 --> 12:29.707
Mm, thanks.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.502
You feel okay?

12:34.712 --> 12:36.046
Yeah. Why wouldn't I feel okay?

12:36.464 --> 12:38.382
Aside from the fact
that I got a cash flow problem,

12:38.466 --> 12:40.342
which would make Old Mother Hubbard blush,

12:40.426 --> 12:42.261
and the fact
that I'm in the middle of a divorce,

12:42.344 --> 12:44.180
which is roughly the equivalent
to the sack of Rome,

12:44.263 --> 12:46.515
my existence on this planet is just fine.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.186
Oh, man.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.898
-Got a flat.
-(sighs)

12:57.902 --> 12:59.695
(phone ringing)

12:59.779 --> 13:00.613
WOMAN: Records.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.700
Uh, excuse me.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.995
-Yes?
-The initials on this motion hearing,

13:08.078 --> 13:09.288
are those Judge Levine's?

13:09.997 --> 13:13.542
I mean, I-- Levine is Harold, right?
That doesn't look like an H.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.794
That's 'cause it's an N.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.796
That's Judge Loring's initials.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.256
Judge Nathan Loring, court B-4.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.717
This cocaine hearing
was supposed to be in B-7.

13:21.801 --> 13:22.635
That's Judge Levine's court.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.762
Yeah, but Levine gets backed up

13:24.845 --> 13:26.555
and if it's light
in another part of the courthouse,

13:26.639 --> 13:28.307
they shoot the excess over there.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.560
And the court officers on this list,
are they Levine's or Loring's?

13:32.561 --> 13:35.314
Wachowski, Burton, uh, Levine's, B-7.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.233
So this record doesn't actually tell us

13:37.316 --> 13:39.652
which court officers
handled the evidence in this case.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.196
Hey, we make the records up
when the hearing ready case

13:42.279 --> 13:44.824
exits the hub courtroom. That's 90 a day.

13:44.907 --> 13:48.619
I'm not accusing, but I have to know
who Loring's court officers are.

13:50.788 --> 13:51.747
Well, that would be--

13:51.831 --> 13:54.792
No, no, no, I don't mean that.
I mean in this case.

13:56.544 --> 13:59.213
Oh, man, Captain, you're talking
an hour and a half to go through--

13:59.296 --> 14:01.757
A man's career is at stake here.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.804
Will you go through half of them?

14:10.975 --> 14:12.226
PENZICKIS: Get outta here, would you?

14:12.309 --> 14:13.727
-Penzickis.
-Get out of here.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.188
-Hookers! Hookers!
-I don't get it.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.858
How can't they see it's in
their best interest to talk to us?

14:18.941 --> 14:21.777
You got no idea what kind of control
these guys got over their minds.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.113
I mean, that Nazi propaganda guy--
What's his name?

14:24.196 --> 14:26.198
I think he studied
with the pimps in Munich.

14:26.615 --> 14:28.200
Listen, is lunch
something that's necessary?

14:28.284 --> 14:29.410
Because, you know, I could skip it.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.370
It's okay with me.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.205
I got something I gotta take care of.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.167
You know, actually,
you could do me a favor.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.879
I mean, I have no idea
why you'd want to, but, uh...

14:39.962 --> 14:40.796
Sure.

14:44.258 --> 14:47.011
I gotta go see my wife's divorce lawyer.
You'd find him interesting.

14:47.094 --> 14:49.638
He's one of the few human beings
on the planet with rabies.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.891
-What's the favor?
-Oh, practically nothing.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.226
All you got to do is just sit there,
I'll do all the talking.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.522
Then, um... when I, uh...

14:59.815 --> 15:01.817
When I put my finger
to my eye like this, right--

15:02.443 --> 15:05.738
you go into your pocket like you're gonna
get something and you say to him,

15:05.821 --> 15:09.241
"Shall I show him the pictures now,
Mr. Penzickis?"

15:10.075 --> 15:13.162
That's it? "Shall I show him
the pictures now, Mr. Penzickis?"

15:13.245 --> 15:15.414
Yeah, but you know, when I--
when I touch my eye like this.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.333
What pictures am I referring to?

15:18.334 --> 15:21.211
(sighs) My wife's trying to put
the squeeze on me for alimony.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.922
I'm guessing she's running around.

15:23.505 --> 15:26.717
So maybe if we make the guy
think like we got proof,

15:26.800 --> 15:29.345
then he'll stop these blood-from-stone
experiments, you know?

15:31.013 --> 15:34.224
(unidentifiable accent) Can I show him
the pictures now, Mr. Penzickis?

15:35.267 --> 15:36.268
You're a great American.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.145
(chuckles)

15:41.231 --> 15:42.942
Just going around asking people
a few questions.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.526
Two women were killed last night.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.862
The bodies were found
in the vacant lot next door.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.781
I don't know nothing about it.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.491
You mind if we ask you a few questions?

15:52.034 --> 15:54.620
You see anything last night out here?
Anything unusual? Strange?

15:55.245 --> 15:58.958
No. Junkies. And babies crying.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.418
Us eating off the ironing board.

16:04.004 --> 16:06.465
Your name's Robert. Ain't that right?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.426
Yeah, right. Do you know me?

16:10.970 --> 16:13.180
-Not really.
-Ma'am, this is my card here.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.098
Hill Street Station.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.766
So if you hear anything unusual,

16:15.849 --> 16:17.434
even people talking,
just let me know please.

16:17.518 --> 16:18.978
In the meantime,
thank you very much for your time.

16:19.061 --> 16:19.895
Let's go.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.565
You know me, don't you? From where?

16:25.484 --> 16:26.318
Doesn't matter.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.781
Bobby, will you come on?
We still have three more floors

16:30.864 --> 16:32.658
of valuable interviews to conduct.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.369
Thanks for your time.

16:36.120 --> 16:36.954
Okay.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.213
Shipman overlooked five court officers

16:46.296 --> 16:48.507
because their names never appeared
in the hearing records.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.510
I'm assuming a clerical error,
but technically,

16:51.593 --> 16:53.345
any one of them could have
handled the suitcase.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.514
Cohoe Vernon.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.392
-What about him?
-Damn.

16:58.475 --> 16:59.643
-Damn!
-Norman.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.021
I'll tell you what about him, Captain.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.106
There's a guy named Benedict
at the Heights,

17:04.189 --> 17:05.941
who was trying to steal my snitch.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.943
Must have been pumping him for crap on me.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.320
-Hoping to build a case.
-FRANK: And Cohoe?

17:10.571 --> 17:12.031
They were damn partners.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.993
When Cohoe who was a slug cop,
the two guys were partnered up together.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.205
Dammit. I knew this was
a frame job, I knew it.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.166
Howard? Frank.

17:22.249 --> 17:25.085
We have to get four detectives
over to the federal courthouse right away.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.380
Norman. You're gonna stay put.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.299
You understand? You stay right here.

17:32.926 --> 17:35.179
-Joyce.
-JOYCE: Hi, Irwin.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.100
If this was the Catskills,

17:40.184 --> 17:42.728
and this was my Uncle Haim's
Colony Resort,

17:42.811 --> 17:44.271
they would call this "Jewish lightning."

17:46.315 --> 17:47.149
Something wrong?

17:47.775 --> 17:49.068
My constituents.

17:49.610 --> 17:53.030
Nine killed in the last seven months,
and they go on with business as usual.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.698
I understand it's come home now.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.825
The ones last night
were found in the Hill?

17:59.953 --> 18:00.788
I've got news.

18:01.663 --> 18:03.290
July 1, I'm out of here.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.461
Irwin. What? Private practice?

18:07.544 --> 18:08.962
California. LA.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.340
I've got a cousin there
who's got a real estate firm.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.674
They're expanding
and they need a litigator.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.594
-Half criminal, get into some civil.
-Congratulations.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.638
-I'm really happy for you.
-Thanks.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.183
So, uh... you don't want
to try and talk me out of it?

18:21.266 --> 18:22.392
Try and get me to stay?

18:22.893 --> 18:23.727
Joke.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.401
-MAN: Sergeant?
-LUCY: Yeah?

18:31.777 --> 18:32.986
City fiscal service.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.489
We're gonna keep the repairs
minimal on this day

18:35.572 --> 18:37.658
until we find out
about the structure's future.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.410
But, uh, your electrical is functioning.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.829
Well, more or less, it is.

18:41.912 --> 18:44.289
And this authorizes a reconnect
on your plumbing.

18:44.706 --> 18:45.666
Who's your contractor?

18:46.500 --> 18:48.627
-Uh, Sal Binachi.
-B-minus.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.838
Hey, Sal happens to be
a pretty good plumber.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.214
Hey, use him, use him.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.342
-Hey, aren't you Robert DiNapoli?
-Yeah.

18:55.425 --> 18:56.969
(laughs) I thought that was you.

18:57.052 --> 18:58.554
Tonight on TV you're gonna
open that vault, right?

18:58.637 --> 19:01.181
Well, just came from the demolition site.
I was there with my people, yeah.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.433
-What do you think's in it, you know?
-Gonna find out, aren't we?

19:03.684 --> 19:06.520
Listen, um, sorry.
We just did a run-through.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.982
And, um, I have got zero
visual composition without the cops.

19:10.065 --> 19:13.110
Now, if I can't get night shift cops
assigned to me,

19:13.193 --> 19:16.488
maybe I can hire some daytime cops
who are off duty.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.450
Uh, well, uh, I can
let the day shift know.

19:20.534 --> 19:25.289
Okay. You get me up to eight bodies,
50 bucks apiece for three hours.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.291
I think your arithmetic's a little off.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.294
No, no, no, the extra hundred's for you.
For helping me out.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.005
That's a lot more than anybody else
around here has done.

19:33.088 --> 19:35.924
Well, maybe you didn't notice,
but we had a fire, huh?

19:40.387 --> 19:42.389
Captain, Lieutenant Shipman on line three.

19:44.892 --> 19:45.726
Furillo.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.770
Yeah, you heard right.
We're bringing in Officer Cohoe.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.565
Because you weren't doing
your job, that's why.

19:52.441 --> 19:56.737
No excuses, you blew the Cohoe connection,
you blew the courthouse connection,

19:56.820 --> 20:00.365
and I won't have my man Buntz
subjected to this level of incompetence.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.994
No, no, you won't take him downtown.
We're questioning him here.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.330
Well, you get up here
if you want to hear it.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.375
-We booking, Captain?
-Not yet. Interrogation A.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.169
Irwin, I need you.

20:13.086 --> 20:13.921
Interrogation A.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.298
Leon Durst, Captain,
representing Detective Cohoe.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.633
Now, I know time's a factor.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.135
Yeah, meaning your client knows
we can get the same information

20:20.219 --> 20:22.512
from his running-mate, Detective Benedict.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.848
But in which case,
hypothetically speaking, Captain,

20:24.932 --> 20:28.143
you could be giving away the head guy
to bag a lonely accomplice.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.938
Obviously, your lowly accomplice here

20:31.021 --> 20:34.524
is the guy who broke into a suitcase
containing 80 pounds of cocaine,

20:34.608 --> 20:36.818
for which another cop
has been wrongly accused.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.029
Well, if that's what you
want to settle for, Captain,

20:39.112 --> 20:41.782
but you'll be missing
three quarters of the players.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.158
No games. What has he got?

20:43.617 --> 20:46.912
I gotta walk.
Off the force, okay, but no charges.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.831
No way a free walk.
A free walk is too cheap.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.792
LEON: Now, you wouldn't say that,
gentlemen, if I told you

20:51.875 --> 20:54.294
there's also a high-ranking
police official involved here.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.130
-We can give him to you.
-What official? Doing what?

20:57.839 --> 20:59.174
-In the thick of it.
-Who?

21:00.050 --> 21:02.010
-(laughs) No.
-Rank?

21:07.057 --> 21:08.433
-Lieutenant.
-We can add...

21:09.184 --> 21:11.353
with Internal Division responsibilities.

21:11.436 --> 21:14.273
Come on, Cohoe.
If you have something to tell us--

21:14.356 --> 21:16.358
But I want to make sure I walk.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.568
If he's as big as you say,
and if it sticks,

21:18.652 --> 21:20.404
then you walk, that's all we can offer.

21:21.029 --> 21:23.657
Well, as a matter of fact,
that's all we wanted.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.159
Go ahead.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.664
-Shipman.
-Lieutenant Shipman?

21:31.248 --> 21:33.583
Lieutenant Jim Shipman, IAD.

21:34.001 --> 21:37.296
They had him. Benedict had him
for stealing a captain's test.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.841
Shipman was in their pocket
and they owned him, like they own me.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.137
Uh, we had a deal.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.058
-(knocking on door)
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.896
All right, my friend.
Are you ready for some good news?

21:54.980 --> 21:56.064
What's that, Sid, huh?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.650
You got a message from your great pal,
Detective Benedict?

21:58.734 --> 22:00.068
Huh? He got something for me?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.279
Maybe a lifetime ticket to Lamster's Cove?

22:02.362 --> 22:03.572
What are you talking about?

22:03.655 --> 22:05.741
I'm talking about Vernon Cohoe,
you moron!

22:05.824 --> 22:08.952
Cohoe, wait a minute, that's the name
Freddie J. just found for me.

22:09.036 --> 22:10.996
-I came here to give that to you.
-Well, you're late, Sid.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.998
Furillo had that for me hours ago.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.750
Now, I tell you something, huh?

22:15.125 --> 22:18.045
Cohoe used to partner
with Benny Benedict, huh?

22:18.128 --> 22:20.380
Your big spender Benedict!

22:20.589 --> 22:22.924
-Ah, Norm--
-"Ah, Norm." Yeah, they framed me, Sid.

22:23.008 --> 22:26.470
Benedict framed me and he used you
to get anything he needed.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.096
Aw, Norm, I never thought--

22:28.180 --> 22:30.724
Listen, the only thing I ever said
a word about was the money.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.517
The rest was just plain snitching.

22:32.601 --> 22:33.518
Well, that was enough.

22:35.270 --> 22:36.688
(sighing)

22:38.148 --> 22:41.234
Norm, if Furillo's on to it,
then they got him, right?

22:41.318 --> 22:44.112
-They get the other guy, too?
-What guy, your pal Benedict?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.573
No, the other guy. The guy inside.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.408
Freddie Jerome said nobody's sweating this

22:48.492 --> 22:51.078
because it was somebody
inside the investigation.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.205
-Name.
-Wish to heck I had one for you.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.374
Can't tell you how bad I feel about this.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.086
I don't know, just somebody high up.
That's all I know.

23:00.587 --> 23:01.588
Shipman.

23:03.465 --> 23:06.593
Listen, Norm I got a knot
right here where I breathe.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.970
I know I'm in no position to give advice,

23:09.054 --> 23:11.139
but what I'm seeing,
you're gonna do something nuts.

23:11.515 --> 23:14.518
-Shut up, Sid.
-A: Shipman may not be the name.

23:14.601 --> 23:16.186
And B: they got it already!

23:16.269 --> 23:18.438
Who's they, huh? Shipman is they.

23:18.522 --> 23:21.358
How 'bout maybe Furillo
is sitting on his hands

23:21.441 --> 23:24.152
and Shipman is three-quarters
the way to Acapulco, huh?

23:24.486 --> 23:27.697
Yeah, uh-uh, Lieutenant Shipman,
please, 309--

23:28.782 --> 23:29.991
All right, all right, thank you, yeah.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.326
He's gone. Shipman's left already.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.577
Now, wait a minute, Norm.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.374
(door opens, closes)

23:42.379 --> 23:44.548
(dialing phone)

23:47.426 --> 23:50.512
Yeah, Captain Furillo, please.
Sidney Thurston calling.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.644
I'm a snitch, that's what I do.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.024
One count solicitation.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.235
Hey, I don't need no intake.
Just plead me.

24:05.318 --> 24:07.404
Why don't you catch him?
Why don't you just make him stop?

24:07.696 --> 24:10.073
She knew those two girls,
Candy and Jermaine.

24:10.407 --> 24:11.533
The murdered prostitutes?

24:11.867 --> 24:13.994
Why don't you working girls
help the police a little more?

24:14.077 --> 24:16.246
-I'm sure there's somebody--
-What do you mean, help you?

24:16.788 --> 24:19.332
What's to say if I help you,
he's not gonna come to kill me?

24:20.417 --> 24:23.336
You catch him, you people catch him
before he kills somebody else.

24:25.714 --> 24:26.715
Was she charged?

24:26.798 --> 24:29.426
No, she came in to find out
the names of the two women killed.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.761
-What's her name?
-Cassie.

24:31.928 --> 24:34.431
But don't put me in the middle
of nothing, Ms. Davenport.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.099
Did she do something to you?
Want me to go get her?

24:36.183 --> 24:37.017
No.

24:38.101 --> 24:40.187
Dorine? Fingerprints.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.026
-Couple hours personal time, Sarge.
-You got it.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.737
Irwin, those warrants
on Shipman ready yet?

24:48.820 --> 24:49.905
Should be here by now.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.448
Sid Thurston, Captain, line four.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.118
Hello.

24:56.369 --> 24:58.497
No, I know who you are,
just tell me what you--

25:00.457 --> 25:02.083
All right. Yeah, I'll take it from here.

25:02.876 --> 25:05.879
Irwin, have those warrants follow me.
To Shipman's place.

25:07.631 --> 25:08.465
Call Division.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.051
-Checking on an ethics question, Irwin.
-Shoot.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.886
-A hypothetical conversation.
-Mm-hm.

25:12.969 --> 25:15.764
On three occasions,
which the other party addresses me

25:15.847 --> 25:17.349
as if I'm a member
of the police department.

25:17.432 --> 25:19.976
It's clear she thinks I'm a cop,
she doesn't realize I'm lawyer.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.103
-Query?
-Query, am I bound by privilege

25:22.187 --> 25:24.022
as to the conversation substance?

25:24.105 --> 25:27.400
Thus proving conclusively you dozed
through Legal Canons and Principles 101.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.611
Yes or no, Irwin.
Can I tell someone what she said?

25:30.570 --> 25:31.404
Yes, you can tell them.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.865
-You're not bound.
-Thanks.

25:34.324 --> 25:35.575
You're gonna miss these little chats.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.036
-Shipman warrants for you, Mr. Bernstein.
-Thank you.

25:41.623 --> 25:42.457
Lieutenant Goldblume?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.751
He's in interrogation
with a Detective Penzickis.

25:45.168 --> 25:47.504
Have a police officer forward
these warrants to the captain, please.

25:47.587 --> 25:50.090
All right. See if you can get
Officer Russo to do this.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.510
-Plumbing's reconnected.
-Attaboy, Sal.

25:53.885 --> 25:57.430
Just took a look at the pipes behind
the south wall, where the fire spread.

25:58.139 --> 26:00.183
-So?
-Well, the whole place coulda went.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.351
I keep thinking what coulda happened

26:01.434 --> 26:03.395
if a certain person
were in it when it burned.

26:03.603 --> 26:04.938
Sure don't like thinking about that.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.815
-Oh, come on.
-Have dinner with me.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.693
Her name is Cassie,
she works somewhere in the red zone.

26:10.068 --> 26:10.986
I think you should question her.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.988
I think she knows something
about those murders.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.198
-Who are you?
-She's a lawyer.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.284
What, and you're representing this Cassie?

26:17.367 --> 26:19.411
If I were representing her,
I wouldn't be talking to you.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.037
Thank you. (clears throat)

26:29.754 --> 26:30.589
Good afternoon.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.674
Afternoon, ma'am, um...

26:32.757 --> 26:36.136
There was an incident in the vacant lot
outside your building last night.

26:36.219 --> 26:37.220
I saw.

26:38.346 --> 26:39.514
You saw something, ma'am?

26:39.931 --> 26:41.766
It's been on the television all day.

26:42.100 --> 26:45.020
No, ma'am, what I was asking you is,

26:45.103 --> 26:50.942
that if you actually saw anything
out your window last night.

26:51.192 --> 26:52.611
I'm not hard-of-hearing, sir.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.988
So you didn't see
anything last night, ma'am?

26:55.822 --> 27:00.035
Oh, I-I stay away from the window ever
since Mr. Sussmann passed away.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.662
-It's been nine years--
-Oh, thank you, ma'am.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.414
Oh, let me fix you some tea.

27:04.497 --> 27:06.750
-Uh, ma'am--
-Thank you very much, ma'am.

27:08.335 --> 27:09.794
The tea will be no trouble.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.297
That's okay, ma'am.

27:13.757 --> 27:14.924
Thanks for your time.

27:16.801 --> 27:17.761
Thank you, Officer.

27:20.055 --> 27:20.889
Yeah.

27:22.265 --> 27:24.100
-Thank you, sir.
-(door shuts)

27:24.184 --> 27:27.854
-Buddy, we are in luck.
-Last apartment of the day is empty.

27:27.937 --> 27:29.272
We are finished.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.067
-I get it, too. I get it, too.
-What?

27:32.150 --> 27:34.110
Depression, every time we go
on the door-to-door canvass.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.571
I get so blue by the end of the day,
I could slit my wrists,

27:36.655 --> 27:39.824
but I have a solution; Dr. Renko's
after-shift beers at Slattery's Bar.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.493
-Renko, cut it out.
-I'm not gonna let it get to you.

27:41.576 --> 27:42.535
I'm not gonna let it get to me.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.706
Third place gonna be lucky, Cassie?

27:48.375 --> 27:50.585
Used to be his cousin Tyrone's place.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.837
I'd sleep there during the day.

27:53.129 --> 27:54.839
It's the only other place
I know where he'd be.

27:55.965 --> 27:57.092
You're doing the right thing.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.386
If Dwayne killed those girls...

28:00.470 --> 28:03.890
Just Candy and Jermaine.
Just those two last night.

28:03.973 --> 28:05.266
Oh, well, then he's all right, huh?

28:05.350 --> 28:08.144
Well, the others he brought
to that White man downtown.

28:09.270 --> 28:12.190
He died last month?
The White man downtown?

28:12.273 --> 28:13.733
That's why all the murders stopped.

28:13.817 --> 28:16.152
Then Dwayne got afraid
somebody was gonna tell.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.070
There it is.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.700
Second floor, all the way in the back.

28:22.867 --> 28:23.702
Okay.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.332
-Stay with her. She'll ID.
-Yes, sir.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.042
I don't want to stay here.
I don't want to see him.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.503
Cassie. It's all right.

28:33.586 --> 28:34.879
-Okay.
-I got the door.

28:41.678 --> 28:42.887
Open up, police!

28:47.517 --> 28:48.435
Halt! Police!

28:48.810 --> 28:49.894
Go away!

28:50.687 --> 28:51.521
Stop or I'll shoot!

28:52.230 --> 28:53.440
Penzickis!

28:55.400 --> 28:56.609
Halt!

28:57.444 --> 28:58.403
You're busted, Dwayne.

28:58.486 --> 29:01.948
I don't understand
what you don't understand, Mr. Belker.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.827
The year 1984 return
was kicked out for an audit.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.162
Nineteen-eighty-four...

29:07.245 --> 29:10.039
And you failed to respond
to five mail requests

29:10.123 --> 29:12.625
-to set up an appointment.
-I never got those.

29:12.709 --> 29:13.543
So you say.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.503
So the next step
is you garnishee my paycheck?

29:15.587 --> 29:16.921
Got your attention, didn't we?

29:17.964 --> 29:19.758
See, now I can see why it was kicked out.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.552
It's, uh, this claim
of maternal dependency.

29:22.635 --> 29:26.681
That's correct, I took care of my mother
the last three years she was alive.

29:26.765 --> 29:27.974
I paid her bills.

29:28.057 --> 29:28.933
Can you prove that?

29:29.434 --> 29:31.853
Yes. Yes.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.230
I got all the receipts.

29:35.648 --> 29:42.447
So these, uh, contributions on your part
constituted more than half her income?

29:42.530 --> 29:45.200
It was me, Social Security and bingo.

29:45.992 --> 29:48.453
Yeah, well, as long as you can prove that,
we got no problem.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.915
Now, you can access
her papers and receipts?

29:53.625 --> 29:56.503
-Hers?
-There a problem with that, Mr. Belker?

29:59.297 --> 30:00.757
Can you access them?

30:03.551 --> 30:04.677
Yeah, I guess so.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.812
Unbelievable. Packing a suitcase.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.147
Put that gun away,
and you're under arrest.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.106
No, no. No, no.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.359
You're under suspension,
means that gun is illegal!

30:19.442 --> 30:23.446
Hey, Mr. Internal, I don't think
you got time to arrest me.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.783
-Not with that plane you're gonna--
-(yelling)

30:26.866 --> 30:28.368
(grunts)

30:28.451 --> 30:30.578
All right!
All right, now you tell me, huh?

30:30.662 --> 30:32.163
You tell me all about it, huh?

30:32.247 --> 30:34.624
What you guys did,
how you figured, what'd you think

30:34.707 --> 30:36.084
when you decided
to give me the fall on this!

30:36.167 --> 30:37.252
-Stop!
-Who cares?

30:37.335 --> 30:40.255
He's a freak anyway, so frame the bastard?

30:40.338 --> 30:41.172
What an infant!

30:41.256 --> 30:42.549
Get off him, Norman, let up!

30:42.632 --> 30:45.009
No, no, I'm not so sure, Captain.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.219
-Norman--
-Tell you the truth,

30:46.302 --> 30:48.096
I'm not sure what my move is here.

30:48.596 --> 30:51.599
No, you see, because this is
what's important to me, Captain.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.227
I look down the road,
I don't see me coming out of this a cop.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.271
I don't see how I come out of this okay.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.147
You put down the gun, you give him up!

30:58.231 --> 30:59.983
Or you're never
gonna come out of this okay!

31:05.989 --> 31:07.615
-Come on, Shipman.
-(groans loudly)

31:08.324 --> 31:09.200
Arrest Lieutenant Buntz.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.369
Shipman, too. Under warrant.

31:13.329 --> 31:16.749
I thought he was gonna get away.
I was-- I was only holding him, is all.

31:17.834 --> 31:18.668
I know that.

31:34.183 --> 31:36.978
-Chief.
-Captain, I just spoke to ADA Morrissey.

31:37.061 --> 31:39.188
There'll be no direct
grand jury presentation.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.733
-Chief, on Buntz...
-Stormin' Norman?

31:41.816 --> 31:43.318
Is this necessary?

31:43.401 --> 31:45.320
The gun's a technical felony at worst,

31:45.403 --> 31:49.032
committed under the most extreme pressure
and for understandable reasons.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.242
Rather pin a medal on him, Frank?

31:53.578 --> 31:57.790
Docket N-695611,
Detective Michael Benedict,

31:57.874 --> 31:59.375
charged with grand larceny,

31:59.459 --> 32:02.086
possession of controlled substance,
obstruction of justice.

32:02.170 --> 32:05.465
-People ask 250,000 bail.
-This is after consultation?

32:05.548 --> 32:08.176
Correct. My client expects
the bond to be posted.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.179
Long date. Next.

32:12.013 --> 32:15.934
BAILIFF: Docket N-695599,
Lieutenant Norman Buntz.

32:16.017 --> 32:17.769
Felonious possession of a weapon.

32:17.852 --> 32:20.772
-People are asking 100,000.
-Why?

32:21.481 --> 32:24.692
Why? Because Daniels spoke to Morrissey.

32:24.859 --> 32:26.235
-On bail for Buntz?
-No.

32:27.111 --> 32:29.906
IRWIN: But his nose is so far out
of joint, Frank, over this whole business.

32:29.989 --> 32:31.741
FRANK:
I'll run interference with the chief.

32:32.241 --> 32:35.745
Irwin, please.
What the case is worth, Buntz can make.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.121
(sighs)

32:38.331 --> 32:40.500
Good thing private practice awaits.

32:42.251 --> 32:43.086
Ten thousand?

32:45.964 --> 32:47.840
Your Honor, I misread my papers.

32:47.924 --> 32:50.593
People ask 10,000,
ten percent cash alternative.

32:52.178 --> 32:53.012
Can defendant make that?

32:55.390 --> 32:56.224
Yeah.

32:56.891 --> 32:58.851
You wish to say something more,
Lieutenant?

33:01.479 --> 33:03.231
Nah. No.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.067
-Hi, Tina.
-Hi.

33:07.026 --> 33:08.861
So are you gonna pick up
a quick 50 tonight?

33:09.570 --> 33:10.697
What are you talking about?

33:10.780 --> 33:14.075
The TV guy, he's hiring cops
for window dressing for the TV show?

33:14.701 --> 33:16.536
Bates has the chits, if you're interested.

33:16.619 --> 33:18.746
-Guess not.
-You're not interested?

33:20.206 --> 33:21.124
Okay.

33:22.291 --> 33:24.377
Yo, fellas, in or out on the TV gig?

33:24.460 --> 33:26.671
-In.
-Um, I'm not sure.

33:26.921 --> 33:27.755
All right.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.217
-Okay...
-We set, Detective?

33:31.426 --> 33:33.386
Rendezvous at 6:15.

33:33.469 --> 33:36.597
You set your timepiece, Paulie,
and contact your Swiss banker.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.142
(chuckles)
I've already done it. Everyone's on alert.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.394
Hey, hey, hey, what's happening, Paulie?

33:41.477 --> 33:43.354
Uh, how you doin' there, Detective?

33:43.980 --> 33:44.814
Mm-hm.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.150
Can't be any accident, J.D.

33:47.775 --> 33:48.609
What are you talking about?

33:48.693 --> 33:51.112
Three times within 24 hours
I seen you with Paulie.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.157
It's a free country.
That's what our forefathers fought for.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.074
Uh-huh.

33:55.908 --> 33:57.493
Hey, a cup of coffee, please, Estelle.

33:57.994 --> 34:00.496
'Course, if I didn't think
you were gonna be a prude,

34:00.580 --> 34:02.331
maybe I'd tell you what we got going.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.541
Don't tell me, lover.

34:03.624 --> 34:06.711
Maybe I'd let you in
on some guaranteed <i>dinero.</i>

34:06.794 --> 34:09.172
Plus, that TV hump, Robert DiNapoli,

34:09.255 --> 34:12.008
he gets egg on his puss
in front of however many people

34:12.091 --> 34:13.634
he roped into watching his TV program.

34:13.718 --> 34:15.136
Take the no, J.D.

34:15.219 --> 34:18.181
Neal, Paulie's got the sewer plans.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.558
A back way into that wine cellar.

34:20.975 --> 34:23.352
I mean, it's even legal.
The law of salvage.

34:23.436 --> 34:25.313
We got as much right to it as he does.

34:26.147 --> 34:27.899
-What do you say?
-I say no.

34:28.191 --> 34:30.276
Crawling on my belly through human waste.

34:30.359 --> 34:31.903
That's why they made horse-racing.

34:35.406 --> 34:36.240
Detective.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.826
I got a bunch of telephone
messages for you.

34:43.289 --> 34:45.500
-Everything okay at home?
-No, it isn't.

34:46.459 --> 34:47.335
It's my mother.

34:50.129 --> 34:50.963
Detective.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.840
Nothing gives me greater pleasure

34:52.924 --> 34:55.343
than revising upwards
my opinion of one of my men.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.303
Lieutenant, I'm very proud.

34:57.386 --> 34:58.262
Thank you. Book him.

34:59.097 --> 35:02.100
Be gentle, he's somebody's
son and brother, huh?

35:02.183 --> 35:05.061
I'm from the fire marshal's office, Chief.
If I could just have a couple minutes.

35:05.144 --> 35:07.063
Uh, these reporters are on deadline.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.941
Boys, I'll keep my statement simple.

35:10.691 --> 35:12.610
Just that an arrest like this

35:12.902 --> 35:16.197
is what makes police work
the soul-satisfying vocation it is.

35:16.697 --> 35:20.159
Then Greene's responsible for last year's
string of piano wire murders?

35:20.243 --> 35:23.204
Well, my understanding,
that's a rather complicated situation.

35:23.287 --> 35:27.542
I wouldn't want to prejudice any juries.
But I will say that I'm breathing easier.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.795
But what about these reports that
they're tearing down Hill Street, Chief?

35:30.878 --> 35:33.214
Yeah, new building's gonna have
a sauna and ping-pong rooms

35:33.297 --> 35:34.132
and from what I hear, it's gonna be--

35:34.215 --> 35:36.801
-Well, I haven't actually seen any plans.
-Is that right?

35:36.884 --> 35:38.386
-They're tearing the old building down?
-Yeah.

35:38.719 --> 35:39.762
From what I've been hearing.

35:39.846 --> 35:42.640
Jeez, 'cause this building
came through the fire like a champ.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.392
I mean, they don't build 'em
like this anymore.

35:44.475 --> 35:47.103
Well, who actually said
that the building is coming down?

35:47.186 --> 35:50.022
I thought Lieutenant Hunter said that
they were gonna level the whole place.

35:50.773 --> 35:53.317
I don't know,
I guess he's just saying his own opinion.

35:53.401 --> 35:56.320
Gentlemen, ladies,
let's understand each other.

35:56.404 --> 35:59.824
Given the budget crunch,
if old is sound, then old is better.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.951
But I repeat, it's not my department.

36:02.660 --> 36:06.247
Didn't you come here to get the story
on an historic and heroic arrest?

36:12.128 --> 36:13.963
-Norman.
-Lieutenant.

36:14.547 --> 36:15.506
I salute you.

36:17.466 --> 36:18.301
Thanks.

36:18.968 --> 36:22.388
Yes, I've been there,
<i>non carborundum,</i> and all that.

36:22.471 --> 36:23.764
How'd you get by, Howard?

36:23.848 --> 36:27.351
What, the humiliation and unjust emotion?

36:29.520 --> 36:32.857
I stood there, in front of everybody...

36:34.442 --> 36:36.861
in front of the judge, the cops...

36:38.529 --> 36:41.532
as if I was a thief. Or a pimp.

36:41.616 --> 36:42.783
Well, you're neither.

36:44.869 --> 36:45.828
You're a man.

36:46.913 --> 36:51.042
Naked, shivering,
everything in the world taken from you,

36:51.125 --> 36:52.126
you'd still be that.

36:54.003 --> 36:56.380
-You believe that?
-Oh, yes, I've had to.

36:59.675 --> 37:00.509
Norman...

37:01.761 --> 37:05.640
people like Daniels
don't give a rat's dropping

37:05.973 --> 37:07.683
about people like you and I.

37:20.279 --> 37:21.489
REPORTER: What about Lieutenant Buntz?

37:21.572 --> 37:22.406
What about him?

37:22.823 --> 37:26.077
As I jokingly suggested to his captain,
are we supposed to pin a medal on him?

37:26.452 --> 37:28.996
He, in fact, was a decorated cop,
am I right?

37:29.080 --> 37:31.457
FLETCHER: And his jacket's
as thick as the Yellow Pages.

37:31.832 --> 37:35.586
People, without prejudging anybody,
I'll say this once.

37:35.670 --> 37:38.798
The department is not afraid
to sort out its bad apples.

37:38.881 --> 37:41.550
REPORTER: You wouldn't be
going after Buntz to broaden the focus

37:41.634 --> 37:43.970
away from your busted
Internal Affairs man, would you?

37:44.053 --> 37:47.431
Absolutely not! Each will be dealt with.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.225
In Buntz's case, he carried a weapon

37:49.308 --> 37:51.269
and assaulted a man
while under suspension.

37:51.352 --> 37:52.853
Allegedly, of course.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.022
Please, people, on this day,

37:55.106 --> 37:57.858
when we should all be relieved and proud
that a vicious killer

37:57.942 --> 38:01.320
has been brought to ground,
let's not dwell on the department's

38:01.904 --> 38:04.573
thieving, bullying, greedy lawless few.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.659
You're saying I'm finished, aren't you?

38:07.410 --> 38:10.621
Sir, if I have anything
to say about it, you are.

38:11.539 --> 38:12.540
(grunts)

38:12.623 --> 38:14.583
(all exclaiming)

38:14.667 --> 38:19.672
(overlapping chatter)

38:20.214 --> 38:21.048
Mick?

38:25.136 --> 38:27.388
Hey, you tell me to make coffee
and then you disappear.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.348
Sorry. Philip asleep?

38:32.518 --> 38:34.228
-What is it?
-It's okay.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.606
I found the tax receipts
right where they were supposed to be.

38:38.858 --> 38:40.359
(crying, sniffles)

38:42.069 --> 38:43.821
She saved everything.

38:44.572 --> 38:45.698
Wrapping paper...

38:48.326 --> 38:49.952
Rubber bands, she saved.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.288
Keys to nothing.

38:55.291 --> 38:58.961
There's two boxes here...
full of actual rags.

39:00.212 --> 39:03.924
That used to drive me crazy,
that we had exploding closets.

39:04.383 --> 39:05.468
Pop didn't care.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.597
(crying)

39:10.306 --> 39:11.557
I could have done this.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.810
I could have gone through
this stuff for you.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.188
Don't you think this is
something for me to do?

39:17.271 --> 39:21.025
After all, this time, I could never
bring myself to get near this stuff.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.862
(sighs)

39:27.865 --> 39:31.452
The stuff that was Mom's,
the pictures and the letters...

39:32.620 --> 39:33.871
I put in one box.

39:33.954 --> 39:35.206
That's what we'll show to Philip

39:35.289 --> 39:37.625
when he's old enough
to know who his grandma was.

39:42.421 --> 39:43.881
The rest of this stuff...

39:45.341 --> 39:47.426
It's junk. It goes.

39:50.179 --> 39:51.013
What is it?

39:51.847 --> 39:52.973
It's a passbook.

39:53.057 --> 39:56.852
She opened up an account
nine years ago for her grandchildren.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.481
That's where all the money
I gave her wound up.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.066
That's Philip's now.

40:03.859 --> 40:04.902
She never said.

40:07.113 --> 40:09.115
And you know what? (laughs)

40:11.033 --> 40:12.785
She never declared the interest.

40:13.327 --> 40:15.788
I don't know what the hell
I'm gonna tell 'em down at the audit.

40:24.255 --> 40:28.592
Hi, um... I'm Officer Hill.
I was here before.

40:30.594 --> 40:33.931
I-I brought something for you.
For the little one.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.643
I got it at the fast food.

40:41.856 --> 40:44.984
Lionel? Look what the nice man
gave you, a clown cup.

40:45.067 --> 40:45.901
Hey--

40:48.237 --> 40:50.114
-He's shy.
-Yeah.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.869
I know who you are.
I remember from a long time ago.

40:54.952 --> 40:56.328
That's why I came back.

40:56.787 --> 40:59.123
I've been trying
to remember you, but I can't.

41:01.917 --> 41:03.043
You were Officer Friendly.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.254
Came to my school.

41:06.755 --> 41:08.174
I was at the academy.

41:08.924 --> 41:11.051
That was part of our training program.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.846
I was in the seventh grade.

41:15.389 --> 41:18.893
That was my last year,
I... didn't do no more school after that.

41:18.976 --> 41:23.981
Why didn't you just say to me today
that's where you knew me from?

41:25.149 --> 41:25.983
I guess...

41:27.568 --> 41:30.237
'cause everything
I take out and show just...

41:31.155 --> 41:32.448
just gets took from me.

41:34.783 --> 41:36.160
A lot's happened since then.

41:36.911 --> 41:37.745
Yeah.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.373
You were nice then, too.

41:41.457 --> 41:42.500
(chuckles)

41:45.044 --> 41:47.421
Look, have you and the kids
had dinner yet?

41:47.505 --> 41:48.464
'Cause I haven't.

41:48.547 --> 41:52.843
I was just thinking that maybe I could
just take you all out to the fast food.

41:57.890 --> 41:59.308
I'll go put some clothes on the baby.

41:59.725 --> 42:00.559
Okay.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.654
You know, the day we had,
dinner like that was just the thing.

42:11.737 --> 42:14.323
That was some beautiful meal
you ordered, Sal.

42:14.406 --> 42:15.241
It's no big deal.

42:15.783 --> 42:18.953
Couple of basic rules to remember,
what color of wine goes with what.

42:19.370 --> 42:22.998
No kidding, Sal, it was a real feast,
and you were such a gentleman.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.709
Life is full of surprises, huh?

42:27.211 --> 42:30.005
Yeah, sometimes you just
don't know about people,

42:30.089 --> 42:32.007
until you see 'em in the real world.

42:36.428 --> 42:38.847
I'll have you home by 11:00, as promised.

42:40.766 --> 42:41.642
Ladies first.

42:48.941 --> 42:51.986
-(loud clatter)
-Ah! Come on, come on.

42:52.570 --> 42:53.404
Okay...

43:06.458 --> 43:08.002
Hey, hey, all right.

43:08.877 --> 43:09.837
Okay, come on, Robert,

43:09.920 --> 43:12.840
let's see how much cash
you stashed in here.

43:12.923 --> 43:14.550
-(loud thumping)
-ROBERT: Ladies and gentlemen...

43:15.384 --> 43:16.760
this is actual history.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.639
The opening of Abe Calabrizzi's
secret wine cellar.

43:21.015 --> 43:25.603
After four decades, the spoils
of America's most notorious gangster.

43:29.565 --> 43:31.483
I am now crossing over the threshold.

43:32.985 --> 43:37.323
Like an archaeologist,
exploring the dawn of organized crime.

43:37.865 --> 43:38.949
What will I find?

43:39.575 --> 43:40.618
What-- what the hell--

43:42.161 --> 43:42.995
It's a corpse!

43:43.454 --> 43:45.247
Ladies and gentlemen,
could this have happened?

43:45.623 --> 43:51.545
Did we discover some final ghoulish entry
in the ledger of Abe Calabrizzi's victims?

43:51.629 --> 43:52.796
-What--
-Whoa! Hey!

43:56.967 --> 43:57.843
Where am I?

44:00.095 --> 44:01.555
It's-it's a miracle!

44:01.639 --> 44:04.308
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm beginning to smell a rat here.

44:04.808 --> 44:07.019
I'm beginning to smell a calculated effort

44:07.436 --> 44:11.357
by an envious power structure
to embarrass an investigative reporter.

44:11.440 --> 44:12.941
Who sent you, buddy,
who are you working for?

44:13.025 --> 44:13.859
Nobody.

44:14.693 --> 44:17.321
Hey, you can go with
envy as a power structure

44:17.404 --> 44:18.947
if you want to, Mr. DiNapoli.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.492
I'm sticking with "it's a miracle."

44:22.868 --> 44:23.869
Hi, sis!

44:25.037 --> 44:26.330
I'll apologize, you know.

44:26.413 --> 44:30.709
Believe me, Sid, a sincere apology,
there's no way Daniels doesn't reconsider.

44:30.793 --> 44:33.045
Hm. Take the shot.

44:36.298 --> 44:37.299
Kidding myself, aren't I?

44:39.468 --> 44:40.302
Well...

44:42.054 --> 44:44.473
chief of police,
you busted him in the chops.

44:48.185 --> 44:49.603
(sighs)

44:51.647 --> 44:52.564
I'm finished.

44:54.066 --> 44:54.900
I don't know.

44:56.235 --> 44:58.195
They're not filing any
criminal complaints, am I right?

44:59.405 --> 45:00.906
There's no charges for assault.

45:01.782 --> 45:02.616
No.

45:03.367 --> 45:06.078
They're making do with what they got
against me, carrying that piece.

45:07.371 --> 45:09.123
All right, so it's a misdemeanor beef.

45:10.165 --> 45:12.000
There's no way on the planet
you're looking at any time.

45:13.919 --> 45:15.838
-You don't get it, do you?
-What?

45:18.006 --> 45:20.217
(voice shaking) I, uh...

45:21.969 --> 45:23.011
can't be a cop.

45:25.139 --> 45:28.058
The rest... don't make any difference.

45:31.228 --> 45:32.354
Hey, Norm.

45:38.235 --> 45:39.069
Norman.

45:40.779 --> 45:41.655
You're a good guy.

45:42.531 --> 45:46.076
-SID: Cop or no cop. You understand?
-(sighs)

45:49.329 --> 45:50.164
What are you doing?

45:52.082 --> 45:53.667
(sighing) Oh, take a walk.

45:54.626 --> 45:56.879
Think about what I'm gonna do
with the rest of my life.

46:00.466 --> 46:02.301
-Company?
-No, Sid.

46:03.552 --> 46:05.846
Okay, then I'm gonna stay here
till you get back, though.

46:09.892 --> 46:11.018
Thanks.

46:13.061 --> 46:14.813
If you're going by a convenience...

46:17.775 --> 46:19.777
one of them orange flavor big pops?

46:22.321 --> 46:23.280
Yeah, if I remember.

46:23.697 --> 46:24.782
Only if it's on the way.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.034
All right.

46:36.460 --> 46:37.878
(phone ringing)

46:38.212 --> 46:39.213
Hello?

46:40.130 --> 46:41.048
Yes, Warren.

46:45.761 --> 46:47.304
Okay. I get the idea.

46:49.681 --> 46:50.516
Thanks for trying.

46:51.642 --> 46:52.476
Good night.

46:54.311 --> 46:55.145
Buntz is out.

46:58.273 --> 47:00.400
Couldn't keep the punch
out of the papers, hm?

47:00.776 --> 47:01.610
Nope.

47:04.738 --> 47:06.532
Give it a month or two to settle down.

47:07.032 --> 47:09.201
It's not the kind of thing
Daniels forgets.

47:10.077 --> 47:11.870
You're feeling guilty as hell.

47:11.954 --> 47:14.122
It's all your fault,
because you can't save him.

47:15.624 --> 47:17.918
I'm sure he didn't expect you
to pull this out.

47:21.255 --> 47:22.339
Look on the plus side.

47:23.507 --> 47:25.092
Station's still standing,

47:26.385 --> 47:28.554
the prostitute killer's off the street...

47:31.098 --> 47:34.768
and somebody decked the chief.
I'd say was a break-even day.

47:44.069 --> 47:44.903
Hey, Norm.

47:46.071 --> 47:46.947
You believe that?

47:47.823 --> 47:50.993
With all the fire and everything else,
this old place is still sound.

47:51.702 --> 47:52.536
Yeah.

47:53.245 --> 47:54.079
Believe that.

47:54.454 --> 47:56.540
(phone ringing)

48:03.547 --> 48:04.381
Hill Street.

48:16.393 --> 48:19.396
(closing theme playing)
