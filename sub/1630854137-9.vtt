00:04.838 --> 00:05.213
.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.214
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:07.048 --> 00:08.383
sexually based offenses

00:08.425 --> 00:10.635
are considered
especially heinous.

00:10.677 --> 00:13.138
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:13.179 --> 00:14.931
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:14.973 --> 00:16.349
are members of an elite squad

00:16.391 --> 00:18.351
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.562
These are their stories.

00:21.479 --> 00:24.774
- Criminals don't obey laws
like the rest of us.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.276
- One of them impressed.

00:26.317 --> 00:27.902
They're gonna approach you
with a job offer.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.279
- I'm not a teacher.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.656
- Just sleep on it.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.284
- What are you doing?
[gunshot]

00:34.325 --> 00:35.910
- Where's Priya?
[gunshot]

00:35.952 --> 00:38.538
[tense music]

00:38.580 --> 00:41.041
- Priya?
- You're safe now.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.043
- Elias Olsen, NYPD.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.586
- Hey, stop!
- [grunts]

00:44.627 --> 00:46.504
- His lawyer is gonna salivate

00:46.546 --> 00:48.381
when he sees
that lump on his head.

00:48.423 --> 00:51.760
- You shot two people and
kidnapped a 15-year-old girl.

00:51.801 --> 00:54.137
- Is this the woman
who assaulted my client?

00:54.179 --> 00:56.181
- Elias's attorney
pled not guilty.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.557
- There's no do-overs in court.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.893
Make sure
that all your mistakes happen

00:59.934 --> 01:01.478
before you hit the stand.

01:03.229 --> 01:06.316
[alarm chiming]

01:10.236 --> 01:12.989
[both groaning]

01:13.031 --> 01:16.242
- Good morning.
- [chuckles]

01:16.284 --> 01:18.411
What's on the docket today,
Counselor?

01:18.453 --> 01:21.206
- Oh, aside from Elias Olsen's
attorney torturing me

01:21.247 --> 01:24.376
with pretrial motions,
eh, not too much.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.670
- Elias,
he kidnapped Priya Singh

01:26.711 --> 01:28.421
and kept the woman locked
in a basement,

01:28.463 --> 01:29.839
and his lawyer
won't take a deal?

01:29.881 --> 01:31.174
- Carter's just doing his job.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.051
He's doing a good job.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.511
- You're too nice, Counselor.

01:34.552 --> 01:36.012
- Oh, I'm too nice?
- Mm-hmm.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.097
- I'm too nice?
- [chuckles]

01:37.138 --> 01:38.848
- Wake up!
Wake up!

01:38.890 --> 01:40.225
- Whoa!
- Oh.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.434
- Where's the fire?

01:41.476 --> 01:43.019
- It's 20 days till Christmas!

01:43.061 --> 01:45.105
- Christmas!
I almost forgot!

01:45.146 --> 01:47.148
[laughter]
Come here.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.652
- Noah, you have had your nose

01:50.694 --> 01:52.362
buried in that phone
all morning.

01:52.404 --> 01:53.863
Is that something for school?

01:53.905 --> 01:55.615
- A project, sort of.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.534
- Jorge,
when did this graffiti go up?

01:57.575 --> 01:58.743
- Must have been last night.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.496
Pain in the ass
to clean it off.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.206
- Mom, you all right?

02:03.248 --> 02:06.584
- Yeah, I'm fine.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.587
So what is the deal
with that phone?

02:09.629 --> 02:11.589
- It's a surprise
for Christmas.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.966
- OK.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.718
- My brother wants me
to go snowboarding with him

02:14.759 --> 02:16.344
over the holidays.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.680
I've already got days off.
And he bought my ticket.

02:18.722 --> 02:21.099
- So what's the problem?
- Elias Olsen.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.810
Carisi said the judge
could schedule a trial any day.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.396
- I mean, you clocked the guy
in the head with a radio.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.981
My guess is they're gonna
call you in as a witness.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.983
- Yeah, well, I'm already late
for prep with Carisi.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.609
- Called into
the principal's office, huh?

02:31.651 --> 02:33.528
- Look,
I've got nothing to hide, OK?

02:33.570 --> 02:35.613
The guy was running.
I was just doing my job.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.032
- Yeah, that's a great defense.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.908
You know,
juries love an angry cop.

02:38.950 --> 02:39.951
- [chuckles dryly]

02:47.292 --> 02:49.169
- Counselor.
- Your Honor.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.504
- You ready for this?
- I hope so.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.631
- Noah's a good kid, Liv.
- I know he is.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.550
It's just
he's been so secretive

02:55.592 --> 02:57.010
with his devices lately.
[phone buzzes]

02:57.052 --> 02:58.428
- What is he, 12?
- Yeah.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.847
- That sounds about right.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.140
- Uh-oh.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.559
Carisi wants us
at the courthouse immediately.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.394
- Something
with the Olsen trial?

03:06.436 --> 03:07.896
This can't be good.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.147
- Carter is definitely

03:09.189 --> 03:10.732
gonna bring up the radio,
but don't worry.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.400
We're gonna prep you
backwards and forwards.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.818
- But I am prepped,
all right?

03:13.860 --> 03:15.111
I've been thinking about this
for weeks.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.654
And by the way,
I've been on the witness list

03:16.696 --> 03:17.655
for a whole bunch
of gang cases.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.656
- Oh, yeah?
How many times

03:18.698 --> 03:20.658
have you been cross-examined?

03:20.700 --> 03:22.202
- We didn't get to that,
but look,

03:22.243 --> 03:24.454
I've been
on 500 Bumble dates, OK?

03:24.496 --> 03:26.206
All those questions,
how much different could it be?

03:26.247 --> 03:28.375
- Look, this guy, Carter,
on crosses,

03:28.416 --> 03:29.918
he is the king
of the food chain.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.587
And right now,
you are the weakest gazelle.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.298
Do you understand?
- No pressure.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.384
- OK, look.
I got to go.

03:37.425 --> 03:39.302
I'm due in court.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.553
- Hey, Counselor!

03:40.595 --> 03:42.305
- No, Muncy,
I got to go.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.727
- So where are we going?
- Arraignment court, part 42.

03:47.769 --> 03:51.773
- I hope
this isn't about Muncy's radio.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.191
- Hey! Hey!

03:53.233 --> 03:54.526
- Muncy,
we can finish prep later.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.444
- No, wait.
You dropped this.

03:57.946 --> 03:58.988
You OK?

03:59.030 --> 04:01.282
You're usually very slick.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.076
- [sighs]
I'm fine.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.703
- You're not worried
about Elias Olsen, are you?

04:04.744 --> 04:06.579
I'm the one taking the stand.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.166
- Judge.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.418
Hey, what's going on?

04:11.459 --> 04:12.919
- You're just in time.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.213
- For what?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.715
- Hey, everybody.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.925
Um...

04:18.967 --> 04:20.593
Thank you all for coming.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.512
- What's up, Carisi?

04:27.350 --> 04:29.060
Oh, wow.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.896
- Carisi and I were talking,

04:31.938 --> 04:35.775
and we realized that marriage
is a lot like a crime.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.738
You know, we have motive
and opportunity.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.656
- And...

04:41.698 --> 04:45.035
we figured that
all we needed were witnesses.

04:45.076 --> 04:49.080
- We don't want to do this
without any of you here.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.458
- You're gonna
start crying already, Liv?

04:51.499 --> 04:52.542
- [chuckles]
- Yes.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.713
- Counselor, are you ready

04:56.755 --> 05:00.008
to begin the longest
arrangement of your life?

05:00.050 --> 05:01.468
- I am.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.011
- Do you have the rings?

05:05.555 --> 05:06.681
- [chuckles]

05:09.017 --> 05:10.852
- OK, um...

05:10.894 --> 05:13.521
You get the big one, right?
- Yes.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.690
- Dearly beloved,

05:15.732 --> 05:19.444
we are gathered here today
in the presence of this company

05:19.486 --> 05:23.156
to join together this man
and this woman

05:23.198 --> 05:25.617
in holy matrimony.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.621
[cheering]
[glasses clinking]

05:29.662 --> 05:31.039
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

05:31.081 --> 05:34.000
[upbeat music]

05:34.042 --> 05:40.924
* *

05:42.050 --> 05:45.178
- Just married!
- That's your wifey!

05:45.220 --> 05:47.180
- Hey.
- To love.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.848
- If you say so.
[chuckles]

05:48.890 --> 05:52.519
- Aw, I'm so happy for you.
- Congrats, man.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.270
Does this mean
you get more than one drawer?

05:54.312 --> 05:55.772
- We're still negotiating.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.649
- I can't believe
that your mother is not here.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.110
- Oh, she's planning the
real wedding on Staten Island.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.195
- Just wanted to spare you
the ice sculptures.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.697
- Got it.

06:04.948 --> 06:08.201
- Mom! Mom!
- Yes? Yes, sweetie?

06:08.243 --> 06:09.285
- I got to tell you something.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.453
- What?
What is going on?

06:10.495 --> 06:12.205
- The Christmas surprise,
it's happening!

06:12.247 --> 06:13.456
Connor wants to meet me.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.041
- Who is Connor?

06:15.083 --> 06:17.252
- My big brother.

06:17.293 --> 06:24.259
* *

06:24.300 --> 06:27.262
[dramatic music]

06:27.303 --> 06:34.436
* *

07:14.476 --> 07:15.935
Noah found a brother?

07:15.977 --> 07:20.398
- A half-brother
from a genetic ancestry site.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.109
- So what did he do, just check
the box that said he was 18?

07:23.151 --> 07:25.612
- He used the gift card
that you gave him.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.739
- Oh, don't try
to put this on me.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.282
Did you know
he was talking to his brother?

07:29.324 --> 07:31.201
- He wanted it to be a surprise
for Christmas,

07:31.242 --> 07:32.952
but then he got so excited,
he couldn't wait.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.830
I mean, I don't think
that he was expecting

07:35.872 --> 07:37.248
to find a half-sibling.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.626
- I don't think
you were expecting that either.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.212
What do you know
about this brother?

07:44.047 --> 07:46.132
- Paternal match.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.760
- What?

07:48.802 --> 07:51.262
Johnny D had another kid?

07:51.304 --> 07:54.766
- His name is Connor.
He's 13 years old.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.560
He was adopted
from foster care

07:57.602 --> 08:00.939
a few years back
by Matt and Ginny McCann.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.524
- Who probably have no idea

08:02.565 --> 08:04.693
that the kid's father
was a psychopath.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.698
- They're not gonna find out,
from me anyway.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.241
- You're not going
to meet them?

08:11.282 --> 08:12.659
- Fin, Noah and Connor

08:12.701 --> 08:15.161
have been texting each other
nonstop.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.081
They're dying
to meet each other.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.666
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna do

08:19.708 --> 08:24.004
what any self-respecting parent
would do in this situation.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.881
I'm gonna ask you
to run a full background check

08:26.923 --> 08:29.259
on the entire family.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.885
And I need to know everything.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.013
- You know
there's another option.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.055
Just say no.

08:34.097 --> 08:37.100
- I can't do that.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.351
Noah thinks

08:38.393 --> 08:43.231
this is the greatest
Christmas present ever.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.239
- Another motion
for continuance, Mr. Carter?

08:51.281 --> 08:54.784
- We just received evidentiary
materials from Dutchess County

08:54.826 --> 08:56.619
that I need time to review
with my client.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.204
- Well, you've had
over two months.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.915
- Elias is having difficulties
on Rikers.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.585
Not sleeping,
suffering from CPTSD.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.878
- What about the victims,
Your Honor?

09:04.919 --> 09:06.546
The Singhs are suffering

09:06.588 --> 09:08.548
every day
that this trial is delayed.

09:08.590 --> 09:09.716
They just want to testify.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.384
They want to move on
with their lives.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.511
- My client can never move on.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.765
He has the mental maturity
of a 10-year-old child.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.183
He needs time to prepare.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.602
- Save your defense
for the trial, Mr. Carter.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.771
- If Elias is
in that much distress,

09:22.812 --> 09:24.939
I would reconsider
the DA's plea offer.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.107
- Plea?

09:26.149 --> 09:28.902
For what should be
a police brutality case?

09:28.943 --> 09:31.112
I'm just asking for
a few more weeks, Your Honor.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.073
- We are approaching
the holidays.

09:33.114 --> 09:36.159
And, Mr. Carisi,
didn't you just get married?

09:36.201 --> 09:37.410
- I did.

09:37.452 --> 09:38.745
- Congratulations, Counselor.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.914
- But the people are ready
to go to trial now.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.582
- Motion
for continuance denied.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.917
[gavel slams]

09:43.958 --> 09:45.919
- And you're going to trial
tomorrow?

09:45.960 --> 09:47.087
So much for our honeymoon.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.214
- Welcome to being married
to an ADA.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.007
- At least
you'll have Christmas off.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.259
- Don't jinx us.
- Ha.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.595
- Um, speaking of which,

09:55.637 --> 09:59.349
have you thought about
what you're gonna tell Fordham?

09:59.391 --> 10:03.687
- I have thought about it.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.439
- You haven't talked
to Liv yet, have you?

10:06.481 --> 10:08.274
- Not yet.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.776
But I will.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.697
I will.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.615
- Thanks, Fin.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.450
- So when can we go
meet Connor?

10:17.492 --> 10:19.536
You got to meet your brother,
Uncle Simon.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.830
- Honey, it's complicated, OK?

10:21.871 --> 10:25.709
- Is this because
my father was a criminal?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.460
- Of course not, Noah.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.212
- Are you afraid
Connor might be?

10:29.254 --> 10:31.256
- No, sweetheart.
I'm not saying that.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.882
- Then why did you
have Fin check up on him?

10:32.924 --> 10:34.467
- Noah, listen to me.

10:34.509 --> 10:35.885
I just want to make sure

10:35.927 --> 10:38.888
that these people are
who they say they are, OK?

10:38.930 --> 10:41.433
I want to keep you safe.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.976
- Did you find anything?

10:43.018 --> 10:45.228
- Nothing.
They're clean.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.313
- Then I want
to meet my brother.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.398
- OK.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.650
- He's the only real family
I have.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.611
[tense music]

10:53.653 --> 10:56.656
* *

10:56.698 --> 10:57.866
Mom, this is beautiful.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.118
- I know.
It's so Christmassy, right?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.286
- Why don't we live up here?

11:01.327 --> 11:03.329
- Because my job
is in the city.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.206
- Does that mean
there's no bad guys up here?

11:05.248 --> 11:07.375
- Oh, trust me.
There are.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.049
- Is this it?

11:14.090 --> 11:17.302
- This is it.
It says 92 Hillcrest Avenue.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.012
- Let's go!
- Hold on, sweetie.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.847
Listen, I just want you
to remember that,

11:20.889 --> 11:22.766
you know,
not everything in life

11:22.807 --> 11:26.102
turns out the way you think
or the way you hope it might.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.396
- I know, I know.
Come on. Let's go.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.983
[knocks at door]

11:32.025 --> 11:34.903
I bet they have a big backyard.
- Oh, I bet they do.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.200
- Noah?

11:40.241 --> 11:41.201
- That's me.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.911
- And you must be
Captain Benson.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.455
- I guess Noah told you.

11:45.497 --> 11:46.956
Please call me Olivia.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.709
- Come in.
Come in, please.

11:49.751 --> 11:50.919
- Please.
- Thank you.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.631
- Noah, we're so excited
to meet you.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.049
Come on in.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.595
Is a hug OK?

12:00.637 --> 12:03.306
- Uh, yeah, sure.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.852
- Connor, come meet
your little brother.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.776
- Hi.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.611
- Hi.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.488
- I have a PlayStation 5.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.115
- I know.
You told me.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.075
- Do you play
"Red Dead Redemption"?

12:22.117 --> 12:25.912
- No, but you can teach me.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.000
[chuckles]

12:42.929 --> 12:43.138
.

12:43.179 --> 12:43.763
- That was delicious.

12:44.556 --> 12:45.390
- Ginny's meatloaf.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.642
Nothing better.
[laughter]

12:47.684 --> 12:49.936
- Who would like dessert? Boys?

12:49.978 --> 12:51.771
- Can I show Noah
my PlayStation 5 first?

12:51.813 --> 12:53.565
- Oh.
[chuckles nervously]

12:53.606 --> 12:55.608
Um, where is it?

12:55.650 --> 12:57.569
- In my room.
- Oh.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.612
Well, honey, why don't you
just stay here with us?

12:59.654 --> 13:02.365
- Mom, he's my brother.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.950
- Why don't you
keep the door open?

13:03.992 --> 13:05.285
OK, Connor?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.165
Your son is so well-behaved.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.792
- Oh, thank you.
Yours too.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.169
- Apple pie?

13:14.210 --> 13:15.795
- You know, actually,
we should be going.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.547
- Oh, well, it's à la mode.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.507
- [chuckles]
- Matt's homemade ice cream.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.550
- Wow, OK.

13:20.592 --> 13:23.511
Well, I guess
I can't say no then.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.180
Oh, that pie.

13:25.221 --> 13:28.308
Wow!
- Baking is kind of a passion.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.310
- Honey, Olivia's a guest.
- I don't mind.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.145
I really don't.
Let me help.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.480
- You guys, I got this.
You shoo.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.148
- Why don't we go sit
by the fire?

13:35.190 --> 13:38.735
- OK. Well, thank you so much
for having us.

13:38.777 --> 13:39.986
- We're thrilled you're here.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.988
Connor's been talking nonstop
about Noah.

13:42.030 --> 13:45.158
- Well, it must have been,

13:45.200 --> 13:48.244
you know, quite a shock
finding out that--

13:48.286 --> 13:50.830
that Connor had a half-brother.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.707
- It was.
And for you too.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.000
- Yes, well...

13:54.042 --> 13:55.835
- That's the beauty
of adoption, right?

13:55.877 --> 13:57.295
You get to choose your family.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.839
We just hope the boys can
keep building a relationship.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.258
- If I could ask,

14:02.300 --> 14:05.303
what do you know
about Connor's birth parents?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.180
- Well, the adoption agency
put us in touch

14:07.222 --> 14:08.223
with the birth mother.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.183
- Mm-hmm.
- She was young.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.227
Seemed like drugs
were an issue.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.521
She didn't talk
about the birth father.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.481
Seemed pretty tight-lipped
about it.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.693
I'm not even sure
she knew who it was.

14:19.734 --> 14:22.404
- Are you still in touch?

14:22.445 --> 14:24.155
- She ghosted us.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.366
Her cell was disconnected.

14:26.408 --> 14:29.786
I thought about hiring
a private investigator.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.246
- Right.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.374
- Oh, I hope this isn't, um,

14:34.416 --> 14:36.334
what do they call it,
oversharing?

14:36.376 --> 14:37.752
- Oh, no.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.463
No, no.
Not at all.

14:40.505 --> 14:44.384
That must have been difficult
for Connor.

14:44.426 --> 14:47.303
- Yeah,
so when he found Noah,

14:47.345 --> 14:50.098
it was like a lifeline for him.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.475
- Here we go.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.060
Just a little slice
for us ladies?

14:54.102 --> 14:55.478
- Oh, that looks amazing.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.689
- Connor, Noah,
pie and ice cream!

14:57.731 --> 14:58.648
- Thank you.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.402
- Here we go, boys.
- Mom, Mom!

15:02.444 --> 15:03.528
Connor asked me
to spend the night.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.571
Is that OK?

15:04.612 --> 15:06.740
- Oh, Noah, sweetheart,
you know--

15:06.781 --> 15:08.199
- We would love that.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.285
And, you know,
we have a guest room, Olivia.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.871
- You're so nice.
We already booked a motel.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.415
- But I can stay, right?

15:15.457 --> 15:17.459
Please?

15:17.500 --> 15:18.626
- Uh...

15:18.668 --> 15:21.588
[pensive music]

15:21.629 --> 15:28.595
* *

15:42.776 --> 15:44.611
- Ice machine's around back.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.446
I put some extra towels
in your room for you.

15:46.488 --> 15:48.740
- Great. Thank you...
- Troy.

15:48.782 --> 15:49.949
No minibar,
but if you want,

15:49.991 --> 15:51.743
I can make a run
to the liquor store for you.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.995
- Yeah, I'm good, Troy.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.290
I'm good.
Good night.

16:11.262 --> 16:14.182
[tense music]

16:14.224 --> 16:21.356
* *

16:29.030 --> 16:30.490
Oh, my God.

16:36.871 --> 16:39.290
Oh, my God.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.668
[phone buzzing]

16:45.714 --> 16:46.589
Rollins.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.676
Hey, can I call you right back?

16:49.718 --> 16:50.635
OK.

16:58.351 --> 17:02.105
Hey, sorry about that.

17:02.147 --> 17:04.524
Why are you calling me anyway?

17:04.566 --> 17:07.360
Shouldn't you be
enjoying married life?

17:07.402 --> 17:10.697
- Not yet. Elias Olsen's trial
starts tomorrow.

17:10.739 --> 17:12.532
- Oh, I'm sorry.

17:12.574 --> 17:16.077
- The stuff Carisi's had
to put up with, we're even.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.204
Hey, do you have a sec?
Are you alone?

17:18.246 --> 17:19.581
- I am alone.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.542
And you are not going
to believe this.

17:22.584 --> 17:26.379
I just found a hidden camera
in my motel room.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.173
- What?
Are you kidding?

17:28.214 --> 17:29.758
- I wish I was.

17:29.799 --> 17:33.261
It was behind the mirror
facing the bed.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.221
- Any suspects?

17:35.263 --> 17:36.806
- Well, I did get
a pretty pervy vibe

17:36.848 --> 17:38.016
from the desk clerk.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.726
- [scoffs]
So what's the plan?

17:39.768 --> 17:40.810
Go to the local precinct?

17:40.852 --> 17:42.896
- Well, it depends
how bored I get.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.939
- Hmm.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.399
How about I drive up?

17:46.441 --> 17:47.859
- No, no, you don't need to.
That--

17:47.901 --> 17:49.819
- No, but I can.
The girls are at my mother's.

17:49.861 --> 17:52.739
I probably won't see Carisi
for a week.

17:52.781 --> 17:57.410
- Well, uh, Noah is having
a sleepover at the McCanns'.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.287
He doesn't want
to spend time with me.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.413
- How's that going?

18:00.455 --> 18:03.333
- Well,
he's absolutely thrilled.

18:04.793 --> 18:05.919
- You, not so much?

18:05.960 --> 18:09.381
- Like, these people,
they are so sweet.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.841
They're like candy,
you know?

18:11.883 --> 18:14.094
I'm just waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.762
- Well, it's settled then.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.555
I'm gonna drive up
tomorrow morning.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.890
- OK, all right.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.851
But if you change your mind,
it's completely OK.

18:21.893 --> 18:24.771
Hey, why did you call?
What did you want to tell me?

18:24.813 --> 18:26.815
- Uh, nothing. Why?

18:26.856 --> 18:28.942
- Well, because you asked
if I was alone.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.485
- Oh.

18:30.527 --> 18:33.196
Yeah, it can--it can wait
till we're in person.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.489
- All right, bye.

18:34.531 --> 18:35.490
- Bye.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.412
- Mom.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.996
Matt taught me
how to throw a football.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.958
- He did, did he?
- Watch me, Mom!

18:45.000 --> 18:46.209
- I'm watching.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.420
- Go long!

18:48.461 --> 18:51.214
- I caught it!
- Wow, good one!

18:51.256 --> 18:53.216
- You raised
such a happy-go-lucky kid.

18:53.258 --> 18:54.801
- Yeah, the boys had
a great time last night.

18:54.843 --> 18:57.429
- Oh, I'm so glad.
- Yeah, we loved having him.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.597
I'm just sorry
you guys have to leave so soon.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.433
- Well, actually, about that--

19:01.474 --> 19:03.560
- Oh, you can stay longer?

19:03.601 --> 19:05.603
- Well, something
has come up in town

19:05.645 --> 19:08.023
that I need to take care of.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.900
- Huh.
A police matter?

19:10.942 --> 19:12.527
- Actually, it is.

19:12.569 --> 19:13.945
- You're a detective.

19:13.987 --> 19:14.988
- Well--

19:15.030 --> 19:16.948
- Captain, honey.

19:16.990 --> 19:20.744
- You have resources,
access to records.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.078
- I do.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.999
- Well, we're happy
to keep Noah another night,

19:26.041 --> 19:27.292
but...

19:27.334 --> 19:29.794
- There's something
we have to ask you.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.384
- You clean up nice.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.178
- Don't sound so shocked.

19:38.219 --> 19:41.097
- Hey, it'll be at least an
hour before I have to call you,

19:41.139 --> 19:42.849
so you can wait in
the witness room if you want.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.142
- OK, I'll wait there.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.435
No pissed-off face.

19:45.477 --> 19:46.853
- She's joking.

19:46.895 --> 19:48.521
[elevator dings]

19:50.398 --> 19:52.317
- All right.
I'll see you in court.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.572
Hi.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.366
- Well, this just got real.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.201
- Just stay in the zone.

20:01.242 --> 20:04.496
- See, that's why I brought
my emotional support animal.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.168
- I understand
that you want to know

20:10.210 --> 20:13.088
about Connor's birth father,
but, you know, I just--

20:13.129 --> 20:17.300
I want to warn you that
it's not a Christmas story.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.677
- We can handle this.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.304
- Yeah, we just want the truth.
- Yeah.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.390
- We met Connor's birth mother.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.267
I know it's not a happy story.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.811
- Well...

20:27.852 --> 20:30.605
[phone buzzing]
Um, I'm sorry.

20:33.692 --> 20:35.485
Oh, I'm so--
I'm so sorry.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.070
This is one of my detectives.

20:37.112 --> 20:38.738
I--I have to go.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.281
Hey, Amanda.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.492
So there's no visible wires.

20:42.534 --> 20:44.244
- It's probably Wi-Fi
or cell signal.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.745
No mic, no sound.

20:45.787 --> 20:47.872
- We need to figure out
who's picking up the signal.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.874
- You know, that desk clerk
you mentioned earlier,

20:49.916 --> 20:51.209
he's the one
on duty right now?

20:51.251 --> 20:52.877
The one that tried to hit on me
when I walked in?

20:52.919 --> 20:55.338
- Oh, he's not exactly
a criminal mastermind.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.799
- Let's find out.

21:06.975 --> 21:07.934
- Ladies!

21:07.976 --> 21:09.227
- What you watching there,
Troy?

21:09.269 --> 21:10.603
- Can I help you?

21:10.645 --> 21:11.980
You can't come back here.

21:12.022 --> 21:14.399
- Actually, we can. NYPD.

21:17.402 --> 21:18.945
- Unbelievable.

21:18.987 --> 21:20.196
- I can explain.

21:20.238 --> 21:21.239
- Can you?

21:21.281 --> 21:22.741
- Stand up, Troy.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.826
Put your hands
behind your back.

21:31.583 --> 21:31.750
.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.709
- I heard a gunshot
from downstairs.

21:33.877 --> 21:35.795
I was about to exit the shower

21:35.837 --> 21:39.591
when I saw Elias Olsen
standing in the doorway,

21:39.632 --> 21:41.301
aiming a gun at me.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.345
- Elias Olsen,
the defendant?

21:43.386 --> 21:44.721
- Yes.

21:44.763 --> 21:48.016
I grabbed my phone,
dialed 911.

21:48.058 --> 21:49.684
He said, "Where's Priya?"

21:49.726 --> 21:51.144
And then he shot me.

21:51.186 --> 21:52.896
It wasn't until later
at the hospital

21:52.937 --> 21:55.815
the detectives told me he had--

21:55.857 --> 21:57.567
he had kidnapped my daughter.

21:57.609 --> 21:58.985
- Thank you.

22:02.197 --> 22:03.490
- I'm very sorry

22:03.531 --> 22:05.408
for what your family
went through, Mrs. Singh.

22:05.450 --> 22:08.328
I just have a few questions.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.621
Is that OK?

22:11.873 --> 22:12.916
The man who shot you that night

22:12.957 --> 22:15.377
was wearing a welder's mask,
correct?

22:15.418 --> 22:16.628
- Yes.

22:16.670 --> 22:18.088
- Like this,

22:18.129 --> 22:21.508
completely covering his face,
including his eyes.

22:21.549 --> 22:22.801
- Yes.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.886
- So you never
actually saw who shot you.

22:26.638 --> 22:28.056
- No, but I--

22:28.098 --> 22:30.975
- But somehow you're sure
it was my client.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.143
- I--

22:32.185 --> 22:34.187
- Nothing further.

22:34.229 --> 22:35.355
- Redirect, Your Honor.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.941
Mrs. Singh,
I'll ask you again.

22:37.982 --> 22:41.152
How did you identify
Elias Olsen to the police?

22:41.194 --> 22:42.779
- I made a voice ID.

22:42.821 --> 22:44.989
- Thank you.
- And I am sure.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.866
My daughter told me it was him,
and so did the detectives.

22:46.908 --> 22:47.992
- Thank you, Mrs.--
- Before or after

22:48.034 --> 22:49.828
you made the ID?
- Your Honor.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.163
- Mr. Carter, sit down.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.791
- My apologies.

23:00.005 --> 23:02.632
- I swear,
I had nothing to do

23:02.674 --> 23:04.551
with installing
any of those cameras.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.594
- Any? That means
there's more than one.

23:06.636 --> 23:08.138
- My cousin, Ray,
he'll hurt me.

23:08.179 --> 23:10.098
He's got--
he's got anger issues.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.141
- So do we.

23:11.182 --> 23:13.685
- Where can we find him?

23:16.062 --> 23:19.482
- Hey, Fin notified 1PP that
we made an off-duty arrest.

23:19.524 --> 23:20.900
Does Woodstock PD
know these guys?

23:20.942 --> 23:23.028
- Well, they both have arrests
but no convictions.

23:23.069 --> 23:26.823
So Troy's cousin,
Ray Sprague,

23:26.865 --> 23:30.160
he has a relative
in the local DA's office.

23:30.201 --> 23:31.786
- OK, good,
so we question him,

23:31.828 --> 23:33.621
and he just lawyers up.
- Yeah.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.915
- And now what?

23:35.957 --> 23:39.085
- Well, we know
his favorite bar.

23:39.127 --> 23:41.296
What do you say
we make a night of it?

23:44.632 --> 23:46.718
- Elias Olsen threw me
into his trunk.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.346
It was dark.
We drove for a long time.

23:49.387 --> 23:50.722
- And what happened next?

23:50.764 --> 23:52.557
- When we stopped,
he took me out of his trunk.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.018
He brought me inside his house.
He locked me in the basement.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.061
- And then?

23:57.562 --> 23:59.647
- He told me the rules.

23:59.689 --> 24:02.233
"Good girls get good things.

24:02.275 --> 24:04.069
Bad girls get bad things."

24:04.110 --> 24:07.655
- Can you identify that man
for the jury, please?

24:07.697 --> 24:10.784
- The defendant,
Elias Olsen.

24:10.825 --> 24:12.702
He didn't have his mask on
when he locked me in.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.746
I saw his face very clearly.

24:14.788 --> 24:16.581
- Thank you.

24:18.083 --> 24:22.045
- It's easy to assume the worst
about strangers--

24:22.087 --> 24:26.174
the way they look,
their size.

24:26.216 --> 24:29.260
But I want to commend you
on your bravery, Ms. Singh.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.970
- Your Honor,
is there a question here?

24:31.012 --> 24:33.139
- I have no questions
for the young lady.

24:33.181 --> 24:35.892
- Mr. Carisi,
your next witness.

24:35.934 --> 24:38.436
- The people call
Detective Grace Muncy.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.896
- Any sign of Ray?

24:39.938 --> 24:42.565
- Bartender said that
he rolls in here around 5:00.

24:42.607 --> 24:44.693
And he's got
an outstanding tab.

24:44.734 --> 24:47.070
- Of course he does.
- So I put these on it.

24:47.112 --> 24:48.279
- [laughs]

24:48.321 --> 24:50.865
- The only cab that they had
came in a box.

24:50.907 --> 24:53.702
- OK, well, cheers.
- Cheers.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.870
- How are things going
on Candy Cane Lane?

24:55.912 --> 24:58.665
- Mm, the McCanns.

24:58.707 --> 25:02.168
Uh, great,
until they started grilling me

25:02.210 --> 25:06.381
about Noah's pimp
rapist birth father.

25:06.423 --> 25:07.841
- What did you tell them?

25:07.882 --> 25:09.718
- Nothing yet.

25:09.759 --> 25:12.345
You know, when I do,
I'll just tell them

25:12.387 --> 25:14.597
exactly what they could
find out on the Internet.

25:14.639 --> 25:16.725
- Right.
- Nothing more.

25:16.766 --> 25:20.812
- And how much does Noah?

25:20.854 --> 25:23.356
- You know,
not everything, obviously,

25:23.398 --> 25:25.984
not yet,
but look,

25:26.026 --> 25:27.819
I guess
I'm gonna have to tell him

25:27.861 --> 25:29.946
if there's any chance
that Connor finds out.

25:29.988 --> 25:31.990
- You know what?
He's a strong kid, Liv.

25:32.032 --> 25:33.533
He's got you in his corner,

25:33.575 --> 25:36.119
so he's gonna be able to handle
whatever comes his way.

25:36.161 --> 25:38.413
- I'm just not sure
that I will.

25:40.165 --> 25:43.460
- And on cue,
there's Ray.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.670
What now?

25:45.712 --> 25:48.006
- You ever had a threesome?

25:49.341 --> 25:50.842
- OK.

25:52.635 --> 25:53.803
- Thanks.

25:53.845 --> 25:55.430
- Hey there.
- Hi.

25:55.472 --> 25:56.598
- How's your night going?

25:56.639 --> 25:58.433
- Hello.
It just got a lot better.

25:58.475 --> 25:59.726
[laughter]

25:59.768 --> 26:01.144
- Well, we were wondering

26:01.186 --> 26:03.646
if you could settle a bet
for me and my girlfriend.

26:03.688 --> 26:05.357
- Oh, sure.
Whatever you want, babe.

26:05.398 --> 26:07.150
- How long do you think
it would take us

26:07.192 --> 26:10.737
to beat you at eight-ball?

26:10.779 --> 26:12.822
- Two on one.

26:12.864 --> 26:15.116
- OK. Well, what's in it
for me if I win?

26:15.158 --> 26:16.868
- Are you kidding me?
- [chuckles]

26:16.910 --> 26:18.870
- Are you gonna make my friend
repeat herself?

26:18.912 --> 26:21.873
- Two on one.

26:24.209 --> 26:27.379
- But first, how about you
buy us all another round?

26:27.420 --> 26:30.882
Whatever you're having,
make it a double.

26:33.551 --> 26:37.097
- We arrested Elias Olsen
as he was attempting to flee,

26:37.138 --> 26:40.392
and we recovered a gun on him
that was a ballistics match

26:40.433 --> 26:42.394
to the one he used
to shoot the Singhs.

26:42.435 --> 26:44.688
- Detective Muncy,
during the arrest,

26:44.729 --> 26:45.939
the defendant was injured.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.482
Can you explain that
to the jury, please?

26:47.524 --> 26:48.983
- Yes, he was running away.

26:49.025 --> 26:51.027
So I threw my radio.
It hit him in the head.

26:51.069 --> 26:52.779
We subdued him,
took him to the hospital,

26:52.821 --> 26:54.364
after which
we interrogated him.

26:54.406 --> 26:56.950
- What did the defendant tell
you during that interrogation?

26:56.991 --> 26:58.034
- That he was OK.

26:58.076 --> 26:59.369
- What did you take that
to mean?

26:59.411 --> 27:01.621
- That he didn't seem
to be fazed by the injury.

27:01.663 --> 27:04.040
- Objection.
Speculation.

27:04.082 --> 27:06.292
Unless Detective Muncy
can tell the jurors

27:06.334 --> 27:08.753
which medical school
she attended.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.006
- Withdrawn.
Nothing further.

27:13.717 --> 27:15.760
- Nice to see you again,
Detective Muncy.

27:15.802 --> 27:18.513
And this is nothing personal.
You know I'm just doing my job.

27:18.555 --> 27:19.931
- I'm waiting on the question
here, Your Honor.

27:19.973 --> 27:21.307
- Getting to it.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.268
Detective, you claim
you threw a radio

27:23.309 --> 27:25.395
at my client's head
to keep him from fleeing.

27:25.437 --> 27:26.896
- That's right.
- I'm confused.

27:26.938 --> 27:28.898
Weren't there also dozens
of police officers

27:28.940 --> 27:30.233
in the store with you?

27:30.275 --> 27:32.110
Not to mention the ones
in the parking lot.

27:32.152 --> 27:34.404
- Yes.
- In fact,

27:34.446 --> 27:36.906
the supermarket was surrounded,
wasn't it?

27:36.948 --> 27:38.491
An airship was called out.

27:38.533 --> 27:40.660
- Yes, but the exigency
of the situation,

27:40.702 --> 27:43.038
along with the fact that
he was believed to be armed,

27:43.079 --> 27:45.165
required him
to be taken down.

27:45.206 --> 27:48.251
- Did that require my client
to be called names?

27:48.293 --> 27:50.211
In the police report,
it says

27:50.253 --> 27:53.506
you called him
"a sick bastard."

27:53.548 --> 27:55.425
Sounds like you already
thought he was guilty.

27:55.467 --> 27:56.676
- He was.

27:56.718 --> 27:59.262
- And just who appointed
you judge? Withdrawn.

27:59.304 --> 28:02.182
- I was trying to subdue
a dangerous suspect.

28:02.223 --> 28:04.768
- Oh, first,
you're a medical doctor.

28:04.809 --> 28:06.227
Then you're a judge.

28:06.269 --> 28:08.646
Now you're an IAB captain.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.190
- I didn't do anything wrong.

28:10.231 --> 28:12.525
And I wasn't disciplined
by IAB.

28:12.567 --> 28:14.277
- That's certainly reassuring.

28:14.319 --> 28:16.321
How many times
have you used force

28:16.363 --> 28:18.406
to make an arrest,
Detective Muncy?

28:18.448 --> 28:20.367
- If you're talking
about the BLM protest,

28:20.408 --> 28:22.744
that was a bogus lawsuit
from years ago.

28:22.786 --> 28:25.955
- Oh, actually, I'm talking
about a few weeks ago,

28:25.997 --> 28:29.751
wherein you followed a suspect,
Lukas Peeters,

28:29.793 --> 28:32.796
into a cellar despite the
protestations of your sergeant.

28:32.837 --> 28:34.089
- Well, he was hurt already.

28:34.130 --> 28:35.548
- The police report shows

28:35.590 --> 28:38.635
he sustained several
cracked ribs during the arrest.

28:38.677 --> 28:39.803
- Look, this isn't about me!

28:39.844 --> 28:41.262
This is about that sick bastard

28:41.304 --> 28:43.515
keeping women locked up
in his basement,

28:43.556 --> 28:46.351
forcibly raping them,
and then killing their babies!

28:46.393 --> 28:47.477
- Your Honor.

28:47.519 --> 28:49.145
- Detective Muncy,
do you need a break?

28:49.187 --> 28:50.438
- Yes, I would like to use it

28:50.480 --> 28:52.357
to have ten minutes alone
with that animal!

28:52.399 --> 28:54.150
- Your Honor, I need a moment
with my witness.

28:54.192 --> 28:56.111
- I'm not finished
with my cross.

28:56.152 --> 28:58.154
This is highly prejudicial.

28:58.196 --> 29:01.366
- Detective,
are you able to continue?

29:03.451 --> 29:06.204
- Yes, Your Honor.
I'm sorry.

29:06.246 --> 29:08.206
- Detective's prior statement

29:08.248 --> 29:10.125
will be stricken
from the record.

29:10.166 --> 29:11.960
Jury will disregard.

29:12.002 --> 29:15.380
Mr. Carter, your witness.

29:21.428 --> 29:21.636
.

29:21.678 --> 29:22.679
- Are we here yet?
- Yeah, we're here.

29:24.014 --> 29:25.598
- All right, you got this, OK?
- Come on.

29:25.640 --> 29:26.891
- Just a few steps here.

29:26.933 --> 29:30.020
- Yeah, I got this, all right.
- Yeah, you do.

29:30.061 --> 29:32.856
OK, all right.
Let's get inside.

29:32.897 --> 29:34.232
Get more comfortable, huh?

29:34.274 --> 29:36.401
- All right.
I like the way you think.

29:36.443 --> 29:38.778
[laughter]

29:38.820 --> 29:41.781
[soft rock music]

29:41.823 --> 29:48.955

29:49.330 --> 29:51.458
- How did you find me?
- We're detectives.

29:51.499 --> 29:52.792
- Yeah, well,
you're not shrinks,

29:52.834 --> 29:54.794
and I don't really
want company right now.

29:54.836 --> 29:59.466
- OK, well, we're just gonna
be drinking over here then.

29:59.507 --> 30:01.468
That lawyer
really riled you up, huh?

30:01.509 --> 30:04.137
- Yeah, I screwed up this case.

30:04.179 --> 30:05.472
How pissed is Carisi?

30:05.513 --> 30:06.806
- On a scale from one to ten...

30:06.848 --> 30:09.267
- I'd say Vladimir Putin.

30:09.309 --> 30:11.436
- Well, my career is over.

30:11.478 --> 30:12.896
- Think you're the first cop

30:12.937 --> 30:15.732
to let some white-shoe suit
get under their skin?

30:15.774 --> 30:17.359
This has been a lesson.

30:17.400 --> 30:20.570
You just got to figure out how
to never let it happen again.

30:20.612 --> 30:22.489
- Drinking alone,

30:22.530 --> 30:25.075
feeling sorry for yourself
ain't the way.

30:25.116 --> 30:27.619
- Listen to this man.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.663
- So are you gonna let us
sit with you now?

30:35.126 --> 30:37.128
[laughter]

30:37.170 --> 30:39.923
- Ladies, let's get
this party started, huh?

30:39.964 --> 30:41.508
- That's on you, honey.
- Yeah.

30:41.549 --> 30:43.510
- Well, you know, ladies first.

30:43.551 --> 30:45.136
- Oh, of course.
- Ladies first.

30:45.178 --> 30:47.847
Fair is fair.

30:47.889 --> 30:52.310
- Well, you know, I think
that it's time to get serious.

30:52.352 --> 30:55.480
- Right, Ray?
- Should we get serious, Ray?

30:55.522 --> 30:58.233
- I like that.
Let's get serious.

31:01.569 --> 31:04.030
I was thinking

31:04.072 --> 31:06.241
maybe we should
slow this down...

31:06.282 --> 31:07.867
- What's the matter, Ray?

31:07.909 --> 31:09.994
- To savor the moment?

31:10.036 --> 31:12.288
- Are you gun shy?
- Me?

31:12.330 --> 31:14.457
- Or are you camera shy?

31:19.254 --> 31:20.922
- How do you know
about the camera?

31:20.964 --> 31:22.340
- No, the question, Ray, is,

31:22.382 --> 31:25.510
how did you know
about the camera?

31:27.470 --> 31:30.223
- Impressive work, Captain.
Thank you.

31:30.265 --> 31:32.517
Turns out
these guys were posting

31:32.559 --> 31:36.479
the amateur homemade porn they
were filming here on SugarFap,

31:36.521 --> 31:38.398
making over 10 grand a month.

31:38.440 --> 31:40.025
- So you can
tack on federal charges too.

31:40.066 --> 31:41.693
- Should we put him away
for a few years.

31:41.735 --> 31:43.611
- Oh, Captain,
I should let you know,

31:43.653 --> 31:47.574
we recovered some footage
of you in a state of undress.

31:47.615 --> 31:48.700
But don't worry.

31:48.742 --> 31:50.452
We'll scrub it
before it goes to the DA.

31:50.493 --> 31:53.538
- If it will help convict,

31:53.580 --> 31:56.291
tell them
that they should use it.

32:00.128 --> 32:02.088
- Are you sure about that?

32:02.130 --> 32:05.925
- You know, we ask rape victims
to reveal everything.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.886
- Mm.

32:07.927 --> 32:10.889
- Why should I be exempt?

32:10.930 --> 32:14.476
First of all, who knew
boxed wine is not so bad?

32:14.517 --> 32:18.396
- After three glasses,
who can tell the difference?

32:18.438 --> 32:20.273
- Here's to you, Amanda.

32:20.315 --> 32:22.525
Mrs. Carisi.
- [gasps]

32:22.567 --> 32:23.860
- Are you gonna
change your name?

32:23.902 --> 32:25.987
- Maybe.
Maybe I am.

32:26.029 --> 32:30.408
- Can I tell you how nice
it is to see you happy?

32:30.450 --> 32:33.536
- It's so nice to allow myself.

32:33.578 --> 32:36.081
When are you gonna do the same?

32:36.122 --> 32:37.374
- With who?

32:38.958 --> 32:41.294
- Stabler.

32:41.336 --> 32:42.587
Remember how I used to joke

32:42.629 --> 32:44.798
about you two
being in a motel room?

32:44.839 --> 32:46.508
And now here we are.

32:50.178 --> 32:53.223
- I did...

32:53.264 --> 32:57.852
feel like Stabler was my home.

32:59.688 --> 33:03.858
But he left me, Amanda,
and I'm--

33:03.900 --> 33:06.194
I'm not over it.

33:06.236 --> 33:10.240
And the thing is,
is that...

33:10.281 --> 33:14.661
I didn't have a right
or a claim.

33:14.703 --> 33:16.830
He's somebody else's husband.

33:16.871 --> 33:18.790
- He was your partner.

33:18.832 --> 33:21.918
- Yeah,
and I know this sounds crazy,

33:21.960 --> 33:26.339
but sometimes I think it--

33:26.381 --> 33:28.341
it would almost be easier...

33:28.383 --> 33:30.385
- If Kathy hadn't died.

33:32.053 --> 33:34.806
She was the boundary.

33:34.848 --> 33:36.224
- And with her gone,

33:36.266 --> 33:38.476
it's like there's nothing
but possibility,

33:38.518 --> 33:41.521
which is paralyzing.

33:41.563 --> 33:44.524
- If things didn't go well,

33:44.566 --> 33:47.318
so much to lose--
a whole friendship.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.070
- That is why

33:49.112 --> 33:52.782
I am so grateful for you.

33:52.824 --> 33:56.327
- Hmm, you did not feel that
way when I first came to SVU.

33:56.369 --> 33:58.496
- But you were
a different person back then.

33:58.538 --> 34:00.749
You were icy.
I mean, not icy-icy.

34:00.790 --> 34:02.459
But you wouldn't let me in.
- Ow.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.836
- And now,
you let me into everything.

34:07.088 --> 34:09.049
- And now...

34:09.090 --> 34:11.343
I might be leaving too.

34:11.384 --> 34:13.803
- That's funny.

34:19.434 --> 34:22.687
- I mean, there's a--
there's a job offer.

34:25.523 --> 34:27.442
To teach at Fordham.

34:29.277 --> 34:31.154
- And you're gonna take it?

34:31.196 --> 34:35.033
- I wanna say you taught me
how to be a good detective.

34:35.075 --> 34:37.202
- Amanda, stop.
I didn't teach you anything.

34:37.243 --> 34:38.828
You were already
a good detective.

34:38.870 --> 34:40.914
- You taught me
how to love myself

34:40.955 --> 34:42.165
and how to let people in,

34:42.207 --> 34:46.336
like victims, and Carisi, you.

34:47.587 --> 34:49.089
And this is hard for me.

34:49.130 --> 34:51.424
- It's hard for you?

34:51.466 --> 34:54.886
- I made this choice.

34:54.928 --> 34:56.596
Liv, I need you
to be OK with it.

34:56.638 --> 34:58.431
- Well, Amanda,
I wasn't expecting this,

34:58.473 --> 35:01.351
so I'm gonna need a minute.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.857
Where are you going?

35:07.899 --> 35:08.858
- Um...

35:11.945 --> 35:13.488
To get ice.

35:15.615 --> 35:18.785
[tense music]

35:18.827 --> 35:25.750
* *

35:30.880 --> 35:31.089
.

35:31.131 --> 35:32.257
- I hope you enjoyed your stay,
Mrs. Benson,

35:33.633 --> 35:34.884
and we're comping your room
because of what happened.

35:34.926 --> 35:36.386
- The friend that I was with,
Amanda Rollins,

35:36.428 --> 35:37.554
is she still here?

35:37.595 --> 35:39.764
- Oh, she checked out.

35:41.349 --> 35:43.768
- OK. Thank you.
- Yeah.

35:45.603 --> 35:47.230
- I'm not angry,
Detective Muncy.

35:47.272 --> 35:48.982
- Well, you should be.
- Why are you here?

35:49.024 --> 35:50.150
Because you want me
to yell at you?

35:50.191 --> 35:51.401
- No, I want to fix this.

35:51.443 --> 35:52.694
Velasco said
he wants to testify.

35:52.736 --> 35:54.070
- To what exactly?

35:54.112 --> 35:56.072
- That I was acting
within departmental protocol.

35:56.114 --> 35:58.199
When I threw the radio,
I wasn't using excessive force.

35:58.241 --> 35:59.743
- I'm not calling Velasco.
- OK, well, then call Fin.

35:59.784 --> 36:01.536
- Muncy, the trial's over.

36:01.578 --> 36:03.872
The defense rested.
No witnesses.

36:03.913 --> 36:06.249
They think that we have not
made beyond a reasonable doubt.

36:06.291 --> 36:08.543
- Do you?

36:08.585 --> 36:10.420
- We have a solid case,

36:10.462 --> 36:12.589
but I've seen solid cases melt
in front of my eyes before.

36:12.630 --> 36:15.300
It's with the jury now.

36:15.342 --> 36:20.096
So enjoy your day off because
we're not gonna need you.

36:20.138 --> 36:22.766
And, Muncy,

36:22.807 --> 36:24.934
the next time
you're on the stand,

36:24.976 --> 36:27.062
try to remember
that you don't know everything.

36:32.233 --> 36:34.694
- We heard about that craziness
at the motel.

36:34.736 --> 36:36.112
Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

36:36.154 --> 36:37.614
- I hope it doesn't give you
a negative impression

36:37.655 --> 36:38.990
of our town.

36:39.032 --> 36:40.784
We would love
for you and Noah to come back.

36:40.825 --> 36:43.119
- We would love that as well.

36:43.161 --> 36:44.954
So the boys?

36:44.996 --> 36:46.081
- They're in the backyard.
I'll go get them.

36:46.122 --> 36:47.707
- OK. You know,
before you go,

36:47.749 --> 36:50.835
if you want to hear
about Connor's birth father,

36:50.877 --> 36:54.631
I will tell you everything
that I know, just not now.

36:54.673 --> 36:56.091
You can call me.

36:56.132 --> 36:58.843
- We appreciate that,
but we decided

36:58.885 --> 37:01.346
it would be better
to leave things as they are.

37:01.388 --> 37:06.226
- If Connor asks when
he's older, we'll call you.

37:06.267 --> 37:09.813
- I completely understand.

37:09.854 --> 37:11.272
OK.

37:11.314 --> 37:14.609
And thank you
for taking care of my son.

37:14.651 --> 37:16.236
- We're family now.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.029
- Connor! Noah!

37:20.240 --> 37:21.616
- Mom!
- Hey.

37:21.658 --> 37:23.159
You ready to hit the road?

37:23.201 --> 37:25.662
- They gave me a present.

37:25.704 --> 37:27.330
A PlayStation 5.

37:27.372 --> 37:30.208
This way, we can play together.
- Oh, my gosh.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.002
That's so nice
but so unnecessary.

37:32.043 --> 37:33.795
- We got something for you too.

37:33.837 --> 37:35.213
Connor, go get it.

37:40.260 --> 37:41.678
- Merry Christmas.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.556
- Merry Christmas.

37:44.597 --> 37:46.891
- You don't have
to open it now.

37:46.933 --> 37:48.560
- Oh.

37:48.601 --> 37:50.603
Thank you.

37:53.189 --> 37:54.482
- So you told Liv.

37:54.524 --> 37:57.027
How'd it go?

37:57.068 --> 37:58.278
- Not great.

37:58.319 --> 37:59.612
- I'm sorry.

37:59.654 --> 38:02.115
She'll come around.
- Yeah.

38:02.157 --> 38:06.036
- But you are taking
the Fordham job?

38:08.538 --> 38:11.207
- I am. I am.

38:11.249 --> 38:13.043
- Congratulations.

38:13.084 --> 38:15.962
My wife, the professor.
- Yeah.

38:16.004 --> 38:17.630
- It's got a nice ring to it.
- [chuckles]

38:17.672 --> 38:18.882
[knocks at door]

38:18.923 --> 38:21.051
- Carisi, jury's back.

38:22.927 --> 38:24.804
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

38:28.808 --> 38:30.727
- A hung jury?

38:30.769 --> 38:32.020
Judge declared a mistrial?

38:32.062 --> 38:34.689
- Yeah, Carisi says
he's gonna retry.

38:34.731 --> 38:37.692
And don't go too hard
on Muncy, OK?

38:37.734 --> 38:38.943
- Why would I?

38:38.985 --> 38:40.904
- I'll let her explain.

38:40.945 --> 38:42.947
- That doesn't sound good.

38:47.285 --> 38:48.578
Hey, Amanda.
It's me.

38:48.620 --> 38:51.664
Please, please,
please call me back, OK?

38:53.375 --> 38:56.461
- Hey.
- Oh.

38:56.503 --> 38:59.589
- I'm sorry I left like that.

38:59.631 --> 39:02.467
- I completely understand.

39:02.509 --> 39:04.427
Amanda, I wanted to tell you--

39:04.469 --> 39:06.096
- You had a right to be upset.

39:06.137 --> 39:08.848
- I'm really sorry
that I reacted like that.

39:08.890 --> 39:11.601
You were being open with me,
and I--

39:11.643 --> 39:13.978
I--I shut down.

39:15.647 --> 39:18.358
- You stole one of my moves.

39:20.694 --> 39:22.404
I'm gonna blame the boxed wine.

39:22.445 --> 39:24.614
- Good idea.

39:24.656 --> 39:26.241
- You're not losing me.

39:26.282 --> 39:28.702
- Well,
I won't see you every day.

39:28.743 --> 39:30.912
- But...

39:30.954 --> 39:33.623
we're friends, right?

39:33.665 --> 39:35.625
That's not gonna change.

39:35.667 --> 39:37.627
And I'm not gonna disappear.

39:37.669 --> 39:41.131
- I wouldn't let you
if you tried.

39:41.172 --> 39:45.093
Look, I know
that you have to do this.

39:45.135 --> 39:48.138
- I have to try.

39:48.179 --> 39:51.307
- And if you ever want
to come back...

39:51.349 --> 39:52.976
or not.

39:53.018 --> 39:55.228
OK, that's settled.

39:55.270 --> 39:58.565
So get the hell out
of my office.

39:58.606 --> 39:59.733
- [chuckles]

40:02.193 --> 40:05.113
[both sobbing]

40:10.076 --> 40:11.786
- Don't postpone joy.

40:11.828 --> 40:14.497
- Mm.

40:14.539 --> 40:16.207
You too.

40:17.709 --> 40:20.503
- I love you, Amanda.

40:20.545 --> 40:22.464
- I love you, Liv.

40:22.505 --> 40:24.215
[laughter]

40:24.257 --> 40:27.218

40:27.260 --> 40:34.184

[cheers and applause]

40:45.403 --> 40:52.410

40:52.452 --> 40:53.745
- That's what's up.

40:53.787 --> 40:55.914
I'm gonna miss you, boo.

40:59.334 --> 41:01.836
You'll be all right.
- [chuckles]

41:01.878 --> 41:04.130
Come here.

41:04.172 --> 41:07.092

41:12.180 --> 41:14.599
