WEBVTT

00:44.845 --> 00:45.885
Get off!

00:46.085 --> 00:46.925
Get off!

00:51.685 --> 00:53.565
And this term started so well.

01:19.125 --> 01:19.965
{\an8}Wow.

01:20.045 --> 01:23.165
{\an8}"In recognition
of her exemplary witchcraft..."

01:23.245 --> 01:26.045
"...in restoring the Founding Stone
to its rightful place..."

01:26.605 --> 01:28.125
"Mildred Hubble.

01:28.205 --> 01:30.045
{\an8}Daughter of a true witching family!"

01:30.125 --> 01:31.245
{\an8}Yes!

01:50.485 --> 01:52.685
<i> When our days of school</i>
<i>are over</i>

01:54.245 --> 01:57.725
<i> Let us think of them</i>

01:57.805 --> 01:59.365
<i>with</i>

01:59.445 --> 02:03.205
<i>pride!</i>

02:11.485 --> 02:12.605
Ten, Miss Drill.

02:26.845 --> 02:28.285
-Well met.
-Well met.

02:29.205 --> 02:31.325
You're on fire, Millie. Like a new witch.

02:31.405 --> 02:33.045
As long as it doesn't go to your head.

02:33.125 --> 02:35.245
Mildred Hubble.

02:35.725 --> 02:36.965
Eager to begin your first year

02:37.045 --> 02:40.685
as an official member
of a witching family, no doubt?

02:40.765 --> 02:43.285
-Very much so, Miss Hardbroom--
-Then you'll be pleased to take on

02:43.365 --> 02:44.845
an official witching duty.

02:45.445 --> 02:48.405
I'm appointing you lantern monitor.

02:49.005 --> 02:51.525
-Oh! Thank you, Miss Hardbroom--
-Which means

02:51.605 --> 02:54.565
lighting every lantern, every bedtime.

02:55.045 --> 02:59.005
It is only five miles in perimeter,
so you should be done...

02:59.085 --> 03:01.085
by midnight.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.005
It's not so bad.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.365
And up at five thirty.

03:09.005 --> 03:11.925
To put them out again.

03:16.205 --> 03:17.645
Miss Cackle! Well met.

03:17.725 --> 03:18.925
Well met, all of you.

03:20.445 --> 03:22.765
Miss Cackle has an announcement to
make.

03:25.165 --> 03:26.925
I am thrilled to say...

03:27.485 --> 03:30.645
that The Great Wizard
will be visiting us tomorrow.

03:30.725 --> 03:31.845
-Oh!
-Wow!

03:31.925 --> 03:33.805
He feels that after certain...

03:34.485 --> 03:35.685
recent events,

03:35.765 --> 03:37.405
that we might need a...

03:38.525 --> 03:40.045
boost of morale at Cackle's.

03:41.045 --> 03:43.965
That's why he has proposed
a flying contest.

03:44.725 --> 03:45.765
The rules are simple:

03:45.845 --> 03:48.165
one witch and one cat per stick.

03:48.245 --> 03:49.085
And...

03:50.125 --> 03:51.885
there is a very special prize.

03:59.485 --> 04:01.125
A wishing star.

04:01.205 --> 04:02.045
Want.

04:02.125 --> 04:03.045
A wishing star.

04:03.125 --> 04:06.045
The most highly-concentrated potion
in witchcraft.

04:06.125 --> 04:08.685
A one-time-only spell
that can do almost anything you want.

04:08.765 --> 04:10.805
Maud. I am a third year now,

04:10.885 --> 04:12.405
you don't have to explain everything.

04:12.485 --> 04:13.445
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

04:13.525 --> 04:17.245
As if Mildred Hubble
could win a broomstick contest.

04:17.845 --> 04:21.084
Unless she was using it to sweep up,
of course!

04:23.605 --> 04:26.524
At least Mildred hasn't broken
any Founding Stones lately, Ethel.

04:28.725 --> 04:31.965
I do not remember inviting conversation.

04:34.965 --> 04:37.085
Remember your breathing exercises, Ethel.

04:39.525 --> 04:41.605
Can I just say, I respect you.

04:42.165 --> 04:43.725
I should think so.

04:43.805 --> 04:47.565
It must be so hard returning to a school
where your family name is mud.

04:47.645 --> 04:50.685
What she means is, is Sybil okay?

04:51.485 --> 04:53.045
She's late, and Sybil's never late.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.245
Probably can't face coming back.

04:55.325 --> 04:59.325
What with the squelchy, swampy,
squishy state of our family name.

05:01.445 --> 05:03.965
But what happened last term
wasn't Sybil's fault.

05:04.045 --> 05:07.085
She'll have spent the whole summer
worrying that people think it is.

05:08.405 --> 05:09.965
Wait! Look.

05:10.805 --> 05:11.845
Uh!

05:11.925 --> 05:13.005
Woo!

05:13.085 --> 05:16.325
That can't be her.
Sybil's never flown that badly.

05:17.805 --> 05:19.645
Wee!

05:26.685 --> 05:28.925
Yes! Worst landing ever!

05:29.765 --> 05:31.125
Syb! What happened, are you...

05:33.325 --> 05:34.245
What?

05:36.805 --> 05:39.725
Is it me, or does she look like...

05:43.525 --> 05:46.285
Guess who passed her home studies
degree with flying colors?

05:46.365 --> 05:48.645
<i>Wow! That's fantastic, Mum!</i>

05:48.725 --> 05:50.445
<i>I said you'd pass, didn't I.</i>

05:50.525 --> 05:51.765
You're a brilliant artist.

05:51.845 --> 05:53.845
<i>Well, for now, I'm a brilliant artist</i>

05:53.925 --> 05:56.125
<i>with absolutely no idea</i>
<i>what I'm going to do with it.</i>

05:56.965 --> 05:57.965
Mum, are...

06:04.405 --> 06:07.325
Are you sure you're not sad
that you missed out on being a witch?

06:08.125 --> 06:10.285
<i>Love, I've told you</i>
<i>I don't know how many times.</i>

06:10.365 --> 06:13.525
<i>You know what I'm like with heights.</i>
<i>What am I going to do on a broomstick?</i>

06:14.165 --> 06:16.565
<i>But, you must wonder,</i>
<i>even just now and then.</i>

06:17.565 --> 06:18.525
<i>Oh!</i>

06:18.605 --> 06:20.245
<i>That will be my new watercolors.</i>

06:20.325 --> 06:23.645
<i>Hey, same day delivery,</i>
<i>now that's magic, eh?</i>

06:46.085 --> 06:46.965
Miss Cackle.

06:47.325 --> 06:50.125
I seem to recall that in previous years
girls knocked.

06:50.205 --> 06:53.205
I'm sorry, Miss Cackle,
but this is important.

06:54.245 --> 06:56.365
You know how you asked
if there was anything

06:56.445 --> 06:58.685
you could do to thank me
for saving the school?

07:00.085 --> 07:01.685
You need only ask, Mildred.

07:05.645 --> 07:07.525
Um... It's my mum.

07:08.285 --> 07:09.965
She just passed her art degree.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.605
Oh! Do pass on my congratulations.

07:12.685 --> 07:13.605
Thank you, Miss Cackle.

07:13.685 --> 07:15.005
But the thing is...

07:16.125 --> 07:18.005
I'm not sure her heart's in it now.

07:18.765 --> 07:20.925
So, I wondered...

07:21.845 --> 07:23.565
Could you please make my mum magical?

07:27.205 --> 07:31.005
"That is the one thing
I cannot do, Mildred."

07:31.085 --> 07:34.925
"Giving magic to non-magical people
is forbidden, Mildred."

07:35.245 --> 07:36.085
Why?

07:36.965 --> 07:39.165
Chestnut husks and acorn cases,

07:39.245 --> 07:41.445
mix them up and we change places.

07:44.445 --> 07:45.285
Hey!

07:45.365 --> 07:47.005
This stuff's good!

07:49.405 --> 07:51.565
My mum is from a witching family.

07:52.885 --> 07:54.845
It's only giving her
what's rightfully hers.

07:56.085 --> 07:57.325
What harm can it do?

08:03.965 --> 08:06.445
Chestnut husks and acorn cases,

08:06.525 --> 08:08.325
mix them up and we change places.

08:13.845 --> 08:16.845
It's not the sort of thing you can do
with an ordinary potion.

08:19.885 --> 08:24.045
Could I make my mum magic
if I had an extraordinary potion?

08:24.445 --> 08:27.725
The possibilities of a wishing star
are endless.

08:27.805 --> 08:30.845
There's almost no limit to the spells
you could do if you won it.

08:30.925 --> 08:33.164
Just imagine, your greatest wish
come true.

08:34.605 --> 08:35.645
Sybil?

08:37.804 --> 08:40.325
Why are you dressed as her?

08:40.965 --> 08:43.085
The one who is to blame for everything.

08:44.684 --> 08:46.445
I know this is hard for you to hear...

08:47.405 --> 08:50.285
but she's the type of witch I want to be.

08:51.645 --> 08:53.245
Mildred Hubble?

08:53.325 --> 08:56.725
I needed to reinvent myself.
Worst is the new best.

09:04.165 --> 09:06.925
What I'm saying is,
the sky's the limit.

09:07.725 --> 09:11.325
You could fix almost anything
with this one little potion.

09:11.405 --> 09:14.965
If you're not already entered into the
contest, I would seriously consider it.

09:39.805 --> 09:41.005
What are you doing?

09:41.485 --> 09:43.725
One broomstick slalom course.

09:44.445 --> 09:46.525
You're entering the flying contest?

09:49.005 --> 09:49.925
Hover.

09:56.325 --> 09:57.485
I'm a real witch now.

09:57.565 --> 09:59.085
How hard can it be to fly like one?

10:00.165 --> 10:01.325
Come on, Tabby.

10:08.565 --> 10:10.765
Focus, Tabby! Focus!

10:10.845 --> 10:12.285
Tabby!

10:15.925 --> 10:17.005
Ow!

10:25.165 --> 10:26.525
Thanks, Tabby.

10:26.885 --> 10:28.325
You know he's a nervous flyer.

10:31.565 --> 10:33.085
It's hard for him to go up at all.

10:33.765 --> 10:35.685
Superb work, Mildred Hubble.

10:35.765 --> 10:38.285
Your witching family must be so proud.

10:43.045 --> 10:44.925
I guess she's training
for the contest then.

10:45.005 --> 10:45.845
So?

10:46.885 --> 10:48.205
We have to train harder.

10:49.885 --> 10:51.725
We have to win that wishing star.

10:52.005 --> 10:53.645
Is that really fair on Tabby?

10:56.005 --> 10:57.565
I saved the whole school.

10:57.645 --> 10:59.245
I can win one little contest.

11:36.725 --> 11:38.525
Can't grant one wish.

11:40.245 --> 11:42.325
Can make me lantern monitor.

11:47.205 --> 11:49.045
Hello?

11:51.325 --> 11:53.005
Ethel, is this you being funny?

11:59.565 --> 12:00.525
Shh, it's okay.

12:02.165 --> 12:03.045
It's okay.

12:04.565 --> 12:06.525
Whatever you are,
I'm not going to hurt you.

12:09.085 --> 12:11.325
Oh, where did you come from?

12:11.405 --> 12:13.165
Come here.

12:23.085 --> 12:24.245
Don't worry,

12:24.325 --> 12:25.645
we'll get you something to eat.

12:27.085 --> 12:28.325
You can't stay though.

12:29.005 --> 12:30.645
Dogs aren't allowed
because of all the cats.

12:33.485 --> 12:35.005
Don't worry, Tabby.

12:35.085 --> 12:36.925
This little one isn't going to hurt you.

12:38.365 --> 12:39.605
Tabby!

12:40.365 --> 12:41.205
No!

12:41.765 --> 12:42.765
Tabby!

12:42.845 --> 12:45.485
He's just a lost little dog,

12:46.525 --> 12:48.085
he doesn't mean you any harm.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.045
See?

12:54.445 --> 12:56.765
You're the witch's familiar here, okay?

12:56.845 --> 12:58.485
I expect you to behave like one.

13:02.165 --> 13:03.405
No, dog!

13:03.925 --> 13:05.005
No!

13:23.325 --> 13:24.525
Here boy!

13:24.605 --> 13:25.565
Heel!

13:25.645 --> 13:26.965
Heel!

13:27.045 --> 13:28.045
Come back!

13:41.205 --> 13:42.165
What?

13:50.205 --> 13:51.885
That was amazing, little dog!

13:52.245 --> 13:53.405
Who taught you that?

13:54.445 --> 13:56.205
Come on, you must be a familiar.

13:56.805 --> 13:58.725
I promise I'll help you find your owner.

13:58.805 --> 13:59.965
Starting tomorrow...

14:01.005 --> 14:03.085
unless we started...

14:04.045 --> 14:06.285
after the flying contest.

14:15.445 --> 14:16.805
You're going to do what?

14:16.885 --> 14:19.445
I'm going to use Star in the contest,
instead of Tabby.

14:20.725 --> 14:21.685
Star?

14:21.765 --> 14:23.605
Oh, that's what I called him. Star.

14:23.685 --> 14:25.445
Because you're going to help me win one!

14:25.525 --> 14:26.645
Aren't you, Star?

14:27.285 --> 14:29.525
And how does Tabby feel about this?

14:30.525 --> 14:32.085
You said yourself he hates flying.

14:35.165 --> 14:37.525
And I'd say he hates being left out
even more.

14:40.085 --> 14:42.925
That dog might have an owner somewhere,
worried sick about him.

14:43.005 --> 14:44.965
Yeah, but it will take like a week
to find them anyway.

14:45.925 --> 14:46.805
What's the harm?

14:46.885 --> 14:50.165
Millie, the rules were very clear:
one girl, one cat.

14:50.245 --> 14:52.325
If I followed every rule,
I'd never have saved the Academy.

14:52.405 --> 14:53.645
That was for the greater good.

14:53.725 --> 14:54.765
So is this!

14:54.845 --> 14:56.085
For my mum.

14:56.165 --> 14:59.925
Miss Cackle told you it was forbidden
to give a non-magical person magic.

15:00.005 --> 15:00.885
Forbidden, Millie.

15:00.965 --> 15:03.125
My family gave up their magic
to help others.

15:03.765 --> 15:05.765
All I'm doing is asking for it back.

15:05.845 --> 15:07.045
Being from a witching family

15:07.125 --> 15:09.445
doesn't mean you can suddenly
do whatever you want.

15:09.525 --> 15:10.805
Cheating against your classmates

15:10.885 --> 15:12.285
to win a valuable prize?

15:12.845 --> 15:14.325
It's like something Ethel would do.

15:17.965 --> 15:19.125
Maud's right.

15:20.725 --> 15:21.885
So you two won't help me?

15:29.645 --> 15:30.525
Well then.

15:31.325 --> 15:32.525
We have lantern duty.

15:35.205 --> 15:36.125
Star.

15:40.805 --> 15:42.885
Woo-hoo!

15:43.405 --> 15:45.245
Woo-hoo!

15:46.765 --> 15:48.325
You're brilliant at this!

15:48.645 --> 15:51.325
The wishing star is ours!

15:59.205 --> 16:03.405
Since when can Mildred Hubble
and her useless cat fly like that?

16:12.205 --> 16:14.165
Ten past.

16:14.725 --> 16:19.165
Not so much the Great Wizard
as the Late Wizard.

16:23.085 --> 16:24.085
Well met.

16:25.165 --> 16:26.205
Well met.

16:28.325 --> 16:31.405
Got through the first two days
without destroying the school, have we?

16:32.285 --> 16:33.965
Very droll, Your Greatness.

16:35.565 --> 16:36.845
I now declare...

16:37.605 --> 16:39.765
this grand flying contest...

16:40.045 --> 16:40.885
open!

16:45.565 --> 16:49.885
I hope to see
some inspired broomstick work today.

16:50.165 --> 16:51.725
Inspired enough...

16:52.645 --> 16:55.205
to deserve... this!

16:57.765 --> 16:59.445
One lucky witch

16:59.525 --> 17:02.165
is going to have her dream come true.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.685
You're not still mad, are you?

17:12.885 --> 17:14.244
Come on, Star.

17:14.925 --> 17:16.005
It's time.

17:31.005 --> 17:32.205
Next contestants.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.485
Felicity and friends,
to the arena, please.

17:51.845 --> 17:53.245
Nice and quiet, Star.

17:53.605 --> 17:56.445
Just get us round that slalom like
we've practiced and the prize is ours.

17:57.365 --> 17:59.765
-You're still going through with it?
-I have to.

18:00.325 --> 18:01.685
Or my mum will never be magical.

18:03.005 --> 18:04.485
It won't change anything between us,

18:04.565 --> 18:05.565
will it?

18:06.125 --> 18:08.605
What's in that bag, Mildred Hubble?

18:09.325 --> 18:10.325
Tabby, of course.

18:11.285 --> 18:13.645
Really? Isn't that Tabby?

18:16.645 --> 18:18.045
What's in that bag?

18:18.125 --> 18:19.125
What have you got?

18:20.005 --> 18:20.845
Nothing.

18:21.485 --> 18:22.565
What have you got?

18:43.165 --> 18:44.125
What have you--

18:45.365 --> 18:46.245
Leave me alone!

18:49.445 --> 18:50.845
Give me!

18:52.045 --> 18:52.885
No!

18:55.125 --> 18:56.805
Give it--

19:01.965 --> 19:03.685
And this term started so well.

19:15.765 --> 19:16.965
Dog!

19:17.045 --> 19:18.125
You've got a dog!

19:48.445 --> 19:50.965
Wow.

19:55.165 --> 19:56.445
A competent performance,

19:56.525 --> 19:59.365
but I've yet to see
anything truly invigorating.

19:59.445 --> 20:00.765
Ethel! Stop!

20:04.325 --> 20:05.885
Please!

20:09.885 --> 20:10.725
Mildred!

20:12.045 --> 20:14.045
No!

20:19.045 --> 20:19.925
Mildred!

20:25.525 --> 20:27.125
Oh dear.

20:37.245 --> 20:39.725
Ah!

20:48.725 --> 20:49.565
What have we done?

20:55.645 --> 20:57.045
Bravo!

21:08.285 --> 21:10.405
What an extraordinary performance.

21:10.485 --> 21:14.325
A spectacular display of stunt flying!

21:14.405 --> 21:17.125
-But your Greatness--
-Yes! Yes, wasn't it?

21:17.205 --> 21:19.485
I don't think
there's any competition here.

21:21.525 --> 21:22.605
Mildred Hubble.

21:22.685 --> 21:23.725
Ethel Hallow.

21:24.525 --> 21:28.605
These two have obviously
put their rivalry aside.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.485
A shining example to us all.

21:32.365 --> 21:33.925
So, I have decided...

21:34.485 --> 21:37.045
to award a joint prize.

21:38.085 --> 21:39.485
She cheated.

21:45.045 --> 21:46.725
And here's when she gets found out.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.485
She used a dog.

21:49.445 --> 21:50.285
That's right.

21:50.765 --> 21:53.285
Mildred Hubble, the hero,

21:53.365 --> 21:55.325
has a dog in her rucksack.

21:55.685 --> 21:57.005
A dog?

21:57.365 --> 21:58.605
At Cackle's?

21:58.685 --> 21:59.525
This is outrageous.

22:00.365 --> 22:01.365
You know my rules.

22:02.565 --> 22:03.725
Let's see the evidence.

22:06.045 --> 22:07.125
Ethel, please.

22:07.205 --> 22:08.485
I need this.

22:08.565 --> 22:09.685
-Not for me--
-You see?

22:10.405 --> 22:11.685
A dog!

22:13.325 --> 22:14.165
But...

22:14.965 --> 22:16.605
Oh, Ethel.

22:19.165 --> 22:20.405
She did cheat.

22:20.485 --> 22:22.005
I'm not lying.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.485
I saw it.

22:25.765 --> 22:28.605
Mildred Hubble is not a cheat.

22:28.685 --> 22:29.565
Sybil!

22:30.285 --> 22:34.285
She is a courageous, determined
and most of all...

22:34.365 --> 22:35.885
honest witch.

22:37.645 --> 22:38.725
Ethel Hallow.

22:40.845 --> 22:43.485
Consider yourself disqualified

22:43.565 --> 22:45.725
for unsporting behavior.

22:47.885 --> 22:49.365
Mildred Hubble.

22:51.485 --> 22:53.805
This is yours...

22:53.885 --> 22:54.765
alone.

23:12.165 --> 23:13.005
Sorry.

23:16.885 --> 23:17.965
I can't.

23:21.125 --> 23:22.165
Star.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.885
Oh, Mildred.

23:33.845 --> 23:35.125
Then this...

23:36.285 --> 23:38.285
is yours alone...

23:38.365 --> 23:40.885
Ethel Hallow.

23:53.685 --> 23:55.125
Honestly, this school.

23:55.925 --> 23:56.885
Mildred Hubble.

23:57.845 --> 23:59.645
A real witch, you may be.

24:00.605 --> 24:03.005
A great witch, you are not.

24:05.885 --> 24:06.805
It's mine.

24:07.245 --> 24:09.365
It's actually mine.

24:10.285 --> 24:12.965
And I know exactly what I'm going to...

24:14.925 --> 24:16.045
wish for.

24:16.405 --> 24:19.285
The only thing you will wish for,
Ethel Hallow,

24:19.365 --> 24:24.365
is that I had never set eyes
on such a shameful flying display.

24:25.405 --> 24:26.925
Miss Hardbroom--

24:27.005 --> 24:30.485
Neither of you may be trusted
with such a powerful potion as this.

24:31.165 --> 24:35.245
It is, therefore... confiscated.

24:36.125 --> 24:37.285
But Miss Hardbroom...

24:40.485 --> 24:42.365
Miss Hardbroom
is quite right.

24:42.765 --> 24:44.245
Fighting in public.

24:44.325 --> 24:46.245
In front of the Great Wizard.

24:47.165 --> 24:49.485
Ethel, I will deal with you first.

24:49.965 --> 24:53.285
Mildred... wait outside till I'm ready.

24:54.285 --> 24:55.365
Yes, Miss Cackle.

25:07.565 --> 25:08.485
Sybil.

25:09.205 --> 25:10.485
I'm so sorry.

25:12.205 --> 25:14.485
You said all those nice things
about me, but...

25:16.125 --> 25:18.885
Well, I'm not a very good hero,
really, am I?

25:19.405 --> 25:20.605
The worst hero.

25:24.285 --> 25:27.885
You know, the only person you should ever
try to be is yourself.

25:29.885 --> 25:32.645
Except maybe when you find yourself
outside the Head's office.

25:37.205 --> 25:38.365
I knew it was bad.

25:39.565 --> 25:41.245
But not "call Mum in" bad.

25:42.805 --> 25:45.525
-Miss Hardbroom--
-You heard Miss Cackle.

25:45.605 --> 25:50.205
One week of detentions with Miss Drill
for sporting behavior lessons.

25:50.285 --> 25:51.365
Starting today.

25:54.925 --> 25:55.805
Ah!

26:00.925 --> 26:05.365
I implore you, once again,
not to make this monumental mistake.

26:20.405 --> 26:22.125
I am so disappointed in you.

26:22.805 --> 26:24.245
I only did it because--

26:24.725 --> 26:27.925
You did it because you were missing
your mother. Am I right?

26:28.005 --> 26:32.045
I had already made some efforts
to help with that, Mildred.

26:33.765 --> 26:34.885
Miss Cackle?

26:35.405 --> 26:38.925
I was interested to hear
about Ms Hubble's art degree.

26:39.445 --> 26:42.125
Especially as we are in need
of an art teacher.

26:43.725 --> 26:47.285
It's highly irregular to have
non-magical staff members,

26:48.365 --> 26:50.445
but it will do you good
to have your mother here,

26:50.525 --> 26:53.085
and the other girls
will benefit immensely too.

26:53.165 --> 26:54.565
As will the staff.

26:55.765 --> 26:57.005
To put it another way:

26:58.725 --> 27:02.125
I hope that Ms Hubble will help
keep you in line.

27:03.365 --> 27:04.605
Ms Hubble.

27:05.485 --> 27:09.005
Miss Cackle offered me the job earlier.
And I accepted.

27:09.885 --> 27:11.245
Mum! That's amazing!

27:12.525 --> 27:13.885
Welcome to Cackle's!

27:13.965 --> 27:16.485
Thank you again, Miss Cackle.
You won't regret it.

27:17.005 --> 27:18.485
Yes, thank you, Miss Cackle!

27:18.565 --> 27:19.565
Thank you so much!

27:28.605 --> 27:30.365
Can I please keep the dog too?

27:30.445 --> 27:32.365
Don't push your luck, Mildred. Sorry.

27:34.885 --> 27:39.005
Oh, Ada. I do hope you know
what you're doing.
