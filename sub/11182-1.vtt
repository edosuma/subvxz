* Well, we're movin' on up
* Movin' on up

00:04.367 --> 00:07.200
* To the East Side
* Movin' on up

00:07.267 --> 00:11.533
* To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.600 --> 00:14.600

* Movin' on up

00:14.667 --> 00:17.767
* To the East Side

00:17.833 --> 00:23.367
* We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.433 --> 00:26.000
* Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.067 --> 00:28.633
* Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.700 --> 00:31.233
* Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.300 --> 00:33.833
* Just to get up that hill

00:33.900 --> 00:36.433
* Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.500 --> 00:39.000
* Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.067 --> 00:41.500
* As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.567 --> 00:43.233
* There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.300 --> 00:46.033
* We're movin' on up

* We finally got

01:10.633 --> 01:12.033
Damn, where is it?

01:12.100 --> 01:13.600
Florence, you seen
the morning paper?

01:14.900 --> 01:15.967
I should have known...

01:35.467 --> 01:36.767
Hmm...

01:36.833 --> 01:37.900
Mmm, mmm, mmm...

01:39.500 --> 01:40.667
Florence...

01:40.733 --> 01:43.600
Wait a minute. I'm
reading Dear Abby.

01:43.667 --> 01:47.033
It's about this woman
who's getting a rash
all over her body

01:47.100 --> 01:50.067
because her husband
goes to bed at night with
long wooly underwear.

01:50.967 --> 01:51.967
Florence!

01:52.033 --> 01:53.400
And every night it...

01:53.467 --> 01:54.533
It what?

01:54.600 --> 01:56.267
It's continued
on page 31.

01:58.067 --> 01:59.800
Would you put that back?

01:59.867 --> 02:01.033
Oh, look.

02:01.100 --> 02:03.100
The meat market's having
a sale on prime rump.

02:03.167 --> 02:04.900
Good. Now get
your rump out of here.

02:08.700 --> 02:10.000
Good morning, Florence.

02:10.067 --> 02:11.167
Oh, good morning,
Miss Jefferson.

02:11.233 --> 02:12.300
George?

02:14.533 --> 02:15.900
George!

02:15.967 --> 02:18.400
Why don't you give him a kiss?
He might turn into a prince.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.633
-George, are you asleep?
-Yes!

02:22.700 --> 02:25.500
Well, wake up! It's such
a beautiful day.

02:25.567 --> 02:26.767
It was.

02:26.833 --> 02:28.500
We should be out
doing something.

02:28.567 --> 02:30.600
-Yeah.
-Enjoying ourselves.

02:30.667 --> 02:32.200
-Yeah.
-Having some fun.

02:32.267 --> 02:34.100
Yeah, let's go.

02:34.167 --> 02:36.467
You ain't going nowhere
but back to work.

02:36.533 --> 02:39.533
Hmm... One look at him
turns a beautiful day ugly.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.200
Good night!

02:42.267 --> 02:45.400
Oh, come on,
George, can't we do
something together?

02:45.467 --> 02:48.600
Sure we can, Weezy. You
sleep at that end of the sofa
and I'll sleep at this end.

02:49.567 --> 02:51.533
Oh, come on, George...

02:51.600 --> 02:53.267
Look, Weezy, this is my
day off. Now you're
always telling me

02:53.333 --> 02:56.033
to relax. Well,
I'm trying to relax!

02:56.100 --> 03:00.533
Okay. I'm staying here
all day nagging you
to go out with me.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.533
Oh, come on, Weezy,
why you gonna do that?
You know I'm...

03:02.600 --> 03:03.733
(DOORBELL RINGING)

03:03.800 --> 03:06.600
And when I nag, nobody sleeps.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.267
-Hi, girl.
-Oh, hi, Helen, come on in.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.067
Just for a minute.
I can't stay.

03:12.133 --> 03:14.367
That's the first good
news I heard today.

03:16.100 --> 03:18.700
Oh? Been listening to
yourself again, George?

03:21.233 --> 03:22.533
What have you
got there, Helen?

03:22.600 --> 03:25.533
This is what I wanted
to show you.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.933
It's some of the work I'm
doing in my art class.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.333
-Art class?
-What do you think?

03:30.400 --> 03:33.700
You drew this?
I think it's wonderful.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.433
That's what I think, too.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.433
It ain't nothing but
a bunch of round circles.

03:39.867 --> 03:41.300
They're oranges.

03:41.367 --> 03:42.533
Well, why ain't they orange?

03:43.600 --> 03:46.133
Because I'm sketching
with charcoal.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.900
Why? You too cheap
to buy crayons?

03:52.967 --> 03:55.100
I didn't know you were
going to art school.

03:55.167 --> 03:57.400
Oh, yes. As a matter of
fact I'm on my way now.

03:57.467 --> 04:01.000
Oh, I just love it, Louise.
And it gets me
out of the house.

04:01.067 --> 04:04.000
Hey, Weezy, that's a
great idea. Why don't you
go to art class?

04:04.067 --> 04:06.433
-What?
-That's a terrific idea!

04:06.500 --> 04:08.367
-You could join today.
-Right.

04:08.433 --> 04:10.167
Oh, I don't know...

04:10.233 --> 04:11.933
You wouldn't mind
being left on your own,
would you, George?

04:12.000 --> 04:14.300
No. I'm willing to
make the sacrifice.

04:15.467 --> 04:17.167
But I want...

04:17.233 --> 04:19.233
Girl, you said yourself
you loved art when you
were in high school.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.400
-Yes, but...
-And you were always painting
when we first got married.

04:22.467 --> 04:25.400
That was because we
couldn't afford wallpaper.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.767
Oh, come on, Louise,
you'll enjoy it.

04:31.133 --> 04:32.900
Well...

04:32.967 --> 04:34.300
Will you come, too, George?

04:34.367 --> 04:36.367
Hell, no. I ain't going to
nobody's art class.

04:38.233 --> 04:40.233
But I wanted to do
something together.

04:40.300 --> 04:43.467
But, Weezy, you'll be
doing something together.
With Helen.

04:45.133 --> 04:47.167
Oh, well, okay.
It might be fun.

04:47.233 --> 04:48.600
(DOORBELL RINGING)

04:48.667 --> 04:51.100
Sure it will. And look,
Weezy, instead of oranges,

04:51.167 --> 04:52.500
draw me a cheeseburger.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.233
A cheeseburger?

04:56.300 --> 04:57.900
Yeah, look, I don't know
nothing about art, but I
know what I like.

04:57.967 --> 04:58.967
(LAUGHS)

04:59.700 --> 05:00.867
(LAUGHS LOUDLY)

05:05.967 --> 05:08.067
What's so funny, George?

05:08.133 --> 05:10.633
Nothing. I just didn't know
it was Halloween already.

05:12.333 --> 05:14.867
Well, for your information,
this is my golfing outfit.

05:14.933 --> 05:16.900
Oh. (LAUGHING)

05:16.967 --> 05:19.733
Helen, if you want me to
drop you off at your art
class, you better hurry up

05:19.800 --> 05:21.667
or I'm gonna be late
for my tee time.

05:21.733 --> 05:23.800
I thought you were gonna
play golf, not drink tea.

05:25.133 --> 05:27.567
I'm ready, Tom. And
Louise is coming, too.

05:27.633 --> 05:30.467
Great. That'll be nice
company for you.

05:30.533 --> 05:33.233
I wish you had something
to do, too, George.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.333
Yes, it's a shame you
don't play golf. You
could go with Tom.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.567
Helen...

05:38.633 --> 05:40.833
It would be good for you to
get out there on the course.
Wouldn't it, Tom?

05:40.900 --> 05:44.600
Helen, George does not
want to play golf with me.

05:44.667 --> 05:45.900
Damn right.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.633
You see? Now come on.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.267
Why don't you
take it up, George?

05:50.333 --> 05:52.233
Oh, Louise, he'd just
be embarrassed.

05:52.300 --> 05:55.133
It's impossible for a beginner
to play golf just like that.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.567
-That's right.
-George'd look like

05:56.633 --> 05:58.467
an idiot trying to
play against me.

05:59.767 --> 06:00.767
Hold it!

06:02.233 --> 06:04.367
Look, chump, I'll beat
you in golf any day.

06:04.433 --> 06:06.600
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Golf is a very difficult game.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.500
Oh, yeah? All you gotta
do is hit this little ball
with this great big stick!

06:09.567 --> 06:12.300
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Any fool could do that.

06:12.367 --> 06:14.900
Well, why don't you prove
you're as good as any
other fool, George?

06:16.867 --> 06:18.467
Okay, I will.

06:18.533 --> 06:21.933
No, George. I think you ought
to start with miniature golf.

06:24.933 --> 06:27.700
(CHUCKLES)
What's the matter?
You scared I'll beat you?

06:27.767 --> 06:29.567
You? Beat me?

06:29.633 --> 06:32.267
Last week I shot
seven birdies.

06:32.333 --> 06:35.533
Look, don't try to
change the subject.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.300
Now we're talking
about golf, not hunting.

06:39.367 --> 06:41.900
All right, come on.
You asked for it.

06:41.967 --> 06:44.300
-I'm gonna beat the
pants off him.
-Huh!

06:44.367 --> 06:46.533
And with those pants, I'll be
doing everybody a big favor.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.033
You'll enjoy it, Louise.

07:00.100 --> 07:03.433
I hope so.
I'm kind of nervous.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.367
-Oh... Oh, Miss Pomeroy?
-Hello, Helen.

07:06.433 --> 07:09.567
This is my friend, Louise
Jefferson. She'd like
to join the class.

07:09.633 --> 07:13.100
Marvelous! Have you ever
done any drawing before?

07:13.167 --> 07:15.233
Funny you should
ask that. I...

07:15.300 --> 07:18.700
Good. Here's a pad, and
here's some charcoal.

07:18.767 --> 07:21.267
Now we'll worry about
filling out the forms later.

07:21.333 --> 07:22.400
All right...

07:29.567 --> 07:31.200
-Hi.
-Oh, hi.

07:31.267 --> 07:32.867
-First time here, huh?
-Yeah.

07:32.933 --> 07:34.733
-Me, too.
-Oh, good.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.367
I hear she's a good
teacher.

07:36.433 --> 07:38.000
Yeah?

07:38.067 --> 07:41.567
Well, I guess if we both
like it, we'll be seeing a
lot more of each other.

07:41.633 --> 07:42.900
(LAUGHING) Could be.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.033
POMEROY: Charlie...

07:44.100 --> 07:45.467
Well, I gotta go to work now.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.567
Okay.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.567
My God!

08:04.467 --> 08:05.867
He hasn't got anything on!

08:05.933 --> 08:08.333
Of course not.
This is anatomy.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.867
But, but I thought
we were gonna do still life.

08:11.933 --> 08:15.033
We are. He's not moving.

08:17.467 --> 08:19.567
Now go ahead, start drawing.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.200
Oh, my God, I can't!

08:24.467 --> 08:27.100
Louise? Louise,
just do your best.

08:27.167 --> 08:30.867
Nobody expects you to
be perfect the first time.

08:30.933 --> 08:33.367
Well, can't I start with
some oranges?

08:36.700 --> 08:38.033
(LAUGHING)

08:44.400 --> 08:48.533
Go ahead, Louise. You've
seen a nude man before.
What about George?

08:48.600 --> 08:51.400
But George isn't a man.
He's my husband.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.500
Girl, start drawing.

08:57.800 --> 08:58.900
Okay.

09:33.467 --> 09:35.200
Hey!

09:36.200 --> 09:38.400
Come on in, Willis.

09:38.467 --> 09:42.833
I'll mix you a drink.
That's the rule, ain't it? The
winner buys drinks all around?

09:42.900 --> 09:44.867
-George, I...
-And you sure are round.

09:47.567 --> 09:49.533
Look, George, just
because you got lucky...

09:49.600 --> 09:51.700
Lucky? Now, what you
talking about?
I beat you fair and square.

09:51.767 --> 09:53.533
-You did everything wrong.
-Like what?

09:53.600 --> 09:55.600
Well, you're not supposed
to use a driver on the
putting green.

09:56.867 --> 09:58.033
Why not? It worked.

09:58.100 --> 10:00.567
God knows how. Your ball
took off like a rocket,

10:00.633 --> 10:02.567
hit a tree and bounced
back into the hole.

10:03.567 --> 10:04.867
That was a clever shot,
wasn't it?

10:05.900 --> 10:06.933
It was a freak!

10:07.000 --> 10:08.800
It was not, man!
I aimed at that tree!

10:08.867 --> 10:11.800
Here, I beat you! I beat you!
I beat you, I beat you!

10:11.867 --> 10:13.600
George! George!

10:13.667 --> 10:15.400
Winning is not that important.

10:15.467 --> 10:18.200
You're right. The important
thing is you lost.

10:20.767 --> 10:23.833
Well, you don't have to
tell the whole world.

10:23.900 --> 10:26.200
Don't worry about it, Willis.
I wouldn't embarrass you.

10:26.267 --> 10:28.033
-I'll keep it quiet.
-Oh, thank you.

10:28.533 --> 10:29.733
Hey, Florence!

10:29.800 --> 10:31.733
I beat the pants off
old Willis in golf.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.500
Thanks, George.

10:34.567 --> 10:37.000
-He beat you?
-Well, yes.

10:37.067 --> 10:39.033
Lord, you sure must
be a lousy player.

10:40.567 --> 10:42.933
He's a good player.
I'm just great.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.200
Oh, hi, George. Back already?

10:45.267 --> 10:47.767
Hey, hey, Weez. I
slaughtered him.

10:47.833 --> 10:50.633
Oh, Tom, he didn't? You
must have had an off day.

10:50.700 --> 10:53.600
That's right. He was off
all day in the woods
looking for his ball.

10:55.667 --> 10:58.367
Well, I... I guess I'll
get some more ice.

10:58.433 --> 11:01.200
What for, Willis?
You weren't that hot
out there today.

11:04.933 --> 11:07.367
Well, I'm glad you
enjoyed your game, George.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.500
Oh, yeah. Weezy, how'd
you make out in art class?

11:09.567 --> 11:11.633
Did you draw some
little oranges?

11:11.700 --> 11:16.400
Uh, no. We weren't
drawing any fruit today.

11:18.767 --> 11:20.533
Oh, flowers, huh?

11:20.600 --> 11:22.567
Not exactly.

11:22.633 --> 11:23.667
Well, what was it?

11:23.733 --> 11:25.267
It was a live model, George.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.933
Oh... You mean like a
cute little puppy dog.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.300
Hey, that's great!
Let me see it.

11:30.367 --> 11:32.167
Oh, no, George,
it's not
very good.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.333
Come on, Weezy, I know
it's your first try.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.567
No, George!

11:35.633 --> 11:36.833
Look, Weezy, I'm not
gonna laugh at it.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.500
Oh! Get me behind the sheets!

11:41.733 --> 11:43.167
I think I'll go wash up.

11:45.467 --> 11:46.500
Louise!

11:47.967 --> 11:49.733
Get back here!

12:02.033 --> 12:03.833
How could you do
anything so shameful?

12:03.900 --> 12:05.233
Shameful!

12:05.300 --> 12:06.767
How could you sink so low?

12:06.833 --> 12:08.500
Down into the abyss!

12:09.700 --> 12:11.167
How could you do it, Louise!

12:11.233 --> 12:12.867
The serpent whispered
in her ear.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.133
Oh, shut up, Florence!

12:15.200 --> 12:16.933
Louise.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.433
I'm surprised at you
talking like that
to our faithful maid.

12:20.500 --> 12:24.267
Look, George, you are
behaving like a crazy man.

12:24.333 --> 12:25.533
It's just a nude...

12:25.600 --> 12:27.400
It ain't just no nude,
it's a naked dude!

12:30.967 --> 12:33.333
There's nothing wrong
with the naked body!

12:33.400 --> 12:36.600
Oh, no? How would you like it
if I went running around the
street without no clothes on?

12:36.667 --> 12:38.000
Probably nobody would notice.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.867
That's good, Miss Willis.

12:43.633 --> 12:44.800
Aw, shut up, Florence!

12:46.267 --> 12:49.200
Ain't this a blip? One minute
I'm the faithful maid,

12:49.267 --> 12:51.900
and the next minute I'm
a shut up, Florence.

12:51.967 --> 12:54.933
No, you ain't! Now you're
a shut up and get in the
kitchen, Florence!

12:56.000 --> 12:57.200
What's all the shouting about?

12:57.267 --> 12:58.933
-None of your damn business!
-Oh.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.933
I'm surprised at you, Louise.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.367
I never thought that the
mother of my child would be
drawing dirty pictures.

13:09.433 --> 13:12.000
It's not dirty, it's art.

13:12.067 --> 13:13.433
I don't care what his name is!

13:15.633 --> 13:18.133
And you ain't going back to
that class and that's that!

13:18.200 --> 13:21.367
But you're the one
who talked me into
going in the first place!

13:21.433 --> 13:24.967
That's when I thought
you'd be drawing fruit,
not that weirdo.

13:25.033 --> 13:27.367
Weirdo? That man is a
professional model!

13:27.433 --> 13:30.067
Oh, yeah? And what does
he model? Open raincoats?

13:32.100 --> 13:34.233
Oh, come on, George...

13:34.300 --> 13:37.333
No, you come on! Now look,
if he had any decency, he
would have posed like this!

13:39.933 --> 13:41.733
Good, Miss Jefferson,
that's where to hit him.

13:48.267 --> 13:49.600
What's so funny?

13:49.667 --> 13:51.533
-You.
-Funny, huh?

13:51.600 --> 13:55.533
My wife spends half the
morning with some naked man,
and with her eyes wide open!

13:55.600 --> 13:57.667
That ain't funny!

13:57.733 --> 14:01.400
It's no use, Louise. You know
what they say? Small minds
come in small packages.

14:01.467 --> 14:03.900
Oh, yeah? Well, I've got one
place for this small package.

14:03.967 --> 14:05.267
What are you gonna do?

14:05.333 --> 14:06.700
I'm gonna get rid of this
thing throw it in the trash.

14:06.767 --> 14:07.600
I ain't keeping this
mess in my house!

14:07.667 --> 14:09.533
Oh, now just a second, buster!

14:10.633 --> 14:12.400
This is my house, too.

14:12.467 --> 14:13.467
Right on, sister.

14:13.533 --> 14:15.033
And you can't tell
me what to do.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.000
Right on, sister.

14:17.067 --> 14:21.500
And I have got a right to keep
my picture as much as you have
to keep your naked women!

14:21.567 --> 14:23.633
Right on! Naked women?

14:25.800 --> 14:28.200
Why, George, you
little old devil, you.

14:30.033 --> 14:31.233
Naked women, where?

14:31.300 --> 14:33.100
Yeah? Where? Where?

14:33.167 --> 14:36.400
In the back of the
closet, at the bottom
of your duffle bag

14:36.467 --> 14:39.500
under your old Navy uniform.

14:39.567 --> 14:42.900
Oh, these are them old
pictures, some old pin up
pictures from the service!

14:42.967 --> 14:44.033
How'd you know
about them anyway?

14:45.533 --> 14:48.300
Florence found them when
she was cleaning.

14:48.367 --> 14:50.833
How come she never cleans
places where we can see?

14:53.233 --> 14:58.200
So, George, what's good
for the gander is good
for this mother goose.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.800
Right on, Mother.

15:02.333 --> 15:03.667
You shut up!

15:03.733 --> 15:06.367
Oh, why don't you give up,
George? You know you're wrong.

15:06.433 --> 15:07.600
Oh, I am, am I?

15:07.667 --> 15:09.200
And I suppose your husband
don't care about you

15:09.267 --> 15:11.733
going around painting
strangers in their
birthday suits.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.967
Of course not.
Tom has an
open mind.

15:14.033 --> 15:16.567
Yeah, you're right about
that. It's so open you
can see right through it.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.233
Mind if I make myself
another drink?

15:20.300 --> 15:23.333
Look, before you do that,
I think your wife has
something to ask you.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.200
Go on, ask him!

15:25.267 --> 15:26.267
Okay.

15:29.067 --> 15:32.100
Tom, now something
happened in art class today.

15:32.167 --> 15:34.467
Oh, I know. Florence told
me all about it.

15:34.533 --> 15:39.167
You see? Tom doesn't
mind a bit if I draw a man
in the nude. Do you, dear?

15:42.267 --> 15:43.333
Do you, Tom?

15:43.867 --> 15:45.133
Well...

15:45.200 --> 15:47.100
What's "well" supposed
to mean?

15:47.167 --> 15:49.767
It's just a "well".
I often start a
sentence with a "well".

15:51.100 --> 15:52.800
Well, finish it.

15:54.067 --> 15:56.333
Well... Well, well...

15:58.933 --> 16:01.000
You haven't answered
my question.

16:01.067 --> 16:02.133
Oh.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.500
Well...

16:03.567 --> 16:05.767
I'm sorry. The wells just
keep welling up in me today.

16:09.900 --> 16:13.067
Frankly, Helen, I'd be much
happier if you'd stick
to oranges.

16:13.133 --> 16:14.367
Oranges!

16:14.433 --> 16:15.967
-Or apples?
-See?

16:16.033 --> 16:18.300
Now you're beginning to
sound just like George!

16:18.367 --> 16:21.000
Next you'll be saying I can't
go to my art class anymore!

16:21.067 --> 16:22.133
Well...

16:23.567 --> 16:25.800
Will you excuse me,
Louise? I have to go upstairs.

16:25.867 --> 16:27.800
Oh? Something you have to do?

16:27.867 --> 16:30.567
No. Something I have
to get away from.

16:30.633 --> 16:32.200
I'll be up in a few
minutes, dear.

16:32.267 --> 16:33.600
Who cares?

16:34.733 --> 16:36.167
Sore loser!

16:37.667 --> 16:39.533
All right, Louise.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.667
Now that we've all agreed that
that's a dirty picture let me
have it and I'll...

16:41.733 --> 16:44.033
I haven't voted yet.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.667
What?

16:45.733 --> 16:48.367
Let me tell you something,
George. I'm going to
that art class.

16:48.433 --> 16:50.333
And I like this picture!

16:50.400 --> 16:52.767
In fact, I like it so much

16:52.833 --> 16:57.367
I'm gonna put it right
over here where
everybody can see it.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.700
Oh, Weezy, come on...

16:58.767 --> 17:00.733
And you better not
touch it or else!

17:00.800 --> 17:01.833
Or else what?

17:03.267 --> 17:05.033
Ask me tonight, George.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.367
Okay, I won't touch
your picture.

17:11.433 --> 17:12.467
(DOORBELL RINGING)

17:12.533 --> 17:13.833
You promise?

17:13.900 --> 17:14.900
I promise.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.200
I can't hear you!

17:16.267 --> 17:18.967
I promise! I promise! Can
you hear me now?

17:19.767 --> 17:22.133
Oh, perfectly.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.400
In fact, I could hear you
when the door was closed.

17:25.433 --> 17:26.500
What do you want?

17:26.567 --> 17:28.333
Could I borrow a colander?

17:28.400 --> 17:31.133
I'll save you the trouble.
It's Saturday the 18th.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.600
Oh, no, no. No, no.

17:32.667 --> 17:36.233
Not a calendar, I need a
colander to drain my noodles.

17:38.767 --> 17:41.833
-Come in, Mr. Bentley.
-Oh, thank you, Mrs. J.

17:41.900 --> 17:44.700
You see, I'm fixing beef
Stroganoff for Susan and...

17:44.767 --> 17:47.033
-I'll see if I can find one.
-Thank you.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.100
-Hi, Bentley.
-Hello, Mr. Willis.

17:49.167 --> 17:51.267
-And how's your lovely wife?
-Angry.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.133
Ahh...

17:53.200 --> 17:54.200
Well, it's all because of him.

17:56.167 --> 17:58.800
Oh, I say.

17:58.867 --> 18:02.767
If this is the way you caught
him, you're the one who
ought to be angry.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.733
Oh, no, no, you don't
understand, Mr. Bentley.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.233
Look, look, and it's
signed Louise Jefferson.

18:06.300 --> 18:09.600
My goodness, I had no idea
she did this sort of thing.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.667
Oh, look, she's gonna put
pants on him next week.

18:13.233 --> 18:15.167
Oh, heavens, no.

18:15.233 --> 18:18.067
The unclothed body is a
beautiful sight to behold.

18:18.133 --> 18:21.467
As a matter of fact, I was
trying to convince Susan
of that last evening.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.333
Just before she left.

18:24.733 --> 18:26.700
But, getting back
to the sketch...

18:26.767 --> 18:28.733
Look, can't we change
the subject?

18:28.800 --> 18:32.467
Oh, certainly. You know
my Great Great Uncle
Jonathan was an artist.

18:32.533 --> 18:34.533
I said change the subject!

18:34.600 --> 18:38.233
Oh, I just did. You see, now
I'm talking about my
Great Great Uncle Jonathan.

18:38.300 --> 18:42.300
He was far ahead of his time.
He wanted to paint Queen
Victoria in the nude.

18:42.367 --> 18:44.333
But of course,
they wouldn't allow it.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.833
I should hope not.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.433
Oh, no, they made him
put on a bathrobe first.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.167
-Here you are.
-Oh, thank you.

18:52.233 --> 18:54.267
Is there anything else
you need?

18:54.333 --> 18:59.333
Well, I, uh, I could use that
perfect palate of yours to
sample my Stroganoff.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.433
You see, it's the first
time I've made it.

19:01.500 --> 19:05.133
Oh, I guess I can taste
it for you. I'll only be
a minute, George.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.133
Cheery bye.

19:07.200 --> 19:11.000
Oh, boy. What a lousy day this
has turned out to be.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.533
Yep.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.900
The only bright spot in it
was me beating you in golf.

19:15.967 --> 19:21.233
The only reason you won
was because you're twice
as close to the ball as I am.

19:21.300 --> 19:24.900
Oh, yeah? Well, at least
I don't have to lean over
my stomach to see the ball.

19:24.967 --> 19:26.200
What?

19:26.267 --> 19:27.300
Look, Willis, I'm just
trying to help you.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.200
You help me?

19:29.267 --> 19:32.500
Look, you know what your
problem is? Your stomach
gets in the way of your swing.

19:32.567 --> 19:35.700
Now either you got to stop
eating so much, or

19:35.767 --> 19:38.133
you gotta try the Willie
Mays swing like this.

19:38.967 --> 19:40.400
(GASPING)

19:40.467 --> 19:41.700
Now see what you did?

19:41.767 --> 19:43.267
Me? It was your fault!

19:43.333 --> 19:44.633
I was showing you your swing!

19:44.700 --> 19:46.667
Well, you better do
something quick.

19:46.733 --> 19:48.100
Hurry, George, hurry up.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.133
Is it coming off?

19:51.200 --> 19:52.800
Yeah. All of it.

19:56.567 --> 19:57.733
George!

19:57.800 --> 19:59.733
Oh, no!

19:59.800 --> 20:02.967
You couldn't wait until
my back was turned,
could you?

20:03.033 --> 20:04.900
No, no, it was an
accident, Weezy.

20:04.967 --> 20:09.300
Oh, sure. Accidently
that napkin jumped
up into your hand

20:09.367 --> 20:12.067
and accidently your hand
smeared my picture!

20:12.133 --> 20:13.700
No, no, it really was an
accident. Ask Willis.

20:13.767 --> 20:15.733
-(STAMMERING)
-Oh, he's on your side,

20:15.800 --> 20:17.300
George. I'm not asking
him anything.

20:17.367 --> 20:19.900
Oh, then I'm not needed
here any longer.

20:19.967 --> 20:21.300
Come back here, you coward!

20:21.367 --> 20:23.533
Coward? I'm going
up to face Helen.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.333
You promised, George.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.767
Weezy, I didn't
do it on purpose.

20:28.833 --> 20:30.767
You promised and you
broke your promise!

20:30.833 --> 20:32.567
-I'm telling you...
-I don't wanna hear anymore.

20:32.633 --> 20:34.800
No, Weezy, will you
listen to me?

20:34.867 --> 20:38.467
I don't wanna hear anymore!
I don't wanna talk to you and
don't you talk to me! Ever!

20:40.833 --> 20:43.933
Weezy, you come out of
there! You're wrong!

20:44.000 --> 20:46.967
I'm the one that's supposed
to get mad and lock themselves
in there, not you!

20:47.767 --> 20:49.000
Get out!

20:51.400 --> 20:54.467
If I was you, I wouldn't
be making up to her,
Mr. Jefferson.

20:54.533 --> 20:55.833
What?

20:55.900 --> 20:58.567
Look, I heard everything, even
when I wasn't listening.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.767
And you're right
about that picture.
It's the devil's work.

21:02.833 --> 21:04.400
Look, I don't care
about no picture.

21:04.467 --> 21:06.233
What am I gonna do?
She won't even talk to me.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.733
Who pays the rent around here?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.300
I do.

21:09.367 --> 21:11.167
And who pays for all the
food and all the clothes?

21:11.233 --> 21:13.733
-I do.
-And who's the boss
around here?

21:13.800 --> 21:15.333
-Me!
-Then act like it.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.100
Go up to that door
and lay down the law.

21:17.167 --> 21:19.267
-Right!
-Tell her who the man
of the house is.

21:19.333 --> 21:20.533
Right!

21:21.867 --> 21:23.833
All right now, Louise.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.833
I am the man of this house

21:25.900 --> 21:29.433
and I pay all of the bills,
and I'm ordering you
to come out here!

21:33.333 --> 21:34.867
All right, I'm
gonna count to three.

21:35.467 --> 21:36.467
One...

21:36.967 --> 21:38.000
Two...

21:38.767 --> 21:39.767
Uh, three...

21:43.633 --> 21:45.133
-Didn't work.
-I knew it wouldn't.

21:51.867 --> 21:55.633
Oh, come on, Weezy, you
know I wouldn't do that
to your picture on purpose.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.167
It was an accident.

21:58.033 --> 22:01.067
I can't prove it, but it was.

22:01.133 --> 22:04.433
Look, come on, Weezy, let's
make up. I'll let you do
anything you want.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.900
I'll let you go back
to the art class, okay?

22:10.100 --> 22:11.533
And you can draw
anything you want.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.600
Okay?

22:13.567 --> 22:14.567
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

22:17.300 --> 22:18.767
Oh, okay.

22:18.833 --> 22:20.267
You wanna do things
together, right?

22:21.367 --> 22:23.433
Okay, this is what we'll do.

22:23.500 --> 22:26.700
The next time you
go to the art class,
I'll go with you. Okay?

22:29.400 --> 22:31.967
Oh, George...

22:37.833 --> 22:40.300
It'll be just fine, Louise.

22:40.367 --> 22:42.333
Here you are,
Mr. Jefferson.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.667
I'm so glad you decided
to join us.

22:44.733 --> 22:45.733
Me, too.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.000
You'll get a kick
out of it, George.

22:50.067 --> 22:53.600
Sure, I will. When are they
gonna start? I gotta watch
a game on TV tonight.

22:53.667 --> 22:56.500
Oh, this is better than a
silly old ball game.

22:56.567 --> 22:58.033
Sure it is, Weezy.

22:58.100 --> 23:00.500
A class like this broadens
your horizons.

23:00.567 --> 23:01.600
Sure, Weezy.

23:01.667 --> 23:04.067
You look at the world
with new eyes.

23:04.133 --> 23:08.167
You look at things
with a completely
different perspective.

23:08.233 --> 23:09.633
All right, class.

23:09.700 --> 23:10.767
Nancy.

23:22.167 --> 23:23.833
Oh, damn!

23:23.900 --> 23:25.067
Whoo!

23:25.133 --> 23:26.767
Hurt me!

23:32.267 --> 23:34.367
-What happened to Charlie?
-Who cares?

23:36.633 --> 23:37.733
Don't look, George.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.567
Well, you looked at
Charlie, didn't you?

23:39.633 --> 23:42.000
-But that was different!
-You're damn right.
It was a whole lot different.

23:43.467 --> 23:45.700
Come on, George,
we are leaving.

23:45.767 --> 23:50.633
Look, Weezy, like you said,
what's good for the goose
is good for this gander.

23:50.700 --> 23:56.533
Oh, yeah? Well you take
one more gander and
your goose is cooked.

23:56.600 --> 24:00.633
Like I said, Weezy,
I don't know much about
art, but I know what I like.

24:02.167 --> 24:03.167
Wait a minute!

24:04.433 --> 24:05.433
We'll be back.

24:37.367 --> 24:41.567
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.667
* Movin', movin' on up
