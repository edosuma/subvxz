00:01.218 --> 00:02.698
Previously onMotherland .

00:02.741 --> 00:03.786
Tonight...

00:04.526 --> 00:06.397
We offer up the witch.

00:06.441 --> 00:07.659
[woman] And the Dodgers
can keep her safe,

00:08.356 --> 00:09.400
[Silver] I'm concerned that
Penelope will become a target.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.054
Can you guarantee her safety?

00:11.446 --> 00:13.274
Don't worry,
Mr. Vice President.
We take care of our own.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.276
I then use that same work

00:15.319 --> 00:17.234
to start the Spree...

00:17.278 --> 00:19.932
[woman 2] W ith the capture
of Nicte Batan.

00:19.976 --> 00:22.892
-You will step down.
-They've engineered it

00:22.935 --> 00:25.068
to become a
self-sustaining hunter.

00:25.112 --> 00:27.244
-It's here.
-Is she the source?

00:27.288 --> 00:29.377
[screeching]

00:33.468 --> 00:34.382
[grunts]

00:40.692 --> 00:42.825
I have a warrant for
the arrest of your daughter

00:42.868 --> 00:44.087
and her unit for murder.

00:44.131 --> 00:45.784
You guys need to disappear.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.090
We'll head west.
Get lost in the Cession.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.005
We have to take Nicte
with us.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.746
Thanks for saving my ass, Red.

00:50.789 --> 00:51.877
Ow.

00:52.574 --> 00:54.054
It's not every day you
kill your own daughter.

00:54.097 --> 00:57.100
You will be hailed
as a hero, Mr. President.

00:58.667 --> 01:02.062
â™ªâ™ª

01:30.307 --> 01:33.571
[women vocalizing]

01:56.725 --> 01:58.509
[vocalizing continues]

02:11.783 --> 02:15.004
[gasps]

02:40.029 --> 02:41.770
[women in unison]

02:55.914 --> 02:57.612
[opening theme plays]

04:03.547 --> 04:05.288
[country song plays on radio]

04:21.304 --> 04:24.089
Okay, who mixed three-hole
with plain letter?

04:24.133 --> 04:27.092
Little too keen for Dodger of
the month, aren't you, Red?

04:27.136 --> 04:29.878
She's right. Bring it down
about 87% percent

04:29.921 --> 04:31.488
-and you'll be in the zone.
-[chuckles]

04:35.057 --> 04:36.319
[moaning]

04:42.891 --> 04:44.371
I want you so bad.

04:44.414 --> 04:45.502
Here I am.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.549
You're wearing
way too many clothes.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.421
-We could just--
-Tell me.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.775
[chuckles]

04:59.299 --> 05:01.736
[giggling]

05:01.779 --> 05:02.824
[woman]
Paul in the office...

05:04.434 --> 05:06.306
[indistinct chatter]

05:16.054 --> 05:17.795
I know, but if someone
would always...

05:23.192 --> 05:24.411
[Mac] All right, listen up.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.587
I want all this relabeled to
ship out in the morning.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.719
It's tedious I know,
but why are we doing this?

05:28.763 --> 05:30.330
[all]
To maintain the appearance

05:30.808 --> 05:34.334
of a robust shipping
and receiving operation
at all times.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.336
Uh, why is all that
copy paper over there?

05:37.989 --> 05:39.948
Seems like a good place for it.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.123
[Mac]
It's been a month.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.559
You should know by now

05:42.603 --> 05:44.169
that it's not
a good place for it.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.607
Because this is shipping
and that is receiving.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.739
Understood. Thanks, Mac.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.393
And why is this
important to everyone?

05:50.437 --> 05:51.916
[all] Because we're
one of the biggest

05:51.960 --> 05:53.483
distribution centers
in the area.

05:53.527 --> 05:54.528
[Mac]
That's right, we are!

05:54.571 --> 05:55.746
And the better we keep this up,

05:55.790 --> 05:57.574
the longer we stay free.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.576
[all] Which is exactly what
Dodgers need to be!

05:59.620 --> 06:01.143
Enjoy your day, everyone!

06:02.623 --> 06:06.148
Don't get too attached
to Mr. Funtimes.

06:06.191 --> 06:07.541
We're gonna have to
move on soon.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.022
Also, you need to
change your faces.

06:11.066 --> 06:12.546
Not gonna happen.

06:12.589 --> 06:14.417
[scoffs] My work
too dirty for you?

06:14.461 --> 06:16.680
Yes, Batan. In fact, it is.

06:16.724 --> 06:17.899
That goes for me, too.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.554
[Nicte] Do you think these
people want you here?

06:20.597 --> 06:21.859
Looking like that?

06:23.470 --> 06:24.471
Think hard about it.

06:34.089 --> 06:34.959
[woman]
You're gonna do great.

06:35.830 --> 06:37.788
I think you're very brave,
by the way.

06:39.834 --> 06:40.878
Appreciate that.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.970
Right now, you are living
every father's nightmare.

06:46.667 --> 06:47.842
The loss of a child.

06:48.625 --> 06:49.931
Your beloved Penelope.

06:51.367 --> 06:54.065
What question would you
most like to ask the people

06:54.109 --> 06:55.763
who killed your daughter?

06:55.806 --> 06:57.634
Let's name these people.

06:57.678 --> 06:58.940
Why we be coy here?

06:59.767 --> 07:02.291
I'm referring to Officer Cadets
Abigail Bellweather

07:02.334 --> 07:04.511
Raelle Collar,
and Tally Craven

07:04.554 --> 07:06.817
who are all currently
fugitives from justice.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.124
[woman]
These young women
have yet to be charged.

07:09.167 --> 07:10.908
[Silver]
They escaped along the
way to their arraignment.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.562
If they were innocent,
why would they run?

07:12.606 --> 07:13.737
Back to the question.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.087
What would
you like to ask them?

07:20.527 --> 07:21.745
Why did it have to be her?

07:22.616 --> 07:24.400
Penelope was probably the...

07:25.575 --> 07:26.881
most gentle person
in the entire world.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.013
She didn't deserve this,

07:29.057 --> 07:30.580
especially not from the people

07:30.624 --> 07:31.755
who promised to protect her.

07:33.191 --> 07:34.715
Did you know there are
thought to be

07:34.758 --> 07:36.325
as many as 16,000
unregistered witches

07:36.368 --> 07:37.544
living in the US?

07:38.196 --> 07:39.371
Many apparently
hiding in the Cession?

07:40.242 --> 07:42.592
We need to know who
they are and where they are.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.202
which is why I've
gathered funding

07:44.246 --> 07:46.553
for a new genealogical
research project

07:46.596 --> 07:49.381
to identify those with
unknown witch ancestry

07:49.425 --> 07:51.383
so that we can protect them.

07:52.254 --> 07:54.735
"Protect"...
with pile of burning logs.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.434
[Sterling in Farspeech]
Are you watching this?

07:58.478 --> 07:59.304
[in Farspeech]
People are gonna eat this up.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.220
How are things on your end?

08:02.264 --> 08:03.439
[in Farspeech]
The Fetch is planted.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.396
He has a lunch date tomorrow.

08:06.224 --> 08:07.443
[in Farspeech]
Girlfriend of the week?

08:07.487 --> 08:08.879
[in Farspeech] Maybe.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.490
[Silver]
Safety is my main concern.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.276
We believe you.
Well, most of us do.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.539
I'll speak for myself.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.888
I believe you're innocent.

08:19.020 --> 08:21.718
You're safe with us for as
long as you need.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.241
Just please...

08:25.461 --> 08:27.376
Make sure that
we're safe with you.

08:27.419 --> 08:28.943
now that we
have to watch out

08:28.986 --> 08:30.292
for the Camarilla
as well as the army.

08:30.858 --> 08:31.902
Follow our rules.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.878
The Witch plague
vaccine is nearly there.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.837
It will be ready for
a mass inoculation

08:53.881 --> 08:56.057
for all active duty
personnel in a week.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.973
-Excellent.
-How goes the transition?

09:00.191 --> 09:03.455
Calamitous. But this is
what I'm made for.

09:03.499 --> 09:06.197
When can we be sure
the entire base is cleared
of that poison?

09:06.241 --> 09:08.330
The markings on the trees
are harmless.

09:09.113 --> 09:10.941
The base is clear.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.727
At least on the ground.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.425
There's an
odd low pressure system

09:16.468 --> 09:18.383
that's been
lingering over the base.

09:18.427 --> 09:19.646
Hm.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.125
I'll dispel it myself.

09:21.169 --> 09:23.519
-I need to clear my head.
-We're on it.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.218
Have you been able
to reach Abigail?

09:28.306 --> 09:29.612
No.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.092
And it's not
doing good things to me.

09:33.660 --> 09:34.878
[bell rings]

09:41.363 --> 09:43.757
[Tiffany] Does the thing on
the news mean we have to move?

09:44.192 --> 09:45.367
Not necessarily.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.152
I don't want to run anymore.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.634
I know it's so fun to see
so many new places all the time,

09:51.678 --> 09:54.681
but it makes you so tired.

09:54.724 --> 09:57.945
gI know. Yeah, my parents
were Dodgers, too.

09:59.381 --> 10:00.991
We started running
when I was about your age.

10:02.819 --> 10:05.605
Is it true that
you were in the Spree?

10:06.344 --> 10:09.260
-Who told you that?
-One of the other kids.

10:09.957 --> 10:12.307
They said I shouldn't
talk to you anymore.

10:13.438 --> 10:16.877
I was... involved with
the Spree. For a while.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.488
But that's nobody's business,

10:19.531 --> 10:21.882
and you get
to pick your own friends.

10:21.925 --> 10:25.189
Is it true that you
whenever you change your face,

10:25.233 --> 10:28.149
it's the face of
someone you murdered?

10:28.889 --> 10:30.934
Absolutely not, Tiffany.

10:32.109 --> 10:34.634
It's just a piece of Work
like any other.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.766
[sub-sonic alarm sounds]

10:36.810 --> 10:38.507
It's okay.
Remember the drill.

10:38.550 --> 10:39.813
Okay, I'll be back.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.771
[alarm continues]

10:52.826 --> 10:54.871
-[clamoring]
-[alarm continues]

11:00.529 --> 11:01.356
[man] Let's go.

11:05.447 --> 11:08.319
It's okay, it's okay.
Everything checked out,

11:08.363 --> 11:10.582
Just a new group of
Dodgers looking to lay low.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.454
Ask me, they've got
that ex-Spree feel.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.326
Anyway, they're exhausted.
I put them to bed.

11:19.548 --> 11:20.767
[Abigail]
Is it bad that I was
kind of looking forward

11:20.810 --> 11:22.420
to a confrontation?

11:22.464 --> 11:24.031
What does that say about me?

11:24.074 --> 11:26.163
-That you're a soldier.
-Nice one, babe.

11:27.730 --> 11:28.905
See you bright and early.

11:30.298 --> 11:32.387
Maybe we can go
finish what we started.

11:45.617 --> 11:46.923
Way to make a girl feel single.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.019
[gasping]

12:00.154 --> 12:00.937
Sorry.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.374
We open at twelve!

12:03.418 --> 12:05.028
[giggling]

12:08.902 --> 12:09.903
It was nice while it lasted.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.385
Remember when
we talked about the lighthouse?

12:15.125 --> 12:15.996
You can watch the boats.

12:18.215 --> 12:19.826
Wouldn't have to
look over our shoulder.

12:23.394 --> 12:26.658
To buy groceries,
take naps, make dinner.

12:27.311 --> 12:28.791
Return library books.

12:30.358 --> 12:32.099
We sound so exciting.

12:32.142 --> 12:33.448
Normal things are nice.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.277
It's a good dream.

12:37.887 --> 12:40.150
-What's wrong with dreaming?
-Nothing.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.851
It's probably the first
time in my life

12:44.894 --> 12:47.027
I ever felt like I had
a future to dream about.

12:47.070 --> 12:47.941
Really?

12:48.593 --> 12:49.681
Yeah.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.119
Do do you, so...

12:55.252 --> 12:57.951
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.695
[grunting]

13:08.613 --> 13:10.354
Haven't seen
that face in a while.

13:11.007 --> 13:14.663
-One of many.
-I saw that picture of you.
Before Liberia.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.230
That's your real face.

13:16.273 --> 13:17.666
This isn't what
I look like anymore.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.233
This is what I look like

13:19.276 --> 13:21.148
when I met Alder
way back when.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.890
Seemed appropriate to wear it
when we met again.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.021
Does it give you any peace...

13:26.544 --> 13:27.415
that she's gone?

13:27.458 --> 13:29.243
[grunting]

13:33.725 --> 13:34.857
Do I seem peaceful?

13:38.295 --> 13:40.036
I don't even know
what that is anymore.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.691
You guys are nuts
not to change your looks.

13:42.734 --> 13:45.346
I know. Let's just say
there's some resistance there.

13:48.305 --> 13:49.872
Would you have
recruited me for the Spree?

13:50.917 --> 13:52.179
Back in the day?

13:52.222 --> 13:54.137
[laughs] No chance.

13:54.181 --> 13:56.574
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

13:56.618 --> 13:57.793
Neither do you.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.491
[grunts]

14:00.883 --> 14:02.667
Talent you've got.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.540
You lack prey drive.

14:05.583 --> 14:06.454
[exclaims]

14:08.499 --> 14:09.544
[grunts]

14:11.067 --> 14:13.896
I see exactly
how gifted you are.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.724
Your Sight is powerful,

14:15.767 --> 14:17.987
but poking around corners
isn't going to save you.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.816
You need to know exactly
where I'll be in 30 seconds.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.949
We didn't really get
that far in War College.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.342
They don't
teach you that juicy,

14:25.386 --> 14:27.779
morally complicated
stuff anyway.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.566
Well, how far ahead
can you see?

14:31.609 --> 14:32.523
Far enough.

14:33.742 --> 14:36.223
For example, I can see...

14:36.788 --> 14:39.356
that a bird's gonna to shit on
your head in about 48 seconds.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.401
[chuckles]

14:40.444 --> 14:42.316
-You in?
-Yes.

14:43.317 --> 14:44.100
You sure now?

14:45.319 --> 14:46.320
This kind of Seeing
can mess you up.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.756
Try me.

14:47.799 --> 14:48.931
[grunts]

14:49.410 --> 14:51.934
Look behind your eyes.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.546
Find the source of your Sight.

14:57.374 --> 15:01.204
Not your eyes,
or your nerves, or your brain.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.208
I'm talking about
the observer herself.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.907
This inner gaze can
be aimed forward

15:07.950 --> 15:09.734
and back in time,

15:09.778 --> 15:11.911
as easily as turning your head.

15:11.954 --> 15:16.045
Until you get to a point
that you remember the future.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.830
Remember the future...
remember the future...

15:23.618 --> 15:24.619
[Nicte chuckles]

15:28.014 --> 15:29.929
[Abigail]
Ever think you'd miss
the food at Fort Salem?

15:29.972 --> 15:31.104
[Tally chuckles]

15:31.800 --> 15:34.672
I know this is not your
favorite topic of conversation,

15:34.716 --> 15:37.023
but Nicte brought up
changing our appearances again.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.807
Why are you spending
so much time with her?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.243
Trying to get her to train me.

15:40.287 --> 15:42.376
I want to be ready
for what we're up against.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.638
We will be.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.509
No go on the face changing.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.903
Wouldn't it be better
in case something goes down

15:47.947 --> 15:50.253
-for all these people--
-Spree Work's not an option
for me, Tal.

15:50.297 --> 15:51.776
Sounds like
you're deciding for me.

15:52.429 --> 15:54.692
I know we're not at
Fort Salem anymore

15:54.736 --> 15:56.303
and I'm trying really,
really hard

15:56.346 --> 15:58.261
to adjust to our
new reality here.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.002
But, Tally, there have to be
some things

16:00.046 --> 16:02.352
you just don't judge on,
or it's all awash.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.006
I know, but with Silver
turning up the heat--

16:04.050 --> 16:05.529
Can we please talk
about something else?

16:11.709 --> 16:13.015
Did you ask Mac about
calling your mom?

16:14.060 --> 16:16.453
They're paranoid about
the phone lines, which I get--

16:16.497 --> 16:18.412
Hey! Petra knows we're okay,

16:19.543 --> 16:22.546
Scylla and Anacostia check in,
I'm sure--

16:22.590 --> 16:24.331
It's not the same,
getting it second-hand.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.768
I need to know what's going on,

16:26.811 --> 16:28.378
how long we have to hide here.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.077
I need her to tell me
what to do.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.081
Which is really funny
considering how much

16:35.124 --> 16:36.908
I usually try to avoid that.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.566
They won't let Abigail
call her mom.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.700
Now they won't let me call
my dad either.

16:45.743 --> 16:46.831
Quinn's caught him up.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.094
I can have him call base.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.530
I just need to talk to my mom.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.010
-All right. Hey.
-[door opens]

16:52.054 --> 16:54.013
[indistinct chatter]

16:56.972 --> 16:58.017
[chuckles]

17:02.369 --> 17:03.413
Oh! [chuckles]

17:05.850 --> 17:07.200
Everybody, this is Vira.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.769
Vira and I used to run
together before I conscripted.

17:11.813 --> 17:14.076
Oh, is that what we did?

17:14.120 --> 17:15.382
I didn't know
that was called running.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.342
Well, if it isn't
the most wanted soldiers

17:19.386 --> 17:21.910
in dead Alder's
soon-to-be defunct Army.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.085
Hi, Vira.

17:23.868 --> 17:25.087
Abigail Bellweather.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.654
Oh, I--I know,
I met you last night

17:26.697 --> 17:28.003
with the rest of the country.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.787
You guys were all over the TV.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.616
What In the name of the Goddess,

17:32.660 --> 17:34.357
are you still doing
wearing those faces?

17:35.097 --> 17:36.403
You might
want to strongly consider

17:36.446 --> 17:37.752
minding your own business.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.667
[scoffs] I'm serious.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.496
Everybody's looking for you
out there,

17:42.539 --> 17:45.238
Which is why
they're staying put in here.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.153
Until it's safe for them
to move on.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.719
Okay, I'm just saying

17:48.763 --> 17:50.112
what every Dodger
in this place is thinking.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.027
[sighs]

17:52.723 --> 17:54.812
Speaking of faces...

17:56.945 --> 17:57.989
Oh.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.079
It's been too long.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.908
You guys, it's a reunion.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.129
Is there some place
we can talk?

18:07.173 --> 18:09.044
-Sure.
-Okay.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.224
Let's go over here.

18:20.229 --> 18:21.926
That bitch
just ate my tomato.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.410
We're gonna need more of those.

18:29.456 --> 18:33.286
-You are insatiable.
-[Kara] Okay, back to drilling.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.766
[Silver]
Uh, that's a little bit
later, isn't it?

18:36.637 --> 18:37.420
[Kara] Focus.

18:38.508 --> 18:41.511
I mean, we are talking about
$165 million

18:41.555 --> 18:44.862
of my family's unearned
inherited wealth, after all.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.735
For six drill bits

18:47.778 --> 18:50.129
and a few hundred
thousand gallons
of fungicides, so...

18:52.740 --> 18:54.481
Here's hoping it works.

18:54.524 --> 18:55.482
It will.

18:58.398 --> 19:01.401
Ah, Alban Hearst in the flesh.

19:02.315 --> 19:05.318
[Kara] Alby, you're looking
entirely too well.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.407
That guy was part of the crew.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.973
The one that
signed on to base twice?

19:09.844 --> 19:10.845
None other.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.072
[scoffs]

19:21.638 --> 19:23.379
Oh. They're coming back.

19:24.424 --> 19:25.860
[Vira]
Sorry I was such a bitch.

19:25.903 --> 19:28.297
[chuckles]
Vira's short for Virago.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.212
It's like my mom knew.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.953
Hm.

19:31.996 --> 19:33.476
[Vira] Anyway,
I won't mention this again,

19:33.520 --> 19:35.478
but the face thing...

19:36.044 --> 19:39.047
doesn't hurt and it's
pretty easy to learn.

19:39.874 --> 19:41.745
-Hey, uh, where are you going?
-To find Adil.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.189
So, Vira and crew
are taking off.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.668
Yeah, no offense, we just--

19:51.712 --> 19:53.235
we don't need
this kind of heat right now.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.237
I mean, you guys and Batan?

19:55.281 --> 19:56.586
Yeah.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.894
Uh, wish you well though,
for real.

19:59.937 --> 20:02.853
Yeah, it's going to be
tough to see you go.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.116
You're so sweet.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.423
I'm sorry we didn't
get the chance to hang out.

20:09.338 --> 20:10.818
Come-- okay.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.653
[indistinct chatter]

20:20.784 --> 20:21.611
Try to make it quick.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.237
[device whirring]

20:45.418 --> 20:46.549
[device whirring]

20:59.432 --> 21:00.737
Mom, hi.

21:01.564 --> 21:03.131
-We need to go.
-What?

21:03.174 --> 21:04.480
Now. Come on.

21:14.229 --> 21:18.320
[device whirring]

21:40.647 --> 21:43.606
Back to Silver.
Mining equipment.

21:43.650 --> 21:47.523
industrial fungicide
and a mysterious benefactress.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.220
It's a lot to untangle.

21:50.004 --> 21:51.222
We'll know more soon.

21:51.701 --> 21:52.876
But I'm certain this
is about the mycelium.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.356
My gut says the same.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.836
If only more than that.

21:55.879 --> 21:57.403
Surveillance has been
compromised

21:57.446 --> 21:59.361
from some new sort of dampener
they're employing.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.320
Ah, the latest Camarilla toy.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.625
Yeah,
but I'll find a workaround.

22:04.888 --> 22:07.326
Do you know where Wade is
on a geneological initiative?

22:07.369 --> 22:08.979
She's not blocking.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.372
[Petra]
I need you to get closer.

22:10.416 --> 22:11.591
You need to see if they got her.

22:11.634 --> 22:12.592
Understood.

22:16.247 --> 22:17.466
How did Abigail sound?

22:20.295 --> 22:21.992
Exhausted. Scared.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.604
Hard to say, it was so short.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.434
Civilian authorities
are hunting them.

22:28.912 --> 22:31.654
Military police as well, but
our people have been instructed

22:31.698 --> 22:33.656
to contact me
at the moment they find her.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.397
If they find her.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.573
-They haven't
made any progress.
-That's good.

22:39.053 --> 22:40.446
Means they're staying
well hidden.

22:49.455 --> 22:50.543
[Petra] I miss her, too.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.329
[chuckles]
Does that surprise you?

22:56.287 --> 22:57.288
Not at all.

22:58.246 --> 22:59.682
It's time for her to move on.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.684
But not like that.

23:05.471 --> 23:06.820
What else have you learned?

23:08.169 --> 23:10.519
We have a name. Alban Hearst.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.216
He was on base the night of
the attack.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.044
[Petra] I met that monster.

23:14.088 --> 23:16.090
He was the one in charge,
said something ominous

23:16.133 --> 23:17.178
about Abigail and Adil.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.015
You guys left.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.670
They could kick us out
for this, Abs.

23:30.713 --> 23:32.062
Where are we gonna go?

23:32.106 --> 23:33.934
I tried to find out
what's going on back on base

23:33.977 --> 23:36.284
and in DC with
the charges against us.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.851
We had to cut it short.

23:37.894 --> 23:40.114
-[Raelle] What happened?
-There was a protest.

23:40.157 --> 23:41.550
Not Our Daughters.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.030
[Abigail] Cops were
checking people's faces

23:43.073 --> 23:44.597
with this weird flashlight.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.033
Checking for Work.

23:47.643 --> 23:48.731
They're getting closer.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.436
You ready to let go of
all that cuteness for a while?

23:57.479 --> 23:59.960
Abigail and Raelle
aren't budging. [grunts]

24:09.491 --> 24:11.493
And you do you
need the permission?

24:11.537 --> 24:12.581
No.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.367
But we decide things together

24:16.411 --> 24:18.326
and it usually ends up
being better than anything

24:18.369 --> 24:19.632
we would decide on our own.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.069
Bad choice, Red.

24:39.608 --> 24:40.957
[Tally grunts]

24:41.001 --> 24:42.698
You should have
seen that coming.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.047
It's getting better.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.484
[grunting]

24:46.528 --> 24:47.573
[exclaims]

24:49.313 --> 24:51.228
Keep looking.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.361
Not just two moves ahead.

24:53.404 --> 24:54.971
How about five moves ahead?

24:55.363 --> 24:56.843
I need you to see
the end of the fight

24:56.886 --> 24:59.498
when we're at the bar
afterwards, having a good time.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.456
-having a good time.
-Is this what you want?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.979
[gasps, grunts]

25:05.591 --> 25:06.722
[grunts]

25:10.334 --> 25:12.336
[gasps]

25:14.643 --> 25:16.602
Does anybody
know any Mothertongue?

25:18.647 --> 25:20.562
Why don't we learn
how to say Mothertongue

25:20.606 --> 25:22.042
in Mothertongue as a start?

25:23.783 --> 25:25.567
Menishe.

25:25.611 --> 25:28.265
-[all] Menishe.
-Very good.

25:28.309 --> 25:31.530
The story of our language
is as old as people.

25:31.573 --> 25:36.099
Long ago, six sisters
embarked on a sacred mission

25:36.143 --> 25:37.797
to bring the
power of speech to man.

25:40.451 --> 25:44.760
This common tongue is the root
of all the world's languages.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.639
[panting]

25:54.074 --> 25:55.597
Thanks for making the time.

25:55.641 --> 25:56.772
Of course.

26:02.473 --> 26:03.257
What's on your mind?

26:04.127 --> 26:06.477
Sehkmet was my first coven.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.611
And now half of them are dead,

26:09.655 --> 26:11.918
and most of the other
half are fugitives, so...

26:13.136 --> 26:15.312
It would be fair to say
I'm feeling...

26:17.401 --> 26:19.229
A little directionless

26:19.273 --> 26:22.624
and could really use
a new challenge.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.061
Thank you for being candid.

26:27.673 --> 26:31.328
Your conduct during the attack
was exemplary by the way.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.200
Thank you.

26:33.243 --> 26:34.636
I took this meeting as
an opportunity to

26:34.680 --> 26:37.334
review your transcript
from War College.

26:37.378 --> 26:40.642
You had exceptional marks
and physical infiltration.

26:40.686 --> 26:41.991
Yes, ma'am.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.559
Shame to waste such
a spectacular talent.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.784
[indistinct chatter]

27:05.667 --> 27:06.886
Hey, Shelby.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.365
Hey, Dwight.

27:08.757 --> 27:10.498
I really like your vest.

27:10.541 --> 27:11.978
It's the same one you have.

27:12.848 --> 27:13.893
Yeah.

27:15.155 --> 27:19.246
But on you, wow,
you look so pretty.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.465
Well, thank you, Dwight.

27:21.509 --> 27:23.206
The things you say are...

27:24.120 --> 27:26.340
very romantic in nature.

27:26.383 --> 27:27.907
Ah, I mean, you better stop it,

27:27.950 --> 27:29.082
you're making me
feel shy, Shelby.

27:29.604 --> 27:30.997
[laughs] No.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.390
But you're so outgoing.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.653
Well, here's the thing, Shelby.

27:36.306 --> 27:39.919
my feelings for you
are growing every day.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.790
And sometimes...

27:42.399 --> 27:44.314
I don't feel like
I can hold them in.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.012
Why is that?

27:46.055 --> 27:47.927
Because you're
Corn Queen of Aberdeen County.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.452
[laughs] Yes, I am.

27:53.236 --> 27:55.761
Ah, But, Dwight,
I feel the same way about you.

27:55.804 --> 27:56.979
Good.

27:57.893 --> 28:00.243
Because I think it's time
for us to start a family.

28:01.114 --> 28:01.941
Wait.

28:02.942 --> 28:04.552
[indistinct chatter]

28:05.161 --> 28:06.554
Are you being Dwight still?

28:07.773 --> 28:09.035
Kinda.

28:11.428 --> 28:13.213
Well, uh, Shelby--

28:13.256 --> 28:15.128
Shelby doesn't
know how to feel about that.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.826
What about Abigail?

28:17.870 --> 28:19.610
[sub-sonic alarm blares]

28:27.053 --> 28:28.968
My supervisor
should be out any moment.

28:30.447 --> 28:32.754
Look, we just need to
do a quick walkthrough.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.016
We received a complaint.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.367
That's the cop
who almost got us.

28:37.846 --> 28:41.328
I don't mean to be rude, but we
don't have a lot of time here.

28:41.371 --> 28:43.373
Can someone show us
how you get up to the roof?

28:44.113 --> 28:46.246
Somebody saw somebody
messing around up there.

28:46.768 --> 28:47.769
We'll be in and out.

28:55.951 --> 29:00.086
Hey, officers. Oh, you look
like you could use some coffee.

29:00.129 --> 29:01.565
We'll make a pit stop
on the way to the roof.

29:01.609 --> 29:03.176
That won't be necessary.

29:03.567 --> 29:06.570
-Lead the way.
-Wonderful. Follow me.

29:14.448 --> 29:15.754
[supervisor]
This is one of our busiest

29:15.797 --> 29:17.973
distribution centers
in the region,

29:18.017 --> 29:21.107
processing over 16 tons
of paper every quarter.

29:21.150 --> 29:23.805
We distribute your everyday
office paper,

29:23.849 --> 29:26.112
paper for the food service
and medical industries.

29:26.155 --> 29:27.722
That's a whole lot of paper.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.550
Any vandalism?

29:29.593 --> 29:30.812
Anybody hanging around
when they shouldn't be?

29:30.856 --> 29:32.901
No, sir.
We run a pretty tight ship.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.903
Twenty-four hour guards.
We don't get a lot of that.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.907
[indistinct chatter]

29:58.840 --> 30:02.409
[device whirring]

30:20.819 --> 30:22.864
Well, the coast is clear.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.953
You let us know
if you see anybody.

30:24.997 --> 30:27.695
Will do! How 'bout
some coffee for the road?

30:27.738 --> 30:29.828
-Next time.
-[scoffs]

30:49.586 --> 30:52.067
I go for a food run and
there's cops when I get back?

30:52.111 --> 30:53.242
They were just
checking a complaint.

30:53.286 --> 30:54.809
What kind of complaint?

30:54.853 --> 30:56.419
Well, they saw someone
on the roof.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.857
It was me.
I was training on the roof.

30:58.900 --> 31:01.555
Training to be stupid
and careless?

31:01.598 --> 31:03.035
Because I think you made it.

31:03.078 --> 31:05.385
--It gets worse.
It always does.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.256
One of the cops
had some device.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.911
Camarillo attack.
I'm guessing Dave's work.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.782
He saw past the bulletin board.

31:12.566 --> 31:13.523
All of the beds.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.090
[sighs]

31:17.223 --> 31:21.227
And we took a huge risk
hiding you and your friends.

31:21.270 --> 31:22.315
I can't do that again.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.535
I wish you all well,
but you're on your own.

31:26.188 --> 31:28.799
This place is burned,
we're on the move.

31:30.845 --> 31:33.326
-That was reckless.
-Scyll, easy.

31:33.369 --> 31:34.588
There's nothing
easy about this.

31:41.682 --> 31:43.510
[clamoring]

31:52.954 --> 31:54.782
I need you to be strong.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.915
What if the next place
is better than this one?

31:57.916 --> 32:01.920
Unlikely. The place before
this was an old grain silo

32:01.963 --> 32:03.530
full of rotting sorghum
and there were bugs

32:03.573 --> 32:04.879
in my sleeping bag.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.750
This place was nice.

32:06.794 --> 32:09.710
We had bathrooms, the kitchen,

32:10.363 --> 32:11.755
and we even had
school some days.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.192
I know.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.675
You know what I learned
from all the running

32:18.719 --> 32:19.938
I did when I was a kid?

32:21.026 --> 32:23.942
Is that home isn't a place.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.684
-It's the people you love.
-Maybe.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.558
But your friends remember
what we have here

32:31.601 --> 32:33.647
and now we have
to run for our lives.

32:33.690 --> 32:34.996
[Mac]
We need to leave now!

32:37.216 --> 32:38.652
Come on, guys, focus.

32:42.612 --> 32:43.831
Yeah, um...

32:53.884 --> 32:54.929
Seatbelts, everybody.

32:59.673 --> 33:00.935
Silver and Hearst
just walked in.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.154
We need to know what
they're planning

33:02.893 --> 33:04.417
and how much of Wade's
cabinet has been compromised.

33:05.244 --> 33:06.854
This place is stacked
with dampeners

33:06.897 --> 33:08.203
Roof's the only access
to ventilation.

33:08.987 --> 33:09.857
That's what you have me for.

33:11.424 --> 33:12.903
They just cleared the lobby.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.470
-You have less than two minutes.
-Already gone.

33:18.213 --> 33:20.259
[vocalizing]

33:30.138 --> 33:32.575
There, the inoculation
is complete.

â™ª Thou heartâ™ª

[Penelope] I suppose
it's a little late for me.

34:47.824 --> 34:49.696
[pants]

35:18.159 --> 35:20.118
[Hearst]
We all know the truth

35:20.161 --> 35:23.773
that witches are the enemy
of all that is good,

35:23.817 --> 35:26.298
wholesome and natural.

35:26.341 --> 35:27.951
[all] Hear, hear.

35:27.995 --> 35:30.302
But even in our wildest,

35:30.345 --> 35:32.608
darkest dreams,
we couldn't imagine.

35:32.652 --> 35:35.002
Ah, wait, that depends on
who's dreaming.

35:35.045 --> 35:36.699
Because I happen to know
that you...

35:37.613 --> 35:39.615
Alban dear,
are particularly dark.

35:40.225 --> 35:41.661
[laughter]

35:43.053 --> 35:44.620
Dark enough
to get the job done.

35:44.664 --> 35:45.795
[Kara]
Don't know about that.

35:46.492 --> 35:49.059
I think Blanton has earned
that more than you.

35:51.236 --> 35:52.672
We've discovered...

35:53.281 --> 35:56.110
That their influence has
spread deeper than we thought.

35:56.850 --> 36:00.114
There is rot in the land.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.420
An Abscess.

36:03.422 --> 36:07.034
Neither plant nor animal,
sucking the strength

36:07.077 --> 36:10.168
and nourishment from
this Earth and these...

36:13.258 --> 36:15.085
craven mongrels...

36:17.218 --> 36:18.611
call this thing...

36:20.830 --> 36:21.788

36:23.659 --> 36:26.096
Our scholars believe it to
be the source of their power.

36:26.880 --> 36:29.448
I'll be personally overseeing
the drilling operations.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.885
As well as the administration
of the poison.

36:31.928 --> 36:33.408
And with my work on the hill.

36:33.452 --> 36:35.410
And thanks to my
fundraising efforts.

36:35.889 --> 36:37.543
We have secured...

36:38.761 --> 36:39.719
their end.

36:42.939 --> 36:45.028
[applause continues]

37:04.657 --> 37:05.919
Hey.

37:07.790 --> 37:09.009
Tal, it's okay.

37:09.705 --> 37:11.141
Oh, if you ever need anyone
to ruin everything,

37:11.185 --> 37:12.317
I am available.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.014
-[Abigail] Tal--
-No, seriously.

37:14.057 --> 37:16.190
Alder, Penelope, now this?

37:17.800 --> 37:20.281
I may just be the Camarilla's
greatest weapon.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.196
Whoa, Tally.

37:22.588 --> 37:26.026
I broke the rules, too. Okay?
I just didn't get caught.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.074
[Scylla]
Sorry I came down
on you before.

37:31.118 --> 37:32.293
Mac's an old friend.

37:32.685 --> 37:33.947
I was frustrated.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.210
What's next back there?
An pillow fight?

37:37.603 --> 37:39.082
Just drive, Batan.

37:43.086 --> 37:45.088
Nice job with the cops earlier.

37:45.132 --> 37:47.090
"Can I get you guys
some coffee for the road?"

37:48.178 --> 37:49.223
Thanks.

37:50.746 --> 37:53.662
I know Spree Work
is a sore subject for you,

37:53.706 --> 37:57.057
but I know a way you
could actually see your mom.

38:00.582 --> 38:03.977
â™ª Everything's slow motion

38:04.020 --> 38:07.067

38:07.894 --> 38:11.593
â™ª I'm not sure of
Anything anymore â™ª

38:12.768 --> 38:16.206
â™ª I think I know
What this is for â™ª

38:18.818 --> 38:20.080
[Abigail] Mom?

38:23.736 --> 38:24.606
Mom, are you there?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.784
Abigail.
Where's next?

38:28.828 --> 38:30.569
Raelle can get us
into the Cession.

38:31.221 --> 38:32.788
We'll get lost for a while

38:32.832 --> 38:34.007
and wind up in Norcal
in a few weeks.

38:35.182 --> 38:37.053
When are we
gonna be exonerated?

38:37.097 --> 38:38.054
That's still complicated.

38:39.229 --> 38:41.754
The Camarilla infiltration is
more widespread than we thought.

38:41.797 --> 38:43.495
It's still not safe
to turn you over.

38:44.670 --> 38:45.888
I'm so tired.

38:46.759 --> 38:47.847
Mom.

38:53.418 --> 38:54.549
I know.

38:55.463 --> 38:57.639
But rely on your unit.
They have your back.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.343
There's something else.
One of the Camarilla

39:05.386 --> 39:07.127
said something
about you and Adil.

39:07.606 --> 39:09.695
and preventing the
Union of Earth and Sky.

39:09.738 --> 39:11.305
The what?

39:11.349 --> 39:13.046
Bellweathers are known
for Weatherwork.

39:13.089 --> 39:14.830
the Tarim is known
for Earthwork...

39:15.483 --> 39:17.180
-It's about our Work.
-I don't know.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.924
-Or the other kind of union.
-Entirely possible.

39:21.968 --> 39:23.404
-That's crazy
because Adil just--
-[knocking on door]

39:25.014 --> 39:26.929
-Adil what?
-I have to go.

39:26.973 --> 39:28.801
-Be careful.
-We will.

39:28.844 --> 39:30.803
May the Goddess protect you.
I love you, daughter.

39:30.846 --> 39:32.152
