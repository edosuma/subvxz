This kind of Seeing
can mess you up.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.756
Try me.

14:47.799 --> 14:48.931
[grunts]

14:49.410 --> 14:51.934
Look behind your eyes.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.546
Find the source of your Sight.

14:57.374 --> 15:01.204
Not your eyes,
or your nerves, or your brain.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.208
I'm talking about
the observer herself.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.907
This inner gaze can
be aimed forward

15:07.950 --> 15:09.734
and back in time,

15:09.778 --> 15:11.911
as easily as turning your head.

15:11.954 --> 15:16.045
Until you get to a point
that you remember the future.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.830
Remember the future...
remember the future...

15:23.618 --> 15:24.619
[Nicte chuckles]

15:28.014 --> 15:29.929
[Abigail]
Ever think you'd miss
the food at Fort Salem?

15:29.972 --> 15:31.104
[Tally chuckles]

15:31.800 --> 15:34.672
I know this is not your
favorite topic of conversation,

15:34.716 --> 15:37.023
but Nicte brought up
changing our appearances again.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.807
Why are you spending
so much time with her?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.243
Trying to get her to train me.

15:40.287 --> 15:42.376
I want to be ready
for what we're up against.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.638
We will be.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.509
No go on the face changing.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.903
Wouldn't it be better
in case something goes down

15:47.947 --> 15:50.253
-for all these people--
-Spree Work's not an option
for me, Tal.

15:50.297 --> 15:51.776
Sounds like
you're deciding for me.

15:52.429 --> 15:54.692
I know we're not at
Fort Salem anymore

15:54.736 --> 15:56.303
and I'm trying really,
really hard

15:56.346 --> 15:58.261
to adjust to our
new reality here.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.002
But, Tally, there have to be
some things

16:00.046 --> 16:02.352
you just don't judge on,
or it's all awash.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.006
I know, but with Silver
turning up the heat--

16:04.050 --> 16:05.529
Can we please talk
about something else?

16:11.709 --> 16:13.015
Did you ask Mac about
calling your mom?

16:14.060 --> 16:16.453
They're paranoid about
the phone lines, which I get--

16:16.497 --> 16:18.412
Hey! Petra knows we're okay,

16:19.543 --> 16:22.546
Scylla and Anacostia check in,
I'm sure--

16:22.590 --> 16:24.331
It's not the same,
getting it second-hand.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.768
I need to know what's going on,

16:26.811 --> 16:28.378
how long we have to hide here.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.077
I need her to tell me
what to do.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.081
Which is really funny
considering how much

16:35.124 --> 16:36.908
I usually try to avoid that.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.566
They won't let Abigail
call her mom.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.700
Now they won't let me call
my dad either.

16:45.743 --> 16:46.831
Quinn's caught him up.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.094
I can have him call base.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.530
I just need to talk to my mom.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.010
-All right. Hey.
-[door opens]

16:52.054 --> 16:54.013
[indistinct chatter]

16:56.972 --> 16:58.017
[chuckles]

17:02.369 --> 17:03.413
Oh! [chuckles]

17:05.850 --> 17:07.200
Everybody, this is Vira.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.769
Vira and I used to run
together before I conscripted.

17:11.813 --> 17:14.076
Oh, is that what we did?

17:14.120 --> 17:15.382
I didn't know
that was called running.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.342
Well, if it isn't
the most wanted soldiers

17:19.386 --> 17:21.910
in dead Alder's
soon-to-be defunct Army.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.085
Hi, Vira.

17:23.868 --> 17:25.087
Abigail Bellweather.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.654
Oh, I--I know,
I met you last night

17:26.697 --> 17:28.003
with the rest of the country.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.787
You guys were all over the TV.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.616
What In the name of the Goddess,

17:32.660 --> 17:34.357
are you still doing
wearing those faces?

17:35.097 --> 17:36.403
You might
want to strongly consider

17:36.446 --> 17:37.752
minding your own business.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.667
[scoffs] I'm serious.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.496
Everybody's looking for you
out there,

17:42.539 --> 17:45.238
Which is why
they're staying put in here.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.153
Until it's safe for them
to move on.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.719
Okay, I'm just saying

17:48.763 --> 17:50.112
what every Dodger
in this place is thinking.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.027
[sighs]

17:52.723 --> 17:54.812
Speaking of faces...

17:56.945 --> 17:57.989
Oh.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.079
It's been too long.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.908
You guys, it's a reunion.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.129
Is there some place
we can talk?

18:07.173 --> 18:09.044
-Sure.
-Okay.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.224
Let's go over here.

18:20.229 --> 18:21.926
That bitch
just ate my tomato.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.410
We're gonna need more of those.

18:29.456 --> 18:33.286
-You are insatiable.
-[Kara] Okay, back to drilling.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.766
[Silver]
Uh, that's a little bit
later, isn't it?

18:36.637 --> 18:37.420
[Kara] Focus.

18:38.508 --> 18:41.511
I mean, we are talking about
$165 million

18:41.555 --> 18:44.862
of my family's unearned
inherited wealth, after all.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.735
For six drill bits

18:47.778 --> 18:50.129
and a few hundred
thousand gallons
of fungicides, so...

18:52.740 --> 18:54.481
Here's hoping it works.

18:54.524 --> 18:55.482
It will.

18:58.398 --> 19:01.401
Ah, Alban Hearst in the flesh.

19:02.315 --> 19:05.318
[Kara] Alby, you're looking
entirely too well.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.407
That guy was part of the crew.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.973
The one that
signed on to base twice?

19:09.844 --> 19:10.845
None other.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.072
[scoffs]

19:21.638 --> 19:23.379
Oh. They're coming back.

19:24.424 --> 19:25.860
[Vira]
Sorry I was such a bitch.

19:25.903 --> 19:28.297
[chuckles]
Vira's short for Virago.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.212
It's like my mom knew.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.953
Hm.

19:31.996 --> 19:33.476
[Vira] Anyway,
I won't mention this again,

19:33.520 --> 19:35.478
but the face thing...

19:36.044 --> 19:39.047
doesn't hurt and it's
pretty easy to learn.

19:39.874 --> 19:41.745
-Hey, uh, where are you going?
-To find Adil.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.189
So, Vira and crew
are taking off.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.668
Yeah, no offense, we just--

19:51.712 --> 19:53.235
we don't need
this kind of heat right now.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.237
I mean, you guys and Batan?

19:55.281 --> 19:56.586
Yeah.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.894
Uh, wish you well though,
for real.

19:59.937 --> 20:02.853
Yeah, it's going to be
tough to see you go.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.116
You're so sweet.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.423
I'm sorry we didn't
get the chance to hang out.

20:09.338 --> 20:10.818
Come-- okay.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.653
[indistinct chatter]

20:20.784 --> 20:21.611
Try to make it quick.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.237
[device whirring]

20:45.418 --> 20:46.549
[device whirring]

20:59.432 --> 21:00.737
Mom, hi.

21:01.564 --> 21:03.131
-We need to go.
-What?

21:03.174 --> 21:04.480
Now. Come on.

21:14.229 --> 21:18.320
[device whirring]

21:40.647 --> 21:43.606
Back to Silver.
Mining equipment.

21:43.650 --> 21:47.523
industrial fungicide
and a mysterious benefactress.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.220
It's a lot to untangle.

21:50.004 --> 21:51.222
We'll know more soon.

21:51.701 --> 21:52.876
But I'm certain this
is about the mycelium.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.356
My gut says the same.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.836
If only more than that.

21:55.879 --> 21:57.403
Surveillance has been
compromised

21:57.446 --> 21:59.361
from some new sort of dampener
they're employing.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.320
Ah, the latest Camarilla toy.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.625
Yeah,
but I'll find a workaround.

22:04.888 --> 22:07.326
Do you know where Wade is
on a geneological initiative?

22:07.369 --> 22:08.979
She's not blocking.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.372
[Petra]
I need you to get closer.

22:10.416 --> 22:11.591
You need to see if they got her.

22:11.634 --> 22:12.592
Understood.

22:16.247 --> 22:17.466
How did Abigail sound?

22:20.295 --> 22:21.992
Exhausted. Scared.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.604
Hard to say, it was so short.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.434
Civilian authorities
are hunting them.

22:28.912 --> 22:31.654
Military police as well, but
our people have been instructed

22:31.698 --> 22:33.656
to contact me
at the moment they find her.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.397
If they find her.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.573
-They haven't
made any progress.
-That's good.

22:39.053 --> 22:40.446
Means they're staying
well hidden.

22:49.455 --> 22:50.543
[Petra] I miss her, too.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.329
[chuckles]
Does that surprise you?

22:56.287 --> 22:57.288
Not at all.

22:58.246 --> 22:59.682
It's time for her to move on.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.684
But not like that.

23:05.471 --> 23:06.820
What else have you learned?

23:08.169 --> 23:10.519
We have a name. Alban Hearst.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.216
He was on base the night of
the attack.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.044
[Petra] I met that monster.

23:14.088 --> 23:16.090
He was the one in charge,
said something ominous

23:16.133 --> 23:17.178
about Abigail and Adil.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.015
You guys left.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.670
They could kick us out
for this, Abs.

23:30.713 --> 23:32.062
Where are we gonna go?

23:32.106 --> 23:33.934
I tried to find out
what's going on back on base

23:33.977 --> 23:36.284
and in DC with
the charges against us.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.851
We had to cut it short.

23:37.894 --> 23:40.114
-[Raelle] What happened?
-There was a protest.

23:40.157 --> 23:41.550
Not Our Daughters.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.030
[Abigail] Cops were
checking people's faces

23:43.073 --> 23:44.597
with this weird flashlight.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.033
Checking for Work.

23:47.643 --> 23:48.731
They're getting closer.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.436
You ready to let go of
all that cuteness for a while?

23:57.479 --> 23:59.960
Abigail and Raelle
aren't budging. [grunts]

24:09.491 --> 24:11.493
And you do you
need the permission?

24:11.537 --> 24:12.581
No.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.367
But we decide things together

24:16.411 --> 24:18.326
and it usually ends up
being better than anything

24:18.369 --> 24:19.632
we would decide on our own.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.069
Bad choice, Red.

24:39.608 --> 24:40.957
[Tally grunts]

24:41.001 --> 24:42.698
You should have
seen that coming.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.047
It's getting better.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.484
[grunting]

24:46.528 --> 24:47.573
[exclaims]

24:49.313 --> 24:51.228
Keep looking.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.361
Not just two moves ahead.

24:53.404 --> 24:54.971
How about five moves ahead?

24:55.363 --> 24:56.843
I need you to see
the end of the fight

24:56.886 --> 24:59.498
when we're at the bar
afterwards, having a good time.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.456
-having a good time.
-Is this what you want?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.979
[gasps, grunts]

25:05.591 --> 25:06.722
[grunts]

25:10.334 --> 25:12.336
[gasps]

25:14.643 --> 25:16.602
Does anybody
know any Mothertongue?

25:18.647 --> 25:20.562
Why don't we learn
how to say Mothertongue

25:20.606 --> 25:22.042
in Mothertongue as a start?

25:23.783 --> 25:25.567
Menishe.

25:25.611 --> 25:28.265
-[all] Menishe.
-Very good.

25:28.309 --> 25:31.530
The story of our language
is as old as people.

25:31.573 --> 25:36.099
Long ago, six sisters
embarked on a sacred mission

25:36.143 --> 25:37.797
to bring the
power of speech to man.

25:40.451 --> 25:44.760
This common tongue is the root
of all the world's languages.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.639
[panting]

25:54.074 --> 25:55.597
Thanks for making the time.

25:55.641 --> 25:56.772
Of course.

26:02.473 --> 26:03.257
What's on your mind?

26:04.127 --> 26:06.477
Sehkmet was my first coven.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.611
And now half of them are dead,

26:09.655 --> 26:11.918
and most of the other
half are fugitives, so...

26:13.136 --> 26:15.312
It would be fair to say
I'm feeling...

26:17.401 --> 26:19.229
A little directionless

26:19.273 --> 26:22.624
and could really use
a new challenge.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.061
Thank you for being candid.

26:27.673 --> 26:31.328
Your conduct during the attack
was exemplary by the way.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.200
Thank you.

26:33.243 --> 26:34.636
I took this meeting as
an opportunity to

26:34.680 --> 26:37.334
review your transcript
from War College.

26:37.378 --> 26:40.642
You had exceptional marks
and physical infiltration.

26:40.686 --> 26:41.991
Yes, ma'am.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.559
Shame to waste such
a spectacular talent.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.784
[indistinct chatter]

27:05.667 --> 27:06.886
Hey, Shelby.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.365
Hey, Dwight.

27:08.757 --> 27:10.498
I really like your vest.

27:10.541 --> 27:11.978
It's the same one you have.

27:12.848 --> 27:13.893
Yeah.

27:15.155 --> 27:19.246
But on you, wow,
you look so pretty.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.465
Well, thank you, Dwight.

27:21.509 --> 27:23.206
The things you say are...

27:24.120 --> 27:26.340
very romantic in nature.

27:26.383 --> 27:27.907
Ah, I mean, you better stop it,

27:27.950 --> 27:29.082
you're making me
feel shy, Shelby.

27:29.604 --> 27:30.997
[laughs] No.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.390
But you're so outgoing.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.653
Well, here's the thing, Shelby.

27:36.306 --> 27:39.919
my feelings for you
are growing every day.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.790
And sometimes...

27:42.399 --> 27:44.314
I don't feel like
I can hold them in.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.012
