[groans]

10:11.319 --> 10:13.654
Oh, this isn't over, Grangers!

10:14.572 --> 10:18.576
Caterpillars usually spin their cocoons
high in trees. I bet there's some up here.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.119
Oh, Lucky,

10:20.202 --> 10:21.996
is there something hidden up there

10:22.079 --> 10:25.041
that could come spilling down on me
at any second?

10:25.833 --> 10:27.710
Nope, nothing. Let's keep looking.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.670
Oh.

10:29.754 --> 10:30.755
Are you sure?

10:31.380 --> 10:33.424
Oh! Should I look?

10:33.758 --> 10:35.176
Is that what you want me to do?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.887
No. Let's look somewhere else.

10:37.970 --> 10:38.971
Oh, yes!

10:39.055 --> 10:40.598
Let's look somewhere else.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.977
[Maricela giggles and snorts]

10:46.312 --> 10:47.396
Hm.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.689
Hm.

10:48.773 --> 10:49.857
Where could they be?

10:49.940 --> 10:50.941
Yes.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.026
Where?

10:52.735 --> 10:53.778
Over here?

10:53.861 --> 10:54.862
Or here?

10:55.363 --> 10:57.156
Or here? Am I getting warmer?

10:57.698 --> 10:59.075
-Colder?
-[Spirit snorts]

-What you got in there? Glue?
-Nope.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.050
[Pru] Mm-hm.

11:16.133 --> 11:19.720
And you wouldn't be putting mayonnaise
in my toothpaste again, would you?

11:20.012 --> 11:20.846
Nope.

11:23.682 --> 11:25.017
[Mr. Granger chuckles]

11:27.603 --> 11:28.604
[cackles]

11:29.146 --> 11:31.107
I'm glad my first prank didn't work,

11:31.190 --> 11:32.900
because this one's even better.

11:32.983 --> 11:35.403
They won't be able to take a step
without spilling!

Hm.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.078
-Oh, look!
-The rock?

11:44.495 --> 11:47.581
Yeah! I bet there are plenty
of caterpillars under there.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.375
Or plenty of giggles!

11:50.042 --> 11:51.627
I'll look. I can't wait...

11:51.710 --> 11:53.254
[grunts] ...to see...

11:53.337 --> 11:54.338
[grunts]

11:54.839 --> 11:56.048
...what's underneath.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.384

11:59.385 --> 12:00.386
go!

12:00.469 --> 12:01.929
[Maricela laughs]

12:02.012 --> 12:03.556
Oh, good one, Lucky!

12:04.056 --> 12:05.141
You got me!

12:05.224 --> 12:06.934
These will be great for the report.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.063
Wait, these are just bugs.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.399
Hmph! Lucky Prescott,

12:13.482 --> 12:15.651
why did you even bring me out here?

12:16.235 --> 12:18.529
Uh... To look for caterpillars...

12:18.612 --> 12:19.613
for school.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.907
And you expect me to believe that's all?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.534
Maricela, are you OK?

12:23.617 --> 12:25.744
Did you breathe in too much of
the stink-bomb smoke?

12:26.078 --> 12:28.372
Oh! Now you're insulting me?

12:28.831 --> 12:30.875
Lucky, you are being horrible!

12:31.417 --> 12:34.086
But you're the one who's mad at me
for no reason at all.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.171
No reason?

12:35.254 --> 12:36.505
[stammers]

12:36.589 --> 12:38.257
We're supposed to be friends!

12:39.925 --> 12:41.719
This is what friends do!

12:42.344 --> 12:43.637
April Fool's!

12:45.848 --> 12:47.516
What is wrong with you?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.018
Just... Just...

12:49.894 --> 12:52.688
Leave me alone!

13:04.200 --> 13:06.577
One for Pru, one for Mr. Granger.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.580
You know, Boomerang,
I'm glad I set off the other pranks,

13:09.663 --> 13:11.290
because this one's the best yet.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.667
The minute they walk through that door,

13:13.751 --> 13:14.919
ka-splat!

13:15.002 --> 13:16.045
It's perfect.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.047
[sighs] Almost perfect.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.150
Kate? What's wrong?

13:39.026 --> 13:41.487
[groans] I can't find my wedding ring.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.822
I've been looking for it all afternoon.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.491
It's got to be here somewhere.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.493
When was the last time you saw it?

13:47.576 --> 13:51.539
Um... I had it on yesterday
when I went for a stroll to the inn,

13:51.622 --> 13:54.375
and then I took it off in the kitchen
before we made the jam.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.835
[groans] Oh, it's just no use!

13:56.919 --> 13:58.754
I've turned this place upside down.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.381
I've looked everywhere!

14:01.465 --> 14:02.633
Everywhere?

14:04.134 --> 14:06.470
[Kate] Oh. Oh, no.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.183
We'll find your ring. Don't worry.

14:12.851 --> 14:13.852
Anything?

14:14.520 --> 14:15.521
[sighs]

14:18.524 --> 14:20.568
Hey, Dad. I need your help with something.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.153
Over here, in the barn.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.072
[Mr. Granger chuckles] That's funny.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.783
I need your help
with something in the barn.

14:31.453 --> 14:32.872
Hey, Abigail.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.081
What are you doing?

14:34.582 --> 14:35.958
[mutters] Surrendering.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.251
I surrender.

After all these years,

15:45.277 --> 15:47.696
I got you so good!

15:47.780 --> 15:49.448
Boomerang, did you see that?

15:51.575 --> 15:54.578
-Spirit, you hungry?
-[Spirit snorts]

15:54.662 --> 15:56.997
So, how did your project with Maricela go?

15:57.081 --> 15:58.374
[sighs] Horrible.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.250
I mean, it was fine at first,

16:00.334 --> 16:02.086
but Maricela started acting crazy,

16:02.169 --> 16:03.545
even for Maricela!

16:03.629 --> 16:05.089
She was talking nonsense,

16:05.172 --> 16:07.883
then she threw mud at me and ran away.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.551
She threw mud at you?

16:09.635 --> 16:10.678
Huh.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.180
Well, I know you girls
were pulling April Fool's pranks.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.890
But that's just it.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.935
I was being extra nice to her
by not pranking her.

16:18.018 --> 16:21.605
I got everyone else, but not Maricela,
because I knew she would hate it.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.023
[Lucky grunts]

16:23.107 --> 16:24.525
When I lived at the orphanage,

16:24.608 --> 16:26.568
some of the girls started
a knitting circle.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.238
I didn't like to knit,
so they didn't ask me to join.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.616
But that's when the girls
would talk and gossip,

16:32.700 --> 16:36.412
and guess what color the nuns' bloomers
were under their habits.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.915
They had a lot of fun and I felt left out.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.625
That's terrible.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.128
What color were they?

16:44.837 --> 16:45.879
I-I don't know.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.381
White, I suppose.

16:47.464 --> 16:50.843
Anyway, I wanted to belong,
but I didn't know how.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.469
I even bought needles and yarn

16:52.553 --> 16:56.056
and I tried to teach myself how to knit,
which was a disaster.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.143
One of the girls found me so tangled up
in my own knitting

16:59.226 --> 17:01.478
that it took us ten minutes
to set me free.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.439
That sounds awful.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.024
[groans] It was.

17:05.357 --> 17:09.111
But it made her realize how much
I wanted to be part of the group,

17:09.194 --> 17:11.405
so she invited me in.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.993
Oh, I get it.
Now you're great at knitting.

17:16.618 --> 17:17.745
Oh, no.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.371
I'm horrible. See?

17:21.373 --> 17:24.251
That's a really nice... elephant.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.128
Butterfly.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.672
But, no, you're missing my point.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.215
Which is...?

17:31.467 --> 17:34.136
[sighs] It's nice to feel included.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.345
And...?

17:36.722 --> 17:40.726
And I bet Maricela was asking
to join the fun in her own way.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.064
Maybe you're right. I guess she was.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.484
It's hard to imagine you being shy.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.778
Well, people change.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.780
That's true. Look at you and me.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.699
I mean, I never would have believed
if someone had told me

17:55.783 --> 17:57.117
you would be my mom one day.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.911
[chuckles] Me neither.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.039
But I'm so happy we're a family now.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.582
Me, too.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.000
OK, last jar.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.710
Your ring's got to be in this one.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.880
-It's not here.
-What?

18:09.963 --> 18:11.840
No! It's got to be!

18:11.924 --> 18:14.009
[groans] What am I going to tell Jim?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.928
Tell Jim about what? [gasps]

18:16.845 --> 18:19.098
Uh... A-About the raccoon

18:19.181 --> 18:22.142
that broke into our kitchen and, well...

18:22.226 --> 18:23.644
[sighs]

18:23.727 --> 18:25.104
I lost my wedding ring.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.440
I thought it was in one of the jars,
but we looked thorough them and--

18:28.524 --> 18:29.525
Oh.

18:29.858 --> 18:32.236
I uh... Uh-oh.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.529
What?

18:35.823 --> 18:36.824
[chuckles]

18:36.907 --> 18:37.950
April Fool's?

[gasps]

18:44.957 --> 18:46.166
[laughs]

18:49.253 --> 18:50.754
I admit it, you got me.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.757
This is never coming off again.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.176
Thank you for your help, Lucky.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.261
Anytime.

18:57.344 --> 19:00.097
[sighs] But now I better go fix things
with Maricela.

19:01.765 --> 19:05.144
You know, Kate, you're really good
at this whole mom thing.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.229
[door opens and shuts]

19:07.312 --> 19:08.480
[chuckles]

19:08.564 --> 19:10.607
I'm happy Lucky feels that way,

19:10.691 --> 19:14.069
because there's something else
I need to tell you.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.321
There were more raccoons? [laughs]

19:18.365 --> 19:19.783
Wait, were there actual raccoons?

19:20.492 --> 19:21.493
[chuckles] No.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.371
Jim...

19:25.205 --> 19:26.748
we're going to have a baby.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.711
[chuckles] Nice try.
April Fool's to you, too.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.966
Not April Fool's?

19:36.425 --> 19:37.426
No.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.052
Not April Fool's.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.846
You're going to be a father again.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.139
[gasps]

19:44.099 --> 19:45.100
[Kate gasps]

19:45.184 --> 19:46.602
[both laugh]

19:48.687 --> 19:49.938
[both grunting]

19:51.273 --> 19:52.608
What happened to you?

19:52.691 --> 19:54.109
Abigail got me good is what.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.277
I'm the Prank Queen.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.361
That's perfect,

19:56.445 --> 19:58.655
because we have one last prank to pull.

19:58.739 --> 20:02.326
The biggest, most sensational
April Fool's prank in the history of time.

20:02.409 --> 20:03.243
On who?

20:03.827 --> 20:04.828
Maricela!

20:04.912 --> 20:06.872
But Maricela hates pranks.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.499
Yeah, but people change.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.094
[scoffs]

20:21.178 --> 20:24.806
If you're here to deliver an apology
from Lucky, I don't accept.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.184
And, what, she couldn't even come herself?

20:27.267 --> 20:29.519
I thought she and I were friends,
but I guess I was wrong.

20:29.603 --> 20:30.854
[clears throat]

20:30.938 --> 20:34.024
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for my pre-dinner bubble bath.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.317
Fare-thee-well.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.569
[Abigail scoffs]

20:37.653 --> 20:38.654
What?

20:39.363 --> 20:41.782
Who said anything about talking?

20:42.324 --> 20:44.284
We want you to sing.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.328
Whoa! [grunts]

20:46.954 --> 20:50.874
[Abigail] Pru's so sad because she got
a bucket foot, so I said to myself,

20:50.958 --> 20:53.001
"Self, what would cheer Pru up?"

20:53.085 --> 20:56.964
And what would cheer her - anyone - up
more than you singing?

20:57.047 --> 20:58.966
-Right, Pru?
-Right.

21:00.175 --> 21:01.176
Fine.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.888
But know that my whole heart is not in it,
even though it will sound like it is.

Please sing another verse. Right, Pru?

21:35.627 --> 21:36.628
Oh, do.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.922
[chuckles] I can't wait.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.632
There's only the two verses.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.135
Never mind. I'll just sing it again.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.304
An encore. Don't worry, Pru.

I, Maricela Melena Gutierrez...

22:06.283 --> 22:07.284
am purple.

[laughter]

22:12.831 --> 22:14.333
Blackberry bubble bath.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.209
It worked! It really worked!

22:16.293 --> 22:18.295
[Lucky] Aw! Look how happy she is.

22:18.378 --> 22:19.880
I was pranked, too!

22:19.963 --> 22:22.090
Just like you all, but better.

April Fool's is officially done.

Yes, so hilarious!

22:28.055 --> 22:29.639
Oh, PALMs,

22:29.723 --> 22:32.017
this is a memory we'll share forever.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.603
But now that we've had our fun,

22:34.686 --> 22:35.937
never...

22:36.021 --> 22:37.189
ever...

22:37.272 --> 22:38.732
do that to me again.
