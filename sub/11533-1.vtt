01:28.463 --> 01:30.757
It's 24 floors. Never attempted.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.594
Which face? East. The hardest.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.179
Blindfolded, why not?

01:36.555 --> 01:37.639
Any questions?

01:38.640 --> 01:40.184
Be there at 6.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.952
Kamel!

02:01.580 --> 02:04.583
Come on! Get down here!

02:05.209 --> 02:05.667
You seen the time?

02:05.751 --> 02:08.377
They're doing Bleuets. No!

02:08.419 --> 02:10.589
Straight up. I saw them.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.798
C'mon! Be right there.

02:28.607 --> 02:29.566
It's gonna be great!

02:49.878 --> 02:52.381
Out of this world!

03:02.599 --> 03:03.642
Police?

03:06.728 --> 03:09.606
Unbelievable!

03:12.317 --> 03:12.943
I had a drink. Liar!

03:12.985 --> 03:14.820
I'm not.

03:15.279 --> 03:16.989
You saw that redhead!

03:17.364 --> 03:18.282
What redhead?

03:18.532 --> 03:19.449
I saw you. I followed you.

03:19.658 --> 03:20.659
Get off my case!

03:26.748 --> 03:27.833
That's class!

03:28.375 --> 03:30.377
Totally awesome!

04:13.295 --> 04:15.631
Once is enough.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.446
Here comes the cavalry.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.657
Too late, as usual.

04:41.865 --> 04:42.699
Let's go.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.285
Okay, move it!

04:49.706 --> 04:51.041
Move it, guys!

04:54.378 --> 04:55.712
No screw-ups this time!

04:55.879 --> 04:57.381
Bring them in!

04:57.506 --> 05:00.050
Go! Go! Go!

05:12.771 --> 05:16.441
Scram! Police operation.
Operetta, you mean!

05:16.525 --> 05:17.901
Get outta here.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.571
If we're too big for you, call for back-up.

05:20.696 --> 05:21.989
Come again?

05:22.614 --> 05:23.740
Let it go.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.534
Every morning, the same thing.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.789
Guys, over here! Come on!

05:32.040 --> 05:33.584
Let's get going, guys!

05:59.943 --> 06:00.903
Move it!

06:00.944 --> 06:03.405
GO GO GO GO GO!

06:03.447 --> 06:07.659
Come on, guys!

06:11.538 --> 06:12.372
Morning, boss.

06:13.332 --> 06:14.625
Enough is enough

06:14.875 --> 06:16.877
I like a joke but not on me!

06:19.588 --> 06:21.632
Everyone in here!

06:27.471 --> 06:28.972
Let's recap.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.935
YA-MA-KA-SI

06:32.976 --> 06:35.979
7 kids making fools of us.
We'll teach them.

06:36.688 --> 06:37.981
Let me introduce: Ousmane Dadjacan,

06:38.065 --> 06:39.024
a.k.a. Zicmu,

06:39.775 --> 06:43.111
Mister Music

07:07.719 --> 07:08.345
What now?

07:10.848 --> 07:12.432
What's wrong? Morning.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.017
Music's too loud. Come in.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.854
Sorry about this. Go ahead.

07:23.026 --> 07:23.986
On 3, we're coming in!

07:25.028 --> 07:26.989
1 ! 2! 3!

07:29.700 --> 07:31.952
Don't do that, kid... we're sorry...

07:32.578 --> 07:34.705
But the music's too loud.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.665
No!

07:37.583 --> 07:38.750
Police brutality!

07:40.627 --> 07:42.087
Not police brutality, police stupidity.

07:42.171 --> 07:45.924
Any more and I'll suspend you.

07:47.092 --> 07:47.926
Next up.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.430
Jean-Michel Lucas, a.k.a. Tango.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.519
You gotta see this. He's crazy

07:58.729 --> 08:00.063
OK, what's going on?

08:00.397 --> 08:01.899
Morning, Ms. Boutin!

08:03.025 --> 08:05.652
What's with you? I swear, he...

08:05.777 --> 08:09.114
OK, back to work and stop wasting my time.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.999
I'll stop him dancing.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.752
Fasten your belts, this is Abdou N'Goto,

08:21.835 --> 08:26.840
a.k.a. Rocket, as in speed not science.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.845
Forget it.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.933
We'll get him next time.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.614
You only make it worse.

08:50.781 --> 08:53.408
If ever I lay my hands on him...

08:53.492 --> 08:56.912
Talking of which,

08:57.579 --> 08:58.705
slipping between our fingers is

08:58.789 --> 09:01.875
Bruno Duris, a.k.a. Spider...

09:02.709 --> 09:04.711
Stop it, you'll crease my dress.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.047
Sorry...

09:10.092 --> 09:11.718
Can I walk you to work? Maybe.

09:11.802 --> 09:15.430
Go on...

09:34.533 --> 09:35.450
There's worse.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.202
Malik N'Diaye... Weasel.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.081
Girls, watch this!

09:43.458 --> 09:43.917
Salto...

09:45.085 --> 09:46.712
Check it out, girls!

09:50.048 --> 09:54.052
Guys, what are you doing?

09:54.136 --> 09:55.554
Put that back.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.598
Quit fooling.

10:00.893 --> 10:02.102
Pathetic.

10:03.687 --> 10:04.897
Go ahead and laugh.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.065
You won't find this one so funny.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.108
Baseball!

10:10.527 --> 10:12.613
Real name: Oliver Chen.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.499
Thief!

10:24.833 --> 10:27.211
Stop him!

10:40.974 --> 10:42.768
Wannabe heroes.

10:42.851 --> 10:43.685
They're not crooks.

10:43.727 --> 10:44.978
Scaling buildings is illegal.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.980
It's not stealing. It's killing time.

10:47.022 --> 10:50.067
By wasting ours?

10:51.109 --> 10:54.613
Why can't they just play soccer

10:54.696 --> 10:55.239
Iike everybody else? Sir...

10:55.489 --> 10:57.950
Enough!

10:58.033 --> 10:59.618
Our job is to keep the peace. You don't

10:59.743 --> 11:02.579
climb buildings, wake people at 6AM,

11:02.663 --> 11:05.999
and make fools of the police. Clear?

11:10.587 --> 11:11.797
Last but not least

11:11.964 --> 11:13.966
Ousmane Bana,

11:15.926 --> 11:18.220
a.k.a. Sitting Bull.

11:28.856 --> 11:31.024
C'mon, you're last again.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.044
One day, I'll see him fall.

11:51.879 --> 11:56.049
Japan had 7 Samurai
the U.S. had the Magnificent 7

11:56.133 --> 11:57.551
We have 7 pains in the ass.

11:57.843 --> 12:00.512
We're gonna show them
this city's not a zoo.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.139
This week! Or else I call in the big boys

12:02.222 --> 12:06.226
and it'll be a safari.

12:06.768 --> 12:07.769
So get going!

12:28.749 --> 12:31.960
Cousin! You bring good news?

12:32.252 --> 12:33.212
Good and bad. You got fired?

12:33.545 --> 12:34.796
Not yet. So what's the good news?

12:34.880 --> 12:37.299
That this isn't work.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.092
I'm here as a friend. Sounds bad.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.136
We had a meeting.
My boss has you guys in the cross hairs.

12:41.220 --> 12:44.014
Is that a compliment?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.725
You'll have to stop pulling your stunts.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.605
Take a trip to the Alps.

12:52.272 --> 12:57.027
You can do all the climbing you want.

12:59.780 --> 13:03.033
Why us? We don't cause any trouble.

13:03.242 --> 13:05.285
But you do! Think about the parents.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.204
What parents? The kids idolize you.

13:08.914 --> 13:12.292
They wanna be anti-cop rebels like you,

13:12.626 --> 13:14.253
but without training like you.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.588
When one of them falls, how will it feel?

13:16.713 --> 13:19.299
I'm a small-time cop.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.513
The power I have is tiny...infinitesimal.

13:24.596 --> 13:27.808
And being half-Arab, divide it by 2 again.

13:28.183 --> 13:34.606
If you don't help me, I can't help you.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.071
Come round tonight.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.949
My Ma's frying chicken. Sounds good?

13:45.617 --> 13:46.952
If your Mom's cooking...

13:47.786 --> 13:51.874
Djamel, let's pretend we're Yamakasi!

13:52.207 --> 13:55.544
Climb up here!

13:55.627 --> 13:57.004
I can't. My heart...

13:57.087 --> 13:59.256
That's to get out of gym class.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.674
Don't be a sissy.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.092
I'm not allowed.

14:02.176 --> 14:04.136
Do you ask permission to pee?

14:04.178 --> 14:05.637
C'mon, show us you can do it.

14:05.721 --> 14:09.308
Prove you're a yamakasi.

14:09.641 --> 14:14.605
Everybody's watching.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.941
You should be ashamed...Come on!

14:17.983 --> 14:24.615
Come on, Djamel!

14:25.282 --> 14:28.660
Prove you're a yamakasi.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.831
You're almost there.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.629
Almost!

14:44.009 --> 14:47.179
Come on, Djamel!

14:51.975 --> 14:53.685
Djamel!

14:59.733 --> 15:00.859
Djamel...no!

15:07.115 --> 15:08.283
Hello?

15:12.996 --> 15:13.997
Djamel?

15:14.248 --> 15:17.000
Aila!

15:17.084 --> 15:18.168
It's Djamel...

15:18.961 --> 15:19.753
Hello?

15:27.928 --> 15:33.767
He's doing OK.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.606
This time, it's serious.

15:39.690 --> 15:40.941
We said: no games.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.276
It was at school. We can't lock him up.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.111
Sure.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.738
What happens now?

15:46.989 --> 15:52.035
We have 24 hours to do the transplant...

15:59.001 --> 16:01.170
He's on the list, isn't he?

16:01.253 --> 16:03.797
Sure, but it's not that simple.

16:03.881 --> 16:05.841
He has top priority but we need a donor.

16:05.883 --> 16:10.179
Right place, right time. It changes hourly.

16:10.304 --> 16:12.347
But what can we do? Nothing?

16:15.058 --> 16:17.019
Come with me.

16:25.319 --> 16:28.697
As I thought...Nothing in France.

16:34.411 --> 16:35.871
So?

16:36.121 --> 16:37.789
We have to wait.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.459
Sometimes, an organ turns up last minute.

16:41.376 --> 16:43.253
Don't lose hope.

16:43.754 --> 16:46.840
Outside France?

16:48.091 --> 16:52.804
We use a go-between company.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.189
Let's take a look.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.942
There's one. Swiss, O negative

17:04.983 --> 17:06.693
available in a few hours.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.779
perfect and unoptioned.

17:08.987 --> 17:09.780
Meaning?

17:10.030 --> 17:11.865
It's not been reserved as yet.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.743
It's free or will become so in a few hours.

17:19.790 --> 17:24.962
How do we take out an option?

17:25.045 --> 17:27.089
Officially, we can't.

17:27.172 --> 17:31.301
Unofficially,
as it's an emergency, I can try.

17:31.802 --> 17:34.680
Go on, then, we're for it.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.890
Any idea of the cost?

17:39.017 --> 17:40.936
At least 400,000 francs.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.235
We ain't got money.

17:49.945 --> 17:52.739
Ask your friends and family.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.908
If everyone chips in...

17:57.369 --> 17:59.162
What about Medicare?

18:00.163 --> 18:02.666
They'll pay for the transplant here.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.627
The rest is not strictly legal.

18:09.339 --> 18:12.301
If it helps, I'll take the risk.

18:12.885 --> 18:14.052
Just for you.

18:18.307 --> 18:20.809
There, I've optioned it. It's reserved.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.269
Djamel has a new heart waiting for him.

18:22.769 --> 18:26.899
You have till noon tomorrow.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.110
It's up to you now.

18:49.296 --> 18:52.090
You'll kill us all. Music can't kill.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.301
Turn it down. I work a drill all day.

18:54.718 --> 18:55.469
Turn it down!

18:55.677 --> 18:56.678
Take an aspirin. All gone.

19:03.060 --> 19:04.978
Aren't my pals cool? Sure.

19:05.479 --> 19:06.396
Careful!

19:06.480 --> 19:10.317
I'll get a sponge. Bring a mop, why not?

19:16.823 --> 19:18.450
Are you on a diet?

19:18.909 --> 19:22.746
They're for my asthma. 2 during meals.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.164
You're still eating?

19:33.340 --> 19:35.050
I bought 2 kgs of lemon.

19:35.342 --> 19:39.847
All gone? Anyone seen...?

19:43.100 --> 19:44.518
Hey, I'm practicing

19:44.810 --> 19:47.104
Try bananas. Fridge's full of them.

19:47.271 --> 19:49.356
Try thinking as fast as you run.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.948
Aren't you coming in? Sure.

20:05.956 --> 20:06.874
Problems?

20:07.124 --> 20:09.084
A kid had a bad fall at school.

20:09.293 --> 20:12.129
Little Djamel. You know him?

20:12.337 --> 20:13.338
Aila's brother. He's in intensive.

20:13.797 --> 20:16.008
Chances are 1 000-1 . Know what happened?

20:16.758 --> 20:24.975
He was climbing a tree at school.
Imitating the big boys.

20:26.018 --> 20:28.228
Vincent! Lovely to see you again.

20:28.312 --> 20:32.816
Where's your uniform?

20:32.900 --> 20:33.984
I work at a desk.

20:34.026 --> 20:37.237
So? Can't you look smart at a desk?

20:59.801 --> 21:01.595
For you boys, it's not short rations.

21:03.055 --> 21:05.474
We're not short.

21:05.933 --> 21:07.059
You did it, Weasel? Honestly?

21:07.392 --> 21:09.228
East face in under 1 0 minutes.

21:20.155 --> 21:21.448
As usual, I was the first one up.

21:21.823 --> 21:23.325
Rasta Rocket! You sure are quick.

21:41.134 --> 21:43.220
It's great but I'm full.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.972
How are you going to catch the thieves

21:45.264 --> 21:48.976
if you're not big enough to frighten them?

22:12.082 --> 22:13.458
Fatima! Not that!

22:14.293 --> 22:16.420
They're taking my son away...

22:16.962 --> 22:18.130
Don't do it! Come inside!

22:18.964 --> 22:21.508
It won't change anything.

22:24.803 --> 22:26.221
Spread out below.

22:26.513 --> 22:29.183
Aila!

22:33.145 --> 22:33.979
No!

22:36.398 --> 22:37.983
Fatima!

22:45.282 --> 22:46.450
Ma!

22:49.620 --> 22:52.581
Fatima!

22:53.290 --> 22:56.293
It's my son who needs help.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.837
We'll sit down and find a solution

22:59.046 --> 23:00.881
we'll help your son. Look at me...

23:01.465 --> 23:03.884
There must be a way.

23:06.178 --> 23:07.846
Trust me.

23:07.930 --> 23:09.556
Listen...

23:11.183 --> 23:12.184
We'll find a way for Djamel.

23:12.226 --> 23:15.062
You have my word.

23:18.065 --> 23:19.191
No!

24:14.079 --> 24:15.455
Proud of yourselves?

24:15.873 --> 24:17.499
What a bunch of idiots, huh?

24:17.583 --> 24:19.001
We saved your mother.

24:19.084 --> 24:23.172
What about my brother?

24:23.463 --> 24:25.424
Who'll save him? You and your stunts?

24:26.091 --> 24:27.509
Djamel will die.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.970
And it's your fault!

24:30.179 --> 24:30.637
Calm down!

24:31.096 --> 24:31.638
Let me go!

24:36.101 --> 24:37.895
We never wanted this.

24:38.103 --> 24:39.438
We never hurt anyone. Just the opposite.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.315
Last week, we saved a granny.

24:41.481 --> 24:44.443
And she didn't even say 'thank you'.

24:44.610 --> 24:47.112
We can't take this, we're no criminals.

24:47.279 --> 24:48.572
Hold on.

24:48.614 --> 24:50.574
We're not irresponsible, you know.

24:52.075 --> 24:55.120
We climb at dawn to avoid the kids.

24:55.162 --> 24:56.455
Stop, you're not blind.

24:56.496 --> 24:59.082
Kids don't ask our permission

24:59.166 --> 25:00.876
before copying us.

25:00.959 --> 25:03.253
OK, so what's the solution?

25:03.420 --> 25:06.340
You stop. Stop what?

25:06.965 --> 25:08.884
Your games.

25:09.051 --> 25:11.011
And sniff glue, burn cars instead?

25:11.094 --> 25:14.264
Smart-mouth!

25:14.348 --> 25:15.599
Smart-mouth?

25:18.101 --> 25:19.269
Finished?

25:19.353 --> 25:20.938
You'll regret not being in uniform.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.523
And you'll regret saying that.

25:22.606 --> 25:23.565
Shut up!

25:24.274 --> 25:26.443
Isn't that enough?

25:26.693 --> 25:28.153
Now, you want a fight, too?

25:29.613 --> 25:31.198
So, what do we do?

25:32.533 --> 25:33.659
The only thing we can.

25:34.034 --> 25:38.664
Make good.

26:05.190 --> 26:07.025
Who let you up here?

26:07.067 --> 26:10.487
We came to see Djamel.

26:10.571 --> 26:13.240
That's not possible. It's too late.

26:13.657 --> 26:15.367
Tomorrow.

26:15.409 --> 26:18.453
We must. Impossible, I said.

26:18.537 --> 26:19.454
If my boss catches you... go home now.

26:19.538 --> 26:20.289
Michelin!

26:22.958 --> 26:24.334
5 minutes.

26:37.556 --> 26:38.473
Can we come in?

26:39.057 --> 26:39.933
Sure.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.191
Cool!

26:47.316 --> 26:48.942
You're here to see me. Wicked!

26:49.276 --> 26:53.530
Is it true about the East face?

26:53.614 --> 26:54.698
News travels fast.

26:54.990 --> 26:58.327
The cops must be spitting blood.

26:58.368 --> 27:00.245
No kidding, they're frothing.

27:00.412 --> 27:03.207
The cops are frothing. Awesome.

27:05.334 --> 27:06.585
When I'm older,

27:06.668 --> 27:09.171
can I be a Yamakasi?

27:12.341 --> 27:14.426
It's a lot of hard work.

27:14.635 --> 27:17.054
When you get out, if you want,

27:17.262 --> 27:19.056
we'll teach you.

27:19.598 --> 27:21.433
You have our word.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.526
What the...? I'll call you back.

27:32.945 --> 27:34.404
You have an appointment?

27:34.488 --> 27:36.490
It's about little Djamel.

27:36.990 --> 27:38.158
I see.

27:39.952 --> 27:41.203
I don't know what to say.

27:41.495 --> 27:42.579
The truth. It's a good start.

27:42.621 --> 27:45.749
You're letting him die.

27:46.083 --> 27:47.042
I put myself at risk
by taking out an option.

27:47.251 --> 27:49.253
There's no more I can do.

27:49.419 --> 27:51.421
What's the money problem?

27:51.630 --> 27:52.756
The hospital cannot fund the transfer.

27:53.006 --> 28:01.515
Do you expect me to pay for it?

28:01.723 --> 28:02.683
Who are these people? Middlemen.

28:03.016 --> 28:06.979
H.T.C. Corp.

28:08.272 --> 28:12.568
What if they lend us the cash first?
We'll pay it back.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.028
Impossible. Even if I go for it,

28:15.195 --> 28:18.365
the 7 board members still need to agree.

28:18.448 --> 28:19.992
So, make 7 calls.

28:20.033 --> 28:21.451
I can't do that. When there's a will...

28:25.330 --> 28:28.125
Just try. It's easy.

28:32.129 --> 28:33.297
I can't! Look at the time!

28:33.338 --> 28:35.424
I can't call just for...

28:35.507 --> 28:37.009
Just for a dying kid?

28:37.176 --> 28:38.302
I didn't say that.

28:38.385 --> 28:40.596
Yours? Give me that!

28:41.054 --> 28:42.055
Very healthy looking. Let go...

28:42.472 --> 28:48.770
Enough!
I want you out of my office in 1 0 seconds

28:48.979 --> 28:52.024
and outside in 1 minute.

28:52.107 --> 28:53.233
The money will be here noon tomorrow.

28:53.275 --> 28:55.444
They let a kid die and say it's our fault!

29:03.744 --> 29:08.123
It's warped. They deserve cutting up.

29:10.125 --> 29:11.126
Bad idea.

29:11.210 --> 29:12.669
Got a better one, wise guy?

29:12.753 --> 29:16.965
This is France. People aren't left to die.

29:17.132 --> 29:20.093
Oh, yeah?

29:20.469 --> 29:22.304
Real life's different from law books.

29:22.471 --> 29:26.058
With no money, Djamel gets left to die.

29:26.099 --> 29:27.184
Shit, calm down!

29:27.768 --> 29:31.271
Let's think. How 'bout the banks?

29:31.313 --> 29:33.232
What? Look at us!

29:33.273 --> 29:35.400
We're not even welcome in clubs.

29:35.609 --> 29:37.778
Only way we get in a bank is with guns.

29:38.237 --> 29:40.364
You wanna lend us yours.

29:40.739 --> 29:44.076
Give me a few hours. I'll get the guys

29:44.284 --> 29:46.745
and we'll do it legally, OK?

29:46.787 --> 29:49.456
You do it by the book,
we'll do it with our hearts.

29:49.706 --> 29:53.627
First to save Djamel wins. Deal?

29:53.710 --> 29:55.087
Just don't do anything stupid.

30:13.856 --> 30:17.109
I'll do all I can. I swear.

30:22.614 --> 30:24.700
Where d'you get that? His office.

30:26.660 --> 30:28.579
There's the 7 guys' addresses.

30:34.668 --> 30:36.628
We'll kick their butts!

30:36.670 --> 30:38.213
No violence.

30:38.297 --> 30:41.300
Yeah, but let's give them hell!

30:41.341 --> 30:48.348
Better than that. We'll tell them a story.

30:48.432 --> 30:49.600
Take from the rich, give to the poor...

30:50.142 --> 30:53.562
That cartoon... Robin Hood.

30:53.645 --> 30:55.189
Rachid's kid sister has it on tape.

30:55.272 --> 30:57.774
It's still stealing, huh? Not really.

30:57.816 --> 31:00.360
'Cuz it's to give back to them

31:02.696 --> 31:05.616
Way to go!

31:06.366 --> 31:09.244
I like that. I like it a lot.

31:09.328 --> 31:12.456
That's some idea. Awesome, man!

31:12.706 --> 31:15.292
And we wind up in jail or hospital.

31:15.375 --> 31:16.710
Don't be such a pessimist. All in?

31:17.085 --> 31:18.253
And me?

31:20.130 --> 31:23.675
I wanna help Djamel, too.

31:24.134 --> 31:25.761
You, stand by.

31:25.802 --> 31:28.430
If things go wrong, we call you.

31:28.639 --> 31:30.307
OK? Great.

31:32.559 --> 31:34.353
We meet up at 5.

31:38.232 --> 31:40.400
Hey, lnspector, can't sleep?

32:33.579 --> 32:36.415
You seen the time?

32:36.498 --> 32:37.499
Early, I know.

32:37.583 --> 32:38.625
My Dad'll kill you!

32:38.792 --> 32:40.210
I have to go. It's important.

32:40.210 --> 32:41.753
If I don't ever see you again...

32:41.837 --> 32:42.838
I know I will but...

32:43.255 --> 32:45.299
I'm no good at this love stuff.

32:45.716 --> 32:47.843
You'll be proud of me.

32:48.468 --> 32:50.470
We have to help Djamel

32:53.891 --> 32:55.475
but it'll take time.

33:20.125 --> 33:27.341
I won't be in today, so I can't clock in.

33:34.515 --> 33:36.308
Leave it to me.

33:52.741 --> 33:56.411
3 groups, 2 jobs each, 60G per job.

33:57.287 --> 33:58.455
Only cash?

33:58.497 --> 34:00.415
Jewelry, credit cards...

34:00.499 --> 34:02.292
Nothing big, nothing heavy.

34:03.335 --> 34:06.588
Meet up at 1 0 at the last address.

34:06.922 --> 34:08.882
2 hours per job is plenty. Don't rush it.

34:09.382 --> 34:12.219
Watch, act, disappear.

34:12.886 --> 34:15.264
Keep your phone handy.

34:15.347 --> 34:17.181
No problem! I've got back-up.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.775
5:30!

35:20.412 --> 35:21.747
5th floor.

35:36.220 --> 35:37.346
Forget it... Kitchen.

36:03.622 --> 36:05.958
This is no time for breakfast. Let's go.

36:13.882 --> 36:15.425
Come on. No way.

36:16.260 --> 36:18.887
4 hours to save Djamel!

36:19.221 --> 36:21.306
You go left, I go right.

37:39.051 --> 37:40.302
Call the police!

38:00.280 --> 38:01.073
Thank you.

38:01.949 --> 38:03.825
Is the minister in? It's important.

38:03.909 --> 38:05.285
He's away today.

38:05.369 --> 38:07.329
His Special Advisor?

38:07.371 --> 38:11.708
I spoke to someone
who said he got in early.

38:11.792 --> 38:13.794
Usually. Are you expected?

38:13.877 --> 38:16.713
It's about a little boy...

38:16.797 --> 38:17.923
Are you expected?

38:20.592 --> 38:23.303
It's urgent. We have until noon...

38:23.387 --> 38:25.472
You must have an appointment.

38:25.556 --> 38:26.640
Write him, I'll see he gets it.

38:26.723 --> 38:27.599
This really is urgent...

38:27.683 --> 38:29.351
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

38:30.394 --> 38:32.896
He's strict on protocol.

38:32.980 --> 38:34.064
A boy is dying

38:34.481 --> 38:36.608
and you're quoting protocol?

38:37.317 --> 38:38.569
Take it easy!

38:38.944 --> 38:40.529
Call your boss. Got it now?

38:40.571 --> 38:42.823
What's going on? Sir...

38:42.990 --> 38:45.534
Inspector Asmine, sir.

38:45.742 --> 38:47.369
Sorry to barge in.

38:47.411 --> 38:50.289
A child is dying. Only you can help.

38:51.832 --> 38:54.459
I didn't realize I was so powerful.

38:56.044 --> 39:00.632
Come in my office.

39:04.970 --> 39:05.762
Take a seat.

39:37.586 --> 39:39.588
He sure can paint.

39:40.672 --> 39:42.299
Look at the size of it.

39:43.342 --> 39:46.845
Nothing big. Find something else.

40:59.418 --> 41:02.004
Enough to put you off music for life.

41:03.338 --> 41:05.007
5 minutes and out.

41:24.610 --> 41:25.819
How d'you know? Mission lmpossible

41:25.903 --> 41:27.779
There must be a key...

41:30.199 --> 41:31.617
I know.

42:00.979 --> 42:03.398
Hold on, the man needs some culture.

42:18.956 --> 42:21.667
Check it out, punk!

42:27.130 --> 42:29.967
A most unusual situation.

42:30.175 --> 42:33.428
I apologize for my unorthodox approach.

42:33.512 --> 42:35.430
No, you were quite right.

42:35.931 --> 42:39.810
It's a reminder that we serve the people.

42:39.852 --> 42:41.895
It does you credit.

42:41.979 --> 42:44.940
Thank you. Can you help?

42:45.065 --> 42:47.860
I'll see what the medical corps can do.

42:47.901 --> 42:53.240
The airforce can spare a plane for this.

42:53.532 --> 42:55.158
Thanks. Thanks for Djamel.

42:55.242 --> 42:56.535
My pleasure.

43:25.189 --> 43:26.440
Ain't life sweet?

43:26.690 --> 43:28.442
A mansion of our own.

43:29.109 --> 43:30.611
Hey, take it easy.

43:32.738 --> 43:33.739
You're crazy.

43:34.031 --> 43:35.824
There are alarms everywhere.

43:36.158 --> 43:37.993
No worries, watch this.

43:49.213 --> 43:51.924
Easy. Too easy to be true.

44:01.475 --> 44:02.476
Too heavy.

44:02.893 --> 44:04.770
Too fragile. Too cool!

44:15.197 --> 44:16.114
Oh no!

44:16.240 --> 44:18.075
We're screwed!

44:59.241 --> 45:00.200
They're splitting up.

45:00.826 --> 45:01.785
What do we do?

45:02.578 --> 45:04.037
We wait. Spread out.

45:04.746 --> 45:05.831
A bit more.

45:05.914 --> 45:06.874
Now!

45:34.234 --> 45:35.611
No more dogs for me.

45:35.819 --> 45:37.279
I warned you.

45:37.905 --> 45:40.199
Man's best friend...yeah, right.

45:40.824 --> 45:43.952
Hope the others are doing better.

45:44.703 --> 45:45.913
We'll make up for it.

45:46.538 --> 45:48.248
I ain't going back there.

45:53.295 --> 45:54.755
Aila? It's Vincent.

45:55.756 --> 45:57.716
I've got good news.

45:58.008 --> 45:59.676
I saw the Minister's top man.

46:00.010 --> 46:02.095
He wants to help us...

46:02.513 --> 46:04.515
Djamel, I mean.

46:04.681 --> 46:09.144
He's doing all he can

46:09.269 --> 46:11.063
and he'll call me. Great, huh?

46:11.104 --> 46:13.065
What's he suggesting exactly?

46:13.273 --> 46:18.111
Commandeering a military aircraft...

46:18.654 --> 46:20.197
Aila?

46:20.280 --> 46:21.281
Hold on.

46:21.615 --> 46:24.326
They'll do all that for Djamel?

46:24.576 --> 46:26.620
Sure, he promised me.

46:26.912 --> 46:29.915
Do you doubt me?

46:30.082 --> 46:33.126
Not you, all the rest of it.

46:35.128 --> 46:38.674
Be strong. Djamel will be saved.

46:39.508 --> 46:41.510
We're getting there, trust me.

46:41.593 --> 46:44.304
What's going on? Gotta go.

46:44.555 --> 46:47.057
You're a cop, not a social worker!

46:47.099 --> 46:49.059
Your job is to protect, not hassle people.

46:49.101 --> 46:50.894
But... No buts!

46:51.019 --> 46:53.730
The Minister's Advisor called me.

46:53.814 --> 46:57.609
Why did you insult him in his office?

46:57.693 --> 46:58.902
I didn't! He says so.

46:58.986 --> 47:01.238
You beat up his guy, barged in the door,

47:01.321 --> 47:04.741
and told him some sob story.

47:04.783 --> 47:06.743
That's not true!

47:06.785 --> 47:08.579
Who cares if it's true or not?

47:08.579 --> 47:12.291
The problem is dealing with all this crap.

47:12.332 --> 47:14.751
Honestly, I don't get it.

47:14.835 --> 47:16.170
Stop being so naive, it's boring.

47:16.253 --> 47:17.629
A boy could die...

47:19.298 --> 47:21.967
We're cops, OK? Not God or charity.

47:22.050 --> 47:23.927
Our job is to obey orders.

47:24.011 --> 47:25.679
A dying kid is not our problem.

47:25.721 --> 47:27.681
Obey! Get that into your head.

47:27.931 --> 47:30.058
We don't think, we keep order.

47:30.058 --> 47:31.226
Do your job and the flock's OK.

47:31.310 --> 47:34.104
It's not complicated.

47:34.313 --> 47:41.570
Here, make yourself useful.

47:57.920 --> 48:00.088
What are you doing?

48:00.756 --> 48:02.883
Don't worry, it's routine.

48:03.091 --> 48:05.052
He can't stay where he was.

48:05.135 --> 48:07.221
Why not? We need the space.

48:07.304 --> 48:09.264
He's OK here. In the hallway?

48:09.973 --> 48:13.352
For now. We'll keep an eye on him.

48:13.936 --> 48:16.230
He's not dead yet, you know!

48:16.605 --> 48:19.816
The morgue's downstairs.
Here, we treat people.

48:20.025 --> 48:21.902
There's 5 of us for the whole floor.

48:22.653 --> 48:25.906
And 2 serious cases have just arrived.

48:25.989 --> 48:27.908
My brother's not serious?

48:27.991 --> 48:30.577
For the moment, we can't help him.

48:30.619 --> 48:32.704
The others have priority.

48:32.788 --> 48:34.373
But his turn will come.

48:34.581 --> 48:35.791
The best thing you can do

48:35.874 --> 48:40.879
is to calm down and stay with him.

48:49.847 --> 48:51.181
Easy, boys, easy.

48:53.183 --> 48:55.185
Police. Come in.

49:00.232 --> 49:01.859
The burglary?

49:02.067 --> 49:05.571
Didn't take much. My dogs chased them off.

49:06.321 --> 49:09.741
They got in by neutralizing the door alarm.

49:09.908 --> 49:14.955
then into the living room.

49:15.038 --> 49:16.206
Why they?

49:20.335 --> 49:21.920
That!

49:22.337 --> 49:23.755
8 cameras. I got them from every angle.

49:23.839 --> 49:27.134
Look.

49:29.052 --> 49:30.387
You're well-equipped.

49:30.721 --> 49:32.806
After 5 burglaries, I'd had enough.

49:33.223 --> 49:34.683
What do you do? I'm a surgeon.

49:34.933 --> 49:36.894
I'm never home.

49:39.897 --> 49:41.064
Very agile.

49:41.148 --> 49:42.858
Real spring lambs. A circus act?

49:42.900 --> 49:45.903
D'you mind?

49:53.744 --> 49:56.371
Check if there's been similar jobs today.

49:57.039 --> 49:59.374
Coffee? Thanks.

49:59.791 --> 50:00.709
Yeah, me too.

50:02.085 --> 50:04.421
May l? The wall socket there.

50:23.774 --> 50:28.320
Look! A rash of acrobatic burglaries.

50:28.654 --> 50:29.905
4 this morning. And counting.

50:30.739 --> 50:32.741
See what links the victims.

50:32.824 --> 50:36.328
Sports club, car or something...

50:37.829 --> 50:39.331
Easy. They're all doctors.

50:39.706 --> 50:41.667
I knew it.

50:42.084 --> 50:43.293
Any progress?

50:44.962 --> 50:46.088
Some.

50:47.130 --> 50:50.050
You know Henry Piracy? He's a colleague.

50:50.759 --> 50:54.805
Mr. Gautier? Mr. Bernier?

50:54.888 --> 50:57.724
Fellow board members.

50:57.891 --> 51:00.978
7 in all. Directors of the same company.

51:04.773 --> 51:05.399
The 7th advises the Minister.

51:05.440 --> 51:06.692
A printer? 3.

51:08.777 --> 51:11.238
Warn the others to expect visitors.

51:11.697 --> 51:12.447
I'll handle the Advisor.

51:14.700 --> 51:15.784
Goodbye.

51:16.869 --> 51:19.663
The Ministry guy's not our jurisdiction.

51:19.746 --> 51:21.331
I can handle it.

51:21.415 --> 51:26.670
You sure? After this morning...

51:26.753 --> 51:28.338
Don't think, just obey orders.

51:28.380 --> 51:30.382
So, obey!

51:45.731 --> 51:47.399
Who is it? Police!

51:50.152 --> 51:51.904
Sorry to disturb you.

51:52.154 --> 51:56.283
A gang of burglars has you on their list.

51:56.408 --> 51:58.243
That's awful! Don't panic.

51:58.285 --> 52:01.705
You're safe now. Can we look around?

52:01.872 --> 52:04.917
Of course, come in.

52:09.379 --> 52:11.757
Very nice. It's a Klimt.

52:15.260 --> 52:18.972
We need to search.
Do you mind? Go right ahead.

52:34.404 --> 52:35.906
Nothing there.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.699
You think they're here?

52:37.783 --> 52:40.118
You can never be too sure.

52:51.880 --> 52:54.216
The way we work is simple.

52:58.136 --> 52:59.137
Leave no stone unturned.

53:08.146 --> 53:09.731
Apparently, no one's here.

53:10.816 --> 53:12.192
Apparently, it's all OK.

53:12.776 --> 53:15.112
I said... Apparently.

53:17.364 --> 53:18.991
They're slippery fellows.

53:20.367 --> 53:22.995
And they work fast, in and out.

53:25.914 --> 53:29.209
Are they dangerous? You never know...

54:36.485 --> 54:38.237
Well? Find anything?

54:38.403 --> 54:41.990
You can sleep soundly tonight.

54:42.241 --> 54:44.076
What if they come anyway?

54:44.159 --> 54:48.080
Don't worry, we're everywhere.

54:49.540 --> 54:51.291
A mouse couldn't get through.

54:53.085 --> 54:55.462
Thank you, I feel much safer.

54:55.546 --> 54:58.382
We're just doing our duty, Ma'am.

55:02.427 --> 55:06.014
1 0 more minutes, I'd have here howling.

55:08.475 --> 55:11.186
Jesus, my Klimt! They stole my Klimt!

55:11.270 --> 55:13.230
What Klimt? I don't get it.

55:13.313 --> 55:15.482
Behind you, you idiots!

55:15.858 --> 55:18.068
See anything?

55:18.151 --> 55:19.403
Nothing.

55:20.153 --> 55:22.364
They were here!

55:23.365 --> 55:25.325
My Klimt! Calm down!

55:25.367 --> 55:27.786
What the...?

55:31.248 --> 55:32.416
They're on the roof. Call for back-up.

55:33.542 --> 55:36.587
Let's move it!

55:49.850 --> 55:50.893
You, over there, move it!

55:53.020 --> 55:54.229
Oh crap!

55:58.817 --> 55:59.985
We're in deep.

56:01.612 --> 56:02.821
Cut it out!

56:26.345 --> 56:27.346
There!

56:31.308 --> 56:32.935
Stop!

56:35.395 --> 56:37.564
There they are! This way!

57:23.569 --> 57:24.987
Stubborn, these guys.

57:38.083 --> 57:40.169
There they are!

57:57.144 --> 57:59.021
Freeze! Police!

58:00.898 --> 58:02.608
Don't move. Nice and easy.

58:02.983 --> 58:04.526
Come this way.

58:04.610 --> 58:05.903
Over here!

58:05.986 --> 58:09.364
Easy does it. Come on.

58:10.073 --> 58:12.284
Guess we don't have a plan C?

58:12.409 --> 58:15.579
Hands on heads!

58:16.205 --> 58:17.331
Gave us the runaround, didn't you?

58:17.414 --> 58:18.582
Hands on head

58:19.583 --> 58:21.210
Sure we do.

58:28.008 --> 58:29.259
Come here!

58:34.097 --> 58:37.059
No funny stuff!

58:37.684 --> 58:38.560
Don't be stupid!

58:48.237 --> 58:49.112
Don't be...

58:49.196 --> 58:50.155
Crazy...!

58:53.659 --> 58:54.618
No way.

58:57.037 --> 58:58.330
What's all the...?

59:04.002 --> 59:05.128
Ludo?

59:06.129 --> 59:07.089
I know...

59:07.172 --> 59:10.259
After homework, I'll tidy the room.

59:10.926 --> 59:15.264
We take the stairs? Sure, take the stairs.

59:19.142 --> 59:21.937
Crazy...

59:25.148 --> 59:29.444
Thanks for coming.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.269
They're here. Near. I saw them.

01:00:02.644 --> 01:00:05.480
Who, Djamel? Who's here?

01:00:05.689 --> 01:00:09.318
The spirits...watching over me.

01:00:48.649 --> 01:00:52.110
No injuries? Not yet. Touch wood.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:04.081
Getting anywhere?

01:01:04.206 --> 01:01:05.207
Slowly.

01:01:05.457 --> 01:01:08.502
Get busy, then, instead of hassling us.

01:01:08.585 --> 01:01:10.420
Haven't you done enough?

01:01:10.504 --> 01:01:13.298
What have you done? Seen the Minister?

01:01:13.507 --> 01:01:16.760
And? He's on the case.

01:01:18.971 --> 01:01:20.055
Let's go.

01:01:20.222 --> 01:01:21.515
I can't let you do this.

01:01:21.598 --> 01:01:23.183
I'm a cop, remember.

01:01:23.267 --> 01:01:25.519
Change jobs. No can do.

01:01:25.686 --> 01:01:27.396
I fight for what I believe in.

01:01:27.479 --> 01:01:29.147
And we're fighting to save Djamel, see?

01:01:29.523 --> 01:01:30.566
Let us by, we're late.

01:01:30.649 --> 01:01:32.359
This is suicidal.

01:01:32.609 --> 01:01:37.990
The cops'll come and blow you away.

01:01:38.073 --> 01:01:41.326
He really thinks he's Dirty Harry!

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:42.619
Shut it, Rocket!

01:01:42.703 --> 01:01:44.121
Have some respect!

01:01:46.248 --> 01:01:48.041
You guys don't get it, huh?

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:52.004
There's friendship, and the law.

01:01:52.087 --> 01:01:54.673
If I betray my beliefs, I'm nothing.

01:01:56.091 --> 01:01:57.593
It's all we have. Without it,

01:01:58.051 --> 01:02:00.512
we've no self-respect, see?

01:02:00.596 --> 01:02:05.142
We don't see why a kid's life

01:02:05.225 --> 01:02:06.101
depends on rich doctors.

01:02:06.185 --> 01:02:07.144
That's our belief. We'll see it through.

01:02:07.394 --> 01:02:09.980
Or we'd always regret it.

01:02:10.063 --> 01:02:12.774
There must be another solution. Forget it.

01:02:12.983 --> 01:02:14.484
There's no time.

01:02:15.027 --> 01:02:16.612
Next time we see Aila and Fatima,

01:02:16.653 --> 01:02:20.199
what would we do? Hide our eyes?

01:02:51.104 --> 01:02:53.607
Coming!

01:02:55.526 --> 01:02:57.653
Who are you? Robbers!

01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:11.124
Check this place out!

01:03:11.416 --> 01:03:13.377
My building'd fit in here.

01:03:13.544 --> 01:03:15.712
We'll be here all day.

01:03:15.796 --> 01:03:17.172
OK, split up. A floor each.

01:03:17.214 --> 01:03:19.132
5 minutes, and we're gone.

01:03:22.219 --> 01:03:25.138
A burglary? I'll be right there.

01:03:33.105 --> 01:03:34.439
I made the call.

01:03:34.731 --> 01:03:37.234
They still inside? Most likely.

01:03:37.442 --> 01:03:39.152
How many? What type? Black?

01:03:39.236 --> 01:03:40.571
Arab?

01:03:40.654 --> 01:03:42.489
Those the only types?

01:03:43.031 --> 01:03:44.783
Answer the questions.
Several. No one type.

01:03:45.409 --> 01:03:47.369
Very observant of you. Great help.

01:03:47.411 --> 01:03:50.205
Come on, guys, let's go.

01:03:50.539 --> 01:03:54.459
3 teams. Constant contact.

01:04:28.243 --> 01:04:29.161
Watch out!

01:04:29.828 --> 01:04:31.622
Take cover!

01:04:47.596 --> 01:04:49.473
In the closet.

01:05:04.196 --> 01:05:04.780
Cops all over!

01:05:05.072 --> 01:05:05.822
The war's not over.

01:05:06.073 --> 01:05:07.157
They're everywhere. I preferred the dogs.

01:05:07.241 --> 01:05:08.825
Do we have a plan B?

01:05:11.787 --> 01:05:15.374
Not yet. Keep going.

01:05:22.881 --> 01:05:25.300
They're armed to the teeth.

01:05:25.384 --> 01:05:27.177
You sure it was them?

01:05:27.219 --> 01:05:30.514
Who then, the maid? Now go home.

01:05:30.597 --> 01:05:32.641
and let us do our job.

01:05:37.896 --> 01:05:40.566
What are you doing here?

01:05:40.649 --> 01:05:41.650
My job. I raised the alarm.

01:05:41.733 --> 01:05:44.695
Is that OK with you?

01:05:44.778 --> 01:05:46.822
I asked you to leave.

01:05:47.114 --> 01:05:48.740
Roadblock turned me back.

01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:52.494
Orsini. Officer in charge here.

01:05:52.619 --> 01:05:54.705
Asmine saw them entering your house,

01:05:54.788 --> 01:05:58.458
called us and here we are.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:05:59.501
They're still inside?

01:05:59.835 --> 01:06:00.627
Yes.

01:06:00.711 --> 01:06:02.129
What are you waiting for?

01:06:02.212 --> 01:06:03.714
For them to wreck my house?

01:06:04.131 --> 01:06:06.758
We have to plan our operation.

01:06:07.259 --> 01:06:10.095
Is anybody else inside?

01:06:10.179 --> 01:06:12.556
Nobody! I have valuable objects.

01:06:12.639 --> 01:06:15.184
Get in there before they're ruined.

01:06:15.267 --> 01:06:17.269
That may make a mess, too.

01:06:18.145 --> 01:06:20.647
You have 5 minutes to kick them out

01:06:20.731 --> 01:06:22.900
or I call your superiors.

01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:25.819
As you wish, sir.

01:06:33.202 --> 01:06:35.495
Smoke bombs! Can't see a thing.

01:06:36.538 --> 01:06:37.873
Upstairs!

01:06:44.922 --> 01:06:47.591
Well, Captain?

01:06:47.799 --> 01:06:48.842
They're obviously lunatics. Attack.

01:06:49.676 --> 01:06:50.928
Charge!

01:06:59.895 --> 01:07:03.899
This is bad. Think of something!

01:07:04.149 --> 01:07:05.526
I've got it.

01:07:09.696 --> 01:07:13.200
We need you. Now.

01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:14.326
On my way.

01:07:17.579 --> 01:07:19.373
Move it!

01:07:42.396 --> 01:07:45.524
Door open.

01:07:45.607 --> 01:07:47.776
Encountering resistance, over.

01:07:48.235 --> 01:07:50.404
Proceed floor by floor.

01:07:50.445 --> 01:07:52.781
Calm and methodical, OK?

01:07:58.662 --> 01:08:02.457
What are they doing? Cleaning up.

01:08:08.255 --> 01:08:09.840
Come on, let's go.

01:08:13.218 --> 01:08:15.721
2 civilians coming out.

01:08:15.971 --> 01:08:17.764
Not wounded. Ambulance?

01:08:17.805 --> 01:08:20.350
You said no one was inside?

01:08:20.434 --> 01:08:21.768
There wasn't. Except the maid...

01:08:21.852 --> 01:08:26.398
I don't know when she's in!

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:30.777
Extreme caution.
I don't want a hostage situation.

01:08:31.569 --> 01:08:33.654
Pull all the strings you want.

01:08:33.738 --> 01:08:37.868
Your irresponsibility
will be noted in my report.

01:08:40.495 --> 01:08:41.955
Come with me.

01:08:44.917 --> 01:08:47.502
There must be a hatch to the roof.

01:08:55.301 --> 01:08:56.636
Coast clear.

01:09:06.647 --> 01:09:07.939
We got a problem.

01:09:08.564 --> 01:09:09.899
2, in fact.

01:09:13.237 --> 01:09:14.279
Who are you?

01:09:14.363 --> 01:09:15.697
Carlos. Jean-Pierre.

01:09:15.822 --> 01:09:16.698
You live here?

01:09:16.865 --> 01:09:19.618
My Mom's the maid. I come and play.

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:21.578
We're buddies.

01:09:21.787 --> 01:09:22.871
What Level?

01:09:24.831 --> 01:09:26.207
Level 3.

01:09:30.962 --> 01:09:33.256
Another barricade. Cut through.

01:09:41.515 --> 01:09:43.684
We have 2 kids here.

01:09:43.725 --> 01:09:45.644
Clear out and we'll hand them over.

01:09:47.563 --> 01:09:51.774
The 2 kids...are they staff,
Yours or another omission?

01:09:51.942 --> 01:09:53.986
2 kids? I don't have any kids.

01:09:54.236 --> 01:09:56.405
I mean, my son's away with my wife.

01:09:56.488 --> 01:09:57.990
I've no idea...

01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:58.991
Is the maid live-in?

01:09:59.241 --> 01:10:01.660
No, she only does afternoons.

01:10:02.369 --> 01:10:04.830
They must be hers. Ask her.

01:10:05.539 --> 01:10:07.249
Leave the sector.

01:10:07.332 --> 01:10:09.668
It's getting dangerous here.

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:12.254
I'm big enough to know what...

01:10:12.296 --> 01:10:14.464
Leave or you will be arrested!

01:10:14.506 --> 01:10:15.716
Is that clear?

01:10:22.055 --> 01:10:24.725
Through there, kids. Go home.

01:10:29.813 --> 01:10:32.482
Less games and more sports, OK?

01:10:34.651 --> 01:10:36.653
They've got my arm!

01:10:36.862 --> 01:10:38.030
Help me!

01:10:38.655 --> 01:10:39.823
Let him go!

01:10:46.496 --> 01:10:48.290
We have to get on the roof, guys.

01:10:48.332 --> 01:10:49.583
Quickly...

01:11:00.385 --> 01:11:03.430
I told you to let them out before going in.

01:11:03.764 --> 01:11:05.349
That's what we did.

01:11:06.266 --> 01:11:07.643
What's wrong with everyone?
ls it a full moon?

01:11:07.851 --> 01:11:09.394
Darn it!

01:11:14.274 --> 01:11:16.026
Up here. Good work.

01:11:36.672 --> 01:11:39.883
Where the hell are you? 1 00 yards away.

01:11:40.342 --> 01:11:42.845
There's a roadblock. I'll give it a try.

01:11:44.096 --> 01:11:46.598
Hi, officer, I live over there.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:47.432
I just wanna go home. No way. Turn left.

01:11:47.516 --> 01:11:51.395
And hang up!

01:11:52.855 --> 01:11:54.690
Worse than our cops.

01:11:54.815 --> 01:11:56.316
Park it up and walk.

01:11:56.525 --> 01:11:58.902
Get around northside. OK, I'll call you.

01:12:00.821 --> 01:12:03.657
Put all the loot in one bag.

01:12:22.384 --> 01:12:23.969
Near the wall, please.

01:12:24.344 --> 01:12:26.763
What's going on? You can't stay here.

01:12:26.847 --> 01:12:28.891
I live just there. Sorry, too dangerous.

01:12:28.974 --> 01:12:31.351
Come back later. It can't wait.

01:12:31.435 --> 01:12:34.563
I need my pills or I die.

01:12:34.646 --> 01:12:37.024
It's a fine place to die

01:12:37.065 --> 01:12:39.568
but I'd ruin your career.

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:53.707
I saw movement up there. 3rd floor.

01:12:56.001 --> 01:12:58.587
South side. 3rd floor.

01:12:58.670 --> 01:12:59.546
Got it.

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:13.060
I'm through. Gimme 1 0 secs.

01:13:13.727 --> 01:13:15.854
I see you. Get running.

01:13:16.063 --> 01:13:17.397
You know what you gotta do?

01:13:17.397 --> 01:13:18.398
No problem.

01:13:19.066 --> 01:13:20.400
Baseball, it's all yours!

01:13:26.657 --> 01:13:27.699
Against the wall!

01:13:48.428 --> 01:13:49.555
On the roof.

01:13:54.476 --> 01:13:56.645
Yankees 0, Visitors 1 .

01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:03.110
I'm gonna tell a story; so listen up.

01:14:07.072 --> 01:14:11.827
Hands up!

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:14.371
All under control!

01:14:14.454 --> 01:14:16.540
And about time, too.

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.458
Thanks. Help me with my report.

01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:21.879
I'll need support against the Advisor.

01:14:21.962 --> 01:14:23.088
C'mon, move it out!

01:14:24.673 --> 01:14:27.926
Coming? I have my car.

01:14:28.927 --> 01:14:29.928
Go!

01:14:45.402 --> 01:14:46.361
I have good news.

01:14:46.862 --> 01:14:49.573
The donor died 1 0 minutes ago.

01:14:51.158 --> 01:14:53.744
They need an answer within the hour

01:14:53.785 --> 01:14:55.954
so the organ can be transplanted.

01:14:57.956 --> 01:15:00.792
How's it going...The money?

01:15:02.419 --> 01:15:05.839
It's coming.
It'll be here at noon as agreed.

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:09.801
We'll see.

01:15:20.479 --> 01:15:22.439
What now?

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:26.026
You always have a plan? What do we do?

01:15:26.902 --> 01:15:28.403
It was jail or hospital.

01:15:28.487 --> 01:15:30.113
I choose hospital.

01:15:30.614 --> 01:15:32.991
They'd only patch you up for jail...

01:15:33.033 --> 01:15:34.993
I hope it's worth it and Djamel recovers.

01:15:35.077 --> 01:15:36.537
Dream on.

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:38.455
What? Who did we give the cash to?

01:15:38.497 --> 01:15:43.001
That doofus is gonna get skinned.

01:15:54.638 --> 01:15:55.764
How much?

01:15:57.766 --> 01:15:59.434
227,500 francs?

01:15:59.643 --> 01:16:01.812
For the lot? Not a penny less.

01:16:11.029 --> 01:16:14.408
It's a lot but it's for a good cause.

01:16:24.418 --> 01:16:26.628
In that case, you got a deal.

01:16:27.504 --> 01:16:28.547
Deal!

01:16:30.424 --> 01:16:32.843
On your feet. Boss wants to see you.

01:16:40.058 --> 01:16:41.518
OK, son, I'm listening.

01:16:41.852 --> 01:16:45.189
Wednesday's my day off. So I go to Paris...

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:48.901
Change of air. Seemed a good idea...

01:16:49.109 --> 01:16:53.113
We cruised by the posh neighborhoods...

01:16:53.197 --> 01:16:54.239
Like a museum...

01:16:54.489 --> 01:16:55.532
And free...

01:16:55.616 --> 01:16:58.035
And we're checking out this mansion...

01:16:58.118 --> 01:17:00.078
Huge pad...Cinderella's palace...

01:17:00.162 --> 01:17:02.164
Suddenly...Shouts...

01:17:02.164 --> 01:17:04.458
Screams...Cinderella's...

01:17:04.499 --> 01:17:07.503
What do we do? We go in...

01:17:07.586 --> 01:17:09.463
Call the cops? Not our style.

01:17:09.505 --> 01:17:12.966
Sorry

01:17:13.133 --> 01:17:14.426
Where we come from, can't trust no cops.

01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:17.012
We jump over the gate...
Save the damsel in distress...

01:17:17.095 --> 01:17:20.098
The window was open...And 2 scumbags...

01:17:20.182 --> 01:17:22.476
Actually, 3 punks...No, at least 5...

01:17:22.559 --> 01:17:25.145
Skinheads and swastikas...6 of them...

01:17:25.229 --> 01:17:26.939
Beating the lady...

01:17:27.022 --> 01:17:28.857
Throwing her in the closet...
We jumped 'em...

01:17:28.899 --> 01:17:31.985
Whaled 'em...Worked 'em over...

01:17:32.069 --> 01:17:34.738
You'd have done the same.

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:37.783
Then, sirens...Cops all over...

01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:40.619
Meanwhile, the 2 lowlifes beat it...

01:17:40.702 --> 01:17:42.204
Looks bad for us...

01:17:42.454 --> 01:17:43.872
Cops shoot first...Ask questions later...

01:17:43.956 --> 01:17:45.499
We panic... Natural...

01:17:47.459 --> 01:17:50.003
Bullshit... Honest truth, Captain

01:17:50.045 --> 01:17:51.588
On my mother's life...

01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:53.715
And my brothers', and my friends...

01:17:53.882 --> 01:17:55.759
And my dad's, except he's dead already...

01:17:55.843 --> 01:17:57.052
My whole family...

01:17:57.094 --> 01:17:58.887
I'd spit but you'd object.

01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:01.056
Lock 'em up!

01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:05.519
Have you ever read such crap?

01:18:06.937 --> 01:18:09.106
Everything written here is true.

01:18:09.898 --> 01:18:11.900
I'll testify to that.

01:18:15.153 --> 01:18:16.864
That simplifies everything.

01:18:17.739 --> 01:18:19.575
I hope you're covered.

01:18:21.994 --> 01:18:23.495
Better be.

01:18:27.165 --> 01:18:28.166
Hey, the 7 Dwarves, let's go!

01:18:28.667 --> 01:18:31.628
Let's go, I said. You're free.

01:18:31.879 --> 01:18:35.465
The lnspector backs up your story.

01:18:35.716 --> 01:18:37.968
Move it before he reconsiders.

01:18:51.815 --> 01:18:55.819
I've got the money!

01:19:11.502 --> 01:19:14.463
Count it! I believe you...

01:19:14.546 --> 01:19:18.091
400,000 francs in cash by noon.

01:19:18.175 --> 01:19:19.510
Call them. There's no time to waste.

01:19:19.635 --> 01:19:22.179
Of course... but it's 1 2:1 0.

01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:24.890
So we're 1 0 minutes late. Sorry.

01:19:25.098 --> 01:19:27.184
Now, call your friends.

01:19:27.267 --> 01:19:29.937
Hurry. Someone bid 500,000.

01:19:33.815 --> 01:19:36.151
I tried to hold them, but in the end...

01:19:40.948 --> 01:19:42.241
I'm terribly sorry.

01:19:43.659 --> 01:19:45.035
Are you sure you tried?

01:19:53.085 --> 01:19:57.548
Because you're trying our patience.

01:20:02.177 --> 01:20:04.930
Back off! Don't try anything.

01:20:05.138 --> 01:20:06.807
Get out, or I call the cops.

01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:09.059
We're already here.

01:20:11.103 --> 01:20:14.106
I'll move slowly toward you.

01:20:18.986 --> 01:20:21.697
Close enough? Can you read it?

01:20:22.114 --> 01:20:23.991
It says Police.

01:20:24.157 --> 01:20:25.701
Put down your gun.

01:20:25.784 --> 01:20:28.579
Pointing a gun at a civilian
can get you 1 2 months.

01:20:42.259 --> 01:20:46.138
Let's forget that for now.

01:20:48.056 --> 01:20:49.933
We'll talk man to man.

01:20:50.976 --> 01:20:52.978
How much is your life worth? 20,000?

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:56.899
Let's be generous. 1 00,000 francs?

01:20:58.734 --> 01:21:01.320
Plus 400,000 equals 500,000.

01:21:01.904 --> 01:21:04.198
Exactly what we need.

01:21:04.781 --> 01:21:06.909
In 2 hours, Djamel has a new heart

01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:13.373
Or I mangle yours. Got it?

01:21:44.613 --> 01:21:47.115
Turn it down, will you?

01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:54.206
I am proud of you.
Sure but watch my jacket.

01:21:54.665 --> 01:21:56.250
Mr. Hotshot!

01:22:05.342 --> 01:22:07.219
Good news. You got fired?

01:22:07.302 --> 01:22:08.804
Even better, I resigned.

01:22:21.608 --> 01:22:24.403
Guys, the tape's for Djamel.

01:22:24.611 --> 01:22:25.404
If you have a message...

01:22:25.612 --> 01:22:26.864
Can you see us?

01:22:27.114 --> 01:22:28.115
Hope you're feeling OK.

01:22:28.365 --> 01:22:29.825
Get well soon.
