08:49.921 --> 08:51.420
Maybe if you
told me in code,

08:51.422 --> 08:53.322
like you're an apple
and he's an orange.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.657
Okay, well,
you know how an orange

08:54.659 --> 08:55.992
has that hard, nubby part?

08:55.994 --> 08:57.793
[gags]
No more.

08:57.795 --> 08:59.328
Fair enough.
Just don't tell anybody

08:59.330 --> 09:01.063
we had a one-night
stand, okay?

09:01.065 --> 09:02.798
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.200
Okay.

09:04.202 --> 09:07.136
- You slept with Rodrigo?
- Starting now.

09:07.138 --> 09:08.204
I only texted Gael!

09:08.206 --> 09:09.672
Well, how did you do that?

09:09.674 --> 09:11.574
We've maintained eye contact
this whole time.

09:11.576 --> 09:12.975
I have a talent.

09:12.977 --> 09:15.011
I'm ordering shoes right now.

09:16.981 --> 09:18.981
I'm gonna need
all the details.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.785
Okay, I didn't need
all the details.

09:24.656 --> 09:26.155
Oh, no.

09:26.157 --> 09:27.757
Hello, Gael.

09:27.759 --> 09:30.826
It's me, Isabela,
not my identical twin.

09:30.828 --> 09:32.662
Oh, thank you for
letting me know,

09:32.664 --> 09:36.265
as your twin looks in no way,
shape, or form younger than you.

09:36.267 --> 09:42.138
Carmen, this is Gael,
my sweet little co-star.

09:42.140 --> 09:43.372
[all laugh]

09:43.374 --> 09:45.741
So why have we not
met Carmen before?

09:45.743 --> 09:48.878
Well, growing up, we were the
Olsen twins of the novela world.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.447
And then we were both up
for the same part in a movie.

09:51.449 --> 09:53.215
Isabela got it, of course,

09:53.217 --> 09:55.251
and I was a bit
of a sore loser.

09:55.253 --> 09:57.553
Oh, you would've brought
so much more to the role.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.322
And I don't mean that
as a fat joke.

09:59.324 --> 10:01.657
She was a half pound more
than me when we were born.

10:01.659 --> 10:05.094
Oh, stop! I'm just so glad
we're finally moving past this.

10:05.096 --> 10:07.997
I thought I lost
my sister forever.

10:07.999 --> 10:10.232
You don't know how much
this means to me.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.301
[cries]

10:12.303 --> 10:15.504
[sobbing]

10:15.506 --> 10:17.139
Look at me,
crying like my housekeeper

10:17.141 --> 10:19.342
when I yelled at her for
using the good bathroom.

10:19.344 --> 10:21.143
I have to get
cleaned up.

10:21.145 --> 10:23.879
I'm shooting a scene
where I wake from a coma,

10:23.881 --> 10:25.848
but when I bolt up,
I hit my head

10:25.850 --> 10:27.216
and I fall back into a coma.

10:27.218 --> 10:28.284
Oh!

10:30.488 --> 10:33.990
Oh, Gael, I've missed
so many years with my sister.

10:33.992 --> 10:37.827
Fill me in-- what's it like
working with Isabela?

10:37.829 --> 10:42.131
- It's, uh--
- Oh, I know that look.

10:42.133 --> 10:46.135
Isabela is the best, but
sometimes she can be... prickly.

10:46.137 --> 10:47.303
[laughs nervously]

10:47.305 --> 10:48.938
You know, when we were six,

10:48.940 --> 10:51.007
she kidnapped my teddy bear
and held it for ransom.

10:51.009 --> 10:54.210
Oh, my God, she did the same
thing to my asthma inhaler.

10:54.212 --> 10:57.246
[laughs]
She's crazy!

10:58.383 --> 11:00.016
- Hey, Rodrigo.
- Yo.

11:00.018 --> 11:02.151
- Do you use a stunt double?
- [scoffs] No.

11:02.153 --> 11:03.419
I do my own stunts.

11:03.421 --> 11:04.987
People call me
the Latino Jackie Chan.

11:04.989 --> 11:06.288
Really?

11:06.290 --> 11:07.957
If I say it enough,
it'll catch on.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.425
Yeah, I'm thinking about
doing my own stunts too.

11:09.427 --> 11:11.527
Oh, he's just embarrassed

11:11.529 --> 11:13.095
because his stunt man
is a woman,

11:13.097 --> 11:15.264
but that's nothing
to be ashamed of.

11:15.266 --> 11:17.600
Tell him, Rodrigo.

11:17.602 --> 11:20.703
[laughs]

11:20.705 --> 11:23.172
A woman?

11:23.174 --> 11:25.107
A woman!

11:25.109 --> 11:26.142
It's not funny.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.643
What's wrong?

11:27.645 --> 11:29.378
They keep teasing me
about my stunt person.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.514
Oh, well, you need a good one,
you can use mine.

11:31.516 --> 11:35.017
- Her name's Colleen.
- [laughs]

11:35.019 --> 11:37.586
You do have
the same stunt person!

11:37.588 --> 11:40.256
[laughing]

11:40.258 --> 11:41.857
That was funny.

11:45.630 --> 11:47.296
- Good coffee.
- Yeah.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.503
- I made love to Mimi.
- Yes! [laughs]

11:54.505 --> 11:56.639
Now that you know that I know,
we can both talk about it.

11:56.641 --> 11:59.141
- She was so wild.
- [gags]

11:59.143 --> 12:01.977
I'm sorry, by "talk,"
I mean in the general sense.

12:01.979 --> 12:03.746
- You happy? Things good?
- Oh, yeah, very.

12:03.748 --> 12:05.748
You see? My open-book
theory was right!

12:05.750 --> 12:07.183
You and Mimi
put it out there

12:07.185 --> 12:09.785
that you were attracted
to each other, and voila!

12:09.787 --> 12:11.821
Casual one-night stand
where no one gets hurt.

12:11.823 --> 12:15.357
Mimi said it was
a casual one-night stand?

12:15.359 --> 12:16.459
I'm sorry, what?

12:16.461 --> 12:18.160
I was just
a body to Mimi?

12:18.162 --> 12:19.462
A piece of flesh?

12:19.464 --> 12:21.163
Um, um...

12:21.165 --> 12:25.701
you know, I may have
misunderstood.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.204
She did say she loved
that weird egg pie you made.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.705
It was a quiche!

12:29.707 --> 12:31.006
Oh, yeah.

12:34.224 --> 12:36.092
Rodrigo, are you okay?

12:36.094 --> 12:37.460
I didn't mean
to upset you earlier.

12:37.462 --> 12:38.928
[scoffs]
I'm fine.

12:38.930 --> 12:40.162
I'm a professional.

12:40.164 --> 12:41.531
You think I'm going to let

12:41.533 --> 12:43.466
some stupid personal drama
affect my work?

12:43.468 --> 12:46.769
[scoffs] [scoffs]
Ridiculous.

12:46.771 --> 12:48.371
[sighs]
We had a good run.

12:48.373 --> 12:50.072
Oh, come on.

12:50.074 --> 12:52.308
Be a man and let
the little girl do your stunt.

12:52.310 --> 12:53.843
- No.
- Fine.

12:53.845 --> 12:55.611
But if you're going
face first,

12:55.613 --> 12:57.747
try to lead with the forehead,
because the nose?

12:57.749 --> 13:01.617
Oy, it'll shatter instantly.

13:01.619 --> 13:05.521
Okay, here we go.
Places!

13:05.523 --> 13:06.889

Rodrigo,
what are you doing?

13:17.035 --> 13:18.167

13:18.169 --> 13:20.169
Come on.

13:20.171 --> 13:21.938
[tiny whimper]

13:21.940 --> 13:24.774
I can't do this,
not with her here.

13:24.776 --> 13:26.976
Her who?
Me? What did I do?

13:26.978 --> 13:28.444
It's what
you didn't do,

13:28.446 --> 13:30.813
i.e., treat me
with respect.

13:30.815 --> 13:33.249
You know, "one-night stand,"
you called it?

13:33.251 --> 13:36.352
Yeah, yeah, surprise, everybody.
Mimi and I slept together.

13:36.354 --> 13:37.653
- Oh!
- [people murmur]

13:37.655 --> 13:39.121
I may have just been
a body to you,

- [laughs nervously]

13:44.228 --> 13:46.362
I know that looks bad.

13:46.364 --> 13:49.031
Uh, are we not
going to do the stunt?

13:49.033 --> 13:50.967
Cool, cool.

13:50.969 --> 13:53.002
I was totally ready.

13:53.004 --> 13:55.972
So Isabela kicked
the whole group of school kids

13:55.974 --> 13:57.073
out of the building.

13:57.075 --> 13:58.407
I believe her quote was,

13:58.409 --> 14:00.376
"Do you want to be
an at-risk youth?

14:00.378 --> 14:02.211
Try smiling at me again."

14:02.213 --> 14:04.981

14:04.983 --> 14:06.649
Between you and me,
it's a blast

14:06.651 --> 14:10.353
to chat with someone who hates
Isabela just as much as I do.

14:10.355 --> 14:13.356
Whoa, I don't
hate Isabela.

14:13.358 --> 14:18.594
Mm, I have 45 minutes on here
that suggest otherwise.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.696

You've been recording me?

14:24.936 --> 14:26.602
Yes!

14:26.604 --> 14:29.238
I had to delete my daughter's
baby pictures to make room.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.007
But it was worth it.

14:31.009 --> 14:32.875
When my tell-all book
comes out,

14:32.877 --> 14:34.543
Isabela's life
will be destroyed.

14:34.545 --> 14:36.679

a mean book?

Isabela's life

14:53.431 --> 14:55.031
Are you still
mad at me?

14:55.033 --> 14:57.233
You said you were going to
keep my secret to yourself.

14:57.235 --> 15:01.170
I feel terrible, but Rodrigo
told me about your night.

15:01.172 --> 15:02.471
He knew maybe I'd know,

15:02.473 --> 15:03.973
and I knew you knew he knew,

15:03.975 --> 15:06.208
so, really,
we all knew, you know?

15:06.210 --> 15:07.877
Why do secrets
have so many rules?

15:07.879 --> 15:11.647
Ana, just admit it!
Your open-book policy is stupid.

15:11.649 --> 15:14.784
Or if everybody told each
other everything at all times,

15:14.786 --> 15:16.285
we wouldn't be
having this fight.

15:16.287 --> 15:18.421
Okay, you want
to know everything?

15:18.423 --> 15:20.423
Rodrigo and I had sex
three times last night.

15:20.425 --> 15:23.259
And after each time it ended,
he'd say, "And scene."

15:23.261 --> 15:24.860
Ah, okay, I admit it!

15:24.862 --> 15:26.395
My open-book theory's wrong.

15:26.397 --> 15:28.064
Ana, your open-book
theory is wrong.

15:28.066 --> 15:29.632
I know;
I just said that.

15:29.634 --> 15:31.867
Oh. Well, why didn't you
tell me that earlier?

15:31.869 --> 15:34.737
Thanks to your advice, I was an
open book with Isabela's twin,

15:34.739 --> 15:37.239
and now there's an actual book,
a tell-all book

15:37.241 --> 15:38.874
full of all the dirt
I gave her.

15:38.876 --> 15:40.543
Oh, my God,
that's awful!

15:40.545 --> 15:43.045
Ana, fix this,
or else I'll tell you

15:43.047 --> 15:45.381
that Rodrigo likes toes,
specifically all ten of my toes,

15:45.383 --> 15:46.916
shoved in his mouth.

15:46.918 --> 15:48.784
[gags] Okay!
All right, I'll fix it!

15:53.958 --> 15:55.591
There she is.

15:55.593 --> 15:57.426
That phone has all
of Isabela's stories on it.

15:57.428 --> 15:58.761
She's leaving.
Stop her!

15:58.763 --> 16:00.362
How am I supposed
to do that?

16:00.364 --> 16:02.431

Do what he'd do.

Figured you'd be
on board, Ana.

Isabela's fights involve you.

a complicated relationship.

we hate each other.

the door open for me.

16:22.754 --> 16:24.286
I mean, she thought
I was someone else,

16:24.288 --> 16:26.288
but she is part
of the show,

16:26.290 --> 16:27.957

embarrass her.

how old we are?

to a decade?

- Ooh, give me that.
- Get it, Ana. Get it. Get it.

16:41.773 --> 16:43.005
- No!

- I'm Isabela.
- Oh, Isabela, thank God.

these lunatics

about you, and they attacked me.

that movie part.

Oh, this was real.

19:00.133 --> 19:02.901
Did your zipper
hold up today?

19:02.903 --> 19:04.936
It didn't, thank you.

19:04.938 --> 19:07.572
I'm currently stuck
in these pants.

19:07.574 --> 19:09.073
Well, you could
let me help you.

19:09.075 --> 19:10.642
I don't want you
to ever touch me again.

19:10.644 --> 19:12.610
I'm sorry for
making you feel bad.

19:12.612 --> 19:15.446
I figured it was a no-strings
thing for you too.

19:15.448 --> 19:16.714
I don't do
one-night stands.

19:16.716 --> 19:18.116
Two, three, maybe four,

19:18.118 --> 19:19.918

need to accomplish.

You mean there was stuff
we didn't do?

19:21.488 --> 19:24.489
A lot of stuff.
Sex isn't casual to me.

19:24.491 --> 19:26.891
I want the woman that
I'm with to feel amazing.

19:26.893 --> 19:28.493
And I did!

19:28.495 --> 19:30.762
Rodrigo, this may not sound
romantic,

19:30.764 --> 19:34.966
but last night felt amazing
to me because it was so casual.

19:34.968 --> 19:37.068
All I do is stress
about work or the kids,

19:37.070 --> 19:39.137
and it was nice
for just one evening

19:39.139 --> 19:40.838
not to think
about any of that,

19:40.840 --> 19:44.175
to just think about
myself for a change.

19:44.177 --> 19:45.510
I did that for you?

19:45.512 --> 19:48.980
Oh, you made me feel
very special.

19:48.982 --> 19:51.983
I guess this means
Ana's open-book mantra

19:51.985 --> 19:54.752
had some merit, not that
she needs to hear that.

19:54.754 --> 19:56.087
That can be our new secret,

19:56.089 --> 19:58.790
since everyone knows
about our old one.

19:58.792 --> 20:01.826
Well, they don't know
we spent another night together.

20:01.828 --> 20:04.162
Oh. [giggles] Did we?

20:04.164 --> 20:07.832
I guess I need help
getting out of these pants.

20:07.834 --> 20:09.367
Oh, then I'll go get
my scissors.

20:09.369 --> 20:10.802
Oh, oh, okay.

20:10.804 --> 20:12.237

Oh, I'm so happy
we're gonna be friends now!

20:15.408 --> 20:17.374
No, we're not friends.

20:17.376 --> 20:19.009
But as a reward for
your loyalty.

20:19.011 --> 20:20.711
I was going to tell you
one personal tidbit

20:20.713 --> 20:22.680
that you might
find interesting--

20:22.682 --> 20:24.081
my age.

Glad you decided
you're no longer
