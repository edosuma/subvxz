WEBVTT

00:48.382 --> 00:51.260
She's still in that uniform,
still wearing that badge.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.719
It's not hard for her to get in a door.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.812
Everyone, please go back inside.

01:01.812 --> 01:02.980
Thank you.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.232
Yeah, it's all right. Everything's okay.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.316
Paul.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.278
How'd she get away?

01:10.821 --> 01:12.030
You think I let her go?

01:14.283 --> 01:16.118
- Why would he let her go?
- I don't know.

01:16.118 --> 01:18.704
- I sent him home for the time being.
- Where the fuck is she?

01:18.704 --> 01:20.497
Amundsen and his team searched the level,

01:20.497 --> 01:22.791
every apartment, every closet,
under every bed--

01:22.791 --> 01:25.002
What, has she mastered
the art of invisibility?

01:25.002 --> 01:26.837
'Cause that's a skill
I'd really love to learn.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.255
It's possible she circled around

01:28.255 --> 01:30.048
or climbed up or down
the far side of the shaft.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.925
- Have you searched that level?
- We did.

01:31.925 --> 01:35.804
I also brought in all off-duty watchers.
We have eyes on every screen.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.849
Have them track her movement yesterday.
Maybe that'll tell us something.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.602
I think we have to assume
she somehow got off that level,

01:41.602 --> 01:43.395
maybe made it back to the stairs.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.899
I'm gonna have Amundsen talk to anyone
who might give her shelter.

01:56.283 --> 02:00.037
Rob, I hope you understand
what we're facing here.

02:01.747 --> 02:02.748
Go.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.929
Talk to her friends, family.
See if anyone's hiding her.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.683
I'm gonna need an escort.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.317
Paul.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.367
Honey.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.374
I lost my grip.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.668
- It's not your fault.
- No.

02:48.627 --> 02:49.628
It is my fault.

02:51.380 --> 02:54.383
You ask me if I'm okay, I feel fine.

02:54.925 --> 02:58.428
Physically, I feel normal,
but look at this.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.808
Even now, my hands won't stop.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.893
All these medicines and herbs--

03:06.353 --> 03:08.939
At this point, I'd rather people just know
I have the Syndrome

03:08.939 --> 03:10.399
than think I'm incompetent.

03:10.399 --> 03:11.692
You're not incompetent.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.735
You worked hard to get where you are.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.446
But maybe it's time.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.450
- For what?
- To go back to Judicial.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.618
They liked you there.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.496
You did well and it didn't have
the same kinds of requirements.

03:24.496 --> 03:25.789
I'm not going back to Judicial.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.666
Your plan is to tell them
you have the Syndrome

03:27.666 --> 03:30.294
and hope they look past it,
ignore the Pact?

03:30.294 --> 03:33.589
I wasn't being serious, Kat.
I was just saying how I feel.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.007
You lied, Paul.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.301
Yes, you earned the job that you have,

03:37.301 --> 03:39.678
but by not telling them
about your condition.

03:40.179 --> 03:43.348
So if going back to Judicial
is what allows you

03:43.348 --> 03:45.851
- to move forward--
- I am more than qualified to do this job.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.603
I am not saying that you're not!

03:47.603 --> 03:51.648
But one sheriff was already sent out
to clean and the other was on their way,

03:51.648 --> 03:53.400
and neither of them had children!

03:54.067 --> 03:55.485
So when you think of your secrets

03:55.485 --> 03:58.071
and your pride
about what you're qualified to do,

03:58.071 --> 04:00.616
picture your daughter
growing up without you.

04:01.617 --> 04:02.618
Think about that.

04:03.118 --> 04:06.163
Kat, that's not fair.

04:06.997 --> 04:07.998
It's the truth.

04:23.138 --> 04:25.724
When I was 17, there was another kid,

04:27.017 --> 04:29.311
Justin Carlson, who had the Syndrome.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.524
Most kids didn't know, but I knew.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.277
I saw him trying to hide it
the same way I did.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.572
And he knew I had it too.

04:42.658 --> 04:46.828
One day, he approached me
and asked me about it

04:46.828 --> 04:49.581
like he was trying to make a friend.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.587
I hit him so hard,
I knocked one of his teeth out.

04:58.465 --> 05:03.929
I told him if he ever told anyone,
or if he ever talked to me again,

05:04.847 --> 05:06.223
I'd hit him harder.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.685
That's how important it was
for me to keep that secret,

05:10.477 --> 05:13.355
to keep people from knowing
that I had some defect,

05:13.355 --> 05:16.108
that I was someone the Pact said
could only have a job

05:16.108 --> 05:18.902
with no physical requirement
because I was different.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.658
I am not limited by what others think

05:24.658 --> 05:25.993
- I'm capable of...
- Paul, honey.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.953
...and I'm allowed to make mistakes.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.836
I'm allowed to make mistakes.

05:37.421 --> 05:38.672
What are you doing?

05:40.132 --> 05:42.134
I'm gonna catch the person I let go.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.220
I'm gonna make this right.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.913
- Hank.
- Walker.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.916
This about Jules?

06:13.916 --> 06:16.793
I tried to tell 'em
Mechanical runs like a fine-oiled machine

06:16.793 --> 06:20.881
'cause of the hardworking citizens who
put the safety of the Silo above all else.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.467
Yet, here they are.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.551
Yeah.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.263
Well, come on in.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.182
I ain't got shit to hide.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.861
She didn't wake up
for her 5:00 a.m. feeding.

06:43.612 --> 06:44.738
I'm so tired.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.407
I didn't wake up until 6:00 and I--

06:47.407 --> 06:48.617
Denise, it's okay.

06:48.617 --> 06:51.328
- I'm a terrible mother.
- No. No, you're not.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.288
You're just exhausted.

06:53.789 --> 06:56.792
Look. Claudia's just fine.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.003
- What are you doing?
- Peter Nichols.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.881
- We're in the middle of a--
- Do you know where your daughter is?

07:02.881 --> 07:05.676
- You'll wake the baby.
- Do you know where your daughter is?

07:05.676 --> 07:07.678
No. Now please leave.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.556
I think you better do as he says.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.935
If you wake the baby,
this poor woman might just kill you.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.748
I remember when getting our boy to sleep
was the highest achievement of the day.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.460
What do you want with my daughter?

07:40.961 --> 07:41.962
Dr. Nichols,

07:42.462 --> 07:46.508
I imagine Juliette is the most
important person in the world to you,

07:47.259 --> 07:49.761
but for the sake of everyone in the Silo,

07:49.761 --> 07:51.889
I need you to tell me where she might be.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.683
She is the most important person to me,

07:55.893 --> 07:58.729
but I don't know how she thinks
or where she might go.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.024
Until this week, I hadn't seen her
in 20 years.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.736
- What happened?
- She said she wanted to go out.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.030
Now the whole Silo is looking for her.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.908
Help me find her
before some overeager raider does.

08:11.783 --> 08:15.871
If that's meant to be a warning,
I don't need it. I know all about them.

08:16.997 --> 08:17.998
I guess you do.

08:18.874 --> 08:22.920
There's a spot
halfway around the level one balcony

08:24.254 --> 08:26.089
where the railing is worn smooth

08:26.089 --> 08:29.301
by all the people who have
gripped it tight before going over.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.472
I never imagined
my wife would be one of them.

08:34.472 --> 08:38.434
But thanks to your raiders,
Jules is all I have left.

08:39.561 --> 08:44.316
Let me ask you, Mr. Sims,
if you were in my position,

08:45.526 --> 08:47.778
would you help
the people hunting your child?

08:47.778 --> 08:48.862
I would,

08:50.489 --> 08:55.035
'cause no one person is more important
than the 10,000 or the thousands to come.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.165
I have no idea where she is.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.186
Why did they close school?

09:21.186 --> 09:24.690
It's just a special day, honey.
I don't have to go to work either.

09:24.690 --> 09:28.151
It'll just be you and me.
Grilled cheese for lunch.

09:29.528 --> 09:30.946
Is Daddy coming home?

09:30.946 --> 09:32.656
Daddy is gonna be very busy today.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.366
I made something for him.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.581
That's lovely.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.583
Just gonna make one for your dad
and not your mom?

09:42.583 --> 09:44.084
I made one for you too, Mom.

09:44.751 --> 09:48.088
- Mrs. Sims?
- Yes?

09:48.088 --> 09:51.258
Your husband sent us
to escort you both home from school.

09:51.842 --> 09:52.885
Well, you're a little late.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.845
- Our door is right here.
- Apologies, ma'am.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.264
Could we at least
make sure you get in okay?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.348
All right.

10:05.439 --> 10:06.440
Okay. We're in.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.234
- You mind if we check inside?
- You're not setting foot inside my home.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.111
But you can tell my husband
you did your job.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.280
- Ma'am.
- I was a raider for 12 years

10:13.280 --> 10:15.908
before I moved over to IT.
I can take care of myself.

10:15.908 --> 10:17.618
Yes, ma'am, but we'd really feel better--

10:17.618 --> 10:20.454
You two drew a lot of attention
running up, yelling my name.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.247
You think my husband would like that?

10:42.643 --> 10:45.187
Okay. Come on.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.236
There we go.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.530
Everything okay, Mommy?

10:55.781 --> 10:56.782
Yeah.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.994
Yeah, baby. Everything's fine.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.206
You just stay in here
and get your homework out.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.041
I'll make you a snack, okay?

11:06.667 --> 11:08.043
- Yeah.
- Excuse me?

11:08.544 --> 11:10.337
- Yes, Mommy.
- Okay.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.132
I'm not gonna hurt you
but I will if I have to.

13:31.395 --> 13:32.980
I love it, baby.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.358
Why don't you hang on to it for me, okay?

13:37.860 --> 13:38.861
Yes, ma'am.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.072
I'm gonna close the door,
but everything's all right.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.158
I just need to talk to
this person from work.

13:46.243 --> 13:47.244
Yes, ma'am.

14:01.550 --> 14:03.677
- You know how to use that?
- No, not really.

14:04.178 --> 14:06.180
I figured you're so close,
it doesn't really matter.

14:06.180 --> 14:07.347
There's only one shot in there.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.432
How many will I need?

14:09.391 --> 14:11.018
Look, I'm not here to hurt you.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.853
- You said that.
- I'm saying it again.

14:15.939 --> 14:18.483
- Are these mine?
- Yeah. Your husband took mine.

14:20.194 --> 14:21.904
Cuff yourself to the rail in the bathroom.

14:21.904 --> 14:22.988
No.

14:22.988 --> 14:26.033
Look. Me firing this gun,
whether I hit you or not,

14:26.033 --> 14:29.328
it's gonna be enough to give your son
nightmares for the rest of his life.

14:29.328 --> 14:30.454
You want that?

14:30.454 --> 14:34.249
I'm not going any place where I can't see
both you and the door to my son's bedroom.

14:38.629 --> 14:40.214
Kitchen. Now.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.141
Really?

15:33.141 --> 15:34.476
I've done more with less.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.145
By the sound of it, so have you.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.368
What are you doing?

16:05.090 --> 16:06.466
Deputy, you can't come in here.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.969
The judge said only Judicial investigators
are allowed inside.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.889
As acting sheriff, I have a responsibility
to conduct an investigation

16:11.889 --> 16:14.683
into anyone who requests to go outside.

16:14.683 --> 16:17.686
And I have orders to arrest anyone
who tries to get past me.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.109
Sir, I don't know if you remember me,

16:24.109 --> 16:26.612
but I took your class on the Pact
last year.

16:28.322 --> 16:30.240
- Jean?
- Robinson.

16:30.908 --> 16:34.536
Look, if it was up to me,
I'd let you inside, but I can't.

16:34.536 --> 16:37.831
As you know, I don't have a choice.
I have to do what they say.

16:38.749 --> 16:42.377
- Can you tell me if she left a note?
- No note. This place was a mess.

16:46.590 --> 16:50.886
I was just thinking if I found out
why she said she had to go out,

16:51.553 --> 16:53.305
maybe I could figure out where she is.

16:54.973 --> 16:55.974
I don't know.

16:56.808 --> 16:57.976
But you should go, sir.

17:07.736 --> 17:09.570
So, who was it that gave you nightmares?

17:12.156 --> 17:14.576
That's not something you say
if you don't have them yourself.

17:15.911 --> 17:17.329
You said you were a raider.

17:18.914 --> 17:22.209
You know, when I was a little girl
about the same age your son is now,

17:22.209 --> 17:23.961
someone like you broke down our door.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.128
They destroyed our apartment, my family.

17:27.047 --> 17:30.717
That's Judicial. That's who you used to
work for and who your husband works for.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.469
My husband works for the good of the Silo.

17:32.469 --> 17:35.013
- You believe in the good of the Silo?
- I do.

17:35.013 --> 17:39.935
But not enough to let two raiders
into your apartment where your son sleeps.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.688
Even though your husband sent them.

17:43.188 --> 17:46.149
My husband's not in control of
everything that happens in the Silo.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.734
And he's certainly not responsible

17:47.734 --> 17:49.862
for something that happened to you
when you were a child.

17:49.862 --> 17:52.447
You have no idea
what your husband is responsible for.

17:52.447 --> 17:55.784
And what do you think will happen
when he finds out where you are right now?

18:49.046 --> 18:50.047
Come in.

18:51.340 --> 18:55.761
I spoke to her father. Our Down Deep team
checked out her friends in Mechanical.

18:55.761 --> 18:56.887
None of them have her.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.348
Did you send teams anywhere else?

19:00.516 --> 19:02.142
Just those places for now.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.354
The watchers tracked
where Nichols went yesterday.

19:05.354 --> 19:08.482
Most of it normal
until she went to the Dispatch on ten.

19:08.482 --> 19:10.734
Hired a porter to deliver a message.

19:10.734 --> 19:12.736
The sheriff's department
has its own porters.

19:12.736 --> 19:15.322
Yeah, I know.
I sent an agent up to check it out.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.992
The message was delivered
to someone in the cafeteria.

19:19.660 --> 19:20.786
Cafeteria worker?

19:20.786 --> 19:23.288
No, someone who was just sitting there.

19:24.289 --> 19:27.501
Lukas Kyle, works in IT.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.753
We don't know what the message said,

19:29.753 --> 19:32.256
but we do know what Mr. Kyle did
after he got it.

19:33.257 --> 19:34.716
He went to Nichols's apartment.

23:48.220 --> 23:53.183
Would you consider yourself
a curious person, Mr. Kyle?

23:55.227 --> 23:56.228
No--

23:57.062 --> 24:00.816
I mean, not more than anyone else is, sir.

24:01.942 --> 24:07.447
But I understand that you like to
go up to the cafeteria at night

24:07.447 --> 24:10.325
and chart the lights in the sky.
Is that true?

24:10.993 --> 24:13.328
It's just a hobby to pass the time.

24:14.162 --> 24:19.168
I would say that
I am more analytical than curious.

24:19.751 --> 24:20.752
Analytical?

24:22.671 --> 24:26.675
It's why I like working here in IT.

24:26.675 --> 24:29.386
You know, here I get to use--

24:29.386 --> 24:33.182
Do you have any idea what they are?

24:34.558 --> 24:35.559
The lights.

24:36.727 --> 24:37.978
No, sir.

24:37.978 --> 24:39.146
Any guesses?

24:44.318 --> 24:45.777
What about Sheriff Nichols?

24:46.612 --> 24:48.780
Does she have any idea
what the lights are?

24:50.490 --> 24:53.577
Lukas, yesterday when the sheriff
sent you a message by porter,

24:53.577 --> 24:57.789
you went directly to her apartment
where you had a conversation.

24:58.290 --> 25:02.920
It was hard to hear
over the water that she left running.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.880
Nichols then broke her mirror,

25:05.547 --> 25:08.133
destroying the air quality monitor
behind it.

25:08.133 --> 25:09.843
A criminal offense.

25:11.220 --> 25:15.224
And then on top of that,
she showed you a hard drive.

25:15.224 --> 25:16.683
A restricted one.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.977
And what did you do?

25:21.438 --> 25:25.025
I-- Well, nothing. I didn't do anything.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.109
Exactly.

25:27.569 --> 25:31.365
The sheriff showed you
a restricted red-level relic,

25:31.949 --> 25:33.951
and you told no one.

25:35.160 --> 25:39.164
A Judicial security team
even came to her apartment,

25:39.957 --> 25:42.042
giving you the opportunity to alert them,

25:42.668 --> 25:45.420
and you slinked away.

25:45.420 --> 25:48.423
I didn't know
that it was a red-level relic, sir. I--

25:48.423 --> 25:51.468
Tell me, you're an analytical person.

25:52.344 --> 25:56.974
So, what do you think the consequences
should be for such an inaction?

26:00.060 --> 26:01.603
Sir, the consequences?

26:01.603 --> 26:06.525
Come on. You're a smart man.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be in IT.

26:08.652 --> 26:13.031
I mean, before today,
while I wouldn't have known your face,

26:13.532 --> 26:16.118
I am certainly familiar
with your performance numbers,

26:16.118 --> 26:17.327
and they are quite high.

26:18.704 --> 26:20.372
So, consequences.

26:22.833 --> 26:26.712
How about the scavenge room?

26:28.213 --> 26:29.339
The mines?

26:29.339 --> 26:32.467
Considering the scope of your betrayal,

26:32.467 --> 26:36.430
maybe a cleaning would be
more appropriate.

26:36.430 --> 26:38.265
Mr. Holland, please, I--

26:38.265 --> 26:43.103
With 10,000 of your fellow citizens
depending on your judgment,

26:44.438 --> 26:46.732
you turned a blind eye.

26:46.732 --> 26:47.816
Why?

26:48.817 --> 26:52.696
Because of a... crush?

26:57.743 --> 27:01.538
I'm not sure
I see another way out for you...

27:04.625 --> 27:08.253
unless you help us find her.

27:08.253 --> 27:11.465
I have no idea where she is.

27:11.465 --> 27:14.801
What did she want from you?

27:15.427 --> 27:18.639
Just help with the hard drive,
but I didn't help her.

27:18.639 --> 27:21.850
Describe it to me.
The hard drive, describe it to me.

27:21.850 --> 27:24.311
- It's old--
- What else?

27:24.311 --> 27:25.854
It's beat-up. It--

27:25.854 --> 27:27.231
Was there a serial number?

27:27.231 --> 27:29.233
- I didn't look at it that closely.
- Bullshit!

27:29.233 --> 27:31.693
You're lying to me. What else?

27:31.693 --> 27:35.781
There was a number on it.

27:37.324 --> 27:39.701
Not a serial number, just a n--

27:39.701 --> 27:41.203
Yes. What number?

27:41.870 --> 27:43.956
A number, 18.

27:50.045 --> 27:52.339
Put him somewhere.
Don't let him talk to anyone.

27:53.215 --> 27:54.758
- What is it?
- Come with me.

28:11.525 --> 28:13.402
I need a system-wide scan
for a hard drive.

28:13.402 --> 28:14.695
Serial number 18.

28:14.695 --> 28:17.155
Sir, serial numbers have nine digits.

28:17.155 --> 28:21.159
This has two, a one followed by an eight,
otherwise known as 18. Find it!

29:04.203 --> 29:05.495
You okay?

29:05.996 --> 29:09.583
I've been very negligent
in appointing a shadow.

29:11.502 --> 29:14.213
And I know you think
it should be you, Robert,

29:14.213 --> 29:19.301
but earlier today, you had Amundsen
send agents

29:19.301 --> 29:22.513
to accompany your wife when she
walked your son home from school.

29:24.348 --> 29:27.017
We are facing extinction,

29:27.601 --> 29:30.979
and you chose
to protect your family before the Silo.

29:30.979 --> 29:34.191
I suppose that
is completely understandable.

29:37.236 --> 29:40.739
But now I wonder
whether making you my shadow

29:40.739 --> 29:47.037
would be fair to you, your wife,
your son, or the Silo.

29:47.746 --> 29:48.914
Got it.

29:49.414 --> 29:52.501
That drive is connected to a computer
in an apartment on level 17.

29:52.501 --> 29:56.213
- Seventeen?
- Yes, sir. Apartment 114.

29:57.256 --> 29:59.007
Gotta be fucking kidding me.

29:59.800 --> 30:02.052
Clear the stairs all the way to level 17!

30:02.052 --> 30:04.972
Get every available raider,
levels above and below.

30:23.824 --> 30:25.450
With me. Come with me!

30:31.540 --> 30:33.125
- <i>Hey, Jules.</i>
- What?

30:33.125 --> 30:37.129
<i>Pretty crazy, right? This is a video.</i>

30:38.088 --> 30:40.299
<i>Or at least that's what they called it
in the before-times.</i>

30:41.133 --> 30:44.678
<i>I'm making it
on an old camera that I found.</i>

30:45.929 --> 30:49.808
<i>It was on its last legs, but
I got it working, because I'm a genius.</i>

30:51.018 --> 30:53.645
<i>Hopefully, you're watching this
and I'm right next to you,</i>

30:53.645 --> 30:55.689
<i>watching your reaction. But if not,</i>

30:55.689 --> 30:57.441
<i>and you're watching without me--</i>

30:57.941 --> 31:02.529
<i>Well, first off, that means you found
all the clues I left behind.</i>

31:03.488 --> 31:06.200
<i>But if you're watching it alone,
that also means</i>

31:06.200 --> 31:08.827
<i>that Judicial found out
that I have the hard drive,</i>

31:09.536 --> 31:12.372
<i>and things haven't gone the way I wanted.</i>

31:14.458 --> 31:19.463
<i>Please know that I never meant
to put you in any danger.</i>

31:20.756 --> 31:25.511
<i>But, Jules, there is stuff on this drive
that people need to see.</i>

31:26.053 --> 31:27.221
<i>The truth.</i>

31:28.096 --> 31:28.931
Stop.

31:31.058 --> 31:32.100
Stop.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.436
<i>You should also know that I...</i>

31:34.436 --> 31:37.064
The second you connected that drive,
they knew where you were.

31:37.064 --> 31:42.110
You can either run right now,
or keep watching and die.

31:46.698 --> 31:48.867
- Let's go.
- Come on!

31:54.998 --> 31:58.001
Shit. Oh, shit.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.711
All the alleyway cameras
are going dark too.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.526
Wait.

32:37.332 --> 32:40.169
Hey, you all right? Are you okay?

32:41.086 --> 32:42.379
Anthony, are you okay?

32:49.928 --> 32:51.513
How does she keep getting away?

33:05.611 --> 33:06.820
Next.

33:08.071 --> 33:11.783
- Travel restrictions remain in effect.
- Yeah, I'm IT.

33:12.534 --> 33:14.661
How is IT travel essential today?

33:14.661 --> 33:17.122
Well, it isn't to me,
but it is to my boss.

33:20.918 --> 33:22.127
Thank you.

33:36.058 --> 33:37.726
- Hey.
- This better be important, Patrick.

33:37.726 --> 33:39.978
I had to lie my way past a bunch
of fucking checkpoints.

33:41.230 --> 33:42.356
You think I'm gonna spend ten credits

33:42.356 --> 33:45.025
on a message if it wasn't important?
No. Get in.

33:46.193 --> 33:47.194
Come on.

33:48.028 --> 33:51.990
I promised my asshole boss
I'd work weekends for m--

33:55.827 --> 33:57.204
Patrick, why is the sheriff here?

33:58.705 --> 34:02.501
- I'm pretty sure she's the ex-sheriff now.
- Better question, why am I here?

34:02.501 --> 34:05.420
'Cause you're a part of a ring
that hacks the Silo's security network

34:05.420 --> 34:08.130
and fences stolen goods
from the marketplace.

34:09.591 --> 34:12.886
- You traitorous fuck!
- Hey, I said you were the best.

34:12.886 --> 34:14.679
- Why are you helping a cop?
- I saved his life.

34:14.679 --> 34:18.350
She likes to think that that's why,
but really, I'm doing it for that watch.

34:18.350 --> 34:19.976
I've got a job for you.

34:21.353 --> 34:23.397
- You got another watch for me?
- No.

34:23.397 --> 34:26.233
- Well, then I'm not interested.
- Yeah, you are.

34:31.154 --> 34:35.117
- Oh, shit. George Wilkins.
- Yeah.

35:32.508 --> 35:34.301
There's a file I need
to finish looking at.

35:34.927 --> 35:37.679
- Why do you need me for that?
- Needs a computer with SysOp clearance,

35:37.679 --> 35:40.224
- and they wouldn't give one to a criminal...
- Wow.

35:40.224 --> 35:42.476
Not easy, but I can get around it.

35:43.060 --> 35:45.479
And they're looking for that drive,
so as soon as you plug it in,

35:45.479 --> 35:47.189
they'll come running.

35:47.189 --> 35:51.318
- That's a little harder but doable.
- There.

35:51.944 --> 35:54.821
I can make 'em think it's coming
from somewhere else in the Silo.

35:54.821 --> 35:56.949
Anywhere you want
to send a team of raiders?

35:56.949 --> 35:59.409
Old boyfriend? Boss?

35:59.409 --> 36:01.078
How about that asshole on 98?

36:01.745 --> 36:03.580
One who turned you in on the counterfeit?

36:04.248 --> 36:05.249
Done.

36:08.168 --> 36:11.171
I spent years trying to crack this drive
before I sold it to Regina.

36:11.171 --> 36:13.757
It was just collecting dust
by the time she offered me a trade.

36:13.757 --> 36:17.094
Then she gave it to George.
Holston's wife did these?

36:17.094 --> 36:18.512
Yeah.

36:18.512 --> 36:20.931
Data recovery.
No wonder she went out to clean.

36:22.057 --> 36:25.644
She got around the directory problem.
George couldn't crack it.

36:30.107 --> 36:34.611
Wow. There's, like,
thousands and thousands of files here.

36:34.611 --> 36:36.613
How am I supposed to know where to start?

36:37.990 --> 36:39.616
How about there?

36:40.742 --> 36:42.661
Yeah, that's actually very helpful.

36:46.790 --> 36:52.421
<i>Hey, Jules. Pretty crazy, right?
This is a video.</i>

36:53.005 --> 36:54.715
What the actual fuck?

37:14.693 --> 37:17.112
Got it. It's on 98.

37:17.112 --> 37:20.157
She was on 17.
How the fuck did she get to 98?

37:21.074 --> 37:25.871
<i>The truth. Since I'm being honest,</i>

37:25.871 --> 37:29.458
<i>you should also know
that I transferred to Mechanical</i>

37:29.458 --> 37:32.711
<i>so that I could find someone
to use as a guide down here.</i>

37:32.711 --> 37:38.675
<i>And it didn't take long for me to realize
that the know-it-all down here is you.</i>

37:40.135 --> 37:44.723
<i>My plan was to get all
the knowledge you could provide,</i>

37:44.723 --> 37:46.808
<i>and then leave you behind.</i>

37:47.851 --> 37:50.187
<i>But then the most annoying thing happened.</i>

37:50.187 --> 37:53.732
<i>I fell in love with you.</i>

37:57.903 --> 37:59.279
<i>Anyway...</i>

38:01.615 --> 38:03.659
<i>I wanted to tell you today</i>

38:03.659 --> 38:07.246
<i>at Cooper's shadow party that I found
the door I've been looking for.</i>

38:07.246 --> 38:12.000
<i>It's huge. Maybe 15 feet high. Metal.</i>

38:12.000 --> 38:14.127
<i>I can't get through it. Maybe you can.</i>

38:15.587 --> 38:18.799
<i>I'm guessing you're wondering
what I did about the water.</i>

38:18.799 --> 38:22.386
<i>Well, turns out
it was nothing to worry about.</i>

38:22.386 --> 38:27.015
<i>Anyway, Jules, the important thing
is the door is down there.</i>

38:27.891 --> 38:29.643
<i>You have to find it.</i>

39:05.095 --> 39:05.929
<i>I--</i>

39:06.430 --> 39:10.684
<i>I'm recording this video
in case I don't make it,</i>

39:11.768 --> 39:16.565
<i>but people need to know
why Allison Becker went out to clean.</i>

39:17.065 --> 39:19.151
<i>Remember what she said
when she asked to go out?</i>

39:19.735 --> 39:25.073
<i>On here, look for the file labeled
"Jane Carmody Cleaning."</i>

39:25.908 --> 39:27.284
<i>You'll see why.</i>

39:27.284 --> 39:29.828
I wish I had gotten here sooner.

39:30.412 --> 39:35.167
It's a good thing you didn't.
I let her go, Rob.

39:35.167 --> 39:38.086
You what? Why would you do that?

39:38.086 --> 39:39.630
- Just listen.
- To what?

39:39.630 --> 39:42.299
You had her right here and you let her go?

39:42.299 --> 39:45.385
I knew you were coming with a bunch
of raiders with their fingers on triggers.

39:45.385 --> 39:48.805
- No, I gave them orders not to fire.
- I've been given those orders.

39:49.389 --> 39:50.933
I know what can happen.

39:55.312 --> 40:00.651
We have one goal, one ambition,
and we will not lose sight of that.

40:02.736 --> 40:04.530
- What?
- Bernard, he--

40:05.197 --> 40:08.033
he found out I had an escort
bringing you and Anthony home,

40:08.033 --> 40:11.078
and now he's wondering
if I'm the wrong person to shadow him.

40:16.124 --> 40:18.502
Tell me exactly what he said, Rob.

40:18.502 --> 40:23.340
I can't get into that now.
I have to get back.

40:23.966 --> 40:25.092
Dad.

40:27.386 --> 40:29.513
Anthony, honey,
I told you to stay in your room.

40:29.513 --> 40:33.058
Everything is okay now, Son. Promise.

40:33.058 --> 40:35.394
Daddy's not gonna let anything
happen to you.

40:35.394 --> 40:37.437
You want your father
to protect us, don't you?

40:39.147 --> 40:43.151
So do I.
We have to let him go so he can do that.

40:43.151 --> 40:45.988
Are you gonna send that lady out to clean?

40:45.988 --> 40:48.156
- We'll see.
- I hope you do.

40:49.157 --> 40:51.952
I don't ever want her to ever come back.

40:57.624 --> 41:01.420
<i>I gotta go hide this drive
and then head back up.</i>

41:01.420 --> 41:03.964
<i>One more thing before I go,</i>

41:05.215 --> 41:08.635
<i>I'm so happy that I got
to be the lucky bastard</i>

41:08.635 --> 41:11.180
<i>in this fucked-up place who got
