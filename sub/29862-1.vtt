gone for the pancakes.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.106
And given her the satisfaction?

05:44.311 --> 05:46.278
So when'd you start
sleeping on the couch?

05:47.381 --> 05:52.284
No, I just keep on passing out
in front of the TV.

05:52.286 --> 05:55.187
I mean,
not that I blame you.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.557
Pretty shitty thing,
what she did.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.959
Hey, hey.
None of that.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.968
So, what, you getting
into fights now?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.570
They were being assholes.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.105
That's no excuse.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.941
Look...

06:16.877 --> 06:18.977
I know things between
your mom and me--

06:18.979 --> 06:20.278
Has nothing to do with this.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.453
So how'd the other kid look?

06:29.256 --> 06:30.655

08:46.727 --> 08:49.227
[receptionist] Dr. Harper,
your nine o'clock is here.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.905
[woman]
Justin Whitter, 10 years old.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.641
Went missing on a bike ride
last night near Troubadour Park.

09:02.643 --> 09:05.043
Park ranger
found the bike, no boy.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.412
Just like Michael King?

09:07.414 --> 09:09.814
No, we don't know if
the two are connected.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.082
Michael King was abducted

09:11.084 --> 09:12.717
cycling to a corner store
in the city.

09:12.719 --> 09:16.321
Justin Whitter, local boy.
Good home, respected family.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.589
He went missing on county lines,

09:17.591 --> 09:19.691
but as of nine o'clock
this morning

09:19.693 --> 09:21.159
the case was ruled ours.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.362
Does Spitz know about this?

09:24.364 --> 09:26.498
It's up to him if
he wants to get involved.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.467
He'll wanna get involved.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.837
I'll let you
manage the situation
as you see fit.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.940
You're lead on this.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.174
Got it.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.915

Connor?

10:50.117 --> 10:51.316
Connor?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.354
[screams, gasps]
Whoa! Whoa.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.323
I'm just a window repairman.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.192
What are you doing here?
Your husband called
about a broken window.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.694
Just finished putting
in a new one for you.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.263
Oh, my God.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.799
[repairman] Okeydokey.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.434
Just give me a jingle if you
have any problems with it,

11:09.436 --> 11:11.036
and have a good day.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.137
Thank you.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.039
I'm sorry, who let you in?

11:14.041 --> 11:15.874
That kid of yours.
Very polite.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.643
You trained her well.
[phone ringing]

11:18.645 --> 11:20.679
Who?
[repairman] Yeah, John. No.

11:25.318 --> 11:28.153
And the truth is,
anything you find

11:28.155 --> 11:30.321
could be important.

11:30.323 --> 11:35.293
Justin was last seen
wearing a green soccer jersey
and carrying--

11:35.295 --> 11:37.495
[detective]
Gonna want answers, and fast.

11:37.497 --> 11:41.332
So the kid's riding his bike
all alone through the woods.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.134
The parents are okay with that?

11:43.136 --> 11:45.537
[detective] He's 10.
Figure he's old enough.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.074
[Greg] How's the home life?
You know, really.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.742
Mom, dad, two happy kids.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.978
Perfect all-American family.
[phone ringing]

11:53.980 --> 11:55.580
Yeah.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.716
Aren't they all?

11:57.718 --> 12:00.885
Lisa and I went through
that rough patch last year.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.387
Hey, come on, Spitz.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.489
Look,

12:04.491 --> 12:06.324
I'm not saying I know anything.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.093
Just there was this counselor.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.894
Jackie is a counselor.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.397
[sighs] Yeah.
We'll be fine.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.165
[man]
There's something up here!

12:15.936 --> 12:18.269
[shutter clicks]

12:18.271 --> 12:20.572
All right, step away.
What you got?

12:26.780 --> 12:28.446
Jesus Christ.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.583
[policewoman] Sir,
should we bring it in?

12:32.619 --> 12:34.119
Yeah.
Yeah, you can...

12:35.388 --> 12:36.588
You can bag it.

12:37.557 --> 12:38.690
Thanks, Kayla.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.261
Spitz.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.931
You okay?

12:46.933 --> 12:49.534
You remember Cole Gordon?
It was before your time.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.769
Oh, of course I remember.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.036
The green knives.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.773
Six boys.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.242
All found buried
with those knives.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.543
Yeah, I know.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.312
But Gordon, he's--

13:01.314 --> 13:02.547
Yeah, yeah,
I helped put him there,

13:02.549 --> 13:04.149
and he ain't getting out.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.550
So what're you thinking?

13:10.223 --> 13:11.389
[slurping]

13:26.606 --> 13:28.206
Could you pass the dressing?

13:35.482 --> 13:36.815
Thank you.

13:38.518 --> 13:42.053
Hey, did you let a repairman in
today when I wasn't here?

13:42.856 --> 13:44.656
Jesus, Mom,
is that who it was?

13:46.193 --> 13:47.892
Did you screw a repairman?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.032
Okay.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.301
Okay, you're angry.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.669
How could you do that?

13:59.673 --> 14:01.372
How could you do that to Dad?

14:07.013 --> 14:08.413
Who was it?

14:10.183 --> 14:11.983
Just someone, sweetie--

14:11.985 --> 14:14.285
Oh, you don't get
to call me that.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.055
You don't ever get
to call me that again.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.489
I see how mad you are.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.458
You don't get to act
like nothing happened!

14:20.460 --> 14:22.994
You think pancakes
and fancy dinners
are gonna make it up?

14:22.996 --> 14:26.531
No, I don't--
You ruined our family and
you should fucking pay for it!

Your dad hated me

I wouldn't provide for you

21:21.147 --> 21:22.280
What're you doing?

21:25.318 --> 21:26.450
Where were you?

21:27.086 --> 21:28.319
I was thirsty.

21:30.256 --> 21:33.190
It's a little late
to be playing video games,
isn't it?

21:35.895 --> 21:37.461
I'm taking you
to school tomorrow.

21:37.463 --> 21:38.729
What? Why?

21:38.731 --> 21:39.997
Doesn't matter,
I'm just taking you.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.966
I'm not gonna
get kidnapped, Mom.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.502
Oh, my God, I haven't
seen him in forever.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.239
Hippie. Remember him?

21:48.841 --> 21:49.974
No.

22:06.192 --> 22:07.425
Mom.

22:11.264 --> 22:12.530
Good night.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.737
[phone ringing]

22:59.712 --> 23:00.978
Hello.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.913
[Spitz]
<i>Davis wants to see us. Now.</i>

23:02.915 --> 23:04.949
Yeah, okay.
I'll be right there.

23:30.376 --> 23:31.876
Sorry.

23:31.878 --> 23:33.144
What'd I miss?

23:35.448 --> 23:37.114
[Spitz] Cole Gordon.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.216
A closed case.
I got pulled out of bed
for this.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.518
[Davis]
You know why you're here, Spitz.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.086
The MO is an exact match

23:42.088 --> 23:44.755
of a serial child abductor
you put away 15 years ago.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.958
I was on the phone
with your old partner
while you were all tucked up.

23:48.861 --> 23:51.128
They sent what they
still had on hand.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.330
Jesus Christ.
Put that shit away.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.567
Gordon's defense
attorney's trying to use it

23:56.569 --> 23:58.035
to build a case for a mistrial.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.437
They didn't waste any time.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.071
I'm sorry to disappoint
the dickhead lawyer,

24:01.073 --> 24:03.107
but Gordon was a
convicted pedophile

24:03.109 --> 24:05.309
with a trunk packed
full of those knives,

24:05.311 --> 24:07.878
not to mention clothes from
half a dozen of the victims
we found at his house.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.613
[Davis] Yeah, well,
it's probably a copycat.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.715
But we need to get
in front of this.

24:11.717 --> 24:14.718
I sent Larson to track down
the two boys that escaped,
Braun and Travers.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.954
[Spitz] <i> Oh, Jesus Christ.</i>

24:16.956 --> 24:18.889
[Davis] <i> Yeah, it's been</i>
<i> 15 years, but they might</i>
<i> remember details now</i>

24:18.891 --> 24:20.591
<i> that could help impede</i>
<i> Gordon's defense.</i>

24:20.593 --> 24:22.326
I wasn't wrong.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.662
I interviewed both those boys
extensively when it happened.

24:25.598 --> 24:28.265
There's no doubt.
No doubt.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.534
Then why'd you end up
with us, Ray?

24:33.973 --> 24:35.406
Get his address.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.787
[man] <i> But he went to prison.</i>
<i>He's locked away.</i>

24:49.789 --> 24:51.956
[Spitz] To the best of our
knowledge he is, Mr. Braun.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.592
But we'd like to talk
to your son, if that's possible.

24:55.328 --> 24:56.927
[Mr. Braun] He's out back.

25:10.309 --> 25:11.675
Tommy.

25:12.378 --> 25:13.511
Tommy?

25:14.547 --> 25:16.514
There's some nice men
here to see you.

25:16.516 --> 25:19.884
[breathing heavily]

25:19.886 --> 25:21.252
[Spitz] Tommy?

25:21.888 --> 25:23.254
Remember me?

25:27.693 --> 25:29.293
Officer Spitzky.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.163
It's been
a long time, Tommy,

25:33.165 --> 25:36.033
but I still have
that brontosaurus
you gave me.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.938
Tommy?

25:46.646 --> 25:49.146
[whimpering]

25:49.982 --> 25:52.716
No, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no!

25:53.386 --> 25:55.152
No! No! No!

25:55.154 --> 25:57.021
No! No!

25:57.023 --> 25:58.088
No!

25:58.090 --> 26:00.224
[gasping]

26:02.428 --> 26:03.994
[Spitz, on recording]
<i> Hey, Tommy.</i>

26:04.564 --> 26:06.363
<i> Tommy?</i>

26:06.365 --> 26:08.732
<i> Can you start</i>
<i> at the beginning for me?</i>

26:08.734 --> 26:11.068
<i> I need you to answer</i>
<i> my questions, okay?</i>

26:11.070 --> 26:12.736
<i> I know you're scared.</i>

26:12.738 --> 26:14.338
[young Tommy]
<i> There was a man.</i>

26:15.007 --> 26:16.307
[Spitz] <i> A man?</i>

26:16.943 --> 26:18.709
<i> Someone you knew?</i>

26:18.711 --> 26:21.612
[young Tommy]
<i>No, but he said he knew us.</i>

26:21.614 --> 26:23.781
[Spitz]
<i> Where did you see him?</i>

26:23.783 --> 26:26.283
[young Tommy]
<i>Watching us on the tracks.</i>

26:26.285 --> 26:29.086
[Spitz] <i> Did he do that</i>
<i> to your face, Tommy?</i>

26:29.088 --> 26:31.455
[young Tommy]
<i> I did it to myself.</i>

26:31.457 --> 26:34.425
<i> After the little house</i>
<i> in the trees.</i>

26:34.427 --> 26:36.226
[Spitz]
<i>Is that where he took you?</i>

26:36.228 --> 26:38.028
<i> Do you think you can</i>
<i> remember where it is?</i>

26:38.030 --> 26:40.097
[young Tommy]
<i> It's not there anymore.</i>

26:40.099 --> 26:43.233
<i> It's a magic house.</i>
<i> It disappears.</i>

26:43.235 --> 26:44.935
[Spitz]
<i> What does that mean?</i>

26:44.937 --> 26:48.172
[young Tommy] <i> It means...</i>
<i>you're never gonna find him.</i>

27:08.728 --> 27:10.494
[cell phone chimes]

27:18.638 --> 27:20.037
[knocking]

27:20.473 --> 27:21.572
Hey.

27:21.574 --> 27:23.574
What are you doing here?

27:23.576 --> 27:25.109
I took the bus out
this morning.

27:25.111 --> 27:26.777
I'm staying with
a college buddy
in Braxfield.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.178
Did you not get my messages?

27:28.180 --> 27:30.848
You cannot be here.
My son is here.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.017
Well, let's go somewhere.
Take the day off work.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.319
It's so good to see you.
No, no, no, no.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.087
Did you not get my texts?

27:39.325 --> 27:41.625
Did I freak you out
by what I said last time?
No.

27:41.627 --> 27:44.528
Because that was
a whole different--
Because I'm in love with you!

27:44.530 --> 27:45.896
I'm in love with you,
Jackie.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.166
I can't...

27:51.170 --> 27:53.070
I don't want to be with you.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.806
Jackie, listen.
I know you're scared.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.642
Todd, stop!
I'm scared too.
But what we have, you know--

27:58.644 --> 27:59.710
[shattering]
[groans]

27:59.712 --> 28:01.278
Ow!
Oh, my God.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.347
[Todd]
Ow. What the hell?

28:03.349 --> 28:04.982
Jesus.
Let me see.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.717
No, no,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.652
I'm fine.
I gotta sit down.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.287
No, no, come with me.
Come with me.

28:10.289 --> 28:13.023
Okay.
All right, honey.
I'm good.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.125
Oh, my God.

28:16.629 --> 28:18.228
What the fuck?

28:19.365 --> 28:21.565
[faucet running]

28:22.401 --> 28:24.101
[faucet stops]

28:27.707 --> 28:29.707
[Todd] Oh, Jesus.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.075
Jackie.
Careful.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.711
This reminds me of high school.
Remember?

28:33.713 --> 28:36.714
Sneaking into
your parents' basement
all those times.

28:36.716 --> 28:37.981
[Jackie] Here we go.

28:37.983 --> 28:39.750
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What? Okay.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.819
Ow. Whoa.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.887
Whoa.
This is like...

28:43.889 --> 28:45.189
Come here.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.557
[Todd] This kinda
hurts a little bit.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.926
Come here.
Oh, nice. [groans]

28:48.928 --> 28:51.061
This is great. Yeah.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.363
Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

28:53.365 --> 28:54.665
Be careful.

28:57.870 --> 29:01.972
[muffled voices, indistinct]

29:10.449 --> 29:11.782
Mom?

29:13.419 --> 29:17.521
Honey, you'd make
an amazing nurse.

29:17.523 --> 29:20.357
Oh, ow! Fuck.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.259
Oh.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.261
As soon as Connor
goes to school,

29:24.263 --> 29:26.363
I think I should take you
to the hospital.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.893
[phone ringing]
Yeah, that sounds great.

29:56.562 --> 29:57.961
You're calling me.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.064
Where's your phone?
What're you talking about?

30:01.066 --> 30:02.399
Where's your phone?

30:03.669 --> 30:05.903
[guitar playing on phone]
Hello?

30:07.573 --> 30:09.139
Hello?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.941
Did you leave
your phone somewhere?

30:10.943 --> 30:13.010
[phone chiming]
[chuckles] My phone.

30:14.413 --> 30:17.681
["A Man at the Frontier"

playing]

30:31.630 --> 30:32.996
[music stops]

30:36.368 --> 30:38.068
Did you turn this on?

30:39.171 --> 30:40.437
No.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.539
Were you just up on the roof?

30:42.541 --> 30:44.341
What?
No, what're you talking about?

30:44.343 --> 30:45.843
You said you were
taking me to school.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.244
I am.

30:49.481 --> 30:50.714
Is something wrong?

30:52.017 --> 30:54.585
Get in the car.
I'll be right there.

31:02.728 --> 31:05.729
Connor,
if you did something,
if you were upset--

31:05.731 --> 31:07.130
What're you talking about?

31:07.132 --> 31:08.465
You can tell me.
I won't be mad.

31:08.467 --> 31:09.733
I just want--
Mom!

31:09.735 --> 31:11.101
[tires screech]

31:16.141 --> 31:17.641
Sorry to bother you,
Mrs. Harper.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.810
No, Mrs. Whitter,
I'm so sorry for your son--

31:19.812 --> 31:22.846
Has he heard anything?
Your husband?

31:22.848 --> 31:24.882
I-I... I'm not sure.

31:24.884 --> 31:27.084
I know they're doing
everything they can.

31:28.754 --> 31:32.422
My son is
out there somewhere.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.092
They're gonna find him.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.795
Greg is going to find him.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.065
Yeah.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.569
Thanks.

32:11.530 --> 32:12.996

32:37.723 --> 32:39.022
[thuds]
[groans]

33:17.463 --> 33:18.695
[Greg]
You think he knew him?

33:19.498 --> 33:20.597
What?

33:20.599 --> 33:22.099
Justin Whitter.

33:23.268 --> 33:25.268
Chances are
he knew the kidnapper.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.604
Maybe.

33:30.275 --> 33:31.775
No, think about it.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.245
Kid's on his bike.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.415
Sees the perp.
They know each other.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.717
So the kids stops.

33:41.954 --> 33:43.887
He grabs him,

33:43.889 --> 33:46.623
drops one of the knives
to throw us off.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.293
Spitz?
Maybe.

33:53.732 --> 33:54.965
Or...

33:57.569 --> 33:59.436
He stops the kid.

34:19.892 --> 34:22.059
Sorry it took so long,
I didn't--

Help me.

34:54.126 --> 34:56.726
Jesus Christ, Jackie.
Walk me through what happened.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.428
Everything.
We were talking.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.063
[breath shudders]
[Greg] Just talking?

35:00.065 --> 35:03.567
Yes, we were talking
by the side of the house.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.435
I explained that we were over,

35:05.437 --> 35:08.472
and out of nowhere
it just fell.

35:09.641 --> 35:12.109
It was bleeding,
but it wasn't like that.

35:12.111 --> 35:14.578
Why didn't you
call an ambulance?
Is there anyone you can call?

35:14.580 --> 35:17.314
Why didn't you
call an ambulance?
It was Connor.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.449
[sobs]

35:19.451 --> 35:20.817
What?

35:21.487 --> 35:22.886
[sobbing]
He was upstairs.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.556
He's been so angry.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.091
So angry.

35:28.093 --> 35:29.993
So angry he tried
to kill someone.

35:29.995 --> 35:33.063
Maybe it was an accident?
Jesus Christ, Jackie.

35:33.065 --> 35:34.998
I don't know
what's happening--

35:35.000 --> 35:37.501
No, no! You don't get
to lose it right now!

35:38.070 --> 35:39.169
Listen to me.

35:40.172 --> 35:41.304
Do you know...

35:42.741 --> 35:44.574
what will happen to our son?

35:48.313 --> 35:50.213
I won't be able to protect him.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.230
Go change out of those clothes.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.282
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.897
[no audible dialogue]

41:43.368 --> 41:45.635
Drive straight to the hospital.
Don't stop for anything.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.637
I'll call you when
I'm on my way.

41:47.639 --> 41:49.873
I'll find him, Jackie!
I'm gonna find the son
of a bitch who did this.

41:49.875 --> 41:51.074
Drive.

41:54.312 --> 41:56.446
[tires squealing]

42:02.521 --> 42:05.154
Spitz. 911 dispatch
just got a call from someone

42:05.156 --> 42:06.723
claiming to have
seen our kidnapper.

42:07.325 --> 42:08.558
No shit. Where?

42:08.560 --> 42:10.360
They're tracking
GPS signal now.

42:10.362 --> 42:12.228
And Harper's not
answering his cell.

42:12.230 --> 42:13.696
I can pick him up.

43:14.960 --> 43:18.628
["A Man at the Frontier"
by Marc Morvan, Ben Jarry
playing]

43:56.601 --> 43:59.469

44:07.078 --> 44:08.244
[screaming]

44:52.524 --> 44:54.991
[girl, boy laughing]

44:54.993 --> 44:56.893
Did you get that on camera?

44:56.895 --> 44:59.896
[boy] Yeah.
I thought that wasn't gonna
happen. I was so close.

44:59.898 --> 45:00.997
Hell yeah!

45:00.999 --> 45:03.466
Holy shit.

45:03.468 --> 45:04.867
You see this view?

45:05.503 --> 45:07.470
[boy] Wow.
[girl] What?

45:08.640 --> 45:10.740
I don't think I've ever seen
a view this nice before.

45:10.742 --> 45:13.142
[boy] Nobody deserves this.
[laughing]

45:15.213 --> 45:18.214
[boy] That's a fridge?
What the hell?

45:20.552 --> 45:22.485
[girl]
Hey, don't break anything.

45:22.487 --> 45:24.287
[boy]
I wasn't planning on it.

45:25.990 --> 45:27.657
[girl] Oh, my God!

45:27.659 --> 45:28.925
They have "Battlestar"?

45:29.494 --> 45:31.394
Look at all that wine.

45:31.396 --> 45:32.995
Bet they're alcoholics.

45:33.698 --> 45:35.231
Jesus.

45:36.167 --> 45:38.101
They take so many pictures.

45:40.438 --> 45:41.971
Creepy mom.

45:43.942 --> 45:46.509
It just keeps going
and going.

45:47.212 --> 45:49.145
It has, like, actual wings.

45:54.586 --> 45:56.586
[boy]
They got you locked up.

46:02.761 --> 46:04.127
[girl] Alec!

46:04.129 --> 46:05.995
Hey, check it out.
I found our room!

46:13.104 --> 46:14.604
Guest room, baby.

46:17.976 --> 46:19.876
This is the life.

46:19.878 --> 46:21.377
[laughing]

46:21.379 --> 46:22.912
What the...

46:22.914 --> 46:26.215
These sheets are covered
in, like, a layer of dust.

46:26.217 --> 46:28.985
It's a fucking sandstorm,
Jesus.

46:28.987 --> 46:30.820
Do these people
not have friends?

46:30.822 --> 46:34.056
[Alec]
Didn't you say we had to sleep
somewhere out of sight?

46:34.058 --> 46:35.825
I did.

46:35.827 --> 46:38.060
Let me take you
to our sleeping quarters.

46:39.297 --> 46:40.830
And at night...

46:41.733 --> 46:44.901
we are going to sleep in here.

46:50.441 --> 46:52.175
Ta-da.

46:52.177 --> 46:54.577
[Alec] You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

46:54.579 --> 46:56.045
I'm not.

46:56.948 --> 46:58.014
[Alec sighs]

46:58.016 --> 46:59.215
[camera beeps]

47:00.318 --> 47:01.851
Okay.

47:04.789 --> 47:06.422
Okay.

47:06.424 --> 47:08.424
So,

47:08.426 --> 47:12.795
I should probably tell you
a little bit about
what we're doing. Um...

47:12.797 --> 47:16.999
So this is a documentary.
Yeah. Um...

47:17.001 --> 47:23.472
It's to give you all a look
at how a professional phrog
goes about phrogging.

47:23.474 --> 47:25.308
They call us phrogs
with a "P-H"

47:25.310 --> 47:28.444
because we hop
from pad to pad

47:28.446 --> 47:31.314
undetected by the people
who actually live in the house.

47:31.316 --> 47:34.851
Usually I try to stay in a place
for no longer than, like,
four or five days

47:34.853 --> 47:37.019
'cause it makes it harder
to be discovered.

47:37.021 --> 47:39.555
For the most part, I really try
to disrupt their lives
as little as possible.

47:39.557 --> 47:42.558
Oh, and it's a good thing that
these people have a guest room.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.660
That's what you wanna look for.

47:44.662 --> 47:48.731
A room that is rarely used
by the family
that you can make headquarters.

47:48.733 --> 47:50.299
As you can see,

47:50.301 --> 47:52.368
I'm eating some of their food.

47:52.370 --> 47:54.537
Um, this is allowed
because, you know,

47:54.539 --> 47:57.506
um... a girl's gotta eat.

47:57.508 --> 47:59.976
We just try not to take
too much of one thing.

47:59.978 --> 48:01.677
[shrieks]
[laughing]

48:01.679 --> 48:03.746
You asshole!
Alec!

48:05.049 --> 48:10.720
This disturbing creature
is my cameraman, Alec.
[laughing]

48:10.722 --> 48:12.755
I can't believe you brought
this creepy thing with you.

48:12.757 --> 48:14.323
What? It's fitting.
We're phrogs.

48:14.325 --> 48:16.025
It's a frog.
You're such a freak.

48:16.027 --> 48:19.562
He has never done this before,
so I'm showing him the ropes

48:19.564 --> 48:22.665
while he documents
with his nifty camera.

48:22.667 --> 48:24.066
Oh, I also let him
pick out this house.

48:24.068 --> 48:26.035
And I sure know how
to pick 'em, huh?

48:26.037 --> 48:27.670
So far, so good.

48:27.672 --> 48:29.338
This is
the best part of the day.

48:29.340 --> 48:31.274
We get to be loud,
and we have the house
to ourselves

48:31.276 --> 48:32.909
and we can
move about freely.

48:32.911 --> 48:34.377
But when they come home,

48:34.379 --> 48:36.779
we have to stick
to our hiding places

48:36.781 --> 48:37.947
and stay quiet.

48:37.949 --> 48:40.383
And that part's gonna suck.

48:40.385 --> 48:41.584
Yep.

48:41.586 --> 48:43.786
[camera beeps]

48:47.892 --> 48:49.125
[whispering] So...

48:50.395 --> 48:54.430
It is ten minutes
after 2:00 a.m.

48:55.533 --> 48:57.233
Alec and I fell asleep,

48:57.235 --> 49:01.370
and the family must've come home
while we were passed out.

49:03.808 --> 49:05.541
Alec, are you awake?

49:07.278 --> 49:10.212
Alec? Alec?

49:10.214 --> 49:12.014
[camera beeps]

49:19.490 --> 49:20.890
Alec?

49:21.759 --> 49:23.559
What the hell are you doing?

49:24.762 --> 49:26.362
[Alec] I was bored.

49:28.132 --> 49:30.499
[girl] You can't just go
outside whenever you want.

49:32.303 --> 49:33.970
[Alec] He just got home.

49:33.972 --> 49:35.371
[girl] Who?

49:36.674 --> 49:38.207
[Alec] The husband.

49:38.843 --> 49:40.176
[girl] Did he see you?

49:41.446 --> 49:43.512
[Alec] Yeah, I mean,
he saw me. He waved.

49:43.514 --> 49:45.815
[girl] Okay, very funny.
Come on. Get back inside.

49:58.496 --> 50:00.596
[camera beeps]

50:03.034 --> 50:04.934
[Alec] Sweet dreams.

50:09.874 --> 50:11.841
And here we go.

51:03.728 --> 51:05.728
[snores]

51:24.282 --> 51:26.315
[static crackles]

51:33.291 --> 51:35.925
[knife clinks]
[sizzling]

51:43.267 --> 51:44.800
[Jackie] We're gonna be late.

52:01.786 --> 52:03.919
[girl] Hey, are you insane?

52:03.921 --> 52:05.921
You trying to set off
a smoke alarm?

52:05.923 --> 52:08.591
Yes.
Stay away from the window.

52:08.593 --> 52:11.327
God, who knew this
phrogging thing would give you
such a stick up your ass?

52:11.329 --> 52:13.829
Shh! Hushed voices.

52:13.831 --> 52:15.331
Sorry.

52:20.505 --> 52:23.005
Dude, I don't think
you understand how dangerous
this is.

52:23.007 --> 52:26.408
We could go to jail.
We're breaking so many
laws just by being here.

52:26.410 --> 52:28.010
I do understand.

52:29.147 --> 52:31.247
But isn't that part of the fun,
almost getting caught?

52:31.249 --> 52:33.883
No, the fun is to not come
close to getting caught.

52:45.630 --> 52:46.829
Wanna play the word game?

52:50.101 --> 52:52.134
What is it with you
and that word game?

52:52.136 --> 52:53.836
Something to fucking do.

52:53.838 --> 52:56.705
Okay, you're the one who's been
hounding me to come along.

52:56.707 --> 52:58.541
I was perfectly happy
doing this alone.

53:00.678 --> 53:02.044
I know.

53:02.780 --> 53:04.813
I'm glad to.

53:04.815 --> 53:07.516
I just thought it
would be a little more...

53:08.786 --> 53:09.885
less shit.

53:09.887 --> 53:12.421
[giggling]

53:13.991 --> 53:16.625
It's better than...
[phone ringing]

53:16.627 --> 53:18.727
...subways and park benches.

53:18.729 --> 53:20.462
[phone ringing]

53:23.534 --> 53:24.633
Just about.

53:35.079 --> 53:36.478
Okay.

53:38.316 --> 53:40.616
I'm thinking of a...

53:41.552 --> 53:43.686
seven-letter word.

53:43.688 --> 53:45.221
It starts with a "B."

54:33.604 --> 54:35.537
[Greg] Jesus Christ, Connor.

54:35.539 --> 54:37.106
[Alec] Bastard.

54:37.108 --> 54:38.941
What?

54:38.943 --> 54:41.210
[Alec] Seven-letter word,
starts with "B."

55:11.575 --> 55:13.342
[girl]
Mission accomplished.

55:16.180 --> 55:18.213
There's so many places
to hide shit down there.

55:20.117 --> 55:22.184
If we need a quick escape,
that's our route.

55:25.623 --> 55:27.423
Check it out.

55:27.425 --> 55:30.192
[man on TV, indistinct]
How'd you do that?

55:30.194 --> 55:31.827
Downloaded an app.

55:31.829 --> 55:34.530
They keep their Wi-Fi password
next to the chore chart.

55:36.367 --> 55:38.434
You are such a freak.

55:38.436 --> 55:41.370
[man on TV continues,
indistinct]

55:42.973 --> 55:45.207
Wouldn't it be kinda funny
to mess with them?

55:46.477 --> 55:49.445
Take some random shit,
make them think
they're going crazy?

55:49.447 --> 55:50.713
No.

55:51.782 --> 55:53.048
It wouldn't.

55:53.050 --> 55:55.951
Stop touching stuff, okay?

55:58.489 --> 56:01.390
Can you believe
how loaded these people are?

56:01.392 --> 56:05.327
They have so much money,
and this is the shit
they decide to buy?

56:05.329 --> 56:07.396
The wife's some sort
of doctor, I think.

56:07.398 --> 56:08.964
It was on her mail.

56:08.966 --> 56:11.333
Dr. "Stepford Wife."
[doorbell rings]

56:11.335 --> 56:12.768
Shit.

56:14.305 --> 56:16.338
[repairman] Hello?

56:16.340 --> 56:18.974
Someone call
about a broken window?
Just a second!

56:18.976 --> 56:21.777
[Alec] Just let him in.
He doesn't know
you don't live here.

56:31.822 --> 56:34.423
[repairman] Hi. I got a call
about a broken window.

56:34.425 --> 56:36.592
[girl]
Yeah, that was my dad.

56:36.594 --> 56:37.926
Uh, it's right this way.

56:37.928 --> 56:40.562
[girl, repairman chattering]

[garage door opens]

57:27.978 --> 57:30.212
Alec! Come on!

57:30.214 --> 57:31.480
Now!

57:35.119 --> 57:37.486
I'm just a window repairman.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

57:37.488 --> 57:39.988
[Jackie] What're you doing here?
[repairman] Your husband
called about a broken window.

57:39.990 --> 57:41.623
Just finished
putting in a new one.

57:42.560 --> 57:44.326
No more going downstairs.

57:55.072 --> 57:57.406
Ha-ha. Level 59.

57:57.408 --> 57:58.941
Suck it, asshole.

57:58.943 --> 58:00.676
This is so messed up.

58:02.246 --> 58:04.246
Another kid got swiped.

58:05.249 --> 58:07.416
Here, in this town.

58:07.418 --> 58:10.986
Justin Whitter.
Ten years old.

58:12.189 --> 58:13.655
Oh, yeah, Justin.

58:14.792 --> 58:16.458
You know him?

58:16.460 --> 58:18.427
No, Mindy, I kinda stopped
hanging out with ten-year-olds

58:18.429 --> 58:19.595
when I was, like, ten.

58:19.597 --> 58:21.997
Okay, yeah.
Fucking hysterical.

Sucks for him.

58:33.544 --> 58:35.210
Yeah, it does.

58:37.314 --> 58:38.714
Here's your bottle.

58:40.150 --> 58:41.517
Okay.

58:41.519 --> 58:42.918
Thanks.

58:43.454 --> 58:45.454
Gotta stay hydrated.

1:02:41.291 --> 1:02:43.258

1:02:46.096 --> 1:02:47.462

1:02:47.931 --> 1:02:49.197
Alec.

1:02:50.300 --> 1:02:51.867

[Jackie] No, no, no,
Come with me. Come with me.

1:03:53.330 --> 1:03:56.198

Relax. It's a little bump.

1:03:56.200 --> 1:03:58.433
What is wrong with you?
Nothing is wrong with me.

1:03:58.435 --> 1:04:00.168

they're gonna call the cops?

1:04:00.170 --> 1:04:01.937

1:04:09.346 --> 1:04:12.647
Okay, I brought you here
because I trusted you.

1:04:12.649 --> 1:04:14.182

1:04:15.052 --> 1:04:16.685

Well, it would've been.

1:05:50.781 --> 1:05:53.248
We need to figure out a way
to get them out of the house

1:05:53.250 --> 1:05:56.217

or something.
