00:08.308 --> 00:11.477
<i>Wow, this sure is</i>
<i>a nice place here.</i>

00:11.512 --> 00:15.215
<i>Yes, sirree, I bet all</i>

00:15.248 --> 00:16.750
Bill, wake up.
It's on.

00:17.684 --> 00:18.685
Bill, get up.

00:19.886 --> 00:22.823
Sam, up and at 'em, Sam.
Let's go.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.424
Why is it on so late?

00:24.457 --> 00:26.159
'Cause at 8:00
you can't say,

00:26.192 --> 00:27.661
"Jane, you ignorant slut."

00:27.694 --> 00:29.563
I got your ice cream
right here.

00:29.596 --> 00:30.997
What do you say, fellas?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.465
Who wants
your ice cream, huh?

00:32.498 --> 00:35.035
Two down front, Dad.
Okey‐doke.

00:35.068 --> 00:36.603
Here you go.
Thank you.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.572
All right.

(IMITATING SAMMY DAVIS JR.)
Sammy, my boy, oh, Sammy,

00:40.541 --> 00:41.875
Did you want some ice cream?
Thanks.

00:41.908 --> 00:44.110
Bill? Bill?
Come on, Bill,

00:44.144 --> 00:47.180
We got ice cream
and Saturday Night live, Bill.

00:47.614 --> 00:48.615
Bill?

00:49.816 --> 00:52.218
<i>Hello, my name's</i>
<i>Paulie Herman.</i>

00:52.252 --> 00:54.120

<i>Piscopo cracks me up.</i>

00:59.159 --> 01:01.294
<i>Oh, I love Piscopo.</i>

01:01.327 --> 01:03.697
Dad, if Bill's not gonna eat
his ice cream, can I have it?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.632
Oh, Bill's gonna have
his ice cream,
because, Bill...

01:05.666 --> 01:07.801
Live from New York!
It's Saturday night!

01:11.572 --> 01:13.607
Why do you guys
always put stuff on me?

01:15.341 --> 01:17.410
I'm gonna get some pop.
That'll keep you guys up.

01:20.146 --> 01:21.848
Your dad's the coolest.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.083

02:36.089 --> 02:38.625
It <i>was</i> Chicago's

02:41.161 --> 02:43.163
Why do you even
know this song, man?

02:43.196 --> 02:45.031
NICK: 'Cause it's
a good song, man.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.667
Oh, my god,
you guys, you guys,

02:46.700 --> 02:50.403
check out the pizza‐face dork
with the trombone.

02:50.436 --> 02:52.706
Why doesn't he just
pop those things?

02:52.739 --> 02:55.208
I think if he did,
he'd die of blood loss.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.244
Oh, oh,
here we go.

02:58.278 --> 03:00.346
Look, look,
it's tuba girl.

03:01.548 --> 03:06.186
Hey! Hey, your tuba
is so big and sexy!

03:07.053 --> 03:10.190
It makes me hot
listening to it, baby!

03:10.223 --> 03:12.926
Play me some
Billy Joel! Yeah!

03:14.861 --> 03:17.197
Hey, at least she knows
how to play an instrument.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.899
That's not playing
an instrument.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.134
It's like blowing
into a toilet.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.903
It sounds better than
your singing.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.371
NICK: Ooh.
Oh, my.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.142
KEN: Lindsay,
here's an idea.

03:29.175 --> 03:30.476
How about you
break up our band

03:30.511 --> 03:32.312
so you can
make out with Nick?

03:32.345 --> 03:34.047
Oh, wait, you already
did that, that's right.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.582
NICK: Shut up, man!
Ow!

03:39.252 --> 03:41.822
Hey, I'm really, really sorry
he said that, you know?

03:42.989 --> 03:44.157
Ehh.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.627
No, really.
He didn't mean it,
you know?

03:48.028 --> 03:49.229
Whatever.
No big deal.

03:49.930 --> 03:50.931
Yeah?

03:51.532 --> 03:52.533
Yeah.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.935
Oh, so, Harold,

03:54.968 --> 03:59.105
Neal's dad is performing
emergency dental surgery
tonight.

03:59.139 --> 04:00.707
Well, good for him.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.843
Yeah, last week
he told me
about this lady

04:02.876 --> 04:05.145
who slipped on the ice
onto the sidewalk

04:05.178 --> 04:06.947
and cracked
her teeth.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.782
She was allergic
to anesthetic,

04:08.815 --> 04:11.518
so she had to be awake
for the whole thing.

04:13.286 --> 04:15.488
She had a tooth imbedded
in the roof of her mouth,

04:15.522 --> 04:18.458
and my dad had to suction out,
like, a gallon of blood.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.828
Well, what a charming story.

04:22.896 --> 04:23.797
Oh, so, Lindsay,

04:23.830 --> 04:25.866
have you seen
Ordinary People yet?

04:25.899 --> 04:27.333
No, I haven't seen it.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.569
Oh, well, you have to.

04:29.570 --> 04:30.971
I cried.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.640
And, um, I'm gonna
see it again.

04:34.307 --> 04:36.076
Cool. I'm sure
you and Sam

04:36.109 --> 04:37.377
will have a really
good time.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.879
No, I'm not
gonna see it.

04:38.912 --> 04:39.780
It's not funny.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.815
Neal, would you like
some more meatballs?

04:41.848 --> 04:42.716
Oh, no, thank you.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.284
My father says that
too much red meat

04:44.317 --> 04:45.619
can lead to
heart disease.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.921
Oh.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.191
Uh, Dad, can I have
an Atari for my birthday?

04:51.224 --> 04:52.492
An a‐what‐ee?
Atari.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.960
What the heck is that?

04:53.994 --> 04:56.530
That's one of those expensive
video games, isn't it?

04:56.563 --> 04:58.832
No, no,
it's not expensive.

04:58.865 --> 05:01.668
Yeah, well,
whatever it costs,
it's a waste of money.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.003
And time.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.839
You know,
the welfare rolls are
full of video game players.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.141
No, they're not.

05:08.174 --> 05:11.111
Well, they're gonna be.
Trust me.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.546
But Dr. Schweiber told Neal

05:12.579 --> 05:14.981
he was gonna get him
an Atari for his birthday.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.251
Oh, I asked for it.

05:18.284 --> 05:20.386
That doesn't mean
I'm gonna get it.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.487
LINDSAY:
I'm out of here.

05:21.522 --> 05:22.989
Whoa, wait a minute, there.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.157
Where are you going?

05:24.190 --> 05:25.792
I'm going to the library.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.361
I have to do
some research for
this history paper.

05:28.394 --> 05:29.963
It's on the Panama canal.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.933
Well, could you finish
your dinner first, please?

05:39.372 --> 05:40.406
See ya.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.042
Bye, Linds.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.615
Don't even try it.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.355
Hey, sorry I'm so late.

05:55.388 --> 05:56.557
Well, thanks to you

05:56.590 --> 05:59.059
we had to cancel our
dinner reservations.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.695
Can you ever
not be sarcastic?

06:01.728 --> 06:03.229
I'm sarcastic?

06:03.263 --> 06:05.331
DANIEL: All right,
Andopolis, come on.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.900
I'm getting some more fries.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.503
Hey.
Hey.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.583
I think I'm gonna go pee.

06:26.620 --> 06:30.456
So, Lindsay,
what is the deal
with you two?

06:30.490 --> 06:32.125
Do you still like Nick?

06:34.427 --> 06:37.497
No. I'm just trying
to be friends again.

06:37.531 --> 06:40.133
Well, forget it.
You'll never be friends.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.504
Maybe in, like, two years.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.271
But you're never really
gonna be friends again

06:45.305 --> 06:46.807
until Nick gets
another girlfriend.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.542
And then you're
just gonna want him back,

06:48.575 --> 06:50.376
and then this whole thing
is gonna start over again.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.045
I'm not gonna
want him back.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.248
All right. Yeah, sure.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.450
Look, just don't
lead him on, okay?

06:57.483 --> 06:59.285
'Cause he's obviously
still in love with you.

06:59.319 --> 07:00.787
No, he's not.

07:00.821 --> 07:03.256
Nick is the one who broke up
with me, remember?

07:03.289 --> 07:04.324
Oh, yeah, Lindsay,

07:04.357 --> 07:06.827
like that fooled anybody?
Come on.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.362
Look...

07:09.395 --> 07:12.533
You're just too nice,
you know?

07:12.566 --> 07:14.267
He's gonna get
the wrong idea.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.003
Well, what am I
supposed to be, mean?

07:17.037 --> 07:18.939
No, don't be mean.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.473
Just be a bitch.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.009
I don't know.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.077
Look,

07:24.110 --> 07:26.046
this is for his own good.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.213
Believe me, if he knew

07:27.247 --> 07:28.782
what you were doing,
he'd thank you.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.984
I can't help it,
man, I'm just...

07:31.017 --> 07:32.385
I'm so in love
with her.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.721
Right.
No kidding.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.958
Look, you gotta stop being
so nice to her, all right?

07:37.991 --> 07:39.660
That's how you blew it
the first time.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.227
Oh, like you're the expert,
or something?

07:41.261 --> 07:43.163
You and Kim
fight all the time.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.999
Yeah, but check
my new strategy.

07:46.032 --> 07:50.103
See, she can flap her lips
all she wants,

07:50.136 --> 07:51.838
I ain't fighting back.

07:51.872 --> 07:55.208
Sooner or later,
she runs out of gas.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.310
That is a brilliant plan.

07:57.343 --> 07:58.812
Only took you two years
to figure that out?

07:58.845 --> 08:00.647
It's like the tortoise
and the hare, all right?

08:00.681 --> 08:03.183
Little rabbit
gets tired,

08:03.216 --> 08:04.551
guess who wins?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.488
KEN: Are we still talking
about the same thing?

08:08.522 --> 08:11.725
Nick, you want to get
Lindsay back,

08:11.758 --> 08:14.294
you gotta give her
the cold shoulder.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.596
I don't...
I don't know, man.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.831
That doesn't seem right.

08:17.864 --> 08:19.633
Trust me.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.367
Don't call her house,

08:21.401 --> 08:23.136
don't write her notes,

08:23.169 --> 08:24.470
and don't sing to her.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.339
Jeez, man,
we don't want to be
friends with you

08:26.372 --> 08:28.174
after hearing
about that one.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.044
Yeah, Nick.
We need our space.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.682
Hey, Neal,
your mom's here.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.452
So, how was
your tennis game?

08:39.485 --> 08:40.587
Oh, god, don't ask.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.523
My serve was
in the crapper.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.190
I'm telling you,
I'm getting
too old for this.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.227
Every time
I swing that racket,
everything jiggles.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.563
I'd spend more time
on the court,

08:49.596 --> 08:51.131
but I've got
a full‐time job.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.699
Oh, really?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.234
Yeah, being Neal's chauffeur.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.368
Oh.

08:55.401 --> 08:56.570
The only things
I'm missing

08:56.603 --> 08:57.904
is the little hat
and the mini‐bar

08:57.938 --> 08:59.472
in the back
of the Buick.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.542
I know that feeling.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.578
Hello, baby angel.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.549
Baby angel.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.950
Shh, shh, shh.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.352
Thank you again
for letting Neal
stay for dinner.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.255
He is welcome
any time.

09:15.288 --> 09:18.692
All right, well, ciao.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.226
Bye.

09:25.498 --> 09:26.767
Ciao.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.138
Hey, Amy.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.206
Hey, Lindsay.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.407
Nice threads.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.909
(DEEP VOICE)
Nice voice.

09:36.610 --> 09:37.911
Hey, Sgt. Pepper,

09:37.944 --> 09:39.946
where's the rest of
the lonely hearts club band?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.782
Well, looks like
you ate 'em.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.017
KIM: Ohh.
NICK: Oh, nice.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.486
Yeah, Ken, when are
the twins due?

09:46.520 --> 09:47.754
That's not nice.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.690
Lindsay, is this bonehead
a friend of yours?

09:49.723 --> 09:51.357
No, he's just
a pain in my ass.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.425
(KIM LAUGHS)

09:52.458 --> 09:53.694
Oh, it's all right.

09:53.727 --> 09:54.961
See you later, Elvis.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.297
Good luck with
those muttonchops.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.932
(KIM LAUGHS)

10:09.710 --> 10:10.911
Look at this.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.620
I see you're admiring
our new microwaves.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.421
Oh, no,
we're just browsing,
thank you.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.589
Would you
like to see
a demonstration?

10:22.623 --> 10:24.725
Only take a minute.
Literally.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.292
I don't know.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.460
My husband says anything

10:27.493 --> 10:28.995
cooked that fast
can't be good for you.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.531
Well, you know what?
I'll bet he
wouldn't say that

10:30.564 --> 10:32.733
if he was the one
doing the cooking, right?

10:33.033 --> 10:34.100
Moo.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.235
Just kidding.

10:36.436 --> 10:39.172
Frozen solid.
Now watch this.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.978
Think of all the free time
you'll have to play tennis.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.447
Mom, I'm gonna
look at the Ataris, okay?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.015
Okay, sweetie.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.150
Wow.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.217
Your boy like hot dogs?

10:51.251 --> 10:52.285
Yeah.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.520
Thirty seconds.

10:53.554 --> 10:55.756
Oh, my gosh,
you're kidding me.

11:06.232 --> 11:07.734
Dr. Schweiber?

11:13.073 --> 11:16.510
Hey, Sam I am.
What are you
doing here?

11:16.543 --> 11:20.446
Um, looking at
microwaves
with my mom.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.048
Oh, yeah?

11:22.082 --> 11:23.650
(IMITATING WILLIAM SHATNER)
Well, Scottie,

11:23.684 --> 11:25.418
I hope you're not planning

11:25.451 --> 11:27.020
to cook a tribble, because

11:27.053 --> 11:29.322
I believe they're
better barbecued.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.526
I'm sorry,
where are my manners?

11:32.559 --> 11:33.760
Sam, this is, uh,

11:33.794 --> 11:35.395
an old high school
friend of mine.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.330
Uh, from high school.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.667
Anyway, kind of like
you and Neal are.
Are now,

11:40.701 --> 11:44.605
and, uh, carol, this is
a friend of my son's.

11:44.638 --> 11:46.807
Oh, very nice
to meet you, Sam.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.242
Yeah, we just
ran into each other,
isn't that funny?

11:49.275 --> 11:50.143
Mm‐hmm.

11:50.176 --> 11:52.012
Well, mildly funny.
It's fairly...

11:52.045 --> 11:53.514
Not really
funny at all.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.981
Can I have a word
with you in private?

11:55.015 --> 11:55.849
Yeah.

11:55.882 --> 11:59.152
Okay, um, listen, I, uh...

11:59.185 --> 12:00.153
I'd like it if you

12:00.186 --> 12:02.488
don't tell Neal that
you saw me here, okay?

12:02.523 --> 12:05.826
'Cause I'm getting him
an Atari, but it's a surprise.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.762
You can keep a secret for
good old Dr. S, can't you?

12:08.795 --> 12:09.996
All right,
gimme some.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.264
Don't leave me
hangin', now.

12:11.297 --> 12:12.533
All right.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.235
Anyway, carol, we'll have to
get caught up another time.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.903
Why don't you come over
and have dinner

12:16.937 --> 12:18.104
with me and my wife sometime?

12:18.138 --> 12:20.240
Oh, that
would be great, yeah.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.342
And it was very nice
meeting you, Sam.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.377
Goodbye, Dr. Schweiber.

12:28.549 --> 12:29.750
Oh, hey,
you know what?

12:29.783 --> 12:31.585
They're doing
Laser Floyd

12:31.618 --> 12:32.719
at Laser Dome
tomorrow night.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.087
Oh, yeah,
I heard that.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.989
It was in
all the newspapers.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.759
Oh, like you're
too good for
a laser show?

12:38.792 --> 12:41.027
Man, why do I need
to go to a laser show

12:41.061 --> 12:44.598
when I can make my own...
In my mind?

12:44.631 --> 12:46.733
You guys,
it's Floyd.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.102
"If you don't
eat your meat,

12:49.135 --> 12:52.305
"You can't have
any pudding!"

12:52.338 --> 12:54.107
It's Floyd!
Come on,

12:54.140 --> 12:55.776
They're not gonna do
Laser Floyd forever.

12:55.809 --> 12:58.211
All right! We'll go!
Shut up! Jesus!

12:58.244 --> 12:59.279
Go where?

12:59.312 --> 13:01.281
Oh, to, uh,
Laser Dome.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.850
You're taking me
to Laser Dome?

13:03.884 --> 13:05.586
Yeah. Be happy.

13:05.619 --> 13:08.622
Isn't Laser Dome
just a bunch of
squiggly lights on a ceiling?

13:08.655 --> 13:09.890
No, it's not
just a bunch

13:09.923 --> 13:11.725
of squiggly lights
on a ceiling.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.326
What is wrong
with you people?

13:13.359 --> 13:15.896
Laser Dome is
a metaphysical experience.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.130
Yeah, especially if

13:17.163 --> 13:19.800
you have your hand up
Wendy Franklin's shirt.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.268
So, do you want
to go or not?

13:22.302 --> 13:23.336
Yeah.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.974
Maybe.
I don't know.

13:30.243 --> 13:33.179
Is it just me or did it get
a little chilly in here?

13:33.213 --> 13:35.816
I'm gonna go get
something to eat.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.584
You guys want to
go to Stackie's?

13:37.618 --> 13:38.885
Mmm.
Yeah.

13:43.356 --> 13:47.360
Watch her run,
just like a little rabbit.

13:47.894 --> 13:50.163
I am the tortoise.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.439
Was I too mean?

13:59.472 --> 14:00.707
No. No, no,
no, no, no.

14:00.741 --> 14:02.108
I think that
was perfect.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.110
You know,
Nick really
got the message.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.314
Wait, so who's
Wendy Franklin?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.016
Oh, long story.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.118
Let's just say she's
a cheap little slut

14:12.152 --> 14:14.588
that Daniel made out with
while we were broken up.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.056
But it's over
with her, right?

14:16.089 --> 14:18.391
Lindsay, that's
not the point.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.961
He did it with her
at the Laser Dome.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.096
Now he wants
to go there with me?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.232
So, are you going?

14:26.266 --> 14:27.100
Well, yeah.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.469
I mean, what else
am I gonna do?

14:31.805 --> 14:33.940
Ugh.
This is disgusting.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.141
I can't eat this.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.910
So, I wake up
this morning,

14:36.943 --> 14:39.980
and guess what
is sitting on
the end of my bed?

14:40.681 --> 14:41.915
A turd?

14:42.716 --> 14:44.450
Yes, Bill, a turd.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.319
Eww, gross.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.722
An Atari video set.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.558
Is my dad
the coolest,
or what?

14:51.592 --> 14:53.159
So, uh, shall we say

14:53.193 --> 14:55.562
Asteroids,
my place, 3:30?

14:55.596 --> 14:58.198
Yeah, if that's
when you want to
get your butt kicked.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.202
Yeah, yeah,
3:30 sounds great.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.069
All right.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.404
If you'll excuse me,

15:04.437 --> 15:06.039
I'm off to get another
delicious serving

15:06.072 --> 15:09.042
of Ben Franklin beans.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.411
Remind me not to sit
next to him on the bus.

15:14.748 --> 15:15.949
What's with you?

15:17.083 --> 15:18.284
Okay, Bill,
I have a secret,

15:18.318 --> 15:19.553
but you can't
tell anyone.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.621
Do you swear?

15:20.654 --> 15:21.688
Okay.

15:21.722 --> 15:22.823
No, really, Bill.

15:22.856 --> 15:25.626
I said okay.

15:25.659 --> 15:29.295
Okay. Last night I saw
Dr. Schweiber at the mall.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.598
He said he was gonna
buy Neal the Atari.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.066
So?

15:33.099 --> 15:35.168
So, he was with
another woman.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.738
He said she was an old
friend from high school,

15:37.771 --> 15:39.573
But it looked weird.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.141
He was hugging her.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.909
Well, there's a lot of
different kinds of hugging.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.945
I mean,
was he patting her
on the back

15:44.978 --> 15:46.246
while he did it,
like guys do?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.081
Bill, I don't know.
It was a hug.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.816
Show me.
Do it to me.

15:49.850 --> 15:51.618
I'm not gonna hug you.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.219
Why?

15:53.253 --> 15:55.355
I'm quite secure
with my manliness.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.058
It's okay to hug
your friends, Sam.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.534
Okay, get off me.
I get it, I get it.

16:07.568 --> 16:09.736
Okay. See?

16:11.705 --> 16:12.906
Have you told Neal?

16:12.939 --> 16:14.808
No, and I'm not
going to.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.076
You have to.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.044
No, but he'll freak.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.814
I know, but there
are no secrets between us.

16:20.847 --> 16:22.048
That's our code, remember?

16:22.082 --> 16:23.684
That's easy
for you to say.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.385
You don't have
any secrets.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.153
Remember that time
in science class

16:27.187 --> 16:29.990
when I tried to sneak out
a fart but it came out a poop

16:30.023 --> 16:32.492
and then I had to flush
my undies down a toilet?

16:32.526 --> 16:35.295
Do you think I wanted
to tell you guys that?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.363
Bill, it's not
the same thing.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.933
It is. It's exactly
the same thing.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.102
We're not
telling him.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.270
(PLAYING <i>WHEN THE SAINTS</i>
<i>GO MARCHING IN</i>)

16:51.177 --> 16:54.314
Hey, what
are you doing?

16:54.347 --> 16:55.481
Nothin'.

16:56.617 --> 16:58.418
Who are you
lookin' at?

16:58.451 --> 16:59.820
Oh, I was just,

16:59.853 --> 17:02.322
You know, making fun
of the band geeks.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.524
Oh.

17:03.957 --> 17:05.291
By yourself?

17:05.325 --> 17:07.528
Let me see.
Let me see.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.204
Is that who
you're looking at?

17:19.039 --> 17:20.641
Tuba girl?

17:24.244 --> 17:26.412
You're in love
with tuba girl?

17:26.446 --> 17:28.481
Shut up, man.
Just forget it.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.983
Hey, hey, hey.

17:30.016 --> 17:32.285
Hey, I'm just excited.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.954
We've been waiting
since the third grade

17:33.987 --> 17:35.722
for you to like somebody.

17:35.756 --> 17:37.057
It's great.

17:38.992 --> 17:40.561
You think she
has a boyfriend?

17:40.594 --> 17:43.997
Not even an ex.
She's a tuba player.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.365
Screw you, Daniel.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.067
Hey, man,
I'm just joking.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.802
I'm joking.
Relax.

17:52.005 --> 17:53.039
She's cute.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.841
Yeah?

17:54.875 --> 17:56.543
She's friends
with Lindsay.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.178
You want me to talk
to Lindsay for you?

17:58.211 --> 18:01.381
Yes. That's exactly
what I want you to do.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.116
I'll do it.

18:03.149 --> 18:04.918
Hey, you know,

18:04.951 --> 18:06.953
if you tell
anyone about this,

18:06.987 --> 18:08.288
you're a dead man.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.322
Hey.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.560
See you later, stud.

18:24.505 --> 18:26.172
BILL: Damn. Damn,
you should hit
hyperspace.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.440
Hyperspace, hyperspace!

18:27.473 --> 18:29.175
Shut up, shut up,
I'm doing it!

18:30.644 --> 18:32.012
Argh!
Ohh.

18:32.045 --> 18:33.479
Maybe you shouldn't
have hit hyperspace.

18:33.514 --> 18:34.347
My turn.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.782
I got to go
to the bathroom.

18:37.183 --> 18:38.351
Oh, hey,
don't forget

18:38.384 --> 18:39.820
to lift the seat
this time

18:39.853 --> 18:41.254
or my mom
will kill you.

18:44.024 --> 18:46.893
You remember when we said we'd
tell each other everything?

18:46.927 --> 18:48.161
Yeah.

18:48.194 --> 18:49.429
Did you mean it?

18:49.462 --> 18:50.564
Of course.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.834
Even if it's something
really, really horrible?

18:53.867 --> 18:55.035
I mean,
it might not
be horrible,

18:55.068 --> 18:56.302
'cause it might
not be true.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.539
But if it is true,
it could be pretty horrible.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.707
Okay, Bill,
you're killing me.

19:00.741 --> 19:01.975
You gotta
tell me now.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.877
Okay, but you might not
want to know,

19:03.910 --> 19:05.646
'cause it's
pretty horrible.

19:05.679 --> 19:08.649
Bill, you didn't
tell him, did you?

19:08.682 --> 19:12.252
Wait a second,
Sam knows?
That's not fair.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.888
Okay, if you guys
both know,
I gotta know.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.391
Sam saw your dad

19:18.424 --> 19:20.260
hugging a lady
at the mall last night.

19:20.827 --> 19:21.828
What?

19:23.196 --> 19:24.464
Show him.

19:26.066 --> 19:27.333
All right.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.536
That's impossible.

19:29.570 --> 19:31.304
My dad was at
the office last night

19:31.337 --> 19:33.306
performing root canal surgery.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.275
So, that
wasn't my dad.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.578
It was your dad.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.112
I talked to him.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.614
You're lying.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.083
No, you're
just jealous,

19:43.116 --> 19:44.985
because my dad
is cooler than yours.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.052
I'm not jealous!

19:46.086 --> 19:47.320
Neal.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.823
We just thought
you should know,

19:49.856 --> 19:51.758
'cause we tell each other
everything, remember?

19:51.792 --> 19:52.926
Oh, shut up, Bill.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.327
You don't even
have a dad.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.063
I do, too!
I talked to him
three months ago.

19:59.700 --> 20:00.901
Hey, guys.

20:00.934 --> 20:02.135
How's the game?

20:02.168 --> 20:04.571
Do I get to fly one
of those rocket ships?

20:07.841 --> 20:08.875
I need to go home.

20:08.909 --> 20:10.577
I gotta go, too.

20:14.848 --> 20:15.882
Wait a second.

20:20.020 --> 20:23.189
Hey, guys,
I'm so lonely.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.324
Sam:
We have to go.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.692
Can't you
hang around?

20:25.726 --> 20:27.327
We could have,
like, a little
Asteroids contest,

20:27.360 --> 20:29.930
or, uh, Benny Hill.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.164
Always good for a...

20:31.197 --> 20:33.299
Hey.
Hey.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.568
Still leaking oil?

20:34.601 --> 20:36.102
Yes, it is,
as a matter of fact.

20:36.136 --> 20:38.071
Chinese or pizza?
I'm famished.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.707
Yes, sure.
You pick.

a boyfriend

20:56.422 --> 20:58.124
who humped
a slut like
Wendy Franklin

20:58.158 --> 20:59.192
in a certain place,

20:59.225 --> 21:00.594
let's just say
the Laser Dome.

21:00.627 --> 21:03.029
Would you
really want to
hang out there?

21:05.866 --> 21:07.300
She's got a point.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.970
Wouldn't you be
a little wigged out

21:10.003 --> 21:11.271
by the idea that
your boyfriend

21:11.304 --> 21:13.840
did things
with this slut

21:13.874 --> 21:15.341
in the very
same seat

21:15.375 --> 21:17.010
you could be
sitting in?

Can I go to
the bathroom?

21:33.760 --> 21:34.761
Hey.

21:37.097 --> 21:38.431
I regret it.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.702
You're so full
of crap, Daniel.

21:42.368 --> 21:44.004
What if I'm not?

21:46.006 --> 21:47.007
Well, are you?

21:47.908 --> 21:49.042
I don't think so.

21:57.818 --> 21:59.653
Yes, thank you so much.

All right, thanks.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.489
Sam, is that you?

22:03.524 --> 22:06.292
Hey, hold it
right there, mister.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.594
Now, you know
I don't mind

22:07.628 --> 22:09.530
if you don't come home
right away after school,

22:09.563 --> 22:10.731
but you have to call me

22:10.764 --> 22:12.465
and let me know
where you are.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.435
Sorry, I was
at Neal's house
playing the Atari.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.470
I guess we
lost track of time.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.039
They got him
that TV game?

22:19.072 --> 22:20.907
I thought they were
waiting for his birthday.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.310
Um, I have to
do my homework.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.913
Okay, dinner
will be ready
in about an hour.

22:26.947 --> 22:28.849
Oh, and you have to get
to bed early tonight.

22:28.882 --> 22:31.251
You have a dental appointment
at 7:00 tomorrow morning.

22:31.284 --> 22:32.753
What?

22:32.786 --> 22:34.420
Yeah, Dr. Schweiber
just called.

22:34.454 --> 22:35.556
He said he could
fit you in early

22:35.589 --> 22:37.357
for your six‐month check‐up.

23:28.474 --> 23:32.045
Sam, did you take
my Pink Floyd album?

23:32.779 --> 23:33.780
No.

What's the matter?

Why do people
have affairs?

23:42.889 --> 23:43.890
I don't know.

23:43.924 --> 23:46.426
Maybe they meet someone
that they like better.

23:46.459 --> 23:47.694
Well, do you think

23:47.728 --> 23:50.296
Dr. Schweiber would
have an affair?

23:50.330 --> 23:51.798
I never thought about it.

23:51.832 --> 23:55.168
Do you think Dad
would have an affair?

23:55.201 --> 23:56.503

Somebody call me?

24:54.628 --> 24:55.696
Do you know what?

24:55.729 --> 24:59.800
I think that you
and me need to talk.

25:01.134 --> 25:02.202
What about?

25:02.235 --> 25:03.904
Well, for starters,

25:03.937 --> 25:04.971
you were acting

25:05.005 --> 25:06.239
a little differently
when I saw you yesterday.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.808
Open, please.

25:07.841 --> 25:10.310
And, I tell you,
I was a little bit hurt.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.846
I, I just
didn't feel well.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.347
Well, you know
what I think?

25:14.380 --> 25:16.382
I think that you
may have thought

25:16.416 --> 25:17.551
you saw something

25:17.584 --> 25:19.753
that you didn't see
the other night.

25:21.154 --> 25:22.689
I didn't see anything.

25:23.156 --> 25:24.190
Spit.

25:27.160 --> 25:31.197
And, uh, you didn't
say anything to Neal

25:31.231 --> 25:36.002
or to anybody else about
meeting my friend, hmm?

25:36.036 --> 25:37.470
No.
Good.

25:37.504 --> 25:39.673
Some people
love nothing more

25:40.373 --> 25:42.709
than gossiping about...

25:45.546 --> 25:47.380
About seeing someone
spending time

25:47.413 --> 25:49.783
with another woman
who isn't their wife.

25:50.817 --> 25:53.053
Well, you can rest assured

25:53.086 --> 25:56.322
that nothing happened
between me and my friend.

25:57.357 --> 25:58.959
You do believe me,
don't you?

25:59.926 --> 26:01.294
I believe you.

26:01.327 --> 26:04.430
Hmm. You know,
when I was younger,

26:04.464 --> 26:05.666
I didn't have many dates.

26:05.699 --> 26:07.701
Met Mrs. Schweiber
back in college,

26:07.734 --> 26:09.903
and, you know,
she's a wonderful woman

26:09.936 --> 26:12.639
and she keeps
a beautiful home.

26:12.673 --> 26:13.740
It's just that,

26:13.774 --> 26:17.343
when you get older,
you get bored.

26:18.512 --> 26:19.613
You know?

26:19.646 --> 26:21.615
No, not really.

26:21.648 --> 26:24.317
It just...
It gets so hard, Sam.

26:24.350 --> 26:28.321
I feel that there's
something missing
in my life,

26:28.354 --> 26:31.457
and I think I deserve

26:31.491 --> 26:35.028
the chance to find out
what that something is.

26:36.429 --> 26:37.698
Don't you?

26:40.133 --> 26:41.535
I, I don't know.

26:41.568 --> 26:42.769
Yeah.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.239
Well, I promise you,

26:46.272 --> 26:49.643
things will be back
to normal pretty soon.

26:51.377 --> 26:52.879
All I need is time.

26:56.650 --> 26:58.451
In the meantime, um,

26:58.484 --> 27:02.255
I can count on
you and me keeping
this just between us?

27:03.356 --> 27:04.725
Sure.
Okay.

27:05.726 --> 27:07.761
Well, now
the bad news, bud.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.162
You got a cavity.

on the bus
this morning.

really bad,
you know?

27:18.304 --> 27:19.706
Yeah, so do I.

27:19.740 --> 27:21.174
I knew we shouldn't
have told him.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.208
Hey.

27:23.376 --> 27:24.711
Hey.

27:27.347 --> 27:29.716
So, are you
still mad at us?

27:30.951 --> 27:31.852
No.

27:31.885 --> 27:33.787
I'm actually glad
you guys told me.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.589
I was wrong
about your dad.

27:35.622 --> 27:36.923
He cleaned my teeth
this morning.

27:36.957 --> 27:38.859
I'm sure
nothing happened.

27:39.793 --> 27:41.361
Well, I don't know.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.564
After what
you guys said,

27:43.597 --> 27:45.231
I went through
some of his stuff...

27:47.233 --> 27:48.368
And I found this.

27:48.401 --> 27:50.504
Yeah? So what?

27:50.537 --> 27:53.139
This clicker isn't
for our garage door.

27:53.173 --> 27:55.208
I tested it.

27:55.241 --> 27:56.276
Why would
he have it?

27:56.309 --> 27:59.479
Well, maybe it belongs to
just a friend of his

27:59.513 --> 28:00.714
who left it there.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.649
Yeah,
a female friend.

28:02.683 --> 28:04.851
I saw this
Donahue once

28:04.885 --> 28:07.020
about husbands
that cheat.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.089
You can't do it
at home, right?

28:09.122 --> 28:11.457
So they all had
secret love nests.

28:13.026 --> 28:16.129
Maybe your dad has
a secret love nest.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.102
There's only one way
to find out.

28:35.148 --> 28:36.149
Hey, Ken.

28:37.283 --> 28:39.920
Oh, Lindsay.

28:39.953 --> 28:42.523
Look, I was talking
to Daniel,

28:42.556 --> 28:45.425
and he said that
I wanted to nail Amy,

28:45.458 --> 28:48.094
and you're here
to tell me that
it'll never happen.

28:48.128 --> 28:49.229
No.

28:49.262 --> 28:51.364
He didn't say
you wanted to nail her.

28:53.600 --> 28:54.768
He wanted me to ask her

28:54.801 --> 28:56.336
if she wanted to go
to Laser Dome tonight.

28:57.504 --> 28:58.539
Oh.

28:58.572 --> 28:59.840
So, do you want
me to do it?

28:59.873 --> 29:01.207
'Cause I want
to make sure

29:01.241 --> 29:03.376
that you want me
to do it
before I do it.

29:07.981 --> 29:09.382
I want you
to do it.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.184
Are you gonna
be nice to her?

29:11.217 --> 29:13.954
'Cause I'm not gonna do it
if you're gonna be a jerk.

29:13.987 --> 29:16.189
Of course I'll be
nice to her.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.324
I'll be an angel.

29:18.358 --> 29:19.926
Forget it.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.228
I'm serious.

29:24.330 --> 29:25.932
Okay.

29:25.966 --> 29:27.968
Do you think that
there's any chance

29:28.001 --> 29:30.003
that this may
actually happen?

29:32.172 --> 29:33.874
Oh, my god.

29:35.008 --> 29:36.543
What?

29:36.577 --> 29:39.279
You really like her,
don't you?

29:43.550 --> 29:45.451
I feel odd.

29:45.485 --> 29:47.988
So, I told my mom
I was eating
at your house,

29:48.021 --> 29:50.791
and Bill told his mom
he was eating at my house,

29:50.824 --> 29:53.226
so that should
give us some time.

29:53.259 --> 29:55.862
When are we
really gonna eat?
I'm hungry.

29:55.896 --> 29:58.098
Do you think
we're gonna
find this house?

29:58.131 --> 29:59.766
Well, we'll never know
if we don't try.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.868
Well, what are you
gonna do if we find her?

30:01.902 --> 30:03.303
I'm gonna say,
hey, lady,

30:03.336 --> 30:04.871
you want to mess with
the Schweiber family?

30:04.905 --> 30:06.607
Is that what you want?
Okay, boom!

to say hi.

That was
really great.

30:20.587 --> 30:22.556
Makes me wish
I played
an instrument.

30:22.589 --> 30:24.190
Yeah, you should
join band.

30:24.224 --> 30:26.993
Well, I'm kind of
taking a break
from activities.

30:27.027 --> 30:29.362
I quit the mathletes.
Twice.

30:29.395 --> 30:30.997
Yeah, Millie told me.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.700
So, anyway, um,

30:33.734 --> 30:35.468
I know this
is kind of
out of the blue,

30:35.501 --> 30:37.504
but I know
this guy, Ken.

30:37.538 --> 30:39.706
He's got
a crush on you.

30:39.740 --> 30:41.074
Do I know him?

30:41.107 --> 30:45.178
Well, you
kind of met him
the other night.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.447
Was he the guy
who was making
fun of me?

30:48.248 --> 30:50.183
Yeah, he's a total
wise‐ass,

30:50.216 --> 30:52.118
but that's how
he shows that
he likes you.

30:52.152 --> 30:55.321
It's just this weird
sense of humor.
I don't know.

30:57.390 --> 30:58.892
So, if you're not
doing anything,

30:58.925 --> 31:00.594
we were gonna go
to Laser Dome tonight.

31:00.627 --> 31:03.296
Why? Laser Dome sucks.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.532
Yeah, that's what
I thought you'd say.
