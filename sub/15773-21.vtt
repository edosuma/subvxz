were for the table!

07:10.120 --> 07:12.121
- Did you pay for those fries?

you pay for a meal,

I was on a roll.

08:45.026 --> 08:47.527
- Daffy, you've got to
apologize to Porky.

08:47.595 --> 08:48.437
- Why?

08:48.438 --> 08:50.931
Because he's done so much
for me over the years?

08:50.999 --> 08:52.835
Because he's shown
himself to be a

tremendous character

08:55.431 --> 08:56.710

about the game,

18:58.147 --> 18:59.176
You just talked to me.

18:59.215 --> 19:00.840
- Real mature, Daffy.

19:00.841 --> 19:01.840
- Daffy!

19:01.871 --> 19:04.637
- Stop copying me.
- Stop copying me!

19:04.684 --> 19:06.860
- Daffy, stop it!
- Daffy, stop it!

19:06.899 --> 19:09.032
- I'm serious!
- I'm serious!

19:09.170 --> 19:10.813
[Both sigh]

19:10.875 --> 19:12.489
- And it's halftime.

19:12.814 --> 19:14.414
Now let's go back
down on the field,

19:14.439 --> 19:16.735
As one lucky fan will get
a chance to kick

19:16.751 --> 19:19.629
A field goal for a million dollars.

19:23.402 --> 19:25.003
- Are you wearing cowboy boots?

19:25.025 --> 19:26.650
- Cowboy cleats!

19:26.651 --> 19:28.265
[Chuckles]

19:28.303 --> 19:29.687
Come on, feet!

19:29.688 --> 19:31.078
Lucky, lucky feet.

19:31.093 --> 19:32.655
- All right, just kick the ball

19:32.656 --> 19:34.210
so I can watch the second half.

19:49.544 --> 19:52.440
- [Screaming]

19:52.457 --> 19:53.988
[Screams continue]

19:53.998 --> 19:55.022
- Oh!

19:55.045 --> 19:57.741
You hate to see that happen.

19:57.772 --> 19:59.490
Gawww!

19:59.503 --> 20:01.438
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

20:01.505 --> 20:04.489
- Hey, he should have
worn more appropriate shoes.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.004
Can I get you anything else?

20:06.036 --> 20:07.816
- I never got my side of fries.

20:07.817 --> 20:09.042
- What side of fries?

20:09.073 --> 20:10.933
- The fries that come
with the meatball sub.

20:10.956 --> 20:12.815
- Fries don't come
with the meatball sub.

20:12.831 --> 20:14.097
- They did last time.

20:14.098 --> 20:14.948
- No, they didn't.

20:14.987 --> 20:17.323
I just gave them to you guys
compliments of the house.

20:17.339 --> 20:19.055
You know, for the table.

20:23.612 --> 20:25.347
- Well, that answers
that question.

20:25.348 --> 20:26.458
You gonna eat that?

20:28.443 --> 20:30.131
- Is that Señor Bugs?

20:30.162 --> 20:31.334
- Ahh!

20:31.402 --> 20:35.105
That hurts so bad!

20:35.172 --> 20:38.028
Mommy!

20:38.062 --> 20:41.064
- Well, someone's got
to kick it.

20:43.739 --> 20:45.807
[Kick ball]
[Crowd cheering]

20:50.121 --> 20:51.721
[Whistle blows]

20:52.366 --> 20:54.842
- Huh, I guess these feet
are lucky after all.

20:54.858 --> 20:57.027
[Crowd cheering]

21:03.537 --> 21:06.643
- I can't believe you gave the
million dollars to char-ity.

21:06.704 --> 21:08.071
- You mean "charity".

21:08.139 --> 21:09.043
- Oh.

21:09.044 --> 21:10.507
Is that how it's pronounced?

21:10.761 --> 21:12.596
- Hey, look over there.

21:12.619 --> 21:15.685
- Porky got a girlfriend?

21:15.686 --> 21:16.559
How?!

21:17.715 --> 21:19.686
[Giggles]

21:29.817 --> 21:31.919
- I was right about
the beard, huh?

21:31.981 --> 21:34.064
Maybe I should grow one.

21:35.305 --> 21:41.398
