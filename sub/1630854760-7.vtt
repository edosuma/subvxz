WEBVTT

00:02.077 --> 00:05.129
(sirens wailing in the distance)

00:07.824 --> 00:10.009
(exhales)

00:15.850 --> 00:18.075
(panting)

00:18.093 --> 00:20.561
(woman): Brenda?

00:23.024 --> 00:24.414
(knocking)

00:24.433 --> 00:26.233
It's time.

00:31.590 --> 00:32.939
You okay?
- Yeah.

00:33.016 --> 00:35.617
We don't want to keep
this judge waiting.

00:38.430 --> 00:42.115
- And what if we...
just get outta here?

00:42.192 --> 00:45.878
Went all Thelma and Louise
on their asses.

00:46.696 --> 00:48.605
I get that you're scared,

00:48.607 --> 00:51.675
but save the jokes for
when you're back on stage, okay?

01:00.895 --> 01:03.453
(crowd laughing)

01:03.472 --> 01:06.306
- Only men name things
after themselves.

01:06.458 --> 01:09.309
There are no woman junior's.
There are no woman the second.

01:09.461 --> 01:11.886
Men have to do it.
It's like a compulsion for us.

01:11.906 --> 01:16.408
Hi, I'm Zeke Thompson and meet
my lovely son, Zeke Thompson Jr.

01:16.485 --> 01:18.468
(crowd laughing)

01:18.470 --> 01:20.487
Ladies and gentlemen,
that's all I got.

01:20.639 --> 01:21.580
You're terrific.

01:21.657 --> 01:23.582
- Zeke Thompson.

01:23.659 --> 01:25.325
- Thank you.

01:26.111 --> 01:31.148
- In case you didn't know,
I'm Joyce Golden,
the owner of this dump.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.740
He started on this stage

01:32.835 --> 01:35.427
and now he's playing
packed arenas
around the country.

01:35.504 --> 01:38.430
Alright, go have a drink.
We'll be back in a few.

01:38.582 --> 01:40.490
- I don't know why you don't
just ask Zeke yourself.

01:40.492 --> 01:43.435
I hear he's throwing
an afterparty at his new place.

01:43.587 --> 01:46.830
- Yeah. You can show him
your new material.

01:46.849 --> 01:48.832
- Will you guys come with me?

01:48.834 --> 01:50.350
- No way.

01:50.502 --> 01:52.686
- Yeah, uh, I wasn't suggesting
that we go.

01:52.838 --> 01:55.763
- C'mon. Bren, we haven't heard
from Zeke since he blew up.

01:55.841 --> 01:57.599
And seeing all the things
that he has that I don't

01:57.618 --> 01:59.843
will send me off the deep end.
- Uh-huh.

01:59.845 --> 02:02.346
- We can stay for 15 minutes,
max.

02:02.364 --> 02:04.014
- Not me.
(Brenda scoffs)

02:04.016 --> 02:05.940
- What's up, boys.
- What's up, Fletch?

02:05.960 --> 02:09.777
- You again. Oh, hello.
Missed you.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.130
- Oh! Tease...

02:11.206 --> 02:13.298
- Now see, if I grabbed
a woman's ass like that...

02:13.375 --> 02:16.209
Come to this party with me
and you can grab my ass
all you want.

02:16.362 --> 02:17.803
- Okay.
- Go. I dare ya.

02:17.954 --> 02:19.863
- I can confirm
it's a great ass.

02:19.865 --> 02:21.381
- No, you missed your chance.

02:21.533 --> 02:24.201
I was on NyQuil
the entire college tour,
he didn't even try.

02:24.203 --> 02:25.144
Didn't even try.

02:25.295 --> 02:27.721
- True. True.
- Insulting.

02:28.298 --> 02:30.223
Please, Chadwick?

02:30.300 --> 02:32.225
Please, please.
- Uh-uh. No way.

02:32.378 --> 02:33.894
- Please. Fifteen minutes.

02:33.970 --> 02:36.071
- I said no, bish.

02:36.565 --> 02:38.991
(loud music)

02:44.390 --> 02:46.498
- Talk about a come up.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.727
- Yeah, now I gotta go home
and kill myself.

02:50.746 --> 02:52.171
What?

02:54.583 --> 02:56.675
It's still warm.

02:56.826 --> 02:58.594
I hate him.

02:59.905 --> 03:02.163
Hey, hey, check it out.
- What?

03:02.241 --> 03:03.907
- Chris Rock, ten o'clock.
- Where?

03:03.926 --> 03:06.092
There he is.
There's Zeke.

03:06.169 --> 03:07.835
Zeke!
- Zeke!

03:07.855 --> 03:09.079
- Zeke!

03:09.097 --> 03:11.081
What are you doing here?

03:11.099 --> 03:13.358
(laughing)
Come here.

03:13.435 --> 03:15.861
You gotta meet my friends.
Oh, my God.

03:16.012 --> 03:18.614
Ahhh!

03:19.608 --> 03:21.683
- My guy.
- Hey.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.944
You guys have to meet my Scott.

03:24.096 --> 03:25.520
This is the Scott that I have.

03:25.597 --> 03:28.189
He manages me and like...
half the people in this room.

03:28.267 --> 03:31.117
Scott, these are my friends.
I came up with these people.

03:31.270 --> 03:32.786
(Brenda): Yeah.

03:32.955 --> 03:36.289
- Oh, you guys
remember writing jokes,
listen at Tupac all night?

03:36.366 --> 03:38.366
- Eating Bottom Ramen.
- Ha ha!

03:38.385 --> 03:39.885
- Those were the days, man.

03:39.962 --> 03:42.721
- Those are still the days
for us, bro.

03:43.465 --> 03:45.206
- So...

03:45.226 --> 03:47.392
- Hey, will you snap us
really quick?

03:47.469 --> 03:48.802
- Yes. Photo.

03:48.954 --> 03:51.688
Family photo.
Come here.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.141
- So stupid.

03:55.218 --> 03:57.143
- Oh, that's terrible.

03:57.296 --> 03:59.479
- Are you gonna post it?

04:00.056 --> 04:01.314
Could you tag me?

04:01.467 --> 04:03.967
- Yo, so whatever happened
to grumpy ass Aaron?

04:03.986 --> 04:05.318
- Oh, you know, Aaron.

04:05.395 --> 04:06.970
Brenda wants to talk
to you about something.

04:06.989 --> 04:09.155
I was just gonna ask you
something if you had a second?

04:09.232 --> 04:10.991
(Scott): We need to say hi
to Sarah.

04:11.085 --> 04:14.494
- Uh, can you guys just hang out
for a little bit?

04:14.646 --> 04:16.255
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay, drink up!

04:16.331 --> 04:19.240
There's so many drinks and
they need to be drunk,
so please.

04:19.318 --> 04:21.167
- I'm sorry. I owe you.
- Yup.

04:21.244 --> 04:24.078
- Please, he's blind and he gets
nervous when I'm gone.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.448
<i> - I have to call the cops.</i>
- Don't call the cops.

04:26.450 --> 04:27.824
I'm on my way.

04:27.843 --> 04:32.062
My dog's barking like a maniac
again so I gotta go.

04:36.593 --> 04:38.318
Bren.

04:40.339 --> 04:41.738
- Fine.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.783
- Just one second.

04:44.934 --> 04:46.285
Uh, excuse me.

04:46.361 --> 04:47.677
Excuse me.

04:47.679 --> 04:49.179
Where do you guys think
you're goin'?

04:49.197 --> 04:50.438
- Gotta skate, bro.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.124
- Bren, didn't you wanna
talk to me?

04:52.200 --> 04:54.351
- Yeah, you're busy. It's fine.

04:54.353 --> 04:58.038
- No, Scott is like
prancing me around
like a little show pony.

04:58.114 --> 05:00.114
I am all yours now.

05:00.859 --> 05:04.194
- I could just take the train.
- My driver will take you home.

05:04.196 --> 05:06.454
- Okay, alright.
- Driver.

05:06.532 --> 05:10.600
Hey, if it couldn't be me,
I'm glad it's you.

05:11.961 --> 05:14.538
- God, I love you.
- I know.

05:14.631 --> 05:16.056
Love ya. See ya.

05:16.208 --> 05:19.709
- Um, I, I wanted
to show you my new material

05:19.711 --> 05:21.211
that I've been working on.

05:21.213 --> 05:25.065
Um, I sent a link to your
manager but I don't think he...

05:25.159 --> 05:26.491
- You have the link?

05:26.568 --> 05:30.070
- Yeah, but it's too loud
in here.

05:30.222 --> 05:31.888
- It's quiet upstairs.

05:31.890 --> 05:34.057
- You can't leave
your own party!

05:34.059 --> 05:37.394
- I can do whatever I want.

05:37.396 --> 05:39.296
C'mon.

05:56.098 --> 05:59.766
- I grew up in foster care,
I don't mean to brag.

05:59.843 --> 06:02.027
Um... and because of that,

06:02.178 --> 06:05.772
everyone always wants to know
if I want to meet my dad
and I don't.

06:05.924 --> 06:07.515
I... at all,

06:07.534 --> 06:10.369
but I what I do want to know on
some level that he would want me

06:10.445 --> 06:12.946
so what I wanna do is find out
his name,

06:13.040 --> 06:15.707
find him on a dating app,
match with him,

06:15.859 --> 06:18.192
DM him a naked photo of myself,

06:18.212 --> 06:22.196
and be like,
Do you wanna be my daddy?

06:22.198 --> 06:23.548
And he's gonna be like "Yeah".

06:23.700 --> 06:26.276
And I'm gonna be like,
"Good, 'cause you are".

06:26.294 --> 06:29.629
And then... and then
I will ghost him...

06:29.706 --> 06:31.390
- You know what?
That's pretty good.

06:31.466 --> 06:33.483
- ...because the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

06:33.485 --> 06:35.394
- Damn, this is really good.
- Thank you.

06:35.470 --> 06:37.712
- Yeah, Bren,
when did you write this?

06:37.789 --> 06:40.381
Ages... like, I've been
working on this for a while.

06:40.401 --> 06:43.309
I was just thinking like,
what if like I...

06:43.462 --> 06:46.613
what if I went on tour
with you?

06:48.316 --> 06:49.408
What?

06:49.559 --> 06:51.410
Is that
why you showed up tonight?

06:51.561 --> 06:54.413
You show up tonight so
you could pitch yourself to me?

06:54.489 --> 06:56.640
- Shut up.
No, I just...

06:56.642 --> 06:58.658
you know I, I,

06:58.735 --> 07:02.178
I know it took me a second
to, like, figure out my thing,

07:02.180 --> 07:05.090
but if I just had a, like,
a shot, you know,

07:05.167 --> 07:07.333
I would kill it.

07:07.410 --> 07:09.719
- Okay.

07:11.432 --> 07:12.822
- Okay, what?

07:12.824 --> 07:15.158
- Okay. You can host.

07:15.177 --> 07:16.993
- Are you serious?

07:17.012 --> 07:20.013
- Yeah, you can host and then,
after a couple of cities,
you can feature?

07:20.165 --> 07:21.756
- Oh my God, really?

07:21.833 --> 07:23.424
- Yeah, you're talented.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.502
You're great, you're funny.
- Thank you.

07:25.520 --> 07:29.030
Oh my... can I...
I have to go tell Chad.

07:32.010 --> 07:33.285
Excuse me?

07:33.436 --> 07:36.029
I think we should go back
to your fancy party.

07:36.181 --> 07:39.032
- I'm so tired of talking.

07:39.184 --> 07:44.521
- I know, I, listen...
I actually don't want to.

07:44.523 --> 07:46.206
I don't want to.

07:46.358 --> 07:48.041
- Why not? Why not?

07:48.193 --> 07:50.451
- You know what?
Hey, hey, hey. No.

07:50.529 --> 07:53.120
- It's not like
we haven't done this before.

07:53.198 --> 07:58.059
Like, you remember the
last time, it was super freaky.

07:59.646 --> 08:03.190
- Ow!
- Yeah, you remember last time?

08:04.726 --> 08:08.636
Just relax.
- Argh!

08:08.714 --> 08:10.489
Just, just...
(groaning)

08:10.640 --> 08:12.491
Relax.
(panting)

08:12.567 --> 08:15.160
(Brenda groaning)

08:18.724 --> 08:21.124
- I just want this to be over.

08:23.228 --> 08:26.153
What if we just...

08:26.231 --> 08:27.897
take the plea offer?

08:27.958 --> 08:32.052
- They only offered the plea
because they want you
to go away.

08:34.589 --> 08:36.681
I know it's hard...

08:37.592 --> 08:43.230
...but this all started
because Zeke Thompson raped you.

08:48.678 --> 08:51.696
(theme music)

09:07.530 --> 09:09.256
(beeping)

09:35.634 --> 09:37.659
(water pouring)

09:44.918 --> 09:47.294
(gulps loudly)

10:02.510 --> 10:05.228
(trembling breath)

10:08.257 --> 10:11.026
(panting, sniffling)

10:30.297 --> 10:33.089
(panting)

10:50.984 --> 10:52.375
- All I'm just sayin' is,

10:52.394 --> 10:55.044
Black Twitter could be
a little more inclusive, right?

10:55.063 --> 10:58.973
(crowd laughing)
- Hey, look who's too smancy
to return my calls!

10:58.992 --> 11:04.329
<i> I have to hear it from 10</i>
<i>other people that you're hosting</i>
<i> Zeke Thompson's tour.</i>

11:04.480 --> 11:06.647
- Joyce, uh...

11:07.000 --> 11:09.668
Zeke... he, uh...

11:11.563 --> 11:12.987
he, um...

11:13.064 --> 11:16.716
had sex with me
and I didn't want to.

11:17.994 --> 11:21.162
- Are you saying he...
- Yeah.

11:21.256 --> 11:24.849
- But how? I mean, there must've
been a million people around.

11:25.001 --> 11:26.092
- Oh, my God...

11:26.169 --> 11:28.061
- Joyce!
He raped me!

11:29.505 --> 11:30.914
<i> Joyce.</i>

11:30.916 --> 11:34.434
- I heard you,
I'm just trying to...

11:34.510 --> 11:35.919
<i> - To what?!</i>
- To process!

11:35.921 --> 11:38.604
<i> - I called you for help</i>
<i> and you're just not gonna.</i>

11:38.757 --> 11:40.757
<i> Oh my God, forget it.</i>
- Brenda, wait.

11:40.759 --> 11:43.609
<i> You and your damn temper,</i>

11:43.762 --> 11:45.620
will you just listen?

11:47.933 --> 11:51.859
I believe you
and I want to help you.

11:51.937 --> 11:56.214
<i> You want me to tell you</i>
<i> the truth or pull</i>
<i> from the MeToo handbook?</i>

11:56.365 --> 11:57.882
- Truth.

11:58.034 --> 12:00.868
- Okay, here it is.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.222
You've been working your ass off
for years

12:04.299 --> 12:07.133
and you finally hit pay dirt.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.619
<i> This is the big time, Brenda.</i>

12:09.637 --> 12:12.972
- How can I possible work
with him after this?

12:13.049 --> 12:15.808
- Can you imagine how many times
I had to lie down

12:15.902 --> 12:18.385
and take it from some dirt bag
I was workin' with?

12:18.405 --> 12:23.466
<i> You just wiped the stink off</i>
<i> and got on with your life.</i>

12:23.485 --> 12:26.745
- It makes me wanna kill God.

12:26.896 --> 12:28.413
- If He existed.

12:28.564 --> 12:31.249
Oh, Brenda,
what are we talkin' here?

12:31.326 --> 12:33.585
One, maybe two minutes of hell

12:33.661 --> 12:37.997
in exchange for the opportunity
of a lifetime?

12:38.149 --> 12:40.675
<i> Be smart, honey.</i>

12:41.653 --> 12:43.319
I care about you.

12:43.321 --> 12:46.247
Nobody is gonna tell you
the truth like me.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.600
I care about ya
and I believe in you.

12:48.676 --> 12:51.344
That's why I stuck with you
all these years.

12:51.420 --> 12:53.521
- I know.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.108
- I want you to go to bed

12:57.260 --> 12:59.694
and call me in the morning.

13:00.672 --> 13:02.596
<i> Brenda, promise,</i>

13:02.616 --> 13:07.702
<i> you won't do anything</i>
<i>without calling me first, okay?</i>

13:09.364 --> 13:10.955
- Okay.

13:11.107 --> 13:13.866
<i> - Okay. Bye.</i>

13:13.943 --> 13:16.711
(nervous breathing)

13:24.863 --> 13:28.181
(horn tooting, sirens wailing)

13:30.051 --> 13:32.477
(phone buzzing)

13:59.731 --> 14:02.966
(muffled soundscape)

14:18.099 --> 14:20.650
(trembling breath)

14:23.088 --> 14:26.513
(phone keys clicking)

14:26.533 --> 14:29.117
(line ringing)

14:31.096 --> 14:34.455
<i> - Hello, New Hope Center,</i>
<i> Queens. Can I help you?</i>

14:36.935 --> 14:41.045
- I've been assaulted
and I need to know what to do.

14:41.122 --> 14:43.364
- This is my hand, okay?

14:43.383 --> 14:46.593
I'm inserting the speculum.

14:51.449 --> 14:55.226
- Almost there, Ms. Kramer,
hang in there.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.397
(sniffling and sobbing)

14:59.474 --> 15:02.025
(door opening)

15:17.733 --> 15:19.659
- I called Joyce.

15:19.811 --> 15:22.712
She told me to let it go.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.665
Take the tour.

15:25.741 --> 15:28.651
- Joyce is about Joyce.

15:28.653 --> 15:30.244
- Zeke's her golden goose.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.822
- That bitch is savage.

15:32.824 --> 15:36.601
You know I heard she, uh...
reached out to Cosby.

15:38.754 --> 15:41.022
Too soon?

15:43.001 --> 15:46.852
- Do you think
that he lured them in

15:46.929 --> 15:49.855
with his Fat Albert impression?

15:49.932 --> 15:52.099
(laughing)

15:52.118 --> 15:56.788
(weird voice): Hey, hey, hey,
gimme that boo...

15:56.864 --> 15:59.624
(laughing)

16:05.356 --> 16:09.467
You're gonna get through this,
you hear me?
- I know. I know.

16:09.618 --> 16:12.512
- You're a damn warrior.

16:17.885 --> 16:19.385
- Chad?

16:19.462 --> 16:23.982
- Hey, your coffee's
just horrible.

16:25.301 --> 16:28.695
- So is my life.
- Ha-ha!

16:33.384 --> 16:35.284
- What?

16:37.388 --> 16:39.247
- Here.

16:45.396 --> 16:47.171
You reported it yesterday.

16:47.323 --> 16:49.081
- At least
they didn't print my name.

16:49.234 --> 16:52.260
- No, but...

16:53.680 --> 16:55.680
your name's out there.

17:02.004 --> 17:04.272
- Lying... lying whore?

17:06.008 --> 17:11.178
Ain't no one gonna
beat that busted...

17:11.197 --> 17:15.107
<i> - I hit it. Okay, my boy hit</i>
<i> it, the neighborhood dog.</i>

17:15.260 --> 17:16.592
<i> She's thirsty.</i>
<i> (laughs)</i>

17:16.594 --> 17:18.202
<i> She's thirsty.</i>
- Okay. Those are ...

17:18.429 --> 17:21.039
Hey, hey. Look at me. Look
at me. Those are just trolls.

17:21.115 --> 17:23.499
(phone buzzing)

17:25.861 --> 17:27.670
Don't answer it.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.624
- What do I do?
- I have no idea

17:31.776 --> 17:34.677
but I'm here, okay? Okay?

17:50.978 --> 17:54.155
(buzzing, phone
clacking on the table)

17:56.058 --> 17:57.466
- I'm calling the cops.

17:57.468 --> 17:59.410
- Bren, please,
don't hang up, okay?

17:59.487 --> 18:01.470
Just hear me out.

18:01.489 --> 18:03.322
Listen, um...

18:03.474 --> 18:06.475
if you go through with this,

18:06.477 --> 18:09.587
you will ruin both of our lives.

18:12.333 --> 18:16.502
Bren, um, look, I'm sorry, okay?

18:16.654 --> 18:19.597
I'm sorry if I misread
some signals.

18:19.674 --> 18:21.173
- Misread the signals?

18:21.250 --> 18:24.343
What about any of that made
you think I wanted to have sex?

18:24.495 --> 18:26.512
- What are you,
what are you talking about?

18:26.664 --> 18:31.758
Brenda, we have had sex on your
floor, twice, and it was rough.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.260
That's how we liked it.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.780
- I said I didn't want to.
<i> - Why didn't you fight back?</i>

18:35.931 --> 18:37.022
- I did.

18:37.433 --> 18:39.525
- Why didn't you just leave?
- I tried. You held me down.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.786
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:41.937 --> 18:43.121
Relax.

18:43.272 --> 18:45.123
- You think 'cause
you're famous now,

18:45.274 --> 18:47.583
you can just treat people
like this?

18:48.686 --> 18:50.777
I'm a person.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.446
Zeke, I'm...

18:52.523 --> 18:54.690
I may be crap
but I am a person.

18:54.783 --> 18:57.284
- You're gonna go through
with this? Is that
what you're saying?

18:57.286 --> 18:59.362
- You're just gonna do it again.

18:59.364 --> 19:00.972
- Great.

19:01.048 --> 19:03.975
Say whatever you want, Bren,

19:04.126 --> 19:06.561
everybody knows you're crazy.

19:13.544 --> 19:15.027
(phone beeping)

19:17.973 --> 19:19.991
(Brenda sighs)

19:28.409 --> 19:29.650
- Ms. Kramer.

19:29.727 --> 19:32.061
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm ADA Lavigne.

19:32.063 --> 19:34.172
I'll be in charge of your case.
- Thank you.

19:34.323 --> 19:36.674
- We're just in here.

19:44.333 --> 19:47.243
Okay, just a few more questions
about that night.

19:47.261 --> 19:50.479
- Can I leave out the part
where I was raped?
(chuckles)

19:52.099 --> 19:53.749
It was a joke.

19:53.768 --> 19:55.509
- Right.

19:55.678 --> 20:00.347
So in your statement,
you mention that you entered
the room willingly.

20:00.425 --> 20:02.015
Why?

20:02.035 --> 20:07.263
- Zeke was about to go
on the road, um, for a tour,

20:07.281 --> 20:10.541
and I wanted to pitch myself
to open for him.

20:10.693 --> 20:13.936
- It's not out of the ordinary
to 'pitch yourself'
in a bedroom?

20:14.622 --> 20:17.364
- Well, it was just really loud
in there and I...

20:17.442 --> 20:19.458
I had the link on my phone
and I just,

20:19.535 --> 20:21.702
I didn't want to play it
in front of everyone

20:21.779 --> 20:25.264
so we just, like, went in...
like, a room.

20:28.286 --> 20:30.210
- Was Zeke sober?

20:30.230 --> 20:33.213
- Didn't have
my breathalyzer on me.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.881
- What about you?

20:35.460 --> 20:38.218
- What about me?
- Were you sober?

20:38.887 --> 20:42.314
- Sober enough
to know I was...

20:42.467 --> 20:44.158
being raped.

20:45.728 --> 20:47.470
- You should commend yourself.

20:47.472 --> 20:51.082
Most victims of sexual assaults
never even report it.

20:52.585 --> 20:56.504
- I can't let him ruin
someone else's life.

20:57.665 --> 20:59.740
Are there more questions or...

20:59.834 --> 21:02.093
- Uh, no, I think
we're good for now.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.470
- Thank you.
- Okay.

21:05.673 --> 21:08.324
Uh, just one
more thing actually.

21:08.326 --> 21:09.341
Um...

21:09.418 --> 21:12.103
you waited a day
to report this, why?

21:13.922 --> 21:15.940
- Because...

21:16.091 --> 21:18.517
this is a nightmare.

21:18.594 --> 21:21.670
- Is there something else
I should know?

21:21.689 --> 21:25.649
- Anything about your
relationship with Mr. Thompson?

21:25.726 --> 21:27.526
- No.

21:27.678 --> 21:30.437
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

21:30.456 --> 21:34.199
- Please tell the court
in what context
you met the defendant.

21:34.276 --> 21:38.537
- I was the ADA in charge
of investigating
Ms. Kramer's alleged rape.

21:38.689 --> 21:40.464
- And as your investigation
progressed,

21:40.541 --> 21:43.450
did Brenda Kramer's
behavior change?

21:44.211 --> 21:48.288
- She got angrier,
obsessive and disturbed.

21:48.366 --> 21:50.975
- Can we refrain
from pathologizing my client?

21:50.977 --> 21:53.869
- Jury will disregard
Mr. Lavigne's last statement.

21:53.888 --> 21:57.631
- Mr. Lavigne, it's too early
in the morning for this.

21:57.708 --> 21:59.817
- I'll rephrase, Your Honor.

21:59.968 --> 22:04.280
Mr. Lavigne,
how would you describe
Ms. Kramer's state of mind?

22:05.216 --> 22:08.034
- She was upset, understandably.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.163
- Be calm.

22:12.314 --> 22:14.390
- Calm.
Ten years.

22:14.392 --> 22:15.891
Fired me over text.
Be calm?

22:15.893 --> 22:17.168
- Hold, hold up, Brenda.
Hold up.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.578
- What do you mean hold up?
I'm just gonna talk to her.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.172
- She doesn't wanna talk to you.
- Oh, my God.

22:21.490 --> 22:24.008
- Tell her to get
her shriveled ass out here
before I make a scene.

22:24.085 --> 22:25.343
- Oh, okay.
That's calm?

22:25.570 --> 22:27.736
- What are you doing?
- Y'all trying to get me fired.

22:27.755 --> 22:31.182
- Chad, you got a set in 15.
And you don't work here anymore.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.999
- I thought you cared about me.

22:33.077 --> 22:35.686
- I told you to call me
before you did anything.

22:35.838 --> 22:37.671
- So you
could talk me out of it?

22:37.690 --> 22:39.415
- I am done trying, Brenda.

22:39.433 --> 22:41.525
You had a chance
and you blew it.

22:41.677 --> 22:45.345
- You only fired me
'cause Zeke is your meal ticket.

22:45.365 --> 22:48.757
I fired you because you can't
get out of your own way.

22:48.776 --> 22:52.203
You'd never miss an opportunity
to miss an opportunity.

22:52.279 --> 22:53.929
Look, just take this check

22:54.022 --> 22:57.583
and get out of my club
before I call the cops.

22:58.603 --> 23:00.378
- Oh, my God.

23:00.454 --> 23:02.529
You know I can't get a job
anywhere.

23:02.623 --> 23:05.107
Where am I gonna go?
No one's gonna hire me.

23:05.109 --> 23:07.385
- Brenda, it's over.

23:07.461 --> 23:09.278
I'm done.

23:09.296 --> 23:12.014
One minute
or you lose your spot.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.636
- I'm quitting.
- Don't be stupid.

23:17.788 --> 23:20.564
- We can form a buddy act,
we could take it on the road.

23:20.641 --> 23:23.142
- Go. Get on stage.

23:23.218 --> 23:26.570
Go.
- I'll come by after.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.241
- I saw that.

23:30.317 --> 23:32.225
She's wrong.
- Oh...

23:32.278 --> 23:33.986
That's show business.

23:34.062 --> 23:38.040
- How disappointing
because I came to see you.

23:40.235 --> 23:42.253
- You look familiar.
Do I know you?

23:42.404 --> 23:45.481
- RDG's Cape, from online.

23:45.499 --> 23:47.666
- Oh, my God.

23:48.410 --> 23:51.153
RBG's Cape.
You know, you are funny.

23:51.155 --> 23:54.339
- Thanks, that's a high
compliment coming from you.

23:54.492 --> 23:56.008
I'm Tess.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.918
- Nice to meet you.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.419
- Nice to meet you.

23:59.439 --> 24:02.106
- Well, I'm sorry
I'm not going on tonight.

24:02.257 --> 24:05.517
- And I am no longer supporting
this establishment.

24:05.594 --> 24:08.094
There's a Thai restaurant
a few blocks down.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.780
I'm buying.

24:09.932 --> 24:12.324
- I'm starving.
(chuckles)

24:14.787 --> 24:18.622
- And they always make the woman
out to be the crazy one.

24:18.774 --> 24:21.684
Do you remember that movie,
uh, Fatal Attraction?
- Yes!

24:21.702 --> 24:25.278
- When Glenn Close's character,
really successful, independent,

24:25.356 --> 24:28.132
goes crazy after sleeping
with a guy one time?!

24:28.283 --> 24:31.135
Loses her mind.
(laughing)

24:32.029 --> 24:33.378
- Um!

24:33.531 --> 24:36.548
And I personally feel like
Michael Douglas sucked at sex.

24:36.701 --> 24:40.719
Oh, Chadwick!

24:40.796 --> 24:42.963
- Whoa.
Okay, you're jolly.

24:43.040 --> 24:46.391
- Tess, this is
my best friend, his name's Chad.

24:47.044 --> 24:49.803
- Chad, nice to meet you.
I'm Tess.
- Nice to meet ya.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.213
- Have a seat.

24:51.232 --> 24:53.473
I'll get you some wine.

24:54.494 --> 24:58.329
How'd it go tonight?
- Yeah, it was uh, dead.

24:59.223 --> 25:01.406
So Tess, uh, what do you do?

25:01.559 --> 25:04.168
- I'm an associate
at a law firm.

25:04.245 --> 25:06.729
Contracts. Boring stuff.

25:06.822 --> 25:09.298
(loud clanging)
Are you okay?

25:09.917 --> 25:11.583
(Brenda groans)

25:11.660 --> 25:13.085
- Oh... lemme...

25:13.237 --> 25:15.587
- Okay, let's uh,
let's get you to bed.

25:15.664 --> 25:16.847
- No.
- Yeah. Come on.

25:16.999 --> 25:18.257
- You're okay. Okay.

25:18.333 --> 25:19.833
- You know, just...
- Get to bed.

25:20.502 --> 25:22.745
- You know what?
I'll hold onto this for you.

25:22.763 --> 25:24.913
Okay?
- Okay, you can have it.

25:24.932 --> 25:26.524
You are just so soft.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.609
- I'll clean up.

25:49.123 --> 25:52.883
- She passed out as soon
as her head hit the pillow.

25:53.611 --> 25:56.512
It's gonna take her some time,
Chad.

25:57.873 --> 25:59.056
- I'm sorry.

25:59.133 --> 26:01.725
You been here like five minutes,

26:01.727 --> 26:04.119
how do you know what she needs?

26:05.398 --> 26:08.807
- Did you know that
one in three women are subjected
to sexual violence?

26:09.476 --> 26:12.403
It's a club no one wants
to belong to,

26:12.479 --> 26:14.387
but it has
the largest membership.

26:14.407 --> 26:17.557
It's gonna be rough for her
for a while.

26:17.635 --> 26:21.453
So like I said,
give her some time.

26:33.651 --> 26:36.668
<i> I grew up in foster care,</i>
<i> I don't mean to brag.</i>

26:36.821 --> 26:38.987
<i> Um, and because of that,</i>

26:39.006 --> 26:42.749
<i> everyone always wants to know</i>
<i> if I want to meet my dad</i>
<i> and I don't.</i>

26:42.768 --> 26:44.435
<i> I, at all,</i>

26:44.511 --> 26:47.512
<i> but what I do want to know on</i>
<i>some level that he would want me</i>

26:47.665 --> 26:50.165
<i> so what I wanna do is</i>
<i> find out his name,</i>

26:50.167 --> 26:52.684
<i> find him on a dating app,</i>
<i> match with him,</i>

26:52.761 --> 26:55.279
<i>DM him a naked photo of myself,</i>

26:55.430 --> 26:59.116
<i> and be like,</i>
<i> Do you wanna be my daddy?</i>

26:59.193 --> 27:00.525
<i>And he's gonna be like, "Yeah".</i>

27:00.620 --> 27:02.861
<i> And I'm gonna be like</i>
<i> "Good, 'cause you are."</i>

27:03.013 --> 27:07.532
<i> And then... and then,</i>
<i> I will ghost him</i>

27:07.609 --> 27:10.753
<i> because the apple doesn't fall</i>
<i> far from the tree.</i>

27:11.947 --> 27:13.505
(sighs)

27:14.375 --> 27:16.133
- Ms. Kramer's sense of humor,

27:16.284 --> 27:19.619
would you describe her comedy
as reflecting her off-stage
personality?

27:19.697 --> 27:21.363
- Oh yeah.
Definitely.

27:21.382 --> 27:24.124
- Would you go so far
as to describe her behavior
as promiscuous?

27:24.201 --> 27:28.537
- Well, if sleeping
with everyone at the club is
promiscuous, then yeah.

27:28.555 --> 27:30.189
(chuckles)

27:31.892 --> 27:33.466
- So just to confirm,

27:33.653 --> 27:37.396
you told Brenda Kramer
she could open for you
before the alleged rape?

27:37.548 --> 27:40.473
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- So there was no quid pro quo,

27:40.493 --> 27:44.144
no coercion of sexual favors
in exchange for a job offer.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.497
- Absolutely not.

27:46.573 --> 27:48.573
- Do you know why she would
invent a story that she knew

27:48.726 --> 27:51.502
would cost her the biggest
professional opportunity
of her career?

27:51.653 --> 27:55.731
- Brenda is the poster-child
for self-sabotage,

27:55.749 --> 27:57.900
she always has been.

27:58.493 --> 28:00.736
- Alright, let's get back
to that night.

28:00.754 --> 28:04.515
Um, so she played you
her material, you hired her...

28:04.666 --> 28:08.352
- We were laughing, you know,
we're having a good time

28:08.429 --> 28:11.413
and uh, then we started kissing,

28:11.415 --> 28:14.249
and you know,
one thing leads to another.

28:14.251 --> 28:19.087
- And no part of you ever
thought that Brenda Kramer
did not want to have sex?

28:19.089 --> 28:21.699
- We both wanted it.

28:23.093 --> 28:26.662
I mean, it's not like
we hadn't done it before.

28:29.099 --> 28:31.283
- You're saying that prior
to that night,

28:31.377 --> 28:34.044
you and Ms. Kramer...?
- Had sex?

28:34.121 --> 28:37.131
Yeah. Twice.

28:39.793 --> 28:41.610
- Can you repeat the question?

28:41.612 --> 28:45.113
- Do you have any knowledge
of previous sexual relations

28:45.132 --> 28:48.016
between Brenda Kramer
and Zeke Thompson?

28:49.729 --> 28:51.377
(sighs)

28:51.455 --> 28:54.214
You can answer the question here
or in court.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.625
- Yes, they had sex before.

28:56.627 --> 28:58.402
- And who told you?

28:58.553 --> 29:00.612
Brenda.

29:02.390 --> 29:05.391
<i> - So do you know</i>
<i> why Lavigne wants to see you?</i>

29:05.469 --> 29:08.061
- He probably has
more questions.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.747
Thanks for the clothes.

29:09.898 --> 29:11.990
I don't even want
to know how much they cost.

29:12.067 --> 29:14.126
- I wouldn't tell you anyway.

29:15.496 --> 29:18.814
- I never had a real like,
female friend.

29:18.832 --> 29:22.651
The girls in my business
will cut ya!

29:22.653 --> 29:24.595
(phone buzzing)

29:25.264 --> 29:27.155
- You okay?
- Yeah.

29:27.157 --> 29:29.266
I just always think it's him.

29:29.417 --> 29:31.343
And I just hate being scared.

29:31.419 --> 29:34.062
Embarrassing.
- I know what you mean.

29:35.775 --> 29:40.185
- You never told me about what
happened to you which is...

29:40.262 --> 29:42.696
no pressure, of course.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.175
- Sophomore year,

29:47.177 --> 29:51.196
I was on my way back to the dorm
and he raped me on the grass.

29:51.273 --> 29:54.625
Just out in the open.
How brazen is that?

29:54.776 --> 29:57.127
He was captain of the rugby team

29:57.354 --> 30:00.613
and our parents traveled
in the same circle.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.950
So they got together
and worked it out.

30:04.695 --> 30:08.514
You know... and his parents
were very embarrassed.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.201
The thing is...

30:13.203 --> 30:15.628
I wouldn't have
reported it anyway.

30:15.648 --> 30:17.722
I'm not brave, like you.

30:17.875 --> 30:20.150
- You annihilate people online.

30:20.227 --> 30:22.210
- That's different.

30:22.229 --> 30:24.154
- Don't you ever...

30:24.231 --> 30:26.806
think about him
raping other women?

30:26.826 --> 30:30.035
- Of course.
But I was just a kid.

30:32.723 --> 30:35.891
- You have to stop letting him
get away with it at some point.

30:35.893 --> 30:36.983
(knocking on door)

30:37.002 --> 30:39.127
- Open up, bish!

30:42.157 --> 30:44.299
Hey, uh...
- Hi.

30:52.017 --> 30:56.261
Okay, you two need to stop
acting like bitches
and just be civil.

30:56.413 --> 30:58.188
- He's the one
who has the problem.

30:58.265 --> 31:00.173
- Ah, no,
I just don't like you.

31:00.250 --> 31:03.527
Can I talk to you
privately, please?
- Sorry.

31:07.849 --> 31:09.533
- That woman is...
- Don't start.

31:09.684 --> 31:12.352
Hey, hey, I saw the heads
in the ashtray.

31:12.429 --> 31:14.112
Of the photos of you
and Zeke from the wall.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.265
- We were just playing around
and if you came here
to bitch about Tess...

31:17.284 --> 31:21.295
- No, um,
the prosecutor called me in.

31:22.864 --> 31:25.031
- He said he would...
talk to people.

31:25.125 --> 31:30.220
- Yeah well, uh, he asked
if you and Zeke had sex before.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.308
- What did you say?

31:36.803 --> 31:39.396
- Before I recommend
whether to bring your case
to trial,

31:39.547 --> 31:41.547
I have to weigh
the likelihood of a conviction.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.642
- Right.

31:43.794 --> 31:47.646
- Based on witness interviews,
on the fact that you had
consensual sex with Mr. Thompson

31:47.798 --> 31:50.482
prior to the allegation,
which you withheld from me.

31:50.634 --> 31:54.302
- So sorry, I just...
what are you implying exactly?

31:54.396 --> 31:57.581
- I'm not bringing charges.

32:00.402 --> 32:03.812
- Uh, is this
because he's famous, or...?

32:03.830 --> 32:07.482
- No. You would be eviscerated
on the stand.
- Mm-hmm.

32:07.484 --> 32:11.319
- Between the provocations
on social media,

32:11.321 --> 32:13.413
the drinking
and the promiscuity.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.914
- Got it.

32:14.934 --> 32:16.975
There it is.

32:18.103 --> 32:21.012
I'm a drunk and I'm a slut

32:21.089 --> 32:23.014
so I deserved it.

32:23.167 --> 32:24.257
- Okay, look.
- Cool.

32:24.334 --> 32:25.667
- If you're interested,

32:25.686 --> 32:27.277
I can refer you
to a mental health professional.

32:27.429 --> 32:29.171
- You know what?
I'm actually good.

32:29.189 --> 32:31.673
Um...
(clattering)

32:31.675 --> 32:34.359
I sincerely...

32:34.436 --> 32:38.205
hope that you go to hell, sir.

32:48.025 --> 32:51.218
- Now is not a good time
for you to be here.

32:52.972 --> 32:55.880
- Brenda, I am so, so sorry.

32:56.033 --> 32:57.365
C'mon, c'mon.

32:57.701 --> 33:00.343
Can you stop being mad at me
and just let me...
be here for you?

33:00.420 --> 33:01.886
- Be here. Be here for me

33:01.963 --> 33:05.232
like the way you were here
for me with that douchebag DA?

33:06.819 --> 33:08.668
Zeke's performing
at Goldie's tonight,

33:08.670 --> 33:11.471
kicking off his tour
before moving up to arenas

33:11.490 --> 33:15.325
where he will help himself
to a buffet of female fans.

33:15.402 --> 33:19.645
- Look, the DA screwed up
big time, okay.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.240
But... but... um, it's over now

33:22.317 --> 33:25.335
and... and maybe you have
a chance to move on.

33:25.412 --> 33:28.821
- What a ridiculous
little man you are.

33:29.657 --> 33:31.508
- And you're a pathetic...
- Don't.

33:31.659 --> 33:33.493
- Lonely ...
- Okay.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.678
- Seriously?

33:34.829 --> 33:37.830
- Okay Chad,
just, just go, just go.
- Me?

33:37.850 --> 33:40.242
She's... don't you see
that she's messing
with your head, Brenda?

33:40.260 --> 33:42.410
- I'd like to report
an intruder.

33:42.429 --> 33:44.095
He's not leaving
and he's getting violent.

33:44.172 --> 33:47.507
Oh, you're gonna pull that, huh?
Are you co-signing
this behavior?

33:47.526 --> 33:49.918
- He's leaving, hang up.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.436
Hang up.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.105
Please just go. I...

33:54.258 --> 33:56.992
Sorry.
- I'm out.

33:58.278 --> 34:00.996
- He doesn't understand.
He can't.

34:03.433 --> 34:06.710
I saw what you posted
on the rapist's Instagram.

34:08.863 --> 34:12.440
The only way you'll understand
the burning shame of
what you did to me

34:12.459 --> 34:16.094
is if someone pours gasoline
on you and lights a match.

34:17.447 --> 34:20.182
- That was the wine talking.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.977
- In vino veritas.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.213
- In wine, truth, Brenda.

34:27.232 --> 34:30.642
- The only way
you'll understand

34:30.794 --> 34:34.979
the burning shame
of what you did to me

34:35.056 --> 34:38.983
is if someone pours gasoline
on you

34:39.136 --> 34:41.661
and lights a match.

34:43.565 --> 34:46.491
Do you know who wrote that,
Ms. Richards?

34:46.643 --> 34:48.585
- Brenda posted it

34:48.662 --> 34:51.830
the night before Zeke Thompson
performed at Goldie's.

34:51.924 --> 34:54.758
- And you attended
this performance in person.

34:57.412 --> 34:59.554
(crowd cheering)

35:03.769 --> 35:05.844
- Yeah!

35:05.996 --> 35:07.920
Y'all can't kill me!!

35:07.998 --> 35:10.148
Ah-ha!

35:12.519 --> 35:14.427
Woohoo!

35:15.672 --> 35:18.782
Alright, thank you for the love.
Thank you everyone.

35:18.859 --> 35:21.509
Uh, I don't want to start heavy

35:21.528 --> 35:24.454
but the last two weeks
have been a little rough.

35:25.198 --> 35:30.776
I was accused of doing
something that I did not do.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.296
- He did do it
and they let him go.

35:33.373 --> 35:35.615
No one did anything about it.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.259
- Except for you.

35:38.137 --> 35:40.470
- Hey, break a leg.

35:40.622 --> 35:43.140
I'm never gonna forget
your loyalty.

35:44.176 --> 35:46.217
- Hey, I got it, man.
No worries.

35:46.294 --> 35:48.728
- Zeke Thompson.
- Yeah.

35:49.631 --> 35:51.982
Jesus. God!

35:52.133 --> 35:54.693
What is wrong with you...
Aaah!

35:56.380 --> 35:57.562
Zeke!

35:57.714 --> 35:59.489
Somebody call the cops.
(Zeke shouting in pain)

35:59.566 --> 36:03.577
- I had to stop him
before he hurt other women.

36:07.649 --> 36:11.317
- Rape is a heinous crime,
I'm not denying that.

36:11.395 --> 36:13.745
But we have a legal system,
imperfect as it is.

36:13.897 --> 36:15.672
- The legal system did nothing!

36:15.823 --> 36:17.990
- Brenda Kramer may not have

36:18.010 --> 36:21.178
explicitly instructed you
to light Zeke Thompson on fire,

36:21.254 --> 36:23.829
but she planted the idea
in your head

36:23.907 --> 36:27.409
and encouraged you,
however indirectly,
to act on it.

36:27.411 --> 36:30.169
The fact is, you wouldn't have
done what you did

36:30.189 --> 36:33.732
if Brenda Kramer hadn't posted
on social media.

36:35.101 --> 36:37.527
- I did it for you, Bren.

36:39.940 --> 36:41.573
(door opens)

36:48.373 --> 36:50.615
- Rapist!
- You should leave.

36:50.767 --> 36:52.434
- They should have killed you.

36:52.452 --> 36:54.269
- Order.
Order.

36:54.862 --> 36:57.214
(gavel banging)
I'll have order.

36:58.275 --> 37:01.509
I'll have order or you'll be
removed from the court.

37:05.615 --> 37:06.890
- I'm a comedian.

37:07.467 --> 37:10.376
We say things.
We say crazy things.

37:10.454 --> 37:14.305
We say things that make
people laugh and shock people.

37:14.458 --> 37:15.974
Immature and childish maybe,

37:16.126 --> 37:21.463
but it's... we're not,
our intent is never
to cause violence.

37:21.481 --> 37:22.822
There's...

37:23.984 --> 37:27.819
what happened to Zeke
was not my intent.

37:27.971 --> 37:30.163
- It wasn't?

37:34.419 --> 37:37.662
Violence wasn't your intent.

37:37.739 --> 37:39.089
- No.

37:39.165 --> 37:41.466
- Look at him.

37:43.503 --> 37:44.410
- You did this.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.596
- Your Honor!
- Counsellor.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.564
- Pick up. Pick up.
(line ringing)

37:58.835 --> 38:01.945
- Who is this
and how did you get my number?

38:02.022 --> 38:03.596
- It's me.

38:04.616 --> 38:08.676
<i> - I know you probably</i>
<i> never wanna talk to me again</i>

38:09.346 --> 38:11.437
<i> but I just wanted to let you</i>
<i> know</i>

38:11.515 --> 38:13.623
<i> that I've been, um...</i>
<i> (sniffling)</i>

38:13.700 --> 38:16.167
going back to meetings.

38:17.129 --> 38:19.462
And if there is anyone

38:19.614 --> 38:25.093
that I need to make amends
with, it... it's you.

38:26.621 --> 38:32.642
Um, I don't assume you're
following my legal situation.

38:34.128 --> 38:36.220
<i> And um...</i>

38:36.315 --> 38:41.067
today the verdict comes in

38:42.729 --> 38:45.638
<i>and I know this is a lot to ask,</i>

38:45.715 --> 38:48.974
<i> especially with...</i>

38:49.052 --> 38:51.903
how badly I treated you,

38:53.406 --> 38:58.501
<i> but I was just wondering</i>
<i> if there is any way</i>
<i> that you can come up here?</i>

38:58.728 --> 39:02.172
I just don't wanna stand up
there alone, you know.

39:06.903 --> 39:09.179
Uh...

39:11.741 --> 39:14.601
you were a good friend to me.

39:31.595 --> 39:34.162
(soft music)

39:43.364 --> 39:46.049
- Has the jury
reached a verdict?

39:46.200 --> 39:48.760
- We have, Your Honor.

39:52.298 --> 39:54.724
- Will the defendant
please rise?

39:57.562 --> 40:00.730
- To the count of the
indictment, aggravated mayhem,

40:01.716 --> 40:03.625
how does the jury find?

40:04.385 --> 40:07.720
- Not guilty, Your Honor.
- Oh, God.

40:07.739 --> 40:11.056
- The jury is dismissed and
we thank you for your service.

40:11.559 --> 40:14.318
- Thank you for everything.
- The court is adjourned.

40:14.471 --> 40:16.996
- Take care of yourself.
- All rise.

40:32.172 --> 40:34.656
- Bren, aren't you relieved?

40:34.658 --> 40:36.683
- Not really.

40:37.844 --> 40:40.061
Zeke...

40:41.923 --> 40:44.899
I did not mean for this
to happen.

40:45.669 --> 40:47.259
- Yeah, well, it did.

40:47.279 --> 40:50.021
- I did not know
that Tess was unstable.

40:50.173 --> 40:51.614
I had no idea.

40:51.766 --> 40:54.993
I couldn't... I missed the signs
and she was there for me.

40:57.605 --> 40:59.030
- Apologize.

40:59.182 --> 41:00.531
You raped her!

41:00.625 --> 41:03.609
- Move, please.
- Tess should've killed you!

41:03.628 --> 41:06.713
- Oh my God, please let him go.
Please.

41:16.700 --> 41:18.791
I know you're mad

41:18.868 --> 41:20.718
but hurting them
is not the answer.

41:20.795 --> 41:23.563
- What are we supposed to do?

41:24.966 --> 41:26.733
- I don't know.

41:29.488 --> 41:31.696
- Let's go home.
