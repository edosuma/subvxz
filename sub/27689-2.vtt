00:45.489 --> 00:47.488
Steady!

00:47.489 --> 00:49.488
Go on! Steady as she goes!

00:49.489 --> 00:51.227
That's it. Come on, we've got it.

00:51.228 --> 00:52.488
Go on.

00:52.489 --> 00:54.130
Steady, go on!

00:54.131 --> 00:55.328
That's it.

00:55.329 --> 00:56.488
Whoa!

00:56.489 --> 00:57.848
Now you hold it there.

00:59.529 --> 01:01.489
Good lad.

03:55.689 --> 03:57.848
- Aiden.
- Ma'am.

03:57.849 --> 03:59.688
So, what have we got?

03:59.689 --> 04:01.528
- Male fatality.
- Mm-hm.

04:01.529 --> 04:03.528
- Teenage lad.
- Ah.

04:03.529 --> 04:05.488
Stabbed sometime late last night.

04:07.329 --> 04:09.488
- Got any ID?
- Nothing so far.

04:09.489 --> 04:12.488
No wallet, no phone. Pockets were empty.

04:12.489 --> 04:14.488
What about CCTV?

04:14.489 --> 04:16.488
Apparently all the cameras
are on the blink.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.757
Oh, they would be, wouldn't they?

04:18.757 --> 04:19.857
Ma'am.

04:19.858 --> 04:22.488
I've just spoken to the yard owner,
Gary Mincham.

04:22.489 --> 04:25.488
And he said he locked up last night,
left around 9:15.

04:25.489 --> 04:28.489
Yeah, well, I'll need to talk to him
soon enough.

04:28.923 --> 04:30.488
Get statements from that lot.

04:30.489 --> 04:31.963
Ma'am.

04:46.963 --> 04:48.488
Morning, Malcolm.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.488
So, what can you tell us?

04:50.489 --> 04:53.085
Single stab wound to the lower abdomen.

04:53.086 --> 04:56.883
From the look of all this blood,
probably sliced through an artery.

05:02.689 --> 05:05.528
I say he was stabbed
behind that boat over there.

05:05.529 --> 05:09.689
Manages to crawl,
ends up dead where we found him.

05:13.083 --> 05:14.805
Shoe tread here.

05:14.806 --> 05:18.488
Probably the victim's own trainers.
There's blood all over the soles.

05:18.489 --> 05:20.489
They look brand new.

05:20.843 --> 05:23.363
And there's some bling here.

05:25.009 --> 05:27.488
Where's he getting money for that?

05:27.489 --> 05:29.488
I'll leave that one
for you to work out, shall I?

05:29.489 --> 05:31.488
Murder weapon?

05:31.489 --> 05:34.008
Well, be easy to miss in all this junk.

05:34.009 --> 05:35.488
I'll do a full sweep of the yard

05:35.489 --> 05:37.488
as soon as you get out
from under our feet.

05:37.489 --> 05:39.488
Well, we'll try not to
cramp your style, love.

05:39.489 --> 05:40.529
Thank you.

05:49.489 --> 05:52.488
So how did the lad get in here,
if it's all locked up?

05:52.489 --> 05:54.488
Didn't swim here.

05:54.489 --> 05:56.489
Hole in the fence.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.489
Ground's been well-trodden.

06:06.883 --> 06:09.002
There's some fibres snagged here.

06:09.003 --> 06:10.883
Could have been anyone's.

06:11.489 --> 06:14.488
Now, the wire's bent inwards.

06:14.489 --> 06:17.328
So that's caught the clothes of
someone stepping out.

06:17.329 --> 06:20.488
That rules out our mystery lad,
he's not going anywhere.

06:20.489 --> 06:25.009
So, what? In a hurry, careless,
or nothing at all?

06:26.216 --> 06:28.696
Get forensics moved over here.

06:30.489 --> 06:32.203
Mr Mincham?

06:33.396 --> 06:36.396
DCI Stanhope.
Now, I take it this is your yard?

06:36.421 --> 06:37.421
Aye, that's right.

06:37.489 --> 06:39.168
And you were the last to leave
last night?

06:39.169 --> 06:42.488
Keel repair. Owner needed his boat
back out at sea.

06:42.489 --> 06:45.328
Did you see anyone else when you left,

06:45.329 --> 06:46.488
hanging around outside?

06:46.489 --> 06:48.528
Not that I remember.

06:48.529 --> 06:52.488
And is there any recent trouble
we should know about?

06:52.489 --> 06:55.168
Trespassing, break-ins?

06:55.169 --> 06:57.488
Local kids sometimes
climb through the fence.

06:57.489 --> 07:00.009
You wanna get those cameras fixed.

07:00.522 --> 07:02.002
Never seem to get round to it.

07:04.849 --> 07:07.488
Now, I'm gonna need a list
of all your employees,

07:07.489 --> 07:10.488
customers, boat owners,
anyone who has access to the yard.

07:10.489 --> 07:12.488
That'll all be in the office.

07:12.489 --> 07:14.489
Well, better go see to it, then.

07:22.489 --> 07:23.489
Who was it found the body?

07:23.490 --> 07:27.168
A local copper, PC Turnley.

07:27.169 --> 07:29.489
The police were called out
on a suspected break-in.

07:36.489 --> 07:40.488
- PC Townley, isn't it?
- Turnley, ma'am. Sean.

07:40.489 --> 07:44.089
Now, DC Lockhart tells me
it was you found the body.

07:44.090 --> 07:46.488
Aye, routine callout. End of shift.

07:46.489 --> 07:49.488
- He's not from round here.
- You seem very sure of that.

07:49.489 --> 07:53.002
I've policed this town for years.
I know most of the local kids.

07:53.003 --> 07:56.488
And they all meet up in the yard,
do they, these local kids?

07:56.489 --> 07:57.489
That hole in the fence?

07:57.490 --> 07:59.849
They know it's somewhere
they'll not be disturbed.

07:59.850 --> 08:02.603
I mean, they can pass a bottle
around, smoke a bit of weed.

08:03.489 --> 08:07.489
Well, there's never been
any trouble. I mean...

08:07.828 --> 08:09.188
not like this.

08:10.489 --> 08:12.107
Who was it phoned the police?

08:12.108 --> 08:14.489
Roy Brewer. Bit of a nuisance.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.488
Why do you say that?

08:16.489 --> 08:18.488
He calls us out twice a week.

08:18.489 --> 08:20.328
He set himself up as
a neighbourhood watch.

08:20.329 --> 08:21.488
Give us ten minutes,

08:21.489 --> 08:23.689
we'll get you logged out,
we'll go talk to him together.

08:35.489 --> 08:38.488
You told the police you saw
someone acting suspiciously.

08:38.489 --> 08:41.847
I was walking the dog, clocked him
loitering around the gate.

08:41.849 --> 08:44.489
- Place was deserted.
- And what time was this?

08:44.861 --> 08:46.860
Must have been about ten.

08:46.861 --> 08:50.860
The call was logged at 10:15, ma'am.

08:50.861 --> 08:52.860
I took a few photos.

08:52.861 --> 08:54.066
With my mobile.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.860
Oh, well, let's have a look.

08:55.861 --> 08:58.283
That's the fella.
Jeans and a padded jacket.

08:59.861 --> 09:01.482
That could be anyone.

09:01.483 --> 09:02.861
Can we take this with us?

09:04.861 --> 09:06.860
Yeah. Thanks, love,
you've been a great help.

09:06.861 --> 09:08.860
The whole town's gone to the dogs.

09:08.861 --> 09:10.860
- Hmm?
- I mean, they've even broken in here.

09:10.861 --> 09:12.387
When was this?

09:12.388 --> 09:14.860
Must have been about, what,
six weeks ago?

09:14.861 --> 09:16.860
Came down to find the door kicked in.

09:16.861 --> 09:18.860
Not that the police did anything.

09:18.861 --> 09:20.212
We followed it up.

09:20.213 --> 09:21.860
Anything taken?

09:21.861 --> 09:24.860
Till was empty. But I still
had to replace all the locks.

09:25.862 --> 09:30.861
Well, we know where you are, love,
if anything else should crop up.

09:32.061 --> 09:34.220
It's the last thing her dad needs.

09:34.221 --> 09:35.860
- Who?
- Kayleigh.

09:35.861 --> 09:37.860
She's Gary Mincham's lass.

09:37.861 --> 09:39.861
Turns up for work
whenever she feels like it.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.683
Right. We'll have a word. Thanks.

09:50.861 --> 09:53.861
Have you got a minute, love?
Kayleigh, isn't it?

09:55.061 --> 09:56.900
Dock my wages if I'm not careful.

09:56.901 --> 09:58.861
Ah, you're all right, pet.

09:59.901 --> 10:02.700
Have you been working here long, then?

10:02.701 --> 10:03.861
A few months now.

10:04.861 --> 10:07.097
That must have been a shock for your dad,

10:07.098 --> 10:08.861
finding that lad in his yard.

10:09.740 --> 10:11.740
Suppose it must have, yeah.

10:11.765 --> 10:13.765
You didn't see him this morning?

10:13.861 --> 10:15.861
I haven't lived at home for a while.

10:16.603 --> 10:19.860
Ah, well,
you ought to give him a ring, love.

10:19.861 --> 10:21.861
Haven't had the chance.

10:23.861 --> 10:26.717
- Late night, was it?
- Bit of a party down at the beach.

10:26.718 --> 10:28.018
Ooh.,

10:28.043 --> 10:29.885
Came straight in to do the breakfasts.

10:31.861 --> 10:33.220
I better get these washed.

10:33.221 --> 10:35.221
You're all right, lass.

10:43.861 --> 10:46.900
Our witness, Roy Brewer,
his beef with the police,

10:46.901 --> 10:48.860
is that something we should know about?

10:48.861 --> 10:51.123
A lad had been giving him some lip.

10:51.541 --> 10:54.220
Roy gave him a clip for his trouble.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.861
He's lucky he got off with a caution.

10:59.081 --> 11:02.081
Right, well, you'd better get off,
write up your notes.

11:02.106 --> 11:03.403
Ma'am.

11:05.861 --> 11:09.060
Police find a body in her dad's yard

11:09.061 --> 11:11.455
and she doesn't even call to check in?

11:11.456 --> 11:13.861
Teenagers. She was probably busy.

11:14.243 --> 11:16.860
You'd find time, wouldn't you?

11:16.861 --> 11:18.860
Something like that.

11:18.861 --> 11:19.861
Kenny.

11:19.862 --> 11:21.860
We've got the deceased on camera, ma'am.

11:21.861 --> 11:25.860
He arrived in Peyton yesterday at 16:46.

11:25.861 --> 11:28.586
- 'Travelled alone.'
- 16:46.

11:28.587 --> 11:31.220
Yes. That would put him on a train
out of Newcastle.

11:31.221 --> 11:35.424
Good work, Kenny. We'll see you
back at the station for a briefing.

11:35.425 --> 11:37.043
- 'Will do.'
- What?

11:37.955 --> 11:40.860
Took the train out of Newcastle
yesterday afternoon.

11:40.861 --> 11:42.126
What's he doing in Peyton?

11:42.127 --> 11:44.861
Well, he wasn't building
sand castles, I know that much.

11:49.520 --> 11:53.410
The teenage lad fatally stabbed
in Mincham's boatyard last night

11:53.435 --> 11:56.438
between the hours of 9:15 and 10:30.

11:56.463 --> 11:59.730
Now, he catches the train
from Newcastle over to Peyton,

11:59.755 --> 12:02.036
and a few hours later, he's murdered.

12:02.061 --> 12:04.291
We've run the victim's prints, ma'am.

12:04.292 --> 12:06.510
No record. Still no idea who he is.

12:06.511 --> 12:08.220
So, what DO we have?

12:08.221 --> 12:10.542
A witness calls the police,

12:10.543 --> 12:13.439
reports someone acting suspiciously
outside the boatyard.

12:13.440 --> 12:17.220
Now, this is Roy Brewer, who works
in the cafe down on the prom.

12:17.221 --> 12:19.424
Fancies himself as
the neighbourhood watch.

12:19.425 --> 12:21.526
Took some snaps on his mobile.

12:21.527 --> 12:23.118
Tech are still trying to enhance them.

12:23.119 --> 12:25.123
Yeah, let's have a look.

12:26.547 --> 12:28.547
Well, that could be our victim.

12:29.534 --> 12:30.574
Or the killer.

12:31.283 --> 12:32.860
Could be keeping lookout.

12:32.861 --> 12:35.860
Aye. Could be unrelated.

12:35.861 --> 12:38.860
I've had some intel back
from mispers, ma'am.

12:38.861 --> 12:41.540
Male juveniles currently missing
in Newcastle.

12:41.541 --> 12:43.860
Ah. All just kids.

12:43.861 --> 12:45.403
Six of them.

12:46.567 --> 12:48.243
Ma'am.

12:53.861 --> 12:55.203
He's our lad.

12:55.740 --> 12:57.523
That's him.

13:00.714 --> 13:05.394
Caden Lennon, reported missing
from care home six weeks ago.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.003
Caden had lived here since he was 11.

13:18.004 --> 13:20.523
Been in care half his life.

13:20.524 --> 13:22.683
What about his parents?

13:22.684 --> 13:26.004
Mam's dead. Dad walked out
when he was still a bairn.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.890
Now, you reported Caden missing
six weeks ago.

13:30.483 --> 13:33.004
He started staying out late.

13:33.403 --> 13:35.004
Sometimes, he wouldn't come home at all.

13:36.044 --> 13:38.003
He'd always answer my texts eventually,

13:38.004 --> 13:40.004
just to let us know he was safe.

13:41.004 --> 13:43.044
The day he disappeared, his phone died.

13:43.403 --> 13:45.204
No word since, nothing.

13:47.851 --> 13:50.851
Did you have any other
kind of trouble with him?

13:50.876 --> 13:52.876
You all right, love?

13:59.004 --> 14:01.003
Caden hated being in care.

14:01.004 --> 14:02.809
The stigma, the rules.

14:02.810 --> 14:04.523
That put you at odds, did it?

14:04.524 --> 14:08.629
We talked about a pathway plan
to smooth his way for turning 18.

14:08.630 --> 14:11.363
Then he tells us he's got himself a job.

14:11.364 --> 14:13.203
Oh, where was this?

14:13.204 --> 14:16.003
Ferry Cross estate. He grew up there.

14:16.004 --> 14:17.578
I know it.

14:17.579 --> 14:21.003
Then you know it's not a place for
an impressionable teenager.

14:21.004 --> 14:23.523
So this job, who's he working for?

14:24.004 --> 14:26.004
A fellow called Dave Miller.

14:26.483 --> 14:28.399
Runs the community centre.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.204
- You don't sound too impressed.
- I just don't like his attitude.

14:31.643 --> 14:34.003
Filling Caden's head with ideas.

14:34.004 --> 14:37.003
Have you spoken to this Dave
since the lad went missing?

14:37.004 --> 14:39.083
He told us Caden had packed it all in.

14:39.850 --> 14:41.583
Hadn't seen him since.

14:41.608 --> 14:43.003
And when was this?

14:43.004 --> 14:45.003
Just before he went missing.

14:45.004 --> 14:46.843
It doesn't make sense.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.163
He'd never have abandoned Tyler.

14:51.004 --> 14:52.403
Who's Tyler?

14:53.524 --> 14:55.004
His brother.

14:56.424 --> 14:57.944
Sorry, I thought you knew.

14:57.969 --> 15:00.163
The pair of them shared a room.

15:03.004 --> 15:05.003
Police liaison officer called round
this morning,

15:05.004 --> 15:08.003
I woke him to tell him the news.
He hasn't left his room since.

15:11.004 --> 15:15.004
Tyler, the police are here.

15:19.270 --> 15:21.910
They need to ask you some questions.

15:32.004 --> 15:35.004
And you hadn't been in touch
with your brother since he left?

15:37.004 --> 15:39.043
I think he'd lost his phone.

15:39.044 --> 15:41.724
Social services
applied for a tracking order.

15:41.725 --> 15:43.203
It was switched off.

15:43.924 --> 15:46.924
So you've no idea
why he was up in Peyton?

15:48.004 --> 15:51.004
- We used to go there on day trips.
- With their mam.

15:52.364 --> 15:54.524
She always liked it by the sea.

15:56.397 --> 15:58.557
Did Caden have friends there?

15:58.582 --> 15:59.763
I dunno.

16:01.823 --> 16:04.183
Now, I need to ask you this, love.

16:06.004 --> 16:09.003
Was your brother involved in
any criminal activity?

16:09.004 --> 16:10.363
No!

16:10.650 --> 16:14.203
Now, we know he got a job
over on the Ferry Cross estate.

16:14.364 --> 16:17.203
Can you think of anyone
he might have fallen out with?

16:17.204 --> 16:20.044
Caden might have had some issues,
but he was a good lad.

16:22.443 --> 16:24.611
Right, well, we'll need to go
through some of his things.

16:24.612 --> 16:27.003
- I don't want them touched.
- They need to find out what happened.

16:27.004 --> 16:30.004
It was your fault he left!
You were always on at him!

16:35.364 --> 16:37.363
There should be some clothes
in the wardrobe.

16:37.857 --> 16:40.857
- And boxes under the bed.
- Ah, we'll manage, love. You go.

16:47.663 --> 16:49.663
If Caden was homeless, sleeping rough,

16:50.004 --> 16:52.004
might explain why no one missed him.

16:52.604 --> 16:55.723
New trainers, gold chain. Doesn't fit.

16:56.323 --> 17:00.004
See if you can find anything here
we can work with.

17:07.003 --> 17:09.003
I thought you might need a photo.

17:10.704 --> 17:12.704
His 16th birthday.

17:13.003 --> 17:14.298
We baked him a cake.

17:15.002 --> 17:18.003
Tyler worshipped his brother.
He fell apart when he left.

17:19.003 --> 17:22.523
He's grieving, love. He didn't mean
those things he said.

17:23.450 --> 17:25.450
I feel like I've failed them both.

17:28.044 --> 17:32.003
Yeah, he showed up here one morning,
said he was looking for work.

17:32.004 --> 17:35.003
So what did this job entail?

17:35.004 --> 17:36.836
General dogsbody, really.

17:36.837 --> 17:39.203
We get funding
for a couple of employment schemes.

17:39.204 --> 17:42.003
Well, we know he grew up on this estate.

17:42.004 --> 17:45.003
Yeah, I think he felt a connection.

17:45.004 --> 17:47.003
Only place he ever called home.

17:47.004 --> 17:50.683
Most people that I know
wanna give the place a wide berth.

17:50.684 --> 17:53.003
Do you have a problem with gangs
on this estate?

17:53.004 --> 17:55.003
Well, most of these kids
have been written off.

17:55.004 --> 17:58.003
Gangs, drugs, knife crime.

17:58.004 --> 18:00.003
We do what we can
to keep them out of trouble.

18:00.004 --> 18:02.003
Did Caden get involved in any of that?

18:02.004 --> 18:06.004
I warned him to stay out of it.
Voice of experience.

18:07.482 --> 18:09.003
So, he asks you for a job,

18:09.004 --> 18:11.003
and he packs it in
a couple of weeks later.

18:11.004 --> 18:13.003
There must have been a reason.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.003
He started turning up late
for his shifts.

18:15.004 --> 18:17.003
Said he had better things to do.

18:17.004 --> 18:18.683
And you've no idea

18:18.684 --> 18:21.004
where he might have been
this last six weeks?

18:21.403 --> 18:23.044
I wish I could tell you.

18:34.004 --> 18:36.003
So, what are we thinking?

18:36.004 --> 18:38.638
Gets into trouble with a gang,
leaves in a hurry.

18:38.639 --> 18:41.003
They find out where he was, go after him.

18:41.004 --> 18:43.003
Fits with a stabbing, doesn't it?

18:44.005 --> 18:45.524
Oi!

18:47.004 --> 18:49.003
Wouldn't harm to knock on some doors.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.003
No one's going to talk to us.

18:51.004 --> 18:54.004
Send everyone into the cracks.

18:58.204 --> 18:59.683
Aiden.

19:04.697 --> 19:08.697
Get onto the gangs unit.
Any intel they can give us.

19:10.364 --> 19:13.650
We found traces of benzoylecgonine
in the victim's urine.

19:13.651 --> 19:16.003
That's crack cocaine.

19:16.004 --> 19:18.662
So if the lad was using,

19:18.663 --> 19:22.003
chances are his death was drugs-related.

19:22.004 --> 19:25.003
We found sharps and baggies dumped
on the wasteland behind the yard.

19:25.004 --> 19:26.804
He wasn't the only one getting high.

19:26.805 --> 19:28.731
What about his injuries?

19:28.732 --> 19:32.003
The knife nicked
the common hepatic artery.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.683
Extensive internal bleeding,

19:33.684 --> 19:35.611
heart rate spikes, blood pressure rises.

19:35.612 --> 19:38.003
Well, he would have bled out in minutes.

19:38.004 --> 19:40.004
You might wanna take a look at his hands.

19:45.004 --> 19:47.003
No defence wounds.

19:47.004 --> 19:49.004
Exactly.

19:49.743 --> 19:52.093
Nothing to indicate
he put up any kind of struggle.

19:52.118 --> 19:55.768
- That suggests he knew his killer.
- Indeed.

19:56.004 --> 19:59.003
Any other injuries I should know about?

19:59.004 --> 20:02.004
Hairline fracture
on the radius of the right arm here.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.523
Probably years old.

20:09.757 --> 20:12.757
What about those shoe treads
we found at the scene?

20:13.004 --> 20:15.003
They matched with the victim's trainers.

20:15.004 --> 20:17.747
He's stabbed, staggers forward
into his own blood.

20:17.748 --> 20:20.004
So, nothing to help me find his killer?

20:21.004 --> 20:24.004
I did recover some fibres from
inside the knife wound.

20:24.610 --> 20:26.650
They didn't match what he was wearing.

20:27.884 --> 20:31.884
If the weapon was concealed
in the assailant's pocket...

20:31.909 --> 20:35.109
So, the fibres could have
transferred onto the blade?

20:35.563 --> 20:38.003
Polyester-cotton mix.

20:38.004 --> 20:41.003
Matches the fibres
that were snagged on the fence.

20:41.004 --> 20:43.004
Possibly the lining of the jacket.

20:44.883 --> 20:46.883
It's a good job I spotted those.

20:47.123 --> 20:49.004
Well, you got lucky.

20:55.004 --> 20:57.004
Ah, just caught you.

20:58.623 --> 21:01.968
Now, these kids who meet up
in that boatyard,

21:02.403 --> 21:04.699
smoking a bit of weed, you said.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.280
Well, you're gonna get that in any town.

21:06.723 --> 21:11.363
Caden Lennon had been using,
the night he died, crack cocaine.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.283
- That puts a new slant on things.
- Aye, doesn't it just?

21:17.004 --> 21:18.004
Look...

21:18.005 --> 21:22.523
these past few months,
we have been a bit stretched.

21:22.524 --> 21:25.003
This recent spike in crime,

21:25.004 --> 21:28.003
robberies, shoplifting,
a couple of violent assaults,

21:28.004 --> 21:30.003
that's usually drugs in the mix.

21:30.004 --> 21:33.315
Yeah. People think
it's all Z-Cars up here.

21:33.723 --> 21:36.212
Seaside plods with no idea.

21:36.213 --> 21:39.003
Yeah. Working all hours, no support.

21:39.004 --> 21:41.003
- It's easy to feel overwhelmed.
- Mm-hm.

21:41.004 --> 21:43.003
They've even closed down the front desk.

21:46.364 --> 21:50.004
So where was this lad
getting the gear from?

21:56.004 --> 21:58.003
Right, let's do the rounds
with the photo,

21:58.004 --> 22:00.004
see if anyone bites.

22:17.004 --> 22:19.003
Doing a bit of covert surveillance?

22:19.004 --> 22:21.684
There's no law against it.

22:21.685 --> 22:25.003
You've been cautioned before
about community policing.

22:25.004 --> 22:27.003
That lad you assaulted.

22:27.004 --> 22:29.843
I gave the boy a slap, that's all.

22:29.844 --> 22:32.004
There's plenty who'd say he deserved it.

22:34.844 --> 22:37.003
Ever seen this lad?

22:37.004 --> 22:40.003
Yeah, I've seen him a few times.

22:40.004 --> 22:42.003
Hanging around outside.

22:42.004 --> 22:43.668
You sure about that?

22:43.669 --> 22:46.003
I thought he might have been
cadging money.

22:46.004 --> 22:48.003
He's seen him.

22:48.004 --> 22:50.004
I hear the dead lad had been stabbed.

22:53.004 --> 22:55.003
Who told you that?

22:55.004 --> 22:57.003
Just talk at the club.

22:57.004 --> 22:58.004
Which club's this?

22:58.005 --> 22:59.323
The Yacht Club.

23:02.684 --> 23:04.203
Can I take that?

23:04.664 --> 23:08.664
Word of advice, Mr Brewer,
leave this to the police.

23:11.004 --> 23:13.003
How did he know the lad had been stabbed?

23:13.004 --> 23:14.204
Didn't come from us.

23:34.004 --> 23:35.004
Tony Briggs?

23:35.603 --> 23:37.004
Who's asking?

23:37.923 --> 23:41.243
DCI Stanhope,
Northumberland and City Police.

23:41.830 --> 23:45.830
We're trying to trace
the recent movements of this lad.

23:48.004 --> 23:50.523
- No one I know.
- Are you sure about that?

23:50.524 --> 23:54.003
Face has been seen here. Several times.

23:54.004 --> 23:56.523
I might have seen him
playing the machines.

23:56.524 --> 23:59.003
This place is a magnet for day-trippers.

23:59.004 --> 24:01.003
Oh, aye.

24:01.004 --> 24:05.004
And we've reason to believe
he was using drugs.

24:05.857 --> 24:07.697
And you think he bought them off me?

24:07.722 --> 24:10.882
We know you've got previous.
Possession with intent to supply.

24:11.004 --> 24:13.003
I've put all that behind us.

24:13.004 --> 24:15.003
Then you won't mind us
talking to some of your punters.

24:15.004 --> 24:18.003
- See if someone else can place him.
- Be my guest.

24:18.004 --> 24:21.003
And we'll also need access to your CCTV.

24:21.004 --> 24:23.278
Well, then, you'll need to
come back with a warrant.

24:23.279 --> 24:27.003
Ah, no, that'd give you time
to wipe the tapes, wouldn't it?

24:27.004 --> 24:30.003
This place is legit.
I've got nothing to hide.

24:30.004 --> 24:33.004
Then I suggest you wind your neck in
and let us do our job.

24:38.757 --> 24:41.043
And I'll leave that one to DS Healy.

25:05.364 --> 25:08.004
Can you give us a minute, love?

26:10.166 --> 26:12.845
Number on the card was unobtainable.

26:12.846 --> 26:14.205
Pay-as-you-go mobile.

26:14.206 --> 26:15.907
No surprises there then, Kenny.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.165
Tech have blown up those pictures
from Roy Brewer's mobile, ma'am.

26:19.166 --> 26:21.686
No hope of an ID.

26:23.561 --> 26:27.166
What's this transit van here,
parked on the road?

26:27.788 --> 26:31.165
Did Roy Brewer mention anything
about that in his statement?

26:31.166 --> 26:35.165
Mark, see if you can get a fix
on those plates.

26:35.166 --> 26:37.166
Let's see.

26:43.926 --> 26:47.966
Erm... Vehicle's registered to
Gary Mincham.

26:48.403 --> 26:51.166
Is it indeed?

26:59.166 --> 27:01.829
Is the gaffer about? Need another word.

27:01.830 --> 27:04.165
I'm gonna go and check in with forensics.

27:04.166 --> 27:05.762
Last time I looked, he was in the office.

27:05.763 --> 27:07.635
Didn't catch your name.

27:07.636 --> 27:10.165
Alan. Alan White.

27:10.166 --> 27:11.366
You worked here long?

27:11.843 --> 27:14.166
Few years now.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.166
Gary took us on as an apprentice.

27:19.166 --> 27:21.166
Don't let me keep you.

27:37.871 --> 27:41.871
We've got an ID for the dead lad.
I thought you'd like to know.

27:42.483 --> 27:44.921
Name of Caden Lennon.

27:44.922 --> 27:46.861
Doesn't mean anything to us.

27:46.862 --> 27:49.166
Been using drugs the day he was killed.

27:49.603 --> 27:51.611
Sounds like he was asking for trouble.

27:51.612 --> 27:54.614
And we know this yard is
the meeting point for addicts.

27:54.615 --> 27:56.507
If I'd ever clocked drugs in this yard,

27:56.508 --> 27:58.166
- I'd have...
- You'd what, love?

28:00.166 --> 28:02.166
I'd have put a stop to it.

28:05.520 --> 28:12.165
Now, you told us you locked up
at 9:15, night of the murder.

28:12.166 --> 28:13.365
Aye, that's right.

28:13.366 --> 28:17.165
So how come your transit's
still parked outside at 10?

28:17.166 --> 28:18.603
I walked home.

28:19.166 --> 28:21.166
I needed to clear me head.

28:22.150 --> 28:24.166
Any particular reason?

28:27.672 --> 28:29.672
Bailiffs delivered a summons
that morning.

28:29.698 --> 28:31.698
Unpaid debts.

28:31.723 --> 28:34.723
I was working out a way
to break it to the wife.

28:35.166 --> 28:38.165
Well, we know you owe the bank thousands.

28:38.166 --> 28:40.165
Ha! Been checking up on us?

28:40.166 --> 28:44.166
A body was found here, love.
We do the same with anyone.

28:45.551 --> 28:47.165
So how is business?

28:47.166 --> 28:49.526
Not much call for working boats anymore.

28:52.615 --> 28:54.165
We were getting by.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.843
Repairs and maintenance,
yachts in the marina.

28:56.870 --> 28:59.817
And then someone started undercutting us.

28:59.818 --> 29:03.576
We'd get a job lined up, customer
would pull out without warning.

29:03.577 --> 29:06.165
Orders dried up overnight.

29:06.166 --> 29:08.685
A few more weeks,
I'd have found the money.

29:08.686 --> 29:10.323
And then this had to happen.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.845
Well, we'll be out of here soon enough.

29:14.846 --> 29:19.697
Now, can anyone verify
what time you got home that night?

29:19.698 --> 29:21.731
We know your daughter's
not living with you.

29:21.732 --> 29:23.507
Have you been speaking to Kayleigh?

29:23.508 --> 29:26.526
We ran into her down at the cafe.

29:27.043 --> 29:29.283
She moved out a couple of months ago.

29:30.567 --> 29:34.006
Bridie can vouch for us. Me wife.

29:34.706 --> 29:36.706
She was putting the youngest to bed.

29:46.166 --> 29:48.165
Some intel's just come through.

29:48.166 --> 29:50.982
You know those recent crimes
in the Peyton area?

29:50.983 --> 29:52.165
Yeah, go on, I'm listening.

29:52.166 --> 29:55.563
Well, there's also a theft
at the Yacht Club, three weeks ago.

29:56.526 --> 29:58.443
- At the Yacht Club?
- Mm-hm.

29:59.166 --> 30:01.947
That's Roy Brewer's watering hole,
isn't it?

30:01.948 --> 30:05.433
Yeah, the manager's car
was broken into. Nita Dajani.

30:05.434 --> 30:07.728
And she gave a description
to the police of the suspect.

30:07.729 --> 30:10.166
Male, late teens, early 20s.

30:11.812 --> 30:13.923
Well, let's see
what else she can tell us.

30:18.458 --> 30:20.625
The car alarm went off
when I was cashing up.

30:20.650 --> 30:22.650
By the time I got out there,
he was running away.

30:23.166 --> 30:25.602
But you did give the police
a description.

30:25.603 --> 30:28.682
- Was this the lad?
- He was wearing a hoodie.

30:28.683 --> 30:31.006
Didn't see his face.

30:32.166 --> 30:34.919
- You say your laptop was stolen?
- Mm-hm.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.603
I only bothered reporting it
to claim on the insurance.

30:38.166 --> 30:40.165
Has this lad been arrested, then?

30:40.166 --> 30:43.166
His body was found in Mincham's boatyard.

30:44.153 --> 30:46.166
I know the yard's been in trouble.

30:46.603 --> 30:48.165
Common knowledge, is it?

30:48.166 --> 30:49.483
Club gossip.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.662
And we know the manner of the lad's death

30:52.663 --> 30:55.588
- has been a source of speculation.
- Hmm.

30:55.613 --> 30:58.031
Last thing we needed was a murder.

30:58.625 --> 31:01.145
I'm sure the lad
didn't ask to be murdered, love.

31:10.539 --> 31:13.538
Opportunistic break-in,
he nicks the laptop,

31:13.539 --> 31:15.378
sells it on to finance his habit.

31:15.379 --> 31:17.539
She barely looked at that photo.

31:18.539 --> 31:21.123
Makes me think she's hiding something.

31:24.539 --> 31:26.539
Oh, not again.

31:27.072 --> 31:29.072
Is he following us?

31:34.059 --> 31:38.538
I've already cautioned you once
about snooping.

31:38.539 --> 31:40.539
I'm just enjoying an afternoon drink.

31:51.539 --> 31:54.538
Night of the murder,
you rang the police at 10:15.

31:54.539 --> 31:56.227
Soon as I got home.

31:56.228 --> 31:59.538
Why not call them straightaway
from outside the yard?

31:59.539 --> 32:01.538
Had your mobile on you.

32:01.539 --> 32:04.149
I suppose I felt safer indoors.

32:04.150 --> 32:06.219
Didn't stop you taking pictures.

32:06.643 --> 32:08.539
I was gathering evidence.

32:09.539 --> 32:12.058
I'm warning you, sunshine,

32:12.059 --> 32:14.539
don't push your luck.

32:24.539 --> 32:27.538
I can see you
in one of them swanky flats.

32:27.539 --> 32:30.243
Oh, yeah? Are you gonna sort me out
with a pay rise?

32:30.899 --> 32:32.539
No chance.

32:34.899 --> 32:37.972
Doesn't look like a town
with a drugs problem, does it?

32:37.973 --> 32:39.539
Urban regeneration.

32:40.123 --> 32:41.538
For those who can afford it.

32:41.539 --> 32:43.538
Mm-hm.

32:43.539 --> 32:47.539
And that tip of a boatyard
is right in the way.

32:48.123 --> 32:50.077
- Kenny?
- 'Ma'am.'

32:50.078 --> 32:51.539
We're at Peyton Links.

32:52.123 --> 32:53.901
We might've found a new lead.

32:53.902 --> 32:56.538
'Eyewitness puts Caden Lennon
down on the beach.'

32:56.539 --> 32:59.538
Right, give us ten minutes,
we'll meet you there.

32:59.539 --> 33:01.539
You'll have to eat that on the way.

33:08.899 --> 33:11.538
A holiday-maker contacted the police.

33:11.539 --> 33:13.997
Her kids were taking lessons
at the surf school.

33:13.998 --> 33:15.330
Said they'd been offered drugs.

33:15.331 --> 33:17.538
Fits the description for Caden Lennon.

33:17.539 --> 33:19.538
Well, what are you doing standing here?

33:19.539 --> 33:21.538
Get someone over to that address!

33:21.539 --> 33:23.787
Let's do a sweep with the photo.

33:23.788 --> 33:26.539
I'll go talk to David Hasselhoff.

33:38.539 --> 33:43.225
A little bird tells me there's been
a bit of drug dealing down here.

33:43.843 --> 33:45.262
Who's told you that?

33:45.263 --> 33:49.263
A parent whose kids were approached
by this fella.

33:52.303 --> 33:54.942
You need to speak to the woman
who made the complaint.

33:54.943 --> 33:57.103
She left her kids in your care.

33:59.263 --> 34:02.262
I might have seen him. Can't be sure.

34:02.263 --> 34:04.263
Beach can get busy this time of year.

34:09.329 --> 34:12.969
This surf school,
it's your business, is it?

34:13.263 --> 34:15.418
Nah. I teach a few lessons
to pay the way.

34:15.418 --> 34:18.263
- So where's home?
- Campervan parked up top.

34:20.962 --> 34:23.962
Saturday night, I hear
there was a bit of a party.

34:24.263 --> 34:26.262
We sank a few beers.

34:26.263 --> 34:29.263
You see Kayleigh Mincham on the beach?

34:30.009 --> 34:31.703
She's always down here with her mates.

34:31.728 --> 34:34.445
Pass off without incident, did it,
this party?

34:34.469 --> 34:38.059
- As far as I know.
- All peace and love, was it?

34:38.083 --> 34:40.083
Just the surf crowd letting off steam.

34:40.109 --> 34:41.797
If that was all,
I've got a class to finish.

34:41.822 --> 34:43.483
How'd you get the fat lip?

34:45.181 --> 34:48.222
Came off the board in the shallows.
Can get pretty rough out there.

34:48.246 --> 34:50.407
Oh, aye.

34:52.069 --> 34:56.069
Go on, then. Go catch some waves.

35:01.989 --> 35:03.029
Come on, guys.

35:13.263 --> 35:15.027
We've got proof of that
from his notebook.

35:15.028 --> 35:18.262
Ma'am, we got a statement
from the woman in Washington.

35:18.263 --> 35:20.815
She has ID'd Caden Lennon
as the lad selling drugs.

35:20.816 --> 35:23.494
Yeah, and we know that he's been
meeting people outside the arcade.

35:23.495 --> 35:25.194
Roy Brewer kept a log in his notebook.

35:25.195 --> 35:27.582
Well, that would have been
a list of his customers.

35:27.583 --> 35:31.302
Beggars Casino, Peyton Links,
Mincham's boatyard.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.462
He certainly gets around.

35:33.463 --> 35:36.422
So how does this new intel
tie in with his murder?

35:36.423 --> 35:38.262
Disgruntled customer, rival dealer?

35:38.263 --> 35:41.000
You can't rule out robbery,
he would have been carrying cash.

35:41.001 --> 35:44.262
The thing is, where's he getting
these drugs in the first place?

35:44.263 --> 35:48.089
Hmm? Up in Peyton? Or here, in Newcastle?

35:48.090 --> 35:49.183
17-year-old lad,

35:49.208 --> 35:51.275
- he's got to be working for someone.
- Right.

35:51.276 --> 35:54.323
We ran that check on
Tony Briggs' employees.

35:54.324 --> 35:56.564
Another one with previous.

35:56.565 --> 35:59.723
Registered addict. Declan Price.

35:59.724 --> 36:03.302
He's currently on probation
with a drug abstinence order.

36:03.303 --> 36:06.943
That's the fellow who was mopping up
the floor in the gents.

36:08.263 --> 36:10.263
Get your coat.

36:19.263 --> 36:20.782
Gotta go, right.

36:20.783 --> 36:23.262
That's all I'm saying,
take care of yourself, yeah?

36:23.263 --> 36:25.263
All right? I've gotta go.

36:27.263 --> 36:29.262
Declan's been clean for months, ma'am.

36:29.263 --> 36:33.262
Yeah, well, he missed his last
meeting with his probation officer.

36:34.635 --> 36:39.155
Mr Price, it's police.
Could you open the door, please?

36:42.635 --> 36:45.634
Mr Price? Can you open the door, love?

36:45.635 --> 36:47.634
Ah.

36:47.635 --> 36:51.634
- DCI Stanhope. Remember me, love?
- Now's not a good time.

36:51.635 --> 36:53.634
- Oh, got company, have you?
- Yeah.

36:53.635 --> 36:57.634
My sister, she's visiting.
Her and a friend.

36:57.635 --> 36:59.635
You don't have a sister, Declan.

37:04.635 --> 37:06.634
Come here! Hey!

37:06.635 --> 37:07.763
No you don't!

37:15.315 --> 37:16.634
What's this?

37:16.635 --> 37:18.203
Eh?

37:31.635 --> 37:33.635
On your feet, the pair of you.

37:35.635 --> 37:37.835
Come on, love, on your feet, yeah?

38:04.635 --> 38:06.635
Ma'am.

38:28.475 --> 38:31.634
These phones look like
they might be burners, ma'am.

38:31.635 --> 38:32.994
Ah, right.

38:32.995 --> 38:34.994
Well, they might give us some leads.

38:34.995 --> 38:38.635
Well, we can take it from here.
You can go.

38:39.635 --> 38:40.843
Ma'am.

39:13.635 --> 39:15.635
Well, well, well.

39:26.868 --> 39:28.868
Recognise this face?

39:30.868 --> 39:32.907
I've never seen him before.

39:32.908 --> 39:35.067
That's funny, that.

39:35.068 --> 39:37.868
His prints are all over your house.

39:40.868 --> 39:44.867
Two grand in cash,
hidden under your fish fingers.

39:44.868 --> 39:47.867
Now, I think this money
is from selling drugs.

39:47.868 --> 39:50.867
I keep all the smack
I can get my hands on.

39:50.868 --> 39:52.867
That's just for personal use.

39:52.868 --> 39:54.867
Oh. Well, what about this business card

39:54.868 --> 39:57.455
you left in the gents
in the Beggars Casino?

39:57.456 --> 40:00.868
'Top gear for sale at knock-down prices.'

40:02.908 --> 40:05.227
I just do as I'm told.

40:05.228 --> 40:06.867
Who by, the boss, Tony Briggs?

40:06.868 --> 40:09.867
Tony? Tony's got nothing to do with this.

40:09.868 --> 40:12.387
Oh, well, then, I'll have to assume

40:12.388 --> 40:14.528
that you're the brains
of this enterprise.

40:14.529 --> 40:16.547
And that Caden Lennon
was working for you.

40:16.548 --> 40:17.867
You've broken the terms of your parole.

40:17.868 --> 40:21.867
You're looking at
a custodial sentence, sunshine.

40:23.868 --> 40:27.563
I... I don't know.

40:29.648 --> 40:31.648
A friend introduced us.

40:31.673 --> 40:33.843
He said the lad needed a place to stay.

40:33.868 --> 40:36.868
So which friend was this?

40:37.868 --> 40:39.231
I can't say.

40:39.232 --> 40:41.163
You could've said no.

40:43.868 --> 40:47.867
Caden said they'd hurt us
if I went to the police.

40:47.868 --> 40:49.868
Who's "they"?

41:00.695 --> 41:02.695
Th-they never...

41:02.720 --> 41:05.920
They never showed their faces
round Peyton.

41:05.945 --> 41:08.585
They left all the legwork to Caden.

41:10.514 --> 41:12.514
So can you give us any names?

41:12.868 --> 41:14.867
People he talked to?

41:14.868 --> 41:17.163
All that smack, it makes you forgetful.

41:18.181 --> 41:23.387
Well, can you remember
where you were on Saturday evening?

41:23.388 --> 41:25.867
I was working at the arcade.

41:25.868 --> 41:27.867
I didn't get off till ten.

41:27.868 --> 41:31.867
See Caden dealing there?
We know that's his patch.

41:31.868 --> 41:34.495
Last time I saw him
was back at the house.

41:34.496 --> 41:36.202
And what time was this?

41:36.203 --> 41:37.907
Late afternoon.

41:37.908 --> 41:40.489
He'd just got off a train
with a load of fresh gear.

41:40.490 --> 41:42.316
And how'd he seem?

41:42.317 --> 41:45.370
Bit on edge.
I went into my room to shoot up.

41:45.371 --> 41:47.868
By the time I left for work...

41:48.648 --> 41:51.008
...there was no sign of him.

41:51.033 --> 41:52.673
And you don't recall anyone else
dropping by?

41:55.595 --> 41:58.595
I might have heard some people talking.

41:58.868 --> 42:02.068
Bit of a kick-off,
from the sound of things.

42:03.454 --> 42:06.203
So he's with... who?

42:14.868 --> 42:18.867
like I said, I was out of it.

42:18.868 --> 42:20.907
I... I...

42:20.908 --> 42:23.163
I really need to see a doctor.

42:40.228 --> 42:42.124
Ma'am, you might wanna
take a look at this.

42:42.125 --> 42:44.111
- What?
- Intel from the gangs unit.

42:44.112 --> 42:46.867
"Caden Lennon was running drugs
for a county line,

42:46.868 --> 42:49.773
"maintained and protected at any cost."

42:49.774 --> 42:51.867
Perfect profile for gang recruitment.

42:51.868 --> 42:53.867
Care home kid, no record.

42:53.868 --> 42:55.867
Yeah, much less likely to
draw attention to himself.

42:55.868 --> 42:57.867
Maybe he did draw attention to himself,

42:57.868 --> 42:59.495
maybe that's what got him killed.

42:59.496 --> 43:01.569
Up and down on a train
with a pocket full of drugs.

43:01.570 --> 43:03.867
And we know Declan Price was
a victim of cuckooing.

43:03.868 --> 43:05.867
Vulnerable addict,

43:05.868 --> 43:07.867
they take over his home
and use it as a stash house.

43:07.868 --> 43:11.318
Now, here's some intel on a gang
called Ferry Boys.

43:11.319 --> 43:14.199
Now, are they the ones
who set him up in Peyton?

43:14.200 --> 43:16.619
Are they the ones
pulling the strings here?

43:16.620 --> 43:18.867
We've tracked down the signal
on that mobile.

43:18.868 --> 43:20.868
NE6 postcode.

43:21.868 --> 43:23.868
That's the Ferry Cross estate.

43:24.908 --> 43:29.867
Get onto the NCA, I want
anything they've got on that gang.

43:29.868 --> 43:31.363
Ma'am.

43:31.868 --> 43:34.867
Can you put me in touch with
the right person at the NCA?

43:34.868 --> 43:37.867
We've made enquiries on the estate.

43:37.868 --> 43:41.868
Anyone wants me, I'll be in the mortuary.

44:17.388 --> 44:19.548
He insisted on coming.
He wanted to see him.

44:35.868 --> 44:37.149
Where'll they bury him?

44:37.150 --> 44:41.387
I imagine there'll be
a public health cremation, love.

44:41.388 --> 44:42.867
Just as soon as we've released the body.

44:42.868 --> 44:46.707
There needs to be a...
a stone or something.

44:46.708 --> 44:48.867
A proper grave with his name on it.

44:48.868 --> 44:52.867
Well, we could perhaps try to locate
your dad, see if he could...

44:52.868 --> 44:55.867
- I don't want him there.
- All right.

44:55.868 --> 44:57.868
He threw me brother down the stairs once.

44:58.243 --> 44:59.867
Broke his arm.

44:59.868 --> 45:01.868
- Your dad?
- Aye.

45:02.243 --> 45:04.243
He was all set to give us a hiding.

45:05.221 --> 45:07.221
Caden got between us.

45:08.868 --> 45:09.868
He always looked out for me.

45:15.368 --> 45:20.368
Tyler, I think he got in with a gang
on that estate.

45:20.393 --> 45:21.393
And he was dealing.

45:21.418 --> 45:24.418
Now, these friends of his,

45:24.443 --> 45:27.443
they're not the sort of people
you wanna mess with, love.

45:27.868 --> 45:31.868
So maybe he was still
looking out for you.

45:42.562 --> 45:44.292
Yeah, we're on our way back now.

45:44.317 --> 45:46.267
Everything OK there?

46:02.868 --> 46:05.613
I've been working through
those burner phones, ma'am.

46:05.614 --> 46:07.272
Nothing that links us to the Ferry Cross,

46:07.273 --> 46:11.094
but Caden did receive three calls,
evening he was killed.

46:11.095 --> 46:13.614
Phone number's registered to
Kayleigh Mincham.

46:16.460 --> 46:18.460
- Thanks.
- Thank you. See you later, love.

46:24.487 --> 46:28.487
I think it's time we got
a few things straight, don't you?

46:32.493 --> 46:34.493
I was always gonna hand over
those phones.

46:35.643 --> 46:37.614
I'm not sure I believe you.

46:39.614 --> 46:42.614
If you've been covering for
Kayleigh Mincham...

46:46.614 --> 46:49.330
Let me guess. You're mates with her dad?

46:49.355 --> 46:51.125
Me and Gary go back a bit, yeah.

46:51.150 --> 46:53.060
Something else you failed to mention.

46:53.085 --> 46:54.405
I didn't think it was relevant.

46:54.614 --> 46:57.613
But it was you who found the body
in his boatyard!

46:57.614 --> 46:59.614
And I did everything by the book.

47:01.480 --> 47:04.480
That search of Declan Price's place,

47:05.043 --> 47:06.980
did you call Kayleigh?

47:06.981 --> 47:08.613
Warn her we were coming?

47:08.614 --> 47:10.613
Er... no.

47:10.614 --> 47:12.613
You were on the phone to someone.

47:12.614 --> 47:15.614
I was just checking in with the station.

47:17.507 --> 47:19.963
You knew that lass was involved.

47:20.974 --> 47:23.803
You'd better start sharing, sunshine.

47:25.614 --> 47:27.614
Look, Kayleigh Mincham's an addict.

47:28.043 --> 47:30.614
She's been using for a while now, heroin.

47:31.614 --> 47:33.613
That family's been through enough.

47:33.614 --> 47:36.613
So you thought you'd interfere
with a murder enquiry?

47:36.614 --> 47:38.454
I was just looking out for her.

47:39.333 --> 47:42.333
Look, if this goes any further,
the professional standards...

47:42.614 --> 47:44.453
I'm looking at a desk job.

47:47.134 --> 47:50.613
Kayleigh Mincham is now
a person of interest,

47:50.614 --> 47:52.002
and whilst this case is ongoing,

47:52.003 --> 47:54.184
you'll have nothing more to do with her.

47:54.185 --> 47:56.614
- Yes, ma'am.
- And you'll talk to no one!

47:57.003 --> 48:00.290
Not to witnesses, or suspects,
or to any of my team.

48:00.291 --> 48:02.453
And you don't talk to me, come to that,

48:02.454 --> 48:04.396
- unless I address you first.
- But I...

48:04.397 --> 48:08.613
And if I find your actions have
compromised this investigation,

48:08.614 --> 48:13.974
well, a desk job is gonna be
the least of your bloody worries!

48:20.974 --> 48:23.364
DCI Stanhope.

48:23.365 --> 48:24.613
Gary's over at the yard.

48:24.614 --> 48:26.614
Well, it's Kayleigh
we're looking for, love.

48:27.614 --> 48:32.453
We need to talk to her in connection
with the murder of Caden Lennon.

48:32.454 --> 48:35.613
She spoke to him three times
on the night he was killed.

48:35.614 --> 48:37.003
Drug dealer.

48:38.746 --> 48:40.786
We'd better talk outside.

48:43.134 --> 48:44.614
Chloe found the stuff in her bag.

48:45.614 --> 48:47.614
Suddenly it all made sense.

48:49.294 --> 48:51.613
Gary hit the roof,
told her to pack her bags.

48:51.614 --> 48:53.813
You didn't know where Kayleigh
was getting the drugs?

48:53.814 --> 48:56.613
Some lad she got friendly with.
They weren't from round here.

48:56.614 --> 48:59.293
That must've been very hard for you.

48:59.294 --> 49:01.293
Gary won't even talk about it.

49:01.294 --> 49:03.614
The one person
that might make her see sense.

49:05.614 --> 49:08.963
- That night the lad was murdered...
- Sean rang.

49:09.454 --> 49:11.083
PC Turnley.

49:11.614 --> 49:13.614
Told us they'd found a body.

49:15.614 --> 49:17.613
I thought, for a moment...

49:17.614 --> 49:19.654
You thought it might've been Kayleigh.

49:20.523 --> 49:22.613
When we found out
there might've been drugs involved,

49:22.614 --> 49:24.614
I asked Sean to keep Kayleigh out of it.

49:25.163 --> 49:28.453
You took advantage of
his better nature, love.

49:28.454 --> 49:30.613
Kayleigh had nothing to do with this.

49:30.614 --> 49:33.083
She's been trying to get clean.

49:34.203 --> 49:36.614
We'd even talked about
her going to rehab.

49:37.614 --> 49:40.614
So you've been seeing Kayleigh...

49:41.614 --> 49:43.613
...behind your husband's back.

49:43.614 --> 49:44.963
She's my child!

49:45.614 --> 49:47.454
I couldn't just write her off.

49:48.380 --> 49:52.363
We need to talk to Kayleigh, love.
Find out where she is.

49:53.940 --> 49:56.420
That is, if you do want to help her.

49:58.614 --> 50:00.483
We own a beach hut.

50:01.614 --> 50:02.923
Lower Headley Cliffs.

50:04.614 --> 50:06.614
Used to rent it out for the summer.

50:18.614 --> 50:19.843
Kayleigh?

50:28.346 --> 50:31.346
Someone's definitely been dossing
down in here.

50:31.614 --> 50:34.614
Aye. More than one person,
by the look of it.

50:35.083 --> 50:37.613
So much for her getting clean.

50:54.093 --> 50:55.253
No!

50:57.614 --> 51:01.613
- Come on in.
- No way. It's freezing.

51:20.479 --> 51:22.638
The lad's only 15 years old.

51:22.639 --> 51:24.638
You didn't think
someone might be looking for him?

51:24.639 --> 51:26.638
He turned up last night.

51:26.639 --> 51:28.679
Said he needed somewhere to stay.

51:29.443 --> 51:32.639
Oh, so you must know Tyler
pretty well, then?

51:33.839 --> 51:37.275
He came up to Peyton a few times.
Wanted to see his brother.

51:37.276 --> 51:40.433
Ah, right. Yes, the dealer.

51:40.433 --> 51:43.408
You phoned three times
on the day he was murdered.

51:46.408 --> 51:48.408
Who was he working for?

51:48.763 --> 51:50.487
I didn't care, didn't ask.

51:50.488 --> 51:53.803
- Just as long as you were sorted?
- I do drugs now and then.

51:54.928 --> 51:56.407
So what?

51:56.408 --> 51:59.407
And you can stop
whenever you want to, can you, love?

51:59.408 --> 52:02.247
I've heard that one before.

52:02.248 --> 52:05.407
So take me through your movements
on Saturday evening.

52:05.408 --> 52:07.408
I've already told you.

52:08.408 --> 52:10.407
Well, I'd like you to tell me again.

52:10.408 --> 52:13.683
- I'd ordered some gear for the party.
- Mm-hm.

52:18.208 --> 52:20.208
I'd arranged to meet Caden
down at the Links.

52:20.843 --> 52:23.408
Now we're getting somewhere.

52:24.408 --> 52:26.408
Now, what time was this?

52:27.408 --> 52:31.148
Straight after work.
Must've been around seven.

52:31.149 --> 52:33.861
Are you sure Caden didn't go
to this party with you?

52:33.862 --> 52:35.608
That was the last time I saw him.

52:36.243 --> 52:39.407
So where'd you spend
the rest of the night? Hmm?

52:39.408 --> 52:42.407
You told us you didn't go back home,
you went straight to work.

52:42.408 --> 52:45.087
I got high. I passed out on the beach.

52:45.088 --> 52:46.407
I don't remember much of it.

52:46.408 --> 52:49.247
And you just woke up in the morning

52:49.248 --> 52:51.763
and heard this lad had been murdered?

52:56.248 --> 52:58.248
Roy gave us the news
when I got to the caff.

53:12.408 --> 53:14.407
Are you letting us go, then?

53:14.408 --> 53:17.407
Oh, no, I'll need a statement
from you first, pet.

53:19.408 --> 53:22.407
But if I find you've been lying to me,

53:22.408 --> 53:26.408
I'll have you straight back in here
and up on a charge.

53:33.768 --> 53:36.407
We've arranged to put him up
in temporary accommodation. Good.

53:36.408 --> 53:38.407
You think he might be in danger?

53:38.408 --> 53:40.403
It's better to be safe than sorry.

53:41.248 --> 53:44.407
His brother's death might've been
gang-related.

53:44.408 --> 53:46.899
Now, I suggest you confiscate his mobile

53:46.900 --> 53:49.119
and make sure he doesn't talk to anyone.

53:49.120 --> 53:50.407
Tyler doesn't know anything.

53:50.408 --> 53:52.113
- I need a word with the DCI.
- No.

53:52.114 --> 53:54.644
- Just five minutes.
- You've got two minutes.

53:54.645 --> 53:57.408
And counting. Better make it quick.

53:58.408 --> 54:00.407
I hear you spoke to Nita Dajani.

54:00.408 --> 54:02.407
Well, that's no longer
your concern, love.

54:02.408 --> 54:05.407
No, it's just I was the officer
who responded to the break in,

54:05.408 --> 54:07.408
and she seemed like
she was hiding something.

54:07.883 --> 54:09.407
Why do you say that?

54:09.408 --> 54:12.407
Well, she was pretty shaken up
by the time I got to the club.

54:12.408 --> 54:16.407
Her car window was smashed in.
She wanted this lad apprehended.

54:16.408 --> 54:19.407
A couple of days later,
I paid her a follow-up,

54:19.408 --> 54:21.523
she said she decided to
drop the whole thing.

54:22.408 --> 54:25.403
I think... maybe someone leaned on her.

54:28.408 --> 54:29.928
Hmm.

54:43.408 --> 54:45.407
I thought I'd answered
all your questions.

54:45.408 --> 54:47.408
Well, I've got a few more, love.

54:49.088 --> 54:50.408
This way.

54:50.963 --> 54:53.407
This lad who broke into your vehicle...

54:53.408 --> 54:57.063
- Like I said, I barely saw him.
- Yeah, that's not gonna wash, love.

54:57.064 --> 55:00.927
You did recognise Caden Lennon
when we showed you that photograph.

55:00.928 --> 55:03.408
The question is, why'd you lie to us?

55:05.408 --> 55:06.767
We didn't want any more trouble.

55:06.768 --> 55:10.963
Well, obstructing a murder enquiry,
love, is asking for trouble.

55:12.008 --> 55:15.883
So why don't you tell us
what did happen that night?

55:17.408 --> 55:19.408
They came in for a drink.

55:19.883 --> 55:21.408
There were four of them.

55:21.923 --> 55:24.643
Walked up to the bar
like they owned the place.

55:25.248 --> 55:27.407
I told them politely it was members only.

55:27.408 --> 55:31.408
- Asked them to leave.
- And how did that go down?

55:31.843 --> 55:34.407
One of them threatened to mark me.

55:34.408 --> 55:36.247
Said I needed to learn some respect.

55:36.248 --> 55:37.767
Was that Caden Lennon?

55:37.768 --> 55:40.408
No, this fella was older.

55:40.803 --> 55:42.408
Clearly he was calling the shots.

55:43.203 --> 55:45.968
I said I'd call the police
if he didn't leave.

55:45.969 --> 55:49.407
Finally, they got the message.
Drove off in a 4x4.

55:49.408 --> 55:51.407
Did you get a look at the plates?

55:51.408 --> 55:53.408
I was just glad to see the back of him.

55:55.408 --> 55:58.407
So, later that night,
this fella sends his lackey back.

55:58.408 --> 56:00.407
This is after you've closed.

56:00.408 --> 56:03.407
Smashes the car window to make a point.

56:03.408 --> 56:05.843
Police came, I gave them a statement.

56:07.141 --> 56:10.323
In the cold light of day, I just
didn't think it was worth pursuing.

56:12.088 --> 56:16.407
Look, I understand why you were
having second thoughts, love.

56:16.408 --> 56:18.043
I get that. I get it.

56:19.035 --> 56:21.014
But then you hear
the lad's been murdered,

56:21.015 --> 56:23.408
and still you don't come forward.

56:25.408 --> 56:27.408
I suppose I was scared.

56:30.274 --> 56:32.274
"We didn't want any more trouble,"
you said.

56:32.299 --> 56:36.299
That suggests you weren't alone
when the lad came back.

56:41.041 --> 56:43.721
And I'm guessing it wasn't a lock-in.

56:48.088 --> 56:50.407
Aye, I warned her
to drop the whole thing.

56:50.408 --> 56:51.846
Thought it best if the police
weren't involved.

56:51.847 --> 56:55.197
- Told her you'd sort it yourself?
- What's that supposed to mean?

56:55.198 --> 56:57.407
A group of thugs threaten
your girlfriend...

56:57.408 --> 56:58.408
She's not me girlfriend.

56:58.409 --> 57:01.407
And one of them comes back
after hours, smashes up her car,

57:01.408 --> 57:05.407
and that same lad's found murdered
in the boatyard where you work.

57:05.408 --> 57:08.408
Well, you can see how it looks.

57:10.200 --> 57:13.407
OK, I should've come forward
when they found the body.

57:13.408 --> 57:15.927
That's the first sensible thing
you've said.

57:15.928 --> 57:19.087
Me and Nita, I didn't want Gary to know.

57:19.088 --> 57:20.927
That you were working for
the competition?

57:20.928 --> 57:23.247
They're opening a franchise
for yacht repairs.

57:23.248 --> 57:24.407
I give her the heads up on a few orders.

57:24.408 --> 57:28.407
You gave her everything she needed
to finish Gary's business.

57:28.408 --> 57:31.927
The yard was already finished!
Only Gary couldn't see that.

57:31.928 --> 57:35.603
So what you get out of it?
Apart from the obvious.

57:37.156 --> 57:39.408
She's promised us a job,
when we're up and running.

57:39.816 --> 57:41.701
I had my future to think about!

57:41.702 --> 57:44.408
Yeah, well, I hope it was worth it, love.

57:45.523 --> 57:47.768
I really do!

57:52.408 --> 57:55.770
We need an ANPR check to find that 4x4.

57:55.771 --> 58:00.407
In fact, any vehicle in the area
the night of that break-in.

58:00.408 --> 58:03.407
We've got NCA intel on this gang,
the Ferry Boys.

58:03.408 --> 58:05.447
They're in the frame for
a few recent muggings,

58:05.448 --> 58:07.407
smash and grabs, stolen phones.

58:07.408 --> 58:10.407
Yeah, well, we're looking for
the kingpins, not kids on bikes.

58:10.408 --> 58:12.681
Recently implicated in an acid attack.

58:12.682 --> 58:16.407
Rival gang member. It's their method
of dealing with any competition.

58:16.408 --> 58:18.408
An acid attack.

58:20.094 --> 58:22.923
I think we need another chat
with Tony Briggs.

58:50.408 --> 58:52.408
This is starting to look like harassment.

58:54.408 --> 58:58.408
You didn't decide to
give up drug dealing, love.

58:59.408 --> 59:01.920
You were forced out by rival dealers,

59:01.921 --> 59:04.407
Newcastle gang
who'd set up a county line.

59:04.408 --> 59:07.407
You think I'd feel threatened
by a gang of kids?

59:07.408 --> 59:10.035
Oh, I think it was
more than threats, love,

59:10.036 --> 59:12.408
by the look of them scars on your arm.

59:14.608 --> 59:18.447
Check up on his hospital records,
see what they can tell us.

59:18.448 --> 59:21.407
Back in my day,
the dealers had standards.

59:21.408 --> 59:24.162
You'd look after your clients.
There was loyalty.

59:24.163 --> 59:27.407
Oh, proper gents, I'll bet

59:27.408 --> 59:32.407
These inner-city dealers,
they'd kill you in a heartbeat

59:32.408 --> 59:35.087
to protect their racket.
There's too much money at stake.

59:35.088 --> 59:38.407
Make a complaint. We can have
whoever did this arrested.

59:38.408 --> 59:41.034
Next time, it'll be the face.

59:41.035 --> 59:43.407
Declan Price's house.

59:43.408 --> 59:45.407
You must've known they'd moved in there.

59:45.408 --> 59:48.768
I knew he was scared.
He'd seen too many faces.

59:49.323 --> 59:51.407
Now, if you'd been attacked,

59:51.408 --> 59:54.408
you'd be looking for payback,
wouldn't you?

59:54.843 --> 59:57.407
Name Caden Lennon ring any bells?

59:57.408 --> 01:00:01.087
And there I was, thinking you were
concerned about my well-being.

01:00:01.088 --> 01:00:03.763
Puts you in the frame for his murder.

01:00:04.408 --> 01:00:06.407
I was working here on Saturday night.

01:00:06.408 --> 01:00:08.608
With your old mate Declan?

01:00:08.963 --> 01:00:11.408
He turned up to work. He wasn't well.

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:15.088
Said he couldn't take much more
of Caden's bullying.

01:00:15.523 --> 01:00:18.723
I sent him home early. No use to anybody.

01:00:22.088 --> 01:00:24.247
Mr Price?

01:00:24.248 --> 01:00:25.928
It's police.

01:00:27.928 --> 01:00:29.408
Mr Price?

01:00:31.768 --> 01:00:34.408
Get that door open.

01:00:57.313 --> 01:01:01.312
Respiratory failure
as a result of opioid ingestion.

01:01:01.313 --> 01:01:05.313
Chronic emphysema
from long-term drug abuse.

01:01:06.313 --> 01:01:09.312
He would have been predisposed,
it was only a matter of time.

01:01:09.313 --> 01:01:11.312
So an accidental overdose?

01:01:11.313 --> 01:01:14.992
Well, it certainly looked like it,
till I did some more tests.

01:01:14.993 --> 01:01:17.672
The heroin was cut with fentanyl,

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:21.312
an opioid 75 times stronger
than morphine.

01:01:21.313 --> 01:01:25.312
I sent a sample down to the lab
for chromatographic analysis

01:01:25.313 --> 01:01:28.313
and it would've been a lethal dose.

01:01:29.313 --> 01:01:32.029
So whoever supplied this heroin

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:33.312
would've known that it would kill him?

01:01:33.313 --> 01:01:35.313
This was murder.

01:01:37.313 --> 01:01:40.889
Declan Price's death
is now being treated as murder.

01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:43.312
A lethal batch of dirty heroin.

01:01:43.313 --> 01:01:46.040
So we're ruling out Declan
as Caden Lennon's killer?

01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:48.728
Declan Price didn't kill that lad.

01:01:49.363 --> 01:01:51.513
Though he might've known who did.

01:01:53.353 --> 01:01:55.513
Pushed him too hard.

01:01:56.973 --> 01:01:58.973
Another needless death.

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:07.980
If we are to assume that
these two murders are connected,

01:02:08.107 --> 01:02:09.787
would it put Alan White in the clear?

01:02:09.906 --> 01:02:14.266
Not necessarily.
It keeps coming back to this gang.

01:02:14.291 --> 01:02:18.251
They threatened Dajani,
assaulted Tony Briggs.

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:21.476
So, did Caden Lennon do something
to make them turn on him?

01:02:21.513 --> 01:02:24.964
I ran a routine search
on Declan Price's finances, ma'am.

01:02:24.965 --> 01:02:26.992
Something doesn't add up.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:29.312
Large amounts of cash have
passed through his bank account.

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:31.312
Regular deposits and withdrawals.

01:02:31.313 --> 01:02:35.312
There's a few thousand a week,
for a fella on benefits.

01:02:35.313 --> 01:02:37.312
A withdrawal was made in Peyton
this morning.

01:02:37.313 --> 01:02:39.312
£500 with his cashpoint card.

01:02:39.313 --> 01:02:41.312
Well, that would have been
a walking miracle.

01:02:41.313 --> 01:02:43.312
They've sent me footage
from the ATM camera.

01:02:43.313 --> 01:02:45.313
Let's have a look.

01:02:49.313 --> 01:02:50.963
Freeze it.

01:02:52.673 --> 01:02:54.163
Kayleigh Mincham.

01:02:56.313 --> 01:02:59.512
Declan Price's bank card,
found in your pocket.

01:02:59.513 --> 01:03:01.353
Care to explain?

01:03:02.043 --> 01:03:04.312
I need it to pay for a deal.

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:05.950
Asked us to get some cash out.

01:03:05.951 --> 01:03:07.483
Didn't know you were friends.

01:03:08.313 --> 01:03:09.353
Now you do.

01:03:10.163 --> 01:03:12.312
He give you his pin number, did he?

01:03:12.313 --> 01:03:14.312
You can ask him yourself
if you don't believe us.

01:03:14.313 --> 01:03:16.312
Ah, that might prove tricky, love.

01:03:16.313 --> 01:03:20.352
Because Declan was found murdered
last night, needle in his arm.

01:03:20.353 --> 01:03:22.832
Someone had spiked his heroin.

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:26.312
And then this morning,
you are caught on camera

01:03:26.313 --> 01:03:29.312
stealing 500 quid
from a dead man's account.

01:03:29.313 --> 01:03:31.312
It wasn't even his money!

01:03:31.313 --> 01:03:33.662
I'm inclined to believe you there, pet.

01:03:33.663 --> 01:03:38.152
Cos someone else was using Declan's
bank account to hide drugs money.

01:03:38.153 --> 01:03:41.312
I swear, I had nothing to do with it.

01:03:41.313 --> 01:03:45.312
No? Well, I think it was you
who set Caden up in Peyton.

01:03:45.313 --> 01:03:50.152
It was you introduced him to Declan,
got him into his house

01:03:50.153 --> 01:03:52.783
because you knew
Declan was an easy target!

01:03:52.784 --> 01:03:55.312
I never thought they'd hurt him.

01:03:55.313 --> 01:03:58.313
Well, both those people
are now dead, love.

01:04:00.313 --> 01:04:04.312
And sooner or later, you're gonna be
surplus to requirements.

01:04:04.313 --> 01:04:06.643
And what's gonna happen then, eh?

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:14.312
Just give us the name of whoever
is running this county line.

01:04:14.313 --> 01:04:16.313
Who's pulling the strings?

01:04:17.323 --> 01:04:19.313
They're the ones we're after.

01:04:21.313 --> 01:04:23.312
I can't.

01:04:23.313 --> 01:04:25.832
I can't!

01:04:25.833 --> 01:04:29.312
We talked to several witnesses
who attended that party.

01:04:29.313 --> 01:04:33.312
And no one can remember seeing you
after 10 PM that evening.

01:04:33.313 --> 01:04:35.352
I told you, I passed out on the beach.

01:04:35.353 --> 01:04:38.672
- Well, I don't believe you.
- I did, I swear.

01:04:38.673 --> 01:04:42.313
I woke up on Sunday morning
in Lee Nadella's camper van.

01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:46.512
I found her lying on the beach
at the party.

01:04:46.513 --> 01:04:48.313
Off her face, as usual.

01:04:49.173 --> 01:04:51.173
I couldn't just leave her there.

01:04:51.833 --> 01:04:53.661
Nothing happened.

01:04:53.662 --> 01:04:56.313
Did you know
Caden Lennon supplied her heroin?

01:04:58.313 --> 01:05:01.596
I told her he was bad news.
Not that she took any notice.

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:04.312
So you lied, when you said
you didn't know him.

01:05:04.313 --> 01:05:05.929
I didn't wanna drop Kayleigh in it.

01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:07.723
Sounds like you've got a soft spot.

01:05:11.313 --> 01:05:13.313
She had everything going for her.

01:05:14.123 --> 01:05:16.312
And she's just thrown her life away.

01:05:16.313 --> 01:05:19.312
You clock Kayleigh on the beach
with Caden.

01:05:19.313 --> 01:05:24.024
She's desperate for a fix and he's
the lad supplying her with drugs.

01:05:24.025 --> 01:05:26.913
So what happened, you get between them?

01:05:26.914 --> 01:05:28.672
I warned him off, that's all.

01:05:28.673 --> 01:05:31.312
Got into a fight,
by the look of that lip.

01:05:31.313 --> 01:05:33.632
And you told us you'd been drinking.

01:05:33.633 --> 01:05:35.923
OK, so he took a pop at us.

01:05:36.146 --> 01:05:39.146
- Threw a punch and ran.
- And you went after him, did you?

01:05:39.313 --> 01:05:41.723
Hmm? Decide to teach him a lesson?

01:05:45.313 --> 01:05:46.833
You seriously think I killed him?

01:05:47.203 --> 01:05:51.313
I think we should finish this
back at the station. Come on, son.

01:06:05.313 --> 01:06:08.152
We've arrested Lee Nadella for murder.

01:06:08.153 --> 01:06:09.914
We know about the fight on the beach.

01:06:09.915 --> 01:06:12.312
Lee didn't kill anyone.

01:06:12.313 --> 01:06:14.312
He hasn't got it in him.

01:06:14.313 --> 01:06:16.313
Well, unless you can tell me who did...

01:06:22.313 --> 01:06:26.992
Look, this 'couldn't care less' act
is not gonna wash, love.

01:06:26.993 --> 01:06:29.313
You're out of your depth and you know it.

01:06:32.013 --> 01:06:37.173
This fella doesn't need protecting,
he doesn't deserve protecting.

01:06:44.313 --> 01:06:47.313
He shows up in Peyton
when he feels like it.

01:06:49.313 --> 01:06:51.313
Likes to surprise us, he says.

01:06:53.313 --> 01:06:56.313
And did he show up in Peyton last night?

01:06:58.313 --> 01:07:00.313
Went for a drive, that's all.

01:07:03.313 --> 01:07:04.739
Did he buy you that chain?

01:07:10.313 --> 01:07:12.313
So what if he did?

01:07:14.313 --> 01:07:19.313
Kayleigh, I'm going to need a name.

01:07:31.153 --> 01:07:32.352
Result!

01:07:32.353 --> 01:07:35.841
We're looking for a fella
called Nathaniel Halpin,

01:07:35.842 --> 01:07:38.312
H-A-L-P-I-N.

01:07:38.313 --> 01:07:40.312
His friends call him Nat.

01:07:40.313 --> 01:07:41.895
He's the leader of this gang

01:07:41.896 --> 01:07:44.312
and by all accounts,
he's a piece of work.

01:07:44.313 --> 01:07:46.832
Now, Kayleigh Mincham can place him
in Peyton

01:07:46.833 --> 01:07:48.684
at the time of both murders.

01:07:48.685 --> 01:07:51.070
Ma'am, here you are. He's got previous,

01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:54.312
ABH and possession of a knife,
18 months ago.

01:07:54.313 --> 01:07:56.312
We've got him.

01:07:56.313 --> 01:07:57.910
Kenny, I'll need an address.

01:07:57.911 --> 01:08:02.174
Get onto DVLA.
I'm guessing he drives a 4x4.

01:08:02.175 --> 01:08:04.115
- Ma'am.
- Anyone wants me,

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.352
I'll be with Dave Miller.

01:08:05.353 --> 01:08:07.513
Let's see if we can jog his memory.

01:08:14.313 --> 01:08:16.152
Yeah, I know him.

01:08:16.153 --> 01:08:18.312
Kicked him out the centre
for carrying a weapon.

01:08:18.313 --> 01:08:21.312
- Nat knows he's not welcome.
- So he doesn't live on this estate?

01:08:21.313 --> 01:08:23.312
Not any more.

01:08:23.313 --> 01:08:24.832
I hear he's got a plush pad in Jesmond.

01:08:24.832 --> 01:08:28.313
Yeah? Well, what about his gang,
the Ferry Boys?

01:08:32.313 --> 01:08:35.312
Look, if anyone round here
knew I was talking to the police...

01:08:35.313 --> 01:08:38.145
Nat Halpin is a prime suspect
in Caden's murder.

01:08:38.145 --> 01:08:41.078
Coerced him into pushing drugs.

01:08:41.103 --> 01:08:43.337
And we know the source
is from this estate.

01:08:44.313 --> 01:08:47.313
I have spent five years looking out
for these kids.

01:08:47.643 --> 01:08:49.312
I would've done something about it.

01:08:49.313 --> 01:08:51.352
Well, maybe you still can, love.

01:08:51.353 --> 01:08:54.312
Whatever you may think about the police,

01:08:54.313 --> 01:08:56.312
I want this fella locked up.

01:08:56.313 --> 01:08:59.312
Before he finds another lad
to take Caden's place.

01:08:59.313 --> 01:09:01.313
Now, do you want that on your conscience?

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:15.312
One of his crew serves up from the flat.

01:09:15.313 --> 01:09:17.313
Which flat?

01:09:18.832 --> 01:09:20.313
Back of the tower block.

01:09:21.313 --> 01:09:23.082
Number.

01:09:24.313 --> 01:09:26.312
Police! Stay where you are!

01:09:31.113 --> 01:09:33.113
Police!

01:09:34.353 --> 01:09:36.513
All clear.

01:10:05.513 --> 01:10:08.992
It's still warm.

01:10:13.313 --> 01:10:15.672
Ma'am, we're in Jesmond.

01:10:15.673 --> 01:10:20.312
Nat Halpin appears to have
gone to ground, ma'am.

01:10:37.313 --> 01:10:40.312
Ma'am, forensics are testing
the drugs we found at the flat

01:10:40.313 --> 01:10:41.672
for a chemical signature.

01:10:41.673 --> 01:10:45.312
Well, we need a match to this stash
seized in Peyton.

01:10:45.313 --> 01:10:49.312
Some evidence
to tie him to these murders.

01:10:49.313 --> 01:10:52.313
Come on, Jack, find us something,
anything we can work with.

01:10:58.353 --> 01:11:00.832
At least we've closed down
their supply line.

01:11:00.833 --> 01:11:04.499
They start up somewhere else,
find some other kids to exploit. What?

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.312
That search we ran
on Kayleigh Mincham's mobile.

01:11:07.313 --> 01:11:09.312
There was nothing on it, was there?

01:11:09.313 --> 01:11:11.672
Well, we got access to
her social media accounts.

01:11:11.673 --> 01:11:14.312
You might wanna take a look
at these selfies we found

01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:15.313
in her direct messages,

01:11:15.314 --> 01:11:18.083
I think that's what you call
bragging rights.

01:11:22.313 --> 01:11:25.312
You weren't headed up to Peyton
to see your brother.

01:11:25.313 --> 01:11:28.353
He was dropping off drugs
for this county line.

01:11:28.883 --> 01:11:31.076
- Tyler!
- I've got nothing to say to you.

01:11:31.077 --> 01:11:34.312
Oh, get that attitude
from Nat Halpin, did you?

01:11:34.313 --> 01:11:38.883
The fella you were working for
got previous for carrying a knife.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.080
Now, had your brother
fallen out with him?

01:11:44.105 --> 01:11:47.105
Nat was family. He's blood!

01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:51.130
Nat Halpin isn't family, whatever
promises he might've made you.

01:11:51.155 --> 01:11:52.288
Now then,

01:11:52.313 --> 01:11:56.512
we know that he was up in Peyton
the night that Caden died.

01:11:56.513 --> 01:12:00.312
And I think he went up there to kill him.

01:12:00.313 --> 01:12:02.312
I told you, I don't know anything.

01:12:02.313 --> 01:12:06.313
Tyler, you're the one person
your brother would've confided in.

01:12:13.313 --> 01:12:15.312
Do you know what they do to a grass?

01:12:15.313 --> 01:12:19.312
Well, if you're worried about reprisals,

01:12:19.313 --> 01:12:21.313
we'll take care of you.

01:12:22.313 --> 01:12:24.313
- Witness protection?
- Aye.

01:12:25.313 --> 01:12:27.353
I'd rather take me chances.

01:12:36.163 --> 01:12:38.778
She'll be in court
first thing in the morning.

01:12:38.779 --> 01:12:40.124
Then what?

01:12:40.125 --> 01:12:43.313
Well, I imagine she'll be bailed,
pending charges.

01:12:50.313 --> 01:12:53.672
Mr Mincham, your daughter
can come back from this,

01:12:53.673 --> 01:12:55.673
but she will need your support.

01:13:07.313 --> 01:13:09.313
She comes home with us, Gary.

01:13:10.833 --> 01:13:13.313
Either that,
or we're leaving without you.

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:18.759
Car's out front.

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:25.633
Kayleigh!

01:13:27.313 --> 01:13:29.313
Kayleigh, wait!

01:13:30.313 --> 01:13:32.313
, I'm sorry.

01:13:34.047 --> 01:13:36.047
Hey, Tyler.

01:13:57.313 --> 01:13:59.313
What the...?

01:14:25.301 --> 01:14:28.140
I just wish you'd called me.
Or at least called for back-up.

01:14:28.141 --> 01:14:31.300
He'd have been long gone
before any of you lot turned up.

01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:33.300
- This is a warning.
- It's just someone being cocky.

01:14:33.301 --> 01:14:35.300
Thinking they can run rings around us.

01:14:35.301 --> 01:14:38.300
Ma'am, visitor.

01:14:38.301 --> 01:14:40.301
Said he'll only speak to you.

01:14:49.301 --> 01:14:50.981
I know where you can find him.

01:15:33.341 --> 01:15:36.300
Police, stay where you are!

01:15:43.301 --> 01:15:45.301
That's enough, son.

01:15:47.301 --> 01:15:49.300
Calm yourself down.

01:15:49.301 --> 01:15:51.660
Nathaniel Halpin, you are
under arrest on suspicion on murder.

01:15:51.661 --> 01:15:54.600
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

01:15:54.601 --> 01:15:55.940
if you do not mention when questioned

01:15:55.941 --> 01:15:57.300
something you rely on in court.

01:15:57.301 --> 01:16:00.301
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

01:16:17.301 --> 01:16:19.301
He can't hurt you, love.

01:16:21.301 --> 01:16:23.301
He'll know it was me, though.

01:16:35.301 --> 01:16:37.501
He'll just... know.

01:16:42.594 --> 01:16:44.594
Nat was working us too hard.

01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:50.301
Once you're going country,
you're on call 24/7.

01:16:53.301 --> 01:16:55.301
Caden started to smoke a bit of crack.

01:16:55.934 --> 01:16:57.934
To stay awake, he said.

01:17:00.821 --> 01:17:03.141
I told him he was asking for trouble.

01:17:04.301 --> 01:17:06.301
Drugs must've messed with his head.

01:17:10.301 --> 01:17:12.301
All this cash we were making,

01:17:13.007 --> 01:17:15.007
Caden was vexed
we weren't seeing any of it.

01:17:16.301 --> 01:17:18.301
Then Nat finds out the money's short.

01:17:20.301 --> 01:17:22.820
Tells us Caden had been taxing off him.

01:17:22.821 --> 01:17:25.803
So, stealing off the wrong man.

01:17:30.301 --> 01:17:32.820
A couple of days
after they found his body,

01:17:32.821 --> 01:17:38.300
Nat calls us up, and said Caden
had got what was coming to him.

01:17:38.301 --> 01:17:40.661
And I'd taken on my brother's debt.

01:17:41.587 --> 01:17:44.227
And would have to work harder
to pay it off.

01:17:44.821 --> 01:17:46.981
OK, son. OK.

01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:57.828
We've run a trace on your vehicle,
places you in Peyton three days ago.

01:17:57.829 --> 01:17:59.594
Yeah, I went up there
to visit my girlfriend.

01:17:59.595 --> 01:18:01.300
- Ah, Kayleigh Mincham?
- Yeah.

01:18:01.301 --> 01:18:05.300
Vulnerable lass,
who you took advantage of.

01:18:05.301 --> 01:18:09.300
You can add sexual grooming
to his list of offences.

01:18:09.301 --> 01:18:11.300
She's a junkie.

01:18:11.301 --> 01:18:13.300
Nothing she says
would ever stand up in court.

01:18:13.301 --> 01:18:17.501
No, I think you went up to Peyton
to see Declan Price.

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:21.300
Another vulnerable adult
who you've threatened.

01:18:21.301 --> 01:18:23.300
I've never seen him before.

01:18:23.301 --> 01:18:24.301
No?

01:18:24.302 --> 01:18:27.300
You supplied him with
two grams of heroin.

01:18:27.301 --> 01:18:29.300
Laced with a lethal amount of fentanyl.

01:18:29.301 --> 01:18:32.827
Which was in your flat
on Ferry Cross estate.

01:18:32.828 --> 01:18:34.300
I haven't been back there for a while.

01:18:34.301 --> 01:18:36.300
I don't like the neighbourhood.

01:18:36.301 --> 01:18:40.300
Ah, you favour the plush pad
in Jesmond, right?

01:18:40.301 --> 01:18:42.814
- Yeah.
- We've searched it.

01:18:42.815 --> 01:18:49.140
And we found pricey watches,
and designer clothing

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:52.300
and some of the items, well,
they're still in their wrapper.

01:18:52.301 --> 01:18:55.731
And we are satisfied that the money
used to buy those items

01:18:55.732 --> 01:18:57.300
was earned through dealing drugs.

01:18:57.301 --> 01:18:59.340
You can add that to the list.

01:18:59.341 --> 01:19:01.980
You've got nothing
to tie me to any of this.

01:19:01.981 --> 01:19:03.660
We've also got a witness,

01:19:03.661 --> 01:19:06.300
who said they were working for you
under duress.

01:19:06.301 --> 01:19:09.300
And based on that statement,

01:19:09.301 --> 01:19:13.500
you're also under arrest
on a charge of trafficking a minor.

01:19:13.501 --> 01:19:15.746
- Trafficking?
- Mm-hm.

01:19:16.323 --> 01:19:18.989
Well, we get you on drugs...

01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:23.301
I mean, that's almost
a badge of honour, isn't it?

01:19:23.603 --> 01:19:25.942
But trafficking kids,

01:19:25.943 --> 01:19:28.923
ooh, that doesn't go down
too well in prison.

01:19:31.683 --> 01:19:35.300
Now, Caden Lennon was working for you,

01:19:35.301 --> 01:19:37.300
running drugs to Peyton.

01:19:37.301 --> 01:19:41.301
We also know he was stealing from you.

01:19:41.683 --> 01:19:44.300
Taxing off money from your drugs deals.

01:19:44.301 --> 01:19:48.660
So he needed teaching a lesson,
didn't he?

01:19:48.661 --> 01:19:51.300
Now, our forensics team,

01:19:51.301 --> 01:19:56.301
they found traces of Caden's blood
in your vehicle.

01:19:57.643 --> 01:20:02.301
And that's all we need to charge you
with his murder.

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:06.883
So...

01:20:08.301 --> 01:20:11.003
if there's anything you'd like to add.

01:20:12.301 --> 01:20:14.301
No?

01:20:18.487 --> 01:20:19.683
No comment.

01:20:21.843 --> 01:20:24.301
I'd say you'd get 25 years.

01:20:26.301 --> 01:20:28.820
Which is a small price to pay,

01:20:28.821 --> 01:20:31.683
for all those lives you've ruined.

01:20:43.301 --> 01:20:45.301
We'll call when we get to the safe house.

01:21:10.301 --> 01:21:12.883
All right, love, come on.
We'll give you a lift home.

01:21:21.763 --> 01:21:24.300
Now, he's going to be fine, love.

01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:26.301
They'll look after him.

01:21:27.301 --> 01:21:29.300
Ooh.

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:32.300
I thought you might want your photo back.

01:21:32.301 --> 01:21:34.301
Here.

01:21:35.444 --> 01:21:37.661
I remember when they first arrived here.

01:21:38.163 --> 01:21:39.300
Pair of lost souls.

01:21:39.301 --> 01:21:41.300
They'd just lost their mam.

01:21:41.301 --> 01:21:43.300
Tyler wouldn't leave Caden's side.

01:21:43.301 --> 01:21:45.300
It took him months
before he'd trust anyone.

01:21:45.301 --> 01:21:50.220
Ah, well, He'd been through a lot.
They both had.

01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:52.825
Tyler had these terrible meltdowns.

01:21:52.826 --> 01:21:56.501
All that pent-up anger inside him.

01:21:57.003 --> 01:21:59.300
Even pushed his brother
down them stairs once.

01:21:59.301 --> 01:22:01.683
Broke his arm in two places.

01:22:13.474 --> 01:22:15.474
Christine?

01:22:18.821 --> 01:22:22.300
Does Tyler own a dark padded jacket?

01:22:22.301 --> 01:22:25.300
Yeah. He loves it.

01:22:29.301 --> 01:22:32.300
We're still stuck in town, ma'am.
Traffic's pretty heavy.

01:22:32.301 --> 01:22:34.151
Shut up, just listen to me.

01:22:34.152 --> 01:22:35.980
'I need you to turn the car round'

01:22:35.981 --> 01:22:38.225
and come back to the station.

01:22:38.226 --> 01:22:41.300
'Jack, I think you're sitting
next to our killer.

01:22:41.301 --> 01:22:43.300
'Get yourself back here.

01:22:43.301 --> 01:22:46.443
- 'Jack!'
- Got that, ma'am.

01:22:48.301 --> 01:22:51.301
Change of plan. Boss has requested
we head back to base.

01:22:52.143 --> 01:22:53.661
OK, righto.

01:22:57.301 --> 01:22:58.776
No, you don't!

01:22:58.777 --> 01:23:00.796
- Argh!
- Hey!

01:23:00.797 --> 01:23:02.300
- Shit.
- Tyler!

01:23:02.301 --> 01:23:03.661
Tyler, come here!

01:23:08.301 --> 01:23:10.300
Tyler!

01:23:10.301 --> 01:23:12.323
Argh!

01:23:17.301 --> 01:23:19.141
Jeez.

01:23:19.803 --> 01:23:22.660
We've done a search of
the immediate area, ma'am. No sign.

01:23:25.643 --> 01:23:29.140
Well, put out a call to Control.
Put out a description.

01:23:29.141 --> 01:23:31.300
He may be a threat
now he knows we're onto him.

01:23:31.301 --> 01:23:32.643
Will do, ma'am.

01:23:33.301 --> 01:23:35.300
He was out of the car
before I could catch him.

01:23:35.301 --> 01:23:37.980
None of us saw this coming, Jack.

01:23:37.981 --> 01:23:40.300
Now, I need you to
get back to the station.

01:23:40.301 --> 01:23:42.300
- I'm fine.
- That nose might be broken.

01:23:42.301 --> 01:23:43.603
Needs looking at.

01:23:49.301 --> 01:23:51.301
Where's a 15-year-old gonna hide?

01:24:44.301 --> 01:24:46.301
Caden said he wanted to stay here.

01:24:48.194 --> 01:24:51.003
Save up some money, buy us a place.

01:24:52.301 --> 01:24:53.963
View of the sea.

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.560
Just like his mam, eh?

01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:01.980
I tried to warn him.

01:25:03.301 --> 01:25:06.341
Told him we should just disappear.

01:25:07.112 --> 01:25:09.500
That why you argued on the day he died,

01:25:09.501 --> 01:25:12.300
when you were at Declan's house?

01:25:12.301 --> 01:25:14.603
He said he was too tired to run.

01:25:16.723 --> 01:25:19.660
Tired of starting over.

01:25:19.661 --> 01:25:22.980
Nat Halpin drove you to that boatyard

01:25:22.981 --> 01:25:25.300
and took you home afterwards.

01:25:25.301 --> 01:25:27.933
Your brother's blood
all over your clothes.

01:25:27.934 --> 01:25:30.981
He said I needed to prove
I was one of them.

01:25:33.301 --> 01:25:35.300
He even put the blade in me hand.

01:25:35.301 --> 01:25:37.963
Sent a lad to do his dirty work.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.640
He was hiding in one of the boats.

01:25:47.301 --> 01:25:49.821
So scared, he was shaking.

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:56.520
I took him in me arms.
He let me hold him.

01:25:57.981 --> 01:26:00.883
I told him not to worry,
that it'd all be OK.

01:26:04.301 --> 01:26:07.301
His look of surprise
as I pulled out a knife...

01:26:09.141 --> 01:26:11.660
The one person who always protected you.

01:26:11.661 --> 01:26:15.760
- I didn't have a choice!
- You killed your own brother...

01:26:15.761 --> 01:26:17.300
to prove you were a man?

01:26:17.301 --> 01:26:19.923
I was the care kid everyone picked on.

01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:24.980
A few steps behind him,
getting in his way.

01:26:24.981 --> 01:26:27.923
The butt of all the jokes.

01:26:29.301 --> 01:26:32.684
The little brother
Caden was forced to look after.

01:26:32.685 --> 01:26:35.300
Tell us, who's the man now, eh?

01:26:35.301 --> 01:26:37.794
Ten grand a week, we were clearing.

01:26:37.795 --> 01:26:41.300
Base, white, meth, weed, anything!

01:26:41.301 --> 01:26:42.820
I could get you anything to get high!

01:26:42.821 --> 01:26:46.216
Yeah, well,
that doesn't make you a man, love.

01:26:46.217 --> 01:26:50.301
Turning your back on those thugs
would've made you a man.

01:27:26.821 --> 01:27:29.301
Come on, son, on your feet.

01:27:36.643 --> 01:27:39.300
Got to you, this one, didn't it?

01:27:39.301 --> 01:27:41.563
And it didn't get to you?

01:27:42.301 --> 01:27:45.660
Two lads sold the promise of
a better life.

01:27:45.661 --> 01:27:48.140
What chance did they have, eh?

01:27:48.141 --> 01:27:49.530
The toerag who sold it to them

01:27:49.531 --> 01:27:51.590
won't be trading for the foreseeable.

01:27:51.591 --> 01:27:55.203
They'll be plenty more of them
lining up to take his place.

01:27:56.301 --> 01:27:58.981
We didn't even scratch the surface
of the problem.

01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:04.660
Right, I'm off.

01:28:07.301 --> 01:28:08.660
Should you be driving that?

01:28:08.661 --> 01:28:10.301
Eh?

01:28:10.723 --> 01:28:13.140
Garage said it's as good as new.

01:28:13.141 --> 01:28:14.300
Hardly!

01:28:14.301 --> 01:28:16.301
I heard that.

01:28:21.301 --> 01:28:25.301
Ah, this old thing...

01:28:25.707 --> 01:28:28.227
it's gonna last forever.

01:28:32.301 --> 01:28:34.301
