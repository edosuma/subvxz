You're, like,
old enough to be my dad.

It's not like that.
Nothing like that at all.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.458
I told you.
Your father looked
out for me.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.881
He was kind of
like an older brother.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.961
I know how hard
you and your mom
have had it since he died.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.884
I'm just paying it forward.

13:29.518 --> 13:30.724
Okay. Good.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.135
Okay.
Let's go try on some dresses.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.345
Hey.
Just do me one favor, okay?

13:34.439 --> 13:35.428
What's that?

13:35.524 --> 13:36.889
When you have
a grandson one day,

13:37.025 --> 13:39.482
and you will, promise me
you'll let him jump on the bed

13:39.569 --> 13:41.480
and eat lots of candy. Okay?

13:41.571 --> 13:42.902
Okay, I promise.
Great.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.731
It's not like I wanted to
hire a skywriter

13:45.909 --> 13:47.410
to write "I told you so"
over Yaletown,

13:47.494 --> 13:49.780
but, yeah,
I felt a little vindicated
by Ames' accident.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.123
Now maybe people
will finally wake up and see

13:52.374 --> 13:55.332
one more technological
miracle on its way
to being weaponized.

13:55.419 --> 13:58.206
So, is that what you
think Ames was doing,
Mr. Vincent, making weapons?

13:58.296 --> 13:59.456
You don't?

13:59.756 --> 14:01.337
I used to be in this field
before I realized

14:01.425 --> 14:03.006
the lie they were
trying to sell us.

than the scientists
who invent this stuff

14:14.771 --> 14:16.352
are the people
ready to cash in.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.896
And who might they be?

14:17.983 --> 14:19.723

14:27.284 --> 14:29.741
I mean,
you did threaten Ames' life.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.035
No. I said we'd
burn down his lab.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.117
Sounds like somebody
saved me the trouble.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.031
But you just told us
you were in that field.

the machine to backfire.

someone to pin this on,

14:57.814 --> 14:59.429
We weren't told
of any partner.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.855
Well, former partner.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.391
She grew unhappy
with the division

15:02.486 --> 15:04.602
of intellectual property
and had a falling out.

15:05.322 --> 15:08.485

it was her.

Yeah. I got it.

His vitals are stable
but his memory is gone.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.791
He doesn't seem to
know where he is.

15:34.935 --> 15:38.553
Melissa Dobeck and
Martin Ames' association
goes back to 2007.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.895
Both were professors
in the same
university department

15:40.982 --> 15:43.189
before they left to
form their own companies.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.859
So what are you thinking?

15:45.946 --> 15:49.404
I'm thinking there is
more to their relationship
than six proprietary patents,

15:49.491 --> 15:52.949
including one
covering the production
of thermal anti-neurons...

15:53.036 --> 15:54.651
Well, antimatter.

15:55.413 --> 15:58.405
Did anybody ever tell you
you watched too much
Star Trek as a kid?

16:00.961 --> 16:04.624
Martin and I
pioneered nano materials
for antimatter containment.

16:04.714 --> 16:08.172
Nuclear residue won't go away,
but antimatter,
it wants to disappear.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.376
So containment is everything.

16:10.470 --> 16:15.089
Okay. So you...
You and Professor Ames,
you found a way to contain it?

16:15.183 --> 16:17.890
The scale was very small.
I wanted to take it slow.

16:17.978 --> 16:21.061
But Martin had a much more
ambitious agenda.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.854
I thought it was reckless.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.273
When you left the university
and your company split up,

16:25.360 --> 16:27.100
it looks like Ames
held onto all the patents.

16:27.195 --> 16:29.356
Even in death
he got the better of you.

16:31.491 --> 16:35.075
Do you want me to
dance on his grave?
I won't do that.

16:35.871 --> 16:37.907
Our differences
were very public.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.951
I thought Martin's work
would eventually kill someone.

And that you'd be one of them.

16:51.845 --> 16:57.010
Ifyou're suggesting
that I was involved,
that's completely false.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.261
I don't think
anybody was accusing you.

16:59.561 --> 17:00.971
Actually, I was.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.221

critical research files

17:04.441 --> 17:06.557
from
the professor's laboratory.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.108
I didn't take them.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.904
And the worst I
ever did to Martin
was wish him dead.

I find that hard to believe.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.357
Oh, believe what you want.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.735
Why did you text
Shane Mathers yesterday

24:52.867 --> 24:55.233
just hours after
the body was found?

24:55.411 --> 24:58.744
I expressed my sympathies,
my shock.

24:59.749 --> 25:01.990
I don't remember
the exact words.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.996
And then again this morning.

25:06.464 --> 25:08.750
Were you
synchronizing your stories?

25:09.509 --> 25:11.124
We're clone.

25:11.844 --> 25:14.051
Failing to
mention your involvement

25:14.180 --> 25:16.387
with Professor Ames'
closest assistant

25:16.474 --> 25:18.590
is a pretty serious
omission of fact.

25:18.685 --> 25:19.845
Is that what he told you?

25:19.936 --> 25:22.723
No. Actually,
that's what you just told us.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.350
How long have you
been sleeping with him?

25:26.192 --> 25:29.810
Shane and I had a fling.
I'm not proud of it,
but it's over.

25:30.071 --> 25:31.311
I'm engaged.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.487
That's awkward.
Mmm.

25:33.574 --> 25:34.905
CARLOS: Does he know
that he's odd man out?

25:34.992 --> 25:36.653
Did you ask him that?

25:37.620 --> 25:38.951
I thought not.

25:39.455 --> 25:40.991
Goodbye, Detectives.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.788
Don't come back
without a warrant.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.167
KAGAME: You say you’re free.

26:25.626 --> 26:29.118
You point to
your Constitution,
your bill of rights.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.370
What rights?

26:32.091 --> 26:35.925
You were born
into crushing debt,
to parents without hope.

26:36.012 --> 26:39.004
And your only right
is to work for the corporation

26:39.098 --> 26:40.963
until you pay it off.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.549
Except that can never happen,

26:44.061 --> 26:47.019
because everything
you need, they provide.

26:47.398 --> 26:51.107
Your shelter,
your food, your water,

26:51.819 --> 26:56.609
and it all sends you deeper
into the abyss of slavery.

26:57.617 --> 27:00.029
But all that can change,
my friends.

27:01.829 --> 27:05.162
We have the power
to free ourselves.

27:05.917 --> 27:10.251
To take back what we've lost,
our independence, our dignity,

27:10.755 --> 27:12.336
our very souls,

27:13.007 --> 27:15.498
to take back our liberty.

28:18.406 --> 28:19.612
Patent infringement?

28:19.824 --> 28:21.780
It has only recently
come to my attention

28:21.951 --> 28:24.363
that there may have
been a prior theft
of intellectual property

28:24.453 --> 28:27.581
that is unrelated
to the murder
of Professor Ames.

28:28.249 --> 28:29.284
Unrelated?

28:29.792 --> 28:30.781
Mm-hmm.

28:32.378 --> 28:38.999
I see. Well, then,
if in fact your totally
unrelated investigation

28:39.093 --> 28:42.506
happens to lead you
to Professor Ames' murderer,

28:42.930 --> 28:44.670
I want to be
the first to know.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.343
Because I'm going to enjoy
calling that dumbass

28:47.435 --> 28:50.097
from National Defense
to tell him
we just solved his case.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.470
I took the liberty
of having the unit
pick up Mathers.

28:52.565 --> 28:53.975
They're en route.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.567

with Melissa Dobeck?

29:00.740 --> 29:02.355
Is that why I'm here?

29:03.451 --> 29:05.783
Are you accusing me
of dating my former boss?

29:05.912 --> 29:08.779
We know she texted you
hours after Ames' death.

(STUTTERS)

29:14.253 --> 29:15.413
Mm-mmm.

29:17.673 --> 29:20.210
All right, look,
I just...

29:20.301 --> 29:23.043
I didn't want to
implicate her for no reason.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.924
What about that text
would have implicated her?

29:29.393 --> 29:30.599
Did you kill Professor Ames?

29:30.728 --> 29:31.934
What? No.

29:32.355 --> 29:34.641
The device killed him.

29:35.608 --> 29:36.893
He brought this on himself.

29:36.984 --> 29:40.021
He was pushing
a new technology
too aggressively.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.318
I understand.

29:41.656 --> 29:43.772
It wasn'tjust himself
he was putting at risk.

29:43.866 --> 29:45.151
No.

29:45.368 --> 29:47.609
I came very close to
quitting several times.

29:48.245 --> 29:50.987
It got to the point
where I couldn't sleep,

29:51.624 --> 29:53.489
thinking about what
we might be unleashing.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.491
You were creating
something powerful,

29:55.628 --> 29:57.493
something you didn't
fully understand.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.461
But Melissa did.

29:59.632 --> 30:02.374
Melissa had
nothing to do with this!

30:02.551 --> 30:04.166
To do with what, Shane?

30:04.387 --> 30:05.547
The plot to kill Ames?

30:05.638 --> 30:07.048
She's a good person.

30:08.432 --> 30:11.970
And Martin couldn't
hold a candle to her
as a scientist.

30:12.061 --> 30:15.053
But he took all the patents,
he took all the credit.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.399
Ifyou really cared about her,
you would have done something.

30:17.483 --> 30:18.598
You'd help her getjustice.

30:18.734 --> 30:19.894
No.

30:20.069 --> 30:22.731

for you to sabotage Calisto.

30:22.822 --> 30:25.689
You knew the experiment,
you helped design it.

30:26.117 --> 30:28.859
Did you know
Melissa was engaged?

30:34.417 --> 30:36.408
You didn't, did you?

30:37.211 --> 30:40.044
Oh, she played you
the whole time.

30:42.383 --> 30:44.795
Did you hand
the files over to her?

30:46.262 --> 30:47.593
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.467
I'm talking about charging you
with conspiring to
kill Martin Ames.

30:50.558 --> 30:52.264
I didn't conspire with anyone!

30:52.351 --> 30:53.932
But you admit to killing him.

30:54.478 --> 30:57.345
We have all your
communications.
The truth will come out.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.563

31:15.458 --> 31:17.995
You don't have to fall
on your lightsaber for her.

31:18.169 --> 31:19.875
She's behind this.
We both know that.

31:19.962 --> 31:22.248
No. You're wrong about her.

31:23.799 --> 31:27.712
You wanted
a confession and you got one,
but I acted alone.

31:27.803 --> 31:29.384
What did you do
with the research?

31:29.680 --> 31:34.174
I deleted it so no one
could ever use it again.

31:43.944 --> 31:45.775
Why is he protecting her?

31:46.489 --> 31:50.073
I don't know. I've seen guys
do a lot of crazy
things for love.

31:50.785 --> 31:53.652
There has to be
a way to get to her
without his testimony.

31:53.746 --> 31:55.452
Kiera, we've bent
the rules to breaking.

31:55.706 --> 31:57.446

did you want Ames dead

because he was
selling it to the military,

38:30.517 --> 38:31.893
How did you do that?

38:32.060 --> 38:33.561
Promotion, remember?

38:33.854 --> 38:37.267
SadTech's latest rollout
in partnership
with Laroche Energy.

38:37.357 --> 38:41.691
Thousands of
redundant mini fusion reactors
linked in a network.

38:41.945 --> 38:46.188
No more centralized reactors
means no more easy
targets for the terrorists.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.532
They will just find
something else to target.

38:48.619 --> 38:50.701
Another part of
the infrastructure.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.323
No. They're scrambling.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.243
A bunch of
revolutionary malcontents

38:55.334 --> 38:58.292
that think an insurgency
will change everything.

38:58.378 --> 38:59.879
They're on the run.

39:01.089 --> 39:03.171
If you really want to do
something about them,

39:03.258 --> 39:04.873
you should join the CPS.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.128
They're recruiting.

39:06.220 --> 39:09.087
With your military service
you'd be a lock for Protector.

39:09.223 --> 39:11.214
Well, I have always wanted to.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.431
I'm ready when you are.

39:14.144 --> 39:15.384
I know.

39:16.271 --> 39:19.729
But let's be honest,
it's gonna take more
than a few blackouts

39:19.816 --> 39:22.398
to tear me away from
my most importantjob.

39:33.247 --> 39:34.703
The fact that you
were slightly further

39:34.831 --> 39:36.332
from the device
when it went off

39:36.416 --> 39:38.998
may have accounted
for your
different arrival time.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.793
Makes you wonder
who else might
be coming through?

39:41.880 --> 39:43.620
SONYA: Or who already has.

39:44.550 --> 39:45.790
It doesn't matter.

39:47.803 --> 39:49.759
What matters is
we've all been given

39:49.888 --> 39:51.799
the most precious
gift life offers.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.472
A second chance.

39:55.936 --> 39:57.676
Who has been in
charge in my absence?

40:00.148 --> 40:01.354
lhave.

40:03.944 --> 40:05.434
You've lost soldiers.

40:05.988 --> 40:07.728
We've become more vigilant.

40:11.201 --> 40:12.862
We'll have to be.

40:14.329 --> 40:15.739
There's a war coming.

40:15.956 --> 40:17.321
How can you be so sure?

40:20.085 --> 40:21.916
Because we're
going to start it.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.911
No, no, no, no! It's okay.
It's me. It's Alec.

41:06.006 --> 41:07.086
Alec?

41:07.174 --> 41:08.539
The guy in your head.

41:10.636 --> 41:12.046
Did you really think
breaking into my apartment

41:12.137 --> 41:13.502
was the best way to
introduce yourself?

41:13.597 --> 41:16.509
I'm sorry.
I just got tired of waiting.

41:18.518 --> 41:20.224
I found your suit.

41:20.896 --> 41:22.932
So, you were going
through my things?

41:23.023 --> 41:25.730
It's way ahead of
anything that I've imagined.

41:28.445 --> 41:29.981
It's even better
when itworks.

41:30.197 --> 41:31.653
Well, lwas going
through my dad's notes.

41:31.740 --> 41:33.981
There may be a way to trigger
the self-repair mechanism.

41:34.076 --> 41:36.283
Look. I told you
I didn't want you
to get involved.

41:36.745 --> 41:38.360
Well, I guess I'm like you.

41:38.455 --> 41:39.661
A little stubborn.

41:43.502 --> 41:44.992
How long will you need it for?

41:45.128 --> 41:46.664
It's not like dry cleaning.

41:47.089 --> 41:49.250
Do you have dry cleaning
in the future?

41:49.508 --> 41:53.296
Clean water's at a premium,
so all cleaning
is dry cleaning.

41:53.428 --> 41:55.089
Pulse vibration.

41:55.722 --> 41:57.587
Eight seconds, 30 credits.

41:58.392 --> 41:59.677
This'll take longer.

42:01.937 --> 42:04.679
I noticed today,
you turned off your HUD
a couple of times.

42:04.773 --> 42:06.263
I don't get it.

42:07.901 --> 42:09.357
I was curious.

42:10.153 --> 42:12.064
Yeah. But doesn't that
make yourjob harder?

42:12.155 --> 42:14.316
Your tech can tell
you so much more.

42:14.491 --> 42:16.356
Alec, I have to
confront the possibility

42:16.493 --> 42:18.358
that if my suit
can't be repaired,

42:19.287 --> 42:21.369
I have to do my
job without it.

42:21.456 --> 42:24.323
I thought maybe you
were trusting your gut
instead of your tech.

42:24.418 --> 42:25.703
Like Carlos?

42:26.753 --> 42:28.163
I was.

42:30.006 --> 42:31.416
Felt good.

42:38.056 --> 42:39.842
Why did you
let that woman go?

42:43.520 --> 42:45.226
I had no choice.

42:45.689 --> 42:48.305
But you knew Ames' assistant
wasn't acting alone.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.307
That's not the point.

42:50.444 --> 42:51.650
Then what is the point?

42:53.363 --> 42:57.106
Every student in the union
learns about
Melissa Laroche in school.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.650
She solved
the global energy crisis

43:00.746 --> 43:02.657
with her development
of clean fusion.

43:04.040 --> 43:07.282
She's going to do great things
with Ames' research.
Important things.

43:07.377 --> 43:09.413
So important
she gets away with murder?

43:11.298 --> 43:12.788
I'm not happy about it.

43:14.801 --> 43:18.635
But if! make
the wrong decision,
millions could be affected.

43:19.014 --> 43:21.972
So if these scientists
are playing God,

43:23.393 --> 43:25.054
in a way, so are you.

43:28.315 --> 43:29.555
That's messed up.
