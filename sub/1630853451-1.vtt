00:14.849 --> 00:18.485

00:18.586 --> 00:22.022

00:57.792 --> 01:00.562

01:36.931 --> 01:39.433
(crackling)

01:41.836 --> 01:46.608
(suspenseful electronic music)
(coin clattering)

01:46.708 --> 01:49.677
(video game dings)

02:08.328 --> 02:12.299
(intense electronic music)

03:06.286 --> 03:09.023
- You guys know who I
picked up at the airport?

03:09.123 --> 03:11.092
- Who?
- Tim Waters.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.292
- Who?

03:13.094 --> 03:15.462
- The Bill Clinton impersonator.

03:15.563 --> 03:18.166
Not just any Bill Clinton impersonator,

03:18.265 --> 03:21.035
the Bill Clinton impersonator.

03:21.135 --> 03:25.973
He's the one who does the
fancy dinners and the TV shows.

03:26.074 --> 03:28.241
Sometimes with Clinton. Yeah.

03:28.341 --> 03:30.178
(soft guitar music)

03:30.277 --> 03:32.113
That's a big deal, you know?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.380
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.683
So I pick him up from the airport.

03:35.783 --> 03:40.188
I'm looking at him my rearview
and he looks familiar,

03:40.287 --> 03:41.823
you know, but it's dark and it's,

03:41.923 --> 03:45.526
it's been a while since he
was relevant or whatever.

03:45.626 --> 03:48.996
So I'm having a hard time
putting my finger on it.

03:49.097 --> 03:53.000
And he sees me looking at him and he goe

03:53.101 --> 03:54.535
he goes full Bill Clinton.

03:54.635 --> 03:59.207
He goes, "I did not have sexual
relations with that woman."

03:59.306 --> 04:02.275
(both laugh)

04:02.375 --> 04:06.914
- Where was he going?
- Um, Hilton on O'Farrell.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.149
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.250
Uh, he said he was in
town over the weekend

04:10.350 --> 04:14.989
and that he had a comedy
show at a club in town

04:15.089 --> 04:17.524
and he flew in from Vegas, so.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.192
- Sounds like he's doing pretty well.

04:19.291 --> 04:20.528
- Yeah, well, let's put it this way.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.263
It's good thing for
him Clinton won in '96.

04:25.499 --> 04:28.468
- Hey, did you get his autograph?

04:28.569 --> 04:31.706
- Nah. Who the hell cares?

04:34.142 --> 04:37.545
Now if it were Christina Aguilera.

04:38.179 --> 04:39.279
(chuckles) Oh.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.416
You remember that song that
she did that, that first one?

04:43.518 --> 04:46.621
- "Genie in a Bottle."
- Yes, that is the one.

04:46.721 --> 04:49.356
♪ Genie in a bottle, baby ♪

04:49.456 --> 04:52.260
Uh. You remember that video?

04:52.359 --> 04:56.264
Oh, back in the day
when that video came on

04:56.363 --> 04:57.899
and I was by myself,

04:57.999 --> 05:00.735
I just had these elaborate fa...

05:00.835 --> 05:03.838
(crackling)

05:03.938 --> 05:05.305
What time you got?

05:05.405 --> 05:07.542
- 10:15.
- Ah.

05:08.576 --> 05:11.145
- Well, in that case I better get going.

05:11.245 --> 05:13.047
- Come on, Marv, you just now got here.

05:13.147 --> 05:14.282
- Double shift tomorrow.

05:14.381 --> 05:15.750
Driving grand, brother.

05:16.449 --> 05:20.621
- Driving gra, what are you short on cas

05:21.522 --> 05:23.891
- Can't pay rent with
smiles and dick jokes.

05:24.559 --> 05:26.294
- Maybe if you work on your delivery.

05:26.393 --> 05:29.564
(door opens and closes)

05:29.664 --> 05:31.098
He's a theater actor.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.937
He thinks I don't know but
he's got a show tonight.

05:36.037 --> 05:37.305
Artsy-fartsy.

05:37.404 --> 05:38.206
- Hmm.

05:38.306 --> 05:40.174
(slow blues music)

05:40.274 --> 05:41.809
- What about you?
- Mm?

05:41.909 --> 05:43.010
- Done for the night?

05:44.712 --> 05:47.048
Oh. Burning the a midnight oil.

05:48.049 --> 05:48.950
Good for you.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.552
Get your hustle on.

05:52.419 --> 05:53.521
Mm, well...

05:56.190 --> 05:57.457
I hope you have a good night, Dave.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.560
Maybe I will see you around.

06:00.895 --> 06:01.796
Okay.

06:04.332 --> 06:06.868
(crackling)

06:06.968 --> 06:09.537
(traffic whirring)

06:09.637 --> 06:12.306
(slow blues music)

06:12.405 --> 06:15.375
- More coffee?
- Yes, thank you.

06:18.613 --> 06:20.815
How have you been?
- Okay, I guess.

06:21.716 --> 06:22.617
You?

06:23.416 --> 06:24.719
- I'm good.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.120
- Okay, well it wasn't that good

06:26.220 --> 06:28.189
since it was an inservice day today,

06:28.289 --> 06:29.657
which just means that there's no school,

06:29.757 --> 06:31.391
which means that I was home all day.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.628
And I mean all day, which means

06:33.728 --> 06:34.962
I'm running on three hours of sleep.

06:35.062 --> 06:35.930
- Mm.

06:37.932 --> 06:41.202
(soft blues music)

06:41.302 --> 06:43.738
- Can I show you something?

06:44.404 --> 06:45.506
- Sure.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.915
What's that?

06:54.015 --> 06:56.517
- This is a collection of random things

06:56.617 --> 07:00.988
written on halls, stalls and
walls of public bathrooms.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.627
(chuckles) Okay, I know that sounds craz

07:06.727 --> 07:08.362
but just give it a chance.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.331
I wanna read you something.
It's pretty short.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.532
- Okay.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.071
- "She dances carefree and loose

07:17.171 --> 07:19.840
as if a heavy burden had
been lifted from her.

07:22.009 --> 07:27.048
She looked so happy, I couldn't
look away, scared as I was.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.687
And though the moment
seemed to last forever,

07:32.787 --> 07:34.755
she was gone the moment after."

07:37.224 --> 07:38.859
What do you think?

07:39.827 --> 07:41.796
- It's good.
- Yeah? (chuckles)

07:41.896 --> 07:42.797
- I like it.

07:44.065 --> 07:45.633
- Me too. It's definitely my favorite on

07:45.733 --> 07:50.571
This one always leaves me
wondering, you know, who wrote it?

07:50.738 --> 07:53.473
What they were thinking?
What inspired them?

07:53.574 --> 07:55.309
Who inspired them?

07:55.409 --> 07:57.445
- Doesn't say who wrote it?

07:57.545 --> 08:00.047
- No. Most of these don't have authors.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.083
Graffiti and all.

08:02.984 --> 08:05.553
(slow blues music)

08:05.653 --> 08:09.223
(door opens and closes)

08:12.159 --> 08:13.194
I gotta go.
- Yeah.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.210
- What can I get for you?

08:29.310 --> 08:30.978
(indistinct chattering)

08:31.078 --> 08:34.115
(upbeat rock music)

08:36.683 --> 08:41.922

10:59.960 --> 11:05.199

(button clicking)

11:06.501 --> 11:09.870
(arcade game beeping)

11:27.254 --> 11:29.890
(hands pound)

11:32.359 --> 11:35.162
- Mm!
(hands pound)

11:35.262 --> 11:37.965
(Lenny sighs)

11:39.733 --> 11:40.868
- What's his deal?

11:41.670 --> 11:43.437
- Someone beat his high score.

11:44.573 --> 11:45.472
- Really?

11:46.140 --> 11:48.943
- Yeah. He's been here since last night.

11:49.043 --> 11:50.978
Hasn't taken a break in hours.

11:51.979 --> 11:55.716
- Oh. Should we maybe
tell him to take a break?

11:56.518 --> 11:59.253
- You wanna die? Be my guest.

12:00.054 --> 12:03.057
But I heard some stories and...

12:09.730 --> 12:10.831
Hey Lenny.

12:13.234 --> 12:15.836
Look, I, I could just make it free play.

12:18.506 --> 12:21.141
- Just give me the quarters. Hmm?

12:21.242 --> 12:24.144
(hard rock music)

12:31.385 --> 12:34.288
(button clicking)

12:38.892 --> 12:42.631
(Lenny sighs)
(hands pound)

12:42.731 --> 12:45.499
(Lenny sighing)

12:48.603 --> 12:51.105
(crackling)

12:54.908 --> 12:58.078
(traffic whirring)

13:01.415 --> 13:04.251
(phone ringing)

13:13.695 --> 13:14.562
- Hello?

13:15.530 --> 13:18.065
- Hi. I'd like to call a cab.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.001
- Where are you?

13:21.770 --> 13:23.937
- I'm at the Flamingo Motel in Alameda.

13:24.038 --> 13:25.507
Do you know where that is?

13:25.607 --> 13:27.676
- Yeah.
- Great.

13:27.776 --> 13:31.211
When can you get here?
- Uh, 10 minutes.

13:31.312 --> 13:32.212
Is that okay?

13:34.081 --> 13:35.349
- I'll be waiting.

13:42.423 --> 13:45.727
(traffic whirring)

13:45.826 --> 13:48.896
(arcade games beeping)

13:48.996 --> 13:52.232
(upbeat rock music)

14:19.527 --> 14:22.296
(phone buzzing)

14:38.747 --> 14:41.583
(cash crinkling)

14:48.823 --> 14:51.992
(traffic whirring)

14:52.861 --> 14:55.896
(car approaches)

14:57.431 --> 15:00.467
(suspenseful music)

15:14.549 --> 15:17.251
(door closes)

15:27.629 --> 15:29.263
- [Dave] Where to?

15:30.799 --> 15:32.032
- [Cara] Just drive.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.137
- [Dave] Can I have your name?

15:38.305 --> 15:38.873
- Cara.

15:38.972 --> 15:42.276
(suspenseful music)

15:46.313 --> 15:48.215
- [Dave] Do you have an address?

15:49.950 --> 15:51.985
A specific place?

15:54.054 --> 15:55.723
- [Cara] I haven't decided yet.

15:57.625 --> 15:59.661
- [Dave] Look, I can drive
you around all night.

15:59.761 --> 16:04.298
That's not a problem, but the
meter is gonna be running.

16:04.398 --> 16:06.768
So if money is gonna be an issue.

16:06.868 --> 16:08.503
- It's not. I've got money.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.705
I just need you to drive.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.073
- Okay.

16:26.888 --> 16:30.057
(tires screeching)

16:35.964 --> 16:38.633
(Lenny sighs)

16:38.733 --> 16:41.703
(traffic whirring)

17:08.161 --> 17:11.397
(package crinkling)

17:25.012 --> 17:28.214
(siren wailing)

17:28.315 --> 17:31.553
(package crinkling)

17:44.799 --> 17:47.301
(crackling)

18:04.318 --> 18:08.355
(tape clacking and whirring)

18:13.695 --> 18:16.463
(ominous music)

18:18.032 --> 18:21.669
- [Boss] Desperate people respond to fea

18:24.271 --> 18:28.509
They've been condition
that way all their lives.

18:30.578 --> 18:33.514
Things were different before I came alon

18:34.849 --> 18:40.287
Chaos, wretched place marred
by decades of neglect,

18:41.522 --> 18:44.759
A dying city, desperately hanging on

18:45.492 --> 18:49.496
like the last leaf
clinging to a dying tree.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.868
Then I came along and took control.

18:59.007 --> 19:01.909
I need you to do something for me.

19:03.111 --> 19:04.545
There's a girl.

19:05.445 --> 19:08.549
Find her and bring her to me.

19:08.650 --> 19:11.418
(ominous music)

19:19.827 --> 19:23.263
(soft dramatic music)

19:27.035 --> 19:28.603
- Everything's changed here.

19:30.638 --> 19:33.340
I can barely recognize this place.

19:46.486 --> 19:47.789
- You from around here?

19:53.427 --> 19:54.662
- I grew up here.

19:57.765 --> 19:58.933
- What brings you back?

19:59.033 --> 20:01.869
(siren wailing)

20:04.204 --> 20:05.707
- Unfinished business.

20:17.885 --> 20:18.953
Do you drink?

20:19.053 --> 20:20.555
- Not while I'm driving.

20:20.655 --> 20:21.556
- Obviously.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.290
Do you like beer?

20:23.390 --> 20:25.325
- Yeah, I like beer.

20:27.995 --> 20:29.530
- What about Mortal Kombat?

20:35.737 --> 20:38.840
(upbeat rock music)
(arcade games beeping)

20:38.940 --> 20:42.375
(customers chattering)

20:43.376 --> 20:46.547
(bottles clinking)

20:53.420 --> 20:56.624
(buttons clicking)

21:10.138 --> 21:11.739
- You're really good.

21:11.839 --> 21:14.374
- Anybody can beat it if they
have a basic understanding

21:14.474 --> 21:17.578
of the game and a decent combination

21:17.678 --> 21:21.649
of critical thinking
and mechanical prowess.

21:22.583 --> 21:25.086
This is nothing compared
to Quake or Road Wars.

21:25.186 --> 21:27.622
Those games require skill

21:27.722 --> 21:29.289
and you're competing
against another player,

21:29.389 --> 21:31.125
which makes it way harder.

21:32.026 --> 21:34.494
To master the arcade
version of Mortal Kombat,

21:34.595 --> 21:37.031
honestly, takes above average memory

21:37.131 --> 21:38.365
and pattern recognition.

21:38.465 --> 21:41.636
(buttons clicking)

21:44.404 --> 21:45.540
(arcade games beeping)
You ever see

21:45.640 --> 21:47.407
a perfect run before?

21:50.077 --> 21:53.313
(buttons clicking)

21:57.718 --> 21:59.452
Did you know that Mortal Kombat II

21:59.554 --> 22:02.990
was the first ever fighting
game to feature air combos?

22:04.192 --> 22:06.393
Well, after Midway went bankrupt,

22:06.493 --> 22:08.629
the development team was
acquired by Warner Brothers,

22:08.729 --> 22:12.600
but then later rebranded
as NetherRealm Studios.

22:13.501 --> 22:15.169
Originally, it was meant to be

22:15.269 --> 22:16.704
a Jean-Claude Van Damme fighting game

22:16.804 --> 22:20.508
featuring Jean-Claude's
character in "Universal Soldier."

22:20.608 --> 22:22.777
But then that fell through so I guess

22:22.877 --> 22:25.880
the creators went with a
fantasy horror theme instead.

22:28.549 --> 22:30.751
Imagine if we got the Van Damme version.

22:30.852 --> 22:32.452
(arcade games beeping)
(customers chattering)

22:32.553 --> 22:36.423
(upbeat electronic music)

22:41.562 --> 22:43.531
You sure I can't get you a drink?

22:45.099 --> 22:46.234
- I'm good.

22:46.334 --> 22:47.668
- Just one drink.

22:49.337 --> 22:50.938
- I don't drink and drive.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.676
(Cara sighs)

22:56.677 --> 22:59.714
- You know what StarCraft
2 pros do when they retire?

23:01.749 --> 23:03.684
They stream Road Wars for fun.

23:06.287 --> 23:08.022
They do. It's true.

23:08.122 --> 23:09.023
- I believe it.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.429
- You ever see an Uber
driver and just have

23:16.530 --> 23:19.399
the urge to kick his teeth in?

23:20.902 --> 23:22.870
- No.
- No?

23:22.970 --> 23:24.404
Never?
- Never.

23:24.505 --> 23:26.307
- Not even from like a second?

23:26.406 --> 23:28.109
- I'm not a violent person.

23:28.209 --> 23:30.878
- "I am not a violent person."

23:35.448 --> 23:37.051
Neither was the Dalai Lama.

23:39.921 --> 23:42.957
- (chuckles) What's that supposed to mea

23:57.437 --> 23:58.205
- Boom.

23:58.306 --> 24:00.841
(crackling)

24:00.942 --> 24:02.643
(customers chattering)
(upbeat rock music)

24:02.743 --> 24:04.912
So how long have you been a cab driver?

24:06.580 --> 24:08.349
- A few years.

24:08.448 --> 24:11.719
- Okay. What did you do before?

24:13.554 --> 24:14.755
- A lot of things.

24:15.890 --> 24:16.791
- Like?

24:20.061 --> 24:21.461
- I was a cellar man.

24:22.563 --> 24:24.231
- What's a cellar man?

24:24.332 --> 24:25.232
- Beer maker.

24:25.933 --> 24:28.636
- Really?
- I mean, nothing creative,

24:28.736 --> 24:31.706
mostly rolling barrels,
cleaning hard lines,

24:31.806 --> 24:34.241
checking CO2 levels, nothing special.

24:34.342 --> 24:35.843
- No, you're basically a beer expert.

24:35.943 --> 24:39.647
- No, I wouldn't go so far
as to call myself an expert.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.922
- How's this one?

24:53.561 --> 24:55.763
- (chuckles) It's fine.

24:56.931 --> 24:57.631
- Fine?

24:57.732 --> 24:59.033
- It's a safe choice.

25:01.802 --> 25:04.739
- All right, cellar man,
what would you recommend?

25:04.839 --> 25:06.907
What's the best thing they have here?

25:20.755 --> 25:22.256
- Bitter Irony.

25:22.356 --> 25:23.924
- Is that your final answer?

25:24.025 --> 25:25.259
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

25:25.893 --> 25:31.132
(upbeat electronic music)
(arcade games beeping)

25:31.565 --> 25:32.767
Hey.
- Hey.

25:32.867 --> 25:35.169
- Can I get a pin of your
Bitter Irony, please.

25:35.269 --> 25:36.237
- Coming right up.

25:37.671 --> 25:39.306
Here you go.
- Thanks.

25:48.616 --> 25:50.184
- What's your verdict?

25:57.658 --> 25:59.560
- It's really good.

26:01.562 --> 26:03.597
It's not that bitter.

26:07.502 --> 26:12.740
(ominous music)
(phone ringing)

26:25.319 --> 26:28.523
(voicemail beeps)

26:28.622 --> 26:29.890
- Tell him I'm in.

26:31.526 --> 26:33.894
And he's got nothing to worry about.

26:35.262 --> 26:37.532
You'll see me once tonight

26:37.631 --> 26:39.867
and once more when the job is done.

26:40.868 --> 26:42.236
And then I'm gone.

26:47.441 --> 26:51.145
(intense electronic music)

28:03.117 --> 28:05.719
(mellow music)

28:05.819 --> 28:09.323
- Level 256, kill screen.
Do you know what that is?

28:10.691 --> 28:11.792
- No.

28:14.361 --> 28:17.932
- It's when you get to
the 256 level in Pac-Man

28:18.032 --> 28:20.768
and the game glitches and
the whole right-hand side

28:20.868 --> 28:23.037
of the screen becomes a jumble

28:23.137 --> 28:26.340
of letters, numbers, and shapes.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.376
The original Pac-Man's level
counter was just a single byte.

28:29.476 --> 28:34.915
So it was only capable of
storing 256 distinct values,

28:35.916 --> 28:40.354
zero to 255, so reaching level 256

28:40.454 --> 28:43.824
causes a buffer overflow,
meaning that the data

28:43.924 --> 28:46.894
in all other areas of the
stack have to be rewritten.

28:48.128 --> 28:50.297
- Have you ever-
- Yeah, three times.

28:51.232 --> 28:53.568
At an arcade in Tokyo, a
bar in Huntington Beach

28:53.668 --> 28:55.469
and the bar we were just at.

28:56.237 --> 28:59.740
- So you've played through
256 levels of Pac-Man?

28:59.840 --> 29:02.109
- Yeah.
- In one sitting?

29:02.843 --> 29:03.944
- Standing.

29:05.045 --> 29:06.914
- How long did that take?

29:07.014 --> 29:08.749
- About six hours.

29:09.850 --> 29:11.819
(Dave chuckles)

29:11.919 --> 29:13.821
You ever see that photo
of the homeless guy

29:13.921 --> 29:15.523
holding that sign that reads,

29:15.624 --> 29:20.060
"Ninjas killed my family. Need
money for karate lessons."

29:20.160 --> 29:21.061
- Yeah.

29:22.162 --> 29:25.567
- Well, what's funny is
that somewhere out there

29:25.667 --> 29:28.002
at some point in time, they're
really has been a person

29:28.102 --> 29:29.870
whose family's been killed by ninjas

29:29.970 --> 29:31.405
and needs money for karate lessons

29:31.506 --> 29:34.609
so they can avenge their
family years later.

29:34.709 --> 29:35.776
- I'm sure that's been the case

29:35.876 --> 29:37.911
at least a few times in history.

29:39.947 --> 29:41.215
- Or maybe in lieu of lessons,

29:41.315 --> 29:43.117
they're picked up by a rival ninja clan

29:43.217 --> 29:46.053
and spend years and years
training under the tutelage

29:46.153 --> 29:48.956
of an old karate master
until they're ready

29:49.056 --> 29:52.426
to reign down their
blood-soaked vengeance.

29:53.127 --> 29:56.497
(soft dramatic music)

30:20.588 --> 30:23.090

And people like you and I.

41:20.081 --> 41:23.084
Things were different before I came alon

41:24.352 --> 41:29.790
Chaos, wretched place marred
by decades of neglect.

41:31.325 --> 41:34.862
A dying city desperately hanging on

41:34.962 --> 41:39.567
like the last leaf
clinging to a dying tree.

41:40.634 --> 41:44.271
Then I came along and took control.

41:45.906 --> 41:47.842
I'm afraid my time may be up.

41:54.415 --> 41:56.917
I need you to do something for me.

41:59.020 --> 41:59.920

42:01.355 --> 42:03.891

43:35.015 --> 43:37.586

43:37.685 --> 43:38.786
- You married?

43:39.653 --> 43:40.754
- Uh, no.

43:41.856 --> 43:44.091
- You got a lady friend or something?

43:45.860 --> 43:47.328
- No.

you could be with?
(Dave chuckles)

43:50.397 --> 43:51.298
- Okay.

43:52.233 --> 43:55.604
So who's the girl? And
how did she hurt you?

43:55.703 --> 43:57.771
- How do you know I didn't hurt her?

43:58.472 --> 44:00.141
- You? Come on.

44:00.241 --> 44:01.175
I doubt it.

44:02.843 --> 44:04.579

44:29.136 --> 44:31.739
the saddest thing that you see

is the shell of a person staring

44:56.397 --> 44:57.331
- I do all right.

45:01.235 --> 45:04.939
- You ever think about
just leaving it all behind?

45:06.040 --> 45:09.243
Just leaving it all behind and
running off into the sunset?

45:10.878 --> 45:12.112
- You mean sunrise?

45:13.280 --> 45:14.782
- Same difference.

45:19.688 --> 45:20.788
- Yeah.

45:22.691 --> 45:24.158

45:56.323 --> 45:57.224

45:59.026 --> 46:01.895
- It looks closed. What's in there?

46:02.896 --> 46:04.164
- It's not important.

46:09.336 --> 46:11.005
- Do you want me to come down with you?

46:32.826 --> 46:35.029
(crackling)

46:35.129 --> 46:39.933
(suspenseful music)
(muffled banging)

46:40.034 --> 46:41.703
(glass shattering)

46:41.802 --> 46:43.370
(phone buzzing)

46:43.470 --> 46:46.440
(Morgan chuckles)

46:48.242 --> 46:49.143
- Hello.

46:51.078 --> 46:54.281
Oh my God. Don't tell
me you're still driving.

46:54.381 --> 46:55.182
Why am I even surprised?

46:55.282 --> 46:57.084
I'm the one that kept feeding you coffee

46:57.184 --> 46:58.653
(sighs) I'm bored outta my mind.

46:58.753 --> 47:02.456
So when are you gonna come visit me?

47:02.557 --> 47:03.957
I could use the company.

47:06.827 --> 47:12.066
(muffled banging)
(traffic whirring)

47:13.735 --> 47:16.671
(glass shattering)

47:16.771 --> 47:19.006
(crackling)

47:19.106 --> 47:21.275
(knocks on trunk)

47:21.375 --> 47:23.611
(trunk opens)

47:23.712 --> 47:25.346
(object thuds)

47:25.446 --> 47:28.215
(trunk closes)

47:28.916 --> 47:30.451
- Let's go!

47:30.552 --> 47:33.555
(engine starting)

47:33.655 --> 47:34.955
(Cara sighs)

47:35.055 --> 47:38.158
(soft jazz music)

47:41.261 --> 47:46.501
(Cara sighing)
(siren wailing)

47:49.303 --> 47:51.506
- So what's in that duffel?

47:52.807 --> 47:56.377
(Cara breathes heavily)

47:57.411 --> 47:58.312
Huh?

47:59.547 --> 48:02.249
(Cara exhales)

48:08.489 --> 48:13.927
(suspenseful music)
(engine rumbling)

48:17.732 --> 48:20.968
(tires screeching)

48:23.036 --> 48:27.341
- [Boss] They save vengeance
rides a swift horse.

48:28.275 --> 48:30.612
That's why I need you to be faster.

49:49.022 --> 49:52.426
(hard rock music)

49:52.527 --> 49:55.229
(sensor beeps)

50:06.708 --> 50:09.476
(sensor beeps)

50:12.312 --> 50:13.413
- Dave.

50:13.515 --> 50:14.782
What's going on, buddy?
- Oh, hey.

50:14.883 --> 50:17.084
(both chuckle)

50:17.184 --> 50:18.285
Dude, you're never gonna believe this.

50:18.385 --> 50:20.989
I'm here with these super hot models.

50:21.088 --> 50:22.222
There's like three of them.

50:22.322 --> 50:23.925
You know like big actual models.

50:24.024 --> 50:29.062
And they're wasted, like
having a real wild time.

50:29.263 --> 50:31.431
Like if I play my cards
right, maybe later on,

50:31.533 --> 50:33.835
I can get 'em to my
invite to the after party

50:33.935 --> 50:36.571
at the hotel room, if you get my drift.

50:37.672 --> 50:38.773
Hi.
- Hi.

50:40.508 --> 50:41.475
- Oh, you...

50:42.442 --> 50:45.078
- Yeah. Yeah, we're together.

50:47.080 --> 50:48.750
I'm Cara.
- Pleased to meet you.

50:48.850 --> 50:49.951
I'm Frank.

50:50.050 --> 50:51.686
- Nice to meet you too, Frank.

50:53.186 --> 50:55.222
Do you drive a taxi also?
- Oh, yeah.

50:55.322 --> 50:59.393
Actually I've, uh, it's been
almost 20 years now, actually.

50:59.493 --> 51:00.795
It's a grind, but I love it.

51:00.895 --> 51:03.698
You get to meet all sorts
of interesting people

51:03.798 --> 51:05.332
and I'm a people person.
- Mm.

51:05.432 --> 51:08.201
- You know, like, uh, I'm very likable.

51:08.870 --> 51:10.103
- Right.
- I'm a smart guy.

51:10.203 --> 51:12.072
Like I, I could do stuff.

51:12.172 --> 51:13.407
Other things like, you know,

51:13.508 --> 51:15.910
make maybe a little more
money or whatever, you know,

51:16.010 --> 51:21.081
but, um, yeah, I wouldn't
trade this for, for the world.

51:21.181 --> 51:23.083
(chuckles) I'm gonna die in my taxi.

51:23.183 --> 51:24.586
(all chuckle)
Right behind the,

51:24.686 --> 51:26.921
right behind the wheel.
(Cara laughs)

51:27.021 --> 51:28.590
You know the Bukoswki quote?

51:29.389 --> 51:31.358
"Find what you love and let it kill you.

51:31.458 --> 51:33.360
- Oh yeah.
- You know, that's me.

51:33.460 --> 51:34.662
- That's good.
- Yeah, yeah.

51:34.762 --> 51:38.833
- Hey, where are you?
- Ooh, did you hear that?

51:38.933 --> 51:41.435
They need me. (chuckles)

51:41.536 --> 51:44.104
It's nice meeting you.
- You too.

51:44.204 --> 51:45.339
- Go easy on him.

51:45.439 --> 51:48.308
You know, I know he likes to look all,

51:48.408 --> 51:49.811
you know, tough and stuff.

51:49.911 --> 51:51.211
Like some sort of brooding badass,

51:51.311 --> 51:53.815
but, um, he's a softy.

51:53.915 --> 51:56.216
He's like the nicest, most gentle man

51:56.316 --> 51:57.819
you're ever gonna meet.

51:57.919 --> 52:00.420
Swear to God. (chuckles)

52:01.089 --> 52:02.590
Oh.
(Cara chuckles)

52:02.690 --> 52:03.591
- [Woman] Hey!

52:03.691 --> 52:05.627
(women chattering)
(Cara chuckles)

52:05.727 --> 52:08.730
(soft country music)

52:08.830 --> 52:11.099
(traffic whirring)

52:11.198 --> 52:13.433
(upbeat rock music)

52:13.534 --> 52:16.004
(door opens)

52:16.104 --> 52:18.640
- Hey, is there a bathroom here?

52:18.740 --> 52:21.274
- I'm actually not suppose...
(door opens)

52:21.375 --> 52:22.944
It's, it's in the back. Just go for it.

52:23.044 --> 52:25.647
- Okay.
(door closes)

52:25.747 --> 52:26.648
- Hey.

52:28.482 --> 52:29.383
- Hi.

52:30.283 --> 52:32.386
I didn't know if you were still up or...

52:32.486 --> 52:33.387
- Yeah.

52:36.356 --> 52:37.925
- Was she with you?
- Yeah.

52:41.261 --> 52:43.798
- You gonna tell me who she is? (chuckle

52:43.898 --> 52:45.198
- Someone I picked up.

52:46.567 --> 52:47.669
- Oh.

52:47.769 --> 52:50.270
(crackling)

52:51.338 --> 52:54.509
(soft rock music)

52:55.308 --> 53:00.548
- What?
(Cara chuckles)

53:13.360 --> 53:15.596
- More coffee?
- Thank you.

53:20.601 --> 53:22.537
- Let me know if you
need anything else, Dave.

53:26.306 --> 53:27.875
- Well, she's really pretty.

53:29.977 --> 53:30.878
What's her story?

53:33.781 --> 53:34.682
- Morgan?

53:35.550 --> 53:37.652
- You got like history or something?

53:38.753 --> 53:39.654
- No, not really.

53:40.655 --> 53:41.689
- You like her?

53:43.356 --> 53:44.792
- It's not like that.

53:44.892 --> 53:46.027
- Then what's it like?

53:46.127 --> 53:48.529
- Well, I come here regularly
and she works most nights.

53:48.629 --> 53:49.564
- Oh, I think you like her.

53:49.664 --> 53:50.932
And I think she likes you too.

53:51.032 --> 53:52.967
I'm a pretty good judge of character.

53:53.901 --> 53:55.002
- By what metric?

53:55.103 --> 53:57.071
- By every metric.

53:57.171 --> 53:58.840
The way you guys just looked at each oth

53:58.940 --> 54:00.474
when she refilled your coffee.

54:00.575 --> 54:02.309
- Oh. What way was that?

54:02.409 --> 54:04.011
- All dreamily and shit.

54:05.412 --> 54:06.981
She's single. Right?

54:08.182 --> 54:10.918
- Kind of. She's got an ex-husband.

54:11.819 --> 54:13.286
- Okay. And?

54:14.655 --> 54:16.958
- It's complicated.
- What's complicated?

54:23.263 --> 54:24.532
- There is a kid.

54:24.632 --> 54:27.201
So even if I was
interested, which I'm not-

54:27.300 --> 54:28.603
- Which you are.

54:33.808 --> 54:36.944
Look, if you really want
something, you gotta go for it.

54:39.180 --> 54:41.215
- Is that what you do?

54:41.314 --> 54:42.650
Just go for it?

54:44.284 --> 54:46.921
(Dave sighs)

54:48.589 --> 54:50.858
I need to use the restroom.

54:50.958 --> 54:52.160
(Cara chuckles)

54:52.260 --> 54:55.428
(soft rock music)

55:01.803 --> 55:04.272
- Hi.
- What can I get for you?

55:04.371 --> 55:06.007
- Dave tells me you and
him have known each other

55:06.107 --> 55:07.374
for a while now.

55:08.042 --> 55:08.943
- That's right.

55:09.844 --> 55:13.014
- Well sit down. I wanna talk to you.

55:18.920 --> 55:22.757
So, are you guys close?

55:26.326 --> 55:27.762
- I guess you could say that.

55:27.862 --> 55:30.998
- Do you ever do anything outside of her

55:33.333 --> 55:35.468
- Not really, no.
- Why not?

55:36.237 --> 55:38.739
- We don't make time to, I guess.

55:38.840 --> 55:41.809
(soft rock music)

55:52.620 --> 55:54.487
- Dave tells me you have a kid.

55:55.156 --> 55:58.425
- Wow. That is way too personal.

55:59.594 --> 56:02.063
Who are you, exactly?
- Cara.

56:02.163 --> 56:03.965
It's really nice to meet you, Morgan.

56:04.065 --> 56:08.202
- (chuckles) Okay, so Dave,
he picked you up from...

56:08.302 --> 56:09.537
- My motel room.

56:09.637 --> 56:11.839
- And he's taking you...
- On a drive.

56:13.908 --> 56:16.644
- On a drive where?
- Oh, just a drive.

56:18.713 --> 56:22.049
- Right. So why are you here?

56:22.149 --> 56:23.551
- I got hungry.

56:27.288 --> 56:30.057
(Morgan sighs)

56:32.593 --> 56:35.428
You know, I was thinking Dave,

56:35.529 --> 56:37.565
we should do something fun.

56:39.200 --> 56:40.467
- Like what?

56:40.568 --> 56:43.704
- I don't know. Something different.

56:46.807 --> 56:50.077
You're from around here. Any suggestions

56:50.177 --> 56:52.412
- Hmm. No.

56:53.347 --> 56:56.317
- No? Nothing comes to mind?

56:56.984 --> 57:00.321
- You know at this hour your
options are pretty limited.

57:00.420 --> 57:01.722
- Right.

57:01.822 --> 57:03.925
Okay, well in that case,
then maybe we should

57:04.025 --> 57:07.962
just go back to my hotel
room and hang out there.

57:08.930 --> 57:09.864
What do you think?

57:17.437 --> 57:19.941
- You know what? I think I just the thin

57:24.444 --> 57:27.615
(paper crinkling)

57:29.984 --> 57:32.219
It's, um, it's starting pretty soon.

57:32.320 --> 57:33.587
So if you wanna make it,

57:33.688 --> 57:35.189
you better leave right now.

57:36.991 --> 57:38.092
- Good to know.

57:38.192 --> 57:41.162
(soft blues music)

57:42.730 --> 57:46.100
(soft dramatic music)

58:11.025 --> 58:13.661
(eerie music)

59:02.710 --> 59:05.679
(intense music)

01:00:04.438 --> 01:00:06.541
- What is this place?

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.808
- I don't know.

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:13.914
Something about it feels kind of familia

01:00:20.522 --> 01:00:22.389
- What happened back there?

01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:23.390
- Back where?

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.629
(Cara chuckles)

01:00:28.729 --> 01:00:30.731
- You know what I'm talking about.

01:00:32.633 --> 01:00:33.834
- Nothing happened.

01:00:35.636 --> 01:00:37.404
- Didn't look like nothing.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.409
(sword scrapes)

01:01:05.799 --> 01:01:08.435
(tape clacks)

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:12.907
(soft blues music)

01:01:24.752 --> 01:01:26.053
- I like you.

01:01:31.725 --> 01:01:33.260
- I like you too.

01:01:37.898 --> 01:01:40.000
- Well, what do we do?

01:01:46.907 --> 01:01:48.342
- I don't know.

01:01:56.850 --> 01:02:01.121
- Well, what happens when the night ends

01:02:06.528 --> 01:02:09.029
- We could exchange numbers.

01:02:16.203 --> 01:02:19.773
- Are you somebody that
believes in happily ever after?

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:23.811
It's a nice sentiment, isn't it?

01:02:27.682 --> 01:02:30.184
Happily ever after.

01:02:35.923 --> 01:02:39.460
Imagine if we'd met under
different circumstances.

01:02:40.662 --> 01:02:41.762
Do you think...

01:02:44.465 --> 01:02:47.101
Do you think maybe we
could have worked out?

01:02:48.603 --> 01:02:49.504
- I think so.

01:02:57.278 --> 01:03:00.314
- Then I wish I'd met
you in a different life.

01:03:00.414 --> 01:03:03.384
(slow blues music)

01:03:07.722 --> 01:03:11.091
(soft dramatic music)

01:04:09.751 --> 01:04:13.153
(soft dramatic music)

01:04:27.067 --> 01:04:29.370
- [Dave] Well, that's it.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.408
- [Cara] One last game.

01:04:37.679 --> 01:04:40.648
One final bit of unfinished business.

01:04:47.622 --> 01:04:49.657
- [Dave] And after that?

01:04:54.428 --> 01:04:56.130
- [Cara] Who knows?

01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:10.077
(crackling)

01:05:10.177 --> 01:05:13.313
(traffic whirring)

01:05:13.414 --> 01:05:14.549
(door closes)

01:05:14.649 --> 01:05:17.418
(siren wailing)

01:05:27.629 --> 01:05:30.665
(footsteps tapping)

01:06:08.168 --> 01:06:11.271
(engine rumbling)

01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:20.180
(tires screeching)

01:06:22.584 --> 01:06:25.219
(Lenny sighs)

01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:30.357
(intense music)

01:08:06.554 --> 01:08:09.323
(sword slicing)

01:08:10.858 --> 01:08:13.360
(crackling)

01:08:31.946 --> 01:08:35.448
(door opens and closes)

01:08:38.251 --> 01:08:41.254
(door opens)
(siren wailing)

01:08:41.354 --> 01:08:43.658
You can set the duffle bag down anywhere

01:08:56.037 --> 01:08:56.970
(Dave sighs)

01:08:57.071 --> 01:08:58.538
Nice socks.

01:09:00.508 --> 01:09:01.441
- Thanks.

01:09:03.443 --> 01:09:05.412
- You wanna take your jacket off?

01:09:23.296 --> 01:09:25.867
(Dave sighs)

01:09:43.383 --> 01:09:44.919
What?
- You have a tattoo

01:09:45.019 --> 01:09:45.920
on your ankle.

01:09:49.823 --> 01:09:50.957
What does it say?

01:09:51.059 --> 01:09:52.859
- It says, "We all die someday."

01:09:59.701 --> 01:10:00.635
You afraid to die?

01:10:12.479 --> 01:10:14.314
- I try not to think about it.

01:10:17.585 --> 01:10:18.485
- Mm.

01:10:19.554 --> 01:10:22.456
I think there are worse
things in life than death.

01:10:27.995 --> 01:10:29.463
I think people only fear death

01:10:29.564 --> 01:10:33.901
because it's seemingly permanent.

01:10:34.802 --> 01:10:38.238
Nobody really knows what
goes on in the afterlife.

01:10:39.741 --> 01:10:44.244
But they're still scared of letting go.

01:10:56.389 --> 01:10:58.826
I need to use the bathroom.

01:11:01.229 --> 01:11:02.864
Don't go anywhere.

01:11:02.964 --> 01:11:06.466
(door opens and closes)

01:11:08.836 --> 01:11:11.539
(Fan whirring)

01:11:14.441 --> 01:11:17.011
(Dave sighs)

01:11:38.866 --> 01:11:41.434
(bag unzips)

01:11:44.739 --> 01:11:47.440
(bag rustling)

01:11:58.953 --> 01:12:01.656
(Dave sighing)

01:12:04.592 --> 01:12:06.294
(toilet flushing)

01:12:06.393 --> 01:12:09.030
(bag zipping)

01:12:11.065 --> 01:12:13.634
(door opens)

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:22.510
(Dave sighing)

01:12:28.983 --> 01:12:29.884
Hey.

01:12:34.622 --> 01:12:36.389
What are you thinking about?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:46.901
- Nothing.

01:12:49.402 --> 01:12:51.038
(Dave sighs)

01:12:51.138 --> 01:12:53.941
- Okay. Well, come here.

01:12:56.944 --> 01:12:59.981
(traffic whirring)

01:13:05.119 --> 01:13:07.622
I think I'm falling for you.

01:13:15.763 --> 01:13:20.768
- Earlier tonight, when I picked you up,

01:13:22.236 --> 01:13:24.672
I asked you where you wanted to go.

01:13:25.506 --> 01:13:28.475
You told me you didn't know.

01:13:32.079 --> 01:13:36.517
I think you knew exactly
where you wanted to go.

01:13:42.556 --> 01:13:44.992
I saw what's in the duffel.

01:13:55.102 --> 01:13:56.537
Why do you have that?

01:13:56.637 --> 01:13:58.339
- I don't want you getting involved.

01:13:58.438 --> 01:13:59.840
- I am already involved.

01:13:59.941 --> 01:14:02.009
- Well that's your choice, isn't it?

01:14:04.078 --> 01:14:06.814
You didn't have to come
down to the bar with me.

01:14:07.648 --> 01:14:10.184
You could have left at any moment.

01:14:10.284 --> 01:14:11.218
Yet here you are.

01:14:17.591 --> 01:14:18.726
So what now?

01:14:20.795 --> 01:14:22.229
Where do we go from here?

01:14:35.475 --> 01:14:36.610
Do you trust me?

01:14:37.878 --> 01:14:39.714
- I do.
- Okay, let's go.

01:14:39.814 --> 01:14:41.215
Let's run away together.

01:14:46.787 --> 01:14:48.689
- Where would we go?
- I don't know.

01:14:48.789 --> 01:14:50.024
Anywhere we want, just say the word

01:14:50.124 --> 01:14:51.659
and I'll book the next
two tickets outta here,

01:14:51.759 --> 01:14:53.427
but we gotta leave right now.

01:14:54.261 --> 01:14:56.130
- You're serious.
- I can't stay here, Dave!

01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:57.298
I gotta leave!

01:14:57.398 --> 01:14:59.100
Come with me.
- I can't do that.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:14:59.934
- Why not?

01:15:00.034 --> 01:15:02.336
- I, uh, we only just met each other!

01:15:02.436 --> 01:15:05.539
- So?
- So, this is crazy.

01:15:05.639 --> 01:15:06.741
What if it doesn't work out?

01:15:06.841 --> 01:15:09.844
- What if it does? What
if it does work out?

01:15:11.012 --> 01:15:13.614
What if we can have happily ever after?

01:15:14.448 --> 01:15:16.951
- I don't know.
- What is there to know?

01:15:17.051 --> 01:15:18.219
- Uh...

01:15:18.319 --> 01:15:20.755
- There comes a time in your
life where you're standing

01:15:20.855 --> 01:15:23.090
at a fork in the road
and you're face to face

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:26.360
with the hardest decision
that you'll ever have to make.

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.629
And I've made my decision

01:15:28.729 --> 01:15:30.731
and you can either come with me

01:15:30.831 --> 01:15:33.234
and we could try figure this thing out,

01:15:33.334 --> 01:15:36.170
or we say goodbye to each
other right now forever.

01:15:55.222 --> 01:15:58.659
(soft dramatic music)

01:16:57.218 --> 01:16:59.053
- I've often wondered

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:05.192
how the sun would feel like on my skin.

01:17:09.330 --> 01:17:10.297
Would it burn?

01:17:13.834 --> 01:17:16.804
Or would it feel like moonlight?

01:17:22.376 --> 01:17:24.011
It's been so long.

01:17:27.014 --> 01:17:29.984
I'm sure you can relate, Mr. Taxi Driver

01:17:31.452 --> 01:17:33.087
Night after night,

01:17:34.589 --> 01:17:36.824
driving the familiar streets,

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:41.395
things start to blend.

01:17:43.998 --> 01:17:45.966
Not so clear anymore.

01:17:50.572 --> 01:17:52.840
And it started to wear you down.

01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:59.313
And you ask yourself a question.

01:18:03.117 --> 01:18:04.285
Am I dreaming

01:18:06.253 --> 01:18:07.421
or am I awake?

01:18:11.358 --> 01:18:13.260
- And if I'm dreaming,

01:18:15.963 --> 01:18:17.831
what happens when I wake?

01:18:17.932 --> 01:18:23.170
(soft dramatic music)
(stairs creaking)

01:19:19.728 --> 01:19:22.963
(soft guitar music)

01:21:03.964 --> 01:21:05.432
(taper player clacks)

01:21:05.533 --> 01:21:08.302
(intense music)

01:23:47.529 --> 01:23:50.030
(crackling)

01:23:51.833 --> 01:23:55.603
(film projector clattering)

01:24:02.644 --> 01:24:05.613
(traffic whirring)

01:24:14.989 --> 01:24:17.692
(Dave inhales)

01:24:21.829 --> 01:24:24.732
(engine starting)

01:24:32.239 --> 01:24:34.074
(soft dramatic music)

01:24:34.174 --> 01:24:36.678
(crackling)

01:25:10.778 --> 01:25:13.815
(traffic whirring)

01:25:40.742 --> 01:25:43.343
- You made it personal.

01:25:46.313 --> 01:25:48.482
That was your downfall.

01:25:48.583 --> 01:25:51.686
That's how I knew you were going to fail

01:25:54.088 --> 01:25:58.860
In the end, she was always one step ahea

01:26:03.097 --> 01:26:04.231
Now here we are

01:26:08.168 --> 01:26:09.837
at the end of the line.

01:26:11.973 --> 01:26:13.508
- Where do we go from there?

01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:19.881
- Me, nowhere.

01:26:22.917 --> 01:26:23.818
- And me?

01:26:25.185 --> 01:26:26.353
Where do I go?

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:37.397
- Well, that's for you to decide.

01:26:53.681 --> 01:26:56.383
(coin clinks)

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:58.686
Godspeed, Lenny.

01:26:59.687 --> 01:27:00.722
Godspeed.

01:27:12.265 --> 01:27:15.235
(coin scrapes)

01:27:18.706 --> 01:27:21.475
(intense music)

01:28:01.182 --> 01:28:06.419
(arcade game beeping)
(crackling)

01:28:07.855 --> 01:28:10.825
(traffic whirring)

01:28:19.834 --> 01:28:22.537
(Dave sighing)

01:28:45.293 --> 01:28:47.995
(horn honking)

01:28:51.032 --> 01:28:53.668
(Dave moans)

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:01.408
(Dave gasps)

01:29:04.545 --> 01:29:07.515
(Dave sighing)

01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:24.031
(Dave sighing)

01:29:24.131 --> 01:29:26.968
(faucet running)

01:29:28.302 --> 01:29:31.806
(Dave breathes heavily)

01:30:00.601 --> 01:30:03.905
(envelope crinkling)

01:30:23.391 --> 01:30:26.761
(soft dramatic music)

01:32:14.935 --> 01:32:18.839
(bright electronic music)
