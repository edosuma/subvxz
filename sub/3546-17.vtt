00:01.102 --> 00:02.079
Previously on...

00:02.103 --> 00:04.260
But no adoption agency's
gonna touch us now.

00:04.284 --> 00:08.115
There are ways to get babies,
Carlos. $20,000.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.487
Wheels were put inmotion...
I love you.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.159
Aw, thank you.

00:12.183 --> 00:15.492
I love Mike.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.295
True emotions wererevealed...
Who the hell is Mike?

00:18.319 --> 00:20.467
Perception is reality, Andrew.

00:20.491 --> 00:24.101
My name is Bree,
and I am an alcoholic.

00:24.125 --> 00:28.325
And false pretenses
became a way of life.

00:31.362 --> 00:35.082
Gabrielle solis had always been
a demanding shopper.

00:35.106 --> 00:39.015
Carlos, come on! They're here!

00:39.039 --> 00:41.188
And whatever the purchase,

00:41.212 --> 00:44.682
she always expected
the very best.

00:46.317 --> 00:50.217
Whether it was exotic perfume
shipped over from Paris...

00:51.652 --> 00:56.092
A high fashion gown straight
from a runway in Milan...

00:58.058 --> 01:02.109
Or designer shoes
flown in from Manhattan,

01:02.133 --> 01:03.410
but on this day,

01:03.434 --> 01:07.444
her expectations were
going to be put to the test.

01:07.468 --> 01:11.148
You see, Gabrielle was now
shopping for a baby,

01:11.172 --> 01:13.750
and there was a problem...

01:13.774 --> 01:16.184
With the manufacturer.

01:19.510 --> 01:22.229
Mostly, I just wanna feel
like I'm giving my baby

01:22.253 --> 01:26.167
to people who have what it takes
to be really great parents.

01:26.191 --> 01:28.165
Well, you won't find
another couple

01:28.189 --> 01:30.467
with more love for a child.

01:30.491 --> 01:34.271
Isn't that right, honey? Honey?

01:34.295 --> 01:36.343
Right. Right, uh, lots of love.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.806
Honey, can I talk to you
for a second?

01:39.830 --> 01:42.200
Yeah.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.185
Okay. Okay, look,
we have to find another mother.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.817
Why? Okay, this isn't easy to say,
so I'm just gonna say it,

01:50.841 --> 01:53.820
but have you taken a good look at her? Oh,
my god.

01:53.844 --> 01:55.631
Are you trying to say that
you don't want deana's baby

01:55.655 --> 01:58.195
because she's plain?
No, plain I can handle.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.197
Carlos, since that woman
has walked into our house,

02:00.221 --> 02:01.498
the clocks have stopped working.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.201
No one can predict what
a child is gonna look like.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.573
For all you know, her kid could
end up winning beauty contests.

02:06.597 --> 02:08.275
Withherd.n.a.,

02:08.299 --> 02:10.776
the only thing that kid's gonna
be winning is best in show.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.210
Look, Carlos, I am sorry,
but I want a pretty baby,

02:13.234 --> 02:15.547
so let's find another mother.
Mnh-mnh. I'm not gonna let

02:15.571 --> 02:18.245
your shallow obsession
with looks screw this up.

02:18.269 --> 02:20.347
I want a child... any child.

02:20.371 --> 02:22.849
Fine. Just know
that in a couple of days,

02:22.873 --> 02:24.851
when that thing is born,

02:24.875 --> 02:27.354
and you're gonna have
to cuddle and snuggle up

02:27.378 --> 02:29.426
with something
withthatface on it,

02:29.450 --> 02:31.450
don't come crying to me.

02:37.188 --> 02:38.635
I'm sorry.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.307
Now where were we?

02:40.331 --> 02:42.369
We were just talking about
the custody arrangement

02:42.393 --> 02:43.870
once deana gives birth.

02:43.894 --> 02:45.751
It's usually best
that the mother

02:45.775 --> 02:48.175
doesn't see the child at all.

02:48.199 --> 02:51.248
So as soon as the doctors finish
giving their initial checkup...

02:51.272 --> 02:54.282
♪♪♪

03:01.652 --> 03:04.561
The baby
will be handed over to you.

03:04.585 --> 03:09.636
Yes, Gabrielle had always been
a demanding shopper.

03:09.660 --> 03:11.490
Sorry.

03:12.823 --> 03:17.374
Because she knew
there are some purchases...

03:17.398 --> 03:20.877
That can't be returned.

03:20.901 --> 03:28.901
♪♪♪

04:03.013 --> 04:05.592
At 6:10 the next morning,

04:05.616 --> 04:07.994
deana pruse
went into premature labor

04:08.018 --> 04:10.357
and gave birth
to what would eventually be

04:10.381 --> 04:14.531
an incredibly attractive
baby boy.

04:15.926 --> 04:19.866
At 11:43, Dr. Hanson mills
cut the umbilical cord,

04:19.890 --> 04:24.411
forever separating
mother and child.

04:24.435 --> 04:25.912
At that exact same moment,

04:25.936 --> 04:29.776
Dr. Ron mccready entered
the private room of Susan Mayer

04:29.800 --> 04:34.381
with every intention
of severingtheirconnection.

04:34.405 --> 04:36.623
Hey there. How's it goin'?

04:36.647 --> 04:39.486
Great. I'm about to be released.

04:39.510 --> 04:42.258
Oh, that's terrific. Who's Mike?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.831
I...

04:44.855 --> 04:47.294
Why do you ask?

04:47.318 --> 04:49.296
I don't know. No reason.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.738
Ah, it's just, um...

04:51.762 --> 04:53.740
Just before the operation,

04:53.764 --> 04:56.681
just before you went under,
I said, "I love you,"

04:56.705 --> 04:59.045
and you said, "I love Mike."

04:59.069 --> 05:02.379
I did?

05:02.403 --> 05:06.320
Oh, is that why you haven't been
in to see me since my surgery?

05:06.344 --> 05:08.415
Answer the question.

05:08.439 --> 05:10.709
I don't even know a Mike.

05:12.583 --> 05:15.897
Everyone knows a Mike. Yes,
everyone does know a Mike.

05:15.921 --> 05:18.395
Actually, you're right.
I did know a Mike in college.

05:18.419 --> 05:21.067
We did this play together,
"pippin." It wasn't very good.

05:21.091 --> 05:24.435
Anyways, I never thought of him,
so you shouldn't be accusing me.

05:24.459 --> 05:26.302
I was probably
just hallucinating.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.375
Fine, fine.

05:28.399 --> 05:30.407
So... who's the guy
you're married to?

05:30.431 --> 05:32.579
Damn that nurse hisel!

05:32.603 --> 05:35.817
Or should I say, "who's the guy
you're cheating on?"

05:35.841 --> 05:37.814
Okay, yes, I did remarry my ex,

05:37.838 --> 05:40.447
but it was only because
he has great health insurance.

05:40.471 --> 05:42.449
Did miss blabbermouth
tell you that, too?

05:42.473 --> 05:45.497
You... you committed insurance
fraud? Only in the legal sense.

05:45.521 --> 05:49.025
And I just didn't tell you
because I wanted to protect you.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.027
Susan... okay, you know what?

05:51.051 --> 05:53.860
You should come over to dinner
and meet Karl, and you can see

05:53.884 --> 05:56.368
that there is absolutely
nothing between us.

05:56.392 --> 05:58.705
So wait,
once you're fully recovered

05:58.729 --> 06:00.407
you're gonna divorce him?

06:00.431 --> 06:02.439
Oh, yeah, that's the plan.
I swear.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.473
And you swear that you're not
in love with anyone named Mike?

06:07.468 --> 06:10.138
Sure.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.482
Okay.

06:15.506 --> 06:17.384
Come here.

06:17.408 --> 06:20.548
I believe you.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.860
Next morning,
I woke up in an alley.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.367
My wallet had been stolen.

06:25.391 --> 06:27.964
I was lying in a pool
of my own vomit.

06:27.988 --> 06:31.018
That's when I knew
I'd hit rock bottom.

06:33.624 --> 06:37.504
Okay, who's next?

06:37.528 --> 06:38.528
Bree.

06:40.070 --> 06:43.379
Oh! Um, I couldn't
possibly top that.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.913
Thank you, though.

06:55.185 --> 06:57.524
Hi. Before coming
to these meetings,

06:57.548 --> 07:01.568
I never realized how messy
substance abusers can be.

07:01.592 --> 07:03.570
We usually leave
the doughnut crumbs

07:03.594 --> 07:05.581
for the overeaters anonymous
group that meets after us.

07:05.605 --> 07:07.804
You know, just to mess with 'em.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.576
You're awful.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.178
So... tell me, Bree,
how long have you been sober?

07:12.202 --> 07:14.941
Gosh, um...

07:14.965 --> 07:17.013
I'm not exactly sure.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.816
Oh. Is somebody still drinking?

07:19.840 --> 07:22.549
Now why would you say that?

07:22.573 --> 07:24.556
I've never met an alcoholic yet

07:24.580 --> 07:28.015
who didn't know exactly how long
it'd been since his last drink.

07:30.881 --> 07:34.000
Okay, you got me.

07:34.024 --> 07:36.002
I'm not really an alcoholic.

07:36.026 --> 07:37.604
You don't say.

07:37.628 --> 07:40.106
It's true. I'm coming here
because of my son.

07:40.130 --> 07:43.109
You see, he's... he's trying
to take me to court to become

07:43.133 --> 07:46.617
an emancipated minor, and he's
planning on lying to the judge

07:46.641 --> 07:49.115
and telling him that
I am some sort of dreadful lush.

07:49.139 --> 07:51.618
So I'm coming to these meetings
to give the impression

07:51.642 --> 07:54.626
that I have changed. But
you don't really need to change

07:54.650 --> 07:56.853
because you don't have
a problem with alcohol.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.526
Exactly.

07:59.550 --> 08:01.087
I'll tell you what...

08:01.111 --> 08:03.490
Here's my card.

08:03.514 --> 08:05.497
And if you ever dohave a problem

08:05.521 --> 08:08.464
or you just feel like talking,
give me a call, okay?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.597
I know you think
I'm kidding myself,

08:10.621 --> 08:12.138
but I'm not.

08:12.162 --> 08:14.501
I'm nothing like you people.

08:14.525 --> 08:17.565
I just don't have
a compulsive personality.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.199
Hmm.

08:26.577 --> 08:29.556
Word is out all over town
that you're unhappy at zimms,

08:29.580 --> 08:32.958
so why not jump ship
and come to parcher & Murphy?

08:32.982 --> 08:35.597
I swear, Veronica,
you would fit in so well here.

08:35.621 --> 08:37.594
I do need
to make a change, Lynette,

08:37.618 --> 08:40.226
but the money you're offering...

08:40.250 --> 08:42.227
Yeah, it sucks,
but there are other perks...

08:42.251 --> 08:44.500
The expense account,
the corner office... I don't know.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.508
You're just gonna have to give
me some time to think about it.

08:47.532 --> 08:50.537
Fair enough, fair enough.
Okay, what is your secret?

08:50.561 --> 08:53.009
How can you eat like that
and keep your figure?

08:53.033 --> 08:56.017
It's the breast-feeding.
It burns so many calories.

08:56.041 --> 08:58.885
It's like having a treadmill
strapped to your chest.

08:58.909 --> 09:01.548
I didn't know you had a child.

09:01.572 --> 09:04.599
Yes, my son Donovan.
He's the love of my life.

09:04.623 --> 09:06.252
Really, Veronica?

09:06.276 --> 09:08.925
Well, you know, there's another
perk that I just thought of.

09:12.723 --> 09:16.302
Oh, my gosh, this is fantastic!

09:16.326 --> 09:18.304
They don't have
day care at zimms.

09:18.328 --> 09:19.806
How can they not?

09:19.830 --> 09:22.809
For working parents like
you and me, it's a necessity.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.571
So is the pot getting sweeter?

09:24.595 --> 09:26.873
Would people here be cool
about my breast-feeding Donovan?

09:26.897 --> 09:29.145
The guys at zimms
were real jerks about that.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.648
Parcher & Murphy
is completely mother-friendly.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.819
No one would say a word.

09:32.843 --> 09:34.303
Oh!

09:36.146 --> 09:37.954
What the heck, I'm in.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.186
Yeah? Well, that's fantastic!

09:40.210 --> 09:42.759
Oh, my god,
whose kids are those?

09:45.886 --> 09:48.034
I have absolutely no idea.

09:48.058 --> 09:50.718
Let's go hammer
out the details. Okay.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.300
Mm. Ooh.

09:54.324 --> 09:56.811
These can't be
our only choices, Mr. Beale.

09:56.835 --> 09:58.775
I mean, comeon.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.807
Each girl is uglier
than the next.

10:00.831 --> 10:02.809
Look, finding a gorgeous
pregnant woman who's willing

10:02.833 --> 10:05.311
to give her baby to a couple
with a criminal record

10:05.335 --> 10:08.314
isn't exactly a walk in the park. I
don't care if it's a walk in the sewer.

10:08.338 --> 10:10.316
We are hemorrhaging money
into your bank account,

10:10.340 --> 10:13.660
and I expect to see results. You know,
Mrs. Solis,

10:13.684 --> 10:15.901
you can catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.

10:15.925 --> 10:17.894
If I wanted to catch flies,

10:17.918 --> 10:20.797
all I would have to do
is call up one of these girls.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.799
Trust me,
the flies would follow.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.740
Excuse me,
sir, there's a Libby Collins here for you.

10:25.764 --> 10:29.375
I'll be right out there.
Uh, I took the Liberty

10:29.399 --> 10:31.377
of inviting this girl
down here to meet you.

10:31.401 --> 10:33.880
Now I wouldn't exactly say
she's aqualityhuman being,

10:33.904 --> 10:35.381
but she is attractive.

10:35.405 --> 10:39.015
If you don't respond to her,
I'm afraid I'm out of ideas.

10:40.871 --> 10:43.219
He's going to dump us as clients

10:43.243 --> 10:45.196
if you don't stop
being so damn picky.

10:45.220 --> 10:47.193
We're gonna
have to stare at this face

10:47.217 --> 10:48.695
for the next 18 years.

10:48.719 --> 10:51.728
I don't think now
is the time to skimp on quality.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.700
Gabrielle, Carlos...

10:53.724 --> 10:56.234
I'd like you to meet Libby.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.874
Well, now, this I can work with.

11:13.844 --> 11:15.121
So getting pregnant

11:15.145 --> 11:17.684
was the worst thing that
could've ever happened to me,

11:17.708 --> 11:20.787
'cause I went into debt
and I had to stop performing.

11:20.811 --> 11:23.259
Libby's a pole dancer
in a strip club.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.761
Oh!

11:24.785 --> 11:27.163
Wow, that... that sounds
like interesting work.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.767
You'd think so,
but it gets old quickly.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.169
My big dream
is to become a choreographer.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.146
Really? Yeah. I made
up this one move.

11:35.170 --> 11:37.143
It's called
"the serpent's tongue,"

11:37.167 --> 11:40.146
and all the girls at the club
are doing it now. It's so cool.

11:40.170 --> 11:42.178
If I had a pole
I could show you.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.959
Well, we'll have to go down
to the club and check that out.

11:44.983 --> 11:48.755
We'll make a night of it.
Yeah, we'll do that.

11:48.779 --> 11:51.157
So, Libby, who's the father?

11:51.181 --> 11:52.859
Honesty, I don't know.

11:52.883 --> 11:55.130
I mean, there's a lot of guys
who come into the club,

11:55.154 --> 11:57.223
and they all buy me drinks,

11:57.247 --> 12:00.767
and sometimes I get a little bit
more friendly than I intend to.

12:00.791 --> 12:02.729
I hope you don't think
I'm a slut.

12:02.753 --> 12:03.870
No!

12:03.894 --> 12:05.881
No. No, actually,
all we think about

12:05.905 --> 12:09.405
when we look at you
is how pretty you are.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.407
Well, I've heard enough,
Mr. Beale.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.280
If Libby here likes us as much
as much as we like her,

12:14.304 --> 12:17.418
we should just go ahead
and move to adopt her baby girl.

12:17.442 --> 12:20.947
First, we should probably talk
about how much money I want.

12:20.971 --> 12:23.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.901
Nobody's buying a baby here.
That's illegal.

12:25.925 --> 12:28.324
Money can never exchange hands.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.326
Libby, you'll make a list
of your expenses,

12:30.350 --> 12:32.158
and the solises here will pay.

12:32.182 --> 12:34.861
Oh, but can't they also
buy me gifts?

12:34.885 --> 12:36.933
I knew this one girl who gave up
her baby, and she got a Harley.

12:36.957 --> 12:41.267
Well, I don't know that we can
afford a Harley, but I'm sure

12:41.291 --> 12:44.510
we'll find some way
to express our gratitude.

12:44.534 --> 12:46.913
Okay.

12:46.937 --> 12:47.974
Whatever.

12:47.998 --> 12:50.777
Well, my lunch break is over,

12:50.801 --> 12:53.419
so I have to get back
to the club.

12:53.443 --> 12:56.327
Till I get rid of this kid,
they got me slinging drinks.

12:56.351 --> 12:59.856
It was really nice to meet you,
Mr. and mrs.Soulless.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.888
Oh, it's actually
pronouncedsolis.

13:01.912 --> 13:02.789
Sorry.

13:02.813 --> 13:04.230
So what kind of name is that?

13:04.254 --> 13:05.962
Uh, it's Mexican.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.994
Both our families
come from Guadalajara.

13:08.018 --> 13:10.496
Huh.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.168
I figured you were Italian.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.872
Nope. Latino. Proud of it.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.826
Good for you.

13:23.874 --> 13:26.782
Wow, she's... gorgeous.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.356
Yeah. My little girl's gonna
inherit some wonderful genes.

13:30.380 --> 13:32.358
Is this Libby's real hair color?

13:32.382 --> 13:33.860
Yes, it's all natural,

13:33.884 --> 13:35.797
from her straight teeth
to her "c" cup.

13:35.821 --> 13:38.294
And I know she's athletic
because she's a pole dancer,

13:38.318 --> 13:39.966
so I really hope

13:39.990 --> 13:42.298
that my little girl
inherits that as well.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.539
No, the athletic gene,
not the pole dancing gene.

13:47.227 --> 13:50.036
Susie, baby?

13:50.060 --> 13:52.979
Oh, I got your call, uh...
I thought I'd stop by.

13:53.003 --> 13:54.986
I didn't realize
you had company. Hello, ladies.

13:55.010 --> 13:57.813
Um, we'll just be a second.
Just wheel me.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.115
Be right back.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.447
Just be a second.

14:01.471 --> 14:03.819
Did he just call her "baby"?

14:03.843 --> 14:05.957
Yeah. When did they
stop hating each other?

14:05.981 --> 14:07.994
I need you to ditch Edie
tomorrow night

14:08.018 --> 14:10.056
and have dinner
with Dr. Ron and me.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.198
Now why would I do that?

14:12.222 --> 14:14.200
Well, for starters, because you
banged your secretary,

14:14.224 --> 14:16.908
and you owe me
for the rest of your life.

14:16.932 --> 14:18.204
I'll bring the wine.

14:18.228 --> 14:20.206
Well, you know,
before Mike came along,

14:20.230 --> 14:23.509
I always just assumed
they'd get back together. Why?

14:23.533 --> 14:25.947
I thought they always annoyed
the heck out of each other.

14:25.971 --> 14:27.944
You didn't know them
during the good times.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.917
I mean, there was such a spark
between them, so much passion.

14:30.941 --> 14:33.880
They would always
make each other laugh.

14:33.904 --> 14:36.327
You actually told Dr. Ron
that you still love Mike?

14:36.351 --> 14:39.185
Okay, will you shut up?
It's not funny. I was drugged.

14:39.209 --> 14:40.887
Right. Sorry, sorry.

14:40.911 --> 14:43.029
So how'd you
get out of that one?

14:43.053 --> 14:45.940
I lied and I told him
I didn't know a Mike.

14:45.964 --> 14:48.965
Everyone knows a Mike.
I am aware of that.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.367
So why didn't you just...
Because I panicked, okay?

14:51.391 --> 14:54.000
Dr. Ron hadn't come in
to see me since the operation

14:54.024 --> 14:56.007
and I was feeling
insecure and...

14:56.031 --> 14:59.005
I just didn't
feel like the truth

14:59.029 --> 15:01.247
was a luxury I could afford.

15:01.271 --> 15:03.609
Yes, go ahead.
You may resume laughing.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.955
Uh...

15:08.979 --> 15:12.079
Ladies, always a pleasure.
And you, I'll see you tomorrow.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.525
What?

15:19.549 --> 15:21.527
This is just
a preliminary sketch,

15:21.551 --> 15:23.529
but you see what
I'm thinking of?

15:23.553 --> 15:26.537
I love it. I just love it.
Let get a copy to ed.

15:26.561 --> 15:29.135
Oh,
shoot, I gotta take this one.

15:29.159 --> 15:32.038
I'm sorry. It's Tom. That's okay.
My nanny is here with my son.

15:32.062 --> 15:35.046
I need to go feed him anyway.
Perfect! Take your time.

15:35.070 --> 15:36.943
Hey, honey.
How's the big apple treating ya?

15:36.967 --> 15:41.047
Good. Did those, uh,
snooty clients like your pitch?

15:41.071 --> 15:43.189
Well, that's perfect.

15:43.213 --> 15:45.992
Excellent.

15:46.016 --> 15:47.946
Uh-huh.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.959
Um, I'm...

15:52.983 --> 15:56.693
I'm, um... I'm gonna have...
I'm gonna call you back.

16:23.613 --> 16:26.093
Oh, my god!

16:28.118 --> 16:30.366
Hello there!

16:30.390 --> 16:33.339
I thought you and your friend
might like some snacks.

16:33.363 --> 16:36.407
He's my lawyer, and this is
privileged communication,

16:36.431 --> 16:39.305
so get out. Andrew,
there's no need to be rude.

16:39.329 --> 16:42.008
This is very kind of you,
Mrs. Van De Kamp.

16:42.032 --> 16:44.310
Well, I'm still appalled
that you're helping my son

16:44.334 --> 16:46.587
with this ridiculous
emancipation scheme,

16:46.611 --> 16:49.485
but you are a guest in my house,
and guests get sandwiches.

16:49.509 --> 16:53.059
You know, if you'd let me go
to his office, you wouldn't have

16:53.083 --> 16:57.127
to pretend to be nice to him. Andrew,
there may be a judge out there

16:57.151 --> 16:58.664
stupid enough to emancipate you,

16:58.688 --> 17:01.327
but until you find him,
I retain all my parental rights,

17:01.351 --> 17:05.108
one of which is to ground your
sorry behind until kingdom come.

17:05.132 --> 17:08.574
Mr. Bormanis,
nice to see you again.

17:08.598 --> 17:11.598
And, um, please don't
get crumbs on my carpet.

17:13.563 --> 17:15.546
You have got
to get me out of here.

17:15.569 --> 17:17.542
That bitch is driving me crazy.

17:17.567 --> 17:19.545
This case is not a slam dunk.

17:19.569 --> 17:21.587
Her drinking was supposed
to be our silver bullet,

17:21.611 --> 17:24.349
but since she joined a.A...
We've gotta do something,

17:24.374 --> 17:27.228
because if she wins,
she's gonna own me. My advice?

17:27.252 --> 17:30.226
Convince her it's in her
best interest to let you go.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.429
You don't wanna see the
inside of a courtroom. Why?

17:33.453 --> 17:36.762
In family court,
appearance means everything.

17:36.786 --> 17:40.366
If she came off abusive
or stoned or even uncaring,

17:40.390 --> 17:42.338
we'd be in good shape.

17:42.362 --> 17:45.149
But if there's one thing
your mom understands...

17:45.173 --> 17:47.535
It's presentation.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.147
Mmm.

17:55.245 --> 17:56.752
Can I borrow $50?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.106
Purse.

18:03.253 --> 18:05.336
Why do you want so much money?

18:05.360 --> 18:08.694
I'm 19. Sometimes I need money.
Do I have to be interrogated?

18:08.718 --> 18:10.666
You do if you want
a dime out of me.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.668
What's it for?

18:12.692 --> 18:14.670
Danielle's having her birthday
next week.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.651
I just wanna be sure
I can get her a decent present.

18:17.675 --> 18:20.546
Write her a poem. It's free.

18:23.703 --> 18:27.183
Is there
something else you want?

18:27.207 --> 18:29.715
Do you think
I like to beg for money?

18:29.739 --> 18:32.218
I do this because
you won't let me get a job.

18:32.242 --> 18:34.220
Looking after your brother
isa full-time job

18:34.244 --> 18:37.228
for both of us,
and you know that. Well, screw him!

18:37.252 --> 18:39.365
Matthew! No, I'm serious,
mom, because we have both

18:39.389 --> 18:42.228
put our entire lives on hold,
and for what?

18:42.252 --> 18:45.100
It's been almost a year and he hasn't
gotten any better. I see him improving!

18:45.124 --> 18:48.174
That's because you see
what you wanna see!

18:48.198 --> 18:50.236
It is time to put him away, mom.

18:50.260 --> 18:53.279
Just let some professionals
take care of him.

18:53.303 --> 18:57.213
We wouldn't have to move.
We could have our lives back.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.667
What's wrong?

19:02.242 --> 19:03.119
You fighting?

19:03.143 --> 19:05.291
No, sweetie.

19:05.315 --> 19:08.324
Matthew's friend Danielle
has a birthday coming up.

19:08.348 --> 19:11.457
We were just talking about
what gift to give her.

19:11.481 --> 19:13.799
Well, I was thinking jewelry...

19:13.823 --> 19:15.833
So 50 bucks should do it.

19:19.189 --> 19:22.229
Why not $20?
You don't wanna spoil her.

19:36.506 --> 19:39.825
On page 6 is an example of
the new print ad. Check it out.

19:39.849 --> 19:41.657
I'm thirsty.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.359
Oh, shh, honey,
everyone's working.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.523
I'm sorry.
This will just take a sec.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.369
Is it just me,
or is that bizarre?

19:53.393 --> 19:56.203
It's bizarre. Totally bizarre.

19:59.899 --> 20:03.349
We gotta make her stop this. Hey,
hey, don't get me wrong.

20:03.373 --> 20:05.316
I find that as bizarre
as you guys do.

20:05.340 --> 20:08.854
But right now this firm needs
Veronica more than she needs us.

20:08.878 --> 20:11.657
Telling a mother how to raise
her kids is an act of war.

20:11.681 --> 20:14.320
We will lose her. The
kid is 5. It's disgusting!

20:14.344 --> 20:16.327
Yeah, well, we'll just ask her

20:16.351 --> 20:19.365
to keep the blinds
always drawn when she nurses.

20:19.389 --> 20:22.368
We'll still know what's going
on in there. It's a distraction.

20:22.392 --> 20:24.370
And god forbid
a client sees her.

20:24.394 --> 20:27.304
Okay, so who's gonna tell her?

20:32.932 --> 20:35.581
You're a woman.
It's easier for you

20:35.605 --> 20:38.213
to talk to her about
milk and boobs and stuff.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.646
No! No, uh, please,
don't make me do it.

20:40.670 --> 20:42.217
Why don't you have
Jerry tell her?

20:42.241 --> 20:45.220
I made a pass at her yesterday.
It'd be weird.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.231
You could do it
without offending her.

20:47.255 --> 20:50.416
Come on, Lynette.
Take one for the team.

20:54.624 --> 20:59.405
Okay. But for the record,
the team is made up of wimps.

20:59.429 --> 21:02.308
Well, the team's aware of that
and accepts your loathing.

21:05.465 --> 21:09.315
Yeah? Hi. No. No, no.

21:09.339 --> 21:13.519
We were just out buying some
stuff for the baby. What's up?

21:13.543 --> 21:15.351
Seriously?

21:15.375 --> 21:17.723
Okay.

21:17.747 --> 21:19.407
Thanks for calling.

21:21.311 --> 21:23.689
What is it?

21:23.713 --> 21:26.700
That was our lawyer.
Libby rejected us as parents.

21:26.724 --> 21:28.964
Why? Because we're Mexican.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.397
What?! Why, i...
That's discrimination.

21:31.421 --> 21:34.570
It's illegal. We could have
her arrested. It's her baby.

21:34.594 --> 21:37.351
She can do whatever the hell
she wants to with it.

21:37.375 --> 21:38.474
Damn it.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.406
No! No, you don't just
toss people aside

21:40.430 --> 21:43.409
because of the color of their skin.
We tossed those birth mothers aside

21:43.433 --> 21:46.387
because of their appearance. Well,
that's different.

21:46.411 --> 21:48.454
Why? Because I've
read the constitution,

21:48.478 --> 21:50.486
and it does not
protect ugly people.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.488
Let's not fight about it.
It's over.

21:52.512 --> 21:55.326
Let's just move on to the next one. No. No,
no, no.

21:55.350 --> 21:58.345
I wantthatwoman's baby,
and I'm gonna get it.

22:00.590 --> 22:03.469
And just how are you
gonna go about doing that?

22:03.493 --> 22:05.910
Well, first of all, I'm gonna
show her one of our tax returns.

22:05.934 --> 22:07.903
Once she sees
how much money we have,

22:07.927 --> 22:10.857
I have a hunch we're gonna
look a whole lot whiter.

22:12.602 --> 22:15.411
Hey, Veronica. Hi, Donovan!

22:15.435 --> 22:19.485
My, he's getting big.
How old is he?

22:19.509 --> 22:20.646
He just turned 5.

22:20.670 --> 22:23.349
Oh, wow,
he's such a big boy. Yeah.

22:23.373 --> 22:25.351
Hey, you know,

22:25.375 --> 22:27.523
breast-feeding on this schedule
must be a real hassle.

22:27.547 --> 22:30.526
I remember I used to express
my milk into a bottle.

22:30.550 --> 22:33.529
Made my life so much easier.

22:33.553 --> 22:36.462
Is there a problem, Lynette?

22:36.486 --> 22:41.467
The people in this office
feel a little...

22:41.491 --> 22:42.838
Concerned...

22:42.862 --> 22:48.444
That you're nursing a boy
of Donovan's age.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.446
Do they know breast milk
boosts the immune system,

22:50.470 --> 22:52.978
it's loaded with vitamins,
and in the third world,

22:53.002 --> 22:56.382
it's not unusual to nurse babies
up to the age of 6?

22:56.406 --> 22:58.484
Yeah, well, in the third world,
they don't have juice boxes.

22:58.508 --> 23:00.426
This is Donovan's decision.

23:00.450 --> 23:03.429
He will tell me when
he's ready to stop nursing.

23:03.453 --> 23:06.540
Come on, baby birds
don't jump out of the nest.

23:06.564 --> 23:08.694
They need to be pushed.

23:08.718 --> 23:10.396
Did you also know

23:10.420 --> 23:13.799
that breast milk is thought
to raise I.Q. Scores?

23:20.470 --> 23:23.709
Yeah, maybe if you had
weaned your kids a bit later,

23:23.733 --> 23:25.551
they'd be more civilized.

23:25.575 --> 23:27.653
Ouch.

23:27.677 --> 23:30.155
I will not be judged
by you or anyone else,

23:30.179 --> 23:32.418
and if people don't like
my breast-feeding,

23:32.442 --> 23:34.812
they can talk to my lawyer.

23:37.647 --> 23:39.625
And then
she took the salad bowl...

23:39.649 --> 23:40.766
Mm-hmm?

23:40.790 --> 23:42.768
Put it on the floor and said,

23:42.792 --> 23:45.779
"if you wanna act like a pig,
you can eat like a pig."

23:49.529 --> 23:52.137
You know, I never thought
I'd have such a good time

23:52.161 --> 23:54.139
hanging out with my girlfriend
and her husband.

23:54.163 --> 23:56.742
Yeah, well, believe me,
behind all the laughs,

23:56.766 --> 23:58.784
there's still plenty of bitterness
and resentment. Oh, really?

23:58.808 --> 24:01.487
Yeah. Hey,
what do you say you and I clear the table

24:01.511 --> 24:03.849
and bring on dessert?
No, no. I got it, I got it.

24:03.873 --> 24:05.856
No, honey,
you're not gonna do anything.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.993
You're in a wheelchair
for a reason, okay?

24:08.017 --> 24:09.995
Why don't you let Karl and I
do the dishes?

24:10.019 --> 24:12.498
All right, but if I catch you
guys in there talking about me,

24:12.522 --> 24:15.060
you're gonna be the one
in a wheelchair. Oh, really?

24:15.084 --> 24:16.602
Yeah. Mmm. Yeah?

24:16.626 --> 24:19.605
Well, I think maybe the dishes
can wait for a second.

24:19.629 --> 24:21.829
Just a second? Yeah,
just a second.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.179
What the hell?

25:04.203 --> 25:06.652
What's the matter?

25:06.676 --> 25:07.653
Aah!

25:07.677 --> 25:09.484
Jeez, ah, we got a leak.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.486
Oh. I'll sop up the water.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.660
Why don't you see go see
the guy across the street?

25:14.684 --> 25:16.671
He's a plumber,
in the gray house.

25:16.695 --> 25:18.964
All right. I'll be right back.

25:18.988 --> 25:21.018
His name's Delfino.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.031
Where's he going?

25:26.055 --> 25:28.503
Oh, we've got a bit
of a plumbing emergency.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.606
So you sent him over to Mike's?

25:30.630 --> 25:32.638
Oh, my god. I am such an idiot!

25:32.662 --> 25:34.910
I wasn't even thinking.
Karl! Oh, god!

25:34.934 --> 25:37.583
There's just so much water here.

25:37.607 --> 25:39.967
What were you thinking? Oh, oh!

25:43.172 --> 25:46.256
Hi, Mr. Delfino? My name's Ron.
My girlfriend is Susan Mayer.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.253
You know,
from across the street?

25:48.277 --> 25:50.055
Yeah, yeah...

25:50.079 --> 25:51.557
I know her.

25:51.581 --> 25:54.529
We've got kind of a burst pipe.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.661
Okay, um...

25:55.685 --> 25:57.532
Come on in while I get my tools.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.286
And you can call me Mike.

26:03.332 --> 26:05.110
Oh! Ugh!

26:05.134 --> 26:06.972
Oh, ah, okay.

26:06.996 --> 26:08.674
I made it.

26:08.698 --> 26:11.717
So... Mike, have you, uh,
have you known Susan long?

26:11.741 --> 26:13.679
A year and a half.

26:13.703 --> 26:15.751
Ah! Ooh!

26:15.775 --> 26:17.252
Didn't she mention we dated?

26:17.276 --> 26:20.776
No, no, she didn't.
She... she didn't.

26:23.813 --> 26:24.890
Oh!

26:26.215 --> 26:29.635
Can you excuse me, please?

26:29.659 --> 26:31.336
That smarts! Aah!

26:35.194 --> 26:36.802
Liar!

26:36.826 --> 26:39.645
I take it you met Mike.
Yeah, I did.

26:39.669 --> 26:41.306
Please, please let me explain.

26:41.330 --> 26:44.680
No, just let go of me. Ohh!

26:44.704 --> 26:46.581
I'm sorry. Okay.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.654
Here, come on, let me help you.

26:48.678 --> 26:52.317
Hey,
get away from her! Are you okay? I'm fine!

26:52.341 --> 26:54.760
What the hell is the matter with you? Hey,
that was an accident!

26:54.784 --> 26:57.027
That didn't look
like an accident.

26:57.051 --> 26:59.665
Okay, Mike, just... it's okay.
Just go home.

26:59.689 --> 27:01.727
Yeah, go home, Mike.

27:01.751 --> 27:05.230
You touch her like that again,
you're gonna be dealing with me.

27:05.254 --> 27:07.141
You might wanna
get out of my face.

27:07.165 --> 27:08.804
Or what?

27:08.828 --> 27:10.698
Okay.

27:16.165 --> 27:18.984
Ron, what are you doing?

27:19.008 --> 27:20.916
Oh, my god!

27:20.940 --> 27:23.719
Guys, stop it. Stop it,
right now! All right, all right.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.752
I can't believe
I wasted my time with you.

27:26.776 --> 27:29.124
You've just been leading me on!

27:29.148 --> 27:31.927
You're obviously
still in love with this guy.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.999
All right, I'm done.
No, Ron, don't go!

27:34.023 --> 27:35.831
Don't call me.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.133
Oh, Ron!

27:38.157 --> 27:39.887
Oh!

27:41.791 --> 27:43.839
Ugh!

27:43.863 --> 27:45.846
What the hell is wrong with you?

27:45.870 --> 27:47.843
I thought he was hurting you.

27:47.867 --> 27:50.876
Well, he wasn't!

27:50.900 --> 27:53.040
And now my boyfriend is gone.

27:55.004 --> 27:57.814
Thank you very much.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.865
♪ Don't cha
wish your girlfriend ♪

28:09.889 --> 28:11.366

28:11.390 --> 28:13.368

28:13.392 --> 28:15.440

28:15.464 --> 28:17.803
Okay, but the pole
is your friend, okay?

28:17.827 --> 28:20.105
Push your boobs up against it. Oh,
I can't. They're new.

28:20.129 --> 28:22.007
Well, do something, cecile.

28:22.031 --> 28:24.379
I'm losing my wood down here.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.712
Wow! That's a kickin' outfit.

28:26.736 --> 28:29.815
Well, thank you, sweetie.

28:29.839 --> 28:32.009
I clean up well
for a wetback, don't I?

28:35.745 --> 28:37.763
Look, I'm not
some sort of racist.

28:37.787 --> 28:40.826
I just want what's best
for my baby girl.

28:40.850 --> 28:43.228
I mean, why should I settle
for middle-class Mexicans

28:43.252 --> 28:46.436
when I know I can find
rich white folks to adopt her?

28:46.460 --> 28:48.874
Please. Do I look
middle class to you?

28:48.898 --> 28:51.807
Well, you didn't seem all that
rich in Mr. Beale's office.

28:51.831 --> 28:54.309
I mean, when I brought up
the idea of gifts

28:54.333 --> 28:56.081
to your husband,

28:56.105 --> 28:58.083
he acted like he couldn't
even afford a Harley.

28:58.107 --> 29:00.746
So is that what it's gonna take
to change your mind... a gift?

29:00.770 --> 29:02.417
Fine. What do you want?

29:02.441 --> 29:05.011
I don't know.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.856
You like jewelry?

29:10.880 --> 29:11.857
Well, here.

29:11.881 --> 29:13.728
Are these real diamonds?

29:13.752 --> 29:16.862
Honey, the one in the center
is 3 karats.

29:16.886 --> 29:19.034
I never touched
a real diamond before.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.036
Well, my husband and I
can expose you

29:21.060 --> 29:24.369
to a lot of nice new things. Well,
only if I let you have my baby.

29:24.393 --> 29:25.971
Well, like they say,

29:25.995 --> 29:29.195
there's no such thing
as a free lunch.

29:32.541 --> 29:33.849
Okay.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.520
Really?

29:35.544 --> 29:37.022
Just like that?

29:37.046 --> 29:39.184
Just like that.

29:39.208 --> 29:41.186
Of course, you probably
shouldn't tell the lawyer

29:41.210 --> 29:42.888
about our understanding,

29:42.912 --> 29:45.799
because then we'll have to deal
with percentages and all that.

29:45.823 --> 29:47.285
I always hated math.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.001
What's wrong?

29:56.025 --> 29:59.504
You never gave a crap
that we were Mexican, did you?

29:59.528 --> 30:01.776
Not really.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.809
So why put me through this?

30:03.833 --> 30:05.110
Because I thought,

30:05.134 --> 30:07.818
if it looked like
you weren't gonna get my baby

30:07.842 --> 30:10.255
that you might be
just a bit more generous.

30:10.279 --> 30:13.458
Wow. You're a lot smarter
than I thought.

30:13.482 --> 30:16.052
I'm smarter
than everybody thinks.

30:22.091 --> 30:24.900
Where's my mom? I'm thirsty.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.932
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

30:26.956 --> 30:31.076
Your mom... is in her office
on a conference call,

30:31.100 --> 30:34.379
and she's busy, so you're just
gonna have to wait, okay?

30:34.403 --> 30:35.810
What's that?

30:35.834 --> 30:38.474
That's chocolate milk.
I shouldn't be having it.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.818
Have you ever had any?

30:43.842 --> 30:45.820
Mnh-mnh.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.084
Follow me.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.897
Here. Go ahead, try it.

30:51.921 --> 30:54.599
Come on, you'll really like it.
I promise.

30:54.623 --> 30:56.101
Come on, yeah.

30:56.125 --> 30:58.603
All the grown-ups
are drinking it.

30:58.627 --> 31:00.205
Yeah, that's good.

31:00.229 --> 31:02.908
Just... chug it on down.

31:02.932 --> 31:04.039
Good.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.173
You like that?

31:08.067 --> 31:10.976
Would you like dessert
or another glass of wine?

31:11.000 --> 31:14.170
Oh, no, thank you.
I have to run. Just the check.

31:15.945 --> 31:17.923
I have a charity event
this weekend,

31:17.947 --> 31:19.925
and I have to find
a cocktail dress

31:19.949 --> 31:21.626
before the store closes.

31:21.650 --> 31:24.150
But everything was just yummy.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.933
Looks good on your ass.

31:27.957 --> 31:30.057
Thank you. Yeah.

31:36.295 --> 31:39.174
Uh, hey, Mrs. Van De Kamp.

31:39.198 --> 31:42.007
What do you think you're doing?
You're supposed to be grounded.

31:42.031 --> 31:44.249
I'm, uh, buying a belt.

31:44.273 --> 31:46.943
With what?
You don't have any money.

31:48.207 --> 31:51.386
You took that out of my
purse. Give that back.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.888
We are going home. Wait till
I tell the judge about

31:53.912 --> 31:55.890
you stealing my credit cards
and sneaking off.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.901
It's gonna do wonders for
your little emancipation case.

31:57.925 --> 32:00.365
I don't think you're gonna
let this get to the court.

32:00.389 --> 32:02.197
Oh, and why is that?

32:02.221 --> 32:05.000
Because then I'd be forced
to testify about my childhood.

32:05.024 --> 32:08.078
So? You had one of the loveliest
childhoods I've ever known.

32:08.102 --> 32:09.134
You sure about that?

32:09.158 --> 32:12.477
'Cause I'm starting
to remember some abuse.

32:12.501 --> 32:14.980
Andrew, the judge is not
seriously gonna believe

32:15.004 --> 32:17.012
that I beat you.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.484
Oh, I'm not talking
about that kind of abuse.

32:19.508 --> 32:21.686
You know, it's funny...

32:21.710 --> 32:23.688
The angrier I get,

32:23.712 --> 32:25.712
the more these repressed
memories start to come up.

32:29.018 --> 32:31.056
You can't be serious.

32:31.080 --> 32:35.250
Like, touching me in places
you shouldn't have...

32:37.526 --> 32:40.565
No one is ever gonna
believe a word of that.

32:40.589 --> 32:43.408
Yeah, well,
you know how people are.

32:43.432 --> 32:46.011
They might say
that they believe you,

32:46.035 --> 32:49.035
but... They'll always wonder.

32:50.739 --> 32:53.378
So if I were you...

32:53.402 --> 32:56.251
I'd back the hell off.

32:56.275 --> 32:57.952
Come on, Justin.

32:57.976 --> 33:01.146
I'm gonna buy you
something pretty.

33:04.353 --> 33:05.513
Justin!

33:11.120 --> 33:12.597
On second thought,

33:12.621 --> 33:15.161
I will have
another glass of wine.

33:22.431 --> 33:25.131
You can leave the bottle.

33:44.353 --> 33:46.023
Oh...

34:09.277 --> 34:10.447
Oh!

34:15.184 --> 34:16.434
Hello?

34:58.267 --> 34:59.467
Oh!

35:23.152 --> 35:24.499
Yeah?

35:24.523 --> 35:28.573
Hi, it's Bree Van De Kamp.
I didn't know who else to call,

35:28.597 --> 35:32.657
and, well, I'm in a bit
of a situation.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.114
Well...

35:40.138 --> 35:42.547
How did you get stuck like that?

35:42.571 --> 35:45.290
I would rather
not discuss it right now.

35:45.314 --> 35:48.631
Man, the other security guys
are not gonna believe this.

35:48.655 --> 35:50.124
Do you mind?

35:50.148 --> 35:52.227
I'd prefer if you...

35:52.251 --> 35:53.758
Didn't.

35:53.782 --> 35:57.532
Your son threatened you
with "repressed memories"?

35:57.556 --> 36:01.606
Oh, my god,
he isseriouslytwisted.

36:01.630 --> 36:03.468
I gotta meet this kid.

36:03.492 --> 36:05.510
You sound like you're impressed.

36:05.534 --> 36:07.212
I sorta am.

36:07.236 --> 36:10.175
Sounds like you're definitely
raising an Alpha male.

36:10.199 --> 36:13.178
I'm raising a monster,
is what I'm raising.

36:13.202 --> 36:14.819
It's no wonder I drink.

36:17.206 --> 36:19.654
I don't know why I said that.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.826
Maybe it's true.

36:21.850 --> 36:24.829
No, it makes it sound like
I think I have a problem,

36:24.853 --> 36:26.831
and I don't.

36:26.855 --> 36:30.895
Look, I don't wanna get
into a fight or anything,

36:30.919 --> 36:34.239
but you passed out
in a department store,

36:34.263 --> 36:36.741
and in my way of thinking,

36:36.765 --> 36:38.573
thatisa problem.

36:38.597 --> 36:42.327
Tonight was
a very unusual situation.

36:56.885 --> 37:00.725
I wish you could've
known me when...

37:00.749 --> 37:03.268
Rex was alive
and my kids were young,

37:03.292 --> 37:05.730
and everything was...

37:05.754 --> 37:07.764
The way it was supposed to be.

37:10.699 --> 37:15.280
I think you really
would've liked me... so much.

37:15.304 --> 37:18.783
I like you just fine.

37:18.807 --> 37:20.907
Really?

37:25.874 --> 37:28.424
Because I don't.

37:41.830 --> 37:42.990
Bye.

37:47.366 --> 37:48.366
Mom?

37:49.998 --> 37:51.368
Andrew?

38:16.965 --> 38:18.603
Caleb?

38:18.627 --> 38:20.875
Hey, Danielle.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.499
What are you doing here?

38:25.474 --> 38:27.344
Happy birthday.

38:29.378 --> 38:31.356
You really have to go home.

38:31.380 --> 38:33.758
If my mom knew you were here,
she'd freak.

38:33.782 --> 38:36.796
Don't you want to wear it? No,
I don't. Now please leave.

38:36.820 --> 38:39.715
I can help you with it. No! Didn't
you hear me, you freak?! Leave!

39:12.721 --> 39:14.699
Hey.

39:14.723 --> 39:16.861
What's wrong?

39:16.885 --> 39:20.765
You can tell everyone
in the office to relax.

39:20.789 --> 39:22.837
He won't take my milk anymore.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.869
Already?

39:24.893 --> 39:27.372
I mean, I'm sorry.

39:27.396 --> 39:28.513
Yeah, I bet.

39:28.537 --> 39:30.515
I mean, I'm not naive.

39:30.539 --> 39:33.017
I just didn't think
it would be so soon.

39:33.041 --> 39:35.780
Oh, sweetie...

39:35.804 --> 39:40.985
I know that we wanna keep them
young as long as we can,

39:41.009 --> 39:42.727
but kids grow up.

39:42.751 --> 39:44.429
They just do.

39:44.453 --> 39:46.761
I know.
If that's not bad enough,

39:46.785 --> 39:49.464
now I'm gonna get fat again.

39:49.488 --> 39:50.565
Huh?

39:50.589 --> 39:52.567
Breast-feeding
was the only thing

39:52.591 --> 39:54.569
that kept the weight off.

39:54.593 --> 39:57.980
Every mealtime was like
doing 30 minutes of cardio.

39:58.004 --> 40:00.466
Now I'm gonna have
to join a gym!

40:01.670 --> 40:04.609
Wow, that is...

40:04.633 --> 40:06.481
Really a bummer.

40:06.505 --> 40:07.682
It is.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.585
It really is.

40:31.830 --> 40:35.109
Hey, uh, Julie let me in.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.582
I can see that.

40:37.606 --> 40:40.184
So, what, did you run out
of strangers to beat up

40:40.208 --> 40:42.987
on the street, and you're going
house to house now?

40:43.011 --> 40:44.849
I feel really awful
about what happened.

40:44.873 --> 40:47.196
If you don't wanna be
my boyfriend, fine.

40:47.220 --> 40:50.194
Don't beat up the only guy who
wants to volunteer for the job.

40:50.218 --> 40:51.696
Look, I know I overreacted.

40:51.720 --> 40:54.198
But come on,
the way he was yelling at you?

40:54.222 --> 40:56.200
I deserved it, believe me.
After what I did...

40:56.224 --> 40:59.133
God, this is such a mess.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.466
He won't even
return my phone calls.

41:01.490 --> 41:04.108
What'd you do?

41:04.132 --> 41:06.949
I said something to Dr. Ron
before the operation,

41:06.973 --> 41:09.674
and it just... Devastated him.

41:09.698 --> 41:11.576
What?

41:11.600 --> 41:13.678
I can't tell you.

41:13.702 --> 41:15.680
Yeah, you can.
You can tell me anything.

41:15.704 --> 41:17.552
You know that.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.223
Mom, um, phone call.

41:19.247 --> 41:20.725
It's Dr. Ron.

41:20.749 --> 41:22.557
Oh?

41:22.581 --> 41:24.789
Um...

41:24.813 --> 41:26.631
I need to take this.

41:29.017 --> 41:32.017
You, um, you wanna
talk about this later?

41:34.763 --> 41:36.541
No.

41:36.565 --> 41:38.643
No, not really. Um...

41:38.667 --> 41:41.567
What's the point?

41:51.810 --> 41:53.140
Hi.

41:55.183 --> 41:56.721
At that precise moment,

41:56.745 --> 42:00.965
as Dr. Hanson mills was cutting
yet another umbilical cord,

42:00.989 --> 42:06.771
other ties were being severed
all over town...

42:06.795 --> 42:09.273
Like the one
between a child and the mother

42:09.297 --> 42:12.537
who didn't want him
to grow up so quickly...

42:12.561 --> 42:15.810
Or the one
between a case of fine wine

42:15.834 --> 42:18.621
and the housewife
who hadn't wanted to admit

42:18.645 --> 42:21.546
that she had a problem...

42:21.570 --> 42:24.719
Or the one between a woman
and the boyfriend

42:24.743 --> 42:27.623
who couldn't forgive
her betrayal.

42:29.547 --> 42:32.526
The choice to separate
from what we love is painful...

42:32.550 --> 42:36.530
Hey. How's my girl today?

42:36.554 --> 42:38.532
How arebothof my girls?

42:38.556 --> 42:40.534
The only thing worse...

42:40.558 --> 42:43.938
We're doing good.
We're doing real good.

42:43.962 --> 42:46.972
Is when someone we've trusted
makes the choice for us.
