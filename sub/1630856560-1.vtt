WEBVTT

00:21.083 --> 00:22.500
[woman] Look at that.

00:22.583 --> 00:24.708
I mean, really, look at that.

00:25.583 --> 00:28.500
Painted in 1914
by Hilma af Klint.

00:29.458 --> 00:32.625
She wanted to evoke
the feeling of contradiction.

00:33.041 --> 00:35.166
Some say the vertical line
breaking the canvas

00:35.250 --> 00:37.666
symbolizes where
opposite forces meet,

00:37.750 --> 00:40.375
the union necessary
for creation.

00:40.458 --> 00:42.833
The dualities
of lightness and darkness,

00:42.916 --> 00:46.041
the masculine and feminine,
life and death.

00:46.125 --> 00:48.500
And, you know,
as abstract as it may seem,

00:48.583 --> 00:51.250
this is actually a depiction
of a swan.

00:51.333 --> 00:54.708
But what do you see?
What do you feel?

00:54.791 --> 00:56.875
When my boss sees this work,
she feels envy

00:56.958 --> 00:59.333
because some lucky prick at
Sotheby's sold his collection

00:59.416 --> 01:01.250
for more money
than you could ever imagine.

01:01.333 --> 01:02.875
But, me, when I see it,

01:02.958 --> 01:05.083
I mean, the feeling
is impossible to describe.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.541
When I see it, I feel...

01:06.625 --> 01:08.416
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:09.375 --> 01:11.083
-What?
-She's talking about the print.

01:11.166 --> 01:13.416
I'm talking to both of you
about the painting.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.416
-I love it. I love the red.
-Hmm.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.750
-It's great.
-The red's nice.

01:16.833 --> 01:18.625
The red, huh?
You know what I feel when I look at it?

01:18.708 --> 01:20.833
I feel, you don't live here.

01:20.916 --> 01:22.500
So, it's a little weird

01:22.583 --> 01:24.916
that you're hanging art
on our walls.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.500
-Mm-hmm.
-You know?

01:26.583 --> 01:29.958
I hear you. It's just that, you
know, since I'm sleeping here,

01:30.041 --> 01:32.500
I thought I'd bring a little
culture into your home.

01:32.583 --> 01:35.541
-Culture? That's a circle.
-Ronnie, it's nice.

01:35.625 --> 01:37.208
It's not nice and I'm concerned

01:37.291 --> 01:39.250
that your sister's trying
to fully move in.

01:39.625 --> 01:41.291
See, this is exactly
what I'm saying.

01:41.375 --> 01:43.625
What a unique experience
you're having with the painting.

01:43.708 --> 01:46.333
-Thank you for sharing.
-Today's a big day for Ana, OK?

01:46.416 --> 01:48.000
They're doing one
of those big auctions.

01:48.083 --> 01:50.958
OK. Good luck
selling your shapes.

01:51.916 --> 01:54.625
Those shapes, Ronnie,
are worth millions of dollars.

01:54.708 --> 01:56.416
Tens of millions, in fact.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.833
And today, some of the biggest
private art collectors

01:58.916 --> 02:00.833
in all the world
are gonna be there,

02:00.916 --> 02:03.708
and I'm gonna be there with them
in the middle of it all.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.458
That is so great. Are you
gonna get a piece of the action?

02:06.541 --> 02:07.875
Because that would be wonderful.

02:07.958 --> 02:09.958
No, I'm not, because
only brokers collect commission,

02:10.041 --> 02:11.291
which is why I'm on your futon.

02:11.708 --> 02:13.875
But if I wanna work
at a top art gallery,

02:13.958 --> 02:15.416
I gotta get
a good recommendation,

02:15.500 --> 02:17.208
and there's no better
recommendation

02:17.291 --> 02:19.916
than Claire Dupont, trust me.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.166
Hmm.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.833
I don't think you guys understand
how lucky I am

02:23.916 --> 02:25.666
just to be in
Erwins's training program.

02:25.750 --> 02:27.416
I don't think you understand how lucky you
are

02:27.500 --> 02:29.625
-to be living in this house.
-[sister] Ronnie!

02:29.708 --> 02:31.333
What? She can stay here
but I can't get a dog?

02:31.750 --> 02:34.041
She's not a dog, she's
my sister. There's a difference.

02:34.125 --> 02:36.458
Yeah. You can have sex
in front of a dog.

02:36.541 --> 02:38.416
You can't have sex in front
of a dog. Shut your mouth!

02:38.875 --> 02:41.583
It's been three months.
My nutsack looks like a...

02:41.666 --> 02:43.541
[sister]
Your nutsack looks fine.

02:43.625 --> 02:46.500
Ana, listen, I hate to agree
with him at all,

02:46.583 --> 02:49.125
but he's got a little bit
of a point.

02:49.208 --> 02:51.208
We just have to come up
with a plan,

02:51.625 --> 02:53.791
because this just feels
like it's not sustainable.

02:53.875 --> 02:58.000
I hear that. It's just that,
you know, New York is expensive,

02:58.083 --> 02:59.583
and my credit is shit.

02:59.666 --> 03:01.333
-I'll be out of here soon.
-Yeah.

03:01.416 --> 03:03.791
We were talking.
It might be a good idea

03:03.875 --> 03:05.708
if you go back to Florida
and join the navy.

03:05.791 --> 03:08.500
-Ronnie, not again!
-I'm not moving back to Florida.

03:08.583 --> 03:11.458
It's great. You get to travel,
they have dental, Maverick.

03:11.541 --> 03:13.708
They'll even pay for you
to go back to school.

03:13.791 --> 03:16.166
I went to school, twice.

03:16.250 --> 03:18.583
I have a master's degree
in art history.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.333
And I have a master's
in kung fu movies,

03:20.416 --> 03:22.166
-but it doesn't pay the bills.
-What bills?

03:22.250 --> 03:23.958
Your apartment's
been rent-controlled

03:24.041 --> 03:26.458
since your grandma moved in
in, like, 1957 or some shit.

03:26.541 --> 03:29.125
My grandma died here.
My mom died here.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.875
And, by God, your sister and I
are gonna die here.

03:31.958 --> 03:33.791
You know who's not
gonna die here? You.

03:33.875 --> 03:35.250
Cause it's not your house.

03:35.750 --> 03:38.125
-It's our house.
-Oh, babe.

03:38.208 --> 03:39.833
"Oh, babe"?
Did you hear what he said?

03:39.916 --> 03:41.666
It was romantic.
He's a romantic guy.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.291
-Jesus Christ!
-[laughs]

03:43.375 --> 03:44.500
For the record,

03:45.458 --> 03:47.791
a degree in art history
is actually very useful.

03:47.875 --> 03:50.166
Useful? For what?
You're sleeping on a couch.

03:50.250 --> 03:53.125
First of all, that is not
a couch, it's a futon.

03:53.208 --> 03:55.041
This is not a house,
it's a room.

03:55.125 --> 03:58.000
And that is not a circle,
it's a swan.

03:58.083 --> 03:59.250
Jesus!

04:03.416 --> 04:06.125
[♪ "Chaise Longue" by Wet Leg]

04:06.208 --> 04:07.750
Do you see a swan?

04:07.833 --> 04:09.666
-No, I don't see a swan.

[gasps] Ana.
You look so, so good.

05:31.666 --> 05:34.457
-You look so, so good.
-I know, know, know.

05:34.541 --> 05:36.000
Today's the day, Amy.
It's auction day.

05:36.082 --> 05:37.582
It's time to get noticed.

05:37.666 --> 05:39.000
-It's time to...
-[gasps]

05:39.957 --> 05:41.500
-What?
-[gasps]

05:41.582 --> 05:43.457
-What are you looking at?
-It's not good.

05:43.541 --> 05:45.125
[Ana] What's back there? What?

05:45.207 --> 05:47.166
It's nothing, right? Right?

05:47.791 --> 05:50.500
It's not like we work for
a sociopathic perfectionist.

05:50.582 --> 05:52.125
-Oh, God.
-It's gonna be OK.

05:52.207 --> 05:53.291
It's gonna be OK.

05:53.375 --> 05:55.041
[Claire] Good morning, everyone.

05:55.125 --> 05:56.125
[gasps]

05:59.875 --> 06:01.708
Mm-hmm. Auction day.

06:02.416 --> 06:04.875
Erwins's clients are about
to walk through that door,

06:04.958 --> 06:06.875
spend millions of dollars
on a collection

06:06.958 --> 06:09.625
that I found, I curated
and I brought under this roof.

06:09.708 --> 06:10.958
When they enter,

06:11.041 --> 06:14.333
I will not allow them to see
anything less than perfection.

06:14.416 --> 06:18.082
That includes your appearances.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.332
You, you, you.

06:48.416 --> 06:51.207
Back of the house. Now go hide
before anyone sees you.

06:51.291 --> 06:53.457
For the rest of you,
in the auction room.

06:53.541 --> 06:55.541
-Let's get to work.
-Yes.

06:55.625 --> 06:56.582
Wait.

06:58.166 --> 07:00.208
You. What's your name?

07:00.625 --> 07:04.333
Me? Um, Ana. Ana Santos.

07:04.416 --> 07:07.625
What's that massive oil spill
on the back of your shirt?

07:08.583 --> 07:10.125
It's nothing.

07:10.208 --> 07:11.666
Are you implying
I'm hallucinating?

07:11.750 --> 07:12.708
No! No, sorry.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.708
Um, it must've happened
on the train.

07:15.791 --> 07:17.375
Which department are you in?

07:17.457 --> 07:20.375
Uh, I just finished up
my rotation in cataloguing,

07:20.457 --> 07:22.125
and I've been moved up
to auctions,

07:22.207 --> 07:24.541
so you're my new boss.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.250
We'll see how long that lasts.

07:27.332 --> 07:29.791
Oh, you, short, weird girl,
give her your jacket.

07:29.875 --> 07:32.250
The stain's depressing me.
Just cover it up.

07:32.332 --> 07:33.457
Course.

07:34.416 --> 07:35.625
There you go.

07:35.707 --> 07:37.832
Why would you put that
on your body permanently?

07:38.791 --> 07:41.166
-I just love art.
-Give her the jacket back.

07:41.666 --> 07:43.166
You two will be in charge
of something

07:43.250 --> 07:44.916
where you're less visible.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.041
[woman] All right, let's go.
You heard her.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.375
Today was gonna be
my first day in there.

07:49.457 --> 07:50.875
Becoming indispensable,

07:50.957 --> 07:53.166
forging a future,
making a name for myself.

07:53.250 --> 07:54.082
Shit.

07:55.207 --> 07:57.000
Sorry. Catalogue?
Have a great day.

07:57.082 --> 07:58.582
Let us know
if you need anything.

08:01.083 --> 08:04.125
This is so sad.
I mean, Claire's right.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.791
She just couldn't,
in good faith,

08:05.875 --> 08:08.833
let you in there
covered in whatever that is.

08:08.916 --> 08:10.458
Come on, Suzette. Covered?

08:10.541 --> 08:12.625
It's barely a spot.
You can't even notice it.

08:12.708 --> 08:15.500
Just keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.

08:15.583 --> 08:18.416
Although, I'm sure you're both
used to doing more the opposite.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.625
-Bye.
-Did she just...

08:21.707 --> 08:24.582
Yes. She just implied
that we suck a lot of...

08:24.666 --> 08:26.791
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.
Back at your desks.

08:26.875 --> 08:29.041
Oh. We're not staying
for the auction?

08:29.125 --> 08:30.707
Oh, yes, you are.
Just, ta-ta-ta.

08:30.791 --> 08:33.250
-[man] Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
-Back at your desks.

08:33.832 --> 08:36.250
I just don't understand
how you can become

08:36.332 --> 08:39.082
a respected artist
and still be alive, you know?

08:39.165 --> 08:41.540
[Ana] I don't understand
how I'm gonna start a gallery.

08:41.625 --> 08:44.790
Even the smallest space I looked
at is, like, ten grand a month.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.790
And you don't have diddly-squat
to your name

08:46.875 --> 08:48.458
apart from a great personality

08:48.540 --> 08:50.500
and a bucket full of dreams,
my friend.

08:50.583 --> 08:52.083
Wonder if Claire was ever broke.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.165
Don't let the fancy accent
fool you.

08:54.250 --> 08:57.208
I heard that she's from
Minnetonka, Minnesota.

08:57.290 --> 08:59.333
-What, wait?
-[Amy] I know. Crazy.

08:59.790 --> 09:00.833
Right?

09:01.583 --> 09:05.750
Anyway, if all the greatest
artists are dead and in museums,

09:05.833 --> 09:07.375
then what does that make me?

09:08.541 --> 09:10.125
-Wait, am I a ghost?
-[Ana] Amy.

09:10.208 --> 09:12.166
-[gasps]
-Look.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.541
Amarillo is acrylic.

09:14.625 --> 09:17.333
It says "oil on wood."
It should say "acrylic on wood."

09:17.750 --> 09:19.333
-You sure?
-It's a Carmen Herrera.

09:19.416 --> 09:21.208
I think I know
what I'm talking about.

09:23.333 --> 09:26.291
I think I need to go in there.
Claire should know about this.

09:26.375 --> 09:29.083
Hmm, I feel like you're trying
to get into a place

09:29.458 --> 09:31.541
that you've specifically
been told not to.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.083
I think I'm gonna do it.

09:34.165 --> 09:35.790
-I don't think you should.
-I'm gonna.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.875
-I think it's a really bad idea.
-I'm going in.

09:37.958 --> 09:39.915
-Don't leave.
-This is how I get in.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.375
When Claire kills you,
I will tell your story.

09:46.290 --> 09:52.125
And continuing on, ladies and
gentlemen, we're at $2,400,000.

09:52.208 --> 09:56.708
At 2,400,000, 2,500,000,
2,600,000 with the gentleman.

09:56.790 --> 09:59.915
2,700,000,
the lady's bid near me.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.583
-Any advance above...?
-What do you think you're doing?

10:02.666 --> 10:04.416
I need to talk to Claire.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.041
-There's been a mistake.
-Are you insane?

10:06.125 --> 10:07.791
If you don't turn around
right now,

10:07.875 --> 10:10.166
the next person
you'll be talking to is an EMT.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.416
Why is this shit-covered maniac

10:12.500 --> 10:13.625
-in Claire's auction room?
-Jesus.

10:13.708 --> 10:15.791
-Can't help you now.
-There's been a mistake.

10:15.875 --> 10:17.625
That's impossible. Which item?

10:17.708 --> 10:19.416
No time. Let me talk to Claire.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.750
[indistinct whispering]

10:22.750 --> 10:23.750
What the fuck is going on?

10:23.833 --> 10:25.708
There's been a mistake
in the catalogue.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.375
Item number 17 is mislabelled.

10:27.458 --> 10:29.541
It should say "acrylic on wood."

10:29.625 --> 10:30.791
[exhales deeply]

10:30.875 --> 10:32.540
If you're wrong,
you're finished.

10:32.625 --> 10:35.040
-I'm not.
-Leave quietly, now.

10:35.125 --> 10:36.625
-Cover that up. Go.
-OK.

10:36.708 --> 10:41.125
Amarillo "Dos",
painted in 1971, oil on wood.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.458
-Excuse me, Reggie.
Excuse me.

10:42.540 --> 10:44.750
[whispering] Acrylic on wood.

10:45.583 --> 10:49.665
Uh, small typo.
It's acrylic on wood, not oil.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.750
And, with that,
we can start the bidding...

10:59.500 --> 11:00.458
Your coffee, sir.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.000
Hmm. A little typo.

11:11.541 --> 11:12.833
A little typo?

11:15.250 --> 11:17.041
There are no little typos.

11:18.250 --> 11:21.833
There are only
huge fucking mistakes.

11:24.083 --> 11:27.208
Has everyone
recently dropped acid?

11:27.291 --> 11:30.375
How long have we had
these catalogues? Six days.

11:30.458 --> 11:34.583
Reginald, the finest auctioneer
in New York, he can't speak.

11:34.665 --> 11:36.790
He's so deeply embarrassed.

11:36.875 --> 11:38.540
This could have ruined
his reputation,

11:38.625 --> 11:41.540
Erwins's reputation
and my reputation.

11:44.165 --> 11:45.750
Who is responsible?

11:47.083 --> 11:49.458
It's inevitable. Who did it?
Come on.

11:55.290 --> 11:56.415
You.

11:58.208 --> 11:59.083
Hi.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.291
What's your name?

12:05.541 --> 12:07.583
Uh, Buh... Buh...

12:08.541 --> 12:11.291
-Uh, Buh...
-Bobby? Bronson?

12:12.500 --> 12:14.875
Blake? Blair?

12:15.833 --> 12:17.416
Basil? Benedict?

12:17.500 --> 12:19.875
Billy. Yeah. Billy.

12:19.958 --> 12:21.625
Oh, it is so perfect.

12:21.708 --> 12:24.375
Because nothing
says sophistication

12:24.458 --> 12:27.333
quite like the name Billy.

12:27.416 --> 12:31.333
So, Billy, you understand
that Carmen Herrera's "Dos"

12:31.416 --> 12:34.333
was valued at one million dollars?

12:34.415 --> 12:35.540
[Billy] Uh-huh.

12:36.540 --> 12:40.165
If you wanted to spend
a million dollars on a painting,

12:41.415 --> 12:43.875
and the person selling it to you
didn't even know

12:43.958 --> 12:47.500
what kind of paint was used,
how would you feel?

12:48.750 --> 12:50.458
You'd feel a little bit like

12:50.540 --> 12:53.250
Erwins Auction House doesn't
know what the fuck it's doing.

12:54.958 --> 12:58.208
So, Billy, today's the day
for you to lay down

12:58.290 --> 13:01.083
in the grave
that was your career,

13:01.166 --> 13:02.583
and just dissolve.

13:02.666 --> 13:06.416
There's not an auction house
on this planet

13:06.500 --> 13:07.875
that will hire you

13:07.958 --> 13:10.041
after the emails
I'm about to send out.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.375
So, it's your retirement party.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.500
OK, hooray.
Get him some champagne.

13:14.583 --> 13:15.791
Happy retirement.

13:16.583 --> 13:17.833
Drink it.

13:19.625 --> 13:22.416
-Good.
-[gulps]

13:22.500 --> 13:27.000
Done. Please, go. Go. Done. Now.

13:29.541 --> 13:30.500
Oh!

13:32.040 --> 13:33.665
Ana Santos.

13:34.625 --> 13:37.165
Ana. Thank you

13:37.250 --> 13:40.665
for doing the bare minimum
that this job requires,

13:40.750 --> 13:42.915
which is more than most today.

13:44.165 --> 13:45.540
Well done.

13:45.625 --> 13:49.208
Well done! Well done!
Well done! Well done!

13:49.290 --> 13:51.333
Here's to the bare minimum!

13:51.415 --> 13:52.375
Whoo!

13:52.790 --> 13:55.458
-Go on, Ana!
-[cheering]

14:00.666 --> 14:01.791
Ana.

14:03.541 --> 14:04.958
What's wrong?

14:05.041 --> 14:08.000
Impressing Claire earlier
was the biggest triumph.

14:08.750 --> 14:10.125
So what?

14:10.208 --> 14:13.583
Instead of pay cheques,
I got a "well done."

14:14.500 --> 14:16.083
I can't pay rent
with "well done."

14:16.166 --> 14:19.208
No, you can't.
You have to pay rent with money.

14:22.416 --> 14:27.500
Amy, if... If this program
doesn't work out,

14:27.583 --> 14:31.791
that's it. I'm gonna have
to go back to Tampa.

14:31.875 --> 14:34.625
Sell paintings
of boats to senior citizens.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.040
Hmm.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.250
Can I crash at your place later?

14:39.833 --> 14:41.540
Oh, honey, I have company later.

14:42.500 --> 14:43.665
[sighs]

14:44.625 --> 14:45.583
[keys rattle]

14:47.290 --> 14:48.665
[door squeaks]

14:52.458 --> 14:53.625
[door closes loudly]

14:53.708 --> 14:55.665
[Ronnie] Son of a bitch. Again!

14:55.750 --> 14:57.000
[sister] Shh!

14:57.083 --> 14:58.540
[Ronnie] Why are you
shushing me?

14:58.625 --> 15:00.291
[sister] Because you're being
so loud.

15:00.375 --> 15:03.208
[Ronnie mutters indistinctly]

15:04.041 --> 15:05.708
-[thud]
-[Ronnie] Are you kidding me?

15:05.791 --> 15:07.083
[sister] Shh!

15:08.500 --> 15:10.750
-[Ronnie] I can't do this.
-[sister] Shh!

15:11.458 --> 15:12.666
[thud]

15:13.416 --> 15:14.416
[sister] Now I'm up.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.250
[Ronnie] Because
she fee-fi-fo-fummed

15:16.333 --> 15:17.416
into the apartment.

15:20.333 --> 15:23.041
-[birds tweet]
-[phone rings]

15:23.125 --> 15:24.250
[Ronnie] Oh, goddamn it!

15:24.333 --> 15:25.875
Sorry!

15:25.958 --> 15:29.916
[Ronnie] What type of baboon
calls at seven in the morning?

15:30.666 --> 15:32.040
Hello, who is this?

15:32.540 --> 15:33.665
[Claire] Hello?

15:34.708 --> 15:36.708
Hello? Is the call dropped?

15:36.790 --> 15:38.750
-Are you there?
-Uh, no. Sorry about that.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.875
Um, hi. May I ask
who's speaking, please?

15:40.958 --> 15:42.250
It's Claire.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.833
-I'm sorry?
-It's your boss.

15:45.665 --> 15:47.915
-Hmm?
-Hi.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.208
Yeah, no.
Um, I know who you are.

15:50.290 --> 15:51.375
Well, I would assume.

15:51.458 --> 15:53.500
-[Ronnie mutters indistinctly]
-Shh!

15:53.583 --> 15:55.165
-Are you busy?
-Shh!

15:55.250 --> 15:58.250
No. Um, no, I'm not.
Sorry. What's up?

15:58.333 --> 15:59.625
-"What's up?"
-No, no. Sorry.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.291
I mean, uh, how can I help?

16:01.375 --> 16:03.625
Something came up last minute
at our London office.

16:03.708 --> 16:06.583
I'm going to be very busy.
I need an extra assistant.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.833
So, you need me
to come to London?

16:09.791 --> 16:11.291
Is your passport valid?

16:12.708 --> 16:16.916
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yep.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.458
Good!
So, you can come to London.

16:18.541 --> 16:20.541
Um, yeah. Yeah, sure.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.083
I mean, of course. Great.

16:22.166 --> 16:23.958
-Uh, when?
-Now.

16:25.208 --> 16:26.125
Now?

16:26.208 --> 16:28.250
You should leave
for the airport immediately.

16:28.333 --> 16:30.250
Don't be late. Suzette
is sending you the details.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.290
-Goodbye.
-Uh, bye.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.250
I just got invited to go
to London with Claire Dupont.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.458
This is what you wanted, right?

16:42.540 --> 16:44.750
-Yeah!
-Yes!

16:44.833 --> 16:46.540
[cheering and laughter]

16:46.958 --> 16:48.333
I'm going to London
with Claire Dupont!

16:48.415 --> 16:50.125
Yes, hold on.
I'll help you pack.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.790
I'm going to London
with Claire Dupont!

16:51.875 --> 16:54.583
You need to get all your things
into your bag.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.208
You don't know how long
you'll be there.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.333
I always knew
you were gonna be a big deal.

16:58.415 --> 17:00.583
That's why I let you stay here
for so long. Let me help you.

17:00.666 --> 17:03.750
Thanks, Ronnie. You know
I'm only gone for a few days?

17:03.833 --> 17:07.500
Don't jinx it. Uh, I need you
to remember something.

17:07.583 --> 17:11.000
-London ain't New York. OK?
-Right. Yeah.

17:11.083 --> 17:12.583
I don't want you
going over there

17:12.665 --> 17:14.833
getting seduced by their
big clocks and pirate accents.

17:14.915 --> 17:18.000
Listen here,
you're a New Yorker now,

17:18.083 --> 17:19.333
through and through.

17:19.415 --> 17:21.875
Even if you don't have
a place to stay.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.875
And being a New Yorker means

17:23.958 --> 17:29.041
that you fight every single day,

17:29.125 --> 17:32.041
no matter what comes at you, OK?

17:32.125 --> 17:34.375
And remember, nothing is real,

17:35.500 --> 17:37.458
if you don't believe
in who you are.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.541
That's really sweet, Ronnie.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.041
Rocky Balboa said that.

17:42.708 --> 17:43.791
Isn't he from Philly?

17:43.875 --> 17:46.125
He moved there from Brooklyn.

17:47.083 --> 17:48.333
I love you.

17:48.416 --> 17:49.791
-I love you.
-Yeah.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.000
-I love you, Viv.
-You've got this.

17:52.083 --> 17:53.375
-You got this.
-Ronnie.

17:53.458 --> 17:54.916
Hold on one second, sweetheart.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.416
-There you go. Put that on.
-Thank you.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.541
You're welcome.

17:57.625 --> 17:58.666
-Ah, OK.
-Here you go.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.166
-There you go.
-Bye, guys.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.708
Text us when
you're through security.

18:01.791 --> 18:04.458
-I will, I will, I will.
-Love you. Bye!

18:04.541 --> 18:06.000
-Get out of my house.
-Mwah.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.875
[both laugh]

18:14.666 --> 18:17.166
-Hi.
-Why don't you have a cart?

18:17.250 --> 18:19.583
Cart? A cart! Yes.

18:21.208 --> 18:22.333
So sorry.

18:31.041 --> 18:32.958
I'll meet you guys inside.

18:40.125 --> 18:41.208
OK.

18:44.708 --> 18:47.708
Hello. Give me your passport.
We're checking in.

18:48.250 --> 18:49.875
Can you hurry up?
We don't have all day.

18:52.458 --> 18:53.750
There you go.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.875
[snorts] Oh, my God,
this photo's tragic.

18:57.458 --> 18:59.208
-[laughs]
-So cute.

18:59.291 --> 19:01.666
Oh. Not really
a big traveller, hmm?

19:01.750 --> 19:04.375
I've only ever had to use it
once for study abroad.

19:04.458 --> 19:07.125
Aw. This will be so cool
for you, then.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.916
Do you wanna
place your bags up here, please?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.291
-Yep.
-Put the luggage up here.

19:12.375 --> 19:14.041
This is where
they weigh the bags

19:14.125 --> 19:15.541
to make sure
they aren't too heavy.

19:15.625 --> 19:16.750
Thank you, Renee.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.583
Oh, my God.
What is taking so long?

19:20.666 --> 19:24.458
The whole point of gold status
is efficiency. Hmm!

19:26.583 --> 19:29.291
Oh, no, no, no.
You're not on this flight.

19:30.250 --> 19:31.625
I'm not travelling
with you guys?

19:31.708 --> 19:32.958
Our flight was full,

19:33.041 --> 19:36.416
so I put you on one that leaves
in four hours, in economy.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.375
Get some sleep. We're gonna need
you to hit the ground running.

19:39.458 --> 19:41.708
Yeah. Claire doesn't believe
in jet lag.

19:42.541 --> 19:45.208
Um, why did you guys have me
get here so early?

19:45.291 --> 19:46.791
To help with the bags, silly.

19:47.750 --> 19:49.166
Enjoy your flight.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.041
Hmm, thanks.

19:51.125 --> 19:53.250
You're between me
and my first martini.

19:53.333 --> 19:54.791
[laughs] Unwise.

19:56.416 --> 19:58.750
Uh, is there an on switch
for you?

19:58.833 --> 20:01.541
Oh, um, my flight doesn't leave
for another few hours, so...

20:01.625 --> 20:02.791
-Fully booked out.
-Yeah.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.666
Oh, really?
Why are you here so early?

20:06.875 --> 20:10.500
In case you needed help
with bags or holding things.

20:10.583 --> 20:14.500
Oh, OK. Strong choice.
Way to kiss ass. La forza!

20:14.583 --> 20:17.041
Still, I expect you in action
first thing in the morning.

20:17.125 --> 20:18.416
None of this jet-lag bullshit.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.041
I'll create an email account and
call-forwarding to her phone.

20:21.125 --> 20:24.416
Renee, spare me the details.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.541
Let's move.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.250
Welcome to being attached
to your phone 24/7.

20:28.333 --> 20:31.291
London, so exciting.
See you there.

20:34.625 --> 20:36.833
I don't know how you put up
with those three.

20:37.791 --> 20:40.250
I'm going to England
for the first time in my life.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.708
If I have to wait,
that's what I'll do.

20:42.791 --> 20:44.833
-Can I see your passport?
-Yeah.

20:47.166 --> 20:50.041
Least amount of legroom
and next to the toilet?

20:50.125 --> 20:53.708
Oh, someone knows
how to ruin a transatlantic.

20:53.791 --> 20:55.333
You're gonna need your rest.

20:55.416 --> 20:57.791
The best place to wait
is in the first-class lounge.

20:57.875 --> 21:00.250
[laughs] Well, unless
that computer can pay off

21:00.333 --> 21:02.250
years of student loan debt...

21:02.333 --> 21:03.666
You just been upgraded.

21:03.750 --> 21:04.708
Upgraded?

21:06.041 --> 21:07.041
What? Why?

21:07.125 --> 21:09.541
I only deal with assholes
a couple of times a day.

21:09.625 --> 21:12.250
Seems like you need to
all the time.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.666
First class?
I've never been in first class.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.416
This is incredible.
Thank you so much.

21:16.500 --> 21:20.583
I don't even know what to say.
Just got upgraded. [laughs]

21:20.666 --> 21:22.791
Told you it wasn't a myth.

21:25.708 --> 21:29.083
-Hi, welcome to the lounge.
-Hi. Thank you.

21:29.166 --> 21:32.916
We're gonna put you in the spa,
get you a nice long massage.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.333
And then afterwards,
maybe some fun treatments.

21:35.416 --> 21:39.416
And then, we will gladly
send you off with a Bloody Mary.

21:40.250 --> 21:43.083
Ooh, yes, please,
to all of that.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.208
-Hey.
-How are you?

21:52.291 --> 21:55.041
The spa's lovely.
Yeah, you should try it.

21:56.333 --> 22:01.583
[phone rings]

22:02.166 --> 22:03.625
Hello?

22:03.708 --> 22:05.750
[woman] I'm trying to reach
Claire Dupont. Is this Suzette?

22:05.833 --> 22:08.333
No. Uh, sorry,
this is Ana, her third.

22:08.416 --> 22:12.208
Claire's on a flight right now,
um, but how can I help?

22:12.291 --> 22:14.541
I need a London address
for the delivery.

22:14.625 --> 22:17.833
Address? Uh, sorry, one
second. Let me just check...

22:17.916 --> 22:19.208
-Oh!
-Oh.

22:19.291 --> 22:20.583
-[Ana gasps]
-[sighs]

22:21.416 --> 22:22.250
Oh, my God.

22:23.708 --> 22:27.833
-Oh, my God!
-[English accent] Yeah. Uh...

22:27.916 --> 22:29.166
-And they're suede.
-Yeah.

22:29.250 --> 22:30.250
They're suede.

22:30.333 --> 22:32.625
-It's fine. Don't worry.
-Why don't you come with me?

22:32.708 --> 22:34.458
-Can I pay for your dry-cleaning?
-No, it's fine.

22:34.541 --> 22:35.708
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

22:36.666 --> 22:37.708
Sorry.

22:39.166 --> 22:42.416
[woman] Hello?
Are you still there? Hello?

22:42.500 --> 22:44.708
Miss Santos,
lovely to have you on board.

22:44.791 --> 22:46.583
Care for a champagne to start?

22:46.666 --> 22:48.916
I would, thank you.

22:50.166 --> 22:51.208
Right.

22:57.416 --> 22:58.375
[camera clicks]

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
-[man] Hello.
-Hi.

23:01.083 --> 23:05.625
...robes and God knows
how many different facial creams

23:05.708 --> 23:07.375
she had on. One second, sorry.

23:08.875 --> 23:12.666
[gasps] Shit.

23:12.750 --> 23:15.041
Bruv, she was stomping
around the lounge,

23:15.125 --> 23:16.625
not looking where she's going.

23:16.708 --> 23:19.458
She throws her drink all over
me, face is glued to her phone.

23:19.541 --> 23:22.166
Not a care in the world. Yeah,
she's probably an alcoholic.

23:24.458 --> 23:27.208
Hmm. That's a good idea.

23:27.291 --> 23:28.750
[chuckles]

23:29.708 --> 23:31.291
OK, bye. Sorry.

23:31.375 --> 23:34.166
Can I offer sir anything?
Wine, beer, Bloody Mary?

23:34.750 --> 23:36.375
If you want a Bloody Mary,

23:36.458 --> 23:37.916
you can wring out my jacket.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.875
You'd probably get
a few glasses out of it.

23:40.333 --> 23:43.750
Um, but, no.
Two glasses of champagne.

23:43.833 --> 23:46.208
[attendant]
Two champagnes? Of course, sir.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.583
Thank you. You didn't want
anything else, did you?

23:48.666 --> 23:50.000
No, I'm good, thank you.

23:50.083 --> 23:51.125
-[man] You sure?
-Mm-hmm.

23:51.208 --> 23:54.291
-Bloody Mary maybe?
-No, never really liked them.

23:54.375 --> 23:56.541
Oh, right.
Well, I apologize then,

23:56.625 --> 23:58.958
because I smell like
I'm wearing a cologne by V8.

23:59.041 --> 24:00.541
I thought that was on purpose.

24:00.625 --> 24:01.583
[laughs]

24:03.708 --> 24:04.875
I'm William, by the way.

24:04.958 --> 24:06.208
Ana.

24:06.291 --> 24:08.250
Ana. It's a pleasure
to meet you, Ana.

24:08.333 --> 24:09.791
What brings you to London?

24:09.875 --> 24:12.541
Uh, work.
Are you headed back home?

24:12.625 --> 24:15.416
What gave it away?
Sophisticated English charm?

24:15.500 --> 24:17.833
[laughs] Yeah, that must be it.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.291
But, no, I'm actually, uh...

24:20.375 --> 24:22.750
I was at a job interview
in New York.

24:22.833 --> 24:24.875
Now I'm on my way back
to see my mum for her birthday.

24:25.833 --> 24:28.250
OK. You get points back
for that.

24:28.333 --> 24:30.083
Points? I didn't realise
we were playing a game.

24:30.583 --> 24:32.875
-What do I get if I win?
-A Bloody Mary.

24:32.958 --> 24:35.458
Right. Well, in that case,
I'll stop trying to score.

24:47.083 --> 24:50.083
What... What kind of work
brings you over to England then?

24:51.041 --> 24:53.416
I work for an auction house
here in the city,

24:54.375 --> 24:56.250
and our London branch
has called in

24:56.333 --> 24:59.791
the director of the New York
office to save the day.

24:59.875 --> 25:02.000
-The director?
-Mm-hmm.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.875
Wow, that's...
That's impressive.

25:03.958 --> 25:06.625
-Yeah, I guess.
-Forgive me for this.

25:06.708 --> 25:08.791
You seem a bit young
to be the director.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.958
[laughs]

25:11.041 --> 25:12.875
[William]
What? Do you get that a lot?

25:15.083 --> 25:17.833
Yeah. Yeah, actually, I do.

25:18.666 --> 25:22.083
Well, it's probably
cause I'm, like,

25:22.166 --> 25:24.916
the youngest director
in company history.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.250
-Wow.
-Yeah.

25:27.333 --> 25:28.500
Jesus, wow.

25:29.916 --> 25:31.583
Lucky you. Good person to know.

25:31.666 --> 25:34.041
I worked very hard for it, Will.

25:34.625 --> 25:35.958
Can I call you Will?

25:36.916 --> 25:39.333
-[William laughs]
-[Ana] Am I wrong though?

25:39.416 --> 25:42.083
-I can't believe you said that.
-You're evil.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.875
Seems like you two
are enjoying yourselves.

25:43.958 --> 25:45.250
Well, that's what you think.

25:45.333 --> 25:46.875
She's been attacking
my livelihood

25:46.958 --> 25:48.500
-for the last half an hour.
-[laughs]

25:48.583 --> 25:51.333
-Shall I get you another round?
-Yeah, go on then.

25:51.416 --> 25:53.166
-Please. Thank you.
-Course, sir.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.083
These are so cute.

25:59.375 --> 26:00.666
Right, no. Look.

26:00.750 --> 26:02.958
The point that
I'm trying to make is,

26:03.041 --> 26:06.333
to do what I do, you have
to interact with art every day.

26:06.416 --> 26:08.708
I'm sorry. How does someone
who works in advertising

26:08.791 --> 26:11.416
-interact with art every day?
-Oh. Don't do this.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.916
Just because you're a swanky
art director from New York,

26:14.000 --> 26:16.208
it doesn't mean you get
to decide what is and isn't art.

26:16.291 --> 26:18.125
Actually, that's exactly
what it means.

26:18.208 --> 26:20.666
Name one meaningful thing
that came from an ad.

26:20.750 --> 26:23.875
-I wouldn't exist without an ad.
-Oh, come on.

26:23.958 --> 26:26.541
OK, well,
I'll just prove it to you.

26:26.625 --> 26:31.000
Um, my mum did a yogurt ad
back in the '90s,

26:31.083 --> 26:32.375
and my dad saw it

26:32.458 --> 26:35.708
and basically chased her down
until she agreed to marry him

26:35.791 --> 26:37.166
and have a kid.

26:39.125 --> 26:40.750
-That's your mom?
-Mm-hmm.

26:41.708 --> 26:43.500
-She's beautiful.
-That's a much nicer description

26:44.000 --> 26:45.875
than what the boys at school
used to say.

26:46.375 --> 26:48.750
So, this is what your
entire existence boils down to?

26:48.833 --> 26:51.250
Your dad getting horny
for raw, Greek yogurt?

26:51.333 --> 26:54.166
If you want to give me an
existential crisis, then, yes,

26:54.250 --> 26:56.083
that's what it comes down to.

26:58.291 --> 26:59.875
-It just goes to show...
-Mm-hmm.

26:59.958 --> 27:02.416
...that chance moments can
change the course of your life.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.833
[laughs softly]

27:42.833 --> 27:44.333
[attendant]
Ladies and gentlemen,

27:44.416 --> 27:47.000
we are beginning our descent
into London. The pilot...

27:47.083 --> 27:49.791
Hello. Please put your seat up
for landing.

27:50.625 --> 27:51.958
Yeah. Yeah.

27:53.375 --> 27:54.875
And also, I'm going to need

27:54.958 --> 27:56.583
the salt and pepper shakers
back.

27:57.541 --> 27:58.500
[Ana] What?

27:58.583 --> 28:01.291
[attendant]
The salt and pepper shakers.

28:05.458 --> 28:07.291
Mm-hmm.

28:11.416 --> 28:14.083
-Sorry about that.
-Thank you.

28:21.416 --> 28:22.291
Unbelievable.

28:23.541 --> 28:26.458
I'm gonna have to have a word
with Immigration when we land.

28:41.375 --> 28:42.333
Shit.

28:42.416 --> 28:44.166
Do you know where you're going?

28:44.250 --> 28:47.000
Uh, yeah, the Carlson?

28:47.083 --> 28:48.541
-Very swanky.
-Only the best.

28:48.958 --> 28:50.708
-Well, look, if you'd like...
-[woman] Will!

28:52.541 --> 28:55.750
-Will! Will!
-One moment.

28:55.833 --> 28:58.708
Hey! Oh, hello, my darling.

28:58.791 --> 29:01.500
-Hi, Mum.
-Hmm, why are you so smelly?

29:01.583 --> 29:03.500
My goodness.
Look at you. What have you done?

29:03.583 --> 29:05.583
-Yes, can...?
-Why do you look so tired?

29:05.666 --> 29:07.458
-How was the flight?
-Yeah, well, the...

29:07.541 --> 29:09.041
Did you bring
a beautiful woman home

29:09.125 --> 29:10.666
to meet
your rapidly aging mother?

29:10.750 --> 29:12.375
There's hope
for grandchildren yet.

29:12.458 --> 29:13.458
Mum, this is Ana.

29:13.541 --> 29:15.791
She's an American.
It's her first time in London.

29:15.875 --> 29:17.625
She's the one
that spilt Bloody Mary

29:17.708 --> 29:19.416
all over my shoes,
trousers and jacket.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.333
-[Mum] Willy, don't be rude.
-[laughs]

29:21.750 --> 29:24.041
Ana, I would like to introduce
you to my mum, Catherine.

29:24.125 --> 29:26.250
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

29:26.333 --> 29:27.458
You are gorgeous.

29:27.541 --> 29:30.333
You look like you stepped out
of a Jean Béraud painting.

29:30.416 --> 29:33.416
Oh, what a charming thing
to say.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.791
Jean Béraud is actually
one of my favourites.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.291
-Mine too.
-Tell me, where are you going?

29:37.375 --> 29:40.666
-Are you waiting for someone?
-Um, no. I'm on my own,

29:40.750 --> 29:42.375
but I'm going to the Carlson.

29:42.458 --> 29:44.791
No, no, no, no, not the Carlson.

29:44.875 --> 29:46.416
That's four streets
from my house.

29:46.500 --> 29:47.791
Do you want a lift?

29:47.875 --> 29:49.958
Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't.
I'll just...

29:50.041 --> 29:52.083
Come with us, please.

29:52.166 --> 29:53.583
That'd be incredibly helpful.

29:53.666 --> 29:56.416
-Grab her bags.
-I... I was going to.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.541
-Hello, sir.
-Hi, Joe, how are you?

29:58.625 --> 29:59.958
I'm all right. Nice to see you.

30:00.041 --> 30:02.041
-This is our new friend Ana.
-Miss Ana.

30:02.125 --> 30:03.833
-Hi.
-Let me get these for you.

30:03.916 --> 30:05.666
Let me just...
I'll take this with me.

30:05.750 --> 30:07.083
Yeah, no worries.

30:07.166 --> 30:10.458
[Catherine] We'll do a stopover
at the Carlson to drop off Ana.

30:10.541 --> 30:12.791
Very nice. You must be doing
very well for yourself.

30:12.875 --> 30:15.791
Actually, what is it
that you do, darling?

30:15.875 --> 30:17.416
God, don't get her started.

30:18.375 --> 30:20.500
I work in the art business.

30:20.583 --> 30:22.291
[Catherine gasps]
That's wonderful.

30:22.375 --> 30:24.208
-[laughs]
-I knew I liked you.

30:25.541 --> 30:27.625
Art business. What a paradox.

30:27.708 --> 30:30.125
Like saying you work
in chocolates or drugs

30:30.208 --> 30:34.416
or phenomenal sex.
Slices of heaven.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.250
But, what specifically?

30:37.208 --> 30:38.583
-Specifically?
-[Catherine] Yes.

30:38.666 --> 30:40.791
Like, like, what I do
specifically?

30:40.875 --> 30:42.625
-Yes.
-[Ana] God, it's so boring.

30:42.708 --> 30:47.416
Um, I basically source and sell
elite collections

30:47.500 --> 30:51.125
of some of the most exquisite
art from around the world,

30:51.208 --> 30:52.583
to all sorts of...

30:52.666 --> 30:55.333
Oligarchs, warlords,
billionaires.

30:55.416 --> 30:57.291
...clients who think
they understand art

30:57.375 --> 30:58.583
better than I do,

30:58.666 --> 31:00.791
like your charming ad exec
of a son over here.

31:01.375 --> 31:03.291
-What do you do, Catherine?
-You'll never guess.

31:03.750 --> 31:06.666
[chuckles] Well, actually,
I'm a bit of an artist myself.

31:06.750 --> 31:09.333
-An eccentric like you.
-Oh.

31:09.416 --> 31:12.291
Though, in the end, the muses
chose to make me a star

31:12.375 --> 31:14.458
of both stage and screen.

31:14.541 --> 31:15.500
And yogurt ads.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.291
God! Did those
make it stateside?

31:18.375 --> 31:20.833
-I used to love them ads.
-I showed her, Mum.

31:20.916 --> 31:22.291
Oh, you're such a braggart.

31:22.375 --> 31:25.375
So, does that mean
you're famous?

31:25.458 --> 31:27.833
From Dover to the Hebrides,

31:27.916 --> 31:30.833
but my work never translated
to the States, I'm afraid.

31:30.916 --> 31:33.208
I'm too complicated
for their taste.

31:33.291 --> 31:34.625
She's UK famous.

31:35.583 --> 31:37.708
For the best, really.
I wouldn't be comfortable

31:37.791 --> 31:40.416
sharing the same continent
as Florida.

31:41.708 --> 31:43.500
I'm actually from there.

31:45.416 --> 31:50.291
-[laughs]
-Darling, you seem so sane.

32:01.083 --> 32:02.000
Whoa.

32:22.458 --> 32:23.291
Thank you.

32:25.333 --> 32:27.166
OK, so listen, look.
If you're not too busy

32:27.250 --> 32:29.583
being a swanky art director
from New York,

32:29.666 --> 32:32.583
or whatever it is you do,
I would love to take you out.

32:32.666 --> 32:34.083
Show you round the town,
you know?

32:34.166 --> 32:37.291
Only thing is, I might be
really busy with work.

32:37.375 --> 32:38.375
Right, OK.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.208
But we can probably
exchange numbers.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.041
-[Catherine] Ana.
-Oh, for...

32:42.125 --> 32:43.708
You must give me
your phone number.

32:43.791 --> 32:45.833
Sure. Course.

32:47.083 --> 32:49.041
-I want to see her again.
-Nice and subtle.

32:49.125 --> 32:51.125
-Thank you, Mum.
-[chuckles]

32:51.208 --> 32:52.625
There you go.

32:52.708 --> 32:55.333
Now I'll shut up
and let you two sort it.

32:55.416 --> 32:57.750
-Bye, darling.
-Thank you so much for the ride.

32:57.833 --> 32:59.000
[Catherine] Oh, please, darling.

32:59.083 --> 33:01.666
Uh, so I guess I'll just...

33:01.750 --> 33:03.833
You'll get my number
from your mom.

33:03.916 --> 33:05.375
-Yeah, exactly.
-[laughs]

33:05.458 --> 33:07.875
Uh, right, well, I better
get home and get changed.

33:07.958 --> 33:10.541
-I'm so sorry again about the...
-It's all good. I'm joking.

33:10.875 --> 33:12.208
-[laughs]
-All right.

33:12.291 --> 33:15.500
-All right. Bye.
-Bye.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.333
[Claire] OK, let me make myself
very clear.

33:25.291 --> 33:27.750
Has the Brovil collection
been moved and inspected?

33:27.833 --> 33:31.416
I want progress reports.
Ah, finally you're here.

33:31.500 --> 33:34.541
You realise that waiting
makes you all totally worthless.

33:34.625 --> 33:38.375
If I'm going to rearrange
my life to fix your mistake,

33:38.458 --> 33:39.958
then the least you can do

33:40.041 --> 33:43.750
is keep that overly gelled
amphibian away from my office.

33:45.208 --> 33:46.208
Si, ciao.

33:52.875 --> 33:54.416
Don't fall for it.

33:55.375 --> 33:57.750
It's not usually this nice.

33:58.625 --> 34:00.458
Since it's your first time
in London,

34:00.541 --> 34:02.541
please, let me give you
some advice.

34:03.416 --> 34:05.916
Always prepare for rain. Hmm.

34:06.875 --> 34:11.041
Remember that you are here
for work, huh? And not for play.

34:12.458 --> 34:17.333
And, whatever you do, don't try
to outdrink those locals.

34:17.416 --> 34:19.666
Don't sleep with anyone
that looks like Jude Law.

34:22.375 --> 34:23.458
What are you looking at?

34:23.541 --> 34:25.708
-[Ana] Um...
-He comes with the suite.

34:26.666 --> 34:29.166
-Is he, like, a butler?
-He's Percy.

34:29.250 --> 34:30.416
[Percy] Yes, madam?

34:30.500 --> 34:32.375
-No, nothing, Percy.
-Thank you, madam.

34:33.416 --> 34:35.333
Are you moving rooms
or something?

34:35.416 --> 34:38.125
No, going to Rome.

34:38.208 --> 34:41.666
[groans] The Rome office
is just a shitshow.

34:41.750 --> 34:45.541
-Wait, we're going to Rome?
-No, I'm going to Rome.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.750
You and Suzette and Renee,
you will stay here.

34:47.833 --> 34:49.791
You will look after the auction.
I'll be back tomorrow.

34:50.208 --> 34:52.458
-Take notes.
-Yeah, I'll just grab my laptop.

34:54.958 --> 34:58.583
[Claire] At 1pm, there will be
a staff meeting, at Erwins.

34:58.666 --> 34:59.875
Shit.

34:59.958 --> 35:02.750
[Claire] You will go directly
into the office.

35:02.833 --> 35:04.250
Don't speak to anyone
except Suzette.

35:04.750 --> 35:06.625
She will take you to your desk.

35:06.708 --> 35:11.916
Look. This folder,
it has every piece of art

35:12.000 --> 35:15.291
that I have curated and sold
at Erwins.

35:15.375 --> 35:17.416
-That's a really big folder.
-Is that a problem?

35:18.333 --> 35:20.125
No, no, no, it's incredible.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.333
I want you
to go through every piece

35:26.416 --> 35:28.666
and tell me the current value.

35:29.750 --> 35:32.541
I want hard numbers as leverage.

35:32.625 --> 35:34.166
[Ana] Leverage for what?

35:34.250 --> 35:36.458
Oh, between us,
none of your business.

35:37.416 --> 35:38.500
Right. Totally.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.416
[Claire] OK, go on.
I'm done, I'm done.

35:41.500 --> 35:44.791
Oh, um, should I check in
to the hotel before...?

35:44.875 --> 35:46.250
You're not staying here.

35:46.333 --> 35:48.333
Suzette will have booked you
something more economical.

35:48.416 --> 35:50.208
Also, remind her
about the tickets.

35:50.291 --> 35:53.041
-Tickets. Tickets for what?
-She will know.

35:53.125 --> 35:55.000
Unless you want to be
incredibly late,

35:55.083 --> 35:57.000
I would have left
15 minutes ago.

35:57.083 --> 35:58.041
Yep, leaving.

35:58.125 --> 35:59.958
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

36:01.708 --> 36:02.875
OK.

36:10.708 --> 36:12.833
Shit. Excuse me.

36:12.916 --> 36:15.625
Would you happen to have
my laptop bag by any chance?

36:16.583 --> 36:19.083
Let me ask, but I'm quite sure
that's all we had.

36:20.041 --> 36:21.833
Shit. I must've left it
in the car.

36:22.375 --> 36:23.916
-I'm so sorry.
-No, it's OK. Thank you.

36:34.291 --> 36:35.291
Shit.

36:41.125 --> 36:42.583
-[woman] Thanks.
-Thank you.

37:07.875 --> 37:09.375
-Claire Dupont?
-Upstairs.

37:12.125 --> 37:13.000
Shit.

37:25.208 --> 37:26.333
I'm here.

37:27.291 --> 37:28.416
I made it.

37:28.500 --> 37:31.333
Wow. Did you navigate
by compass?

37:31.416 --> 37:33.416
I'm not late
for the staff meeting, am I?

37:35.333 --> 37:38.375
OK, this is not something Claire
should ever be associated with.

37:39.333 --> 37:40.583
What?

37:40.666 --> 37:43.125
Clean your shit up. Hide
your suitcase under my desk.

37:44.583 --> 37:47.083
-OK.
-[phone pings]

37:48.041 --> 37:49.041
Let's go.

37:51.833 --> 37:55.500
Remember, no one in there
is your friend other than us.

37:55.583 --> 37:56.958
And we're not even your friends.

37:58.458 --> 38:00.333
Cool. Can't wait.

38:00.666 --> 38:03.291
You all must be wondering
why I've brought you out here

38:03.375 --> 38:05.125
on such short notice.

38:05.208 --> 38:07.625
We have access to a collection
that no one else has,

38:08.625 --> 38:12.125
that only a few people
even had a chance to see.

38:12.208 --> 38:14.750
For God's sakes, Arnold!
Please, what is it?

38:15.708 --> 38:17.875
It's the Brovil collection.

38:17.958 --> 38:19.166
Wow.

38:19.583 --> 38:23.375
But the Brovil collection has
been locked away for decades.

38:24.333 --> 38:26.666
-What's a Brovil?
-[Arnold] Yes, and now it's not.

38:26.750 --> 38:28.916
Ooh, you must have
talked him round, boss.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.333
No, he's dead.

38:30.416 --> 38:34.291
But his wife has been
spending his fortune

38:34.375 --> 38:37.583
at a rate that frankly
blows my mind.

38:37.666 --> 38:40.291
She needs money
and she needs it now.

38:41.250 --> 38:43.708
This collection will bring the
biggest clients under one roof.

38:43.791 --> 38:46.708
Spread the word discreetly.
I only want whales.

38:46.791 --> 38:48.583
-Should I be taking notes?
-Shh.

38:48.666 --> 38:49.625
Who is the owner?

38:49.958 --> 38:52.208
That will remain on
a need-to-know basis.

38:53.166 --> 38:57.375
To ensure our success,
I've brought in our top brokers.

38:57.458 --> 39:00.666
Gerard, director
of the Paris office,

39:00.750 --> 39:02.208
and Claire Dupont from New York.

39:03.166 --> 39:06.666
Claire is currently on her way
to Rome with another crisis.

39:06.750 --> 39:09.208
But hopefully,
she will be back in time

39:09.291 --> 39:11.916
to celebrate our success,
my friends.

39:12.458 --> 39:15.333
[Arnold] I expect you
to work together as a team.

39:15.416 --> 39:18.041
I expect us to shine.

39:18.125 --> 39:19.791
Now, go for the kill.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.458
Hello. You must be Ana.

39:23.291 --> 39:25.791
Hi. Yeah.
How do you know my name?

39:25.875 --> 39:28.708
Oh, it's a part of my job
to know our up-and-comers.

39:28.791 --> 39:31.708
And I'm told you were
quite a star in New York.

39:31.791 --> 39:34.750
Oh, no. I'm just an assistant.

39:34.833 --> 39:36.333
We all have to start somewhere.

39:36.416 --> 39:40.041
-And I'm sure that you do great.
-Thank you.

39:40.458 --> 39:44.750
But, please, let me know if
you are confused about anything

39:44.833 --> 39:49.125
or if you need a friendly ear,
OK? I know how Claire can be.

39:49.208 --> 39:50.666
-She is a...
-[Suzette] Gerard, hi.

39:51.166 --> 39:52.500
So nice to see you.

39:52.583 --> 39:55.416
Ana, come with us.
We'll show you to your desk.

39:56.041 --> 39:58.125
-[Renee] He's the enemy.
-He's worse than the enemy.

39:58.583 --> 40:00.958
Claire always says, "We compete
with Sotheby's and Christie's,

40:01.041 --> 40:03.250
but we're at war
with Gerard and Paris."

40:03.333 --> 40:05.250
-What did he do?
-What hasn't he done?

40:05.333 --> 40:08.041
He's the guy who sold Van Gogh
to that NFT asshole.

40:08.125 --> 40:09.291
That was him?

40:09.375 --> 40:12.375
He claims he sold art to an
artist who enhanced the piece.

40:12.458 --> 40:14.125
He spray-painted
a smiley face on it.

40:14.208 --> 40:17.125
Exactly. If Gerard ever
steps foot on American soil,

40:17.208 --> 40:19.208
I told my dad
to have him black-bagged

40:19.291 --> 40:20.666
-and sent to Guantanamo.
-What?

40:20.750 --> 40:23.375
[Suzette] So, what's your deal?

40:23.458 --> 40:26.250
Are you hoping to impress Claire
so that she replaces one of us.

40:26.333 --> 40:28.541
If you think that, you've got
another thing coming.

40:28.625 --> 40:29.916
I don't have a deal.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.250
I just wanna graduate
from the training program

40:32.333 --> 40:34.208
-and open a gallery someday.
-A gallery?

40:34.291 --> 40:36.291
All I'm saying is,
I don't wanna steal your jobs.

40:36.708 --> 40:39.791
OK, whatever. When Claire
gets promoted to Arnold's job,

40:39.875 --> 40:42.416
the two of us are going
with her, not you.

40:42.500 --> 40:43.458
Where's Arnold going?

40:43.541 --> 40:46.583
He wants to retire any day now,
and when he does...

40:46.666 --> 40:48.875
Claire will become the first
female chairman of Erwins

40:48.958 --> 40:50.666
and we'll be
right alongside her.

40:54.083 --> 40:57.000
[whirring]

40:57.958 --> 40:59.375
What is this place?

40:59.458 --> 41:01.666
Claire doesn't usually travel
with her third assistant,

41:01.750 --> 41:04.041
so there's not really any space
for you upstairs.

41:04.125 --> 41:05.125
What's that smell?

41:05.208 --> 41:07.500
-Formaldehyde.
-Rotting wood.

41:07.583 --> 41:09.875
England. No offence.

41:09.958 --> 41:12.625
Oh, um, Claire wanted me
to remind you about the tickets.

41:12.708 --> 41:15.416
Oh, God, the Midsummer tickets.
They're sold out for weeks.

41:15.500 --> 41:16.541
It's not gonna happen.

41:16.625 --> 41:17.583
Voilà.

41:19.583 --> 41:22.041
Oh. Lovely.

41:22.125 --> 41:22.958
[Suzette] Mm-hmm.

41:23.791 --> 41:27.500
-So, this is my office?
-Yeah.

41:28.458 --> 41:30.500
-Let me guess. My hotel...
-It's a shithole.

41:30.583 --> 41:33.041
-It's a shithole.
-Enjoy the asbestos.

41:33.125 --> 41:34.666
-[Suzette] Bye.
-Bye.

41:38.416 --> 41:39.750
[sighs]

41:45.458 --> 41:46.666
[phone pings]

41:52.291 --> 41:53.958
[Catherine]
Will? Is it recording?

41:54.041 --> 41:55.833
[Will] Yes, Mum,
it's recording.

41:55.916 --> 41:58.208
[Catherine]
Sweetie, it's Catherine.

41:58.291 --> 42:00.333
I have your laptop.

42:00.416 --> 42:02.458
Listen, sweetheart.
You must come over.

42:02.541 --> 42:04.916
It's quite an impromptu thing,
a few friends.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.416
I'm texting you the address
right now.

42:07.500 --> 42:09.291
See you soon, darling. Kisses.

42:09.375 --> 42:11.875
No. No, no, no, no, no.

42:13.458 --> 42:16.375
[thunder]

42:16.458 --> 42:19.458
[raucous chatter]

42:22.333 --> 42:25.125
[cheering and laughter]

42:39.333 --> 42:40.958
[sighs]

42:47.333 --> 42:49.166
[phone rings]

42:53.500 --> 42:55.458
[Amy] How's it going?
Tell me everything.

42:55.541 --> 42:58.958
OK, so here's my plan.
Go to the party, grab my laptop,

42:59.041 --> 43:00.916
try not to talk to anybody
while I'm there,

43:01.000 --> 43:03.375
grab a cab and come back home
to this shithole.

43:03.458 --> 43:06.625
Or... you drink as many
free drinks as you can.

43:06.708 --> 43:09.708
You hang out with some
fancy British celebrities.

43:09.791 --> 43:12.541
Then you get dicked down by your
own personal Prince William.

43:12.625 --> 43:14.708
Forgetting this laptop
could be the best thing

43:14.791 --> 43:17.125
-that's ever happened to you.
-No, Amy, I lied to him

43:17.625 --> 43:19.833
and his mom
about so many things.

43:19.916 --> 43:22.208
Ah, you lied on an aeroplane.

43:22.291 --> 43:25.291
Besides, do you really think
that she would've given you

43:25.375 --> 43:28.083
her number if she'd known
you were a homeless intern?

43:28.166 --> 43:29.083
No offence.

43:29.166 --> 43:31.708
Personally, I'm jealous of your
Hannah Montana lifestyle.

43:31.791 --> 43:32.750
[laughs]

43:32.833 --> 43:35.041
And plane guy sounds
really, really hot.

43:35.125 --> 43:36.333
What do you think?

43:38.125 --> 43:40.208
You should never be afraid
to put yourself out there.

43:40.291 --> 43:41.666
Bob agrees.

43:41.750 --> 43:43.791
Well, if Bob agrees...

43:47.125 --> 43:48.875
[music playing in distance]

43:52.708 --> 43:55.166
[woman laughs]

43:56.500 --> 43:59.166
No, you're... You're horrible.
You're just horrible.

43:59.250 --> 44:00.916
No, I'm not lying.
Honestly, ask him.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.208
I'll send him home right away.
I love you, Joe.

44:03.291 --> 44:05.250
[gasps] Ana!

44:05.333 --> 44:07.416
-Catherine.
-Ooh.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.583
-[laughs]
-Oh, my God, you look amazing.

44:09.666 --> 44:11.041
-Yes!
-Hi.

44:11.125 --> 44:13.541
-Oh. Come in, come in, come in.
-No, it's fine.

44:13.625 --> 44:15.541
I'll just grab my laptop
and head out.

44:15.625 --> 44:17.916
-I feel really underdressed.
-Oh, you're so pretty.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.333
-So gorgeous. Don't be silly.
-Thank you.

44:20.416 --> 44:22.291
Oh, my God, is it your birthday?

44:22.375 --> 44:24.375
Well, it's not my birthday
till next week.

44:24.458 --> 44:27.333
I just like to start
celebrating early, right?

44:27.416 --> 44:29.833
It's such a shame
to only have the one day.

44:29.916 --> 44:33.166
Yeah, well, happy birthday week.
I wish I brought you something.

44:33.250 --> 44:35.041
But you are my birthday gift.

44:36.708 --> 44:39.500
I'm always having get-togethers.

44:39.583 --> 44:43.416
Last-minute soirées help remind
your friends why they adore you.

44:44.375 --> 44:48.375
Thank you. Wow.
This home is incredible.

44:48.458 --> 44:51.041
Please, help yourself
to everything.

44:51.125 --> 44:54.583
I will go
and tell Will you're here.

44:54.666 --> 44:56.416
[laughs]

45:08.583 --> 45:09.791
You made it.

45:11.416 --> 45:14.166
Yeah. Well, didn't wanna
disappoint your mom.

45:14.250 --> 45:15.916
Here I was thinking
you wanted to see me again.

45:16.375 --> 45:19.500
-Why would I wanna see you?
-Dashing good looks.

45:19.583 --> 45:21.333
The fact I've just finished
doing a hundred press-ups

45:21.416 --> 45:22.708
and reading a book
on impressionism.

45:22.791 --> 45:24.375
Press-ups was a nice touch.

45:24.458 --> 45:26.666
Apparently being English
is my only card with you.

45:26.750 --> 45:30.666
Oh, not at all. Free booze,
free food, fancy people.

45:30.750 --> 45:32.083
You've got a full house.

45:32.166 --> 45:33.708
Not sure exactly who's in it

45:33.791 --> 45:35.416
but that's being an actress
for you.

45:35.500 --> 45:36.583
[man] Will! Save me.

45:36.666 --> 45:39.458
This is a disaster.

45:39.541 --> 45:43.416
Michael Faust is holding court
at the bar and I need a refill.

45:43.500 --> 45:46.333
Um, sorry, Ana.
This is Julian Marx.

45:48.375 --> 45:51.166
You're not the Julian Marx,
are you?

45:51.250 --> 45:53.333
The one and only.

45:53.416 --> 45:56.291
Oh, my God. I love your work.

45:56.375 --> 45:59.041
Drunken Wrestlers? I mean, wow.

45:59.125 --> 46:02.750
Erotic and whimsical.
That's really hard to do.

46:02.833 --> 46:05.000
I went to your retrospective
in New York actually.

46:05.083 --> 46:06.250
-Oh, God.
-Oh, wait.

46:06.666 --> 46:09.916
-The retrospective.
-Aren't you supposed to be dead?

46:10.333 --> 46:13.375
This is rather embarrassing,
and you will have to forgive me.

46:13.458 --> 46:17.708
But I thought if I was dead,
I could charge more.

46:17.791 --> 46:19.625
-You did charge more.
-Yes, I did.

46:19.708 --> 46:21.875
And, Ana, you are exactly right.

46:22.375 --> 46:24.666
Most people don't get
the whimsy in my work.

46:24.750 --> 46:26.500
I don't know why. [laughs]

46:26.583 --> 46:29.208
I think it might have something
to do with the erotic aspect.

46:29.291 --> 46:32.291
I think penises
can be very whimsical.

46:33.333 --> 46:35.541
William, my father's dream
has come to life.

46:35.625 --> 46:37.291
I finally love a woman.

46:37.375 --> 46:38.666
-[laughs]
-I love you.

46:38.750 --> 46:40.583
-Let's get drunk.
-Let's get drunk.

46:44.750 --> 46:45.916
Oh.

46:46.791 --> 46:48.583
Thank you very much.

46:48.666 --> 46:51.958
Leave the fox alone, please.
It's done nothing to you.

46:52.041 --> 46:53.541
I like it
when you're embarrassed.

46:53.625 --> 46:54.958
-[phone rings]
-Imagine this.

46:55.041 --> 46:58.291
-It's really fun for me.
-My whole life, with these two.

46:58.375 --> 47:00.416
-[phone rings]
-And anyone that I...

47:00.500 --> 47:01.666
Excuse me. Sorry.

47:04.125 --> 47:06.416
Hello. Hi, this is Ana Santos.

47:06.500 --> 47:08.875
[Suzette] Yeah, I know who
this is, dipshit. I called you.

47:08.958 --> 47:11.000
-Right, sorry.
-Where are you?

47:11.083 --> 47:12.291
Are you at a party?

47:12.375 --> 47:15.333
Uh, no. Um, I'm not.
I'm at the hotel.

47:15.416 --> 47:16.625
The one you booked at...

47:16.708 --> 47:20.375
The one you booked me at
is, um, right next to a bar.

47:20.458 --> 47:22.625
OK, listen. I've been stuck
for the last 18 hours

47:22.708 --> 47:24.208
trying to get these stupid

47:24.291 --> 47:27.041
"Midsummer Night"
Shakespeare ticket bullshit.

47:27.125 --> 47:28.208
OK?

47:28.291 --> 47:30.958
I need you to finish my
other work while I keep trying.

47:31.041 --> 47:34.541
-I'm forwarding the details.
-Oh, I'm kind of busy right now,

47:34.625 --> 47:37.375
dealing with something
for Catherine...

47:37.458 --> 47:38.583
I mean, Claire.

47:38.666 --> 47:41.500
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you not
actually wanna have a job?

47:41.583 --> 47:44.000
You're a third assistant.
Your job is to help me.

47:44.083 --> 47:46.416
No, right. Of course.
Um, happy to help.

47:46.500 --> 47:47.750
What do you need?

47:47.833 --> 47:50.000
I literally just told you.
It's in your inbox.

47:50.083 --> 47:51.083
Now go do it.

47:51.166 --> 47:52.875
-OK. do you wanna...
-[Suzette hangs up]

48:06.375 --> 48:08.750
Ah, there you are.

48:08.833 --> 48:11.583
So, the two of you met
on the plane.

48:11.666 --> 48:15.000
Yeah, we did. Do you
actually know where Will is?

48:15.083 --> 48:16.666
I need him to grab my laptop.

48:16.750 --> 48:18.833
Well, I sent him off
to find absinthe.

48:19.791 --> 48:21.041
A dead painter
can't live without it.

48:21.125 --> 48:22.041
[laughs]

48:22.125 --> 48:23.833
[Julian]
So, are you expecting to do

48:23.916 --> 48:26.250
anything exciting
while you're here?

48:26.333 --> 48:29.125
I don't know. I think
I'll be too busy with work.

48:29.208 --> 48:32.541
That's a shame.
London is such a vibrant city.

48:33.500 --> 48:36.666
Actually, there is something
I wanna do while I'm here.

48:36.750 --> 48:38.708
I'm trying to get tickets
to go see

48:38.791 --> 48:41.500
Midsummer Night's Dream,
but it's completely sold out

48:41.583 --> 48:43.250
and my assistants
have had trouble...

48:43.333 --> 48:45.625
I can just get the tickets
for you myself.

48:45.708 --> 48:46.875
-Catherine!
-Oh.

48:47.541 --> 48:48.791
Julian!

48:49.250 --> 48:50.375
[laughs]

48:51.333 --> 48:52.791
-Hello.
-Hi.

48:52.875 --> 48:55.375
Oh, good. You've met Ana.

48:55.458 --> 48:58.041
-Oh.
-Isn't she darling?

48:58.125 --> 48:59.791
She is wonderful.

48:59.875 --> 49:01.291
What have we been discussing?

49:01.791 --> 49:02.958
-Well...
-[Will] Julian.

49:03.041 --> 49:05.416
Sorry, but it looks like
we're fresh out of absinthe.

49:05.500 --> 49:06.750
[groans]

49:06.833 --> 49:08.833
Well, there are now
two problems we have

49:08.916 --> 49:10.833
that I think
you can help us with.

49:10.916 --> 49:13.125
Item number one,
our darling Ana here

49:13.208 --> 49:16.625
can't get tickets to Midsummer
Nighty-Night's Dream.

49:16.708 --> 49:19.333
I'll call Kenneth tomorrow,
dear. It shouldn't be a problem.

49:19.416 --> 49:21.916
I really didn't wanna make
this a thing on your birthday.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.625
Will's office is down the street
from the theatre.

49:24.708 --> 49:27.250
-He can pick them up for you.
-[Will] Oh, can I?

49:27.333 --> 49:29.833
Right, yeah. Of course I will.
No problem at all.

49:30.750 --> 49:35.000
[Julian] Item number two,
I require some absinthe.

49:35.083 --> 49:36.625
[Catherine] I see. Hmm.

49:37.208 --> 49:41.208
I think I may have a bottle
tucked away...

49:42.083 --> 49:43.541
[laughs]

49:43.625 --> 49:45.375
-...in the library.
-[laughs]

49:45.458 --> 49:47.291
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to be a buzzkill,

49:47.375 --> 49:49.916
but I have a lot of work
left to do tonight.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.375
-Boo!
-Ooh!

49:51.458 --> 49:53.833
-[laughs] Yeah.
-Oh, and your laptop.

49:53.916 --> 49:57.416
Right, I will grab it and then
I will meet you in the library.

49:57.500 --> 49:59.125
-Yes.
-Oh, I should go with you.

49:59.208 --> 50:01.000
-Oh, no, no, no, no.
-No!

50:01.083 --> 50:03.041
You're staying here
with the fun team,

50:03.125 --> 50:04.500
and we can go together.

50:08.375 --> 50:09.541
Wait.

50:11.333 --> 50:12.541
Are these originals?

50:13.333 --> 50:15.416
-Uh-huh.
-That's a Renoir.

50:15.500 --> 50:20.041
And they're just hanging in this
room that you never come into?

50:20.125 --> 50:23.375
-[Catherine] Mm.
-Wow.

50:24.333 --> 50:26.250
-That's a Cézanne.
-[Catherine] Yeah.

50:26.333 --> 50:28.125
Why don't you ever come in here?

50:28.208 --> 50:29.916
Well, this was Boris's office.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.083
He was my third husband,
and he passed away last year.

50:34.166 --> 50:35.958
Oh, I'm sorry.

50:36.041 --> 50:37.791
He left the paintings to me.

50:37.875 --> 50:41.541
I always felt they were... dark.

50:41.625 --> 50:44.708
No. No, no, no, no, no.
These are not dark at all.

50:44.791 --> 50:48.416
Each one of these paintings
depicts love.

50:48.500 --> 50:50.625
-Love?
-I think it's clear

50:50.708 --> 50:53.000
your husband was a romantic.

50:53.083 --> 50:54.416
He was not. He was Russian.

50:55.791 --> 50:58.625
Well, this collection
tells a story of love.

50:59.750 --> 51:03.500
Really. Like that one,
for example, is unrequited love.

51:03.583 --> 51:07.208
And those three over there,
the nudes, passionate love.

51:07.750 --> 51:10.666
And this woman
by her lover's deathbed,

51:11.333 --> 51:13.583
undying love.

51:14.291 --> 51:15.500
It's all love.

51:15.583 --> 51:17.666
[Catherine] I've never
thought about it that way.

51:17.750 --> 51:19.958
You really know
what you're talking about.

51:20.041 --> 51:23.541
I'd hope so, considering
she does it for a living.

51:24.833 --> 51:27.500
She's a director
of an auction house in New York.

51:27.583 --> 51:29.500
[Julian] The people in charge
just get younger and younger.

51:29.583 --> 51:31.625
-Which house?
-Sorry?

51:32.083 --> 51:33.541
Which house?

51:34.500 --> 51:36.375
Uh, Erwins.

51:37.333 --> 51:38.791
[gasps]

51:39.291 --> 51:41.208
Well, that's incredible.

51:41.791 --> 51:45.541
Really, this is serendipitous.

51:45.625 --> 51:50.916
I recently asked Erwins
to auction these for me.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.583
[Will] Oh, you're selling these?

51:52.666 --> 51:55.083
Oh, that's good. We never
really liked them, did we?

51:55.166 --> 51:56.875
Erwins is auctioning
this collection?

51:56.958 --> 52:00.500
-Yes! Isn't that fun?
-[Julian] So fun!

52:00.583 --> 52:01.541
Yes!

52:02.375 --> 52:03.500
So, I'm sorry.

52:03.583 --> 52:06.125
Your last name is Brovil?

52:06.208 --> 52:08.791
Cause I just assumed
it was, it was DeLaroche.

52:08.875 --> 52:11.708
Well, technically, it's Brovil.
I just thought DeLaroche

52:11.791 --> 52:14.666
so much more appropriate
to the marquee.

52:15.625 --> 52:17.625
This is the Brovil collection.

52:18.125 --> 52:20.375
I'm confused. You didn't know?

52:21.333 --> 52:23.166
No, I mean...

52:24.708 --> 52:25.916
It's just that I'm...

52:26.000 --> 52:29.708
I'm not exactly the point person
for this collection.

52:29.791 --> 52:33.625
They send me over here
to help with other clients.

52:33.708 --> 52:35.333
It's all a team effort.

52:35.416 --> 52:38.250
Claire Dupont is the one
they've had me working with,

52:38.333 --> 52:39.791
but I'd rather have you.

52:39.875 --> 52:41.708
I'm going to ask Arnold tomorrow

52:41.791 --> 52:44.583
to put you
in charge of my auction.

52:44.666 --> 52:48.458
No! Please, don't.
Please, don't.

52:48.541 --> 52:52.208
It's just that,
Mr Penker, Arnold,

52:52.291 --> 52:54.250
Arnie, as I like to call him,

52:54.333 --> 52:56.375
he's very protective
of this collection at the moment

52:56.458 --> 53:01.250
and, um, I would get
in serious, serious trouble

53:01.333 --> 53:04.708
if anybody over there knew
I was even talking to you.

53:05.666 --> 53:08.291
Oh, yes. That's right.
He explained all that.

53:08.375 --> 53:12.291
It's all very... Shh. Hush-hush.

53:12.375 --> 53:15.416
[Ana] Yes, yes.
Very, very hush-hush.

53:15.500 --> 53:19.375
I promise, Catherine, you are in
very great hands with Claire.

53:19.458 --> 53:22.208
There is no one better suited
to this deal.

53:22.291 --> 53:25.166
To be honest,
she's very old school,

53:25.250 --> 53:27.625
and I'm sort of
the young whippersnapper

53:27.708 --> 53:29.125
stepping on her toes.

53:29.208 --> 53:31.708
I wouldn't want her to think
that I'm poaching

53:31.791 --> 53:34.708
or disrespecting her
in any way.

53:34.791 --> 53:36.625
Cause that would be
really bad for me.

53:36.708 --> 53:38.125
-And for the company.
-Oh.

53:38.208 --> 53:39.500
Yeah.

53:40.291 --> 53:41.541
Very bad.

53:41.625 --> 53:44.375
Very cut-throat,
the art business.

53:44.458 --> 53:46.583
[laughs] Yeah.

53:46.666 --> 53:50.500
Ana, if you can't work on
my auction, at the very least,

53:50.583 --> 53:53.083
you must come out with us again
tomorrow night.

53:53.166 --> 53:54.875
There's an event
at the Southbank.

53:54.958 --> 53:58.166
Another artsy party, I'm afraid,
but everyone will be there.

53:58.250 --> 54:01.500
Ana has to see this gallery,
and you must take her.

54:01.583 --> 54:04.291
Or she could get swept off
her feet by some other chap,

54:04.375 --> 54:05.583
and then, where will you be?

54:05.666 --> 54:07.625
-Where will you be?
-In the pub.

54:07.708 --> 54:08.791
This all sounds great

54:08.875 --> 54:11.541
and, despite this
incredible evening,

54:11.625 --> 54:13.458
I'm not really here on holiday.

54:13.541 --> 54:15.208
Oh, well,
if you both don't come,

54:15.291 --> 54:17.500
it will put me off
the whole night. Will.

54:17.583 --> 54:21.541
Relax! You're spectacular
with pressure, I must say.

Either way, I'm so glad
you could make it tonight.

for Midsummer with Will.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.375
And you two can figure it out,
right?

54:30.458 --> 54:33.625
Thank you so much
for everything, Catherine.

54:33.708 --> 54:35.666
And, please,
if you could refrain

54:35.750 --> 54:37.375
from mentioning any of this...

54:37.458 --> 54:39.125
Ana Santos? Never heard of her.

-Bye.

Lovely meeting you, Julian.

56:11.750 --> 56:14.500
It's a must-win
if we want to be champions, OK?

56:14.583 --> 56:15.875
Who's she?

56:18.458 --> 56:21.000
You seem a little old
to be playing with these guys.

56:21.083 --> 56:23.375
I only play at training.
But apart from that,

56:23.458 --> 56:25.708
I am the head coach,
head manager, head cheerleader.

56:25.791 --> 56:29.166
Wow. Seems like
a lot of responsibility.

56:29.250 --> 56:30.458
What are you guys called?

56:30.541 --> 56:32.375
[all] The Lions!

Especially that one.
He actually bites.

Right, on my whistle.

56:47.541 --> 56:48.791
-What's this?
-It's a whistle.

56:48.875 --> 56:50.125
-What do I do?
-Blow it.

56:51.750 --> 56:53.791

-That was good.

56:54.375 --> 56:57.000

that's just for fun.

57:04.750 --> 57:07.541
No, this... This is my real job.

-What? What am I doing?

youth football team

57:31.583 --> 57:33.958
OK. This nerdy type
has to go back to work,

57:34.041 --> 57:35.625
so if you could kindly
give me those tickets,

57:35.708 --> 57:36.875
I'll be on my way.

57:36.958 --> 57:38.666
-Right. About that.
-Oh, no.

57:38.750 --> 57:41.000
No, I have them. I thought
we could get lunch first.

57:42.291 --> 57:44.250
-Lunch?
-Yeah.

57:44.333 --> 57:46.041
I barely had time
to meet you here.

57:46.125 --> 57:47.750
You don't have time for lunch?

57:47.833 --> 57:50.625
Oh. Well, you should've just
sent one of your assistants then.

57:50.708 --> 57:55.208
[laughs] Well, I don't know.
I just wanted to see you.

57:56.166 --> 57:57.708
In that case,
I'll walk you back.

OK.

Follow me.

58:04.458 --> 58:05.708
I'll give you the tickets,

58:05.791 --> 58:07.666
but you've gotta promise
to be my date tonight.

58:07.750 --> 58:10.041
Tell your mom I say thank you,

58:10.125 --> 58:12.500
and I will consider
being your date tonight.

It's at the Southbank.

that likes that sort of thing.

58:16.375 --> 58:18.583
There'll be nothing there
that I like unless you show.

58:18.666 --> 58:21.250
I will see
if I can get off early.

58:21.333 --> 58:23.791
We're actually really busy
planning the Brovil collection.

58:24.666 --> 58:27.958
Listen, I will get my mum
to cancel the whole bloody thing

58:28.041 --> 58:29.541
if it will free up
your schedule.

58:30.500 --> 58:33.833
Uh, you don't have to do that.
I can probably go.

58:33.916 --> 58:36.500
Then I'll pick you up
at your hotel at eight.

58:36.583 --> 58:37.750
Don't come to the hotel.

58:37.833 --> 58:39.791
If I go, I will meet you there.

58:40.625 --> 58:43.458
-OK.
-Oh, before I forget.

58:43.541 --> 58:47.125
Oh, no, no, no. You can keep it,
you can keep it as a memento.

you'll think of me.

Claire, I'm so sorry. It was
impossible. I called everyone.

special project that I gave you?

59:42.541 --> 59:43.708
Finished.

I emailed you the spreadsheet
with the final numbers.

I did the painting descriptions.

I am only here to help.

to my clients last year?

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:16.500
Yeah, we could. We could.

01:05:17.541 --> 01:05:19.000
Wouldn't that be faster?

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:20.541
Yeah, it definitely would be,

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:23.208
but, um, then we wouldn't be
able to walk together.

01:05:25.125 --> 01:05:26.083
Hmm.

01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:30.875
Here, look, you can take this.

01:05:40.291 --> 01:05:43.166
-[Will] Well, here we are.
-[Ana] Yep.

01:05:43.708 --> 01:05:45.541
Your beautiful hotel.

01:05:46.666 --> 01:05:48.291
My beautiful hotel.

01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:53.083
Gonna invite me inside?

01:05:53.166 --> 01:05:55.750
Excuse me? Very forward.

01:05:55.833 --> 01:05:58.125
What happened to your manners,
Downton Abbey?

01:05:58.208 --> 01:06:00.125
I'm more
of a Bridgerton man myself.

01:06:00.208 --> 01:06:01.291
Hmm.

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:10.000
Sorry. I gotta go up.

01:06:10.083 --> 01:06:12.250
I have a lot of work to do
tonight.

01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:16.500
Oh. Here I was, thinking
you were taking the night off.

01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:19.333
-I did.
-OK, fine. Fine.

01:06:20.541 --> 01:06:25.166
Well, I guess we'll just have
to wait until date number three.

01:06:26.125 --> 01:06:27.541
We'll see.

01:06:30.333 --> 01:06:32.416
You know
the last time I was here,

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.041
I was meant
to tell you something.

01:06:34.125 --> 01:06:35.541
What's that?

01:06:38.125 --> 01:06:40.625
You still need to pay me back
for the shoes.

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:42.083
You're done.

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:59.500
OK. I should go up.

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:00.458
Oh, you're killing me.

01:07:00.541 --> 01:07:01.916
-[laughs]
-You are.

01:07:09.166 --> 01:07:10.083
OK.

01:07:14.083 --> 01:07:15.375
Goodnight, Will.

01:07:32.666 --> 01:07:34.208
[exhales deeply]

01:07:35.333 --> 01:07:37.625

[exhales deeply]

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:45.000
-Sorry.
-Not at all.

01:07:46.458 --> 01:07:48.625
-It's nothing really.
-OK.

01:07:50.583 --> 01:07:52.791
I just made out
with, like, a solid ten.

01:07:52.875 --> 01:07:54.458
-Ten?
-Ten.

01:07:54.541 --> 01:07:56.208
-Nice.
-Yeah.

01:07:56.291 --> 01:07:57.916
[doorman]
Can I get you something?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Oh, no. I'm just waiting
for him to leave.

01:08:00.083 --> 01:08:02.375
-Oh. Do you not like him?
-I like him a lot,

01:08:02.875 --> 01:08:05.291
but he thinks I'm staying here,
and I'm not.

01:08:05.375 --> 01:08:06.750
-Right.
-Yeah.

01:08:07.958 --> 01:08:09.875
-Can I get you a cab?
-That'd be great.

01:08:10.416 --> 01:08:11.833
Thank you.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.958
-Are you gonna see him again?
-I don't know.

01:08:16.916 --> 01:08:18.375
Not sure I'll have time.

[♪ "Iceblink Luck"

01:08:32.416 --> 01:08:34.832
Hi, yeah. I was just wondering
if I could get a reservation

01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:36.875
for two sometime this week.

01:08:38.207 --> 01:08:40.000
Oh, Wednesday would be perfect.

01:08:41.332 --> 01:08:43.582
I'm sorry, two months? Yeah.

01:08:43.666 --> 01:08:46.082
-No, that's not gonna work.
-Ana, give me the phone.

01:08:46.166 --> 01:08:47.666
-Uh, one second.
-Give me the phone.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.457
Hello. Hi, is that Casey?

01:08:51.416 --> 01:08:53.500
Casey, it's Will DeLaroche.

01:08:53.582 --> 01:08:56.332
Do you think you might be able
to do me a massive favour?

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:03.416
I got you the reservation.

[♪ "Iceblink Luck"

01:09:43.582 --> 01:09:48.291
So, this job in New York.

01:09:49.375 --> 01:09:50.541
If I get the offer.

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.166
-If you get the offer...
-Mm-hmm.

01:09:53.875 --> 01:09:57.333
...is it something
you might actually take?

01:09:57.416 --> 01:09:59.833
Well, it's looking
more and more attractive.

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:03.166
Why would you wanna
move to New York

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:05.958
when your life here in London
is so incredible?

01:10:06.041 --> 01:10:07.208
I want...

01:10:09.375 --> 01:10:10.833
So, my mum's birthday party
the other day...

01:10:10.916 --> 01:10:12.500
Mmm.

01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:13.875
It's been like that
my whole life.

01:10:13.958 --> 01:10:16.208
You know what it's like,
the scene, the people.

01:10:16.291 --> 01:10:17.750
They're trying to use you

01:10:17.833 --> 01:10:19.583
to get to whatever it is
that they're after.

01:10:19.666 --> 01:10:21.000
And, in my case,

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:24.458
it just so happens to be,
embarrassingly enough, my mum.

01:10:24.541 --> 01:10:26.125
And that gets old.

01:10:27.083 --> 01:10:29.583
And that is why
you are such an anomaly.

01:10:30.708 --> 01:10:32.833
What makes me an anomaly?

01:10:32.916 --> 01:10:34.875
You're rich, successful.

01:10:34.958 --> 01:10:37.583
You're the youngest director
this company has ever had.

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:40.416
And yet, you're still,
like, a real person.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.750
And I've seen money
change people.

01:10:42.833 --> 01:10:44.750
I've seen them turn to monsters
like that and..

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:49.041
You're still just real.

01:10:50.541 --> 01:10:51.666
And that means a lot.

01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:55.541
Right, so here's to hoping

01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:57.708
that I get this job.

01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:03.333
Here's hoping.

01:11:06.166 --> 01:11:07.416

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:11.166
I talked to William DeLaroche
at the Southbank Friday night.

-Catherine's son?
-Mm-hmm. He was all over me.

-Ah. Good morning, Ana.
-Morning.

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:21.208
Would you come into my office
and close the door behind you?

I'm really into... [exhales]

Um... I'm just... I'm just...
I'm confused.

what are we doing?

I see how hard
you've been working.

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:43.541
I notice it every day.

01:12:44.083 --> 01:12:46.250
I want you to know
it's appreciated

01:12:46.333 --> 01:12:50.750
and then, when I take over,
it will be rewarded.

DeLaroche just cancelled
the auction.

01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:37.583
What? What did she say?

01:13:37.666 --> 01:13:40.166
[Claire] She got very
sentimental about the paintings.

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.416
Something about
the "love hidden within."

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:45.000
Some fucking hippie bullshit!

01:13:46.625 --> 01:13:48.041
But what I do know...

01:13:49.375 --> 01:13:52.750
is no one gives up millions
of dollars for no reason.

01:13:52.833 --> 01:13:55.541
-Someone got in her ear.
-Sotheby's.

01:13:58.375 --> 01:13:59.958
Fuck!

01:14:00.333 --> 01:14:03.166
It could be another collector
trying to swoop in

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:05.333
and buy everything from her,
but without us.

01:14:05.416 --> 01:14:08.500
All it takes is one idiot
with one stupid comment

01:14:08.583 --> 01:14:10.541
to make her
lose confidence in us.

01:14:10.625 --> 01:14:13.583
You! You said that

01:14:13.666 --> 01:14:16.083
you saw her son William
at the gallery the other night.

01:14:16.166 --> 01:14:19.166
Did he say anything
about a cancellation?

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:21.791
I actually, um...

01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:23.708
I didn't talk to him.
I made that up.

01:14:25.125 --> 01:14:28.416
-What's wrong with you?
-So many things.

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:30.625
OK.

01:14:32.541 --> 01:14:34.791
Everybody's one and only job

01:14:34.875 --> 01:14:37.875
is to find out
who's behind this cancellation.

01:14:37.958 --> 01:14:41.375
[Arnold] These paintings have
been off the market for decades.

01:14:41.916 --> 01:14:43.791
If Sotheby's took this from us,

01:14:43.875 --> 01:14:47.166
they'll laugh all the way
to the bank.

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:50.708
Now, you
tell me you can fix this.

01:14:50.791 --> 01:14:52.458
I can fix this.

01:14:54.166 --> 01:14:55.208
I always do.

01:14:55.666 --> 01:14:57.625

at the front desk for ya.

01:15:06.791 --> 01:15:09.208
-Who's that?
-Thing for Claire. Don't worry.

01:15:15.208 --> 01:15:16.625
Thought I'd make a bold gesture.

01:15:18.291 --> 01:15:19.166
Come here.

01:15:24.208 --> 01:15:26.833
-Hang on a minute.
-Just keep walking.

01:15:28.416 --> 01:15:29.416
What are you doing here?

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.000
Just thought I'd surprise you
for lunch.

01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:34.083
You can't just show up here
unannounced.

01:15:34.166 --> 01:15:36.750
-What? I don't understand.
-You don't understand?

01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:39.458
You don't understand
how inappropriate it is

01:15:39.541 --> 01:15:41.333
to show up here
the day that your mom

01:15:41.416 --> 01:15:43.375
pulls her collection
from our auction?

01:15:43.458 --> 01:15:44.958
Ana, that has nothing
to do with me.

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:46.583
I have no idea
what she's doing with all that.

01:15:46.666 --> 01:15:47.916
Nothing to do with you?

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.833
You're her son.
I work for Erwins.

01:15:49.916 --> 01:15:52.916
This was such a bad idea to
begin with. I'm such an idiot!

01:15:53.333 --> 01:15:55.833
Let's not get hyperbolic.
So she pulled a few pieces,

01:15:55.916 --> 01:15:58.666
or whatever...
It's not the end of the world.

01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:00.291
I mean, you do these
all the time anyway.

01:16:00.875 --> 01:16:02.583
Just because you don't
give a shit, Will,

01:16:02.666 --> 01:16:04.583
doesn't mean it doesn't matter.

01:16:05.541 --> 01:16:08.875
This shit matters to me. I give
a shit. I give a lot of shits.

01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:10.666
This was the biggest auction
of my career.

01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:12.250
And I put it at risk
because I thought

01:16:12.333 --> 01:16:13.708
you and your mom
understood that.

01:16:14.666 --> 01:16:17.166
I'm sorry. I didn't know that it
meant that much to you, Ana.

01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:18.208
It does.

01:16:18.625 --> 01:16:20.083
Honestly,
I came here to tell you

01:16:20.166 --> 01:16:22.625
that I got the job offer
from the firm in New York.

01:16:23.583 --> 01:16:28.333
[laughs] That's great.
That's really great, um...

01:16:28.416 --> 01:16:30.208
I wish I could be happier
for you,

01:16:30.291 --> 01:16:32.333
but while you get an offer
for a job

01:16:32.416 --> 01:16:35.458
that you've literally never
needed, now mine is at risk.

01:16:35.541 --> 01:16:36.833
Never needed?

01:16:37.875 --> 01:16:39.416
[Ana] This was such a mistake.

01:16:41.666 --> 01:16:44.708
No, I think the only mistake
here was me not realising

01:16:44.791 --> 01:16:47.416
that this entire relationship
was based on whether or not

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.166
you were getting something
in return.

01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:50.875
Will.

01:16:50.958 --> 01:16:54.458
Tickets, invitations, attention.
Joke.

01:16:54.541 --> 01:16:56.291
-Will.
-Good luck to you.

01:17:03.833 --> 01:17:06.208
[loud chatter]

01:17:10.666 --> 01:17:12.166
[phone pings]

01:17:40.708 --> 01:17:42.208
[Arnold] Ms Santos!

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:48.166
A word, please.

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:54.875
-Quite the photo.
-Claire, I can explain.

01:17:54.958 --> 01:18:00.375
No, I'll explain. In this photo,
you're wearing my dress.

01:18:00.458 --> 01:18:02.958
You're the director
of Erwins New York

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.291
having such a wonderful time
with our client.

01:18:06.375 --> 01:18:10.291
It's so strange because I'm the
director of Erwins New York.

01:18:10.375 --> 01:18:13.333
But I'm so glad that
it's you in this photo.

01:18:13.416 --> 01:18:15.458
Since Catherine
pulled the collection,

01:18:15.541 --> 01:18:18.666
you're really doing
an incredibly shit job.

01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:21.916
I know that I probably
look crazy right now,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.458
but I promise I never intended
for any of this to happen.

01:18:24.541 --> 01:18:27.083
I met Catherine's son
on the plane

01:18:27.166 --> 01:18:30.208
and he misinterpreted something
I said. It was an accident.

01:18:30.291 --> 01:18:34.416
It's not an accident. You lied.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:38.041
You lied your way
into Catherine's confidence.

01:18:39.666 --> 01:18:42.541
You pretended to have my job.

01:18:42.625 --> 01:18:46.291
You shimmied your way
into my couture.

01:18:46.375 --> 01:18:49.166
It's a shame you couldn't have
something like my competence.

01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:51.583
Catherine is not responding.

01:18:51.666 --> 01:18:53.375
Let me deal with Catherine.
I can fix this, trust me.

01:18:53.791 --> 01:18:55.958
"Trust" is not the word
that comes to mind, darling.

01:18:56.041 --> 01:18:58.666
Suzette, I want her on a plane.
I want her out of here now.

01:18:58.750 --> 01:19:00.958
-My pleasure.
-Call security.

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.791
[Gerard] Excuse me, Claire,

01:19:02.875 --> 01:19:06.000
but you really had no idea
she was masquerading as you?

01:19:06.083 --> 01:19:07.916
You fuck off, Gerard.

01:19:09.375 --> 01:19:11.125
A lot of people want to be me.

01:19:11.208 --> 01:19:13.416
How can that be possible
with you, Claire?

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:14.541
I was called to Rome.

01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:16.166
Oh, you're suggesting
I'm to blame?

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:18.583
-Well, it certainly didn't help.
-[Arnold] Excuse me.

01:19:18.666 --> 01:19:20.166
I've got to start
cleaning up your mess.

01:19:20.583 --> 01:19:23.916
Gerard is taking point in the
auction until I figure this out.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.250
[Gerard]
You're making this too easy.

01:19:26.333 --> 01:19:29.833
Bravo, Gerard. Remove her.
She no longer works at Erwins.

01:19:30.875 --> 01:19:32.250
Claire...

01:19:33.958 --> 01:19:35.916
Claire,
I'm so unbelievably sorry.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.166
Uh-huh.

01:19:43.916 --> 01:19:46.750
You're a terrible waste
of potential.

01:20:22.541 --> 01:20:25.375
I'm so sorry, bud. I wish
I could be there to help.

01:20:25.458 --> 01:20:28.625
I know, Viv.
I wish you were here too.

01:20:29.208 --> 01:20:30.958
-[squealing]
-What was that?

01:20:31.416 --> 01:20:34.375
Listen, I hate to tell you this
on the worst day of your life,

01:20:34.458 --> 01:20:39.083
but... Ronnie and I
got a Great Dane!

01:20:39.166 --> 01:20:40.333
-Wait, what?
-[squeals]

01:20:40.416 --> 01:20:43.833
This is Mario! He lives here
instead of you now.

01:20:43.916 --> 01:20:47.500
Mario is our baby, and you know
how little space we have.

01:20:47.958 --> 01:20:49.916
So why would you get
a Great Dane?

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.791
But it's OK.
I'm gonna take all your stuff

01:20:51.875 --> 01:20:53.875
and put it in a crate
and put it out in the hallway.

01:20:53.958 --> 01:20:55.166
Ronnie!
She's having a hard time.

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:56.541
It's OK.

01:20:56.625 --> 01:20:58.708
I've literally just been
thrown out on the street

01:20:58.791 --> 01:21:00.375
and I'm being replaced
by a Great Dane.

01:21:00.458 --> 01:21:02.458
-Aw...
-There's always the navy.

01:21:02.541 --> 01:21:05.000
-[hangs up]
-[sighs]

01:21:10.458 --> 01:21:11.541
[phone pings]

01:21:14.791 --> 01:21:17.500
[man] The best decision
I ever made? That's easy.

01:21:17.583 --> 01:21:19.916
I joined the US Navy.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:37.708
[sighs]

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:55.250
[exhales]

01:21:55.333 --> 01:22:00.416
No, they didn't fire me because
I was hanging out with a client

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.083
I wasn't supposed to know.

01:22:02.166 --> 01:22:04.333
No, they fired me because...

01:22:06.291 --> 01:22:09.416
because I was
impersonating my boss.

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:10.458
[gasps]

01:22:12.791 --> 01:22:14.625
I'm not a director at Erwins.

01:22:14.708 --> 01:22:17.166
[chuckles] I'm not even close
to being a director at Erwins.

01:22:21.083 --> 01:22:22.500
Before I came to London,

01:22:22.583 --> 01:22:28.000
I was handing out catalogues
and paddles

01:22:28.083 --> 01:22:29.958
and folding chairs.

01:22:31.708 --> 01:22:33.458
They fired me because I lied.

01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:39.875
I'm realising that pretending
to be more than I am

01:22:39.958 --> 01:22:44.208
got me further in a week
than being myself did in a year.

01:22:45.666 --> 01:22:46.958
I lied, Catherine,

01:22:47.041 --> 01:22:51.583
because I wanted to live
somebody else's life for once

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:55.541
because I am so insecure
of my own.

01:22:58.416 --> 01:23:01.500
I'm really surprised
by all of this, Ana.

01:23:01.583 --> 01:23:04.125
I thought I knew you.

01:23:04.208 --> 01:23:08.250
For all we know, she even
made up the name Ana Santos.

01:23:08.333 --> 01:23:10.125
No. Ana's my name, Ana Santos.

01:23:10.208 --> 01:23:11.791
Oh, well, thank God for that.

01:23:11.875 --> 01:23:13.708
We've got something real
to work with.

01:23:13.791 --> 01:23:17.083
I really don't know what to say,
to be honest.

01:23:17.166 --> 01:23:18.208
What do you think, Julian?

01:23:18.291 --> 01:23:20.250
Shocked.

01:23:20.333 --> 01:23:21.791
[Catherine] Wildly shocked, yes.

01:23:21.875 --> 01:23:24.000
-Unbelievably shocked.
-Incredibly shocked.

01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:25.250
[Julian] Hmm!

01:23:30.583 --> 01:23:32.000
Encore!

01:23:32.083 --> 01:23:36.291
-[clapping continues]
-Bravo! Well done.

01:23:36.875 --> 01:23:38.958
Pretending to be other people

01:23:39.041 --> 01:23:40.541
is supposed to be
what I do for a living.

01:23:40.625 --> 01:23:41.625
[Julian chuckles]

01:23:41.708 --> 01:23:42.666
You're not mad?

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.083
Well, some people
have called me mad.

01:23:45.166 --> 01:23:46.583
-Do you think I'm mad?
-Barking.

01:23:46.666 --> 01:23:49.708
I'm just an admirer
of a good performance.

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:50.958
You should be in the theatre.

01:23:51.041 --> 01:23:54.708
You would still be poor but
you'd get in a lot less trouble.

01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:57.750
Darling, you should know,
none of this is your fault.

01:23:57.833 --> 01:24:00.166
That's very nice, Catherine,
but...

01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:04.041
I'm not being nice.
I was using you.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.500
-Using me?
-Mm-hmm.

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:09.833
-It was all a sales strategy.
-[Catherine laughs]

01:24:09.916 --> 01:24:11.416
A what?

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:14.125
[Catherine] When I was a young,
I found myself in Casablanca.

01:24:14.208 --> 01:24:16.333
-Great movie.
-Shut up, Julian.

01:24:16.416 --> 01:24:19.166
I lived in Morocco.

01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:21.625
And I learned how to bargain
at the Grand Bazaar.

01:24:22.583 --> 01:24:23.541
One of the most
important things:

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:28.083
right before concluding a deal,
try to walk away.

01:24:28.166 --> 01:24:31.875
If they're convinced
that you will actually leave,

01:24:31.958 --> 01:24:34.041
they might just make
a better offer.

01:24:35.666 --> 01:24:40.041
What about Boris? I thought this
was all because of what I said.

01:24:40.125 --> 01:24:42.083
I knew Boris a bit better
than you, darling.

01:24:42.166 --> 01:24:44.291
I mean, I was married to him,
for God's sake.

01:24:44.375 --> 01:24:46.958
The only thing that man
cared about and loved was money.

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:50.875
It wasn't like I thought
anyone would get hurt.

01:24:51.458 --> 01:24:54.458
So none of this is my fault?

01:24:54.541 --> 01:24:56.708
You're talented.

01:24:56.791 --> 01:25:01.041
But it takes a bit more than
some soft words about paintings

01:25:01.125 --> 01:25:06.416
to make me turn down
£85 million.

01:25:06.833 --> 01:25:08.708
I've decided
I want a beach house.

01:25:08.791 --> 01:25:12.458
-[laughs]
-In Spain. I do.

01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:15.208
So... what are you saying?

01:25:15.291 --> 01:25:17.500
I think it's time
we go down there

01:25:17.583 --> 01:25:19.500
and get this auction on track.

01:25:19.583 --> 01:25:21.666
-For less commission.
-Of course.

01:25:22.041 --> 01:25:23.333
I can't go back to Erwins.

01:25:23.416 --> 01:25:25.958
I just got escorted out
by security.

01:25:26.041 --> 01:25:27.833
You're absolutely right.

01:25:27.916 --> 01:25:32.166
You cannot go back to Erwins
with paint all over your bottom.

01:25:32.250 --> 01:25:36.000
Um, permission to raid
the closet?

01:25:36.958 --> 01:25:38.708
Permission granted.

01:25:38.791 --> 01:25:40.833
[typing]

01:25:44.833 --> 01:25:46.416
-[gasps]
-Security!

01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:49.375
Hello.

01:25:50.333 --> 01:25:53.375
Catherine.
So nice of you to make it.

01:25:56.083 --> 01:25:58.708
Julian, old boy.
You look splendid.

01:25:58.791 --> 01:26:01.416
-I heard you were dead.
-Not as dead as this deal was

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.458
before young Ana here
talked me round.

01:26:04.541 --> 01:26:07.291
-What's she doing here?
-Ana's with me.

01:26:08.083 --> 01:26:10.250
-What can I do for you?
-Well...

01:26:12.291 --> 01:26:14.625
I would like to go ahead
with the auction...

01:26:14.708 --> 01:26:16.458
[sighs]

01:26:16.541 --> 01:26:18.250
...with one minor change.

01:26:19.208 --> 01:26:20.833
OK.

01:26:20.916 --> 01:26:25.833
I'm too... personally attached.

01:26:25.916 --> 01:26:30.708
I'm appointing someone to manage
the auction on my behalf.

01:26:30.791 --> 01:26:32.458
Someone I trust.

01:26:32.541 --> 01:26:34.416
Whomever you choose.

01:26:35.375 --> 01:26:39.125
Ana Santos will manage
the auction for me.

01:26:39.208 --> 01:26:42.125
Wow! [laughs]

01:26:42.625 --> 01:26:45.125
I expect you to treat her
like you would treat me.

01:26:45.208 --> 01:26:49.458
If I hear otherwise, I'll move
my collection to Sotheby's.

01:26:49.541 --> 01:26:54.416
Are you kidding? We are...
thrilled to work with Ana.

01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:58.416
She's an amazing young woman
from our training program.

01:27:02.875 --> 01:27:06.375
-Do we have a problem?
-Nope. Absolutely not.

01:27:06.458 --> 01:27:08.000
Is there, Claire?

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:12.041
-Welcome back, Ana.
-Welcome back, Ana.

01:27:16.375 --> 01:27:19.000
-Love you.
-Love you. Thank you.

01:27:19.083 --> 01:27:22.291
And, uh,
thank you for trusting us.

01:27:22.375 --> 01:27:25.916
Ana, would you like to grab
Suzette's desk?

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.416
-What?
-We want Ana to be comfortable.

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.250
Drink? Water? Champagne?

01:27:30.333 --> 01:27:33.125
That won't be necessary,
Arnold, but thank you.

01:27:33.208 --> 01:27:34.583
Now before we start,

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:38.375
there is one person I can safely
say I'd like off the team.

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.916
Gerard.

01:27:45.791 --> 01:27:49.000
What? No, no, darling.
You can't do that.

01:27:49.083 --> 01:27:51.083
Yes, I can, darling.

01:27:51.166 --> 01:27:55.500
Claire was horrible to you.
Don't you want revenge?

01:27:55.583 --> 01:27:59.291
No. I don't want revenge.
I want Claire.

01:27:59.375 --> 01:28:03.416
She's done more for this company
than anybody else in this room

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.333
and grossed
twice as much as you.

01:28:10.375 --> 01:28:16.708
Well, Gerard, it appears
no one wants you. Let's go.

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:19.708
-Uh, excuse me. Claire stays?
-Claire stays, yeah.

01:28:21.125 --> 01:28:22.250
Come on.

01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:34.166
-What the fuck is going on?
-I told them the truth.

01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:35.791
Do tell.

01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:41.041
I told them you were the single
best person for the auction,

01:28:41.458 --> 01:28:45.333
and that you will ruin anybody
who crosses you or the company.

01:28:45.416 --> 01:28:48.125
You've had to fight
for your spot here...

01:28:49.083 --> 01:28:50.708
and so have I.

01:28:53.458 --> 01:28:55.208
Go on.

01:28:55.708 --> 01:28:58.208
I'd like to start
with the opening bids.

01:28:59.416 --> 01:29:03.875
I think we could be
undervaluing some pieces.

01:29:05.583 --> 01:29:06.666
What do you think?

01:29:13.125 --> 01:29:14.916
[laughs]

01:29:19.625 --> 01:29:21.916
Actually, I do agree.

01:29:23.875 --> 01:29:27.750
I knew there was a reason
I liked you. I'm never wrong.

01:29:30.708 --> 01:29:32.541
Shall we get to work?

01:29:36.791 --> 01:29:39.041
[indistinct chatter]

01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:45.833
[clears throat]
I just wanted to say,

01:29:45.916 --> 01:29:50.000
as a fellow woman of colour,
you are such an inspiration.

01:29:50.958 --> 01:29:54.208
Oh, my God, Renee. She just
has an olive complexion.

01:29:54.291 --> 01:29:56.416
What? She's from Guatemala.

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.500
[scoffs] You really need
to educate yourself.

01:29:58.583 --> 01:30:00.708
I'm from Florida.

01:30:00.791 --> 01:30:02.458
-[clicks fingers]
-Chairs. Chairs.

01:30:04.791 --> 01:30:08.291
Floridian, you got them working.
That's impressive.

01:30:09.666 --> 01:30:13.666
[gasps] You! The bizarre socks!

01:30:14.541 --> 01:30:15.833
Can I have a word?

01:30:19.041 --> 01:30:21.791
-[loud chatter]
-[gavel bangs]

01:30:23.875 --> 01:30:25.625
[laughs]

01:30:33.416 --> 01:30:35.791
[auctioneer] Final piece
for the Brovil collection.

01:30:35.875 --> 01:30:39.166
Starting at £75 million.
Looking for 85.

01:30:39.250 --> 01:30:41.500
At 90 million. Thank you, madam.
One hundred I'm bid.

01:30:41.583 --> 01:30:44.000
With the lady here
at 100 million.

01:30:44.083 --> 01:30:45.750
Any advance on 100?
All done at 100?

01:30:45.833 --> 01:30:48.291
I have 110
with the gentleman here

01:30:48.375 --> 01:30:51.041
at 110 million. 120, well done.

01:30:51.125 --> 01:30:54.458
Would you like to go 130?
We do. 130.

01:30:54.541 --> 01:30:57.958
We have 130 million on my right
with the gentleman.

01:30:58.041 --> 01:31:00.666
-Deep breath. 140!
-[crowd gasps]

01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:03.333
[auctioneer]
A record for the artist, 140.

01:31:03.416 --> 01:31:06.333
We're selling.
Not yours quite yet, sir. 140.

01:31:06.416 --> 01:31:09.125
No more for you, sir?
No more on the telephones.

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.333
With the lady. Are you sure?

01:31:12.791 --> 01:31:14.625
-[bangs gavel]
-Sold! Final sale.

01:31:14.708 --> 01:31:18.833
-[cheering]
-[auctioneer] £250 million.

01:31:18.916 --> 01:31:20.708
Biggest auction
in Erwins's history.

01:31:20.791 --> 01:31:22.125
[exhales]

01:31:23.375 --> 01:31:25.583
-When are you leaving?
-Tonight.

01:31:25.666 --> 01:31:28.250
I have some clients in New York
I'd like to see.

01:31:28.333 --> 01:31:31.041
-You don't stop, do you?
-Hmm.

01:31:31.125 --> 01:31:35.250
Exactly how Erwins's
future chairwoman should be.

01:31:36.208 --> 01:31:37.583
Thank you, Arnold.

01:31:37.666 --> 01:31:39.541
[Arnold] Let's talk about it.
Come on.

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:41.958
Long time coming.

01:31:43.375 --> 01:31:46.000
Oh. Be ready to leave
at seven o'clock tonight

01:31:46.083 --> 01:31:47.750
and you won't need
an upgrade either.

01:31:47.833 --> 01:31:50.583
You're going to be up front
where you belong.

01:31:52.375 --> 01:31:55.958
-Wasn't that exciting?
-Ana, congratulations.

01:31:56.041 --> 01:31:59.125
That wasn't
a low commission after all.

01:31:59.208 --> 01:32:02.416
No, it wasn't. Did Will make it?

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:04.416
-No, of course not.
-Right.

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:07.083
-Men and their football.
-Oh! That's right.

01:32:07.166 --> 01:32:08.916
I've got 20 quid on it.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.291
I just really wanted to
explain to him that...

01:32:11.375 --> 01:32:12.833
Wait, what?

01:32:12.916 --> 01:32:15.708
The Lions are in
the Championship game

01:32:15.791 --> 01:32:18.500
and seven-year-olds
can't coach themselves.

01:32:18.583 --> 01:32:20.166
[Julian laughs]

01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:23.250
You lied. I put up
with a lot of things in my life,

01:32:23.333 --> 01:32:26.333
but lying I don't have time for.
The world is hard enough

01:32:26.416 --> 01:32:28.958
without me having
to look over my shoulder.

01:32:29.041 --> 01:32:31.500
I suppose that means
nothing to you.

01:32:31.583 --> 01:32:34.291
And that breaks my heart.

01:32:35.791 --> 01:32:38.458
You made me believe
that you wanted to win,

01:32:38.541 --> 01:32:40.291
that you wanted to be champions.

01:32:40.375 --> 01:32:44.416
Their best player has asthma.
You lot are drawing to a team

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:47.541
whose best player needs
an inhaler to get on the pitch.

01:32:49.166 --> 01:32:50.666
[exhales]

01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:52.666
I wasn't gonna say this now,

01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:54.666
but since we are where we are,
I will, OK?

01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:58.250
After the game, I'm treating
you all to Pizza Express.

01:32:58.333 --> 01:32:59.250
[gasps]

01:32:59.333 --> 01:33:02.125
You've worked hard this season
and you deserve it.

01:33:02.208 --> 01:33:04.250
But if you win,

01:33:04.333 --> 01:33:07.250
I personally guarantee you all
unlimited ice cream.

01:33:07.333 --> 01:33:09.666
What if I want six scoops?

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.250
-Unlimited.
-[children gasp]

01:33:11.333 --> 01:33:13.000
OK?
Now, I want you to go out there

01:33:13.083 --> 01:33:15.083
and play your hearts out
for these final minutes.

01:33:15.166 --> 01:33:17.041
Not just for yourselves,
not even for me.

01:33:17.125 --> 01:33:18.750
Not for your mums and dads,

01:33:18.833 --> 01:33:20.583
whoever has come down
to watch you today,

01:33:20.666 --> 01:33:23.208
but for chocolate,
vanilla, pistachio,

01:33:23.291 --> 01:33:24.708
that weird flavour
that Zayn likes.

01:33:24.791 --> 01:33:26.625
-Gooseberry.
-Exactly.

01:33:27.125 --> 01:33:29.166
Now, hands in. Come on.

01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:30.291
Ready?

01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:33.333
-One, two, three!
-[all] Lions!

01:33:33.416 --> 01:33:35.166
-Come on!
-[child] Let's do this!

01:33:37.125 --> 01:33:38.541
[whistle blows]

01:33:43.166 --> 01:33:44.416
[whistle blows]

01:33:47.875 --> 01:33:50.375
I thought bribes
weren't allowed in sports.

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:52.833
[scoffs] Now is really
not a good time.

01:33:53.708 --> 01:33:55.541
Yeah. It's just that, uh...

01:33:55.625 --> 01:33:57.458
my plane leaves in,
like, three hours

01:33:57.541 --> 01:33:59.875
and I really can't leave
without talking to you.

01:33:59.958 --> 01:34:02.125
With all due respect,
we're in the final minutes here.

01:34:02.208 --> 01:34:05.083
-Got it.
-Defence, Tommy, defence!

01:34:05.166 --> 01:34:07.791
[children chatter and shout]

01:34:08.333 --> 01:34:10.375
I was hoping to talk to you
after the auction,

01:34:10.458 --> 01:34:13.458
-but then you never showed.
-Yeah. I heard it went well.

01:34:13.541 --> 01:34:15.708
I heard about my mum's
strategy with the deal.

01:34:15.791 --> 01:34:18.333
I heard about your big
confessional as well.

01:34:18.416 --> 01:34:21.875
Yeah. Turns out we were
both lying about something.

01:34:21.958 --> 01:34:24.458
Uh, acting.
My mum's a lot of things,

01:34:24.541 --> 01:34:26.125
but she's not a liar, OK?

01:34:26.208 --> 01:34:30.500
Right, well, neither am I.
Not most of the time, anyway.

01:34:30.583 --> 01:34:34.583
Look, Will, I'm really sorry
for lying to you,

01:34:34.666 --> 01:34:37.166
but I need you to know that even
though I lied about what I do,

01:34:37.583 --> 01:34:42.000
I wasn't lying about who I am
and how I feel.

01:34:42.083 --> 01:34:44.708
I couldn't make that up
even if I tried.

01:34:45.166 --> 01:34:48.875
I would love it
if we could start fresh

01:34:48.958 --> 01:34:50.791
with nothing but reality
this time.

01:34:50.875 --> 01:34:53.833
Look, I appreciate that, but
if we're talking about reality,

01:34:53.916 --> 01:34:56.375
you are literally about to fly
a thousand miles out of my life.

01:34:57.333 --> 01:34:59.041
What? What happened to
the job in New York?

01:34:59.125 --> 01:35:02.416
-I turned it down.
-You turned it down? Why?

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.375
Ryan, you're not moving!
Come on, wake up!

01:35:04.458 --> 01:35:07.041
Look, Ana. I am glad

01:35:07.125 --> 01:35:09.125
that it's all working out for
you now, that you won

01:35:09.208 --> 01:35:11.125
and that my mum's getting
her beach house in Spain.

01:35:11.208 --> 01:35:13.208
It's great that you're
being nice to me again

01:35:13.291 --> 01:35:15.041
now you've gotten everything
you wanted,

01:35:15.125 --> 01:35:16.250
but you were awful to me

01:35:16.333 --> 01:35:18.500
when it looked like things
weren't going to go your way.

01:35:18.875 --> 01:35:20.708
That is pretty hard to see
any differently.

01:35:20.791 --> 01:35:22.958
I was going to tell you
the truth eventually, I swear.

01:35:23.041 --> 01:35:25.500
I was trying to find a way to
do it without coming off insane,

01:35:25.583 --> 01:35:27.375
which feels impossible now.

01:35:27.458 --> 01:35:30.375
I was in over my head
and it snowballed.

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:32.916
But, honestly, Will,

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.125
I don't think you would've
kept talking to me

01:35:35.208 --> 01:35:36.583
if you knew the truth.

01:35:37.291 --> 01:35:39.708
The truth being that...

01:35:39.791 --> 01:35:42.750
I'm not like you. I don't
have any family connections,

01:35:42.833 --> 01:35:46.500
I have no savings, I've been
in credit card debt for years.

01:35:46.583 --> 01:35:48.250
I still live in a
one-bedroom apartment

01:35:48.333 --> 01:35:50.375
with my sister and her fiancé.

01:35:50.458 --> 01:35:54.875
I wake up every morning on their
futon as an unwelcome guest

01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:59.083
hoping that if I got the shot to
impress my boss even a little,

01:35:59.166 --> 01:36:01.791
I'd get the chance
to impress somebody like you.

01:36:03.333 --> 01:36:08.166
And then nobody would have
to know that I have nothing

01:36:08.250 --> 01:36:12.541
and I'm... I'm nobody.

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.875
Well, then I'm clearly not the
person who you thought I was,

01:36:15.958 --> 01:36:17.541
and whoever it was
you were trying to impress

01:36:17.625 --> 01:36:19.208
sounds like a right prick.

01:36:19.291 --> 01:36:21.458
-[football net rattles]
-[children cheer]

01:36:21.541 --> 01:36:25.083
-[whistle blows]
-[Will cheers] Oh, my God!

01:36:25.166 --> 01:36:28.375
Yes! Ryan, you little beauty!

01:36:28.458 --> 01:36:33.000
Yes! Yes! Yes! Brilliant stuff.
OK, hold on one second.

01:36:35.875 --> 01:36:41.041
Look, Ana. You are somebody.
Probably someone great too.

01:36:41.125 --> 01:36:42.500
I just never had a chance
to find out.

01:36:42.583 --> 01:36:43.541
Will...

01:36:43.625 --> 01:36:45.958
I wish I'd gotten the chance
to meet the real you,

01:36:46.041 --> 01:36:48.541
futon and all.

01:36:48.625 --> 01:36:50.708
Have a safe flight back, OK?

01:36:50.791 --> 01:36:53.125
-Right, come on. Let's go!
-[children cheer]

01:36:53.208 --> 01:36:54.833
I'm so proud of you lot.

01:36:55.791 --> 01:36:59.083
Yes. As promised,
ice cream and pizza.

01:37:04.708 --> 01:37:06.291
[chuckles quietly]

01:37:06.375 --> 01:37:08.666
[indistinct announcement]

01:37:14.666 --> 01:37:18.083
-[attendant] Champagne?
-Oh, thank you.

01:37:39.708 --> 01:37:42.333
[sirens and traffic sounds]

01:37:47.291 --> 01:37:49.791
-[dog pants]
-[background chatter]

01:37:52.416 --> 01:37:54.041
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:37:54.125 --> 01:37:57.000
You know, I think I get it now.

01:37:58.375 --> 01:37:59.583
Yeah?

01:37:59.666 --> 01:38:01.375
I would've been a millionaire
in kindergarten.

01:38:01.458 --> 01:38:02.708
-Ronnie!
-What?

01:38:02.791 --> 01:38:04.166
-It's nice.
-It's a square, Viv.

01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:06.125
There's free food and drink
over there.

01:38:06.208 --> 01:38:08.500
-How do you know it's free?
-It's my gallery.

01:38:09.458 --> 01:38:10.875
-Hmm.
-That is class, Ana.

01:38:11.333 --> 01:38:12.500
Class...

01:38:13.458 --> 01:38:14.416
Knock yourself out.

01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:16.500
[Ronnie] I told you she could
do it, didn't I, Viv?

01:38:16.583 --> 01:38:18.125
If I got that
kind of commission,

01:38:18.208 --> 01:38:19.791
I'm flying with Maverick.

01:38:23.250 --> 01:38:25.416
How does it feel
to run a gallery?

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:27.416
Feels pretty good, Amy.

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:29.083
-You've got money.
-Yeah.

01:38:29.166 --> 01:38:31.416
-You've got your health.
-Yup.

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.041
You could probably get on Raya.

01:38:33.125 --> 01:38:35.166
Claire's network goes
a long way.

01:38:36.208 --> 01:38:37.625
Look, she's here.

01:38:47.916 --> 01:38:50.041
Honestly,
I didn't think she'd make it.

01:38:50.125 --> 01:38:51.666
Too busy ruling the world.

01:38:54.583 --> 01:38:57.208
Well, I'm sorry you know who
didn't show up.

01:38:58.166 --> 01:39:00.166
No, it's fine.

01:39:00.250 --> 01:39:01.583
Pretty dumb of me
to get my hopes up.

01:39:01.666 --> 01:39:02.625
Let's go out tonight.

01:39:03.916 --> 01:39:06.833
I know that there are thousands
of people in this city

01:39:06.916 --> 01:39:09.750
who would love to fu...
talk to you.

01:39:10.166 --> 01:39:11.833
And he had his chance.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.125
Maybe another time.
I gotta stay and lock up.

01:39:22.333 --> 01:39:25.458
[woman] Congrats. It's really
wonderful. Fantastic job.

01:39:25.541 --> 01:39:28.291
-[Ana] Oh, thank you.
-[man] Thank you so much.

01:39:28.375 --> 01:39:30.708
[Ana] I really appreciate
you guys coming. Thank you.

01:39:30.791 --> 01:39:33.083
-[woman] Really great, Ana.
-[Ana] Thanks, guys.

01:39:52.208 --> 01:39:54.916
[suitcase clatters]

01:39:55.875 --> 01:39:58.000
Do you know how hard it was
to swipe those?

01:39:59.666 --> 01:40:02.541
Will. [laughs]

01:40:07.125 --> 01:40:08.000
[sighs]

01:40:13.666 --> 01:40:14.791
What are you doing here?

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:17.041
Did you accept the job
in New York?

01:40:17.125 --> 01:40:19.083
[Will] Yeah,
but that's not why I'm here.

01:40:19.166 --> 01:40:20.250
Why are you here?

01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:22.083
You still owe me for the suedes.

01:40:22.166 --> 01:40:23.333
[laughs]

01:40:24.291 --> 01:40:27.833
I will buy you new suedes
if you admit that you missed me.

01:40:28.791 --> 01:40:30.375
Ooh, that's a hard bargain.

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:33.750
Is this the part when you
walk away from a bad deal?

01:40:33.833 --> 01:40:35.708
I don't think
I can do that again.

01:40:44.250 --> 01:40:45.583
What do we do now?

01:40:48.291 --> 01:40:51.250
Let's start by dropping off
your bags at my place.

01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:58.875
Nice futon.

01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:08.291
