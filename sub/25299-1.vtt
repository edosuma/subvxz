on the same plane

01:10:27.835 --> 01:10:30.803
It was challenging to try
to figure out any way in which

01:10:30.805 --> 01:10:33.438
I could make
some kind of sense of it,

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.008
which I-I'm sure you two
can relate to.

was the remote,

when consciousness,
is absent?

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.374
Even with an eternity
of self-reflection,

01:31:18.376 --> 01:31:20.376
man cannot understand
the difference

01:31:20.378 --> 01:31:23.946
between actuality
and illusion.

01:31:23.948 --> 01:31:26.882
With every man born
comes a new reality...

01:31:26.884 --> 01:31:30.152
all competing in perpetuity.

01:31:30.154 --> 01:31:34.323
Perhaps this is why man
is so perpetually at odds.

01:31:34.325 --> 01:31:35.793
- So conflicted.
- [GROANING]

01:31:37.762 --> 01:31:41.263
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- So divided.

01:31:41.265 --> 01:31:42.898
Stop.

01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:44.936
[PANTING]

01:31:54.111 --> 01:31:57.446
Am I the only one
you're doing this to?

01:31:57.448 --> 01:31:59.850
Would you feel better
if you weren't?

01:32:01.152 --> 01:32:03.085
You don't want
to be alone.

01:32:03.087 --> 01:32:05.787
I don't wanna suffer.

01:32:05.789 --> 01:32:07.223
- You're in pain?
- Yes.

01:32:07.225 --> 01:32:10.326
Yes, I'm in pain,
and now I just have to sit here

01:32:10.328 --> 01:32:13.295
until I fucking die.

01:32:13.297 --> 01:32:15.763
What if you could return
to a moment

01:32:15.765 --> 01:32:18.100
in what you understand
as the past?

01:32:18.102 --> 01:32:20.202
Before you were sick?

01:32:20.204 --> 01:32:23.038
If I were to travel
back in time?

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:24.939
ALIEN:
Yes.

01:32:24.941 --> 01:32:27.478
With the information
you now possess.

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:32.214
How do you think
it would alter your behavior?

01:32:32.216 --> 01:32:34.383
What would you decide
to do differently,

01:32:34.385 --> 01:32:37.453
if anything at all?

01:32:37.455 --> 01:32:40.888
I would tell A.R.I.S.T.
to go fuck themselves.

01:32:40.890 --> 01:32:43.925
You would choose differently?

01:32:43.927 --> 01:32:46.160
ALEX:
I would stop this.

01:32:46.162 --> 01:32:47.895
I would stop you.

01:32:47.897 --> 01:32:51.734
- Remove us from the equation.
- I can't.

01:32:51.736 --> 01:32:53.469
ALIEN: You would be
unable to see us.

01:32:53.471 --> 01:32:55.169
Doesn't matter.

01:32:55.171 --> 01:32:58.139
I would know
that you're there.

01:32:58.141 --> 01:33:00.041
I would know that
you were watching.

01:33:00.043 --> 01:33:03.278
The idea alone would change
your perception of reality,

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:05.179
and therefore
change your behavior.

01:33:05.181 --> 01:33:07.115
Yes.

01:33:07.117 --> 01:33:09.752
ALIEN: Why would you behave
differently if there was

01:33:09.754 --> 01:33:12.820
nothing you could do
to alter the situation?

01:33:12.822 --> 01:33:15.925
- I just would.
- We find this curious.

01:33:18.061 --> 01:33:20.196
We don't choose.

01:33:22.098 --> 01:33:26.570
We don't decide what happens.
I didn't choose to be here.

01:33:29.072 --> 01:33:31.808
I didn't choose to get sick.

01:33:35.278 --> 01:33:38.212
Things happen
that we have no control of.

01:33:38.214 --> 01:33:41.849
We don't just... We don't just
look at the world...

01:33:41.851 --> 01:33:44.986
and paint it however we want.

01:33:44.988 --> 01:33:47.155
If you really believe that,

01:33:47.157 --> 01:33:49.190
then you believe
you are not in control,

01:33:49.192 --> 01:33:52.327
and you exist
at the mercy of all else.

01:33:52.329 --> 01:33:56.164
You believe your thoughts
are of no consequence.

01:33:56.166 --> 01:33:59.200
If you returned to a time
with knowledge you now possess,

01:33:59.202 --> 01:34:01.502
that you did not before...

01:34:01.504 --> 01:34:03.504
what would it matter?

01:34:03.506 --> 01:34:07.075
What would
our existence matter?

01:34:07.077 --> 01:34:10.246
What would
our observations matter?

01:34:11.214 --> 01:34:13.981
If time was reset...

01:34:13.983 --> 01:34:16.319
and you were put back...

01:34:17.387 --> 01:34:19.189
what difference
would it make?

So...

01:34:49.452 --> 01:34:51.421
that's everything.

01:34:54.123 --> 01:34:58.292
ALEX [ON COMPUTER]: <i>I don't know
if this is all a test, or...</i>

01:34:58.294 --> 01:35:02.332
I do know it can't change.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.402
But, you know, the world
could end tomorrow, but...

01:35:07.404 --> 01:35:12.174
[CHUCKLES] Fuck. You know, what...?
What else is new, right?

01:35:22.184 --> 01:35:24.654
It's all already happened.

01:35:26.922 --> 01:35:30.390
<i>Satellite's been found,
code's been cracked.</i>

01:35:30.392 --> 01:35:32.629
<i>Message decrypted.</i>

01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:38.934

<i>how it ends, but...</i>

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:35.255
Aah!

01:36:35.257 --> 01:36:38.160
...you can change
how you get there.

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:43.430
And another thing:

01:36:43.432 --> 01:36:45.565
<i>Warn her.</i>

01:36:45.567 --> 01:36:47.269
<i>Lie to her.</i>

01:36:48.737 --> 01:36:52.539
<i>Spare her from the truth,
so that she can...</i>

01:36:52.541 --> 01:36:55.009
<i>She can live in peace.</i>

01:36:59.414 --> 01:37:01.350
And then forget.

01:37:05.754 --> 01:37:07.521
Forget this message.

01:37:07.523 --> 01:37:09.589
Forget what's going to happen.

01:37:09.591 --> 01:37:13.527
Forget what's...
What's already happened.

01:37:13.529 --> 01:37:15.196
<i>Just...</i>

01:37:17.265 --> 01:37:19.535
