00:01.445 --> 00:02.960
When did you get this?

00:02.984 --> 00:04.929
Oh, six-month anniversary present.

00:04.953 --> 00:06.247
Gentlemen, what do you think?

00:06.279 --> 00:08.411
Amanda, here, is going to
overhaul the place for me.

00:08.435 --> 00:10.935
My ad agency wants to acquire
some of the footage you shot.

00:10.937 --> 00:12.160
Wolves running at Cherry Beach.

00:12.177 --> 00:14.277
I wish there was a way to
improve the quality though.

00:14.734 --> 00:16.166
Ah-h!

00:21.723 --> 00:23.122
Antonio!

00:23.124 --> 00:24.323
Ah-h!

00:25.693 --> 00:27.026
It's time for you to rest now.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.660
We should start our own pack.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.396
It doesn't work like that,
you're not one of us.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.932
Just one little bite and I
could be your werewolf queen.

00:32.934 --> 00:34.499
So where do we start?

00:34.501 --> 00:35.600
Cain.

00:43.501 --> 00:44.735
Don't kill him, we need him!

00:44.737 --> 00:46.803
I guarantee you will tell me

00:46.805 --> 00:48.872
where to find them before
I'm done with you.

00:50.174 --> 00:51.667
Jeremy!

00:51.690 --> 00:53.230
Hey.

00:55.846 --> 00:58.749
♪ When you tremble

00:59.850 --> 01:02.952

♪ Your lies are for me

01:40.624 --> 01:42.191
We should get the pyre built.

01:44.294 --> 01:47.229
I don't know if I can
do any more funerals.

01:47.231 --> 01:49.564
Nothing is going to happen
until Nick gets back

01:49.566 --> 01:51.866
and Jeremy gets better.

01:51.868 --> 01:55.169
I feel like we failed Antonio.

01:56.639 --> 01:58.506
We did.

02:14.823 --> 02:18.860
I thought I collapsed from blood loss.

02:18.862 --> 02:22.196
But a night's rest should've fixed that.

02:22.198 --> 02:24.398
There's something wrong, Elena.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.966
Very difficult to breathe.

02:28.604 --> 02:30.036
I don't understand.

02:30.038 --> 02:32.272
You're healing normally
but you're burning up.

02:32.274 --> 02:35.976
There has to be some sort of
poison in my bloodstream.

02:35.978 --> 02:38.779
They must've dipped
the knife in a toxin.

02:38.781 --> 02:40.813
What do I need to do
to find an antidote?

02:40.815 --> 02:44.150
We need to figure out
what the toxin is first.

02:44.152 --> 02:46.419
The wrong course of
treatment could be fatal.

02:49.390 --> 02:50.957
Jeremy's been poisoned.

02:50.959 --> 02:52.359
We have to find out what
they used on the knife.

02:52.361 --> 02:54.261
- How much time do we have?
- I don't know.

02:54.263 --> 02:56.829
Doesn't look good. It could be hours.

02:56.831 --> 02:59.164
- I'm going to find the Mutts.
- Give me a chance.

02:59.166 --> 03:01.534
Cain will know, I'll get it out of him.

03:01.536 --> 03:02.769
What if you can't?

03:02.771 --> 03:04.970
We'll figure something out.

03:04.972 --> 03:07.440
- Better go fast then.
- I'll make him talk.

03:17.218 --> 03:19.919
I don't think he wants to talk.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.476
Where are you going?

04:04.478 --> 04:06.345
I have to find the Mutts.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.114
And if you tell me that I can't go
by myself, I'll break your arm.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.916
You can't go out there by yourself.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.551
- We don't have time for this.
- Stay here,

04:12.553 --> 04:14.152
I'll work on Cain.

04:14.154 --> 04:16.822
You know what? Last time I
checked, wolves don't talk.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.790
I'm going to find out what
they poisoned Jeremy with.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.559
Your vengeance can come later.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.561
What's your plan?

04:22.563 --> 04:24.095
You're going to drive around and
hope they're out for a stroll?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.564
There was a woman with them.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.965
I'm going to find her.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.566
Any sign of the Mutts,
you're going to call me.

04:28.568 --> 04:30.768
I'll be there. We do this together.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.137
I'm not going to do
anything without backup.

04:33.139 --> 04:36.607
Any sign of trouble,
I'll call, all right?

04:36.609 --> 04:37.908
Okay.

04:48.521 --> 04:50.721
Nick.

04:50.723 --> 04:52.022
I sent everyone home.

04:52.024 --> 04:53.691
You won't be disturbed.

04:53.693 --> 04:54.959
Sorry about this.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.159
I needed a quiet spot.

04:56.161 --> 04:57.795
We can start back on the renos tomorrow.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.530
No problem.

04:59.532 --> 05:00.964
I only have one set of keys.

05:00.966 --> 05:02.632
Can you come back around 6:00?

05:02.634 --> 05:04.134
I'll be here.

05:04.136 --> 05:05.502
Sure.

05:05.504 --> 05:09.506
Please welcome
Brandy to the main stage.

05:09.508 --> 05:11.574
Nicky...

05:11.576 --> 05:13.576
- Hey.
- Jorge.

05:13.578 --> 05:15.812
You look great!

05:15.814 --> 05:17.213
Look at you, get in here!

05:17.215 --> 05:18.548
Ah!

05:18.550 --> 05:19.749
What are we doing

05:19.751 --> 05:21.217
meeting at a strip joint, huh?

05:21.219 --> 05:22.585
It's not a s...

05:22.587 --> 05:23.953
Never mind that.

05:23.955 --> 05:26.923
- Have a seat, okay?
- Yeah.

05:26.925 --> 05:28.992
You want a drink?

05:28.994 --> 05:30.560
It's not even noon yet.

05:30.562 --> 05:32.595
You haven't changed, huh?
Always a party with you.

05:32.597 --> 05:33.896
You got a bunch of girls back there?

05:33.898 --> 05:36.432
No girls, Jorge.

05:36.434 --> 05:39.068
I called you because I need
your help as a lawyer.

05:39.070 --> 05:40.936
Yeah! Whatever you need, Nicky.

05:43.606 --> 05:45.307
My father is dead.

05:49.446 --> 05:50.846
Nicky...

05:50.848 --> 05:52.548
don't joke around like that, man.

05:54.450 --> 05:55.551
I wish I were.

05:59.923 --> 06:03.358
I have to give you a little respect.

06:03.360 --> 06:07.062
I'm starting to think you're
not that stupid after all.

06:07.064 --> 06:09.597
You're thinking as long
as you stay a wolf,

06:09.599 --> 06:12.333
I won't be able to question you.

06:12.335 --> 06:15.103
Not a bad plan.

06:15.105 --> 06:18.139
You'd be right, except for one thing...

06:24.780 --> 06:26.280
I've done this before.

06:42.997 --> 06:44.831
Now this is looking pretty good.

06:44.833 --> 06:46.900
I was doing frame-grabs as I went.

06:46.902 --> 06:49.203
You want to hear something weird?

06:49.205 --> 06:51.705
I don't think this Nate guy was
being totally honest with us.

06:51.707 --> 06:56.710
- No? - He said he was out at
Cherry Beach just hanging.

06:56.712 --> 06:58.377
At night...

06:58.379 --> 07:00.714
I don't think he was out
there for the fresh air.

07:00.716 --> 07:02.515
Our little Nate's a perv.

07:02.517 --> 07:04.751
Look at this.

07:04.753 --> 07:06.052
See that?

07:11.191 --> 07:13.226
- It's clothes.
- Yeah.

07:13.228 --> 07:15.694
See how they're nicely stacked
and tucked out of the way?

07:15.696 --> 07:17.563
It looks like someone was
getting naked out there.

07:17.565 --> 07:20.366
I think Nate was busy
creeping on some lovers.

07:21.668 --> 07:23.569
What is it?

07:23.571 --> 07:24.770
Nothing, I...

07:24.772 --> 07:26.705
I just hope you're wrong.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.107
What difference does it make? You...

07:28.109 --> 07:30.142
You can still use it for
your campaign, right?

07:30.144 --> 07:32.277
That's the thing: if we use this

07:32.279 --> 07:35.413
and we find out later that he
was shooting people having sex,

07:35.415 --> 07:38.651
that is what's going to be
splashed all over the internet.

07:38.653 --> 07:40.653
It'll be a PR disaster.

07:40.655 --> 07:43.255
Peeping Tom Vodka.

07:43.257 --> 07:44.923
I am going to have
to go and talk to Nate

07:44.925 --> 07:47.925
and see if he has any additional
footage that he hasn't shown us.

07:47.927 --> 07:50.028
I told you we make a great team.

07:52.798 --> 07:54.098
We did.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.806
It's all on there.

08:01.808 --> 08:04.275
I even threw in an app I
wrote to tweak the settings:

08:04.277 --> 08:05.743
gamma, contrast, stuff like that.

08:05.745 --> 08:07.178
Sylvie... I believe you

08:07.180 --> 08:09.147
with all this "I love
my girlfriend" stuff.

08:09.149 --> 08:10.782
You're a good guy, Philip.

08:10.784 --> 08:12.383
But think for a second.

08:12.385 --> 08:14.886
You know six of my friends who
could've done this for you,

08:14.888 --> 08:16.788
but you called me.

08:16.790 --> 08:19.356
Why put yourself in that
position unless somewhere,

08:19.358 --> 08:21.225
deep down, you wanted me to be here?

08:21.227 --> 08:22.959
I was hoping that we could be mature.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.461
Really?

08:24.463 --> 08:25.696
I'm looking around.

08:25.698 --> 08:28.131
Where is she?

08:28.133 --> 08:29.567
Yeah, that's what I thought.

09:26.289 --> 09:27.389
Gotcha!

09:36.699 --> 09:40.201
Santos, Marsten, Cain.
They've organized.

09:40.203 --> 09:42.971
They took out the Stillwells
and they killed Pete.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.906
I should talk to Jeremy.

09:44.908 --> 09:46.274
I love you, cuz.

09:46.276 --> 09:48.442
But you're not inner circle.

09:48.444 --> 09:50.178
Jeremy asked me to talk to you,

09:50.180 --> 09:52.446
and that's how it's going to be.

09:52.448 --> 09:54.482
All right, no problem. I
didn't mean anything by it.

09:54.484 --> 09:57.018
They caught us off-guard,
but nothing has changed.

09:57.020 --> 09:58.586
We are still the Pack.

09:58.588 --> 10:00.721
These assholes think they
can come at Stonehaven,

10:00.723 --> 10:03.891
but we're going to teach them
a lesson once and for all.

10:03.893 --> 10:05.293
What do you need from me?

10:05.295 --> 10:06.794
There is the matter of my father's life

10:06.796 --> 10:08.529
in the human world.

10:08.531 --> 10:11.399
We need to erase it before
anyone starts asking questions.

10:11.401 --> 10:14.134
Everyone else can think
that Jeremy let him retire.

10:14.136 --> 10:16.236
I need to trust your discretion.

10:20.776 --> 10:22.075
I'll take that drink.

10:25.113 --> 10:26.847
Don't worry, Jorge.

10:26.849 --> 10:28.048
Everything's under control.

10:28.050 --> 10:29.817
- All right.
- Okay, Nicky.

10:31.118 --> 10:32.419
One more thing.

10:36.490 --> 10:38.458
No more "Nicky".

10:38.460 --> 10:40.427
Okay?

10:40.429 --> 10:41.861
Yeah.

10:41.863 --> 10:43.162
All right.

11:16.963 --> 11:18.163
I wouldn't do that.

11:18.165 --> 11:20.832
That only gets tighter when you pull.

11:20.834 --> 11:23.101
What do you want?

11:23.103 --> 11:25.370
Just to talk.

11:25.372 --> 11:28.173
I ain't got nothing to say.

11:28.175 --> 11:30.308
Well, that's up to you.

11:30.310 --> 11:31.910
But you see the way the rope's looped.

11:31.912 --> 11:34.946
A wolf's shoulder can't
rotate in that direction.

11:34.948 --> 11:39.817
So if you try to change, your arms
will rip out of their sockets.

11:39.819 --> 11:41.552
That's also up to you.

12:21.666 --> 12:22.966
Shit...

12:29.039 --> 12:30.574
Hey!

12:30.576 --> 12:32.475
Hey, I was just thinking about you.

12:32.477 --> 12:34.610
Thought I'd check in.

12:34.612 --> 12:36.512
Everything's fine.

12:36.514 --> 12:38.114
<i>Have you been running?</i>

12:38.116 --> 12:40.349
I just noticed you left all
of your running gear here,

12:40.351 --> 12:42.752
<i>and I know how much you like to run.</i>

12:42.754 --> 12:44.120
Um...

12:44.122 --> 12:45.755
I'm not really thinking about that.

12:45.757 --> 12:47.590
<i>No, no, I get that.</i>

12:47.592 --> 12:48.824
<i>But you and Logan</i>

12:48.826 --> 12:50.626
run together.

12:50.628 --> 12:53.429
You have that spot somewhere
down in Cherry Beach, right?

12:55.599 --> 12:57.333
Look, I know this is difficult, 'kay,

12:57.335 --> 13:00.569
me being away and
dealing with family but...

13:00.571 --> 13:02.004
it'll be done soon.

13:02.006 --> 13:05.473
That necklace I gave you
for our anniversary...

13:05.475 --> 13:07.442
<i>Are you wearing it now?</i>

13:09.312 --> 13:12.214
You're acting strange. What's going on?

13:12.216 --> 13:13.949
Nothing.

13:13.951 --> 13:17.219
I just want things to be normal.

13:17.221 --> 13:19.087
Come back soon.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.422
<i>Love you.</i>

13:20.424 --> 13:21.523
Me too.

13:33.703 --> 13:35.937
What was used to poison the blade?

13:35.939 --> 13:37.372
What are you talking about?

13:37.374 --> 13:39.473
I don't know anything about any poison.

13:42.010 --> 13:43.010
Oh...

13:43.012 --> 13:46.080
LeBlanc poisoned his blade?

13:46.082 --> 13:49.050
Holy shit!

13:49.052 --> 13:51.652
Looks like Santos bit
a winner after all.

13:51.654 --> 13:52.854
Just tell me where they are

13:52.856 --> 13:54.155
so I can find out what he used.

13:54.157 --> 13:56.289
Shove it up your ass, bro.

13:58.026 --> 14:00.327
Take a look around. Huh?

14:00.329 --> 14:02.596
This place wasn't built
for quiet reflection.

14:02.598 --> 14:05.766
So why don't you start talking
while I'm still feeling friendly.

14:05.768 --> 14:07.468
Oh...

14:07.470 --> 14:10.937
Okay, Mr. Friendly.

14:10.939 --> 14:13.373
You know that shitheel, Pete?

14:13.375 --> 14:14.741
I held him down.

14:14.743 --> 14:17.443
Sat on his chest.

14:17.445 --> 14:19.412
He was like a helpless,

14:19.414 --> 14:22.249
snot-nosed little kid in a schoolyard.

14:22.251 --> 14:26.052
Squealing and crying like a little girl.

14:26.054 --> 14:27.820
"Oh, please don't hurt me."

14:27.822 --> 14:30.322
"Please! Plea-ase!

14:30.324 --> 14:33.158
It hurts!"

14:33.160 --> 14:35.762
And I was staring right in his face

14:35.764 --> 14:40.733
when LeBlanc took that knife
and ran it across his throat.

14:40.735 --> 14:43.235
And this was the last thing he saw.

14:46.940 --> 14:48.908
I'm not afraid of you.

14:48.910 --> 14:50.776
So bring it.

14:50.778 --> 14:52.544
Come on, bring it, you son of a bitch!

14:52.546 --> 14:54.479
That's it! Bring it!

14:54.481 --> 14:55.881
Come on, you know you want to finish it.

14:55.883 --> 14:57.283
So do it!

14:57.285 --> 15:00.019
Do it. <i>Do it.</i>

15:00.021 --> 15:02.521
- Huh?
- You're not getting off that easy.

15:08.628 --> 15:10.261
Coward!

15:31.584 --> 15:33.017
What have you got?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.452
Well, the mystery girl's with Cain.

15:35.555 --> 15:38.188
<i>I just found their love nest,</i>
<i>an RV off the 275.</i>

15:38.190 --> 15:41.224
- Any trouble?
<i>- No, all their stuff's still here.</i>

15:41.226 --> 15:44.127
I think I'll just sit on it
and hope that she comes back.

15:44.129 --> 15:46.029
Maybe she'll lead us to
where the Mutts are hiding.

15:46.031 --> 15:47.898
Okay. You remember the deal?

15:47.900 --> 15:49.399
I'll call.

15:49.401 --> 15:51.435
I'm not interested
in taking them on by myself.

15:56.408 --> 15:58.875
Who's the girl?

15:58.877 --> 16:00.877
I got an idea.

16:00.879 --> 16:04.414
How about you untie me and we
finish this the old-fashioned way?

16:04.416 --> 16:06.016
We found your RV.

16:06.018 --> 16:08.317
Won't be long before we find her.

16:08.319 --> 16:12.622
- Who is she?
- Some skank I picked up in Jonestown.

16:12.624 --> 16:13.890
I took her off a biker.

16:13.892 --> 16:15.592
She stabbed Jeremy.

16:15.594 --> 16:17.660
Good.

16:17.662 --> 16:19.829
I guess she'll do anything
for a bag of coke

16:19.831 --> 16:21.764
and a couple of rocks of crystal, huh?

16:21.766 --> 16:24.633
She don't know shit from shingles.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.668
Then where is she?

16:26.670 --> 16:28.570
How do I know? I'm in here.

16:28.572 --> 16:30.473
She's probably tweaked out of her mind

16:30.475 --> 16:33.509
and blowing some trucker on the way
back to Bumblast, Pennsylvania.

16:33.511 --> 16:34.610
What do I care?

17:37.939 --> 17:40.374
All right, I closed out
Antonio's accounts,

17:40.376 --> 17:43.477
moved them offshore: you'll
be the only one with access.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.279
Good.

17:45.281 --> 17:47.480
Now they're expecting him
in New York next week.

17:47.482 --> 17:50.984
He's probably got a bunch of
board meetings and a schedule.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.286
Book him on a flight to Frankfurt.

17:53.288 --> 17:56.590
Six-hour layover, and then Rome.

17:56.592 --> 17:59.092
We're going to need a cover story.

17:59.094 --> 18:01.494
That bunch on Wall Street, they...

18:01.496 --> 18:03.629
gossip more than a quilting bee.

18:03.631 --> 18:07.200
Anyone looking for him will
think he had a midlife crisis.

18:07.202 --> 18:09.168
I'll start dropping hints.

18:09.170 --> 18:11.204
He wanted out, he'd had enough.

18:11.206 --> 18:15.040
He wanted to grow grapes and make wine.

18:15.042 --> 18:16.775
Let the rumour mill
take care of the rest.

18:16.777 --> 18:18.711
Before you know it, there'll
be 20 different stories

18:18.713 --> 18:20.479
about why he disappeared.

18:20.481 --> 18:21.847
That should do it.

18:21.849 --> 18:23.148
I learned from the best.

18:24.918 --> 18:28.721
Nobody could make a dead wolf
disappear quite like my dad.

18:28.723 --> 18:32.057
Here's to Antonio.

18:32.059 --> 18:35.127
After today, he takes
his place in the Legacy.

18:35.129 --> 18:36.428
Long may it last.

18:45.272 --> 18:47.705
Your blood pressure is dangerously low.

18:47.707 --> 18:48.973
Where is Elena?

18:48.975 --> 18:50.542
Tracking the woman who stabbed you.

18:50.544 --> 18:53.511
No. You need to tell her about
the first day in Stonehaven.

18:53.513 --> 18:55.446
This isn't your deathbed.

18:55.448 --> 18:57.481
Not yet.

18:57.483 --> 18:59.583
What about Cain?

18:59.585 --> 19:02.053
Doesn't seem to know about the poison.

19:02.055 --> 19:04.455
Do what you have to do: hurt him.

19:04.457 --> 19:06.357
I don't think that'll work.

19:06.359 --> 19:07.859
He wants me to finish him off.

19:07.861 --> 19:11.928
The closer he gets,
the longer he'll hold out.

19:11.930 --> 19:14.331
He was always a strong one.

19:14.333 --> 19:17.834
Yeah, he's loyal even for a Mutt.

19:17.836 --> 19:22.206
Would've made a good Pack member
if he wasn't such an asshole.

19:22.208 --> 19:28.945
My first Change was at Rushford Lake.

19:28.947 --> 19:30.981
My father tied a rock around my neck

19:30.983 --> 19:32.783
and threw me in the water.

19:32.785 --> 19:34.517
We don't need to talk about Malcolm now.

19:34.519 --> 19:36.319
You're nothing like he was.

19:36.321 --> 19:39.756
He wanted me to experience the
feeling of death as a boy...

19:41.125 --> 19:42.425
and as a wolf.

19:45.095 --> 19:48.831
He wanted me to feel it.

19:48.833 --> 19:50.567
I...

19:50.569 --> 19:54.470
I can still feel the black... waters.

19:57.308 --> 20:00.375
I would do anything
to trade places with you.

20:01.978 --> 20:05.681
My father is the poison in my blood.

20:12.757 --> 20:15.190
It's my blood...

20:15.192 --> 20:17.459
that's the poison.

20:18.761 --> 20:19.861
My father's the poison...

20:34.111 --> 20:35.443
Must be tough to get your share

20:35.445 --> 20:37.212
when you live with someone like Cain.

20:42.251 --> 20:43.451
Let's talk.

20:51.446 --> 20:53.446
Tell me Cain is still alive.

20:53.448 --> 20:56.116
He's alive.

20:56.118 --> 20:58.085
For now.

20:58.087 --> 21:00.087
Is he hurt?

21:00.089 --> 21:03.657
I don't know, I've been
busy looking for you.

21:03.659 --> 21:05.458
How did you find me?

21:05.460 --> 21:07.527
You forgot about Cain's truck.

21:10.030 --> 21:12.031
I assume you know who I am.

21:12.033 --> 21:15.201
Elena, right?

21:15.203 --> 21:16.903
I'm Amber.

21:16.905 --> 21:19.205
You stabbed my friend, Amber.

21:19.207 --> 21:22.675
You mean your Alpha?

21:22.677 --> 21:24.510
What did Cain tell you?

21:24.512 --> 21:26.879
You mean about the whole werewolf thing?

21:29.717 --> 21:31.483
Lower your voice.

21:31.485 --> 21:35.021
Maybe I'll shout it from the rooftops.

21:35.023 --> 21:37.023
Where is my man?

21:37.025 --> 21:38.324
He's alive.

21:40.493 --> 21:44.296
And whether or not he stays that way

21:44.298 --> 21:45.597
depends on you.

21:50.970 --> 21:52.771
I can't feel my arms.

21:52.773 --> 21:57.775
Rub under your armpits. It'll
get the circulation going.

21:57.777 --> 21:59.744
You hungry?

21:59.746 --> 22:00.846
I'm starving.

22:19.064 --> 22:21.332
Zachary Cain.

22:21.334 --> 22:26.003
Theo Cain, werewolf
from Holcomb, Kansas.

22:26.005 --> 22:27.838
Where do I know that from?

22:27.840 --> 22:30.875
I don't know. It's my
old man's hometown.

22:30.877 --> 22:33.010
"In Cold Blood".

22:33.012 --> 22:35.445
Truman Capote wrote a book
about a pair of drifters

22:35.447 --> 22:38.448
who went to Holcomb
and murdered a family.

22:38.450 --> 22:40.751
Happens all the time, why write a book?

22:40.753 --> 22:43.387
I think you must know the drifter life.

22:43.389 --> 22:46.122
Your father was never Pack.

22:46.124 --> 22:48.425
Alone, cut off.

22:48.427 --> 22:50.527
Never staying anywhere
long enough to feel at home.

22:50.529 --> 22:54.230
What would you know about it?

22:54.232 --> 22:57.467
I was bit when I was seven.

22:57.469 --> 22:59.335
Campsite outside of Baton Rouge.

23:02.106 --> 23:06.009
I ended up feral and alone.

23:06.011 --> 23:07.510
My family couldn't find me

23:07.512 --> 23:09.245
and eventually, they gave up.

23:12.516 --> 23:16.286
I know what it feels like to be alone.

23:16.288 --> 23:18.487
In the swamps.

23:18.489 --> 23:20.856
Nothing but a crazy hunger and a need.

23:23.627 --> 23:25.661
Yeah.

23:25.663 --> 23:28.363
We all got a little bit of that.

23:31.768 --> 23:35.404
My old man taught me how to stay alive.

23:35.406 --> 23:38.740
It was Jeremy who found me.

23:38.742 --> 23:41.310
Gave me a home.

23:41.312 --> 23:43.378
A place... this place.

23:46.416 --> 23:49.884
Well, isn't that good for you.

23:49.886 --> 23:52.420
Could be for you too.

23:52.422 --> 23:54.556
We don't have to fight each other.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.891
You don't have to be going from
one shitty town to another

23:56.893 --> 23:58.192
in a string of stolen cars.

23:58.194 --> 24:01.362
You can have a place of your own.

24:01.364 --> 24:04.031
- Join the Pack.
- Why not?

24:04.033 --> 24:06.000
What about Pete?

24:06.002 --> 24:07.501
All that's forgiven?

24:07.503 --> 24:09.837
Or do I wake up one day with
a noose around my neck?

24:09.839 --> 24:12.940
Pete always put the Pack
ahead of vengeance.

24:12.942 --> 24:14.641
So will I.

24:14.643 --> 24:16.444
Just tell me where to find them.

24:18.113 --> 24:20.881
Cain signed your death warrant.

24:20.883 --> 24:22.083
It's a basic rule.

24:22.085 --> 24:23.450
You can't know about us.

24:23.452 --> 24:25.051
That's your rule, not Cain's.

24:25.053 --> 24:28.555
It's the only reason
we've survived this long.

24:28.557 --> 24:30.423
The Pack can't let you live.

24:30.425 --> 24:33.193
You will be trapped and killed by
the best hunters in the world.

24:33.195 --> 24:35.729
So why don't you kill me?

24:35.731 --> 24:37.965
I'm not the only one you
should be worried about.

24:41.668 --> 24:44.804
Cain told me the rule when I found out.

24:47.274 --> 24:49.909
He couldn't do it though.

24:49.911 --> 24:54.714
He'd rather risk punishment
than kill me.

24:54.716 --> 24:57.717
I thought, "A real live werewolf."

24:59.152 --> 25:00.820
"And he loves me."

25:03.223 --> 25:06.826
And then I found out about you.

25:06.828 --> 25:10.129
The one woman who survived being bitten.

25:10.131 --> 25:13.098
You're living the life I want.

25:13.100 --> 25:15.800
I could be with Cain
and no one would hunt me.

25:17.937 --> 25:19.538
You asked him to bite you.

25:19.540 --> 25:22.307
He won't do it.

25:22.309 --> 25:25.344
He's afraid of losing me.

25:25.346 --> 25:28.080
Says it would break his heart.

25:28.082 --> 25:29.414
He's got this thing...

25:29.416 --> 25:31.182
in his big thick head

25:31.184 --> 25:32.884
that you're special somehow.

25:35.655 --> 25:38.389
But I could survive it.

25:38.391 --> 25:41.125
You know I could.

25:41.127 --> 25:44.829
I could be just like you.

25:44.831 --> 25:47.631
Trust me.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.934
You don't want this.

25:49.936 --> 25:54.505
Want to know something else
my old man showed me, hmm?

25:54.507 --> 25:56.541
How to live free.

25:56.543 --> 25:58.709
See, I was born a wolf, baby.

25:58.711 --> 26:02.212
I come from a long line going
back hundreds of years,

26:02.214 --> 26:06.483
and I don't owe anybody anything.

26:06.485 --> 26:07.785
You get bitten in.

26:07.787 --> 26:09.252
You think you know the score.

26:11.356 --> 26:13.490
Boo-hoo, you lived in a swamp!

26:15.426 --> 26:16.961
You see...

26:16.963 --> 26:19.929
that's the trouble with the Pack.

26:19.931 --> 26:22.199
They'll let any
Johnny-come-lately Louisiana turd

26:22.201 --> 26:23.933
stink up the clubhouse.

26:23.935 --> 26:25.935
Your father died with a bottle
of corn liquor in his hand

26:25.937 --> 26:27.571
and a baseball bat to
the back of the head.

26:27.573 --> 26:29.005
Is that how you want to go?

26:29.007 --> 26:32.542
Antonio Sorrentino spilled
his guts on a dirt road.

26:32.544 --> 26:34.211
We all got to go somehow.

26:54.331 --> 26:55.831
Mr. Danvers!

26:55.833 --> 26:57.500
I'm so glad you're home.

26:57.502 --> 26:58.767
Jeremy isn't here.

26:58.769 --> 27:00.202
Oh, it's you I wanted to talk to.

27:00.204 --> 27:01.504
I came by the other day.

27:01.506 --> 27:02.938
You were supposed to call me?

27:02.940 --> 27:04.607
What's it about?

27:04.609 --> 27:07.009
Well, we're investigating the
murder of Michael Braxton.

27:07.011 --> 27:08.043
It's a terrible thing.

27:08.045 --> 27:10.078
I was hoping to clear up a few things.

27:10.080 --> 27:11.279
Scratch you off my list.

27:11.281 --> 27:12.480
Wow, I'm on a list!

27:12.482 --> 27:13.949
It's the way these things work.

27:13.951 --> 27:16.484
Everyone's on the list
until we narrow it down.

27:16.486 --> 27:18.553
Just a couple questions.
Shouldn't take too long.

27:18.555 --> 27:19.955
It's um...

27:19.957 --> 27:23.458
not really something I can
do standing on your stoop.

27:23.460 --> 27:24.925
Right. Well, um...

27:24.927 --> 27:26.727
I was just about to
head into town, so...

27:26.729 --> 27:28.062
I'll stop by the station.

27:28.064 --> 27:30.064
Great! Shouldn't take
too much of your time.

27:30.066 --> 27:31.166
I'll grab my jacket.

27:34.736 --> 27:37.272
I need to know about the poison.

27:37.274 --> 27:38.839
Poison? What are you talking about?

27:38.841 --> 27:40.308
You coated your knife with something.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.376
I need to know what it is.

27:42.378 --> 27:44.211
That must've been LeBlanc.

27:44.213 --> 27:45.713
I try to stay away from him.

27:45.715 --> 27:47.481
The guy skeeves me out.

27:47.483 --> 27:49.283
He should.

27:49.285 --> 27:51.752
He's a serial killer, Amber.

27:51.754 --> 27:54.521
Bring Cain back to me,

27:54.523 --> 27:58.659
and I'll tell you where to find LeBlanc.

27:58.661 --> 28:01.261
Let's go. You show me where they are,

28:01.263 --> 28:04.064
and I will do what I can to get
Cain back to you, I promise.

28:04.066 --> 28:06.533
How do I know you're not going
to kill him and me anyway?

28:06.535 --> 28:08.435
All I can do is talk to Jeremy,

28:08.437 --> 28:10.637
but it is your only hope.

28:10.639 --> 28:13.006
They told me you would
say something like that.

28:16.711 --> 28:19.012
They were right about a lot of things.

28:21.382 --> 28:22.582
Here they are.

28:31.350 --> 28:33.217
Oh, run along, dearie.

28:33.219 --> 28:34.519
We'll take it from here.

28:44.229 --> 28:47.531
Hello, Elena.

28:47.533 --> 28:50.834
Biting in psychos was one thing.

28:50.836 --> 28:53.137
But I never thought you'd
be this reckless, Karl.

28:53.139 --> 28:56.874
How could you let a human know about us?

28:56.876 --> 28:58.475
Are you out of your mind?

28:58.477 --> 29:00.143
It wasn't my call.

29:00.145 --> 29:02.145
I'm merely a passenger on this ride.

29:02.147 --> 29:04.281
Still looking out for yourself, I see.

29:04.283 --> 29:06.517
I believe they call it
"looking out for number one,"

29:06.519 --> 29:08.786
and yes, indeed. I am.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.854
Something you should be
thinking about doing too.

29:10.856 --> 29:13.424
All I'm thinking about
is snapping your neck.

29:13.426 --> 29:15.858
Hmm...

29:15.860 --> 29:17.660
I like that.

29:17.662 --> 29:21.531
The ones that try to fight
back are the most fun.

29:21.533 --> 29:23.266
Hmm...

29:23.268 --> 29:26.002
Well, then you're going
to have a blast with me.

29:27.604 --> 29:29.339
I believe Daniel Santos

29:29.341 --> 29:31.241
made you an offer?

29:31.243 --> 29:33.142
It still stands.

29:33.144 --> 29:36.712
You don't want to end up
on your own out there.

29:36.714 --> 29:38.314
Believe me, it's no picnic.

29:38.316 --> 29:39.982
I don't get it, Karl.

29:39.984 --> 29:42.318
What did the Pack ever do against you?

29:42.320 --> 29:44.921
Hasn't done much for me either.

29:44.923 --> 29:47.056
How many times must I ask for territory?

29:50.760 --> 29:52.861
I could kill you right now.

29:52.863 --> 29:55.730
A slice down your femoral
artery would be so easy.

29:55.732 --> 29:57.632
You'd bleed out in 30 seconds.

29:59.136 --> 30:00.836
You could try.

30:00.838 --> 30:03.973
These are rash, these ones.

30:03.975 --> 30:06.374
But Mr. LeBlanc knows better,

30:06.376 --> 30:08.209
don't you?

30:10.547 --> 30:12.313
What are you doing?

30:12.315 --> 30:14.315
You make a public scene,

30:14.317 --> 30:17.418
and it won't take long
until the cops grab you

30:17.420 --> 30:19.420
and bring you back to wherever it is

30:19.422 --> 30:21.722
that you came from.

30:21.724 --> 30:26.227
I'm an expert at keeping a low profile.

30:26.229 --> 30:28.463
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

30:30.200 --> 30:33.101
Remember...

30:33.103 --> 30:34.535
low profile.

30:34.537 --> 30:36.904
You bitch!

30:36.906 --> 30:38.205
Tell me about the poison.

30:42.745 --> 30:44.745
It won't do you any good.

30:44.747 --> 30:46.881
It's already too late.

30:49.385 --> 30:51.351
Ricin. Damn it!

30:51.353 --> 30:53.754
Ricin!

30:53.756 --> 30:56.356
You're going to stand up.

30:56.358 --> 30:59.292
And you're going to let
me out of this booth.

30:59.294 --> 31:00.593
Do as the lady says.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.173
Clay?

31:21.382 --> 31:22.882
Okay.

31:22.884 --> 31:25.018
You've been poisoned with ricin.

31:25.020 --> 31:26.019
With ricin?

31:26.021 --> 31:29.455
Tell me what you need me to do.

31:29.457 --> 31:30.656
I need a blood transfusion.

32:12.699 --> 32:16.468
We never checked for compatibility.

32:16.470 --> 32:17.668
We're the same.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.216
What are we drinking to?

32:32.218 --> 32:34.017
Nothing.

32:34.019 --> 32:36.520
We're just drinking.

32:36.522 --> 32:39.223
'96 Toscana.

32:39.225 --> 32:41.858
- Nice.
- Hmm.

32:41.860 --> 32:44.928
I was there when these
grapes were grown.

32:44.930 --> 32:49.266
Little villa outside of Peralta.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.701
Just my father and me.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.369
A vacation?

32:53.371 --> 32:55.105
Life lessons.

32:57.808 --> 33:00.510
We roamed the hills
and olive orchards...

33:02.046 --> 33:05.048
lemon trees, jasmine...

33:07.251 --> 33:09.818
He taught me how to track wild
boar through chestnut groves

33:09.820 --> 33:11.521
using just smell.

33:11.523 --> 33:15.658
I've never heard you talk
about your father before.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.393
He taught me everything I know.

33:19.197 --> 33:20.296
Like what?

33:23.700 --> 33:26.434
The chase is about feeling
what your prey is feeling.

33:28.337 --> 33:30.739
Is that right?

33:30.741 --> 33:33.776
It's timing when you make your move.

33:33.778 --> 33:37.479
Not when you're ready,
but when they are.

33:37.481 --> 33:41.216
That beat of anticipation.

33:41.218 --> 33:44.719
When you know it's coming.

33:44.721 --> 33:46.788
When every nerve ending is crackling.

33:46.790 --> 33:49.291
Ready for it.

33:51.260 --> 33:54.829
It's the moment when
they are most alive.

33:54.831 --> 33:58.199
Are you trying to seduce me, Nick?

33:58.201 --> 34:00.467
Nope.

34:01.671 --> 34:02.970
That part's already done.

34:05.007 --> 34:08.275
♪ Close your eyes

34:11.213 --> 34:15.315
♪ And wait for better days

34:17.518 --> 34:20.920
♪ It's no surprise ♪

34:23.958 --> 34:27.527
♪ That it ended this way

34:30.130 --> 34:33.533
♪ Put your mouth on my mouth

34:34.936 --> 34:40.005
♪ And breathe

34:42.909 --> 34:45.911
♪ Put your mouth on my mouth

34:47.514 --> 34:52.619
♪ And breathe

35:19.879 --> 35:23.448
♪ I heard you're hunting for nothing ♪

35:26.319 --> 35:30.054
♪ I heard you caught a disease

35:32.458 --> 35:36.060
♪ I heard that you been fishin' ♪

35:39.265 --> 35:42.066
♪ On some temperate seas

35:54.179 --> 35:55.579
You're looking to rent?

35:55.581 --> 35:56.947
Oh, God...

35:56.949 --> 35:58.849
No, I'm, uh, just looking for the guy

35:58.851 --> 36:00.050
that used to live here.

36:00.052 --> 36:01.251
I think you mean woman.

36:01.253 --> 36:02.986
No-no, it was a young guy. Um...

36:02.988 --> 36:04.988
- Nate.
- Only person that lived here

36:04.990 --> 36:06.990
was an old hag named Liz.

36:06.992 --> 36:08.859
Maybe it was her grandson or something?

36:08.861 --> 36:10.093
And there was...

36:10.095 --> 36:11.895
there was computers and stuff.

36:11.897 --> 36:14.264
She didn't know a computer
from a toaster.

36:14.266 --> 36:16.566
She died here about a month ago.

36:16.568 --> 36:17.868
She was a bit of a shut-in.

36:17.870 --> 36:19.937
No friends, no family,
and definitely no Nate.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.739
What are you talking about?

36:22.741 --> 36:24.107
I was here yesterday.

36:24.109 --> 36:25.542
There was equipment everywhere.

36:25.544 --> 36:27.444
Buddy, what do you want me to tell you?

36:27.446 --> 36:30.279
You either got the wrong building,
or you're remembering wrong.

36:30.281 --> 36:31.381
Come on.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.321
How's Jeremy?

36:40.691 --> 36:41.991
It was ricin.

36:43.660 --> 36:46.062
Gave him some of my
blood, he should be okay.

36:48.965 --> 36:51.867
Where were you?

36:51.869 --> 36:53.434
The sheriff came by.

36:53.436 --> 36:55.770
She wanted to ask
questions about Braxton.

36:55.772 --> 36:58.173
I had to get her out of here.

36:58.175 --> 36:59.374
They think you did it.

36:59.376 --> 37:00.775
They don't have anything.

37:00.777 --> 37:02.978
They're fishing.

37:02.980 --> 37:04.278
How did you know it was ricin?

37:08.250 --> 37:10.951
I had a talk with LeBlanc at the diner.

37:10.953 --> 37:12.520
Before you say anything,

37:12.522 --> 37:14.856
he left with a broken wrist
and I got the information.

37:18.327 --> 37:21.795
Every time we get close, they slip away.

37:21.797 --> 37:24.398
Saving Jeremy was more
important, don't you think?

37:24.400 --> 37:27.935
Goddammit, you were supposed to call me!

37:27.937 --> 37:30.037
What is it, Clay?

37:30.039 --> 37:31.872
Are you angry because I was right?

37:31.874 --> 37:34.674
No, I'm pissed that you fight me on
every simple thing I ask you to do.

37:34.676 --> 37:37.243
Oh, I'm sorry that I don't
follow your orders.

37:37.245 --> 37:38.945
I'm trying to protect you.

37:38.947 --> 37:41.448
Where was that attitude four years ago?

37:44.318 --> 37:46.420
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

37:46.422 --> 37:51.057
I talked to Cain's girlfriend, Amber.

37:51.059 --> 37:53.626
She knows about us.

37:53.628 --> 37:55.995
About the werewolves.

37:55.997 --> 37:59.265
That's who he's protecting,
not the rest of the Mutts.

37:59.267 --> 38:01.767
She knows and you let her go?

38:03.304 --> 38:05.805
You're not listening to me.

38:07.507 --> 38:11.410
Cain fell in love with a girl so much so

38:11.412 --> 38:13.712
that he told her who he really was.

38:16.550 --> 38:18.884
He trusted her and she accepted it.

38:18.886 --> 38:20.185
Then she has to die.

38:20.187 --> 38:22.354
Don't you see?

38:22.356 --> 38:25.223
No matter how much
she asks him to bite her,

38:25.225 --> 38:27.725
he can't do it because
he's afraid of losing her.

38:29.562 --> 38:33.265
He won't take that chance
and he won't risk her life.

38:35.501 --> 38:37.669
That's love!

38:54.521 --> 38:56.988
Oh, is that supposed to scare me?

39:05.163 --> 39:07.264
You son of a bitch!

39:18.007 --> 39:21.710
There's no point in pretending anymore.

39:21.712 --> 39:23.478
I know about Amber.

39:26.149 --> 39:27.648
No.

39:27.650 --> 39:29.383
No, you got to listen to me.

39:29.385 --> 39:31.986
- You got to...
- You told her about us.

39:31.988 --> 39:33.787
She knows.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.189
Yeah, but she won't say anything.

39:35.191 --> 39:36.924
You got to believe me,
you got to believe me.

39:36.926 --> 39:38.326
Tell me where they're hiding.

39:38.328 --> 39:39.660
I can't, you'll kill her.

39:39.662 --> 39:42.396
I have to kill her anyways.

39:42.398 --> 39:44.498
Maybe I'll let her have her wish.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.834
I'll find her in the night
and I'll bite her,

39:46.836 --> 39:48.502
only I won't stop biting.

39:48.504 --> 39:50.003
No, it's Santos.

39:50.005 --> 39:52.072
He has a backup plan...
I heard him on his phone.

39:52.074 --> 39:54.241
- Tell me where they're hiding!
- It's Jimmy Koenig!

39:54.243 --> 39:56.577
He's coming real soon, Clay.

39:56.579 --> 39:59.045
Please.

39:59.047 --> 40:01.014
Don't hurt her.

40:01.016 --> 40:03.583
Kill me, but don't hurt her.

40:03.585 --> 40:06.019
Don't hurt her. Look at me, Clay.

40:06.021 --> 40:07.153
Look...

40:07.155 --> 40:09.856
Don't hurt her. Don't hurt her.

40:17.532 --> 40:19.499
Do you love her?

40:19.501 --> 40:23.235
More than anything.

40:23.237 --> 40:26.238
Is that why you joined Santos?

40:26.240 --> 40:28.808
'Cause you knew what we'd do
if we found out about her?

40:28.810 --> 40:33.279
I just want to protect
her and keep her safe.

40:33.281 --> 40:37.116
Do you play out your life
with her in your head?

40:37.118 --> 40:39.818
Picture the two of you
growing old together?

40:42.655 --> 40:43.956
All the time.

40:48.594 --> 40:50.295
You imagine what it'd
be like to have kids?

40:52.732 --> 40:54.032
A family you never had?

41:01.340 --> 41:03.675
Yeah. She's my soul mate.

41:10.615 --> 41:12.483
Ah...

41:16.455 --> 41:20.158
You were right about one thing.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.259
Yeah?

41:29.034 --> 41:32.035
Oh, my God!

41:32.037 --> 41:35.739
For killing Pete,
you will never be forgiven.

42:09.439 --> 42:10.640
You're looking better.

42:10.642 --> 42:12.008
Were you able to reach Logan?

42:12.010 --> 42:13.675
I texted him a few times.

42:13.677 --> 42:15.478
I didn't hear back.

42:15.480 --> 42:17.146
But I can see he's picking them up.

42:17.148 --> 42:19.482
You need to find out
what's going on with him.

42:22.185 --> 42:24.353
What?

42:24.355 --> 42:25.888
I want your opinion.

42:25.890 --> 42:28.724
I'm never going to fill
my father's shoes.

42:28.726 --> 42:30.759
I wouldn't even try.

42:30.761 --> 42:32.494
Go on, Nick.

42:32.496 --> 42:34.630
Logan knows his place.

42:34.632 --> 42:36.398
We'll hear from him.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.033
Right now, we need to focus

42:38.035 --> 42:40.636
on finding Marsten, Santos, LeBlanc,

42:40.638 --> 42:42.804
and anyone else in league with them.

42:42.806 --> 42:45.706
I will kill them myself with pleasure.

42:47.411 --> 42:49.777
- Cain?
- He's done.

42:49.779 --> 42:50.978
I'll help you with the body.

42:50.980 --> 42:52.780
It's my responsibility.

42:52.782 --> 42:54.215
I'll deal with it.

42:56.785 --> 42:59.487
We have another problem.

42:59.489 --> 43:02.957
Santos hired Jimmy Koenig.

43:02.959 --> 43:04.425
He's coming for us.

43:06.929 --> 43:09.697
Koenig... why do I know that name?

43:09.699 --> 43:11.732
He was the Pack enforcer,

43:11.734 --> 43:14.035
long before I became Alpha.

43:14.037 --> 43:16.236
You know all those files
about dead Mutts down there?

43:17.972 --> 43:21.041
Koenig is responsible for most of them.

43:21.043 --> 43:24.445

43:54.976 --> 43:56.708

43:56.710 --> 43:59.043
right here, right now in this moment.

44:01.380 --> 44:05.550
