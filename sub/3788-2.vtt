01:42.436 --> 01:43.853
Vagina Monologues.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.773
Me and Faustino
are putting it up in class tonight.

01:46.857 --> 01:49.233
Vagina Monologues,
I thought that was for girls.

01:49.318 --> 01:53.654
It's a gender reversal exercise, bro.
That's what being a good actor's all about.

01:53.739 --> 01:56.616
Sorry, Drama. I thought you already had
your gender reversed.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.700
Funny, dick.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.661
E, I decided we're going with the Benz.

02:00.746 --> 02:03.247
You're sure?
You changed your mind 10 times already.

02:03.332 --> 02:06.167
No, I'm set. I had a dream about it last night.

02:06.251 --> 02:09.920
I dreamt about it last night, too, Vince.
We're cruising down Rodeo.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.006
Suddenly two jerk-offs pull up and say:

02:12.090 --> 02:13.966
"Chase brothers, fuck your mother!"

02:14.051 --> 02:15.468
And then open fire.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.595
It had to be a dream.
Somebody recognized you?

02:17.679 --> 02:18.888
DRAMA: That's funny.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.390
You're gonna love this. This is really good.

02:21.475 --> 02:25.228
- You put soy milk in these again?
- You're lactose intolerant. Don't fight it.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.064
Vince, they got the stains
out of your black Dolces.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.148
VINCE: Cool.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.317
I only got you nine iPods. They ran out.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.653
- Did you get The Trades?
- Right here, boss.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.781
- I'm just warning you. It ain't pretty.
- VINCE: Oh, really?

02:36.865 --> 02:39.075
Fucking prick called you a thespian.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.536
Read it out loud, E.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.790
You don't want to hear this, Vince.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.750
Come on, man. I'm a big boy.

about me when Viking Quest aired?

Yeah. You're a real beauty queen, Drama.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.497
- You all right?
- Yeah. Whatever.

03:26.582 --> 03:29.250
Good or bad, you can't let
what these people say affect you.

- Oh, yeah? Where'd you grow up?

I grew up out here.

It's the girl's first day.
You really needed to hassle her?

04:53.627 --> 04:56.879
You order something unusual,
people will never forget you.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.548
I think E's got something for that Emily.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.051
Seriously.
'Cause I'm always ordering weird shit,

05:02.135 --> 05:04.553

it's become a problem?

just got his heart broken.

to be the first one in there. Take a number.

about this review?

No. It's not even a real paper, Vince.
It's Variety.

I'm not worried. I think Eric's worried.

No, I'm not. I mean, it's a bad review.
I would've preferred a good one, but...

- What's your point?
- ERIC: My point is, what're we doing?

06:35.479 --> 06:36.520
- What are we doing?
- Yeah.

06:36.605 --> 06:37.563
What are we doing?

06:37.647 --> 06:41.734
- What are we doing about Vince's next job?
- I got Vince his next job. It's Matterhorn!

06:41.818 --> 06:45.112
You passed on it, remember?
He passed on your next job, Vince.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.573
The guy doesn't want to make money.
He's a communist.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.408
Are you a communist or a socialist?

06:49.493 --> 06:51.660
Or didn't you learn the difference
at Pepperoni U?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.245
And what are you, a Rhodes scholar?

06:53.330 --> 06:56.749
I'm a lowly Harvard grad
with a J.D. /M.B.A. From Michigan. That's it.

- Yeah.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.419
What'd they do at Harvard?

07:00.504 --> 07:01.754
- They row.
- No, they crew.

07:01.838 --> 07:02.880
- Crew.
- They crew.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.674
Vince, we gotta get you a real manager.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.928
Why pay 10%
when I got E over here for $4,000 a month?

07:09.012 --> 07:11.222
Cash.
Where are those scripts we talked about?

07:11.306 --> 07:13.390
Emily, scripts!
I pay my dog-walker $4,000 a month.

- Yeah, let's hack it up.

We're in great shape.
We're gonna open huge.

Hang back.
I want to bounce some scripts off your boy.

07:42.921 --> 07:45.548

Why did you bring up a bad review?

07:55.892 --> 07:58.018
- You said it didn't matter.
- It does matter.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.812
Everyone in this town reads that thing.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.983
I got more calls about this stupid-ass thing
than I did when my mother passed away.

We got 200 reviews coming out on Friday.
If they're like this, we're in deep shit.

before the movie comes out.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.170
He's got meetings coming up,
scripts to read.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.505
He must keep focused.
Have a good time with him.

08:26.590 --> 08:29.592
- Keep his mind off that fucking review.
- Yeah. You're right.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.010

08:32.095 --> 08:34.346
- Yeah. You're right.
- Ah! I'm kidding.

- Don't fucking mention that review again!
- I'm not.

08:37.601 --> 08:38.851

08:38.934 --> 08:41.395
- No, not really.
- Let's hug it out, bitch.

Let's hug it out.

The Orange County Register said

08:47.569 --> 08:49.361
I was a functioning retard.

08:49.446 --> 08:52.698
- Now, that was a bad review.
- I thought that was a compliment.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.242
You should come and check out
this class with me.

08:55.327 --> 08:58.370
You gotta audition to get in.
But since you're legacy...

08:58.455 --> 09:00.206
You think I need an acting class?

09:00.290 --> 09:03.375
You don't need an acting class, Vince.
Let's go get you a car.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.085

09:05.170 --> 09:08.172
Uh, good stuff. I got a box of scripts to read.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.425
- So it's all good?
- Yeah, it's all good.

09:11.509 --> 09:14.720
- Let's go get you a Benz.
- Fuck the fucking Mercedes, Vince.

You want a car? I know what to get you.

When you drive a Rolls-Royce,
you are making a statement.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.341
And how expensive is this statement?

09:52.425 --> 09:55.135
- $320,000.
- Not bad.

I'll give it to you for $319,000.

the houses we grew up in.

A fucking Subaru costs more
than the houses we grew up in.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.743
I don't know.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.830
- Think I should buy this car?
- Come on, are you serious?

10:22.914 --> 10:27.001
- You're gonna spend $320,000 on a car?
- So you don't think I should do it.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.004
I didn't say you shouldn't do it.

- So I'm gonna do it.

22:34.603 --> 22:35.979
(CHUCKLING)

22:37.273 --> 22:38.398
Look.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.736
Take a look. Look where we are.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.364
Did you ever think we'd have this?

22:47.408 --> 22:49.451
Man, enjoy it. Have fun.

22:49.744 --> 22:50.910
Worst comes to worst,

22:50.995 --> 22:53.705
we'll go tear it up in Queens,
like we always have.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.374
Fucking Turtle's out front,
christening the Rolls.

22:56.459 --> 22:59.294
Great. A day old,
it's already gotta be detailed.

23:00.171 --> 23:03.423
You know what?
We look like assholes in that thing anyway.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.884
Get rid of it. Return it tomorrow, E.

23:05.968 --> 23:07.802
You took a three-year lease.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.804
You'll figure it out.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.474
What a view!

23:13.893 --> 23:17.437
DRAMA: We're at a party
with some of the hottest girls in the world,

23:17.605 --> 23:20.315
and we're staring
at a bunch of fucking lights.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.360
- Let's go find you a girl, E.
- Yeah.

23:24.779 --> 23:26.029
What about me?

23:33.829 --> 23:35.997
ERIC: I don't wanna
go back to Queens, Vince.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.415
DRAMA: Who the fuck's
going back to Queens?

23:37.500 --> 23:39.834
VINCE: Nobody's going back to Queens.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.303
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

23:51.388 --> 23:53.181
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

23:53.974 --> 23:54.974
It's Ari.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.269
Yeah?

24:02.316 --> 24:04.025
All right. I'll tell him.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.613
New York Times says
you're the next Johnny Depp.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.366
Cool.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.618
You guys wanna go look at houses today?

24:13.702 --> 24:15.578
Yeah, baby. (LAUGHING)

24:15.663 --> 24:18.748
Let's get one with an outdoor pool, though.
I'm getting all pasty.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.668
- ERIC: Indoor pool's overrated.
- Hurry up with that bone, man.

24:21.752 --> 24:22.919
TURTLE: It's coming.

24:24.922 --> 24:26.840
