This is a charming story.

01:10.052 --> 01:11.386

The black sheep of
the family, sal --

01:13.356 --> 01:15.157
He needs our counsel.

01:15.191 --> 01:17.092
Apparently he works in
a chop shop downtown.

to get out of the business --

01:20.665 --> 01:22.099
Go straight, as it were.

01:22.133 --> 01:25.068
So he discussed with his
colleagues an exit strategy.

01:25.103 --> 01:27.038
Exit strategy? Why?

01:27.072 --> 01:29.976
Yes, he beat them unconscious
with a monkey wrench,

01:30.010 --> 01:31.845
Put all three of them in hospital.

01:31.879 --> 01:33.647
Now, the prosecution is claiming

01:33.681 --> 01:36.350
That it was premeditated
and that he jumped them.

01:36.384 --> 01:40.054
The evidence to counter
this is, uh, rather thin.

I cracked their skulls

02:03.813 --> 02:04.947
No. No. No.

02:04.981 --> 02:06.715
They outnumbered you,

02:06.750 --> 02:08.783
And so you fought off your attackers

02:08.818 --> 02:10.353

Come on, sal. We've been

02:19.397 --> 02:20.731
Okay.

02:20.765 --> 02:22.099

...With the lawyers on
this case. I'm itchy.

08:40.769 --> 08:45.206
Now, I'm going to ask
most of the questions,

08:45.240 --> 08:48.542

08:48.577 --> 08:51.945
Or let the lawyers ask their own.

Now, if you have a question,

You may write it down
or hand it to a bailiff.

08:57.118 --> 08:58.952

08:58.986 --> 09:01.621
May I say that this is the
best collection of jurors

09:01.655 --> 09:03.122

09:03.157 --> 09:04.757
No, you may not.

09:04.791 --> 09:07.660
It is a jury all-star team here.

09:07.727 --> 09:10.229
Your honor, that was highly
inappropriate behavior

09:10.263 --> 09:13.098
From someone who has,
well, written the book

09:13.133 --> 09:15.033
On highly inappropriate behavior.

09:15.068 --> 09:17.102
Judge vincent: Mr.
Bash and mr. Franklin,

09:17.136 --> 09:20.238
That was warning number one.

09:20.272 --> 09:23.574
The next step is contempt.

09:23.609 --> 09:24.942
You got it, your honor.

09:24.977 --> 09:26.911
And, your honor, we
apologize to d.A. Hewett,

09:26.945 --> 09:28.712
Who was unfortunately correct

09:28.747 --> 09:30.781
In preventing us from praising the jury.

09:30.816 --> 09:32.583
Let's get started.

defense would ask the court

09:50.170 --> 09:52.604

I'm a butcher at podesto meats.

you been in business?

09:58.045 --> 09:59.679

they see the pictures

He seems nice. And I never miss mass.

challenged one juror.

All right, so far,
we and the prosecution

10:31.377 --> 10:33.645
Have agreed on eight jurors.

10:33.679 --> 10:36.214
For a self-defense argument,
I like who we have so far.

10:36.248 --> 10:39.050
We got the sheep, but we need
the shepherds. Why, bonnie?

10:39.084 --> 10:40.952
The majority of jurors are followers.

alphas want to lead them.

We've used seven peremptory
challenges. They've used two.

11:01.073 --> 11:02.407
Eight. We've used eight?

11:02.441 --> 11:04.709
We've used 8 out of 10

challenge any of our jury choices.

He was letting us pick our
jury based on self-defense.

12:15.014 --> 12:17.049
Now that strategy is toast.

- Clinton wanted a centrist.
- What'd you do?

We used the republicans.

We leaked word that clinton
was in love with laurence tribe.

28:33.998 --> 28:36.666
Oh, the opposition said
he was unconfirmable.

28:36.734 --> 28:39.803

to push for ruth bader ginsburg.

Maybe once a week.

She went to orlando in July.
I stayed away from the store.

Longest 30 days of my life.

That he was in that store
every day buying a tchotchke

32:56.999 --> 32:58.967
We don't have any gift receipts.

32:59.001 --> 33:02.971

his credibility a little shaky.

33:03.006 --> 33:04.507
Right. Which leaves us with kiki.

That the only time she
didn't get a gift from sal

33:07.945 --> 33:09.579
Was when annabel was on vacation.

want to help the "other woman."

wouldn't ask any questions?

the "other woman" thing.

from another woman he loves

hands on a bible and save him?!

Did we not say "please"?

<i>I believe you mean the
hook has been baited.</i>

37:12.833 --> 37:15.001
We don't know if the prosecution
has taken the bait yet

37:15.035 --> 37:16.135
For the hook to be set.

37:16.170 --> 37:18.237
Really? Do a lot of fly-fishing?

37:18.272 --> 37:20.707
Technically, you don't use a bait when
you're fly-fishing. What you use is a --

37:20.741 --> 37:23.176
Okay. Guys, guys, guys. Eye on the ball.

37:23.210 --> 37:25.712
We're gonna argue that unrequited love

37:25.746 --> 37:28.014
Drove sal gotelli to
protect a pretty shopgirl

37:28.048 --> 37:29.349
Named annabel brady... Annabel.

37:29.383 --> 37:31.785
...From three thugs
who wanted to hurt her.

37:31.819 --> 37:34.053
Let's just hope the district
attorney is basing their case

37:34.088 --> 37:35.588
On us arguing unrequited love.

37:35.622 --> 37:36.789
What if he doesn't?

37:36.824 --> 37:38.657
Well, we picked our key jury members

37:38.692 --> 37:40.259
Based on this defense. Yeah,
let's put it this way, sal --

37:40.293 --> 37:41.860
If the prosecution
doesn't call your friend

37:41.894 --> 37:43.996
Kiki parker to the stand, you'll lose.

37:44.030 --> 37:45.297
If they do, we'll win.

37:45.332 --> 37:46.732
And you go free.

37:46.766 --> 37:48.334
Really? Just like that?

37:48.368 --> 37:50.870
Trials are won and lost based
on how you pick your jury.

37:51.972 --> 37:53.739
And our jury is primed for love.

37:53.774 --> 37:55.207
For better or worse.

38:10.056 --> 38:11.323
Good luck today, counsel.

38:11.358 --> 38:14.927
And to you, mr. District attorney.

38:14.961 --> 38:17.162
It's been like old times.

38:17.197 --> 38:18.897
When this is all over, we'll be even

38:18.932 --> 38:20.866
For what you did to
me at megget and towne.

38:20.900 --> 38:24.102
[ chuckles ] are you presuming victory?

38:24.137 --> 38:26.438
No. He's guaranteeing it.

38:38.250 --> 38:41.052
Before we go in,

38:41.086 --> 38:43.187
I just want to say
what an honor it's been

38:43.221 --> 38:45.256
To observe such a legendary trial team.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.194
I feel the same way.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.899
"good-luck hug"
time. No, we --

38:54.933 --> 38:57.200
Oh. A hug. Okay.

39:03.906 --> 39:05.902
No!

39:05.937 --> 39:07.971
[ grunts ]

39:10.708 --> 39:11.841
[ chuckles ]

39:11.875 --> 39:13.342
Hey, summer girl.

39:13.377 --> 39:14.810
Yes, mr. Franklin?

39:14.845 --> 39:17.346
[ chuckles ] your father would be proud.

39:24.053 --> 39:26.354
We will now hear
opening statements --

39:26.389 --> 39:28.423
First, from the prosecution.

39:28.457 --> 39:29.958
Mr. Hewett?

39:34.029 --> 39:37.363
Thank you, your honor.

39:37.398 --> 39:40.700
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, as I speak to you now,

39:40.734 --> 39:44.370
Three men, victims of a vicious beating

39:44.404 --> 39:48.441
Administered by the man
sitting behind me, sal gotelli,

39:48.475 --> 39:52.945
Are still recovering
from their injuries.

39:52.980 --> 39:58.284
At one time, these men
called sal gotelli a friend.

39:58.319 --> 40:00.086
[ scoffs ]

40:00.121 --> 40:04.924
But what kind of friend
jumps another friend

40:04.958 --> 40:09.095
And beats them over
the head with a wrench?

40:10.230 --> 40:11.364
This friend.

40:13.100 --> 40:15.267
Now, the defense will argue

40:15.302 --> 40:17.736
That sal gotelli is a good man...

40:17.771 --> 40:20.339
A hardworking man.

40:20.373 --> 40:22.408
The defense will also
try to get you to believe

40:22.442 --> 40:26.078
That sal gotelli was a man in love.

40:26.113 --> 40:28.147
Yeah.

40:28.182 --> 40:30.249
They will argue that sal gotelli

40:30.284 --> 40:34.954
Loved a woman from
afar named annabel brady

40:34.989 --> 40:39.959
And that he was just trying to
protect her from the victims.

40:41.195 --> 40:43.830
Well, not only will
we disprove the notion

40:43.864 --> 40:45.965
That sal gotelli was a man in love

40:45.999 --> 40:49.269
With a shopgirl whom the
defense can't even locate,

40:49.303 --> 40:52.906
<i>But we will introduce the
woman he really    loved --</i>

40:52.940 --> 40:56.842
His real girlfriend...

40:56.877 --> 40:58.177
Kiki parker.

41:00.948 --> 41:05.385
And then, you, ladies and gentlemen...

41:05.453 --> 41:08.321
You will decide...

41:08.355 --> 41:11.591
Who is telling the truth.

41:11.592 --> 41:16.031
