WEBVTT

00:01.390 --> 00:05.000
the struggle for live starts with the Knockouts!

00:12.945 --> 00:15.397
At this stage, the artists will make the choice

00:15.432 --> 00:17.217
of which song to sing.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.282
"My Church"
do Maren Morris.

00:19.283 --> 00:21.579
- I love this song. - It's full of words.

00:21.614 --> 00:24.498
Don't let me downnnnn.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.746
Getting more intense with the individual training

00:26.747 --> 00:28.122
from our coaches

00:28.133 --> 00:31.681
Sometimes, how emotional you get can derail the performance.

00:31.682 --> 00:35.891
I want you to take the intensity and put full force. Bring it on.

00:35.926 --> 00:37.700
I was singing, but I was not feeling.

00:37.701 --> 00:39.553
I want you from the real place

00:39.588 --> 00:42.446
Knockouts have a lot of pressure, but I need to see who is ready

00:42.447 --> 00:43.850
pro live, and who is not.

00:43.851 --> 00:45.151
And for the 1st time ...

00:45.152 --> 00:47.449
You will watch each other's test.

00:47.995 --> 00:49.959
- Next victim! - You are professional

00:49.960 --> 00:51.561
how to cause heart attack.

00:51.562 --> 00:55.940
It is intimidating because TSoul is like a unicorn.

00:56.688 --> 00:58.004
It is.

01:00.566 --> 01:04.191
The knockouts are the most competitive in history.

01:06.595 --> 01:08.796
The artists hope to represent their mentors

01:08.797 --> 01:10.653
Classifiers in Live ...

01:10.688 --> 01:12.997
Thank you, God, for letting me witness it.

01:12.998 --> 01:15.613
You come here and make a Grammy performance.

01:15.648 --> 01:17.422
I get chills.

01:17.457 --> 01:19.859
You are a new species which had not yet seen.

01:19.860 --> 01:21.411
Or expect to prove another mentor

01:21.412 --> 01:23.146
they deserve to be ...

01:29.770 --> 01:31.445
America, get ready ...

01:32.198 --> 01:36.093
The biggest night of knockouts is starting!

01:38.723 --> 01:40.701
Boys, boys, boys!

01:40.736 --> 01:42.771
- They felt our lack? - Wow!

01:43.300 --> 01:45.833
Hello guys! See us. We are ...

01:45.836 --> 01:47.808
- We do not know. - We are a group!

01:47.809 --> 01:49.169
Me and Blake are combining,

01:49.170 --> 01:51.510
I dress well and he dresses badly.

01:51.511 --> 01:52.811
But see, he's got the button

01:52.812 --> 01:54.921
- on the jacket. Beautiful. - Thank you, Alicia.

01:54.956 --> 01:57.466
- You're welcome. - Let the Knockouts!

01:57.869 --> 01:59.470
While the mentors are accommodated,

01:59.471 --> 02:02.416
we will see the first knockout of Alicia Team.

02:02.451 --> 02:04.473
I put Chris and Quizz together because

02:04.508 --> 02:07.183
both have this soul vibe , R & B.

02:07.275 --> 02:09.312
Chris has the power to reach,

02:09.348 --> 02:12.057
and Quizz is innocence that is genuine.

02:12.058 --> 02:14.159
They have much to learn from each other.

02:14.433 --> 02:17.365
- I want the first hug. - Quizz Hi!

02:17.400 --> 02:19.245
She just left the best for last.

02:19.592 --> 02:22.486
- How are you doing? - And your family? Your bride?

02:22.521 --> 02:24.762
It goes well. It has all this way.

02:24.767 --> 02:27.440
How is your family? It has a new baby in the area?

02:27.441 --> 02:29.373
I have a new baby brother! His name is

02:29.374 --> 02:32.221
Courtney DeMarcus
Jai Swanigan Jr.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.339
We'll do things differently.

02:35.433 --> 02:36.800
I'll start with Chris.

02:36.803 --> 02:39.951
Quizz, you watch Chris and our interaction,

02:40.415 --> 02:43.797
then exchanged and you watch Quizz.

02:43.970 --> 02:47.024
We give a little more intensity.

02:47.025 --> 02:48.386
Well, are you ready?

02:50.300 --> 02:51.847
Big brother and little brother.

02:53.692 --> 02:55.435
I am the youngest among seven brothers,

02:55.470 --> 02:57.237
grow has been very difficult.

02:57.238 --> 03:00.330
I grew up in a house that had four rooms,

03:00.620 --> 03:03.121
We never counted the bathroom because it never worked.

03:03.277 --> 03:05.497
Finalmente estou no The Voice,

03:05.532 --> 03:09.019
It was a moment of relief.

03:09.054 --> 03:11.864
By Team Alicia, Chris Blue!

03:12.327 --> 03:14.825
Alicia Keys was destined to be my mentor.

03:14.970 --> 03:18.458
Being under his leadership is the best thing in the world.

03:26.350 --> 03:27.652
I want her to know

03:27.653 --> 03:30.180
believe me it was the right decision.

03:30.215 --> 03:33.510
In the hearings, I said that someone was waiting for me.

03:33.545 --> 03:36.208
Nobody can push me, they were upset.

03:36.243 --> 03:38.196
I'm regretting much about it.

03:40.537 --> 03:45.091
I know how to sleep without anything down.

03:46.655 --> 03:48.436
That is why it is important.

03:49.833 --> 03:51.762
I have to win this knockout.

03:53.709 --> 03:55.038
I have to win.

03:55.467 --> 03:59.310
For the knockout, I chose "Superstition" of Stevie Wonder.

04:00.600 --> 04:04.787
I can see myself as an artist soul and pop,

04:04.788 --> 04:07.158
then "Superstition" was perfect.

04:09.038 --> 04:11.468
After seeing Chris, I'm a little nervous.

04:11.469 --> 04:13.725
It has a great presence,

04:13.760 --> 04:16.740
It is older than me, has experience.

04:16.774 --> 04:19.440
I feel that means I'll have to work hard.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.887
It was good, it was great.

04:20.923 --> 04:24.787
The only thing is that you never miss ...

04:28.886 --> 04:30.490
has a lot going on!

04:30.770 --> 04:34.818
In the second verse, she did not yield to decrease a little,

04:34.853 --> 04:37.813
It got a little rough to remember people

04:38.167 --> 04:40.058
you're beyond that.

04:40.059 --> 04:41.359
Would be crazy!

04:41.360 --> 04:44.546
If you want the time to show everything you can do,

04:44.744 --> 04:47.992
the space is all yours!

04:48.034 --> 04:50.042
"Superstition" has an energy,

04:50.043 --> 04:51.515
but it has too much to compete.

04:51.550 --> 04:55.145
His challenge is to use the space.

04:55.645 --> 04:59.005
Musically and vocally dance

04:59.040 --> 05:01.716
in a way that it is quite natural.

05:08.667 --> 05:10.332
I have to win this knockout,

05:10.333 --> 05:14.299
because me and my girlfriend want to get married in July,

05:14.300 --> 05:16.432
and I want her to feel safe.

05:16.433 --> 05:18.434
Being in The Voice is more than a dream.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.753
Ok, Quizz, we are ready for you.

05:22.667 --> 05:24.200
I'm just kidding.

05:24.201 --> 05:26.255
- Just kidding! - I know I'm short.

05:26.256 --> 05:28.626
- I'm so small. -. No. You're perfect.

05:28.627 --> 05:29.927
Its height is perfect.

05:29.928 --> 05:35.550
As an artist, mix styles like pop, soul, R & B .

05:36.033 --> 05:38.332
It is very important to win this knockout.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.700
I am 13 years old.

05:40.129 --> 05:41.867
We never had anyone with 13 years.

05:41.870 --> 05:44.966
Since I am the youngest of all seasons,

05:44.967 --> 05:46.600
I have to push myself further

05:46.601 --> 05:47.901
than the older,

05:47.902 --> 05:49.800
because they have more experience.

05:57.067 --> 05:58.367
It takes a lot of commitment,

05:58.368 --> 06:00.502
but I know I can face the big dogs.

06:00.970 --> 06:03.945
For the knockout, I chose "Chains", Nick Jonas.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.000
13 years, I have some insecurities,

06:09.003 --> 06:10.667
They are as chains,

06:10.670 --> 06:12.167
and I'm trying to free myself.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.299
I have to face this guy?

06:19.300 --> 06:20.799
The boy is amazing.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.568
I have to be ready for it.

06:22.603 --> 06:24.866
- I was excellent. - It was mind-blowing.

06:24.867 --> 06:27.866
You have to stretch.

06:27.867 --> 06:29.833
I want you to stretch ...

06:32.867 --> 06:34.433
If you can...

06:37.500 --> 06:39.500
You do not do this every second,

06:39.503 --> 06:43.200
but I want the audience to be impressed, like ...

06:43.201 --> 06:45.732
"Wow, this kid is ..."

06:45.733 --> 06:47.500
- Are you understanding? - Yes ma'am.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.100
He's getting better,

06:54.101 --> 06:55.733
and every time an idea haul

06:55.736 --> 06:57.333
it is time.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.700
- That's exactly. - Yes ma'am. Thank you.

06:59.701 --> 07:01.432
As sente, Chris?

07:01.433 --> 07:02.733
I have work to do.

07:02.734 --> 07:05.066
To decide who will win the knockout,

07:05.067 --> 07:07.699
I have to assess who evolved more.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.200
Like, I'll enjoy watching most?

07:11.401 --> 07:13.100
difficult decisions ahead.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.966
Help me!

07:14.967 --> 07:18.000
Cantando "Superstition",
aqui est Chris Blue.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.962
I want you all clapping! Come on!

07:28.267 --> 07:30.448
Very superstitious

07:32.900 --> 07:35.467
Writings on the wall

07:36.800 --> 07:38.200
That's it.

07:38.201 --> 07:40.381
Very superstitious

07:42.267 --> 07:45.332
Ladders 'bout to fall

07:47.167 --> 07:51.299
13-month-old baby

07:51.618 --> 07:54.633
Broke the looking glass

07:56.467 --> 07:59.999
Seven years of bad luck

08:00.770 --> 08:04.232
Good things in your past

08:06.333 --> 08:08.967
If you believe in things

08:08.968 --> 08:11.299
That you don't understand

08:11.300 --> 08:14.640
You will suffer

08:14.641 --> 08:18.700
Superstition ain't the way

08:20.200 --> 08:25.000
Very superstitious
'Stitious

08:25.001 --> 08:28.179
Nothing more to say

08:29.601 --> 08:33.296
Very superstitious

08:33.767 --> 08:36.866
The devil's on his way

08:38.700 --> 08:41.166
13-month-old baby

08:43.400 --> 08:45.800
Broke the looking glass

08:47.767 --> 08:51.686
Seven years of bad luck

08:53.100 --> 08:55.266
Good things is in your past

08:57.933 --> 09:00.985
If you believe in things

09:01.020 --> 09:03.373
That you don't understand

09:03.408 --> 09:05.584
You will suffer

09:06.267 --> 09:11.734
Superstition ain't the way

09:16.411 --> 09:22.151
It ain't the way

09:26.067 --> 09:27.800
Oh my!

09:28.231 --> 09:29.540
That's the guy!

09:29.682 --> 09:31.875
This is the guy I have spoken!

09:32.085 --> 09:33.393
Not jokes!

09:33.933 --> 09:37.900
Isso, Quiz!

09:38.133 --> 09:41.900
Singing "Chains", here's Quizz Swaningan.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.350
With her wine-stained lips

09:49.351 --> 09:52.635
Yeah, she's nothing but trouble

09:54.167 --> 09:55.500
Cold to the touch

09:55.501 --> 10:00.095
But she's warm as a devil

10:00.400 --> 10:01.917
I gave her my heart

10:01.918 --> 10:05.124
But she wanted my soul

10:05.159 --> 10:06.794
Oh, no

10:06.829 --> 10:08.134
She takes till I break

10:08.135 --> 10:10.555
And I can't get more

10:12.400 --> 10:15.310
You got me in chains

10:15.488 --> 10:17.100
You got me in chains

10:17.101 --> 10:18.532
For your love

10:18.533 --> 10:21.774
But I wouldn't change, no

10:21.809 --> 10:25.066
No, I wouldn't change this love

10:25.067 --> 10:28.026
You got me chains

10:28.173 --> 10:29.650
You got me chains

10:29.651 --> 10:31.166
For your love

10:31.167 --> 10:34.454
But I wouldn't change, no

10:34.501 --> 10:37.999
No, I wouldn't change this love

10:38.500 --> 10:39.800
Try to break the chains

10:39.801 --> 10:42.982
But the chains only break me

10:44.000 --> 10:50.074

10:51.500 --> 10:54.150
Listen, let me tell you
Something

10:54.151 --> 10:55.517
Baby, tell me why

10:55.518 --> 10:57.299
Why you do, do me wrong?

10:57.300 --> 10:58.800
Baby, tell me why

10:58.801 --> 11:00.466
Why you do, do me wrong?

11:00.467 --> 11:01.795
Gave you my heart

11:01.796 --> 11:06.543
But you took my soul

11:06.910 --> 11:09.016
Chains

11:09.330 --> 11:13.613
Chains

11:15.579 --> 11:19.024
I wouldn't change this love

11:19.481 --> 11:22.518
Chains

11:22.700 --> 11:25.075
Chains for you love

11:25.110 --> 11:28.105
But I wouldn't change, no

11:28.140 --> 11:31.707
No, I wouldn't change this love

Try to break the chains

11:33.562 --> 11:38.302
But the chains only break me

11:41.867 --> 11:45.300
Applause for Chris and Quizz!

11:50.600 --> 11:53.298
Alicia Keys, who Knockout!

11:53.333 --> 11:55.616
- Help! - two incredible performances.

11:55.651 --> 11:57.900
Impressive. Gwen Stefani, what do you think?

11:57.901 --> 12:01.399
Chris, I think I'm the biggest fan you've ever had,

12:01.400 --> 12:03.932
because you are everything I love.

12:03.933 --> 12:07.650
What I like most is the way you do ...

12:09.100 --> 12:11.890
It's just ... Every time it's like ... incredible.

12:11.891 --> 12:13.191
What the hell was that?

12:13.192 --> 12:16.369
It's what he does! I do not know how to do it.

12:16.370 --> 12:18.000
It's too good and ...

12:21.533 --> 12:24.000
I honestly do not believe you're human

12:24.001 --> 12:25.467
and to sing that way.

12:25.468 --> 12:26.768
You are magical.

12:26.769 --> 12:28.240
But Quizz is unfolding

12:28.241 --> 12:31.000
and spins you made were lovely

12:31.001 --> 12:33.884
and it was a deep, full sound

12:33.885 --> 12:35.659
you had not shown before

12:35.660 --> 12:37.766
and I had no idea you had.

12:37.767 --> 12:39.399
You are also magical.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.667
Thank you, mentor. I appreciate it. Adam.

12:42.700 --> 12:45.000
Quizz had a trial by fire today.

12:45.035 --> 12:46.633
Because you have only 13 years.

12:46.636 --> 12:48.690
I'll tell you what would have happened to me.

12:48.691 --> 12:50.241
I would have peed my pants

12:50.900 --> 12:53.266
and run out the door screaming

12:53.367 --> 12:54.667
since Chris razed.

12:54.668 --> 12:59.732
But you came and had a responsibility superhuman.

12:59.733 --> 13:01.033
Congratulations.

13:01.034 --> 13:03.300
So, Chris, you were Chris.

13:03.301 --> 13:05.132
It is a phenomenon.

13:05.133 --> 13:06.610
I do not know how you move ...

13:06.611 --> 13:08.167
I will not try to do the same,

13:08.168 --> 13:09.750
I tried.

13:09.751 --> 13:11.999
because it will not be a good idea.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.900
- But ... - I take that back.

13:13.901 --> 13:17.800
Now I can not. It is on TV forever.

13:17.801 --> 13:20.133
You arrived in the competition and ...

13:20.136 --> 13:21.467
Amazing what you do.

13:21.470 --> 13:23.200
Thank you, Adam. Blake.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.766
If I am not wrong,

13:24.767 --> 13:27.300
you were the last artist in the hearings.

13:27.301 --> 13:28.632
It's insane.

13:28.633 --> 13:32.234
And I sent a message after his hearing

13:32.235 --> 13:33.750
to Gwen and pro Adam.

13:33.751 --> 13:35.132
Not sent to Alicia,

13:35.133 --> 13:39.166
because she must find it strange I have her number ...

13:39.167 --> 13:41.300
Which is understandable.

13:43.533 --> 13:45.060
It's funny because it's true.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.650
I was crazy, thinking, "can you believe it?"

13:49.651 --> 13:50.951
We do not even ...

13:50.952 --> 13:52.638
This guy will win The Voice.

13:52.639 --> 13:55.300
It is documented. I will show the message.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.132
I have not forgotten you, Quizz.

13:57.133 --> 13:59.899
The important thing about you is not have 13 years,

13:59.900 --> 14:02.466
but at this point of its development

14:02.467 --> 14:06.200
It is crucial you have a mentor, and she is Alicia Keys.

14:06.201 --> 14:07.835
What a chance for you.

14:07.836 --> 14:09.521
And a great opportunity for her

14:09.522 --> 14:10.900
working with this boy

14:10.901 --> 14:14.166
and help you on the path that it deserves.

14:14.167 --> 14:15.967
This was very manipulative.

14:15.970 --> 14:18.699
It's kind :, "I think Chris can win,

14:18.700 --> 14:21.764
but Alicia, you will leave the young Chris? "

14:21.765 --> 14:23.967
- It is true. - How do you sleep at night, man?

14:26.600 --> 14:29.332
Alicia, the final decision is yours.

14:29.333 --> 14:33.299
Quizz, you are very special.

14:33.300 --> 14:36.832
I am amazed to see who you will become.

14:36.833 --> 14:41.550
You are the youngest who have participated in the program

14:41.551 --> 14:43.533
and not without reason.

14:43.536 --> 14:45.632
I do not think any of us here

14:45.633 --> 14:48.399
would be able to do what you did earlier.

14:48.400 --> 14:52.300
You're amazing, honestly, really.

14:54.367 --> 14:56.966
Really.

14:56.967 --> 14:59.466
On the other hand, Chris, waited for you.

14:59.467 --> 15:02.032
I could not believe someone like you

15:02.346 --> 15:04.053
He returned to testify.

15:04.133 --> 15:06.999
You've become a wild animal!

15:07.000 --> 15:09.751
I've never seen something like that. Was very good.

15:09.786 --> 15:13.527
It's great to see him rampant, fearless

15:13.562 --> 15:15.023
and without fear.

15:15.058 --> 15:17.066
I'm very proud of you.

15:17.067 --> 15:19.129
- I love you, man. - Hard decision.

15:19.164 --> 15:22.420
I'm sorry, Alicia. Who wins the knockout?

15:29.067 --> 15:30.995
The winner of the knockout ...

15:33.033 --> 15:34.422
is Chris.

15:34.423 --> 15:37.593
Congratulations, Chris! This means that you

15:37.628 --> 15:40.337
will sing in the Classifiers Live.

15:40.839 --> 15:44.849
It was very difficult, but Chris is something unbelievable.

15:44.884 --> 15:47.650
He drops this whole building, like the Incredible Hulk.

15:47.733 --> 15:50.358
That's it man! Let's move on!

15:50.393 --> 15:52.939
It has the hoarseness of a rocker

15:52.974 --> 15:55.806
and that soul R & B.

15:55.807 --> 15:58.683
But I could also sing great pop songs.

15:58.767 --> 16:01.338
There are no boundaries for him.

16:01.373 --> 16:02.757
I'll pras live stage ?!

16:04.767 --> 16:07.676
That's how I feel it, man! We can do this now?

16:07.700 --> 16:09.735
I'm ready to sing!

16:10.378 --> 16:13.643
Mentors, noting that Quizz is available for theft.

16:14.157 --> 16:17.263
Quizz, you mean something for your mentor? Now is the time.

16:17.433 --> 16:20.144
I love you so much and I want to thank you for the opportunity.

16:21.145 --> 16:24.375
Ladies and gentlemen, applause for Quizz Swanigan.

16:24.410 --> 16:26.100
You're not kidding, Quizz.

16:28.923 --> 16:31.684
We have a theft in the Knockouts!

16:31.719 --> 16:33.164
It is by Quizz!

16:36.269 --> 16:39.225
It was easy to choose the Quizz. It is a boy of 13 years

16:39.428 --> 16:42.453
which has very gift. It is very talented.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.567
- You were great! - Thank you very much.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.138
It was great, man. Congratulations!

16:48.833 --> 16:52.143
That boy gave his all. He worked hard.

16:52.235 --> 16:53.699
We are very proud of it.

16:53.700 --> 16:57.694
Our family is happy and we can not wait to win it all.

16:57.735 --> 16:59.277
Also can not wait!

16:59.703 --> 17:01.064
So happy that I will win!

17:01.103 --> 17:02.870
I did not know this would happen today.

17:02.970 --> 17:04.633
What is amazing in this program.

17:04.634 --> 17:05.934
- We will work hard. - Yes!

17:05.935 --> 17:08.473
- See you later. - Thank you. God bless her.

17:09.512 --> 17:12.098
Alicia is the one that has a vacant place in the team.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.749
And here comes a guy who, I believe, can win the show.

17:15.767 --> 17:19.263
I even sent message to Adam. I still have it saved in the phone.

17:19.574 --> 17:22.103
- I think that message. - I know. I remember her.

17:23.099 --> 17:25.575
Next, our mentors prepare their teams ...

17:25.967 --> 17:27.396
Every word counts.

17:28.509 --> 17:30.786
- It is a compilation. - It's kind of tune,

17:30.787 --> 17:33.059
- because you're forcing. - I want to hear the "nerve".

17:33.536 --> 17:35.885
for the most competitive knockouts in history.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.997
Legendas:
Breeh ~ Clarice ~ Cris ~ Erika

17:46.998 --> 17:48.998
Legends: Gerson Loreine ~ ~ Luana

17:48.999 --> 17:50.999
Legends: Mari Marcia ~ ~ Veka

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Revision: Clarice-Mari

17:53.310 --> 17:56.860
We came back with the Knockouts, at Universal Studios, Hollywood.

17:59.302 --> 18:00.771
Everyone stretching.

18:03.310 --> 18:04.727
Blake never lengthened in life.

18:05.074 --> 18:07.513
If Blake try to stretch, will have back pain.

18:08.811 --> 18:10.111
Namaste , folks.

18:10.146 --> 18:12.031
- What? - Namaste .

18:12.137 --> 18:13.923
While Adam prepares mentally,

18:13.958 --> 18:15.926
we see the double of their knockout.

18:16.757 --> 18:19.217
Autumn and Hanna have a lot of strength,

18:19.289 --> 18:21.997
but I can not have two singers occupying the same space.

18:22.056 --> 18:25.163
We have to be selective with who'll take you to sing live.

18:27.664 --> 18:29.028
Autumn e Hanna!

18:29.510 --> 18:30.925
Cumprimentarei a novata primeiro.

18:31.150 --> 18:33.424
- She is new to the team. - Thanks!

18:33.737 --> 18:35.344
- How are you? - Good! Is that you?

18:35.800 --> 18:37.236
We met. We have a past!

18:37.779 --> 18:40.582
Hanna is literally the sweetest person.

18:40.998 --> 18:42.766
What she ever does is to let you fool.

18:43.226 --> 18:45.555
Autumn Alicia stole the team. It's a great singer.

18:45.556 --> 18:47.329
She still has a long journey here.

18:47.330 --> 18:49.932
Autumn, you go first. So Hanna, sit down.

18:51.641 --> 18:53.956
My mother alone raised me.

18:54.062 --> 18:58.124
She showed me how to live life as a young woman.

18:58.335 --> 19:02.219
After participating in a group of girls and almost succeed,

19:02.278 --> 19:04.994
I pulled back and let the music back,

19:05.132 --> 19:07.706
I started to teach English and to be skating coach.

19:08.258 --> 19:09.878
Alicia!

19:10.181 --> 19:11.673
Come here!

19:11.808 --> 19:13.751
Being with Alicia was fabulous.

19:14.353 --> 19:17.147
During the duels, I was going home.

19:18.081 --> 19:19.683
We have two Robbery!

19:19.961 --> 19:22.232
To participate in the Team Adam

19:22.289 --> 19:24.356
It is a great blessing.

19:24.716 --> 19:27.165
I did not think I would have another chance in music.

19:27.280 --> 19:30.294
This may be the last. I have to give my best.

19:33.591 --> 19:36.715
For knockouts, chose "Respect" by Aretha Franklin.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.252
My genre is a little soul
with a bit of R & B.

19:40.444 --> 19:43.720
This song is about how a woman should be treated.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.679
I will stage the demand a little respect!

19:52.395 --> 19:53.924
- Great. - Thanks.

19:53.959 --> 19:56.969
Of course, do not need help with the beat and the rhythm.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.148
Not force much hoarseness.

19:59.644 --> 20:01.895
You have a great voice, you do not need to force it.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.790
I want you to take the intensity of growls

20:03.791 --> 20:06.881
- and put in full force. - It's all right.

20:06.916 --> 20:08.216
When you do...

20:09.470 --> 20:11.185
Try not to make those curves, as in ...

20:16.804 --> 20:19.651
Bring it on. You Aretha now.

20:21.665 --> 20:23.276
This song is difficult. It Aretha,

20:23.311 --> 20:24.837
and is his most famous song.

20:24.872 --> 20:28.105
But his work ethic is strong, then it can go well.

20:29.617 --> 20:31.530
One of the things that makes me more nervous

20:31.565 --> 20:32.879
singing against Autumn

20:32.914 --> 20:35.289
is the stage presence she has to perform.

20:35.290 --> 20:36.839
She is amazing,

20:36.874 --> 20:38.778
and I really need to do my best.

20:39.139 --> 20:40.466
Much better!

20:41.456 --> 20:43.116
The part of the growl was perfect.

20:43.151 --> 20:44.712
I like the way the set.

20:45.047 --> 20:47.573
- Next victim! - It's all right.

20:49.418 --> 20:51.615
How will I compete with Aretha Franklin?

20:51.616 --> 20:53.809
Well, you will not. You will do your part

20:53.844 --> 20:55.740
and let me handle the competition.

20:55.775 --> 20:58.280
Knockout win that would be so amazing.

20:58.315 --> 21:00.374
I frequent the school of Arts in Orange County,

21:00.409 --> 21:04.190
but this is one of the greatest things I've ever done.

21:06.472 --> 21:09.609
I could barely follow singing when Adam turned.

21:09.644 --> 21:12.358
You kind of forgot he was singing.

21:12.752 --> 21:14.145
And in the end, I thought

21:14.345 --> 21:16.958
It was your best moment in the entire presentation.

21:16.993 --> 21:19.747
- Hanna Eyre! - During this experience,

21:19.782 --> 21:21.366
Adam was there with me,

21:21.401 --> 21:24.929
and I feel more confident in each presentation.

21:26.992 --> 21:29.317
I chose "Bleeding Love" by Leona Lewis.

21:29.352 --> 21:31.717
I see myself as an R & B artist and pop.

21:31.732 --> 21:33.603
This music will work just fine for me,

21:33.604 --> 21:36.575
because it is different than it sang here in the program.

21:36.610 --> 21:38.840
It's emotional. It is more intense.

21:39.740 --> 21:42.598
I've already beat Aretha Franklin to advance.

21:43.379 --> 21:46.643
So I need just to make sure I'm doing everything.

21:51.532 --> 21:53.706
Cero, you are a very talented person ...

21:53.741 --> 21:55.361
and this is a very simple song.

21:55.362 --> 21:57.452
Make sure it looks good. Save some air.

21:57.453 --> 21:59.019
You do not want to embellish too much,

21:59.054 --> 22:00.565
because you lose some people.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.126
Formulate a good plan for what you want.

22:08.466 --> 22:11.465
When I heard her sing, I thrilled me.

22:12.849 --> 22:14.720
I cringed whole.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.415
It was almost, "Go Hanna!"

22:16.450 --> 22:18.247
I need to improve my game plan.

22:18.248 --> 22:20.876
It has to do with the rhythm.

22:24.939 --> 22:27.751
And those 3 huge notes, I want to go

22:27.786 --> 22:30.001
but try to be in your mind tuned.

22:30.036 --> 22:33.331
You have a big voice, but it's a bit out of tune.

22:36.110 --> 22:38.285
Hanna has a lot of potential. If it continues like this

22:38.286 --> 22:40.560
and keep improving, the sky is the limit.

22:40.595 --> 22:41.897
You two are so good.

22:41.932 --> 22:43.949
- Thanks! - Very good. Hug group.

22:43.984 --> 22:46.202
I do not know who will choose. Both have much to offer.

22:46.203 --> 22:48.183
I think it will be a great knockout.

22:50.626 --> 22:53.607
Com "Respect",
Autumn Turner.

23:00.436 --> 23:02.199
What you want

23:02.234 --> 23:04.234
Baby, I got it

23:04.426 --> 23:06.335
What you need

23:06.370 --> 23:08.212
You know I got it

23:08.390 --> 23:10.451
And all I'm askin'

23:10.676 --> 23:13.250
Is for a little respect
when you come home

23:13.285 --> 23:14.903
Hey, baby

23:14.904 --> 23:16.683
When you get home

23:17.572 --> 23:18.986
Mister

23:20.690 --> 23:24.092
I ain't gonna do you wrong,
while you're gone

23:24.773 --> 23:28.408
I ain't gonna do you wrong,
'cause I don't wanna

23:28.894 --> 23:30.857
And all I'm askin'

23:31.034 --> 23:33.676
Is for a little respect
when you come home

23:33.711 --> 23:35.443
Baby

23:35.478 --> 23:37.179
When you get home

23:40.910 --> 23:42.601
I'm about to give ya

23:43.258 --> 23:44.912
All my money

23:45.368 --> 23:48.865
And all I'm askin'
in return, honey

23:49.433 --> 23:50.763
Is to give me

23:50.960 --> 23:55.893
Won't you give me my propers
when you get home?

23:55.928 --> 23:58.219
When you get home

24:01.785 --> 24:03.488
Your kisses

24:03.523 --> 24:05.153
Sweeter than honey

24:05.811 --> 24:09.366
But guess what
So is my money

24:09.960 --> 24:12.543
And all I want you to do for me

24:12.578 --> 24:14.896
Is give it to me
when you get home

24:14.931 --> 24:16.368
Hey, baby

24:16.403 --> 24:18.197

24:21.555 --> 24:23.476
R-E-S-P-E-C-T

24:23.511 --> 24:25.598
Find out what it means to me

24:25.633 --> 24:27.836
R-E-S-P-E-C-T

24:27.871 --> 24:30.148
Take care, TCB

24:40.706 --> 24:44.050
- So amazing! - Drop all, girl!

24:45.160 --> 24:47.160
@GrupoSubVoice

24:47.161 --> 24:50.500
GrupoSubVoice.wordpress.com fb.com/GrupoSubVoice

24:50.766 --> 24:52.138
We are back!

24:56.592 --> 25:00.375
Agora, cantando "Bleeding Love",
Hanna Eyre.

25:07.670 --> 25:09.825
Closed off from love

25:09.860 --> 25:12.314
I didn't need the pain

25:12.349 --> 25:14.491
Once or twice was enough

25:14.526 --> 25:16.903
And it was all in vain

25:16.938 --> 25:19.014
Time starts to pass

25:19.049 --> 25:22.430
Before you know it you're frozen

25:26.039 --> 25:28.506
But I don't care what they say

25:28.541 --> 25:30.541
I'm in love with you

25:30.576 --> 25:32.866
They try to pull me away

25:32.901 --> 25:35.181
But they don't know the truth

25:35.216 --> 25:41.172
My heart's crippled by the vein
that I keep on closing

25:41.207 --> 25:44.625
You cut me open, and I

25:44.660 --> 25:46.173
Keep bleeding

25:46.208 --> 25:49.000
Keep, keep bleeding love

25:49.035 --> 25:50.695
I keep bleeding

25:50.730 --> 25:53.633
Keep, keep bleeding love

25:53.668 --> 25:55.313
I keep bleeding

25:55.601 --> 26:00.232
Keep, keep bleeding love

26:00.505 --> 26:03.138
You cut me open

26:03.173 --> 26:05.448
I don't care what they say

26:05.483 --> 26:07.547
I'm in love with you

26:07.582 --> 26:09.821
They try to pull me away

26:09.856 --> 26:12.112
But they don't know the truth

26:12.147 --> 26:17.934
My heart's crippled by the vein
I keep on closing

26:20.266 --> 26:28.558
And I

26:36.903 --> 26:39.919
You cut me open

26:39.954 --> 26:41.806
I keep bleeding

26:42.058 --> 26:45.641
Keep, keep bleeding

26:45.813 --> 26:50.971
Love

26:52.578 --> 26:55.006
- So good! - Applause for Autumn and Hanna!

26:58.750 --> 27:01.281
- Blake? - It's so shocking

27:01.316 --> 27:03.259
when Hanna, that little girl standing there,

27:03.294 --> 27:05.653
suddenly starts singing and you think, "Wow!"

27:05.688 --> 27:07.351
It looked like a Transformer .

27:07.767 --> 27:10.539
You have so much control of his voice.

27:10.826 --> 27:12.592
You have an incredible reach.

27:12.751 --> 27:14.951
Autumn, you did an amazing job

27:14.986 --> 27:18.844
with music that is considered somewhat untouchable.

27:18.879 --> 27:20.781
- It was risky for you ... - Yeah.

27:20.782 --> 27:22.082
But very talented.

27:22.109 --> 27:23.983
I would probably go with Hanna.

27:25.700 --> 27:28.468
Autumn, I really loved the bass in his voice.

27:28.503 --> 27:30.409
Before I think I felt more beauty,

27:30.444 --> 27:32.502
and today I heard over the strength of her voice,

27:32.537 --> 27:33.942
- and I loved it. - Thanks.

27:33.977 --> 27:36.830
And Hanna has been an exponential growth

27:36.865 --> 27:40.095
even after these few presentations.

27:40.130 --> 27:42.141
You have such a beautiful voice.

27:42.142 --> 27:43.913
It's not an easy song to sing.

27:43.948 --> 27:45.850
You two were super brave,

27:45.885 --> 27:49.374
and showed beautifully who you are.

27:49.409 --> 27:51.678
Thank you, mentor. Gwen, your comments?

27:51.713 --> 27:53.138
So, Hanna,

27:53.173 --> 27:56.118
this was his presentation that I liked to hear.

27:56.153 --> 27:57.519
- It was so good. - Thank you.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.347
His voice is so intense and rich,

27:59.382 --> 28:01.623
and you have much control over it.

28:01.658 --> 28:03.796
And, Autumn, I wanted you so much in my team.

28:03.831 --> 28:05.960
I think there's something really magical about you.

28:05.961 --> 28:08.006
I was somewhat disappointed with the choice of music.

28:08.007 --> 28:10.771
I wanted to hear the kind of album you want to do.

28:10.806 --> 28:13.461
I'd love to hear you sing "Bleeding Love".

28:13.496 --> 28:15.595
I probably would choose to Hanna,

28:15.630 --> 28:18.029
because it was unbelievable.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.567
Adam, everything depends on you.

28:20.602 --> 28:22.134
I'm proud of both

28:22.137 --> 28:24.608
manage to do what we agreed in the assay.

28:24.611 --> 28:26.857
Hanna, you have only 15 years, and repeat it,

28:26.859 --> 28:28.876
it is incredible that with only 15 years

28:28.911 --> 28:31.746
you come here and do it all. And Autumn, you was accurate.

28:31.749 --> 28:34.334
This chorus is unique. They make us wait 20 minutes

28:34.338 --> 28:37.788
before the chorus happen. And Aretha was a bold choice.

28:40.470 --> 28:43.161
difficult decision, Adam. Who won the knockout?

28:47.199 --> 28:50.059
Well, I will make my decision based on what I think

28:50.169 --> 28:53.035
I would feel most lacking to go away.

28:54.413 --> 28:55.716
The winner...

28:56.707 --> 28:58.357
This knockout ...

28:59.484 --> 29:01.461
- Is Hanna! - My God!

29:01.463 --> 29:03.880
Hanna, congratulations! You advance to

29:03.883 --> 29:06.184
- Thanks! - the live Classifiers.

29:06.829 --> 29:11.242
Hanna chose because she is young and has a lot of potential.

29:11.249 --> 29:14.408
Keep an eye, it will continue improving and surprising.

29:14.424 --> 29:15.930
You are amazing!

29:15.973 --> 29:20.630
Having Adam Levine believing in me is all! I wanna cry!

29:20.876 --> 29:23.807
- It was amazing! I'm proud! - My God!

29:23.810 --> 29:26.807
- I can not believe! - You were great!

29:26.987 --> 29:30.093
- Autumn, to say something? - Adam, thanks for

29:30.097 --> 29:34.964
believe me twice. I am sad to leave, of course,

29:35.668 --> 29:38.746
but very happy to have had this experience.

29:38.805 --> 29:41.174
Autumn Turner palms, people!

29:45.071 --> 29:47.798
These were the most disputed knockouts in history!

29:47.800 --> 29:50.872
Autumn is very talented! I want it to continue

29:50.877 --> 29:52.741
in music and follow your heart.

29:53.781 --> 29:57.306
Wow, Hanna is very good! My God!

29:57.540 --> 29:58.842
To follow...

30:00.407 --> 30:02.167
Most amazing knockouts ...

30:06.327 --> 30:08.351
They make our mentors emocionarem.

30:08.803 --> 30:11.682
You chose a song that I listen to dating.

30:11.685 --> 30:13.863
- Yuck! - That cute, Gwen!

30:13.864 --> 30:15.223
So I know the song.

30:16.086 --> 30:18.286
Group Sub Voice features ...

30:18.287 --> 30:21.500
Butchers making the best rolls!

30:21.670 --> 30:23.423
Welcome back to the knockouts.

30:32.735 --> 30:34.924
Alicia, her hair is preventing me and Gwen

30:34.927 --> 30:39.428
to exchange glances. You are tying our love.

30:40.496 --> 30:43.013
And now? It got better?

30:44.051 --> 30:46.046
Now let's see Gwen Team!

30:46.887 --> 30:48.968
- Hi people! - What's up?

30:49.061 --> 30:51.509
My freshman and my veteran.

30:51.552 --> 30:54.577
- They want to know why the two? - Must be tights.

30:54.581 --> 30:56.634
- Perhaps the tights ... - Or the boots.

30:56.637 --> 30:58.595
Down here makes a lot of sense.

30:59.395 --> 31:02.848
I chose Hunter and Johnny as they both sing

31:02.851 --> 31:06.043
alternative rock, and it seemed obvious join them.

31:06.201 --> 31:08.901
Here was my first time singing outside the church.

31:09.220 --> 31:11.279
Before the hearings, had married me,

31:11.352 --> 31:14.241
and it was the happiest of all days. Then a flood hit

31:14.246 --> 31:18.122
Louisiana and we lost our home. Two months later,

31:18.126 --> 31:20.708
I was already on the stage of The Voice singing.

31:27.692 --> 31:30.169
I'm new on Team Gwen because she stole.

31:30.199 --> 31:32.580
Hunter, you touch me a lot when singing.

31:32.584 --> 31:34.198
- Thank you. - It's amazing!

31:34.283 --> 31:38.820
I got here, and I want to stay with Gwen to the live stage.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.845
In knockouts, I chose "I Want To Know What Love Is"

31:48.848 --> 31:50.954
Foreigner. My father attended a

31:50.957 --> 31:52.901
gospel rock band in the 80s and 90s,

31:52.904 --> 31:55.317
called Brother. Many of their songs

31:55.320 --> 31:57.902
They looked like Foreigner. It has to do with this song.

32:00.598 --> 32:03.043
Hunter is a great singer. It has a differential

32:03.047 --> 32:05.228
in his voice, which is amazing. I'm nervous

32:05.231 --> 32:07.096
having to face someone like him.

32:09.339 --> 32:11.640
It was great! I think at times,

32:11.644 --> 32:15.741
when you hold the elongated notes, is half stuck,

32:15.744 --> 32:18.397
because you're forcing. Use your abs to force,

32:18.400 --> 32:20.921
not your voice, you know? Seriously, it's too much effort.

32:21.071 --> 32:25.384
If you can relax a little, still be able to get the note.

32:25.408 --> 32:28.425
It helps a lot when you decide not force either.

32:35.164 --> 32:38.005
Something I hate is when stir in classics,

32:38.007 --> 32:41.384
but here it was really cool. He incorporated the personality.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.738
- You are changing a little - Yes.

32:44.741 --> 32:47.810
the rhythm of the melody. But I think it updated the music.

32:47.889 --> 32:49.657
- Well, thank you. - Hello!

32:50.213 --> 32:53.129
- Hunter, you rocked! - Johnny, want to sing now?

32:53.132 --> 32:56.080
- Of course, it's for now! - Come on, Johnny! Ever took!

32:57.241 --> 33:01.119
I've been a band for 13 years. It is my first time as

33:01.122 --> 33:03.233
a solo singer, here in The Voice.

33:06.559 --> 33:10.676
My God! Goodbye to you!

33:10.712 --> 33:13.502
Team Gwen, Johnny Gates!

33:16.682 --> 33:19.124
I feel and Gwen have a special connection.

33:19.128 --> 33:22.381
Our families are Italian, we both come from bands

33:22.431 --> 33:25.078
and she has a solo career. All this together makes

33:25.082 --> 33:28.702
perfeira the mentor to me. I want to give the best of me,

33:28.706 --> 33:32.302
to let Gwen proud to have given me a chance.

33:32.324 --> 33:35.842
- I want to know your music. - I really want to sing

33:35.873 --> 33:39.353
"Million Reasons", Lady Gaga, for corner 13 years ago,

33:39.357 --> 33:41.576
and I have had many reasons to give up.

33:41.579 --> 33:43.752
And for not giving up until I got here.

33:43.757 --> 33:45.109
- Certainly. - Yes.

33:45.112 --> 33:47.648
- So come on, Johnny Gates. - Let's start.

33:49.538 --> 33:53.343
This time will be no guitar. Just me singing.

33:53.349 --> 33:56.435
Of course I'm nervous. It's something new for me.

33:59.850 --> 34:04.687
Seeing Johnny dropped my file that will be hotly contested.

34:04.898 --> 34:06.969
That was cool! The power you have,

34:06.973 --> 34:09.505
to sing long notes ... It's amazing!

34:09.681 --> 34:12.141
- I noticed something on you ... - What?

34:12.145 --> 34:16.542
When you arrive in the highest parts, you do not express

34:16.547 --> 34:21.726
in your face what you are singing.

34:21.730 --> 34:23.850
- Got it. - It's like you sing,

34:23.853 --> 34:25.498
- Yes. - But do not feel the music.

34:25.502 --> 34:28.344
- If you connect with the letter! - Yes, I understood.

34:32.659 --> 34:34.907
Johnny has a good sense of music.

34:34.909 --> 34:36.996
And Hunter is a creative guy.

34:39.219 --> 34:42.759
Both are talented and have many chances to advance.

34:43.917 --> 34:47.594
Cantando "I Want To Know
What Love Is", Hunter Plake.

34:55.867 --> 34:59.743
I gotta take a little time

35:00.942 --> 35:06.001
A little time
to think things over

35:07.952 --> 35:12.757
I better read
between the lines

35:12.792 --> 35:17.417
In case I need it
when I'm older

35:17.841 --> 35:21.013
In my life

35:21.263 --> 35:24.763
There's been heartache and pain

35:24.798 --> 35:27.573
I don't know

35:27.608 --> 35:31.778
If I can face it again

35:31.813 --> 35:34.939
I can't stop now

35:35.745 --> 35:39.005
I've traveled too far

35:39.177 --> 35:44.939
To change this lonely life

35:47.300 --> 35:52.441
I want to know what love is

35:54.636 --> 35:58.608
I want you to show me

36:01.100 --> 36:06.166
I want to feel what love is

36:08.278 --> 36:13.600
I want you to show me

36:21.547 --> 36:27.294
I want you to show me

36:35.687 --> 36:41.234
I want you to show me

36:42.430 --> 36:46.661
I want you to show me

37:08.899 --> 37:12.031
We came back with the 1st night of knockouts.

37:15.154 --> 37:18.380
Agora, com "Million Reasons",
Johnny Gates.

37:25.922 --> 37:29.803
You're giving me a million
reasons to let you go

37:29.838 --> 37:33.316
Giving me a million
reasons to quit the show

37:33.351 --> 37:35.659
Givin' me a million reasons

37:35.660 --> 37:39.545
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons

37:39.546 --> 37:40.912
About a million reasons

37:40.947 --> 37:44.252
If I had a highway,
I would run for the hills

37:44.287 --> 37:47.741
If you could find a dry way,
I'd forever be still

37:47.882 --> 37:50.177
But you're giving me
a million reasons

37:50.212 --> 37:51.845
Give me a million reasons

37:51.846 --> 37:54.460
Givin' me a million reasons

37:55.241 --> 37:59.687
I bow down to pray

37:59.722 --> 38:02.687
I try to make the worst
seem better

38:02.722 --> 38:06.865
Lord, show me the way

38:06.900 --> 38:10.180
To cut through
all this worn-out leather

38:10.335 --> 38:16.877
I've got a hundred million
reasons to walk away

38:17.058 --> 38:24.811
But, baby, I just need
one good one to stay

38:24.846 --> 38:28.120
Can't you give me
what I'm needin', needin'?

38:28.155 --> 38:34.494
Every heartbreak makes it hard
to keep the faith

38:35.207 --> 38:38.034
But, baby,
I just need one good one

38:38.035 --> 38:41.819
Good one, good one,
good one, good one

38:42.480 --> 38:46.814
When I bow down to pray

38:46.983 --> 38:49.880
I try to make the worst
seem better

38:49.915 --> 38:54.048
Lord, show me the way

38:54.083 --> 38:57.425
To cut through
all this worn-out leather

38:57.614 --> 39:04.157
I've got a hundred million
reasons to walk away

39:04.323 --> 39:08.617
But, baby,
I just need one good one

39:10.011 --> 39:13.066
To stay

39:16.844 --> 39:21.327
Applause for Hunter and Johnny in a Knockout Team Gwen.

39:21.481 --> 39:22.877
What I'll do?

39:24.558 --> 39:26.483
Friends, good work from you.

39:26.518 --> 39:28.267
Adam Levine, his comments.

39:28.302 --> 39:30.625
Hunter, my ear just met you,

39:30.660 --> 39:33.151
I tried to catch him in duels.

39:33.186 --> 39:35.088
I'm not so cool as Gwen, so ...

39:35.123 --> 39:38.800
- Truth. - Nobody asked you, okay?

39:39.528 --> 39:41.075
You are so different. Johnny,

39:41.110 --> 39:44.529
you are already an accomplished artist. It's a great artist.

39:44.564 --> 39:47.569
But Hunter, you hit something that is a little deeper.

39:47.604 --> 39:50.565
I was amazed at the level of thought,

39:50.600 --> 39:53.111
creativity and art in what you just did ...

39:53.146 --> 39:56.217
And I reward it with you being the winner of the knockout.

39:56.252 --> 39:59.329
Thank you, mentor. Blake, wants to help Gwen?

40:00.371 --> 40:03.032
It's always fun to see a presentation of Johnny.

40:03.046 --> 40:05.185
He has stage presence.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.674
And Hunter, being the new guy on the team,

40:07.709 --> 40:10.583
sometimes puts you in a difficult situation, but ours!

40:11.128 --> 40:14.112
The man sang a song that everyone knows.

40:14.294 --> 40:15.800
Even I know this song.

40:15.801 --> 40:17.852
- Do you believe that, Alicia? - I believe.

40:17.853 --> 40:19.153
I Do not.

40:19.254 --> 40:22.824
He honored the original, but still has his music.

40:22.859 --> 40:26.076
You are a new species which we have not seen here.

40:26.077 --> 40:27.671
And that's a good guy thing.

40:27.706 --> 40:31.183
I would say that Hunter won the knockout, if it was me.

40:31.615 --> 40:32.915
Thank you, mentor.

40:32.916 --> 40:34.650
Hunter his former mentor, Alicia.

40:34.685 --> 40:37.768
Good job, Hunter. I was encouraged to see the piano.

40:37.803 --> 40:40.118
The intimacy that you create in that space

40:40.119 --> 40:41.645
It is not an easy thing to do.

40:41.772 --> 40:45.143
And Johnny, the way he jumps and dance across the stage,

40:45.178 --> 40:47.571
remember the way you jump and dance around the stage.

40:47.606 --> 40:51.779
And I like this. Always I found the like of it.

40:51.814 --> 40:53.598
I think it's an Italian thing.

40:53.599 --> 40:55.331
He is the male version.

40:55.366 --> 40:58.122
You have a strong vocal ability.

40:58.157 --> 41:00.872
I thought it was a great choice of song for you.

41:01.115 --> 41:03.839
So for me, the winner would be Johnny.

41:05.892 --> 41:07.878
Gwen, the decision is yours. Tell what you think.

41:07.912 --> 41:10.923
It has something positive about you, Johnny.

41:10.958 --> 41:12.815
See you at the moment, which is

41:12.850 --> 41:15.531
this trading platform, which is different

41:15.566 --> 41:18.103
everything you've done, and you deal with it so well.

41:18.138 --> 41:22.523
And today you have prepared and did a great job.

41:22.524 --> 41:23.824
Very good.

41:23.825 --> 41:25.756
But what makes it so difficult is that,

41:25.791 --> 41:28.619
Hunter, I think I got to know you very quickly

41:28.654 --> 41:30.203
in a short time.

41:30.238 --> 41:34.038
And this is the first stage in which it is presented outside the Church.

41:34.039 --> 41:35.339
It's unbelievable.

41:35.340 --> 41:36.640
You got a song

41:36.641 --> 41:38.756
It is on my list of dating.

41:39.708 --> 41:41.008
Eca!

41:42.155 --> 41:43.455
How cute, Gwen.

41:43.456 --> 41:45.018
I said I knew the music.

41:47.950 --> 41:51.012
Seriously, do what he did with the music was very good.

41:51.047 --> 41:54.097
I have no idea what to do. Not even a little.

41:54.132 --> 41:56.612
Gwen, who won the knockout?

41:57.926 --> 41:59.817
I'm really shaking now.

42:00.216 --> 42:01.522
I know.

42:04.215 --> 42:05.533
Road.

42:09.263 --> 42:13.800
Needless to say, the winner of this knockout ...

42:14.944 --> 42:16.258
will be or Hunter.

42:17.021 --> 42:18.701
Congratulations!

42:18.736 --> 42:21.780
You go to Classifiers Live!

42:21.815 --> 42:23.565
Hunter!

42:24.245 --> 42:25.584
- Thank you - was very good.

42:25.619 --> 42:28.618
It was the craziest moment of my life.

42:28.653 --> 42:30.178
- Congratulations, man. - Thank you.

42:30.213 --> 42:32.795
Gwen heard something in me, and I feel very honored.

42:34.208 --> 42:36.388
I remember Johnny is available for theft.

42:36.389 --> 42:38.431
Johnny, you mean something to your mentor?

42:38.980 --> 42:41.710
I just want to thank you for giving me a chance.

42:41.720 --> 42:44.100
This experience has proven that no matter what

42:44.135 --> 42:47.727
happened today, I could continue in music.

42:48.179 --> 42:49.659
Ladies and gentlemen, applaud

42:49.660 --> 42:50.960
Johnny Gates.

42:52.090 --> 42:53.513
All are very good.

42:53.548 --> 42:56.503
Let someone go at this point is very difficult.

42:56.784 --> 42:58.656
Johnny has a great voice.

42:58.691 --> 43:01.634
But Hunter has creativity and it is hard to ignore.

43:01.686 --> 43:03.866
He deserved to win the Knockout.

43:03.901 --> 43:06.046
Damn, that's awful.

43:06.181 --> 43:08.669
The two are so good in their own way.

43:08.670 --> 43:10.445
- IT IS. - This is sad.

43:11.368 --> 43:12.676
To follow...

43:16.025 --> 43:19.004
Some of the most amazing performances ever seen

43:23.005 --> 43:25.257
Knockouts lead to new heights.

43:25.403 --> 43:27.235
Bruce Lee appeared.

43:27.665 --> 43:30.591
I cringed.

43:30.626 --> 43:32.534
This is very, very challenging.

43:32.569 --> 43:34.384
Sorry, I'm being honest.

43:35.066 --> 43:37.147
This is a theft!

43:42.940 --> 43:44.249
We are back.

43:46.010 --> 43:47.736
Welcome to the good team.

43:47.737 --> 43:49.037
Thank you for having me.

43:49.038 --> 43:50.667
The other three are the villains.

43:50.668 --> 43:51.968
We're the good guys.

43:52.140 --> 43:53.442
This will be ...

43:53.443 --> 43:54.743
I'm not happy about it.

43:54.744 --> 43:57.781
- Believe me, I also am not. - We lived together!

43:57.823 --> 43:59.123
- Oh really? - Yes!

43:59.135 --> 44:00.991
Cruel, Blake.
Cruel.

44:01.777 --> 44:04.508
Joined Casi and Felicia because even though

44:04.543 --> 44:06.738
one country and pop ,

44:06.773 --> 44:09.876
both are powerful singers in my team.

44:09.920 --> 44:11.284
What will you sing?

44:11.319 --> 44:13.071
"My Church", de Maren Morris.

44:13.106 --> 44:15.068
Love this song. Will play too?

44:15.069 --> 44:16.869
I'll try. Unless you do not like.

44:16.870 --> 44:18.170
I think I'll love it.

44:18.270 --> 44:21.432
It's great to be able to sing a song country Current

44:21.467 --> 44:24.259
and show all the different tones of my voice.

44:25.715 --> 44:27.441
When I was 17,

44:27.476 --> 44:30.857
I formed a rock band and we played on the Warped Tour.

44:30.892 --> 44:33.929
I think that's how I learned to introduce myself.

44:33.964 --> 44:36.513
But I found I need to be with the country .

44:41.752 --> 44:46.913
A long time ago I want to shout: "I'm on Team Blake."

44:47.433 --> 44:48.783
That!

44:48.784 --> 44:50.084
Almost Joy!

44:50.651 --> 44:53.324
Being in this huge stage ...

44:53.359 --> 44:55.228
The winner of the duel is the Casi.

44:56.405 --> 45:01.354
It is surreal to finally have arrived

45:01.389 --> 45:04.714
where I try since I was five years.

45:09.723 --> 45:11.433
I love the choice of Casi

45:11.468 --> 45:14.116
because it gives her the chance to consolidate the fact

45:14.151 --> 45:18.115
that it is a bolder version of an artist country .

45:20.232 --> 45:21.547
Casi is amazing.

45:21.617 --> 45:24.470
She sings and he shakes his head, like, "That's it."

45:26.958 --> 45:29.751
So I have to give my best.

45:32.462 --> 45:33.825
She's good, Felicia.

45:33.912 --> 45:35.213
You are professional

45:35.214 --> 45:36.850
how to cause heart attack.

45:38.284 --> 45:40.923
When you use the yodeling, it is because you

45:40.958 --> 45:43.168
You think you can not reach the note?

45:43.203 --> 45:45.788
I did this because I used to play four hours a day

45:45.823 --> 45:48.308
and I thought, "I will not reach the note is not necessary"

45:48.309 --> 45:49.609
Well, that part ...

45:51.559 --> 45:52.861
- Is a building. - Yes.

45:52.896 --> 45:55.363
When you break this energy, it withered.

45:55.872 --> 45:57.888
If you get hit with full voice,

45:57.889 --> 45:59.985
It would be more powerful that way.

45:59.986 --> 46:01.848
As a singer, you learn tricks

46:01.883 --> 46:03.816
as not reach high notes and destroy

46:03.851 --> 46:06.518
his voice for the night, or worse, by the week.

46:06.553 --> 46:08.392
Casi has some of these habits

46:08.393 --> 46:10.793
you need to lose while in the program.

46:10.794 --> 46:13.420
We can bring a bottle of whiskey or something?

46:13.421 --> 46:14.721
Drink plenty of water.

46:14.722 --> 46:16.923
The only time I drink water is when I sing.

46:16.924 --> 46:19.295
Maybe I should try some water these days.

46:19.737 --> 46:22.587
Agora podemos chamar a novata.

46:23.265 --> 46:25.085
I have much to learn here then,

46:25.086 --> 46:26.669
come and we start singing.

46:26.670 --> 46:29.507
Felicia stole because I thought she had a mountain

46:29.542 --> 46:32.384
impossible to climb against Quizz in Duel.

46:33.384 --> 46:36.187
I think she did an equally amazing job.

46:36.222 --> 46:39.240
I thought she still deserved a place in the program.

46:39.275 --> 46:40.638
The Frosty even spoke,

46:42.235 --> 46:44.499
there is no reason for her to win the program.

46:44.534 --> 46:47.201
I'm excited to start the journey with Team Blake.

46:47.236 --> 46:49.628
After all I've been through with cancer,

46:49.663 --> 46:53.284
receive this opportunity was my best gift.

46:55.485 --> 46:57.686
- O que vai cantar?
- "My Heart Will Go On"

46:57.687 --> 47:00.108
Cline Dion. "Titanic" I'll have my moment.

47:00.109 --> 47:01.409
Celine Dion?

47:01.410 --> 47:02.710
No pressure.

47:02.711 --> 47:05.616
She is one of the greatest singers since the beginning of time.

47:05.799 --> 47:07.369
It's a lot of responsibility.

47:07.404 --> 47:09.549
This song makes me think of my grandmother.

47:09.684 --> 47:10.999
She passed away.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.521
Funny that my grandmother was called Shirley Temple.

47:13.556 --> 47:16.917
She was a cabaret singer and loved the great voices.

47:19.660 --> 47:23.059
So when I sing, I always want to be the high point

47:23.094 --> 47:24.935
because my grandmother was.

47:27.706 --> 47:31.220
Not only am I intimidated by singing against Felicia.

47:33.743 --> 47:36.011
If you perform this song perfectly,

47:36.046 --> 47:38.027
is kind, large microphone. Finished.

47:38.062 --> 47:39.362
That was amazing.

47:39.363 --> 47:41.895
I'm here crying, singing along, vibrating.

47:41.930 --> 47:45.102
There is much more in you and your ability

47:45.137 --> 47:46.695
than what we have seen so far.

47:46.696 --> 47:47.996
Was very good.

47:47.997 --> 47:51.314
But the moment they know you sing this song,

47:51.349 --> 47:53.876
and all these sequences in it,

47:53.911 --> 47:56.831
they will immediately wait for these moments.

47:56.866 --> 47:59.615
I felt that you lost a little energy.

47:59.650 --> 48:00.995
You need to keep your breath.

48:01.030 --> 48:03.838
When the note below, the vibrato is a bit ...

48:04.169 --> 48:05.578
I love the range of Felicia.

48:05.579 --> 48:06.879
I love his passion.

48:06.880 --> 48:09.464
If she can use these points and keep quiet,

48:09.465 --> 48:10.765
It will be hard to beat it.

48:10.766 --> 48:13.171
You make me nervous and my heart beats fast.

48:13.172 --> 48:14.472
Which is!

48:14.473 --> 48:16.230
It is the 1st time working with Blake

48:16.231 --> 48:18.423
and I feel like I'm hanging by a thread

48:18.458 --> 48:20.057
and I need to prove I'm good.

48:20.058 --> 48:21.426
It's bad for me.

48:22.204 --> 48:23.831
It's called Knockout for a reason.

48:23.866 --> 48:25.807
Then destroying the roof of that place.

48:25.842 --> 48:28.121
That's what you should do as singers.

48:29.547 --> 48:31.759
Cantando "My Church",
essa  Casi Joy.

48:34.039 --> 48:37.111
I've cussed on a Sunday

48:37.146 --> 48:40.118
I've cheated, and I've lied

48:40.153 --> 48:43.321
I've fallen down from grace

48:43.378 --> 48:46.194
A few too many times

48:46.229 --> 48:49.503
But I find holy redemption

48:49.538 --> 48:52.601
When I put this car in drive

48:52.636 --> 48:54.312
I roll the windows down

48:54.347 --> 48:58.228
And turn up the dial

48:58.263 --> 49:02.141
So, can I get a hallelujah?

49:03.001 --> 49:04.685
Can I get an amen?

49:04.720 --> 49:06.804
Feels like the Holy Ghost

49:06.839 --> 49:08.162
Running through ya

49:08.197 --> 49:11.357
When I play the highway FM

49:11.392 --> 49:14.692
I find my soul revival

49:14.727 --> 49:17.525
Singing every single word

49:17.966 --> 49:23.945
Yeah
I guess that's my church

49:23.980 --> 49:26.986
When Hank brings the sermon

49:27.570 --> 49:29.924
And Cash leads the choir

49:30.272 --> 49:33.234
It gets my cold
Cold heart burning

49:33.269 --> 49:36.300
Hotter than a ring of fire

49:36.356 --> 49:39.545
When this wonderful world
Gets heavy

49:39.580 --> 49:44.275
And I need to find my escape

49:44.310 --> 49:46.099
I keep the wheels rolling

49:46.134 --> 49:47.581
Radio scrolling

49:47.616 --> 49:49.836
Till my sins wash away

49:49.871 --> 49:54.213
Can I get a hallelujah?

49:54.248 --> 49:56.119
Can I get an amen?

49:56.154 --> 49:58.249
Feels like the Holy Ghost

49:58.284 --> 49:59.677
Running through ya

49:59.712 --> 50:02.821
When I play the highway FM

50:02.856 --> 50:06.118
I find my soul revival

50:06.153 --> 50:09.354
Singing every single verse

50:09.389 --> 50:15.074
Yeah
I guess that's my church

50:15.793 --> 50:20.998
Yeah
I guess that's my church

50:21.855 --> 50:30.501
Yeah
I guess that's my church

50:42.667 --> 50:44.426
We're back with the Knockouts.

50:45.606 --> 50:47.317
E agora,
com "My Heart Will Go On"

50:47.318 --> 50:49.227
this is Felicia Temple.

51:01.404 --> 51:05.996
Every night in my dreams

51:06.031 --> 51:11.267
I see you, I feel you

51:11.302 --> 51:20.179
That is how I know you go on

51:21.459 --> 51:25.371
Near, far

51:25.406 --> 51:29.617
Wherever you are

51:29.685 --> 51:35.099
I believe in my heart and

51:35.134 --> 51:39.433
My heart will go on

51:39.468 --> 51:44.275
And on

51:49.900 --> 51:54.197
You're here

51:54.232 --> 51:58.604
There's nothing I fear

51:58.787 --> 52:01.310
And I know

52:01.311 --> 52:09.203
That my heart will go on

52:09.414 --> 52:13.747
We'll stay

52:13.782 --> 52:18.127
Forever this way

52:18.162 --> 52:23.657
You are safe in my heart and

52:23.692 --> 52:27.967
My heart will go on

52:28.002 --> 52:32.449
And on

52:32.450 --> 52:36.467
And on

52:45.203 --> 52:48.556
Casi applaud and Felicia, folks!

52:50.933 --> 52:52.603
Why put them together?

52:52.604 --> 52:54.004
I know, right?

52:54.500 --> 52:57.308
Blake Shelton, you will have a difficult decision to follow.

52:57.457 --> 52:59.690
Let's start with Mrs. Alicia Keys.

53:00.044 --> 53:03.909
What was it that made him put you two together?

53:03.910 --> 53:05.210
Do not know.

53:05.211 --> 53:08.641
My team is so good that all double has this dynamic.

53:09.733 --> 53:13.484
Anyway, Casi, I thought I had much control

53:13.519 --> 53:15.638
from instructing the audience to clap

53:15.673 --> 53:19.153
to the note at the end which was very overwhelming.

53:19.188 --> 53:20.562
- Thanks. - Beautiful work.

53:20.597 --> 53:24.819
Felicia, I had goose bumps on the arm while singing.

53:24.854 --> 53:26.655
And it was Cline Dion. Like, our.

53:27.255 --> 53:28.555
I know.

53:28.646 --> 53:29.946
Gwen?

53:30.052 --> 53:32.916
Casi, I felt that you were like, "I'll be there and I know

53:32.951 --> 53:35.644
exactly what to do. And I know exactly how to do it "

53:35.679 --> 53:38.753
Everyone should learn from their confidence.

53:40.114 --> 53:41.821
Felicia, I was shocked because

53:41.856 --> 53:43.676
It is a well-known and great music.

53:43.711 --> 53:45.628
- IT IS. - I feared for you.

53:45.663 --> 53:47.977
But you were unbelievable today.

53:48.012 --> 53:49.719
I also cringed.

53:49.720 --> 53:51.454
My chin was down all the time.

53:51.455 --> 53:52.755
I was like, "Wow!"

53:52.756 --> 53:54.946
The two did an amazing job.

53:54.947 --> 53:56.347
Thank you, mentor. Adam.

53:56.867 --> 53:58.951
So Casi, I'm a big fan of yours.

53:58.986 --> 54:01.651
But Felicia, listen to the introduction of this song

54:01.686 --> 54:03.088
It is to hear her say,

54:03.123 --> 54:06.146
"Look, I'll climb Mount Everest. Pay attention."

54:06.147 --> 54:08.147
And you think, "No, she will not."

54:08.209 --> 54:10.761
But you could, and it was amazing.

54:11.075 --> 54:13.829
I probably still would choose the Casi.

54:14.069 --> 54:16.823
But the courage of the award goes to you today.

54:19.424 --> 54:21.061
I'll start with you, Felicia.

54:21.096 --> 54:24.328
This was an outstanding presentation for you.

54:24.363 --> 54:27.847
Every time I sing, it's amazing. It is the next level.

54:27.882 --> 54:29.716
And that's why you stole.

54:29.751 --> 54:32.821
And you proved now. Congratulations.

54:32.822 --> 54:34.122
Was very good.

54:34.423 --> 54:37.145
Casi, the notes you hit him with full voice,

54:37.180 --> 54:40.397
on the spot, full of confidence, and you keep doing it

54:40.398 --> 54:41.798
every time you go onstage.

54:41.799 --> 54:44.424
There's no stopping Casi Joy.

54:44.459 --> 54:47.124
Why I joined them two? Tell me.

54:47.125 --> 54:48.963
I wanted to be surprised at his idiocy

54:48.964 --> 54:50.464
but unfortunately I'm not.

54:51.492 --> 54:54.285
2003 called and they want the mohawk back.

54:54.937 --> 54:56.339
You need to go back there.

54:56.374 --> 54:57.798
Blake, this is difficult friend.

54:57.799 --> 54:59.099
Who won the knockout?

54:59.100 --> 55:00.400
I guess...

55:13.228 --> 55:15.643
The winner of this knockout is the Casi.

55:15.683 --> 55:18.149
Casi Joy advances to Classifiers Live,

55:18.185 --> 55:20.930
representing Team Blake.

55:21.717 --> 55:24.549
I am, frankly, enough to have gain surprise.

55:26.117 --> 55:28.920
But I am very excited about the live stages.

55:28.955 --> 55:30.842
I can not wait to call my mom.

55:30.960 --> 55:32.915
Felicia, to say something to your mentor?

55:33.342 --> 55:35.584
Thank you for stealing me.

55:35.585 --> 55:36.885
It was a great pleasure.

55:36.886 --> 55:40.328
By this time last year, I was in chemotherapy,

55:40.363 --> 55:43.964
and now, I am cancer free.

55:43.999 --> 55:50.098
This was the best experience of my entire life.

55:50.133 --> 55:53.280
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give it to Felicia Temple.

55:53.533 --> 55:56.530
These artists are all no match to match.

55:56.750 --> 55:59.060
Both of these girls gave their best,

55:59.077 --> 56:00.717
but Casi is the old.

56:00.878 --> 56:03.784
It has a youthful enthusiasm for their presentations.

56:03.940 --> 56:07.182
I'm already thinking about the music that it needs to move forward.

56:08.420 --> 56:10.135
Felicia did a great presentation,

56:10.136 --> 56:11.889
but I prefer the more Casi,

56:11.890 --> 56:14.452
it's kind of eccentric, but the best way.

56:14.453 --> 56:15.951
The Casi these is to keep an eye.

56:16.037 --> 56:18.836
I do not care what they say. This mohawk is funny!

56:27.300 --> 56:28.893
Never accept advice fashion

56:31.556 --> 56:34.690
and hair salt and pepper .

56:41.256 --> 56:42.815
We are back.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.407
You can not make fun of that sweater.

56:49.442 --> 56:52.262
I know you're trying, but there is nothing.

56:52.570 --> 56:53.971
Who has the winning team?

56:53.972 --> 56:56.086
I have the winning team right now.

56:56.121 --> 56:58.216
But I almost always have.

56:58.390 --> 57:00.446
So who do you think you have the 2nd best?

57:03.127 --> 57:05.985
Let's check the next match Adam Team.

57:06.733 --> 57:08.332
I pareei Johnny against Josh

57:08.335 --> 57:10.350
because they are my rock.

57:10.467 --> 57:12.800
I want to see who can outdo the other here.

57:13.890 --> 57:15.291
What song will sing, man?

57:15.292 --> 57:17.846
Vou cantar "Statesboro Blues"
dos Allman Brothers.

57:17.881 --> 57:19.862
The Allmans are the best.

57:19.863 --> 57:24.234
I play it with my band, so I thought I honor her.

57:24.269 --> 57:27.316
The name of my band is Johnny Hayes and Loveseats.

57:29.513 --> 57:31.018
It is a rock band and soul .

57:31.053 --> 57:33.941
We had been playing almost every weekend.

57:34.167 --> 57:36.202
Last year, I could not turn a chair,

57:36.203 --> 57:37.991
then I returned.

57:39.117 --> 57:41.083
I am very happy not to have given up.

57:41.118 --> 57:43.240
Just I wish my wife thought it was fine.

57:43.241 --> 57:46.512
- This is our music. - It is cute.

57:46.547 --> 57:49.217
- Johnny Hayes! - My wife encouraged me

57:49.218 --> 57:50.982
a continuar no The Voice.

57:51.083 --> 57:53.189
I want to give it all I can give.

57:58.207 --> 57:59.761
Johnny Hayes,
"Statesboro Blues"

58:00.091 --> 58:02.439
It has been on 11 all the time. This is hard.

58:02.474 --> 58:05.885
But he has this power and this charisma.

58:12.434 --> 58:13.734
Only one detail.

58:15.547 --> 58:17.293
I want to hear the "nerve".

58:17.328 --> 58:18.783
So breathe deeper.

58:23.550 --> 58:27.966
In music blues I tend to be lazy in the enunciation,

58:28.001 --> 58:29.805
so I need to do it right.

58:29.840 --> 58:32.531
Take the opportunity to use all the space you have.

58:32.532 --> 58:34.601
Use the four corners of the stage.

58:35.303 --> 58:37.256
Let's do one more time. Hold the note.

58:37.291 --> 58:40.055
I love it when risks and hits the note.

58:40.133 --> 58:42.168
This is how you sing blues !

58:46.115 --> 58:48.789
Compete with Johnny has been painful.

58:48.920 --> 58:52.360
It has a presence so strong.

58:52.568 --> 58:54.625
And he has done it longer than me.

58:54.660 --> 58:57.167
Hopefully, I can show that I am able to challenge.

58:59.450 --> 59:02.159
So ... The kid has a cool hair.

59:02.163 --> 59:03.686
I mean, look at this. It's like...

59:03.721 --> 59:05.237
- Insane. - It's amazing.

59:05.256 --> 59:07.256
As a child, I wanted to be a rockstar .

59:07.257 --> 59:09.591
And it will be a rockstar , have to have big hair.

59:11.347 --> 59:14.446
Before The Voice, I was living in Glendale, Arizona,

59:14.481 --> 59:16.082
playing in restaurants and bars.

59:16.117 --> 59:19.371
Being in a program like this being so young is incredible.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.320
Josh is a rocker nerd .

59:23.321 --> 59:25.272
I was a rocker nerd , I see Josh.

59:25.273 --> 59:27.513
I know who it is at its core.

59:27.514 --> 59:29.558
My favorite band of the 90's Soundgarden!

59:29.559 --> 59:31.147
"Superunkown" is the best CD ever!

59:31.182 --> 59:34.219
"Badmotorfinger"!
 f de "Screaming Life/Fopp"?

59:34.220 --> 59:36.442
We are in a record store, by chance ?!

59:36.865 --> 59:38.381
Josh West!

59:38.416 --> 59:40.770
Being in The Voice, I definitely grew up,

59:40.771 --> 59:42.894
I progressed and became a better artist.

59:46.319 --> 59:48.959
I chose "Carry On Wayward Son", Kansas.

59:48.994 --> 59:51.906
This is the first real rock music I caught.

01:00:06.882 --> 01:00:08.758
This is so radical!

01:00:08.793 --> 01:00:11.446
are not happy this is happening here?

01:00:11.918 --> 01:00:14.177
Break it all! I love watching him perform,

01:00:14.212 --> 01:00:16.646
but I do not want to be in 11 all the time.

01:00:16.681 --> 01:00:19.039
The voice of Josh is quite sharp.

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:24.008
It has that whole rock Kansas, Boston, 70.

01:00:24.043 --> 01:00:25.931
The guy has power and charisma,

01:00:25.966 --> 01:00:29.275
but I think it's important pro Josh going to grow up to 11.

01:00:31.458 --> 01:00:32.850
I am grateful to Adam.

01:00:32.885 --> 01:00:36.420
He always has tips that take the song to another level,

01:00:36.455 --> 01:00:38.016
and I want to prove to him

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:39.600
I should stay in your team.

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:43.430
Josh is a rocker.

01:00:43.465 --> 01:00:46.745
Man, I did not sing like him when I was 18.

01:00:48.115 --> 01:00:50.079
I need to make sure I can handle it.

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:52.292
I can not wait to see what happens.

01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:55.744
Both of these guys keep surprising me

01:00:55.895 --> 01:00:58.892
and impressing me. This knockout will be very difficult.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.994
Decision super hard.

01:01:04.769 --> 01:01:07.161
Sim, Johnny e Josh!

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:08.705
Johnny e Josh!

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.385
Battle of the vibrations.

01:01:12.354 --> 01:01:16.272
Com "Statesboro Blues",
Johnny Hayes.

01:01:27.489 --> 01:01:29.138
Wake up, Mama

01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:31.844
Turn your lamp down low

01:01:35.344 --> 01:01:37.271
Wake up, Mama

01:01:37.306 --> 01:01:40.259
Turn your lamp down low

01:01:40.984 --> 01:01:45.005
You know,
I say you got no nerve, baby

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.878
To turn Uncle Johnny
from you door

01:01:49.819 --> 01:01:52.039
Oh, well,
I woke up this morning

01:01:52.074 --> 01:01:56.014
Yeah, I had
them Statesboro Blues

01:01:56.194 --> 01:01:57.494
Come on.

01:01:57.645 --> 01:02:00.556
I said I woke up
this morning, baby

01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:03.569
Had them Statesboro Blues

01:02:03.572 --> 01:02:04.872
You know

01:02:05.379 --> 01:02:07.993
And I looked over
in the corner, baby

01:02:08.285 --> 01:02:11.859
Grandpa seemed to have
them too, you know

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.424
I said my mama died
and left me

01:02:15.459 --> 01:02:17.385
My papa died and left me

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.096
I ain't good-looking, baby

01:02:19.287 --> 01:02:23.089
Want someone sweet and kind
I'm goin' to the country

01:02:23.313 --> 01:02:28.769
Baby, do you want to go?

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:31.152
If you can't make it, baby

01:02:31.316 --> 01:02:34.162
Your sister Lucille
said she wanna go

01:02:34.961 --> 01:02:36.688
And I'm sure gonna take her
- Vamos l.

01:02:37.209 --> 01:02:39.233
Wake up, Mama

01:02:39.268 --> 01:02:44.453
Turn your lamp down low

01:02:44.488 --> 01:02:46.481
Oh, wake up, Mama

01:02:47.006 --> 01:02:49.874
Turn your lamp down low

01:02:49.909 --> 01:02:51.356
Come on guys.

01:02:51.732 --> 01:02:54.669
I see you got no nerve, baby

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:58.144
To turn Uncle Johnny
from your door, you know

01:02:59.382 --> 01:03:03.694
I see you got no nerve, baby

01:03:04.786 --> 01:03:12.196
To turn Uncle Johnny
from your door

01:03:27.567 --> 01:03:29.107
We are back.

01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:34.043
E agora, Josh West
com "Carry On Wayward Son".

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.859
Carry on, my wayward son

01:03:42.059 --> 01:03:45.228
There'll be peace
when you are done

01:03:45.847 --> 01:03:49.443
Lay your weary head to rest

01:03:49.614 --> 01:03:52.325
Don't you cry no more

01:04:02.911 --> 01:04:06.535
Once I rose above the noise
and confusion

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.479
Just to get a glimpse
beyond this illusion

01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:13.750
I was soaring ever higher

01:04:14.379 --> 01:04:17.186
But I flew too high

01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:21.870
Though my eyes could see
I still was a blind man

01:04:22.009 --> 01:04:25.549
Though my mind could think
I still was a mad man

01:04:25.584 --> 01:04:29.006
I hear the voices
when I'm dreaming

01:04:29.391 --> 01:04:33.125
But I can hear them say

01:04:33.542 --> 01:04:36.930
Carry on, my wayward son

01:04:36.965 --> 01:04:40.410
There'll be peace
when you are done

01:04:41.153 --> 01:04:44.614
Lay your weary head to rest

01:04:44.906 --> 01:04:47.718
Don't you cry no more
No!

01:04:53.245 --> 01:04:57.114
Carry on
You will always remember

01:04:57.295 --> 01:05:00.903
Carry on
Nothing equals the splendor

01:05:01.169 --> 01:05:04.269
Now your life's no longer empty

01:05:04.832 --> 01:05:08.015
Surely heaven waits for you

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:12.221
Carry on, my wayward son

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:15.480
There'll be peace
when you are done

01:05:16.229 --> 01:05:19.879
Lay your weary head to rest

01:05:21.057 --> 01:05:27.057
Don't you cry no more

01:05:38.037 --> 01:05:40.632
Applause to Jonnhy and Josh!

01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:48.181
Great Knockout, Adam.

01:05:48.216 --> 01:05:51.352
- Blake, help him. - It will be difficult pro Adam!

01:05:51.387 --> 01:05:54.845
Jonnhy his voice has extension

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.924
and you have a great stage presence.

01:05:56.959 --> 01:05:59.812
You do not stop.

01:05:59.847 --> 01:06:04.846
You tried to place the microphone on the stand, but refused.

01:06:04.881 --> 01:06:07.790
I'll put it. No, no you're not!

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.646
It's fun to watch him perform.

01:06:11.378 --> 01:06:13.579
So Bruce Lee comes,

01:06:14.416 --> 01:06:19.953
and literally, he kills a fly with a kick.

01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:23.004
- Right in the middle of the stage. - You're such an idiot.

01:06:23.039 --> 01:06:25.620
The vocals were another level.

01:06:25.655 --> 01:06:28.243
Because of Chuck Norris movement,

01:06:28.278 --> 01:06:32.633
and what happened next, I would choose Josh.

01:06:32.668 --> 01:06:34.166
Thank you, mentor. Alicia.

01:06:34.474 --> 01:06:37.544
- Do not understand you. - Neither do I understand what he says.

01:06:37.579 --> 01:06:42.174
Has a dead fly there, he jumped up and killed.

01:06:43.036 --> 01:06:46.227
Johnny, did an amazing job. I love their energy,

01:06:46.262 --> 01:06:49.823
the sound of your voice, you work well on stage.

01:06:49.858 --> 01:06:51.591
Josh, you're 18.

01:06:51.626 --> 01:06:54.541
There is a lot to learn,

01:06:54.576 --> 01:06:56.675
but I was taken by you.

01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:00.109
Especially as you let go.

01:07:00.144 --> 01:07:02.413
I do not think Adam needs help.

01:07:02.468 --> 01:07:05.522
Everyone needs less the Adam.

01:07:05.557 --> 01:07:08.865
- Need? - He knows everything, you do not need.

01:07:09.603 --> 01:07:14.008
Josh, it's almost impossible to sing this song. It's insane.

01:07:14.043 --> 01:07:16.473
- I can not. - It was amazing.

01:07:16.508 --> 01:07:19.352
I want you and Blake know,

01:07:19.387 --> 01:07:22.156
I did the same kick in the past.

01:07:22.157 --> 01:07:23.457
So...

01:07:25.361 --> 01:07:27.333
Johnny, you're natural on stage.

01:07:27.368 --> 01:07:31.786
You hold us and we have to remember that sings.

01:07:31.821 --> 01:07:33.776
There is a lot going personality.

01:07:33.811 --> 01:07:38.385
But it is hard to resist, want to see a 18 year old

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:41.875
with such an unusual approach,

01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:44.658
a voice rock. It makes me curious.

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:47.139
I would say, "Let's Josh! I want more!"

01:07:47.174 --> 01:07:48.674
Do not know...

01:07:50.017 --> 01:07:53.128
Johnny returned after not turn a chair.

01:07:53.163 --> 01:07:56.181
This is already a success.

01:07:56.216 --> 01:07:58.622
You have improved and I knew he would.

01:07:58.657 --> 01:08:01.270
I'm glad that happens in my team.

01:08:01.305 --> 01:08:05.201
Josh, this song is one of the most difficult for a man.

01:08:05.505 --> 01:08:06.833
I do not know how he managed.

01:08:06.868 --> 01:08:09.223
It was all in full voice. Not used falsetto!

01:08:09.258 --> 01:08:11.613
Like ... what madness. You are insane.

01:08:11.648 --> 01:08:14.679
This is hard, but I have to choose.

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:18.819
The winner of the knockout ...

01:08:21.154 --> 01:08:22.841
The winner of the knockout ...

01:08:24.787 --> 01:08:26.131
is Josh.

01:08:26.736 --> 01:08:30.662
Josh, congratulations, you go Classifiers.

01:08:30.698 --> 01:08:33.274
He has a pure tone of voice.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:35.734
It is always strong and accurate.

01:08:35.769 --> 01:08:39.131
I had to reward his audacity to sing

01:08:39.167 --> 01:08:41.216
a song so hard and raze.

01:08:42.792 --> 01:08:45.395
I'm excited to go Classifiers.

01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:47.678
It is a journey of discovery for him.

01:08:47.712 --> 01:08:50.897
- I love watching him flourish. - Thanks, Dad.

01:08:52.367 --> 01:08:54.618
Mentors, Johnny can be stolen.

01:08:54.819 --> 01:08:57.281
Johnny, that is something to mentor?

01:08:58.069 --> 01:09:01.486
Thanks for the chance. From the bottom of my heart.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:05.546
Aplausos ao Johnny Rayes.

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:09.836
Leave Johnny was not easy.

01:09:11.484 --> 01:09:12.939
I like him.

01:09:16.518 --> 01:09:20.642
You can purchase today's music on iTunes,

01:09:20.919 --> 01:09:22.929
or hear them in the Apple Music.

01:09:27.453 --> 01:09:29.962
- Then ...
- What does this have to do with you?

01:09:29.997 --> 01:09:31.442
the final double of the night!

01:09:31.477 --> 01:09:34.917
Do not disappoint me!

01:09:40.246 --> 01:09:41.642
I quit!

01:09:43.008 --> 01:09:45.490
We have a theft!

01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:52.371
We're back to the knockouts.

01:09:52.984 --> 01:09:54.728
- Hi Hello.

01:09:55.512 --> 01:09:58.235
- Welcome to my team! - Thank you for saving me.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.591
Ashley want to mix
country and soul .

01:10:02.626 --> 01:10:05.666
Lilli tem natural.

01:10:05.773 --> 01:10:08.037
Both have a strong approach.

01:10:08.072 --> 01:10:10.351
I think it makes sense to be together.

01:10:10.385 --> 01:10:11.716
How is your father?

01:10:12.267 --> 01:10:14.983
Sometimes good, others bad.

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:17.083
- I love you. - Me too.

01:10:17.118 --> 01:10:20.163
My father has Alzheimer .

01:10:20.392 --> 01:10:21.757
This is hard.

01:10:21.792 --> 01:10:27.111
The man who took care of you, needs care now.

01:10:27.896 --> 01:10:31.744
childhood dreams come true.

01:10:31.779 --> 01:10:33.387
Music country is sacred.

01:10:33.422 --> 01:10:35.225
There is much soul within you.

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.624
I choose the Blake.

01:10:41.876 --> 01:10:43.848
We have a theft!

01:10:43.883 --> 01:10:45.810
Blake started the team,

01:10:45.811 --> 01:10:48.428
but I am the only country
in Alicia Team.

01:10:48.429 --> 01:10:51.002
Music soul and country
belong together.

01:10:51.037 --> 01:10:55.412
I want to discover more of who you want to be.

01:10:55.447 --> 01:11:00.628
I can learn from it to be more daring.

01:11:00.663 --> 01:11:02.166
I'm excited for it.

01:11:06.335 --> 01:11:09.704
For my knockout round I'm singing "Fancy"
by Reba McEntire.

01:11:13.604 --> 01:11:18.564
The original version has a country vibe and soul .

01:11:18.599 --> 01:11:20.290
That's really me.

01:11:24.187 --> 01:11:26.325
See Ashley rehearse ... Our ...

01:11:26.528 --> 01:11:30.967
She has a voice that covers the whole environment.

01:11:31.686 --> 01:11:33.010
I pressed.

01:11:35.558 --> 01:11:36.978
Legal!

01:11:37.013 --> 01:11:40.612
It is complicated, there are many words.

01:11:41.584 --> 01:11:43.084
They are all important.

01:11:43.119 --> 01:11:45.779
All the excitement has to be there.

01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:47.385
It's challenging.

01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:51.038
It has a little pain there,

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:54.316
her mother knew that there was no other choice.

01:11:54.351 --> 01:11:59.089
It's sad. She said: Do not disappoint me!

01:11:59.394 --> 01:12:01.837
Wow, that's heavy!

01:12:01.872 --> 01:12:04.852
You have to decide how you feel.

01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:08.573
It seems that you carry the pain of the world.

01:12:09.319 --> 01:12:11.103
Doing all the family.

01:12:11.138 --> 01:12:16.918
Having Alicia trying to make me identify,

01:12:17.514 --> 01:12:19.133
It was quite powerful.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:21.837
Things with my father ... This is my life.

01:12:22.006 --> 01:12:24.204
I will work hard for everything.

01:12:28.552 --> 01:12:32.675
It is a deep, painful, exposed song.

01:12:32.710 --> 01:12:35.953
You have to work a lot, but started well.

01:12:35.988 --> 01:12:37.386
How are you?

01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:41.283
- What song! - What voice, girl! Insane!

01:12:41.465 --> 01:12:45.759
Before the hearings, I worked in a restaurant.

01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:48.457
Always looking for a show.

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.573
Suddenly I heard people screaming and cheering,

01:12:57.608 --> 01:13:01.010
I thought, "God, I got!"

01:13:04.789 --> 01:13:06.600
What is going on?

01:13:10.731 --> 01:13:15.688
I want to show that it was right to believe me.

01:13:15.723 --> 01:13:18.453
- Lilli can win. - I love it.

01:13:21.934 --> 01:13:25.889
Escolhi "Tear Dry on their Own"
da Amy Winehouse.

01:13:27.273 --> 01:13:31.543
It is influenced by musicians jazz old.

01:13:31.578 --> 01:13:36.564
She managed to modernize it.

01:13:36.599 --> 01:13:39.434
That's how I like to sing too.

01:13:43.533 --> 01:13:46.348
Lilli's voice is impeccable.

01:13:46.383 --> 01:13:49.650
It's intimidating to know that I will face it.

01:13:52.517 --> 01:13:55.750
What does this have to do with you?

01:13:55.785 --> 01:13:59.056
I've been through something that ends.

01:13:59.421 --> 01:14:01.400
You have to rebuild.

01:14:01.435 --> 01:14:03.736
Music is about having heartbroken.

01:14:03.737 --> 01:14:07.229
I identify because it happened to me.

01:14:07.322 --> 01:14:09.313
I've been left behind.

01:14:09.348 --> 01:14:12.234
You have to see how each verse resonates in you.

01:14:12.269 --> 01:14:14.922
It's a great song, but it is challenging.

01:14:14.957 --> 01:14:18.848
You can sing beautifully and did not spend emotion.

01:14:18.883 --> 01:14:21.052
Maybe a little slower.

01:14:24.603 --> 01:14:27.162
You can leave as if drunk.

01:14:27.197 --> 01:14:29.734
It will also help.

01:14:29.769 --> 01:14:32.883
Must resonate ...

01:14:38.299 --> 01:14:41.222
I have to show everything. I can not shut myself.

01:14:41.234 --> 01:14:43.130
It was much better.

01:14:43.165 --> 01:14:44.925
A million times better.

01:14:44.938 --> 01:14:46.332
This is hard.

01:14:46.367 --> 01:14:50.443
Both have strong vocals. And unique styles.

01:14:50.478 --> 01:14:54.998
Let's see who shows up.

01:14:55.033 --> 01:14:58.144
I will choose this.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.889
- God! - How hard!

01:15:04.243 --> 01:15:06.759
Com "Fancy",
Ashley Levin.

01:15:13.666 --> 01:15:16.310
I remember it all very well
looking back

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.441
Was the summer I turned 18

01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:21.081
We lived in a one-room,
rundown shack

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:23.542
On the outskirts of New Orleans

01:15:23.577 --> 01:15:26.020
We didn't have money
for food or rent

01:15:26.055 --> 01:15:28.243
To say the least,
we were hard-pressed

01:15:28.569 --> 01:15:30.695
Mama spent every last
penny we had

01:15:30.696 --> 01:15:33.084
To buy me a dancing dress

01:15:33.354 --> 01:15:35.722
She handed me a heart-shaped
locket that said

01:15:35.757 --> 01:15:37.936
"To thine own self be true"

01:15:37.971 --> 01:15:40.658
And I shivered as I watched
a roach crawl across

01:15:40.693 --> 01:15:42.794
The toe of my high-heeled shoe

01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:45.415
It sounded like somebody else
that was talking

01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:47.511
Asking:
"Mama, what do I do?"

01:15:47.546 --> 01:15:50.345
She said: "Just be nice
to the gentlemen, Fancy,

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.311
They'll be nice to you"

01:15:52.346 --> 01:15:54.550
She said:
"Here's your one chance, Fancy,

01:15:54.585 --> 01:15:56.395
Don't let me down"

01:15:57.129 --> 01:15:59.303
She said:
"Here's your one chance, Fancy,

01:15:59.338 --> 01:16:00.958
Don't let me down.

01:16:01.461 --> 01:16:04.764
Lord, forgive me for what I do

01:16:04.799 --> 01:16:07.137
If you want out,
then it's up to you

01:16:07.172 --> 01:16:08.618
Now don't let
me down now, girl

01:16:08.653 --> 01:16:10.912
Your mama's gonna
move you uptown"

01:16:12.121 --> 01:16:14.514
It wasn't long after
a benevolent man

01:16:14.515 --> 01:16:16.690
Took me in off the streets

01:16:16.953 --> 01:16:19.314
And one week later,
I was pouring his tea

01:16:19.349 --> 01:16:21.380
In a five-room hotel suite

01:16:21.415 --> 01:16:24.219
Oh, I charmed a king,
a congressman

01:16:24.254 --> 01:16:26.489
An occasional aristocrat

01:16:26.524 --> 01:16:28.390
And now I got me
a Georgia mansion

01:16:28.425 --> 01:16:31.024
And an elegant
New York townhouse flat

01:16:31.059 --> 01:16:36.375
And I ain't done bad, no

01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:41.184
"Here's your one chance, Fancy,
don't let me down

01:16:41.335 --> 01:16:44.594
Here's your one chance, Fancy,
don't let me down

01:16:45.031 --> 01:16:48.378
Lord, forgive me for what I do

01:16:48.513 --> 01:16:50.775
If you want out,
well, it's up to you

01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:52.149
Don't let me down, girl

01:16:52.184 --> 01:16:54.575
Your mama's
gonna move you uptown

01:16:54.969 --> 01:16:56.821
No, don't let me down,

01:16:56.822 --> 01:17:02.811
your mama's gonna
move up uptown"

01:17:09.635 --> 01:17:10.991
Thanks.

01:17:20.794 --> 01:17:22.320
We are back.

01:17:24.987 --> 01:17:27.430
Agora, cantando
"Tears Dry On Their Own",

01:17:27.465 --> 01:17:29.415
Lilli Passero.

01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:35.026
All I can ever be to you

01:17:35.061 --> 01:17:36.990
Is a darkness that we knew

01:17:37.025 --> 01:17:40.873
And this regret
I've got accustomed to

01:17:41.112 --> 01:17:42.902
Once it was so right

01:17:42.937 --> 01:17:45.186
When we were at our height

01:17:45.221 --> 01:17:48.850
Waiting for you
in the hotel at night

01:17:48.885 --> 01:17:50.553
I knew I hadn't met my match

01:17:50.588 --> 01:17:53.163
But every moment
we could snatch

01:17:53.198 --> 01:17:56.681
I don't know why I got attached

01:17:56.879 --> 01:17:58.979
It's my responsibility

01:17:59.014 --> 01:18:00.956
You don't owe nothing to me

01:18:00.991 --> 01:18:05.100
But to walk away,
I have no capacity

01:18:05.135 --> 01:18:07.724
He, he walks away

01:18:07.936 --> 01:18:09.908
The sun goes down

01:18:09.943 --> 01:18:12.959
He takes the day,
but I am grown

01:18:12.994 --> 01:18:17.011
And in your way,
my blue shade

01:18:17.046 --> 01:18:21.536
My tears dry on their own

01:18:21.571 --> 01:18:23.735
So we are history

01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:25.748
Your shadow covers me

01:18:25.783 --> 01:18:30.567
The sky above a blaze

01:18:30.568 --> 01:18:32.267
He walks away

01:18:32.302 --> 01:18:34.277
The sun goes down

01:18:34.424 --> 01:18:37.319
He takes the day,
but I'm grown

01:18:37.354 --> 01:18:41.472
And in your way,
my blue shade

01:18:41.473 --> 01:18:45.707
My tears dry on their own

01:18:45.986 --> 01:18:48.006
Wish I could say no regrets

01:18:48.041 --> 01:18:49.932
No emotional debt

01:18:50.061 --> 01:18:53.451
'Cause as we kiss goodbye,
the sun sets

01:18:54.128 --> 01:18:56.215
So we are history

01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:58.257
The shadow covers me

01:18:58.292 --> 01:19:02.428
The sky above a blaze
that only lovers see

01:19:02.842 --> 01:19:04.771
He walks away

01:19:04.806 --> 01:19:06.821
The sun goes down

01:19:06.856 --> 01:19:09.894
He takes the day,
but I am grown

01:19:09.929 --> 01:19:14.058
And in your way,
my deep shade

01:19:14.093 --> 01:19:17.458
My tears dry on their own

01:19:17.493 --> 01:19:20.534
My tears dry

01:19:20.569 --> 01:19:26.793
Own

01:19:29.888 --> 01:19:33.693
Applause for Ashley and Lilli, folks!

01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:37.326
Good job. Gwen Stefani, what do you think?

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.970
Ashley, her voice is so familiar.

01:19:41.005 --> 01:19:42.817
- Thanks. - It's so strong and confident.

01:19:42.852 --> 01:19:45.025
It is so rich, and it is beautiful.

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:48.143
And Lilli, you caught this mood music ...

01:19:48.178 --> 01:19:49.854
It's so theatrical. I love this song...

01:19:49.855 --> 01:19:52.156
And you did what was necessary, I found very beautiful.

01:19:52.191 --> 01:19:54.207
His voice is very strong. Sincerely,

01:19:54.242 --> 01:19:56.077
swear to you, Alicia,

01:19:56.112 --> 01:19:57.922
this is a really hard pairing.

01:19:57.957 --> 01:20:00.219
I'm so sorry. I do not ... I'm being sincere.

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:01.630
- I do not know what to say. - I know.

01:20:01.631 --> 01:20:04.876
If you had to choose, I think I'd go with Ashley.

01:20:06.666 --> 01:20:07.966
Thanks.

01:20:08.155 --> 01:20:10.283
The difference between them is that Ashley

01:20:10.284 --> 01:20:15.028
It has evolved a lot and soon, amazing.

01:20:15.029 --> 01:20:17.270
Lilli, when I saw his last performance

01:20:17.271 --> 01:20:18.872
I thought "this girl can win."

01:20:18.873 --> 01:20:20.173
I'd go with Lilli.

01:20:20.174 --> 01:20:23.141
The way you behave is champion of The Voice.

01:20:23.563 --> 01:20:25.645
Right. Thank you, Adam. Blake?

01:20:26.682 --> 01:20:32.516
The interesting thing Ashley is a blast to perform.

01:20:32.517 --> 01:20:36.853
Lilli is already more serene, calm and composed.

01:20:36.854 --> 01:20:40.895
She does what she was born to do, it seems.

01:20:40.896 --> 01:20:43.340
If fits to me, I would also go with Lilli.

01:20:43.341 --> 01:20:46.405
Thanks, Blake. Alicia, the final decision is yours.

01:20:47.392 --> 01:20:48.986
I quit!

01:20:51.989 --> 01:20:53.720
This is too hard!

01:20:53.721 --> 01:20:56.148
I'm still getting to know Ashley.

01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:58.548
Lilli, when I heard him in the hearings,

01:20:58.549 --> 01:21:02.925
you have something that I understand deeply!

01:21:02.926 --> 01:21:05.838
Ashley, this song is so complex.

01:21:05.839 --> 01:21:08.969
So many words and all are important!

01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:12.912
We talk a lot about it. It is difficult to follow this pace,

01:21:12.913 --> 01:21:17.747
sing this song about complex super humans.

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:21.571
But you could. Lilli, I know what we can do!

01:21:21.572 --> 01:21:24.794
You give the impression that it is already an artist ready.

01:21:24.795 --> 01:21:27.379
I say that you are "pre-cooked". It's like that with you.

01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:31.134
Have you ever come this way, as a charming snakes,

01:21:31.135 --> 01:21:33.336
- it's very cool! - Difficult decision, Alicia.

01:21:33.337 --> 01:21:34.637
Who won this Knockout?

01:21:40.233 --> 01:21:42.007
Sure. Sure!

01:21:42.851 --> 01:21:44.342
I have to choose ...

01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:47.279
I knew today would be difficult for me.

01:21:48.955 --> 01:21:51.026
The winner of this knockout ...

01:21:53.887 --> 01:21:55.187
It's Ashley.

01:21:55.188 --> 01:22:00.345
Ashley, congratulations. You are in Classifiers.

01:22:03.376 --> 01:22:05.703
I do not think I'm in Live Programs!

01:22:05.704 --> 01:22:08.851
I'm still in the team Alicia and I'm so excited!

01:22:09.489 --> 01:22:13.309
Ashley chose because she wants to mix country and soul ,

01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:17.022
and I feel I can help a lot of it!

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.147
Mentors, Lilli can be stolen.

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:27.558
We have a theft!

01:22:28.395 --> 01:22:31.884
Adam Levine Rouba
a Lilli da Alicia!

01:22:35.274 --> 01:22:37.176
O Blake Shelton entra na parada!

01:22:40.176 --> 01:22:43.017
2 are now mentors. Adam, why do you want to Lilli?

01:22:43.018 --> 01:22:45.048
Nor do I believe that this is happening,

01:22:45.049 --> 01:22:47.600
I found it really the last time I saw you sing,

01:22:47.601 --> 01:22:50.601
you can win. I think you have the necessary

01:22:50.602 --> 01:22:53.643
and I want you on my team please!

01:22:53.644 --> 01:22:55.651
I also think you can win.

01:22:55.652 --> 01:23:00.147
And this is the 2nd time I turn to you.

01:23:00.148 --> 01:23:02.561
- Adam did not turn the hearings. - Do not fall for it!

01:23:02.562 --> 01:23:06.623
I believe in you from the 1st day.

01:23:06.624 --> 01:23:09.575
Please do not fall for it to "come to you 10 years ago."

01:23:09.576 --> 01:23:11.642
- For no matter ... - It yes!

01:23:11.643 --> 01:23:12.943
No matter not.

01:23:12.944 --> 01:23:17.166
If you think what mentor believes in you from the beginning ...

01:23:17.167 --> 01:23:18.467
Does not matter!

01:23:18.468 --> 01:23:21.163
What matters is who believes in you to the end!

01:23:21.164 --> 01:23:23.415
By the way, David Beckham wants hairstyle back!

01:23:24.355 --> 01:23:26.377
It's not how it starts, is how it ends!

01:23:26.378 --> 01:23:28.479
You are mine, do not fall on his bullshit.

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:31.534
Thank you, mentor. Lilli is with you!

01:23:32.392 --> 01:23:35.209
Who will be your new mentor? Adam or Blake?

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:36.717
Come on, Lilli!

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:46.112
- I choose Adam. - That!

01:23:46.113 --> 01:23:48.376
Adam rouba Lilli Passero!

01:23:48.377 --> 01:23:50.590
Congratulations, we see the Classifiers.

01:23:50.591 --> 01:23:51.917
- Thank you. - Thanks.

01:23:51.918 --> 01:23:55.290
Lilli is talented, charismatic, powerful

01:23:55.291 --> 01:23:56.591
and has an amazing voice.

01:23:56.592 --> 01:23:58.343
Keep an eye, it is lacrante diva.

01:23:59.408 --> 01:24:01.509
I know it was the 1st turning to me, thank you.

01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:02.810
I had to go with Adam,

01:24:02.811 --> 01:24:05.004
for he put hot in the race for me.

01:24:05.005 --> 01:24:07.520
I love his works with past artists.

01:24:07.521 --> 01:24:10.237
There is much potential in what we can do together.

01:24:10.755 --> 01:24:12.136
Fuck, I quit me.

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:16.988
Tomorrow, mentors lead performances to another level.

01:24:16.989 --> 01:24:18.827
well expresses the story.

01:24:18.828 --> 01:24:21.347
You have style, keep pro right time.

01:24:25.366 --> 01:24:27.321
The dispute has never been so fierce.

01:24:27.322 --> 01:24:29.633
Decisions have never been so difficult.

01:24:29.634 --> 01:24:31.533
- Who won the knockout? - I do not know.

01:24:31.534 --> 01:24:35.340
Nothing compares to Rob that will rock the competition!

01:24:35.341 --> 01:24:37.331
I'm going to shock everyone.

01:24:37.332 --> 01:24:39.207
We have a theft!
