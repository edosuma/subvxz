00:01.827 --> 00:03.757
I think you have a customer,
Mr. Cleanwrench.

00:03.797 --> 00:06.013
You sell the station
to Octiline Oil Company...

00:06.038 --> 00:07.248
and we let you live.

00:07.264 --> 00:10.664
Those people control half
the mob in this country.

00:10.701 --> 00:12.412
Hey, who are you?

00:12.463 --> 00:14.957
Carlos Mendoza, Miami.

00:14.999 --> 00:17.709
Whatever Sonny's into has
got to be on those trucks.

00:17.767 --> 00:19.837
You bozos wanna get
this thing out of my way?

00:19.877 --> 00:22.756
You guys ain't cops. Why are
you sticking noses in this?

00:22.824 --> 00:24.383
This guy is an imposter.

00:25.969 --> 00:28.220
I'm gonna pay
that station a visit.

00:31.890 --> 00:34.351
<i>In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:34.434 --> 00:36.145
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:36.228 --> 00:37.688
<i>for a crime they didn't commit.</i>

00:37.771 --> 00:38.981
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:39.064 --> 00:40.607
<i>from a maximum-security
stockade...</i>

00:40.691 --> 00:42.234
<i>to the Los Angeles underground.</i>

00:42.401 --> 00:44.069
<i>Today, still wanted
by the government...</i>

00:44.153 --> 00:45.946
<i>they survive
as soldiers of fortune.</i>

00:45.988 --> 00:48.532
<i>If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...</i>

00:48.615 --> 00:49.867
<i>and if you can find them...</i>

00:49.950 --> 00:52.327
<i>maybe you can hire the A-Team.</i>

02:21.959 --> 02:23.627
Looking good, Kelvin.

02:24.336 --> 02:26.838
You did a real nice job, Kelvin.

02:27.256 --> 02:29.925
When you get finished
putting the hose away...

02:30.259 --> 02:32.594
stack those tires
by the far wall.

02:32.678 --> 02:34.179
You betcha, Zack.

02:41.728 --> 02:45.148
You don't have to take them
in one trip, Kelvin.

02:46.108 --> 02:47.234
I don't?

02:47.609 --> 02:48.860
No, son.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.570
Just so they get over there.

02:50.821 --> 02:53.282
You can take as many
trips as you need.

02:54.950 --> 02:56.576
- Really?
- Really.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.242
How's life, farmer?

03:38.285 --> 03:39.703
Get off my property.
Boy.

03:39.786 --> 03:42.205
Hey, is that any way to
greet a fellow businessman?

03:42.289 --> 03:44.333
Look, I ain't gonna be selling.

03:44.624 --> 03:48.003
You got Randy Wilton
and Pete Travers...

03:48.462 --> 03:50.589
but you ain't gonna get me.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.968
You know, some people
are just too dumb...

03:55.218 --> 03:57.304
to know a good deal
when it comes along.

03:57.763 --> 03:59.556
Ain't that right, Kelvin?

04:01.183 --> 04:02.267
Yeah.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.936
He says yeah.

04:05.395 --> 04:06.646
See that, Zack?

04:06.772 --> 04:08.815
What Kelvin, here,
is trying to tell you...

04:09.316 --> 04:11.068
is you should sell now...

04:11.485 --> 04:13.612
while the place
is still in good shape.

04:14.363 --> 04:15.906
Ain't that right, Kelvin?

04:20.660 --> 04:23.455
You see, you never know
when a valuable asset...

04:23.538 --> 04:25.749
is gonna lose
some of its resale value.

04:39.763 --> 04:41.139
Come on, big guy.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.601
Now, even you ain't that thick.

04:57.489 --> 04:58.490
All right.

04:58.573 --> 05:01.451
Now here's the terms of the agreement
we talked about the other day.

05:01.660 --> 05:04.538
You sell the station
to Octiline Oil Company...

05:05.247 --> 05:06.748
and we let you live.

05:11.503 --> 05:14.256
Think about it.
Then sign it.

05:16.508 --> 05:18.427
We'll be back
in a couple of days.

06:21.072 --> 06:23.200
Hello? Anybody home?

06:23.742 --> 06:26.453
Forgive me,
Father, for I have sinned.

06:27.662 --> 06:28.747
Pardon me?

06:28.872 --> 06:31.458
That's what you wished
to say, wasn't it?

06:31.833 --> 06:33.126
Oh, yeah.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.504
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

06:35.670 --> 06:37.964
What do you wish to confess?

06:38.089 --> 06:40.342
Well, nothing.

06:41.092 --> 06:44.095
I went to see this Mr. Lee
at the Chinese laundry...

06:44.221 --> 06:45.555
and he sent me...

06:45.764 --> 06:48.099
to this guy
at the Buick dealership...

06:50.310 --> 06:52.771
and he told me that I
could find this fellow...

06:52.896 --> 06:54.773
if I came looking here and...

06:54.856 --> 06:56.608
Whom do you seek?

06:56.816 --> 06:58.109
I seek the A-Team.

06:58.235 --> 07:01.696
The A-Team? Are they not criminals?
Are they not outlaws?

07:01.780 --> 07:05.200
Are they not fugitives from
those that uphold the law?

07:05.367 --> 07:07.410
Well, I don't know about that.

07:07.994 --> 07:11.248
But I was just hoping maybe they could
help me with these slimeballs...

07:11.373 --> 07:12.666
excuse me, Father...

07:12.874 --> 07:16.253
these lowdown critters that are
trying to run me off my station.

07:16.378 --> 07:17.796
Tell me your problem.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.047
Yes, sir.

07:19.297 --> 07:24.135
Well, a few weeks ago these
hoodlums from Octiline Gas...

07:24.261 --> 07:28.723
they started muscling in on the
station owners at Green Tree Creek.

07:28.932 --> 07:32.686
Did they commit violent acts
towards you and your property?

07:32.769 --> 07:33.770
Yes, they did.

07:33.853 --> 07:36.523
Did you seek out
the proper authorities?

07:36.606 --> 07:38.984
Yeah, I went to the police...

07:39.609 --> 07:42.112
but they said
they needed more proof.

07:42.946 --> 07:44.864
Corroboration
is what they called it.

07:45.865 --> 07:48.743
Well, the other owners, they
won't swear out a complaint.

07:48.827 --> 07:51.454
They are too afraid. They
have families and all...

07:51.913 --> 07:53.415
and I just have Kelvin.

07:56.626 --> 07:58.420
I really do need some help.

07:58.587 --> 08:01.256
God moves in mysterious ways.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.633
Then you will help me
find the A-Team?

08:03.717 --> 08:05.218
You've already found them.

08:06.553 --> 08:09.973
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.854
So this guy from
Octiline rolls in and says...

08:15.937 --> 08:18.315
you got a partner whether you
want one or not. Is that right?

08:18.607 --> 08:19.566
That's it.

08:19.608 --> 08:21.860
Sounds like simple
Grade A extortion, Hannibal.

08:21.985 --> 08:23.903
What do we know
about Octiline, Face?

08:24.029 --> 08:27.532
I think it's a Midwestern outfit.
You know, Chicago, Detroit.

08:27.616 --> 08:28.908
Why would somebody
wanna muscle in...

08:28.992 --> 08:30.869
on a few independent gas
stations in Green Tree?

08:30.952 --> 08:34.289
We didn't stop to ask them while
they were threatening our families.

08:34.371 --> 08:36.291
They set my tow truck on fire.

08:36.374 --> 08:37.751
Blew it up
right in my front yard.

08:37.833 --> 08:39.753
My kids are scared
to walk to school.

08:39.836 --> 08:42.631
Hey, man, ain't nobody in the world got
a right to take away what is yours.

08:42.714 --> 08:44.799
And the only people who are gonna
keep them from doing it, is you.

08:44.924 --> 08:48.595
Now, we can help you, but you gotta
take a stand. Now, are you with us?

08:52.474 --> 08:53.600
I am.

08:55.268 --> 08:58.063
- Count me in.
- Yeah.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.731
Sounds like we got
a mandate, Hannibal.

08:59.814 --> 09:00.899
Okay.

09:01.836 --> 09:04.027
Who's the head man
at Octiline out here?

09:04.152 --> 09:07.238
No idea. We just see
this punk McMahon.

09:07.364 --> 09:09.991
Doesn't sound like your
typical oil industry exec.

09:10.033 --> 09:11.743
No, we need the main man.

09:11.826 --> 09:15.497
Tighten the valve a little,
Colonel, see where the fluid runs.

09:15.830 --> 09:17.540
Sounds about right, Captain.

09:19.042 --> 09:20.794
The man's got a plan.

09:33.056 --> 09:34.974
Yes, service with a smile.

09:35.225 --> 09:36.518
Oh, nice, Murdock.

09:36.559 --> 09:39.312
Service is the keyword
in the term "service station."

09:39.521 --> 09:40.647
I never thought of it that way.

09:40.730 --> 09:42.482
And we gonna provide
full service...

09:42.649 --> 09:44.401
because people are tired
of passing their money...

09:44.526 --> 09:46.152
through bulletproof windows
in the middle of the night.

09:46.236 --> 09:47.731
They want a little bit
of personal attention.

09:47.756 --> 09:49.005
I think you're onto
something there.

09:49.030 --> 09:51.783
One should never have
to pump gas by one's self.

09:51.866 --> 09:53.243
Especially when one
is going to dinner.

09:53.368 --> 09:56.246
Because one can never get the smell
of gasoline off of one's fingers.

09:56.371 --> 09:58.498
I have never been able
to do that myself.

09:59.082 --> 10:00.125
But...

10:00.417 --> 10:02.544
I think you have a customer,
Mr. Cleanwrench.

10:10.468 --> 10:12.220
- Fill her up?
- I don't need any gas.

10:12.303 --> 10:14.139
Check under the hood then?
Oh, there's no need.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.266
A well-maintained automobile
is gonna last you about...

10:16.349 --> 10:18.268
50,000 miles longer
than a neglected one.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.478
It's a rental car.
Look, I just need directions.

10:20.562 --> 10:21.646
Where do you wanna go?

10:21.730 --> 10:22.939
Mockingbird Lane.

10:23.022 --> 10:24.023
Mockingbird Lane?

10:24.107 --> 10:26.443
Is that East Mockingbird Lane
or West Mockingbird Lane?

10:26.568 --> 10:28.319
And what is the address
on Mockingbird Lane?

10:28.403 --> 10:30.447
Just tell me where Mockingbird
Lane is located, please.

10:30.572 --> 10:33.700
Well, if you don't know the address
is, perhaps I could call the party...

10:33.783 --> 10:35.785
that you're looking for and they
could come here and visit you.

10:35.827 --> 10:37.871
Or, you can have
one of our free maps.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.254
This idea of full service
is great, Murdock.

10:46.337 --> 10:47.672
I knew it, I knew it.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.215
But quit giving them maps away.

10:49.257 --> 10:51.050
They ain't been free
in 10 years.

10:52.010 --> 10:53.261
Yes, sir.

10:54.888 --> 10:58.183
Now, you see, you gotta
tighten the nuts just right.

10:58.641 --> 11:00.101
Use your torque wrench.

11:00.226 --> 11:01.936
And don't go over
the pound weight.

11:04.689 --> 11:06.274
I don't know, B.A.

11:07.317 --> 11:09.527
I sure wish I could figure
things out like you.

11:09.611 --> 11:12.614
Hey, man, I don't wanna hear
you putting yourself down.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.825
Here. Now, do it
like I showed you.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.871
Where'd you learn all this?

11:19.954 --> 11:21.164
In the army.

11:21.664 --> 11:22.999
In the army?

11:23.750 --> 11:24.876
Wow.

11:25.502 --> 11:26.961
I wish I could be in the army.

11:27.045 --> 11:30.006
Hey, you can learn it all right
here from Mr. Badwrench.

11:30.089 --> 11:31.216
That's me.

11:31.341 --> 11:32.801
Mr. Badwrench?

11:33.426 --> 11:34.719
All right.

11:53.321 --> 11:54.906
What are you doing, B.A.?

11:56.699 --> 11:58.409
Well, that's just Sheriff Ann.

11:58.493 --> 12:00.078
I'll introduce you
if you're shy.

12:00.995 --> 12:02.121
Quiet, Kelvin.

12:02.205 --> 12:04.916
We're gonna play a little
game called hide and seek.

12:06.125 --> 12:07.126
Fill her up?

12:07.210 --> 12:08.753
Just dropped by to say hello.

12:10.046 --> 12:11.673
Sheriff Ann Plummer.

12:11.881 --> 12:13.758
I'm H.M. Murdock,
at your service.

12:13.842 --> 12:14.801
Hi.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.554
Hi. Didn't catch your name.

12:18.179 --> 12:20.348
John Smith.
How you doing?

12:20.431 --> 12:21.432
Fine.

12:21.933 --> 12:23.560
When did you take over for Zack?

12:23.685 --> 12:26.521
We didn't really. Just some
old friends helping out.

12:26.563 --> 12:27.480
Oh.

12:28.064 --> 12:30.525
Welcome to Green Tree Creek.
Hope you like it here.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.318
I like what I see so far.

12:34.696 --> 12:36.197
You look very familiar.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.532
I'm flattered.

12:37.949 --> 12:39.242
Sheriff Plummer?

12:41.369 --> 12:42.787
Hope to see more of you.

12:42.871 --> 12:44.038
You will.

12:44.163 --> 12:47.000
- How you doing?
- Not bad, not bad.

12:47.709 --> 12:49.210
Any more trouble?

12:49.335 --> 12:51.212
No. Not since I got help.

12:51.838 --> 12:54.591
I guess you heard about
Pete Travers over on I-10.

12:54.632 --> 12:55.717
Had to sell.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.094
We've been through
this before, Zack.

12:58.553 --> 13:02.223
Unless they file charges, it's just
a normal business transaction.

13:02.765 --> 13:05.143
After they threaten
to kill your wife and kids.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.854
Well, unless he tells me that,
there's nothing I can do.

13:08.062 --> 13:10.440
Right now, all I got is a couple of
guys with out-of-state plates...

13:10.481 --> 13:12.233
trying to buy up gas stations.

13:13.985 --> 13:17.113
Well, maybe the law
can't do anything about it.

13:24.996 --> 13:26.080
See you.

13:32.086 --> 13:33.922
Service with a smile.

13:34.130 --> 13:35.590
Well, thank you.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.397
- Fill her up?
- No.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.357
Doesn't anybody stop
for gas anymore?

14:34.482 --> 14:36.025
Let me check your tire pressure.

14:41.364 --> 14:42.615
Don't touch my wheels.

14:42.699 --> 14:44.117
Did you eat pizza this morning?

14:44.242 --> 14:46.536
Get this clown out of my face.

14:46.661 --> 14:48.788
I want the owner, I don't
wanna talk to flunkies.

14:48.871 --> 14:50.248
Then you wanna talk to me, pal.

14:50.331 --> 14:51.165
You?

14:51.332 --> 14:53.334
What are you talking about?
I had a deal going with Zack.

14:53.418 --> 14:57.839
The deal is off. I'm the new legal owner.
Zack is my partner.

14:57.922 --> 15:00.550
We're keeping the station.
If that's not satisfactory...

15:00.717 --> 15:03.302
I wanna talk to your boss 'cause
I don't talk to flunkies either.

15:03.386 --> 15:04.470
I'm the boss.

15:04.554 --> 15:06.472
You're too stupid to be a boss.

15:09.767 --> 15:11.894
You don't know
what you're getting into here.

15:12.937 --> 15:14.439
I think I do.

15:15.148 --> 15:18.067
You got a couple of friends of mine
to let you takeover their stations.

15:18.192 --> 15:19.444
We're gonna buy them back.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.571
We got an offer
to make your boss.

15:23.364 --> 15:25.783
Let me summarize
the major deal points.

15:25.908 --> 15:28.244
We take them back, plus 10%.

15:28.453 --> 15:31.330
Your boss signs at the bottom.
You can witness it.

15:31.456 --> 15:32.790
Think so, huh?

15:34.834 --> 15:38.463
Well, that's a fancy dipstick you got
there, pal. I hope you know how to use it.

15:38.588 --> 15:39.922
Well, let's find out.

16:00.526 --> 16:03.488
Here, pal.
Here's the contract...

16:03.946 --> 16:05.656
and one of our free pens.

16:46.823 --> 16:48.991
I just don't like the idea...

16:49.075 --> 16:51.536
of B.A. taking apart
my brand-new truck.

16:51.661 --> 16:54.205
I'm sure he's just using it
to train Kelvin.

16:54.455 --> 16:58.334
I know, I know. But I worked so hard to
win it on the Wheel <i>of</i> Fortune, Face.

16:58.417 --> 17:01.045
We had to work so hard, okay?

17:01.129 --> 17:03.798
Besides, you're the one that took
the trip to Hawaii, without me.

17:03.881 --> 17:04.882
I know.

17:11.763 --> 17:13.182
Looks like he's at home.

17:45.423 --> 17:47.175
Oh, boy.
Who's the meatball?

17:47.258 --> 17:48.843
Please, please, Murdock.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.554
A little respect
for a member of the family.

17:59.896 --> 18:01.189
Zack's Service.

18:01.314 --> 18:05.109
Yeah, listen, Hannibal. This
is getting real interesting.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.904
Guess who McMahon ran to.

18:08.112 --> 18:09.322
Well, am I gonna like this?

18:09.405 --> 18:10.948
I think you gonna love it.

18:11.199 --> 18:13.159
Sonny Marlini.

18:13.367 --> 18:16.078
Sonny "The Enforcer" Marlini
from Detroit?

18:16.746 --> 18:20.958
The very same. Looking very tan,
healthy, and itching to kill.

18:21.042 --> 18:24.795
Sonny "The Enforcer" after a string of
gas stations in Green Tree Creek...

18:24.879 --> 18:26.380
does not add up, Face.

18:26.505 --> 18:27.840
Yeah, tell me about it.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.301
<i>Well, skip the
punk and stick with Marlini.</i>

18:30.384 --> 18:32.595
Yeah, look, gotta go,
Hannibal. Gotta go.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.097
I want you to secure
the shipment for the truck...

18:35.181 --> 18:38.184
at the state line and call me at the motel.
I wanna make sure it's here.

18:38.392 --> 18:40.478
- Then ride shotgun back to the house.
- Yes, sir.

18:40.603 --> 18:42.313
And, Mac, no mistakes, huh?

19:48.838 --> 19:50.047
Hi, there.

19:50.214 --> 19:51.549
Hi, yourself.

19:52.591 --> 19:53.426
Yeah.

19:53.509 --> 19:56.637
Well, you know, I could have
sworn I left this door open.

19:57.638 --> 19:59.682
Look at that. 208.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.559
I'm on the wrong floor.

20:01.726 --> 20:04.186
All these corridors
look the same, don't they?

20:04.395 --> 20:06.731
Yeah, well, I guess, I better
go down to the right floor.

20:06.897 --> 20:08.399
- Guess you'd better.
- Yeah.

20:08.482 --> 20:10.234
Well, it was nice seeing you.

20:20.995 --> 20:23.164
Boy, oh, boy.
This is just too small a town.

20:23.247 --> 20:25.041
Didn't you hear me honk?
I saw her pull up.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.168
No, I was too busy peeping.

20:30.338 --> 20:31.839
Yeah, Hannibal, listen.

20:31.922 --> 20:36.093
Sonny's got himself a room and a
girl at the Green Tree Motel.

20:36.344 --> 20:37.345
Check it out.

20:37.428 --> 20:38.846
<i>Check it out?
What am I gonna do?</i>

20:38.929 --> 20:41.724
Just knock on his door and ask him
what crimes he's planning to commit...

20:41.807 --> 20:42.975
while he's in town?

20:43.267 --> 20:44.935
Have Murdock knock on the door.

20:49.190 --> 20:50.649
Hey, Marty,
we've been on the phone.

20:50.733 --> 20:51.859
Hey, Trish, get the door!

20:51.942 --> 20:53.736
Hold on. Someone's at the door.
Hold on, Marty.

20:53.944 --> 20:55.529
<i>Sonny, I don't
got no towels in here.</i>

20:55.613 --> 20:57.156
Yeah?
Housekeeping.

20:57.239 --> 20:59.825
All right. Come on. About time
somebody cleans up this dump.

20:59.909 --> 21:02.036
- <i>Where's the soap?</i>
- Yeah, Marty.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.897
Yeah, good talking to you.
How you been?

21:03.922 --> 21:05.790
- <i>Get off the phone, Sonny.</i>
- Oh, yeah, you gonna make it then, right?

21:05.873 --> 21:08.376
All right, yeah,
it's 4087 Mockingbird Lane.

21:08.793 --> 21:10.044
When are you gonna be there?

21:10.169 --> 21:11.921
All right, I'll see you
over there then. Right.

21:12.838 --> 21:17.195
Oh, you must be
a very important man.

21:17.220 --> 21:18.319
What?

21:18.344 --> 21:20.137
Hey, this is
a great place, Sonny.

21:20.162 --> 21:22.593
Hey, miss.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.726
Hey, miss?
Wanna clean up the bathroom?

21:27.311 --> 21:28.479
Go on.

21:30.064 --> 21:33.275
What are you doing?
Hey, look. Miss, look.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.986
Make sure Trisha has some towels, will you?
Give her a lot of towels.

21:36.987 --> 21:41.283
You can have all the
towels that you want.

21:41.367 --> 21:45.037
Just please don't steal
any from me.

21:45.121 --> 21:46.705
Yeah, yeah.
Don't worry about it.

21:46.831 --> 21:48.958
Yeah. Hello. Tony Balloons!

21:49.041 --> 21:51.335
Yeah, Tony, how you doing?
How goes the war?

21:52.086 --> 21:54.755
The flu?
Oh, minchia, Tony.

21:55.673 --> 21:56.632
What?

21:56.799 --> 21:58.050
That bad?

21:58.634 --> 22:01.303
Oh, no, Tony. Wait a minute.
Let me get this down then.

22:02.138 --> 22:04.223
Give me that again.
Carlos...

22:04.306 --> 22:05.766
<i>Sonny, why you spend
all the time on the phone?</i>

22:05.808 --> 22:10.020
..."Blue Moon" Mendoza. Where do
guys come up with these names?

22:10.104 --> 22:12.523
Yeah. What,
you're kidding me?

22:13.023 --> 22:14.483
Yeah. Does he know
where to go?

22:14.650 --> 22:15.776
All right, good.

22:15.943 --> 22:18.320
Tony, how do you
catch cold in Miami?

22:20.364 --> 22:22.992
All right, Tony, yeah. Well,
listen, take care of yourself.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.953
And, Tony, stay out
of the snowstorms, will you?

22:27.329 --> 22:28.372
Sorry.

22:28.455 --> 22:29.707
Excuse me, honey.

22:29.915 --> 22:32.626
Would you care for some towels?

22:32.877 --> 22:33.919
Oh, yeah.

22:34.170 --> 22:35.504
Hey, this is a great hotel.

22:35.588 --> 22:36.922
Motel.

22:37.006 --> 22:38.132
Whatever.

22:38.382 --> 22:40.301
Yeah. Hey.

22:40.676 --> 22:43.053
When is that load
gonna get here?

22:43.554 --> 22:46.182
Noon? Well, yeah.
I hope so. Yeah.

22:46.348 --> 22:48.309
All right, listen. Take the
Hempstead Junction exit...

22:48.392 --> 22:49.810
use the back roads, will you?

22:50.352 --> 22:53.522
This rig doesn't get through
and get through safely...

22:53.606 --> 22:55.316
I'm gonna hear
all kinds of hell.

22:55.357 --> 22:56.901
I don't need it
from both ends...

22:56.984 --> 22:59.028
you know, so no surprises!

22:59.528 --> 23:03.199
Hey, could you do me up here, please?
Could you zip me up?

23:03.224 --> 23:04.200
Oh, yes.

23:04.283 --> 23:06.035
Look, anything
happens to this load...

23:06.118 --> 23:08.245
your head comes
in a hatbox, got that?

23:09.705 --> 23:12.124
I'm hungry, Sonny.

23:14.335 --> 23:17.796
Okay, honey. I gotta go make
a hit at this station...

23:17.880 --> 23:19.882
and then I come back to get you later.
Okay? What do you say?

23:19.965 --> 23:22.343
Hurry up, Sonny.
I'm hungry.

23:22.426 --> 23:24.303
All right. All right.

23:35.564 --> 23:36.815
Noon, huh?

23:36.899 --> 23:38.609
Route 116?

23:40.069 --> 23:42.821
Whatever Sonny's into has
got to be on those trucks.

23:42.905 --> 23:44.490
Hey, man, here he come.

23:57.419 --> 23:58.796
How you doing?

24:04.176 --> 24:07.471
Sonny Collins. In charge
of Octiline Petroleum.

24:07.554 --> 24:09.306
- I hear you've been looking for me.
- Yes, we have.

24:09.390 --> 24:11.100
Well, I'm here to apologize.

24:11.433 --> 24:12.810
I understand
there may have been...

24:12.851 --> 24:15.020
some less than ethical
business practice...

24:15.145 --> 24:16.438
and I wanna clear that up.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.399
Here's the contract
you wanted me to sign.

24:18.482 --> 24:20.859
Here it is, Sealed, delivered.
The place is yours.

24:20.901 --> 24:22.486
What about the other stations?

24:22.653 --> 24:25.197
Hey, pal,
just take what I give you.

24:25.739 --> 24:27.700
I'm afraid it's a package deal.

24:28.325 --> 24:29.827
Package deal, huh?

24:31.078 --> 24:33.414
Well, I'll have to give that
some thought. I...

24:35.040 --> 24:36.709
I'll get back to you
on that, okay?

24:54.643 --> 24:55.978
I don't get it.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.441
Well, he was too willing
to give in.

25:00.566 --> 25:02.693
He's gotta be working
on something bigger.

25:02.776 --> 25:05.404
Yeah, well, he gave us
what we wanted.

25:05.487 --> 25:06.905
He signed the papers.

25:07.156 --> 25:08.574
I don't know, Hannibal.

25:08.657 --> 25:11.118
I don't think we should
hit his load now, do you?

25:11.618 --> 25:13.329
- Of course not.
- No.

25:18.459 --> 25:20.419
I'm never gonna let
you use anything of mine again.

25:20.502 --> 25:22.504
You have no respect
for personal property.

25:22.588 --> 25:24.923
That's fine with me! I'm not
even gonna talk to you any more.

25:25.007 --> 25:27.217
- Yeah. Can I get that in writing?
- You could...

25:27.301 --> 25:29.094
You can get it in writing,
if you want.

25:29.178 --> 25:31.513
You bozos wanna get
this thing out of my way?

25:31.638 --> 25:34.141
Sure, wouldn't wanna
inconvenience you.

25:34.975 --> 25:37.561
Hi. Why don't you leave
the driving to us, eh?

25:37.770 --> 25:42.441
Now let's see what Sonny is trying
to bring into Green Tree Creek.

26:19.978 --> 26:23.212
It's furniture, Hannibal.
Just lots of furniture.

26:23.237 --> 26:27.277
Mostly 18th century English stuff,
I'd say, Sheraton and Hepplewhite.

26:34.368 --> 26:36.703
And I guess this is who owns it.

26:38.205 --> 26:41.291
Now, who does that look like?

26:45.462 --> 26:46.547
Sam Marlini.

26:46.672 --> 26:49.675
The biggest mobster
in Detroit. He's dead.

26:49.716 --> 26:52.177
Imagine him
about 28 years older...

26:52.302 --> 26:55.264
gray hair, lots of wrinkles...

26:56.056 --> 26:57.933
planting a bush.

26:58.016 --> 26:58.976
The gardener?

27:02.604 --> 27:05.315
Are we right?
I got nothing to say.

27:05.816 --> 27:07.526
Then you prove the point.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.406
This thing is getting
bigger and bigger, guys.

27:13.740 --> 27:15.492
I say we stay.

27:28.922 --> 27:30.174
Hey, Pop.

27:32.426 --> 27:33.552
Hey, Pop.

27:35.512 --> 27:36.638
Hey, Pop!

27:36.930 --> 27:40.017
I'm standing right here.
Why do you have to shout?

27:40.392 --> 27:43.812
I got us off the hook. I straightened
it out with the gas station.

27:43.937 --> 27:45.689
What do you mean,
"straightened it out"?

27:46.106 --> 27:47.483
Those were my deals.

27:47.524 --> 27:48.775
- Your deals?
- Yeah.

27:48.859 --> 27:50.611
Pop, we leave you
alone for a few days...

27:50.694 --> 27:54.072
you start shaking down
gas stations like it's 1946.

27:54.198 --> 27:56.074
I gotta have a little fun.

27:56.867 --> 27:58.243
Look, I'm bored.

27:58.327 --> 27:59.536
- You're bored?
- I'm bored.

27:59.620 --> 28:00.454
- You're bored?
- Bored.

28:00.537 --> 28:03.373
Pop, listen to me. I went through a
great deal of trouble, you know...

28:03.457 --> 28:05.918
to stage that accident with the prison bus.
You know that?

28:06.001 --> 28:07.794
You're supposed to be dead, Pop.

28:08.086 --> 28:10.631
You don't go around here
attracting attention.

28:10.839 --> 28:15.511
Look, I wouldn't be dead if you would
have whacked that judge like I told you.

28:15.594 --> 28:17.554
We don't whack judges these days, Pop.
You don't.

28:17.638 --> 28:19.890
No, we don't.
We send them to college.

28:20.307 --> 28:23.560
It was you that whacks a police
commissioner in broad daylight...

28:23.644 --> 28:25.771
at one of our own
shopping malls, yet.

28:26.772 --> 28:28.482
That had to be done.

28:30.192 --> 28:33.028
I don't know, Pop, sometimes
I'm beginning to think...

28:33.111 --> 28:35.113
you're getting senile.

28:40.077 --> 28:41.286
- Mr. Marlini.
- Yeah?

28:41.370 --> 28:44.706
I got food for 12 people. I got the
antipasto, I got the three pastas...

28:44.790 --> 28:46.250
I got the ossobuco milanese.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.335
Good, Gino! Hope everybody enjoys it.
Take care of it.

28:48.418 --> 28:49.836
How? How are they
gonna enjoy it?

28:49.920 --> 28:51.380
I got nothing to put it on...

28:51.463 --> 28:52.839
they got nothing
to eat it off of.

28:52.923 --> 28:55.801
I need plates, silver,
glasses for the <i>vino.</i>

28:55.926 --> 28:58.387
And we got no tables
or chairs, either.

28:58.470 --> 28:59.429
All right, Pop.

28:59.513 --> 29:03.433
So we set up a few folding tables,
a few folding chairs, okay?

29:03.600 --> 29:06.436
These are important people
with important businesses.

29:06.520 --> 29:09.231
How's it gonna look,
you got no chairs to sit on...

29:09.314 --> 29:10.482
no tables to eat off of?

29:10.566 --> 29:12.317
Enough about the furniture, Pop.

29:12.401 --> 29:15.362
How many times I got to tell you?
It's on its way. Okay?

29:15.445 --> 29:16.321
<i>Scusi.</i>

29:17.155 --> 29:18.991
There it is.
Right now.

29:36.633 --> 29:39.158
Mac! What happened?

29:39.197 --> 29:42.222
Those clowns from the station,
they ambushed the truck.

29:42.347 --> 29:45.601
My furniture?
What happened to my furniture?

29:45.684 --> 29:47.519
They got it,
Mr. Marlini.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.338
You hijacked
my father's furniture.

30:14.463 --> 30:15.922
And you want it back?

30:17.007 --> 30:20.135
Hear you're giving a party at your
dad's house for half the mob.

30:20.302 --> 30:22.471
What is it? Appalachia West?

30:22.554 --> 30:24.598
You don't know what you're
talking about, pal.

30:24.765 --> 30:28.644
You can have all the
towels you want.

30:28.727 --> 30:32.147
- Just don't steal any--
- Hey, what gives here?

30:33.690 --> 30:34.983
Wait a minute.

30:35.067 --> 30:38.070
You guys ain't cops. Why are
you sticking noses in this?

30:38.153 --> 30:40.322
We don't like scum like you
moving into the neighborhood.

30:40.364 --> 30:42.157
It ruins the property values.

30:42.282 --> 30:44.076
You stay out of this, pal.

30:47.371 --> 30:49.039
Let's talk about it, shall we?

30:49.498 --> 30:52.084
Now, why is the biggest
mobster in the country...

30:52.167 --> 30:54.336
relocating to Green Tree Creek?

30:56.296 --> 30:57.839
What's the story, Sonny?

30:58.006 --> 30:59.383
My father is retiring.

30:59.466 --> 31:02.886
What are they gonna do, give him a
gold watch for faithful service?

31:03.053 --> 31:05.472
My old man is dividing up
his holdings.

31:05.889 --> 31:06.890
They agree, okay.

31:06.973 --> 31:09.893
They don't, well, they
decide among themselves.

31:09.976 --> 31:11.978
I think we'd like to attend.

31:12.187 --> 31:13.939
Everybody knows everybody.

31:14.022 --> 31:15.816
That's not exactly accurate.

31:16.149 --> 31:18.568
Tony Balloons from Miami
has got the flu...

31:18.652 --> 31:20.570
and he's sending somebody
that nobody knows.

31:20.696 --> 31:24.866
Carlos "Blue Moon" Mendoza.

31:29.329 --> 31:30.580
Okay, Sonny...

31:31.623 --> 31:33.750
how do we find Mr. Mendoza?

31:39.548 --> 31:40.841
- Hi, there.
- Hello.

31:40.924 --> 31:42.634
- May I help you, sir?
- Do you have a reservation...

31:42.718 --> 31:45.470
for Carlos
Mendoza from Miami, Florida?

31:45.554 --> 31:47.723
Mendoza?
Let me see.

31:49.057 --> 31:51.560
Mendoza. Is that
with a "Z" or an "S"?

31:51.643 --> 31:52.519
With a "Z."

31:52.602 --> 31:53.562
"Z"?

31:55.355 --> 31:58.608
Here it is. Yes, Carlos
Mendoza, Miami, Florida.

32:01.153 --> 32:04.281
Here you are.
That's Room 211.

32:05.282 --> 32:06.116
Front!

32:06.199 --> 32:08.160
Gracias. Yes,
enjoy yourself, sir.

32:10.454 --> 32:12.164
- Follow me, sir.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

32:59.503 --> 33:02.255
Carlos Mendoza, Miami.

33:02.422 --> 33:05.342
Tony Balloons,
he sent me here to...

33:06.134 --> 33:07.219
To act for him.

33:07.302 --> 33:10.180
Did Tony give you
something for me?

33:10.931 --> 33:15.727
Well, that depends upon
who you are, old man.

33:15.811 --> 33:18.063
Sam Marlini, chico.

33:18.146 --> 33:22.359
Well, if you are
who you say you are...

33:22.526 --> 33:25.779
then this is for you.

33:30.325 --> 33:32.994
Okay, Mendoza...

33:33.245 --> 33:34.871
go inside
and get yourself a drink.

33:34.955 --> 33:36.748
Meeting starts
in a couple of minutes.

33:36.832 --> 33:41.605
That is Mendoza
with a "Z," not an "S".

33:41.660 --> 33:44.256
A "Z". And that gold coin?

33:44.381 --> 33:48.885
Tony said that I can show it to
you but not to let you keep it.

33:53.932 --> 33:55.433
I'm inside, Hannibal.

33:57.686 --> 34:01.022
<i>Señor</i>, yes, I will
have a <i>Cuba Libre, por favor.</i>

34:01.106 --> 34:02.232
So far, so good.

34:02.315 --> 34:05.151
I'm just glad Mendoza's
suit didn't fit me.

34:05.318 --> 34:06.486
Gotta hand it to Murdock...

34:06.570 --> 34:08.029
the fool's got a lot of guts.

34:08.321 --> 34:09.781
<i>This is Sheriff Plummer.</i>

34:09.864 --> 34:12.534
Come out with your hands up.
We've got you surrounded.

34:15.161 --> 34:16.996
You, all of you, freeze!

34:17.289 --> 34:19.541
Those are the wrong ones, Annie.

34:19.623 --> 34:21.877
It's the A-Team I want,
Zack. Come on.

34:22.918 --> 34:27.424
Get them out of there.
Search them, cuff them.

34:39.978 --> 34:42.355
You're making a big
mistake, Annie.

34:42.438 --> 34:45.108
I ran a fingerprint check on them.
They're the A-Team, all right.

34:45.984 --> 34:47.694
<i>Sorry, I don't know
what's keeping my son.</i>

34:47.777 --> 34:49.612
<i>So let's get on with business.</i>

34:49.779 --> 34:52.908
To those opposed
to Maury Goodman...

34:52.991 --> 34:56.161
taking over the southwest end
of town, advise.

34:56.453 --> 34:57.412
Huh?

35:00.749 --> 35:02.500
Okay, Moose.
You got it.

35:06.338 --> 35:10.342
And might I add, it couldn't
happen to a better guy.

35:12.344 --> 35:17.015
The East, I'd like to pass on
to my son Albert...

35:17.098 --> 35:19.517
who you know as Sonny. He does
all right with the numbers...

35:19.601 --> 35:24.606
and he's doing pretty good with the
bookies and I think he deserves it.

35:26.691 --> 35:28.318
Any objections?

35:32.864 --> 35:34.991
Finally, we come...

35:35.325 --> 35:38.787
to the North side.
This I'd like to pass on...

35:38.870 --> 35:42.040
to my good trusted friend...

35:42.499 --> 35:46.169
Tony Baloons.
Unfortunately, poor health...

35:46.252 --> 35:50.340
has prevented Tony from coming
here to make his case in person.

35:50.507 --> 35:55.720
In his place he sent one
Carlos Mendoza with a "Z".

35:55.971 --> 35:57.847
Stand up, Carlos, stand up.

35:58.598 --> 36:02.394
Let us hear what Tony
has in mind to do...

36:02.519 --> 36:04.020
with the North end of the town.

36:04.229 --> 36:06.314
Don't you think that first...

36:06.648 --> 36:08.733
that we should bow our heads...

36:08.900 --> 36:13.738
for a minute and pray for my
patrón, and your good friend...

36:14.072 --> 36:16.908
Tony Baloons,
for his speedy recovery?

36:35.969 --> 36:38.680
Okay. That's enough.

36:39.514 --> 36:44.019
Now let's see what Tony has in
mind to do with the North side?

36:45.061 --> 36:47.063
Sure. Sure.

36:48.231 --> 36:49.482
Sit down.

36:54.112 --> 36:56.406
Well, I mean, you know...

36:57.198 --> 36:58.158
Yeah.

36:59.617 --> 37:01.995
He, Tony, he sent me here...

37:03.163 --> 37:06.541
To reassure you, all of you...

37:06.708 --> 37:12.047
that he plans to make,
no big changes.

37:12.922 --> 37:16.384
You know,
maybe some little changes...

37:16.885 --> 37:21.890
maybe here, maybe there.
You know...

37:22.348 --> 37:27.645
you minimize the expenses,
and you maximize the profits.

37:28.354 --> 37:30.023
This guy is an imposter.

37:31.066 --> 37:32.358
A dead one.

37:37.864 --> 37:39.532
Before you shoot him...

37:40.742 --> 37:42.327
I want my suit back.

37:57.133 --> 37:59.344
Now, do you see why I asked
you to bring me out here?

37:59.511 --> 38:02.097
What am I gonna do? Arrest
them for illegal assembly?

38:03.598 --> 38:07.268
Those people control half
the mob in this country.

38:07.727 --> 38:09.187
If you don't try
to make an arrest...

38:09.270 --> 38:11.106
I don't know what you're
wearing a badge for.

38:12.524 --> 38:15.110
We don't stand a chance. They've
got an army down there.

38:15.819 --> 38:18.238
We could have an army out
here, if you'd let us help.

38:19.405 --> 38:20.782
The A-Team?

38:22.117 --> 38:23.284
But first...

38:24.494 --> 38:26.412
I've got to get one of
my people out of there.

38:33.002 --> 38:36.131
Look, I think you guys are
overreacting to all this.

38:36.297 --> 38:37.757
I mean, I'm just an actor.

38:37.841 --> 38:39.384
I'm telling you, I'm unemployed.

38:39.467 --> 38:41.302
I don't have any money.
This guy comes up to me...

38:41.386 --> 38:43.221
and pays me good
to come here to say--

38:43.346 --> 38:44.681
Shut up!

38:44.806 --> 38:47.517
Shut up. Shut up. That's a silly
thing to say to an actor.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.769
I mean, there's two words I don't
even know the meaning of, "shut"...

38:49.853 --> 38:51.396
You open your mouth
one more time...

38:51.421 --> 38:53.439
I put your head in a box
and mail it somewhere.

38:55.024 --> 38:57.652
Trip's over. Hold it.
Drop those guns.

38:57.735 --> 38:59.362
Colonel, thank God.

39:00.697 --> 39:03.825
Move it back this way.
Come on, move it.

39:04.784 --> 39:06.035
Open the trunk.

39:10.999 --> 39:12.125
In.

39:12.250 --> 39:13.626
You're buying your own funeral.

39:13.835 --> 39:15.378
Save it. In.

39:21.968 --> 39:23.469
Take a deep breath.

39:38.776 --> 39:41.237
It's getting late.
I don't like it, Face.

39:41.321 --> 39:42.906
If he was on it,
he would have...

39:43.865 --> 39:44.949
Called?

39:49.537 --> 39:50.246
Yeah.

39:50.330 --> 39:52.207
Jim, Sheriff Plummer.

39:52.457 --> 39:54.626
Turn them loose and help
them do whatever they want.

39:54.667 --> 39:57.170
And Smith says to tell
his people to build it.

39:57.462 --> 39:58.755
We're on our way.

39:59.005 --> 40:02.425
You're free. And Smith's
orders is to build it?

40:02.675 --> 40:03.968
Whatever that means.

40:04.177 --> 40:06.137
That means he's on the jazz.

41:07.949 --> 41:11.619
Hello, could you get Sam
on the phone, please?

41:11.786 --> 41:13.162
It's an urgent call.

41:13.788 --> 41:14.789
Thank you.

41:15.290 --> 41:16.124
Yeah?

41:16.207 --> 41:18.835
Samuel! Hannibal Smith here.

41:19.752 --> 41:21.129
I'm just calling
to let you know...

41:21.212 --> 41:23.131
we've got your furniture
and your fancy car...

41:23.214 --> 41:24.799
<i>at Zack's gas station.</i>

41:24.882 --> 41:26.426
<i>Thought you might
wanna make a deal.</i>

41:26.509 --> 41:28.261
Sure, we'll make a deal.

41:29.178 --> 41:30.930
You get my stuff back...

41:31.014 --> 41:34.142
<i>or I'll leave your bones
to bleach in the sun.</i>

41:35.101 --> 41:37.270
That whole family is so moody.

41:39.147 --> 41:41.357
Get all the boys together.

41:42.525 --> 41:44.610
I'm gonna pay
that station a visit.

42:21.356 --> 42:25.485
Hey, that's my mantle
from my house in Westport.

42:25.568 --> 42:28.905
You're gonna leave my friends
alone and buzz off, Sam.

42:28.988 --> 42:32.617
I'm gonna take you
and your people...

42:32.784 --> 42:34.660
and cut them up
into little pieces.

42:34.786 --> 42:36.287
Beat it, slimeball.

42:36.371 --> 42:37.455
Right. Go.

42:42.210 --> 42:43.795
Let them have it, Murdock.

44:28.816 --> 44:32.820
Hey, who are you?
One of the families?

44:33.321 --> 44:36.866
Something like that.
We're a team.

44:44.040 --> 44:45.750
You've got to be real careful.

44:45.875 --> 44:47.418
<i>I won this
on the Wheel of Fortune.</i>

44:47.501 --> 44:48.502
Are you sure?

44:48.586 --> 44:50.880
You're sure you got all of the
old oil out of there, right?

44:50.922 --> 44:51.714
Uh-huh.

44:51.797 --> 44:54.091
And you're gonna put the
proper weight and grade oil...

44:54.133 --> 44:55.593
back in there? Right?
- Uh-huh.

44:55.718 --> 44:58.763
And you made sure that oil
plug is tight, right?

44:58.846 --> 44:59.889
Uh-huh.

45:00.014 --> 45:01.766
Hey, Murdock.
Leave the kid alone.

45:01.849 --> 45:03.893
You're doing just fine,
Kelvin. Just fine.

45:03.976 --> 45:07.271
B.A., what are you think? Do you think that
the truck needs another coat of paint?

45:07.355 --> 45:10.274
You know, along the door,
where it was scraped?

45:10.483 --> 45:11.525
Murdock!

45:13.819 --> 45:14.904
Colonel Smith, I'm sure wish...

45:14.987 --> 45:16.113
you'd let me
and the other owners...

45:16.197 --> 45:17.782
pay you a little something
for your trouble.

45:17.990 --> 45:19.116
Yeah. No, no.

45:19.200 --> 45:21.869
We wouldn't dream of
accepting any money for it.

45:22.119 --> 45:24.956
After all,
virtue is its own reward.

45:25.373 --> 45:26.707
Isn't that right, Colonel?

45:26.874 --> 45:27.792
Well said, Lieutenant.

45:27.875 --> 45:30.753
<i>The army has requested
an APB be issued for the A-Team...</i>

45:30.836 --> 45:32.630
<i>after Sheriff Plummer
reported their escape.</i>

45:32.713 --> 45:34.382
Hannibal!
We better get out of here.

45:34.548 --> 45:36.259
The army's just put out
an APB on us.

45:36.300 --> 45:37.635
Let's go, Murdock.

45:37.802 --> 45:39.845
No, no. I'm staying here
with this truck.

45:40.096 --> 45:41.764
You go on ahead.
I'll catch up to you.

45:42.848 --> 45:45.726
I'm done, Mr. Murdock.
I'll let her down now.

45:46.227 --> 45:50.398
No, no. I'll do it.
I'll do it myself.
