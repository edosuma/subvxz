<i>Amy: Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:05.588 --> 00:07.716
- Oh no, what happened?
- He just pulled up lame.

00:07.757 --> 00:09.426
- What'd Cass say?

00:09.467 --> 00:11.636
- He strained his suspensory
ligament.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.764
- I am humbled to announce,
by way of acclimation,

00:14.806 --> 00:17.475
I will be your next mayor!
(Booing)

00:17.517 --> 00:19.436
- 'Scuse me! Stop! Excuse me!

00:19.477 --> 00:23.273
And I, too, will be running
to be your next mayor

00:23.314 --> 00:24.858
of Hudson.
(Cheering)

00:24.899 --> 00:27.444
- What I want is to be here
with you a little longer.

00:27.485 --> 00:28.903
I mean, this could be
something, Georgie.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.197
- This is why I said goodbye
in Europe.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.949
- You ready?
- Yeah.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.784
You've picked Atlas?
Good choice.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.745
- My doctor actually says that

00:36.786 --> 00:39.497
I'm ready to leave
the facility now.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.499
- I don't think you should rush
into anything.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.084
Luke can stay here as long as--

00:43.126 --> 00:45.295
<i>- Yeah, thank you,</i>
<i>but Luke belongs with me.</i>

00:45.337 --> 00:46.755
And the sooner that
we're back together,

00:46.796 --> 00:48.548
the sooner we can all
move on with our lives.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.846
**

00:54.888 --> 00:56.765
(Engine rumbles)

00:59.476 --> 01:01.436
(Machinery rumbles)

01:01.478 --> 01:03.438
(Distant shouting)

01:09.778 --> 01:11.613
(Distant chatter)

01:13.615 --> 01:15.450
(Machinery rumbles)

01:16.910 --> 01:18.453
(Wolf growls)

01:19.788 --> 01:21.664
(Laughter)
- Back up!

01:21.706 --> 01:23.375
- Come on!
Both: (Laughing)

01:23.416 --> 01:24.751
Come on!
(Loud splat)

01:24.793 --> 01:27.170
- Oh-ho-ho-ho! (Laughing)
- (Laughing)

01:27.212 --> 01:28.421
(Hard thwap)
Oh!

01:28.463 --> 01:30.006
- Yeah!
- (Laughing)

01:30.048 --> 01:32.050
- Can you get the bubbles?
- You want some of this?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.594
- Oh!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, okay!

01:34.636 --> 01:37.180
Both: (Laughing)
- I'll get you! Ha-ha!

01:37.222 --> 01:39.349
- You guys! (Laughs)

01:39.391 --> 01:41.309
- Hey! Well, this looks
like fun.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.353
- (Laughs) Come on in.
There's plenty of room.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.979
- Uh, I'd love to,
but I just came to ask

01:45.021 --> 01:46.564
if you wanted me to take
Spartan for a walk.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.817
- Oh, I would like to.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.610
Um, but you can come with me
if you want.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.655
I'd like the company.
- Yeah. Sure, sounds good.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.407
- Are you good with these guys?
- Yeah, yeah, I got this.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.658
- 'Kay.
Luke: Uh, Georgie,

01:56.700 --> 01:58.451
uh, can you take a picture
of us first?

01:58.493 --> 01:59.911
- Yeah, sure.
- Awesome! Thanks.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.789
- Okay, picture time!

02:02.831 --> 02:03.915
'Kay, come on, Lyndy!
- All right...

02:03.957 --> 02:05.667
- All right!
- Ready?

02:05.709 --> 02:07.460
- Ready? One...
- Smile!

02:07.502 --> 02:08.752
- Two, three!
(Shutter snaps)

02:08.794 --> 02:10.797
Cheese!

02:10.839 --> 02:11.840
- Are you smiling?
- Are you smiling?

02:11.881 --> 02:13.717
- Are you smiling? (Laughing)
(Shutter snaps)

02:13.758 --> 02:17.470
**

02:17.512 --> 02:19.931
- So you know that horse
Jade was riding - Atlas?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.976
- Yeah.
- Isn't he beautiful?

02:23.018 --> 02:24.894
I just think,
with the right owner,

02:24.936 --> 02:27.731
he could do pretty much
anything.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.733
- And I bet Lisa would sell him
for next to nothing

02:29.774 --> 02:31.526
if she knew he was going
to the right home.

02:31.568 --> 02:32.652
- Why do I get the feeling

02:32.694 --> 02:34.487
like you're trying to pitch me
on that horse?

02:34.529 --> 02:35.947
- No, it... it's not that.
It's just...

02:35.989 --> 02:37.824
- (Sighs)

02:37.866 --> 02:39.784
- Horses like Atlas don't come
around that often,

02:39.826 --> 02:41.828
and when I saw him at Fairfield,

02:41.870 --> 02:44.622
I thought he'd be perfect
for you.

02:44.664 --> 02:46.708
I get that Spartan's your main
guy, but...

02:46.750 --> 02:49.044
- But?

02:49.085 --> 02:50.670
- But he's not as young
as he used to be.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.966
And now that he's injured,
I think having another horse

02:55.008 --> 02:56.676
could take the pressure off him
a little bit.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.428
- You know, I get what you're
saying, Georgie,

02:58.470 --> 03:00.513
but Spartan's fine.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.724
I'm not ready to put him
out to pasture just yet.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.809
(Spartan grunts nervously)

03:04.851 --> 03:06.061
Ho, ho...
(Spartan whinnies)

03:06.102 --> 03:08.438
Whoa, you're okay.
(Grunting nervously)

03:08.480 --> 03:10.732
Easy... hey, you're fine.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.485
- What was that?
- I don't know.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.903
We should probably
get him home though.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.655
(Growling)

03:17.697 --> 03:19.407
- Amy.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.326
(Growling)

03:22.786 --> 03:24.871
(Growling)

03:24.913 --> 03:26.664
- Just stay calm.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.333
(Vicious snarling and growling)

03:29.834 --> 03:36.800
**

03:36.841 --> 03:45.350
**

03:45.392 --> 03:47.686
* And at the break of day *

03:47.727 --> 03:51.356
* You sank into your dream *

03:52.649 --> 03:54.067
* You dreamer *

03:54.109 --> 03:54.776
* Oh, oh, oh, oh... *

03:56.611 --> 03:58.405
* You dreamer *

04:00.657 --> 04:04.285
* You dreamer *

04:10.083 --> 04:12.377
(Snarling and barking)

04:12.419 --> 04:13.920
- What do we do?

04:13.962 --> 04:16.172
(Wolf barks and snarls)

04:16.214 --> 04:19.134
- Just... just back away slowly.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.760
Don't make any sudden moves.

04:23.888 --> 04:24.806
(Barking and snarling)

04:28.810 --> 04:30.562
- It's pretty unusual
to see a wolf like that.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.063
- Yeah, we could've died.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.565
- (Amused chuckle)

04:33.606 --> 04:35.817
Actually, wolf attacks
are extremely rare.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.111
They normally like to keep
their distance from humans.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.238
If it was a cougar
on the other hand,

04:40.280 --> 04:41.698
I'd be a lot more worried.
They attack from above,

04:41.740 --> 04:43.658
so you don't see it coming.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.201
- Well, that's reassuring,
isn't it?

04:45.243 --> 04:48.329
- (Sighs) How is Spartan doing?

04:48.371 --> 04:50.874
- He's good. The swelling's
come down quite a bit.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.251
- Okay. I think he's bored
of being hand walked.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.836
I was hoping maybe I could
ride him tomorrow?

04:56.588 --> 04:58.214
- I don't see why not.

04:58.256 --> 05:01.551
- 'Kay. I just don't wanna
re-injure him.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.803
- I know.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.056
He is showing some signs
of arthritis,

05:06.097 --> 05:07.807
but if you take it easy,
I think it should be fine.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.895
I should go. I gotta help Scott
at the clinic today, okay?

05:11.936 --> 05:13.021
- Okay.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.191
Oh, Ty, don't forget

05:16.232 --> 05:18.651
we have that meeting
with Clint tonight.

05:18.693 --> 05:19.819
- Right. See you later.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.530
- (Sighs)

05:24.574 --> 05:25.533
You're a good boy.

05:27.369 --> 05:30.455
- Okay, tomorrow at nine
you're meeting with the HSBA.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.165
- HSBA.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.292
That's the Hudson Small
Business Association, right?

05:34.334 --> 05:38.129
- Right. And then after that
you're meeting with the HMTA.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.964
- HMTA. I don't know that one.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.092
- The Hudson Model Train
Association.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.802
You need all the votes
you can get, honey.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.261
You're still ten points
behind J.D.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.305
- Well, I was fifteen
last week.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.599
- That doesn't mean we can
become complacent, Lou.

05:49.641 --> 05:50.975
You still have to be
campaigning every day.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.519
You can't be out here...

05:52.560 --> 05:54.479
picking garbage up in an alley.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.897
- I have no choice, all right?

05:55.939 --> 05:57.524
An animal got into
the bins last night.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.025
<i>Jack: Lou, let me help ya.</i>

05:59.067 --> 06:01.820
- Here.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.155
- Why don't you pitch in
instead of doing nothing?

06:04.197 --> 06:06.032
- I'm not doing nothing.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.284
I'm campaign managing,
which is pretty obvious.

06:08.326 --> 06:11.037
- I don't know why you would
ask him to do that.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.164
- Because I'm the obvious
choice, Jack.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.874
I'm the only one in the family
with experience

06:14.916 --> 06:17.043
in the election process, right?

06:17.085 --> 06:19.337
Remember "Time for Tim"?
- Yeah, I do.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.798
And as I recall,
it wasn't "Time for Tim".

06:21.840 --> 06:23.216
<i>- Well, that's beside</i>
<i>the point.</i>

06:23.258 --> 06:26.261
- He's doing a great job,
and he's doing it for free,

06:26.302 --> 06:28.805
which is about all I can afford.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.306
- Yeah, well, keeping Werth
out of office,

06:30.348 --> 06:32.017
that's payment enough for me.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.185
I didn't invest in half
of this restaurant

06:34.227 --> 06:37.272
to have him come along
and put us out of business.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.315
Now, let's go over
next week's schedule.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.736
- Okay.
- You have a meet and greet

06:42.777 --> 06:45.030
at the old folk's home
on Tuesday afternoon.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.781
Oh, and good news, they're
gonna let you call bingo.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.909
- Why do you wanna bring
Atlas here?

06:49.951 --> 06:53.079
- So that Amy can ride him.
- Mm-hmm?

06:53.121 --> 06:55.123
How does Amy feel about you
playing horse matchmaker?

06:55.165 --> 06:58.084
- Well, she's reluctant.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.836
- I thought so.
Your Grampa was the same

06:59.878 --> 07:01.671
when Paint started
slowing down.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.882
- Exactly! And that's why
I wanna help her.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.301
I think I can make this
a lot easier for Amy.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.303
I know Spartan's got a lot
of good years left,

07:08.345 --> 07:10.680
he just... can't do all the same
stuff he used to.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.849
- I know. If you bring Atlas
to Heartland,

07:12.891 --> 07:15.060
you have to tread lightly.
You of all people

07:15.101 --> 07:17.270
know that Spartan's more
than a horse to Amy.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.898
- Does that mean I have
your permission?

07:19.939 --> 07:21.358
- Yes, you have my permission,

07:21.399 --> 07:23.109
but I would lower
your expectations.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.361
Because I don't think Amy
is ready

07:24.402 --> 07:26.488
to have a new horse
in her life.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.785
(Low hum of chatter,
music plays)

07:31.826 --> 07:33.536
- Well, if it isn't
my favourite ranching family

07:33.578 --> 07:35.330
from Hudson.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.040
- Well, probably won't be
for long

07:37.082 --> 07:38.249
after Lou beats you
in the election.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.126
- Well, I like your spirit, Tim.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.337
I hear you're managing
Lou's campaign.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.090
- You heard right.
- It's nice to see that Lou

07:45.131 --> 07:47.050
has so much support
from her family.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.968
Of course, to win,
you're gonna need

07:49.010 --> 07:50.845
support from the community,
something you're lacking,

07:50.887 --> 07:52.222
according to the latest polls.

07:52.263 --> 07:55.141
- Well, actually, I'm up
from last week, so...

07:55.183 --> 07:57.102
I guess that means
you're down.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.104
- There's always
a little excitement

07:59.145 --> 08:01.940
when a new candidate
enters the race.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.442
Kinda like buying
a brand new car.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.778
Problem is, a few weeks
into campaigning

08:06.820 --> 08:08.947
tends to dent the bumper,

08:08.988 --> 08:10.824
dull the shine a little.

08:10.865 --> 08:13.326
Pretty soon, no one's excited
about that brand new car.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.829
<i>- Okay...</i>

08:15.870 --> 08:18.039
Let's go, Tim,
before this car metaphor

08:18.081 --> 08:20.166
turns into something else.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.876
- Thanks.
- Bye, Dad.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.547
- Good people those two.
Salt of the earth.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.300
- Is there something I can do
for you, J.D.?

08:29.342 --> 08:32.053
- Well, I just came by to
congratulate you in person

08:32.095 --> 08:34.014
on officially entering
the race.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.890
- Thank you.
- You know, believe me,

08:35.932 --> 08:38.476
I know how challenging it is
to enter public life.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.062
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for my wife Diane.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.815
She is a, a true angel

08:43.857 --> 08:46.276
raising little Harper and Max.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.902
When I think of the million
things that she does every day:

08:47.944 --> 08:49.362
taking them to school,

08:49.404 --> 08:51.281
dropping them off
at soccer practice,

08:51.322 --> 08:53.116
baking the homemade
chocolate croissants

08:53.158 --> 08:54.868
for the church fundraiser -

08:54.909 --> 08:56.536
that woman does not rest.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.706
- I have met Diane
and she seems lovely.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.499
- She is. She's the only reason

09:01.541 --> 09:04.044
I even thought about running
for mayor.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.962
It gives me great comfort
to know

09:06.004 --> 09:07.672
that Diane is with
our children,

09:07.714 --> 09:09.215
even when I can't be.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.926
Unfortunately,
the reality of being mayor

09:11.968 --> 09:14.554
is time away from loved ones.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.806
Being a mother, you must worry
about what effect

09:16.848 --> 09:18.308
that it'll have on
your children,

09:18.350 --> 09:21.144
especially with no father
in the picture.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.271
- My children have a father.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.940
- Lives in Vancouver,
doesn't he?

09:25.982 --> 09:28.193
- Listen, J.D. um,

09:28.234 --> 09:31.112
you're not the first person
to throw my divorce in my face.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.114
And you're certainly not
the first person to suggest

09:33.156 --> 09:35.992
that my ambition beyond
soccer practice and bake sales

09:36.034 --> 09:38.203
<i>makes me a bad mother.</i>

09:38.244 --> 09:40.497
So, if you're trying
to get under my skin,

09:40.538 --> 09:42.499
you're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.876
- You got me all wrong, Lou.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.253
I get that to be successful,
you, uh,

09:47.295 --> 09:49.005
you have to make sacrifices.
- Thanks.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.466
- I just,
I hate to see kids suffer

09:51.508 --> 09:54.135
when their mothers aren't
in the picture.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.929
- You know, here I was

09:55.970 --> 09:57.639
thinking you were just
a real estate developer.

09:57.681 --> 10:00.850
Turns out you're an expert
on motherhood as well!

10:00.892 --> 10:02.519
Obviously, something I know
nothing about.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.230
I guess I just needed a man
to explain it to me.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.065
So thank you.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.942
- Now, now, Lou,

10:08.983 --> 10:10.443
I'd hoped to keep things
cordial between the two of us.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.195
- Oh, this is me being cordial.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.530
So you might wanna leave
my diner

10:13.571 --> 10:15.657
before I stop being polite.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.619
- (Clears his throat)

10:23.248 --> 10:25.166
- You have a great day now.
- (Chuckles)

10:31.006 --> 10:32.966
- He's pretty great, huh?

10:33.008 --> 10:35.260
I see hundreds of horses
at Fairfield every day

10:35.301 --> 10:37.387
and a lot of them are talented,

10:37.429 --> 10:39.514
but they're head strong
and hot tempered.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.433
Or the ones that are really
nice and sweet

10:41.474 --> 10:43.518
are usually pretty lazy
when it comes to the work.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.229
Atlas is the full package:
he's beautiful,

10:46.271 --> 10:48.773
strong, fast, athletic,

10:48.815 --> 10:50.358
and good natured.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.819
He's everything you could ask
for in a horse.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.779
- That's quite the sales pitch.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.656
- Thanks! Did it work?

10:58.366 --> 11:01.161
- He is beautiful, Georgie,
but I'm not in the market.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.871
- Well, I think if you took him
for a ride,

11:02.912 --> 11:04.330
you'd see what I'm talking
about.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.083
- Georgie, I need you to stop,
okay?

11:07.125 --> 11:08.877
I think your heart's in
the right place, but...

11:08.918 --> 11:10.795
I'm not ready.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.049
<i>(Phone rings)</i>

11:15.842 --> 11:18.178
Hey, Ty.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.220
How many?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.265
- Here I got him.
- That's terrible.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.184
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.394
No, thanks for letting me know.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.230
Okay, I love you too. Bye.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.899
- Is everything okay?

11:30.940 --> 11:33.360
- No. We should find Remi.
- Why, what's wrong?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.362
- Well, Ty's been treating
injured animals all day.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.238
He said there's a cougar
and more than one wolf

11:37.280 --> 11:39.157
in the area. We should probably
get Remi inside.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.241
- Yeah, okay.

11:41.576 --> 11:43.119
- (Nervous whine)

11:43.161 --> 11:44.412
<i>(Birds chirp)</i>

11:46.373 --> 11:48.124
(Barking)

11:48.166 --> 11:49.501
- What is it, Remi?
(Remi barks)

11:49.542 --> 11:51.670
- Remi, shush!
I'm trying to read.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.588
<i>(Barking)</i>
<i>What's her problem?</i>

11:53.630 --> 11:55.340
- I don't know,
but she must smell something.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.342
Remi!

11:57.384 --> 11:58.760
(Low growling)

12:00.470 --> 12:02.013
(Barking)
Remi!

12:02.055 --> 12:03.765
- Remi!
- Girl, come back!

12:05.558 --> 12:06.851
Come here, girl!

12:08.311 --> 12:10.021
<i>- You want wine with dinner?</i>

12:11.898 --> 12:14.275
Lise?
- (Gasps)

12:14.317 --> 12:16.444
- Would you like wine
with dinner?

12:16.486 --> 12:20.156
- Yup. Yeah, lots of wine.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.033
In fact, I'll have
a glass right now.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.206
(Sighs)
- Is everything all right?

12:28.248 --> 12:31.042
- Yeah, just another
Fairfield issue.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.045
Nothing to worry about.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.424
- I'll do that.
- It's okay, I got it.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.092
- No, I'll do it.
- I got it!

12:39.134 --> 12:42.262
- (Sighs) If something's
bothering you,

12:42.303 --> 12:43.680
I wouldn't mind knowing
about it.

12:43.722 --> 12:46.391
- (Sighs) If I tell you,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.143
you have to keep it
between the two of us.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.228
Lou especially cannot know.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.646
- I'm not gonna tell anybody,

12:51.688 --> 12:54.357
but what's Fairfield
got to do with Lou?

12:54.399 --> 12:57.027
- So, you remember that I was
having some cashflow issues

12:57.068 --> 12:58.653
with my business.
- Yeah.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.239
- I brought in some investors
to bridge the gap

13:01.281 --> 13:04.117
and... one of them is
Werth Developments.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.410
- (Sighs)

13:05.452 --> 13:06.703
- It's a small investment,

13:06.745 --> 13:08.663
but now, his lawyers
are telling me

13:08.705 --> 13:10.749
that I have to repay it
in full.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.501
- Can they do that?
- No. Not unless they can prove

13:13.543 --> 13:15.170
that I am mismanaging
my company,

13:15.211 --> 13:16.588
which, of course, I'm not.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.007
- Well, what're you gonna do?

13:19.049 --> 13:21.217
- If I fight it,
I waste money on lawyers.

13:21.259 --> 13:23.386
I wanna just repay him,

13:23.428 --> 13:25.847
but the truth is, I don't know
if I can actually afford it.

13:25.889 --> 13:28.350
(Approaching footsteps)
- Have you guys seen Rem?

13:28.391 --> 13:30.060
- No, she's not in here,
but Katie and Luke,

13:30.101 --> 13:31.519
they're playing in
the treehouse.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.146
<i>She might be out there.</i>
<i>Amy: Okay, thanks.</i>

13:35.482 --> 13:37.859
(Birds chirp)

13:40.111 --> 13:41.988
- Katie?!
- Luke!

13:42.030 --> 13:43.323
- (Sighs) Where are they?

13:44.532 --> 13:46.659
- Come on, Rem! Let's go.

13:46.701 --> 13:49.162
Come on!
Georgie: There they are.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.039
Rem! (Whistles) Come! Let's go!

13:51.081 --> 13:52.540
- Hey, you guys!
- Come on, Rem!

13:52.582 --> 13:54.376
- We were looking for you.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.669
Come on,
we should get you inside.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.462
- Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.464
- Wait. What do you mean?
Why do we have to go inside?

13:59.506 --> 14:00.882
- I'll explain on the way.
Come on, let's go.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.221
(Screen door creaks)

14:08.390 --> 14:09.599
- (Chuckles)
- Thanks.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.434
- Yeah.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.853
- (Sighs) I appreciate you guys
making time for me today.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.731
- Yeah, of course.
Is everything okay?

14:16.773 --> 14:19.067
- Yeah. Yeah, it is. Um...

14:20.819 --> 14:22.570
You know, as a matter of fact,
I have some good news.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.408
Luke's mom...

14:26.449 --> 14:28.284
she's been making
some amazing progress

14:28.326 --> 14:30.036
these past few months.

14:30.078 --> 14:32.247
She's got a good job,
a new apartment.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.249
But more importantly,
all of her doctors

14:34.290 --> 14:36.418
are satisfied that she's
at a point right now

14:36.459 --> 14:39.671
where she can go back
to parenting full time.

14:39.713 --> 14:43.091
So what I'd like to do

14:43.133 --> 14:45.051
is move Luke back in
with Andrea

14:45.093 --> 14:46.428
as soon as possible.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.437
Yeah, I know,
it's a lot to take in.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.399
You know I wouldn't be
doing this

14:59.441 --> 15:02.110
if I didn't think it was
the right thing for Luke.

15:02.152 --> 15:04.279
- Of course.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.656
We knew this was temporary

15:06.698 --> 15:09.284
from the beginning, so...

15:09.325 --> 15:11.494
It's just Luke's,
you know, he's...

15:11.536 --> 15:12.912
become a part of our family

15:14.497 --> 15:16.583
and uh... you know.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.835
- Yeah.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.462
You've made a wonderful home
for him here.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.965
I know this isn't easy.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.596
- You said as soon as possible.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.264
What does that mean?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.393
- This weekend? Really?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.187
- Yeah, Clint is gonna pick
you up

15:37.228 --> 15:39.189
and drop you off at your mom's.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.232
- That's so amazing!

15:41.274 --> 15:42.942
I know it might be late,
but would it be okay

15:42.984 --> 15:45.236
if I call my mom?
- Oh yeah, of course.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.988
- Yes!

15:51.618 --> 15:53.620
But I'll see you guys again,
right?

15:53.661 --> 15:56.081
And Lyndy and Jack...
and everyone?

15:57.582 --> 16:00.168
- Absolutely. You can come
and visit anytime.

16:01.544 --> 16:04.381
- But I won't live here
anymore.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.341
Remi will have to find
somewhere else

16:06.383 --> 16:08.301
to sleep at night.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.553
- That may be true,

16:10.595 --> 16:12.681
but you can come back
and see her anytime.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.227
- Will she remember me?

16:17.268 --> 16:19.646
- (Chuckles)
Of course she will.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.481
Remi never forgets a friend.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.360
- Isn't that right, Remi?
(Dialing beeps)

16:29.656 --> 16:31.366
- Hi, mom.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.368
I just heard. I can't wait!

16:35.578 --> 16:37.789
Okay. I'm gonna start
packing tomorrow.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.166
<i>Okay. Bye, Mom. Love you!</i>

16:40.208 --> 16:41.209
(Phone beeps off)

16:45.880 --> 16:47.382
(Horse nickers)

16:50.218 --> 16:52.012
(Lou sighs heavily)

16:55.432 --> 16:56.683
(Knocking)

16:58.226 --> 17:00.520
- Hey!
- Hey!

17:00.562 --> 17:02.981
- What a surprise!
- Mm.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.108
- Hey, I wasn't expecting
to see you.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.901
- Hmm.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.737
- How long do I have you for?

17:08.778 --> 17:10.155
- Couple of days.
- Yeah?

17:10.195 --> 17:12.824
- Yup. I just hired somebody
new at Aspen Grove to help out.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.701
- Really?

17:14.742 --> 17:16.536
- Yeah. Well, they're a little
green,

17:16.578 --> 17:18.413
so I can't leave 'em alone
for that long.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.914
- Well, we'll make the most
of our time.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.833
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm sure I can

17:21.875 --> 17:24.210
move some stuff around.
- Oh yeah?

17:24.252 --> 17:26.087
What, what kind of stuff?

17:26.128 --> 17:28.798
- Well, I'm in the middle
of an election, so...

17:28.840 --> 17:31.509
- Yeah, that, that election.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.095
Kinda came out of left field,
huh, you running for mayor?

17:34.137 --> 17:35.847
- Well, I told you,
I couldn't just let J.D. win

17:35.889 --> 17:37.515
without a fight.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.975
- Yeah, I understand that,
I just wish

17:39.017 --> 17:41.019
that I was part of that
decision.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.854
I hear some couples even talk
about these big life changes

17:42.896 --> 17:44.481
with each other.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.316
- Well, I don't remember
you telling me

17:46.358 --> 17:47.984
about turning our vacation
property

17:48.026 --> 17:49.736
into a working cattle ranch.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.863
- Lou, you were part of that
decision.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.698
- No, you told me about it
after the fact.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.325
It's not the same thing.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.077
- Okay, look,
I had to act fast,

17:57.118 --> 17:58.661
otherwise I would've lost
the opportunity.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.497
- Well, I had to act
quickly too.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.957
I'm sorry I didn't have time
to ask for your permission.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.377
- Hold--This is not
about asking permission.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.045
- Then what is it about?

18:07.087 --> 18:09.422
- It's about the fact that you
announced to the entire town

18:09.464 --> 18:11.424
that you're running for mayor
before you told your boyfriend.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.635
That's what it's about!

18:13.677 --> 18:15.512
<i>- Mommy?</i>

18:15.553 --> 18:17.639
- Hey, Honey,

18:17.681 --> 18:19.766
what're you, what're you
doing out here? You okay?

18:19.808 --> 18:22.560
- I had a bad dream.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.312
Hey, Mitch.
- Hey, Katie.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.315
Um, I'm gonna take off.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.027
- Can I sleep in your room
tonight?

18:31.069 --> 18:33.655
- Yeah, sweetie.
(Light kiss)

18:33.697 --> 18:35.323
Come here.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.411
(Birds chirp)

18:39.452 --> 18:42.163
- Oh, look.
Lou's up a few points.

18:42.205 --> 18:45.959
- Oh! I bet that J.D. Werth,
he's not so confident now.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.460
- Mm.
(Screen door snaps shut)

18:47.502 --> 18:49.004
- Morning.
- Hi.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.505
- Hey, Lou,
take a look at this.

18:50.547 --> 18:53.341
- Good news, eh?
- Yeah, I saw that. It's great.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.176
- So you left early
this morning.

18:55.218 --> 18:57.762
- I had to meet the health
inspector down at the diner.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.140
Apparently, somebody made
a complaint

19:00.181 --> 19:02.058
about the cleanliness
of our kitchen.

19:02.100 --> 19:05.603
- You're kidding.
- Yeah. I mean, we passed,

19:05.645 --> 19:07.814
but I sure would like to know
who filed the complaint.

19:07.856 --> 19:09.941
(Screen door snaps shut)
- Hey.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.943
Look what I got in the mail
this morning.

19:11.985 --> 19:15.113
It's a letter from the Hudson
County bylaw enforcement.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.323
Apparently, there's a law that
says you can't live in an RV

19:17.365 --> 19:19.075
for more than six months,

19:19.117 --> 19:21.453
even if it's on private
property.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.788
- What? You haven't
been there that long.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.041
- The complaint was lodged
by a "private citizen,"

19:26.082 --> 19:27.959
and if I don't move the RV,

19:28.001 --> 19:29.836
they're gonna charge you
a big fine.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.880
- Yeah, we'll see about that.
- Who even knows I live there,

19:31.921 --> 19:34.424
other than Lee the contractor?
Or maybe Sam next door?

19:34.466 --> 19:35.925
- Well, the timing
is pretty interesting.

19:35.967 --> 19:38.428
- What do you mean?

19:38.470 --> 19:39.846
- A "private citizen"
made the complaint

19:39.888 --> 19:42.474
to the health department
about the diner this morning.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.976
But maybe it's just
a coincidence.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.771
- Yeah, maybe it's J.D. Werth.
I'm just saying.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.981
- We shouldn't jump
to conclusions, but...

19:50.023 --> 19:52.400
I would not put something
like this past him.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.569
- Neither would I.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.529
J.D.'s company invested
in Fairfield,

19:56.571 --> 19:58.823
and now, they want all
their money back.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.742
- What? Are you kidding?

20:00.784 --> 20:03.536
- Well, my accountant found
a way to pay them out,

20:03.578 --> 20:05.497
and nobody is happier
to be out of business

20:05.538 --> 20:07.499
with that man than me,

20:07.540 --> 20:09.626
but if my financial situation
has been slightly different,

20:09.668 --> 20:11.961
then it could've been
very bad timing.

20:12.003 --> 20:15.173
- That's probably exactly
what he was hoping for.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.716
- I'm starting to see why
everyone

20:16.758 --> 20:19.260
who was running against J.D.
dropped out.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.599
(Birds chirp)

20:28.561 --> 20:30.271
- So I hear you're leaving us.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.528
I bet you're gonna miss Boots,
huh?

20:40.573 --> 20:43.410
Well, not to worry.
You can come by, visit anytime.

20:43.451 --> 20:45.245
Boots will be right here
waiting for you.

20:47.122 --> 20:49.541
- But it'll be different.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.168
I'll always have to say goodbye.

20:52.210 --> 20:55.130
Not just to boots,
but to everyone.

20:55.171 --> 20:58.758
- Well, it's not really saying
goodbye, is it?

20:58.800 --> 21:00.552
It's more like...

21:00.593 --> 21:01.803
see ya later.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.266
- It won't be the same.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.310
- No... no, it won't.

21:11.521 --> 21:14.983
But that's not necessarily
a bad thing.

21:15.025 --> 21:16.901
No matter what, Heartland will
always be here.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.737
It's been here six generations,

21:18.778 --> 21:20.947
so, trust me,
it's not going anywhere.

21:24.159 --> 21:26.828
- Hey, Jack, do you think
you might have some time

21:26.870 --> 21:28.913
to help me with something?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.957
- Well, depends on what that
something is, I guess.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.839
(Paper rustles)

21:39.341 --> 21:41.676
- I wanna make that for Amy
and Ty,

21:41.718 --> 21:45.096
but I don't really know
where to start.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.639
- Well, I think it's pretty
doable

21:46.681 --> 21:49.059
for guys like you and me.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.727
First thing we have to do

21:50.769 --> 21:52.312
is find the right material
though.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.482
Help me look, come on.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.444
(Chuckles)

21:59.486 --> 22:01.071
(Spartan huffs)

22:01.112 --> 22:02.364
- You're a good boy, Spartan.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.242
You wanna go for a ride?

22:06.284 --> 22:08.370
We'll take it nice and slow.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.873
I'm not gonna let you get hurt,
I promise.

22:14.793 --> 22:21.758
**

22:21.800 --> 22:27.180
**

22:27.222 --> 22:33.687
**

22:33.728 --> 22:35.105
(Spartan grunts softly)

22:35.146 --> 22:43.196
**

22:43.238 --> 22:44.447
(Spartan nickers)

22:44.489 --> 22:52.539
**

22:52.580 --> 22:53.748
- (Sighs)

22:58.086 --> 23:00.714
<i>(Approaching footsteps,</i>
<i>loud knock)</i>

23:00.755 --> 23:02.048
- Hey, Georgie,
do you have a second?

23:02.090 --> 23:03.967
- Yeah.

23:04.009 --> 23:06.469
I heard that Luke is moving
back in with his mom.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.054
- Yeah...

23:08.096 --> 23:10.640
- It's gonna be weird
not having him around.

23:10.682 --> 23:13.435
- Yeah, it will.
(Chuckles)

23:13.476 --> 23:16.146
You know, we were just getting
into a good routine

23:16.187 --> 23:18.231
and now everything's changing
again.

23:18.273 --> 23:20.900
I know how much his mom loves
him, and I...

23:20.942 --> 23:23.820
I trust that this is
the right thing for Luke.

23:23.862 --> 23:26.614
But that's not what I came up
here to talk to you about.

23:26.656 --> 23:29.325
I wanted to discuss Atlas.

23:29.367 --> 23:31.244
- I know what you're gonna say.

23:31.286 --> 23:33.913
I'm sorry for being
so insensitive.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.206
I didn't mean to push you
like that--

23:35.248 --> 23:37.542
- Actually, I was going to say
that I'm glad you pushed me

23:37.584 --> 23:39.753
the way you did.

23:39.794 --> 23:41.755
- Really?
- (Sighs)

23:41.796 --> 23:44.674
Yeah, 'cause you were right.

23:44.716 --> 23:46.634
Having another horse would take
the pressure off Spartan.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.889
I... I just don't know
if I'm ready for that yet.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.726
So I... I guess
what I'm saying is,

23:56.102 --> 23:59.022
I'm okay for you
to keep pushing me,

23:59.064 --> 24:00.774
but you're gonna have to be
patient too.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.069
- I totally get that.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.946
- Okay. What're you doing
right now?

24:06.988 --> 24:09.866
- Besides cyberstalking Quinn?
Nothing.

24:09.908 --> 24:11.868
- (Chuckles) You wanna go
for a ride?

24:11.910 --> 24:13.828
- Yeah, sure.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.796
<i>(Door bangs shut)</i>
- Lou!

24:22.837 --> 24:24.798
I hear you had a visit from the
health inspector this morning,

24:24.839 --> 24:26.841
but I have no complaints
about this pie!

24:26.883 --> 24:29.469
- Really? And you wouldn't
happen to know

24:29.511 --> 24:31.805
anything about this, would you?
- No, of course not.

24:31.846 --> 24:33.473
But if I were you, I wouldn't
go around showing people

24:33.515 --> 24:35.392
your family's indifference
to the law.

24:35.433 --> 24:37.894
- Do you really think you can
intimidate me with your lies?

24:37.936 --> 24:39.771
- I resent that, Lou.

24:39.813 --> 24:41.189
I've always been up front
and honest

24:41.231 --> 24:42.732
and I expect others to be
as well,

24:42.774 --> 24:44.192
and if they're not,
I cut ties with them.

24:44.234 --> 24:46.403
For example, I recently had
to pull an investment

24:46.444 --> 24:48.863
out of a local stable that
was being run into the ground.

24:48.905 --> 24:50.740
I'm sure you've heard of them.
Fairfield?

24:50.782 --> 24:52.325
- I'm not gonna let you
get away with this.

24:52.367 --> 24:54.119
I'm gonna make sure everyone
in this town

24:54.160 --> 24:56.287
knows exactly the kind of
person you really are.

24:56.329 --> 24:59.040
- Oh, I wouldn't do that
if I were you, Lou.

24:59.082 --> 25:02.961
You see, I play golf
with Fred Garland's dad, Dave.

25:03.003 --> 25:05.839
It's Dave's vision that guides
the Garland food empire.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.507
I've been talking
a lot to him lately

25:07.549 --> 25:09.843
about, um, alternative beef
products.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.428
Have you ever tasted them?

25:11.469 --> 25:13.388
They're made with pea proteins

25:13.430 --> 25:15.098
and they are absolutely
delicious.

25:15.140 --> 25:16.891
I think they're the future.

25:16.933 --> 25:19.060
In fact, I've invested
pretty heavily in them.

25:19.102 --> 25:21.479
Heartland beef could soon be
a relic of the past,

25:21.521 --> 25:24.315
or, for that matter,
Aspen Grove beef.

25:24.357 --> 25:27.068
At least that's what I'm gonna
tell him at our next golf game.

25:27.110 --> 25:29.863
Now, if uh... you'd excuse me.

25:34.159 --> 25:36.411
- 'Kay, fold 'em in half,
leave them at the door.

25:36.453 --> 25:37.996
- Thanks.
- You got it.

25:38.038 --> 25:39.539
(People chatter)

25:40.999 --> 25:43.543
- Hi, guys. Uh, Dad?
What's-what's happening?

25:43.585 --> 25:45.879
- Oh, these people showed up
to help with the campaign.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.547
- Great.
- They're gonna put in signs,

25:47.589 --> 25:49.299
they're gonna knock on doors.
- I need to talk to you.

25:49.341 --> 25:50.842
- Hey, you should give 'em
a little speech.

25:50.884 --> 25:52.802
- Dad!
- Yeah, no,

25:52.844 --> 25:54.471
to inspire the troops.
Hey, everybody, listen up.

25:54.512 --> 25:56.306
Lou would like to say
something.

25:56.348 --> 25:58.099
They're all yours.
- (Sighs) Okay, um...

25:58.141 --> 26:00.060
hey, everybody, thank you
so much for being here,

26:00.101 --> 26:03.063
it truly,
truly means a lot to me,

26:03.104 --> 26:04.522
but um...

26:04.564 --> 26:06.149
I'm sorry to have wasted
your time

26:06.191 --> 26:08.109
because I'm gonna be dropping
out of the race.

26:08.151 --> 26:11.112
I'm... I'm not gonna be running
for mayor, so...

26:11.154 --> 26:12.697
so sorry.

26:18.453 --> 26:20.497
- Lou, wait a minute!
- Dad!

26:20.538 --> 26:23.041
- Wait. You mind telling me
what just happened in there?

26:23.083 --> 26:24.501
- Werth is gonna win this
election

26:24.542 --> 26:27.128
one way or the other, okay?

26:27.170 --> 26:29.255
- I can't believe that you
would let him intimidate you

26:29.297 --> 26:31.800
with a couple of calls
to bylaw enforcement.

26:31.841 --> 26:33.885
- He knows Fred Garland's dad.
- Well so what?

26:33.927 --> 26:35.387
- So, he threatened
to sour the deal

26:35.428 --> 26:37.055
with Heartland and Aspen Grove.

26:37.097 --> 26:38.473
- Don't believe him.
He's full of it.

26:38.515 --> 26:40.600
- Considering what he's already
done to Lisa,

26:40.642 --> 26:42.352
you really think J.D.'s not
the kind of guy

26:42.394 --> 26:45.438
who's gonna follow through
on his threats?

26:45.480 --> 26:47.607
And anyway, I made the decision
to run for mayor

26:47.649 --> 26:49.442
in the heat of the moment.
I didn't even...

26:49.484 --> 26:52.445
talk to Mitch about it,
and that was unfair.

26:52.487 --> 26:53.905
And I really hurt him, so...

26:55.281 --> 26:57.367
- You're worried about Mitch,

26:57.409 --> 26:59.244
the guy who betrayed
our family business?

26:59.285 --> 27:02.497
- I care about him, Dad.
A lot, okay?

27:02.539 --> 27:04.916
And I'm not going to lose him
over this election,

27:04.958 --> 27:06.960
and I'm definitely not gonna
put our family

27:07.002 --> 27:08.545
in J.D.'s line of fire.

27:08.586 --> 27:11.297
So, dropping out
is the right decision.

27:12.465 --> 27:14.175
I'm sorry.

27:20.348 --> 27:22.100
(Truck rumbles to a halt)

27:25.145 --> 27:27.063
- You!

27:27.105 --> 27:28.523
- Listen, I'm just here
to see Lou, okay?

27:28.565 --> 27:30.316
I don't have time to have
another fight

27:30.358 --> 27:32.193
about the cattle business.
- You might not know this,

27:32.235 --> 27:35.030
but if it wasn't for me, Lou may
never have gone after you

27:35.071 --> 27:37.157
the day of your wedding.

27:37.198 --> 27:38.867
But I told her not to have
any regrets.

27:38.908 --> 27:41.453
Which is kind of ironic
considering...

27:41.494 --> 27:43.913
how much I regret
telling her that now.

27:43.955 --> 27:45.206
You know why?
- Why?

27:45.248 --> 27:47.375
- Because of the way you're
acting over this election.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.294
I mean, who cares if she didn't
tell you first.

27:49.336 --> 27:51.087
- I was the last person
she talked to.

27:51.129 --> 27:52.172
I didn't even know
she was running.

27:52.213 --> 27:54.382
- Oh... Well, guess what?

27:54.424 --> 27:57.093
She's not running anymore.

27:57.135 --> 27:59.721
Which is a shame because she
would've made a great mayor.

28:01.639 --> 28:04.142
But what do you care, right?

28:04.184 --> 28:06.478
You got what you wanted.

28:06.519 --> 28:08.229
- I... that's not what I wanted.

28:10.315 --> 28:12.359
- Well, maybe it's not too late

28:12.400 --> 28:14.527
for you to try to change
her mind.

28:14.569 --> 28:17.197
That is, if you can get over
yourself first.

28:26.331 --> 28:28.833
- You know, I've galloped
Spartan across these fields

28:28.875 --> 28:31.294
so many times I've lost count.

28:31.336 --> 28:33.171
He's just always been
so strong.

28:33.213 --> 28:35.006
It was easy to take for granted
he'd be like that forever.

28:36.675 --> 28:39.052
- You can treat his arthritis.

28:39.094 --> 28:41.596
- I know, and Ty and I have
talked about that, but...

28:41.638 --> 28:44.349
he's never gonna be like
he was.

28:44.391 --> 28:46.685
I think I've known that
for a while. It...

28:46.726 --> 28:49.187
I just didn't wanna believe it.

28:49.229 --> 28:52.190
- I'm sorry I tried
to make you buy Atlas.

28:52.232 --> 28:55.110
I'm such an idiot.
- No, Georgie, it's fine,

28:55.151 --> 28:57.320
and we're good.
I told you that.

28:57.362 --> 28:59.406
- Yeah, I know, it's just...

28:59.447 --> 29:02.492
I haven't been 100 % honest
with you.

29:02.534 --> 29:04.244
Half the reason I wanted
to help you

29:04.285 --> 29:06.121
with Spartan so bad was...

29:06.162 --> 29:07.997
'cause I needed a distraction.

29:08.039 --> 29:09.499
- From what?

29:09.541 --> 29:11.084
- Quinn.
- (Chuckles)

29:12.585 --> 29:15.088
Well, cyberstalking him
probably doesn't help.

29:15.130 --> 29:16.923
- I know.

29:16.965 --> 29:18.591
I hate social media.

29:18.633 --> 29:20.677
Now I know that he's in Kelowna
at a horse show.

29:20.719 --> 29:22.303
He's one province over.

29:24.305 --> 29:27.017
When he's far away, telling him
to leave made sense, but...

29:27.058 --> 29:28.685
the closer he is...

29:28.727 --> 29:31.396
the more nothing makes sense.

29:31.438 --> 29:33.732
- Well, maybe you shouldn't
worry about what makes sense.

29:33.773 --> 29:36.484
You're young enough to make
a few mistakes

29:36.526 --> 29:38.820
and take some risks.
I know I sure did.

29:41.448 --> 29:44.159
- Hmm. Is that one
of the wild colts?

29:44.200 --> 29:46.119
- Hey, yeah, I know this guy.

29:46.161 --> 29:48.288
That's the one that I was gonna
gentle for Sam.

29:48.329 --> 29:49.956
(Hooves thud softly)

29:49.998 --> 29:53.501
**

29:57.005 --> 29:58.173
(Amused exhale)

29:58.214 --> 30:00.300
(Colt grunts softly)

30:00.342 --> 30:01.968
- Look at that.

30:03.678 --> 30:05.638
(Chuckles softly)

30:05.680 --> 30:07.974
<i>I've never seen anything</i>
<i>like it.</i>

30:11.978 --> 30:13.480
(Birds chirp)

30:13.521 --> 30:14.647
<i>(Approaching footsteps)</i>

30:14.689 --> 30:16.024
- (Sighs)

30:19.486 --> 30:23.365
- So, I had a very interesting
conversation with your father.

30:23.406 --> 30:25.325
He said that he was the one
that convinced you

30:25.367 --> 30:28.536
to come talk to me
on my wedding day.

30:28.578 --> 30:32.582
He said something about...
you not having any regrets.

30:32.624 --> 30:34.584
- (Sighs)

30:34.626 --> 30:36.586
- Lou, I gotta tell you
the same thing.

30:36.628 --> 30:39.381
You can't drop out of
this election.

30:39.422 --> 30:40.965
- Mitch--
- If you let...

30:41.007 --> 30:42.717
J.D. Werth win by acclimation

30:42.759 --> 30:45.470
it's gonna haunt you
for the rest of your life.

30:45.512 --> 30:47.806
- I figured you'd be relieved.

30:47.847 --> 30:50.225
- (Sighs) Sweetie, come here.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.480
Listen, I didn't fall in love
with you

30:57.315 --> 30:59.317
because you're somebody
who sits on the sidelines

30:59.359 --> 31:03.363
and waits for somebody else
to speaks up.

31:03.405 --> 31:06.700
I fell in love with you because
you're the one that speaks up.

31:06.741 --> 31:10.078
Because you jump in
with both feet.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.789
- Well, you didn't seem
to appreciate

31:12.831 --> 31:14.916
my two-footed jump
into politics yesterday.

31:16.626 --> 31:18.670
- That is true, that's true,

31:18.712 --> 31:21.214
but that's only because
I was hurt

31:21.256 --> 31:22.924
because I wasn't part of
your decision.

31:24.718 --> 31:28.138
But now I'm very excited
to celebrate

31:28.179 --> 31:29.514
when you win that election.

31:29.556 --> 31:31.349
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

31:31.391 --> 31:32.767
In fact, I think that
we should go out

31:32.809 --> 31:34.394
and I'm gonna buy a bottle
of champagne

31:34.436 --> 31:35.937
that we can drink
on the election night.

31:37.272 --> 31:38.857
- That's sweet,

31:38.898 --> 31:42.777
but you might just wanna save
your money.

31:42.819 --> 31:45.363
Because even if I did jump back
into the race,

31:45.405 --> 31:47.365
J.D. is still ahead
in the polls.

31:47.407 --> 31:50.035
But if I'm being truthful,
I really wanna win.

31:51.453 --> 31:54.372
I would be a great mayor.

31:54.414 --> 31:57.208
- I know. I know you'd be
a great mayor.

31:57.250 --> 31:59.127
- Hey, Lou?
- Hey.

31:59.169 --> 32:01.087
- Uh, sorry to interrupt.
- No, no, no.

32:01.129 --> 32:03.673
- Uh, listen, I was just
talking to Bob

32:03.715 --> 32:06.301
from the Wildlife Reserve,
and he was telling me

32:06.343 --> 32:07.719
his theory of why there's been
so many reports

32:07.761 --> 32:09.262
of increased wildlife
in the area.

32:09.304 --> 32:11.348
- Okay.

32:11.389 --> 32:12.599
- So you know that huge
housing development being built

32:12.640 --> 32:14.392
on the west side
of Gibson Creek.

32:14.434 --> 32:15.810
- Yeah, I've seen ads
in the paper.

32:15.852 --> 32:18.271
Huge mountain view lots,
too much money.

32:18.313 --> 32:20.231
- Right. But what they're not
saying in the ads

32:20.273 --> 32:22.400
is it's being built along
a major wildlife corridor.

32:22.442 --> 32:23.818
So when they started
construction,

32:23.860 --> 32:25.653
all the prey animals fled;

32:25.695 --> 32:27.572
<i>that's why we're seeing</i>
<i>wolves and cougars</i>

32:27.614 --> 32:29.616
wandering into people's
backyards.

32:29.657 --> 32:32.577
Guess who's behind the building
of this housing development?

32:32.619 --> 32:34.579
- J.D. Werth.
- (Chuckles)

32:34.621 --> 32:37.248
- Exactly.

32:37.290 --> 32:39.501
- Hey, do you think that um...

32:39.542 --> 32:42.337
Bob would be willing to talk
to the press about this?

32:42.379 --> 32:43.630
- I'm sure he'd be more
than happy to.

32:43.672 --> 32:46.383
- Okay. I'm gonna pass
onto you, um,

32:46.424 --> 32:48.343
a contact at the Hudson Times.
Can you share it with him?

32:48.385 --> 32:50.261
- No problem.
- Okay, thanks.

32:52.222 --> 32:54.432
- You know what?
On second thought,

32:54.474 --> 32:56.267
maybe you should buy that
bottle of champagne after all.

33:01.815 --> 33:04.734
- Hello, J.D.
- Lou. I heard a rumour

33:04.776 --> 33:06.528
you're dropping out
of the race.

33:06.569 --> 33:08.780
- Well, you should know better
than to believe rumors.

33:08.822 --> 33:11.282
I prefer to stick to facts,
like uh...

33:11.324 --> 33:13.451
the ones in this article

33:13.493 --> 33:15.787
about your housing development.

33:15.829 --> 33:18.456
- Well, I already read
the article

33:18.498 --> 33:20.375
and frankly, there's not
a word of truth in it.

33:20.417 --> 33:22.419
The only thing more fictitious
than that article

33:22.460 --> 33:24.796
is your chances
of becoming mayor.

33:24.838 --> 33:26.840
- How many bribes does it take

33:26.881 --> 33:29.300
to get houses built
on a wildlife corridor?

33:31.636 --> 33:33.430
- You say that one more time

33:33.471 --> 33:35.181
I'll sue you so fast
you won't know what hit you.

33:35.223 --> 33:37.183
- I don't have to say it.

33:37.225 --> 33:39.352
Everyone's already thinking it.

33:39.394 --> 33:42.230
So, you can try to intimidate
me and my family all you want,

33:42.272 --> 33:44.649
but I'm not scared of you
anymore.

33:44.691 --> 33:46.276
So, come election day,

33:46.317 --> 33:48.194
my name will be on
that ballot -

33:48.236 --> 33:50.071
count on it.

33:53.742 --> 33:57.996
**

33:58.038 --> 34:00.248
(Colt grunts,
Amy clucks her tongue)

34:02.876 --> 34:04.753
- Thanks for your help, Georgie.

34:04.794 --> 34:05.920
<i>- Yeah, no problem.</i>

34:05.962 --> 34:07.881
That was easy.

34:07.922 --> 34:09.424
The hard part will be
gentling him.

34:09.466 --> 34:11.551
- (Sighs) Yeah, that's true.

34:11.592 --> 34:14.929
But the way he connected
with Spartan yesterday...

34:14.971 --> 34:17.349
I know this sounds crazy, but...

34:17.389 --> 34:19.309
it's almost like Spartan
was giving me his approval.

34:19.351 --> 34:20.810
- What makes you so sure
this horse

34:20.851 --> 34:23.228
will be a better fit
than Atlas?

34:23.271 --> 34:25.732
- I don't know.

34:25.774 --> 34:28.902
Atlas is a pretty perfect
horse, but...

34:28.943 --> 34:31.612
I don't think I'm looking
for the perfect horse.

34:31.654 --> 34:33.406
I think I'm looking for
the right horse.

34:35.283 --> 34:36.909
(Colt whickers)

34:36.951 --> 34:38.995
- How do you know
he's the right one?

34:39.036 --> 34:41.873
- (Sighs) Just a feeling.

34:41.915 --> 34:45.210
When something feels right,
you have to at least try.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.757
(Crickets chirp)

34:50.799 --> 34:53.385
Jack: Now that we're done,
how about a game of chess?

34:53.426 --> 34:54.552
- Definitely.

34:56.471 --> 34:58.515
- All right. Mhmm.

34:58.556 --> 35:01.017
- Wow, cool chess set.

35:01.059 --> 35:03.770
Is it new?
- It is,

35:03.812 --> 35:05.939
and it's yours.

35:05.980 --> 35:08.441
It's a gift from all of us.

35:08.483 --> 35:09.984
- Thank you so much.

35:10.026 --> 35:11.945
I love it!

35:11.986 --> 35:14.030
But half the pawns are missing.

35:14.072 --> 35:16.658
- Nah, they're not.
- Thank you.

35:16.700 --> 35:19.536
- I've got one right here.

35:19.577 --> 35:21.746
Luke,

35:21.788 --> 35:25.041
always take care
of the ones you love.

35:25.083 --> 35:26.918
- And wherever you go,

35:26.960 --> 35:28.837
you take a piece of this place
with you.

35:28.878 --> 35:30.171
Keep it close to your heart,
'kay?

35:31.965 --> 35:34.467
- Don't be afraid to take
a risk every now and then,

35:34.509 --> 35:36.136
even if it scares you
half to death.

35:39.472 --> 35:42.434
- I'm totally moving up
to the loft once you leave,

35:42.475 --> 35:44.144
but I'm really gonna miss you.

35:44.185 --> 35:46.730
- Luke, try to let Jack win
a couple games.

35:46.771 --> 35:47.814
It's good for his ego.
- (Chuckles)

35:47.856 --> 35:49.482
- Take that?
- Sure.

35:52.777 --> 35:55.363
Luke, your mom is your family,
and now so are we.

35:56.781 --> 35:58.658
And families always stick
together,

35:58.700 --> 36:00.368
no matter how far away
they are.

36:03.663 --> 36:06.124
- Your life may change a lot,

36:06.166 --> 36:08.084
but you're always welcome here.

36:08.126 --> 36:11.338
- It's true.
So you come visit us, okay?

36:14.090 --> 36:15.884
And remember to breathe.

36:20.096 --> 36:22.599
- Thank you so much.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.559
I love it.
It's perfect.

36:27.812 --> 36:30.440
- So, we gonna play or what?

36:30.482 --> 36:32.567
- Yeah, let's play.
- All right.

36:32.609 --> 36:34.819
And don't you dare
let me win.

36:34.861 --> 36:36.571
All: (Laughing)

36:41.576 --> 36:42.869
- Hey!
- Hey.

36:42.911 --> 36:44.454
- You're not gonna believe this.
- What?

36:44.496 --> 36:46.664
- Well, ever since that article
came out,

36:46.706 --> 36:48.500
there's been a serious uptick
in the number of volunteers.

36:48.541 --> 36:49.751
- Really?
- (Laughs)

36:51.169 --> 36:52.587
- All these people are here
for me?

36:52.629 --> 36:54.798
- You better believe it, honey.
You feel like saying something?

36:54.839 --> 36:55.924
- Yeah.

36:57.425 --> 36:58.802
Hey, everybody.

36:58.843 --> 37:00.804
Thank you so much
for being here.

37:00.845 --> 37:02.597
Wow. I just...

37:03.932 --> 37:06.559
I just wanted to say...

37:06.601 --> 37:08.978
that J.D. Werth and I have
very different visions

37:09.020 --> 37:11.064
for this town.

37:11.106 --> 37:14.025
<i>He wants to build big houses</i>
<i>and big box stores,</i>

37:14.067 --> 37:16.486
and I know for a fact
he wants to change the face

37:16.528 --> 37:17.946
of our beloved main street.

37:19.531 --> 37:21.533
He calls it progress,

37:21.574 --> 37:23.535
but progress for who?

37:23.576 --> 37:25.537
<i>For a handful of wealthy people</i>

37:25.578 --> 37:27.247
who wanna buy summer homes
with a view?

37:27.288 --> 37:29.874
A view that's already cost
countless wildlife

37:29.916 --> 37:31.543
their natural habitat.

37:31.584 --> 37:33.169
Is that, is that the town
we really wanna live in?

37:33.211 --> 37:34.879
Volunteers: No. Unh-unh.

37:34.921 --> 37:37.465
- For me, Hudson has always
been a hopeful place.

37:37.507 --> 37:40.010
It's a place that welcomes
everyone

37:40.051 --> 37:42.512
to the dinner table.

37:42.554 --> 37:45.515
So I say that we fight
to protect that!

37:45.557 --> 37:48.601
And we fight to keep it
that way.

37:48.643 --> 37:50.395
Because in Hudson...

37:50.437 --> 37:52.397
we're family!

37:52.439 --> 37:54.315
(Clapping)

37:58.570 --> 37:59.863
- Are you sure you have
everything, Luke?

37:59.904 --> 38:01.990
<i>- Yup.</i>

38:02.032 --> 38:04.534
- Well, you come visit us
anytime you want, okay?

38:04.576 --> 38:06.703
- I will. I promise.

38:06.745 --> 38:09.039
- If you need a ride
or anything,

38:09.080 --> 38:10.707
you let me know.

38:10.749 --> 38:12.500
- Okay. Bye.

38:18.089 --> 38:20.383
Bye, Lyndy.

38:20.425 --> 38:22.010
Oh! I almost forgot!

38:24.304 --> 38:26.014
Jack helped me make this
for you.

38:26.056 --> 38:27.640
But you can't open it here.

38:27.682 --> 38:29.601
You have to open it
at the new house, okay?

38:29.642 --> 38:32.520
- Okay. Thanks, Luke.

38:40.820 --> 38:42.572
(Sighs)

38:42.614 --> 38:51.581
**

38:51.623 --> 38:59.964
**

39:00.006 --> 39:01.049
- Goodbye, Luke.

39:02.509 --> 39:03.802
(Door slams shut)

39:06.888 --> 39:08.765
(Engine starts)

39:08.807 --> 39:10.392
Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

39:11.976 --> 39:19.901
**

39:23.655 --> 39:25.740
(Car rumbles)

39:31.996 --> 39:33.415
(Door bangs shut)

39:35.834 --> 39:37.585
- I need this done quickly.

39:37.627 --> 39:38.837
- It should only take
a few days.

39:38.878 --> 39:41.423
Snares'll take care of most.
Anything left...

39:41.464 --> 39:43.091
I'll deal with personally.
- I don't need the details.

39:43.133 --> 39:44.801
I just need this wildlife
problem to disappear.

39:44.843 --> 39:46.428
- Consider it done.

39:48.179 --> 39:50.765
Hey!

39:50.807 --> 39:52.267
This isn't the amount
we agreed on. Where's the rest?

39:52.308 --> 39:53.768
- You'll get it
when you finish the job.

39:58.023 --> 40:01.109
(Engine starts,
car rumbles away)

40:06.948 --> 40:08.742
- Now here is a list
of all the people

40:08.783 --> 40:10.910
who requested lawn signs.

40:10.952 --> 40:13.455
You don't mind dropping
those off today, do you?

40:13.496 --> 40:15.999
- That's gonna take all day!
- What he means is,

40:16.041 --> 40:18.585
no, we don't mind.
Let's go.

40:18.626 --> 40:19.753
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

40:19.794 --> 40:20.962
- Hey.
- Hello, Georgie.

40:21.004 --> 40:23.048
- Hi.
- Hey, Rem!

40:24.799 --> 40:26.801
(Lou sighs, texting taps)

40:28.136 --> 40:29.679
Mom?

40:29.721 --> 40:31.765
- Yeah, honey?

40:31.806 --> 40:34.351
- Can I borrow the car?

40:34.392 --> 40:35.810
- Yeah. Yeah, the keys
are right there.

40:37.312 --> 40:39.647
Where you headed?

40:39.689 --> 40:41.900
- Just to Kelowna.

40:41.941 --> 40:43.318
- Uh...

40:43.360 --> 40:45.278
I'm sorry,
did you say Kelowna?

40:45.320 --> 40:47.280
Why would you need to go there?

40:47.322 --> 40:49.699
- 'Cause that's where Quinn is.

40:49.741 --> 40:50.992
He's at a horse show there.

40:54.162 --> 40:56.206
I know how it sounds,
but my friend Rachel,

40:56.247 --> 40:58.875
from camp, lives there,
so I can stay with her.

40:58.917 --> 41:00.168
You can call her mom
if you want.

41:00.210 --> 41:03.755
- Yeah, I will.
But Georgie, I mean...

41:03.797 --> 41:06.049
that's long way to go.

41:06.091 --> 41:08.343
- I've been trying
to ignore my feelings

41:08.385 --> 41:10.887
because I thought it was
the sensible thing to do.

41:10.929 --> 41:12.722
And it turns out
it's not sensible,

41:12.764 --> 41:15.308
it was just safe.

41:15.350 --> 41:17.352
Maybe this thing with Quinn
won't work out,

41:17.394 --> 41:19.270
maybe it's a big mistake,
but I think...

41:19.312 --> 41:21.690
if something feels right,
then I should try.

41:24.859 --> 41:27.112
- (Sighs)

41:27.153 --> 41:30.156
You better call me
every hour to check in.

41:30.198 --> 41:31.700
Every hour.
- I will.

41:33.076 --> 41:34.494
Thank you!

41:36.746 --> 41:38.039
(Both sigh)

41:38.081 --> 41:39.708
(Wild horse whinnies)

41:39.749 --> 41:41.042
Amy: (Sighs)

41:44.045 --> 41:45.922
(Chuckles softly)
Do you wanna open it, Lyndy?

41:45.964 --> 41:47.340
- Yeah.

41:47.382 --> 41:48.800
Ty: Yeah?
- Come here.

41:48.842 --> 41:51.344
<i>Ty: Okay! (Chuckles)</i>

41:51.386 --> 41:52.929
All right.

41:52.971 --> 41:55.098
- This part right here?
Both: Yeah.

41:55.140 --> 41:57.559
* I hear what isn't said *

42:01.896 --> 42:04.441
- That's me!
- Yeah.

42:04.482 --> 42:06.359
- That's Lyndy,
and daddy and mommy.

42:06.401 --> 42:08.069
Who's that?
- Our Luke!

42:08.111 --> 42:10.739
- That is Luke.
What a beautiful gift.

42:12.240 --> 42:15.910
* There's a garden
left untended *

42:15.952 --> 42:17.996
- (Reads) "For the new house,
when it has walls.

42:18.038 --> 42:20.790
Like Jack said,
it's not good-bye.

42:20.832 --> 42:22.500
Just see ya later."

42:22.542 --> 42:25.295
* There are wounds too deep
for mending *

42:25.337 --> 42:28.923
**

42:28.965 --> 42:32.093
* Ooh... *

42:32.135 --> 42:34.763
* You're the one I need *

42:38.058 --> 42:41.019
* And I... *
- (Nervous Sigh)

42:41.061 --> 42:44.147
* Fall beneath your wings *

42:44.189 --> 42:48.151
**

42:48.193 --> 42:50.362
* Can't fight the current *

42:50.403 --> 42:52.989
* It takes us to sea *

42:53.031 --> 42:57.285
**

42:57.327 --> 42:59.329
* But you'll still be *

42:59.371 --> 43:02.290
* The one I need *

43:04.959 --> 43:06.586
- I didn't think
it would be this hard.

43:09.089 --> 43:10.298
- Me neither.

43:12.842 --> 43:15.553
If you could go back though,

43:15.595 --> 43:17.138
would you agree
to foster Luke again?

43:18.431 --> 43:19.808
- In a heartbeat.

43:23.728 --> 43:24.938
- Me too.

43:24.979 --> 43:26.981
* But you'll still be *

43:27.023 --> 43:29.317
* The one I need *

43:31.236 --> 43:32.987
(Suspenseful music)
