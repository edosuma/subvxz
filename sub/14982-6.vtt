WEBVTT

00:01.851 --> 00:04.771
Oh, my God,
I can't believe this!

00:06.602 --> 00:07.786
This is incredible.

00:10.252 --> 00:12.720
Who we are, what we've done.

00:12.771 --> 00:16.641
We are Scientific
Re-Patterning.

00:20.331 --> 00:23.917
Ha ha ha. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:24.001 --> 00:26.252
You know,
before I came out here today

00:26.337 --> 00:28.621
I was backstage, I was
working on my speech

00:28.706 --> 00:35.044
and I noticed that there
were no collisions.

00:35.095 --> 00:38.381
Nobody was getting
in anyone else's way.

00:38.432 --> 00:42.185
Everybody had
a sense of purpose...

00:43.020 --> 00:45.989
Of direction.

00:46.056 --> 00:48.942
They belonged.

00:49.026 --> 00:55.114
And I realized that I was
watching this pattern

00:55.199 --> 00:58.952
where everyone knew exactly
what to do and where to be

00:59.036 --> 01:02.288
but without disrupting
anyone else's flow.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.882 --> 01:17.220
They were embraced
by the same energy.

01:19.807 --> 01:22.008
They were connected.

01:22.092 --> 01:26.145
Connected by the path that
the work needs in order

01:26.230 --> 01:30.316
for it to get done
efficiently and comfortably.

01:33.287 --> 01:36.305
Hey, Danny, it's mom.

01:36.357 --> 01:40.410
Listen, honey...
All that stuff,

01:40.477 --> 01:42.245
you know, that happened.

01:42.313 --> 01:45.331
I never meant
to hurt you.

01:46.750 --> 01:49.586
Everything's going
to be all right.

01:49.653 --> 01:52.338
Good-bye, Danielle.

01:53.340 --> 01:55.992
I love you...

01:56.060 --> 01:58.795
No matter what happens.

01:58.846 --> 02:01.381
We re-pattern...

02:01.465 --> 02:05.134
Through the transitions
and the precepts.

02:05.185 --> 02:08.020
We learn to live.

02:08.104 --> 02:11.507
We crave life.

02:11.559 --> 02:14.010
Would you guys stand up?

02:17.231 --> 02:19.282
These guys
have re-patterned.

02:27.291 --> 02:29.492
They've transitioned.

02:30.978 --> 02:32.962
Thank you, guys, and welcome.

02:39.053 --> 02:41.804
And now the precepts--

02:41.872 --> 02:46.776
singularity, courage,

02:46.844 --> 02:52.682
resolution, integrity,

02:52.733 --> 02:59.255
pride, and, finally...
Transcendence.

02:59.323 --> 03:04.226
The goal is transcendence.

03:04.278 --> 03:09.532
Believe and be free.

03:21.629 --> 03:24.163
I didn't mean to hurt you.

03:24.231 --> 03:27.266
Everything's going
to be all right.

03:27.351 --> 03:28.768
Good-bye, Danielle.

03:28.852 --> 03:31.254
I love you...
No matter what happens.

03:35.092 --> 03:40.313
John Stafford is responsible for
your mum's suicide attempt.

03:40.397 --> 03:42.115
Are you asking or saying?

03:42.182 --> 03:44.600
I'm just telling you what
you want to hear, love.

03:44.668 --> 03:49.155
My mother placed this call from
John Stafford's office phone.

03:49.223 --> 03:51.474
I came here prepared to pay
you whatever it takes

03:51.542 --> 03:54.961
for you to take her away
from that man and S.R.P.

03:55.045 --> 03:57.880
Why not start at
the hospital, Danielle?

03:57.948 --> 03:59.782
I did go to
the hospital first.

03:59.850 --> 04:00.917
She's not there.

04:00.984 --> 04:01.834
Where is she?

04:01.919 --> 04:03.720
Back at the
mother ship.

04:03.787 --> 04:06.172
She won't speak to me.

04:06.256 --> 04:08.141
Stafford won't let her.

04:08.225 --> 04:09.342
How do you know that?

04:09.426 --> 04:10.793
I know it.

04:12.963 --> 04:14.347
Trust me.

04:15.566 --> 04:18.233
I'm going to
expose John Stafford

04:18.301 --> 04:20.370
for the scam artist
that he is.

04:20.437 --> 04:22.839
All I care about
is my mother.

04:22.906 --> 04:24.640
She says smiling.

04:24.708 --> 04:25.942
I beg your pardon?

04:25.993 --> 04:29.311
What hospital did
they send your mum to?

04:29.363 --> 04:30.913
Stanton Park.

04:30.981 --> 04:32.248
All right.

04:32.315 --> 04:34.901
Loker, Torres, now.

04:34.968 --> 04:36.836
Is he taking the case?

04:36.920 --> 04:39.422
If he doesn't believe me,
why is he taking the case?

04:39.490 --> 04:42.291
You had him at suicide.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.512
Mr. Garret Sunderland?

04:46.597 --> 04:47.930
Dr. Sunderland.

04:47.998 --> 04:48.998
Can I help you?

04:49.049 --> 04:50.933
Like you helped
Carol Ashland?

04:51.001 --> 04:52.101
I'm sorry?

04:52.169 --> 04:54.687
Carol Ashland,
last night, overdose.

04:54.755 --> 04:55.772
Are you, uh...

04:55.839 --> 04:57.173
Police?

04:57.224 --> 04:58.741
Do we need to be?

04:58.809 --> 05:01.510
We're from
the Lightman Group.

05:01.562 --> 05:04.680
I'm Ria Torres,
this is Eli Loker.

05:04.732 --> 05:08.067
Maybe you've heard
of Dr. Lightman?

05:08.135 --> 05:10.186
Oh, you have? Good.

05:10.237 --> 05:12.004
So, enough about us.

05:12.072 --> 05:14.874
Carol Ashland or
do you need more time

05:14.958 --> 05:17.410
to think of an answer
that sounds like the truth?

05:17.494 --> 05:20.496
I'm not permitted
to discuss this.

05:20.547 --> 05:22.548
Doctor/patient
confidentiality.

05:22.633 --> 05:27.420
Gastric lavage would be
the standard treatment.

05:27.504 --> 05:29.288
It's stomach pumping.

05:29.356 --> 05:31.924
Batting a hundred so far, but
she's not at the hospital.

05:32.009 --> 05:35.678
Isn't attempted suicide an
automatic 3-day hold, doctor?

05:38.015 --> 05:39.548
You have a very
negative approach,

05:39.600 --> 05:41.234
if you don't
mind my saying so.

05:41.318 --> 05:43.903
It's a simple question.
Doesn't violate any laws.

05:45.155 --> 05:47.523
I evaluated Mrs. Ashland.

05:47.574 --> 05:49.859
She's not at risk
to herself or others.

05:49.910 --> 05:52.895
She's receiving
the appropriate care.

05:52.946 --> 05:53.913
Would that
appropriate care

05:53.997 --> 05:55.615
be Scientific
Re-Patterning?

05:59.569 --> 06:01.788
3 for 3, Loker, not bad.

06:03.340 --> 06:05.291
Fear dilates the pupils,

06:05.375 --> 06:08.077
limits visibility,
reaction times.

06:08.128 --> 06:10.746
You might want
to take the bus.

06:12.699 --> 06:15.301
It seems simple at first.

06:15.385 --> 06:19.722
Identify the negative patterns
that are holding us back.

06:19.773 --> 06:22.692
We have to break
down the problem.

06:22.759 --> 06:25.261
Tap the infinite
energy within.

06:25.312 --> 06:27.063
Can I get a little bit more
volume on my left monitor?

06:27.114 --> 06:28.064
I can hardly hear myself.

06:28.115 --> 06:31.851
What a load of old
bullocks, John!

06:34.121 --> 06:37.623
Your name is John, right?

07:09.690 --> 07:12.108
How you doing?
You all right?

07:12.159 --> 07:13.326
Doctors Lightman and Foster,

07:13.410 --> 07:15.328
from the Lightman
Group, good morning.

07:15.412 --> 07:16.645
Good morning.
Dr. Sunderland called.

07:16.697 --> 07:19.448
He's a friend of the Scientific
Re-Patterning community.

07:19.516 --> 07:20.649
Oh, yeah.
Welcome.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.785
We're actually in the same line
of work, doctor.

07:22.836 --> 07:23.819
Oh.

07:23.871 --> 07:25.254
We help people find
a positive truth.

07:25.322 --> 07:28.524
I'll bet you do
and then some, eh?

07:28.592 --> 07:31.510
Ha ha ha.
These are 2 of our initiates.

07:31.595 --> 07:33.662
Well, our initiates
are back at the office

07:33.714 --> 07:35.131
digging up crap
on you, mate.

07:35.182 --> 07:37.166
How's Carol
Ashland doing?

07:37.217 --> 07:41.170
She's doing very well.
Thanks for asking.

07:41.221 --> 07:43.773
No, um, she's very
well considering--

07:43.840 --> 07:44.941
that's what
you mean, right?

07:45.008 --> 07:46.692
She's in a re-integration
session.

07:46.777 --> 07:48.110
It's part of our program.

07:48.178 --> 07:49.228
Oh.

07:49.313 --> 07:51.513
Well, maybe we should
come back later.

07:51.565 --> 07:53.783
Yeah, with some of
our police initiates.

07:53.850 --> 07:55.534
We're here on behalf

07:55.619 --> 07:57.553
of the concern of Carol's
daughter, Danielle.

07:57.621 --> 08:00.323
Right, yes, Carol
mentioned her.

08:00.374 --> 08:01.690
She wanted her
to leave S.R.P.

08:01.742 --> 08:04.860
You really don't
like Danielle, do ya?

08:04.912 --> 08:06.629
Well, Carol's been with
us for a couple of years

08:06.697 --> 08:07.964
and she's come
a long way.

08:08.031 --> 08:09.415
I'm not sure why her daughter
would want her to leave.

08:09.499 --> 08:13.386
So, you have nothing
to hide at all?

08:14.554 --> 08:16.088
Well, suppose I interrupt
Carol's session,

08:16.173 --> 08:18.474
so you can see her and
decide for yourselves.

08:18.541 --> 08:22.762
Think positive.
That's what I always say.

08:25.599 --> 08:26.766
Carol?

08:26.850 --> 08:32.270
This is Dr. Lightman
and Dr. Foster.

08:33.273 --> 08:35.024
Hello.

08:36.226 --> 08:38.277
I'm sorry, were you
talking to me?

08:39.596 --> 08:41.614
Only you was looking
at God over there.

08:46.303 --> 08:50.906
Carol, we're here on behalf
of your daughter, Danielle.

08:50.958 --> 08:52.591
She's very worried
about you.

08:52.676 --> 08:55.594
Oh, please tell
my daughter not to worry.

08:55.679 --> 08:58.014
There's--
she's always worrying.

08:58.081 --> 09:02.551
She's as bad as my mother,
always getting into my business.

09:08.642 --> 09:10.092
You know...

09:11.261 --> 09:17.750
You can leave with us
right now if you like.

09:25.042 --> 09:29.278
I hear you, Carol.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.286
I really do.

09:39.421 --> 09:40.672
Are you sure you
didn't just hear

09:40.739 --> 09:41.923
what you wanted
to hear from Carol?

09:42.007 --> 09:43.258
Look, she's
trapped in there

09:43.342 --> 09:45.195
with those
S.R.P. robots.

09:45.480 --> 09:46.897
And you know this because
you read it on Stafford

09:46.965 --> 09:48.933
when you told Carol she was
free to leave with us?

09:48.984 --> 09:50.100
She's terrified of him.

09:50.151 --> 09:51.519
She doesn't know if
she's coming or going.

09:51.603 --> 09:53.521
No, I'm asking what you saw
in Stafford, not Carol.

09:53.605 --> 09:54.522
Man's a snake.

09:54.606 --> 09:55.906
You've got nothing on him.

09:55.974 --> 09:58.192
When I've got
nothing, all right,

09:58.276 --> 09:59.660
that is when I really
start to worry.

09:59.744 --> 10:01.745
No, that's prejudice
talking, not science.

10:01.813 --> 10:05.115
Hey, hey!

10:05.166 --> 10:06.250
Where are you going?

10:06.317 --> 10:07.868
We were just going to go out
and get some coffee.

10:07.953 --> 10:09.587
Well, what's wrong
with our coffee?

10:09.654 --> 10:12.489
I don't know, nothing.

10:12.557 --> 10:14.625
Keep digging on Stafford.

10:26.504 --> 10:29.390
You can go out
for coffee.

10:29.474 --> 10:31.842
You don't have to do
everything he says.

10:31.893 --> 10:33.277
He's right.

10:33.344 --> 10:35.579
This coffee is...good.

10:35.647 --> 10:37.898
Go get the coffee you like.

10:39.484 --> 10:41.535
Now.

10:50.295 --> 10:51.545
Hi, ya.

10:51.613 --> 10:55.749
Dad, uh, this is Liam.

10:57.035 --> 10:58.636
Liam.

11:00.839 --> 11:03.474
No, I got nothing.
What happened to Rick?

11:03.541 --> 11:04.808
Shut up, dad.

11:04.876 --> 11:07.227
I know, it's whatever
you want, you're right.

11:07.312 --> 11:09.647
You said you was
just leaving?

11:09.714 --> 11:11.632
Are you asking me to leave?

11:12.717 --> 11:13.684
Sorry.

11:13.735 --> 11:15.436
Can I just call
you later?

11:15.520 --> 11:16.904
Yeah.

11:16.988 --> 11:18.555
It was nice to meet you.

11:18.607 --> 11:20.658
I hear you're
writing another book.

11:20.725 --> 11:21.825
Can't wait to read it.

11:21.893 --> 11:23.360
Don't hold
your breath, son.

11:23.411 --> 11:25.228
Dad, come on, he was
just being polite.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.580
See you tomorrow.

11:26.665 --> 11:28.582
He seems
like a nice boy.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.567
Does everything have to be
a confrontation with you?

11:30.619 --> 11:31.702
What?

11:31.770 --> 11:33.954
I was being nice, you know,

11:34.039 --> 11:37.341
considering, you know,
I just come home from work,

11:37.408 --> 11:41.128
you know, hard day, nose to the
grindstone and that, you know.

11:41.212 --> 11:43.080
I just want a little bit
of piece and quiet,

11:43.131 --> 11:46.083
you know, maybe a touch of
the old telly, you know.

11:46.134 --> 11:49.803
Just like any normal dad, you
know, with their normal daughter.

11:49.888 --> 11:51.522
Well, you picked
the wrong house for that.

11:51.589 --> 11:53.023
I know what
your game is.

11:53.091 --> 11:54.108
What game?

11:54.192 --> 11:55.926
You feel that you can
mess with me by getting

11:55.977 --> 11:57.311
an 8-foot boyfriend, who's
built like a brick...

11:57.395 --> 11:59.279
Oh, come on, he's a good guy.

12:03.101 --> 12:04.267
Does he treat you well?

12:04.319 --> 12:06.737
I think you'd really
like him, dad.

12:08.957 --> 12:12.876
Liam, short for William?

12:14.295 --> 12:15.663
Willy.

12:15.747 --> 12:16.714
Is that
a work text, dad?

12:16.781 --> 12:18.615
I think you
better get going.

12:18.683 --> 12:21.819
Can I have my hug now?

12:21.886 --> 12:23.654
These people all
share the same

12:23.722 --> 12:27.290
essential characteristics--
a projection of certainty,

12:27.342 --> 12:28.892
a sense of their
own infallibility,

12:28.960 --> 12:32.396
a sense of being called to
a global mission and so on.

12:32.463 --> 12:33.397
We need to find
S.R.P. members

12:33.465 --> 12:34.698
to talk to
or ex-members.

12:34.766 --> 12:36.316
Find out what's
going on over there.

12:36.401 --> 12:38.686
Oh, yeah, I have been
looking and, uh...

12:38.770 --> 12:41.138
I found Jane Prescott,
ex-member,

12:41.189 --> 12:43.190
very prolific
on the blogosphere.

12:43.274 --> 12:46.527
Let's see if she wants
to come out and play.

12:54.119 --> 12:55.869
Carol?

12:59.207 --> 13:02.843
Oh, I want some of what
she's smoking, please.

13:02.927 --> 13:04.211
Ha ha.

13:04.295 --> 13:07.214
Thank you for coming back,
Dr. Lightman, Dr. Foster.

13:07.298 --> 13:11.518
I feel the last time we met I didn't
express myself clearly enough.

13:11.603 --> 13:12.502
We understand.

13:12.554 --> 13:14.171
You've been
through a lot

13:14.222 --> 13:16.640
in the last couple
of days, Carol.

13:18.526 --> 13:20.677
Oh, I get it.

13:20.729 --> 13:22.613
Carol, I do, I get it.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.282
It's shame, right?

13:26.918 --> 13:28.351
Only you don't want
to talk about it.

13:28.403 --> 13:31.071
I mean, not yet,
you know, obviously.

13:31.156 --> 13:33.490
I can take a hint.

13:34.976 --> 13:37.360
Right, I feel like going
for a nose about then.

13:37.412 --> 13:41.832
Don't run. It panics
the initiates.

13:47.872 --> 13:53.093
Whoa. I'm in
the wrong game, mate.

13:53.178 --> 13:56.013
Oh, we're not
so different.

13:56.064 --> 13:57.564
Well, paycheck for starters.

13:57.649 --> 14:01.101
How did you get started
in this racket, then, eh?

14:01.186 --> 14:04.772
It was a natural transition from
work I did earlier in my life.

14:04.856 --> 14:08.025
Part of my personal journey.

14:08.076 --> 14:10.944
What, a sort of fortune 500?

14:11.029 --> 14:13.914
It's not about
the money, Dr. Lightman.

14:13.998 --> 14:17.067
S.R.P. is a not-for-profit
organization.

14:17.118 --> 14:20.037
All revenue goes
toward helping people.

14:21.206 --> 14:24.007
If you hold down anger
like that, well,

14:24.075 --> 14:26.710
that's like holding
down a sneeze.

14:26.761 --> 14:30.430
Sooner or later you're going
to get hurt, mate.

14:33.351 --> 14:36.553
You know, your negative view
of the work isn't uncommon.

14:36.604 --> 14:39.589
One of your acolytes...

14:39.641 --> 14:42.860
Tried to kill herself
the night before last.

14:42.927 --> 14:44.444
Let's get one thing clear.

14:44.529 --> 14:48.932
S.R.P. is not
a religion or a cult.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.083
We don't have acolytes.

14:50.151 --> 14:52.252
What do you call
them then, eh?

14:52.320 --> 14:55.973
Do you ever wonder how people
see you, Dr. Lightman?

14:56.040 --> 14:57.841
You're going to tell me?

14:57.909 --> 15:00.644
You override people,
ignore them.

15:00.712 --> 15:05.132
And then when you feel
threatened, you get mean.

15:05.216 --> 15:08.051
You're a bully, Dr. Lightman.

15:08.119 --> 15:12.806
I'm a bully...
without acolytes.

15:12.891 --> 15:15.125
Ha ha ha.

15:22.633 --> 15:26.403
Um, do you mind?

15:26.470 --> 15:27.604
This is Joan.

15:27.655 --> 15:29.606
It's ok, I'd like her here.

15:29.657 --> 15:31.024
Thank you, Carol.

15:31.109 --> 15:33.694
I'm pleased to meet you.

15:36.247 --> 15:38.148
Why did you take
the pills, Carol?

15:38.199 --> 15:40.918
I can't dwell on that.

15:40.985 --> 15:44.571
It was a mistake and now I need
to re-direct my energies

15:44.639 --> 15:48.508
to purging the negative
and focusing on the positive.

15:48.593 --> 15:50.594
Are you happy here?

15:51.880 --> 15:54.181
Yes, I am.

15:54.265 --> 15:56.183
Can't you tell?

15:56.267 --> 15:58.135
Danielle misses you.

15:58.186 --> 16:00.854
She's very worried
about you.

16:00.939 --> 16:04.925
Misses is such a negative term,
but I hear you.

16:04.993 --> 16:08.028
My daughter loves me
and I love her.

16:08.112 --> 16:10.147
Carol, can you
say her name?

16:10.198 --> 16:11.815
Don't be so distant.

16:14.552 --> 16:16.036
Danielle.

16:17.989 --> 16:20.557
Thank you.

16:20.625 --> 16:25.646
See, we all have something
that we can offer each other.

16:38.593 --> 16:41.762
Hey, how are you getting along
with this lot then?

16:41.846 --> 16:44.564
I'm moving into
the fourth transition.

16:44.649 --> 16:47.217
Oh, the fourth transition.

16:47.268 --> 16:52.472
What's that then? Become
nothing, embrace the void.

16:52.540 --> 16:54.141
Well, that's better
than nothing, I suppose.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.627
It's a process. That's
why we're all here.

16:56.694 --> 16:58.912
Glad you could make it,
Dr. Lightman.

16:58.997 --> 17:03.350
I would not have missed
this for the world.

17:04.736 --> 17:06.118
Ready when you are.

17:06.186 --> 17:08.305
Carol, let's begin
with you, ok?

17:09.457 --> 17:12.792
Tell us about your
regression to transition 6.

17:12.877 --> 17:16.346
I need the group
to help me.

17:16.414 --> 17:19.299
You need help self-delivery.

17:19.384 --> 17:21.752
Carol, could you
explain what you mean?

17:21.819 --> 17:24.588
Self-delivering
is when we embrace

17:24.656 --> 17:25.638
the positive realities

17:25.707 --> 17:28.275
that we create
for ourselves.

17:28.358 --> 17:29.960
What's that mean, then?

17:30.028 --> 17:32.429
It means we
acknowledge our faults,

17:32.480 --> 17:35.532
things holding us back,
and we re-pattern.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.534
We self-deliver.

17:37.602 --> 17:39.653
Re-Patterning is possible
for everyone.

17:39.737 --> 17:41.972
Hey, Carol, wake up.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.241
This is a nightmare.

17:46.294 --> 17:49.162
Dr. Lightman, I invited
you here to see our work,

17:49.247 --> 17:51.365
not be a negative
disruption.

17:52.700 --> 17:58.171
Right then, well, I think I'll
self-deliver back to work.

17:58.256 --> 18:03.060
There's room in the van, all,
if anyone needs a lift.

18:03.127 --> 18:04.644
Will you send
my love to Danielle?

18:04.729 --> 18:07.014
Tell her that I'm
where I want to be

18:07.081 --> 18:10.100
and there's no need
to come back.

18:10.151 --> 18:12.269
I'm happy.

18:13.821 --> 18:18.375
If you stick around,
he's going to hurt you.

18:41.466 --> 18:43.133
Emily?

18:47.889 --> 18:50.640
Hey, what's
going on now?

18:53.677 --> 18:56.012
How did this get here?

18:56.064 --> 18:57.247
I don't know.

18:57.315 --> 18:58.782
I've never
seen it before.

18:58.850 --> 19:00.484
How long have you been up?

19:00.535 --> 19:03.686
Since I last
saw you, why?

19:03.738 --> 19:07.691
And you got absolutely
no idea how this got here?

19:07.759 --> 19:09.876
None. What is it?

19:09.961 --> 19:15.048
You do lock the doors and that
while I'm out, don't you?

19:15.133 --> 19:17.000
Yeah. Why?

19:18.419 --> 19:20.420
All right.
Get dressed.

19:20.505 --> 19:21.755
Go on.

19:31.408 --> 19:33.879
You know, I had plans
tonight with a friend.

19:34.765 --> 19:37.383
All right, call your Willy,

19:37.400 --> 19:38.911
all right? And tell him
you can't make it.

19:38.972 --> 19:39.921
Why?

19:39.973 --> 19:41.106
Because I want
you to proofread

19:41.191 --> 19:42.391
some pages of my book.

19:44.427 --> 19:46.361
I'll pay ya.

19:46.429 --> 19:48.597
I'll make it up
to you, em, I promise.

19:48.648 --> 19:51.150
Well, you can start by
dropping the Willy joke.

19:51.234 --> 19:54.536
Done.

19:54.604 --> 19:55.771
All right.

19:55.822 --> 19:58.440
So, you actually
wrote some pages.

19:58.491 --> 20:01.460
I've got a little
problem, em.

20:01.544 --> 20:03.378
Semicolons.

20:03.446 --> 20:04.646
I never understood them.

20:04.714 --> 20:06.515
But you use them anyway.

20:07.834 --> 20:09.334
Hey, em.

20:09.419 --> 20:10.669
Hey, Gillian.

20:13.807 --> 20:15.891
They snuck this into my house

20:15.958 --> 20:18.594
while Emily was there
alone, doors locked.

20:18.645 --> 20:21.063
That ex-S.R.P. member is
going to be here tomorrow.

20:21.130 --> 20:22.147
Maybe she can help us.

20:22.232 --> 20:23.298
These bastards
are going down.

20:23.349 --> 20:24.316
You mark my words.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.684
Cal.

20:27.804 --> 20:29.822
Whatever people
may feel personally

20:29.906 --> 20:32.641
about John Stafford
and S.R.P.,

20:32.692 --> 20:34.610
it's been a great help
in my life.

20:34.661 --> 20:36.111
And in a lot
of people's lives.

20:36.162 --> 20:38.413
And John would
never hurt anyone.

20:38.481 --> 20:40.499
But you left S.R.P.,

20:40.583 --> 20:41.583
why?

20:41.651 --> 20:43.452
You can leave
whenever you want.

20:43.503 --> 20:46.755
When your course work is
finished, it's time to move on.

20:46.823 --> 20:48.924
Broken eye contact,
hesitation.

20:48.992 --> 20:51.026
That's a straight
up lie, Jane.

20:51.094 --> 20:52.761
No, it's not.

20:52.829 --> 20:55.264
I still embrace
the precepts,

20:55.331 --> 20:57.516
but I choose to live
my own life now.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.767
Precepts?

20:58.835 --> 21:00.786
Defensive.

21:00.854 --> 21:02.204
She feels attacked.

21:02.272 --> 21:03.972
I'm not trying
to attack you,

21:04.023 --> 21:06.692
but from the look
in your eye,

21:06.776 --> 21:09.111
you got a story to tell.

21:14.534 --> 21:15.951
He's in.

21:17.337 --> 21:21.189
I knew John...
In the beginning.

21:23.610 --> 21:28.997
S.R.P. started off as...
A beautiful thing,

21:29.065 --> 21:32.668
just a few of us
exchanging ideas

21:32.719 --> 21:34.586
on how we could
change our lives.

21:34.654 --> 21:37.840
People got interested
and more people came.

21:37.891 --> 21:41.009
We were doing
something special.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.262
We were helping them.

21:43.346 --> 21:45.347
And then what happened?

21:46.900 --> 21:48.984
Money.

21:49.051 --> 21:52.771
And more money, eh?

21:52.856 --> 21:56.825
You hate the money,
don't ya?

21:56.893 --> 21:58.660
Ruined everything.

22:01.664 --> 22:04.416
It changed John.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.586
He appointed himself
our leader.

22:07.670 --> 22:10.389
My boyfriend at
the time, Martin,

22:10.456 --> 22:12.758
he was the first
one to leave.

22:12.842 --> 22:16.244
So, where's Martin now?

22:17.680 --> 22:19.298
There was a fire.

22:20.316 --> 22:22.684
The police said
it was an accident.

22:22.752 --> 22:25.520
John said it was
Martin's own negativity

22:25.588 --> 22:28.423
that lit the fire
that killed him.

22:28.474 --> 22:30.091
You blame Stafford.

22:31.895 --> 22:33.362
You blame mine.

22:33.429 --> 22:35.647
Blame is a very
negative term.

22:35.732 --> 22:37.199
You blame yourself.

22:37.266 --> 22:38.200
I blame no one.

22:38.267 --> 22:39.651
You blame everyone.

22:43.039 --> 22:44.740
Head down, eyes down,

22:44.807 --> 22:46.491
blocking the eyes
with the hand.

22:46.576 --> 22:48.210
Shame.

22:48.277 --> 22:51.663
Were you what they
call an initiate?

22:51.748 --> 22:53.081
What are you suggesting?

22:53.132 --> 22:54.633
You're the one who's
doing that, darling.

22:54.717 --> 22:56.385
You still love him.

22:56.452 --> 22:57.586
I will always love Martin.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.421
I'm not talking about
Martin and you know that.

22:59.472 --> 23:01.506
Stafford's done
with you though, right?

23:01.591 --> 23:02.925
He's through.

23:02.976 --> 23:04.676
How old are you?

23:04.761 --> 23:05.761
I'm 37.

23:05.812 --> 23:07.596
You're outraged at the fact

23:07.647 --> 23:11.850
that you're being replaced
by younger women, right?

23:11.935 --> 23:14.236
You ever thought of suicide?

23:16.973 --> 23:18.490
Shame again.

23:19.492 --> 23:21.526
Send this one on to Florida

23:21.611 --> 23:24.079
before she goes running
back to Stafford.

23:25.498 --> 23:27.366
Stafford's a narcissist.

23:27.433 --> 23:28.700
He's his own weak spot

23:28.785 --> 23:30.252
and we just have to wait
and he'll trip himself up.

23:30.319 --> 23:31.336
There's no time for that.

23:31.421 --> 23:32.921
He had his thugs break
into my house.

23:32.989 --> 23:35.674
I called him a narcissist
and you make this about you?

23:35.758 --> 23:37.759
Oh, that reminds me.

23:37.827 --> 23:42.381
I want a big wanky picture of
myself to put up in my office.

23:42.465 --> 23:45.183
Can you just wait
until I get my purse?

23:46.469 --> 23:50.639
You know, it's easy
to be negative.

23:50.690 --> 23:57.062
Everything around us is designed
to make us think negatively.

23:57.146 --> 23:59.180
But guess what?

23:59.232 --> 24:00.549
We ain't buying it.

24:00.616 --> 24:01.616
We ain't buying it.

24:01.684 --> 24:02.534
Go on, say it.

24:02.618 --> 24:05.020
We ain't buying it.

24:05.088 --> 24:06.521
We ain't buying
because we know the truth

24:06.572 --> 24:07.990
that can't be
bought or sold.

24:09.826 --> 24:12.294
Young lady, would
you come up here?

24:12.361 --> 24:15.213
Ha ha ha. Welcome.

24:15.298 --> 24:17.549
Mind your back.
That's it.

24:17.633 --> 24:19.584
How long have you
been with us?

24:19.669 --> 24:20.585
11 months.

24:20.670 --> 24:21.920
11 months. And
how's that going?

24:22.005 --> 24:22.888
Thank you.

24:22.972 --> 24:24.473
I'm on the fourth
transition.

24:24.540 --> 24:25.757
Where's Carol?

24:25.842 --> 24:28.643
I don't know.
No one's seen her.

24:28.711 --> 24:31.313
Right. Excuse me.

24:31.380 --> 24:33.048
S.R.P. is the best
thing I've ever done.

24:33.099 --> 24:34.049
Come on, you
can say it.

24:34.100 --> 24:35.684
It's ok, you're
with family now.

24:35.735 --> 24:38.020
S.R.P.'s. the best
thing I've ever done.

24:38.071 --> 24:39.237
Ha ha ha.
Whoo!

24:41.190 --> 24:42.607
She's disappeared?

24:43.496 --> 24:44.616
Yeah. And he knows it.

24:53.668 --> 24:55.469
Dr. John.

24:56.344 --> 24:58.195
Carol Ashland?

24:58.207 --> 25:00.541
Any news?

25:00.626 --> 25:03.244
Would you excuse me?

25:05.130 --> 25:06.581
Ahem.

25:07.866 --> 25:11.919
Um...I don't know
where Carol Ashland is.

25:12.004 --> 25:15.973
That's the truth
and you know it.

25:19.544 --> 25:23.314
You want to know why
you get on my nerves?

25:23.381 --> 25:24.849
I'm going
to tell you anyway.

25:24.900 --> 25:29.086
Although I don't see
any lies on your face,

25:29.154 --> 25:34.158
also, I can't
see any truth.

25:37.880 --> 25:40.564
Look, I'm sure you thought
you were helping

25:40.616 --> 25:42.566
Carol by coming here,
Dr. Lightman.

25:44.453 --> 25:49.406
Any fear for her safety?

25:52.461 --> 25:54.562
I can't even
see that, can you?

25:54.630 --> 25:56.413
Maybe Danielle
knows something.

25:56.465 --> 25:58.966
Carol's daughter,
Danielle?

25:59.051 --> 26:01.319
It's just the way you said
Danielle's name just now,

26:01.386 --> 26:04.055
you seem more familiar with
her than her own mother does.

26:04.106 --> 26:10.962
See, you know, even though
I don't get sweet F.A.

26:11.029 --> 26:16.784
from your face...Huh?

26:16.868 --> 26:18.769
That's a classic, that is.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.109
Ahem.

26:26.778 --> 26:29.647
Were you ever
a member of S.R.P.?

26:31.216 --> 26:33.834
Not really a question,
that one, love.

26:33.919 --> 26:38.455
So...on you go.

26:39.958 --> 26:41.859
How did you find out?

26:41.927 --> 26:43.394
Stafford.

26:43.462 --> 26:44.395
He told you?

26:44.463 --> 26:46.397
In a manner
of speaking, yeah.

26:48.133 --> 26:51.435
I was in S.R.P.
until a few months ago.

26:51.486 --> 26:53.938
It just wasn't for me.

26:53.989 --> 26:57.274
What did he do to you?

26:59.411 --> 27:03.914
I was in the core group,
an initiate.

27:05.400 --> 27:08.602
We had sex every day
for nearly a year.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.155
I'd be in the middle
of something and someone

27:11.206 --> 27:13.708
would say John wanted
to see me, so I'd go.

27:13.792 --> 27:16.961
Anytime, night or day.

27:17.029 --> 27:19.296
Sometimes you wouldn't even
know where you were going.

27:19.348 --> 27:22.767
They'd send a jet and fly
you back in the morning.

27:24.436 --> 27:26.687
At first I liked it.

27:26.772 --> 27:29.106
I was proud of myself.

27:30.359 --> 27:34.445
I felt like I was better
than the rest of the women.

27:35.597 --> 27:39.784
But then I saw myself...

27:41.787 --> 27:44.622
What I was really doing.

27:46.008 --> 27:50.294
It got bad...really bad.

27:53.131 --> 27:59.887
Some nights...I would
just...scratch myself.

28:01.390 --> 28:03.240
My face.

28:04.559 --> 28:06.927
I wanted to be ugly.

28:07.012 --> 28:10.014
I didn't want him
to touch me.

28:11.016 --> 28:13.050
But you didn't leave.

28:13.118 --> 28:14.435
You couldn't.

28:14.503 --> 28:18.439
It feels like there's
no world outside S.R.P.

28:18.523 --> 28:24.178
So, you come
to see us about your mum?

28:24.246 --> 28:27.148
But it's not just her.

28:28.166 --> 28:29.950
I want to kill him.

28:30.018 --> 28:32.787
Well, it could cost you
a little extra.

28:36.425 --> 28:39.243
What are you
so excited about?

28:44.716 --> 28:46.517
John Stafford
loves a close-up.

28:46.584 --> 28:48.219
Everything's right here.

28:48.270 --> 28:49.787
He's just hard to pin down,

28:49.855 --> 28:51.889
all the distorted
micro expressions,

28:51.940 --> 28:53.641
so I isolated
the most obvious examples.

28:53.725 --> 28:56.093
Stop. Pan on the left.

28:56.144 --> 28:57.478
Go back.

28:57.562 --> 28:59.764
All right, there.

28:59.831 --> 29:02.233
Subcutaneous
muscle damage.

29:02.284 --> 29:04.452
No wonder we couldn't
get a read on him.

29:04.519 --> 29:06.921
Do you care to take a guess?

29:06.988 --> 29:08.239
Surgery.

29:08.290 --> 29:09.940
I was already there.

29:09.991 --> 29:11.158
All right,
well, calm down

29:11.243 --> 29:12.827
because this is the first
time I've seen these.

29:12.894 --> 29:14.495
Do you want to see what
he looked like before?

29:14.579 --> 29:15.679
Yeah, fire away.

29:19.017 --> 29:21.802
Blimey, no wonder we
couldn't get a read on him.

29:21.887 --> 29:24.472
Meet Carl Weatherly
from Ontario.

29:24.556 --> 29:28.559
Wanted by the R.C.N.P. since
1989 for vehicular manslaughter.

29:28.626 --> 29:31.095
Leaving a wife and a kid.

29:31.163 --> 29:34.315
John Stafford
is not John Stafford.

29:42.974 --> 29:44.859
Thank you.

29:44.943 --> 29:47.778
Thank you.

29:47.829 --> 29:54.268
You are about to begin the
greatest journey of your life.

29:55.787 --> 29:57.371
Look around you.

29:57.455 --> 30:00.875
Meet your new family.

30:00.959 --> 30:05.763
These people will
be with you forever.

30:07.132 --> 30:10.351
Will be with me forever.

30:10.435 --> 30:13.354
Well, by forever, all right,

30:13.438 --> 30:17.441
what John means is for
as long as he needs a family,

30:17.508 --> 30:23.697
you know or you
or whoever, really.

30:23.782 --> 30:25.065
Excuse me, Dr. Lightman.

30:25.150 --> 30:26.200
How you doing John?
You all right, mate?

30:26.284 --> 30:27.684
Nice pants.

30:27.736 --> 30:31.906
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce you

30:31.990 --> 30:39.196
to John's wife Sandy and
his lovely daughter, Liz.

30:39.247 --> 30:42.049
What do you think, girls?

30:42.133 --> 30:44.668
Who've been kind enough
to join us from Toronto,

30:44.719 --> 30:47.004
where they've been living...

30:47.072 --> 30:49.340
Since he abandoned
them 14 years ago.

30:56.765 --> 30:58.933
Whoo!

31:02.997 --> 31:03.217
This is the Stafford family...

31:03.830 --> 31:06.370
Or rather
the Weatherly family,

31:06.858 --> 31:10.694
as Mr. Stafford was known
before he had to leave town.

31:10.745 --> 31:12.195
Lovely family.

31:12.246 --> 31:15.832
John...you were
very handsome.

31:15.900 --> 31:19.035
Let's, uh...
Let's take a break.

31:20.087 --> 31:21.705
Oh, I think we've been
invited backstage,

31:21.756 --> 31:24.958
which rumor has it, is a rare
honor, you know what I mean?

31:25.042 --> 31:27.761
Re-pattern
amongst yourselves.

31:29.413 --> 31:31.014
Could you clear
this area, please?

31:31.081 --> 31:33.300
Please, now.

31:41.943 --> 31:45.478
Well, go on then...
say something.

31:45.563 --> 31:48.415
You talk for
a living, don't ya?

31:49.767 --> 31:52.202
They came all this way.

31:55.840 --> 31:59.659
Sandy...Liz.

31:59.727 --> 32:01.611
Dad.

32:02.697 --> 32:04.347
I'm really sorry.

32:04.415 --> 32:06.416
I was wrong to leave,

32:06.484 --> 32:08.418
but I'm a different
person now.

32:08.486 --> 32:09.469
Wrong to leave?

32:09.553 --> 32:11.054
Just wrong?

32:11.121 --> 32:13.240
So, everything's good now?

32:13.307 --> 32:15.992
And young and stupid.

32:16.060 --> 32:20.964
I thought you'd be better off
without me, I really did.

32:22.132 --> 32:24.100
No, he believes that.

32:24.151 --> 32:27.604
He's probably
standing there

32:27.655 --> 32:33.994
trying to figure out how to
spin this into a positive.

32:34.078 --> 32:36.646
I don't have
to listen to this.

32:39.483 --> 32:42.836
She never stopped
waiting for you.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.171
Even when she
went to college,

32:45.256 --> 32:48.959
she'd call to ask
if you'd come home.

32:49.010 --> 32:51.094
Not even a letter.

32:53.097 --> 32:55.015
Nothing.

32:55.099 --> 32:58.101
You just disappeared,
you son of a bitch.

32:59.270 --> 33:00.687
I thought you were dead.

33:00.771 --> 33:04.024
I hoped you were dead.

33:04.091 --> 33:07.043
I told Liz you had died,
but she didn't believe it.

33:07.111 --> 33:10.130
She always believed that she
was going to see you again.

33:10.197 --> 33:16.286
You left us
with nothing, Carl.

33:18.289 --> 33:20.857
Nothing.

33:27.631 --> 33:29.666
You're seeing this
for the first time...

33:31.218 --> 33:35.455
But I've been living
with it for 14 years.

33:38.709 --> 33:41.227
Come on. Let's go.

33:42.813 --> 33:44.147
No.

33:51.822 --> 33:58.244
This, John Stafford,
is your life.

33:59.180 --> 34:01.114
The only crime
I've committed,

34:01.198 --> 34:02.298
the only wrong
I've done--

34:02.366 --> 34:04.501
abandoning a woman
and her child,

34:04.568 --> 34:07.337
was done out of youthful
ignorance and stupidity.

34:07.404 --> 34:10.040
The only crime my ass.

34:10.107 --> 34:13.409
You're wanted
by the Mounties, mate.

34:14.512 --> 34:15.879
That matter
was resolved.

34:15.929 --> 34:16.980
Oh, really?

34:17.047 --> 34:19.382
Well, I'll get right
on that one, shall I?

34:19.433 --> 34:21.618
No extra charge.

34:21.685 --> 34:26.688
Look, I've got a new family
that I need to protect.

34:26.757 --> 34:31.728
So, for all
their sakes, just go.

34:31.795 --> 34:35.065
I'll take care
of my family and...

34:35.116 --> 34:37.967
You take care
of your family.

34:43.791 --> 34:47.025
Are you saying something
about my family, mate?

34:53.734 --> 34:55.251
Emily?

34:56.920 --> 34:58.254
Em!

35:00.124 --> 35:02.242
The people who are
problems in our lives

35:02.309 --> 35:05.595
will re-program also,
become less negative.

35:05.646 --> 35:08.848
We change others
by changing ourselves.

35:08.933 --> 35:11.684
We find ourselves placing
expectations on others,

35:11.769 --> 35:14.154
which reflect our fears and
have nothing to do with...

35:14.221 --> 35:18.942
Oy, get out here.
Now, both of ya.

35:26.333 --> 35:28.368
We were just
experimenting, dad.

35:28.452 --> 35:30.086
Did you bring her
in here with this bullocks?

35:30.154 --> 35:32.321
We were trying to understand
the type of person

35:32.373 --> 35:33.740
who would
be attracted to that.

35:33.808 --> 35:37.844
Don't play with fire, all right?
Neither of ya, ever.

35:37.928 --> 35:40.230
Dad, seriously.

35:40.297 --> 35:44.384
All right, take her up to my
office and stay there, all right?

35:44.468 --> 35:45.334
Both of ya.

35:45.386 --> 35:47.270
I'll be back in
a couple of hours.

35:47.337 --> 35:49.589
You got it?

36:19.253 --> 36:20.203
Uhh!

36:20.254 --> 36:21.370
Give me the keys,
give me the keys.

36:21.422 --> 36:22.305
Give me the keys.
Uhh! Unh!

36:22.372 --> 36:25.558
I don't need
anymore pamphlets, mate.

36:25.643 --> 36:26.593
Unh!

36:26.677 --> 36:28.178
Now, I'm keeping this,
huh? For the police.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.096
Right, you can walk back
to the bloody mother ship.

36:30.181 --> 36:31.764
Ok.

36:31.832 --> 36:33.016
If I see you
in my neighborhood

36:33.067 --> 36:35.818
or anywhere else for
that matter, ever again,

36:35.886 --> 36:38.821
right, that tire iron is going
to have a mind of its own.

36:38.889 --> 36:40.857
- You get me?
- I hear you, yes.

36:40.908 --> 36:42.375
Now, you tell John
Stafford this is over.

36:42.443 --> 36:43.660
Ok, it's over.

36:43.727 --> 36:46.896
But not in
a negative way, ok?

36:46.947 --> 36:47.881
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:47.948 --> 36:49.249
Uhh!
Marvelous.

36:49.333 --> 36:50.750
Now, sod off.

37:27.692 --> 37:29.509
Aah!

37:40.574 --> 37:41.908
You all right, mate?

37:45.979 --> 37:48.665
The trouble with hubris,
Mr. Weatherly,

37:48.749 --> 37:50.416
you know, we hold
on to stuff.

37:50.484 --> 37:52.235
Things we shouldn't.

37:52.303 --> 37:54.620
And we keep them in places

37:54.672 --> 37:58.374
where if anyone knows
our original name,

37:58.459 --> 37:59.959
they can find them.

38:00.010 --> 38:01.711
Where's my property?

38:01.795 --> 38:03.713
Where's
my private papers?

38:03.797 --> 38:06.265
Cops took the lot, mate.

38:09.269 --> 38:11.938
What was this
place for then?

38:12.005 --> 38:15.775
Was it like a record
of your life history,

38:15.842 --> 38:18.528
you know, for prosperity?

38:18.612 --> 38:21.948
You plunker, you didn't
even divorce Sandy, did ya?

38:22.015 --> 38:23.483
That's going to cost you
an arm and a leg, man.

38:23.534 --> 38:25.785
S.R.P. was never
about the money.

38:25.852 --> 38:27.019
Oh, what was it about then?

38:27.071 --> 38:30.073
We helped thousands
of people.

38:30.157 --> 38:33.659
What about all the other ones?

38:35.562 --> 38:37.330
Did you find
Carol Ashland?

38:37.381 --> 38:40.249
She ran away from you.

38:40.334 --> 38:44.087
She was probably scared
that she'd have another go

38:44.171 --> 38:46.539
at herself if
she stuck around you.

38:46.590 --> 38:49.208
What, do you think I had something
to do with Carol's suicide attempt?

38:49.259 --> 38:54.380
Taking an overdose in
your office, at your desk.

38:54.431 --> 38:58.518
Saying good-bye
to her daughter on your phone,

38:58.569 --> 39:00.186
what was that about then?

39:00.237 --> 39:02.522
I don't know, I...

39:02.573 --> 39:04.741
You ran away
from your family

39:04.808 --> 39:07.910
and a manslaughter
charge in Canada.

39:07.995 --> 39:13.116
Did you ever think
of just manning up?

39:15.002 --> 39:16.786
Oh, well,
here's your chance.

39:16.870 --> 39:23.543
We'll call this the
eighth transition to jail.

39:23.594 --> 39:26.179
First precept, knife,

39:26.246 --> 39:29.682
the nastiest bastards
you can find in there

39:29.749 --> 39:31.100
within your first day.

39:31.185 --> 39:34.270
After that, I heard
they leave you alone.

39:50.654 --> 39:51.704
William?

39:51.771 --> 39:54.040
Dr. Lightman.

39:54.107 --> 39:56.292
Right well, then.

39:57.711 --> 39:59.328
Dr. Emily?

39:59.413 --> 40:01.047
Dad.

40:14.511 --> 40:15.978
What should we talk
about next then?

40:16.063 --> 40:18.564
Semicolons?

40:18.632 --> 40:21.017
What about sport, eh?

40:21.084 --> 40:22.068
Dad, come on.

40:22.135 --> 40:23.603
Just because he
looks like a jock

40:23.654 --> 40:26.038
doesn't mean that
that's all he is.

40:26.106 --> 40:32.445
All right, Mr. not jock,
semicolons, go.

40:34.014 --> 40:38.117
Well, you can use
a semicolon as a soft period.

40:38.185 --> 40:40.736
By using a semicolon
instead of a period

40:40.804 --> 40:43.923
between two sentences, you
show that those two sentences

40:43.990 --> 40:46.542
have a closer relationship
to each other

40:46.627 --> 40:48.811
than they do to
the sentences around them.

40:51.832 --> 40:56.001
As in, Emily's my
daughter...

40:56.053 --> 40:57.887
Semicolon...

40:57.971 --> 40:59.772
And I'm having a hard time

40:59.839 --> 41:04.010
adjusting to her
being a grown up.

41:04.077 --> 41:06.929
Right.

41:06.997 --> 41:10.550
I'll get tea, then.

41:11.618 --> 41:13.202
Quit your garbage.

41:13.287 --> 41:14.570
Well, some of
that S.R.P. stuff

41:14.655 --> 41:15.738
actually
got me thinking.

41:15.822 --> 41:17.856
I mean, some of it
makes sense.

41:17.908 --> 41:22.128
It's common sense dressed up,
so people want to pay for it.

41:22.195 --> 41:25.047
There's whole shelves at mall
bookstores dedicated to that.

41:25.132 --> 41:27.700
Right, well, the trouble
is men like Stafford,

41:27.751 --> 41:29.201
they prey on you,
they make you feel

41:29.253 --> 41:32.221
like you're lacking something and
that only they have the answer.

41:32.306 --> 41:34.840
Yeah, it sounds like Lightman.

41:37.678 --> 41:41.063
You get a move on?

41:41.131 --> 41:42.932
What's wrong
with the coffee here?

41:43.016 --> 41:44.650
Nothing.

41:47.738 --> 41:52.191
It's a lot to carry,
you know, to have to--

41:52.259 --> 41:54.243
to have to work through.

41:54.311 --> 41:56.796
I don't think I can do it.

41:58.232 --> 42:00.499
I don't know
what to say to her.

42:00.567 --> 42:02.552
What Stafford did
to you, to your mother,

42:02.619 --> 42:05.454
to all those people,
it's horrifying.

42:05.522 --> 42:08.124
But he's a sociopath.

42:11.295 --> 42:13.912
But we push back.

42:13.964 --> 42:18.017
And we hold on
and we push back.

42:18.084 --> 42:22.822
And we get help from people
who really care about us.

42:24.141 --> 42:26.475
So, take this step.

42:42.492 --> 42:44.610
Take all the time
you need, love.
