02:43.689 --> 02:45.645
Marvellous salad.

02:45.809 --> 02:48.767
Marvellous.
May I have a bit more, please?

02:48.929 --> 02:50.647
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, me too.

02:50.809 --> 02:53.243
Count me in. It is divine.

02:59.089 --> 03:02.923
-Tell Sissie everything is excellent.
-She'll be pleased.

03:03.089 --> 03:07.526
And I'll have a little fraction more
of that wonderful salad.

03:07.689 --> 03:08.678
Yes, ma'am.

03:12.569 --> 03:14.287
Is it ready?

03:18.969 --> 03:21.642
-It needs more oregano.
-I put a lot in.

03:21.809 --> 03:24.004
Well, just a touch more.

03:27.089 --> 03:30.286
-Where did you get this?
-Out of your bag.

03:30.449 --> 03:33.759
That's not my bag.
That's the waiter's bag.

03:34.569 --> 03:38.005
Four more salads
for four very hungry people who--

03:38.169 --> 03:41.286
-What's wrong, Mavis?
-Harry, what is this?

03:45.329 --> 03:47.206
That's personal.

03:47.369 --> 03:49.246
What is it?

03:50.049 --> 03:53.280
-It ain't oregano.
-Oh, my God!

03:54.089 --> 03:57.206
-You put this in the veal?
-And the soup.

03:57.369 --> 03:59.803
-No!
-And the salad.

03:59.969 --> 04:03.086
Lord have mercy! Grass!

04:03.929 --> 04:05.442
My grass!

04:05.609 --> 04:08.601
Jesus! You cooked half my stash!

04:12.449 --> 04:15.680
Excuse me, dear.
May I talk with you for a minute?

04:15.849 --> 04:17.885
-Up your kazoo!
-Up my.... Wait.

04:18.048 --> 04:21.564
I'm not trying to be a pest.
I know you're an actress.

04:21.728 --> 04:24.687
-Who are you?
-Skip Donahue. I'm a playwright.

04:24.849 --> 04:27.602
I saw you do a scene
from Romeo and Juliet.

04:27.769 --> 04:32.399
You were wonderful. I'm not just
saying it to be kind. You were lovely.

04:32.569 --> 04:36.039
Get out of my way
or I'll kick you in the nuts.

04:36.209 --> 04:41.841
Kick in the nuts! You're fantastic.
The way you can switch characters.

04:42.009 --> 04:45.319
The difference between this
and Juliet is fabulous.

04:45.489 --> 04:48.879
I know you're not wearing
anything under that coat.

04:49.049 --> 04:52.246
-What?
-I also know you're a shoplifter.

04:52.409 --> 04:55.446
-Part-time.
-Are you some kind of loony tune?

04:55.609 --> 04:59.602
No. I'm the store detective here.
Part-time.

05:03.369 --> 05:06.566
Mrs. R.H. was my best customer too.

05:06.729 --> 05:11.359
Well, I was James' best customer.
He sold me this African gungi '65.

05:11.529 --> 05:15.966
Do you know what you've done?
For a little of this, my girlfriend...

05:16.169 --> 05:19.844
...was gonna let me have her
and two of her girlfriends.

05:20.009 --> 05:22.728
She'll ruin me when she finds out!

05:22.889 --> 05:25.767
-Maybe she'll think it's the wine.
-The wine?

05:25.929 --> 05:29.444
There's no wine in the world that--
Smell that.

05:29.609 --> 05:32.840
This is '65 African gungi
from the motherland.

05:33.009 --> 05:37.321
Understand? It's been soaked
in the earth back home. This is mean!

05:37.489 --> 05:42.279
One joint of this put Southern
California to sleep back in '65.

05:42.449 --> 05:46.442
There was a revolution in '65.
We missed it because of this.

05:46.609 --> 05:50.363
This is bad! And you went
and spread it over everything.

05:50.529 --> 05:53.362
I hope you had fun,
because I ain't gonna.

05:53.529 --> 05:57.807
I saw you pretend to steal that dress.
You even looked guilty.

05:57.969 --> 06:01.200
You're a wonderful actress.
But you didn't know...

06:01.369 --> 06:05.965
...l also saw you take off the dress
and throw it in the trash bin.

06:06.889 --> 06:08.720
Let me get this right...

06:08.889 --> 06:10.242
...shithead!

06:11.849 --> 06:13.248
You kill me.

06:13.409 --> 06:16.845
-You think I was a terrific Juliet--
-You were!

06:17.009 --> 06:22.083
Thanks. And you think that I stole
a dress, and then threw it away!

06:22.249 --> 06:25.366
-Right!
-You think I have nothing on under this?

06:25.529 --> 06:28.168
I know that you don't.

06:37.449 --> 06:39.963
-More wine, sir?
-What is this stuff?

06:40.129 --> 06:43.485
-Domestic '65. Hot, isn't it?
-Was that a good year?

06:43.649 --> 06:45.799
-The best ever.
-It's a bitch.

06:45.969 --> 06:49.086
-What did you say?
-I didn't say nothing, ma'am.

06:52.809 --> 06:57.280
-I'm feeling something very strange.
-That's my leg.

06:59.089 --> 07:02.286
Oh, that's all right.
Hit him again, Harry.

07:02.449 --> 07:05.486
Yes, ma'am.
Hitting you again, Father.

07:05.649 --> 07:09.244
You know, I've never
felt like this before.

07:09.409 --> 07:11.684
You know, I'm.... I'm....

07:11.849 --> 07:13.362
Horny?

07:13.529 --> 07:15.326
-Yes?
-Which reminds me.

07:15.489 --> 07:20.563
There's something I always wanted to
ask someone like you. Do you get much?

07:20.729 --> 07:24.881
Not too often.
Just an occasional glass at dinner.

07:25.049 --> 07:27.563
That's not what she meant.

08:04.809 --> 08:06.527
-Harry.
-Yes, yes, yes.

08:06.689 --> 08:09.408
The most wonderful thing
just happened.

08:09.569 --> 08:11.127
Me too.

08:14.689 --> 08:17.965
She's bad, ain't she?
What are you laughing for?

08:18.129 --> 08:20.723
Harry, I got fired today.

08:20.889 --> 08:23.244
-I got fired too.
-What do you mean?

08:23.409 --> 08:25.286
-I got fired.
-You got fired?

08:25.449 --> 08:27.485
Today? This afternoon?

08:27.649 --> 08:29.719
-Yep.
-Between 3:30 and 4?

08:29.889 --> 08:33.086
Yeah, about that.
What happened? I win a prize?

08:33.249 --> 08:35.604
Harry. This is fantastic!

08:35.769 --> 08:40.126
-Any deaths we can celebrate too?
-Don't you know what I'm saying?

08:40.289 --> 08:42.280
-Skip.
-Hi, Nancy.

08:42.448 --> 08:45.327
-How you doing, honey?
-How you doing, Nancy?

08:45.489 --> 08:48.208
-I'm sitting back there.
-Nancy, hello.

08:48.369 --> 08:51.679
-Okay.
-Harry-- You don't introduce me?

08:51.849 --> 08:54.363
-She's not for you.
-What do you mean?

08:54.529 --> 08:56.884
-Nancy is a fascinating girl.
-Yeah.

08:57.049 --> 09:00.724
She may be the single hottest girl
on the East Side.

09:00.889 --> 09:04.643
But when you wake up,
you'll find she's not very serious.

09:04.809 --> 09:06.686
Neither am l.

09:06.849 --> 09:09.124
Harry, listen to me.

09:09.289 --> 09:13.328
For the first time in our lives,
we're free.

09:13.489 --> 09:16.640
Yeah, free to walk in the cold.
To be ridiculed.

09:16.809 --> 09:18.322
I don't mean that.

09:18.489 --> 09:23.005
I mean we're free to get out
of this city. It's driving me buggy.

09:23.369 --> 09:25.405
What are you trying to pull?

09:25.569 --> 09:28.083
I gave you a $10 bill.
Think I'm crazy?

09:28.249 --> 09:30.399
And it's 8:50 on the clock. Okay?

09:30.569 --> 09:34.244
-You gave me a buck, not 10.
-Bullshit! I gave you a 10!

09:34.409 --> 09:39.403
-Why are you trying to steal from me?
-Get lost, Chico.

09:40.969 --> 09:44.962
See what this city does to people?
They need room to breathe.

09:45.129 --> 09:47.120
They need love, affection!

09:47.289 --> 09:52.522
The little guy needs money. The big
guy needs a two-by-four to his head.

09:52.689 --> 09:57.399
All they need is someone to talk
to them gently, with compassion.

09:57.569 --> 10:01.005
-That's all they need.
-Are you serious? Huh?

10:01.169 --> 10:04.684
I'm serious. That's what
I don't like about this city.

10:04.849 --> 10:07.238
-You're a saint.
-Why make fun of me?

10:07.409 --> 10:11.721
You ought to go over there.
They're gentlemen, they'll understand.

10:11.889 --> 10:17.327
Because you convinced me. Go on over
there, tell them what you told me.

10:22.129 --> 10:24.279
Go on over there.

10:24.969 --> 10:27.642
-Okay.
-Skip, what are you--? Skip!

10:27.809 --> 10:30.562
Skip, don't go over there, man.

10:31.889 --> 10:34.198
-Skip.
-Oh, hi, Lana.

10:42.129 --> 10:43.244
Call me.

10:43.769 --> 10:46.408
Excuse me.
Hold on one second, fellas.

10:46.569 --> 10:49.402
Listen, I know this
is a delicate situation.

10:49.569 --> 10:51.878
But let's talk a little sense.

10:52.049 --> 10:54.324
Do you really want
to hurt this man?

10:54.489 --> 10:56.127
No, no, not at all.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.723
Do you want more
than what you're due?

10:58.889 --> 11:01.403
-No.
-Then we're halfway home.

11:01.569 --> 11:04.322
Can we work this out
in a civilized manner?

11:04.489 --> 11:05.922
It's okay with me.

11:08.049 --> 11:10.404
By the way, sir, what is your name?

11:12.529 --> 11:13.882
Alex.

11:14.409 --> 11:16.684
Alex. And you, sir?

11:16.849 --> 11:19.602
-My name is Chico.
-Chico.

11:20.169 --> 11:25.004
Alex, may I present Chico.
Chico, this is Alex.

11:25.169 --> 11:26.887
How do you do?

11:30.209 --> 11:32.677
Wallet. Wallet.

11:32.849 --> 11:35.363
Okay. Okay.

11:38.169 --> 11:40.729
-Here. Here.
-Hey, thanks, sir.

11:40.889 --> 11:44.325
-Does this include the tip?
-Yes. Have it all. Okay?

11:44.489 --> 11:45.888
Thanks a lot.

11:46.049 --> 11:49.598
I'll leave you. You seem
to have a friendship starting.

11:49.769 --> 11:52.124
-Have a nice evening.
-Thank you.

11:52.289 --> 11:55.008
-So long, fellas.
-So long.

11:55.209 --> 11:56.767
Take care.

11:59.049 --> 12:01.199
No, no, don't. That--

12:08.969 --> 12:11.563
-Well?
-What if you got hurt, huh?

12:11.729 --> 12:13.367
Did you think about that?

12:13.529 --> 12:19.479
Do you see what can be accomplished
if you get people to make real contact?

12:19.649 --> 12:24.040
The little man had the contact.
He got his point across.

12:24.209 --> 12:27.838
Harry, I don't like it here anymore.
I want to get out.

12:28.009 --> 12:30.477
Let's go where there's some sunshine.

12:30.649 --> 12:34.437
Where there's human feelings.
Tenderness and kindness.

12:34.609 --> 12:39.524
-Where the noise is not so loud.
-You wanna leave New York? Broadway?

12:39.689 --> 12:41.088
You love New York?

12:41.249 --> 12:45.481
I got a callback on a play.
I'm an actor. I'm going to stay.

12:45.649 --> 12:50.723
Harry, you made $35
last year as an actor.

12:51.289 --> 12:54.599
-How much you make as a playwright?
-Nothing.

12:54.769 --> 12:59.399
That's why I want to get out of here.
Let's go. We can head out West.

12:59.569 --> 13:03.198
We could grab odd jobs on the way.
Build up a nest egg.

13:03.369 --> 13:08.318
And then head for Hollywood.
That's the place for us. Picture it.

13:08.489 --> 13:10.684
Harry and Skip in the Sunbelt.

13:10.849 --> 13:15.081
In the Sunbelt, you just smile
and they pour money out on you.

13:15.249 --> 13:19.003
And the women. Oh, God, the women.

13:19.449 --> 13:23.886
Natural, robust, open, carefree...

13:24.049 --> 13:26.927
...uninhibited, healthy.

13:27.089 --> 13:29.728
-Talk some more.
-Okay.

13:29.889 --> 13:32.528
-You can talk shit.
-Okay, picture this.

13:32.689 --> 13:37.365
You and me, and two girls.
Romping through the desert.

13:37.529 --> 13:41.044
Splashing into the ocean.
And the moonlight is out.

13:41.209 --> 13:45.327
We glimpse their bodies
when the moonlight hits their breasts.

13:45.489 --> 13:48.686
We watch those breasts
bounce gently to and fro.

13:48.849 --> 13:52.125
-In the sand?
-After the water, we go in the sand.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.405
-We have a blanket.
-You serious?

13:54.569 --> 13:57.322
-That's what I'm trying to say.
-Let's go!

13:57.489 --> 14:00.003
Okay! California, here I come!

14:49.409 --> 14:51.639
Harry, what's the matter?

14:54.369 --> 14:56.200
-1 50 bucks?
-1 50?

14:56.369 --> 14:58.644
That'll put a dent in our bankroll.

14:58.809 --> 15:02.040
Don't worry.
Jobs shouldn't be hard to find here.

15:02.209 --> 15:04.564
I think this is too much, though.

15:04.729 --> 15:07.766
I have a good feeling
about this town.

15:07.969 --> 15:10.608
I think this is gonna be
our lucky town.

15:10.769 --> 15:13.124
Give me the 5 back, please.

15:14.329 --> 15:15.967
Merry Christmas.

15:56.929 --> 16:00.604
-How did you do on the job front?
-I drew a blank.

16:00.769 --> 16:05.399
Well, I have one possibility.
It's nothing ideal. But it's a start.

16:05.569 --> 16:09.562
Harry, I have something
very important to tell you.

16:09.849 --> 16:13.000
I love this place!
I'm thrilled here, Harry.

16:13.169 --> 16:16.127
I'm telling you, I am....
I'm thrilled.

16:16.289 --> 16:19.725
-I'm thrilled for you.
-You can taste the atmosphere.

16:19.889 --> 16:22.801
Do you know what this will do
for my writing?

16:23.329 --> 16:24.887
See those two guys?

16:25.049 --> 16:28.121
The Sunbelt's history
is written on their faces.

16:28.289 --> 16:30.519
-They'll bring your hat to you.
-Don't worry.

16:30.689 --> 16:35.717
I'd love to talk with those fellows. I
want to try and capture their rhythm.

16:35.889 --> 16:39.802
-It won't take you long. Skip--
-I'll be right back.

16:39.969 --> 16:42.961
Jesus Christ, goddamn! Skip!

16:45.729 --> 16:48.402
Hi. Hi, fellas.

16:49.089 --> 16:52.161
Hello. Hi. How are you?

16:52.329 --> 16:55.480
I'm Skip Donahue. I'm from back East.

16:55.649 --> 16:59.483
Me and my buddy--
My buddy and I just rolled into town.

16:59.649 --> 17:03.722
We were wondering, what is the job
situation like around here?

17:04.329 --> 17:07.401
Wow! That surprised me.
Do you mind if I try it?

17:11.409 --> 17:12.762
Okay.

17:35.489 --> 17:36.808
Skip!

17:37.769 --> 17:41.557
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I just want to speak to my friend.

17:41.729 --> 17:45.165
-What?
-Socializing with them is hazardous.

17:45.329 --> 17:48.401
-They're nice guys.
-They'll take your head off.

17:48.569 --> 17:52.687
-Tell me about the job opportunity.
-It's in banking.

17:52.849 --> 17:56.205
-We don't know about banking.
-We don't have to.

17:56.369 --> 18:00.044
I've sold the manager
on a new promotion idea.

18:00.569 --> 18:03.481
Oh, you'll save money
Knock on wood

18:03.649 --> 18:06.959
When you do what
A good woodpecker should

18:07.129 --> 18:09.882
Save for a horse
Or a brand-new ranch

18:10.049 --> 18:13.598
When you flock to the
Glenboro Savings branch

18:13.769 --> 18:17.000
You can feather your nest
With frills

18:17.169 --> 18:20.445
Fill your garage
With Coup de Villes

18:20.609 --> 18:24.238
Just relax if you have a big bill

18:24.409 --> 18:26.525
Are you really a woodpecker?

18:26.689 --> 18:29.886
No, I'm just a man pretending
to be a woodpecker.

18:30.049 --> 18:32.438
That's a real woodpecker.

18:34.369 --> 18:37.759
Be a smart bird too

18:37.929 --> 18:41.239
You little pecker, you

18:45.889 --> 18:50.565
You gotta admit, for an interim gig,
this really wasn't bad.

18:50.729 --> 18:53.846
Oh, you'll save money
Knock on wood

19:10.609 --> 19:12.804
You'll save money
Knock on wood

19:12.969 --> 19:15.802
When you do what
A good woodpecker should

19:16.249 --> 19:18.922
Save for a horse
Or a brand-new ranch

19:19.089 --> 19:22.525
When you flock to the
Glenboro Savings--

19:25.409 --> 19:27.843
Get down on the floor.

19:53.929 --> 19:57.001
Stay where you are
and nobody gets hurt.

20:30.609 --> 20:33.043
-Looks like trouble.
-What happened?

20:33.289 --> 20:36.122
-Let's not find out.
-It might be important.

20:36.289 --> 20:37.563
Skip!

20:46.729 --> 20:49.368
Would you mind looking
at some mug shots?

20:49.529 --> 20:52.123
Maybe you can identify those guys.

20:54.289 --> 20:57.679
-There they are! The New Yorkers!
-Can we help?

20:57.849 --> 20:59.601
Is that your van?

21:00.449 --> 21:04.681
-No, sir. It doesn't belong to me.
-Yes, sir. What are you doing?

21:04.849 --> 21:09.081
-This is my first frisk.
-Why are you searching me?

21:09.249 --> 21:13.083
-I hope you're enjoying this shit.
-What are you doing?

21:15.289 --> 21:18.998
Welcome to the desert.
But I don't see no naked women.

21:19.169 --> 21:21.319
I shouldn't have listened to you.

21:21.489 --> 21:24.447
-Grandma was right. Shit for brains!
-Me?

21:24.609 --> 21:26.201
No, me!

21:32.089 --> 21:34.239
-What are you doing?
-Getting bad.

21:34.409 --> 21:38.004
You better get bad.
If you ain't, you'll get fucked.

21:38.169 --> 21:41.047
You bad, they don't mess with you.

21:42.369 --> 21:45.486
-Hey, home, get down.
-Hey.

21:46.329 --> 21:48.763
You a little too bad, ain't you?

21:49.009 --> 21:50.488
Yeah.

21:51.169 --> 21:53.160
Do some of these.

22:06.289 --> 22:09.201
That's right, that's right, we bad.

22:09.369 --> 22:13.442
That's right. We don't want
no shit, either. That's right.

22:13.609 --> 22:15.042
Darn right.

22:15.449 --> 22:18.282
We don't want no shit, you understand?

22:18.449 --> 22:23.318
We don't take too much shit.
We take a little, but no monster shit.

22:23.489 --> 22:24.922
Damn right!

22:25.089 --> 22:27.649
-That's right. Say, " No shit."
-No shit!

22:27.809 --> 22:30.801
That's right, no shit. No.
Try it again.

22:30.969 --> 22:33.164
-We don't take no shit.
-No shit.

22:33.329 --> 22:34.967
No shit.

22:35.529 --> 22:39.647
-And we ain't shitting.
-You better believe it, baby.

23:11.009 --> 23:13.569
What the hell's wrong with him?

23:17.809 --> 23:22.405
Oh, shit. Skip?
Skip, come on, man.

23:25.009 --> 23:26.681
Come on.

23:37.489 --> 23:39.957
Carry me back to old Virginia, Lord.

23:40.129 --> 23:41.847
Did you get it?

23:44.729 --> 23:47.766
Oh. There it is.

23:47.929 --> 23:51.683
Right on the end of your nose.

24:14.969 --> 24:17.164
Sinsemilla!

24:29.689 --> 24:32.157
Oh, shit!

24:33.089 --> 24:35.080
Give him a light.

24:36.009 --> 24:39.797
-Give me a light.
-He wants a light.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.241
Right on.

24:45.769 --> 24:47.839
The man wants a light.

24:49.009 --> 24:50.328
A light.

24:59.329 --> 25:02.799
It doesn't....
Don't.... Just doesn't....

25:04.489 --> 25:06.719
Oh, shit.

25:07.769 --> 25:10.203
Oh, shit.

25:12.809 --> 25:18.122
-Short-ass son of a bitch, ain't you?
-Oh, I'm a short son of a bitch.

25:18.289 --> 25:21.281
My father was a short
son of a bitch too.

25:21.449 --> 25:23.917
My mother was shorter than him.

25:24.089 --> 25:29.117
And my brother was real short, and we
couldn't even see him. He was short.

25:29.289 --> 25:31.883
-What's the charge?
-I'm innocent.

25:32.049 --> 25:34.483
-Ain't we all.
-Bank robbery.

25:35.209 --> 25:38.360
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, shit!

25:39.169 --> 25:41.763
You can kiss the baby.

25:43.569 --> 25:45.287
Kiss the baby?

25:45.929 --> 25:47.521
What baby is that, sir?

25:47.929 --> 25:49.521
Ask your lawyer.

25:49.689 --> 25:51.645
Kiss the baby?

25:52.649 --> 25:53.764
-Hi.
-Hi.

25:53.929 --> 25:56.921
-I'm Slowpoke.
-Hi. Slowpoke, this is Harry.

25:57.089 --> 26:01.082
This state gives long sentences,
especially for bank robbing.

26:01.249 --> 26:05.128
Don't wet your pants. They have
a liberal good-time program.

26:05.289 --> 26:07.962
If the bottom drops out
from under you...

26:08.169 --> 26:11.161
...that's one bright spot
to look forward to.

26:12.729 --> 26:16.244
-Okay. Okay.
-What is he talking about?

26:16.409 --> 26:19.367
-What did he say?
-I don't know what he said.

26:19.529 --> 26:22.202
He said if the bottom falls out.

26:22.369 --> 26:27.443
This filthy, roach-ridden reality
is inspiring.

26:29.649 --> 26:32.880
What did that cop say
when he grabbed your throat?

26:33.049 --> 26:37.042
-I don't fucking believe you!
-" I don't fucking believe you."

26:37.209 --> 26:39.359
-Fabulous!
-You don't get it.

26:39.529 --> 26:42.362
Think this is
The Count of Monte Cristo?

26:42.529 --> 26:45.646
This is the real deal.
We're in deep shit.

26:45.809 --> 26:49.358
You and I are innocent.
You know that. I know that.

26:49.529 --> 26:53.727
The two guys who really pulled
that bank job know it too.

26:53.889 --> 26:55.925
But the cops don't know it!

26:56.089 --> 26:58.125
Donahue. Monroe.

26:58.289 --> 27:02.601
-I am entitled to a private interview.
-Forget it.

27:07.209 --> 27:09.677
-Are you here for us?
-I believe so.

27:09.849 --> 27:13.080
I'm Skip Donahue.
This is my buddy, Harry Monroe.

27:13.249 --> 27:17.003
-I'm Len Garber, your lawyer.
-It's a pleasure to see you.

27:17.169 --> 27:21.242
Call my girlfriend, Cindy Laurence.
They won't let me.

27:21.409 --> 27:23.445
-It's important to him.
-I will.

27:23.609 --> 27:27.488
-Say we're at our cousins.
-There's been a misunderstanding.

27:27.649 --> 27:30.686
I am more or less familiar
with the case.

27:30.849 --> 27:32.646
You know we're innocent?

27:32.809 --> 27:35.801
Can't you just cut through
all this garbage?

27:35.969 --> 27:39.200
This isn't funny.
Do they know I hate confinement?

27:39.369 --> 27:44.443
They don't care. I can only shower
them with motions. I've filed two.

27:44.609 --> 27:47.077
-Only two?
-How about a dozen on me?

27:47.249 --> 27:49.763
We're dealing with robbery
and assault.

27:49.929 --> 27:52.682
You might as well have
burned the Pentagon!

27:54.249 --> 27:56.558
Will the defendants rise?

27:58.089 --> 28:01.718
Considering the arguments
presented by both counsel...

28:02.009 --> 28:04.045
...and after deliberation...

28:04.209 --> 28:07.519
...l find the defendants
guilty as charged.

28:07.689 --> 28:11.364
Do you wish to waive the right
to a pre-sentence hearing?

28:11.529 --> 28:12.928
-No.
-Yes, Your Honour.

28:13.089 --> 28:16.365
Considering the ruthless nature
of this crime...

28:16.529 --> 28:19.601
...and the bleak prospects
for rehabilitation...

28:19.769 --> 28:23.205
...l hereby sentence you
to serve 1 25 years...

28:23.369 --> 28:28.284
...in the custody of the commissioner
of the Department of Corrections.

28:30.289 --> 28:32.405
Wait. No, no, no, wait.

28:32.569 --> 28:34.002
No, no, sit. Sit.

28:34.169 --> 28:37.002
We didn't do it.
There's a misunderstanding.

28:37.169 --> 28:39.000
-Right.
-We didn't do it.

28:39.169 --> 28:42.639
-Our lawyer told us to come up--
-I know I didn't.

28:42.809 --> 28:46.597
He's joking. He means we didn't do it.
We didn't do it.

28:46.769 --> 28:50.648
-Have you got the right case?
-This is Monroe and Donahue.

28:50.809 --> 28:55.405
-Harry Monroe. Look under there.
-Sir.

28:55.569 --> 28:58.129
-A tall, black man--
-Sir, we didn't--

28:58.289 --> 29:01.281
How much does that mean
in actual time?

29:01.449 --> 29:04.361
-Thirty years, tops.
-I'll be a dead old man.

29:04.529 --> 29:07.726
-Thirty years.
-I don't want to do one.

29:07.889 --> 29:11.199
I don't even want to do 100.
I can't....

29:11.369 --> 29:13.405
I'm gonna kill this mother.

29:15.529 --> 29:19.568
-I'm mad about what happened.
-It's not the end of the world.

29:19.729 --> 29:22.960
-What do we do?
-Start your sentence. I'll appeal.

29:23.129 --> 29:27.486
-A hundred and twenty-five years!
-Stop it! It's only 30 years.

29:27.689 --> 29:32.888
Can you get your staff to track down
those guys who really pulled it off?

29:33.049 --> 29:37.281
It's a one-man show. My cousin
is visiting from Massachusetts.

29:37.449 --> 29:39.963
She's a terrific social worker.
Bright.

29:40.129 --> 29:43.007
Oh, 1 25 years.
I won't have grandchildren!

30:12.649 --> 30:14.002
Thanks.

30:27.049 --> 30:31.201
It's chilling. It's frighteningly real.
It's almost surreal.

30:31.369 --> 30:35.487
Will you shut up until we get out
of this mess you got us into?

30:35.729 --> 30:38.562
Let's go. And no slow bucking.

30:38.729 --> 30:42.608
-Sir, how come--?
-Shut up, asshole, and move out!

30:48.769 --> 30:53.763
This is from the Middle Ages.
How do they expect you to move?

30:53.929 --> 30:56.568
I bet this whole thing is illegal.

30:56.729 --> 31:01.007
-Sir, wasn't this whole contraption--?
-Keep moving, turkey!

31:01.169 --> 31:02.887
Get up. Get up!

31:04.329 --> 31:07.639
You're gonna have to learn
the hard way, fella.

31:08.969 --> 31:11.847
I was right.
This is illegal and he knows it.

31:12.209 --> 31:15.007
Jesus! The man
ain't never gonna learn.

31:15.169 --> 31:17.842
Maybe after they hit him a few times.

31:18.009 --> 31:21.763
Just get into the flow of it.
Don't fight the metal.

31:21.929 --> 31:23.806
I'm not. It's fighting me.

31:23.969 --> 31:28.838
-What you up for, Sweetpants?
-We're innocent. I swear we are.

31:29.009 --> 31:31.887
My name ain't no goddamn "Sweetpants."

31:32.049 --> 31:33.801
Holy shit!

31:36.209 --> 31:39.758
-I have the swing of it now. Thanks.
-Sure.

31:39.929 --> 31:42.238
-I'm Skip Donahue.
-Jesus Ramirez.

31:42.409 --> 31:44.639
Nice to meet you.
Why are you here?

31:44.809 --> 31:48.597
I've been here seven years,
away from my beautiful Teresa.

31:48.769 --> 31:51.966
I was in court on an appeal hearing.
Lost again.

31:52.129 --> 31:54.768
They accused me
of robbing several banks.

31:54.929 --> 31:58.922
I was drunk, but I'm positive
I only robbed one bank. You?

31:59.089 --> 32:02.161
My friend and I were doing
a song and dance act.

32:02.329 --> 32:04.638
Must have been pretty bad.

32:12.009 --> 32:15.479
Excuse me. I'm not very good
at these written tests.

32:15.649 --> 32:20.404
I think you'll get much more of my
original flavour in an oral exam--

32:20.569 --> 32:24.721
You know, I'm just about to lose
my patience with you.

32:24.889 --> 32:28.677
-I was trying to explain--
-Keep writing, shitface!

32:33.249 --> 32:35.524
Two pears, three apples....

32:35.689 --> 32:40.399
Listen. A kid tried that on me once
at Camp Minikani in Vermont.

32:40.569 --> 32:44.608
I hit him so hard his braces
ripped his whole upper lip.

32:44.769 --> 32:48.603
His mother had to come get him
in the middle of the season.

33:06.129 --> 33:09.007
-What do they put in the dollhouses?
-Guess.

33:09.169 --> 33:12.400
-Us?
-Yes. You got it on the first try.

33:12.689 --> 33:14.168
-Harry.
-What?

33:15.289 --> 33:18.565
-We're in prison.
-Welcome to the real world!

33:18.729 --> 33:23.564
And not a minute too soon,
I might add. Now, brace up. Be strong.

33:44.169 --> 33:46.000
-Harry.
-What?

33:46.169 --> 33:48.808
I don't think I'm going to make it.

33:49.889 --> 33:53.677
Hang on, man. Don't mess up.
Just think about our appeal.

33:55.209 --> 33:57.404
Skip, please.

34:10.168 --> 34:12.125
Excuse me. Could I please--?

34:12.289 --> 34:15.326
Wait a minute,
I'm not a troublemaker.

34:17.529 --> 34:18.848
Skip.

34:24.289 --> 34:25.608
Skip!

34:26.849 --> 34:28.601
Okay, no more hitting.

34:28.768 --> 34:32.364
Did you hear what I said?
No more hitting. Turn around.

34:32.529 --> 34:34.963
Wanna stay late tonight?
Turn around.

34:35.129 --> 34:39.007
Let's get out of here!
Come on, Silver! Harry, I'm freaking.

34:39.168 --> 34:41.444
Giddyap! So long, suckers!

34:41.609 --> 34:44.521
Hey, Harry, he thinks he's a horse.

34:44.688 --> 34:46.088
Help me! Harry!

34:46.248 --> 34:48.399
Don't hit him! Please, he's sick.

34:48.569 --> 34:52.527
He's having a fit.
He don't have his fit pills.

34:52.688 --> 34:56.648
-He's got them, honest. Vietnam....
-Harry, help me, Harry!

34:56.809 --> 34:58.481
-Skip!
-Help!

35:00.289 --> 35:02.564
Oh, shit, Skip.

35:08.849 --> 35:13.240
It's okay. It's okay.
You did it. You did it.

35:13.409 --> 35:16.845
-He's okay now.
-I'm okay now. It's out of my system.

35:17.009 --> 35:18.203
-You okay?
-Yep.

35:18.369 --> 35:20.360
-He's okay.
-I'm 100 percent.

35:20.529 --> 35:22.121
Please, just this once.

35:22.289 --> 35:25.087
I mean, it's okay. Pretend it's okay.

35:25.249 --> 35:26.602
Okay.

35:26.769 --> 35:28.999
-He's okay, see?
-Yeah, we're okay.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.364
-Okay?
-Yeah.

35:35.569 --> 35:38.641
For God's sake!
You're gonna get us in trouble.

35:38.809 --> 35:42.518
-Harry, it's all right.
-I can't take it! Mama!

35:42.689 --> 35:44.168
-Come here.
-Mama!

35:44.329 --> 35:47.526
Take your pill.
Three seconds, it's over.

35:47.689 --> 35:52.126
One thousand one. One thousand two.
One thousand three. Finished!

35:52.289 --> 35:54.245
Finished!

35:54.409 --> 35:57.606
What did I tell you?
Okay, let's go.

35:57.769 --> 36:00.647
Back in line. Here we go.
Thanks very much.

36:00.849 --> 36:05.320
-Okay! Here we go. What's next?
-This way.

36:11.969 --> 36:14.403
I'd like spareribs, French fries...

36:14.649 --> 36:19.325
...and a big old juicy cheeseburger
on the side with a chocolate malt!

36:19.569 --> 36:20.684
Thanks.

36:21.169 --> 36:24.081
I can get you things,
like a cheeseburger.

36:24.289 --> 36:27.281
I don't want you
to get me no cheeseburger.

36:27.769 --> 36:30.761
-I'll wash your socks.
-Don't wash my socks.

36:30.969 --> 36:34.644
You leave my socks alone, man.
Stay out of my face.

36:41.009 --> 36:42.522
These are delicious.

36:42.729 --> 36:47.519
Aren't you amazed at the quality
of these vegetables? ln a prison?

36:47.729 --> 36:50.607
I'm amazed at what's
crawling in our soup.

36:50.809 --> 36:53.960
-What are you talking about?
-Little creatures.

36:54.169 --> 36:56.046
-Where?
-There.

37:27.169 --> 37:30.684
What's his story?
Why does he get a separate table?

37:30.889 --> 37:36.088
That's Grossberger. The biggest killer
in the history of the Southwest.

37:36.289 --> 37:40.567
He killed his whole family and all
his relatives in one weekend.

37:40.769 --> 37:44.364
Then he killed some people
who reminded him of them.

37:44.569 --> 37:49.085
-He here for rehabilitation?
-He threw the chaplain through a wall...

37:49.289 --> 37:53.168
...burned down the factory.
But he hasn't killed anyone here.

37:53.369 --> 37:57.726
I wouldn't sit with him,
and I killed my stepdaddy.

37:57.929 --> 38:03.720
I wonder what triggered all that
violence. He seems so gentle.

38:23.129 --> 38:24.767
I see what it is.

38:24.969 --> 38:30.965
Nobody has ever just sat down
and honestly talked with that man.

38:34.249 --> 38:39.767
-Poor kid.
-The man's not ready for an interview.

38:55.529 --> 38:56.848
Hello.

39:00.849 --> 39:05.286
I'll wait till after
he's had a little nap.

39:05.489 --> 39:09.368
Do you mind? Why did you
kill your stepfather anyway?

39:09.569 --> 39:14.962
Criticizing my new fur jacket.
And slapping my hand.

39:48.889 --> 39:52.325
-What should we do with him, Jack?
-How late was he?

39:52.529 --> 39:53.962
A week.

39:55.249 --> 40:00.004
You snort up all that nice blow
and then you forget about paying.

40:00.249 --> 40:03.161
Teach him to be punctual.

40:20.689 --> 40:23.681
-What was that all about?
-That's Jack Graham.

40:23.889 --> 40:25.845
You don't mess with him.

40:26.049 --> 40:30.600
-A guard can yank you out like that?
-He's an inmate like you and me.

40:30.809 --> 40:34.085
He runs the cellblock.
Dope, whiskey, a woman.

40:34.289 --> 40:38.680
He can get you anything you want.
And he can get you killed.

40:38.889 --> 40:42.802
Well, I don't want anything from him.

40:42.969 --> 40:48.487
That's Blade. He runs the Third World
side of cellblock two.

40:48.689 --> 40:53.683
Before Grossberger, he held the
axe-murder record in the Southwest.

40:53.889 --> 40:55.686
It's hard to be the best.

40:55.889 --> 40:59.882
He's gonna give me the cheeseburger.
How do you like it?

41:00.089 --> 41:03.684
I don't want a cheeseburger.
I'm watching my weight.

41:03.889 --> 41:05.800
-Don't worry.
-Getting fat.

41:06.009 --> 41:10.878
-I'll protect you. I make him uneasy.
-I wonder why.

41:12.049 --> 41:16.884
Hi. I'm going. Skip, my friend.
Excuse me, would you?

41:17.089 --> 41:19.364
-I'll come with you.
-Oh, shit.

41:22.009 --> 41:26.127
I'm a little nervous.
Did you sleep any better last night?

41:26.329 --> 41:30.038
A little between nightmares.
The walls close in on me.

41:30.249 --> 41:35.118
I know. I have it on the list. Roomier
cells, soap dish, toilet seats--

41:35.329 --> 41:37.479
What are you talking about?

41:41.089 --> 41:43.239
-That's ridiculous.
-Put that on your list.

41:43.449 --> 41:47.362
-I will. Unnecessary violence.
-See what they did to him?

41:47.569 --> 41:49.161
Okay, you two, inside.

41:57.329 --> 42:05.725
-Inmates 65984 and 65985.
-The New Yorkers.

42:05.929 --> 42:08.841
How do you do, sir?
Very nice to meet you.

42:09.049 --> 42:12.280
We'd like to touch--
I think I speak for Harry.

42:12.489 --> 42:14.047
-Would like to--
-No.

42:16.209 --> 42:20.088
Harry's a little nervous,
and I am a little bit too.

42:20.329 --> 42:23.127
This is a different
way of life for us.

42:23.369 --> 42:26.122
We'd like to discuss
with you some ideas...

42:26.369 --> 42:29.327
...we think would make
life easier for all.

42:29.569 --> 42:34.882
-Oh, do we have to listen to this?
-Were you in the middle of something?

42:35.089 --> 42:41.198
No. Mr. Wilson just doesn't feel the
same need to be hospitable as I do.

42:41.449 --> 42:43.326
Get on the bull!

42:43.569 --> 42:47.357
-Get on the ball?
-Get on the bull!

42:48.649 --> 42:54.440
Is that what that is? I didn't know.
Oh, is that a recreational activity?

42:54.649 --> 42:57.288
I was hoping for volleyball or tennis.

42:57.489 --> 43:01.528
We have an annual prison rodeo
we're awfully proud of.

43:01.729 --> 43:05.119
We like to run you new
fellas through a test...

43:05.369 --> 43:08.406
...to see if you have any
aptitude for it.

43:08.609 --> 43:10.247
Sure. Fine with me.

43:10.449 --> 43:14.840
-Be sure we don't miss some rodeo star.
-You don't need me, right?

43:15.049 --> 43:17.040
-You wanna shut up?
-Okay.

43:17.249 --> 43:21.288
-Okay, let her rip.
-You're on backwards.

43:24.249 --> 43:25.364
Okay.

43:28.689 --> 43:31.806
Over the rigging.

43:32.009 --> 43:34.443
I thought you meant the other way.

43:34.649 --> 43:38.358
I was looking for the
horns to come out. Okay.

43:38.569 --> 43:40.525
-You ready, Mr. Wilson?
-Ready.

43:40.769 --> 43:42.441
Proceed.

43:48.169 --> 43:52.208
Harry, you gotta try this.
It's fun.

43:52.409 --> 43:55.606
It's like the merry-go-round
at Coney lsland.

43:55.809 --> 43:57.686
Try two level.

44:05.249 --> 44:09.128
Where's the part where I go,
" Hee-ya"?

44:09.369 --> 44:11.246
Go to three.

44:17.049 --> 44:19.119
This is fun.

44:34.809 --> 44:36.765
Look, Ma. I'm dancing.

44:53.889 --> 44:55.880
Ride it, Skip!

45:07.369 --> 45:10.566
Ride that son of a bitch!

45:37.649 --> 45:38.968
All right.

45:46.649 --> 45:51.359
-Is it all right if I get off now?
-Yes. You can get off now.

45:54.049 --> 45:57.200
You two fellas can
go on back to your cells.

45:57.449 --> 45:58.723
Mr. Barstow!

45:58.929 --> 46:02.638
-We had a nice visit, didn't we?
-Yeah. Mr. Barstow!

46:02.849 --> 46:07.365
Here are the ideas I mentioned.
Why don't you chew on these?

46:07.569 --> 46:10.129
When you're ready, we'll go over them.

46:10.369 --> 46:13.884
-Get rid of them.
-Maybe we can meet for lunch.

46:15.089 --> 46:19.002
-I don't believe what I saw.
-The machine's malfunctioning!

46:19.209 --> 46:22.087
The machine's fine.
You want to try it?

46:22.289 --> 46:24.519
-It was luck.
-He's a born cowboy.

46:24.729 --> 46:27.880
-From New York?
-I don't care where he's from.

46:28.089 --> 46:30.887
No inmate ever took it to six level.

46:31.089 --> 46:36.800
Your big rodeo star, Graham,
never got it past a four.

46:37.049 --> 46:41.088
-Graham's had injuries.
-I've had 10 years of humiliation!

46:41.289 --> 46:44.087
I won't mention the money
trouble I'm in...

46:44.289 --> 46:48.601
...from losing to Warden Sampson
and his gorillas, because of him!

46:48.809 --> 46:53.360
If that kid's for real, he'll ride
for Glenboro in the next rodeo...

46:53.569 --> 46:57.926
...and we're gonna whip Sampson's boys
and win that goddamn prize!

46:58.169 --> 47:04.358
Get that kid back here in an hour.
I wanna test him on Double Aught again.

47:04.569 --> 47:08.244
-Check it out.
-You check it out.

47:13.969 --> 47:18.247
My back hurts, fellas,
I'm gonna have to drop out.

47:20.289 --> 47:22.086
Okay.

47:23.529 --> 47:28.045
My back still hurts from yesterday.
Hurt it again.

47:28.249 --> 47:32.481
Harry, rub me a little bit,
right here, would you? That's it.

47:35.169 --> 47:39.321
That's better. Did you try that
thing in the warden's office?

47:39.529 --> 47:40.723
-It's fun.
-It is.

47:40.969 --> 47:44.757
Jesus was the champion
bull rider from his province.

47:44.969 --> 47:49.679
You're kidding! That's wonderful.
Are you gonna ride in the rodeo?

47:49.889 --> 47:53.962
-Jesus says the rodeo is bullshit.
-Why? How come?

47:54.169 --> 47:58.685
Do you know how much money
they make on it? $85,000 to $100,000.

47:58.889 --> 48:00.925
Hundred thousand dollars.

48:01.129 --> 48:04.599
We're supposed to get the money.
We don't get shit.

48:04.809 --> 48:07.881
We get our ass kicked. They get rich.

48:08.089 --> 48:11.525
The prisoners don't get one
penny of that money?

48:11.729 --> 48:14.880
No, I'm exaggerating a little,
I guess.

48:15.089 --> 48:19.401
Two years ago we got new
Ping-Pong balls. Five boxes.

48:19.649 --> 48:24.086
I don't understand one thing.
Why do the guys go to the rodeo?

48:24.329 --> 48:28.527
They scare everybody by threatening
to deny their parole.

48:28.769 --> 48:32.205
-That's how they get the kiss-asses.
-Outrageous!

48:32.449 --> 48:38.684
In Texas, they run an honest rodeo.
The prisoners keep the prize money.

48:38.929 --> 48:43.684
Them wardens over there are pretty
decent. Not like these pricks.

48:43.889 --> 48:46.278
Isn't that fucking outrageous?

48:46.649 --> 48:50.927
Say, I hear you went to six
on Double Aught, hey?

48:51.169 --> 48:56.163
-He's my man.
-Did you tell him? It wasn't so tough.

48:56.369 --> 48:59.679
Well, if you really did a six...

48:59.929 --> 49:04.525
...they're gonna want you to ride
in that Top Hand competition.

49:04.769 --> 49:06.999
Don't worry. I'm no brown-noser.

49:07.209 --> 49:11.282
Everybody knows that.
Why don't you hear the man out?

49:11.529 --> 49:17.525
If you ride in the Top Hand event,
there's a good chance we can bust out.

49:17.769 --> 49:20.237
You know what I mean?

49:31.369 --> 49:36.124
-Is he talking about a jailbreak--?
-You bet your ass.

49:37.129 --> 49:42.522
-What about our appeal?
-Appeal? Rory, tell him about appeals.

49:42.769 --> 49:48.127
The day I met you and Sweetpants was
my fifth appeal hearing in six years.

49:48.369 --> 49:49.722
Turned me down.

49:49.969 --> 49:54.008
Do you want to spend 30 years in here?
I couldn't take it.

49:54.249 --> 49:57.878
And I know you can't.
We gotta get out of here.

50:01.529 --> 50:07.923
Hello, operator, get me Warden Sampson
at Doerin Prison, please. Thank you.

50:08.289 --> 50:12.328
Hello, Wally.
How's your team look this year?

50:12.569 --> 50:16.084
Not too bad. We might
give you a race this year.

50:16.329 --> 50:18.797
Is that right?

50:19.009 --> 50:20.920
You got some new blood?

50:21.769 --> 50:23.521
Something like that.

50:23.769 --> 50:27.045
Seeing as how you're in
such good shape...

50:27.249 --> 50:29.968
...you want to put some real
money down?

50:31.129 --> 50:33.927
Well, I realize that $50,000...

50:34.129 --> 50:39.522
...ain't much these days, but it might
stimulate a little interest.

50:42.169 --> 50:47.960
Henry, one way or another,
I'm gonna cover that bet.

50:48.689 --> 50:51.078
What do you want me to do?

51:06.169 --> 51:11.004
You've got to convince the warden
that you won't ride, no matter what.

51:11.209 --> 51:16.522
He'll be so mad, he'll wet his pants,
because he makes this very big bet.

51:16.769 --> 51:21.718
But you gotta hold out, no matter
what they do. Don't give up.

51:21.929 --> 51:25.717
The longer you hold out,
the better chance for a bargain.

51:25.969 --> 51:27.084
What bargain?

51:27.289 --> 51:29.519
-You pick your crew.
-That's us.

51:29.729 --> 51:34.484
-The county stadium is tough to crack.
-Even tougher than this joint.

51:34.689 --> 51:40.161
-It's supposed to be escape-proof.
-But there's a weakness.

51:42.569 --> 51:47.085
This is fantastic.
Harry, there's a great novel in this.

51:47.289 --> 51:51.521
Which you won't start writing
till we get out of here, right?

51:52.969 --> 51:55.324
I guess I can wait seven months.

51:55.569 --> 51:57.400
Donahue!

51:59.769 --> 52:04.559
-Hello, warden. Nice to see you again.
-I've got some good news for you.

52:04.769 --> 52:09.285
-My wine magazines came?
-No, it's better than that.

52:09.489 --> 52:14.643
You're gonna represent Glenboro Prison
in the annual Top Hand competition.

52:14.849 --> 52:18.000
Congratulations.

52:18.249 --> 52:21.719
Oh, my God! Warden!

52:23.209 --> 52:26.838
-I can't do that.
-What the hell are you talking about?

52:27.049 --> 52:30.405
I should've told you.
My mom was a veterinarian.

52:30.609 --> 52:34.079
I can't exploit animals,
she'd roll over in her grave.

52:34.289 --> 52:37.918
You didn't hear me.
This is very important to me.

52:38.329 --> 52:43.483
Important to you? My mother
is watching over every step I make.

52:43.689 --> 52:48.205
Do you know my soul is on the line?
Please, let's drop-- What?

52:48.409 --> 52:52.880
I said no. I told him no.

52:53.129 --> 52:57.884
Ma, are you crazy? I have witnesses.
We'll talk about it in my cell.

53:00.529 --> 53:06.604
I have to go to the bathroom.
Would you excuse me, warden?

53:09.529 --> 53:12.919
That boy is very confused.
Straighten him out!

53:13.169 --> 53:17.321
Well, what about Jack Graham?
His knees have mended.

53:27.329 --> 53:28.887
Wake him up.

53:30.289 --> 53:34.965
-All right. On your feet. Let's move!
-What happened?

53:35.169 --> 53:39.481
Let's go, Mayor Koch.
And you too, Count Basie!

53:39.689 --> 53:41.168
-What time is it?
-4:30.

53:41.369 --> 53:42.404
Why so early?

53:42.609 --> 53:46.682
It's called paying your debt
to society. Now, let's move!

53:46.889 --> 53:52.088
-Is breakfast ready?
-Somebody stole the toilet!

53:52.289 --> 53:54.723
Over here.

53:59.049 --> 54:02.246
You're peeing on me.

55:45.889 --> 55:49.802
-Close 1 2.
-Close 1 2.

56:00.969 --> 56:06.726
Oh, shit! They're trying to kill me.
Please, God, please.

56:09.369 --> 56:12.725
They're coming back.
They're coming back.

56:44.809 --> 56:46.447
Pillow.

56:49.169 --> 56:51.000
I want my pillow.

57:05.169 --> 57:09.526
All right, you two. Up and at 'em!

57:22.849 --> 57:26.558
I can't feel nothing in my leg!

57:32.649 --> 57:35.209
-Don't you see the white line?
-Yes.

57:35.409 --> 57:40.927
-You're not to be to the side of it.
-Sorry, mistake. Won't happen again.

57:41.169 --> 57:43.922
Too late for that.
Get him out of here.

57:44.169 --> 57:45.238
Come on.

57:52.129 --> 57:55.166
-Close 10!
-Close 10!

58:28.249 --> 58:34.119
Hey! My back!
My 1 1 -year-old back problem is gone.

58:34.369 --> 58:40.365
I feel terrific. Thanks, cap. Wow!
What a lucky guy!

58:42.169 --> 58:43.602
You son of a guns!

58:44.489 --> 58:49.882
All right, get in there. I'll see you
in about five days, if you make it.

59:03.169 --> 59:04.602
Donahue?

59:09.889 --> 59:11.880
One more day, please.

59:12.089 --> 59:17.561
Just one more day. I was beginning
to get into myself. Be a pal.

59:20.089 --> 59:24.844
Harry, guess who's here?
How's my best--?

59:36.809 --> 59:40.961
Help me. Please help me!

59:41.209 --> 59:47.478
I left my wallet in the solitary.
Could l? Oh, please.

59:50.769 --> 59:55.365
Nighty-night, boys.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

01:00:08.929 --> 01:00:14.083
Grossberger.... Grossberger....

01:00:14.329 --> 01:00:20.325
-Come here. I want to talk to you.
-I can't go to you. It's amazing.

01:00:20.569 --> 01:00:21.558
Excuse me.

01:00:21.769 --> 01:00:26.889
-Don't touch him. Don't touch him.
-Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

01:00:27.089 --> 01:00:29.080
Please don't touch him.

01:00:29.289 --> 01:00:31.245
-See you later.
-Don't touch.

01:00:31.449 --> 01:00:32.802
I'll stand here.

01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:36.598
-Don't leave me, please.
-No. I'll just be over here.

01:00:45.169 --> 01:00:49.321
You think Grossberger ate them
up or did he leave some bones?

01:00:49.569 --> 01:00:53.642
If he did, we're gonna ship them
back to Times Square.

01:01:01.569 --> 01:01:06.040
-Say what? No, this is a jack.
-I know this is illegal.

01:01:06.249 --> 01:01:11.164
-We tried charades. He doesn't get it.
-This is dead. You can't play it.

01:01:11.369 --> 01:01:14.361
What is this? Look, what?
Cheating, look!

01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:15.604
-Wait.
-What?

01:01:15.809 --> 01:01:17.401
-Wait a second.
-What?

01:01:17.649 --> 01:01:21.528
-What? What do you call--?
-That's for this one.

01:01:24.489 --> 01:01:29.483
Well, how have you been getting along?

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:35.281
Excuse me. This is my cousin, Meredith.
She's been helping out on your case.

01:01:35.529 --> 01:01:40.284
-Hi.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:43.048
You too.

01:01:45.329 --> 01:01:49.720
It's amazing. There's hardly any
family resemblance. No offence.

01:01:52.129 --> 01:01:57.840
We're just barely cousins. See,
my mother was a French cancan dancer.

01:01:58.569 --> 01:02:03.689
And.... It's a long story.

01:02:03.889 --> 01:02:07.165
Say, how've you been getting along?

01:02:08.129 --> 01:02:13.522
Swell. Just swell.
A few ups and downs.

01:02:13.769 --> 01:02:17.728
You know, people see movies
about prison life...

01:02:17.969 --> 01:02:20.927
...but until you've actually
spent time here...

01:02:21.169 --> 01:02:26.289
...it's hard to get the real
flavour of what it's like.

01:02:26.529 --> 01:02:30.568
More Americans should spend
time behind bars to understand.

01:02:30.769 --> 01:02:33.203
More Americans probably will.

01:02:33.449 --> 01:02:38.682
Now, we have made your preliminary
bid for retrial and....

01:02:38.889 --> 01:02:42.484
Well, Meredith,
why don't you tell him?

01:02:42.689 --> 01:02:46.762
Remember the little girl in the bank?
She's ready to swear...

01:02:46.969 --> 01:02:51.008
...you weren't in the woodpecker
suits during the robbery.

01:02:51.209 --> 01:02:55.885
She remembers that one
of the robbers had a tattoo.

01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:58.523
-Do either of you have a tattoo?
-No.

01:02:58.729 --> 01:03:01.243
Good. I'll check the tattoo places.

01:03:01.449 --> 01:03:05.328
There's a raunchy strip joint
where tattooed guys hang out.

01:03:05.529 --> 01:03:09.078
I'm gonna try for
a part-time job there.

01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:12.679
Now, because the little girl
is only 6...

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:17.758
...the court said that her information
doesn't justify a new hearing.

01:03:17.969 --> 01:03:19.925
We're trying to change that.

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:22.768
On the basis that
information was withheld.

01:03:22.969 --> 01:03:25.927
All legal bullshit.
You were railroaded!

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:29.161
Another example
of a repressive system...

01:03:29.409 --> 01:03:31.969
...coming down
on the bottom of society.

01:03:32.169 --> 01:03:37.289
I don't know about the bottom part,
but I agree with you on the rest.

01:03:37.489 --> 01:03:43.439
You want to know something
that's always fascinated me...

01:03:43.649 --> 01:03:47.483
...are the prison romances
that sometimes spring up...

01:03:47.689 --> 01:03:54.083
...between inmates and girls from the
outside. Sometimes beautiful girls.

01:03:54.649 --> 01:03:56.799
I mean, would you, for example...

01:03:57.009 --> 01:04:03.005
...could you actually become involved,
I mean romantically, with a prisoner?

01:04:05.969 --> 01:04:08.005
Absolutely not.

01:04:11.929 --> 01:04:15.205
No, I didn't think so.

01:04:17.529 --> 01:04:21.078
I was just curious.

01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:25.680
-How's he tougher than you thought?
-In a few days I'll break him.

01:04:25.889 --> 01:04:30.599
We don't have a few days. Stock's
delivered. The contracts are out.

01:04:30.849 --> 01:04:32.805
And Doerin is ahead of us.

01:04:33.009 --> 01:04:36.046
I thought the kid
would be a little softer.

01:04:36.249 --> 01:04:40.288
He's soft. You just don't know
where to kick him.

01:04:40.489 --> 01:04:44.880
What are you talking about, my
appendix? I know about appendix!

01:04:45.089 --> 01:04:51.483
I had my appendix taken out already.
I had my appendix taken out. Help!

01:04:52.929 --> 01:04:56.808
Sir, help me! Please! Help!

01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:06.803
-What you in for?
-There's gotta be some confusion.

01:05:07.009 --> 01:05:11.161
They say my appendix grew back,
but I had it removed years ago. You?

01:05:11.369 --> 01:05:16.159
I came for a hernia operation. They
cut off one of my nuts by mistake.

01:05:16.369 --> 01:05:18.360
Say what?

01:05:18.569 --> 01:05:20.480
They said I didn't need it.

01:05:20.689 --> 01:05:26.366
Now I can't eat, I don't sleep, I got
no enthusiasm. I don't write my woman.

01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:29.606
I'm getting out next year,
but I don't care.

01:05:29.809 --> 01:05:31.686
You're sure taking it calm.

01:05:31.889 --> 01:05:33.561
Nothing I can do now.

01:05:33.769 --> 01:05:39.082
They got this Korean doctor just came
to this country. Don't get him.

01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:41.325
-Right.
-He did this to me.

01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:45.960
Korean, right. Jesus Christ!
What's the matter with him?

01:05:46.169 --> 01:05:52.005
Johnson's on a hunger strike. They're
force-feeding him to keep him alive.

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:55.639
Thank God.
There's some humanity in this place.

01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:58.647
They're gonna electrocute
him next month.

01:05:58.849 --> 01:06:01.682
Mr. Frazier? How do you go?

01:06:03.929 --> 01:06:06.648
That's the cat that did me.

01:06:06.889 --> 01:06:09.119
Be sure you cover up them jewels!

01:06:16.969 --> 01:06:21.724
-Hello, Donahue. What can I do for you?
-I'm ready to make a deal.

01:06:22.409 --> 01:06:28.723
-Oh? What kind of deal?
-I want my own team.

01:06:29.849 --> 01:06:33.683
And I want a bigger cell
with better ventilation.

01:06:33.929 --> 01:06:39.242
-Has Grossberger been farting on you?
-Settle down, Wilson.

01:06:40.489 --> 01:06:43.128
-I don't make deals, Donahue.
-I know.

01:06:43.369 --> 01:06:46.520
-But I think it might be arranged.
-Good.

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:51.524
I want to win that trophy. And I'm
counting on you to go balls-out.

01:06:51.769 --> 01:06:56.001
I only have one speed: balls-out.

01:06:56.249 --> 01:07:01.926
That's the spirit. You'll get
out of here a relatively young man.

01:07:02.169 --> 01:07:06.003
-I'm looking forward to that.
-I guess we have a deal.

01:07:06.209 --> 01:07:07.722
I guess so.

01:07:09.449 --> 01:07:11.758
Ride 'em, cowboy.

01:07:12.009 --> 01:07:13.761
Okay.

01:07:20.889 --> 01:07:25.087
-I want an inmate guard on them.
-Graham'll watch them.

01:07:25.289 --> 01:07:27.359
Put Blade on Graham.

01:07:28.849 --> 01:07:30.282
Right.

01:07:40.769 --> 01:07:42.646
Hey, sucker!

01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:49.958
The shit's gonna start now.

01:07:50.769 --> 01:07:54.967
Why are you joining the rodeo?
Sucking up to the warden?

01:07:55.169 --> 01:07:59.685
He's not sucking up. We're having fun.
We showed aptitude for it.

01:07:59.889 --> 01:08:01.880
Aptitude? You hear that?

01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:08.164
Lay off. The man's doing what he's got
to. They were gonna cut his nuts off.

01:08:08.369 --> 01:08:11.964
-I don't want to discuss my nuts.
-Work your tail off...

01:08:12.169 --> 01:08:13.397
Don't sweat it.

01:08:13.609 --> 01:08:17.363
...then get replaced by an amateur
who knows nothing.

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:21.038
He may be going into the rodeo,
but he may not come out.

01:08:28.769 --> 01:08:33.923
Oh, what a horse.
Jesus, what a beauty.

01:08:34.169 --> 01:08:38.765
What a sweet, beautiful face he has.
Look, he's listening to us.

01:08:39.009 --> 01:08:44.800
He's listening to every word we say,
I bet. Okay, sweetheart, here I come.

01:08:45.049 --> 01:08:48.519
-Don't be misled. He's a chute fighter.
-Hello.

01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:53.803
-He'll try to kill you in the chute.
-I don't think so. I'd love to try him.

01:08:54.009 --> 01:08:55.840
Aren't you rushing a bit?

01:08:56.049 --> 01:09:00.361
Did you see the look he gave?
He's a sweetheart, a pussycat.

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:05.279
-I've never ridden a real horse.
-Remember, no spurs in the belly.

01:09:05.488 --> 01:09:07.444
-Not in the belly.
-Spurs high.

01:09:07.649 --> 01:09:11.085
Okay. Well, this should be a snap.
Let her rip!

01:09:26.488 --> 01:09:29.242
Skip! Skip! Are you all right?

01:09:33.448 --> 01:09:37.283
I'm fine. I wanted to see
what it's like to get thrown.

01:09:37.488 --> 01:09:40.879
Grossberger, I'm fine.
You can put me down now.

01:09:41.089 --> 01:09:46.209
You get a little overprotective
sometimes. Okay, where's that sucker?

01:09:46.809 --> 01:09:50.279
Now, let me explain to you
about bulls, okay?

01:09:50.488 --> 01:09:56.883
A bull is the most evil, disgusting,
and crafty sucker in the world.

01:09:57.409 --> 01:10:03.598
He'll snot on you, fart on you, do
anything he can to mash out your brain.

01:10:03.809 --> 01:10:07.404
The worst kind of bull is the one
that won't do nothing.

01:10:07.609 --> 01:10:09.918
Just stand there. Look at you.

01:10:10.089 --> 01:10:12.045
That means he's studying you.

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:13.961
Learning your weak spots...

01:10:14.129 --> 01:10:18.122
...and remembering them for
the time he prances on your head.

01:10:18.289 --> 01:10:21.281
Blade, you got it wrong. I'm a clown.

01:10:21.449 --> 01:10:23.599
I shoot firecrackers off...

01:10:23.769 --> 01:10:26.408
...there's a little car
with midgets....

01:10:26.569 --> 01:10:29.083
-That ain't no rodeo clown.
-I know--

01:10:29.249 --> 01:10:33.083
A rodeo clown is the most
dangerous job in the world.

01:10:33.249 --> 01:10:36.002
He's the one that
gets closest to the bull.

01:10:36.169 --> 01:10:39.127
-He gets the best of the bull.
-I don't want--

01:10:39.449 --> 01:10:42.521
-Hook to the left, hook to the side--
-Blade--

01:10:42.769 --> 01:10:46.762
If the bull rider is in danger,
he's got to protect him.

01:10:46.929 --> 01:10:50.285
Even if it means
getting his ribs pulled out!

01:10:50.449 --> 01:10:52.883
-And being freight-trained.
-Freight-trained?

01:10:53.089 --> 01:10:58.561
Run over, just like a freight train.
Only with a bull, it's worse.

01:10:58.729 --> 01:11:02.608
A freight train don't back up
and finish the job.

01:11:02.769 --> 01:11:05.966
Later I'll show you how
to lie on a stretcher...

01:11:06.129 --> 01:11:08.518
-...when they come to pick you up.
-What?

01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:14.127
Right. Now, let's practice trying
to sucker the bull out of the chute.

01:11:14.289 --> 01:11:18.123
The warden wants you in one
piece till after the rodeo.

01:11:18.289 --> 01:11:22.919
-Then your ass belongs to me, got that?
-What about balloons and stuff?

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:27.408
Every bull has a secret word
that makes him crazy.

01:11:27.569 --> 01:11:30.083
Sends him into his wildest ride.

01:11:30.249 --> 01:11:32.922
Your job is to figure out that word.

01:11:39.449 --> 01:11:41.440
Blade....

01:11:45.609 --> 01:11:49.966
Bull.... Let me see....
Rumpelstiltskin?

01:11:52.649 --> 01:11:56.324
Uh.... Malt liquor.

01:11:56.649 --> 01:11:58.526
Come on. Come on, bull.

01:12:02.409 --> 01:12:05.003
Bull? Come on.

01:12:05.809 --> 01:12:07.720
Come on.

01:12:14.409 --> 01:12:17.560
Hey. Hey, sexy.

01:12:17.729 --> 01:12:19.720
Shit.

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:22.448
Oh, you motherfucker!

01:12:22.689 --> 01:12:25.761
Congratulations! You found the word!

01:13:44.369 --> 01:13:45.848
Over there.

01:13:56.969 --> 01:13:59.642
Teresa....

01:14:24.129 --> 01:14:26.848
-Hi.
-Hi. How are you?

01:14:27.009 --> 01:14:30.445
A little groggy from looking
at records of tattoos.

01:14:30.609 --> 01:14:34.045
Who got which, when and where.
So far, nothing.

01:14:34.209 --> 01:14:38.600
The court refuses to act
on the little girl's word.

01:14:38.809 --> 01:14:40.561
Doesn't look too good, huh?

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:46.037
-Can you think of anything else?
-Some small piece of evidence...

01:14:46.289 --> 01:14:48.120
-...anything.
-Anything.

01:14:48.289 --> 01:14:52.567
This may sound silly, but have you seen
A Place in the Sun?

01:14:54.609 --> 01:15:00.161
A Place in the Sun with
Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift?

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.160
Yeah.

01:15:02.409 --> 01:15:03.888
That's my favourite.

01:15:05.009 --> 01:15:10.481
Your favourite? That's your--?
That's my favourite too!

01:15:16.329 --> 01:15:18.843
What does that tell us?

01:15:19.089 --> 01:15:23.367
Maybe we're not such strangers
as circumstances would imply.

01:15:27.209 --> 01:15:28.688
Maybe we're not.

01:15:29.489 --> 01:15:35.519
You know, I'm working on a new play,
and I just wondered...

01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:39.398
...would you like to come
to the opening night with me?

01:15:40.489 --> 01:15:41.888
I'd love to.

01:15:42.809 --> 01:15:44.879
You....

01:15:46.569 --> 01:15:49.925
Maybe we ought to get you
out of here first, though.

01:15:50.089 --> 01:15:53.684
Okay. Shoot.

01:18:11.609 --> 01:18:15.807
Supposed to be doing time.
It's a goddamned vacation for them.

01:18:15.969 --> 01:18:19.166
How would you like an old-time
prison funeral?

01:18:19.329 --> 01:18:21.763
Could you go for that?

01:18:26.049 --> 01:18:32.761
Just relax. He's gonna draw Untamed
in the bronc event.

01:19:56.769 --> 01:20:00.444
A hundred and twenty-five years
without a whiff of pussy.

01:20:00.609 --> 01:20:06.445
-How'd that make you feel, Mason?
-Mean. Very, very mean.

01:20:13.889 --> 01:20:17.359
Hello? Mr. Len Garber, please.

01:20:17.529 --> 01:20:20.839
Did he leave word
where he could be reached?

01:20:21.009 --> 01:20:23.967
Okay. Thank you.

01:20:31.249 --> 01:20:36.243
Operator? Please get me the sheriff's
office. This is an emergency.

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:49.040
I've been looking for you.

01:20:49.289 --> 01:20:51.200
-Where've you been?
-Look at this.

01:20:51.369 --> 01:20:56.124
It's so simple it is absurd.
It should be laughed out of court.

01:20:56.289 --> 01:20:58.120
We'll talk about that later.

01:20:58.329 --> 01:21:01.287
-They're gonna kill your clients.
-They're innocent!

01:21:01.449 --> 01:21:04.361
That's not the point.
I'll explain it later.

01:21:04.569 --> 01:21:06.525
We have to get to the rodeo.

01:21:06.689 --> 01:21:08.839
It's across town.
We'll never make it.

01:21:09.009 --> 01:21:11.887
We have to try.
Will you shut up and hurry?

01:21:12.049 --> 01:21:15.485
I almost blew it.
How can I call myself a lawyer?

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:36.366
That's it for the preliminaries.

01:21:36.609 --> 01:21:39.601
Get ready for the event
that you all came to see.

01:21:39.769 --> 01:21:44.365
It's our featured event,
the Top Hand competition.

01:21:47.729 --> 01:21:51.608
-How's your secret weapon, Wally?
-Fit as a fiddle, Henry.

01:21:51.849 --> 01:21:55.000
-It's a nice day for it, ain't it?
-Sure is.

01:21:55.649 --> 01:22:01.360
-Come on down, got your Coke here....
-Peanuts, popcorn....

01:23:25.289 --> 01:23:29.077
Now remember, spur him high
on the shoulders, okay?

01:23:29.249 --> 01:23:30.967
Try to keep a good rhythm.

01:23:31.129 --> 01:23:34.804
It's time for the wild and woolly
Top Hand competition.

01:23:34.969 --> 01:23:39.087
Leading off for Glenboro Prison
is New Yorker Skip Donahue...

01:23:39.289 --> 01:23:44.158
... doing time for making a withdrawal
without having an account.

01:23:44.329 --> 01:23:49.119
He told the judge he was just trying
to help New York by using our money.

01:23:49.289 --> 01:23:53.328
-I hope I can remember everything.
-Good luck.

01:23:53.849 --> 01:23:57.046
Thanks. That's very kind of you.

01:24:17.489 --> 01:24:22.279
That's our boy, baby!
That's our boy there!

01:24:28.249 --> 01:24:33.642
What do you say about that, folks?
He's got some cowboy in him, huh?

01:24:33.809 --> 01:24:36.960
He sure does. You old sly bones.

01:24:37.129 --> 01:24:40.201
-Where'd you get him?
-We'll see.

01:24:41.089 --> 01:24:46.163
Next up, five-time winner and current
champion, Caesar Geronimo.

01:24:46.329 --> 01:24:49.844
Got caught selling
some white powder at the border.

01:24:50.009 --> 01:24:53.160
And by white powder,
I don't mean talcum powder.

01:24:53.329 --> 01:24:58.642
His horse is so tough it's already
put 1 1 cowboys in the hospital.

01:24:58.889 --> 01:25:02.120
And that's just by breaking wind
on them.

01:25:38.129 --> 01:25:43.283
All right! That cowboy must have
some real strong glue in the saddle.

01:25:54.409 --> 01:25:58.322
Ladies and gentlemen,
that man of mischief from Oklahoma...

01:25:58.529 --> 01:26:03.762
... Iast year's runner-up is getting set
in chute number five, Ringo Stapelton.

01:26:03.969 --> 01:26:08.281
He's doing 99 years for kidnapping
a trainload of college girls...

01:26:08.489 --> 01:26:12.084
... on their way to a singing
contest in Las Vegas.

01:26:19.209 --> 01:26:25.000
Oh, Ringo's in trouble already. He's
down, and the bull's on top of him!

01:26:34.449 --> 01:26:36.838
Next is Bucky Stillwater...

01:26:37.049 --> 01:26:43.045
... found guilty of misplacing
$4 million worth of insurance money.

01:26:43.249 --> 01:26:45.524
The money was never recovered...

01:26:45.729 --> 01:26:49.642
... which is why Bucky has more friends
among the inmates...

01:26:49.849 --> 01:26:52.966
... than any other prisoner
in the whole system.

01:26:53.169 --> 01:26:57.720
Whatever Bucky wants, old Bucky gets.
Except for parole, that is....

01:27:06.929 --> 01:27:12.481
Don't be too surprised if Bucky's out
in time to enjoy that loot...

01:27:12.689 --> 01:27:15.761
...before old age catches up
with him.

01:28:16.969 --> 01:28:21.918
Third up, out of chute number four,
is the Glenboro Prison entry.

01:28:22.089 --> 01:28:26.765
It's that city slicker again, who's
giving the champ a run for his money.

01:28:26.929 --> 01:28:29.887
Can he keep it up?
We're gonna all find out...

01:28:30.049 --> 01:28:34.167
... whether it's luck or if he's
really got some redneck in him.

01:28:34.329 --> 01:28:38.117
Up on Flapjack, here's Skip Donahue.

01:28:38.289 --> 01:28:41.042
Okay. A little tighter, Jesus.

01:28:41.249 --> 01:28:42.887
-How's that?
-That's it.

01:28:46.329 --> 01:28:47.921
Watch his head.

01:28:51.449 --> 01:28:54.919
-Ready?
-Okay, let's go.

01:28:57.089 --> 01:28:59.284
Open the gate!

01:28:59.569 --> 01:29:02.720
Seem to have ourselves
a problem down here.

01:29:04.169 --> 01:29:06.524
He'll be killed in there!

01:29:08.809 --> 01:29:11.926
Some son of a bitch
put a lock on the gate!

01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:31.438
That New Yorker is full of surprises.

01:30:31.649 --> 01:30:35.164
Now here's last year's champ,
Caesar Geronimo...

01:30:35.329 --> 01:30:39.527
...riding a bull that nobody
can ride for more than 3 seconds.

01:30:39.729 --> 01:30:42.323
A bull by the name of Tornado.

01:31:20.929 --> 01:31:23.807
Now you know why he's
our defending champ.

01:31:24.009 --> 01:31:28.958
Well, folks, take a breather while
the judges tally up the scores.

01:31:29.169 --> 01:31:30.921
We'll pause for the cause...

01:31:31.129 --> 01:31:35.168
...and I'll be back in just a bit
to announce the winner.

01:31:44.289 --> 01:31:47.520
Hold on, folks, we got
ourselves the first...

01:31:47.729 --> 01:31:50.721
...push in the history of the prison
rodeo.

01:31:50.889 --> 01:31:55.087
There ain't gonna be any push.
I was ready for this.

01:32:06.449 --> 01:32:09.168
Ladies and gentlemen,
hold on to your hats.

01:32:09.329 --> 01:32:14.767
As a tiebreaker, both wardens
have okayed the Hard Money event...

01:32:14.929 --> 01:32:18.638
... the single most dangerous
event in all of rodeo competition.

01:32:18.809 --> 01:32:21.323
All you have to do to win this event...

01:32:21.489 --> 01:32:26.517
... is snatch a little sack of money
between the horns of a bull.

01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:32.924
As soon as our two boys get ready,
we'll start our final competition.

01:32:48.809 --> 01:32:52.563
Are you ready for the main event?

01:32:53.169 --> 01:32:57.321
Well, listen to this. Warden Beatty
has just informed me...

01:32:57.489 --> 01:33:01.801
... that he and Warden Sampson
have so much faith in their boys...

01:33:02.009 --> 01:33:05.558
... that instead of splitting the purse
as usual...

01:33:05.769 --> 01:33:08.488
... it'll be a winner-take-all event.

01:33:08.689 --> 01:33:12.523
I'm saying that $50, 000 in bills
is gonna be tied...

01:33:12.689 --> 01:33:16.568
...between the horns of one of the
meanest bulls around.

01:33:16.769 --> 01:33:20.398
And whichever inmate grabs the money
is the winner.

01:33:20.569 --> 01:33:22.844
And here they are,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:33:23.009 --> 01:33:25.443
I get nervous sometimes before
these things.

01:33:25.609 --> 01:33:31.047
-Word is that your warden's a nice guy.
-He's a prick.

01:33:31.209 --> 01:33:37.523
A prick? Boy, did I hear that wrong.
Well, is it true you're an ass-kisser?

01:33:37.689 --> 01:33:42.399
-You're gonna get a punch in the mouth.
-I'm just telling you what I heard.

01:33:42.569 --> 01:33:44.161
I'm an ass-kisser too.

01:33:44.329 --> 01:33:48.720
We're both dumb if no one's gonna
get this money except two pricks.

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:50.880
Stands to reason, doesn't it?

01:34:21.169 --> 01:34:24.764
I'll distract the bull,
you grab the money. Okay?

01:34:24.929 --> 01:34:27.238
What difference
does it make who wins?

01:34:27.409 --> 01:34:30.003
Why don't we give the cash
to the prisoners?

01:34:30.169 --> 01:34:36.517
I'll tell you what. You do whatever you
think is best, okay? Get ready.

01:36:52.569 --> 01:36:57.597
The winner, and champion for the
sixth time in a row, Caesar Geronimo.

01:36:57.849 --> 01:37:00.522
Goddamn!

01:37:35.089 --> 01:37:38.798
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle!
That boy's lost his mind.

01:37:38.969 --> 01:37:43.406
Holy cow, there's gonna
be hell to pay for that.

01:37:49.689 --> 01:37:55.605
Now to wrap up our day, here's
the greased-pig sacking contest.

01:39:58.889 --> 01:40:00.083
-Holy shit!
-What?

01:40:04.769 --> 01:40:07.681
What the hell is going--?
Are you okay?

01:40:08.089 --> 01:40:09.522
They're in the camper!

01:40:13.329 --> 01:40:16.958
Look, I'm sorry, but we're
in a real hurry, okay?

01:40:17.169 --> 01:40:19.046
What is going on?

01:40:43.849 --> 01:40:46.568
I'm sorry.
Harry Monroe, Skip Donahue...

01:40:46.729 --> 01:40:49.038
...Rory Schultebrand.

01:40:49.209 --> 01:40:53.725
-My wife, Teresa, and my brother, Ramon.
-Hello.

01:40:53.889 --> 01:40:56.961
-Hey, guys. That is yours.
-Where you guys going?

01:40:57.129 --> 01:40:59.484
Veracruz. We got some family there.

01:40:59.649 --> 01:41:04.006
-Hey, Rory going with you?
-Try to be brave, Sweetpants.

01:41:04.169 --> 01:41:07.764
-Oh, man! Take care.
-Be a good girl, now.

01:41:07.929 --> 01:41:12.127
Ramon! A su casa, honey.
It's me and you!

01:41:18.649 --> 01:41:21.482
He kissed me. Damn!

01:41:31.769 --> 01:41:33.487
Let's go.

01:41:40.809 --> 01:41:43.607
We got to get the hell out of here!

01:42:00.129 --> 01:42:01.960
Wait a minute.

01:42:06.729 --> 01:42:08.685
-How'd you get out?
-We busted out.

01:42:08.849 --> 01:42:10.999
-But you're free!
-You're damn right!

01:42:11.169 --> 01:42:15.959
-No, they caught the other two guys.
-Thanks to Meredith.

01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:17.482
Oh!

01:42:19.489 --> 01:42:24.517
You mean, we're really free?
We're free!

01:42:30.049 --> 01:42:33.405
-You're a hell of a lawyer.
-Thanks. Thanks very much.

01:42:33.569 --> 01:42:36.800
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

01:42:40.969 --> 01:42:44.245
-Thanks for everything.
-It's okay.

01:42:49.929 --> 01:42:51.806
Thank you.

01:42:51.969 --> 01:42:53.607
It's okay.

01:43:03.809 --> 01:43:08.837
Come on. Let's get out of this state
before somebody changes their mind.

01:43:21.449 --> 01:43:25.078
-Aren't you forgetting something?
-What?

01:43:25.329 --> 01:43:28.162
What about my opening night?

01:43:28.329 --> 01:43:30.604
Am I still invited?

01:43:31.609 --> 01:43:35.124
Holy mackerel! How many times
do I have to ask you?

01:43:45.289 --> 01:43:46.608
Come on.

01:46:26.689 --> 01:46:27.678
