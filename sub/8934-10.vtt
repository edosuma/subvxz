WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.467
This is the

00:00.467 --> 00:00.767
This is
the Evergreen Forest,

00:03.870 --> 00:06.139
quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.110
That is until Bert
Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.210 --> 00:11.044
Yahoo!

00:14.014 --> 00:14.848
Yee hoo!

00:16.916 --> 00:18.184
Yikes!

00:24.257 --> 00:25.692
Luckily he
has some good friends

00:25.792 --> 00:26.960
to help him out.

00:34.167 --> 00:39.172
Life would be simple in the
forest, except for Cyril Sneer.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.845
And his life would be simple,
except for the Raccoons.

01:02.829 --> 01:05.765
When you see the Evergreen
Forest peaceful and calm

01:05.865 --> 01:07.233
it seems hard to believe

01:07.333 --> 01:11.638
that dinosaurs roamed here
100 million years ago.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.273
Hard to believe that is,

01:13.373 --> 01:16.543
unless you have an
imagination, like Bert Raccoon.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.213
It's right where
we want him, Broo.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.585
This looks like a
pretty hairy situation

01:25.685 --> 01:28.088
here at the beginning of time,

01:28.188 --> 01:32.192
for Bert Raccoon,
dinosaur hunter.

01:34.828 --> 01:35.628
Hit the deck, Broo.

01:38.364 --> 01:41.167
Ah, they
don't make dinosaurs

01:41.267 --> 01:44.671
like they used to, eh, Broo.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.640
It must have been
something in the old days,

01:47.740 --> 01:52.479
a hundred million years ago
when monsters ruled the Earth.

01:54.814 --> 01:56.349
Now they're just fossils.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.818
And we better get busy
and find some of them

01:58.918 --> 02:01.020
or I'll never be able to put
a decent collection together

02:01.121 --> 02:02.388
for the science fair.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.525
You know you'd think
there would be one

02:05.625 --> 02:08.061
crummy fossil around here.

02:09.095 --> 02:10.063
What'd you say old buddy?

02:11.297 --> 02:13.733
Way to go, Broo! A trilobite.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.570
On this is great, Broo.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.073
A few more like these
and I'll.

02:32.418 --> 02:34.420
Oh no, I lost my fossil.

02:35.588 --> 02:37.390
Hey, wait a minute.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.159
This is tar.

02:39.259 --> 02:41.094
We found a tar pit.

02:41.194 --> 02:42.762
You know what this means, Broo?

02:44.397 --> 02:45.965
It means we don't need to worry

02:46.065 --> 02:49.002
about one lousy
fossil, 'cause in here

02:49.102 --> 02:52.872
we're gonna find
a whole dinosaur.

02:52.972 --> 02:56.843
Yahoo!

02:56.943 --> 02:58.378
Honestly, Bert.

02:58.478 --> 03:00.346
You're the only person I
know who could go looking

03:00.446 --> 03:03.650
for fossils and
fall into a tar pit.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.885
Yeah, I always
have admired the way

03:05.985 --> 03:07.487
you stick to things, Bert.

03:07.587 --> 03:10.456
Oh, very funny, Ralph.

03:10.557 --> 03:12.358
But you won't think
it's such a big joke

03:12.458 --> 03:14.727
when I, Bert Raccoon,

03:14.827 --> 03:18.698
dig up the dinosaur
find of the century.

03:18.798 --> 03:22.268
Do you really think you'll
find something in that pit?

03:22.368 --> 03:23.536
You bet I do.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.205
It's all in that book.

03:25.305 --> 03:27.340
Just read the
section on tar pits.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.343
I tell you that book
was so interesting.

03:30.443 --> 03:32.412
I couldn't put it down.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.548
Yeah, neither can I.

03:35.648 --> 03:37.650
You see these tar
pits have been around

03:37.750 --> 03:39.118
for millions of years,

03:39.219 --> 03:41.421
trapping anything
that falls into them,

03:41.521 --> 03:45.491
like er, dinosaurs and
saber-tooth tigers.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.360
And Bert Raccoons.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.429
Yoohoo! Guess who?

03:50.430 --> 03:51.631
Hi, Lady Baden-Baden.

03:51.731 --> 03:52.865
Morning, Professor.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.601
Don't say anything
about the tar pit.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.736
I want it to be a surprise.

03:56.836 --> 03:58.871
Oh, hi, Lady Baden-Baden.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.506
Professor Smedley-Smythe.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.642
Oh, good morning. Yes.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.111
I just dropped by to
make sure you'll be

04:05.211 --> 04:09.382
at the judging for the
science fair tomorrow.

04:09.482 --> 04:13.386
Oh yes. It will
be a very big story.

04:13.486 --> 04:16.155
I am one of the judges you know.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.259
This brochure will tell
you all you need to know

04:19.359 --> 04:21.160
about the science fair.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.964
Oh, how's your science project
coming along, young fellow?

04:25.064 --> 04:26.232
Oh.

04:26.332 --> 04:29.035
I can't wait to show
it to you, Professor.

04:29.135 --> 04:31.204
It's gonna be dynamite.

04:31.304 --> 04:32.705
Oh dear.

04:32.805 --> 04:37.010
I don't believe we can allow
explosives in the museum.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.445
Well, ta-ta till
tomorrow then.

04:39.545 --> 04:43.416
Come along, Professor, we
have a million things to do.

04:43.516 --> 04:44.751
A million things.

04:46.085 --> 04:47.153
The competition's
going to be tough

04:47.253 --> 04:49.555
at the Evergreen Museum
Science Fair, son.

04:49.656 --> 04:53.693
What you want is something
with more glitz or pizazz.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.262
Chrome, custom sparkle paint.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.998
This thing looks like you
made it out of spare parts.

04:59.098 --> 05:01.801
I did, Pop. That's
the whole idea.

05:01.901 --> 05:03.469
Anyway, it ought to work.

05:03.569 --> 05:06.239
Ought to work,
it's got to work.

05:06.339 --> 05:07.874
It's got to win.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.611
We Sneers don't take
second place too well.

05:11.711 --> 05:14.914
I don't think it's
quite ready to fly, Pop.

05:15.014 --> 05:16.749
I'll be the judge of that.

05:16.849 --> 05:18.885
Contact. Gangway.

05:22.422 --> 05:23.256
Fly!

05:24.524 --> 05:26.225
Fly you rotten heap!

05:26.326 --> 05:27.060
Pop!

05:27.160 --> 05:27.894
- Aargh!
- Whoa!

05:29.429 --> 05:30.863
Uh oh!

05:37.837 --> 05:40.340
This thing's got all
the flight characteristics

05:40.440 --> 05:42.408
of a construction brick, son.

05:42.508 --> 05:46.012
But don't worry, we'll build
the best darn flying machine

05:46.112 --> 05:48.047
the judges ever saw.

05:48.147 --> 05:52.518
Um, I guess a little help
might be all right, Pop.

05:52.618 --> 05:55.621
But the rules say I've
gotta build it myself.

05:55.722 --> 05:57.323
And you will, son.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.192
I'm just here to help out.

05:59.292 --> 06:02.695
That's what fathers
are for. Right, son?

06:02.795 --> 06:04.397
Er, right, Pop.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.099
I thought you might be
able to use this stuff

06:06.199 --> 06:07.200
for your project.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.468
Thanks, Bert.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.903
Say, how's your project coming?

06:11.003 --> 06:14.307
Oh ho, just wait till
you see it, Cedric.

06:14.407 --> 06:18.277
I am this close to the
most amazing discovery

06:18.378 --> 06:20.580
in the history of science.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.749
Gee. That sounds great, Bert.

06:22.849 --> 06:23.716
Good luck with it.

06:23.816 --> 06:25.385
Ah, thanks buddy.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.453
And good luck to you too.

06:27.553 --> 06:31.791
The most amazing discovery
in the history of science?

06:31.891 --> 06:35.695
You know, he just might
win first prize with that.

06:38.831 --> 06:42.869
Bert Raccoon, high
tech dinosaur hunter.

06:43.803 --> 06:46.672
No tyrannosaurus too large.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.909
No stegosaurus too vicious.

06:50.009 --> 06:53.513
No thesaurus too thick.

06:53.613 --> 06:54.347
How's this?

06:54.447 --> 06:56.048
Inspiring, Bert.

06:56.983 --> 06:58.050
Nice pose, Bert.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.318
Thanks, Melissa.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.854
That picture will go
great with my story.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.590
Dinosaur treasure trove found.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.027
Er, as soon as I find it.

07:10.129 --> 07:11.831
I think you just did.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.766
I knew it. I knew it!

07:13.866 --> 07:16.068
Ha ha! There is
something down there.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.705
So, what do you think, son?

07:19.806 --> 07:22.175
It looks pretty
sharp, Pop, but-

07:22.275 --> 07:24.143
I know. I know.

07:24.243 --> 07:27.013
You don't think you can
build it alone, right?

07:27.113 --> 07:28.915
That's why I'm here, son.

07:29.015 --> 07:31.184
Now you were on the right track.

07:31.284 --> 07:35.154
But just for starters, your
gear ratio's way too low.

07:35.254 --> 07:37.557
Yeah, I figured that
Pop and I was going to-

07:38.958 --> 07:41.527
No sense fooling around
with these old bicycle parts.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.996
If you're going to do
something, do it right.

07:45.498 --> 07:47.767
Ha ha! Right on time.

07:47.867 --> 07:50.236
I ordered this
just for you, son.

07:50.336 --> 07:51.971
Everything you need
for your plane.

07:52.071 --> 07:54.707
Ultralight plastic,
magnesium frame

07:54.807 --> 07:57.176
and aluminum magnesium
alloy wheels.

07:57.276 --> 08:00.613
Ha ha. I even got
the sparkly paint.

08:00.713 --> 08:02.181
Great, hey?

08:02.281 --> 08:04.116
Uh, yeah, Pop. Great.

08:05.985 --> 08:09.355
Do you think we'll ever
move up in this business?

08:09.455 --> 08:10.890
I know we will.

08:10.990 --> 08:15.228
When we're done this, the boss
wants us to shingle the roof.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.062
Ooh!

08:16.162 --> 08:17.530
Oh boy, the comics.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.766
Remind me not to
tip the paper boy.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.702
"Bert's big discovery.

08:22.802 --> 08:24.770
Bert Raccoon on the
verge of unearthing

08:24.871 --> 08:28.140
a treasure trove
of dinosaur bones."

08:28.241 --> 08:30.676
Oh there's no way
Master Cedric can win.

08:31.777 --> 08:34.714
Unless we do
something about it.

08:34.814 --> 08:37.250
Dinosaur bones, huh?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.886
Now we can't leave
that poor raccoon

08:39.986 --> 08:42.154
on the verge of
finding them, can we?

08:43.756 --> 08:44.590
Uh, no.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.699
Dang blasted wrench.

08:53.799 --> 08:56.068
They don't make them
like they used to!

08:57.036 --> 08:58.237
Aargh!

08:58.337 --> 09:01.440
Er, Pop. Maybe we
should take a break?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.576
A break? Forget it.

09:03.676 --> 09:06.145
I didn't get where I
am by taking breaks.

09:06.245 --> 09:07.980
Now let's get back to work.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.448
All right, Pop.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.785
That's the trouble with
kids these days, no endurance.

09:12.885 --> 09:16.188
Why when I was your age,
I was three years older.

09:16.289 --> 09:20.693
I'd work night and day to
get my science projects done.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.028
Sure, Pop.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.430
And my father wasn't
around to help me.

09:24.530 --> 09:28.134
Oh no. I had to
do it all myself.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.035
Gee.

09:29.135 --> 09:31.637
No, no, no, no.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.706
You're doing it all wrong.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.608
Put you're back into it, son.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.577
Like this.

09:37.677 --> 09:38.844
And they don't make

09:38.945 --> 09:41.147
socket wrenches like
they used to either.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.316
Why, when I was a boy-

09:49.522 --> 09:50.356
Shh!

09:58.564 --> 09:59.632
Shh!

10:03.736 --> 10:05.404
If Snag wakes
up, we're doomed.

10:05.504 --> 10:08.441
I'm not sure this is
such a great idea.

10:08.541 --> 10:12.511
Trust me and keep it quiet.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.080
I'm getting the heebie jeebies

11:54.180 --> 11:57.183
just thinking about
Snag waking up.

12:02.655 --> 12:03.656
Run!

12:03.756 --> 12:05.124
Run for your lives.

12:10.963 --> 12:13.199
So what is it you
want me to see, Bert?

12:13.299 --> 12:16.202
If I told you it
wouldn't be a surprise,

12:16.302 --> 12:19.538
but believe me,
Cedric, it's great.

12:19.638 --> 12:22.174
You won't regret taking
the time to have a look.

12:22.274 --> 12:25.311
So er, how's your
project coming along?

12:25.411 --> 12:28.981
I don't think it's my
project anymore, Bert.

12:30.182 --> 12:31.984
I think we lost him.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.753
Boy, I've seen
Snag mad before,

12:34.754 --> 12:36.589
but this time he's mad mad.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.493
Well, let's not stand
around waiting for him.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.396
But shouldn't we put the
skeleton together first.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.833
Nah, let that
raccoon figure it out.

12:47.933 --> 12:48.768
Okay.

12:50.402 --> 12:51.704
Bottoms up.

12:51.804 --> 12:54.807
Boy, I'd love to see his face

12:54.907 --> 12:59.245
when the judges tell him he's
got a pile of doggy bones.

13:05.217 --> 13:06.519
He's found us!

13:10.222 --> 13:12.591
Ta da! This is it, Cedric.

13:12.691 --> 13:15.161
My science project.

13:15.261 --> 13:19.899
The Evergreen Forest's
first dinosaur dig.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.367
Wow!

13:21.467 --> 13:24.770
And you figure there's
dinosaur bones down there.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.205
You betcha, Cedric.

13:26.305 --> 13:29.942
This is not your average
hole in the ground.

13:30.843 --> 13:31.811
Hey!

13:32.812 --> 13:35.047
Cedric, a bone.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.148
I found a dinosaur bone.

13:36.248 --> 13:37.650
I found a whole bunch.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.452
Cedric, I found a dinosaur!

13:42.755 --> 13:45.457
Marley, barley, buck and rye.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.027
That's the way we aardvarks fly.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.796
Some fly east and some fly west

13:50.896 --> 13:53.966
and some fly over the
cuckoos nest. Ha ha.

13:54.066 --> 13:54.800
Hi, Pop.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.302
Don't, "Hi Pop" me.

13:56.402 --> 13:58.037
Where have you
been all afternoon?

13:58.137 --> 14:00.272
Well, I went to
mail some letters

14:00.372 --> 14:02.808
and I ran into Bert and
he wanted me to see-

14:02.908 --> 14:05.444
I don't want to hear about
that fur-bearing freak.

14:05.544 --> 14:08.047
Is he more important
than your own father?

14:08.147 --> 14:12.685
Slaving away here on his
own, on your science project

14:12.785 --> 14:15.588
while you gallivant
around the countryside.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.722
Well, Pop, I, er-

14:19.058 --> 14:20.459
Now look what you made me do.

14:20.559 --> 14:23.429
Don't you care about
this project at all?

14:23.529 --> 14:26.532
I do Pop, but I think
it matters more to you

14:26.632 --> 14:28.300
than it does to me.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.269
I'll be down at the museum,

14:30.369 --> 14:33.239
helping Bert set up
his science project.

14:33.339 --> 14:34.106
Cedric!

14:35.441 --> 14:39.144
Cedric wait! I was
just trying to help.

14:40.613 --> 14:44.884
I was just trying to
help, son. That's all.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.792
Boy, that was close.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.829
We tracked that raccoon
down just in time.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.467
Now all we've got to do is
get those bones away from him

15:01.567 --> 15:03.435
and make peace with Snag.

15:07.873 --> 15:10.309
Before he makes pieces of us.

15:19.585 --> 15:23.656
You see the trouble is,
it means so much to him.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.624
He really wants to help.

15:25.724 --> 15:29.261
I guess he just doesn't
notice he's driving me crazy.

15:29.361 --> 15:31.764
Gee. That's tough, Cedric.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.766
So what are you gonna do?

15:33.866 --> 15:34.967
I don't know.

15:35.067 --> 15:37.303
I guess I'll go
back and talk to him

15:37.403 --> 15:39.471
after we've both
cooled off a bit.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.106
Well, I'll tell you, Cedric.

15:41.206 --> 15:42.841
I'm glad you're here.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.277
I don't think I could have
finished this by myself

15:45.377 --> 15:48.747
before tomorrow and besides...

15:48.847 --> 15:52.685
Yeah. This place gives
me the willies too.

15:53.552 --> 15:55.187
Pass me a bone, will ya?

15:55.287 --> 15:56.956
- Okay, Bert.
- Thanks.

15:58.357 --> 16:00.359
Where do you figure this goes?

16:00.459 --> 16:04.997
I don't know, Bert. They all
look sort of the same to me.

16:05.097 --> 16:09.101
What kind of dinosaur
do you figure this is?

16:09.201 --> 16:11.637
I don't know, but it's big.

16:12.504 --> 16:14.206
We've got to get rid of them

16:14.306 --> 16:17.042
before we can get Snag's bones.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.411
Oh, let's make some plan.

16:27.286 --> 16:28.454
M-m-mummies.

16:31.357 --> 16:32.992
Very spooky.

16:33.092 --> 16:35.828
Yeah, let's not hang around.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.429
Quick! Get away from that thing.

16:37.529 --> 16:40.032
You want to bring down the
curse of the mummy's tomb?

16:40.899 --> 16:43.235
As a matter of fact, yes.

16:48.540 --> 16:51.477
Hmm, Cedric said
he'd be in here.

16:56.582 --> 16:57.316
Aargh!

16:57.416 --> 16:58.417
What are you?

16:58.517 --> 17:00.819
Nevermind.

17:00.919 --> 17:03.322
You go first, Snaggy-paws.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.893
Cedric? Cedric my boy.

17:07.993 --> 17:09.428
Where are you?

17:09.528 --> 17:11.096
Nice place to visit.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.132
But I wouldn't wanna live here.

17:13.232 --> 17:15.267
Hey, Snag.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.803
Snag?

17:17.903 --> 17:18.837
Snag?

17:18.937 --> 17:20.873
This isn't funny, Snag.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.975
C-C-Cedric.

17:23.075 --> 17:24.176
Do you hear something?

17:35.120 --> 17:37.456
Cedric? Snag?

17:37.556 --> 17:39.024
Anybody?

17:40.993 --> 17:41.727
What was that?

17:41.827 --> 17:43.729
I dunno, C-Cedric.

17:43.829 --> 17:46.331
I-I just wanna get outta here.

17:46.432 --> 17:49.201
Come on boys. We're
almost home free.

17:53.305 --> 17:56.208
It was nice knowing
ya, Cedric old buddy.

17:56.308 --> 17:57.943
You too, Bert.

18:00.279 --> 18:01.346
Cedric.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.281
B-Bert.

18:03.515 --> 18:04.283
Cedric?

18:05.417 --> 18:06.151
Pop!

18:06.251 --> 18:07.619
Mister Sneer!

18:07.719 --> 18:09.188
Get behind me.

18:09.288 --> 18:11.957
I'll protect you from
those walking rag bags.

18:12.057 --> 18:15.327
Boy, Pop. Am I
ever glad to see you.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.797
Well, you know me, son,
always trying to help.

18:18.897 --> 18:20.199
Don't worry, boys.

18:20.299 --> 18:22.134
I'll get to the bottom of this.

18:23.402 --> 18:25.537
We gotta get
outta here.

18:26.839 --> 18:27.806
No, Snag!

18:27.906 --> 18:28.774
Stop!

18:33.345 --> 18:35.681
I think we lost him.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.750
Start thinking and
get us outta here!

18:42.988 --> 18:43.889
What the?

18:45.924 --> 18:46.758
Jump!

18:49.795 --> 18:50.629
Pigs!

18:50.729 --> 18:51.930
What in the name of King Tut

18:52.030 --> 18:54.500
do you bandaged bimbos
think you're doing?

18:55.434 --> 18:57.002
Call him off, boss!

18:57.102 --> 19:00.005
We'll never ask
for a raise again.

19:00.105 --> 19:02.741
Oh, please call him off.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.776
We'll do anything.

19:04.877 --> 19:08.680
Ah, what a rotten thing to do.

19:08.780 --> 19:13.352
Planting fake bones,
Snag's bones at that.

19:13.452 --> 19:14.953
When I'm finished with them,

19:15.053 --> 19:17.322
they'll regret this
bit of skullduggery.

19:17.422 --> 19:18.824
I promise!

19:19.958 --> 19:22.628
Seems there's been
too much interference

19:22.728 --> 19:24.863
in your science projects.

19:24.963 --> 19:27.232
I came to say I'm sorry, Cedric.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.868
I got a little carried away.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.671
I just wanted to help out.

19:32.771 --> 19:34.206
I know that, Pop.

19:34.306 --> 19:37.576
So I guess you won't be
entering your pedal plane

19:37.676 --> 19:39.077
in the science fair.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.413
No Pop! It wouldn't be right.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.749
I didn't build it myself.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.951
I guess I wrecked
your chance of winning.

19:46.051 --> 19:49.488
Well Pop, I'd still like
to work on the pedal plane.

19:49.588 --> 19:51.823
I mean, it might be fun,

19:51.924 --> 19:54.560
you and me really
working together.

19:54.660 --> 19:57.296
We might even get it in the air.

19:57.396 --> 19:58.564
Guaranteed, son.

19:58.664 --> 20:00.299
Hey, look at this.

20:00.399 --> 20:03.035
This isn't one of Snag's bones.

20:03.135 --> 20:06.104
But they all came
from the tar pit, Bert.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.906
So that means-

20:08.006 --> 20:11.343
It means this is a
real dinosaur bone!

20:12.744 --> 20:13.779
Ha ha. Yahoo!

20:17.616 --> 20:20.452
And to Bert
Raccoon, first prize

20:22.087 --> 20:25.023
for his discovery
of the metatarsal

20:26.158 --> 20:28.760
belonging to a
Tyrannosaurus rex.

20:31.096 --> 20:34.166
Congratulations Rex, er, Bert.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.668
Well done, Bert.

20:36.768 --> 20:39.504
And I do hope you
enjoy your prize.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.173
Way to go, Bert.

20:41.273 --> 20:42.641
Thanks guys.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.376
But I'm not finished yet.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.545
I got that foot bone
and Cedric and I

20:46.645 --> 20:48.380
are gonna find the rest of them.

20:48.480 --> 20:49.715
Right, Cedric old buddy?

20:49.815 --> 20:51.383
You bet, Bert.

20:51.483 --> 20:54.186
And you and me are
gonna go in style

20:54.286 --> 20:58.957
on account of first prize
is a deluxe two-man tent.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.293
Wahoo.

21:01.393 --> 21:02.527
What was that?

21:02.628 --> 21:03.829
That's my Pop.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.531
We finished the pedal
plane this morning.

21:06.632 --> 21:07.466
Geronimo!

21:10.402 --> 21:12.337
Boy, some guys
have all the fun

21:13.538 --> 21:14.439
And us.

21:14.539 --> 21:16.842
We live a dogs life.

21:17.876 --> 21:20.345
Yes, Snag. Right away.

21:22.147 --> 21:23.882
Is that where this one goes?

21:23.982 --> 21:25.284
Whatever you say, boy.

21:26.718 --> 21:28.920
Where does this one go?

21:29.021 --> 21:30.122
Right there.

21:30.222 --> 21:32.424
Oh, that's a
great spot for it.

21:32.524 --> 21:34.393
Good boy, Snag.

21:34.493 --> 21:35.894
Relax.

21:35.994 --> 21:38.163
Such a nice dog, isn't he?

21:39.665 --> 21:41.166
