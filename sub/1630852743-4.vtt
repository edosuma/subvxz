00:18.550 --> 00:19.850
I'm bleeding.

Let's go, baby!

00:22.890 --> 00:25.150
Hector, I'm gonna have to
ask you for your apron.

- Hello.
- I've come to fight, today.

01:44.030 --> 01:45.830
You've gotten a taste
at Boot Camp

01:45.840 --> 01:46.970
over these last couple weeks,

01:46.970 --> 01:49.970
but now it's time to turn you
into seasoned chefs.

All right, let's not get crazy.

Today is all about understanding

the world of flavor.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.910
- [Cliff] Mmm!
- Okay!

01:59.920 --> 02:00.610
I got flavor.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.180
To test your taste buds

02:02.180 --> 02:04.920
we're gonna kick things off
with a little game we like to call

one recruit from each team

02:13.860 --> 02:16.830
will taste a giant bowl of pasta

02:16.830 --> 02:21.240
and identify the two flavors
in each dish.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.900
[Cliff] To make sure
that you're relying solely

02:23.910 --> 02:26.040
on your taste buds
and nothing else,

02:26.040 --> 02:27.540
you will be blindfolded

02:27.540 --> 02:29.140
with your hands
behind your back.

- PTSD!

the flavors

in their dishes of pasta

02:37.550 --> 02:38.990

at the end of the game

First up, Eddie and Al!

<i>[Eddie] Who comes up
with these games?</i>

03:00.210 --> 03:03.010

behind a magic curtain

with her cats just like...

03:05.110 --> 03:06.310
[imitates evil laugh]

[laughs evilly]

03:09.850 --> 03:11.320
[Anne] Recruits, on your mark.

Come on, dig deep, Al!
Dig deep!

right. Eddie, what you got?

03:28.100 --> 03:30.100
Alfredo and garlic.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.540
No. Al, for the steal?

03:32.540 --> 03:34.840
Alfredo and Parmesan.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.540
- No.
- Oh, man.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.910
[Anne] This was pancetta
and Parmesan.

03:38.910 --> 03:40.810
That was good, though.
[laughs]

03:40.820 --> 03:42.520
[Cliff] Cheyenne and Angie.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.180

- All right, Angie.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.220
- Mushrooms?
- And?

03:49.230 --> 03:50.520
- [tense music]
- Cheese?

03:50.530 --> 03:51.730
No, Cheyenne?

03:51.730 --> 03:54.190
Parmesan and... basil?

03:54.200 --> 03:57.430
[Anne] No. It is eggplant
and anchovy.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.200
[all exclaim in disgust]

04:00.240 --> 04:02.740
[Cliff] Next, Kara and Bianca.

04:02.740 --> 04:04.000

04:04.010 --> 04:05.910
I've never stuck
my head in pasta,

but I've always wanted to.

04:08.110 --> 04:09.840
- Taste.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.080
Check that off my bucket list.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.290
[cheering]

04:21.290 --> 04:22.690
Oh, honey.

04:22.690 --> 04:23.760
Keep your eyes closed.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.190
Keep your eyes closed,
there you go.

04:25.190 --> 04:26.990
- [laughing hysterically]
- Oh, my God. Girl!

04:27.000 --> 04:28.260
[buzzer dings]

04:28.260 --> 04:29.800
Bianca, what do you think it is?

04:29.800 --> 04:31.870
Alfredo sauce and an herb.

04:31.870 --> 04:32.730
- No.
- [buzzer blares]

04:32.740 --> 04:34.940
[chuckling] Um, Kara?

04:34.940 --> 04:37.140

Next, Peachez and Hilda.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.380
[rock 'n' roll music]

04:49.680 --> 04:51.820
This mug is way too beautiful

04:51.820 --> 04:53.990
to be just shoving
my face into pasta,

04:53.990 --> 04:55.960
<i>but I'mma do
what has to be done.</i>

04:55.960 --> 04:56.960
On your marks, get set, taste.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.990
[Cheyenne] Dig deep, dig deep!

04:58.990 --> 05:01.300
- Dig deep, go from the sides.
- [buzzer dings]

05:01.300 --> 05:02.260
All right, Peachez.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.200
It's garlic and clams?

05:04.200 --> 05:06.230
- Yes, very good!
- [all cheer]

05:06.240 --> 05:07.930
Whoo!

05:07.940 --> 05:08.840
I got a palate!

Yeah, you do.

05:10.070 --> 05:12.010
[sing-song] Oh, oh, oh,
I got it right!

05:12.070 --> 05:13.310

I know these flavors!
I got it right!

05:16.210 --> 05:17.810
[Cliff] Marti and Cheyenne.

05:17.810 --> 05:19.680
All right.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.020
-Taste.
-[Peachez] Lean in, honey! Lean in.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.720
Taste it, taste it.
You got this.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.920
Forget about that make-up,
girl, just go, go, go!

05:26.920 --> 05:29.360
- [buzzer dings] - Yeah, all
right, Marti, what you got?

05:34.030 --> 05:35.260
- Incorrect.

Lemon and...

05:37.930 --> 05:39.170
- broccoli?
- No.

05:39.170 --> 05:41.070
It's lemon and artichoke.

05:41.070 --> 05:42.770
[Marti] Oh, it's artichoke!

05:42.770 --> 05:44.400
- [grunts]
- [Marti] I knew that!

05:44.910 --> 05:46.910
[Cliff] Eddie and Kara.

05:46.910 --> 05:49.110
The score is still
one point for the Blue Team,

05:49.110 --> 05:50.810
no points for the Red Team.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.250
- Okay...
- Taste.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.810
[Peachez] Go, Eddie!

05:53.820 --> 05:56.320
There's no way I'm letting the
Blue Team take this from us.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.850
I'm sorry, Eddie.

05:57.850 --> 05:59.190
You're going down.

06:00.090 --> 06:01.090
Kara, what you got?

06:01.090 --> 06:02.560
- Peas.
- And?

06:02.560 --> 06:03.820
Don't do this to me, baby.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.330
- Do it to him.
- [all] Do it to him.

06:05.330 --> 06:06.860
Do, it, do it, do it!

06:06.860 --> 06:08.230
- Oh, tuna!
- Yes!

06:08.230 --> 06:10.160
[all clamor]

06:12.730 --> 06:15.270
All right, recruits,
the score is tied.

06:15.270 --> 06:18.270
Up next, Al and Melody. Taste.

06:18.270 --> 06:20.240
[Peachez] Dig deep, Mel!
Dig deep!

06:20.240 --> 06:22.040
[all cheering]

06:22.310 --> 06:24.010
Mozzarella cheese...

06:25.350 --> 06:26.210
Basil?

06:26.220 --> 06:28.280
Yes, very good!

06:29.220 --> 06:30.880
I told you, Blue Team,
I got you.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.550
- Hello.
- [grunts]

06:32.550 --> 06:35.760
All right, recruits,
the true palate pros are...

06:35.760 --> 06:37.060
the Blue Team!

06:39.690 --> 06:41.030
For today's Skill Drill cook,

06:41.030 --> 06:43.060
Anne and I will each
teach you all

06:43.070 --> 06:46.230
how to make a flavor-packed
bowl of mac and cheese.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.830
[all murmur excitedly]

06:47.840 --> 06:49.840
And then you'll each
put your own spin

06:49.840 --> 06:51.200
on custom toppings and mix-ins.

06:51.210 --> 06:52.740
Congratulations, Blue Team.

06:52.740 --> 06:55.210
Your team will get to pick
three cheeses

06:55.210 --> 06:57.780
that you will have
exclusive access to.

06:57.780 --> 06:59.380
- [Peachez] Oh!
- Okay.

07:01.550 --> 07:05.190
We have chosen the Gouda,
the provolone and the Manchego.

07:05.190 --> 07:07.720
Recruits, let's go
attack that mac!

07:07.720 --> 07:10.220
Okay, Rocking Red Stars,
step into my office.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.230
So, recruits, today I'll be
showing you how to make

07:12.230 --> 07:15.060
a truffle, pea and chive
mac and cheese.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.530
My Rocking Red Stars.

07:17.530 --> 07:20.030
I'm going to demo
macaroni and cheese

07:20.040 --> 07:25.110
<i>with Gruyère, Fontina,
Parmesan, and pancetta.</i>

07:25.810 --> 07:27.840
I'm starting off
with my pancetta.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.040
I'm dicing it.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.750
We're gonna do
what's called rendering.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.820
I'm rendering the fat
out of the bacon.

07:34.820 --> 07:36.320
[Cliff] We're gonna start
cooking the pasta.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.220
<i>I'm using campanelle pasta.</i>

07:38.220 --> 07:39.120
<i>Then we're making a roux,</i>

07:39.120 --> 07:41.020
<i>and a roux is
the thickening agent.</i>

07:41.020 --> 07:44.090
That is how the mac and cheese
is thick and it's creamy.

07:44.090 --> 07:46.930
Beautiful skill all these
recruits are gonna learn

07:46.930 --> 07:49.060
is how to make a Mornay sauce,

07:49.560 --> 07:51.030
one of the mother sauces.

07:51.030 --> 07:54.000
<i>And this is that creamy,
rich viscosity</i>

07:54.000 --> 07:55.770
that's actually in
your mac and cheese.

07:55.770 --> 07:56.900
Cool.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.170
I'm gonna start with
one stick of butter,

07:58.170 --> 08:00.710
one whole shallot,
one clove of garlic,

08:00.710 --> 08:03.080
one cup of flour,
a pinch of nutmeg.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.010
We're going to cook
the flour out

08:04.010 --> 08:07.410
and then we are going to
add our milk.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.520
Now I'm gonna start working
in four cups of cheese.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.620
I'm using white Cheddar.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.750
Gently stir it in,
little by little.

08:12.750 --> 08:16.960
My pancetta is looking
nice and brown and crispy,

08:16.960 --> 08:19.760
so I'm gonna take it
out of here.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.130
But, see? The fat falls out.

08:21.130 --> 08:23.330
I'm gonna use that
<i>to make the roux.</i>

08:23.330 --> 08:25.670
Then I'm just gonna add
onions right to that,

08:25.670 --> 08:28.600
a couple tablespoons of
butter, flour, and then mustard

08:28.600 --> 08:31.970
adds a really nice, big,
zesty flavor kick.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.970
And I'm gonna add
a couple shots of hot sauce

08:33.980 --> 08:36.080
- just to make it exciting.
- I love that.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.910
And then we're adding
milk to this.

08:37.910 --> 08:40.180
Half a cup of breadcrumb
and my thyme.

08:40.180 --> 08:41.780
The thyme is just to flavor
the breadcrumb

08:41.780 --> 08:43.780
and all that deliciousness.

08:43.790 --> 08:46.890
[Anne] Now, when it comes to the
cheese in my macaroni and cheese,

08:46.890 --> 08:50.660
I'm gonna use Gruyère,
Fontina and Parmesan.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.790
<i>Parmigiano is very salty
and kind of nutty</i>

08:53.800 --> 08:56.900
and gives a real depth
of flavor to everything.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.930
Mac and cheese is kind of a
blank canvas for a lot of stuff.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.840
<i>I want my recruits
to get in there</i>

09:01.840 --> 09:04.040

the world of cheese.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.540
It's delightful and stinky.

09:06.540 --> 09:08.210
[Cliff] I'm gonna strain
my pasta.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.540
Now I'm gonna marry
all of this together.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.450
- [Wedding March playing]
- Pasta, hello!

09:13.210 --> 09:15.020
One cup of peas.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.950
Now my pasta.

09:16.950 --> 09:18.220
Stir it right in there.

09:18.220 --> 09:21.120
I'm gonna add these crispy
little bacon bits back in there.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.720
All right, let's plate.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.230
I have some breadcrumbs.
Put them on the top,

09:25.230 --> 09:27.760
and I'm just gonna put these
guys in the oven to brown them

09:27.760 --> 09:29.060
till they get
really nice and crispy.

09:29.060 --> 09:30.760
There you go, mac...

09:30.770 --> 09:33.730
I'm gonna take our friendly
neighborhood black truffle.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.970
The truffle is a, uh,
super fun guy.

09:35.970 --> 09:38.340

Just like that.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.170
[Marti] All right, Hilda!

16:54.040 --> 16:55.110
Al's just eating cheese
over there.

16:55.110 --> 16:56.310
I love cheese.

16:56.310 --> 16:57.640
Coming up on one minute.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.710
Let's pull it together.

16:59.710 --> 17:02.180
Like, who doesn't like
some spicy puffs, right?

17:02.180 --> 17:06.890
I gotta get these cheese puffs on
top, so I just mush them all together.

17:06.890 --> 17:09.820
- Oh!
- Hot, hot, hot!

17:09.820 --> 17:15.190
- [Kara] Hot, hot.
- [Cliff and Anne] Five, four, three, two, one!

17:15.200 --> 17:18.100
- That's it, hands up!
- [Marti] All right, good job, everyone!

17:18.100 --> 17:18.900
Here we go.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.870
Oh, I'm so excited!

17:20.870 --> 17:22.970
You ready to go try
some mac and cheese?

17:22.970 --> 17:25.740
- Let's go eat some mac and cheese.
- I am excited for this one.

17:25.740 --> 17:26.770
Kara, you're up first,

17:26.780 --> 17:28.110
Here you go, Chef Anne.

17:28.110 --> 17:31.780
There's a white wine mac
and cheese with Gorgonzola,

17:31.780 --> 17:35.010
Monterey jack,
<i>and 'guerrero' cheese?</i>

17:35.020 --> 17:39.190
-Gruyère.
-Gruyère, that cheese. With carrots and chives.

17:39.190 --> 17:42.690
Never have I ever seen carrots
in a mac and cheese before.

17:42.690 --> 17:44.120
It's a little kooky.

17:44.130 --> 17:49.800
Your bacon looks like it's
cut and cooked unevenly,

17:49.800 --> 17:52.470
but the mac and cheese itself
is nice and creamy,

17:52.470 --> 17:55.540
- and the pasta is cooked nicely.
- Thank you.

17:55.540 --> 18:00.140
- All right, Marti.
- Bicep and tricep workout with this mac and cheese.

18:00.140 --> 18:02.740
So, I saw that lobster and
[imitates whip crack] did it up,

18:02.740 --> 18:06.110
got Brie, sharp white Cheddar,
Fontina's in there.

18:06.110 --> 18:08.350
We have some hot sauce
just to give it a little extra kick.

18:08.350 --> 18:11.650
The texture is nice and creamy.
Your lobster is overcooked.

18:11.650 --> 18:13.120
Oh, man!

18:13.120 --> 18:14.950
- But I like where you were going with that.
- Cool.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.020
- Awesome. Thank you so much.
- Nice job.

18:17.030 --> 18:19.690
- Hilda!
- Knock 'em dead, here I come.

18:19.690 --> 18:20.760
[Anne] So, what's in here?

18:20.760 --> 18:24.060
Crab meat, broccoli,
bacon, grilled pepper,

18:24.070 --> 18:27.070
black truffles, mozzarella,
and the goat cheese.

18:27.070 --> 18:30.770
This wound up to be
a kitchen-sink mac and cheese.

18:30.770 --> 18:34.010
I would have picked one lane
and gone in it.

18:34.010 --> 18:35.110
I'll do better next time.

18:35.110 --> 18:37.040
All right, big Al, come on up.

18:37.050 --> 18:39.680
[Anne] So, talk to me
about what you made.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.010
I made a twist on Tex-Mex.

18:41.020 --> 18:45.920
I used sharp Cheddar,
bacon, onion, garlic.

18:45.920 --> 18:49.020
I can tell very distinctly where you
were going with this flavor profile,

18:49.020 --> 18:51.790
and it tastes really good.

18:51.790 --> 18:53.060
- Good job.
- Thank you.

18:53.060 --> 18:54.160
Angie, come on up.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.930
We're having
a Mexican party today.

18:55.930 --> 18:57.900
Wow, that is quite a color.

18:57.900 --> 19:03.300
<i>I have chorizo and onions
together with three types of cheese.</i>

19:03.300 --> 19:05.910
I like the direction you were
going with your flavor profile.

19:05.910 --> 19:08.770
It's a little low
on the seasoning.

19:08.780 --> 19:11.310
- The onions and the jalapeños are not cooked enough.
- Okay.

19:11.310 --> 19:13.210
- But good job.
- Thanks, Chef.

19:13.210 --> 19:15.880
Okay, Blue Team.
Bianca, you're up first.

19:15.880 --> 19:16.980
[Cliff] What have
you made today?

19:16.990 --> 19:19.920
My daughters love spicy stuff,

19:19.920 --> 19:24.020
and bacon, and they also
like pork rinds.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.730
- Okay, these are two of my favorite food groups. Yes.
- Oh.

19:26.730 --> 19:31.000
So I figured why not add
some spice to it and make it fun?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.070
[cork pops] [party horn blows]

19:33.070 --> 19:36.300
The pasta itself is
cooked perfectly.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.770
The pancetta isn't
cooked enough,

19:38.770 --> 19:40.840
- so it's like soggy cubes.
- Okay.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.010
What I do love is
the creativity.

19:43.010 --> 19:46.010
Topping a mac and cheese
with pork rinds, very bad [bleep]

19:46.010 --> 19:47.380
Oh.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.150
That's why they call me
[donkey brays] Bianca.

19:49.150 --> 19:50.520
[Cliff] Eddie.

19:51.150 --> 19:55.250
I decided to incorporate
provolone, Gouda,

19:55.260 --> 19:57.590
and late to the show was
Parmesan sprinkled on top.

19:57.590 --> 19:58.820
Your pasta's a touch under.

19:58.830 --> 20:03.230
The cheeses are working, but
your Mornay did not cook out.

20:03.230 --> 20:06.770
- It's an unpleasant mouthfeel.
- Thank you.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.130
- Cheyenne.
- Go get 'em, Chey.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.640
[Cliff] What do we have here?

20:09.640 --> 20:13.040
Honey-pepper-mushroom
mac and cheese.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.340
There's a lot of honey. It's
actually crushing my palate.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.440
- Now everything's just sweet.
- Okay.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.550
[Cliff] Peachez.

20:20.550 --> 20:24.550
I made my 'when the party
is over' mac and cheese

20:24.550 --> 20:26.450
with Gorgonzola and pear.

20:26.450 --> 20:28.720
The Gouda and pear work.
I can't say that they don't.

20:28.720 --> 20:33.160
I love Gorgonzola, but I don't
want a gigantic bowl of Gorgonzola.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.000
- No, no.
- Gorgonzola should not be in this party right now.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.100
[imitating bouncer] Name's not on the
list. You're not welcome here, Gorgy.

20:40.230 --> 20:41.830
[Cliff] Melody.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.900
I used aged Provolone.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.670
There is some jalapeño
there as well.

20:46.670 --> 20:48.270
I took your advice
from last week

20:48.280 --> 20:51.610
and made sure that I invited
salt to the party.

20:51.610 --> 20:54.110
- It's a touch salty.
- Mmm-hmm.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.780
I'm happier with that than it
being a bland bowl of food.

20:56.780 --> 21:00.320
- The base of your sauce is actually damn good.
- Yeah.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.920
And you should be really,
really freaking happy with this.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.260
[crowd cheers]

21:06.260 --> 21:11.400
There was one Rocking Red Star
who was extra sparkly.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.300
That recruit is big Al.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.600
[all cheering]

21:15.600 --> 21:18.200
Yes! I nailed it!

21:18.210 --> 21:21.040
The winner of the Skill Drill
challenge on the Blue Team is...

21:21.910 --> 21:22.810
Melody.

21:22.810 --> 21:23.910
[all cheering]

21:23.910 --> 21:27.810
Yes! We finally won something.
It's about time, honey.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.980
All right, recruits, you'll need to
really show us your culinary chops

21:30.990 --> 21:32.520
for this next challenge.

21:32.520 --> 21:36.990
We are going to show you guys
how to make a very elegant dish

21:36.990 --> 21:39.190
that will be sure to impress.

21:39.190 --> 21:41.590
Today I'm going to
show you how to make

21:41.600 --> 21:43.430
<i>a pistachio-crusted
rack of lamb,</i>

21:43.430 --> 21:45.900
<i>date couscous,
and Baharat-spiced carrots.</i>

21:45.900 --> 21:47.670
Yum!

21:47.670 --> 21:52.340
All right, I'm going to show you how
to make an herb-crusted rack of lamb

21:52.340 --> 21:56.680
<i>with a harissa sauce and
a saffron Israeli couscous.</i>

21:56.680 --> 21:58.840
Ooh, I love couscous!

21:58.850 --> 22:00.680
I'm going to start
with the crust.

22:00.680 --> 22:01.910
We're gonna toast our pistachio.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.320
Two tablespoons
of melted butter,

22:03.320 --> 22:04.920
one quarter-cup of breadcrumb.

22:04.920 --> 22:08.920
Pistachios are toasted.
I'm going to pulse them.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.990
Then I'm adding our pistachio,
season it with a little bit of salt...

22:11.990 --> 22:15.130
We're gonna have to break down
our own rack of lamb.

22:15.130 --> 22:16.130
[crowd cheers]

22:16.130 --> 22:19.100
In this side, there is
the shoulder blade,

22:19.100 --> 22:20.500
and we're gonna
just pull it right out.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.770
Oh, my word.

22:21.770 --> 22:24.970
Anne is diving into this rack
of lamb like she is Dexter,

22:24.970 --> 22:27.140
just slicing and dicing
bodies left, right, and center.

22:27.140 --> 22:28.640
This is scary.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.840
[Anne] This little pocket
of meat, right above it,

22:31.850 --> 22:35.110
we're gonna make an
incision right to the first bone.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.820
- And we're just gonna connect the dots.
- [sheep bleats]

22:37.820 --> 22:39.750
[Anne] Cutting right down
to the bone.

22:39.750 --> 22:41.950
And then what we're gonna do is
kind of expose these little bones.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.720
We're just gonna start
to pull these bones forward.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.530
- [contestants agreeing] - And
then, look, that pulls right off.

22:47.530 --> 22:51.000
There we go. So our bones
are Frenched, nice and clean.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.770
I'm gonna sear the lamb. I
don't want to burn up my pan,

22:54.770 --> 22:57.000
because I want to use it
for my sauce.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.140
While my lamb is down,
my carrots, olive oil,

23:00.140 --> 23:03.180
and then our mint, coriander,
and cardamom spice mix.

23:03.180 --> 23:07.050
So, my lamb and my carrots are
actually gonna cook at the same time.

23:07.050 --> 23:09.720
[Anne] Let's get this crusted.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.890
I'm gonna brush my lamb
with Dijon mustard.

23:12.890 --> 23:14.550
It really helps
to make things stick.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.060
Some pistachio crust.
Get it on there.

23:17.060 --> 23:19.160
And then we're gonna
put it in the oven to finish it.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.990
I'm going to start my couscous.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.200
Vegetable broth.
In the pot goes the cinnamon.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.730
One cup of couscous. Dates.

23:26.730 --> 23:30.240
We have Israeli couscous,
fennel, zucchini,

23:30.240 --> 23:33.870
couscous, saffron
and some chickpeas.

23:33.880 --> 23:34.870
Perfect, done.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.980
My harissa sauce,
fennel and onion

23:37.980 --> 23:39.080
are starting
to get a little bit brown.

23:39.080 --> 23:41.550
Some garlic in there, tomatoes.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.820
Little bit of
a chunky kind of situation.

23:43.820 --> 23:47.790
Then I'm gonna add harissa
and some chicken stock, all right?

23:47.790 --> 23:50.260
Because we need
the saucy part of our sauce.

23:50.260 --> 23:51.760
So, now we're gonna
work on sauce.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.760
Our shallot goes in. One
bay leaf, black peppercorn.

23:54.760 --> 23:58.560
Two sprigs of thyme. And what
am I trying to do to the shallots?

23:58.570 --> 24:01.070
- Sweat them.
- [Cliff] Sweat them.

24:01.070 --> 24:03.100
I'm going to add
my crushed garlic.

24:03.100 --> 24:06.740
Red wine, veal demi.
I'm gonna add half a cup,

24:06.740 --> 24:08.610
and we're gonna continue
to reduce that.

24:08.610 --> 24:11.010
- We're ready to plate.
- [contestants] All right.

24:11.010 --> 24:14.350
We're gonna slice our lamb
in half very carefully.

24:14.350 --> 24:16.780
You don't want
to interrupt that crust.

24:16.780 --> 24:21.720
Israeli couscous. Now our
lamb. One half on like that.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.020
- The other half like this, okay?
- [Al] Okay.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.930
So we see the crust,
and we see inside.

24:25.930 --> 24:28.160
And then let's get saucy.

24:28.160 --> 24:33.670
My couscous, super fluff. I'm
gonna give two double chops,

24:33.670 --> 24:36.040
carrots, sauce.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.910
This is how I want your
lamb to be presented.

24:39.910 --> 24:42.240
- You guys want to taste?
- [contestants] Yes.

24:43.310 --> 24:44.440
[Melody] This is so good.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.510
- That sauce is great.
- This is good.

24:48.650 --> 24:50.120
For this challenge...

24:50.120 --> 24:52.050
[whispering] If he says anything
less than two hours, I'm gonna cry.

24:52.050 --> 24:55.790
- You'll have 75 minutes...
- [contestants laugh]

24:55.790 --> 24:58.420
to replicate my sauce and lamb.

24:58.430 --> 25:02.760
You must put your own flavor
spin on the crust and the couscous.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.860
- [contestants] Okay.
- And I want to see big things from you guys.

25:04.870 --> 25:05.830
- All right, yes.
- [Anne] All right?

25:05.830 --> 25:08.670
- Your time has started.
- Oh. [sighs]

25:08.670 --> 25:12.070
- [contestants] Go, go, go.
- [Anne] All right, let's go, my Rocking Red Stars.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.280
Okay, wait. Don't take
all the raisins. Hold up.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.740
Kara, how about <i>some mise en
place containers right off the bat?</i>

25:18.750 --> 25:20.350
Okay.

25:20.350 --> 25:23.220
All right, little lamb. I'm gonna
cut you up, boo. [sheep bleats]

25:23.220 --> 25:27.290
We have 75 minutes to make
this ridiculously intricate meal.

25:27.290 --> 25:30.060
"Butcher lamb."
Great instructions, boo.

25:30.060 --> 25:31.190
She's lost her mind.

25:31.190 --> 25:32.760
[gags]

25:32.760 --> 25:33.960
Oh, my God. [gags]

25:33.960 --> 25:37.130
- This is disgusting.
- [sheep bleats]

25:37.130 --> 25:42.070
Oh, yeah. Come on.
Get off of there.

25:42.070 --> 25:43.270
This is too much.

25:43.270 --> 25:46.410
Boom. Thank you for coming.
Get out of here.

25:46.740 --> 25:48.210
[gags] Okay.

25:50.180 --> 25:53.350
Hilda, can you
use your boning knife, please?

25:54.980 --> 25:58.750
Thank you.
No, it's got a white handle.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.820
That's not it.

26:00.820 --> 26:02.520
- This one?
- Yes. Please don't...

26:03.960 --> 26:07.190
-Don't do that. Please, don't do that.
-Yes, ma'am. Okay.

26:07.990 --> 26:11.760
Yes, yes.
Thank you for lambing.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.700
It's going to be delicious.
Let's get your lamb in the pan.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.640
- [Both] Lamb in the pan.
- Lamb in the pan.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.910
- Where?
- [Both] In the pan. [cheers]

26:19.910 --> 26:22.940
<i>[Narrator] Now that's
what I call "Lamb Jamz".</i>

26:22.940 --> 26:24.480
Yeah, you need
more flame on that.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.180
- Way more flame.
- Yeah, you need fire.

26:26.180 --> 26:29.180
Flip this so you can get this on a
larger burner, so you can sear that off.

26:32.790 --> 26:34.420
I burned my hand.

26:34.420 --> 26:35.890
- You okay?
- No, I'm really burned.

26:35.890 --> 26:37.490
[sighs]

26:38.960 --> 26:44.230
I run to the sink and start putting
cold water on it. It's not helping.

26:44.230 --> 26:47.100
You know that throbbing sensation
you get when you get a small burn?

26:47.100 --> 26:48.870
Oh, my God, it hurts.

26:48.870 --> 26:51.640
This is how my hand
is feeling times 1,000.

26:51.640 --> 26:52.870
I'm gonna run out of time.

26:52.870 --> 26:55.370
My hand is throbbing,
and everybody's still working.

26:55.380 --> 26:56.510
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

26:56.510 --> 26:57.610
[sighs]

27:02.920 --> 27:05.220
I can't even, like,
open this finger all the way.

27:05.220 --> 27:07.920
My hand is throbbing,
and everybody's still working.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.290
I'm gonna run out of time.

27:15.860 --> 27:17.160
- Yeah.
- Okay?

27:17.360 --> 27:20.570
Chef Cliff is being so
encouraging, and he believes in me.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.800
You got this, Chey.
Stay positive.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.470
I have to ignore this pain,
and get on with this cook.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.910
[Cheyenne] Okay.
I finish the crust. Okay.

27:31.910 --> 27:33.280
One hour, everybody.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.710
- Get your onions and fennel in the pan.
- Yes, ma'am.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.550
You just cut
the wrong end of that onion.

27:39.850 --> 27:41.920
- Don't look, don't look.
- You waited for me to come here

27:41.920 --> 27:43.220
- to do that.
- Don't look.

27:43.220 --> 27:46.130
I don't really see the bone that
I'm supposed to be removing.

27:46.130 --> 27:48.590
I have no clue what I'm doing.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.960
- Peachez, you good?
- Not great.

27:50.970 --> 27:54.800
I'm a little concerned about
the way this meat is going.

27:54.800 --> 27:58.240
The rest of the Blue Team is
essentially done butchering this lamb,

27:58.240 --> 28:00.210
and I am barely
getting down to the bone.

28:00.210 --> 28:03.110
It's so quiet in here, it's
like <i>The Silence of the Lamb.</i>

28:03.110 --> 28:05.180
- [Peachez laughs]
- [sheep bleats]

28:05.180 --> 28:07.210
I still have a sense of humor
in my panic.

28:11.950 --> 28:13.350
Talk to me, Melody.

28:14.690 --> 28:18.790
I'm okay. [laughs] I'm like
a cluster [bleep] right now.

28:18.790 --> 28:20.330
Flip your lamb, please,
when you can.

28:20.330 --> 28:24.000
Regroup and focus. [sighs]
Regroup and focus.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
Hey-oh.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.840
[Anne] So, you guys, the
first thing I want you to do,

28:29.840 --> 28:31.940
after you get your lamb
in the oven, is the crust.

28:31.940 --> 28:33.610
Oh, the crust. [bleep]

28:33.610 --> 28:37.040
-[Peachez] What's burning? Oh, your pistachios, baby.
-Oh... Thank you.

28:37.040 --> 28:40.010
-Oh, they burned, they burned.
-Dump 'em. Dump 'em. They're garbage.

28:40.550 --> 28:43.920
[groans] Here I go,
back to basics.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.880
Watching Bianca cook,
it's like watching a see-saw.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.720
Ai-yai-yai. [bleep]

28:47.720 --> 28:49.960
It's up, it's down.
It's up, it's down.

28:49.960 --> 28:53.990
- Leave it, you're good.
- I totally forgot I had to do this.

28:53.990 --> 28:55.390
Nice recovery, Bianca.

28:57.100 --> 28:57.830
[blows raspberry]

28:57.830 --> 28:59.060
Killing me.

29:00.400 --> 29:03.400
Ah. [bleep] What am I
doing? This isn't ready.

29:03.840 --> 29:06.210
Oi.

29:06.210 --> 29:12.040
Angie, push your knife. Slice,
like, slice. Not bang, bang, bang.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.980
Sli... Oh, there you go.

29:13.980 --> 29:16.050
I'm feeling good,

29:16.050 --> 29:18.750
because I think all the hounding
she's done has finally sunk in.

29:18.750 --> 29:20.220
I think the fennel's
too much for half.

29:20.220 --> 29:21.790
I don't have to use
all of it, right?

29:21.790 --> 29:24.320
Look at you. Is that you
thinking like a cook? [gasps]

29:24.330 --> 29:26.690
- [chime]
- Ange, who are you today?

29:26.690 --> 29:28.260
- I don't know.
- I like who's here.

29:28.260 --> 29:29.900
Hey, Chef Anne.
Still the same Angie,

29:29.900 --> 29:32.330
just new and improved, you know?

29:32.330 --> 29:35.230
Hold on, you're doing good.
Ah, get over there.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.740
Oh, all that meat.

29:36.740 --> 29:38.900
Crust it and get it
in that oven.

29:38.910 --> 29:42.240
- [Anne] Quick, quick, quick.
- [Cliff] Check your seasoning.

29:42.240 --> 29:46.080
[Anne] Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

29:48.980 --> 29:52.020
All right, baby. What's next?

29:52.020 --> 29:54.550
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.890
Let's get your couscous working.
Let's get that sauce working.

29:57.890 --> 30:00.190
[muttering] Peppercorns.
Two sprigs of thyme.

30:00.190 --> 30:02.160
- Eddie, have you started sauce?
- Yes.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.930
Eddie's doing a fantastic job.

30:03.930 --> 30:05.300
What the frick is the couscous?

30:05.300 --> 30:06.700
Edward, get it together.

30:06.700 --> 30:10.100
And then I've also seen the
other guy, Alternate Eddie,

30:10.100 --> 30:13.840
who doesn't remember
what to do, messy station,

30:13.840 --> 30:15.710
is second-,
third-guessing himself.

30:15.710 --> 30:17.910
- What's in there?
- No, I had accidentally--

30:17.910 --> 30:20.710
- No, answer my question first.
- Shallots.

30:20.710 --> 30:22.750
You gonna pull them out, or are
you gonna leave them in there?

30:22.750 --> 30:25.150
I'm gonna pull out some of
'em. It's all jacked up, Chef.

30:25.150 --> 30:27.190
Okay, listen. Here's what
I want you to do right now.

30:27.190 --> 30:30.120
No, I want you to pull out as
many pieces of shallot out of there,

30:30.120 --> 30:31.720
because I know
they're not cooked,

30:31.730 --> 30:32.960
because I can see
that they're not cooked.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.130
He just gets in his own way.

30:34.130 --> 30:36.830
Put the shallots
in the incorrect pan.

30:36.830 --> 30:38.060
So now I'm paying
for that mistake.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.670
[laughs wickedly]

30:39.670 --> 30:42.170
Y'all, be careful, I think
I spilled a little bit of oil.

30:42.170 --> 30:44.000
If I slip and fall,
we're gonna fight later.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.170
Honey, if you slip and fall,

30:46.170 --> 30:49.010
I will win $25,000
to pay for your medical bills.

30:49.010 --> 30:51.240
- [laughs] - That's
incredibly generous of you.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.210
Whoa. It's slippery there.

30:53.980 --> 30:56.820
30 minutes, recruits.
30 minutes.

30:56.820 --> 30:58.650
You're doing pretty well,
so yay, yay, yay.

30:58.650 --> 31:01.520
Ai-yai-yai-yai-yai.

31:01.520 --> 31:04.020
Teaspoon or one tablespoon of
black peppercorns for the sauce?

31:04.020 --> 31:06.260
It's half a teaspoon
for the peppercorn.

31:06.260 --> 31:07.990
- [Both] Half a teaspoon.
- [Melody] Half a teaspoon.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.860
Oh, it sure is half a
teaspoon. We gonna do this.

31:10.870 --> 31:16.030
Pull your wig down, pull your dress
down, and pull your heart up, baby.

31:16.040 --> 31:21.510
I'm going to make a tasty
curried cauliflower for my side dish.

31:21.510 --> 31:24.480
Why is some of this
cauliflower red on the inside?

31:24.480 --> 31:28.010
[high-pitched voice] "I don't know,
Peachez. It's just flavorful, I guess."

31:28.020 --> 31:31.220
[in normal voice] Or it's
bleeding like the lamb. Oh, [bleep].

31:31.220 --> 31:33.450
- What happened?
- That's what it was.

31:34.850 --> 31:37.720
I apparently
am bleeding. [bleep]

31:37.730 --> 31:42.030
I cannot serve this to the chef.
This is wasting valuable time.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.530
I only have 30 minutes.
I don't feel it at all.

31:44.530 --> 31:46.100
I don't know where
the blood's coming from.

31:46.100 --> 31:48.470
Am I gonna finish this in time?

31:48.940 --> 31:50.500
Find out after the break.

31:55.810 --> 31:58.040
- What happened?
- I apparently am bleeding.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.810
The last thing that I want
to do is bleed into this food.

32:00.810 --> 32:02.750
I think it might be that
little sucker right there.

32:02.750 --> 32:06.250
I do not want to go home.
Not over some little lamb.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.990
- You got this, Peachez, okay?
- I feel fine.

32:08.990 --> 32:12.860
<i>[Narrator] ...lied Peachez, who
did not, in fact, feel fine at all.</i>

32:12.860 --> 32:15.790
All right. Everyone who can,
I want you to be plating.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.160
I know this is
a lot to do today,

32:17.160 --> 32:20.000
but just give
a really good final push

32:20.000 --> 32:21.870
to get everything done,
okay, you guys?

32:21.870 --> 32:24.070
- [contestants] Yes, Chef.
- Thank you.

32:24.900 --> 32:26.200
[Anne] Let's go. Come on.

32:26.210 --> 32:28.710
- [Cliff] You got this.
- [contestant] Ow. Hot pan.

32:28.710 --> 32:31.010
Can you use spoons to plate,
please, Marti?

32:31.010 --> 32:32.640
-Not your hands.
-All right, thank you. Sorry, sorry.

32:32.650 --> 32:34.910
[sighs]

32:34.920 --> 32:36.080
- [Cliff] Hey, recruits, you have one minute.
- [bleep]

32:36.080 --> 32:37.880
[Cliff] Put the couscous
on the plate,

32:37.890 --> 32:40.320
the lamb on the plate,
the vegetables on the plate.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.020
Just cut it, come on.
[claps hands]

32:42.020 --> 32:45.890
- Get enough sauce on there, Peachez. Sauce it, sauce it.
- [Anne] Five, four, three,

32:45.890 --> 32:48.890
- [Anne and Cliff] two, one.
- [Anne] That's it, hands up.

32:48.900 --> 32:53.070
You're done. God, I think
I'm done too, you guys.

32:53.070 --> 32:55.170
- [laughs]
- Yeah, really.

32:55.170 --> 32:57.100
- You ready to go try some lamb?
- I need a drink.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.600
I need something.

32:59.610 --> 33:03.440
Let's see how we did, huh?
Melody, what do we have here?

33:03.440 --> 33:08.710
We have couscous. I used
jalapeño, and my crust is almonds.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.750
The couscous
is cooked perfectly.

33:10.750 --> 33:12.950
I do taste the jalapeño in
there. It could use a bit of salt.

33:12.950 --> 33:16.050
Now, the star of the show
is this lamb.

33:16.060 --> 33:18.060
This lamb is beautiful,
the crust is delicious.

33:18.060 --> 33:21.230
This is a damn good
plate of food.

33:21.230 --> 33:25.960
[sing-song] Bianca, come forth
<i>with your borrego.</i>

33:26.570 --> 33:28.100
Splatter art.

33:30.540 --> 33:34.210
My couscous has basil,
cilantro, and then potatoes.

33:34.210 --> 33:37.910
The crust on my lamb
is walnut and pistachio.

33:37.910 --> 33:40.450
[Cliff] The couscous
is cooked perfectly.

33:40.450 --> 33:44.150
- I really like the herbs in it. And the lamb's spot-on.
- Thank you, Chef.

33:44.150 --> 33:48.390
- [Cliff] Peachez?
- I have a cashew-crusted lamb

33:48.390 --> 33:51.720
with an orange
and cardamom couscous.

33:51.730 --> 33:54.260
I'm pleased with the cook on the
lamb. The cashew crust is fantastic.

33:54.260 --> 33:56.830
- The sauce, it's over-reduced...
- Yeah.

33:56.830 --> 33:59.100
so it's cloyingly sweet.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.770
- The Brussels are seasoned, but they're undercooked.
- Okay.

34:01.770 --> 34:02.900
Thank you very much.

34:02.900 --> 34:04.200
Come join me
with your plate, Eddie.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.870
[Eddie] This is
walnut-crusted lamb

34:06.870 --> 34:09.140
with a chive
and cilantro couscous.

34:09.140 --> 34:10.610
Freakin' delicious.

34:10.610 --> 34:12.940
This couscous went
ten miles down the road,

34:12.950 --> 34:15.350
<i>it got into three bar fights,
it came back full of dirt,</i>

34:15.350 --> 34:17.320
you brushed it off,
and somehow it's delicious.

34:17.320 --> 34:19.790
And the lamb itself...

34:19.790 --> 34:22.990
Is this happening?
Is this really happening?

34:22.990 --> 34:25.760
- You should be proud of yourself. Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.090
[Cliff]
Cheyenne, come on down.

34:27.090 --> 34:28.730
[Cheyenne] There you go.

34:28.730 --> 34:32.630
We have a pine-nut-crusted
lamb with couscous

34:32.630 --> 34:35.770
and roasted Brussels sprouts
with hints of rosemary and ginger.

34:35.770 --> 34:37.900
[Cliff] Temperature of
the lamb is spot-on.

34:37.910 --> 34:40.640
The sauce is really delicious.
I want more of it.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.540
It's a little thin.

34:42.540 --> 34:45.980
The Brussels are undercooked,
and the couscous itself is cooked well,

34:45.980 --> 34:49.950
- just the flavor profiles that you chose are off.
- Okay.

34:49.950 --> 34:52.950
You should know how
extremely proud I am of you...

34:52.950 --> 34:55.790
- [exclaims] - ...for getting
everything on a plate,

34:55.790 --> 34:57.820
and for digging deep
and finishing.

34:57.830 --> 35:01.230
I want to be here so bad,
so I was not giving up.

35:01.230 --> 35:03.900
- There was no way.
- And that's why there is a complete plate of food here.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.300
Yeah.

35:07.970 --> 35:11.240
My Rocking Red Stars.
Al, you're up first.

35:11.240 --> 35:14.410
My couscous has onions,
Brussels sprouts...

35:14.410 --> 35:15.910
What's the crust on your lamb?

35:15.910 --> 35:18.280
I liked that "harisso" sauce
so much...

35:18.280 --> 35:19.910
- Harissa. Right.
- I used that.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.850
[Anne] You did a very nice
job butchering your lamb.

35:22.850 --> 35:25.050
The temperature that your lamb
is cooked to is great.

35:25.050 --> 35:28.690
- Okay.
- Your couscous, the raw onions in here,

35:28.690 --> 35:30.360
you know a little bit better
than that.

35:30.360 --> 35:33.160
Overall, I needed to see
a higher gear.

35:33.160 --> 35:34.960
- Okay?
- Yes, Chef.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.130
All right, Angie, come on up.

35:36.130 --> 35:39.260
- Hello, Chef Anne.
- So, what flavors did you use today?

35:39.270 --> 35:41.800
Garlic, onions,
ginger, soy sauce,

35:41.800 --> 35:43.900
shallot and chives.

35:43.900 --> 35:47.440
You did a nice job searing.
The flavor of your sauce is nice.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.670
The knife cuts look
a little bit chunky,

35:49.680 --> 35:52.540
maybe because they're just
not cooked quite down enough.

35:52.550 --> 35:56.980
Your couscous might be a hair
on the salty side, but very good job.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.180
- All right, Marti.
- Okay.

35:59.190 --> 36:00.820
[chuckles nervously]

36:00.820 --> 36:02.920
<i>I hope that when Chef Anne
looks at my dish</i>

36:02.920 --> 36:07.090
she sees Christmas,
Santa Claus, and sleigh bells.

36:07.090 --> 36:10.100
The crust has pine nuts,
mint, tarragon,

36:10.100 --> 36:16.100
and then the couscous has
apricot, raisin, date, fennel, onion...

36:16.100 --> 36:18.800
- Your sauce cooked down a little too much.
- Yeah.

36:18.810 --> 36:21.640
- It was a little...
- And there's a lot of it.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.310
But does it taste good? No?

36:24.310 --> 36:27.780
I am slaughtered.
I am taken out to pasture.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.950
<i>I have been sheared.</i>

36:29.950 --> 36:33.850
Oh, Mary, come and get your
little lamb, 'cause she is done.

36:33.850 --> 36:35.520
[sheep bleats]

36:40.330 --> 36:43.030
But does it taste good? No?

36:43.030 --> 36:44.960
- Salty!
- Okay.

36:44.970 --> 36:48.200
It's pretty salty. I will say your
lamb is seasoned really nicely.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.170
Oh! Praise God in Heaven.

36:50.170 --> 36:52.140
Your couscous is really nice,

36:52.140 --> 36:55.910
but the onions and fennel feel
a little bit on the "cronché" side.

36:55.910 --> 36:57.340
- What is that?
- Crunchy.

36:57.340 --> 37:00.050
<i>- Oui, oui. Okay. Thank you.
- Very good. Thanks.</i>

37:00.050 --> 37:02.150
Kara, come on up.

37:02.150 --> 37:05.750
- Ooh, I got the "hungry man" portion, huh?
- Yeah. [all laugh]

37:05.750 --> 37:09.750
My couscous is inspired by
Thanksgiving at my house.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.820
I'm not allowed to cook
at Thanksgiving at all, so...

37:12.830 --> 37:16.630
It has raisins, cranberries,
corn, rosemary,

37:16.630 --> 37:19.860
and my crust has cashews.

37:19.870 --> 37:22.200
[Anne] I think your lamb could
be seasoned a little bit more.

37:22.200 --> 37:23.940
I don't feel like
I'm getting the cashews.

37:23.940 --> 37:27.040
It's cooked a little bit over,

37:27.040 --> 37:31.140
but you did the best job of the
bunch butchering your lamb today.

37:31.140 --> 37:32.980
I knew I was a good butcher-ess.

37:32.980 --> 37:34.650
- Here you go. Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef Anne.

37:34.650 --> 37:36.650
All right, Hilda,
come on up here.

37:36.650 --> 37:40.650
I made lamb chops
with mustard and almonds.

37:40.650 --> 37:44.960
With the couscous, I have
cauliflower, lemon zest, and raisins.

37:44.960 --> 37:48.060
[Anne] I really like
the lemon in your couscous.

37:48.060 --> 37:52.130
Knife cuts on your florets
look just the right size,

37:52.130 --> 37:55.100
but they needed to be roasted
lots more.

37:55.100 --> 37:59.100
Your rack of lamb, the crust could have
been in the oven for a little bit longer,

37:59.110 --> 38:01.270
- but really nice flavor.
- Thank you, Chef.

38:03.780 --> 38:07.050
Welcome back.
You guys have almost made it

38:07.050 --> 38:09.480
through another week
in Boot Camp.

38:09.480 --> 38:12.080
This week,
flavor was at the forefront,

38:12.090 --> 38:16.120
and while some of you have
taste buds bursting with potential,

38:16.120 --> 38:17.560
others fell flat.

38:17.560 --> 38:19.620
[balloon deflates]

38:19.630 --> 38:21.790
Let's start with the good news.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.700
My Rocking Red Stars,
you are all safe this week.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.130
- Hooray!
- [all cheer]

38:27.130 --> 38:29.800
But there was
one Rocking Red Star

38:29.800 --> 38:33.910
who was just a little bit
extra sparkly this week.

38:33.910 --> 38:36.510
The recruit that is the winner
on the Rocking Red Stars is...

38:39.750 --> 38:41.080
- Angie.
- Oh, yes!

38:41.080 --> 38:43.280
- And you win $1,000.
- Yes, thank you.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.650
Thank you so much.

38:44.650 --> 38:45.850
Ching-ching.

38:45.850 --> 38:48.590
And on the Blue Team,
there was one recruit

38:48.590 --> 38:51.190
whose lamb was pure perfection.

38:51.190 --> 38:54.290
The winner of this week's
Main Dish challenge is...

38:57.860 --> 38:59.300
- Eddie.
- [cheering]

39:00.130 --> 39:02.000
- Thank you.
- [squeals]

39:02.000 --> 39:02.770
Wow.

39:02.770 --> 39:06.970
Yes! I did it.
Finally, I did it.

39:06.970 --> 39:10.080
We're gonna party tonight.
Angie, drinks are on you.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.880
Also safe on the Blue Team
this week is...

39:12.880 --> 39:14.350
Melody.

39:14.350 --> 39:16.050
- Bianca.
- Thank you, Chef.

39:16.050 --> 39:18.880
Unfortunately, that means,
Peachez and Cheyenne,

39:18.890 --> 39:21.220
you are both at the bottom.
Please step forward.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.860
This was a really,
really difficult decision --

39:24.860 --> 39:27.060
Actually, the hardest one yet.

39:27.060 --> 39:31.130
The recruit that will not be
moving forward in Boot Camp is...

39:35.030 --> 39:36.970
Cheyenne.

39:38.940 --> 39:40.740
<i>[Cheyenne] I'm disappointed
in myself.</i>

39:40.740 --> 39:42.840
<i>I'm upset that I burned my hand.</i>

39:42.840 --> 39:45.210
I'm wishing I had
more time in Boot Camp.

39:45.210 --> 39:47.310
[Cliff] Unfortunately,
I'm gonna need that apron.

39:47.310 --> 39:50.010
Here you go. Thank you.

39:50.020 --> 39:52.920
This experience
has been amazing,

39:52.920 --> 39:55.490
<i>and I wanted to continue
my journey.</i>

39:55.490 --> 39:58.620
-Great job. We've loved having you here.
-Thank you for having me.

39:58.630 --> 40:01.230
Chey, I'm gonna miss you.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.900
Can I say something?
I got really emotional

40:08.900 --> 40:10.770
when she gave her speech today.

40:10.770 --> 40:13.000
Cheyenne really wanted
to be here.

40:13.010 --> 40:15.070
We all want to be here,

40:15.080 --> 40:17.880
but I think that she wants it
a little bit more than I.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.880
- It's okay.
- No, no, no.

40:19.880 --> 40:21.380
So I can't let her go.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.110
She should stay,
and I should go.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.550
[viewers gasp]

40:24.550 --> 40:27.020
- [Cliff] Are you sure?
- Oh, I'm absolutely positive.

40:27.020 --> 40:28.250
- No.
- Yes.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.090
- I mean, this makes me cry.
- [Cliff] Man.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.020
<i>[Cheyenne] I'm in shock.</i>

40:33.030 --> 40:36.460
This is a chance at $25,000,

40:36.460 --> 40:40.930
<i>and she literally
just handed me her chance.</i>

40:40.930 --> 40:44.900
I can't believe anybody would
be so kind, to do that for me.

40:44.910 --> 40:47.040
[cheering]

40:47.040 --> 40:50.540
-Are you sure?
-Win that money. Win the money.

40:50.540 --> 40:52.880
I've learned a lot
since I've been here.

40:52.880 --> 40:56.950
I'm really excited
to go home and cut onions

40:56.950 --> 40:58.420
<i>and work on my mise en place.</i>

40:58.420 --> 41:01.920
Now, I'm not gonna pretend I'm not
gonna continue to have my meals catered,

41:01.920 --> 41:05.790
but I will be cooking
just a little bit.

41:05.790 --> 41:07.360
[tearful] Bye, guys.

41:09.230 --> 41:13.330
Oh, my goodness, what an
emotional day across the board.

41:13.330 --> 41:15.900
[Cliff] Cheyenne,
I am more than happy

41:15.900 --> 41:17.940
- to welcome you back to the Blue Team.
- Thank you.

41:17.940 --> 41:20.910
- How are you feeling?
- Honest to God, I'm in shock.

41:20.910 --> 41:24.010
That was the kindest thing
anybody has ever done for me.

41:24.010 --> 41:26.910
There are no words that
could express my gratitude.

41:26.910 --> 41:28.780
- Do it justice.
- I will.

41:28.780 --> 41:29.950
- I know you will.
- [Anne] Wow.

41:29.950 --> 41:33.790
Who knew lamb chops could
make people so emotional?

41:33.790 --> 41:36.550
[narrator] Next time
<i>on Worst Cooks In America...</i>

41:36.560 --> 41:39.190
<i>[Anne] We are heading
down the rabbit-hole</i>

41:39.190 --> 41:41.990
<i>to the world of pastries.</i>

41:42.000 --> 41:43.930
- Oh! It's a donut!
- Let's go, Red Team.

41:43.930 --> 41:46.200
We were scratching our heads like
we're Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.730
<i>We could not figure this out.</i>

41:47.730 --> 41:50.200
<i>[Anne] We will be making
fruit tarts.</i>

41:50.200 --> 41:51.700
- Whoa!
- [contestant] It's so pretty.

41:51.710 --> 41:54.070
I'm trying to figure out
a nice way

41:54.070 --> 41:55.970
<i>to get the tart out
without breaking it.</i>

41:55.980 --> 41:57.340
Oh.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.210
Eddie, what did you do?
