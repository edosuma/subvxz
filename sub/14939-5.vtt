Where you going?

00:31.800 --> 00:34.041
Did you hear that?

00:34.075 --> 00:36.083
Nice try,
I don't scare that easy.

00:36.117 --> 00:39.121
Yeah.

00:43.997 --> 00:45.598
Agh!
Hold me.

00:45.632 --> 00:47.267
Mm.

00:51.638 --> 00:52.939
You okay?

00:56.509 --> 00:57.942
Oh, my God.

no, an international--
international, agreed.

01:42.561 --> 01:43.928
Yes, international,
absolutely.

01:43.963 --> 01:45.630
Anything to taste that good.

01:45.665 --> 01:49.367
Whoa.
Yeah, wow.

01:49.401 --> 01:52.470
It's my friend's place,
but she's letting me stay here.

01:52.504 --> 01:55.775
You know...
I still can't understand

01:55.809 --> 01:57.610
how you managed
to figure out the recipes

01:57.644 --> 02:00.915
to everything we just had
simply by tasting them.

02:00.949 --> 02:04.686
I mean, that's incredible.
I, uh...

02:04.721 --> 02:08.223
I have a super sensitive palate.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.959
Well, I was thinking that...

02:09.994 --> 02:11.261
Maybe we could--

02:11.295 --> 02:13.030
before you get your
own show on the Food Network--

02:13.064 --> 02:15.066
We could, um...

02:15.100 --> 02:16.434
I don't know,
whip something up.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.504
Just you and me.

02:18.538 --> 02:21.541
- Whip something up?
- Yeah.

02:37.927 --> 02:39.594
Oh, my God!

02:39.628 --> 02:41.696
I'm sorry if I--
did I do something?

02:41.730 --> 02:43.098
No.

02:43.132 --> 02:44.732
I need you to go.
Yeah, yeah.

02:44.767 --> 02:46.067
Could you
please just leave now?

02:46.101 --> 02:47.201
- You okay?
- Please!

02:47.236 --> 02:48.569
No, don't touch me, please.

02:48.603 --> 02:49.770
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I didn't--

02:49.805 --> 02:51.906
I'm sorry, Sam.

02:51.940 --> 02:55.076
- Please go.
- Okay, yeah.

02:57.580 --> 02:59.281
- Rachel...
- For the 50th time,

02:59.316 --> 03:00.983
Nina, I'm not gonna talk
about my date with Sam.

03:01.018 --> 03:03.487
Fine, but if you
suddenly decide to spill,

03:03.521 --> 03:05.623
just remember
I have plans tonight.

03:05.657 --> 03:07.759
- I won't spill.
- Rach...

03:07.793 --> 03:10.929
Morning, everyone.
I come bearing gifts.

03:10.963 --> 03:13.298
- Oh! Let me open it.
- All right.

03:13.332 --> 03:15.700
- Let me open it, please.
- No, I want to--

03:15.735 --> 03:18.336
oh, yeah,
let me open it, please.

03:18.371 --> 03:21.673
The sound of red tape being
cut, courtesy of Agent Sullivan.

03:21.707 --> 03:24.809
- Oh, it's badges!
- That's official cover, right?

03:24.843 --> 03:26.144
Nail on the head, Cameron.

03:26.178 --> 03:28.246
I get to keep this one,
it's my photo.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.580
Apparently we all get one.

03:29.615 --> 03:31.949
Now we
both have badges, Bill.

03:31.984 --> 03:34.018
- DCIS?
- It's a real agency.

03:34.053 --> 03:36.989
Agent Sullivan
said this is gonna help us

03:37.023 --> 03:38.991
with our
"investigatory hurdles."

03:39.025 --> 03:41.728
I thought I was the answer
to our "investigatory hurdles."

03:41.762 --> 03:43.730
Eh, here's yours, Bill.

03:43.764 --> 03:45.532
What does
"DCIS" even stand for?

03:45.566 --> 03:46.867
It says.

03:46.901 --> 03:48.969
It's "Defense Criminal
Investigative Service."

03:49.003 --> 03:51.171
Yeah.
Still no idea.

03:53.208 --> 03:55.943
- Hello, this is Sahra Pirzad--
- Rachel.

03:55.978 --> 03:58.312
Oh, sorry.
I'm interrupting.

03:58.346 --> 04:02.316
No, no, it's fine.
Please, come in.

04:02.351 --> 04:05.086
Was that that Sam fellow?

04:05.120 --> 04:07.555
Does everybody here
know everything about my life?

04:07.589 --> 04:10.491
It's an office, Rachel,
that's what happens.

04:10.526 --> 04:13.561
You know, people watch out
for each other, and...

04:13.595 --> 04:15.797
And a first date
is quite a milestone--

04:15.831 --> 04:17.231
- Okay.
- In a young woman's life.

04:17.266 --> 04:18.933
Please.

04:18.968 --> 04:21.303
Dr. Rosen, I'm not
gonna talk about this.

04:21.338 --> 04:23.472
Not with Nina,
and certainly not with you.

04:23.506 --> 04:25.141
All right,
if you change your mind...

04:25.175 --> 04:26.509
- Thank you.
- I'm here.

04:26.543 --> 04:28.077
I will let you know.

04:28.112 --> 04:29.846
How would you like
to go on a little road trip?

04:29.881 --> 04:32.349
- To where?
- Fenton, Pennsylvania.

04:32.383 --> 04:34.484
Agent Sullivan
called about a situation there

04:34.519 --> 04:37.521
and I think your abilities
might come in handy.

04:40.225 --> 04:43.827
According to Sullivan, Fenton's
been hit by a rash of deaths.

04:43.861 --> 04:46.129
Three so far.

04:46.164 --> 04:49.266
The victims suffered
rapid onset organ failure.

04:49.300 --> 04:52.903
The CDC found abnormalities
in the victim's brains,

04:52.937 --> 04:55.573
but no pathogens
that could've caused them.

04:55.607 --> 04:59.878
Of course, the CDC
doesn't know about Alphas.

04:59.912 --> 05:01.579
Now it's our turn.

05:05.985 --> 05:07.486
I would've have guessed

05:07.520 --> 05:11.191
we'd need to employ
our new cover so quickly.

05:11.225 --> 05:12.859
I don't know.

05:12.894 --> 05:14.528
I think I liked it better when
we were seeking out

05:14.562 --> 05:16.664
math experts
and violin prodigies.

05:16.698 --> 05:18.399
I know, it's a bit
of an adjustment.

05:18.434 --> 05:19.600
Adjustment?

05:19.634 --> 05:21.702
Well, our mandate is
changing, Rachel.

05:21.736 --> 05:25.172
You know the saying,
the reward for success is...

05:25.207 --> 05:26.907
Well, we shouldn't
get ahead of ourselves.

05:26.942 --> 05:29.977
You know, we don't even know if
we're dealing with an Alpha yet.

05:30.011 --> 05:32.646
And that's why I need
my best forensic investigator.

05:43.024 --> 05:44.892
I smell fear.

05:44.926 --> 05:47.061
Whatever's happening here...

05:47.095 --> 05:50.097
This whole town
is scared to death.

05:54.946 --> 05:56.865
Yeah.
He said it's right up here.

06:02.270 --> 06:04.905
It's radiation from
that nuclear plant upriver.

06:04.939 --> 06:07.708
I read an article
about electromagnetic fields

06:07.742 --> 06:09.576
caused by power lines.

06:09.610 --> 06:11.277
Cancer clusters.

06:11.311 --> 06:13.746
- Terrified.
- Hm?

06:13.781 --> 06:15.548
- Just like the others.
- Seem to have a bit of

06:15.582 --> 06:17.383
a chicken or the egg
thing going here.

06:17.417 --> 06:18.784
Dr. Rosen?
Yes.

06:18.818 --> 06:20.753
- Yes, Miss Pirzad?
- Pirzad, yes.

06:20.787 --> 06:23.356
- I'm Dr. Calder, CDC.
- I was under the impression

06:23.390 --> 06:25.625
that the CDC had
already ruled on this case.

06:25.660 --> 06:27.761
Yeah, we're just
pulling up stakes as we speak.

06:27.795 --> 06:30.163
But when I heard they
were sending in the DCIS,

06:30.198 --> 06:32.933
I thought that I might
do the hand-off myself.

06:32.967 --> 06:34.802
Oh, that's
very considerate of you.

06:34.836 --> 06:35.936
Now I've read your reports,

06:35.970 --> 06:37.338
are there
any further developments?

06:37.372 --> 06:39.039
With all three victims,

06:39.073 --> 06:41.207
the damage was centered
in their amygdalas.

06:41.242 --> 06:42.976
- The...?
- The structures in the brain

06:43.010 --> 06:44.477
that process fear and stress.

06:44.511 --> 06:46.913
It's as if they
were subjected to a sudden

06:46.947 --> 06:48.781
and really severe shock.
Are these people afraid

06:48.815 --> 06:50.216
because
their neighbors are dying

06:50.250 --> 06:51.816
or is it the fear
that's killing them?

06:51.851 --> 06:53.518
It's the chicken or egg, hm?

06:53.553 --> 06:56.721
Good luck.

06:56.755 --> 06:58.322
Three people are dead.

06:58.357 --> 06:59.958
We need answers!

06:59.992 --> 07:01.593
How is my team supposed
to focus

07:01.628 --> 07:03.795
when all they can think about
is who's gonna drop next?

07:03.830 --> 07:06.097
You've gotta calm down.
I've told you everything I know.

07:06.131 --> 07:07.398
You haven't
told me a damn thing!

07:07.433 --> 07:09.835
Look, I swear, Marty,
if you are holding out on me--

07:09.869 --> 07:12.871
Don't threaten me.

07:17.678 --> 07:19.812
That was
a lot of testosterone.

07:19.846 --> 07:21.013
Sheriff Handell?

07:21.048 --> 07:23.416
Hi, I'm Dr. Lee Rosen...

07:23.450 --> 07:24.717
Rachel Pirzad.

07:24.751 --> 07:27.420
Marty.
Sorry about that.

07:27.454 --> 07:29.622
Coach Zelanski
gets a little passionate

07:29.656 --> 07:31.457
about his football team.
"Passionate?"

07:31.492 --> 07:32.758
I heard they were
sending more people,

07:32.793 --> 07:34.794
so exactly who are you folks?

07:38.965 --> 07:41.601
- Oh, sorry.
- DCIS.

07:41.635 --> 07:44.471
Come on back.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.439
How'd this end up
at Defense Department?

07:46.474 --> 07:47.908
Are we looking at terrorism?

07:47.942 --> 07:50.711
I wouldn't jump
to any conclusions just yet.

07:50.746 --> 07:53.147
Sheriff, I'm sorry,

07:53.182 --> 07:55.516
were there any
links between the victims?

07:55.551 --> 07:58.820
Ned Burton died first.
He was David Burton's dad.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.756
Oh, David is
the local football star.

08:01.790 --> 08:03.024
Ned was a realtor.

08:03.058 --> 08:04.759
Watts was our bank manager.

08:04.793 --> 08:08.362
James Howard a guidance
counselor at Fenton high.

08:08.397 --> 08:11.165
These bodies
looked half melted inside.

08:11.199 --> 08:14.234
But there was no infection,
nothing on tox screens...

08:14.269 --> 08:15.869
Tell me what I'm missing.

08:15.904 --> 08:19.072
I mean, four deaths in four
weeks is way outta my league.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.641
Did you say four deaths?

08:20.675 --> 08:22.643
We were only
informed about three.

08:22.677 --> 08:25.479
Yeah, the fourth
was unrelated.

08:25.514 --> 08:26.748
Just a freak accident.

08:26.782 --> 08:29.084
What kind of freak accident?

08:29.118 --> 08:30.352
Car crash.

08:30.386 --> 08:32.386
Chris Elkhart
slammed into a telephone pole

08:32.422 --> 08:33.688
on his way home from school.

08:33.724 --> 08:36.626
It was a horrible tragedy.
Autopsy?

08:36.659 --> 08:39.296
In a small town like this
when a kid hits a pole,

08:39.330 --> 08:40.730
it's probably drugs or alcohol.

08:40.764 --> 08:42.832
But why put
the family through that?

08:42.866 --> 08:45.635
Besides, this had nothing to do
with the other deaths.

08:45.669 --> 08:48.605
We probably have to see
the body in order to be certain.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.409
I assume we'll need
a court order to exhume?

08:51.443 --> 08:53.211
Chris' mother's
been through hell.

08:53.245 --> 08:55.813
I promise we'll be
as considerate as possible.

08:55.847 --> 08:58.215
Exhume Chris?

08:58.249 --> 09:00.250
Uh, I don't understand.

09:00.285 --> 09:02.886
I'm a father, Mrs. Elkhart.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.956
But I can only
begin to imagine your pain.

09:05.990 --> 09:08.759
But...

09:08.793 --> 09:12.162
Given the circumstances
of Chris' accident,

09:12.197 --> 09:14.465
we've asked Sheriff Handell

09:14.499 --> 09:19.003
to help us look into things
a little further.

09:19.037 --> 09:20.604
Isn't that right, Rachel?

09:20.639 --> 09:23.140
I'm sorry, Mrs. Elkhart.

09:23.174 --> 09:24.708
How long was it
just the two of you?

09:24.743 --> 09:27.878
Chris was 12
when his father passed.

09:27.913 --> 09:29.113
Cancer.

09:29.147 --> 09:31.848
Mm. That must've
been a difficult time.

09:31.882 --> 09:33.817
Chris helped me
get through it.

09:33.851 --> 09:36.619
I know most teenagers don't

09:36.654 --> 09:39.688
wanna hang out
with their mother, but...

09:39.723 --> 09:42.792
Chris always told me
that I was his best friend.

09:42.827 --> 09:46.496
He always called us
"The dynamic duo."

09:46.531 --> 09:49.700
I'm sorry
I have to ask this.

09:49.734 --> 09:53.837
But around the time of the
accident, was there anything

09:53.871 --> 09:57.207
out of the ordinary
happening in Chris' life?

09:57.241 --> 09:59.209
Was he exhibiting
any odd behavior?

09:59.244 --> 10:01.645
Chris tried out for
the football team this year.

10:01.680 --> 10:05.049
It's a religion around here.

10:05.083 --> 10:06.484
But he wasn't big enough,

10:06.518 --> 10:10.121
so Coach Zelanski
made him equipment manager.

10:10.156 --> 10:11.756
We ran into the coach earlier.

10:11.791 --> 10:15.828
He was very, uh, passionate.

10:15.862 --> 10:17.329
He's a thug.

10:17.364 --> 10:21.167
He used to get on Chris
for everything.

10:21.201 --> 10:23.903
He would shout at him to

10:23.937 --> 10:27.273
move faster,
do it better.

10:27.307 --> 10:28.574
I told him to quit,

10:28.608 --> 10:31.510
but he didn't want
to let the team down.

10:31.545 --> 10:34.246
They all showed up
for his funeral, though.

10:34.281 --> 10:36.148
Players and coaches.

10:36.183 --> 10:37.850
That must've
been very comforting.

10:37.884 --> 10:39.418
Chris would've liked it.

10:39.452 --> 10:41.621
He was finally one of them.

10:41.655 --> 10:44.524
I'm--I am so sorry.

10:44.558 --> 10:49.963
This is so unprofessional.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.465
Chris...

10:51.499 --> 10:54.569
Chris was so lucky to have
such a loving mother like you.

10:54.603 --> 10:59.774
Aw, that is so sweet
of you to say.

10:59.809 --> 11:02.143
Eh...

11:02.177 --> 11:03.645
All right, um...

11:03.679 --> 11:07.214
If you think
exhuming his body would help.

11:07.249 --> 11:10.250
But could we please
get this over quickly?

11:13.154 --> 11:16.889
Rachel, are you
all right with this?

11:16.924 --> 11:18.624
I need you
to be honest with me...

11:18.659 --> 11:20.426
I know I lost it
in there, Dr. Rosen.

11:20.461 --> 11:21.794
I will not
let that happen again.

11:21.829 --> 11:25.132
But it will.
And that's okay.

11:25.166 --> 11:29.003
You know, I'm glad
we have this chance to talk.

11:29.038 --> 11:31.472
Because you've been
feeling pretty sensitive

11:31.507 --> 11:35.911
since you've moved out of
your parents' home, haven't you?

11:35.945 --> 11:38.614
My mom won't even
return my calls, Dr. Rosen.

11:38.648 --> 11:41.217
And I miss her.

11:41.251 --> 11:44.086
So seeing
what a loving relationship

11:44.120 --> 11:47.222
Mrs. Elkhart had with her son
has probably made you feel--

11:47.257 --> 11:50.425
It hurt.
Look, I just--

11:50.460 --> 11:52.828
I just wanna find out
whoever did this to her, okay?

11:52.862 --> 11:54.596
Whoever took
her child away from her.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.165
Mm-hmm.

11:56.199 --> 11:57.967
That coach seems like
a real nightmare.

11:58.001 --> 11:59.435
Fear and stress,
right, Dr. Rosen?

11:59.469 --> 12:02.338
Yes, well, we need
to find out everything we can

12:02.372 --> 12:04.740
before we confront anybody.
Of course.

12:04.774 --> 12:06.675
But, yes,
that sheriff was not

12:06.710 --> 12:09.712
a very big fan
of Coach Zelanski's.

12:20.557 --> 12:23.960
Sheriff?

12:23.995 --> 12:25.729
Eh, this is odd.

12:25.764 --> 12:29.700
Is anybody here?

12:43.047 --> 12:44.914
I smell decay.

12:54.824 --> 12:59.895
One heartbeat.
Back there.

12:59.929 --> 13:02.931
Rachel.

13:27.860 --> 13:29.193
Sheriff Handell?

13:45.245 --> 13:48.248
Sheriff Handell?

13:55.791 --> 13:59.294
The smell, it's everywhere.

14:03.332 --> 14:05.533
Rachel, wait.

14:05.567 --> 14:06.534
Agh!

14:06.568 --> 14:08.870
Dr. Rosen!
Help!

14:08.904 --> 14:11.172
Agh! Ugh!

14:11.206 --> 14:15.676
Agh! Agh!

14:15.710 --> 14:16.810
Are you all right?

14:16.844 --> 14:19.212
I don't know!

14:19.247 --> 14:22.116
Sheriff?
Can you hear me?

14:22.150 --> 14:23.384
I should've listened.

14:23.418 --> 14:24.786
Who did this to you?

14:24.821 --> 14:27.555
Should've stopped it.

14:42.995 --> 14:46.097
Please, just call me back.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.048
Is Rachel joining us?

14:49.049 --> 14:51.150
I told her her food
was getting cold, but...

14:51.184 --> 14:52.985
Well, if she
feels anything like I do,

14:53.020 --> 14:54.621
I imagine
she's quite rattled.

14:54.655 --> 14:57.724
I'm just gonna have
to take one for the team.

14:57.759 --> 14:59.393
Would you like to pay,
Bill?

14:59.427 --> 15:03.164
Eggs, cheese,
bacon, pancakes...

15:03.198 --> 15:05.700
You sure these folks didn't
just die of heart failure?

15:05.734 --> 15:07.769
Heart failure.
Because of the food.

15:07.804 --> 15:09.438
Maybe they
were just bored to death.

15:09.472 --> 15:10.773
Hey, I grew up
in a town like this.

15:10.807 --> 15:11.907
Of course you did.

15:11.941 --> 15:13.208
Explains your name, Hicks.

15:13.243 --> 15:15.577
What were you?
The star quarterback?

15:15.611 --> 15:17.112
No, star pitcher, right?

15:17.146 --> 15:18.547
What can I say,
I peaked early.

15:18.581 --> 15:19.948
Well,
I can say with confidence

15:19.983 --> 15:23.552
that none of these people
died from boredom or poor diet.

15:23.586 --> 15:26.021
Cortisol levels
in Sheriff Handell's blood

15:26.055 --> 15:27.856
were five times higher
than I've ever seen.

15:27.891 --> 15:32.928
Mm, cortisol.
Makes sense.

15:32.962 --> 15:34.396
Come on,
what's cortisol, Doc?

15:34.430 --> 15:37.032
It's a hormone produced
when the body undergoes stress.

15:37.066 --> 15:40.369
At chronically elevated levels,
it can shrink the amygdalas

15:40.403 --> 15:42.704
and even eat away at
muscles and organs.

15:42.739 --> 15:45.674
Now imagine that on
a radically amplified scale.

15:45.708 --> 15:47.008
Can I get you anything else?

15:47.043 --> 15:49.444
DCIS, you don't ask questions,
we ask questions.

15:49.478 --> 15:51.446
- Gary.
- We ask and you tell.

15:51.481 --> 15:52.747
Gary, that's impolite.

15:52.782 --> 15:54.950
So you really are Feds.

15:54.984 --> 15:56.451
- Put it away.
- I knew it.

15:56.486 --> 15:59.722
It's a serial killer,
isn't it?

15:59.756 --> 16:01.624
You tell us.
Respect the badge.

16:01.658 --> 16:02.825
- Gary.
- Gary.

16:02.859 --> 16:04.760
- Bill is laughing.
- What else could it be?

16:04.795 --> 16:06.628
I mean, I know
they didn't find poison,

16:06.663 --> 16:09.431
but there is
untraceable poisons, right?

16:09.466 --> 16:12.768
Or maybe it's
something in the water?

16:12.802 --> 16:15.404
Ma'am, I promise you,
we're looking into anything

16:15.438 --> 16:18.707
and everything related
to these--to these victims.

16:18.741 --> 16:20.309
And when we find out
what caused this,

16:20.343 --> 16:25.581
we'll let everyone know.
Okay.

16:25.615 --> 16:27.749
All right.

16:27.784 --> 16:31.854
Meet Coach Kent Zelanski.

16:31.889 --> 16:33.823
Grease.

16:33.857 --> 16:35.891
Thank you, Gary.

16:35.926 --> 16:37.927
So he's connected
to four of our victims.

16:37.962 --> 16:40.429
The guidance counselor,
the football player's father,

16:40.464 --> 16:42.732
and Chris Elkhart.
And Rachel and I saw him

16:42.766 --> 16:44.567
in conflict with the sheriff.
Mm.

16:44.601 --> 16:47.103
I don't know what
our next step should be.

16:47.137 --> 16:49.105
Murder investigations
aren't exactly

16:49.139 --> 16:50.807
the cornerstone of
my practice.

16:50.841 --> 16:53.009
Well,
I'm sure you don't think

16:53.043 --> 16:55.512
I just came here
for the vacation, right?

16:55.546 --> 16:59.148
I got you.
Thank you, Bill.

17:01.083 --> 17:04.752
So Nina and I will
start with Coach Zelanski

17:04.787 --> 17:06.355
I want the rest of you to
canvas the school

17:06.388 --> 17:08.089
be very, very careful.

17:08.124 --> 17:10.025
We don't know how
this Alpha is killing folks.

17:10.060 --> 17:11.627
If there is an Alpha.
Yeah, well,

17:11.661 --> 17:13.796
we still wanna
be on alert, people.

17:13.829 --> 17:16.098
"Can't believe
we still have cheer practice

17:16.133 --> 17:17.967
when people are dying."

17:18.002 --> 17:22.005
"Ms. Rue was all up in
my grill over that trig test."

17:22.039 --> 17:23.607
Up in my grill...
Try to concentrate

17:23.641 --> 17:25.040
the ones from
Coach Zelanski, okay?

17:25.076 --> 17:26.510
Yeah.
Whoo!

17:26.544 --> 17:29.479
My jacket doesn't have
leather sleeves.

17:29.514 --> 17:31.581
I want a patch on my jacket.
A "G."

17:31.616 --> 17:33.383
- Okay, I'm gonna get you a "G."
- For Gary.

17:33.417 --> 17:34.751
For Gary.
I'm gonna sew it on myself.

17:34.786 --> 17:36.086
You just focus for
a couple minutes, okay?

17:36.120 --> 17:38.422
Okay. Hey, Cameron,
you're up in my grill now.

17:38.456 --> 17:40.690
You gotta get out of my grill.
Okay.

17:40.724 --> 17:44.693
Coach Zelanski sends
mean emails.

17:44.728 --> 17:47.396
There's one to rich Wallace.

17:47.430 --> 17:48.530
And there's three--

17:48.565 --> 17:51.233
no, there's four to
David Burton.

17:51.268 --> 17:53.169
David Burton.
Burton.

17:53.203 --> 17:54.870
Isn't that the name
of one of our dead guys?

17:54.905 --> 17:57.907
DCIS, eyes to yourself.

18:01.946 --> 18:03.881
What does my relationship
with Ned Burton

18:03.916 --> 18:05.550
have to do with his death?
Like I said,

18:05.584 --> 18:08.186
we're just trying to get
a better sense of the victims.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.288
You think I don't see
where this is going?

18:10.323 --> 18:12.657
All right, you tell me.
Where's this going?

18:12.692 --> 18:14.559
You know, you better
be pretty sure of yourself

18:14.593 --> 18:16.327
before you come
into my school and accuse me

18:16.362 --> 18:17.562
of being a part of--
Listen, listen.

18:17.596 --> 18:21.232
Nobody is accusing
you of anything...Yet.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.233
Do you know
what I do for this town?

18:23.268 --> 18:26.636
In case you haven't noticed,
Panthers football is Fenton.

18:26.671 --> 18:29.439
My team gives people hope.
And you come in here

18:29.474 --> 18:31.208
insinuating I had something
to do with these deaths?

18:31.242 --> 18:32.976
I never insinuated anything.

18:33.010 --> 18:34.244
You are a damn liar.
You are--

18:34.278 --> 18:36.012
Just stop it.

18:36.047 --> 18:39.082
You need to sit down,
lose the attitude,

18:39.116 --> 18:40.651
and answer our questions.

18:40.685 --> 18:44.422
Right.
Right.

18:44.456 --> 18:47.392
I'll answer your questions.
What do you wanna know?

18:47.426 --> 18:50.395
I'd like to see
these fancy badges do that.

18:50.429 --> 18:52.730
Coach Zelanski is an ass.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.065
But he's definitely
not our Alpha.

18:54.099 --> 18:55.399
And you're certain
about that?

18:55.434 --> 18:57.701
I could be wrong.
Maybe it is the water.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.504
Oh, CDC's been
very clear about that.

19:00.538 --> 19:04.007
So assuming it is an Alpha.
Someone who's using

19:04.041 --> 19:06.342
fear and intimidation to
kill these people,

19:06.377 --> 19:07.743
have you come across anyone

19:07.778 --> 19:09.778
who fits that,
you know, that profile?

19:09.813 --> 19:12.648
There was one football player
that kept popping up

19:12.683 --> 19:15.050
in Handell's files
for fighting and vandalism.

19:15.085 --> 19:16.853
But also bullying.
He even bullied--

19:16.887 --> 19:19.589
Hold on, hold on.
Where's Gary?

19:19.624 --> 19:22.359
David Burton.
No one likes David Burton.

19:22.393 --> 19:24.061
Not the coach, not anyone.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.063
"He punched you."
"Yep."

19:26.098 --> 19:28.333
"Did you see
Burton freak'n out?"

19:28.367 --> 19:30.769
Freak'n.
F-r-e-a-k-n.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.037
That's not a word.

19:32.071 --> 19:35.339
"Guy's a psycho."

19:35.374 --> 19:38.375
"Doosh!"

19:38.410 --> 19:39.743
Doo--doosh.

19:39.777 --> 19:44.013
Get out of
my hallway, wuss.

19:44.048 --> 19:45.381
Oh, hey!

19:45.416 --> 19:46.549
You're Dave Burton.

19:46.584 --> 19:47.951
The killer scares people.

19:47.985 --> 19:48.952
You scare people.

19:48.986 --> 19:50.353
Killer?

19:50.387 --> 19:53.122
Since when are they letting
retards into the school?

19:53.157 --> 19:54.257
I'm not--
I'm not a re--

19:54.291 --> 19:55.724
hey, you shouldn't
use that word.

19:55.759 --> 19:58.127
I'm autistic.
You're a retard.

19:58.162 --> 20:00.029
You look
pretty retarded to me.

20:00.063 --> 20:01.731
32 on the car scale.

20:01.765 --> 20:02.732
You have bad breath.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.767
Yeah, Carly Wellin,
she said

20:04.801 --> 20:07.671
that she'd rather lick
a toilet seat than kiss you.

20:07.705 --> 20:10.340
It got 47 retweets.

20:10.375 --> 20:14.179
Hey! Don't touch me!
I don't like to be touched!

20:14.213 --> 20:17.215
Yeah? Well that's
really too bad for you, man.

20:25.289 --> 20:26.622
Hey, hey!

20:26.657 --> 20:28.557
Back off!

20:29.660 --> 20:31.761
Agh!

20:37.068 --> 20:40.604
Agh.

20:41.739 --> 20:46.043
Hey, leave
my players alone.

20:46.077 --> 20:48.245
That's David Burton,
the Alpha!

20:48.280 --> 20:49.747
Stop him!

20:49.781 --> 20:52.783
Let me borrow this.

20:56.254 --> 20:57.355
FBI, out the way,
out the way.

20:57.389 --> 20:58.356
Excuse me.
Out the way.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.861
Oh, jeez.

21:02.895 --> 21:05.196
Doc.

21:05.231 --> 21:08.132
Was just trying to
trip the kid, not kill him.

21:08.166 --> 21:12.069
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.340
I didn't mean to.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.708
Cameron,
you did not do this.

21:17.743 --> 21:21.378
He is not an Alpha.
He's another victim.

21:21.413 --> 21:23.547
But how?
Where's the Alpha who did it?

21:23.581 --> 21:26.083
There's a hospital
about 15 miles from here.

21:26.117 --> 21:28.685
Kathy, I need you
to secure an MRI suite.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.120
Based on the other victims,

21:30.154 --> 21:32.223
I'd say David was
attacked a few hours ago.

21:32.257 --> 21:35.026
His jacket's
getting caught on the door.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.494
It's too bulky,
you should take it off.

21:36.529 --> 21:37.629
- Gary...
- Let me wear it.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.098
Gary, back up.
You wanna pick the seat up?

21:39.132 --> 21:40.466
Gary, you're gonna get hurt.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.668
- The lever right there.
- It's stuck.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.737
I think our
being here has accelerated

21:44.771 --> 21:47.473
the killer's time tables.
I would appreciate some help.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.508
- Now.
- Thanks, we're on our way.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.842
Bill, Cameron,
I think you should

21:50.877 --> 21:52.744
stay here and keep looking.

21:52.778 --> 21:56.147
It might be a good idea to
retrace David's last few hours.

21:56.181 --> 21:57.615
Dr. Rosen,
I'd like to stay too.

21:57.649 --> 21:58.983
Okay.

21:59.017 --> 22:02.052
- Gary, get in.
- No, I have bruises in my hair.

22:04.188 --> 22:07.223
So David's mother's saying

22:07.258 --> 22:08.625
he left at
the same time as usual.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.427
Walked through
the neighborhood.

22:10.462 --> 22:12.697
No one at school saw anything
strange up until the fight.

22:12.731 --> 22:14.832
- We're coming up empty.
- Not so fast, kids.

22:14.866 --> 22:17.134
The exhumation on
Chris Elkhart is done.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.370
We got the whole deal.
The autopsy here,

22:19.405 --> 22:21.339
we got
the county medical records

22:21.374 --> 22:23.808
the accident reports,
the school files I requested.

22:23.843 --> 22:27.346
Now Rachel, you said that
in all the victims, the am--

22:27.380 --> 22:29.882
- amygdalas.
- Thank you, Dr. House.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.716
They shrunk
in all the vics, right?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.785
- Yeah.
- Well, that's not the case

22:33.819 --> 22:35.987
with Chris Elkhart.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.521
So it was just an accident.

22:37.556 --> 22:41.358
I don't know.
Accident report's not adding up.

22:41.392 --> 22:45.962
Hicks, that temporal spatial
whatever thing you do...

22:45.996 --> 22:48.364
That can come in handy.
I need you to come with me.

22:48.398 --> 22:49.398
It's nice to feel wanted.

22:49.433 --> 22:50.667
You know what,
you guys go ahead.

22:50.701 --> 22:52.168
I'm gonna talk to the mom.

22:58.676 --> 23:01.645
Gary, take that off.
It's not yours.

23:01.679 --> 23:04.681
No, it looks better on me.
I'm a baller.

23:04.715 --> 23:06.783
How do you
even know that word?

23:06.817 --> 23:10.120
- It's the right word.
- Nina, Nina.

23:10.154 --> 23:11.855
Same symptoms as
all the other victims.

23:11.889 --> 23:13.756
Cortisol levels
through the roof.

23:13.791 --> 23:15.458
And when we flushed
his system,

23:15.493 --> 23:17.728
his body continued to
produce cortisol

23:17.762 --> 23:19.129
as rapidly as
we could get rid of it.

23:19.164 --> 23:20.664
Well, maybe David is pushed

23:20.698 --> 23:23.000
and it just
keeps triggering him.

23:23.034 --> 23:25.369
Yeah, maybe Nina's the killer.

23:25.403 --> 23:26.737
Are you the killer, Nina?

23:26.771 --> 23:29.407
It would be a surprise.

23:29.441 --> 23:32.010
Because for the levels to remain
so high for so long,

23:32.044 --> 23:34.079
they would have to
be triggered continuously.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.381
These readings
are consistent with a dr--

23:36.416 --> 23:39.318
a drug addict.

23:40.921 --> 23:43.990
That's why his body is
producing so much cortisol.

23:44.025 --> 23:45.559
He's in withdrawal.

23:45.593 --> 23:47.160
Withdrawal.

23:47.195 --> 23:48.661
But what's he addicted to?

23:48.696 --> 23:50.430
There were
no foreign substances

23:50.464 --> 23:53.166
indicated in his blood.

23:53.200 --> 23:56.035
I think
he's addicted to a person.

23:56.070 --> 23:57.036
They all were.

23:57.071 --> 23:59.072
The patterns were
all the same.

23:59.106 --> 24:01.207
Addiction,
then withdrawal.

24:01.241 --> 24:04.543
Fatal withdrawal.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.879
He's not responsive to meds.
Just like all the others.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.447
I really feel we
need to quarantine this kid.

24:08.482 --> 24:10.883
It won't be necessary.
Whatever is making him sick

24:10.918 --> 24:13.219
is not contagious.
Dr. Calder, hello again.

24:13.254 --> 24:15.221
I asked the hospital if
they would call me

24:15.256 --> 24:17.858
if anyone else fell ill.
May I?

24:17.892 --> 24:19.860
We need to initiate
support therapy right away.

24:19.895 --> 24:21.762
Start a dilauded drip.

24:29.004 --> 24:30.638
What did you just do to him?

24:30.673 --> 24:31.906
I just took his hand.

24:31.941 --> 24:33.775
It seemed as though
he needed some contact.

24:33.809 --> 24:37.678
Let go.
Just for a moment.

24:39.614 --> 24:42.082
Okay.
Take hold again.

24:42.116 --> 24:43.550
But both hands.

24:43.584 --> 24:45.318
I don't get it.
Why is this helping?

24:45.352 --> 24:46.886
By holding his hand, Nina.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.288
She's giving him exactly
what he needs.

24:49.322 --> 24:52.825
It's a chemical secreted
by his own brain, oxytocin.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.327
It's often
called "The love hormone."

24:54.361 --> 24:55.895
It's critically important

24:55.929 --> 24:58.431
in bonding people
to the ones they love.

24:58.465 --> 25:01.334
And conversely, it causes
the very real pain

25:01.369 --> 25:03.003
people speak of when
separated.

25:03.037 --> 25:04.504
That's where
the cortisol comes in.

25:04.539 --> 25:05.573
Yes, we need
oxytocin right away.

25:05.607 --> 25:06.941
You got it.

25:06.975 --> 25:08.442
There's something
I think I can add to that.

25:08.477 --> 25:12.380
Will you help me?

25:12.414 --> 25:15.150
Nina, someone in David's life
has done this to him.

25:15.184 --> 25:18.721
A serial killer who formed
an unnaturally strong bond

25:18.755 --> 25:21.524
and then severed that bond.

25:21.558 --> 25:24.795
Our Alpha.

25:24.829 --> 25:26.629
He's flatlining.
Nina, hold tightly.

25:26.664 --> 25:31.467
Crashing here!

25:31.502 --> 25:33.135
Based on
the medical evidence,

25:33.170 --> 25:35.104
it doesn't look like
Chris was a murder victim.

25:35.138 --> 25:37.939
But my colleagues
are still looking into it,

25:37.974 --> 25:39.874
and we should have answers
for you very soon.

25:39.909 --> 25:41.042
But you had a suspect?

25:41.077 --> 25:43.812
David Burton.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.180
I read David's file.

25:45.214 --> 25:47.616
I know that he bullied Chris,
but now he's dying.

25:47.650 --> 25:50.586
Well, you'll excuse me
if I don't shed any tears.

25:50.620 --> 25:53.723
Not after what David
and his friends did to my son.

25:53.757 --> 25:54.891
What exactly did they do?

25:54.925 --> 25:56.359
Jessica,
we need to know everything.

25:56.393 --> 25:58.428
They thought he was weak

25:58.463 --> 26:00.398
because he couldn't
make the team.

26:00.432 --> 26:05.470
He didn't like the same music
they liked, stupid things.

26:05.504 --> 26:08.272
So they ridiculed him,

26:08.307 --> 26:10.775
spread rumors about him
on the Internet,

26:10.809 --> 26:13.277
beat him up.

26:13.311 --> 26:17.514
The worst part for Chris
was that he idolized those boys.

26:17.549 --> 26:21.051
He couldn't understand
why they had targeted him.

26:21.085 --> 26:23.520
I'm sorry for
dumping all this on you.

26:23.554 --> 26:25.188
You were very kind
to come here.

26:25.223 --> 26:27.423
When did you say your
friends were coming back?

26:27.458 --> 26:29.893
Oh, well,
they're at the accident scene.

26:29.927 --> 26:31.795
So half hour,
maybe 45 minutes.

26:31.830 --> 26:33.797
Oh.
You could wait here.

26:33.832 --> 26:35.633
I could make you a snack--

26:35.667 --> 26:38.570
sorry.
No, it's okay.

26:38.604 --> 26:41.974
It's a habit.
It's just a habit.

26:42.008 --> 26:45.310
I guess in some ways
you remind me of him.

26:46.813 --> 26:50.382
You're so sweet.
I won't keep you.

26:50.416 --> 26:53.685
No, it's okay.
I'd love to stay.

26:53.719 --> 26:57.788
- Really?
- Yeah, snack sounds good.

26:57.822 --> 26:59.490
This is the spot, huh?

26:59.524 --> 27:02.358
You know, I am fully literate
in accident reports, Hicks?

27:02.393 --> 27:03.726
Did you know that?

27:03.760 --> 27:06.095
Was it raining?
An oil slick or something?

27:06.129 --> 27:07.930
No, it was a clear day.

27:07.964 --> 27:11.099
Overcast,
so no sun in his eyes.

27:11.134 --> 27:14.002
Like today.

27:14.037 --> 27:16.371
- How fast was he going?
- Report said 65.

27:16.406 --> 27:19.107
But he had good brakes
and new tires, so.

27:19.142 --> 27:21.476
Plenty of
room to maneuver.

27:30.152 --> 27:33.154
I'd expect to see swerve marks
if it was an accident.

27:48.069 --> 27:51.438
What you got?

27:51.473 --> 27:52.974
This is no accident.

28:00.383 --> 28:02.051
Oxytocin seems to
be working.

28:02.085 --> 28:06.656
Your instincts may very well
have saved David's life.

28:06.690 --> 28:10.927
I still don't understand
the addiction to the oxytocin.

28:10.961 --> 28:13.363
I mean, does your team
have any idea what's causing it?

28:13.397 --> 28:17.533
Um, yes, we do.

28:21.038 --> 28:23.139
Okay.

28:23.173 --> 28:26.476
Just the glaring silence
of government work.

28:26.510 --> 28:30.947
Something you seem to
be familiar with.

28:30.981 --> 28:32.664
It's been a pleasure.

28:32.689 --> 28:33.889
Thank You.

28:34.552 --> 28:38.655
Need...To see...

28:38.689 --> 28:40.490
Need to see her.

28:40.524 --> 28:44.661
Tell her...I'm sorry.

28:44.695 --> 28:48.064
I did--I didn't mean to hurt...

28:48.099 --> 28:49.432
Who do you
need to see, David?

28:51.136 --> 28:55.105
Who didn't you mean to hurt?

28:55.140 --> 28:57.475
All right.

28:57.509 --> 29:00.043
Just let me know if
anything changes, please.

29:00.078 --> 29:05.149
Sure.

29:05.183 --> 29:06.550
Yes, Bill.

29:06.585 --> 29:08.352
Doc, I think
we have our Alpha.

29:08.386 --> 29:09.920
Who?
How?

29:09.954 --> 29:11.455
According to Hicks,

29:11.489 --> 29:13.524
Chris Elkhart did not
die in an accident.

29:13.558 --> 29:15.326
Look, he crashed on purpose,
Doc.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.794
The kid floored it
and drove right into a--

29:16.828 --> 29:18.829
I got this, okay?
This is what I do.

29:18.863 --> 29:20.297
- Put it on speaker.
- We matched the autopsy

29:20.331 --> 29:21.598
with the police report

29:21.633 --> 29:23.734
and the facts are
not matching the conclusions.

29:23.768 --> 29:26.103
I mean, this kid died
of a suicide.

29:26.137 --> 29:27.871
And why wasn't that
in the reports?

29:27.905 --> 29:29.506
No idea.
Handell covered it up.

29:29.540 --> 29:31.041
He covered up a lot of things.

29:31.075 --> 29:32.809
Like that football kid,
David Burton.

29:32.844 --> 29:35.245
Apparently, he'd been bullying
Chris something awful.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.613
And according to Chris' file,

29:36.648 --> 29:38.315
his mother
raised holy hell about it

29:38.350 --> 29:40.618
to that guidance counselor,
Dave's dad,

29:40.653 --> 29:42.621
and that team booster,
Marvin Watts.

29:42.655 --> 29:44.122
Yeah, and Sheriff Handell.

29:44.156 --> 29:45.490
No one did anything about it.

29:45.524 --> 29:47.158
So there's your motive
and opportunity.

29:47.193 --> 29:50.828
Well, a grieving mother.
An entire town to blame.

29:50.863 --> 29:52.163
Yep.

29:52.197 --> 29:53.498
- Rachel.
- What?

29:53.532 --> 29:54.799
Rachel just went
to that woman's house.

29:54.833 --> 29:56.567
Oh, my God.

29:56.601 --> 29:58.168
Come on!

29:58.203 --> 30:00.436
Is that nutmeg and cayenne?

30:00.471 --> 30:03.973
Hm.
I'm impressed.

30:04.008 --> 30:09.012
I only use a pinch of
cayenne for the whole batch.

30:09.046 --> 30:10.680
That was Chris' favorite.

30:10.715 --> 30:12.983
You really loved him,
didn't you?

30:13.017 --> 30:15.553
He was my son.

30:15.587 --> 30:18.790
My parents, um...
Think I'm a freak.

30:18.824 --> 30:20.959
Oh, I can't believe that.

30:20.993 --> 30:24.930
The cayenne,
that was nothing.

30:24.964 --> 30:26.798
I can taste every ingredient.

30:26.833 --> 30:30.068
This blanket--
Alpaca and silk.

30:30.102 --> 30:32.837
Plus 5% performance fleece.

30:32.871 --> 30:34.872
I can tell you that just
by touching it.

30:34.906 --> 30:36.840
All my senses are
that strong.

30:36.874 --> 30:40.277
That's amazing.

30:40.311 --> 30:41.878
Have you
always been like that?

30:41.912 --> 30:44.781
You should hear
what my parents say.

30:44.815 --> 30:47.617
I hear them.

30:47.651 --> 30:49.586
They think I'm sick
because

30:49.620 --> 30:51.622
I can't stand
the sight of germs,

30:51.656 --> 30:54.324
because
sometimes I won't eat.

30:54.359 --> 30:58.163
They pray that
they can find someone--

30:58.197 --> 31:01.567
anyone to marry me.

31:01.601 --> 31:06.005
But I can't even handle
a kiss.

31:06.039 --> 31:09.841
Who's gonna wanna
marry someone like that?

31:09.876 --> 31:14.746
The only thing I'm good for
is being a walking crime lab.

31:14.781 --> 31:18.683
Have you told
your mother how you feel?

31:18.718 --> 31:20.885
She won't
talk to me about it.

31:22.321 --> 31:24.522
In fact, she won't talk
to me about anything right now.

31:26.191 --> 31:31.429
That's...

31:31.464 --> 31:33.165
That's Agent Harken.

31:33.199 --> 31:35.868
He probably knows
something about Chris.

31:35.902 --> 31:39.839
I should get that.
Rachel...

31:39.873 --> 31:44.078
It can wait.

31:44.112 --> 31:45.212
I'm here for you.

31:45.247 --> 31:51.219
Oh.

31:51.253 --> 31:54.255
Oh, angel.

32:00.829 --> 32:03.831
Oh, there, there.

32:10.972 --> 32:14.007
There.

32:14.041 --> 32:15.609
How do you feel?

32:15.643 --> 32:18.645
I feel wonderful.

32:28.693 --> 32:29.942
No, no, wait, wait.

32:29.943 --> 32:31.699
What?

32:34.347 --> 32:35.614
Small town.

32:35.649 --> 32:37.683
Whatever.

32:46.527 --> 32:48.827
- Anything?
- No, all clear.

32:48.862 --> 32:52.998
I'll try Rachel.

33:01.807 --> 33:05.075
Rachel.

33:05.110 --> 33:08.779
I am so glad that I
can finally talk to someone.

33:08.813 --> 33:10.347
I don't know why but I feel

33:10.382 --> 33:13.083
like I can trust you
with anything.

33:13.118 --> 33:15.285
You can.

33:15.319 --> 33:19.556
I wanna trust Dr. Rosen.
I do, but...

33:19.590 --> 33:22.692
Sometimes I think all he
cares about is my Alpha ability.

33:22.727 --> 33:27.964
So all of your team members
are Alphas like you?

33:27.999 --> 33:31.001
Yeah.
Everybody, except for Dr. Rosen.

33:34.038 --> 33:35.472
Where are we going?

33:35.507 --> 33:38.709
Well, we have to
make one stop.

33:38.743 --> 33:41.378
And then I'll need
your help to get away.

33:41.413 --> 33:43.347
Away?

33:43.381 --> 33:45.450
Away from what?

33:45.484 --> 33:48.286
Nina, has Gary pinged
Mrs. Elkhart's cell phone yet?

33:48.320 --> 33:49.554
Sir, you can't touch that.

33:49.588 --> 33:51.789
- Hey, that's illegal.
- DCIS.

33:51.823 --> 33:55.559
A little room, please.

33:55.594 --> 33:57.995
- Any luck, Gar?
- No, I've got signal overload.

33:58.030 --> 33:59.830
The Doppler Radar truck's
in the neighborhood.

33:59.865 --> 34:03.134
I hate Doppler 2,000.
And 3,000, 4,000...

34:03.168 --> 34:04.769
- Okay, you heard that?
- If I think back,

34:04.803 --> 34:08.005
Rachel was drawn
to that woman immediately.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.274
She could die.

34:10.309 --> 34:11.409
Well, from what you said,

34:11.443 --> 34:13.344
this Jessica has
no reason to hurt Rachel.

34:13.378 --> 34:15.380
Well, I don't think
Mrs. Elkhart's fully rational.

34:15.414 --> 34:17.983
The oxytocin bond works
both ways.

34:18.016 --> 34:19.617
And I think
Chris' death triggered

34:19.652 --> 34:22.187
something akin to
psychotic postpartum depression.

34:22.221 --> 34:24.889
And Rachel's incredibly
vulnerable just now.

34:24.922 --> 34:26.024
Not just emotionally,

34:26.058 --> 34:27.525
but physically
because of her abilities.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.594
Okay, I found her.
The Doppler's gone.

34:29.628 --> 34:31.529
They're moving
east on Crosscreek Road.

34:31.563 --> 34:32.998
Hicks and Harken
are close.

34:33.032 --> 34:35.699
Get Harken and Hicks.
Put them on. Put me on.

34:35.734 --> 34:39.370
You killed those people.

34:39.404 --> 34:42.139
Why? How?

34:42.172 --> 34:45.509
When Chris was born...

34:45.543 --> 34:49.748
I felt this
overwhelming rush of love.

34:49.782 --> 34:52.817
And from that point on,

34:52.851 --> 34:55.387
I could make other people
feel that way too.

34:55.420 --> 34:57.456
I don't see how
that could hurt anybody.

34:57.490 --> 34:59.825
Neither did I,
until Chris' funeral.

34:59.860 --> 35:02.461
David's father
came to me crying

35:02.495 --> 35:06.464
about what his son had done.

35:06.499 --> 35:11.003
And I comforted him.

35:11.037 --> 35:14.473
Then he told me he knew about
the bullying and did nothing.

35:14.507 --> 35:18.610
I told him I never
wanted to see his face again.

35:18.644 --> 35:21.546
The next day...
He was dead.

35:21.580 --> 35:24.983
That's when I knew how I could
make things right for Chris.

35:25.017 --> 35:27.018
You're talking about murder.

35:27.053 --> 35:28.320
I'm talking about justice.

35:28.354 --> 35:30.756
Jessica,
please, stop this.

35:30.790 --> 35:33.193
You're a good person--
No, I begged them

35:33.227 --> 35:37.064
to stop David and his friends.
I begged them.

35:37.098 --> 35:40.635
And they blamed Chris.

35:40.669 --> 35:43.170
They blamed him and
said that he was too sensitive.

35:43.205 --> 35:45.840
That I should--I should
take him to a therapist,

35:45.874 --> 35:48.276
and I should toughen him up.
Dr. Rosen can help you.

35:48.310 --> 35:51.612
- I don't need his help!
- It hurts.

35:51.646 --> 35:53.280
I'm sorry, Rachel.

35:53.314 --> 35:55.883
But you're
supposed to be helping me.

35:55.917 --> 35:58.251
If you help me...

35:58.286 --> 36:02.089
You'll feel better.

36:02.123 --> 36:03.757
Okay, yeah.
They're heading east.

36:03.791 --> 36:06.159
Just head east.

36:06.194 --> 36:07.728
Okay, now wait, go right.

36:07.762 --> 36:09.429
- Are you su--
- Yeah, go right, now.

36:15.337 --> 36:17.105
- Through the woods?
- You should've let me drive.

36:17.140 --> 36:19.408
You know what, it's my car.

36:19.442 --> 36:23.445
Okay, you can cut them off
at the next intersection.

36:23.480 --> 36:26.048
Floor it.

36:26.082 --> 36:27.783
Boondocks.

36:27.817 --> 36:30.720
Hello?

36:38.963 --> 36:41.998
Damnit, Gary.
I broke my axle.

36:42.032 --> 36:43.500
I told you,
you should've let me drive.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.270
That's not my fault.
You can drive safe and fast.

36:46.304 --> 36:48.372
Hands at ten and two.
Gary, whatever.

36:51.744 --> 36:54.746
So now what?

37:00.320 --> 37:03.756
I don't know about you...

37:03.790 --> 37:06.792
But I'm gonna run.

37:11.698 --> 37:15.266
What is it?

37:15.301 --> 37:17.002
What do you see that I can't?

37:17.036 --> 37:19.170
Rachel.

37:19.204 --> 37:20.871
It's Bill.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.739
And the others can't
be far behind.

37:32.150 --> 37:34.985
Okay, Rachel.
Come on.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.821
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.055
What's going on?

37:38.090 --> 37:39.990
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

37:40.025 --> 37:42.360
I'm sorry,
but I've run out of time.

37:42.394 --> 37:45.630
What?

37:45.664 --> 37:47.165
- I don't love you.
- Agh!

37:47.199 --> 37:50.202
I want you to die.

37:55.809 --> 38:00.579
Agh.

38:00.614 --> 38:03.049
Rachel.
Rachel, Rachel.

38:03.083 --> 38:06.085
Rachel.

38:17.670 --> 38:20.371
Oh, Jessica.

38:20.406 --> 38:22.807
Thank goodness.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.675
I am so glad that you called.

38:24.710 --> 38:27.312
With the Feds taking David
and all those people dying,

38:27.346 --> 38:30.949
I just feel
like I am losing it.

38:30.983 --> 38:34.553
But if we can talk,
I know I'll feel so much better.

38:34.587 --> 38:37.256
It always helps so much.

38:37.291 --> 38:39.392
I won't be here long.

38:39.426 --> 38:41.027
Why not?

38:41.061 --> 38:43.096
You murdered my son, Kent.

38:43.130 --> 38:44.998
You and the rest of them.
No.

38:45.032 --> 38:46.766
And now, I want you

38:46.801 --> 38:52.106
to spend your last few hours
dying alone.

38:52.140 --> 38:54.375
Doc, she's not responding.
What do I do?

38:54.409 --> 38:56.010
Hold her still, Bill.

38:56.044 --> 38:58.212
- Rachel.
- What is that?

38:58.247 --> 39:00.381
It's oxytocin.

39:00.415 --> 39:01.782
Something to counteract
the withdrawal.

39:01.816 --> 39:03.183
This doesn't
look like withdrawal, Doc.

39:03.218 --> 39:04.418
I mean,
it's happening too fast.

39:04.452 --> 39:07.053
For anyone else,
but not for Rachel.

39:07.087 --> 39:09.222
She's not anyone else.
Come on, girl.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.558
Oh, God, it's not working.

39:12.592 --> 39:16.028
It's not
breaking the pain cycle.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.095
Maybe she can.

39:17.130 --> 39:19.965
Rachel, Rachel,
listen to me.

39:19.999 --> 39:21.534
Focus on my voice.

39:21.568 --> 39:23.970
Hold her.
Hold her tight.

39:24.004 --> 39:25.438
Focus on the feeling
of our hands.

39:25.473 --> 39:28.475
Just that feeling.
Block everything else out.

39:28.509 --> 39:30.811
Feel the comfort.
I need her.

39:30.845 --> 39:32.780
Her love is not real.

39:32.815 --> 39:35.250
Real love is
unconditional, Rachel.

39:35.284 --> 39:36.451
Listen to me.

39:36.486 --> 39:38.420
I care about you
more than you will ever know.

39:38.454 --> 39:40.655
You're like a daughter to me.

39:40.690 --> 39:43.058
You always have been
and you always will be.

39:43.092 --> 39:45.726
Concentrate.
Concentrate.

39:45.760 --> 39:48.095
We love you, Rachel.

39:48.129 --> 39:50.230
We love you, Rachel,
all of us.

39:50.264 --> 39:53.166
- Rachel.
- Listen to the Doc, Rachel.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.334
You okay?

39:54.368 --> 39:56.169
Come on.
You can do it.

39:56.203 --> 40:00.606
Focus on the feeling
of our hands.

40:00.641 --> 40:02.609
It's working.
You're doing it.

40:02.643 --> 40:04.077
She's doing it.

40:04.111 --> 40:06.146
You're doing it.
You're doing it.

40:06.181 --> 40:07.882
- Okay, pull her up.
- Yeah, come here.

40:07.916 --> 40:10.351
- Dr. Rosen.
- Yes, yes.

40:10.385 --> 40:11.886
We're right here.
We're all here.

40:11.921 --> 40:12.954
You're good?

40:12.989 --> 40:16.191
Good girl.
Oh, good girl.

40:18.261 --> 40:20.730
Don't do this, okay.
I love you.

40:20.764 --> 40:22.898
I would do anything to
bring Chris back, anything!

40:22.933 --> 40:24.166
A little late for that.

40:24.201 --> 40:25.468
I know things
got out-of-hand, okay?

40:25.502 --> 40:26.635
I admit that.

40:26.669 --> 40:28.036
But if Chris wanted
to play ball,

40:28.070 --> 40:30.372
he needed to be
a whole lot tougher than he was.

40:30.406 --> 40:32.774
Nobody thought he would drive
into a telephone pole, nobody.

40:32.809 --> 40:34.476
Always comes back to that,
doesn't it?

40:34.510 --> 40:36.978
It always comes back to
"It's always Chris' fault,"

40:37.012 --> 40:38.279
"It's Chris' problem."

40:38.314 --> 40:42.350
I am--I am so
sick of hearing that.

40:42.384 --> 40:43.585
What do you want me
to do, Jessica?

40:43.619 --> 40:45.053
Just tell me
and I will do it.

40:45.088 --> 40:46.421
I swear I will do it.

40:46.456 --> 40:49.659
Burn in hell.

40:56.635 --> 40:58.970
Hold it right there.
Right there, don't move.

40:59.004 --> 41:00.371
Don't let her touch you.

41:00.406 --> 41:03.275
We're gonna need an ambulance
at 57 Poplar Way.

41:03.309 --> 41:05.210
Where are you going?
Don't let him--

41:05.245 --> 41:07.546
don't help him.
He let my son die.

41:07.580 --> 41:08.881
I'm sorry to hear that.

41:08.915 --> 41:10.683
But killing someone else
is not gonna help you, is it?

41:10.718 --> 41:12.919
Jessica, stop.

41:12.954 --> 41:15.489
Chris wouldn't have
wanted you to hurt anyone.

41:15.523 --> 41:19.326
Not for him.

41:19.361 --> 41:20.927
I miss him.

41:20.962 --> 41:23.530
I know.

41:23.564 --> 41:28.035
I miss him.

41:32.306 --> 41:33.773
So what did you
tell everyone this time?

41:33.808 --> 41:35.809
I kept it simple.

41:35.843 --> 41:38.845
That Jessica poisoned
her victims.

41:38.879 --> 41:42.248
Which is true, to a point.

41:46.620 --> 41:49.054
She's going away,
isn't she?

41:49.089 --> 41:51.890
To Binghamton.
Yeah.

41:51.925 --> 41:54.859
Yes, and I hope
this isn't a portent

41:54.894 --> 41:56.895
of more such cases to come.

41:56.929 --> 42:00.031
The danger.

42:00.065 --> 42:02.801
That said, how are you?

42:02.835 --> 42:04.936
Should have that
printed up on T-shirts.

42:07.006 --> 42:08.740
I'm alive...

42:08.775 --> 42:11.543
Thanks to you.

42:11.578 --> 42:12.978
Thank yourself, Rachel.

42:13.013 --> 42:16.016
It was your own ability
that saved your life.

42:20.088 --> 42:24.357
You're a very capable
young woman.

42:24.392 --> 42:26.426
More than you know.

42:26.460 --> 42:32.431
What do you say we go home?

42:32.465 --> 42:35.467
Home sounds good.
