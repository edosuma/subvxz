00:27.819 --> 00:30.188
- When will you be back?
- This evening.

00:35.326 --> 00:36.461
Be careful.

00:38.563 --> 00:42.467
Well, this coward couldn't
kill me when he had
the jump on us,

00:42.467 --> 00:44.435
damn sure ain't killing me
when we have the jump.

00:45.803 --> 00:47.305
Say it.

00:48.873 --> 00:50.441
I'll be careful.

00:53.144 --> 00:54.445
I love you.

01:33.084 --> 01:34.685
Be back by supper.

01:34.685 --> 01:36.687
Just come back.

06:08.559 --> 06:09.994
Champagne in the morning?

06:12.930 --> 06:16.133
The sky can't decide if
it's gonna rain or snow.

06:16.133 --> 06:18.302
I don't want to be out
in either.

06:18.302 --> 06:21.005
I think we'll waste this day
right here.

06:45.729 --> 06:47.698
I want some.

06:47.698 --> 06:48.933
Sure you do.

06:50.501 --> 06:52.036
Roll over.

07:11.856 --> 07:12.823
Wait.

07:15.793 --> 07:17.328
My fucking luck.

07:18.596 --> 07:21.732
I mean it. Wait.
I'm the one who's paying.

07:28.772 --> 07:30.875
I'm fucking coming.

07:32.676 --> 07:35.112
Banner Creighton,
you're under arrest.

07:35.112 --> 07:36.547
For what?

07:36.547 --> 07:39.483
Two counts of murder, and four
counts of attempted murder.

07:39.483 --> 07:42.520
Who'd I murder?

07:42.520 --> 07:44.455
And who the fuck did
I attempt to murder?

07:51.428 --> 07:54.465
Look like you've seen
a ghost, Banner.

07:54.465 --> 07:56.867
And you have.

07:56.867 --> 07:59.003
If you're arresting me,
arrest him.

07:59.003 --> 08:02.606
This fucking jackal hung me
by my neck

08:02.606 --> 08:05.476
and left me to die,
killed my friends

08:05.476 --> 08:07.011
for trespassing.

08:07.011 --> 08:10.548
And he was well
within his rights.

08:10.548 --> 08:11.882
Turn around.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.617
At least let me
get fuckin' dressed.

08:13.617 --> 08:16.854
County jail has got
a brand new suit for you.

08:25.896 --> 08:28.065
I see you brought
your army, Jake.

08:28.065 --> 08:30.701
You're gonna need 'em.
You hear me?

08:30.701 --> 08:31.969
You're gonna fucking need 'em!!!

08:36.040 --> 08:37.474
Nice robe.

08:37.474 --> 08:39.243
Keep smiling, pup.

08:39.243 --> 08:41.078
You cheated death twice.

08:41.078 --> 08:43.314
You won't cheat it
a third time.

08:45.015 --> 08:47.351
That sounds a lot like
a confession to me, Banner.

09:06.403 --> 09:08.005
Oh, God...

09:50.981 --> 09:52.149
We're ready.

09:53.417 --> 09:55.019
Clear 'em out.

09:55.019 --> 09:56.854
Clear back!

10:56.013 --> 10:58.148
Jake Dutton...
I saw him.

10:58.148 --> 10:59.750
Saw him?

10:59.750 --> 11:02.419
In town.
With the sheriff...

11:02.419 --> 11:04.254
Went to Banner's house.

11:04.254 --> 11:06.023
Did they kill him?

11:06.023 --> 11:07.825
Arrested him.

11:07.825 --> 11:11.595
That was their first mistake.

11:53.303 --> 11:55.539
I'm here to see
my client, Banner Creighton.

11:55.539 --> 11:57.975
That was fast.

11:57.975 --> 11:59.109
Has arraignment been set?

11:59.109 --> 12:01.211
Eight AM.
Tomorrow morning.

12:01.211 --> 12:03.247
Has a judge been assigned?

12:03.247 --> 12:06.517
Uh... Rawlins.

12:10.454 --> 12:13.123
Council for 2314.

12:33.443 --> 12:35.145
We'll post bond
once bail is set.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.815
They'll not set bail
for a murder charge.

12:37.815 --> 12:39.116
Bail will be set.

12:39.116 --> 12:40.984
Don't speak to anyone.

12:40.984 --> 12:44.555
Not your cell mate,
not the detectives, no one.

12:46.089 --> 12:47.124
Refer them to me.

12:57.734 --> 13:00.437
There's two hookers
in my house.

13:00.437 --> 13:03.373
Can we have them run off
before they rob me blind?

13:03.373 --> 13:05.742
Is there anything
incriminating in the house?

13:05.742 --> 13:07.845
I don't know
what incriminating means.

13:07.845 --> 13:09.279
Any evidence that
would support

13:09.279 --> 13:10.848
their charges against you.

13:10.848 --> 13:12.316
There's nothing at the house.

13:15.552 --> 13:16.653
What's the address?

13:16.653 --> 13:18.555
418 Hancock.

13:24.361 --> 13:26.296
You really think
I'll be out of here tomorrow?

13:26.296 --> 13:27.764
I'm certain.

13:59.730 --> 14:02.733
Arraignment is in the morning.
Rawlins is the judge.

14:04.468 --> 14:07.371
Make sure he understands
how essential Banner is

14:07.371 --> 14:08.739
to my operations.

14:08.739 --> 14:11.241
I'll find him this evening.

14:11.241 --> 14:12.876
Mister Creighton mentioned
there are two women

14:12.876 --> 14:15.279
of ill repute in his residence.

14:15.279 --> 14:17.648
He asked that I remove
them from the premises.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.683
Ill repute?

14:19.683 --> 14:20.684
Prostitutes, sir.

14:20.684 --> 14:22.452
Ah.

14:22.452 --> 14:23.754
Would you like them removed?

14:25.489 --> 14:26.790
I'll remove them.

15:00.724 --> 15:04.394
Seems like you two don't
need a customer at all.

15:04.394 --> 15:05.963
Who are you?

15:05.963 --> 15:08.966
This is my house.

15:08.966 --> 15:10.867
I thought it
was Banner's house.

15:10.867 --> 15:13.003
Banner lives here.

15:13.003 --> 15:14.271
But I own it.

15:14.271 --> 15:15.973
It's lovely.

15:15.973 --> 15:17.474
Thank you.

15:17.474 --> 15:22.512
I assume Banner failed
to pay you before he left.

15:22.512 --> 15:23.580
Not yet.

15:33.056 --> 15:34.458
Does that cover it?

15:36.860 --> 15:37.995
That's too much.

15:37.995 --> 15:41.031
Well, we haven't
finished yet, have we?

15:56.813 --> 15:58.248
What do you like?

15:58.248 --> 15:59.850
I'm going to show you.

16:05.489 --> 16:06.823
He's a naughty one.

16:08.558 --> 16:10.360
If you only knew.

16:34.384 --> 16:35.652
A real naughty one.

16:55.105 --> 16:56.907
Not like that.

17:04.214 --> 17:06.216
Ah!

17:09.219 --> 17:10.454
Like that.

17:15.592 --> 17:19.229
Just...
like that, yes?

17:26.269 --> 17:29.372
Not a sound from you.

17:29.372 --> 17:32.676
I take no pleasure in screams.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.391
Ah...

18:10.408 --> 18:11.542
Who are you writing?

18:11.542 --> 18:13.778
Spencer.

18:13.778 --> 18:14.879
My youngest.

18:14.879 --> 18:18.216
Well, he's not mine,
but I call him mine.

18:18.216 --> 18:19.917
- Jack's uncle.
- Yes.

18:19.917 --> 18:21.252
Isn't he coming home?

18:21.252 --> 18:22.587
He is.

18:22.587 --> 18:24.856
Then...
How can you send him a letter?

18:24.856 --> 18:26.624
I can't.

18:26.624 --> 18:28.359
It's more for me.

18:28.359 --> 18:32.363
I suppose you could call
it journaling...

18:32.363 --> 18:35.433
but writing to one's self seems
so narcissistic

18:35.433 --> 18:36.934
I can't bring myself to do it.

18:36.934 --> 18:39.370
So, I address
my thoughts to him.

18:40.304 --> 18:41.606
What do you tell him?

18:41.606 --> 18:42.540
Everything.

18:42.540 --> 18:45.410
How I feel,
what I made for supper.

18:45.410 --> 18:46.911
I told him about you.

18:46.911 --> 18:48.880
- Me?
- About the baby.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.215
How you can tame Jack
with a look.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.251
I would hardly say he's tamed.

18:53.251 --> 18:56.254
Spencer was always
a very quiet boy.

18:57.555 --> 19:00.458
Very still.
Always watching.

19:00.458 --> 19:02.894
Deliberate in
everything he did.

19:02.894 --> 19:06.364
I could jabber away for hours,
and he would just listen.

19:08.933 --> 19:09.834
I suppose that's
what I'm doing now.

19:11.002 --> 19:13.404
You do it when they're gone.

19:14.772 --> 19:17.208
Yes.

19:17.208 --> 19:18.710
I think I'm more like Jack.

19:18.710 --> 19:20.478
I need a purpose.

19:22.213 --> 19:24.882
This waiting suffocates me.

19:27.385 --> 19:28.653
Me too.

19:31.723 --> 19:34.459
Well, then,
you need a purpose.

19:35.359 --> 19:36.327
My thoughts...

19:38.196 --> 19:40.932
I have trouble putting
my thoughts into words.

19:40.932 --> 19:43.101
Ah. What then?

19:44.435 --> 19:46.771
Maybe I'll...
I'll bake a cake.

19:46.771 --> 19:48.239
You know how
to bake a cake?

19:48.239 --> 19:50.441
No.

19:51.976 --> 19:54.345
I can remedy that.

20:13.831 --> 20:16.334
How's this?

20:16.334 --> 20:18.603
All the lumps must be gone.

20:18.603 --> 20:21.572
I have much more respect for
bakers than I did yesterday.

20:21.572 --> 20:23.941
There is a measure of
labor that goes into it.

20:31.549 --> 20:32.884
Got caught in the rain?

20:32.884 --> 20:34.852
Little bit.

20:34.852 --> 20:36.721
We're baking a cake.

20:36.721 --> 20:38.589
I see that.

20:38.589 --> 20:40.091
What's the celebration?

20:40.091 --> 20:41.659
You coming home.

20:41.659 --> 20:43.161
We do that every night.

20:43.161 --> 20:45.797
If you're gonna bake us
cake every evening,

20:45.797 --> 20:47.665
we're gonna need
bigger horses.

20:57.642 --> 20:58.810
What happened?

20:58.810 --> 21:00.311
He's where he belongs.

21:00.311 --> 21:01.913
Where does he belong?

21:01.913 --> 21:05.016
In jail.
Awaiting trial.

21:05.016 --> 21:08.286
Where he will be convicted
and sent to the gallows.

21:10.288 --> 21:11.422
Thank you.

21:12.824 --> 21:14.125
Where's Jack?

21:14.125 --> 21:16.494
He's right behind me,
putting up the horses.

21:20.765 --> 21:22.633
Dramatic little thing,
isn't she?

21:22.633 --> 21:25.069
It's like having a new puppy.

21:25.069 --> 21:26.971
I remember when you
were the new puppy.

21:29.207 --> 21:30.608
No, you don't.

21:56.667 --> 21:58.970
Told you there was
nothing to worry about.

21:58.970 --> 22:01.439
You said evening.

22:01.439 --> 22:02.940
I did.

22:02.940 --> 22:04.475
You're late.

22:04.475 --> 22:06.310
I'm a little late.

22:17.722 --> 22:20.458
I can't wait to see what I get
when I've been gone for a week.

22:21.692 --> 22:23.828
You're not allowed
to be gone for a week.

22:36.407 --> 22:39.310
Calvin Coolidge had
two Grizzly Bears captured

22:39.310 --> 22:42.380
in Mexico released
on the White House lawn.

22:42.380 --> 22:44.048
Why'd he get them from Mexico?

22:44.048 --> 22:46.183
He can get all the grizzlies
he wants right here.

22:46.183 --> 22:49.186
Of all the things in that
headline to disturb you,

22:49.186 --> 22:52.323
where the bears are from is
the one thing that stands out?

22:52.323 --> 22:55.026
I'm saying that's a long way
to go for a grizzly.

22:55.026 --> 22:56.761
It doesn't bother you he
let them loose

22:56.761 --> 22:59.597
on the front yard of the
White House?

22:59.597 --> 23:01.232
I wouldn't want to be the man
who has to put them

23:01.232 --> 23:02.466
back in their cage.

23:04.669 --> 23:09.240
Unemployment at historic lows,
down to 2.4 percent.

23:09.240 --> 23:10.441
Where?

23:10.441 --> 23:12.176
Not here.

23:14.578 --> 23:18.015
New commission formed in
Washington to regulate mining,

23:18.015 --> 23:22.386
CEO of Anaconda Copper Mines
appointed chairman.

23:22.386 --> 23:24.088
Whitfield.

23:24.088 --> 23:29.427
Westfield Silver Mining CEO
Donald Whitfield, vice-chair...

23:30.828 --> 23:32.897
They put the bosses
of the mining companies

23:32.897 --> 23:34.565
in charge
of regulating the mines?

23:34.565 --> 23:36.567
That should tell you all
you need to know

23:36.567 --> 23:38.035
about politics, son.

23:38.035 --> 23:39.737
You're in politics.

23:39.737 --> 23:41.639
I'm in law enforcement.

23:41.639 --> 23:43.607
You enforce the laws
you push through.

23:43.607 --> 23:44.942
Jack.

23:44.942 --> 23:47.878
I ain't complaining, I'm just
saying it's the same thing.

23:47.878 --> 23:50.047
You're a cattleman in charge
of regulating cattle.

23:50.047 --> 23:51.349
Am I wrong?

23:51.349 --> 23:55.386
There's this theory that
these scientists came up with

23:55.386 --> 23:58.589
after studying
tribes in India and Africa,

23:58.589 --> 24:00.858
and South America.

24:00.858 --> 24:04.228
The smaller tribes didn't
have any government.

24:04.228 --> 24:06.097
Didn't need any.

24:06.097 --> 24:08.432
They could sit down and talk
out their problems,

24:08.432 --> 24:11.869
decide where to plant
crops, to hunt.

24:11.869 --> 24:15.639
They was just a big family, really.

24:15.639 --> 24:18.509
But when the number of people
got up around five hundred,

24:18.509 --> 24:20.544
if there wasn't any government,
the strongest people

24:20.544 --> 24:22.947
would take advantage
of the weakest...

24:22.947 --> 24:26.150
Every time.
Without fail.

24:26.150 --> 24:31.055
They would enslave,
rape, steal.

24:31.055 --> 24:36.761
Enrich their lives at the
expense of other people's lives.

24:36.761 --> 24:38.529
Government is man's
way of trying

24:38.529 --> 24:39.930
to control our behavior.

24:39.930 --> 24:43.300
But it can't be controlled,
it's what we are.

24:44.602 --> 24:46.637
Sooner or later, the kind
of people who would

24:46.637 --> 24:50.307
enrich themselves
at your expense,

24:50.307 --> 24:52.743
will use the government
to do it.

24:52.743 --> 24:56.814
And mark my words, one day
they'll create

24:56.814 --> 25:03.054
laws to control what we say,
how we think.

25:03.054 --> 25:06.257
They will outlaw our
right to disagree,

25:07.491 --> 25:09.760
if we let them.

25:09.760 --> 25:14.098
I created the commission
to protect the way this family

25:14.098 --> 25:16.267
provides for itself...

25:16.267 --> 25:18.102
How it protects the land.

25:20.438 --> 25:23.641
Isn't Whitfield doing
the same thing?

25:23.641 --> 25:26.677
The exact same thing.

25:26.677 --> 25:28.679
Unfortunately for him,

25:28.679 --> 25:31.882
what's good for his way of
life is not good for ours.

25:31.882 --> 25:33.384
What about right and wrong?

25:33.384 --> 25:37.121
No such thing.
Can't think that way.

25:37.121 --> 25:41.625
You can only think about
what's good for this ranch.

25:41.625 --> 25:46.030
What's good for your family,
that's it.

25:46.030 --> 25:49.133
Then use their rules to do it.

25:50.701 --> 25:52.336
A bear in the White House.

25:52.336 --> 25:54.772
Of all the things that happen
in the world each day,

25:54.772 --> 25:57.041
why is the news
telling you that?

25:57.041 --> 25:59.310
What aren't they telling
you, that's the question.

25:59.310 --> 26:01.912
This isn't the news, Jack.
This is camouflage.

26:05.316 --> 26:07.485
We don't talk politics
at the table.

26:07.485 --> 26:11.122
If you know what's good for you,
you'll remember that.

26:20.498 --> 26:22.566
How'd we both get in trouble?

26:22.566 --> 26:25.503
Banner in jail
doesn't solve anything.

26:25.503 --> 26:27.738
This fight ain't over.
It's just begun.

26:30.141 --> 26:32.176
She's not mad...

26:32.176 --> 26:34.311
she's scared.

31:30.435 --> 31:31.903
Speak English, boy?

31:31.903 --> 31:33.872
I speak English.

31:33.872 --> 31:35.507
What are you doing out here?

31:35.507 --> 31:37.075
Tending sheep.

31:40.111 --> 31:41.479
I don't see any sheep.

31:41.479 --> 31:43.648
That's why I'm
looking for 'em.

31:43.648 --> 31:46.184
Sounds like you
strayed from the flock.

31:46.184 --> 31:48.520
Flock strayed from me
while I was sleeping.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.822
I've seen no sheep tracks.

31:50.822 --> 31:53.491
Not following them.
I'm headed to water.

31:53.491 --> 31:55.193
That's where they'll be.

31:55.193 --> 31:57.529
How old are you?

31:57.529 --> 31:59.030
What do you care?

32:00.565 --> 32:02.500
You should be in school.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.935
Finished school.

32:03.935 --> 32:05.603
Where?

32:05.603 --> 32:06.871
Kansas.

32:06.871 --> 32:08.340
What's the name?

32:08.340 --> 32:10.275
I don't have to
answer your questions.

32:10.275 --> 32:13.044
You'll answer them or get drug
back to the school by your hair.

32:14.846 --> 32:16.314
You don't have the right.

32:45.243 --> 32:47.579
No telling which school
this one escaped from.

32:47.579 --> 32:50.281
Doesn't matter.
He's headed to ours, now.

33:07.165 --> 33:10.135
I'll run this one back.
You keep going.

33:10.135 --> 33:12.637
Where there's one
there's more.

33:12.637 --> 33:14.639
Maybe a whole camp of 'em.

33:14.639 --> 33:16.274
Wherever they are...

33:19.110 --> 33:20.111
she is.

33:24.349 --> 33:25.850
I'll take him back.

33:29.687 --> 33:31.790
I'm a man of the cloth.

33:31.790 --> 33:36.728
Which is to say,
I'm a man of my word.

33:36.728 --> 33:38.296
Ah! Ah!

34:38.651 --> 34:39.952
Heeya.

35:35.207 --> 35:37.176
I served a mission
in Argentina.

35:38.577 --> 35:39.679
Served one in Peru.

35:40.780 --> 35:42.314
The Philippines.

35:42.314 --> 35:44.383
All populated with
people like you.

35:46.619 --> 35:49.288
People who now thrive.

35:49.288 --> 35:51.557
They thrive.

35:51.557 --> 35:54.627
Build cities.

35:54.627 --> 35:57.296
Grow crops.

35:57.296 --> 35:58.698
All in the bosom of Christ.

35:59.932 --> 36:01.967
They followed our teachings
and they prosper.

36:03.235 --> 36:04.403
You...

36:07.039 --> 36:08.107
reject them.

36:09.675 --> 36:12.945
Fight them.

36:12.945 --> 36:14.747
And suffering is your reward.

36:17.416 --> 36:18.784
Salvation awaits
in the light,

36:20.720 --> 36:23.789
and yet...

36:23.789 --> 36:25.124
you people...

36:27.393 --> 36:28.594
choose darkness.

36:30.563 --> 36:31.731
Seek it.

36:34.066 --> 36:35.334
Crave it.

36:39.805 --> 36:41.941
I think your souls
have been spoken for already.

36:45.111 --> 36:46.512
I think the devil has them.

36:50.015 --> 36:51.984
You don't need schools.

36:53.819 --> 36:55.154
You need exorcisms.

37:01.093 --> 37:02.128
You are a priest?

37:05.598 --> 37:07.166
I am.

37:08.534 --> 37:10.169
A holy man.

37:11.804 --> 37:13.072
Yes.

37:14.073 --> 37:16.342
But you've killed.

37:16.342 --> 37:19.011
In the name of God.

37:19.011 --> 37:20.880
Stolen.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.848
What have I stolen?

37:22.848 --> 37:25.084
The land you sit on.

37:25.084 --> 37:27.052
I have stolen nothing.

37:27.052 --> 37:30.890
If you hadn't stolen it,
you wouldn't be here.

37:30.890 --> 37:33.125
You'd be somewhere else.

37:33.125 --> 37:35.361
I don't understand
your pagan logic.

37:37.196 --> 37:39.298
Your God has all these laws.

37:39.298 --> 37:40.466
I know them.

37:40.466 --> 37:42.334
I studied them.

37:42.334 --> 37:45.504
You're supposed
to teach His laws,

37:45.504 --> 37:47.640
but you break them
to teach them.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.810
So, the laws means
nothing to you.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.778
Which means...

37:52.778 --> 37:55.447
Your God doesn't exist,
and you know it.

38:02.755 --> 38:05.558
Blasphemy.
You godless heathen.

38:09.094 --> 38:11.931
I think the world will be a
better place without you in it.

38:12.598 --> 38:14.400
Without any of you.

38:14.400 --> 38:17.536
Our Father, who art in Heaven.

38:17.536 --> 38:19.305
Look at me when I speak!

38:19.305 --> 38:22.408
Hallowed be thy name.

38:22.408 --> 38:25.211
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done.

38:25.211 --> 38:27.379
On Earth as it is in Heaven...

38:34.620 --> 38:37.456
If his will is done on earth,
and my knife is to your throat,

38:37.456 --> 38:39.992
this must be what
your God wants.

38:55.307 --> 38:57.009
Can you walk?

38:57.009 --> 38:58.210
I can run if you want.

38:58.210 --> 38:59.845
We let the horses run.

38:59.845 --> 39:02.348
There's two more priests
looking for Teonna.

39:02.348 --> 39:04.116
I saw the tracks.

39:04.116 --> 39:06.185
Which way did they go?

39:06.185 --> 39:07.953
Hank in the badlands?

39:07.953 --> 39:09.622
By the Red Creek.

39:11.457 --> 39:13.592
They will stop for the night.

39:13.592 --> 39:14.760
We won't.

39:17.496 --> 39:19.098
What do we do with him?

39:25.504 --> 39:27.773
Go wait with the horses.

40:04.643 --> 40:06.278
What did you do?

40:06.278 --> 40:08.047
Ate his soul.

40:09.782 --> 40:12.551
We must ride fast.
Keep up.

40:13.352 --> 40:14.520
He...

40:47.753 --> 40:49.855
Boy!

40:54.927 --> 40:56.628
This one's school age,
as well.

40:56.628 --> 40:59.198
Well, at least he's got
a vocation.

40:59.198 --> 41:01.367
Tending sheep is God's work.

41:11.610 --> 41:15.347
We are looking for a girl.
About fifteen.

41:16.181 --> 41:17.816
Why looking for her?

41:17.816 --> 41:19.651
Broke the law.

41:19.651 --> 41:20.953
What law?

41:20.953 --> 41:23.756
We owe you no
explanation, child.

41:23.756 --> 41:25.758
Have you seen a girl?

41:25.758 --> 41:28.193
I've seen no girl.

42:19.278 --> 42:20.746
Ah!

42:24.783 --> 42:25.984
Let me see.

42:30.522 --> 42:32.124
The girl has blinded you.

42:36.895 --> 42:38.597
You godless witch!

42:41.867 --> 42:43.202
You'll kill her, brother.

42:45.170 --> 42:47.272
With God as my witness.

42:53.712 --> 42:55.314
Aah!

43:15.701 --> 43:16.969
Wait--

43:30.315 --> 43:32.050
He beat you up pretty good.

43:32.050 --> 43:33.118
Can you stand?

44:25.070 --> 44:27.539
Goddam your fucking soul.

45:25.191 --> 45:28.628
I'll have a skiff run you in.
It'll be faster.

45:28.628 --> 45:30.964
I can do without
customs boarding the vessel.

45:30.964 --> 45:33.032
Understood.

45:36.269 --> 45:37.904
I'm in your debt.

45:37.904 --> 45:39.773
You're in no such thing.

45:40.974 --> 45:43.109
I think perhaps the sea is
the last place where men

45:43.109 --> 45:45.311
do the right thing for
that reason alone.

45:45.311 --> 45:48.148
Maybe the whole world
should be put to sea.

45:48.148 --> 45:50.116
Whole world would drown.

45:52.385 --> 45:55.655
If ever I find myself in
the company of a leopard,

45:55.655 --> 45:57.590
I'd appreciate some assistance.

45:57.590 --> 45:59.225
I didn't tell you
I was a hunter.

45:59.225 --> 46:03.096
You're famous, Spencer Dutton.

46:03.096 --> 46:04.697
In case you are unaware.

46:08.501 --> 46:09.702
I'm becoming aware.

46:11.871 --> 46:14.641
Speaking of wild cats,

46:14.641 --> 46:16.743
you've a tiger by the tail
with your new bride.

47:06.826 --> 47:09.896
Mussolini's not a fan
folks carrying guns.

47:09.896 --> 47:12.699
Different rules in Sicily,
but if you go inland,

47:12.699 --> 47:14.968
you'll need to
hide that thing.

47:14.968 --> 47:17.370
Mafia won't like it
too much either, though.

47:17.370 --> 47:18.905
What's the mafia?

47:18.905 --> 47:22.809
Stay here long you'll
find out, mate.

47:22.809 --> 47:24.244
Thank you.

47:27.113 --> 47:28.615
Let's find a hotel.

47:28.615 --> 47:31.184
Spoken like a man who
thinks he's in control.

47:31.184 --> 47:34.654
Let's find a cafe.
I need pasta and wine.

47:37.690 --> 47:39.959
Deep down you love
being told what to do.

47:39.959 --> 47:41.127
There's a freedom in it.

47:41.127 --> 47:42.562
And we all know how
you Americans

47:42.562 --> 47:44.264
feel about your freedom.

47:45.298 --> 47:46.499
Hey.

47:50.270 --> 47:52.739
I'll follow you...

47:52.739 --> 47:54.040
but I ain't walking
behind you.

47:54.040 --> 47:57.844
You sure?
It's a pretty good view.

48:04.350 --> 48:07.186
If I was a betting man,
I'd bet you're smiling.

48:22.302 --> 48:23.536
You booked us passage?

48:24.704 --> 48:25.738
We leave on Thursday.

48:27.907 --> 48:28.942
You're not eating.

48:31.344 --> 48:32.412
I'm not hungry.

48:32.412 --> 48:33.880
How is that possible?

48:33.880 --> 48:36.416
Don't know.
Just ain't.

48:36.416 --> 48:38.451
You've become the lions
you hunted.

48:38.451 --> 48:42.221
Gorging yourself on a kill
then sleeping in the sun

48:42.221 --> 48:46.526
for a week till you muster
the energy to bed a lioness.

48:46.526 --> 48:48.094
I won't wait a week,
I'll have you know.

49:00.640 --> 49:01.741
This is the first time
I've been in a restaurant

49:01.741 --> 49:03.977
with somebody since
I left Montana.

49:03.977 --> 49:06.946
Pesky, these demons of yours.

49:14.654 --> 49:17.423
The further we move from danger
the more we'll see them, I fear.

49:18.691 --> 49:20.393
We're not moving
further from danger.

49:25.064 --> 49:27.767
Eat. I demand it.

49:27.767 --> 49:28.868
What is it?

49:28.868 --> 49:31.371
Rice.

49:31.371 --> 49:33.239
Don't look like rice.

49:33.239 --> 49:36.009
It's rice rolled
in flour and fried.

49:36.009 --> 49:37.510
How do you know the food here?

49:39.045 --> 49:40.747
I'm British.

49:40.747 --> 49:42.882
All we do is travel the world
and become experts

49:42.882 --> 49:44.584
on the places we visit.

49:44.584 --> 49:45.985
That don't make sense.

49:45.985 --> 49:48.254
Like I said, I'm British.

49:48.254 --> 49:51.324
So, your culture is based
on pretending to be experts

49:51.324 --> 49:53.826
on things you know
nothing about.

49:53.826 --> 49:56.829
No, baby.

49:56.829 --> 49:58.598
That's the French.

50:04.003 --> 50:06.039
Made you smile.

50:06.039 --> 50:07.740
My Holy Grail.

50:07.740 --> 50:10.209
- You need loftier goals.
- No, I don't.

50:15.281 --> 50:16.516
Eat.

50:24.457 --> 50:25.691
Well?

50:25.691 --> 50:27.126
Pretty good.

50:27.126 --> 50:29.762
Experts. I told you.

50:41.941 --> 50:42.975
Alexandra?
