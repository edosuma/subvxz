WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.636
<i>Previously</i>
on "The Blacklist",

00:02.770 --> 00:04.838
I'm not an errand boy.
I won't be ordered about.

00:04.972 --> 00:07.941
We'd like you
to make this go away.

00:08.076 --> 00:10.144
We know about Keen.
What she's saying.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.979
That you're N-13.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.614
<i>Elizabeth's gone,</i>
and she's taken

00:13.747 --> 00:15.449
<i>something of mine with her.</i>

00:15.583 --> 00:17.518
<i>I suppose you also</i>
think that she's responsible

00:17.651 --> 00:18.952
<i>for The Freelancer's</i>
release.

00:19.087 --> 00:20.654
<i>There's always more</i>
to the story.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.356
Where is he?
The work of a man

00:22.490 --> 00:23.957
who disguises his killings

00:24.092 --> 00:26.660
in the headlines
of everyday tragedies.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.230
<i>The arrest that you</i>
made earlier. Mason Dieterle.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.232
<i>He burned down</i>
my friend's restaurant.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.302
<i>I just got off the phone with</i>
the AUSA reviewing the case.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.570
<i>He told me that your friend</i>
passed away from her injuries.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.372
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

00:38.506 --> 00:40.641
<i>You promised me you wouldn't</i>
do anything to Dieterle.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.144
I need to know,
did you break that promise?

00:46.013 --> 00:47.481
No, sir.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.852
We've been formulating

00:51.985 --> 00:53.987
those binary structures
you gave us for weeks

00:54.122 --> 00:56.890
and, I think
we've done it.

00:57.024 --> 00:59.026
We identified the exact
structure of
the Novichok agent.

01:01.195 --> 01:04.465
Pig, hog, runt,

01:04.598 --> 01:06.734
sow,

01:06.867 --> 01:08.902
boar.

01:09.036 --> 01:11.472
My brother's mantra.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.342
When he was a boy,
he collected glass pigs.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.510
He knew everything
there was to know about them.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.313
Which side-group
is this?

01:19.447 --> 01:21.882
Ethoxy.
It's more stable.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.552
Easier to spread.
Harder to detect.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.987
And lethal when
it contacts the skin.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.372
This compound is 10 times
more potent than VX.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.006
If there's a deadlier
nerve agent on Earth,

01:46.140 --> 01:47.875
I'm not aware of it.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.278
Call our buyer
in Durres.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.180
Tell him the order's ready

01:52.313 --> 01:54.348
and to expect delivery
in 48 hours.

01:59.253 --> 02:02.022
Pig, hog, runt,

02:02.156 --> 02:03.891
sow,

02:04.024 --> 02:05.426
boar.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.114
The road not taken.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.582
Beauty school?
Yes.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.285
That young woman's
great passion

02:31.419 --> 02:34.154
that her single father
just can't understand.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.757
It pushes them apart.

02:36.890 --> 02:39.693
But instead of insisting
that she understand <i>him,</i>

02:39.827 --> 02:42.330
he enrolls in beauty school
as well

02:42.463 --> 02:44.965
and learns
to better understand her.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.302
I think you understand
Elizabeth.

02:48.436 --> 02:49.870
Probably more
than you want to.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.374
Well, I'm not her father.

02:54.975 --> 02:58.779
Maybe if I were, I'd want to
understand her even better.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.814
Perhaps she wouldn't be
so determined to kill me.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.155
Morning, Dembe.
Good morning.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.358
Coffee?
Please.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.159
Something smells delicious.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.794
Mmm.
Meat and potato pie.

03:13.927 --> 03:17.331
Dembe brought it back
from Sarajevo.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.133
You should try a slice.

03:20.268 --> 03:23.837
Like all good things,
it's sinfully bad for you.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.205
You said
you had a case?

03:25.339 --> 03:27.541
Yes.
Thanks to Dembe.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.378
He brought home
more than Bosnian burek.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.346
You know that Elizabeth
used an interpreter

03:32.480 --> 03:34.214
to contract
a bounty hunter.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.849
I found him
in Sarajevo.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.218
An effective chap
of ill repute.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.988
Naturally, I assumed
the hunter's bounty was me.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.990
Unfortunately,
I was mistaken.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.759
How is not being a target
unfortunate?

03:45.893 --> 03:47.995
It's unfortunate because
each time I think

03:48.128 --> 03:51.131
Elizabeth won't go
to a darker place, she does.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.200
Elizabeth wanted the bounty
hunter to kill someone else?

03:53.334 --> 03:55.736
Not kill. Find.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.405
Someone she wanted
to work with.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.273
And why is that
so dark?

03:59.407 --> 04:03.444
Because the person
she's working with brokers
chemical weapons.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.580
I don't believe that.
Her name is Mary Bremmer.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.048
I'm not familiar
with that name.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.583
Neither was I.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.085
The bounty hunter was
unable to locate her,

04:12.219 --> 04:14.422
but he put together
a dossier for Elizabeth.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.757
Dembe got a copy of it.
Why would she do this?

04:16.890 --> 04:18.592
The same reason
she worked to get

04:18.726 --> 04:20.861
The Freelancer
released from prison.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.696
You don't know
that she did that.
No.

04:22.830 --> 04:26.967
But I know her endgame,
to break me and then kill me.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.337
I think it's safe to assume
that she's using

04:29.470 --> 04:31.705
The Freelancer
and Chemical Mary

04:31.839 --> 04:33.907
to accomplish that.
You think she's in business

04:34.041 --> 04:36.410
with a mass murderer
and a war criminal?

04:37.711 --> 04:41.415
As I said, it's all,
quite unfortunate.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.285
On the bright side,
I'm going to have a meeting

04:45.419 --> 04:47.721
with The Freelancer's
expensive new attorney.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.290
Word on the street
is that his client's

04:50.424 --> 04:52.626
acquired identity papers,
passports,

04:52.760 --> 04:54.161
and that
he's back to work.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.665
<i>I want to know</i>
what he's doing.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.033
<i>So we'll see what</i>
his attorney has to say.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.069
The dossier on Bremmer.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.738
It's incomplete, but it should
give you a head start.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.948
Not a good time.
I'm doing it now.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.985
But this is it, Agent Keen.

05:18.118 --> 05:21.188
Once your target
is eliminated,
you and I are even.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.300
<i>I think what</i>
you're doing is wrong.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.335
You're only
making things worse
for Keen by pursuing her.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.838
Agent Park,
you can rest assured,

05:37.971 --> 05:40.273
I've heard it all before.

05:40.408 --> 05:43.577
It's a luxury to stand
on the moral high ground

05:43.711 --> 05:46.313
and critique those of us
on the low ground.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.782
A lot of people
do exactly that.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.785
Until they need my help.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.355
I'll never ask
for your help.

05:55.489 --> 05:58.125
Mr. Cooper called with
a heads-up.
We have got a case.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.693
Okay.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.763
Oh. Uh,

06:03.664 --> 06:05.165
is that
about your friend?

06:06.800 --> 06:07.835
I'm so sorry.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.171
Me too.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.541
It, uh, It sounded like
it might have been arson.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.142
Not "might." It was.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.243
Are there suspects?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.016
There was,
but he disappeared.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.218
Have you talked
to Mr. Reddington?

06:25.352 --> 06:27.521
I mean,
he can find <i>anyone,</i>

06:27.655 --> 06:30.023
which, in this case,
it might help, right?

06:30.157 --> 06:31.592
I mean, if he found
the arsonist, you know,

06:31.725 --> 06:35.028
justice, scales, balancing,
that kind of thing.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.230
But then on the downside,
you'd be in his debt,

06:37.364 --> 06:39.332
and, ohh,

06:39.467 --> 06:41.635
that is a record scratch
through your favorite song.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.004
I mean,
can you even imagine?

06:44.137 --> 06:45.906
What was it
you said earlier?

06:46.039 --> 06:47.908
That I'd never ask
for your help.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.543
No, that couldn't be it.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.846
I mean, the irony,
it's crushing.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.517
No.
I can't imagine.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.119
Of course you can't
because this is, like,
horrendous advice,

06:59.252 --> 07:02.222
which you are clearly
way too smart to take.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.891
Anyway,

07:04.024 --> 07:05.693
I'm really sorry
about your friend.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.234
Will you help?

07:14.367 --> 07:17.505
You're asking me
to make it all go away.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.374
Say it.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.877
Make it go away.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.579
And if I do this,
you're aware

07:25.713 --> 07:29.650
I may someday
ask for a favor in return?

07:32.352 --> 07:36.389
You may come to wish you'd
accepted the consequences

07:36.524 --> 07:39.059
of your actions here
instead.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.798
Are we good?

07:44.932 --> 07:46.567
He has a video of me
on his phone.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.901
Ah, ah, ah!

07:48.035 --> 07:49.803
We'll take care of it.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.939
Like you were never here.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.448
Reddington refers
to her as Chemical Mary.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.050
This I.D. is more than
15 years old,

08:03.183 --> 08:04.818
but it's the most recent photo
we have.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.453
What we know is this,
Mary Bremmer

08:06.587 --> 08:09.557
is a former MIT professor
in pathobiological sciences

08:09.690 --> 08:12.225
who was fired for
ethical misconduct in '02.

08:12.359 --> 08:14.027
Apparently she questioned
the appropriateness

08:14.161 --> 08:16.129
of a chemical-weapons ban,
reasoning that if

08:16.263 --> 08:17.998
nuclear weapons are an
acceptable deterrent to war,

08:18.131 --> 08:19.733
why not sarin gas?

08:19.867 --> 08:21.501
There's always a market
for that kind of crazy.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.704
I mean, I assume she's found
a way to monetize it.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.472
Yeah.
The CIA thinks so.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.775
According to Langley,
Bremmer supplied the weaponry

08:27.908 --> 08:29.142
for the chlorine
car-bomb massacre

08:29.276 --> 08:30.778
in the Abu Sayda market.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.946
As for the assassination
of Kim Jong-nam,

08:33.080 --> 08:36.283
Bremmer's role, if any,
is still being investigated.

08:36.416 --> 08:37.985
I know.
It doesn't seem possible.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.553
Well, because
it's <i>not</i> possible.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.521
Agent Keen would never work
with someone like this.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.823
No, <i>Agent</i> Keen wouldn't.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.892
But she's not an agent
anymore, is she?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.727
Yeah, but you don't
know her like we do.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.962
Maybe that's why I can see
what's really going on.

08:49.096 --> 08:52.132
What's going on is hard.
On all of us.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.667
But the only way to find out
what's really happening

08:53.801 --> 08:55.035
is to find Agent Keen.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.837
And right now
finding Mary Bremmer

08:56.970 --> 08:58.839
is our best hope
of doing that.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.574
Okay. Intel

09:00.708 --> 09:04.712
placed Bremmer
in the Idlib Province in 2013,

09:04.845 --> 09:07.147
supplying sarin
to Assad forces.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.917
Now, a NATO operation
intercepted her convoy.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.819
Bremmer's vehicle
was overturned
during the attack.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.320
Now, the shipment was stopped,

09:13.453 --> 09:16.089
but Bremmer escaped
and hasn't been seen since.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.325
Bremmer's entire
security detail was killed,

09:18.458 --> 09:21.795
except for one man,
Ismael Aknoz.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.664
At the time,
Aknoz refused to give

09:23.797 --> 09:25.332
any information on Bremmer,

09:25.465 --> 09:27.400
but after eight years
of isolation

09:27.534 --> 09:31.271
in an F-Type prison in Ankara,
maybe he'll be ready to talk.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.781
Ismael Aknoz? FBI.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.582
We'd like to talk to you
about Mary Bremmer.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.728
Well. This has
been productive.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.229
We know
you speak English.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.732
You want Bremmer.
So do I.

09:58.866 --> 10:01.969
Nothing would
give me more happiness
than to see her dead.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.536
Okay. Great.
You help us find her,

10:03.671 --> 10:04.972
and we'd be happy
to oblige you.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.439
Why do you want
to see her dead?

10:06.573 --> 10:08.108
What difference does it make?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.110
You were her partner.
In her convoy.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.378
Why should we
trust you?

10:11.511 --> 10:13.681
It's her fault I'm here.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.616
Oh, so she <i>forced</i> you to
transport chemical weapons?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.986
We did not know
they were chemical weapons.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.388
She told us we were moving
anti-tank missiles.

10:21.521 --> 10:24.457
So she lied to you, which is
why you're gonna help us.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.426
Thank you. No.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.461
I hate her, yes.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.097
But Americans?

10:31.064 --> 10:32.766
I hate you more.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.902
We knew you spoke English
because our boss

10:35.035 --> 10:36.804
spoke with
the Ministry of Justice.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.772
Now, you work with us,
and they agreed

10:38.906 --> 10:40.207
to move you
out of isolation.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.709
We're offering you a gift.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.277
No matter how much
you hate us,
you should take it.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.351
Your allied forces,

10:51.484 --> 10:53.453
they could have stopped us
that day.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.222
Arrested us, peacefully.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.658
Instead, they set up an ambush
with an IED

10:58.792 --> 11:00.994
and started shooting.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.830
Taking the weapons
wasn't enough.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.265
They wanted to make
an example of us.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.867
And to do that,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.102
they were willing
to slaughter us.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.173
Take your "gift" and go.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.261
Who let you in here?!

11:34.394 --> 11:37.664
Your assistant.
Lovely fellow. Not very savvy.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.667
Probably not best utilized
as the gatekeeper.

11:40.801 --> 11:44.237
Perhaps better suited
to make coffee, chit-chat.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.873
I know who you are.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.941
Tell me, when you go
on a business trip,

11:48.075 --> 11:50.710
do you charge by the hour
while you're on the plane?

11:50.844 --> 11:52.712
Or in the car
to the hotel?

11:52.846 --> 11:55.115
Or how about when
you're enjoying

11:55.248 --> 11:57.517
the adult entertainment
in your room?

11:57.650 --> 12:00.153
Is your client
paying $1,000 an hour

12:00.287 --> 12:03.723
for every hour or minute
that you masturbate?

12:03.857 --> 12:06.860
My goodness. And the world
thinks <i>I'm</i> a criminal.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.863
What do you want?

12:09.997 --> 12:13.066
For Dick the Butcher
to have succeeded.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.668
"Henry IV, Part 2,"
Act IV, scene II.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.370
You've heard it.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.740
"The first thing we do,
let's kill all the lawyers."

12:20.874 --> 12:24.711
You seem like an appropriately
loathsome place to start.

12:24.845 --> 12:28.148
Luckily for you,
I want to know where
Alban Veseli is

12:28.281 --> 12:31.751
more than I want to sully
my hands or reputation

12:31.885 --> 12:35.688
by something so obvious
as disposing of you.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.191
I don't know where he is.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.427
But you know
how to contact him.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.495
If I do that, how do I know
you won't kill me?

12:42.629 --> 12:45.565
Because you still have
a debt to repay.

12:45.698 --> 12:48.902
Elizabeth Keen paid you
to represent Veseli

12:49.036 --> 12:51.571
with money
she stole from me.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.740
I want it back.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.775
You want me to give you back
my retainer.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.846
Plus interest.
There's the phone.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.781
Tell Alban his life
is in imminent danger,

13:01.915 --> 13:05.552
that you can't discuss it over
the phone, and set a meeting.

13:05.685 --> 13:08.488
I think this qualifies
as an emergency,

13:08.621 --> 13:10.123
wouldn't you say, Scooter?

13:13.493 --> 13:15.262
Look, I know
we're jet-lagged, so maybe

13:15.395 --> 13:17.597
we're not making ourselves
clear. Aknoz was a dead end.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.399
No, I know
he didn't say anything.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.234
So what part of "dead end"
don't you understand?

13:21.368 --> 13:22.735
He may not
have <i>said</i> anything,

13:22.870 --> 13:24.972
but I think
he <i>told</i> you a lot.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.174
-You have something?
-I've been studying the photos

13:27.307 --> 13:29.209
in the dossier that
Mr. Reddington gave us.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.411
The bodies in the lead Humvee
from the convoy,

13:31.544 --> 13:33.080
what do they all
have in common?

13:33.213 --> 13:34.347
Other than being
really dead.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.615
Well, they're all burned.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.450
<i>You said Aknoz was, too.</i>

13:37.584 --> 13:39.652
<i>That's what</i>
<i>he told us.</i>
He was disfigured.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.588
Chemical burns?
No.

13:41.721 --> 13:44.224
I think there may have been
an incendiary in the IED.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.994
That Humvee burned
like a bonfire.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.196
<i>And Bremmer only escaped</i>
after the explosion.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.530
<i>If everyone else</i>
was burned,

13:50.663 --> 13:52.665
<i>it stands to reason</i>
that she was, too.

13:52.799 --> 13:55.435
If so, she couldn't have
gotten far without
any medical help.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.337
Maybe burns like that
will lead to hypovolemic shock

13:57.470 --> 13:59.239
<i>without timely</i>
medical intervention.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.508
<i>It is a life-threatening</i>
condition.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.276
<i>Any legitimate</i>
physician giving her aid

14:03.410 --> 14:04.978
<i>would have turned her over</i>
to the authorities.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.280
<i>So she found help</i>
outside the established

14:07.414 --> 14:09.782
medical community.
Dirtbag doctors
without borders.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.351
Sounds like a job
for Reddington.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.186
<i>Reach out to him,</i>
see if he has

14:13.320 --> 14:15.655
<i>a medical contact</i>
who knows the area.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.290
Sir. The flash drive
that you gave me?

14:17.424 --> 14:18.825
I got it back from
my friend at the NSA.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.560
Did he figure out
the passcode?

14:20.693 --> 14:23.263
Please. He's not, He's not
that much smarter than me.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.865
I mean, sure he knows pi
out two more places,

14:25.999 --> 14:27.667
but should
one quinquadragintillion

14:27.800 --> 14:30.337
really determine who
has to buy the hot wings
on bridge night?

14:30.470 --> 14:32.505
I don't think so.
So he couldn't open it?

14:32.639 --> 14:34.541
Uh, sorry.
Not technically, no.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.709
He couldn't read the data,
but he was able to use

14:36.843 --> 14:39.712
a USB traffic sniffer
to see the operation commands

14:39.846 --> 14:42.315
which bear the signature
of a known hacker.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.484
She goes by the name
of Rakitin.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.686
And when I say, uh, "she,"
I don't mean she's a woman.

14:46.819 --> 14:49.156
I mean, she could be.
or a man.

14:49.289 --> 14:52.092
I'm trying to alternative
pronouns instead of defaulting
to the generic "he"

14:52.225 --> 14:54.327
to represent
a man or a woman.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.796
Rakitin could be
a he or a she.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.331
Or a they.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.667
This is good.
We know who the hacker is,

15:00.800 --> 15:02.702
but we still need
to find out what he,

15:02.835 --> 15:04.804
or she, hacked.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.873
And we won't know that
until you crack the passcode.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.408
Right. I'm on it.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.810
Tell your NSA friend
he did good work.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.746
And buy hot wings
for the month?
Yeah, I don't think so.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.717
And they know
to call us right away?

15:17.850 --> 15:19.386
Yes. They do.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.621
The minute The Freelancer
sets foot on U.S. soil,

15:21.754 --> 15:23.056
we'll know.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.757
Good morning!

15:24.891 --> 15:26.426
Would you please tell
Dr. Grundig

15:26.559 --> 15:28.561
that Lloyd Wilke is here?

15:28.695 --> 15:30.197
Uh, do you have
an appointment?

15:30.330 --> 15:33.366
Mine is a lifetime
appointment.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.238
Ah!

15:38.371 --> 15:40.540
What a pleasant surprise.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.943
Quite the environment
you've created here, Mickey.

15:44.077 --> 15:47.580
I can't tell if I'm in
a waiting room
or a gentlemen's club.

15:47.714 --> 15:52.385
My mouth is
positively watering
for a smokey single-malt

15:52.519 --> 15:55.388
and a smooth-draw
Tatuaje Fausto.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.557
Well, a good first impression
is imperative

15:57.690 --> 16:00.460
to setting the tone for
a satisfied
patient experience.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.729
Hah! My goodness.
How far you've come.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.931
You know they used to
call Mickey here

16:05.065 --> 16:06.566
the Back-Room Butcher?

16:06.699 --> 16:08.735
If there was
a cash payment involved,

16:08.868 --> 16:10.770
he'd operate,
no questions asked.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.939
Colleen, the break room could
use a fresh pot of coffee.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.308
You mind?

16:15.442 --> 16:17.477
There wasn't a medical
procedure in the book

16:17.610 --> 16:20.813
you wouldn't perform,
or at least try to.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.949
Of course that was <i>after</i>
they stripped your license.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.484
Cocaine, was it?

16:24.617 --> 16:26.786
But you kicked that
and saved up enough

16:26.919 --> 16:30.423
to buy a brand-new identity
from me and look at you now!

16:30.557 --> 16:32.425
Raymond. Please.
If any of this ever got out,

16:32.559 --> 16:34.761
Well, it doesn't have to.
Listen.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.430
I'm looking for a woman
named Mary Bremmer.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.832
Three years ago,
she had a mishap

16:39.966 --> 16:42.001
near the Syrian-Turkish
border.

16:42.135 --> 16:45.172
Suffered terrible burns
requiring the kind of

16:45.305 --> 16:48.175
discrete medical care
you once provided.

16:48.308 --> 16:52.079
I don't know her.
But I suspect you may know
the sawbones who treated her.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.013
You want me to sell out
another doctor?

16:54.147 --> 16:56.216
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

16:56.349 --> 16:58.818
the patient trades
in chemical weapons.

16:58.951 --> 17:02.189
She's a scourge
on the human race.

17:02.322 --> 17:05.192
Help me find her,
and your past,

17:05.325 --> 17:07.094
remains in the past.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.400
I require a demonstration
before I commit

17:13.533 --> 17:15.635
such significant resources.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.204
I hope you don't mind.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.672
Not at all.
I expected as much.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.008
If, uh, one of your men

17:22.142 --> 17:25.145
would retrieve the briefcase
in my trunk?

17:34.121 --> 17:36.055
Bujare.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.457
What is wrong?

17:39.326 --> 17:41.294
You asked for
a demonstration.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.698
I'm giving you one.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.444
Thanks to Mr. Reddington,
we got the identity

17:57.577 --> 17:58.778
of the physician
who treated Mary Bremmer.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.780
Yeah, but in Turkey.
It's gonna take us months

18:00.913 --> 18:02.249
to obtain a search
and seizure there.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.850
Given that his
records may hold the key

18:03.983 --> 18:05.852
to our tracking a purveyor
of banned weapons,

18:05.985 --> 18:07.387
Main Justice
authorized a shortcut

18:07.520 --> 18:09.356
by working with
Turkish intelligence.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.524
Hacking his medical records.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.860
So you were right.
She was burned in the Humvee.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.395
Badly enough to require
multiple skin grafts

18:15.528 --> 18:17.564
as well as
personalized prosthetics.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.699
Now, these photos were
taken within a few days
of the incident.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.602
But these,
were taken a year later.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.571
No wonder
we couldn't find her.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.839
We ran her
current looks through
the Interpol database.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.275
What did it kick back?

18:28.408 --> 18:30.743
A single touch
or an inhaled droplet

18:30.877 --> 18:32.645
disrupts the nerve signals

18:32.779 --> 18:36.115
to his muscles,
his heart, and lungs.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.350
In a matter of seconds,

18:37.484 --> 18:40.253
breathing will not
be option.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.054
Six nationalities.
Six aliases.

18:42.189 --> 18:45.057
All active,
but according to
passport-control archives,

18:45.192 --> 18:47.494
the last one she used
was yesterday.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.463
In Paris.
Madeline Toussaint.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.400
Remarkable.
The delivery system?

18:53.533 --> 18:56.035
One drop on the key fob
was all it took.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.104
Odorless, invisible.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.907
Lasts for days
on any hard surface.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.743
Or load it into a crop duster
and take out a town.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.478
It's up to you.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.780
Killing's
never been easier.

19:07.914 --> 19:11.117
For the last nine months,
Mary Bremmer's been living
as Madeline Toussaint

19:11.251 --> 19:13.152
in the Batignolles district
of Paris.

19:13.286 --> 19:16.623
She has a cover job
as a quality engineer
at a chemical plant.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.825
Contact Interpol.
Have them issue a Red Notice

19:18.958 --> 19:20.527
for Bremmer's conditional
arrest and extradition

19:20.660 --> 19:21.794
based on our charges.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.463
Then let's get a team
to Paris.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.164
I'll go to Paris.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.767
I need your help with that
passcode.
I could look for it in Paris.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.837
You know, sidewalk cafe,
pot of coffee,
couple'a croissants.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.606
I'm on my way to Capitol Hill
to ask about Rakitin.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.875
I doubt I'll get much traction
until you find out

19:36.008 --> 19:38.845
what's on that drive.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.780
I guess that's a no
on that coffee and croissants.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.483
We'll say hi to Mona Lisa
for you.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.889
Thank you for
taking the time, Congressman.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.325
Always happy to make time
for the FBI.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.793
Though I am surprised
there was no heads-up

19:53.926 --> 19:55.828
what you wanted to talk about.
Please, sit.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.965
Take a load off and tell me
what is so hush-hush

19:59.098 --> 20:01.801
I get an Assistant Director
to make a house call.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.704
A hacker who goes
by the name Rakitin.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.138
Never heard of him.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.974
Excuse me?
Anything else?

20:08.107 --> 20:10.009
Because I got
a local Elks Club
waiting to take a photo.

20:10.142 --> 20:12.845
Congressman. You chair
the House Intel Committee.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.715
I've read your report
on Russian cyber intrusion.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.850
I know you know
who Rakitin is.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.887
What I know is your title.

20:21.020 --> 20:24.657
What I don't know is
what you do because
no one would tell me.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.893
Yeah, I chair
the Intel Committee,

20:27.026 --> 20:29.296
but for some reason,
I can't get any intel on <i>you.</i>

20:29.429 --> 20:31.063
I run a classified
task force.

20:31.197 --> 20:34.033
That's interested in Rakitin.
Why would that surprise you?

20:34.166 --> 20:35.935
I doesn't.
It troubles me.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.170
Rakitin has friends
in high places.

20:38.305 --> 20:40.273
I want to make sure
I'm not talking to one.

20:41.374 --> 20:44.010
I'm sorry. I'm,
I'm completely confused.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.513
Three weeks ago,
the hard drive

20:46.646 --> 20:49.015
on my committee's computer
was hacked.

20:49.148 --> 20:51.050
All the intel we had
on Rakitin was destroyed.

20:51.183 --> 20:53.620
I had no idea.
My top staffer
on the committee

20:53.753 --> 20:55.422
disappeared the day it happened.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.189
Vanished into thin air.

20:57.324 --> 21:00.059
And she was a patriot.
A good person.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.861
But someone got to her.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.030
And if they got to her,
maybe they got to you.

21:04.163 --> 21:07.233
Maybe you're here to see
what I know about Rakitin,

21:07.367 --> 21:09.101
and if I know too much,

21:09.235 --> 21:11.404
maybe you're gonna want
to erase <i>my</i> hard drive.

21:11.538 --> 21:15.274
Here's a name and a number.
Call it. Ask about me.

21:15.408 --> 21:19.646
If you're satisfied with what
you hear, we can talk more.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.949
If not, thank you
for your time.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.251
I'm sure it seems like
I'm being overly paranoid.

21:25.385 --> 21:28.120
If we do talk, I'd like to
hear more about that hack.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.922
I have some paranoia
of my own

21:30.056 --> 21:32.525
about who might
have been behind it.

21:32.659 --> 21:35.428
Rogelio.
I hear you have news.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.897
A location,
and a room number.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.832
Ah.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.134
A youth hostel.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.437
How unexpectedly romantic.

21:44.571 --> 21:47.206
Is there anywhere you
don't have eyes and ears?

21:47.340 --> 21:50.477
I got either a maid, a waiter,
a waitress, a busboy,

21:50.610 --> 21:52.345
or a bellhop
in every corner of the city.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.780
Thank you, my friend.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.315
And please give my regards
to Carlos.

21:56.449 --> 22:00.086
Unfortunately,
he's been deported, again.

22:00.219 --> 22:02.555
And your friend's tunnel in
Calexico has been shut down.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.392
Ah, the goings-on
at the border.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.860
One side builds,
the other shuts down.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.496
They hide, they seek,
they come, they go.

22:09.629 --> 22:12.331
It's all so,
"Tom and Jerry."

22:12.465 --> 22:14.100
Yes, the tunnel
is closed,

22:14.233 --> 22:15.935
but the submarine
is fully operational.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.337
And for tracking down
Alban Veseli,

22:18.471 --> 22:20.773
it will always be
at your disposal.

22:29.248 --> 22:31.784
I once had
a brief dust-up
with an Armenian fellow

22:31.918 --> 22:33.520
who took umbrage
at my acquisition

22:33.653 --> 22:36.789
of a pipeline
outside Kajaran.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.892
I tried to avoid him
by hiding out in a hostel.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.361
You "tried."
Did he find you?
No.

22:42.495 --> 22:46.533
But after three days
of communal showers
and curdled yogurt,

22:46.666 --> 22:49.602
James Taylor wannabes,
I couldn't stand it anymore.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.938
So I stole a backpack
and a <i>Fodor's Guide</i>

22:52.071 --> 22:54.541
and hiked to Turkey through
the Armenian Highlands.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.743
The Highlands.
Mount Ararat.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.211
Yes.
And FYI, no Ark.

23:02.314 --> 23:04.383
Ah. Some things
never change.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.824
No cameras. No security.
Smart place to lay low.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.538
Not here.

23:28.541 --> 23:31.243
Ah!

23:31.377 --> 23:33.813
Running in a towel
never ends well.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.848
Put some pants on,
and let's talk.

23:42.489 --> 23:44.691
I did
as you suggested, Mr. Cooper.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.759
Checked up on you
with Cynthia Panabaker.

23:46.893 --> 23:49.028
A straight arrow
if ever there was one.

23:49.161 --> 23:50.997
She likes you.
Does she, now?

23:51.130 --> 23:52.999
Well, she said,
"He won't pee on your leg

23:53.132 --> 23:54.701
and tell you
it's rainin'."

23:54.834 --> 23:56.969
Sounds like Cynthia.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.871
You said before
that you were looking

23:59.005 --> 24:01.440
for information
about Rakitin.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.676
I'm curious
what your committee
knows about him.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.411
Not a hell of a lot,
to be honest.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.413
We don't have an I.D.

24:07.547 --> 24:10.416
Hell, Rakitin could be
an entire hacker group
for all we know.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.419
But he's using a series
of servers in Volgograd,

24:13.553 --> 24:16.288
and he is targeting
some of our most
carefully guarded secrets.

24:16.422 --> 24:18.491
Such as,?
The identities

24:18.625 --> 24:21.093
of CIA assets
in Yasenevo,

24:21.227 --> 24:22.695
their funding sources,

24:22.829 --> 24:24.797
hacks of our own internal
threat assessments.

24:24.931 --> 24:26.666
What does he do
with this intel?

24:26.799 --> 24:28.267
There are a lot
of theories.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.737
NSA thinks he's
a black-market profiteer.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.639
CIA's convinced
he's a turncoat.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.574
And what do you think?

24:35.675 --> 24:38.210
Have you ever heard
of N-13?

24:38.344 --> 24:40.046
Sleeper agent.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.914
A Russian asset who vanished
during the Cold War

24:42.048 --> 24:43.750
and was never proven
to exist.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.518
It's a 30-year-old
ghost story.

24:46.385 --> 24:47.920
What if it's not?

24:49.656 --> 24:52.925
What if that asset
is here?

24:53.059 --> 24:55.728
Not only active
and deeply embedded,

24:55.862 --> 24:59.131
but maneuvering
within our intel community?

24:59.265 --> 25:01.634
I don't know whose trust
he might have gained,

25:01.768 --> 25:04.704
CIA, Defense Intelligence,
God forbid, the FBI.

25:04.837 --> 25:08.407
But I think he's been here
a long time.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.510
Long enough,
he's become one of us.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.345
And he's <i>using</i> us.

25:13.479 --> 25:16.048
You think Rakitin's feeding
active intel to N-13.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.717
I do.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.218
I think I'm the only man
on this hill

25:19.351 --> 25:22.855
who may believe
your ghost story
about a Russian spy.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.523
Go on.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.492
We've recently intercepted
a thumb drive

25:26.626 --> 25:27.760
containing sensitive intel

25:27.894 --> 25:29.996
we believe
was obtained by Rakitin.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.464
I suspect he intended to
deliver that drive to N-13.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.166
Why do you say that?

25:34.300 --> 25:37.870
Did anything on the drive
identify N-13?

25:38.004 --> 25:40.039
All I can say is our source
believes it was intended

25:40.172 --> 25:42.374
for someone
on our Most Wanted List.

25:42.508 --> 25:44.844
Well, whoever your source is,
he or she is way off base.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.079
I'm telling you,
N-13 is buried

25:47.213 --> 25:49.582
deep within
the U.S. government.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.719
That said,
I strongly encourage
you to follow up on it.

25:52.852 --> 25:55.021
Based on what I know
of Rakitin,

25:55.154 --> 25:58.991
he and N-13 pose an imminent
threat to national security.

26:02.895 --> 26:06.198
I must admit I'm surprised
you took this contract, Alban.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.534
I'd never pretend
to call us friends,

26:08.668 --> 26:10.569
but we are
professional associates.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.504
It's a job.

26:12.639 --> 26:15.374
Unbridled resentment. Is that
what this is all about?

26:15.507 --> 26:18.044
You somehow blame me
for you going to prison.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.747
You <i>are</i> why
I went to prison.
No.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.349
You went to prison because
you were caught doing a job

26:23.482 --> 26:25.251
I hired you to do.

26:25.384 --> 26:27.754
Don't blame me for your
failed cut-and-run.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.389
I've been in that box
for seven years.

26:30.522 --> 26:33.926
And now you're out.
Because of Elizabeth Keen.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.228
That <i>is</i> why you're aligned
with her, isn't it?

26:36.362 --> 26:38.197
You bear me resentment
for your failure,

26:38.330 --> 26:40.199
and now you both
want me dead?

26:40.332 --> 26:42.234
What's he
so worked up about?

26:42.368 --> 26:45.838
Talk to me about Agent Keen.
Tell me where I can find her.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.406
No idea.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.241
Raymond.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.885
You just flew in from Paris.
What were you doing there?

26:59.018 --> 27:01.387
Taking a tour of
the Temple de l'Amour?

27:01.520 --> 27:03.823
Strolling along
the Canal Saint-Martin?

27:03.956 --> 27:07.393
What do you think?
I was setting up the job.

27:07.526 --> 27:10.462
I have no plans
to be in France.
So?

27:10.596 --> 27:13.465
So how were you going to
carry out your contract?

27:13.599 --> 27:16.035
What's wrong with him?
How were you going to kill me?

27:16.168 --> 27:19.471
The contract's not on you.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.342
Who were you hired
to kill?

27:25.945 --> 27:27.246
Madeline Toussaint.

27:27.379 --> 27:29.648
At least that's the name
she's using right now.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.784
This is the address
she gave her current employer.

27:31.918 --> 27:34.153
If she's here,
we're gonna have to make
the provisional arrest.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.755
You can file for
extradition afterward.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.924
We're just here
for backup.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.389
Where is she?

28:14.393 --> 28:16.763
She's visiting an aunt
in Albania. She'll be
back later today.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.004
Gun!

28:29.776 --> 28:31.210
Hang on. We'll get help.

28:35.782 --> 28:38.350
She's dead.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.753
You know how much I love
I told you so, Harold,

28:40.887 --> 28:43.255
so I confirmed the fact
straight from the source.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.124
Elizabeth sprung
The Freelancer

28:45.257 --> 28:46.558
so she could engage
his services.

28:46.692 --> 28:48.360
<i>I refuse</i>
to believe that.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.529
Alban Veseli cloaks
assassination in mass murder.

28:50.662 --> 28:52.531
I don't care
how far she's slipped,

28:52.664 --> 28:54.867
Agent Keen would never use
The Freelancer to kill you.

28:55.001 --> 28:57.203
You're half-right. She didn't
hire him to kill me.

28:57.336 --> 29:00.072
She hired him
to kill Chemical Mary.

29:00.206 --> 29:02.341
Mary Bremmer. Why?
I'm not sure.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.911
I'm hoping
a slightly more creative

29:05.044 --> 29:08.680
line of questioning will
persuade him to
reveal his plan.

29:08.815 --> 29:12.351
But one thing is clear,
it's already in motion.

29:12.484 --> 29:15.187
<i>Ressler's at Bremmer's</i>
residence in Paris now.

29:15.321 --> 29:17.556
<i>She's apparently flying back</i>
from Albania today.

29:17.689 --> 29:20.392
<i>A transcontinental flight</i>
<i>filled with</i>
innocent passengers?

29:20.526 --> 29:21.861
<i>We're contacting</i>
the airlines now.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.407
<i>Merci!</i>

29:35.541 --> 29:37.209
<i>Move swiftly, Harold.</i>

29:37.343 --> 29:39.211
If Mary Bremmer
boards that plane,

29:39.345 --> 29:41.247
<i>I'll bet you</i>
nickels to navy beans

29:41.380 --> 29:43.883
the only way it comes down
is in pieces.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.456
<i>We got a hit on one</i>
of Bremmer's passports.

29:50.589 --> 29:53.392
<i>She's currently en route</i>
to France on Parisian Air.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.227
Okay, we're 10 minutes
from Charles de Gaulle

29:55.361 --> 29:57.063
How long before she lands?
About a half an hour,

29:57.196 --> 29:59.265
but we have to assume
that plane won't land.

29:59.398 --> 30:02.434
There are 162 passengers
on board, including families.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.070
<i>And he'll kill everyone.</i>
Wait.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.737
I thought The Freelancer
was going after Reddington.

30:05.872 --> 30:07.239
<i>That's what we all thought.</i>

30:07.373 --> 30:08.407
Alright. The airline's
confirming that Bremmer's

30:08.540 --> 30:10.076
on the boarded-passenger
manifest.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.078
So Keen's taking out
a chemical arms trader,

30:12.211 --> 30:15.814
air hugs for that, but she's
gonna waste a plane full of
passengers in the process?

30:15.948 --> 30:18.217
<i>Have the airport authority</i>
prepare for contingencies,

30:18.350 --> 30:20.386
rescue units, medics.
You know the routine.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.088
Okay. Thank you.
Uh, I've got the tower.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.422
I've got air-traffic control
on the line.

30:23.555 --> 30:24.756
Call me
when you're on site.

30:24.891 --> 30:26.325
Copy that.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.294
Hello.
This is Harold Cooper.

30:28.427 --> 30:31.663
<i>I'm the Assistant Director</i>
<i>of the FBI calling from</i>
Washington, D.C.

30:31.797 --> 30:34.466
Stephan Gervais.
ATC Supervisor.
What's going on?

30:34.600 --> 30:35.968
We have a credible threat
that someone's trying

30:36.102 --> 30:38.637
to bring down
Parisian Air flight 2419.

30:38.770 --> 30:41.273
Really? How?
<i>Well, we don't know</i>
that yet, Stephan.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.109
<i>We need your help</i>
figuring it out.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.011
Parisian Air 2-4-1 niner.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.445
<i>Are you currently experiencing</i>

30:46.578 --> 30:49.415
<i>any problems</i>
or equipment malfunctions?

30:49.548 --> 30:52.751
Negative, Tower. Everything is
showing normal at this time.

30:52.885 --> 30:55.154
<i>Anything unusual show up</i>
in your preflight checklist?

30:55.287 --> 30:57.056
<i>Nothing.</i>
May I ask why?

30:57.189 --> 31:01.127
Switch to discrete
frequency 133.6.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.361
What do you want me
to tell them?

31:02.494 --> 31:04.096
Should they be
looking for a bomb?

31:04.230 --> 31:07.266
Suspect engages
in terrorist activities
disguised as accidents.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.867
It's doubtful
he'd use explosives.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.502
Okay, he was physically
on that plane.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.504
Airport security has footage
of him entering the cabin

31:12.638 --> 31:14.306
along with
the cleaning crew.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.309
Tower, is there anything
we should be worried about
up here?

31:17.443 --> 31:19.011
We've just begun
our descent.

31:19.145 --> 31:20.479
Stand by. One moment.

31:20.612 --> 31:22.014
<i>They just started</i>
their descent.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.316
The instrument panel.
What about it?

31:26.252 --> 31:28.487
Seven years ago, Veseli
derailed a passenger trail

31:28.620 --> 31:31.657
by making it hit
a curve too fast.

31:36.828 --> 31:38.830
Clear! Clear out!

31:41.767 --> 31:44.403
He did that by rigging
the two speed-data sources

31:44.536 --> 31:46.872
in the control cabin
to show the train traveling

31:47.006 --> 31:49.041
at a slower speed
than its actual rate.

31:49.175 --> 31:51.978
Can your pilots check their
controls for signs
of tampering?

31:52.111 --> 31:54.246
Parisian Air 2-4-1 niner,
it's possible

31:54.380 --> 31:56.648
your flight controls have been
physically compromised.

31:56.782 --> 31:58.684
Can you take
a careful look around?

31:58.817 --> 32:00.352
Roger. Stand by, Tower.

32:16.002 --> 32:17.970
There is a thumb drive here.
We got something.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.973
Someone left a thumb drive
inside the Data Loader.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.874
There's a panel
inside the cockpit

32:23.009 --> 32:24.710
for software
and database updates.

32:24.843 --> 32:26.378
Someone left
a thumb drive inside.

32:26.512 --> 32:28.180
Which could be corrupting
their instruments

32:28.314 --> 32:30.749
or running
its own scripts.

32:30.882 --> 32:33.785
Oh, no.
You said the plane's
making its approach.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.954
<i>Are your tracking systems</i>
showing anything unusual?

32:36.088 --> 32:37.956
Our GPS system is based
entirely on information

32:38.090 --> 32:39.925
transmitted to us
from the aircraft.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.760
If that plane isn't where
it should be right now,

32:41.893 --> 32:43.395
we would not know it
from down here.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.397
Okay, that data stick
wasn't left there by accident.

32:45.531 --> 32:48.500
It is a brute-force attack.
Take it out! Take it out now!

32:48.634 --> 32:50.136
Parisian Air 2-4-1 niner.

32:50.269 --> 32:51.903
Remove the drive
from the Data Loader.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.472
<i>I repeat! Remove the drive!</i>

32:53.605 --> 32:56.108
Copy, Tower.

32:57.876 --> 32:59.145
<i>Warning.</i>

32:59.278 --> 33:00.546
<i>Warning.</i>

33:04.316 --> 33:06.085
<i>Warning.</i>
Autopilot off!

33:06.218 --> 33:08.420
Flight directors off.

33:20.132 --> 33:22.534
What's going on?

33:22.668 --> 33:24.170
They're too low.
Immediate right turn!

33:24.303 --> 33:26.172
<i>Heading 2-3-zero!</i>

33:26.305 --> 33:28.006
<i>Traffic is directly</i>
in front of you!

33:28.140 --> 33:29.441
I have control!

33:44.790 --> 33:46.958
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
I'm terribly sorry

33:47.093 --> 33:49.061
<i>for that sudden shift</i>
in altitude.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.029
<i>We obviously had an incident,</i>

33:51.163 --> 33:54.032
<i>but we are safe and on course</i>
and will be landing shortly.

34:03.642 --> 34:06.112
What's happening?!
Uh, are, are they dying?

34:06.245 --> 34:07.546
No, sir.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.648
I believe those are
cries of celebration.

34:10.782 --> 34:13.852
Tower.
Parisian Air 2-4-1 niner.

34:13.985 --> 34:16.855
We are clear of the traffic
and climbing to 8,000.

34:16.988 --> 34:19.858
<i>We will be begin</i>
our approach for landing.

34:37.943 --> 34:40.646
Excuse me.
A passenger. Mary Bremmer?

34:40.779 --> 34:42.714
Oh, that's it.
That's everyone.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.850
Are you sure?
Feel free to take a look,

34:44.983 --> 34:46.485
but I checked the cabins
personally.

34:46.618 --> 34:47.886
There's no one left
on the plane.

34:55.861 --> 34:57.629
Mary Bremmer
was never on that plane.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.265
She made it
to the airport,

34:59.398 --> 35:01.300
but she was abducted
outside the terminal.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.904
What about
the passenger manifest?

35:06.037 --> 35:07.839
You said it showed her
on board.

35:07.973 --> 35:09.675
Shortly after
Bremmer was taken,

35:09.808 --> 35:12.043
an unidentified woman
entered the terminal

35:12.178 --> 35:14.913
with her passport and ticket,
which was slipped into
the purse

35:15.046 --> 35:17.549
of an unsuspecting passenger
at the gate.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.618
The unidentified woman
then left the terminal,

35:19.751 --> 35:21.987
and the passenger boarded
the flight as Bremmer.

35:24.690 --> 35:27.826
This "unidentified woman."
She look familiar to you?

35:27.959 --> 35:31.163
These are the best images
we could pull, but, yes,

35:31.297 --> 35:33.299
we believe it's Keen.

35:33.432 --> 35:37.703
So, Elizabeth conducted
an operatic performance,

35:37.836 --> 35:40.406
getting an assassin
out of prison,

35:40.539 --> 35:43.709
elaborately sabotaging
a commercial airliner,

35:43.842 --> 35:46.945
only to snatch her target
from the jaws of death

35:47.078 --> 35:49.415
at the last second?

35:49.548 --> 35:51.317
Perhaps she wanted
the world to believe

35:51.450 --> 35:53.151
Bremmer died
in that crash.

35:53.285 --> 35:56.322
To what end?

35:56.455 --> 35:58.924
I can't fathom.

35:59.057 --> 36:01.159
It's more likely
Elizabeth wanted

36:01.293 --> 36:03.795
Bremmer to <i>think</i>
she saved her life,

36:03.929 --> 36:06.164
which would put Bremmer
in Elizabeth's debt.

36:06.298 --> 36:09.435
Whatever they're working on,
we're gonna make it
as difficult as possible.

36:09.568 --> 36:12.338
Our people are combing through
Bremmer's flat in Paris

36:12.471 --> 36:14.573
and have ID'd
a number of associates.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.007
Teams are en route
as we speak.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.645
I still can't get over
the fact that Elizabeth

36:19.778 --> 36:22.281
was willing to let
The Freelancer
crash two planes.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.152
I was holding out hope
for her. We all were.

36:27.286 --> 36:31.457
But now? It seems she's past
the point of no return.

36:32.258 --> 36:34.360
FBI!
Turn around!

36:34.493 --> 36:35.827
Give me your hands!

36:35.961 --> 36:38.029
<i>** And the flames keep rising</i>

36:38.163 --> 36:41.600
I'll try to leave the
moralizing to you, Harold.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.769
<i>** Ash and smoke</i>
choke the horizon

36:43.902 --> 36:47.205
In the meantime, perhaps
this will ease your pain.

36:48.740 --> 36:51.209
Tell Donald to pay a visit
to this address.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.545
What is this?

36:53.679 --> 36:55.547
Your team worked
very hard to put

36:55.681 --> 36:59.485
The Freelancer behind bars
the first time around.

36:59.618 --> 37:02.187
I think that's probably
the right place for him.

37:02.321 --> 37:05.657
<i>** Caught up in my old lies</i>

37:07.793 --> 37:09.428
<i>** It's a long way down</i>

37:09.561 --> 37:11.297
Thank you for the Scotch.

37:12.130 --> 37:15.066
<i>** It's a long way down</i>

37:21.440 --> 37:24.175
<i>** It's a long way down</i>

37:27.979 --> 37:30.215
Whoa, whoa. Easy, brah.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.718
The man in the hat
said the popo would be here.

37:33.885 --> 37:38.056
<i>** It's a long way down **</i>

37:38.189 --> 37:40.292
Why does this feel like
an empty victory?

37:40.426 --> 37:41.860
Because this guy
has no idea

37:41.993 --> 37:43.929
what Keen's up to
with Chemical Mary.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.098
Open this door
right now!

37:47.232 --> 37:48.834
I want to see her!

37:48.967 --> 37:52.504
Where is she?! The woman!

37:52.638 --> 37:54.873
I want to talk to her!

37:55.006 --> 37:56.575
Do you hear me?!

37:56.708 --> 37:59.277
Ugh!

37:59.411 --> 38:02.714
Open this door right now!
I want to see her!

38:08.119 --> 38:10.722
Angela is the one
you were asking about.

38:10.856 --> 38:13.759
She's the one who told me
that Veseli was at the hostel.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.127
Angela, I can't
thank you enough.

38:16.261 --> 38:18.129
I just have one question.

38:18.263 --> 38:22.233
I need to know how you came
by this valuable information.

38:26.605 --> 38:27.973
It was,

38:28.106 --> 38:30.241
a woman.

38:30.376 --> 38:32.243
This woman?

38:32.378 --> 38:34.145
Ah.

38:34.279 --> 38:36.448
I, uh, asked her

38:36.582 --> 38:39.284
how she know that
I was looking for him.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.152
She wouldn't say.

38:41.286 --> 38:42.754
<i>Gracias.</i>

38:45.557 --> 38:47.493
Oh, and your cousin Carlos.

38:47.626 --> 38:50.729
I'm told he's somewhere
under the Gulf of Mexico
as we speak.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.664
<i>Muchas gracias,</i> Raymond.

38:52.798 --> 38:54.299
If there's anything
I can do for you,

38:54.433 --> 38:56.768
You've done more
than you know.
And all to the good.

39:00.572 --> 39:03.274
Well, that's a load off.

39:03.409 --> 39:05.644
Elizabeth wanted you
to find The Freelancer.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.345
Yeah.

39:07.479 --> 39:09.648
Knowing that when we did,
we'd work with the FBI

39:09.781 --> 39:12.150
to stop him from
crashing that plane.

39:12.283 --> 39:15.654
So she hires a lawyer
to obtain Veseli's freedom,

39:15.787 --> 39:18.189
pays Veseli
to crash a plane,

39:18.323 --> 39:21.593
uses the threat of that crash
to gain Chemical Mary's trust,

39:21.727 --> 39:24.796
gives us intel to keep
the plane from going down.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.465
Sounds like
one of <i>your</i> plans.

39:26.598 --> 39:27.966
It doesn't, doesn't it?

39:28.099 --> 39:31.036
She may not be interested
in crash a plane,

39:31.169 --> 39:33.204
but she's still in business
with a war criminal.

39:33.338 --> 39:34.740
Tomorrow's problem.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.975
Tonight, we savor
the small victory.

39:37.108 --> 39:39.978
And we should tell Edward
to fuel the jet.

39:40.111 --> 39:43.014
We need to pay our friend
in Moscow a visit.

39:47.118 --> 39:49.655
Uh, hi.
Um, sir, uh, sorry to,

39:49.788 --> 39:53.024
It's, uh, late, and, uh,
you're drinking, alone,

39:53.158 --> 39:54.993
uh, which is, which is, fine.
I mean, I can,

39:55.126 --> 39:56.728
What is it?

39:56.862 --> 39:58.964
Good news on the passcode.
You cracked it.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.732
What? Oh, uh, no.

40:00.866 --> 40:03.435
Uh, that would be great news,
like miraculously great.

40:03.569 --> 40:06.838
No. Uh, the good news is
I figured out <i>how</i> to crack it.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.607
With this.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.576
I don't think Rakitin chose
a steel flash drive

40:10.709 --> 40:12.210
to protect his software.

40:12.343 --> 40:13.945
If I'm right, there's
a capacitive scanner

40:14.079 --> 40:15.681
hidden in the flash drive.

40:15.814 --> 40:18.550
It is the best security
platform in passwordless
identification.

40:18.684 --> 40:20.351
So there's no password.

40:20.486 --> 40:23.822
It's biometric. And that
is where <i>this</i> comes in.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.691
Get the print,
put it in, and,

40:25.824 --> 40:27.493
,open sesame.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.194
Or, um, you know,
some less

40:29.327 --> 40:31.429
politically incorrect
exclamation.

40:31.563 --> 40:33.932
So all I need
is a fingerprint.
Yeah.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.468
And that is where
the miracle comes in.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.303
Figuring out
whose print to use.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.640
Thank you, Aram.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.709
Here's hoping
for a miracle.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.396
Raymond!

41:21.046 --> 41:25.083
Thank you for coming.
We have much to discuss.

41:25.216 --> 41:27.886
I am told Rakitin
is in play.

41:28.019 --> 41:31.289
My safe deposit box
was compromised.

41:31.422 --> 41:33.892
The flash drive
I entrusted you with?

41:34.025 --> 41:35.661
I'm still looking for it.

41:35.794 --> 41:39.931
No doubt we have
Elizabeth Keen to thank
for it going missing.

41:40.065 --> 41:42.934
My position in regard to her
has not changed.

41:43.068 --> 41:46.137
I understand.
She is untouchable.

41:46.271 --> 41:48.439
But you must understand,

41:48.574 --> 41:50.942
Harold Cooper is <i>not.</i>

42:01.052 --> 42:03.521
Will miracles never cease?

42:03.655 --> 42:07.292
If he gains access
to the Rakitin files,

42:07.425 --> 42:09.628
you'll have to
eliminate him.

42:12.297 --> 42:14.332
I understand.
