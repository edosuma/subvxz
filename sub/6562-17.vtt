00:09.333 --> 00:12.933
[pop music]

00:14.333 --> 00:17.700
- WELL, THIS SHOULD
BE INTERESTING.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.267
- ALL OVER THE WORLD THIS MONTH

00:19.267 --> 00:22.267
TEENS ARE PARTICIPATING
IN A RIGHT OF PASSAGE.

00:22.267 --> 00:25.000
AND THAT PASSAGE
IS SIMPLY KNOWN AS

00:25.000 --> 00:26.667
PROM.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.900
- THE DANCE OF ALL DANCES,

00:29.900 --> 00:32.533
WHERE BOYS AND GIRLS COME
TOGETHER IN RENTED CLOTHING

00:32.533 --> 00:35.367
AND DRESSES THEIR PARENTS ARE
TERRIFIED TO LET THEM WEAR.

00:35.367 --> 00:36.800
- MR. ROCQUE,

00:36.800 --> 00:38.767
WE'VE GIVEN YOU OVER A YEAR

00:44.433 --> 00:49.267
OF DANCING, SMOOCHING,

00:49.267 --> 00:51.567
AND PRIME RIB.

00:51.567 --> 00:54.100
- THE ONE NIGHT WHERE
A SIMPLE BOY FROM MINNESOTA

00:54.100 --> 00:55.267
CAN BECOME A KING.

00:55.267 --> 00:57.500
NOW WE BEG OF YOU,
GUSTAVO ROCQUE,

00:57.500 --> 01:00.867
WILL YOU GIVE US
THE GIFT OF PROM?

01:00.867 --> 01:02.533
- GOOD SPEECH.

01:02.533 --> 01:03.967
- YES.
- YES!

01:03.967 --> 01:05.433
- AW, I REMEMBER MY PROM,

01:05.433 --> 01:06.667
AND THE BOYS DESERVE ONE TOO.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.733
AND OH, LOOK, A LETTER OPENER.

01:09.733 --> 01:11.733
- PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,

01:11.733 --> 01:13.067
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!

01:13.067 --> 01:14.200
- FINE, I'LL PAY FOR YOUR PROM.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.267
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH *

01:15.267 --> 01:17.667
- WAIT, WHY "UH-OH"?
- HE SAID YES.

01:17.667 --> 01:18.700
- IT'S THE BOOM BOX.

01:18.700 --> 01:19.967
- PLAYING BIG TIME RUSH.
- SHUT IT OFF.

01:19.967 --> 01:21.633
- I CAN'T TURN IT OFF.

01:21.633 --> 01:23.467
- JUST PRESS THE BUTTON
ON THE LEFT.

01:23.467 --> 01:24.467
- SHUT IT OFF!

01:24.467 --> 01:25.700
- IT WON'T TURN OFF!

01:25.700 --> 01:27.500
- * MAKE IT COUNT,
PLAY IT STRAIGHT *

01:27.500 --> 01:29.333
* DON'T LOOK BACK,
DON'T HESITATE *

01:29.333 --> 01:33.467
- * WHEN YOU GO BIG TIME *

01:33.467 --> 01:35.333
- * WHAT YOU WANT,
WHAT YOU FEEL *

01:35.333 --> 01:37.300
* NEVER QUIT
AND MAKE IT REAL *

01:37.300 --> 01:40.400
- * WHEN YOU ROLL BIG TIME *

01:40.400 --> 01:41.500
- * OH-OH, OH-OH *

01:41.500 --> 01:43.300
- * HEY, HEY *

01:43.300 --> 01:45.433
- * LISTEN TO YOUR HEART NOW *

01:45.433 --> 01:47.167
- * HEY, HEY *

01:47.167 --> 01:49.333
- * DON'T YOU FEEL THE RUSH *

01:49.333 --> 01:51.067
- * UH-OH, UH-OH *

01:51.067 --> 01:52.333
* UH-OH, UH-OH *

01:52.333 --> 01:53.333
- * OH *

01:53.333 --> 01:54.733
- * GO AND SHAKE IT UP *

01:54.733 --> 01:57.300
* WHATCHA GOTTA LOSE *

01:57.300 --> 01:58.633
* GO AND MAKE YOUR LUCK *

01:58.633 --> 02:01.267
* WITH THE LIFE YOU CHOOSE *

02:01.267 --> 02:04.900

LAY IT ON THE LINE *

02:04.900 --> 02:10.167
* IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU GOT
SO YOU GOT TO LIVE IT BIG TIME *

02:15.067 --> 02:16.400
all: WELL?

02:16.400 --> 02:18.200
all: HE SAID YES!

02:18.200 --> 02:20.267
[screaming]

02:20.267 --> 02:22.100
- WE NEED DRESSES!

02:22.100 --> 02:25.067
[screaming]

02:26.500 --> 02:28.800
- IS PROM SUPPOSED TO HURT?

02:28.800 --> 02:32.267
- SO SHOULD I GO RENT A TUX OR--

02:32.267 --> 02:34.333
- WELL, IF THAT'S YOUR WAY
OF ASKING ME TO THE PROM,

02:34.333 --> 02:35.267
THEN LET'S GO.

02:42.233 --> 02:43.600
- PFFT.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.167
OKAY, I'M FINE, OKAY?

02:45.167 --> 02:46.633
WE'RE NOT GOING OUT.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.800
AND SHE GO
WITH WHOEVER SHE WANTS.

02:48.800 --> 02:49.800
- DON'T WORRY.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.633
WHEN I'M PROM KING

02:52.633 --> 02:54.233
THERE WILL BE PLENTY
OF ROOM FOR YOU

02:54.233 --> 02:56.067
AND YOU OTHER NON-KINGS
IN MY COURT.

02:56.067 --> 02:57.967
- YOU BOUGHT A CROWN?

02:57.967 --> 03:00.300
- YEAH, PROM CROWNS TEND
TO BE MADE OF CARDBOARD.

03:00.300 --> 03:03.533
I WANTED SOMETHING
MORE AUTHENTIC.

03:03.533 --> 03:06.100
- YOU REALIZE,
YOUR HIGHNESS,

03:06.100 --> 03:07.600
THAT THE LONGEST DATING COUPLE

03:07.600 --> 03:09.500
IS USUALLY VOTED
PROM KING AND QUEEN.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.867
AND THAT'S ME AND JO.

03:11.867 --> 03:13.533
- I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU.

03:13.533 --> 03:15.167
- UNLESS OF COURSE,

03:15.167 --> 03:16.800
THE SENTIMENTAL VOTE
RULES THE NIGHT,

03:16.800 --> 03:19.500
WHICH GOES TO THE MOST LIKED
PERSON AT THE PROM.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.700
AND THAT WOULD BE CAMILLE...

03:20.700 --> 03:23.067
AND HER DATE.

03:23.067 --> 03:25.133
- OR THE HOTTEST COUPLE VOTE,

03:25.133 --> 03:26.700
WHICH WOULD GO TO ME
WHEN I PICK MY QUEEN.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.500
MM-HMM.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.500
YOU MIGHT WANT TO BOW NOW.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.767
- I MIGHT WANT TO HIT YOU NOW.

03:31.767 --> 03:32.967
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

03:32.967 --> 03:35.067
LET'S NOT FORGET
ABOUT THE UNDERDOG VOTE,

03:35.067 --> 03:37.767
GIVEN TO THE MOST UNEXPECTED
COUPLE AT THE PROM,

03:37.767 --> 03:41.200
WHICH WILL BE ME AND JENNIFER.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.200
- WHICH ONE?

03:42.200 --> 03:43.200
- DON'T KNOW YET.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.533
BUT THAT IS WHY I HIRED

03:44.533 --> 03:46.067
MY JENNIFER CONSULTANT.

03:47.933 --> 03:50.933
- OKAY, LET'S GET YOU A DATE
TO THE PROM.

03:50.933 --> 03:54.333
TAKE OFF THE HELMET.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.067
- STILL WAITING FOR THAT BOW.

03:58.067 --> 03:59.567
- YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

04:07.233 --> 04:10.267
[knocking at door]

04:10.267 --> 04:12.500
[sweet guitar playing]

04:12.500 --> 04:13.667
- IMPRESSIVE.

04:13.667 --> 04:17.633
- JO TAYLOR, HALF OF THE LONGEST
DATING COUPLE

04:17.633 --> 04:19.067
AT THE PALMWOODS,

04:19.067 --> 04:22.333
WILL YOU BE MY DATE
TO THE PROM?

04:22.333 --> 04:26.200
* *

04:26.200 --> 04:27.267
- NO.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.500
- WHAT?

04:28.500 --> 04:29.967
IT'S THE PROM.

04:29.967 --> 04:31.700
AND WE NEED TO TEACH JAMES
A ROYAL LESSON.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.533
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU DOING
ON FRIDAY?

04:33.533 --> 04:36.200
- NOTHING, BECAUSE OF WHAT
HAPPENED ON MONDAY.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.833
REMEMBER?

04:37.833 --> 04:41.300
REMEMBER, MY CURFEW
IS 10:00 P.M. ON WEEKNIGHTS.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.300
- RELAX.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.500
WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.233
IT'S ONLY MIDNIGHT.

04:46.233 --> 04:47.600
GO!

04:47.600 --> 04:49.767
GO, GO, GO!

04:49.767 --> 04:52.167
WELL, IT WAS
A SUPER STARRY NIGHT,

04:52.167 --> 04:53.400
AND WE JUST--

04:53.400 --> 04:55.667
MR. TAYLOR, SIR,

04:55.667 --> 04:57.067
SO NICE TO--

04:57.067 --> 04:58.400
- AH, THE CURFEW BREAKER.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.600
JO IS GROUNDED FOR THE WEEK

05:00.600 --> 05:03.133
AND ONLY ALLOWED OUT
OF THE APARTMENT FOR WORK.

05:03.133 --> 05:04.967
- YES, SIR.

05:04.967 --> 05:06.700
BUT THIS WEEKEND IS THE PROM,

05:06.700 --> 05:08.167
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF WE COULD--

05:08.167 --> 05:11.300
[door slams]

05:11.300 --> 05:13.267
[pensive guitar playing]

05:13.267 --> 05:14.833
NOT HELPING.

05:14.833 --> 05:16.767
[sighs]

05:19.233 --> 05:21.233
- OKAY, FIRST WE HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT

05:21.233 --> 05:23.733
WHICH JENNIFER WOULD ACTUALLY
GO TO THE PROM WITH YOU,

05:23.733 --> 05:26.233
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHICH ONE HAS A SOUL.

05:26.233 --> 05:27.667
- HOW DO WE DO THAT?

05:27.667 --> 05:29.533
- THE DEAD BIRD TEST.

05:29.533 --> 05:33.667
WE THROW THIS FAKE DEAD BIRD
INTO THE PATH OF THE JENNIFERS.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.767
AND WHICHEVER ONE HAS A SOUL
WILL REACT WITH SYMPATHY.

05:40.267 --> 05:42.467
- EW!

05:42.467 --> 05:44.367
- GROSS!

05:44.367 --> 05:46.333
- OH, HOW SAD.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.400
- THAT'S YOUR GIRL.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.400
- OKAY, WISH ME LUCK.
- WAIT.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.833
IF SHE'S WITH
THE OTHER JENNIFERS,

05:50.833 --> 05:51.833
SHE'LL SHOOT YOU DOWN.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.667
WE HAVE TO SEPARATE THEM.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.433
- SEPARATE THE JENNIFERS?

05:55.433 --> 05:57.267
THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.

05:57.267 --> 05:58.300
- UNTIL TODAY.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.467
- OUT OF MY WAY!

06:00.467 --> 06:03.567
LIVE!

06:03.567 --> 06:04.567
DON'T YOU QUIT ON ME!

06:04.567 --> 06:07.567
COME ON, FIGHT!

06:07.567 --> 06:11.067
- AH, AN OUTFIT FIT FOR A KING.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.900
- YOU DO KNOW YOU CAN'T TAKE
YOURSELF TO THE PROM, RIGHT?

06:16.900 --> 06:20.367
- OH, YOU DON'T THINK
I'LL BE KING?

06:20.367 --> 06:22.167
- NO, YOU'RE GONNA BE KING.

06:22.167 --> 06:23.533
AND I'M GONNA MAKE SURE OF IT.

06:23.533 --> 06:25.233
- PROCEED.

06:25.233 --> 06:27.967
- OKAY, I CAN'T HAVE CAMILLE
AND STEVE WIN KING AND QUEEN.

06:27.967 --> 06:30.467
IT'S LIKE BEING ENGAGED
TO BE ENGAGED.

06:30.467 --> 06:32.967
AND SHE'S A LOCK
FOR THE SENTIMENTAL VOTE.

06:32.967 --> 06:35.167
- SO YOU LIKE CAMILLE AGAIN?

06:35.167 --> 06:36.200
- NOT SURE.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.533
BUT I AM SURE IF I DO,

06:37.533 --> 06:38.967
IT'S GONNA BE IMPOSSIBLE
TO DATE HER

06:38.967 --> 06:40.833
IF SHE'S SOMEBODY'S QUEEN.

06:40.833 --> 06:42.300
NOW WE ARE GONNA NEED
TO FIND YOU

06:42.300 --> 06:44.600
THE HOTTEST DATE IN THE WORLD
IF YOU WANT TO WIN THIS CROWN.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.500
I'M THINKING SIENNA IN 4K
OR NEW GIRL IN 2R.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.800
- YOU THINK LIKE A PEASANT,
MY FRIEND.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.833
YOU NEED TO THINK LIKE A KING.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.067
- AUBREY STEWART

06:59.067 --> 07:02.433
FROM THE VAMPIRE STORIES
CHRONICLE SAGA TRILOGY.

07:02.433 --> 07:03.567
IMPOSSIBLE.

07:03.567 --> 07:07.100
- NOT WHEN YOU HAVE
HER HOME ADDRESS.

07:07.100 --> 07:08.400
- YOU HAVE HER HOME ADDRESS?

07:08.400 --> 07:11.233
- NO, WE NEED TO GET
HER HOME ADDRESS.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.600
- MAY I PRESENT THE FINEST
PROM PROFESSIONALS

07:16.600 --> 07:18.833
THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN L.A.

07:18.833 --> 07:21.067
IN SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

07:21.067 --> 07:23.767
- HMM, MM-HMM.

07:23.767 --> 07:26.300
HMM.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.133
YOU'RE FIRED.
YOU'RE FIRED.

07:28.133 --> 07:30.100
GET OUT!

07:31.900 --> 07:33.900
I LOVE FIRING PEOPLE.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.067
- HA HA!

07:35.067 --> 07:36.333
WHAT WAS THAT?

07:36.333 --> 07:38.533
- WE BEGIN WORKING
ON A NEW ALBUM NEXT WEEK,

07:38.533 --> 07:41.600
AND THE DOGS
HAVE MADE ME WIMPY,

07:41.600 --> 07:43.267
LIKE AGREEING TO THIS PROM.

07:43.267 --> 07:46.900
AND I NEED TO GET MY EDGE BACK.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.867
IN FACT,
YOU'RE FIRED!

07:49.867 --> 07:50.867
- GREAT!

07:50.867 --> 07:52.867
THEN YOU CAN COOK FOR
AND DJ

07:52.867 --> 07:54.167
AND PHOTOGRAPH 100 TEENS,

07:54.167 --> 07:55.933
'CAUSE YOU JUST FIRED
THE LAST PEOPLE

07:55.933 --> 07:57.233
AVAILABLE TO WORK FRIDAY,

07:57.233 --> 07:59.800
'CAUSE ALL OVER L.A.,
IT'S PROM SEASON.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.067
- SORRY!
YOU'RE NOT FIRED.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.067
- I KNOW.

08:05.067 --> 08:08.233
- NOW, HOW DO YOU MAKE A PROM?

08:09.900 --> 08:11.067
- COME ON!

08:11.067 --> 08:12.933
I'VE SAID "PLEASE"
LIKE 30 TIMES.

08:12.933 --> 08:15.600
- I CAN'T GO, BECAUSE I CAN'T
LEAVE THE APARTMENT.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.667
I'M NOT EVEN SURE THIS IS LEGAL.

08:17.667 --> 08:19.167
- LIFE IS SHORT.

08:19.167 --> 08:21.867
AND YOU ONLY GET ONE
OR TWO PROMS YOUR WHOLE LIFE,

08:21.867 --> 08:25.067
THREE IF YOU'RE A REALLY
GOOD-LOOKING SOPHOMORE.

08:25.067 --> 08:26.900
- YOU KNOW MY DAD
WAS A MARINE, RIGHT?

08:26.900 --> 08:29.067
- AND YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN
DATING THE LONGEST,

08:29.067 --> 08:32.533
WHICH MEANS WE'RE PRACTICALLY
A LOCK FOR KING AND QUEEN.

08:32.533 --> 08:33.700
all: HE'S RIGHT, JO!

08:35.933 --> 08:37.567
- WHAT IF WE GET CAUGHT?

08:37.567 --> 08:39.300
- THEN I'LL GET A MADDER DAD,

08:39.300 --> 08:40.867
AND YOU'LL GET
A LONGER GROUNDING,

08:40.867 --> 08:42.067
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH IT,

08:42.067 --> 08:43.633
BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE DANCED
ALL NIGHT,

08:43.633 --> 08:45.933
AND I COULD STICK IT TO JAY.

08:45.933 --> 08:47.467
B-B-B-BUT MOSTLY
DANCE ALL NIGHT.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.767
- WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

08:53.767 --> 08:55.167
- JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

08:56.267 --> 08:57.633
BUDDHA JOE!

08:57.633 --> 08:59.767
WILL YOU HELP ME SNEAK JO OFF
THE SECOND STORY BALCONY

08:59.767 --> 09:00.900
SO WE CAN GO
TO THE PROM TOGETHER?

09:00.900 --> 09:02.067
- YEAH, SURE.

09:02.067 --> 09:04.967
AS SOON AS I HELP CARLOS
SEPARATE THE JENNIFERS.

09:07.133 --> 09:08.933
OH, SORRY.
I GOT TO CLEAN HERE.

09:08.933 --> 09:10.233
- I HAVE TO GET TO THE ELEVATOR.

09:10.233 --> 09:12.467
- OH, GOT TO CLEAN THERE.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.767
- SORRY, ONLY ROOM FOR ONE.

09:17.767 --> 09:20.100
- WHAT?

09:25.200 --> 09:26.200
