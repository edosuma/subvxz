-That's your dog, the Moose?
-Mm-hmm.

01:11.654 --> 01:15.033
-How long's the car
been on the lot?
-No more than a couple of days.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.869
I was gonna take it in today.
I take 'em in every Tuesday

around here since the time
you opened the trunk?

Yes, I did. The Moose
got his paws...

that I think is involved.

-What happened, Mr. Keho?
-4:00 this morning,

01:33.134 --> 01:35.637
the Moose is in a brawl,
and I figure,

01:35.637 --> 01:38.098
uh, he's kicking
another dog's ass.

You know, yelling for me.

So I run out, and I see him
lying on the ground,

01:43.269 --> 01:46.272

is peeling off the lot,

01:46.272 --> 01:49.442
his tires spitting mud
all over him.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.070
The person in that
car that peeled off...

01:52.070 --> 01:55.240
could have definitely put
the body in this car's trunk.

was agitating over.

must've kicked him.

The vet says he has
definite sore ribs.

at the driver?
-No. It was pretty dark.

The Moose got a better look.

Well, since the Moose
took a beating, we'll hold off

on the street.

13:27.389 --> 13:31.519
Lost my job recently,
and I got evicted.

13:31.519 --> 13:34.980
-It's rough.
-You ever been
to the Starlight Lounge?

13:34.980 --> 13:37.399
-I don't believe so.
-So, if we show this picture...

13:37.399 --> 13:39.985
around that bar,
nobody's gonna know you?

13:39.985 --> 13:42.404
-Uh, I've never been there.
-You a pervert, Jeremy?

13:42.404 --> 13:46.408
-Get outta here.
-Says you took a collar here
for dicky waving.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.786
I got drunk
and pissed in a park.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.914
Look, I don't know
about this girl.
I found this card.

13:51.914 --> 13:55.167
-Do you want me
to tell you how?
-Absolutely.

13:55.167 --> 14:00.297
Well, I, uh--I sleep
in this window ledge
in this building on 9th.

14:00.297 --> 14:03.759
And, uh, early this morning,
this guy come out of
the building across the street,

14:03.759 --> 14:07.346
and he's holding
a brown paper bag
and this green flannel.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.724
He's acting like a freak.
You know, looking around
to see is he being watched.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.852
So, he goes down the street
to this trash can,

14:12.852 --> 14:17.648
dumps the bag and a shirt
and goes back to his building,
still lookin' around.

14:17.648 --> 14:21.694
So, I, uh--
I checked the trash can...

14:21.694 --> 14:24.321
and found a wallet
inside the brown bag,

14:24.321 --> 14:27.449
and I--I took the card.

14:27.449 --> 14:30.035
Look, I know I shouldn't
have used it, but--

14:30.035 --> 14:34.456
Look, I'm in this cycle right
now smokin' and gettin' clean,

14:34.456 --> 14:38.460
and then workin'
and gettin' fired
and gettin' evicted.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.046
Man, I just needed
some bread.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.090
You remember what
this guy looked like,
the one who dumped the bag?

14:43.090 --> 14:46.886
-Sure. Yeah.
-You're gonna point out his
building and identify him.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.096
And then maybe we can arrange
something about this other--

14:49.096 --> 14:51.515
-If you're not lying.
-I wouldn't.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.893
Oh, yeah, show us that sign.
Now we're reassured.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.895
-Come on.
-We're going now?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.272
Yep.
Here we go, Jeremy.

15:03.903 --> 15:04.987
Simone.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.699
-Two minutes, huh?
-I like your optimism.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.702
All right, come on.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.495
-How's it going, Henry?
-How's it going?

15:13.495 --> 15:16.081
Paintin' this woman's place
could cost me my sanity.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.292
Two hundred for the job.
There's no renegotiating.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.502
Add a zero,
it still wouldn't be enough.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.504
This woman's like
a fanatic kibitzer.

15:22.504 --> 15:26.342
Plus, now you open a beachhead,
she's got a "to do" list
the length of my arm.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.552
Well, tell her you were
only hired for the paint job.

15:28.552 --> 15:31.931
Yeah, then I'll just run outside
and throw up into
a 50-mile-an-hour wind.

15:31.931 --> 15:36.143
-Look, Henry, I'm workin' here.
-She's got me fetching her mail,
bringing her tea.

15:36.143 --> 15:39.521
-It's as bad
as with my mother.
-Lay down the law to her.

15:39.521 --> 15:43.108
You gotta do that as landlord.
"These are the things
that Henry does,

15:43.108 --> 15:46.695
and these he's in no way
obliged to do."

15:47.446 --> 15:50.908
Make a list, Henry,
what you'll go for
and what you won't, okay?

15:50.908 --> 15:53.744
Well, then we need
to sit down with her,

15:53.744 --> 15:56.747
-and we need to settle it.
-I'll try to get over
there tonight.

15:56.747 --> 16:01.210
What happened to that phone
girl? Looks like someone
took a chisel to her face.

16:03.545 --> 16:05.965
Attempted rape.
The guy cut her.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.591
Don't be stupid walking out.

16:07.591 --> 16:11.595
Thanks for the yellow flag.
I'd intended to point and laugh.

Andy, you ready?

16:19.937 --> 16:22.356
Yeah. Come on.

a fish named after him.

16:24.775 --> 16:28.320

-Yeah, it's a monkfish.
Munk's my last name.

-Here you go.

with the details...

with Sig Johnson...

16:41.375 --> 16:43.377
over the air conditioner

16:43.377 --> 16:46.588

once it's left my control.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.427
Okay. Okay,
what we need to know now...

16:51.427 --> 16:54.221
is what happened
when you and Sig Johnson
last saw each other.

16:54.221 --> 16:58.642
Sig Johnson left the bar
following kickin' my ass,
unjustly.

16:58.642 --> 17:01.437
-What did you do after that?
-I dragged myself out of there.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.814
-To where?
-I saw a friend.

17:03.814 --> 17:07.609
You need
to get specific, Stympy,
so we can check your story.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.194
Why? You know,
I'm the one...

17:09.194 --> 17:11.989
should be putting the
complaint out on Sig instead
of it's the other way around.

17:11.989 --> 17:15.617
Sig Johnson's
not making no complaints,
'cause he's presently dead.

I didn't murder anybody.

He harasses this girl
at her place of work
for two weeks.

24:58.288 --> 25:01.291
This guy, Lentz, coincidentally
ends up with this girl's wallet,

25:01.291 --> 25:02.876
but the grand jury
still won't indict?

25:02.876 --> 25:06.922
It's all this evidentiary
nonsense about directly
connecting him to the crime.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.174
We got enough for
a warrant on his place?

25:09.174 --> 25:12.010
-I could dress it up enough
to get you a warrant.
-How come with you, Cohen,

25:12.010 --> 25:15.138
it comes out like the principal
doing us a favor?

25:15.138 --> 25:18.975
'Cause the school's
the Constitution, Sipowicz,
and you're the class dunce.

Hey, Greg,
a man downstairs says
he saw that neighbor woman,

25:33.114 --> 25:35.700
Mrs. Buono,
was nice to the D.O.A.'s wife.

25:35.700 --> 25:39.287
He says he saw Mrs. Buono
out on the stoop
at 4:00 this morning.

25:39.287 --> 25:41.289
We ought to ask her
about that.

25:41.289 --> 25:43.041
Yeah, well,
she's not inside. Uh--

25:43.041 --> 25:47.754
Note says,
"Frank, I'm with Hilda."
This is her apartment.

Your wife's fine.
She's downstairs.

We'd like to
ask you some questions
if you got a minute.

26:04.771 --> 26:07.357
Okay. I, uh--

26:07.357 --> 26:10.944
I'd like to get down
with my wife and Mrs. Johnson,
bein' her husband died.

26:10.944 --> 26:14.406
-Absolutely.
-What time did you leave
the building this morning?

26:14.406 --> 26:17.867
-Uh, 5:30.
-Did you see anything unusual?

26:17.867 --> 26:20.745
-No.
-Were you and your wife home
all night last night?

26:20.745 --> 26:24.249
-Either of you go out at all?
-We were home since 7:00.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.585
-And you were here
right through till the morning?
-Yeah.

26:28.545 --> 26:31.673
Is there any possibility
that your wife went out
early this morning...

26:31.673 --> 26:33.425
while you were still sleeping?

26:33.425 --> 26:36.428
-I sleep bad. I'd have heard.
-One of your neighbors said...

26:36.428 --> 26:40.223
he saw your wife outside
on the stoop at 4:00
when he went to work.

26:40.223 --> 26:42.434
-Who said that?
-He figured she'd been
out walking...

26:42.434 --> 26:45.228
since she was knocking
the mud off her shoes.

26:45.228 --> 26:48.690
-I-I don't know what to say
about this.
-Frank, would you mind coming...

26:48.690 --> 26:50.567
down to the station house
with us?

26:50.567 --> 26:55.238
-We can clear up
these discrepancies.
-I wanna talk to my wife.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.282
My partner'll ride with you
down to the station house.

26:57.282 --> 27:01.578
-I'll bring your wife
myself, okay?
-That sound like a plan?

27:01.578 --> 27:02.871
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Okay.

27:13.214 --> 27:16.259
He's mostly quiet.
Sometimes you get noises late.

27:16.259 --> 27:20.722

-Sex noises...
involved in sex.

You ever get a look
at any of the women
he brings over here?

27:22.724 --> 27:26.311
Never one.
But this unit's got
a backyard entrance.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.647
I guess that's where
he brings 'em in.

27:38.990 --> 27:43.244
Um, that's to the backyard.
We'll check it out.

27:43.244 --> 27:46.623
Could you just stand over here
to the side until we finish?

27:46.623 --> 27:49.250
Let's get Crime Scene in here,
have 'em process the bed.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.252
See what they
come up with.

27:51.252 --> 27:55.590
As neat as this guy is though,
I figure he'd wash the sheets...

Andy.

He is neat.
The titles are alphabetically.

Look here.
Here's his reading material.

Bobby, Andy, we came up with
some kind of black bag

Other side of the fence.
Looks like a body bag.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.426
D.O.A.'s a blonde? 'Cause
there's blonde hairs in the bag.

-Yeah, she's blonde.
-Why don't you get
Crime Scene in here?

-Mm-hmm.

The body bag...

29:10.707 --> 29:13.334
that they found
on the trash cans--
that was a casket cover.

29:13.334 --> 29:16.921
So we got the lab
working on some blonde hairs
that were caught in the zipper.

29:16.921 --> 29:17.964

a couple weeks for D.N.A.

the porno tapes?

Well, this guy Lentz,
he had some shrine
to his top three stars.

One of them--I guess
you could make the case--
resembles the D.O.A.

-Any chance it is the D.O.A.?
-It's like a resemblance.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.153
You'd never mistake
'em for each other.

Oh, God, forgive us.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.854

smashed in Sig Johnson's head.

My partner and I
got a big concern about
your wife being outside...

31:37.520 --> 31:40.315
in the middle of the
night, the area where this
typewriter was found.

31:40.315 --> 31:43.484
She's outside
without explanation,
4:00 a.m.,

31:43.484 --> 31:46.279
seen by a witness
cleaning mud from her shoes.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.865
What we're gonna pursue
is that mud...

31:48.865 --> 31:51.326
from the lot where your
neighbor's body was found.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.495
She didn't do anything,
so will you leave her alone?

31:54.495 --> 31:56.706
We can't do that
until we get an explanation.

31:56.706 --> 31:59.083
Frank, the reason we're looking
to you for help is, uh,

31:59.083 --> 32:01.502
how would your wife have
the strength to kill Sig?

32:01.502 --> 32:05.965
-You know, how he died.
-And yet, she was outside
and somehow involved.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.553
Promise me she won't go to jail
if I tell you what happened?

32:10.553 --> 32:13.056
Tell us the truth, and
we'll see what we can
do to help.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.936
She just moved the typewriter.
That's it.

32:17.936 --> 32:21.356
Your wife took the typewriter
from the lot around
4:00 this morning...

32:21.356 --> 32:22.899
and threw it
in the Dumpster?

32:22.899 --> 32:26.402
-That's her whole involvement.
-Frank, why'd she move
the typewriter?

32:31.616 --> 32:33.159
I'm who threw it.

32:34.535 --> 32:37.246
I killed Sig.
Oh, my God!

32:37.246 --> 32:39.540
(crying)

32:39.540 --> 32:42.543
-Why'd you do it, Frank?
-She types.

32:42.543 --> 32:46.381
She types to help expenses,
but only if it don't cut in,
you know?

32:46.381 --> 32:49.300
Briefs for a law firm.
But if it don't cut in.

32:50.176 --> 32:52.971
Come home last night,
9:30, no dinner.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.973
There's no dinner all week.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.809
Just tick-tick-tick
from her typing.

32:57.809 --> 33:02.939
Don't even know I come home.
I lost my temper.
I lost control.

33:02.939 --> 33:06.693
I wanted dinner.
And look up at least
when I come in.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.945
So you threw your wife's
typewriter out the window?

33:08.945 --> 33:11.948
We don't got a window.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.282
I--

33:15.243 --> 33:18.037
I went and threw it
off the roof.
(sobbing)

33:19.205 --> 33:23.543
The dark--
I never even knew I hit Sig.

33:23.543 --> 33:26.379
She didn't know he was hurt
until she snuck out
to bring it back in,

33:26.379 --> 33:29.632
hoping it wasn't busted too bad.

33:29.632 --> 33:32.218
She finally called
and told me this afternoon.

33:32.218 --> 33:35.972
She's been with Hilda all day.
Conscience tearing her up.

33:38.891 --> 33:42.395
I'm such an asshole.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.522
(sobbing)

33:54.407 --> 33:59.203
We're gonna tell you how
things are, Mel, then you'll
decide the future direction.

33:59.203 --> 34:03.416
-I didn't do anything.
-First, we put a moratorium
on the "I didn't do nothing,"

34:03.416 --> 34:07.211
'cause that pisses
my partner off,
and all of us know it's crap.

34:07.211 --> 34:10.256
That casket casing that you put
Antoinette's body in, Mel?

34:10.256 --> 34:13.593
Some of her hair got caught when
you zippered her up in that.

34:13.593 --> 34:15.887
-I don't know
what you're talking about.
-That's first cousin...

34:15.887 --> 34:18.890
to "I didn't do nothing,"
and it's gonna get you struck.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.893
-There was nothing incriminating
on my property.
-You wanna bet your life...

34:21.893 --> 34:26.022
that a jury's gonna care
if it was on your property
or in the alley just off of it?

34:26.022 --> 34:28.858
I never hurt anybody in my life.
I never even got
a speeding ticket.

34:28.858 --> 34:32.028
-Why am I gonna kill her?
-That's what we
were wondering, Mel.

34:32.028 --> 34:35.448
What hatched your sick self
from the eggshell?

34:35.448 --> 34:39.243
Till we went to your apartment
and saw all those ladies
you got living there.

34:39.243 --> 34:42.455
No, I don't have ladies
to my place.

34:42.455 --> 34:45.374
What about, uh,
Christy Darling?

34:45.374 --> 34:47.251
You don't whip your skippy
thinking about...

34:47.251 --> 34:50.046
what you'd do to her if
you saw her out on the street?

34:50.046 --> 34:54.092
What about Chantal Marmont?

34:54.092 --> 34:56.719
You saw Chantal, you'd follow
her to work, wouldn't you?

34:56.719 --> 35:00.515
-I don't know 'em.
-(paper bag rustling)

35:01.641 --> 35:05.311
Say you saw Candace Champagne
waiting tables at a bar, Mel.

35:05.311 --> 35:06.687
That would get a chubby going,
wouldn't it?

35:06.687 --> 35:11.275
-I don't know
any of these people.
-Candy Champagne, Mel.

35:11.275 --> 35:14.070
This is the porn actress
that's on half your closet wall.

35:14.070 --> 35:17.698
Looks like some stuff's
been washed off
her picture there, Mel.

35:17.698 --> 35:21.077
What type fluid
would that be?

35:21.077 --> 35:22.912
I don't know her,
and I'm a normal guy.

35:22.912 --> 35:26.290
That room with the shrine
to the porn queens,
that looked real normal.

35:26.290 --> 35:29.460
-There's nothing wrong
with pornography.
-They made a movie about that.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.504
Right? Larry Flynt?
He's a big hero.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.965
-I happen to be normal,
all right?
-Mm-hmm.

35:33.965 --> 35:38.386
-A normal guy
with a midget pecker.
-You want to compare?

35:38.386 --> 35:41.139
Yeah, sure, Mel.
Let's whip 'em out here.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.142
We'll all be normal together.
This guy's half a fag.

35:44.142 --> 35:48.312
Whoa, whoa, Andy.
You're a normal guy that
doesn't deal easily with women.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.314
-Is that more fair?
-I satisfy myself.

35:50.314 --> 35:55.528
Mel satisfying himself.
That's what got washed off
all these pictures.

35:55.528 --> 35:59.740
-You get scared around women?
-I just don't--I just
don't have a smooth line.

35:59.740 --> 36:02.702
SIMONE: And that's
frustrating, right? Words
don't come when you want 'em.

36:02.702 --> 36:06.330
I just can't, um, you know,
say what I'm feeling.

36:06.330 --> 36:09.750
Mel's a totally normal man-mute
before human women.

36:09.750 --> 36:13.754
No, he hides at home, and he
flogs his dummy to pictures
he don't have to talk to.

36:13.754 --> 36:16.591
I try to make myself understood.
I am a normal person!

36:16.591 --> 36:20.595
So, Mel, this girl
reminded you of Candy? The one
you talked to in the bar?

36:20.595 --> 36:23.598
Half-blind geek. He probably
thought it was the same broad.

36:23.598 --> 36:26.184
-I try to make
myself understood.
-How'd you do that, Mel, huh?

36:26.184 --> 36:29.187
You jump on the table,
pull out your johnson
and make monkey sounds?

36:29.187 --> 36:33.357
-Andy.
-I talk to her
one person to another.

36:33.357 --> 36:37.778
And when she told you to get
lost, you burned her with wax
and you strangled her.

36:37.778 --> 36:41.157
-Yeah? I wouldn't know
anything about that.
-Whoa, whoa. One second, Mel.

36:41.157 --> 36:44.577
Don't start with, "I don't know
anything about that," 'cause
then you're gonna lose me.

36:44.577 --> 36:48.372
Okay, I tried to talk to her
repeatedly and politely.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.999
Don't you understand, Bobby?

36:49.999 --> 36:53.586
-Mel was just trying
to make friends.
-I am a normal person!

36:53.586 --> 36:57.965
And I told her that she
resembled a friend of mine, and
I tried to talk to her normally.

36:57.965 --> 37:00.426
And she told you
you're a half-blind geek,

37:00.426 --> 37:03.930
and she don't care who
she looked like, and why
didn't you leave her alone.

37:03.930 --> 37:08.601
Then I tried to talk to her
politely in the street,
and she maced me!

37:08.601 --> 37:12.188
-And she screamed at me!
-Provoking him in that fashion?

37:12.188 --> 37:16.817
Screaming and trying
to protect herself,
yet people can't fathom...

37:16.817 --> 37:21.030
why a weak-eyed,
tiny-dicked pervert like Mel
would go committing a murder.

37:21.030 --> 37:24.033
Okay! All right!
I wanna say this
the way that I wanna say it...

37:24.033 --> 37:25.618
and not the way
that he makes it sound!

37:25.618 --> 37:28.955
It's your statement, Mel.
Your statement.

37:28.955 --> 37:31.207
Okay, I'm gonna say this
the way that I want to!

37:31.207 --> 37:35.044
All right. Put the facts
right down here in the context
that you want 'em seen.

37:35.044 --> 37:38.256
That's another great right
we got here.
Yeah, go ahead.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.675
Let him put it
however he wants it.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.511
This country--
I don't know what the hell
is happening to it.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.138
(door slams)

38:00.653 --> 38:03.447
-So how'd it go today, Gina?
-Good, Lieutenant.

38:03.447 --> 38:08.411
-I feel really lucky
working here.
-Yeah? Good night.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.579
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Yeah.

38:15.251 --> 38:18.879
-Hey, all done?
-Hey, James.

38:18.879 --> 38:21.924
What's the matter?

38:21.924 --> 38:25.678
I guess I'm relieved
that the first shift is over,
and everyone's being so nice.

38:25.678 --> 38:30.516
Yeah. I got specific plans
carrying through with that
this evening.

38:30.516 --> 38:35.604
-I'll meet you outside?
-Yeah. Give me a hundred-step
head start, all right?

38:42.486 --> 38:45.281
-(knocking)
-Yeah?

38:45.281 --> 38:47.283
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:47.283 --> 38:50.494
I'll, um--I'll make us
spaghetti and meatballs.

38:50.494 --> 38:52.288
I don't know how long this
building thing is gonna take.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.707
-I got Henry, this old lady.
-I'll make the meatballs,

38:54.707 --> 38:57.752
and I'll put the water
on low for the pasta.

39:02.965 --> 39:04.967
Counselor go okay?

39:04.967 --> 39:09.347
Yeah, it did.
Dougie's really trying hard.

39:09.347 --> 39:13.059
-Boss pissed off I took
the lost time?
-No, not at all.

39:13.976 --> 39:18.314
-Your mom show up?
-Oh, she still has a cold.

39:18.314 --> 39:21.567
I think that could last
a few years.

39:25.946 --> 39:29.909
-I'm-I'm so nervous talking
about it with you, Bobby.
-It's okay.

39:29.909 --> 39:33.329
I'm not pretending my dad
didn't do what he did,
or the family problems.

39:33.329 --> 39:36.749
I just don't want it to be
all we talk about.

39:36.749 --> 39:41.003
You really run your mouth.
I think you talked about it,
like, a total of five minutes.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.423
If you had to guess about
the building, what do you think,
a couple hours?

39:44.423 --> 39:48.469
If it's more than
a couple hours, I want you
over there with a gun.

39:48.469 --> 39:51.055
I've never been so involved
with my cooking.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.891
This--
(sighs)

39:53.891 --> 39:58.020
This broadening out the base
of our relationship is rough.

39:58.020 --> 40:00.773
Although the counselor says
I've also got...

40:00.773 --> 40:04.985
these regressed infantile needs
for immediate gratification,

40:04.985 --> 40:09.156
and I shouldn't feel bad
about my impulses to intimacy.

40:10.366 --> 40:14.703
So it might be good for me
to bang you in
the shower right now.

40:18.666 --> 40:21.001
Why don't we try
to stay employed?

40:21.001 --> 40:25.256
And, uh, let me see to
this building thing.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.758
That's one way to stay dry.

40:30.052 --> 40:32.513
-I'll see you in a while.
-Mm-hmm.

40:52.616 --> 40:55.411
Don't let her get you defensive
or take the upper hand.

40:55.411 --> 40:58.831
-All right.
-And don't be mislead
by her size.

40:58.831 --> 41:01.625
Henry, I've dealt
with her before,
all right?

41:01.625 --> 41:03.627
-(buzzing)
-WOMAN:
Who is it?

41:03.627 --> 41:05.713
It's Bobby Simone.

41:09.091 --> 41:11.510
-Evening, Mrs. Murphy.
-What?

41:11.510 --> 41:14.096
Remember, we said we were gonna
come over and talk to you?

41:14.096 --> 41:16.807
-And I'd like to
know about what.
-Can we come in?

41:18.476 --> 41:21.312
-Concerning what subject?
-See this, Simone?

41:21.312 --> 41:23.272
This is her hand.
This is yours.

41:23.272 --> 41:26.066
Painting is, uh,
coming along pretty good here.

41:26.066 --> 41:29.737
-Henry's doing a good job.
-What walls
are you looking at?

41:29.737 --> 41:32.281
-Chronic and typical,
that type of comment.
-What was that?

41:32.281 --> 41:35.367
Nothing, Edie. Saying what
a pleasure you are to work for.

41:35.367 --> 41:37.661
You can see the end
of every brushstroke.

41:37.661 --> 41:42.041
The surface of these walls look
like a World War I battlefield.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.667
I never said
I was Michelangelo.

41:43.667 --> 41:46.670
-What did he say?
-Henry was saying he's doing
the best that he can.

41:46.670 --> 41:49.924
And I would say to my students,
"A poor thing it is."

41:49.924 --> 41:53.135
-This woman needs a beating.
-Now, you and I
had an agreement.

41:53.135 --> 41:56.347
I would withdraw my grievance
with the rent control board,

41:56.347 --> 41:58.724
only on the condition that
this place would be painted.

41:58.724 --> 42:00.935
-He's painting, Mrs. Murphy.
-(laughs)

42:00.935 --> 42:04.480
-He's wasting paint.
-Bring her tea, bring her mail.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.482
I'm like Custer
at Little Bighorn!

42:06.482 --> 42:09.902
Breaks open my mailbox
rather than climb the flight
for my key.

42:09.902 --> 42:12.112
-Someone else did that, Edith.
-Malarkey!

42:12.112 --> 42:14.490
What was I after,
coupons from Payless?

42:14.490 --> 42:17.826
I got your note about
the mailbox, and I'm definitely
gonna get to that.

42:17.826 --> 42:20.913
Meanwhile, I was the one
that asked Henry
to look out for the postman.

42:20.913 --> 42:23.499
Bring the mail up to you
so it wouldn't just
sit there in an open box.

42:23.499 --> 42:28.337
Look at those brushstrokes.
They look like tire tracks.

42:30.548 --> 42:34.969
All right. Uh, you know what?
I work a late tour on Thursday.

42:34.969 --> 42:37.304
I'll come around
Thursday morning.
I'll finish the job myself.

42:37.304 --> 42:41.475
(laughs)
Oh, I hope it wasn't you
who did the hallways.

42:41.475 --> 42:43.894
-No, ma'am.
-I painted these hallways,

42:43.894 --> 42:46.146
Edith, when this was
my mother's building.

42:46.146 --> 42:49.650
They're a decent job.
So is this here. And you're
an ungrateful biddy!

42:49.650 --> 42:52.528
-Henry--
-You're a layabout.

42:52.528 --> 42:55.155
-Come on now, Mrs. Murphy.
-Not up to his potential.

42:55.155 --> 42:59.159
-Correct himself now
or be ready for ruin.
-When you taught, Edith,

42:59.159 --> 43:01.954
students vote you Most Likely
to Come Back in Our Nightmares?

43:01.954 --> 43:03.038
Hey!

43:03.539 --> 43:07.543
If you've come here
to say he's quit,
say so and go.

43:07.543 --> 43:13.382
-I don't need a long preamble.
-Henry is not looking to quit,
Mrs. Murphy.

43:13.382 --> 43:17.011
He wants an understanding
what his responsibilities are.

43:17.011 --> 43:21.432
-Aim for competence!
-This is hopeless.

43:21.432 --> 43:25.227
Does he want appreciations
for his work and his company?

43:25.227 --> 43:28.188
I don't announce that
at the tolling of each hour.

43:28.188 --> 43:31.650
He will have to look
elsewhere for that.

43:32.776 --> 43:34.987
But you do appreciate...

43:34.987 --> 43:38.574
what Henry's doing for you,
don't you, Mrs. Murphy?

43:38.574 --> 43:43.454
He will have to look
elsewhere for that--
saying it every hour.

43:43.454 --> 43:47.583
I'm not looking for a Cessna
spelling "thank you"
in the sky, Edith.

43:47.583 --> 43:51.587
-Just try not to break my balls.
-There's no gutter here.

43:51.587 --> 43:55.257
Won't be tolerated
in these rooms--bringing in
the language of the street.

43:55.257 --> 43:58.636
-Now I'll have to clean
the erasers.
-But you are willing...

43:58.636 --> 44:02.097
to have Henry
finish this job, right,
because I'm paying him to do it?

44:02.097 --> 44:04.683
Well, yes!

44:04.683 --> 44:07.186
(scoffs, clicks tongue)

44:12.608 --> 44:15.027
I'm saying once,

44:15.027 --> 44:20.658
I'm grateful both
the labor and the company.

44:26.622 --> 44:28.832
-What did she say?
-What?

44:28.832 --> 44:33.629
N-Nothing, Edith.
I'll be happy
to finish the job.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.673
-All right, then.
-Good,

44:35.673 --> 44:38.092
'cause I swore that
I was painting on Thursday.

44:38.092 --> 44:42.096
Well, my arthritis
isn't too bad.

44:42.096 --> 44:44.682
Would you like to stay
for a pot of tea?

44:45.224 --> 44:48.143
-Sure. That'd be nice.
-Good. Sit.

44:55.651 --> 44:58.237
Her tea stinks.

45:14.294 --> 45:17.339
♪♪
