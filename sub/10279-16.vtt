E. R.

00:04.059 --> 00:05.268
Previously on E. R.

00:05.369 --> 00:07.000
Well, yeah, I had a life before John Carter.

00:07.101 --> 00:10.727
If you want someone with no history,
you're gonna have to find yourself a virgin.

00:10.728 --> 00:14.206
No. I'll settle for someone
who isn't hung up on somebody else.

00:14.541 --> 00:15.853
I'm not going home.

00:15.954 --> 00:19.395
I am taking you home right now or I'm
ratting you out to Weaver. What'll it be?

00:20.713 --> 00:23.527
- Are you moving?
- Yeah. The freak who hit me moved back in.

00:23.662 --> 00:26.040
You need a place to stay, let me help.

E. R. 8x16 "SECRETS AND LIES"

00:35.251 --> 00:38.205
Sorry. Did I wake you?

00:40.547 --> 00:42.206
No.

00:42.382 --> 00:44.291
Did you sleep well?

00:46.426 --> 00:49.427
- Yes. It was great.
- You should have let me take the couch.

00:49.512 --> 00:52.880
- It's not very comfortable.
- No, it was. It was. It was fine, really.

00:53.057 --> 00:54.930
Were you cold?

00:55.767 --> 00:58.257
I should have turned up the heat.

01:01.021 --> 01:02.978
I'm starting some coffee.

01:03.231 --> 01:06.895
- Right. That Turkish mud that you like.
- It'll get you going.

01:07.068 --> 01:10.851
It'll eat a hole in your stomach lining.

01:13.614 --> 01:16.152
- It's all right if-?
- Yeah. You can use the bathroom.

01:16.325 --> 01:19.823
- I was just going to take a shower.
- I'll only take a minute.

01:57.315 --> 01:58.774
Susan?

01:59.109 --> 02:00.603
- It's John.
- Carter.

02:00.777 --> 02:02.105
- Time to get-
- Carter?

02:02.278 --> 02:05.112
Hey. I was just trying to wake you up
on your machine.

02:05.280 --> 02:09.407
- I'm up.
- I brought coffee. I brought bagels.

02:11.285 --> 02:13.610
We were gonna catch
the 7:30 yoga, right?

02:13.787 --> 02:16.159
Oh, I forgot. I'm sorry.

02:18.458 --> 02:20.450
You're out early.

02:20.626 --> 02:22.452
I was over at Mark's.

02:22.627 --> 02:25.747
- Mark Greene?
- He's having some trouble.

02:25.922 --> 02:27.878
I spent the night.

02:28.924 --> 02:31.212
On the couch.

02:33.010 --> 02:36.544
Come on up. I'll take a shower,
and then we'll go, okay?

02:37.097 --> 02:38.805
Are you coming?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.753
He's a friend.

03:31.921 --> 03:34.495
- A good friend, I guess.
- Oh, would you drop it?

03:34.675 --> 03:36.882
Lonely too, with Elizabeth moving out.

03:36.969 --> 03:38.000
Nothing happened!

03:38.179 --> 03:40.338
Were you gonna tell me
that you went over there?

03:40.515 --> 03:42.058
I hadn't thought about it.

03:42.226 --> 03:45.846
Something you don't want me to know.
Something you don't wanna tell me.

03:46.022 --> 03:49.060
This petty, sarcastic side of you
is not appealing.

03:49.235 --> 03:51.941
Oh, right. You'd be cool
if I spent the night over at...

03:52.114 --> 03:53.775
Abby's?

03:54.158 --> 03:56.400
Not Abby's. I was gonna say Darla's.

03:56.578 --> 04:00.363
- Darla? Who the hell is Darla?
- Radiology.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.665
The one with the collagen lips
and the fake...?

04:04.046 --> 04:06.123
They're not fake, are they?

04:06.299 --> 04:08.092
- You were going to say Abby.
- I wasn't.

04:08.260 --> 04:10.253
- Yes, you were.
- So now you can read my mind?

04:10.430 --> 04:14.013
Well, it's not much of a challenge.
But if you were at Abby's, I'd kill you.

04:14.184 --> 04:16.289
- That's a double standard.
- No, it's not.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.433
I'm not attracted to him.

04:17.522 --> 04:18.988
- You are attracted to Abby.
- You were attracted to Mark.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.983
He was attracted to me. Thanks
for not denying you're attracted to Abby.

04:22.154 --> 04:23.434
How'd this become about me?

04:23.529 --> 04:25.819
You spent the night
at an old boyfriend's house.

04:25.992 --> 04:28.828
He's not my old boyfriend.
He's like an older brother.

04:28.996 --> 04:32.200
- And I don't want to sleep with him.
- I don't want to sleep with Abby.

04:32.291 --> 04:34.241
Susan, John, take this one.

04:34.376 --> 04:35.605
Got a head injury on a vent...

04:35.640 --> 04:38.245
I'm not on for 10 minutes.
Tell me this is an easy one.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.508
Cruella De Vil here had this guy
trussed up in some sort of love swing...

04:41.679 --> 04:45.631
- ... suspended from the ceiling.
- The guy swore to me he weighed 275.

04:45.810 --> 04:48.646
The torture swing
is guaranteed to 350 pounds.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.937
He pulled the screws out of my ceiling!

04:51.025 --> 04:52.056
He's 450 pounds.

04:52.151 --> 04:54.144
Grab on. I ruptured a disc getting him.

04:54.236 --> 04:55.317
Gallant, get over here.

04:55.489 --> 04:57.529
Just when you think
you've seen it all.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.492
- It hurts!
- What's he trying to say?

04:59.661 --> 05:01.286
He said, "It hurts. "

05:01.997 --> 05:04.323
- Why is the mask still on?
- Refused to take it off.

05:04.501 --> 05:07.827
40-year-old male, 6-foot fall to his
buttocks. Pelvic pain, can't walk.

05:08.005 --> 05:10.331
- BP's 160/95, pulse, 110.
- What's your name, sir?

05:10.509 --> 05:12.336
- No! No name!
- Do you know where you are?

05:12.511 --> 05:14.255
- A hospital?
- Frank, what's open?

05:14.430 --> 05:16.507
- Trauma 1.
- Everything he's wearing is mine.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.427
You cut it, you buy it.

05:18.602 --> 05:20.014
Hey, Malik, Abby. You guys free?

05:20.104 --> 05:22.512
CBC, dip a urine, portable chest, pelvis.

05:22.983 --> 05:24.228
- What is that?
- A tail.

05:24.402 --> 05:27.937
Careful. It's attached. Pure horsehair.
That's mine too.

05:28.114 --> 05:30.653
Check his chest.
I need you to take your hood off, sir.

05:30.744 --> 05:32.901
- No!
- I need to check your eyes and ears.

05:32.996 --> 05:35.452
- Use the little flaps.
- All right. Any pain here, sir?

05:35.625 --> 05:37.203
- No.
- Sinus tach.

05:37.377 --> 05:38.955
How about in here?

05:39.296 --> 05:40.708
- Okay.
- No hemotympanum.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.625
Pulse ox is 98 on room air.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.798
Pupils equal and reactive.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.174
Chest is clear. No rhonchi.

05:48.350 --> 05:50.888
- Knees up.
- Buck up, wimp!

05:51.062 --> 05:54.063
- Am I paralyzed?
- No. You probably bruised your butt.

05:54.232 --> 05:57.234
- We'll take some x-rays to make sure.
- Take your outfit off.

05:57.404 --> 06:00.192
- The zippers screw up the x-ray.
- Can I keep my hood?

06:00.574 --> 06:02.615
- Sure.
- What's going on in here?

06:02.785 --> 06:04.246
Titrate 10 of morphine.

06:04.955 --> 06:06.700
- Careful.
- Is that a tail?

06:06.874 --> 06:09.283
Pure horsehair. It's attached.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.294
- Is your hand all right?
- Fatso fell on me.

06:14.467 --> 06:18.252
That's dislocated. I should get an x-ray
of this before I try and reduce it.

06:18.430 --> 06:21.599
I'm not leaving.
He's got $2000 worth of my stuff.

06:21.769 --> 06:23.643
I can do it here. It's gonna hurt.

06:23.730 --> 06:25.937
You'll have to wear
a splint for six weeks.

06:26.108 --> 06:27.437
Can I wear it over my glove?

06:27.609 --> 06:30.446
You can file for workmen's comp.
It's a job-related injury.

06:30.614 --> 06:33.236
- Sure. It'll fit over your glove.
- Then do it.

06:33.409 --> 06:35.283
This is really gonna hurt.

06:35.954 --> 06:40.582
All right. Here we go.
One, two, three.

06:43.297 --> 06:45.416
- All yours.
- What about my hood?

06:45.551 --> 06:48.503
Go with him. We'll x-ray that finger,
make sure there's no fracture.

06:48.679 --> 06:50.802
Malik, hand series.

06:55.063 --> 06:57.815
Show's over, people.
Go back to work.

06:58.150 --> 07:02.612
- So what was the tail attached to?
- Believe me, you don't wanna know.

07:02.781 --> 07:04.324
We should have sold tickets.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.651
Hey, what's this?

07:07.078 --> 07:09.321
- I think it's hers.
- The mistress of pain?

07:09.499 --> 07:12.535
After all that bitching about her stuff,
she left her bag here?

07:12.710 --> 07:14.170
What's she have in this thing?

07:14.338 --> 07:15.583
- I don't wanna know.
- I do.

07:15.755 --> 07:17.631
- I'll take it to her.
- Take a look first.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.592
- No, let's just take a peek.
- No.

07:19.761 --> 07:22.087
- Not particularly.
- You guys are boring.

07:22.265 --> 07:24.471
Hey, you need me anymore,
Dr. Carter?

07:26.687 --> 07:28.681
Oh, my God!

07:29.065 --> 07:32.352
Nobody could ever actually use that,
could they?

07:32.528 --> 07:34.985
- What is that? Is that a-?
- Yeah, I think so.

07:35.157 --> 07:36.948
What?

07:38.244 --> 07:41.199
Come on, guys.
This is a patient's personal property.

07:41.373 --> 07:43.165
- Oh, God.
- No kidding.

07:43.334 --> 07:45.162
What's this? What's this for?

07:48.674 --> 07:52.045
- That is disgusting.
- That is disgusting.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.675
- Gallant, catch.
- No!

07:58.520 --> 08:02.306
What is that big purple thing? Oh, no!

08:02.401 --> 08:04.727
Oh, my God! Is that an on/off switch?

08:12.413 --> 08:15.119
That does not occur in nature.

08:16.628 --> 08:18.751
This is scary.

08:19.089 --> 08:22.376
- Oh, Carter? Come on. Try it on.
- Get away from me with that.

08:22.552 --> 08:24.676
No.
I promise I won't tighten the strap.

08:24.847 --> 08:26.971
What do you think?
Should I quit my day job?

08:27.141 --> 08:29.099
Dr. Kovac-

08:33.567 --> 08:36.105
Do you have any idea
what kind of financial liability...

08:36.279 --> 08:38.318
...you could've opened
this hospital up to?

08:38.490 --> 08:41.111
What if I'd been a patient
who just happened to walk in?

08:41.284 --> 08:44.866
- Kerry, we were just blowing off steam.
- Yeah? Well, do it on your own time!

08:45.458 --> 08:47.202
And with a medical student
in the room?

08:47.377 --> 08:50.378
What were you thinking?
Were you thinking at all?

08:50.714 --> 08:52.791
Who does this belong to?

08:52.967 --> 08:55.672
Did someone bring this thing
into the workplace?

08:56.180 --> 08:59.135
I think that we're all aware
that our behavior was inappropriate.

08:59.310 --> 09:02.145
Inappropriate, unprofessional, offensive.

09:02.230 --> 09:05.350
Who does this belong to?

09:10.950 --> 09:12.658
A patient.

09:15.122 --> 09:18.159
- A patient.
- We treated her for a dislocated finger.

09:18.335 --> 09:20.079
But she left her bag.

09:20.254 --> 09:24.086
So you decided it would be fun
to pilfer through a patient's belongings?

09:24.258 --> 09:28.127
Dr. Kovac, you're a Senior Attending. Do
you have anything to say for yourself?

09:31.267 --> 09:33.177
Dr. Lewis?

09:33.812 --> 09:35.771
Abby?

09:37.151 --> 09:39.310
- We're all sorry.
- Damn right you're sorry.

09:40.905 --> 09:42.364
I'll contact Human Resources,

09:42.490 --> 09:44.282
try to get them
not to convene a hearing...

09:44.452 --> 09:48.543
...which this department can ill afford
right now. I'm putting you all on notice.

09:48.678 --> 09:52.160
I will not tolerate another episode
of inappropriate behavior from anyone.

09:52.337 --> 09:53.749
Is that clear?

09:56.051 --> 09:58.340
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

10:01.307 --> 10:03.467
Get this thing
back to its rightful owner.

10:03.644 --> 10:07.939
And let's hope she doesn't notice
her belongings have been disturbed.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.148
- Thanks a lot, girls.
- For what?

10:11.320 --> 10:13.314
I asked you not to touch that bag.

10:13.490 --> 10:15.614
You could've left.
No one was keeping you here.

10:15.785 --> 10:18.323
Carter's right. We didn't want to open it.
You two did.

10:18.497 --> 10:21.284
I wonder what she's
saying to him in there.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.415
Well, we should have told her
that Gallant wasn't involved.

10:24.588 --> 10:27.258
You should have told her
that Luka and I weren't involved.

10:27.425 --> 10:30.000
Were you that kid in elementary school
who always told?

10:30.179 --> 10:33.133
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm great.

10:34.685 --> 10:37.093
- She moved out?
- Yeah. That's the rumor.

10:37.271 --> 10:39.644
- No rumor. Shirley told me.
- How would Shirley know?

10:39.816 --> 10:42.771
She changed her number
on the surgical emergency-contact sheet.

10:42.903 --> 10:45.729
- Over what happened with their girl?
- That is so sad.

10:45.866 --> 10:46.897
Did she move all her stuff out?

10:46.992 --> 10:48.985
They weren't right for each other.

10:49.162 --> 10:51.998
- She's too much woman for him.
- Hey! If you ladies are done...

10:52.165 --> 10:54.290
...with the stitch and bitch,
can I work?

10:54.460 --> 10:56.039
I'm surprised it lasted this long.

10:56.213 --> 10:57.791
- Poor Mark.
- It's really too bad.

10:57.965 --> 10:59.957
Has Psych been down
to see the woman in 6?

11:00.135 --> 11:01.166
Barker? No.

11:01.344 --> 11:04.381
She tried to bite one of the
Salvadorian sisters from Housekeeping.

11:04.556 --> 11:08.146
Chandra from Human Resources called,
said she'd be upstairs for an hour.

11:08.181 --> 11:10.600
Tell Dr. Kovac I'll be upstairs.
He can page me.

11:10.773 --> 11:13.561
Kerry, can I talk to you
about what happened this morning?

11:13.735 --> 11:15.895
I'm heading up to Human Resources
right now.

11:16.071 --> 11:20.321
Well, I think it's only right to tell you
that I was really the instigator.

11:20.786 --> 11:24.239
Carter, Gallant, Kovac, they were
all opposed to me opening that bag.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.410
What about Abby?

11:28.087 --> 11:31.838
It was me. If there's gonna be
any disciplinary consequences...

11:32.010 --> 11:35.510
- ... I should be the one held responsible.
- I appreciate you coming forward.

11:35.680 --> 11:39.384
But they're adults. They could've chose
to leave the room or not participate.

11:39.561 --> 11:43.856
I mean, when I entered, it was clear
that everyone present was involved.

11:45.945 --> 11:47.736
Anything else?

11:47.906 --> 11:49.780
No, that's it.

12:04.134 --> 12:06.212
Excuse me.
Do you know where Room 224 is?

12:06.387 --> 12:09.010
- End of the hall, on your left.
- Thank you.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.856
I thought I was late.

12:21.492 --> 12:23.151
You are late.

12:26.456 --> 12:28.782
Does anyone know how long
this is supposed to last?

12:28.959 --> 12:30.702
All day, I think.

12:32.631 --> 12:34.505
What are they gonna do,
show us videos?

12:34.675 --> 12:36.917
Sexual-harassment videos.

12:37.387 --> 12:40.971
Role-playing and long lectures
is what I heard.

12:41.517 --> 12:42.847
Role-playing?

12:43.020 --> 12:45.263
Acting out inappropriate behavior.

12:46.024 --> 12:49.144
- You two should excel at that.
- Would you drop it?

12:49.320 --> 12:50.945
No. I won't drop it.

12:51.114 --> 12:54.364
Yeah. Well, at least I'm not the one
who put that thing in her locker.

12:54.534 --> 12:57.074
- Right.
- I didn't.

12:59.124 --> 13:00.951
Don't look at me.

13:03.088 --> 13:04.748
Luka?

13:13.309 --> 13:15.848
But you should have seen her face.

13:16.146 --> 13:18.555
God, I wish I'd had a camera!

13:19.526 --> 13:21.270
This isn't funny.

13:21.487 --> 13:22.898
Sure, it is.

13:24.449 --> 13:25.731
No, it's not.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.994
This is gonna be a very long day.

13:45.965 --> 13:48.539
- I think that's Whitman.
- What?

13:48.718 --> 13:51.753
Well, somebody erased most of it.
But...

13:51.929 --> 13:55.132
To be surrounded by beautiful
Curious, breathing, laughing

13:55.307 --> 13:58.474
- That's " I Sing the Body Electric. "
- Oh, yeah. I know that one.

13:58.644 --> 14:00.470
You know Whitman?

14:02.564 --> 14:05.814
- Don't sound so surprised.
- No. Just most people don't.

14:06.026 --> 14:09.441
Yeah. Well, Fame.
You know, the movie. It was in that.

14:09.613 --> 14:13.729
Please! I love Fame. I've seen it,
like, 30 times. I wanted to be Coco.

14:20.999 --> 14:24.202
How long are we gonna wait? This thing
was supposed to start at 8:00.

14:24.377 --> 14:26.417
Probably got held up by the snow.

14:26.587 --> 14:27.832
We all got here.

14:33.553 --> 14:36.257
- I say we go.
- I say we wait.

14:37.974 --> 14:39.432
He speaks?

14:39.975 --> 14:44.553
So what if he's late? We were told
to report to Room 224 at 0800.

14:45.021 --> 14:49.305
I'm here. And I'm gonna stay here until
someone in charge tells me otherwise.

14:49.484 --> 14:51.892
And I suggest you all do the same.

14:52.070 --> 14:56.020
0800. This ain't the Marines, Gallant.
At ease.

14:56.199 --> 14:57.943
- It's the Army, Dr. Carter.
- Yeah?

14:58.118 --> 15:01.946
I don't think anybody will court-martial
you because the guy didn't show up.

15:02.121 --> 15:04.363
Gallant's right. We should wait.

15:04.540 --> 15:07.210
I don't want to have to come
here again next Saturday.

15:10.671 --> 15:13.376
Abby! Please!
We're in a public building.

15:14.383 --> 15:16.008
I know. Nobody's here.

15:17.470 --> 15:19.011
I'm here.

15:22.683 --> 15:24.391
Maybe this is the punishment.

15:24.893 --> 15:26.637
Sitting in this room.

15:26.812 --> 15:30.015
Maybe they're watching us
to see how we all respond.

15:30.191 --> 15:32.313
- Like a test?
- Sure.

15:32.484 --> 15:35.650
Hidden cameras recording us
for research or something.

15:35.821 --> 15:39.023
Watching to see how we react to
the stress. How alliances grow.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.951
How our social structures
break down under pressure.

15:42.118 --> 15:43.778
Like on Survivor.

15:43.953 --> 15:46.871
- You watch Survivor?
- Yeah. It's a great show.

15:49.751 --> 15:53.914
All the backbiting and the lying.
It's human nature at its most venal.

15:54.089 --> 15:56.757
Reality TV, one of the
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

15:56.925 --> 15:59.676
- Have you ever watched it?
- No.

16:00.762 --> 16:02.303
Then shut up.

16:05.557 --> 16:08.685
- I have a confession to make.
- You put the dildo in Weaver's locker?

16:10.938 --> 16:14.602
- I watch Fear Factor.
- Oh, my God! I love that show.

16:14.775 --> 16:18.475
Did you see the last one, where they
were bobbing for apples with the...?

16:18.654 --> 16:21.489
And the snakes were climbing
into their hair and their mouths!

16:21.656 --> 16:24.361
I thought that television
was just a vast wasteland.

16:24.534 --> 16:27.784
Oh, I'm sorry. I meant to watch
La Bohème on PBS last night...

16:27.954 --> 16:30.077
...but I had to go to the symphony.

16:30.748 --> 16:34.081
I watch television.
Just not that dehumanizing crap.

16:34.585 --> 16:36.708
I mean, seriously, what's next?
Televised executions,

16:36.796 --> 16:38.623
bearbaiting, Torture Channel?

16:38.798 --> 16:41.668
What is your problem today?
What are you so pissy about?

16:42.010 --> 16:44.133
You know what my problem is.

16:44.303 --> 16:46.047
You are kidding me. Still?

16:46.221 --> 16:48.214
- What?
- You are still mad about that?

16:48.390 --> 16:52.009
- You know what? Grow up.
- What? Oh, come on. Say it.

16:55.522 --> 16:59.520
I spent the night at Mark's the night
before last, and he won't let it go.

16:59.693 --> 17:02.796
I slept on the sofa. I was on the couch.
He thinks I slept with Mark.

17:02.872 --> 17:05.759
- Don't talk about this here.
- Years ago he had a crush on me.

17:05.833 --> 17:09.983
Now we're friends. More than I'll
be able to say about us if you keep it up.

17:10.161 --> 17:13.826
Yeah. Okay. A harmless night spent
in a recently single man's apartment...

17:13.998 --> 17:16.703
...who's still
desperately in love with you!

17:16.876 --> 17:19.627
- Mark is not in love with me.
- Who's recently single?

17:20.171 --> 17:21.795
- Greene. Corday left him.
- When?

17:21.964 --> 17:23.423
- Couple weeks ago.
- Where was I?

17:23.590 --> 17:27.209
It was an emergency. I wouldn't have
gone over if he didn't really need me.

17:27.386 --> 17:30.803
- Well, if he really needed you.
- He's a friend. I helped him out.

17:31.682 --> 17:34.641
- I'm sure you did.
- Not discussing this with you anymore.

17:34.810 --> 17:37.266
- What kind of emergency?
- None of your damn business!

17:40.065 --> 17:41.939
Are they getting a divorce?

17:42.109 --> 17:45.395
I don't think so. You know, when
you find out why I was over there...

17:45.570 --> 17:47.895
- ... you are going to feel very small.
- So tell me.

17:48.073 --> 17:50.646
- Very, very small.
- So tell me!

17:50.826 --> 17:54.693
Abby's been sleeping on my couch.
Nothing's happened.

18:03.588 --> 18:06.589
Yeah. I needed a place to stay
until I found a new apartment.

18:06.757 --> 18:08.382
And Luka...

18:09.177 --> 18:11.004
...said I could stay with him.

18:12.722 --> 18:15.427
You're more upset about that
than my staying at Mark's.

18:15.599 --> 18:17.259
- What?
- No. I'm not.

18:17.434 --> 18:18.715
Carter's still stuck on you.

18:18.894 --> 18:21.017
All right.
Can we change the subject, please?

18:21.188 --> 18:23.430
Now you wanna change the subject.

18:30.364 --> 18:32.570
How about them Bears, huh?

18:32.741 --> 18:34.319
What?

18:34.659 --> 18:36.118
Football?

18:36.286 --> 18:38.742
I don't watch American football.

18:40.332 --> 18:42.787
Well, they need
to beef up their defense.

18:42.959 --> 18:45.332
But I think they'll be
real contenders next year.

18:45.503 --> 18:48.420
I watch basketball.
Let's talk about the Bulls.

18:48.881 --> 18:50.293
The Bulls stink.

18:52.635 --> 18:54.462
How long were you in the Army,
Gallant?

18:56.472 --> 18:59.045
I'm still in the Army. Reserves.

18:59.308 --> 19:03.811
- They're paying for my med school.
- So they can call you up at any time?

19:05.064 --> 19:08.978
Yeah, they can.
I don't think they will. Not yet.

19:09.568 --> 19:10.979
You're not worried?

19:11.153 --> 19:13.940
- I'd be fine if they did.
- With everything that's going on?

19:16.658 --> 19:20.324
I wish they would give me a gun,
put me someplace where I could use it.

19:20.871 --> 19:23.196
I'm ready to go if my country
needs me. Yes, ma'am.

19:24.916 --> 19:27.205
- Luka was in the army. Right?
- Yeah?

19:27.377 --> 19:30.662
All Croatian men are required
to serve in the military.

19:32.132 --> 19:34.801
My brother Eric's in the Air Force.
He's in Saudi Arabia.

19:34.968 --> 19:37.803
- He a pilot?
- No. He's an air-traffic controller.

19:37.970 --> 19:39.216
I worry anyway.

19:39.389 --> 19:42.223
My brother Gavin's in the Air Force.
Munitions specialist.

19:42.391 --> 19:44.467
- Is he overseas?
- No, Texas.

19:44.643 --> 19:47.598
But he thinks they're going.
My younger brother Frank...

19:47.772 --> 19:49.231
...is in the Marines at Pendleton.

19:49.315 --> 19:51.106
My sister Carol's on the Carl Vinson.

19:51.275 --> 19:54.643
- How many siblings do you have?
- Six.

19:54.820 --> 19:57.109
- All in the service?
- Everybody who's old enough.

19:57.656 --> 20:00.860
- Steve, he's only 14.
- Patriotic bunch.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.195
It's the family business.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.825
My father's got 26 years
in as an NCO.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.699
That's only five.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.289
You only named five kids.
You said there were six in your family.

20:13.797 --> 20:15.255
Yeah. My twin sister, Susan.

20:15.841 --> 20:18.676
She's the black sheep.
Teaches Head Start in D.C.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.421
That's disgraceful.

20:20.595 --> 20:22.338
Yeah.
We hide it when company comes.

20:22.514 --> 20:26.297
How did she stay out of the military?
Sounds like a prerequisite in your family.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.718
She has cerebral palsy.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.943
What does your dad do, Dr. Lewis?

20:42.116 --> 20:43.907
- My dad?
- Yeah.

20:44.075 --> 20:46.614
He's a test pilot for Barcalounger.

20:47.954 --> 20:50.493
He sits all day in front of the TV trying...

20:50.582 --> 20:52.740
to get his cholesterol level over 400.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.832
- Is he succeeding?
- He's dedicated.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.795
He'll get there or die trying.

21:00.758 --> 21:02.881
What does your dad do, Dr. Kovac?

21:03.052 --> 21:06.504
My father is a painter.
Not houses, art.

21:06.681 --> 21:09.766
- Abstracts mostly. He's good.
- Really?

21:09.934 --> 21:13.303
Yeah. I mean, not that he's ever
made a living at it.

21:14.021 --> 21:16.891
He's a train conductor in Zagreb.
So that pays the bills.

21:18.276 --> 21:21.146
- I didn't know that.
- You never asked.

21:23.989 --> 21:25.484
Abby?

21:27.034 --> 21:30.403
Oh, I have absolutely no idea
what my father is doing.

21:30.579 --> 21:32.904
Okay. Dr. Carter?

21:34.040 --> 21:35.665
- What?
- What does your dad do?

21:37.419 --> 21:39.078
Spends the family trust fund.

21:42.591 --> 21:45.259
He manages several
of my family's investment funds.

21:45.427 --> 21:48.214
- Sits on some corporate boards.
- Family investment funds?

21:48.847 --> 21:50.590
Carter's loaded.

21:50.765 --> 21:52.592
Really?

21:53.685 --> 21:55.428
How loaded?

21:55.937 --> 21:58.309
- Think Bill Gates.
- Not that rich.

21:58.481 --> 22:00.852
Okay. Paul Allen, then.

22:02.151 --> 22:04.108
How much are you worth, Carter?

22:04.278 --> 22:06.105
Me, personally? Almost nothing.

22:07.114 --> 22:09.486
Okay. Your family, then.

22:09.658 --> 22:11.568
I have no idea.

22:13.287 --> 22:14.865
Guess.

22:15.956 --> 22:19.574
- I don't know. A lot.
- Fifty million?

22:20.961 --> 22:22.419
A hundred million?

22:26.633 --> 22:28.673
Two hundred million?

22:29.344 --> 22:30.624
Five hundred million?

22:31.763 --> 22:34.800
- Honestly, I don't know.
- Oh, my God! I knew you were rich.

22:34.974 --> 22:37.263
I didn't know you were that rich.

22:38.102 --> 22:40.260
- Gamma's money.
- How old are you, 30?

22:40.355 --> 22:42.717
- Thirty-one.
- How did you last this long...

22:42.752 --> 22:45.741
...without some girl marrying you?

22:48.321 --> 22:52.021
We come with a built-in gold-digger
alarm. Gamma installs them at birth.

22:52.199 --> 22:55.615
And I haven't set it off?
You better have that thing checked.

22:56.579 --> 22:57.693
It's embarrassing.

22:57.871 --> 23:00.872
Everybody assumes when you
grow up with money, everything's great.

23:01.041 --> 23:05.367
Must be hard growing up in a mansion.
Was Gamma too cheap to heat the pool?

23:06.505 --> 23:10.123
- Money isn't everything, Susan.
- That's easy for you to say.

23:10.299 --> 23:13.301
We never had much. You know,
always struggled, but we were happy.

23:13.470 --> 23:16.091
Yeah. Same here. I never knew
we didn't have money.

23:16.264 --> 23:19.965
I always had everything I needed.
Presents at Christmas, clothing, food.

23:20.143 --> 23:21.423
Seven hundred million.

23:23.354 --> 23:26.106
Hey, I didn't ask to be born into this.

23:30.736 --> 23:32.646
Is this the sexual-harassment group?

23:34.532 --> 23:37.319
- Yeah.
- Dr. Taylor called. He is coming.

23:37.492 --> 23:42.197
He's having car trouble. He asks you
to wait. He'll be here as soon as he can.

23:46.752 --> 23:48.409
Great.

24:02.140 --> 24:03.635
I wonder what's in there.

24:04.852 --> 24:06.345
What are you doing?

24:06.519 --> 24:10.303
This worked in college when
I locked myself out of my dorm room.

24:12.232 --> 24:15.566
They didn't have much.
Candy and sodas. No coffee.

24:18.530 --> 24:20.855
- Anybody want the root beer?
- It's all yours.

24:21.032 --> 24:24.697
Peanut-butter crackers. I love those.
Want to share them?

24:24.869 --> 24:27.441
Sure. What's he doing?

24:28.705 --> 24:31.575
- Breaking and entering.
- Why?

24:36.212 --> 24:38.785
- What's that play?
- What play?

24:38.964 --> 24:42.298
The one with two clowns who wait
for that guy who never shows up?

24:42.467 --> 24:43.712
Waiting for Godot?

24:44.136 --> 24:48.085
Yeah. I saw that at the Goodman
years ago. I didn't get it.

24:49.807 --> 24:52.380
It's about the futility of life
and human enterprise.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.636
You know, we're all waiting.
For what?

24:54.811 --> 24:57.267
Fulfillment, love, validation, approval?

24:58.315 --> 24:59.974
It's a waste of time.

25:00.149 --> 25:02.226
Life is an empty, hollow exercise...

25:02.401 --> 25:05.687
...filled with pain, loss and grief.
The only thing we can expect...

25:05.863 --> 25:09.527
...to achieve in our lives
is our own inevitable death.

25:12.952 --> 25:16.036
That is the most depressing thing
I've ever heard.

25:16.206 --> 25:17.829
Glad you didn't grow up in the Balkans?

25:18.207 --> 25:19.405
Croatia is beautiful.

25:20.208 --> 25:22.450
Zagreb, Dubrovnik. You should go.

25:22.628 --> 25:25.165
Kind of a high chance
of getting blown up, though.

25:25.338 --> 25:28.789
Always discourages me from adding
a country to my travel itinerary.

25:29.383 --> 25:31.375
It's very safe now.

25:31.885 --> 25:33.545
Then why are you here?

25:37.307 --> 25:40.842
Barbecue. You just can't find good ribs
in Zagreb, you know?

25:41.018 --> 25:43.426
Not to mention spoon bread
and sweet-potato pie.

25:43.604 --> 25:45.146
Carson's.

25:45.314 --> 25:46.773
Exactly.

25:47.107 --> 25:51.021
So how did you get into Weaver's locker,
Luka? It was locked.

25:53.404 --> 25:56.690
Oh, it wasn't me.

26:00.202 --> 26:03.037
No, I wish I thought of it.
I really do.

26:03.205 --> 26:05.908
But I didn't.

26:06.290 --> 26:07.950
Gallant?

26:08.125 --> 26:09.454
Clever.

26:09.627 --> 26:13.244
Very clever to accuse the rest of us
to throw suspicion away from yourself.

26:13.421 --> 26:15.212
You still haven't said
you didn't do it.

26:19.802 --> 26:21.960
Whitman was writing about slavery.

26:23.388 --> 26:24.633
He was an abolitionist.

26:26.642 --> 26:28.016
The poem, "Body Electric."

26:30.978 --> 26:33.979
I minored in English lit at Howard.

26:34.148 --> 26:35.606
Oh, yeah? I was English lit.

26:36.650 --> 26:38.275
- Where?
- Penn State.

26:38.443 --> 26:40.602
Really? You went to Penn State?

26:41.071 --> 26:44.190
Yes. Did you assume I went to
community college because I'm a nurse?

26:44.365 --> 26:46.987
- No. I didn't mean that.
- I think you did mean it.

26:47.159 --> 26:50.991
You did it before, about the poem.
It's all right. It's all of you, all doctors.

26:51.163 --> 26:54.117
You all think you're smarter than nurses
because you have an MD.

26:54.290 --> 26:56.579
Don't drag me into this, okay?

26:56.792 --> 26:59.034
- I don't assume that.
- You're still a med student.

26:59.212 --> 27:01.169
You'll learn to become condescending.

27:01.338 --> 27:03.247
It's a test you take
before you graduate.

27:03.507 --> 27:05.666
- I got an A.
- You got an A plus.

27:05.842 --> 27:08.838
- Does anybody have a penknife?
- That's not true of all doctors.

27:09.012 --> 27:10.471
Sure it is. It's a class thing.

27:10.638 --> 27:13.674
It's part of the educational caste
system we have in this country.

27:13.850 --> 27:16.893
Karl Marx went out of fashion
with black leather trench coats...

27:17.060 --> 27:20.305
- ... and the collapse of central planning.
- You look down on Gallant's family...

27:20.480 --> 27:23.729
...because they're military.
Like it's vaguely pathetic to volunteer...

27:23.900 --> 27:26.651
...to defend our liberties
with their lives for crappy pay.

27:26.819 --> 27:28.147
Yeah, that's true.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.727
- I don't feel that way.
- Really?

27:30.906 --> 27:32.764
I quit med school
halfway through my third year.

27:32.842 --> 27:35.033
I was second in my class when I quit.

27:35.201 --> 27:36.909
Second? I didn't know that.

27:38.287 --> 27:40.030
- Why did you quit?
- That's what I mean.

27:40.206 --> 27:42.957
You can't imagine why anybody
wouldn't want to be you.

27:43.876 --> 27:47.042
They tossed you out because
your ex-husband didn't pay your tuition.

27:47.212 --> 27:50.331
- Yeah, but I chose not to go back.
- Halfway through your third year?

27:50.506 --> 27:53.756
Why not finish? You finished the hard
part. It was starting to get fun.

27:53.926 --> 27:56.843
Because I realized I was proud
of what I do.

27:57.012 --> 28:00.591
- I make a difference in patients' lives.
- But you can do more as a doctor.

28:00.766 --> 28:04.679
No. See, that's where you're wrong.
I would be doing less as a doctor.

28:04.852 --> 28:07.521
You guys don't get to spend
any time with your patients.

28:07.688 --> 28:09.645
How many do you see a day, 30, 40?

28:11.566 --> 28:14.436
You don't get to hold a little kid's hand...

28:14.527 --> 28:16.650
or teach a new mother how to nurse.

28:16.821 --> 28:18.814
How many patients
do you see in a day?

28:19.031 --> 28:22.530
Ten, maybe 12. And I'm not running
around all day trying to clear the board.

28:22.701 --> 28:26.326
I made a choice. You can't understand
because it's not one you would choose.

28:26.496 --> 28:29.117
I can't believe
you won't let me smoke this!

28:30.958 --> 28:33.164
- I got it!
- Great. Now we're felons.

28:34.294 --> 28:35.837
- Oh, cool.
- What?

28:36.004 --> 28:38.080
There's a bunch of fencing gear
in here.

28:38.257 --> 28:40.498
- I used to fence in school.
- Of course you did.

28:40.675 --> 28:42.133
- I fence.
- Fencing?

28:42.302 --> 28:44.377
- Are you gonna eat this cracker?
- No.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.258
You really only see 10 patients a day?

28:49.099 --> 28:51.222
I learned when I was acting.

28:51.685 --> 28:54.140
- When were you an actor?
- In college.

28:59.691 --> 29:02.099
I should warn you. I'm good.

29:02.277 --> 29:03.937
Okay.

29:04.446 --> 29:06.984
- En garde.
- They really say that?

29:09.159 --> 29:11.067
That's a nice parry.

29:11.243 --> 29:15.406
- You think they're trying to impress us?
- If they are, it's not working.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.917
Doesn't that hurt?

29:34.013 --> 29:36.089
They really are a couple of freaks.

29:36.641 --> 29:40.968
- To think, you slept with both of them.
- I never slept with Carter.

29:41.144 --> 29:43.018
- Did he tell you that?
- I thought you had.

29:43.188 --> 29:44.682
No.

29:44.856 --> 29:46.600
That was a rumor Carter started.

29:47.483 --> 29:51.528
- Oh, God! He is low.
- I thought so.

29:57.117 --> 29:59.572
I haven't slept with Carter either.

30:00.536 --> 30:03.205
- How long you guys been going out?
- A couple months.

30:03.997 --> 30:06.536
Well, that definitely violates
the second-date rule.

30:06.709 --> 30:08.535
- What rule?
- My friend has this theory.

30:08.710 --> 30:10.453
You should sleep with a guy by
the second date. If it's not good...

30:10.545 --> 30:15.621
...you shouldn't waste time with
someone you don't have chemistry with.

30:15.799 --> 30:17.674
I don't know
if we have chemistry or not.

30:17.843 --> 30:20.250
There have been some
almost "spark" moments.

30:24.390 --> 30:29.052
I think it's either there or it's not.
You can't force it. Believe me, I've tried.

30:35.442 --> 30:39.309
Part of the problem with us is you.
He denies it but he's not convincing.

30:39.487 --> 30:41.562
Why didn't you two happen?

30:42.990 --> 30:44.235
Timing.

30:48.620 --> 30:50.327
You okay?

30:50.705 --> 30:52.781
- Yeah.
- If you're hurt, we should stop.

30:55.293 --> 30:56.786
No.

30:58.712 --> 31:00.372
Come on.

31:00.547 --> 31:02.706
Come on, let's go.

31:03.967 --> 31:07.252
- This is not going to end well.
- Hey, aren't you guys tired yet?

31:17.770 --> 31:19.976
Hey!

31:23.567 --> 31:25.607
- Hey!
- Oh, my God! Carter!

31:25.777 --> 31:27.320
- Dr. Carter!
- Knock it off!

31:27.487 --> 31:28.945
- Cut it out, Carter.
- All right!

31:29.114 --> 31:30.987
- You maniac!
- You started it!

31:31.157 --> 31:33.482
- Look at this! Look at this!
- You went for my face.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.533
After you hacked at my side!

31:35.703 --> 31:38.905
I always thought fencing
was a finesse sport. Sorry.

31:40.749 --> 31:42.741
Okay, let me see.

31:43.627 --> 31:45.619
- Don't be a baby.
- Crazy bastard.

31:47.087 --> 31:49.709
- He was trying to kill me.
- It looked like it was mutual.

31:49.882 --> 31:53.002
- Am I gonna need stitches?
- No, you barely need a Band-Aid.

31:53.176 --> 31:54.920
I didn't know you had a temper.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.636
I can ask Abby to come over here
and check you out if you'd prefer.

32:06.188 --> 32:07.432
What?

32:07.605 --> 32:11.140
That man is a menace.
That... and I could have lost my eye.

32:16.030 --> 32:17.773
What was that for?

32:17.948 --> 32:19.228
- Just checking.
- For what?

32:19.408 --> 32:21.400
Second-date rule.

32:21.951 --> 32:24.024
What?

32:55.698 --> 32:57.489
What?

32:57.658 --> 32:59.947
How did you
get Weaver's combination?

33:00.119 --> 33:02.242
Michael?
Sneak a look over her shoulder...

33:02.412 --> 33:05.579
...when she wasn't looking? When she
was opening it? It is Michael?

33:05.749 --> 33:07.078
Yeah. Michael.

33:08.502 --> 33:12.334
You knew the combination, so you snuck
in the lounge when no one was looking.

33:12.505 --> 33:14.961
- And you put it in there.
- Why would I do that?

33:15.133 --> 33:18.300
She said something that pissed you off
so much you wanted revenge.

33:18.470 --> 33:20.509
The quiet ones are always
the most dangerous.

33:20.680 --> 33:24.263
- I'm a student. I could get expelled.
- Still waters run deep.

33:24.434 --> 33:26.676
It wasn't me.

33:31.733 --> 33:33.856
Where were you living before?

33:34.485 --> 33:37.522
Scottsdale, Arizona. Land of sun.

33:37.697 --> 33:40.532
And you decided to move back
to Chicago?

33:41.951 --> 33:47.076
I don't know. The desert, 120 degrees
in the shade, never a cloud in the sky.

33:47.248 --> 33:48.955
Kind of depressed me.

33:49.125 --> 33:52.992
I needed to be back where the sun
doesn't come out for weeks!

33:53.170 --> 33:57.215
Bitter cold and overcast skies
better suit my temperament.

33:58.050 --> 34:00.505
But mostly I was running away.

34:00.677 --> 34:01.923
From what?

34:02.095 --> 34:05.346
- A guy. What else?
- Chemistry?

34:05.515 --> 34:07.638
A tanker truck full. Too much.

34:07.977 --> 34:11.428
- What was his name?
- Charlie Dixon. Dix.

34:11.605 --> 34:15.982
He's a cowboy. Can you believe it?
An honest-to-God cowboy.

34:16.150 --> 34:19.934
He has the horse, the pickup truck,
the whole deal.

34:20.322 --> 34:22.728
I'm a walking cliché.

34:22.991 --> 34:25.030
Was he cute?

34:26.745 --> 34:28.405
What happened?

34:29.871 --> 34:34.534
It's complicated. I'd rather not talk
about it if you don't mind.

34:38.965 --> 34:40.838
Cowboy.

34:48.933 --> 34:51.091
So you were in the army.

34:51.518 --> 34:54.389
- Yeah.
- You see some action?

34:57.649 --> 35:01.314
- Okay, sorry.
- It's not what you think it is.

35:01.654 --> 35:04.025
Well, what do you think I think it is?

35:04.573 --> 35:10.492
Noble. Romantic. A crucible
in which to test your young manhood.

35:11.204 --> 35:13.695
No, I'm not that naive.

35:16.292 --> 35:18.285
Sure you are.

35:18.586 --> 35:21.291
Luka, how old were you
when you became a man?

35:21.464 --> 35:23.124
- What?
- When you lost your virginity.

35:23.300 --> 35:25.043
How old were you?

35:26.553 --> 35:29.008
- We're playing a game. How old?
- I don't want to play.

35:29.180 --> 35:31.506
Oh, come on. We made a bet...

35:31.599 --> 35:33.556
...which one of the five of us
lost their virginity first.

35:33.726 --> 35:35.137
- Who'd you pick?
- Not telling.

35:35.310 --> 35:37.387
- I picked Kovac.
- No, she didn't.

35:39.648 --> 35:41.391
- Luka?
- I don't want to play.

35:41.567 --> 35:44.901
- I told you they wouldn't want to play.
- All right. I'll go first.

35:46.406 --> 35:48.197
I was 16.

35:48.365 --> 35:50.192
Howie Thomas.

35:50.659 --> 35:53.197
He was on the lacrosse team.
What's wrong with-? What?

35:53.370 --> 35:54.829
- Howie?
- What's wrong with that?

35:54.997 --> 35:57.702
He sounds like a plumber
or something.

35:57.874 --> 35:59.499
I was terrified.

35:59.668 --> 36:03.499
So was he. It was the longest
20 seconds of my life.

36:04.256 --> 36:07.874
- Twenty seconds?
- Yeah, if you count the foreplay.

36:08.719 --> 36:11.256
Okay. My turn.

36:11.430 --> 36:15.474
Mark Greene. No!
I'm just kidding. Just kidding, Carter.

36:16.059 --> 36:17.850
Floyd Walker. I was 15.

36:18.019 --> 36:20.510
Floyd? And you gave me
a hard time about Howie.

36:20.688 --> 36:23.061
In the shed behind
his father's radiator-repair shop.

36:23.232 --> 36:27.526
- Very romantic.
- The smell of antifreeze still turns me on.

36:28.613 --> 36:30.273
Gallant?

36:30.865 --> 36:33.617
You don't need their approval.
Come on, give it up.

36:34.536 --> 36:39.612
Okay. Tanya McBride, in the balcony
of our church after choir practice.

36:39.790 --> 36:41.333
- Wow!
- Your church?

36:41.500 --> 36:43.872
- Yeah, I know.
- How old?

36:44.045 --> 36:46.998
Let's see, I was in ninth grade,
so I was about 14.

36:47.172 --> 36:48.667
All right. We have a new leader.

36:50.968 --> 36:52.545
Carter?

36:54.096 --> 36:55.555
Come on.

36:55.723 --> 36:57.679
Oh, my God! You're still a virgin!

36:59.560 --> 37:02.893
- I was 11.
- Eleven years old?

37:03.063 --> 37:04.854
Really?

37:07.818 --> 37:09.691
How old was she?

37:10.236 --> 37:13.321
- I don't know. 25.
- You're kidding me.

37:13.573 --> 37:15.483
Oh, my God!

37:16.076 --> 37:18.068
She was one of the maids.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.907
- Did you pay her?
- My parents did.

37:21.081 --> 37:22.789
To have sex with you?

37:23.583 --> 37:25.576
To be a maid.

37:26.127 --> 37:28.499
I hope you gave her
a hell of a Christmas bonus.

37:29.713 --> 37:32.086
All right. Luka, 11.

37:32.258 --> 37:34.084
It's going to be very tough to beat.

37:35.886 --> 37:39.753
Don't say how old. Confirm you were
older than 11 and Carter wins the prize.

37:39.932 --> 37:42.423
- I get a prize?
- Don't let your imagination run away.

37:42.602 --> 37:44.759
My wedding night.

37:49.942 --> 37:52.777
I lost my virginity
on my wedding night.

37:55.238 --> 37:57.397
It's okay. It's a good memory.

37:57.575 --> 38:00.278
I hadn't thought about that in years.

38:04.831 --> 38:10.785
We were very young
and she was religious, so we waited.

38:12.714 --> 38:15.335
We loved each other very much.

38:18.303 --> 38:19.962
It's okay. It's okay.

38:32.691 --> 38:36.985
What were you in? You said you were an
actor in college. What plays were you in?

38:37.321 --> 38:38.602
We did Hamlet.

38:39.406 --> 38:40.901
I did Hamlet.

38:41.074 --> 38:42.319
I played Horatio.

38:42.743 --> 38:45.316
- Who did you play, Luka?
- Hamlet.

38:47.080 --> 38:49.157
In English or Croatian?

38:49.333 --> 38:50.992
Why would I do it in English?

38:51.710 --> 38:52.991
Were you any good?

38:53.837 --> 38:55.497
My mom thought so.

38:57.173 --> 38:59.166
Do you remember any of it?

38:59.676 --> 39:01.301
No, it's been a long time.

39:04.681 --> 39:06.424
I think I remember some of it.

39:09.185 --> 39:13.598
To be or not to be,
that is the question.

39:13.773 --> 39:18.400
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind's eye
to suffer the slings and arrows...

39:18.569 --> 39:20.443
...of outrageous fortune...

39:21.906 --> 39:24.658
...or to take arms
against a sea of troubles...

39:24.742 --> 39:26.533
...and by opposing end them.

39:26.703 --> 39:27.947
That's the easy part.

39:28.120 --> 39:32.332
To die, to sleep no more...

39:33.042 --> 39:35.746
...and by a sleep to say
we end the heartache...

39:35.919 --> 39:40.332
...and the thousand natural shocks...

39:41.717 --> 39:43.544
I don't remember the rest of it.

39:44.177 --> 39:46.300
To die, to sleep...

39:46.471 --> 39:48.547
...to sleep...

39:49.057 --> 39:53.186
...perchance to dream.
Ay, there's the rub.

40:47.906 --> 40:51.156
Be all my sins remember'd.

40:58.708 --> 41:00.286
Sorry I'm so damn late.

41:00.460 --> 41:02.748
I spent half an hour digging my car out,

41:02.837 --> 41:04.461
and then the battery was dead.

41:06.716 --> 41:11.093
I appreciate you waiting for me.
I didn't expect anyone to still be here.

41:11.263 --> 41:12.637
I'm John Taylor.

41:13.305 --> 41:16.472
Please, would everybody move
down front? I won't have to yell.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.267
Come on. Come on. I won't bite.

41:18.644 --> 41:22.226
Raise your hand when I call your name,
if you would.

41:22.857 --> 41:24.814
- John Carter.
- Here.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.309
- Michael Gallant?
- Gallant. Yes, sir.

41:27.486 --> 41:30.487
- Luka... Oh, boy. Help me out.
- Kovac.

41:30.656 --> 41:33.657
Dr. Kovac. Thank you. Susan Lewis.

41:34.452 --> 41:38.116
- And that leaves Abigail Lockhart?
- Abby.

41:38.705 --> 41:42.573
So let's begin by reviewing current state
and federal law for what is appropriate...

41:42.751 --> 41:44.993
...and inappropriate behavior
in the workplace.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.332
- Hey, it stopped snowing.
- It's about time.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.549
Anybody need a ride? I got my car.

41:53.636 --> 41:54.965
I'm on in 20 minutes.

41:55.138 --> 41:56.881
You're working tonight?

41:57.140 --> 41:59.179
Yeah? Me too.

41:59.684 --> 42:02.887
- Well, that was fun.
- Let's try to never do it again.

42:03.062 --> 42:05.185
You want me to give
you a lift to the hospital?

42:05.356 --> 42:06.555
It's a few blocks.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.223
- Gallant will walk me.
- Sure.

42:08.318 --> 42:11.023
- You have your keys?
- Yeah. I'll try not to wake you.

42:14.282 --> 42:15.859
See you guys later.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.322
I had fun talking.
We should have coffee sometime.

42:18.494 --> 42:19.988
Sure. I'd love that.

42:20.162 --> 42:21.491
- Ready?
- Yep.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.787
- Good night.
- Night.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.589
- She's pretty great.
- Who?

42:30.756 --> 42:33.959
Abby. I didn't know her before.
I didn't think I'd like her, but I do.

42:34.134 --> 42:36.257
You want to get something to eat?
I'm starving.

42:36.429 --> 42:38.754
You know, you really made a fool
of yourself today.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.722
- What?
- If you're worried about Abby...

42:40.891 --> 42:43.263
...living with Luka, don't be.
Nothing's going on.

42:43.435 --> 42:47.847
- How did I make a fool out of myself?
- Well, you participated in a duel...

42:48.023 --> 42:50.015
...for one thing.

42:54.028 --> 42:55.986
Kiss me.

42:57.824 --> 43:00.232
Just kiss me.

43:06.541 --> 43:08.165
Was it there for you?

43:10.002 --> 43:13.169
- It was nice.
- It wasn't there for me either.

43:17.009 --> 43:20.094
- Okay, go before I change my mind.
- You sure?

43:20.263 --> 43:21.591
I regret it already.

43:21.680 --> 43:25.014
That gold-digger alarm
should be clanging like a school bell.

43:25.184 --> 43:27.889
This isn't because Mark Greene
suddenly became available?

43:28.062 --> 43:32.141
Know when I said you were making a
fool of yourself? You're doing it again.

43:35.319 --> 43:38.439
- You should tell her.
- Who?

43:38.989 --> 43:41.196
- Tell her what?
- That you're in love with her...

43:41.366 --> 43:44.036
...and can't live a moment without her.

43:44.495 --> 43:45.905
Really?

43:47.163 --> 43:49.203
You're hopeless.

43:51.209 --> 43:52.953
You'll figure it out.

43:54.212 --> 43:55.457
Friends?

43:56.131 --> 43:58.289
No, I hate you.

44:02.137 --> 44:03.928
Hey.

44:04.263 --> 44:06.303
I used to have Weaver's locker.

44:06.474 --> 44:08.181
She never changed the combination.

44:09.602 --> 44:11.672
It was you!

44:58.728 --> 45:00.800
