WEBVTT

00:01.016 --> 00:02.991
In the criminal
justice system...

00:03.064 --> 00:04.558
sexually-based offenses

00:04.631 --> 00:06.158
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.616 --> 00:08.917
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives...

00:08.983 --> 00:10.674
who investigate
these vicious felonies...

00:10.743 --> 00:12.236
are members of an elite squad

00:12.311 --> 00:13.837
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.104 --> 00:15.925
These are their stories.

00:17.270 --> 00:20.238
The perp is Sgt. Frank Foster,
Brooklyn narcotics.

00:20.311 --> 00:22.896
His kid ran away. Her picture
turns up on this Web page.

00:22.965 --> 00:24.623
Guy who took it
won't say where she is.

00:25.141 --> 00:26.385
Who's the hostage?

00:26.452 --> 00:28.341
The guy who interviewed
his daughter.

00:28.404 --> 00:30.292
He films street kids
and puts them on the Web.

00:30.356 --> 00:31.851
Sgt. Foster's
state of mind?

00:31.925 --> 00:33.964
Wants his kid.
How many in the room?

00:34.067 --> 00:36.686
Four, plus the taker.
Two are his family.

00:36.947 --> 00:39.282
If it was my kid, I'd
probably do the same thing.

00:39.475 --> 00:40.937
We all might,
Lieutenant.

00:41.428 --> 00:43.566
Ready? We got him
on the monitor.

00:44.499 --> 00:46.091
Here you go.

00:47.859 --> 00:49.680
Sgt. Foster...

00:49.875 --> 00:52.875
this is Capt. Donald Cragen,
Special Victims Unit.

00:52.978 --> 00:53.926
Donny?

00:54.737 --> 00:56.974
Frank, don't do this.

00:57.650 --> 01:01.904
My gun is down. I'm not
a threat. Coming out.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.151 --> 01:13.900
This isn't over until I know
where my daughter is.

01:14.542 --> 01:18.602
I want her safe. It's
that, or you shoot me now.

01:28.877 --> 01:30.306
Thanks, Captain.

01:36.173 --> 01:39.304
He slaps me around. What's he gonna
do to his daughter if he finds her?

01:39.404 --> 01:40.810
We want her safe.

01:40.877 --> 01:42.402
She didn't feel safe
at home.

01:42.476 --> 01:43.620
She tell you that?

01:45.451 --> 01:47.142
You wanna see
what she told me?

01:53.323 --> 01:56.192
Mom, like, freaks about lipstick,
like purple's gonna kill me.

01:56.266 --> 01:58.687
Dad's like I don't exist. He
said I couldn't find my way...

01:58.762 --> 02:01.151
out of the neighborhood,
like I'm stupid or something.

02:01.225 --> 02:02.402
He beat you?

02:02.473 --> 02:03.848
He's like a cop.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.691
It sucks at my house.
My parents blow.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.727
She didn't run away for
nothing. She's afraid of him.

02:12.488 --> 02:16.416
Hey, Punk. What's up, Tito?
Pretty thing.

02:16.488 --> 02:18.145
Who's that?
You need some money?

02:18.216 --> 02:19.873
Kanick, bad news.

02:19.944 --> 02:22.311
Guy who runs raves.
Used to be hookers.

02:22.375 --> 02:26.848
Get high, get down.
Rainlight Rave, Saturday.

02:28.454 --> 02:30.015
Make $500.

02:30.694 --> 02:32.549
Tell us where she is.

02:32.614 --> 02:34.107
I don't know.

02:34.182 --> 02:36.418
She was hanging with these
kids who hang downtown.

02:36.709 --> 02:38.814
This capture's
in the meat-packing district.

02:41.413 --> 02:42.906
Your piece, Sergeant.

02:44.707 --> 02:48.668
You're not gonna kick this over to
missing persons. They did nothing.

02:50.564 --> 02:52.767
What's the alternative
here, Frank?

03:02.787 --> 03:03.735
Cuff him.

03:56.699 --> 03:58.805
Have a seat,
Captain.

03:59.163 --> 04:01.716
You understand this interview
will be recorded?

04:01.787 --> 04:02.736
I do.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.177
You're being questioned
pursuant to General Order 15...

04:05.242 --> 04:08.144
about serious irregularities
in the Foster investigation.

04:08.634 --> 04:11.950
Refusal to answer any questions
will result in immediate suspension.

04:12.026 --> 04:13.203
I understand.

04:13.273 --> 04:16.535
Are you waiving your right to have
a union delegate or attorney present?

04:16.632 --> 04:18.737
Yes. I have nothing
to hide.

04:18.969 --> 04:21.041
Then tell us your version
of what happened.

04:21.656 --> 04:25.583
I was the hostage negotiator on
call that day for the borough.

04:26.041 --> 04:28.276
Early afternoon
I was notified that...

04:28.344 --> 04:31.692
an armed man had taken hostages at
the offices of an Internet magazine.

04:31.831 --> 04:34.646
When did you first learn the
identity of the hostage taker?

04:34.710 --> 04:35.888
When I got there.

04:35.991 --> 04:38.925
It was Sgt. Frank Foster,
Brooklyn narcotics.

04:38.998 --> 04:40.460
You know Sgt. Foster?

04:40.822 --> 04:44.171
For more than 30 years, since
we went to the Academy together.

04:44.245 --> 04:46.067
But you already know this,
don't you?

04:46.230 --> 04:50.026
Is that why you failed to disarm Sgt.
Foster on your first contact with him?

04:50.324 --> 04:53.903
I assessed the situation, believed
that he was no threat to anybody...

04:53.973 --> 04:58.610
in that room. My assessment was correct.
We disarmed him without incident.

04:58.676 --> 05:01.043
After you allowed him to return
to the room with his weapon.

05:01.109 --> 05:03.759
You violated every rule
of hostage negotiation.

05:03.828 --> 05:06.249
I was not about to paint
a bull's-eye on a good cop.

05:06.356 --> 05:09.585
Frank Foster acted in the heat of
the moment. His daughter had run away.

05:09.650 --> 05:12.497
He was distraught, trying to find
her. He was not gonna hurt anybody.

05:12.563 --> 05:16.840
In your opinion, which certainly wasn't
objective in light of your friendship.

05:16.914 --> 05:18.573
You should have
recused yourself.

05:18.705 --> 05:21.640
Instead you proceeded on an investigation
that would normally have been...

05:21.714 --> 05:23.056
handled by Missing Persons.

05:23.121 --> 05:24.812
Jill Foster was
an underaged runaway...

05:24.882 --> 05:27.914
the daughter of a cop.
She was seen in the company...

05:27.985 --> 05:29.807
of a convicted
sex offender and pimp.

05:29.872 --> 05:32.458
That put the case
squarely on our turf.

05:32.592 --> 05:36.683
I reached out to Vice. They lent me Monique
Jeffries, one of my former detectives.

05:36.752 --> 05:39.620
Another detective on my squad,
Fin Tutuola, went undercover.

05:39.695 --> 05:42.761
And you consider your actions
normal operating procedure?

05:42.831 --> 05:46.180
There was nothing normal about
this case. It was a cop's daughter.

05:46.415 --> 05:48.106
What would you have done?

05:49.261 --> 05:52.261
Stay away from this guy.
We'll start with him.

05:52.462 --> 05:53.923
His name's Lance Kanick.

05:54.030 --> 05:56.330
Tito has him as a promoter
of Rainlight Raves.

05:56.397 --> 05:59.047
In '87 he was running
Ooo-Wee Escort Service...

05:59.245 --> 06:02.594
providing top-shelf drugs and
call girls to Wall Streeters.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.903
Beat one of his girls to death
with a tire iron.

06:04.971 --> 06:06.695
It's in the Crime Scene
Procedures text.

06:06.765 --> 06:09.928
Should have been doing life, but a rookie
contaminated the scene. Took a plea.

06:09.995 --> 06:10.944
Did seven.

06:11.020 --> 06:12.263
He's still dealing.

06:12.332 --> 06:16.357
Raves are where you score X, GHB,
ketamines. Big money for the dealers.

06:16.715 --> 06:19.170
X pays off better than
a thousand to one.

06:19.370 --> 06:22.719
Well, you know that world.
Munch, Fin, talk to Kanick.

06:22.986 --> 06:26.695
Olivia, Elliot, Tito offered to help.
Jeffries, you'll coordinate from here.

06:26.858 --> 06:29.704
And, guys, this is more than
just a favor to a fellow cop.

06:29.865 --> 06:33.280
Kanick takes young girls, turns them
into hookers. One hooker into a corpse.

06:33.353 --> 06:36.701
I want Jill Foster off the
street before either happens.

06:37.481 --> 06:41.473
Tito, this is Det. Benson.
Heard you wanted to help.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.673
Nobody's talking to you
and a mall queen.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.406
What about
the black chick?

06:46.471 --> 06:48.358
The black chick
has other duties.

06:50.311 --> 06:52.067
What's this about?

06:52.167 --> 06:54.915
This is how I capture runaway
images without them freaking.

06:57.861 --> 06:59.901
Nobody knows I have a camera.

06:59.974 --> 07:02.362
Well, I can keep a secret
if the mall queen can.

07:14.180 --> 07:15.707
You okay?

07:15.779 --> 07:17.755
Not gonna be okay
till they find Jill.

07:18.467 --> 07:21.369
Your union rep called me.
They're trying for ROR.

07:21.795 --> 07:25.024
What difference does it make? I
took hostages. It's over for me.

07:26.210 --> 07:27.158
Frank...

07:31.554 --> 07:35.448
we're friends. I stood up at your
wedding. Why didn't you call me?

07:36.321 --> 07:40.543
And tell you what? My daughter had it with
her lousy father and decided to take off?

07:40.608 --> 07:42.169
What would you have
thought of me then?

07:42.240 --> 07:44.476
That you need help.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.789
Every day I was out there
taking dope off the streets.

07:49.311 --> 07:50.740
Jill was putting it
up her nose.

07:50.815 --> 07:52.670
Smoking it,
popping pills, whatever.

07:52.767 --> 07:55.451
It was like she was intentionally
slapping me in the face.

07:55.519 --> 07:58.267
You're not the first cop
whose kid has a drug problem.

07:58.590 --> 07:59.964
Maybe not, but...

08:00.607 --> 08:04.316
I did what any parent with his head up
his ass would do. I made it about me.

08:04.957 --> 08:07.957
How's the narc gonna look if
he can't keep his own kid clean?

08:08.221 --> 08:11.569
You saved my ass that night when
we were rookies in East New York.

08:12.701 --> 08:16.661
Waited one second longer, I'm lying in a
box and we're never having this conversation.

08:19.772 --> 08:23.895
You know, you don't owe me
anything. You got something to ask...

08:25.019 --> 08:26.447
ask it.

08:30.555 --> 08:33.554
Did you in any way
abuse your daughter?

08:36.537 --> 08:38.227
I never touched her
physically.

08:39.354 --> 08:41.623
But I didn't respect her,
either.

08:42.457 --> 08:46.319
I called her loser junkie.
That's abuse, isn't it?

08:49.015 --> 08:53.325
I'll talk to our A.D.A., Alex
Cabot. Maybe she can help you.

08:56.439 --> 08:59.405
This isn't about me.
It's about Jill.

09:01.303 --> 09:03.539
Find her, Donny.

09:05.686 --> 09:06.635
Please.

09:10.102 --> 09:11.050
Yeah.

09:16.086 --> 09:18.028
Hey, wake up.
What?

09:18.101 --> 09:20.818
Lance Kanick.
He don't live here.

09:21.077 --> 09:22.767
This was his
last known address.

09:23.956 --> 09:27.404
Look, we got 48 mailboxes...

09:27.732 --> 09:29.674
and 46 apartments.

09:30.420 --> 09:32.143
Kanick rents
one of the extras.

09:32.210 --> 09:34.065
When's he pick up
his mail?

09:34.163 --> 09:36.268
Guys pick it up for him.

09:36.339 --> 09:38.128
They mention where he lives?

09:38.706 --> 09:42.055
All I know is,
he drives a big SUV.

09:42.226 --> 09:43.982
What's the license plate
number?

09:44.050 --> 09:46.505
That's one of my hobbies,
remembering license plates.

09:46.578 --> 09:48.584
You like to try
making them?

09:50.289 --> 09:53.159
It's a dark green Excursion.
I don't know the plate.

09:53.617 --> 09:54.729
He get much mail?

09:55.440 --> 09:57.928
See for yourself.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.022
Bank statement,
Cayman Islands.

10:10.734 --> 10:14.050
Banking in the Caribbean. Not
bad, six years out of Ossining.

10:16.046 --> 10:17.474
Have you seen this girl?

10:17.550 --> 10:19.273
Yesterday.
I remember the shirt.

10:19.566 --> 10:22.914
Was she with anybody?
Kids, like those.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.282
Cops.

10:28.204 --> 10:30.571
You guys can't help but
announce yourselves, can you?

10:30.637 --> 10:34.248
Look at this, an invitation to Rainlight
Raves, tomorrow night at 10:00 p. m...

10:34.315 --> 10:35.428
but it doesn't say where.

10:35.499 --> 10:36.579
There's an 800 number.

10:36.651 --> 10:39.401
You call the day of the rave. That's
when they tell you where it is.

10:39.467 --> 10:42.314
All right, let's worry about today.
Any of these kids recognize Jill?

10:42.378 --> 10:45.607
No, but they know Kanick. They
go to his raves, roll on his X.

10:45.674 --> 10:47.048
They can't afford it,
they barter.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.129
Barter what?

10:48.234 --> 10:49.826
Sex. What do you think?

10:49.994 --> 10:52.514
There's huge money
in barely legal teens.

10:53.385 --> 10:55.273
Hey, Ronnie.

10:57.673 --> 10:59.102
What's up, Tito?

10:59.177 --> 11:00.802
I'm looking
for this girl, Jill.

11:03.624 --> 11:06.559
She looks like a lot of them.
Anybody seen this girl, Jill?

11:18.438 --> 11:22.049
All right.
Why did you run?

11:23.237 --> 11:27.612
The girl, I think she's dead.

11:37.155 --> 11:40.025
Second floor in the rear.
Go.

11:52.386 --> 11:54.295
Shooting gallery stench.

11:56.162 --> 11:58.071
This will cover it.
No.

12:34.652 --> 12:37.173
The girl we found
wasn't Sgt. Foster's daughter.

12:37.245 --> 12:38.259
Who was she?

12:38.332 --> 12:40.023
Another throwaway kid.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.750
Did her death affect...

12:41.820 --> 12:43.314
the unit's decision-making
process?

12:43.388 --> 12:46.518
If you're asking, "Did we intensify
efforts to find Jill Foster?"

12:46.588 --> 12:47.570
The answer is yes.

12:47.643 --> 12:50.992
Your C.O. stated that you,
"Pulled out all the stops."

12:51.196 --> 12:52.372
What's your point?

12:52.570 --> 12:55.919
Thousands of kids on the street,
Detective. We can't save them all.

12:56.378 --> 12:59.444
Why did Jill Foster merit
so much extra attention?

12:59.513 --> 13:03.223
One runaway connected with Jill was
already dead. We didn't want another.

13:03.353 --> 13:06.834
Tell us, Det. Stabler, is it also
your practice to enlist civilians...

13:06.937 --> 13:08.660
to gather evidence
for your investigations?

13:08.729 --> 13:11.347
If you're referring
to Tito Frank, he volunteered.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.560
After you recruited him.

13:12.632 --> 13:15.795
Tito knew the scene.
His information was reliable.

13:15.864 --> 13:17.718
He wanted to help us
find Jill.

13:17.783 --> 13:20.052
Did you register him
as a confidential informant?

13:20.119 --> 13:21.974
No, but my C.O. knew about it.

13:22.039 --> 13:23.184
Did he clear it
with Intel?

13:23.255 --> 13:24.148
He didn't say.

13:24.215 --> 13:25.971
Did Capt. Cragen
give you other orders?

13:26.040 --> 13:29.387
He told us to find Jill
Foster, whatever it takes.

13:31.125 --> 13:33.428
Your Jane Doe is
approximately 14.

13:33.493 --> 13:36.144
OD'd on a pharmaceutical
cocktail particular to raves:

13:36.214 --> 13:38.188
crystal meth, ketamine, and X.

13:38.582 --> 13:42.126
I don't usually MRI an autopsy,
but this girl, I wanted a record.

13:42.326 --> 13:43.601
She was abused.

13:45.205 --> 13:47.856
Scar tissue her skull
has grown around.

13:48.181 --> 13:51.529
Recurring fractures:
skull, ribs, arms, femur.

13:51.987 --> 13:54.704
When nobody claims her,
I'll pay for a funeral.

13:55.284 --> 13:57.137
She was waxed, Detective.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.828
You mean like bikini wax?

13:58.899 --> 14:03.121
I mean, except for scalp and brow, she
was hairless: arms, legs, and pubis.

14:03.345 --> 14:05.234
Kiddie porn.

14:07.218 --> 14:10.086
There were six kids, and a guy
gave us money to party.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.727
Have sex?

14:11.792 --> 14:13.516
Yeah, for the camera.

14:13.586 --> 14:14.533
Sit down.

14:14.801 --> 14:16.939
Describe the man
who gave you money.

14:17.744 --> 14:19.816
I can't. It was dark
at the rave.

14:19.889 --> 14:22.255
Okay.
White, black?

14:22.320 --> 14:26.475
Black. But a white guy
drove us to the location.

14:26.894 --> 14:28.421
Where you had sex
for the camera?

14:28.495 --> 14:29.924
Yeah.

14:30.159 --> 14:32.581
Okay. What did
the white guy look like?

14:32.847 --> 14:37.189
We were dropping X in the back of
the truck, and I didn't see his face.

14:37.390 --> 14:39.397
The adults at the location?

14:40.622 --> 14:44.648
We were on the bright side of
the lights, and I couldn't see.

14:45.997 --> 14:48.037
The dead girl
you woke up with?

14:49.837 --> 14:51.658
Just one of the girls
partying.

14:52.907 --> 14:55.296
Look, Will,
you're in a lot of trouble...

14:55.372 --> 14:57.640
if you can't give us
anything else.

14:59.883 --> 15:02.566
I mean, I remember a voice.

15:03.467 --> 15:07.241
A girl saying,
"Do her. Do him."

15:07.722 --> 15:09.381
He's not much help.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.799
He can't even make an ID.
We've got nothing.

15:13.002 --> 15:16.263
What about the new date-rape drug
law? We could charge the creeps...

15:16.330 --> 15:18.631
who doped him with
facilitating a sex offense.

15:18.729 --> 15:21.510
If we could find whoever gave
him the drugs or shot the film.

15:21.577 --> 15:24.423
Right now I need a perp.
We need Jill Foster.

15:24.968 --> 15:28.067
I'd prefer a witness who
isn't a drugged-out street kid.

15:28.903 --> 15:31.751
How about we call in
Jill Foster's brother?

15:32.327 --> 15:34.815
Did your sister use drugs?

15:35.847 --> 15:38.815
She'd drop X just to
get through dinner tweaked.

15:39.783 --> 15:41.026
I should have
said something.

15:41.094 --> 15:43.777
Does your sister have
any special interests?

15:44.517 --> 15:45.728
Maybe art.

15:46.245 --> 15:47.905
She was failing
everything but art.

15:47.973 --> 15:50.493
She ever talk to you
about running away?

15:50.693 --> 15:53.954
Yeah, I thought it would have
been Disney World.

15:54.309 --> 15:56.315
She said she wanted
to see Dumbo.

15:58.852 --> 16:00.706
Okay, where are we?

16:00.964 --> 16:02.424
We look for Jill
in D.U.M.B.O.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.928
Why the art district?

16:04.004 --> 16:06.938
She told her brother. He doesn't know
that D.U.M.B.O.'s an acronym for...

16:07.012 --> 16:08.670
Down Under
the Manhattan Bridge Overpass.

16:08.738 --> 16:09.884
He's thinking the cartoon.

16:09.955 --> 16:11.711
Yeah, and what about
our Jane Doe?

16:11.778 --> 16:13.306
An overdose.

16:13.379 --> 16:15.866
Jane Doe has a name,
Gina Lang from D.C.

16:15.938 --> 16:18.042
Yeah? Have you notified
her parents? Yeah.

16:18.306 --> 16:21.340
They're very concerned by
the cost of shipping the body.

16:21.410 --> 16:23.264
Have we tied Kanick
to any of this?

16:23.330 --> 16:24.312
We can't find him.

16:24.386 --> 16:26.774
Why not?
No residence. No license.

16:26.848 --> 16:30.012
Third parties pick up mail. He banks
offshore. He's invisible and mobile.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.277
Green Excursion, registration
unknown. Circumstance ties him...

16:33.376 --> 16:36.224
to Rainlight Productions.
It's a licensed corporation...

16:36.287 --> 16:38.938
promoting
non-alcoholic events, raves.

16:39.007 --> 16:42.355
The attorney of record
is a Ted Bolger.

16:43.199 --> 16:45.500
Bolger cut Kanick's plea
on the hooker murder.

16:45.566 --> 16:47.868
Thirteen years ago, nice
to see they stay in touch.

16:47.935 --> 16:50.487
But the scum specializes
in prostitutes and pimps.

16:50.559 --> 16:52.565
Now he's filing
corporate papers?

16:52.638 --> 16:56.914
Benson, Stabler, to D.U.M.B.O.
Munch, Tutuola, take Bolger.

17:04.060 --> 17:06.262
Who the hell are you?

17:06.332 --> 17:07.444
Shut up and sit down.

17:07.515 --> 17:09.141
Get out of my office.

17:09.212 --> 17:11.633
I ain't going anywhere.
I'll call the police.

17:11.707 --> 17:14.390
For what? So you can show
them all your cocaine?

17:20.251 --> 17:22.160
What's your rate, man?

17:25.914 --> 17:27.157
Who are you?

17:27.226 --> 17:28.819
What's your rate?
I need the privilege.

17:28.890 --> 17:30.962
It's six bills an hour.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.601
I got some business.

17:40.377 --> 17:42.547
Fin?
Yeah, Fin.

17:45.975 --> 17:47.634
Okay, Fin.

17:49.912 --> 17:51.372
You just bought yourself
an hour.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.939
So you're my lawyer?

17:53.014 --> 17:54.737
For the next 59 minutes.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.911
So everything I say
has the privilege?

17:57.013 --> 17:59.086
I take it to my grave.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.222
Lance Kanick, where is he?

18:02.294 --> 18:03.723
I haven't seen him.

18:03.797 --> 18:06.448
He promotes Rainlight Raves.
You're Rainlight's lawyer.

18:06.517 --> 18:07.564
Who is he?

18:07.637 --> 18:09.872
That's my Jew. Where's Kanick?

18:09.972 --> 18:12.590
I got some young ladies
who wanna work for him.

18:13.779 --> 18:15.056
Okay, Fin.

18:27.538 --> 18:30.407
Okay, that is his cell phone.

18:30.674 --> 18:35.409
His line of work, it's better I don't
know where he is, you understand?

18:36.753 --> 18:38.477
And you didn't get that
from me.

18:39.985 --> 18:42.374
I understand you owe me
55 more minutes.

18:45.551 --> 18:46.696
Shalom.

18:49.136 --> 18:53.870
Last four digits, 5060. Your
Jew? What if I called you my boy?

18:54.190 --> 18:55.532
I'll be your boy, John.

18:55.599 --> 18:57.933
This is not funny. We're
not in Narcotics, you cowboy.

18:57.999 --> 18:59.558
Fast and loose
doesn't play here.

18:59.662 --> 19:01.353
Look, we got his cell
phone number, we got him.

19:01.422 --> 19:04.105
And I got a small ventricular rupture
pulled out of me with no warning.

19:04.174 --> 19:05.189
What's the matter with you?

19:08.461 --> 19:10.501
I love that t-shirt.

19:10.573 --> 19:12.842
I wanted to trade her,
but she wouldn't give it up.

19:12.909 --> 19:14.118
When was that?

19:14.189 --> 19:16.938
Two hours ago
with those candy kids.

19:17.004 --> 19:18.084
"Candy kids?"

19:18.892 --> 19:20.517
Fuzzy clothes,
plastic jewelry.

19:20.684 --> 19:24.742
They went to Lorna Frankel's loft. All the
kids hang there. It's at Johns and Gold.

19:25.035 --> 19:27.817
Look for the big pig.
Who's Lorna Frankel?

19:28.075 --> 19:32.385
Think Salvador Dali's feminine
side, and then give it fangs.

19:32.458 --> 19:33.407
Right.

19:44.744 --> 19:46.501
What's up, man?

19:54.344 --> 19:56.864
When I asked the agency for
men that defined the city...

19:56.936 --> 19:59.041
did they think
I was referring to Orlando?

19:59.303 --> 20:00.929
Are you Lorna Frankel?

20:00.998 --> 20:02.078
So far.

20:02.822 --> 20:07.394
So take your clothes off, and
arrange yourself on this sofa...

20:08.006 --> 20:09.861
and I'll make
something of it.

20:09.925 --> 20:11.486
Who are these kids?

20:13.509 --> 20:16.541
Don't know.
They wander in.

20:16.740 --> 20:18.529
She wander in,
Jill Foster?

20:20.100 --> 20:22.010
Well, if she did,
she'd be here.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.355
You see her?

20:23.428 --> 20:24.922
He's not stealing
is he?

20:26.148 --> 20:27.489
She left an hour ago.

20:27.555 --> 20:29.016
What's the quickest way
to find her?

20:29.091 --> 20:31.033
Do I look like
Missing Persons?

20:31.139 --> 20:35.099
Maybe I should check. Hey,
get up! Party's over. Get up.

20:35.684 --> 20:37.984
All right, I'm the police.
Show me some ID.

20:38.082 --> 20:40.831
They haven't done anything.
This is a free country.

20:40.898 --> 20:44.988
No, it's a democracy, and the majority
of us do not like what's going on here.

20:45.122 --> 20:48.155
Come on, empty your pockets. Put
it down here. You know the routine.

20:48.224 --> 20:51.324
Do what they say, but don't
tell them anything.

20:53.824 --> 20:55.351
License, registration?

20:55.648 --> 20:58.517
Truck's leased to Rainlight
Promotions. Driver's clean.

20:59.329 --> 21:00.789
Lance Kanick...

21:01.601 --> 21:04.382
step out of the car. We
tracked you by your cell phone.

21:08.031 --> 21:09.885
Where do you live?

21:12.670 --> 21:15.190
If you can't tell us, we can
provide you with an address.

21:15.261 --> 21:16.636
I'm at the Biltmore.

21:17.373 --> 21:21.170
Jill Foster's been seen in your
company. She's a minor. Where is she?

21:21.502 --> 21:22.876
She the Mayor's daughter?

21:23.580 --> 21:25.490
She's the child
of a police officer.

21:29.468 --> 21:32.784
There are 39,000 of us.
Anything happens to Jill...

21:32.861 --> 21:34.998
we're all gonna be looking
for a piece of you.

21:38.395 --> 21:40.434
You run into Jill,
you'll call us.

21:40.987 --> 21:42.448
I hear you.

21:47.033 --> 21:48.626
Hello, Mr. Police.

21:49.913 --> 21:51.342
Come on, in here.

21:52.473 --> 21:54.481
Hey, guys.
Ask my partner.

21:55.578 --> 21:56.722
Monique,
would you...

21:56.793 --> 21:58.134
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.793
You two, come on, let's go.

21:59.863 --> 22:01.839
Keep it down.
Just walk straight ahead.

22:01.944 --> 22:04.213
This is not a club. Come on.

22:04.536 --> 22:06.608
You couldn't question them
where you found them?

22:06.679 --> 22:08.566
They were taking cues
from Lorna Frankel.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.549
Well, who's that?

22:10.614 --> 22:12.654
D.U.M.B.O. artist.
They were in her loft.

22:12.727 --> 22:14.832
And kids like these,
fear motivates.

22:15.031 --> 22:16.973
Fin's good at that, fear.

22:17.047 --> 22:19.316
So what do you think you'll
scare out of these kids?

22:19.382 --> 22:22.830
Where Jill is. On the way over here
we got a rave she should be at tonight.

22:22.902 --> 22:26.065
You blew it. Now word will get out on
the street that we're looking for Jill.

22:26.133 --> 22:28.304
Heads up, Bolger.

22:31.605 --> 22:34.386
Fin role-played Bolger to
buy him as a Miami gangster.

22:34.549 --> 22:36.621
Undercover without clearance?

22:38.164 --> 22:42.385
Nobody said anything? It doesn't
matter, cause it's not admissible.

22:42.642 --> 22:43.854
That's right.

22:43.923 --> 22:46.127
I'm Ted Bolger.
I'll be your attorney. Okay?

22:47.827 --> 22:51.023
Juveniles with a $500-an-hour
mouthpiece. There goes your...

22:51.090 --> 22:53.479
motivational fear.
How did he get here so fast?

22:53.554 --> 22:56.903
Frankel's connected to Kanick.
Monique, Tito.

22:58.066 --> 23:01.480
Frankel and Kanick share a lawyer. If
Kanick finds out you're helping us...

23:01.553 --> 23:02.600
He'll kill me.

23:02.832 --> 23:05.003
You have a place to lay low? Yeah.

23:05.169 --> 23:08.649
All right, we need some background
information on a D.U.M.B.O. artist name of...

23:08.752 --> 23:09.996
Lorna Frankel.
Right.

23:10.064 --> 23:13.479
Now, these kids have to be
released now. Wait here.

23:20.911 --> 23:25.383
You enter uninvited a private home and
without cause, intimidate my clients.

23:25.454 --> 23:27.309
And then you haul them
in here for questioning.

23:27.374 --> 23:29.195
That's it. That's exactly
what happened.

23:29.262 --> 23:30.756
We're trying to find
a missing minor.

23:30.829 --> 23:32.739
I don't care if you're
looking for Osama bin Laden.

23:32.814 --> 23:34.635
This is still America,
right, kids?

23:35.757 --> 23:37.665
Come on,
let's get out of here.

23:37.772 --> 23:39.594
Come on. That's my lawyer right there.

23:43.148 --> 23:44.391
John.

23:51.019 --> 23:53.058
John, what the hell
were you thinking?

23:53.227 --> 23:55.014
A good cop's in prison,
his daughter was...

23:55.083 --> 23:57.799
mixed up with scum, and you
and Fin are out of control.

23:57.867 --> 23:59.808
If this compromises
my investigation...

23:59.883 --> 24:01.922
I'm holding both of you
personally responsible.

24:10.408 --> 24:13.190
Who authorized
the undercover operation?

24:13.448 --> 24:15.335
At the rave?
Yes.

24:16.040 --> 24:18.724
I don't know who authorized
it. I was just told to do it.

24:19.015 --> 24:21.917
By whom?
By my captain.

24:22.887 --> 24:26.083
But he would have never approved the
operation without going through...

24:26.151 --> 24:27.428
the proper channels.

24:27.558 --> 24:30.907
Det. Benson, are you trying
to cover for him?

24:31.174 --> 24:33.596
Are you trying to
jam up my boss?

24:33.831 --> 24:37.954
We're simply attempting to ascertain
who authorized the undercover operation.

24:38.022 --> 24:41.152
You'll have to ask the Captain. He
did not share that information with me.

24:41.221 --> 24:44.155
And what about a tactical plan?
Did he share that with you?

24:44.229 --> 24:45.156
Yes.

24:45.220 --> 24:47.041
Were all contingencies
covered?

24:47.109 --> 24:50.937
They were covered. We had backup.
We were in constant communication.

24:51.012 --> 24:52.768
You didn't cover
all your bases, did you?

24:52.868 --> 24:55.257
If you're implying that we
screwed up, you're off base.

24:55.363 --> 24:58.145
We're suggesting that
your plan was flawed.

25:01.602 --> 25:04.450
Some things
you can't foresee.

25:21.248 --> 25:23.353
Do you wanna try
some of these?

25:23.968 --> 25:26.837
Fin was right. This place is
an open market for drugs.

25:33.023 --> 25:35.989
Did you tell Tito to lay low?
Yeah, well, he's here.

25:39.517 --> 25:41.044
Security's got
an eye on him.

25:41.181 --> 25:43.221
Check him out.
Yeah.

25:48.733 --> 25:52.594
Tito, lay low
mean anything to you?

25:54.012 --> 25:55.922
I take care of myself.

26:12.218 --> 26:13.330
Jill!

26:13.402 --> 26:15.541
Cops! Everybody out!

26:16.762 --> 26:19.892
Take your hands off me. Let me
go. Someone help me! Let go of me!

26:21.465 --> 26:24.214
I need backup, back room on
the right. Follow the strobe.

26:24.313 --> 26:27.094
Police, break it up.
Get your hands off her guys.

26:32.248 --> 26:33.196
Jill!

26:36.631 --> 26:39.794
Get your hands off her.
Get against the wall now.

26:40.055 --> 26:41.002
Okay.

26:48.629 --> 26:51.346
I'm Alex Cabot,
D.A.'s office.

26:52.820 --> 26:56.563
I want my phone call.
It's been 12 hours.

26:57.781 --> 26:58.958
Right.

27:00.372 --> 27:02.826
You're lawyer's Ted Bolger?
Yeah.

27:03.284 --> 27:06.862
From your loft, images
of minors engaged in sex.

27:07.027 --> 27:09.001
And a wax strip
with Gina Lang's DNA.

27:09.075 --> 27:13.516
A 14-year-old who died after
engaging in sex at your direction...

27:13.746 --> 27:14.728
on this tape.

27:14.803 --> 27:18.249
Your rap sheet. In '79 you were
porn princess Layla Cream Cheese?

27:18.578 --> 27:22.538
Between '83 and '87 you were
arrested as call girl, Louise Francis.

27:22.993 --> 27:26.986
Because of prior bad acts, I'm seeking
for each count of minors performing sex...

27:27.153 --> 27:29.421
consecutive sentences
of seven years.

27:29.681 --> 27:32.298
For the death of Gina Lang,
the man two, max of 15.

27:32.528 --> 27:34.632
Seven hundred
and fifteen years.

27:34.704 --> 27:35.948
You need to
call a lawyer.

27:36.015 --> 27:38.121
A Rainlight Productions
check made out to you...

27:38.191 --> 27:39.565
signed by Lance Kanick.

27:39.632 --> 27:42.479
Bolger is Kanick's lawyer.
Bolger is Rainlight's lawyer.

27:42.543 --> 27:45.030
Bolger was the lawyer for
Ooo-Wee Escorts and Kanick...

27:45.103 --> 27:46.183
when he murdered...

27:46.255 --> 27:48.589
one of Ooo-Wee's call girls.
You remember?

27:48.718 --> 27:50.987
Yeah, Wendy.

27:52.078 --> 27:56.834
Both Bolger and Kanick benefit from illegal
enterprises, to which we can only tie you.

27:58.733 --> 28:00.969
You need to call a lawyer.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.803
There's something
you'll do for me?

28:06.444 --> 28:09.345
I think Bolger's more than a
lawyer. I think he's a partner.

28:09.452 --> 28:10.826
You make that
connection stick...

28:10.892 --> 28:13.030
you'll be out of jail
before menopause.

28:16.876 --> 28:20.420
Bolger's just a lawyer I was
supposed to call when this happens.

28:21.227 --> 28:24.324
So if you got all of the tapes
out of my loft, you've got Kanick.

28:25.163 --> 28:27.365
A couple of times when he was
coaching a few of the kids...

28:27.434 --> 28:28.928
I turned the camera around.

28:29.737 --> 28:34.493
It's dark, but it's there. He's
feeding them drugs and other things.

28:42.759 --> 28:43.774
You page Tito?

28:43.848 --> 28:46.050
Yeah, three times.
He finally calling in?

28:46.120 --> 28:47.908
Homicide is.

28:51.238 --> 28:52.186
Excuse me.

28:54.886 --> 28:56.227
Ed.
Elliot.

28:56.294 --> 28:59.643
Beeper went off, recognized the
number. Why were you paging him?

28:59.718 --> 29:02.019
You mind?
Go ahead.

29:02.885 --> 29:04.544
Looking for a runaway...

29:07.845 --> 29:09.470
he was helping us out.

29:28.385 --> 29:32.608
My dad's in jail?
This is my fault.

29:33.281 --> 29:34.808
You can fix it.
No, I can't.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.561
Yes, you can.
No, I can't.

29:38.528 --> 29:41.310
What I did tonight...
What?

29:42.465 --> 29:46.458
That rave you pulled me
out of, I had to roll...

29:46.753 --> 29:50.101
and I didn't have the money...
You rolling now?

29:51.070 --> 29:52.019
A little.

29:53.695 --> 29:57.043
All I had to do was take
pictures. Now my dad will see them.

29:58.078 --> 29:59.289
No, the cops have them.

29:59.359 --> 30:02.490
My dad's a cop.
They'll show him.

30:03.741 --> 30:07.800
They're my friends. Your dad
will never see them, I promise.

30:08.893 --> 30:10.748
Your family's dying
to see you.

30:11.261 --> 30:12.668
I can't.

30:13.596 --> 30:14.610
I can't.

30:15.293 --> 30:16.602
Where you gonna stay?

30:16.667 --> 30:17.845
I got a place.

30:19.164 --> 30:20.625
It's creepy,
but it gets me a roof.

30:32.219 --> 30:36.016
Bring the cops down on my rave.
You brought this on yourself.

30:40.345 --> 30:41.775
Tito?

30:43.065 --> 30:44.013
Tito?

30:46.423 --> 30:48.049
Cold yet?

31:06.902 --> 31:08.079
I'm willing to speak to you.

31:08.150 --> 31:11.216
However, you have no legal authority
to compel me to answer any questions.

31:11.285 --> 31:15.027
We are well aware of that, Ms. Cabot.
We're only trying to get to the truth.

31:15.669 --> 31:17.076
Aren't we all.

31:17.269 --> 31:19.986
After Tito Frank was murdered
by Lance Kanick...

31:20.052 --> 31:22.060
how would you describe
morale on the unit.

31:22.228 --> 31:25.577
Everyone was understandably upset
and eager to apprehend Mr. Kanick.

31:25.939 --> 31:29.168
What would you say was Capt.
Cragen's state of mind at that point?

31:30.067 --> 31:33.679
I would never speculate about another
person's state of mind. Ask him yourself.

31:33.779 --> 31:35.535
Do you agree
that Capt. Cragen's

31:35.602 --> 31:37.708
personal friendship
with Jill Foster's father...

31:37.938 --> 31:41.287
caused him to place undue pressure
on you to cut a deal with Kanick?

31:41.554 --> 31:44.368
Capt. Cragen
made his opinions clear.

31:45.522 --> 31:48.391
But if you're positing I cannot act
independently, then you're wrong.

31:48.465 --> 31:50.407
Would you agree,
nevertheless...

31:50.482 --> 31:52.456
that the investigation
was handled poorly?

31:53.233 --> 31:56.615
The Special Victims Unit acted in
a completely professional manner.

31:56.688 --> 31:58.412
An informant was
brutally murdered.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.349
Certainly you have
an opinion about that.

32:01.519 --> 32:04.519
If you are looking for someone to
denigrate Capt. Cragen or the unit...

32:04.624 --> 32:06.184
find someone else.

32:15.853 --> 32:18.505
That chair.
I want my lawyer.

32:20.045 --> 32:21.060
We do, too.

32:30.604 --> 32:33.418
It'll take eight years
to exhaust his appeals.

32:33.708 --> 32:37.056
He'll spend all of that time alone
in a cell half the size of this room.

32:37.260 --> 32:40.936
A call will be made to the Governor's
home an hour before the execution.

32:41.003 --> 32:45.738
Some bleeding heart with a desperate plea
for his life. I intend to answer that call.

32:50.153 --> 32:51.582
What can you do for me?

32:51.817 --> 32:54.021
I can't talk to you
since you requested a lawyer.

32:54.089 --> 32:55.811
Forget all of that.
Talk to me.

32:56.169 --> 32:57.478
You waiving
your Miranda rights?

32:57.544 --> 32:59.617
Hell, yes.
What can you do for me?

33:00.776 --> 33:02.718
Give me evidence that
Bolger is your partner...

33:02.792 --> 33:06.337
not just your lawyer, and I will
acquiesce to life without parole.

33:07.912 --> 33:11.261
Man one, fifteen. You get Bolger
and that girl you're looking for.

33:12.294 --> 33:13.472
No deal.

33:14.023 --> 33:15.811
No girl.

33:16.263 --> 33:17.888
Lethal injection.

33:17.957 --> 33:19.714
Heroin addiction.

33:22.311 --> 33:25.123
There is one offer
on the table, that's it.

33:27.045 --> 33:29.216
A cop's kid, too.

33:29.445 --> 33:31.933
I thought you all went the
extra mile for one of your own.

33:32.005 --> 33:34.208
It's my deal
or the death penalty.

33:34.853 --> 33:36.675
You've got 10 minutes.

33:41.186 --> 33:45.017
This is a cop's child.
What else matters?

33:45.539 --> 33:48.189
The D.A.'s office
has made worse deals.

33:48.450 --> 33:52.224
We see murderers out on the street in
less time for reasons with a lot less...

33:52.322 --> 33:55.486
validity every day. We have
to stomach that every day.

33:55.874 --> 33:58.591
It's not just the people
in this room, Alex.

33:59.009 --> 34:01.343
Everybody in blue knows
about the Foster case.

34:01.569 --> 34:02.943
This is in the family.

34:03.009 --> 34:04.667
Kanick will murder again.

34:04.801 --> 34:07.703
So you're murdering now. How's that
supposed to settle with the grunts?

34:07.776 --> 34:08.757
What are you saying?

34:08.831 --> 34:10.871
What he's saying is,
it's harder to do our jobs...

34:10.944 --> 34:12.634
if we've lost faith
in the D.A.'s office.

34:12.703 --> 34:15.551
Are you threatening me?
It's a blanket statement.

34:15.678 --> 34:18.612
Offer him 20 years. He'll be
60 by the time he gets out.

34:18.687 --> 34:20.596
I'm not putting that animal
back on the streets.

34:20.670 --> 34:23.224
He killed with a tire iron,
with a gun. No remorse.

34:23.293 --> 34:25.748
He gets out in 20 years, he'll
be killing with something else...

34:25.853 --> 34:27.741
murdering someone else.

34:27.804 --> 34:29.909
Alex, we can save
a life today.

34:29.981 --> 34:32.850
Not prevent some hypothetical
murder 20 years down the road.

34:32.925 --> 34:35.674
There's a girl out there
that needs our help now.

34:39.197 --> 34:40.755
He ain't giving it up.
I know.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.032
We can get it out of him.
We don't do that here.

34:43.196 --> 34:45.813
I heard the speech. And I'll
listen to it, but not today.

34:45.884 --> 34:47.824
Kanick won't deal,
so don't ask me to do that.

34:47.963 --> 34:49.905
Cabot's right.
Kanick shouldn't get out.

34:50.012 --> 34:53.808
So some little girl goes down the tubes?
Look, my way we can get both jobs done.

34:53.882 --> 34:55.824
I don't do that anymore.
I'm old and it's tiring.

34:55.898 --> 34:57.970
I'll do the heavy lifting.
It's not the heavy lifting.

34:58.043 --> 35:00.562
Everything you do comes back
at you, blows to the soul.

35:00.634 --> 35:03.155
It's the metaphysical heavy
lifting I can't do anymore.

35:03.225 --> 35:06.574
I can work this one alone.
I don't wanna know about it.

35:07.097 --> 35:08.406
Forest on Central.

35:10.681 --> 35:13.136
Fin. Keys. I'll drive.

35:14.584 --> 35:16.690
I got him.
Give him here.

35:31.958 --> 35:35.603
In the car on the way to Central Booking,
Mr. Kanick volunteered where we could...

35:35.669 --> 35:36.651
find Jill Foster.

35:36.726 --> 35:38.699
Volunteered after you
tuned him up...

35:38.773 --> 35:40.235
is what you mean,
isn't it, Detective?

35:40.309 --> 35:41.716
Other than hitting his head...

35:41.780 --> 35:44.813
on the roof of the car when we put him
in, no one laid a hand on Mr. Kanick.

35:44.884 --> 35:46.772
That's not the information
we have.

35:46.836 --> 35:48.363
Information from who, him?

35:48.436 --> 35:51.502
I got the Combat Cross. I got
a file full of commendations.

35:51.572 --> 35:54.637
That does not give you the right to
beat information out of a suspect.

35:54.708 --> 35:56.812
He's a liar. We have a
complaint of brutality.

35:56.883 --> 35:59.152
Who are you gonna believe,
me or that piece of garbage?

35:59.219 --> 36:00.713
You tell us
who should we believe.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.601
Kanick gave us what we needed.

36:19.536 --> 36:21.805
Yeah, tell Cabot
she can get her warrant.

36:24.175 --> 36:27.307
When I worked Narcotics
nobody counted.

36:27.407 --> 36:31.019
One drug dealer rips off another
drug dealer. There were no good guys.

36:31.598 --> 36:34.120
When I came over to SVU,
it was different.

36:34.414 --> 36:38.505
They got real victims, okay?
Innocents like Jill Foster.

36:39.374 --> 36:42.374
She didn't ask to do porno.
She was forced to.

36:54.509 --> 36:58.283
Jill, are you in here?

37:02.603 --> 37:05.286
Jill, we're detectives.
We wanna help you.

37:06.219 --> 37:08.390
Jill, it's okay.

37:12.106 --> 37:13.088
Elliot.

37:21.994 --> 37:26.216
This is Det. Benson from SVU unit.
We need to rush a bus to Avenue...

37:26.312 --> 37:28.995
D and 3rd Street.
Avenue D and 3rd Street.

37:29.065 --> 37:30.046
Olivia.

37:30.121 --> 37:32.291
We have a 16-year-old female...

37:33.735 --> 37:35.523
Forget it.
There's no pulse.

37:43.110 --> 37:46.241
And I do whatever I gotta do to
save a kid from a perv like Kanick.

37:46.309 --> 37:48.065
You kicked
the crap out of him.

37:48.133 --> 37:50.468
Jill Foster's dead
on account of Kanick.

37:54.053 --> 37:56.191
I want my union delegate.

38:04.004 --> 38:04.951
He's here.

38:11.491 --> 38:13.149
Want me to go with you?

38:13.954 --> 38:14.902
No.

38:44.191 --> 38:46.526
We didn't get the information
fast enough...

38:46.591 --> 38:48.695
from Kanick to prevent
Jill Foster's death.

38:49.758 --> 38:52.027
Capt. Cragen,
we have grave concerns...

38:52.094 --> 38:54.068
about the actions
of your detectives...

38:54.462 --> 38:57.495
that at least one of them used
excessive force with a suspect...

38:57.565 --> 38:59.321
and that a confidential
informant was...

38:59.389 --> 39:02.651
improperly used and actually
mishandled, leading to his death.

39:02.717 --> 39:05.586
All these allegations
still remain unsubstantiated.

39:05.660 --> 39:09.009
That's not gonna stop you from
making an example of someone, is it?

39:09.340 --> 39:13.049
I take full responsibility for the
actions of the detectives under my command.

39:13.115 --> 39:16.377
We believe your failure to
supervise warrants a five-day rip.

39:16.475 --> 39:18.810
You wanna dock me
five days of vacation, fine.

39:18.907 --> 39:20.729
You really think
that's gonna change anything?

39:20.827 --> 39:22.964
Not this time,
but hopefully the next.

39:24.634 --> 39:27.862
A girl OD'd and died alone.

39:28.601 --> 39:31.088
Her father, a decorated cop...

39:31.225 --> 39:34.095
30-year career over,
no pension.

39:34.392 --> 39:36.116
His family in shambles.

39:37.368 --> 39:40.565
But you know what really,
really scares me?

39:41.496 --> 39:44.081
That all you people are
concerned about is some lying...

39:44.471 --> 39:46.642
murdering sack of crap.

39:46.776 --> 39:50.549
In this country that lying, murdering
sack of crap has rights, too, Captain.

39:51.542 --> 39:54.891
Tito. Jill Foster.

39:55.831 --> 39:59.147
They're both dead.
What about their rights?
