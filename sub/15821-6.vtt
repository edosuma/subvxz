00:24.700 --> 00:26.500
I didn't think you'd come.

00:27.300 --> 00:27.900
I,

00:27.900 --> 00:28.900
had to.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.300
Push the button.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.500
Allow me.

01:16.900 --> 01:19.600
This is the general manager of the hotel.
Michael henson.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.400
I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.600
This is chief pope.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.100
Hello, mr. Pope.

01:24.100 --> 01:25.300
Nice to see you again, sir.

01:25.300 --> 01:26.800
Thank you, michael.You, too.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.900
Given our clientele and the late hour,

01:29.900 --> 01:33.100
I was hoping that your people could
be as discreet as possible.

01:33.100 --> 01:37.700
Our job is to be as thorough as possible
to determine if this is a homicide.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.300
I understood...

01:39.300 --> 01:41.900
I understood that this was a suicide.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.500
We don't know what happened yet.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.000
But right now,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.400
I need you to step out of this room,please, sir.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.900
This is a crime scene.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.900
Thank you, michael.

01:50.300 --> 01:51.500
Of course.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.300
So, sergeant gabriel,

01:54.300 --> 01:56.400
did our victim leave a note?

01:56.400 --> 01:56.900
No.

01:56.900 --> 02:00.200
No note.No sign of a struggle or
anyone else in the room.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.100
This guy's got no luggage,

02:01.100 --> 02:02.900
nothing in the closet,or the bathroom.

02:02.900 --> 02:04.000
Not even a toothbrush.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.500
All we found was this wallet,

02:05.500 --> 02:07.100
and this leather cigar case.

02:07.100 --> 02:08.300
Did he have a name?

02:08.300 --> 02:09.100
Anthony larsen.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.600
Age 39.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.900
And what do we know about mr. Larsen?

02:12.900 --> 02:14.700
Well, the address on the I.D.Is a real one.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.200
I ran a rap sheet search on him,

02:16.200 --> 02:17.800
he's been arrested a few times.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.200
Trespassing.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.300
Occupation,

02:20.300 --> 02:21.700
photographer.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.100
Trespassing photographer.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.500
An esteemed member of the paparazzi.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.900
So where is his camera?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.700
Maybe he realized what a pathetic
existence he lead

02:39.700 --> 02:44.200
taking pictures of stars without their
make-up on and jumped.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.100
You don't need  a camera for that.

02:46.100 --> 02:46.900
Could just be an accident.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.500
Got drunk and fell.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.800
Wouldn't be the first time.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.300
That's for sure.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.500
He looks a lot better from up here.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.900
Shame to ruin such a nice shirt.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.600
This guy's lucky.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.800
I had a jumper a couple years ago.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.100
Dived right off a freeway overpass onto the 101.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.200
He was...

03:05.200 --> 03:06.300
everywhere.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.500
Lieutenant tao,

03:07.500 --> 03:09.800
do not move that body!

03:10.200 --> 03:14.200
Tell lieutenant flynn we are looking for a camera.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.100
Ok, chief.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.300
Thank you.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.700
Please, does she have to yell?

03:18.700 --> 03:19.700
I'm sorry, michael.

03:19.700 --> 03:23.600
She sometimes forgets there are
other people in the world.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.500
So, mr. Larsen.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.800
Were you celebrating something or
drowning your sorrows?

03:33.700 --> 03:38.800
I'll need a list of all your hotel staff
and all security video.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.000
That's not possible.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
We have lots of security,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
but no security cameras.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.400
Our guests choose us because we value
their privacy as much as they do.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.500
I'll need to speak with all your
security personnel then.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.100
And what time did mr. Larsen check in?

03:54.100 --> 03:56.500
I'd have to check the computer.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.600
Right now?

03:59.600 --> 04:01.700
That would be very helpful, mr. Henson.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.500
Thank you so much.

04:04.000 --> 04:04.500
All right.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.900
Thank you, michael.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.300
Nick.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.100
This is nicholas costa our night manager.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.200
He can help you.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.500
Thank you.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.700
Can I speak with you for a moment?

04:22.900 --> 04:26.000
Would it be possible to get
a list of all the guests?

04:26.000 --> 04:26.900
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.900
We don't give our guest's
personal information out.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.600
May compromise the integrity of the hotel.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.200
How do you think my decorating this
lobby with yellow police tape

04:34.200 --> 04:37.900
and frisking all the guests would affect
the integrity of this hotel?

04:39.100 --> 04:40.000
This may take a moment.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.900
Thank you so much.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.800
why don't you put that over here.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.500
You sure?

04:55.500 --> 04:56.800
Oh, trust me.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.400
So, no suicide note at the house either.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.300
But we did find some cameras.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.500
There's no film in any of them,

05:04.500 --> 05:07.600
but we found a bunch of roles
of 35mm in his fridge.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.600
Along with a jar of capers,

05:09.600 --> 05:11.400
and a 5-pack of heineken.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.200
Sounds like the fridge of a man who's
either single or divorced.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.000
Divorced. 6 months ago.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.900
The ex-wife is on her way in.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.300
Apparently our paparazzi--

05:19.300 --> 05:20.900
paparazzo.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.100
What?

05:22.100 --> 05:26.900
The singular form of paparazzi is paparazzo.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.900
Ok.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.500
our guy was pretty good at his job.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.900
Just take a look at some of the photos he's got.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.900
Check this out.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.900
She should not wear that bathing suit.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.400
I remember that one.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.300
I knew this guy had hair plugs.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.500
Also found a threatening letter from a lawyer,

05:50.500 --> 05:53.600
a court summons,and restraining order.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.500
This is trash.

05:55.500 --> 05:59.300
this trash  is probably worth hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.400
Tabloids pay good money,

06:00.400 --> 06:02.900
but I looked into anthony's finances.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.200
Closet full of prada,

06:04.200 --> 06:05.900
lots of credit card debt,

06:05.900 --> 06:06.900
no savings.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.100
The american dream.

06:09.100 --> 06:12.900
So we know that anthony larsen invades
people's privacy,

06:12.900 --> 06:14.300
what about the hotel's guest list?

06:14.300 --> 06:16.600
Anybody who's privacy was worth invading?

06:16.600 --> 06:18.900
A lot of guests are registered under
assumed names.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.000
Probably celebs.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.300
They got norman bates,

06:21.300 --> 06:22.400
archie leach,

06:22.400 --> 06:23.500
lorraine mcfly.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.400
What about the hotel staff?

06:25.400 --> 06:28.600
it looks like the front desk only
issued one key card to humpty dumpty.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.900
A guy named manuel took up the champagne,

06:30.900 --> 06:33.300
said larsen seemed muy bien.

06:33.300 --> 06:38.100
Even tipped him on top of the 17 percent
gratuity they add to every charge--

06:38.100 --> 06:39.300
what is it with you?

06:39.300 --> 06:40.400
So, flynn,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.400
anything useful from the neighborhood canvass?

06:42.400 --> 06:44.000
No. But I checked with dispatch.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.900
There was a 415 man call last night.

06:46.900 --> 06:49.600
A guy loitering across the street from the hotel.

06:49.600 --> 06:53.300
I'm still waiting to talk to the patrolman
who answered the call.

06:53.300 --> 06:53.900
Ok,

06:53.900 --> 06:55.900
so, basically,we know...

06:56.700 --> 06:57.900
diddly.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.800
Do you think this was suicide?

07:06.800 --> 07:08.700
We have to look at everything.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.900
We can do this later if you'd like.

07:14.000 --> 07:14.900
No.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.800
No. Now is fine.

07:19.400 --> 07:24.000
Do you know if anthony had any run-ins
with any celebrities recently?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.500
He kept all that to himself.

07:26.500 --> 07:30.000
This actor broke his nose outside
a restaurant once.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.700
I got so upset he stopped talking about work.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.900
I mean, these stars.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.300
They're such hypocrites.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.900
They hate when he takes their pictures,

07:40.900 --> 07:44.700
but they can't exist without getting in magazines.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.500
Anthony was just trying to make a living.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.500
And when was the last time you spoke to him?

07:52.500 --> 07:54.500
About 4 months ago.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.200
We argued.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.500
He was behind making child support.

08:03.500 --> 08:07.800
This divorce, it's been hard on everyone.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.700
I'm sorry. You don't want to hear
about all this stuff.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.000
It's ok.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.600
I know how painful divorce can be.

08:15.600 --> 08:20.700
Anything that helps us understand anthony might
help us figure out what happened to him.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.600
He always talked about a million dollar shot.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.900
How that  million dollar picture would solve
all of our problems.

08:31.100 --> 08:31.900
It's ok.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.900
We don't have to talk about this anymore.

08:35.600 --> 08:39.900
I just need you to help me identify
what we found in the room.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.900
That's his wallet.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.200
And I remember that cigar case.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.500
We had a fight over it.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.500
It cost $300.

08:52.900 --> 08:53.900
Ok.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.200
Thank you.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.400
That's all he had?

09:00.400 --> 09:01.200
That can't be.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.300
Where's his girlfriend?

09:04.600 --> 09:05.100
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.500
His camera.

09:07.000 --> 09:07.900
I...

09:08.900 --> 09:10.200
I called it his girlfriend.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.500
He would've had that with him.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.400
No.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.600
It was a nikon.

09:16.600 --> 09:20.300
He carried it in an old leather bag
with his best lenses.

09:20.300 --> 09:21.900
He took it everywhere.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.400
I'm sorry.We haven't found it.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.300
Does it hold some sentimental value for you?

09:27.300 --> 09:28.500
no.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.900
But it's worth,like, $10,000.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.500
My kids could use that money.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.300
I'm sure they could.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.500
Detective daniels will put you in
touch with someone

09:38.500 --> 09:41.800
who understands these estate issues
better than we do.

09:41.800 --> 09:42.600
I'll be happy to.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.600
Thank you.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.600
Thank you, anna,

09:44.600 --> 09:45.900
for your time.

09:51.800 --> 09:56.900
These fractures,contusions and abrasions
are consistent with a big fall.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.500
Any chance he was killed first and
dumped over the side?

09:59.500 --> 10:00.800
Maybe drugged?

10:00.800 --> 10:03.000
No. No, the fall killed him.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.300
and I did find something unusual.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.700
Broken bones on his right hand.

10:07.700 --> 10:08.600
From the fall?

10:08.600 --> 10:09.300
No.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.000
If these bones were broken on impact,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.900
then we'd expect to find some scrapes
on the hand, but nothing.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.500
Could you flip him?

10:29.400 --> 10:29.900
Tag team?

10:36.400 --> 10:37.500
There we go.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.900
Thank you.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.100
Could that be from a broken rib?

10:59.100 --> 11:00.600
No.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.400
That's a bruise.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.000
That had to happen before he fell.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.600
Some kind of external trauma.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.800
Like smacking into a railing?

11:16.100 --> 11:17.400
No. Dogleg to the right,

11:17.400 --> 11:18.600
and you're in the rough.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.500
Too long.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.400
The x is where anthony larsen landed.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.400
We tried the drunken fall,

11:24.400 --> 11:26.400
and leaned over too far with the camera.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.700
Neither of which came close.

11:28.700 --> 11:29.600
Who's heather?

11:29.600 --> 11:30.700
Provenza's third wife.

11:30.700 --> 11:31.300
Fourth.

11:31.300 --> 11:32.500
Fourth?

11:32.800 --> 11:34.300
I can't keep count.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.600
Here comes jumped from the chair.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.100
You know, I'll never understand
why people commit suicide.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.000
It's just selfish.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.800
This is hollywood.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.500
Ah, liz.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.700
Liz used to always correct my grammar.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.500
that's gonna leave a mark.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.300
*********

11:55.800 --> 11:56.700
Hello?

11:56.700 --> 11:57.900
Lieutenant.

11:57.900 --> 12:01.300
Push the dummy's rib up against the railing.

12:01.300 --> 12:02.500
Flip him over,

12:02.500 --> 12:06.600
and then hang him over the side
like he's holding on--

12:08.900 --> 12:10.800
push the dummy's rib...

12:11.400 --> 12:12.900
the right hand?

12:13.100 --> 12:14.900
And then you want me to step on it?

12:16.000 --> 12:16.900
Ok. Got it.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.200
Lift.

12:21.200 --> 12:21.700
Hold it,

12:21.700 --> 12:23.000
hold it, hold it.

12:23.000 --> 12:23.900
Right here.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.300
Here we go.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.000
You got it?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.700
Sorry, sharon.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.600
See?

12:37.400 --> 12:38.500
Nice shot.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.900
Gravity's a bitch.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.900
Just a hunch.

12:43.900 --> 12:44.900
Good hunch.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.900
Sharon always had to be right.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.900
Please leave a message.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.600
Fritzy.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.800
Hey, you didn't tell me you had a new number.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.200
Anyway, if this is you,

13:09.200 --> 13:10.000
call me.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
703-555-0198.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.500
0198.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.500
703-555...

13:19.500 --> 13:22.900
703-555...

13:26.600 --> 13:27.800
what a night.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.500
10 hours.

13:29.700 --> 13:30.900
Sitting on a wire.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.700
Just to hear a guy order thai food.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.500
Who orders thai food at 2 o'clock in the morning?

13:37.500 --> 13:40.900
How long do I have to stand here half
naked before you notice?

13:42.900 --> 13:43.500
Hello.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.700
Hello .

13:47.100 --> 13:47.700
Hey.

13:47.700 --> 13:48.900
Hey .

13:55.800 --> 13:57.900
I can go in a little late if you want.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.700
you mind if i take a nap first?

14:07.600 --> 14:08.700
No.

14:17.300 --> 14:22.700
So, there's this paparazzi staying at
a snooty hotel he can't afford.

14:22.700 --> 14:28.500
The secretive hotel hates the paparazzi
as do the celebrity guests

14:28.500 --> 14:31.800
who stay there under assumed names.

14:31.800 --> 14:37.100
The paparazzi gets drunk and plummets 11
stories after someone smashes his hand.

14:37.100 --> 14:40.800
Now no one can find the $10,000 camera
that he always has with him.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.000
Seems like larsen got a photo somebody
didn't want him to get.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.300
He was chasing a million dollar picture.

14:46.300 --> 14:47.800
Who's worth that much money?

14:47.800 --> 14:50.400
Did we I.D.On those aliases yet?

14:50.400 --> 14:51.700
We got a couple.

14:51.700 --> 14:55.400
Norman bates is actually krusha,
a rap star in from new york.

14:55.400 --> 14:59.700
Lorraine mcfly and some supermodel
I've never heard of, velena.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.400
Still working on the others.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.400
Did larsen have a clear line of sight
into any of those rooms?

15:04.400 --> 15:05.700
Velena...

15:06.400 --> 15:08.100
was in room 1132.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.000
On the other side of the hotel.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.100
But he might have had a good
view into krusha's crib.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.200
1012.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.000
Rappers travel with some pretty serious security.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.300
If they knew larsen got a photo...

15:18.300 --> 15:24.700
also, larsen had a pretty good view
on the room above, 1112.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.700
I took these from anthony's balcony.

15:28.100 --> 15:28.900
Oh, ok.

15:28.900 --> 15:30.600
Any luck with larsen's nikon?

15:30.600 --> 15:32.800
Anna larsen had the original receipt in her files,

15:32.800 --> 15:34.500
and it had the serial number on it.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.000
We forwarded that info to the pawn detail.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.100
They're canvassing all the shops in L.A. County.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.100
That particular nikon camera's pretty popular.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.100
Thank you, thank you.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.000
Thank you, lieutenant tao.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.200
Ok.

15:45.200 --> 15:49.200
I think I might know who another
one of our mystery celebs is.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.200
That was the officer who issued
the loitering ticket.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.900
The guy he cited...

15:53.900 --> 15:56.700
his name was elvis presley.

15:58.200 --> 15:58.900
I swear to god,

15:58.900 --> 16:00.400
that's his real name.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.500
When the officer asked him what
he was doing there,

16:03.500 --> 16:06.600
he said he was waiting for whit coleman.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.900
Whit coleman,whit coleman?

16:07.900 --> 16:08.800
The movie star?

16:08.800 --> 16:12.700
A photo of him would be worth
a lot more than krusha.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.500
What time did the officer speak with elvis?

16:14.500 --> 16:15.500
Between 9 and 10,

16:15.500 --> 16:17.400
he wrote him a ticket then sent him on his way,

16:17.400 --> 16:18.700
and chief, get this,

16:18.700 --> 16:23.300
elvis has racked up 72 parking tickets
in front of whit coleman's house.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.000
Ok.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.300
I need the exact time that the officer
told elvis to leave.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.700
Lieutenant tao, please keep looking
for that camera.

16:29.700 --> 16:31.300
And lieutenant provenza,

16:31.300 --> 16:35.500
if we could put whit coleman at the cielo,

16:35.500 --> 16:36.600
it would be wonderful.

16:36.600 --> 16:37.400
Thank you.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.300
Sergeant gabriel,

16:38.300 --> 16:39.100
lieutenant flynn,

16:39.100 --> 16:40.200
detective daniels,

16:40.200 --> 16:42.000
would y'all come with me please?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.500
Where are we going?

16:44.800 --> 16:45.900
Graceland.

17:02.700 --> 17:03.200
Hey, chief.

17:03.200 --> 17:03.900
Come here.

17:06.099 --> 17:07.300
He's there every day.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.300
I call it in,

17:08.300 --> 17:09.300
cops show up,

17:09.300 --> 17:10.200
he moves.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.000
10 minutes later,

17:11.000 --> 17:12.200
he's back.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.300
But as long as he stays 250 feet away,

17:14.300 --> 17:16.900
he's not violating his restraining order.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.700
Are those all pictures in there?

17:22.099 --> 17:22.900
I got it.

17:23.900 --> 17:26.800
Did you see him the other night
at the cielo hotel?

17:26.800 --> 17:28.800
He was cited near there.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.800
Any chance he was following your boss?

17:30.800 --> 17:32.500
Whit coleman?

17:32.500 --> 17:33.400
Ok.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.900
Thanks for stopping by.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.800
If you can get that freak to leave,

17:36.800 --> 17:38.700
we would appreciate that.

17:39.000 --> 17:39.900
Close that gate.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.100
you scared the daylights out of us.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.900
Look, I'm outside the 250 foot zone.

17:50.900 --> 17:51.400
Ok.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.200
I'm ok.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.300
Ok, ok.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.900
We just want to ask you about whit coleman.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.100
Whit's a great guy not just a great actor.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.100
I've known him a long time.

18:01.100 --> 18:02.500
He's my friend.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.900
Friends don't usually take out restraining
orders on each other.

18:04.900 --> 18:05.900
That's not whit.

18:05.900 --> 18:07.800
His people just don't like me.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.900
That's what happens when lawyers get involved.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.800
Are those pictures of whit coleman?

18:14.100 --> 18:15.700
I'm doing a coffee table book on whit.

18:15.700 --> 18:16.200
The other side.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.000
The side you don't see.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.800
The human side.

18:18.800 --> 18:19.300
Really.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.500
I'm looking after whit.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.700
That's what friends do for each other.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.000
He needs real people  around him.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.400
Not all these phonies.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.500
Like the other night?

18:26.500 --> 18:28.700
You were cited for loitering near the cielo hotel.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.000
Were you looking out for whit then?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.200
I was trying.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.900
But you people sent me away.

18:32.900 --> 18:35.000
So whit was staying at the cielo last night?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.100
Yeah. He stays there a lot.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.500
Under assumed names,of course.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.500
Do you know any of whit's aliases?

18:39.500 --> 18:41.900
Yeah. I know all of them.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.600
Archie leach is his favorite.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.800
That's cary grant's real name.

18:46.800 --> 18:51.500
Were any of the rooms that tao took a picture
of registered to archie leach?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.500
1121.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.000
Before you were forced to leave the cielo,

18:59.000 --> 19:00.700
did you see this man?

19:01.300 --> 19:02.900
No. But I know him.

19:03.400 --> 19:04.800
He's a parasite.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.200
They're all parasites.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.200
Sticking the camera into whit's face.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.100
Trying to provoke a reaction.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.300
These are sad,

19:11.300 --> 19:12.900
desperate people.

19:12.900 --> 19:15.200
And that's why I need to look out for whit.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.600
They killed princess diana.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.500
And they got away with it, too.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.400
this guy didn't get away with anything.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.500
He's dead.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.500
Good.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.900
He was probably sticking his lens
where it doesn't belong.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.500
A story just came out on the A.P.

19:31.500 --> 19:35.000
Saying the death at the cielo has been
officially ruled a homicide.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.800
We haven't officially ruled it anything.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.400
Have you narrowed down the cause of death?

19:39.400 --> 19:40.700
Falling.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.600
Anything more specific?

19:42.600 --> 19:44.700
Our dummies suggest homicide.

19:44.700 --> 19:45.400
Your dummies?

19:45.400 --> 19:48.200
What I really need is to talk to whit coleman.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.500
The whit coleman?

19:49.500 --> 19:50.700
What does he have to do with this?

19:50.700 --> 19:53.600
I have a witness who saw him last
night at the hotel.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.900
Our dead...

19:54.900 --> 19:58.000
paparazzo may have taken some compromising photos.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Why do we think this?

19:59.000 --> 19:59.900
Because there was no camera.

20:02.500 --> 20:03.300
Who's your witness?

20:03.300 --> 20:04.200
Elvis presley.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.900
He's also a suspect.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.800
Let's just tell the press no comment.

20:09.800 --> 20:10.900
Right.

20:16.400 --> 20:20.600
The room across from larsen's balcony
was registered to archie leach.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.500
That's one of whit's common aliases.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.400
I need to talk to him, will.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.400
If the good lord himself descended to earth

20:26.400 --> 20:28.200
and demanded that whit coleman speak to you,

20:28.200 --> 20:29.800
you'd still get tom blanchard.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.000
Who's tom blanchard?

20:31.000 --> 20:31.900
His lawyer.

20:46.700 --> 20:47.900
This is brenda.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.400
Hi, this is brenda.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.600
I'm,...

20:50.600 --> 20:51.900
just calling.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.700
Hi, this is...

20:55.700 --> 20:56.700
hi. It's brenda.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.200
I got--we got your call today.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.100
Hey, it's me.

20:59.100 --> 20:59.800
Leave a message.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.800
9:45.

21:04.800 --> 21:05.300
What?

21:05.300 --> 21:09.500
9:45 is when the officer's log says
elvis left the building.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.400
So he couldn't have tossed the paparazzo.

21:11.400 --> 21:15.900
But whit coleman's bodyguard says that elvis
always comes back after he's sent away.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.800
And anthony didn't fall until 10:05.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.300
Chief, we got a hit on that camera.

21:19.300 --> 21:20.600
What? You're kidding.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.600
That pawn detail actually came through?

21:22.600 --> 21:25.500
The camera's at santa monica jewelry
and loan at 5th and wilshire.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.300
Get over there quick.

21:26.300 --> 21:29.900
I want that camera in my hands before
I talk to whit coleman's lawyer.

21:29.900 --> 21:32.900
I don't think that's going to happen.

21:39.500 --> 21:43.000
Get me a camera and bring it to
my office in 10 minutes.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.800
I don't think I can get the camera  that fast.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.500
It doesn't have to be the camera.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.600
Just a camera.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.900
Thank you so much,lieutenant.

21:52.360 --> 21:55.150
Whit's a big fan of the lapd.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.460
He played a detective a couple of years ago.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.950
He worked really closely with the department.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.420
To get the character right.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.580
I'm so glad we could be of service.

22:03.610 --> 22:07.590
So I know he'd be really bummed if we were forced to bring a harassment suit against you.

22:07.610 --> 22:12.620
Asking someone for help in an investigation hardly rises to the level of harassment,mr. Blanchard.

22:12.650 --> 22:14.970
Miss johnson,whit's a public figure.

22:15.010 --> 22:23.020
Bad P.R. Has financial and emotional implications that people like you can't even fathom.

22:24.660 --> 22:29.490
Could you please tell me about your client's whereabouts and actions last night?

22:30.560 --> 22:32.840
You know,it looks like you have a really good thing here.

22:32.870 --> 22:35.970
Big office,lots of guys working for you.

22:35.990 --> 22:41.990
I'd really hate to see you screw that up by being the latest in a long line of women fixated on whit coleman.

22:42.020 --> 22:46.390
If you want an autograph,there are easier ways.

22:51.550 --> 22:54.000
I don't care about autographs.

22:54.010 --> 22:57.570
But I do care about your client,as do you which is why you're here.

22:57.630 --> 22:59.490
To find out what I know.

22:59.550 --> 23:00.250
Now...

23:00.290 --> 23:03.270
while I'd love to do lunch and talk it over,

23:03.290 --> 23:05.320
I think I'll just tell you.

23:05.510 --> 23:10.280
We know that your client was at the hotel cielo last night.

23:10.300 --> 23:13.140
We know that a photo was taken of him by a paparazzi,

23:13.160 --> 23:15.540
and we know that paparazzi is dead.

23:15.560 --> 23:19.590
What I'd like you to tell me is why was he there?

23:19.630 --> 23:21.090
Who was he meeting?

23:21.120 --> 23:23.030
What was he doing?

23:24.100 --> 23:28.230
If you had that paparazzo's photo,

23:28.270 --> 23:31.360
you wouldn't be asking me these questions.

23:33.610 --> 23:36.010
Pardon me one moment.

23:46.950 --> 23:49.560
You were right,if I had the victim's camera,

23:49.590 --> 23:52.230
I wouldn't need to ask you all these questions.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.740
So thank you so much for your time.

23:53.770 --> 23:57.090
I'm just gonna have this film developed,and we'll be in touch.

23:57.860 --> 23:59.910
Thank you so much.

24:02.380 --> 24:04.240
Lucky you.

24:13.780 --> 24:15.410
Lucky me.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.290
Stupid,stupid,stupid.

24:23.330 --> 24:26.730
Dumb. Stupid,stupid.

24:27.390 --> 24:28.610
Chief!

24:28.660 --> 24:30.460
Just a second.

24:32.070 --> 24:32.630
Chief!

24:32.670 --> 24:34.020
What is it with you people?

24:34.050 --> 24:36.190
I'm in the ladies room.

24:36.630 --> 24:38.920
Excuse me,I am terribly sorry.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.960
But this is anthony larsen's nikon camera,

24:40.990 --> 24:42.970
and the serial number matches.

24:43.020 --> 24:45.320
Oh,tell me the film's still in it?

24:45.340 --> 24:47.090
No film. It's digital.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.370
Tell me the digital thing is still in there.

24:49.390 --> 24:51.070
The memory card is gone.

24:51.100 --> 24:55.350
But I do have the pawn slip with the name,address,

24:55.370 --> 24:57.210
and signature of the guy who pawned it.

24:57.250 --> 24:58.930
Nicholas costa.

24:58.980 --> 25:01.040
The night manager of the hotel.

25:01.080 --> 25:02.560
Oh,thank you.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.430
Lieutenant?

25:10.800 --> 25:13.090
How dare you accuse me.

25:14.410 --> 25:15.750
I've done nothing wrong.

25:15.770 --> 25:18.960
Well,you can see why I'm having such a hard time believing you.

25:18.980 --> 25:23.820
That is a pawn slip for anthony larsen's camera with your name on it.

25:27.050 --> 25:28.310
Ok.

25:28.620 --> 25:30.520
So it wasn't cool with me.

25:30.550 --> 25:33.680
I saw an opportunity,I took it.

25:33.720 --> 25:36.680
But I had nothing to do with tony falling.

25:37.610 --> 25:42.430
How did you happen to wander into suite 1116 at exactly the right moment?

25:42.460 --> 25:46.130
And how long have you been calling mr. Larsen tony?

25:46.430 --> 25:50.870
There are several kinds of trouble for you to choose from,mr. Costa.

25:50.890 --> 25:53.580
Stealing a camera off a dead man is one.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.300
Also on the table,murder.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.560
Ok. Ok. All right.

25:57.590 --> 25:58.840
So I know him.

25:58.870 --> 25:59.970
Knew him.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.390
A year ago,I used to work at this club where larsen got a lot of his pictures.

26:04.420 --> 26:08.080
He would pay me a finder's fee every time I'd call him when celebrities would show up.

26:08.100 --> 26:12.360
So the other day,I called larsen when I recognized the check-in alias of archie leach.

26:12.390 --> 26:15.690
Ok? That's one of whit coleman's go-to names.

26:15.720 --> 26:18.170
So,usually,that was no big deal.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.910
He liked to have business meetings there all the time,

26:19.940 --> 26:21.460
but this didn't seem like business.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.200
Why not?

26:22.230 --> 26:24.960
Because he booked room 1121.

26:24.980 --> 26:26.540
That's the governor's suite.

26:26.580 --> 26:28.290
Then he orders a bottle of champagne.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.760
Some roses and chocolate and an intimacy kit.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.090
What's an intimacy kit?

26:33.120 --> 26:35.210
A box of condoms.

26:37.090 --> 26:40.950
Do you have any idea who whit's guest was?

26:41.090 --> 26:42.930
What did larsen say when you called?

26:42.960 --> 26:45.900
I just,uh,left messages on his cell and home numbers.

26:45.940 --> 26:48.380
I told him which room to book.

26:49.550 --> 26:52.370
How much were you supposed to get?

26:55.050 --> 26:55.940
5,000.

26:55.980 --> 26:58.560
That's a big tip for setting up a photo shoot.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.810
Picture must've been worth a whole lot more than that.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.310
How much did you get for the photo?

27:02.350 --> 27:04.640
Nothing. I didn't sell the photo.

27:04.670 --> 27:06.190
I never had it.

27:06.230 --> 27:09.110
The memory card was gone when I got there.

27:09.140 --> 27:11.110
When I heard that somebody fell off that balcony,

27:11.150 --> 27:14.060
I went straight up to check up on tony.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.770
Listen...

27:15.850 --> 27:17.750
when I got off the elevator,

27:17.800 --> 27:21.070
whit coleman and his bodyguard were getting on.

27:21.100 --> 27:23.180
Oh,that's very convenient for you.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.810
You better hope they back up your story.

27:25.840 --> 27:29.180
In the meantime,you are under arrest for grand theft.

27:29.210 --> 27:32.440
And if there's anything I can do to make your stay here more enjoyable,

27:32.460 --> 27:34.230
please don't hesitate to ask.

27:34.260 --> 27:35.540
Thank you.

28:03.580 --> 28:05.100
Hello?

28:05.320 --> 28:08.210
Hello? Who is this?

28:21.670 --> 28:24.550
Whit coleman's bodyguard is on his way in.

28:24.690 --> 28:26.270
You need to get that?
No.

28:26.310 --> 28:28.060
What about whit coleman?

28:28.100 --> 28:29.730
He's shooting.

28:30.230 --> 28:32.920
But I'll be glad to pass along anything you want me to.

28:32.950 --> 28:34.390
What are you doing here?

28:34.420 --> 28:36.990
I represent hoyt here as well.

28:37.020 --> 28:38.460
Isn't that a conflict of interest?

28:38.490 --> 28:42.530
I would say it's rather a convergence of interest.

28:42.530 --> 28:44.720
Synergy,miss johnson.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.230
See,whit's not just a person.

28:46.260 --> 28:47.480
He's an industry.

28:47.510 --> 28:51.430
That generates almost $40 million a year,and employs over 100 people.

28:51.470 --> 28:57.030
And each and every one of those people depend on me for the safety and security of whit coleman.

28:58.630 --> 29:05.340
Is there anything in your job description about making sure that no photographs are taken of your boss that might be damaging to his reputation?

29:05.360 --> 29:06.060
Don't answer that.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.420
How much can you bench press?

29:07.450 --> 29:08.090
Don't answer that.

29:08.100 --> 29:11.450
Are you strong enough to throw a 170 pound man off a balcony?

29:11.490 --> 29:12.310
Oh,my.

29:12.340 --> 29:13.070
Don't answer that.

29:13.100 --> 29:20.620
Are you aware that a witness saw you and whit getting on the 11th floor elevator 3 minutes after anthony larsen fell to his death?

29:20.640 --> 29:22.380
That's enough.

29:22.410 --> 29:23.220
Seriously.

29:23.260 --> 29:26.470
This is what I'm talking about when I say conflict of interest.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.680
When I charge both you and whit with murder,

29:28.700 --> 29:30.760
who do you think mr. Blanchard's gonna protect?

29:30.790 --> 29:34.140
You or the multi million dollar industry that pays his retainer?

29:34.170 --> 29:35.200
Hoyt--
shut up!

29:35.240 --> 29:37.840
I'm sick and tired of covering for whit.

29:37.870 --> 29:43.100
I've spent too much of my life standing outside doors while that asshole screws around on his wife.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.960
I have the camera.

29:45.990 --> 29:47.650
I know whit wasn't alone.

29:47.670 --> 29:50.170
I just need a name.

29:59.690 --> 30:01.150
Jose diaz.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.300
What?
Shut up.

30:04.580 --> 30:05.980
No.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.840
How long have...

30:10.870 --> 30:13.110
jose and whit been intimate?

30:13.130 --> 30:15.120
Hey,don't answer that.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.660
She's been bluffing us all along.

30:17.700 --> 30:19.640
She doesn't have the picture.

30:19.670 --> 30:22.160
All she has is what you tell her,so let's get out of here.

30:22.180 --> 30:23.840
Why don't you get out of here?

30:23.880 --> 30:26.380
Are you saying mr. Blanchard no longer represents you?

30:26.410 --> 30:27.380
That is correct.

30:27.410 --> 30:29.910
Then why don't you get out of here.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.470
Fine.

30:38.340 --> 30:41.800
Those confidentiality agreements you signed were no joke,buddy.

30:41.830 --> 30:45.120
You be very careful what you say in here.

30:48.360 --> 30:49.160
You take care.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.060
Oh,you,too,sir.

30:54.140 --> 30:55.520
Don't worry about him.

30:55.560 --> 31:00.580
No civil confidentiality agreement can stop you from answering questions in a criminal investigation.

31:00.610 --> 31:01.970
Now...

31:05.070 --> 31:08.680
how long have jose and whit been together?

31:08.720 --> 31:10.100
6 months.

31:10.780 --> 31:13.270
When did jose arrive at the cielo?

31:13.310 --> 31:16.090
I picked him up at his place at 6:00.

31:16.230 --> 31:19.310
Dropped him off at the cielo 20 minutes later.

31:19.340 --> 31:23.100
I sent him up to the suite ahead of me.

31:23.350 --> 31:25.860
And did whit and jose leave the suite?

31:25.890 --> 31:27.620
I don't know.

31:27.670 --> 31:31.400
I couldn't just stand there listening to the both of them.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.500
So I took a walk.

31:33.590 --> 31:36.360
I came back around 10:00.

31:36.430 --> 31:39.020
Just as diaz was leaving.

31:40.710 --> 31:42.900
He was upset.

31:44.940 --> 31:48.260
I went in to see what happened.

31:50.120 --> 31:52.310
And coleman...

31:52.370 --> 31:54.880
was just sitting there.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.490
Crying.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.040
They had a fight.

32:02.130 --> 32:04.030
What about?

32:04.230 --> 32:06.360
Probably something like,

32:06.390 --> 32:09.250
why does this have to be a secret?

32:09.870 --> 32:15.350
Why can't we have dinner downstairs together like a normal couple?

32:21.160 --> 32:24.340
How long do I have to put my life on hold...

32:25.190 --> 32:29.150
for a few nights a month in a hotel?

32:30.570 --> 32:32.000
Is...

32:32.010 --> 32:35.680
is that a fight that you've had with whit?

32:36.840 --> 32:39.830
That's why you went for a walk,isn't it?

32:41.020 --> 32:42.960
So,for all you know,

32:42.990 --> 32:46.890
whit could've gone into larsen's room and thrown him off the balcony?

32:46.920 --> 32:48.580
No. Whit's not like that.

32:48.610 --> 32:50.710
What about jose?

32:51.240 --> 32:53.610
I can't be objective.

32:53.640 --> 32:56.570
Do you remember jose's address?

32:56.600 --> 32:59.830
Could you write it down for me please?

33:12.440 --> 33:16.330
Shoot! Shoot,shoot,shoot,shoot.

33:16.360 --> 33:18.940
We missed jose diaz by 6 hours.

33:18.960 --> 33:22.940
The doorman said that the moving van showed up and cleared his stuff out.

33:22.970 --> 33:24.080
No forwarding address.

33:24.100 --> 33:26.760
Just an envelope full of cash for a year's worth of rent.

33:26.790 --> 33:29.510
Tom blanchard probably got to him right after our first meeting.

33:29.550 --> 33:32.680
I'd be surprised if jose's still in this hemisphere.

33:33.540 --> 33:37.030
Might not have been blanchard who financed this relocation.

33:39.150 --> 33:45.380
Looks like jose diaz may have sold himself a very valuable photo.

33:56.110 --> 34:00.190
Ah,the notorious coleman photo,huh?

34:00.950 --> 34:02.610
If you had taken that picture,

34:02.640 --> 34:05.600
would you willingly open the door to one of its subjects?

34:05.620 --> 34:07.360
I don't know.Maybe it was a set up.

34:07.380 --> 34:11.000
Maybe the boyfriend was working with the photographer and then turned on him.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.210
A lot of money involve i maybe.

34:13.239 --> 34:15.929
Coleman's lawyer's been on tv saying the whole photo is a fake.

34:15.949 --> 34:17.170
It's been retouched.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.139
Looks pretty real to me.

34:21.150 --> 34:22.120
I don't know if I told you,

34:22.159 --> 34:25.570
some friends from the office are getting together after work tonight.

34:25.580 --> 34:27.179
Might be late again.

34:27.199 --> 34:27.820
Really?

34:27.840 --> 34:29.670
You're welcome to join us.

34:31.020 --> 34:34.320
No. No,I gotta work.

34:34.389 --> 34:37.090
Are you mad about something?

34:38.230 --> 34:41.409
Is there something you want to tell me?

34:42.900 --> 34:46.540
I,uh,I don't think so.

34:46.570 --> 34:47.860
Ok.

34:49.370 --> 34:50.949
Listen,I heard that message.

34:50.989 --> 34:52.489
What message?

34:57.790 --> 34:59.180
Fritzy.

34:59.370 --> 35:00.330
Fritzy.

35:00.380 --> 35:01.670
She calls you fritzy.

35:01.710 --> 35:03.240
What am i supposed to think?

35:03.270 --> 35:04.350
You're listening to my messages?

35:04.380 --> 35:06.500
I was here when the phone rang.

35:06.530 --> 35:09.170
And the machine went off.I'm not deaf.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.680
Ok,ok.

35:10.700 --> 35:11.580
She is michelle.

35:11.580 --> 35:13.820
Is michelle one of the people that you're going out with tonight?

35:13.860 --> 35:14.920
I invited you to join us.

35:14.940 --> 35:17.130
Knowing I'm too busy.

35:17.950 --> 35:19.870
How come you haven't mentioned michelle before?

35:19.970 --> 35:23.250
Hey,she is a U. S. Attorney,and I--

35:23.930 --> 35:25.930
did you listen to the whole message?

35:25.970 --> 35:27.160
Michelle and i are so close,

35:27.190 --> 35:29.530
she mentions I didn't even give her my new phone number.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.540
Did you hear that part?

35:35.050 --> 35:36.600
Right.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.060
Why--

35:45.090 --> 35:47.220
why didn't you tell michelle you had a new number?

35:47.250 --> 35:48.450
Because we're not that close.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.140
But you're going out to dinner with her tonight.

35:50.160 --> 35:52.690
With 3 other people. Yes.

35:55.660 --> 35:56.610
Oh,wait. No,no,no.

35:56.650 --> 35:58.560
You start this conversation then you walk away?

35:58.590 --> 35:59.910
No,no. I'm sorry.

35:59.980 --> 36:01.480
Look,I--

36:01.570 --> 36:03.190
I don't care. Really.

36:03.220 --> 36:05.840
I just--I shouldn't have even--

36:05.880 --> 36:07.940
really,I just,I...

36:07.980 --> 36:09.700
I just...

36:09.940 --> 36:12.440
I realized something,and I have to go.

36:12.470 --> 36:13.600
I'm already late.

36:13.660 --> 36:15.020
Wait. You're not late.

36:15.060 --> 36:16.510
You're jealous.

36:17.710 --> 36:19.560
I'm both.

36:25.690 --> 36:27.880
You bitch!

36:29.580 --> 36:31.660
You let them publish that filthy picture.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.360
Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to whit?

36:34.380 --> 36:36.230
Elvis,I need your help.

36:36.260 --> 36:38.270
Why should i help you,huh?

36:38.300 --> 36:40.900
All you're gonna do is keep harassing me.

36:40.930 --> 36:42.680
You're both liars!

36:42.720 --> 36:43.690
Liars!

36:43.730 --> 36:46.830
Elvis,if you don't want to help me,help whit.

36:46.850 --> 36:51.450
Listen,man,there are a lot of people who are gonna think he's got something to do with this murder.

36:51.480 --> 36:53.570
But you can help him,elvis.

36:53.610 --> 36:57.840
Now you said you didn't get any decent pictures of whit because they kicked you out.

36:57.890 --> 36:59.150
But you went back.

36:59.170 --> 37:00.200
Didn't you?

37:00.230 --> 37:04.000
And you got some pictures because you photograph everything he does.

37:04.050 --> 37:06.260
And I need those pictures.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.610
Not to embarrass whit,

37:07.640 --> 37:08.740
not to show the world,

37:08.770 --> 37:10.900
but to help him.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.700
Do you know jose diaz?

37:31.730 --> 37:32.370
Who?

37:32.410 --> 37:33.850
Have you seen the papers?

37:33.870 --> 37:35.350
I haven't seen anything.

37:35.380 --> 37:37.480
I've been in jail!

37:39.220 --> 37:46.510
They feature a rather scandalous picture of jose diaz and whit coleman in what appears to be the governor's suite.

37:46.540 --> 37:49.890
How much did the tabloid pay you,nicholas?

37:50.850 --> 37:53.800
You told me you had an arrangement with larsen.

37:53.850 --> 37:54.670
Yeah.

37:54.690 --> 37:58.300
And that arrangement was that you would call and leave a message on his home and on his cell?

37:58.320 --> 37:59.990
Yeah. That's correct.

38:00.030 --> 38:01.550
Did you have those numbers memorized?

38:01.580 --> 38:04.290
No. He gave me his business card.

38:04.320 --> 38:07.920
Would you happen to have that business card in your personal belongings?

38:18.360 --> 38:22.320
You realize this proves you're connected to larsen.

38:22.540 --> 38:26.230
Is there anything else you want to tell me,nicholas,this is your last chance.

38:26.260 --> 38:29.000
Yeah. I want a lawyer.

38:29.030 --> 38:31.330
I think that's a good idea.

38:36.960 --> 38:39.950
Ok,the state is responsible for your back alimony,

38:39.990 --> 38:43.670
but only after anthony's other creditors are paid.

38:43.700 --> 38:45.030
Anna.

38:45.780 --> 38:47.790
I've got good news.
Walk with me.

38:47.820 --> 38:50.450
Oh,go ahead.We'll figure this all out later.

38:50.510 --> 38:54.210
Well,it's good news,and not exactly good news.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.090
We found anthony's camera,

38:56.120 --> 38:58.490
and we found the person who killed him.

38:58.510 --> 38:59.140
Great.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.240
We even have a picture of the killer.

39:02.260 --> 39:04.920
Hold on. I need to set this down.

39:08.180 --> 39:11.200
Here we go. So...

39:12.070 --> 39:13.120
let's see.

39:13.160 --> 39:16.340
Oh,uh,do you recognize this man?

39:18.110 --> 39:19.380
No.

39:19.420 --> 39:21.500
Uh,what about this one?

39:21.860 --> 39:22.430
No.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.910
Oh,I almost forgot.

39:24.940 --> 39:26.560
Is this the camera?

39:26.610 --> 39:28.330
Yes. Where did you find it?

39:28.360 --> 39:31.420
This man from the hotel pawned it.

39:31.450 --> 39:33.030
He had a deal with your ex-husband.

39:33.060 --> 39:35.510
You can't trust anyone,I guess.

39:36.290 --> 39:43.890
Oh,and,these are pictures that were taken the other night at the cielo hotel by a stalker.

39:43.910 --> 39:45.310
Is that whit coleman?

39:45.340 --> 39:48.350
Right. And that's his bodyguard,and...

39:48.380 --> 39:51.260
do you recognize this person,anna?

39:54.010 --> 39:56.070
That's you.

39:56.840 --> 39:58.510
You have the right to remain silent.

39:58.530 --> 40:02.410
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

40:02.570 --> 40:04.250
You have the right to an attorney.

40:04.280 --> 40:05.950
If you cannot afford one,

40:05.980 --> 40:08.620
one will be appointed to you by the court.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.450
Do you want to talk to a lawyer,anna?

40:10.480 --> 40:12.270
What is going on?What are you doing?

40:12.300 --> 40:13.390
I'm trying to help you.

40:13.430 --> 40:16.700
I didn't do anything.
Yes,you did.

40:21.030 --> 40:22.670
This man...

40:23.620 --> 40:29.540
left messages on anthony's home and cell phone's telling him that whit coleman was gonna be at the hotel cielo.

40:29.570 --> 40:32.370
But nicholas costa didn't know that anthony had moved.

40:32.390 --> 40:35.910
So you heard the messages that were intended for your ex-husband.

40:35.940 --> 40:37.580
Am I right?
No,I...

40:37.610 --> 40:42.720
and then there's the question of this $300,000 put into your bank account this morning.

40:42.750 --> 40:47.510
It wasn't the million dollars that anthony was hoping for,but not bad.

40:50.210 --> 40:51.940
What are you talking about?

40:51.980 --> 40:54.220
Murder one.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.150
But there are some alternatives,anna.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.450
If this wasn't pre-meditated.If it was an accident.

41:01.470 --> 41:02.720
We're talking manslaughter.

41:02.750 --> 41:05.250
That's a whole different ball of wax.

41:07.570 --> 41:11.950
Of all the people that I've spoken to about anthony,

41:11.980 --> 41:14.880
you're the only one that seems to care about him.

41:14.910 --> 41:17.380
Which makes me think that...

41:17.430 --> 41:20.370
you didn't go to the hotel intending to kill him.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.090
Did you?

41:22.300 --> 41:27.080
Did you go to the hotel intending to kill your ex-husband?

41:27.250 --> 41:28.660
No.

41:28.690 --> 41:32.000
I just wanted to talk to him.

41:32.650 --> 41:36.380
I heard the message,so I went to the hotel.

41:36.410 --> 41:38.360
I went up to anthony's room.

41:38.390 --> 41:40.500
He was drunk.

41:40.680 --> 41:43.130
And really happy.

41:43.270 --> 41:46.580
He told me he was sorry for not paying child support,

41:46.600 --> 41:52.730
but now that he'd got his million dollar picture,that wouldn't be a problem.

41:52.760 --> 41:54.190
That must have been a relief.

41:54.220 --> 41:57.260
I didn't want his money.I wanted him.

41:57.300 --> 41:59.800
Did you tell him that?

42:00.940 --> 42:02.660
Yes.

42:03.460 --> 42:07.730
He said that was never going to happen.

42:08.080 --> 42:12.580
After all I'd been through for him,he was such...

42:12.630 --> 42:16.830
he picked up his checkbook and started writing me a check.

42:16.850 --> 42:19.470
It was like I wasn't even there.

42:19.530 --> 42:23.270
So I grabbed his precious camera.

42:23.300 --> 42:24.610
His girlfriend?

42:24.640 --> 42:28.350
And when he saw that I had it,he got this look on his face.

42:28.380 --> 42:32.550
He cared more about that stupid hunk of metal than he did about me.

42:32.580 --> 42:34.770
He told me to put it down.

42:34.800 --> 42:39.950
But I stepped on to the balcony,and I held it out over the edge.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.280
And that's when he came at me.

42:42.300 --> 42:43.820
So,what did you do?

42:43.840 --> 42:46.680
It happened really fast.

42:47.170 --> 42:51.940
We struggled,he hit the railing,then he went over the edge

42:51.960 --> 42:55.540
and I...watched him fall.

42:55.590 --> 42:57.650
Oh,that must have been horrible.

42:57.670 --> 43:00.360
You have no idea.

43:00.980 --> 43:03.300
He was the only one that I ever loved.

43:03.320 --> 43:08.160
I did not mean for him to fall.It was an accident.

43:27.720 --> 43:30.210
You'll notice right here...

43:30.610 --> 43:32.960
anthony's right hand.

43:33.190 --> 43:35.480
Bones are broken.

43:36.110 --> 43:42.450
It's from where your foot accidentally smashed down on them.

43:43.660 --> 43:45.440
He didn't fall right away.

43:45.470 --> 43:47.390
He was hanging on to the balcony railing.

43:47.420 --> 43:50.530
You could've saved him,but you killed him.

43:50.550 --> 43:55.680
And then you moved a chair over to the balcony railing to make it look like he jumped.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.690
You didn't love anthony.

43:58.730 --> 44:02.640
You told me yesterday,that you thought celebrities were hypocrites.

44:02.670 --> 44:04.130
Well,what about you?

44:04.160 --> 44:06.570
You told me you didn't care about the money,

44:06.600 --> 44:10.320
but you stole the memory card out of anthony's camera,

44:10.350 --> 44:12.610
and sold it for $300,000.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.680
You killed him for the money,didn't you?

44:14.700 --> 44:18.570
I don't care about the damned money!

44:22.670 --> 44:23.850
But you did kill him.

44:23.920 --> 44:26.570
Yes,I killed him!

44:26.660 --> 44:27.920
I loved him.

44:27.940 --> 44:32.910
He was supposed to love me back no matter what.

44:32.940 --> 44:35.610
I didn't want to come to this place.

44:35.640 --> 44:38.170
He did,and...

44:38.180 --> 44:42.240
these people took him from me.

44:42.820 --> 44:45.420
His obsession with these people.

44:45.450 --> 44:47.230
It ruined our lives.

44:47.250 --> 44:48.460
I just...

44:48.510 --> 44:50.990
I want him back.

44:52.020 --> 44:53.150
I want...

44:53.190 --> 44:54.230
I want him...

44:54.270 --> 44:57.240
I want him back.

44:57.740 --> 45:01.840
I want him back.

45:19.020 --> 45:20.070
Oh,hi.

45:23.570 --> 45:25.270
You pressed it.

45:25.890 --> 45:28.030
Yeah. I learned.

45:29.980 --> 45:32.630
So,you and fritz have big plans for the evening?

45:32.660 --> 45:36.400
No. Actually,he's going out with some work people.

45:41.760 --> 45:42.740
Good night.

45:42.770 --> 45:43.940
Good night.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.230
yeah?

45:48.150 --> 45:50.330
I don't suppose you might want to,uh...

45:50.720 --> 45:53.520
get a bite of dinner or something?
