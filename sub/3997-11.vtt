WEBVTT

00:01.573 --> 00:03.375
You know, maybe I found out too early.

00:03.409 --> 00:06.928
I was five years old when "Santa"
gave me my own fire truck

00:06.963 --> 00:08.463
and a teddy bear that smelled

00:08.514 --> 00:09.631
like my dad's cigarettes.

00:09.682 --> 00:11.433
That's not Santa.

00:11.467 --> 00:13.573
I just believe things
and go on believing them.

00:13.574 --> 00:16.053
If someone tells me a fat man's
bringing me dolls every year,

00:16.055 --> 00:18.535
- I just don't question it.
- You would've been my nightmare.

00:18.564 --> 00:20.804
We were on very strict
instructions from Rabbi Schmulie

00:20.805 --> 00:22.085
not to say a word until the last

00:22.086 --> 00:23.806
Christian kid found out
about Santa Claus.

00:23.807 --> 00:26.264
Ruining Christmas,
very bad for our brand.

00:26.299 --> 00:28.099
Well, whether or not
Santa's real, it's just

00:28.100 --> 00:29.580
nice to have something to believe in.

00:29.835 --> 00:32.304
Did you just say
"Whether or not Santa's real"?

00:32.338 --> 00:34.018
You don't believe in
Santa Claus, do you?

00:34.019 --> 00:34.139
No.

00:34.256 --> 00:35.657
Do I wish Santa was real?

00:36.208 --> 00:38.008
- I mean, yeah.
- Santa's not real, Winston.

00:38.042 --> 00:39.362
Shut up, stupid!
You're a dummy!

00:41.080 --> 00:43.815
So... and...
I don't even c...

00:43.850 --> 00:45.615
Like, you're the...
Okay, aw, here we go.

00:45.616 --> 00:47.816
You know what, look who's talking.
You're the same guy

00:47.817 --> 00:49.337
who only eats mayonnaise on game days.

00:49.389 --> 00:51.149
That's how you makee
the Chicago Bears win.

00:51.167 --> 00:52.927
Hey, Winnie,
were you a good boy this year?

00:53.676 --> 00:54.643
Really?

00:54.677 --> 00:55.977
Stop, guys, stop!

00:56.012 --> 00:57.132
Don't throw the cranberries!

00:57.133 --> 00:58.013
- Get him!
- Stop!

00:58.064 --> 00:59.224
- I don't mess around!
- No!

01:01.367 --> 01:03.185
- Truce! Truce! Truce!
- Go for the eyes!

01:03.236 --> 01:04.269
Truce! Truce!

01:04.303 --> 01:05.303
One got stuck in my ear.

01:05.337 --> 01:06.938
We got a cranberry in his ear.

01:06.972 --> 01:08.607
How is that even possible?

01:08.641 --> 01:10.121
Why don't you ask Santa Claus to take

01:10.122 --> 01:11.343
the cranberry out of your ear?

01:11.377 --> 01:13.645
I said it got stuck in my ear!

01:13.663 --> 01:15.297
Truce! Truce! Truce! Truce!

01:20.253 --> 01:24.189
<font color="#ff8c00">Sync & corrections by Alice</font>
<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:25.223 --> 01:26.908
These pieces don't make a full berry.

01:27.009 --> 01:29.049
There's definitely something
still stuck in there.

01:29.178 --> 01:32.214
Hey, would anybody mind giving me
a ride to the airport tomorrow?

01:32.265 --> 01:33.348
Full disclosure:

01:33.382 --> 01:35.500
It's out of San Diego
at 3:00 a.m.

01:35.518 --> 01:38.002
So tonight's our last chance
for a holiday hang-together?

01:38.020 --> 01:40.055
A group hang on the
Saturday before Christmas?

01:40.060 --> 01:42.060
: No, sorry, I can't
tonight, Jess. Office party.

01:42.061 --> 01:44.501
There are literally millions
of parties. It's a puzzle as...

01:44.502 --> 01:46.382
That's what you guys
are talking about, right?

01:46.416 --> 01:48.136
I mean, it's not like
I can hear anything,

01:48.137 --> 01:49.857
because I got a cranberry
stuck in my ear!

01:49.858 --> 01:51.066
You're yelling.

01:51.117 --> 01:52.837
Slade and Sienna
are having a house thing.

01:52.838 --> 01:54.920
Oshiro-San is serving
whale meat after midnight.

01:54.954 --> 01:56.538
- What y'all talking about?
- Shut up.

01:56.572 --> 01:58.657
Sadie is having
a cookie-decorating party.

01:58.691 --> 02:00.542
The gorilla twins
are having a thump-thump.

02:00.576 --> 02:02.494
Let's try to hit all
the parties we can.

02:02.528 --> 02:05.831
Otherwise, I'm just gonna stay
home and try not to call Sam.

02:05.865 --> 02:07.505
- What'd you say?
- I'm gonna die alone.

02:07.506 --> 02:09.533
And merry Christmas.

02:09.551 --> 02:12.087
- We have to hang out together.
- I hate that idea.

02:12.138 --> 02:13.221
I'll be designated driver.

02:13.256 --> 02:14.736
- I'm in.
- Okay, yeah, let's do it.

02:14.737 --> 02:16.038
The only we make this work

02:16.042 --> 02:17.709
is if we do the Irish good-bye.

02:17.727 --> 02:19.845
We leave the parties
without saying good-bye.

02:19.879 --> 02:21.799
And I'm asking you guys
as my friends to not be

02:21.800 --> 02:24.015
so damn awkward around
my stripper girlfriend,

02:24.049 --> 02:25.267
just 'cause she's a stripper.

02:25.318 --> 02:26.318
You are the most awkward.

02:26.319 --> 02:28.919
You should probably stop calling
her your "stripper girlfriend."

02:28.920 --> 02:30.240
She's unpredictable and exciting,

02:30.241 --> 02:30.881
and I love that!

02:30.882 --> 02:32.223
Ol' Nick Miller

02:32.241 --> 02:34.576
lives on the edge now.
Vroom! Vroom!

02:34.610 --> 02:35.727
And plus,

02:35.745 --> 02:37.729
we haven't had sex yet,
and we might tonight.

02:39.749 --> 02:40.782
I understood that!

02:41.333 --> 02:42.367
Yeah!

02:42.901 --> 02:44.005
What'd you say, though?

02:48.174 --> 02:50.041
Merry Christmas!

02:50.475 --> 02:51.576
Am I talking too loud?

02:51.610 --> 02:52.794
- Schmidt?
- What?

02:52.845 --> 02:54.379
- A word?
- What?

02:54.413 --> 02:57.215
You haven't said one word to
Cece since she got in the car.

02:57.249 --> 02:58.769
I cannot believe that you invited her.

02:58.770 --> 02:59.610
She's my best friend.

02:59.611 --> 03:02.171
- Hey, can I talk to you a little later?
- Were you hoping that

03:02.172 --> 03:03.972
I still had some soul left
for you to crush?

03:03.973 --> 03:05.693
I'm glad we're gonna be
mature about this.

03:06.192 --> 03:07.258
What happened there?

03:07.276 --> 03:09.945
Nothing. He told her
that he loved her...

03:09.979 --> 03:11.419
Okay, I just want to spend the night

03:11.420 --> 03:13.281
making it with some fatty
in an elf costume.

03:13.316 --> 03:14.899
Is that too much to ask for?

03:15.617 --> 03:16.691
Instead I'm stuck here

03:16.702 --> 03:18.403
at this Lesbian cookie party.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.989
It's all wreaths, no trees.

03:22.000 --> 03:22.640
All right, Jess,

03:22.641 --> 03:23.491
you're on the clock;

03:23.543 --> 03:25.610
You have five minutes
in this party black hole.

03:26.128 --> 03:28.288
- Your friends are cool.
- Yeah, no, no, I like them.

03:28.335 --> 03:29.775
- Yeah, they...
- I live with them.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.416
But being serious,
it's been really fun.

03:31.750 --> 03:34.910
I'm glad we're hanging out and spending
time together and all that good stuff.

03:35.103 --> 03:36.463
You know, to be completely honest,

03:36.464 --> 03:37.305
when I first met you,

03:37.340 --> 03:39.290
I didn't think that
you could handle this.

03:39.308 --> 03:41.476
Handle what? The fact
that you're a stripper?

03:41.510 --> 03:43.070
- Me being... Yeah.
- Are you kidding?

03:43.071 --> 03:44.512
: Me?
- Yeah.

03:44.564 --> 03:46.764
Is it good?
You're sweating a little bit.

03:46.798 --> 03:49.398
You know what, lady, I was born
on the wrong side of the tracks.

03:49.399 --> 03:51.186
I've had tetanus thrice in my life.

03:51.637 --> 03:54.105
- Ew.
- And look at what a badass cookie I made.

03:54.139 --> 03:55.991
That's the kind of cookie
Nick Miller makes.

03:56.025 --> 03:57.475
- Fine, look at my cookie.
- What?

04:00.663 --> 04:02.814
Yeah, but there are people here.

04:02.832 --> 04:05.033
Are you not into having
sex around people?

04:05.484 --> 04:06.551
Who are you talking to?

04:06.586 --> 04:08.703
- Yeah?
- I'm so open with sex, it's ridiculous.

04:10.339 --> 04:12.290
You could at least take your coat off.

04:12.324 --> 04:13.491
But I can't.

04:13.809 --> 04:15.510
Pastel walls give me the chills.

04:15.544 --> 04:17.212
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:18.497 --> 04:19.435
- My God!
- What?

04:19.435 --> 04:21.476
- What...
- It's Sam! It's Sam! Put your coats on.

04:21.476 --> 04:22.877
- We're leaving.
- Sam Sam? Where?

04:22.878 --> 04:23.958
Yes, he's right over there.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.440
He's talking to a woman whose sexuality

04:25.441 --> 04:26.801
I won't jump to conclusions about.

04:26.802 --> 04:27.722
What a situation, Jess?

04:27.723 --> 04:29.043
Forced to spend time with someone

04:29.044 --> 04:30.392
who ruthlessly rejected you

04:30.684 --> 04:32.644
after you told him
how much you cared about him.

04:32.678 --> 04:34.479
- Maybe...
- Damn, he looks good.

04:34.513 --> 04:36.414
Just wants everyone to get along.

04:36.732 --> 04:38.532
Okay, if he wanted
everybody to get along...

04:38.533 --> 04:40.013
I'm seriously freaking out right now.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.822
...then <i>he</i> wouldn't have acted
like such a callous lady jerk.

04:41.823 --> 04:42.694
- Lady jerk?
- Lady jerk.

04:42.695 --> 04:44.175
I'm seriously freaking out right now.

04:44.176 --> 04:46.136
- Duck! He's gonna see you.
- We have to get out

04:46.137 --> 04:47.697
of here, you guys.
Where is everybody?

04:47.698 --> 04:50.211
Yeah, man, see,
when a cranberry gets lodged

04:50.246 --> 04:52.196
in the ear, it hurts.
Look.

04:52.214 --> 04:53.381
- Psst, Winston.
- Hey!

04:53.716 --> 04:55.300
Do you guys know Sam's here?

04:57.536 --> 04:59.604
- Jess?
- We're Irish good-bye-ing. Go! Go!

04:59.639 --> 05:01.723
- Go?
- Go, go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

05:01.757 --> 05:03.341
Go! Go! Go!

05:03.375 --> 05:05.360
<i>All right, Schmidt, what's the address?</i>

05:05.394 --> 05:07.194
<i>Get ready, last year</i>
<i>this party had acrobats</i>

05:07.196 --> 05:08.363
<i>and caged snow leopards.</i>

05:08.897 --> 05:09.764
<i>What?!</i>

05:13.986 --> 05:16.404
We're all here together.
No drama.

05:16.439 --> 05:17.759
- Not bad, Schmidt.
- Thank you.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.800
Are they just gonna play
computer music all night?

05:19.834 --> 05:22.314
What are you talking about?
That's a really respected deejay,

05:22.315 --> 05:23.995
who was also an actor
on <i>Boy Meets World.</i>

05:23.996 --> 05:25.076
- Hey, Jess. Sam.
- What?!

05:25.081 --> 05:26.081
No!

05:26.115 --> 05:27.282
Why is this happening? No.

05:27.333 --> 05:28.733
- Please, I need to talk...
- God.

05:28.734 --> 05:29.284
No. Oh, my...

05:29.335 --> 05:30.869
I feel like a bird.

05:30.903 --> 05:32.037
That's just sad.

05:32.071 --> 05:33.591
- How are you here?
- Winston told me

05:33.622 --> 05:35.740
where the party was in
exchange for an ear exam.

05:35.758 --> 05:37.125
Winston told you what?!

05:37.876 --> 05:38.209
What?

05:38.243 --> 05:39.794
Jess, listen to me.

05:40.145 --> 05:41.980
I want you back, Jess.

05:49.088 --> 05:50.972
Are none of these doors?

05:53.326 --> 05:56.293
What, he just wants a relationship
now, out of the blue?

05:56.328 --> 05:58.608
: You never just dreamed
about him crawling back to you?

05:58.609 --> 06:00.614
Anybody who's ever been dumped

06:00.649 --> 06:02.983
has dreamed about that special someone

06:03.034 --> 06:04.652
crawling their way back to them.

06:05.203 --> 06:07.083
I mean, come on, right?
It's the dump fantasy.

06:07.084 --> 06:08.572
Let's workshop that term.

06:08.606 --> 06:09.573
Of course I have.

06:09.607 --> 06:10.658
We meet

06:10.709 --> 06:13.077
in a hospital, during wartime.

06:13.811 --> 06:15.829
You can forgive a lot during wartime.

06:15.881 --> 06:17.331
<i>That</i> is a fantasy, Jess.

06:17.382 --> 06:18.832
Okay, people don't change.

06:19.284 --> 06:20.584
They just think that they do.

06:20.618 --> 06:22.502
He's a player.
Think about it.

06:22.553 --> 06:24.713
Why would a good-looking
person ever become a doctor?

06:24.714 --> 06:25.973
Jess?

06:26.007 --> 06:27.758
My God!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

06:27.792 --> 06:28.893
Go, go, go.

06:29.627 --> 06:31.228
- Door...
- Jess?

06:33.514 --> 06:35.599
Jess, uh, I don't know
if you're in here.

06:35.633 --> 06:37.484
I just wanted to tell you that...

06:37.519 --> 06:39.153
I messed up.

06:40.187 --> 06:42.189
You know, I-I went
to that party to see you.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.108
I knew you were gonna
be there, 'cause I saw

06:44.142 --> 06:46.476
the comments on the Evite.

06:47.294 --> 06:49.597
"Amazeballs, can't wait."

06:49.631 --> 06:52.111
If you are here, I'm sorry if
this sounds a little rehearsed.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.792
This is the third room
I've done this in.

06:53.793 --> 06:54.673
Hey, what's he saying?

06:54.998 --> 06:56.598
- I want to hear...
- Shut up, Winston.

06:56.599 --> 06:57.004
Jess?

06:57.538 --> 06:58.923
- Jess?
- Yep.

07:04.445 --> 07:05.045
No.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.360
You just think you can come back

07:06.361 --> 07:07.881
and I'm just gonna be waiting for you?

07:07.882 --> 07:10.000
No, of course not.
I mean...

07:11.018 --> 07:12.169
I had to at least try.

07:12.187 --> 07:14.188
You're too late.

07:14.722 --> 07:15.806
I'm in love.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.374
What?

07:17.409 --> 07:18.726
With Winston.

07:21.613 --> 07:22.512
What?

07:23.230 --> 07:24.214
We've lain together.

07:24.215 --> 07:25.935
No, yeah, I don't know how it happened.

07:25.967 --> 07:29.737
It just got stuck up there
so far, so quickly.

07:30.288 --> 07:31.739
The relationship.

07:31.790 --> 07:33.550
You know, sometimes
when we're hanging out,

07:33.551 --> 07:34.591
it can get a little rough.

07:34.592 --> 07:35.993
- Boy, does it.
- Yeah.

07:36.027 --> 07:37.747
All right. Well, I didn't
know that, so...

07:37.781 --> 07:39.861
What's going on? I feel like
I'm missing something.

07:42.866 --> 07:44.001
Snow time.

07:45.035 --> 07:46.515
Hey, what are you doing?
No, no, no.

07:46.921 --> 07:48.721
Hey, everything is so expensive
here, Angie.

07:48.722 --> 07:49.873
Don't. Get off that thing.

07:49.891 --> 07:51.725
Why don't you get on?

07:53.711 --> 07:55.062
You know what?

07:55.096 --> 07:57.097
Get in the sleigh, girl.

07:59.717 --> 08:00.934
What happens in the sleigh?

08:01.986 --> 08:03.220
What happens in the sleigh

08:03.238 --> 08:05.906
is I'll be your reindeer...

08:05.940 --> 08:09.360
And take your toys up in the sky.

08:10.894 --> 08:12.546
Sexy.

08:16.618 --> 08:18.902
Ho ho ho!

08:19.420 --> 08:21.372
Here comes the chubby Santa boy!

08:21.406 --> 08:22.556
Get in here.

08:23.758 --> 08:25.075
This is real.

08:25.093 --> 08:26.877
We are...
This is...

08:26.911 --> 08:28.462
You are quick to the belt.

08:28.513 --> 08:29.596
Let's do this.

08:29.631 --> 08:31.415
You have been <i>Taken.</i>

08:32.133 --> 08:32.883
What's that?

08:32.917 --> 08:35.052
A nearly perfect Liam Neeson.

08:36.770 --> 08:37.938
No!

08:44.612 --> 08:45.696
No! This isn't...

08:47.265 --> 08:50.701
This is my nightmare!

08:54.989 --> 08:56.106
Merry Christmas!

09:05.133 --> 09:07.617
Hey. I know... I know
you're trying to avoid me,

09:07.635 --> 09:11.088
but just take this gift
I got you and I will walk away.

09:11.122 --> 09:13.757
I don't celebrate Christmas,
okay? Or as I like to call it,

09:13.791 --> 09:16.310
White Anglo-Saxon Winter
Privilege Night.

09:16.344 --> 09:17.627
I really want us to be friends.

09:17.645 --> 09:19.463
Whenever you're ready.

09:19.481 --> 09:21.098
Because I really do care about you.

09:21.132 --> 09:22.483
Thank you so much for this.

09:22.517 --> 09:25.135
'Cause this makes it so much better.

09:27.805 --> 09:30.307
Here. This is for you.

09:30.825 --> 09:32.860
What if you came home with me tonight?

09:32.911 --> 09:35.362
You look like a hot elf.

09:37.365 --> 09:38.532
Hold still.

09:38.583 --> 09:40.617
Got it.

09:40.651 --> 09:42.870
Thank you, thank you, thank you, man.

09:42.921 --> 09:44.921
Now that I think about it,
I mean, I'm not really

09:44.922 --> 09:46.282
surprised by you and...
you know.

09:46.283 --> 09:48.125
I mean, three guy roommates.

09:48.659 --> 09:50.139
If I really am being honest with you,

09:50.140 --> 09:52.340
you were the only one
that I was really threatened by.

09:52.863 --> 09:54.515
I mean, you got Metrosexual Jones

09:54.549 --> 09:56.300
and Sweatshirt Guy over there.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.001
What are we talking about here?

09:58.019 --> 10:00.354
Yeah, I would trade places
with you in a heartbeat.

10:00.388 --> 10:02.172
You know, except for the mustache.

10:02.190 --> 10:05.592
Can I ask you something?
How did you get her?

10:12.282 --> 10:13.400
Jess.

10:14.451 --> 10:16.537
Yes.
Yes, my love.

10:16.831 --> 10:21.041
Honey, we both know we have been
unhappy for far too long.

10:21.575 --> 10:24.694
I am not just a vehicle you get
to ride to Pleasure Town.

10:25.713 --> 10:28.415
Be gone, honky!

10:28.466 --> 10:30.717
This is for your own good.

10:30.752 --> 10:33.137
Say good-bye
to paradise, honey!

10:38.926 --> 10:40.344
We were never going out.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.897
Yeah, I got that.

10:43.431 --> 10:48.352
I mean, Sam, what am
I supposed to think?

10:48.386 --> 10:50.570
So what? I'm just
supposed to believe you

10:50.604 --> 10:52.555
when all of a sudden
you come back to me,

10:52.557 --> 10:54.241
and you tell me you
want to make it work?

10:54.275 --> 10:56.893
I-I want to believe you,
but I just feel so...

11:00.214 --> 11:01.415
No!

11:01.449 --> 11:05.402
No! Why do you think
you can just kiss me?

11:05.420 --> 11:06.787
I thought that was the right...

11:06.838 --> 11:08.205
That's all this ever was to you.

11:08.239 --> 11:09.923
- That's not true, Jess.
- No.

11:09.958 --> 11:12.576
No. I'm always so gullible,
and I'm not doing it.

11:13.094 --> 11:14.294
I'm not doing it anymore.

11:15.595 --> 11:16.546
I'm done.

11:16.780 --> 11:17.965
I mean, I get it.

11:18.016 --> 11:20.584
I'm... I'm too late.
I messed up.

11:20.602 --> 11:22.102
Yeah, you did.
You messed up.

11:22.636 --> 11:24.436
Well, I'll leave you alone.
Merry Christmas.

11:24.437 --> 11:25.439
No!

11:25.473 --> 11:28.025
I'm leaving you alone.

11:31.262 --> 11:33.542
I know... I know you do this
kind of thing all the time,

11:33.543 --> 11:35.649
but believe it or not, I don't.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.317
What? What does that mean?

11:37.368 --> 11:40.070
Look, I know for you,
this kind of stuff is normal.

11:40.104 --> 11:41.672
Doing it in sleds.

11:41.706 --> 11:43.426
- And...
- This is because I'm a stripper.

11:43.441 --> 11:44.625
Yeah.

11:44.659 --> 11:46.076
- Are you laughing at me?
- No.

11:46.110 --> 11:50.080
I'm laughing into me.

11:50.114 --> 11:52.432
- Maybe you just can't handle this.
- No. It's great.

11:52.467 --> 11:54.635
You're a stripper for now.
I'm a bartender for now.

11:54.669 --> 11:57.804
- For now?
- We're not gonna be that for...

11:57.839 --> 11:59.719
Okay, well, for now,
I'm just gonna walk away.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.791
For now, you can kiss my ass.

12:01.809 --> 12:06.230
Nick Miller... turning lemonade
into lemons since 1981.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.196
<i>Up on the housetop.</i>

12:11.231 --> 12:13.014
Click, click, click.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.872
You know, I just want
to say what's up to all

12:14.873 --> 12:16.652
my girls in the county
looking so lovely,

12:16.686 --> 12:19.538
like you always sometimes do.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.911
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:26.712 --> 12:28.032
What are you doing in this place?

12:32.952 --> 12:36.088
And we're back,
and I'm Dr. Gavin Daytona.

12:36.139 --> 12:38.874
You are live on the radio.
We got a caller Wendy.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.172
You are on the phone with
the doctor. What have you got?

12:41.727 --> 12:43.428
Hey. Hey, Doctor.

12:43.480 --> 12:46.682
This is Dr. Gavin. You're live
to five million people.

12:46.716 --> 12:48.750
- I actually, I-I had a guy...
- Yeah, you did.

12:48.785 --> 12:51.703
- I really liked him.
- Wah, wah!

12:53.239 --> 12:56.275
I'm right not to believe him, right?

12:57.526 --> 12:58.861
I don't know, actually.

13:00.295 --> 13:02.655
I think you're the kind of girl
a guy would come back for.

13:03.933 --> 13:06.418
Buh, buh, buh.

13:14.926 --> 13:15.761
It was a bracelet.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.095
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

13:18.096 --> 13:19.731
Tungsten carbide, because you said

13:19.766 --> 13:21.567
that was the most baller metal.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.841
That's what Statham wore
in all the <i>Transporter</i> movies.

13:23.842 --> 13:26.738
I just wanted to try
to find a way to say thank you

13:27.273 --> 13:29.124
for telling me that you loved me.

13:30.527 --> 13:32.878
Even if I was the wrong person.

13:34.562 --> 13:37.432
You're welcome, Cece.

13:38.834 --> 13:40.819
But love is stupid, okay?

13:40.870 --> 13:42.621
It is a lie.

13:42.955 --> 13:45.908
So, bah humbug to you, Cecilia.

13:46.442 --> 13:47.626
Bah humbug.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.995
Bah...

13:50.346 --> 13:51.747
humbug.

13:54.533 --> 13:56.051
Where is your girlfriend?

13:56.085 --> 13:57.769
I blew it.

13:57.804 --> 14:01.056
She's so out there and adventurous,

14:01.090 --> 14:03.374
and not afraid, and...

14:03.392 --> 14:04.792
She's probably bored of me already.

14:04.827 --> 14:06.267
I mean, she doesn't want to be here.

14:06.268 --> 14:08.479
Does Angie ever do anything

14:08.480 --> 14:09.597
she doesn't want to do?

14:09.631 --> 14:11.766
No.

14:12.050 --> 14:14.735
What's wrong with a girl that's
fearless? I think that could

14:14.736 --> 14:17.572
be good for you, especially
since you're such a chicken.

14:18.806 --> 14:19.908
Don't.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.265
Go get her.

14:31.453 --> 14:32.704
Is this on?

14:33.138 --> 14:34.422
It's on.

14:34.456 --> 14:35.940
Right on. Cool.

14:36.008 --> 14:38.810
Angie?

14:38.844 --> 14:42.380
I just want to say publicly
that I'm an idiot.

14:42.431 --> 14:45.717
I couldn't just put myself
out there all the time.

14:45.768 --> 14:47.469
It's too scary.

14:47.503 --> 14:50.688
I'm not as brave as you, but here goes.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.390
I'm very poor.

14:52.441 --> 14:55.176
Having a checking account
would be an honor.

14:55.194 --> 14:56.845
I'm a writer.

14:56.879 --> 14:59.330
I've written a zombie book.
It's terrible.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.916
I'm a slow runner.

15:01.951 --> 15:04.519
I'm obsessed with karate.

15:05.037 --> 15:07.322
Yeah, yeah.

15:07.356 --> 15:09.240
You are the scariest thing
in the world.

15:09.291 --> 15:12.877
And you're so goofy
to be going out with me.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.412
And I don't want to...

15:14.963 --> 15:17.031
Thank you for...

15:18.884 --> 15:20.051
Winston?

15:20.085 --> 15:22.771
Why don't you do me a favor, homeboy?

15:22.805 --> 15:24.372
Sorry I called you homeboy.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.508
But turn that damn music up.

15:26.542 --> 15:28.777
'Cause I'm about
to get sexy up in here.

15:39.555 --> 15:41.489
- No.
- Weird choice, but I'm going for it.

15:46.544 --> 15:47.745
Yeah.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.714
Good. See, I know
what sexy is.

15:49.748 --> 15:51.749
- What's happening?
- And I'm gonna show you

15:51.784 --> 15:52.851
what kind of...

15:55.337 --> 15:58.405
No, no. Okay.

15:58.423 --> 15:59.907
Is this, is this a lap dance?

15:59.925 --> 16:01.241
This...

16:01.259 --> 16:04.545
This isn't happening.

16:08.150 --> 16:10.601
Yeah, that-that's
the stuff.

16:10.635 --> 16:12.920
That-That's kind of the stuff.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.439
Sexy.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.812
Let me show you how to do it.

16:36.628 --> 16:38.863
Okay, Angie, Angie,
you're doing it all wrong.

16:38.881 --> 16:39.864
Okay, honey?

16:39.882 --> 16:41.082
Let me just...

16:41.417 --> 16:44.418
Eye contact.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.040
What are you doing?
You are as dumb as it gets.

16:55.714 --> 16:57.732
<i>- What the hell?</i>
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

16:57.767 --> 17:00.352
I just... I-I'm sorry, I think
I made a mistake about Sam.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.666
<i>- I think I need to turn around.</i>
<i>- No, you didn't, Jess.</i>

17:02.717 --> 17:04.997
- You did the right thing.
- You're right, you're right.

17:05.557 --> 17:08.059
- No!
- Come on.

17:08.077 --> 17:10.060
<i>No, no, no.</i>

17:11.830 --> 17:13.351
- No, no, no, no.
- We are so busted.

17:13.352 --> 17:15.066
Jess, you reek of booze.

17:15.084 --> 17:17.368
Winston threw a drink on me.

17:17.403 --> 17:19.563
- Turn on the waterworks.
- Just take the jacket off.

17:19.564 --> 17:20.531
We are so busted.

17:20.532 --> 17:22.413
There's two of you?
Come on, I thought we were

17:22.414 --> 17:23.733
in the middle of a budget crisis.

17:23.734 --> 17:24.575
Officer, I understand

17:24.593 --> 17:26.627
how this looks and smells,

17:26.679 --> 17:29.714
but I assure you, I would not
ever get behind the wheel

17:29.748 --> 17:33.134
of a vehicle if I had had
even a drop to drink.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.637
This has just been
the most crazy night.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.755
And I'm not going to cry

17:37.773 --> 17:40.392
because I believe in traffic violations

17:40.426 --> 17:43.144
and paying your debt to society,
but you have

17:43.195 --> 17:45.280
- to believe...
- I believe you.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.649
You do?

17:48.534 --> 17:50.318
- Why?
- Jess, be cool.

17:50.369 --> 17:52.404
Sometimes people tell the truth.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.072
You drive safely,

17:54.606 --> 17:56.607
and happy holidays.

18:02.114 --> 18:03.631
- Was that...?
- Santa.

18:03.666 --> 18:04.949
- Black Santa.
- We saw Santa.

18:04.967 --> 18:07.001
It was Black Santa.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.619
Santa Claus isn't even real.

18:08.637 --> 18:10.797
We got a black president,
we got a black Santa Claus.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.173
It was not Black Santa Claus!

18:12.224 --> 18:14.642
What a... that's ludicrous.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.010
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.312
Now, what is he doing?

18:17.346 --> 18:19.147
He should be at home getting ready.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.482
I believe.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.318
I believe Sam

18:23.352 --> 18:24.853
and I want to go see him.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.304
To the Black North Pole!

18:26.338 --> 18:27.822
We saw Black Santa.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.807
Black Santa Claus?!

18:29.825 --> 18:31.625
I am so sick of hanging out
with Christians.

18:31.626 --> 18:33.644
This is my last Christian Christmas.

18:35.329 --> 18:37.530
- Hi, I'm here to see...
- Do you have

18:37.564 --> 18:39.582
- family members in the hospital?
- No, uh...

18:39.616 --> 18:41.117
Then, you're not here to see anyone.

18:41.168 --> 18:43.569
- Visiting hours are over.
- It's Christmas!

18:47.924 --> 18:49.308
Okay, new plan.

18:49.426 --> 18:51.877
We're carolers.

18:52.611 --> 18:53.245
Gum?

18:56.182 --> 18:57.883
Boobs?

18:57.917 --> 18:59.152
Thank you.

19:00.086 --> 19:02.587
FYI, I'm totally fine
with what just happened.

19:04.307 --> 19:05.590
Schmidt, let's go, let's go.

19:05.608 --> 19:07.609
Look.

19:11.781 --> 19:13.615
Jess, I still think this is a mistake.

19:13.650 --> 19:15.401
I mean, what if he hurts you again?

19:15.435 --> 19:17.115
Sometimes people tell
the truth, Schmidt.

19:17.116 --> 19:18.404
Thank you, Professor ClichÃ©,

19:18.438 --> 19:19.805
just in time for the holidays.

19:19.839 --> 19:22.658
Hold it. Okay,
well, we should...

19:22.709 --> 19:23.992
Madrigals.

20:14.494 --> 20:15.794
Good stuff.

20:15.828 --> 20:17.548
Yeah, thanks so much.
Thank you very much.

20:17.566 --> 20:19.246
Okay, okay, everyone,
back in your rooms.

20:19.247 --> 20:21.216
It's okay, I know these people.

20:21.267 --> 20:22.307
- It's okay.
- All right.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.002
Thank you.

20:24.020 --> 20:25.554
You came back.

20:25.605 --> 20:27.573
Yeah,

20:27.607 --> 20:29.174
Jess, I know that you don't believe me,

20:29.192 --> 20:31.727
but when we met, I...

20:31.778 --> 20:33.729
this girl had screwed me up.

20:40.703 --> 20:41.887
I believe you.

20:48.194 --> 20:50.329
All right, you're in a hospital, so...

20:50.363 --> 20:51.497
A lot of hands.

20:51.531 --> 20:53.415
All right, Doctor, ease up, ease up.

20:56.369 --> 20:57.553
Cab it to the next party?

20:57.587 --> 20:59.204
Yes.

20:59.222 --> 21:01.056
Cece, do you want to come?

21:01.090 --> 21:03.559
I mean, I think there's
a cab stand, uh...

21:03.593 --> 21:05.594
Maybe it's down that way.

21:05.645 --> 21:08.397
Could be over there, I don't know.

21:08.431 --> 21:10.732
I didn't really give it away, you know.

21:10.767 --> 21:11.900
I'd never do that.

21:11.935 --> 21:13.702
Happy Hanukkah.

21:13.736 --> 21:14.903
Happy Moon Festival, Cece.

21:14.938 --> 21:15.921
Nope, not a thing.

21:15.955 --> 21:17.188
Happy Carnaval.

21:17.223 --> 21:18.623
You should stop while you're ahead.

21:18.624 --> 21:20.961
Where are Nick and Angie?

21:22.629 --> 21:24.763
In a children's hospital.

21:24.831 --> 21:26.431
Sexual animals, sexual animals.

21:26.498 --> 21:30.166
Shameless, just shameless.
