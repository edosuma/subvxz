00:01.101 --> 00:02.796
Myname is Michael Westen.

00:02.869 --> 00:05.531
I used to be a spy until--

00:05.605 --> 00:08.096
- [ Man ] We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.
- [ Whistles ]

00:08.173 --> 00:10.574
[Michael Narrating]
Whenyou're burned,you've got nothing--

00:10.643 --> 00:13.203
no cash, no credit, nojob history..

00:13.279 --> 00:16.407
- You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

00:16.483 --> 00:18.110
Miam i.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.812
You do whatever work comes your way.

00:20.887 --> 00:23.549
- You rely on anyone who's still talking to you--
- [ Laughs ]

00:23.623 --> 00:26.490
- a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend--
- Should we shoot them?

00:26.559 --> 00:29.392
an old friend who used to inform
on you to the F.B.I.--

00:29.462 --> 00:31.760
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.831 --> 00:34.163
- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.234 --> 00:36.395
- ifyou're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.937
Bottom line:
Untilyou figure out who burnedyou...

00:40.974 --> 00:42.965
you're not going anywhere.

00:45.945 --> 00:48.345
[ Michael Narrating]
There aren't many rules in the spy trade.

00:48.415 --> 00:52.613
There are a few "agreements " that
most intelligence agencies honor though.

00:52.685 --> 00:55.586
Low-level agents get traded,
not prosecuted.

00:55.655 --> 00:58.715
You don 't shoot foreign operatives
ifyou can avoid it.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.784
Andyou stay away from
embassies and consulates.

01:03.730 --> 01:07.097
[ Si ghs ] Mi ke, look, you know
I 'm up for just about anything...

01:07.167 --> 01:09.101
but this--
this is like cursing in church.

01:09.169 --> 01:11.637
I mean, technically,
this is foreign soil.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.194
No, technically, it's just trespassing.

01:13.273 --> 01:16.572
One perk ofbeing burned-- my crimes
arejust crimes, not acts ofwar.

01:16.643 --> 01:19.111
But does it have to be
the Pakistani consulate?

01:19.179 --> 01:22.512
Couldn't it be-- I don't know--Jamaica?
Those guys are probablyvery easygoing.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.641
And they're not gonna know
anything about Carla.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.776
Look, she's just an employee, Mikey--

01:26.853 --> 01:28.787
some agent they sent
to boss you around.

01:28.855 --> 01:31.187
- It's not like she burned you personally.
- You don't know that.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.623
She's all I got.
Look, if she worked in Kurdistan...

01:33.693 --> 01:35.627
the Pakistanis might
have a file on her.

01:35.695 --> 01:38.562
I don't know. I mean, the prints
she left on Veronica's camera...

01:38.631 --> 01:40.565
did not come up in
any government system.

01:40.633 --> 01:43.625
And my buddies checked around likeyou wanted.
They didn't come up with anything.

01:43.703 --> 01:46.137
That's why I'm making a new friend.
Look, I gotta believe...

01:46.206 --> 01:48.333
that the best intelligence
outfit in the region...

01:48.408 --> 01:51.343
took a few notes when she took offher burka
and started wreaking havoc.

01:51.411 --> 01:53.402
Look, ifyou don't wanna help,
I can ask Fiona.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.971
No, no. It's fine. Fine.
You guys need your space.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.483
Now that she's notyour girlfriend anymore,
I guess it's probablyweird--

01:58.551 --> 02:00.883
She was never my girlfriend, Sam.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.252
- Okay, Mike.
- [Michael Narrating]
Consulates are a great place...

02:03.323 --> 02:06.656
to renewyour visa,
payyour taxes back home...

02:06.726 --> 02:09.854
or find foreign spies
working under diplomatic cover.

02:09.929 --> 02:12.090
- [ Sam ] Hey, hey. Back of the I i ne ri ght here, pal.
- Excuse me.

02:12.165 --> 02:15.225
- [ Laughs ] Oh.
- Rich Franklin, Miami Herald.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.565
They called to say I was coming.
Of course they didn't.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.697
I need a couple ofvisas.
I'm doing a piece on foreign trade.

02:20.773 --> 02:24.971
I need visas formyeditor, one forme.
I needitpronto. I'm sorry.. I need it right now.

02:25.044 --> 02:28.104
[Michael Narrating]
Like all bureaucrats, consulate employees...

02:28.181 --> 02:31.617
Iive in fear ofa pissed-offjournalist.

02:31.684 --> 02:33.618
[ Si ghs ]
What a crock.

02:33.686 --> 02:36.678
- Si r, can I just-- I just would
like to get in front ofyou.
- [ Mumbling ]

02:36.756 --> 02:40.419
J ust for like two--
Look, do I need to speak Pakistani?

02:40.493 --> 02:42.290
Can you not understand
what I'm saying?

02:42.362 --> 02:44.296
- Sir, you are from the Herald?
- Miami Herald.

02:44.364 --> 02:46.764
I am so sorry for the mix-up.
Please, come to my office.

02:46.833 --> 02:51.429
Yeah, this guy takes cuts. This is how it works
around-- Do you gotta know somebody here?

02:51.504 --> 02:54.496
- You must be getting a lot ofthat lately.
- I'm talking about textiles here.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.508
I'm sure it's nothing.
[ Chuckles ]

02:56.576 --> 02:59.909
I hear it's getting harder and harder
to do business with Pakistan.

02:59.979 --> 03:02.174
[Sam ]
Anybodyhere take numbers?

03:02.248 --> 03:04.716
I'm opening a factory
in Lahore in seven days.

03:04.784 --> 03:08.777
If I don't get these sign-offs today, ain't gonna
be nothin' on those looms, sugar lips.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.790
- Textiles!
-Just take a seat.

03:13.293 --> 03:16.228
- [ Exhales ]
- Waseem?

03:16.296 --> 03:18.594
[Michael Narrating]
Most ofthe people who work
in a consulate...

03:18.665 --> 03:21.429
arejust municipal drones
enjoying an overseas post.

03:21.501 --> 03:25.232
- [ Chattering In Foreign Language ]
- But the head ofsecurity--

03:26.439 --> 03:28.430
that guy's almost always a spy.

- What's your problem?
- You need to loweryour volume, first.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.318
- This is my regular speaking voice.
- This is notyour regularvoice.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.986
- This is my regular speaking volume, sir.
- No, sir, it is not.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.792
- Don't patronize me, sir.
- Okay, let's start over.
[ Softly] Hello. How areyou?

03:57.570 --> 04:00.937
- You are shouting!
It is not proper for this place!
- Butyou're shouting back.

04:01.007 --> 04:03.737
- This is a volume
for a cattle market orvegetable cart.
- Please take a look.

04:03.810 --> 04:06.973
- Sign that and this guy is out.
- Do not tell me what to do. Who areyou?

04:07.046 --> 04:11.312
[Michael Narrating] Onejob ofa security chief
is babysitting the secrets.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.875
Ifone goes missing,
it's a big deal...

04:13.953 --> 04:18.083
even ifit'sjust transactional data
on chemical imports.

04:27.567 --> 04:31.901
Steal a few files, no matter how boring,
andyou've got leverage.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.598
- Si r.
- Yes.

04:33.673 --> 04:36.403
- I would I i ke to i nvite you to lower your voice.
- [ Quitely ] Okay. How's that?

04:36.476 --> 04:37.966
- Is that better?
- You're mocking me!

04:38.044 --> 04:39.978
- I am mocking you.
- [Michael Narrating] Playyour cards right...

04:40.046 --> 04:42.412
andyou can trade what
you've got for whatyou want.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.360
[ Michael Narrating]
In any covert operation...

05:02.435 --> 05:04.801
your first concern
is remaining undetected.

Whetheryou're infiltrating a military. base...

or getting car parts from your mom 's garage
without her knowing...

05:16.949 --> 05:18.883
staying invisible is tough.

05:20.953 --> 05:24.150
Michael! There you are!

I thought you couldn't make it.

- Okay, honey. Whatever you say.
- Yeah, thing is--

05:52.618 --> 05:54.984
What?

05:55.054 --> 05:57.955
Yeah, we're not, uh--
Well, we're still working together...

05:58.024 --> 06:00.492
but the other part, that's, uh--

06:00.560 --> 06:02.653
Well, we've closed the door on that.

06:02.729 --> 06:05.562
[Liquid Pouring]

06:05.631 --> 06:08.293
Why do you always do this?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.598
I didn't do it this time. She did.

06:10.670 --> 06:13.798
- Right.
- Let's play poker!

06:13.873 --> 06:16.239
I mean, exactly.
I mean, how does the boy...

06:16.309 --> 06:18.800
even find a loan shark
in the first place?

06:18.878 --> 06:21.005
- Theyellow pages?
- Sure. That works.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.412
Andy's in deep trouble
with that man.

06:23.483 --> 06:26.646
If he doesn't come up with the money,
they're gonna hurt him again.

06:26.719 --> 06:30.450
Oh, it'sjust awful.
Diane's been through so much.

06:30.523 --> 06:33.617
You know, Michael sometimes helps people
with problems like this.

06:33.693 --> 06:36.127
- We both do.
- Really?

06:40.800 --> 06:43.360
- Fi, what was that?
- What was what?

06:43.436 --> 06:46.200
"Michael helps people with
problems like this sometimes"?

06:46.272 --> 06:50.072
- Well, you do.
- The guy borrowed money from a loan shark.

06:50.143 --> 06:53.169
Yeah, a dumb thing to do,
but he made the deal, he owes the money...

06:53.246 --> 06:55.180
and we have no business
getting involved with that.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.274
He borrowed the money to invest
in his mom's retirement.

06:58.351 --> 07:01.980
Stupid? Yes, and sweet.
And now she's gonna lose the house.

07:02.054 --> 07:06.218
What is this about, Fi? You really care that
much about some ladyyou never met...

07:06.292 --> 07:09.557
Iiving out in Boca Raton
with a bunch of cats?

07:09.629 --> 07:12.325
- You owe me.
- I gaveyou the car.

07:12.398 --> 07:14.593
You owe me more than that.

07:14.667 --> 07:18.228
I wanna do this
because this guyAndy...

07:18.304 --> 07:22.468
chose to put somebody
he loved before himself.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.570
That's why.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.806
Let's go.

07:35.655 --> 07:38.089
- Hello.
- [ Cat Meowing]

07:38.157 --> 07:40.318
Phyllis said you were handsome.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.327
- Come in.
- And single too. Can you believe it?

07:42.395 --> 07:44.329
Yeah. Let's talk aboutyour problem.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.264
Uh, I hearyour son's having trouble
with a loan shark.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.301
- Andy's a good boy, a kind boy.
- [ Meows ]

07:49.368 --> 07:51.598
It's just he's a lot
like his fatherwas.

07:51.671 --> 07:54.606
He just doesn't always think.

07:54.674 --> 07:58.075
- How much did he borrow, Diane?
- $200,000.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.704
And the man said that if
he doesn't return the money--

08:00.780 --> 08:03.772
Well, he can't return it.
He doesn't have it.

08:03.850 --> 08:06.410
- [ Meows ]
- Uh, he a gambler?

08:06.486 --> 08:09.785
No. God, no.
He's a cell phone salesman.

08:09.856 --> 08:14.589
He invested it.
It was sweet, really.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.788
I mean, the cancer didn't get me,
but the medical bills might.

08:17.864 --> 08:21.630
So he was just trying to-- to make money
so he could take care of me.

08:24.103 --> 08:28.199
- What's going on here, Ma?
- Look, I have $200 left in savings.

08:28.274 --> 08:30.401
Please,you can have it.
You can have all ofit.

08:30.476 --> 08:33.570
Just please make sure
he doesn't hurt my boy anymore.

08:33.645 --> 08:36.774
No! Absolutely not!
We talked about this. This is my problem.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.317
Well, it's not just
your problem now, is it?

08:39.385 --> 08:41.784
- Who areyou?
- We're people who can help.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.254
[ Sighs, Mutters ]
People.

08:44.323 --> 08:46.314
[ Sighs ]

08:48.194 --> 08:51.925
- [ Meows ]
- I don't think there's anything we can do.

08:51.998 --> 08:55.331
- He says I gotta pay him, but I can't.
- Loan sharks are businessmen.

08:55.401 --> 08:57.631
We'll strike a deal with him,
set up a payment plan.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.900
- How much money can you still getyour hands on?
- Uh, none ofit.

09:00.973 --> 09:04.170
Iput it in this club,
andit's gone.

09:04.243 --> 09:09.545
- All ofit?
- It was a high-risk, high-reward type deal.

09:09.615 --> 09:11.776
Little... illegal.

09:11.851 --> 09:14.012
Oh.

09:14.086 --> 09:16.145
That's why the money
all had to be cash.

09:17.189 --> 09:19.350
Let's start from the beginning.

09:19.425 --> 09:23.418
- Okay. But, uh, can we talk about it outside?
- Yes.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.397
A few months ago I started going to Velvet,
this club on South Beach...

09:26.465 --> 09:28.933
- and I got to know the owner, Zeke.
- Zeke.

09:29.001 --> 09:33.097
He's a really good guy. He cut me in
on the club-- uh, partnership.

09:33.172 --> 09:35.163
I put up five grand.

09:35.241 --> 09:39.177
Dude, I'm telling you,
I saw dividends right away.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.476
Zeke would pull these fat wads of cash
out ofthe safe right in the back.

09:42.548 --> 09:46.382
- I mean, like-- [ Vocalizes ]
- Fat wads. Got it.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.579
Yeah. So anyway,
one dayZeke comes to me...

09:48.654 --> 09:51.714
says he can get me in on this new place
he's gonna open--

09:51.791 --> 09:55.192
200K, full partnership.

09:55.261 --> 09:58.958
Thing is, the club is in Cuba.

09:59.031 --> 10:01.727
Hence the cash-only thing.

10:01.801 --> 10:06.329
Shady, I know, but Zeke says we're looking at,
like, 1,000% return on investment.

10:06.405 --> 10:08.965
- Soyou went in.
- [ Scoffs ] Yeah.

10:09.041 --> 10:12.340
I had to get the cash together.
My mom's got bills.

10:12.411 --> 10:16.040
Anyway, so I go one day
to deliver the cash to Zeke's house.

10:16.115 --> 10:20.176
And I'm telling you.
The minute I put the cash on the table...

10:20.252 --> 10:22.186
the F.B.I. swarms the place.

10:22.254 --> 10:24.688
Can I tell the rest of
the storyjust to save time?

10:24.757 --> 10:28.056
The feds rush in, arrest Zeke,
but not before rushing you out the back.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.891
Zeke's underindictment,
but he's promising not to turnyou in.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.659
- Feds take the cash, but--
- At least you got your freedom.

10:33.733 --> 10:37.692
- How did you--
- Andy, you were conned.

10:37.770 --> 10:41.729
- But the feds--
- They weren't feds. They were actors.
It's a classic kiss-off.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.173
Zeke's a con man.

10:44.243 --> 10:46.268
[ Exhales ]

10:46.345 --> 10:48.279
I'm such an idiot.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.872
Look on the bright side.
You might get to keepyour kneecaps.

10:50.950 --> 10:55.580
Doyou think--You thinkZeke'll give me the money
backwhen he finds out I'm onto him?

10:55.655 --> 10:58.249
No, but there are otherways
we can getyour money back.

11:14.206 --> 11:17.607
Ooh. Look at her.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.407
And her. I bet she'd be fun.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.209
Are you shopping for me or foryou?

11:23.282 --> 11:26.080
You are gonna have to get back out there
sooner or later.

11:26.152 --> 11:28.382
No. What I have to do
is get back there.

11:28.454 --> 11:31.423
Now, Andy said Zeke's office
is just past the V.I.P. room.

11:31.490 --> 11:35.153
Good bet he keeps the cash there,
probably launders the money through the club.

11:35.227 --> 11:37.889
Hey, Fi. The cash, the safe.

11:37.963 --> 11:42.662
I don't understand whyyou refuse
to mix business with pleasure.

You're no fun, Michael.

Exploiting an asset is easier when theyhave a vice...

11:58.150 --> 12:00.345
an addiction you can feed--

12:00.419 --> 12:04.355
drugs, money, respect, women.

Breaki ng i nto the safe

shouldn't be too difficult either.

and I'll take care ofthis?

[ Chuckles ]

12:42.061 --> 12:45.997
This word right here
is a kind of, uh, spicy goat cheese.

I was trying to say "black pants."
My Urdu's a little rusty.

12:48.801 --> 12:52.032

-Just a friend who needs a favor.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.242

Well, I need a favor too.
I would like those documents returned.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.378
So, what can I do foryou?

13:03.449 --> 13:05.383
So direct. It's refreshing.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.978
I'm looking for a spy, a woman who worked
in Kurdistan about 1 5 years ago.

13:09.054 --> 13:14.356
I don't have her real name, but she's
very distinctive, very attractive, very forceful.

13:14.426 --> 13:17.486
I'm sure she made a big splash.
Your intel might have some info on her?

13:17.563 --> 13:20.361

more than whatyou have.

13:20.432 --> 13:22.366
Sorry. Wish I could help.

Come on, Waseem.
Pick up the phone, call back home.

13:25.204 --> 13:28.037
To land a gig like this in Miami,
you gotta be prettywell connected.

13:28.107 --> 13:31.042
I am, and I'd like to staythatway.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.578
So go ahead, leak those documents.

13:33.646 --> 13:38.777
I'd rathertake my chances than ask for
an eyes-only dossier on a foreign operative.

13:38.851 --> 13:43.652
Now, uh, how are
the peach mojitos here, hmm?

the most versatile tools in a thief's arsenal.

most ofthe time...

is a magnetic card reader.

key card, and he keeps it on him all the time.

- Can't you lift it, sticky fingers?
- Yes, I can.

- Yeah.

Trouble is, Zeke only lets
girls and marks past security.

has to play the fool.

- It's not a high-end safe.

- I'm opening a new club in Havana.
- Havana?

- Last time I checked, that was in Cuba.
- We deal onlyin cash.

No legal hiccups that way. It's gonna be huge.
The upside is enormous.

- Me? Plenty.
