00:04.677 --> 00:06.123
Previously on E.R.

00:06.133 --> 00:08.967
Sam, this is Mary Warner.
She's studying to be an E.M.T.

00:08.977 --> 00:10.292
Pull the blinds, bitch!

00:10.302 --> 00:11.408
What's going on?

00:12.303 --> 00:15.325
No, no, don't shoot! Luka!

00:15.335 --> 00:16.690
He needs to be
intubated. Please.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.595
You're gonna walk us out of here like
Old Steve's going back to lockup.

00:19.605 --> 00:21.059
Something's wrong.

00:24.751 --> 00:26.835
- Think about Alex.
- I already did.

00:27.626 --> 00:29.380
Find Kovac. Jerry's hurt.

00:29.394 --> 00:31.032
- You okay, honey?
- I think so.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:43.031 --> 00:47.188
Callahan, cordon off that area.
Don't let any witnesses leave.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.502
All right, come on around.

00:51.139 --> 00:54.973
Hey, you folks back off the perimeter.
Hey idiots, back off the barricade.

00:59.677 --> 01:01.310
What happened after that?

01:02.877 --> 01:04.803
I think they took
one of our nurses.

01:04.816 --> 01:06.330
In a van--
they just plowed right by.

01:06.345 --> 01:08.533
Sam. With a nurse...
Was there a nurse with them?

01:08.547 --> 01:10.133
I saw a lady.
The one guy was dragging her out.

01:10.167 --> 01:13.331
She works here. Her name's Samantha
Taggart. You need to find her.

01:14.667 --> 01:17.112
- Lily, how'd you get through?
- I snuck through oncology.

01:17.125 --> 01:18.722
- Is everybody okay?
- I'm not sure yet.

01:18.737 --> 01:21.072
Call the O.E.M.C.
and put us on medical bypass.

01:21.087 --> 01:23.963
We're closed for internal disaster.
And page Kovac.

01:23.978 --> 01:26.002
- It's his damn E.R.
- I'll get on it.

01:26.017 --> 01:26.842
- Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah.

01:26.855 --> 01:28.962
Main area's clear. We're working
our way back through the rest.

01:28.995 --> 01:31.813
Thanks. Admitted patients
need to go up to the wards.

01:31.828 --> 01:33.483
Don't wait for open beds.

01:33.496 --> 01:35.862
They can board them in
the hallways for now.

01:35.876 --> 01:37.842
Okay. Everybody else
is getting triaged.

01:37.856 --> 01:41.042
And we need to assess all
equipment for any possible damage.

01:41.055 --> 01:42.472
Some techs are
starting on that.

01:42.485 --> 01:44.300
I came in as soon as I heard.

01:44.317 --> 01:45.731
Thanks, Frank.

01:46.008 --> 01:48.171
Call Pratt. We need him here.

01:48.188 --> 01:49.441
Frank?

01:50.236 --> 01:51.960
Jerry's gonna be okay.

01:52.795 --> 01:55.522
Found this lady near the stairs.
Finish checking the back hall.

01:55.535 --> 01:57.401
Hey, is somebody with this boy?

01:58.906 --> 02:00.470
It's okay, honey.

02:01.946 --> 02:05.021
Hi. I'm Kerry.
Are you with somebody?

02:05.037 --> 02:07.103
Jerry was taking care of me.

02:07.115 --> 02:08.203
Where are his parents?

02:08.217 --> 02:09.442
They were on their way in.

02:09.455 --> 02:12.110
I'll take him up to daycare until
they get here. Come on, honey.

02:12.456 --> 02:14.203
You should have somebody
take a look at that.

02:14.237 --> 02:15.983
I'm good. This is nothing.

02:15.996 --> 02:17.361
Looks like something to me.

02:17.375 --> 02:18.963
Yeah, lots of
folks got it worse.

02:18.977 --> 02:20.590
Haleh? How's Jerry doing?

02:20.608 --> 02:23.061
We're waiting on his second thoraseal.
Abby's getting it.

02:23.075 --> 02:24.001
I'll be right in.

02:24.017 --> 02:26.562
Dr. Weaver, any word on Sam?

02:26.986 --> 02:28.500
I told you we
should have waited.

02:28.518 --> 02:29.902
Waited? We waited long enough.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.363
We would have walked right out of there
if you hadn't let her play doctor.

02:32.395 --> 02:35.332
- He okay?
- His insulin levels are peaking.

02:35.347 --> 02:37.180
- He needs some food.
- Peaking?

02:37.196 --> 02:39.722
Yeah. He's diabetic.
What, did you forget?

02:40.546 --> 02:42.141
How far till the switch?

02:42.156 --> 02:43.350
About ten minutes.

02:43.365 --> 02:44.591
Well, hurry up.

02:44.605 --> 02:46.402
We'll get him something soon.

02:47.587 --> 02:50.283
- Systolic's down to 70.
- Call for type specific.

02:50.298 --> 02:51.901
Another two liters
on the infuser.

02:51.916 --> 02:53.130
How you doing, Jerry?

02:53.145 --> 02:54.143
Decreased breath
sounds on the right.

02:54.177 --> 02:55.893
Yeah, because his
chest tube is clamped.

02:55.905 --> 02:56.941
You want him to bleed out?

02:56.958 --> 02:58.573
He needs to get up to the O.R.

02:58.585 --> 03:00.002
We're still waiting
on that thoraseal.

03:00.036 --> 03:01.331
Okay, I'll go find it.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.890
Hey, sats are dropping.
Okay, eight oh ET. Sux and etomidate.

03:04.908 --> 03:07.421
Abby? Abby!

03:07.705 --> 03:09.361
Abby, open your eyes.

03:09.378 --> 03:10.701
Open your eyes, come on.

03:10.716 --> 03:11.952
Come on, wake up.

03:11.965 --> 03:13.990
I need some help now!

03:14.008 --> 03:15.742
Where the hell is Kovac?

03:30.936 --> 03:32.521
I'm coming in right now.

03:32.535 --> 03:34.813
There's been a shooting.
Jerry took a couple of hits.

03:34.825 --> 03:36.262
They're trying to
stabilize him right now.

03:36.295 --> 03:37.211
And Abby?

03:37.225 --> 03:38.970
They found her in
a pool of blood.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.380
Frank wasn't too sure about
anything else. Listen...

03:41.395 --> 03:43.913
I'm dropping you off before I go in,
and I'll check in on you later.

03:43.947 --> 03:47.213
No, I'm coming with you. County
General as fast as you can, please.

03:47.535 --> 03:49.482
Sats 98 on room air.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.843
Deep breath in and out.

03:55.995 --> 03:57.610
What the hell happened?

03:57.626 --> 04:00.201
That training girl
stabbed me with veck.

04:00.218 --> 04:02.563
Sam did an intubation.
How is Abby?

04:02.575 --> 04:05.041
I need to check on her.
Six liters oh-two.

04:05.056 --> 04:07.550
Call me if his pulse
ox drops below 94.

04:07.566 --> 04:08.771
Easy, Luka. Come on.

04:08.785 --> 04:11.472
You need to be monitored
for at least an hour.

04:11.587 --> 04:14.192
- I'm fine, Kerry, okay?
- Luka, you were paralyzed

04:14.206 --> 04:17.523
and intubated.
You belong in the I.C.U.

04:17.536 --> 04:20.579
Hey... Oh. All right,
get... get him a stool.

04:20.596 --> 04:23.280
Pressure's up to 110 on two liters,
crits 35.

04:23.295 --> 04:25.411
- Fetal heart tones 160.
- Sounds good.

04:25.426 --> 04:27.231
Hey, Abby.
Abby, how are you doing?

04:27.247 --> 04:29.723
Oh, you passed out.
You were bleeding.

04:29.805 --> 04:31.232
Got a cramp.

04:31.247 --> 04:32.990
Probably vagalled
from the pain.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.441
Has it stopped now?

04:34.896 --> 04:36.653
Seems to have slowed down.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.450
No sign of abruption.

04:38.467 --> 04:40.950
Baby is moving around,
looks healthy.

04:40.998 --> 04:43.112
Congratulations. It's a boy.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.850
Could be a placenta previa.

04:46.865 --> 04:49.873
Uh. Uh, no. I... I don't...
I don't have a previa.

04:49.886 --> 04:52.950
They saw a low-lying placenta
on the 20-week ultrasound.

04:52.968 --> 04:55.421
That would explain the bleeding.
You may need a C-section.

04:55.435 --> 04:57.210
I don't need a C-section.
Call Coburn.

04:57.228 --> 04:58.322
She was paged.

04:58.337 --> 04:59.560
Dr. Weaver, Psych's here.

04:59.578 --> 05:00.702
Okay, I'll be right there.

05:00.715 --> 05:02.382
Kerry, move me to O.B.

05:02.585 --> 05:04.483
No. We still need a
sterile spec exam.

05:04.496 --> 05:06.432
Dr. Weaver, send me up to O.B.

05:07.568 --> 05:10.593
- Vitals?
- Plus 85. B.P., 112/78.

05:10.607 --> 05:12.131
All right, take her up.

05:12.147 --> 05:14.062
Hey, we're having a rough
time with the airway.

05:14.076 --> 05:15.740
It's okay. I got it.

05:16.245 --> 05:17.993
You should help
with intubation.

05:18.005 --> 05:18.980
Oh, no, I'm staying with you.

05:19.016 --> 05:22.472
No, no, no, I'm just going up for NST.
Just come up after he's tubed.

05:22.486 --> 05:24.221
Luka, it's Jerry.

05:27.517 --> 05:29.860
Okay, page me if
something changes, okay?

05:39.756 --> 05:41.290
County E.R.

05:41.306 --> 05:43.632
Sorry, ma'am, we're closed.
You have to call Mercy.

05:43.648 --> 05:45.682
Clinic is taking in any
walk-ins with stress reaction.

05:45.717 --> 05:47.733
Good. Thanks.
Abel, stay with him

05:47.746 --> 05:50.030
- until he's settled upstairs.
- Okay, Dr. Weaver.

05:50.045 --> 05:52.630
And we should discuss doing a critical
incident debriefing at some point.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.761
Maybe in a few hours.
Let's just get through this shift.

05:54.798 --> 05:56.961
I don't care if you're both docs,
you can't just barge in here!

05:56.995 --> 05:58.263
Chris, it's okay. It's okay.

05:58.276 --> 06:00.531
- What's up with Jerry?
- He's red-lined in the O.R.

06:00.547 --> 06:02.080
- And Abby?
- She's good.

06:02.096 --> 06:04.130
We sent her up to O.B.
just to be safe.

06:04.454 --> 06:07.182
They just called. Dr.
Coburn's on her way in right now.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.858
- Okay, great.
- Abby, how are you?

06:08.860 --> 06:11.852
Oh, I think I just must have hit
my belly when I fell. I'm fine.

06:11.869 --> 06:14.071
- How's the baby?
- Fetal heart tones 155.

06:14.086 --> 06:14.883
Thank God.

06:14.897 --> 06:16.910
- I'm just going up for monitoring.
- I'll come with you.

06:16.945 --> 06:19.310
- No, no.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

06:19.327 --> 06:20.940
We can play "Who
Had the Worst Day?"

06:20.955 --> 06:22.373
I'm fine.

06:22.715 --> 06:23.943
Really.

06:24.355 --> 06:25.711
All right.

06:25.728 --> 06:27.783
I'll come and
check on you later.

06:30.997 --> 06:32.791
Come on, come on. Let's go.

06:33.676 --> 06:35.330
Mom, I don't feel good.

06:35.346 --> 06:36.643
He needs to eat something.

06:36.658 --> 06:38.252
No. We're gonna get some
miles behind us first.

06:38.287 --> 06:39.821
No. He can't wait.

06:40.047 --> 06:43.622
Okay, get him something to hold
him over, but make it quick.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.373
- Come on, Alex.
- No. Alex stays with me.

06:47.528 --> 06:49.870
- I'll take her. Let's go.
- I'll be right back, okay?

06:50.498 --> 06:52.371
Hey, get me some chips!

06:52.385 --> 06:53.860
I'm hitting the head.

06:58.136 --> 06:59.981
Come on. Stand up straight.

07:00.727 --> 07:03.782
Be a man.
You're not a little kid anymore.

07:09.445 --> 07:11.723
I think you're going
to really like Canada.

07:12.915 --> 07:14.813
I like Chicago.

07:17.676 --> 07:20.253
More cricoid, Ray.
I'm about to crack the larynx.

07:20.266 --> 07:22.531
It's a big, floppy epiglottis.
I can't see the cords.

07:22.546 --> 07:23.450
It's a long neck.

07:23.467 --> 07:24.891
82 on the pulse ox.

07:24.908 --> 07:27.383
Pull out and bag.
Give me the flipper.

07:30.507 --> 07:34.260
If we can't get this in, then we're
going to need a straight, long blade.

07:34.276 --> 07:35.611
You okay?

07:35.626 --> 07:37.933
Let me know when
the sats are up.

07:39.736 --> 07:41.370
Tight wheezing throughout.

07:41.385 --> 07:43.521
All right, sit down, Luka.
Haleh, get him an albuterol neb.

07:43.556 --> 07:44.903
- I'm okay.
- It's bronchospasm.

07:44.918 --> 07:46.320
You probably
aspirated some saliva.

07:46.337 --> 07:48.920
- I can do this.
- Look, if you don't get treated,

07:48.937 --> 07:51.013
I'm going to have two
patients to intubate.

07:51.028 --> 07:53.583
Okay, grab an L.M.A.
just in case.

07:53.595 --> 07:54.902
Pressure's down again.

07:54.915 --> 07:56.281
Auto transfuse from
the thoraseal?

07:56.296 --> 07:57.973
Okay, let me take a look.

08:03.468 --> 08:04.760
How is he?

08:04.777 --> 08:07.412
He's okay, Frank.
Did somebody call his mom?

08:07.425 --> 08:08.822
I'll do that right now.

08:08.837 --> 08:10.733
She can meet us up in the O.R.

08:11.405 --> 08:13.292
Yeah, let's hope so.

08:19.275 --> 08:22.701
Hey, grab what you need.

08:48.025 --> 08:49.723
You planning on
paying for those?

08:52.147 --> 08:53.781
No stealing, baby.

08:54.848 --> 08:57.051
Yeah, these people
work for a living.

08:57.155 --> 08:59.570
- He's bradying down.
- Should I get Weaver?

08:59.585 --> 09:02.522
If you enter the trachea,
you'll feel clicks

09:02.537 --> 09:06.160
when you pass over the
cartilagenous rings.

09:06.178 --> 09:07.912
Heart rate's only 50.

09:07.928 --> 09:09.362
Click.

09:09.606 --> 09:11.990
Click. Click.

09:12.007 --> 09:15.001
Okay, hold it right there.
Ray, pass an eight-oh.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.143
All right.

09:18.406 --> 09:19.831
Here you go.

09:21.126 --> 09:22.981
Okay, advance the tube.

09:27.637 --> 09:30.671
- No, it doesn't want to pass.
- Down to 40. Amp of atropine.

09:30.688 --> 09:32.790
Rotate counterclockwise.

09:34.337 --> 09:36.802
It's caught up on something.

09:38.627 --> 09:40.161
There we go!

09:40.556 --> 09:41.743
Okay.

09:46.638 --> 09:48.632
End tidal CO2?

09:49.976 --> 09:52.822
- Sensor is yellow.
- Yellow means yes.

09:53.537 --> 09:55.061
I thought you were
bringing him up.

09:55.078 --> 09:56.723
A little problem.
We're ready to roll.

09:56.736 --> 09:58.292
- How's his pressure?
- Up to 95 systolic.

09:58.328 --> 10:01.212
Four units O neg, two liters
autotransfused off the cell saver.

10:01.225 --> 10:04.312
Everybody upstairs is doing everything
we can to help you guys out.

10:08.087 --> 10:09.813
Well, baby looks good.

10:09.827 --> 10:11.813
But you are
definitely contracting.

10:11.827 --> 10:13.580
- I don't feel anything.
- Sometimes you don't.

10:13.706 --> 10:15.860
I think the belly trauma
put you into preterm labor.

10:15.877 --> 10:18.402
The baby's head dropped down,
caused a little placental bleeding.

10:18.435 --> 10:21.073
Okay, well, it's too soon,
so give me terbutaline.

10:21.085 --> 10:23.212
Well, you need magnesium.
I know you know that Abby.

10:23.225 --> 10:24.900
I remember all the times you gave
it when you were a nurse up here.

10:24.936 --> 10:27.831
Mag makes you feel like crap, so why
don't we just start with the terb?

10:27.848 --> 10:31.112
Terbutaline can mask the signs
and symptoms of abruption.

10:33.635 --> 10:35.171
I didn't know that.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.792
Today, you're the patient,
not the doctor.

10:40.815 --> 10:42.962
I'm not having an abruption.

10:43.225 --> 10:44.752
Not right now.

10:44.995 --> 10:46.741
But the trauma
puts you at risk.

10:46.758 --> 10:49.061
And if you do abrupt,
we need to know right away.

10:50.598 --> 10:52.831
So you can do a C-section.

10:59.567 --> 11:02.080
Uh, four gram load,
then two an hour.

11:02.638 --> 11:05.013
You let me know if you
have any more pain.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.223
You got my chips?

11:19.237 --> 11:20.652
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:20.666 --> 11:21.970
Oh, is that the key
to the restroom?

11:22.007 --> 11:23.543
Yeah, but I'm warning you,
it's nasty in there.

11:23.576 --> 11:25.010
No, no, we need to leave.

11:25.027 --> 11:27.663
Let the girl take a pee.
We can't hold it in like you guys.

11:27.678 --> 11:30.351
Hey, can I have my chips?

11:30.367 --> 11:32.433
I'm starving. Thank you.

12:22.897 --> 12:25.251
Next time you try
something like that,

12:25.267 --> 12:27.320
I'll take it out on your kid.

12:34.136 --> 12:35.872
You're definitely
not contracting.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.710
Contractions don't
last this long.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.413
When did the pain start?

12:39.428 --> 12:41.091
About 15 minutes ago.

12:41.106 --> 12:42.570
How bad, one to ten?

12:42.585 --> 12:44.513
I don't know--
like a four maybe.

12:44.526 --> 12:47.533
But it's probably just a
bruise from when I fell down.

12:47.547 --> 12:49.341
I just need some
Tylenol or something.

12:49.356 --> 12:50.933
There's no evidence
of abruption.

12:50.947 --> 12:51.620
Great.

12:51.636 --> 12:53.123
See? I told you.

12:53.137 --> 12:56.631
CBC with platelets.
PT/PTT, fibrinogen,

12:56.648 --> 12:58.083
D-dimer and FDPs.

12:58.097 --> 12:59.182
Why? What for?

12:59.195 --> 13:01.431
Only 20% of abruptions
have ultrasound findings.

13:01.445 --> 13:03.501
Let's send the labs to be sure.

13:05.527 --> 13:07.743
The baby looks great.
The heart rate's good,

13:07.758 --> 13:10.102
- excellent variability.
- Abby, Abby, hey.

13:10.115 --> 13:12.672
Here's what I would say to
you if you weren't a doctor:

13:12.686 --> 13:15.092
If the placenta separates
from the womb and bleeds,

13:15.107 --> 13:17.062
then the baby can be
deprived of oxygen.

13:17.077 --> 13:19.491
Now, even if we don't
see a blood clot,

13:19.505 --> 13:23.313
the labs will give us advance
warning before the baby's in trouble.

13:23.807 --> 13:25.122
Okay.

13:25.286 --> 13:28.161
- 12 of betamethasone.
- Oh, come on!

13:28.177 --> 13:30.872
We have to mature the baby's lungs
in case of an emergent birth.

13:30.887 --> 13:33.921
No, no, no, no, no!

13:37.268 --> 13:39.152
I have two and a half
months left to go.

13:39.167 --> 13:41.130
This baby is not
coming until then.

13:41.147 --> 13:42.502
That's what we're
all hoping for.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.580
I can wait two more weeks.

13:44.985 --> 13:47.872
The risk of prematurity goes
way down at that point.

13:47.886 --> 13:50.270
I can wait. I'll go 
on bed rest, I'll use a bedpan,

13:50.288 --> 13:51.993
I won't move.

13:52.007 --> 13:54.361
You know that I want you
to have a healthy baby.

13:54.827 --> 13:57.303
Then why do you keep focusing
on a worst-case scenario?

13:57.317 --> 13:58.791
That's her job.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.411
Eight monitored beds
are good to go.

14:19.427 --> 14:20.581
Night staff's been called?

14:20.595 --> 14:21.972
They're all coming
in except two.

14:21.988 --> 14:23.103
Did you check on Sam?

14:23.117 --> 14:25.113
My guy at the district called--
they still have no leads.

14:25.148 --> 14:27.342
O.E.M.C.'s on the line.
They want to know where we're at.

14:27.378 --> 14:29.922
Okay, tell them we can take
four critical paramedic runs,

14:29.937 --> 14:31.981
then back and bypass till
we see how we're doing.

14:31.995 --> 14:33.840
We got a lot of people showing
up outside for treatment.

14:33.875 --> 14:37.810
We'll take care of it. Chuny, let's
set up fast track in the west lobby.

14:37.828 --> 14:40.180
We'll speed through anybody who
doesn't need X rays or labs.

14:40.217 --> 14:42.390
- Pratt.
- All right, I'll help set it up.

14:45.735 --> 14:48.581
Great. How long is
this going to take?

14:56.955 --> 14:58.692
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

14:58.708 --> 14:59.700
You're going to
get us all killed.

14:59.738 --> 15:02.253
Relax. We can make it.
The train's probably a mile away.

15:16.348 --> 15:18.252
Oh, son of a bitch.

15:29.937 --> 15:32.340
All right...
everybody be cool--

15:32.355 --> 15:34.160
nobody gets hurt.

15:55.056 --> 15:57.151
License and proof of insurance.

15:58.595 --> 16:00.513
We're on our way to the lake

16:00.527 --> 16:02.850
so my son can get some
fishing in before dark.

16:02.907 --> 16:04.523
It's his birthday.

16:04.915 --> 16:06.572
I'll be right back.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.482
That's good.

16:13.495 --> 16:15.342
He's just going to
give us a ticket.

16:15.355 --> 16:17.242
What's he doing back there?

16:17.528 --> 16:19.133
He's a local yokel, man.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.081
This is the most excitement
he's had all day.

16:21.098 --> 16:22.542
He's probably
calling for backup.

16:22.556 --> 16:23.151
Sammy...

16:23.168 --> 16:26.353
Every cop within a thousand-mile
radius knows what you three look like.

16:26.367 --> 16:28.250
He's taking too long. Screw it.

16:32.268 --> 16:35.621
So, they're trying to find the source
of the bleeding and tie it off.

16:35.638 --> 16:37.722
Oh, my Jerry's not
the hearty type.

16:37.735 --> 16:40.582
I only hope he doesn't
wilt under all this.

16:40.596 --> 16:43.922
He had a good blood pressure and
a good pulse when we left the ER.

16:43.938 --> 16:45.292
Oh, the ER.

16:45.306 --> 16:47.890
This would never have
happened if he didn't insist

16:47.907 --> 16:50.193
on working at the
fakakta cesspool.

16:50.207 --> 16:52.912
Well, as long as the surgeons
find the bleeding and stop it,

16:52.925 --> 16:54.023
he should be fine.

16:54.037 --> 16:56.183
He could have gone to law school,
you know.

16:56.198 --> 16:57.111
Oh, I didn't realize that.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.652
I myself sent the
application to Harvard.

16:59.668 --> 17:00.611
Harvard.

17:00.625 --> 17:02.851
But no, he wouldn't go.

17:02.865 --> 17:05.590
That's, uh...
Jerry got into Harvard, wow.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.342
No, they rejected him.
Four times.

17:08.355 --> 17:10.951
- But that's not the point.
- No, of course it isn't.

17:10.968 --> 17:13.321
So how much is all
this going to cost us?

17:13.338 --> 17:15.002
Um, I don't really know.

17:15.017 --> 17:17.473
I'm sure his health
insurance will cover it.

17:17.486 --> 17:20.291
Oh, but they don't cover
the deductibles, do they?

17:20.308 --> 17:22.361
You know who covers
the deductibles?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.650
Me. I cover the deductibles.

17:24.667 --> 17:26.760
Why don't you wait here, okay?

17:26.775 --> 17:29.523
And I will talk about this
with you as much as you want,

17:29.537 --> 17:31.341
but I'll go see how
he's doing first, okay?

17:31.356 --> 17:33.393
He doesn't have any savings,
you know.

17:33.405 --> 17:34.750
But why would he?

17:34.765 --> 17:38.922
He can barely survive
off that weekly insult

17:38.937 --> 17:41.703
you people call a paycheck.

17:43.235 --> 17:44.602
How's he doing?

17:44.618 --> 17:46.450
The bullet nicked
the right ventricle.

17:46.467 --> 17:48.783
Damn it.
I was hoping it missed the heart.

17:48.797 --> 17:50.931
Another three-oh
prolene on a pledget.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.510
Eighth unit going up.

17:52.525 --> 17:54.212
Systolic's 85.

17:54.225 --> 17:57.063
A cardiac defect isn't so bad.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.532
I mean, it's repairable, right?

17:58.547 --> 18:00.130
It's not like he
needs a pneumonectomy.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.492
Metz.

18:02.288 --> 18:04.592
Looks dry. Barely any oozing.

18:06.008 --> 18:07.111
V-tach.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.352
Internal paddles.

18:08.368 --> 18:09.780
Lost the pulse.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.641
20 Joules.

18:12.657 --> 18:14.361
Oh, God.

18:14.395 --> 18:16.122
- Charged.
- Clear.

18:19.115 --> 18:21.012
- Still tach.
- Come on, Jerry.

18:21.027 --> 18:22.532
Charge to 50.

18:23.178 --> 18:24.621
Clear.

18:24.807 --> 18:27.050
- No change.
- Damn it.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.002
Starting internal compressions.

18:29.018 --> 18:30.710
Why is he in V-tach?

18:30.725 --> 18:32.260
Elevated potassium?

18:32.278 --> 18:34.773
T-waves aren't peaked,
but we've got S.T. elevations.

18:34.788 --> 18:36.301
He's having a heart attack.

18:36.318 --> 18:37.801
What about hypocalcemia?

18:37.817 --> 18:40.131
Could be. High doses of
citrates with the transfusions.

18:40.145 --> 18:42.070
Amp of calcium chloride.

18:42.087 --> 18:44.562
- Excuse me, Dr. Dubenko?
- Not now, Neela.

18:44.577 --> 18:45.773
Epi's on board.

18:45.786 --> 18:48.091
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but is it possible

18:48.108 --> 18:50.120
the suture is tying off
the coronary artery?

18:50.137 --> 18:51.190
What? Say that again.

18:51.207 --> 18:54.113
If you occluded the coronary artery
with the stitch, you'd have an MI.

18:54.126 --> 18:57.101
That's a good call.
I'm near the RCA. 11 blade.

18:57.116 --> 18:58.170
Charged to 20.

18:58.187 --> 18:59.832
You could see inside the field?

18:59.845 --> 19:01.521
I just had a hunch.

19:01.536 --> 19:03.070
Sutures cut.

19:03.605 --> 19:04.862
Clear.

19:10.797 --> 19:12.021
Sinus.

19:12.037 --> 19:13.653
Way to go.

19:13.666 --> 19:16.160
Okay we'll go on a bypass
for a coronary graft.

19:16.176 --> 19:17.313
Call the profusionists.

19:17.328 --> 19:18.920
We'll reposition
for a clam shell.

19:18.935 --> 19:21.880
Neela, scrub in.
I need another set of hands down here.

19:32.945 --> 19:34.353
Oh, man!

19:39.746 --> 19:41.711
They know where we're going,
they know what we're driving.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.843
Just let us out.
Please, you don't need us anymore.

19:43.857 --> 19:45.340
You're not prisoners,
you're my family!

19:45.378 --> 19:46.890
You're going to get
your family killed.

19:46.925 --> 19:48.560
Is that what you want?

19:52.916 --> 19:54.071
Steve!

19:57.716 --> 19:59.221
What are you doing?

20:09.417 --> 20:11.421
Now the cops are going to
be crawling everywhere.

20:11.436 --> 20:13.060
So what?
We'll get further off the grid.

20:13.078 --> 20:15.140
They didn't even know what
direction we were headed until now.

20:15.176 --> 20:17.182
Then we'll change the
direction, asshole.

20:17.198 --> 20:19.620
Steve, please,
just let us out, okay?

20:19.636 --> 20:21.263
I can go back and
check on that cop.

20:21.278 --> 20:23.311
Shut the hell up, Sam!

20:23.327 --> 20:24.441
Shut up!

20:24.455 --> 20:25.602
You're not leaving.

20:25.615 --> 20:26.821
Nobody's leaving.

20:26.837 --> 20:28.151
Do you understand that?

20:28.167 --> 20:29.581
Does everybody understand that?

20:29.597 --> 20:31.581
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, chill.

20:31.598 --> 20:34.300
Hey, hey, hey, easy man.

20:37.035 --> 20:39.460
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm, I'm fine.

20:40.675 --> 20:42.923
Sam probably saved your life.

20:43.538 --> 20:45.303
I hope she's all right.

20:46.356 --> 20:47.493
How's he doing?

20:47.505 --> 20:48.892
Good.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.793
Turn and see for yourself.

20:50.805 --> 20:53.982
No, the magnesium has
drained all my life force.

20:56.688 --> 20:58.520
We're so not ready for this.

20:58.537 --> 20:59.971
No one's ever ready for this.

20:59.987 --> 21:03.961
Yeah, but we don't even have
a car seat or a stroller.

21:03.975 --> 21:05.683
We have a crib.

21:06.347 --> 21:08.463
We don't even have a name.

21:09.676 --> 21:13.331
I was kind of hoping we could
name him after my father.

21:13.786 --> 21:15.921
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:15.938 --> 21:20.153
He would really love to have
a grandson named Mongo.

21:22.605 --> 21:24.341
Mo... Mongo?

21:24.355 --> 21:26.961
It's a very popular
name in Croatia.

21:32.288 --> 21:34.000
I'm just kidding!

21:37.976 --> 21:41.630
My father's name is Joseph. I don't
care how we're going to call him.

21:41.646 --> 21:43.382
It's not funny.

21:46.747 --> 21:48.903
Oh, my God!

21:48.918 --> 21:49.981
What is it, contraction?

21:49.998 --> 21:52.262
I don't know.
I think my water broke.

21:55.697 --> 21:56.943
What are you doing?

21:56.956 --> 21:58.472
Opening up your saline.

22:00.255 --> 22:01.920
Need some help in here!

22:01.936 --> 22:04.202
Are you sure it's
not a contraction?

22:04.217 --> 22:05.882
Nothing on the monitor.

22:06.846 --> 22:08.010
What's that?

22:08.027 --> 22:09.270
His heart rate's dropping.

22:09.285 --> 22:10.402
Oh, God. How low?

22:10.418 --> 22:12.212
Okay, get on your
left side now.

22:12.226 --> 22:13.620
Abby...

22:13.876 --> 22:15.501
Sharp pain, gush of blood.

22:15.515 --> 22:17.851
Baby's heart rate is in the 60s.
We're going to the OR.

22:17.868 --> 22:19.593
- Is it abruption?
- Looks that way.

22:19.605 --> 22:22.551
- Stat page Anesthesia.
- No, I-I want a spinal.

22:22.567 --> 22:24.561
General anesthesia is quicker.

22:25.936 --> 22:27.932
I want to be awake, Luka.

22:27.945 --> 22:29.300
You're okay.

22:29.317 --> 22:30.900
You're going to be okay.

22:37.237 --> 22:38.721
No, we keep going.

22:38.738 --> 22:40.831
No, I want to sit
tight for a while.

22:40.847 --> 22:42.351
I don't think so.

22:42.366 --> 22:43.721
Babe, what do you think?
We split up?

22:43.756 --> 22:45.611
- Yeah.
- Not until we get another car!

22:45.628 --> 22:48.471
All you do is slow us down.
You and this dumb bitch...

22:48.485 --> 22:50.932
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Hey, hey! Take it easy.

22:50.947 --> 22:52.132
They're fighting.

22:52.148 --> 22:53.521
Yeah.

22:53.536 --> 22:55.251
They don't know what to do.

22:55.946 --> 22:59.551
They know they're in trouble,
the cops are coming for us.

23:00.208 --> 23:03.112
- Mom?
- Yeah?

23:03.126 --> 23:05.070
Is Dad gonna hurt us?

23:08.997 --> 23:11.543
Everything's going
to be okay, buddy.

23:13.277 --> 23:15.823
Keep your voice down.
They might hear you.

23:16.297 --> 23:18.340
Come here. Just come here.

23:30.416 --> 23:32.652
Hey, buddy,
I need you to help me do something,

23:32.666 --> 23:35.801
but you got to do it so
no one else knows, okay?

23:35.866 --> 23:37.213
Okay.

23:37.527 --> 23:38.863
Come on.

23:41.286 --> 23:42.731
Can you help me?

23:42.748 --> 23:44.612
Find some keys, ok?

23:44.626 --> 23:45.963
I think the other
guy has the keys.

23:45.995 --> 23:47.110
Or a gun or something.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.611
- A gun?
- Anything.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.560
Mom, I'm scared.

23:50.725 --> 23:53.842
Okay, I know you're scared,
and I know I messed up a lot,

23:53.858 --> 23:58.101
but I would never, ever let
anybody hurt you no matter what.

23:58.116 --> 24:00.131
I swear to God.

24:02.355 --> 24:04.231
Go! Go!

24:14.277 --> 24:15.970
Hey.

24:16.587 --> 24:18.562
You guys hungry?

24:26.746 --> 24:28.201
What's up, Frank?

24:31.606 --> 24:34.010
You know,
I always believed that...

24:34.397 --> 24:36.932
nothing'd ever really change.

24:39.148 --> 24:42.491
I'm old enough that I know

24:42.507 --> 24:44.671
that there's always
going to be trouble:

24:44.727 --> 24:46.961
war, taxes.

24:46.976 --> 24:51.122
Bad guys now are pretty much the
same as bad guys have always been.

24:53.878 --> 24:56.202
That's not how I feel today.

24:56.758 --> 24:59.411
I feel like the
world's getting worse

24:59.427 --> 25:01.741
and worse and worse,

25:01.755 --> 25:06.971
and what we're watching is the slow,
steady descent of the human race.

25:12.955 --> 25:16.390
No, no, I don't buy that.

25:17.578 --> 25:21.860
I think that, uh, today was just
a rough day for the home team.

25:56.547 --> 25:58.130
Straight across the sternum?

25:58.145 --> 25:59.510
Exactly.

26:03.965 --> 26:05.453
Ten blade.

26:14.335 --> 26:16.272
Lap pads. Oh, boy.

26:16.287 --> 26:18.460
- What?
- Lots of oozing.

26:26.058 --> 26:27.962
Cross-clamping the aorta.

26:27.978 --> 26:29.321
Cardioplegia going in.

26:29.337 --> 26:30.623
Ice.

26:34.446 --> 26:36.450
Opening the uterus.

26:37.126 --> 26:39.340
Hang two units of packed cells.

26:51.848 --> 26:54.572
Greater saphenous is isolated.

26:54.586 --> 26:57.913
Cannulate, check for leaks,
then pass it up.

27:11.777 --> 27:13.223
Bandage scissors.

27:19.206 --> 27:20.843
Cord is cut.

27:24.685 --> 27:27.072
Come on, little guy,
give me a cry.

27:34.885 --> 27:37.190
- Pulse is less than 60.
- Let's bag him.

27:37.205 --> 27:39.111
Intubation tray, 3-0 E.T. tube.

27:39.128 --> 27:40.733
Add 20 units Pit to the bag.

27:40.745 --> 27:42.671
Draw up methergine
and hemabate.

27:44.525 --> 27:46.613
- 20 Joules.
- Charged.

27:48.767 --> 27:50.042
Clear.

27:58.586 --> 28:00.102
Sinus rhythm.

28:00.878 --> 28:02.270
We have a pulse.

28:02.287 --> 28:04.603
- All right, Neela!
- That's our girl.

28:04.618 --> 28:07.432
Hole punch for the proximal.
5-0 proline.

28:08.518 --> 28:10.521
I'm in. Ambu bag.

28:13.986 --> 28:15.720
Abruption clot.

28:15.738 --> 28:17.910
Consumed all of your
clotting factors.

28:18.968 --> 28:22.341
Uterus is not responding to massage.
Let's pack it off.

28:27.845 --> 28:30.293
Draw up epi .03.

28:36.118 --> 28:37.582
Holding compressions.

28:37.597 --> 28:38.800
Pulse up to 120.

28:38.816 --> 28:40.551
Get ready to move.

28:41.066 --> 28:42.400
Damn it!

28:42.415 --> 28:43.393
What?

28:43.407 --> 28:45.151
The uterus is boggy
and hemorrhagic.

28:45.168 --> 28:47.461
The sutures are making it worse,
not better.

28:47.917 --> 28:50.690
Nothing after 20 minutes.
She's not clotting at all.

28:50.706 --> 28:52.173
Am I in DIC?

28:52.185 --> 28:54.802
Well, the FFP should reverse
it now that the baby's out.

28:54.817 --> 28:55.831
What if it doesn't?

28:55.846 --> 28:57.593
Pressure's down to 80/50.

28:57.607 --> 29:00.330
Two more units.
We got to control this bleeding.

29:00.727 --> 29:02.920
- Go to the NICU.
- No, I'm staying with you.

29:02.938 --> 29:04.093
No, I want you to
stay with the baby.

29:04.125 --> 29:05.703
- Abby...
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

29:05.715 --> 29:08.721
Please, just shut up!
I want you to stay with the baby!

29:13.165 --> 29:15.131
I'll try to ligate
the uterine arteries.

29:15.148 --> 29:17.172
Go. I will call you if
you need to be here.

29:17.188 --> 29:19.183
I don't want him to be alone.

30:02.477 --> 30:04.023
This'll help.

30:11.048 --> 30:12.822
You see that one up there?

30:13.048 --> 30:15.022
That real bright one?

30:16.138 --> 30:17.573
Dead.

30:18.068 --> 30:20.723
By the time we see it,
it's already gone.

30:24.716 --> 30:28.252
We'll get him his insulin way
before he needs it. He'll be fine.

30:31.648 --> 30:33.563
You know, Steve, I was...

30:34.477 --> 30:38.323
going to ask you what
happened to you...

30:39.056 --> 30:41.480
to turn you into this.

30:45.656 --> 30:47.820
But then I realized...

30:49.188 --> 30:54.090
it was always in the cards from
the moment that I met you.

30:56.377 --> 31:00.430
You were on your way to becoming
exactly what you are right now.

31:05.265 --> 31:06.890
I love him.

31:08.996 --> 31:11.181
I know you don't believe that,

31:11.196 --> 31:13.932
especially right now...

31:14.845 --> 31:16.560
but I do.

31:16.577 --> 31:18.893
Yeah, you love him, right.

31:20.185 --> 31:23.840
That's why you get some woman
to snatch him from school

31:24.986 --> 31:28.452
and tie him up and
leave him in a van.

31:32.417 --> 31:34.601
You don't even
remember his medicine.

31:34.617 --> 31:36.362
Hey, hey.

31:37.398 --> 31:39.470
You're right to be pissed.

31:39.485 --> 31:43.511
You're right, it was my fault.

31:43.766 --> 31:47.712
It was my fault for ever letting us
get separated in the first place.

31:50.825 --> 31:53.393
But now we got to
stay together.

31:53.407 --> 31:55.221
The three of us.

31:56.246 --> 31:58.563
There's no other way.

32:01.358 --> 32:03.612
I'd rather we were all dead.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.510
Hey...

32:14.967 --> 32:17.393
I don't want you to
be afraid of me.

32:24.128 --> 32:26.701
You don't need to be
afraid of me anymore.

32:41.798 --> 32:43.901
As long as we stay together,

32:43.915 --> 32:45.882
you and Alex are safe.

33:08.806 --> 33:10.793
Where are we in
factor replacement?

33:10.986 --> 33:14.981
Four of red cells, two units FFP,
pack of platelets.

33:15.697 --> 33:17.970
You've had
uterotonics, packing,

33:17.986 --> 33:20.292
an O'Leary stitch
and a B-lynch brace.

33:20.415 --> 33:21.801
Still bleeding?

33:21.818 --> 33:23.910
The blood has penetrated the
thickness of the uterine wall.

33:23.947 --> 33:25.752
I don't know what else to do.

33:26.397 --> 33:28.920
We can keep waiting
for you to clot,

33:29.287 --> 33:32.313
or we can start thinking
about a hysterectomy.

33:40.635 --> 33:42.120
How long can we wait?

33:42.135 --> 33:45.111
Too many transfusions will
put you back into DIC,

33:45.127 --> 33:47.143
and then the bleeding
gets even worse.

33:50.178 --> 33:52.481
Last crit is 21.

33:52.567 --> 33:54.673
Stay ahead two units.

34:06.986 --> 34:09.621
Uh... Jerry is in Recovery.

34:09.636 --> 34:11.411
I thought you
would want to know.

34:13.746 --> 34:17.342
Um... Have we heard
anything about Sam?

34:17.556 --> 34:19.002
No.

34:22.335 --> 34:24.739
This is a scary place. I...

34:24.998 --> 34:27.973
I remember the feeling
just walking in.

34:30.525 --> 34:34.253
I know your baby is a lot
sicker than Henry was,

34:34.266 --> 34:37.130
but everything turned out
okay for my boy, Luka,

34:37.148 --> 34:40.772
and I know that it
will for yours, too.

34:42.848 --> 34:47.551
Uh... they're concerned
about prolonged hypotension,

34:47.565 --> 34:52.261
and, uh... he is on, uh...
100% oxygen,

34:52.277 --> 34:56.739
so there's, uh...
there's a risk of toxicity. And...

35:08.727 --> 35:12.582
They're... they're going to...
to, uh...

35:13.095 --> 35:16.541
do periodic ultrasounds

35:16.557 --> 35:19.481
to check for
intraventricular hemorrhage.

35:20.617 --> 35:23.832
There's nothing more you
can do for him right now.

35:24.336 --> 35:26.671
You should go be with Abby.

35:28.585 --> 35:30.950
She doesn't want
him to be alone.

35:32.167 --> 35:34.052
He won't be.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.831
Okay, so Morris got
you through the E.R.

35:44.845 --> 35:46.282
The first circle of hell.

35:46.298 --> 35:47.712
And Neela got you
through surgery.

35:47.725 --> 35:49.392
The second.

35:50.045 --> 35:53.193
I guess it's up to me to
get myself through recovery.

35:53.207 --> 35:54.833
Yeah, those are circles
three through nine.

35:54.865 --> 35:58.160
Well, here's one way to start--
the incentive spirometer.

35:58.178 --> 35:59.613
It'll keep you from
getting pneumonia.

35:59.648 --> 36:02.950
You suck on it to make the
Ping-Pong balls rise twice an hour.

36:03.017 --> 36:04.950
Do you know what time it is?

36:04.965 --> 36:10.252
I've been out there, watching the
same cable news over and over.

36:10.267 --> 36:11.151
Hey, Ma.

36:11.165 --> 36:14.051
I missed my water aerobics.
You were supposed to take me.

36:14.067 --> 36:16.462
I know, I know.

36:19.317 --> 36:23.282
Oy vey,
you gave me such a scare,

36:23.297 --> 36:25.671
my shaina boychik.

36:26.526 --> 36:30.062
I'm sorry, Ma. I'm sorry.

36:30.075 --> 36:32.401
Oh, look at that.
Look at that punim.

36:34.717 --> 36:36.542
I'm... I'm...

36:44.715 --> 36:45.781
Hey.

36:46.008 --> 36:47.322
Hey.

36:50.617 --> 36:51.973
How's he doing?

36:51.986 --> 36:53.463
He's fine.

36:53.826 --> 36:55.423
Still intubated?

36:55.756 --> 36:59.432
Yeah, but he's satting well,
you know?

36:59.447 --> 37:01.852
Pressure's holding
with dopamine.

37:01.868 --> 37:03.402
He's making urine.

37:03.417 --> 37:04.672
Brain scan?

37:04.687 --> 37:06.263
Clear.

37:08.015 --> 37:09.753
Well, those are
all good things.

37:09.766 --> 37:12.062
Yeah. All good things.

37:17.656 --> 37:19.961
Is one going to be enough?

37:19.976 --> 37:21.470
What?

37:21.487 --> 37:23.481
One baby.

37:26.147 --> 37:30.233
Um... My uterus
wouldn't stop bleeding,

37:30.246 --> 37:33.323
and Coburn did everything 
she could, but, um...

37:40.838 --> 37:43.022
You had a hysterectomy?

37:51.188 --> 37:53.520
Well, one's all we need.

38:02.985 --> 38:06.692
So, um... I'm not going to be
able to see him for a while.

38:06.707 --> 38:09.732
I can't get to the NICU
for at least 24 hours.

38:09.846 --> 38:11.983
You don't have to
wait that long.

38:23.965 --> 38:27.220
That's what I told him.
To wave to Mom.

38:28.257 --> 38:30.750
Yeah, he's a smart one.

38:37.956 --> 38:40.712
- Joseph.
- Hmm?

38:41.768 --> 38:44.620
I don't remember much 
about my dad, but, uh...

38:46.546 --> 38:50.580
I remember when I was little,
he used to love to watch boxing.

38:51.825 --> 38:54.083
And especially Joe Frazier,
because he thought

38:54.095 --> 38:56.801
he was the best
pure fighter, so...

39:06.395 --> 39:08.802
I'd like to call him Joe,

39:09.325 --> 39:11.093
if that's okay.

39:23.428 --> 39:25.773
I'll be right back.
Do you need anything?

41:02.135 --> 41:03.340
Steve?

41:05.546 --> 41:06.970
Steve?

41:14.347 --> 41:16.191
Steve, I have to pee.

42:40.746 --> 42:46.141
