00:00.917 --> 00:02.502
Previously on Prison Break:

00:02.585 --> 00:03.795
When I sent you those envelopes,

00:03.878 --> 00:05.588
I wasn't just playing games.

00:05.672 --> 00:06.673
Move on subject four.

00:06.756 --> 00:08.717
My wife is a defenseless woman.
Execute the order.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.469
Please don't do that!

00:13.888 --> 00:15.390
Don't call anyone.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.476
You wanted to get in
on the action,

00:18.560 --> 00:19.644
here's your chance.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.026
Three-quarters
of a billion dollars

00:26.860 --> 00:28.528
in a numerical account
in Luxembourg.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.823
All the data will be delivered
within twenty four hours.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.366
Case.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.076
I'll take that.

00:35.910 --> 00:36.953
Hi, Mom.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.705
I know you have it.

00:38.788 --> 00:39.998
Bring me Scylla

00:40.081 --> 00:43.126
or this time Sara's death
will not be faked.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.003
Linc!

00:45.086 --> 00:46.379
Looks like you have
a little decision to make:

00:47.213 --> 00:48.298
Scylla...

00:48.381 --> 00:49.716
or someone you love.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.266
Just think this
through, Michael.

00:58.349 --> 01:00.435
I have, and we're
saving them both.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.686
How?

01:01.770 --> 01:03.188
I will figure it out.

01:03.271 --> 01:04.606
Your brother's
bleeding to death.

01:04.689 --> 01:05.732
I wonder if we
can get them

01:05.815 --> 01:07.567
to bring Linc and Sara
to the same place.

01:07.650 --> 01:08.943
So right now,
your only advantage

01:09.027 --> 01:12.113
is that neither party knows
that there's another player

01:12.197 --> 01:13.490
that has leverage on you.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.575
You bring them both together,
you lose your tactical edge.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.118
I'm not abandoning Sara.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.328
I didn't say to do that.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.121
What I am saying
is that Sara has the advantage

01:20.205 --> 01:21.831
of not having a bullet
in her chest.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.461
One at a time.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.675
Big surprise.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.429
The dumb one got caught,
the smart one got away.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.848
I'm beginning
to see a pattern here.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.433
He's never gonna
give it to you.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.353
Hmm, I disagree.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.313
He truly cares for you.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.856
No matter
how many times

01:46.940 --> 01:48.900
you've shown you
don't deserve it.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.612
You know, you two
are truly a classic study

01:52.695 --> 01:54.614
of nature versus nurture.

01:54.697 --> 01:57.992
Same environment,
same parents...

01:58.076 --> 02:00.120
you're completely different.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.455
Why do you think that is,
Lincoln?

02:02.539 --> 02:05.041
Because Mom's
a psychotic bitch.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.215
Hello, Michael.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.424
All right, you win.

02:13.508 --> 02:14.634
I'll give you Scylla.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.427
Just give Linc
whatever help he needs.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.054
Not until I get what I need.

02:18.138 --> 02:22.308
Edison Shipping Yard,
B Dock, forty five minutes.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.768
And bring my brother.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.229
Forty five minutes?
Cutting it close.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.022
He doesn't
look so good.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.149
Just be there.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.985
Is is worth it, Sara?

02:33.778 --> 02:36.573
Do you ever go back
to that night

02:36.656 --> 02:39.325
and wonder how things
would have gone

02:39.409 --> 02:42.662
if you had just left
that infirmary door

02:43.413 --> 02:44.914
locked?

02:44.998 --> 02:47.083
All the people whose lives
would have been saved.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.334
Hell, your father

02:48.418 --> 02:50.253
would still be alive.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.796
You ever think about that?

02:53.506 --> 02:56.426
And now that Michael's
returning Scylla to me,

02:56.509 --> 02:59.053
it was all for nothing.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.847
Assuming he does return it.

03:01.431 --> 03:05.185
If the situation were reversed,
if Michael were here

03:05.268 --> 03:07.061
and you were
holding Scylla,

03:07.145 --> 03:08.688
what would you do?

03:10.398 --> 03:11.774
You'd bring it back

03:11.858 --> 03:14.319
for the same reason
you left that door unlocked,

03:14.402 --> 03:15.528
because you

03:15.612 --> 03:18.656
couldn't let
an innocent man die.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.284
Your heart betrays
your better judgment.

03:21.367 --> 03:22.702
So does Scofield's.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.788
You know, you're
probably right.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.790
Because if Michael had used
his better judgment

03:27.874 --> 03:30.793
the night he stole Scylla
out from under your nose,

03:31.586 --> 03:32.879
he would have killed you.

03:35.548 --> 03:36.966
Get her out of my sight.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.814
Take it.

04:00.615 --> 04:04.077
Either take my pocket
or I take yours.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.289
Understand?

04:08.373 --> 04:10.541
The authorities are blanketing the streets

04:10.625 --> 04:12.460
looking for
the primary suspects,

04:12.543 --> 04:14.963
Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.172
The brothers, famous for one

04:16.256 --> 04:19.092
of the most daring
prison breaks in recent history,

04:19.175 --> 04:20.218
are considered armed and--

04:27.433 --> 04:28.518
Homemade explosives?

04:28.601 --> 04:29.811
You got a better idea?

04:29.894 --> 04:32.355
Maybe the best way
to save Linc...

04:32.438 --> 04:34.482
to save everyone...

04:34.565 --> 04:36.150
is give Christina what
she wants.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.154
I'm just trying to find a way
where the people that we love

04:40.238 --> 04:42.031
don't end up
on an autopsy table.

04:42.115 --> 04:42.991
And I'm not?

04:44.450 --> 04:46.202
Better get your
story straight, Alex.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.537
This whole time
you've been saying

04:47.620 --> 04:48.830
we should give Scylla
back to the General.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.623
What, you didn't hear
what he did to Self's wife?

04:50.707 --> 04:51.874
Self made his own bed.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.501
Yeah, and we're
sleeping in it.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.964
Let's say,
best-case scenario, okay,

04:58.047 --> 05:00.466
that maybe somehow we're able
to get to Linc and Sara.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.634
Okay, what then?

05:01.718 --> 05:03.136
General's still got somebody

05:03.219 --> 05:04.178
watching my wife.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.014
What's the plan
to keep her safe?

05:06.097 --> 05:07.140
What about LJ?

05:07.223 --> 05:08.433
What's the plan
to keep him safe?

05:08.516 --> 05:09.892
I can't think about
that right now.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.769
Maybe we go to your mother
and try to make a deal.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.896
I mean, there's no love lost
between her and the General.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.899
With her contacts,
if we give her Scylla,

05:16.983 --> 05:18.693
maybe she can find out
where the agents...

05:18.776 --> 05:20.987
We're not giving up
and we're not giving it back!

05:21.070 --> 05:22.822
We're gonna save everyone!

06:13.331 --> 06:14.791
What the hell
are you doing here?

06:15.291 --> 06:16.876
What am I doing here?

06:18.211 --> 06:19.837
You're in Recovery,
Mr. Self.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.839
Apparently, you
had quite a fall.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.175
Luckily, someone found
you and called 911.

06:24.258 --> 06:25.551
They did what?

06:25.635 --> 06:27.678
The doctor will be in shortly
to go over your history.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.679
No, no, no, no.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.808
Tell the doctor
to go see the next guy.

06:31.891 --> 06:32.892
I'm going.

06:32.975 --> 06:33.976
Actually, I can't.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.812
There's some men here

06:35.895 --> 06:36.979
waiting to
talk to you.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.064
What kind of men?

06:38.147 --> 06:39.899
The kind with badges.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.069
Mr. Self, my name
is Agent Chris Franco.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.655
This is Agent Wilson Wright.
We're with the Bureau.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.740
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

06:47.824 --> 06:48.950
About what?

06:49.033 --> 06:51.160
Let's start with where we
can find Lincoln Burrows

06:51.244 --> 06:52.620
and Michael Scofield.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.432
Be ready to pick us up.

07:13.933 --> 07:17.353
Better not get too close
to that thing when it goes off.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.439
And you'd better
not get too far.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.409
All right, if Michael
tries anything,

07:31.492 --> 07:32.869
take out both knees.

07:32.952 --> 07:33.870
I don't want him dead,

07:33.953 --> 07:37.540
I just want him immobilized
and eager to talk.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.959
And what do you want
to do with Burrows?

07:41.544 --> 07:44.797
Once I get Scylla,
dump him off the dock.

07:46.340 --> 07:50.052
Yeah, one of them guys
from the news,

07:50.136 --> 07:52.472
I think I just seen him.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.892
Interesting choice.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.894
I would have thought
you'd picked something

07:57.977 --> 08:00.605
a little more public
for your own protection.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.398
Something a little
more public

08:02.482 --> 08:05.151
isn't safe for me
right now, thanks to you.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.196
Did you come alone?

08:08.279 --> 08:09.489
Did you?

08:12.116 --> 08:13.159
Come on.

08:13.242 --> 08:16.662
We can have at least one
honest conversation, can't we?

08:18.247 --> 08:20.041
Actually, I'd like that.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.168
In spite of what you think,

08:22.251 --> 08:23.836
I never wanted
to see you get hurt.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.421
What did you want?

08:26.464 --> 08:28.049
Understanding...

08:29.050 --> 08:30.760
forgiveness.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.845
But when I made my choice,
I knew I'd never have

08:32.929 --> 08:34.430
any of those things.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.099
But you will have power,
won't you?

08:37.183 --> 08:39.477
Yes, and you'll
have Lincoln.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.396
Quite honestly, I think you're getting
the short end of the stick.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.606
Speaking of which,
I need to get him

08:43.689 --> 08:45.733
to a hospital,
so where is he?

08:45.816 --> 08:46.901
Where is Scylla?

08:46.984 --> 08:48.110
I need to know he's alive.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.164
Satisfied?

09:02.291 --> 09:03.543
Follow me.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.882
Now, you wouldn't have some
little trick up your sleeve,

09:09.966 --> 09:11.634
would you, son?

09:11.717 --> 09:13.886
I'm done playing games
with you.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.934
Good. Then bring
Scylla out to me.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.728
If I bring Scylla out in the
open, your man will shoot me.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.564
Well, then I guess
we have a standoff.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.899
The only thing is,
what I want

09:26.983 --> 09:27.984
isn't gasping
for air

09:28.067 --> 09:30.820
and losing a pint of blood
every ten minutes.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.488
Give it to me, Michael.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.490
You know I can't do that.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.450
Give it to me, Michael.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.077
You're running out
of options, son.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.328
I said no.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.580
This is the Miami Police!

09:40.663 --> 09:41.872
Give it to me, Michael!

09:41.956 --> 09:42.915
Christina, we gotta go!

09:42.999 --> 09:44.417
Put down your weapons
and put your hands up.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.334
Come and get it.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.669
Go get it.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.088
Put down your weapons.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.516
Son of a...

10:01.976 --> 10:02.977
Come on, come on,
Michael.

10:07.648 --> 10:08.899
Michael, we gotta go now!

10:09.734 --> 10:10.735
Now!

10:45.603 --> 10:47.938
So the government helped you out?

10:48.022 --> 10:49.106
After all we've been through,

10:49.190 --> 10:50.608
you know how crazy
that sounds, huh?

10:50.691 --> 10:52.109
Well, the proof
is there.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.070
Every morning I wake up
my little girl,

10:54.153 --> 10:57.031
and she's healthy again, man.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.200
Yeah. Where are you living?

10:59.283 --> 11:02.286
Actually, uh, that's why
I came down here to talk to you.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.205
You know, uh...

11:06.207 --> 11:08.501
We were in protective custody

11:08.584 --> 11:11.379
while I was waiting to testify
against Mahone,

11:11.462 --> 11:13.339
but his case fell through.

11:13.422 --> 11:17.218
Anyway they wanted to not
only renege on my deal,

11:17.301 --> 11:19.637
they wanted to put my ass
back in Fox River.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.306
So, what are you doing here
in Chicago following me?

11:24.558 --> 11:26.811
I was wondering if you, uh,

11:26.894 --> 11:30.147
had any idea of where Michael
and Linc were.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.445
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa,
where you going?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.239
Look, you in a bind
with the feds,

11:38.322 --> 11:40.658
and now you want to know
about Mike and Linc?

11:40.741 --> 11:42.535
-Come on, come on...
-What, you gonna bust me, too?

11:42.618 --> 11:45.621
No, I am trying
to help you, man.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.164
And them.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.167
Okay, man, don't you
watch the news, Sucre?

11:50.251 --> 11:52.128
They are in
a lot of trouble.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.921
Big time.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.715
And the only way
they can get out of it

11:55.798 --> 11:58.175
is if you help me find them.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.638
We're just trying
to find the two men

12:02.722 --> 12:03.931
behind this assassination.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.142
Well, obviously your clearance
level isn't high enough

12:06.225 --> 12:07.768
for you to fully grasp

12:07.852 --> 12:09.478
the operation
that I've been involved with.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.188
All right, then
how about we tell you

12:11.272 --> 12:12.732
what we've grasped so far?

12:12.815 --> 12:15.401
The dead body of your partner,
Agent Miriam Holtz

12:15.484 --> 12:17.278
autopsy shows the bullet
she was shot with

12:17.361 --> 12:19.697
-was fired from an agency-issued firearm.
-Right.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.491
The disappearance of your direct supervisor
at Homeland, a Mr. Herb Stanton.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.576
Okay.
We also got a number

12:23.659 --> 12:25.244
of DHS transportation officers

12:25.327 --> 12:26.579
with interesting information

12:26.662 --> 12:29.039
concerning a warehouse
back in Los Angeles

12:29.123 --> 12:30.750
that you were conducting some
kind of secret operation out of.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.419
So, when an international
political figure

12:33.502 --> 12:35.379
is assassinated
on American soil

12:35.463 --> 12:38.340
by two men taken into custody
by a Homeland Security agent,

12:38.424 --> 12:40.676
who by all appearances
has gone rogue,

12:40.760 --> 12:43.053
you tell us what we're supposed
to think is going on.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.931
What's going on is, you're
talking to a federal agent

12:46.015 --> 12:47.850
like I'm an accomplice
to a crime

12:47.933 --> 12:49.393
that I had
nothing to do with.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.561
Do you have any idea

12:50.644 --> 12:51.937
how many years I've served
my country?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.147
Do you have
any idea to the extent

12:53.230 --> 12:56.233
that I've served my...?
What is this, Gitmo now?

12:56.817 --> 12:58.486
As a Homeland agent,

12:58.569 --> 13:01.781
you are aware, I'm sure,
that anyone who impedes

13:01.864 --> 13:03.991
an investigation
into an act of terrorism

13:04.074 --> 13:05.326
has virtually no protection
under the law.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.662
Okay! Okay!

13:09.830 --> 13:10.956
Okay.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.209
Now...

13:13.292 --> 13:15.795
where are Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows?

13:15.878 --> 13:17.379
I don't know where they are.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.380
Okay?

13:19.173 --> 13:20.966
But, but I could find out.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.845
Well, Michael clearly
cares more about winning

13:24.929 --> 13:28.224
than he does about
saving your life.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.643
Looks like you're not going
to live long enough to be an uncle.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.938
What? What?

13:34.021 --> 13:35.981
Well, Sara hasn't
told anybody.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.693
Christina, Banerjee's
on the phone.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.695
He wants to know why he hasn't
received the technology.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.074
If Michael doesn't call

13:45.157 --> 13:47.076
in the next ten minutes,
you're gonna wish

13:47.159 --> 13:49.578
he'd let you fry
back at Fox River.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.505
Hello.

13:59.588 --> 14:00.965
I thought we had an understanding.

14:01.048 --> 14:04.093
I thought I made the stakes
crystal clear.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.136
You did, and I'm trying.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.305
And I'm trying not
to kill Sara,

14:08.389 --> 14:10.182
but that would be a lot easier
if I had something

14:10.266 --> 14:12.101
in this hand
besides a gun.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.478
Look, every cop and fed
in this city is looking for me.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.647
The last thing I want to do
is jeopardize her life

14:16.730 --> 14:17.940
by getting arrested and having

14:18.023 --> 14:20.442
the very thing you want
locked up as evidence.

14:20.526 --> 14:24.738
Well, I appreciate you taking
care of my interests, Michael.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.115
I do.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.033
And believe me, for that reason

14:28.117 --> 14:29.451
I will take care
of your interests,

14:29.535 --> 14:32.288
but if I don't see Scylla
in one hour

14:32.371 --> 14:35.624
I'm unleashing Bagwell to play
doctor with the doctor.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.792
Am I clear?!

14:36.876 --> 14:38.377
I need more time.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.087
One hour!

14:42.673 --> 14:45.050
Doesn't Michael understand?

14:45.134 --> 14:47.219
He's playing chicken
with other people's lives here.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.929
My life's been
threatened before.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.973
I'm not talking about yours.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.683
That boy has messed up

14:52.766 --> 14:54.935
every chance I've ever had
at freedom.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.478
This is my last shot.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.064
You really think when this is over
you're going to be free?

14:59.148 --> 15:01.525
Better than free.
I'm going to be employed.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.777
The General's getting me
an honest-to-goodness job

15:03.861 --> 15:04.987
with an office
and a desk.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.822
What kind of a job
is he going to get you, huh?

15:06.906 --> 15:09.450
What's he going
to trust you with?

15:09.533 --> 15:12.036
The General hires professional
killers, not amateurs.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.788
Not uneducated criminals
who rape and kill.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.916
You mind your tongue,
little lady.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.334
The only thing you're getting
when this is over

15:18.417 --> 15:20.586
is a slit throat
and an unmarked grave.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.213
Actually,

15:23.297 --> 15:25.925
your only chance at a life
is to get out of here.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.304
And if you take
me with you,

15:30.387 --> 15:32.640
whatever's happened
between you and Michael,

15:32.723 --> 15:34.099
if you get me back to him,

15:35.142 --> 15:37.102
the slate could
be wiped clean.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.772
With Michael and me...

15:39.855 --> 15:41.857
that slate's never going
to be clean.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.610
And if he doesn't give
the General what he wants...

15:46.320 --> 15:49.448
it's going to get
a hell of a lot dirtier.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.039
What are you doing?

15:57.122 --> 15:58.624
I need to make
sure Linc's okay.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.380
I suppose that little explosion
was meant for me.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.298
Let's pretend
that was for the cops.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.467
Please, Michael, stop.

16:08.550 --> 16:09.969
You're embarrassing yourself.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.763
You should know by now that
you can't outthink me.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.556
I'll always be one step
ahead of you

16:14.640 --> 16:16.684
because I'm your mother.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.143
Is Linc okay?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.144
Hmm.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.647
I remember the
first time

16:21.730 --> 16:23.065
I caught you in a lie.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.610
I could see it in your eyes,
just like I could see it today.

16:26.694 --> 16:27.903
Put him on the phone.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.572
You're not in a position
to be making demands, son.

16:30.656 --> 16:31.699
Actually, if Linc is dead,

16:31.782 --> 16:33.075
I have no reason
to give you Scylla,

16:33.158 --> 16:36.078
which puts me in exactly
the position you describe.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.258
Yeah.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.593
Hey, it's nice to know
you're still breathing.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.012
How much time do I have?

16:53.554 --> 16:54.555
Not much.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.681
The General has Sara.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.641
He's giving me an hour
to exchange her for Scylla.

16:57.725 --> 16:58.767
I need to know where you are,

16:58.851 --> 17:00.686
so if you can give me
any kind of signal.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.354
Don't know.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.606
Look, if I'm going to save you both,
I need something, anything!

17:04.690 --> 17:05.733
Banerjee again.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.735
There's just not enough time,
Michael.

17:07.818 --> 17:08.652
I can do this, Linc.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.112
I can do this.

17:10.195 --> 17:13.073
There's something
you need to know.

17:14.283 --> 17:17.453
Sara's p... Sara's pregnant.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.541
It's... it's okay.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.001
You're going to be a dad.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.962
No, I understand.
Now, if you just give us a little more time...

17:27.046 --> 17:28.547
Go to her, Michael.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.592
I'll find a way, Linc.

17:31.675 --> 17:32.801
There's not enough time.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.012
There's just not enough time.

17:35.095 --> 17:37.306
Let me go out, knowing
that I did something for you.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.058
Give me that!

17:39.725 --> 17:41.060
Linc?

18:00.370 --> 18:02.456
I'm sorry about what's ever
happening to Linc.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.374
And I know you have to
protect your family,

18:04.458 --> 18:05.626
I understand that,

18:05.709 --> 18:07.169
but, Michael, what are we going
to do about the rest of us?

18:07.252 --> 18:08.504
What are we going to do
about my wife?

18:08.587 --> 18:13.008
Alex, I don't...

18:13.092 --> 18:15.469
I don't know
what you want me to say.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.638
You haven't gone a day
in your life without a plan.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.098
Please don't start now.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.936
All I know is

18:24.019 --> 18:26.105
I have forty three minutes
to get this

18:26.772 --> 18:28.524
to the General.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.275
I am done making plans.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.403
And to hell
with everybody else.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.491
Well...

18:37.574 --> 18:40.494
maybe it's time I take a
page from your book, Alex.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.371
Hang out on
the sidelines,

18:42.454 --> 18:43.872
survey the field.

18:43.956 --> 18:47.918
When the time is right,
back the winning horse.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.422
That's what you
think I'm about?

18:52.506 --> 18:56.385
Tell me something, Alex,
which horse are you backing now?

18:56.468 --> 18:58.470
Because I'm not quite clear
on that.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.191
At least you got a decision.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.320
They took my son.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.073
I didn't
get to choose.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.492
Ah, man.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.164
I'm just trying to do
whatever it takes to...

19:26.165 --> 19:28.000
to not lose everything.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.586
So am I.

19:32.713 --> 19:36.842
So if there's something
you need to do to protect Pam,

19:36.925 --> 19:38.218
you should do it.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.109
Do you realize
after what you pulled,

19:54.193 --> 19:57.029
you're completely
worthless to me now?

19:58.322 --> 20:01.283
You've been worthless
to me all your life.

20:05.287 --> 20:08.165
I know you and Michael think
I was a terrible mother.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.959
Couldn't agree with you more.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.086
I warned Aldo.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.839
I told him
I was not cut out for it.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.925
It is not in my nature!

20:22.763 --> 20:25.390
He used to call me
his Lady Macbeth.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.727
I knew there was a reason
I hated Shakespeare.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.812
You hated it

20:30.896 --> 20:34.024
because you couldn't
understand it.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.027
You couldn't understand
it because...

20:38.153 --> 20:41.990
your real mother was as dumb
as a day-old doughnut.

20:42.824 --> 20:44.660
You asked me

20:44.743 --> 20:47.621
how I could just sit
and watch my son

20:47.704 --> 20:49.039
go into the chair.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.168
The answer's simple really.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.130
You're not my son.

21:00.175 --> 21:02.427
Michael already knows.

21:02.511 --> 21:06.556
That must be why it's so easy
for him to play with your life.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.851
I guess we have that in common.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.896
Now, go find my son.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.899
Your information leads to an arrest,

21:15.983 --> 21:17.526
we'll make sure the courts
can't touch you.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.069
Right. Well, you
put that in writing

21:19.152 --> 21:20.404
and then we're in business.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.197
No, no, the only thing you get
to demand in writing

21:22.281 --> 21:23.490
is what we put
on your tombstone.

21:23.573 --> 21:25.242
The last thing you're going
to want to find out about

21:25.325 --> 21:26.576
is the brothers killing
somebody else

21:26.952 --> 21:28.412
while you're
in here harassing

21:28.495 --> 21:29.621
your only source
of intel.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.164
It needs to be
in writing,

21:31.707 --> 21:33.208
and signed
by the attorney general.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.044
I don't trust anyone who says
they work for the government.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.172
All you have to do...

21:40.841 --> 21:42.509
is call the brothers.

21:42.592 --> 21:45.137
Get them on the phone,
let me talk to them.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.222
And then they can make up
their own minds, all right?

21:47.306 --> 21:50.309
I'm just trying
to stay out of all this.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.102
I finally got my family back,

21:52.185 --> 21:54.646
and I'm not about
to risk losing them again.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.899
I know this
feels good today.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.862
But what about
a couple months from now, huh?

22:01.945 --> 22:03.989
When the only job you can get
is under the table

22:04.072 --> 22:06.366
or some labor gig,
where every minute

22:06.450 --> 22:09.077
you'll be worrying about the guy
you're sweating next to,

22:09.161 --> 22:11.538
if he's gonna drop the dime
in a heartbeat

22:11.621 --> 22:12.873
because he recognizes you.

22:12.956 --> 22:15.500
How is finding Linc and Mike
gonna change any of that?

22:15.584 --> 22:18.545
This guy
sought me out, okay?

22:18.628 --> 22:20.505
He knows everything
about this whole thing.

22:20.589 --> 22:21.757
Well, is he government?

22:21.840 --> 22:22.966
'Cause if he's government,
I don't want...

22:23.050 --> 22:24.634
I didn't trust him
at first either!

22:24.718 --> 22:26.470
Okay? But it's
something about being in the pen

22:26.553 --> 22:30.807
where you start to decipher who
is a player and who is a punk.

22:31.475 --> 22:32.642
And this guy

22:32.726 --> 22:34.686
is a player.

22:34.770 --> 22:35.937
Just like Scofield.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.609
So the only thing
that we have to do

22:40.692 --> 22:42.486
is to tell him
where the brothers are,

22:42.569 --> 22:44.654
help him get
this device thing back,

22:44.738 --> 22:46.531
and-and so he can put it
into the right hands.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.367
And then what? Hmm?

22:48.450 --> 22:50.660
This brother has juice.

22:50.744 --> 22:53.914
He can erase
our entire record.

22:53.997 --> 22:57.042
Now, I'm not talking about cash
and all that flashy stuff.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.336
I'm just talking about
straight up freedom,

22:59.419 --> 23:01.254
living like a man.
You feel me?

23:05.217 --> 23:06.927
No, of course, Nandu.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.012
It... Yes, yes.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.640
We just ran into a few
technical difficulties, so...

23:11.723 --> 23:15.936
No, I understand. Now, if you just give us
a little more time, then, um...

23:16.019 --> 23:17.729
No, no, no. No, no, don't.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.147
No, please don't
get on the plane.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.108
No, I can...

23:31.368 --> 23:34.871
You just cost me three-quarters
of a billion dollars!

23:35.580 --> 23:36.915
Good.

23:36.998 --> 23:39.209
At least the day
wasn't a total waste.

23:39.292 --> 23:40.961
I was gonna wait
till I found Michael

23:41.044 --> 23:43.130
and just kill you
in front of him, but instead,

23:43.213 --> 23:44.464
I'm gonna take you out

23:44.548 --> 23:46.508
the same way
you came in - alone.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.515
You'd better be calling me
to tell me you've got Scylla.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.309
Whoever you've
sent after it is too late.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.561
Michael's giving Scylla back

23:57.644 --> 23:59.479
to the General
in exchange for Sara's life.

23:59.563 --> 24:00.689
Who the hell is this?

24:00.772 --> 24:01.773
Alex Mahone.
I don't believe

24:01.857 --> 24:03.650
we've had the pleasure
of meeting.

24:04.401 --> 24:05.444
Oh, yeah.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.862
Alex Mahone.

24:06.945 --> 24:08.864
You calling to rub
this in my face?

24:08.947 --> 24:11.116
Calling to see
if you'll make me an offer.

24:11.199 --> 24:12.826
I can get Scylla for you,

24:12.909 --> 24:15.579
if you promise to give me
what Michael can't.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.456
What's that?

24:17.539 --> 24:19.207
Protection for my family.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.334
If your people can get my wife
away from whoever

24:21.418 --> 24:24.463
the General's got watching her,
I'll get you Scylla.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.256
You can get me Scylla?

24:26.339 --> 24:27.632
Mahone...

24:27.716 --> 24:29.634
you son of a bitch.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.887
I've got no particular love
for Burrows.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.638
Sounds like
the feeling's mutual.

24:33.722 --> 24:34.723
Yeah, but unlike his brother,

24:34.806 --> 24:36.892
the guy's always been
straight with me.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.144
And he helped me track down
the guy who murdered my son,

24:39.227 --> 24:40.395
and for that, I owe him.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.855
And you don't owe Michael?

24:43.940 --> 24:45.025
Not any more.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.568
His choice, not mine.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.112
I'll tell you what.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.281
You give me Scylla,

24:52.324 --> 24:54.326
and if Lincoln's
still breathing,

24:54.409 --> 24:56.161
you can have him.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.246
I like that deal.

25:16.097 --> 25:17.557
Hickory dickory doc.

25:17.641 --> 25:21.770
Tell me, has Scofield
ever run up your clock?

25:21.853 --> 25:24.231
Has he been man enough
to go there?

25:24.314 --> 25:25.232
Or is he

25:25.315 --> 25:26.733
saving it up
for the wedding day?

25:26.816 --> 25:29.778
Michael is more man
than you can ever hope to be.

25:29.861 --> 25:33.198
How would you know what
a man is like, huh?

25:33.281 --> 25:36.159
Of the two of us, I bet
I've been with more of them.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.955
Look at you,
all buttoned up...

25:40.038 --> 25:41.790
frigid.

25:41.873 --> 25:45.794
Tell me, what does it take to
loosen up a gal like you, huh?

25:45.877 --> 25:47.796
Music?

25:47.879 --> 25:48.838
Flowers?

25:48.922 --> 25:50.924
Touch?

25:51.007 --> 25:52.300
Where the fingers

25:52.384 --> 25:54.427
do the walking down
to where only...

25:55.470 --> 25:56.846
Stop it!

25:58.348 --> 25:59.432
Please.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.850
My, my.

26:00.934 --> 26:03.186
I do like a woman
with manners.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.484
Michael, you'd better
be calling me

26:09.568 --> 26:10.610
to tell me you're close.

26:10.694 --> 26:11.820
We're almost there.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.947
Good. But I've changed my mind.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.532
The exchange will be made

26:15.615 --> 26:16.950
at a location of my choosing.

26:17.033 --> 26:19.494
Forgive me, but I don't
really trust you,

26:19.578 --> 26:21.371
except on unfamiliar territory.

26:21.454 --> 26:24.708
You bring Sara
unharmed, and...

26:25.375 --> 26:26.793
I'll meet you anywhere.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.921
Uh, there's an old
parking lot

26:30.005 --> 26:32.632
where Pelican Drive
meets the beach.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.134
Be there in twenty minutes.

26:34.217 --> 26:35.260
And I'm supposed to trust

26:35.343 --> 26:37.012
that you're just gonna let us
live our lives, huh?

26:37.095 --> 26:40.765
Believe it or not, Michael,
the last thing on Earth I want

26:40.849 --> 26:44.644
is to ever see you
or any member of your family again.

26:44.728 --> 26:47.063
You stay out of my way,
I'll stay out of yours.

26:47.897 --> 26:48.815
Bring me Scylla.

26:48.898 --> 26:50.317
Twenty minutes, Michael!

26:50.400 --> 26:51.359
All right.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.611
Twenty minutes!

26:57.365 --> 26:58.908
About earlier...

26:59.784 --> 27:02.203
I do think you're in it
for yourself.

27:02.287 --> 27:05.749
Fortunately for me,
that's meant you've also had my back...

27:06.875 --> 27:08.627
more than once.

27:10.086 --> 27:11.087
And for that,

27:12.672 --> 27:14.090
I'm grateful.

27:15.425 --> 27:16.509
Take the case.

27:16.593 --> 27:18.762
Get out of here.
What about Pam?

27:20.096 --> 27:21.514
I got it handled.

27:26.436 --> 27:27.896
Good luck.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.526
Looks like your boyfriend straightened
his priorities out.

27:33.610 --> 27:34.611
That's too bad.

27:34.694 --> 27:36.529
We were just starting
to get familiar.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.948
Teddy, what are you doing?

27:41.284 --> 27:43.411
You said we was gonna bring her
on the exchange.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.831
All I'm giving Scofield today
is a slow death.

27:48.458 --> 27:49.918
So what are we gonna do
with her?

27:50.001 --> 27:51.294
Whatever you like.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.296
Perhaps we've finally
found a job

27:53.380 --> 27:55.298
for which
you're perfectly suited.

28:20.323 --> 28:21.908
Mr. Mahone?

28:21.991 --> 28:22.992
I'm on my way.

28:24.494 --> 28:25.745
And Michael?

28:25.829 --> 28:27.122
I don't want
to talk about Michael.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.583
Well, it seems Michael did
a poor job choosing his friends.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.085
None of us chose this.

28:32.168 --> 28:33.002
This happened to us.

28:33.086 --> 28:34.754
The only thing we choose
is how it ends.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.965
So just get your people
in place to help my wife.

28:37.048 --> 28:38.174
How does that sound?

28:40.593 --> 28:42.429
One of our assets
with the Bureau

28:42.512 --> 28:45.223
says that two agents
are questioning Don Self

28:45.306 --> 28:46.641
at Miami Mission Hospital.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.935
And the attorney general
just issued a proclamation

28:49.018 --> 28:50.061
for his immunity.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.604
You think he's a threat?

28:52.772 --> 28:54.107
Perhaps.

28:54.190 --> 28:56.067
Question is, to whom?

29:05.368 --> 29:06.453
Hello?

29:06.536 --> 29:07.871
Michael, it's Don Self.

29:07.954 --> 29:09.122
How's it going?

29:09.205 --> 29:10.123
Well, well, well.

29:10.206 --> 29:11.458
Thought you were dead.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.168
If I had a dollar every time

29:13.251 --> 29:14.294
I've said that about you.

29:14.377 --> 29:16.296
You sound funny, Don.
What do you want?

29:16.379 --> 29:17.797
What do I want?

29:17.881 --> 29:20.592
You saw what that bastard
did to my wife, right?

29:21.259 --> 29:22.302
I want revenge.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.137
Where are you,
so we can hook back up?

29:24.220 --> 29:25.096
That's not necessary.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.348
This whole thing's
about to be over anyway.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.433
What do you mean
the whole thing?

29:28.516 --> 29:29.851
What's going on?

29:31.060 --> 29:32.896
I'm hanging up now, Don.

29:34.272 --> 29:35.356
Hello?

29:35.440 --> 29:36.566
Scofield's
on a burner.

29:36.649 --> 29:37.567
They're harder
to trace.

29:37.650 --> 29:38.985
We're gonna
need more time.

29:39.068 --> 29:40.653
Well, he's gonna call back.
He just gets a little riled up.

29:40.737 --> 29:41.821
But he'll call back.

29:41.905 --> 29:42.947
After he kills somebody?

29:43.031 --> 29:44.115
You heard,
this thing's

29:44.199 --> 29:45.784
about to be over. Lord
knows what that means.

29:45.867 --> 29:48.870
Get him back on the phone,
Agent Self now.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.335
So this cat said that

29:55.418 --> 29:57.337
Scofield and Linc
should recognize him

29:57.420 --> 29:58.546
when they see him.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.798
Recognize him from where?

29:59.881 --> 30:01.591
Look, I don't
know, man.

30:01.674 --> 30:03.676
Look, we've been in
a lot of messed up places.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.054
I'm just saying,
it makes a difference.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.514
Besides, I mean, did he say

30:07.597 --> 30:09.474
what he was gonna do
with Scylla if he gets it?

30:09.557 --> 30:12.227
All this guy said is that he
couldn't go to the government,

30:12.310 --> 30:15.355
'cause no one government
should have that much power.

30:15.438 --> 30:18.525
Now, look, man, you want to ask
him yourself, he's right there.

30:18.608 --> 30:19.692
He even give you a name?

30:19.776 --> 30:21.319
Said call him Paul.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.116
Sir.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.997
If anyone tries to
escape, aerate them.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.720
Keep an eye out
for anything suspicious.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.764
Scofield's a tunnel rat.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.110
You know...

31:02.193 --> 31:04.988
I wasn't the only fox in the
river to fall asleep at night,

31:05.071 --> 31:07.282
dreaming about treasures
was tucked beneath

31:07.365 --> 31:09.284
that white coat of yours.

31:10.493 --> 31:12.745
Every guy let their minds

31:12.829 --> 31:17.000
wander- eenie, meenie,
mynie, mo, in between you

31:17.083 --> 31:18.960
and Nurse Katie,

31:19.043 --> 31:21.629
sometimes settling on
the both of you.

31:22.338 --> 31:23.923
You digging that?

31:24.007 --> 31:25.800
All you old junkies
like a little

31:25.884 --> 31:27.051
dirty talk.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.309
Let me see where
those tracks are.

31:34.475 --> 31:35.894
I think I can, I think I can.

31:35.977 --> 31:40.315
If you let me go, I can tell the
courts that you saved my life.

31:40.398 --> 31:43.276
Teddy, if you let me go,
I can petition for leniency.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.446
I could tell them
you saved my life.

31:46.529 --> 31:48.531
I still have connections
from my father.

31:49.198 --> 31:51.784
You know, I was always thinking

31:51.868 --> 31:55.663
the way I was gonna get revenge
on Scofield was to kill him.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.249
Just driving that knife
right into his bleeding heart.

31:59.459 --> 32:00.668
And now...

32:01.878 --> 32:02.962
standing here

32:03.046 --> 32:06.341
looking at you,
I'm thinking, there's

32:06.424 --> 32:09.344
something worse
than death for him.

32:10.553 --> 32:12.805
Please, no.

32:15.016 --> 32:17.685
I'll return you
in one piece.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.690
But that piece
gonna be a little used.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.234
That's all.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.364
And every time
he looks at you...

32:31.240 --> 32:33.201
every time he wants
to be with you...

32:37.163 --> 32:39.374
he's gonna see me.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.245
Nothing!

33:19.288 --> 33:21.833
We got to get back
to the loft now.

33:41.936 --> 33:44.230
Hey, Michael, this is
Don calling back again.

33:44.313 --> 33:46.065
Listen, I know
you have a beef with me.

33:46.149 --> 33:47.316
All right?
And I understand,

33:47.400 --> 33:48.693
but I think I have
a way to get us

33:48.776 --> 33:50.153
all out of this.

33:50.236 --> 33:52.030
Okay, just please
call me back.

33:52.113 --> 33:53.197
How many messages
we going to

33:53.281 --> 33:55.408
leave this guy before
we move on to plan B?

33:55.491 --> 33:58.161
Look, he's going
to call back, okay?

33:58.244 --> 34:00.621
Excuse me, gentlemen, I need
to check on the patient.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.707
Just take a few minutes.

34:03.499 --> 34:05.293
He's going to call back, okay?

34:05.376 --> 34:06.669
There's coffee down the hall.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.379
He's going to call back.
Just be patient, okay?

34:08.463 --> 34:09.839
We're going to get him.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.595
How's it going, Doc?

34:15.678 --> 34:16.846
It's going well.

34:17.638 --> 34:19.515
Is this your first
time with me?

34:20.600 --> 34:22.101
Huh?

34:25.480 --> 34:26.522
What is that?

34:27.940 --> 34:29.442
I know you, right?

35:03.893 --> 35:05.686
Oh, yeah.

35:11.734 --> 35:16.739
Ooh, I bet you was a tomcat
back when you was using, huh?

35:16.823 --> 35:20.159
See, nowadays, you like to
look a fella in the eyes,

35:20.243 --> 35:21.619
but back then...

35:27.583 --> 35:29.836
Back then, oh...

35:29.919 --> 35:34.006
Back then, I bet the last
thing you wanted to do

35:34.090 --> 35:36.467
was see who you was
keeping company with.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.639
That's self worth for you.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.643
See, I've always
felt that the partner

35:45.726 --> 35:47.103
you choose to be with
is just a reflection

35:47.186 --> 35:50.022
of how you're really feeling
about yourself in that moment.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.190
And I got to tell
you, sister,

35:51.274 --> 35:52.984
right now, old
Teddy is feeling

35:53.067 --> 35:54.694
like a million bucks.

35:57.113 --> 36:00.324
Oh, yeah.

36:08.207 --> 36:10.293
And I'm going to be a
gentleman about this.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.920
I'm going to let you choose.

36:15.131 --> 36:17.842
You tell me
how you like it, Sara...

36:19.677 --> 36:21.929
and I'm going to give you
just what the doctor ordered.

36:25.224 --> 36:27.101
What, you got
something to say?

36:27.185 --> 36:28.561
Just that while you
and the other cons

36:28.644 --> 36:31.480
were taking care
of yourselves, I...

36:31.564 --> 36:33.065
Katie and I were going
over your medical records

36:33.149 --> 36:35.234
trying to figure out

36:35.318 --> 36:36.611
how best to
manage your care,

36:36.694 --> 36:38.487
figure out what
makes you tick.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.199
The thing I remember
about you, Theodore?

36:42.074 --> 36:43.492
Nothing makes you tick.

36:44.994 --> 36:47.288
You can't... tick.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.707
What exactly
are you implying?

36:49.790 --> 36:52.251
That the reason you rape
and kill and make pain

36:52.335 --> 36:53.753
is because you
can't make love.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.005
You've got neurogenic ED,

36:56.088 --> 36:58.674
probably caused by
injuries you sustained

36:58.758 --> 37:02.386
during your own
childhood sexual abuse.

37:03.387 --> 37:07.433
That is a lie.
That is a lie.

37:07.516 --> 37:08.768
Talk all you want about
what you're going

37:08.851 --> 37:10.519
to do to me, Theodore.
You and I both know

37:10.603 --> 37:13.314
there is very little
you can actually do.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.776
All right.

37:16.859 --> 37:20.112
Now, you are just going to take
back every word you just said.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.781
You hear me? You hear me?!

37:21.864 --> 37:24.742
There's no reason
to be ashamed of it, Teddy.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.786
So many men
suffer from it.

37:26.869 --> 37:28.412
Shut up!

37:35.544 --> 37:37.171
I don't know
what is more insulting:

37:37.255 --> 37:39.840
You thinking
I'm erectorally challenged

37:39.924 --> 37:42.885
or you thinking I'm going
to let you break out of here.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.637
Hmm, let me think
about that.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.806
I'm going to go
with the first one.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.683
Now,

37:48.766 --> 37:51.727
I'm going to show you
just how functional I am.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.483
Michael!

37:57.566 --> 38:00.903
Please...

38:09.203 --> 38:10.746
It's all right.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.416
Come here.

38:15.251 --> 38:16.627
You all right?

38:16.711 --> 38:18.754
Get me out of here.

38:27.638 --> 38:28.931
Show me.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.193
Why don't you
come inside, Alex?

38:41.277 --> 38:42.778
We have a lot to talk about.

38:53.205 --> 38:54.623
Before we do any business...

38:58.461 --> 39:00.796
I'd like some proof
that Pam is safe.

39:02.923 --> 39:06.427
We have an asset embedded
in the Company operations room

39:06.510 --> 39:09.263
who was able to access
the details of her location

39:09.347 --> 39:11.474
and the position
of her bird-dog.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.060
That's great.

39:14.143 --> 39:15.519
That's not good enough.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.148
I need to know
that she's in the clear.

39:19.231 --> 39:21.734
I'm ready to
execute that order,

39:21.817 --> 39:24.528
but first, I need you
to hand over Scylla.

39:29.450 --> 39:32.244
It's only a matter of time
before the General realizes

39:32.328 --> 39:35.289
that I turned my back on him.

39:36.874 --> 39:38.250
And Michael.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.170
And when he does,

39:42.046 --> 39:43.672
he's going to want revenge.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.884
Go make the call.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.261
Alex.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.436
This isn't about threats.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.647
This isn't about games.

39:59.730 --> 40:02.608
This is about how
people do business.

40:02.691 --> 40:06.362
I would be a fool if I gave
you everything you want

40:06.445 --> 40:08.406
before I had some
kind of guarantee

40:08.489 --> 40:10.366
that I'm going to get
everything I want.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.428
You've been busy.

40:35.349 --> 40:36.475
Here it is.

40:36.559 --> 40:37.893
Where's the rest of it?

40:43.774 --> 40:44.984
All right.

40:45.901 --> 40:47.820
I've kept my end
of the deal.

40:47.903 --> 40:49.822
Time for you
to make good on yours.

40:49.905 --> 40:52.366
Make the call, please, and
Linc and I will be on our way.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.453
Well, if it's okay with you, I'd
like to check this out first,

40:55.536 --> 40:56.954
make sure everything works

40:57.037 --> 40:58.914
before anybody
goes anywhere.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.875
Lock him up.

41:10.926 --> 41:12.928
What are you doing here?

41:14.096 --> 41:15.181
Saving your ass.

41:15.264 --> 41:17.224
I couldn't make
that choice, Sara.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.852
I had to save you both.

41:19.935 --> 41:23.272
If there's something you need
to do to protect Pam,

41:23.355 --> 41:24.940
you should do it.

41:31.989 --> 41:33.115
Alex.

41:36.744 --> 41:40.289
There may be some way
we can save everyone.

41:43.042 --> 41:46.587
The bad news is
my mother can read my every move.

41:46.670 --> 41:49.089
She says it's
because she knows me.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.217
The good news is

41:51.300 --> 41:52.510
she doesn't know you.

41:54.803 --> 41:56.013
I knew the General
would never honor

41:56.096 --> 41:57.473
his end of the arrangement.

41:57.556 --> 41:58.974
I knew...

41:59.058 --> 42:02.394
I knew he'd never
bring you to the exchange, so...

42:02.478 --> 42:03.812
I did what I had to do.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.818
How big an explosion
are we talking about?

42:10.528 --> 42:12.279
Big enough to end all this,

42:14.698 --> 42:16.492
so we can...

42:17.493 --> 42:19.161
maybe start something new.

42:22.998 --> 42:24.583
I mean, if that's...

42:24.667 --> 42:26.168
what you're feeling.

42:42.518 --> 42:45.104
Come on, you got to get
off the table. Come on.

42:45.187 --> 42:46.814
We got to get to the
other side of the room.

42:46.897 --> 42:49.066
Come on, Linc. Over here.

42:49.149 --> 42:51.068
Slide down the wall.
Slide down the wall.

42:52.194 --> 42:54.154
You ready to get
the hell out of here?

42:54.238 --> 42:55.864
Yeah.

42:59.493 --> 43:00.786
There's something wrong.

43:00.869 --> 43:02.871
I'm not getting
any kind of connection.

43:19.513 --> 43:21.015
Michael.
