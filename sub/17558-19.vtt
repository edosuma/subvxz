WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.805
Heartbeat is strong and
regular, 140's good.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.641
And he seems to be
chanting "Hail Satan."

00:07.675 --> 00:10.078
What?
I'm kidding.
Come on now.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.812
(laughs)
When you've been
delivering babies as long

00:11.845 --> 00:14.482
as we have, sometimes you
have to make your own fun.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.416
(chuckles weakly)

00:15.449 --> 00:17.685
I cannot believe the
baby's almost here.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.587
Went by so fast.
Did it now?

00:19.620 --> 00:22.523
So much for the stereotype
of gay men being more in tune

00:22.556 --> 00:24.058
with women's feelings, huh?

00:24.092 --> 00:26.760
Well, do you have any questions
for me?

00:26.794 --> 00:28.062
Oh, I think I'm good.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.597
Have any questions, Bry?

00:29.630 --> 00:31.999
Um, yes, actually.
I'm using that app that makes

00:32.032 --> 00:34.735
a picture of yourself
look 30 years older,
and I look like

00:34.768 --> 00:37.271
Hillary Clinton.
Should I be concerned.
Should you?

00:37.305 --> 00:38.672
(laughs)
(chuckles)

00:38.706 --> 00:40.408
Bryan, do you have any

00:40.441 --> 00:43.611
questions about our baby
for Dr. Venkatashar?

00:43.644 --> 00:45.946
No. I'm sure you've
got it covered.

00:45.979 --> 00:48.249
He doesn't think he needs to be
prepared for emergencies

00:48.282 --> 00:49.450
because I'm a doctor.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.619
David. Heimlich.

00:54.488 --> 00:57.125
Okay, here we go, sir.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.459
Big up, big up.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.694
(people clapping)

01:00.728 --> 01:03.897
My medical experience shouldn't
stop you from paying attention

01:03.931 --> 01:05.065
in our doctor's office

01:05.099 --> 01:06.267
when we're talking
about our baby.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.137
Okay, it's, you know,
a partnership, Bry.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.304
Yes, I know.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.939
I handle food, fashion, art,

01:11.972 --> 01:14.108
architecture and conversations
people enjoy.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.577
You handle boring medical stuff
and facts about batteries.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.112
First of all,
batteries are fascinating.

01:18.146 --> 01:20.481
And second of all, you should
know as much as any dad knows

01:20.514 --> 01:22.116
about the birthing process.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.451
(laughs) You know what?

01:23.484 --> 01:25.453
From now on, I am not a doctor.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.121
From now on, I'm just a dad.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.157
So, why don't you put that
toy away and be one, too?

01:29.190 --> 01:30.424
In your face.

01:30.458 --> 01:31.659
(Goldie laughs)

01:31.692 --> 01:33.394
What?

01:33.427 --> 01:34.462
I'm not a parent
to this child.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.629
I can be as immature as I want.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.499
VENKATASHAR:
So, Dr. Sawyer, what kind

01:38.532 --> 01:40.301
of fetal monitoring do you want
during the delivery?

01:40.334 --> 01:41.802
Internal, external?

01:41.835 --> 01:42.803
I have no idea,
I'm just a dad.

01:42.836 --> 01:43.804
Why don't you ask Bryan?

01:43.837 --> 01:45.606
I'm good with
whatever kind

01:45.639 --> 01:48.476
BeyoncÃ© used.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.249
(door closes)

01:55.283 --> 01:56.784
(David humming a tune)

01:56.817 --> 01:58.952
Hi, honey, how was
your basketball match?

01:58.986 --> 02:00.521
My match was fine.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.122
Thank you for
pretending to care.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.123
What's all this?

02:03.157 --> 02:04.258
You were right, David.

02:04.292 --> 02:05.626
There's nothing more important

02:05.659 --> 02:07.328
than our child's healthy journey
into this world,

02:07.361 --> 02:09.797
and it was wrong of me
to put that all on you.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.299
Oh, thanks, Bry.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.800
That makes me feel good.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.168
Especially now that
I've done some research

02:14.202 --> 02:16.036
and I see how many
blind spots you have

02:16.069 --> 02:17.305
due to your Western
medical training.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.307
Huh. Well, that was
a short-lived feeling.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.608
There are so many other

02:20.641 --> 02:22.476
viable birthing options, David.

02:22.510 --> 02:25.012
There's the natural birth,
there's a water birth,

02:25.045 --> 02:27.648
there's acupuncture instead of
epidural anesthesia.

02:27.681 --> 02:28.816
It's very exciting.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.818
(sighs): Look, Bry,

02:30.851 --> 02:32.486
I'm all for railing

02:32.520 --> 02:34.655
against the traditional
medical establishment.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.689
I mean, I never got
those veneers

02:35.723 --> 02:37.558
that Dr. McKay recommended,
did I?

02:37.591 --> 02:38.626
No.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.294
But there's a reason

02:40.328 --> 02:41.729
why some things
are established.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.297
It's because they work.

02:43.331 --> 02:46.800
They safeguard against the
many dangers of childbirth.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.669
David, you want me
to be more involved,

02:48.702 --> 02:50.471
and then when I become
informed and passionate,

02:50.504 --> 02:51.639
you dismiss me?

02:51.672 --> 02:53.707
You're right.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.008
All right.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.144
Let's take a look at

02:57.177 --> 02:58.312
your alternative
birthing methods.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.248
Good, because I signed us all up

03:00.281 --> 03:02.316
for a birth class
at the natural birthing center.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.184
I've never been
so excited to spend

03:04.218 --> 03:05.886
three hours with a room
full of strangers

03:05.919 --> 03:07.321
wearing Tom's throwaway shoes.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.690
I-I don't think you're supposed
to throw them away.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.059
BRICE:
Wow.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.562
It's a beautiful woman
with a beer gut to be proud of.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.230
Oh, hi, Brice.
Hi.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.431
No, I'm actually pregnant.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.499
Really?
(laughs)

03:18.532 --> 03:19.933
Wow, you have a firm grip

03:19.967 --> 03:21.101
and smell like peaches.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.237
(chuckles)
Uh, is my nana here?

03:23.271 --> 03:24.605
Jane?

03:24.638 --> 03:26.774
She's your gra-- she told
me she was your mother.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.609
Well, probably because
a lot of men

03:28.642 --> 03:31.445
don't associate
"grandma" with "sexy."

03:31.479 --> 03:33.013
Well, I'm sure
there's a whole legion

03:33.046 --> 03:34.948
of Susan Lucci fans
that would disagree with you.

03:34.982 --> 03:37.251
Your grandmother is
out showing a house,

03:37.285 --> 03:38.519
but she'll be back soon.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.688
Great. I don't want
her to hear this.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.624
(clears throat)

03:43.657 --> 03:45.293
I want to rent
a retail space.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.628
I design and sell clothes
at the farmer's market,

03:47.661 --> 03:49.763
and I've been selling
a lot of them, actually.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.265
I use Bryan and David's
guesthouse

03:51.299 --> 03:53.767
as a base of operations
but i-it's too small.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.269
I need to expand.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.937
Well, that's very ambitious
for someone

03:56.970 --> 03:58.606
who's already sort of expanded.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.441
Well, that's why I don't
want Nana to know.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.443
She'll try to scare me
out of it

04:02.476 --> 04:03.911
and I'm already so scared.

04:03.944 --> 04:04.978
Mm.
But there's

04:05.012 --> 04:06.280
this little voice inside me

04:06.314 --> 04:07.715
that keeps telling me...

04:07.748 --> 04:09.950
this is the time.
Hmm.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.285
And it's not the baby.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.086
(laughs)
At least, I don't think it is.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.289
If it is, he has
a really deep voice.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.757
(deep voice):
This is the time.

04:16.790 --> 04:17.925
(both chuckle)

04:17.958 --> 04:19.327
You know, you remind me
of my daughter.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.094
And I'm not lying,

04:21.128 --> 04:22.463
she really is my daughter.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.764
You know, I think
your grandmother

04:23.797 --> 04:24.798
basically catfished me.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.300
Let's see what

04:26.334 --> 04:28.101
we can find you
here, all right?
Here we go.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.938
Hmm, Nana's right.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.139
You do have fast fingers.

04:33.307 --> 04:34.642
Yeah, texting.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.410
She said you were fast
at texting.

04:36.444 --> 04:39.246
(typing)

04:39.279 --> 04:42.149
Yes, we'd love to do
one of your songs on Sing!

04:42.182 --> 04:43.651
You've got big fans
around here.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.818
(Nikki farts)

04:44.852 --> 04:48.756
Oh, Nikki, you will just
not stop pooping.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.624
I'm sorry, Ms. Minaj.

04:50.658 --> 04:51.992
I wasn't talking to you.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.594
(phone beeps, Nikki coos)
Hello?

04:53.627 --> 04:54.928
Hey, Rocky, I'm here.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.130
So cool we have the
place to ourselves.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.632
What are we doing today?

04:58.666 --> 05:00.634
Girl, I'm just here
to make sure you don't

05:00.668 --> 05:03.471
set yourself on fire while your
mom is at that birth class.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.806
Hey, what's wrong
with Nikki's hair?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.641
Oh, no, she's got
that stubborn hair.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.142
I think her dad was a broom.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.144
Do you need some help?
I could watch her.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.714
I'm CPR certified,
well-versed with Dr. Seuss

05:13.747 --> 05:15.783
and I take care
of a pack of feral cats

05:15.816 --> 05:17.818
that live under my school.
I'm more than qualified.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.119
(chuckles):
No, thanks, honey,

05:19.152 --> 05:21.121
I think I've got it
all under control.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.756
Let me... oh, damn it!

05:24.324 --> 05:26.326
Oh, God, I actually
could use some help.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.895
I've got a meeting with that

05:27.928 --> 05:30.297
Chris Brown to discuss
rehabilitating his image

05:30.330 --> 05:32.700
by playing a transgendered
soup kitchen worker.

05:32.733 --> 05:33.967
(sighs)

05:34.001 --> 05:35.302
God.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.004
(bell jingles)

05:37.037 --> 05:38.406
DAVID:
All right, watch your step.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.473
(Goldie gasps)

05:39.507 --> 05:41.842
Wow, this is gonna
be great, guys!

05:41.875 --> 05:44.578
I am so excited to try all
the different birthing methods.

05:44.612 --> 05:47.147
And I want to try them all,
I've only ever done missionary.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.181
(chuckles)

05:48.215 --> 05:49.517
Uh, so, guys,

05:49.550 --> 05:52.820
if anyone asks,
I am not a doctor.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.988
Just a regular dad
here to open my mind

05:55.022 --> 05:56.557
to the exciting
possibilities

05:56.590 --> 05:58.358
of alternative
birthing methods.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.928
For which I thank you, and I
grant you your number one choice

06:00.961 --> 06:02.730
for our next romantic
getaway destination.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.498
Oh, Cape Canaveral.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.434
Hey, folks,
come and join us.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.601
It's started.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.770
(chuckles)
All right.
Okay.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.739
Hi, I'm Frank.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.274
And this is
my soul mate, Amy.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.843
Hi.

06:15.876 --> 06:19.046
Oh. I'm Bryan, uh,
this is our surrogate, Goldie,

06:19.079 --> 06:20.347
and, uh, this is David.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.550
I would call him my soul mate,
if he could learn

06:22.583 --> 06:24.852
how to rinse a plate before
he put it in the dishwasher.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.186
(all laugh)

06:26.219 --> 06:28.121
You look like you're
about to pop.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.923
What are you,
about, uh, 38 weeks?

06:29.957 --> 06:32.125
Yes! Do you practice
midwifery?

06:32.159 --> 06:33.126
Uh, no, no.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.295
Just a... just
a regular man.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.465
Fireman, actually.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.099
Well, technically,
smoke jumper.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.934
You know,
forest fires,

06:40.968 --> 06:42.235
mountains...

06:42.269 --> 06:43.270
Yeah, it's hard work.

06:43.303 --> 06:46.640
So, you guys must be
just so excited.

06:46.674 --> 06:47.875
We are.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.276
We're doing a hypno-birth.

06:49.309 --> 06:52.446
Yeah.
We're socialized to
be afraid of labor,

06:52.480 --> 06:53.647
but our bodies aren't.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.449
Yes, that's exactly
what I want

06:55.483 --> 06:56.484
for our child.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.118
Our son's journey
into this world

06:58.151 --> 07:00.821
to be as natural
and loving as possible.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.456
Without all that intrusive

07:02.490 --> 07:04.825
medical intervention.
Right, David?

07:04.858 --> 07:06.159
Yeah. I mean, who needs

07:06.193 --> 07:08.128
antibiotics and
a surgical team

07:08.161 --> 07:09.997
when you have sandalwood
oil and fresh mint?

07:10.030 --> 07:11.465
GOLDIE:
Oh, I love fresh mint

07:11.499 --> 07:12.566
in my iced tea.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.801
I love sandals, too.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.002
My thoughts are
really scattered.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.436
Hey, Rocky.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.940
Hey. So, how badly
did my baby wear you out?

07:19.973 --> 07:20.941
Not at all.

07:20.974 --> 07:21.942
Nikki's eaten,

07:21.975 --> 07:23.410
played, peed,

07:23.443 --> 07:25.278
slept, cooed.
Hmm.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.447
Did you miss
your mommy?

07:27.481 --> 07:29.583
You miss your mama? Hey.

07:29.617 --> 07:32.285
Oh, my God, what happened
to my baby's hair?
I did it.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.121
Now, how does
a ten-year-old white girl,

07:34.154 --> 07:35.756
who's whiter
than Dakota Fanning,

07:35.789 --> 07:37.090
know how to do black hair?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.158
From watching Gavin.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.293
He's a YouTube lifestyle guru

07:40.327 --> 07:41.995
with tips for tweens.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.597
(over computer):
So easy, even white people
can learn!

07:43.631 --> 07:46.166
Next up, a history
of black hair:

07:46.199 --> 07:48.201
from finger waves
to high-top fades.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.303
Plus, how to use
a hot comb and relaxer.

07:50.337 --> 07:53.641
Queen Latifah, I'm putting you
on front street.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.944
So, do you need anything else?

07:56.977 --> 07:57.978
(coos)

07:58.011 --> 08:00.047
That will be all.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.782
INSTRUCTOR:
By being on all fours,

08:01.815 --> 08:04.552
you allow the pelvis
to expand 30% more,

08:04.585 --> 08:06.554
making for a more natural

08:06.587 --> 08:08.956
and less painful delivery.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.691
Looks exactly how I used to show

08:10.724 --> 08:12.292
my champion goat
at the state fair.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.794
Uh, I-I'm sorry, Debra.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.128
Yes, uh, hi.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.496
This is all great in theory,

08:16.530 --> 08:19.299
but in the case
of a real emergency

08:19.332 --> 08:21.468
now, wouldn't this
position actually make it

08:21.501 --> 08:24.471
more difficult for a
physician to gain access?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.306
That's exactly
what Western medicine

08:26.339 --> 08:28.576
wants you to believe,
when, in fact,

08:28.609 --> 08:30.243
giving birth on your back...
Wow.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.913
You seem to know a lot
about birthing babies
for a smoke jumper.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.414
Oh, yeah.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.249
A lot of animals
in the woods.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.485
You ever seen an elk whelp?

08:38.518 --> 08:41.088
I have.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.223
This is just one example

08:43.256 --> 08:44.658
of how to create

08:44.692 --> 08:46.426
a peaceful environment
for a home birth.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.061
This is footage
from one that

08:48.095 --> 08:49.396
(woman crying over TV)
I facilitated on
the solstice.

08:49.429 --> 08:52.265
Notice how engorged

08:52.299 --> 08:54.267
her opening is.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.502
And there's
her husband,

08:55.535 --> 08:57.738
and her two
small children

08:57.771 --> 08:59.907
nude and unashamed

08:59.940 --> 09:01.108
alongside her.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.275
Ah, there!

09:02.309 --> 09:03.443
Success.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.946
What you are looking at is

09:05.979 --> 09:08.415
full dilation.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.284
Here comes

09:11.318 --> 09:14.622
(distorted, echoes):
the baby...

09:14.655 --> 09:16.523
A lot more meconium and blood

09:16.556 --> 09:18.325
than you had imagined, huh?

09:21.995 --> 09:23.563
Okay.

09:23.597 --> 09:24.598
There you go.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.966
Dr. Sawyer?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.635
Dr. Sawyer's man-wife.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.270
I heard you passed out
at your birth class.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.773
Uh, yeah, I'm very embarrassed.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.207
I mean, you know,
who faints anymore

09:34.241 --> 09:36.409
besides anorexics
and maids on telenovelas?

09:36.443 --> 09:37.577
(chuckles)
Oh,

09:37.611 --> 09:39.747
witnessing childbirth
is not for everyone,

09:39.780 --> 09:40.914
Mrs. Doctor Sawyer.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.249
Bryan.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.416
A father person

09:43.450 --> 09:44.718
who faints in the delivery room

09:44.752 --> 09:46.153
can distract the physician

09:46.186 --> 09:48.255
both from the patient
and the child.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.291
(clattering)
Like this.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.826
Oh, my God,
I don't want to be that guy.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.128
I don't want to put
our baby at risk.
You're just

09:55.162 --> 09:56.329
intimidated by vagina.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.464
And there is that.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.332
I really am sorry, madam.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.309
You sure you're gonna be okay
while I'm at the store?

10:09.342 --> 10:12.279
As long as that's a sack
of Vicodin you're carrying, yes.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.748
Well, maybe I'll get you
a little codeine.

10:14.782 --> 10:15.749
(grunts)

10:15.783 --> 10:17.084
I am sorry

10:17.117 --> 10:18.952
that you can't be
in the delivery room.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.420
I know how important
it was for you.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.122
(doorbell rings)

10:23.156 --> 10:25.292
Hey.
Hi.
Hey.

10:25.325 --> 10:28.095
Uh, Joel, Frank,
from the birthing class.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.930
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.765
We came by to see how
Bryan was feeling.
Oh.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.166
That's so sweet.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.669
(both chuckle)
Uh, he's in the den.
Come on in.

10:35.703 --> 10:36.837
Okay.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.505
Yeah.

10:39.506 --> 10:40.473
(door closes)
Hi.

10:40.507 --> 10:41.975
Hi, Bryan.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.544
Uh... how you feeling?

10:44.577 --> 10:46.880
You know, bossy and needy,
but that's sort of

10:46.914 --> 10:48.916
an ongoing thing
unrelated to the accident.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.785
Uh, come in, come in, please.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.220
Yeah.

10:53.253 --> 10:56.123
It's, um, very nice of you
to check in on me.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.658
I'm sorry to say, I will not be
able to come back to the class.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.293
Hmm.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.395
Lucky bastard.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.631
I thought you guys
were excited to have

11:04.664 --> 11:07.400
a front row seat to see your kid
plop into the world.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.337
Not... at... all.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.139
We're freaked out.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.474
We don't want to see
all that. We just...

11:14.507 --> 11:16.509
tell our wives what
they want to hear.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.511
Look, if you feel
this strongly about it,

11:18.545 --> 11:20.981
you owe it to your wives
just to be honest.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.717
Partnership is about
telling the truth,

11:23.751 --> 11:25.085
even when it's not easy.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.555
(typing)

11:28.588 --> 11:30.824
Hey, Rocky. Let me know
when you're ready for me

11:30.858 --> 11:33.426
to take Nikki, 'cause I have
a big day planned for us.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.762
I thought we'd start off

11:34.795 --> 11:37.430
with a puppet show inspired
by early Kabuki theater.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.167
No, thanks. Besides, Nikki
is offended by whiteface.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.402
I got it all
under control today.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.905
Are you sure you don't
need a babysitter?

11:44.938 --> 11:46.506
'Cause let's face it.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.508
I'm a better mom than you.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.010
What did you just say to me?

11:50.043 --> 11:51.344
You're a terrible mom.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.113
You're impatient,
you can't cook,

11:53.146 --> 11:55.348
your singing voice
is anything but soothing

11:55.382 --> 11:56.917
and you sext and drive.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.285
You really think
those qualities

11:58.318 --> 12:01.254
are conducive
to successful child rearing?

12:01.288 --> 12:02.455
Listen to the girl,

12:02.489 --> 12:04.024
Rocky.
Mama?

12:04.057 --> 12:06.359
You don't have time
to raise no child.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.396
You're too busy climbing
that stupid corporate ladder.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.630
I can't climb no ladder,

12:10.663 --> 12:12.299
'cause I ain't got but one foot.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.801
But if you're
always workin',

12:13.834 --> 12:16.269
how you gonna find a husband
to help raise that baby?

12:16.303 --> 12:17.304
SHANIA:
Face it, Rocky.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.106
No matter how much you pretend

12:19.139 --> 12:21.741
to be Nikki's mom,
you are going to fail,

12:21.775 --> 12:23.576
because you're not good enough.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.279
What do you want from me?
I'm doing the best that I can.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.816
(Nikki fussing)
I just wanted to know
if you're sure

12:28.849 --> 12:30.450
you don't need
a babysitter.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.485
I'm sure. Now please leave.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.955
I have work to do and a baby
to take care of.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.423
I don't need your help.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.458
(typing, Nikki fussing)

12:44.798 --> 12:46.433
Well, I think it's genius. Now,
here's what we're gonna do.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.968
We're gonna negotiate
a year's lease

12:48.001 --> 12:50.603
and then boom-- you watch
all your dreams come true.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.272
A year?
(chuckles)

12:52.305 --> 12:54.307
Th-that's a big,
scary commitment.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.309
You make it sound so easy.
Oh,

12:56.343 --> 12:58.311
it's not easy.
Starting a new business,

12:58.345 --> 13:00.113
putting it all on the line--
it's terrifying.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.481
Building a
business is like...

13:01.514 --> 13:04.284
well, like having a baby.
I mean, it's painful and messy

13:04.317 --> 13:05.953
and everybody's staring
at your goods.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.287
(chuckles)
(laughs)

13:07.320 --> 13:08.922
That's why most people
try to avoid it.

13:08.956 --> 13:12.092
But... they are missing out
because you're about

13:12.125 --> 13:14.427
to create a whole new,
big, beautiful life.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.729
Now, isn't that worth
the price of fear?

13:18.698 --> 13:20.467
Oh, hi, Bryan.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.935
Hey. Hi.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.303
Uh, I'm going
to the fabric store.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.671
You want to come?

13:24.704 --> 13:26.106
Oh, I don't really like
to see fabric

13:26.139 --> 13:27.507
before it's clothes.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.776
It's like seeing chocolate chips
before they're cookies.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.946
Have fun.
I will. Thank you.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.482
You're welcome.
It's gonna be great.
(chuckles)

13:35.515 --> 13:36.884
Hey, hot shot.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.618
How's it feel to
have impending

13:38.651 --> 13:40.653
fatherhood put its
boot on your neck?

13:40.687 --> 13:41.821
Uh, well, I fainted

13:41.855 --> 13:43.490
during a video
of a birthing class,

13:43.523 --> 13:45.959
so if that's any indication.
Well, if it makes
you feel better

13:45.993 --> 13:48.128
I fainted during an episode
of Sons of Anarchy.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.297
Our doctor says that I shouldn't
be in the delivery room

13:50.330 --> 13:51.598
when we have the baby.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.968
Says I can't handle it.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.971
Ah. You know, the same thing
happened to me

13:58.005 --> 13:59.439
when my daughter was born.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.910
So I didn't go in.

14:02.943 --> 14:06.179
And I've been trying to make up
for it ever since.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.814
Well, that's sweet
that you make

14:07.847 --> 14:09.582
more of an effort
with your daughter.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.184
No, it's not really about Amber.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.253
I'm trying to...
make it up to myself.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.588
I wasn't there to
hear her first cry

14:15.622 --> 14:17.925
or see her eyes
blink open.

14:17.958 --> 14:21.761
Oh, I'd gladly trade the fear
of that moment of discomfort

14:21.794 --> 14:24.264
if I could do it all over again.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.766
I'd Instagram the hell out
of those moments.

14:26.799 --> 14:29.469
(chuckles)

14:30.870 --> 14:34.574
Listen, my only regrets
are the fears I didn't face.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.178
That little boy can't wait
to meet you, Bryan.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.980
You be there to shake his hand.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.318
(indistinct chatter)

14:51.992 --> 14:54.962
Husbands,
come with me.
Uh, but, dude,

14:54.995 --> 14:57.564
what's up? You had
the free pass out of here.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.932
Yeah, we're about to tell
our wives we won't be

14:58.966 --> 15:00.300
in the delivery room,
just like you.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.937
No, guys, I was wrong.
We have to be there.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.239
I always believed that fear
belonged to other people,

15:06.273 --> 15:08.641
weaker people,
and that it didn't touch me.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.610
But when it
does touch you,

15:10.643 --> 15:12.779
you realize
it's been there all along.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.948
Wow. That's deep.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.450
Yeah, and it was deep
when Jodie Foster said it

15:17.484 --> 15:19.119
in The Brave One I watched it
last night on cable, too.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.454
I'm telling my wife right now.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.957
But I...
Amy, I need to tell you
something.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.292
My water just broke.
What?

15:25.325 --> 15:26.960
In the bathroom. My water broke.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.128
When was your
last contraction?

15:28.161 --> 15:29.462
I've been having
them all day.

15:29.496 --> 15:30.797
I thought it was
false labor.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.432
I'm-I'm not due for two weeks.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.933
Oh, I'm having one now.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.935
Ow! Ow!
All right, we need to get you
to the hospital.

15:35.969 --> 15:38.138
No hospital. We can bring
this new life into the world

15:38.171 --> 15:39.572
right here. I'll fill
the birthing tub.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.108
Somebody find my flute.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.977
Shut the (bleep) up
and get me to a hospital!

15:45.278 --> 15:47.447
Oh.
Right, left,
right, left.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.783
(screaming)

15:50.817 --> 15:52.785
All right,
take deep breaths, Amy.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.421
You're gonna be fine.
Bryan,

15:54.454 --> 15:56.256
how we doing?
Well, traffic is a mess.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.159
There's a legless man being
pulled in a wagon by a dog.
Oh, that is

15:59.192 --> 16:01.694
a strong puggle. Geez!
Oh, my God!

16:01.728 --> 16:04.031
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

16:04.064 --> 16:05.698
All right, Amy, listen
to me. Listen to me.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.635
I'm gonna need to examine you.
Is that all right?
Anything!

16:08.668 --> 16:10.670
I don't care!
Okay. Flip around, flip around.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.639
Lean on Goldie.
Here we go.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.442
Frank, can you hand me
the hand sanitizer, please?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.944
GOLDIE:
Keep breathing, Amy.
Frank. Hand sanitizer.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.646
Hand. Sanitizer.
Thank you.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.615
Okay.
Wait, isn't he a smoke jumper?

16:22.649 --> 16:24.851
Oh, okay. We're gonna be
at the hospital in ten minutes.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.786
Oh, ten minutes. That's great!
Hey, that's nothing.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.621
BRYAN: That's good, right?
GOLDIE:
Ten minutes is great!

16:28.655 --> 16:31.291
Bryan, pull over. We're not
gonna make it to the hospital.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.326
What?
What?
What?

16:34.861 --> 16:36.996
DAVID:
All right, easy.
Put all your weight on me.

16:37.030 --> 16:40.833
Okay, perfect. Just take
a breath. Bryan, can you
get those seats down?

16:40.867 --> 16:44.037
I'm trying! I don't know how!
DAVID: I thought that's
why you got this car, to put

16:44.071 --> 16:45.472
canoes and tents
and things in it.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.973
I just said that because
it's politically incorrect

16:47.006 --> 16:48.141
to drive a car this big!

16:48.175 --> 16:49.476
What are you guys
doing here?

16:49.509 --> 16:52.045
A hell of a route you took--
Sunset on a Friday?

16:52.079 --> 16:54.247
(sobbing)

16:54.281 --> 16:57.184
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.752
Okay, Amy, I know this
wasn't your birth plan,

16:59.786 --> 17:01.988
but it's happening.
Ah! I want to push!

17:02.021 --> 17:04.324
Well, that's exactly
what you should do.
On your next contraction,

17:04.357 --> 17:05.525
I want you to push,

17:05.558 --> 17:07.026
okay?
Frank, this is nothing.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.028
(screaming)

17:09.062 --> 17:11.598
(gasps)
Okay.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.333
Amy.
(screaming)

17:13.366 --> 17:17.170
All right, great. Let's do
that one more time, okay?

17:17.204 --> 17:19.706
Your next contraction,
a nice big push.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.541
(screaming, sobbing)

17:22.575 --> 17:24.177
All right, stop pushing.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.578
Frank, I need your help.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.847
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.449
DAVID: I need some
help here, please!
Okay, okay. I'm-I'm right here.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.017
I'm right here. I'm right here,
David. I'm right here.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.018
Okay, uh...

17:32.051 --> 17:34.354
Amy, I want you to grab
onto your knees

17:34.387 --> 17:36.756
okay? Just grab onto those
knees. You're doing great.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.858
(quietly): Listen to me, Bryan.
The baby's anterior shoulder

17:38.891 --> 17:40.693
is obstructed behind the pelvis.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.195
I need to shift it,
okay? I need you

17:42.229 --> 17:43.696
to take your hands
and put them like this

17:43.730 --> 17:46.533
and put direct pressure
right on the pelvis.
Okay.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.102
Right here. Right here.
Perfect, perfect.
Okay. Okay.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.937
All right, here we go, Amy.
Amy,

17:50.970 --> 17:52.772
I know this is very scary
and there's a lot going on,

17:52.805 --> 17:54.874
but you have to trust that David
knows what he's doing, okay?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.609
Yeah.
DAVID:
You're doing great, Amy.

17:56.643 --> 17:57.710
Oh, my God. That's
a real vagina.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.446
(Amy screaming)
BRYAN:
Oh, my God.

17:59.479 --> 18:00.613
That's a baby coming
out of the vagina.

18:00.647 --> 18:03.783
Um, you, uh... plaid
shirt, plaid shirt.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.152
I'm sorry I can't think
of your name right now,

18:05.185 --> 18:07.320
but this is amazing.
Uh, you have to see this.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.788
I-I know you're afraid,

18:08.821 --> 18:10.790
but whatever it is,
it's not worth missing this.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.293
Ow! Frank! I need you!

18:13.326 --> 18:14.294
Get over here.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.795
(Amy sobbing)
DAVID:
Frank,

18:15.828 --> 18:17.597
I want you to grab
your wife's hand.

18:17.630 --> 18:21.100
(Amy sobbing)
All right, you're doing great,
Amy. Keep breathing.

18:21.134 --> 18:24.804
After your next contraction,
take one more big push.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.439
(screaming)

18:26.473 --> 18:27.607
(screaming)

18:27.640 --> 18:30.109
All right, Frank, Frank.
Tell me about your baby.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.011
Do you know what you're having?
No,

18:32.044 --> 18:34.013
we wanted it
to be a surprise.

18:34.046 --> 18:36.649
He wants a girl, but I-I don't
care as long as she doesn't

18:36.683 --> 18:40.520
look like my sister.
(screaming)

18:40.553 --> 18:42.989
(screaming)
DAVID:
All right.

18:43.022 --> 18:47.860
(baby crying)
DAVID:
Okay! There you go.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.297
Happy birthday.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.698
Here you go, Papa.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.533
You have a
beautiful daughter.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.369
JOEL:
Smoke jumper!

18:56.403 --> 19:01.007
CROWD:
Smoke jumper! Smoke jumper!
Smoke jumper!

19:07.314 --> 19:09.616
(knocking)

19:09.649 --> 19:13.019
Oh, hey, Rocky.
Don't talk. Just listen.

19:13.052 --> 19:15.722
So, you don't
want lemonade?

19:15.755 --> 19:17.490
I'll take a lemonade.

19:26.399 --> 19:29.202
Shania, I've come to realize...

19:29.236 --> 19:31.538
that lemonade needs sugar.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.640
Yuck.
(Nikki coos)

19:33.673 --> 19:35.308
Anyway, I'm sorry I was rude

19:35.342 --> 19:37.009
when you offered
to babysit Nikki.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.512
I know you see me
as a strong, confident,

19:39.546 --> 19:41.414
Michelle Obama-like
beacon of hope...

19:41.448 --> 19:43.683
I don't see you that way.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.819
But the truth is I was scared.

19:46.853 --> 19:50.857
When I saw how naturally taking
care of Nikki came to you...

19:51.891 --> 19:55.094
...you just made it
look so easy.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.764
Half the time she just grabbed
at my glasses

19:57.797 --> 20:01.067
and the other half I made
fart noises with my mouth.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.536
Sure, it was fun
for an hour,

20:03.570 --> 20:06.273
but at the end of the day,
she needs you.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.374
You're her mom.

20:07.407 --> 20:10.543
(jabbering)

20:10.577 --> 20:13.780
(chuckles)
Hey.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.783
I love you.
(chuckles)

20:16.816 --> 20:19.286
You gonna sweeten up
that lemonade or what?

20:19.319 --> 20:22.088
(chuckles)
Hey, sweetie.

20:22.121 --> 20:25.425
Mwah! Look at you.
Look how pretty you are.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.428
I'm your mama. Yes. Yes, I am.

20:28.461 --> 20:32.432
GOLDIE: When I get scared, my
first instinct is to run away.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.434
Or shut my eyes real tight.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.603
Or both at the same time.

20:36.636 --> 20:40.607
Thank you so much. That's
very nice. Can I get you...

20:40.640 --> 20:43.610
GOLDIE: But if you run around
with your eyes closed,

20:43.643 --> 20:46.613
not only do you bump
into walls a lot,

20:46.646 --> 20:49.682
you miss out on seeing
some pretty amazing stuff.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.891
Peekaboo! Peekaboo!
So what I'm learning

20:58.925 --> 21:02.595
is to face my fears head on.

21:02.629 --> 21:06.466
I don't run anymore,
and I don't cover my eyes.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.437
I'm embracing my fears
because...

21:10.470 --> 21:13.105
they're the seeds
of a new life.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.808
They bring new joys
and new dreams.

21:15.842 --> 21:22.815
When I look my fears straight
in the eye, I see my future.
