00:02.103 --> 00:04.069
- Kelly marie duff...
I know this may seem fast.

00:04.204 --> 00:07.139
Let's dive in, let's do it!
Let's get married!

00:07.141 --> 00:09.775
- What did you say?
- I told him I need to think
about it.

00:09.777 --> 00:14.179
It's a big decision,
and I don't know where to find
the answers.

00:14.314 --> 00:16.915
- I thought
you were bringing friends.
- I didn't find anyone.

00:16.984 --> 00:19.617
- You said it wasn't gonna be
a problem.
<i> - Hey, look,</i>

00:19.653 --> 00:22.054
Something came up for tomorrow;
we need to talk about this now.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.989
- Yeah.
<i> - So tell me about yourself,</i>

00:23.991 --> 00:26.057
Stuart. What kind of business
are you in?

00:26.093 --> 00:29.561
(naz): Import, export.
- That's very sexual.
It's dangerous.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.262
- Shanika!

00:31.298 --> 00:34.733
- I had to tell tobin
I couldn't find anyone.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.469
They're not gonna let me out
that easy.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.005
<i> - It's my grandma's.</i>
<i> She always wanted you</i>
<i> to have it.</i>

00:40.140 --> 00:42.407
<i> - Yes, I'll marry you.</i>

00:47.481 --> 00:50.782
(sirens wailing)

00:52.419 --> 00:54.219
Oh...

00:54.354 --> 00:55.787
Ah-ha-ha.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.624
Thank you.

00:58.626 --> 01:01.159
- Hey, michael. Um...
What do I want to eat today?

01:01.195 --> 01:03.562
Um, can I have an egg sandwich,
please?

01:03.564 --> 01:07.633
- Oh! I got the last one. Sorry.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.167
- Oh, my god!

01:10.971 --> 01:13.171
I'm... That's talking
about the last egg sandwich,

01:13.207 --> 01:16.508
And that's upsetting,
when there's no eggs around.
What's new? Hey, what's up?

01:16.544 --> 01:19.310
- Not much.
- No? Nothing to report?
No news at all?

01:19.346 --> 01:20.779
- You talking about work news?

01:20.914 --> 01:23.849
Like, professional things
that two colleagues
need to discuss?

01:23.918 --> 01:27.652
- Well, you know what?
Yeah, it could be work,
or it could be, um...

01:28.923 --> 01:30.923
You know what?
It could be personal.
For instance,

01:31.058 --> 01:33.525
My mother clogged the toilet
this morning by flushing
a bunch of chicken bones down,

01:33.660 --> 01:35.928
Because she didn't want
the raccoons to eat them,
and then they'd choke.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.529
Isn't that strange?
How 'bout you?

01:37.531 --> 01:40.132
Do you have any strange news
that you would like to report?

01:40.134 --> 01:42.367
(sighing)
- nope.

01:42.369 --> 01:44.402
- Or naz, I can tell you
a little something about naz.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.472
He is a man that I am seeing.
He's a cop currently undercover,

01:46.607 --> 01:48.940
But he still finds time
to see me. You know why?

01:48.976 --> 01:51.476
Because we're romantically
involved, it's not like we're
getting married or anything,

01:51.479 --> 01:53.411
Because if we were,
I would tell you.

01:54.414 --> 01:57.082
- Why?
You don't need my permission.

01:57.217 --> 02:01.352
Why do we need other people's
opinions influencing how we feel
all the time?

02:01.388 --> 02:03.955
- You're right, we don't.
But I think it's a good idea
that at some--

02:03.991 --> 02:06.825
- You might not think
I'm making a good decision
about a particular thing,

02:06.960 --> 02:10.962
And I might not think
you're making a good decision
about a particular thing.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.366
But we don't need
to tell each other that.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.035
- Oh, my god, what do you mean?
What am I doing?
Is this about my mom?

02:17.171 --> 02:20.372
Or about elliot?
Or am I making a mistake
where naz is concerned?

02:20.441 --> 02:22.708
If you know something,
I think it's really important
you should tell me,

02:22.710 --> 02:25.043
Because I would do the same
for you. Why don't you tell me?
What am I doing--

02:25.112 --> 02:27.646
- What do I have to do to make
you stop nattering in my ear?

02:27.715 --> 02:31.984
- Well, you could take a turn
to talk, share some of your, uh,

02:31.986 --> 02:36.120
Impressive, albeit very, very,
very shocking news.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.759
Or you could just give me half
your egg sandwich.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.745
(knocking)

03:01.815 --> 03:03.348
Yeah, no, but, uh--

03:05.019 --> 03:07.953
Are we gonna keep flirting
with each other,
or can I take you to the prom?

03:10.024 --> 03:12.123
(chuckling)
no, look,
if you're still frosty,

03:12.159 --> 03:13.625
I can float you a taste.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.194
Yeah, on me.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.764
Yeah?

03:18.899 --> 03:20.098
Yeah.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.768
Yeah, my guy'll send you
the details. Yeah.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.438
(chuckling)

03:28.609 --> 03:30.709
- Okay, okay, okay!

03:33.113 --> 03:36.848
Yeah. I knew the boat
felt a little heavier this time.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.184
(chuckling)
so when's my next run?

03:39.319 --> 03:41.386
- No, I need something else
from you this time.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.122
Can you arrange that
with my guys?

03:44.258 --> 03:47.525
- Come on!
Team player over here!
I'm your guy.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.531
- Okay, look.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.801
We've had some run-ins
with another crew,

03:55.803 --> 04:00.138
And this... I need this...
I need this to go smooth.

04:01.341 --> 04:02.808
Can you do that?

04:03.810 --> 04:05.811
- Consider it done.
- Alright.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.947
- Hey, speaking of team players,
jays game.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.549
I, uh... Got some great seats.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.152
A guy owed me, huh?
What do you say
we go down there,

04:14.288 --> 04:16.622
Get some brewskis,
a couple dogs, huh?

04:16.757 --> 04:19.691
- Yeah, no. No. Yuck.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.828
No. Gross.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.030
- Alright...
- I mean...

04:25.032 --> 04:27.265
- Yeah, nah, it's cool.
We don't have to...

04:27.268 --> 04:29.167
(muttering)
slow. I get that, I get that.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.169
Slow. I dunno,
whatever you're really into,

04:31.238 --> 04:34.706
I just feel like...
Oh, you got the earbuds in?
Okay, cool. Um, tell you what.

04:34.708 --> 04:39.311
I'm gonna handle this
and then I will see you...
Next time, next time.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.845
- Yeah.
- I'll see you next time.

04:52.393 --> 04:55.327
- No tail, right?
- Like a common toad.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.767
- So... How'd it go?

05:02.803 --> 05:05.337
- Just like you said.
Boat runs have been going
flawless the past few weeks,

05:05.472 --> 05:07.405
And now he's asking me
to do more.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.541
- Nice.
- Check it out.
It's a package drop.

05:09.610 --> 05:12.744
It's just a sample size,
but possibly for a new partner.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.813
- Okay, we can work with this.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.348
- Did he bite
on the baseball tickets?

05:16.417 --> 05:18.884
- No, it's like I offered him
a bag of hot garbage.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.887
- God-darn, we should've went
with the mma or burlesque.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.689
- How 'bout this?
I'm thinking pigeon drop.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.391
- Pigeon what?

05:26.526 --> 05:29.761
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but like in reverse, right?

05:29.797 --> 05:32.697
- Exactly.
Almost like a fiddle game.
- A fiddle game?

05:32.700 --> 05:35.600
What's a fiddle... A fiddling...
A game of...?
What's that?

05:35.602 --> 05:39.371
- It's just street rip stuff
from the old kelly and naz days.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.573
- Oh, street rips.
That's - pfft - cool.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.775
I'd love to learn.
Lay it on my, stu.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.778
- Uh, you know, guys?
I'll be right back.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.380
Enjoy your story time.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.821
- It's an engagement ring.
Because he asked her
to marry him.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.725
- Oh, my god! Lifesaver!
I thought I lost it!

06:00.794 --> 06:02.394
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you!

06:04.765 --> 06:06.564
Hold up. How'd you know
where to find us?

06:06.566 --> 06:09.701
- I told you not to put
your op details in your notes.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.603
- And I told you
to stop snooping.

06:11.672 --> 06:15.306
- Can you blame me,
with john forte hanging around?
(guffawing)

06:15.342 --> 06:16.808
He in there?

06:16.810 --> 06:19.610
- Nathan? No, no, he's not.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.546
And don't you mean "wyclef"?

06:22.783 --> 06:25.150
- John forte was the pretty one
in the fugees.

06:25.152 --> 06:28.620
- Ah, whatever, doesn't matter,
'cause I'm lauryn anyway.

06:28.755 --> 06:33.425

I'll see you at home.

I mean, there is so much fizzle.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.758
Hey, more stuff?

07:39.893 --> 07:43.962
- Yeah. I've been watching

07:44.097 --> 07:46.030
You know, I just figured
since I'm going away to school,

07:46.066 --> 07:47.865
It's probably a good time

- Mom! What? Don't poke.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.172
- Yikes.

07:55.742 --> 08:00.378
Oh, my bad, kiddo.
You know how I am before
I've had my morning juice.

08:00.514 --> 08:03.614
- The juice. Of course.
You know, it's totally fine.

08:04.751 --> 08:07.118
- Uh, listen, elliot.
Would you like to talk--

08:07.120 --> 08:11.456
- I... Don't.
I actually blocked her number,

08:11.525 --> 08:15.994
You know, 'cause it was getting
kinda too hard to ignore
the calls, so I just...

08:17.564 --> 08:19.731
...I'm just trying to--
- move on.

08:19.866 --> 08:22.200
(both): Yeah.
(sam sighing)

08:22.335 --> 08:25.603
- Well... Come on, bring it in.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.074
- Okay.
- No? That's... Good.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.808
Okay, I'll help you
move the bags.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.477
- Sweet.
- This one's heavy.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.816
- How can there be no leader?
- I'm not saying that,

08:38.852 --> 08:42.354
But it appears members
of different gangs are working
together as one entity.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.422
- They're all equal players,
like adam gentle said.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.490
Will french, niccolo,
marc the shark...

08:46.527 --> 08:50.428
- With everything we know
about gangs, does this seem
right to y'all?

08:50.564 --> 08:53.297
Nah. In the end,
there's always a top dog.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.966
- And what's the devil's
greatest trick?

08:56.670 --> 08:58.236
- Convincing you
he doesn't exist.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.104
- Well, let's trick 'em
right back.

09:00.140 --> 09:04.108
Let's give 'em
the old pigeon fiddle.
That's not... The fiddle pi...

09:04.144 --> 09:08.079
Fiddling pigeon drop...
The pigeon droppings.
The fiddle who loves... Pigeons.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.515
- I know what a pigeon drop is,
wazowski.

09:10.517 --> 09:14.252
- That was I was...
- But how does that apply
to the intel we got from naz?

09:14.321 --> 09:17.922
- Will scored a new partner.
- Yeah, but apparently,
he's a nervous nellie.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.991
Naz said that will's trying
to reel him in,

09:20.060 --> 09:22.861
So he fronted him
a small package to impress him,
just a few kilos.

09:22.996 --> 09:26.130
- Apparently, they've had
some issues with another crew
trying to pick off deliveries.

09:26.199 --> 09:29.300
Of course, they don't know
that we know that, so...

09:29.336 --> 09:32.270
We're gonna do something
that's crossed every cop's mind
at least once.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.072
Well, every cop, maybe,
except for wazowski.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.408
- What?
- Oh...

09:36.410 --> 09:38.743
- What?
- You mean you're gonna--

09:38.878 --> 09:42.246
- That's right. We're gonna
rip off some drug dealers.

09:43.417 --> 09:47.018
- Oh.
(stammering)
fun? No. Really?

09:47.087 --> 09:48.286
- Yeah.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.090
- Oh, excuse me.
- Hi.
- Hi. Yes, hello.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.826
Is there, like,
a manager in there? Like,
customer service or whatever?

09:55.862 --> 09:57.428
- Oh, weird. Technically--

09:57.464 --> 09:59.764
- Actually, forget it.
I just need to find taai nazeer.
Do you know him?

09:59.899 --> 10:01.766
- Oh, detective taai nazeer.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.035
- Yes, detective nazeer.
Is he in there?

10:04.071 --> 10:07.105
- Um... No, actually, he's not.
- Can you give him this?

10:07.174 --> 10:09.007
Tell him that angie
brought his mail,

10:09.142 --> 10:11.176
And that I'm his ex-wife,
not canada post.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.378
- Angie...

10:13.447 --> 10:16.313
Well, he really has been meaning
to update his address.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.916
It's just he has been so busy
kicking butt and taking names,

10:18.952 --> 10:21.052
And there's, like,
lots of names that just, yup...

10:21.187 --> 10:23.988
And just making loads
of arrests, and, uh,

10:23.991 --> 10:26.324
Commendations and more arrests,
and things of that nature,

10:26.326 --> 10:28.393
But I'm gonna be sure
to tell him about the mail.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.863
- Careful of that busted strap.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.806
- Okay, this has gotta look
and sound real to work.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.408
- Yep.
(sighing)

10:43.543 --> 10:46.744
Okay. So who's part
of our stick-up crew again?

10:46.780 --> 10:49.614
- Bob bloch and watts,
and that new kid
from drug squad, tom kruse.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.116
- Oh, it's pronounced "croos."

10:51.251 --> 10:53.752
"croos." anyway,
it's a good call,

10:53.754 --> 10:57.155
'cause bob and watts
are gonna have a hard time
not sounding like cops.

10:57.157 --> 11:01.492
- Yeah, kruse isn't grizzled and
jaded yet like the rest of us.
Oh, sorry. Cruise.

11:01.528 --> 11:04.028
- "croos."
- "croos."
- very good. That's very good.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.797
- Look, the point is,
we just gotta be on 'em
real quick

11:06.833 --> 11:09.767
Before they react
so it doesn't go left, okay?

11:11.071 --> 11:13.905
- You ever hear of cat people?
- Cat people?

11:14.040 --> 11:15.773
- It's a magazine
called cat people.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.775
I'm guessing it's for people
who love cats,

11:17.844 --> 11:20.111
But I also imagine there's a few
other ways that it could go.

11:20.113 --> 11:23.981
More importantly, it was amongst
a pile of mail today
that was dropped off for naz

11:24.017 --> 11:26.918
By... Angie.

11:27.887 --> 11:29.854
- Angie.
- Angie.
- Angie, angie?!

11:29.890 --> 11:31.523
- Angie, angie, angie.
- Wow!

11:31.658 --> 11:34.392
- I was passing by and she was,
like: "excuse me, do you have
customer service?"

11:34.527 --> 11:37.328
- Oh, my god, that is so angie!
I swear, if she end up in hell,

11:37.397 --> 11:38.863
She gonna ask to talk
to the manager.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.599
- It was really,
really horrible. Anyway, listen,
more importantly,

11:41.735 --> 11:44.068
Do you think it's weird
that naz hasn't updated
his address?

11:44.104 --> 11:46.471
Is that weird? Is that just me?
What is that?

11:46.540 --> 11:48.773
- Well, there's nothing
not "not weird" about naz.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.608
- That's true, he's pretty--
- weird.

11:54.614 --> 11:57.148
- We probably shouldn't
keep them waiting.
(phone ringing)

11:59.886 --> 12:03.554
- So wait, that cat magazine
was for naz, though?
- Yeah.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.624
(sighing)
(soft music playing)

12:08.562 --> 12:10.028
- Hey.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.730
- Hey, what's up?
- Nothing.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.336
But I need you to do something
with me tomorrow.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.805
(music stops)
tobin wants me to work,

12:20.841 --> 12:23.041
And he's asked me
to find some people.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.910
- Tobin? I thought you were done
with all of that!

12:25.912 --> 12:29.314
- He's giving me another shot.
Jackie, please, I need this.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.649
- Oh, yeah? Why?

12:31.651 --> 12:34.185
(clatter)
(laughter and chatter)

12:34.221 --> 12:36.821
- Look around. There's no room.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.057
I just need a bit of cash
to get my own place.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.859
- Man, look, I get it.
I totally get it.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.996
Like, me having to stay here
is not a flex,

12:44.998 --> 12:48.333
But there are other ways
to make money!

12:48.468 --> 12:50.935
- Oh, yeah? Like what?

12:52.539 --> 12:55.073
- I'm still trying...
I'm figuring that out right now.
- Mm-hmm.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.075
Well, you're not gonna do that
by stalking everett on viewpix
all day.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.878
- Elliot!
- Whatever.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.947
The jackie I knew
would never get stitched up
over some guy.

13:03.082 --> 13:04.749
What happened to you?

13:05.585 --> 13:07.285
- Nothing.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.254
I'm the same as I ever been.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.358
- No. Not true.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.359
The jackie I knew
always had my back.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.628
- And I still do, okay?

13:17.697 --> 13:19.097
I always will.

13:19.232 --> 13:22.533
- Then why not now, jacks?
Come on.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.376
- Regardless
of my personal feelings,

13:32.445 --> 13:34.913
I just want you to know
that I am there for you
as a colleague,

13:35.048 --> 13:38.783
Or for any bridesmaid,
more specifically, like,
a maid-of-honour-type duty,

13:38.785 --> 13:41.318
Should you opt
for that sort of thing.
I am there for you, okay?

13:42.022 --> 13:43.788
- Your personal feelings?

13:44.891 --> 13:46.391
I'm assuming this is about len?

13:48.261 --> 13:50.328
Shouldn't my personal feelings
be enough?

13:50.463 --> 13:54.499
Shouldn't how I feel about it
be all that matters?

13:54.501 --> 13:57.268
- Absolutely. That was the...
Eh! That was the really--

13:57.304 --> 14:00.071
- You know,
len was the one who told me
I should give you a break.

14:00.073 --> 14:03.908
Told me I should let you help me
when you try to,

14:03.910 --> 14:09.547
So I'm gonna do just that,
you know, despite your...
Personal feelings.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.816
- I got it, yep.
I should've chosen all my words
better.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.086
I'm gonna take those words,
I'm gonna ship those words
right out to sea.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.021
Look, there they go.
They're drowning.
I'm not gonna help you,

14:17.090 --> 14:19.357
Because you're bad words...
Duff?

14:19.359 --> 14:20.859
Order up. Two travelling.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.595
- Pizza's here, two toppings.
About to ring the bell.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.764
- Now.
- Ding-dong.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.835
(honking)
- hey, are you dumb?!

14:30.904 --> 14:33.204
Move your piece of crap
off the road!

14:33.339 --> 14:37.976
- Engine off!
Don't reach for nothing else,
or we light this sucker up!

14:39.279 --> 14:41.245
- Did you happen to write that
for kruse?

14:41.281 --> 14:45.449
- Mm. I'm no ava duvernay,
but I gave him a few things
to say.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.518
- That was very good, very real.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.320
- You know what I want!
Let's go!

14:49.455 --> 14:52.189
- Do you idiots realize
who you're dealing with
right now?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.592
- That don't mean anything
to me.
And it ain't gonna help you.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.028
So?
- Come on!
- It's in the back!

14:59.132 --> 15:00.932
- Please,
just stop dilly-dallying.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.034
- Shhh-shhh. Patience.
Just let it happen.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.609
- Whoa!
- Back up, guy.
- Take it easy, bro.

15:12.646 --> 15:15.813
- Hey! You let us on your way,
or your boy here's getting
a facelift!

15:15.849 --> 15:17.282
- Okay.
- Hey, back off.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.351
- Just take your foot
off the gas. It'll be fine.
- Shut your mouth.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.019
(tires screeching)

15:28.428 --> 15:32.630
- Alright, boys.
All outta dough.
Let's close up shop.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.099
- I have sex with that guy.
Yeah?

15:35.101 --> 15:36.867
Whoo! What a stud.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.869
Just, like, take that, angie.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.039
- Let's just hope
they bought it.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.779
To tell you that he's in
for a full order.

15:48.848 --> 15:51.849
- Forget that.
Talk about what you did.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.820
- What do you mean?
I did what you asked me to do.

15:55.889 --> 15:59.590
- Come on.
The guys told me what happened.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.793
Rambo.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.462
(laughing)
I mean, what were you thinking?

16:04.531 --> 16:07.131
- I dunno. Look,
I asked if they had a man below,

16:07.167 --> 16:08.933
And they didn't,
so I volunteered.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.668
- A man below, what's that?
- Nah, you see,

16:10.803 --> 16:12.670
When I used to do
my rochester runs,

16:12.805 --> 16:15.540
I'd always keep a man
below deck,
usually my cousin darla -

16:15.675 --> 16:20.678
Dangerous woman -
with a shotgun, 'cause,
you know, you never know.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.216
- You never know.
- And when you said you were
having trouble with this route,

16:25.285 --> 16:28.352
I said, "hey,
better safe than sorry."

16:28.355 --> 16:29.887
(laughing)

16:31.691 --> 16:33.290
- Wild man!
- Yeah.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.560
- Look, man.
I'm gonna be honest with ya.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.498
When doc griffin introduced us,
you...

16:41.634 --> 16:43.967
...You were not
what I was expecting.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.569
- I love the doc, I do.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.038
He plays,
y'know what I'm sayin'?

16:47.107 --> 16:49.841
But he doesn't really know
all there is to know.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.442
- Yeah,
I'm starting to see that.

16:51.577 --> 16:52.777
- Yeah.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.315
- I, uh...

16:57.450 --> 17:00.351
I'm having a party
for my sister.
It's her birthday.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.254
- Okay.
- My closest friends,
partners are gonna be there.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.391
I want you to be there, stu.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.061
As long as you promise
to dress up a little bit.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.196
(laughing)
- are you serious?

17:12.331 --> 17:14.898
I mean, that... That's amazing.
Yeah, thank you.

17:14.934 --> 17:18.136
- Okay, cool. Alright, man.
I'll holler at you
with the deets.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.604
- Word.

17:29.682 --> 17:33.151
- Stick-up crew, you crushed it.
Tom kruse, you're a natural.

17:33.286 --> 17:36.453
- Nice job, guys.
- Nice play. It worked. Alright.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.289
And now naz is on a guest list
at a party

17:38.424 --> 17:41.692
Where we hope he'll be able
to identify the head
of the snake, or the coyote.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.328
- Now, unfortunately,
the location is tricky.

17:44.364 --> 17:48.032
The vi-lounge is a terrace club
located on the eighth floor
of this building.

17:48.034 --> 17:51.235
Only one elevator and two sets
of stairs go to the club.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.170
- So naz will not be wired,
okay?

17:53.239 --> 17:55.373
So he's gonna be communicating
with us nonverbally.

17:55.508 --> 17:58.709
It's imperative that we keep
eyes on him whenever
and wherever we can.

17:58.711 --> 18:03.714
- And if he ids someone special,
he'll signal us by rubbing
his chin like this.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.716
- So if he's up there,
how do we see him?

18:05.852 --> 18:08.252
- Well, from the balcony
from across the lounge.

18:08.387 --> 18:10.321
It isn't the prettiest,
but it's the best view
available.

18:10.390 --> 18:14.058
Wazowski will run surveillance
from there, while I run ops
on the ground.

18:14.193 --> 18:15.760
- Drew the short straw,
wazowski?

18:15.762 --> 18:18.863
- I actually prefer
to be up there. My priority
is to keep eyes on naz.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.332
And besides, ds greene and I are
gonna make it the place to be.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.734
- Uh, about that.
I don't do heights.

18:23.870 --> 18:27.671
- You don't do heights? What...?
- No, it's the only thing
I'm terrified of.

18:27.740 --> 18:31.075
Well, that and twins.
Multiples of any ki...

18:31.144 --> 18:32.877
We're not talking about that
right now.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.679
- I'm a twin.

18:36.248 --> 18:39.683
(kelly): Okay, kruse,
go with wazowski.
You guys gotta be sharp,

18:39.719 --> 18:42.887
Do your job, and hey,
let's get lucky, okay?

18:45.158 --> 18:48.959
- So do you have, like...
Telekinetic abilities?

18:48.995 --> 18:50.661
(sighing)

18:53.500 --> 18:55.432
Did you hear that?
Did you read my mind?

19:00.173 --> 19:02.306
- Hey! "I'm gonna give you
a facelift?"

19:02.375 --> 19:04.108
Where do you come up
with this stuff?

19:04.243 --> 19:07.578
- I don't even know! You know,
it's like, when stu is on,
I'm just watching. It's weird.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.814
- Maybe stu can come for a visit
from time to time.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.183
You know, you could have
a fight club thing going.

19:12.318 --> 19:16.053
- Right? Nah, probably not,
though, still.

19:16.122 --> 19:19.157
I mean, where does it end,
right?
I mean, stu the other day,

19:19.292 --> 19:21.825
He was talking
about growing a moustache.
Maybe he does that! I dunno.

19:21.861 --> 19:25.862
- Uh... I'm gonna, like,
vote "no" to the moustache.

19:25.899 --> 19:28.332
You know what? It's your body,
so you can do with it
as you please.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.534
Listen, do you guys want to go
over checkpoints, hand signals.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.336
I have flash cards,
it's ready to go,

19:32.338 --> 19:33.870
They're right back here.
Is that something--

19:33.907 --> 19:36.974
- I got it all up here.
- He's got it. Or stu does.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.142
- How about home address?
Does that need updating?

19:39.179 --> 19:41.411
(kelly clearing throat)
- what was that?

19:41.447 --> 19:44.281
- No...Thing. 'twas a joke.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.149
- Okay.

19:49.956 --> 19:53.224
- Hey... It's for luck.

19:53.226 --> 19:56.627
(chuckling)
- right, 'cause it's your...

19:56.629 --> 19:59.530
Favourite restaurant and
the weirdest place you ever--

19:59.599 --> 20:02.599
- Wow.
- Oh! Oh.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.836
Y'all nasty.

20:12.278 --> 20:15.446
(sam): Put it up. Put it up.
(tom stammering)
you know what?

20:15.515 --> 20:17.648
Thank you, thank you,
I've got it, it's fine.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.917
You know what?
Thank you for your help,
but I'll just...

20:21.787 --> 20:23.720
(sighing)
(door closing)

20:23.756 --> 20:26.524
- How we looking?
- All set.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.225
Just waiting on stu.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.261
<i> (kelly): Tin roof,</i>
<i> what's the temperature?</i>

20:31.297 --> 20:33.831
- Uh, we are warm.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.334
Very warm. And we are hot.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.603
<i> (kelly): Just waiting</i>
<i> on happy cat.</i>
(exclaiming)

20:38.738 --> 20:40.938
- Yeah, got it. Ah.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.140
- Again, I don't mind
being on the ground with nathan

20:43.142 --> 20:44.742
If you want your partner up here
with you.

20:48.014 --> 20:51.215
- So we're just not gonna talk
about it, hmm?

20:55.955 --> 20:58.422
You're the only one
who hasn't weighed in yet.

20:58.557 --> 21:00.524
- Maybe I have nothing to say.

21:00.526 --> 21:02.392
- I find that hard to believe.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.398
- Okay, honestly?
- Yeah, honestly.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.036
- I wouldn't even know
where to start.
- How 'bout the truth?

21:12.171 --> 21:14.105
- Oh, the truth?
- Yes!
- Which one?

21:14.240 --> 21:17.308
The one about how len hurt you
badly in the past?

21:17.377 --> 21:19.977
Or how you vowed
never to get sucked in again?

21:20.112 --> 21:23.481
Or how I watch you change up
on all of that to the point
where now you're--

21:23.483 --> 21:27.451
- Really, nathan? I changed up?
You can't sit there
and say I changed up

21:27.586 --> 21:30.588
When once upon a time, you said
you were leaving gabrielle.

21:30.723 --> 21:34.191
- Yes! And you told me that
I could not do that at the time!

21:34.260 --> 21:36.026
- Well, could you have?

21:37.063 --> 21:40.497
(sighing)
- look, I-I don't want to fight.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.738
- Yeah. Me neither.
(sighing)

21:49.742 --> 21:51.675
(hip hop playing)

21:53.579 --> 21:57.214
- Unbelievable.
How is this the job?

21:57.250 --> 22:00.017
- I don't know.
He said come to work.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.886
How would I know he meant this?

22:03.089 --> 22:04.888
- You can't say
I don't have your back now.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.691
(hip hop playing)

22:10.229 --> 22:12.362
<i> (kelly): Alright,</i>
<i> happy cat is on the prowl.</i>

22:12.398 --> 22:13.630
- Copy.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.702
Oh my gosh, he's so hot.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.637
Happy cat is the pick
of the litter.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.246
- Stu! You made it!

22:29.248 --> 22:30.514
- Yeah.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.183
Hey, listen,
thanks for the invite.

22:32.318 --> 22:33.317
Very nice of you.

22:33.319 --> 22:35.252
- Yeah, man. Look, uh,
bar's over there.

22:35.321 --> 22:36.787
Get yourself a drink.
- Yeah.

22:36.823 --> 22:39.389
- And I will be right back.
- Alright, alright, alright.

22:39.425 --> 22:40.724
Okay.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.360
(indistinct chattering)

22:45.465 --> 22:46.864
(man laughing)

22:46.866 --> 22:48.132
Get a beer, please?

22:49.535 --> 22:52.103
- Ninety-nine percent of riders
are upstanding citizens.

22:52.238 --> 22:54.071
Charity, camaraderie.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.939
What, you never heard
of a teddy-bear drive?

22:55.975 --> 22:57.240
(laughing)

22:57.276 --> 22:59.477
- So what percentage are you?
- Does it matter?

23:00.680 --> 23:02.112
Name's shark, by the way.

23:09.422 --> 23:10.720
- Wow!

23:12.391 --> 23:16.293
If it isn't mr. Big...
Boat man himself.

23:16.295 --> 23:17.294
- Ha-ha.
- Hi.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.096
- Adeline, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.497
- Oh, thank you.
(adeline giggling)

23:20.533 --> 23:22.433
- It is my birthday, isn't it?
- It is, yeah.

23:22.435 --> 23:23.901
- Although it's kind of hard

23:24.036 --> 23:26.370
To tell in a room
full of will's friends.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.406
- I'm sure plenty of people
are here to see you.

23:32.511 --> 23:34.311
- I hope one of them is.

23:34.313 --> 23:35.579
(giggling flirtatiously)

23:40.719 --> 23:42.052
(tom chuckling)

23:44.724 --> 23:47.157
- Stu, my man, there's somebody
I want you to meet.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.060
Adeline, go, uh...

23:50.129 --> 23:51.662
Mingle with your guests.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.268
- Nice chattin' with ya.

23:58.304 --> 23:59.870
(suspenseful music)

24:01.307 --> 24:03.807
- This is an associate of mine.
I'd like to introduce you to--

24:03.876 --> 24:06.743
- Stuart. Heard a lot about you.

24:07.413 --> 24:08.546
You really stepped up.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.347
- Got a new stray in the litter.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.351
(camera shutter clicking)

24:14.420 --> 24:15.719
- I didn't catch your name.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.153
(chuckling)

24:18.224 --> 24:20.491
- How come all the other guys
around here

24:20.560 --> 24:22.025
Have never heard of you?

24:22.061 --> 24:23.360
- Oh, I like it that way.

24:24.363 --> 24:27.431
Because they don't know
who I know.

24:29.402 --> 24:31.234
(chuckling)

24:32.572 --> 24:34.705
- You see? I like that.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.106
There's too many other guys
around here

24:36.142 --> 24:37.607
Trying to make a name
for themselves.

24:38.744 --> 24:42.246
But trust me.
Anonymous is better.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.449
- Happy cat is scratching
the post.

24:45.518 --> 24:47.318
(camera shutter clicking)
I repeat,

24:47.453 --> 24:49.052
<i> Happy cat has scratched</i>
<i> the post.</i>

24:49.121 --> 24:50.787
(tablet chiming)
<i> incoming.</i>

24:55.327 --> 24:57.227
- I've never seen
this dude before.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.464
Maybe we get a lucky hit
from the database?

25:00.533 --> 25:01.932
Good kitty.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.634
Standby for treats.

25:06.973 --> 25:09.539
- I only come to this city
when I have to.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.942
It's not my cup of tea.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.944
- Maybe you just need
a better tour guide.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.013
I tell you what.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.614
I'll take you out
on the water sometime.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.089
(dance music playing)

25:26.125 --> 25:27.491
- It's not so bad, right?

25:27.560 --> 25:28.825
- I've had worse gigs.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.628
(adeline laughing)
- I'd love a hot dog!

25:30.630 --> 25:32.296
So much!

25:32.298 --> 25:34.431
- What are you doing?
- What... What do you mean?

25:34.433 --> 25:36.233
- You can't...
This is all for you.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.768
This is all for you--
- I love you.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.202
(laughing)

25:40.039 --> 25:41.671
- Yo, is that the birthday girl?

25:43.175 --> 25:44.774
If she's dipping out
on her own party,

25:44.810 --> 25:46.443
Then she's my new hero.

25:46.512 --> 25:48.846
- Rich people are weird.
- Mm-hmm.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.615
- I'm gonna circle, okay?
- Yeah, get it, girl.

25:52.351 --> 25:53.483
(gasping, exclaiming)

25:53.519 --> 25:54.684
(glass breaking)

25:57.323 --> 25:58.989
(hip hop music)

26:04.530 --> 26:05.663
- What are you doing here?

26:05.798 --> 26:07.531
- Dude, what are<i> you</i> doing here?

26:07.666 --> 26:09.333
- Seriously, keep it down.

26:09.468 --> 26:11.802
- Oh, you're undercover
right now?!

26:11.937 --> 26:13.870
(naz whispering): Easy, easy!

26:13.872 --> 26:16.206
Listen, you need to get
outta here right now.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.142
- I can't leave.
I'm here with a friend.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.943
- Then you both need to leave.
I'm serious.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.011
- Wh...?

26:21.814 --> 26:23.546
- I gotta go.

26:26.952 --> 26:28.552
- Who was that?
- Ugh!

26:29.589 --> 26:31.889
Nobody. That was nobody.

26:32.024 --> 26:34.157
- He's a cop.
I heard you say "undercover."

26:34.193 --> 26:36.092
- You don't know
what you're talking about, okay?

26:36.128 --> 26:38.561
- We have to tell somebody.
- No, we don't gotta do it.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.563
Okay? Actually. Actually?

26:40.600 --> 26:42.099
I think we should leave
right now.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.101
- You can go if you want.
I'm staying.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.506
- Ratting out that guy

26:49.575 --> 26:52.843
Is not gonna get you
brownie points, okay?

26:52.845 --> 26:55.846
You and I? We're the help.

26:55.915 --> 26:57.247
That's it.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.117
- We'll see.

27:03.322 --> 27:04.321
(sighing)

27:09.528 --> 27:11.061
(outgoing message tone)

27:12.131 --> 27:14.898
- Oh, come on, elliot,
please answer.

27:16.702 --> 27:18.268
(distant sirens)

27:20.739 --> 27:22.072
- Listen.
What I should've said--

27:22.207 --> 27:24.208
- No. Mm-mm.
- No, just wait--

27:24.210 --> 27:26.410
- I'm over it.
- Congratulations.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.812
Okay?

27:29.882 --> 27:32.215
I should've said,
"congratulations."

27:37.990 --> 27:39.423
- Thank you.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.962
- Is that car one of ours?

27:47.099 --> 27:49.667
- Uh, I don't think so.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.973
(hip hop music playing)

27:56.942 --> 27:58.709
(indistinct chattering)

28:08.721 --> 28:11.388
- I'm telling ya,
you scalp more on a Monday

28:11.523 --> 28:13.257
At les miz
than you do to seats

28:13.259 --> 28:14.524
To the friggin' world series.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.127
They go nuts for musicals
in this town.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.562
(laughing)
- this guy, this guy

28:19.598 --> 28:21.331
And his baseball.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.200
(sighing)

28:23.202 --> 28:24.668
- Hey. What do you say
it's about time

28:24.737 --> 28:26.603
You and I got down
to business, huh?

28:26.605 --> 28:28.739
- You've seen book of mormon,
right?

28:28.741 --> 28:30.340
- Ah...
- Dear evan hansen?

28:30.409 --> 28:31.875
- Are you kidding me right now?

28:31.911 --> 28:34.277
Wow! Yeah, of course!

28:34.313 --> 28:35.479
Waving through a window?

28:35.481 --> 28:38.148
I've never been the same
ever since, I tell ya.

28:38.283 --> 28:41.417
But for me, personally,
all-time favourite?

28:41.454 --> 28:43.887
It's gotta be... Fiddler.

28:44.022 --> 28:46.724
Right?
(vocalizing and laughing)

28:52.531 --> 28:54.097
(chuckling)

28:54.133 --> 28:55.699
- Well, stuart,
looks like it's gonna be

28:55.834 --> 28:57.200
Business after all.

28:57.269 --> 28:59.569
- Huh. Yeah, okay.

28:59.605 --> 29:02.372
Well...
It's nice chatting with ya.

29:02.374 --> 29:05.175
And maybe next time, uh,
I'll actually catch your name.

29:05.310 --> 29:06.810
- You should join us.

29:06.879 --> 29:08.845
Might be some room
for some new blood.

29:09.582 --> 29:11.714
- Really? I mean, yeah.

29:11.751 --> 29:13.984
I mean, I would just love
to be a fly on the wall.

29:14.053 --> 29:17.587
- Um, actually, business should
just be between members only.

29:17.623 --> 29:19.423
- I'd like stuart to join us.

29:20.726 --> 29:22.458
(tense music)

29:24.196 --> 29:25.529
(sighing)
- uh...

29:29.034 --> 29:31.201
(tom): Uh, sam, I've lost him.

29:31.237 --> 29:33.169
Maybe he's in the bathroom.

29:34.206 --> 29:37.107
- I don't like this.
I want eyes on him.

29:38.343 --> 29:39.409
- You're just jealous
because he was flirting

29:39.545 --> 29:40.677
With that hot girl.
- Okay, that's enough chitchat.

29:40.746 --> 29:42.846
We don't even... Gimme that.
I'm gonna do this.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.380
And don't touch
my sunflower seeds.

29:47.085 --> 29:48.652
(tense music)

29:51.123 --> 29:52.556
Still nothing.

29:53.559 --> 29:54.825
- Ninety seconds past check-in.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.627
When do we start
getting worried?

30:01.700 --> 30:05.168
- First one that you ever saw
in person, you remember?

30:05.171 --> 30:07.704
- Yeah, sure, sure. Annie.

30:07.706 --> 30:11.909
My mother took my sister and I
to go, uh, check it out.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.444
Back row, obstructed view,
still amazing.

30:14.446 --> 30:17.447
- Hmm. For me,
it was chorus line.

30:17.516 --> 30:18.882
You know that one?

30:18.884 --> 30:20.650
- No, no, I don't think
I know that one.

30:20.686 --> 30:23.253
- Huh. Well, I'm older than you.

30:23.388 --> 30:26.723
Older and...
Maybe a little bit wiser.

30:26.725 --> 30:28.157
(awkward laughter)

30:29.428 --> 30:31.094
- Yeah.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.796
So is this, uh,

30:32.931 --> 30:35.732
Normally where you guys
come to, uh...

30:35.801 --> 30:39.736
Talk business?
- Well, you know what they say.

30:39.872 --> 30:42.005
And... Curtain.

30:42.140 --> 30:43.507
(grunting)

31:02.027 --> 31:03.693
(phone buzzing)

31:07.766 --> 31:10.566
- Jackie?
- Sam, I am so sorry.

31:10.603 --> 31:12.168
I tried elliot,
but he's not answering.

31:12.238 --> 31:15.973
- Okay, what's wrong?
- I'm at this party,

31:15.975 --> 31:18.575
And that guy you work with
is here.

31:18.644 --> 31:22.112
Um, naz, taai naz.
Whatever his name is.

31:22.181 --> 31:26.116
<i> Um, listen, there are some...</i>
<i>Kind of bad guys at this party,</i>

31:26.118 --> 31:27.951
And I'm not sure
they're supposed to know

31:27.953 --> 31:31.087
That he's a cop,
but I think that they do.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.358
- Okay, jackie, listen to me.
Do you see him?

31:34.493 --> 31:35.792
Do you see naz?

31:35.794 --> 31:38.728
- No. I tried to look for him,
but I-I don't see him anymore.

31:38.764 --> 31:40.630
- Okay, don't hang up,
don't hang up, don't hang up.

31:40.633 --> 31:41.731
Just keep looking for him.

31:41.767 --> 31:44.935
Hey, do you have a 20 down there
on happy cat?

31:46.372 --> 31:48.405
- No, we don't see him.
What's wrong?

31:49.275 --> 31:51.207
<i> - We have a serious problem.</i>

31:51.277 --> 31:52.943
(distant sirens wailing)

31:52.945 --> 31:54.911
(indistinct chattering)

31:56.215 --> 31:59.282
Police!
Everybody stay where you are!

31:59.351 --> 32:01.084
- Nobody in or out.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.654
(indistinct radio chatter)

32:06.925 --> 32:08.692
- Where's the buyer?

32:08.694 --> 32:10.160
(officer): Sir, you can't leave
right now.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.230
- All clear in there.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.832
- There's no one over there,
either.

32:15.868 --> 32:18.067
Duff, where the hell
did they go?

32:21.573 --> 32:23.306
T all he told you?

32:23.375 --> 32:24.974
- Yeah. Then he told me
to leave.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.576
- He didn't say
he was going anywhere?

32:26.645 --> 32:28.712
- Database req came back.
You need to see this.

32:28.847 --> 32:31.448
Bishop logan.
Looks like a cartel boogeyman.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.050
The rest is vague.
That scares me.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.617
- Jackie,
what time did you get here?

32:34.687 --> 32:37.220
We have people on all entrances
and no one saw you come in.

32:37.222 --> 32:39.188
- We got in at 3:00.
We used the elevator.

32:39.224 --> 32:41.124
- Again, we would've seen you.

32:41.259 --> 32:43.560
- Jackie, you did
the right thing by calling me.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.128
I can't stress that enough.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.596
But an officer's life
is in danger,

32:46.665 --> 32:48.998
So I need you
to think real hard.

32:49.034 --> 32:50.367
- I know. I know, sam. Look.

32:50.436 --> 32:52.502
All I know is we all used
the same elevator.

32:52.571 --> 32:55.639
Vip, staff, everybody.
It's the same elevator.

32:55.774 --> 32:57.541
But we got off the floor below
and used the stairs

32:57.543 --> 32:58.941
Because it doesn't go up
all way.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.079
(distant sirens wailing)

33:07.619 --> 33:09.652
(groaning)

33:11.824 --> 33:15.425
- Hey-ho! You're awake.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.561
(breathing heavily)

33:19.498 --> 33:21.597
Yah!
(crying out)

33:24.636 --> 33:26.903
You still want to know my name?

33:28.107 --> 33:30.374
- Kind of ceased to care!

33:30.509 --> 33:32.175
(gasping)

33:36.281 --> 33:37.948
- He just has clubs
in the trunk?

33:38.083 --> 33:39.749
- Always.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.853
- Wait, wait, wait. Wai...

33:44.890 --> 33:48.524
You... You're the boss, huh?
The coyotes?

33:48.560 --> 33:50.527
You're...
You're the man in charge?!

33:51.463 --> 33:53.463
(grunting, glass shattering)

33:53.499 --> 33:54.965
Fore!
(naz panting)

33:55.100 --> 33:57.600
The boss? Me?

33:58.237 --> 33:59.869
Nah.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.471
I'm merely an instrument.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.474
Think of me as a...

34:04.609 --> 34:06.342
An auditor.

34:07.345 --> 34:09.312
They send me
where the trouble is.

34:10.249 --> 34:12.181
- Are they the cartel?

34:12.684 --> 34:14.051
- W-w-wait.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.487
What are we doing here?
I mean, this guy,

34:17.622 --> 34:21.625
Uh, he... Drove a boat for me
a couple of times.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.526
He doesn't know anything.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.563
- Yeah, well,
we're just about to find out

34:26.632 --> 34:28.431
What the truth is, will.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.902
Did you know
that I wanted to turn pro?

34:33.772 --> 34:35.972
I have a two handicap.

34:36.041 --> 34:36.873
(grunting)

34:36.942 --> 34:38.775
(naz crying out)

34:38.910 --> 34:40.510
(groaning)

34:44.349 --> 34:46.683
(distant siren wailing)

34:46.685 --> 34:48.585
Could do with some
better lighting in here.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.387
I was aiming for his head.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.989
- Yeah, well,
I didn't... Buy this place

34:53.058 --> 34:56.326
To be a... Country-club
driving range.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.728
I mean, this is to wash money.

34:58.730 --> 35:02.065
I mean, mostly kids
sneak in here to drink.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.200
(groaning)

35:03.335 --> 35:05.835
- You can take pride
in anything, will.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.872
Maybe that's why
they sent me here.

35:08.941 --> 35:12.074
- Yeah? Well, they're wrong.

35:12.111 --> 35:14.344
Because I have this
under control.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.550
- You sure about that?

35:21.353 --> 35:22.752
(panting)

35:22.888 --> 35:25.421
- Why is there a utility
elevator we didn't know about?

35:25.457 --> 35:27.023
- The building plans
we saw must be

35:27.092 --> 35:28.157
From before it was installed.

35:28.193 --> 35:29.759
- Which is why
we didn't see them.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.094
They took the stairs
down one floor

35:31.229 --> 35:32.362
To an elevator
we didn't know existed.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.163
- That only exits here.
- Which means they must've had

35:34.199 --> 35:35.731
A car parked
around here somewhere.

35:36.368 --> 35:38.201
(panting)

35:40.372 --> 35:42.405
- Hey.
- Is that the...?

35:43.374 --> 35:45.041
- Yeah. They got rid
of anything

35:45.110 --> 35:46.309
On him that looked
like a tracking device.

35:46.444 --> 35:48.644
- Or naz dropped it on purpose.

35:49.882 --> 35:51.748
Come on, come on, come on.

35:52.350 --> 35:54.083
Look.

35:54.153 --> 35:56.219
Maybe he dropped it so we could
see where they took him from.

35:56.354 --> 35:58.321
- Get the make of that car, too.
- Okay, let's go.

35:58.456 --> 36:00.590
- This is ds greene.
I need access to cctv footage

36:00.592 --> 36:02.459
From a service room
beneath the vi-lounge!

36:05.730 --> 36:08.932
(will): Okay, enough, enough.
Enough. I'm calling it.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.134
Alright,
if you're gonna do him...

36:11.904 --> 36:13.636
Then do him already.

36:15.874 --> 36:18.008
- I got three balls left.

36:19.678 --> 36:22.278
I'm almost out... Detective.

36:24.216 --> 36:25.482
(will): Detective?

36:25.617 --> 36:28.518
(panting)
- and after that...

36:28.653 --> 36:31.520
I'm afraid
there's no more games.

36:34.459 --> 36:35.792
(crying out)

36:35.861 --> 36:38.561
(groaning)

36:38.564 --> 36:40.096
Get him up!

36:40.832 --> 36:42.432
I got two balls left.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.435
- Yeah.
- Tell me tech got something.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.504
- We were able to track the car
to weston and oak.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.072
Already called it in,
but we're still the closest

36:49.074 --> 36:50.674
Ones to it.
- Let's go.

36:53.412 --> 36:54.944
(panting)

37:00.385 --> 37:01.751
(naz grunting)

37:01.886 --> 37:03.620
(man screaming)

37:05.123 --> 37:06.756
- Get him.

37:12.364 --> 37:13.663
(gunfire)

37:15.701 --> 37:16.766
(gun clicking)

37:17.669 --> 37:19.202
(panting)

37:24.142 --> 37:26.108
(sirens wailing)

37:27.279 --> 37:28.944
(gunfire)

37:28.981 --> 37:30.646
(indistinct radio chatter)

37:31.850 --> 37:33.683
- Cover the north exit!
Tell backup to cover

37:33.685 --> 37:34.751
The south when they get here!

37:34.820 --> 37:37.821
(will): Bishop, we gotta
get outta here. Come on.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.826
- Police!

37:42.828 --> 37:44.427
Naz!
- I'm here!

37:44.562 --> 37:46.596
- Show me your hands.
Show me your hands!

37:46.665 --> 37:48.965
Get your hands up.
- Naz!

37:49.034 --> 37:50.833
- I'm here! Go, go!
They're at the side door!

37:50.869 --> 37:52.001
- Get naz!

37:52.037 --> 37:53.837
(breathing heavily)

37:53.972 --> 37:55.638
(groaning)
- oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

37:55.641 --> 37:56.706
- It's okay.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.042
Listen...

37:59.111 --> 38:00.910
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't know what to do.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.579
I didn't have time to think.

38:02.714 --> 38:05.715
I just reached into my pocket
and I saw... I saw the canoe.

38:05.850 --> 38:07.817
- It was perfect.
Whatever you do is perfect.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.185
- Hey, no sign,

38:09.187 --> 38:11.254
But we got teams
out looking everywhere for 'em.

38:11.389 --> 38:12.922
(kelly): Goddammit.

38:13.358 --> 38:14.990
You okay?

38:15.761 --> 38:17.193
- Yeah, I'm okay.
(panting)

38:17.329 --> 38:18.928
I think I'm...
I think I'm done

38:19.064 --> 38:20.864
With undercover work for now.

38:20.999 --> 38:24.200
Okay? And golf.

38:24.269 --> 38:25.835
I hate golf.

38:37.149 --> 38:38.748
I should've called it off
as soon as they got on the roof.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.817
- I got the blueprints
to the building.

38:40.886 --> 38:42.618
I should've known
they predated that elevator.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.954
That's on me.
- Look, there's plenty of blame

38:45.023 --> 38:46.489
To go around.

38:46.624 --> 38:48.858
I'm responsible
for letting them get by us.

38:48.993 --> 38:51.026
Shoot, can you imagine
what would've happened

38:51.063 --> 38:52.361
If jackie didn't call you?

38:52.397 --> 38:53.696
- Jesus.

38:54.599 --> 38:55.632
Jesus. I know.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.600
- They were willing
to shoot a cop tonight.

38:59.104 --> 39:03.038
That's what they're capable of,
so we need to turn up the heat.

39:03.075 --> 39:04.674
- Yeah, yeah.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.976
Guys, I gotta go check on naz.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.513
- Kelly.

39:11.616 --> 39:13.516
- I'm gonna get started
on the paperwork.

39:13.651 --> 39:14.918
See you back at the station.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.986
- Your people arrested
marc tremblay tonight?

39:17.122 --> 39:18.521
- Yeah, and a bunch
of other people,

39:18.523 --> 39:19.955
But I don't care about that now.

39:21.626 --> 39:22.926
(sighing)

39:23.061 --> 39:24.794
- Naz doing okay?

39:25.564 --> 39:27.063
- Hmm.
- Listen, listen.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.598
I already put word out.

39:28.667 --> 39:31.000
I'm gonna help y'all
find will, okay?

39:31.036 --> 39:33.069
- Were you following me today?

39:34.139 --> 39:36.673
- What?
- Were you following me today?

39:36.675 --> 39:38.107
I saw your car.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.142
- Oh, you did?

39:40.178 --> 39:41.144
- Yeah.
- Where?

39:41.146 --> 39:42.945
- Near my op.
(len chuckling)

39:43.014 --> 39:45.415
- Okay, you saw my car,
or a car that looked like mine?

39:45.484 --> 39:46.883
'cause I know I don't gotta
explain to you

39:47.018 --> 39:48.684
How uc cars are supposed
to look like every--

39:48.754 --> 39:51.086
- You still did not answer
the question.

39:51.123 --> 39:52.522
(sighing)

39:52.657 --> 39:55.324
- No, kelly,
I was not following you.

39:56.728 --> 39:57.961
(huffing)

39:57.963 --> 40:00.095
(indistinct pa announcement)

40:00.132 --> 40:01.698
(sighing)

40:01.833 --> 40:04.367
- I'm tired.
It's been a long day.

40:04.369 --> 40:06.102
- I thought we were past this.
- I know,

40:06.237 --> 40:08.905
But you followed me before,
you've done that before.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.774
How am I supposed to know?
- I'm not that guy anymore!

40:10.909 --> 40:12.308
- But how--
- haven't I shown you?

40:13.678 --> 40:16.913
(sighing)
oh. Okay, you know what?

40:16.915 --> 40:20.015
Show my picture to the doorman
at crazy eight pool hall.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.917
He'll let you know
I was there all day.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.553
- Wh-why would you even...?
Len.

40:31.963 --> 40:33.797
- You really didn't
have to come.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.932
- Uh, I kind of did.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.334
I mean, I'm still
your emergency contact.

40:38.336 --> 40:40.469
What would I look like
if they called to tell me

40:40.505 --> 40:42.739
You were hurt and I was just,
like: "mm-hmm."

40:42.741 --> 40:44.007
- Yeah, that'd be...
That'd be pretty bad

40:44.142 --> 40:45.341
If you did that.
- Yeah.

40:45.343 --> 40:46.543
(laughter)
- ah, jeez.

40:46.545 --> 40:47.543
- Ooh, ooh. Okay, be careful.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.612
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Yeah?

40:49.648 --> 40:51.147
- I'm alright.

40:53.618 --> 40:57.420
Angie, I'm sorry I didn't update
my emergency contact.

40:57.555 --> 40:59.489
And my mailing address.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.625
I know you've left me
some messages.

41:02.760 --> 41:05.594
- No, no, it's... It's okay.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.897
Maybe I was just looking
for an excuse to call.

41:09.834 --> 41:12.869
But I get it.
It looks like you've been busy.

41:12.938 --> 41:15.238
Kicking ass and taking names,
right?

41:15.240 --> 41:17.974
- Wrong. Um, I've been
getting my ass kicked.

41:18.043 --> 41:19.175
(angie laughing)
but okay, sure.

41:19.177 --> 41:20.609
- Yeah.

41:22.848 --> 41:24.314
I miss you.

41:25.050 --> 41:26.716
You know that, right?

41:28.787 --> 41:30.320
- Angie, uh--
- can we just go for dinner

41:30.455 --> 41:33.188
This week, maybe? Just talk.

41:33.225 --> 41:35.424
I mean, once you're outta here.

41:40.432 --> 41:41.731
- Yeah, sure.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.332
- Yeah?
- Of course.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.007
(soft music)

41:55.747 --> 41:57.379
(kissing)

41:58.984 --> 42:00.482
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Okay.

42:00.519 --> 42:01.884
- Okay.

42:07.225 --> 42:08.691
(sighing)

42:09.961 --> 42:11.427
- Any of the units out looking
for will and bishop

42:11.563 --> 42:13.229
Report back yet?
(sighing)

42:13.231 --> 42:15.431
- No, not yet.
They're in the wind.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.437
- It wasn't a total loss.

42:21.506 --> 42:24.440
- This gang,
it doesn't make sense to me.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.609
Everything fast and loose,

42:26.611 --> 42:29.145
Will calling the shots one day
and then this guy showing up?

42:29.214 --> 42:31.581
Mm-mm. Doesn't jive for me.

42:31.716 --> 42:34.317
- Either way,
it's the best lead we have.

42:34.452 --> 42:35.851
We just need to find 'em.

42:39.958 --> 42:41.858
- My money's on adeline.

42:41.993 --> 42:44.227
That's gonna be the first person
that will reaches out to.

42:44.229 --> 42:45.662
- Mmm.
- Okay.

42:46.498 --> 42:48.097
Until we figure out a play,

42:48.166 --> 42:49.832
We need to keep this tight.

42:49.834 --> 42:51.134
Just us three.

42:51.269 --> 42:53.135
(kelly): Mm.
- Four.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.840
You should play this
close to the vest, though.

42:59.010 --> 43:01.444
But you booked
marc the shark tonight.

43:04.282 --> 43:06.282
So now you got me.

43:13.425 --> 43:14.957
(sighing)

43:15.026 --> 43:17.093
Subtitling: Difuze
