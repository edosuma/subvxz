Where have you been? We're at DEFCON 1.
It's DJ's 40th birthday.

01:05.607 --> 01:09.444
I was prepping. Okay,
I've got tissues, a bottle of wine...

01:10.153 --> 01:11.613
her favorite ice cream...

01:12.947 --> 01:14.324
another bottle of wine...

01:15.575 --> 01:18.912
and more ice cream in case
she doesn't like the first ice cream.

01:20.288 --> 01:24.501
So basically you used DJ as an excuse
to buy yourself two kinds of ice cream.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.586
And wine for you.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.423
Ah, you don't need an excuse for that.

01:30.507 --> 01:35.428
Look, it's her 40th. There is no telling
how sad and depressed she's gonna be.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.349
Hey, everyone! I'm 40!

01:43.394 --> 01:45.647
Sweet cheese. She's worse than I thought.

01:46.439 --> 01:49.317
What? I'm fine.
In fact, I have been up since 5:00 a.m.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.860
I took back-to-back spin classes,

01:50.944 --> 01:53.071
and I finished
Tommy's birthday card to me.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.240
I even spelled it "birfday" like he does.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.494
Aren't you a little sad, though?

01:59.577 --> 02:01.955
I was really looking forward
to some morning wine.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.457
No. Life is great.

02:04.541 --> 02:08.002
The vet clinic is booming,
my family's healthy and--

02:08.086 --> 02:09.796
[sing-song] You wanna marry Steve.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.675
You admitted it to Matt
in the mayor's office.

02:13.758 --> 02:14.968
No takesies backsies.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.347
Oh, I am really regretting
telling you guys.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.766
But now I know more than ever

02:21.850 --> 02:24.936
that Steve is the person
I want to spend the rest of my life with.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.023
Nothing like
a tranquilizer-induced conversation

02:29.107 --> 02:31.109
to get clarity on who your true love is.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.360
Mm.

02:34.362 --> 02:37.240
Well, happy 40th, Deej.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.534
Oh, I hope I look this great when I'm 40.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.416
We're the same age.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.752
[sing-song] Not according to Facebook.

02:51.296 --> 02:55.633
I have a delivery
for the most beautiful girl in the world.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.677
Aw, thanks, Steve.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.762
But I think you should give those to DJ.

03:00.471 --> 03:04.434
Oh, they're beautiful
and my favorite--gardenias.

03:05.768 --> 03:09.480
Speaking of favorites, you know how
<i>Amazing Race </i>is your favorite show?

03:09.564 --> 03:11.482
Still <i>Million Dollar Listing </i>but sure.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.862
Good enough, because today,
it is girls versus guys,

03:15.945 --> 03:19.240
in DJ's Amazing Race: Birthday Edition.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.283

A competition and an outfit?
You know me so well.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.833
Ooh, and it's the breathable cotton
I like so much.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.335
Oh, yeah, that's pure Pima.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.963
Organic, locally sourced,
handpicked in small batches.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.092
Is getting through
this boring conversation about cotton

03:38.176 --> 03:39.302
the first challenge?

03:40.595 --> 03:43.306
Okay, so the race will begin and end
here at the house,

03:43.389 --> 03:46.351
-and if you make it to the end--
-Why wouldn't we make it to the end?

03:46.434 --> 03:48.603
Are there alligators?
Why would you do this to us?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.565
Relax, okay. There's no alligators,

03:52.649 --> 03:54.692
but, uh, but if you make it to the end,

03:54.776 --> 03:58.363
I have a surprise for you
that's gonna make you love me forever.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.033
I'm gonna let the guys know
the race is on.

04:02.116 --> 04:04.410
Don't tell them, but their shirts
are 10% polyester

04:04.494 --> 04:06.287
and a little flammable.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.165
Did you pick up on that, Kimmy?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.167
I am way ahead of you, Steph.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.710
Pick up on what?

04:12.794 --> 04:14.671
[both] Steve is gonna propose!

04:17.757 --> 04:21.052
What? No. What gave you that idea?

04:21.135 --> 04:24.931
Come on. A surprise at the end of the race
that's gonna make you love him forever?

04:25.014 --> 04:28.726
-What else could it be?
-Guys, he's not proposing. It's too soon.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.187
And Steve and I are fine. I'm fine.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.337
I did.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.173
It is one of my duties as captain.

05:00.633 --> 05:04.095
It will take unprecedented teamwork
to win this race.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.723
-Well, us ladies have been a team forever.
-Mm-hmm.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.434

a major butt-kicking.

open 'em and let the race begin.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.411
Oh, Deej, I hate to ruin your birthday,

05:28.494 --> 05:32.498

because I'm an <i>Amazing Race</i>-ist.

-It says...

06:13.456 --> 06:15.666
we have to create a team name.

-Wait, wait. Uh...

-Okay, the name of the next challenge

06:31.307 --> 06:34.769
-is "Here Comes the Ride."
-Ahh. "Here Comes the Ride"?

06:34.852 --> 06:37.605
Come on, could Steve
be any more obvious about proposing?

06:37.688 --> 06:40.316
Well, he could've called it
"Here Comes the Proposal."

06:41.317 --> 06:43.486
Guys, it's just the name
of the next challenge.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.904
Steve is not proposing.

Okay, the three of us
must ride a tandem bike

Where DJ's the boss?

06:54.914 --> 06:57.417
This house?
Because she's pretty bossy around here.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.378
True. Oh, maybe it's the park?

07:00.461 --> 07:03.005
You know how she likes telling people
to move along.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.468
Speaking of that, have you ever seen her
at the supermarket express lane?

07:07.552 --> 07:10.638
-Ach.
-I'm sorry, but if it's ten items or less,

07:10.721 --> 07:12.390
you should be doing the math
ahead of time.

-That's great. Let's go.
-Hold up.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.975
We should have a name
that represents all of us.

How about "The Dudes"?

The Dudes, The Brohams,

maybe I wanna pick the name?

how to smoke.
