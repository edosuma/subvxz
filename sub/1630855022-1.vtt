00:12.095 --> 00:13.847
What are you waiting for?

00:19.228 --> 00:20.270
Give it a whirl.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.009
- <i>Happy Birthday...</i>
- <i>Happy Birthday...</i>

00:51.009 --> 00:54.054
Hold on a second. Who's--

00:54.054 --> 00:57.057
- <i>...Dusty</i>
- <i>...Dad</i>-

00:57.057 --> 01:03.522
- <i>Happy Birthday to you</i>
- <i>Happy Birthday to you</i>

01:05.232 --> 01:06.859
- Aah! I got 'em all.
- Yay!

01:07.609 --> 01:08.819
What did you wish for?

01:08.819 --> 01:10.070
I totally forgot to do it.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.488
You didn't make a wish?

01:11.488 --> 01:13.949
Hey, with a family like this,
what else could I need?

01:14.741 --> 01:15.951
That's fucking dumb.

01:15.951 --> 01:17.911
So you want me to return
your 40 presents now?

01:18.495 --> 01:20.706
I got 40 presents? Get 'em!

01:20.706 --> 01:22.457
Let's move this along.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.211
- Original trail mix.
- Wow.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.254
A new headlamp!

01:27.254 --> 01:28.547
Batteries.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.299
- That's better.
- Okay, honey.

01:31.842 --> 01:34.052
What's in here? What are you eating?

01:36.471 --> 01:38.640
A shirt that's funny
and also makes me feel bad.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.142
I'm really proud of it.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.518
Four dollars...

01:42.311 --> 01:44.104
- stapled together.
- Love you, Dad.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.858
A scooter! Shut up!

01:47.858 --> 01:51.612
Oh, my God, yeah. That is the perfect gift
for a fully grown adult man!

01:51.612 --> 01:53.780
And look, it even comes with a camo helmet

01:53.780 --> 01:56.241
because you're practically military
now that you drive a scooter.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.493
- Kinda.
- Okay. You can go to school now.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.661
Thank you.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.246
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.248
Thank you, Tri.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.502
- Look at this! You are amazing.
- Look at-- You're just so cute.

02:06.502 --> 02:08.711
You're gonna be amazing on it.
I can't wait to see you.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.839
I'm gonna sit with it. Get used to it.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.924
Okay.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.176
Okay.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.387
This is a surprise!

02:19.431 --> 02:21.016
- Too much.
- All right.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.185
Ready?

02:26.605 --> 02:29.316
Ooh. Wow. Look at that.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.986
It's-- It's a-- It's a--

02:32.986 --> 02:33.987
It's a theremin.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.113
- A theremin.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.367
It's this old-timey musical instrument
that uses electromagnetic waves.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.952
You don't even have to touch it.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.621
- Did I ask for that?
- No.

02:42.621 --> 02:43.747
No.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.542
Just figured you might like it
because you're so musical.

02:46.542 --> 02:47.793
You're always whistling.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.670
Are you surprised?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.380
You've outdone yourself, darling.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.715
Yay. And you know that's not it, right?

02:54.466 --> 02:56.009
It wouldn't be your birthday

02:56.510 --> 02:59.429
if I didn't have another little surprise
for you when you get home tonight.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.306
- Oh, my goodness.
- Mm-hmm.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.767
Cassandra Hubbard, it's not even Thursday.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.435
I know.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.481
Whoo. Shit.

04:00.866 --> 04:02.701
Hey! Morning, Izzy.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.495
Ooh, I think you mean,
''Good morning, Mayor Fontaine.''

04:05.495 --> 04:07.706
That is what I meant.
Thank you for correcting me.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.001
Dusty! I see you got a new hog.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.378
- She's a sweet ride.
- Yeah.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.047
All she needs is a bit of rocket fuel.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.089
- Okay.
- Two milks, one sugar, please.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.800
It's on the house, birthday boy.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.552
My secret's out.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.221
I'm turning 21.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.832
I see you noticed my new toy.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.211
Believe it or not,
for the two bucks you saved on coffee,

04:54.211 --> 04:57.089
that thing will tell you
your life's potential.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.134
Is that right? Where'd you get it?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.261
No idea.

05:02.261 --> 05:05.138
Jacob was manning the store
when it arrived on Friday.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.933
But a lot of people used it
over the weekend,

05:07.933 --> 05:12.938
and it seems to be good for business,
so I'm not asking questions.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.525
What do you think, Mr. Malik?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.360
Best two bucks you ever spent?

05:47.556 --> 05:49.433
Jimbo!

05:50.225 --> 05:54.104
Morning, Larry. Morning, Lisa!

05:57.524 --> 06:00.527
Hey, Jamie! Hey, Jamie C!

06:00.527 --> 06:03.780
Hi, Jasmine. Ooh, new hair, I like it.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.327
Hi.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.121
Hi. How you doing?

06:12.122 --> 06:13.123
Hiya.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.960
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey, nice scooter, birthday boy!

06:16.960 --> 06:18.504
Thank you. You can borrow it!

06:18.504 --> 06:20.589
- I'ma hold you to that.
- Maybe.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.760
- Hey, what's happening?
- Mr. Hubbard! Ay, check it out.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.889
Guess who's gonna be
your next great "Meteorologist."

06:29.765 --> 06:31.391
I see someone's been to Mr. Johnson's.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.268
What-- Axel, is that your life potential?

06:33.268 --> 06:35.938
That's right. And according to the MORPHO,

06:35.938 --> 06:38.649
I'm gonna be building
your rocket ships one day.

06:38.649 --> 06:41.151
That's not even close
to what a meteorologist is.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.487
He probably just made the card himself.

06:43.487 --> 06:44.821
- Aha! Boom.
- Wha-- No!

06:44.821 --> 06:46.698
You see, who needs a silly machine?

06:46.698 --> 06:49.493
Savannah just proved her potential
as a criminal prosecutor.

06:49.493 --> 06:53.330
No, no, no. Jacob! Jacob was there.
He saw me do it.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.708
Jake. Jake, come on. Back me up.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.338
I think it's bullshit.

07:01.839 --> 07:02.840
All right.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.386
Let's check our language
and open our textbooks.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.722
I believe we were discussing the wives
of Henry VIII.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.893
Let's try and get through them
a little quicker than he did.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.397
He got through them pretty quick.
Doesn't make sense.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.114
I like it. No.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.992
So, if you wanna know
if it's gonna rain tomorrow,

07:29.992 --> 07:33.036
all you gotta do is call up
my worst student, Axel.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.580
Maybe I will, okay?

07:35.163 --> 07:36.164
Who knows?

07:36.164 --> 07:39.334
Maybe this will inspire Axel to actually...

07:39.334 --> 07:41.295
What? To become a meteorologist?

07:41.295 --> 07:44.256
Or just believe in himself.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.758
You know, Nat,
she got ''Storyteller'' on her card

07:46.758 --> 07:49.595
and said it felt like someone
reached into her soul

07:50.095 --> 07:53.015
and articulated her secret dream.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.933
I don't think you're allowed
to call it a secret dream

07:54.933 --> 07:56.852
if you constantly tell people
you're a storyteller.

07:57.728 --> 07:59.104
The woman just likes to gossip.

07:59.104 --> 08:02.399
Okay, yes,
but how does the machine know that?

08:02.399 --> 08:03.734
It's clearly a scam.

08:03.734 --> 08:06.528
You're only hearing about it
from people who got a good life potential.

08:07.112 --> 08:11.825
Nobody's gonna tell you if they got
"Third Best Garbageperson in Deerfield."

08:13.118 --> 08:14.703
That's what you got, isn't it?

08:14.703 --> 08:16.079
What about you?

08:16.079 --> 08:18.081
What do you think
your life potential would be?

08:19.249 --> 08:22.544
<i>Happy, happy celebration
It's your special day</i>

08:22.544 --> 08:26.757
<i>We're so glad you came
And brought your family today</i>

08:26.757 --> 08:33.722
<i>At Giorgio's Italian Restaurant
And sports center</i>

08:34.597 --> 08:38.059
<i>You'll always be
In the happiest mood</i>

08:38.059 --> 08:43.857
<i>'Cause we bring endless fun
And endless foods</i>

08:44.608 --> 08:45.817
Yay!

08:45.817 --> 08:47.736
That was really nice. That was really ni--

08:47.736 --> 08:50.531
It just-- It didn't feel
like the entire staff was singing.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.200
I understand that, yeah.
It feels like this little section here.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.953
- This section avoiding eye contact.
- So quiet.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.204
Why did you have to come here?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.747
We came for the ''endless fun

08:58.747 --> 09:00.916
- and the endless foods.''
- Endless foods.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.212
All right. Back to work, people.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.756
She doesn't know that we're her parents.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.801
You don't recognize
it's your mum and your dad.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.177
From your house!

09:12.177 --> 09:15.222
- We made you!
- Yeah! Trina!

09:15.222 --> 09:16.306
We love you!

09:16.306 --> 09:18.892
- Hey, hey, hey. What can I say?
- Hey!

09:18.892 --> 09:20.686
It's hard to find good help these days.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.521
Must be something in her genes,

09:22.521 --> 09:26.650
and I know it's not coming from Cass,
so I'm looking over here!

09:26.650 --> 09:28.443
Okay, Giorgio.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.153
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.698
We're having fun.
We're having a little bit of fun.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.033
Kid's got potential.

09:35.033 --> 09:38.120
Speaking of,
you two tried this MORPHO machine?

09:38.120 --> 09:40.664
- Oh, my God.
- We were just talking about that.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.291
You wanna know what I got?

09:42.291 --> 09:43.375
''Superstar.''

09:44.877 --> 09:46.420
Is that spooky or what?

09:46.420 --> 09:48.505
I was legitimately spooked.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.340
- That's spooky as shit.
- That is scary.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.717
I don't know if you two remember,

09:51.717 --> 09:54.052
but I was the first
Italian-American goalie

09:54.052 --> 09:55.637
in New York Rangers history.

09:55.637 --> 09:56.805
And the youngest.

09:56.805 --> 09:59.349
- How would we not remember that?
- It's printed on the menu.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.935
I was brimming with potential

10:01.935 --> 10:04.980
until I suffered a permanent injury
to my catching hand

10:04.980 --> 10:08.817
- while I was dead-lifting over 465 pounds.
- Yeah, yeah, we know the story.

10:08.817 --> 10:11.528
- How much were you lifting though?
- But if it wasn't for that, I guess,

10:11.528 --> 10:13.447
- I wouldn't have this place...
- Hey.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.991
...which is also a lifelong dream.

10:15.991 --> 10:19.203
Yeah, so, I guess,
as that spooky machine can attest,

10:19.203 --> 10:22.331
''Superstar'' can mean a lot
of different things, Big D.

10:23.457 --> 10:24.708
Dusty won't try it.

10:24.708 --> 10:25.834
Really?

10:26.418 --> 10:28.212
What? Why not, bro?

10:28.212 --> 10:30.297
You don't have something
you always wanted to be?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.966
Some secret ambition or talent?

10:32.966 --> 10:35.219
Ooh. Dusty is a really good whistler.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.263
Among other secret talents.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.766
A good whistler. Wow.

10:40.766 --> 10:43.894
Cass is a lucky woman.

10:43.894 --> 10:49.483
And you, my friend, are a very lucky man.
I've been saying this since high school.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.151
To end up with this one?

10:52.277 --> 10:55.948
Maybe that's your life potential,
''World's Luckiest Man.''

10:56.573 --> 10:58.408
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.369
I think I have everything I ever wanted.

11:00.369 --> 11:02.079
Maybe you didn't want enough.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.337
Enjoy your night, you two.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.715
- Hey, play some of the games, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.385
- Get it now, babe. Whoo!
- Yeah, yeah. Every time.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.265
Shit! Watch out.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.768
- I think it's the form. You hot?
- I need to let loose here.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.479
- Yeah, it's too restrictive.
- Yeah, yeah. Let loose, babe.

11:29.523 --> 11:30.357
Babe!

11:30.357 --> 11:32.734
- No, I'm all right.
- Zero points.

11:38.282 --> 11:39.491
- Fuck.
- Ooh!

11:44.538 --> 11:46.623
- Is that-- Is this all you got?
- Yes.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.668
Yeah. I think there might have
been something wrong with your machines.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.795
- It's broken. It was broken.
- Definitely.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.131
Congratulations. You won a pencil.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.966
Thank you.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.551
I feel really special.

12:07.186 --> 12:08.937
Maybe I've got
more than one hidden talent.

12:09.521 --> 12:10.647
You ever thought about that?

12:10.647 --> 12:12.900
A couple times, I've thought about it.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.277
What about me?

12:15.277 --> 12:18.614
You? You were amazing.

12:19.948 --> 12:20.991
Best you've ever had?

12:22.117 --> 12:24.870
You're the only one I've ever had.
So, yes.

12:32.044 --> 12:33.295
Dusty?

12:34.671 --> 12:36.381
You think you can fuck me again?

12:39.218 --> 12:40.260
What was that?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.098
You think you can fuck me again?

12:46.183 --> 12:47.267
Definitely I can.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.520
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.357
You want me to--
You mean like before, but just again?

12:54.024 --> 12:55.025
Yeah.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.445
- That's new.
- Uh-huh.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.738
You mean right now?

13:00.364 --> 13:01.281
If you can.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.574
I definitely can, yeah.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.576
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I can get that done for you, baby.

13:04.576 --> 13:07.246
- Okay. I got you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.790
Just relax, baby.

13:10.499 --> 13:12.042
Mm-hmm.

13:19.508 --> 13:22.135
You know what, I actually don't know
if I can right this minute.

13:23.512 --> 13:24.972
- Okay.
- I'm sorry. It's just--

13:24.972 --> 13:27.307
- I had that second piña colada.
- It's okay.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.935
And part of me
thought it might have been a nightcap.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.854
It's okay. I was just kidding.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.315
Yeah, 'cause we just did it.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.654
Cass?

13:41.697 --> 13:42.990
You can whistle?

13:45.075 --> 13:46.743
Yeah.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.480
What the fuck?

14:25.532 --> 14:26.658
Who you texting?

14:27.326 --> 14:28.452
No, I wasn't.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.454
I was just waiting for breakfast.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.750
Sorry. No more pancakes.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.293
Your special day is over.

14:48.430 --> 14:51.558
<i>It's not like I'ma join a biker gang,</i>

14:51.558 --> 14:53.435
you know? But let me tell you something.

14:53.435 --> 14:56.522
Ever since I was a little girl,
I always wanted to ride.

14:56.522 --> 14:58.190
So if nothing else,

14:58.190 --> 15:03.111
maybe this machine is letting me know
that maybe I wasn't so crazy.

15:03.612 --> 15:04.905
Or maybe I am!

15:05.572 --> 15:08.158
I just blew my whole retirement fund
on a brand new Harley.

15:10.035 --> 15:12.162
Look at Father Reuben,

15:12.162 --> 15:15.040
he's like, "Principal Pat,
you're a crazy motherfucker!"

15:16.375 --> 15:17.876
Is that what you're thinking, Father?

15:17.876 --> 15:19.837
All right, look. I think it's natural

15:19.837 --> 15:23.006
to wanna believe in something
that might be too good to be true.

15:23.006 --> 15:27.636
Like, when Dawn Caswell said
she saw the face of God in her hydrangeas.

15:27.636 --> 15:30.013
But, like I said to Dawn,

15:30.764 --> 15:32.391
what were you looking for?

15:46.655 --> 15:47.656
Don't worry.

15:47.656 --> 15:50.409
I was third on my team in rebounds, so...

16:06.300 --> 16:08.635
<i>A crowd of onlookers gathers</i>

16:08.635 --> 16:13.265
<i>to watch the Queen Mary
named at the commission of George V</i>

16:13.265 --> 16:16.310
<i>after the kingdom's greatest...</i>

16:16.894 --> 16:18.312
<i>At Westminster Abbey,</i>

16:18.312 --> 16:21.607
<i>an even larger crowd
witnesses the coronation</i>

16:21.607 --> 16:24.735
<i>of George VI and his wife Elizabeth,</i>

16:24.735 --> 16:29.990
<i>as king and queen of the United Kingdom
and the Dominions of British Commonwealth</i>

16:29.990 --> 16:32.701
<i>and as emperor and empress of India...</i>

16:33.619 --> 16:34.494
Shh.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.455
<i>...ascended the throne</i>

16:36.455 --> 16:40.083
<i>upon the abdication of his brother, Edward.</i>

16:41.293 --> 16:43.378
Jacob! J-Pop! Wait up.

16:45.297 --> 16:48.634
- Hey.
- Mr. Hubbard. How was your birthday?

16:48.634 --> 16:52.930
Yeah. It was pretty shakin'. Shakin' jams.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.682
I don't think that's an expression.

16:55.682 --> 16:59.520
Anyway, I just wanted to say
we've got a lecture coming up on Henry I,

16:59.520 --> 17:04.775
and if you wanted to sit it out,
that's totally fine.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.819
It involves brother-on-brother violence.

17:07.819 --> 17:11.198
So, I was just a bit concerned
it might be triggering for you.

17:11.198 --> 17:15.077
I don't think it will be
since I didn't kill my brother.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.037
And he also wasn't a king, so...

17:17.954 --> 17:19.790
Good points. Well-spotted.

17:19.790 --> 17:21.625
And also, I wanted to say that

17:21.625 --> 17:24.377
even though people aren't talking
about what happened to Kolton,

17:24.377 --> 17:26.505
it doesn't mean that everyone's forgotten.

17:26.505 --> 17:27.881
Hope you know that.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.716
I can't imagine what you're going through

17:29.716 --> 17:33.470
and juggling all of that
and coming back to school

17:33.470 --> 17:36.515
and your job at Johnson's.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.017
Yeah.

17:39.726 --> 17:40.853
That must've been weird,

17:41.353 --> 17:43.605
when you were working your shift
the other day

17:43.605 --> 17:45.941
and this frigging MORPHO machine turns up.

17:45.941 --> 17:49.027
- I don't wanna talk about the MORPHO.
- No, me neither. No, me neither.

17:49.027 --> 17:52.197
Don't-- Everybody's like,
''Where did it come from?''

17:52.698 --> 17:53.740
"Who cares!"

17:53.740 --> 17:55.617
Not me. I couldn't give two hoots.

17:55.617 --> 17:56.994
I couldn't give one hoot.

17:57.995 --> 17:59.788
I'm surprised Mr. Johnson
doesn't care, though.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.665
If I'm honest, it feels strange.

18:01.665 --> 18:04.793
I feel like if five pinball machines
turned up in his store,

18:05.711 --> 18:08.088
- he'd wanna know where they came from.
- I don't know, Mr. Hubbard.

18:08.589 --> 18:10.424
No, nobody seems to know.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.928
- I should really get back to class. So...
- Yeah. No, same. Totally.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.556
Hey, how did you know it was my b-day,
by the way?

18:17.556 --> 18:18.640
Trina told me.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.518
Are you two in classes together
this semester?

18:23.020 --> 18:26.690
She dropped most of her classes, so... no.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.401
That's right.
She dropped most of her classes.

18:33.739 --> 18:35.532
<i>I think we need to talk about Trina.</i>

18:35.532 --> 18:38.035
Are you aware that she's been
dropping most of her classes?

18:38.619 --> 18:40.829
- That's not ideal, is it?
- Dusty, come on.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.415
She's been through a lot.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.210
I know. I know that. I just--

18:46.210 --> 18:49.087
I don't want her taking advantage
of the situation, or whatever.

18:49.671 --> 18:50.964
- Taking advantage?
- Yeah,

18:50.964 --> 18:54.384
if it's gonna affect her down the line.
This is a really important year for her.

18:54.384 --> 18:55.469
Okay.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.472
You don't want her to take advantage
of the fact her boyfriend died?

18:58.472 --> 19:00.057
Is that what you think she's doing?

19:00.057 --> 19:02.518
No. I don't know what she's doing.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.937
She used to share everything with us.

19:04.937 --> 19:06.980
And now I feel like
I don't know anything anymore.

19:09.483 --> 19:10.484
What's wrong with that?

19:11.318 --> 19:14.947
Maybe you don't need to know
everything that's going on with everyone.

19:15.697 --> 19:19.326
Maybe people want
some things that are just for them.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.539
That's a weird and upsetting thing to say.
You all right?

19:24.248 --> 19:25.290
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:26.542 --> 19:27.709
'Cause you seem a little off.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.671
- Off? I seem off?
- Not "off" off, just--

19:30.671 --> 19:34.007
- What is that?
- Not off. Not off, just not on.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.304
- Is it about this machine?
- No.

19:40.430 --> 19:41.431
Did you use it?

19:42.391 --> 19:43.433
No.

19:44.101 --> 19:46.603
- Are you unhappy?
- What does that even mean?

19:48.730 --> 19:51.066
Are you unhappy in this life?

19:57.614 --> 20:00.325
Can you put your stuff away, please?

20:00.325 --> 20:03.620
I wanna use my heat-press.
And I just need space.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.207
Okay.

21:14.441 --> 21:17.861
<i>The study of history
is the study of change.</i>

21:20.239 --> 21:23.325
We investigate not only what happened,
but when it happened,

21:23.325 --> 21:25.953
where it happened, and why it happened.

21:27.371 --> 21:30.249
<i>Castles are built, battles are fought...</i>

21:31.375 --> 21:33.418
<i>governments and laws are overturned.</i>

21:33.418 --> 21:35.379
<i>But nothing happens overnight.</i>

21:40.467 --> 21:42.553
<i>Tensions simmer and boil.</i>

21:43.053 --> 21:46.765
<i>Conflicts ebb and flow,
the tide is gradually turned.</i>

21:52.688 --> 21:55.899
<i>And what might have seemed
like a sudden, and shocking change,</i>

21:57.651 --> 21:59.069
<i>through the lens of history...</i>

22:02.656 --> 22:04.283
<i>seems all but inevitable.</i>

22:09.621 --> 22:10.831
You're late for class!

22:29.641 --> 22:30.976
Hey, hey.

22:33.645 --> 22:34.646
What are you doing?

22:34.646 --> 22:38.025
Dude, why don't you just open it up,
so we can see how you did it?

22:38.025 --> 22:41.403
You think I could make this thing?
I can barely use my phone.

22:41.403 --> 22:44.198
Nobody touches it, okay?

22:46.408 --> 22:47.451
You want a refund?

22:51.288 --> 22:52.331
Here's your refund.

23:06.178 --> 23:07.346
How did you do that?

23:08.805 --> 23:12.184
I have been saving
my childhood magic books my whole life.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.354
Until I used this machine...

23:18.148 --> 23:19.942
...I never knew why.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.320
Now, who wants to go next?

23:28.283 --> 23:29.868
<i>No one who changed history</i>

23:29.868 --> 23:32.913
<i>needed a little blue envelope
to tell them what to do.</i>

23:32.913 --> 23:36.708
<i>They made mission statements,
and they believed in themselves.</i>

23:36.708 --> 23:40.504
<i>They worked hard in the steady pursuit
of their goals, and they took control.</i>

23:40.504 --> 23:41.880
<i>They didn't throw everything away</i>

23:41.880 --> 23:45.300
<i>and just put all of their faith
in some random outside force.</i>

23:45.300 --> 23:46.760
Excuse me, Mr. Hubbard.

23:46.760 --> 23:50.013
I don't mean to interrupt,
but where you going with this?

23:50.013 --> 23:53.392
Yeah, it's kinda weird that you've
written this down.

23:54.852 --> 23:55.978
It's called a lecture.

23:55.978 --> 23:58.564
I-- I'm gonna tell you
where I'm going with this.

23:58.564 --> 24:00.107
I want everybody to pull out paper.

24:00.107 --> 24:01.942
Can you do that for me?

24:01.942 --> 24:04.111
We're gonna write two things on it.

24:04.111 --> 24:08.031
On one side, I want you to write, "I am,"

24:08.657 --> 24:13.954
and on the other, "I will be."

24:16.999 --> 24:19.751
You're going to decide
your own life potential, folks.

24:21.170 --> 24:23.755
What are you now? What are you gonna be?

24:25.299 --> 24:27.801
What about you, Mr. Hubbard?
What are you gonna be?

24:42.691 --> 24:43.901
Dusty Hubbard.

24:43.901 --> 24:47.070
It's been a while since I've seen you
in here. What can I get ya?

24:48.447 --> 24:50.240
Something hard.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.325
No, a beer.

24:51.909 --> 24:53.202
All right.

24:57.039 --> 24:58.540
Hey, Father.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.959
What are you doing?
Confessions over there?

25:05.672 --> 25:07.633
Bottoms up to ya.

25:12.471 --> 25:13.764
That's good.

25:15.307 --> 25:16.475
What percent is that?

25:17.142 --> 25:18.435
- Of alcohol?
- Mm-hmm.

25:18.435 --> 25:19.895
It's probably a 4.5.

25:20.521 --> 25:22.356
It's good. It's hoppy.

25:23.232 --> 25:24.233
It shouldn't be.

25:29.738 --> 25:30.739
Hang on.

25:30.739 --> 25:35.911
Father, I do, actually, have a little
bit of a confession, if you don't mind?

25:37.412 --> 25:40.123
- You can come-- No.
- I'm just sorry. I'm sorry.

25:40.123 --> 25:43.085
I'm sure you don't wanna talk shop.

25:43.710 --> 25:47.965
I have a student
who has started developing

25:49.424 --> 25:54.847
some weird blue marks on his... rectum?

25:56.139 --> 25:59.101
- On his rectum?
- I don't know the medical term.

26:00.269 --> 26:01.854
Anus-cheek. Whatever.

26:01.854 --> 26:05.023
Anyway, I wondered what you might advise?

26:05.816 --> 26:07.442
First I would advise your student

26:07.442 --> 26:10.487
not to show his ass or his rectum
to his teachers.

26:10.487 --> 26:11.947
He didn't show me his ass.

26:12.865 --> 26:14.491
He just described it for me.

26:15.492 --> 26:16.994
No, that's not--

26:16.994 --> 26:20.664
I'm gonna be honest with you, Father.
It's my own ass that I'm talking about.

26:22.207 --> 26:23.041
So...

26:23.041 --> 26:26.128
In that case, I would advise you
to see a doctor.

26:26.128 --> 26:28.130
No, I would, of course,

26:28.130 --> 26:30.716
except, the only doctor in Deerfield
happens to be my mother.

26:31.341 --> 26:35.804
I don't know if I'm in the right place to
reintroduce my mother to my bare bottom.

26:35.804 --> 26:36.972
Hey.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.892
Sorry, just gotta clear plates here.

26:40.726 --> 26:41.852
Get this out of the way.

26:42.728 --> 26:44.396
- Thank you, Hana.
- Yummy beer.

26:45.564 --> 26:48.692
Dusty, I'm kinda off the clock right now,

26:48.692 --> 26:51.069
so if it's a medical concern, you s--

26:51.069 --> 26:52.654
It's not just a medical concern.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.783
It's about this stupid machine
at Johnson's store.

26:56.783 --> 27:00.078
I'm sorry. I don't know why
it's bothering me so much.

27:00.078 --> 27:02.956
It's not like I really believe
there's a magical machine

27:02.956 --> 27:05.501
that can tell people
what they're capable of.

27:05.501 --> 27:09.046
But, come on, literally
everyone is trying it.

27:09.046 --> 27:11.965
- Not everyone is trying it.
- Okay, not everyone is trying it.

27:11.965 --> 27:14.259
But you know what I mean.
Everyone who is trying it

27:14.259 --> 27:18.263
seems to be making some pretty drastic
life changes because of it.

27:18.263 --> 27:19.473
It's weird.

27:20.474 --> 27:23.268
I just feel like
I've already done my big life change.

27:24.311 --> 27:26.021
When my mother brought us from Ireland,

27:26.021 --> 27:27.606
it took a bit of getting used to,

27:27.606 --> 27:30.859
but I got used to it,
and now I just want to enjoy it.

27:30.859 --> 27:32.653
This was it. This was--

27:33.737 --> 27:36.615
This was the next chapter
in my life story.

27:38.492 --> 27:40.869
So, you think a book
only has two chapters?

27:41.453 --> 27:45.707
No, no. Not good books, anyway.

27:49.002 --> 27:50.420
But what happens next, then?

27:52.089 --> 27:53.924
I'm 40 years old.

27:54.925 --> 27:57.970
Weird shit has started appearing
on my body.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.347
I could just drop dead at any minute.

28:00.848 --> 28:03.684
I have no discernible talents,
other than whistling.

28:04.184 --> 28:06.228
And I've only ever been
in one relationship.

28:07.604 --> 28:08.605
Yeah, me too.

28:09.815 --> 28:14.027
- With God.
- Right.

28:15.988 --> 28:18.740
You know what Kierkegaard says
about anxiety, Dusty?

28:19.867 --> 28:22.744
Yeah, yeah.
But I'd love to hear your take on it.

28:23.245 --> 28:26.331
He says that anxiety came
before original sin.

28:27.916 --> 28:32.129
When God told Adam not to eat the apple,
Adam felt anxiety,

28:32.921 --> 28:36.550
because he realized, for the first time,
there was another option.

28:36.550 --> 28:39.052
He realized he had a choice.

28:41.221 --> 28:42.431
And this machine,

28:43.849 --> 28:46.059
whether it's magic or not,

28:46.059 --> 28:50.564
is reminding people that our lives
have more than one possible path.

28:51.523 --> 28:53.108
Which is scary.

28:53.108 --> 28:57.196
The same way as it's scary
to walk to the edge of a cliff.

28:58.697 --> 29:01.867
Because you already know
that you could stay exactly where you are,

29:01.867 --> 29:03.035
or you could...

29:04.536 --> 29:09.333
throw yourself off into the deep unknown.

29:12.878 --> 29:16.798
And you know it's up to you.

29:24.848 --> 29:26.433
Good old Kierkegaard.

30:40.215 --> 30:41.717
What are you waiting for?

30:47.264 --> 30:48.307
Give it a whirl.

32:38.709 --> 32:39.751
Is it good?

32:42.296 --> 32:43.297
Are you happy?

32:47.092 --> 32:48.552
Fuck it!

32:52.681 --> 32:53.682
Fuck it.

33:04.151 --> 33:05.194
Dusty?

33:06.737 --> 33:10.866
Are you okay?

33:10.866 --> 33:11.992
I will be.
