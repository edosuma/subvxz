WEBVTT

00:09.635 --> 00:12.138
I have
a bad feeling about him.

00:12.138 --> 00:14.306
He's playing us like a fiddle.

00:14.306 --> 00:15.975
We can't trust him.

00:15.975 --> 00:17.810
You think he let
himself be captured

00:17.810 --> 00:18.894
intentionally?

00:18.894 --> 00:20.646
He shot Travis in the face.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.399
He's the only way
we get to Hitler.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.362
Two days ago,
you wanted to disappear.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.906
Now you want to stay?

00:31.907 --> 00:36.579
You said, if we find Hitler,
it absolves everything.

00:37.580 --> 00:39.623
All our failures. All our sins.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.667
I'll lead you right to him.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.173
I swear.

00:47.173 --> 00:49.550
Can we trust you, Joe?

00:51.761 --> 00:52.928
Trust me?

00:56.056 --> 00:59.393
They fucking abandoned me!

01:00.394 --> 01:02.146
They never even looked for me!

01:03.773 --> 01:07.526
And you're wondering
if you can trust me?

01:15.326 --> 01:17.536
Clara, Clara,
Clara, stop. Listen.

01:17.536 --> 01:19.163
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

01:19.163 --> 01:20.581
- What, what, what, what?
- Anything at all.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.333
What could you possibly say?

01:23.417 --> 01:26.086
I know, I know you're scared.
I know you're scared.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.923
Look, those people,
those people were monsters.

01:28.923 --> 01:31.300
- You think it's them
that scare me?
- They're monsters.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.302
It's you.

01:33.302 --> 01:36.555
I saw you, I saw
what you're capable of.

01:36.555 --> 01:37.765
What are you talking about?

01:37.765 --> 01:40.017
Those men were Nazis,
Clara, actual Nazis.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.644
- Real Nazis.
- No, I know, I know.

01:41.644 --> 01:43.479
And-and the police
should be called.

01:43.479 --> 01:45.815
Or the courts
or the press

01:45.815 --> 01:47.233
- or the military...
- They know!

01:47.233 --> 01:50.986
They all know.
And they've done nothing.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.696
Nothing! Do you understand?

01:52.696 --> 01:56.158
That's... the whole...
that's the point.

01:57.535 --> 01:58.452
This...

01:58.452 --> 02:00.830
This is why I have to...

02:00.830 --> 02:02.915
- Kill people by your own hand?
- Nazis!

02:02.915 --> 02:05.251
I hunt them down
and I kill them.

02:05.251 --> 02:08.003
Because if not me, then who?

02:10.214 --> 02:13.425
I... I kept it from you.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.219
I kept it from you.
That was wrong.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.470
All right?

02:16.470 --> 02:19.849
But it's only because
it's almost over.

02:19.849 --> 02:22.101
- Over?
- Yes. That's it.

02:22.101 --> 02:23.811
- Just one more, and it's done.
- One more...

02:23.811 --> 02:24.812
kill?

02:24.812 --> 02:27.398
One more. I promise.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.611
You think I like doing this?

02:32.611 --> 02:34.989
From what I saw today...

02:36.365 --> 02:38.158
...I actually do.

02:40.119 --> 02:42.079
What you saw today

02:42.079 --> 02:45.332
was me doing whatever necessary
to fucking save you!

02:45.332 --> 02:46.959
I saved me!

02:46.959 --> 02:50.629
By appealing to another
person's humanity.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.756
Not by stealing it
from them in cold blood.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.216
You chose violence.

02:54.216 --> 02:56.719
No, I chose justice while the
whole world looks the other way.

02:56.719 --> 02:57.720
But guess what. We can't.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.846
We...

02:59.847 --> 03:01.390
...won't.

03:01.390 --> 03:04.351
We don't have the choice,

03:04.351 --> 03:07.354
the luxury of just looking
the other way like you do.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.863
Did you really...

03:15.863 --> 03:18.449
murder a child...

03:18.449 --> 03:19.950
in Spain?

03:30.294 --> 03:31.837
It was an accident.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.006
Oh, my God.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.466
This Nazi used his own grandson.

03:35.466 --> 03:37.176
Your sweet soul.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.969
- It's still here.
- No, no, no.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.971
- It's gone.
- It's still here.

03:40.971 --> 03:44.725
It's gone. And of all
the terrible I saw today...

03:44.725 --> 03:47.645
...that was
the worst.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.021
That was the worst.

03:49.021 --> 03:51.565
Stop, Clara, stop,
stop, please.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.025
- This is one more.
- No...

03:53.025 --> 03:55.235
- It's almost over.
- No, it's not. That's a lie.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.612
I'm not lying to you.

03:56.612 --> 03:59.531
I know. I know.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.492
But you're lying to yourself.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.582
I can't marry a murderer.

04:08.582 --> 04:13.045
- I can't love a monster.
- Listen to me.

04:17.174 --> 04:19.677
Clara, please. Clara. Clara.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.095
Clara!

05:51.018 --> 05:53.896
 <i>An SS roll lists</i>

05:53.896 --> 05:57.191
a Matthias Kern,
unaccounted for.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.817
I saw a Matthias Kern

05:58.817 --> 06:00.402
in the INS files.

06:00.402 --> 06:01.779
Yes, here.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.335
You all right, Ruthie?

06:17.419 --> 06:19.922
Just fine. Thank you.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.804
We may have something.

06:26.804 --> 06:29.556
I spoke with a former
colleague at MI6.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.725
She believes
the agency have located

06:31.725 --> 06:33.977
HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer Pietr Hartmann.

06:33.977 --> 06:34.978
Hartmann?

06:34.978 --> 06:37.773
And Linus Rounds.
Elgar Wittbeck.

06:37.773 --> 06:38.816
Gunther Domshron.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.734
- Jackpot.
- Well, it would be

06:40.734 --> 06:42.736
had they not been found
in the Buenos Aires morgue.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.905
- What?
- Seven mysterious deaths

06:44.905 --> 06:47.533
of elderly German nationals
over the past four months

06:47.533 --> 06:48.951
in Buenos Aires.

06:48.951 --> 06:50.327
Argentinian authorities

06:50.327 --> 06:52.079
are keeping it mum.

06:52.079 --> 06:56.250
Do you think there's a band?
Like ours? Hunting Nazis?

06:56.250 --> 06:58.836
My contact
believes it's one man.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.712
A lone wolf.

07:00.712 --> 07:04.341
Wiping these Nazis out and
leaving not even a fingerprint.

07:06.510 --> 07:09.888
He could have a trove of
information that could unlock

07:09.888 --> 07:11.598
everything for us.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.481
So we travel to South America.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.651
And we find this lone wolf.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.325
Told you
she'd be a problem.

07:30.325 --> 07:31.702
She's just shaken.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.704
And what about you?

07:33.704 --> 07:36.415
Were you shaken the night
your grandmother was murdered?

07:36.415 --> 07:37.875
Did you run?

07:37.875 --> 07:41.795
As I understand it, you turned
that grief into action.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.757
It is not faith that
separates you from Clara.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.302
It's character.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.601
Are we...

07:56.602 --> 07:58.270
Are we monsters?

08:01.982 --> 08:05.027
Help me lay her down.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.029
Roxy.

08:07.029 --> 08:09.156
Easy, easy.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.200
Rox. Rox, are you okay?

08:11.200 --> 08:13.619
- They got
the bullet out.
- Give her room.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.788
- Yeah, do you need anything?
You all right?
- What do you need?

08:16.788 --> 08:19.958
Nothing.
Yes, I'm fine, I'm fine.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.838
- What the fuck?
- Lonny...

08:24.838 --> 08:26.590
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

08:29.051 --> 08:31.470
- Put it down!
- Lonny,
put the gun down, okay?

08:31.470 --> 08:32.679
Put it down and we'll explain.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.015
He killed Georges.
He tried to kill Roxy,

08:35.015 --> 08:38.393
and for some reason
he's still fucking breathing.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.145
He's our only way
of getting to Hitler.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.855
Do you understand?

08:43.607 --> 08:44.983
All right.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.653
I'm gonna shoot Joe now.

08:47.653 --> 08:48.946
- Please.
- Lonny, stop.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.633
Look at what you did to me.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.140
Do you know how long
I looked for you?

09:17.140 --> 09:19.184
How many months
I scoured the city?

09:19.184 --> 09:23.230
How many VA hospitals I visited?

09:24.398 --> 09:28.318
I knew you wouldn't just leave.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.490
- Roxy.
- No.
- No, no, Roxy.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.616
He tried to kill you.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.994
It wasn't him.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.878
I'm sorry.

09:50.382 --> 09:52.092
We must move quickly.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.721
When Joe doesn't return,
Hitler will know that his men

09:55.721 --> 09:56.930
failed him.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.849
He'll be waiting for us
with an army.

09:58.849 --> 10:02.227
This is our one chance
to find Hitler.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.897
Our one chance
to keep the promise

10:05.897 --> 10:10.485
we made to the memories
of the six million.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.655
Never again.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.203
Never again.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.794
Never again.

10:33.884 --> 10:34.843
All right, come on.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.979
Okay.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.397
Are you okay?

10:47.397 --> 10:50.359
Yeah.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.361
Ah. I just...

10:53.362 --> 10:57.657
Lonny, I just wanted to be able
to see him with my own two eyes.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.993
So one day I could tell Malika

10:59.993 --> 11:03.413
her mommy rid evil
from this world.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.376
You're not expendable.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.252
Not like me.

11:10.295 --> 11:12.547
You have to be here for her.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.320
- I was thinking...
- Why?

11:36.571 --> 11:41.326
Why ruin a glorious day?

11:41.868 --> 11:43.662
With your thinking.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.038
Don't start.

11:46.665 --> 11:49.501
That's what you do. You think...

11:49.835 --> 11:53.088
...and you scheme.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.592
Every scheme I've conjured

11:57.592 --> 12:01.221
has been to your
extreme benefit, Adolf.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.099
- Every?
- Yes.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.560
And a simple...

12:07.561 --> 12:09.020
...thank you.

12:09.020 --> 12:11.106
An acknowledgement.
Would it kill you?

12:12.149 --> 12:14.276
You would love that.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.821
If something kills me.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.659
Regime changes are necessary

12:22.659 --> 12:24.828
for the success
of a Fourth Reich.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.914
Our base is getting younger,

12:27.914 --> 12:29.082
more ignorant.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.835
My specialty.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.211
It was.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.505
Until you failed.

12:36.590 --> 12:40.385
You are a loser, Adolf.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.012
You lost.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.306
You cannot come back from that.

12:45.474 --> 12:47.851
But your name
still means something.

12:47.851 --> 12:51.313
And if you had
a son or a daughter,

12:51.313 --> 12:55.817
they could run on your name,
carry your mantle.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.111
Luckily for you...

12:59.196 --> 13:00.739
...you have a wife.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.283
Mrs. Hitler.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.244
Mrs. Hitler.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.957
We create a movement. We...

13:10.957 --> 13:13.376
we reach them with
a weapon more powerful

13:13.376 --> 13:15.670
than a nuclear bomb.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.130
With me...

13:18.131 --> 13:19.758
...as their new leader.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.637
A woman of tomorrow.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.265
A mother...

13:27.265 --> 13:30.644
for every lost child
of the world.

13:36.816 --> 13:42.030
Across the globe,
famed historians...

13:42.489 --> 13:48.662
...write of all I have created.

13:51.915 --> 13:56.044
With my hands, my heart,

13:56.044 --> 13:58.171
my mastermind

13:58.171 --> 14:01.341
I have constructed

14:01.341 --> 14:04.636
a new world,
and in all of these books

14:04.636 --> 14:07.931
is your undeserving name
next to mine.

14:08.974 --> 14:11.142
Next to mine.

14:12.185 --> 14:18.108
Marrying me was
your best accomplishment.

14:18.108 --> 14:23.238
And somehow you're convinced
that you deserve more.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.282
You are...

14:28.660 --> 14:34.749
...just a throw I lie next to.

14:36.084 --> 14:38.003
Why don't you listen...

14:39.004 --> 14:41.339
...to what always...

14:42.591 --> 14:44.301
...have saved you?

14:45.343 --> 14:46.428
My voice!

14:47.470 --> 14:49.639
My voice!

15:04.487 --> 15:08.617
W... Why are we going east?

15:11.786 --> 15:13.830
<i>[over radio] We
should be going west, no?</i>

15:15.915 --> 15:18.627
No. You're turned around.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.009
You said west.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.803
You misheard me.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.182
I know where he is.

15:40.065 --> 15:42.025
If Joe so much
as blinks suspiciously,

15:42.025 --> 15:43.360
we take him out.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.531
Feels familiar, no?

15:49.532 --> 15:51.576
Like the first time we met?

16:08.176 --> 16:10.512
So... these are all of them?

16:10.512 --> 16:12.097
Yes.

16:12.097 --> 16:15.850
So, the question is,
how does this assassin

16:15.850 --> 16:18.478
disappear from the crime scenes
so quickly?

16:18.478 --> 16:19.771
How does he do it?

16:20.980 --> 16:22.482
I believe
you're about to tell me.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.985
Of course I am. He hits his
targets at different locations.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.612
See? Different MOs,

16:27.612 --> 16:29.948
but they all have
one thing in common.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.659
Each of the kill sites
is bordering woodland.

16:32.659 --> 16:36.162
A dense forest made up
of a series of trails

16:36.162 --> 16:39.082
and centrally located here.

16:39.082 --> 16:43.712
Images show a structure here,
a home.

16:43.712 --> 16:47.382
This is where I believe
we will find our Nazi hunter.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.407
There it is.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.007
Meyer.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.384
Who are you,
and what do you want?

17:31.384 --> 17:32.385
No, lower the knife, please.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.928
Lower the knife.

17:33.928 --> 17:37.891
I may lower it into her aorta
if I don't like your answer.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.100
Meyer.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.310
Tell me why you're here
and what you want,

17:40.310 --> 17:42.771
or I will slit her throat.

17:42.771 --> 17:45.064
We're here for you,
for your help.

17:45.064 --> 17:49.235
We have a group of individuals
just like yourself.

17:49.235 --> 17:52.447
We capture and we deliver

17:52.447 --> 17:54.783
justice to fugitive Nazis.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.075
Look. Oh, look.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.161
Look, look.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.245
See?

18:00.246 --> 18:02.916
My name is Meyer Offerman.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.254
That's not possible.
I knew Meyer Offerman.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.007
How?

18:11.007 --> 18:14.302
Meyer Offerman loved my sister.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.348
Chava?

18:24.729 --> 18:26.064
All right.

18:38.493 --> 18:39.452
Hmm.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.331
Ah. I need that.

18:44.374 --> 18:45.291
Thank you.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.377
<i>Bitteschon.</i>

18:54.175 --> 18:56.594
You know,
she long thought that--

18:56.594 --> 18:59.556
well, we all have--
that you died.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.140
Hmm?

19:01.140 --> 19:04.227
Hmm. What if we have, Meyer?

19:05.728 --> 19:07.564
What if this is our heaven?

19:07.564 --> 19:09.023
Hunting them.

19:10.024 --> 19:12.151
What if this is our reward?

19:13.194 --> 19:15.488
There's still too much pain.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.535
Join us.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.287
We do what you do.

19:22.287 --> 19:25.790
Let us take you to America.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.375
- To see her.
- I can't.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.335
No. I can fund your efforts.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.045
- I don't need it.
- We have access

19:31.045 --> 19:32.672
to all sorts

19:32.672 --> 19:35.550
- of documentation...
- I said no.

19:42.181 --> 19:46.102
How long have you known
that Ruth was alive?

19:46.102 --> 19:47.478
Hmm?

19:49.647 --> 19:50.857
Twenty years.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.280
I know what her home
looks like in Brooklyn.

19:58.281 --> 19:59.949
It looked a bit like ours.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.620
I know what happened
to her daughter.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.787
Your daughter.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.584
I know she has a grandson...

20:10.627 --> 20:15.214
...Jonah, who is
her world entire.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.806
I know I miss her.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.768
Then why...

20:26.768 --> 20:29.354
why haven't you told her?

20:29.354 --> 20:32.941
If she knew what I'd become,

20:32.941 --> 20:35.360
she would stop me
from this work.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.362
She always wanted to protect me.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.864
That was her job.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.366
But this is mine.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.327
I like who I am now.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.704
I like what I've become.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.207
Chava?

20:49.207 --> 20:53.836
She died many, many years ago.

20:53.836 --> 20:56.255
The work is all...

20:56.255 --> 20:57.966
it's all I have now.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.596
You will not tell her
you saw me.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.431
Chava, it...

21:05.431 --> 21:09.686
It is not your truth
to tell, Meyer.

21:11.980 --> 21:14.399
I-I understand.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.154
I promise I... I won't.

21:20.154 --> 21:21.614
I won't tell her.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.617
I promise.

21:28.496 --> 21:29.747
<i>Don't you think</i>

21:29.747 --> 21:31.749
she deserves to know the truth?

21:33.126 --> 21:35.294
Ruth deserves a lot of things.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.172
But so, too, does Chava.

21:39.424 --> 21:43.052
You know, a person deserves
to tell their own story,

21:43.052 --> 21:45.847
however true, however not.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.018
But we shall pray for Chava.

21:50.018 --> 21:51.269
Why?

21:52.270 --> 21:54.856
She doesn't see clearly.

21:54.856 --> 21:57.108
It's the curse of the saint.

21:57.108 --> 22:00.069
All the light sees is darkness.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.655
And so, that's what
she thinks she is.

22:02.655 --> 22:06.534
When all we see of her is light.

22:07.535 --> 22:10.204
When you've been broken
too many times,

22:10.204 --> 22:12.415
when one goes too far to cope,

22:12.415 --> 22:14.500
to survive...

22:14.500 --> 22:17.170
one knows not
where the mind goes.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.568
We rest for a beat.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.906
Gather our strength.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.759
When I...

23:08.096 --> 23:10.556
When I first
escaped the camps...

23:13.643 --> 23:16.312
...I heard a story,

23:16.312 --> 23:19.023
a legend, a...

23:20.024 --> 23:22.985
...fairy tale about a man

23:22.985 --> 23:26.405
who... who lived in the woods,

23:26.405 --> 23:28.825
the Nazis called "The Plague."

23:30.118 --> 23:32.328
A Jewish superhero...

23:33.496 --> 23:37.333
...who vanished Nazis
from the face of this Earth.

23:39.585 --> 23:43.714
And years and years later,
I came across The Plague.

23:46.175 --> 23:48.636
And I fell in love with him.

23:50.096 --> 23:53.766
And we spent
the next two decades

23:53.766 --> 23:58.604
killing Nazis, me and Zev.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.951
<i>Until one day he...</i>

24:13.161 --> 24:16.080
...he put down the mask
and the cape.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.041
And I could not.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.425
He would have loved this.

24:29.677 --> 24:32.638
He always said,
if I ever found Hitler,

24:32.638 --> 24:36.726
he would don the mask and cape
once more and shuttle him out.

24:36.726 --> 24:39.145
Didn't Zev say that?

24:43.691 --> 24:44.984
Well.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.154
One day...

24:49.238 --> 24:51.282
...around a campfire,

24:51.282 --> 24:55.411
or at bedtime
or-or in the dark of the wood,

24:55.411 --> 24:57.955
the oppressed peoples
of the world

24:57.955 --> 25:01.375
will tell stories about you.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.421
A band of superheroes.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.675
And you, too, will become
the stuff of legend...

25:11.052 --> 25:13.304
...fairy tale,

25:13.304 --> 25:14.764
a myth.

25:16.933 --> 25:20.144
If only we succeed.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.673
I think this is it.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.216
What do you mean,
"this is it"?

25:50.216 --> 25:51.676
This is what?

25:51.676 --> 25:52.885
Give him a hand.

25:52.885 --> 25:56.430
Help him.
Let's-let's help him.

25:59.267 --> 26:01.185
What the hell?

26:01.185 --> 26:02.812
What is that thing?

26:02.812 --> 26:05.940
It's an escape hatch,
in case he has to flee again.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.775
It could lead us
into his compound.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.402
There's a system of tunnels.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.153
- Where does it empty out?
- I don't know.

26:11.153 --> 26:14.782
So, it could lead us out into
a bunch of guns in our faces.

26:14.782 --> 26:16.117
Are the tunnels guarded?

26:16.117 --> 26:17.952
- I don't know.
- How do you not

26:17.952 --> 26:21.122
- know these things?
- What's the Spanish
word for "this sucks"?

26:21.122 --> 26:23.833
Well, how far is
the front entrance?

26:23.833 --> 26:26.335
They'll see us coming
from miles away.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.545
This is the way.

26:27.545 --> 26:28.713
It's locked
from the inside.

26:28.713 --> 26:29.755
How the fuck are we
going to get in?

26:29.755 --> 26:31.215
I got this.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.969
A little bit of C-4
should do the trick.

26:43.728 --> 26:45.104
All right. Take cover.

26:57.825 --> 27:02.455
Cover your ears!
Better safe than sorry!

27:16.552 --> 27:18.804
Shall we?

27:23.392 --> 27:26.187
Travis and Joe
should be back soon.

27:26.187 --> 27:31.442
They better
have Jew scalps in hand.

27:31.442 --> 27:33.277
I'm bored.

27:34.904 --> 27:36.947
I'd like to play a game.

27:41.577 --> 27:42.703
What?

27:43.704 --> 27:45.373
You have other plans?

27:47.625 --> 27:49.085
I'll let you win.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.547
You will not let me win.

27:54.757 --> 27:56.717
I will win.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.228
"You will win."

28:09.980 --> 28:11.649
Do you remember
who told you that?

28:11.649 --> 28:12.650
In the bunker.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.276
No.

28:21.158 --> 28:23.244
"You will win."

28:40.469 --> 28:41.679
You.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.391
Will.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.520
Win.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.357
Goat.

28:53.357 --> 28:54.483
Pistol.

28:55.776 --> 28:57.027
Wolf.

28:57.027 --> 28:58.487
Schoolboy.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.239
Black sun.

29:00.239 --> 29:03.409
- And bunny rabbit.
- Who said that to you, Adolf?

29:05.286 --> 29:07.413
In the bunker, who was it, dear?

29:07.413 --> 29:08.664
Check it.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.085
<i>You wanted
the cyanide pill.</i>

29:13.085 --> 29:15.713
<i>You begged for it.</i>

29:15.713 --> 29:18.174
<i>On your knees.
And what did I say?</i>

29:20.134 --> 29:22.261
<i>"This isn't how
Adolf Hitler dies.</i>

29:22.261 --> 29:24.680
This isn't how the war ends."

29:25.681 --> 29:27.433
I said, "Don't do it.

29:28.434 --> 29:29.643
We'll get away.

29:29.643 --> 29:32.146
We'll make them think
we're dead,

29:32.146 --> 29:33.606
<i>then we'll escape.</i>

29:33.606 --> 29:36.859
<i>And we'll rebuild.
And one day, my dear...</i>

29:39.069 --> 29:41.530
<i>...you will win the war.</i>

29:41.530 --> 29:44.241
You will win."

29:44.241 --> 29:47.244
That's what I fucking said!

29:47.244 --> 29:48.913
Check them.

29:53.751 --> 29:55.711
You said "goat"?

30:01.050 --> 30:02.051
Gun?

30:03.844 --> 30:04.970
Wolf.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.600
Schoolboy.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.519
Black sun.

30:12.853 --> 30:14.647
And bunny rabbit.

30:15.773 --> 30:18.400
All wrong, Adolf.

30:18.400 --> 30:23.489
I have been playing
your game for 35 years.

30:25.074 --> 30:27.826
You finally want to win?

30:28.827 --> 30:30.538
It's time that you played mine.

30:30.538 --> 30:33.624
I know how Adolf Hitler wins.

30:35.626 --> 30:38.254
He instills the crown
on my head.

30:38.254 --> 30:39.797
And I communicate
through the youth,

30:39.797 --> 30:41.423
the ignorant, the people.

30:42.424 --> 30:43.842
The people!

30:45.427 --> 30:46.428
And you'll hear.

30:47.471 --> 30:50.391
On their TVs,
all across the world.

30:50.391 --> 30:57.147
Heil Hitler.

30:58.148 --> 31:00.901
Heil Hitler, forever.

31:02.903 --> 31:05.322
I will carry on your rule.

31:07.741 --> 31:11.453
Listen to me
now, like you did then.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.542
My voice saved you.

31:19.461 --> 31:22.965
My voice saves
the great white race.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.528
Hey. Slow down.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.113
Hey!

32:05.215 --> 32:06.592
I think we're here.

32:06.592 --> 32:09.553
- Where's here?
- I think a clearing

32:09.553 --> 32:11.805
just outside of
the compound's center.

32:11.805 --> 32:14.141
You think? Jesus Christ.

32:14.141 --> 32:15.559
I'll go in first.

32:15.559 --> 32:17.978
You follow.
The guards will see you.

32:17.978 --> 32:19.772
When they do,

32:19.772 --> 32:22.191
they'll rush him to the bunker,
beneath the big house.

32:23.192 --> 32:25.986
That'll give you the best chance
to get close enough to kill him.

32:26.987 --> 32:29.239
But if he gets to
the bunker before we do...

32:30.240 --> 32:32.785
...no amount of C-4 will get
through those walls.

32:32.785 --> 32:34.578
So we need to move quickly.

32:34.578 --> 32:36.246
You'll go in alone,

32:36.246 --> 32:39.708
draw their attention
and give us some time.

32:39.708 --> 32:43.087
And then take our stand and get
to the bunker before he does.

32:43.087 --> 32:45.047
You trust him to go alone?

32:45.047 --> 32:47.257
We made it this far. We're not
leaving here without Hitler.

32:47.257 --> 32:48.842
Not without
that monster's

32:48.842 --> 32:51.845
mustache on a fucking pike.

32:52.888 --> 32:53.889
Go.

33:02.189 --> 33:04.525
I hope you're right about him.

33:15.953 --> 33:17.204
Good morning,
Claudia!

33:17.204 --> 33:18.622
Good morning, Joe.

33:36.974 --> 33:38.058
Welcome back.

33:38.058 --> 33:39.435
You bring anything for us?

33:42.187 --> 33:43.272
Hans...

33:43.272 --> 33:47.526
...in a few seconds
armed enemies will enter...

33:48.110 --> 33:49.319
...right through here.

33:49.903 --> 33:52.114
...they're just behind me.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.742
They're coming for the FÃ¼hrer.

33:54.742 --> 33:55.659
Hurry!

33:55.659 --> 33:56.869
Sound the alarm!

34:05.836 --> 34:07.463
On my count...

34:12.342 --> 34:13.302
One...

34:17.055 --> 34:17.931
Two...

34:23.270 --> 34:24.104
Three!

34:30.194 --> 34:32.070
Mindy, get down.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.305
Let's go to
the mansion. It's up there.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.089
Intruders!

35:32.631 --> 35:33.674
Intruders!

35:34.049 --> 35:34.925
Intruders!

35:35.092 --> 35:35.968
Intruders!

35:36.426 --> 35:38.011
Coming now! Now!

35:39.471 --> 35:41.265
What's happening?

35:43.684 --> 35:44.726
Intruders!

35:45.143 --> 35:46.478
Intruders!

35:46.478 --> 35:47.354
Coming now! Now!

35:47.813 --> 35:49.815
Mein FÃ¼hrer, apologies,

35:49.815 --> 35:51.900
we have to get you
to the bunker immediately.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.027
Come.

35:55.863 --> 35:57.239
More are coming,
three o'clock.

35:57.239 --> 35:59.658
I can't do "o'clocks." Where?!

35:59.658 --> 36:02.244
To the right, schmuck!

36:05.163 --> 36:06.748
Fuck!

36:07.624 --> 36:09.001
Harriet, we got to go!

36:13.589 --> 36:15.173
Everybody back
to the tunnel, now!

36:15.173 --> 36:18.218
We don't know if
they got him yet.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.268
Joe!

37:20.989 --> 37:22.407
Joe!

37:35.420 --> 37:37.172
I couldn't
get the shot.

38:45.115 --> 38:47.367
- All right.
- All right.

38:50.537 --> 38:52.080
Get him
inside, now!

38:52.080 --> 38:53.915
You get
in that fucking door.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.084
You make him pay his debt,
you understand?

38:56.084 --> 38:57.252
Don't look back.

38:57.252 --> 38:58.962
- I'll cover you.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.797
We're taking him together.

39:07.637 --> 39:09.598
You were right, Jonah.

39:09.598 --> 39:11.975
Family is everything.

39:11.975 --> 39:14.061
I won't let anything
happen to you.

39:14.061 --> 39:15.812
I can't. Chava, I can't.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.397
Listen to me.

39:17.397 --> 39:20.942
In a few weeks,
we'll be at your wedding,

39:20.942 --> 39:23.195
drunk off our asses...

39:23.195 --> 39:25.489
No. No, don't. Don't...

39:25.489 --> 39:27.324
Hey, it's okay.

39:27.324 --> 39:29.743
It's okay.

39:29.743 --> 39:31.286
Next, <i>Mein Fuhrer.</i>

39:37.667 --> 39:39.503
Now go, you little twat.

39:39.503 --> 39:40.754
Fly!

39:41.755 --> 39:42.672
Ah!

39:46.551 --> 39:48.428
No! No!

41:03.003 --> 41:03.879
No, no!

41:16.725 --> 41:20.228
You...

41:28.320 --> 41:32.240
You don't deserve
to choose how this ends.

41:39.039 --> 41:41.166
You need to be held accountable

41:41.166 --> 41:43.710
for the crimes
that you've committed.
