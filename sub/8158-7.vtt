Oh, yeah!

00:55.480 --> 00:59.040
Oi, Grandad, you wanna see this
book Mickey Pierce lent me.

00:59.120 --> 01:04.200
It shows how to say filthy things
to women without speaking.

01:04.320 --> 01:06.280
They can't set their brothers on you!

01:07.520 --> 01:11.440
Do you like your baked potatoes
really well done, Rodney?

01:12.080 --> 01:15.360
-Have I got a choice?
-Well, not really.

01:16.200 --> 01:21.840
Yeah, Grandad, I like 'em all burnt up
so they look like rock-hard prunes!

01:21.960 --> 01:24.800
Oh, good.
Well, dinner won't be long.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.520
<i>Body Language?</i>

01:30.800 --> 01:33.440
It's no good for you.
You'd need an interpreter.

01:34.960 --> 01:38.160
Hiya! All right, Grandad?
Dinner ruined yet?

01:38.920 --> 01:43.280
-Coming along nicely, Del Boy.
-Good. Here y'are. Hang on.

01:43.360 --> 01:47.240
There's a score for you.
Little Christmas pressie.

01:47.320 --> 01:50.240
Oh, cheers, Del,
that's very nice of yer.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.040
I didn't get you nothing.

01:53.120 --> 01:57.040
I don't agree with the commercialisation
of a Christian festival.

01:59.040 --> 02:03.840
I don't believe that!
He took my money and gave me a rollicking!

02:03.920 --> 02:05.800
It's like being mugged
by a magistrate!

02:06.960 --> 02:10.040
Oh, and...er...merry Christmas!

02:10.120 --> 02:13.520
And a partridge up your pear tree!

02:13.600 --> 02:18.320
What happened to you? I thought
I'd see you down the Nag's Head

02:18.400 --> 02:23.240
for a pre-luncheon aperitif
and some light conversation.

02:23.320 --> 02:26.200
You know, with them little
head-bangers of yours.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.280
RODNEY: No.

02:27.400 --> 02:31.480
My stomach's a bit dicey.
You know, burning pains.

02:31.560 --> 02:34.200
That'll teach you to play Russian
roulette with a mutton vindaloo!

02:35.200 --> 02:38.320
No, this is psychosomatic.

02:38.400 --> 02:44.120
Me brain is sending messages that
Grandad's Christmas dinner is on its way!

02:45.840 --> 02:50.120
Have a butcher's in there.
It's all smoke and smells!
It's horrible.

02:50.200 --> 02:54.240
The potatoes
look like lumps of anthracite.

02:54.520 --> 03:00.440
There's green stuff. I don't
know what it is! I was gonna ask,
then thought I'd wait for you.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.800
Why do you let him do it?

03:02.880 --> 03:04.360
Well, it's tradition.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.880
He's done it ever since Mum went.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.600
And cocked it up!

03:09.840 --> 03:13.240
What do you want?
A <i>sacre bleu</i> chef or something?

03:14.160 --> 03:18.720
I don't fancy it any more than you,
but what can we do about it, eh?

03:19.160 --> 03:23.040
Let's pretend we've both become
vegetarians so that we don't have to
eat the turkey.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.240
Don't be a dipstick all your life, Rodney.

03:26.320 --> 03:30.760
Then we'll end up with a plate
full of anthracite and green stuff!

03:31.520 --> 03:35.200
Well, I'll say I'm on hunger strike.
Some kind of humanitarian grounds.

03:35.320 --> 03:40.840
Leave it out! I remember the last
time you went on hunger strike

03:40.920 --> 03:45.320
over American Cruise missiles
being based in Britain.

03:45.560 --> 03:48.840
You'd starve yourself till
all the missiles were removed!

03:48.960 --> 03:49.840
-So?
-So.

03:50.280 --> 03:53.600
That was eight months ago.
The missiles are still here.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.160
More to the point, so are you!

03:56.840 --> 03:59.560
You went one and half days
then got a curry!

03:59.640 --> 04:00.840
I was starving!

04:00.920 --> 04:03.480
That's the idea of it, you plonker!

04:04.480 --> 04:05.840
Come out of it!

04:05.920 --> 04:08.480
No, Grandad will never wear that.

04:09.640 --> 04:15.600
Anyway, cooking the Christmas dinner
has become Grandad's purpose in life.

04:16.880 --> 04:20.400
All year, he sits watching them tellies

04:20.480 --> 04:23.560
like a unoiled redundant cog,

04:23.640 --> 04:26.920
but come Christmas,
he knows he can whirr into action.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.680
It's his role in the family circle,

04:29.760 --> 04:33.040
makes him feel he has a part to play.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.120
That he's still needed.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.440
You wouldn't want to take that away
from him for the sake of a little...

04:39.520 --> 04:41.280
-Botulism!
-Well...

04:41.360 --> 04:43.520
No, no, all right, Del.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.800
Why don't you do what I do?

04:45.880 --> 04:49.480
Put it in your mouth
and think of England.

04:50.240 --> 04:55.080
For all we know, this year it may
turn out to be a gourmet's dream.

04:55.680 --> 04:59.120
I'll just strain the gravy,
then I'll get it up.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.480
We must get a plug put on this!

05:25.680 --> 05:28.080
I'll have some wine, please, Rodney.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.600
Do you want gravy, Del?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.040
No, thanks, Grandad,
I'll have a drop of wine.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.640
Thank you. <i>Merci, merci.</i>

05:48.520 --> 05:51.440
Oh, <i>bain marie!</i>

05:52.000 --> 05:55.640
I will say this for those frogs,
they make a blinding drop of wine.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.600
Here, you know that shyster
at the off-licence?

05:59.680 --> 06:02.760
He tried to palm me off with table wine!

06:03.080 --> 06:05.360
Must've thought I was a Philistine.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.400
I pulled him up a bit sharpish, though.

06:09.480 --> 06:13.720
"I don't want none of yer table wine,"
I said.

06:14.040 --> 06:18.520
"You get down in that cellar and
get me a bottle of vin ordinaire!"

06:21.400 --> 06:23.760
Right...here we go.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.000
Not bad, Grandad.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.560
Slightly underdone, maybe.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.520
Slightly? I reckon
the kiss of life would revive it!

06:42.080 --> 06:44.200
That's enough, Rodney.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.880
How's your guts now, Rodney?

06:47.960 --> 06:50.360
Not too bad now, Grandad,
thank you very much.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.800
Hope you ain't got worms.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.000
He's doing it on purpose!

06:55.080 --> 06:58.160
That's enough you two.
It's a dinner table.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.520
I mean, worms and all that.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.400
He's just got a burning sensation,
haven't you?

07:04.480 --> 07:05.640
Yeah.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.440
Maybe they're glow worms!

07:10.600 --> 07:13.600
Oi, oi, what's your game?

07:13.760 --> 07:15.160
Can we change the subject?

07:15.240 --> 07:19.720
All right. There's no need to get
overwrought. There you go.

07:24.080 --> 07:27.160
This turkey's lovely, Grandad.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.480
-Isn't it, Rodney?
-Teriffic.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.400
Who's Brenda and Terry?

07:34.560 --> 07:37.280
-Eh?
-Who's Brenda and Terry?

07:37.360 --> 07:39.080
-Who's Brenda and Terry?
-Yeah.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.560
Who's Brenda and Terry?

07:40.640 --> 07:41.720
I dunno.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.600
What are you on about?

07:44.440 --> 07:46.480
We got a Christmas card from 'em.

07:46.560 --> 07:51.480
It said, "Love Brenda and Terry and
the kids, Shirley, Shane and Shaun".

07:51.720 --> 07:56.200
-That's Brenda and Terry.
-I know! But who is Brenda and Terry?

07:56.600 --> 08:00.280
-Shirley, Shane and Shaun's mum and dad.
-Oh.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.120
Did we send them one back?

08:03.200 --> 08:06.200
How could we?
We don't know who they are
or where they live.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.840
Just as well with them rotten cards
you bought!

08:10.920 --> 08:15.120
You didn't like them cause they came
from a charity organisation!

08:15.200 --> 08:17.560
That's not fair.

08:17.640 --> 08:20.160
-Nobody likes a good cause
better than me.
-No.

08:20.240 --> 08:25.240
But with Christmas cards, you gotta
be careful which charity you choose.

08:25.840 --> 08:29.000
What do you mean, careful?

08:29.080 --> 08:33.120
Well, some of those cards might offend
some of our neighbours and friends.

08:33.200 --> 08:39.280
It says, "Merry Christmas from Del
Boy, Rodney and Grandad, and the
Deptford Drug Addiction Centre"!

08:40.480 --> 08:43.760
You don't think that's a good cause?

08:44.240 --> 08:49.880
All I'm saying is that people
prefer a traditional Christmas card,

08:50.160 --> 08:53.720
a wintry scene with snowmen,
little robin redbreasts,

08:54.280 --> 08:57.680
not holly and mistletoe
wrapped round a rusty syringe!

08:59.000 --> 09:01.320
You do me right up sometimes, Del!

09:01.400 --> 09:04.800
I don't know why they want
drug addiction centres.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.200
Haven't we got enough drug addicts
without them recruiting?

09:12.120 --> 09:15.800
No, Grandad,
they're not training centres.

09:16.160 --> 09:20.160
They... I give up!
Can we change the subject again?

09:20.240 --> 09:24.360
We're going through subjects
quicker than <i>Mastermind!</i>

09:27.520 --> 09:29.680
You didn't throw the giblets away, did ya?

09:31.800 --> 09:36.120
I only asked 'cause I promised 'em to
the old girl downstairs for her cat!

09:36.400 --> 09:41.720
There weren't none. It was ready
cleaned, said so on the box.

09:41.800 --> 09:46.560
Yeah, they put the giblets
in a plastic bag in the turkey.

09:48.360 --> 09:49.440
Do they?

09:49.520 --> 09:50.520
Yeah.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.240
You took the bag out, didn't ya?

09:57.200 --> 09:58.640
I didn't know it was in there, Del.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.280
RODNEY: Oh, my god.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.800
You cooked it with everything still in it?

10:03.880 --> 10:06.120
Oh, my good God!

10:06.800 --> 10:09.440
It's like peering
into the jaws of hell!

10:10.240 --> 10:14.280
Didn't you notice when you put the
stuffing in?

10:14.360 --> 10:16.000
There's stuffing, too?

10:16.080 --> 10:17.600
There's everything in 'ere, Rodney!

10:18.400 --> 10:23.720
There's sage and onion,
molten plastic and things!

10:23.800 --> 10:26.240
It's like Irish night at a delicatessen!

10:26.760 --> 10:29.840
I didn't know it was in there, Del Boy.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.400
Here, all right, all right.
All right, Grandad.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.440
Don't get overwrought.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.520
It's over and done with.

10:39.600 --> 10:44.480
Don't upset yourself. It's like the
French say, it's a fait a-complain.

10:55.120 --> 10:58.280
-What about the old afters then?
-I'll go and get it.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.200
-Two to one...
-All right, all right!

11:12.880 --> 11:16.120
Don't worry, 'cause custard is his forte.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.720
Ooh, my God!

11:22.400 --> 11:26.360
Do you like your Christmas pudding
really well done?

I don't like circuses.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.560
-What?
-I don't like circuses.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.960
-I never have liked 'em.
-Teriffic.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.600
I never will like 'em.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.920
You made your point. Why not switch over?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.760
There's one on the other side!

13:00.840 --> 13:06.320
Is there? Pity you don't like 'em,
cos you could be having
a whale of a time!

13:07.080 --> 13:09.560
Put a sock in it for half an hour.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.080
Good living in a tower block, innit?

13:21.160 --> 13:23.680
Mustard, the Queen dunno
what she's missing.

13:24.600 --> 13:28.360
Look at that view, eh?
On a clear day you can see...

13:28.440 --> 13:29.600
the ground!

13:32.480 --> 13:33.440
Boring!

HIGH-PITCHED
♪ Boring! ♪

13:46.240 --> 13:47.520
Boring!

13:47.600 --> 13:50.440
I'll whack you one in a minute!

13:53.200 --> 13:54.840
Nothing's open and I'm bored!

13:55.760 --> 13:59.360
Hang about, I'll get on the phone
and knock you up a mardi gras!

14:01.120 --> 14:03.760
Everyone's bored.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.120
Christmas is a religious festival.
It's meant to be boring.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.080
We're celebrating the birth
of our Lord, a time of great joy!

14:12.600 --> 14:15.240
That's why everything's closed.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.560
Everyone's enjoying themselves
like us.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.920
-Enjoying themselves?
-Yeah, where's me nuts?

14:26.560 --> 14:30.040
Take a look out there, Del!
It's like a neutron bomb's hit it.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.600
The buildings are standing,
but there's no sign of life.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.280
The British nation has forgotten
how to enjoy itself.

14:39.840 --> 14:45.120
We're charging towards a cliff edge
of terminal boredom like a herd of them...

14:46.200 --> 14:48.600
What's them things
what commit suicide?

14:48.680 --> 14:49.880
Japanese.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.120
No...lemmings!
Like a herd of lemmings.

14:56.280 --> 14:59.800
Let's go out somewhere. There's
bound to be a pub or club open.

15:00.120 --> 15:01.560
It's Christmas night, Rodney.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.360
The Monte Carlo Club is open.
Then again, it's a bit rough.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.400
Ooh, rough? It's all those big men,
drinking beer and burping!

15:11.600 --> 15:12.440
You big tart!

15:13.080 --> 15:18.440
Let's go then.
We might pull a couple of birds.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.240
I don't wanna go out.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.680
You're boring, too!

15:21.760 --> 15:24.000
You're hardly a go on the big dipper!

15:24.080 --> 15:26.040
Why stay in?

15:26.280 --> 15:30.480
It may have slipped your notice,
but three people live here.

15:30.560 --> 15:36.000
You, me and a scruffy little man
who does funny things to turkeys,
our grandfather!

15:37.000 --> 15:41.120
You're not suggesting
we leave him on his own?

15:41.360 --> 15:43.120
We often leave him alone.

15:43.200 --> 15:46.080
But not on Christmas night.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.960
He wouldn't mind just this once.

15:50.040 --> 15:56.600
He'd pretend he wouldn't mind,
but you don't know what he'd think
sat in this flat all on his own.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.600
Thinking about the good old days

15:59.680 --> 16:01.640
when Mum and Dad were here

16:01.720 --> 16:04.360
and Christmas was a big family affair.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.400
And we're still family.

16:07.480 --> 16:10.920
We'll sit with Grandad
and watch <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

16:11.000 --> 16:13.080
I hate that.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.200
-Switch over.
-What's on?

16:15.280 --> 16:16.280
Circus!

16:16.920 --> 16:18.800
I want to go out, Del!

16:18.880 --> 16:24.120
Listen, there are a lot of old people
tonight sitting on their own!

16:24.520 --> 16:27.960
Half of them don't get a Christmas card,
let alone company.

16:28.560 --> 16:33.560
You'll stay in with me and Grandad.
If I wanna go out, I'll go out!

16:34.200 --> 16:35.760
-You won't!
-I will!

16:35.840 --> 16:37.520
-You won't, Rodney!
-I will, Del!

16:37.760 --> 16:39.480
-You won't!
-I will!

16:39.560 --> 16:41.160
-You won't!
-I will!

16:41.240 --> 16:43.720
I'm off out now. See you later.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.600
Yeah, see you later.
You won't!

16:46.680 --> 16:48.280
-I will!
-Listen...

16:49.400 --> 16:50.880
Oi!

16:51.120 --> 16:53.160
Where do you think you're going?

16:53.240 --> 16:57.000
To the old folks Christmas do
at the community centre.

16:57.080 --> 17:02.080
Anything's better than sitting here
listening to you two arguing!

17:02.640 --> 17:06.400
Tell us what happens
in <i>The Sound of Music.</i> See ya.

17:07.240 --> 17:10.400
Yes...see yer, Grandad.

17:10.840 --> 17:13.920
Well, that's terrific, that is?

17:14.000 --> 17:18.200
He goes out gallivanting
and we have to watch Julie Andrews!

17:18.880 --> 17:21.960
No, brother, definitely not.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.880
Let's put our glad rags on
and hit the Monte Carlo Club, eh?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.120
Yeah.

17:26.680 --> 17:30.320
I'll have a bath first
cos there's hardly any hot water.

17:31.040 --> 17:35.360
You fix yourself a drink, make
yourself comfy and watch the circus.

18:07.960 --> 18:12.840
Oi, John? Give us a Remy Martin
with cream soda and lots of ice

18:12.920 --> 18:14.720
and...half a lager.

18:15.760 --> 18:19.360
-Hello, you all right, Earl?
-Hello, Del, nice Christmas?

18:19.440 --> 18:22.320
Yeah, blinder. Where's the enemy?

18:22.400 --> 18:24.920
She took the kids over her mum's.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.080
How's the old man?

18:26.880 --> 18:29.240
Up and down like Tower Bridge.

18:29.480 --> 18:34.920
Still in hospital.
Unconscious mostly. When he wakes
up, he dunno where he is.

18:36.800 --> 18:42.640
Next time, when he comes round,
you wish him a merry Christmas
from me and Rodney.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.840
I will, Del.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.520
What's...what's wrong with him?

18:48.120 --> 18:49.240
Can't pronounce it.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.040
-How much is that?
-98p.

18:55.120 --> 18:56.680
Here, keep the change.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.560
Listen, my son.
This is what you wanna do.

19:00.960 --> 19:05.640
Get hold of one of them surgeons,
the guys in the white jackets,

19:05.720 --> 19:08.960
and say you want some antibiotics.

19:09.160 --> 19:14.560
Anti-bio-tics.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.280
Hang on, I'll write it down for you.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.920
Rodney, gimme that Replay
I gave you for Christmas.

19:23.360 --> 19:27.560
Don't you think the hospital's
already thought of that?

19:27.640 --> 19:29.000
That bunch of wallies?

19:29.840 --> 19:32.680
No, these are magic things, Earl.

19:32.760 --> 19:38.400
God knows where they get 'em.
Remember when Grandad
was in hospital?

19:38.640 --> 19:43.440
They gave him so many,
one day he sneezed and two other
blokes got better!

19:46.160 --> 19:50.520
There. Don't take it to a chemist,
cos it ain't a prescription.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.720
No, I won't, Del Boy. Thanks a lot.
That's really nice.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.320
Now, you have
a good Christmas, you hear.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.480
Come on, Rodney.

20:01.240 --> 20:03.280
You are something else, you are!

20:03.360 --> 20:08.000
You've stuck your nose in before,
but this takes the biscuit!

20:08.080 --> 20:09.920
Suddenly, you work miracles!

20:10.360 --> 20:15.280
Listen, Rodney, life has been
gutting for Earl quite recently.

20:15.800 --> 20:20.320
He got made redundant. It's like
that between him and his missus,

20:20.400 --> 20:25.280
then his old man collapses in the
Nag's Head across from me and Trig.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.880
It was terrible!
The glasses went flying.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.960
Was it serious?

20:31.040 --> 20:32.840
No, I only had that much left.

20:33.920 --> 20:37.120
I mean, he can't afford
a private hospital.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.440
He wanted to take his old man to Lourdes,

20:39.520 --> 20:44.480
but he couldn't afford the fare to Leeds,
let alone Lourdes!

20:45.840 --> 20:48.920
I've just given him
a bit of false hope.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.080
A light at the end of the tunnel,
straw to grab at,

20:52.800 --> 20:55.240
bit of promise for the new year.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.880
MOUTHS

20:59.360 --> 21:04.440
What if he tells the hospital
to give the drugs and it finishes
the old man off?

21:05.440 --> 21:09.600
Leave it out! What do you
think they are? Wallies?

21:10.200 --> 21:12.080
-You said...
-Come on, you idiot!

21:13.480 --> 21:17.840
You're flash, ain't ya?
You think you know the lot.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.880
Everything about you is...lairy!

21:22.800 --> 21:24.440
What do you mean, lairy?

21:24.520 --> 21:29.520
Look at the way you're dressed. You
make a Christmas tree look sombre!

21:29.840 --> 21:34.400
And God knows how you've got
the courage to wear all that gold!

21:34.480 --> 21:37.480
You must look like
a mugger's pension scheme!

21:38.600 --> 21:45.080
How do you think a peacock
attracts a lady peacock, eh?
With his plumage!

21:45.160 --> 21:47.600
This is my plumage!

21:47.680 --> 21:54.600
When I approach a bird, she doesn't
see the real me, young, good
looking man about town, own teeth.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.760
She sees, in her subconscious,

21:57.840 --> 22:02.160
a white yacht floating on the blue
waters of a Caribbean bay.

22:02.360 --> 22:06.920
-Is that right?
-With you, it's a winkle barge
at Southend!

22:07.960 --> 22:11.960
No, 'cause I don't need the bullion
and the perfume and the white shoes,

22:12.040 --> 22:14.440
'cause I'm natural. I'm me, Del!

22:14.520 --> 22:17.600
I know you're you.
That's why you end up with dogs!

22:17.760 --> 22:19.160
I do not!

22:19.240 --> 22:22.160
Leave it out, you've had more dogs
than Crufts!

22:23.000 --> 22:27.280
-The cleaners found a muzzle
in the pocket of your suit!
-Shh!

22:28.520 --> 22:32.000
No, Rodney, I know the secret,
so I blag the good 'uns,

22:32.080 --> 22:35.160
the air hostesses,
the part-time models.

22:35.240 --> 22:39.560
Yes, bruv, I got the secret.
Never fails me.

22:44.320 --> 22:47.640
Got a bone handy, Rodders?
I think you've just cracked it again!

23:11.800 --> 23:14.200
Couldn't half do with a sit down,
my pins ache!

23:14.280 --> 23:18.320
Look at us! The Peckham Playboys.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.800
Bet the only one who's pulled is Grandad!

23:20.880 --> 23:24.520
Only thing you pull at Christmas
is your cracker!

23:25.400 --> 23:28.720
Look, there's a table free,
Rodders. Look lively!

23:34.240 --> 23:37.280
-Hey, Del, look!
-Oh, what?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.960
They pinched our table.

23:40.040 --> 23:42.160
Never mind, look at them two!

23:42.240 --> 23:43.720
I wanted to sit down.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.280
Well, sit at their table, come on!

23:52.840 --> 23:55.240
-Go on, then, Del.
-Go on, what?

23:55.320 --> 23:56.840
Chat 'em up!

23:57.080 --> 23:59.880
How come
I always do the donkey work?

23:59.960 --> 24:06.840
You're like a spy. You find out
where the enemy is hiding,
but I have to go do the capturing!

24:07.240 --> 24:13.000
-It's about time you took some shot
and shell. Go on.
-Me, chat 'em up?

24:13.480 --> 24:17.400
-Yeah, go on.
-All right, I'll do it.

24:18.600 --> 24:21.640
-Well, go on, then.
-I will.

24:28.280 --> 24:29.840
RODNEY PANTS

24:29.920 --> 24:30.720
-What are you doing?
-Eh?

24:30.800 --> 24:33.440
-What are you doing?
-Psyching myself up.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.080
It's OK, girls,
he's just psyching himself up!

24:38.160 --> 24:39.760
Shut up, will you?

24:39.840 --> 24:42.120
Come on, behave yourself.

24:42.200 --> 24:48.040
-This is kamikaze time. Get over there.
-I will in my own time, Del!

24:58.760 --> 25:00.440
Well, go on then!

25:00.520 --> 25:01.760
Just shut up, will ya?

25:13.600 --> 25:16.760
DEL: Oi! Soppy! Come here.

25:22.480 --> 25:26.480
I'd like to kill you sometimes.
I'd really like to hurt you bad!

25:26.560 --> 25:29.360
What was that silly walk for?

25:29.440 --> 25:32.880
It wasn't a silly walk!
It was body language!

25:32.960 --> 25:35.040
I thought you were limping.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.880
I was talking to 'em!

25:36.960 --> 25:40.000
What were you
supposed to be saying?

25:40.080 --> 25:42.440
The walk was saying...

25:42.520 --> 25:44.520
pelvis, virility.

25:44.600 --> 25:50.960
It was saying,
"Here comes a man who's got natural
masculinity and maturity."

25:51.040 --> 25:55.240
Looked more like, "Here comes a man
with his truss on backwards!"

25:55.680 --> 25:59.200
Just don't do it. Don't do it.

25:59.280 --> 26:03.120
Go over again
and, this time, walk normal.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.320
I won't go now. I looked a right lemon.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.760
You didn't. Go on.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.640
After aborting my attempt? You go.

26:10.720 --> 26:13.840
After you made a lemon of yourself?
No way, bruv!

26:13.920 --> 26:17.800
Tell you what we'll do.
We'll act cool.

26:18.560 --> 26:24.200
We'll stroll casually to the bar,
then, when they're not looking...

26:24.480 --> 26:27.080
-Sneak out?
-We'll sneak... No!

26:27.160 --> 26:33.960
When they're not looking,
we'll ambush 'em!
You wally. Come on.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.920
-Del...
-I've got it!

26:54.000 --> 26:55.480
-No, but...
-Shut up, shut UP!

26:56.600 --> 27:00.720
This is what we'll do.
You're gonna leave the club.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.000
-Leave?
-Yeah.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.400
Then, when you get outside,
leave it a few minutes,

27:05.480 --> 27:11.280
then tell the doorman
there's a new Rolls-Royce Corniche
obstructing your three-wheel van.

27:12.840 --> 27:18.400
Why? 'Cause then he'll get on the mike
and say, "Will the owner
of the new Rolls-Royce Corniche

27:18.480 --> 27:22.080
"kindly move it, as it is
obstructing a three-wheeled van."

27:22.160 --> 27:29.120
Then I will casually get up,
jangling my keys,
and join you outside.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.960
Why?

27:33.120 --> 27:37.920
'Cause them birds will think I drive
a brand-new Rolls-Royce Corniche!

27:38.000 --> 27:39.280
Oh, yeah!

27:41.440 --> 27:44.400
Yeah, but they'll also think
I drive a three-wheeled van!

27:45.200 --> 27:49.000
-You do!
-I don't want them knowing that!

27:49.080 --> 27:51.720
They won't, cos you'll be outside.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.200
-With you.
-Right!

27:55.760 --> 27:59.280
So, the girls will be in here
in the warm,

27:59.360 --> 28:03.720
and we'll be outside
congratulating each other,

28:03.800 --> 28:07.320
then we'll have to pay
to get back in again.

28:12.280 --> 28:15.120
Yeah, all right, clever dick!

28:15.760 --> 28:19.840
We'll play it by ear. We'll just go
and engage them in conversation.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.040
Right.

28:25.240 --> 28:27.200
-No, hold it, Del.
-What?

28:27.280 --> 28:29.960
What sort of conversation will it be?

28:30.040 --> 28:36.960
You always say we've got flash cars and
we're film producers with private jets!

28:37.160 --> 28:39.160
Everyone exaggerates, Rodney.

28:39.240 --> 28:43.800
Yeah, but I get embarrassed.
Look, just tell 'em the truth, right?

28:43.880 --> 28:46.640
Just tell 'em what we do.

28:46.720 --> 28:49.880
All right. I just wanna sit down,
you do the talking.

28:49.960 --> 28:50.800
Right.

28:52.160 --> 28:55.320
-No, hold it, Del.
-Oh, God almighty!

28:55.400 --> 28:59.440
-What shall I say to them?
-Well, I dunno.

28:59.520 --> 29:03.920
Tell them you went to an auction
and bought a 1962 A40,

29:04.000 --> 29:10.480
that you sold 30 Christmas trees
in the market and two gross
of fire-salvage Rubix cubes!

29:10.720 --> 29:12.720
Tantalise them.

29:13.720 --> 29:16.640
-It won't bore them?
-No.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.240
They won't have had such fun
since their last exorcism!

29:19.320 --> 29:20.960
I can talk about Christmas!

29:21.040 --> 29:23.640
Tell them about the giblets.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.480
Come on.

29:26.520 --> 29:32.080
-No, Del, hold it.
-Look, I shall kick you in the...shins!
Now what?

29:32.600 --> 29:35.560
-Which one do you fancy?
-Not yours!

29:35.640 --> 29:41.520
-They're both very nice.
I ain't particular.
-I ain't, neither.

29:41.800 --> 29:44.880
-Good. I'll have the blonde.
-I fancy her!

29:44.960 --> 29:50.120
Gordon Bennett! Now listen,
the dark-haired one is very nice.

29:50.680 --> 29:54.800
I reckon I've seen her coming out
of Guy's Hospital.

29:54.880 --> 30:01.840
Either she's sick, or she's a nurse.
You like nurses, eh?
Particularly if they're in uniform.

30:02.880 --> 30:07.280
Take it or leave it. Anyway, she's
not wearing a uniform, is she?

30:08.440 --> 30:13.200
Of course not!
You don't come to the Monte Carlo
Club dressed like Sister George.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.680
But she might have it with her!

30:16.760 --> 30:20.880
Oh, yeah, in case she sees
an accident on her way home.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.520
OK, so she hasn't got her uniform!

30:24.600 --> 30:27.720
On the other hand, she might have
something for your stomach!

30:28.080 --> 30:32.080
We're going to make our move
and I'll do the talking!

30:32.680 --> 30:38.720
So, if you should hear things
like Malibu Beach or Lady Diana,
don't get nervous!

30:39.080 --> 30:41.080
All right.

30:49.880 --> 30:53.360
You dozy little twonk, Rodney!

30:53.440 --> 30:56.000
Don't blame me, it's your fault!

30:56.080 --> 30:59.320
Five minutes ago, I was going
and you kept calling me back!

30:59.400 --> 31:02.440
An hour ago, you called me back!

31:02.520 --> 31:04.640
'Cause you was doing the silly walk!

31:05.280 --> 31:11.080
Your timing was wrong.
They'd hardly sat down and you were
steaming over like Ivor the Engine!

31:12.280 --> 31:15.120
It's no good crashing in
with a smile and a prayer.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.360
Women need time.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.440
My tactics never fail.

31:20.520 --> 31:26.000
Wouldn't do with the ones you chat up!
I've heard your patter, my son.

31:26.080 --> 31:30.480
If they don't know Adam Ant's birthday
or the Chelsea result,
it's <i>Goodnight Vienna!</i>

31:30.960 --> 31:34.800
With me, it's different.
I consider a woman's feelings!

31:34.880 --> 31:36.040
SCOFFS

31:36.120 --> 31:42.080
I do! When a woman goes out with me,
she is guaranteed three things.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.960
Well, four, actually, but
the fourth is an optional extra!

31:46.040 --> 31:48.360
She's guaranteed a well-dressed man.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.560
GUFFAWS

31:49.640 --> 31:51.240
She is!

31:51.320 --> 31:55.800
She's guaranteed a steak meal
and care and consideration.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.240
-Oh, now...
-Oh, yes, she is!

31:58.840 --> 32:01.320
I consider a woman's feelings.

32:01.400 --> 32:05.680
It's so easy to hurt her deeply
with a thoughtless word,

32:06.480 --> 32:08.920
a badly timed gesture.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.160
No, I care about women's feelings.

32:12.240 --> 32:15.440
There's too much pain in this world
without me causing more.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.680
Oh, no, Del...

32:26.760 --> 32:32.920
Excuse me, ladies, it's getting late
and we were wondering if you
were going home soon?

32:33.160 --> 32:35.840
Yes, we were just going
to get our coats.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.280
Oh, good. We can have your chairs!

32:41.120 --> 32:44.120
Come on, Rodney!
Excuse me. Come on.
