WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:05.000
and it's topped off with a gentle dusting of powdere

00:05.000 --> 00:07.730
it's the best french toast in town.

00:09.700 --> 00:12.160
I'll have the egg whites,please.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.440
<font color=#38B0DE>The Closer
Season2 Episode07</font>

00:15.050 --> 00:18.600
The best french toast in town?
Your favorite diner?

00:18.600 --> 00:21.300
What did you do,sergeant?

00:22.380 --> 00:24.830
Well,daniels and I are--

00:24.830 --> 00:28.080
well,we were just having dinners and seeing movies

00:28.080 --> 00:31.540
but it's my--ahem-- duty to inform you,

00:31.540 --> 00:37.210
per department policy,that within the last
48 hours it became something more like,um...

00:38.170 --> 00:39.500
dating.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.920
Oh,no.
Really?

00:41.920 --> 00:43.220
Hey!

00:43.220 --> 00:44.910
You guys cops?

00:44.910 --> 00:46.570
Yeah,why?

00:46.570 --> 00:49.420
Somebody's head is in my dumpster.

01:36.790 --> 01:38.560
It's a head.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.740
Just a head.

01:40.740 --> 01:41.820
A human head?

01:41.820 --> 01:44.830
Staring right at me,not that I got too close.
But,yes,a head.

01:44.830 --> 01:46.760
Ohh!

01:51.990 --> 01:55.580
Uh,please don't clear our table.
Thank you.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.360
Ugh. Thank you.

02:07.390 --> 02:08.470
Chief!

02:08.470 --> 02:10.800
I'm fine.

02:12.130 --> 02:14.570
Here you go.

02:23.290 --> 02:25.210
You might wanna...

02:25.210 --> 02:28.280
oh,for heaven's sakes.
It is a head.

02:31.510 --> 02:33.000
Oh,my lord.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.100
Chief?

02:34.100 --> 02:36.960
I found some feet.

02:45.590 --> 02:47.710
You think these feet go with this head?

02:48.260 --> 02:50.420
I sure hope so.

03:03.190 --> 03:05.500
Dirty diapers in that trash over there.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.040
Yeah,'cause there's nothing else
around here to make a person sick.

03:08.040 --> 03:11.720
I don't want to hear another word
about you and daniels,ok?

03:11.720 --> 03:14.450
You just keep it to yourself.

03:22.730 --> 03:25.120
Is this diner on your regular route?

03:25.120 --> 03:26.670
I eat there twice a day.

03:26.670 --> 03:29.740
Right now is good 'cause it's right
before the garbage truck comes.

03:29.740 --> 03:32.700
I usually have my best luck for
dinner after 10:00.

03:32.930 --> 03:37.120
But I'm going to tell you,
last night they weren't serving no head.

03:37.940 --> 03:41.940
So the head landed in the dumpster
between 10:00 P.M.,8:00 A.M.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.920
Thank you so much for your time.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.900
And feel free to order whatever else you'd like.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.910
On him.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.190
Enjoy.

04:09.220 --> 04:10.900
Is this the garbage truck's route?

04:10.900 --> 04:14.290
I stopped all the rest of the
morning garbage collection.

04:14.290 --> 04:17.899
We got rookies diving into every
dumpster within a 3-mile radius of here,

04:17.899 --> 04:19.200
looking for the rest of the body.

04:19.200 --> 04:23.060
Did S.I.D. Find anything in that
dumpster that might tell us who our head is?

04:23.060 --> 04:26.520
Other than a humidifier,busted ikea chair,
it all belongs to the diner.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.790
There's blood in there,
but it's from hamburgers and steaks.

04:28.790 --> 04:31.180
Ok. Lieutenant tao,could you head on back--

04:34.050 --> 04:36.560
Could you go back to the office,please.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.980
And search the missing person's
database for a white male,

04:39.980 --> 04:43.270
early thirties,brown hair,brown eyes.
Height...

04:43.270 --> 04:45.490
he's at least 2 feet.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.830
Thank you.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.000
Hey!

04:50.600 --> 04:53.100
You guys know something we don't?

04:59.330 --> 05:02.370
I checked the inventory and this
is all we have on hand.

05:02.370 --> 05:05.300
Male body parts don't turn up all that often.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.990
It's usually the women that go to pieces.

05:09.830 --> 05:13.240
We--we did locate a bag of legs,but,uh,

05:13.610 --> 05:15.560
they turned out to be from northridge hospital.

05:15.560 --> 05:18.020
Well,the diner where we found
the head is close to cedars-sinai.

05:18.020 --> 05:20.040
No,this wasn't done by a surgeon.

05:20.040 --> 05:24.060
No,this head was cut off in one continuous
lateral motion by a rotating blade.

05:24.060 --> 05:25.890
Hmm,probably used a chainsaw.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.540
Was our victim alive when his head was removed?

05:28.540 --> 05:30.530
Uh,decapitations can be tricky

05:30.530 --> 05:35.020
because it's a procedure
that in most cases will kill a person,so...

05:36.500 --> 05:37.830
thank you.

05:37.830 --> 05:41.990
In this case,because there was such minor
hemorrhaging in the soft tissue around the neck,

05:41.990 --> 05:44.990
I have to believe that the heart was not
pumping blood when the head was severed.

05:44.990 --> 05:46.580
Can you give us a time of death?

05:46.580 --> 05:51.290
Well,considering the low-level of decomp,
the skin is still a good color,the eyes are intact.

05:51.290 --> 05:54.530
I'd say he died well within the,uh,
last 48 hours.

05:54.530 --> 05:56.520
He put up a hell of a fight,though.

05:56.520 --> 06:01.080
We found some foreign skin tissue
in the back of his mouth.

06:01.970 --> 06:06.010
I mean,he struggled so hard,
he broke his 2 front teeth.

06:06.430 --> 06:09.160
How soon can you get the rest
of his teeth x-rayed?

06:09.160 --> 06:11.730
- An hour.
- I could bring them to you.

06:11.730 --> 06:14.400
Please don'T.
Bother,I mean.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.250
- Please don't bother.
- I'll come pick them up.

06:17.250 --> 06:18.490
Thank you.

06:18.490 --> 06:22.190
This also might narrow down who your victim was.

06:22.690 --> 06:26.000
See,every since the late eighties
whenever we find an unidentified body or

06:26.000 --> 06:29.940
body part in west hollywood,
we perform an aids test.

06:32.820 --> 06:34.910
He has hiv.

06:34.910 --> 06:36.920
He looks familiar.

06:36.920 --> 06:39.050
I feel like I've seen this guy before.

06:39.420 --> 06:43.230
I've put calls out to hospices
and hiv clinics in west hollywood.

06:43.230 --> 06:45.970
That's a good idea.
Maybe he's an outpatient.

06:48.820 --> 06:49.980
Maybe he is.

06:49.980 --> 06:52.990
Chances are whoever he is,he has some priors.

06:52.990 --> 06:57.200
Now,mild citizens don't usually
end up with their heads in dumpsters.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.880
But his dna isn't in our database.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.050
I have seen him before.

07:03.170 --> 07:04.940
He's an actor.

07:04.940 --> 07:06.870
Remember any movies he might have been in?

07:06.870 --> 07:08.900
I sure do.

07:16.130 --> 07:18.160
You know why I hate porn?

07:18.160 --> 07:21.110
Guy delivers pizza,it never gets eaten.

07:21.110 --> 07:24.470
Girl's refrigerator breaks,it never gets fixed.

07:24.470 --> 07:27.750
Yeah,it's really unsatisfying.

07:27.750 --> 07:30.140
No wonder he's a star.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.000
Does he have a name?

07:35.630 --> 07:38.180
Buck...shot. Ahem.

07:38.180 --> 07:42.010
I doubt that buck shot was
the name given to him at birth.

07:42.010 --> 07:44.970
Can we find his real name and address,please?

07:45.430 --> 07:47.260
Thank you.

07:57.170 --> 07:58.880
A minivan.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.710
How many porn stars live here?

08:04.310 --> 08:06.010
Coming.

08:06.870 --> 08:08.560
I'M...

08:08.930 --> 08:13.360
I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson
and this is sergeant gabriel of the L.A.P.D.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.700
Do you know a christopher david mundy?

08:15.700 --> 08:18.470
Chris? Yeah,that's my husband.

08:21.130 --> 08:23.630
Duncan,help finish feeding your sister.

08:23.630 --> 08:26.450
- Say please.
- Duncan,just do it.Come here.

08:30.030 --> 08:32.820
Where was the last time you saw your husband,
mrs. Mundy?

08:32.820 --> 08:34.460
Saturday.

08:34.460 --> 08:37.250
He's up at a shoot in,uh,chatsworth.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.380
Why,was there a raid?
Oscar didn't call me.

08:40.380 --> 08:41.770
Mom,he has a gun!

08:41.770 --> 08:44.530
Duncan,come sit down.
Do you want some cereal? Come on.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.420
Uh,oscar?

08:50.420 --> 08:53.580
Yeah,oscar bloom.
He's a big director over at opulence films.

08:53.580 --> 08:55.100
You know who they are,right?

08:55.100 --> 08:58.780
Uh,sure. They're the adult film company.

08:58.780 --> 09:00.240
Sit down,honey.
Sit down.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.500
They've had some trouble lately
hiring younger girls,

09:02.500 --> 09:06.700
but I'm sure whatever's going on
now was just a big misunderstanding.

09:07.310 --> 09:09.540
So,uh,what do we do?

09:09.540 --> 09:12.530
Do I have to go downtown with you?
Can I bring my kids? What?

09:12.530 --> 09:16.820
Just for right now,we just need you
to sign right here.Please.

09:21.170 --> 09:23.180
It's ok,honey.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.240
Ok,baby.

09:29.420 --> 09:32.840
Uh,wait a minute.
"Release of medical information."

09:33.300 --> 09:37.030
Basically it just gives us access
to your husband's dental records.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.470
What?
What's going on here exactly?

09:41.470 --> 09:43.640
We're conducting,um...

09:45.070 --> 09:48.150
we're conducting a murder investigation,mrs. Mundy.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.220
Duncan!
Knock that off.

09:52.220 --> 09:55.340
We haven't--
we haven't positively identified the victim,

09:55.340 --> 09:59.160
but we--that's why we need your
husband's dental records.

09:59.160 --> 10:02.070
If you have a toothbrush or a hairbrush--

10:02.070 --> 10:04.670
my husband is in chatsworth.

10:05.490 --> 10:07.030
Oh,it's ok.
It's ok.

10:07.030 --> 10:10.020
I'll call him.He's probably just stuck on the road.
Here,hold her for a minute.

10:10.020 --> 10:12.340
I'll give him a call.
Thank you.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.340
Hi,honey. It's me.

10:18.340 --> 10:21.070
Can you call me as soon as you
get the message,please?

10:21.070 --> 10:23.880
Ok. I love you.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.240
He's probably stuck on the road or something.

10:34.230 --> 10:38.120
Baby,it's me again. Ok.
Call me as soon as you can. All right?

10:40.540 --> 10:43.590
He's fine.I promise.
You'll see.

10:56.010 --> 10:57.850
You don't like it.

10:58.230 --> 10:59.950
I love clams.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.440
And linguini.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.680
That's good,'cause that's one of
the 4 things I know how to cook.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.860
Oh,no thanks.

11:08.530 --> 11:10.400
But you try it.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.810
What,you went through so much trouble.

11:12.810 --> 11:15.360
Kitchen'll never be the same.

11:15.850 --> 11:17.820
Let me get you a glass of wine.

11:17.820 --> 11:21.580
Oh,no,thank you.
I'm not drinking tonight.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.400
My stomach's been upset all day.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.420
Yeah? Half my office is out with stomach flu.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.000
I think it's this case.

11:31.540 --> 11:33.370
It's that bad?

11:38.960 --> 11:40.740
A head was...

11:41.400 --> 11:44.690
it was severed at the c7.

11:45.770 --> 11:47.110
Oh,the...

11:48.070 --> 11:50.100
excuse me.

11:52.160 --> 11:55.770
It's not the head that bothers me or the feet.

11:55.770 --> 11:57.260
Feet?

11:59.560 --> 12:02.280
What's hard is that that head had a wife...

12:03.480 --> 12:05.660
and 2 kids.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.790
Yeah,that is rough.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.820
Kids. Huh.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.410
- It looks fantastic.
- Good.

12:43.070 --> 12:45.440
Ok. Ok.

12:47.050 --> 12:49.400
I know.I know.

12:49.930 --> 12:52.540
It's ok.
It's ok.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.810
My husband hasn't come home.

13:05.460 --> 13:07.680
I'm very sorry,annalisa,

13:07.680 --> 13:10.160
but the coroner has confirmed that the dental records

13:10.160 --> 13:13.820
you provided positively identified
the person we found as your husband.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.310
No,that can't be.

13:16.310 --> 13:18.390
It can't be.

13:18.390 --> 13:21.180
Where is he?
I have to see him.

13:26.980 --> 13:33.350
so far,all we've recovered of your
husband is his head and feet.

13:33.850 --> 13:36.270
Oh,god,no.

13:37.180 --> 13:39.790
Annalisa,please,have a seat.

13:41.470 --> 13:44.250
Were you with him this weekend in chatsworth?

13:44.440 --> 13:47.440
I have 2 kids if you haven't noticed.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.680
I was where I always am all weekend-- home.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.250
Can anyone verify that?

13:54.190 --> 13:56.900
What,do you think that
I had something to do with my hu...

13:57.350 --> 14:00.650
oh,don't for one minute--

14:01.520 --> 14:06.540
don't you sit there all high and mighty
in your churchy dress and accuse me--

14:06.540 --> 14:08.800
these are routine questions that we always ask.

14:08.800 --> 14:12.410
We are trying to learn as much as possible
about the events surrounding your husband's--

14:12.410 --> 14:15.550
don't you say it!
Don't say it!

14:18.020 --> 14:20.460
Can't this be--
my husband is--

14:20.460 --> 14:24.070
I can't even say it and you think that I did it?

14:24.930 --> 14:28.060
How long has your husband been hiv positive?

14:29.020 --> 14:32.340
- What?
- How long has your husband been hiv positive?

14:33.990 --> 14:36.780
If that body,or whatever parts of it you have,

14:36.780 --> 14:39.670
are hiv positive,then it's not my husband.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.360
My husband is negative.

14:43.060 --> 14:44.440
Hey,mom,they have some really cool--

14:44.440 --> 14:46.920
- we're leaving right now.
- But I don't want to go!

14:46.920 --> 14:48.440
Duncan.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.010
When was the last time you were tested?

14:51.010 --> 14:52.830
18 months ago when I had dakota.

14:52.830 --> 14:56.210
Then we'd like to test you again if that's ok.

14:56.210 --> 15:00.230
My kids are perfectly healthy and so am I.

15:00.230 --> 15:04.800
You have made a mistake,a horrible,
horrible mistake.

15:07.430 --> 15:10.730
Chris is not hiv positive.

15:10.730 --> 15:14.100
He gets tested every month at fits.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.790
Come on.
Let's go,duncan.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.370
Let's go find your daddy.

15:20.690 --> 15:22.680
What's fits?

15:23.110 --> 15:26.580
Chris mundy's wife waived confidentiality
of his medical records.

15:26.580 --> 15:29.190
No worries.
Christopher david mundy.

15:29.190 --> 15:30.860
This will only take a moment.

15:30.860 --> 15:33.680
Are you familiar with chris mundy's work?

15:33.680 --> 15:36.440
Don't really watch our clients' movies.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.850
It's not my thing.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.360
I just draw their blood.

15:41.790 --> 15:43.160
Is your lab here?

15:43.160 --> 15:45.290
No,we send the blood to a lab in burbank.

15:45.290 --> 15:48.780
They shoot us the results the next business day,
then we post them online.

15:48.780 --> 15:52.240
Do you also call your clients with their results?

15:52.240 --> 15:55.820
No,our clients have tlog into
the system to get them.

15:56.130 --> 15:58.200
They can't work unless they have
a clean bill of health.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.840
Here you go.
And for...

16:00.840 --> 16:05.370
for how long do you keep your clients' tests results?

16:05.370 --> 16:07.600
Only 6 months.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.980
And for the last 6 months,chris mundy's been clean.

16:10.980 --> 16:12.620
Clean for what?

16:12.620 --> 16:16.590
Hiv,gonorrhea,chlamydia,syphilis.

16:16.590 --> 16:19.560
Negative,negative,negative,negative.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.140
Positive.

16:21.140 --> 16:23.910
I'm positive that the person I identified is chris mundy.

16:23.910 --> 16:26.860
The dental records that his wife gave
us were a perfect match.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.940
Well,how did you determine the head had hiv?

16:28.940 --> 16:31.790
We did this procedure where we swab
the inside of his cheek.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.480
It's the kind of test that gives
us the results rapidly.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.100
- What's it called?
- Rapid hiv test.

16:38.390 --> 16:41.320
Fits tested chris mundy a week ago.

16:41.320 --> 16:44.410
Now,is it possible that he contracted
the virus in the last 7 days?

16:44.410 --> 16:46.470
Well,our cheek swab test isn't that sensitive.

16:46.470 --> 16:48.940
In order for it to detect hiv
antibodies in chris mundy,

16:48.940 --> 16:51.890
he would have had to have hiv
for at least a month.

16:51.890 --> 16:53.730
Ah...

16:58.280 --> 17:00.130
Don't go anywhere.

17:04.410 --> 17:06.960
So what's your porn name?

17:07.700 --> 17:09.150
Excuse me?

17:09.150 --> 17:10.290
Everyone has one.

17:10.290 --> 17:14.119
You take the name of your first pet and combine
it with the first street you lived on.

17:14.119 --> 17:17.210
My porn name's muffy brewer.

17:18.849 --> 17:21.849
- I'm light saber central.
- That's a good one.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.330
Lucky.

17:31.330 --> 17:33.560
Lucky what?

17:33.560 --> 17:37.040
I am sure I had the right person,
but I'm not sure that fits does.

17:37.040 --> 17:41.440
See,they say that chris mundy's
blood type was type o,

17:41.440 --> 17:45.850
but the head that you found in the
dumpster was type ab positive.

17:47.830 --> 17:51.520
Chris mundy had somebody take
his blood tests for him.

17:55.060 --> 17:57.870
Maybe nobody knew he had hiv.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.060
Hi,we're looking for oscar bloom.

18:00.060 --> 18:04.360
Oh,um,oscar's down the hall.
First door on the left.You can just go on in.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.600
Thank you.

18:13.990 --> 18:15.710
Oh,I'm sorry.

18:15.710 --> 18:17.900
Cut. Cut.
Cut. Cut. Cut.

18:21.740 --> 18:24.530
We were hoping to have a word with oscar bloom.

18:25.380 --> 18:27.290
That's me.

18:29.620 --> 18:32.200
When was the last time you saw chris mundy?

18:32.580 --> 18:35.950
Uh,he was supposed to do a photo shoot in
chatsworth over the weekend,but he never showed.

18:35.950 --> 18:37.760
Can't say that's the first time that's ever happened.

18:37.760 --> 18:40.260
But when chris is on his game,he's a great guy.

18:40.260 --> 18:42.530
That man has a very special talent.

18:42.530 --> 18:44.200
And what would that be?

18:44.200 --> 18:46.600
Well,off drugs,he can make wood anytime,anywhere.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.640
Do you know how rare that is?

18:48.640 --> 18:52.230
It's like being able to cry on cue...
out of one eye.

18:52.230 --> 18:54.840
So you're saying chris had a big drug problem?

18:54.840 --> 18:57.700
Well,he really tried to clean up
his life after he became a dad.

18:57.700 --> 19:00.350
Look,I don't wanna say anything bad about the guy,
but he was in rehab twice.

19:00.350 --> 19:02.500
Heroin,you know.
It's a bitch to kick.

19:02.500 --> 19:06.180
Prior to the movie in chatsworth,
when was the last time you worked with chris mundy?

19:06.180 --> 19:09.230
A few days before on raymond loves everybody.

19:09.230 --> 19:11.670
And did you check his hiv status then?

19:11.670 --> 19:13.060
Yeah,and it was negative.

19:13.060 --> 19:16.720
I don't even roll the camera unless
I see my performers latest test results.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.240
Do your male performers use condoms?

19:19.240 --> 19:21.460
Testing's our prophylactic.

19:21.460 --> 19:24.010
Health department send you guys down here?

19:24.010 --> 19:28.390
I'm sorry to tell you that yesterday chris mundy
was found dead.

19:28.850 --> 19:30.300
Was he using again?

19:30.300 --> 19:32.530
We're not sure why he was murdered.

19:32.530 --> 19:34.480
Murdered?

19:35.290 --> 19:38.420
Mom!
Mom,I need you in here.

19:39.310 --> 19:40.850
What?

19:40.850 --> 19:42.980
Honey,what is it?

19:43.610 --> 19:46.030
Chris mundy was murdered.

19:46.030 --> 19:48.820
What?
How awful.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.920
These are the police.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.300
I'm morgan bloom.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.910
I,uh,I own opulence films.

19:56.910 --> 20:01.030
When the coroner did an hiv test on chris,
it came up positive.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.380
There's no way.

20:03.380 --> 20:06.080
We believe that chris mundy
had been faking his results.

20:06.080 --> 20:09.720
The blood type that fits had on
record does not match chris mundy.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.360
He was lying about his hiv status?

20:12.360 --> 20:14.540
- For how long?
- We're not sure.

20:14.540 --> 20:17.870
His wife says she tested negative 18 months ago.

20:17.870 --> 20:22.910
So in the past year and a half,every person chris
had sex with,he's passed the virus along to them.

20:22.910 --> 20:25.470
Every time they had sex with somebody,
they could have passed the virus on to--

20:25.470 --> 20:28.420
which might give someone a very good
reason to want chris mundy dead.

20:28.420 --> 20:31.650
Do you have any idea how many people
we're talking about here?

20:45.550 --> 20:47.410
Oh,my god.

20:50.970 --> 20:52.290
You want us to do what?

20:52.290 --> 20:55.240
Shut down production.
2 weeks,no porn.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.390
It's impossible.

20:56.390 --> 20:58.750
Impossible to stop all production in the L.A. Base.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.030
You represent opulence films.

21:01.030 --> 21:04.260
And from what I understand,opulence
films sets the industry standard.

21:04.260 --> 21:07.130
If your company shuts down,everyone shuts down.

21:07.130 --> 21:09.730
Naked people are being filmed in every attic,

21:09.730 --> 21:12.540
every car,and every swing set in the valley.

21:12.540 --> 21:14.180
No one can keep that from happening.

21:14.180 --> 21:15.810
We have to try.

21:15.810 --> 21:20.550
Chris mundy's sexual partners could be
unknowingly spreading that virus right now.

21:20.550 --> 21:25.620
I understand that,but a prolonged shutdown
would be a financial catastrophe for los angeles.

21:25.620 --> 21:30.260
The adult film industry pays $52 million
in taxes to this city every year.

21:30.760 --> 21:35.080
So how many people have to drop dead before
human loss outweighs city revenue?

21:35.490 --> 21:38.810
Or are sex workers disposable because
of how they earn a living?

21:38.810 --> 21:40.720
I'm just asking.

21:40.720 --> 21:43.010
Can we localize the shutdown?

21:43.010 --> 21:45.820
Chris mundy was exclusive to opulence.

21:45.820 --> 21:48.640
Do you have a record of all the people
he worked with in the past--

21:48.640 --> 21:50.430
18 months.

21:50.430 --> 21:51.860
We do.

21:51.860 --> 21:54.190
Then how many people would that be?

21:56.030 --> 21:58.200
238 girls.

22:05.270 --> 22:07.630
We'll shut it down for 2 weeks.

22:08.780 --> 22:10.390
Thank you.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.160
What else do you need?

22:12.160 --> 22:15.620
I need the real names of the 238 women.

22:15.620 --> 22:17.090
All right.

22:17.090 --> 22:20.790
I can promise you the full support of
the valley divisions to help you find them.

22:20.790 --> 22:21.510
Thank you.

22:21.510 --> 22:24.350
All right,gentlemen,I think we're done here.
Thank you.

22:25.340 --> 22:27.760
Chief johnson,a word.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.500
Since when does sex make you so irritable?

22:34.500 --> 22:39.620
I have no problem with loving,responsible,
2 people in the dark sex.

22:40.020 --> 22:44.790
I have a problem with the stupid,
irresponsible mistakes people make.

22:45.510 --> 22:49.680
Seems to me your murder victim was very
deliberate in his irresponsible--

22:49.680 --> 22:51.980
I think I'm pregnant.

22:56.240 --> 22:59.270
Uh,I take it congratulations are not in order.

23:02.180 --> 23:04.820
You might be pregnant or

23:05.510 --> 23:07.430
you are pregnant?

23:07.430 --> 23:09.750
I haven't taken a test.

23:11.810 --> 23:14.720
What does fritz have to say about all this?

23:15.330 --> 23:16.750
He,um--

23:17.840 --> 23:20.320
I haven't told him yet.

23:23.420 --> 23:28.100
And you're telling me this after
a dinner at which you told me

23:28.100 --> 23:32.890
you need this relationship to remain
strictly a professional friendship?

23:34.990 --> 23:40.870
I know that you don't really understand
the boundaries of friendship very well.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.890
I know this hard for you.
I get it.

23:45.390 --> 23:47.370
And I--I--

23:48.910 --> 23:52.520
I cannot have this conversation with you.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.760
For my sake.

23:58.660 --> 24:00.170
Really. Ok?

24:00.390 --> 24:02.850
- Nothing personal.
- Sure.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.040
It's not personal.

24:21.350 --> 24:23.220
Yes,lieutenant.

24:24.020 --> 24:28.130
Of the 238 women chris mundy slept with,
some have left the business,

24:28.130 --> 24:30.130
some have gone home,some are in rehab.

24:30.130 --> 24:33.680
Any number of them are unaccounted for.
So it's gonna take some time to find 'em.

24:33.680 --> 24:39.650
Which is why we only have 4 women
for you to talk to.

24:40.860 --> 24:43.080
Any of them look promising?

24:43.080 --> 24:44.730
Uh,yeah.

24:44.730 --> 24:46.610
Uh,yeah. One.

24:47.130 --> 24:51.370
Uh,rap sheet says she's got 5 counts
of battery,2 drug possessions.

24:51.370 --> 24:55.110
She also resisted an arrest
and assaulted an officer.

24:55.900 --> 24:57.400
Thank you.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.100
Evelyn howard.

24:59.100 --> 25:00.900
Call her layla.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.840
We certainly wouldn't want to upset her.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.910
I do not have a problem with rage.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.610
Did you know chris mundy's hiv status?

25:08.610 --> 25:10.500
Well,I wouldn't have worked with
him if he was positive.

25:10.500 --> 25:12.500
- He was.
- Yeah. That's a load of bull--

25:12.500 --> 25:16.720
layla,I have a theory that chris mundy
lied to a lot of people about his hiv status,

25:16.720 --> 25:21.010
and when someone found out that
he infected them during a work...session,

25:21.370 --> 25:23.770
well,it could be the end of
life as they knew it and

25:23.770 --> 25:26.540
that could make this person very,very mad.

25:26.540 --> 25:28.450
I did not kill chris mundy!

25:28.450 --> 25:30.800
And he didn't give me hiv!

25:30.800 --> 25:32.100
Look.

25:33.120 --> 25:36.190
I got tested at fits 3 days ago.

25:37.630 --> 25:39.530
How can we be sure these are your results?

25:39.530 --> 25:41.430
Oh,please.

25:41.430 --> 25:45.220
You gotta show proof of I.D.
Before they stick that needle in your arm.

25:45.850 --> 25:48.080
How well do they check your I.D. At fits?

25:48.080 --> 25:51.050
We check client's I.D.S when they come in,
make sure they're real.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.850
Well,do you check the I.D.S against
anything other than the client's face?

25:54.850 --> 25:56.190
Well,the first time a client comes in,

25:56.190 --> 25:59.200
we make a copy of their driver's
license and keep it on file.

25:59.200 --> 26:04.100
Does this xerox match the license
you have on file for chris mundy?

26:04.670 --> 26:06.520
Let me see.

26:06.520 --> 26:10.170
I don't think I ever drew his blood.
Frank always took care of him.

26:11.190 --> 26:14.150
Well,business is sure brisk around here.

26:14.150 --> 26:16.210
We're usually standing room only.

26:16.210 --> 26:19.930
Now,thanks to you all,no one wants to come here.
They don't trust us.

26:23.070 --> 26:26.500
Now,why wouldn't people trust you?

26:30.500 --> 26:35.930
This idea that my husband was paying
someone to take his tests is crazy.

26:37.070 --> 26:41.220
This is the man who was taking
the tests for your husband.

26:42.730 --> 26:44.910
You recognize him?

26:45.910 --> 26:48.550
I've never seen this man before.

26:49.830 --> 26:52.100
He didn't have hiv.

26:52.100 --> 26:55.770
Then you won't mind if we do a
quick hiv test on you right now.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.970
You can do a cheek...

26:59.660 --> 27:01.720
swab.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.620
You can do it right here.

27:04.620 --> 27:07.300
I don't need to take a test.

27:07.300 --> 27:10.770
You don't want me to find out
that you have hiv,do you?

27:10.770 --> 27:14.370
Because that would suddenly give you a
very good reason for killing your husband.

27:14.970 --> 27:18.980
My husband did not have aids,and neither do I.

27:19.510 --> 27:23.300
You can only live in denial for so long,annalisa.

27:23.750 --> 27:26.460
The body is going to do what it'S...

27:27.060 --> 27:29.470
going to do without...

27:31.560 --> 27:34.720
waiting for your brain to catch up.

27:37.900 --> 27:42.170
If what you're saying is true,if it is,

27:43.130 --> 27:46.660
I haven't been in the business since I had kids.

27:48.090 --> 27:50.740
Who's gonna hire me?

27:51.020 --> 27:54.120
Who's gonna pay for my treatments? My kids?

27:54.120 --> 27:55.900
I mean,we don't have any money.

27:55.900 --> 27:58.220
Your husband didn't have life insurance?

27:58.220 --> 28:01.470
He tried to get it.
They turned him down.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.060
When?

28:03.060 --> 28:05.930
Last week,chris mundy was denied life insurance.

28:05.930 --> 28:08.240
Insurance companies always do a blood test.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.040
They would have found out he was hiv positive.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.700
Now,wait,wait.
Hold on a minute.

28:11.700 --> 28:15.720
If you have somebody else take your
hiv test for you once a month--

28:15.720 --> 28:19.160
why not have that someone take your
blood test for the insurance company?

28:19.160 --> 28:23.170
The only way you'd let them draw your own blood
is if you thought you were perfectly healthy.

28:23.170 --> 28:26.690
Chris mundy didn't know he had hiv.

28:27.650 --> 28:30.520
I bet someone at the lab did.

28:34.420 --> 28:36.780
Where's the other guy that works here? Frank?

28:36.780 --> 28:39.570
The guy you said drew chris mundy's blood.

28:39.570 --> 28:42.370
Haven't seen him since you all shut us down.

28:45.910 --> 28:47.430
Put 'em up!

28:52.220 --> 28:54.280
- Kitchen clear!
- All clear!

28:54.280 --> 28:56.720
- Checking patio!
- Clear!

28:57.370 --> 28:58.960
Dresser and closet are empty.

28:58.960 --> 29:00.800
So are the bathroom cabinets.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.880
Our phlebotomist flew the coop.

29:02.880 --> 29:06.880
Well,he didn't fly away alone.
Don't they make a lovely couple?

29:07.770 --> 29:09.650
They have a $7,500 fridge.

29:09.650 --> 29:11.660
And their television's brand new.

29:11.660 --> 29:14.660
Who knew lab rats made such a good living?

29:14.660 --> 29:17.990
Hey. Got a good idea where the
extra income's coming from.

29:17.990 --> 29:21.110
Looks like he was on opulence's payroll,too.

29:23.530 --> 29:26.350
Chris mundy may not have been aware he had hiv,

29:26.350 --> 29:28.200
but his killer might have known.

29:28.200 --> 29:32.440
Sergeant,could you please call around to every E.R.
Within a 5-mile radius of the diner,

29:32.440 --> 29:36.980
and see if anyone came in over the weekend
requesting treatment for exposure to hiv?

29:36.980 --> 29:41.520
And please ask lieutenant tao to call
the morgue about chris mundy's mouth.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.090
Thank you.

30:26.290 --> 30:27.550
So chief...

30:27.550 --> 30:31.760
since january,the lab tech has been
receiving a monthly $10,000

30:31.760 --> 30:35.600
consultant fee from a shell company
that I traced back to opulence films.

30:35.600 --> 30:39.240
Morgan bloom is on her way down here with her son oscar.
She wouldn't let him come down here alone.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.260
When the blooms arrive,please separate them,

30:41.260 --> 30:44.500
and if they insist on using the same lawyer,
please have him sign a waiver.

30:44.500 --> 30:47.910
I refuse to have this case thrown out
because of ineffective assistance of counsel.

30:47.910 --> 30:51.180
Thank you. Uh,I think we're done with those.

30:51.180 --> 30:52.540
I thought we could keep these.

30:52.540 --> 30:54.550
Uh,you were misinformed.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.690
Is that it?

30:58.270 --> 30:59.980
Special delivery.

30:59.980 --> 31:02.730
Straight from the morgue.

31:03.980 --> 31:06.620
We won't be answering any of
your questions,chief johnson.

31:06.620 --> 31:09.950
That's quite all right. Lieutenant tao
and i have plenty we could talk about.

31:09.950 --> 31:12.500
Like what was in chris mundy's mouth?

31:12.500 --> 31:16.300
Chris mundy had someone else's skin
embedded in his molars.

31:16.300 --> 31:19.970
And the blood we found under his
tongue was not his blood type.

31:19.970 --> 31:22.060
- What was it?
- Blood type "b".

31:22.060 --> 31:24.070
Isn't that your blood type,mr. Bloom?

31:24.070 --> 31:26.920
- I don't know what my blood type--
- oscar,you're gonna remain silent.

31:27.650 --> 31:31.290
And what conclusions would you
draw from this evidence?

31:31.290 --> 31:35.030
Chris mundy took a bite out of
whoever killed him.

31:35.030 --> 31:38.890
Probably the forearm,because chris mundy's
two front teeth were broken,

31:38.890 --> 31:43.120
and there's not too many places on the human body
where you can bite down and hit bone.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.040
Roll up your sleeve,mr. Bloom.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.390
Don't you guys need a warrant?

31:46.390 --> 31:49.860
I don't need a warrant to search your body,
you could be concealing a weapon.

31:49.860 --> 31:51.720
Roll up your sleeve,mr. Bloom,

31:51.720 --> 31:56.010
or I will find several large uniformed
personnel to do it for you.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.550
Go ahead.

32:13.770 --> 32:16.340
Would you like to do the honors,lieutenant tao?

32:16.340 --> 32:18.700
I'd be delighted.

32:29.730 --> 32:32.900
This is a cast of chris mundy's mouth.

32:37.100 --> 32:40.590
It should fit the bite marks he left on the killer.

32:44.860 --> 32:47.490
now,if you rotate your arm like so...

32:47.490 --> 32:50.600
you can see how he broke
his teeth on your radius bone.

32:50.600 --> 32:54.280
Did you shove your arm in his
mouth to quiet his screams?

32:55.070 --> 32:56.030
Don't talk,oscar--

32:56.030 --> 32:58.010
- I had to defend myself.
- Oscar!

32:58.010 --> 33:02.130
He showed up at my office out of his mind,
high on drugs,demanding cash.

33:02.130 --> 33:04.780
That's when he got violent with me,
I had to fight back.

33:04.780 --> 33:07.390
- Did you kill chris mundy?
- Not a word.

33:08.930 --> 33:11.980
I will be filing murder charges today,
mr. Catalina,and

33:11.980 --> 33:15.170
I will need your help in deciding
whether I charge oscar by himself,

33:15.170 --> 33:17.430
- or oscar and his mother.
- Excuse me?

33:17.430 --> 33:20.310
Oh,come now.
This is hardly sophie's choice.

33:20.310 --> 33:22.860
Morgan bloom knew nothing about
chris mundy's death.

33:22.860 --> 33:25.610
You had a hard time keeping oscar
from telling me what happened,

33:25.610 --> 33:28.590
I find it hard to believe that his
mother would be out of the loop.

33:42.630 --> 33:45.280
How much did opulence films gross last year?

33:45.280 --> 33:47.340
7.2 million.

33:47.340 --> 33:49.000
Gosh,that's a lot.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.200
And are you the sole owner?

33:52.780 --> 33:56.810
She is. She took the company over
5 years ago after her divorce.

33:57.340 --> 33:59.400
And how much did the company make that year?

33:59.400 --> 34:02.190
$435,000.

34:03.670 --> 34:06.380
Sounds like you put in a lot of hard work.

34:06.380 --> 34:09.250
And how much of that profit did
chris mundy generate?

34:09.250 --> 34:12.650
Chris mundy is one of their top
selling male actors.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.250
What a loss.

34:15.250 --> 34:18.210
Your son really made your life
difficult when he killed chris mundy.

34:18.210 --> 34:19.000
Chief johnson...

34:19.000 --> 34:23.550
I have to wonder,is that something that
you wanted,or did your son act on his own?

34:25.610 --> 34:28.380
It's your choice not to answer my questions,

34:28.380 --> 34:31.600
mrs. Bloom,but I think it's the wrong one.

34:31.600 --> 34:35.370
Because I think your son killed
chris all by himself.

34:35.780 --> 34:37.540
And here's why.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.830
Chris' hands and feet were cut off
in one continuous motion,

34:41.830 --> 34:45.520
which means that the chainsaw that was
used had to have been at least 18 inches.

34:45.520 --> 34:48.070
A chainsaw that size has one heck of a kickback.

34:48.070 --> 34:50.690
I would think it would be more
than you could handle.

34:50.690 --> 34:55.460
But until I know the truth,
I will have to keep digging.

34:55.460 --> 34:59.800
And that means taking a good,
long look into opulence films.

34:59.800 --> 35:03.100
Can your business handle being
turned inside out?

35:03.100 --> 35:07.640
It will be a shame to lose everything
after you worked so hard.

35:07.880 --> 35:11.500
You didn't get to where you are today by
being the type of person who makes mistakes.

35:11.500 --> 35:15.860
It would be a mistake not to tell me what happened.

35:20.010 --> 35:22.460
If my client tells the truth,

35:22.460 --> 35:26.480
do you promise not to file charges
against her regarding this murder?

35:27.640 --> 35:29.340
Yes.

35:30.740 --> 35:34.250
Oscar had to defend himself against this madman.

35:34.820 --> 35:37.880
Any jury will be able to see this.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.750
Listen to your lawyer,mrs. Bloom.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.990
Be good to my son.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.960
He doesn't know what he's doing half the time.

35:51.960 --> 35:54.250
He's such a mess.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.270
Oscar...

35:57.270 --> 36:00.500
killed chris mundy all by himself.

36:00.840 --> 36:03.300
It was saturday afternoon.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.740
I was home.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.570
He called me from the office.

36:09.030 --> 36:12.610
He told me that he and chris
had gotten into a fight,and he...

36:12.990 --> 36:16.800
stabbed chris with one of our trophies.

36:17.540 --> 36:20.210
And then what did your son do?

36:23.660 --> 36:29.070
He used a chainsaw that we had lying
around after one of our shoots

36:29.720 --> 36:33.470
to disassemble the body.

36:34.470 --> 36:36.680
And then oscar...

36:37.040 --> 36:40.790
dumped various parts of
chris mundy all over town.

36:40.790 --> 36:42.440
I think we're done here.

36:42.440 --> 36:45.270
Uh,no,no,just one more detail.

36:46.170 --> 36:49.910
When did you know that chris mundy
was hiv positive?

36:52.580 --> 36:55.180
When you came to my son's office.

37:02.250 --> 37:04.390
Your mother gave you up.

37:04.390 --> 37:06.720
She would never do that.

37:07.380 --> 37:10.800
Which trophy did you use to stab
chris mundy to death?

37:12.760 --> 37:13.930
Bitch.

37:13.930 --> 37:16.810
- You're gonna plead self defense,oscar.
- You let her talk?

37:17.570 --> 37:19.470
Should your mother go to jail for
a murder she didn't commit?

37:19.470 --> 37:22.850
You know what,you never liked me in the first place!
Why don't you just get out of here?

37:23.630 --> 37:24.810
Get the hell out of here!

37:24.810 --> 37:27.650
- Fine. You're on your own.
- Good!

37:30.010 --> 37:31.920
Would you like another lawyer,mr. Bloom?

37:31.920 --> 37:33.950
Fat lot of good they do me.

37:33.950 --> 37:35.600
Look,it's like I said--

37:35.600 --> 37:39.250
I killed chris,but it was in self defense.

37:39.250 --> 37:41.780
I believe you,oscar.

37:43.170 --> 37:44.530
Thank you.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.680
I'm just wondering one thing.

37:46.680 --> 37:50.190
When did you find out that chris mundy had hiv?

37:51.220 --> 37:53.110
I--I had no idea.

37:53.110 --> 37:57.910
Really? Because the night chris mundy died,
you went to hollywood presbyterian,

37:57.910 --> 38:02.040
and according to the E.R. Doctor on call,
you requested a treatment called "hart."

38:02.040 --> 38:04.410
Highly active anti-retroviral therapy,

38:04.410 --> 38:07.800
a drug cocktail administered after
exposure to hiv

38:08.450 --> 38:12.950
now,why would you request that treatment
if you didn't know that chris was hiv positive?

38:12.950 --> 38:15.110
Look,here's the deal--

38:15.680 --> 38:18.190
I called my mother after the thing with chris.

38:18.190 --> 38:19.970
That's when she told me he was positive.

38:19.970 --> 38:24.630
That's when she let me in on the fact that
she'd been faking his test results for months.

38:24.630 --> 38:29.230
So,you didn't find out until after you
killed chris mundy that he had hiv?

38:29.230 --> 38:30.850
That's the truth.

38:30.850 --> 38:33.770
- Then why did you kill him?
- I told you guys!

38:33.770 --> 38:37.040
He came into my office,he started swinging at me,

38:37.040 --> 38:38.730
he was so strung out on heroin--

38:38.730 --> 38:41.660
heroin is the one thing
chris mundy tested negative for,

38:41.660 --> 38:44.560
so let's go over your story one more time.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.490
Chris mundy came into your office.
He was upset.

38:47.490 --> 38:50.180
- That's what I keep telling you.
- But he was infuriated

38:50.180 --> 38:55.340
because the blood test that he had taken for
his insurance company revealed that he was hiv positive.

38:56.060 --> 38:58.340
He realized that the results of the blood tests

38:58.340 --> 39:01.150
he had been taking at fits were covered up by you.

39:01.150 --> 39:03.140
That's why you had to kill chris mundy,isn't it?

39:03.140 --> 39:06.690
You couldn't let him walk out the door,
open his mouth and tell the world what you'd done--

39:06.690 --> 39:08.100
what my mother did!

39:08.100 --> 39:12.470
4 months ago,she decided to hire these girls from
brazil because they were so much cheaper.

39:12.470 --> 39:15.540
We were in such a rush,she didn't even bother
checking their hiv status.

39:15.540 --> 39:20.100
She finds out that chris mundy tested positive
a month later after the lab called her.

39:20.100 --> 39:25.200
She paid the guy at the lab to toss out chris'
blood and replace it with his boyfriend'S.

39:25.200 --> 39:30.070
The only thing she ever cared about
was making our production dates,period!

39:42.280 --> 39:43.590
Can we go now?

39:43.590 --> 39:45.820
I just have one more detail to discuss with you.

39:45.820 --> 39:48.160
When you faked chris mundy's test results--

39:48.160 --> 39:50.500
I didn'T.
The lab did.

39:50.500 --> 39:55.360
But you paid the lab,according to the
statement that your son is signing right now.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.930
My son is a liar.

39:56.930 --> 39:58.650
It's on record that my client's off the hook--

39:58.650 --> 40:01.820
with respect to chris mundy's murder,yes,

40:01.820 --> 40:05.380
but chris mundy wasn't your client's only victim.

40:07.490 --> 40:10.210
This is chloe.

40:11.150 --> 40:13.350
She made a film with chris mundy 2 months ago,

40:13.350 --> 40:16.730
and this morning she tested positive for hiv

40:16.730 --> 40:19.220
as did jenny...

40:19.660 --> 40:22.350
and casey...

40:24.310 --> 40:25.770
tracy...

40:27.000 --> 40:28.590
gina...

40:29.830 --> 40:31.340
tara...

40:32.770 --> 40:35.540
ginger,heidi...

40:36.360 --> 40:38.350
jill,ivory,

40:38.350 --> 40:41.540
ebony,tiffany.

40:48.270 --> 40:51.480
You knowingly let an hiv positive man

40:51.480 --> 40:54.790
have unprotected sex with multiple partners.

40:55.490 --> 40:59.650
That is no different than pointing a
loaded gun at each one of these women's heads.

40:59.650 --> 41:03.250
Which is why I'm arresting you on
13 counts of assault

41:03.250 --> 41:06.900
with intent to commit great bodily harm.

41:08.380 --> 41:14.180
Which,with any luck,will keep you
in jail for the rest of my life.

41:19.390 --> 41:21.600
There's only 12 girls here.

41:24.430 --> 41:29.200
The 13th victim isn't currently
employed by opulence films.

41:32.500 --> 41:36.030
Her name is annalisa mundy.

41:36.670 --> 41:39.410
And she was chris' wife.

42:04.650 --> 42:06.300
You ready?

42:07.820 --> 42:09.850
Yes,I am.

42:11.150 --> 42:14.460
Can we stay in tonight,just lay low?

42:15.320 --> 42:18.740
I want to have the biggest glass
of merlot possible.

42:28.250 --> 42:30.570
So you're not pregnant?

42:36.790 --> 42:39.320
No.
No,I'm not.

42:39.760 --> 42:42.640
Were you ever gonna tell me that you might be?

42:42.640 --> 42:47.650
Well,I--I would if I was,but I'm not,

42:47.650 --> 42:50.610
so i just didn't think that it was worth mentioning.

42:50.610 --> 42:53.300
In a relationship,you mention things.

42:53.300 --> 42:56.130
If you trust the other person.

42:57.610 --> 42:59.500
Ok.

43:00.520 --> 43:03.890
From now on,I want to make sure that we

43:03.890 --> 43:09.580
guard against any accidental possible pregnancies.

43:15.370 --> 43:18.750
What about a pregnancy that happens on purpose?

43:23.940 --> 43:26.300
we just moved in together.

43:26.900 --> 43:28.960
We're not married yet.

43:28.960 --> 43:31.850
There's a certain order to things.

43:40.540 --> 43:43.620
But are you interested in having kids? At all?

43:49.380 --> 43:50.900
Maybe.

43:51.340 --> 43:53.860
But not tonight.
