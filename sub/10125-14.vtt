WEBVTT

00:09.600 --> 00:10.834
THAT'S GREAT, COR.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

00:10.834 --> 00:13.033
SEE YOU.

00:13.033 --> 00:15.300
CORY, WERE YOU JUST
TALKING TO TOPANGA?

00:15.300 --> 00:17.367
I WAS FEELING
A LITTLE CHATTY.

00:17.367 --> 00:20.100
EVEN THOUGH WE BROKE UP,
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.200
SHE'S YOUR EX.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.100
LET ME SPELL THAT
FOR YOU--"X"!

00:24.100 --> 00:26.967
TOPANGA AND I AREN'T
LIKE OTHER COUPLES.

00:26.967 --> 00:28.100
YOU'RE NOT A COUPLE!

00:28.100 --> 00:29.400
I KNOW!
MY POINT EXACTLY!

00:29.400 --> 00:30.500
THEN WE AGREE!

00:30.500 --> 00:34.033
NO. I THINK WE'RE SAYING
THE SAME THING.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.667
CORY, I DOUBLE-CHECKED.

00:35.667 --> 00:38.300
THE PROM-WEAR
FASHION FEST
IS AT 3:00.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.567
FASHION FEST?

00:39.567 --> 00:43.834
YEAH. CORY AND I ARE MODELING
FORMAL WEAR FOR THE PROM.

00:43.834 --> 00:47.500
ISN'T IT GREAT WE CAN
STILL DO THINGS TOGETHER?

00:47.500 --> 00:49.000
OH, DON'T DO THAT.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.133
I'VE ALWAYS DONE THAT.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
SHAWN, ARE YOU CRYING?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.867
I THINK I LOST YOU, MAN.

00:56.867 --> 01:00.200
I AGREED TO THIS WHEN WE
WERE STILL GOING OUT.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.233
I CAN'T BAIL ON HER.

01:01.233 --> 01:04.200
YEAH, YOU CAN.
YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE ON.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.834
OH, QUIT YOUR CRYING.

01:05.834 --> 01:07.567
I'M A GUY IN A TUX

01:07.567 --> 01:10.300
WALKING WITH
HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND
IN A GOWN

01:10.300 --> 01:12.800
IN FRONT OF
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.367
AND YOU THINK I
HAVEN'T MOVED ON.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.133
IF YOU'RE
REALLY OVER HER,

01:17.133 --> 01:20.233
THEN YOU'RE READY
TO DATE OTHER GIRLS.

01:20.233 --> 01:21.367
I SHOULD SAY SO.

01:21.367 --> 01:23.500
YOU UP FOR
A DOUBLE-DATE?

01:23.500 --> 01:25.934
YES, BUT WHAT
WILL YOU DO, SHAWN?

01:25.934 --> 01:29.834
OH, NOW, THIS IS THE CORY
I'VE ALWAYS HOPED FOR.

01:29.834 --> 01:35.100
KATIE, MELISSA,
YOU WANT TO GO OUT
WITH ME AND CORY TONIGHT?

01:35.100 --> 01:36.233
SURE.

01:36.233 --> 01:37.967
THAT'D BE GREAT.

01:37.967 --> 01:41.033
COOL. WE JUST
GOT OURSELVES
A DOUBLE-DATE.

01:41.033 --> 01:43.300
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

01:43.300 --> 01:45.200
YOU GO.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.300
"PENN STATE,
OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS."

01:57.300 --> 01:58.900
OH, PLEASE, PLEASE,
COME ON.

01:58.900 --> 02:02.834
"DEAR ERIC MATTHEWS,
WE HAVE REVIEWED
YOUR APPLICATION,

02:02.834 --> 02:04.200
AND WE ARE VERY PLEASED
TO ANNOUNCE..."

02:04.200 --> 02:05.600
OH, YES!

02:05.600 --> 02:07.700
"WE'VE HAD
A RECORD NUMBER
OF APPLICANTS.

02:07.700 --> 02:10.133
"REGRETFULLY,
THERE'S NOT ROOM
FOR EVERYBODY.

02:10.133 --> 02:13.200
THEREFORE,
WE MUST REJECT
YOUR APPLICATION."

02:13.200 --> 02:15.400
I'M SORRY, MR. MATTHEWS.

02:15.400 --> 02:19.133
HEY, MR. FEENY,
DON'T BE SORRY FOR ME.

02:19.133 --> 02:20.300
I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED.

02:20.300 --> 02:23.367
WANT TO KNOW
WHY I CAME OUT
TO READ THE LETTER?

02:23.367 --> 02:24.467
IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS.

02:24.467 --> 02:27.467
MY PARENTS TAKE THESE
COLLEGE REJECTIONS HARD.

02:27.467 --> 02:28.467
I'M PROTECTING THEM.

02:28.467 --> 02:29.734
YEAH, ME? I'M FINE.

02:29.734 --> 02:33.233
YOU GET 30 OF THESE BABIES,
ROLLS RIGHT OFF YOU BACK.

02:33.233 --> 02:37.300
PERHAPS YOUR PARENTS
COULD USE A LITTLE
PEP TALK.

02:37.300 --> 02:40.000
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.400
WELL, THAT NO ONE
LIKES REJECTION,

02:42.400 --> 02:45.700
BUT IF YOU KEEP APPLYING
AND KEEP TRYING,

02:45.700 --> 02:50.400
YOU AND
THE RIGHT COLLEGE
WILL FIND EACH OTHER.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.133
THANKS, MR. FEENY.

02:52.133 --> 02:54.000
I MEAN, FROM MY PARENTS

02:54.000 --> 02:55.867
'CAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE SAID YET.

03:02.567 --> 03:04.400
CORY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:04.400 --> 03:07.100
I'M ENJOYING
A TASTY LEMON.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.734
IS THERE A REASON?

03:09.734 --> 03:11.800
YEAH. WE'RE OUT OF MINTS.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.400
SUCKING CITRUS, EH?

03:13.400 --> 03:14.967
CORY'S GOT A DATE.

03:14.967 --> 03:16.100
IT'S NOT A DATE.

03:16.100 --> 03:18.967
DAD SAYS
YOU'RE GOING ON A DATE.

03:18.967 --> 03:20.000
IT'S NOT A DATE!

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
DATE--THE BIGGEST.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.767
WHY CAN'T YOU GUYS
LEARN FROM MORGAN?

03:23.767 --> 03:25.200
SHE'S A GREAT SISTER.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.000
SHE STAYS IN HER ROOM,

03:27.000 --> 03:28.600
YOU DON'T HEAR FROM HER,

03:28.600 --> 03:31.133
AND SHE STAYS OUT
OF MY PERSONAL LIFE.

03:31.133 --> 03:35.600
SO, RUMOR UPSTAIRS IS
YOU GOT A DATE.

03:36.700 --> 03:40.100
MORGAN,
LONG TIME, NO SEE.

03:40.100 --> 03:46.100
YEAH. THAT WAS THE LONGEST
TIME-OUT I'VE EVER HAD.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.600
SO WHO'S
THE UNLUCKY GIRL?

03:47.600 --> 03:50.967
IF YOU MUST KNOW,
HER NAME IS MELISSA.

03:50.967 --> 03:52.300
WE'RE JUST SEEING A MOVIE.

03:52.300 --> 03:55.300
WITH THAT THING
ON YOUR NOSE?

03:56.600 --> 03:57.700
WHAT THING?

03:57.700 --> 03:59.867
IT'S TOO EASY!

04:02.400 --> 04:03.400
COME ON, MORGAN.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.600
LET'S GO WATCH TV
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

04:05.600 --> 04:09.033
TV's NOT FUNNY.
CORY'S LIFE IS FUNNY.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.100
COME ON, MORGAN.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.600
I JUST GOT HERE.
I HAVE TO LEAVE AGAIN?

04:14.600 --> 04:16.200
CORY HAS TO
TALK WITH ERIC.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.000
YEAH, SURE.
CORY TALKS TO ERIC.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.367
CORY TALKS TO SHAWN.

04:20.367 --> 04:22.300
CORY TALKS
TO MOM AND DAD.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.567
WHEN DOES CORY
TALK TO MORGAN?

04:24.567 --> 04:25.967
ARE YOU HERE NOW?

04:25.967 --> 04:26.967
YEAH.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.100
WERE YOU HERE BEFORE?

04:28.100 --> 04:33.133
NO. I WAS IN MY ROOM
FOR A REAL LONG TIME.

04:33.133 --> 04:35.133
BE HAPPY.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.233
YOUR FIRST DATE
AFTER A SERIOUS
RELATIONSHIP

04:39.233 --> 04:40.233
CAN BE TOUGH.

04:40.233 --> 04:41.834
IT'S NOT A DATE!
I KNOW.

04:41.834 --> 04:45.233
I RESPECT YOU FOR
GETTING BACK OUT THERE.

04:45.233 --> 04:46.300
THANKS, ERIC.

04:46.300 --> 04:47.500
ANY ADVICE?

04:47.500 --> 04:49.200
IT'S A WHOLE NEW WORLD,

04:49.200 --> 04:51.400
SO DON'T MENTION
YOUR OLD GIRLFRIEND.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.767
YOUR DATE'S
NOT INTERESTED.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.600
THIS IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.400
THIS COULD SAVE YOU
IF YOU GET IN TROUBLE.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.100
[MRS. MATTHEWS]
ERIC, JODIE'S
ON THE PHONE.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.100
GOTTA GO.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.200
ERIC, THAT LAST THING,
THE SAVING THING.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.667
IT WASN'T THAT IMPORTANT.
COMING, JODIE!

05:08.300 --> 05:10.800
THAT WAS
SUCH A GREAT MOVIE.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.900
HOW WAS THE ONE
YOU GUYS SAW?

05:13.900 --> 05:15.834
NICE,
BUT WE MISSED YOU.

05:15.834 --> 05:17.800
I WAS JUST
ONE THEATER OVER.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.800
THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF MULTIPLEXES.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.967
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'D TALK
DURING THE MOVIE
ANYWAY, RIGHT?

05:25.500 --> 05:28.233
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
WE COULD'VE DONE.

05:28.233 --> 05:31.233
COULD'VE, SHOULD'VE.
LET'S NOT LIVE
IN THE PAST.

05:31.233 --> 05:33.500
ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA KEEP TALKING?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.667
I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF
KISS.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.500
WHEW! FRESH AIR.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.900
EXCUSE US
FOR A MINUTE.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.300
KATIE?

05:43.667 --> 05:46.734
HI. I'M ON A DATE.
WHAT ARE YOU ON?

05:46.734 --> 05:47.734
A DATE.

05:47.734 --> 05:49.767
NO. YOU'RE ON
THE LECTURE CIRCUIT.

05:49.767 --> 05:52.500
A DATE ISN'T A DATE
UNTIL YOU KISS.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.734
THAT'S JUST
YOUR OPINION.

05:53.734 --> 05:56.900
IT'S THE REASON
WE GOT OUT OF THE TREES!

05:56.900 --> 05:59.000
I'M DOING THIS
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I DON'T WANT
TO PRESSURE YOU,

06:01.000 --> 06:02.900
BUT YOU'VE GOT
TO KISS HER.

06:02.900 --> 06:03.967
I KNOW.

06:03.967 --> 06:07.567
REMEMBER, YOU'VE GOT
UNTIL THE DOORSTEP.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.300
SO, HERE WE ARE
AT THE DOORSTEP.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.967
YOU SAID THAT
THREE TIMES ALREADY.

06:15.967 --> 06:18.300
I JUST CAN'T
GET OVER IT.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.667
A DOOR, A STEP--
A DOORSTEP.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.000
IT'S THE PERFECT WORD.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.400
SOME WORDS ARE SO BOGUS.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.734
"WINDOW."
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

06:27.734 --> 06:29.200
KISS ME.

06:29.200 --> 06:32.300
REALLY? JUST LIKE THAT?

06:32.300 --> 06:35.567
YEAH. DON'T YOU WANT TO?

06:38.300 --> 06:40.500
MR. TURNER, MR. WILLIAMS,
MR. FEENY!

06:40.500 --> 06:42.467
THEY SAID
IT COULDN'T BE DONE.

06:42.467 --> 06:44.033
THEY SAID
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

06:44.033 --> 06:45.500
THEY SAID
WE'RE EATING HERE.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.900
WRONG ON
ALL THREE COUNTS.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.567
YOU GONNA TELL US
OR TORMENT US?

06:48.567 --> 06:53.000
BOTH. I HOLD HERE A LETTER
OF ACCEPTANCE TO COLLEGE.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
WHOSE?
MINE.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
ALL RIGHT, MATTHEW!

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
OUTSTANDING!

06:56.000 --> 06:57.100
CONGRATULATIONS,
ERIC.

06:57.100 --> 07:00.233
YOUR PARENTS
MUST BE RELIEVED
AND VERY HAPPY.

07:00.233 --> 07:01.667
I SURE AM.

07:01.667 --> 07:03.300
SO WHERE YOU GOING?

07:03.300 --> 07:04.300
BORIS.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.300
BORIS?

07:05.300 --> 07:06.300
YUP. BORIS.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.700
BORIS COLLEGE?

07:07.700 --> 07:08.934
B.C.

07:08.934 --> 07:11.567
MR. MATTHEWS,
I'M NOT FAMILIAR
WITH ANY BORIS.

07:11.567 --> 07:13.100
MAY I SEE
YOUR LETTER?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.100
SURE. CAN YOU
WIPE YOUR HANDS FIRST?

07:15.100 --> 07:17.400
THIS IS GOING
ON THE REFRIGERATOR

07:17.400 --> 07:19.600
RIGHT UNDER
THE MAGNETIC SUSHI.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.033
WELL, ONCE AGAIN,
CONGRATULATIONS.

07:21.033 --> 07:26.000
I'M SURE BORIS COLLEGE
WILL BE VERY LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.300
THANK YOU, MR. FEENY.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.967
THANKS FOR
BELIEVING IN ME.

07:28.967 --> 07:30.400
WHEN BORIS
PLAYS NOTRE DAME,

07:30.400 --> 07:32.300
WE'LL BE SITTING
ON THE 50-YARD LINE.

07:32.300 --> 07:36.100
KRISTEN,
GUESS WHO GOT
INTO COLLEGE?

07:37.600 --> 07:38.600
BORIS?

07:38.600 --> 07:42.133
I'LL TAKE NOTRE DAME
BY 60 POINTS.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.734
HEY, HEY, HEY,
MI AMIGO.

07:44.734 --> 07:48.900
ALL YOU DID
WAS SHAKE HER HAND?

07:48.900 --> 07:50.000
HOW'D YOU
FIGURE THAT?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.500
IT'S WRITTEN ALL OVER
YOUR UNKISSED FACE.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.667
SHAWN, I WAS GOING
TO KISS HER.

07:55.667 --> 07:56.967
MY LIPS WERE PRIMED.

07:56.967 --> 07:59.300
MY HAND JUST
GOT THERE FIRST.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.967
YOU'LL NEVER
BE OVER TOPANGA

08:00.967 --> 08:02.300
UNTIL YOU KISS
ANOTHER GIRL.

08:02.300 --> 08:03.400
AND I WILL.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.200
O.K., BUT IT
WON'T BE MELISSA.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.300
AFTER LAST NIGHT,
SHE'LL NEVER
SEE YOU AGAIN.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.500
CORY, I'D LIKE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.500
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

08:11.500 --> 08:12.900
SOUNDS GREAT.

08:12.900 --> 08:16.200
ANY OTHER GUY
WOULD'VE KISSED ME,
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.734
I LIKE THAT.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.767
EVERYTHING
I'VE EVER BELIEVED
IS WRONG.

08:23.767 --> 08:28.967
I...I MUST TRY THIS,
WHAT YOU CALL HANDSHAKE.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.400
HI, SHAWN.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.367
HI, KATIE.

08:32.367 --> 08:34.200
CAN I, UH...

08:34.200 --> 08:36.467
CAN I SHAKE YOUR HAND?

08:36.467 --> 08:37.867
SURE.

08:42.300 --> 08:44.400
CORY, YOU'RE A GENIUS.

08:46.967 --> 08:49.600
NOW, TONIGHT,
THAT WAS A FLICK, HUH?

08:49.600 --> 08:53.367
IT WAS NICE BEING
IN THE SAME THEATER
WITH YOU.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.233
MAYBE NEXT TIME WE'LL
BE IN THE SAME ROW.

08:56.233 --> 08:57.400
I HAD TO MOVE.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.500
YOU CAN'T ASK A GUY
TO TAKE HIS TURBAN OFF.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.967
SO, BEING OUR
SECOND DATE AND ALL,

09:02.967 --> 09:09.800
SEEMS ONLY NATURAL
THAT WE SHOULD TAKE
THE NEXT STEP AND...

09:11.033 --> 09:12.767
MEET YOUR PARENTS.

09:13.834 --> 09:15.400
EVERYBODY DECENT?

09:23.300 --> 09:24.667
YOU MET HER PARENTS?

09:24.667 --> 09:26.700
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.867
HOW DO YOU
NOT KISS HER?

09:28.867 --> 09:31.467
I WAS GOING TO,
BUT WHEN I TRIED,

09:31.467 --> 09:34.133
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
WAS TOPANGA.

09:34.133 --> 09:36.300
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M NOT OVER HER.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.500
BUT SHE'S NOT OVER ME.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.834
I KNOW IT,
TOPANGA KNOWS IT, AND--

09:45.834 --> 09:49.200
THE GUY SHE'S KISSING
KNOWS IT.

09:56.767 --> 10:01.500
WHY DOESN'T TOPANGA
JUST RIP MY HEART OUT
AND STOMP ON IT?

10:01.500 --> 10:04.800
SHE CAN'T.
SHE'S BUSY MAKING OUT.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.834
MAYBE I'M DREAMING.

10:08.834 --> 10:10.800
PINCH ME.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.600
NOT ON THE BUTT.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.600
SORRY.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.967
IT'S JUST
RIGHT THERE.

10:16.967 --> 10:19.834
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
I'M GOING IN.

10:19.834 --> 10:24.400
CORY, I WON'T LET YOU
MAKE A FOOL OF YOURSELF.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.200
BUT THAT GUY'S
HELPING HIMSELF
TO MY WOMAN!

10:27.200 --> 10:29.400
1--SHE'S NOT
YOUR WOMAN,

10:29.400 --> 10:30.867
AND 2--

10:30.867 --> 10:32.233
WOW. HE'S FAST.

10:32.233 --> 10:34.133
I'M PUTTING A STOP
TO THIS.

10:34.133 --> 10:37.000
NO. THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE GOING HOME.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.100
WATCH YOUR FEET!
HOT SOUP!

10:39.100 --> 10:40.600
COMING THROUGH! O.K.!

10:40.600 --> 10:42.033
[CORY]
OW! OHH! OW!

10:42.033 --> 10:46.500
SORRY. IT'S NOT EASY
TO HOLD A GUY
AND WORK A LOCK.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.967
SHAWN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:47.967 --> 10:50.500
I'M GOING RIGHT BACK
TO TOPANGA.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.500
WHAT WILL YOU
TELL HER?

10:51.500 --> 10:54.934
IF SHE KEEPS
KISSING GUYS LIKE THAT,

10:54.934 --> 10:56.500
THEN...THEN...IT'S OVER.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.033
CORY, IT <i>IS </i>OVER!

10:58.033 --> 11:01.500
TOPANGA'S DOING EXACTLY
WHAT SHE'S SUPPOSED TO.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.667
SHE'S MET SOMEONE NEW,

11:02.667 --> 11:04.000
SHE'S DATING
SOMEONE NEW,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.033
AND NOW SHE'S
KISSING SOMEONE NEW,

11:06.033 --> 11:07.200
JUST LIKE YOU
WERE GONNA.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.734
BUT I DIDN'T, SHAWN.

11:08.734 --> 11:10.033
I DON'T WANT THIS.

11:10.033 --> 11:11.033
WELL, CORY--

11:11.033 --> 11:13.700
I DON'T WANT THIS,
SHAWN.

11:14.767 --> 11:16.700
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

11:16.700 --> 11:20.000
SOMETHING I SHOULD'VE DONE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.200
CORY.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.800
MELISSA,
I WASN'T MYSELF TONIGHT.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.100
LAST NIGHT,
WHO WAS THAT?

11:31.100 --> 11:33.367
BUT THERE ARE SPARKS
BETWEEN US,

11:33.367 --> 11:37.400
AND WE SHOULD SEE
WHAT WE GOT HERE.

11:44.900 --> 11:45.900
NOTHING.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.500
OH, WELL. SEE YOU.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.133
MY BEST TO YOUR FOLKS.

11:52.100 --> 11:55.200
AS SOON AS I
KISSED MELISSA,
I FELT WORSE.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.467
SO THERE ARE NO SPARKS.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.867
YOU DID A GOOD THING
KISSING ANOTHER GIRL.

11:58.867 --> 12:02.000
THIS WAY, WHEN YOU SEE
TOPANGA WITH ANOTHER GUY,

12:02.000 --> 12:03.867
YOU WON'T GO BONKERS.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.000
BONKERS!

12:08.100 --> 12:09.500
HEY! WHAT--

12:10.600 --> 12:13.467
CHICKEN FIGHTS.
ME AND NICK.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.734
NOW I'VE LOST HIM AGAIN.

12:16.800 --> 12:17.800
CORY, HI.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.967
SO, DO YOU KNOW
NICK?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.300
BETTER THAN BEFORE.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.400
SO YOU MUST BE
THE OLD BOYFRIEND, RIGHT?

12:26.400 --> 12:28.500
SO SHE'S TALKED
ABOUT ME, HUH?

12:28.500 --> 12:33.600
NO. THOSE ARE THE ONLY ONES
WHO JUMP ON MY BACK.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.900
SEE YA.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.200
CORY, I KNOW
THIS IS WEIRD FOR YOU,

12:38.200 --> 12:40.200
BUT YOU CAN'T BE
ACTING LIKE THIS.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.233
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER
ANYMORE.

12:41.233 --> 12:43.900
SO YOU CAN DATE
ANYONE YOU WANT TO?

12:43.900 --> 12:45.400
I WON'T HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.400
THEN I WILL.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.867
PEOPLE ARE
STARING AT US.

12:47.867 --> 12:52.600
LET THEM!
THAT DIDN'T BOTHER YOU
LAST NIGHT AT CHUBBIE'S.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.500
YOU WERE THERE?

12:55.500 --> 12:56.567
YEAH.

12:56.567 --> 13:00.734
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU THINK
THAT MADE ME FEEL?

13:00.734 --> 13:03.233
CORY, I'M SORRY
YOU SAW THAT,

13:03.233 --> 13:06.467
BUT WE BOTH KNEW WE
WOULD SEE OTHER PEOPLE.

13:06.467 --> 13:11.300
I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO KISS
ANYBODY ELSE.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.934
I WISH I KNEW
WHAT TO SAY.

13:13.934 --> 13:15.200
[BELL RINGS]

13:15.200 --> 13:17.300
I GOT TO
GET TO CLASS.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.500
I'M NOT DONE TALKING.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.500
I GOT TO GO.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.400
WHEN YOU WERE
MY GIRLFRIEND,

13:21.400 --> 13:23.300
YOU WOULD'VE BEEN
FIVE MINUTES LATE.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.834
WELL, I'M NOT YOUR
GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE.

13:25.834 --> 13:28.500
FINE.
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.967
LET'S NOT BE FRIENDS
ANYMORE, EITHER.

13:30.967 --> 13:32.800
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

13:37.934 --> 13:41.033
HEY, ERIC,
I HEARD YOUR GOOD NEWS.

13:41.033 --> 13:43.100
BORIS COLLEGE.
I'M PRETTY STOKED.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.100
MAYBE I SHOULD
APPLY THERE.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.133
WE COULD HANG OUT
TOGETHER.

13:47.133 --> 13:48.133
PARTY.

13:48.133 --> 13:51.033
I'M NOT SURE BORIS
IS A PARTY SCHOOL,

13:51.033 --> 13:53.200
BUT WE COULD
STUDY TOGETHER.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.867
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

13:55.867 --> 13:58.667
I CALLED THE NATIONAL
REGISTRY OF COLLEGES.

13:58.667 --> 13:59.667
AND?

13:59.667 --> 14:02.300
THEY NEVER HEARD
OF BORIS COLLEGE.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.600
I WAS HOPING
I WAS WRONG.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.233
GEORGE...BORIS?

14:07.233 --> 14:09.000
I SAID HOPING.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.467
I'VE HEARD OF THESE SCAMS.

14:10.467 --> 14:12.400
THEY TAKE $50
FROM UNSUSPECTING KIDS

14:12.400 --> 14:15.300
AND MAIL THEM A DIPLOMA
IN ANY FIELD.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.233
SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO TELL HIM.

14:17.233 --> 14:20.000
YEAH, I AGREE,
BUT WHO?

14:22.500 --> 14:24.233
OH, I KNOW.

14:24.233 --> 14:27.500
WHY DOESN'T
GEORGE DO IT?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.900
MR. MATTHEWS,
I NEED A WORD WITH YOU.

14:32.900 --> 14:36.133
IF IT'S ABOUT THAT
LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION,

14:36.133 --> 14:38.400
THANKS,
BUT I DON'T NEED IT.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.367
I'M BORIS-BOUND.

14:40.367 --> 14:41.600
I HAVE BAD NEWS.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.200
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BORIS COLLEGE

14:44.200 --> 14:45.367
BECAUSE, UH...

14:45.367 --> 14:48.033
WELL, BECAUSE
BORIS COLLEGE
DOESN'T EXIST.

14:48.033 --> 14:52.300
NOW, I KNOW THAT'S
VERY DISAPPOINTING
FOR YOU TO HEAR.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.300
I KIND OF ALREADY KNEW.

14:54.300 --> 14:55.500
YOU DO?

14:55.500 --> 14:59.767
A COUPLE OF DAYS
AFTER I GOT
MY ACCEPTANCE LETTER,

14:59.767 --> 15:01.900
THEY MAILED ME A DIPLOMA.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.000
I'M NO BRAIN SURGEON--

15:03.000 --> 15:06.133
ACTUALLY,
ACCORDING TO BORIS, I AM.

15:06.133 --> 15:07.400
IF YOU KNEW, ERIC,

15:07.400 --> 15:10.000
WHY DID YOU GO ON
PRETENDING?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.600
I DON'T KNOW,
MR. FEENY.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.400
EVERYBODY'S SITTING HERE
TALKING ABOUT COLLEGES,

15:14.400 --> 15:16.200
WHAT SCHOOLS
THEY'RE GOING TO,

15:16.200 --> 15:18.033
WHAT COURSES
THEY'LL BE TAKING.

15:18.033 --> 15:20.567
WHEN I GOT THAT
ACCEPTANCE LETTER,

15:20.567 --> 15:24.133
I FELT LIKE I WAS
PART OF SOMETHING.

15:24.133 --> 15:26.500
THAT'S WHAT IT'S
ALL ABOUT--LETTERS.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.900
THE WRONG LETTERS
ON MY REPORT CARD,

15:28.900 --> 15:30.600
THE WRONG LETTERS NOW.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.300
I'M VERY PLEASED
THAT GOING TO COLLEGE

15:33.300 --> 15:34.600
MEANS SO MUCH TO YOU.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.100
THAT SPIRIT
MAY GET YOU THERE.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.767
YEAH, I HOPE SO.

15:38.767 --> 15:41.467
BUT SERIOUSLY,
ERIC...

15:41.467 --> 15:42.667
BORIS COLLEGE?

15:42.667 --> 15:45.600
MR. FEENY,
YOU THINK THAT'S BAD?

15:45.600 --> 15:48.400
YOU SEE THAT GIRL
OVER THERE?

15:49.900 --> 15:53.233
SHE THINKS SHE'S GOING
TO SOME SCHOOL CALLED DUKE.

15:53.233 --> 15:56.767
YOU GONNA TELL HER
OR SHOULD I?

15:56.767 --> 15:58.133
DUKE!

16:02.600 --> 16:06.000
"TO CORY,
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, 1991.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.200
LOVE ALWAYS, TOPANGA"

16:08.200 --> 16:12.100
ALWAYS IS PRETTY SHORT
THESE DAYS.

16:13.567 --> 16:17.000
"JOHN ADAMS HIGH SCHOOL
PROM FASHION SHOW
THIS SATURDAY."

16:17.000 --> 16:19.133
LIKE THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

16:20.367 --> 16:23.233
<i>I LOVE YOU BEAR-RYMUCH. </i>

16:23.233 --> 16:27.133
YEAH? AND I
GOT A CRUSH ON YOU.

16:29.867 --> 16:35.000
<i>I LOVE YOU BEAR--AAH! </i>

16:37.467 --> 16:38.800
CORY, WHAT WAS THAT?

16:38.800 --> 16:43.900
<i>THAT </i>WAS THE SOUND OF
A RELATIONSHIP ENDING, DAD.

16:43.900 --> 16:47.100
CORY, DIDN'T TOPANGA
GIVE YOU THIS?

16:47.100 --> 16:48.133
YEP.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.667
I THOUGHT YOU TWO
AGREED TO STAY FRIENDS.

16:50.667 --> 16:53.300
SO DID I,
BUT TOPANGA
DIDN'T MEAN IT.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.400
TWO WEEKS
AFTER WE BREAK UP,

16:55.400 --> 16:56.867
SHE'S KISSING
ANOTHER GUY.

16:56.867 --> 16:59.367
AND NOT
JUST ANY GUY, DAD.

16:59.367 --> 17:00.967
<i>ANOTHER </i>GUY.

17:00.967 --> 17:03.100
I MEAN,
I DON'T WANT THIS.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.500
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU SHOULDN'T BE UPSET,

17:05.500 --> 17:08.800
BUT YOU KNOW
TOPANGA WILL GO OUT
WITH OTHER GUYS,

17:08.800 --> 17:12.200
AND YOU WILL GO OUT
WITH OTHER GIRLS.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.400
YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.800
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO DATE AROUND.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.800
THAT'S HOW YOU FIND
THE RIGHT PERSON.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.900
BUT WHAT IF TOPANGA'S
MY RIGHT PERSON?

17:20.900 --> 17:21.934
SHE MIGHT BE.

17:21.934 --> 17:23.300
GOING OUT
WITH OTHER GIRLS

17:23.300 --> 17:25.233
MIGHT HELP YOU
FIND OUT FOR SURE.

17:25.233 --> 17:29.233
YOUR MOM AND I BROKE UP,
GOT BACK TOGETHER

17:29.233 --> 17:30.367
THREE OR FOUR--

17:30.367 --> 17:31.400
ONCE!

17:31.400 --> 17:33.500
RIGHT! UH, ONCE...

17:33.500 --> 17:36.200
BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.500
DID YOU GUYS
STAY FRIENDS?

17:37.500 --> 17:39.200
THERE WERE
SOME ROCKY POINTS,

17:39.200 --> 17:41.667
BUT WE WERE ALWAYS THERE
FOR EACH OTHER.

17:41.667 --> 17:44.800
I THINK THAT'S
WHAT BROUGHT US
BACK TOGETHER.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.467
IF YOU REALLY CARE
FOR EACH OTHER,

17:46.467 --> 17:50.667
YOU DON'T THROW AWAY
THE MOST IMPORTANT
BOND YOU HAVE--

17:50.667 --> 17:52.734
YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

17:57.734 --> 18:00.867
WE GOT A ROOMFUL OF PARENTS
OUT THERE.

18:00.867 --> 18:03.400
I'LL NEED YOU LINED UP
AS COUPLES.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.467
TOPANGA,
I DON'T SEE MATTHEWS.

18:05.467 --> 18:06.834
I DON'T THINK YOU WILL.

18:06.834 --> 18:10.300
HEY, MATTHEWS
WOULDN'T LET YOU DOWN.

18:11.767 --> 18:13.834
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.500
HI, EVERYBODY.

18:17.500 --> 18:21.500
UH, WELCOME TO THE SECOND...
OR THIRD...

18:21.500 --> 18:24.834
OR WHATEVER ANNUAL
FASHION THING.

18:24.834 --> 18:27.867
UH, I'M HERE BECAUSE
MRS. BUCKLEY IS HOME

18:27.867 --> 18:30.600
HACKING UP
ALL KINDS OF GOOD STUFF.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.800
LUCKY HER.
HA HA HA!

18:32.800 --> 18:34.567
AHEM. SO HERE WE GO.

18:34.567 --> 18:36.767
IF YOU SEE ANYTHING
YOU LIKE,

18:36.767 --> 18:38.800
THERE'S ORDER FORMS
ON THE TABLE.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.367
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS,
DON'T ASK ME

18:41.367 --> 18:45.300
'CAUSE THIS IS
THE NICEST THING I OWN.

18:54.900 --> 18:55.967
CORY.

18:55.967 --> 18:57.967
UM, SORRY I'M LATE.

18:57.967 --> 18:59.300
COME ON. LET'S GO.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.500
CORY, WAIT.

19:01.500 --> 19:05.000
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO KNOW.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.800
THE OTHER DAY WHEN
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO BE FRIENDS,

19:08.800 --> 19:11.000
YOU REALLY HURT ME.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.834
AND I FELT GREAT
WHEN I SAW YOU
KISSING THAT GUY.

19:14.834 --> 19:17.133
NICK HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

19:17.133 --> 19:19.400
MUST YOU USE HIS NAME?

19:19.400 --> 19:22.600
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL HIM?

19:22.600 --> 19:23.600
SALLY.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.934
CALL HIM SALLY.

19:24.934 --> 19:26.500
CORY,
YOU'RE BEING CRAZY.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.767
NO, YOU'RE BEING CRAZY.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.000
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
OUR ENTIRE LIVES.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.967
IT TOOK US 14 YEARS
TO KISS THE WAY
YOU KISSED HIM.

19:33.967 --> 19:36.700
I DIDN'T KISS HIM
LIKE I KISSED YOU.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.100
OH, GREAT.
I'M DANCING NOW.

19:39.100 --> 19:43.033
CORY, NICK IS JUST A GUY
I'M GOING OUT WITH.

19:43.033 --> 19:47.367
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HIM
THE WAY I CARED ABOUT YOU.

19:47.367 --> 19:49.500
WE'RE ONLY SEEING
OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE...

19:49.500 --> 19:51.834
WHAT ELSE ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

19:51.834 --> 19:54.233
I'M SUPPOSED
TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE.

19:54.233 --> 19:57.900
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO WAIT TILL I DIE.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.767
CORY, IF IT'LL MAKE YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

20:01.767 --> 20:05.300
THE FIRST TIME I SEE YOU
KISSING SOMEONE ELSE,

20:05.300 --> 20:06.834
I'LL JUMP ON HER BACK.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.367
REALLY?

20:08.367 --> 20:09.600
PROBABLY NOT.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.000
BUT I'LL SURE
FEEL LIKE IT.
