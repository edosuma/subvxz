JUDY WANTS OUR HOUSE

00:14.515 --> 00:16.084
IF JUDY WANTS
TO SCARE PEOPLE,

00:16.150 --> 00:19.887
ALL SHE HAS TO DO
IS SHOW THEM HER ROOM.

00:19.953 --> 00:22.256
I DON'T WANT

00:59.293 --> 01:01.962

SHORTAGE OF...

01:02.029 --> 01:03.697

02:30.718 --> 02:33.954

BE SOME MAGIC CLUE *

02:34.021 --> 02:37.891
* INSIDE
THESE GENTLE WALLS *

02:37.958 --> 02:41.595

03:14.595 --> 03:18.766
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

03:29.443 --> 03:32.246
ALL THOSE PEOPLE...

03:32.313 --> 03:35.583
OH, LOOK,

03:40.521 --> 03:42.523
WELL, DID WE GET
GOOD OUTFITS?

03:42.590 --> 03:44.592

WHO AM I
GOING TO BE?

04:08.081 --> 04:09.950
THE HUNCHBACK

04:12.553 --> 04:14.355
HARRIETTE,
YOU'RE A POPULAR SIZE.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.723
IT WAS EITHER
THE HUNCHBACK

04:15.789 --> 04:17.925
OR LEATHER FACE.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.092
CALL ME CRAZY,

04:34.107 --> 04:36.209
YEAH, BUT
NOT SCARY ENOUGH.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.711
WE NEED SOMETHING ELSE,

04:37.778 --> 04:40.481

05:50.283 --> 05:52.185

06:58.519 --> 06:59.620
FOR MAKING ME
FEEL BETTER

06:59.687 --> 07:02.590

08:10.791 --> 08:12.660
SORRY. I'M
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.062
I'VE NEVER BEEN INVOLVED
IN A ROBBERY BEFORE,

08:15.128 --> 08:17.264
EXCEPT THE TIME
DAD GOT OUR WATER BILL.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.032
HE SAID,
"THIS IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY."

12:17.805 --> 12:19.106
SHUT UP.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.809
AND THAT GOES FOR YOU,
TOO, PATTI LaBELLE.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.878
TINA TURNER.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.617

12:30.683 --> 12:31.852
YEAH.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.489
IT'S FOR YOU.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.828
HELLO.
THIS IS OFFICER
CARL WINSLOW

12:40.894 --> 12:42.562
OF THE METRO
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

12:42.629 --> 12:43.897
WHO AM I SPEAKING TO?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.799
MARGARET THATCHER.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.237
LOOK, I GOT
FIVE PEOPLE HERE.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.872
YOU WANT THEM
TO STAY HEALTHY,

12:51.939 --> 12:53.974
YOU GIVE ME
EXACTLY WHAT I WANT.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.309
ALRIGHT. JUST STAY CALM
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.045
AND I'LL DO MY BEST
GETTING IT FOR YOU.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.246
REALLY?

13:00.580 --> 13:03.683
YEAH. MY ONLY CONCERN
IS THAT NOBODY GETS HURT.

13:03.750 --> 13:07.888
OKAY. GREAT.
HERE'S WHAT I WANT.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.858
GET ME A VAN,
GASSED UP,

13:10.924 --> 13:13.326
AND I WANT A PLANE
WAITING FOR ME
AT THE AIRPORT.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.895
WHERE YOU GOING?

13:14.962 --> 13:16.496
DISNEYLAND.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.567
I'LL TELL THE PILOT
WHEN I GET THERE.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.935
OKAY.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.504
I'LL GET ON THIS,
BUT IT'S GOING
TO TAKE TIME--

13:24.571 --> 13:26.039
THREE OR MAYBE
FOUR HOURS.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.508
REALLY?
WHY SO LONG?

13:28.575 --> 13:30.310
JUST STALLING, SIR.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.947
OH. GOOD. JUST LIKE
I TAUGHT YOU.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.683
LOOK, I'M NOT
A PHONE PERSON.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.219
I'M A GUN PERSON.
YOU GOT ONE HOUR.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.756
ALRIGHT. IF I'M GOING
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN,

13:43.823 --> 13:45.225
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO SOMEONE

13:45.292 --> 13:47.260
TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY
IN THERE IS OKAY.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.098
YOU, PAULA ABDUL.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.534
TI--FINE.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.139

IF YOU PEOPLE ARE OKAY.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.109
HELLO.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.077
LAURA?

14:04.144 --> 14:05.578
DADDY?

14:06.413 --> 14:08.315
OH MY GOD.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.050
SWEETHEART, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN THERE?

14:11.784 --> 14:12.920
WELL, WELL, WELL.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.888
ISN'T THIS INTERESTING?

14:14.955 --> 14:16.656
MY LUCK HAS CHANGED.

14:16.723 --> 14:19.092
I GOT ME
A COP'S DAUGHTER HERE.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.261
IF YOU WANT HER BACK
SAFE AND SOUND,

14:21.328 --> 14:23.964
YOU GET ME MY VAN,
AND FAST.

14:32.072 --> 14:37.077
LET'S SEE.
WE HAVE A PRETTY ANGEL
AND A FEROCIOUS PIRATE.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.451
ISN'T THAT CUTE?
THEY CLEANED YOU OUT.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.459
I SHOULD'VE POPPED
THAT BOZO.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.075
GOOD NEWS.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.143
I FOUND THREE
PEANUT BUTTER CUPS

15:10.210 --> 15:13.413
IN CARL'S SOCK DRAWER.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.249
MM-HMM. GOOD EATING.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.686
WE'RE BACK.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.021
HEY, LOOK, HUMPY.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.957
IT'S JANET JACKSON
AND RAPHAEL.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.792
DID YOU KIDS HAVE FUN?

15:25.858 --> 15:26.826
YEAH.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.162
IT WAS GREAT, DUDES.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.300
LOOK AT ALL
THE CANDY--

15:33.366 --> 15:34.167
WAIT A MINUTE.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.436
MY BAG'S
ALMOST EMPTY.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.108
HOW COME
YOURS IS FULL?

15:41.174 --> 15:43.410
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS I'M JUST CUTER.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.379
COME BACK HERE, YOU.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.750
RACHEL, NOW THAT THE KIDS
ARE ON A SUGAR HIGH,

15:50.817 --> 15:52.752
SEE IF YOU CAN GET 'EM
TO SELL US THEIR CANDY.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.754
BUT I THOUGHT LAURA AND STEVE
WENT OUT TO GET SOME.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.089
THEY NEVER CAME BACK.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.890
PROBABLY OUT
GOOFING AROUND.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.492
WELL, IT'S HALLOWEEN.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.694
BY THE WAY, HARRIETTE, I'M
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

16:01.761 --> 16:02.929
WHY?

16:02.996 --> 16:05.432
I THOUGHT YOU'D
AT LEAST TRY ON THE HUMP.

16:17.610 --> 16:21.148
YOU LISTEN TO ME.
I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.415
THESE HOSTAGES
ARE HISTORY

16:22.482 --> 16:25.018
IF YOU DON'T DELIVER
IN FIVE MINUTES.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.519
THAT'S BETTER.

16:27.687 --> 16:31.058
THE PIZZAS WILL BE HERE
IN FIVE MINUTES.

16:31.124 --> 16:35.828
IN ANOTHER 10 MINUTES,
WE'LL GET THEM FOR FREE.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.130
SHUT UP.

16:44.571 --> 16:45.738
LAURA.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.310
WHAT?

16:50.377 --> 16:53.012
I THINK I CAN
TAKE THIS GUY.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.485
ARE YOU NUTS?

16:58.551 --> 16:59.319
I DON'T CARE.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.721
I'VE BEEN
PUSHED TOO FAR.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.125
WHY, HE'S
THREATENED US,

17:05.192 --> 17:06.559
RIDICULED US,

17:06.626 --> 17:11.164
AND HE WOULDN'T
LET US GET ANCHOVIES
ON OUR PIZZAS.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.400
A GUY CAN ONLY
TAKE SO MUCH.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.769
STEVE,
HE'S GOT A GUN.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.506
HE'LL SHOOT YOU
AND YOU'LL DIE.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.474
GO FOR IT, STEVE.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.364
HYAH!

17:44.431 --> 17:46.933
KID, YOU JUST MADE
A BIG MISTAKE.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.702
NOT AS BIG AS THE ONE
YOUR PARENTS MADE.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.573
WAH-WAH-WAH-WAH!

17:59.446 --> 18:01.581
WAH!

18:21.100 --> 18:23.336
OH, STEVE,
YOU WERE WONDERFUL.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.139
YES, I WAS,
WASN'T I?

18:26.206 --> 18:28.341
MY HERO.

18:44.023 --> 18:46.526
LAURA.

18:46.593 --> 18:47.860
WHAT?

18:47.927 --> 18:51.998
I THINK I CAN
TAKE THIS GUY.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.733
WHERE,
TO A MOVIE?

18:56.836 --> 19:00.573
WELL, I HAVE
TO TRY SOMETHING
TO SAVE YOU.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.087
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.657
OH, N-N-NOTHING.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.629
A-A-ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.598
SIT BACK DOWN
NEXT TO CHAKA KHAN.

19:29.569 --> 19:32.739
WELL, FINALLY
THE PIZZA'S HERE.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.542
COME ON. LET'S GO.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.748
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

19:41.814 --> 19:45.285
SORRY, MON.
CAUGHT A FLAT
ON ME BIKE.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.288
EH, DAT A REAL GUN?

19:48.355 --> 19:50.523
YEAH. AND THAT BETTER
BE REAL PIZZA.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.525
OH, IT IS, MON.
BEST IN TOWN.

19:52.592 --> 19:55.262
CHEESE FRESH.
22 DOLLAR, MON.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.030
THE COPS ARE PAYING.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.567
SHOOT.
THAT MEAN NO TIP.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.572
YOU OPEN IT.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.644
SEE. JUST GREASE.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.580
WHOA!

20:18.751 --> 20:19.552
EVERYBODY OKAY?

20:19.619 --> 20:21.053
YOU ALRIGHT,
SWEETHEART?

20:21.120 --> 20:23.356
OH, GOD
BLESS YOU.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.832
YOU GET
SOME TOMATO SOUP.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.901
AND YOU,

20:34.967 --> 20:36.736
PORK AND BEANS.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.510
MOM, YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE
WHAT HAPPENED TO US.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.811
YOUNG LADY,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

20:44.877 --> 20:46.379
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE BACK HERE

20:46.446 --> 20:48.281
WITH MORE CANDY
MORE THAN THREE HOURS AGO.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.117
WE WERE FORCED
TO HAND OUT
CANNED GOODS

20:51.183 --> 20:52.685
AND PORK PRODUCTS.

20:52.752 --> 20:56.289
I WANT TO KNOW
WHERE YOU WERE
AND WHAT HAPPENED.

20:56.356 --> 20:59.392
CARL, CAN I
TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

20:59.459 --> 21:01.694
WHAT'S
ON YOUR MIND, STEVE?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.763
WELL, I...

21:03.830 --> 21:04.797
I JUST...

21:04.864 --> 21:07.300
STEVE, WHAT'S WRONG?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.570
I'M A COWARD.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.839
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

21:12.905 --> 21:16.409
WELL, I PICTURED MYSELF
OVERPOWERING THAT ROBBER

21:16.476 --> 21:18.445
AND SAVING THE DAY,

21:18.511 --> 21:20.513
BUT I CHICKENED OUT.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.483
I JUST DID EVERYTHING
HE TOLD ME TO DO.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.518
WELL, STEVE, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SHOULD'VE DONE.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.087
NO, NO. LAURA
WAS IN DANGER.

21:28.154 --> 21:31.090
I MEAN, I SHOULD'VE
DONE SOMETHING.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.426
STEVE,
THAT MAN WAS ARMED.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.827
IF YOU HAD
MADE A MOVE,

21:34.894 --> 21:37.464
YOU AND LAURA
MIGHT'VE GOTTEN HURT.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.165
BUT YOU MADE A MOVE.

21:39.231 --> 21:41.968
YOU WALTZED IN THERE
WITH THAT SILLY WIG

21:42.034 --> 21:44.303
AND BAD ACCENT
AND...

21:47.206 --> 21:50.710
YOU WERE
A REAL HERO, CARL.

21:50.777 --> 21:51.778
STEVE...

21:52.645 --> 21:54.647
CAN YOU
KEEP A SECRET?

21:54.714 --> 21:56.115
SURE.

21:56.182 --> 21:58.418
I WAS REAL SCARED, TOO.

21:58.485 --> 22:01.120
OH, REALLY?
YOU DIDN'T SHOW IT.

22:01.187 --> 22:02.355
ONLY BECAUSE

22:02.422 --> 22:06.359
I'VE BEEN TRAINED
FOR THOSE SITUATIONS.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.494
BUT REMEMBER,

22:07.560 --> 22:09.362
I USED
YOUR TRICK SNAKES.

22:09.429 --> 22:10.763
WELL, YEAH,

22:10.830 --> 22:12.031
THAT'S RIGHT.

22:13.265 --> 22:14.367
YOU KNOW, STEVE,

22:14.434 --> 22:16.335
YOU STUCK
BY MY DAUGHTER.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.337
YOU MADE SURE
THAT SHE WAS OKAY.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.440
YOU DID YOUR VERY BEST
TO DO THAT

22:20.507 --> 22:24.777
AND IN MY BOOK
THAT MAKES YOU A HERO.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.546
THANKS, MON.
