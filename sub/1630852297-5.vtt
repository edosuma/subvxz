28:58.480 --> 29:01.360
― Still hungry.
― It is the condition of men to be hungry.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.080
Not kings! Not emperors!

29:04.200 --> 29:06.120
You're learning fast.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

29:06.240 --> 29:09.440
― Why my not a king?
― I don't know.

29:09.560 --> 29:12.960
― Perhaps you are.
― Yes! A king! Is my name?

29:13.080 --> 29:15.080
― I don't know.
― King what?

29:15.200 --> 29:18.880
― You've never told me your name.
― Never heard. Not know.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.080
You're are a poor lost thing.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.120
(MIMICS) Lost thing.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.480
But I have taught you how to speak,
how to read!

29:27.600 --> 29:30.360
There is hope.
Who knows what you may accomplish?

29:33.400 --> 29:34.960
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

29:35.080 --> 29:37.320
― They hate me.
― Who does?

29:37.440 --> 29:39.440
Men. Women. Childs. Dogs.

29:39.560 --> 29:43.440
― No, they don't.
― They throw stones, beat me. Everywhere!

29:43.560 --> 29:47.240
Peasants are ignorant people.
They do not read, like you and I.

29:47.360 --> 29:51.040
It's an instinct to protect the home,
the family.

29:51.160 --> 29:56.160
― Perhaps they are frightened of you.
― My look bad.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.040
Not like Agatha.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.240
― Agatha?
― Beautiful wife!

30:01.360 --> 30:06.560
Well, Agatha is beautiful, certainly,
and Felix is kind.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.880
― Let me introduce you to them.
― No. They hate me.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.200
No, they don't, they've never met you!
Stay and greet them as they come home.

30:14.320 --> 30:18.480
Snow! Snow! Snow!

30:18.600 --> 30:20.440
FELIX: Agatha!

30:22.040 --> 30:25.600
― Agatha! Look what I found!
― And me, look what I found!

30:25.720 --> 30:29.200
It's all chopped, ready for the fire.
Just lying there at the top of the field.

30:29.320 --> 30:32.000
These were left by the stove.
The hare's already gutted.

30:32.120 --> 30:34.040
― Not a mark on the birds.
― How were they caught, then?

30:34.160 --> 30:36.920
It's a mystery. Who's doing this, Felix?

30:37.040 --> 30:39.800
― Somebody wants to help us...
― But who?

30:39.920 --> 30:42.920
Who would do that?
We're strangers here.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.240
Faerie folk.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.960
Faerie folk?

30:53.200 --> 30:55.280
Little people.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.800
You know, elves and sprites!

30:57.920 --> 30:59.840
Come here! Ssh!

31:06.200 --> 31:07.800

31:12.400 --> 31:16.760
― Are you there?
― Is anybody watching?

31:18.880 --> 31:21.080
Come out if you are!

31:21.200 --> 31:22.760
We'd...um...

31:22.880 --> 31:25.000
We'd like to thank you!

31:26.240 --> 31:27.680
Please?

31:28.760 --> 31:30.800
Please come out.

31:32.600 --> 31:36.240
― They won't come out.
― There's nobody there, you fool!

31:36.360 --> 31:38.440
It's just us.

31:38.560 --> 31:41.000
You see, we stick together
through thick and thin

31:41.120 --> 31:43.560
and never stop loving each other.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.720
And magical things happen.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.680
Father! Father!

31:58.120 --> 32:00.720
OLD MAN: The evenings grow warmer.

32:00.840 --> 32:04.680
Soon it will be spring.
There's a cheery thought!

32:04.800 --> 32:08.680
― Why?
― Well, spring, you know!

32:08.800 --> 32:10.800
"Ha, ha, ha!"
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

32:10.920 --> 32:12.920
Spring makes you happy? Why?

32:13.040 --> 32:17.520
― Well, we're still alive!
― How long are we meant to be alive for?

32:17.640 --> 32:22.080
― Let's turn for home. It's getting dark.
― How can you tell? You have no eyes.

32:24.160 --> 32:26.720

32:26.840 --> 32:30.760
It's a nightingale.
That means it's getting dark.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.640
The bird makes the dark?
That's impossible!

32:33.760 --> 32:37.520

― There. There it is.

33:15.440 --> 33:16.840
Describe it to me.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.640
― Solitary.
― That's a good word. Good.

33:20.760 --> 33:23.280
― And sad, like me.
― Why is it sad?

33:23.400 --> 33:26.120
― Because it is solitary.
― Why are you sad?

33:26.240 --> 33:28.520
Because with all that I read,
all that I learn,

33:28.640 --> 33:31.080
I discover how much I do not know.

33:31.200 --> 33:35.720
Ideas batter me like hailstones.
Questions but no answers.

33:35.840 --> 33:38.760
Who am I? Where am I from?
Do I have a family?

33:38.880 --> 33:42.920
You have us. My son will not
turn you away, I promise you.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.120
― Come along and say hello to him.
― No!

33:45.240 --> 33:47.880
― Why not? It's a simple request.
― Do not request it again!

33:52.720 --> 33:56.640
I have been reading
Plutarch, "The Lives of the Emperors".

33:56.760 --> 33:58.920
Ah, yes, the founders of ancient Rome,

33:59.040 --> 34:01.560
men who showed that the world
could be improved!

34:01.680 --> 34:04.360
Why do men live in herds in cities?

34:04.480 --> 34:07.920
I cannot imagine a city.
I cannot imagine Rome.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.960
The numbers are too great.

34:10.080 --> 34:13.400
We band together to help one another
and do good.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.520
But then you massacre each other.

34:15.639 --> 34:19.600
― Yes. It's inconsistent.
― I do not like inconsistence!

34:19.719 --> 34:22.280
― Why must it be so?
― I don't know. That's the way it is.

34:22.400 --> 34:26.080
― How do I find out the way that it is?
― I don't know. As you get older...

34:26.199 --> 34:30.840
Oh, De Lacey! All the time you say
you do not know, but you do know!

34:30.960 --> 34:33.360
Why do you grasp everything,
and I nothing?

34:33.480 --> 34:37.800
Why must I learn it all,
and it flies to you on the wind?

34:39.199 --> 34:41.639
I am the one who stands outside the door.

34:41.760 --> 34:44.960

34:45.080 --> 34:49.520
― What is it exactly that frightens you?
― Everything! Everything!

34:49.639 --> 34:53.719
Why do you live in a hut in the woods?
Why not a great city?

34:53.840 --> 34:55.639
― Because I am poor.
― Why?

34:55.760 --> 34:58.880
Because an army came by
and ransacked my university.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.400
― We were driven from the town.
― Am I poor?

35:01.520 --> 35:03.000
Yes.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.480
One day, though, you will find someone

35:05.600 --> 35:08.600
who will make you the wealthiest man
in creation.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.840
― Will I?
― Yes!

35:10.960 --> 35:13.000
A good man deserves it.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.080
You are a good man.

But you have a memory,

Someone! Her arms were long

― It was a good dream?
― It was pleasing! Is that good?

39:01.400 --> 39:03.840

it was morally good.

― Have you heard of him?
― That's my name!

44:47.000 --> 44:49.240
You? You're Frankenstein?

44:50.440 --> 44:53.560
(SCREAMS) You're ugly!
Leave me alone!

44:54.720 --> 44:59.320
― Victor Frankenstein? He is your father?
― No! Victor's my brother.

44:59.440 --> 45:02.560
― Where is he?
― He's at home. He's always at home.

45:02.680 --> 45:05.400
― Can I see him?
― No, of course you can't!

45:05.520 --> 45:08.280
(WILLIAM SPLUTTERS)
We must be friends, William.

45:08.400 --> 45:12.680
We'll climb those mountains, right to
the top, after you've taken me to Victor.

45:12.800 --> 45:16.400
― No! You're revolting!
― What is he? What does he do?

45:16.520 --> 45:20.720
― He's a scholar, a genius!
― Was he ever in Ingolstadt?

45:20.840 --> 45:24.600
Yes, he studied there.
He's come home to marry Elizabeth.

45:24.720 --> 45:29.240
But he's silly, he never leaves his room.
He's missing everything!

45:30.560 --> 45:34.320
― You will bring him to me. Come.
― No, I shan't!

45:34.440 --> 45:37.800
(SCREAMS) My father's a magistrate!
He'll punish you for this!

45:37.920 --> 45:40.800
― You'll go to prison! Help!
― Quiet, boy!

45:40.920 --> 45:45.720
VOICES CALLING: William!
William! William!

45:47.240 --> 45:50.640
MAN: This is where you were playing?
WOMAN: Yes, we were hiding.

45:50.760 --> 45:53.480
― He was coming to find us.
― Where were you hiding?

45:53.600 --> 45:56.040
― Down at the boat-house.
― You didn't see anything?

45:56.160 --> 45:58.320
― No, nothing.
― Heard nothing?

45:58.440 --> 46:02.000
He was calling out.
I thought it was part of the game!

46:02.120 --> 46:04.760
William! William!

46:04.880 --> 46:07.400
Divide into teams!
You, you, come with me!

46:07.520 --> 46:10.000
They are looking,
everyone is looking, you may go home.

46:10.120 --> 46:12.440
― William's missing! How long has it been?
― Since this afternoon.

46:12.560 --> 46:15.360
― But you may go home.
― I have a duty to help, Father.

46:15.480 --> 46:18.800
Victor, it doesn't help anybody
when you become agitated.

46:18.920 --> 46:21.160
He's my brother!
You let me join the search! I must!

46:21.280 --> 46:24.240
SERVANT: Monsieur Frankenstein,
look at this!

46:24.360 --> 46:27.960
― It's William's hat.
― What was he doing here?

46:28.080 --> 46:31.880
― We were playing hide-and-seek.
― And you didn't keep him in view?

46:32.000 --> 46:34.440
I was hiding from him.
How could I keep him in view?

46:34.560 --> 46:37.040
― But where were you?
― Well, where were you?

46:37.160 --> 46:39.160
Locked in your study, I suppose?

46:39.280 --> 46:41.280
William wasn't my responsibility.
He was yours!

46:41.400 --> 46:43.840
You have responsibility
for what, exactly?

46:43.960 --> 46:47.680
Enough!
The villagers are saying... Clarice?

46:49.160 --> 46:52.440
They say they've seen a beast
in the mountains, sir.

46:52.560 --> 46:56.040
VICTOR: A beast? What kind of a beast?
SERVANT: A monster. Tall as a pine tree!

46:56.160 --> 47:00.120
― They say it breathes blue fire!
― And they think this thing took William?

47:00.240 --> 47:04.400
― Someone took him! He can't be found.
― No one knows what's up those mountains.

47:04.520 --> 47:07.560
CLARICE: I know what's up those mountains.
Snow and ice.

47:07.680 --> 47:10.320
And a bit more snow and ice. That's all!

47:10.440 --> 47:13.760
Spread out and keep looking!
He may be nearby.

47:13.880 --> 47:16.240
SERVANTS: William! William! Willy!

47:17.360 --> 47:19.560
What do they mean, a monster?

47:19.680 --> 47:22.200
They've seen some sort of animal,
presumably.

47:22.320 --> 47:26.720
They didn't say an animal.
They said a monster, a creature.

47:26.840 --> 47:29.000
― Folk tales!
― Who exactly saw it?

47:29.120 --> 47:31.320
I don't know! Does it matter?

47:31.440 --> 47:34.800
Victor, you don't look well.

47:34.920 --> 47:38.800
I haven't seen you for weeks.
You're always up in your room.

47:38.920 --> 47:42.840
― Why do you need to see me?
― We're supposed to be getting married!

47:44.040 --> 47:46.400
Oh.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

47:46.520 --> 47:50.880
― So I'm supposed to...
― Talk to me occasionally, yes!

47:51.960 --> 47:55.120
What if I haven't got anything to say?
What am I meant to do then?

47:55.240 --> 47:58.120
SERVANTS: Monsieur! Come and see!
On the lake!

47:59.520 --> 48:01.400
― What is it?
― An open boat!

48:01.520 --> 48:03.560
― It's drifting against the current!
― That's impossible!

48:03.680 --> 48:05.680
― Against the wind!
― Is someone pulling it?

48:05.800 --> 48:08.600
― No!
― Is there anybody aboard? Haul it in!

48:08.720 --> 48:11.000
― Quickly.
― Careful.

48:12.280 --> 48:15.440
― William?
― CLARICE: Is it the child?

48:15.560 --> 48:18.120
ELIZABETH: Oh, please, no!

48:22.800 --> 48:25.560
VICTOR: He is dead, Father.

48:28.400 --> 48:33.600
M. FRANKENSTEIN: Is it him?
CLARICE: Angels in heaven! Little William!

48:33.720 --> 48:36.040
Have mercy on his soul!

48:36.160 --> 48:39.800
M. FRANKENSTEIN: My boy.
Let me see him.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.680
Carry him.

48:54.800 --> 48:57.360
Sound the bell.

48:57.480 --> 49:00.000
My son is dead.

49:13.160 --> 49:15.320
What are those papers?

49:20.560 --> 49:24.040
Victor, it looks like your hand.

49:24.160 --> 49:28.800
These are diagrams, equations. University
work! What are they doing here?

49:28.920 --> 49:31.400
― It seems they're pages from my journal.
― Where is your journal?

49:31.520 --> 49:33.400
I don't know. I lost it.

49:36.520 --> 49:39.760
― I don't know where it is!
― Victor!

49:39.880 --> 49:42.280
(BELL TOLLS)

49:47.560 --> 49:51.120
(♪ LABORIOUS POUNDING)

50:19.200 --> 50:21.360
Are you here?

50:21.480 --> 50:23.440
(WIND HOWLS)

50:23.560 --> 50:26.280
Where are you?

50:26.400 --> 50:28.440
Are you here?

50:29.680 --> 50:32.200
Where are you?

50:32.320 --> 50:35.360
Show yourself, you monstrous thing!

50:50.720 --> 50:52.640
My God!

50:54.440 --> 50:58.200
Muscular co-ordination ― hand and eye.
Perfect balance!

51:03.080 --> 51:05.560
Excellent tissue! The sutures have held!

51:07.240 --> 51:13.240
Well, I failed to make it handsome,
but I gave it strength and grace.

51:13.360 --> 51:15.680
What an achievement!

51:16.840 --> 51:19.840
Unsurpassed in scientific endeavour!

51:20.960 --> 51:23.520
Oh, God, the madness of that night!

51:23.640 --> 51:28.960
The heat, the sweat, the infusions!
The moment I saw it crawl towards me, I...

51:29.080 --> 51:31.280
You ran away.

51:32.120 --> 51:34.520
― What?
― You...abandoned me.

51:34.640 --> 51:37.080
― It speaks!
― Yes, Frankenstein.

51:37.200 --> 51:41.000
― It speaks!
― You know my name?

51:46.520 --> 51:49.280
― My journal!
― Why did you abandon me?

51:49.400 --> 51:54.040
― I was terrified. What had I done?
― Built a man and given him life!

51:55.200 --> 51:58.120
― Well, now I have come to take it away.
― Have you?

51:58.240 --> 52:02.640
― I have come to kill you!
― To kill me? Then why did you create me?

52:02.760 --> 52:05.520
― To prove that I could.
― You make sport with my life?

52:05.640 --> 52:08.000
In the cause of science!

52:10.720 --> 52:15.040
You were my greatest experiment,
but an experiment that has gone wrong.

52:15.160 --> 52:18.800
An experiment that must be curtailed!

52:27.280 --> 52:29.160
Be still, genius!

52:29.280 --> 52:31.840
― I have a request.
― Damn you, you can't have requests!

52:31.960 --> 52:34.680
Oh, I can!
Listen to me, it is your duty!

52:34.800 --> 52:38.360
― I've no duty to a murderer!
― If I am a murderer, you made me one!

52:38.480 --> 52:41.000
You killed my brother! You did it, not me!

52:43.600 --> 52:48.200
I curse the day that you drew breath.
Since then, I have lived in darkness.

52:48.320 --> 52:51.040
"Is this the Region,
this the Soil, the Clime,

52:51.160 --> 52:53.240
"Said then the lost Archangel.

52:53.360 --> 52:55.960
"This the seat
that we must change for Heav'n,

52:56.080 --> 52:59.840
"This mournful gloom
for that celestial light?"

53:02.760 --> 53:05.200
That's "Paradise Lost"!

53:06.600 --> 53:08.920
You've read "Paradise Lost"?

53:09.040 --> 53:10.960
I liked it.

53:11.080 --> 53:12.560
(LAUGHTER)

53:12.680 --> 53:15.320
Why? You saw yourself as Adam?

53:15.440 --> 53:18.960
I should be Adam,
God was proud of Adam,

53:19.080 --> 53:21.560
but Satan's the one I sympathise with.

53:21.680 --> 53:25.640
For I was cast out, like Satan,
though I did no wrong.

53:26.640 --> 53:31.080
And when I see others content,
I feel the bile rise in my throat,

53:31.200 --> 53:33.640
and it tastes like Satan's bile!

53:33.760 --> 53:37.440
This is remarkable!
You are educated and you have memory!

53:37.560 --> 53:41.200
Yes, I use it to remember
being hunted like a rat,

53:41.320 --> 53:44.760
running from human places,
finding refuge in the woods.

53:44.880 --> 53:48.040
I use it to remember being beaten
and whipped.

53:49.360 --> 53:53.560
― And I was good. I wanted to be good!
― Then why did you kill William?

53:53.680 --> 53:57.120
I wished to see you, and you came.
Would you have come otherwise?

53:57.240 --> 54:00.520
If I had killed half of Ingolstadt,
would you have come?

54:05.800 --> 54:08.560
Did no one show you kindness?

54:08.680 --> 54:12.520
There was an old man,
he taught me many things.

54:12.640 --> 54:17.360
But he was blind, he never saw my face,
he never knew I looked like this!

54:18.600 --> 54:22.040
After a year, after he'd described to me
the seasons,

54:22.160 --> 54:25.040
and I'd watched them
go round ― one-two-three-four ―

54:25.160 --> 54:28.360
when I was one year old,
he said they'd take me in,

54:28.480 --> 54:32.560
― the son and his wife, beautiful wife.
― What happened?

54:35.240 --> 54:39.120
― You know what happened.
― Oh, God, I do!

54:39.240 --> 54:41.360
I burned them in a fire.

54:42.880 --> 54:46.160
― I... I am sorry, I...
― Sorry? You're sorry?

54:46.280 --> 54:48.160
You caused this!

54:48.280 --> 54:51.640
This is your universe, Frankenstein!

54:51.760 --> 54:54.440
Here is my request.

54:57.200 --> 55:02.440
I wish to be a part of society, but no
human being will associate with me.

55:02.560 --> 55:07.040
But one of my own kind,
one just as deformed and horrible,

55:07.160 --> 55:10.320
― she would understand, she would...
― I'm sorry, what...?

55:10.440 --> 55:12.920
I want a female built like me.

55:14.880 --> 55:17.480
― A female?
― You made me like this.

55:17.600 --> 55:19.280
You alone have the power to...

55:19.400 --> 55:22.320
To create another brute,
another monster?

55:22.440 --> 55:25.080
― No, I will not.
― It is my right!

55:25.200 --> 55:28.200
You have no rights! You are a slave!

55:28.320 --> 55:32.360
You want me to build you a female,
so the pair of you can be wicked together.

55:32.480 --> 55:36.440
No, I will not! Torture me
as much as you like, I will never consent!

55:36.560 --> 55:40.120
I will not torture you. I will
reason with you. Isn't that what we do?

55:40.240 --> 55:42.440
Have a dialogue?

55:42.560 --> 55:44.120
(LAUGHTER)

55:44.240 --> 55:48.080
There is no dialogue with strangers,
with murderers!

55:49.200 --> 55:53.000
Yet you'd murder me if you could!
Why, you have just tried!

55:53.120 --> 55:55.840
So, why is your killing justified
and mine is not?

55:55.960 --> 56:00.160
Because... I won't argue with you! My God!
I'm up a mountain, debating with a...

56:00.280 --> 56:02.160
― A living creature!
― A nothing!

56:03.920 --> 56:06.360
A filthy mass of nothing!

56:07.840 --> 56:10.600
I am your master.
You should show respect!

56:10.720 --> 56:14.800
A master has duties.
You left me to die!

56:17.280 --> 56:22.040
I am not a slave. I am free!

56:22.160 --> 56:23.840
Ha!

56:25.240 --> 56:29.920
If you deny my request
I will make you my enemy.

56:31.240 --> 56:34.000
I will work at your destruction.

56:34.120 --> 56:36.160
I will dedicate myself.

56:36.280 --> 56:41.680
I will not rest
until I desolate your heart!

56:49.640 --> 56:51.200
I apologise.

56:52.440 --> 56:56.520
I did intend to reason.
I am capable of logic.

56:58.720 --> 57:02.200
I do not think what I ask is immoderate.

57:03.240 --> 57:07.120
A creature of another sex,
but just as hideous as I am.

57:07.240 --> 57:10.440
If you consent, we'll disappear for ever.

57:11.960 --> 57:15.240
We'll go to the wilds of South America

57:15.360 --> 57:19.560
and build our little paradise there
and live there in peace.

57:19.680 --> 57:22.640
And no human being will see us again.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.520
What do you say?

57:30.040 --> 57:32.520
I am amazed!

57:32.640 --> 57:36.640
― You have learnt so much, so fast!
― Are you proud of me?

57:36.760 --> 57:38.840
― Proud? No.
― Why not?

57:38.960 --> 57:41.880
― Your logic is flawed.
― Is it?

57:43.280 --> 57:45.280
You say you wish to go abroad
and live in exile

57:45.400 --> 57:49.240
yet you also say
you yearn to be accepted by society.

57:50.600 --> 57:52.360
Won't you grow tired of exile?

57:52.480 --> 57:55.080
Won't you return
and try again to live among people,

57:55.200 --> 57:59.720
only to meet with their detestation ―
because that is what you will meet with?

57:59.840 --> 58:04.680
Only now, when you run wild, there will be
two of you and double the destruction.

58:04.800 --> 58:08.640
― Why should I facilitate this?
― Because I am lonely!

58:10.840 --> 58:12.840
Every creature has a mate.

58:12.960 --> 58:16.880
Every bird in the sky!
Even you are to be married!

58:17.680 --> 58:20.560
Why am I denied the comforts
you allow yourself?

58:20.680 --> 58:23.960
A moment ago
you were amazed at my intellect,

58:24.080 --> 58:26.320
but now you harden your heart.

58:26.440 --> 58:30.760
Please, do not be inconsistent.
I find it infuriating.

58:30.880 --> 58:32.360
(LAUGHTER)

58:33.720 --> 58:38.600
All I ask is the possibility of love.

58:38.720 --> 58:40.720
― Love?
― Yes.

58:41.800 --> 58:45.560
― You think it is a possibility for you?
― Yes! A good man deserves it.

58:45.680 --> 58:48.960
― Are you a good man?
― I would be! Oh, I would be!

58:52.640 --> 58:55.320
I regret that you are lonely.
I did not foresee...

58:55.440 --> 58:58.600
― That I might have feelings?
― You were an equation, a theorem.

58:58.720 --> 59:00.480
I confess it!

59:01.640 --> 59:04.240
A puzzle to be solved.

59:06.760 --> 59:11.880
But if you are sentient
and if you will depart...

59:12.000 --> 59:16.160
Frankenstein, if you give me a companion,
I will quit Europe for ever.

59:16.280 --> 59:20.960
I will vanish into air. I will be gone.
There will be no more destruction.

59:21.080 --> 59:25.160
― Will you swear to be peaceful?
― Yes! I beg you to believe me!

59:25.280 --> 59:27.480
If you were to leave here,
never to return, ever,

59:27.600 --> 59:30.160
and if you were to swear,
and to swear solemnly....

59:30.280 --> 59:33.320
I swear by the blue sky,
by the white snow,

59:33.440 --> 59:36.320
by the fire of love
that burns in my heart,

59:36.440 --> 59:40.080
that if you grant my request
you will never have to look on me again

59:40.200 --> 59:42.240
for as long as the world turns around!

59:42.360 --> 59:45.840
― You think it turns around?
― Well, of course!

59:45.960 --> 59:47.680
(LAUGHTER)

59:50.440 --> 59:52.720
You must understand, the work is hard.

59:52.840 --> 59:56.040
You alone can do it.
You alone have the skill.

59:56.160 --> 1:00:00.560
I alone, in the whole world!

1:00:02.280 --> 1:00:04.280
With no one to share the secret.

1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:12.680
Look, down there. Do you see?

1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:15.680
Little men, with their little lives!

1:00:15.800 --> 1:00:18.760
― Little houses! Little men!
― I am different.

1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:21.640
You, you are a king, a king of science.

1:00:21.760 --> 1:00:24.920
Build me a woman.
Please! I beg you! A bride.

1:00:25.040 --> 1:00:27.240
A bride should be beautiful.

1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:29.920
A bride should have pretty eyes
and shining hair.

1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:32.400
She should not be hideous.
She should be as lovely as possible.

1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:34.440
― Oh, yes!
― I will not repeat my mistakes.

1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:36.600
We can only go forward,
we can never go back.

1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:39.720
Master, work your magic once more.
I beg you!

1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:42.760
A female?
I'd never even considered the question.

1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:46.440
There are differences, of course,
of anatomy, but also differences of what?

1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:49.160
― Of humour, temperament, skill?
― I don't know!

1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:51.920
― What are females good at?
― I don't know!

1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:55.160
My God, what a challenge!

1:00:55.280 --> 1:01:00.680
If I could build something immaculate,
something that I could exhibit.

1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:04.080
Not a demon, but a goddess!

1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:06.360
― A goddess!
― Yes!

1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:08.680
If she was perfect...

1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:12.840
If she was indistinguishable from...

1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:17.800
Imagine that!

1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:23.040
Oh, I may be damned,
but I will attempt it.

1:01:24.200 --> 1:01:30.120
― You will comply with my request?
― I will comply with your request.

1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:33.920
If you give me your word
that afterward you will leave us be.

1:01:34.040 --> 1:01:37.520
I will! If you give me your word
that you will do it!

1:01:43.520 --> 1:01:45.080
What's that for?

1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:48.480
― You shake it.
― I shake it?

1:01:48.600 --> 1:01:51.960
We seal the bargain. Take my hand.

1:02:10.920 --> 1:02:15.120
Th... Th... Thank... Thank you.

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:17.720
Thank you.

1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:22.080
My dream's come true!

1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:25.960
Go home. Begin at once!

1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:30.520
― At home? I can't this at home!
― Why not? What happens at home?

1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:35.080
― Do this work in my father's house? No!
― Then go where you need to.

1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:37.280
I will be watching!

1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:39.240

The Lord giveth,
and the Lord taketh away, sir.

I know, Clarice, I know.

1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:35.360
VICTOR: Out.

1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:47.040
― Victor! Where have you been?
― In the mountains, on the sea of ice.

1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:50.120
This is a house of death.
It is no time to go adventuring!

1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:52.720
Father, I must leave at once.
I have to make a long journey today.

1:03:52.840 --> 1:03:54.400
Today?

1:03:54.520 --> 1:03:57.200
― What about William?
― William?

1:03:57.320 --> 1:03:59.720
Well, he isn't coming.

1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:02.840
― I must go to England. Goodbye.
― England? Why?

1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:06.520
― Work.
― For a year I haven't seen you work!

1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:08.880
What is this work
for which you must decamp to England?

1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:12.040
― I don't expect you to understand...
― No, I do not understand!

1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:14.120
I do not believe
your studies are so important.

1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:15.680
I order you to remain for the funeral!

1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:17.840
I have no intention of obeying.
I must go.

1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:19.880
― And your wedding?
― It will have to be postponed.

1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.160
― But Elizabeth...
― Elizabeth will wait.

1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:27.760
I was in Ingolstadt for six years. A
little longer won't make much difference.

1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:30.160
Victor, why are you so sad?

1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:33.240
― When your mother was dying...
― Please do not bring her into this!

1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:36.000
When your mother was dying,
I gave a promise

1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:38.800
that I would see you wed
your cousin Elizabeth.

1:04:38.920 --> 1:04:42.920
That was my wife's last wish,
that you might be happily married.

1:04:43.800 --> 1:04:46.560
You were such a brilliant child,
a carefree child,

1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:49.800
alert and inquisitive,
the joy of our days!

1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:54.160
I came to believe you would do
great things and I would be proud of you!

1:04:54.280 --> 1:04:59.480
Instead, we have this sullenness,
this melancholy, this low fog of gloom.

1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:04.080
You flout my authority! You do not respect
the codes by which we live!

1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:06.640
If you insist on leaving,
I cannot stop you,

1:05:06.760 --> 1:05:08.920
but you may tell
your fiancée yourself.

1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:10.800
Elizabeth?

1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:13.120
Where is the boy I remember?

1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:18.320
Where is he, Victor? Where has he gone?

1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:30.280
(EERIE SIGH OF ICY BREATH)

1:05:36.840 --> 1:05:39.400
Your father tells me you are leaving us.

1:05:40.280 --> 1:05:43.840
Why, Victor?
Why must you go to England?

1:05:45.440 --> 1:05:49.320
Because in England they are
at the forefront of electro-chemistry.

1:05:49.440 --> 1:05:52.280
I've read of breakthroughs by vitalists,
galvanists.

1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:55.440
― I must see for myself!
― For that, you'll put off our wedding?

1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:59.160
― Yes. It's critical for my experiments.
― What are your experiments?

1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:01.400
I'd say they're well beyond
a woman's scope.

1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:04.120
Which part might be beyond my scope?

1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:07.000
All of it, actually.

1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:09.880
Are you suggesting
I'm less intelligent than you?

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:12.080
Yes.

1:06:12.200 --> 1:06:15.840
― Well, I mean less educated.
― Well, that's hardly my fault.

1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:18.240
I wasn't allowed to go to school.

1:06:19.040 --> 1:06:21.440
But I can learn, Victor.

1:06:21.560 --> 1:06:24.600
― I could be your assistant.
― Hm. What is a Voltaic pile?

1:06:24.720 --> 1:06:28.400
― A Leyden jar? Electric eggs?
― You know perfectly well I don't know.

1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:31.160
― What is a Voltaic pile?
― For storing an electrostatic charge.

1:06:31.280 --> 1:06:34.240
― You link several jars in parallel...
― Oh, please, take me with you.

1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:38.080
― It sounds so exciting!
― Firstly, I will to Oxford,

1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:42.280
spend several months at the university,
there is nothing exciting about that.

1:06:42.400 --> 1:06:44.480
― I don't care! I'll come.
― I'll be in the library all day.

1:06:44.600 --> 1:06:46.920
I'll be as quiet as a mouse. Let me come!

1:06:47.040 --> 1:06:49.360
Subsequently,
I will travel to the isles of Scotland,

1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:51.360
barren rocks in a barren ocean.

1:06:51.480 --> 1:06:55.040
― It is, I am told, an awful place.
― I don't care! We'll be together!

1:06:55.160 --> 1:06:59.480
― It is no situation for a woman!
― And do you think this is?

1:07:01.320 --> 1:07:07.440
The world is turning, Victor, and
I'm sitting in Switzerland, watching it!

1:07:07.560 --> 1:07:11.760
I know it's picturesque, the mountains,
the lake, but it's so quiet,

1:07:11.880 --> 1:07:15.760
it's oppressive and the people are dull.

1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:23.320
I want to go to Paris, Rome, America!

1:07:23.440 --> 1:07:26.720
I want to talk to you about your work,

1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:31.240
about the world, about music,
politics, everything!

1:07:31.360 --> 1:07:35.800
― I have no interest in music or politics.
― Have you any interest in me?

1:07:39.120 --> 1:07:42.720
You are beautiful.

1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:49.920
You will make a beautiful wife.

1:07:51.480 --> 1:07:54.240
Victor, what do you think I am,
a specimen?

1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:00.840
May I ask you something?

1:08:01.960 --> 1:08:04.440
I want to have children.

1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:06.800
― Do you want to have children?
― Yes, of course...

1:08:06.920 --> 1:08:11.480
― No. Do you want to give me children?
― God willing, yes I do.

1:08:12.920 --> 1:08:15.200
Then show me how you'll give me children.

1:08:17.559 --> 1:08:19.639
Kiss me, Victor.

1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:34.719
Touch me.

1:08:35.639 --> 1:08:37.880
Feel my heart beat!

Must you go?

1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:42.680
Can't you stay?

1:08:44.760 --> 1:08:47.000
I wish I could stay.

1:08:48.399 --> 1:08:50.479
I... I cannot.

1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:54.440
Then go and do your work,
and be brilliant!

And after that, come home to me

1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:03.120

and give me a dozen children!

My field, you see, is the human anatomy.

1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:44.120
The human body.

1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:48.880
To progress my research,
I require certain materials.

1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:52.639
It's an unorthodox discipline and somewhat
disapproved of in academic circles,

1:10:52.760 --> 1:10:56.000
but you have my word
that it is for the public good.

1:10:56.120 --> 1:10:59.600
Oh, I don't like the sound o' that!

1:11:00.559 --> 1:11:05.160
Quiet, Rab!
We don't move in academic circles.

1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:08.320
Go on, sir. It's illegal, I take it?

over sickness and disease?

that's all I can say.

1:13:09.160 --> 1:13:12.960
― I find her terrible skinny.
― I said the sister.

1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:17.360
― The sister's fatter. Uncle Ewan?
― Aye.

1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:20.639
― What's he going to do?
― I don't know.

1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:24.719
― This is no' right, Uncle Ewan.
― As the man said, they're dead!

1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:27.360
They're no' coming back. Are you ready?

1:13:27.480 --> 1:13:29.480
Aye.

1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:37.360
― Aye, sir.
― Good. Haul it to the boat, Ewan.

1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:39.600
― This is only the first.
― Is it, sir?

1:13:39.719 --> 1:13:42.360
I shall need a regular supply
of internal organs.

1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:53.480
Quiet, Rab. Meat for the dogs.

1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:26.680

1:14:30.559 --> 1:14:34.080
And will he fashion me a beauty
from this filth?

1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:39.040

― William!
― So how do you do it?

1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:47.120
― It's late, you should be in bed.
― How do you bring dead things to life?

1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:50.360
― Is it easy?
― No, it's hard.

1:16:52.160 --> 1:16:55.120
― It's some kind of miracle.
― Tell me the secret.

1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:57.880
― When did you start?
― At school.

1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:01.800
Did you bring the teachers to life?
That really would be a miracle.

1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:07.280
School was so boring!

1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:17.120
I wanted to find out why things exist,
how things exist.

1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:21.400
Not absurd divinity and idiotic music,

1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:23.639
but the laws of existence!

1:17:23.760 --> 1:17:26.160
I started to read forbidden books ―
Agrippa, Paracelsus.

1:17:26.280 --> 1:17:28.719
― The alchemists!
― Yes! They were true men of science.

1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:31.760
They mapped the heavens.
They tracked the course of the stars.

1:17:31.880 --> 1:17:36.400
They analysed and categorised the air
we breathe, the circulation of the blood.

1:17:36.520 --> 1:17:38.639
All of modern medicine comes from them.

1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:41.680
I too wished to penetrate nature.

1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:45.639
Lay bare her deepest mysteries.

1:17:45.760 --> 1:17:48.320
So I studied mathematics.

1:17:48.440 --> 1:17:50.840
― I experimented with galvanism...
― What's that?

1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:53.880
You induce spasms in inanimate flesh
with a current from a chloride battery.

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:56.840
A zinc plate's laid on a solution
of ammonium chloride and Ceylon moss.

1:17:56.960 --> 1:17:59.200
― How thrilling!
― And as I watched the current arc

1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:01.960
between bismuth and antimony
I found myself asking,

1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:05.559
where does the principle of life,
the actual spark of life,

1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:07.400
where does it come from?

1:18:07.520 --> 1:18:11.559
― It comes from God.
― Yes, but only from God?

1:18:11.680 --> 1:18:14.920
― I don't know.
― Can a man be a god?

1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:18.760
― I don't know!
― Well, I had to find out.

1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:22.880
― So off to the graveyard I went.
― Oh, Victor! Yuk!

1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:25.880
I watched flesh rot in the soil,
I watched worms eat eyes,

1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.200
maggots chew the tissue of the brain.

1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:30.559
I went to charnel-houses, executions.

1:18:30.680 --> 1:18:34.360
I watched the moment of change from life
to death, the specificity of the moment,

1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:38.000
the annihilation of the spark,
until suddenly, months later,

1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:41.680
in a fever of creativity, I found
that I could identify and replicate

1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:45.040
― the prime cause of life!
― What is it?

1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:48.840
I can't tell you that, Will,
you're only little.

1:18:48.960 --> 1:18:51.120
What are you going to do with it?

1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:53.280
I don't know.

1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:24.800
― Will they reproduce?
― What?

1:19:24.920 --> 1:19:27.800
Will they have wombs, the females?

1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:30.600
Will they breed?
How quickly will they breed?

1:19:30.719 --> 1:19:34.719
How fast is the cycle?
How many in a litter?

1:19:34.840 --> 1:19:38.680
― 50? 100? 1,000?
― William!

1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:42.639

the children, will they do your bidding?

1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:45.160
― What are you saying?
― You are their king.

Listen!

1:28:46.800 --> 1:28:50.000
You can still hear the bells ringing
over the water.

1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:53.600
― So you can.
― Many congratulations, mistress.

1:28:53.719 --> 1:28:56.360
― It was a splendid day.
― Thank you.

1:28:56.480 --> 1:28:59.200
― Will you please get me ready for bed?
― Yes, mistress.

1:28:59.320 --> 1:29:02.160
― I want to look beautiful.
― Yes, mistress.

1:29:02.280 --> 1:29:06.240
― Perhaps then he'll...
― I'm sure he will.

1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:10.480
He never touches me, Clarice.

1:29:10.600 --> 1:29:15.240
He never comes near.
He barely spoke to me after the service.

1:29:15.360 --> 1:29:18.760
Well, he has always been peculiar.

1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:23.360
― What have I done wrong?
― You've done nothing, mistress.

1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:27.960

as we are on their wedding night.

1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:31.040

whatsoever.

― I'm not nervous.
― I know you're not, mistress.

1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:43.200

― Where is he?
― He'll be along shortly, mistress.

1:30:08.280 --> 1:30:10.639

1:30:10.760 --> 1:30:13.480

― We have men down at the lake.

Good. Wait for me outside.
I'll join you presently.

1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:40.400
― Victor, what is going on?
― There are guards at every door.

1:30:40.520 --> 1:30:43.680
― The house is secured.
― Why? What is going on? Tell me.

1:30:44.880 --> 1:30:48.920
― I should have told you before.
― Yes, I think you should!

1:30:50.559 --> 1:30:53.000
It is one of my experiments, Elizabeth.

1:30:54.559 --> 1:30:57.440
You will find this hard to credit,
and there is little time to explain,

1:30:57.559 --> 1:31:00.200
but the simple fact is, I...

1:31:00.320 --> 1:31:02.920
I built a man.

1:31:05.120 --> 1:31:07.559
― You did what?
― I built a man.

1:31:07.680 --> 1:31:11.840
And succeeded in animating him.

1:31:11.960 --> 1:31:14.400
― Say that again?
― I built a man!

1:31:14.520 --> 1:31:17.040
"Animating him"?

1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:20.320
― Do you mean bringing him to life?
― Yes, bringing him to life.

1:31:20.440 --> 1:31:24.920
― My creature, I brought him to life!
― Your creature?

1:31:26.760 --> 1:31:29.480
― You don't believe me.
― Yes.

1:31:29.600 --> 1:31:31.600
Yes, I do.

1:31:31.719 --> 1:31:34.639
If you say you have made a creature
and brought him to life,

1:31:34.760 --> 1:31:37.600
then I do believe you, of course.

1:31:37.719 --> 1:31:41.520
― What is it, like a puppet?
― No, it is a man, a functioning man!

1:31:41.639 --> 1:31:44.559
― A brute of a man!
― Well, this is ridiculous.

1:31:44.680 --> 1:31:47.280
You are telling me that you've made
some sort of creature,

1:31:47.400 --> 1:31:49.680
with your electric eggs, presumably,
and it ― what?

1:31:49.800 --> 1:31:52.240
It pursues me.

1:31:52.360 --> 1:31:57.160
Victor, you have been very ill.
In Scotland you had a nervous collapse.

1:31:57.280 --> 1:32:00.120
There is a thing out there
and it means to destroy me!

1:32:00.240 --> 1:32:05.280
I have lured it here and now I must act.
I must kill him before he kills me!

1:32:05.400 --> 1:32:09.040
― What do you mean you have lured it here?
― I knew he would come for...

1:32:09.160 --> 1:32:12.360
For the... For the...

1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:14.440

1:32:14.559 --> 1:32:19.040
Did you send him an invitation?
(GASPS) Victor, he wasn't on the list(!)

1:32:19.160 --> 1:32:22.800
Elizabeth!
This is serious, I beg you to believe me.

1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:30.440
You are asking me to believe that
you have created some sort of monster?

1:32:30.559 --> 1:32:33.080
― Yes, yes...
― Why?

1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:36.040
― I beg your pardon?
― Why?

1:32:37.360 --> 1:32:39.360
Why did you do that?

1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:45.320
Because I had a vision.

1:32:46.800 --> 1:32:50.520
A vision of perfection.

1:32:53.120 --> 1:32:59.840
I followed Nature into her lair,
and I stripped her of her secrets.

1:33:01.360 --> 1:33:06.440
I have brought torrents of light
into a darkening world.

1:33:08.120 --> 1:33:11.600
I did it, Elizabeth, I did it!

1:33:13.639 --> 1:33:15.840
I have never doubted your brilliance.

1:33:15.960 --> 1:33:18.200
I have beaten death!

1:33:18.320 --> 1:33:21.400
I have done it! I made a living thing!

1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:25.680
― But if you wanted to create life...
― Yes, that's exactly what I wanted!

1:33:25.800 --> 1:33:28.600
Then why not just give me a child?

1:33:28.719 --> 1:33:32.320
― We could have married years ago!
― No, that's not...

1:33:32.440 --> 1:33:36.480
Because that is how we create life,
Victor.

1:33:36.600 --> 1:33:39.320
― That is the usual way.
― I am talking about science!

1:33:39.440 --> 1:33:41.160
No.

1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:43.559
You are talking about pride.

1:33:44.840 --> 1:33:47.360
You've been trying God's work.

1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:51.559
Is that what you're telling me?
And it has gone awry.

1:33:53.440 --> 1:33:57.320
In you I found paradise,
but the apple is eaten.

1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:00.800
We cannot go back.

1:34:02.040 --> 1:34:07.240
You've meddled with the natural order
and led us into chaos

1:34:07.360 --> 1:34:11.200
because you worship
the gods of electricity and gas.

1:34:12.639 --> 1:34:15.000
What is wrong with you men?

1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:18.520
I will kill this thing which I foolishly
made and then I will come back to you.

Please, don't go! Hold me, please!

1:34:21.240 --> 1:34:23.920

did he?

1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:02.440

1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:09.000
Do not scream. I will release you.

― Do you think he's clever?

1:35:49.680 --> 1:35:52.639
― A genius!
― Yes, that's right!

1:35:55.719 --> 1:35:58.880
― What is your name?
― My name?

1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:02.480
What luxury that would be!
He didn't give me one.

1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:06.600
Touch.

1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:16.840
What do you feel, Elizabeth?

1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:19.639
― Heat.
― And here?

1:36:21.719 --> 1:36:25.000
― A heartbeat.
― Just like yours.

1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:28.760
Now if you please,

1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:30.639
we'll have none of that!

1:36:35.800 --> 1:36:39.840
― You say you have a grievance?
― Madam!

1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:45.760
Your husband is a good man,
but he does not keep his word.

1:36:45.880 --> 1:36:49.280
If you had a child and it looked like me,
would you abandon it?

1:36:49.400 --> 1:36:52.160
― I'd never abandon a child.
― Are you sure?

1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:54.360
― I'm sure.
― No matter how repulsive?

1:36:54.480 --> 1:36:56.440
― I am sure!
― Well, he did!

1:36:56.559 --> 1:37:00.600
He left me because I look like this,
because I am different.

1:37:00.719 --> 1:37:05.200
If Victor has treated you poorly,
I shall speak to him.

1:37:05.320 --> 1:37:07.559
― You may count on that.
― Isn't he coming to bed?

1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:10.000
He must learn to take responsibility
for his actions...

1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:12.880
Surely he desires you
on your wedding night?

1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.719
..and that we must always
stand up for the disadvantaged.

1:37:15.840 --> 1:37:18.639
Absolutely!
Give voice to the oppressed.

1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:22.080
― Will you put my case?
― What is it you want?

1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:29.200
I did not ask to be born,
but once born, I will fight to live.

1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:31.880
All life is precious ― even mine.

1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:37.040
He promised to give me
the only thing I lack,

1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:41.600
the only thing I need to be content,
but then he...

1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.040
..he broke his word.

1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:51.600

I will not hurt you, I promise.

1:38:12.639 --> 1:38:15.320
I am educated.

1:38:16.200 --> 1:38:19.040

1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:32.440

― Yes, you.

1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:42.040
Perhaps I am a genius, too?

Perhaps you are.

1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:48.360
What are you good at?

1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:54.320
I am good at the art of assimilation.

1:38:55.360 --> 1:38:57.600
I have watched and listened and learned.

1:38:57.719 --> 1:39:01.760
At first, I knew nothing at all,
but I studied the ways of men

1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:04.440
and slowly I learnt how to ruin,

1:39:04.559 --> 1:39:08.080
how to hate,
how to debase, how to humiliate.

1:39:08.200 --> 1:39:12.600
And at the feet of my master,
I learnt the highest of human skills,

1:39:12.719 --> 1:39:15.280
the skill no other creature owns.

1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:18.320
I finally learnt how to lie.

1:39:19.280 --> 1:39:20.800
Lie?

1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:25.760
Tonight I have met someone...

Thank you for trying to understand.

1:39:35.719 --> 1:39:38.200
But he broke his promise,

1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:40.880
so I break mine.

― I mean resurrect her!
― What are you saying?

1:41:55.920 --> 1:41:58.440
― CLARICE: He's gone mad, sir!
― I'm not mad.

1:41:58.559 --> 1:42:02.160
I have powers beyond your comprehension.
How dare you call me mad?

1:42:02.280 --> 1:42:04.960
Victor, this is not godly!
I cannot bear it!

1:42:05.080 --> 1:42:10.440
You! Wherever you are, whenever you turn
behind you, I will be there!

First William, now Elizabeth!

It is superb!

1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:22.840
Take him away! He's monstrous!

1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:26.400
Oh, dear God, please forgive me.

1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:30.040
― Sir, be still.
― What have I brought into this world?

1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:32.120
You did your best.

1:42:36.840 --> 1:42:38.360
I failed.

It stinks.

1:43:30.960 --> 1:43:33.920
My mind,
once filled with dreams of beauty,

1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:37.280
is a furnace of revenge!

1:43:41.080 --> 1:43:43.400
Three years ago, when I was born,

1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:49.440
I laughed for joy at the heat of the sun,

1:43:49.559 --> 1:43:52.280
I cried at the call of the birds.

1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:56.120
The world was a cornucopia to me!

1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:03.600
Now, it is a waste of frost and snow.

1:44:09.400 --> 1:44:12.559
The son becomes the father.

1:44:14.719 --> 1:44:17.960
The master, the slave.

1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:28.360
I have led him across the Black Sea,
through Tartary and Russia.

1:44:30.120 --> 1:44:34.080
I have led him past Archangel
and out on to the ice.

1:44:35.160 --> 1:44:37.680
We go north, always north.

1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:44.680
His dogs are dead,

1:44:46.200 --> 1:44:49.200
But we have a compact we must keep.

1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:52.480

Lovely Elizabeth.

I can still taste her lips,
her...strawberry lips.

I can still feel her warm breasts,
her thighs.

don't tell me you are dead already!

Don't you have more stamina than that?
We've hardly started!

Don't leave me.
