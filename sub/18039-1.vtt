14:33.207 --> 14:34.708
Are you alone here, mam?

14:35.125 --> 14:38.629

15:22.589 --> 15:25.968

way out of here?

15:30.764 --> 15:31.765
What do you mean?

15:32.140 --> 15:33.642
Like a back road or something.
Something we can go around

15:33.767 --> 15:36.270

-There's a force service road,

15:36.728 --> 15:38.230

it is and I'm not gonna drive

15:38.438 --> 15:41.316

get very far with this...

15:43.861 --> 15:46.363

18:19.433 --> 18:21.810
Isn't that deep enough?

18:37.534 --> 18:40.204
More effort, maybe.

18:41.455 --> 18:42.956
Ups, sorry.

19:00.140 --> 19:03.143
Hey! I can use some

20:36.236 --> 20:39.031
He's alive.
-It's good. -What?

20:39.364 --> 20:42.367
He tried to kill me. He's

20:42.659 --> 20:44.786
Forget it. Look, if you gonna
kill him its murder right now.

20:44.620 --> 20:46.747

What? -He's your husband,
you can still work things out.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.586
Not exactly.

20:52.628 --> 20:54.213
Why?

20:56.131 --> 20:57.132
He's not my husband.

20:57.508 --> 21:00.594
Excuse me. -My husband is
Karl. That one is cheater.

21:00.719 --> 21:03.096
My last name is Dumas.

21:06.183 --> 21:09.436
Is not your husband
why you shoot him?

21:11.063 --> 21:13.482
Do we really have to
go in need this now?

21:13.482 --> 21:15.609
Now will be good, yeah.

21:18.278 --> 21:21.240
He wanted money from me.

21:22.241 --> 21:23.951
Why?

21:24.076 --> 21:27.079
For something
that I didn't do.

21:27.204 --> 21:29.122
Like?

21:29.915 --> 21:33.877
What? -He at photograph of me
in some cheap motel room doing

21:33.877 --> 21:36.505
things they are...I even
don't know what they are...

21:36.839 --> 21:39.716
and he drug me and I think
that's how he got me there...

21:41.885 --> 21:45.222
Look like I sleep with him,
but I didn't do.

21:47.391 --> 21:48.684
OK?

21:48.976 --> 21:52.354
Ok, so, he blackmail here.
-Well, what do you think I just said?

21:54.314 --> 21:57.109
Did you give him,
I mean, money?

21:57.109 --> 22:00.779
No, that's why I shoot him.

22:02.322 --> 22:05.868
He came over to the house,
threating to show Carl photographs

22:05.868 --> 22:09.079
and you don't know Carl.
If Carl ever saw any of those pictures,

22:09.079 --> 22:11.540
I mean it, even he can
thought I having affair.

22:11.540 --> 22:13.876
He would kill me.

22:14.501 --> 22:17.087
Where is Carl now?

22:17.087 --> 22:19.256
He's run a business
for a couple of days.

22:19.715 --> 22:23.844
That's why he came that fat,
greedy pig in the first place.

22:24.553 --> 22:27.848
When I think put his hands over me,
I get shoot him all over again.

22:28.807 --> 22:30.434
I'm judging from the
first time you shoot him,

22:30.684 --> 22:33.687
as not much as a threat.
-Well, I can't just let him go.

22:33.687 --> 22:37.441
What is he given Carl to
show the photographs?

22:37.858 --> 22:40.027
Well, don't expect me
to kill of you.

22:40.027 --> 22:42.154
You have a reason and I have doubts.
-Well, I don't want to kill him

22:42.154 --> 22:45.115
I just want him dead.

22:49.536 --> 22:53.040
So, what should we do?
-I don't know.

22:53.707 --> 22:55.918
Shit, I thought you

22:56.043 --> 22:57.669
If I knew is going be

23:18.690 --> 23:21.944
What we gonna do? -I just
want to hell out from here.

23:21.944 --> 23:24.154
We got to keep moving.

23:52.307 --> 23:56.603
How do you meet this
asshole anyway?

23:57.145 --> 23:59.857
Carl bought some life
insurance from him.

24:00.274 --> 24:02.568
That's why I knew him

24:02.609 --> 24:06.196

some girlfriends that I barnt he.

24:06.321 --> 24:09.658

26:19.037 --> 26:22.541
So, you go in and you write

26:22.541 --> 26:24.877

Shut up! You will talk,
when we will be ready for listen.

27:31.527 --> 27:34.446
I'm not the only one. They
just one he took of me.

27:34.446 --> 27:36.448
Where you get them?
-In the trunk.

27:36.490 --> 27:38.992
He have lots of them.

27:39.535 --> 27:41.537
But how they get
into your car?

27:41.703 --> 27:44.206
That's is not my car,
it's his car.

27:44.581 --> 27:48.293
We're driving his car? -Why
can't take it if he lives us car?

27:48.460 --> 27:49.711
Yeah, but it not given to me.

27:49.628 --> 27:52.130
You need it a car,
I can't give you mine.

27:52.631 --> 27:53.674
How can explain this to Carl.

27:54.508 --> 27:57.511
Here, just let me
show you something.

28:00.848 --> 28:03.433
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:03.433 --> 28:06.520
They were all taken
in the same motel.

28:08.021 --> 28:10.649
Actually, they were
taken in the same room.

28:10.649 --> 28:13.235
Look at this. Is the same
bed, the same wall,

28:13.318 --> 28:15.863
the same picture over the bed. You
know where this motel is? -No.

28:17.781 --> 28:21.827
Oh, my God. That's Carol Ramzy.
She's a friend of mine.

28:21.493 --> 28:25.789
And Ann... this one is a checker
abursin. They know her to.

28:26.164 --> 28:28.166
This is a picture of you.
-Oh, God.

28:28.458 --> 28:30.460
Even if you get rid of all this,
his probably kind of store them

28:30.460 --> 28:33.964
in computer somewhere.

28:34.965 --> 28:36.258
Look at this.

28:36.592 --> 28:40.429
Jesus, a lot of women here.
Look at all those numbers.

28:40.721 --> 28:43.182
It's probably how much
must to paying him.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.643
It's kind of scary, I think.
-I think, I can kill him now.

28:46.643 --> 28:48.145
No, no.
Look, look.

28:48.645 --> 28:49.646
If he tail's on you,
you tail on him.

28:49.688 --> 28:52.065
This book and this photos,
you kind a big time,

28:52.399 --> 28:54.193
you can put him
away for years.

28:54.526 --> 28:55.694
And what about me?

28:55.694 --> 28:56.904
What'll happened with all others
women? What'll happens

28:56.904 --> 28:58.238
when all this comes out?

28:58.572 --> 29:01.575
Can you just focus on you
first, all right, and me?

29:02.034 --> 29:04.119
I get some food,
you stay with him.

29:04.411 --> 29:07.706
I'm not staying here with him by
myself. -I'm not gonna call with him.

29:07.831 --> 29:09.958
He's your problem. I have
enough at my own, thank you.

29:10.459 --> 29:11.710
How do I know
you'll come back?

29:11.752 --> 29:13.712
How do I know you will not
call the cops, as soon as

29:13.837 --> 29:16.590
I walk out the door?
-What if he gets loose?

29:38.487 --> 29:41.365
I think, is not
go anywhere now.

29:41.698 --> 29:42.866
Feel better?

29:43.075 --> 29:45.077
Yeah.

29:56.046 --> 29:58.715
I'll be back in
half of hour, OK?

30:00.008 --> 30:03.637
What do you want?
-I don't care.

30:03.887 --> 30:05.889
You got to eat something.

30:06.265 --> 30:08.559
I'm not hungry.
-Yeah, but you gonna be hungry

30:08.725 --> 30:12.229
and I don't want to stop again.
I want out of here in two hours.

30:12.729 --> 30:15.315
Then get me a salad.

30:16.525 --> 30:21.196
What kind a dress on?
-No, dress on.

30:22.197 --> 30:25.742
I'm not gonna back
for salad dresser.

30:26.201 --> 30:28.328
Well, then get me a sari
thousand alen and sari buchy

30:28.328 --> 30:30.998
that one is crmy Italian.

30:31.415 --> 30:32.916
Why you just make
up your mind now?

30:33.292 --> 30:35.294
I mix them all together.

30:36.211 --> 30:40.090
Well, you'll not get you
enough anyways.

30:43.010 --> 30:46.680
You are good now?
-Yeah.

30:47.389 --> 30:51.143
Oh, and don't
take the wrong car.

30:57.024 --> 30:59.985
Wait.

31:00.194 --> 31:01.195
Now what?

31:02.154 --> 31:03.864
I have to pee.

31:04.865 --> 31:06.909
So, pee.

31:07.034 --> 31:09.953
Somebody using the toilets.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.624
Nobody using the bath tub.

31:13.665 --> 31:17.002
I'm not pee in the bath
tub with that brub.

31:17.377 --> 31:19.880
He can't see you. -I know,
but I can see him.

31:21.298 --> 31:23.133
Well, put the
towel over his head.

33:20.918 --> 33:23.170
At last.

33:23.504 --> 33:25.756
I'm alone.
It's OK.

35:48.607 --> 35:51.985
Is everything OK?
-Yeah.

35:55.197 --> 35:57.908
How much food did you buy?

35:59.284 --> 36:01.787
Some for you, some for me
and some for him.

36:01.787 --> 36:04.498
You buy food for him?

36:04.831 --> 36:07.918
I'm not gonna starving
him to death.

36:10.629 --> 36:13.715
What do you watch it?
-I don't know.

36:13.715 --> 36:15.968
Here, you can turn
if you want.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.694
What did you do?

36:33.986 --> 36:34.987
What you mean?

36:35.779 --> 36:38.115
Did you need the
water running?

36:38.240 --> 36:40.117
Where?

36:40.659 --> 36:42.619
In the bathroom.

37:21.909 --> 37:25.329
Oh, shit.

37:32.669 --> 37:35.422
Cloe is dead. -Yeah,
but we didn't kill him.

37:35.422 --> 37:37.007
It doesn't matter. It's gonna
look like we killed him.

37:37.257 --> 37:39.760
So, let's go. -You can't
just leave him here.

37:41.553 --> 37:42.554
Why is the worse of the dead
body in the trunk then alive one?

37:42.304 --> 37:45.766
It doesn't really
look either way.

37:50.354 --> 37:53.023
I can't find them at all.

37:56.568 --> 37:59.446
Get the door.

38:06.662 --> 38:09.289
My God, he  is even
heavier than before.

38:09.498 --> 38:11.542
Probably cus all the
water he swallow.

38:15.587 --> 38:17.381
Oh, my God.

38:20.384 --> 38:22.678
I'm gonna puke.

39:19.693 --> 39:22.487
Where are we?

39:22.946 --> 39:24.740
Middle of nowhere,
I hope.

39:43.675 --> 39:45.844
Like solid rock.

39:47.930 --> 39:49.932
Have to find another place.

39:51.016 --> 39:54.686
What if somebody
missing him by now?

39:55.145 --> 40:00.526
Well, you know, if he did, it gonna
take a while to find us here.

40:00.901 --> 40:03.862
What if they looking for him,
they gonna looking for his car?

40:03.862 --> 40:06.156
I mean, if we will put over,
how we'll explain that?

40:06.490 --> 40:10.244
How even prove who you are? You don't
even have a driving license. Do you?

40:10.244 --> 40:13.914
We can't get caught
in a car. It ties us to Martin,

40:14.915 --> 40:16.083
whether they find him
or not. -Well,

40:16.250 --> 40:21.255
see, I can't dig a hole big
enough for both of them.

40:24.174 --> 40:26.802
So, what we gonna do?

40:27.135 --> 40:28.971
I don't know.

40:29.179 --> 40:32.140
We can't go back up on the
highway. We can get spotted.

40:32.140 --> 40:35.102
If they looking for him.
-Well, they looking for you.

40:37.855 --> 40:41.149
I can't walk to Mexico.

40:43.443 --> 40:45.904
Shit.

40:47.281 --> 40:50.450
What if we just leave
him in the car up here?

40:51.660 --> 40:53.996
What if someone
drives out here, a?

40:53.996 --> 40:56.248
They'll see a car park
and they gonna stop.

40:56.248 --> 40:59.751
And if they stop... -Yeah.
This is like a real hot spot.

41:00.127 --> 41:04.131
Got to be a lot of cars
ride in past years.

41:10.304 --> 41:15.100
That's been here forever.

41:39.583 --> 41:42.544
Makes sure you get
the door handle.

41:42.920 --> 41:44.129
I was the one
in prison, OK?

41:44.505 --> 41:47.508
You just on the half way.
Make sure you get a window.

41:47.966 --> 41:51.428
Can survive then sleeping,
if they find one of your hear.

41:57.309 --> 41:59.228
Oh, shit.

42:05.776 --> 42:07.945
Oh, my God.
It's my husband.

42:07.945 --> 42:10.405
Don't answer it.
-I have to answer it.

42:10.405 --> 42:12.366
If I'm not answer it, he gonna
think something is wrong.

42:12.407 --> 42:14.409
He's probably doubt already.
-Fine, answer him but

42:14.493 --> 42:17.704
make sure you'll tell him...
-I know, I know. It's time.

42:21.208 --> 42:27.172
Hi, honey. No, I'm
not home right now.

42:31.468 --> 42:35.889
No, I'm just running
some ear.

42:35.973 --> 42:39.560
I should be home in
couple of hours.

42:39.726 --> 42:42.271
When you think
you will be home?

42:42.271 --> 42:45.899
A hard to say,
I'm still time to lose ends here.

42:45.899 --> 42:50.445
OK, well, you make sure you
call me before you come home

42:50.654 --> 42:52.948
so, I can make something
special for you.

42:53.282 --> 42:55.492
You are all the
special I need, honey.

42:55.492 --> 42:57.703
Yeah, I'll call you when
I'm out of here.

42:57.703 --> 43:01.123
I love you.
-I love you.

43:10.215 --> 43:13.677
I'm so good.

43:38.577 --> 43:41.580
Jesus.

43:55.385 --> 43:59.264
All right. We have
everything?

44:06.897 --> 44:07.648
OK.

44:46.979 --> 44:48.772
What happened?

44:49.439 --> 44:51.775
How should I know.

44:54.736 --> 44:58.574
Oh, my God.
He's still alive.

44:58.907 --> 45:01.243
Can't be.

45:40.949 --> 45:44.161
I got him.
I got him.

46:04.765 --> 46:07.643
How far can it go?

46:08.393 --> 46:11.355
Couple of hundreds of miles
is kind a have to leak.

46:34.753 --> 46:43.554
Well.

46:46.014 --> 46:48.642
Is that's all right?

46:48.767 --> 46:50.769
Yeah.

46:57.734 --> 46:59.486
OK.

46:59.486 --> 47:03.615
Ok, all right.

47:03.866 --> 47:07.619
I figure, less town
we get to,

47:07.703 --> 47:13.208
we buy a used car, just some
might can go to Mexico.

47:13.542 --> 47:15.627
But why?

47:15.961 --> 47:17.963
I really don't have
much money on me.

47:21.008 --> 47:23.385
It was a credit card.

47:23.385 --> 47:27.514
I'm sure you can get a car
for just a couple thousand.

47:28.682 --> 47:34.980
Try some hundred.
That's all what it left.

47:37.482 --> 47:39.610
Oh, shit.

47:39.818 --> 47:41.320
Oh, shit.
-What? -My purse.

47:41.737 --> 47:43.739
I lost my purse.

47:44.448 --> 47:47.576
Where? -I don't know,
I don't know.

47:47.951 --> 47:49.953
What you mean don't
know, it's your purse.

47:51.455 --> 47:51.997
You just how...
What?

47:51.997 --> 47:53.999
I lefted in the car.

47:54.499 --> 47:56.084
What? -I lefted
in the car.

47:56.084 --> 47:59.171
Karl collected my phone in my
purse and it was not my purse...

48:00.297 --> 48:03.091
You telling me, everything
is in that purse,

48:03.258 --> 48:06.762
your wallet, your credit cards,
your money?

48:10.641 --> 48:13.560
Oh, God.

49:52.367 --> 49:54.703
I'm not sure,

49:54.870 --> 49:58.498
this much better then
being in the prison.

49:58.624 --> 50:03.921
Got no money, no car
and no gun.

50:04.421 --> 50:09.051
What I gonna do? Rob the liquor
store with my teeth?

50:09.051 --> 50:11.220
Is that what you done?

50:11.595 --> 50:15.098
Rob the liquor store?
-No.

50:14.640 --> 50:18.018
So, what did you do?

50:19.645 --> 50:22.439
I didn't do anything.

50:22.689 --> 50:26.652
Well, they don't put people in
the prison for doing nothing.

50:26.735 --> 50:27.736
Yeah, they do.

50:28.612 --> 50:33.200
All right, if you don't
wanna tell me, that's fine.

50:38.664 --> 50:40.832
I'm telling you the truth.

50:42.835 --> 50:47.589
My friend did it.

50:47.965 --> 50:50.759
I was just given
him a ride.

50:50.634 --> 50:54.680
He didn't tell me he's
gonna hit a liquor store.

50:55.639 --> 51:00.102
But I didn't see any matter
to marshal court.

51:03.564 --> 51:08.443
I got fifteen years.
-For that?

51:10.195 --> 51:13.532
Well, he's shoot the guy.

51:19.162 --> 51:21.498
See, I took off.

51:30.257 --> 51:33.635
I have a car in a
back of my house.

51:34.178 --> 51:36.930
We can use that one.

51:37.723 --> 51:41.393
Won't Karl miss it?

51:41.852 --> 51:43.854
That's my problem.

51:44.271 --> 51:45.689
You want a car or not?

51:53.614 --> 51:55.949
You'll do that?

52:32.486 --> 52:36.156
Honey, I'm home.

52:36.323 --> 52:38.825
April.

52:42.955 --> 52:45.624
April.

52:46.250 --> 52:48.961
April.

53:24.162 --> 53:26.123
You are OK?

53:27.207 --> 53:30.252
I'm really thirsty.

53:32.004 --> 53:34.548
You wanna sit down?

53:34.590 --> 53:40.888
Yeah, I'm sorry to.
I'm really tired.

53:41.972 --> 53:43.849
Yeah.

53:44.183 --> 53:48.729
Right here. Put your
arm around me.

53:48.979 --> 53:51.481
OK. Come on.

54:48.914 --> 54:52.835
Sick bitch.
Where is my gun?

55:51.602 --> 55:53.312
Martin!

55:54.062 --> 55:57.524
Martin!

56:01.361 --> 56:04.156
Martin!

57:16.186 --> 57:17.521
Where is he?

57:17.813 --> 57:19.314
Martin, you...

57:19.398 --> 57:21.900
Where the hell are you?

57:23.777 --> 57:25.279
You sun of bitch.
You can't hide from me.

57:25.279 --> 57:27.614
I will find you.

58:44.775 --> 58:48.362
Baby? Baby, are you there?

58:48.695 --> 58:49.905
Hello.

58:50.405 --> 58:52.658
Martin?

58:53.033 --> 58:55.035
Who is this?

59:08.006 --> 59:10.759
Oh, my God.
Karl's car.

59:14.721 --> 59:17.474
I thought you said, he suppose
to call before he got back.

59:17.474 --> 59:19.142
He wants me surprise.

59:21.603 --> 59:24.189
Oh, my phone.
It's gone.

59:24.398 --> 59:26.900
What we gonna do now?

59:30.571 --> 59:33.657
We have to find
way out. -Yeah.

59:35.033 --> 59:38.078
But, how we will do this?

59:39.329 --> 59:44.501
We will wait to until tonight,
to Karl go to sleep.

59:45.210 --> 59:49.006
You can take my car
keys and some money.

59:49.715 --> 59:52.593
OK.
-OK.

59:54.970 --> 59:58.182
I guess, this is a...
this is it, a?

underwear get in our bedroom?

01:01:20.722 --> 01:01:23.225
Those aren't Martin's.
-Well, they aren't mine.

01:01:23.475 --> 01:01:24.977
You don't understand.

01:01:25.185 --> 01:01:27.187

01:01:28.355 --> 01:01:31.024

01:01:31.191 --> 01:01:33.443

-Tell me, where he is.

01:01:33.735 --> 01:01:36.405
Those aren't his.

01:01:36.405 --> 01:01:40.659
He broken into the house.
Those are his underwear.

01:01:40.868 --> 01:01:43.078
That is a crock of shit.

01:01:43.078 --> 01:01:45.539

01:01:45.539 --> 01:01:48.542

01:02:14.776 --> 01:02:16.111
What happened?

01:02:16.111 --> 01:02:19.281
He found the photos,
he saw the barries...

01:02:19.281 --> 01:02:22.367
He skaè your underwear.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.871
Oh, shit.

01:02:32.461 --> 01:02:34.588
This is my problem, Will.

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:39.343
You throughout enough already.
You got out of here...

01:02:41.553 --> 01:02:42.554
Just take my car
and go. -Yeah. I don't think,

01:02:42.763 --> 01:02:45.516
he'll be to understandable
by me if i taken his car

01:02:46.808 --> 01:02:51.230
and I don't think you
can handle him.

01:02:52.105 --> 01:02:56.193
We gonna tell him,
what we did.

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:03.700
And then we find Martin in the
bathroom and he was dead

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.578
because the toilet
was up on him.

01:03:06.995 --> 01:03:09.790
And his hands won't running
because we had to tape to it

01:03:09.998 --> 01:03:11.875
and how he come to
the bath we don't know

01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:15.295
and how he turned on
the water, I don't know.

01:03:15.504 --> 01:03:19.508
But anyways, that's why
we knew to get rid of him, again.

01:03:19.925 --> 01:03:21.802
So, we took him to that desert
place but the ground was to hard

01:03:21.802 --> 01:03:26.473
we can't buried him.
So, we put him in the car.

01:03:26.765 --> 01:03:28.058
It was his car

01:03:28.058 --> 01:03:30.644
and we drove him
off the cliff.

01:03:30.644 --> 01:03:33.021
But I lefted my
purse in the car

01:03:33.146 --> 01:03:35.315
and we have to climb
back to get it.

01:03:35.315 --> 01:03:39.027
And then, it just blow up.
I mean, just blow up.

01:03:39.027 --> 01:03:41.780
My wallet, my credit card,
my money.

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.365
You don't want to
say anything.

01:03:44.283 --> 01:03:49.454
She lost her self-phone too,
but that was later.

01:03:49.496 --> 01:03:52.207
So, then we had try to
go back Sovilkera,

01:03:52.207 --> 01:03:56.336

01:04:46.094 --> 01:04:47.679
but I can't live with
Karl like this.

01:04:47.763 --> 01:04:49.473
He has to believe me.

01:04:49.473 --> 01:04:52.351

both of us.

01:04:57.231 --> 01:04:59.900

Lots of naked women.
Look like he operates

01:05:02.236 --> 01:05:05.489

01:06:31.742 --> 01:06:34.119
Haven't you heard

01:06:34.536 --> 01:06:37.164
You can lie all you want,

01:06:37.206 --> 01:06:39.249
between you and him.
-There's nothing going on

01:06:39.708 --> 01:06:41.668
between me and Will.

01:06:42.169 --> 01:06:43.670

Let me tell you something

01:06:54.223 --> 01:06:57.351
April is not stupid,

01:06:57.351 --> 01:06:59.019
to come up with this,

01:06:59.102 --> 01:07:02.481
You are the one who came
up with this bull shit.

01:07:03.148 --> 01:07:08.946
Karl, everything what we
telling you is the truth.

01:07:09.321 --> 01:07:11.657
Martin's car is down there
at the bottom of that cliff

01:07:11.698 --> 01:07:13.408
and his dead body
is down with it.

01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:15.911

01:07:15.911 --> 01:07:18.080

-All right.

01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:26.630
Well, cut him loose.

01:07:27.089 --> 01:07:29.633
I'm not cutting him loose.

01:07:30.592 --> 01:07:33.679

01:07:39.476 --> 01:07:41.728

Mustang isn't here.

01:08:14.845 --> 01:08:18.682
Is another car in
the garage. Could be the wife's.

01:08:18.932 --> 01:08:22.310

Well, I'm so sorry.

01:15:09.259 --> 01:15:11.261
This is all my fault.

01:15:11.386 --> 01:15:15.682

01:15:14.473 --> 01:15:18.268

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:13.240

01:16:21.164 --> 01:16:23.166

They can get away though.

01:16:30.215 --> 01:16:31.800

Look, where we are.

01:16:42.436 --> 01:16:45.439

01:16:58.410 --> 01:17:01.747

01:17:10.464 --> 01:17:13.467
She was just 29 years old.

01:17:13.509 --> 01:17:15.969
Just 5 years older than me.

01:17:18.096 --> 01:17:21.767
I wonder what she was

01:17:39.535 --> 01:17:42.788

01:18:05.227 --> 01:18:07.938
OK, not them.

01:18:07.938 --> 01:18:12.234
On who you are referring too?
-My wife and her god damn boyfriend,

01:18:12.234 --> 01:18:15.946

and try to kill me, OK?

01:18:17.364 --> 01:18:19.366

Well, we just gonna

01:18:21.618 --> 01:18:25.122
Let's get on with it then.

01:18:36.717 --> 01:18:40.512
We found the body.
-What body?

01:18:40.971 --> 01:18:42.973
Martin Cheeders.

01:18:44.683 --> 01:18:46.685
Wait a minute,
he is dead?

01:18:46.685 --> 01:18:49.479
At the bottom over roving.

01:18:49.479 --> 01:18:51.857
You could see the
smoke from miles.

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:54.943
Found him and his car.

01:18:55.152 --> 01:18:58.155
Oh, my God.

01:18:59.531 --> 01:19:01.992
Then it's true.

01:19:02.242 --> 01:19:05.537
Do you wanna tell
us about it?

01:19:05.996 --> 01:19:08.707
Hell, yeah I do.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:19.051
Probably all came
down on the road

01:19:19.259 --> 01:19:21.678
when no one is there.

01:19:22.054 --> 01:19:24.056
I'll take is waiting for me.

01:19:28.018 --> 01:19:30.604
I have a choice

01:19:30.604 --> 01:19:34.066
to that tired blow
on car ditch but

01:19:33.941 --> 01:19:39.488
when did happen, I didn't
enough to think about them.

01:19:42.783 --> 01:19:47.621
Sometimes, it seems like
the only choice is ulejk,

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:53.252
other choice is already me.

01:19:59.007 --> 01:20:05.138
You just have to be
ready for the nail.

01:20:12.187 --> 01:20:14.898
Who's Sarah like more I do?

01:20:18.861 --> 01:20:23.115
This is something
I have to deal.

01:20:26.368 --> 01:20:30.497
He was duck taped
to the toilet. -Yeah.

01:20:30.956 --> 01:20:32.833
And then is fallen to the
bath and hit his head

01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:35.711
that's why he couldn't get
up and then his drowned.

01:20:35.878 --> 01:20:38.380
We didn't found the toilet.

01:20:38.589 --> 01:20:41.091
Of course not.

01:20:41.091 --> 01:20:44.553
It's in the motel room. -Maybe
you know the name of motel?

01:20:44.553 --> 01:20:47.264
Didn't tell me that. -Why did you
go to Martin's Cheeders house?

01:20:47.264 --> 01:20:51.226
Because I was pist. I came home,
my friend all bed rip it up,

01:20:51.226 --> 01:20:53.645

pictures. So, you know,

01:20:57.733 --> 01:21:00.110

-Yes, we do.

01:21:00.277 --> 01:21:04.781
Well. -You had a history of
domestic violence Mrs. Dumas.

01:21:04.907 --> 01:21:05.908
Oh, you don't think that
I have any to do with it this.

01:21:06.241 --> 01:21:07.743

01:21:31.099 --> 01:21:33.810
Ok.

01:21:34.144 --> 01:21:36.647
I would like to make

01:21:44.154 --> 01:21:47.616
Hello.
-Nolla, it's me.

01:21:48.075 --> 01:21:51.078

Well, we can't go back to my

01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:14.119
We can go to my sister's.

01:23:11.116 --> 01:23:17.122
She doesn't look far
from me. She will help us.

01:23:17.414 --> 01:23:19.041
She doesn't know me.

01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:21.502
Please, you got to
trust me on this.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.253
My sister is an angel.

01:23:23.253 --> 01:23:25.672
She would die for me.

01:23:26.048 --> 01:23:28.759
You got the blood tape back from
the sample took in the house.

01:23:29.092 --> 01:23:31.094
Match it Karl's wife.
We should get the results back

01:23:31.303 --> 01:23:33.805
in a week from DNA
but without the body...

01:23:33.931 --> 01:23:35.057
It's mean,
I need a body.

01:23:35.307 --> 01:23:38.977
What if tie up loose ends. I think
we'll have enough nail this prick.

01:24:03.001 --> 01:24:05.921
Just a second.

01:24:07.714 --> 01:24:11.051

Is something wrong?
What's going on?

01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:20.102

problem is, we'll fix it.

01:24:43.667 --> 01:24:46.587
...and then we had to
duct tape him to the toilet.

01:24:46.753 --> 01:24:49.339

01:25:03.854 --> 01:25:05.856

01:25:07.858 --> 01:25:10.235
An escape convict?
What are you thinking?

01:25:10.611 --> 01:25:12.196
He saved my life.
-What was in for?

01:25:12.196 --> 01:25:14.656
Murder, rape and

01:25:14.656 --> 01:25:16.909

-Oh, my God, April.

01:25:24.249 --> 01:25:26.251
Listen, I didn't know,
who I can trust.

01:25:26.668 --> 01:25:30.005
Does Karl know?
-Yeah.

01:25:30.297 --> 01:25:32.299
You know,

01:25:32.758 --> 01:25:35.761
We have no else to go.

01:25:36.136 --> 01:25:38.639
What would you do
without me?

01:25:48.941 --> 01:25:51.026
Sheriff is here.
-What?

01:25:51.235 --> 01:25:53.278
He must know you are
here. -How he could know

01:25:53.445 --> 01:25:54.988
even we don't know to until
this morning. -Doesn't matter.

01:25:54.988 --> 01:25:58.659
Just go and hide on the back.
Go, go. I'll take care of this.

01:26:05.958 --> 01:26:09.002
No, he will see you.
Get in the closet.

01:26:09.711 --> 01:26:12.589
No, no. It's safe.
Come on.

01:26:16.301 --> 01:26:20.055
How he can know I'm here?
-Maybe too much from here.

01:26:33.527 --> 01:26:36.822
I don't hear anything.
-They probably at the front door.

01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:38.115

How well do you know him?
-He handles my insurance for me.

01:26:51.837 --> 01:26:53.922

What's taken so long.
-Don't worry.

01:27:10.898 --> 01:27:15.819
I know she's not gonna turn us on, but
she's needs the guys fall all over her.

01:27:24.661 --> 01:27:28.540
I mean, I don't wanna
go back to prison.

01:27:30.209 --> 01:27:34.505

When is the last time

01:27:55.442 --> 01:27:58.445
Yesterday, day before? I can't

01:28:01.698 --> 01:28:04.576

01:28:05.536 --> 01:28:08.956

01:28:09.164 --> 01:28:13.001
Wish to try piece that together.
-Do you know who did it?

01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:18.340
You know Karl Dumas?
-Karl Dumas. Yes, I do.

01:28:18.382 --> 01:28:21.385
Did he killed Martin?

01:28:36.441 --> 01:28:38.402
OK.

01:28:46.159 --> 01:28:49.580
Wait.
-What?

01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:00.424
Wait a minute.

01:29:00.424 --> 01:29:04.761
That one was from
the blackmail pictures.

01:29:23.113 --> 01:29:25.490
You need to see this.

01:29:43.884 --> 01:29:47.888
You not get that? -No, no.
Just let the machine pick it up.

01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:50.682
And to answer your question,
no, I haven't heard from my sister for

01:29:51.016 --> 01:29:53.936
I don't know, a couple
of weeks. She's OK?

01:29:53.977 --> 01:29:57.814
We haven't even locate her.
-Oh, my gosh Sheriff.

01:33:23.061 --> 01:33:25.898
Oh, man.

01:33:42.998 --> 01:33:47.169
April...
-Don't even.

01:33:49.171 --> 01:33:52.591
For the Christ sake, April,
I slept with all your boyfriends.

01:33:52.674 --> 01:33:56.970
Billy, Hall, Cody. All of them.
It's about time you knew.

01:34:27.626 --> 01:34:31.588
You know, I can't seems
surprised Martin end up dead.

01:34:31.964 --> 01:34:35.634
He was a greedy bastard. He paid
well. I was make 750 a week

01:34:36.134 --> 01:34:40.889
to make those photos. It was a
lot more I could make with cocktails.

01:34:41.223 --> 01:34:43.892
But your own sister? -Hey,
I didn't know she's gonna be there,

01:34:44.351 --> 01:34:45.853
to until I carried
her from the van.

01:34:46.311 --> 01:34:49.189
What was I gonna do?
Wasn't like actually did

01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:53.485
anything to them anyways,
just posed them for a photo.

01:34:53.610 --> 01:34:56.613
You know, he was making
a 10.000 $ a month.

01:34:57.114 --> 01:35:02.452
52 women in 17 states,
gives him money, every month.

01:35:02.452 --> 01:35:06.164
I can't even imagine
what you must think of me.

01:35:06.248 --> 01:35:09.209
Can't be that hard.

01:35:22.139 --> 01:35:27.311
If we want the cops thinks is me,
we have to take his clothes off.

01:35:27.311 --> 01:35:30.898
I don't want to touch him.
-Me neither.

01:35:31.023 --> 01:35:35.527
But you both been with him.
-That's one he was alive.

01:35:37.237 --> 01:35:41.450
Look, he can't be in his cloth.
So, that way won't gonna work.

01:35:40.699 --> 01:35:43.076
You figured out,

01:35:43.118 --> 01:35:45.662
I'm not the one
who shot him.

01:35:50.292 --> 01:35:56.089
You own me.
-Shit. Fine.

01:36:33.168 --> 01:36:35.671
Sorry, Karl.

01:36:36.004 --> 01:36:38.799
Never expected our
marriage end like this.

01:36:39.174 --> 01:36:41.385
You know honey,
he didn't deserve you.

01:36:41.385 --> 01:36:44.680
None of the men you ever
been deserved you.

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:46.640
You better than all of them,

01:36:46.807 --> 01:36:49.935
unfortunately I wasn't.

01:36:51.436 --> 01:36:53.397
Will, you drive.

01:36:53.397 --> 01:36:56.441
I'm really feel
I can't now. -OK.

01:36:56.441 --> 01:37:00.028
We still get Karl's
car to Canada.

01:37:13.125 --> 01:37:15.460
April,

01:37:15.794 --> 01:37:18.714
will I ever see you again.

01:37:19.673 --> 01:37:21.508
You know, if you
haven't been who you are

01:37:21.508 --> 01:37:23.760
I wouldn't been
where I'm now.

01:37:24.469 --> 01:37:28.432
That's a lot better
then where I was.

01:38:14.186 --> 01:38:16.563
911, emergency.

01:38:16.730 --> 01:38:19.900
Is this a police?
-Yes, can I help you.

01:38:20.108 --> 01:38:22.694
Mam. Mam.

01:38:34.331 --> 01:38:38.293
That's when he broke in.
Right after you left.

01:38:38.377 --> 01:38:41.880
He must to be
hiding in the garage.

01:38:42.339 --> 01:38:47.135
He attacked me in the house first
and then make me drive out there.

01:38:48.387 --> 01:38:53.141
He had my gun and
he it pointed to my head.

01:38:53.141 --> 01:38:55.811
Then he attack me again

01:38:55.894 --> 01:39:00.399
but then I grabbed his hand...

01:39:00.524 --> 01:39:04.027
The gun went off
but he still try to run me down

01:39:04.319 --> 01:39:07.823
and then he saw the car
go over and...

01:39:08.824 --> 01:39:12.786
It's OK. Take it
easy Mrs. Beller.

01:39:12.911 --> 01:39:15.330
We just need it to
make an identification.

01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:19.459
Is this the man on the
bottom of the cliff? -God.

01:39:20.002 --> 01:39:22.421
That's him.

01:39:52.743 --> 01:39:55.120
One thing still worries me.

01:39:55.579 --> 01:39:58.624
Two cars go over
the same cliff.

01:39:58.999 --> 01:40:01.168
We should be pick up
different place.

01:40:01.335 --> 01:40:03.837
Cops aren't stupid,
you know.

01:40:31.615 --> 01:40:35.077
Two cars of the same cliff.

01:40:35.077 --> 01:40:37.371
What of the chance is.

01:40:37.746 --> 01:40:40.874
I was thinking
the same thing.

01:40:41.416 --> 01:40:46.922
Way the guy escaped,
I'm get to think that was planned to.

01:40:47.214 --> 01:40:51.552
Yeah, there it is stupid a way
smarter they were given a credit for.

01:40:52.052 --> 01:40:54.763
Sheriff, we just get call
from the highway patrol.

01:40:54.763 --> 01:40:57.432
They found Karl's Dumas
mustang parked off the highway

01:40:57.683 --> 01:40:59.685
about the quarter mile
from the Canadian border.

01:40:59.852 --> 01:41:01.854
They catch him?
-No. Just a car.

01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:03.730
Pretty sure he walked
into the Canada.

01:41:04.106 --> 01:41:07.442
We are on the phone now.
-Thank you. -Sure.

01:41:12.698 --> 01:41:15.951
Well,

01:41:15.951 --> 01:41:18.745
is all starting to make sense.

01:41:19.037 --> 01:41:24.001
Photographs, missing wife,
dead lover,

01:41:24.001 --> 01:41:27.254
convicted man.

01:41:29.381 --> 01:41:33.468
Didn't take a genius
to figure this one out.

01:41:33.468 --> 01:41:36.346
Will and Carl,
run this together.

01:41:43.604 --> 01:41:45.230
You know,

01:41:45.522 --> 01:41:49.735
if they think we are dead,
we don't have to go to Mexico.

01:41:50.569 --> 01:41:53.822
So, where do you wanna go?

01:41:53.989 --> 01:41:58.493
I will know,
when we get there.
