Just one more time.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.414
Dad, please?

01:07.458 --> 01:08.851
Oh, my God.

Hey, they having a bulk sale
at Suits 'R' Us?

01:37.314 --> 01:39.099
As a matter of fact, yeah.
Pretty snazzy, right?

01:39.142 --> 01:40.622
Yeah, if it's your
First Communion.

01:40.665 --> 01:43.059
Or if you're
picking up the keys

01:43.103 --> 01:45.322
to the sweet new house
you just bought.

01:45.366 --> 01:46.802
Are you serious?
Yeah.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.804
Realtor said it was gonna be
a great investment.

01:48.847 --> 01:51.633
What are your
contingencies?

01:51.676 --> 01:54.244
How long's escrow?
Have you seen any comps?

01:54.288 --> 01:56.290
Uh, no contingencies,
escrow closed this morning,

01:56.333 --> 01:58.422
and I don't know what
that third thing was.

01:58.466 --> 02:01.033
What the hell, Sebastian?
Why didn't you tell me?

02:01.077 --> 02:02.339
Because I figured
you'd react the way

02:02.383 --> 02:03.514
that you're reacting
right now,

02:03.558 --> 02:04.994
like I'm being impulsive.

02:05.037 --> 02:07.605
First smart thing
you've said.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.436
HANNAH:
Good morning. Dr. Wade.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.351
Black coffee,

02:14.395 --> 02:16.788
a touch of chicory.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.050
You know my poison?

02:18.094 --> 02:19.443
I do my research.Thank you.

02:19.487 --> 02:21.837
You don't take coffee, Lasalle.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.186
Who am I looking at?

02:23.230 --> 02:25.841
Lieutenant Commander
Spencer Morrison.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.321
No wallet, no phone.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.366
NOPD I.D.'ed him
off his fingerprints.

02:29.410 --> 02:30.628
WADE:
Abrasions and contusions

02:30.672 --> 02:32.935
suggest a struggle.

02:32.978 --> 02:35.720
HANNAH: Burst capillaries,
bruising around the neck.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.940
Strangulation?My initial thought
as well.

02:37.983 --> 02:43.032
But I've never seen a
strangulation pattern like that.

02:43.075 --> 02:45.034
A small cluster of bruising
around the neck.

02:45.077 --> 02:46.644
Very interesting.Hey there.

02:46.688 --> 02:48.429
First official crime scene
as the boss.

02:48.472 --> 02:49.821
How's it going?

02:49.865 --> 02:52.433
She brought me coffee.Ah.

02:52.476 --> 02:55.218
Iced for you two.Never say no
to an ice-cold bribe.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.568
Not that you have to
bribe us or anything, you know.

02:57.612 --> 02:58.743
Unless you're secretly horrible.

02:58.787 --> 03:00.832
Which...
clearly you're not.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.834
Thank you, Sebastian.

03:02.878 --> 03:05.402
What do we know about
Commander Morrison?

03:05.446 --> 03:07.665
Member of a diplomatic corps.
Foreign affairs officer.

03:07.709 --> 03:10.364
Specialized in the Middle East.
Billeted out of D.C.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.496
He was probably here for the
Middle Eastern trade conference.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.977
That's right.
Morrison's C.O. said

03:15.020 --> 03:16.848
he was sent last minute
to attend a conference mixer

03:16.892 --> 03:17.980
yesterday evening.

03:18.023 --> 03:19.503
Conference started at 8:00 p.m.

03:19.547 --> 03:22.114
By 8:40, witnesses reported
Morrison coming through here

03:22.158 --> 03:23.290
running for his life.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.552
Anybody see what
he was running from?

03:24.595 --> 03:25.596
No, but there are
surveillance cameras

03:25.640 --> 03:26.641
all over the park.

03:26.684 --> 03:27.859
Already pulling the footage.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.339
If someone was
following Morrison,

03:29.383 --> 03:30.819
they could have come here
from the conference.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.255
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, Gregorio
and I can head over there,

03:32.299 --> 03:33.648
start asking some questions.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.476
Let's make it the three of us.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.347
I've had my share of
interactions with diplomats.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.131
It's always a delicate dance.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.441
Big shoes to fill,

03:44.485 --> 03:48.010
but it seems like Hannah's
holding her own all right.

03:48.053 --> 03:51.535
I think Pride would approve.

03:51.579 --> 03:54.756
Hope his first day as the big
boss is going just as smooth.

03:54.799 --> 03:56.540
Mmm.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.894
[soul music playing
over car stereo]

04:22.087 --> 04:25.526
Special Agent in Charge.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.397
Did you have any trouble
finding your way?

04:27.441 --> 04:28.616
Uh, not used to coming
all this way

04:28.659 --> 04:30.008
into the castle,
but I made it.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.575
Steven Thompson,
your ASAC.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.011
Heard a lot about you
over the years.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.709
Good things, I hope.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.711
Well, stories, anyway.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.321
D.C. wanted more
field experience,

04:38.365 --> 04:40.280
that's what they got.

04:42.847 --> 04:45.502
Still recovering from your
injuries

04:45.546 --> 04:48.070
Slowly and painfully.

04:48.113 --> 04:50.507
This should be a welcome
change of pace. This way.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.857
We're already five minutes late
for your meeting with JAG.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.337
Huh?

04:54.381 --> 04:56.557
I thought I was early.

04:56.600 --> 04:57.732
At Southeast early
means 30 behind.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.257
Agent McGill used to arrive
by 5:30.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.780
He liked to get a head start.Uh-huh.

05:02.824 --> 05:06.436
Not sure I can promise to
continue that routine, but...

05:06.480 --> 05:08.177
SCIF facilities
are this way,

05:08.220 --> 05:10.440
chief of staff
office is here.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.573
C.O. is out of town; you'll
meet her when she's back.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.836
A dozen other hands
to shake, but no time.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.446
Special Agent Pride.Uh, yes.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.709
I'm Ginny Young, your assistant.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.450
Oh, well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Ginny.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.452
Pleasure's all mine.
I got a stack of to-dos

05:22.496 --> 05:24.062
and phone calls
for you to return.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.847
And these are the open case
files for your meeting with JAG.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.850
This meeting.
That I'm heading into now.

05:30.765 --> 05:31.853
Yes. Anything wrong?

05:31.896 --> 05:34.421
Uh...

05:34.464 --> 05:36.945
No. I just, I'm used to
reading up ahead of time.

05:36.988 --> 05:39.643
This is more of a read-as-you-go
kind of deal.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.567
SEBASTIAN: Well, whoever was
at the mixer last night

05:50.611 --> 05:51.873
is at this breakfast right now.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.440
So all we
got to do is see

05:53.483 --> 05:55.442
if anyone knows Morrison.
That's easy enough.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.792
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, if you're fluent
in 20 different languages.

05:57.835 --> 06:00.272
And if the diplomats don't claim
immunity and clam up.

06:00.316 --> 06:01.709
It's best to keep it
friendly and casual.

06:01.752 --> 06:03.058
I'll tackle the Middle
Eastern languages,

06:03.101 --> 06:04.407
then move to Asia
and Europe.

06:04.451 --> 06:05.974
Well, I'm-- how many languages
do you speak?

06:06.017 --> 06:07.541
Fluently, six. Yeah.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.586
Big disappointment
to the parents.Oh.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.719
But, I'm conversational
in about 15.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.547
It's easy when
your mother's a linguist.

06:13.590 --> 06:14.635
All right, well,
I'll take Russian

06:14.678 --> 06:16.593
off your plate.Great.

06:16.637 --> 06:19.509
Yeah, and I got high school
Spanish on lockdown...Yeah.

06:19.553 --> 06:20.510
...so, tengo hombre.

06:20.554 --> 06:21.555
Okay, buena suerte.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.513
Yeah. What?

06:29.954 --> 06:32.696
JAG 1: Case number 147503.
Stolen medical supplies.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.611
Items have been recovered
unharmed.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.874
Case is being shelved for now.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.572
Okay, how many arrests?None.

06:38.615 --> 06:41.618
Well, then the case
isn't closed.

06:41.662 --> 06:42.663
I'm looking over the file,

06:42.706 --> 06:44.795
and a couple
witness statements

06:44.839 --> 06:46.623
seem fishy-- the orderly who
called in the theft...

06:46.667 --> 06:48.103
THOMPSON:
What the SAC is saying

06:48.146 --> 06:50.888
is keep the investigation open
until arrests are made.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.368
Well, that wasn't exactly

06:52.412 --> 06:54.762
what I was saying, but...Let's sidebar.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.590
Okay.Next.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.418
JAG 2:
Case 15877.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.942
Petty Officer
Carmine, Jonathan.

07:00.985 --> 07:03.640
UA out of Pensacola
going on three weeks.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.903
Investigating agent thinks
he took an unscheduled vacation.

07:05.947 --> 07:10.473
I-I see that, but he
didn't pack a bag.

07:11.779 --> 07:12.867
So I-I'm wondering if maybe
we should...

07:12.910 --> 07:16.653
:
Uh, respectfully.
Yes.

07:16.697 --> 07:19.613
I know fieldwork's
second nature, but, uh,

07:19.656 --> 07:22.267
we've got 37 of these
to get through.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.757
Oh. Excuse me.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.719
Carry on.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.550
Loretta.Well,

07:43.593 --> 07:44.812
I guess old habits do die hard.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.509
I meant to call Hannah.

07:46.553 --> 07:49.730
You're not the only one
struggling with transitions.

07:49.773 --> 07:50.861
First day blues?

07:50.905 --> 07:52.167
First day frustration.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.821
No one will let me do anything.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.823
Oh, perhaps you're trying
to do too much.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.389
You took the job for a reason.

07:57.433 --> 08:00.175
Just slow down, focus on health.

08:00.218 --> 08:03.439
You should give it more than
an hour and a half.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.049
Doctor's orders.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.399
Yeah.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.880
Before you go,
what do you got?

08:09.924 --> 08:13.188
Don't you think that should be
Hannah's concern?

08:13.231 --> 08:15.930
Uh... maybe, but...

08:15.973 --> 08:18.280
I'm invoking
SAC's privilege. Spill.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.894
Foreign affairs officer
asphyxiated

08:23.938 --> 08:25.592
in the Carousel Gardens.

08:25.635 --> 08:27.550
Looks like a sharp strike
forced his trachea

08:27.594 --> 08:29.770
into his airways.

08:29.813 --> 08:32.076
PRIDE: Close combat blow.
Trained killer.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.643
You might have a professional
hit on your hands.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.602
THOMPSON:
Special Agent Pride.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.300
That's my babysitter. Gotta go.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.086
We're reconvening
with JAG tomorrow.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.914
Budget meeting just got
pushed up, too.

08:43.958 --> 08:47.004
You might get lucky and have
a few minutes for lunch.Huh.

08:47.048 --> 08:50.007
That does sound lucky.

08:52.227 --> 08:55.099
Uh, okay. Let's try this again.

08:55.143 --> 08:58.450
Um, cocktail mixer,
uh, last night.

08:58.494 --> 09:02.890
Ah, coffee,
with cream and sugar.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.675
Oh, no. I'm not a,
I'm not a waiter.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.677
Um, I'm actually,
I'm an investigator.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.113
And I'm trying-- do you
think that the suit

09:09.157 --> 09:10.419
makes me look like
I'm on the staff?

09:10.462 --> 09:11.594
'Cause, obviously,
that's not something

09:11.638 --> 09:13.074
that I want to--
you're right.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.206
Let's

09:15.250 --> 09:16.817
Man.

09:17.948 --> 09:20.690
You don't understand Klingon,
do you?

09:20.734 --> 09:24.738
She probably doesn't but
I know a few key phrases.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.922
Okay. What-Whatever that was
was not Klingon.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.446
Well, you're quite the
detective, aren't you?Yeah, kind of.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.535
Well, I'm sort of like, um,
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.102
You know? But armed.

09:41.145 --> 09:42.756
Bow tie would really
bring that look home.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.453
Yes. Yeah.

09:46.498 --> 09:47.804
Sebastian...

09:47.848 --> 09:48.936
Hmm?
...is my name.

09:48.979 --> 09:50.807
My name is Sebastian.
That's me. Hi.

09:50.851 --> 09:53.549
I'm your saving grace,
Carmen Delahoy,

09:53.593 --> 09:54.811
diplomatic translator,

09:54.855 --> 09:57.466
United Nations
Trade Association.

09:57.509 --> 09:58.815
That is an
incredibly long title.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.556
Very impressive.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.340
Um, do you mind,
actually, can you ask her,

10:02.384 --> 10:03.733
um, if she's seen this man

10:03.777 --> 10:04.995
last night?

10:05.039 --> 10:06.649
I-I wasn't done.

10:06.693 --> 10:09.173
This guy-- I knew it.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.218
He's CIA or something,
isn't he?

10:10.261 --> 10:12.220
What? No.
Did

10:12.263 --> 10:13.874
Yeah. Last night.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.484
He was acting a bit dodgy.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.442
It looked like he was following
one of the diplomats.

10:17.486 --> 10:20.010
I thought maybe it was like
a-a covert meetup

10:20.054 --> 10:22.273
or a dead drop or something.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.886
I like spy movies.

10:25.929 --> 10:29.019
No. Trust me,
I-I love spy movies, but, um,

10:29.063 --> 10:31.282
I think I'm gonna need
a little more information.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.849
Am I a witness?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.654
Where is he going?

10:54.697 --> 10:56.220
I'm afraid he has
a speech to give

10:56.264 --> 10:59.876
to 50 of the most important
economists in the Middle East.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.312
Your Arabic is excellent,
by the way.

11:01.356 --> 11:03.880
Oh, shukraan.It's a
beautiful language.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.839
Is there anything
I can help you with?

11:05.882 --> 11:08.711
In fact, there is one more
member of your delegation

11:08.755 --> 11:10.060
I do need to speak with.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.280
Mikael Basara?

11:12.323 --> 11:13.934
Bank executive.

11:13.977 --> 11:16.850
Mikael was
at the mixer last night,

11:16.893 --> 11:19.591
but I haven't
seen him since.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.943
Maybe too many music clubs

11:22.986 --> 11:24.640
The city is seductive.
Mm-hmm.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.816
New Orleans, after all.

11:33.257 --> 11:34.998
:
Nobody will admit

11:35.042 --> 11:36.521
they knew or saw
Commander Morrison.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.219
Isn't the whole point
of diplomatic relations

11:38.262 --> 11:41.004
to communicate?
There is one
missing UAE member.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.963
Mikael Basara.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.399
Get the feeling
he's our answer,

11:44.442 --> 11:46.967
especially since
his delegation claims

11:47.010 --> 11:48.533
they don't know
where he is.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.013
"Claims"?
Mm-hmm.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.407
Well, I may not speak
Arabic or Russian,

11:52.450 --> 11:53.756
but I do speak people.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.237
I got a hot lead.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.021
HANNAH:
Oh, who's that?

11:58.065 --> 11:59.719
It's Carmen.

12:00.981 --> 12:03.505
Does this hot lead
have a last name?

12:03.548 --> 12:04.811
What?

12:04.854 --> 12:06.116
Uh, yeah, yeah.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.249
Delahoy. Carmen Delahoy.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.904
Hmm, and what did this
Carmen Delahoy see?

12:10.947 --> 12:13.341
I have no idea. She got
pulled back into work,

12:13.384 --> 12:15.517
but we're gonna meet here
later for drinks.

12:15.560 --> 12:18.085
Oh. Is this a witness
interview or a date?

12:18.128 --> 12:19.913
It's an interview. It's
definitely an interview.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.871
Why? Do you think
she's vibing me?

12:23.133 --> 12:24.265
Well, I don't care
how we get our answers,

12:24.308 --> 12:25.832
as long as we get them.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.790
Sebastian, go have
those drinks.
Okay.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.140
We will focus on Mikael Basara.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.881
Bye.
Bye.

12:39.149 --> 12:42.936
Mikael Basara checked into
the hotel two nights ago.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.024
He went to every
conference event

12:44.067 --> 12:46.069
until 19 hours ago

12:46.113 --> 12:48.593
when he slipped off
the face of the earth.Not a coincidence.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.247
He's got to be involved
in Morrison's murder.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.684
Yeah, why would
a foreign bank executive

12:52.728 --> 12:54.251
kill a Navy diplomat?

12:54.295 --> 12:56.863
Because Morrison was more
than just a diplomat.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.953
You get read in on some sort of
secret file on our commander?

12:59.996 --> 13:01.868
The opposite. I was
completely stonewalled.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.131
I was assured Morrison
was there as an observer.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.176
An observer
no one knows or saw.

13:06.220 --> 13:07.525
Yeah, which is
why I'm gonna

13:07.569 --> 13:09.832
call in some favors from
my contacts at CIA, DIA...

13:09.876 --> 13:12.139
PRIDE: Save those favors
for another case.

13:12.182 --> 13:15.969
Morrison's murder didn't
add up to me either,

13:16.012 --> 13:19.233
so I made a few of my own
phone calls, got some answers.

13:19.276 --> 13:21.713
New job comes with perks.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.891
Not trying to overstep.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.893
No. We'll take all the help
we can get.

13:26.936 --> 13:29.025
Okay. Good.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.332
So...

13:33.551 --> 13:35.162
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.685
No. I'm sorry.
No.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.034
HANNAH: No.PRIDE: It's...

13:40.863 --> 13:41.951
Please.

13:46.216 --> 13:50.525
Commander Morrison
was not a diplomat.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.092
He was a covert naval
intelligence officer

13:52.135 --> 13:54.050
on assignment.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.878
What kind of assignment would
bring him to New Orleans?

13:55.922 --> 13:57.227
The Khalifa Brief.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.751
Stuff dreams are made of.

13:59.795 --> 14:02.145
What's the Khalifa Brief?

14:02.189 --> 14:03.233
PRIDE:
A document outlining

14:03.277 --> 14:04.495
a massive international

14:04.539 --> 14:06.106
money-laundering scheme.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.195
HANNAH:
Rebels, warlords,

14:08.238 --> 14:11.328
arms dealers, all running
blood money into one Dubai bank.

14:11.372 --> 14:14.114
It's like the yellow pages
of the world's most wanted.

14:14.157 --> 14:17.204
Morrison was sent here
to make contact with a source

14:17.247 --> 14:19.119
trying to sell the brief.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.425
I'm guessing Mikael Basara.

14:21.469 --> 14:23.166
Deal could've gone south.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.733
Basara kills Morrison
and escapes in the night.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.909
Right theory,
wrong suspect.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.129
I've been looking
through video footage

14:29.172 --> 14:30.347
from last night's crime scene.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.784
Take a look at what I found.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.788
HANNAH:
Black hoodie.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.442
Trailing Morrison.

14:38.486 --> 14:39.879
And he follows Morrison,
takes all his stuff.

14:39.922 --> 14:40.923
Got to be our guy.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.186
PATTON:
Our gal, actually.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.540
I've been running
facial recognition.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.151
HANNAH:
That won't be necessary.

14:51.194 --> 14:54.458
We know who she is
and where she is.

14:59.594 --> 15:03.250

15:37.980 --> 15:39.329
Yeah, you know,
when you say it like that,

15:39.373 --> 15:40.374
sounds like a terrible idea.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.636
No, I was gonna say it sounds

15:41.679 --> 15:43.029
like a very mature idea.

15:43.072 --> 15:45.031
Can barely keep track
of my flat keys.

15:45.074 --> 15:47.468
Oh, my God, right?

15:47.511 --> 15:48.948
That's why I got
one of these.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.993
This is a, um...Is that Gigantosaur?

15:51.037 --> 15:54.388

a-a keychain tracker

15:54.431 --> 15:56.651
to help you locate your keys,

The greatest Godzillarip-off

Are you kidding?

15:59.871 --> 16:01.438
I can't... yeah.

16:01.482 --> 16:02.613
I can't believe
that you've seen it.

16:02.657 --> 16:03.832
I thought I was, like,

16:03.875 --> 16:06.182
the only one. Um...

16:06.226 --> 16:08.793
Should probably just bring this
back to the case.

16:08.837 --> 16:11.187
Um, Commander Morrison?

16:11.231 --> 16:13.537
Yeah, I, uh, saw him last night.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.713
He wasn't mingling.

16:15.757 --> 16:17.541
He seemed a bit off.
Huh.

16:17.585 --> 16:20.283
That's probably why I
thought he was a spy.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.285
Oh.
Oh.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.287
Then I might've gotten
a bit carried away.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.594
How

16:26.637 --> 16:28.465
I took a video of him

16:28.509 --> 16:30.206
speaking to some guy.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.643
Weird, right?That's super weird. Yes.

16:32.687 --> 16:34.994
But, honestly,
it could be

16:35.037 --> 16:36.560
incredibly helpful.
Can I see the video?

16:36.604 --> 16:38.475
Totally. It's on my phone.Oh, great.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.651
Oh, except I left
that in the room.

what that is right now.
All you need to know is

17:07.852 --> 17:09.202
Morrison was a spy.

17:09.245 --> 17:10.551
Your girlfriend
probably killed him

17:10.594 --> 17:12.292
so he couldn't get documents

candy in his car.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.406

17:39.449 --> 17:40.842
My gut tells me that

17:40.885 --> 17:42.104
something more is going on.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.323
Your gut also told you

17:43.366 --> 17:44.846
to wear a suit and buy a house.

17:44.889 --> 17:47.718
Maybe it's indigestion.

to you with information

17:49.503 --> 17:51.809
about a murder,
wouldn't you follow it?

17:51.853 --> 17:54.682
If that somebody
was the murderer,

17:54.725 --> 17:57.511
I'd think twice, Sebastian.

17:57.554 --> 18:00.557
All right, well, we both agree

18:00.601 --> 18:02.081
that we need more info,

18:02.124 --> 18:04.692
and our best option is for me
to go up to that room.

18:04.735 --> 18:07.695

What if she's luring him out
to tie up loose ends?

18:45.298 --> 18:47.387
Yeah, except I don't think that
Sebastian's what she's after.

Brief off Morrison's body,

18:50.694 --> 18:52.000
she'd be long gone,
but she's still here.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.349
Yeah, she's probably fishing.

No. No, thanks. I appreciate it.

19:08.756 --> 19:11.062
FBI's got nothing on Basara.

19:11.106 --> 19:13.500
Diplomatic status
makes finding him

19:13.543 --> 19:15.458

Okay, time for
some bright ideas.Yeah.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.953
Exactly.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.522
Yeah, but you
said the FBI...

19:35.565 --> 19:39.395

pull this new job really has.

19:39.439 --> 19:42.181

19:44.052 --> 19:45.140

Yes. Sit.

19:46.794 --> 19:49.710

19:52.060 --> 19:54.410
GREGORIO: No, no, no, don't
drink that, Sebastian.

19:54.454 --> 19:55.585

19:57.326 --> 19:59.546
Oh, here,
let me show you.
Mm.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.114

20:05.987 --> 20:08.555

minute, what?

20:08.598 --> 20:09.817

20:10.992 --> 20:12.036
Dogothy Zbornak, actually.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.429

20:15.823 --> 20:17.651
I'm a huge Golden Girls

20:25.920 --> 20:27.269

20:27.313 --> 20:29.793

20:30.881 --> 20:32.753
SEBASTIAN:
Okay.

20:32.796 --> 20:35.799
So Morrison left the hotel
with some other guy.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.888
Separate cabs.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.847
They were talking
about something.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.414
Did you hear anything?
No.

20:41.457 --> 20:44.852
Really? You were only,
like, six feet away.

20:44.895 --> 20:46.636
No, no. Don't push her too hard.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.986
I mean, you know, if
you happened to catch

20:49.030 --> 20:52.990
a phrase or two.You know what I think?

20:53.034 --> 20:55.558
I think I need
to get out of this dress

20:55.602 --> 20:56.820
and change into something
more comfortable.

20:56.864 --> 20:58.474
That's gonna go well.

20:59.519 --> 21:01.651
You better be careful,
Sebastian.

21:09.093 --> 21:11.792
Tell me you're not doing
what it looks like you're doing.

21:11.835 --> 21:15.012
Running an international trace
for a surveillance operation.

21:15.056 --> 21:16.710
On a foreign
banking executive

21:16.753 --> 21:18.059
with diplomatic
immunity.

21:18.102 --> 21:20.714
Exactly what I didn't
want you to tell me.

21:29.505 --> 21:31.899
This is highly
unusual.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.988
Mikael Basara is a person
of interest in a homicide

21:34.031 --> 21:37.252
who may have valuable intel.
We need to find him.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.603
Yes, of course, by using
the proper channels,

21:40.647 --> 21:42.344
filing requests through
the State Department.

21:42.388 --> 21:43.563
I have.

21:43.606 --> 21:45.304
That takes weeks to approve.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.131
We don't have weeks.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.916
If the UAE finds out
what you're doing,

21:48.959 --> 21:51.353
it could cause an
international incident.

21:51.397 --> 21:54.182
And I'm prepared to take
responsibility if that happens.

21:54.225 --> 21:55.879
AGENT:
Sir.

21:55.923 --> 21:57.228
I have a secure trace.

22:02.016 --> 22:05.193
I know you have a unique
way of running a team,

22:05.236 --> 22:06.847
but this is more than a team.

22:06.890 --> 22:07.978
It's the...

22:08.022 --> 22:10.198
It's the entire
southeast region,

22:10.241 --> 22:13.114
you've made that
abundantly clear.

22:13.157 --> 22:16.030
But for the moment,

22:16.073 --> 22:18.946
I am the special
agent in charge.

22:18.989 --> 22:20.426
So if you'll
excuse me...

22:20.469 --> 22:22.863
Where was Basara

22:22.906 --> 22:24.430
located when he made that call?

22:24.473 --> 22:26.040
AGENT:
In New Orleans, sir.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.563
French Quarter.

22:30.218 --> 22:31.785
He's still
in the hotel.

22:31.828 --> 22:32.916
GREGORIO:
Sebastian, listen to me.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.440
Do not let Carmen
leave that room.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.050
Do you hear me?
I think Pride found

22:36.093 --> 22:38.226
her next target. What do you mean?

22:40.663 --> 22:42.622
Morrison's intercepting

22:42.665 --> 22:45.276
high value intel
from a source, Mikael Basara.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.713
He's in the penthouse right now.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.410
Whatever you do,
keep Carmen where she is.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.456
I'm on my way to secure Basara.

22:50.499 --> 22:53.284
Okay, I won't let her
out of my sight.

22:53.328 --> 22:54.460
Hey, wait!

23:03.817 --> 23:05.775
God, no.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.169
Sebastian, the elevator stopped
and I can't get out.

23:08.212 --> 23:09.997
You need to take Carmen down
and get Basara.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.955
SEBASTIAN: No, she locked me in.
I can't get out.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.479
Find a way out, Sebastian!

23:15.002 --> 23:17.308
It's okay, I got an idea.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.444
I'm gonna scale the balcony.
get to the next floor.

23:22.488 --> 23:23.837
You're gonna do what?!

23:23.880 --> 23:26.100
I totally got this.
What could go wrong?No!

23:26.143 --> 23:28.102
Okay.

23:50.603 --> 23:52.692
Searched every inch
of the hotel.

23:52.735 --> 23:53.954
No sign of Carmen.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.303
She somehow beat us
to Basara,

23:55.346 --> 23:56.870
threw him off a balcony,
and slipped away,

23:56.913 --> 23:58.872
avoiding every
security camera.

23:58.915 --> 24:00.569
Got to assume with
the Khalifa Brief.

24:00.613 --> 24:03.006
How'd she even know
where Basara was?

24:03.050 --> 24:04.355
Patton says she cloned
your phone.

24:04.399 --> 24:06.096
Heard every word you
and Gregorio were saying.

24:06.140 --> 24:09.099
Which is why she invited me up
to her room in the first place.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.318
Man, she played me.

24:10.361 --> 24:12.494
LASALLE:
Botched phone trace,
dead diplomat,

24:12.538 --> 24:14.365
intel out in the open.

24:14.409 --> 24:16.280
King's gonna take
a big hit on this.

24:16.324 --> 24:18.500
Yeah.

24:18.544 --> 24:19.588
It's Hannah.

24:19.632 --> 24:20.850
I'm gonna fill her in.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.508
Sebastian.
No, I know,
you tried to warn me.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.684
Nah, baby, this isn't
an "I told you so."

24:28.728 --> 24:30.817
Drink your tea.
Come on.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.606
Better?

24:38.999 --> 24:42.045
Oh, it's still too hot.

24:42.089 --> 24:44.657
What's going on?

24:44.700 --> 24:48.138
The suit, the house,
the gut calls.

24:48.182 --> 24:49.183
What's up?

24:49.226 --> 24:51.446
I don't know.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.928
I just want to live up
to my potential, you know?

24:54.971 --> 24:56.320
Life's short.

24:56.364 --> 24:57.931
One minute you're collecting
rare action figures,

24:57.974 --> 24:59.106
and the next...

24:59.149 --> 25:00.934
I see. It's Pride.

25:00.977 --> 25:03.284
He nearly dies. It was
a wake-up call for us all.

25:03.327 --> 25:05.547
Except I'm the only one
who bought real estate

25:05.591 --> 25:08.332
and got fooled
by a smart, quirky,

25:08.376 --> 25:10.073
incredibly attractive
assassin.

25:10.117 --> 25:12.859
Yeah, well, happens
to the best of us.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.732
Go home.

25:16.776 --> 25:19.692
Ditch the suit, get some
rest, clear your head.

25:19.735 --> 25:22.782
We won't let Carmen
get away, promise.

25:28.178 --> 25:30.180
PRIDE:
Yes, sir.

25:30.224 --> 25:32.182
Yes, sir.

25:32.226 --> 25:34.054
Yes, sir, I understand.

25:35.142 --> 25:36.317
Yeah.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.710
I will get...

25:40.887 --> 25:44.020
I will get back to you
as soon as I know more.

25:44.064 --> 25:45.544
Thank you.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.024
You all right?

25:48.068 --> 25:51.462
Yesterday was not
my best first day.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.987
Just heard today
might be my last.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.728
I meant
your breathing.

25:55.771 --> 25:58.382
In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

25:58.426 --> 25:59.558
Deep breathing exercises
can help.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.169
How's Sebastian?

26:02.212 --> 26:04.214
He blames himself
for putting you in this spot.

26:04.258 --> 26:07.609
Oh, I put myself in this spot.No.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.219
Sebastian's
in the clear.

26:09.263 --> 26:12.571
HQ just wants my head
on a platter, not his.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.050
Yeah, well, bigger job,
bigger challenges, huh?

26:14.094 --> 26:16.139
I messed up.

26:16.183 --> 26:20.013
I made a judgment
call, got it wrong.

26:20.056 --> 26:22.102
The case isn't over yet.

26:22.145 --> 26:25.105
Okay, your team is working hard
to find Carmen.

26:25.148 --> 26:28.238
Your team now.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.981
Patton thinks he can
reverse the clone

26:32.025 --> 26:34.680
she placed on Sebastian's phone.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.856
We're gonna find her
and the Khalifa Brief.

26:36.899 --> 26:38.553
Oh, I appreciate the support.

26:39.641 --> 26:42.601
But I'm not sure it's gonna be
enough to smooth the waves.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.559
End of day, all D.C.
cares about are results.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.169
You deliver
the Khalifa Brief,

26:46.213 --> 26:47.518
all is forgiven.

26:51.218 --> 26:52.915
Patton found Carmen.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.268
It's not good.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.278
CARMEN:
Nice sweats.

27:13.109 --> 27:14.371
Don't.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.592
Can we just...?

27:21.770 --> 27:23.467
Sorry it has
to go this way.

27:26.732 --> 27:29.212
She so much as touches him,
I swear I'm gonna kill her.

27:43.574 --> 27:45.446
You played me.

27:45.489 --> 27:47.143
You killed Morrison.
You killed Basara.

27:48.579 --> 27:52.061
Now you're
under arrest.Oh, shut up already.

27:57.153 --> 28:01.244
Now, listen very carefully
to what I'm about to say.

28:02.550 --> 28:03.682
That's the house.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.168
Guys.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.517
Guys, it's okay,
don't shoot.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.389
She's British
intelligence.

28:16.172 --> 28:18.087
She's on our side.

28:32.972 --> 28:35.191
A little overkill,
don't you think?

28:35.235 --> 28:38.020
Special Agent Lund might believe
your story about MI6,

28:38.064 --> 28:40.327
but I'm not
convinced.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.851
British intelligence
claims no knowledge of you.

28:42.895 --> 28:46.028
Well, that's why they call it
Her Majesty's SecretService.

28:46.072 --> 28:49.031
Our allied intelligence agencies
don't usually make a habit

28:49.075 --> 28:51.904
of killing American
naval officers.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.166
I didn't kill Morrison.

28:53.209 --> 28:54.471
I was shadowing him.
Actually, I tried

28:54.515 --> 28:56.256
to save his life, but...

28:56.299 --> 28:57.561
his killer got away.

28:57.605 --> 28:59.259
Your mission was
the Khalifa Brief.

28:59.302 --> 29:00.826
Morrison didn't have it,
so you insinuated yourself

29:00.869 --> 29:02.088
with Special Agent Lund.

29:05.134 --> 29:08.311
Sounds quite cold
when you put it like that.

29:08.355 --> 29:09.922
HANNAH:
How would you put seducing

29:09.965 --> 29:12.881
an NCIS agent
in order to steal intel

29:12.925 --> 29:15.144
and kill Mikael Basara?

29:15.188 --> 29:18.844
Not that you'll believe me, but
I don't havethe Khalifa Brief,

29:18.887 --> 29:21.324
and I didn't kill Basara either.

29:21.368 --> 29:23.065
You were trying
to save him, too?

29:23.109 --> 29:25.241
Well, you're not very good
at it, are you?

29:26.939 --> 29:28.679
CARMEN:
I want to see you do better,

29:28.723 --> 29:30.986
running up three flights
of stairs in a cocktail dress.

29:31.030 --> 29:33.162
Forced eye contact,
modulated breath.

29:33.206 --> 29:35.164
She's like
an Olympic-level liar.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.253
I believe her.

29:37.297 --> 29:40.169
He was beating on your guy--
Basara.

29:40.213 --> 29:41.518
She used you.

29:41.562 --> 29:43.172
Technically, yeah,
but she also turned herself in.

29:43.216 --> 29:44.260
It's got to count
for something.

29:44.304 --> 29:46.523
Sebastian... don't.

29:46.567 --> 29:49.918
Okay? She's a spy. She's
a professional manipulator.

29:49.962 --> 29:55.097
Says the woman who fell for
a manipulative spy... twice.

29:55.141 --> 29:56.359
We're not talking about me.

29:56.403 --> 29:58.187
HANNAH:
Tapped into phones, didn't you?

29:58.231 --> 30:00.973
Yes, I cloned Sebastian's
phone for intel.

30:01.016 --> 30:04.367
Yes, I went up to the room
Basara was hiding in,

30:04.411 --> 30:06.239
but I was too late.Because a masked man

30:06.282 --> 30:08.284
was already there,
fighting with Basara

30:08.328 --> 30:09.851
and throwing him
off the edge of a balcony?

30:09.895 --> 30:11.157
I tried
to stop him from escaping.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.941
But he conveniently
got away again.

30:12.985 --> 30:14.377
We are wasting time.

30:14.421 --> 30:16.510
The only reason
I allowed Sebastian

30:16.553 --> 30:19.034
to bring me in is so that
we could work together.

30:19.078 --> 30:20.122
HANNAH:
I see.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.602
Your true suspect is out there

30:21.645 --> 30:23.256
and still has the Khalifa Brief.

30:23.299 --> 30:25.214
We could bring him and
the brief in together.

30:25.258 --> 30:28.000
And why would we do that?

30:28.043 --> 30:31.873
Because I possess treasure.

30:33.353 --> 30:35.834
I found it in
Basara's room.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.662
My guess-- it's the key
to the Khalifa Brief.

30:43.406 --> 30:46.322
You're not seriously
buying this?

30:46.366 --> 30:47.933
This is a very advanced,

30:47.976 --> 30:50.065
highly-encrypted
electronic key.

30:50.109 --> 30:53.112
The kind commonly used for
top secret diplomatic pouches.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.853
SEBASTIAN:
If Basara hid the
Khalifa Brief in a pouch

30:54.896 --> 30:56.419
and this key opens it,

30:56.463 --> 30:58.204
we can use it to lure out
Morrison's killer.

30:58.247 --> 30:59.422
GREGORIO:
What if Carmen isthat killer

30:59.466 --> 31:02.121
and she's playing us again?
Which is likely.

31:02.164 --> 31:03.644
But her story
makes sense, though.

31:03.687 --> 31:05.428
Basara snuck the brief
out of the UAE,

31:05.472 --> 31:07.778
in a pouch, to the States,

31:07.822 --> 31:09.868
waiting to retrieve it so he
could turn it over to Morrison.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.043
HANNAH: She claims
the pouch is stored

31:11.086 --> 31:13.436
at the UAE consulate
for safe keeping.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.916
And if that's true, then
Morrison and Basara's killer

31:14.960 --> 31:16.265
is gonna go there
looking for it.

31:16.309 --> 31:17.658
We need to be there
to catch him.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.486
GREGORIO: So you want
to sneak into the UAE embassy,

31:19.529 --> 31:22.315
where we have no jurisdiction,
to steal sensitive intelligence

31:22.358 --> 31:24.970
out of a pouch we're legally
forbidden to touch?

31:25.013 --> 31:26.362
HANNAH:
With the help of a spy

31:26.406 --> 31:27.886
we have no business trusting.

31:30.627 --> 31:32.891
Anyone got a better idea?

31:35.632 --> 31:39.245
Okay, let's just say
we do this, right?

31:39.288 --> 31:42.161
How do we gain access
in the first place?

31:42.204 --> 31:44.076
SEBASTIAN: Consulate's throwing
a big ball later today.

31:44.119 --> 31:45.860
Carmen's got an invite.
I can be her plus one.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.862
What about the rest of us?HANNAH:
I got a friend at State.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.039
It's a long story,
but kind of owes me his life.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.390
I'll make a call.

32:03.443 --> 32:07.099
I want to thank you for keeping
your trust in me, Sebastian.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.275
Oh, I don't trust you
more than I can throw you,

32:09.318 --> 32:10.885
which, based off our fight
earlier, we both know

32:10.929 --> 32:12.452
is not very far.

32:12.495 --> 32:14.280
So why am I here?

32:14.323 --> 32:15.803
Pretty sure you're not
the murder suspect.

32:15.846 --> 32:19.067
I checked the bruising pattern
around Basara's body.

32:19.111 --> 32:21.504
Unless you secretly have
man hands, you didn't do it.

32:21.548 --> 32:25.465
I appreciate you going
the extra mile for me.

32:25.508 --> 32:26.683
Let's just finish the case.

32:26.727 --> 32:28.250
PRIDE:
All right, Sebastian.

32:28.294 --> 32:32.080
You and Carmen need to head up
to the second floor now.

32:32.124 --> 32:33.690
:
Brief will be secured there.HANNAH: Keep your eyes open.

32:33.734 --> 32:36.258
The killer
will recognize Carmen.

32:36.302 --> 32:38.260
Probably already
on your tail.

32:38.304 --> 32:40.393
Patton, any luck
tracking suspects?

32:40.436 --> 32:43.352
PATTON: Uh, nothing so far,
Pride, but I'm all over it.

32:43.396 --> 32:45.311
I'm scanning the guest list,

32:45.354 --> 32:47.530
cross-referencing anybody
with combat background,

32:47.574 --> 32:48.575
six feet or taller.

32:48.618 --> 32:49.924
It's gonna take a minute.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.752
SEBASTIAN:
The sooner you know,

32:51.795 --> 32:53.406
the better chance we have
of not being beaten to death.

32:53.449 --> 32:54.276
PATTON:
Don't sweat it.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.756
I got your six.

32:55.799 --> 32:58.367
Sebastian, when you find
Basara's diplomatic pouch,

32:58.411 --> 33:00.195
you cannot legally open it.

33:00.239 --> 33:01.327
Carmen is a foreign national.

33:01.370 --> 33:02.328
She'll need to do it.

33:02.371 --> 33:03.590
That way, NCIS is in the clear.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.940
So long as she actually hands
the intel over.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.942
And, Sebastian,

33:07.986 --> 33:10.336
inside the consulate
is sovereign soil.

33:10.379 --> 33:11.815
You've got to draw
Morrison's killer outside

33:11.859 --> 33:13.339
to make the arrest.

33:13.382 --> 33:14.601
PRIDE:
And remember,

33:14.644 --> 33:16.864
the most important part
of this operation.

33:16.907 --> 33:19.388
Stay alive?

33:19.432 --> 33:21.086
Stay quiet.

33:23.175 --> 33:24.524
Diplomats only, upstairs.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.308
Play it cool.

33:31.487 --> 33:33.663
PRIDE: Well, we're gonna need
a distraction.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.448
HANNAH:
No problem.

33:39.365 --> 33:41.454
HANNAH:
Hmm?

33:41.497 --> 33:42.933
Oh...

33:45.327 --> 33:46.720
:
Let's go.

34:03.302 --> 34:04.999
Kiss me.What? I don't think I can...

34:11.788 --> 34:14.269
It's cool, they're gone.

34:14.313 --> 34:16.576
Yeah, it's cool.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.014
Uh, courier room
should be down this way.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.538
We'll slip in,
grab the pouch, and get out.

34:22.582 --> 34:24.801
Here they are.

34:30.198 --> 34:31.852
SEBASTIAN :
Okay...

34:31.895 --> 34:33.506
Guys, it's gonna take us
a little longer

34:33.549 --> 34:34.681
to find what we're looking for.

34:34.724 --> 34:36.291
PATTON:
Heads up, guys. Results just in.

34:36.335 --> 34:37.814
I think I found our suspect.

34:37.858 --> 34:41.383
Aram Nader,
former UAE Special Forces,

34:41.427 --> 34:44.256
trained in close combat,
running for office in the UAE.

34:44.299 --> 34:45.648
I questioned him yesterday.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.433
If he's mentioned
in the Khalifa Brief,

34:47.476 --> 34:49.391
he's gonna go from diplomat
to death row.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.219
End of a political career
and more.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.922
PRIDE:
Sebastian, they're on the move.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.448
Excuse me.

35:05.538 --> 35:06.843
Ah...

35:19.639 --> 35:21.423
Not the first time I hear
the name Pride.

35:21.467 --> 35:22.859
SEBASTIAN:
You know, I'd really love

35:22.903 --> 35:25.253
to be gone by the time
the expert killer gets here.

35:25.297 --> 35:26.994
Yeah, working on it.

35:27.037 --> 35:29.779
You're the man who got
Mikael Basara killed.

35:29.823 --> 35:32.565
It's slightly
more complicated than that.

35:32.608 --> 35:35.307
You authorized
an international phone trace.

35:35.350 --> 35:36.438
Now he is dead.

35:36.482 --> 35:37.961
Am I missing nuance?

35:38.005 --> 35:39.049
I can explain.

35:39.093 --> 35:41.008
By all means.

35:44.707 --> 35:46.579
Got it.

35:50.452 --> 35:51.975
That's it?
That's the Khalifa Brief?

35:52.019 --> 35:53.629
That's the thing that's
gonna bring down dozens

35:53.673 --> 35:54.717
of international
criminal organizations?

35:54.761 --> 35:56.589
What were you expecting?

35:56.632 --> 35:59.157
Something more, uh, 007-y.

36:00.984 --> 36:02.638
Deal's a deal.

36:05.989 --> 36:08.688
Hurry up. We got
to get out of here.Fine.

36:10.907 --> 36:12.822
This is a restricted area.

36:12.866 --> 36:15.651
And you're in violation
of international law.

36:17.087 --> 36:18.611
Okay, I'm gonna hold 'em off
while...

36:32.233 --> 36:33.191
So much for quiet.

36:34.148 --> 36:35.280
Go!

36:36.977 --> 36:39.762
Ambassador Hariri,
you need to leave now.

36:39.806 --> 36:40.763
Is this your doing?

36:40.807 --> 36:42.504
I can explain it all later.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.202
Sebastian, where are you?

36:45.551 --> 36:47.901
In trouble.

36:59.565 --> 37:00.740
What's going on, Sebastian?

37:02.394 --> 37:03.482
I'm a little tied
up right now.

37:03.525 --> 37:06.136
Give me the drive.

37:06.180 --> 37:07.703
You're gonna have
to come and take it.

37:07.747 --> 37:08.878
As you wish.

37:10.837 --> 37:13.187
GREGORIO:
Sebastian? Sebastian.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.233
I'm going in.No, hey. We can't.

37:15.276 --> 37:16.451
Badges don't mean
anything in there.

37:16.495 --> 37:18.192
We go in there, all
hell's gonna break lose.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.324
What do you call this?

37:26.069 --> 37:27.854
LASALLE:
Sebastian

37:27.897 --> 37:29.247
You got to bring Nader to us.

37:29.290 --> 37:31.031
Yeah, that's easier said than...

37:33.729 --> 37:35.470
NADER:
Don't make me lose my patience.

37:44.523 --> 37:45.915
Give me the drive.

37:45.959 --> 37:49.267
Give me the drive
and I'll let you live.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.660
You make a good point.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.445
:
Guys, I'm coming in hot.

37:53.488 --> 37:54.794
LASALLE:
What's that mean?

37:54.837 --> 37:55.838
Here you go.

38:02.889 --> 38:04.717
Federal agents!Hands in the air!

38:04.760 --> 38:06.153
Get 'em up!

38:10.418 --> 38:12.159
You can't arrest me.

38:12.202 --> 38:13.247
Diplomatic immunity.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.379
PRIDE:
Last time I checked,

38:14.422 --> 38:16.598
New Orleans was still
on U.S. soil.

38:16.642 --> 38:18.774
Here, all we need

38:18.818 --> 38:21.386
is Ambassador Hariri's
personal approval.

38:21.429 --> 38:22.909
HANNAH: And considering
that you've murdered two men,

38:22.952 --> 38:24.606
including your own associates,

38:24.650 --> 38:25.955
I think
he'll cooperate.

38:28.567 --> 38:31.439
You're correct,
Special Agent Khoury.

38:32.658 --> 38:34.616
His immunity's revoked.

38:34.660 --> 38:35.835
Cuff him.

38:35.878 --> 38:37.315
GREGORIO: Easy, baby.SEBASTIAN: Yeah, yeah.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.055
You know, I'm fine, I'm fine.
We got to find Carmen.

38:39.099 --> 38:41.362
Where is she?HANNAH: I'm afraid
she's gone, Sebastian.

38:41.406 --> 38:42.450
We lost her in the chaos.

38:42.494 --> 38:45.018
I'm sorry.

38:45.061 --> 38:48.369
:
All right, well,

38:48.413 --> 38:50.589
at least we got
the Khalifa Brief.

38:52.199 --> 38:55.724
We absolutely do not have
the Khalifa Brief.

38:55.768 --> 38:58.771
I've scrubbed this drive
up, down and sideways.

38:58.814 --> 39:01.295
No secret bank files.Are you sure, Patton?

39:01.339 --> 39:04.080
All we have is hundreds of
photos of a dog in a sweater.

39:06.431 --> 39:07.475
Oh.

39:09.129 --> 39:11.610
Did you tell Sebastian yet?

39:11.653 --> 39:14.090
Yeah, he was with me
when I opened the file.

39:14.134 --> 39:16.223
All he said was
"Dogothy Zbornak,"

39:16.266 --> 39:17.616
and he had someplace to be.

39:24.623 --> 39:27.190
Sebastian?

39:27.234 --> 39:28.844
SEBASTIAN:
You got an untraceable phone.

39:28.888 --> 39:30.585
Not surprised
that I got your number?

39:30.629 --> 39:31.847
I know you're good
at what you do.

39:31.891 --> 39:33.806
Well, so are you.

39:33.849 --> 39:36.635
Specifically uh, lying,

39:36.678 --> 39:38.767
deceiving-- what else--
double-crossing.

39:38.811 --> 39:40.508
I'm sorry. I am.

39:40.552 --> 39:42.597
I didn't want it to go this way.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.643
I really do like you.

39:44.686 --> 39:45.905
But my mission was the brief.

39:45.948 --> 39:47.428
Oh, it's cool,
you know, I get it.

39:47.472 --> 39:49.387
All's fair in love
and espionage.

39:51.301 --> 39:54.130
Under different circumstances...

39:54.174 --> 39:56.350
I guess what I'm saying
is maybe

39:56.394 --> 39:57.830
we will meet again.

39:57.873 --> 40:00.093
Yeah, well, why wait?

40:01.747 --> 40:03.749
:
How did you...?

40:05.838 --> 40:09.537
The old Gigantosaur
key chain tracker.

40:10.973 --> 40:12.497
Slipped it in your bag

40:12.540 --> 40:14.890
before we went to the consulate,
just because of all the, uh,

40:14.934 --> 40:16.370
lying and deceiving

40:16.414 --> 40:17.632
and the double-crossing.Double-crossing.

40:17.676 --> 40:19.417
Yeah.
Yeah.

40:20.940 --> 40:24.465
Well, I guess the ball's
in your court now, Sebastian.

40:25.727 --> 40:27.599
What's the move?

40:27.642 --> 40:30.036
THOMPSON: Naval intelligence is reviewing

40:30.079 --> 40:31.341
the Khalifa Brief as we speak.

40:31.385 --> 40:33.779
Intel as valuable as advertised?

40:33.822 --> 40:35.824
D.C. is very pleased.

40:35.868 --> 40:38.914
And I have to admit,
I'm impressed.

40:38.958 --> 40:41.526
You managed to turn utter
catastrophe into total victory.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.441
Oh, I can't take
credit, Thompson.

40:43.484 --> 40:45.399
Special Agent Khoury's team
did the heavy lifting,

40:45.443 --> 40:46.705
especially Agent Lund.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.533
Though he did let
that British agent slip away.

40:48.576 --> 40:50.578
Well, let's just call that
a diplomatic compromise.

40:50.622 --> 40:52.841
Well, whatever you call it,
looks like you made it

40:52.885 --> 40:55.365
to a third day on the job.

40:55.409 --> 40:58.543
Morning, boss.Morning, Ginny.

40:58.586 --> 41:02.590
Let's just see if I can
survive to day four.
