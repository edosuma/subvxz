Hey, what would happen if we put
ketchup in the mustard bottles?

00:40.598 --> 00:42.385
Oh, man. I don't even
want to think about it.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.549
Ah! Dad! They're showing a
commercial for the marathon!

00:45.649 --> 00:48.049
Starting at
11:00 a.m., it's an all-out,

00:48.127 --> 00:49.666
body-slammin',
thank you ma'am-in'

00:49.735 --> 00:52.393
ten straight hours of
Supreme Extreme Champions!

00:52.494 --> 00:54.198
Ten hours is almost not enough.

00:54.276 --> 00:56.231
All of your favorite obstacles
and the ultimate challenge,

00:56.299 --> 00:58.592
- the Stampede!
- The Stampede!

00:58.659 --> 01:00.699
♪♪

01:00.768 --> 01:03.809
Do the steamroller!
Do the steamroller! Yes!

01:03.880 --> 01:05.607
I mean, if you're gonna
get through the Stampede,

01:05.675 --> 01:07.634
- you got to steamroll.
- Obviously.

01:07.714 --> 01:10.654
That spandex doesn't leave
much to the imagination, huh?

01:10.721 --> 01:12.055
No, there's still a little bit

01:12.123 --> 01:14.594
- to imagine.
- Bob's Burgers. This isn't Bob.

01:14.661 --> 01:17.253
Hi, this is Walter Rubens
from the Gold Dragons.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.496
The Gold Dragons? What is that, a gang?

01:19.563 --> 01:21.857
No, it's-it's your daughter
Louise's soccer team.

01:21.924 --> 01:23.513
Louise has a soccer team?

01:23.582 --> 01:25.528
Oh, God, we signed Louise up for soccer.

01:25.595 --> 01:26.801
You what?!

01:26.871 --> 01:28.723
Hey, look, an e-mail from Harley's dad.

01:28.792 --> 01:31.847
He's asking if Louise would want
to join Harley's soccer team.

01:31.916 --> 01:32.927
Think she would?

01:32.996 --> 01:35.005
I've met Louise, so probably not.

01:35.089 --> 01:37.957
Louise, do you want
to sign up for soccer?!

01:38.097 --> 01:41.076
Yes!
Please sign me up for soccer!

01:41.143 --> 01:43.058
- Oh!
- She's being sarcastic.

01:43.136 --> 01:45.052
Are you being sarcastic?!

01:45.121 --> 01:46.872
- No!
- Aw, yeah, you're right.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.308
Well, wait, now I'm not so sure. Louise,

01:49.391 --> 01:51.613
do you want to sign up for soccer?!

01:51.707 --> 01:52.895
Uh-huh!

01:52.962 --> 01:54.043
I guess she wants to do it.

01:54.136 --> 01:55.520
Should we double-triple-check?

01:55.589 --> 01:57.855
No, I-I don't want to yell anymore.

01:58.004 --> 02:00.115
I was being sarcastic.

02:00.182 --> 02:02.120
I'm sorry! It was... I...

02:02.187 --> 02:03.685
- We got a-an e-mail, and I...
- Oh!

02:03.754 --> 02:06.371
Oh, I didn't realize
you got an e-mail!

02:06.440 --> 02:08.699
I completely forgot it happened at all!

02:08.776 --> 02:10.351
It was during wine time!

02:10.418 --> 02:11.826
Guys, guys, shush, shush, shush.

02:11.893 --> 02:13.697
We really need Louise
to play this morning.

02:13.764 --> 02:15.854
Suzy's on vacation and Michaela's sick

02:15.921 --> 02:18.138
- and Jamie's gerbil died.
- Aw!

02:18.205 --> 02:20.296
It was his time. Anyway,
if Louise doesn't come,

02:20.363 --> 02:22.683
we won't have enough players
and we'll have to forfeit.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.839
Oh! - And since it's the
last game of the season

02:24.908 --> 02:26.827
and Louise hasn't come to a single one,

02:26.896 --> 02:29.017
this is literally the least you can do.

02:29.084 --> 02:31.316
Last game? She missed the whole season?

02:31.383 --> 02:34.247
Yes. - Okay. You know
what, Walter, she'll be there.

02:35.776 --> 02:36.806
Louise, come on. Let's get changed.

02:36.873 --> 02:38.222
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.
- Oh, God.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.574
Okay, she went limp. Come
on, we got a rag doll.

02:40.643 --> 02:42.868
- Let's go. Come on, come on.
- No...

02:43.013 --> 02:44.151
Come on!

02:44.218 --> 02:45.500
O!

02:45.567 --> 02:46.724
That was not easy.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.449
I know this seems horrible, Louise,

02:48.516 --> 02:49.996
but you did sign up. Sort of.

02:50.065 --> 02:51.275
No, you signed me up,

02:51.344 --> 02:53.329
and now you're bowing to
grown-up peer pressure!

02:53.427 --> 02:55.882
What's next, taking
fish oil? Paying taxes?

02:55.951 --> 02:59.447
Plus, you might not hate
every single second of it?

02:59.516 --> 03:02.368
Yeah, but what about the Supreme
Extreme Champions marathon?

03:02.435 --> 03:04.015
Without that, what's
the point of anything?

03:04.082 --> 03:06.066
We could DVR it. If we had one.

03:06.133 --> 03:08.285
Should we just push a bunch
of buttons on the remote?

03:08.352 --> 03:09.941
That's how I saw 9 1/2 Weeks.

03:10.010 --> 03:11.894
You'll still get to
see some of the marathon

03:11.963 --> 03:13.547
when you're back,
Louise. A-And, besides,

03:13.615 --> 03:15.671
lots of parents make
their kids play sports.

03:15.738 --> 03:17.480
And for a reason.

03:17.549 --> 03:21.099
- I think. Right, Lin?
- P-Probably! Who can say?

03:21.168 --> 03:22.519
Very convincing.

03:22.588 --> 03:24.142
Come on, Louise, you're going.

03:24.226 --> 03:25.923
All right, I'll go.

03:26.088 --> 03:28.948
Who's driving me to this sucker game?

03:29.015 --> 03:30.482
- Your mother will take you.
- Your dad is gonna take you.

03:30.550 --> 03:31.588
I don't want to go.

03:31.655 --> 03:34.052
- I don't want to go either, Bob.
- Thumb war?

03:34.119 --> 03:36.515
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

03:36.582 --> 03:38.190
- Damn it.
- Yes!

03:38.257 --> 03:40.252
So glad I married a
man with dainty thumbs.

03:40.319 --> 03:42.188
They're beautiful, but they're useless.

03:42.255 --> 03:45.631
Well, Louise, I guess let's
go to your soccer game.

03:45.698 --> 03:47.497
How about I come along?
"Great idea, Tina.

03:47.566 --> 03:49.129
Looks like Tina's coming. Yay!"

03:49.238 --> 03:51.063
And I'll stay here,
'cause it sounds like

03:51.130 --> 03:53.021
where you're going is outside.

03:53.088 --> 03:54.906
Wow, crowded.

03:54.973 --> 03:56.981
Yeah, like "maybe we
won't be able to find

03:57.050 --> 03:58.242
a parking spot" crowded?

03:58.309 --> 04:00.138
Oh, right. If we can't find a spot,

04:00.207 --> 04:01.966
we'd have to go home.
That's not our fault.

04:02.035 --> 04:03.777
- No. Not at all.
- Oh, there's one.

04:03.894 --> 04:05.717
- Ah, wonderful.
- Thanks, Tina.

04:05.784 --> 04:07.278
So, where's Bob today, Lin?

04:07.345 --> 04:09.417
Doctor's appointment? Grocery store?

04:09.816 --> 04:11.067
Did you kick him to the curb?

04:11.136 --> 04:12.497
Anything you need, Linda.

04:12.566 --> 04:13.924
I'm here, I'm not leaving.

04:13.991 --> 04:15.074
You say the word,

04:15.143 --> 04:17.017
- I move my stuff in here.
- Teddy, no. Teddy, Teddy, Teddy!

04:17.086 --> 04:18.769
Bob took Louise to her soccer game,

04:18.839 --> 04:20.488
and Tina went, too, that's all.

04:20.558 --> 04:22.233
Oh, good. What a great dad.

04:22.306 --> 04:25.161
While they're gone, I'm
flying solo with my Gene-o.

04:25.230 --> 04:27.222
Taking a jamma with my mamma.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.091
"Jamma with my mamma"?

04:29.160 --> 04:30.169
Oh, my God.

04:30.238 --> 04:32.091
Gene, is today the day we do the...

04:32.160 --> 04:33.777
- What?
- The piano bar.

04:33.844 --> 04:35.378
The piano bar!

04:35.445 --> 04:37.992
We said we would do it if your dad
ever left us alone again.

04:38.059 --> 04:40.533
- What are you guys talking about?
- Gene and Linda's Piano Bar

04:40.600 --> 04:42.130
Show Tunes and Mouth Foods.

04:42.197 --> 04:43.753

But what'll you wear?

04:57.689 --> 05:00.050
Um, hi. Is this the Gold Dragons?

05:00.119 --> 05:01.931
My daughter is, uh, one of them.

05:01.998 --> 05:04.073
Yes. You must be Bob. I'm Walter.

05:04.140 --> 05:06.569
Here's your jersey. It's
been in my car for nine weeks.

05:06.636 --> 05:08.437
It's listened to a lot of NPR.

05:08.504 --> 05:09.612
N-P-U.

05:09.679 --> 05:11.141
Do you have cleats and shin guards?

05:11.208 --> 05:12.908
Uh, we don't have any of those things.

05:12.975 --> 05:14.615
Of course not.

05:15.111 --> 05:17.886
I guess, uh, books are
sort of shin-guardy.

05:17.953 --> 05:19.528
If you want, you can
borrow my Grishams.

05:19.595 --> 05:21.350
Oh, good. I don't feel like an orphan

05:21.439 --> 05:23.221
who stumbled onto the field at all.

05:23.307 --> 05:25.646
- Why is that guy looking at me so much?
- Brag.

05:25.715 --> 05:27.830
- So, you coaching today?
- Oh, I forgot to tell you,

05:27.897 --> 05:29.894
- you're coaching today.
- Me? Oh-oh, no.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.033
No, definitely not.

05:31.102 --> 05:33.667
Suzy's dad is normally the coach,
but Suzy's on vacation,

05:33.736 --> 05:34.997
so he's on vacation, too.

05:35.064 --> 05:36.331
Classic Suzy's dad.

05:36.398 --> 05:38.451
And you kind of owe it
to us for being M.I.A.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.434
- the whole season.
- W-W-Wait, sorry.

05:40.503 --> 05:42.465
I can't coach. Can anyone else do it?

05:42.600 --> 05:45.702
Maybe someone who's been here
or knows anything about soccer?

05:45.769 --> 05:47.770
- Like you?
- No. I set up the goals.

05:47.839 --> 05:49.934
Plus... Ow. Ow, ow! My hand.

05:50.003 --> 05:51.357
Uh, Bob, hold the clipboard.

05:51.426 --> 05:52.520
- Bob's coaching.
- What?!

05:52.587 --> 05:53.788
Oh, I see you got the clipboard.

05:53.855 --> 05:55.073
- Congrats, Coach.
- Oh, come on.

05:55.141 --> 05:56.376
I don't know how to coach.

05:56.454 --> 05:57.736
Dad...
you might not hate

05:57.804 --> 05:59.220
every single second of it.

05:59.390 --> 06:01.429
Evil child. All right.

06:01.531 --> 06:03.892
- How bad can it be?
- Coach, will you fix my ponytail?

06:03.961 --> 06:04.963
- Uh, I don't know how to...
- Coach,

06:05.031 --> 06:06.158
something went
wrong with my cleats.

06:06.226 --> 06:07.432
- Can you fix them?
- Coach, I can't be goalie.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.815
I can't touch the ball
with my hands.

06:08.883 --> 06:10.407
- Oh, my God.
- Coach, should I live

06:10.476 --> 06:12.372
- with my mom or my dad?
- Help!

06:12.439 --> 06:14.525
Yeah, a little help
over here... look at him.

06:14.594 --> 06:16.351
You're doing great, Dad.

06:19.039 --> 06:20.782
Oh! Why is this happening?

06:20.851 --> 06:22.910
There isn't even anything
written on this clipboard.

06:22.979 --> 06:24.939
Hey, Coach, um,
aren't you gonna get us

06:25.008 --> 06:26.393
to stretch and do drills and stuff?

06:26.461 --> 06:28.721
Right, uh, why don't you guys, um,

06:28.788 --> 06:30.212
kick the ball back and forth.

06:30.279 --> 06:32.137
Wow, you sure you
haven't done this before?

06:32.204 --> 06:34.369
Dad, I'd like to apply for the
position of assistant coach.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.971
You probably have a
lot of offers, but...

06:36.038 --> 06:37.642
Great, you're hired. Here's a clipboard

06:37.711 --> 06:39.126
- with nothing on it.
- Yes.

06:39.195 --> 06:41.373
- Doesn't matter. Leave it.
- Roger that.

06:42.394 --> 06:43.570
Oof.

06:44.078 --> 06:45.597
They look good.

06:45.664 --> 06:47.579
This is gonna be bad.

06:47.648 --> 06:49.453
Whoa. I kinda want their autographs.

06:49.586 --> 06:51.830
Hey, there, I'm Christy,
coach of the Blue Dragons.

06:51.897 --> 06:53.200
- Ow, my hand hurts.
- I know.

06:53.267 --> 06:56.156
Uh, wait, the-the Blue
Dragons? We're the Gold Dragons.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.657
Are all the teams just
different colored dragons?

06:58.726 --> 07:00.650
Yep. Or thunders.
Different colored thunders.

07:00.719 --> 07:03.423
There's a Brown Thunder,
which is... unfortunate.

07:03.492 --> 07:05.689
Yeah. - Look, I just
wanted to wish you good luck.

07:05.766 --> 07:07.604
This is all gonna be
over soon enough.

07:07.672 --> 07:09.032
W-Wait, what?
What does that mean?

07:09.101 --> 07:10.446
You know, I am glad you're here, Louise.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.235
I wondered why you never
came to practices or games,

07:12.303 --> 07:13.808
and I always wanted
to ask you at school,

07:13.876 --> 07:15.272
but honestly I'm scared
of you, and I did not.

07:15.340 --> 07:17.140
But isn't this just the best, though?

07:17.429 --> 07:19.440
Yup. Love soccer.

- Right here.

07:46.890 --> 07:49.041
Ugh, that little jingleberry?

07:49.110 --> 07:51.551
You making fart sounds, or
are you really playing it?

07:51.620 --> 07:52.682
Both.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.576
Not bad. Shove over.

07:56.804 --> 07:57.952
Wow. Yeah!

07:58.019 --> 07:59.679
Whoa, look at you.
Is there a Mr. Merkin?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.216
Oh, the game's starting.

08:02.283 --> 08:05.195
Louise, go that way.
Other girl, go that way.

08:05.264 --> 08:08.149
Guys, you're all standing in a clump
right next to each other.

08:08.218 --> 08:11.039
It's so different from what
the other team is doing.

08:11.156 --> 08:14.742
Come on, play the ball!

08:14.811 --> 08:17.759
- Oh, my God, they scored right away.
- Little slow, Kayla.

08:17.828 --> 08:19.515
Little slow? That was so fast.

08:19.585 --> 08:20.813
Did we start?

08:20.882 --> 08:22.925
That's all right, girls.
Keep hustling!

08:22.992 --> 08:24.524
And have fun out there.

08:24.593 --> 08:26.587
Coach, uh, one thought.
Maybe we should have

08:26.656 --> 08:28.241
someone in goal.
I don't know, just sayin'.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.843
Uh, yeah, yeah. Good idea, Tina.

08:29.910 --> 08:33.389
Hey, someone get in goal. No, just one!

08:36.756 --> 08:38.065

08:38.135 --> 08:39.259
Ooh, how 'bout that show

08:39.326 --> 08:40.982
that's coming to the
community theater...

08:41.049 --> 08:42.360
The Musical?

08:42.429 --> 08:44.730
- Oh, I love the soundtrack.
- Me, too.

08:44.797 --> 08:48.268
TSA's the best musical about a
government agency ever written!

08:48.335 --> 08:51.170
- I-I don't know that one.
- Really? "Female Pat Down"?

08:51.237 --> 08:53.990
"Whose Bag Is This"?
"If You See Something, Sing Something"?

08:54.057 --> 08:56.341
All right! "Female Pat Down."

08:56.408 --> 08:58.177
Let me see if I can remember.

08:59.745 --> 09:01.818
Wow, you're remembering
the crap out of that song.

09:01.885 --> 09:03.543

2-0.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.391
- You guys want a Benadryl?
- What? Why?

09:13.460 --> 09:15.554
'Cause it seems like you're
all allergic to the ball.

09:15.621 --> 09:18.190
Oh, okay. You're, like,
a super cool sports girl

09:18.257 --> 09:20.132
doing trash talk... good job.

09:20.199 --> 09:21.460
I got more where that came from,

09:21.527 --> 09:24.649
Pink Ears Book Legs.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.670
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- You can do it, Mara.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.144
No, no, no, no. Aah!

09:33.211 --> 09:35.804
Oh, good try, Mara... with your face.

09:35.999 --> 09:37.372
Is it... still on?

09:37.448 --> 09:39.515
Yeah, I mean, don't, don't
look at it for a while.

09:39.664 --> 09:40.307
- But it...
- Ow...

09:40.374 --> 09:42.244
You've probably always had
that soccer ball pattern

09:42.312 --> 09:43.157

10:10.014 --> 10:11.892
Aw, why not keep playing this one?

10:11.961 --> 10:12.970
Everyone loves it.

10:13.039 --> 10:14.538
Well, I don't love it, okay?!

10:14.606 --> 10:15.628
I don't love it!

10:15.695 --> 10:17.666
- Whoa.
- Why don't you love it,

10:17.733 --> 10:19.232
- Ms. Merkin?
- I don't want to talk about it.

10:19.299 --> 10:20.461
Well, if she doesn't
want to talk about it...

10:20.528 --> 10:21.759
All right, I'll tell you!

10:21.826 --> 10:24.322
I've been playing piano
for the community theater's

10:24.389 --> 10:25.537
production of TSA.

10:25.604 --> 10:26.755
- What?!
- What?!

10:26.822 --> 10:29.240
But then the damn lead actress

10:29.307 --> 10:31.693
said I was missing cues
and playing off-tempo.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.544
So I quit, and I'm never going back.

10:33.611 --> 10:36.137
No, Ms. Merkin, we're never going back.

10:36.204 --> 10:39.565
Well, it's my Jo... I
don't... Who is... Who is he?

10:40.448 --> 10:42.076
7-0. Close game.

10:42.143 --> 10:43.118
What's your next move, big man?

10:44.159 --> 10:45.516
End of the first quarter.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.689
Okay, so talk to me
about these quarters.

10:47.756 --> 10:49.835
How many more we got? One, zero...

10:49.904 --> 10:51.101
- Three.
- No...

10:51.170 --> 10:52.467
- Yeah.
- Not what I was hoping for.

10:52.535 --> 10:53.625
I know.

10:53.694 --> 10:54.785
Only three more goals

10:54.852 --> 10:56.484
before your team gets shutouted.

10:56.551 --> 10:59.601
Sorry, I don't speak "mean jock girl."
What are you saying?

10:59.670 --> 11:01.334
If the score gets to 10-0,

11:01.475 --> 11:03.350
the game is automatically over,

11:03.417 --> 11:06.013
which is automatically
embarrassing for you.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.765
Wait, like the game would be over over?

11:07.832 --> 11:09.162
Like I could go home?

11:09.229 --> 11:11.724
Yeah, back to the bookstore
that your legs live in.

11:11.791 --> 11:14.367
That's amazing. I mean, oh, no.

11:14.434 --> 11:16.562
Definitely don't want that to happen.

11:16.629 --> 11:18.094
Mm-Kay.

11:18.161 --> 11:20.632
That would be very
disappointing. Thank you.

11:20.826 --> 11:22.544
Hey, you hear about
this shutout rule thing?

11:22.612 --> 11:25.171
Yeah. Three more goals,
and we're on our way back

11:25.238 --> 11:27.093
to Supreme Extreme Champions town.

11:27.162 --> 11:29.227
- That's my favorite town.
- I know.

11:29.361 --> 11:31.843
So I guess we just keep
doing what we're doing?

11:31.910 --> 11:32.908
You got it, Coach.

11:32.975 --> 11:34.727
Let's just be a little
discreet about this?

11:34.794 --> 11:37.117
Me be discreet... You be discreet.

11:38.771 --> 11:40.093
- Yes!
- Yes!

11:40.162 --> 11:42.726
I-I mean, that's all
right. That's all right.

11:42.795 --> 11:45.812
Yeah, we-we'll get
'em. We-We'll get 'em.

11:49.195 --> 11:51.391
Oh no! She stole the ball from me!

11:51.460 --> 11:52.564
Why?!

11:52.633 --> 11:54.306
It's hard to explain, Louise.

11:54.375 --> 11:56.470
Why does anyone steal
the ball from anyone?

11:56.539 --> 11:58.640
Yeah, I just don't
want to lose, you know?

11:58.707 --> 12:00.949
- And go home so soon.
- Hey, Coach.

12:01.016 --> 12:02.978
Really sorry this game
might be over so quickly.

12:03.045 --> 12:05.040
It's just hard to get
my girls to ease up.

12:05.212 --> 12:06.424
It's like telling a shark

12:06.493 --> 12:08.249
not to eat the saddest school of fish.

12:08.316 --> 12:09.824
- That's your team.
- Right.

12:09.891 --> 12:11.459
'Cause if you look at
them, they look really sad.

12:11.526 --> 12:13.087
- Right, right, right, yeah.
- And we're so strong.

12:13.154 --> 12:14.355
Yeah, I know. I got the analogy.

12:14.422 --> 12:15.896
Is there a problem
here? Hey, lady coach,

12:15.963 --> 12:17.191
why don't you go dribble something, huh?

12:17.258 --> 12:18.959
I'm walking away because I want to.

12:19.026 --> 12:21.162
Keep telling yourself that, sweetheart.

12:21.229 --> 12:23.804
I can't believe you
quit TSA: The Musical.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.773
What are you gonna do now,
just teach music to kids? Yuck.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.855
Well, they won't have Matilda
Merkin to kick around anymore.

12:29.922 --> 12:31.840
And their dumb CD player won't complain

12:31.907 --> 12:33.230
if they treat it like crap.

12:33.297 --> 12:35.043
I hope it skips.

12:35.316 --> 12:37.109
They're doing
the show to a recording?

12:37.176 --> 12:39.054
That's Off-Broadway blasphemy.

12:39.121 --> 12:41.822
Yep. And they're gonna
burn in hell for it.

12:41.889 --> 12:43.204
Now, if you'll excuse me,

12:43.273 --> 12:46.587
I'm going to improvise
a sad song.

12:46.694 --> 12:48.995
Um, piano bar manager meeting, Gene?

12:49.157 --> 12:50.813
Did I just get promoted to manager?

12:50.882 --> 12:51.884
I'm not ready.

12:51.953 --> 12:53.907
We got to get Ms.
Merkin back in that show.

12:53.976 --> 12:55.633
Guys, I don't want to
crash your manager meeting,

12:55.701 --> 12:58.553
but I was wondering if I could
just shadow Gene, maybe? Sit in?

12:58.622 --> 12:59.887
- Sure, sure.
- But, Mom,

12:59.956 --> 13:01.408
if we don't get her back in the show,

13:01.476 --> 13:03.167
she can live here with us forever.

13:03.236 --> 13:06.435
Piano bar every day and
all night, I'm assuming.

13:06.504 --> 13:07.628
Great managing, Gene.

13:07.697 --> 13:09.252
For the good of musicals everywhere,

13:09.321 --> 13:10.620
we got to make this right.

13:10.687 --> 13:12.027
Fine.

13:12.094 --> 13:14.432
Uh, excuse me for a second.

13:14.501 --> 13:17.785
Just gonna take the phone
into the kitchen, here, now.

13:17.852 --> 13:20.343
Hey, while you're back there,
any chance I could get a burger?

13:20.410 --> 13:21.605
Oh, yeah, we make food.

13:21.672 --> 13:23.355
Okay, got that out of my system.

13:23.422 --> 13:25.085
Now, who likes Oklahoma!?

13:25.154 --> 13:26.575
Ooh, ooh, me!

13:27.834 --> 13:29.950
Out of my way. -
You got it, K-dog.

13:30.019 --> 13:31.054
Good hustle!

13:31.123 --> 13:32.812
Just have fun out there!

13:32.946 --> 13:34.586
Oh, God, not again.

13:36.918 --> 13:38.021
Yes. I mean...

13:38.090 --> 13:40.180
Oh, darn!

13:40.247 --> 13:41.305
That's 9-0.

13:41.372 --> 13:42.890
Stage is set for a comeback.

13:42.959 --> 13:45.672
- Good hustle!
- Just have fun out there!

13:45.749 --> 13:47.564
I feel like they just
keep saying the same thing

13:47.632 --> 13:48.651
over and over again.

13:48.779 --> 13:50.332
Hey, sideline, switch it up.

13:50.401 --> 13:51.495
Yeah, you, mom jeans.

13:51.562 --> 13:52.734
Shutouted coach says what?

13:52.801 --> 13:54.338
- What?
- Yeah.

13:54.405 --> 13:57.650
Hey, Coach Christy, out of
curiosity, which one's your car?

13:57.717 --> 13:58.870
I'll be right back. Dad,
can I borrow your keys?

13:58.937 --> 14:00.108
Tina, no.

14:00.397 --> 14:01.694
Tina, let go.

14:03.292 --> 14:04.749
What are you doing here?

14:04.816 --> 14:07.357
Some lady called the theater
while we were rehearsing

14:07.424 --> 14:08.841
and said you wanted to come back,

14:08.908 --> 14:10.881
so we came because we want you back.

14:10.948 --> 14:13.384
- It was me, I'm the lady.
- Yeah, you are.

14:13.451 --> 14:14.947
What? I never said that.

14:15.014 --> 14:16.699
Matilda, we can't do
the show without you.

14:16.766 --> 14:18.768
We thought putting the
wig on the CD player

14:18.837 --> 14:21.057
would make it better,
but it just made it worse.

14:21.124 --> 14:23.805
I'm not coming back
unless Sheila apologizes.

14:23.954 --> 14:25.908
And I don't see her here, so...

14:25.996 --> 14:27.670
Oh, I'm here.

14:27.737 --> 14:29.272
But I'm not apologizing.

14:29.339 --> 14:31.007
Oh, my God, I love the theater.

14:31.074 --> 14:33.128
Is the game over?

14:33.197 --> 14:34.378
No, it's just halftime.

14:34.447 --> 14:35.753
So, how long is halftime?

14:35.822 --> 14:38.221
If everyone's feeling good,
can we just skip it, or...

14:38.290 --> 14:39.729
You're running for the Porta Potties.

14:39.797 --> 14:41.611
All right, talk to you when you get out.

14:41.876 --> 14:45.087
Well, better start
packing it in, huh, ladies?

14:45.154 --> 14:47.049
I hate getting shutouted.

14:47.118 --> 14:48.182
Me, too.

14:48.251 --> 14:49.831
I want to play the rest of the game.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.806
What? We're getting killed.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.697
- You want to keep going?
- Well, yeah, it's still fun.

14:54.775 --> 14:56.136
I mean, I don't like
when the ball comes to me,

14:56.204 --> 14:58.183
- but that's so rare.
- Even you, Jodi?

14:58.250 --> 15:00.068
I mean, you look terrified out there.

15:00.135 --> 15:02.198
Mm, I like it. Some people
go on roller coasters,

15:02.265 --> 15:03.910
I sign up for soccer every year.

15:03.977 --> 15:05.507
It makes me feel alive.

15:05.574 --> 15:07.913
I just wish we didn't
get shutouted every game.

15:07.980 --> 15:10.478
W-Wait, you guys get
shutouted every game?

15:10.545 --> 15:12.808
Yeah. I don't even think they
had the rule until this season.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.183
They invented it just for us.

15:14.250 --> 15:15.951
- Halfway through our first game.
- Yeah.

15:16.018 --> 15:18.620
The other name for getting shutouted
is getting Gold Dragon-ed.

15:18.687 --> 15:20.641
Which my dad says is
also something you used to

15:20.710 --> 15:22.711
be able to do in the Philippines
when he was in the Navy,

15:22.779 --> 15:24.024
but I don't know what that means.

15:24.092 --> 15:26.042
It just would've been
nice to score one goal

15:26.111 --> 15:27.385
before the season's over.

15:27.452 --> 15:28.799
Yeah, it would've been, Harley.

15:28.868 --> 15:31.534
Uh, Dad, I can't
believe I'm saying this,

15:31.601 --> 15:33.600
but I don't want to get shutouted.

15:33.669 --> 15:35.496
Really? What about
Supreme Extreme Champions?

15:35.563 --> 15:37.298
And the fact that we both hate this?

15:37.365 --> 15:39.917
Yeah, well, the other
girls want to keep playing,

15:39.986 --> 15:41.802
and I guess it makes me kind of sort of

15:41.869 --> 15:43.404
want to finish the game, too.

15:43.471 --> 15:45.139
Those brave little idiots.

15:45.206 --> 15:46.480
They are brave.

15:46.547 --> 15:48.645
And extremely bad at soccer.

15:48.712 --> 15:51.385
So how do we not get shutouted?

15:51.452 --> 15:52.842
I have no idea.

15:53.811 --> 15:55.429
Second half starts in one minute.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.923
No paper in there, by the way. Anymore.

16:00.345 --> 16:01.657
Thirty seconds coaches.

16:01.726 --> 16:04.478
- All right, Gold, uh, huddle up.
- What do you got, Coach?

16:04.619 --> 16:07.142
Oh, well, I-I feel like,
uh, a lot of the time,

16:07.209 --> 16:09.579
when a team is behind, the-the
coach is supposed to give

16:09.648 --> 16:12.718
a big speech about leaving
it all on the court.

16:12.787 --> 16:14.593
I mean, the-the grass court.

16:14.662 --> 16:16.428
- What-what is this called?
- "Field," Coach.

16:16.496 --> 16:17.587
Really? "Field"?

16:17.656 --> 16:20.165
- What are we, farmers?
- I think it's "field," Coach.

16:20.234 --> 16:22.915
Right, right, field. Yeah, sorry.
Just sounded weird.

16:22.984 --> 16:24.104
Anyway...

16:24.172 --> 16:26.196
Oh, wait! Louise, Mara, uh, come back.

16:26.273 --> 16:28.275
I-I just had a-a
coachy thought.

16:28.397 --> 16:29.806
- Little late, huh?
- Shh.

16:29.875 --> 16:32.245
Mara, you're ready to get
out of the goal, right?

16:32.314 --> 16:33.534
- Yeah.
- Great,

16:33.603 --> 16:35.229
how about this: Mara's forward,

16:35.298 --> 16:37.370
Louise, you be goalie.

16:37.437 --> 16:39.713
And here's the thing,
try and stop the ball

16:39.782 --> 16:42.825
when it goes... come...
go toward you, in the goal.

16:42.892 --> 16:44.444
Oh, God, Dad, no.

16:44.511 --> 16:46.104
It's just, I've seen you use your hands

16:46.173 --> 16:47.972
at the restaurant, and
goalies use their hands,

16:48.040 --> 16:50.424
and you're good with your
hands, so you can do it.

16:50.493 --> 16:52.331
Yeah, you slap stuff and people.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.286
I do slap stuff and people.

16:54.353 --> 16:56.434
Okay, so let's do my plan.

16:56.606 --> 16:57.790
Okay, Coach.

16:57.857 --> 16:59.808
Coach, I backed you up on
that, but maybe in the future,

16:59.875 --> 17:01.777
run stuff by me first,
before you say it out loud?

17:01.845 --> 17:03.700
Okay, Louise, now the
ball probably won't

17:03.767 --> 17:05.018
come to you right away,

17:05.087 --> 17:06.965
but it could in this quarter, so...

17:09.202 --> 17:10.996
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.837
Oh, yeah!

17:16.714 --> 17:18.450
The steamroller. Louise,

17:18.519 --> 17:21.176
- I have another coachy thought!
- Just shout it out!

17:21.246 --> 17:22.943
Or you can discuss it
with your assistant first.

17:23.011 --> 17:24.575
Louise, the steamroller!

17:24.644 --> 17:25.873
Oh, from the show!

17:25.940 --> 17:27.791
Yes! It'll cut off her angle!

17:27.858 --> 17:29.052
It's our only hope!

17:32.099 --> 17:33.359
What the...?

17:36.928 --> 17:38.163
Ah, ha, ha!

17:38.230 --> 17:39.363
I've got it!

17:39.430 --> 17:41.292
- Yeah! -Yeah!

17:41.359 --> 17:43.174
Did Kayla not score?

17:43.243 --> 17:45.330
Kayla, don't wipe that
dirt off your face!

17:45.399 --> 17:47.729
You keep that on to
remind you of what you did!

17:47.798 --> 17:49.068
What... what do I do now?

17:49.135 --> 17:50.829
It, uh... throw it somewhere?

17:50.898 --> 17:52.991
Kick it! Drop-kick that
son of a bitch! -

17:53.530 --> 17:54.798
Wow, that hurt my foot.

17:54.932 --> 17:56.239
Where were you?

17:56.306 --> 17:57.368
I play halfback.

17:57.435 --> 17:58.675
I was halfway back.

17:58.742 --> 18:00.602
Girls, don't throw grass like that.

18:00.672 --> 18:02.039
You throw it like this!

18:02.321 --> 18:04.603
- Hey!
- Stop throwing grass.

18:04.672 --> 18:05.705
You stop it.

18:05.774 --> 18:07.884
You guys, get it together.

18:07.951 --> 18:09.298
Uh, Gold Dragons?

18:09.376 --> 18:10.820
- The ball?
- The ball?

18:10.887 --> 18:12.488
Yeah! You-you can, uh...

18:12.555 --> 18:13.616
you know.

18:13.683 --> 18:14.717
Kick it?

18:14.786 --> 18:15.862
Mm-hmm.

18:22.712 --> 18:25.917
Guys, that's kind of distracting.

18:30.166 --> 18:31.439
Goal.

18:31.507 --> 18:33.635
You did it! - Hell yeah!

18:33.702 --> 18:34.870
Hell yeah, Walter!

18:34.937 --> 18:36.804
We didn't get shutouted!

18:38.080 --> 18:39.767
Yeah!

18:39.836 --> 18:40.864
Great job, girls!

18:41.010 --> 18:42.050
I'm coaching!

18:42.117 --> 18:43.384
I'm actually coaching!

18:43.454 --> 18:45.420
Harley, I will fix your ponytail!

18:45.487 --> 18:47.581
Mara, let me take a
whack at those shoelaces!

18:47.650 --> 18:48.759
Sami, you should live

18:48.828 --> 18:51.166
with whichever parent
makes you feel safe!

18:51.235 --> 18:52.377
Not bad, Coach.

18:52.446 --> 18:54.295
That one moment when
you were good at it.

18:54.362 --> 18:56.509
It was a couple of really
good moments, technically.

18:56.578 --> 18:58.916
Yeah! Oh, uh, forget
about that shoelace.

18:58.985 --> 19:00.128
You're-you're gonna
have to cut those off.

19:00.196 --> 19:01.196
You got it, Coach.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.103
Fly, Pelican Brief, fly!

19:04.172 --> 19:05.424
Oh, right.

19:05.493 --> 19:06.774
We have to keep playing.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.236
You're a musical midget.

19:08.303 --> 19:09.931
You're a doddering old diva.

19:10.017 --> 19:11.685
This is the best day of my life.

19:11.752 --> 19:14.182
I know, but I'm worried
someone's gonna get killed.

19:14.249 --> 19:16.415
These are very sharp criticisms.

19:16.517 --> 19:19.515
Oh, okay, okay, wait,
wait, hold on a second.

19:19.655 --> 19:22.729
This is Gene and Linda's Piano Bar: 
Show Tunes and Mouth Foods.

19:22.798 --> 19:24.209
And we like a little drama,

19:24.276 --> 19:26.877
but we can't let two
veterans of the stage fight...

19:26.946 --> 19:28.962
longer than you have
already been fighting.

19:29.056 --> 19:31.699
Ms. Merkin, did Sheila
ever have a good show?

19:31.954 --> 19:33.712
Sure. Thousands.

19:33.830 --> 19:35.532
Literally. She's older than dirt.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.159
And, Sheila, did Ms. Merkin ever

19:38.228 --> 19:39.917
impress you with her impressive playing?

19:39.984 --> 19:42.534
Mm, eh, Matilda's been good

19:42.603 --> 19:44.807
since before she could
button her own bloomers.

19:44.874 --> 19:46.971
Wait, how long have you
two known each other?

19:47.040 --> 19:48.855
Forever. We're sisters.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.337
- What? - What?
- Ooh, hot.

19:51.406 --> 19:53.581
Oh, my God, you have to make up.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.862
You're a showbiz family,
like the Smuckers Brothers

19:55.931 --> 19:57.396
or the Twisted Sisters.

19:57.548 --> 20:01.166
Oh, Sheila, I'm sorry if I
was late on a couple cues.

20:01.321 --> 20:03.719
Maybe I was jealous that you
were in the spotlight again.

20:03.954 --> 20:06.909
Oh, Matilda, I'm lost
without you backing me up.

20:06.978 --> 20:09.176
I sing like an old barn
cat when you're not there.

20:09.243 --> 20:11.310
Hey, how about another
number from the show?

20:11.471 --> 20:13.099
"If You See Something, Sing Something"?

20:13.171 --> 20:15.671
- You know my key.

20:25.404 --> 20:28.346
Is it possible it's still on
the grill, and it's on fire?

20:28.415 --> 20:30.413
- Oh, my God, Teddy's burger!
- Oh, God, oh, God.

20:31.389 --> 20:33.038
Honestly, leaving you two alone,

20:33.107 --> 20:34.871
I thought it would be way worse.

20:34.955 --> 20:36.796
No, it's not a fire fire.

20:36.874 --> 20:38.672
They're just putting out the smoke.

20:38.741 --> 20:40.749
Uh-huh. Did you guys have fun?

20:40.818 --> 20:42.899
- Oh, it was the best.
- I'm a manager now.

20:42.968 --> 20:45.008
And I'm a manager in training. Eh...

20:45.077 --> 20:46.771
- What?
- Nothing. How was the game?

20:46.838 --> 20:48.867
Great. We lost 21 to one.

20:48.936 --> 20:50.555
Oh, that's good, honey.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.719
- Is that good?
- I don't know sports or math.

20:52.788 --> 20:54.469
They gave their gosh darn all out there,

20:54.538 --> 20:56.140
and we're gonna do it again next season.

20:56.209 --> 20:57.655
- Oh, yeah, maybe not.
- Oh, no.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.498
But I can still assistant
coach again, right?

20:59.567 --> 21:00.696
Every damn day, Tina.

21:00.765 --> 21:02.008
I frickin' love you, man.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.069
Aw, you guys were having so much fun,

21:04.139 --> 21:06.553
you don't even care that you're
missing the Supreme marathon.
