00:00.101 --> 00:02.254
<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

00:04.113 --> 00:05.458
<i>You're going to
have a love scene.</i>

00:05.570 --> 00:07.561
And between you, me and
soon a national audience,

00:07.755 --> 00:09.359
it's more of a love affair.

00:09.969 --> 00:11.446
Oh, my goodness.

00:11.603 --> 00:13.092
I don't want to live on
the Upper East Side.

00:13.204 --> 00:14.082
Why?

00:14.181 --> 00:17.298
I saw us raising our kids in a place
with more different kinds of people.

00:18.394 --> 00:20.944
We created a human life.

00:22.111 --> 00:23.498
When you told me
about the merger,

00:23.648 --> 00:25.667
I hoped he would
rub off on you.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.667
Obviously, you're on his side.

00:27.817 --> 00:29.954
Why did you do it all
off their sides?

01:07.302 --> 01:10.304
It tastes better
because it's more expensive.

01:10.339 --> 01:12.539
It's the premium brand
and it's priced accordingly.

01:12.574 --> 01:14.441
Price is irrelevant
because the question is

01:14.476 --> 01:16.510
does it taste
better than butter?

01:16.544 --> 01:19.847
Butter is actually fresh.
Margarine is indestructible.

01:19.881 --> 01:22.750
He's right because he's only
comparing different margarines

01:22.784 --> 01:25.719
and margarine has a 70%
market share over butter.

01:25.754 --> 01:28.821
But it's hard to say
any brand is luxury

01:28.856 --> 01:30.823
<i>when although Fleischmann's</i>
<i>is the most expensive</i>

01:30.858 --> 01:32.592
and Blue Bonnet,
owned by the same company,

01:32.626 --> 01:35.160
is the least expensive,
the difference is only pennies.

01:35.195 --> 01:37.397
45 cents a pound
is the highest.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.533
29 is the lowest.
That's 50% more expensive.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.134
Fleischmann's is Chivas Regal.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.035
Still half the price of butter.

01:44.069 --> 01:46.371
- It's Budweiser.
- But what's the market share?

01:46.406 --> 01:48.072
I just said it's much
higher than butter.

01:48.107 --> 01:50.041
Seeing as I have
the ear of the client,

01:50.075 --> 01:54.012
it's my recommendation
we go on taste alone.

01:54.046 --> 01:55.313
Peggy!

01:57.383 --> 01:59.517
Don, I agree with you.

02:03.822 --> 02:05.523
You're in the market
buying margarine.

02:05.557 --> 02:07.525
Okay.

02:07.559 --> 02:10.160
What goes through your mind?

02:10.193 --> 02:13.263
Mouthwatering, savory,
delicious taste?

02:13.298 --> 02:17.400
Or mouthwatering, savory,
delicious taste and price?

02:17.435 --> 02:19.969
I'd buy the cheaper one.

02:20.003 --> 02:22.906
There's one for 45 cents
a pound and one for 29.

02:22.940 --> 02:25.341
Which one do you think
is gonna taste better?

02:25.375 --> 02:28.445
It's a terrible gamble to tell a client
that their product is expensive.

02:28.479 --> 02:31.880
Shh.
Let her answer.

02:34.016 --> 02:35.984
I don't know.

02:36.018 --> 02:37.486
They both sound good.

02:37.520 --> 02:38.821
Really?

02:38.855 --> 02:40.522
Does everyone agree with yours?

02:40.557 --> 02:42.424
It's not his and mine.
Everyone has an opinion.

02:42.459 --> 02:43.892
We haven't heard it,
but I'm sure they do.

02:43.927 --> 02:45.293
I like Don's.

02:45.328 --> 02:47.095
What did Harry say?

02:48.296 --> 02:50.264
I feel strongly both ways.

02:52.067 --> 02:53.668
They're both so good.

02:53.702 --> 02:56.637
I'd probably ask someone to run
them by the client on the sly.

02:56.672 --> 02:58.272
The meeting's tomorrow.

03:02.644 --> 03:04.511
You know what, Don?
Let's go with yours.

03:05.713 --> 03:07.981
Nah, I'm not even
gonna be there.

03:09.617 --> 03:12.151
You should go with whatever
you're most comfortable with.

03:22.496 --> 03:24.096
Could you get me another
copy of that research?

03:24.130 --> 03:25.965
I want to make it big
on a board.

03:28.702 --> 03:31.704
Did you see that?
He didn't even turn around.

03:31.738 --> 03:33.939
- Yep.
- Oh, it speaks.

03:33.974 --> 03:35.840
Come on, I wasn't gonna
get in the middle of that.

03:35.875 --> 03:37.174
You suddenly dumber than Peggy?

03:37.209 --> 03:39.243
So you're content in silence?

03:39.277 --> 03:41.112
I'm content with reality.

03:41.146 --> 03:43.014
You know what this place looks
like to the outside world?

03:43.048 --> 03:45.082
A mess. We don't
even have a name.

03:45.117 --> 03:47.685
- We're the '27 Yankees.
- Says who?

03:47.720 --> 03:50.655
Pete, you want to get
your balls tickled?

03:50.689 --> 03:52.155
Go see a headhunter.

03:52.189 --> 03:53.891
Are you leaving?

03:53.925 --> 03:56.259
Look, when things settle down,
I'm gonna be a partner.

03:56.293 --> 03:59.262
For the time being, it's nice to know
that the water's warm out there.

04:08.238 --> 04:10.540
Did you lose something?

04:10.574 --> 04:12.708
Yes.

04:12.743 --> 04:14.977
I was looking for...

04:15.012 --> 04:18.014
how do you say, a pen
to write something down.

04:18.048 --> 04:21.951
Oh, well, the desk
is littered with them.

04:25.154 --> 04:27.022
Would you like a drink?

04:27.056 --> 04:28.857
Certainly, Colette.

04:28.891 --> 04:30.792
Although this is
my husband's office.

04:30.826 --> 04:32.126
I should be offering you one.

04:32.161 --> 04:33.862
It is no trouble at all.

04:33.896 --> 04:35.764
We're a lot alike.

04:35.798 --> 04:38.967
We're both interested
in things that belong to me.

04:42.871 --> 04:45.773
I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.741
I don't know what
your relationship is

04:47.776 --> 04:50.010
with my husband, but it's over.

04:50.045 --> 04:52.613
<i>Cut. Let's clean
up in there and back up.</i>

04:55.816 --> 04:57.850
<i>Megan, sweetheart, what are
you doing on the floor?</i>

04:57.885 --> 04:59.852
The script said
to spill the drink.

04:59.887 --> 05:01.654
<i>It doesn't say to clean it up.</i>

05:01.689 --> 05:03.355
I just thought...

05:03.390 --> 05:05.224
<i>Your sister Corinne</i>
<i>is the maid.</i>

05:05.258 --> 05:08.527
<i>You're Colette right now.</i>
<i>She's blonde, classy.</i>

05:08.562 --> 05:11.597
<i>We need you to make</i>
<i>these women different, honey.</i>

05:11.631 --> 05:14.066
<i>Let's take it</i>
<i>from the top, ladies.</i>

05:14.100 --> 05:15.901
Don't worry about it.

05:21.641 --> 05:24.610
I think Phyllis left for the day, but
I never saw the boards for tomorrow.

05:24.644 --> 05:27.345
- Stan has them.
- Ah.

05:27.379 --> 05:29.981
- What are you working on?
- Royal Hawaiian.

05:30.015 --> 05:32.850
- How's that going?
- I'm sure you will tell me.

05:32.884 --> 05:34.819
I will.

05:34.853 --> 05:36.487
I'll look at it very carefully

05:36.521 --> 05:39.456
and then I'll formulate
an educated opinion.

05:39.491 --> 05:41.792
You should try it sometime.
It's what professionals do.

05:41.827 --> 05:43.760
Don.

05:44.962 --> 05:46.863
You've been debating
that for weeks.

05:46.897 --> 05:49.565
- You both have a point.
- I'm not paying you to be a diplomat.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.467
Well, you're both
more experienced than me.

05:51.502 --> 05:53.236
I don't know
that my opinion matters.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.704
Your opinion matters.

05:54.739 --> 05:56.806
Now what do you think
is the best way to go?

05:56.841 --> 05:58.708
- It's somewhere in the middle.
- No, Peggy.

05:58.743 --> 06:00.809
There's a right
and there's a wrong.

06:00.844 --> 06:02.544
How could that be?

06:02.578 --> 06:05.347
What you're really saying is
there's you and there's him.

06:05.381 --> 06:08.350
And I don't know how I became in charge
of turning this into a collaboration.

06:08.384 --> 06:10.552
Isn't that your job?

06:10.586 --> 06:12.521
You're both demanding
and you're both pigheaded.

06:12.555 --> 06:14.589
You're the same person
sometimes.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.758
The difference is that
he's interested in the idea

06:16.792 --> 06:18.592
and you're interested
in your idea.

06:20.763 --> 06:23.430
He's interested in his idea.
Don't let him fool you.

06:23.465 --> 06:25.900
Well, he never makes me
feel this way.

06:25.934 --> 06:27.969
He doesn't know you.

06:42.917 --> 06:45.652
Henry said you were leaving.

06:45.687 --> 06:47.353
He just had to make
one phone call,

06:47.388 --> 06:48.954
which turned out to be two.

06:48.989 --> 06:50.322
Full house, I see.

06:50.356 --> 06:52.591
He should be off in a minute.

06:52.625 --> 06:54.426
Well, he's a lucky man.
But not as lucky as me,

06:54.460 --> 06:56.162
because I wanted to be
alone with you all night.

06:56.196 --> 06:58.330
He'll be out in a minute.

06:58.364 --> 07:01.633
I don't think you heard.

07:01.668 --> 07:05.937
I want to be alone
with <i>you</i> all night.

07:05.971 --> 07:08.606
Mr. Dell, I have
three children.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.141
I don't care.

07:11.410 --> 07:13.678
No, look at me.

07:13.713 --> 07:15.680
Can you believe
I've had three children?

07:25.223 --> 07:27.457
How was your evening, Stew?

07:27.491 --> 07:29.093
Raised a lot of money.

07:29.127 --> 07:31.695
Darling, shall we?

07:38.836 --> 07:42.171
- What's going on?
- There was an incident.

07:42.206 --> 07:44.006
Oh, my God!

07:44.041 --> 07:46.542
- They hurt you.
- I'm fine, honey.

07:46.576 --> 07:49.678
He was getting off the subway
and two guys stabbed him.

07:49.713 --> 07:52.114
- What?
- Hey, I don't want to worry her, man.

07:52.148 --> 07:54.249
I'm sorry, but I'm trying
to get it straight.

07:54.283 --> 07:57.485
And, frankly, she should know
so she can keep up her defense.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.621
- Jesus, what happened?
- Are we done here?

07:59.655 --> 08:03.358
For a reporter,
this is missing detail.

08:03.392 --> 08:05.460
And if you'd waited
at the hospital,

08:05.494 --> 08:07.662
as you were instructed,
we'd be done.

08:07.696 --> 08:10.297
But for some reason you didn't.

08:10.331 --> 08:12.032
I filled out the form.

08:12.067 --> 08:14.701
Come on, were they colored
or Puerto Rican?

08:14.736 --> 08:16.336
Or white?

08:16.371 --> 08:18.773
I'm from Brooklyn and I
always keep my eyes down.

08:18.807 --> 08:21.242
Could you describe the shoes?

08:21.276 --> 08:24.077
Look, both of us have done
our civic duty.

08:24.111 --> 08:26.545
So, respectfully,
I think you should go.

08:32.253 --> 08:34.486
I'd get one of these.

08:36.456 --> 08:38.424
Good evening, ma'am.

08:40.193 --> 08:42.160
Can you believe
those questions?

08:42.195 --> 08:45.164
- Fascist pig!
- Shut up, Abe!

08:45.198 --> 08:46.631
You don't know
what they look like?

08:46.666 --> 08:48.100
You have a photographic memory.

08:48.134 --> 08:49.734
Peg, I'm not gonna
give him an excuse

08:49.769 --> 08:51.503
to shake down every kid that
walks through this neighborhood.

08:51.537 --> 08:53.238
What about the one
that stabbed you?

08:53.273 --> 08:55.007
This is a fucking police state

08:55.041 --> 08:56.707
and we're gonna
have to fight, okay?

08:56.741 --> 08:58.375
They did it in Prague.
They did it in Paris.

08:58.410 --> 09:00.044
And, believe it or not, we're
gonna have to do it here, too.

09:00.078 --> 09:02.180
That doesn't mean
protecting criminals.

09:02.214 --> 09:05.850
Listen, baby, it's my right to
tell whomever whatever I want.

09:05.884 --> 09:09.086
But you can keep talking because
everything you say is going in my story.

09:09.121 --> 09:10.654
What are you talking about?

09:10.689 --> 09:13.756
It's just fascinating,
the attitudes I'm encountering.

09:13.791 --> 09:16.092
But why would you side
with the cops?

09:16.127 --> 09:18.094
I don't know.

09:22.666 --> 09:24.968
I read about this.

09:27.271 --> 09:31.040
You obviously had
a traumatic experience

09:31.074 --> 09:32.842
not unlike combat.

09:32.876 --> 09:37.213
So I'm going to let you do
whatever you're doing.

09:37.247 --> 09:39.448
Don't patronize me.

09:39.482 --> 09:42.284
Those kids have no other
recourse in this system.

09:42.319 --> 09:44.585
- They're animals.
- They were brought here by slave ships.

09:44.619 --> 09:46.254
Well, I was
brought here by you.

09:46.288 --> 09:48.723
I don't care if I take a loss,
I'm gonna sell this shithole.

09:48.757 --> 09:52.327
You're worried about me
and I love you for it.

09:54.863 --> 09:56.830
Now, I don't think
I can type with this thing.

09:56.865 --> 09:58.732
Get my Olympia. Help me
get some of this down.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.701
I'm going to bed.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.211
This is nice.

10:12.246 --> 10:15.414
It's Thursday.
Told you I was making dinner.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.586
Sit down.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.457
How was your day?

10:26.492 --> 10:28.226
How was yours?

10:28.261 --> 10:29.961
Hmm.

10:29.996 --> 10:31.296
It was...

10:31.330 --> 10:33.365
Ugh, it was terrible.

10:33.399 --> 10:35.566
I don't even know
if I want to talk about it.

10:37.169 --> 10:39.237
What's for dinner?

10:39.272 --> 10:40.872
I think they hate me.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.740
They just gave you
a second part.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.443
I feel like an idiot
because they keep telling me

10:45.477 --> 10:47.278
they can't tell
the twins apart.

10:47.312 --> 10:49.980
I think I'm playing them
very differently.

10:50.015 --> 10:51.883
It's not like
it's never been done before.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.584
Exactly.

10:53.619 --> 10:56.854
I told Mel I didn't want
to be a cliché.

10:56.889 --> 11:01.124
Then he starts rapping about how
they're two halves of the same person

11:01.158 --> 11:04.761
and they want the same thing, but they're
trying to get it in different ways.

11:16.005 --> 11:19.241
Listen, would you mind if we
just go in and turn on the set?

11:19.275 --> 11:20.776
I'm really not hungry.

11:20.811 --> 11:22.678
Did you have a bad day?

11:24.714 --> 11:26.148
I'm just tired.

11:27.818 --> 11:30.852
Go lay down.
I'll clean up.

11:32.287 --> 11:35.557
I already packed your bag
for Bobby's camp.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.561
Tomorrow's another day.

11:47.268 --> 11:49.903
John, could you give us
some privacy?

11:55.076 --> 11:56.810
Was the evening a success?

11:56.845 --> 11:58.445
You tell me.

12:00.982 --> 12:03.549
Well, I--

12:03.584 --> 12:06.185
I found it fascinating as usual

12:06.219 --> 12:08.821
watching you work your magic.

12:08.856 --> 12:11.056
And while you were watching me,

12:11.091 --> 12:14.259
everyone was watching you,
weren't they?

12:21.233 --> 12:23.802
Stewart did everything
but grab your ass.

12:26.839 --> 12:28.540
I didn't notice.

12:28.574 --> 12:30.542
What did he say to you?

12:33.646 --> 12:35.946
I don't want to get
anyone in trouble.

12:35.981 --> 12:37.948
Word for word.

12:41.953 --> 12:44.488
He said he wanted
to be alone with me.

12:47.592 --> 12:50.293
What else?

12:50.328 --> 12:52.294
All night.

13:02.873 --> 13:05.107
Daddy, I don't want him
running on the steps.

13:05.142 --> 13:07.108
Why not?
Kids are supposed to run.

13:07.143 --> 13:09.711
Ellery, come down.

13:09.746 --> 13:11.479
We don't have any steps
in the apartment.

13:11.514 --> 13:12.848
He's not good at them.

13:15.317 --> 13:17.886
So what do you think, girls?

13:17.921 --> 13:19.621
See any resemblance?

13:19.656 --> 13:21.657
He's very handsome.

13:21.691 --> 13:23.658
So, Ellery, take a good look.

13:23.692 --> 13:26.627
Who's your type?

13:26.662 --> 13:28.462
Hello, Margaret.

13:28.496 --> 13:30.130
I'll tell you mine later.

13:30.165 --> 13:32.066
It's nice to see you.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.902
Oh, he's precious.
How old is he?

13:34.937 --> 13:38.305
He's four. He's having a
special day with Pop-pop.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.406
We're going to the zoo
and maybe the movies.

13:40.441 --> 13:41.975
So it's just a regular workday.

13:43.644 --> 13:45.511
Don't fill him full of junk.

13:45.546 --> 13:47.547
Can't promise that.

13:49.684 --> 13:51.417
Wave good-bye, swabby.

13:51.452 --> 13:52.752
We're shoving off.

13:56.355 --> 13:58.190
How many times
have you met with Harry?

13:58.224 --> 14:00.726
Too many. Don't waste
my time like Crane.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.962
I'm a headhunter,
not a fan club.

14:02.996 --> 14:05.664
Fine, let's talk about me.

14:05.699 --> 14:07.733
Let's talk about Burt Peterson.

14:07.767 --> 14:09.902
I got him a vice
presidency at McCann.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.903
If he keeps his head down,
he's set for life.

14:11.937 --> 14:16.373
But the merger was fresh.
I don't know your situation.

14:16.408 --> 14:18.009
You weren't very straight
on the phone.

14:18.043 --> 14:19.644
You think they're gonna
cut you loose?

14:19.678 --> 14:22.513
How come you didn't
get yourself a job?

14:23.849 --> 14:25.917
That's a Yankee wrinkle.

14:25.951 --> 14:28.752
- You interested in my business?
- No.

14:28.786 --> 14:32.789
Well, if we sat down
a couple of months ago,

14:32.824 --> 14:34.758
this would have been
a different conversation.

14:34.792 --> 14:36.627
Nothing's changed.
I'll show you my Rolodex.

14:36.661 --> 14:39.896
It's not that. It's your lack of a
role in the management structure.

14:39.931 --> 14:43.065
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce
Cutler Gleason and Chaough?

14:43.100 --> 14:44.500
Who the hell's in charge?

14:44.534 --> 14:46.535
Two of those men
are as dead as doornails.

14:46.569 --> 14:48.938
There's still a lot of chiefs
and only a couple of Indians.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.973
And a lot of questions.

14:51.008 --> 14:52.808
What the hell
happened with Vicks?

14:54.778 --> 14:56.712
So...

14:56.747 --> 14:58.447
paint me a new portrait.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.882
I'm glad you said that.

15:00.916 --> 15:03.284
How about seeing things
from the client side?

15:03.318 --> 15:06.187
There's a head of marketing job in
Wichita that you'd be perfect for.

15:06.221 --> 15:07.756
Anything back here on Earth?

15:07.790 --> 15:09.791
You know,

15:09.825 --> 15:11.259
I've always liked you,
Campbell,

15:11.293 --> 15:13.028
so forgive me for saying this,

15:13.062 --> 15:15.329
but if you do a little better,
I can do a lot better.

15:15.364 --> 15:17.632
I don't know
what else I can do.

15:20.269 --> 15:22.603
I've been you

15:22.638 --> 15:24.104
and I went on interviews

15:24.139 --> 15:27.441
and I realized I was filling
the room with desperation.

15:28.943 --> 15:31.344
Five cents worth
of free advice.

15:31.379 --> 15:33.313
You've got to spend
less time in this place

15:33.347 --> 15:34.648
and more at home.

15:34.682 --> 15:37.050
This is a reluctant necessity.

15:37.084 --> 15:38.552
My mother's run amok.

15:39.787 --> 15:42.622
Pete, one day
I looked in the mirror

15:42.657 --> 15:45.325
and I realized I had regrets
because I didn't understand

15:45.359 --> 15:47.060
the wellspring
of my confidence.

15:47.094 --> 15:48.260
Gin?

15:48.295 --> 15:50.128
My family.

15:50.163 --> 15:53.065
My family is a constant
distraction.

15:54.234 --> 15:55.734
You better manage that

15:55.768 --> 15:57.570
or you're not gonna
manage anything.

16:07.012 --> 16:08.680
Hey, buddy.

16:19.757 --> 16:21.458
Can you help me?

16:21.492 --> 16:23.860
I'm occupied
at the moment, sir.

16:36.506 --> 16:37.806
Hello there.

16:39.243 --> 16:42.378
Oh.
Are you lost, too?

16:42.412 --> 16:44.547
Not yet.

16:44.581 --> 16:46.782
I'm trying to get some gas.

16:46.816 --> 16:48.851
Lady asked for directions.

16:48.885 --> 16:50.653
Fill 'er up with regular.

16:53.289 --> 16:54.756
Where's Henry?

16:54.790 --> 16:57.259
He's coming tomorrow.

16:57.293 --> 16:59.394
I'm surprised you
were able to get away.

16:59.428 --> 17:02.764
Where are you staying?

17:02.798 --> 17:04.665
Somewhere over here.

17:08.770 --> 17:11.305
Just go down here. Stay
on here a mile and a half

17:11.339 --> 17:13.473
till you get to the big mill.
Make a left.

17:13.508 --> 17:15.608
Go back through town
till the railroad tracks.

17:15.644 --> 17:17.144
Hang a right over the bridge

17:17.178 --> 17:19.212
and then you come
to the little mill.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.181
Do any of the roads have names?

17:21.214 --> 17:23.583
Follow me.

17:30.432 --> 17:31.733
Fleischmann's just called.

17:31.767 --> 17:34.268
See? You were worried
for nothing.

17:34.302 --> 17:37.304
Well, they just requested some more
recent figures on market share.

17:37.339 --> 17:38.840
I'll handle it.

17:38.874 --> 17:40.541
Peggy, may I speak with you?
Go ahead.

17:45.947 --> 17:47.380
What the hell were you
doing back there?

17:47.414 --> 17:49.215
You didn't want me to talk.

17:49.250 --> 17:52.019
I didn't talk. That was the plan.
Did you want me to talk?

17:52.053 --> 17:54.587
- No, you touched my hand.
- What?

17:54.622 --> 17:56.422
When you handed me the board.

17:56.457 --> 17:57.990
What?
No, I didn't.

17:58.025 --> 18:01.160
Yes, you did. And you can't
do that in a presentation.

18:01.194 --> 18:03.796
I doubt anyone saw that because
I didn't even know I did it.

18:03.830 --> 18:06.832
It jarred me. And when I finally
caught up, then you smiled.

18:06.867 --> 18:09.201
You can't smile
at me like that.

18:09.235 --> 18:10.569
I never should have kissed you.

18:16.375 --> 18:19.944
I assumed we were
forgetting about that.

18:22.314 --> 18:23.915
I forgot it.

18:23.949 --> 18:26.651
Well, I haven't.

18:28.353 --> 18:30.320
Oh.

18:32.157 --> 18:34.491
What an old tune.

18:34.525 --> 18:37.661
The boss in love
with his protégé.

18:37.696 --> 18:40.597
Is this all me?
Because that'll help.

18:41.632 --> 18:43.466
I think about it.

18:45.635 --> 18:48.104
Well, we can't. I have
someone, you have someone.

18:48.138 --> 18:51.407
And believe me, I've considered
it a lot further than that.

18:51.441 --> 18:54.643
I didn't know
you felt this way.

18:58.949 --> 19:01.416
I don't want to,
that's the point.

19:01.450 --> 19:03.885
Now I realize I never
should have brought it up.

19:05.722 --> 19:07.889
Do you want me
to work someplace else?

19:07.924 --> 19:09.557
No.

19:09.592 --> 19:10.926
Of course not.

19:22.104 --> 19:24.304
Come on, you have to do it.

19:26.474 --> 19:28.075
And the left.

19:28.110 --> 19:32.213
♪ Father Abraham had
seven sons, seven sons ♪

19:32.247 --> 19:35.481
♪ And seven sons

19:35.515 --> 19:37.550
Daddy, you came!

19:39.586 --> 19:41.054
You didn't tell him I was here?

19:41.088 --> 19:43.422
I wanted it to be a surprise.

19:43.457 --> 19:45.158
You catch any fish?

19:45.192 --> 19:48.161
Damn it, I made you a wallet,
but it's back in my cabin.

19:48.195 --> 19:49.461
Bobby, language.

19:49.495 --> 19:51.463
We'll get it later.

19:54.901 --> 19:57.469
Mommy said we can have
anything we want.

19:57.503 --> 19:59.872
Hi!

19:59.906 --> 20:01.573
This is my mom and dad.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.643
That's Bobby Two.
He's shy.

20:05.677 --> 20:08.146
Are you Bobby or Bobby One?

20:08.180 --> 20:09.613
I'm Bobby Five.

20:09.648 --> 20:11.849
It's sad. There's no
Bobby One anymore.

20:11.884 --> 20:13.617
Because of Bobby Kennedy?

20:13.652 --> 20:15.586
No, he went home.

20:15.620 --> 20:18.189
Do you want me to get the
waitress so you can get a drink?

20:19.724 --> 20:22.058
- Is that possible?
- No.

20:22.093 --> 20:25.061
Mommy's having a chef salad
and I'm having a cheeseburger.

20:25.096 --> 20:26.863
What do you want
so I can order?

20:26.898 --> 20:29.132
What's good here?

20:29.167 --> 20:31.334
I'm afraid nothing.

20:31.368 --> 20:33.569
Daddy, I want
to teach you this song.

20:33.604 --> 20:35.272
Just do what I do.

20:35.306 --> 20:39.541

21:06.501 --> 21:08.836
Can I walk you out?

21:10.004 --> 21:12.105
Certainly, if you
don't mind waiting.

21:16.010 --> 21:18.011
I need your advice.

21:18.046 --> 21:20.580
And, well,
it's of a personal nature

21:20.614 --> 21:22.850
and thus above Clara's
security clearance.

21:22.884 --> 21:24.751
How can I help you?

21:26.519 --> 21:29.255
Do you feel my attention
to business has been dilute?

21:38.365 --> 21:40.499
How personal
is this conversation?

21:42.001 --> 21:45.170
I'm being pulled
in a million directions.

21:45.204 --> 21:48.306
My wife, my child, my mother.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.175
I can't solve
those problems, Pete.

21:50.209 --> 21:51.943
I have those problems.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.711
I live with my mother.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.081
Has your mother exhausted
every nursing agency?

21:56.115 --> 21:58.249
No, but she's exhausted me.

21:58.283 --> 22:00.817
Well...

22:00.852 --> 22:03.153
the options are
my home and a home,

22:03.188 --> 22:05.322
neither of which
will make me feel better.

22:05.357 --> 22:07.324
I am sorry to hear that.

22:08.793 --> 22:11.929
- Do you want to get supper?
- I can't. I have plans.

22:17.334 --> 22:19.168
Thank you, Joan.

22:19.203 --> 22:22.005
- For what?
- I don't know.

22:27.936 --> 22:29.771
Welcome.

22:29.805 --> 22:31.739
Oh, I'm a little damp.

22:31.774 --> 22:33.374
Did it finally rain?

22:33.409 --> 22:36.277
No, but I walked.
This was cold when I left.

22:36.311 --> 22:38.445
You walked from the West Side?

22:39.847 --> 22:42.549
What an incredible space.

22:42.583 --> 22:44.050
Did you do this yourself?

22:44.084 --> 22:46.186
Oh, I had a little help.

22:46.220 --> 22:49.723
Arlene, you read about the
shootings in the park, didn't you?

22:49.757 --> 22:51.825
I'm not gonna let
a few lunatics

22:51.859 --> 22:53.592
ruin a gorgeous night
like this.

23:00.467 --> 23:02.134
Should I go get my script?

23:02.168 --> 23:04.870
Megan, darling,

23:04.904 --> 23:06.739
you're a good actress

23:06.773 --> 23:08.640
on your way to becoming, well,

23:08.674 --> 23:10.442
at least a successful one.

23:10.476 --> 23:12.711
There's nothing I can
tell you about that script.

23:12.745 --> 23:14.679
I came over here because
I'm worried about you.

23:14.714 --> 23:16.748
Am I gonna get fired?

23:18.718 --> 23:20.852
I remember my first job.

23:20.886 --> 23:22.454
Believe it or not, in radio.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.288
"Against the Storm."

23:24.323 --> 23:28.425
Very classy, a lot of
big words, high morals.

23:28.460 --> 23:30.794
And my agent,
who I later learned

23:30.829 --> 23:32.596
was angling
to sign Roger DeKoven,

23:32.630 --> 23:34.665
told me my voice was childish.

23:34.699 --> 23:36.567
And every day I would
vacillate between

23:36.601 --> 23:39.035
"Arlene, you're wonderful"
and "Arlene, you're caca."

23:40.437 --> 23:42.505
Which was it?

23:42.539 --> 23:44.540
Honestly?

23:44.575 --> 23:46.576
I was wonderful.

23:53.517 --> 23:55.050
You should go inside.

23:55.085 --> 23:56.885
You'll get eaten
alive out here.

23:56.919 --> 23:59.220
You know mosquitos ignore me.

23:59.255 --> 24:00.889
In those shorts?

24:05.595 --> 24:07.128
Did you find a bottle?

24:08.664 --> 24:09.865
Maybe.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.946
Cheers.

24:32.586 --> 24:34.854
I loved camp.

24:37.591 --> 24:39.692
I never went.

24:39.727 --> 24:41.594
Yes, you did.

24:43.497 --> 24:46.398
Remember when we went to Lake
Champlain with my parents?

24:48.200 --> 24:50.569
I remember.

24:50.603 --> 24:52.538
And you got in a horrible
fight with my father

24:52.572 --> 24:54.372
about who would
carry the luggage.

24:55.708 --> 24:58.811
And then we went in the
woods and made Sally.

25:01.212 --> 25:03.681
I don't understand her.

25:05.417 --> 25:07.585
Henry says
she's a lot like you.

25:07.619 --> 25:09.720
How would he know?

25:09.755 --> 25:11.989
He says she reminds him of you.

25:12.023 --> 25:14.258
I think she's a lot like you.

25:17.094 --> 25:19.395
Bobby reminds me of my father.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.064
So bossy.

25:23.334 --> 25:26.069
All the teenagers
of the world are in revolt.

25:32.376 --> 25:34.710
What were we like?

25:36.245 --> 25:38.246
You and me?

25:42.251 --> 25:43.953
When I saw you earlier today

25:43.987 --> 25:46.889
I thought for a second,
"Who is that man?"

25:48.424 --> 25:50.692
And I forgot how mad
I was at you.

25:53.729 --> 25:56.664
Ugh, I don't know what's
happened, but I'm all bit up.

26:30.230 --> 26:32.364
Close the door.
You'll let the bugs in.

26:51.517 --> 26:53.450
What are you doing?

26:53.484 --> 26:56.587
Waiting for you
to tell me to stop.

27:10.734 --> 27:13.570
What did you think
when you saw me?

27:13.604 --> 27:16.539
That you are as beautiful
as the day I met you.

27:27.784 --> 27:29.818
So finally I said to Mel,

27:29.852 --> 27:33.121
"I'm either his mother or his girlfriend.
I can't be both."

27:33.155 --> 27:34.823
That's bad writing.

27:34.857 --> 27:37.025
You're so lucky he's at work.

27:37.060 --> 27:40.128
Please, dear, that's a
complex relationship.

27:40.162 --> 27:42.229
But he understands what you do

27:42.263 --> 27:44.098
and he wants you to be great.

27:44.132 --> 27:46.400
And he's always proud of you.
I've seen it.

27:46.434 --> 27:48.970
Don's very proud of you.

27:49.004 --> 27:51.639
You can tell
by how protective he is.

27:53.842 --> 27:56.510
It's been so different.

27:56.544 --> 28:00.614
You know, we worked together
and I left to pursue this.

28:00.648 --> 28:02.682
And he was so encouraging.

28:02.717 --> 28:05.351
And then you
started succeeding.

28:05.385 --> 28:07.320
He's old-fashioned.

28:07.354 --> 28:08.922
He'll get used to it.

28:08.956 --> 28:11.257
I think he did.

28:11.291 --> 28:15.327
And I think he got used
to me not being around

28:15.361 --> 28:18.497
and having a bunch of problems
that he couldn't solve.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.034
And I don't know

28:22.068 --> 28:25.604
if it's him or me, but...

28:25.639 --> 28:27.372
I feel so lonely.

28:33.278 --> 28:34.746
Arlene.

28:34.780 --> 28:36.447
What?

28:36.481 --> 28:37.982
I want to make you feel better.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.451
This isn't the way.

28:41.820 --> 28:43.755
Forget it.

28:46.257 --> 28:48.391
I can't believe you.

28:48.425 --> 28:51.995
I'm trusting you and you're taking
advantage of every private moment.

28:52.030 --> 28:55.132
Well, what was I
supposed to think?

28:56.768 --> 28:58.501
You invited me over.

28:58.536 --> 29:00.070
Your husband's not here.

29:00.104 --> 29:01.937
Two bottles of wine
to go over a scene

29:01.972 --> 29:03.438
a child could understand.

29:03.473 --> 29:05.174
"I'm so lonely."

29:05.208 --> 29:07.843
I work with you and your
husband is my boss.

29:07.878 --> 29:09.478
And now what am I
supposed to do?

29:09.512 --> 29:11.881
Am I gonna be punished
for not doing something

29:11.915 --> 29:13.849
that you won't stop
trying to do?

29:13.884 --> 29:15.918
Megan, it's okay to say no.

29:15.952 --> 29:18.286
But you don't have
to embarrass me.

29:18.320 --> 29:20.955
I'm sorry.

29:20.990 --> 29:23.424
I didn't mean to.

29:23.458 --> 29:24.993
No, stop it.

29:25.027 --> 29:26.795
You're a tease.

29:26.829 --> 29:28.329
Fine.

29:29.765 --> 29:32.200
No, I'm fine
with being a tease.

29:35.236 --> 29:37.171
Well, honey,

29:37.205 --> 29:38.872
just learn the lines.

29:38.907 --> 29:41.809
Two characters is tough,
but you know what Olivier says,

29:41.843 --> 29:43.811
let the wig do the work.

29:45.914 --> 29:48.148
I'm gonna go
before I--

29:48.183 --> 29:51.417
well, it's too late
for that, isn't it?

29:51.451 --> 29:53.086
Thank you for that.

29:54.688 --> 29:56.989
No hard feelings.

29:57.024 --> 29:59.092
Status quo ante bellum.

29:59.126 --> 30:01.594
Everything as it was.

30:22.678 --> 30:24.613
I missed you.

30:35.924 --> 30:37.992
Do you feel guilty?

30:38.026 --> 30:40.128
No.

30:40.162 --> 30:42.630
This happened a long time ago.

30:52.774 --> 30:54.507
Ugh, menthols.

30:56.043 --> 30:57.677
I don't miss that.

31:04.952 --> 31:07.686
Is this what it would have been
like if we'd stayed together?

31:11.291 --> 31:13.558
I don't think about
that anymore.

31:15.028 --> 31:17.062
I'm happy in my life.

31:17.097 --> 31:19.364
Let's just enjoy this.

31:20.633 --> 31:22.600
But you used to?

31:24.469 --> 31:26.537
What are you thinking
right now?

31:27.973 --> 31:30.241
I'm thinking about
how different you are,

31:30.276 --> 31:32.243
before and after.

31:34.546 --> 31:37.115
I love the way you look at me
when you're like this.

31:38.683 --> 31:40.951
But then I watch it decay.

31:42.253 --> 31:45.422
I can only hold
your attention so long.

31:50.494 --> 31:52.395
Why is sex

31:52.430 --> 31:55.564
the definition of being
close to someone?

31:55.598 --> 31:57.800
I don't know,

31:57.835 --> 31:59.768
but it is for me.

31:59.803 --> 32:01.871
It is for most people.

32:03.506 --> 32:06.342
Just because you climb a mountain
doesn't mean you love it.

32:06.376 --> 32:08.044
Climbing a mountain?

32:08.078 --> 32:10.345
Is that what
making love is to you?

32:10.379 --> 32:13.448
If we'd lied here together
with you in my arms,

32:13.482 --> 32:15.917
I would have felt
just as close.

32:17.286 --> 32:19.287
Not the rest of it.
I don't know.

32:21.657 --> 32:23.959
I don't know.

32:23.993 --> 32:26.126
It doesn't mean
that much to me.

32:28.096 --> 32:30.264
Is it the same with Megan?

32:32.433 --> 32:34.235
Why do you want
to talk about that?

32:34.269 --> 32:36.636
That poor girl.

32:41.442 --> 32:44.844
She doesn't know
that loving you

32:44.879 --> 32:47.546
is the worst way to get to you.

33:07.300 --> 33:09.667
Are you sure you don't
want to just hold me?

33:32.456 --> 33:34.424
Oh, Jesus.

33:34.458 --> 33:37.360
Oh, thank God.
What are you doing in here?

33:37.395 --> 33:39.062
I was just fixing the window.

33:39.096 --> 33:40.563
What the hell happened here?

33:40.597 --> 33:42.732
I'll replace it tomorrow
when I get back from work.

33:42.766 --> 33:44.367
Because you're leaving me here

33:44.402 --> 33:46.135
after someone threw a rock
through our window?

33:46.169 --> 33:47.736
That's not what happened.

33:47.770 --> 33:50.672
Well, I came in here and there's
glass all over the floor

33:50.706 --> 33:52.942
and you're holding a rock.

33:52.976 --> 33:55.610
I'm tired of being
interrogated in my own home.

33:55.645 --> 33:58.380
Do you think they saw you
talking to the police?

33:58.415 --> 34:00.449
If you're gonna let
your imagination run wild,

34:00.483 --> 34:01.650
come to the paper
with me tonight.

34:01.684 --> 34:03.818
Abe, I have to go
to work tomorrow.

34:03.852 --> 34:05.286
And this is our bedroom.

34:05.321 --> 34:07.255
Someone was in our yard.

34:07.289 --> 34:09.123
I'm really scared here.

34:09.158 --> 34:11.592
And you're going to protect me?
You only have one hand.

34:14.396 --> 34:18.764
You're right.
You're right.

34:18.799 --> 34:21.969
We'll start looking.
Put it on the market.

34:25.606 --> 34:27.540
You'd really do that for me?

34:27.574 --> 34:30.444
Maybe we're not cut out
to be pioneers.

34:41.955 --> 34:45.123
Sleep in the parlor if you're worried.
I won't wake you.

34:50.029 --> 34:51.329
Hello?

34:51.364 --> 34:54.699
You took a four-year-old
to see "Planet of the Apes"?

34:54.733 --> 34:57.302
He's been having
nightmares all night.

34:57.336 --> 34:58.769
Hold on, hold on.

34:58.804 --> 35:00.472
He wanted to see that.

35:00.506 --> 35:02.240
He doesn't decide that.

35:02.274 --> 35:04.142
Well, Don took his kid.

35:04.176 --> 35:07.344
Don Draper, Father of the Year.

35:07.379 --> 35:09.313
Margaret, honey, he loved it.

35:09.347 --> 35:12.116
Put him on, I'll do Dr. Zaius again.
He laughs like an idiot.

35:12.150 --> 35:14.751
The Forbidden
Zone was once a paradise.

35:14.785 --> 35:16.720
You're not funny, Daddy.

35:16.754 --> 35:19.789
We'll probably have to get rid of
the dog; he's that afraid of fur.

35:21.526 --> 35:23.994
Listen, I saw "The Golem"
when I was his age.

35:24.028 --> 35:25.795
You don't even know
what scary is.

35:25.830 --> 35:27.463
I was fine.
It's not my fault.

35:27.498 --> 35:30.800
Yeah, you're right.
It's my fault.

35:30.835 --> 35:33.102
For letting you talk me
into having a four-year-old

35:33.137 --> 35:34.571
watch another
four-year-old.

35:34.605 --> 35:37.641
Listen to me, young lady,
you calm down this minute.

35:37.675 --> 35:39.441
No, Daddy, you listen to me.

35:39.475 --> 35:41.844
You can keep up your fantasy
of acting like a father,

35:41.878 --> 35:43.445
but your grandfather
days are done.

35:43.479 --> 35:46.448
I'm sorry you're upset.
I'm coming over.

35:46.482 --> 35:48.283
- I'll calm him down.
- <i>No.</i>

35:48.317 --> 35:50.252
And call Mother next time
you want to see him

35:50.286 --> 35:52.487
'cause she has to be there.

36:22.283 --> 36:25.151
- Morning.
- Good morning.

36:25.186 --> 36:26.786
Good to see you.

36:50.144 --> 36:52.879
It's such a project
going to the beach.

36:52.913 --> 36:54.380
Can I go get Kevin?

36:54.414 --> 36:56.082
Let him sleep a little more.

36:56.117 --> 36:58.251
I'd love to get one
of those summer rentals.

36:58.285 --> 37:00.820
Doesn't Pete Campbell
have a beach house?

37:02.089 --> 37:03.656
I wouldn't ask him
for anything.

37:03.690 --> 37:06.191
- Don't you like him?
- It's not that.

37:07.527 --> 37:09.028
Actually,
he's the only person there

37:09.062 --> 37:10.663
who's never broken
a promise to me.

37:10.697 --> 37:12.765
He's a very generous person.

37:12.799 --> 37:15.067
And frankly, I think
he's having a rough time.

37:15.101 --> 37:17.269
So he told you
about his mother?

37:17.303 --> 37:19.737
No, I wish he would have.
What's wrong?

37:19.772 --> 37:22.040
He needs a nurse.

37:22.074 --> 37:24.341
He's not gonna ask you.
He's too ashamed.

37:24.376 --> 37:27.011
She back from the track already?

37:27.046 --> 37:30.048
Ugh, she must have
forgotten her keys.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.518
Oh, hello, Roger.

37:36.988 --> 37:39.389
- Who are you?
- It's me, Bob Benson.

37:39.423 --> 37:41.457
From the office.

37:43.460 --> 37:44.995
What are you doing here?

37:45.029 --> 37:47.430
Oh, I was out shopping

37:47.464 --> 37:50.167
and I realized I had
misplaced some paperwork.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.634
And I, uh--

37:52.669 --> 37:54.403
what are you two doing?

37:54.437 --> 37:56.038
We're leaving for the beach.

37:56.073 --> 37:58.174
- You know what? I should go get the car.
- Good idea.

37:58.208 --> 38:00.242
No, Mr. Sterling
is just leaving.

38:01.912 --> 38:04.013
Roger, I'm sure
this can wait till Monday.

38:04.047 --> 38:07.015
Sure, absolutely.
Sorry about that, Bob.

38:07.049 --> 38:09.283
I guess we're all a little bit
out of context right now.

38:09.318 --> 38:11.119
I take no offense.

38:22.364 --> 38:24.198
Didn't know you were friends.

38:24.232 --> 38:27.134
Some people never stop working.

38:27.168 --> 38:29.636
I'm going to freshen up
and we'll get out of here.

38:34.675 --> 38:37.111
<i>Hey, get off our lawn!</i>

38:59.098 --> 39:01.099
What's going on?

39:01.134 --> 39:03.502
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

39:03.536 --> 39:05.070
Jesus!

39:05.104 --> 39:08.240
Why didn't you say something?

39:08.275 --> 39:10.576
- What do I do?
- Don't pull it out.

39:13.379 --> 39:16.781
- If I don't make it--
- Stop it.

39:16.815 --> 39:20.351
You're going to make it.
He's going to make it.

39:24.390 --> 39:27.457
Look, I don't want you to think
this is about what you did.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.827
It was an accident.
I feel horrible.

39:30.861 --> 39:33.463
No, you're scared.

39:34.865 --> 39:38.034
You're a scared person
who hides behind complacence--

39:38.068 --> 39:39.869
cy.

39:39.904 --> 39:42.138
Save your strength. You're
not making any sense.

39:42.173 --> 39:44.173
I don't know why
I thought you'd be braver.

39:44.207 --> 39:47.075
You're... in advertising.

39:47.110 --> 39:50.413
Don't do this right now.
I said I was sorry.

39:52.282 --> 39:56.251
Your activities are offensive
to my every waking moment.

39:56.286 --> 39:58.287
I'm sorry...

40:00.055 --> 40:02.089
but you'll always be the enemy.

40:04.493 --> 40:06.294
Are you breaking up with me?

40:10.766 --> 40:12.634
Got to hand it to you.

40:14.303 --> 40:16.837
You gave me a great ending
to my article.

40:42.162 --> 40:44.263
Oh, you're back.

40:49.535 --> 40:51.035
Did you have fun?

40:51.070 --> 40:53.372
I missed you.

40:55.174 --> 40:57.576
Well, I miss you all the time.

41:01.180 --> 41:04.782
I don't know when I started
pretending like everything was sunny.

41:11.956 --> 41:14.558
I don't know where you've gone,

41:14.593 --> 41:16.594
but I'm here.

41:18.963 --> 41:22.599
I keep trying to make things
the way they used to be,

41:22.633 --> 41:24.901
but I don't know how.

41:24.935 --> 41:27.103
And maybe that's stupid

41:27.137 --> 41:29.672
or young to think
like that, but...

41:31.975 --> 41:34.277
something has to change.

41:37.414 --> 41:39.147
Megan...

41:45.622 --> 41:47.589
You're right.

41:47.624 --> 41:49.591
I haven't been here.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.654
Roger, please.

42:20.688 --> 42:22.589
Come on, just take it.

42:22.623 --> 42:24.990
They're Lincoln Logs.

42:25.024 --> 42:27.626
I thought maybe he'd build
his mother a house.

42:27.661 --> 42:29.562
You can't drop in
on me like that.

42:29.596 --> 42:31.196
But I want to.

42:31.230 --> 42:34.333
Oh, Roger, I'm so sorry,

42:34.367 --> 42:35.968
but you can't do this.

42:36.002 --> 42:37.369
Why not?

42:37.403 --> 42:39.671
Because it's too confusing.

42:39.705 --> 42:41.873
For Kevin.
You know.

42:41.907 --> 42:45.242
But I'm his father.

42:45.277 --> 42:47.278
No, his father is Greg.

42:47.312 --> 42:48.880
But I'm here.

42:50.649 --> 42:52.617
For now.

42:52.651 --> 42:56.353
But every day Greg
is some hero out there.

42:56.387 --> 42:59.389
And I'd rather him think
that is the man in his life.

42:59.423 --> 43:02.626
Who's gonna watch TV with him?
Bob Bunson?

43:02.660 --> 43:04.695
I just want to be around.

43:04.729 --> 43:07.430
I know you want to.

43:07.465 --> 43:09.700
But I can't count on that.

43:19.710 --> 43:21.677
Thank you for the gift.

43:32.588 --> 43:36.590
Something delicate
has come to my attention.

43:37.659 --> 43:39.160
Have a seat.

43:41.096 --> 43:42.897
I...

43:42.931 --> 43:45.733
I've really debated whether
to bring this up with you

43:45.767 --> 43:49.170
because I don't want to put
you in a strange position

43:49.204 --> 43:53.140
and in the end
it's probably just gossip.

43:56.677 --> 43:58.412
It's come to my attention

43:58.446 --> 44:01.348
that you may be in need
of a nurse for your mother.

44:01.382 --> 44:03.650
Joan had no right
to tell you that.

44:05.053 --> 44:07.086
His name is Manolo Colón.

44:07.120 --> 44:09.688
He's an army-trained
registered nurse

44:09.722 --> 44:11.490
and he's available now
only because

44:11.525 --> 44:14.060
he's brought my father
back to full health.

44:18.331 --> 44:21.167
Is he Spanish from Spain?
Because otherwise Mother will refuse.

44:21.201 --> 44:23.435
He's very well-bred.

44:26.638 --> 44:29.006
And don't blame Joan.

44:29.041 --> 44:30.675
She was concerned about you

44:30.709 --> 44:32.743
and had exhausted her resources

44:32.778 --> 44:34.512
and is well aware
that your well-being

44:34.547 --> 44:36.614
is also an interest of mine.

44:48.126 --> 44:49.226
Good morning.

44:49.260 --> 44:51.661
- Is he in?
- Yes, just a minute.

44:51.696 --> 44:53.730
It's okay.

44:56.166 --> 44:58.734
Hi.
Good morning.

44:58.768 --> 45:00.769
Good morning.

45:00.804 --> 45:03.706
I just wanted to--

45:03.740 --> 45:05.908
I needed to talk to you.

45:07.611 --> 45:09.378
Peggy, what's wrong?

45:11.214 --> 45:13.982
I...

45:14.016 --> 45:16.050
Abe got stabbed.

45:16.085 --> 45:18.620
My goodness. Is he okay?
What happened?

45:18.654 --> 45:20.788
He's going to be fine.

45:22.258 --> 45:23.758
But it's over.

45:26.228 --> 45:27.928
We're done.

45:31.399 --> 45:35.744
I'm sorry to hear that.

45:36.160 --> 45:38.394
You are?

45:39.896 --> 45:42.064
You'll find someone else.

45:42.098 --> 45:44.999
And whoever he is,
he's lucky to have you.

45:48.704 --> 45:50.472
Thank you.

45:50.506 --> 45:52.274
You ready to get to work?

45:52.308 --> 45:53.675
Excuse me?

45:53.709 --> 45:56.478
It's Monday morning, Peggy.
Brand-new week.

46:02.651 --> 46:05.519
Morning.
How was your weekend?

46:05.554 --> 46:07.621
How'd it go with Fleischmann's?

46:07.656 --> 46:10.224
They just called.
Full speed ahead.

46:10.258 --> 46:12.259
Good work.

46:14.062 --> 46:15.662
