00:33.657 --> 00:34.924
I hate to tell you this,

00:34.992 --> 00:36.659
but he does not want to be
a doctor when he grows up.

00:36.727 --> 00:39.295
He let me know this morning he
would like to be a mail carrier.

00:39.806 --> 00:41.030
From a doctor to a mail carrier.

00:41.098 --> 00:43.032
Who works for the Pony Express.

00:44.268 --> 00:45.368
Wait a minute.

00:45.436 --> 00:46.803
Were there any ghosts
involved in this last night?

00:46.870 --> 00:48.604
No, we were just watching
an old western on tv.

00:48.672 --> 00:50.273
You know what, not
everything is paranormal.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.808
Some things are just normal.

00:51.875 --> 00:53.643
Not usually between the two of us.

00:53.711 --> 00:58.114
Come on, it's heartburn from
that damn keen-wa stir-fry.

00:58.182 --> 01:00.550
Your little health nut friend
better start working on his English.

01:00.617 --> 01:02.919
I told him "no peppers,"
not "mo' peppers."

01:02.986 --> 01:05.621
Ray, I know you scarfed a
foot-long from the street cart.

01:05.689 --> 01:07.156
There's mustard on your tie.

01:07.224 --> 01:08.891
What is Eli's dad doing here?

01:08.959 --> 01:09.892
Mr. James?

01:09.960 --> 01:11.227
What? Melanie?

01:11.295 --> 01:12.562
What the hell are you doing here?

01:12.629 --> 01:14.731
Melinda. This is my
husband. He's a doctor here.

01:14.798 --> 01:16.632
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine.

01:16.700 --> 01:19.235
I mean Case here's worked up
over a bout of indigestion.

01:19.303 --> 01:21.237
- It's nothing.
- He's having trouble breathing,

01:21.305 --> 01:22.405
Chest pains.

01:22.473 --> 01:24.040
Feeling any numbness in your left arm

01:24.108 --> 01:25.174
or any pain in your jaw?

01:25.242 --> 01:27.176
Of course I'm numb and in pain.
I'm old.

01:27.244 --> 01:29.946
But I'm leaving here before you
charge me for talking to you.

01:30.013 --> 01:31.748
Mr. James, you could be
having a heart attack, ok?

01:31.815 --> 01:33.649
An actual coronary.
I need a wheelchair.

01:33.717 --> 01:35.251
Look, my coronary is fine.

01:35.319 --> 01:38.588
I just need to get back on
the "shut up, Casey" diet.

01:38.655 --> 01:40.690
The only reason I do it is
so she'll stop nagging me.

01:40.758 --> 01:42.258
I pay her to keep the books,

01:42.326 --> 01:45.928
Not harass me every time
I look longingly at...

01:45.996 --> 01:47.096
A damn French...

01:47.164 --> 01:48.464
Mr. James?

01:48.532 --> 01:49.832
It's gas.

01:49.900 --> 01:50.933
Everybody, stand back.

01:53.470 --> 01:55.404
Wait a minute. We need
a cardio work-up now.

01:55.472 --> 01:57.907
Mr. James,
you're gonna be all right.

01:57.975 --> 01:59.542
- Go, go. Take her.
- Casey!

01:59.610 --> 02:00.743
We'll look after him.

02:00.811 --> 02:02.173
I got your message.
What's going on?

02:02.173 --> 02:03.746
Your dad might be having a heart attack.

02:03.814 --> 02:05.581
- Dad!
- Don't "dad" me.

02:05.649 --> 02:07.283
It's not a heart attack.
I just need a bromo.

02:07.351 --> 02:10.419
He came into the shop after
lunch complaining of chest pains.

02:10.487 --> 02:12.522
He should have retired years ago.

02:12.589 --> 02:13.473
Are you kidding me?

02:13.473 --> 02:16.651
The screen door king's not
abdicating anytime soon.

02:16.651 --> 02:17.960
Hi. Um, I'm Casey.

02:18.028 --> 02:19.962
My mom and Eli's dad
are business partners.

02:20.030 --> 02:21.697
Right.
We met at the grand reopening.

02:21.765 --> 02:23.099
God, I sure hope he's ok.

02:23.167 --> 02:24.667
He's fine. Excuse me.

02:24.735 --> 02:26.903
Now, come on,
take your mind off it.

02:35.612 --> 02:36.946
You're Eli's mom.

02:37.014 --> 02:38.281
Evelyn.

02:38.348 --> 02:41.083
I'm sorry. I've never
been very good at charades.

02:41.151 --> 02:42.418
I don't understand.

02:42.486 --> 02:44.844
Eli told me that you died 7 years ago.

02:44.844 --> 02:46.255
We both thought you went into the light.

02:46.323 --> 02:48.491
Nope, not me. Not yet.

02:48.559 --> 02:50.278
Well, if there's
something keeping you here,

02:50.278 --> 02:51.190
you know that Eli can help.

02:51.190 --> 02:52.929
I mean, did you know
that he can hear you?

02:52.996 --> 02:55.097
Oh, yes.
People gossip on this side,

02:55.165 --> 02:57.400
And I check in on him from time to time,

02:57.467 --> 03:00.870
But you never know what
you might pop in on, so.

03:00.938 --> 03:02.972
Well, haven't you ever
wanted to talk to him?

03:03.040 --> 03:04.740
Of course I have.

03:04.808 --> 03:07.643
But what man wants to
be haunted by his mother?

03:07.711 --> 03:09.445
Besides, I need your help.

03:09.513 --> 03:11.714
Ok, but Eli's your son.

03:11.782 --> 03:12.934
I mean, it might be
good for both of you...

03:12.934 --> 03:15.144
It's not for me.
It's for Ray.

03:15.144 --> 03:16.519
He's not well, you know.

03:16.587 --> 03:18.921
He's going to be on this side soon.

03:18.989 --> 03:21.636
Very soon.

03:22.226 --> 03:23.226
I should call my mom.

03:23.293 --> 03:25.094
That's gonna be really hard for Eli.

03:25.162 --> 03:26.596
Exactly.

03:28.064 --> 03:30.266
And he'll want to help his father.

03:30.334 --> 03:32.168
That's the kind of man he is.

03:32.236 --> 03:34.737
But that wouldn't be the brightest idea.

03:34.805 --> 03:36.172
The two of them have never real...

03:36.240 --> 03:37.773
Oh, no.

03:39.369 --> 03:40.443
Cut the chit-chat.

03:40.510 --> 03:42.111
Let's get the hell out of here, huh.

03:42.179 --> 03:43.779
Come on,
I'm as fit as a fiddle now.

03:43.847 --> 03:45.748
Let's go. Chop-chop.

03:45.816 --> 03:46.949
What's wrong?

03:47.017 --> 03:49.685
I think my dad's... dead.

03:49.753 --> 03:51.153
You don't know that.

03:51.221 --> 03:53.289
What the hell?

03:56.493 --> 03:57.860
Eli,

03:57.928 --> 04:00.798
Your dad went into full arrest
while he was being evaluated.

04:00.798 --> 04:03.165
We did everything we could.

04:03.233 --> 04:04.867
I'm so sorry, Eli.

04:04.935 --> 04:07.036
Oh, my god.

04:07.104 --> 04:09.338
Oh, Eli.

04:09.406 --> 04:11.007
Wait.

04:11.074 --> 04:13.935
I'm... I'm dead?

04:13.935 --> 04:16.212
But I'm still here?

04:16.279 --> 04:18.769
That's usually how it works.

04:18.949 --> 04:20.182
What?

04:20.250 --> 04:21.416
Eli.

04:21.485 --> 04:23.052
Ok, smart guy.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.887
If you know so much about death,

04:24.955 --> 04:27.022
Where the hell is your mother?

04:27.328 --> 04:31.027
Get him into the light.
Fast. Soon. Now.

04:31.094 --> 04:32.361
Well, can't you help me?

04:32.429 --> 04:33.529
I mean, Eli's your son.

04:33.597 --> 04:34.597
He just lost his father.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.832
Oh, no. Just please,
handle it.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.101
And as far as our little chat,

04:39.169 --> 04:41.086
I was never here.

05:26.692 --> 05:27.894
You want some more wine?

05:27.961 --> 05:30.029
No, thanks.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.531
I have to go home tonight,

05:32.227 --> 05:33.833
Start reading dad's will,

05:33.901 --> 05:35.234
planning his funeral.

05:35.302 --> 05:37.782
I'm still shocked he trusted
me to be the executor.

05:37.904 --> 05:39.872
I take it you two didn't get along?

05:39.940 --> 05:41.374
Not exactly.

05:41.442 --> 05:44.410
Dad wanted me to be the
next Screen Door King,

05:44.478 --> 05:46.479
Not some touchy-feely shrink.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.181
He thought I was a flake.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.983
The last couple of years we barely
spoke since I told him about the ghosts.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.318
He didn't believe you?

05:52.386 --> 05:54.120
He wanted me to prove
it by talking to my mom,

05:54.188 --> 05:55.254
But she's gone.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.823
And now he's off looking for her.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.658
What did he say right
before he disappeared?

05:58.725 --> 06:00.626
Just that he wanted to see my mom.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.396
I tried to tell him that she's
already waiting for him in the light.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.831
He never listens to me.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.899
Anyway, I guess I should call Case.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.501
She said she'd help with everything.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.502
Hey, what's the story with that?

06:09.570 --> 06:10.762
You guys had a major vibe going on.

06:10.762 --> 06:11.897
Yeah, but what's the point?

06:11.897 --> 06:14.044
Every woman I've dated
the past 6 years bolts

06:14.044 --> 06:15.975
as soon as I bring up the ghosts.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.678
Hey, there might be
one that surprises you.

06:18.745 --> 06:19.679
Easy for you to say.

06:19.746 --> 06:20.813
Baby, what are you working on?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.115
Aw, is that you and your daddy?

06:22.182 --> 06:25.184
It's Uncle Eli and his dad at a lake.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.120
And this is the cabin.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.689
We used to have a house at the lake.

06:29.756 --> 06:32.792
Spent every summer up there
with Casey and her folks.

06:32.860 --> 06:33.960
What's that?

06:38.232 --> 06:40.233
I think it means "stop."

06:40.741 --> 06:45.000
Aiden, the sitter said that
you started this before school.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.441
I thought Uncle Eli might be sad today.

06:49.062 --> 06:52.096
Ok. Um, why don't we finish
it in the morning? Right?

06:52.096 --> 06:53.846
And for now,
brush those teeth.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.425
Come on, little man.
Oh. It's the time.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.786
Don't you find that creepy?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.955
How did he know I had a lake house?

07:03.023 --> 07:05.658
The same way that he thought
you were gonna be sad,

07:05.726 --> 07:08.628
- He knew your dad was sick.
- Spooky.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.600
My mother died up there... aneurysm.

07:14.668 --> 07:17.203
Dad found her on the bathroom floor,

07:17.271 --> 07:19.205
Sold the place right after.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.974
Were things good between
your parents when she passed?

07:22.042 --> 07:23.009
Who knows?

07:23.076 --> 07:24.582
But obviously,
she was at peace,

07:24.582 --> 07:27.013
Or otherwise, she'd be hanging
around here. Why do you ask?

07:27.080 --> 07:29.615
I was just wondering. What
about your mom's family?

07:29.683 --> 07:32.218
- Any issues there?
- My mom's family?

07:32.286 --> 07:35.221
None that I'm aware of. Why?

07:35.289 --> 07:38.958
Uh, it's just, you know,
covering all the bases.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.873
I just lost my father,
sort of,

07:44.025 --> 07:46.646
and you're asking about my mom?

07:48.033 --> 07:50.002
She came to me this afternoon.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.005
My mother? She's still
here? What did she say?

07:53.073 --> 07:56.107
Just that she wanted me to help
your father go into the light.

07:56.108 --> 07:59.378
But look, she really didn't seem
like she wanted to go with him. So...

07:59.446 --> 08:01.314
Wait, wait. What? Why not?

08:01.381 --> 08:04.150
I don't know. I don't know,
but I'll figure it out,

08:04.218 --> 08:06.219
And I'll get them to
cross over, ok? I promise.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.654
Evelyn's still here?

08:08.722 --> 08:11.324
Heh. I guess that's another
thing you got wrong, boy, huh?

08:11.391 --> 08:13.603
Ok. You know what? Mr.
James, really, If you could...

08:13.604 --> 08:17.376
Oh, no, no. I spent all day looking
for a damn light. Thanks to you.

08:17.376 --> 08:19.665
And now I find out that
she's still hanging around?

08:19.733 --> 08:24.604
No, I gotta find her.
Evelyn? Evelyn!

08:24.671 --> 08:26.405
Feel free to retract your offer.

08:31.724 --> 08:33.578
It's almost like he's still here.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.818
Not at the moment.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.254
Look, I don't even
know if I can do this.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.923
Ok, come on. Let's just
find his suit and go. Ok?

08:43.991 --> 08:46.859
I'll even take it by the
funeral home if you want.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.128
You're the best.

08:52.232 --> 08:55.968
The doctor told him he should
stop drinking. Typical dad.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.238
Yeah, he still had one Manhattan
a day. Said he liked the ritual.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.474
Well, then I say we
have one in his honor.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.942
Might make this a little bit easier.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.011
I like the way you think.

09:06.728 --> 09:10.483
So, uh, is your girlfriend
coming to the funeral?

09:10.550 --> 09:13.252
Oh, that'll be a little bit
hard since she's nonexistent

09:13.320 --> 09:15.321
Oh, you... you broke up?

09:16.356 --> 09:19.292
16 times. 16 different women.

09:19.359 --> 09:22.185
Really?
Your dad said you were

09:22.186 --> 09:24.096
seeing somebody pretty seriously
for the past few years.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.465
Well, then he's confusing me
with the son he wish he had.

09:26.950 --> 09:31.637
Or ignoring the one that he
did, mm-mmm, terminally single.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.172
How about you?

09:33.240 --> 09:36.142
Dad said you're engaged
to some airline pilot?

09:36.209 --> 09:40.226
Chad? Uh, no.

09:40.226 --> 09:42.381
Turns out he had a
girl in every airport.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.116
Plus, that was ages ago.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.185
I mean, I've been out
a couple times since,

09:46.253 --> 09:49.288
But... Ray must have been confused.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.325
Or something. Here you go.

09:54.461 --> 09:57.299
To the screen door king

09:57.299 --> 10:00.266
and to seeing you again.

10:04.614 --> 10:06.558
They seem like such a happy family.

10:06.696 --> 10:09.799
As happy as anybody, I guess.

10:09.866 --> 10:12.015
And, uh, this one was
taken at the lake house?

10:12.015 --> 10:14.837
Our two families spent a lot
of time up there back then.

10:14.905 --> 10:17.807
And that is our Casey and Eli.

10:17.874 --> 10:19.475
Those two loved going up there.

10:19.543 --> 10:20.876
When Ray and Evelyn bought it,

10:20.944 --> 10:21.977
He made all the screen doors,

10:22.045 --> 10:24.113
And I said they were
good enough to sell.

10:24.181 --> 10:26.916
Don's the one who suggested
we start a business.

10:26.983 --> 10:28.050
The four of you?

10:28.118 --> 10:30.386
Oh, no, no, no. This
was all Ray and Anne's.

10:30.454 --> 10:32.421
I'm retired. Public Defender.

10:32.489 --> 10:36.158
Don worked such long hours, and
I needed something to do, so.

10:36.226 --> 10:38.623
- This is Eli's mom?
- Yes, Evelyn.

10:38.623 --> 10:40.663
She passed away before we met.

10:40.730 --> 10:43.532
She was a lovely person.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.968
So I've gathered.

10:46.036 --> 10:48.437
Look, this is gonna sound
like a strange question,

10:48.505 --> 10:49.756
But was there any reason that

10:49.757 --> 10:52.975
she would have been angry with
her husband before she died?

10:53.043 --> 10:54.944
That is a strange question.

10:55.011 --> 10:58.047
It's just that Eli's been so
torn up about the whole thing.

10:58.114 --> 11:00.716
And last night he
was... he was wondering

11:00.784 --> 11:02.117
If his parents are together now.

11:02.818 --> 11:04.220
Why wouldn't they be?

11:04.287 --> 11:06.956
I mean, if you believe
in that sort of stuff.

11:07.023 --> 11:11.660
Of course. Um, sorry
to have bothered you.

11:11.728 --> 11:13.496
And I'm sorry for your loss.

11:18.935 --> 11:22.938
That's the screen door that
Ray made for the lake house.

11:25.345 --> 11:26.809
Anne, where are you?

11:26.877 --> 11:29.912
I'm sorry, Don. I'm stuck
at the shop a few more hours.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.833
Ray!

11:34.652 --> 11:36.885
Are you ok?

11:37.892 --> 11:40.872
Yeah. I'm fine.

11:41.324 --> 11:43.893
Thank you for your time.

11:49.733 --> 11:51.166
What are you looking for?

11:51.234 --> 11:53.202
My dad's favorite cufflinks.

11:53.270 --> 11:55.337
The ones with the little
screen doors on them.

11:58.408 --> 12:02.211
Oh, that's so pretty.
Was that your mom's?

12:02.279 --> 12:04.547
I guess.
I've never seen it before.

12:04.614 --> 12:08.517
Who knew my dad was so sentimental?

12:10.965 --> 12:12.721
Remember this song?

12:12.789 --> 12:14.356
How could I forget?

12:24.701 --> 12:26.435
Eighth grade.

12:56.900 --> 13:01.748
What in the Sam Hill are you
two monkeys doing? Knock it off.

13:15.630 --> 13:17.419
I guess you never learned to dance.

13:18.167 --> 13:19.171
No,

13:22.542 --> 13:24.526
but I did learn how to kiss.

13:36.439 --> 13:37.473
That was weird.

13:38.101 --> 13:40.075
Yeah, it's like my dad all over again.

13:40.143 --> 13:41.777
My damn corpse is still warm,

13:41.845 --> 13:44.947
and you're already drinking
my liquor and making moves.

13:45.015 --> 13:46.749
How about a little respect for the dead?

13:46.816 --> 13:47.950
I do respect you.

13:48.596 --> 13:52.321
I respect you, too. I...
are you ok?

13:52.796 --> 13:54.356
Yeah, I just got to...

13:54.424 --> 13:56.258
I gotta find my dad's good tie

13:56.326 --> 13:57.793
So we can get out of here.

13:58.666 --> 14:01.497
Eli, where are you? Call me.

14:01.564 --> 14:04.433
You're not nearly as
trustworthy as they say.

14:04.501 --> 14:07.403
I asked you to get Ray into the light,

14:07.470 --> 14:09.238
not put your nose
where it doesn't belong.

14:09.305 --> 14:10.606
I'm trying to help both of you.

14:10.674 --> 14:11.740
If you could just talk to your husband.

14:11.808 --> 14:13.609
Oh, no. I gave him my life,

14:13.677 --> 14:15.344
I'm not giving him my afterlife, too.

14:15.412 --> 14:17.012
Look, is it because of
what happened with Anne?

14:17.080 --> 14:18.580
I had a vision.

14:18.648 --> 14:21.283
I know about Ray's affair
with her. I guess you do, too.

14:21.351 --> 14:23.452
Eli and his father have enough issues

14:23.520 --> 14:25.120
without you stirring the pot.

14:25.188 --> 14:26.622
You stayed in your marriage

14:26.690 --> 14:28.791
even when you knew, right?

14:28.858 --> 14:31.860
You wouldn't have done that if you
didn't love your husband and your son.

14:31.928 --> 14:33.796
A mother protects her family.

14:33.863 --> 14:35.497
You of all people
should understand that.

14:35.565 --> 14:37.633
Now, please, I'm begging you,

14:37.701 --> 14:39.435
leave it alone.

14:57.126 --> 14:58.852
So now he's haunting you?

14:58.852 --> 15:00.132
All day.

15:01.670 --> 15:03.071
Something's going on.

15:03.139 --> 15:04.973
He's trying to come
between Casey and me.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.675
It turns out he's been lying
to us both all these years,

15:07.743 --> 15:10.311
making up relationships
to keep us apart.

15:10.379 --> 15:11.813
I mean, why would he do that?

15:11.881 --> 15:14.616
And then I found this
stashed in his trinket box.

15:16.218 --> 15:17.643
Was it your mom's?

15:17.643 --> 15:19.387
That's the thing,
I don't know.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.165
Anne, where are you?

15:21.223 --> 15:24.626
I'm sorry, Don. I'm stuck
at the shop a few more hours.

15:30.032 --> 15:32.033
You just got a hit.
What is it?

15:32.101 --> 15:35.215
American. Platinum and gold.

15:35.215 --> 15:37.038
Probably from about 40 years ago.

15:37.106 --> 15:38.840
Spare me the antiques roadshow.

15:38.908 --> 15:40.241
You know something,
don't you?

15:40.309 --> 15:41.643
I don't... I don't think
you're gonna like it.

15:41.710 --> 15:44.860
I'm a shrink.
I think I can handle it.

15:45.381 --> 15:47.048
Your father...

15:47.116 --> 15:49.417
I think he had an affair.

15:53.556 --> 15:55.423
It's platinum, huh?

15:55.491 --> 15:56.991
Think it's worth anything?

15:57.059 --> 16:00.328
I'm sorry that I had to tell you this.

16:01.664 --> 16:03.498
Dad?

16:03.566 --> 16:05.066
My dad was cheating on my...

16:05.134 --> 16:06.301
On your mom.

16:06.368 --> 16:08.303
Maybe that's why she
didn't want to see him.

16:08.370 --> 16:10.171
But why doesn't she want to see me?

16:10.239 --> 16:14.178
And what right does he have to
interfere with my love life?

16:14.553 --> 16:15.577
It gets worse?

16:15.644 --> 16:17.111
A lot.

16:17.179 --> 16:20.281
Um, I think that the
affair was with Casey's mom.

16:20.349 --> 16:21.616
Anne?

16:21.684 --> 16:24.052
Oh, god. Kill me.

16:24.119 --> 16:26.154
Casey's mom? When?

16:26.222 --> 16:27.660
I'm pretty sure it's
before you were born,

16:27.660 --> 16:29.244
but I think that's why he doesn't
want you to see each other

16:29.244 --> 16:30.465
because there is a chance...

16:30.465 --> 16:31.777
Chance of what?

16:31.777 --> 16:33.661
Well, if the affair
was with Casey's mom.

16:33.729 --> 16:35.730
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:35.798 --> 16:38.366
You're saying that
Casey could be my sister?

16:38.434 --> 16:39.467
It's possible.

16:39.535 --> 16:40.602
Technically she would
be your half sister.

16:40.669 --> 16:42.024
But you probably
shouldn't be dating her.

16:43.906 --> 16:45.807
It's Casey. Oh, my god.

16:45.875 --> 16:47.041
Ok, all right. Stop.

16:47.109 --> 16:50.845
Look, at least we know
why they're stuck here.

16:50.913 --> 16:52.413
Right, and if they don't
want to talk about it,

16:52.481 --> 16:55.450
Then there's someone who might.

16:55.517 --> 16:57.919
I'm not gonna give her the choice.

16:59.388 --> 17:02.290
I can't believe Anne did that to my mom.

17:02.358 --> 17:03.725
Her best friend.

17:03.792 --> 17:05.126
I can't wait to get her cornered.

17:05.194 --> 17:06.261
I'm just gonna like...

17:06.328 --> 17:08.563
Why don't you just let
me do the talking, ok?

17:08.631 --> 17:10.565
Oh, you're dad's here on the steps.

17:11.416 --> 17:12.901
What are you doing here?

17:12.968 --> 17:14.602
Are you spying on your mistress?

17:14.670 --> 17:15.670
Watching her take a shower?

17:15.738 --> 17:16.811
- Eli.
- What?

17:16.811 --> 17:19.040
Leave it to Dr. Phil to
get it wrong again, huh?

17:19.108 --> 17:20.742
I'm looking for my wife.

17:20.809 --> 17:21.790
Oh, cut the crap.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.328
I know all about what happened

17:23.328 --> 17:25.012
And what went on with you
and your little girl...

17:25.079 --> 17:27.548
Oh, hi, Mr. Sullivan.

17:27.616 --> 17:29.384
Are you ok?

17:29.451 --> 17:30.885
Why are you shouting?

17:31.870 --> 17:34.989
Melinda just said something that
I took the wrong way. Sorry.

17:35.057 --> 17:36.557
I overreacted.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.026
I forgive you.

17:38.093 --> 17:39.327
Thanks.

17:39.395 --> 17:42.330
Um, we actually just
came to speak with Anne.

17:42.398 --> 17:44.065
Oh, well, she's not home.

17:44.133 --> 17:45.163
What's going on?

17:45.163 --> 17:47.402
Why don't you ask him
the same question, huh?

17:47.469 --> 17:49.370
Better yet, ask casanova here

17:49.438 --> 17:52.541
- About the time I kicked his
butt into next week. - What?

17:52.542 --> 17:54.981
You know what, maybe we
could just talk to you.

17:54.981 --> 17:58.146
- Is he ok?
- He just needs a minute.

17:59.448 --> 18:01.282
I didn't want to tell you this, Eli,

18:01.350 --> 18:06.054
But I caught Don and your mother...

18:06.121 --> 18:08.856
up at the lake house.

18:08.924 --> 18:11.192
I confronted him.
It got pretty ugly.

18:13.491 --> 18:15.196
What's wrong with you, huh? Ray.

18:15.264 --> 18:17.198
Why would you do this to me, huh?

18:17.266 --> 18:19.100
- Why?
- Ray!

18:19.168 --> 18:20.568
Ray! Relax.

18:20.636 --> 18:21.669
What's wrong...

18:27.109 --> 18:31.972
So go on, ask him how he
got that scar on his hand.

18:34.049 --> 18:35.350
Mom?

18:36.852 --> 18:39.754
My mom?

18:39.822 --> 18:41.622
What... what about her?

18:42.472 --> 18:43.891
Are you two ok?

18:43.959 --> 18:46.427
You know what, this is
gonna be incredibly awkward,

18:46.495 --> 18:49.364
But I think Eli here has some questions.

18:49.431 --> 18:50.932
Come on. Come on, sit down.

18:52.904 --> 18:54.669
You and my dad got in
some big fight, right?

18:54.737 --> 18:57.105
That's how you got that
scar on your hand, right?

18:57.172 --> 18:58.506
How do you know that?

18:58.574 --> 18:59.674
Did Ray tell you?

18:59.742 --> 19:01.476
Why don't you?

19:01.543 --> 19:04.712
Eli, your dad was a good man.

19:04.780 --> 19:06.848
And he loved your mother to a fault.

19:06.915 --> 19:08.349
To a fault?

19:10.019 --> 19:11.853
Well, he was jealous.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.188
And while Ray and Anne were
building up the business,

19:14.256 --> 19:16.184
He got in his head that

19:16.184 --> 19:19.060
something was going on
between your mother and me.

19:19.128 --> 19:20.728
Was there something going on?

19:23.032 --> 19:25.633
I let it go a long time ago.

19:25.701 --> 19:28.654
And you should, too. Just
let them rest in peace.

19:28.654 --> 19:30.671
The thing is they can't.

19:30.739 --> 19:32.774
Look, I know that you're gonna
find this hard to believe,

19:32.841 --> 19:34.409
But I have a gift.

19:34.476 --> 19:36.155
And so does Eli.

19:36.155 --> 19:38.780
I can see ghosts and he can hear them.

19:38.847 --> 19:40.982
My parents spirits are still here.

19:41.050 --> 19:43.718
They can't move on until we
clear up what really happened.

19:47.389 --> 19:48.616
Look,

19:48.616 --> 19:52.827
I know what happens to a
person when they're grieving.

19:52.895 --> 19:54.262
Yes, but it's...
It's not that.

19:54.329 --> 19:56.764
Look, yesterday I
touched that screen door

19:56.832 --> 19:59.167
And I saw Ray at the lake house.

19:59.234 --> 20:02.870
And then your wife calling
you with a bunch of excuses.

20:02.938 --> 20:03.871
Wearing this.

20:03.939 --> 20:05.640
Will you two listen to me?

20:05.707 --> 20:07.041
Evelyn admitted it.

20:07.109 --> 20:08.342
He's lying.

20:08.410 --> 20:10.344
Mom admitted it?

20:10.412 --> 20:13.815
That's between your parents.

20:15.350 --> 20:16.851
And with all due respect, Melinda,

20:16.919 --> 20:19.187
I don't know what some screen
door may have told you,

20:19.254 --> 20:22.623
but I'm telling you,
don't dredge up the past.

20:22.691 --> 20:24.559
Too late for that.

20:24.626 --> 20:27.061
Good-bye.

20:27.129 --> 20:30.679
You two are pathetic.

20:31.233 --> 20:34.335
Look, I don't know who had an
affair with whatever or whoever.

20:34.403 --> 20:35.736
It's all T.M.I.

20:35.804 --> 20:37.714
I mean, what's next,
car key parties,

20:37.715 --> 20:38.929
wife swapping?

20:38.929 --> 20:40.408
Maybe.

20:40.476 --> 20:42.176
Somebody's lying. And
whoever was cheating...

20:42.244 --> 20:45.313
I know, I know. Casey
could still be my sister.

20:45.380 --> 20:47.448
But only by half.

20:49.785 --> 20:51.819
You sleep, little baby.

20:51.887 --> 20:55.456
We've got to help your uncle Eli.

20:55.524 --> 20:57.558
Where did you see that red shape?

21:30.716 --> 21:31.783
You know,
you're a really good friend.

21:32.242 --> 21:34.310
Thanks for calling.

21:34.377 --> 21:36.345
That was Delia.

21:36.413 --> 21:38.028
They were gonna take the red eye

21:38.028 --> 21:39.287
after their cousin's wedding,

21:39.287 --> 21:40.950
But I convinced her not to.

21:41.868 --> 21:45.230
Ok, You have the look.
I'm scared.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.504
I've got some not so good news.

21:47.504 --> 21:48.857
Give me a second.

21:49.893 --> 21:51.627
Ok, hit me.

21:51.695 --> 21:52.594
All right.

21:52.594 --> 21:55.192
First off, Aiden's
drawing is not a stop sign,

21:55.192 --> 21:57.303
It is a bathroom tile covered in blood.

21:57.303 --> 21:59.034
The coroner said mom died of an aneurysm

21:59.102 --> 22:00.753
and hit her head on
the sink when she fell.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.802
Yeah, I know, but I had
a vision about her death,

22:02.802 --> 22:04.112
And she wasn't alone.

22:04.429 --> 22:05.596
She wasn't?

22:05.664 --> 22:07.104
Whoever it was,
they just left her.

22:07.104 --> 22:09.934
You mean without helping her
or even calling an ambulance?

22:10.002 --> 22:11.269
Well, after they cleaned up.

22:11.336 --> 22:13.604
And there was candles
and flowers in the tub.

22:13.672 --> 22:15.473
Oh, my god.

22:15.540 --> 22:16.561
The affair was still going on.

22:16.561 --> 22:18.229
Don was trying to cover it up.

22:18.585 --> 22:21.106
I didn't see his face, but
whoever it was was wearing gloves.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.008
Like they were cleaning
up a crime scene?

22:23.075 --> 22:24.342
She died of natural causes.

22:24.410 --> 22:25.977
Yeah, I know,
but maybe they fought

22:26.045 --> 22:27.278
And that triggered an aneurysm.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.189
Or maybe he didn't even kill her,

22:29.189 --> 22:31.983
But he just, you know,
panicked afterwards.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.084
Wait a minute. Wait.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.853
What makes you think it wasn't my dad?

22:34.920 --> 22:36.321
I mean, they were married.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.790
And even though it makes my eyes bleed

22:38.858 --> 22:40.525
to think that they went up there to...

22:40.593 --> 22:43.395
Yeah, but why would your dad clean up?

22:46.265 --> 22:47.365
Unless...

22:47.433 --> 22:49.454
Oh, no.

22:49.454 --> 22:50.546
Incoming.

22:50.546 --> 22:51.870
What if he knew it was still going on

22:51.937 --> 22:53.338
and he went to confront her?

22:55.274 --> 22:58.510
Are you suggesting that my dad had
something to do with her death?

22:58.577 --> 23:00.378
That's crazy.

23:00.446 --> 23:02.715
There's got to be some reason
that she doesn't want to see him.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.783
But if he did do it, why
does he want to see her?

23:07.186 --> 23:08.319
It's Casey.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.854
She must have called a dozen times.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.389
You're gonna have to
talk to her eventually.

23:11.457 --> 23:13.425
Not until I find out who's our daddy.

23:13.492 --> 23:16.227
And now thanks to you,
whether or not he's a murderer.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.702
Dad?

23:23.769 --> 23:24.803
Are you here?

23:27.339 --> 23:28.673
Look, it's your funeral today.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.608
You want to be buried in peace, right?

23:31.744 --> 23:32.844
Come on, dad, talk to me.

23:34.135 --> 23:37.627
Ok, but I just don't want to hear
any more of your cockamamie theories,

23:37.627 --> 23:39.036
Ok?

23:42.254 --> 23:44.489
I need to talk to you about mom and Don.

23:44.971 --> 23:47.525
Is that why you've been trying
to keep me and Casey apart,

23:47.593 --> 23:49.360
because you're not sure
that you're my father?

23:49.428 --> 23:53.632
Honestly, I don't know.

23:53.632 --> 23:56.034
Well, that explains why you've
always been so hard on me.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.849
Oh, come on,
don't shrink me, boy.

23:57.849 --> 24:01.312
I raised you the same way
as my old man raised me.

24:01.312 --> 24:03.327
When did you find out Don and mom?

24:03.327 --> 24:04.858
Years ago.

24:04.858 --> 24:06.544
It was before you were born.

24:07.303 --> 24:08.956
Mom said she broke it off?

24:09.128 --> 24:11.274
Yeah. I forgave her.

24:12.669 --> 24:14.865
I need to ask you about
the night she died.

24:14.865 --> 24:17.695
I told you.

24:18.219 --> 24:23.151
Busybody Mrs. Pilnick
called the caretaker

24:23.219 --> 24:25.520
and said she saw the lights on and

24:25.588 --> 24:28.712
mom's car parked out front.

24:28.712 --> 24:33.395
So he called me and I drove up there.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.733
I found her.

24:38.801 --> 24:42.504
She was just lying there.

24:45.041 --> 24:46.387
And then what?

24:46.387 --> 24:48.956
You cleaned up the flowers and candles

24:48.956 --> 24:50.879
so I wouldn't find
out about mom and Ray?

24:50.947 --> 24:52.440
Whoa, what candles and flowers?

24:52.440 --> 24:53.390
Dad, come on.

24:53.390 --> 24:54.864
Maybe you were trying to
protect her reputation.

24:54.864 --> 24:56.318
What the hell are you talking about?

24:56.385 --> 24:58.320
Melinda, she had a vision.
And in the vision...

24:58.320 --> 25:00.445
You mean about the
night your mother died?

25:00.445 --> 25:03.067
Ok, you two, enough.

25:03.859 --> 25:05.093
Evelyn?

25:05.161 --> 25:07.578
Well, you are a sight for dead eyes.

25:07.578 --> 25:08.872
Where have you been?

25:08.872 --> 25:10.314
Mom? It's really you?

25:10.333 --> 25:11.967
It's me.

25:12.035 --> 25:14.470
I'm so sorry to barge
in on you like this,

25:14.537 --> 25:16.639
But really, what's the point
of dredging all this up?

25:16.706 --> 25:17.740
It was so long ago.

25:17.807 --> 25:20.643
What's all this about
candles and flowers?

25:20.710 --> 25:22.111
At my funeral? How nice.

25:22.178 --> 25:23.412
Got to go.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.813
No, you stay put.

25:24.881 --> 25:26.849
Wait a minute.

25:26.916 --> 25:29.158
Candles and flowers.

25:29.610 --> 25:32.800
It was just like the first time
that I caught you two up there.

25:32.800 --> 25:33.922
Please, I'm begging you.

25:33.990 --> 25:36.258
Don and Anne got over
it. We should, too.

25:36.326 --> 25:37.393
Anne knew about it?

25:37.460 --> 25:38.748
None of it was easy.

25:38.748 --> 25:41.196
That snake was with
you the night you died?

25:41.264 --> 25:42.431
And you're still protecting him?

25:42.499 --> 25:43.799
Honestly, it isn't like that.

25:43.867 --> 25:45.234
What is it like then?

25:45.301 --> 25:47.469
We'll talk when you calm down.

25:47.537 --> 25:48.871
Evelyn!

25:48.938 --> 25:49.905
You come back here!

25:49.973 --> 25:51.373
Stop fighting!

25:51.441 --> 25:52.374
I'm sure it was just...

25:52.442 --> 25:53.375
No, no, no.

25:53.443 --> 25:54.443
You're still hanging around, huh,

25:54.511 --> 25:56.245
just waiting for him.

25:56.830 --> 25:59.982
The man who left you for
dead on the bathroom floor.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.818
Fine.

26:03.876 --> 26:06.553
You want your precious Don?

26:07.657 --> 26:10.092
I'll bring him to you.

26:12.796 --> 26:13.962
Dad.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.764
Wait!

26:30.280 --> 26:31.847
Anne?

27:20.997 --> 27:24.099
Please forgive me.

27:24.167 --> 27:25.868
I never meant to hurt you.

27:35.036 --> 27:37.899
My dad was shocked to find out
the affair was still going on.

27:37.962 --> 27:39.507
So he wasn't the one who cleaned up.

27:39.507 --> 27:41.184
Ok, so we're back to Don.

27:41.184 --> 27:42.127
Here me out.

27:42.127 --> 27:44.715
It couldn't have been Mrs.
Pilnick who called the caretaker.

27:44.715 --> 27:46.041
Who's Mrs. Pilnick?

27:46.041 --> 27:47.279
The lake busybody.

27:47.279 --> 27:50.900
Dad said that she had
called the caretaker

27:50.900 --> 27:52.272
who called him the night mom died.

27:52.340 --> 27:53.573
But that was in November.

27:53.641 --> 27:56.362
And Mrs. Pilnick spent
the winters in Boca.

27:56.362 --> 27:59.346
So somebody must have pretended
to be her on the phone.

27:59.414 --> 28:01.214
A woman.

28:01.282 --> 28:03.250
Wait a minute..

28:03.250 --> 28:05.218
There's a blonde in Aiden's drawing.

28:05.286 --> 28:06.720
It's Anne.

28:06.788 --> 28:08.455
Mom said she knew.

28:09.196 --> 28:11.406
Ok, well, did she know
that they started up again?

28:11.406 --> 28:12.478
Makes sense.

28:12.478 --> 28:14.327
She could have went up
there to confront mom.

28:14.395 --> 28:16.278
So they fought,
there was a struggle,

28:16.278 --> 28:18.732
And that brought on the aneurysm.

28:22.236 --> 28:24.571
I don't think my dad got that update.

28:24.638 --> 28:26.339
What? What is it?

28:26.407 --> 28:27.908
Looks like he might have hurt Don.

28:27.908 --> 28:30.543
- There's blood and....
- Blood?

28:30.611 --> 28:32.191
Yeah.

28:32.191 --> 28:34.224
Strawberry.

28:34.224 --> 28:35.882
It's jam.

28:37.418 --> 28:39.035
Somebody's here. I gotta go.

28:39.035 --> 28:40.687
Wait...

28:43.290 --> 28:45.024
Eli, what are you doing here?

28:45.092 --> 28:47.209
Oh, uh, just looking for your
parents. They're not here.

28:47.209 --> 28:48.432
Are you sure? Let me just...

28:48.432 --> 28:50.630
Positive. Yeah.

28:50.698 --> 28:53.215
Well, they didn't answer
their phones, either,

28:53.215 --> 28:54.263
Which is typical.

28:54.263 --> 28:56.870
They must have gone out for
breakfast before the funeral.

28:56.937 --> 28:58.905
Hopefully not a place with knives.

28:58.973 --> 29:00.240
What?

29:00.307 --> 29:03.576
Eli, what...
why are you acting so weird?

29:03.644 --> 29:07.914
Sorry, I just have to give a eulogy

29:07.982 --> 29:10.083
that I haven't written yet.

29:10.394 --> 29:12.087
Yeah, I thought you
wanted my help with that.

29:12.087 --> 29:15.201
You know, I've been
calling and texting you.

29:15.201 --> 29:17.090
Did I do something wrong?

29:17.100 --> 29:19.034
No, of course not. No, no.

29:19.102 --> 29:21.770
God, I'm... I'm such a ditz.

29:21.838 --> 29:23.806
Here you are going
through something so major

29:23.873 --> 29:26.208
and I'm being all selfish
and making it about me.

29:26.276 --> 29:27.509
Sorry.

29:27.577 --> 29:30.512
I must have misread you
the other day, that's all.

29:30.580 --> 29:33.729
And besides, we have
too much history. Right?

29:33.729 --> 29:36.018
I mean, we're practically
brother and sister, so.

29:36.086 --> 29:37.820
Yeah, no.

29:37.887 --> 29:41.156
Trust me, I'm really not trying
to think of you that way.

29:41.224 --> 29:43.959
Um, anyway, we're late.
We should go.

29:44.027 --> 29:45.194
I'll drive. Let's...

29:55.739 --> 29:57.739
Ah, it's his voicemail
again. Where is he?

29:57.740 --> 29:59.174
Maybe he found his parents again.

29:59.241 --> 30:00.341
Hopefully Casey's.

30:00.409 --> 30:01.951
I guess Ray did something drastic.

30:01.951 --> 30:04.273
I checked all the emergency
rooms and the local hospitals.

30:04.273 --> 30:05.640
Neither parent were admitted.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.649
Did you check the morgues?

30:07.716 --> 30:09.823
Ooh, finally.

30:11.620 --> 30:13.488
- Are they here?
- Who, my parents?

30:14.517 --> 30:16.124
Yeah.

30:16.192 --> 30:17.692
Uh, I haven't... I
haven't seen them yet.

30:17.760 --> 30:18.793
Any of them.

30:18.861 --> 30:20.929
Ok, now I'm worried.

30:20.996 --> 30:22.363
You and me both.

30:22.431 --> 30:24.999
We come here today
to honor Raymond James

30:25.067 --> 30:29.420
as he joins his wife
Evelyn in eternal peace.

30:29.420 --> 30:30.772
We should be so lucky.

30:30.840 --> 30:35.378
Their beloved son Eli has
asked to say a few words.

30:35.378 --> 30:36.852
Eli?

30:49.374 --> 30:52.327
What can I say about my dad?

30:52.767 --> 30:57.555
Except that he was larger than life.

30:57.867 --> 30:59.677
Especially when it came to

30:59.678 --> 31:03.902
the way he loved my mom.

31:09.644 --> 31:13.072
You all know my dad was a little crazy.

31:13.749 --> 31:15.783
Love can do that to a person sometimes.

31:15.851 --> 31:20.788
It can make a person
do really stupid things.

31:20.856 --> 31:22.991
But love can be a pain, too,

31:23.058 --> 31:27.806
Because, you know, we can't
choose we fall in love with.

31:29.298 --> 31:30.999
The heart just goes where it goes

31:31.066 --> 31:34.602
and it's not always a
recipe for happiness.

31:34.670 --> 31:38.717
You've got a hell of a nerve showing
your sorry face at my funeral.

31:45.881 --> 31:46.981
My god.

31:48.184 --> 31:49.444
I'm overcome.

31:49.444 --> 31:51.425
- Dad.
- Don, are you ok?

31:51.425 --> 31:53.532
You tell him I'm just getting warmed up.

31:53.532 --> 31:55.390
Stop it!

31:57.693 --> 31:59.727
Jim, could you just stall?

31:59.795 --> 32:01.663
Yeah.

32:02.505 --> 32:04.098
You guys, follow me.

32:05.134 --> 32:07.035
We'll be right back.

32:07.102 --> 32:08.336
Thank you.

32:08.404 --> 32:10.205
Let's go.

32:10.272 --> 32:12.530
Ok, so I didn't believe you
about all this ghost stuff,

32:12.530 --> 32:15.677
But I swear, Ray's been
trying to kill me all morning.

32:15.744 --> 32:19.414
A ghost?
Dad, what's going on?

32:19.481 --> 32:21.249
Make it stop, please.

32:21.317 --> 32:22.584
You can do that, right?

32:22.651 --> 32:24.285
I can try. I mean,
Ray is with us.

32:24.353 --> 32:25.462
What?

32:25.462 --> 32:29.257
Casey, look, Melinda can see
ghosts and I can hear them.

32:29.325 --> 32:30.758
And I know this sounds crazy,

32:30.826 --> 32:32.694
but my parents are stuck here

32:32.761 --> 32:35.165
because you and I might be related.

32:35.165 --> 32:37.232
Is Evelyn here, too?

32:37.299 --> 32:39.133
She is now.

32:39.201 --> 32:40.902
Well, it's about damn time.

32:40.970 --> 32:42.203
I haven't been losing my mind.

32:42.271 --> 32:45.100
She really has been
haunting me all these years.

32:45.100 --> 32:47.008
Yeah, because you left her for dead.

32:47.076 --> 32:48.676
Or maybe you even caused her death

32:48.744 --> 32:50.378
when you confronted
her about the affair.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.247
No, no. Eli, stop it, please.

32:52.314 --> 32:53.314
You have it all wrong.

32:53.382 --> 32:54.812
Affair?

32:54.940 --> 32:57.285
Will somebody please
tell me what's going on?

32:57.285 --> 32:58.987
I told you to leave it alone.

32:59.054 --> 33:00.822
You see the mess you've made.

33:00.889 --> 33:02.189
You don't even deny it,
do you?

33:02.189 --> 33:03.295
How could you do that?

33:03.295 --> 33:05.426
Leave her alone.
She didn't do anything.

33:05.494 --> 33:08.596
- She hurt you, mom.
- No! She was...

33:08.664 --> 33:10.505
Protecting me.

33:10.505 --> 33:13.234
Protecting you from what?

33:15.834 --> 33:17.205
Ray.

33:17.273 --> 33:18.806
What?

33:18.874 --> 33:21.509
I was unfaithful.

33:21.577 --> 33:24.078
But not with Don.

33:26.548 --> 33:27.715
Evelyn.

33:27.783 --> 33:29.817
What are they saying?

33:31.053 --> 33:32.920
Evelyn's confessing.

33:32.988 --> 33:36.324
She was unfaithful,
but not with Don.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.761
She's telling the truth.

33:41.430 --> 33:43.865
I was protecting her.

33:43.932 --> 33:46.434
Because she did have an affair.

33:49.305 --> 33:51.439
With me.

34:05.258 --> 34:07.193
Evelyn.

34:08.395 --> 34:09.762
What the hell is...

34:09.830 --> 34:13.299
I'm so sorry you had
to find out like this.

34:13.367 --> 34:16.335
I lived a lifetime of guilt and shame.

34:16.402 --> 34:18.371
Death gave me perspective.

34:18.438 --> 34:22.108
My only regret is that I deceived you.

34:22.176 --> 34:26.530
- I couldn't love you the way you
deserved. - No, no. That's not possible.

34:26.530 --> 34:30.516
Now, look, I caught you and
Don red-handed. I mean...

34:30.583 --> 34:33.690
No, but I just let you think you did.

34:33.690 --> 34:37.346
Evelyn wanted Ray to think
that the affair was with Don.

34:37.826 --> 34:41.719
Mom, is this real?

34:41.786 --> 34:44.121
It is, sweetie.

34:44.976 --> 34:46.524
Years ago, Evelyn and I...

34:47.542 --> 34:50.884
We'd go up to the lake house
to open it up for the summer.

34:52.697 --> 34:55.288
One thing led to another and

34:55.978 --> 34:57.168
we fell in love.

34:57.236 --> 34:59.704
And that's where you
went to be together?

35:01.107 --> 35:02.607
The night Evvy gave me that necklace,

35:02.675 --> 35:04.676
Ray showed up.

35:04.743 --> 35:07.946
I'm sorry, Don. I'm stuck
at the shop a few more hours.

35:08.761 --> 35:11.082
There's lasagna in the freezer.

35:11.082 --> 35:12.587
Bye.

35:14.890 --> 35:16.421
Ray!

35:16.422 --> 35:19.780
It was Ray coming up
the steps whistling.

35:26.013 --> 35:27.432
Ray?

35:27.500 --> 35:29.258
Evvy?

35:43.782 --> 35:46.417
It all happened so fast.

35:46.485 --> 35:47.986
I saw Ray in my rearview mirror.

35:49.355 --> 35:52.223
And all I saw...

35:52.291 --> 35:54.718
All I saw then was Don's car.

35:54.718 --> 35:57.195
Anne was driving Don's car.

35:57.263 --> 35:58.696
That's why he thought it was him.

35:58.764 --> 36:00.298
And I let him think that.

36:00.366 --> 36:02.867
I could barely handle the truth myself.

36:02.935 --> 36:04.334
How could I expect you to?

36:04.334 --> 36:06.838
Yeah, but look,
Don never denied it.

36:06.906 --> 36:09.841
I mean, why the hell would
he even go along with it?

36:09.909 --> 36:14.479
Don, my father wants to know why
you let him believe it was you.

36:16.882 --> 36:19.951
It's because you knew,
didn't you?

36:21.086 --> 36:22.837
I suspected.

36:23.283 --> 36:24.756
And when Ray accused me,

36:24.823 --> 36:27.392
It just all sort of made sense.

36:30.029 --> 36:32.163
But my family was important then.

36:32.231 --> 36:34.377
And they are now.

36:36.569 --> 36:38.169
I didn't want to lose you.

36:39.196 --> 36:40.505
I felt the same.

36:41.941 --> 36:43.474
So when Evvy died,

36:43.542 --> 36:45.944
I let our secret die with her.

36:46.011 --> 36:47.712
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

36:48.914 --> 36:50.014
Neither did I, Ray.

36:50.779 --> 36:52.875
Especially after the way you reacted.

36:53.519 --> 36:56.688
I'd never seen you so angry.

36:56.755 --> 36:58.957
And even worse, so hurt.

37:01.827 --> 37:03.995
How do you think I feel now?

37:05.898 --> 37:08.539
You were there the night Evelyn died.

37:09.159 --> 37:11.936
A few days before I'd
broken it off again.

37:12.004 --> 37:13.805
Gave her back the necklace.

37:13.872 --> 37:16.341
But then she called
me from the lake house

37:16.408 --> 37:17.342
And I drove up to see her.

37:17.409 --> 37:18.824
I knew I shouldn't.

37:18.824 --> 37:20.511
The thing is,

37:20.579 --> 37:23.781
I died hours before she got there.

37:31.724 --> 37:34.225
I hit my head on the sink when I fell.

37:34.293 --> 37:35.226
Evvy!

37:35.294 --> 37:36.661
Just like the coroner said.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.735
Evvy.

37:43.802 --> 37:46.537
She didn't have a pulse.

37:46.605 --> 37:47.739
Her skin was so cold.

37:47.806 --> 37:49.007
Evvy! Oh, my god.

37:49.074 --> 37:50.341
- She was dead.
- No!

37:50.409 --> 37:51.876
I didn't know what had happened.

37:51.944 --> 37:53.978
I knew that if anybody
found her like that,

37:54.046 --> 37:55.647
with the candles and the flowers...

37:55.714 --> 37:59.250
I panicked. I hid everything.

38:06.925 --> 38:09.394
I hated leaving you like that, Evvy.

38:09.461 --> 38:12.163
I just didn't know what else to do.

38:13.532 --> 38:16.100
Please tell her I'd
have done the same thing.

38:16.168 --> 38:17.402
I was dead.

38:17.469 --> 38:20.305
Why put our families
through anymore pain?

38:20.372 --> 38:22.106
She understands

38:22.174 --> 38:23.808
why you did that.

38:23.876 --> 38:27.445
No wonder you were so
upset when she died.

38:27.513 --> 38:31.416
I thought I was protecting her.

38:31.483 --> 38:34.619
Ray and Eli and you, Casey,
and Don.

38:35.383 --> 38:38.423
I carry that guilt
with me every day since.

38:38.490 --> 38:40.425
But you called the caretaker

38:40.492 --> 38:42.060
so that somebody would find her.

38:42.127 --> 38:46.230
I couldn't bear the thought of her
just lying there dead like that.

38:46.979 --> 38:51.135
So our marriage was just some lie?

38:52.237 --> 38:53.905
It's not that simple.

38:53.972 --> 38:55.773
I just...

38:55.841 --> 38:58.409
I couldn't change who I am.

38:59.511 --> 39:01.179
What is it?
What are they saying?

39:02.581 --> 39:05.149
They have some stuff to figure out.

39:07.152 --> 39:08.519
So do we.

39:10.789 --> 39:13.091
Let's go home.

39:20.265 --> 39:22.233
I do love you, Ray.

39:22.301 --> 39:26.604
So much that I wanted you
to be able to die in peace.

39:26.672 --> 39:28.172
And if there is another life waiting,

39:28.240 --> 39:32.243
I hope to be honest with
myself and the people I love.

39:32.311 --> 39:34.011
What you're saying is that

39:34.079 --> 39:38.149
you could only truly be happy if...

39:38.217 --> 39:40.862
if I would have just stepped aside?

39:40.862 --> 39:42.253
Not this time around.

39:42.321 --> 39:44.822
I wasn't strong enough for that.

39:44.890 --> 39:47.992
But Eli,
you said it yourself,

39:48.760 --> 39:51.628
the heart goes where it goes.

39:52.997 --> 39:54.869
This life is done now.

39:54.869 --> 39:57.461
But I just hope...

39:58.389 --> 40:01.203
Can you ever forgive me?

40:03.494 --> 40:07.196
Honestly, I... I don't know.

40:08.599 --> 40:13.536
But maybe... maybe you
can help me get there.

40:15.506 --> 40:17.307
Maybe.

40:23.847 --> 40:25.315
Oh, my.

40:25.382 --> 40:28.818
It's so beautiful.

40:31.555 --> 40:34.651
Are you ready to say good-bye?

40:35.319 --> 40:37.226
I don't think I can.

40:38.101 --> 40:39.662
What is it, sweetie?

40:41.932 --> 40:44.067
I know that you two have to move on,

40:44.134 --> 40:47.570
and I know some day I'm gonna join you,

40:47.638 --> 40:49.174
But right now,
after all this,

40:49.174 --> 40:52.241
I just feel like there's so
much I don't know about you.

40:52.309 --> 40:53.843
Ray, maybe we should stay.

40:53.911 --> 40:54.877
What?

40:54.945 --> 40:56.717
Well, we can't leave him like this.

40:56.717 --> 40:57.981
Not right now.

40:58.048 --> 40:59.349
He's a grown man.

40:59.416 --> 41:02.267
Mom, don't just stay
because of me. You shouldn't.

41:02.267 --> 41:04.053
What better reason would there be?

41:04.121 --> 41:06.122
Evelyn, we're gonna miss the bus.

41:06.190 --> 41:08.057
The light's fading. Come on.

41:08.125 --> 41:10.026
It'll be back.

41:10.094 --> 41:12.962
And so will we.

41:25.275 --> 41:28.494
I still just can't
believe my mom was gay.

41:28.494 --> 41:30.446
You know, that might not have
been the word she would have used.

41:30.514 --> 41:33.983
I've counseled so many
patients in her situation.

41:34.051 --> 41:36.452
Maybe if she just would have told us.

41:36.520 --> 41:37.754
It would have been hard,

41:37.821 --> 41:39.255
But we would have worked through it.

41:39.323 --> 41:40.490
You still will.

41:40.557 --> 41:42.392
And when they're ready,
they'll move on.

41:42.459 --> 41:45.294
But hey, the good news is you
and Casey can be together.

41:45.362 --> 41:47.363
She still hasn't called.

41:47.431 --> 41:49.465
We're supposed to get
together later for a drink.

41:49.533 --> 41:51.934
You know,
you might want to change.

41:52.002 --> 41:53.903
Why?

41:53.971 --> 41:57.507
I know what'll happen. We'll go
out on a few dates, if I'm lucky.

41:57.574 --> 41:59.676
She'll tell me she's
really starting to like me

41:59.743 --> 42:01.377
and she thinks what a unique guy I am,

42:01.445 --> 42:04.547
but the ghost thing freaks her out.

42:04.615 --> 42:06.282
Not if she's the right person.

42:06.350 --> 42:08.651
We'll see.

42:08.719 --> 42:10.153
Anyway, thanks.

42:13.590 --> 42:15.625
It's Casey. I should...

42:15.693 --> 42:18.594
Hey, Case.

42:18.662 --> 42:21.452
Yeah.

42:21.899 --> 42:24.934
Well, yeah. I like you, too.

42:25.002 --> 42:27.003
A lot. And I...

42:29.239 --> 42:31.374
Unique, huh?

42:33.143 --> 42:34.811
So I've been told.
