WEBVTT

00:07.508 --> 00:09.385
Denny: Hate to say it, Benji,

00:09.593 --> 00:10.593
but...

00:13.055 --> 00:14.807
Ben: Believe me now?

00:14.890 --> 00:15.933
Denny: Oh, my God.

00:20.031 --> 00:21.832
Denny: Look at all those
shiny new Mega-Mechs.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.315
Ben: All waiting in line to gas up.

00:23.399 --> 00:24.483
Rebel skitters were right,

00:24.567 --> 00:25.568
as usual.

00:25.609 --> 00:26.986
If those Mechs
top off their tanks,

00:27.069 --> 00:28.529
we're toast.

00:28.612 --> 00:29.780
It's not just that group,
either.

00:29.822 --> 00:31.115
This plant makes all the fuel

00:31.157 --> 00:32.825
for all the Mechs and Beamers
on the East Coast.

00:32.908 --> 00:35.077
The Fishheads invade our planet,

00:35.161 --> 00:36.245
but they forget to
bring enough fuel?

00:36.328 --> 00:37.496
What's that about?

00:37.538 --> 00:38.778
Ben: We can't worry about that.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.632
Our problem right now
is that the only road in

00:40.708 --> 00:43.002
is guarded by Mechs,
and they're all powered up.

00:43.653 --> 00:45.814
They'll pound us to road kill
if we try to go that way.

00:45.838 --> 00:48.049
Then we'll go
where they won't expect us.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.467
They're not defending
that cliff.

00:54.513 --> 00:57.099
Ben: Those tubes
must contain the fuel.

00:57.141 --> 00:58.309
Denny: Oh, my God.

01:01.604 --> 01:03.064
Denny: You think it's
the radiation?

01:08.986 --> 01:10.362
Ben: It could have been us.

01:20.331 --> 01:21.457
Okay, let's go.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.928
Tector: Ah, you're wrong, Pope.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.891
The Volm are freedom fighters,
like the Contras.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.265
Tector, do you honestly think
when this is all finished,

01:38.349 --> 01:39.350
they're just going to what...?

01:39.391 --> 01:40.976
Ride off into the sunset?

01:41.060 --> 01:42.770
No, they got plans
for this place.

01:42.812 --> 01:44.855
Think about it.
You got your Volm family.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.260
They're cruising
across the cosmos

01:46.273 --> 01:48.526
in their interstellar S.U.V.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.904
They got to make a rest stop,
right? Some refreshments.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.322
No, no, I'm telling you,

01:53.364 --> 01:55.324
when this war is finished up,

01:55.366 --> 01:56.617
you, my friend,
are going to be standing behind

01:56.659 --> 01:58.661
a counter serving
hot dogs and super slurps

01:58.702 --> 02:00.538
to bubble heads
in Hawaiian shirts.

02:00.579 --> 02:03.749
Hey, Glamour Grunt,
is that a love bite?

02:03.833 --> 02:06.502
What, this?
It's a dueling scar.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.420
A little hand-to-claw action
with a Skitter.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.005
You fought
a cockroach barehanded?

02:10.089 --> 02:11.298
Oh, yeah.
Big fat one.

02:11.382 --> 02:12.716
Jumped out of a tree,
smack on my back.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.969
Holy crap.
How did you survive?

02:15.052 --> 02:17.888
Ah, I just flipped him over
my shoulder <i>Lucha Libre</i> style.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.306
That's when one of his buddies
charged me from behind.

02:19.390 --> 02:20.558
Maggie: He's lying.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.434
When he told me that story,

02:22.476 --> 02:25.521
he fought off three Skitters
and a Mech with a tire iron.

02:25.688 --> 02:27.231
(LAUGHS)

02:27.356 --> 02:28.941
If you expect a girl to hop
in the sack with you,

02:29.024 --> 02:30.109
you're going to have to do

02:30.192 --> 02:31.652
a whole lot better
than that, Lars.

02:31.694 --> 02:32.736
Well, if that girl
was you, Mags,

02:32.778 --> 02:34.113
I certainly would.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.322
(MAGGIE LAUGHS)

02:35.489 --> 02:38.409
I would start with a bouquet
of fresh-cut wildflowers,

02:38.450 --> 02:40.327
followed by dinner
at Pope's Bar,

02:40.411 --> 02:42.496
a bottle of his best champagne.

02:42.872 --> 02:44.123
And then...

02:46.292 --> 02:47.334
Hal,

02:47.376 --> 02:48.961
what are you doing here?

02:51.249 --> 02:52.649
I knew you were
coming off the line.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.592
I thought we could grab
some breakfast.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.343
Looks like you're busy.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.595
Hal.

02:57.928 --> 02:58.971
Hal!

03:01.098 --> 03:03.434
Lars and I are battle buddies.
You know what it's like.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.560
We're always busting each other.

03:04.643 --> 03:09.148
Yeah, hey, I know what it's like,
with us, and where that led.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.567
What, you seriously think
I'm sleeping with Lars?

03:14.153 --> 03:15.487
Are you?

03:15.905 --> 03:18.699
Can't even believe you
asked that

03:18.782 --> 03:21.118
after what we've been through
the past seven months.

03:25.039 --> 03:27.875
Maggie, I'm sorry.
You don't deserve that.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.044
Yeah, you're damn right,
I don't.

03:31.659 --> 03:32.939
You're not trapped
in that chair.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.590
You know you can get up
anytime you like.

03:34.673 --> 03:35.633
I don't want to hear
anything else

03:35.716 --> 03:36.926
about the mud on my boots,
all right?

03:36.967 --> 03:38.177
I'm not walking in my sleep.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.970
Then how did the mud
get there, Hal?

03:40.012 --> 03:41.680
You know damn well how.

03:41.764 --> 03:43.474
You think Dumbo's
magic-feather trick

03:43.515 --> 03:44.755
is going to make me walk again?

03:49.438 --> 03:51.857
Look, I know Karen
did something to you.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.779
I don't know how,
but she put you in that chair.

03:54.276 --> 03:57.655
And now, for some reason,
you don't want to get out of it.

04:00.658 --> 04:02.826
You're holding
something back, Hal.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.621
I can see it every time
I look in your eyes.

04:05.663 --> 04:07.623
I know you think
I'm lying to you,

04:07.665 --> 04:09.625
I'm playing games with you.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.794
You're the one
who's keeping a secret from me.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.965
I just wish the hell I knew why.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.141
Okay.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.021
We all know
it's a tough nut to crack.

04:31.105 --> 04:32.982
Dan's got the only plan
that might get us

04:33.065 --> 04:34.149
by those Mech emplacements.

04:34.233 --> 04:37.987
It's tactically unsound.
It's damn near insane.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.113
On the other hand,
it just might work.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.656
I like the sound of it already.

04:42.074 --> 04:44.618
Weaver: The main entrance is
heavily guarded by Mechs.

04:44.660 --> 04:45.869
We'll never get through it.

04:45.953 --> 04:49.790
Our only hope is to come through
these dense woods,

04:49.873 --> 04:52.459
down this cliff.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.420
Get them from behind.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.547
But no matter
how good the plan is,

04:56.588 --> 04:58.924
if our spy leaks it
to the enemy,

04:58.966 --> 05:00.592
we'll be walking into an ambush.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.802
But the Volm feel that

05:01.885 --> 05:03.304
this is an essential target
to hit,

05:03.345 --> 05:04.471
and I'm inclined to agree
with them.

05:04.555 --> 05:05.639
These Mega-Mechs,

05:05.723 --> 05:06.763
they're part of the forces

05:06.807 --> 05:08.487
the Espheni want to use
against Charleston.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.103
We deny them their fuel,

05:11.186 --> 05:12.271
we knock these
pieces off the board.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.606
Will the Volm be joining us
on this mission?

05:14.690 --> 05:15.691
No, they will not.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.609
We can't leave
the city unprotected.

05:17.693 --> 05:21.113
You will take a small unit
of our best fighters.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.614
General Bressler's troops
will stay on the perimeter,

05:22.698 --> 05:24.908
and the Volm will stay
in Charleston to assist them.

05:24.992 --> 05:25.992
Yes, sir.

05:26.035 --> 05:28.620
We still haven't talked about
the elephant in the room.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.123
I can get a team close enough

05:31.206 --> 05:34.626
to destroy the reactor
with one of Cochise's big guns.

05:34.710 --> 05:37.296
But if we blow it up,

05:37.338 --> 05:40.007
we're going to spew
radioactive fallout sky high.

05:40.049 --> 05:42.051
It'll be a homegrown Chernobyl.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.135
Marina: Depending on the winds,

05:43.218 --> 05:46.388
it could poison everything,
even as far away as here.

05:46.472 --> 05:48.807
Maybe these Volm have
some kind of high-tech gizmo

05:48.891 --> 05:50.017
which can prevent that
from happening.

05:50.059 --> 05:51.101
Nope.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.103
And they don't have anything
that can help us

05:53.187 --> 05:54.467
contain a massive
radiation leak.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.690
Is there anybody in Charleston

05:56.774 --> 05:59.151
that has any expertise
in nuclear reactors?

06:01.236 --> 06:02.654
Dr. Roger Kadar.

06:02.738 --> 06:03.989
He runs our power grid.

06:04.073 --> 06:05.616
Kadar taught nuclear engineering

06:05.657 --> 06:07.951
at the University of
South Carolina before the war.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.620
Have him meet me in my office.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.704
Not going to happen.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.623
Kadar is agoraphobic.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.666
He never leaves the power plant
beneath the city.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.002
If you want to talk to him,
we have to go to him.

06:19.588 --> 06:20.964
Dr. Kadar is among
the first people

06:21.048 --> 06:22.633
to arrive in Charleston.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.426
Arthur Manchester
struck a deal with him.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.637
If Kadar would help
provide power to the city,

06:26.720 --> 06:28.597
Manchester would make sure
he gets everything he needs,

06:28.639 --> 06:29.848
he wouldn't have to leave
his power plant.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.451
We've continued to honor
that agreement.

06:31.475 --> 06:32.601
We?

06:32.643 --> 06:34.019
You have enough
on your plate, Tom.

06:34.103 --> 06:35.771
No need to deal
with Kadar until now.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.233
Dr. Kadar?
It's Marina Peralta...

06:43.153 --> 06:44.738
No, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

06:44.780 --> 06:46.300
You'll contaminate
the reaction system.

06:46.365 --> 06:47.616
I've been trying to obtain
this combustion efficiency

06:47.699 --> 06:48.742
for over a month!

06:48.784 --> 06:51.120
What the hell kind of
contraption is that?

06:53.205 --> 06:55.624
This facility is off limits to
unauthorized personnel.

06:55.707 --> 06:56.667
What are they doing
down here, Marina?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.335
This is Tom Mason.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.758
The... The President.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.138
I didn't vote for you.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.722
I won't hold that against you.

07:11.765 --> 07:16.019
(CLEARS THROAT) Uh, this is,
one of my top military aides.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.438
This is Dan Weaver.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.232
Hi.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.734
Well, that's not
the right ratio at all.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.236
Mathematically, that's not...

07:24.319 --> 07:26.280
No, it's a chemical reaction.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.882
I mean, the numbers
shouldn't even be...

07:28.824 --> 07:32.202
Oh, come on.
This is a waste of time.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.620
Yes, it is.
I have work to do.

07:33.704 --> 07:34.704
Right.

07:34.705 --> 07:35.706
Dr. Kadar,

07:35.789 --> 07:37.291
we understand you're the person
we have to thank

07:37.374 --> 07:38.854
for all the electricity
in Charleston.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.335
Kadar: That's right,
and with this generator,

07:40.419 --> 07:43.755
I'll be able to produce
10.5 kilowatt hours per day.

07:43.839 --> 07:46.216
Tom: Your team has done
an amazing job down here.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.010
L... I don't...
I don't have a team.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.303
I've done this all myself.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.386
Tom: Oh, no team?

07:50.429 --> 07:53.640
Well, then you're probably
the only person who can help us.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.267
Kadar: Help you with what?

07:55.726 --> 07:58.687
We need to know
if there's a way to safely

07:58.770 --> 08:00.814
destroy the Wakonda reactor.

08:09.490 --> 08:10.616
By safely,

08:10.699 --> 08:13.410
I assume you mean
you do not want to rain

08:13.494 --> 08:15.204
radioactive waste
over the state,

08:15.287 --> 08:17.831
leaving it uninhabitable
for the next 24,100 years?

08:17.915 --> 08:18.915
That's right.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.357
We'd like to avoid
that if possible.

08:22.711 --> 08:26.924
Well, that's...
That's a bit of a poser.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.007
That's a fun one.

08:31.553 --> 08:32.993
I'll have something
for you tomorrow.

08:36.058 --> 08:38.185
Well, I guess
the interview's over.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.354
Anne: Yeah.

08:41.396 --> 08:45.901
There you go, little girl.
All clean and warm.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.904
I love you. I love you.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.490
You're so cute.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.707
What are you looking at?

09:04.086 --> 09:05.420
You're just a week old.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.589
You shouldn't be able
to track like that.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.885
(LAUGHS)

09:13.637 --> 09:14.680
Alexis: Mama.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.308
(BABY LAUGHS)

09:18.475 --> 09:19.476
Alexis?

09:19.726 --> 09:22.104
(BABY LAUGHING)

09:22.312 --> 09:23.480
Alexis?

09:25.857 --> 09:28.360
Oh, God. What...

09:28.402 --> 09:29.444
Alexis: Mama.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.907
- (BABY LAUGHING)
- (GASPING)

09:38.787 --> 09:40.122
Mommy.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.343
Sorry I'm late.
Is she still awake?

09:53.385 --> 09:54.386
Barely.

09:54.428 --> 09:58.056
She just ate,
so her eyes are getting heavy.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.270
Here. Oh, yeah.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.022
Oh, I have been dying to

10:05.105 --> 10:07.065
get back to you all day.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.735
She's a very different
little girl.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.486
- Different?
- Yeah.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.614
Different in what way?

10:13.655 --> 10:16.533
She's very advanced.

10:18.493 --> 10:19.620
I don't follow.

10:22.372 --> 10:25.042
(LAUGHS)
Maybe it's just my imagination.

10:26.627 --> 10:29.421
Anyways, I'm going to be late
for my shift.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.340
- Milk's in the fridge.
- All right.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.091
Okay.

10:35.344 --> 10:38.430
Oh, Lexie.
Oh, that's good.

10:38.472 --> 10:42.059
Hello, Lexie.
It's your daddy.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.023
I'll check in on you
a little later.

10:51.610 --> 10:54.154
Got to admit I'm envious.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.447
Of what?

10:55.530 --> 10:56.865
Alexis.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.326
Why is that?

10:59.910 --> 11:01.036
Because whenever new mothers

11:01.119 --> 11:02.663
bring their babies in
for check-ups,

11:02.746 --> 11:06.041
I look into the kid's eyes
and realize they don't know.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.835
A baby has no way of knowing

11:08.919 --> 11:10.170
there's been an apocalypse

11:10.253 --> 11:12.839
and that we're at war
and people are out there

11:12.923 --> 11:14.633
dying every day.

11:14.925 --> 11:19.221
To a baby,
everything's new and wondrous.

11:19.262 --> 11:20.702
And it thrills them
just to be alive.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.477
It must bring you so much joy

11:25.560 --> 11:27.479
having her.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.989
Are you all right?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.032
Yeah.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.534
I'm fine.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.119
You seem...

11:43.870 --> 11:46.039
Is everything okay with Alexis?

11:49.042 --> 11:51.586
She's really good.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.463
I'm going to go check on
Ms. McManus.

12:14.609 --> 12:15.609
Duct tape.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.738
Math class started
10 minutes ago.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.782
Oh, how I wish I could be there
with Mr. Hooper and the gang

12:20.866 --> 12:23.076
learning all about
trapezoids and parallelograms.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.119
Stop!

12:24.202 --> 12:26.621
My head is going to
explode from that.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.291
Yeah, it's so stupid
learning that crap.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.818
How's math going to help us kick
the aliens off this planet?

12:32.627 --> 12:33.670
Match.

12:37.382 --> 12:38.550
Hey.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.218
Do you think
it'll make too big a bang?

12:40.302 --> 12:41.636
I mean, we could
get in trouble, right?

12:41.720 --> 12:44.556
Relax. It's only a half stick.
It'll just blow out the window.

12:44.598 --> 12:45.557
Markley: Yeah, don't be such a wimp.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.101
This is going to be killer.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.499
(EXPLOSION)

13:18.173 --> 13:20.967
That was totally epic.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.135
Matt?

13:25.055 --> 13:26.890
- Awesome.
- (LAUGHING)

13:30.769 --> 13:31.769
Tick, tick...

13:31.812 --> 13:34.397
Boom! Yeah!

13:34.481 --> 13:36.650
<i>Man: Hold there!
Got movement!</i>

13:36.691 --> 13:37.943
Go, come on.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.820
Run! Go!

13:44.741 --> 13:46.159
Matt?

13:46.243 --> 13:48.620
What the hell
have you been up to?

13:51.122 --> 13:53.542
You're lucky you didn't blow
yourself to pieces.

13:53.625 --> 13:54.793
Do you know people
heard the explosion

13:54.876 --> 13:56.461
and thought
we were under attack?

13:57.003 --> 13:59.923
Did you stop to think about
how that would scare them?

14:00.006 --> 14:01.091
Not really.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.854
Why would you do
something like this, Matt?

14:04.427 --> 14:05.720
(SIGHS)

14:06.847 --> 14:09.558
I don't know.
Bored, I guess.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.518
(SCOFFS)

14:13.770 --> 14:15.605
Is that why you haven't been
going to school?

14:17.440 --> 14:18.525
Your teacher, Mr. Hooper,

14:18.608 --> 14:19.818
he stopped by
a little while ago to say

14:19.901 --> 14:22.153
you haven't been to class
in four days.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.572
And you haven't done
any of your homework

14:23.655 --> 14:24.655
for the past week.

14:24.656 --> 14:25.866
So what?

14:25.949 --> 14:27.389
School's useless.
I'm not going back.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.160
Yes, you are, Matt.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.202
You can't tell me what to do.
You're not my mother!

14:40.297 --> 14:42.591
You're right, Matt.
I'm not your mother.

14:44.342 --> 14:45.802
But as a concerned citizen,

14:45.886 --> 14:47.804
I'm going to ask Anthony to
escort you back to school.

14:47.846 --> 14:48.972
School ended half an hour ago.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.140
Not for you.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.017
You have an extra
two hours of detention

14:52.100 --> 14:53.184
for the next two weeks.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.646
Anthony.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.151
Anthony.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.659
(EXHALES)

15:11.453 --> 15:13.163
Kadar: I've thought about
your problem.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.624
(SIGHS) It's, uh...

15:15.665 --> 15:17.000
It's tricky.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.961
If you demolish
the reactor building,

15:20.003 --> 15:21.671
you destroy the cooling system,
as well.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.174
So the nuclear fuel overheats,
and the steam...

15:24.257 --> 15:27.552
Would blow up the reactor
and rain radioactive debris

15:27.636 --> 15:28.636
all over the countryside.

15:28.678 --> 15:29.679
Kadar: Right.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.890
So you have to turn
the reactor off

15:31.973 --> 15:33.141
before you blow it.

15:33.224 --> 15:36.102
That would mean sending
a team into the facility.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.186
Kadar: Yeah.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.940
And that's just the first part.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.775
Then you have to render
the system inoperable

15:41.816 --> 15:44.319
without compromising
the integrity

15:44.350 --> 15:45.671
of the reactor
containment vessel.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.322
That means destabilizing

15:47.364 --> 15:48.657
precise structural
tipping points

15:48.740 --> 15:51.451
so the building's collapse
will entomb the reactor

15:51.493 --> 15:52.661
without impairing its shielding.

15:52.702 --> 15:55.038
I didn't understand a damn word
of what you just said.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.706
Just give it to us
in laymen's terms.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.543
(STAMMERING)

16:00.710 --> 16:04.255
If you put your
detonation charges in

16:04.297 --> 16:05.590
exactly the right places,

16:05.674 --> 16:07.550
then, yes,
you can destroy the building,

16:07.592 --> 16:10.136
you can wreck the system
without leaking any radiation.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.222
Can you show us
where to put the charges?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.224
Sure, once I see
the facility's plans,

16:14.307 --> 16:16.142
and elementary physics.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.184
It'll be fun.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.229
Well, the fun has just begun.
We don't have any plans.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.231
You're going to have to come up
and show our demolition team

16:21.314 --> 16:22.399
where to set those charges.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.734
I never go topside.
And I can't. I'm sorry.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.736
Dr. Kadar,
you are the man for this job.

16:26.778 --> 16:27.778
Okay, goodbye.
Good bye.

16:27.821 --> 16:28.861
Dr. Kadar,
you can do this.

16:28.863 --> 16:29.948
- I can't.
- You can go.

16:30.031 --> 16:31.231
Nothing good happens up there.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.575
You can do this.
It's easy.

16:32.617 --> 16:33.660
- I can't.
- You can.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.704
I can't. I can't.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.206
I had a deal with Manchester.
I had a deal...

16:38.289 --> 16:39.289
I know.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.291
That I would never
have to go tops...

16:40.375 --> 16:42.210
I remember.
But things are different now.

16:42.919 --> 16:46.214
All of our lives depend
on this mission.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.465
You can do this.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.843
(PANTING)

16:52.721 --> 16:54.681
We don't want to lose
any more children.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.285
Proceed, General.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.368
Yes, sir.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.497
People, what we're about
to discuss in this room

17:19.539 --> 17:20.874
is highly classified.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.585
What that means is
whatever's said in this room

17:23.668 --> 17:25.837
may not be repeated
outside this room.

17:26.171 --> 17:28.298
This is a need-to-know
basis only.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.841
Anybody involved in the mission

17:29.924 --> 17:32.260
is being told only
what they need to know

17:32.302 --> 17:33.845
for their part of the operation.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.555
All right, Dan.

17:36.598 --> 17:37.766
Yes, sir.

17:38.475 --> 17:43.772
The success of this mission
rests upon surprise and speed.

17:43.855 --> 17:45.774
If the Espheni get wind of it,

17:45.857 --> 17:50.320
mission failure is probable,
death all but certain.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.406
We're taking the risk
because this operation

17:53.448 --> 17:56.076
can cripple
the enemy war machine.

17:56.117 --> 17:57.660
Understood?

17:59.287 --> 18:03.374
Anthony. Ben. Pope.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.837
I will lead my core group of
fighters north

18:07.879 --> 18:09.339
along Mill Highway.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.342
We will then head east on 1081,

18:13.093 --> 18:15.345
secure our vehicles,

18:15.386 --> 18:19.474
travel by foot to this bluff
overlooking the reactor.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.851
We will then descend
into this gorge

18:21.893 --> 18:24.896
and enter through
the back end of the facility.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.941
Pope: So you think we can
just sneak in from behind

18:28.024 --> 18:29.901
and take the Espheni
by surprise?

18:30.068 --> 18:32.403
(LAUGHS) Well, that's insane.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.364
Which is exactly
what the enemy thinks.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.366
Which is why they have left

18:36.449 --> 18:38.368
the back end
of the plant undefended.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.911
Any more questions?

18:52.162 --> 18:54.443
Crazy Lee: Wish the hell they'd
tell us where we're going.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.927
Lyle: Don't worry about it.

18:55.969 --> 18:59.180
Tom told Pope our real target,
and Pope told Tector.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.142
Spill it, big man.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.726
Fort Knox.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.437
Turns out the Espheni
came here for our gold.

19:06.521 --> 19:09.607
Tector told you that?
And you believe him?

19:11.401 --> 19:13.319
Okay, I'll prove it to you.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.905
Hey, Benji.
Where we headed?

19:15.989 --> 19:17.073
You'll find out
when we get there.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.199
See what you started?

19:18.270 --> 19:19.510
Now everyone's calling me that.

19:19.534 --> 19:20.702
Hey, Ben.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.956
You guys stay close
to each other.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.039
Be careful out there.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.001
Don't be a hero.
I know.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.173
See you in the morning.

19:34.841 --> 19:35.842
Don't worry, Mr. Mason.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.286
I won't let anything
happen to him.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.889
Weaver: A lot rides on this one, Tom.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.726
It's a solid plan.
It's going to work.

19:44.767 --> 19:47.353
They're all solid plans
till the first bullet flies,

19:47.437 --> 19:50.273
and then they're as relevant
as yesterday's racing forms.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.609
Oh, you'll pull through.
You always do.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.652
When I have you by my side.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.696
To ask the hard questions.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.156
Give you a swift kick
in the butt

19:58.239 --> 19:59.282
if you need it.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.412
Well.

20:04.495 --> 20:07.498
You have your job to do now.
I have mine.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.876
I guess that's the way
it's got to be.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.252
Hey, Dan.

20:11.336 --> 20:12.503
Weaver: Yeah?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.092
Stay frosty.

20:20.637 --> 20:22.889
Like a winter in Buffalo.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.350
People,

20:25.433 --> 20:27.977
stow the talk and your gear!

20:28.019 --> 20:29.604
We're moving out!

21:12.355 --> 21:14.774
(SQUEAKING)

21:27.704 --> 21:30.456
(GUNFIRE, EXPLOSIONS)

21:35.670 --> 21:36.713
They knew we were coming!

21:36.754 --> 21:38.423
We walked right into it!

21:38.506 --> 21:40.717
Shut up!
We need more firepower!

21:41.884 --> 21:43.636
(SCREAMING)

21:43.803 --> 21:46.014
I thought you said
this part of the reactor

21:46.097 --> 21:47.473
wasn't defended!

21:55.356 --> 21:56.566
It's working.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.027
The Mechs are leaving the gate
to attack Weaver's team.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.069
You were right.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.071
The mole leaked Colonel Weaver's
plans to the enemy.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.740
Tom: I'm using
my own people as bait,

22:03.823 --> 22:05.366
and they're paying in blood
for every second

22:05.408 --> 22:06.576
that we waste.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.376
(GUNFIRE, MEN SHOUTING)

22:17.170 --> 22:19.172
Refresh my memory, Cap!

22:19.213 --> 22:21.507
Was being massacred
part of the plan?

22:31.980 --> 22:33.620
Tom: Weaver's team
has bought us a window.

22:33.644 --> 22:35.229
The road to the power
plant's wide open.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.272
We're going in.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.316
Don't sweat it, Doc.
You can only die once.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.399
Thanks, that thought will be
a great comfort to me.

22:40.401 --> 22:41.986
No matter what happens,
you stay close to me, okay?

22:42.070 --> 22:43.154
I got your back.

22:43.237 --> 22:44.558
- How do you do it?
- What's that?

22:44.572 --> 22:46.157
All these people
depending on you?

22:46.199 --> 22:47.492
How do you carry that load?

22:47.533 --> 22:49.285
I don't have much of a choice.
Let's go.

It hurts.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.221
It's a child.

It's a harnessed soldier

into his system.

that are destroying

31:26.635 --> 31:27.803

I tried the most powerful
antibiotic we've got.

we did with Colonel Weaver

31:31.974 --> 31:33.183
where we take the blood out
and heat it up?

31:33.267 --> 31:34.310
It's too late for that.

31:34.351 --> 31:35.686
It's already in his liver
and his lungs.

He's got a couple hours at most.

The Espheni only knew
about my team, not yours.

33:39.226 --> 33:40.811
It had an element of surprise.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.134
I hope I never have to send you

33:42.146 --> 33:43.897
out on anything
like that ever again.

33:43.939 --> 33:45.274
That wasn't easy.

33:45.315 --> 33:46.567
Yeah.

33:46.942 --> 33:48.485
I never had any doubts.

33:48.527 --> 33:49.653
No?

33:50.154 --> 33:51.739
Not even a little bit?

33:55.659 --> 33:56.939
I never had
any doubts about you.

34:05.044 --> 34:07.463
But the Volm, you still have
your doubts about them, huh?

34:11.383 --> 34:13.802
What are we doing with these
new allies of ours, Tom?

34:13.844 --> 34:15.724
I mean, we don't even know
where they came from.

34:15.763 --> 34:17.723
They pointed to a star.
They said, "That's our home."

34:17.806 --> 34:18.891
Why should we believe that?

34:19.391 --> 34:20.809
I don't know.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.686
But everything
that they have told us

34:22.728 --> 34:24.605
is consistent with everything
that we do know.

34:25.564 --> 34:28.108
I do not believe
that they are these crusaders

34:28.192 --> 34:30.444
that are going
around saving all the planets

34:30.527 --> 34:32.029
that the Espheni have conquered.

34:32.071 --> 34:34.031
I don't believe that.
That's too good to be true.

34:34.073 --> 34:35.199
And even if
it's only partly true,

34:35.240 --> 34:36.366
there's no
getting around the fact

34:36.408 --> 34:38.249
that since they showed up,
the tide has turned.

34:38.285 --> 34:41.205
If they ever finish
that big weapon of theirs,

34:41.288 --> 34:43.248
we might win this war.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.330
How do we know that's a big
weapon they're building?

34:46.001 --> 34:48.504
They could be creating
something entirely different.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.089
We don't even
have the slightest idea

34:50.172 --> 34:51.340
how that thing works.

34:52.132 --> 34:54.676
That's a good point.

34:57.054 --> 34:58.263
It's a good point.

34:58.347 --> 35:00.307
Maybe Dr. Kadar
can help us with that.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.851
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Come in.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.858
Gentlemen, congratulations.

35:09.942 --> 35:14.071
When my team
first arrived on this planet,

35:14.154 --> 35:18.033
I had doubts about
our mission's chance of success,

35:18.117 --> 35:21.912
but, over the past seven months,

35:21.995 --> 35:23.705
I have watched
you hone your soldiers

35:23.747 --> 35:26.041
into a highly skilled force.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.377
And after the way
they acquitted themselves

35:28.460 --> 35:30.420
on this latest engagement,

35:30.504 --> 35:33.298
I am certain you will
prevail over the Espheni.

35:33.382 --> 35:35.342
Don't need you to tell me that.

35:35.425 --> 35:37.177
But thank you, Cochise.

35:37.261 --> 35:40.055
We are very proud of the way
our people conducted themselves.

35:40.139 --> 35:42.933
And I guess we won't be hearing
from the Espheni anytime soon.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.059
Cochise: On the contrary.

35:44.143 --> 35:46.770
You can expect them
to attack Charleston in force.

35:46.854 --> 35:48.480
Really?

35:48.522 --> 35:50.357
It seems we knocked
a lot of their assets out today,

35:50.440 --> 35:51.900
destroyed most of their
fuel supply.

35:51.984 --> 35:54.278
Cochise: Most, but not all.

35:54.361 --> 35:56.071
We have learned
that they are bringing in

35:56.113 --> 35:58.907
every surviving Mech
and Beamer in this region,

35:58.949 --> 36:01.618
consolidating
whatever supplies they have left

36:01.702 --> 36:06.123
and will hit you hard to prove
you have not weakened them.

36:06.206 --> 36:08.417
So I advise
you to keep your soldiers

36:08.458 --> 36:10.502
on the perimeter at high alert.

36:35.235 --> 36:36.570
(DOOR CREAKING)

36:37.529 --> 36:41.325
Dad, I guess you heard

36:41.366 --> 36:42.993
about me blowing a hole
in that building.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.870
Uh, yeah, I did.

36:46.705 --> 36:49.416
I realize it was
a stupid thing to do.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.001
It scared a lot of people.

36:51.043 --> 36:52.169
That's an understatement.

36:53.665 --> 36:56.065
Did you know that that building
was one that we were planning

36:56.089 --> 36:58.425
on refurbishing so families
could move back into it?

36:58.508 --> 36:59.927
No.

37:01.241 --> 37:02.322
I thought it was abandoned.

37:02.346 --> 37:03.347
I figured as much.

37:03.430 --> 37:04.640
Anyway, I signed you up
for a work crew

37:04.681 --> 37:06.350
after school so you could
help repair the damage.

37:06.433 --> 37:07.476
That's okay.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.478
I don't mind
fixing what I blew up.

37:10.771 --> 37:13.607
But I don't see
the point of school.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.484
You know, memorizing
the names of dead people

37:15.525 --> 37:17.277
won't help us win this war.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.741
Matt, one day,
this war's going to be over.

37:25.047 --> 37:26.888
And when it is,
we're going to need some people

37:26.912 --> 37:28.872
with a lot of skill
to rebuild this country.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.086
I may not live to see
that day, but you will.

37:35.504 --> 37:36.922
That's why
you're staying in school.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.215
Even math class?

37:38.298 --> 37:40.008
Especially math class.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.178
How come you're being so nice?

37:43.220 --> 37:45.055
I thought you'd be doing
a lot more yelling.

37:45.097 --> 37:47.099
Because this isn't
entirely your fault.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.725
I've been so busy with this job

37:48.767 --> 37:50.328
I haven't really
paid you any attention.

37:50.978 --> 37:52.813
That's going to change
starting tomorrow.

37:52.896 --> 37:55.482
I'm going to come home
and help you with your homework.

37:56.775 --> 37:57.943
Uh...

37:58.819 --> 38:00.570
I guess I like
the sound of that.

38:01.697 --> 38:03.365
(LAUGHS)

38:07.327 --> 38:08.412
Dad.

38:08.495 --> 38:10.998
Can I talk to you
about something else?

38:11.039 --> 38:12.249
Sure.

38:12.332 --> 38:14.835
I... I did something really bad.

38:14.876 --> 38:16.253
You mean worse than
blowing a hole

38:16.336 --> 38:17.754
in the side of a building?

38:17.796 --> 38:19.172
Yeah.

38:20.007 --> 38:22.259
I said something mean to Anne.

38:22.342 --> 38:23.927
Really mean.

38:25.304 --> 38:26.824
I'm not sure
if she'll ever forgive me.

38:29.516 --> 38:30.559
I don't know.

38:30.642 --> 38:31.893
She's a pretty
understanding person.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.854
What should I do?

38:34.604 --> 38:36.398
You should talk to her.

39:04.301 --> 39:07.137
I'm, uh, sorry about what I said.

39:08.555 --> 39:10.724
I was mad, and I didn't mean it.

39:12.351 --> 39:13.518
I know.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.146
Thank you for saying so.

39:20.484 --> 39:21.735
Would you mind...

39:23.445 --> 39:24.738
Mind what?

39:27.741 --> 39:29.076
If I, like...

39:31.411 --> 39:33.038
called you mom?

39:37.459 --> 39:39.086
I wouldn't mind at all.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.641
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

40:00.899 --> 40:02.651
She's such a happy baby.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.570
Have you noticed
she never cries?

40:05.862 --> 40:07.447
It's true.

40:07.531 --> 40:10.450
You and your brothers used
to scream your heads off.

40:12.285 --> 40:15.288
But she does,
she seems quite content.

40:17.165 --> 40:20.961
She's a very unique little girl.

40:40.313 --> 40:41.440
Hal!

40:44.943 --> 40:46.153
Hal!

40:47.821 --> 40:50.323
(FROGS CROAKING)

40:53.785 --> 40:54.828
Hal!

40:54.870 --> 40:56.538
Hal.

40:56.621 --> 40:57.706
Hal.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.710
Hal.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.086
Hal.

41:03.128 --> 41:04.713
Wake up.
Wake up.

41:04.754 --> 41:05.755
What? What?
What's going on?

41:05.797 --> 41:06.997
You're walking.
You're walking.

41:10.594 --> 41:13.597
(GRUNTS) See?
You're not paralyzed.

41:13.680 --> 41:14.806
Okay?

41:15.182 --> 41:17.058
I'm walking.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.102
I'm walking.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.353
Come on.

41:22.022 --> 41:23.190
Let's get you home.
