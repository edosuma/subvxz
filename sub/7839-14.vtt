00:29.054 --> 00:30.895
Why does god always need money?

00:31.112 --> 00:32.698
It's a lot of little stuff.

00:32.764 --> 00:35.213
God has to pay all the elves in his workshop.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.426
Plus he's got all those planets to support.

00:37.463 --> 00:39.548
Did you see that ring he gave saturn?

00:45.219 --> 00:47.273
Who knew saints had such fat heads?

00:47.385 --> 00:48.641
It's all a big scam.

00:48.762 --> 00:49.464
This booth?

00:49.674 --> 00:50.748
No, religion in general.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.575
Not bad.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.152
Here's your candy apple, sir.

01:08.660 --> 01:09.593
Excellent.

01:09.703 --> 01:13.797
This fundraiser is close to 
achieving the lord's goal:

01:13.959 --> 01:15.988
Building a taller steeple than the one

01:16.025 --> 01:19.482
on that snooty episcopal 
church across the street.

01:19.532 --> 01:22.433
Reverend, why do we really need this?

01:22.827 --> 01:25.028
To compensate for my own sense of smallness.

01:25.064 --> 01:26.306
And now for our main event:

01:26.368 --> 01:28.298
The rubber duck race.

01:28.433 --> 01:32.958
The first duck to cross the finish 
line wins this home computer.

01:34.730 --> 01:38.797
That's the new femac, the computer 
designed just for women.

01:39.072 --> 01:42.220
The "you've got mail" voice is Susan Sarandon.

01:42.504 --> 01:46.242
You've got mail, unlike the prisoners 
at Guantanamo Bay.

01:46.459 --> 01:47.516
Get informed.

01:49.579 --> 01:50.542
Don't worry, Marge.

01:50.575 --> 01:54.030
Me and terrible two here are going 
to win that computer for you.

01:54.153 --> 01:55.542
How can you be sure?

01:55.739 --> 01:57.362
'Cause he wants it.

01:58.672 --> 02:01.241
On your marks, get set...

02:01.414 --> 02:01.869
wait.

02:02.220 --> 02:04.495
Someone's not on their mark.

02:05.304 --> 02:06.702
That's better. Go!

02:17.657 --> 02:21.675
Now to begin operation slight edge.

02:25.488 --> 02:26.782
I'm winning!

02:30.975 --> 02:32.586
He's headed for the old mill!

02:32.705 --> 02:34.816
No, cheatie, no!

02:42.216 --> 02:43.458
Too many paddles!

02:58.588 --> 03:00.186
Protect the duck. D'oh!

03:00.393 --> 03:01.696
Protect the duck. Uh!

03:02.168 --> 03:03.783
PRoduck the tect.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.322
Hey! This race is for rubber 
ducks, not meat ducks.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.428
whoo-hoo! I won.

03:40.616 --> 03:43.152
And the winner is... duh!

03:44.160 --> 03:45.779
A living duck?

03:45.911 --> 03:48.337
I wished too hard and he became real.

03:50.182 --> 03:53.615
And the winner is Ned Flanders.

03:53.682 --> 03:56.855
This is my favorite kind of surprise: Mild.

03:58.288 --> 03:59.492
There, there.

03:59.506 --> 04:02.199
The fact that you tried means everything.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.907
Hey, that's the same thing you said to Bart

04:05.005 --> 04:07.117
after he choked in that soccer game.

04:07.341 --> 04:09.412
And we both know he sucked.

04:09.461 --> 04:12.075
And how. But this is different.

04:17.276 --> 04:19.841
Hey, Marge, I don't, I don't really want a computer.

04:19.870 --> 04:23.596
You know, all those complete strangers 
googling each other makes my flesh

04:23.620 --> 04:24.237
crawl.

04:24.503 --> 04:26.740
Just put it in the trunk and leave.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.711
Ned, that's so generous.

04:32.833 --> 04:35.059
But there must be something I could do in return.

04:35.145 --> 04:38.034
Well, sir, we could do a little 
quid pro for the kaypro.

04:38.126 --> 04:41.926
That left-handed convention is in 
town and as the owner of Springfield's

04:41.981 --> 04:42.509
largest

04:42.546 --> 04:46.087
southpaw shop, I just got to be there. 
Could you nanny-goat my

04:46.148 --> 04:47.381
kid-diddly-ids?

04:49.538 --> 04:50.989
Let me see.

04:51.013 --> 04:51.799
Just a sec.

04:52.797 --> 04:53.468
Yeah, sure.

04:53.505 --> 04:55.896
I'd be happy to baby-sit for Rod and Todd.

05:00.259 --> 05:01.059
I'm so glad you're

05:01.108 --> 05:02.474
watching the boys, Marge.

05:02.527 --> 05:05.746
Our last baby-sitter let them 
watch comedy central.

05:05.831 --> 05:08.688
Now Rod makes me check the closet 
every night for Rita Rudner.

05:09.822 --> 05:11.806
No Rudner.

05:11.833 --> 05:15.115
Here's the numbers for the police, 
fire, ambulance, poison control, burn

05:15.165 --> 05:15.509
clinic

05:15.609 --> 05:17.502
and people nearby with Rod and Todd's blood type.

05:17.613 --> 05:19.287
Carl.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.234
So you're going to be chilling with me tonight.

05:23.433 --> 05:24.682
You want to play a game?

05:24.773 --> 05:26.671
How about a sitting-still contest?

05:26.728 --> 05:27.793
Hands folded.

05:35.537 --> 05:36.939
Okay, game over.

05:37.132 --> 05:38.103
It's a tie.

05:38.162 --> 05:39.908
That means we both come in second.

05:40.129 --> 05:41.593
We're number two!

05:41.727 --> 05:43.092
We're number two!

05:43.518 --> 05:44.709
What do you think, Maggie?

05:53.285 --> 05:56.197
Wow, it's the big unit himself, Randy Johnson.

05:56.362 --> 05:59.641
You fanned more men than Salome.

05:59.733 --> 06:01.126
Yeah, I get that a lot.

06:01.238 --> 06:02.837
I'm here promoting my new line

06:02.861 --> 06:05.139
of left-hand teddy bears, Randy Johnson southpawz.

06:05.269 --> 06:06.563
This one's a doctor.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.933
You can give it to your doctor.

06:08.621 --> 06:10.837
You have one for a mailman?

06:11.316 --> 06:12.770
A bear can't be a mailman.

06:12.938 --> 06:14.672
Now how many Dr. Bears do you want?

06:14.770 --> 06:16.344
They come in boxes of a thousand.

06:19.332 --> 06:20.051
One box.

06:20.439 --> 06:21.915
You and me got a problem.

06:25.506 --> 06:26.736
Here's my mask.

06:27.031 --> 06:29.195
I'm a Star Wars.

06:30.769 --> 06:32.436
Now let's see who you've drawn.

06:32.669 --> 06:34.512
I'm my brother Todd.

06:34.576 --> 06:36.353
I'm my brother Rod.

06:36.966 --> 06:38.496
Ah! This is too scary!

06:38.545 --> 06:39.250
Change back!

06:41.592 --> 06:43.190
I'll help you.

06:45.433 --> 06:46.601
I'm a chimpmunk.

06:46.650 --> 06:48.864
I eat nuts without saying grace.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.858
I'm a permission slip.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.687
And thank you god for 
letting Mrs. Simpson come over.

06:55.797 --> 06:59.000
It was the most fun we've 
had since mommy was here.

07:00.521 --> 07:03.878
And could you ask mommy to come to daddy in a dream

07:03.952 --> 07:06.300
and tell him how to cut our sandwiches?

07:07.351 --> 07:09.196
And please tell Mrs. Simpson

07:09.196 --> 07:11.665
it's rude to eavesdrop on our prayers.

07:12.507 --> 07:13.972
But we forgive her.

07:16.304 --> 07:17.183
Hiya, Marge.

07:17.184 --> 07:18.511
Are Rod and Todd in the land of nod?

07:19.641 --> 07:21.185
We had a lot of fun.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.115
They're terrific kids.

07:23.342 --> 07:26.096
Hey, you're welcome to 
see the dynamic duo any time.

07:27.099 --> 07:29.374
Well, then maybe I will come by more often.

07:29.433 --> 07:31.520
And Homer can spend more time with our kids.

07:31.557 --> 07:32.705
He's watching them now.

07:36.162 --> 07:36.496
Ready?

07:36.663 --> 07:37.081
Ready.

07:37.294 --> 07:39.193
And joust!

07:50.442 --> 07:51.796
That was awesome!

07:51.879 --> 07:53.059
Let's do it again.

07:53.767 --> 07:55.719
A canoe made of country ham?

07:55.774 --> 07:56.943
You know I'll eat it.

08:02.021 --> 08:02.939
What's wrong

08:02.970 --> 08:04.253
with your teeter-totter?

08:04.311 --> 08:07.431
Daddy says up and down see-saws are dangerous.

08:07.972 --> 08:08.995
Chocks?!

08:09.154 --> 08:10.062
Why don't we try it...

08:10.630 --> 08:12.070
freestyle.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.726
El mundo es loco!

08:56.156 --> 08:59.276
I heard in study hall you 
were baby-sitting tonight.

08:59.674 --> 09:00.827
Homer!

09:00.925 --> 09:02.537
We're not in high school.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.482
So, Marge, in tomorrow's game,

09:05.530 --> 09:08.543
I'm gonna recover a fumble just for you.

09:09.203 --> 09:12.757
Maybe you'll run it in for a touchdown.

09:12.832 --> 09:14.231
Don't pressure me.

09:14.277 --> 09:16.323
I get enough of that from my dad.

09:16.367 --> 09:21.522
Well, maybe we can take your mind 
off things by studying for the sat:

09:21.667 --> 09:23.357
"Snuggles and tickles."

09:33.589 --> 09:34.602
Old man Flanders!

09:37.149 --> 09:37.744
Hey, Homer.

09:37.864 --> 09:39.492
Sneaking kisses from the missus?

09:39.609 --> 09:41.237
Springfield high football rules!

09:43.565 --> 09:46.257
No one turn on the sprinklers, okay?

09:47.224 --> 09:48.779
Dad, mom's over at the Flanders',

09:48.807 --> 09:50.268
baby-sitting nimRod and nimTodd.

09:50.308 --> 09:51.832
We want to do something.

09:51.910 --> 09:54.670
Fine. As soon as I finish watching my show.

09:58.601 --> 10:01.106
I want to go to the showbiz 
animal retirement home.

10:01.212 --> 10:04.728
They take in animals from the movies 
and tv that aren't cute anymore.

10:14.060 --> 10:15.688
Old showbiz animals?

10:16.456 --> 10:17.656
Do you think any of the gremlins

10:17.709 --> 10:19.201
from the gremlins movie are there?

10:20.698 --> 10:21.272
Sure.

10:22.601 --> 10:24.333
I am gonna get them so wet.

10:31.372 --> 10:33.887
This is much sadder than I expected.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.238
Sad? You're crazy.

10:36.400 --> 10:40.188
I feel like I'm at the oscars for 
the animals I forgot existed.

10:43.670 --> 10:44.452
Aflac!

10:49.313 --> 10:50.909
I'm not a real bear!

10:51.098 --> 10:52.997
That was just the name of my character.

10:53.071 --> 10:53.927
Now let me out!

10:54.162 --> 10:55.607
Hey, you know where the bathroom is?

10:55.817 --> 10:58.676
Maybe I do and maybe I don't.

11:01.295 --> 11:04.722
You didn't hear it from me, 
but it's next to the rhino cage.

11:05.062 --> 11:08.474
Word on the street is: Cover 
the toilet seat with tissue.

11:08.714 --> 11:10.968
Sweet... sweet tissue.

11:13.843 --> 11:14.919
This is toot-toot.

11:15.107 --> 11:18.800
She played tum tum in teen 
tarzan's eco-adventures.

11:18.977 --> 11:20.741
She looks like she's crying.

11:23.648 --> 11:25.495
She probably misses her children.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.035
They're all in show business.

11:27.131 --> 11:29.645
One of them played the out-of-control judiciary

11:29.687 --> 11:31.576
in a republican party commercial.

11:32.260 --> 11:33.355
Cheer up, toot-toot.

11:33.452 --> 11:34.742
Have some of my ice cream.

11:48.934 --> 11:50.531
My son's been ape-napped!

11:50.663 --> 11:52.207
No, no, it's still "kid-napped."

11:52.332 --> 11:53.876
The prefix applies to the victim.

11:53.913 --> 11:55.697
Help! She's grooming me.

11:56.152 --> 11:57.217
She's grooming me!

11:58.055 --> 11:59.464
Aren't you gonna do something?

11:59.563 --> 12:01.525
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do now.

12:01.574 --> 12:04.621
A chimp that size could tear 
your son's head right off.

12:04.689 --> 12:06.223
But she'll leave the rest of him alone?

12:07.860 --> 12:09.060
Would you like to meet flipper?

12:10.650 --> 12:13.269
May I remind you they're old when they come here.

12:13.874 --> 12:14.839
Well, well.

12:14.909 --> 12:16.516
Look at my dull-eyed angels.

12:17.212 --> 12:17.791
What's this?

12:21.816 --> 12:23.924
It's the ripcord from a band-aid wrapper!

12:24.764 --> 12:28.604
Call me ned zeppelin, but is one 
of my boys abrased and contused?

12:29.619 --> 12:33.021
I cut myself on the knife, 
playing christian clue.

12:33.296 --> 12:35.227
The secular humanist did it in the schoolhouse

12:35.283 --> 12:36.524
with misinformation!

12:36.722 --> 12:40.092
Well, I think it's about 
time you boys get to bed.

12:40.254 --> 12:41.955
Yes, daddy.

12:42.039 --> 12:43.628
An so we don't have another disaster.

12:43.681 --> 12:45.256
You crawl up these steps!

12:50.961 --> 12:54.071
Ned, I know you like to worry, 
but these boys are never going

12:54.102 --> 12:57.806
to get self-confidence unless you 
let them try things for themselves.

12:57.908 --> 12:58.743
I just can't.

12:58.939 --> 13:02.831
They're all I've got since that sad 
day when maude found eternal happiness.

13:02.994 --> 13:04.674
I though they might enjoy it

13:04.732 --> 13:05.838
if I took them here.

13:06.296 --> 13:10.825
Everything's covered in foam, and it's 
owned by a corporation, so you know

13:10.870 --> 13:11.622
it's safe.

13:11.864 --> 13:14.752
Well, their mascot is a kneepad wearing a helmet.

13:15.009 --> 13:15.562
Why not?

13:16.264 --> 13:16.828
Where's Bart?

13:16.895 --> 13:18.466
I haven't seen him since you came home.

13:18.858 --> 13:21.415
You haven't seen Bart for a few hours,

13:21.520 --> 13:25.533
so you automatically assume I 
let something terrible happen.

13:25.823 --> 13:27.054
I didn't say that.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.484
I know what you think:

13:28.664 --> 13:31.044
When stupid Homer wasn't looking,

13:31.241 --> 13:33.985
Bart got kidnapped by a monkey.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.428
I could never think something that horrible.

13:36.470 --> 13:40.200
And now I'm using sarcasm 
to confess the whole thing,

13:40.330 --> 13:43.220
so later I could say that I already told you.

13:43.310 --> 13:44.600
Sorry I asked.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.060
Dad, you can't keep this up for long.

13:48.140 --> 13:49.650
You're so right.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.560
I guess I should be more concerned with Bart's safety

13:52.560 --> 13:54.300
than covering my own butt.

13:54.490 --> 13:58.530
And maybe I'm talking like this because I can't stop.

13:58.920 --> 14:04.530
Help me, Lisa! I have serious mental problems!

14:05.910 --> 14:07.270
Look, it's been fun and all,

14:07.270 --> 14:08.820
but I miss indoor plumbing.

14:14.100 --> 14:14.960
Sorry, lady.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.860
I've never eaten fresh fruit 
and I reckon I never will.

14:24.980 --> 14:26.930
This oreo is rank.

14:28.430 --> 14:28.860
Bart !

14:30.180 --> 14:30.840
Bart !

14:31.310 --> 14:36.250
When the monkey falls asleep, 
I'll sneak you out in this trash bag.

14:36.500 --> 14:41.360
Then i'll come back and feed the 
monkey a peach full of antifreeze.

15:06.260 --> 15:08.680
I fell asleep before the monkey.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.460
Lookin' good, Rod!

15:30.530 --> 15:32.980
Ned, are you checking up on me?

15:33.100 --> 15:34.230
I'm not Ned.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.020
I'm a... friendly dog.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.240
I'm not a good liar.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.260
I did come here to check on the....

15:41.650 --> 15:42.260
where's Rod?

15:42.440 --> 15:43.950
He's up there, daddy.

15:44.770 --> 15:46.380
Daddy! Look how high I am!

15:46.620 --> 15:48.020
What are you doing?!

15:48.230 --> 15:49.130
You're gonna get hurt!

15:49.410 --> 15:50.110
I am?

16:00.650 --> 16:01.890
He chipped a tooth!

16:02.050 --> 16:03.750
How will he bite wheat thins? How?!

16:03.920 --> 16:04.530
Comment ?

16:04.620 --> 16:06.480
I'm sorry, Ned.

16:06.690 --> 16:08.430
I never thought this would happen.

16:08.570 --> 16:11.130
I don't want you watching my boys ever again!

16:13.500 --> 16:14.810
She must be an unfit mother.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.010
I am not an unfit mother!

16:17.090 --> 16:19.110
We interrupt this skateboarding footage

16:19.110 --> 16:20.500
for a breaking news story.

16:20.590 --> 16:24.780
Local boy Bart simpson is being 
held hostage by an angry chimpanzee

16:24.950 --> 16:28.130
who has improved both 
his hygiene and posture.

16:28.210 --> 16:30.980
His so-called real mother could 
not be found for comment.

16:33.140 --> 16:35.620
Hey, monkey! Eat tranquilizer dart!

16:41.940 --> 16:45.020
Mr. Simpson was later revived 
by a police stun gun.

17:08.130 --> 17:10.020
Daddy, what are we gonna do today?

17:10.089 --> 17:13.170
Well, we're gonna do what every kid 
your age likes to do: Look at bread.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.599
No!

17:16.170 --> 17:17.290
The "n" word!

17:17.420 --> 17:19.099
We want Mrs. Simpson back.

17:19.180 --> 17:22.280
She let us run barefoot in 
the grass and play uno.

17:22.339 --> 17:24.720
Uno?! That's a gateway game to pinochle.

17:24.970 --> 17:28.040
All diddily aside, boys, what is 
it about her you miss so much?

17:28.230 --> 17:29.810
She made us feel happy.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.400
And not church-happy.

17:31.690 --> 17:33.070
For real happy.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.350
maybe there's another way to solve this.

17:37.450 --> 17:40.770
Bart is clearly fulfilling 
an emotional need for toot-toot.

17:40.870 --> 17:43.070
Lisa, monkeys don't have feelings.

17:43.140 --> 17:46.530
If they did, then my experiments 
could be called cruel.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.500
Toot-toot, look!

17:47.630 --> 17:49.390
I'm using this rock as a tool.

17:55.630 --> 17:57.300
She's kissing his boo-boo!

17:57.500 --> 17:59.110
That's it, I'm going in.

18:05.190 --> 18:09.750
Excuse me, Mrs. Toot, I need to 
talk to you mother to mother.

18:10.710 --> 18:15.690
While you were living the glamorous 
life of a tv chimp, I was raising my son.

18:15.850 --> 18:18.560
You have no right to take him away from me now.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.340
Please, please, give me back my boy.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.990
Marge, Toot-toot and her son escaped!

18:36.260 --> 18:39.320
The hamburglar was survived 
by his long-time companion,

18:39.580 --> 18:40.550
mayor Mccheese.

18:40.670 --> 18:43.170
Now, our latest update on 
monkey boy Bart Simpson.

18:43.210 --> 18:45.970
Toot-toot has taken Bart 
to the highest spot in town,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.710
the new steeple atop the first 
church of Springfield.

18:51.810 --> 18:55.100
Now, Marge, I know things look bleak,

18:55.370 --> 19:00.490
but it should comfort you to know 
we have this plaque ready to go.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.810
Hey, I know how we can save Bart.

19:10.660 --> 19:11.660
M. Teeny?

19:11.960 --> 19:14.580
He also happens to be toot-toot's son.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.640
But Krusty said mr. 
Teeny was born in funny town.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.200
Nelson, funny town doesn't exist.

19:20.500 --> 19:24.660
No! I was gonna live at cuckoo corners!

19:26.380 --> 19:28.950
Listen, we can trade Mr. Teeny for Bart.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.570
We just have to find a way to get him up there.

19:31.820 --> 19:33.650
I'm already doing it!

19:35.010 --> 19:36.030
Roddy, get down!

19:36.090 --> 19:37.280
You're gonna fall!

19:41.710 --> 19:46.530
Ned, Rod needs to know you believe 
he can be okay on his own.

19:49.030 --> 19:52.860
You'd be surprised what he could 
do if you just gave him a chance.

19:56.710 --> 19:57.140
Rod!

19:57.800 --> 19:58.770
You can do it, boy!

19:59.160 --> 20:02.370
With god on your side, you can't fail!

20:05.810 --> 20:08.530
Toot-toot, I have something for you.

20:11.080 --> 20:15.900
Reunited and it feel so good reunited

20:17.530 --> 20:22.020
'cause we understood.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.220
Yeah, great.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.890
Now I need a new sidekick.

20:28.260 --> 20:29.760
Get me a lemur, or a marmot.

20:29.930 --> 20:32.710
Or Tom Greene, he's not doing anything these days.

20:32.890 --> 20:34.720
And really stick it to him on the money.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.230
Hurry, let's climb down.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.730
Okay, but don't let our hands touch. It's gay.

20:38.880 --> 20:39.980
What's "gay" mean?

20:41.360 --> 20:46.080
It means you used to be afraid, 
but now you're not.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.610
I'm gay, daddy!

20:47.610 --> 20:48.630
I'm gay!

20:48.710 --> 20:51.080
Mrs. Simpson made me gay!

20:52.550 --> 20:55.770
I believe he's saying he's okay.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
My little boy's growing up.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Hey, I'll say!

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I haven't seen climbing like that

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
since Dudley Moore married Susan Anton!

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Bob, why did I wait a hundred years

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
to get you up here?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
You're tellin' me.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Now I can look down Dolly Parton's 
dress whenever I want.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
de Dolly Parton quand je le veux.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Guys, I'm trying to watch this.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Hey, I'm sorry.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
What got into her?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Her kid's fruitier than 
Carmen Miranda's hat rack.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Remember her?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Mr. Simpson was later revived 
by a police stun gun.
