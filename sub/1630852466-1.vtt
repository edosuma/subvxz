WEBVTT

00:33.650 --> 00:34.817
Thanks.

00:37.028 --> 00:39.155
Yeah, so I'll be
watching the game...

01:38.756 --> 01:39.966
What?

01:44.762 --> 01:46.347
Hi!

04:16.289 --> 04:19.375
<i>He couldn't know
that, at this very moment,</i>

04:19.458 --> 04:22.545
<i>people meeting in secret
all over the country</i>

04:22.628 --> 04:27.091
<i>were holding up their glasses
and saying in hushed voices,</i>

04:27.175 --> 04:31.846
<i>"To Harry Potter,
the boy who lived."</i>

04:38.895 --> 04:40.229
- Dan.
- Hey, man.

04:40.313 --> 04:41.647
It's great to see you.

04:41.731 --> 04:43.149
- How you doing, dude?
- How are you, mate?

04:43.232 --> 04:46.277
It's so nice to see you.
This is awesome.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.112
- This is incredible.
- Yeah, it is.

04:48.196 --> 04:50.156
Last time we were here,
you were shorter.

04:50.239 --> 04:52.200
I'm just...
just very, very slightly.

04:52.283 --> 04:54.577
That's kind of you to say.

04:54.660 --> 04:56.412
- Here we are.
- 20 years down the road.

04:56.495 --> 04:58.206
- Yeah.
- It's kind of odd.

04:58.289 --> 04:59.624
How did it come to you?
Like, I never...

04:59.707 --> 05:01.125
I would never
get to ask this question.

05:01.209 --> 05:02.460
Like, how did you end up
doing "Harry Potter"?

05:02.543 --> 05:03.544
I ended up doing it

05:03.628 --> 05:04.754
because my daughter Eleanor

05:04.837 --> 05:06.422
convinced me to read the books

05:06.505 --> 05:08.299
after I refused three times.

05:08.382 --> 05:10.259
So once "Prisoner of Azkaban"
came out, I said...

05:10.343 --> 05:11.761
Thank you, Eleanor.

05:11.844 --> 05:14.972
I said, "Okay,
I'll read these, finally."

05:15.056 --> 05:17.058
And then immediately,
I saw the movies.

05:17.141 --> 05:19.477
I just saw them.
And that hasn't happened since.

05:19.560 --> 05:23.272
Then I had to fly to Edinburgh
to meet Jo Rowling

05:23.356 --> 05:26.901
and essentially said,
"This is my vision."

05:26.984 --> 05:29.278
She said, "That's exactly
the way I see the movie."

05:29.362 --> 05:30.821
<i>When the books came out,</i>

05:30.905 --> 05:32.990
the queues of kids
around the block...

05:33.074 --> 05:36.118
I mean, thousands of them
all waiting for the latest one.

05:41.123 --> 05:42.917
So many people were beginning
to fall in love

05:43.000 --> 05:44.627
with JK Rowling's writing.

05:44.710 --> 05:47.505
I think I probably would have
been about eight years old.

05:47.588 --> 05:49.632
I think that's when
the first one came out.

05:49.715 --> 05:51.801
<i>It became, like,
our family thing.</i>

05:51.884 --> 05:53.469
My dad used to do
all the voices,

05:53.552 --> 05:56.347
<i>and my brother and I
just became obsessed.</i>

05:56.430 --> 05:58.557
We would just beg him
to keep going.

05:58.641 --> 05:59.934
And every time
he finished a chapter,

06:00.017 --> 06:01.435
we'd be like, "One more,
one more, please.

06:01.519 --> 06:02.937
"Just one more.
Please, please, please.

06:03.020 --> 06:04.146
One more, one more,
one more, one more."

06:04.230 --> 06:05.523
<i>A friend of mine at school</i>

06:05.606 --> 06:07.316
<i>had the first two.</i>

06:07.400 --> 06:09.277
And I went for a sleepover
at his house and he said,

06:09.360 --> 06:11.487
"Well, 'Philosopher's Stone'
is there on the bookshelf."

06:11.570 --> 06:14.031
<i>That's what we did
the whole sleepover.</i>

06:14.115 --> 06:15.616
<i>We just both sat there
in silence,</i>

06:15.700 --> 06:16.993
him reading
"Chamber of Secrets,"

06:17.076 --> 06:18.494
me reading
"Philosopher's Stone."

06:18.577 --> 06:19.996
And that was it, really.
I never looked back.

06:20.079 --> 06:21.664
<i>At the time of reading,</i>

06:21.747 --> 06:23.332
we instantly related
to Fred and George

06:23.416 --> 06:25.042
because there aren't
many twins in literature.

06:25.126 --> 06:26.836
<i>"The Chamber of Secrets"
was the first book</i>

06:26.919 --> 06:29.839
that I sort of genuinely
stayed up at night reading.

06:29.922 --> 06:33.968
The writing was so vivid,
the characters so relatable.

06:34.051 --> 06:39.181
It was such a intricately,
perfectly designed universe.

06:39.265 --> 06:41.350
I think it's very easy
to forget that, at the time,

06:41.434 --> 06:43.269
people were talking about,
like, the death of reading.

06:43.352 --> 06:46.022
I just think it's a beautiful
creative outlook on life,

06:46.105 --> 06:48.316
this belief
in limitless possibilities.

06:48.399 --> 06:50.985
<i>One of the many reasons
I admired JK so much</i>

06:51.068 --> 06:53.487
<i>is that millions
would now read books</i>

06:53.571 --> 06:55.740
<i>who would never have lifted
a book up in their lives.</i>

06:55.823 --> 06:59.035
And you suddenly realize
the power of writing.

06:59.118 --> 07:00.369
Hip, hip, Harry!

07:00.453 --> 07:02.079
And then in terms of casting,

07:02.163 --> 07:06.751
it was... the search
for Harry Potter was insane.

07:06.834 --> 07:09.378
The new "Harry Potter" film
are looking for children

07:09.462 --> 07:13.799
to play the three main roles in
the multi-million-pound film.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.553
I remember going to the...
the very first audition,

07:17.636 --> 07:20.806
and there was hundreds
if not thousands of people.

07:20.890 --> 07:22.141
<i>And then we realized that</i>

07:22.224 --> 07:23.601
we were the only set
of twins there

07:23.684 --> 07:25.019
who weren't wearing
identical clothing.

07:25.102 --> 07:26.896
So we ended up
going over the road

07:26.979 --> 07:30.191
and bought two identical
matching tops.

07:30.274 --> 07:31.901
- Just off the rack.
- Just off the rack.

07:31.984 --> 07:32.985
We were like,
"Right, they will do."

07:33.069 --> 07:34.570
And then off we went.

07:34.653 --> 07:37.448
They'd let us all mill,
you know, sort of congregate

07:37.531 --> 07:39.408
till they "seemingly"
walked away,

07:39.492 --> 07:41.077
and, of course, while there's
still one gentleman

07:41.160 --> 07:43.746
holding a boom mic
straight over our heads.

07:43.829 --> 07:47.917
And this little girl
asked me, "What's that?"

07:48.000 --> 07:51.170
I think I even said,
"It's a mic, duh."

07:51.253 --> 07:52.463
I was like,
"They're filming us.

07:52.546 --> 07:53.923
This is just, like, a trick."

07:54.006 --> 07:55.674
Like, as if I'd done it
before, really.

07:55.758 --> 07:57.426
And I remember it,
'cause it was Emma.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.011
I became completely gripped

07:59.095 --> 08:02.223
by the excitement
around this audition.

08:02.306 --> 08:05.601
<i>And I always knew
that I was going for Hermione</i>

08:05.684 --> 08:07.436
<i>in a way that I think
terrified my parents</i>

08:07.520 --> 08:09.146
<i>because they were like,</i>

08:09.230 --> 08:12.024
"What are we gonna do with her
if she doesn't get the part?"

08:12.108 --> 08:13.192
I was just excited.

08:13.275 --> 08:14.527
I wasn't sort of daunted.

08:14.610 --> 08:16.112
I wasn't thinking,
"I wonder how many

08:16.195 --> 08:17.530
films they're gonna make,"
anything like that.

08:17.613 --> 08:19.031
I thought,
"Oh, this will be fun."

08:19.115 --> 08:20.991
I think the biggest pressure
at the beginning

08:21.075 --> 08:22.410
was who was gonna be
Harry Potter.

08:22.493 --> 08:23.828
We couldn't find Harry.

08:23.911 --> 08:25.955
We couldn't...
we just couldn't find Harry,

08:26.038 --> 08:27.581
and it was getting
kind of weird,

08:27.665 --> 08:28.958
um, and panicky.

08:29.041 --> 08:32.544
I was in my hotel room
in London one night

08:32.628 --> 08:34.880
watching the BBC version
of "David Copperfield."

08:34.964 --> 08:36.631
<i>Immediately, a light bulb
went off in my head,</i>

08:36.715 --> 08:38.592
<i>and I said,
"This is Harry Potter."</i>

08:38.676 --> 08:41.429
<i>This is the kid we've been
looking for for months.</i>

08:41.511 --> 08:43.139
So I asked
the casting director,

08:43.222 --> 08:45.307
I said, "We've gotta get him
in here for an audition."

08:45.391 --> 08:46.976
She said,
"It's never gonna happen.

08:47.059 --> 08:49.937
"His parents do not want him
involved in this world.

08:50.020 --> 08:51.480
They don't want him
to take this role."

08:51.564 --> 08:53.315
I think the deal
was to sign on for, like,

08:53.399 --> 08:55.526
all seven films and they would
be filmed in LA.

08:55.609 --> 08:57.236
So Mum and Dad were like,
"No, that's, like,

08:57.319 --> 08:58.863
a huge disruption to his life."

08:58.946 --> 09:01.323
Fortunately, David Heyman,

09:01.407 --> 09:03.993
uh, went to the theater
a few weeks later.

09:04.076 --> 09:05.828
These two guys
in the row in front of me

09:05.911 --> 09:07.329
started sort of turning round.

09:07.413 --> 09:09.457
<i>David, being the great
producer that he is,</i>

09:09.540 --> 09:13.335
convinced Dan's father to bring
Dan in for an audition.

09:13.419 --> 09:17.298
And that's basically
when we got our Harry Potter.

09:17.381 --> 09:18.883
And action.

09:18.966 --> 09:20.676
- That's a dragon egg.
- What is it?

09:20.759 --> 09:22.511
- That's what that is.
- What is that?

09:22.595 --> 09:23.637
A dragon egg.

09:23.721 --> 09:24.805
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

09:24.889 --> 09:26.182
I was a very happy kid who had

09:26.265 --> 09:28.184
a really haunted quality,
apparently.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.686
"You're really sweet,
but you looked like

09:30.769 --> 09:33.022
you had real, like,
stuff going on."

09:33.105 --> 09:36.025
It was very emotional,
actually, seeing this kid

09:36.108 --> 09:37.943
sitting there talking,
and I just thought,

09:38.027 --> 09:40.029
"Yeah, that's him.
Thank God we found him."

09:40.112 --> 09:43.365
Rupert and Emma
were very easy to cast

09:43.449 --> 09:45.284
because they felt like
they jumped off the page.

09:45.367 --> 09:47.036
<i>We screen-tested
the three of them together</i>

09:47.119 --> 09:49.038
<i>to make sure that
they all had this chemistry,</i>

09:49.121 --> 09:51.707
which immediately was obvious
in the first screen test.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.667
Remember, guys,
get closer to her

09:53.751 --> 09:55.419
as she finds out
the information.

09:55.503 --> 09:57.004
And action.

09:58.214 --> 10:00.549
I never thought
to look in here.

10:00.633 --> 10:03.886
I checked this out first term
for a bit of light reading.

10:03.969 --> 10:06.555
- This is light?
- Shut up.

10:06.639 --> 10:09.350
If Filch comes around
the corner any second now,

10:09.433 --> 10:12.353
at least 50 points
off Gryffindor.

10:14.939 --> 10:18.025
I knew it! Here it is.

10:18.108 --> 10:20.569
Nicholas Flamel
is the only known

10:20.653 --> 10:23.572
maker of the Sorcerer's Stone.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.074
The what?

10:25.157 --> 10:27.743
Oh, honestly,
don't you two read?

10:27.826 --> 10:29.870
Cut. Good job.

10:30.871 --> 10:32.039
It's lovely seeing you.

10:32.122 --> 10:34.041
Yeah, this is surreal,
isn't it?

10:34.124 --> 10:36.877
How do we all feel being back
and talking about this?

10:36.961 --> 10:40.005
Well, A, really emotional,
obviously.

10:40.089 --> 10:43.050
And B, um, it feels like
no time has passed

10:43.133 --> 10:46.220
and loads of time has passed
simultaneously.

10:46.303 --> 10:47.805
Yeah, kind of much the same.
It's quite surreal.

10:47.888 --> 10:50.015
It doesn't feel like
much time has passed.

10:50.099 --> 10:52.851
It doesn't feel like we've
kind of earned a reunion yet.

10:52.935 --> 10:54.228
- Yeah.
- I know.

10:54.311 --> 10:56.355
I have had kidney stones
and a baby,

10:56.438 --> 10:57.773
so time has obviously passed.

10:57.856 --> 10:59.692
- You did mention that.
- I feel my age.

10:59.775 --> 11:02.736
But there is, like,
such a collection

11:02.820 --> 11:04.613
of, like, shared memories
and stuff

11:04.697 --> 11:06.115
that we just all did together
that it is

11:06.198 --> 11:07.783
immediately
very easy to be, like...

11:07.866 --> 11:09.451
to sort of slip back
into where you were.

11:09.535 --> 11:11.996
Our first audition, the...
the day we all met...

11:12.079 --> 11:13.873
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- I think for the first time,

11:13.956 --> 11:15.624
there was, like, me walking
out of my dressing room

11:15.708 --> 11:17.585
and seeing, like,
another, like,

11:17.668 --> 11:19.461
young, brown-haired boy
going the other way.

11:19.545 --> 11:20.838
I never saw his face,
but I was like,

11:20.921 --> 11:22.131
"You are clearly another Harry

11:22.214 --> 11:23.632
that is being
tested out today."

11:23.716 --> 11:25.217
- And they were, like...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:25.301 --> 11:26.802
Testing us with various
different configurations

11:26.885 --> 11:27.886
of Ron, Harry, and Hermione.

11:27.970 --> 11:29.305
I remember there was one

11:29.388 --> 11:31.098
where they put all
the three of us together.

11:31.181 --> 11:33.934
I do remember that
when it was the three of us,

11:34.018 --> 11:36.770
- something felt different...
- Right. Yeah.

11:36.854 --> 11:39.481
And, like, right and easy.
I do remember the click.

11:39.565 --> 11:41.275
<i>We'd been out
at the studios.</i>

11:41.358 --> 11:43.694
They'd told us we got the parts
and they were like, "Cool.

11:43.777 --> 11:45.529
"So we're announcing
you've got the parts.

11:45.613 --> 11:48.324
There is now going to be a lot
of media outside your house."

11:48.407 --> 11:49.575
So you can't go home."

11:49.658 --> 11:51.035
So far, it's sort of

11:51.118 --> 11:53.912
turned things upside down.

11:53.996 --> 11:56.332
Um, it's... I don't know,

11:56.415 --> 11:59.126
I've never had anything
happen to me like this before.

11:59.209 --> 12:02.171
Hermione made
complete sense to me.

12:02.254 --> 12:03.797
<i>That's me.</i>

12:03.881 --> 12:05.507
<i>Like, I am that girl.</i>

12:05.591 --> 12:09.511
Well, Emma was arguably
the smartest person on the set,

12:09.595 --> 12:11.096
and I'm talking
about everybody.

12:11.180 --> 12:13.557
She just was...
she was a brilliant kid.

12:13.641 --> 12:16.060
I think I'm scarily
like my character.

12:17.978 --> 12:20.856
'Cause I live in a family
of, um, seven

12:20.939 --> 12:23.067
and, um, I've got
a redheaded sister

12:23.150 --> 12:24.443
and I live in a burrow.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.945
Rupert is just the most
camera-ready

12:27.029 --> 12:29.531
12-year-old boy in the world
at that point.

12:29.615 --> 12:34.078
Like, he was so,
like, just fearless.

12:34.161 --> 12:37.206
Rupert was Ron, you know,

12:37.289 --> 12:39.625
and Dan kind of was Harry.

12:39.708 --> 12:41.877
How do you feel
about becoming famous?

12:41.960 --> 12:44.296
It'd be cool.

12:44.380 --> 12:45.798
We were all talking about this,

12:45.881 --> 12:48.384
how comfortable you made us all
in our auditions

12:48.467 --> 12:49.635
and how, like, this, like,

12:49.718 --> 12:51.762
extended massively
into the set.

12:51.845 --> 12:54.556
My memory of it is that
it seemed effortless to you.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.851
Well, on the first film,
I was dying the entire time,

12:57.935 --> 12:59.728
but I just... I always believe

12:59.812 --> 13:01.605
you cannot bring
that kind of anxiety.

13:01.689 --> 13:03.440
I want everyone
to feel comfortable.

13:03.524 --> 13:05.150
I want everyone
to feel like it's a family.

13:05.234 --> 13:07.069
I want everyone
to feel like they're home.

13:28.382 --> 13:29.883
Hey, class, listen to me.

13:29.967 --> 13:31.468
Welcome to your first
flying lesson.

13:31.552 --> 13:34.096
I want you to raise your hand
over the broom.

13:34.179 --> 13:36.056
For the first several weeks
on the film,

13:36.140 --> 13:39.727
the kids
are basically in shock.

13:39.810 --> 13:42.438
<i>Looking back, I am sort
of amazed at the fact</i>

13:42.521 --> 13:44.648
<i>that I wasn't ever, like,
completely overwhelmed by it.</i>

13:44.732 --> 13:46.734
- Shh. Shh. Shh.
- Dan, when you turn away

13:46.817 --> 13:48.944
from her this time...
when you turn away,

13:49.027 --> 13:50.446
grab hold of this,

13:50.529 --> 13:52.573
and look up like you're
going to get it, okay?

13:52.656 --> 13:54.616
<i>But I also think
that was, again, part of Chris</i>

13:54.700 --> 13:56.076
and the whole crew just, like,

13:56.160 --> 13:57.703
they kept us having fun
the whole time.

13:57.786 --> 13:59.788
Obviously, we were just kids,
and we were all

13:59.872 --> 14:01.874
looking forward
to mucking about together.

14:01.957 --> 14:04.001
<i>Chris Columbus
made the atmosphere</i>

14:04.084 --> 14:05.669
<i>very much like a funfair.</i>

14:05.753 --> 14:09.089
We were very much just, like,
kids being kids on a set.

14:09.173 --> 14:10.591
- Mm-hmm.
- My residing memory

14:10.674 --> 14:13.010
from the first...
from "Philosopher's Stone"

14:13.093 --> 14:14.803
is I just learned
how to play slam.

14:14.887 --> 14:17.222
You know what we did a lot of
as well was that game.

14:17.306 --> 14:18.515
- Oh, my God.
- Slaps.

14:18.599 --> 14:19.975
- So much hand slaps.
- Oh, slaps.

14:20.058 --> 14:21.393
With, like, all of us,
like, red...

14:21.477 --> 14:23.145
like, red, raw hands
from, like,

14:23.228 --> 14:24.646
- hitting each other really hard.
- I think we also upgraded

14:24.730 --> 14:26.815
- to knuckles as well.
- Oh, and shins.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.233
- Yeah.
- I remember the shin version.

14:28.317 --> 14:30.068
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:31.195 --> 14:33.822
Sorry. Gotta give it back.

14:33.906 --> 14:36.533
I am the champion!

14:36.617 --> 14:39.161
They probably made their jobs
harder for themselves

14:39.244 --> 14:40.996
by letting us have
as much fun as we had

14:41.079 --> 14:42.623
because it distracted us from,

14:42.706 --> 14:44.249
you know, the work
we were supposed to be doing.

14:44.333 --> 14:47.085
And for the other viewers,
get a mousetrap.

14:47.169 --> 14:48.545
Darling, don't put it
on your nose.

14:48.629 --> 14:49.922
You're gonna remove
all your makeup.

14:50.005 --> 14:51.632
Like, a big problem
was, like,

14:51.715 --> 14:54.843
throughout a take,
our attention would, like...

14:54.927 --> 14:57.054
would wane and come and go.

14:57.137 --> 14:59.014
<i>They'd say a line and then
they'd smile at the camera</i>

14:59.097 --> 15:01.683
where they were just so happy
to be in a Harry Potter film

15:01.767 --> 15:04.228
<i>that they couldn't contain
their excitement long enough</i>

15:04.311 --> 15:06.188
<i>to focus on an entire scene.</i>

15:06.271 --> 15:07.773
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

15:07.856 --> 15:10.734
Columbus had worked
with kids a lot.

15:10.818 --> 15:12.778
And he was terrific with them.
He really was.

15:12.861 --> 15:15.364
He used to go down on his knees
to talk to them

15:15.447 --> 15:17.866
and huddle around
so nobody could hear.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.409
He was such a dad as well.

15:19.493 --> 15:20.953
Like, and I... you could
really feel that,

15:21.036 --> 15:23.705
like you were kind of
part of his family.

15:23.789 --> 15:26.041
Be a little looser with this.

15:26.124 --> 15:28.126
And just be talking,
you know what I'm saying?

15:28.210 --> 15:29.419
- Yeah.
- You go up and you're, like,

15:29.503 --> 15:31.255
frozen like this,
but you can be...

15:31.338 --> 15:32.673
"You really think"...

15:32.756 --> 15:34.758
"Of course I can use it,"
like this, okay?

15:34.842 --> 15:36.552
- Yeah.
- Good job, though.

15:36.635 --> 15:38.220
But it's not easy,
'cause it takes a tremendous

15:38.303 --> 15:40.389
amount of patience with kids,

15:40.472 --> 15:43.475
particularly with...
with kids as hyperactive

15:43.559 --> 15:44.893
and as excitable
as we all were.

15:47.229 --> 15:48.814
- Looking great.
- Well, they wanted to...

15:48.897 --> 15:50.315
Fancy seeing you boys here.

15:50.399 --> 15:52.943
- Hi.
- Snuck away.

15:53.026 --> 15:54.695
A couple of Gryffindors
just kicking it.

15:54.778 --> 15:56.572
- Come here.
- Good to see you, brother.

15:57.698 --> 16:00.868
How did Chris Columbus stay
is such good... good spirits?

16:00.951 --> 16:02.911
We sort of ran around.
I guess we were all, like, 11.

16:02.995 --> 16:05.205
You might get, like, three
people to do the right thing.

16:05.289 --> 16:06.665
But it doesn't mean you're
gonna get the other five

16:06.748 --> 16:08.125
in the background
doing the right thing.

16:08.208 --> 16:09.626
No. No. And Rupert
was... was relentless.

16:09.710 --> 16:11.253
Once he started...
once the flood gate open...

16:11.336 --> 16:13.005
- God, yeah.
- But that's the thing.

16:13.088 --> 16:14.590
That's the way it worked,
wasn't it?

16:14.673 --> 16:15.924
'Cause Columbus basically just

16:16.008 --> 16:17.426
- let us be kids.
- Yeah. True.

16:17.509 --> 16:19.303
I never recall feeling
like we were working.

16:19.386 --> 16:20.929
But that's so important,
isn't it, that we had that...

16:21.013 --> 16:22.431
Yeah. I think that's why
it feels that way

16:22.514 --> 16:23.724
when you watch it.
It feels like...

16:23.807 --> 16:25.267
- Yeah. That's true.
- Kids.

16:25.350 --> 16:26.602
I tell you what's funny
about that, though, is...

16:26.685 --> 16:28.270
is being surrounded
by all the...

16:28.353 --> 16:30.647
the cream of the, um,
the British acting industry

16:30.731 --> 16:32.733
and not having a clue
who anyone is.

16:32.816 --> 16:34.651
I thought... I thought
Richard Harris worked here

16:34.735 --> 16:36.820
as like... as a tour guide
for a while.

16:40.657 --> 16:43.577
<i>I don't think any of
the kids had the capability</i>

16:43.660 --> 16:45.329
of understanding the gravity

16:45.412 --> 16:47.247
of who they were
dealing with at the time.

16:47.331 --> 16:49.875
That was no stranger
Hagrid met in the village.

16:49.958 --> 16:51.627
It was Snape, which means

16:51.710 --> 16:53.670
he knows how to get past
Fluffy.

16:53.754 --> 16:55.172
And with Dumbledore gone...

16:55.255 --> 16:56.673
Good afternoon.

16:56.757 --> 16:59.301
<i>The British royalty
of the acting world.</i>

16:59.384 --> 17:00.886
<i>What have you got to say
for yourself?</i>

17:00.969 --> 17:02.554
<i>I swear I don't know
how it happened!</i>

17:02.638 --> 17:04.932
<i>When I think of the people
that I got to</i>

17:05.015 --> 17:08.268
just grow up around
and hear... hear them interact

17:08.352 --> 17:10.854
and hear the quickness
of people.

17:10.938 --> 17:13.397
<i>The adult actors came in</i>

17:13.482 --> 17:15.483
and were, like, the mischief
in a funny way.

17:18.111 --> 17:19.279
That's actually great.

17:19.363 --> 17:20.821
Like Robbie Coltrane.

17:20.906 --> 17:21.949
He was such a kid.

17:22.031 --> 17:23.825
Like, so immature

17:23.909 --> 17:27.329
and, like, just so much fun.

17:27.412 --> 17:28.580
He loved making us laugh,

17:28.664 --> 17:30.457
and he was
incredibly good at it.

17:30.540 --> 17:32.709
I've tried
absolutely everything.

17:32.793 --> 17:35.379
I've tried creams.
I've tried jellies.

17:35.462 --> 17:36.838
I tried shaving.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.715
Every moment...
I woke up, it's like...

17:38.799 --> 17:40.968
my husband is threatening
to leave me.

17:41.051 --> 17:42.511
If he really loved me,

17:42.594 --> 17:44.888
he wouldn't mind a little
facial hair, I'm sure.

17:44.972 --> 17:47.349
But he's being very,
very difficult.

17:50.394 --> 17:52.854
That, like, kindness
and that warmth from you...

17:52.938 --> 17:55.190
- Aww.
- It made all the difference.

17:55.273 --> 17:57.025
Well, we spent
so much time together.

17:57.109 --> 17:59.236
I know. I know.
I spent more time with you

17:59.319 --> 18:01.029
than I did with my own
children at one point.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.114
I know. Wild.

18:02.197 --> 18:03.740
Ooh. I know.

18:03.824 --> 18:05.575
I think most of my
favorite scenes, if I'm honest,

18:05.659 --> 18:08.996
looking back, are with you
and the gang in Hagrid's hut.

18:09.079 --> 18:10.956
I keep thinking
about that scene

18:11.039 --> 18:12.541
- where I get called a mudblood.
- Yes.

18:12.624 --> 18:14.835
And you were so sweet
with me that day.

18:14.918 --> 18:17.045
'Cause it was, like, my first,
like, you know,

18:17.129 --> 18:18.463
big piece of acting.

18:23.093 --> 18:24.428
He called me a mudblood.

18:24.511 --> 18:26.888
He did not.

18:26.972 --> 18:28.223
What's a mudblood?

18:28.306 --> 18:30.142
It means dirty blood.

18:30.225 --> 18:33.061
Mudblood's a really foul name
for someone who is Muggle-born.

18:33.145 --> 18:36.481
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

18:36.565 --> 18:38.692
The three of you have become
such great actors.

18:38.775 --> 18:40.110
Being on that set,

18:40.193 --> 18:42.279
you felt like you actually
entered the world.

18:42.362 --> 18:43.530
Yeah.

18:43.613 --> 18:45.032
With all of Stuart Craig's
sets,

18:45.115 --> 18:46.533
the attention to detail
was phenomenal.

18:51.329 --> 18:54.583
I was always adamant
that Hogwarts shouldn't feel

18:54.666 --> 18:58.837
as if it's a world
that couldn't exist in reality.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.089
<i>I had a tremendous amount
of creative freedom,</i>

19:01.173 --> 19:04.426
<i>so we could build this world
from the ground up.</i>

19:04.509 --> 19:07.304
<i>Some of the sets on "Potter"
were overwhelming to me,</i>

19:07.387 --> 19:08.889
<i>and I'd been doing it
for 35 years.</i>

19:08.972 --> 19:10.265
You know? "Oh, blimey."

19:10.348 --> 19:12.934
The very first time
I visited the set,

19:13.018 --> 19:14.811
they walked me through
the Great Hall,

19:14.895 --> 19:18.106
which was mind-blowing.

19:18.190 --> 19:20.609
<i>All the floors
are real Yorkstone.</i>

19:20.692 --> 19:22.778
<i>A lot of those scenes
with 250 extras,</i>

19:22.861 --> 19:24.654
<i>they're all about 18
and trampling 'round.</i>

19:24.738 --> 19:26.364
<i>You're not gonna put
a plastic floor down.</i>

19:26.448 --> 19:28.158
<i>It's gotta be the real stuff.</i>

19:28.241 --> 19:30.786
<i>And all these lit candles
going up and down on wires.</i>

19:30.869 --> 19:32.496
<i>One of my favorite
moments on set ever</i>

19:32.579 --> 19:34.122
<i>was the moment
when all the floating candles</i>

19:34.206 --> 19:35.832
started burning through
the ropes that tied them

19:35.916 --> 19:37.459
to the ceiling
and just started falling

19:37.542 --> 19:39.795
- around the Great Hall.
- Hundreds of real candles

19:39.878 --> 19:41.588
- that were really lit...
- "Oh, my God."

19:41.671 --> 19:44.633
On fishing line
from the ceiling.

19:44.716 --> 19:46.468
So much of that would
be visual effects now.

19:46.551 --> 19:48.053
The fact that we got
to actually be on that set...

19:48.136 --> 19:49.805
Actually, that's so true.
That's so cool.

19:49.888 --> 19:51.348
- Thank you, Stuart Craig.
- Yeah.

19:51.431 --> 19:52.974
- Yeah.
- We love you, Stuart Craig.

20:03.318 --> 20:05.237
<i>The hardest scene to shoot
was Quidditch.</i>

20:05.320 --> 20:06.488
And the audience had to

20:06.571 --> 20:07.989
understand the rules
immediately.

20:08.073 --> 20:10.534
Quidditch is easy enough
to understand.

20:10.617 --> 20:14.162
Each team has seven players:
three chasers, two beaters,

20:14.246 --> 20:16.832
one keeper,
and the seeker... that's you.

20:16.915 --> 20:20.210
So Jo Rowling basically did
a rule book for us.

20:20.293 --> 20:21.586
A Quidditch rule book

20:21.670 --> 20:24.840
explaining every detail
of the game.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.800
<i>Then, with Stuart Craig,
our production designer,</i>

20:26.883 --> 20:29.010
<i>designed the look
of the Quidditch pitch</i>

20:29.094 --> 20:34.015
<i>and really create a pitch
that felt authentic and real</i>

20:34.099 --> 20:37.018
<i>for a game
that is completely unreal.</i>

20:37.102 --> 20:40.021
Lots of energy, enthusiasm.

20:40.105 --> 20:41.523
Set and action!

20:41.606 --> 20:44.484
- She scores!
- Angelina Johnson scores!

20:44.568 --> 20:46.278
Ten points for Gryffindor.

20:46.361 --> 20:47.529
I always wanted
to tell you this,

20:47.612 --> 20:48.947
but there was a moment,
you know,

20:49.030 --> 20:50.323
on day two maybe or three,

20:50.407 --> 20:53.034
the camera pushes into you
and you say,

20:53.118 --> 20:54.578
"We're not going home,
not really."

20:54.661 --> 20:58.165
Feels strange to be
going home, doesn't it?

20:58.248 --> 21:00.417
I'm not going home.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.335
Not really.

21:02.419 --> 21:04.004
I got tears...
I still get tears in my eyes

21:04.087 --> 21:06.381
thinking about it.
I thought, "This guy...

21:06.464 --> 21:08.383
this kid is an amazing actor."

21:08.466 --> 21:10.635
- Oh, that's...
- And it was that moment

21:10.719 --> 21:12.846
that kind of opened up
the whole world for us.

21:12.929 --> 21:15.599
And the first film was very
storybook, very inviting.

21:15.682 --> 21:16.892
Yeah, it's lovely and...

21:16.975 --> 21:18.268
It's like,
"Welcome to Hogwarts."

21:18.351 --> 21:19.728
Until you get to the end
of the movie.

21:19.811 --> 21:21.354
And where a man...
I melt a man's face.

21:21.438 --> 21:22.731
Yes, exactly.

21:26.902 --> 21:29.654
- The first film was a hit.
- Yep.

21:29.738 --> 21:32.282
So once it became a hit
and people accepted

21:32.365 --> 21:33.575
not only the film

21:33.658 --> 21:35.076
- but accepted the cast...
- Right, yeah.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.703
I had a ball
on the second film,

21:36.786 --> 21:39.206
"The Chamber of Secrets,"
'cause I was, like, free.

22:03.146 --> 22:06.191
Okay, come on. Shh, shh.

22:06.274 --> 22:07.817
Okay, come on.

22:09.361 --> 22:10.403
Shh, come on.

22:12.197 --> 22:14.115
Morning, Weasleys.

22:14.199 --> 22:15.784
Morning, Dad.

22:15.867 --> 22:19.079
I always loved any scene
where the kind of Weasleys

22:19.162 --> 22:20.622
were together,
like the Burrow scenes.

22:20.705 --> 22:22.290
<i>It just had
this frenetic energy.</i>

22:22.374 --> 22:25.126
<i>Everyone kind of played
off each other.</i>

22:25.210 --> 22:27.128
The thing about the Burrow
as I remember is that

22:27.212 --> 22:28.421
it changed all the time.

22:28.505 --> 22:30.090
It sort of expanded
and contracted.

22:30.173 --> 22:32.926
One minute, there was a huge
fireplace of floo powder

22:33.009 --> 22:36.221
and then there was just...
and then it got smaller.

22:36.304 --> 22:39.015
Yeah, it was like a living,
breathing set that changed.

22:39.099 --> 22:40.350
I feel like being a Weasley

22:40.433 --> 22:41.935
is the best part
of being in Harry Potter.

22:42.018 --> 22:44.354
We had, like, our Hogwarts
family but I felt, like,

22:44.437 --> 22:46.940
so special having
an actual extra family.

22:47.023 --> 22:48.525
- It was great.
- All these scenes that we got

22:48.608 --> 22:49.818
on top of everything else.

22:49.901 --> 22:51.611
Julie's brilliant
to work with.

22:51.695 --> 22:54.948
We used to... Ron would say,
"Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy."

22:55.031 --> 22:57.575
Julie Walters who played
my mother, Mrs. Weasley,

22:57.659 --> 23:00.453
was... was just so wonderful
and brilliant to me.

23:00.537 --> 23:02.497
<i>She really kind of took me
under her wing</i>

23:02.580 --> 23:04.874
and she just was, like,
the perfect mother figure.

23:04.958 --> 23:07.502
<i>The twins were two people
that I was really close with.</i>

23:07.585 --> 23:09.504
They really were like
older brothers.

23:09.587 --> 23:11.673
<i>Julie Walters
and Mark Williams,</i>

23:11.756 --> 23:13.383
<i>they were like
my second family.</i>

23:13.466 --> 23:14.884
They were always kind of
staying in character

23:14.968 --> 23:16.678
and they would have
this kind of...

23:16.761 --> 23:18.221
they would
bounce off each other.

23:18.305 --> 23:20.390
Dumbled... dom... mith.

23:20.473 --> 23:22.183
Who? Who, dear?

23:22.267 --> 23:24.185
Dumbledore must know
you're here, Harry.

23:25.770 --> 23:27.063
Cut.

23:27.147 --> 23:28.773
Stop, stop.

23:28.857 --> 23:30.525
This isn't working.

23:30.608 --> 23:31.693
Can't believe it.

23:31.776 --> 23:33.236
- You guys look great.
- Hello.

23:33.320 --> 23:34.779
How are you?
This is amazing.

23:34.863 --> 23:36.031
- How're you guys doing?
- Very well, thank you.

23:36.114 --> 23:37.490
- How are you?
- Good.

23:37.574 --> 23:39.200
- This is so exciting.
- Yeah.

23:39.284 --> 23:40.618
It's the first time
I've been back since "Azkaban."

23:40.702 --> 23:42.370
We didn't know
you were gonna come back.

23:42.454 --> 23:46.207
<i>The Weasley family values
were consideration,</i>

23:46.291 --> 23:48.835
thoughtfulness, and fun!

23:48.918 --> 23:52.339
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

23:52.422 --> 23:56.051
Tell me, what exactly is
the function of a rubber duck?

23:56.134 --> 23:58.678
<i>It's just very natural
when we were all together.</i>

23:58.762 --> 24:01.848
It was a family,
you know, in all but name.

24:01.931 --> 24:03.475
That's the cool thing about
it as well is that you see

24:03.558 --> 24:06.519
that... that motion
where they are very inclusive

24:06.603 --> 24:09.731
and then you see the complete
opposite with the Malfoys.

24:09.814 --> 24:11.816
Yeah, it's always such
a good comparison,

24:11.900 --> 24:13.151
the two families side by side.

24:13.234 --> 24:14.903
A real chalk and cheese
side of it.

24:14.986 --> 24:17.739
Not now, Draco. Play nicely.

24:19.449 --> 24:22.077
Mr. Potter.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.621
Lucius Malfoy.

24:24.704 --> 24:26.373
We meet at last.

24:26.456 --> 24:27.874
I was first aware
of Harry Potter

24:27.957 --> 24:29.417
because everybody
was reading the books

24:29.501 --> 24:31.336
on the tube everywhere I went.

24:31.419 --> 24:33.088
<i>I'm convinced I ended up
playing Lucius</i>

24:33.171 --> 24:34.672
<i>because I didn't want to.</i>

24:34.756 --> 24:36.299
<i>I went to audition
for Gilderoy Lockhart</i>

24:36.383 --> 24:37.926
<i>and Chris said,
"That was great.</i>

24:38.009 --> 24:39.594
<i>Would you mind reading
a different part?"</i>

24:39.677 --> 24:41.805
I was about to play
Captain Hook in "Peter Pan"

24:41.888 --> 24:43.098
and I thought,
"Well, I don't wanna play

24:43.181 --> 24:44.599
two children's villains."

24:44.682 --> 24:47.227
<i>And I read
through gritted teeth.</i>

24:47.310 --> 24:48.770
<i>I was deeply bitter,</i>

24:48.853 --> 24:51.064
and, of course, that's exactly
what was necessary,

24:51.147 --> 24:54.442
and they asked me to play
Lucius, and thank God they did.

24:54.526 --> 24:56.444
How dare you?

24:56.528 --> 24:58.655
<i>The point of him
being in the story to me</i>

24:58.738 --> 25:01.700
was to explain why Draco
was such a horrible,

25:01.783 --> 25:04.911
<i>heartless,
sadistic bully at school.</i>

25:04.994 --> 25:07.831
Red hair
and a hand-me-down robe?

25:07.914 --> 25:10.083
You must be a Weasley.

25:10.166 --> 25:12.210
He's a product
of his parents, Draco,

25:12.293 --> 25:15.296
<i>and he's got
really bad parents.</i>

25:15.380 --> 25:17.090
If Hagrid
was your first influence,

25:17.173 --> 25:18.466
chances are, you're gonna be...

25:18.550 --> 25:19.968
"All right there, mate."

25:20.051 --> 25:21.511
You're gonna be lovely
and... and very huggy.

25:21.594 --> 25:24.180
Isn't he beautiful?
Oh, bless him.

25:24.264 --> 25:27.600
Look, he knows his mummy.

25:27.684 --> 25:29.477
Ooh!

25:30.562 --> 25:32.147
If your dad is a psychopath

25:32.230 --> 25:34.691
wielding a cobra cane about,

25:34.774 --> 25:36.985
you're probably not gonna be
the friendliest geezer.

25:37.068 --> 25:39.362
37, take one.
Camera mark.

25:39.446 --> 25:43.533
Tom, remember, slow.
You're telling a tale.

25:43.616 --> 25:47.162
But sinister, soft.
Set and action.

25:47.245 --> 25:49.497
<i>I adored Tom
from the second I met him.</i>

25:49.581 --> 25:52.459
He was always just
the biggest sweetheart.

25:52.542 --> 25:55.170
Working with Jason
was a real treat.

25:56.254 --> 25:58.715
In fact, working with Jason
was not always a treat.

25:58.798 --> 26:03.219
Just immediately turned
into the most unfriendly,

26:03.303 --> 26:05.430
horrible person I've ever met.

26:05.513 --> 26:08.224
<i>I just remember grabbing him
and... and just being</i>

26:08.308 --> 26:10.059
<i>as unpleasant
as I possibly could</i>

26:10.143 --> 26:13.021
and watching his little face
constantly seeking my approval.

26:13.104 --> 26:15.773
The very first scene
that I shot was actually cut

26:15.857 --> 26:17.358
and is on the deleted scenes.

26:17.442 --> 26:19.652
<i>Draco touched something,
and I used this cane</i>

26:19.736 --> 26:20.820
<i>and I went...</i>

26:20.904 --> 26:23.364
Don't touch anything, Draco.

26:23.448 --> 26:25.492
But I didn't know
how sharp the teeth were

26:25.575 --> 26:27.619
and they went right
into little Tom's hands

26:27.702 --> 26:31.039
and he looked up at me
and his eyes welled with tears.

26:31.122 --> 26:32.540
Yes, Father.

26:32.624 --> 26:34.459
And I went, "Tom, I'm so
sorry, I didn't realize

26:34.542 --> 26:36.252
how sharp they were
and how heavy it was."

26:36.336 --> 26:37.879
And he went,
"No, no, it's all right.

26:37.962 --> 26:39.005
It was good for the scene."

26:39.088 --> 26:40.548
He'd be this evil father,

26:40.632 --> 26:42.091
<i>and then they'd say, "Cut."</i>

26:42.175 --> 26:43.718
And he'll come and give you
a cuddle and say,

26:43.801 --> 26:45.553
"Oh, did I hit you too hard?
Did I hit you too hard?"

26:45.637 --> 26:48.556
He's a real, you know,
Jekyll and Hyde, that one.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.686
Yeah! Yeah!

26:53.770 --> 26:56.606
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

26:56.689 --> 26:58.816
Harry Potter.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.610
Such an honor it is.

27:00.693 --> 27:02.403
I remember saying
to a friend,

27:02.487 --> 27:06.157
"You know, I've got this part.
It's an elf in Harry Potter."

27:06.241 --> 27:11.996
And the squeals of joy
and the complete despair

27:12.080 --> 27:15.166
at my not understanding,
you know,

27:15.250 --> 27:17.502
how important
this character was.

27:20.838 --> 27:22.423
We did a take and he goes,

27:22.507 --> 27:24.384
"Thank you, this will be all,"
and I swung my leg out,

27:24.467 --> 27:26.427
and I stepped down
and I swung my stick,

27:26.511 --> 27:28.012
and Chris goes, "Cut.

27:28.096 --> 27:29.931
Can we clean the floor
where Jason slipped, please?"

27:30.014 --> 27:31.683
And I said,
"No, I didn't slip."

27:31.766 --> 27:33.268
He said, "Well, what happened?"

27:33.351 --> 27:35.687
And I said, "I kicked Dobby
down the stairs."

27:42.110 --> 27:44.028
And I just thought,
"This is gonna be

27:44.112 --> 27:46.364
ridiculously good fun."

27:46.447 --> 27:48.783
Mr. Malfoy.

27:48.866 --> 27:51.369
Mr. Malfoy!

27:51.452 --> 27:53.913
I have something of yours.

27:55.039 --> 27:57.500
The sock is pathetic,
isn't it, on one level?

27:57.584 --> 27:59.669
<i>But on another level,
it's everything,</i>

27:59.752 --> 28:03.131
<i>and that's, I think,
the beauty of the character.</i>

28:03.214 --> 28:06.509
Master has given Dobby
a sock?

28:06.593 --> 28:08.678
What? I didn't g...

28:08.761 --> 28:12.807
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

28:12.890 --> 28:15.810
Dobby is free.

28:15.893 --> 28:17.854
One of the major themes
is this alliance

28:17.937 --> 28:20.356
of friends who endure.

28:34.662 --> 28:37.665
So you and I had one of
our greatest laughs together...

28:37.749 --> 28:39.208
- Yes.
- With Richard Harris.

28:39.292 --> 28:42.253
<i>And we had
a animatronic version</i>

28:42.337 --> 28:43.588
<i>of Fawkes the phoenix</i>

28:43.671 --> 28:45.381
and it was this bird...
big, red bird

28:45.465 --> 28:46.841
- that doesn't exist in life.
- That does not exist.

28:46.924 --> 28:48.551
It's not...
it wasn't unrealistic.

28:48.635 --> 28:50.219
Like, it could, I guess.

28:50.303 --> 28:53.890
<i>Richard came in and looked
at the phoenix and said,</i>

28:53.973 --> 28:57.018
"Wow, they train these animals
marvelously these days."

28:57.101 --> 28:58.811
<i>'Cause they had a camera
inside the eyes,</i>

28:58.895 --> 29:00.688
<i>so they could see
Richard looking at it,</i>

29:00.772 --> 29:02.106
<i>and then they were like,</i>

29:02.190 --> 29:04.484
<i>"Well, we don't wanna
break the spell,</i>

29:04.567 --> 29:06.319
so we'll just keep the bird
reacting and moving."

29:06.402 --> 29:08.279
And then that, of course,
you know, got into a cycle

29:08.363 --> 29:10.365
where Richard was like,
"The bird is responding to me."

29:10.448 --> 29:14.577
Ah, fascinating creatures,
phoenixes.

29:14.661 --> 29:18.039
They can carry
immensely heavy loads,

29:18.122 --> 29:21.501
and their... their tears
have healing powers.

29:21.584 --> 29:23.044
- We never told him.
- No, we never told him.

29:23.127 --> 29:24.170
- No.
- He just thought it was

29:24.253 --> 29:25.588
- a real bird.
- Yeah.

29:25.672 --> 29:27.173
It was insane
that we were part of that.

29:27.256 --> 29:28.925
You know, I do not know
of another human being

29:29.008 --> 29:30.510
that could have started
the series in the way you did.

29:30.593 --> 29:31.969
Well, that...
that makes me feel great.

29:32.053 --> 29:33.304
I've always felt guilty
about leaving.

29:33.388 --> 29:34.722
- I really did.
- Don't.

29:34.806 --> 29:37.308
When I said goodbye
to you guys, I was like,

29:37.392 --> 29:39.394
"I can't believe
I'm leaving these guys."

29:39.477 --> 29:41.229
And I think you honestly...
I don't think you ever

29:41.312 --> 29:44.148
get enough credit for, like,
what you achieved

29:44.232 --> 29:46.275
on those first two
and with all of us,

29:46.359 --> 29:47.819
and so thank you
so much for that.

29:47.902 --> 29:50.571
It's been the greatest
experience of my life.

29:53.241 --> 29:56.661
<i>You fail to recognize
that it matters not</i>

29:56.744 --> 29:59.956
<i>what someone is born...</i>

30:00.039 --> 30:02.917
<i>but what they grow to be.</i>

30:11.676 --> 30:14.345
Hello.

30:17.348 --> 30:19.767
Oh, thank you for coming.

30:19.851 --> 30:21.352
Thanks for chatting.

30:23.020 --> 30:26.482
Who is that? That man.

30:26.566 --> 30:28.109
Who is that?

30:28.192 --> 30:30.820
<i>That is Sirius Black, that is.</i>

30:32.530 --> 30:35.283
<i>Sirius Black is an essential
character for Harry.</i>

30:35.366 --> 30:36.784
It's part of Jo's themes of

30:36.868 --> 30:38.619
"Don't judge a book
by its cover," you know?

30:38.703 --> 30:40.455
The image of Sirius Black
as a criminal

30:40.538 --> 30:42.665
is one that's presented
to Harry.

30:42.749 --> 30:44.792
We have a killer
on the loose.

30:44.876 --> 30:46.794
Sirius Black, you mean?

30:46.878 --> 30:48.588
But what's he got
to do with me?

30:48.671 --> 30:50.882
<i>And yet,
when Harry meets him</i>

30:50.965 --> 30:53.009
<i>and through the course
of the third film,</i>

30:53.092 --> 30:56.804
he comes to learn that he's not
who he has been told he was.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.639
He's somebody very different.

30:58.723 --> 31:01.601
<i>And Gary is such
a remarkable actor.</i>

31:01.684 --> 31:03.644
One of the reasons we
chose him is he obviously

31:03.728 --> 31:06.147
has the potential for darkness,

31:06.230 --> 31:11.819
but he has such soul
and has such a warmth within.

31:11.903 --> 31:13.654
Can I ask you, when were...

31:13.738 --> 31:15.698
were you first
approached to be Sirius?

31:15.782 --> 31:17.325
I was aware of Harry Potter,

31:17.408 --> 31:20.828
but it... it was very much
a sort of kids' thing.

31:20.912 --> 31:24.332
People were telling me to read
the books and I had kids,

31:24.415 --> 31:27.335
so it was gonna be
in my universe somewhere.

31:27.418 --> 31:31.214
And then they were taking
a slightly darker approach.

31:31.297 --> 31:32.882
- Yeah.
- The book was interesting.

31:32.965 --> 31:35.468
I met Alfonso,
and I think at the time,

31:35.551 --> 31:36.844
he was the main attraction.

31:36.928 --> 31:38.554
Now, remember, guys,
that you have to

31:38.638 --> 31:40.807
- take care of your frogs.
- Yeah. Don't worry.

31:40.890 --> 31:44.435
For "Azkaban,"
it's a coming of age.

31:44.519 --> 31:47.772
<i>They're passing the threshold
between childhood</i>

31:47.855 --> 31:50.608
<i>and their teenage years.</i>

31:50.691 --> 31:54.028
In the first two,
Harry is still a child.

31:54.111 --> 32:00.368
<i>There is a greater optimism
around the tone itself.</i>

32:00.451 --> 32:03.120
<i>Nevertheless,
when he turns 13,</i>

32:03.204 --> 32:04.455
<i>there's a big cloud</i>

32:04.539 --> 32:07.375
that overshadows
everything around Harry,

32:07.458 --> 32:11.045
and we needed to convey that
also stylistically.

32:19.762 --> 32:21.889
What's going on?

32:21.973 --> 32:25.309
Don't know,
maybe we've broken down.

32:33.359 --> 32:38.155
<i>"Prisoner of Azkaban" felt
like a whole new era, really.</i>

32:38.239 --> 32:40.908
It was a much darker
kind of story.

32:40.992 --> 32:43.744
There was a lot of kind of
quite adult themes in it.

32:43.828 --> 32:46.247
<i>The descriptions
that JK Rowling</i>

32:46.330 --> 32:49.083
has of the dementors
are very scary,

32:49.166 --> 32:53.129
<i>and I really wanted to convey
the sense that the dementors,</i>

32:53.212 --> 32:57.592
what they do is they suck
all the joy away,

32:57.675 --> 33:02.013
<i>that they were sucking
an essence of Harry.</i>

33:02.096 --> 33:05.099
<i>But I think that the most
important piece</i>

33:05.182 --> 33:08.352
<i>to achieve that
was Dan's performance.</i>

33:09.896 --> 33:12.940
When was "Azkaban"...
how old were you?

33:13.024 --> 33:14.275
14.

33:14.358 --> 33:15.568
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:15.651 --> 33:17.153
- When we first met?
- Yeah.

33:17.236 --> 33:20.615
I think I had a natural
sort of paternal thing.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.831
Are you going to kill me,
Harry?

33:28.915 --> 33:30.750
The first person I remember
being, like,

33:30.833 --> 33:32.668
in order of when they came in
was Gary.

33:32.752 --> 33:34.253
I remember that. I remember...

33:34.337 --> 33:36.797
I remember you
giving me the Gary chat.

33:36.881 --> 33:39.467
Yeah, you were like, "Listen,
Emma, you need to be cool,

33:39.550 --> 33:42.011
"because Gary Oldman...
it's a really big deal,

33:42.094 --> 33:44.597
and you need to be cool,"
and I was like, "Okay."

33:44.680 --> 33:46.349
And which was... which
was really a projection

33:46.432 --> 33:48.100
of my own fears
'cause I was like,

33:48.184 --> 33:51.103
"Dan, you need to be cool.
This guy's a big deal."

33:52.229 --> 33:54.815
<i>Dan was first a bit daunted.</i>

33:54.899 --> 33:58.319
And Gary was amazingly generous
as a person,

33:58.402 --> 34:01.197
but also as an actor,
and immediately embrace him

34:01.280 --> 34:04.325
<i>and include him
in... in the acting process.</i>

34:04.408 --> 34:07.620
It was really sweet
to... to see the two of them.

34:07.703 --> 34:12.166
And it was almost as if it was
mirroring that relationship

34:12.248 --> 34:15.210
<i>because, in many ways,
Harry has made a totem</i>

34:15.293 --> 34:17.170
<i>out of Sirius Black.</i>

34:17.254 --> 34:20.466
That totem
that is kind of unapproachable

34:20.549 --> 34:22.510
and in many ways scary.

34:22.592 --> 34:24.804
<i>And then that was not unlike
in the film</i>

34:24.887 --> 34:27.431
<i>that when they discover
who they truly are,</i>

34:27.514 --> 34:30.016
<i>is when suddenly
there's an amazing bond.</i>

34:30.101 --> 34:32.268
You saw them between takes

34:32.353 --> 34:35.106
sitting with each other,
talking and laughing.

34:35.188 --> 34:38.025
<i>And you could see in the way
that Dan looked at Gary</i>

34:38.109 --> 34:41.862
<i>the adulation and the respect
that he had for him.</i>

34:41.946 --> 34:43.531
All the stuff in
the Shrieking Shack at the end,

34:43.614 --> 34:45.199
I feel like me and Rupert
and Emma were just, like,

34:45.282 --> 34:46.409
watching tennis in that scene
just being like,

34:46.492 --> 34:47.952
"This is acting, guys.

34:48.034 --> 34:50.036
This is what we all need
to be working towards."

34:50.121 --> 34:52.206
<i>There was Tim Spall,</i>

34:52.289 --> 34:54.166
- <i>the one and only Alan Rickman.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

34:54.250 --> 34:58.212
David Thewlis, you,
Emma, Rupert.

34:58.296 --> 35:00.047
It's really nice of you
to include me, Emma, and Rupert

35:00.131 --> 35:01.173
in that group.

35:01.257 --> 35:02.633
<i>To watch you guys act but also</i>

35:02.717 --> 35:04.343
<i>just watching
you guys as people</i>

35:04.427 --> 35:06.554
and just watching these,
like, incredible actors

35:06.637 --> 35:08.222
who were just like,
"Oh, yeah, no.

35:08.305 --> 35:10.141
"You're just people
and you'd have fun in between

35:10.224 --> 35:11.976
<i>and the whole process
doesn't have to be painful."</i>

35:12.059 --> 35:13.936
<i>It can be intense
and you showed me the wonders</i>

35:14.020 --> 35:16.397
<i>of that sometimes as well
and that was really important.</i>

35:16.480 --> 35:18.065
- Let's kill him!
- Wait.

35:18.149 --> 35:23.362
I did my waiting!
12 years of it!

35:23.446 --> 35:25.156
In Azkaban!

35:25.239 --> 35:26.615
I have never done a scene

35:26.699 --> 35:29.035
with such an amazing cast
in my life.

35:29.118 --> 35:30.703
<i>It's a very long scene.</i>

35:30.786 --> 35:32.663
<i>It's a scene in which
there are a lot of twists</i>

35:32.747 --> 35:35.207
<i>inside the scene,
and it was so much fun.</i>

35:35.291 --> 35:38.878
It's an intense scene in which
a lot of things are at stake.

35:38.961 --> 35:41.422
No! I trusted you!

35:41.505 --> 35:45.009
<i>And you can see...
Rupert and Emma and Dan...</i>

35:45.092 --> 35:48.095
<i>that they are completely
committed to this scene.</i>

35:48.179 --> 35:51.599
I love it. I-I have such
a great memory of it.

35:51.682 --> 35:54.226
I told Dumbledore
you were helping an old friend

35:54.310 --> 35:56.771
into the castle,
and now here's the proof.

35:56.854 --> 35:58.814
Brilliant, Snape.
Once again,

35:58.898 --> 36:00.816
you've put your keen and
penetrating mind to the task,

36:00.900 --> 36:03.110
and as usual,
come to the wrong conclusion.

36:03.986 --> 36:05.821
<i>I always loved
the character of Sirius.</i>

36:05.905 --> 36:07.615
I love the relationship
Harry and Sirius have.

36:07.698 --> 36:11.577
He's like this cool uncle,
but also older brother figure.

36:11.660 --> 36:14.288
<i>He's painted
as this villainous guy</i>

36:14.372 --> 36:16.874
<i>and then has the switch
where you go,</i>

36:16.957 --> 36:19.960
<i>"Oh, he was set up
and he's a good guy."</i>

36:20.044 --> 36:21.462
<i>And he's so kind
and so warm...</i>

36:21.545 --> 36:22.797
- And he's warm and kind...
- And cool.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.673
- And he's kinda cool.
- Yeah.

36:24.757 --> 36:27.676
I wish I'd had
the whole picture.

36:27.760 --> 36:29.678
You know, we only
ever found out book...

36:29.762 --> 36:31.097
Yeah, book by book.

36:31.180 --> 36:32.598
- I don't know whether you...
- I did not.

36:32.681 --> 36:34.058
Because you were
Harry Potter, you had a...

36:34.141 --> 36:35.392
Just Rickman.
Rickman did. That was it.

36:35.476 --> 36:37.103
- Rickman?
- He had the inside line.

36:37.186 --> 36:38.395
He worked that well.

36:38.479 --> 36:40.189
He very, very early
said to Jo,

36:40.272 --> 36:42.733
he was like, "I think I need
to know what happens."

36:42.817 --> 36:44.151
I need to know.

36:45.402 --> 36:48.739
Give me a reason. I beg you.

36:48.823 --> 36:50.449
<i>Rickman would have an in,
wouldn't he?</i>

36:50.533 --> 36:51.784
He did, yeah.

36:51.867 --> 36:53.327
And he never told Chris,
never told anyone.

36:53.410 --> 36:54.787
He would... Chris would
literally say to him,

36:54.870 --> 36:56.080
"Why are you doing that
like that?"

36:56.163 --> 36:57.623
He'd say,
"I'll tell you later."

37:02.169 --> 37:04.880
Yeah, "You'll find out
on a need-to-know basis."

37:04.964 --> 37:06.382
Wait a decade.

37:06.465 --> 37:10.261
Dan was not a child actor.
Was another fellow actor.

37:10.344 --> 37:12.513
Alfonso was like,
"Now you're teenagers,

37:12.596 --> 37:14.014
and I'm gonna treat you
like a teenager."

37:14.098 --> 37:15.558
And he was the first one
who, like,

37:15.641 --> 37:18.018
- assigned us homework.
- Yeah.

37:18.102 --> 37:19.395
Loosen up, loosen up.

37:19.478 --> 37:21.313
<i>He wanted to get to know us,</i>

37:21.397 --> 37:24.358
so he set us this exercise
where he asked us

37:24.441 --> 37:26.235
to write an essay in character.

37:28.946 --> 37:31.198
<i>He was like,
"You know these characters</i>

37:31.282 --> 37:33.534
<i>"at this point better
than I'm ever gonna be able</i>

37:33.617 --> 37:36.495
<i>to understand who they are,
so you tell me."</i>

37:36.579 --> 37:38.122
<i>And after about, sort of,</i>

37:38.205 --> 37:40.082
<i>a half a side of A4,
I was like,</i>

37:40.166 --> 37:42.168
"I feel like I've pretty much
covered everything.

37:42.251 --> 37:45.462
<i>"Like, Jo has written
a good 500 pages about this,</i>

37:45.546 --> 37:48.048
"but I feel like this one
pretty much sums it up.

37:48.132 --> 37:50.384
Great, okay. Yeah, cool.
Proud of that. Bring that in."

37:50.468 --> 37:54.555
Of course, Emma writes,
like, 12 pages,

37:54.638 --> 37:56.015
like, beautifully written.

37:56.098 --> 38:00.186
Rupert didn't deliver
anything.

38:00.269 --> 38:01.729
I didn't do it.

38:01.812 --> 38:03.564
And I said, "Rupert,
where's your assignment?"

38:03.647 --> 38:09.111
He says, "Well, uh, I thought
that Ron wouldn't do it..."

38:09.195 --> 38:11.989
"So I didn't do it."

38:12.072 --> 38:14.241
I mean, luckily,
Alfonso kind of saw

38:14.325 --> 38:16.118
that it was very in character
for... for...

38:16.202 --> 38:17.536
for me not to have done it.

38:17.620 --> 38:21.081
Rupert is Ron.

38:21.165 --> 38:23.876
<i>It's just Ron 100%.</i>

38:23.959 --> 38:28.422
Emma is just such
an effortless actor.

38:28.506 --> 38:30.299
<i>She prepares a lot.</i>

38:30.382 --> 38:32.760
When you're doing the scenes,
it's as if everything

38:32.843 --> 38:34.428
is just flowing out of her.

38:34.511 --> 38:37.556
<i>The truth of the matter
is that they are great actors.</i>

38:37.640 --> 38:41.685
<i>Sirius Black
finds a redemption</i>

38:41.769 --> 38:46.190
<i>by having Harry understanding
who he truly is.</i>

38:46.273 --> 38:48.192
<i>It's a moment of...
of great liberation,</i>

38:48.275 --> 38:49.944
<i>of great freedom,</i>

38:50.027 --> 38:54.031
and all of this is conveyed
symbolically in the two of them

38:54.114 --> 38:57.743
flying in the night
under the silver moon.

39:02.623 --> 39:04.458
<i>It was like a family,
wasn't it?</i>

39:04.541 --> 39:05.668
Yeah.

39:05.751 --> 39:08.045
More than any
other experience.

39:08.128 --> 39:09.797
You never have that
in the movies

39:09.880 --> 39:11.632
because you work
with a bunch of people

39:11.715 --> 39:13.217
and you get friendly with them

39:13.300 --> 39:15.928
and then most of them
you would never see again.

39:16.011 --> 39:19.223
But with "Potter," you would
come... you would come back

39:19.306 --> 39:23.852
and that's what made it,
amongst many things,

39:23.936 --> 39:26.021
- what made it very special.
- Yeah.

39:26.105 --> 39:28.357
It just feels like,
you know, being in these,

39:28.440 --> 39:30.818
you get to be a part
of film history.

39:39.576 --> 39:41.495
Hogwarts has been chosen

39:41.578 --> 39:44.999
to host
the Triwizard Tournament.

39:47.626 --> 39:49.128
"The Goblet of Fire"

39:49.211 --> 39:52.172
during all of
the Triwizard Tournament stuff,

39:52.256 --> 39:57.094
<i>it was so lovely to be
surprised and blown away</i>

39:57.177 --> 40:02.850
and, like, taken away
by the magic of the scenes

40:02.933 --> 40:04.184
and to be surprised.

40:04.268 --> 40:05.519
<i>Like, I remember seeing
the Beauxbatons</i>

40:05.602 --> 40:07.396
<i>come and do their entrance</i>

40:07.479 --> 40:09.690
<i>and the Durmstrangs.</i>

40:09.773 --> 40:11.525
It was really cool.

40:13.277 --> 40:15.696
<i>With the fourth film,
we wanted a British director.</i>

40:15.779 --> 40:17.406
We wanted something
quite theatrical.

40:17.489 --> 40:18.824
Cut, thank you very much.

40:18.907 --> 40:22.911
Mike is just this excited,

40:22.995 --> 40:25.914
loud, passionate man.

40:27.583 --> 40:29.418
<i>He was a perfect director
for that film.</i>

40:29.501 --> 40:32.004
It was a really, like,
bombastic,

40:32.087 --> 40:36.008
<i>action-packed, wonderful,
eccentric film.</i>

40:36.091 --> 40:37.676
I love Mike. He was great.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.720
<i>I mean, he was almost like
he was from the books.</i>

40:39.803 --> 40:42.556
He was like
a Hogwarts character.

40:42.639 --> 40:44.850
The fourth book
is the biggest of them.

40:44.933 --> 40:47.561
It's about 900 pages.
It's a doorstop.

40:47.644 --> 40:49.188
It's a house brick.

40:49.271 --> 40:50.647
Action!

40:50.731 --> 40:53.651
<i>And I thought,
if it's really gonna nail</i>

40:53.734 --> 40:55.569
the little darlings
to their seats,

40:55.652 --> 41:01.408
then it has to have this great,
big, energetic core to it.

41:01.492 --> 41:04.745
<i>He was just this kind of,
like, firecracker of energy.</i>

41:04.828 --> 41:06.413
<i>He'd get so excited by things.</i>

41:06.497 --> 41:08.749
<i>And there was this kind of
really endearing,</i>

41:08.832 --> 41:10.584
like, childlike quality
to... to him.

41:10.667 --> 41:13.420
<i>He loved the humor as well
and would always</i>

41:13.504 --> 41:15.339
<i>try and find it
in every scene.</i>

41:15.422 --> 41:18.175
It was probably only
a couple of films in

41:18.258 --> 41:20.260
that I sort of started
to feel nervous.

41:20.344 --> 41:22.096
- And I remember...
- It was Mike's change

41:22.179 --> 41:23.430
when... when Columbus left.

41:23.514 --> 41:24.848
It was definitely
a bit of a different...

41:24.932 --> 41:26.392
Yeah,
it was a different vibe.

41:26.475 --> 41:28.435
- Mike Newell.
- Mike treated us like adults.

41:28.519 --> 41:29.686
- That was it.
- Yeah.

41:29.770 --> 41:31.605
- He did, I suppose.
- Yeah.

41:31.689 --> 41:33.315
We did have fun on set.

41:36.693 --> 41:40.072
<i>The Weasley twins,
whom I-I was very fond of,</i>

41:40.155 --> 41:42.658
<i>they had to fight.</i>

41:42.741 --> 41:44.952
We were doing the scene
when Fred and George

41:45.035 --> 41:47.121
are rejected from entering
the Triwizard Tournament.

41:47.204 --> 41:49.873
<i>And then we had these wigs
on and beards on.</i>

41:49.957 --> 41:51.709
<i>What looked like old men.</i>

41:51.792 --> 41:53.544
<i>And Mike said, "Okay, so I
think you guys will be really</i>

41:53.627 --> 41:54.878
<i>"annoyed with each other.
I think you should have</i>

41:54.962 --> 41:56.422
<i>a good fight about this."</i>

41:56.505 --> 42:00.467
These two were sort of,
um, pressing about at it.

42:00.551 --> 42:02.136
Cut!

42:02.219 --> 42:04.638
<i>And I said, "No, come on boys,
really, it's a fight."</i>

42:04.721 --> 42:05.973
<i>Mike just came over.
He said,</i>

42:06.056 --> 42:07.141
<i>"No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no."</i>

42:07.224 --> 42:08.684
Okay, who wants to fight?

42:08.767 --> 42:11.270
And like an idiot,
I was like, "Oh, yeah, okay."

42:11.353 --> 42:14.523
Well, of course,
I was a tubby 60-year-old gent

42:14.606 --> 42:15.983
at that stage.

42:16.066 --> 42:20.195
Um, and, uh, I-I really
shouldn't have done it.

42:20.279 --> 42:22.865
And so he dived on me
and, like,

42:22.948 --> 42:25.367
just went like this,

42:25.451 --> 42:27.911
to which I said, "Okay."
So I did the same to him.

42:27.995 --> 42:30.873
<i>I-I remember gripping him
'round the waist</i>

42:30.956 --> 42:33.417
<i>and trying to fling him about
and so forth</i>

42:33.500 --> 42:36.003
and cracked a couple of ribs.

42:36.086 --> 42:39.423
And so was in absolute agony
from... from then on.

42:39.506 --> 42:41.925
But of course,
the wonderful thing was

42:42.009 --> 42:44.636
that I had made
a complete twit of myself

42:44.720 --> 42:47.431
and everybody felt
much better for that.

42:47.514 --> 42:51.101
You know when you shouldn't
break a director's rib?

43:02.446 --> 43:03.697
<i>In "The Goblet of Fire,"</i>

43:03.780 --> 43:06.492
that film is just all
about teenagers,

43:06.575 --> 43:08.202
you know, having crushes
for the first time,

43:08.285 --> 43:10.996
asking someone to the date,
to the Yule Ball.

43:11.079 --> 43:13.415
<i>They just mirrored all those
kind of awkward phases</i>

43:13.499 --> 43:14.875
you go through as a teenager,

43:14.958 --> 43:16.543
and they really
felt like that, too,

43:16.627 --> 43:19.046
because we were literally
having the same experiences.

43:19.129 --> 43:21.924
The amount of, um, like,
prep and coaching

43:22.007 --> 43:23.509
Emma and I would give
each other on, like,

43:23.592 --> 43:25.385
texting to the opposite sex...
like, if we...

43:25.469 --> 43:26.929
if she was texting a boy
or I was texting a girl,

43:27.012 --> 43:28.764
I'd be like, "She sent me
this many kisses back.

43:28.847 --> 43:30.557
What do I do?
This is a nightmare."

43:30.641 --> 43:34.228
We had that kind of older
brother, younger sister thing.

43:34.311 --> 43:36.021
<i>It was a very
interesting film</i>

43:36.104 --> 43:38.190
in terms of a lot of hormones
flying around.

43:39.608 --> 43:40.943
<i>There was crushes,</i>

43:41.026 --> 43:42.528
<i>and people
went out with each other</i>

43:42.611 --> 43:44.404
and broke up and...
just like you do in...

43:44.488 --> 43:45.781
like I used to do at school.

43:45.864 --> 43:47.991
Um, it was exactly
the same environment,

43:48.075 --> 43:50.661
<i>but it was just in a Defense
Against the Dark Arts class.</i>

43:53.872 --> 43:57.334
That film was probably
peak hormone, at least for me.

44:01.004 --> 44:02.589
<i>It was exactly
what you'd expect.</i>

44:02.673 --> 44:04.258
And especially, like,
the fourth film was the one

44:04.341 --> 44:07.302
with, like, the Beauxbatons
and the Durmstrangs,

44:07.386 --> 44:09.680
<i>so, like, you had a bunch of,</i>

44:09.763 --> 44:11.431
<i>like, hormonal teenagers
anyway,</i>

44:11.515 --> 44:14.434
and then, like, bring in two
massive groups of new people,

44:14.518 --> 44:17.271
all of them are, like,
purposefully hot for the film.

44:17.354 --> 44:19.898
Um, so it's, yeah,
it was that...

44:19.982 --> 44:21.608
that film was, yeah,
it was all kicking off.

44:21.692 --> 44:24.319
Why do they have to travel
in packs?

44:24.403 --> 44:27.281
<i>He is just, like,
a slightly awkward teenage boy</i>

44:27.364 --> 44:29.491
<i>in a very unremarkable way,</i>

44:29.575 --> 44:30.951
which I suppose feels
sort of remarkable

44:31.034 --> 44:32.703
for a hero character
in something.

44:32.786 --> 44:34.288
You slay dragons.

44:34.371 --> 44:35.956
If you can't get a date,
who can?

44:36.039 --> 44:37.583
I think I'd take the dragon
right now.

44:37.666 --> 44:41.253
Jo wrote him very endearingly
in those years,

44:41.336 --> 44:46.383
and I feel like it did not
take a huge acting stretch

44:46.466 --> 44:51.471
for me to tap into my awkward,
nerdy, teenage side.

44:51.555 --> 44:53.974
- Cho.
- Yes?

44:54.057 --> 44:57.185
Um, I just wondered if you...
I just wondered

44:57.269 --> 44:59.479
if maybe you wanted
to go to the ball with me?

44:59.563 --> 45:02.107
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

45:02.190 --> 45:04.318
It obviously was
a coming-of-age story.

45:08.447 --> 45:10.032
One of the... the big,
big sequences

45:10.115 --> 45:11.908
was the Christmas ball.

45:11.992 --> 45:18.665
The Yule Ball is,
first and foremost, a dance.

45:18.749 --> 45:22.628
<i>The scene when the students
are learning to dance,</i>

45:22.711 --> 45:24.004
it was pretty much like
a typical

45:24.087 --> 45:25.505
school dance of that age.

45:25.589 --> 45:27.966
You've got girls on one side,
boys on the other.

45:28.050 --> 45:30.677
<i>We were in a big room
in Oxford.</i>

45:30.761 --> 45:32.638
Maggie's right in the middle,
and she says,

45:32.721 --> 45:34.514
<i>"Right, I'm gonna
teach you to dance."</i>

45:34.598 --> 45:38.685
<i>Of course, she picks Rupert,
and she says,</i>

45:38.769 --> 45:40.520
Place your right hand

45:40.604 --> 45:42.522
- on my waist.
- What?

45:42.606 --> 45:46.109
The kid's 14, and he knows
how to get a laugh.

45:46.193 --> 45:48.111
It's great.

45:48.195 --> 45:49.696
<i>And weirdly, I felt quite</i>

45:49.780 --> 45:51.198
<i>self-conscious of...
I didn't really know...</i>

45:51.281 --> 45:54.368
من قبلا هیچ وقت با
یه خانوم نرقصیده بودم

45:54.451 --> 45:56.119
.پس یه جورایی یه چیز جدید بود

45:56.203 --> 45:58.872
هیچ وقت قرار نیست بذاری اینو فراموش کنه، مگه نه؟

45:58.955 --> 46:00.374
.هیچ وقت

46:00.457 --> 46:02.668
و آره، جیمز، اولیور ، دوقلوها

46:02.751 --> 46:05.337
.هی منو سیخونک میکردن

46:05.420 --> 46:06.922
...<i>ما هیچ وقت اذییتش نکردیم</i>

46:07.005 --> 46:08.173
.به هر صورت داشیم سرش کرم میریختیم

46:08.256 --> 46:09.216
.قبل اینکه فیلمبرداری رو شروع کنیم

46:09.299 --> 46:10.884
اونا یه جورایی قبل فیلم برداری

46:10.968 --> 46:12.469
،منو قانعم کردن

46:12.552 --> 46:15.222
.که این برنامه رقص برنامه ریزی شده بود

46:15.305 --> 46:17.391
ما بهش گفتیم
قدم هات رو میدونی؟"

46:17.474 --> 46:19.476
میدونی دیگه درسته؟
نه، روالش رو میدونی

46:19.559 --> 46:21.103
ما همه مون شیش هفته گذشته

46:21.186 --> 46:22.562
"یه روتین رو انجام میدادیم
.یا یه چیزی تو این مایه ها

46:22.646 --> 46:25.524
.فقط میخواستن فشار رو روم زیاد کنن

46:25.607 --> 46:27.609
.و این طوری

46:27.693 --> 46:30.112
.حالا، درنهایت مجبور میشی رهبری کنی

46:30.195 --> 46:31.279
فهمیدی؟

46:31.363 --> 46:32.698
!کات

46:33.740 --> 46:38.203
<i>یکی از جذاب ترین روزا
توپ بزرگ بود</i>

46:38.286 --> 46:40.580
چون تموم آدمای جوون

46:40.664 --> 46:42.916
.خیلی خوشگل درست و حسابی لباس پوشیده بودن

46:44.584 --> 46:46.336
.لعنتی

46:50.257 --> 46:53.301
اونا چی‌ان؟
اونا چی‌ان؟

46:53.385 --> 46:54.636
.ردای لباسم‌ـن

46:54.720 --> 46:56.346
<i>لباس هایی که پوشیده بودیم</i>

46:56.430 --> 46:57.931
<i>خیلی... خیلی پهن بودن</i>

46:58.014 --> 47:00.475
و دنباله های خیلی بلندی داشتن

47:00.559 --> 47:02.978
...و تو
و تو ...واقعا

47:03.061 --> 47:05.147
.حس باحال بودن نمیکردی

47:05.230 --> 47:07.357
.من شبیه عمه بزرگم تسی شدم

47:09.860 --> 47:12.112
.بوی شبیه عمه بزرگم تسی هم میدم

47:12.195 --> 47:15.282
تنها چیزی که یادم میاد اینکه

47:15.365 --> 47:17.826
<i>یه چیز شیش یقه پوشیده بودی</i>

47:17.909 --> 47:19.286
<i>اوه، گل و منگول داره، اره</i>

47:19.369 --> 47:20.829
.ولی، یه جورایی ازش خوشم اومد

47:20.912 --> 47:22.831
...یه جورایی
.خیلی ویزلی بود

47:22.914 --> 47:25.125
.اره، عالی بود -
. حس کردم از پسش بر اومدم -

47:25.208 --> 47:26.793
.هرکسی از پس اون بر نمیاد

47:26.877 --> 47:28.503
اِما مشخصا خیلی زیبا بنظر میرسید

47:28.587 --> 47:30.630
. و یه لباس خیلی محشری هم پوشیده بود

47:30.714 --> 47:32.549
و من و روپرت شبیه

47:32.632 --> 47:35.051
شبیه رفقای آسیتن پاور شده بودیم

47:35.135 --> 47:37.262
or something hanging out
at the side.

47:37.345 --> 47:40.474
اون خیلی خوشگله

47:40.557 --> 47:43.977
<i>برای اولین بار
...هری و ران</i>

47:44.060 --> 47:46.354
...<i>بخصوص ران</i>

47:46.438 --> 47:51.568
هرمیون رو به عنوان یه زن جوون دیدن

47:51.651 --> 47:55.989
<i>و نه فقط یه کمک دستی که داشتن</i>

47:56.072 --> 47:59.409
این هرمیون گرنجر؟
با ویکتور کرامه؟

47:59.493 --> 48:02.329
.نه، معلومه که نه

48:03.830 --> 48:05.832
.منظورم اینکه همه میتونن با این ارتباط برقرار کنن

48:05.916 --> 48:07.501
.این چیزیه که من یه جورایی درمورد این داستانا دوست دارم

48:07.584 --> 48:10.420
<i>اینکه خیلی شبیه زندگی همه‌ست</i>

48:10.504 --> 48:14.883
مثل اولین رقص مدسه
و احساساتی مثل

48:14.966 --> 48:18.178
<i>اظطراب و عدم اعتماد به نفس  </i>

48:18.261 --> 48:21.515
میدونستم که چیز خیلی بزرگیه
و تو عذاب بودم

48:21.598 --> 48:23.141
...من... من

48:23.225 --> 48:25.727
<i>میدونستم که این شبیه</i>

48:25.811 --> 48:27.813
.<i>تبدیل شدن جوجه اردک به قوئه</i>

48:27.896 --> 48:30.690
.<i>ویهو یه فشار خیلی زیادی رومون اومد</i>

48:30.774 --> 48:33.527
دستت رو نتابون، باشه؟

48:33.610 --> 48:34.861
مایک نویل به منو راهنماییم کرد

48:34.945 --> 48:37.322
.تا با لباس از پله ها بیام پایین

48:37.405 --> 48:38.949
دستات خیلی میتابن"

48:39.032 --> 48:41.368
.خیلی سریع راه میری
".باید آروم تر راه بری

48:41.451 --> 48:43.495
<i>Like, he's giving me
a million different directions</i>

48:43.578 --> 48:44.955
<i>about how to walk
down the stairs.</i>

48:45.038 --> 48:47.249
And of course,
I fell down the stairs.

48:47.332 --> 48:50.502
<i>We were a bunch of very
self-conscious teenagers.</i>

48:50.585 --> 48:52.254
<i>They were, like, uh,</i>

48:52.337 --> 48:54.214
"You're gonna learn
some dance steps for this."

48:54.297 --> 48:55.924
You trust me, don't you?

48:56.007 --> 48:58.343
<i>I'm not a dancer, and I
will never be able to dance.</i>

48:58.426 --> 49:00.929
Yeah, I feel like
I'm pretty rigid

49:01.012 --> 49:02.389
in... in that dance scene.

49:05.183 --> 49:08.395
Oh, look at that.
Look at that. Stunned.

49:08.478 --> 49:10.397
Lucky man. Lucky man.

49:10.480 --> 49:13.692
Emma and I have always
loved each other, really.

49:13.775 --> 49:16.570
I walked into the room
where we were having tutoring.

49:16.653 --> 49:18.196
<i>The assignment
that had been given</i>

49:18.280 --> 49:21.616
<i>was to draw what you
thought God looked like.</i>

49:21.700 --> 49:26.663
And Tom had drawn a girl with
a backward cap on a skateboard.

49:26.746 --> 49:29.207
<i>And I just don't know
how to say it...</i>

49:29.291 --> 49:31.126
<i>I just fell in love with him.</i>

49:31.209 --> 49:33.920
I think I was in the hair
and makeup chair.

49:34.004 --> 49:36.256
And someone said something
along the lines of,

49:36.339 --> 49:37.465
"Yeah, she had a crush on you."

49:37.549 --> 49:39.009
I used to come in every day

49:39.092 --> 49:40.760
and look for his number
on the call sheet.

49:40.844 --> 49:42.304
It was number seven.

49:42.387 --> 49:44.472
And if it... if... if his number
was on the call sheet,

49:44.556 --> 49:47.100
it was an extra exciting day.

49:47.183 --> 49:49.269
He was three years above me.

49:49.352 --> 49:53.189
And so for him, he was like,
"You're like my little sister."

49:53.273 --> 49:55.358
<i>I was... became very
protective over her.</i>

49:55.442 --> 49:58.028
Yeah, I've always had
a soft spot for... for her,

49:58.111 --> 50:01.072
um, and that continues
to the day.

50:01.156 --> 50:03.950
I think really the truth
of it was Tom

50:04.034 --> 50:09.039
was the one that I could often
be more vulnerable with.

50:09.122 --> 50:10.707
There's always been something
that's like,

50:10.790 --> 50:12.208
I don't know, a kinship.

50:12.292 --> 50:14.628
Nothing has ever, ever, ever,
ever happened

50:14.711 --> 50:16.171
<i>romantically with us.</i>

50:16.254 --> 50:18.632
We just love each other.

50:18.715 --> 50:20.467
That's all I can say
about that.

50:25.889 --> 50:27.807
Together! One...

50:27.891 --> 50:29.392
Two, three.

50:35.941 --> 50:40.153
In "The Goblet of Fire,"
the universe shifts,

50:40.236 --> 50:43.823
and suddenly,
there is Voldemort.

50:50.622 --> 50:53.083
<i>I cast Ralph Fiennes because</i>

50:53.166 --> 50:56.628
<i>he's one of the most potent
actors of his generation.</i>

50:56.711 --> 50:59.589
And I knew
that he had a great force,

50:59.673 --> 51:04.344
<i>just kind of delicate,
subtle force of personality.</i>

51:04.427 --> 51:07.639
<i>My sister has children
who were then</i>

51:07.722 --> 51:09.516
<i>around 10, 11, 12.</i>

51:09.599 --> 51:12.102
I said, "Martha, I don't know
about this Harry Potter thing.

51:12.185 --> 51:14.145
Voldemort. What's that?"

51:14.229 --> 51:15.438
"What?

51:15.522 --> 51:17.649
"You're being asked
to play Voldemort?

51:17.732 --> 51:19.693
You've got to do it!"

51:25.240 --> 51:27.450
<i>And then I was shown
some drawings...</i>

51:27.534 --> 51:28.910
design ideas for the look.

51:28.994 --> 51:31.037
<i>I wasn't expecting that.</i>

51:31.121 --> 51:34.165
<i>And I thought,
"Wow, that's a strong look."</i>

51:34.249 --> 51:36.543
I didn't feel Voldemort
was that human.

51:36.626 --> 51:38.795
I felt he was
the essence of evil.

51:38.878 --> 51:40.213
<i>I know he's been human,</i>

51:40.296 --> 51:42.924
<i>but he's become
a snakelike thing.</i>

51:43.008 --> 51:44.259
So there was the voice.

51:44.342 --> 51:46.928
The sort of snakelike
whispered, husky,

51:47.012 --> 51:51.349
something that I suppose I've...
sort of whispering voice.

51:51.433 --> 51:54.310
Breath on the breath.

51:54.394 --> 51:57.147
"Ah, Harry Potter..."

51:57.230 --> 51:59.357
Come to die.

51:59.441 --> 52:02.652
Ralph wanted to be
ultimately evil

52:02.736 --> 52:03.820
and otherworldly.

52:03.903 --> 52:06.156
<i>And the best way to do that</i>

52:06.239 --> 52:08.575
<i>was to take his nose off.</i>

52:08.658 --> 52:10.910
He does have a nose...
spoiler alert...

52:10.994 --> 52:12.787
<i>and he was covered
in stickers.</i>

52:12.871 --> 52:16.875
So he was slightly less
intimidating than on-screen,

52:16.958 --> 52:18.668
except when they called action.

52:18.752 --> 52:20.754
And for some reason,
I was terrified of him.

52:20.837 --> 52:24.507
I can touch you.

52:24.591 --> 52:26.426
<i>It took about three hours
in makeup,</i>

52:26.509 --> 52:28.636
<i>the painting of the hands,
the nails, the teeth,</i>

52:28.720 --> 52:31.264
and even with my nose,

52:31.347 --> 52:35.894
um, I... I felt...

52:37.771 --> 52:41.274
<i>Strong. It felt powerful.
It felt evil.</i>

52:41.357 --> 52:46.863
What was big was that one
of the people that you assume

52:46.946 --> 52:51.409
is gonna be very important
to the story is Cedric Diggory.

52:51.493 --> 52:56.247
<i>In that confrontation,
Cedric is killed.</i>

52:56.331 --> 52:58.291
Kill the spare.

52:58.374 --> 53:00.835
- <i>Avada Kedavra!</i>
- Cedric!

53:02.462 --> 53:07.759
<i>And Harry,
he manages to take the body</i>

53:07.842 --> 53:12.180
and crash land back at the end
of the competition,

53:12.263 --> 53:16.392
<i>and Cedric Diggory's father
believes that his son has won</i>

53:16.476 --> 53:19.354
and then he realizes
that the kid is dead,

53:19.437 --> 53:21.689
and he howls like a dog.

53:21.773 --> 53:23.149
That's my boy!

53:25.902 --> 53:28.822
That's my boy!

53:28.905 --> 53:31.866
<i>Suddenly, something
completely unexpected</i>

53:31.950 --> 53:34.452
<i>and serious happens,</i>

53:34.536 --> 53:38.164
and suddenly you realize that
this movie is not about life.

53:38.248 --> 53:39.374
It's about death.

53:39.457 --> 53:40.834
<i>It's such a massive scene</i>

53:40.917 --> 53:42.418
<i>'cause it is also
the first time</i>

53:42.502 --> 53:45.421
<i>Harry sort of feels
that kind of death</i>

53:45.505 --> 53:47.549
of... of somebody young,
close to him.

53:48.633 --> 53:50.844
<i>That's a scene I remember
really distinctly going,</i>

53:50.927 --> 53:52.679
<i>"Oh, this is...
yes, these are kids' films,</i>

53:52.762 --> 53:54.514
<i>but my God, there's some
challenging stuff in there."</i>

53:54.597 --> 53:59.018
He's back, he's back.
Voldemort's back.

53:59.102 --> 54:01.271
<i>The moment of
Cedric Diggory's death</i>

54:01.354 --> 54:05.817
<i>is the moment
when the series comes of age,</i>

54:05.900 --> 54:10.071
and now the children
have left childhood

54:10.155 --> 54:12.282
<i>and are going to have
to confront</i>

54:12.365 --> 54:14.617
<i>the perils of adulthood.</i>

54:14.701 --> 54:17.871
<i>And it all comes
from that moment of death.</i>

54:17.954 --> 54:20.707
Cedric Diggory was murdered

54:20.790 --> 54:22.542
by Lord Voldemort.

54:24.335 --> 54:27.005
<i>The three of them,
they're in adversity,</i>

54:27.088 --> 54:30.550
and that forges friendships,
as we know.

54:38.266 --> 54:40.685
<i>"You are protected,
in short,</i>

54:40.768 --> 54:43.188
<i>by your ability to love,"</i>

54:43.271 --> 54:45.690
<i>said Dumbledore loudly.</i>

54:45.773 --> 54:48.526
<i>"The only protection
that can possibly work</i>

54:48.610 --> 54:52.238
<i>"against the lure of power
like Voldemort's.</i>

54:52.322 --> 54:54.532
<i>"In spite
of all the temptation</i>

54:54.616 --> 54:58.036
<i>"you have endured,
all the suffering,</i>

54:58.119 --> 55:01.372
<i>you remain pure of heart."</i>

55:15.345 --> 55:17.764
How nice of you to let us
do this in your house.

55:17.847 --> 55:19.891
I know, so nice.

55:19.974 --> 55:21.392
You know what
I've always wanted to do?

55:21.476 --> 55:24.520
Let me see if we can...
is get up here.

55:25.980 --> 55:28.358
Oh, now, look, they really
don't look very well.

55:29.984 --> 55:32.278
- They're all still here.
- They're really still here.

55:32.362 --> 55:35.782
I mean, has anyone fed them?
This is so sad.

55:35.865 --> 55:37.533
Okay, now you can be
Harry Potter.

55:37.617 --> 55:38.826
Okay, actually.

55:40.745 --> 55:42.622
I'll go down the right,
you go down the left.

55:42.705 --> 55:45.375
Yeah, and let's race, okay?
On your mark, set, go.

55:45.458 --> 55:46.751
Oh, God.

55:47.877 --> 55:49.420
We're snogging down here.

55:50.713 --> 55:52.382
- Get over it.
- You know what?

55:52.465 --> 55:54.634
I-I took a photograph
of something.

55:54.717 --> 55:57.971
Last night, I thought, I'm just
gonna dig up these things,

55:58.054 --> 56:00.056
and I asked for your autograph.

56:00.139 --> 56:01.307
God. Is that right?

56:01.391 --> 56:02.558
No. Read it out.

56:02.642 --> 56:06.104
It's so nice to see you.
What does it say?

56:06.187 --> 56:07.689
- "Dear HBC..."
- Yeah.

56:07.772 --> 56:11.734
"It was a pleasure being
your costar and coaster."

56:11.818 --> 56:12.819
Wow.

56:12.902 --> 56:13.945
What a... what a clever pun.

56:14.028 --> 56:15.446
That was clever.

56:15.530 --> 56:16.823
I mean, I'm honestly still
kinda pleased with that.

56:16.906 --> 56:18.324
You were poetic.
Yeah, yeah.

56:18.408 --> 56:19.784
"In the sense
that I always ended up

56:19.867 --> 56:21.869
holding your coffee.
I do love you."

56:21.953 --> 56:23.579
And what does it say?

56:26.916 --> 56:28.459
- You can share.
- I can.

56:28.543 --> 56:30.253
We can share this now.
I said, "I do love you.

56:30.336 --> 56:32.005
"And I just wish I'd been born
10 years earlier.

56:32.088 --> 56:33.506
I might've been in
with a chance."

56:33.589 --> 56:34.966
It's all right now.

56:35.049 --> 56:36.342
"Lots of love
and thanks for being cool."

56:36.426 --> 56:37.552
Isn't it nice?

56:37.635 --> 56:39.012
Now, I shall always
treasure that.

56:39.095 --> 56:41.723
- Thank you.
- That is in my toilet, Dan.

56:48.479 --> 56:49.856
<i>There's a storm coming,
Harry.</i>

56:49.939 --> 56:52.025
We'd all best be ready
when she does.

56:53.735 --> 56:57.780
Yes!

56:57.864 --> 57:00.408
<i>I was in film number five,
"Order of the Phoenix."</i>

57:00.491 --> 57:01.909
- Yeah.
- Look, I got my teeth.

57:01.993 --> 57:03.328
- Helena's brought her teeth.
- My teeth.

57:03.411 --> 57:04.954
She's assured me
that she's done

57:05.038 --> 57:06.914
literally nothing to these
in terms of cleaning.

57:06.998 --> 57:10.752
No, these are actual relic.
There's 11 years in there.

57:10.835 --> 57:13.338
Yeah, it smells a bit whiffy,
but...

57:13.421 --> 57:14.756
You just gonna put them
right in your mouth, yeah?

57:14.839 --> 57:16.007
No, but the teeth
were helpful.

57:16.090 --> 57:17.508
- Yeah.
- Okay, in they go.

57:17.592 --> 57:19.552
- What do you think?
- Yeah, I'd forgotten.

57:19.635 --> 57:20.720
Do... do you remember me?

57:20.803 --> 57:22.305
I remember... this is... yeah.

57:25.892 --> 57:27.852
.ببین این دندونه خیلی کمک کرد -
به شخصیتی که توی فیلم داشتی؟ -

57:27.935 --> 57:29.604
I think I wanted
to be in camouflage.

57:29.687 --> 57:31.773
،وقتی اولین بار بهم پیشنهاد نقشو دادن

57:31.856 --> 57:33.149
جو واسم یه پیغام شخصی و محرمانه فرستاد

57:33.232 --> 57:34.692
،که توش میگفت "ممکنه توی متن ندیده باشیش

57:34.776 --> 57:36.861
اما شخصیتت توی فیلم
."یه کار خارق‌العاده قراره بکنه

57:36.944 --> 57:38.279
،بازی کردن نقش «بلاتریکس» بهم حال داد

57:38.363 --> 57:40.031
چون شخصیتش، درونیات بچه‌گونه

57:40.114 --> 57:42.575
.و پر از شیطنتی داشت
...و من واکنشم این بود که

57:42.658 --> 57:44.077
."چقدر شخصیتش "آنارشیست‌ـه -
.و کاملا روانی بود، آره -

57:44.160 --> 57:45.286
...یه بازیگوشی خاصی داشت

57:45.370 --> 57:46.662
.آره بازیگوش بود

57:46.746 --> 57:48.206
.که همین خیلی اذیت‌کننده‌ترش میکنه

57:48.289 --> 57:49.749
البته «بلاتریکس»، خودش
فکر نمیکنه که شروره

57:49.832 --> 57:51.167
.دقیقا برعکس، فکر میکنه آدم خوبیه -
.عه؟ که اینطور -

57:51.250 --> 57:52.585
پس باید یه جورایی مینشستم و فکرمیکردم

57:52.668 --> 57:54.670
که چرا به مردم صدمه میزنه

57:54.754 --> 57:58.925
و چرا این صدمه زدنا، براش غیراخلاقی نیست
.باید یه دلیل واسش پیدا میکردم

57:59.008 --> 58:01.386
.باعث میشد احساس قدرتمند بودن بکنه

58:01.469 --> 58:03.054
!ها

58:03.137 --> 58:05.890
.پاترِ کوچولو... موچولو

58:05.973 --> 58:08.518
!آرـــــــــه

58:10.728 --> 58:13.022
بلاتریکس یه شخصیت وحشی

58:13.106 --> 58:14.440
.غیرقابل کنترل بود

58:14.524 --> 58:15.817
هیچوقت نمیتونی حدس بزنی

58:15.900 --> 58:17.652
.قراره چی بگه

58:19.362 --> 58:21.197
و همچین شخصیتی واسه بازیگرش
خیلی باحال و هیجان انگیزه

58:21.280 --> 58:23.783
چون کارایی که توی یه برداشت انجام میداد
،رو قرار نبود توی برداشت بعدی

58:23.866 --> 58:25.243
.هم انجام بده

58:25.326 --> 58:27.370
یادمه یه مواقعی میخواستم بیشترین تاثیر
.رو روی صحنه، "من" بزارم

58:27.453 --> 58:28.955
.بعد اون میومد واسه خودش حال میکرد

58:30.540 --> 58:32.125
.اون اجازه داره هرکاری که میخواد بکنه

58:32.208 --> 58:33.960
،میتونست صداشو جیغ کنه و بخنده
.میتونست بالا پایین بپره اصن

58:34.043 --> 58:35.461
.آروم باشید

58:35.545 --> 58:37.130
.و هرچی که دلش میخواست بگه

58:37.213 --> 58:40.633
And just not knowing... not...
trying to keep her in tow.

58:40.716 --> 58:42.260
!دورگه کثیف

58:42.343 --> 58:44.637
چیزی نیست، اون فقط یه بچه‌کنجکاوه
مگه نه؟

58:44.720 --> 58:46.305
."همش میخواستم برگردم بهش بگم "خفه شو

58:46.389 --> 58:48.349
.دریکو

58:56.816 --> 58:58.609
کشتمت، مگه نه؟ -
...آره کشتیم، اما -

58:58.693 --> 59:00.153
.آره دیگه، ببخشید حالا

59:00.236 --> 59:01.863
...آم -
.باید میکشتمت -

59:01.946 --> 59:03.823
،یادمه با

59:03.906 --> 59:05.366
<i>'cause you were
a really good wizard.</i>

59:05.450 --> 59:07.118
<i>I was really good witch.</i>

59:07.201 --> 59:09.620
<i>And we had a real duel,
and they cut the whole lot.</i>

59:10.746 --> 59:11.664
And that's really messed up,

59:11.747 --> 59:12.999
because I just thought,

59:13.082 --> 59:14.834
"I've been to wand school
for weeks."

59:14.917 --> 59:16.919
And we were
on that set for days.

59:17.003 --> 59:18.379
Days, it was in the run.

59:18.463 --> 59:20.631
I think it was really
one of my first things

59:20.715 --> 59:22.425
and you fell into the veil.
What was it? The veil?

59:22.508 --> 59:23.551
- Yeah, yeah.
- Was it?

59:23.634 --> 59:25.094
I go through the veil.

59:25.178 --> 59:28.681
Then there was speculation
of, does he come back?

59:28.764 --> 59:30.975
Can you come back
from the veil?

59:31.058 --> 59:32.685
- No, you can't.
- No, you can't.

59:32.768 --> 59:35.021
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

59:51.954 --> 59:53.164
I will say that that was

59:53.247 --> 59:54.373
an interesting point
for all of us

59:54.457 --> 59:55.833
as, like, younger actors.

59:55.917 --> 59:58.252
'Cause there was
a certain group, like Maggie...

59:58.336 --> 01:00:00.421
- Yeah
- David Bradley, and Alan.

01:00:00.505 --> 01:00:02.715
They had known us
when we were 10 or 11.

01:00:02.798 --> 01:00:05.176
And when you came in, by that
point, I was like 15, 16.

01:00:05.259 --> 01:00:07.512
So, like, you
and Gary and David, like,

01:00:07.595 --> 01:00:09.889
would treat us more
like adults; I loved it.

01:00:09.972 --> 01:00:11.933
You saw in us, that, like,
a few of us were, like,

01:00:12.016 --> 01:00:13.726
kind of ready to be like,
"Could you push me?

01:00:13.809 --> 01:00:15.895
Like, we... we wanna try
and be actors too."

01:00:23.736 --> 01:00:26.405
<i>By the time we get
to "Order of the Phoenix,"</i>

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:29.075
<i>the world is becoming
more political.</i>

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:31.536
<i>And I felt
we needed a director</i>

01:00:31.619 --> 01:00:34.247
<i>who could handle that
in an entertaining way.</i>

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.791
David Yates works
so well with actors,

01:00:36.874 --> 01:00:39.835
really pushes them
in all the right way.

01:00:39.919 --> 01:00:43.256
Progress for the sake
of progress

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:45.883
must be discouraged.

01:00:45.967 --> 01:00:49.303
David was just such
a sweet, kind of gentle guy

01:00:49.387 --> 01:00:52.682
<i>that really cared so much
about all of these characters.</i>

01:00:52.765 --> 01:00:54.433
<i>And also, I'd get
a lot of kinda one-on-one</i>

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:55.893
<i>with David Yates.</i>

01:00:55.977 --> 01:00:57.937
<i>I went into
"Order of the Phoenix"</i>

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.939
<i>with the young actors in mind
and sort of thinking about</i>

01:01:00.022 --> 01:01:02.275
<i>how we sort of grow
the whole thing up</i>

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:04.610
<i>and make it
a little bit more adult</i>

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:08.072
and sort of thematic
and a little darker.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.954
<i>It needed to expand
and get bigger</i>

01:01:15.037 --> 01:01:17.331
<i>and more and more frightening.</i>

01:01:19.125 --> 01:01:21.168
Ah!

01:01:21.252 --> 01:01:24.964
<i>There was a big increase
in scale and complexity,</i>

01:01:25.047 --> 01:01:28.593
from being childish
to influencing events

01:01:28.676 --> 01:01:31.596
and being part
of the big world.

01:01:31.679 --> 01:01:33.973
He's just a boy.

01:01:34.056 --> 01:01:35.391
You say much more,
and you might as well

01:01:35.474 --> 01:01:36.892
induct him into the Order
straight away.

01:01:36.976 --> 01:01:38.519
Good. I want to join.

01:01:38.603 --> 01:01:40.605
If Voldemort's raising an army,
then I want to fight.

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:48.029
<i>When I started, one thing
that David and the studio</i>

01:01:48.112 --> 01:01:49.822
spoke to me about was,

01:01:49.905 --> 01:01:54.744
Emma is not sure she wants to
come back to do another Potter.

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:56.954
Oh, Harry.

01:01:59.915 --> 01:02:02.668
People definitely forget
what she took on

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:04.837
and how gracefully she did it.

01:02:05.921 --> 01:02:08.758
<i>Dan and Rupert,
they had each other.</i>

01:02:08.841 --> 01:02:10.843
<i>I had my cronies,</i>

01:02:10.926 --> 01:02:12.678
whereas Emma
was not only younger,

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:16.474
she was... she was by herself.

01:02:16.557 --> 01:02:20.603
I did find a diary entry
that was kind of like, hmm.

01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:25.399
<i>I could see that,
at times, I was lonely.</i>

01:02:25.483 --> 01:02:27.193
We never talked
about it on the film

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:28.903
because we were all just kids.

01:02:29.987 --> 01:02:31.530
<i>As a 14-year-old boy,</i>

01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:33.199
I was never gonna turn around
to another 14-year-old

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:34.533
and be like,
"Hey, how you doing?

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:36.410
Like, is everything okay?"

01:02:36.494 --> 01:02:38.037
<i>So "Order of the Phoenix."</i>

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.206
Was when things started
getting spicy for all of us.

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:42.541
Mm, but you were
considering pulling out.

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:44.210
I never really spoke
to you about this.

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:46.879
Yeah. I think, um...

01:02:46.962 --> 01:02:48.422
- I think I was scared.
- Yeah.

01:02:48.506 --> 01:02:50.049
I don't know if...
if you ever felt like

01:02:50.132 --> 01:02:51.384
it got to a tipping point
when you were like...

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.052
Oh, absolutely.

01:02:53.135 --> 01:02:54.428
This is kinda forever now.

01:02:54.512 --> 01:02:56.430
Yeah.
No, I had moments like that.

01:02:56.514 --> 01:02:57.723
Kind of all the way through.

01:02:59.517 --> 01:03:03.104
<i>I would say I had kind of
similar feelings to Emma.</i>

01:03:03.729 --> 01:03:05.940
Kind of contemplating
what life would be like

01:03:06.023 --> 01:03:08.567
if I called it a day, but...

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:10.861
<i>we never really spoke
about... I guess we were just</i>

01:03:10.945 --> 01:03:12.738
<i>kind of going through it
at our own pace.</i>

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:14.532
We were kind of in the moment.

01:03:14.615 --> 01:03:18.536
At the time, it just didn't
really occur to us

01:03:18.619 --> 01:03:22.289
that we were all kind of having
similar... similar feelings.

01:03:23.916 --> 01:03:26.377
Yeah, um...

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:30.256
the fame thing had
finally hit home in a big way.

01:03:32.133 --> 01:03:35.469
No one had to convince me
to see it through.

01:03:36.929 --> 01:03:39.265
<i>The fans genuinely
wanted us to succeed,</i>

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:42.768
and we all genuinely
had each other's backs.

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.061
How great is that?

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:55.281
<i>It's always amazing
that these films</i>

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:57.283
<i>mean so much to them,
they...'cause we...</i>

01:03:57.366 --> 01:04:00.244
<i>they kind of grew up
alongside us and helped them</i>

01:04:00.327 --> 01:04:02.663
<i>with some really difficult
things in their lives.</i>

01:04:02.747 --> 01:04:06.041
And I'm just very proud
to be a part of something

01:04:06.125 --> 01:04:09.920
that means so much to so many.

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:17.178
I've been thinking about

01:04:17.261 --> 01:04:19.472
something Dumbledore
said to me.

01:04:19.555 --> 01:04:20.806
What's that?

01:04:21.724 --> 01:04:24.727
That even though we've got
a fight ahead of us,

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:27.271
we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

01:04:28.189 --> 01:04:29.315
Yeah?

01:04:31.442 --> 01:04:33.652
Something worth fighting for.

01:04:36.947 --> 01:04:39.825
My son, Billy, we used
to watch them every night.

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.786
You know, if he got
the Sunday night blues,

01:04:41.869 --> 01:04:44.163
he was watching a Potter movie.

01:04:44.246 --> 01:04:45.664
That was his safe place.

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:47.374
I'm really looking forward
to watching the films

01:04:47.458 --> 01:04:49.335
with my hypothetical children
one day.

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:51.879
It's massive, the impact.
It is extraordinary.

01:04:51.962 --> 01:04:53.172
It is unbelievable.

01:04:56.884 --> 01:05:00.137
I was writing to JK Rowling
since I was about 11 years old

01:05:00.221 --> 01:05:01.847
<i>to say thank you to her
to say,</i>

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:04.809
I would find life a bit
hopeless without Harry Potter.

01:05:04.892 --> 01:05:06.977
<i>Luckily for me,
she read the letter</i>

01:05:07.061 --> 01:05:08.521
<i>and responded to it.</i>

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:12.525
So I'm one of the very lucky
few people who can say

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:14.401
JK Rowling was my pen friend.

01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:20.074
<i>The first part
of the audition</i>

01:05:20.157 --> 01:05:21.742
is this crazy open call.

01:05:21.826 --> 01:05:23.869
Literally, anyone can come.

01:05:25.329 --> 01:05:26.872
That's my ticket.
Off we go.

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:27.915
Let's go to London.

01:05:27.998 --> 01:05:29.625
We fly, of course.

01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:33.128
<i>And there would be thousands
of people lining up.</i>

01:05:33.212 --> 01:05:36.090
<i>I remember Dan very vividly.</i>

01:05:36.173 --> 01:05:37.550
<i>It was on my screen test.</i>

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:38.968
Mistletoe.

01:05:40.511 --> 01:05:42.096
I remember him talking to me,

01:05:42.179 --> 01:05:43.806
and I kept forgetting
that I have to talk back to him

01:05:43.889 --> 01:05:46.559
because I'm so used
to watching him on a screen.

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:48.143
So I would just
kind of be like...

01:05:49.103 --> 01:05:51.063
I kind of think
that contributed to the whole

01:05:51.146 --> 01:05:55.860
Luna Lovegood vibe,
because she is a bit spacy.

01:05:55.943 --> 01:05:57.319
Hello, everyone.

01:05:58.571 --> 01:06:00.322
You look dreadful, Ron.

01:06:00.406 --> 01:06:04.201
And then he found
this secret world of odd bots,

01:06:04.285 --> 01:06:07.329
of misfits, of people
who had this strange power

01:06:07.413 --> 01:06:09.915
but who still had
enormous humanity

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:11.750
<i>and depth and vulnerability.</i>

01:06:11.834 --> 01:06:13.794
<i>The movies kind of
gave people permission</i>

01:06:13.878 --> 01:06:15.462
<i>to accept parts of themselves.</i>

01:06:15.546 --> 01:06:18.591
<i>So it was quite liberating
to see your oddness</i>

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:21.760
as a superpower
represented on-screen.

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:23.762
I remember
when I first met you all...

01:06:23.846 --> 01:06:26.932
biggest bunch of misfits
that I ever set eyes on,

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:28.601
and here we all are.

01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:30.144
We're still
a bunch of misfits.

01:06:30.227 --> 01:06:32.980
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:35.691
I was not good at school.

01:06:35.774 --> 01:06:37.484
You'd be better off with
"Goshawk's Guide to Herbology."

01:06:37.568 --> 01:06:39.403
I didn't have
a huge amount of friends.

01:06:40.237 --> 01:06:42.364
Watch where you're going,
Longbottom.

01:06:44.199 --> 01:06:45.743
<i>I think it's great
to be a misfit.</i>

01:06:45.826 --> 01:06:48.120
And I think that's possibly
why it's so popular.

01:06:48.203 --> 01:06:50.789
Everyone wants to know
that they do belong.

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:53.334
<i>It's a great relief
of loneliness, I think.</i>

01:06:53.417 --> 01:06:54.877
<i>I was quite a shy kid.</i>

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.254
<i>I could relate
to that kind of feeling</i>

01:06:57.338 --> 01:07:00.799
of not quite knowing
what your place is.

01:07:00.883 --> 01:07:02.801
<i>Working hard is important,</i>

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:04.470
but there's something
that matters even more.

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.764
- Stupefy!
- Believing in yourself.

01:07:09.183 --> 01:07:12.227
<i>Everyone felt
more like they belonged</i>

01:07:12.311 --> 01:07:15.397
by witnessing these characters
that didn't belong.

01:07:18.651 --> 01:07:20.486
<i>Bonnie was,
kind of, when she arrived,</i>

01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:23.864
she was only 9, maybe.

01:07:23.948 --> 01:07:25.449
Mummy, have you seen
my jumper?

01:07:25.532 --> 01:07:27.785
Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

01:07:27.868 --> 01:07:29.244
Hello.

01:07:29.328 --> 01:07:32.373
I always found Ginny, Harry,
that relationship,

01:07:32.456 --> 01:07:35.250
how that kind of
slowly developed

01:07:35.334 --> 01:07:39.505
and entangling with it
the whole Weasley family

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:42.883
<i>and Harry essentially
becoming a Weasley, himself.</i>

01:07:43.968 --> 01:07:45.511
It was something I never
really kind of expected,

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:47.262
especially kind
of reading the books.

01:07:47.346 --> 01:07:49.014
<i>Bonnie was the youngest one.</i>

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:51.600
So it was just a bit like,
"Oh, what? This is weird."

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:54.061
Close your eyes.

01:07:54.144 --> 01:07:56.271
<i>And you know, there is
this kind of pressure.</i>

01:07:56.355 --> 01:08:00.025
You know, this is the loved
sort of hero of the story.

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:02.194
So everyone on the set
has known you

01:08:02.277 --> 01:08:04.571
for about six or seven years,
and they've watched you grow up

01:08:04.655 --> 01:08:07.116
<i>and they're now gonna
just watch you kiss.</i>

01:08:07.199 --> 01:08:08.409
Cool. Yeah.

01:08:15.708 --> 01:08:18.294
<i>I mean, there's so many
amazing female roles</i>

01:08:18.377 --> 01:08:20.754
that Jo wrote, and I think
that's really important.

01:08:20.837 --> 01:08:26.343
I am so proud of who Bonnie
and Evanna and Katie are

01:08:26.426 --> 01:08:27.845
and who they've become.

01:08:27.928 --> 01:08:31.055
They've all become
these incredible activists.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:34.727
Every single one of those girls
was like a lovely,

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.895
great human being.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:43.902
I tell you,
I've... I've missed your company.

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:45.738
- Did you? Aw, thank you.
- That's for sure.

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:47.406
Did you get anything?
'Cause I stole quite a lot.

01:08:47.488 --> 01:08:48.782
- Did you really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:48.866 --> 01:08:50.451
I didn't.
I should have known that.

01:08:50.533 --> 01:08:52.077
- I should have told you.
- I'm quite reassured by that.

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:55.247
'cause I was definitely
trying to steal my wand.

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:56.707
And I worry that if I had,

01:08:56.790 --> 01:08:58.207
I probably would have
lost it by now somewhere.

01:08:58.292 --> 01:09:00.169
You know they don't work,
Tom.

01:09:00.252 --> 01:09:01.545
Well, I've been assured

01:09:01.627 --> 01:09:04.548
that in time,
with enough practice...

01:09:04.631 --> 01:09:06.508
- Practice it would work.
- Yes.

01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:08.469
But it's quite funny
looking back at it now,

01:09:08.551 --> 01:09:10.763
us doing these
incredibly elaborate moves

01:09:10.845 --> 01:09:12.348
and nothing happening.

01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:14.640
And nothing... except one time
it did happen with me.

01:09:14.725 --> 01:09:17.644
And they said, okay, this time
we are gonna blow up Hogwarts.

01:09:17.728 --> 01:09:19.772
Oh, yeah, you got to do it,
didn't you? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:21.939
And they said,
so we will take your cue.

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:24.318
When you do your spell,
it will blow up.

01:09:26.236 --> 01:09:30.240
And I was actually
really surprised and scared

01:09:30.323 --> 01:09:32.618
by my own reaction,
'cause I thought, "Wow."

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:38.122
<i>It was this horrible thrill
of power.</i>

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:39.625
<i>Right.</i>

01:09:39.707 --> 01:09:41.835
And, like, I've had
that amount... just pointing

01:09:41.919 --> 01:09:43.962
my wand there
and then it blew up.

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:45.798
Yeah, it's a lot
more satisfying than,

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:47.674
you know,
making a feather levitate.

01:09:47.758 --> 01:09:50.469
Yeah.

01:09:51.428 --> 01:09:52.805
<i>So what was Draco doing</i>

01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:54.348
<i>with that
weird-looking cabinet,</i>

01:09:54.431 --> 01:09:56.975
and who were all those people?
Don't you see?

01:09:57.059 --> 01:09:59.394
It was a ceremony,
an initiation.

01:09:59.478 --> 01:10:00.687
Stop it, Harry.

01:10:00.771 --> 01:10:01.980
I know where
you're going with this.

01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:04.358
It happened.
He's one of them.

01:10:04.441 --> 01:10:05.526
One of what?

01:10:06.610 --> 01:10:07.861
Harry is under the impression

01:10:07.945 --> 01:10:10.239
Draco Malfoy is now
a Death Eater.

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:16.036
<i>The child who hasn't
received affection,</i>

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.123
<i>the enabling love
of the parent or the adult</i>

01:10:19.206 --> 01:10:22.334
can develop this anger
and hatred at the world

01:10:22.417 --> 01:10:23.877
<i>and goes to the dark side.</i>

01:10:23.961 --> 01:10:26.088
You dare to talk to me
like that in my own house?

01:10:26.171 --> 01:10:27.381
Lucius.

01:10:27.464 --> 01:10:29.675
So much of what
Draco's journey is,

01:10:29.758 --> 01:10:31.385
is to do with
whether he is or isn't

01:10:31.468 --> 01:10:32.886
trying to please his father.

01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:34.847
<i>In the sixth film,
they make him do</i>

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:37.266
<i>the worst thing ever, or to
attempt the worst thing ever,</i>

01:10:37.349 --> 01:10:40.519
<i>of killing Dumbledore, and
obviously we see him crumble.</i>

01:10:40.602 --> 01:10:44.481
Draco, years ago,
I knew a boy

01:10:44.565 --> 01:10:47.568
who made all the wrong choices.

01:10:48.819 --> 01:10:51.697
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help.

01:10:52.698 --> 01:10:54.700
Don't you understand?

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.451
I have to do this.

01:10:57.536 --> 01:10:59.621
I have to kill you.

01:10:59.705 --> 01:11:01.248
Or he's gonna kill me.

01:11:01.331 --> 01:11:02.833
<i>With Tom, what was great
with "Half-Blood Prince"</i>

01:11:02.916 --> 01:11:05.544
was you suddenly
took this bad guy

01:11:05.627 --> 01:11:07.087
<i>who, in the previous films,</i>

01:11:07.171 --> 01:11:10.048
<i>had always been
somewhat two dimensional.</i>

01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:12.718
And then we were able
to give him the opportunity

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:17.139
to explore a far more complex
and interesting journey.

01:11:17.222 --> 01:11:19.308
<i>And I sat down with him
and I said, "Tom, look,</i>

01:11:19.391 --> 01:11:21.977
this is your opportunity
to really shine."

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:25.230
I remember David Yates saying
if we can get

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:28.692
just 1% of empathy
or sympathy for him,

01:11:28.775 --> 01:11:30.569
<i>then we'll have done our job.</i>

01:11:30.652 --> 01:11:32.029
Do it.

01:11:32.988 --> 01:11:34.531
<i>To my mind,
Draco is the hero.</i>

01:11:34.615 --> 01:11:36.033
<i>Harry's always gonna
do the right thing.</i>

01:11:36.116 --> 01:11:37.534
Harry's always gonna make
the right choice.

01:11:37.618 --> 01:11:39.495
There's never really
any dilemma for him.

01:11:39.578 --> 01:11:42.623
<i>Draco breaks the chains
of this terrible family</i>

01:11:42.706 --> 01:11:45.083
<i>in his responsibility
and what he's expected to do.</i>

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:49.421
And to watch Tom create
that struggle on-screen

01:11:49.504 --> 01:11:51.590
<i>and really manifest
all that nuance,</i>

01:11:51.673 --> 01:11:52.758
all that complication,

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:54.509
all that great
ethical minefield

01:11:54.593 --> 01:11:58.388
that he tiptoes through
was... it was just so impressive.

01:11:58.472 --> 01:11:59.806
No.

01:12:11.693 --> 01:12:13.278
Severus.

01:12:22.162 --> 01:12:23.747
Please.

01:12:24.665 --> 01:12:26.500
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

01:12:37.052 --> 01:12:38.804
It's obviously amazing
to be back,

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:41.807
but it's like it's so...

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:44.810
I guess, like,
shocking that so many people

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:47.562
that we both thought
would be around for much longer

01:12:47.646 --> 01:12:49.648
than they have been,

01:12:49.731 --> 01:12:54.403
like Helen and Alan
and Richard and...

01:12:54.486 --> 01:12:57.322
Yeah, they're like fam...
like family,

01:12:57.406 --> 01:12:59.157
you can grieve in the same way.

01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:02.327
- Yeah.
- Just too soon.

01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:03.954
Yeah.

01:13:13.964 --> 01:13:17.009
<i>Do not pity the dead, Harry.</i>

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:19.511
<i>Pity the living,</i>

01:13:19.594 --> 01:13:23.765
<i>and above all, all those
who live without love.</i>

01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:32.774
It does not do
to dwell on dreams, Harry,

01:13:32.858 --> 01:13:35.110
and forget to live.

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:43.368
Richard Harris was
such a special, warm person.

01:13:44.661 --> 01:13:46.496
<i>He was so twinkly.</i>

01:13:48.665 --> 01:13:50.167
Well, Richard was classic.

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:52.878
Probably one of
the funniest men I've ever met.

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.880
He was this devilish
11-year-old

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:57.966
trapped in
a 70-plus-year-old man's body.

01:13:58.050 --> 01:14:00.302
Will you give us
another twirl, ace?

01:14:02.054 --> 01:14:03.597
He just had
that glint in his eye,

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.016
which made him the perfect
Dumbledore, by the way.

01:14:06.099 --> 01:14:08.143
Hmm, alas.

01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:11.188
Ear wax.

01:14:11.271 --> 01:14:15.984
Richard Griffiths was just
delicious as Mr. Dursley.

01:14:16.068 --> 01:14:19.071
There's no such thing
as magic.

01:14:20.113 --> 01:14:23.408
<i>He embraced his wickedness</i>

01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:25.577
with such verve and passion.

01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:27.954
<i>His passing was the one
that has affected me most</i>

01:14:28.038 --> 01:14:29.581
<i>because he was generous
with knowledge.</i>

01:14:29.664 --> 01:14:31.583
Just, like, wanted to share
everything with you.

01:14:38.256 --> 01:14:42.427
I wondered when I'd be
seeing you, Mr. Potter.

01:14:43.428 --> 01:14:46.264
I feel really lucky
to have some, you know,

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:47.933
some little bit of touch

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:50.227
<i>with the amount of just
amazing people that passed.</i>

01:14:51.603 --> 01:14:54.106
You know, I'll be very,
very old one day saying, like,

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:56.775
"I knew that absolute legend."

01:14:56.858 --> 01:14:58.735
I... I know
I ought not be here.

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:03.573
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

01:15:03.657 --> 01:15:05.367
<i>Helen McCrory played
my wife.</i>

01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:07.327
I said, "I think I just met

01:15:07.411 --> 01:15:09.788
the best actress
I've ever seen in my life."

01:15:10.831 --> 01:15:11.957
Come.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.959
I feel lucky to have worked
with her

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:16.128
and shared just so much,

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:18.922
<i>frankly, adolescent laughter
with her on the set.</i>

01:15:20.882 --> 01:15:22.592
<i>She had taught me a lot.</i>

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.804
See, I can't even say it.

01:15:30.183 --> 01:15:31.685
She had this ability, yeah,

01:15:31.768 --> 01:15:36.523
just to sort of to show
such empathy in her eyes.

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:39.484
<i>And it was a... it was
a real treat to work with her.</i>

01:15:44.739 --> 01:15:46.158
I can teach you

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:50.537
how to bewitch the mind
and ensnare the senses.

01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:53.748
Alan Rickman never talked
to me like I was a child.

01:15:53.832 --> 01:15:57.210
He always took
my thoughts and opinions

01:15:57.294 --> 01:16:01.923
very seriously, which I was
always very touched by.

01:16:02.007 --> 01:16:05.844
Alan was a very dear friend,
and we had that final scene.

01:16:05.927 --> 01:16:07.637
His final scene.

01:16:08.513 --> 01:16:12.017
It answers to you

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.519
and you only.

01:16:15.353 --> 01:16:16.772
Does it?

01:16:16.855 --> 01:16:19.107
<i>I was a little intimidated
by him.</i>

01:16:19.191 --> 01:16:22.444
His precision,
his expert delivery of lines.

01:16:22.527 --> 01:16:24.738
<i>And we were sort of went
toe to toe in a funny way,</i>

01:16:24.821 --> 01:16:26.531
<i>you know, Snape and Voldemort.</i>

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:28.074
<i>Two actors can relish</i>

01:16:28.158 --> 01:16:29.826
<i>metaphorically fencing
with each other.</i>

01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:33.121
Alan was a magician
in that way as an actor.

01:16:38.126 --> 01:16:40.587
<i>The ones that love us
never really leave us.</i>

01:16:41.963 --> 01:16:43.715
And you can always find them.

01:16:46.384 --> 01:16:47.552
In here.

01:17:23.505 --> 01:17:25.006
<i>Remember this.</i>

01:17:26.258 --> 01:17:28.176
You're not alone.

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.807
The Elder Wand.

01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:38.979
<i>The most powerful wand
ever made.</i>

01:17:39.062 --> 01:17:41.439
The Resurrection Stone.

01:17:45.986 --> 01:17:48.947
The Cloak of Invisibility.

01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:52.450
Together they make
the Deathly Hallows.

01:17:52.534 --> 01:17:56.329
Together they make
one Master of Death.

01:17:57.414 --> 01:17:59.416
The boy who lived.

01:18:02.043 --> 01:18:03.169
Harry!

01:18:09.092 --> 01:18:10.427
<i>Come to die.</i>

01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:11.428
No!

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:16.016
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

01:18:28.653 --> 01:18:31.990
<i>The measures they had taken
to protect their families</i>

01:18:32.073 --> 01:18:35.410
<i>made him realize more than
anything else could have done</i>

01:18:35.493 --> 01:18:38.163
<i>that they really were
going to come with him</i>

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:42.167
<i>and that they knew exactly
how dangerous that would be.</i>

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.961
<i>He wanted to tell them
what that meant to him,</i>

01:18:45.045 --> 01:18:49.215
<i>but he simply could not find
words important enough.</i>

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.185
It's both really cool.

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:03.438
It's really... and it's weird,
like, walking around here

01:19:03.521 --> 01:19:06.858
and seeing the sets
that we were, like, kids on,

01:19:06.941 --> 01:19:08.735
who treated everything
with the amount of respect

01:19:08.818 --> 01:19:10.403
kids treat things when you're
just there and having fun.

01:19:10.487 --> 01:19:11.780
- Yeah.
- It's weird.

01:19:11.863 --> 01:19:13.073
I'm having, like,
weird, nostalgic moments.

01:19:13.156 --> 01:19:14.366
Remember my hamster?

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:15.408
Does anybody
remember my hamster?

01:19:15.492 --> 01:19:16.868
- Yes.
- Millie.

01:19:16.951 --> 01:19:18.203
Yeah. I didn't remember
the hamster's name.

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:19.579
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:19.663 --> 01:19:20.872
That's okay.
Rest in peace, Millie.

01:19:20.955 --> 01:19:22.415
I remember you having
a hamster

01:19:22.499 --> 01:19:24.084
and being vaguely jealous
that you had an animal

01:19:24.167 --> 01:19:26.461
- that was on set with you.
- They made a coffin for it.

01:19:26.544 --> 01:19:27.879
- The carpentry department.
- They did, yeah.

01:19:27.962 --> 01:19:30.090
When Millie died,
the set designers built

01:19:30.173 --> 01:19:33.802
Millie her own
custom-made wooden coffin

01:19:33.885 --> 01:19:35.470
that had velvet
on the inside of it.

01:19:35.553 --> 01:19:36.721
- It was beautiful.
- Whoa!

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.890
And... and it had
her name engraved

01:19:38.973 --> 01:19:41.267
because I was, I mean,
I was beside myself.

01:19:41.351 --> 01:19:42.560
Did we do, like, a service?

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:44.229
I feel like we said
a few words.

01:19:44.312 --> 01:19:47.607
I kept wanting to pick up
dead Millie, and, like,

01:19:47.691 --> 01:19:49.776
stroke and touch dead Millie.

01:19:49.859 --> 01:19:51.486
And he was like, "Emma,

01:19:51.569 --> 01:19:54.739
Millie's got to, like,
stay in the coffin now."

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:57.117
I have forgotten
so much of this.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.078
It doesn't feel like
much time has passed.

01:20:00.161 --> 01:20:01.663
I know.

01:20:01.746 --> 01:20:03.039
We all still look better
than we do in the epilogue.

01:20:03.123 --> 01:20:04.749
- Yes.
- I was gonna say.

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:06.167
Which is great. Like,
we've made it in before that.

01:20:08.712 --> 01:20:10.755
- Bag?
- Yeah.

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:12.048
Jumper?

01:20:12.132 --> 01:20:15.385
I was all forehead
and a fat suit.

01:20:15.468 --> 01:20:17.554
- Yeah, I was very, I was...
- I think I kind of...

01:20:17.637 --> 01:20:18.972
Yeah, you went for it.

01:20:19.055 --> 01:20:20.390
You were like,
"Give me the full, give me..."

01:20:20.473 --> 01:20:21.474
I did, yeah.
Give me everything.

01:20:21.558 --> 01:20:22.684
Yeah, you went all in.

01:20:22.767 --> 01:20:25.186
- Yeah.
- I was so proud of you.

01:20:27.188 --> 01:20:29.190
<i>No one else can really quite
understand</i>

01:20:29.274 --> 01:20:31.484
<i>what we experienced;
it's a very unique thing.</i>

01:20:31.568 --> 01:20:34.821
Think David Yates used
to describe us as astronauts

01:20:34.904 --> 01:20:38.825
'cause no one else has really
experienced this in this scale.

01:20:38.908 --> 01:20:41.578
And we'll be kind of
forever bonded by that.

01:20:46.499 --> 01:20:47.917
<i>Some of
the sweetest memories I have</i>

01:20:48.001 --> 01:20:49.544
from the three of us
is just each of us

01:20:49.627 --> 01:20:52.046
knowing we sort of needed
to take care of each other

01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:53.548
in just small ways.

01:20:53.631 --> 01:20:55.467
<i>Just in terms of, like,
it's really cold.</i>

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:58.803
Like we're all gonna...
we're all gonna stand together

01:20:58.887 --> 01:21:00.430
or I'm knackered.

01:21:00.513 --> 01:21:03.391
Are you okay, Dan,
if I, like, fall asleep on you,

01:21:03.475 --> 01:21:07.145
like, in between this take,
'cause I'm so tired or...

01:21:07.228 --> 01:21:09.481
I think we have all
fallen asleep in various

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:10.899
like on... on each other

01:21:10.982 --> 01:21:12.817
in, like, some of
the most grand cathedrals

01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:15.570
and things in the UK.

01:21:15.653 --> 01:21:17.322
<i>The level of trust I had</i>

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:20.492
and that we did build
over those 10 years was like,

01:21:20.575 --> 01:21:22.160
if we were doing a stunt,

01:21:22.243 --> 01:21:24.996
<i>I trusted that
one of you would catch me.</i>

01:21:25.079 --> 01:21:26.790
<i>I feel like that kind of
trust and reliance</i>

01:21:26.873 --> 01:21:28.917
and that takes, you know,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.502
there's very few
work environments

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:32.003
where you get that much time
to build that up.

01:21:32.086 --> 01:21:33.755
And it was like nonverbal.
Like it was,

01:21:33.838 --> 01:21:35.590
it was like the three of us
could communicate

01:21:35.673 --> 01:21:37.884
without even having
to say anything.

01:21:37.967 --> 01:21:39.844
We just knew
what needed to be done.

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:43.264
We were each very strong
for each other.

01:21:44.516 --> 01:21:46.100
Need to change.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.691
How, Hermione?

01:21:53.775 --> 01:21:55.735
Undetectable extension charm.

01:21:57.028 --> 01:21:58.404
You're amazing, you are.

01:21:59.489 --> 01:22:01.449
Always the tone of surprise.

01:22:01.533 --> 01:22:03.993
<i>These films had
a very different feel.</i>

01:22:04.077 --> 01:22:05.578
<i>We were away from Hogwarts.</i>

01:22:05.662 --> 01:22:08.748
A lot of the time
camping out different places.

01:22:08.832 --> 01:22:10.500
<i>The tone was a lot darker.</i>

01:22:10.583 --> 01:22:12.210
<i>It felt like a different film.</i>

01:22:12.293 --> 01:22:14.295
Dumbledore sends you off
to find all these Horcruxes,

01:22:14.379 --> 01:22:16.047
but it doesn't tell you
how to destroy them?

01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:17.757
It's very refreshing,
I think,

01:22:17.841 --> 01:22:21.261
'cause we all got to do
some a lot more serious stuff.

01:22:21.344 --> 01:22:22.929
<i>And it was a real opportunity</i>

01:22:23.012 --> 01:22:24.556
to go deeper with these
characters.

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:26.432
Are you coming,
are you staying?

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:33.398
I saw you two the other night.

01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:36.025
Ron, that's... that's nothing.

01:22:38.111 --> 01:22:39.320
Ron...

01:22:40.071 --> 01:22:42.073
<i>The scene that I thought
was gonna be really awkward</i>

01:22:42.156 --> 01:22:43.908
<i>and I wasn't sure about at all</i>

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:45.910
which was us doing our dance.

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:48.079
- Yeah.
- Like I... now that's one

01:22:48.162 --> 01:22:51.499
of my favorite scenes
from the whole of the series,

01:22:51.583 --> 01:22:54.085
<i>because the level
of familiarity that you and I</i>

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:56.087
<i>had with each other,
at that point, I didn't think</i>

01:22:56.170 --> 01:22:58.131
<i>I could have done a scene
like that with another actor.</i>

01:22:58.214 --> 01:22:59.841
Well, it's also an
interesting scene 'cause like,

01:22:59.924 --> 01:23:01.718
first of all, we were doing
Harry Potter films.

01:23:01.801 --> 01:23:03.636
And then on the last movie,
the director came and was like,

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.763
"Hey, how about you do
slow dancing to Nick Cave

01:23:05.847 --> 01:23:07.265
for five minutes?"

01:23:07.348 --> 01:23:08.600
We're like, "Wait,
what movie are we working on?"

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:10.143
Like, "Great, but okay."

01:23:10.226 --> 01:23:13.563
<i>♪ I once was blind,
but now I see ♪</i>

01:23:13.646 --> 01:23:17.275
<i>♪ Have you left
a seat for me? ♪</i>

01:23:17.358 --> 01:23:21.988
<i>♪ Is that such a stretch
of the imagination? ♪</i>

01:23:22.071 --> 01:23:25.033
<i>♪ Hey, little train,

01:23:25.116 --> 01:23:28.786
<i>♪ The train that goes

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:32.957
<i>♪ We're happy, Ma,
we're having fun ♪</i>

01:23:34.459 --> 01:23:35.668
<i>There's so much said
in the scene.</i>

01:23:35.752 --> 01:23:37.462
<i>It was unspoken. I loved that.</i>

01:23:37.545 --> 01:23:39.797
<i>And also in the same way
that for the characters,</i>

01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:41.507
<i>they got to have
a moment of fun.</i>

01:23:41.591 --> 01:23:43.009
<i>I feel like you and I got
to have a moment of fun.</i>

01:23:43.092 --> 01:23:44.469
- Yeah, certainly.
- Which we also...

01:23:44.552 --> 01:23:45.970
Needed at that point.

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.805
- You know?
- Yes, absolutely.

01:23:47.889 --> 01:23:50.934
Treacherous little bleeder.
Is there no one we can trust?

01:23:51.017 --> 01:23:52.810
<i>There was that, like... that
scene on the last movie</i>

01:23:52.894 --> 01:23:54.646
where it was like us
running through the forest.

01:23:54.729 --> 01:23:56.147
<i>We were racing through
the woods</i>

01:23:56.230 --> 01:23:58.107
trying not to be caught
by the Snatchers.

01:23:58.191 --> 01:23:59.525
And action.

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:03.655
Well, don't hang about.
Snatch him.

01:24:03.738 --> 01:24:05.990
<i>Honestly, I remember
you and I, Emma,</i>

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:07.283
<i>becoming
incredibly competitive...</i>

01:24:07.367 --> 01:24:08.576
<i>Ridiculously competitive.</i>

01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:10.870
About who was
gonna run faster.

01:24:10.954 --> 01:24:12.664
Give me five. That rocked!
Whoo-hoo!

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:14.415
<i>I feel like
Rupert was always, like,</i>

01:24:14.499 --> 01:24:16.000
<i>a little bit, too, like,
"You guys do what you like."</i>

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:18.002
He was just like,
"You do your thing."

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:19.254
- Yeah...
- I be here.

01:24:19.337 --> 01:24:21.339
For me, running is a stunt,

01:24:21.422 --> 01:24:23.007
walking is a stunt.

01:24:25.927 --> 01:24:27.345
Oof.

01:24:29.263 --> 01:24:30.848
I absolutely do not like

01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:32.642
watching very many scenes
of myself in that,

01:24:32.725 --> 01:24:34.435
but I've watched you two
and I think you're brilliant.

01:24:34.519 --> 01:24:36.354
I remember that was a really
sweet thing, though.

01:24:36.437 --> 01:24:38.773
I do actually remember that the
three of us telling each other

01:24:38.856 --> 01:24:40.984
that we were doing a good job
or that we'd done a scene well.

01:24:41.067 --> 01:24:43.069
Especially 'cause we had
started off young

01:24:43.152 --> 01:24:44.570
and really not knowing
what we were doing.

01:24:44.654 --> 01:24:46.197
So that when we'd see
each other do

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:47.991
like a bit of real acting,
you'd go, "Oh, cool."

01:24:48.074 --> 01:24:49.701
- "That was... that's was cool."
- Yeah, "Well done."

01:24:49.784 --> 01:24:51.160
Like, yeah that was... I guess
we're all getting better.

01:24:51.244 --> 01:24:52.328
- Crushed it.
- Great. Well done.

01:24:52.412 --> 01:24:53.913
- Yeah, yeah.
- I mean.

01:24:53.997 --> 01:24:58.584
Obviously, us kissing
was the most horrifying thing

01:24:58.668 --> 01:25:00.003
- either of us...
- Oh.

01:25:00.086 --> 01:25:02.296
- Yeah.
- Have ever had to go through.

01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:08.594
I'm Hermione Granger.

01:25:08.678 --> 01:25:11.222
And you are?

01:25:11.305 --> 01:25:14.100
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

01:25:14.183 --> 01:25:18.521
"It's levi-ohh-sa,"
not levio-sahh."

01:25:18.604 --> 01:25:20.773
She's a nightmare, honestly.

01:25:20.857 --> 01:25:22.900
No wonder she hasn't got
any friends.

01:25:24.694 --> 01:25:26.237
I think she heard you.

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.448
It was just built up so much
for the whole series.

01:25:28.531 --> 01:25:29.699
Eight films.

01:25:29.782 --> 01:25:31.409
I love Ron
and Hermione's romance

01:25:31.492 --> 01:25:34.078
<i>and the way
that sort of just bubbles away</i>

01:25:34.162 --> 01:25:35.997
<i>under the story constantly.</i>

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.707
Uh... um...

01:25:42.545 --> 01:25:46.340
<i>This relationship has been
so restrained for so long.</i>

01:25:46.424 --> 01:25:48.259
Got a bit of toothpaste.

01:25:50.094 --> 01:25:52.764
Slughorn's having
Christmas, too, you know.

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:54.182
And we're meant
to bring someone.

01:25:54.265 --> 01:25:56.100
I expect you'll be
bringing McLaggen?

01:25:56.184 --> 01:25:59.562
<i>The audience are desperate
to see these two kiss.</i>

01:25:59.645 --> 01:26:01.272
Actually,
I was going to ask you.

01:26:01.355 --> 01:26:02.940
Really?

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:04.859
<i>There's a scene that we
should... it's nice and sweet</i>

01:26:04.942 --> 01:26:06.361
<i>that we should talk about
once you've read it.</i>

01:26:06.444 --> 01:26:07.653
'Cause we'll be doing the kiss
this week

01:26:07.737 --> 01:26:09.197
- between Ron and Hermione.
- What?

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.656
Doing the kiss between
Ron and Hermione in...

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:11.949
- This week?
- This week?

01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:13.951
In the chambers of secrets.

01:26:14.035 --> 01:26:16.746
<i>In this moment
of extraordinary jeopardy,</i>

01:26:16.829 --> 01:26:20.166
<i>they turn to each other
and then they just kiss.</i>

01:26:23.002 --> 01:26:25.922
<i>We've waited
seven movies for this.</i>

01:26:26.005 --> 01:26:28.257
I spoke to both of them
in their trailers,

01:26:28.341 --> 01:26:30.468
<i>made sure
they were both comfortable.</i>

01:26:30.551 --> 01:26:34.347
<i>It was almost like prepping
them for a major sports event.</i>

01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:36.557
<i>You know, saying,
"Okay guys, you can do this.</i>

01:26:36.641 --> 01:26:38.309
<i>It's gonna be great."</i>

01:26:38.392 --> 01:26:40.978
It was meant to be, like,
this, like, dramatic make out.

01:26:41.062 --> 01:26:42.480
'Cause you and I
just kept corpsing...

01:26:42.563 --> 01:26:43.940
- like, we just kept laughing.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:26:44.023 --> 01:26:45.316
And I was just
really scared

01:26:45.399 --> 01:26:46.692
we were never gonna
get it because...

01:26:46.776 --> 01:26:48.027
We couldn't take
it seriously.

01:26:49.737 --> 01:26:51.781
I did not make this better
because I've been told

01:26:51.864 --> 01:26:54.158
significantly that I was
just being an absolute dick

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:55.618
about this and was like,

01:26:55.701 --> 01:26:57.328
"I'm gonna come on set
and watch you guys kiss."

01:26:57.411 --> 01:26:59.205
Well, everyone wanted to be
on set for it.

01:26:59.288 --> 01:27:01.707
'Cause everyone was like,
"This is gonna be good, guys."

01:27:01.791 --> 01:27:03.334
- Like we need...
- I'm sorry about that, guys.

01:27:03.417 --> 01:27:04.836
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:27:04.919 --> 01:27:06.671
I knew I was gonna kind of
have to be the one

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:08.548
to kinda make this thing happen

01:27:08.631 --> 01:27:12.385
<i>because Rupert was not gonna,
so I just had to go for it.</i>

01:27:12.468 --> 01:27:14.095
Taking no prisoners.

01:27:14.178 --> 01:27:17.473
I needed like, momentum into
the kiss in order to do it.

01:27:17.557 --> 01:27:20.476
And Rupert's, I could almost
on that first take,

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.188
I saw Rupert's face
explode with surprise,

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:26.274
'cause he thought,
"It's only the first take."

01:27:26.357 --> 01:27:28.359
Kinda think I blacked out.
I just remember

01:27:28.442 --> 01:27:31.362
your face getting
closer and closer to mine.

01:27:31.445 --> 01:27:32.905
<i>Every time you talk
about this,</i>

01:27:32.989 --> 01:27:35.324
you make it sound
like an actual horror show

01:27:35.408 --> 01:27:36.367
in your head.

01:27:36.450 --> 01:27:38.744
It wasn't that bad. I know.

01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:52.592
<i>Kissing Rupert
is one of the hardest things</i>

01:27:52.675 --> 01:27:54.302
<i>I've ever had to do.</i>

01:27:54.385 --> 01:27:57.180
<i>It just felt wrong,</i>

01:27:57.263 --> 01:27:59.056
<i>so wrong on every level</i>

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:02.185
because Dan, Rupert, and I
are so much siblings.

01:28:06.314 --> 01:28:07.565
Harry?

01:28:07.648 --> 01:28:09.233
<i>All three of us,
I think, felt so matched</i>

01:28:09.317 --> 01:28:12.153
in how much it meant to us.

01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:15.323
<i>I remember the scene
when you were like, "No, guys,</i>

01:28:15.406 --> 01:28:17.241
<i>I'm the one who has to go
on my own kinda thing</i>

01:28:17.325 --> 01:28:19.076
on this... this one."

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.578
And I gave you the hug to say
goodbye.

01:28:20.661 --> 01:28:23.206
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.

01:28:25.666 --> 01:28:28.586
<i>I knew I was saying
goodbye to the series.</i>

01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:30.463
<i>I knew I was saying
goodbye to you.</i>

01:28:30.546 --> 01:28:32.882
<i>And I just had to just
bring to the surface</i>

01:28:32.965 --> 01:28:38.054
how I really felt
about it all coming to an end.

01:28:38.137 --> 01:28:39.555
Yeah.

01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:52.902
<i>It's a very biblical image</i>

01:28:52.985 --> 01:28:54.946
<i>carrying Harry
across the bridge.</i>

01:28:57.698 --> 01:29:00.952
<i>If you ask Jo or anyone
who's deeply involved in it,</i>

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:03.788
<i>they'll just say it's the
battle between good and evil.</i>

01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:05.331
<i>It's as simple as that.</i>

01:29:08.626 --> 01:29:11.545
<i>I owe so much to Neville
as a character.</i>

01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:13.089
<i>I was very, very shy,
I wouldn't...</i>

01:29:13.172 --> 01:29:14.715
<i>I would never
speak up in class.</i>

01:29:14.799 --> 01:29:16.008
<i>I wouldn't put my hand up
for anything</i>

01:29:16.092 --> 01:29:18.761
<i>'cause I-I very much was him.</i>

01:29:20.346 --> 01:29:24.100
Great story of Neville
is that he's the champion.

01:29:26.227 --> 01:29:27.770
<i>That wonderful bit
at the end.</i>

01:29:27.853 --> 01:29:29.814
That great speech
of Matthew's, you know.

01:29:31.732 --> 01:29:33.609
Good must prevail, of course.

01:29:34.485 --> 01:29:35.987
It doesn't matter
that Harry's gone.

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:37.446
Stand down, Neville.

01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:39.657
People die every day.

01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.492
We lost Harry tonight.

01:29:43.703 --> 01:29:47.331
He's still with us in here.

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:51.752
He didn't die in vain.

01:29:51.836 --> 01:29:53.504
<i>But the thing
that Harry Potter did for me,</i>

01:29:53.587 --> 01:29:57.383
<i>both as a... as a story
and as an actor in it...</i>

01:29:57.466 --> 01:29:59.010
But you will.

01:29:59.093 --> 01:30:01.387
<i>Was that it helped me
to find first what I'm not.</i>

01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:05.016
Harry's heart did beat for us.
For all of us.

01:30:05.099 --> 01:30:08.436
<i>Which, therefore,
by extension, found what I am.</i>

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:12.273
<i>Confrigo!</i>

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:23.576
<i>We're looking at the book,
the final confrontation</i>

01:30:23.659 --> 01:30:25.703
between Voldemort and Harry.

01:30:25.786 --> 01:30:27.079
<i>It takes place
in the Great Hall</i>

01:30:27.163 --> 01:30:29.248
<i>with a huge audience watching.</i>

01:30:29.332 --> 01:30:32.793
And I really wanted something
earthier and more intense

01:30:32.877 --> 01:30:35.296
<i>and more visceral than that.</i>

01:30:35.379 --> 01:30:39.258
Because these two adversaries
were almost joined

01:30:39.342 --> 01:30:43.721
spiritually, if you like,
in this strange, horcrux-y way,

01:30:43.804 --> 01:30:45.431
<i>I thought, wouldn't
it be wonderful</i>

01:30:45.514 --> 01:30:49.894
if Dan just grabbed Ralph
and pulled him off this tower?

01:30:49.977 --> 01:30:53.230
Come on, Tom, let's finish
this the way we started it.

01:30:53.314 --> 01:30:55.066
Together.

01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:57.568
<i>As they apparate,
they merge together</i>

01:30:57.651 --> 01:30:59.737
<i>that deep connection
that we'd sort of</i>

01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:02.865
<i>threaded through the stories
and the films,</i>

01:31:02.948 --> 01:31:04.533
<i>you'd visualize in that moment</i>

01:31:04.617 --> 01:31:06.952
before they tumbled down
into the courtyard.

01:31:11.123 --> 01:31:12.541
<i>I remember being
quite physically tired.</i>

01:31:12.625 --> 01:31:13.918
We put everything into it.

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:15.544
We were exhausted,
I think, at the end.

01:31:15.628 --> 01:31:17.421
<i>We were shooting
in cold months</i>

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:18.547
<i>and the skies were gray.</i>

01:31:18.631 --> 01:31:20.257
<i>My forearm got so tight</i>

01:31:20.341 --> 01:31:22.301
<i>'cause this thing,
this running current in you,</i>

01:31:22.385 --> 01:31:24.637
you had to...

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:26.055
<i>push it back at him.</i>

01:31:26.931 --> 01:31:30.309
<i>As well as the physical
challenge of making the films,</i>

01:31:30.393 --> 01:31:32.853
there was that small pressure
of thinking,

01:31:32.937 --> 01:31:34.605
"You're the one
who's gonna finish this.

01:31:34.688 --> 01:31:37.608
<i>"It has to go out on a high.
It has to be meaningful.</i>

01:31:37.691 --> 01:31:40.945
<i>It has to resonate.
It has to deliver."</i>

01:32:30.494 --> 01:32:33.330
- Who are you?
- Hello, my name is Emma Watson

01:32:33.414 --> 01:32:35.291
playing the part
of Hermione Granger.

01:32:35.374 --> 01:32:37.835
- I'm horrified.
- No, never.

01:32:37.918 --> 01:32:39.670
- What?
- Never mind.

01:32:39.753 --> 01:32:41.046
You rather not
be seen like this?

01:32:41.130 --> 01:32:42.590
- Yeah.
- Why?

01:32:42.673 --> 01:32:44.175
'Cause he doesn't like
the clip in his hair.

01:32:44.258 --> 01:32:46.010
- Yeah.
- Mr. Radcliffe.

01:32:46.093 --> 01:32:47.803
- Yep. Ah!
- Ah?

01:32:47.887 --> 01:32:49.263
Camera, ah!

01:32:49.346 --> 01:32:50.723
You're from the press?

01:32:50.806 --> 01:32:52.808
I'm from the press, exactly.
How did you know?

01:32:52.892 --> 01:32:54.852
It's your first day.
How does it feel?

01:32:54.935 --> 01:32:57.188
It feels
absolutely fantastic.

01:32:57.271 --> 01:32:58.397
Are you excited?

01:32:58.481 --> 01:33:01.484
Very much so. Can't wait.

01:33:01.567 --> 01:33:04.778
After all this preparation,
finally happening.

01:33:04.862 --> 01:33:07.448
Okay, get back to work.
People need to pamper you.

01:33:07.531 --> 01:33:08.991
- Yeah.
- Right.

01:33:13.662 --> 01:33:15.539
<i>What do you think about when
you think about it now, Rup?</i>

01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:16.832
<i>As you look back on...</i>

01:33:16.916 --> 01:33:18.083
like, for me,
it's very good memories.

01:33:18.167 --> 01:33:19.460
Like, what is it for you?

01:33:19.543 --> 01:33:21.128
I'm very proud
to have been part of them.

01:33:21.212 --> 01:33:23.756
I think towards the end
it was kind of a weird time,

01:33:23.839 --> 01:33:25.716
especially kind of finishing.

01:33:25.799 --> 01:33:27.384
I felt like I lost track

01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:29.553
of who I was
and who the character was.

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:32.223
I didn't really know
where they ended or began.

01:33:32.306 --> 01:33:33.641
Yeah, there were some things
that I'm just like,

01:33:33.724 --> 01:33:34.683
who... who am I?

01:33:34.767 --> 01:33:35.768
Like, what do I like to do?

01:33:35.851 --> 01:33:37.186
What... what is important to me?

01:33:37.269 --> 01:33:38.479
Like, it was weird things.

01:33:38.562 --> 01:33:39.772
Even my name
didn't feel like my name.

01:33:39.855 --> 01:33:41.106
- Yeah.
- I felt I only

01:33:41.190 --> 01:33:42.399
really knew
how to do one thing.

01:33:42.483 --> 01:33:43.817
- Yeah.
- I knew how to play Ron.

01:33:43.901 --> 01:33:45.277
Ron was my favorite character,

01:33:45.361 --> 01:33:47.571
so it was so cool
being him in the film.

01:33:47.655 --> 01:33:49.073
<i>It's almost like we did</i>

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:52.826
<i>the most extreme form
of method acting.</i>

01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:54.828
<i>It always had to end
at some point.</i>

01:33:54.912 --> 01:33:58.415
We were never gonna
be doing this forever.

01:33:58.499 --> 01:34:00.251
The way it feels for me now,

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:03.420
like, seeing you here,
having had time apart...

01:34:04.338 --> 01:34:06.298
Let me try not
to get emotional.

01:34:06.382 --> 01:34:09.009
It feels like you're like
a pillar of my life.

01:34:09.093 --> 01:34:10.261
That's a very
overwhelming thing,

01:34:10.344 --> 01:34:11.679
'cause I've watched you
grow up.

01:34:11.762 --> 01:34:12.763
We've watched each other
grow up.

01:34:12.846 --> 01:34:13.973
We grew up together.

01:34:14.056 --> 01:34:16.308
We're family.
We always will be.

01:34:16.392 --> 01:34:19.311
We don't need to see each...
oh, my God.

01:34:19.395 --> 01:34:23.357
Even though we don't see
each other all the time.

01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.192
Yeah, it's a...

01:34:26.652 --> 01:34:27.903
It's a strong...

01:34:27.987 --> 01:34:29.530
a strong bond
that we will always have.

01:34:29.613 --> 01:34:33.617
And we will always be part
of each other's lives.

01:34:44.295 --> 01:34:47.381
- Oh, it's so nice to see you.
- So good to see you.

01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:50.551
I love you.

01:34:56.557 --> 01:34:57.641
As a friend.

01:35:00.227 --> 01:35:01.812
- Just to be clear.
- Just to be clear.

01:35:01.895 --> 01:35:03.480
For everyone watching.

01:35:03.564 --> 01:35:06.817
But it's true.
There's so much love.

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:08.444
Oh, thanks, Rupes.

01:35:08.527 --> 01:35:09.987
Let's do a rehearsal,

01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:12.531
and it can playback I need
to playback from the top.

01:35:12.615 --> 01:35:14.742
When you're ready, and action.

01:35:15.868 --> 01:35:18.621
<i>When we were all wrapping up
those final scenes,</i>

01:35:18.704 --> 01:35:23.000
<i>one of the last shots
we did in the entire shoot.</i>

01:35:23.083 --> 01:35:25.461
<i>We were diving past
the camera</i>

01:35:25.544 --> 01:35:28.505
and landing
on this huge crash mat.

01:35:28.589 --> 01:35:31.175
That was what it all
came down to, this one take.

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:33.344
It was jumping in a chimney.

01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:36.847
<i>It was such a metaphor for
what was actually happening.</i>

01:35:36.930 --> 01:35:39.683
<i>We had to, like, jump
onto a mat, basically,</i>

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:41.810
to travel into another world.

01:35:42.728 --> 01:35:46.231
<i>The collective emotion
was incredibly palpable</i>

01:35:46.315 --> 01:35:48.067
<i>and... and for the people
who'd supported them</i>

01:35:48.150 --> 01:35:50.152
<i>and had been there
for them throughout.</i>

01:35:50.235 --> 01:35:53.822
<i>Everybody who'd
seen them grow up.</i>

01:35:57.618 --> 01:36:00.079
<i>On that last day,
I just lost it.</i>

01:36:02.498 --> 01:36:05.125
<i>I mean, I remember all of us
just holding each other.</i>

01:36:07.378 --> 01:36:11.882
All three of us
were, like, utterly devastated.

01:36:14.259 --> 01:36:16.387
<i>I think it was the first time
we'd allowed ourselves</i>

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:20.891
to even process
or realize we'd done it.

01:36:20.974 --> 01:36:22.810
<i>We'd made it through.</i>

01:36:22.893 --> 01:36:24.478
<i>It's so ingrained
in me as well,</i>

01:36:24.561 --> 01:36:27.272
<i>like I measure
my life with these movies.</i>

01:36:27.356 --> 01:36:29.400
So it's like, "Oh, when did you
pass your driving test?"

01:36:29.483 --> 01:36:32.194
I'm like,
"Order of the Phoenix."

01:36:32.277 --> 01:36:36.949
<i>Every part of my life
is connected to Potter.</i>

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:41.537
When I meet people who
it's a really important part

01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:44.248
of their life, or the books
or the films were in some way,

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:45.916
like, a part of their identity,

01:36:45.999 --> 01:36:48.585
it, yeah,
it just makes you really proud.

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:50.838
There's something
about Harry Potter

01:36:50.921 --> 01:36:52.589
that makes life richer.

01:36:52.673 --> 01:36:55.843
Like, when things get really
dark and times are really hard,

01:36:55.926 --> 01:36:58.262
stories give us places
we can go

01:36:58.345 --> 01:37:02.850
where we can rest
and feel held.

01:37:02.933 --> 01:37:04.601
I don't think I fully
appreciated the reach

01:37:04.685 --> 01:37:07.062
that these films had
when we were in them.

01:37:07.146 --> 01:37:08.772
The amount of people
that have said things like,

01:37:08.856 --> 01:37:10.774
"These are the only films
my dad and I watched together.

01:37:10.858 --> 01:37:12.317
"Like, we can't talk
about anything else.

01:37:12.401 --> 01:37:13.777
"And like,
we watch Harry Potter together.

01:37:13.861 --> 01:37:15.320
And that has been our thing."

01:37:15.404 --> 01:37:18.699
It's amazing to... to be
a small kind of part of that.

01:37:18.782 --> 01:37:21.952
And just seeing it kinda
relive on, finding new mediums,

01:37:22.035 --> 01:37:24.079
like the stage show,
"Fantastic Beasts."

01:37:24.163 --> 01:37:26.790
It's just kind of
living forever,

01:37:26.874 --> 01:37:28.792
and it's amazing to see it.

01:37:28.876 --> 01:37:31.587
Harry Potter! Harry Potter!

01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:34.798
There's nothing like
the stories of Harry Potter.

01:37:34.882 --> 01:37:36.175
The stories told within them,

01:37:36.258 --> 01:37:38.385
the individual
characters' journeys.

01:37:38.469 --> 01:37:39.970
<i>I just think that has such</i>

01:37:40.053 --> 01:37:42.347
<i>a transformative effect
on people.</i>

01:37:42.431 --> 01:37:43.348
<i>That's magic.</i>

01:37:43.432 --> 01:37:44.808
It's beautiful here.

01:37:44.892 --> 01:37:48.812
Every child wonders how
they're going to fit in.

01:37:48.896 --> 01:37:52.316
And it's an epic journey
that every child goes on.

01:37:52.399 --> 01:37:54.735
Dobby will always be there
for Harry Potter.

01:37:54.818 --> 01:37:56.987
It's very inspiring
for young people to go,

01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:59.531
"Oh, that could be me there
having that moment of doubt

01:37:59.615 --> 01:38:02.576
or that wobble or that argument
with my parents."

01:38:04.328 --> 01:38:06.163
Stay close to me.

01:38:06.246 --> 01:38:08.207
Until the end.

01:38:09.416 --> 01:38:12.252
I have found it
an extraordinary world

01:38:12.336 --> 01:38:13.712
to be involved with.

01:38:13.796 --> 01:38:16.423
And it's a...
it's a beautiful world.

01:38:16.507 --> 01:38:17.466
Harry.

01:38:17.549 --> 01:38:18.967
Harry.

01:38:19.051 --> 01:38:20.511
Harry.

01:38:20.594 --> 01:38:22.513
<i>And that's what's so
profoundly therapeutic</i>

01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:24.890
and good about it, is it's made

01:38:24.973 --> 01:38:27.684
people who otherwise
feel lonely,

01:38:27.768 --> 01:38:29.269
<i>they feel they belong.</i>

01:38:29.353 --> 01:38:31.230
- Don't give it to her, Harry.
- Shh.

01:38:33.065 --> 01:38:34.858
Most of the fans
that... that come up

01:38:34.942 --> 01:38:36.193
and say hello to me now

01:38:36.276 --> 01:38:38.028
weren't even born
when we made the films.

01:38:38.111 --> 01:38:42.908
So it quickly makes you feel
slightly older

01:38:42.991 --> 01:38:45.619
and very grateful

01:38:45.702 --> 01:38:49.248
that it's been passed down
to other generations.

01:38:49.331 --> 01:38:51.291
Training for the ballet,
Potter?'

01:38:55.254 --> 01:38:57.381
One of the things that
was unique about Harry Potter,

01:38:57.464 --> 01:38:59.925
besides the incredible
imagination of worlds

01:39:00.008 --> 01:39:03.720
<i>and characters
that Jo Rowling created</i>

01:39:03.804 --> 01:39:07.057
<i>was the fact that you get
to see young children</i>

01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:09.893
<i>grow into adults</i>

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:11.979
<i>and to see
that journey on film.</i>

01:39:12.062 --> 01:39:14.398
<i>I don't think we've ever
seen that before.</i>

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:16.108
<i>I don't know
if we'll ever see it again.</i>

01:39:16.191 --> 01:39:18.527
<i>It just feel so lucky
that I get to be part</i>

01:39:18.610 --> 01:39:23.073
of a world that people love
so much and makes people happy.

01:39:23.156 --> 01:39:24.283
There's something
about those...

01:39:24.366 --> 01:39:26.034
the escapism you find.

01:39:26.118 --> 01:39:27.953
<i>The healthy form of escapism.</i>

01:39:28.036 --> 01:39:30.914
<i>That, I think, is kind of
what Harry Potter does.</i>

01:39:30.998 --> 01:39:32.583
And that's what these stories
are for.

01:39:32.666 --> 01:39:34.751
They are a guide
to how to live.

01:39:34.835 --> 01:39:36.128
I just think
it's an end of an era.

01:39:36.211 --> 01:39:37.796
It's a ten... ten years
of my life.

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:40.883
My... my children are grown up
during this, of course.

01:39:40.966 --> 01:39:44.803
That is Robbie Coltrane,
finest gamekeeper in Hogwarts,

01:39:44.887 --> 01:39:46.597
last day on Harry Potter.

01:39:51.685 --> 01:39:53.729
<i>The legacy of the movies
is, I suspect,</i>

01:39:53.812 --> 01:39:55.606
<i>that my children's generation</i>

01:39:55.689 --> 01:39:58.191
<i>will show them
to their children.</i>

01:39:58.275 --> 01:40:01.194
So you could be watching it
in 50 years' time, easy.

01:40:02.279 --> 01:40:05.282
I'll not be here, sadly, but...

01:40:05.991 --> 01:40:08.785
Don't you think on it
for one minute.

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:11.747
But Hagrid will, yes.

01:40:13.206 --> 01:40:16.335
<i>Kinda looking back
at it now,</i>

01:40:16.418 --> 01:40:17.836
<i>just really fond memories.</i>

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:20.339
I think about it a lot.
It was a great time.

01:40:20.422 --> 01:40:22.382
It really was, it was...

01:40:22.466 --> 01:40:24.176
<i>it was amazing.</i>

01:40:24.259 --> 01:40:28.889
Just the best,
most amazing experience.

01:40:28.972 --> 01:40:32.392
And I can't
really explain to you...

01:40:32.476 --> 01:40:34.686
like, they're such good people.

01:40:34.770 --> 01:40:37.147
<i>They were so kind, and...</i>

01:40:37.230 --> 01:40:40.400
they both took the
responsibility very seriously.

01:40:40.484 --> 01:40:44.446
And I appreciated that so much.

01:40:44.529 --> 01:40:45.864
<i>It really is like family.</i>

01:40:45.948 --> 01:40:48.784
<i>We're just
so intrinsically linked.</i>

01:40:49.952 --> 01:40:51.995
They're very important
people to me.

01:40:52.913 --> 01:40:55.165
<i>The crew on these films
were unbelievable.</i>

01:40:55.248 --> 01:40:58.877
There are people
on these films that are...

01:40:58.961 --> 01:41:03.757
are foundational to who I am...

01:41:06.259 --> 01:41:09.513
As a person and an actor.

01:41:09.596 --> 01:41:11.515
<i>I feel so lucky
to be where I am</i>

01:41:11.598 --> 01:41:13.267
<i>and to have the life
that I have</i>

01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:16.061
and be able to work with
the people I work with now,

01:41:16.144 --> 01:41:20.232
but none of it is possible
without this.

01:41:20.315 --> 01:41:24.778
So yeah, it was... it was very...

01:41:24.861 --> 01:41:26.822
it was a very good ten years.

01:41:30.450 --> 01:41:33.578
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

01:41:44.881 --> 01:41:47.676
After all this time?

01:41:47.759 --> 01:41:49.803
Always.
