WEBVTT

00:10.358 --> 00:11.924
Sir.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.100
With rush hour traffic,
you're going to be late

00:13.143 --> 00:14.405
for your 8:00 a.m.
staff meeting.

00:14.449 --> 00:16.059
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19.497 --> 00:22.674
[sighs]
Where is he?

00:26.591 --> 00:30.334
["Anchors Aweigh" ringtone
plays in distance]

00:30.378 --> 00:31.988
It's coming from over there!

00:36.732 --> 00:38.603
[ringtone continues]

00:41.737 --> 00:44.044
[ringtone continues]

00:59.972 --> 01:02.192
["Anchors Aweigh" continues]

01:37.793 --> 01:39.316
McGee!

01:39.360 --> 01:41.710
Look what was waiting for me
when I got home last night.

01:41.753 --> 01:43.277
Your passport?

01:43.320 --> 01:46.628
My United States
of America passport.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.282
Ziva, congratulations.

01:48.325 --> 01:49.892
God, that's great.
Can I-- can I peek?

01:49.935 --> 01:51.850
Yeah.

01:51.894 --> 01:54.723
Oh, see, that is unfair.

01:54.766 --> 01:56.899
No one's passport picture
should look this good.

01:56.942 --> 01:58.553
You think?

01:58.596 --> 02:01.077
Yeah. I mean, where'd you
have it taken, a photo studio?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.774
No. A booth at
the Post Office.

02:04.036 --> 02:06.213
Hey, Tony!
Look what Ziva got.

02:06.256 --> 02:09.041
Congratulations.
I'll alert the media.

02:09.085 --> 02:10.782
Wow, you're in
a great mood.

02:10.826 --> 02:13.089
[sighs]
You know, I was.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.310
Until I woke up this morning
and saw that my father called.

02:16.353 --> 02:17.746
What did he want?

02:17.789 --> 02:19.574
I don't know.

02:19.617 --> 02:20.966
I haven't called him back yet.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.577
Maybe he needs something, Tony.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.970
That's a given.
He called at 4:30 a.m.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.711
I was having
such a good week.

02:26.755 --> 02:28.409
Okay.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.628
When was the last time
you heard from him?

02:30.672 --> 02:32.282
[sighs]

02:32.326 --> 02:34.197
I don't know.
Couple months ago.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.459
[keys clatter]

02:35.503 --> 02:36.765
Where we going, boss?

02:36.808 --> 02:38.288
U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.646
Looks like they went
through his pockets.

02:48.690 --> 02:51.040
Wonder what they were
trying to find.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.868
They didn't take the wallet,
watch or cell phone.

02:52.911 --> 02:56.088
Make a note, would you, to have
Abby check for trace evidence?

02:56.132 --> 02:57.916
Uh, yeah, thanks
for that, Tony.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.048
I would have done it anyway.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.223
ZIVA:
Hey, guys!

03:07.099 --> 03:08.275
[sighs]

03:11.452 --> 03:13.193
Someone's going
to have to go through this.

03:13.236 --> 03:15.499
This is disgusting.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.501
Last time I checked,
I was senior field agent.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.503
It's too bad we don't have
a probationary agent with us.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.724
But we do!
We do!

03:22.767 --> 03:24.204
You're going to pull rank on me?

03:29.165 --> 03:31.036
[sighs]

03:33.430 --> 03:36.303
I got a call from Woody.

03:36.346 --> 03:37.739
Woke me up before dawn
this morning.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.871
Very cryptic.

03:39.915 --> 03:41.133
What do you mean?

03:41.177 --> 03:42.439
Said he wanted
to show me something.

03:42.483 --> 03:45.442
Asked me to meet him here.

03:45.486 --> 03:48.576
But it was like he thought
he was being bugged.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.969
He just said, "At the exact
spot we first met."

03:51.013 --> 03:53.102
Here in front
of Fowler Hall?
Yeah.

03:53.145 --> 03:54.669
We were plebes together.

03:54.712 --> 03:55.800
Met right here,

03:55.844 --> 03:57.367
I-Day, 1973.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.761
You have no idea what
he meant by that?

03:59.804 --> 04:01.023
No. None.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.547
I haven't spoken to him
in two or three years.

04:03.591 --> 04:05.157
After he retired from the Navy,

04:05.201 --> 04:07.159
he went to work
in the private sector.

04:07.203 --> 04:09.510
What's your assignment,
Admiral Chase?

04:09.553 --> 04:11.990
Are you asking me
because you want to know

04:12.034 --> 04:13.775
if Iverson was coming to see me

04:13.818 --> 04:15.472
about something personal
or my job?

04:15.516 --> 04:18.214
I asked you what your
assignment was, sir.

04:18.258 --> 04:22.218
I don't think this is the place
for that discussion.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.002
I'm overdue
at the Pentagon.

04:24.046 --> 04:27.136
I'll get in touch
with NCIS this afternoon.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.412
Everything okay, boss?

04:45.154 --> 04:47.069
Find out what exactly

04:47.112 --> 04:48.810
Admiral Chase does
do at the Pentagon.

04:48.853 --> 04:50.246
Got it.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.769
What you got, Duck?

04:51.813 --> 04:53.945
Well, at this point,
I can only estimate

04:53.989 --> 04:55.817
the time of death
as early this morning.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.732
And there are no
definitive signs of cause.

04:57.775 --> 05:00.343
Well, I did note
a foreign substance

05:00.387 --> 05:02.780
beneath the nail
of his right forefinger.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.782
Analysis to follow.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.175
[sighs]

05:06.218 --> 05:09.265
Can't you just sense
the esprit de corps?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.745
You might be
interested to know

05:10.788 --> 05:12.486
that your college
here in Annapolis

05:12.529 --> 05:13.922
was founded in 1845.

05:13.965 --> 05:16.011
That's almost 20 years
before its British equivalent

05:16.054 --> 05:17.578
in Dartmouth in Devonshire.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.493
Yeah, my father wanted me

05:19.536 --> 05:21.233
to attend the Britannia
Royal Naval College,

05:21.277 --> 05:23.235
but I had other ideas. I...

05:23.279 --> 05:24.541
Sorry, Duck.
Sorry, Duck.

05:24.585 --> 05:27.109
Boss, uh, uh,
Vice Admiral C. Clifford Chase

05:27.152 --> 05:29.067
is part of the E-ring.

05:29.111 --> 05:30.504
He's the deputy director
of operations

05:30.547 --> 05:32.419
for the Joint Chiefs
of Staff.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.598
ZIVA: Woodrow Wilson Iverson
retired from the Navy

05:37.641 --> 05:39.426
with the rank of
commander 18 years ago

05:39.469 --> 05:41.950
to join Royce Global Group,

05:41.993 --> 05:43.865
the international mining
and shipping company.

05:43.908 --> 05:46.041
TONY:
It was founded by the legendary
business titan

05:46.084 --> 05:48.391
Jonathon Royce.
He's become

05:48.435 --> 05:50.567
sort of like a Howard Hughes
recluse since the death

05:50.611 --> 05:52.482
of his son in a
racing accident

05:52.526 --> 05:54.441
at Le Mans four years ago.
Hasn't been seen

05:54.484 --> 05:56.356
in public since the
funeral, and rumor is,

05:56.399 --> 05:58.227
he's holed up in a chalet
in Gstaad, Switzerland.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.708
His sole remaining heir is his
daughter Rachel, who lives in

06:00.751 --> 06:01.883
Bridgehampton, Long Island.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.885
Iverson left
from Geneva International

06:03.928 --> 06:05.887
aboard a Royce jet, and passed

06:05.930 --> 06:09.456
through Dulles customs
at 3:12 a.m. this morning.

06:09.499 --> 06:10.805
Uh, plane's manifest shows

06:10.848 --> 06:12.894
a crew of three and, uh,

06:12.937 --> 06:13.938
four passengers.

06:13.982 --> 06:15.853
Names?

06:17.202 --> 06:18.900
You okay, McGee?

06:18.943 --> 06:20.423
Uh, I am fine.

06:20.467 --> 06:23.078
I'm fine.
Sorry, boss.

06:23.121 --> 06:25.863
Uh, this is security
video taken at

06:25.907 --> 06:27.125
the executive terminal.

06:27.169 --> 06:29.040
Theo Gaston,

06:29.084 --> 06:31.695
Swiss national, corporate
head of security.

06:33.305 --> 06:35.046
Dan Mayfield,

06:35.090 --> 06:37.397
C.O.O., and Royce's
right-hand man.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.574
That is Woody Iverson,

06:40.617 --> 06:42.271
our victim.

06:43.925 --> 06:46.623
Tony?

06:46.667 --> 06:48.799
That...

06:48.843 --> 06:50.279
looks like
your father.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.064
TONY:
No.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.414
It can't be.

06:54.457 --> 06:55.458
Oh, it is.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.155
Manifest reads,

06:57.199 --> 06:58.287
"Anthony D. DiNozzo, Sr.,

06:58.330 --> 07:01.072
New York,
New York."

07:13.694 --> 07:16.392
Passengers Mayfield and Gaston
are on the way in.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.090
My father's not answering.
I got voicemail again.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.831
Track his cell, McGee.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.225
Why didn't I take his
call this morning?

07:23.268 --> 07:25.706
I'm sure he's all right, Tony.

07:25.749 --> 07:26.968
He looked fine
getting off the plane.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.186
Yeah, so did the guy

07:28.230 --> 07:29.536
in front of him, and
he ended up dead,

07:29.579 --> 07:30.798
crammed in a Dumpster.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.190
Slow down, DiNozzo.

07:32.234 --> 07:33.801
McGEE:
All right, I got a hit.

07:33.844 --> 07:36.934
15100 1st Street, Northeast.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.719
Mid-Atlantic
Trailways bus station.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.242
This is worse
than I thought.

07:40.285 --> 07:43.027
My father... at a bus station?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.074
Ziva?

07:49.860 --> 07:51.601
On it.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.392
Thank you.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.613
Woody Iverson
and I began working

08:03.657 --> 08:06.529
for Jonathon Royce
about the same time.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.009
18 years ago.

08:10.751 --> 08:14.537
Why was, uh, Iverson in
Washington, Mr. Mayfield?

08:14.581 --> 08:16.626
We flew in for the annual
Royce Summit.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.323
It's an international
trade symposium

08:18.367 --> 08:20.587
Jonathon initiated
ten years ago.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.458
Is he here?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.460
No, no. He doesn't
attend anymore.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.244
But it is
a sought-after invitation

08:26.288 --> 08:27.768
from industrial buyers.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.987
They come, they meet,
exchange ideas.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.685
Deals are made.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.948
Huh.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.124
Either one of you
have any idea

08:36.167 --> 08:39.475
where Iverson was going
after he left the airport?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.564
No idea.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.610
We had a limo
to take us into town,

08:43.653 --> 08:47.265
but Woody said he had something
to do and would take a cab.

08:47.309 --> 08:49.398
There was another
passenger

08:49.441 --> 08:51.574
on the plane he left with.
He might know.

08:51.618 --> 08:54.577
Anthony DiNozzo?

08:54.621 --> 08:56.187
They shared a cab.

08:56.231 --> 08:58.450
What's, uh...

08:58.494 --> 09:00.801
What's Mr. DiNozzo's
connection to Royce Global?

09:00.844 --> 09:02.367
He and Jonathon
go way back.

09:02.411 --> 09:04.979
They met in Gstaad
years ago.

09:05.022 --> 09:08.504
They gambled, skied,
chased women together.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.420
DiNozzo was hanging around the
corporate terminal in Geneva,

09:11.463 --> 09:13.422
looking for a ride.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.816
I checked with Jonathon.
He said it was fine.

09:15.859 --> 09:19.080
So, the last time you saw
Iverson, he was with DiNozzo?

09:19.123 --> 09:20.385
Yes, sir.

09:24.259 --> 09:26.348
ZIVA:
There he is, Tony.

09:26.391 --> 09:27.392
Thank God he's all right.

09:27.436 --> 09:28.611
Give me a second.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.787
This is unbelievable. Dad?

09:30.831 --> 09:32.789
Dad?

09:32.833 --> 09:34.530
Junior.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.098
What are you doing here?

09:37.141 --> 09:38.490
In Washington?

09:38.534 --> 09:40.928
At a bus station.

09:40.971 --> 09:43.887
Why didn't you answer my call?

09:43.931 --> 09:46.324
Well, you did call me
in the middle of the night,

09:46.368 --> 09:47.543
and I did return it.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.979
When?

09:49.023 --> 09:49.763
Half an hour ago.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.810
Blocked I.D.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.508
You know I don't
accept blocked calls.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.251
How'd you find me?

10:00.295 --> 10:02.645
I'm a federal agent, Dad.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.256
That doesn't give you a
right to violate my privacy.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.997
Uh... what else do you know?

10:07.041 --> 10:09.391
I know you arrived

10:09.434 --> 10:11.306
this morning
on a Royce Global private jet

10:11.349 --> 10:13.003
around 3:00 a.m.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.701
You keeping tabs
on me, Junior?

10:14.744 --> 10:16.746
I'm investigating
a murder, Dad.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.530
Murder?

10:18.574 --> 10:21.098
Woody Iverson.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.579
What happened?

10:23.623 --> 10:26.451
We need you to come down
to the Navy Yard.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.714
Yeah.

10:27.757 --> 10:31.282
Oh. Is, uh, that Ziva?

10:31.326 --> 10:33.110
Yeah.

10:33.154 --> 10:35.765
Junior, get my bag.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.071
Oh...

10:37.114 --> 10:39.029
Oh, Ziva!

10:39.073 --> 10:41.118
Look at you.

10:41.162 --> 10:41.902
What do you say, sweetheart?ZIVA: Hi.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.383
Watch the hands.[giggles]

10:45.427 --> 10:47.081
I'm so happy
to see you.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.952
Let's go!

10:51.563 --> 10:53.435
[sighs]

11:00.094 --> 11:01.922
Here we are again,
Agent Gibbs.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.491
I was shocked to hear
about Woody Iverson.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.975
How long have
you known him?

11:12.019 --> 11:13.934
About 24 hours.

11:13.977 --> 11:16.588
Uh, met him in Geneva
at the airport.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.155
Right.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.767
You hitched a ride
on the Royce jet.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.290
Ah. I confess.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.379
I am a plane whore.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.120
I hate to fly
commercial.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.339
Ever fly in a G5?

11:28.383 --> 11:31.038
It is a whole
different world.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.039
[chuckles]

11:34.476 --> 11:38.001
Did you, uh, talk to
Iverson on the flight?

11:38.045 --> 11:42.484
Um, Mayfield and I played gin,
drank 30-year-old scotch.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.573
[chuckles]
I took him for a hundred bucks.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.488
Iverson sat by himself.

11:47.663 --> 11:49.839
So he never spoke to anyone?

11:49.883 --> 11:53.277
Briefly, about the summit
that they were flying in for.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.453
Mayfield invited me
to the opening night reception

11:55.497 --> 11:57.455
at Jonathon Royce's mansion.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.675
Are you going?

11:59.719 --> 12:02.112
No, I think he was
just being polite--

12:02.156 --> 12:04.680
because of my relationship
with Jonathon.

12:04.724 --> 12:08.292
Did you, uh, see Royce
while you were in Switzerland?

12:08.336 --> 12:09.729
No.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.253
Not for years.

12:12.296 --> 12:14.124
He doesn't talk to anybody.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.649
We through?

12:18.825 --> 12:20.783
So...

12:20.827 --> 12:24.439
you never talked to
Iverson on the plane...

12:26.180 --> 12:27.790
...but you did

12:27.834 --> 12:29.357
share a cab into the city?

12:30.532 --> 12:31.838
Yeah.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.451
I'm beginning to feel
like a suspect.

12:36.494 --> 12:38.627
I don't expect, uh,
special treatment

12:38.670 --> 12:41.543
because I'm Junior's
father, and I accept

12:41.586 --> 12:44.807
that you and I will
never be friends, Gibbs...

12:44.851 --> 12:47.679
but I don't like your tone.

12:47.723 --> 12:50.378
You were the last person
to see Iverson alive.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.815
How I feel about you personally,

12:52.859 --> 12:54.512
it's irrelevant.

12:54.556 --> 12:57.472
This is a murder
investigation,

12:57.515 --> 12:59.343
and I'll follow it
wherever it leads.

12:59.387 --> 13:01.693
Iverson was taking
a taxi into town.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.826
I asked him if I
could share a ride.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.915
He dropped me
at the Adams House.

13:05.959 --> 13:09.701
He never mentioned where
he was going from there. Hmm?

13:09.745 --> 13:12.313
[phone rings]

13:12.356 --> 13:14.184
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

13:15.969 --> 13:17.709
Mm-hmm. I'll be right there.

13:23.411 --> 13:24.760
[door closes]

13:24.804 --> 13:26.849
Huh.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.069
What?
He's lying.

13:29.112 --> 13:31.767
He never registered at the
Adams House-- I checked.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.421
[sighs]

13:33.464 --> 13:35.684
What is he up to?

13:35.727 --> 13:37.860
CHASE:
Woody Iverson was a friend.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.383
I have reason to believe

13:39.427 --> 13:42.691
that his death may have
national security implications.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.736
And we have to make
sure that you have

13:44.780 --> 13:45.868
the correct personnel
on this case, Director.

13:48.175 --> 13:51.134
Gibbs and his team can
definitely handle it.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.570
[knocking]Come in.

13:54.355 --> 13:55.791
Admiral Chase has

13:55.835 --> 13:56.879
some information for us.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.186
CHASE: Yes.
When I got back

13:59.229 --> 14:01.928
to the Pentagon,
I conferred with my
intelligence officers...

14:01.971 --> 14:03.799
At the Joint Chiefs?

14:03.843 --> 14:05.888
Yeah.

14:05.932 --> 14:09.065
Our analysts use Echelon
to electronically intercept

14:09.109 --> 14:11.894
the words "Iverson"
and "Royce Global."

14:11.938 --> 14:13.113
They picked up chatter

14:13.156 --> 14:14.854
regarding Royce's
summit tomorrow in DC.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.681
Seems to be
a great deal of interest

14:16.725 --> 14:17.682
from international arms dealers

14:17.726 --> 14:20.076
who haven't attended
in past years.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.557
Royce made his billions in
shipping and mining, not arms.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.777
Maybe we
should notify NSA.

14:25.821 --> 14:26.822
I'll brief them.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.215
We have to
act quickly.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.521
Surveilling this conference
is gonna be difficult.

14:30.565 --> 14:31.914
It's civilian.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.263
It's heavily
secured.

14:33.307 --> 14:35.265
The guest list is
highly restricted.

14:35.309 --> 14:36.353
Excuse me.

14:42.229 --> 14:43.186
But you just
got here.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.231
Don't you want
to stay

14:44.274 --> 14:45.710
a couple of days?
You could have

14:45.754 --> 14:47.582
some quality time with Tony.

14:47.625 --> 14:48.931
I'd love to,
Abby, but...

14:48.975 --> 14:50.672
I have to get back
to New York.

14:50.715 --> 14:51.760
I've been away too long.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.936
We barely
got to see you.
Yeah.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.069
We were kind of hoping
to hear yourversion

14:56.112 --> 14:58.593
of why Junior got expelled
from boarding school.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.377
In your wildest dreams, McGee.
Let's go, Dad.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.726
What's the matter
with you, Junior?

15:01.770 --> 15:02.989
Relax.

15:03.032 --> 15:06.383
GIBBS:
Hey, DiNozzo, hold on a minute.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.645
Don't move.

15:07.689 --> 15:08.995
Stay.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.997
[sighs]
Yeah, boss?
Hey.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.086
Where's your dad going?

15:13.129 --> 15:14.565
New York.
No.

15:14.609 --> 15:15.827
No, not yet.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.003
We need him.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.918
To get us into
the reception.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.925
[laughs]

15:25.968 --> 15:27.970
[chuckling]

15:38.285 --> 15:39.764
I'll wait.

15:45.509 --> 15:48.208
Using my father
is a very bad idea.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.470
No other option, DiNozzo.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.559
You don't know
him like I do.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.343
It can lead to
nothing but trouble.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.171
Summit starts
tomorrow night.

15:55.215 --> 15:56.999
He's our entree.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.175
Okay.

15:59.219 --> 16:01.830
But please, he can't
stay at my place.

16:01.873 --> 16:02.570
TONY SR.:
Thanks, Donald.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.052
Well, we got lucky.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.575
What do you mean?

16:07.618 --> 16:08.968
Well, this town
is booked.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.318
There's not a decent
hotel room to be found.

16:11.361 --> 16:14.147
But I used my influence
on Donald, the concierge

16:14.190 --> 16:15.713
at the Adams House,

16:15.757 --> 16:17.367
and got the last
room available.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.412
What floor?

16:18.455 --> 16:19.804
Penthouse.

16:24.157 --> 16:26.942
You see? Who do you think's
gonna pay for that? Not him.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.422
Call the cashier.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.772
Get a purchase order to cover
the cost of the room.

16:30.815 --> 16:31.599
But...

16:33.079 --> 16:34.776
[exhales]

16:37.735 --> 16:40.042
McGEE: Isn't 310
a Los Angeles area code?

16:40.086 --> 16:42.566
ABBY:
Yep. Why?Well, the last entry

16:42.610 --> 16:44.742
Iverson made on the
notepad in his cell phone

16:44.786 --> 16:46.353
was at 4:42 a.m.

16:46.396 --> 16:48.703
That was about 20
minutes after the cab

16:48.746 --> 16:50.705
dropped Tony's father
off at the hotel.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.272
See, this looks like
a phone number to me.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.796
310-555-0142.

16:54.839 --> 16:57.973
[sighs] All the
billions and billions

16:58.017 --> 16:59.496
of binary possibilities,
all those little

16:59.540 --> 17:00.628
ones and zeros

17:00.671 --> 17:02.238
being compared,
and now

17:02.282 --> 17:03.326
the DNA search
is complete.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.634
Oh, drat!What's wrong?

17:06.677 --> 17:09.332
Ducky found DNA underneath
the victim's fingernails,

17:09.376 --> 17:11.117
and I ran it
through CODIS.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.249
Ooh. Tony's father?

17:13.293 --> 17:15.860
McGee, that's not funny.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.123
I was just kidding. Sorry.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.733
No, I didn't
get a match.

17:18.776 --> 17:21.127
So now I have to
expand the search to
all the international

17:21.170 --> 17:22.824
databases, and it's
going to take me

17:22.867 --> 17:24.173
forever.

17:24.217 --> 17:26.088
I just think Tony

17:26.132 --> 17:28.873
is too judgmental
of his father.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.050
Well, Abbs, Tony didn't
have a normal childhood.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.269
I mean, Senior wasn't
exactly Cliff Huxtable.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.750
No, I know, but Mr. D's...

17:35.793 --> 17:37.534
getting older now--
I think he's trying

17:37.578 --> 17:38.796
to make up for his mistakes.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.233
Tony's lucky...

17:40.276 --> 17:42.148
he still has a father.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.323
I mean...

17:43.366 --> 17:45.629
I wish mine were alive.

17:45.673 --> 17:48.284
I would forgive him
for anything.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.286
[clicking]

17:52.897 --> 17:53.985
That's strange.

17:54.029 --> 17:54.943
Hmm? What?

17:56.553 --> 17:59.121
I'm getting a low-level
radiation reading

17:59.165 --> 18:01.167
off the victim's pocket,
but there's nothing here.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.168
Color me confused.

18:02.211 --> 18:03.821
Yeah, color me, too.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.954
I just Googled the 310 number,

18:05.997 --> 18:08.391
got the home page
of a Beverly Hills
wellness center.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.393
They specialize in colonics

18:10.437 --> 18:12.308
and herbal enemas.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.442
Ew.
Ew.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.925
TONY SR.:
Looking for me?

18:20.969 --> 18:22.231
Went down to the spa.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.711
Steam and a massage.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.321
Needed it.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.976
Never used to get jet lag.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.202
I wasn't expecting
any guests tonight.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.813
Checking up on me?

18:38.856 --> 18:40.597
No. I just wanted to talk to you

18:40.641 --> 18:42.469
without your son being on
the other side of the glass.

18:42.512 --> 18:46.647
Have a seat.

18:46.690 --> 18:50.041
No. I'm not going to be here
that long.

18:50.085 --> 18:53.436
Tony thinks that it's a
mistake to involve you

18:53.480 --> 18:55.264
in an NCIS investigation.

18:55.308 --> 18:58.180
What do you think?

18:58.224 --> 19:01.314
Well, I think I'm
sticking my neck out.

19:01.357 --> 19:04.708
But I wanted to look
you in the eye

19:04.752 --> 19:06.884
and see if I'm wrong.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.191
And?

19:09.235 --> 19:10.714
And I think you're...

19:10.758 --> 19:14.065
just enough of a con man to
be able to pull it off.

19:14.109 --> 19:16.459
That is a strange thing to say

19:16.503 --> 19:19.723
to someone you're
asking to do you a favor.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.812
[chuckles]

19:25.599 --> 19:27.775
Are you enjoying
yourself, Mr. DiNozzo?

19:27.818 --> 19:29.951
Well, I have a certain kind

19:29.994 --> 19:33.084
of lifestyle,
Agent Gibbs.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.434
Yeah.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.523
Well, you can cut the act.
I know you're broke.

19:38.873 --> 19:42.006
Why do you and
Junior believe that?

19:42.050 --> 19:44.574
Did Tony talk to you about
your money problem?

19:44.618 --> 19:49.536
No. His actions speak louder
than his lack of words.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.712
Last year
when I stayed here,

19:51.755 --> 19:54.062
Junior picked up
my hotel bill,

19:54.105 --> 19:55.846
paid for my flight
to Monte Carlo.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.413
He wanted me to believe

19:57.457 --> 20:00.199
that it was a gift from
Prince Omar Ibn Alwaan.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.985
Is this some sort
of game you two play?

20:06.074 --> 20:09.991
Have you ever just been
honest with each other?

20:10.034 --> 20:14.213
There may be things that
I haven't told my son...

20:18.695 --> 20:22.221
...but I have never lied to him.

20:24.353 --> 20:27.008
You probably
won't believe this, Gibbs,

20:27.051 --> 20:29.358
but, uh...
I'm starting to like you.

20:29.402 --> 20:32.492
You're not afraid
to say what you think.

20:32.535 --> 20:34.102
Champagne?

20:35.886 --> 20:39.542
As Bogey said in Casablanca,

20:39.586 --> 20:44.939
"This could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship."

20:44.982 --> 20:46.593
Hmm?

20:52.468 --> 20:55.297
I do not understand.

20:55.341 --> 20:59.040
Yesterday morning, you were
upset that your father called.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.303
Now, you're upset that
he did not want to go

21:01.347 --> 21:02.739
to dinner with
you last night.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.393
He gave me a lame excuse.What?

21:04.437 --> 21:08.005
He said he'd already eaten
and he wanted to turn in early.

21:08.049 --> 21:10.225
Tony, your father flew
all the way from Europe.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.662
I can understand
that he is tired.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.577
"Tired" is not a word
in his vocabulary.

21:14.621 --> 21:15.752
[sighs]

21:15.796 --> 21:16.797
Wonderful. Thanks very much.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.974
Boss, I got something.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.454
Figure out why
Iverson was calling

21:21.497 --> 21:22.759
for a colonic
in the middle of the night?

21:22.803 --> 21:23.717
He wasn't.

21:26.023 --> 21:27.373
It didn't make sense.

21:27.416 --> 21:29.462
If it was a phone number,
he would have kept it

21:29.505 --> 21:30.854
in the contact list,
not in the notepad.

21:30.898 --> 21:32.203
So why did he?

21:32.247 --> 21:34.205
To make a notation so he
could remember something.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.469
What?

21:36.512 --> 21:38.384
The cab that he was riding in.

21:38.427 --> 21:40.690
The last seven digits turn out
to be the phone number

21:40.734 --> 21:42.692
for the Downtown DC
Taxi Company.

21:42.736 --> 21:46.522
The 310 is a reference to the
cab he was in, not an area code.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.916
Why would Iverson make a
note of the cab number?

21:48.959 --> 21:50.831
Whoever killed Iverson
went through his pockets,

21:50.874 --> 21:52.136
looking for something.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.878
Maybe Iverson hid whatever
it was in the vehicle.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.750
I've called
the dispatcher,

21:56.793 --> 21:58.317
talked to the cabbie, and
they're bringing the taxi in.

22:01.711 --> 22:05.106
The cabbie said that Iverson
was acting "very hinky."

22:05.149 --> 22:06.629
Kept looking out
the back window.

22:06.673 --> 22:10.503
Hey! I got something.

22:10.546 --> 22:13.070
This was wedged between
the cushion and the seat-back.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.290
McGEE:
"MK-15."

22:15.334 --> 22:16.770
It's got
a serial number.

22:16.813 --> 22:17.945
Hmm.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.078
[clicking]

22:22.732 --> 22:25.909
It's beta particles
and gamma rays.

22:25.953 --> 22:28.782
Almost identical to what
I found in the victim's pocket.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.566
Why is this radioactive?

22:30.610 --> 22:32.046
Well, when in doubt,
try the Internet.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.971
Hydrogen bomb?

22:45.364 --> 22:48.976
McGEE:
"March 10, 1956,

22:49.019 --> 22:50.847
"a B-47 carrying a
Mark-15 warhead

22:50.891 --> 22:53.937
"bearing the serial
number 47787

22:53.981 --> 22:55.896
"disappeared during
a scheduled air-to-air

22:55.939 --> 22:58.507
"refueling over
the Mediterranean Sea.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.379
"After becoming lost
in a thick cloud bank,

23:00.422 --> 23:01.902
the plane
was never heard from again."

23:01.945 --> 23:03.382
"Its wreckage,
including

23:03.425 --> 23:05.514
"the 3.4 megaton

23:05.558 --> 23:07.603
hydrogen bomb,
was never found."

23:07.647 --> 23:10.127
Boss, this is about a
lost nuclear weapon.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.390
A broken arrow.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.261
3.4 megatons?

23:13.304 --> 23:15.045
That's a hundred
times more powerful

23:15.089 --> 23:16.786
than the bomb dropped
on Hiroshima.

23:16.830 --> 23:19.789
If they got the plate,
then they found the bomb.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.574
And the nuclear
material.

23:29.843 --> 23:32.193
CHASE: That's what
Woody Iverson wanted to show me?

23:32.236 --> 23:34.543
We think he was being followed
and hid it in the cab.

23:34.587 --> 23:37.111
We've sent the plate to
NMCC for verification.

23:37.154 --> 23:41.158
It's definitely the Mark-15
that went missing 54 years ago.

23:41.202 --> 23:44.988
Well, that much time underwater,
the bomb is inoperable.

23:45.032 --> 23:47.861
But the... the nuclear material
has a half-life

23:47.904 --> 23:49.863
of several
million years.

23:49.906 --> 23:51.430
Well, we've always
feared terrorists getting

23:51.473 --> 23:53.475
their hands on a nuke.It's the
first broken arrow

23:53.519 --> 23:55.434
that's actually come back
to haunt us.

23:55.477 --> 23:58.219
Gentlemen, this whole
situation's gotten a lot

23:58.262 --> 24:00.700
bigger than a homicide
investigation.

24:00.743 --> 24:02.789
We'll take it from here.

24:02.832 --> 24:04.312
I've already
spoken to SecNav.

24:04.355 --> 24:06.836
This is
an NCIS investigation.

24:09.535 --> 24:12.233
Do I need to remind you why
we're a civilian-run agency?

24:12.276 --> 24:13.930
With all due respect,

24:13.974 --> 24:15.541
Admiral, those stars
on your shoulder

24:15.584 --> 24:17.673
don't carry much weight
in this building.

24:17.717 --> 24:20.415
Sir, if you want to be briefed
on where we are so far,

24:20.459 --> 24:21.721
what we know,
you're welcome to stay.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.287
That's up to you.

24:31.731 --> 24:33.820
Royce Group is deeply involved
in underwater mining.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.778
Their vessel,
the Global Seeker,

24:35.822 --> 24:37.954
is purportedly
in the Mediterranean,

24:37.998 --> 24:41.044
exploring the ocean floor
for "polymetallic nodules."

24:41.088 --> 24:42.524
GIBBS: They could've
stumbled on the wreckage

24:42.568 --> 24:45.048
of the plane, found the weapon
while they were dredging.

24:45.092 --> 24:47.137
Why didn't they contact
the U.S. government?

24:47.181 --> 24:48.878
Iverson was looking for you.

24:48.922 --> 24:51.141
Someone stopped him.

24:51.185 --> 24:54.144
Royce has some
questions to answer.

24:54.188 --> 24:55.972
Well, we don't know how
involved Royce is anymore.

24:56.016 --> 24:59.280
No one has seen him or heard
from him in four years.

24:59.323 --> 25:01.456
We think his C.O.O.,
Dan Mayfield, runs the show.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.458
Are you going to bring
this Mayfield in?

25:03.502 --> 25:04.633
No. Not yet.

25:04.677 --> 25:05.852
That's all
conjecture, Admiral.

25:05.895 --> 25:08.202
If they've
recovered the nuke,

25:08.245 --> 25:09.464
we don't want to spook them.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.205
Your intel people
received chatter

25:11.248 --> 25:14.164
about the
Royce Summit, right?
Mm-hmm.

25:14.208 --> 25:16.079
We're going to infiltrate
that opening-night reception.

25:19.735 --> 25:23.304
McGEE: Royce's mansion was
extensively renovated in 2002.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.219
I got the blueprints
from the city engineer.

25:25.262 --> 25:26.742
During the summit,

25:26.786 --> 25:29.266
Mayfield holds his private
meetings here, in the study.

25:29.310 --> 25:31.051
That's where
we should plant the bug.

25:31.094 --> 25:33.314
Theo Gaston,
head of security,

25:33.357 --> 25:35.229
is supplementing his staff
with local hires.

25:35.272 --> 25:37.492
I've been unable
to obtain the guest list,

25:37.536 --> 25:40.016
but, uh, there is a video
security system in the house

25:40.060 --> 25:41.061
connected
to the Internet.

25:41.104 --> 25:42.584
I think I can
hack into it.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.455
I've got faith in you, Tim.
The van ready?

25:44.499 --> 25:46.632
Uh, still got
some equipment to load.Good. Go, go.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.332
What?

25:51.375 --> 25:52.899
Using my father
is a mistake.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.901
I've heard that before, DiNozzo.He's untrained.

25:54.944 --> 25:55.945
He won't know
what to look for.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.120
I mean, sure, he
can work a room,

25:57.164 --> 25:58.295
and he's a charmer,
but come on!

25:58.339 --> 25:59.209
We both know this
is different.

25:59.253 --> 26:01.690
He's not going in alone.

26:01.734 --> 26:02.909
He's being accompanied
by an agent.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.780
Oh, no, boss. I-I...

26:04.824 --> 26:06.434
This is a bad idea.

26:06.477 --> 26:08.044
I mean, I know
where you're going,

26:08.088 --> 26:09.524
and he and I don't
work well together.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.699
Oil and water.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.658
I got another agent in mind.

26:12.701 --> 26:14.442
One who speaks
a bunch of languages

26:14.485 --> 26:15.835
and looks a lot better
in a dress.

26:15.878 --> 26:17.967
You'regoing
with my father?

26:18.011 --> 26:20.579
Oh... This is crazy!

26:20.622 --> 26:21.884
Your father doesn't think so.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.103
He sent me flowers.

26:23.146 --> 26:25.322
DiNozzo, you're so
worried about your father,

26:25.366 --> 26:26.933
then go to the hotel
and check on him.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.151
Make sure he's ready.

26:28.195 --> 26:29.370
That's what I'll do.

26:31.285 --> 26:33.330
Uh, Special Agent Gibbs?

26:33.374 --> 26:34.418
What, Fred?

26:34.462 --> 26:35.463
I have a problem.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.900
Uh, Anthony DiNozzo, Sr.

26:37.944 --> 26:40.773
is not only staying
in a $1,500-a-night suite,

26:40.816 --> 26:42.949
he's also running up
a huge tab.

26:42.992 --> 26:44.733
Spa treatment, manicure,

26:44.777 --> 26:46.779
room service, French champagne,
and I just got a call,

26:46.822 --> 26:49.085
he's ordered
a limousine for tonight.

26:49.129 --> 26:51.697
Guess you haven't got the
bill for the flowers yet?

26:51.740 --> 26:52.611
[laughing]

26:54.525 --> 26:57.050
Just a little less break
in the front.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.791
TAILOR:
Mm-hmm.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.357
Ah, Junior.

27:00.401 --> 27:02.098
What do you think?

27:02.142 --> 27:05.493
[laughing]:
Oh, Dad.

27:05.536 --> 27:06.799
You look great.

27:06.842 --> 27:07.887
Could you excuse us?

27:07.930 --> 27:09.671
Certainly.
Just a moment,
Vincent.

27:09.715 --> 27:10.846
[chuckling]:
Thanks.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.066
Oh, gosh. Wow.

27:13.109 --> 27:14.676
Are you out of your mind?

27:14.720 --> 27:16.504
You don't bring a personal
tailor up to your room.

27:16.547 --> 27:19.942
Dad, come on!
This is a--

27:19.986 --> 27:22.815
Wow, that's soft.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.251
Pure cashmere.

27:24.294 --> 27:26.514
100% virgin.

27:26.557 --> 27:29.299
You rented a cashmere tuxedo?

27:29.343 --> 27:31.171
No, uh, bought it.

27:31.214 --> 27:33.695
At least, NCIS did.

27:33.739 --> 27:36.045
[laughing]:
NCIS...

27:36.089 --> 27:38.308
You're out of control.

27:38.352 --> 27:41.398
Are you here to brief me
on tonight's op?

27:41.442 --> 27:42.748
Hmm?

27:43.836 --> 27:45.272
Oh, no.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.230
You think you're
James Bond, don't you?

27:47.274 --> 27:48.623
Dad, there is no "op."

27:48.667 --> 27:50.320
Your job is
to get Ziva

27:50.364 --> 27:52.888
into the party, so
she can plant the bug.

27:52.932 --> 27:55.456
That's it. Then you stay
out of her way. Get it?

27:55.499 --> 27:57.588
Got it.
Good!

27:57.632 --> 28:01.636
What is your current
relationship with her?

28:01.680 --> 28:04.204
Ziva?

28:04.247 --> 28:06.772
We're coworkers.
We don't have a relationship.

28:06.815 --> 28:07.860
It's strictly business.

28:07.903 --> 28:10.427
Then you won't mind
if I make my move,

28:10.471 --> 28:13.474
if the opportunity
presents itself?

28:13.517 --> 28:14.518
Dad.

28:14.562 --> 28:15.650
What?

28:15.694 --> 28:17.086
Please. I beg you.

28:17.130 --> 28:19.567
Don't embarrass me.

28:24.659 --> 28:27.749
DUCKY: Cause of death
was cervical dislocation.

28:27.793 --> 28:31.013
All indications were
that it was barehanded.

28:31.057 --> 28:34.756
C-1 and C-2 were dislocated,
causing immediate asphyxia.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.105
Why aren't you
getting ready?

28:36.149 --> 28:37.759
Well, I got something
on Dan Mayfield.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.153
Well, I'll leave you two
to your detective work.

28:40.196 --> 28:41.981
Oh! I have, uh,

28:42.024 --> 28:44.418
two tickets to the
Norman Rockwell exhibit

28:44.461 --> 28:45.549
at the Smithsonian.

28:47.073 --> 28:49.597
No matter.

28:49.640 --> 28:50.772
Who is that?

28:50.816 --> 28:52.731
ZIVA:
Rachel Royce.

28:52.774 --> 28:53.819
Oh, his daughter.

28:53.862 --> 28:56.647
And not a fan of
Dan Mayfield.

28:56.691 --> 28:57.866
GIBBS:
Well, what'd you find out?

28:57.910 --> 28:59.346
ZIVA: A month ago,
she filed a lawsuit

28:59.389 --> 29:00.782
in a Swiss court.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.784
Her complaint is
that Mayfield

29:02.828 --> 29:05.352
has unlawfully denied
access to her father.

29:05.395 --> 29:06.788
Rachel Royce claims
that she has not

29:06.832 --> 29:09.791
seen him in four years or
spoken to him in three.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.010
That's not nice.

29:11.053 --> 29:12.925
No, it's not nice.
She blames Mayfield,

29:12.968 --> 29:14.796
and not her brother's
tragic death,

29:14.840 --> 29:16.798
for making Royce a recluse.
I've got calls

29:16.842 --> 29:18.800
in to Rachel
and her lawyer.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.976
If she's Royce's
sole beneficiary,

29:21.020 --> 29:23.413
then Mayfield's gonna be looking
for work as soon as Royce dies.

29:23.457 --> 29:25.415
I do hope he's got
a good retirement plan.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.156
That's good work.
Now, get going.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.114
Mm-hmm.
Go.

29:28.157 --> 29:29.028
Come on. Show time.

29:40.691 --> 29:42.563
Mmm!

29:42.606 --> 29:44.130
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

29:44.173 --> 29:45.392
Nutter Butter.

29:45.435 --> 29:47.307
This is surreal.

29:47.350 --> 29:50.919
I feel like I'm in a James Bond
movie directed by Fellini.

29:50.963 --> 29:54.314
On a stakeout, watching my
father and Ziva go undercover,

29:54.357 --> 29:56.925
while you munch orgasmically
on a Nutter Butter.

29:56.969 --> 29:59.754
ZIVA [over headset]:
We're approaching the house.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.887
All right, Ziva.
We read you loud and clear.

30:01.930 --> 30:04.672
You look ravishing,
"Sophia."

30:04.715 --> 30:05.847
[laughing]

30:05.891 --> 30:06.892
McGEE:
Oh! Oh!

30:06.935 --> 30:08.850
There it is!
ZIVA:
Uh-uh.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.765
This is the beginning
of the end of my career.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.564
Getting a solid image
off the spy-cam brooch.

30:31.612 --> 30:33.570
There's Dan Mayfield.

30:33.614 --> 30:37.139
Come on.
I'll introduce you to him.

30:44.712 --> 30:45.931
That the Royce vessel?

30:45.974 --> 30:46.932
Mm-hmm.

30:46.975 --> 30:48.150
In the Mediterranean.

30:48.194 --> 30:49.325
Real time
satellite image.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.066
It's 100 miles
southwest of Corsica.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.546
It's 0300 there.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.243
Supposedly looking
for minerals.

30:54.287 --> 30:55.723
It's 200 miles

30:55.766 --> 30:57.203
from where the military
lost radio contact

30:57.246 --> 30:59.814
with the B-47,
back in 1956.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.337
Well, could explain
why the search parties

31:01.381 --> 31:02.556
never found the wreckage.

31:02.599 --> 31:03.818
They were looking
in the wrong place.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.602
Well, I've notified
the Joint Chiefs.

31:05.646 --> 31:07.691
Several ships from the Sixth
Fleet have been put on alert.

31:07.735 --> 31:10.172
The Mark-15 weighs
7,600 pounds.

31:10.216 --> 31:11.695
Our analyst tells us that

31:11.739 --> 31:13.001
that ship's not equipped
to lift anything

31:13.045 --> 31:14.307
that heavy off
the sea floor.

31:14.350 --> 31:15.264
They've got
a submersible.

31:15.308 --> 31:16.875
They could have used it

31:16.918 --> 31:19.051
to remove the serial plate
to verify their find.

31:19.094 --> 31:21.183
We think they're waiting
for the equipment necessary

31:21.227 --> 31:22.793
to raise that bomb to arrive.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.926
How's this going?

31:24.970 --> 31:27.537
GIBBS: Well, Mayfield's list
justified our suspicions.

31:27.581 --> 31:28.974
We've already identified four

31:29.017 --> 31:30.410
international
arms dealers.

31:30.453 --> 31:31.672
And our people are
in the middle of it.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.110
Who is this?

31:35.154 --> 31:37.547
Got her, Ziva.

31:37.591 --> 31:40.986
Name is Julie Merriweather.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.335
President
of Merriweather Associates.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.598
It's a Beltway PR firm.

31:44.641 --> 31:47.166
So, you actually
live in New York?

31:47.209 --> 31:49.081
It's my base.

31:49.124 --> 31:50.952
McGEE [over comm]:
Ziva, who's that in the corner?

31:50.996 --> 31:52.171
Would you excuse me?

31:52.214 --> 31:55.783
Okay, darling.
I'll be right here.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.828
Hey, Tony, I think
you just got a glimpse

31:57.872 --> 31:59.178
of your next
stepmother.

31:59.221 --> 32:00.788
That's very funny, McGee.

32:00.831 --> 32:03.486
What's your relationship
with Sophia?

32:03.530 --> 32:05.706
We don't have
a relationship.

32:06.663 --> 32:09.057
It's strictly business.

32:09.101 --> 32:10.319
[laughs]

32:13.627 --> 32:17.587
Ziva, try to get
a clean view.

32:17.631 --> 32:19.720
No. Mayfield's blocking him.
Move to your left, Ziva.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.507
Good, good.

32:24.551 --> 32:25.987
Great. Got him.

32:33.603 --> 32:35.170
Agah Bayar.

32:35.214 --> 32:38.217
Turkish arms dealer.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.001
He's on the Interpol's
watch list.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.524
Tomorrow, when the others break
into groups,

32:41.568 --> 32:43.352
you and I will get a chance
to talk alone.

32:43.396 --> 32:44.266
BAYAR:
Sure.

32:49.402 --> 32:52.231
She's very beautiful,
isn't she?

32:52.274 --> 32:55.103
Yes... she is.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.584
She's with an old acquaintance
of Jonathon Royce.

32:57.627 --> 33:00.195
Great party.

33:00.239 --> 33:01.631
You know who she is.

33:01.675 --> 33:02.937
Don't you?

33:02.981 --> 33:04.243
Her name's Sophia.

33:04.286 --> 33:07.333
No. I believe her name's Ziva.

33:09.335 --> 33:13.687
She's the daughter of Eli David,
Director of the Israeli Mossad.

33:13.730 --> 33:16.124
It is known that
she is now a

33:16.168 --> 33:18.213
U.S. federal agent.

33:18.257 --> 33:19.954
Are you sure?

33:22.174 --> 33:24.045
TONY:
Uh-oh.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.351
Push in.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.268
What's this all about?

33:29.311 --> 33:31.052
Doesn't look good.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.584
[sighs]

33:41.628 --> 33:43.717
McGEE:
Ziva, give me a 20 on Gaston.

33:43.760 --> 33:47.199
He's not in the room.

33:47.242 --> 33:50.202
While I'm interested
in your proposition,

33:50.245 --> 33:52.987
I'm not interested in spending
the rest of my life

33:53.031 --> 33:54.423
in an American prison.

33:57.165 --> 33:59.211
Good-bye.

34:02.214 --> 34:03.606
McGEE:
Bayar's on the move.

34:03.650 --> 34:06.435
Keep smiling, Ziva.

34:06.479 --> 34:08.829
I'm telling you,
I don't like this.

34:18.404 --> 34:20.145
Hi, hi.
Hi.

34:20.188 --> 34:21.363
What's going on in there?

34:21.407 --> 34:23.191
What do you got, Abbs?

34:23.235 --> 34:25.498
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

34:25.541 --> 34:27.456
to run an international
DNA search?

34:27.500 --> 34:29.676
I mean, Interpol
has 179 member states,

34:29.719 --> 34:32.200
all of which need answers to
their inquiries immediately.Abby...

34:32.244 --> 34:34.115
Remember Fiona,
the genetic scientist

34:34.159 --> 34:35.682
from Liechtenstein
I became pen pals with?

34:35.725 --> 34:38.728
Well, her cousin works
for Interpol.Yeah, I remember.

34:38.772 --> 34:40.904
And he ran the DNA
from underneath our victim's

34:40.948 --> 34:42.384
fingernails for me.
Got a hit.

34:42.428 --> 34:44.865
Theo Gaston,
head of Royce's security.

34:44.908 --> 34:47.955
He used to be
a Swiss Grenadier, and...

34:47.998 --> 34:51.611
he taught hand-to-hand combat
for the elite special forces.

34:56.877 --> 34:58.444
What's going on?

34:58.487 --> 35:00.924
GIBBS: DiNozzo, time to get
your father out of the house.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.622
Tell Ziva to keep Gaston
under surveillance.

35:02.665 --> 35:03.840
We got

35:03.884 --> 35:05.407
DNA evidence
that ties him to the murder.

35:05.451 --> 35:06.582
Got it, boss.

35:06.626 --> 35:08.584
Gaston takes his
orders from Mayfield.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.586
We got enough to
bring them both in.

35:10.630 --> 35:11.544
Ziva, pull out.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.067
ZIVA:
Just a few more minutes.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.677
I have not planted
the bug yet.

35:14.721 --> 35:16.244
Get my father out of there!

35:16.288 --> 35:17.898
He is fine, Tony.

35:17.941 --> 35:18.725
Gibbs' order.

35:18.768 --> 35:20.727
Gaston's the killer.

35:20.770 --> 35:22.816
We're leaving.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.557
No, no, no, not... not yet.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.168
The, uh, president
of the World Bank just arrived.

35:27.212 --> 35:28.343
The chance of a lifetime.

35:28.387 --> 35:29.866
I'll only need a few minutes
with him.

35:29.910 --> 35:32.782
This is not a request,
it is an order. Move.

35:34.044 --> 35:35.176
The World Bank.

35:36.699 --> 35:39.137
TONY SR.: Hello, Heinrich.
How's the finance world?

35:39.180 --> 35:40.747
Oh, Dad, shut up.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.449
Going somewhere,
Agent David?

35:48.798 --> 35:49.930
Uh-oh.

35:49.973 --> 35:52.324
Theo, great party.

35:52.367 --> 35:54.674
Really appreciate
the invite and, uh,

35:54.717 --> 35:56.197
the plane ride, but, uh,

35:56.241 --> 35:57.981
I'm not feeling too well.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.940
Just get out of there.

35:59.983 --> 36:01.985
Maybe I had a little
too much to drink.

36:06.207 --> 36:07.208
Boss, we're on the move.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.297
Does Agent David
carry a weapon?

36:09.341 --> 36:11.386
She isa weapon.

36:11.430 --> 36:12.953
I need you both
to come with me.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.694
We're leaving.

36:16.522 --> 36:18.350
[Ziva grunts]

36:23.746 --> 36:26.880
You're going to have to go
through me, Dan.

36:26.923 --> 36:28.621
What are you going
to do, old man?

36:31.580 --> 36:33.626
[grunts]
[grunts]

36:34.757 --> 36:36.150
[sighs]

36:36.194 --> 36:37.717
[laughs]

36:40.328 --> 36:41.286
Junior!

36:41.329 --> 36:42.939
Can I borrow your handcuffs?

36:44.637 --> 36:47.030
Come on! Junior!

36:51.296 --> 36:53.907
REPORTER:
In the Mediterranean Sea,
off the coast of Corsica,

36:53.950 --> 36:56.126
ships of the U.S.
Sixth Fleet have come

36:56.170 --> 36:58.041
to the aid
of the Global Seeker,

36:58.085 --> 36:59.565
a deep-sea mining vessel owned

36:59.608 --> 37:01.915
by the reclusive billionaire
Jonathon Royce.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.438
The Navy has responded

37:03.482 --> 37:05.832
to a distress call received
from the ship's captain.

37:05.875 --> 37:09.183
Media's going
with the cover story.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.272
Our agents found documents
on the ship

37:11.316 --> 37:13.231
confirming Mayfield
had knowledge of the bomb.

37:13.274 --> 37:15.276
Is he talking?Well, sure.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.844
He's not copping
to a murder yet.

37:17.887 --> 37:19.976
Threw his security chief
underneath the bus, claims that

37:20.020 --> 37:22.675
he told Gaston only
to follow Iverson, not kill him.

37:22.718 --> 37:24.894
They were afraid he was going
to talk to Admiral Chase.

37:24.938 --> 37:27.723
Well, authorities in Switzerland
gained access to the chalet.

37:27.767 --> 37:31.336
They found Jonathon Royce
comatose, on life support.

37:31.379 --> 37:32.902
The attending physician

37:32.946 --> 37:34.817
wanted to pull the plug
months ago,

37:34.861 --> 37:37.255
but was ordered by Dan Mayfield
to keep Royce alive.

37:37.298 --> 37:38.517
Well, it makes sense.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.127
Mayfield knew
that if Royce dies,

37:40.170 --> 37:41.694
he's out of a job.

37:41.737 --> 37:44.044
Selling the nuke was going
to be his golden parachute.

37:44.087 --> 37:46.873
Director, gentlemen,

37:46.916 --> 37:48.353
I have a serious problem
with Anthony DiNozzo.

37:48.396 --> 37:49.528
What?

37:49.571 --> 37:51.530
He's absolutely
out of control.

37:51.573 --> 37:52.531
Senior.

37:52.574 --> 37:54.402
In the last two days,

37:54.446 --> 37:57.579
he's run up nearly $9,000
in expenses.

37:57.623 --> 37:59.581
What do you suggest
I do?
Pay 'em.

37:59.625 --> 38:01.017
He's worth every penny.

38:01.061 --> 38:02.802
What exactly did he do?

38:06.588 --> 38:08.547
That's classified.

38:11.419 --> 38:12.681
See you later, Fred.

38:12.725 --> 38:15.554
So, are you actually
leaving this time?

38:15.597 --> 38:17.207
TONY SR.:
I have to, Abby.

38:17.251 --> 38:18.774
I asked the director
about joining

38:18.818 --> 38:21.299
the agency, but apparently,
there's an age limit.

38:21.342 --> 38:24.345
But he, uh,
did give me a cap.

38:24.389 --> 38:25.955
ZIVA:
Well, it looks

38:25.999 --> 38:27.087
great on you.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.175
Good-bye.

38:28.218 --> 38:30.177
Bye.

38:30.220 --> 38:31.787
Mmm.

38:31.831 --> 38:32.962
[rapturous sigh]

38:33.006 --> 38:34.399
[laughs]

38:36.966 --> 38:38.620
Bye.

38:39.969 --> 38:40.709
Junior!

38:42.189 --> 38:44.234
Right behind you, Dad.

38:44.278 --> 38:46.846
I'd appreciate if you didn't
call me Junior at work. Thanks.

38:53.287 --> 38:54.549
I'll just get my stuff.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.464
Okay.

39:00.990 --> 39:02.949
Okay.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.342
Wait a second.

39:04.385 --> 39:06.605
You're taking the tux?

39:06.648 --> 39:08.955
What's NCIS going
to do with it?

39:08.998 --> 39:10.565
[scoffs]

39:10.609 --> 39:13.176
What is it, Junior?

39:13.220 --> 39:16.049
You've been acting
strange all day.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.485
[clears throat]

39:17.529 --> 39:19.444
Something I got to
talk to you about.

39:23.926 --> 39:25.885
Are you all right?

39:25.928 --> 39:28.235
You're not, uh,
sick, are you?

39:28.278 --> 39:31.064
No. No, listen...

39:31.107 --> 39:32.195
Yeah.

39:32.239 --> 39:34.807
Can we sit?

39:36.243 --> 39:38.593
[clears throat]

39:38.637 --> 39:40.595
This is serious,
isn't it?

39:40.639 --> 39:43.119
Well, look, I don't want
to make it any bigger

39:43.163 --> 39:45.208
than it is, but you know, I...

39:45.252 --> 39:47.428
You can't judge
a book by its cover,

39:47.472 --> 39:49.299
and things are,
you know, uh...

39:49.343 --> 39:52.041
aren't always what
they appear to be,

39:52.085 --> 39:54.609
but, um...

39:54.653 --> 39:57.395
This is about
me being broke?

39:57.438 --> 39:59.266
Yes.

40:01.442 --> 40:04.010
This is not a big deal.

40:04.053 --> 40:05.664
It's happened before.

40:07.448 --> 40:09.972
When you were in your second
year at boarding school,

40:10.016 --> 40:11.713
I filed for
bankruptcy.

40:11.757 --> 40:13.149
I'll bounce back.

40:13.193 --> 40:15.108
I always do.

40:15.151 --> 40:17.589
You knew about it last
year when you bought me

40:17.632 --> 40:19.591
the ticket to
Monte Carlo.

40:19.634 --> 40:21.636
Well, how did you find out
about that?

40:21.680 --> 40:23.464
When I caught up
with Prince Al.

40:23.508 --> 40:25.510
He didn't know
anything about it.

40:25.553 --> 40:27.425
You didn't say anything.

40:27.468 --> 40:29.688
I appreciate it.

40:29.731 --> 40:32.168
Well, Dad... [laughs]

40:32.212 --> 40:34.040
I didn't know what to say.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.564
We're DiNozzos.

40:36.608 --> 40:38.653
We don't communicate well.

40:38.697 --> 40:40.699
Hmm.

40:40.742 --> 40:42.744
We used to, you know.

40:42.788 --> 40:44.877
A long time ago.

40:44.920 --> 40:48.663
Sometimes I wish we could
rewind to the last time

40:48.707 --> 40:51.361
we had a normal
father-son relationship.

40:51.405 --> 40:54.974
When was that?

40:55.017 --> 40:56.976
It was a fishing trip.

40:57.019 --> 40:58.499
It was just before Mom died.

40:58.543 --> 40:59.979
You probably don't remember.

41:03.199 --> 41:04.810
[sighs]

41:07.160 --> 41:09.249
Dad, it's... it's okay.

41:09.292 --> 41:10.642
I mean, I...

41:22.915 --> 41:26.832
I look at that picture
every morning.

41:26.875 --> 41:30.183
It's one of my
fondest memories, too.

41:38.191 --> 41:40.149
Okay.

41:40.193 --> 41:43.675
From now on, we talk, hmm?

41:43.718 --> 41:46.242
Now...

41:46.286 --> 41:49.158
let's get out of here before
we both start bawling, huh?

41:49.202 --> 41:50.986
[laughs]

41:51.030 --> 41:52.379
All right, well,
I'm taking you

41:52.422 --> 41:54.337
to the train station,
and I'm buying you a ticket.

41:54.381 --> 41:55.774
No.

41:55.817 --> 41:57.776
You are taking me
to the airport.

41:57.819 --> 42:01.040
I bumped into Donald Trump
down in the lobby this morning.

42:01.083 --> 42:03.825
You get me
to Reagan by noon,

42:03.869 --> 42:06.393
I'm flying home in style.

42:08.395 --> 42:10.005
Can you get my
bag, Junior?
