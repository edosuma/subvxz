01:56.199 --> 01:58.110
Lights out!

02:20.724 --> 02:23.091
<i>--struggle which followed
the death of Lenin...</i>

02:23.268 --> 02:25.509
<i>...Joseph Stalin prevailed.</i>

02:25.687 --> 02:30.397
<i>Stalin was the new face
of an old idea: Marxism.</i>

02:30.567 --> 02:33.935
<i>While the Bolsheviks firmly established
their authority at home...</i>

02:34.655 --> 02:37.943
<i>...the Comintern fomented revolution
throughout the world.</i>

02:38.533 --> 02:40.774
<i>Communism was on the march.</i>

02:40.952 --> 02:43.193
<i>Stalin was in the Kremlin.</i>

02:43.372 --> 02:45.113
<i>But what of the common people?</i>

02:45.290 --> 02:46.951
<i>What of the proletariat?</i>

02:47.125 --> 02:50.288
<i>Those who fought to win a new world?</i>

02:51.463 --> 02:53.374
<i>If we look at the history...</i>

02:57.678 --> 02:59.294
They're frying someone, Pop.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.428
You're on the Hades Express, mister.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.009
Quiet.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.641
Death is nothing to celebrate.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.974
- Don't matter who it is.
- He just died.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.808
His name was Wayne Fisher.

03:10.982 --> 03:15.226
He was <i>32</i> years old,
and he killed a lady with a hammer.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.688
He had a rib eye for his last meal.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.653
He's been on death row
at Dewbend for three years.

03:23.161 --> 03:27.075
- And his last words were, "Go to hell."
- How do you know that?

03:27.249 --> 03:28.330
It's just in my head.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.038
All right.
It's past your bedtime, children.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.249
Go brush your teeth
and go to bed, please.

03:34.423 --> 03:37.916
<i>And history always repeats, my friends.</i>

03:38.093 --> 03:41.336
<i>The ghosts of their past
will soon become our present...</i>

03:41.513 --> 03:44.130
<i>...if we do not confront them head-on.</i>

03:53.400 --> 03:56.893
Elise, I thought I told you
to put all these toys away.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.691
You're not listening to me.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.902
It wasn't me who made this mess.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.440
Then who was it?

04:07.289 --> 04:09.951
Christian, shut the door, please.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.536
You can tell me.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.466
It was the little boy.

04:21.636 --> 04:25.129
He lived here a long time ago,
and he loves playing with our toys.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.969
- I swear.
- I believe you.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.224
I do.

04:30.270 --> 04:34.104
You know,
you've been blessed with a gift.

04:34.816 --> 04:35.851
You're special.

04:36.443 --> 04:39.060
Some people are afraid of special people.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.646
Your daddy, he's one of them.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.783
He doesn't understand your gift.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.950
You just keep it between us
from now on, okay?

04:51.666 --> 04:53.156
Okay.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.879
It's time for bed.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.341
- Good night.
- Don't turn off the light, Mom.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.726
I'm gonna be right out there, honey.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.558
And if you ever get scared,
what do you do?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.015
That's right.

05:18.193 --> 05:22.357
I gave you this,
so that if you ever get scared, you can go:

05:24.658 --> 05:27.366
Wherever I am, I'll come running.
But you gotta save it...

05:27.536 --> 05:30.699
- ...for when you really need me, okay?
- Okay.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.952
I love you both so much.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.743
- Love you too, Mommy.
- Love you, Mommy.

05:46.513 --> 05:49.096
<i>We see an actual atomic bombing run.</i>

05:49.266 --> 05:52.679
<i>Heading for the target is Backseat,
code name for the ship.</i>

05:52.853 --> 05:53.888
<i>The radio navigator...</i>

05:55.397 --> 05:56.603
Hey.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.059
What?

05:58.233 --> 06:00.315
You asleep yet?

06:00.485 --> 06:02.067
No.

06:04.114 --> 06:08.028
Do you ever think about the people
who go to the electric chair?

06:09.661 --> 06:12.073
Sometimes.

06:14.374 --> 06:18.709
Do you wonder where they go
after it's done?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.335
No.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.422
I know where they go.

06:23.592 --> 06:25.253
Oh, yeah?

06:25.427 --> 06:26.917
Where?

06:29.764 --> 06:33.223
They go into the dark.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.033
Christian?

07:33.078 --> 07:34.944
What are you doing?

08:03.191 --> 08:04.898
Elise.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.580
You made all the mess, didn't you?

08:26.881 --> 08:28.212
Yes.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.470
Where's my whistle?

08:37.142 --> 08:38.724
The boy is in the closet.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.135
It's okay.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.644
We won't hurt you.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.564
Come on out.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.976
Stop it, Elise.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.145
Come on out.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.949
I'm not in the closet.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.833
<i>The people took their revenge.</i>

09:06.880 --> 09:08.746
Gerald. Gerald, no.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.381
What have you done, Elise?

09:13.636 --> 09:15.752
- Put your hands on the wall.
- Leave her alone.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.261
Quiet, Audrey!

09:24.939 --> 09:26.395
Did you see a ghost?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.227
Gerald, stop it.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.891
Yes.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.736
I don't want to hurt you, girl.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.902
Just say no. That's all you have to do.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.287
I'm just gonna ask you again.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.161
Did you see a ghost?

09:45.335 --> 09:46.370
Yes, I did.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.294
They're all around us in this house.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.830
They're everywhere.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.042
You don't have to do this. Please.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.507
She's just a little girl, Gerald. Please.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.092
No. No, Daddy.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.381
No, no.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.435
No, no, no. Take me. Please take me.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.643
- Help me.
- Please, please, please. Gerald, stop!

10:08.817 --> 10:11.104
- Please, honey, she's had enough.
- Don't. Stop.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.642
Please don't. No.

10:12.821 --> 10:15.939
Don't tell me how to punish her.
I punish people for a living.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.277
Please!

10:17.450 --> 10:18.861
Please, not in there.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.151
No, no, no.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.946
No, Daddy!

10:24.124 --> 10:26.786
No. Daddy, please,
I don't wanna go in there!

10:26.960 --> 10:28.997
No, not in there.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.628
No, Daddy, please, not in there!

10:31.798 --> 10:34.256
Daddy, let me out! Daddy, please!

10:34.425 --> 10:36.007
You can either follow my rules...

10:36.177 --> 10:39.386
...and sleep under my roof or you can
break them and sleep under my floor.

10:39.556 --> 10:40.967
Don't put me in here, Daddy.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.347
Daddy, please.

10:42.517 --> 10:45.805
Daddy, come back.
I don't wanna be in here alone.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.186
Daddy, please!

12:11.731 --> 12:14.974
Are you scared of the dark?

12:15.401 --> 12:18.484
Who is that? Who's there?

12:23.785 --> 12:25.492
Don't be afraid.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.120
I can make it light.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.431
Who is that?

12:53.564 --> 12:55.225
Why are you down here?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.562
My daddy put me down here.

12:57.735 --> 13:01.353
Your daddy doesn't treat you right.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.113
Open this door.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.695
There'll be lots of light.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.076
Go on. Open it.

13:09.247 --> 13:12.706
There's a key hanging up right there.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.660
Take your time. I can wait.

13:15.837 --> 13:19.501
You're the only one
that can open the door.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.962
You are more powerful than you know.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.925
I want you to help me open all the doors.

14:42.340 --> 14:46.254
<i>Don't forget what Bill the turtle just did,
everyone...</i>

14:46.427 --> 14:49.590
<i>...because we might have to do
the same thing.</i>

14:49.764 --> 14:52.256
<i>That's what this is all about, my friends.</i>

14:52.433 --> 14:54.094
<i>Duck and cover.</i>

14:54.644 --> 14:56.601
<i>This is an official civil defense film...</i>

14:56.771 --> 14:59.103
<i>...produced in cooperation
with the Federal Civil...</i>

15:05.988 --> 15:07.444
Elise?

15:14.038 --> 15:15.494
<i>...for the ultimate...</i>

15:28.761 --> 15:30.547
Elise?

15:44.652 --> 15:45.767
Audrey?

15:48.239 --> 15:49.900
Audrey.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.195
Audrey!

15:53.369 --> 15:55.781
No, no, Audrey. Audrey, no.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.913
No. No. No.

16:01.419 --> 16:02.705
No, Audrey!

16:02.879 --> 16:04.620
I'm sorry.

16:05.882 --> 16:09.216
No!

17:04.857 --> 17:06.473
Good morning.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.063
The dreams are coming back, Warren.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.737
Just won't go away, will it?

17:12.906 --> 17:16.275
How would you like breakfast in bed?

17:16.868 --> 17:18.859
I thought so.

17:19.038 --> 17:23.498
- You're getting old, Warren. We both are.
- I've been studying last week's footage...

17:23.667 --> 17:27.127
...from the church. We missed something.
There is movement in the frame.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.663
- Look.
- It's a piece of lint.

17:31.133 --> 17:34.797
- Lint doesn't walk across the room.
- Behold.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.255
The reason I was up all night.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.549
The lights.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.728
That's right, my friends.
It's voice activated.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.357
No more dealing with pesky switches,
having to find them in the dark...

17:49.527 --> 17:51.564
...straining fingers as you switch them.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.944
Yeah, that was a real problem before,
you know.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.402
Toil in the darkness of sarcasm,
my friend.

17:56.576 --> 18:01.161
I prefer to work in the lights.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.075
The lights?

18:07.670 --> 18:09.627
Lights!

18:13.467 --> 18:14.502
Bad acoustics.

18:14.677 --> 18:18.966
Natural light's better
for the environment anyway. Voila.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.381
I love that you boys are staying
in the house.

18:21.559 --> 18:25.302
But please don't try to fix anything else
that isn't broken.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.558
Spectral Sightings.

18:32.737 --> 18:33.977
Yes, she is.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.611
Elise!

18:36.574 --> 18:39.783
- This is Elise.
<i>- Hey there. My name is Ted Garza.</i>

18:39.952 --> 18:41.909
Nice to meet you, Mr. Garza.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.616
<i>Yeah. I'm having some problems.</i>

18:44.790 --> 18:46.906
<i>Things are happening in my house...</i>

18:47.084 --> 18:49.872
<i>...and they say
that you know about this stuff.</i>

18:50.046 --> 18:51.457
I know some things.

18:51.631 --> 18:55.090
<i>Yeah, well, I was wondering
if you could take a look.</i>

18:55.259 --> 18:59.844
<i>I need... I need help is the thing, see.</i>

19:00.014 --> 19:01.504
May I ask where you live?

19:01.682 --> 19:06.267
<i>I live at 414 Appletree Road...</i>

19:07.229 --> 19:09.345
<i>...Five Keys, New Mexico.</i>

19:19.158 --> 19:21.069
Mr. Garza...

19:21.619 --> 19:24.782
...I wish I could help you,
but I really can't.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.696
I'm so sorry.

19:26.874 --> 19:30.037
I thank you very much
for thinking of me.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.403
Sorry to drag you boys out of bed.

19:58.948 --> 20:02.157
That man who called today about a job...

20:05.287 --> 20:09.201
...he told me he lives in the house
that I grew up in.

20:10.668 --> 20:14.252
I call it a house because it wasn't a...
A home.

20:20.428 --> 20:24.513
I don't have memories from that place.
I have scars.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.889
This gift I have
that you boys are so in awe of...

20:32.523 --> 20:35.265
...my father tried to beat it out of me.

20:37.445 --> 20:38.901
And...

20:39.447 --> 20:40.608
...my mother...

20:41.490 --> 20:43.697
...she was killed in that house.

20:43.868 --> 20:47.862
She was murdered by something
that I brought into this world.

20:48.497 --> 20:51.740
This demon wants to use my abilities...

20:51.917 --> 20:54.329
...and it will hurt the ones I love
to get to me.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.995
That's why I never want to go
into The Further...

20:57.173 --> 20:59.255
...like I did for Quinn.

20:59.425 --> 21:03.168
I have spent my life fighting
these things...

21:03.345 --> 21:07.088
...because I can never forget the look
on my mother's face when she died.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.766
So...

21:12.104 --> 21:14.436
...I have to help this man...

21:15.649 --> 21:18.562
...because I know what he's up against.

21:19.987 --> 21:23.275
We'll pack up the truck tonight.
We'll get an early start tomorrow.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.190
Not this time.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.572
This one, I have to do...

21:29.413 --> 21:30.949
...alone.

22:15.668 --> 22:19.662
We have to come with you now.
This cost us 700 bucks.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.797
Plus 200 for the logo paint job.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.145
Before we go inside...

24:05.319 --> 24:07.686
...I brought some clothes for you boys.

24:09.406 --> 24:13.525
Some of it belonged to Jack,
and it's very important to me.

24:16.330 --> 24:18.412
I bet I can guess who you are.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.789
There's no need. I'm Elise.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.084
- Hi.
- And this is Specs and Tucker...

24:23.253 --> 24:24.584
...my associates.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.587
She's psychic.

24:26.757 --> 24:28.873
We're sidekick.

24:29.343 --> 24:30.799
What was that?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.962
She's psychic. We're sidekick.

24:35.516 --> 24:39.009
- Sorry, I'm... I'm not understanding.
- Yeah, never mind.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.053
You wanna come in? Here.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.893
Come on. I'm supposed
to invite you in. Come on.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.149
Hello.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.198
<i>--aggression.</i>

24:58.372 --> 25:01.364
<i>And history always repeats, my friends.</i>

25:01.542 --> 25:04.876
<i>The ghosts of their past
will soon become our present...</i>

25:05.045 --> 25:06.661
<i>...if we do not confront them...</i>

25:06.839 --> 25:08.876
You still have so much of our old stuff.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.006
It was all here.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.426
Pretty good stuff, you know?

25:14.596 --> 25:16.678
I didn't see any reason to get rid of it.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.386
There's stories.

25:20.561 --> 25:21.972
About your family.

25:22.146 --> 25:24.763
I never listened to them
when they said that...

25:24.940 --> 25:27.272
...this wasn't a place that I should live.

25:27.443 --> 25:30.401
You know, I looked at it,
and I just saw a little house.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.818
I said, "Screw the stories,"
and I bought it.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.657
Now I believe the stories.

25:46.462 --> 25:48.248
You getting anything?

25:49.006 --> 25:52.624
There are so many spirits,
it's hard to tell the good from the evil.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.634
A lot of people died in that prison.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.590
When did these occurrences start?

25:57.765 --> 26:00.132
Soon after I moved in.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.477
First, it was...

26:05.647 --> 26:07.729
...the little things, you know?

26:08.192 --> 26:09.557
Things that...

26:13.363 --> 26:16.151
<i>You've been blessed with a gift.</i>

26:32.883 --> 26:34.920
<i>You're special.</i>

26:35.344 --> 26:38.336
<i>You just keep it between us
from now on, okay?</i>

26:39.223 --> 26:41.965
<i>No. No!</i>

26:44.603 --> 26:45.934
You okay?

26:49.441 --> 26:51.933
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

26:52.861 --> 26:55.023
These experiences you're having...

26:55.197 --> 26:56.904
...where do they mainly occur?

26:58.867 --> 27:01.199
Mostly in one room.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.578
I keep it locked now.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.536
I haven't opened it in three months.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.380
I'll take that one.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.708
You wanna give me a hand?

27:18.303 --> 27:19.885
That's good.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.798
A little bit more.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.286
Sorry.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.374
Can't go in there.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.597
When it first started...

28:09.479 --> 28:13.188
...I could hear somebody
just walking back and forth.

28:13.650 --> 28:17.018
Someone was talking to themselves.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.706
You think you're going crazy,
and then you...

28:30.876 --> 28:33.163
You actually hear it.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.417
And you know you're not.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.716
Finally, one day, I walked in...

28:40.886 --> 28:43.002
...and I screamed at it:

28:43.472 --> 28:45.258
"You stop."

28:47.100 --> 28:49.182
"You stop.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.681
Please stop."

28:53.815 --> 28:56.352
My whole life savings is in this place.

28:56.526 --> 28:58.108
You gotta help me.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.939
You gotta help me, please.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.779
That's what we do.

29:06.495 --> 29:10.113
The camera is so we can see
what she sees from out in the truck.

29:11.291 --> 29:14.033
We call it the "Winneba-ghost."

29:19.132 --> 29:21.999
I think I'm gonna go there now.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.475
You really are gonna stay here all alone?

29:35.649 --> 29:41.190
My presence tends to draw the spirits
out of their dark, little corners.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.402
You need to take this.

29:47.077 --> 29:48.693
Thank you.

29:49.997 --> 29:51.112
Good night.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.056
Can you hear us, Elise?

30:16.606 --> 30:20.600
Yes. Try not to drown out
the other voices.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.189
<i>We got you. We gone.</i>

30:24.948 --> 30:26.109
Here you go.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.400
- What's this?
- Lights.

30:30.871 --> 30:32.236
Thanks.

31:52.536 --> 31:55.028
I thought you were gone forever.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.289
<i>My mother got this for my brother...</i>

31:59.459 --> 32:02.747
...and he lost it
when he was 6 years old.

32:12.389 --> 32:14.175
Safe now.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.231
- Stop.
- What?

34:33.405 --> 34:34.735
Go back, to the left.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.530
- What?
- Yeah, nothing.

34:40.704 --> 34:42.695
Thought I saw some feet.

34:42.871 --> 34:44.033
Feet?

35:09.482 --> 35:12.520
Elise, there's someone
right in front of you.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.062
<i>Looks like a woman.</i>

35:16.239 --> 35:17.775
I don't see anything.

35:18.783 --> 35:21.571
<i>Elise, be careful.</i>

35:27.542 --> 35:29.829
I don't see what you're seeing.

35:32.047 --> 35:35.381
<i>You're going to touch it.</i>

35:36.551 --> 35:37.551
Be careful.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.137
Help her.

35:47.771 --> 35:50.809
Elise? Elise? What happened?

35:52.067 --> 35:53.557
The whistle.

35:53.735 --> 35:55.772
It took the whistle.

35:55.945 --> 35:58.277
What were you doing in there?

35:58.448 --> 36:01.110
Thought you were gonna stay
in the bedroom.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.116
Something led me down there.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.118
The spirit of a woman.

36:05.538 --> 36:09.623
I don't know why she said, "Help her,"
but it's a ghost I have seen before...

36:10.126 --> 36:11.742
...in this house.

36:13.463 --> 36:16.296
When I was 16 years old.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.320
Did you hear that?

36:40.490 --> 36:41.651
Hear what?

36:41.825 --> 36:44.442
There's someone in the laundry room.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.109
No, there isn't.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.327
I heard it.

36:48.498 --> 36:49.829
I'm gonna go look.

36:49.999 --> 36:52.582
No. Don't, Elise.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.336
Hello.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.048
I live here with my brother, Christian.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.714
- What's your name?
- Stop it.

37:07.142 --> 37:08.758
You're making it up.

37:09.769 --> 37:13.103
Come out and see my brother.
He doesn't believe that you're here.

37:13.273 --> 37:14.763
Christian!

37:21.364 --> 37:23.105
What are you doing, girl?

37:23.533 --> 37:25.820
There's someone in the laundry.

37:36.337 --> 37:37.543
There's no one in here.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.833
You're doing it again.

37:45.722 --> 37:49.511
You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it. I never asked for it.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.057
If there's one thing...

37:54.689 --> 37:57.681
...you've been doing
your whole life, Elise...

37:57.859 --> 37:59.099
...it's ask for it.

38:10.705 --> 38:13.663
I won't let you hurt me anymore.

38:17.879 --> 38:18.994
Please!

38:19.672 --> 38:21.504
Elise.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.173
Elise!

38:27.514 --> 38:29.130
Elise, don't go!

38:31.351 --> 38:34.810
Leave her be. Leave her be.

38:35.480 --> 38:39.895
She needs to learn that nobody else
can possibly love someone like her.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.448
I haven't been back here since.

38:58.211 --> 39:00.794
I think that's all for tonight.

39:00.964 --> 39:02.830
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

39:07.303 --> 39:10.295
Christian and I came here a lot as kids.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.631
Do I look okay?

39:12.809 --> 39:14.516
Yeah, of course.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.561
All right.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.240
I'm sorry. I...

39:38.418 --> 39:40.955
You just look so much
like someone I know very well.

39:41.129 --> 39:42.745
Oh, really?

39:43.673 --> 39:44.708
I'm Elise.

39:44.883 --> 39:45.998
Melissa.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.336
Imogen.

39:47.510 --> 39:50.218
- And you're sisters.
- Yes, we are.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.004
Tucker.

39:52.181 --> 39:53.717
Specs.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.258
I'm Specs. Or Steven.

39:56.436 --> 39:57.676
Whatever. Your choice.

39:57.854 --> 40:00.016
She's psychic, and we're sidekick.

40:00.690 --> 40:01.930
I'm sorry?

40:03.151 --> 40:04.607
Forget it.

40:04.777 --> 40:07.565
- So are you guys visiting the area?
- Tough to talk about.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.606
Actually, it's pretty <i>confidencial.</i>

40:10.783 --> 40:13.571
It's a poltergeist infestation
involving Ted Garza.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.282
Do you know him?
He lives, like, down the road or...?

40:16.456 --> 40:18.914
Ghosts and ghouls.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.245
What he's trying to say
is we're ghost hunters.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.126
The three of us.

40:23.296 --> 40:24.832
Kind of like cops.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.997
Only we don't arrest humans.

40:28.718 --> 40:30.755
I'm funny too. A lot of the time.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.966
- I can also be funny. What?
- Okay. Okay.

40:33.139 --> 40:35.301
- I think that that's enough, boys.
- Oh, yeah?

40:36.809 --> 40:40.222
I used to live in this town
a long time ago.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.603
Well, good for you. You got out.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.642
I'm really making a fool out of myself.
We're making...

40:46.819 --> 40:48.309
No, you're not.

40:48.488 --> 40:51.105
It's really nice to meet you.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.990
- Ernie, how's it hanging?
- Dad, over here.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.738
- How are you?
- Hot enough for you?

41:07.674 --> 41:08.960
Hello, Christian.

41:10.593 --> 41:12.083
Have I aged that much?

41:16.516 --> 41:19.099
Well, aren't you gonna say anything?

41:19.268 --> 41:20.804
I have nothing to say to you.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.344
Girls, come on. Let's go.

41:22.522 --> 41:23.808
- Come on.
- We just got here.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.893
Hear me out.

41:26.067 --> 41:28.900
I'm... I'm still your sister, and...

41:29.070 --> 41:33.109
That only means something if I choose it
to mean something, and I choose it not to.

41:33.282 --> 41:34.738
Please, Christian.

41:34.909 --> 41:38.118
I just want you to hear my piece.
I didn't know how this was gonna go.

41:38.287 --> 41:41.075
- I thought you could see the future.
- Is this your sister?

41:41.249 --> 41:43.707
- No, it isn't! Come on.
- Yes, yes, I am his sister.

41:43.876 --> 41:45.241
Listen to me. You listen.

41:45.420 --> 41:49.630
Now, when we were children,
you terrified me.

41:49.799 --> 41:52.461
You scared the life out of me...

41:52.635 --> 41:55.468
...with stories about a monster
behind a red door...

41:55.638 --> 41:58.551
...and then you opened the door
and you left.

41:58.725 --> 42:00.307
You left me.

42:00.476 --> 42:03.685
You abandoned me to a real monster,
our father.

42:04.647 --> 42:09.232
Look, I wish you no harm,
but you stay away from us, Elise.

42:09.402 --> 42:11.109
You stay away.

42:12.280 --> 42:13.770
Christian.

42:20.955 --> 42:24.619
Christian!

42:32.050 --> 42:34.337
I was stupid to come back here.

42:34.510 --> 42:36.501
No, you weren't. You're helping people.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.511
That's what you do, remember?

42:38.681 --> 42:40.388
Elise.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.299
I'm sorry.

42:42.477 --> 42:45.014
He can be unreasonable sometimes.

42:45.438 --> 42:48.772
Knowing what he grew up with,
that's perfectly understandable.

42:48.941 --> 42:51.273
He's never told us anything
about his childhood.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.485
I've never even seen a picture.

42:53.654 --> 42:56.646
He never told us anything about you.

42:57.533 --> 43:01.948
I left him alone, and I shouldn't have.

43:02.121 --> 43:04.954
He is a great dad, you know?

43:05.124 --> 43:06.831
I love him a lot.

43:07.001 --> 43:10.164
You have no idea how happy
that makes me, honey.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.666
- Tucker?
- Share with me. Yes?

43:16.844 --> 43:18.960
Do you have the still frames
that we printed?

43:19.138 --> 43:20.924
- Yes, I do.
- Bring them here.

43:21.099 --> 43:24.262
- Eaten by the female, that's why I don't...
- Tucker?

43:24.435 --> 43:26.267
- Tucker, I need you.
- Yes.

43:26.771 --> 43:28.261
Come on.

43:35.488 --> 43:36.944
Here you go.

43:37.115 --> 43:40.233
Here. You give this to your dad...

43:40.409 --> 43:43.743
...and you tell him it was taken yesterday
in our old bedroom.

43:43.913 --> 43:46.996
Oh, I think he will be
very surprised to see it.

43:48.876 --> 43:51.459
I'm so happy to meet you.

43:55.842 --> 43:57.253
Okay.

44:07.603 --> 44:09.014
Testing. One, two.

44:09.188 --> 44:11.054
Can you hear me, guys?

44:11.983 --> 44:14.941
- No.
- I noticed this last night...

44:15.695 --> 44:17.902
...but I couldn't quite place it.

44:18.072 --> 44:21.610
Then Christian reminded me
that when I was a child...

44:21.784 --> 44:24.276
...I saw a red door.

44:24.453 --> 44:28.037
The entity that killed my mother
came through it.

44:30.168 --> 44:34.162
I don't get it. A red door is a red door.
Anyone can see it.

44:34.338 --> 44:36.579
No, it's not a literal door.
It's a metaphysical one.

44:36.757 --> 44:40.125
Remember when I went into The Further
to find Quinn Brenner?

44:40.303 --> 44:42.419
I came across a red door.

44:43.556 --> 44:49.177
<i>And I... I passed through it,
and it took me deeper into The Further.</i>

44:49.353 --> 44:51.845
If I can find out what it means...

44:53.983 --> 44:57.726
...I might be able to stop the thing
that's haunting this house.

44:57.904 --> 45:00.145
Well, this might help.

45:07.580 --> 45:10.368
I spoke to you last night.

45:12.835 --> 45:15.748
Are you there? Can you hear me?

45:22.261 --> 45:24.923
You took something from me.

45:25.097 --> 45:26.713
Why?

45:28.100 --> 45:29.932
<i>Why did you say, "Help her"?</i>

45:30.102 --> 45:31.433
<i>Help who?</i>

46:08.891 --> 46:10.347
This way.

48:07.259 --> 48:08.966
Is that you?

48:11.847 --> 48:14.589
Whistle once for yes, twice for no.

48:14.767 --> 48:17.850
Are you the woman I saw last night?

48:23.067 --> 48:25.855
Is there an entity in this house...

48:26.028 --> 48:28.895
...that is trying to hurt Ted Garza?

48:33.285 --> 48:35.617
Are you that entity?

48:42.128 --> 48:45.086
Is there something
you're trying to show me?

48:50.052 --> 48:52.544
Is what you want to show me...

48:52.721 --> 48:54.962
...behind this wall?

49:36.974 --> 49:38.055
Keys.

49:48.277 --> 49:51.065
Freeze, buddy. Freeze.

49:51.989 --> 49:53.445
On.

49:53.616 --> 49:55.027
Wait. On.

50:56.428 --> 50:57.839
Wait.

51:05.771 --> 51:07.432
Thank you.

51:39.597 --> 51:41.838
What is it you wanna show me?

52:23.807 --> 52:24.968
Help her!

52:48.207 --> 52:50.198
Help me.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.464
That's not a ghost.

52:58.634 --> 53:00.966
Oh, my God.

53:03.430 --> 53:05.512
Oh, my God.

53:05.683 --> 53:07.173
I'll break the chain.

53:07.351 --> 53:08.637
No, you won't.

53:11.897 --> 53:13.228
Move.

53:13.857 --> 53:14.892
Get away from her!

53:15.442 --> 53:18.810
I asked you, help me get rid of the ghost.

53:18.987 --> 53:20.773
Help me get rid of it!

53:20.948 --> 53:22.655
<i>Help me!</i>

53:24.034 --> 53:27.152
Why did you have to come down here?

53:29.623 --> 53:32.957
- Why?!
- Your ghost led us down here.

53:33.127 --> 53:35.368
He's in my head.

53:37.423 --> 53:38.754
He's in my head.

53:57.109 --> 53:59.271
Is that your friend?

54:00.612 --> 54:02.728
That is your friend.

54:53.707 --> 54:55.994
You there, Specs?

55:03.175 --> 55:04.882
Specs!

55:10.933 --> 55:12.173
What?

56:21.503 --> 56:23.790
Her name is Mara Jennings.

56:23.964 --> 56:26.797
She's a nurse from a town
about 10 miles outside of here.

56:26.967 --> 56:29.334
She's been missing
for approximately four months.

56:31.638 --> 56:33.094
Watch your step down.

56:36.059 --> 56:39.768
- Can you stick around for a few days?
- Yeah, we'll be here.

56:39.938 --> 56:42.305
I'm gonna have to get statements
from all of you.

56:52.242 --> 56:55.780
There are plenty of demons in this world
who are very much alive...

56:56.204 --> 56:58.616
...and you stopped one of them.

57:01.793 --> 57:04.330
Thanks, Elise.

57:46.505 --> 57:48.246
Dad, this is crazy.

57:48.423 --> 57:51.040
This is something I have to do.

57:59.768 --> 58:00.849
<i>I gotta find it.</i>

58:01.395 --> 58:04.808
It's a little whistle,
a little silver whistle.

58:04.982 --> 58:08.771
Look, I deal in the spirit world...

58:08.944 --> 58:13.859
...and spirits can make people
do bad things in the real world.

58:14.032 --> 58:17.650
Some of these people come to me
for help.

58:18.578 --> 58:20.319
But to you, that's weird.

58:20.497 --> 58:23.330
To me, it's a day job.

58:26.712 --> 58:28.544
This one was different though.

58:30.132 --> 58:33.124
The haunted house was my house.

58:36.054 --> 58:37.715
It's not in here.

58:38.849 --> 58:40.886
Hey, I'm gonna check on him.

58:42.144 --> 58:44.385
Why would Garza invite you up...

58:44.563 --> 58:47.931
...knowing the risk
that you might discover Mara?

58:53.613 --> 58:58.073
These hauntings can be terrifying things.

58:59.453 --> 59:02.195
Maybe the fear of the beyond...

59:02.372 --> 59:05.740
...overcame the fear of getting caught.

59:06.293 --> 59:08.034
Or maybe he wanted to get caught.

59:12.674 --> 59:14.256
What? What is it?

59:15.635 --> 59:17.217
I'm sorry.

59:17.387 --> 59:20.095
I'm seeing things.

59:20.599 --> 59:22.806
The shock of the whole thing, I suppose.

59:22.976 --> 59:25.013
Do you need me for anything else?

59:25.187 --> 59:26.518
No.

59:26.688 --> 59:28.178
Thank you.

59:37.365 --> 59:38.981
Melissa?

59:40.410 --> 59:41.696
Dad?

59:41.870 --> 59:44.862
Down here, honey. I found the whistle.

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.636
Dad?

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:39.624
- What are you doing here?
- You can't find her, can you?

01:02:39.798 --> 01:02:42.460
What happened to her? Where is she?

01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:44.716
- We've looked everywhere.
- Not everywhere.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:04.107
Oh, God, no.

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:09.737
Imogen, call an ambulance.

01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:11.401
Now!

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:28.836
How did you know where she was?

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.596
What happened to her?

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:35.013
There's something evil in that house...

01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:37.018
...and I let it into this world.

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:39.429
I think it made Ted Garza do
what he did...

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:42.565
...and it's taken your sister's spirit,
and I'm gonna find it...

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:44.602
...and I'm gonna finish it tonight.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.696
I can see things too.

01:04:00.628 --> 01:04:02.960
When I was a little girl...

01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:06.253
...I went to sleep
and floated out of my bedroom...

01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:09.210
...all the way
to our elderly neighbor's house.

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:13.426
Then she told me she was leaving
this world and going on to the next.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.059
My dad told me
she had died the night before.

01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:19.686
I told him I already knew.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:24.482
- He wasn't too happy to hear that.
- Imogen, let's go.

01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:25.858
Come on, honey.

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:28.737
No, I... I'm staying.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.861
Just trust me, okay?

01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:38.155
Come on, boys, let's get our things
and get in the house and get started.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:41.741
Son of a...

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:47.964
I am going to get the attention
of all the spirits in this house.

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:50.216
I need things
that were important to Garza.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:52.378
Specs, go upstairs.

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:55.013
There is a Bible he held very dear to him.

01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:59.142
It was a red King James version,
and I need you to find it.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:01.178
- Take Imogen with you.
- Okay.

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:03.438
- Do not let her out of your sight.
- I won't.

01:05:03.942 --> 01:05:06.434
Tucker and I are going down
to the fallout shelter.

01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:09.820
I get the death chamber,
he gets Bible camp with a beautiful girl?

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:11.104
That's not a democracy.

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:14.400
You're the only one I trust
to go down there with me.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.532
Don't patronize me, woman.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:21.453
So why do you guys dress like that?

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:26.336
It was Elise's idea. She dressed us.

01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:31.250
No, my usual style's a lot more laid back.

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:32.918
It's a little weird.

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:35.588
- What?
- Dude.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:41.552
This is vintage. No, this is worth a lot.

01:05:41.729 --> 01:05:44.471
I'm serious. We gotta find this thing.

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:45.980
I'm just saying.

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.858
- Gotta have hobbies.
- I'm saying.

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:52.021
Can't all be work. Gotta enjoy yourself,
go out on a date.

01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:57.071
You gotta do stuff like that.

01:05:57.245 --> 01:05:58.735
There's something here.

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:02.281
I can feel it.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.661
She wants me to have it.

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:11.839
Oh, that should do it.

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:14.172
- Step aside.
- Yes, sir.

01:06:58.473 --> 01:07:00.510
It's time to sleep.

01:07:13.154 --> 01:07:15.395
I know this slip.

01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:18.235
- This will help you sleep.
- Don't make me drink anymore.

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:20.867
Please, let me go. I beg you.

01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:22.782
There you go.

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:26.411
Please, let me go.

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:29.167
I promise I won't tell.

01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:31.544
Please, let me...

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:05.119
Did you hear that?

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:07.201
Hear what?

01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:14.792
- My brother doesn't believe you're here.
- Christian!

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:19.341
There's someone in the laundry.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:32.854
There's no one here.

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:36.606
You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it.

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:56.500
Goodbye, Anna.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.553
She wasn't dead.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:13.471
My father did the exact same thing
that Garza did.

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:17.309
The woman I saw in this house
all those years ago...

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:20.270
...she was alive.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.984
I could have helped her.

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.662
I let him kill her.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:35.266
Take this thing off.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:37.597
Okay.

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:05.007
Her death was my fault.

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:10.180
Until I free her from
wherever he put her...

01:11:10.892 --> 01:11:13.179
...she's trapped in the dark.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:15.977
Lost.

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:18.183
I'm going in there.

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:20.723
Stand back.

01:11:26.574 --> 01:11:28.406
Go for it.

01:11:28.576 --> 01:11:30.192
I'm good.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.503
I'm sorry, Anna.

01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:28.207
I failed you.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:18.554
Oh, my God.

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:26.899
Where you going?

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.734
Elise.

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:31.062
Elise.

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:53.167
Elise.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.802
You weren't the only one, Anna.

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.142
- Audrey!
- Elise?

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.101
<i>Audrey.</i>

01:15:30.901 --> 01:15:32.107
<i>Audrey.</i>

01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:33.860
Elise.

01:15:34.572 --> 01:15:36.358
Where am I?

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:39.449
You're in a special place...

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:41.993
...where the spirits go.

01:15:42.163 --> 01:15:43.995
Who are you?

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:48.955
I'm a friend.

01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:51.665
I don't wanna be here.

01:15:51.839 --> 01:15:53.796
I don't wanna go where the spirits go.

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:00.302
Elise...

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:04.140
...no matter what your daddy says...

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:07.644
...you have to go on doing what you do.

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:11.898
Never be afraid of your ability.

01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:19.819
Daddy doesn't mean it
when he yells at me.

01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:21.941
He's scared...

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:25.696
...of the man with the keys.

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:28.535
He's the one controlling it all.

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:31.451
He's the one who opens all the doors.

01:16:34.965 --> 01:16:39.004
- He opens all the red doors?
- Yes.

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:42.216
The man with the keys said
I'm more powerful than I know.

01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:44.926
He says he wants me
to help him open every door.

01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:47.593
He says he'll do anything it takes
to get me.

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:52.104
He's standing right behind you.

01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:55.141
<i>No!</i>

01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:58.107
Leave this place!

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:07.074
Elise, wake up.

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:09.618
Elise!

01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:13.204
Specs!

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:15.082
I need help!

01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:18.915
Here, here. Careful with her head.

01:17:20.761 --> 01:17:22.761
- She's on the other side.
- Somebody has to go in.

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:25.680
Yeah, who's gonna do that?
I can't do that. Can you do that?

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:27.215
- I didn't say...
- I can do it.

01:17:30.354 --> 01:17:31.594
I can help her.

01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:35.356
I've never actually hypnotized
anybody before.

01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:37.312
I've never been hypnotized.

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.978
Well, then you won't know
what I'm doing wrong, right?

01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:47.401
Okay.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:52.119
The exercise, it's a little...
I'm gonna... I'll put my finger there.

01:17:52.293 --> 01:17:53.704
E.T.

01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:56.745
Imogen.

01:17:56.922 --> 01:17:58.208
That's pretty cool.

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:00.589
Just look here.

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:03.752
And concentrate on it and just relax.

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:08.511
Imagine that your body is made of water
and you're in the ocean.

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:10.345
That doesn't make sense.

01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:12.847
- What?
- She's made of water...

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:16.310
...and she's in the ocean.
Therefore, she is the ocean.

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:18.816
Would you like to do this?

01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:26.157
- Thank you.
<i>- I'll</i> still be here.

01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:28.409
- Don't touch the subject.
- I'm not.

01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:30.286
Move away.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:49.012
Close your eyes.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:52.972
Listen to the ticking.

01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:55.056
Focus on it.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:58.181
I'm going to count back from five.

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:03.445
By the time I reach one,
you will be hypnotized.

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:06.526
Five, four...

01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:12.119
...three, two, one.

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:14.872
Nod if you can hear me.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:23.085
When I say "now,"
you will open your eyes...

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:26.968
...and you will be on the other side.

01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:32.515
<i>Now.</i>

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:57.832
Wanna go there.

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:21.397
I'll help you.

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:06.392
Red door.

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.061
Red door.

01:21:09.239 --> 01:21:11.822
That's the red door
Elise was talking about.

01:21:12.743 --> 01:21:15.110
This is the place.

01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:44.146
I can't go in there.

01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:46.557
If he finds me, he'll...

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:49.398
He'll take me again.

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:52.780
Trust me. You'll find
what you're looking for in there.

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:57.739
<i>I admit it!</i>

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.495
<i>Shut up!</i>

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:02.532
<i>That's right!</i>

01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:05.209
Elise?

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:09.543
<i>The key is missing.</i>

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:13.588
<i>You're all gonna get it again!</i>

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:36.525
<i>Do you ever think about the people
who go to the electric chair?</i>

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:38.950
<i>Sometimes.</i>

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:41.704
<i>Do you wonder where they go?</i>

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.578
<i>Your turn now.</i>

01:23:21.538 --> 01:23:23.370
<i>Look out, little girl!</i>

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:02.868
<i>--always repeats, my friends.
The ghosts of their past...</i>

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:08.491
<i>--if we do not confront them head-on.</i>

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:30.680
<i>If there's one thing you've been doing
your whole life, Elise, it's ask for it.</i>

01:24:30.857 --> 01:24:33.724
No! No, Daddy!

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:36.735
<i>They're all around us in this house.</i>

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:38.236
<i>Everywhere.</i>

01:24:41.451 --> 01:24:44.614
<i>She needs to learn nobody else
can possibly love someone like her.</i>

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:47.075
Stop, Daddy, stop.

01:24:48.125 --> 01:24:50.958
<i>- No, Daddy, please.</i>
- Please, stop. No.

01:24:51.128 --> 01:24:52.789
- Stop.
<i>- No. No.</i>

01:24:52.963 --> 01:24:55.045
<i>No, Daddy!</i>

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:57.610
<i>Some people are afraid
of special people.</i>

01:24:57.634 --> 01:24:59.875
<i>Your daddy is one of them.</i>

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:06.216
<i>I won't let you hurt me anymore.</i>

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:19.937
<i>Did you see a ghost?</i>

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.356
<i>Just say no. That's all you have to do.</i>

01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:25.947
<i>You can't punish me for this.
I never wanted it. I never asked for it.</i>

01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:30.243
You killed your mother.

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:46.634
Elise.

01:25:49.102 --> 01:25:50.388
Elise!

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:56.106
Elise!

01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:00.566
He's in my head. He's in my head.

01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:03.655
<i>My father did the exact same thing
as Garza.</i>

01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:09.529
My father was your puppet.

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:15.160
I am not gonna feed you
with hatred anymore, demon.

01:26:15.337 --> 01:26:16.668
You can fucking starve.

01:26:19.091 --> 01:26:20.331
Elise!

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:22.207
No!

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:30.262
Leave her alone!
You wanna take somebody, take me.

01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:52.579
Let them go.

01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:55.954
<i>See now?</i>

01:27:06.972 --> 01:27:08.633
Honey? Honey?

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:11.094
Nurse! Nurse, get in here!

01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:13.892
Melissa!

01:27:22.028 --> 01:27:23.268
It's okay, it's okay.

01:27:24.781 --> 01:27:26.522
One, two, three, four.

01:27:37.711 --> 01:27:39.497
I'm sorry.

01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:46.876
No! No!

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:52.840
No!

01:28:12.746 --> 01:28:14.236
Elise!

01:29:05.257 --> 01:29:07.123
Hands off my little girl.

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:45.498
No, no, no.

01:29:45.672 --> 01:29:47.413
Elise!

01:29:47.591 --> 01:29:49.332
She's hurt

01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:31.961
Return to your body. Go.

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:41.516
Baby.

01:30:42.187 --> 01:30:43.803
Oh, Dad.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.392
Elise, she saved me.

01:31:10.173 --> 01:31:11.959
I don't know the words.

01:31:16.262 --> 01:31:18.594
I already know, my love.

01:31:25.647 --> 01:31:27.308
Keep helping people.

01:31:46.876 --> 01:31:48.617
Go home.

01:31:58.221 --> 01:32:00.428
Imogen, wake up!

01:32:01.558 --> 01:32:02.764
Are you okay?

01:32:02.934 --> 01:32:04.174
Yeah, I think so.

01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:10.223
You can't get rid of me that easy.
The hospital.

01:32:14.237 --> 01:32:19.607
<i>Nurse needed in ICU stat.</i>

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:23.819
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey.

01:32:23.997 --> 01:32:25.112
Hi.

01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:26.826
I'm okay.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.287
Oh, my God.

01:32:29.753 --> 01:32:31.243
Hi.

01:32:46.853 --> 01:32:48.560
I believe this is yours.

01:32:55.153 --> 01:32:56.769
You were right, Christian.

01:32:56.946 --> 01:32:58.482
I'm cursed.

01:32:58.656 --> 01:33:01.398
Demons follow me around.

01:33:02.535 --> 01:33:07.621
But I don't want to give them
what they want for one second longer.

01:33:07.791 --> 01:33:10.829
Fear and pain is what feeds them.

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:14.670
I'm the one that's been feeding them...

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:17.331
...shutting you out all these years.

01:33:18.218 --> 01:33:19.834
You forgive me?

01:33:20.011 --> 01:33:22.127
I never should have left you.

01:33:29.687 --> 01:33:31.394
Thank you.

01:33:32.107 --> 01:33:33.689
Yes.

01:33:41.324 --> 01:33:42.985
Melissa...

01:33:43.159 --> 01:33:44.991
...you gonna eat that?

01:33:46.412 --> 01:33:47.868
Go for it.

01:33:51.543 --> 01:33:55.958
You know, I always thought
that I was afraid of dying...

01:33:57.006 --> 01:33:59.794
...but now I realize that I wasn't.

01:34:00.593 --> 01:34:02.675
I was afraid of dying...

01:34:02.846 --> 01:34:06.089
...before I truly had a family again.

01:34:07.851 --> 01:34:09.558
Now I do.

01:34:10.019 --> 01:34:11.680
Son of a...

01:34:12.355 --> 01:34:13.845
I told you not to park there.

01:34:14.023 --> 01:34:16.856
- Just saying, I did.
- Listen to your buddy.

01:34:17.694 --> 01:34:20.186
He gets the girl, I get the ticket?

01:34:21.531 --> 01:34:22.987
I'm riding shotgun.

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:26.025
We'll have to come back here
to deal with that ticket.

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:12.199
Dalton.

01:35:12.874 --> 01:35:15.957
Today was just so horrible.
I'm scared nothing's gonna change.

01:35:16.127 --> 01:35:17.458
It will.

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:19.753
I promise you.

01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:22.331
<i>Just gotta give it time.</i>

01:35:42.862 --> 01:35:45.024
Oh, Dalton.

01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:00.539
Hello.

01:36:00.713 --> 01:36:04.377
<i>I'm so sorry for calling so late.
My name ls Lorraine.</i>

01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:08.714
<i>You helped my family a long time ago
when my son was just a boy.</i>

01:36:08.888 --> 01:36:11.801
<i>And now the same thing is happening
to my grandson.</i>

01:36:11.975 --> 01:36:13.557
Dalton.

01:36:13.977 --> 01:36:15.342
<i>How did you know his name?</i>

01:36:16.396 --> 01:36:18.387
It's what I do.

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.687
Tell Josh I'll be there in the morning.

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:24.601
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:36:24.779 --> 01:36:27.521
- Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>
