00:02.719 --> 00:05.400
NARRATOR: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:05.440 --> 00:06.040
-You like him.

00:06.080 --> 00:07.599
-No, I don't.

00:07.639 --> 00:10.400
-Practically every friend I've
ever had has fallen for him.

00:10.439 --> 00:11.919
It's pathetic, right?

00:11.960 --> 00:14.759
-When Mia went on exchange, we
wrote up a pros and cons list.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.239
And it-- and it helped
clarify our feelings.

00:17.280 --> 00:21.399
So, Ethan Karamakov.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.839
-Abigail--

00:22.879 --> 00:27.199
she emailed the pros and cons
list to the whole school.

00:27.239 --> 00:28.600
[sirens]

00:28.640 --> 00:29.600
[grunt]

00:29.640 --> 00:30.600
[shouting]

00:30.640 --> 00:31.120
-Yeah, look.

00:31.160 --> 00:31.960
I'm--

00:32.000 --> 00:32.799
I'm coming to stay for awhile.

00:32.840 --> 00:36.240
No, I won't cause any trouble.

00:36.280 --> 00:38.159
It wouldn't be forever.

00:38.200 --> 00:38.759
Yeah.

00:38.799 --> 00:39.640
No, it's all good.

00:39.679 --> 00:40.640
All right.

00:40.679 --> 00:41.840
Bye.

00:58.159 --> 01:01.520
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

01:01.560 --> 01:05.120
Close your eyes.

01:05.159 --> 01:09.519
Take a leap of faith
and lead the way

01:09.560 --> 01:13.120
tonight, tonight, tonight.

01:13.159 --> 01:15.079
This is my chance.

01:15.120 --> 01:19.480
This is my chance, my chance
to feel alive.

01:39.079 --> 01:41.040
INSTRUCTOR (OFFSCREEN): And
double back mon frappe.

01:41.079 --> 01:43.480
Extend out and out.

01:43.519 --> 01:46.200
And petit back mon.

01:46.239 --> 01:47.159
TARA NARRATING: Everyone
thinks a farm

01:47.200 --> 01:48.680
is a dangerous place.

01:48.719 --> 01:50.640
But not to me.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.760
I know every rabbit hole, broken
fence, and rusty nail.

01:54.799 --> 01:56.599
-And nice long necks.

01:56.640 --> 01:59.799
TARA NARRATING: No matter
where I am, I'm safe.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.480
INSTRUCTOR (OFFSCREEN):
Ribs in, Tara.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.199
And balance.

02:17.479 --> 02:18.319
And down.

02:18.360 --> 02:18.919
And recover.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.759
Thank you, ladies.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.120
To the center, everyone.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.759
Tara?

02:27.800 --> 02:29.759
You may join us.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.039
TARA NARRATING: But
the Academy is

02:31.080 --> 02:32.280
a whole other planet.

02:40.879 --> 02:43.599
One minute, you think you
know your way around.

02:43.639 --> 02:44.319
The next--

02:44.360 --> 02:45.680
-Tara, plie.

02:45.719 --> 02:47.400
TARA NARRATING: --you realize
you're in a mine field.

02:50.840 --> 02:55.080
Everywhere I look, there's
a new trap.

02:55.120 --> 03:02.080
-Smells like Christmas when
he sweet talks about

03:02.120 --> 03:05.479
things, real things.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.479
TARA NARRATING: Another enemy.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.240
Danger around every corner.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.479
And just when you think it's
game over, the universe gives

03:18.520 --> 03:21.319
you a bonus life.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.120
-First everybody thinks I got
my gear off in the boys'

03:24.159 --> 03:24.879
changing room.

03:24.919 --> 03:26.639
And now this stupid list.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.560
Can it get any worse?

03:28.599 --> 03:30.479
-Well, uh, since you asked.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.319
-At least I'm not the first
negative on your list.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.439
I suppose I should
be thankful.

03:39.479 --> 03:40.439
-I'm really--

03:40.479 --> 03:42.280
uh, I'm truly sorry, Kat.

03:42.319 --> 03:44.800
I never meant to drag
you into my mess.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.520
-Yet here I am, just some
sort of obstacle

03:47.560 --> 03:48.680
on your way to Ethan.

03:48.719 --> 03:49.840
-Trust me.

03:49.879 --> 03:51.599
I'm trying to find every
possible reason not

03:51.639 --> 03:54.560
to feel this way.

03:54.599 --> 03:56.639
-Here's a great reason.

03:56.680 --> 04:00.199
My brother will break
your heart.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.080
And when he does, I'm not going
to be there to supply

04:02.120 --> 04:03.319
the tissues.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.719
-I promise I'm avoiding him.

04:12.439 --> 04:15.080
-So you think Abigail sent
it to third years?

04:15.120 --> 04:17.360
-He read it.

04:17.399 --> 04:18.560
-Just kill me now.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.040
-Right.

04:29.079 --> 04:30.800
Pop quiz.

04:30.839 --> 04:33.079
Who can tell me the real
meaning of pas de deux?

04:33.120 --> 04:34.279
-Pas de deux.

04:34.319 --> 04:35.480
I means dance of two.

04:35.519 --> 04:36.399
-Good.

04:36.439 --> 04:37.839
That's its literal
translation.

04:37.879 --> 04:41.759
But what does it really mean,
beneath the French words,

04:41.800 --> 04:43.160
metaphorically?

04:44.800 --> 04:46.639
Pas de deux--

04:46.680 --> 04:49.399
two bodies, one soul.

04:49.439 --> 04:50.800
A guy and a girl dancing
together to

04:50.839 --> 04:54.079
produce one pure emotion.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.399
That's what today's class
is all about.

04:55.439 --> 04:56.399
MALE STUDENT (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, yeah.

04:56.439 --> 04:57.439
[giggling]

04:57.480 --> 04:59.639
-I've never dance with
a boy before.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.639
It's true.

05:00.680 --> 05:01.439
Back home, girls dance
with girls.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.199
There were no guys.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.560
-Don't worry.

05:04.600 --> 05:05.639
First-year boys are just sweaty
creatures that try and

05:05.680 --> 05:07.040
pull on your toes a lot.

05:07.079 --> 05:10.199
-There are three important
ingredients in pas de deux--

05:10.240 --> 05:12.720
trust.

05:12.759 --> 05:13.319
Good.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.639
Pass it on.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.319
Good.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.279
Keep it going.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.480
Unity.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.480
Great.

05:24.519 --> 05:28.800
And most important of
all, communication.

05:28.839 --> 05:31.319
[laughter]

05:31.360 --> 05:34.600
-Without them, well--

05:34.639 --> 05:36.759
So our star pas de deux couple
from third year have agreed to

05:36.800 --> 05:37.839
help out today.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.079
Ethan, Isabel, good
of you to join us.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.639
Now, let's divide
you into pairs.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.160
Can you go with Sean?

05:47.839 --> 05:49.120
Remember to find unity.

05:49.160 --> 05:53.040
You need trust and
communication.

05:53.079 --> 05:55.639
-Are your hands always
this clammy?

05:55.680 --> 05:57.160
-I'm allergic to you.

05:57.199 --> 05:59.120
-Focus on who you're
dancing with.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.319
No one else should matter.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.639
-Do you want that in plaster?

06:19.319 --> 06:22.839
-Relax, you're doing fine.

06:22.879 --> 06:26.199
-What a great class.

06:26.240 --> 06:29.759
I just meant Patrick's
such a great teacher.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.120
-Mm.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.600
-Do you think it's a sign the
universe is throwing us

06:32.639 --> 06:33.199
together.

06:33.240 --> 06:33.800
-Ah, la, la, la.

06:33.839 --> 06:35.279
-Before you leave.

06:35.319 --> 06:36.639
I've arranged with Miss Raine
for you to have the rest of

06:36.680 --> 06:38.439
the day off from your
regular classes.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.120
-Yes!

06:39.160 --> 06:41.199
-Don't get too excited.

06:41.240 --> 06:43.199
Instead, you'll be doing
an exercise for me.

06:43.240 --> 06:43.800
Same couples.

06:43.839 --> 06:45.399
One of you choose.

06:45.439 --> 06:48.439
And remember, you'll be marked
on this exercise exactly as

06:48.480 --> 06:49.639
you would any other
assessment.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.279
KAT (OFFSCREEN): This
totally blows!

06:56.319 --> 06:58.800
One blindfolded, the other
a seeing eye dog.

06:58.839 --> 06:59.319
-Woof.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.480
[laughs]

07:00.519 --> 07:01.800
-Gross.

07:01.839 --> 07:02.920
-Swap you.

07:02.959 --> 07:05.560
You can be tied to Abigail
for 24 hours!

07:05.600 --> 07:08.399
-I'd rather stab myself in the
eye with a blunt spoon.

07:08.439 --> 07:11.480
-It can't possibly be
24 hours, Clemmy.

07:11.519 --> 07:12.600
Nobody else got that long.

07:12.639 --> 07:13.399
-I did.

07:13.439 --> 07:16.480
20 questions over 24 hours.

07:16.519 --> 07:17.920
-That's it?

07:17.959 --> 07:20.319
Ask anything you like of each
other, but you must answer

07:20.360 --> 07:21.519
truthfully.

07:21.560 --> 07:24.560
-Like I want to know anything
about Christian.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.399
So you're not the only one.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.399
-Sagittarian.

07:33.439 --> 07:34.480
Favorite food-- pizza.

07:34.519 --> 07:36.199
Don't have a lucky number.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.120
And we're done.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.319
-No, we're not.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.199
This exercise is important.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.519
-Well, I know everything
about you.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.480
It's kind of being broadcast
around the whole school.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.480
-Where are you going?

07:47.519 --> 07:49.600
-The beach.

07:49.639 --> 07:51.600
[music playing]

08:00.079 --> 08:01.519
-I love this this city.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.399
-Man, check out that view.

08:04.439 --> 08:06.399
-I'm going to go and
find Christian.

08:06.439 --> 08:08.439
-We'll be down here, checking
out the bay.

08:08.480 --> 08:08.879
-[laughs]

08:08.920 --> 08:10.800
Excellent.

08:10.839 --> 08:13.399
-Oh, I'm going to love
this exercise.

08:27.319 --> 08:28.360
-You some sort of stalker.

08:28.399 --> 08:29.199
Not always.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.639
You've got 19 questions left.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.120
So where did you grow up?

08:34.159 --> 08:35.159
-Melba.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.159
[inaudible].

08:36.200 --> 08:37.799
-By the beach, lucky.

08:37.840 --> 08:38.320
-Yeah.

08:38.360 --> 08:38.799
Houso.

08:38.840 --> 08:39.759
Real lucky.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.480
-Houso?

08:41.519 --> 08:42.279
-Housing Commission.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.240
Where the poor people live.

08:45.279 --> 08:47.360
-You think I'm rich?

08:47.399 --> 08:49.360
-You're at the Academy,
aren't you?

08:49.399 --> 08:50.440
-So are you.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.159
-Yeah, well, that's different.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.840
I won't be for long.

08:53.879 --> 08:55.679
-You've got brothers
and sisters?

08:55.720 --> 08:57.519
-I've got one brother.

08:57.559 --> 08:59.080
-Are you close?

08:59.120 --> 09:00.480
-He's in Broken Hill.

09:00.519 --> 09:03.399
-I mean, emotionally close.

09:03.440 --> 09:04.320
-He's flesh and blood.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.480
Why wouldn't we be close?

09:08.720 --> 09:10.600
-What about your parents?

09:10.639 --> 09:13.840
What does your dad do?

09:13.879 --> 09:15.320
-This and that.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.799
-You have to answer.

09:16.840 --> 09:17.480
-Says who?

09:17.519 --> 09:18.159
-That's the rules.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.120
What does your dad do?

09:19.159 --> 09:19.639
-Oh, right.

09:19.679 --> 09:20.120
The rules, OK.

09:20.159 --> 09:21.120
My turn.

09:21.159 --> 09:22.200
How far have you gone
with a guy?

09:25.240 --> 09:25.799
The rules.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.080
How far?

09:28.120 --> 09:28.799
There's first base.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.399
There's second base.

09:31.440 --> 09:35.639
You even have bases
your side of town?

09:35.679 --> 09:36.840
Ever even kissed a guy?

09:39.840 --> 09:43.240
You haven't, have you?

09:43.279 --> 09:46.399
Maybe I could, uh,
help you out.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.759
-Maybe you could get lost.

09:48.799 --> 09:50.200
-Hey, I asked you a couple
of questions!

10:04.639 --> 10:05.559
-Abigail!

10:05.600 --> 10:07.200
I'm trying to read.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.799
-And I'm trying to strengthen
my core.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.440
-We could so be doing this
at the beach right now.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.080
-I don't do beach.

10:16.120 --> 10:18.039
-Why, do you have an aversion
to fresh air?

10:18.080 --> 10:19.519
-I don't do sand.

10:19.559 --> 10:20.759
I don't do salt.

10:20.799 --> 10:22.399
And I don't do sun.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.120
-Great.

10:25.159 --> 10:26.480
-I need my water.

10:29.879 --> 10:36.320
-So do I. [inaudible]

10:36.360 --> 10:37.559
first, now wouldn't we?

10:43.159 --> 10:44.360
-It's not like I'm interested.

10:44.399 --> 10:45.840
I'm only doing this
for school.

10:45.879 --> 10:49.159
Um, I don't care what his
favorite color is, or what his

10:49.200 --> 10:50.000
family does.

10:50.039 --> 10:50.600
-So did he tell you anything?

10:53.440 --> 10:53.879
Ow!

10:53.919 --> 10:55.159
-It was him!

10:57.480 --> 10:59.759
-Oh, let's go to the beach
and do the exercise.

10:59.799 --> 11:01.080
It'll be so fun.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.519
-I didn't know he'd be here.

11:02.559 --> 11:03.240
Honest.

11:03.279 --> 11:03.919
-Yeah, right.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.039
What are you doing here?

11:05.080 --> 11:06.240
-Perks of being a third year.

11:06.279 --> 11:07.720
Let me guess.

11:07.759 --> 11:10.720
Patrick's first-year trust,
unity, communication exercise?

11:10.759 --> 11:12.320
You know, it's best
to goof off.

11:12.360 --> 11:12.919
-Thanks.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.759
Now we know that.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.159
-Tara, ball?

11:17.200 --> 11:20.639
You guys can play as
well if you want.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.200
-Don't look me at
like that, Tara?

11:22.240 --> 11:23.320
-How do you know how I'm--

11:23.360 --> 11:24.600
-I might be blindfolded,
but I'm not blind.

11:24.639 --> 11:25.399
-Come on.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.519
It's just a game of soccer.

11:26.559 --> 11:28.639
Please?

11:28.679 --> 11:30.600
[music playing]

11:44.440 --> 11:46.399
-I am not the goal, people!

11:46.440 --> 11:47.600
Not the goal.

11:54.759 --> 11:55.320
Oh!

11:55.360 --> 11:56.240
That's it!

11:56.279 --> 11:59.639
Tiger is leaving!

11:59.679 --> 12:01.639
Coming, Tara?

12:01.679 --> 12:03.320
-Think I'm going to stay.

12:03.360 --> 12:03.679
-Come on, Tara.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.240
Kick it.

12:05.279 --> 12:07.600
I haven't finished the
assignment with Christian yet.

12:07.639 --> 12:08.480
-Come on.

12:08.519 --> 12:09.639
We're out of here.

12:19.840 --> 12:24.399
-You know, at some point in this
scenario, toilets will

12:24.440 --> 12:26.080
come into play.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.600
-You can hold on.

12:27.639 --> 12:29.399
-No, not for 24 hours.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.360
-I'm starving.

12:35.399 --> 12:36.600
-Yeah, me too.

12:36.639 --> 12:38.039
-Swim, then food?

12:38.080 --> 12:38.480
-Yeah!

12:38.519 --> 12:39.639
-Yeah!

12:42.879 --> 12:43.840
-I'll go and get--

12:43.879 --> 12:45.440
I'll get some food!

13:02.639 --> 13:05.080
-It's closed for fumigation.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.320
Find another one.

13:09.679 --> 13:11.600
Why do boys' toilets
stink so much?

13:11.639 --> 13:15.039
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): Why do
you have to be so nasty?

13:15.080 --> 13:16.399
-It's a fact.

13:16.440 --> 13:17.759
They stink.

13:17.799 --> 13:18.519
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): No, I'm
talking about Tara's list.

13:18.559 --> 13:19.360
OK?

13:19.399 --> 13:20.840
Why did you broadcast it?

13:20.879 --> 13:23.639
I just think that's cruel
and unnecessary.

13:23.679 --> 13:26.639
-Less thinking and more doing,
before we both die of

13:26.679 --> 13:28.039
asphyxiation.

13:33.519 --> 13:37.440
-Abigail, I can't go while
you're listening.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.440
Do you think maybe you could
whistle or sing or something?

Please?

from spamming that list

15:08.360 --> 15:09.679
everywhere.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.480
-You're like an annoying little
insect, buzzing around.

15:11.519 --> 15:12.639
-Abigail, It just makes
you look bad.

15:12.679 --> 15:13.399
-Bzz.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.360
Bzz.

15:14.399 --> 15:14.720
-Don't you want people
to like--

15:14.759 --> 15:15.200
-Bzz.

15:15.240 --> 15:15.559
Bzz.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.399
-Fine.

15:16.440 --> 15:17.480
Look, won't say another word.

15:17.519 --> 15:19.799
Here you go.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.720
-Carbs after 3:00?

15:21.759 --> 15:25.559
-I'd rather eat a deep-fried
vending machine.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.679
-Hey, where's Tara?

15:26.720 --> 15:29.320

Whoo.

You're hot.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.399
[laughs]

15:55.440 --> 15:58.559
There's, uh, plenty
of room on my lap.

Go back to my car!

16:03.600 --> 16:05.559
-Come on, we'll get 'em later.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.159
-Do you have a death wish?

16:12.200 --> 16:13.519
-Didn't you see what they
were going to do to me?

16:13.559 --> 16:14.519
-No, it doesn't matter.

16:14.559 --> 16:17.120
You don't pick fights
around here.

16:17.159 --> 16:18.480
What are you still doing
here, anyway?

16:18.519 --> 16:20.480
-Well, if you must know, I'm
waiting for the bus.

16:20.519 --> 16:21.120
-Oh, what?

16:21.159 --> 16:22.200
No limo today?

16:22.240 --> 16:23.759
-When have you ever
seen me in a limo.

16:23.799 --> 16:25.399
You know nothing about me.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.799
-Way more than I want to know.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.559
-Ugh, I've never met
anybody so rude.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.080
-Doesn't your mother
teach you manners?

16:33.360 --> 16:34.519
-She's dead.

16:49.639 --> 16:51.519
-Oh, just call her if
you're worried.

16:51.559 --> 16:52.399
-Who says I'm worried?

16:52.440 --> 16:54.519
I'm just checking messages.

16:54.559 --> 16:56.399
What would you know, anyway?

16:56.440 --> 16:57.759
-I can see everything.

16:57.799 --> 17:01.080
This whole communication
thing must be working.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.399
-Yeah?

17:02.440 --> 17:03.600
Can you see this?

17:07.240 --> 17:09.640
-I can't imagine what it would
be like to lose my mom.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.598
-No, you can't

17:12.640 --> 17:14.839
-Did she dance?

17:14.880 --> 17:17.160
-Yeah, when she was young.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.839
-Is that why you're
at the Academy?

17:19.880 --> 17:22.200
-I promised my mom
I'd audition.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.200
Doesn't mean I'm
hanging around.

17:24.240 --> 17:24.799
-You're going to quit?

17:24.839 --> 17:26.640
I'm not into it.

-Suit yourself.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.640
-I've seen you dance.

17:31.680 --> 17:32.400
-Fine.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.839
You think you know me?

17:33.880 --> 17:35.200
True or false--

17:35.240 --> 17:36.759
I've got a brother.

17:36.799 --> 17:38.160
-True.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.240
He's in Broken Hill.

17:40.279 --> 17:41.559
-Very good.

17:41.599 --> 17:44.480
And let's say I got
in some trouble,

17:44.519 --> 17:45.480
say, something serious.

17:45.519 --> 17:46.720
Maybe I need his help.

17:46.759 --> 17:48.079
Do I call him?

17:48.119 --> 17:48.680
-I don't know.

17:48.720 --> 17:49.519
Probably.

17:49.559 --> 17:50.640
You said you guys were close.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.680
-So you expect him
to answer, right?

Brother helping brother?

17:54.359 --> 17:55.400
-Um--

17:55.440 --> 17:57.400
-Not till I call him
from a land line.

17:57.440 --> 18:01.319
No caller ID to recognize, so
he didn't know it was me.

18:01.359 --> 18:03.839
Well, you know everything.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.640
Is this true or false?

18:07.680 --> 18:09.039
-I'd like to say it's
false, but--

18:11.559 --> 18:13.200
-See, you know nothing.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.599
I made it up.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.200
Me and my brother
are tight as.

18:43.519 --> 18:44.799
-I've got one question left.

Question twenty.

-Hit me.

-Why did you tell everyone
about me in the

18:54.480 --> 18:56.559
boys' changing rooms?

18:56.599 --> 18:59.400
-You knew it was an accident.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.200
-Now, why would I even bother?

19:01.240 --> 19:04.680
-I can't believe you'd
still lie about it.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.039
I know you did.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.599
-You know, I wasn't the
only one there.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.400
You ever thought about that?

19:46.759 --> 19:48.440
-It says two to four hours.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.680
Two dash four, not 24!

19:51.720 --> 19:53.240
-Tara, what do you think?

19:53.279 --> 19:56.400
Does that say-- does that
say two to four or 24?

19:56.440 --> 19:58.799
-Well, it's got a two
and a four in it.

20:01.799 --> 20:02.799
You

20:02.839 --> 20:04.000
-Want to know why I'm
so mean to Tara?

20:04.039 --> 20:05.599
Because the three of you
are a bunch of idiots.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.319
-Hey.

20:22.359 --> 20:23.200
-What's going on?

20:23.240 --> 20:23.880
-How you doing?

20:23.920 --> 20:25.400
What are you up to?

20:25.440 --> 20:27.400
-I need to talk to you.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.799
[laughter]

20:30.839 --> 20:31.559
-What's up?

20:31.599 --> 20:32.920
-Like you don't know.

20:32.960 --> 20:36.559
You've been laughing at me this
whole time, haven't you?

20:36.599 --> 20:37.319
-Excuse me?

20:37.359 --> 20:38.759
-Starting audition week.

the boys' changing rooms.

20:39.759 --> 20:41.279
That was you, wasn't it?

-Well, you have to admit
it's a funny story.

-What?

20:46.440 --> 20:47.599
But you weren't even with us.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.440
-Not responding to my
pros and cons list.

20:49.480 --> 20:50.799
-Oh, I didn't realize that
required a response.

20:50.839 --> 20:52.759
-Of course it did!

20:52.799 --> 20:54.039
It's not fair.

20:54.079 --> 20:56.119
Because of you, the whole school
is laughing at me.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.319
-How is that because of me?

21:00.960 --> 21:04.240
-Look, if you want to know
the truth, I was

21:04.279 --> 21:05.559
embarrassed by it.

21:05.599 --> 21:06.759
I mean, I've spoken
to you what?

21:06.799 --> 21:08.400
Three, four times?

21:08.440 --> 21:10.200
And then you go and write
all that stuff

21:10.240 --> 21:12.400
and send it to everyone.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.119
I mean, come on.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.559
What are you talking
about here?

21:15.599 --> 21:17.160
I don't even know you.

-She can't talk to you.

21:58.599 --> 22:01.920
-Yes, she can.

-You said you were sick
of girls coming

22:03.640 --> 22:05.279

-Better.

like it or not, for the next

23:20.920 --> 23:22.680
