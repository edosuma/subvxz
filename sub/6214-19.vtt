WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:04.605
Well, you'll be
happy to know
that Aaron and I

00:04.605 --> 00:06.840
have finally
picked the place
to have our wedding.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.108
Oh, the Ritz?
The Four Seasons?

00:08.108 --> 00:09.142
The backyard.

00:09.142 --> 00:11.311
Oh, well, that's very...

00:11.311 --> 00:13.714
I thought Aaron had money.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.083
He does,
but Sabrina and I

00:16.083 --> 00:19.019
decided on having
a simple, unpretentious wedding.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.488
Yes, we just want to exchange
our vows in an intimate setting,

00:21.488 --> 00:23.891
surrounded by only family,
friends, and, you know,

00:23.891 --> 00:25.359
the people we invited
just for gifts.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.728
Have you thought
of professing your love

00:27.728 --> 00:29.429
naked under an old elm tree,

00:29.429 --> 00:31.598
surrounded
by Mother Earth's beauty?

00:31.598 --> 00:33.267
Well, we checked,
but Mother Earth

00:33.267 --> 00:34.902
is booked solid.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.670
Yeah, that naked
under the elm tree thing...

00:36.670 --> 00:37.804
Forget it.

00:41.208 --> 00:47.180
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

00:47.180 --> 00:53.720

<i>They can have</i>

01:17.544 --> 01:19.913
their simple
trailer-park wedding,

01:19.913 --> 01:23.584
but I am going to throw her
a first-class bridal shower.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.219
You're planning
a shower for Sabrina?
Yep.

01:26.219 --> 01:27.487
But that's
the maid of honor's job.

01:27.487 --> 01:28.789
And she hasn't even
picked one yet.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.558
Well, I think we know
who that's going to be,

01:31.558 --> 01:32.659
Miss Earth Mother.

01:32.659 --> 01:35.462
So, I'm sending out the
invitations tomorrow.

01:35.462 --> 01:38.198
Oh, it's going to be tough
to send out invitations

01:38.198 --> 01:39.766
when I have
her address book.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.069
I have been looking
all over for that!

01:42.069 --> 01:45.172
Sorry, but my invitations are
already stamped and ready to go.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.876
I can't believe this.

01:49.876 --> 01:50.877
Casual?

01:50.877 --> 01:52.713
Who raised you?

01:54.314 --> 01:58.585
Okay, <i>Today's Bride,</i>
<i>Modern Bride, Bridle Path...</i>

01:58.585 --> 02:00.621
I thought she looked
a little horsey.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.923
Okay, let's head out.

02:02.923 --> 02:03.957
Head out?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.292
Yeah, to the bridal fair?

02:05.292 --> 02:07.661
I thought we could knock off
all of our wedding preparations

02:07.661 --> 02:08.695
in one afternoon.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.097
A bridal fair?

02:10.097 --> 02:12.599
But... why do I have to go?

02:12.599 --> 02:15.135
Because there's no such thing
as a "groom-al" fair.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.471
Look, this is our wedding.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.506
Don't you think we should
make every decision together?

02:19.506 --> 02:21.975
But I'll be
the only guy there.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.443
No, you won't.

02:24.511 --> 02:25.245
How about that?

02:25.245 --> 02:27.080
You're the only guy here.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.316
You know, I can't
believe this place.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.085
It's as big as the
auto show, only with...

02:32.085 --> 02:34.221
tons of things
I don't care about.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.256
Oh, come on, how could you
not care about tiaras?

02:36.256 --> 02:38.125
You're really not going to
wear one of those, are you?

02:38.125 --> 02:38.992
Why not?

02:38.992 --> 02:41.461
This way, I can not only be
the center of attention,

02:41.461 --> 02:43.296
but I can also be
the centerpiece.

02:43.296 --> 02:46.366
Yeah, you could always
wear it backwards.

02:46.366 --> 02:47.768
Yeah, very hip-hop.

02:49.036 --> 02:51.004
Hello, welcome to Taffeta Town.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.140
Oh, look at how big
this thing is.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.541
I mean, you could
get married <i>in</i> it,

02:54.541 --> 02:56.476
and then have
the reception
underneath it.

02:56.476 --> 02:59.212
Yeah, with a fairly
decent-sized dance floor.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.847
WOMAN:
I said ivory!

03:00.847 --> 03:01.648
Not off-white!

03:01.648 --> 03:02.783
Not ecru!

03:02.783 --> 03:06.053
Why is everyone
conspiring against me!

03:07.421 --> 03:08.922
Sabrina, if I haven't
said it lately,

03:08.922 --> 03:11.725
I am very glad
to be marrying you.

03:11.725 --> 03:12.826
Thank you.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.262
And no, you can't
go wait in the car.

03:15.262 --> 03:16.263
Worth a shot.

03:16.263 --> 03:18.265
Check out
this monstrosity!

03:18.265 --> 03:21.568
Oh, I've got to try it on,
just for a laugh.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.670
Ooh, and a little exercise.

03:23.670 --> 03:24.705
Wait, you're...

03:24.705 --> 03:26.373
not going to leave me
out here alone are you?

03:26.373 --> 03:27.607
I mean, what am I
supposed to do?

03:27.607 --> 03:30.143
Hold my purse.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.478
Would you like some help?

03:31.478 --> 03:33.447
SABRINA:
Uh, no, I think
I got it.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.549
Or it's got me.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.550
Look out.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.285
Giant doily coming through.

03:38.285 --> 03:39.720
Oh, you look beautiful.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.688
No, I look ridiculous.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.824
I feel like a giant blimp
on her way to cotillion.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.859
Aaron's going to get such a...

03:45.859 --> 03:49.696
Oh, my gosh...

03:49.696 --> 03:52.599
I'm a princess!

03:52.599 --> 03:55.068
Would you like to see
the matching veil?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.370
It comes with a veil?

04:00.941 --> 04:03.376
So, I thought for the shower,
we could do a high tea

04:03.376 --> 04:06.646
with assorted finger sandwiches,
followed by parlor games.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.615
I think we should have
a Goddess Festival.

04:08.615 --> 04:11.051
We can weave bracelets,
give each other henna tattoos,

04:11.051 --> 04:12.052
sing folk songs--

04:12.052 --> 04:13.453
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

04:13.453 --> 04:14.521
Hold on, Sister Moon.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.423
If I am going to let you
help me plan this shower--

04:16.423 --> 04:18.725
Help you?
I'm letting you help me.

04:18.725 --> 04:19.693
Besides, I think
I know Sabrina

04:19.693 --> 04:20.861
better than you, which is why

04:20.861 --> 04:23.163
she is going to pick me
as her maid of honor.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.898
Well, you got
the "maid" part right.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.100
Oh, this is great!

04:27.100 --> 04:29.603
Not only am I getting a husband,
but I'm getting a Sherpa.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.838
Wow, that's a whole lot
of simple going on.

04:31.838 --> 04:32.906
Yeah, simple went out

04:32.906 --> 04:34.775
with the six-foot
cherub ice sculpture.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.345
Well, if you're happy,
I'm happy.

04:38.345 --> 04:40.347
I'm ecstatic.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.448
Okay, you're
officially released.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.449
Go be a guy.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.450
But only
to a certain point.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.886
I'm on it.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.120
Sabrina, what happened?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.555
Well, I got to thinking.

04:48.555 --> 04:51.258
You know, a wedding
is really for the guests,

04:51.258 --> 04:53.693
so what kind of hostess
would I be if I didn't give them

04:53.693 --> 04:55.395
a little show,
a little razzle-dazzle,

04:55.395 --> 04:58.932
a little napkin
folded like a swan?

04:58.932 --> 05:01.101
Oh, thank goodness
you've come around.

05:01.101 --> 05:04.204
I mean, how many times does a
girl get to walk down the aisle?

05:04.204 --> 05:05.972
Two, three times tops.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.707
Wait until you see my veil.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.810
It's like a mini-gown
for my head!

05:13.346 --> 05:15.182
Salem,
I've seen the future,

05:15.182 --> 05:17.450
and it's me
dressed as a princess.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.452
I've had
the very same dream.

05:19.452 --> 05:20.453
About you...

05:20.453 --> 05:22.589
Wait, that didn't
sound right either.

05:22.589 --> 05:23.790
You know, I realize

05:23.790 --> 05:25.992
this wedding is going
to set the tone

05:25.992 --> 05:27.727
for our whole fairy-tale
life together.

05:27.727 --> 05:30.130
I mean, without the poison
apples and singing dwarfs.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.499
Just to clarify,
I don't dream

05:32.499 --> 05:34.901
about you in dresses
<i>all</i> the time.

05:34.901 --> 05:36.670
Oh, I have so much to do,
I don't know where to start.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.905
I mean, I have to book
a ballroom, a caterer,

05:38.905 --> 05:41.074
musicians...

05:41.074 --> 05:43.643
You know, how do you even start
to plan a fairy-tale wedding?

05:43.643 --> 05:44.978
At the beginning!

05:44.978 --> 05:47.414
"Once upon a time,
there was a handsome young cat."

05:47.414 --> 05:49.616
What I need to do
is talk to a real princess.

05:49.616 --> 05:52.986
Oh, of course.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.956
Daddy, please,
don't take away
my gold card!

05:55.956 --> 05:57.157
Wrong kind of princess.

06:00.126 --> 06:01.795
I swear spells like that
are just designed

06:01.795 --> 06:04.497
to help keep the magic book
publishers in business.

06:04.497 --> 06:08.235
Okay, princess...
let's see.

06:08.235 --> 06:09.135
Oh!

06:09.135 --> 06:10.303
Hey, look at this.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.471
Cinderella... perfect.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.444
Hello.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.515
Cinderella Charming.

06:22.515 --> 06:23.984
Sabrina, frantic.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.886
So, you took
your husband's name.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.387
Um, I'm a traditionalist.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.522
Plus, my maiden name
was Schnieberger.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.258
Ooh, good call.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.293
So, I was hoping
you would help me.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.528
See, I'm trying to plan
the perfect fairy-tale wedding

06:35.528 --> 06:38.164
with all the trimmings:
doves, wandering minstrels...

06:38.164 --> 06:40.700
A gilded carriage with coachmen?

06:40.700 --> 06:42.369
Uh, I don't think
Aaron's going to go for that.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.070
He's talking about
having his brother drive us

06:44.070 --> 06:45.071
in his minivan.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.640
Oh, first mistake.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.141
You're the bride.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.776
This is your special day.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.412
You've got to insist
on getting everything you want

06:52.445 --> 06:55.215
and the rest
will fall into place.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.449
So you think it's possible
for me to have

06:56.449 --> 06:57.584
the wedding of my dreams?

06:57.584 --> 07:00.787
Honey, I was a chimney sweep
who married a prince,

07:00.787 --> 07:02.255
so anything's possible.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.356
Just remember...

07:03.356 --> 07:05.158
it's your day.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.159
I'll do that.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.160
Thanks, Cindy.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.129
Any problems,
you know where to find me.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.364
Now if you'll excuse me,

07:11.364 --> 07:13.199
I've got a man coming
to dredge the moat.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.535
( <i>laughs</i> )

07:16.903 --> 07:18.238
A moat?

07:18.238 --> 07:21.107
I'd like a moat!

07:25.979 --> 07:27.881
So what do you think?
They're great, huh?

07:27.881 --> 07:29.783
They're great.
Very heavy, very metal.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.217
So, uh, let's talk food.

07:31.217 --> 07:33.920
Now, a buffet is easier,
but a sit-down dinner

07:33.920 --> 07:35.188
is so much classier.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.024
And then there's the whole
"soup or salad" quandary.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.893
This would be so much easier
with a fairy godmother.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.463
Industry slang
for a wedding planner.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.698
Whatever you want.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.733
But, uh, what about the band?

07:46.733 --> 07:48.702
For the wedding?

07:48.702 --> 07:51.271
Well, if you think they can
handle <i>Sunrise, Sunset.</i>

07:51.271 --> 07:53.907
But I thought we agreed
to go a little nontraditional

07:53.907 --> 07:55.275
with the music,

07:55.275 --> 07:57.077
and that I could pick
the entertainment.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.178
But...

08:00.180 --> 08:01.815
All right, we did agree.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.016
They'll be fine.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.353
PRINCESS:
Hey!

08:06.353 --> 08:09.189
It's your special day, Sabrina.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.358
Insist on what you want.

08:13.259 --> 08:15.195
Actually, what I meant was,

08:15.195 --> 08:17.030
"No, they won't be fine."

08:17.030 --> 08:18.465
♪ ♪

08:40.053 --> 08:41.621
♪ ♪

09:09.949 --> 09:11.084
No, listen to me!

09:11.084 --> 09:13.353
I want doves,
and I want them
painted blue!

09:13.353 --> 09:15.422
Well, how long do
they live normally?

09:15.422 --> 09:17.624
I'm all for yelling
at service people,

09:17.624 --> 09:20.794
but when you make them cry,
they're useless for hours.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.962
Oh, quit your sniveling
and just get the job done!

09:22.962 --> 09:24.431
Morgan, I thought
you said you were

09:24.431 --> 09:26.332
going to help me
pick out tablecloth colors.

09:26.332 --> 09:27.534
Well, I got swatches

09:27.534 --> 09:30.003
but now that you're
going with <i>blue</i> doves,

09:30.003 --> 09:31.771
I'm not sure
if they're right.

09:31.771 --> 09:32.972
I ask for so little.

09:32.972 --> 09:34.374
Speaking of which, you!

09:34.374 --> 09:36.109
Where are you with our vows?

09:36.109 --> 09:38.711
I'm working on a draft,
but I may need to rewrite it.

09:38.711 --> 09:41.047
It's filled with words
like "love" and "compassion."

09:41.047 --> 09:43.783
I am surrounded
by incompetent people!

09:43.783 --> 09:45.452
Who are doing
the best they can.

09:45.452 --> 09:46.953
Why are you
acting like this?

09:46.953 --> 09:48.488
Yeah, we're
breaking our necks

09:48.488 --> 09:50.457
trying to help you
with your wedding.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.991
Well, breaking your necks
doesn't help me.

09:51.991 --> 09:52.992
Busting your butts would.

09:52.992 --> 09:55.061
I've seen you sweat more
looking for the remote.

09:55.061 --> 09:56.096
( <i>phone rings</i> )

09:56.096 --> 09:57.097
What?!

09:57.097 --> 09:58.731
No, no!
Unacceptable!

09:58.731 --> 10:03.069
Well, somebody's going
to have to rethink his
priorities, Reverend!

10:03.069 --> 10:04.771
You know,
I really think

10:04.771 --> 10:07.907
you should take the credit
for this shower.

10:07.907 --> 10:08.975
Like you said,

10:08.975 --> 10:11.578
you two are so much
closer friends.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.012
Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:13.012 --> 10:16.549
If anyone should be
the maid of honor, it's you.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.018
So I am just going
to step back,

10:19.018 --> 10:21.187
and let you
take the bullet.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.489
I mean credit.

10:22.489 --> 10:26.092
Hey!
Sabrina around?

10:26.092 --> 10:27.861
SABRINA:
Why am I even
speaking to you?

10:27.861 --> 10:28.862
Put the bishop on!

10:28.862 --> 10:30.763
Ah, there's the shrill cry
of my beloved now.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.134
So, when are you guys

10:34.134 --> 10:36.536
planning on getting
your own place?

10:36.536 --> 10:38.171
Look, I know that Sabrina's

10:38.171 --> 10:40.206
been acting
a little crazy lately,

10:40.206 --> 10:42.475
but maybe we should
cut her some slack.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.277
All brides get stressed out
like this

10:44.277 --> 10:45.645
before their wedding, right?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.014
Please say "Yes."

10:49.182 --> 10:50.416
Did you hear them?

10:50.416 --> 10:53.186
I mean is it too much
to ask for the perfect
storybook wedding?

10:53.186 --> 10:55.355
Sabrina,
I hate to say it,

10:55.355 --> 10:58.958
but you really
are turning into a monster.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.260
I am not a monster.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.629
I am a princess!

11:05.665 --> 11:07.400
( <i>coughing</i> )

11:07.400 --> 11:10.103
I stand corrected.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.672
( <i>coughs</i> )

11:18.144 --> 11:19.712
This dress is all wrong.

11:19.712 --> 11:22.982
Hey, Bridezilla,
take it down a notch.

11:22.982 --> 11:26.352
Listen, nobody asked you to come
down here, Mr. Nag-a-lot.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.222
WOMAN:
Is everything
okay in there?

11:29.222 --> 11:31.391
No, no, everything is not okay.

11:31.391 --> 11:34.827
( <i>rumbling</i> )

11:34.827 --> 11:36.663
What's going on?

11:36.663 --> 11:37.730
Oh...

11:37.730 --> 11:40.033
just another raging,
out-of-control bride

11:40.033 --> 11:42.535
preparing for
the happiest day of her life.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.204
( <i>growling and zapping</i> )

11:44.204 --> 11:45.305
Let's give her some space.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.706
Walk quickly,
don't look back.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.575
( <i>crashing and clattering</i> )

11:48.575 --> 11:50.410
Someone better get
in here and help me

11:50.410 --> 11:52.779
or nothing will grow in
this spot for 200 years.

11:52.779 --> 11:55.648
Look, before you destroy
the greater Boston area,

11:55.648 --> 11:58.051
you've got to listen to me
for two seconds.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.119
Quit your yammering
and grab a pin cushion.

12:00.119 --> 12:01.854
This dress isn't going
to size itself.

12:01.854 --> 12:04.123
Sabrina, forget the dress.

12:04.123 --> 12:05.592
Look at yourself.

12:05.592 --> 12:06.793
What?

12:06.793 --> 12:08.328
You have to imagine me
with my hair down

12:08.328 --> 12:09.629
but I still
look like a princess.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.297
But look around you.

12:11.297 --> 12:12.865
Look what you've done.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.236
Well, it's not my fault.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.404
I mean, I'm in a hurry

12:18.404 --> 12:19.906
and the service here
is terrible.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.674
Look under the dress.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.578
Oh, my feet!

12:25.578 --> 12:28.581
And... I've got a tail.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.184
And I'm leaving
destruction in my wake.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.218
Oh, my gosh.

12:32.218 --> 12:34.954
I'm not a princess,
I'm a dragon.

12:34.954 --> 12:36.422
Wake up, woman!

12:36.422 --> 12:39.058
You're not a princess,
you're a dragon!

12:39.058 --> 12:40.260
( <i>slapping</i> )

12:40.260 --> 12:41.661
I just said that.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.397
I know, I just always
wanted to do that.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.967
( <i>weak zapping</i> )

12:47.967 --> 12:48.968
Why won't it go away?

12:48.968 --> 12:50.303
Why is this happening to me?

12:50.303 --> 12:52.505
I mean, sure I was the
teensiest bit demanding,

12:52.505 --> 12:54.240
but you have to be
when you're planning

12:54.240 --> 12:55.708
the perfect
fairy-tale wedding.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.211
Besides, I was just following
Cinderella's advice.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.213
Well, that'll teach you
to listen to a woman

13:00.213 --> 13:01.781
who can't
keep track of her shoes.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.617
I've got to slip out of here
before anybody sees me.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.755
( <i>loud crash</i> )

13:08.755 --> 13:12.659
Oh, yeah, very discreet.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.996
Okay,

13:16.996 --> 13:19.032
made it across town
without anyone seeing me.

13:19.032 --> 13:22.035
Well, except for
those Japanese tourists.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.169
Yeah, that was unfortunate.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.204
Now all I need to do
is get up to my room,

13:25.204 --> 13:27.006
find Cinderella,
and get some answers.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.078
GROUP:
Surprise!

13:32.078 --> 13:33.813
Holy cheese
and crackers.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.081
Surprised?

13:35.081 --> 13:36.649
Surprised, shocked,
stunned, taken back.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.650
How's that? Got to go.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.785
You can't go.

13:38.785 --> 13:39.919
This is our way
of saying

13:39.919 --> 13:41.721
that even though you
treated us poorly,

13:41.721 --> 13:43.156
we are better
people than you.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.691
Enjoy your shower.

13:46.025 --> 13:46.959
MORGAN:
What was that?

13:46.959 --> 13:48.661
Nothing.
Just Kimmie being a klutz again.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.796
Now if you'll excuse me...

13:49.796 --> 13:51.664
Sabrina, why are you
wearing a wedding dress?

13:51.664 --> 13:52.732
Test-drive.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.068
The good news is,
it really holds the curves.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.235
ROXIE:
Sabrina, wait.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.939
Well, that is beyond rude.

13:59.939 --> 14:04.477
Now I don't feel so guilty
about regifting her.

14:04.477 --> 14:05.511
Sabrina?

14:05.511 --> 14:07.647
Ah, Aaron, um, hi.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.615
Shower's in there,
act surprised. Bye.

14:09.615 --> 14:10.717
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:10.717 --> 14:11.984
I think we need to have a... ow!

14:11.984 --> 14:13.753
Geez.

14:13.753 --> 14:14.987
What are you
wearing under there?

14:14.987 --> 14:15.988
Steel-toed boots?

14:15.988 --> 14:17.190
Of course.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.226
Would it kill you
to open a bridal magazine?

14:24.731 --> 14:29.035
Stupid feet, stupid tail,
stupid dress.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.370
SALEM:
Yeah, it took me
a while

14:30.370 --> 14:31.404
to get used
to my tail.

14:31.404 --> 14:34.807
But again, I have
no experience with,

14:34.807 --> 14:37.377
or fantasies
about, a dress.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.178
Cindy? Hello?

14:39.178 --> 14:40.513
Are you home?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.815
Oh, where could
she possibly be?

14:42.815 --> 14:45.184
Maybe she and Snow White
and Rapunzel

14:45.184 --> 14:46.519
are having a sleep-over.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.820
With pillow fights.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.722
Ooh, now that's
a fairy tale.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.090
Not helping.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.325
Not trying.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.993
( <i>thud and yell</i> )

14:53.993 --> 14:55.294
There may be an advantage

14:55.294 --> 14:56.596
to this thing after all.

14:56.596 --> 15:01.200
Like they say, a cat will
always land on his face.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.301
( <i>knocking</i> )

15:02.301 --> 15:03.770
AARON:
Sabrina, open up!

15:03.770 --> 15:04.804
We need to talk.

15:04.804 --> 15:05.972
Super busy.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.107
What's going on?

15:08.107 --> 15:09.809
She's barricaded
herself in there.

15:09.809 --> 15:10.977
Well, she better come out,

15:10.977 --> 15:12.145
'cause if I have
to sit down there

15:12.145 --> 15:15.248
with those loser friends
of hers, she has to, too.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.617
No offense!

15:17.617 --> 15:20.019
You know, Sabrina's quirky
behavior can be endearing,

15:20.019 --> 15:22.321
but I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.292
Sabrina, open up.

15:26.292 --> 15:28.394
Hold on, let me try.

15:28.394 --> 15:30.997
Sabrina, open up.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.965
It's all in the tone.

15:34.634 --> 15:35.902
Hello?

15:35.902 --> 15:37.003
Cindy, it's just me.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.738
Don't be freaked out
by the giant eyeball.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.073
Why don't you ring the doorbell?

15:41.073 --> 15:43.075
Well, if there was a doorbell,
don't you think I--

15:43.075 --> 15:44.444
Oh, look, a doorbell.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.645
( <i>doorbell chiming</i> )

15:46.879 --> 15:47.980
Oh, there you are.

15:47.980 --> 15:51.117
I've been wandering all over
this castle for 20 minutes.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.552
You know you have
a family of serfs

15:52.552 --> 15:53.753
squatting
in the root cellar?

15:53.753 --> 15:55.021
I told mom and the girls

15:55.021 --> 15:56.789
they should have been
nicer to me.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.623
So,

15:57.623 --> 15:59.358
how are the wedding plans going?

15:59.358 --> 16:01.461
Did you find a place
for the ceremony?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.162
Yeah, Jurassic Park.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.932
Look, I've become
tyrannosaurs-wreck.

16:07.366 --> 16:09.268
With the right train,
no one will notice.

16:09.268 --> 16:10.870
Let me show you the one I wore.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.139
It was gorgeous.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.474
I don't want
to hide the problem,

16:14.474 --> 16:15.508
I want to get rid of it.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.976
Aaron is very understanding,

16:16.976 --> 16:18.744
but I think
the six-foot kickstand

16:18.744 --> 16:20.046
might be a deal breaker.

16:20.046 --> 16:22.014
Well, then, you're better off
without him.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.484
I mean, Prince Charming
left years ago,

16:24.484 --> 16:26.352
but you don't see me crying.

16:26.352 --> 16:28.855
What? He left?

16:28.855 --> 16:31.390
But I thought you had
the perfect fairy-tale life.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.960
No, I had the perfect
fairy-tale wedding.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.262
Oh, I have to show you
pictures of the reception.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.732
( <i>Sabrina gasping</i> )

16:39.732 --> 16:42.301
Oh, my gosh,
you're a dragon, too.

16:42.301 --> 16:45.204
A small price to pay
for the perfect wedding day.

16:45.204 --> 16:46.506
This isn't what I want:

16:46.506 --> 16:49.008
Alone in a turret with
nothing but memories.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.511
What's funnier than
downtrodden townsfolk

16:51.511 --> 16:53.513
doing the Electric Slide?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.314
Why did I listen to you?

16:55.314 --> 16:57.016
I've been so focused
on the wedding

16:57.016 --> 16:59.085
I forgot all about
the happily ever after.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.187
I've got to go back,
refocus my priorities,

17:01.187 --> 17:03.389
and pay attention
to what's really important.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.658
Wow, I feel better already.

17:07.994 --> 17:10.396
You know, usually when
I have these revelations

17:10.396 --> 17:12.532
the magical side effects
tend to go away.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.101
Yo, I've learned my lesson.

17:15.101 --> 17:17.069
Any advice?

17:17.069 --> 17:19.338
Don't go with
the pumpkin carriage.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.541
You'll never
get rid of the smell.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.950
Salem, I'm going to be a dragon
for the rest of my life,

17:30.950 --> 17:32.351
and it's all my fault.

17:32.351 --> 17:34.253
Well, look at it
this way:

17:34.253 --> 17:36.255
You'll never have
to shave your legs again.

17:36.255 --> 17:39.592
No, because I'll have
to sandpaper them.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.728
Well, worry not,
my scaly maiden.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.331
I've done some research
and found the perfect solution.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.867
All you need to do
is find a prince to slay you.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.602
Where am I going to find
a prince?

17:49.602 --> 17:52.171
Well, I know a couple of queens
and a dog named Duke.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.675
( <i>thud and yell</i> )

17:55.675 --> 17:56.676
Oh, you're right.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.344
I am getting used to the tail.

17:58.344 --> 17:59.679
Sabrina?

17:59.679 --> 18:01.547
Oh, no,
you can't come in here.

18:01.547 --> 18:04.016
No, I'm coming in
and we're going
to talk,

18:04.016 --> 18:06.852
or this wedding
is off!

18:06.852 --> 18:09.255
But, Aaron, you can't see
the bride in her wedding dress.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.257
What? But I just saw you
downstairs.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.992
And we've had nothing
but bad luck ever since.

18:12.992 --> 18:13.926
Now, please don't look.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.261
Okay, fine, whatever.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.230
But I'm not leaving here
until we have this out.

18:18.230 --> 18:20.900
This wedding
is out of control.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.002
I know...
No, no, no, no, no!

18:23.002 --> 18:24.870
No, I don't want
to hear any more demands.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.272
All right?

18:26.272 --> 18:29.675
Look, Sabrina,
this isn't just your day,

18:29.675 --> 18:30.743
it's <i>our</i> day,

18:30.743 --> 18:32.578
and I'm going to have
some input.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.315
Wait, what did you just say?

18:36.315 --> 18:38.584
I'm saying that
this whole...

18:38.584 --> 18:41.253
fairy-tale wedding of yours
has gone too far.

18:41.253 --> 18:42.922
This is one Prince Charming

18:42.922 --> 18:44.824
that's not going
to put up with it anymore.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.761
Of course, you're my prince.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.897
No, not a prince,

18:51.897 --> 18:55.768
just a guy who wants to spend
the rest of his life with you.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.005
And I think you've lost sight
of that.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.873
I couldn't agree more.

19:03.275 --> 19:05.144
Really?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.278
Really.

19:07.546 --> 19:10.116
All I want is the
"happily ever after."

19:10.116 --> 19:12.151
Something else we agree on.

19:15.454 --> 19:16.589
Oh, just so you know:

19:16.589 --> 19:18.624
I'm okay with the tux,
but I'm not wearing tails.

19:18.624 --> 19:20.159
I'm right there with you.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.630
SABRINA:
Bye! Bye, Erin,
Bye, Kimmie,

19:24.630 --> 19:25.831
Bye, Maureen.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.233
We'll do this
again soon.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.035
Well, not for me, hopefully.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.770
For one of you, hopefully.

19:30.770 --> 19:34.173
Oh, that was absolutely perfect.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.042
I can't thank
you guys enough.

19:38.444 --> 19:39.712
Apparently,
I really can't.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.814
Guys, I said I'm sorry.

19:41.814 --> 19:42.848
Ooh, bathtub beads!

19:42.848 --> 19:44.316
Later, later!

19:47.920 --> 19:50.189
Look, I know you guys
went through a lot of trouble

19:50.189 --> 19:52.391
and I know I've been
a little bit demanding.

19:52.391 --> 19:54.593
Sabrina, you weren't
"a little" anything.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.295
You were a great big,
raging...

19:56.295 --> 19:57.363
Okay, I get it.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.998
Look, I'm really sorry.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.167
I can't even begin to explain.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.301
It's okay.

20:02.301 --> 20:03.602
Apology accepted.

20:03.602 --> 20:04.937
I know you're going
through a lot right now

20:04.937 --> 20:05.771
and I can't really
blame you

20:05.771 --> 20:07.440
for not being
yourself.

20:08.641 --> 20:09.742
( <i>clearing throat</i> )

20:09.742 --> 20:11.077
I can.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.380
But I won't.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.683
You know,
it really was a great shower.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.719
The finger sandwiches
were my idea.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.456
So, just curious:
have you given any thought

20:23.456 --> 20:26.325
to flower girls, bridesmaids,

20:26.325 --> 20:30.329
and, oh... I don't know...
maid of honor.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.531
Morgan, don't put
her on the spot.

20:32.531 --> 20:33.799
So have you?

20:33.799 --> 20:34.967
Well, I have thought
about it

20:34.967 --> 20:36.469
and I've decided
on my maid of honor.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.904
But I need to let you know
it's not going to be
one of you.

20:38.904 --> 20:39.905
Oh.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.540
Okay.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.843
It's going to be both of you.

20:43.843 --> 20:44.910
Great choice!

20:44.910 --> 20:46.378
We approve.

20:46.378 --> 20:49.548
But I'm really the main
maid of honor, right?

20:49.548 --> 20:51.617
You just couldn't
leave it alone,
could you?

20:51.617 --> 20:53.719
Well, it's not like...

20:55.421 --> 20:57.356
Nothing is ever simple.

21:05.564 --> 21:06.999
Yep, I'm definitely going
with something simpler

21:06.999 --> 21:08.434
and half the petticoats.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.769
Scaling back, huh?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.670
Please don't mention
scaly backs.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.606
Aaron and I are just finding
some middle ground.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.675
Instead of using the backyard,
we found a church we both like.

21:16.675 --> 21:18.744
But I can't believe
there's so much to do.

21:18.744 --> 21:21.213
So, if Tweedledum
and Tweedledumber

21:21.213 --> 21:24.784
are your maids of honor,
where does that leave me?

21:24.784 --> 21:26.352
You wanted to be
my maid of honor?

21:26.352 --> 21:28.287
It's always nice to be asked.
