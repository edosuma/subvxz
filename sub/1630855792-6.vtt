forest festival.

00:03.295 --> 00:05.921

sounds way better live

00:06.007 --> 00:07.339

added a drum?

00:09.301 --> 00:11.093
- What?
One guy on two drums?

00:11.178 --> 00:13.345
Too gimmicky.
They just lost a fan.

00:13.431 --> 00:15.556
- Forest fest
isn't about the music.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.516
It's about hooking up
with strangers.

00:17.601 --> 00:21.311

the "nymph" in "nymph."

about how to party.

The key is to--
- not walk in with you.

Good idea.
Bye.

a party guy, little bro.

00:31.282 --> 00:33.157
More of a party... Killer.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.491
Like, I kill for a living,

00:34.577 --> 00:37.119
And I get jealous
watching you murder a vibe.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.456

oh, look at him go, folks.

00:40.499 --> 00:43.042
Listen, I'm going in.
I wanna have sex with someone

00:43.085 --> 00:45.252

Hi.
I'm apparently a party killer.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.721
Just kidding.
I'm actually a king.

00:55.765 --> 00:57.139
You guys are lizards?

00:57.808 --> 00:59.099
Are you talking lizards?

00:59.185 --> 01:01.185
You're unable to talk?

01:01.187 --> 01:03.187
You just don't want
to talk to me.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.230
Wow, this is off
to a great freaking start.

01:05.316 --> 01:07.441
Nice forest.
It smells like dirt.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.111
- Thanks
for the disguise, darling.

01:11.197 --> 01:13.322
I love our son to death,
but he's party quicksand.

01:13.365 --> 01:15.324
- Shush! Don't call him
our son out loud.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.533
It lowers our party value.

01:16.619 --> 01:19.870

just turns into stuff

04:41.031 --> 04:42.322

is a human thing.
