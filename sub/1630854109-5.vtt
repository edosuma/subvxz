WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:08.842
<i>An incredible game today.</i>

00:08.942 --> 00:11.912
<i>Waipi'o's up four,
but Kawela is driving.</i>

00:12.012 --> 00:14.282
<i>All eyes on Titus Ioane,
who's miraculously</i>

00:14.382 --> 00:17.451
<i>gotten his team this far.</i>
Check 2!

00:17.551 --> 00:20.254
38!
<i>Ball on the 35.</i>

00:20.354 --> 00:21.522
Hike!

00:21.622 --> 00:25.093
<i>Ioane looking downfield.</i>

00:25.193 --> 00:27.361
<i>Has an open receiver.
It's caught!</i>

00:27.461 --> 00:29.097
<i>A clutch throw by Ioane.</i>

00:29.197 --> 00:31.065
Get set, get set!

00:31.165 --> 00:32.766
Watch the rush.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.468
<i>With scouts from every</i>

00:34.568 --> 00:36.437
<i>conference watching, these next</i>

00:36.537 --> 00:39.540
ten seconds will determine
this young man's destiny.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.610
<i>Ioane takes the ball himself.</i>

00:42.710 --> 00:45.679
<i>Heads to the house,
and he is in!</i>

00:45.779 --> 00:47.515
<i>Touchdown!</i>

00:47.615 --> 00:49.450
<i>Kawela wins!</i>
What?!

00:49.550 --> 00:51.452
Come on!

00:54.488 --> 00:56.857
All right! All right!

00:56.957 --> 00:58.392
Whoo!

01:23.417 --> 01:24.952
Can't find my gym bag.

01:25.052 --> 01:26.687
Uh, left of the couch,
under the side table. Oh.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.989
Amazing. Now I need my...
Water bottle.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.724
Yeah, but with the...
Electrolyte water.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.393
Don't want you passing out
on the second hill.

01:32.493 --> 01:36.096
Thank you. Oh, can you hand me
that stuff from the counter?

01:36.197 --> 01:38.031
New case?
New lease.

01:38.132 --> 01:39.833
For your apartment?

01:39.933 --> 01:42.303
Oh, no, landlord's
selling my place.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.872
And you already found a new one?

01:44.972 --> 01:46.974
You got to move quick
in the rental biz.

01:47.074 --> 01:50.144
It's not great, but,
on the plus side,

01:50.244 --> 01:51.745
it's also too expensive.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.348
Where's my phone?

01:54.448 --> 01:55.916
How long have you
been looking?

01:56.016 --> 01:58.452
I had it this morning.
For a-an apartment.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.521
Uh, a couple weeks.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.955
Everything okay?

02:02.055 --> 02:04.392
I had
no idea this was happening.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.527
A-And I just want to,
you know,

02:06.627 --> 02:07.861
be sure you did
your due diligence.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.863
Find something that suits
your lifestyle.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.966
The lifestyle of an NCIS agent
whose whole life

02:13.066 --> 02:14.735
is work, gym, and you?

02:14.835 --> 02:16.036
Yeah.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.839
I mean, you're-you're here
all the time.

02:18.939 --> 02:21.074
I am.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.414
So...

02:27.448 --> 02:30.751
So, you should use me for this.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.253
What's your budget?
What's on your must list?

02:32.353 --> 02:34.188
What's a deal breaker?
You shouldn't worry about it.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.390
I'm not worried. It's fun.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.560
Okay. If you want.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.161
I do. Great.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.396
Awesome.
Uh-huh.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.631
Phone is in your pocket,
by the way.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.900
Oh. Yay. Thank you.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.203
Amazing. Um...

02:49.303 --> 02:50.804
Great.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.680
Brings back memories.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.515
Stadium or the
crime scene?

03:01.615 --> 03:03.917
Well, both.
Taking down bad guys

03:04.017 --> 03:06.787
like taking down running backs
in high school.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.290
Mr. All-State thinking
about a comeback?

03:09.390 --> 03:12.760
Ah, no. My body hurts just
looking at a football field.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.695
And Jake, he won't even
look at a football.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.597
I mean, it's all soccer
all the time.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.898
Heartbreaking.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.500
Yeah, Daniel tried
to get Alex, too,

03:19.600 --> 03:21.935
but baseball
was in his blood.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.504
Speaking of...

03:25.473 --> 03:27.775
Victim is Petty Officer
Ben Ioane,

03:27.875 --> 03:30.244
stationed at Pendleton,
but originally from the island.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.212
His brother is...
Titus Ioane,

03:32.313 --> 03:33.381
Kawela's quarterback.

03:33.481 --> 03:34.948
When your ex

03:35.048 --> 03:37.718
is a football coach,
these kids are household names.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.688
Titus could be the next
Tua Tagovailoa.

03:40.788 --> 03:43.190
Talented family.
File says Ben was a former

03:43.291 --> 03:45.092
high school football star
in his own right.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.528
Kept Daniel's team out of the
playoffs three years in a row.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.731
About 20 minutes after the game,

03:50.831 --> 03:52.433
he fell from
up there.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.503
Fall, or
was he pushed?

03:57.204 --> 03:58.306
Look how far out he is

03:58.406 --> 04:01.241
from the walkway.
Someone gave him a hand.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.344
Learn what you can about Ben.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.579
I'm gonna go talk to the family.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.856
Orchid for
condolences?

04:15.956 --> 04:18.692
Never come
empty-handed.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.194
I grew up like this.
Good people,

04:21.295 --> 04:24.865
not a lot of opportunities,
but if you can play ball...

04:24.965 --> 04:26.800
Changes everything. Yeah.

04:26.900 --> 04:30.003
For people here,
it's all about <i>Fa'a Samoa,</i>

04:30.103 --> 04:31.372
Samoan Way,

04:31.472 --> 04:34.508
so your touchdown is your
entire family's touchdown,

04:34.608 --> 04:36.276
and your success is
the community's success.

04:37.545 --> 04:40.213
Your loss is felt by everyone.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.320
Hello. Special Agents
Tennant and Holman,

04:46.420 --> 04:47.855
NCIS.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.924
We'd like to offer our
condolences to the Ioane family.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.232
Titus.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.902
Jane Tennant, NCIS.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.904
Sorry to hear
about your brother.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.373
He was
a great player,

05:05.473 --> 05:07.307
and I hear
a great sailor, too.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.309
Tennant?

05:09.410 --> 05:11.044
Like the coach
from St. Lawrence?

05:11.144 --> 05:13.013
That's my ex,

05:13.113 --> 05:15.616
but I'm actually here
to talk about

05:15.716 --> 05:17.250
what happened to Ben.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.553
Do you know what happened?

05:19.653 --> 05:21.789
Well, we're still
gathering information,

05:21.889 --> 05:23.857
but it's why I need
to ask you a few questions,

05:23.957 --> 05:25.225
if you're up for it.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.196
Do you know why Ben
came back to the island?

05:29.296 --> 05:31.098
Came to see me play.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.166
And when was the last time
you saw him?

05:33.266 --> 05:35.035
Couple days ago.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.672
He told me to beat
Waipi'o's ass,

05:38.772 --> 05:40.708
just like he did
when he was in school.

05:40.808 --> 05:44.011
I just wanted
to make him proud, you know?

05:44.111 --> 05:47.114
Since he's been gone
for so long.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.784
Listen, I know this is hard.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.823
Did Ben have problems
with anyone?

05:55.923 --> 05:57.758
Hey, Titus.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.860
Champions no cry.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.195
Not crying, <i>Tama.</i>

06:02.295 --> 06:04.865
So, my brother tells me
you came with flowers,

06:04.965 --> 06:06.534
but you also came as cops.

06:06.634 --> 06:09.837
We're just trying to figure out
what happened to your son.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.039
We don't know nothing, brah,

06:12.139 --> 06:14.542
and Ben wasn't part
of this <i>'ohana</i> anymore.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.309
Why's that?

06:16.410 --> 06:18.812
It's personal.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.014
Did you see your son
before he died?

06:21.114 --> 06:22.716
I haven't seen him
since he left this island.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.318
Mr. Ioane...
My family

06:25.419 --> 06:28.656
needs space.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.191
So, you go now.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.030
Heads up.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.333
Little low, Ern.
Think I was Lucy?

06:40.434 --> 06:41.902
Not with that
lumbering gait.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.604
Lucy's got a
cornerback's bearing.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.238
Speed, agility,
quick on the turn.

06:45.338 --> 06:48.576
Well, I actually played
cornerback, so joke's on you.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.143
Joke might be on all of us.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.780
Tennant and Kai got stonewalled
by Ioane's family.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.715
Lucy talked
to his C.O.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.684
Ioane was supposedly
squared away.

06:56.784 --> 06:57.751
Kid shows up
on the island

06:57.851 --> 06:59.887
after being gone for years.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.823
A few days later,
he's tossed off the bleachers.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.057
There's more.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.325
Yeah.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.228
I checked his flight
and credit cards.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.297
Been here a week.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.632
Stayed at a hotel.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.567
Makes sense since
his dad disowned him.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.736
So, what did he do
during the week?

07:15.836 --> 07:18.939
Ah, I don't know what he did,
but I do know where he did it.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.041
I tracked Ben's
rental car GPS.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.544
After he left the hotel,
he went here.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.213
Construction site?

07:26.313 --> 07:29.182
Owned by Max and Inu Koa.
Big in building,

07:29.282 --> 07:31.552
but bigger in racketeering,
extortion and fraud.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.787
You thinking Ben was in bed
with criminals?

07:33.887 --> 07:36.023
Thinking we might
want to check it out.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.025
I'll call Kai
and Lucy.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.426
Heads up.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.136
There's a lot of construction
on the island.

07:49.236 --> 07:53.073
Yet the rent's always sky-high.
Can't find anything decent.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.975
What, you looking
for a place?

07:55.075 --> 07:58.178
Found it.
At least, I think. Oh.

07:58.278 --> 08:01.214
Whistler's seeing if she can
get me a better deal.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.550
Oh, that's nice.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.117
I guess so.

08:04.217 --> 08:07.154
Says she wants to help,
but there's something more.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.622
Well, you're a
trained investigator,

08:08.722 --> 08:10.257
and you're not sure why
your FBI girlfriend's

08:10.357 --> 08:11.725
helping you look
for apartments.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.327
She's being pretty
cagey about it.

08:14.427 --> 08:17.030
Yeah, like literally
everyone here.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.066
We're making a scene.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.602
Who should we start with?
Go the source.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.070
Koas are going in.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.471
Looking for someone?

08:24.572 --> 08:26.740
Yeah, Koa brothers. Sorry.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.576
Not here.

08:28.676 --> 08:29.843
We just saw them
go inside.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.211
You're mistaken.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.814
And this is
private property.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.983
We're federal agents.
We don't care.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.484
You need to leave.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.386
Yeah, why is that?

08:39.486 --> 08:41.789
Safety hazard.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.457
You do know what
federal agent means, right?

08:44.558 --> 08:45.726
Law enforcement.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.094
You're not allowed
to threaten us.

08:47.194 --> 08:51.231
No threat. Just leave.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.902
Now.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.336
Kai Holman.

08:56.436 --> 08:59.239
Always got to make
an entrance, huh.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.741
AJ.

09:00.841 --> 09:01.875
You two know each other?

09:01.975 --> 09:03.777
Eh. We're <i>hoaloha.</i>

09:03.877 --> 09:05.613
Let's take
a cleansing breath,

09:05.713 --> 09:08.081
yeah?

09:10.984 --> 09:13.386
They were just leaving.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.132
Who's AJ?

09:25.232 --> 09:27.200
It's just someone
I used to know.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.470
This was a waste
of a trip.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.972
Maybe not.

09:45.518 --> 09:46.987
Maleko Ioane.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.023
We need to talk.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.303
You thirsty?
No.

10:03.403 --> 10:06.206
Okay.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.676
A sandwich? Some coffee?

10:08.776 --> 10:10.577
Brah, you come
to my house uninvited,

10:10.678 --> 10:12.312
then you drag me
down here from work,

10:12.412 --> 10:13.480
for what?

10:13.580 --> 10:15.548
Offer me a snack?

10:15.649 --> 10:17.017
We just want to talk.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.887
What were you doing
at the Koa brothers' site?

10:19.987 --> 10:22.589
They subcontract
my concrete company.

10:22.690 --> 10:25.058
So what?
Is that a crime?

10:25.158 --> 10:26.593
No.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.095
Lying to a federal agent is.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.732
You told us you hadn't
seen Ben, but he came

10:31.832 --> 10:33.667
to your worksite
several times last week.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.402
Must've missed him.

10:35.502 --> 10:36.837
Mr. Ioane.

10:37.771 --> 10:40.107
Why wouldn't you talk
to your son?

10:44.812 --> 10:47.948
We're here to solve
your son's murder.

10:50.050 --> 10:54.121
Boy was to play in the Big Ten.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.890
Could've gone pro.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.928
Could've changed the future
of our <i>'ohana.</i>

11:02.495 --> 11:03.964
But he squandered it.

11:04.932 --> 11:07.167
The day after the
championship game,

11:07.267 --> 11:08.535
he took off,

11:08.635 --> 11:11.705
just like that.
Never say nothing.

11:11.805 --> 11:15.475
I had to find out
from the school

11:15.575 --> 11:18.712
that he signed his life away.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.049
He wanted to serve.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.017
He wanted to run.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.518
Okay.

11:25.618 --> 11:26.887
Run from what?

11:26.987 --> 11:29.556
The Koa brothers?
Brah.

11:29.656 --> 11:31.825
Those are just my bosses.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.161
Ben came back home.

11:34.261 --> 11:37.197
He came to your work,
several times.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.633
And then, he got tossed
from the bleachers.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.203
You got to
tell us why.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.505
I don't know.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.574
Maybe he wanted to be a hero.

11:47.674 --> 11:50.243
What does that mean?

11:50.343 --> 11:52.645
Ben wanting to be a hero?

11:54.014 --> 11:56.950
What do the Koa brothers
have on your family?

11:58.485 --> 12:00.821
You got to want justice.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.425
All I want

12:05.525 --> 12:07.961
is to go back

12:08.061 --> 12:09.830
to work.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.232
<i>It's the Koas.</i>

12:12.332 --> 12:14.501
That's the reason
Maleko's staying quiet.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.170
Just how bad are these guys?
Bad.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.973
As in,
"bury you in cement

12:20.073 --> 12:21.775
and run you over with
a bulldozer" bad.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.977
Not that they've ever been
convicted of murder.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.080
Inu and Max Koa
have only served time

12:27.180 --> 12:29.116
for aggravated assault,
weapons possession,

12:29.216 --> 12:30.183
and extortion.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.885
So, they're thugs.
Big-time.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.087
Attacked a driver
in a road rage incident

12:34.187 --> 12:35.555
and the cop
who came to intervene.

12:35.655 --> 12:38.758
But here's the thing.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.693
In the last few years,

12:40.794 --> 12:42.695
they blossomed.
Turned their

12:42.796 --> 12:46.033
lo-fi blood money operation
into real estate.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.870
So, not just land,
businesses, too.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.840
Restaurants, nail salons,
a small hotel,

12:52.940 --> 12:54.942
all with Koa names on the LLCs,

12:55.042 --> 12:56.910
not to mention owning a piece
of every contractor

12:57.010 --> 13:00.047
they work with,
including Maleko Ioane.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.184
Hey, we know
that guy, too.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.490
It's just, uh, someone
from the old days.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.059
There more to that?

13:12.159 --> 13:14.261
I'm not sure if it's worth
pursuing just yet.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.097
So Ben was trying

13:17.197 --> 13:19.466
to stop the Koas
from extorting his dad?

13:19.566 --> 13:20.467
Mm, hard to say.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.635
Tracking the Koas is like

13:22.735 --> 13:24.771
following the branches
of a banyan tree.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.706
So, we skip the branches,

13:26.806 --> 13:28.308
go right to the root.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.378
Lucy, tomorrow, you and me
are gonna meet the Koa brothers.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.714
Uh, they didn't really like it
when Kai and I dropped by.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.017
That's 'cause you didn't
bring a present.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.352
'Cause you didn't
bring a present.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.197
This is the HQ
of a sophisticated

13:50.297 --> 13:51.531
criminal enterprise?

13:51.631 --> 13:54.834
Books, covers, judgment.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.937
You know what
I'm gonna say.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.212
NCIS, right?

14:10.183 --> 14:12.252
You have a moment for us?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.054
Come on in.

14:19.259 --> 14:22.462
Want to apologize for how
our boys was acting earlier.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.231
They get
a little, uh,

14:24.331 --> 14:26.099
protective at work.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.002
Yeah, it's a
safety hazard, so...

14:29.102 --> 14:30.470
they just don't want
anyone to get hurt.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.340
What are you building here?
It's a rec center

14:33.440 --> 14:34.807
for the community.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.610
Least welcoming rec center
I've ever been to.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.612
What can we do for you?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.348
Ben Ioane.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.651
It's a tragedy.

14:44.751 --> 14:47.220
Planning to name the rec center
in his honor,

14:47.320 --> 14:48.555
hometown hero.

14:48.655 --> 14:51.591
He visited this building site
three times

14:51.691 --> 14:53.193
in the days before his death.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.362
Benny hasn't been back
since he enlisted,

14:55.462 --> 14:58.765
but he stayed connected
with the community.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.267
Just wanted to see
what we were doing.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.269
That's not what we heard.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.738
Ben basically
cut ties.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.774
That's not our experience.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.711
You close with
the Ioane family?

15:12.845 --> 15:15.382
What makes you ask that?

15:15.482 --> 15:16.984
Titus is on your wall here.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.685
Close with a lot of folks.

15:18.785 --> 15:22.555
Try to support local events.
Clubs, schools, sports.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.191
Yeah, feels good giving back.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.825
That why you own a stake
in all the contractors

15:25.925 --> 15:28.661
who work for you?
Including Maleko Ioane?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.697
Sure.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.132
What else would it be?

15:32.232 --> 15:34.734
Could be that you force them
to work for you

15:34.834 --> 15:36.336
and take advantage of them.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.705
Just like all the businesses
you bought up in the area.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.073
Use them to launder money.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.674
That would be illegal.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.876
It sure would.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.281
Well, thank you for your time.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.555
That's it?

15:55.655 --> 15:56.956
What'd you expect?

15:57.057 --> 15:58.058
I don't know.
Putting the screws to them.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.592
They're never
gonna talk.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.928
Then what was the point?
They didn't even say anything.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.796
No, but they showed us
what we needed.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.398
The photos?
Look,

16:05.498 --> 16:07.467
we know the Koas are extorting
the local community.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.636
Titus had a place of honor

16:09.736 --> 16:11.438
on that wall.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.041
Let's find out how deep
their tendrils go.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.182
Hey.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.983
Thanks for taking
the time, Daniel.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.386
More girlfriend
trouble with Alex?

16:26.486 --> 16:30.090
No. Well, yes. But later.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.059
This is about
Titus Ioane.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.827
Ah, heard about
his brother.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.563
So sad.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.166
If you're asking about it, I'm
guessing it wasn't an accident.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.600
No, and

16:40.700 --> 16:42.469
everything seems to be swirling
around the Koa Brothers.

16:42.569 --> 16:43.770
You know them?

16:43.870 --> 16:45.405
Everyone knows them.
They sponsor

16:45.505 --> 16:47.940
a lot of football events,
throw money around.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.742
They like to be close
to the star players.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.545
Like Titus?
And Ben before.

16:52.645 --> 16:53.880
Why?

16:53.980 --> 16:55.848
These kids,
they got nothing.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.550
Can barely afford
decent gear,

16:57.650 --> 16:59.852
let alone the camps
and the offseason trainings.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.588
If a kid
shows promise,

17:01.688 --> 17:03.990
people step in,
help out.

17:04.091 --> 17:06.226
Out of the kindness
of their hearts?

17:06.326 --> 17:07.994
What do
you think?

17:08.095 --> 17:10.363
I don't know what to think.
All I know is

17:10.463 --> 17:12.432
you coached Titus
at summer QB camp,

17:12.532 --> 17:15.435
and I am having a really
hard time connecting with him.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.270
I can reach out.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.307
I might take you
up on that.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.442
Thanks, Daniel.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.881
No blemishes. It looks good.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.487
It sounds fine.

17:34.587 --> 17:37.457
Been gone from the restaurant
too long. Lost your edge.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.726
Yeah, you've been there
for, like, a year, so

17:39.826 --> 17:41.528
you're not the
<i>kalo</i> whisperer.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.963
I have a gift.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.266
Don't hate, and

17:46.366 --> 17:47.867
don't tell me
you come all this way

17:47.967 --> 17:50.002
to listen
to vegetables.

17:50.103 --> 17:53.506
I, uh, I ran
into AJ Hale.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.108
You remember him?

17:55.208 --> 17:56.943
Wish I could forget.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.911
Half of high school
was listening

17:59.011 --> 18:01.581
to Leila talk
about his eyes.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.183
Wahine love
a bad boy.

18:03.283 --> 18:06.686
Yeah, I don't remember that
being his reputation.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.688
That's 'cause
yours was worse.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.123
Ah.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.524
What else do you
know about him?

18:11.624 --> 18:13.593
He's not center field
for the Yankees.

18:13.693 --> 18:14.727
That much I know.

18:14.827 --> 18:15.962
I think he's working construction.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.897
Yeah. I may have
heard that.

18:17.997 --> 18:21.368
May have? Come on, Hina.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.538
Oh, I know.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.407
Here's what's up,

18:27.507 --> 18:30.910
why don't you
ask him yourself?

18:31.978 --> 18:34.181
I haven't talked to him
in years. I...

18:34.281 --> 18:35.582
Look, I don't really
want to open up

18:35.682 --> 18:36.583
that part of my life again.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.018
Stop being dramatic.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.188
You were like
best friends.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.491
I'm sure you can
figure it out.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.461
Just thinking of your reaction
when I came back to town.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.563
AJ don't have
my right hook.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.098
You'll be fine.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.308
Have a sec?

19:02.309 --> 19:04.811
Just trying to figure out
how a bakery, a tackle store,

19:04.911 --> 19:07.647
and a tour company are all
being used for racketeering.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.149
I might have some ideas.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.885
All in the right area,
similar price range,

19:12.985 --> 19:14.854
utilities included.

19:14.954 --> 19:18.791
And now I know we're not
talking about the Koa brothers.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.327
No. Your living arrangements.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.361
Right.
'Cause you're moving.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.895
Mm-hmm.
I'm not done.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.464
I expanded
the radius, too,

19:24.564 --> 19:27.166
considered you-you really like
the washer-dryer at my place,

19:27.267 --> 19:28.935
and the balcony,
and the location,

19:29.035 --> 19:30.670
of course. You know,
just a few minutes

19:30.770 --> 19:32.605
from work.
I could just move in with you.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.177
Kidding. I did not
want to force...

19:38.278 --> 19:40.179
Actually, I...

19:40.280 --> 19:41.681
I kind of thought the same.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.584
Well, you already spend
most nights at my place.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.918
I know.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.354
And that's not gonna
change any time soon.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.322
No.
So, who are we fooling?

19:49.422 --> 19:51.924
Right?
It's the financially
responsible thing to do.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.760
It is the what now?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.862
It's...

19:55.962 --> 19:57.464
it's the rational decision.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.432
Right.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.001
And we should do this
because it's...

20:02.101 --> 20:03.336
rational.

20:03.436 --> 20:06.673
Hey, Luce.
Got to see Ern...

20:08.308 --> 20:10.343
...by myself.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.281
Uh... I should go back to...

20:14.381 --> 20:16.683
Yeah. Lots to think about.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.256
Heads up.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.857
Oh. Think I was Kai?

20:24.957 --> 20:26.426
I stand by
my gait comment.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.995
I-I'm just not hip
to the spiral yet.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.630
My sport was water polo.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.998
Hey, did you find
any connection between

20:32.098 --> 20:33.366
the Koas
and local football?

20:33.466 --> 20:34.767
Ah. See for yourself.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.171
I combed the Koas'
sponsorship records.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.207
They take an active
interest in athletes,

20:41.308 --> 20:42.309
couple dozen over
the last few years,

20:42.409 --> 20:44.511
including this guy.

20:44.611 --> 20:45.678
Who's he?

20:45.778 --> 20:48.281
Ricky Sio,
star defensive tackle,

20:48.381 --> 20:49.849
All-Hawaii two years running,

20:49.949 --> 20:52.552
and was NFL-bound until
a knee injury derailed him.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.887
Served three years
for ag assault in Cali.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.556
Came back home
a few years ago.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.892
Paystubs all from the Koa
brothers construction projects.

20:59.992 --> 21:02.295
Sad story.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.963
How is he connected
to Ben Ioane?

21:04.063 --> 21:06.633
They were rivals in high school.
Played against each other.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.568
That's a long-shot motive
for murder.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.970
Hey, motive is
for investigators.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.305
I follow the facts.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.140
The fact is,
Ricky Sio

21:14.240 --> 21:17.644
was one row behind Ben
at the championship game.

21:20.179 --> 21:23.716
So, we better
go pay him a visit.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.890
I don't get it, Luce.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.325
You want to stay
at Whistler's?

21:32.425 --> 21:33.993
Yeah, it's awesome.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.895
And she wants you
to stay there?

21:35.995 --> 21:37.430
That's what
she said.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.165
So, what's
the problem?

21:39.265 --> 21:41.401
She said it was
a practical solution

21:41.501 --> 21:43.770
from a financial perspective.

21:44.737 --> 21:48.341
And you wanted her to say
that it was for love?

21:48.441 --> 21:50.443
And you just made it weird.

21:50.543 --> 21:53.746
Over there.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.149
Hey, Ricky Sio.

21:57.249 --> 21:58.951
We got some questions for you,
if you don't mind.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.424
Luce!

22:04.524 --> 22:06.726
Okay, we'll do it your way.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.035
Sio!

22:29.749 --> 22:31.418
Ricky Sio.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.155
I heard about you growing up.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.592
You were a big star.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.194
God blessed you,
everyone said.

22:42.294 --> 22:43.630
Football warrior.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.666
Man, you were gonna
be famous, go pro.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.101
Hawai'i's top prospect.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.603
I was good.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.938
Meh.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.640
People hype up
football players so much.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.141
Everyone's the next Polamalu.

22:55.241 --> 22:57.577
Brah,

22:57.677 --> 23:00.279
I was a beast.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.448
He was.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.315
But not better than Ben Ioane.

23:03.416 --> 23:06.786
I sacked Ben's ass three times
at the championship game.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.421
I owned him.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.657
Is that what the two of y'all
were talking about at

23:10.757 --> 23:12.291
Titus's game? You owning him?

23:12.391 --> 23:13.660
That's ancient history.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.762
But you did talk.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.966
Explain what's happening here.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.200
Nothing.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.269
Well, nothing
isn't why Ben's dead.

23:23.369 --> 23:26.839
And it's not why you attacked
two federal agents.

23:32.011 --> 23:34.814
All I ever wanted
was to play football.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.784
Then one tackle,

23:37.884 --> 23:39.986
knee bends the wrong way,

23:40.086 --> 23:42.388
everything disappears,

23:42.489 --> 23:45.257
just like that.
And then there's Ben.

23:45.357 --> 23:47.359
He gave it up by choice.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.895
Turns his back
on a future.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.063
On tradition.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.367
That makes you throw a guy
over the bleachers?

23:58.805 --> 24:00.406
Yeah.

24:04.577 --> 24:07.914
Yeah, you admit
to killing Ben Ioane?

24:08.014 --> 24:11.050
Sunday. At the
Aloha Championship.

24:11.150 --> 24:14.153
It's the Koa brothers, right?
They put you up to it.

24:14.253 --> 24:15.354
No.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.691
Just me. I did it alone.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.126
Why?

24:20.226 --> 24:22.629
Why would you kill
Ben Ioane?

24:22.729 --> 24:24.831
It's not about tradition.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.868
Why not?

24:39.812 --> 24:42.448
AJ, brought refreshments.

24:42.549 --> 24:43.850
Boom kanani!

24:43.950 --> 24:46.753
Here comes my ghost man
with the green bottles.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.355
Hey, Jordan. Thanks, eh.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.860
Kai Hoe-man.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.363
I don't miss
that nickname.

24:57.463 --> 24:59.899
<i>Hanabaddah</i> days we used to get
into a lot of mischief, yeah?

24:59.999 --> 25:01.601
Yeah, a long time ago.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.903
Yeah. You know,
I heard you was back in town.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.673
Didn't believe
till the other day.

25:06.773 --> 25:08.307
Yeah. Hey,
about that...

25:08.407 --> 25:09.842
Hey, you want to meet
the family?

25:09.942 --> 25:11.510
My wife and daughter
barely believe

25:11.611 --> 25:13.780
you exist.
I do, I do, I...

25:13.880 --> 25:15.281
I was just
hoping to talk.

25:15.381 --> 25:18.484
Oh, that's your
serious face.

25:18.585 --> 25:21.087
Kind of like when you
used to take the mound.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.889
Yeah, it's important.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.824
'Cause you're
a Navy cop now.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.226
Yeah, that's right.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.061
And you're working
for the Koa brothers.

25:29.161 --> 25:33.132
In construction,
not the other stuff.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.335
You're plenty <i>akamai,</i> AJ.

25:36.435 --> 25:38.938
You know that other stuff
is everywhere.

25:39.972 --> 25:43.342
Checks clear,
I-I pay my taxes.

25:43.442 --> 25:45.878
Besides, I saved
your butt yesterday,

25:45.978 --> 25:47.847
so you're welcome.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.016
No joke, AJ,
Koas are responsible

25:50.116 --> 25:52.685
for Ben Ioane's death.
Not how I heard it.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.286
People say you got
Ricky Sio in cuffs.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.856
People say
a lot of things.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.625
What happened to you?

26:00.226 --> 26:03.062
You know, I could ask you
the same question.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.497
You were supposed to be
wearing those pinstripes.

26:05.598 --> 26:07.767
Got in trouble.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.702
Stupid stuff.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.704
Lost my scholarship.
Had to find a job.

26:11.804 --> 26:12.872
Yeah, but the Koas?

26:12.972 --> 26:14.273
Honest work.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.943
Building something
for the community, giving back.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.778
They're extorting
the community,

26:18.878 --> 26:20.379
and they had Ricky Sio

26:20.479 --> 26:21.814
murder Ben Ioane.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.616
AJ, we made it, bruddah.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.652
Howzit?

26:26.585 --> 26:29.121
You know it's risky for me
to even be seen with you, right?

26:29.221 --> 26:32.859
Ben's family is tied with
the Koas, and we don't know why.

26:32.959 --> 26:35.594
But it cost Ben
his life.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.630
You need to help. Okay.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.932
Okay, I-I hear you.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.401
Look, I want to help,
I do, I just...

26:42.501 --> 26:44.236
Let me think about it.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.072
The Koas have eyes everywhere.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.040
If they even hear anyone's
talking about it...

26:48.140 --> 26:50.910
May already
be too late.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.052
Hey. Did the Koas do this?

27:00.152 --> 27:02.188
<i>Tama...</i>
Hey, kid.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.956
Don't you dare
say a word.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.057
But <i>Tama.</i> Shh.

27:05.157 --> 27:06.693
I need you
to talk to me, okay?

27:06.793 --> 27:08.127
They did this to you.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.929
No, they didn't do it.
You did it.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.864
You, Ben,

27:11.964 --> 27:14.867
everybody who couldn't keep
their nose out of my business.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.804
You've ruined
my family.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.144
I'm sorry.
Let's go.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.391
The Koas kill his son,
destroy his business,

27:39.491 --> 27:41.427
and Maleko still won't talk?

27:41.527 --> 27:43.295
The Koas' hold is too strong.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.797
But why?

27:44.897 --> 27:48.167
Maleko's a cement mason,
Ben was a sailor, not criminals.

27:48.267 --> 27:49.568
Ah, we're missing something.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.371
AJ give you any insight at all?

27:52.471 --> 27:54.673
No, he's afraid to.

27:54.774 --> 27:55.975
He says he has to
think about it,

27:56.075 --> 27:57.777
but Titus,
Titus wanted to talk.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.645
He just won't say a word
in front of his dad.

27:59.746 --> 28:02.148
Think I can help.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.888
Hey. Yeah, it's me.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.590
Look, I think
it's time to talk to him.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.559
Step into it.

28:13.659 --> 28:15.694
Nice. Hut.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.998
Strong, strong, strong, strong.

28:20.066 --> 28:22.701
Hey, take a knee. We'll, uh,
pick the drills up later.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.771
You got it, Coach.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.105
Hey, Jane.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.406
How's he doing?

28:27.506 --> 28:30.676
He wants to talk,
but he's scared.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.511
Koas have that effect
on people.

28:32.611 --> 28:34.781
It's not the Koas.
It's his dad.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.715
He doesn't want
to betray the family.

28:38.284 --> 28:40.586
Silence cost his family
too much already.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.254
Well, I'm not the one
you need to convince.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.265
How're the drills?

28:53.365 --> 28:54.566
Good.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.202
Football's what
comes natural,

28:56.302 --> 28:59.071
I guess.
Helps to have
something else to focus on.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.373
Coach Tennant says
being a quarterback

29:01.473 --> 29:04.010
isn't about having
a strong arm,

29:04.110 --> 29:05.344
but a strong mind.

29:05.444 --> 29:08.380
"To be a leader, you got
to make hard choices."

29:08.480 --> 29:09.615
Daniel says that, too.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.719
Being a leader
isn't easy,

29:13.820 --> 29:16.722
but you got to try
to do the right thing,

29:16.823 --> 29:19.558
even if your dad
doesn't want you to.

29:19.658 --> 29:22.261
My <i>tama</i> wants
to protect me.

29:23.695 --> 29:25.998
But being silent
got Ben killed.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.334
What did the Koas want
with your brother?

29:28.434 --> 29:30.702
Nothing.

29:30.803 --> 29:32.071
They want me.

29:32.171 --> 29:35.141
Junior high,
they saw me play,

29:35.241 --> 29:38.878
offered to help
with training, equipment.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.848
My dad was out of work,
so they bought him a truck.

29:41.948 --> 29:44.416
They gave him a job.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.752
But nothing's free.

29:46.853 --> 29:49.755
They say I'm gonna be
a-a big star.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.690
Make millions,
do endorsements.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.826
And they get a piece
of it all.

29:54.861 --> 29:57.329
Felt wrong to me.

29:57.429 --> 30:00.332
But my dad, he-he wouldn't
even talk about it.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.371
So, I called Ben.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.340
He understood 'cause
he's been through it, too.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.877
He said he would fix it.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.246
And they killed him.

30:20.752 --> 30:24.590
My <i>tama</i> might be scared,

30:24.690 --> 30:26.425
but not me.

30:29.061 --> 30:32.398
You need me to talk,
I'll talk.

30:33.399 --> 30:35.701
I will do whatever it takes
to stop the Koas.

30:35.801 --> 30:37.803
You've done enough.

30:37.904 --> 30:40.739
Let me take it
from here.

30:40.839 --> 30:41.974
<i>Thanks for coming, AJ.</i>

30:42.074 --> 30:44.410
Didn't really feel
like a choice.

30:44.510 --> 30:45.878
You said you
wanted to help.

30:45.978 --> 30:48.948
I said I wanted
to think about it.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.550
Ioanes don't have time
for any more thinking.

30:51.650 --> 30:54.987
Look, I-I feel for their family,
but I got a family, too.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.855
That's how the Koas
stay in power.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.790
They make sure
everyone's afraid.

30:58.891 --> 31:00.192
I already told my boy.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.793
I don't know nothing
about the Koas' business.

31:01.894 --> 31:03.429
You're not here
about their business.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.297
It's about athletes.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.233
Titus in particular.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.168
Little Tua?

31:09.936 --> 31:11.337
They own a piece of him.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.239
He wanted out.

31:13.339 --> 31:14.673
Ben tried to help.

31:14.773 --> 31:15.908
And if they're doing it
to Titus,

31:16.008 --> 31:18.010
they're doing it
to other kids, too.

31:19.178 --> 31:20.812
Plenty of boosters
on the island.

31:20.913 --> 31:23.315
You know this is different.
And if I help?

31:23.415 --> 31:24.616
What happens to me?

31:24.716 --> 31:26.518
We protect you.

31:26.618 --> 31:29.021
Easy to say inside this base,

31:29.121 --> 31:30.889
but I live out there.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.125
AJ, how did we
get by as kids?

31:35.061 --> 31:36.662
We looked out
for each other, right?

31:36.762 --> 31:38.897
If one of us was in trouble,
then it was everyone's problem.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.934
Until one of us left.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.204
Right now,

31:45.304 --> 31:49.241
you're Titus's best chance
to save his family.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.181
Might be too late.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.549
They shut down the worksite
today. Sent everyone home early.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.185
Why did they do that?

31:59.285 --> 32:03.122
'Cause they're ready to
send a final message to Maleko.

32:16.335 --> 32:17.403
Maleko.

32:17.503 --> 32:21.040
We keep having
problems with you.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.175
I promise you,
I never say nothing.

32:23.275 --> 32:26.745
I didn't say nothing.
No, no, no, not you. Your boy.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.516
Talked to the Feds.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.418
You're gonna
get him back.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.353
I can't.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.355
That's not a request.

32:40.026 --> 32:42.528
Gonna want to put the guns down.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.063
It's not your problem,
Special Agent Tennant.

32:44.163 --> 32:47.366
Just leave.
Happy to.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.335
Maleko comes with me.

32:49.435 --> 32:50.869
We can't do that.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.271
It's not a request.

32:52.371 --> 32:54.840
How you gonna make us
do that alone?

32:54.940 --> 32:56.608
I'm not alone.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.277
This is a terrible plan.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.646
Can't just let them
take Maleko inside.

33:00.746 --> 33:01.980
Or shoot our boss.

33:02.081 --> 33:03.582
There's nowhere to go.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.217
It's over.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.441
Let's go.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.016
Put your gun down!

33:38.117 --> 33:39.685
Hands in the air!

33:41.053 --> 33:42.121
You okay?

33:42.221 --> 33:44.090
Yeah. Koas?

33:44.190 --> 33:46.792
They went inside the site.
Get Maleko to safety.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.983
I'll flank. Okay.

34:45.317 --> 34:47.653
You guys good?
Yeah.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.956
Once a cornerback,
always a cornerback.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.097
What you got there,
Ernie?

34:59.198 --> 35:01.367
The financials for the
Koa brothers' businesses.

35:01.467 --> 35:05.237
The money's actually going
into a mystery account.

35:05.337 --> 35:07.173
Someone else
is getting rich.

35:07.273 --> 35:10.542
Don't know if you heard,
but we just took the Koas down.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.644
Tennant and Jesse
are escorting them to CRD.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.680
Okay, but I'm not sure
we can make

35:14.780 --> 35:16.282
a racketeering case
based off this.

35:16.382 --> 35:19.117
So, I guess it's good
they tried to kill you.

35:19.218 --> 35:22.988
Uh, what you mean is you're glad
we're safe and sound.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.123
Yeah, that,
but these records.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.025
Max and Inu Koa
will be spending

35:27.125 --> 35:30.696
life in prison, the Ioanes will
get some of their life back,

35:30.796 --> 35:33.832
and I got real estate
decisions to make.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.571
So, if the Koas weren't
getting the money, who was?

35:39.671 --> 35:41.173
Not sure.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.674
Someone really clever.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.877
And this name keeps
coming up on the paperwork.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.579
AJ Hale.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.549
You know him, right?

35:50.649 --> 35:52.784
Yeah, I do.

35:56.555 --> 35:57.523
Hey.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.491
I heard today went well.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.293
Maleko's okay.

36:02.461 --> 36:03.795
How'd you hear that?

36:04.763 --> 36:06.598
Everybody talks, yeah?

36:06.698 --> 36:08.033
Glad I was able to help.

36:08.133 --> 36:12.103
You were right...
couldn't just keep quiet.

36:12.204 --> 36:14.573
Yeah, sure.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.576
Let me get you a beer.

36:26.285 --> 36:29.588
Hey, so how long you been doing,
uh, financial work for the Koas?

36:29.688 --> 36:32.023
I wouldn't exactly

36:32.123 --> 36:34.893
call it financial work. Um...

36:34.993 --> 36:37.796
I've done some bookkeeping.
Took a class online.

36:37.896 --> 36:41.267
So, what happens now
with the businesses?

36:41.367 --> 36:42.701
Company's still going.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.571
Lot of people still working
'cause of it.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.874
Gonna try to
keep it running.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.911
You as the boss, huh?

36:53.011 --> 36:55.213
Don't know, brother.
I haven't

36:55.314 --> 36:57.516
really thought about it.

36:57.616 --> 36:59.951
Hey, what gives?
Ah...

37:01.253 --> 37:03.188
The Koas were
small-time criminals,

37:03.289 --> 37:05.924
and then suddenly they're
making shell corporations,

37:06.024 --> 37:08.960
extorting high school athletes.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.263
How did they
figure that out?

37:12.998 --> 37:14.633
'Cause I was just
thinking about everyone

37:14.733 --> 37:16.101
involved
at the operation,

37:16.201 --> 37:19.505
and who
came out ahead.

37:19.605 --> 37:21.373
Say what you
want to say.

37:24.610 --> 37:28.246
Only that you've always been the
smartest one in any group, AJ.

37:33.184 --> 37:35.454
You bust me up, man.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.423
Yeah, I've been away so long.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.558
Still think
I got motives.

37:39.658 --> 37:40.892
Look, I'll tell it
to you straight.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.695
<i>The Koas have been running scams</i>

37:43.795 --> 37:45.030
<i>all their lives.</i>

37:45.130 --> 37:48.334
You want to know how?
Got to ask them.

37:48.434 --> 37:49.901
I plan to.

37:50.001 --> 37:53.204
As long as the Koas are around,
they're kings.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.479
Is that all
you got to say?

38:00.579 --> 38:02.881
Other than
stick around?

38:02.981 --> 38:05.384
Gonna be a big time
tonight on the beach.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.920
Nah, I got places to be.

38:16.695 --> 38:19.365
There you are.
I don't want it
to be about finances.

38:19.465 --> 38:20.766
Sorry?

38:20.866 --> 38:22.768
Or being practical
or-or prudent or smart.

38:22.868 --> 38:24.135
Trying to catch up here.
We can't move in

38:24.235 --> 38:26.338
just because it's rational
and responsible.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.874
You want it to be irrational
and irresponsible?

38:28.974 --> 38:31.309
I want it to be
because you want me.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.345
Because you can't bear
the idea of me subletting

38:33.445 --> 38:35.881
a condo three blocks away
when I can be here.

38:35.981 --> 38:38.249
I do want you here, Lucy.
Really?

38:38.350 --> 38:39.485
So much.

38:39.585 --> 38:41.286
Then what was with all the comps

38:41.387 --> 38:43.021
and the graphs
and the color coding?

38:43.121 --> 38:44.690
I didn't want you to feel
pressured 'cause you didn't even

38:44.790 --> 38:45.957
tell me about it
in the first place.

38:46.057 --> 38:47.292
I didn't tell you
'cause I didn't want you

38:47.393 --> 38:49.160
to feel pressured.
Okay, great, so...

38:49.260 --> 38:51.597
why are we fighting?
We're not.

38:51.697 --> 38:54.666
Okay, so...

38:54.766 --> 38:56.167
you're moving in?

38:57.302 --> 39:00.038
You can't stop me.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.944
I mean, it is the financially
responsible decision.

39:06.044 --> 39:08.213
Oh, my gosh, hush now.

39:09.781 --> 39:10.949
Is that, is that all you own?

39:11.049 --> 39:12.718
I travel light.

39:15.253 --> 39:18.590
I'm just saying, he's not
the same AJ I remember.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.325
I don't know why
you're surprised.

39:20.426 --> 39:23.562
AJ always had
that side to him.

39:23.662 --> 39:26.865
Remember when he stole
that beer for Leila's party?

39:26.965 --> 39:28.934
She stole the beer.
He covered for her.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.970
No. He set it up.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.472
Told Leila to go in

39:33.572 --> 39:35.340
'cause there'd be less trouble
if she was caught.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.577
Either way, it's...
there's a big difference

39:38.677 --> 39:41.780
stealing a case of beer and
running a criminal conspiracy.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.949
Got to start somewhere.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.752
He changed, Hina.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.754
We all do.

39:52.524 --> 39:55.293
I want to thank you
for all your help on this.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.129
You solved the case. All I did
was toss a ball around.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.832
Ah, it was a little
more than that.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.935
And this... this was
a great idea, too.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.904
I can't take credit
for that either.

40:06.004 --> 40:07.172
This was all Titus.

40:07.272 --> 40:09.307
Okay, I'm not used to
all this modesty

40:09.407 --> 40:11.977
coming from you, Daniel.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.411
Thank you all for coming.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.814
I truly appreciate you
supporting my family

40:15.914 --> 40:17.115
in these hard times.

40:17.215 --> 40:19.718
Before we begin
the trophy presentation,

40:19.818 --> 40:21.386
we wanted
to do something.

40:21.487 --> 40:23.054
This Sivu Tau

40:23.154 --> 40:26.792
is in honor of my brother
Ben Ioane.

40:26.892 --> 40:28.894
Navy sailor,

40:28.994 --> 40:31.863
former starting quarterback
at Kawela,

40:31.963 --> 40:35.133
and proud Samoan.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.088
We do this together, son.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.457
For our family

40:59.558 --> 41:01.527
and for Ben.
