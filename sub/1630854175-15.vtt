00:02.105 --> 00:05.005
<i>Previously on
"The Rookie: Feds"...</i>

00:05.005 --> 00:06.523
It was your daughter
- that came through.
- That's my baby girl.

00:06.523 --> 00:08.698
- Fortune! Hey!
- How do you two
know each other?

00:08.698 --> 00:10.010
He arrested my mother
a while back.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.011
I've got to run.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.357
But if you need anything--

00:12.357 --> 00:14.014
anything at all--
find me.

00:15.463 --> 00:17.051
Asked for by name, huh?

00:17.051 --> 00:18.949
Well, you said to come back
if I needed anything.

00:18.949 --> 00:21.538
Would you like to go
on a date with me?
I would.

00:21.538 --> 00:22.781
Are you free
on Saturday night?

00:22.781 --> 00:24.438
Are you asking me
out on a date?

00:24.438 --> 00:26.785
Are you figuring out a way
to let me down easy?

00:26.785 --> 00:28.580
I'm just wondering
what took you so long.

00:28.580 --> 00:32.894
I was the one incarcerated
for a crime I didn't commit.

00:32.894 --> 00:34.517
How did you stay sane?

00:34.517 --> 00:37.037
Fighting to get home.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.039
To you,
to your mother.

00:39.039 --> 00:43.043
You know, I took that
settlement money from the LAPD

00:43.043 --> 00:45.597
and invested it
into the community.

00:45.597 --> 00:48.082
And the help that I've been able
to provide--

00:48.082 --> 00:50.084
you know, to people going
through the same struggle--

00:50.084 --> 00:53.053
You helped a lot of people,
Daddy. I know.

01:02.510 --> 01:04.650
Please.

01:04.650 --> 01:07.136
I'm sorry.

01:07.136 --> 01:09.828
I am so, so sorry
for what I did.

01:09.828 --> 01:10.932
I can make it up to you, though.

01:10.932 --> 01:12.624
No, no, no, no--

01:14.246 --> 01:20.597
â™ª Ah ah, ah ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

01:20.597 --> 01:23.669
Woman over PA:
<i>Hospital transport to the E.R.</i>

01:23.669 --> 01:25.257
<i>Hospital transport,
report to E.R.</i>

01:25.257 --> 01:26.914
They told me
you were here.

01:26.914 --> 01:28.778
Are you okay?
Totally fine.

01:28.778 --> 01:31.229
But you left your sweater
in my car last night.

01:31.229 --> 01:32.471
I figured
you might need it.

01:32.471 --> 01:34.853
That was thoughtful,
thank you.

01:34.853 --> 01:36.130
But what happened
to your head?

01:36.130 --> 01:38.305
Nothing.
But just returning a sweater

01:38.305 --> 01:40.169
doesn't give us as much time
to hang.

01:40.169 --> 01:42.481
But if I'm "hurt,"
a nurse has to check me out.

01:52.664 --> 01:55.943
Sorry. Gotta get that.

01:55.943 --> 01:59.049
Oh, no. A safe surrender baby
just got dropped off.

02:05.021 --> 02:06.609
Thank you.
See you after work?

02:08.335 --> 02:11.821
Daddy, your garage is like
a full-on time capsule.

02:11.821 --> 02:14.789
I found a box of my favorite
jeans from high school.

02:14.789 --> 02:17.171
I guess
they're antiques now.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.967
Watch your mouth.
They're more like vintage.

02:19.967 --> 02:22.521
But what's in this box?

02:22.521 --> 02:24.282
It's locked,
so I couldn't open it,

02:24.282 --> 02:26.318
and I want to see if some
of my stuff is in here.

02:26.318 --> 02:28.355
Why are you digging
through my stuff?

02:28.355 --> 02:30.046
I'm not
"digging through your stuff."

02:30.046 --> 02:32.393
I just wanted to make space
in the garage,

02:32.393 --> 02:35.051
and I thought this box
looked interesting.

02:35.051 --> 02:38.192
And by your reaction,
it's real interesting.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.884
Simone, put it back. Now.

02:40.884 --> 02:42.369
Sorry, Daddy.

02:42.369 --> 02:45.199
Well... what's in it?

02:45.199 --> 02:46.304
What--

02:46.304 --> 02:48.582
Why you actin' so--

02:48.582 --> 02:50.549
Hey, boss.

02:51.723 --> 02:53.759
I'll be right there.

02:53.759 --> 02:55.554
We gonna finish this
when I get home.

03:11.260 --> 03:15.436
So, at first, I'm thinking
it's something embarrassing.

03:15.436 --> 03:17.507
Maybe a photo or something
from his old funk band days.

03:17.507 --> 03:18.612
But I don't know.

03:18.612 --> 03:20.717
He's just being
really weird about it.

03:20.717 --> 03:22.063
Are you gonna open it?

03:22.063 --> 03:24.514
I want to, but he's
got a right to his privacy.

03:24.514 --> 03:27.137
Plus, what if it's
some cursed family heirloom?

03:27.137 --> 03:29.519
I don't want that juju
getting on me.

03:29.519 --> 03:32.142
Ah, it's about time
you probies showed up.

03:32.142 --> 03:34.283
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, I was in hot yoga.

03:34.283 --> 03:36.354
The humidity does a number
on my cell service.

03:36.354 --> 03:39.633
And I got a possible cursed
"mystery box" situation

03:39.633 --> 03:41.117
at home, so...

03:41.117 --> 03:43.223
What's the case, boss?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.742
It's a homicide
I pulled from LAPD.

03:45.742 --> 03:47.744
It's a male victim,
tortured and then killed.

03:47.744 --> 03:50.126
The victim's wallet
was taken-- no ID.

03:50.126 --> 03:52.784
So ERT used
a mobile fingerprint unit.

03:52.784 --> 03:54.406
His name's Paul Morrison.

03:54.406 --> 03:55.821
He's an investment banker,

03:55.821 --> 03:58.755
and he was killed...
six years ago.

03:58.755 --> 04:00.723
Six years ago?

04:00.723 --> 04:03.726
Looks like this guy was
breathing six hours ago.

04:03.726 --> 04:04.934
Exactly.

04:04.934 --> 04:07.316
His wife, Vanessa,

04:07.316 --> 04:10.111
was tried and convicted
for his murder back in 2016.

04:10.111 --> 04:12.286
As a former defense attorney,
a murder conviction

04:12.286 --> 04:13.494
without a body
is no easy feat.

04:13.494 --> 04:16.186
There must have been
an ironclad circumstantial

04:16.186 --> 04:17.636
and forensics case
against her.

04:17.636 --> 04:19.155
Which was dead wrong.

04:19.155 --> 04:21.157
This woman's been locked up
all this time

04:21.157 --> 04:22.814
for a crime
she didn't commit?

04:22.814 --> 04:25.161
Not quite. Vanessa was paroled
two weeks ago.

04:25.161 --> 04:26.576
Double jeopardy.

04:26.576 --> 04:28.337
- Oh, my God.
- So the husband

04:28.337 --> 04:30.200
fakes his death,
pins it on her.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.926
She gets out,
tracks him down,

04:31.926 --> 04:33.480
tortures him,
then murders him.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.136
Yeah, but she can't go
to prison again

04:35.136 --> 04:37.104
'cause she's already been
convicted for that crime.

04:37.104 --> 04:39.520
Says the former actor
who clearly watches
way too many movies.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.764
That's not how the double
jeopardy clause works.

04:41.764 --> 04:43.317
Vanessa's conviction
of murdering her husband

04:43.317 --> 04:44.974
six years ago
will get overturned.

04:44.974 --> 04:47.701
But if she killed him this
morning, that's a separate case

04:47.701 --> 04:49.944
with different circumstances,
i.e., a new crime.

04:49.944 --> 04:52.326
Yeah, if Vanessa did this,
she is going back to prison,

04:52.326 --> 04:53.845
most likely
for the rest of her life.

04:53.845 --> 04:55.778
But we don't have proof
that Vanessa was involved,

04:55.778 --> 04:57.538
so in the meantime,
while I contact

04:57.538 --> 04:59.713
her parole officer,
why don't you and Brendon go

04:59.713 --> 05:02.163
find out what this Paul has been
doing for the last six years,

05:02.163 --> 05:03.993
'cause people don't just
disappear for no reason.

05:03.993 --> 05:05.995
- Okay?
- Okay.

05:05.995 --> 05:08.377
You guys,
contact his next of kin.

05:08.377 --> 05:10.240
It's his sister, Donna.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.346
She is either in on this,
or she's about to get

05:12.346 --> 05:14.831
a death notification
for her big brother

05:14.831 --> 05:17.351
for the second time.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.559
You're wrong.

05:18.559 --> 05:20.527
My brother's been dead
for over six years.

05:20.527 --> 05:25.497
I know it's hard to believe,
but the fingerprints match.

05:25.497 --> 05:28.397
It's him.
It's your brother.

05:31.192 --> 05:33.333
But we had a funeral
for him.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.404
You've been raising his son, huh?

05:35.404 --> 05:37.751
Sammy.
Yeah.

05:37.751 --> 05:41.237
How do I tell him
about this?

05:41.237 --> 05:43.929
I mean, how could he just
abandon Sammy like that?

05:43.929 --> 05:46.553
How could he let Vanessa
go to prison?

05:46.553 --> 05:49.521
Oh, my God.

05:49.521 --> 05:51.834
Vanessa.
She was right.

05:51.834 --> 05:53.111
She was right about what?

05:53.111 --> 05:54.354
She came by my house
last week--

05:54.354 --> 05:56.425
Hold on, one of the stipulations
of her parole

05:56.425 --> 05:58.530
is she's not to contact you
nor Sammy.

05:58.530 --> 06:00.774
Yes, but Vanessa begged me
to see him.

06:00.774 --> 06:03.397
And then she started asking him
if he'd seen his father.

06:03.397 --> 06:06.676
She sounded
like a crazy person.

06:06.676 --> 06:08.437
Do you think
she did this?

06:08.437 --> 06:11.267
"When you're treated
a certain kind of way,

06:11.267 --> 06:13.718
you become a certain kind
of person."

06:13.718 --> 06:17.687
Six years behind bars gives you
a lot of time to plot revenge.

06:17.687 --> 06:20.725
If it was me,
I would want my son back.

06:20.725 --> 06:24.245
Especially if I was told
I could never see him again.

06:24.245 --> 06:26.109
Where is Sammy right now?

06:26.109 --> 06:27.594
He's at soccer practice.

06:27.594 --> 06:29.975
Go, go, find Sammy
and make sure that he's safe.

06:32.495 --> 06:35.325
This is the longest
you've ever been quiet.

06:38.743 --> 06:41.539
Sammy lost his mom and dad
when he was six.

06:41.539 --> 06:43.264
He's 12 now.

06:43.264 --> 06:46.233
He spent
his most formative years

06:46.233 --> 06:49.581
thinking that his mother killed
his father.

06:49.581 --> 06:52.653
It just-- My heart aches
for him, Carter.

06:52.653 --> 06:55.000
You were young, too,
when your pops went to prison.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.899
Yeah.
How'd you manage?

06:56.899 --> 06:59.626
It took us years of work
to get to where we are now.

06:59.626 --> 07:04.009
But at least when my dad was
incarcerated, I had my mama.

07:04.009 --> 07:05.804
She held
the family together.

07:05.804 --> 07:08.013
Sammy didn't have
any of that.

07:08.013 --> 07:11.120
Now he has to relive his
father's death all over again.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.674
My God.

07:13.674 --> 07:17.126
That's too much
for a young child to bear.

07:19.542 --> 07:21.751
Violent physical contact
of an extended duration

07:21.751 --> 07:24.685
could result in multiple fibers
that are also damaged in a--

07:24.685 --> 07:26.929
Hey. Pro tip--
you'll want to make sure

07:26.929 --> 07:28.482
the camera's recording.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.104
Dammit.

07:30.104 --> 07:32.935
Sorry.
What-- What are you doing?

07:32.935 --> 07:35.144
I was asked to make
an instructional video

07:35.144 --> 07:36.801
for new agent trainees
at Quantico

07:36.801 --> 07:38.596
about
carpet fiber analysis.

07:38.596 --> 07:41.391
They want it like, yesterday,
and somehow expect me

07:41.391 --> 07:44.464
to shoot and edit it on top
of my actual workload.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.983
Then it's-- it's-- it's great
that you weren't recording.

07:46.983 --> 07:48.329
'Cause you want to always
light these things

07:48.329 --> 07:50.228
from the-- the side.

07:50.228 --> 07:53.058
You know, front lighting--
terrible.

07:53.058 --> 07:55.716
You really want to start the day
by telling me I look terrible?

07:55.716 --> 07:57.304
<i>You</i> look amazing. Always.

07:57.304 --> 07:58.926
The lighting's terrible.

08:00.583 --> 08:01.653
Can I help?

08:01.653 --> 08:03.621
What,
and be my director?

08:03.621 --> 08:05.623
Don't seem so shocked, okay?

08:05.623 --> 08:08.557
I directed two episodes
of "Vampire Cop,"
I'll have you know.

08:08.557 --> 08:12.284
My choice of chiaroscuro
was mentioned in <i>Fangoria.</i>

08:13.458 --> 08:16.668
Uh, we just picked up
an odd case, but I--

08:16.668 --> 08:19.568
I can come back tonight and
very easily shoot this for you.

08:19.568 --> 08:20.914
I appreciate the offer, Brendon,

08:20.914 --> 08:22.674
but it's not that serious.

08:22.674 --> 08:23.917
It's a simple video.

08:23.917 --> 08:25.021
Do you trust me?

08:27.092 --> 08:29.232
Let me take care
of everything.

08:29.232 --> 08:30.648
All right.

08:30.648 --> 08:32.270
So, what's this odd case
of yours?

08:32.270 --> 08:36.067
Uh, it's a homicide.
Victim's name is Paul Morrison.

08:36.067 --> 08:38.207
M.E.'s sending over his clothes
for you to look at.

08:38.207 --> 08:40.209
Maybe just have a peek?

08:40.209 --> 08:42.176
Maybe there's some errant
carpet fibers or something.

08:42.176 --> 08:44.454
Don't mock my work. Sorry.

08:44.454 --> 08:46.077
- Go away.
- I'll see you tonight.

09:00.643 --> 09:03.577
I don't see him.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.475
There.

09:05.475 --> 09:06.994
With Vanessa.

09:09.445 --> 09:11.378
Be ready, but don't draw.
There are kids.

09:11.378 --> 09:13.932
Vanessa, FBI.

09:13.932 --> 09:15.278
- We need to talk.
- You alright, Sammy?

09:15.278 --> 09:16.694
He's fine.
He's with his mother.

09:16.694 --> 09:19.869
You have every right
to protect your baby.

09:19.869 --> 09:23.493
Don't make this something
he can't unsee.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.086
I love you, Sammy.

09:31.881 --> 09:34.090
Sammy,
my name is Miss Simone.

09:34.090 --> 09:35.954
We gonna go call
your Auntie Donna, okay?

09:35.954 --> 09:38.957
- Turn around.
- Oh, give me a break.
I just want to see my son.

09:38.957 --> 09:40.580
This isn't about
your parole terms.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.582
You're under arrest for
the murder of Paul Morrison.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.481
We found his body
this morning.

09:46.655 --> 09:49.623
Feels light, boss.

10:00.669 --> 10:02.532
This bastard lied.

10:02.532 --> 10:04.293
What are you guys
doing?

10:04.293 --> 10:06.951
Getting screwed over by
a dead man for the second time.

10:06.951 --> 10:09.091
I know.
It's confusing.

10:09.091 --> 10:10.437
Okay.
I'm calling security.

10:10.437 --> 10:12.128
Don't worry about it.

10:12.128 --> 10:14.855
Just so you know,
this ain't personal.

10:15.925 --> 10:17.306
Oh!

10:26.142 --> 10:27.696
Let's roll.

10:33.218 --> 10:35.496
This is crap,
and you both know it.

10:35.496 --> 10:36.566
Tell us your whereabouts from
4:00 to 8:00 this morning.

10:36.566 --> 10:37.947
It doesn't matter.

10:37.947 --> 10:40.501
You're just gonna pin
Paul's murder on me. Again.

10:40.501 --> 10:42.814
That was a gross miscarriage
of justice.

10:42.814 --> 10:45.679
But I can promise you, we simply
want to get to the bottom of it.

10:45.679 --> 10:46.887
We want to find out
what happened

10:46.887 --> 10:49.165
six years ago and today.

10:51.547 --> 10:53.549
Please.

11:01.108 --> 11:03.214
Imagine being convicted
of something

11:03.214 --> 11:05.388
you had no part
in doing.

11:05.388 --> 11:07.977
At first,
it just feels surreal.

11:07.977 --> 11:10.739
"Give it time.
These are professional lawyers

11:10.739 --> 11:12.741
and police detectives.

11:12.741 --> 11:14.984
They'll find the truth."

11:14.984 --> 11:16.537
Then it dawns on you.

11:16.537 --> 11:18.850
They want
to close the case.

11:18.850 --> 11:20.403
They want to move on.

11:20.403 --> 11:22.336
Did you always believe
Paul faked his death?

11:22.336 --> 11:23.752
Not at first.

11:23.752 --> 11:26.271
But in hindsight,
there were signs.

11:26.271 --> 11:27.514
Like what?

11:27.514 --> 11:28.722
Paul was
an investment banker,

11:28.722 --> 11:30.206
so, you know,
he made good money.

11:30.206 --> 11:33.934
But at some point he started
making extravagant purchases--

11:33.934 --> 11:37.179
sports car, lake house,
fancy watches.

11:37.179 --> 11:38.525
Did you notice
any other changes?

11:38.525 --> 11:40.113
He was stressed.

11:40.113 --> 11:42.736
Started taking calls all hours, weekends...

11:42.736 --> 11:44.393
Did he give you
any explanation?

11:44.393 --> 11:46.395
He said he had
a high-profile client.

11:46.395 --> 11:48.949
But who calls with
legitimate banking questions

11:48.949 --> 11:50.399
at 2:00 in the morning?

11:50.399 --> 11:51.780
2:00 in the morning?
Okay. So, what?

11:51.780 --> 11:54.368
So, you're thinking he took on
somebody shady?

11:54.368 --> 11:57.475
And got in too deep, so he faked
his death to disappear.

11:57.475 --> 12:00.029
Which is bad enough,

12:00.029 --> 12:03.308
but why did he have to make it
look like I killed him?

12:03.308 --> 12:05.759
He left his blood
in the kitchen,

12:05.759 --> 12:07.243
in the trunk of my car.

12:07.243 --> 12:08.969
Which gives you
a powerful motive.

12:08.969 --> 12:12.041
Damn right it does.

12:12.041 --> 12:16.252
That bastard abandoned our son,
left me to rot in prison,

12:16.252 --> 12:18.772
all to save
his sorry ass.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.326
I'm not sad he's dead.

12:21.326 --> 12:24.053
Paul got
what he deserved.

12:24.053 --> 12:26.504
But I...didn't...
kill him.

12:26.504 --> 12:28.057
Okay. So, then where were you
this morning?

12:28.057 --> 12:30.094
In my halfway house.

12:30.094 --> 12:33.925
From curfew at 9:00 last night
to 8:30 this morning.

12:33.925 --> 12:36.825
Listen.

12:36.825 --> 12:41.105
When I was your age,
my father was in prison.

12:41.105 --> 12:46.524
So I know how confusing
this time can be for you.

12:46.524 --> 12:49.838
And when I was sad,
you know what I did?

12:49.838 --> 12:51.667
I'd just tried to remember

12:51.667 --> 12:54.497
all of the fun stuff
we did together.

12:54.497 --> 12:58.985
And I would always remember how
he loved me best and most.

12:58.985 --> 13:03.817
You gotta focus
on the good memories.

13:03.817 --> 13:07.510
Hey. It'll make you feel
a lot better.

13:09.858 --> 13:11.307
Vanessa's alibi
checks out.

13:11.307 --> 13:13.102
Thank God.

13:13.102 --> 13:15.380
I did not want Sammy to have
to carry that burden.

13:15.380 --> 13:17.210
I'm gonna call holding
and get her released.

13:17.210 --> 13:19.522
Hold on. She violated
the terms of her parole

13:19.522 --> 13:21.145
by visiting her son. Twice.

13:21.145 --> 13:23.837
Terms that are now invalid.
She's innocent.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.046
I know,
but there's a process.

13:26.046 --> 13:29.739
The same process that got my
father locked up for eight years

13:29.739 --> 13:31.465
for a crime he didn't commit either.

13:31.465 --> 13:34.192
Simone, I can assure you
that I will fast-track
Vanessa's release.

13:34.192 --> 13:35.745
But right now the question
still remains--

13:35.745 --> 13:37.333
if she didn't kill Paul,
then who did?

13:37.333 --> 13:38.887
The shady client
Vanessa told us about.

13:38.887 --> 13:40.371
Ah, we might actually have
a lead on that.

13:40.371 --> 13:42.166
We met with some of Paul's
former colleagues

13:42.166 --> 13:43.477
over at
Arcadia National Bank.

13:43.477 --> 13:44.858
And most of the clients
he took care of

13:44.858 --> 13:46.515
were typical
corporate accounts.

13:46.515 --> 13:48.724
But he had one big money client
he took care of personally.

13:48.724 --> 13:51.140
At one point, the account had
over $7 million in it.

13:51.140 --> 13:53.004
And the week that Paul was
believed to have been killed,

13:53.004 --> 13:54.730
the money was withdrawn,
account closed.

13:54.730 --> 13:55.765
Who owned the account?

13:55.765 --> 13:57.043
Unclear.
It was a dummy corporation

13:57.043 --> 13:58.907
that doesn't exist anymore.

13:58.907 --> 14:00.874
They're gonna try to trace it,
but I wouldn't hold your breath.

14:00.874 --> 14:05.016
So, Paul was laundering money,
jacked it for himself.

14:05.016 --> 14:06.673
That's got to be
what got him killed, right?

14:06.673 --> 14:08.261
Antoinette just texted.

14:08.261 --> 14:09.676
She got something off
his personal effects.

14:09.676 --> 14:11.885
I'll be right back. Yep.

14:11.885 --> 14:14.405
Hey--
what'd you find?

14:14.405 --> 14:17.097
M.E. found this curled up in
the victim's front pants pocket.

14:17.097 --> 14:18.892
- Ah. What is it?
- Good question.

14:18.892 --> 14:22.240
It was too compromised by the
victim's blood to make it out.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.586
If only there was a way
to just--

14:23.586 --> 14:25.002
May I finish, Brendon?

14:25.002 --> 14:26.624
Yeah. Sorry.

14:26.624 --> 14:30.559
So I exposed it to aluminium
sulfate and steady dry heat--

14:30.559 --> 14:32.561
et voilÃ .

14:34.218 --> 14:36.910
Oh, my God.
It's a parking slip.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.705
Advantage Auto Park,
Santa Monica.

14:38.705 --> 14:42.467
Time-stamped for-- oh--
an hour before he was murdered.

14:42.467 --> 14:44.228
God, I wonder if there's
a security camera

14:44.228 --> 14:45.125
in that location,
just like--

14:45.125 --> 14:46.471
I figured you'd ask that.

14:46.471 --> 14:48.818
So I reached out to the lot, and...

14:48.818 --> 14:51.200
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, that's Paul.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.030
What is that?

14:53.030 --> 14:54.479
Passport photos?

15:00.796 --> 15:04.282
No plates on the van, but IT
is running facial recognition.

15:04.282 --> 15:06.457
Oh, my God. You have gone
above and beyond.

15:06.457 --> 15:08.114
You're just incredible.

15:10.116 --> 15:12.428
Brendon, we're at the office.
People can see us.

15:12.428 --> 15:15.845
No one's looking.
This time.

15:15.845 --> 15:18.641
If you want to kiss,
be smart about it.

15:22.507 --> 15:24.509
Mm.

15:28.306 --> 15:30.964
See?

15:30.964 --> 15:32.345
Now back to work. Okay.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.315
His name's Wally Sanborn.

15:37.315 --> 15:40.180
He's a funeral director
at a local mortuary.

15:40.180 --> 15:42.631
That's why Paul brought him
passport photos--

15:42.631 --> 15:44.115
he's in
the fake ID business.

15:44.115 --> 15:45.703
I mean,
creating new identities

15:45.703 --> 15:47.532
is a perfect side hustle
for a mortician.

15:47.532 --> 15:49.293
They have access
to the recently deceased,

15:49.293 --> 15:51.778
Social Security numbers,
personal information--

15:51.778 --> 15:54.091
everything you need
to steal an identity.

15:54.091 --> 15:55.609
Paul faked his death already.

15:55.609 --> 15:58.095
Why would he need a new identity
six years later?

16:01.374 --> 16:04.342
Oh, God.

16:04.342 --> 16:07.794
These places give me the creeps.

16:07.794 --> 16:10.107
What are you
so afraid of?

16:10.107 --> 16:11.971
Z-Zombies.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.558
Wally Sanborn?

16:13.558 --> 16:15.146
You're telling me these places
don't creep you out

16:15.146 --> 16:16.630
just a little bit?

16:16.630 --> 16:18.322
Well, death is a natural part
of life.

16:18.322 --> 16:20.117
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

16:21.739 --> 16:24.811
Ohh, boy.

16:24.811 --> 16:26.399
Oh, boy. You jumped.

16:28.677 --> 16:31.024
Hello?

16:31.024 --> 16:35.028
FBI!
Stop what you're doing.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.926
Why?
I'm not doing anything wrong.

16:36.926 --> 16:41.034
You're literally burning
evidence right now, sir.

16:42.725 --> 16:44.382
Ahh, are you kidding?

16:44.382 --> 16:46.039
Hey! Come on!

16:46.039 --> 16:47.558
â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

16:49.284 --> 16:51.113
â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

16:52.873 --> 16:54.703
â™ª Yeah, yeah, ha, ha

16:54.703 --> 16:56.912
<i>â™ª Miedo del infierno
me quita el cuerno â™ª</i>

16:56.912 --> 16:58.603
Oh, crap!
Ooh!

16:58.603 --> 16:59.708
<i>â™ª Miedo del infierno me quita
el cuerno â™ª</i>

16:59.708 --> 17:02.055
Ah! Ugh!
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

17:02.055 --> 17:07.095
<i>â™ª Miro la cara y veoâ™ª</i>

17:11.961 --> 17:13.791
Oh. Hi.

17:13.791 --> 17:16.173
Uh, by chance, did you see a man
in a dark suit run through here?

17:16.173 --> 17:17.691
Great. Okay.

17:17.691 --> 17:20.073
Thank you.
Sorry for your loss.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.110
<i>â™ª La hora de mi prueba â™ª</i>

17:22.110 --> 17:23.904
<i>â™ª AquÃ­ ha llegado mi tiempo â™ª</i>

17:23.904 --> 17:25.458
<i>â™ª AquÃ­ ha llegado
mi tiempoâ™ª</i>

17:25.458 --> 17:27.287
<i>â™ª AquÃ­ ha llegado mi tiempoâ™ª</i>

17:27.287 --> 17:29.531
<i>â™ª La hora de mi pruebaâ™ª</i>

17:31.084 --> 17:33.293
I definitely
swallowed that ash.

17:33.293 --> 17:34.950
Wally Sanborn
is on the run.

17:34.950 --> 17:36.710
Last seen
fleeing the mortuary.

17:49.930 --> 17:52.657
It's primarily pulverized
bone fragments.

17:52.657 --> 17:54.211
So completely harmless.

17:54.211 --> 17:56.799
Never mind.
Subject in custody.

18:01.010 --> 18:03.634
We have video of you speaking
with Paul Morrison this morning.

18:03.634 --> 18:06.257
Uh-huh.
So, can you help us
identify his abductors?

18:06.257 --> 18:07.465
You kidding me?

18:07.465 --> 18:09.571
All I saw was the barrel
of that gun.

18:09.571 --> 18:10.986
You see,
this is what I get

18:10.986 --> 18:12.470
for breaking the number one rule
in my business.

18:12.470 --> 18:13.471
What's that rule?

18:13.471 --> 18:15.266
No repeat customers.

18:15.266 --> 18:17.924
I told Paul that,
but he was insistent.

18:17.924 --> 18:20.133
He said he'd pay triple
the going rate.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.860
Did he say why he wanted
a new identity this time?

18:22.860 --> 18:26.243
Hey, number one rule in my
business-- never ask questions.

18:26.243 --> 18:28.245
Okay, well, is there anything
you can tell us

18:28.245 --> 18:30.247
about your interaction?

18:30.247 --> 18:33.491
You know, maybe he was scared
someone was after him?

18:33.491 --> 18:36.874
All I know is, six years ago,
he was a nervous wreck.

18:36.874 --> 18:39.118
Desperate
to disappear fast.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.326
But the Paul
that I met yesterday

18:40.326 --> 18:42.845
was like
a totally different dude.

18:42.845 --> 18:44.882
Slick. Confident.

18:44.882 --> 18:46.504
Said he needed to get
a new identity

18:46.504 --> 18:47.850
and pick up something
in town.

18:47.850 --> 18:48.989
Did he say what?

18:48.989 --> 18:51.268
No,
and I didn't ask.

18:51.268 --> 18:52.855
Number one rule in my business, remember?

18:52.855 --> 18:54.133
I think
that was number two.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.686
- What was that?
- It doesn't matter.

18:55.686 --> 18:59.517
We are gonna need the identity
you gave Paul six years ago.

18:59.517 --> 19:02.520
Yeah? Number one rule
in my business--

19:02.520 --> 19:03.659
Oh, my God.

19:03.659 --> 19:05.385
Never work for free.

19:05.385 --> 19:07.353
I'm gonna need a lawyer
and a deal first.

19:07.353 --> 19:08.526
Okay.
Okay.

19:14.532 --> 19:17.190
Well... you heard that.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.192
Some answers,
more questions.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.332
And no closer to figuring out
who killed Paul.

19:21.332 --> 19:23.231
Well, we just got another
piece of the puzzle.

19:23.231 --> 19:25.578
There was a shooting at
Gentle Woods Cemetery today.

19:25.578 --> 19:27.062
A GSW to the chest.

19:27.062 --> 19:28.650
He was rushed
into emergency surgery.

19:28.650 --> 19:31.239
They pulled the bullet out,
and the striations

19:31.239 --> 19:32.550
match the ones
that killed Paul.

19:32.550 --> 19:33.655
Okay.
Hmm.

19:33.655 --> 19:35.070
So it was probably
the same shooter.

19:35.070 --> 19:36.830
But what's our unsub doing
at a cemetery?

19:36.830 --> 19:39.419
He was digging up
Paul Morrison's gravesite.

19:39.419 --> 19:41.870
Paul told Wally that he had
to go pick up something.

19:41.870 --> 19:43.354
Now,
someone like Paul--

19:43.354 --> 19:45.253
cold, calculating--
he might've stashed the money

19:45.253 --> 19:47.047
in case he ever had to go
on the run somewhere.

19:47.047 --> 19:50.016
It's a bold move-- bury it
at your own fake gravesite.

19:50.016 --> 19:51.845
One place no one
would ever look.

19:51.845 --> 19:54.538
Until your killer tortures you,
gets the location out of you.

19:54.538 --> 19:57.265
Well, the only lead we have is
Paul's alternate identity.

19:57.265 --> 19:59.715
So we need to track down
what he's been up to
for the last six years.

19:59.715 --> 20:01.372
Okay.
I'll get an A-USA in here

20:01.372 --> 20:03.443
to start working on a deal
for Wally.

20:03.443 --> 20:04.306
- Thanks, boss.
- Yeah.

20:06.101 --> 20:07.413
That's it?
I'm free?

20:07.413 --> 20:09.242
To leave here, yes,
but there's still some hoops

20:09.242 --> 20:10.968
for you to jump through before
you'll be exonerated.

20:10.968 --> 20:12.866
Why?
You proved I didn't do it.

20:12.866 --> 20:14.420
But now it has to be brought
to a judge.

20:14.420 --> 20:16.076
First thing you need
is an attorney.

20:16.076 --> 20:17.457
They'll present your case
in court.

20:17.457 --> 20:19.701
Also, they can work on restoring
custody of your son.

20:19.701 --> 20:22.462
And exploring possible
constitutional violations

20:22.462 --> 20:24.292
of your civil rights--Carter...

20:24.292 --> 20:25.396
can you give us a sec?

20:25.396 --> 20:26.501
Yeah, sure.

20:28.813 --> 20:30.367
Overwhelming, huh?

20:30.367 --> 20:32.783
I have no family
or friends anymore.

20:32.783 --> 20:35.095
They all deserted me
long ago.

20:35.095 --> 20:37.650
I don't know
what to do.

20:37.650 --> 20:40.239
I think I might be able
to help with that.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.551
Rather,
I know someone who can.

20:44.415 --> 20:46.279
Come on. After you.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.593
Hey, y'all.

20:49.593 --> 20:51.422
- Hey, Simone.
- Hey. Nice to see you.

20:51.422 --> 20:53.286
- I like your hair.
- Thank you.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.081
Hey, Daddy.
Hey, baby girl.

20:55.081 --> 20:56.565
This is Vanessa.

20:56.565 --> 20:57.980
Hey. I'm Cutty.

21:00.189 --> 21:02.640
C-Come, sit down.
Sit. Sit.

21:05.298 --> 21:07.404
You don't trust me,
do you?

21:07.404 --> 21:10.096
You probably don't trust anyone
right now.

21:10.096 --> 21:11.753
I get it.

21:11.753 --> 21:13.306
The system
does that to you.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.860
Yeah,
it fills you with anger.

21:15.860 --> 21:18.346
Sometimes,
when you're locked up,

21:18.346 --> 21:21.107
that's the only thing
that you can control.

21:21.107 --> 21:23.454
It becomes your friend,
your best friend.

21:23.454 --> 21:26.112
Hey, it becomes
your only friend.

21:26.112 --> 21:29.667
But cutting loose
that anger

21:29.667 --> 21:33.637
that is where
you have to start.

21:33.637 --> 21:36.709
Because everything
that you do now

21:36.709 --> 21:41.990
will be tainted with that pain
until you just let it go.

21:41.990 --> 21:45.131
Look, all I care about
is my son.

21:45.131 --> 21:48.030
I want things to be
the way they were before.

21:48.030 --> 21:49.618
I want our normal back.

21:49.618 --> 21:52.897
Honey, normal is gone. Forever.

21:52.897 --> 21:54.623
So don't even go
looking for it.

21:54.623 --> 21:56.349
It's a process.

21:56.349 --> 22:00.146
Like, when I first got out,
I was guarded, too.

22:00.146 --> 22:03.218
He still keeps
a few secrets--

22:03.218 --> 22:06.083
sometimes locked away
in little wooden boxes.

22:06.083 --> 22:08.465
Mm-hmm.
Look, trust me.

22:08.465 --> 22:12.365
It's possible to still have
a great relationship

22:12.365 --> 22:13.918
with your son again.

22:16.369 --> 22:17.819
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

22:17.819 --> 22:20.028
Where do I start?

22:20.028 --> 22:21.201
Simone and Cutty: Pie!

22:21.201 --> 22:23.480
You--Always pie.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.205
Always.

22:25.205 --> 22:26.517
Pecan?

22:26.517 --> 22:29.693
Look, y'all talk.
I'll get it.

22:31.142 --> 22:33.697
Synthetic fiber analysis
is an important part

22:33.697 --> 22:35.043
of any FBI Field Office
laboratory--

22:35.043 --> 22:36.562
Okay, cut.

22:36.562 --> 22:39.047
Can we get a little touch-up
on her forehead?

22:39.047 --> 22:40.911
- Why? What's wrong?
- No, nothing.

22:40.911 --> 22:43.189
And-- And the turn
at the beginning,

22:43.189 --> 22:45.433
it just feels a
little... unmotivated.

22:45.433 --> 22:48.021
Uh, look.

22:48.021 --> 22:51.197
Antoinette, you're not
a laboratory technician.

22:51.197 --> 22:53.441
Yes, I am.
No, not in my film,
you're not.

22:53.441 --> 22:55.235
You're an avatar
for the victims.

22:55.235 --> 22:57.514
You speak for the dead.

22:57.514 --> 23:00.724
You're the tip of the spear,
solving unsolvable crimes.

23:00.724 --> 23:02.070
I-It's--
That's who you are.

23:02.070 --> 23:06.868
But that's not what this video
is about, Brendon.

23:06.868 --> 23:08.628
And I'm becoming
quite frustrated.

23:08.628 --> 23:09.802
Good, use that.

23:09.802 --> 23:11.976
Just like that.
Okay, let's go.

23:11.976 --> 23:13.426
Rolling.
And... action.

23:15.739 --> 23:18.293
And that's why proper F.A.C.I.D.
searches for polymer class

23:18.293 --> 23:19.812
can save both time
and effort.

23:19.812 --> 23:21.123
Uh, cut.

23:21.123 --> 23:22.642
What was wrong
with that?!

23:22.642 --> 23:24.161
I don't know. It's just
not what I'm envisioning. It--

23:24.161 --> 23:25.749
What <i>you</i>
were envisioning?!

23:25.749 --> 23:28.234
This was supposed to be
a simple video for the Academy.

23:28.234 --> 23:29.787
I-I know.
I'm just trying to help.

23:29.787 --> 23:31.617
By not listening to me.
No, thanks.

23:38.589 --> 23:41.627
Uh... that's a--
that's a wrap.

23:41.627 --> 23:43.594
The fact that you're taking
my son across the country

23:43.594 --> 23:46.148
is unbelievable.

23:46.148 --> 23:47.943
I can't talk about this
right now. I gotta go.

23:48.875 --> 23:50.187
Hey.
Hey.

23:50.187 --> 23:51.913
My shift ends soon.
You hungry?

23:51.913 --> 23:54.294
I was thinking sushi or...

23:54.294 --> 23:55.848
Are you okay?

23:55.848 --> 23:58.437
Fine. Yeah.
Just, uh, some drama stuff.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.197
Yeah, let's eat.

24:00.197 --> 24:01.647
I want to hear about
what's happening

24:01.647 --> 24:03.752
with that safe surrender baby
from this morning.

24:03.752 --> 24:07.480
Oh.
Poor thing was so sick.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.172
For a few hours,
it looked dire.

24:10.172 --> 24:12.589
I held her so long,
my arms started to cramp.

24:12.589 --> 24:15.143
But she's a fighter.

24:16.627 --> 24:20.113
Well, now it's my turn to ask.
Are you okay?

24:20.113 --> 24:21.805
I never wanted to be
a mom.

24:21.805 --> 24:24.048
I have the most ridiculous
relationship with my own,

24:24.048 --> 24:25.325
as you know.

24:25.325 --> 24:28.501
But this girl woke something
in me.

24:31.297 --> 24:33.679
Sorry, we've only been
on a few dates,

24:33.679 --> 24:35.163
and here I go mentioning
the "B" word.

24:35.163 --> 24:36.682
Not sexy.

24:36.682 --> 24:38.684
Also not hinting
at anything.

24:38.684 --> 24:40.651
Relax. I-I got a son.
I get it.

24:40.651 --> 24:42.722
Okay.

24:42.722 --> 24:45.691
I'm going to clock out
and change.

24:45.691 --> 24:46.864
Start thinking
of where we can eat.

24:46.864 --> 24:48.245
Surprise me.

24:50.212 --> 24:53.181
Hey, Fortune,
this is my work texting me.

24:53.181 --> 24:54.665
I'm so sorry.

24:54.665 --> 24:55.908
I gotta get back.

24:55.908 --> 24:57.910
Oh. Okay.

25:00.050 --> 25:01.534
And this isn't about
what I just said?

25:01.534 --> 25:04.157
No. Come on.
No, no, no, this...

25:04.157 --> 25:05.434
Raincheck?
Sure.

25:05.434 --> 25:07.575
Good luck.

25:07.575 --> 25:09.024
With work.

25:21.899 --> 25:23.452
Oh.
No tie today?

25:23.452 --> 25:26.076
Someone's
a bureaucratic rebel.

25:26.076 --> 25:28.078
I must've forgot
to put one on.

25:30.218 --> 25:34.463
Of course he has backups.

25:34.463 --> 25:37.052
Hey, B,
how's the filming going?

25:37.052 --> 25:39.468
Oh, so good.

25:39.468 --> 25:41.850
There's some weird vibes
coming off the menfolk in here

25:41.850 --> 25:43.093
this morning.
Mm-hmm.

25:43.093 --> 25:44.439
Good, you're all here.

25:44.439 --> 25:47.269
The A-USA finalized the deal
with Wally Sanborn,

25:47.269 --> 25:49.306
and he gave up the fake identity
he created

25:49.306 --> 25:51.619
for Paul Morrison
six years ago.

25:51.619 --> 25:54.242
Nicholas Jones-- got an address
in Salt Lake City.

25:54.242 --> 25:56.865
Insurance salesman.
Married, no kids.

25:56.865 --> 25:59.419
Laura, Brendon, the jet-- it's
getting fueled up as we speak.

25:59.419 --> 26:01.283
Go there.
Talk to the wife, friends,

26:01.283 --> 26:03.320
anyone who he may have done
business with.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.217
I'll have a search warrant
for his house

26:04.217 --> 26:05.218
by the time you guys land.

26:05.218 --> 26:06.599
Yeah. On it.

26:06.599 --> 26:10.154
The groundskeeper who was shot
at Paul's gravesite--

26:10.154 --> 26:11.639
he pulled through.

26:11.639 --> 26:14.469
So, our best guess is whoever
shot him also killed Paul,

26:14.469 --> 26:16.644
so I need you guys to go
to the hospital,

26:16.644 --> 26:18.956
be there by the time this guy
wakes up, talk to him.

26:18.956 --> 26:21.545
Let's go, "Backup Tie."

26:23.271 --> 26:25.169
And then she just, like...

26:25.169 --> 26:26.654
...stormed out.

26:26.654 --> 26:28.725
So to be clear,
Antoinette asked for your help?

26:28.725 --> 26:30.589
Well, uh, not really.
Oh, no.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.728
I mean,
I offered, but--

26:31.728 --> 26:33.522
Mm.
You inserted yourself.

26:33.522 --> 26:34.938
She said she wanted something
simple, but I just--

26:34.938 --> 26:36.353
So you just had to go
above and beyond

26:36.353 --> 26:37.975
because you wanted
to impress her.

26:37.975 --> 26:39.321
And you let your ego
get in the way

26:39.321 --> 26:41.634
instead of
actually relating to her

26:41.634 --> 26:43.325
and listening
to what she needed.

26:43.325 --> 26:44.672
Yeah.

26:46.363 --> 26:48.089
Oh, man.
I screwed up, didn't I?

26:48.089 --> 26:49.953
Yep. You know it.

26:49.953 --> 26:51.851
But now you just got to do
whatever you can

26:51.851 --> 26:53.128
to make it right.

26:53.128 --> 26:54.751
How?

26:54.751 --> 26:57.374
You know, Brendon,
I am your training agent,

26:57.374 --> 26:58.686
not your life coach.

26:58.686 --> 27:00.377
Just figure it out.

27:00.377 --> 27:03.104
Because you are in danger of
blowing up your relationship

27:03.104 --> 27:05.865
before it even has a chance
to really begin.

27:05.865 --> 27:07.211
You know, you would make
an excellent life coach.

27:07.211 --> 27:09.179
Okay,
could you stop talking?

27:09.179 --> 27:11.215
And keep digging through
the victim's fake identity.

27:14.840 --> 27:17.325
Are you looking for your girl,
or avoiding her?

27:17.325 --> 27:18.809
Why would I be
avoiding her?

27:18.809 --> 27:21.191
You're a terrible liar.

27:21.191 --> 27:23.158
Whatever it is,
I know it's your fault,

27:23.158 --> 27:25.126
so be honest
and apologize.

27:25.126 --> 27:26.783
Woman over PA: <i>Dr. Garro,
please report to cardiology.</i>

27:26.783 --> 27:28.474
Hello.

27:28.474 --> 27:30.579
Mr. Irwin, Special Agents Hope
and Clark, FBI.

27:30.579 --> 27:32.685
We need to ask you some
questions about your assault.

27:32.685 --> 27:35.481
But first,
how are you feeling, dear?

27:35.481 --> 27:37.690
Am I in hell?

27:37.690 --> 27:41.211
No. Close.
Los Angeles.

27:41.211 --> 27:44.593
But the good thing
is you survived.

27:44.593 --> 27:46.803
Can you tell us
what you remember?

27:46.803 --> 27:49.840
I saw the white light.

27:49.840 --> 27:50.910
Are you angels?

27:50.910 --> 27:52.705
Uh, no.

27:52.705 --> 27:54.603
But we can be,

27:54.603 --> 27:57.710
if you tell us what you know
about who shot you.

27:57.710 --> 28:00.437
What-- What did you remember
before the white light?

28:00.437 --> 28:02.335
I, um...

28:02.335 --> 28:03.820
I saw a white van.

28:03.820 --> 28:06.374
Okay, good. The people
we're after drove a white van.

28:06.374 --> 28:07.927
Do you remember
anything about it?

28:07.927 --> 28:10.723
The license plate
said P-C-I.

28:10.723 --> 28:13.899
I-I remember that 'cause
that's my father's initials.

28:13.899 --> 28:15.866
I-I thought it was f-funny
to begin with.

28:15.866 --> 28:18.697
Then it
wasn't funny anymore.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.596
Um, three guys digging up a--
a grave.

28:21.596 --> 28:23.460
One had a gun.

28:23.460 --> 28:25.600
Pow.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.878
White light.

28:27.878 --> 28:29.604
So I'm really not in hell?

28:29.604 --> 28:32.193
No, sweetie. But if you gotta
keep questioning,

28:32.193 --> 28:33.608
you might want to get back
to church.

28:40.753 --> 28:41.858
FBI!

28:43.480 --> 28:45.862
Suzie Jones? FBI.
I'm Special Agent Stensen.

28:45.862 --> 28:47.242
What's going on?

28:47.242 --> 28:50.245
We have a warrant to search
the property.

28:50.245 --> 28:54.042
And he framed his first wife
for his murder?

28:54.042 --> 28:55.043
Yeah.

28:55.043 --> 28:56.769
This can't be real.

28:56.769 --> 29:00.428
We, uh, take it you didn't know
much about your husband's past?

29:00.428 --> 29:01.740
I guess not.

29:03.776 --> 29:07.159
We met four years ago,
when I was a flight attendant,

29:07.159 --> 29:09.126
on my L.A.
to Salt Lake route.

29:09.126 --> 29:11.991
He said he was an insurance
salesman, an only child,

29:11.991 --> 29:13.441
and that his parents
had passed.

29:13.441 --> 29:15.788
He didn't give me any reason
to question that.

29:17.617 --> 29:19.136
Do you think he was trying to do
the same thing to me

29:19.136 --> 29:20.759
he did
to his other wife?

29:20.759 --> 29:22.243
- We don't know.
- Okay, well, we need to learn

29:22.243 --> 29:23.692
everything about the life
he created here.

29:25.108 --> 29:26.109
I can't believe
this is happening.

29:26.109 --> 29:27.317
Hey, boss.

29:27.317 --> 29:28.974
<i>I just ran the partial plate.</i>

29:28.974 --> 29:32.529
There are four late-model
white Dodge vans with P-C-I

29:32.529 --> 29:35.463
in the number in California,
and there's one locally.

29:35.463 --> 29:39.260
It belongs to a drug dealer
named Leon MacTavish.

29:39.260 --> 29:41.158
<i>I just sent you the address
of a warehouse</i>

29:41.158 --> 29:42.539
<i>where the car is registered.</i>

29:42.539 --> 29:44.127
Got it.

29:44.127 --> 29:45.162
I'm sending a SWAT team
to meet you there, too.

29:45.162 --> 29:46.785
So, proceed with caution.

30:00.005 --> 30:01.144
Right here.

30:02.559 --> 30:03.836
Go, go, go.

30:06.287 --> 30:08.289
FBI,
show us your hands!

30:08.289 --> 30:10.015
FBI! Go, go, go!

30:38.284 --> 30:40.148
Suspects fleeing south
on Alhambra Avenue--

30:40.148 --> 30:42.081
requesting backup
and an airship.

30:42.081 --> 30:43.048
You coming?!

30:46.706 --> 30:49.571
â™ª And who gonna say what?

30:49.571 --> 30:50.987
Simone, Simone,
there's no way

30:50.987 --> 30:52.505
you can catch them
in this thing.

30:52.505 --> 30:54.473
Sure about that?
Hold on.

30:56.130 --> 30:57.717
â™ª And who gonna say
what, what? â™ª

30:59.892 --> 31:01.790
â™ª And who gonna say
what, what? â™ª

31:03.551 --> 31:05.898
Hold on.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.693
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

31:07.693 --> 31:09.212
Hold on.
Hold on, Carter!

31:09.212 --> 31:11.041
Ohhh!

31:12.491 --> 31:13.733
Simone!

31:13.733 --> 31:15.011
Ahhh.

31:15.011 --> 31:16.736
I got it!
I got it!

31:16.736 --> 31:18.255
â™ª Till the job is done

31:18.255 --> 31:19.947
â™ª Please don't try this girl
'cause <i>ay vaâ™ª</i>

31:19.947 --> 31:21.534
â™ª CrÃ¨me de la crme,
la flow the trampa â™ª

31:21.534 --> 31:23.260
I gotcha!

31:23.260 --> 31:24.710
â™ª And who gonna say what?

31:27.368 --> 31:28.472
Hold on.

31:29.749 --> 31:31.303
Unh!

31:31.303 --> 31:32.304
â™ª And who gonna say
what, what? â™ª

31:34.375 --> 31:36.308
â™ª And who gonna say
what, what? â™ª

31:38.448 --> 31:40.484
â™ª And who gonna say
what, what? â™ª

31:42.452 --> 31:44.074
â™ª And who gonna say
what, what? â™ª

31:47.008 --> 31:48.596
Simone,
what are you doing?

31:48.596 --> 31:49.666
I'm gonna cut him off.

31:49.666 --> 31:50.943
â™ª What?

31:50.943 --> 31:54.119
â™ª Who gonna say what?

31:54.119 --> 31:55.775
Get ready.

31:55.775 --> 31:58.778
Three, two, one!

32:02.921 --> 32:04.336
FBI!Show us your hands!

32:04.336 --> 32:05.647
Hands!

32:05.647 --> 32:07.166
Show us your hands!

32:15.174 --> 32:17.107
Leon, Leon.

32:17.107 --> 32:19.316
Look, this is just a huge misunderstanding,

32:19.316 --> 32:21.111
'cause I ain't done
nothing wrong.

32:21.111 --> 32:24.804
Leon, innocent people rarely
shoot at the Feds and run.

32:24.804 --> 32:26.151
This is America, friend.

32:26.151 --> 32:28.187
I got the right
to defend myself.

32:28.187 --> 32:29.948
I mean, how am I supposed
to know y'all FBI?

32:29.948 --> 32:32.329
The big letters F-B-I
on the front

32:32.329 --> 32:34.987
of our tactical vests
could've been a hint.

32:34.987 --> 32:36.333
Lady, I can buy those
at the swap meet.

32:36.333 --> 32:37.817
Okay, let's cease
with the charade.

32:37.817 --> 32:40.441
We know Paul was laundering
your money six years ago

32:40.441 --> 32:41.994
through Arcadia National.

32:41.994 --> 32:43.375
We also know it was your gun
that took his life

32:43.375 --> 32:45.273
after you tortured him
to get the location

32:45.273 --> 32:46.826
of where that money
was stashed.

32:46.826 --> 32:48.967
And then you used
that same gun

32:48.967 --> 32:50.451
to shoot the groundskeeper

32:50.451 --> 32:53.695
after you dug up the money
underneath Paul's fake grave.

32:53.695 --> 32:55.628
Well, if you all know
so much, whatchu need me for?

32:55.628 --> 32:57.285
To answer one question.

32:57.285 --> 32:59.046
How did you know Paul was alive
and in L.A.?

32:59.046 --> 33:01.048
We saw your phone records, boo.

33:01.048 --> 33:03.050
We know the day
before Paul arrived,

33:03.050 --> 33:06.122
you got a phone call
from a Salt Lake City number.

33:06.122 --> 33:09.056
So, who was it
that tipped you off, Leon?

33:12.714 --> 33:14.371
I don't know.

33:16.270 --> 33:18.375
But you can ask my lawyer.

33:23.035 --> 33:24.933
Hey, Matt, we're on the tarmac
about to take off. What's up?

33:24.933 --> 33:26.832
We have Paul's killer
in custody.

33:26.832 --> 33:29.214
He's a drug dealer that he
screwed over six years ago

33:29.214 --> 33:31.354
by the name
of Leon MacTavish.

33:31.354 --> 33:32.872
So we just tore up
Suzie Jones' house for nothing?

33:32.872 --> 33:34.495
<i>No, not exactly.</i>

33:34.495 --> 33:36.531
Leon knew that Paul was alive
and in town

33:36.531 --> 33:39.051
because he received an anonymous
phone call from a burner cell

33:39.051 --> 33:40.259
that pinged off
of a tower in--

33:40.259 --> 33:42.020
Let me guess--
Salt Lake City?

33:42.020 --> 33:42.882
<i>Bingo.</i>

33:42.882 --> 33:44.160
Stop the plane!

33:46.576 --> 33:48.371
- Back already?
- Uh-huh.

33:48.371 --> 33:52.237
You find out who killed Nicky--
I mean, "Paul"?

33:52.237 --> 33:54.446
Yes. His killers
are in custody.

33:54.446 --> 33:57.414
You know, turns out one of them
was tipped off

33:57.414 --> 33:59.796
by a phone call
- from Salt Lake City.
- Mm-hmm.

33:59.796 --> 34:01.694
I don't understand.

34:01.694 --> 34:03.938
I think you understand
a lot more than you let on.

34:03.938 --> 34:05.905
You didn't meet Paul
in Salt Lake City, did you?

34:05.905 --> 34:07.804
You met him in Los Angeles
when you were hubbed there--

34:07.804 --> 34:08.908
what was it?-- seven--
seven years ago?

34:08.908 --> 34:10.358
Seven? No.

34:10.358 --> 34:12.360
We met four years ago.
I told you that.

34:12.360 --> 34:14.362
No, we have the flight logs
from the FAA.

34:14.362 --> 34:16.778
Which tells us you knew
all about his wife and kid

34:16.778 --> 34:18.125
when you started
your affair.

34:18.125 --> 34:19.540
- That's not true.
- Sure it is.

34:19.540 --> 34:21.093
And I bet he told you
all about Leon,

34:21.093 --> 34:23.440
his $7 million client,

34:23.440 --> 34:26.271
and I bet it was your idea
to steal the money.

34:26.271 --> 34:27.927
Fake his death.
Blame it on the wife.

34:27.927 --> 34:30.275
That way, he could start a whole
new life here in Salt Lake.

34:30.275 --> 34:31.931
This is absurd.

34:31.931 --> 34:34.555
Now, tell me,
was it your idea

34:34.555 --> 34:36.419
to bury the money
at the gravesite?

34:36.419 --> 34:38.006
Hmm?

34:38.006 --> 34:41.389
Yes. It was.

34:41.389 --> 34:43.564
And that's why there was nothing
there-- because you dug it up

34:43.564 --> 34:45.566
the minute he gave you a reason
to doubt him.

34:45.566 --> 34:47.809
'Cause once a cheater,
always a cheater, right?

34:47.809 --> 34:50.778
Which is smart 'cause he did
move on with a new identity

34:50.778 --> 34:52.573
without,
you know, you.

34:52.573 --> 34:54.954
You were right
- not to trust him.
- Mm-hmm.

34:54.954 --> 34:56.301
He was just gonna steal
the money,

34:56.301 --> 34:58.268
trade you in
for a new wife.

34:58.268 --> 35:00.339
Oh, but you weren't gonna be
the woman scorned.

35:00.339 --> 35:01.927
No, too clever for that.

35:01.927 --> 35:04.171
So you tipped off Leon,

35:04.171 --> 35:06.138
let him and his boys
do your dirty work for you.

35:06.138 --> 35:09.866
Wow. Fun story.

35:09.866 --> 35:12.662
But it's a lot easier to tell
than it is to prove.

35:17.563 --> 35:20.048
The A-USA
isn't moving forward

35:20.048 --> 35:21.291
with pressing charges
against Suzie.

35:21.291 --> 35:22.361
What?
Why not?

35:22.361 --> 35:23.811
Not enough evidence
to make a case.

35:23.811 --> 35:25.882
Well, so she's just gonna
get away with it?

35:25.882 --> 35:28.160
Hey, Simone,
remember, this is the FBI.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.610
We play
the long game here.

35:29.610 --> 35:31.059
We have no problem
taking our time

35:31.059 --> 35:32.268
when we have a target
in sight.

35:32.268 --> 35:34.166
And Suzie,
she just became a celebrity

35:34.166 --> 35:36.203
at the Salt Lake City
Field Office.

35:36.203 --> 35:38.032
So they'll be watching her
like a hawk,

35:38.032 --> 35:41.035
especially after we freeze
all of her assets.

35:41.035 --> 35:42.899
Sooner or later,
she's gonna need money.

35:42.899 --> 35:45.660
Right. So, she if tries to spend
a dime of that stolen cash...

35:45.660 --> 35:47.662
We snatch her ass up.

35:47.662 --> 35:48.870
I can live with that.

35:52.011 --> 35:55.463
Okay, Ivy got her law degree
from Yale.

35:55.463 --> 35:57.914
But don't worry,
she's-- she's good people.

35:57.914 --> 36:00.572
Just a little bit uppity, hmm?

36:00.572 --> 36:02.367
Okay. Be nice, Cutty.

36:02.367 --> 36:04.507
I'll get your exoneration
finalized quickly.

36:04.507 --> 36:06.716
Pro bono, of course.

36:06.716 --> 36:08.269
- Really?
- It's for a good cause.

36:14.033 --> 36:17.105
Daddy, was that one of
your soldiers for justice?

36:17.105 --> 36:18.728
You know it.

36:18.728 --> 36:21.317
After she gets
my exoneration finalized,

36:21.317 --> 36:23.111
Cutty's gonna help me
get custody of Sammy.

36:23.111 --> 36:26.045
Okay, and-- and what does
Aunt Donna have to say about it?

36:26.045 --> 36:28.358
She actually offered
to help me

36:28.358 --> 36:30.326
transition back
into Sammy's life.

36:30.326 --> 36:32.224
I'm going to one
of his soccer games today.

36:32.224 --> 36:33.777
Gotta start
mothering again.

36:33.777 --> 36:36.194
Alright.
Bit of advice--

36:36.194 --> 36:38.265
bring orange slices
for Sammy's team.

36:38.265 --> 36:40.232
Those always play well.

36:40.232 --> 36:43.270
I can handle that.

36:43.270 --> 36:45.755
This means everything
to me.

36:45.755 --> 36:46.963
Thank you both so much.

36:46.963 --> 36:48.240
Come here.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.348
Aww. Daddy.

36:52.348 --> 36:53.694
Hmm?

36:53.694 --> 36:55.454
You're changing her life.

36:55.454 --> 36:57.870
She deserves
a fighting chance.

36:57.870 --> 36:59.941
Just like the one I got.

36:59.941 --> 37:01.564
Mm.

37:03.566 --> 37:04.670
Hey.

37:08.571 --> 37:11.539
And I didn't... listen
to you.

37:14.611 --> 37:16.958
Promise never
to do it again?

37:16.958 --> 37:19.306
Promise.

37:19.306 --> 37:20.307
Okay.

37:20.307 --> 37:22.550
That was your one pass.

37:22.550 --> 37:23.620
Really?

37:23.620 --> 37:26.071
Yes.

37:26.071 --> 37:28.315
Because I know
why you did it.

37:28.315 --> 37:29.833
You're
an artistic person.

37:29.833 --> 37:33.423
You've spent your entire life creating.

37:33.423 --> 37:35.632
And you don't have
that outlet anymore.

37:35.632 --> 37:37.807
But we can fix that.

37:37.807 --> 37:40.465
I signed us up for
an introductory painting class.

37:40.465 --> 37:42.294
Painting?

37:42.294 --> 37:44.020
Perhaps we can find
an outlet together.

37:44.020 --> 37:46.022
Yeah.

37:46.022 --> 37:47.403
Totally.
I love that.

37:48.749 --> 37:51.130
But can I get the supplies?
They're so expensive.

37:51.130 --> 37:53.788
Oh, I already have
oil paints.

37:53.788 --> 37:55.169
A gift
from my ex-boyfriend.

37:55.169 --> 37:56.515
Ex-boyfriend?

37:56.515 --> 37:58.206
Mm.

37:58.206 --> 37:59.863
He didn't listen to me either.

38:03.867 --> 38:07.526
What, no fake injury?
I'm kind of disappointed.

38:07.526 --> 38:09.666
My co-worker and I had
a bet going.

38:09.666 --> 38:12.151
I said tennis elbow,
he had you as a neck sprain.

38:12.151 --> 38:13.843
I almost went
with food poisoning,

38:13.843 --> 38:15.638
but that was
a big commitment.

38:15.638 --> 38:17.295
Also might be a tougher segue
from that

38:17.295 --> 38:19.849
to asking
if you're free for dinner.

38:19.849 --> 38:22.541
Thought I scared you off.
With the baby talk.

38:22.541 --> 38:24.336
No. Hey.

38:26.338 --> 38:30.653
I'm sorry. It wasn't you
or what you said.

38:30.653 --> 38:32.655
I had just gotten a phone call
from my ex-wife.

38:32.655 --> 38:35.899
She's been talking about moving
to New Orleans with my son,

38:35.899 --> 38:37.556
but she's pulled
the trigger.

38:37.556 --> 38:41.180
And the phone call was a
heads-up that she's serving me

38:41.180 --> 38:43.251
the papers asking
for full custody of our son.

38:43.251 --> 38:45.668
So,
I was a little shook.

38:45.668 --> 38:47.739
And when you mentioned a baby,
I just--

38:47.739 --> 38:49.085
Oh, Carter.

38:49.085 --> 38:50.638
You could've just
said that.

38:50.638 --> 38:54.193
I'm not the greatest
at communicating sometimes.

38:54.193 --> 38:56.713
Reason number 23
why I'm getting a divorce.

38:56.713 --> 38:58.197
But look at you now.

38:58.197 --> 39:00.061
Making adjustments
and being real about it.

39:01.062 --> 39:02.547
I don't know you well,

39:02.547 --> 39:03.927
but that sounds like growth
to me.

39:03.927 --> 39:06.033
Thanks.

39:06.033 --> 39:08.725
And I'm sorry I bailed on you
last night.

39:08.725 --> 39:10.865
Can I make it up to you?

39:10.865 --> 39:12.384
Sure.

39:12.384 --> 39:16.388
But I don't get off
for another two hours.

39:16.388 --> 39:19.426
You're worth waiting for.

39:19.426 --> 39:22.946
Bam. I'll take 20, domino.
That's game, baby.

39:22.946 --> 39:25.846
Why can't I ever beat you?

39:25.846 --> 39:28.504
Because I am the best.

39:28.504 --> 39:31.023
I guess.

39:31.023 --> 39:33.060
Wait, um...

39:33.060 --> 39:35.545
â™ª I'll keep holding on

39:36.960 --> 39:39.135
What's this?

39:42.034 --> 39:45.555
Oh.
Your mystery box.

39:45.555 --> 39:47.385
Go ahead. Open it.

39:51.043 --> 39:54.909
This is mama's stuff.

39:54.909 --> 39:59.431
This is the scarf she used to
wear all the time.

40:00.639 --> 40:03.711
â™ª It won't be long

40:03.711 --> 40:06.231
It doesn't have her scent anymore.

40:06.231 --> 40:09.614
â™ª There's a light
at the end of the tunnel â™ª

40:09.614 --> 40:13.963
Letters she wrote me
when I was in prison.

40:13.963 --> 40:16.137
They were my lifeline.

40:16.137 --> 40:18.243
Daddy... why did you keep
this hidden?

40:18.243 --> 40:19.900
This stuff is beautiful.

40:19.900 --> 40:21.108
I still feel guilty

40:21.108 --> 40:24.352
about missing all those years
with you two.

40:24.352 --> 40:26.113
Oh, Daddy...

40:26.113 --> 40:30.462
We had less than two years with
your mother after I got home.

40:30.462 --> 40:34.846
I guess I locked
all those memories

40:34.846 --> 40:38.643
and my grief
in that box.

40:38.643 --> 40:41.473
Can I read one?

40:41.473 --> 40:44.165
â™ª But will I see the end?

40:44.165 --> 40:45.443
Mm-hmm.

40:49.032 --> 40:52.933
"Hey, babe. I just wanted
to let you know

40:52.933 --> 40:55.142
that your two favorite girls
are thinking of you.

40:55.142 --> 41:00.216
We-- We miss you more
every day.

41:00.216 --> 41:04.876
And there's already been
730 of them.

41:04.876 --> 41:07.810
Yes, I'm counting.

41:07.810 --> 41:09.846
Because each day I mark off
the calendar

41:09.846 --> 41:12.677
is one day closer
to you being home."

41:12.677 --> 41:15.507
Daddy.

41:15.507 --> 41:18.855
"Simone wiped some of the
frosting from her birthday cake

41:18.855 --> 41:21.237
at the bottom of the page
so you would feel like

41:21.237 --> 41:23.239
you were a part
of the celebration.

41:23.239 --> 41:26.242
I can't believe
our baby's 10.

41:26.242 --> 41:28.382
The party isn't the same
without you,

41:28.382 --> 41:30.695
but your spirit
is here with us."

41:33.042 --> 41:35.354
"Keep your chin up

41:35.354 --> 41:37.840
so your crown
doesn't fall.

41:37.840 --> 41:39.911
You're still our king."

41:39.911 --> 41:42.534
Hmm.

41:42.534 --> 41:44.432
â™ª I'll keep holding on

41:44.432 --> 41:48.057
"P.S. I could've really used you
as backup today.

41:48.057 --> 41:51.647
Did you know she thinks she can
cuss now that she's 10?"

41:53.407 --> 41:55.858
"I'll let you guess
which word she chose.

41:55.858 --> 41:57.653
Love, Your Sweet Thing."

41:57.653 --> 42:00.103
Aww!

42:00.103 --> 42:03.210
I did think I was grown
that day.

42:03.210 --> 42:06.247
You thought that the moment
you came out of the womb.

42:08.353 --> 42:11.839
Hey.
What word did you say?

42:11.839 --> 42:13.220
She never told me.

42:13.220 --> 42:14.393
Unh-unh!

42:14.393 --> 42:17.673
That word is being locked
in this box,

42:17.673 --> 42:19.537
and I'm gonna throw away
the key.

42:19.537 --> 42:20.676
Don't even think about it.

42:22.091 --> 42:24.265
Oh, no.

42:24.265 --> 42:25.508
â™ª I'll keep holding on

43:03.650 --> 43:05.617
