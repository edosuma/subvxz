01:56.500 --> 01:58.860
SIREN BLARES
Over here!

02:06.060 --> 02:07.900
Well, we all mess up,
we're all fallible,

02:08.100 --> 02:10.495
we've all done things
of which we are ashamed.

02:10.884 --> 02:13.018
The trick in life, I think...

02:13.340 --> 02:14.460
is knowing which things

02:14.566 --> 02:17.229
we should forgive ourselves for,
and which not.

02:17.557 --> 02:20.100
Except I'm not sure
it really is that.

02:20.300 --> 02:23.540
Suspect is a white male,
mid-40s, wearing a navy top

02:23.700 --> 02:25.020
and a grey baseball cap.

02:25.220 --> 02:26.740
Last seen walking toward
Burleigh Road,

02:26.940 --> 02:29.100
witnesses said he had
a knife in his hand. Over.

02:29.140 --> 02:30.820
I think a part of me wonders

02:31.020 --> 02:34.180
if I'm just coming to a
natural conclusion here.

02:34.340 --> 02:37.175
I've been doing this for... 28 years?

02:39.540 --> 02:41.180
There are other things
to do in life.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.817
Not like this.

02:45.139 --> 02:47.259
So why did you retire?

02:47.284 --> 02:49.955
I didn't retire. I was A19-ed.

02:50.144 --> 02:52.144
In the cutbacks.
Ah.

02:52.282 --> 02:55.202
The truth is, what I did,
what you still do,

02:55.682 --> 02:58.955
when you lose it, you realise
what a privilege it was.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.430
To be able to help people,

03:00.485 --> 03:02.645
often at the very worst moment
of their lives,

03:02.687 --> 03:04.967
to find faith in the world again.

03:05.900 --> 03:08.745
Cos I genuinely believe that's
a big part of what we do.

03:09.003 --> 03:11.568
Restore a little shape,
a little order,

03:11.593 --> 03:13.273
a little meaning to the world.

03:13.714 --> 03:16.794
I mean, not so much on traffic duty,
but, erm...

03:22.980 --> 03:26.307
And obviously Naked Gun.
Yeah, oh, say, Naked Gun.

03:26.356 --> 03:27.356
Midnight Run?

03:27.392 --> 03:29.760
Oh, man, Midnight Run.
Yep. Definitely.

03:29.858 --> 03:31.417
And Fargo would be on there.

03:31.441 --> 03:33.321
"You're darn tootin'!"
"OK, hun!"

03:33.396 --> 03:34.636
BOTH CHUCKLE

03:35.116 --> 03:38.057
His BP and stats are very low now.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.572
Get me four units of red cells...

03:41.260 --> 03:44.340
Well, that was a great evening,
thank you.

03:45.438 --> 03:47.838
I'd really like to do it again
sometime.

03:48.639 --> 03:50.239
Yeah, me too.

03:50.871 --> 03:52.791
All right, this is me.

03:56.980 --> 03:59.860
HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

04:00.020 --> 04:01.300
Well, anyway...

04:02.340 --> 04:03.820
..good night, then.

04:08.380 --> 04:09.380
Good night.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.100
MOBILE RINGS

04:16.300 --> 04:18.700
Yes, it went very well,
and no, I didn't snog him.

04:18.899 --> 04:20.899
Sorry, boss, that's not
what I was ringing about.

04:21.899 --> 04:23.380
What? Pete Carr.

04:23.580 --> 04:26.260
He's been attacked
outside his office. Stabbed.

04:26.420 --> 04:27.580
Oh, no!

04:29.300 --> 04:31.220
They say he's gonna be OK, but...

04:32.460 --> 04:34.060
No, no!

04:47.300 --> 04:49.780
He still had the knife on him
when they nicked him.

04:49.940 --> 04:51.100
Who was he?

04:51.260 --> 04:52.780
Some local nutjob.

04:52.940 --> 04:54.380
Links to far-right groups,

04:54.580 --> 04:56.820
got geed up by all the
online paedophile stuff.

04:57.020 --> 05:00.140
So we go after all those... fuckers.
Absolutely.

05:11.620 --> 05:15.580
She's exaggerating. Tim and I
were out for about 45 minutes,

05:15.740 --> 05:17.020
and Pete just went down the pub.

05:17.060 --> 05:18.140
And Chris Lowe?

05:18.340 --> 05:20.396
I don't know where Chris went,
you'd have to ask him.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.180
But you accept you were
all out of the house

05:23.380 --> 05:25.820
at various points between
9pm and midnight?

05:26.020 --> 05:27.900
Yes.
So why did you lie?

05:28.100 --> 05:30.580
I would have thought that had
become blindingly obvious.

05:30.780 --> 05:32.380
I thought there was
a very good chance

05:32.580 --> 05:34.140
anything I told you
would be leaked,

05:34.340 --> 05:36.540
and given my best friend is
now in intensive care,

05:36.700 --> 05:37.900
entirely because of you,

05:38.100 --> 05:39.980
I think I had pretty
good reason to be nervous.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.500
Can we move on to your car,
Mr Hollis?

05:46.700 --> 05:49.700
Which, in fact,
matches exactly the description

05:49.900 --> 05:52.860
of a car seen driving erratically
at approximately 12:20am

05:53.060 --> 05:54.900
on the morning that Hayley
went missing.

05:55.100 --> 05:57.260
And how many dark saloons
with trailer bars

05:57.300 --> 05:58.980
would there be in the Hardy area?

05:59.180 --> 06:00.700
We didn't ask your opinion,
Miss Gray.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.260
Although she's right.

06:02.460 --> 06:05.260
But I suspect even my ex-wife
will confirm I was in the house

06:05.420 --> 06:06.900
in bed at 12:20am.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.780
How old was your son...

06:15.780 --> 06:17.740
..that New Year's Eve, James?

06:18.820 --> 06:20.460
How old was Eliot?

06:22.540 --> 06:23.820
15.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.700
Actually, only a few weeks off 16,
I believe.

06:27.900 --> 06:31.700
And sadly, quite a
troubled young man, it seems.

06:31.860 --> 06:34.140
Already arrested twice,

06:34.300 --> 06:35.700
for possession of cannabis,

06:35.860 --> 06:37.740
once for ecstasy,

06:37.940 --> 06:41.220
and just one month before
New Year's Eve 1999,

06:41.420 --> 06:44.220
for stealing his dad's car and
driving it whilst drunk.

06:44.420 --> 06:46.580
Which is why I have to ask you,
James...

06:48.140 --> 06:50.380
..did Eliot take your car
that night?

06:50.540 --> 06:51.900
No.

06:52.060 --> 06:54.180
Maybe he came across Hayley,

06:54.380 --> 06:57.220
maybe hitch-hiking somewhere,
picked her up?

06:57.420 --> 07:00.700
Something happened between them,
something went wrong...

07:00.860 --> 07:02.380
Eliot's never hurt a fly.

07:02.540 --> 07:03.900
Maybe it was an accident.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.260
The car was seen to be driving
erratically.

07:06.300 --> 07:09.540
Maybe he was drunk, maybe he knocked
her down, it was a dark, wet night.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.540
But in either instance,

07:11.700 --> 07:12.820
you found out.

07:13.020 --> 07:15.180
And agreed to drive the body
back up to London

07:15.220 --> 07:17.500
to obscure your son's involvement.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.660
The idea that I would
drive the dead body

07:19.860 --> 07:22.020
of a young girl my son had
killed, to London,

07:22.060 --> 07:23.700
is...

07:23.860 --> 07:27.620
as absurd as it is abhorrent.

07:27.820 --> 07:30.300
Then can we ask you why,
when we first interviewed you,

07:30.500 --> 07:32.860
you referred to your son
as a "little boy"?

07:34.380 --> 07:36.620
A turn of phrase.
Really?

07:36.780 --> 07:38.020
We think it was deliberate.

07:38.220 --> 07:41.100
We think that you didn't want us
to even consider the idea

07:41.300 --> 07:43.860
that there was effectively another
adult in the house that night.

07:43.940 --> 07:44.940
I don't want my client

07:45.140 --> 07:47.500
answering any more questions
about his son.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.700
So unless you have any
actual evidence,

07:49.900 --> 07:52.540
rather than shot-in-the-dark
theories, I think we're done here.

07:54.700 --> 07:55.700
OK.

08:01.260 --> 08:02.540
Henry.

08:03.820 --> 08:08.460
We spoke to Maria.
Pete's conscious and talking.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.420
Stay strong, fella, stay strong.
Yeah, you too.

08:16.820 --> 08:19.540
It was stupid, and I apologise.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.100
A case of misguided loyalty.

08:22.260 --> 08:24.140
Misguided loyalty to who?

08:25.220 --> 08:26.820
Jamie.

08:27.020 --> 08:30.660
He rang us all after he'd first
been interviewed by you,

08:30.860 --> 08:34.820
and he said he told you that
we all stayed in that night.

08:36.340 --> 08:39.460
The inference I took was that
we should all say the same.

08:39.659 --> 08:41.620
Why do you think
he wanted you to lie?

08:42.820 --> 08:45.580
At first I thought it was
because of his profile

08:45.780 --> 08:48.100
that he didn't want the press
latching onto him.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.620
And, yeah, I was happy
to go along with that,

08:51.660 --> 08:54.260
because I didn't for a
nanosecond believe there was any...

08:55.980 --> 08:57.780
..darker motive.

08:59.220 --> 09:02.220
Except then yesterday Pete rang me.

09:02.380 --> 09:03.740
Pete Carr.

09:05.540 --> 09:08.180
And he told me something
about Jamie's son.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.050
Told you what?

09:10.740 --> 09:14.540
He said he'd seen Eliot
climbing into the house

09:15.097 --> 09:16.820
through a first-floor window

09:16.860 --> 09:19.540
at around two in the morning
on New Year's Day.

09:25.300 --> 09:28.237
OK, so where are we
with Eliot Hollis?

09:28.300 --> 09:29.740
Still looking for him.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.020
But for what it's worth,

09:31.220 --> 09:33.100
I just pulled this off an
online employment site

09:33.220 --> 09:34.580
which he signed up to in 2007,

09:34.780 --> 09:37.237
when he was living in the
States with his dad.

09:37.300 --> 09:40.776
It details holiday work on a
building site in the UK, so...

09:41.245 --> 09:44.620
OK. Let's check James Hollis's car,

09:44.820 --> 09:46.820
the BMW, I wanna see
its service history.

09:46.846 --> 09:49.213
Maybe speak to the ex again,
check their bank statements,

09:49.238 --> 09:50.318
insurance companies.

09:50.365 --> 09:52.765
I want to know if the car
had any bodywork repairs done

09:52.797 --> 09:55.117
in the months immediately
after Hayley died.

09:59.735 --> 10:01.960
I just wanna say I'm sorry, Pete.

10:03.340 --> 10:06.140
I was angry, and... shocked...

10:07.620 --> 10:10.340
..but I also know in my heart
you're a good man.

10:11.740 --> 10:15.124
Yeah, you've done some silly things,
we both know that, but...

10:17.540 --> 10:18.700
..you're a good man.

10:19.780 --> 10:22.140
And I want you to hear
that I know that.

10:24.100 --> 10:28.420
Basically, I think Hayley
used a sort of code,

10:28.580 --> 10:30.020
in her diary,

10:30.220 --> 10:31.860
I'm guessing
for if her mum read it,

10:32.060 --> 10:34.020
so she wouldn't know what
she was referring to.

10:34.180 --> 10:36.300
So, first up,

10:36.500 --> 10:39.220
when she has sex,
I think she calls it "tea".

10:39.420 --> 10:41.700
And then, and I think this is
actually more important,

10:41.900 --> 10:44.980
when she says she had some cake, I
think she's saying she took drugs.

10:45.140 --> 10:47.140
So this is just a small selection

10:47.340 --> 10:50.260
of the times these words appear,
but you can see a clear pattern.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.900
"Great cake at Marly's, then
went shopping, a very nice trip."

10:52.980 --> 10:56.140
"Went clubbing in Portsmouth,
ate cake, up till six."

10:56.340 --> 10:59.100
"Had tea and cake with Ade,
his birthday present to me,

10:59.260 --> 11:01.020
"just what I always wanted."

11:01.220 --> 11:03.660
The reason I think
this is significant

11:03.820 --> 11:04.820
is this reference here.

11:04.980 --> 11:08.340
This is dated two days
before she disappeared.

11:08.540 --> 11:11.020
And here, she says,
"G's gonna get us some cake

11:11.180 --> 11:13.420
"for the New Year party."

11:13.620 --> 11:17.420
I think this is why
she left work earlier,

11:17.580 --> 11:18.980
I think G's is where she was going.

11:19.140 --> 11:23.140
Dealer, maybe? Or friend
who was selling her some gear.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.700
Erm...

11:24.900 --> 11:27.340
I mean, it might explain
how she could have been

11:27.500 --> 11:29.100
in the vicinity of the Spinney,

11:29.300 --> 11:31.860
which from the pub, is the
opposite direction to the party.

11:33.940 --> 11:36.060
Nice work, Fran.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.420
OK, can we liaise with
Hampshire Police

11:38.580 --> 11:39.820
on local drug dealers,

11:39.980 --> 11:41.660
then and now?

11:41.820 --> 11:43.700
But really good work, Fran.

11:45.140 --> 11:46.740
Thanks, guys.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.180
Shall we?

11:49.340 --> 11:51.260
Miller, hi, it's me.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.220
Erm... I'm sorry I haven't
rung before,

11:55.260 --> 11:58.300
but I just needed some time
on my own to think things through.

11:59.460 --> 12:01.180
And I wanted to say...

12:02.500 --> 12:07.060
..don't believe what you might
hear about me from the police.

12:07.220 --> 12:08.780
I'm not a bad man.

12:08.980 --> 12:11.260
I made some mistakes
but I'm not a bad man.

12:26.700 --> 12:29.740
So, why did you lie, Christopher?

12:31.140 --> 12:34.900
I lied, erm... because from the
moment Hayley Reid went missing

12:35.100 --> 12:36.660
I sort of believed
that at some point

12:36.860 --> 12:39.180
someone would knock on my door
wanting to blame me.

12:41.020 --> 12:43.980
Which... I believed for
a number of reasons.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.620
None of which include me having
anything to do with her death.

12:46.740 --> 12:51.380
Erm... in late December 1999...

12:52.980 --> 12:55.220
..I was in a bad way, mentally.

12:55.420 --> 12:58.980
I was in the manic phase,
I know now, of a bipolar episode.

13:00.140 --> 13:03.060
Exacerbated by over-work,
and by a personal event

13:03.220 --> 13:04.620
that had...

13:04.780 --> 13:06.700
profoundly traumatised me.

13:08.380 --> 13:09.580
And on New Year's Eve,

13:09.780 --> 13:12.660
in addition to me idiotically
taking some cocaine,

13:12.820 --> 13:14.780
it overwhelmed me.

13:14.940 --> 13:16.660
And I became very unwell.

13:16.860 --> 13:22.420
I think I ended up leaving the
house, and just, just walking,

13:22.580 --> 13:24.940
eh, I dunno where,

13:25.100 --> 13:26.900
for a couple of hours.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.780
And then finally, when I returned,
I was exhausted

13:29.980 --> 13:31.460
and I fell asleep
almost immediately,

13:31.620 --> 13:32.780
and then the next day...

13:34.140 --> 13:36.260
..news started to filter through

13:36.300 --> 13:38.620
about this missing local girl,
and...

13:40.220 --> 13:43.540
..because of this personal thing
that had happened,

13:43.740 --> 13:46.300
and I suppose to a degree because
of my poor mental health,

13:46.500 --> 13:50.740
I became... obsessed that the
police would come for me,

13:50.940 --> 13:52.900
that a knock on the door
was imminent.

13:53.060 --> 13:55.540
But it-it-it didn't actually come.

13:55.740 --> 13:58.780
Not that day, nor the next, or the
day after. It didn't come.

13:58.980 --> 14:01.140
But, erm... I never stopped
waiting for it.

14:02.860 --> 14:05.380
So, when you finally showed up,
DCI Stuart,

14:05.580 --> 14:07.860
in my head I went straight
back to those first days

14:08.020 --> 14:09.580
after Hayley Reid went missing,

14:09.780 --> 14:11.740
I felt the same fear,
the same panic,

14:11.900 --> 14:12.980
and yeah, I lied.

14:13.140 --> 14:14.900
I lied about where I was that night.

14:15.100 --> 14:18.940
That is all that I lied about,
because I swear, I-I...

14:19.100 --> 14:20.940
I didn't hurt Hayley Reid.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.300
I never even met her.

14:23.500 --> 14:27.220
And this event, that fed
into your paranoia...

14:28.740 --> 14:30.380
..what was that?

14:30.540 --> 14:32.380
Yeah, so, uh...

14:32.580 --> 14:36.780
On October 12th 1999 I was
arrested for credit card payments

14:36.820 --> 14:39.180
to online child sex abuse sites.

14:40.460 --> 14:43.540
The card was a business one, which
meant I was arrested at the office,

14:43.740 --> 14:46.420
and the police told my
business partner, Helen,

14:46.580 --> 14:48.260
because I sometimes visited

14:48.460 --> 14:50.940
commercial shoots
involving children.

14:52.980 --> 14:54.780
She then told the board,

14:54.980 --> 14:57.620
and in January 2000,
she told my wife.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.500
Two months later, when I was
charged, the board sacked me.

15:01.660 --> 15:03.500
Then my wife filed for divorce.

15:03.700 --> 15:07.260
So, within four months
of my arrest...

15:08.820 --> 15:11.140
..yeah, I lost, erm...

15:11.300 --> 15:13.460
I lost everything.

15:13.620 --> 15:15.140
Everything I loved.

15:16.820 --> 15:19.580
My wife, Laura, and my career.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.500
My...
CHOKES UP

15:26.220 --> 15:28.140
My beautiful daughter.

15:30.580 --> 15:33.660
Yeah. Yeah, my life just
pretty much collapsed.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.180
But here's the thing,

15:38.340 --> 15:39.540
it wasn't me.

15:41.060 --> 15:43.300
The credit card payments,
I didn't make them.

15:44.980 --> 15:48.380
My life had been ruined, and
I was completely, 100% innocent.

15:54.300 --> 15:57.140
And do you happen to remember
who packed the trailer?

15:57.340 --> 16:00.460
Jesus! You don't think...?
Do you?

16:02.180 --> 16:05.460
I always used to pack the bags,
and...

16:05.660 --> 16:07.940
James always used to put them
in the trailer.

16:08.140 --> 16:11.700
OK. And your car, a BMW 3 series,
I believe?

16:11.900 --> 16:14.700
Yeah. Do you recall if it sustained
any damage over that break?

16:15.820 --> 16:18.300
You think it was a car accident?
Do you?

16:29.540 --> 16:31.420
Mrs Hollis?

16:31.580 --> 16:33.940
He said he'd hit a deer.

16:34.140 --> 16:38.020
Your husband?
Yes, my husband. Who else?

16:39.820 --> 16:42.900
Why don't you take a look at these
photos, and this floor plan...

16:46.980 --> 16:49.860
..and tell me if you can remember
which bedroom

16:50.020 --> 16:52.020
you and your husband slept in,

16:52.180 --> 16:54.020
which bedroom your friends slept in,

16:54.180 --> 16:55.300
and which your son.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.380
No.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.020
My card details, like those

17:03.220 --> 17:05.900
of hundreds of other
completely innocent people

17:06.060 --> 17:07.140
were cloned.

17:07.339 --> 17:11.540
Of course, I protested my innocence,
I told them, "This is crazy.

17:11.579 --> 17:15.020
"I've never visited these sites,
it's absurd, a mistake."

17:16.380 --> 17:18.339
But I was charged.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.859
And then...

17:21.540 --> 17:25.099
..then suddenly I was living alone
in a depressing flat in Acton.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.740
And my trial date had not been set.

17:30.580 --> 17:34.460
I managed to salvage some money from
my separation, and I found a lawyer,

17:34.620 --> 17:36.060
and we hired a team of investigators

17:36.140 --> 17:38.540
to prove that the sites paid for
were never actually visited,

17:38.700 --> 17:41.180
they proved that when
the payments were made,

17:41.380 --> 17:44.100
allegedly from my work computer,
I was abroad.

17:44.260 --> 17:47.460
And so in 2003, finally,

17:47.620 --> 17:48.620
the charges were dropped

17:48.780 --> 17:50.780
and I was granted a
record deletion application

17:50.940 --> 17:52.820
in 2004.

17:52.980 --> 17:55.100
By this time Laura had remarried,

17:55.140 --> 17:56.180
and I hadn't seen her,

17:56.380 --> 17:58.940
or been allowed to see my daughter,
for three years.

17:59.140 --> 18:01.860
I was living in shelters,
or on the streets,

18:02.060 --> 18:05.340
without access to
the medication I needed.

18:06.980 --> 18:08.940
LAUGHS
The idea of just turning up,

18:09.140 --> 18:12.340
and persuading them I hadn't
somehow bought my innocence...

18:15.580 --> 18:17.340
..yeah, that was beyond me.

18:19.260 --> 18:22.100
So I had to try and begin to accept
what had happened to me,

18:22.260 --> 18:23.340
this awful injustice,

18:23.500 --> 18:26.580
this catastrophic unfairness.

18:26.740 --> 18:28.620
To try... to try and...

18:28.780 --> 18:30.060
rebuild a life.

18:31.300 --> 18:34.780
You know, which sounds simpler
than it actually was,

18:34.940 --> 18:35.940
because I was homeless,

18:36.140 --> 18:38.740
in and out of temporary
accommodation for six more years...

18:42.220 --> 18:44.740
..before Tim...
CHOKES UP

18:44.900 --> 18:47.220
..my friend, Tim,

18:47.380 --> 18:49.500
he finally tracked me down,

18:49.540 --> 18:52.700
bought me my first van, in 2010,

18:52.900 --> 18:55.860
then I began to live again,
rather than just exist.

18:56.060 --> 18:59.020
Then one week ago, you turn up, and
ask a man who has lost everything,

18:59.180 --> 19:02.100
through, what, just simple bad luck,

19:02.300 --> 19:05.940
someone... someone who knows
what can happen,

19:06.140 --> 19:07.940
and you ask him where
he was that night.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.500
Yeah, so, that's why I lied.

19:14.580 --> 19:15.780
That.

19:16.820 --> 19:18.820
(That.)

19:19.020 --> 19:22.460
James Hollis's ex remembers
his son slept in a box room.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.780
The only box room in the house

19:24.980 --> 19:27.140
has a window that goes out
onto a flat roof.

19:27.180 --> 19:28.700
Which supports Tim Finch's claim

19:28.900 --> 19:30.780
that Pete Carr saw him
seen climbing in at 2am.

19:30.940 --> 19:32.420
Exactly.

19:33.620 --> 19:36.100
Yeah.

who's been looking after Peter.

19:55.580 --> 19:58.140
Oh, right. Yes. How's he doing?

20:07.100 --> 20:08.460
(Shit.)

20:10.140 --> 20:12.500
D'you believe him?
I dunno.

20:13.540 --> 20:14.940
Maybe.

20:15.100 --> 20:16.580
You speak to the legal firm,

20:16.780 --> 20:19.540
I'll try and track down the
unit that investigated him. OK.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.540
KNOCK ON DOOR
Guv?

20:21.880 --> 20:25.120
King's Lynn nick just rang.

I just wanted to ring

21:05.010 --> 21:06.930
..desperately sad I was...

21:09.212 --> 21:11.532
..to hear about your
husband's death.

21:16.520 --> 21:19.440

have you got anything to say?

'that undoubtedly contributed

I just went out to grab a bag.
I didn't forget to turn it off.

22:35.240 --> 22:38.240
Dad -
I just want to say that I've been...

22:39.720 --> 22:42.880
..thinking about what we were
discussing the other day.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.240
And I am genuinely sorry about
what you are going through.

22:47.520 --> 22:49.480
I'm fine.
The problems at work

22:49.640 --> 22:51.000
or whatever it is personally.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.040
My personal life is fine, too.

22:53.240 --> 22:55.920
Of course... I'll always be there,
you know?

22:57.080 --> 22:58.880
To give you whatever I can,

22:59.040 --> 23:00.240
whenever you need it.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.240
Wow. Well, thank you so much.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.000
It's just that, erm...

23:05.640 --> 23:08.120
..well, at the moment I think it
would be better for both of us

23:08.200 --> 23:10.560
if I were to give you
a bit of space.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.920
So I think it's best if I
move in with Jenny for a bit.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.520
All right.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.440
Anyway...

23:16.640 --> 23:18.840
it'll be a rehearsal for us,
you know?

23:19.000 --> 23:20.800
"Rehearsal."

23:22.760 --> 23:24.920
I asked her last night
if she'd marry me.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.600
She said she would.

23:26.760 --> 23:29.280
So, we'll probably...

23:29.440 --> 23:31.040
buy somewhere together, next year.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.920
Sorry, you mean, like,
move in together? Cos you can't...

23:34.120 --> 23:35.760
you can't buy somewhere together,
can you?

23:35.920 --> 23:38.360
Cos you're the only one
with any money.

23:46.480 --> 23:49.560
I never thought that
we'd fall out about money.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.720
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.040

And I'm so sorry for that.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.880
For all the mistakes I made,
which I want to put right.

24:27.040 --> 24:28.120
Now!

24:28.280 --> 24:30.720
It's too late. We've moved on.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.000
I've moved on.

24:34.080 --> 24:35.360

24:35.520 --> 24:37.840
you... love her, do you,

24:38.000 --> 24:39.600
this... Sal?

24:39.760 --> 24:40.760
Yes, I do.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.800
And the girls, I mean...

24:45.000 --> 24:47.800
Surely we owe it to them
to ask what they'd like?

24:47.960 --> 24:49.560
"We"?

24:49.760 --> 24:53.280
Surely you can't deny them that.
I mean, if they want it,

24:53.480 --> 24:55.840
the chance for us all
to be together again.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.600
A proper family.

24:59.840 --> 25:02.320
You always said
the girls came first.

25:06.440 --> 25:09.160
But I never meant for anyone
to actually DO anything!

25:09.320 --> 25:10.840
OK.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.080
Can I read what your last post said?

25:16.960 --> 25:19.760
"For too long, paedophiles,
rapists and murderers

25:19.960 --> 25:21.960
"have been treated as if
they were the victims.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.240
"but enough is enough.

25:24.280 --> 25:27.680
"If the government won't bring back
the death penalty for such crimes,

25:27.880 --> 25:30.600
"perhaps it's time for honest,
law-abiding citizens,

25:30.800 --> 25:33.080
"to take matters into
their own hands."

25:33.280 --> 25:35.520
And then you've put a picture of
Peter Carr

25:35.720 --> 25:38.920
with his work address,
under the headline, "Monster".

25:39.120 --> 25:41.560
But I never said to anyone
to kill him!

25:41.720 --> 25:42.960
So when you said it was time

25:43.160 --> 25:45.440
for people to take matters
into their own hands,

25:45.600 --> 25:46.920
what did you mean, exactly?

25:50.800 --> 25:52.640
I just wanted a job.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.720
I'm 27, and I have
a degree in journalism

25:57.920 --> 26:00.800
that's cost me the
best part of 50 grand.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.960
And I have never

26:03.160 --> 26:06.120
had proper paid work
in my chosen field,

26:06.320 --> 26:09.440
despite having written hundreds
of job applications.

26:09.600 --> 26:12.600
So I was just trying to... shock.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.520
Cos... that's what you need
to do these days.

26:17.720 --> 26:21.000
Otherwise no-one hears you,
no-one listens.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.640
And if no-one listens, what are you?

26:25.960 --> 26:27.360
You're no-one.

26:32.240 --> 26:35.480
In terms of the IPCC
it's a mandatory referral.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.800
I don't really have any choice.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.880
And the case?

26:41.080 --> 26:43.240
The Reid family have reiterated
their faith in you.

26:44.560 --> 26:47.240
For now, the case remains yours.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.880
Thank you.

26:58.920 --> 27:02.720
Oh, just ask the actual
fucking question, Em, please.

27:04.440 --> 27:07.040
Look, I've got ten minutes
before I'm due back,

27:07.240 --> 27:10.840
and I really don't have time for
endless, dreary euphemisms.

27:11.040 --> 27:13.216
You don't have to get so unpleasant,
Dad. Oh, you think?

27:13.240 --> 27:14.800
It's just that, as your father,

27:15.000 --> 27:17.280
I thought you might
already know the answer.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.200
I'm sorry.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.640
I'm very stressed by all of this.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.560
But, no.

27:29.720 --> 27:31.680
I never hit your mum.

27:35.080 --> 27:38.200
Apologies, but I...
have a two o'clock.

27:42.840 --> 27:45.440
And for the avoidance of any doubt,

27:45.640 --> 27:47.960
I'm not a psychopathic murderer,
either.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.400
Just pull the door to,
when you leave.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.840
Love you.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.360
DOOR CLOSES

28:12.360 --> 28:14.280
Els?

28:23.240 --> 28:25.520
If you don't tell me the truth,
Eliot,

28:25.720 --> 28:29.920
I can't continue to protect you.
Like you have for the past 32 years?

28:29.960 --> 28:32.600
Protect me from what? Have you had
a good look at me recently, Dad?

28:32.640 --> 28:34.960
Prison. And I will happily do that.

28:35.160 --> 28:37.320
I will lie for you,
and say I was driving that night.

28:37.360 --> 28:38.720
But you have to tell me the truth.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.400
I've already told you
a million times.

28:40.520 --> 28:41.920
I don't think so.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.600
Yes, I have. I was driving,
I hit something, I don't know what.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.160
I went out to look for it and
couldn't find anything. That's it.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.680
No. Yes! Because you actually
went back that night.

28:49.880 --> 28:52.040
I what?!
I think you actually found her,

28:52.080 --> 28:53.080
and then you hid her,

28:53.160 --> 28:55.320
and then you went back to get
her a few nights later.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.640
What the fuck are you talking about?
Tell me the truth, please, Eliot!

28:59.760 --> 29:02.840
It's been 18 years, I need to hear
it, now, I need to hear the truth!

29:04.520 --> 29:08.120
Where was she found?
Oh, you KNOW where she was found!

29:08.320 --> 29:10.480
I don't! I've been using
since you first called me!

29:10.640 --> 29:11.960
Where was she found?

29:12.160 --> 29:15.120
Tell me, where was she found?!
She was buried in London.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.640
What?

29:29.120 --> 29:30.560
(No.)

29:30.720 --> 29:31.720
What?

29:41.160 --> 29:43.120
DOG BARKS
Come on!

29:47.120 --> 29:49.080
Good boy!

29:53.000 --> 29:56.160
Wooh!
DOG BARKS

30:02.560 --> 30:04.520
Boss.
Yep.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.680
Uh, so, just got off the phone
to Eastleigh nick,

30:07.880 --> 30:09.360
which is the nearest one
to Middenham,

30:09.480 --> 30:13.040
so they've identified our 'G'
as local drug dealer,

30:13.200 --> 30:14.560
nickname 'Gandalf',

30:14.720 --> 30:15.880
real name, Nigel Farndale.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.440
He's got a 30-year record
of drug offences, so they're gonna

30:18.600 --> 30:20.680
pull him up and bring him
straight in. OK. Thank you.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.600
James Hollis is downstairs,
with his son.

30:41.720 --> 30:43.840
For the past 18 years

30:43.880 --> 30:47.520
I have believed that my son
killed Hayley Reid.

30:51.480 --> 30:54.960
Because he did steal my car,
he was drunk,

30:55.160 --> 30:57.080
and when he got back home
at two in the morning

30:57.280 --> 31:00.280
and I found him in his room
in a terrible state,

31:00.440 --> 31:01.840
he told me that he'd hit something.

31:03.400 --> 31:05.600
He said that he'd got out
to see what it was,

31:05.760 --> 31:07.360
but couldn't find anything.

31:07.560 --> 31:10.840
And although his gut instinct told
him that it was just an animal...

31:12.280 --> 31:13.920
..he was also very scared...

31:15.280 --> 31:16.960
..that it might be a person.

31:19.120 --> 31:21.240
Which fear grew, when the next day

31:21.280 --> 31:24.160
news that Hayley Reid was missing
started to filter through.

31:24.320 --> 31:27.240
And the fact they couldn't find her

31:27.400 --> 31:29.000
also, uh... fitted

31:29.160 --> 31:31.120
because the road he was on

31:31.280 --> 31:33.480
was next to the river

31:33.680 --> 31:36.200
which had burst its banks
following the heavy rain.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.760
Meaning we had to consider

31:38.920 --> 31:41.040
the awful possibility...

31:42.200 --> 31:45.040
..that she had been knocked into the
water, washed down the river,

31:45.200 --> 31:46.680
and out to sea.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.440
And for 18 years

31:50.600 --> 31:52.800
he and I have hidden that, uh...

31:53.000 --> 31:56.320
dreadful secret,
and I'm so, so sorry for that.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.280
And then she was found.

31:59.480 --> 32:02.800
The nightmare should have been over.
Except...

32:04.720 --> 32:07.800
INHALES SHARPLY
..instead of finally

32:07.960 --> 32:09.680
believing that he was innocent...

32:11.840 --> 32:16.400
..I started to believe that
not only had he hit her,

32:16.560 --> 32:18.720
but he'd actually found her,

32:18.880 --> 32:20.240
and hidden her

32:20.400 --> 32:23.800
to drive back down a few days later,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.960
retrieve the body...
and bury it in London.

32:29.160 --> 32:30.920
Oh, it, erm...

32:31.120 --> 32:35.520
might seem a terrible thing
to believe about your son.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.520
But...

32:37.680 --> 32:40.560
18 years of this...

32:40.720 --> 32:43.520
toxic secret between us, and...

32:45.320 --> 32:49.040
..seeing the consequences of that in
everything my son has become...

32:52.240 --> 32:54.800
..has made my judgement bad.

32:58.200 --> 33:01.440
And how do you know he didn't do
exactly what you've described?

33:01.640 --> 33:05.040
Because when I finally found him,
just a few hours ago,

33:05.200 --> 33:06.640
and talked to him properly

33:06.840 --> 33:10.360
for the first time since
Hayley had been found...

33:10.560 --> 33:15.520
he reminded me that we
drove back early on the 2nd,

33:15.720 --> 33:17.200
to put him on a
flight to Switzerland

33:17.360 --> 33:19.160
for a school skiing trip.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.800
He was away for ten days.
There will be school records.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.160
He could have driven back
down there once he got back.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.720
By which time the police
and half the world's press

33:27.920 --> 33:30.360
were in Middenham,
so I don't think so.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.120
But, listen, we're not
hiding anymore.

33:33.320 --> 33:36.440
He's here, to answer your questions.
So ask him.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.720
But...

33:40.177 --> 33:43.057
I think he did just hit a deer
that night.

33:45.080 --> 33:48.400
And by me... enabling him

33:48.997 --> 33:51.637
to not face up to his
responsibilities...

33:55.201 --> 33:57.121
..I've messed up his whole life.

34:00.505 --> 34:02.745
For absolutely no reason at all.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.072
So, I'm gonna stay
in the van tonight,

34:11.174 --> 34:13.774
because I want you to have
the time you need,

34:14.239 --> 34:16.120
you know, to absorb everything.

34:17.152 --> 34:20.152
And when might the police know,
do you think...

34:22.679 --> 34:24.400
..that you're not a suspect anymore?

34:25.960 --> 34:27.360
I don't know.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.775
But if it's worth me saying
one more time,

34:30.873 --> 34:32.474
you know, it wasn't me.

34:32.697 --> 34:35.978
Not Hayley Reid, not the
credit card stuff, not anything.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.880
And sometimes...

34:40.040 --> 34:42.159
we have to, you must know this,

34:42.598 --> 34:44.558
we have to accept that...

34:45.449 --> 34:47.929
..that life can be just random,

34:48.159 --> 34:49.679
and cruel,

34:50.135 --> 34:53.560
before being,
in the blink of an eye,

34:53.719 --> 34:55.600
just as randomly wonderful.

35:03.040 --> 35:06.600
SHE SOBS

35:14.600 --> 35:15.760
DOOR CLOSES

35:18.800 --> 35:20.560
CAR LOCK CLICKS

35:23.581 --> 35:24.741
Eliot?

35:24.800 --> 35:26.320
D'you wanna fuck off, Dad?

35:36.320 --> 35:38.312
He's right, I'm afraid.

35:39.004 --> 35:40.882
Within five days
of her disappearance

35:40.969 --> 35:42.369
Middenham was crawling with police,

35:42.413 --> 35:45.663
there were search parties,
choppers with cameras, road blocks,

35:45.780 --> 35:47.440
if she was murdered in Middenham,

35:47.530 --> 35:50.827
it was always my belief she had to
have been moved within a day or so.

35:51.382 --> 35:52.720
KNOCK ON DOOR

35:52.762 --> 35:53.843
Sorry.

35:54.038 --> 35:55.518
They're looking at
their records now,

35:55.648 --> 35:57.928
but the teacher I spoke to
remembers the skiing trip well

35:57.979 --> 35:59.546
and remembers Eliot being on it,

35:59.655 --> 36:01.615
because he was such
a pain in the arse.

36:02.010 --> 36:03.164
Right.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.380
And Nigel Farndale's here.

36:05.866 --> 36:06.913
Thanks.

36:07.720 --> 36:10.160
Did you talk to the son?
Uh, briefly.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.160
And?
My sense was

36:12.320 --> 36:14.440
he is telling the truth.

36:15.680 --> 36:17.920
So for now we're
letting them both go.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.720
I better speak to
this Farndale bloke.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.400
Yeah, I better push off.
No, thank you for coming in.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.640
No worries.

36:30.680 --> 36:34.520
Uh, look, I'm probably gonna head
back down to Hampshire tomorrow,

36:34.720 --> 36:36.280
so...
Right.

36:36.440 --> 36:38.560
But, erm... can I call you?

36:48.920 --> 36:52.040
I don't know if this is a good idea,
right now, John.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.440
I've just got so much...

36:56.800 --> 36:59.360
..c-crap on, right now,
that I need to sort out.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.880
And... I'm not sure starting, uh...

37:04.120 --> 37:06.080
It wouldn't be fair on you.

37:07.440 --> 37:08.880
Sorry.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.560
I'll call you, then.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.760
I mean, we all lived together
for 10, 11 years, Mum,

37:43.960 --> 37:46.160
we never saw him
do anything like...

37:47.320 --> 37:50.480
You know, the photos, were they even
you, or was it make-up, or...?

37:50.640 --> 37:52.000
I dunno.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.040
Help me out here,
cos I'm struggling.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.600
Well...

37:55.800 --> 37:57.960
you're not struggling, Em,
or you wouldn't be here.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.400
You wouldn't have driven five hours
just to ask!

38:03.800 --> 38:06.080
Listen, I know I shouldn't
have asked for the money,

38:06.280 --> 38:09.040
it was stupid, but it was the
first time in nearly 30 years

38:09.200 --> 38:10.960
I felt like I had the upper hand.

38:12.840 --> 38:14.400
And I got a little giddy.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.120
Although...

38:17.560 --> 38:21.480
..for what it's worth,
he never did pay the settlement.

38:23.320 --> 38:26.680
These are the letters
from my lawyer to his.

38:31.240 --> 38:34.080
I instructed mine
to stop fighting in 2005,

38:34.280 --> 38:37.560
after your father put his hands
around my neck, at our old house,

38:37.720 --> 38:39.080
and threatened to kill me.

38:41.520 --> 38:46.000
Of course you and Clare never saw
stuff, I did everything I could

38:46.160 --> 38:48.080
to keep it from you both.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.720
As did he.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.040
For different reasons, obviously.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.040
But that takes its toll,

38:55.200 --> 38:57.200
sweetheart, living that lie.

38:59.160 --> 39:02.840
To keep smiling, as you told me
about all your fun times with him.

39:03.920 --> 39:06.280
The lovely holidays with him.

39:06.440 --> 39:09.240
When I knew... what he really was.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.520
It took its toll on me,

39:13.720 --> 39:16.080
and in turn, my problems
served his deception well.

39:18.160 --> 39:20.960
The photos were genuine, my love.

39:22.240 --> 39:25.320
And you're here now
because some part of you,

39:25.480 --> 39:28.280
some subconscious part,

39:28.480 --> 39:31.040
has always known that
something was wrong.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.760
And it gives me no pleasure at all

39:35.920 --> 39:37.920
to tell you that you are right.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.400
Yes, she came to my house
that night.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.680
Mm-hm. And that was to buy?

39:50.720 --> 39:53.160
In 2000, it would have been E's,
I'd imagine.

39:54.480 --> 39:57.480
You didn't think to mention this
to the police at the time?

39:57.640 --> 40:00.000
I had a house full of gear!

40:00.200 --> 40:02.880
I knew I hadn't done anything wrong,
so...

40:04.080 --> 40:06.200
But, yeah, I'm sorry. I should have.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.320
Do you remember what time
she arrived?

40:11.520 --> 40:14.160
Would have been about...
twenty past eleven.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.840
How do you remember so specifically?

40:17.880 --> 40:21.320
Cos we chatted a bit, maybe
ten minutes, then we left together.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.960
I went to a party in Alcross, which
is about half an hour aways,

40:25.160 --> 40:27.320
and I remember I got there
just as Big Ben was chiming.

40:27.360 --> 40:30.320
And when she left, did she say
where she was going?

40:30.480 --> 40:32.800
She said straight to her party.

40:34.280 --> 40:37.240
Erm, can you...

40:37.440 --> 40:42.560
show me where you were living,
in 1999?

40:45.840 --> 40:48.880
So, if what he's saying is true,

40:49.080 --> 40:51.760
then to get from the Farndales
to the party house,

40:51.960 --> 40:54.680
there's absolutely no reason
for her to be passing the church.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.720
Or where Eliot Hollis was
spotted driving the car.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.080
Which would seem to suggest
James Hollis

41:00.120 --> 41:02.240
is telling the truth,

41:02.280 --> 41:04.560
as was Peter Carr.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.240
Yeah.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.720
As she walked from here to here,

41:09.880 --> 41:11.200
if she encountered anyone,

41:11.400 --> 41:13.760
the more likely it would be
Chris Lowe or Tim Finch.

41:13.960 --> 41:16.200
And I've just come off the phone
to West End Central,

41:16.400 --> 41:20.080
who have detailed records of the
credit card investigation into Lowe,

41:20.240 --> 41:23.640
which they themselves now admit,

41:23.800 --> 41:25.280
with hindsight,

41:25.440 --> 41:26.880
was flawed.

41:27.040 --> 41:29.200
So he didn't just hire good lawyers?

41:29.360 --> 41:30.720
On balance, they think not.

41:30.920 --> 41:33.360
They think he should never
have been charged.

41:33.560 --> 41:36.560
That doesn't mean we eliminate him
as a suspect, of course,

41:36.760 --> 41:39.560
but for now, I think we should
concentrate our fire elsewhere.

41:39.760 --> 41:43.520
And some, erm,
slightly better news here.

41:43.720 --> 41:46.280
Yesterday we got in touch with DVLA
to see if any of our

41:46.480 --> 41:49.600
four main suspects
had any endorsements

41:49.760 --> 41:51.880
for the days after New Year.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.520
And my thinking was,

41:54.680 --> 41:57.120
you have a dead body in your boot,

41:57.320 --> 42:00.760
you might be driving
a little faster than normal.

42:00.960 --> 42:04.920
So here is a copy of Tim Finch's
driving license endorsements,

42:05.080 --> 42:06.600
going back 35 years.

42:06.800 --> 42:09.520
There's four speeding offences
on there, which is kinda normal.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.880
Except for the date
of the second one.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.640
Shit!

42:17.800 --> 42:19.720
The 3rd of January, 2000.

42:19.920 --> 42:22.600
That's the day after
he got back to London.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.520
D'you know where he got it?
Not yet.

42:24.680 --> 42:25.880
They're gonna get back to us.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.880
But that... is a tickle.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.280
That's definitely a tickle.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.360
PHONE RINGS

42:35.560 --> 42:37.000
DI Khan.
'Have you got a pen?'

42:37.160 --> 42:39.160
Yes, yes, I have, yep.

42:39.320 --> 42:41.520
'6:20am, A405 South.'

42:41.720 --> 42:43.440
That is so helpful,
thank you so much.

42:45.280 --> 42:48.360
Ticket was issued at 6:20am
on the A405. Which is where?

42:48.520 --> 42:50.400
Six miles outside of Middenham.

42:50.560 --> 42:52.560
Was he heading to, or from?

42:52.720 --> 42:54.200
From.

43:04.440 --> 43:06.720
KNOCK ON DOOR

43:11.000 --> 43:13.960
Timothy Finch, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murder

43:14.120 --> 43:15.360
of Hayley Reid.

43:15.520 --> 43:16.800
You do not have to say anything,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.160
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention now

43:19.200 --> 43:20.840
something you later
rely on in court.

43:21.040 --> 43:24.560
As you're being arrested, we have
authority to search your premises

43:24.760 --> 43:27.840
under Section 32 of the
Police And Criminal Evidence Act.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.480
Would you like to get dressed,
please?

44:13.120 --> 44:16.080
Why were you on the road
out of Middenham,

44:16.240 --> 44:18.120
heading to London,

44:18.280 --> 44:20.240
at... 6:20am,

44:20.440 --> 44:22.960
the day after
you'd returned to London?

44:23.160 --> 44:27.080
I'd left my laptop in the house
and drove back down to pick it up.

44:27.280 --> 44:29.880
I left very early because
I wanted to be back in time

44:30.040 --> 44:31.120
for morning surgery.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.800
And you'd arranged this
with the lettings agency?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.680
Yes.
They've made no mention of that.

44:36.880 --> 44:39.560
Well, what d'you want me to say?
I arranged it.

44:40.920 --> 44:42.760
Who'd you speak to?

44:42.920 --> 44:44.440
I don't remember, it's...

44:44.600 --> 44:46.320
nearly 20 years ago, erm...

44:46.480 --> 44:47.800
a bloke, I think.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.920
And, what, he took you round there,
did he?

44:51.080 --> 44:52.640
At 6am?

44:52.840 --> 44:55.000
No, he left the key,
under a flowerpot.

44:55.040 --> 44:57.200
Apparently the house was vacant
that week,

44:57.240 --> 44:59.360
and he said to just let myself in.

45:01.040 --> 45:03.240
So why were you speeding?

45:03.440 --> 45:05.496
It had taken longer that
I thought to get down there.

45:05.520 --> 45:07.360
I was running late.
KNOCK ON DOOR

45:08.960 --> 45:11.800
For the purposes of the interview,
DC Collier has entered the room.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.360
Sorry to interrupt, Ma'am.
Can I have a quick word?

45:15.520 --> 45:17.680
Excuse me.

45:17.880 --> 45:21.280
Interview suspended at 8:31.
RECORDER BEEPS

45:25.400 --> 45:27.840
In his cellar, behind
a thousand boxes of junk,

45:28.040 --> 45:30.960
we found one of those old, like,
money box type things.

45:31.160 --> 45:34.040
And when we got it open,
we found these.

45:34.240 --> 45:37.080
A necklace, with hair
still attached to the clasp,

45:37.810 --> 45:39.690
a scrunchie...

45:40.920 --> 45:42.880
..and a pair of knickers.

45:43.305 --> 45:49.536
