00:43.839 --> 00:46.198
Stop whatever you're doing, bud!

00:46.289 --> 00:48.647
We're having a crazy golf
championship in the medilab.

00:48.648 --> 00:49.729
It's going to be insane!

00:50.002 --> 00:51.760
I don't think so!

00:51.761 --> 00:54.201
You won't say that when you
see the course. It's amazing!

00:54.202 --> 00:56.561
Best hole's the fourth,
on the autopsy table.

00:58.201 --> 01:00.320
The bath-lift takes
you up to the tee.

01:00.321 --> 01:02.680
Out of bounds marked
by the commode cushions.

01:02.681 --> 01:04.681
You have to land your drive
over the bunion plasters

01:04.682 --> 01:06.920
in-between
the two kidney donor dishes.

01:06.921 --> 01:10.201
Then a straight shot into the medical
students' practice rectum.

01:12.241 --> 01:14.480
Not now, man.
Can't you see I'm cooking?

01:14.481 --> 01:16.560
Steak? What is it, pork?

01:16.561 --> 01:19.360
I found a deep-freeze down on
B Deck, next to Kryten's quarters.

01:19.361 --> 01:21.920
Enough for me?
Just one steak, one chop, one rib.

01:21.921 --> 01:23.840
Great! Just enough!

01:23.841 --> 01:26.121
Catch you later. Hey!

01:28.641 --> 01:31.481
I'm loving this pork!

01:33.361 --> 01:35.640
Maybe needs a little more soy sauce.

01:35.641 --> 01:37.321
Oww!

01:41.481 --> 01:44.400
Lister, I've been meaning to say...

01:44.401 --> 01:48.120
Books? You've been reading
again, haven't you?

01:48.121 --> 01:50.400
Lister, I've told you
a million times,

01:50.401 --> 01:52.121
don't read, it messes you up.

01:53.401 --> 01:56.200
It's like giving a hamster,
who's only used to his little wheel,

01:56.201 --> 01:58.200
the keys to an Aston Martin.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.600
Crazy things are going to happen.

02:00.601 --> 02:03.200
It's part of my robotics course -
I've got to read it.

02:03.201 --> 02:05.840
Makes you feel so inadequate.

02:05.841 --> 02:07.400
You know Mozart was only five

02:07.401 --> 02:09.919
when he wrote
Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star?

02:09.920 --> 02:13.040
I wasn't even toilet-trained
when I was five.

02:13.041 --> 02:15.201
You've barely mastered it now.

02:16.401 --> 02:19.480
How did these people get to
be so great? I mean, Shakespeare.

02:19.481 --> 02:22.240
I don't understand anything he
wrote, but, man, what a dude!

02:22.241 --> 02:25.320
Plays, poems,
and a whole bunch of expressions.

02:25.321 --> 02:27.281
"A dish fit for a king" -
that was Shakespeare.

02:27.282 --> 02:28.720
What a great expression!

02:28.721 --> 02:30.960
Is it, though?
Is it a great expression?

02:30.961 --> 02:33.199
"A dish fit for a king?"
I say that all the time.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.481
"This is a dish fit for a king!"
That's a great expression.

02:35.482 --> 02:38.840
I love that expression. Shakespeare,
you've got to hand it to him.

02:38.841 --> 02:41.360
He could really write
a good expression.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.560
Who couldn't have thought of that?

02:43.561 --> 02:46.720
"In a pickle" - that was another
Shakespeare expression.

02:46.721 --> 02:49.880
"In a pickle." How brilliant is
that? You know what it means?

02:49.881 --> 02:55.760
As confused as the mixed-up, stewed,
spicy vegetables in a pickle jar.

02:55.761 --> 02:57.280
And how are we supposed to know

02:57.281 --> 03:00.120
what the inside of a 16th-century
pickle jar looks like?

03:00.121 --> 03:01.760
And how is that relevant

03:01.761 --> 03:05.360
to our non-pickly lives
here in deep space today?

03:05.361 --> 03:07.120
When will people learn?

03:07.121 --> 03:09.521
Shakespeare, it's over!

03:11.001 --> 03:12.600
The money that guy must have made

03:12.601 --> 03:14.961
out of a few lousy expressions
and a bad haircut.

03:15.961 --> 03:17.280
Bad haircut?

03:17.281 --> 03:19.920
Don't tell me you haven't
noticed his bad haircut?

03:19.921 --> 03:23.040
But because he's had a few hit
expressions, he gets away with it.

03:23.041 --> 03:26.560
What's wrong with his haircut?
He's got a skullet.

03:26.561 --> 03:28.760
A skull what?

03:28.761 --> 03:30.881
A bald mullet - a skullet.

03:32.481 --> 03:34.601
Bald at the front,
mullet at the back.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.001
You wouldn't want to go out
in public with this guy.

03:38.002 --> 03:40.680
Sirs, the most incredible news!

03:40.681 --> 03:43.760
Someone's died, and you've
been left a new mop? Ohh!

03:43.761 --> 03:45.760
Please, sir, give me some credit.

03:45.761 --> 03:48.400
I'm not the one-dimensional
cleaning droid I once was.

03:48.401 --> 03:51.640
I've evolved into something
far more complex and multi-layered

03:51.641 --> 03:53.721
and, if I may say so, superior.

03:55.481 --> 03:58.480
Stain. Where?
Smudge. Oh, where?!

03:58.481 --> 04:01.560
Smear. Oh!
Speck. Oh, speck!

04:01.561 --> 04:03.321
Smeg. Smeg. Smeg!

04:05.401 --> 04:07.160
The crates were in transit, sir.

04:07.161 --> 04:09.800
I opened the first one and found
this. What is it?

04:09.801 --> 04:12.160
It's a rejuvenation shower, sir.

04:12.161 --> 04:14.400
It rewinds each individual's genome

04:14.401 --> 04:17.160
and returns the body
to any point in its past.

04:17.161 --> 04:20.200
It can restore you
to your physical prime.

04:20.201 --> 04:22.160
Oh, man, how great is that?

04:22.161 --> 04:24.440
I can go back to last Thursday!

04:24.441 --> 04:27.321
Ahh. What?

04:28.401 --> 04:31.400
It's Swedish. So?

04:31.401 --> 04:36.280
It's a flat-pack, self-assembly.
We have to build it ourselves.

04:36.281 --> 04:38.561
"With just an Allen key
and a Phillips screwdriver,

04:38.562 --> 04:41.160
"assembly should take
less than three hours."

04:41.161 --> 04:43.561
That's Swedish for a week.

05:02.001 --> 05:04.480
It's not a million miles away,
you know.

05:04.481 --> 05:07.001
What about all these spare parts
we didn't use?

05:08.201 --> 05:11.000
"Alignment bracket." What
the hell's an alignment bracket?

05:11.001 --> 05:12.921
Oh, look, we have taken
this thing apart

05:12.922 --> 05:14.921
and put it back together
a hundred times.

05:14.922 --> 05:16.240
It's aligned, all right?

05:16.241 --> 05:19.360
In what area is it not aligned?
In no area.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.880
It's good to go, it's aligned,
let's do it.

05:21.881 --> 05:23.480
Who's going to test it?

05:23.481 --> 05:26.640
Hmm, we need something unimportant
and meaningless. Listey, you're up.

05:26.641 --> 05:28.880
There might be something here.

05:28.881 --> 05:30.720
Bits of black plastic,

05:30.721 --> 05:33.360
bits of metal
that don't look important.

05:33.361 --> 05:35.080
Old battery.

05:35.081 --> 05:37.480
What we really need
is something organic,

05:37.481 --> 05:39.880
something alive,
something teeming with life.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.361
Oh, sir, what about your socks?

05:43.081 --> 05:45.201
Stand back, everyone.
They're coming through.

05:46.721 --> 05:50.201
OK, I'm rejuvenating the socks.

05:53.041 --> 05:54.760
Oh! The beams.

05:54.761 --> 05:57.140
We're getting covered in beamer
light.

05:57.172 --> 05:58.372
They're misaligned!

05:58.373 --> 06:01.812
That's what those alignment
brackets were... for!

06:02.892 --> 06:05.011
What's happened? Where are we?

06:05.012 --> 06:09.452
Damn cheap, Swedish, flat-pack,
self-assembly rejuvenation showers!

06:10.532 --> 06:12.012
Where the hell has it sent us?

06:12.013 --> 06:14.771
I fear we may have
time-travelled, sirs.

06:14.772 --> 06:18.091
And I told you those white plastic
clippy things were important!

06:18.092 --> 06:20.731
Trees! This may be Earth!

06:20.732 --> 06:23.491
Earth! It's always Earth
with you guys.

06:23.492 --> 06:25.371
You see some trees, it's Earth.

06:25.372 --> 06:26.971
Who's to say it isn't a planet

06:26.972 --> 06:29.571
entirely populated by
naked warrior cat babes

06:29.572 --> 06:31.651
who need me to make love
to them all?

06:31.652 --> 06:33.411
And what are the chances of that?

06:33.412 --> 06:36.571
If you've never had a dream,
you've never had a dream come true.

06:36.572 --> 06:38.331
Hmm.

06:38.332 --> 06:41.971
We're in a land called Albion, sirs.
Better known as Britain.

06:41.972 --> 06:44.411
And the year is 23 AD.

06:44.412 --> 06:47.891
23 AD. Weren't Britons
all nutters back then?

06:47.892 --> 06:51.251
Running round sporting blue tattoos,
out their heads on booze,

06:51.252 --> 06:53.491
fighting, vomiting and passing out?

06:53.492 --> 06:56.571
A phase that doesn't end
any time soon, sir.

06:56.572 --> 06:58.251
Maybe we can stay.

06:58.252 --> 07:01.211
We've got to get back to the Dwarf
and find Kochanski.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.771
Ah, no fear, sir.

07:02.772 --> 07:04.812
I have the returner remote
right here.

07:06.172 --> 07:08.411
Oh. It doesn't appear to be
functioning.

07:08.412 --> 07:10.292
Does it need a battery,
by any chance?

07:10.293 --> 07:12.372
Eight volts, about yay big.

07:13.612 --> 07:15.131
I'll tell you what.

07:15.132 --> 07:16.611
We'll make a battery.

07:16.612 --> 07:18.331
Out of what, trees and moss?

07:18.332 --> 07:20.851
Out of potatoes.
We did it at school.

07:20.852 --> 07:23.691
A potato, a copper coin
and an iron nail.

07:23.692 --> 07:25.971
We can make a one-volt battery.

07:25.972 --> 07:29.051
Make eight, connect them up, we've
got eight volts and can return home.

07:29.052 --> 07:32.451
Britain in 23 AD, sir,
doesn't have any potatoes

07:32.452 --> 07:35.172
and won't get them until
the 16th century.

07:36.332 --> 07:39.691
Lemons! The exact same battery
but with lemons.

07:39.692 --> 07:43.411
Britain in 23 AD, sir,
doesn't have any lemons either.

07:43.412 --> 07:45.731
They won't get those
until the 14th century.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.411
He's getting closer.

07:47.412 --> 07:49.811
So, where's our nearest lemon?

07:49.812 --> 07:51.451
Best guess, sir, India.

07:51.452 --> 07:53.211
India? How far is that?

07:53.212 --> 07:55.051
4,000 miles, sir.

07:55.052 --> 07:57.571
If we walk briskly,
we'll get there in six months.

07:57.572 --> 07:59.051
Six months?!

07:59.052 --> 08:00.531
I can't wait.

08:00.532 --> 08:02.932
Well, we've got no choice
if we want to get home.

08:02.933 --> 08:06.531
Let's face it, sir.
We're in a real pickle.

08:06.532 --> 08:09.892
Mr Lister, sir. India is this way.

08:30.972 --> 08:32.692
Hey, it's a market.

08:53.212 --> 08:57.131
Ha-ha! I lived in the land of Albion
for ten full cycles of the moon,

08:57.132 --> 09:01.051
but I fled after my family were
dragged screaming from my home

09:01.052 --> 09:02.771
to a mighty wicker tower,

09:02.772 --> 09:05.971
where they were sacrificed
to the three gods,

09:05.972 --> 09:07.971
Toutatis, Esus and Taranis.

09:07.972 --> 09:11.131
First they were garrotted to death,
then they were burnt to death,

09:11.132 --> 09:12.532
then they were drowned to death.

09:12.533 --> 09:15.891
Three deaths to appease
the three gods.

09:15.892 --> 09:19.251
Then the druids drank their blood
and ate their meat

09:19.252 --> 09:22.012
and said the harvest
would be bountiful.

09:23.172 --> 09:25.292
Right. Have you got any lemons?

09:26.972 --> 09:29.332
They're a fruit -
they've not been launched in Europe,

09:29.333 --> 09:31.771
but I've heard
they've been released here.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.011
Ah, lemons!

09:33.012 --> 09:36.011
Oh! Found them! Citrus, citrus!

09:36.012 --> 09:38.011
We come from Albion, through Gaul,

09:38.012 --> 09:41.331
across half the Roman Empire,
Persia, Parthia,

09:41.332 --> 09:43.411
all for this very fruit.

09:43.412 --> 09:45.971
This one here? Is it famous?

09:45.972 --> 09:48.131
No, not that one in particular.

09:48.132 --> 09:50.771
We're in search of
lemons in general.

09:50.772 --> 09:52.971
We've walked 4,000 miles.

09:52.972 --> 09:54.331
How many do you want?

09:54.332 --> 09:55.971
Eight.

09:55.972 --> 09:57.731
Eight?

09:57.732 --> 10:00.691
You walked across half the known
world for eight lemons?

10:00.692 --> 10:04.372
You're right, that's absolutely
insane. Make it ten.

10:06.452 --> 10:09.211
Have you got a bag?
What's a bag?

10:09.212 --> 10:10.892
Bags haven't been invented yet, sir.

10:10.893 --> 10:15.051
In 23 AD, the rich
have satchels made of goat hide.

10:15.052 --> 10:16.532
So what did everyone else do?

10:16.533 --> 10:18.651
They drop things, sir.

10:18.652 --> 10:22.411
Right, what next?
Apart from new feet.

10:22.412 --> 10:25.251
We need copper for the
positive electrode.

10:25.252 --> 10:27.012
Copper? Where are we going
to get copper?

10:27.013 --> 10:29.492
Isn't Britain famous for its copper?

10:30.612 --> 10:33.251
Ahh! No way!

10:33.252 --> 10:36.651
I said we needed a shopping list!
Didn't I say we need a list?

10:36.652 --> 10:39.811
Hang on!
Aren't copper coins made of copper?

10:39.812 --> 10:41.451
He's right!

10:41.452 --> 10:43.371
I think I read that somewhere.

10:43.372 --> 10:45.651
Then we've got copper.

10:45.652 --> 10:48.691
Hee-hee!
Next up, galvanised nails.

10:48.692 --> 10:50.451
And a shave!

10:50.452 --> 10:52.611
Da-da! Hey!

10:52.612 --> 10:56.171
Finally got the sphalerite ore
from a Chinese merchant.

10:56.172 --> 11:00.531
Three weeks for a few lousy nails?
Everything's so damn primitive here.

11:00.532 --> 11:03.531
You have to remember, sir, that many
things have yet to be discovered.

11:03.532 --> 11:07.131
In 23 AD, they still believed
the Earth was flat,

11:07.132 --> 11:09.731
that Tourette's and epilepsy
were caused by demons,

11:09.732 --> 11:13.811
and an oxen had a higher standing
in society than a woman.

11:13.812 --> 11:15.892
Where did the oxen go wrong?!

11:17.172 --> 11:19.971
They had it all
and just threw it all away.

11:19.972 --> 11:23.971
Also, did you know that the
colour purple is a luxury item?

11:23.972 --> 11:27.451
It's made from crushed seashells,
and only the very rich can afford it.

11:27.452 --> 11:29.091
Colour purple?

11:29.092 --> 11:31.611
What's wrong with just mixing
red stuff with blue stuff?

11:31.612 --> 11:35.011
They haven't discovered
that yet, sir. Really? Mm.

11:35.012 --> 11:36.331
Jesus!

11:36.332 --> 11:38.892
Yes? What?

11:43.332 --> 11:47.611
I'm sorry?
I'm just... talking to my mates here.

11:47.612 --> 11:50.452
Oh. My apologies. No worries.

11:52.612 --> 11:54.651
No way!

11:54.652 --> 11:58.371
It can't be, can it?
Don't look! Don't stare!

11:58.372 --> 12:01.651
23 AD - this is when
he was supposed to be alive.

12:01.652 --> 12:04.212
So how old would he be?

12:06.172 --> 12:08.731
Well, let's work it out, shall we?

12:08.732 --> 12:12.012
In 23 AD, he'd be...

12:26.452 --> 12:28.892
23.

12:30.532 --> 12:34.171
That's how old that guy looks.
What's he doing in India?

12:34.172 --> 12:37.251
Shouldn't he be in Nazareth
or somewhere, making tables?

12:37.252 --> 12:39.012
Maybe he's on his gap year.

12:40.612 --> 12:43.010
According to the Bible, sirs,
there was no sight of him

12:43.011 --> 12:45.092
from when he was a young child
to when he was 30.

12:45.093 --> 12:48.372
Oh! So this is like Club 18-30,
the holy version?

12:49.692 --> 12:52.011
The missing years -
I've heard about this.

12:52.012 --> 12:54.731
He toured the world,
perfecting his teachings.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.372
I'm going to get his autograph.
No way!

12:58.372 --> 13:00.611
EBay - it'll be worth a fortune.

13:00.612 --> 13:02.291
You don't even believe in him!

13:02.292 --> 13:04.971
Look, this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

13:04.972 --> 13:06.692
All I'll say is,
"Sorry to be a bore,

13:06.693 --> 13:08.211
"I bet you get this all the time,

13:08.212 --> 13:10.012
"but you're him off the Bible,
aren't you?"

13:11.292 --> 13:12.611
What's wrong with that?

13:12.612 --> 13:14.811
Ah, Rimmer, please, don't say that.

13:14.812 --> 13:16.651
Look, it'll be fine.

13:16.652 --> 13:19.212
We'll get talking, I'll tell him
my middle name's Judas.

13:20.812 --> 13:24.092
One thing could lead to another,
we could wind up big buds.

13:25.252 --> 13:27.052
Why is your middle name Judas?

13:28.212 --> 13:31.212
Judas embodied all the traits
my mum wanted me to have.

13:32.292 --> 13:34.571
Your mum wanted you to
be a two-faced,

13:34.572 --> 13:36.971
double-crossing, conniving snitch?

13:36.972 --> 13:39.291
She must have
been very proud of you.

13:39.292 --> 13:42.411
She was a member of
the Church of Judas.

13:42.412 --> 13:45.651
They believed that Jesus asked
Judas to swap places with him,

13:45.652 --> 13:48.011
so Judas was crucified,
and Jesus was able

13:48.012 --> 13:50.291
to show up the following
Monday and say,

13:50.292 --> 13:52.172
"I'm back, baby! I'm back!"

13:53.252 --> 13:55.291
And nobody noticed?

13:55.292 --> 13:57.251
OK...

13:57.252 --> 14:01.091
Judas's full name was
James Judas Didymus.

14:01.092 --> 14:04.691
James means "twin",
Didymus means "twin".

14:04.692 --> 14:07.171
Judas was Jesus's twin bro.

14:07.172 --> 14:08.931
Jesus had a twin bro?!

14:08.932 --> 14:10.932
According to the Church of Judas.

14:12.172 --> 14:14.211
So Judas sacrificed himself.

14:14.212 --> 14:15.691
And his reputation,

14:15.692 --> 14:19.051
and became someone who was sneered
at and reviled throughout history.

14:19.052 --> 14:20.652
Just like you!

14:23.452 --> 14:24.852
Your mum was really smart!

14:26.452 --> 14:28.451
So what happened to Jesus afterwards?

14:28.452 --> 14:30.612
He went to the South of France
with Mary Magdalene,

14:30.613 --> 14:33.051
had a family and invented the
wheelbarrow.

14:33.052 --> 14:34.811
Here goes!

14:34.812 --> 14:36.451
Rimmer, sit down!

14:36.452 --> 14:37.891
Please, sit! Sit down!

14:37.892 --> 14:43.211
Brothers, brothers, I... fear
thou are impatient for thine food.

14:43.212 --> 14:45.372
Please... join me.

15:30.887 --> 15:33.066
We are all travellers.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.651
Share with me.

15:34.652 --> 15:35.812
Wow!

15:37.132 --> 15:38.852
What an honour!

15:40.012 --> 15:41.651
Incidentally, we know who you are.

15:41.652 --> 15:44.291
Recognised the sandals.

15:44.292 --> 15:46.651
Um, I'm Rimmer.

15:46.652 --> 15:49.291
Um, you can call me Arn or Big Man.

15:49.292 --> 15:51.931
Um... talking of big...

15:51.932 --> 15:53.411
big, big fan of yours.

15:53.412 --> 15:55.092
Big, big fan.

15:56.292 --> 16:00.531
Would the... gladiator
like to... join us too?

16:00.532 --> 16:03.211
I'd be most honoured, sir.
Although I am not a gladiator.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.811
I am a man of peace.

16:04.812 --> 16:05.931
Oh!

16:05.932 --> 16:08.572
- Then thou shall sit next to me.
- Oh!

16:16.452 --> 16:17.772
Ah!

16:19.132 --> 16:21.091
Ah-ha-ha!

16:21.092 --> 16:24.771
Look at all this food!

16:24.772 --> 16:26.492
A dish fit for a king!

16:29.092 --> 16:32.531
You are all from the land of Albion,
I think.

16:32.532 --> 16:35.972
I have visited Albion.
I walked across the River of Mersey.

16:37.292 --> 16:40.811
All those old prams,
it's not hard, is it?

16:40.812 --> 16:42.371
There was a bridge.

16:42.372 --> 16:44.931
Oh, got you. I thought you meant...

16:44.932 --> 16:46.731
Ah! Mine uncle.

16:46.732 --> 16:50.291
When I was returning from the
men's room, I spied two soldiers.

16:50.292 --> 16:53.211
Jesus...
they're on to us.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.291
Problem? Mine enemies are many.

16:55.292 --> 16:57.651
I will slow their path.

16:57.652 --> 17:01.091
Take him from this place
and protect him, I beseech thee.

17:01.092 --> 17:05.330
You shall not pass while there's
a breath left in my body.

17:05.332 --> 17:08.171
For the love I have for my Lord
is like a sea without a shore,

17:08.172 --> 17:10.050
like a sky without a...

17:10.051 --> 17:11.451
I wasn't ready!

17:11.452 --> 17:13.452
I was still speeching!

17:14.972 --> 17:17.691
The only escape from our enemies
is to turn and love them.

17:17.692 --> 17:19.051
Or run. Running's good too.

17:19.053 --> 17:20.732
Down there!

17:34.532 --> 17:36.571
Look, this door isn't
going to hold for long.

17:36.572 --> 17:39.931
I must face them, forgive them
and teach them the gift of love.

17:39.932 --> 17:44.052
And in return, they'll saw off your
limbs and stack 'em in a small pile!

17:45.452 --> 17:46.851
What do we do?

17:46.852 --> 17:48.812
We need to build the lemon battery,

17:48.813 --> 17:50.971
get back to Red Dwarf
and go from there.

17:50.972 --> 17:53.452
What, take JC with us?
Well, we can't leave him here, sir.

17:53.453 --> 17:58.291
No. Leave me. I must face my enemies
alone. I have no fear of death.

17:58.292 --> 18:00.611
Stick with me, kid -
you'll soon change.

18:00.612 --> 18:01.811
Ooh!

18:01.812 --> 18:05.651
Are you OK? I have
pain, but it will pass.

18:05.652 --> 18:09.771
No time to waste, Kryten.
Start wiring the lemons!

18:09.772 --> 18:11.292
We need wire. I'll use my finger.

18:12.972 --> 18:14.932
The gladiator removes his finger?!

18:16.092 --> 18:18.931
It's as if I've smoked some bark
from an acacia tree.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.852
Bad bark. Well bad bark.

18:22.292 --> 18:25.531
It's... Just relax.
We're just making a battery.

18:25.532 --> 18:27.851
It stores energy, sir.

18:27.852 --> 18:31.131
Electromagnetic interactions
between subatomic particles.

18:31.132 --> 18:34.491
Or, to simplify, the copper coin,
which is a ductile metal

18:34.492 --> 18:36.571
with high thermal
and electrical conductivity,

18:36.572 --> 18:38.091
serves as the positive electrode,

18:38.092 --> 18:39.611
and the galvanised nail

18:39.612 --> 18:42.731
is the electron-producing negative
electrode.

18:42.732 --> 18:46.731
The zinc is oxidised and produces
an electrochemical reaction,

18:46.732 --> 18:50.132
which generates an electrical charge,
all from the lemon.

18:51.452 --> 18:53.971
Interesting. I-I have
but one question.

18:53.972 --> 18:55.891
Oh, fire away, sir.

18:55.892 --> 18:57.572
What's a lemon?

18:58.732 --> 19:00.171
Enjoy the moment.

19:00.172 --> 19:01.931
You're no longer the dumb one.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.531
Thanks, bud!

19:03.532 --> 19:05.411
The door's going.

19:05.412 --> 19:08.932
Quick, group together.
Tight circle! Let's go!

19:15.652 --> 19:18.052
Lemons truly are an amazing fruit!

19:19.172 --> 19:20.891
Man, am I glad to be back.

19:20.892 --> 19:22.812
At last I can get
a change of underwear.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.891
These suckers are riding so high,
they'd show up on X-rays.

19:25.892 --> 19:29.211
Suggest we clean up
and then return to 23 AD.

19:29.212 --> 19:32.732
In the meantime, I'll have
a tinker with the rejuve shower.

19:37.652 --> 19:39.571
It is totally amazing.

19:39.572 --> 19:42.491
What are you showing him, the TV?
No. A bag.

19:42.492 --> 19:48.851
You can store any object
into its strange cloth walls

19:48.852 --> 19:50.851
and then carry these objects any...

19:50.852 --> 19:52.571
I'm dizzied by its genius!

19:52.572 --> 19:55.491
Look! Look at the
things than I can...

19:55.492 --> 19:57.091
Ooh. Oooh!

19:57.092 --> 19:58.251
What?

19:58.252 --> 20:00.571
Ah. The demon returns.

20:00.572 --> 20:02.171
Demon? What demon?!

20:02.172 --> 20:04.931
The one that lurks within me
is re-awoken.

20:04.932 --> 20:07.212
Lister, have you given Jesus
a vindaloo?

20:08.372 --> 20:11.611
Course not. We had a jalfrezi.

20:11.612 --> 20:13.451
Where does it hurt, sir?

20:13.452 --> 20:15.011
My back.

20:15.012 --> 20:16.531
And when did it start?

20:16.532 --> 20:20.612
14 nights ago.
It... it sleeps, it wakes.

20:21.732 --> 20:22.852
Excuse me.

20:25.732 --> 20:29.211
Well, we'll need an X-ray to confirm,
but I think he's got a kidney stone.

20:29.212 --> 20:30.731
We may need to operate.

20:30.732 --> 20:33.212
Is it life-threatening?
Depends who's operating.

20:34.812 --> 20:38.051
14 days. Sounds like the
stone's too big to pass.

20:38.052 --> 20:41.691
His kidney could shrivel and die,
and complications could set in.

20:41.692 --> 20:46.091
We get him down the medilab, we fix
him up, we beam him back to AD 23.

20:46.092 --> 20:48.811
What's the problem?
We can't trust the medicomputer, sir.

20:48.812 --> 20:52.011
Remember what happened when you went
for a mumps and rubella injection?

20:52.012 --> 20:54.651
Yeah, I asked for a rube jab,
woke up with a boob job.

20:54.652 --> 20:58.651
Still not right up here.
So, we're going to have to do it.

20:58.652 --> 21:00.011
But we're not qualified.

21:00.012 --> 21:01.731
I'm perfectly qualified, sir.

21:01.732 --> 21:04.251
After all, I've been operating
on Mr Lister for years.

21:04.252 --> 21:06.011
You what?!

21:06.012 --> 21:09.171
Well, not trusting the medicomputer,
sir, what choice do I have?

21:09.172 --> 21:12.211
What kind of operations?
It's all above board, sir.

21:12.212 --> 21:13.932
I asked Mr Rimmer for permission.

21:18.172 --> 21:20.851
Well, sir, you remember that stomach
pain you had a few months ago?

21:20.852 --> 21:24.531
Yeah. You remember the searing
agony you were in? Yeah.

21:24.532 --> 21:26.651
And remember how that
just sort of stopped?

21:26.652 --> 21:27.811
Yeah.

21:27.812 --> 21:32.011
Well, that's because I performed
a splenectomy on you, sir. A what?!

21:32.012 --> 21:33.492
I removed your spleen.

21:34.612 --> 21:36.731
My spleen? You removed my spleen?!

21:36.732 --> 21:38.811
Well, where is it?
I might need that.

21:38.812 --> 21:41.332
It's with the rest of your organs...
in the freezer.

21:43.172 --> 21:45.212
Next to my quarters. On B Deck.

21:56.012 --> 21:57.412
Excuse me.

22:00.572 --> 22:02.931
So, this operation -
what does it involve?

22:02.932 --> 22:07.491
Well, we need to insert a laser
and a ureteroscope up his urethra,

22:07.492 --> 22:09.691
locate the stone and haul it out.

22:09.692 --> 22:12.571
Kryten, the only urethra
I know are Aretha Franklin.

22:12.572 --> 22:14.451
In English.

22:14.452 --> 22:15.851
Here's a hint.

22:15.852 --> 22:19.531
It's the last place any man
wants anyone inserting anything.

22:19.532 --> 22:20.931
You what?

22:20.932 --> 22:23.011
You're stuffing stuff
up his Schneiberhauser?

22:23.012 --> 22:24.812
D'you know who
we're dealing with here?

22:24.813 --> 22:26.812
But, sir, it's a perfectly standard
operation.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.411
Yeah, that's cos you're not a member
of the Schneiberhauser club.

22:29.412 --> 22:31.611
But me, as self-appointed president

22:31.612 --> 22:34.411
of the Schneiberhauser
Owners' Society,

22:34.412 --> 22:37.571
let me tell you,
that is not a standard operation!

22:37.572 --> 22:41.291
Well, perhaps we should inform him
of what we intend to do.

22:41.292 --> 22:44.371
I think he might notice, don't you?
Well, what's the plan?

22:44.372 --> 22:47.451
I keep him talking over dinner
while you disappear under the table?

22:47.452 --> 22:50.611
Best bet for a smooth operation -
he's out cold.

22:50.612 --> 22:52.971
I thought we'd run out of
anaesthetic.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.291
Who needs anaesthetic?

22:54.292 --> 22:56.892
Just tell him what you're going
to do, he'll faint on the spot!

22:58.532 --> 23:00.692
Mr Lister, sir, could you hold this?

23:01.852 --> 23:04.812
I'm not holding it.
I barely know him.

23:06.732 --> 23:09.532
Well, someone's got to hold it
while I insert the camera.

23:10.812 --> 23:14.211
Don't look at me.
I'm done throwing up for today.

23:14.212 --> 23:16.291
Well, then, you'll have to do it,
sir.

23:16.292 --> 23:18.772
I don't want to be a holder.
Why can't I be a shover?

23:18.773 --> 23:21.491
You're not qualified to be a shover,
sir.

23:21.492 --> 23:23.771
I'll hold it.

23:23.772 --> 23:26.531
It'll be an absolute privilege
to hold it.

23:26.532 --> 23:30.331
You what? Pass the barbecue tongs.

23:30.332 --> 23:33.452
This is the high point
of my entire career.

23:39.772 --> 23:42.811
Well, we should let him rest, sirs.
He'll be raring to go in the morning.

23:42.812 --> 23:45.211
Your kindness is boundless.

23:45.212 --> 23:46.771
Need anything doing, just holler.

23:46.772 --> 23:49.811
Books on the table if you get
bored, computer games, feel free.

23:49.812 --> 23:51.852
Just the bag.

23:52.972 --> 23:54.372
Just the bag.

24:02.532 --> 24:04.492
Mr Jesus, sir, good morning!

24:06.932 --> 24:08.691
Mr Jesus?

24:08.692 --> 24:12.892
Oh! He hath risen! Ha! Ooh!

24:14.852 --> 24:16.852
Oh.

24:18.492 --> 24:21.932
Oh, goodness!

24:35.132 --> 24:37.610
Well, who was the idiot
who let him read a history book?

24:37.611 --> 24:38.890
Look, I didn't think.

24:38.891 --> 24:40.772
Didn't it occur to you
that him reading about

24:40.773 --> 24:43.891
how many wars Christianity's caused
might mess him up a bit?

24:43.892 --> 24:45.211
So where is he now?

24:45.212 --> 24:48.651
Well, according to the note,
he's gone back to 23 AD

24:48.652 --> 24:50.491
so he can trash his reputation

24:50.492 --> 24:55.731
so "this Christianity thingeth
never taketh offeth-eth-eth-eth".

24:55.732 --> 24:57.771
What, no Christianity?

24:57.772 --> 25:01.892
What about Christmas?
We've killed Wallace & Gromit!

25:03.772 --> 25:06.091
Trash his reputation?
How can he do that?

25:06.092 --> 25:09.571
Breaking the Ten Commandments might
be a pretty good place to start.

25:09.572 --> 25:10.931
So wait a minute.

25:10.932 --> 25:13.611
He's gone back to 23 AD,
and we can't go and get him

25:13.612 --> 25:15.131
cos he's taken the remote?

25:15.132 --> 25:16.812
We do have a spare, sir.

25:20.332 --> 25:21.612
Erin, Erin, Erin!

25:21.613 --> 25:24.651
Jesus, my boy! Come, come...
I'm looking for my uncle.

25:24.652 --> 25:25.971
Hast thou seen him? No.

25:25.972 --> 25:30.891
If thou seest him, tell him...
that I will be in the tavern,

25:30.892 --> 25:33.091
drinking wine in great plenty

25:33.092 --> 25:36.011
until my legs do the dance
of a newly born camel.

25:36.012 --> 25:40.531
And then my mind will turn
to dark, vile thoughts,

25:40.532 --> 25:42.932
and I'll start coveting
my neighbour's oxen!

25:45.052 --> 25:47.291
That's breaking
the Tenth Commandment, that is.

25:47.292 --> 25:51.211
Oooh! And if there's time,
I might even covet his donkey.

25:51.212 --> 25:54.131
And when I've finished
coveting things,

25:54.132 --> 25:58.611
I might make a small statue out of
wood, and idolise it a bit.

25:58.612 --> 26:01.531
You'd better watch yourself.
God is a jealous god.

26:01.532 --> 26:04.211
You do that, and he won't
just get you, you know.

26:04.212 --> 26:08.651
According to the Second Commandment,
he'll wipe out all your descendants.

26:08.652 --> 26:11.131
Isn't that breaking
the Sixth Commandment?

26:11.132 --> 26:12.691
Thou shalt not kill?

26:12.692 --> 26:16.972
It's not killing. It's genocide.
I think that's OK.

26:20.932 --> 26:24.251
So... doesn't God break
the Tenth Commandment,

26:24.252 --> 26:27.171
wishing people worshipped him
when they worship someone else?

26:27.172 --> 26:30.251
I mean, isn't that coveting the
followers of your neighbour's god?

26:30.252 --> 26:32.331
Don't you try and trip God up.

26:32.332 --> 26:34.731
Look, he wrote those
commandments in a rush.

26:34.732 --> 26:37.611
He didn't have time to get
them proofread.

26:37.612 --> 26:41.011
It's strange,
but these Ten Commandments

26:41.012 --> 26:43.131
seem to ignore the rights

26:43.132 --> 26:45.651
of women and children... Shhh!
..but are big on protecting

26:45.652 --> 26:47.731
the rights of oxen, slave,
and donkey-owners.

26:47.732 --> 26:49.491
Keep it down!

26:49.492 --> 26:53.651
I mean, it's almost as if
a man made up these commandments

26:53.652 --> 26:56.331
to keep a primitive people in check.

26:56.332 --> 26:57.972
There he is! Get him.

26:59.852 --> 27:01.051
Ooh!

27:01.052 --> 27:03.131
Jesus! Stop him!

27:03.132 --> 27:05.812
Stop that man! Jesus!

27:09.932 --> 27:13.251
You want to fight, then, doth thou?
No! Well, put 'em up, then.

27:13.252 --> 27:14.570
Let's see what you've got.

27:14.571 --> 27:17.172
Don't think just because I'm a man of
peace, I can't punch your teeth out.

27:17.173 --> 27:20.612
I'm not fighting you, Jesus.
It'd be like punching Gandhi.

27:28.452 --> 27:31.811
No, no. No, mind my hair!
You... you're messing with my hair!

27:31.812 --> 27:34.051
Look, don't do this.

27:34.052 --> 27:35.731
Why not?

27:35.732 --> 27:39.251
Look, so some stupid people
did some stupid things in your name.

27:39.252 --> 27:41.171
It's not your fault.

27:41.172 --> 27:42.811
You make a lot of people happy.

27:42.812 --> 27:44.251
I mean, look at me.

27:44.252 --> 27:48.411
I presumed that, throughout history,
all famous people were amazing.

27:48.412 --> 27:51.891
And then I met you...
and I realised they're not.

27:51.892 --> 27:53.892
In fact, you're a bit of a knob.

27:55.412 --> 27:56.971
Just like me.

27:56.972 --> 27:59.131
Which means that I'm OK.

27:59.132 --> 28:00.891
Yeah, I don't want to be me.

28:00.892 --> 28:03.010
I don't want to walk down the
street and have people say,

28:03.011 --> 28:04.892
"Oh, look, there's
the Jesus of Caesarea,

28:04.893 --> 28:06.412
"the guy who caused all the wars."

28:07.532 --> 28:09.251
Jesus of Caesarea?

28:09.252 --> 28:11.411
You mean Jesus of Nazareth.

28:11.412 --> 28:13.371
Jesus of Caesarea.

28:13.372 --> 28:16.532
Son of Rachel the fornicator,
Samuel the chicken-stealer.

28:17.612 --> 28:19.611
Samuel the chicken-stealer?

28:19.612 --> 28:21.811
He stole them, not me.
Take it up with him.

28:21.812 --> 28:24.531
I'm always having to leg it
because of him.

28:24.532 --> 28:27.011
Um, is Jesus quite
a popular name around here?

28:27.012 --> 28:28.252
Yeah, there's a few of us.

28:28.253 --> 28:30.371
There's Jesus,
son of John, with a funny nose.

28:30.372 --> 28:32.171
Jesus, son of Luke.

28:32.172 --> 28:34.332
He, er, wraps plant leaves
around the feet of horses.

28:34.333 --> 28:36.092
About 70 of us at the last census.

28:39.052 --> 28:40.892
Does this mean I'm not
the son of God?

28:42.452 --> 28:43.812
Oh, bugger!

28:44.892 --> 28:47.171
Count your blessings!
It's not been all bad.

28:47.172 --> 28:50.412
And how's that? You've had
a little trip to the future.

28:51.532 --> 28:54.172
Take what you've learned
and do something with it.

28:56.252 --> 28:59.331
Get your bags, genuine JC bags,
people!

28:59.332 --> 29:01.611
Come on. Get your bag.

29:01.612 --> 29:04.451
One bowl of goat curry,
then we're out of here.

29:04.452 --> 29:05.692
Hey, check this.

29:07.892 --> 29:10.171
I bid thee good day.
Hast thou booked?

29:10.172 --> 29:12.292
Jesus, table for two.

29:15.532 --> 29:17.611
My brother booked.
It may be in his name.

29:17.612 --> 29:19.291
And his name, sir?

29:19.292 --> 29:20.452
Judas.

29:23.452 --> 29:26.091
Here it is.

29:26.092 --> 29:27.451
Rimmer...

29:27.452 --> 29:28.772
Sit down!

29:31.892 --> 30:19.328
