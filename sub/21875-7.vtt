those potholes purposely.

00:15.010 --> 00:16.180
Oh, then wake up, man.

00:16.180 --> 00:18.380
I told you I was gonna
pick you up at 6.

00:18.380 --> 00:20.610
I didn't get in from Houston
until after 3.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.120
Well, you know what they say
about long-distance romances.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.420
What do they say?

00:24.420 --> 00:25.520
They're deadly.

Not when you're dating
a buyer

this time?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.360
Check it out, man.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.630
A brand-spanking-new pair
of hand-tooled booties. Yeah!

00:35.930 --> 00:37.660
Booties.
That's right. Booties.

00:37.670 --> 00:40.430
I think
they're alligator.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.640
No, they're
not alligator.

00:41.640 --> 00:42.870
But they are a skin

00:42.870 --> 00:45.510
that reminds me
a lot of your humor.

00:45.510 --> 00:46.770

01:26.150 --> 01:28.280
I'll meet you at the bottom.

I don't know.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.390
Didn't talk.

02:08.289 --> 02:09.360
Probably in shock.

it must be a male, man.

14:29.530 --> 14:32.230
Okay, this is it. You've gone
through ten pounds of stew beef.

14:32.230 --> 14:33.870
Get out of here.

14:33.870 --> 14:36.200
Get--
The dog's a leviathan.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.070
'Cause she's still a pup.

14:38.070 --> 14:40.640
Just over half
her natural weight.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.740
She's good
for another 75 pounds.

14:42.740 --> 14:44.840
Hey, remind me
to call my broker

14:44.850 --> 14:46.250
so we can buy
dog food futures.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.850
Here. This is
for her distemper.

14:47.850 --> 14:49.220
She takes one
nights and mornings.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.080
Whoa. Suppositories?

14:52.850 --> 14:55.620
( rings )

14:55.620 --> 14:57.920
Ally Slade.
<i> Honey, this is Connie Tye.</i>

14:57.930 --> 15:00.590
Yeah, put your father on, honey.
I got an emergency here.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.160
I-- I-- I'm sorry.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.630
He's--

15:03.630 --> 15:06.230
Uh, can--? Can I help you?
What's wrong?

15:06.230 --> 15:07.770
My prize cutting horse.
( whinnies )

15:07.770 --> 15:10.040
He's having some kind
of convulsions. I don't know.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.100
Look, um...

15:11.110 --> 15:12.340
I'd like to help you,
but, uh...

15:12.340 --> 15:13.910
(<i> sad, mournful theme playing</i> )

15:13.910 --> 15:15.810
I-- I can't just now.

15:15.810 --> 15:18.180
I'm--

15:18.180 --> 15:21.010
I'm just--
Here, here, here.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.550
Hello.
Ranger Walker.

15:24.550 --> 15:25.920
Ranger what?

15:25.920 --> 15:27.920
Look, I need some help here.
I've got an emergency.

15:29.860 --> 15:30.990
She'll be
right there.

15:30.990 --> 15:34.190
Okay.
( whinnying )

15:41.240 --> 15:42.870
Hey, w-- Wait a minute.

15:42.870 --> 15:44.970
How am I supposed
to do that? I can't--

15:44.970 --> 15:47.010
I can't even get over there.
I don't have a truck.

15:47.010 --> 15:48.940
Well, now you do.

15:48.940 --> 15:51.940
Listen, here's something
my uncle Ray used to say:

15:51.950 --> 15:56.220
when you're hurting,
the best thing to do is work.

15:56.220 --> 15:57.450
Let's go.
Come on.

15:58.790 --> 16:01.750
( grunting )

16:01.760 --> 16:03.390
CONNIE:
It started up
last night.

16:03.390 --> 16:06.190
I heard him whinnying,
and I came out to the barn.

16:06.190 --> 16:08.360
He was shivering, so I--
I blanketed him,

16:08.360 --> 16:11.000
and that's when
the convulsions started.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.930
Abscesses.
All through his mouth.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.670
What is it?

16:17.510 --> 16:18.870
( sighs )

16:18.870 --> 16:20.070
I don't know.

16:26.650 --> 16:28.050
( meows )

16:30.720 --> 16:32.490

Hey, Blue!

16:33.790 --> 16:35.520
( barking )

16:37.360 --> 16:38.360
Blue!

16:42.260 --> 16:44.600
Blue!

16:45.100 --> 16:47.530
( barking )

16:49.070 --> 16:50.840
Blue!

16:51.970 --> 16:53.440
Trespassing, boy?

16:53.440 --> 16:54.510
( gun cocks )

16:54.510 --> 16:56.080
My name is not "boy."

16:56.080 --> 16:59.150
Besides, I had
exigent circumstances.

16:59.150 --> 17:00.710
Just get this hound
off our land.

17:01.650 --> 17:03.320
Man, that dog is ugly.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.520
He's got the face like the east
end of a west-bound mule.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.960
Okay.
I'm gonna leave.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.790
And I'm gonna ignore
the aggravated assault.

17:11.790 --> 17:13.930
But do me a favor,
gentlemen.

17:13.930 --> 17:14.930
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

17:14.930 --> 17:17.400
Don't dis my dog.

17:19.130 --> 17:21.400
Come on, girl.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.369
Come on.

17:24.369 --> 17:25.839
(<i> harmonica playing</i>
<i> playful theme</i> )

17:30.950 --> 17:32.480
Come on.

17:39.490 --> 17:41.490
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

17:44.460 --> 17:46.290
Hold this.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.270
It looks like
Ally's picking up

17:55.270 --> 17:58.270
where her daddy
left off.

17:59.140 --> 18:01.510
Ally cat.

18:01.510 --> 18:04.840
Yeah. The one
curiosity killed.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.790
ALLY:
It just died...

18:12.790 --> 18:14.650
right there
in front of us.

18:14.660 --> 18:17.860
My dad would have
been able to save him.

18:17.860 --> 18:19.890
He had a real instinct
for animals.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.130
All right...

18:21.130 --> 18:25.900
But now it's up to you
to keep on going.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.830
Remember what you said to me?

18:27.840 --> 18:30.470
It said Slade and Slade
on the bag?

18:31.410 --> 18:32.940
( telephone rings )

18:34.840 --> 18:35.840
Walker.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.350
Really?

18:40.550 --> 18:43.120
Okay,
thanks, Billy.

18:49.490 --> 18:51.490
You know...

18:51.490 --> 18:55.730
sometimes we think
our parents can do no wrong.

18:55.730 --> 18:58.800
What's that
supposed to mean?

18:58.800 --> 19:01.170
That was
the Highway Patrol.

19:01.170 --> 19:04.200
Your father has three
convictions for drunk driving.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.510
( scoffs )

19:06.510 --> 19:09.440
Three convictions?

19:09.440 --> 19:10.710
( sighs )

19:10.710 --> 19:12.910
The last one
was six years ago.

19:12.910 --> 19:14.610
It almost killed him.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.920
But he got help.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.780
The man hated liquor.

19:18.790 --> 19:19.790
He wouldn't even go

19:19.790 --> 19:21.520
to a restaurant
where it was served.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.420
All due respect,
Ally, but...

19:23.420 --> 19:28.430
Isn't it possible that he could
have gone off the wagon?

19:32.970 --> 19:34.670
Ally, wait.

19:34.670 --> 19:36.140
Look...

19:36.140 --> 19:37.640
Maybe I did
get out of line.

19:37.640 --> 19:38.740
But look,

19:38.740 --> 19:41.640
will you please
get back in the truck?

19:41.640 --> 19:44.210
Ally, listen--
No, you listen.

19:44.210 --> 19:47.010
Horses don't die
overnight.

19:47.010 --> 19:48.880
There's something
wrong here.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.780
My father tried to stop it,
and he's dead.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.680
Now it's my job.

19:56.990 --> 19:59.760
What is that you say when
a Ranger makes his first case?

19:59.760 --> 20:01.660
He'll do to ride
the river with.
Hm.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.100
You know what
I was thinking?

20:03.100 --> 20:04.260
I'd ride the river
with her...

20:06.200 --> 20:07.630
any day.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.400

<i> Nobody, but nobody...</i>

20:23.350 --> 20:28.290
Come on, Cleveland,

20:28.290 --> 20:30.190
You always root for the Indians,
Uncle Ray?

20:30.190 --> 20:31.360
Always.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.990
Especially if they get
to the World Series

20:32.990 --> 20:34.590
against the Atlanta Braves.

Hm, it's nothing.

20:48.380 --> 20:51.440
That lady horse doctor
you mentioned.

20:51.450 --> 20:55.050
The one with the little ponies.
Is she still on your mind?

20:55.050 --> 20:58.020
What is it about strong-willed
women, Uncle Ray, that...

20:58.020 --> 20:59.720
attracts me?

21:01.660 --> 21:03.390
I sure like them, but...

21:03.390 --> 21:06.230
I'll be danged
if I understand them.

21:06.230 --> 21:08.990
Ah, it's the same thing
with ponies, Washoe.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.200
You wanna tame them,
but if your mount
don't throw you

21:11.200 --> 21:12.560
every once in a while,

21:12.570 --> 21:14.870
what joy is there
in the ride?

21:14.870 --> 21:17.470

21:17.470 --> 21:20.370
Aunt Ruthie was a strong-willed
woman, wasn't she?

21:21.340 --> 21:24.480
Thirty-six winters.

21:24.480 --> 21:27.550
And the ride
was worth every day.

21:57.180 --> 21:59.040

21:59.050 --> 22:01.550
Well, I'll be danged.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.150
You were right, Ally.

I'm gonna kill you!

22:20.170 --> 22:21.370
Hold it!

22:36.780 --> 22:38.250
Take old Blue
to, uh, Animal Control?

22:38.250 --> 22:39.520
Uh-uh.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.490
Closed till Monday.
I left her at C.D.'s.

22:42.490 --> 22:44.560
Great. She'll eat him
out of house and home.

don't dis my dog.

22:48.030 --> 22:49.190

22:50.200 --> 22:51.660
to do what you
did today. None!

22:56.170 --> 22:58.470
Woman, you had no right
to do what you did today.

22:59.970 --> 23:01.870
I'll go around
to the front.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.510
We go in 20 seconds.
Okay.

23:09.150 --> 23:10.650
Ally,
I've done told you

23:10.650 --> 23:12.450
about talking
like that.

23:13.550 --> 23:15.020
Texas Rangers!
You're under arrest!

23:15.020 --> 23:16.620
Get down.
Hands behind
your back!

23:16.620 --> 23:18.990
Move! Move!
Walker, what are you doing!

23:18.990 --> 23:21.090
What am I doing?

23:21.090 --> 23:22.960
I saw you being kidnapped
at the clinic.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.000
Kidnapped?
We didn't kidnap her.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.330
Yeah,
we drug her along,

23:26.330 --> 23:28.670
but we didn't intend
for the law to be involved.

23:28.670 --> 23:31.940
We never meant nothin' to mean
nothin' till you mess up.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.610
Whatever!
Kidnapping's a crime!

23:33.610 --> 23:35.610
Wait a minute!
Hold on!

23:35.610 --> 23:37.610
Walker, Trivette,
I thank you,

23:37.610 --> 23:39.950
but I do not need help
when it comes to Buddy Gathers.

23:39.950 --> 23:41.810
I've been able to take him
since the sixth grade.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.180
What's that
supposed to mean?

23:43.180 --> 23:45.180
They wanted me to come back
with them to their place,

23:45.190 --> 23:46.650
and when I said
I wouldn't go,

23:46.650 --> 23:47.920
Buddy got
a little carried away.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.520
That's kidnapping.

23:49.520 --> 23:50.760
The point is,

23:50.760 --> 23:52.890
I don't need
to press charges or anything.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.360
And I'm glad
that I came out here,

23:54.360 --> 23:56.600
'cause it's brought me closer
to why my father was killed.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.160
Yeah, these are
the guys that did it!

23:58.170 --> 23:59.560
That's a lie!

23:59.570 --> 24:00.830
What are you
talking about?

24:00.840 --> 24:03.140
Okay, look.
Look.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.110
I went out
to the crash site.

24:08.110 --> 24:10.240
I found skid marks.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.480
You were right.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.480
Your father
was forced

24:12.480 --> 24:14.150
off the road.

24:14.150 --> 24:15.150
Thank you.

24:15.150 --> 24:16.250
We didn't have
nothing to do

24:16.250 --> 24:17.420
with doc's crash.

24:17.420 --> 24:18.980
He's right.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.420
Daddy was out here to check--

24:20.420 --> 24:22.820
No! You hush up.
We don't want this getting out.

24:22.820 --> 24:23.860
What getting out?

24:23.860 --> 24:25.460
More livestock...dead.

24:25.460 --> 24:26.660
Woman,
I am warning you.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.590
Come on.
I'll show you.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.900
OLDER GATHERS:
Black Angus.

24:32.900 --> 24:34.730
Six of my best head
just up and died.

24:34.740 --> 24:35.770
Same symptoms:

24:35.770 --> 24:37.340
convulsions,
hair loss

24:37.340 --> 24:39.300
and abscesses
in the mouth.

24:39.310 --> 24:41.970
Called Doc Slade, and he thought
it was the anthrax.

24:42.940 --> 24:43.980
That's why

24:43.980 --> 24:45.080
we brought
Ally here.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.810
To keep her
from talking.

24:46.810 --> 24:47.980
If word like that spread,

24:47.980 --> 24:49.250
nobody would buy our beef.

24:49.250 --> 24:50.380
We'd lose the ranch.

24:50.380 --> 24:53.190
It's been in our family
for six generations.

24:53.190 --> 24:55.690
No way that was
gonna happen.

24:58.390 --> 24:59.390
Trivette.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.560
Bore holes.

25:05.230 --> 25:08.130
This must be where Daddy
took the samples.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.530
Remember
the yellow clay?

25:09.540 --> 25:10.870
Yeah.

25:10.870 --> 25:12.840
Whoever killed
your father

25:12.840 --> 25:14.070
must have switched
the samples

25:14.080 --> 25:16.010
with the ones
we found in the truck.

25:16.010 --> 25:18.080
That's motive
and probable cause.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.780
( gun cocks )
You're under arrest for--

25:19.780 --> 25:21.710
Hold it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.150
They have
the wrong tires.

25:23.150 --> 25:24.820
They have 16-inch
desert duelers.

25:24.820 --> 25:27.120
And the tires on the truck
that killed Dr. Slade

25:27.120 --> 25:28.890
were 20-inch rims.

25:28.890 --> 25:31.890
And besides, barn swallows
don't die from anthrax.

25:31.890 --> 25:34.330
So, what was my father after?

25:34.330 --> 25:37.430
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

25:37.430 --> 25:39.960
And that's to take a test sample
from one of these steers.

25:39.970 --> 25:42.300
Hey, you--
You can't do that.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.600
We can and we will.

25:44.610 --> 25:46.570
Can't we?

C.D., man,
nothing is working on this mud.

Look at this.
Butcher's wax,

25:58.150 --> 25:59.490
mink oil, saddle soap.

25:59.490 --> 26:01.490
It's probably
not just mud.

26:01.490 --> 26:03.320
Look, I may come
from Baltimore, buddy,

26:03.320 --> 26:05.390
but I know dirt
when I see it.

26:05.390 --> 26:07.290
Probably
not just dirt.

26:07.290 --> 26:08.890
Well, then what is it?

26:08.900 --> 26:10.200
Road oil.

26:12.370 --> 26:13.970
Damn it, Jimmy.
That dog has knocked over

26:13.970 --> 26:15.330
that water dish again.

26:15.340 --> 26:17.500
Give me that mop, baby.
Please, honey.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.400
That dog is so blind,

26:19.410 --> 26:21.640
she can't see through
a barbed wire fence.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.140
Her breath is so bad,
it would crack a mirror.

26:24.140 --> 26:27.050
She can pass more gas
than a bull at corn time.

26:27.050 --> 26:30.050

Hey.

Don't dis my dog.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.500
Hey, guys. Did Ally show up
with the test results yet?

26:45.500 --> 26:48.530
Not yet. Cordell,
I think I've got a lead

26:48.540 --> 26:50.000
on those animal deaths.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.110
Over 200 dead animals
in ten years.

26:54.110 --> 26:56.480
And where
they found the carcass,

26:56.480 --> 26:59.240
50 percent of the time,
they spotted a UFO.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.410
Then we're--
We're looking for...

27:01.420 --> 27:02.680
Little green men.
Yeah.

27:02.680 --> 27:03.850

Why not?

27:03.850 --> 27:06.850
We all know that
there are 16 billion

27:06.850 --> 27:09.890

27:09.890 --> 27:13.530
Now, let's assume
that 1,000 of those

27:14.830 --> 27:18.160
You know, watching MTV
and drinking Gatorade.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.570
Stands to reason
they'd need some stock.

27:20.570 --> 27:23.640
Hell, Texas has got the best
stock in the universe.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.100
C.D., you gotta stop reading

27:25.110 --> 27:27.140

27:27.140 --> 27:29.440
Okay. But if aliens didn't do it

27:29.440 --> 27:31.540

27:52.770 --> 27:56.870
Damn. That was Nellie Ashford
out on 421.

27:56.870 --> 27:58.240
She just had
some cattle killed.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.810
Except this time,
she saw who done it.

28:00.810 --> 28:02.140
Who?

28:02.140 --> 28:05.280
Men from Mars.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.810
(<i> slow, ambient theme playing</i> )

Well, uh--
Let me see, uh...

28:25.430 --> 28:28.170
There I was, up on the back 40,

28:28.170 --> 28:30.370
getting ready to call them in,

28:30.370 --> 28:31.670
when I saw it.

28:31.670 --> 28:33.170
Saw what, ma'am?

28:33.170 --> 28:34.440
The ship.

28:34.440 --> 28:37.310
A space vehicle,
I think they call it.

28:37.310 --> 28:39.240
It weren't no saucer, though.

28:39.250 --> 28:42.580
It was long,
with these tentacles

28:42.580 --> 28:46.750
coming off on the back
and them flashing lights.

28:46.750 --> 28:50.420
What exactly makes you think
they were...

28:50.420 --> 28:52.090
What?

28:52.090 --> 28:53.560
Spacemen?

28:53.560 --> 28:55.860
Why, the suits, son.

28:55.860 --> 29:01.170
They's all wearin'
these big, white suits.

29:01.170 --> 29:02.730
Didn't look like ET, though.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.500
Looked more like, uh...

29:04.510 --> 29:06.240
the Pillsbury Doughboy.

All except
for the mother ship.

29:18.390 --> 29:19.920
Mother ship?

29:19.920 --> 29:22.090
There was
this hellish wind,

a close encounter.

30:07.670 --> 30:10.100
Any pattern
to the deaths?

30:10.100 --> 30:11.540
Not so far.

Um, they're all clustered
within a two-mile radius,

30:13.810 --> 30:14.970
but other than that--

30:14.980 --> 30:16.810
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Look at this.

to County Route 421.

It's the same stuff
we saw at the Gathers' place.

It's just road oil.

30:43.570 --> 30:45.500
See, that's what I don't
understand about Texas.

30:51.680 --> 30:52.910
You go to a gas station

30:52.910 --> 30:54.180
and get your oil
changed, right?

30:54.180 --> 30:55.410
And most gas stations
sell it

30:55.420 --> 30:56.610
for a few cents a gallon

30:56.620 --> 30:58.250
to these little
mom-and-pop truckers.

30:58.250 --> 30:59.680
And then places
like this here,

31:22.280 --> 31:23.410
Dioxin?

31:23.410 --> 31:25.310
Yep. They sprayed it
in Vietnam.

31:25.310 --> 31:26.980
Remember Agent Orange?

31:26.980 --> 31:29.650
Some veterans still say
it causes cancer.

Ten years ago,
horses started dying

31:31.620 --> 31:32.880

after they sprayed
dioxin-laced oil

31:34.490 --> 31:35.850

31:35.860 --> 31:37.990
Then how come
it showed up here?

from the war?

the barrels in rows,

in activated charcoal, man.

And half these drums
are empty.

36:32.090 --> 36:34.750
An oil sample.
Here's your warrant.

36:34.750 --> 36:36.550
Oh, is that right,
Rastus?

36:36.560 --> 36:39.290
Maybe you better haul
your black butt outta here

36:39.290 --> 36:41.760
before I spread it
all over this road.

36:41.760 --> 36:42.830
Back off, mac.

36:42.830 --> 36:45.600
Hey, listen, pal,
I can talk to that black--

36:45.600 --> 36:46.870
( gagging )

36:46.870 --> 36:50.170
Be nice and let my partner
do his job.

36:51.570 --> 36:52.800
( gagging )

36:52.810 --> 36:54.240
Get back
in that truck,

36:54.240 --> 36:55.540
or come in swinging, jack.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.550
Got it.

37:02.550 --> 37:05.120
Now get this truck
back to the garage

37:05.120 --> 37:08.920
and don't drop one ounce of oil
on the way, okay?

37:08.920 --> 37:10.720
Or I'm gonna
to come down on you...

37:10.720 --> 37:13.020
real hard.

37:22.700 --> 37:24.700
( men yelling )

37:46.560 --> 37:48.590
Tingley, Cotter,
come here.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.930
I leave you two cretins
in charge for a week,

37:51.930 --> 37:53.400
and the bottom
falls out.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.130
What the hell
are you saying, Nash?

37:55.130 --> 37:56.630
They found dioxin

37:56.640 --> 37:59.040
inside of that cow
we snatched.

37:59.040 --> 38:02.110
You know...

38:02.110 --> 38:03.480
we had a good thing
going here.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.980
They pay us ten,
maybe 20 grand

38:05.980 --> 38:07.480
for a load of toluene,

38:07.480 --> 38:08.610
maybe a bit of benzene,

38:08.610 --> 38:11.180
some trichloroethylene.

38:11.180 --> 38:13.420
We mix it
with waste oil,

38:13.420 --> 38:15.620
and then we spread it
on the road.

38:15.620 --> 38:17.460
Get paid both ends.

38:17.460 --> 38:19.460
Pure profit.

38:19.460 --> 38:21.360
And you two idiots
have gotta screw that up

38:21.360 --> 38:23.730
by picking up
a load of dioxin?

38:23.730 --> 38:26.100
Now we have
the Rangers on us.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.200
Well, what do you want us
to do with it, Nash?

38:28.200 --> 38:31.200
I still got 60 barrels
of that crap left.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.440
I want you to dump it.
Anywhere.

38:33.440 --> 38:35.670
Doesn't matter.
I don't care.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.910
Just lose it.

38:43.350 --> 38:44.850
Get back to work!

38:44.850 --> 38:46.550
MAN:
Start pumping!

38:50.090 --> 38:52.020
Hey, something's
going down.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.760
I just got back
from the landfill.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.990
The place is swarming
with white suits.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.600
We contacted the Bureau
and the EPA,

38:57.600 --> 39:00.000
we got a team
of HAZMAT specialists flying in.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.500
Well, they won't be there long,
so let's go.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.370
C.D., can you
get Alex for us?

39:06.510 --> 39:08.110
( dog groaning )

39:10.640 --> 39:13.010
Oh, no.

39:13.010 --> 39:14.180
What is it?

39:14.180 --> 39:15.650
I think
she's having a seizure.

39:15.650 --> 39:17.450
She must've picked up
some of the dioxin

39:17.450 --> 39:18.780
when she ran onto
Gathers' place.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.720
She's contaminated.
I know it.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.390
( dog whining )

39:24.390 --> 39:26.960
I can't stand
to see another one die.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.830
She's not gonna die.

39:28.830 --> 39:30.660
Ally, come on.
Treat her.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.300
Her glands are swelling.
Take off her collar.

39:33.300 --> 39:35.470
If Daddy was here,
he'd know--

39:35.470 --> 39:37.970
Ally, you can do it.

39:37.970 --> 39:39.970
Just do what you've
been trained to do.

39:39.970 --> 39:42.640
I don't know the treatment
for dioxin exposure.

39:42.640 --> 39:43.880
We'll find it.
We'll find it.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.140
Come on.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.380
Okay. I'll meet you
at the landfill.

39:50.350 --> 39:51.850
Come on.

39:51.850 --> 39:53.790
It's okay.

39:58.090 --> 40:00.230
( men yelling indistinctly )

40:07.970 --> 40:09.500
MAN:
Tom, you seal those barrels?

40:09.500 --> 40:10.770
Hey!

40:17.810 --> 40:20.180
Come on.
Come on, let's move it.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.480
Where's the drop
gonna be?

40:26.490 --> 40:27.850
Great Blue Lake.

40:27.850 --> 40:30.220
Good.
Let's do it.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.690

41:05.560 --> 41:07.560

<i> this is Walker. Over.</i>

41:07.560 --> 41:11.030
Trivette,
can you read me?

41:11.030 --> 41:12.730
<i> Trivette,</i>

41:12.730 --> 41:14.870

41:22.110 --> 41:23.410
Come on!
Let's move it!

41:23.410 --> 41:25.880
We got 3,000 gallons
of this stuff to get rid of!

41:56.940 --> 41:59.510
Thought you said
it was going down here.

41:59.510 --> 42:01.780
We're late. Look,
I'll take the responsibility.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.950
The place is empty.
We are dead in the water.

42:03.950 --> 42:05.820
Look, counselor,
it's just...

42:07.290 --> 42:08.550
Wait a minute.

42:12.190 --> 42:14.560
Walker must have--
I know where they're going!

42:14.560 --> 42:17.190
Turn around! Turn around!

42:17.200 --> 42:18.800
Turn around.

42:20.670 --> 42:23.500
I told you to flush it
and hurry up!

42:23.500 --> 42:25.040
Yes, sir.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.240
Cotter, Tingley,
you come with me.

42:32.780 --> 42:35.310
(<i> fast rock theme playing</i> )

42:58.810 --> 43:01.670
Tingley,
start the car.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.710
Cotter, you dump this stuff
and do it now.

43:12.350 --> 43:13.520
Aah! Cotter!

43:14.520 --> 43:15.620
Throw that lever!

( sirens approaching )

43:29.440 --> 43:31.140

43:48.120 --> 43:50.290
You smoked
old Doc Slade,

43:50.290 --> 43:51.790
poisoned the ground.

43:51.790 --> 43:53.420
Now my dog's dying.

43:53.430 --> 43:55.060
Let me tell you,
if she dies,

43:55.060 --> 43:56.290
I'm gonna personally
make sure

43:56.300 --> 43:57.660
the men
of the African Brotherhood

43:57.660 --> 43:59.760
up in Huntsville
get a key to your cell.

44:00.970 --> 44:02.630
You got that,
Rastus?

44:05.440 --> 44:07.570
You're under arrest, Nash.

44:13.610 --> 44:14.950
Don't even try it.

44:14.950 --> 44:16.050
Stuff it.

44:16.950 --> 44:18.750
( yells )

44:21.760 --> 44:23.950
Get him outta here.

44:27.090 --> 44:30.030
Help! I can't--

44:31.360 --> 44:33.260
Well, who in the hell's
gonna go get him?

44:33.270 --> 44:35.270
Well, you're
the triathlon swimmer.

44:35.270 --> 44:36.530
I'm not going
in there again.

44:36.540 --> 44:37.740
Yes, you are--
No, I'm not.

44:37.740 --> 44:38.840
Yes, you are.

44:38.840 --> 44:40.500
Excuse me.

44:40.510 --> 44:42.410
Not.

44:42.410 --> 44:43.410
Are.

44:43.410 --> 44:44.580
Not.

44:44.580 --> 44:46.040
You are.

44:46.050 --> 44:47.710
I can't believe
you got her well so fast.

44:47.710 --> 44:49.050
I got lucky.

44:49.050 --> 44:51.080
She hadn't fully
absorbed the dioxin,

44:51.080 --> 44:53.380
so I flushed her stomach
with charcoal and sorbitol.

44:53.390 --> 44:55.390
Gave her a sedative,
and three hours later,

44:55.390 --> 44:57.150
she was pawing
at my fridge.

44:58.390 --> 45:01.060
Uh, this is for you.

45:02.230 --> 45:04.230
What's this for?

45:04.230 --> 45:06.930
Just kind of a way
of saying thanks for...

45:06.930 --> 45:08.530
all your help.

45:08.530 --> 45:10.700
And being one heck
of a vet too.

45:10.700 --> 45:12.170

Let me see 'em.

45:38.800 --> 45:41.500
What's the problem,
Ranger?

45:41.500 --> 45:43.630
Why'd you try
and kill this dog?

45:43.640 --> 45:45.840
Well, she couldn't hunt.

45:45.840 --> 45:48.310
I'd drop a bird,
she'd just sit there.

45:48.310 --> 45:49.540
Lazy hound.

45:49.540 --> 45:52.310
All she do is lay around,
eat and break wind.

45:52.310 --> 45:54.510
Well, she's trained now.

45:54.510 --> 45:57.450

What'd you tell her?

46:18.100 --> 46:20.340

a pork chop in his pocket.
