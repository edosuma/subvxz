WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.008
(crickets chirping)

00:10.010 --> 00:11.971
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

00:12.012 --> 00:13.556
(phones ringing)

00:13.597 --> 00:15.141
Could've waited till morning.

00:15.141 --> 00:18.018
No, it couldn't.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.770
What'd she shoplift?

00:19.812 --> 00:21.188
Perfume.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.942
She's in here.

00:27.403 --> 00:29.530
I didn't take anything
from that fucking store.

00:29.572 --> 00:30.823
You're not being charged.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.116
So can I go?

00:34.744 --> 00:36.412
Tell me about the compound.

00:36.454 --> 00:38.831
They flew you south,
Imperial Valley?

00:40.416 --> 00:42.376
I could really use a bump.

00:42.418 --> 00:44.920
Soon as we're done here, the
doctor'll give you something.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.505
Suboxone?

00:48.132 --> 00:50.217
Shit, I might as well
snort a Splenda.

00:50.259 --> 00:53.554
You see anything from the plane?
Any landmarks?

00:53.596 --> 00:55.931
(exhales)

00:55.973 --> 00:57.475
It's a shithole.

00:57.516 --> 00:58.893
In the middle of nowhere.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.269
Mountains? Desert?

01:00.311 --> 01:03.147
Desert.

01:03.189 --> 01:06.942
There was a... stretch of water
as we were coming down.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.277
Like a lake?

01:08.319 --> 01:09.612
I guess.

01:09.653 --> 01:10.946
After you landed?

01:12.823 --> 01:15.451
-They drove us up
into the hills.
-How long a drive?

01:15.451 --> 01:17.620
Who knows?
It felt like forever.

01:17.661 --> 01:20.748
The compound... how many shills?

01:22.750 --> 01:25.127
-Couple of dozen, maybe.
-The guys running it?

01:26.170 --> 01:27.421
Five or six.

01:27.463 --> 01:28.672
Armed?

01:28.714 --> 01:30.966
Oh, yeah.

01:32.635 --> 01:35.054
(exhales)
What'd it look like?

01:36.096 --> 01:39.058
Broke-down cars...

01:39.099 --> 01:40.810
tents...

01:40.851 --> 01:43.103
an old bus... a double-wide.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.397
-Double-wide?
-Clubhouse.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.857
Where they drink, play cards.

01:49.777 --> 01:54.615
And where you could
fuck your way to extra Oxy.

01:54.657 --> 01:56.158
If you were so inclined.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.205
Anything else?

02:03.082 --> 02:05.626
-(exhales)
-Close your eyes.

02:05.668 --> 02:08.087
Sometimes it helps
bring back an image.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.463
Mm.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.350
Sorry, I...

02:23.060 --> 02:25.521
That's all I got.

02:25.563 --> 02:27.231
(exhales)

02:27.273 --> 02:28.274
Try again.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.826
(dog barking)

03:00.306 --> 03:02.391
God, it stinks in here.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.518
Rise and shine, assholes.

03:06.312 --> 03:07.688
Come on.

03:07.730 --> 03:09.732
Early start today.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.735
-(men groaning)
-CARTER: Wakey, wakey!

03:12.776 --> 03:14.194
Get the fuck up.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.797
(whispering):
Oh, fuck.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.970
I thought I dreamed you.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.640
Still here.

03:49.939 --> 03:51.899
I remembered something.

03:56.528 --> 03:59.573
We were driving past...

03:59.615 --> 04:03.744
this trippy concrete mountain.

04:03.786 --> 04:05.079
Bright colors...

04:05.120 --> 04:06.538
stripes...

04:06.580 --> 04:08.540
Jesus slogans.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.710
"God is love."

04:15.297 --> 04:18.592
There's a big-ass cross
on the top.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.469
We'll check it out.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.847
Maybe I dreamed it.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.891
(engine idling)

04:58.465 --> 05:00.467
(animal chitters)

05:28.328 --> 05:29.872
Reilly, grab your shit.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.967
End of the line.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.638
-What's this?
-You're going home.

-It is.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.947
I have a call into the DEA
for sat photos.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.158
Hopefully you'll be able
to pick out the compound.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.619
Okay.

08:57.663 --> 09:00.332

You sound so blasé.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.505
(scoffs)

09:06.546 --> 09:08.548
It's juking the stats.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.260
Not uncommon.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.136
What? I don't condone it.

09:13.178 --> 09:16.765
I... I do what I can.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.686
It's not the way
the criminal justice system

09:20.727 --> 09:22.729
is supposed to work.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.816
Welcome to the real world.

Oh, God. I am late.

Oh, my God.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.636
You okay?

09:58.682 --> 10:00.142
It's not true, you know.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.602
Okay.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.230
I'm sorry about the party.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.233
Yeah, I, uh...

10:08.275 --> 10:10.152
Look, I hope nothing happened
that...

10:10.193 --> 10:11.611
-made you want to leave.
-No.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.780
No.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.532
I should have said
goodbye when I left.

10:15.574 --> 10:16.783
That was rude.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.079
I had fun.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.998
Until you didn't.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.625
Thanks for inviting me.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.797
Well, I'll, uh...
I'll see you later.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.041
Tell me this is bullshit.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.380
Fucking cop.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.882
Time to jump, cop.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.432
Unbuckle your belt.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.308
No fucking way!

12:05.350 --> 12:06.768
Get the fuck up!

12:10.397 --> 12:11.815
Get the fuck up!

13:11.416 --> 13:13.752

13:44.616 --> 13:46.201
Kill me, you kill yourself.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.036
I'm a fucking cop, asshole.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.497
Take us back to L.A.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.378
Any airport out-out there
reading this?

13:56.419 --> 13:57.963
MAN (over radio):
This is Imperial County Airport.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.381
Go ahead.

13:59.422 --> 14:02.968
This is Detective
Harry Bosch, LAPD,

14:03.009 --> 14:06.346
badge number 2-niner-niner-7.

14:06.388 --> 14:11.768
In-air incident, one passenger
dead, one missing, Salton Sea.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.604
Contact Hollywood Division
watch command,

14:14.646 --> 14:18.984
advise, I am inbound
to Whiteman Airport. Out.

14:30.996 --> 14:32.872
EDGAR (over phone): DEA came
through with sat photos.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.499
Okay, you sure it's the place?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.167
You can see
the compound clear as day.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.836
(sighs) I got to tell
the brass, J. Edgar.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.629
Admit we fucked up.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.132
Well-- before you pull that
trigger, let me get down there,

14:42.173 --> 14:43.550
coordinate with the locals.

14:43.592 --> 14:44.926
I can't keep it secret
any longer.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.469
We need full resources
on this now.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.847
But we don't know
if Harry's compromised.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.141
Yeah, we don't know anything.
That's my point.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.767
EDGAR:
L.T.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.270
Look, time's up. I'm sorry.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.897
Hang on.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.570
Um, air traffic just called.

15:03.612 --> 15:06.823
Seems Detective Harry Bosch
is on a plane

15:06.865 --> 15:08.408
incoming to Whiteman Airport,

15:08.450 --> 15:10.243
requesting units
and a supervisor.

15:10.285 --> 15:14.247
Okay, forget what I just said.
Uh, Harry is on his way in.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.082
Meet me at Whiteman Airport.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.126
Roger that.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.961
Thanks, Mank.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.588
You know what? Um...

15:21.630 --> 15:24.299
Keep this under your hat
until further notice.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.261
Keep...

15:28.303 --> 15:29.929
MAN: I don't know, I don't know.
They'll be here

15:29.971 --> 15:32.390
-in half an hour.
-Fuck me.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.856
How much longer?

15:39.898 --> 15:43.360
At least two more trips. Why?

15:43.401 --> 15:45.737
Our guy at Whiteman just called.
Twin Otter's on approach.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.573
One passenger dead,
another tossed into the sea.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.742
What the fuck happened?

15:50.784 --> 15:52.744
I don't fucking know.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.996
But the fucking cop
called it in.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.083
We got to move.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.710
-Now?
-We just gonna leave
all this shit?

16:00.752 --> 16:03.088
We're gonna do what we have to.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.757
Everything we've been
working for?

16:05.799 --> 16:07.884
Surviving this,
that's everything.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.719
(engine starts)

16:29.447 --> 16:33.118
-Detective Edgar.
-Agent Hovan,
Lieutenant Billets.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.744
Now you're interested.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.205
Fentanyl. The magic word.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.005
(sirens wailing)

17:10.196 --> 17:12.198
BOSCH:
Get out.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.035
I searched.

17:19.581 --> 17:22.500
We need to clear the plane.
Anyone else inside?

17:22.542 --> 17:24.169
Nobody alive.

17:36.848 --> 17:37.974
Harry.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.810
BILLETS:
You okay?

17:40.852 --> 17:42.479
Got to wash my hands.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.692
Blips and squirrel shit, right?

17:47.734 --> 17:50.278
Mea culpa.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.280
Would love to debrief.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.492
Yeah, well, he's got to do
his walkthrough with FID first.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.495
I can wait. I'll get my people
out here, talk to the pilot,

17:58.536 --> 18:00.330
go through the plane.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.998
Soon as you're able.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.209
Tell FID I need a few minutes.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.835
Call I got to make.

18:05.877 --> 18:08.505
You got it.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.507
Judgment call.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.926
I would've done the same.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.969
Thanks, brother.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.112
(phone ringing)

18:35.240 --> 18:36.825
Dad, are you okay?

18:36.866 --> 18:39.619
-Where are you?
-I'm fine.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.454
Sorry, I didn't have a phone.

18:41.496 --> 18:44.290
For two days? I thought...

18:44.332 --> 18:45.917
What happened?

18:45.959 --> 18:48.795
Lot to explain. Talk tonight?

18:50.630 --> 18:54.133
Mads? Mads?

18:54.175 --> 18:56.553
Did you bust the bad guys?

18:56.594 --> 18:58.763
I did.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.640
Then I guess it was worth it.

19:00.682 --> 19:03.059
Yeah.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.978
Tell you the whole story
tonight.

19:05.019 --> 19:07.689
I got to go.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.441
I...

19:18.324 --> 19:20.243
Spencer is in the wind.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.078
Not surprising.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.831
House is empty, cars are gone.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.249
Work?

19:26.291 --> 19:27.876
Called in sick
for the last two days.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.544
So did his wife.

19:29.586 --> 19:33.506
They'll keep him incommunicado
until the hearing's over.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.636
If they stashed him,
he could be anywhere.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.975
He's somewhere
the Cronyns control.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.940
Flying let them dip in and out.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.276
Kept the Russians
at arm's length.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.194
The Armenians, too.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.322
And you.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.658
And us. We had no idea.

20:00.700 --> 20:04.287
They were talking about moving
their operations to Glamis.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.539
Getting out
of the pill shill racket.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.583
Fentanyl's where
the money's at now.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.461
-Catch anybody at that camp?
-No.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.421
But they left
all their fixings behind.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.048
That's gonna hurt.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.675
I'm sure they're not
too happy about that.

20:19.636 --> 20:20.970
Did you catch a bead
on the head man?

20:21.012 --> 20:22.764
Called him Walsh.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.223
English accent.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.642
Pilot, I think.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.769
Said he flew black ops
back in the day.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.020
Central America.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.274
You know him?

20:34.734 --> 20:37.737
There's a CIA contract guy,
a Brit.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.073
Flew arms to the Contras.

20:40.114 --> 20:44.202
Then the cartels hired him
in the mid-'90s, went rogue.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.329
Killed one of El Chapo's
lieutenants,

20:46.371 --> 20:49.582
-took over his routes.
-Ambitious.

20:49.624 --> 20:51.417
Suicidal.

20:51.459 --> 20:54.003
No one's seen Walsh in years.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.756
We figured he got popped.

20:56.798 --> 21:00.134
Nah. He's walking upright.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.679
But when you do find him,

21:02.720 --> 21:05.264
I want a piece.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.773
(door closes)

21:19.278 --> 21:21.489
-Hey.
-Hey, yourself.

21:21.531 --> 21:23.074
Hey. How's Bosch?

21:23.116 --> 21:26.035
Safe. So, ballistics back?

21:26.077 --> 21:28.454
Hart's gun didn't match
either pharmacy weapon.

21:28.496 --> 21:32.041
-Shit.
-But DNA from one
of the ski masks does.

21:32.083 --> 21:35.712
Well, get back up there,
lock Hart into a statement.

21:35.753 --> 21:38.339
Well, he's not talking but
he hasn't lawyered up either.

21:38.381 --> 21:39.799
All right, be persuasive.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.349
Crate.

21:51.894 --> 21:55.773
Passing the hat for a surprise
going-away soiree

21:55.815 --> 21:58.109
for my erstwhile partner.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.778
Ooh. What, big blowout
at the academy?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.780
Boardner's. Friends and family.

22:02.822 --> 22:07.452
Okay, so, what,
like, 20, 30 bucks?

22:07.493 --> 22:10.455
Uh, I was thinking
more like a C-note.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.999
(sighs)
A hundred?

22:13.041 --> 22:15.835
On account of you stuck us
in CAPs.

22:23.384 --> 22:26.012
Thank you.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.726
They had a previous encounter.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.562
What kind of encounter?

22:34.604 --> 22:37.899
A run-in. It's documented.

22:37.940 --> 22:40.610
Body cam.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.278
That could tip the scales.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.240
Look, if you don't file,

22:46.282 --> 22:49.494
you'll take some short-term heat
from the activists, to be sure.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.579
But they're not
going to abandon you.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.372
And in the future,
you'll benefit.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.750
How so?

22:57.376 --> 22:59.420
From your reputation as a fair
and a measured advocate

22:59.462 --> 23:01.339
for the people of Los Angeles.

23:01.380 --> 23:05.968
And those people include cops.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.767
(door opens)

23:12.809 --> 23:14.936
(door closes)

23:18.356 --> 23:21.567
(phone ringing)

23:21.609 --> 23:22.610
Yeah?

23:22.652 --> 23:24.237
Where have you been?

23:24.278 --> 23:27.240
Working my pharmacy homicide.

23:27.281 --> 23:28.991
Did you know
Anderson was chasing this down?

23:29.033 --> 23:31.285
That's why I've been trying
to get in touch with you.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.371
That hatchet job blew my cover.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.373
Almost cost me my fucking life.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.251
Well, I'm glad you're all right.

23:38.292 --> 23:40.044
Was it Cronyn that tipped him?

23:40.086 --> 23:42.922
Well, if it was, it backfired.
Works in our favor.

23:42.964 --> 23:45.550
I'm gonna need you to explain
that to me, Counselor,

23:45.591 --> 23:47.510
'cause from where I sit,

23:47.552 --> 23:50.721
their plan to destroy my life
is a rip-roaring success.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.766
The piece goes right
to your reputation.

23:53.808 --> 23:56.310
Now I can argue
you deserve your day in court

23:56.352 --> 23:58.229
to answer these allegations.

23:58.271 --> 23:59.397
We have standing?

23:59.438 --> 24:00.398
CHANDLER:
We will.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.941
Practice your outrage.

24:01.983 --> 24:03.359
I don't need to practice.

24:03.401 --> 24:06.779
Uh, did you get my messages
about Spencer?

24:06.821 --> 24:08.865
Can we prove the Cronyns
leveraged him?

24:08.906 --> 24:11.159
Well, first we have
to find the man.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.078
Hector's running down
all the Cronyns' properties.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.205
Then we need to convince him
to testify

24:16.247 --> 24:19.292
and explain how Olmer's DNA
came to be on the handkerchief.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.169
Yeah, I'll have
to get back to you on that.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.087
Bosch.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.047
BOSCH:
Yeah.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.966
The part about you
almost getting killed.

24:27.008 --> 24:29.886
Hyperbole, I hope?

24:29.927 --> 24:31.679
Listen, I'm at home now, so...

24:31.721 --> 24:34.056
I'm sure your daughter's
relieved.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.934
Go be with her.
Good night.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.179
To your golden years.

25:13.221 --> 25:14.347
Stick it in your ear.

25:14.388 --> 25:15.348
(chuckling)

25:15.389 --> 25:17.016
Salud.

25:19.185 --> 25:23.105
So, tell me, what are you
gonna do in your dotage?

25:23.147 --> 25:25.441
Why do I have to do anything?

25:25.483 --> 25:29.445
Oh, you know. Fixed income.
Alimony for three ex-wives.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.781
Unfortunate time-share situation
in Corpus Christi.

25:31.822 --> 25:35.201
(grumbles)
Hurricane fucking Harvey.

25:35.243 --> 25:37.870
I've just seen guys go
down this road. You know?

25:37.912 --> 25:41.540
A few months of
carefree fishing and bowling.

25:41.582 --> 25:44.460
Puttering around the house.
Sleeping late.

25:44.502 --> 25:46.963
Siestas in the Barcalounger.

25:47.004 --> 25:51.175
And then, suddenly,
whew, reality dawns.

25:51.217 --> 25:52.843
Panic ensues.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.304
-(chuckles) Part-time job?
-You guys good over here?

25:55.346 --> 25:58.808
Fuck that, I am not wearing
a blue vest at Walmart.

25:58.849 --> 26:01.477
Oh, no, heaven forfend, no.

26:01.519 --> 26:04.063
Crossing guard.

26:04.105 --> 26:08.526
You're just a bright bowl
of optimism, Mank.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.903
I'm sure you've done the math.

26:14.115 --> 26:18.160
Britney. Uno mas.

26:26.961 --> 26:28.963
You're late.

26:38.723 --> 26:40.433
You okay?

26:40.474 --> 26:41.934
Waited up for you.

26:42.977 --> 26:45.104
I had plans.

26:45.146 --> 26:47.273
Yeah, well, we said
we were gonna talk.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.570
It's late. I'm going to bed.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.781
Look, Mads, I'm sorry
I worried you. I am.

26:55.823 --> 26:58.743
I hate like hell that I did.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.412
I wanted to call,
but I couldn't.

27:01.454 --> 27:02.705
I couldn't risk it.

27:04.165 --> 27:06.167
I understand.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.255
Is that from a fight?

27:11.297 --> 27:16.010
Yeah.

27:16.052 --> 27:17.762
Did you kill someone?

27:19.680 --> 27:21.682
I did.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.562
They were trying to kill me.

27:26.604 --> 27:28.314
Gave me no choice.

27:32.902 --> 27:34.487
How many people have you killed?

27:34.528 --> 27:37.198
Why the hell would you ask
a question like that?

27:40.159 --> 27:42.370
Because that's how many times
I've almost lost you.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.920
So, what's happening
with your case?

27:54.090 --> 27:56.967
Last-minute plea bargain.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.095
Tribe thought some of the jurors
were iffy

27:59.136 --> 28:00.805
about the-the gun, so...

28:00.846 --> 28:03.265
How long?

28:03.307 --> 28:05.351
Eight years.

28:05.393 --> 28:07.228
Doesn't seem like enough.

28:07.269 --> 28:11.524
He's going to prison.
She gets some justice.

28:11.565 --> 28:14.860
That's all you can
hope for, sometimes.

28:14.902 --> 28:17.822
That's what everyone
keeps saying.

28:21.325 --> 28:23.911
And you changed the subject.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.550
(ice clinking)

28:41.303 --> 28:43.305
(sighs)

29:02.658 --> 29:04.660
(indistinct chatter)

29:07.955 --> 29:09.957
Sir.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.719
Chief.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.346
Captain Cooper. Sit.

29:35.733 --> 29:39.278
I got a call last night from
the Imperial Valley Sheriff.

29:39.320 --> 29:43.282
Chief, if I could put this
into some context...

29:43.324 --> 29:45.951
There will be, down the road,
a formal inquiry into

29:45.993 --> 29:49.371
Detectives Bosch and Edgar's
misadventures in the desert.

29:49.413 --> 29:50.706
But this isn't it.

29:52.041 --> 29:54.001
Tell me where we are now.

29:54.043 --> 29:56.337
Well, we have one
of the pharmacy killers

29:56.378 --> 29:58.130
in custody in Bakersfield.

29:58.172 --> 30:00.174
And we're dredging
the Salton Sea for the other.

30:00.216 --> 30:03.302
And Bosch?

30:03.344 --> 30:05.763
Pilot corroborates his version
of the events, sir.

30:05.804 --> 30:09.475
So far, FID sees nothing
out of policy.

30:09.517 --> 30:12.269
Except how he happened to be
on that plane to begin with.

30:16.273 --> 30:17.816
There's that.

30:17.858 --> 30:21.070
And Garcia Clinic
and the pill mill operation?

30:21.111 --> 30:24.365
-Closed down.
-COOPER: DEA has jurisdiction.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.200
Our people will shadow.

30:26.242 --> 30:29.495
Okay.

30:29.537 --> 30:33.123
So let's talk about
who knew what, when.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.924
Okay, Bosch and Edgar made
a field decision

30:41.966 --> 30:44.802
to pursue homicide suspects
into the desert.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.720
Failing to notify
the local authorities.

30:46.762 --> 30:50.599
They were waiting to see
which locals would be impacted.

30:50.641 --> 30:52.226
-But they did have a time frame.
-Which was?

30:52.268 --> 30:55.479
When it became clear that Bosch
was late reporting,

30:55.521 --> 30:57.982
Edgar called me.

30:58.023 --> 31:03.279
And before I could inform
my captain, Bosch called in.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.780
He was safe and on his way back.

31:07.283 --> 31:09.159
Captain?

31:10.202 --> 31:12.830
It's all accurate, sir.

31:16.292 --> 31:20.045
-They'll both get days.
-They're expecting that.

31:20.087 --> 31:24.800
Now... quit the bullshit

31:24.842 --> 31:28.637
and tell me what the fuck
really happened.

31:31.015 --> 31:33.017
(sighs)

32:01.170 --> 32:04.506
(phone ringing)

32:06.967 --> 32:08.469
-Bosch.
-SANCHEZ: Detective.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.220
It's Sanchez, DOC Corcoran.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.681
-Oh, yeah, thanks for
getting back to me.
-SANCHEZ: No problem.

32:12.723 --> 32:14.725
I love having my boss up my ass
on my day off.

32:14.767 --> 32:19.229
Yeah, listen, uh, you mentioned
before that Lucas Olmer

32:19.271 --> 32:20.981
had a hard time

32:21.023 --> 32:22.900
hanging onto that pen
when he signed that confession.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.234
Yeah, he was real sick.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.444
He was weak. Kept dropping it.

32:25.486 --> 32:27.196
Lawyer help him with that?

32:27.237 --> 32:29.198
Well, he didn't hold it for him,
if that's what you're asking.

32:29.239 --> 32:30.991
He dried his hands
so he could get a grip.

32:31.033 --> 32:33.452
Why'd Cronyn dry Olmer's hands?

32:33.494 --> 32:36.121
Well, Olmer was sweaty,
feverish.

32:36.163 --> 32:38.499
What'd he use? Paper towel?
Tissue?

32:38.540 --> 32:40.793
-Handkerchief.
-His own?

32:40.834 --> 32:42.336
Pulled it out of his pocket.

32:42.378 --> 32:45.005
-What'd he do with it after?
-What do you mean?

32:45.047 --> 32:46.423
I mean, did he put it back
in his pocket,

32:46.465 --> 32:48.342
or did he put it in a paper bag?

32:48.384 --> 32:50.719
How'd you know about the bag?

32:50.761 --> 32:53.764
You said he had MRSA.
I would've burned it.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.140
Fucking A.

32:55.182 --> 32:57.226
Thanks, Sanchez.

33:21.458 --> 33:24.169
Need a hand?

33:24.211 --> 33:27.047
I got it, thank you.
Been waiting?

33:27.089 --> 33:31.009
Wanted to follow up on Bo Jonas.
You heard from him?

33:31.051 --> 33:34.513
Should've called.
Saved you a trip.

33:34.555 --> 33:36.724
Let me help you with the door.

33:36.765 --> 33:40.310
You know what?
I should take this home.

33:40.352 --> 33:43.188
Perishables. I don't know
what I was thinking.

33:48.986 --> 33:50.779
We have a witness
who ID'd Jonas.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.781
-Oh.
-Thank you.

33:52.823 --> 33:55.367
Near the scene,
when Gary was shot.

33:57.077 --> 34:00.289
You think Bo was involved?

34:00.330 --> 34:04.084
I think he's in hiding.
I think he's scared.

34:04.126 --> 34:06.545
Think someone's helping him.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.967
If I do hear anything...

34:12.009 --> 34:15.888
Appreciate it.
All these for you?

34:15.929 --> 34:18.015
No, no, no, no. Sunday.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.975
We encourage fellowship
after service.

34:20.017 --> 34:23.604
Hungry for the Word,
stick around for the doughnuts.

34:23.645 --> 34:25.689
(chuckles)
Something like that.

34:28.233 --> 34:31.653
I'll try to keep my ear low
to the ground, brother Edgar.

34:33.113 --> 34:35.616
You have my number.

34:35.657 --> 34:38.368
That I do.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.714
(sighs)

34:53.759 --> 34:56.220
PIERCE: You really think
we'd drive all the way up here

34:56.261 --> 34:58.263
if we couldn't put
a case on you?

35:01.308 --> 35:04.269
Same build as you. Left-handed.

35:06.188 --> 35:08.190
HART:
Lot of southpaws around.

35:08.232 --> 35:10.484
We're trending.

35:10.526 --> 35:15.197
He speaks.

35:15.239 --> 35:18.951
After popping Esquivel,
Lefty here and his partner

35:18.992 --> 35:21.870
carjacked a man in a parking
garage in East Hollywood.

35:21.912 --> 35:24.998
Killed him, dumped the car
and the body in South L.A.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.292
Sad story.

35:29.169 --> 35:32.422
Someone saw them walk away
from the Buick.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.508
Gave us a good description.

35:37.469 --> 35:38.846
Who's that supposed to be?

35:38.887 --> 35:40.472
You tell us.

35:40.514 --> 35:42.015
No idea.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.521
How about him?

35:47.563 --> 35:50.399
The fuck if I know.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.317
Eyewitness says it's you.

35:52.359 --> 35:55.487
Showed him a six-pack,
he picked you.

35:57.239 --> 35:58.657
He's wrong.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.000
Do-rag?

36:08.041 --> 36:10.210
Ski mask Lefty wore.

36:10.252 --> 36:13.088
Dropped it in the alley
behind the pharmacy.

36:20.137 --> 36:21.305
So?

36:21.346 --> 36:23.056
Your DNA's all over it.

36:26.560 --> 36:30.439
Not just a gun rap now, Hart.
Double homicide.

36:39.031 --> 36:40.449
Your turn to talk.

37:04.431 --> 37:07.184
-Got a minute?
-Sure. What's up?

37:08.518 --> 37:09.853
Scott Anderson did his homework.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.606
Mm-hmm. Down to the
granular details.

37:12.648 --> 37:16.860
"DNA analysis of an untested
piece of evidence.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.487
Skin cell match."

37:18.528 --> 37:21.323
How does he know
about the skin cells?

37:21.365 --> 37:23.158
-Obviously has a source.
-Obviously.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.493
Who?

37:24.534 --> 37:26.286
Cronyn.

37:26.328 --> 37:29.373
What's the upside for Cronyn?
Provoking Harry Bosch

37:29.414 --> 37:31.959
before his client is exonerated?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.418
Well, then who?

37:35.128 --> 37:38.632
Maybe this is a conversation you
should have with my supervisor.

37:38.674 --> 37:39.883
We're just talking.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.802
Don't scratch for it
like a dog, Alex.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.345
I want to know how
this got in the paper.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.055
Wasn't me.

37:45.097 --> 37:47.307
(sighs)

37:47.349 --> 37:48.934
I had to ask.

37:48.976 --> 37:50.060
I know you've been digging

37:50.102 --> 37:51.311
into how that pendant
wound up at Borders'.

37:51.353 --> 37:52.312
Doing my due diligence.

37:52.354 --> 37:53.689
And I admire your tenacity.

37:53.730 --> 37:56.441
I just want to make sure our
work here has been by the book.

37:56.483 --> 37:59.027
Not motivated by personal
animus or history.

37:59.069 --> 38:01.321
You've got nothing
to worry about.

38:04.074 --> 38:06.284
Good.

38:14.876 --> 38:16.211
I believe he's got Bo Jonas

38:16.253 --> 38:17.671
stashed in the back
of that church.

38:17.713 --> 38:19.047
Sanctuary.

38:19.089 --> 38:21.008
I do want to know
what Jonas knows.

38:21.049 --> 38:23.552
I could use some spiritual
enlightenment, my brother.

38:23.593 --> 38:27.264
I'll take you up on that,
my brother. Tomorrow?

38:27.305 --> 38:29.307
Raise the devil.

38:34.021 --> 38:36.481
-Let's hope he's home.
-You don't want to bust him?

38:36.523 --> 38:39.860
Not worth the paperwork, but
I want him to think we might.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.787
(laughing):
Reilly!

38:50.829 --> 38:54.499
The fuck are you
doing here, man?

38:54.541 --> 38:57.127
Oh, shit.

38:57.169 --> 38:59.254
Oh, this is critical, man.

38:59.296 --> 39:03.091
Goddamn,
I can't even believe this.

39:03.133 --> 39:05.343
Believe it.

39:05.385 --> 39:06.678
What do you want?

39:06.720 --> 39:08.430
We're looking
for Elizabeth Clayton.

39:08.472 --> 39:10.474
Well, maybe she doesn't want
to be found.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.350
What makes you think
I know where she's at?

39:12.392 --> 39:14.019
Yesterday, someone picked her up
in Tehachapi.

39:14.061 --> 39:16.730
I've never even heard
of that place.

39:16.772 --> 39:18.732
We got video. Your car,

39:18.774 --> 39:21.318
you behind the wheel.

39:21.359 --> 39:24.488
(sighs)
Fuck.

39:36.333 --> 39:37.918
Dr. Rohat.

39:37.959 --> 39:40.796
-Where?
-Van Nuys.

39:40.837 --> 39:43.507
-Pain clinic?
-Yeah.

39:43.548 --> 39:47.010
They call him Chemical Ali,
he's a one-stop shop.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.887
You front her cash?

39:48.929 --> 39:51.098
No.

39:51.139 --> 39:54.309
She don't pay
with cash with him.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.577
(siren wailing in distance)

40:22.087 --> 40:23.255
(buzzer sounds)

40:23.296 --> 40:25.966
ROHAT (over intercom):
We're closed.

40:26.007 --> 40:27.759
Police. Open the door.

40:27.801 --> 40:30.137
ROHAT:
Do you have I.D.?

40:36.518 --> 40:37.686
(door buzzes)

40:43.400 --> 40:46.987
-Uh, wh-what is this about?
-Chemical Ali?

40:47.028 --> 40:48.405
Dr. Rohat, actually.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.198
We're looking
for Elizabeth Clayton.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.784
Uh, I-I don't know anyone
by that name.

40:52.826 --> 40:55.912
-(clattering)
-Hey! Excuse me!

40:55.954 --> 40:59.416
This is a medical facility.
Do I need to call my attorney?

40:59.457 --> 41:00.667
-Hey!
-Go ahead.

41:09.217 --> 41:11.011
Oh, Jesus.

41:13.471 --> 41:14.681
Elizabeth.

41:14.723 --> 41:16.892
(groaning)

41:16.933 --> 41:18.768
-Reilly?
-Remember me?

41:18.810 --> 41:20.145
What did you give her?

41:20.187 --> 41:21.521
I can't discuss patient care
with you.

41:22.564 --> 41:24.191
(screaming)

41:24.232 --> 41:25.233
-Harry!
-How much?

41:25.275 --> 41:27.485
-Huh? How much?!
-I'm her doctor.

41:27.527 --> 41:29.321
She's my patient, she's fine!

41:29.362 --> 41:31.156
-EDGAR: Harry!
-You fuck her?
You fuck her for your fee?

41:31.198 --> 41:34.284
-You piece of shit.
-It's always consensual! Aah!

41:34.326 --> 41:37.204
-Reilly?
-(Rohat grunts)
-Hey, hey.

41:37.245 --> 41:40.248
-Are you here to take me home?
-Yeah, I'm gonna take you home.

41:40.290 --> 41:42.125
-Mm.
-All right.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.600
I got your badge numbers.

41:58.642 --> 42:01.895
Bosch and Edgar. Hollywood.
Looking forward to your call.

42:04.356 --> 42:06.358
(door opens)

42:08.109 --> 42:10.111
(door closes)

42:11.363 --> 42:13.657
(engine starts)

42:28.088 --> 42:30.048
Your ICE guy came through.

42:30.090 --> 42:33.343
The retainer I've paid him
over the years,

42:33.385 --> 42:35.512
I would fucking hope so.

42:35.553 --> 42:39.140
What in the fuck are we
gonna do in Canada?

42:39.182 --> 42:40.600
Freeze our balls off.

42:43.603 --> 42:46.189
Live to fight another day.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.358
(sighs)

42:48.400 --> 42:50.402
That cop's still a problem.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.989
My problem, mostly.

42:54.030 --> 42:56.074
Mm-hmm.

42:56.116 --> 42:57.075
Still.

42:57.117 --> 42:59.911
SHERIFF:
Forget him.

42:59.953 --> 43:02.998
We're this close to exit time.
Why risk it?

43:06.960 --> 43:08.962
(sighs)

43:10.046 --> 43:12.048
(horn blowing in distance)

43:45.332 --> 43:47.334
(car horn honks in distance)

43:50.503 --> 43:52.714
She's in for a hell of a night.

43:52.756 --> 43:55.717
-I better go say goodbye.
-Probably best now.

43:55.759 --> 43:58.386
Before she starts chewing
her fingernails off.

44:23.703 --> 44:24.913
Hey.

44:30.251 --> 44:31.836
This a lockdown place?

44:31.878 --> 44:34.589
Charlie Company.

44:34.631 --> 44:36.633
They help vets.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.676
Gonna help you.

44:40.804 --> 44:42.180
What's your real name?

44:42.222 --> 44:45.809
Bosch. Harry Bosch.

44:45.850 --> 44:48.061
You some kind of narc,
Harry Bosch?

44:51.398 --> 44:53.108
Just want to see you
get straight.

44:55.151 --> 44:57.570
Thanks.

44:58.613 --> 45:00.657
You can go now.

45:07.122 --> 45:10.291
Look, give this a chance.

45:11.543 --> 45:12.961
For Daisy.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.591
Daisy.

45:34.107 --> 45:37.110
-Thanks, brother.
-Tomorrow, huh?

45:53.793 --> 45:55.503
(sighs)

45:58.131 --> 46:00.550
She's got to want
to save herself.
