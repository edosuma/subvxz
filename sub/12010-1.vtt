WEBVTT

00:03.320 --> 00:05.320
of this extraordinary race.

00:05.360 --> 00:07.920
He's trying to overtake him round
the outside

00:07.960 --> 00:09.680
but he can't get through.

00:09.720 --> 00:12.600
It's Scorpus in green, moving up to
third place.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.680
Looks like too little too late,
though, for the reigning champion.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.840
Whatever happens now, you can say to
your grandchildren,

00:18.880 --> 00:20.880
"Yes, I was there!"

00:20.920 --> 00:22.560
What's going on now?

00:22.600 --> 00:25.080
There's a lot of sand.
Some cheering.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.960
There's a guy selling nuts. In the
race, tell me about the race.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.080
Someone in the crowd's gone topless.
Quickly tell me about that.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.920
Some fat bloke.
And back to the race.

00:32.960 --> 00:35.160
Stop squeezing my neck!
Here comes red again...

00:35.200 --> 00:37.800
Shit, I knew it! I knew I shouldn't
have bet on green.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.760
You shouldn't have bet at all.
That's 40 denari down the drain.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.800
You shouldn't gamble our money away
without asking me. Hang on, 40?

00:43.840 --> 00:45.040
I thought you said four?

00:45.080 --> 00:46.960
I said 40, I just said the 'T' very
quietly.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.080
You total twat!
Red's out of it.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.720
He smacked into a wall.
Oh, yes!

00:51.760 --> 00:53.640
That's nasty. He's covered in blood.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.640
That's a shame, but still yes!
Come on, green!

00:56.680 --> 00:59.680
Blue and green are neck-and-neck.
They're round the final bend.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.800
It's well tied. Get your hands out
of my face!

01:01.840 --> 01:03.520
And? And?
Green!

01:03.560 --> 01:05.560
Yes!

01:05.600 --> 01:07.840
I knew it would be green!

01:07.880 --> 01:09.440
No, it's blue.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.280
You idiot! I told you, I told you
not to throw our money away.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.880
No, green. It is green.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.920
Yes!

01:15.960 --> 01:17.640
I'm still really angry with you.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.280
Yes! Yes!
Oi, you three.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.880
Piss off or buy a ticket like
everyone else.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.320
We'll piss off, thanks. We saw it
for nothing, mate,

01:25.360 --> 01:27.360
and we made a packet, so -

01:29.440 --> 01:31.440
You know what you are, don't you?

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:51.000 --> 01:54.720
So that's a cool 100 for me and a
cool 100 for you.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.800
What do I get?
Nothing, Grumio.

01:57.840 --> 01:59.600
You're my slave. Your money is my
money.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.120
So is your money my money?

02:01.160 --> 02:03.960
No, that's still my money.
Essentially, everything's mine.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.080
Come on, you stingy git.
Give me some.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.280
You're only gonna go and spaff it
all on Cynthia.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.560
Er, no, he won't.
I might actually.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.240
There's a swanky new Hispanian
restaurant just opened

02:13.280 --> 02:15.960
that I want to take her to. See?
You've got to let her go, bro.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.800
You're getting nowhere fast.
Or I'm getting somewhere slow.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.040
You've not grappled anybody since we
got to Rome.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.840
You're denying other ladies the
chance to get busy with you.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.360
I think they're fine with that.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.280
None of that. We have got 100 denari
each.

02:28.320 --> 02:30.360
This is our chance to start again.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.400
To become the big men of Rome.

02:32.440 --> 02:37.120
Meaning? Well, I'm going to reinvent
myself as a charioteer.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.320
Oh, wicked. Girls wet themselves for
those guys.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.480
In a good way. I think chariots cost
a bit more than 100 denari, mate.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.400
Who said anything about getting a
chariot? I can't even drive.

02:46.440 --> 02:48.440
How's that gonna work?

02:52.680 --> 02:56.080
Salve, ladies. Stylax, charioteer.

03:11.240 --> 03:13.040
Hey, Metella.
Have a nice weekend?

03:13.080 --> 03:14.560
You want Cynthia, right?

03:14.600 --> 03:17.080
I was trying to make conversation
with you first. Why?

03:17.120 --> 03:18.480
Because it's neighbourly.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.600
Are you actually interested in my
life at all?

03:20.640 --> 03:21.680
Well, no, but -

03:21.720 --> 03:23.920
So just say what you want rather
than waste my time

03:23.960 --> 03:25.640
asking inane questions.
OK, fine.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.000
I'd like to see Cynthia.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.800
There we are. That's better, isn't
it?

03:30.040 --> 03:31.880
Cynthia!
Yeah?

03:31.920 --> 03:34.600
It's Marcus. Shall I tell him you're
out?

03:34.640 --> 03:38.400
Oh, er...

03:38.440 --> 03:40.200
I can hear all this, by the way.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.360
Oh. Er, no, then.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.480
Hey, Marcus.
What's up?

03:44.520 --> 03:47.360
Hey. So I've managed to bag a table
tomorrow night

03:47.400 --> 03:50.000
at this new Hispanian restaurant if
you wanted to join me.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.640
They do patatas bravas.
That's really sweet,

03:52.680 --> 03:54.920
but I'd better not. I've got an
audition coming up

03:54.960 --> 03:56.160
for the part of a sylph.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.600
Right. What's a sylph?

03:57.640 --> 04:00.040
Like a cross between
a nymph and a sprite.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.640
So...
Thin, basically.

04:02.680 --> 04:06.000
I'm only eating cress at the mo'.
Certainly can't have patatas.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.160
Potatoes.
Can't have those either.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.200
Sorry.
OK.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.280
Good luck with the audition -
Oh.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.800
You all right, darling?
Yep.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.840
You ain't gonna jump, are you?

04:22.880 --> 04:26.640
No. Just er, problem neighbours.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.960
Well, er, thanks for the warning.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.640
I'm Marcus. I live in that one.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.560
Well, I'm Amanda and I live in this
one.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.760
You're not free at all tomorrow
night are you, Amanda?

04:39.800 --> 04:42.320
I'm so proud of you, man!

04:42.360 --> 04:45.960
I didn't deceive her or waste months
pretending to be her friend.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.560
I just asked her out, straight up.
And she just said yes?

04:48.600 --> 04:50.760
Indeed she did.
What's wrong with her then?

04:50.800 --> 04:54.240
Nothing. This guy is a hunk. She's
going because she fancies him.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.680
Or because she fancies
a big steak supper.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.800
No, actually, cos it's not that kind
of food.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.960
It's all small dishes designed for
sharing.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.400
You'll struggle with that then,
you stingy bastard.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.200
Oh my Jove. There you go then,
Grumio.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.560
Don't say I never give you anything.

05:07.600 --> 05:11.040
One deni? Thanks a bloody bunch!

05:15.080 --> 05:17.200
You don't even own a chariot.
Well, not yet.

05:17.240 --> 05:20.120
And yet you bought leathers, cuffs,
a cape -

05:20.160 --> 05:21.520
A helmet.
Don't help him.

05:21.560 --> 05:24.520
In case you crash your imaginary
chariot into an imaginary wall?

05:24.560 --> 05:27.600
All I know is that women love men
who live on the edge.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.920
Who laugh in the face of death.
I know, mate.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.080
Hence why they love me.

05:32.120 --> 05:35.400
What? You laugh in the face of death
do you, Aurelius?

05:35.440 --> 05:38.320
I once had sex in a graveyard. So...

05:38.360 --> 05:40.400
Wow.
Yes, thank you. I know.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.400
And did you put the corpse back
afterwards?

05:42.440 --> 05:44.040
No -
Did you just leave it there?

05:44.080 --> 05:47.520
It wasn't with a corpse - Were you
laughing in its face? It was a living woman.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.760
She started off that way...
For the whole time -

05:49.800 --> 05:52.000
Does she still walk?
I would never hump a corpse!

05:52.040 --> 05:56.920
I think I'll be cremated all the
same, water boy, just to be safe.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.960
Yes, good idea.
Water man.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.800
Shredder, have you got yourself a
chariot?

06:01.840 --> 06:04.720
Of course he has. What kind of fool
would buy all the chariot kit

06:04.760 --> 06:06.120
without having a chariot?

06:06.160 --> 06:08.920
I must say, I do like young men in
leather. And in general.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.040
Thank you very much.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.040
My husband collects chariots.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.800
I tell him he's compensating for
shortcomings elsewhere.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.640
Is that what you're doing? No, no
shortcomings here.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.680
Long-comings if anything.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.200
That reminds me, I've left my
lunchbox at home.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.760
Be a love and whizz back and get it
for me. Go to your house?

06:24.800 --> 06:27.520
Won't take long in a chariot.
30-minute round trip.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.960
I might need a bit longer.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.280
Nonsense. Crack the whip! You do
have a whip, don't you?

06:33.320 --> 06:35.080
No, so maybe I shouldn't go.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.120
No, no, no. You can borrow one of
mine.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.160
Follow me.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.320
Don't forget your helmet, mate.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.360
Safety first.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.760
Salve, Grumio.
All right, landlord?

07:06.800 --> 07:08.280
What's with the bling?

07:08.320 --> 07:11.880
Well, you know, business is booming
so I thought I'd treat myself.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.800
What's with the big man?

07:13.840 --> 07:15.840
I thought I'd treat myself to him
too.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.400
I'm accessorising. His name's Davis.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.200
All right, fella.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.600
In fact, take the weight off a sec
will you, Davis?

07:24.120 --> 07:26.120
That's better.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.400
How can I get rich then?

07:28.440 --> 07:30.960
Well, in my experience, the easiest
way to make money

07:31.000 --> 07:33.800
is to have loads already.
Right. Any other ways?

07:33.840 --> 07:36.680
Could work really hard.
Any other ways?

07:36.720 --> 07:39.480
You could try something like Amanda
over there.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.680
What's her story then?

07:42.720 --> 07:45.400
Works from home. World's oldest
profession.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.440
She busy then, is she?

07:47.480 --> 07:49.560
Oh, yeah. Lot of happy customers.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.600
Going in and out.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.640
Know what I mean?

07:56.320 --> 07:58.320
That'll do. Lovely.

08:20.480 --> 08:22.480
Hello?

08:22.520 --> 08:25.080
Yes? What do you want?

08:26.440 --> 08:28.440
Hey.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.799
Hm?

08:32.840 --> 08:35.080
My name's Stylax, I work with Flavia.
Mm-hm?

08:35.120 --> 08:36.280
And what do you want?

08:36.320 --> 08:38.720
I'm here to pick up her lunchbox.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.760
It's there.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.240
Is that it?
Could I have a glass of water?

08:47.280 --> 08:51.600
No.
Eff off, then.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.560
Cool, I'll just -
Yeah. Just go.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.800
He's definitely doing the dirty.
You don't know that.

09:00.840 --> 09:04.760
He was with a woman who was
butt-naked and boobs-naked.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.800
Everything-naked.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.840
Which tunic do you think?
That one.

09:08.880 --> 09:12.040
I caught him with his dick in the
cookie jar

09:12.080 --> 09:14.720
and you know what that means? His
dick's got crumbs on it.

09:14.760 --> 09:16.720
And therefore?
Don't eat his cookies?

09:16.760 --> 09:19.760
We threaten to tell Flavia.
No way.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.320
We're not blackmailing him.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.840
I just want some hush money.
Or a chariot.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.240
I want a hush chariot.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.880
Count me in. It's got sod all to do
with you, Grumio.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.720
Or any of us.
Right, how do I look?

09:30.760 --> 09:34.640
You're an absolute dreamboat, mate.
If I were a girl, I'd ruin you.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.080
That's a bit weird, but thanks.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.840
Now remember, you are a big man of
Rome

09:38.880 --> 09:42.120
so splash the cash, spread the love
and show the girl a good time.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.560
So, so proud.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.480
Wow. This is dead posh, innit?

09:59.520 --> 10:01.520
The forks are metal and everything.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.920
Yes, well, order anything else you
want. It's all on me.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.160
So have you got a good job then,
Marcus?

10:07.200 --> 10:11.120
Er, sort of. I work for Rome's third
largest grain supply company.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.400
Oh, wow. I bet you like grain then.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.600
I don't actually work with the grain
myself. I'm a copier.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.240
Try the patatas.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.760
I do know a thing or two about
grain. I grew up on a farm.

10:20.800 --> 10:25.080
Oh, wow. Do you know, I love farms.
All the little ducks and everything.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.000
I bet that was brilliant.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.880
Yeah, it had its moments.
Oh, yeah?

10:28.920 --> 10:30.920
What sort of moments?

10:30.960 --> 10:35.360
Er, let's think. Erm, one time I was
in a chicken coup

10:35.400 --> 10:37.320
and I found a square egg.
Square?

10:37.360 --> 10:41.080
Really? That's dead odd, innit?
Cos eggs are usually sort of round.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.320
Egg-shaped, yeah, I know. But this
was more...

10:43.360 --> 10:45.520
it wasn't a perfect square,
it was still an egg.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.000
But put it this way, it's on my
parent's mantelpiece

10:48.040 --> 10:50.560
and it's not rolling anywhere.
Have some more wine.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.680
OK.
Oh, don't worry about it.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.280
No, no.
Waiter.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.320
One more bottle of wine, please.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.360
Yes, sir. House again?

10:59.400 --> 11:01.240
Erm, no, actually.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.040
I think this time we'll go one up
from house.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.680
Salve, ladies. Stylax, charioteer.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.280
They could tell, can't they?

11:22.320 --> 11:24.240
Tell what? That I'm not
a real charioteer.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.560
I'm just a twat in a uniform.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.720
Hang on.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.880
I wish we had more money.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.320
Well, that didn't work, did it?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Oh, Marcus. That is amazing.

11:49.040 --> 11:52.560
Shall I keep going?
Up to you, babes.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.800
Do whatever you want.
I'll keep going.

11:58.240 --> 12:01.080
Just a mo'.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.520
- I'll be five minutes, yeah?
- OK, no worries.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.080
I'm sorry, babes. It's your five
minute warning.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.320
Why, who was that?

12:09.360 --> 12:11.360
My next client. Just a bit early.

12:11.400 --> 12:15.720
"Client"? Sorry, Amanda, are you a -

12:15.760 --> 12:18.400
I'm not being rude - but are you a -
Er, yeah.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.440
Ah.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.120
How long were you down there for?

12:34.160 --> 12:36.160
Maybe... an hour?

12:36.200 --> 12:39.000
An hour? I can't believe I was so
stupid.

12:39.040 --> 12:42.080
She laughed at my jokes. She even
liked the square egg story.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.920
That's basically a prostitute test.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.480
I like that story. This is all your
fault, you realise?

12:46.520 --> 12:49.160
How do you work that out? I was
trying to spread the love.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.320
Show her a good time. And look where
that got me.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.960
100 denari bill and lockjaw.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.600
For that sort of money you really
should have humped her.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.640
I just warmed her up for the next
guy. Or guys.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.720
I probably wasn't even her first of
the day.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.760
No, you weren't.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.480
How do you know?
Cos I saw her with a fat bloke.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.520
Right. And why didn't you tell me?

13:07.560 --> 13:09.920
Landlord said she did the oldest job
in the world.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.160
That's a prostitute.
Famously a prostitute.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.640
Right. I thought it were a cook.

13:14.680 --> 13:16.440
A cook? Why would it be a cook?

13:16.480 --> 13:18.680
Even a prozzie's got to eat,
hasn't she?

13:18.720 --> 13:21.240
He makes a fair point. You should
have given me the money.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.480
It wouldn't have ended up like this.
Oh, really?

13:23.520 --> 13:26.360
It wouldn't have ended with me
sucking you off? Good to know!

13:26.400 --> 13:28.840
Hi, guys.
Hey, Cynthia. Hello, hello.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.720
How was the audition?
Hideous.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.400
I was so weak from the cress diet

13:32.440 --> 13:34.320
that I passed out walking up the
stairs.

13:34.360 --> 13:37.560
Oh, shit. I know. On the flipside,
I'm now hardcore comfort eating.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.440
So if you still want to go to that
restaurant, then I'm game.

13:40.480 --> 13:44.200
Yeah. I'm a bit broke is all.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.120
My treat. Just got Nana's
inheritance fund.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.680
Oh, great. And condolences,
obviously.

13:49.720 --> 13:53.920
Also, I don't know if you've noticed but landlord's
moved a filthy whore into the building.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.680
We just found out ourselves.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.920
So I've started a petition to have
her evicted

13:57.960 --> 14:00.680
before the whole building's crawling
with horny creeps.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.640
Do you know what I mean?
Completely, yeah.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.680
So you'll sign it, right?

14:04.720 --> 14:07.800
I...of course.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.600
I just came round to say thank you
for a lovely evening

14:16.640 --> 14:19.680
and to see if there's any way I
could get away with not paying for it.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.560
Why?
I didn't know that you were a...

14:22.600 --> 14:25.240
He didn't have a clue.
Did you not spot the red candle?

14:25.280 --> 14:27.800
See, I grew up on a farm where we
didn't have the whole

14:27.840 --> 14:30.760
red candle system. What about how
flirty I was with you?

14:30.800 --> 14:32.600
I genuinely thought you were into
me.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.640
And when I checked your dick for
lice?

14:34.680 --> 14:37.040
Yeah, in hindsight that was a bit
odd.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.560
Even so, the fact is you got taken
to a fancy restaurant

14:39.600 --> 14:42.480
where you ate two desserts
and then received oral attention.

14:42.520 --> 14:43.920
For an hour.
Approx.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.720
If anything, you should be paying
him.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.400
That won't be necessary, but maybe
we could call it quits?

14:48.440 --> 14:50.880
What you choose to do in our time is
entirely up to you.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.720
You didn't find it weird that I
chose to do that? For an hour?

14:53.760 --> 14:56.080
He's got lockjaw, for Jove's sake!

14:56.120 --> 14:58.320
OK, mate. Could we at least arrange
a discount?

14:58.360 --> 15:01.240
I'll give you a 20% discount, only
because you're a dopey twat.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.200
Thank you, that's kind of you. But I
will need it for today. Fine.

15:04.240 --> 15:07.160
Well, if you'll excuse me, I need my
beauty sleep.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.200
I am chockablock later.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.000
Sorry, erm, have you got a menu I
could take away?

15:13.040 --> 15:15.040
Is it called a menu?

15:19.200 --> 15:20.840
So what are we going to say to him?

15:20.880 --> 15:23.360
"Game's up, sucker! We know you're
doing the dirty."

15:23.400 --> 15:27.200
We're not calling him "sucker."
We need to set the tone, show him we
mean business.

15:27.240 --> 15:30.240
People who mean business don't say
"sucker." How about "nonce"?

15:30.280 --> 15:31.920
Doesn't "nonce" mean paedophile?

15:31.960 --> 15:33.960
"Shut your mush, you fucking mush."

15:34.000 --> 15:36.800
Forget about that. What are our
demands gonna be?

15:36.840 --> 15:39.440
I need 80 denari.
Round that up to a cool grand.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.600
That's more than rounding up.
Plus a chariot.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.040
And a horse.
Good thinking.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.160
Some feed for the horse.
Er, yeah.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.280
Some feed for me.
Why do you need feed?

15:47.320 --> 15:49.120
Cos I'm hungry.
Some feed for G-man.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.760
Or "food" as we tend to call it.

15:50.800 --> 15:54.200
A cool grand, chariot, a horse, some
feed and some food.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.200
OK.
Let's do this.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.840
Shut your fucking mush,
you bozo bitch sucker.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.320
You all right?
Yeah.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.040
I was here yesterday for the
lunchbox. I know.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.760
And? And when I was here I saw
something.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.520
Something big. And bad.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.200
Get to the point maybe?

16:17.240 --> 16:19.240
Your dick's got crumbs on it.
What?

16:19.280 --> 16:22.200
I saw her. The naked lady frolicking
about, I saw her.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.280
Oh, right. Now we're getting
somewhere.

16:24.320 --> 16:27.520
And you thought you'd come back with
your two heavies, did you,

16:27.560 --> 16:28.920
to blackmail me?

16:28.960 --> 16:30.840
And if you don't want us to tell
Flavia,

16:30.880 --> 16:34.240
you'd better meet our demands.
Flavia, darling, love of my life.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.400
Come down here for a moment will
you, please?

16:36.440 --> 16:38.440
There's some idiots at the door.

16:38.480 --> 16:41.640
When do we get to do our demands?
I'm not sure we do.

16:41.680 --> 16:44.440
Ah, yes. These are my idiots.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.080
And my idiots' idiot.

16:46.120 --> 16:49.920
It's all getting very exciting down here,
darling. They're trying to blackmail me.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.080
No, he said blackmail. I didn't say -

16:52.120 --> 16:54.800
They're threatening to tell you
about the naked lady

16:54.840 --> 16:57.640
that was here yesterday.
Oh, bless.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.840
Do you want to handle this or should
I go and get my big sword?

17:00.880 --> 17:03.200
No, no, no. Leave it with me,
Cornelius, my love.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.240
Light of my world.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.359
Forgive my husband for being
brusque, boys,

17:10.400 --> 17:14.119
he's just a very talented artist
and therefore a very rude person.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.079
Currently he's working on a
sculpture on the birth of Venus.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.119
The nude was his model.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.560
Oh, right. You sure?

17:20.599 --> 17:23.160
I hardly think Venus would be
clothed at birth, would she?

17:23.200 --> 17:25.400
I mean, were you born clothed?

17:25.440 --> 17:26.839
No.
Can't remember.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.040
I'm sorry. We needed money.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.000
I see. Well, since you're here,
Shredder,

17:31.040 --> 17:33.840
why don't you chauffeur me into
town? I'll give you ten denari.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.200
I don't actually own a chariot,
turns out.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.240
Just got the uniform.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.400
Well, do please come again soon.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.440
Can we carry you for ten denari?

17:42.480 --> 17:44.880
Or five? We're desperate. Is there
anything we can do?

17:44.920 --> 17:47.480
Well, maybe rob a bank?

17:51.720 --> 17:54.000
Ey up, I've got an idea.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.040
Is it robbing a bank?

17:56.080 --> 17:58.080
Not quite.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.200
Come on, get stuck in.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.720
I think this is illegal.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.520
Nobody owns this money. They've
literally thrown it away.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.240
So they'd have their wishes granted.
It works, don't it?

18:09.280 --> 18:11.720
Last night I wished we had more
money and today we do.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.680
It's a miracle, praise the Gods!

18:13.720 --> 18:15.800
Bloody hell, five denari.

18:15.840 --> 18:18.120
Nice one. Next time I'm bringing a
bucket.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.760
Are we big men now? Cos I don't feel
like a big man.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.040
Did you just splash me?
Sorry.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.680
Fountains make me want to do
splashy-splashy.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.560
Grumio, do not splash him back.
I order you.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.920
If he's gonna do splashy-splashy,
then so am I.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.400
Oi, stop a sec. No, you're only
gonna splashy-splashy me!

18:46.440 --> 18:48.440
Seriously...
Oi!

18:48.480 --> 18:51.160
Shit, maybe it is illegal.
Stay where you are.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.200
Oi!

19:29.440 --> 19:32.560
Psst.
Spare any change?

19:38.640 --> 19:40.680
You're turning this place into a den
of sin.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.960
You should have checked
with the tenants first.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.360
She's not hurting anyone.
Unless they pay her to.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.960
What if one of your dirty clients

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
accidentally knocks on my door in
the night?

19:49.040 --> 19:50.800
Take him in, darling. You could do
well.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.320
Thank you very much, but that's not
really the point.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.640
Especially if you remove that pole
from your arse.

19:55.680 --> 19:58.200
Right, that is it. Landlord, you
have to get rid of her.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.640
I'm not alone here. I've started a
petition amongst the other tenants.

20:01.680 --> 20:04.040
You what? I've already
got several supporters.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.080
Marcus! You'll back me up.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.920
I was just going to get changed.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.800
This is important.
For when we go out.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.360
"The following tenants demand the
eviction

20:12.400 --> 20:14.080
of the whore from flat six."

20:14.120 --> 20:15.760
Did you sign it?

20:15.800 --> 20:17.760
Did I? I can't remember...

20:17.800 --> 20:19.480
"Marcus Goer." Yep, you did, yeah.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.520
You can bloody forget the discount
now then.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.840
Discount? What discount?

20:22.880 --> 20:24.880
Uh-huh, this is interesting.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.440
There was a misunderstanding.
I want the full 100, now.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.880
You paid for sex?
No, he hasn't paid yet.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.560
I didn't actually have sex with her.
What did you do, then?

20:33.880 --> 20:36.720
Doesn't matter. Erm... sorry, it's a
bit wet.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.800
You're paying me in damp change.
Are you serious?

20:39.840 --> 20:44.680
Still legal tender.
8, 10, 17, 20, 24...

20:44.720 --> 20:47.640
I'm a bit short. Could I owe you?
No, you couldn't.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.240
Right. Erm...

20:50.280 --> 20:54.480
Cynthia, any chance I could borrow
some - What?

20:54.520 --> 20:57.080
You want me to fund
your prostitute habit?

20:57.120 --> 20:58.680
It's not a habit, it was a one-off.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.800
And a mistake. I thought it might be
pleasure rather than business.

21:01.840 --> 21:05.440
You thought someone would go out with
you for pleasure? Don't start. How much?

21:05.480 --> 21:07.560
76 denari.
I'm really sorry.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.720
This is not what Nana's inheritance
is for.

21:11.960 --> 21:15.400
Here's 80. You can keep the change.
It was a pleasure doing business with you.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.640
Thank you. I'll pay you back.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.040
And tonight, are we still on for
dinner?

21:21.080 --> 21:24.720
You expect me to pay your prostitute
bills and then buy you dinner?

21:24.760 --> 21:26.760
Well, ideally...

21:26.800 --> 21:28.800
Wow.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.720
Legend.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.880
I don't need a chariot.
Don't need it.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.800
I'll stick to walking.
I like walking.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.840
You're good at walking. Plus there's
running costs, the parking.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.880
One-way system's a nightmare.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.840
They are as sexy as hell,
though.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.880
You're not wrong.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.360
This one's just like the one outside
Flavia's -

22:04.720 --> 22:11.080
Uh-oh! I've got you now, you dirty
little punk-arsed pussy sucker.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.120
Bloody nonce.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.600
Oh, shit.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.240
Take the next left.
Don't know how.
