They can't punish us.

00:03.700 --> 00:05.588
- It's not a punishment.
- Really?

00:05.630 --> 00:07.359
Being disinvited
to your own prom?

00:07.400 --> 00:08.765
You can still celebrate
that night

00:08.800 --> 00:10.802
in a quiet, more intimate way.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.705
(Ella)
Veronica's offered _
to host a small gathering

00:12.740 --> 00:14.207

(Spencer)
Alison went to prom.

00:15.340 --> 00:16.739
She's hoping to meet Charles.

00:16.780 --> 00:18.668
Sara? I can't believe
you'd leave your prom..

00:18.710 --> 00:21.247
This is where I felt
I should be. With you.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.612
Our recipients are ultimately
chosen by my employer.

00:23.650 --> 00:25.447
Would that be Mr. Carissimi?

00:25.490 --> 00:27.082
(Hanna)
That guy was definitely
hiding something.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.451
Yeah, you think?

00:28.490 --> 00:30.424
Okay, you couldn't pick that
even if you tried.

00:37.570 --> 00:40.164
Emily, this is Ali's phone.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.565
- Give her a little kiss.
- 'Is that you, Charles?‘

00:41.600 --> 00:43.136
I know who A is.

00:43.170 --> 00:44.398
His name is Charles DiLaurentis

00:44.440 --> 00:45.429
and he's my brother.

00:45.470 --> 00:46.607

We may have a visual
of the suspect on the roof.

to help you.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.613
Don't do this to your sister.

01:33.660 --> 01:36.481
You spent your whole life trying
to get back to your family.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.327
It's not too late.

01:40.500 --> 01:44.220
You've been such a bitch to us,

Ali could be on the roof.
Did anybody check the roof?

02:38.490 --> 02:40.253
Guys, we promised Toby
that we would stay here

02:40.290 --> 02:41.257
until he escorted

02:41.290 --> 02:42.427
us out, remember?

02:43.690 --> 02:45.681
The guys are talking
to Clark and Tanner.

02:45.730 --> 02:48.255
She's got a lot of questions,
for all of us.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.767
Okay, well, how long
do we have to stay here?

02:49.800 --> 02:51.324
We could be out there
looking for her.

02:51.370 --> 02:52.962
Em, look,
we have to believe

02:53.000 --> 02:55.298
that Charles i_sn't
gonna hurt Alison.

God, Mona, you scared
the crap out of us.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.454
I've been following Alison
since yesterday morning.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.297
I lost her when you guys
jumped the cop.

03:56.330 --> 03:57.763
You knew that Clark was a cop?

03:57.800 --> 03:59.290
Aria, maybe you thought
he was always happy

03:59.340 --> 04:00.568
to see you,
but I could never get past

04:00.600 --> 04:01.692
the bulge in his pants.

[cell phone chimes]

04:04.770 --> 04:05.930
What is that?

04:05.970 --> 04:07.335
I started snarfing Alison

04:07.380 --> 04:08.699
ever since she
came back to town.

04:08.740 --> 04:11.800
Yesterday, she started
getting texts. From Charles.

04:11.850 --> 04:12.919
I couldn't get a lock
on where he was

04:12.950 --> 04:14.440
so I coded
a program to decrypt

04:14.480 --> 04:15.742
'the signal source and..'

04:15.780 --> 04:17.486
What is it?

04:17.520 --> 04:20.011
- Mona.
- I-it took a while, but..

04:20.060 --> 04:22.620
Okay, Mona, just finish
the sentence! Please.

04:22.660 --> 04:23.820
(Spencer)
What is it?

04:23.860 --> 04:25.680
Charles has his own
cellular network

04:25.730 --> 04:27.322
'and the servers
are located at..'

04:27.360 --> 04:28.691
The Carissimi Group.

04:28.730 --> 04:30.618
I knew it. Rhys is Charles.

04:31.770 --> 04:33.032
(Aria)
Em, where are you going?

04:33.070 --> 04:34.833
- I'm going to get Ali.
- I'm calling Tanner.

04:34.870 --> 04:37.668
Fine, but I'm not waiting around
to answer a million questions.

05:41.900 --> 05:44.733
Why are the cops here?

05:44.770 --> 05:46.931
Wait, you don't think
that's Ali's chopped-up body

05:46.980 --> 05:48.800
in those bags, is it?

05:48.840 --> 05:50.046
- Hanna.
- What?

05:50.080 --> 05:51.399
Isn't that what
we we're all thinking?

05:56.790 --> 05:58.417
What is in those bags?

05:58.450 --> 06:00.589
And why are they moving them
in the middle of the night?

Do you seriously think
we can outsmart A?

06:22.140 --> 06:25.576
Uh, try Mrs. D.'s, 12-18.

06:25.610 --> 06:26.941
(Hanna)
Wait, you know
Mrs. D.'s birthday?

06:26.980 --> 06:29.141
I'm a self-taught eidetiker.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.148
That's not a learned skill.
It's a phenomenon.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.813
Yeah, what is it?

06:33.860 --> 06:36.078
Five days after he took me
to the bunker

06:36.120 --> 06:38.657
Charles gave me a red,
white and blue cupcake.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.499
But it wasn't
Fourth of July.

06:40.530 --> 06:43.124
I kept track
of every day I was there.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.968
And every year, he gave me
a cupcake on September 7th.

06:49.070 --> 06:51.766
[beeping]

06:53.840 --> 06:56.673
See? We are smarter
than Charles.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.550
It's just a stupid room.

07:08.590 --> 07:10.421
Yeah, but A's not stupid.

07:17.130 --> 07:19.690
[dramatic music]

07:27.080 --> 07:29.469
Did we just walk
inside A's brain?

07:30.680 --> 07:33.513
Yeah, Hanna.
I think we did.

07:34.820 --> 07:36.742
I think he knows we're here.

07:39.920 --> 07:43.219
Sara? You okay?

07:43.260 --> 07:45.080
I'm gonna wait out here.

07:45.130 --> 07:46.893
It's a little tight in there.

How could you do this to me?

09:20.790 --> 09:22.212
I risked everything to help you.

09:22.260 --> 09:25.354
You gave me a passport
and a plane ticket.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.119
I'd hardly call that everything.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.025
It was all that I had.

09:29.060 --> 09:31.665
If you keep making
this about you, All

09:31.700 --> 09:32.928
it's gonna be a long night

09:32.970 --> 09:34.062
and we don't have much time.

and my srster **

09:52.220 --> 09:54.711
Does she think we came
between her and Ali?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.284
Is that what this
has all been about?

09:56.320 --> 09:59.084
Wait, so CeCe is Charles?

09:59.130 --> 10:00.688
Sh-she is a she, right?

(Aria)
'Wait, shouldn't the cops
be here by now?‘

10:04.130 --> 10:06.121
They're not coming.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.139
How do you think CeCe
escaped police custody?

10:09.170 --> 10:11.138
Sara called Tanner
directly, right?

10:11.170 --> 10:14.731
What, wait, you think
Tanner is working for CeCe?

10:14.780 --> 10:17.669
Yeah, and I bet she told Sara
that we're all just fine.

10:19.150 --> 10:21.675
- Tanner does wear_ nice shoes.
- Guys, qUIet.

mom brought you home..'

12:19.570 --> 12:21.868
We're doing the right thing.

12:21.900 --> 12:24.460
We can't risk him harming
Jason or the baby.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.232
I never meant to hurt you.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.145
But that's all dad needed
to get rid of me.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.216
But it was an accident.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.774
He had to have known that.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.219
Oh, I'm sure he did.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.548
I don't understand.

12:38.590 --> 12:41.115
For as long as I can remember..

12:41.160 --> 12:43.082
...I asked mom
to buy me dresses.

12:45.090 --> 12:46.523
But he wouldn't let her

12:46.560 --> 12:49.324
so I'd just play dress up
in her closet.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.294
She thought it was cute.

12:52.570 --> 12:55.539
But dad found out...and..

13:03.310 --> 13:06.177
They can hear us.
They just can't move.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.483
You never visited me.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.882
Not even once.

13:18.460 --> 13:20.018
Thank God neither of us

13:20.060 --> 13:22.995
inherited the bastard's
beady eyes.

13:23.030 --> 13:25.089
(Mona)
That's what CeCe did to me.

13:25.130 --> 13:26.893
My brain kept telling me
to scream

13:26.940 --> 13:29.295
but my-my body couldn't move.

13:29.340 --> 13:31.228
Jason and _Mr. D.
are IIVIng a nightmare

13:31.270 --> 13:32.999
they can't wake up from.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.235
Oh, my God, Jason.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.043
I feel sorry for Jason,
but I don't think

13:37.080 --> 13:39.139
I could ever
feel bad for Mr. D.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.249
(both)
Same.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.815
Mom came to visit me
as often as she could.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.511
'Aunt Carol came
a couple of times.'

13:50.160 --> 13:54.620
But...for the next
seven years at Radley..

13:54.660 --> 13:56.594
...I was almost
completely alone.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.060
That must have been awful.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.499
You think?

14:03.440 --> 14:06.238
When I turned twelve”

14:06.270 --> 14:09.398
...mom bought me this beautiful
yellow dress for Christmas.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.945
'And after that, every time
she would buy you clothes..'

14:14.980 --> 14:17.619
...she would buy me
the same outfit.

14:20.020 --> 14:22.113
Almost like we were twins.

14:26.190 --> 14:28.090
[chuckles]

14:28.130 --> 14:29.392
You're beautiful.

14:32.170 --> 14:34.434
Absolutely stunning.

14:36.370 --> 14:38.463
Thanks, Bethany.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.410
Wish we could find
a way out of here.

14:47.450 --> 14:49.475
Leaving's easy, Charles.

14:51.490 --> 14:54.254
It's staying gone
that would be tough.

14:54.290 --> 14:55.416
My mom always says

14:55.460 --> 14:57.052
that nothing's
more believable

14:57.090 --> 14:59.024
than a really good lie.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.449
We just need to come up
with a great story.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.127
Something fabulous

15:03.170 --> 15:05.491
and devastating
at the same time.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.565
Like..

15:07.570 --> 15:09.094
...we got lost in the woods

15:09.140 --> 15:11.199
and we were raised
by a pack of wolves.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.003
Amateur.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.270
Does it look like I
could survive in the woods?

15:16.380 --> 15:18.348
You're too pretty for that.

15:19.410 --> 15:20.718
Our parents were crackheads.

15:20.750 --> 15:23.639
They sold us for a fix.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.682
Please don't make me
talk about it anymore.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.517
It's too painful.

15:29.420 --> 15:32.480
Wow. You're good.

15:32.530 --> 15:34.157
[door opens]

15:34.200 --> 15:36.657
'Oh, it's that goody two-shoes,
Mrs. Cavanaugh.‘

15:36.700 --> 15:39.589
She can't see me like this.
You have to help me.

15:39.630 --> 15:41.268
Of course.

15:47.210 --> 15:48.472
[dramatic music]

15:48.510 --> 15:51.445
[indistinct chatter]

15:56.650 --> 15:58.083
[Mrs. Cavanaugh screaming]

16:03.660 --> 16:05.719
Oh, my God!

16:07.460 --> 16:09.223
Bethany, what did you do?

16:09.260 --> 16:11.262
What did I do?

16:11.300 --> 16:14.292
You pushed her...freak.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.535
[dramatic music]

16:19.210 --> 16:22.236
So...Bethany blamed you

16:22.280 --> 16:23.679
for Mrs. Cavanaugh's death?

16:23.710 --> 16:27.077
No one believed the boy
wearing the dress.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.248
I had the most to lose,
so they thought I pushed her.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.314
Even mom?

16:31.350 --> 16:32.715
She paid off Wilden

16:32.750 --> 16:34.308
to make sure Marion's death

16:34.360 --> 16:35.657
was ruled a suicide.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.555
Oh, my God.

16:37.590 --> 16:40.388
He let Toby think
his mother killed herself.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.493
All this time, he thought
she chose to leave him.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.160
That changed him.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.099
Mrs. D. sacrificed
Toby for Charles.

16:53.140 --> 16:56.234
Now we know who taught A
how to treat people like dolls.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.679
Mr. D. abandoned him

16:57.710 --> 17:00.110
but Mrs. D. taught
Charles how to be A.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.618
After that..

17:02.650 --> 17:05.539
...the doctors gave me
a new diagnosis.

17:05.590 --> 17:08.479
Intermittent explosive disorder.

17:09.690 --> 17:11.180
Why is that funny?

17:11.230 --> 17:14.097
'Cause it _was _
an accurate diagn05|s..

17:15.830 --> 17:18.025
...for that
crazy bitch, Bethany.

17:19.630 --> 17:22.667
The next couple of years,
they doped me up on tranqs

17:22.700 --> 17:25.601
till I almost drowned
In my own drool.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.301
Literally.

17:27.340 --> 17:28.773
I'm so sorry.

17:28.810 --> 17:30.846
Wait. Now Ali's apologizing?

17:30.880 --> 17:33.519
I mean, is she forgetting
the hell that A put us through?

17:33.550 --> 17:36.178
- All of us, including her?
- Shh!

17:36.220 --> 17:38.814
I think the quacks felt bad
for almost killing me

17:38.850 --> 17:41.057
so they let me out
for a funeral.

17:41.720 --> 17:42.709
Who died?

17:45.190 --> 17:47.351
[instrumental music]

17:48.500 --> 17:50.058
(CeCe)
'Charles.‘

17:52.730 --> 17:55.528
We buried him...at Aunt Carol's.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.607
And then mom finally
accepted me as her daughter..

18:00.640 --> 18:03.438
...and I thought I was
gonna get to go home..

18:03.480 --> 18:05.778
...but she took me
back to Radley..

18:05.810 --> 18:07.812
...as Charlotte.

18:07.850 --> 18:09.841
Wait, so Charles is CeCe

18:09.880 --> 18:12.440
but CeCe is Charlotte?

18:13.690 --> 18:14.714
[beeping]

18:14.760 --> 18:15.886
(Hanna)
'What is that?‘

18:15.920 --> 18:18.252
(Mona)
It's a motion sensor.

18:18.290 --> 18:21.123
[beeping]

18:25.630 --> 18:27.689
- What is it?
- It's Radley.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.799
The rear west wing.
It's on the second floor.

18:34.910 --> 18:37.606
[dramatic music]

18:37.650 --> 18:39.675
There's another one?

18:40.680 --> 18:41.840
I thought Ali and CeCe

18:41.880 --> 18:43.745
were the only two Red Coats.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.280
So who's that?

18:45.320 --> 18:46.844
What is she doing
with those trash cans?

18:48.290 --> 18:49.848
(Spencer)
'That's not trash.‘

18:50.730 --> 18:52.755
Oh, my God.

18:52.790 --> 18:54.291
That's why she's
telling us her story

18:54.330 --> 18:56.321
that's how she's gonna end it.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.294
CeCe's gonna blow up Radley.

18:59.870 --> 19:02.361
I couldn't trust
anyone after Bethany.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.429
So I found a way

19:04.470 --> 19:05.835
to escape Radley..

19:06.910 --> 19:08.832
...without ever leaving.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.411
Knock, knock.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.748
Mom.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.287
[chuckles]

19:19.320 --> 19:21.914
Oh, I have some fantastic news.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.655
They're letting me out?

19:23.690 --> 19:25.328
Well, sort of.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.667
Either I'm locked in here,
or I'm not.

19:32.370 --> 19:34.736
There's no sort of
being a patient at Radley.

19:34.770 --> 19:36.897
The board has granted
you permission

19:36.940 --> 19:38.805
to attend classes at UPenn.

19:39.940 --> 19:41.601
How did you do that? How..

19:41.640 --> 19:43.540
You did it, Charlotte

19:43.580 --> 19:45.605
by showing them
how smart you are.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.480
Now, now, don't cry.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.613
I'm very proud of you.

19:55.590 --> 19:57.649
I thought going to school
would be fun

19:57.690 --> 20:00.250
but I already knew
most of what they were teaching.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.229
One day,
classes were cancelled..

20:04.300 --> 20:05.790
Okay, I called in a bomb threat.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.298
I knew it was a risk..

20:08.340 --> 20:09.864
...but I needed
to see my family.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.004
[camera shutter clicks]

20:12.040 --> 20:14.270
(Charlotte)
'Would it kill you to smile?‘

20:14.310 --> 20:15.470
What's it to you?

20:15.510 --> 20:17.239
Rude much?

20:20.450 --> 20:21.872
Sorry, I, uh..

20:21.920 --> 20:24.286
What?

20:24.320 --> 20:25.685
Can we start again?

20:25.720 --> 20:28.814
Um, I'm Jason.
Jason DiLaurentis.

20:30.590 --> 20:31.818
(female #1)
'Next, please.‘

20:32.930 --> 20:35.524
Do you even
go to school here?

20:35.560 --> 20:37.528
No.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.788
But I bet I'll be the prettiest
girl in the yearbook.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.866
You didn't tell me your name.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.868
You're right. I didn't.

20:45.910 --> 20:47.673
I'm CeCe.

20:47.710 --> 20:48.802
[camera shutter clicks]

20:48.840 --> 20:50.341
CeCe Drake.

20:51.910 --> 20:53.275
I know what you're gonna say.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.719
It's screwed up
that I dated my brother.

20:54.750 --> 20:57.639
- Did you guys..
- Okay, that's just sick, Ali.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.454
Like I said,
it's my brother.

21:00.490 --> 21:02.754
Why do you think he was
so mad all the time?

21:02.790 --> 21:05.054
He was so frustrated.

21:05.090 --> 21:07.024
And who could blame him?

21:08.800 --> 21:10.927
I mean, look at me.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.808
(Alison)
'I can't believe
mom was okay with this.'

21:21.710 --> 21:23.678
Mom didn't know
CeCe was Charlotte

21:23.710 --> 21:25.473
until the day
we left for Cape May.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.377
How could you risk everything

21:28.420 --> 21:29.614
you've worked so hard for?

21:29.650 --> 21:30.639
[whispering]
Mom, could you please?

21:30.690 --> 21:32.646
Jason and Ali are inside.

21:32.690 --> 21:34.385
If they find out,
he'll kill me.

21:34.420 --> 21:35.557
So all this time,
you've been

21:35.590 --> 21:36.818
pretending to go to school

21:36.860 --> 21:38.054
while you're
running around Rosewood

21:38.090 --> 21:40.024
with my children?

21:41.400 --> 21:43.527
I'm your child too.

21:46.530 --> 21:48.589
I just wanted
to be with my family.

21:51.770 --> 21:55.433
Jason asked your father if he
could bring his girlfriend..

21:55.480 --> 21:58.472
...to the cape, he's on his way
home now to meet you.

21:58.510 --> 22:00.478
What would happen
if he found out about me?

22:02.480 --> 22:05.540
Mom, what would happen
if he found out about me?

22:05.590 --> 22:07.512
He thinks you're dead.

22:10.490 --> 22:13.027
You told him
that grave was real?

22:16.460 --> 22:18.428
Whoa, all this time..

22:18.470 --> 22:19.664
...I thought
you did that for me

22:19.700 --> 22:21.668
but you did that for you.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.668
You did that to protect you.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.109
What?

22:25.140 --> 22:27.131
You didn't just bury Charles

22:27.170 --> 22:29.377
you buried your dirty secret.

22:33.150 --> 22:37.109
I lied to him so that
you could finally be you.

22:37.150 --> 22:39.084
He never _
would have allowed It.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.679
[door opens]

22:42.720 --> 22:44.028
Okay, I know
I'm bringing a lot--

22:44.060 --> 22:45.789
Not now, Ali.

22:45.830 --> 22:48.856
(Jason)
Mom! I didn't know
you were home.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.664
This is CeCe.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.691
She was on the porch
when I pulled up.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.662
She's lovely, Jason.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.736
- Hi.
- HI.

23:01.740 --> 23:03.605
You must be CeCe.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.504
I'm Mr. DiLaurentis.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.541
So nice to meet you.

23:07.580 --> 23:10.708
But I can see you all are
getting ready to leave so..

23:10.750 --> 23:11.978
I'm gonna get out of your hair.

23:12.020 --> 23:13.954
But I thought
you were coming with us.

23:13.990 --> 23:15.719
Really? Oh, my God.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.682
This is gonna be
the best summer ever.

23:24.530 --> 23:26.464
I know you went through
a lot that summer.

23:27.700 --> 23:29.634
But we had a hell
of a lot of fun too.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.107
Ali..

23:33.140 --> 23:35.131
Every time
I remember something..

23:36.610 --> 23:38.544
...I have to look at it
differently now.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.414
We were so close.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.189
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth?

23:45.220 --> 23:46.983
I was going to.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.851
I swear.

23:48.890 --> 23:51.757
But that bitch, Bethany,
she ruined everything.

23:53.190 --> 23:55.556
She found out mom was having
an affair with her dad

23:55.600 --> 23:57.090
and she lost it.

23:57.130 --> 23:59.223
She stole my clothes,
she knew I had out privileges

23:59.270 --> 24:01.488
and she snuck out of Radley.

24:01.540 --> 24:03.462
She was gonna hurt mom.

24:08.810 --> 24:10.744
[intense music]

(Charlotte)
I swear, I thought
it was Bethany.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.517
I swear, I didn't know
it was Ali, mom.

24:48.650 --> 24:49.947

Oh, God.

24:53.090 --> 24:54.284
You have to forgive me, mom.

Please, you gotta
forgive me, mom.

[indistinct mumbling]

25:16.940 --> 25:18.703
Mona, are you okay?

25:20.210 --> 25:21.916
I killed Bethany.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.709
'I'd been sending Ali threats.‘

25:24.750 --> 25:27.082
I didn't wanna hurt her.
I just wanted to scare her.

25:27.120 --> 25:30.851
But that night, so many people
were mad at Alison.

25:30.890 --> 25:33.188
She was all alone in her yard,
and the shovel was right there.

25:33.230 --> 25:34.891
It all happened so fast.

25:34.930 --> 25:37.194
You hated Ali that much?

25:37.230 --> 25:38.822
Enough to kill her?

25:38.870 --> 25:42.135
When I hit her, all I could
hear was All berating me.

25:42.170 --> 25:45.059
Every awful thing she'd
ever said to me all at once.

25:45.970 --> 25:48.632
But if CeCe hit Ali..

25:48.680 --> 25:51.706
Bethany had blond hair, and she
was dressed just like Alison.

25:53.080 --> 25:56.072

I killed an innocent person.

25:56.120 --> 25:58.042
Bethany wasn't innocent.

26:01.360 --> 26:05.057
Jason told Emily
that he saw you that night

26:05.090 --> 26:06.352

26:06.390 --> 26:08.597
Maybe he saw...Bethany

26:08.630 --> 26:10.928
or...he-he saw you.

26:10.970 --> 26:13.097
He didn't see me.

26:13.130 --> 26:15.997
You found her on the highway,
outside of Radley.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.201
That's all
anybody needs to know.

26:18.240 --> 26:20.561
I was never in Rosewood

CeCe hired Rhys as a decoy.

He didn't even know
that he was a stooge.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.741
(CeCe on screen)
No one found out _
I was In Rosewood that nIght.'

28:12.920 --> 28:14.888
But the doctors at Radley
knew I flew the coop

28:14.920 --> 28:18.185
so...they took away
my out privileges..

28:19.890 --> 28:21.824
...and I was alone again.

28:23.460 --> 28:26.463
And then the craziest girl
showed up.

28:26.500 --> 28:27.933
'She was awesome.‘

28:27.970 --> 28:29.335
I'd sneak into_ her room
every nIght

28:29.370 --> 28:30.439

28:30.470 --> 28:32.802
She was so..

28:32.840 --> 28:34.034
...drugged up
that in the beginning

- You are?

Just keep taking your meds.

28:53.860 --> 28:55.953
I will, Ali.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.399
I promise.

28:57.430 --> 28:59.364
Tell me more about the girls.

Hearing about what she
did to those bitches

29:13.280 --> 29:16.010
was, like, the only thing
I looked forward to.

29:16.050 --> 29:18.018
So Mona did know it was you?

29:18.050 --> 29:19.540
I stopped visiting her before

29:19.590 --> 29:21.956
she snapped out
of her drugdaze.

29:23.490 --> 29:25.526
I could never trust Mona.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.221
She was Hanna's legit friend

29:27.260 --> 29:28.921
and she ran her over with a car.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.928
Where's the loyalty in that?

29:34.140 --> 29:36.165
[sighs]
I really am sorry.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.304
I know.

29:39.340 --> 29:41.535
Mona wasn't ready
to end the game.

29:41.580 --> 29:44.799
And she was like Houdini
getting in and out of places.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.841
So I made a deal with her.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.019
If she helped me
get out of Radley

29:49.050 --> 29:51.189
I'd play the game with her.

29:51.220 --> 29:55.156
It was like Bethany said,
leaving wasn't hard.

29:55.190 --> 29:57.215
ButI needed Mona's help
to stay gone.

29:58.460 --> 30:01.327
And my first assignment..

30:01.360 --> 30:03.248
...was making friends
in Rosewood.

30:03.300 --> 30:04.426
Take it from me..

30:04.470 --> 30:05.994
...you're always better off

30:06.030 --> 30:07.964
with a really good lie.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.195
Is it just me
or did that sound a lot like..

30:11.610 --> 30:13.066
(all)
...Alison?

30:16.040 --> 30:17.576
Something wrong?

30:17.610 --> 30:21.046
Oh. No. Sorry.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.981
Wow. You just sound a lot
like one of our friends.

30:24.020 --> 30:26.443
I hope she's brilliant.
What's her name?

30:26.490 --> 30:28.185
Alison DiLaurentis.

30:30.390 --> 30:32.324
You were friends of Ali's?

30:33.290 --> 30:35.349
Me too. I'm CeCe.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.925
I was doing my best

30:37.970 --> 30:40.894

30:40.940 --> 30:43.135
You should have seen the look
on those girls' faces.

30:44.270 --> 30:46.158
Oh, it was worth
a million bucks.

30:46.210 --> 30:48.098
So why did you move
back to Rosewood?

30:48.140 --> 30:50.870
Listen, I hate to make tracks,
but I'm already late

30:50.910 --> 30:53.105
and my boss is high-strung
and aggressively sober.

30:53.150 --> 30:56.313
Come visit me at the new
boutIque across the street.

30:56.350 --> 30:59.945
Oh, and if you ever feel like
doing a little free shopping..

30:59.990 --> 31:01.582
...I'd be happy
to turn the other away.

31:01.620 --> 31:04.327
I-I think you're
thinking of Hanna.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.328

those bitches were happy'

And that, oh..

31:29.550 --> 31:32.986
...that really,
really pissed me off.

31:33.020 --> 31:35.318
I mean..

31:35.360 --> 31:37.453
...those girls were
supposed to be your friends.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.525
They got what they deserved.

31:40.560 --> 31:43.620
I don't remember
telling CeCe about you.

31:43.660 --> 31:45.321
'But somebody at Radley
did start sending me'

31:47.470 --> 31:49.961
And it got me really excited
about playing the game again.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.334
I kept seeing
this blond in a Red Coat

31:54.380 --> 31:57.076
uh, w-watching the girls and I..

31:57.110 --> 31:59.146
First I thought I'd lost it.

31:59.180 --> 32:02.217
I mean,
I-I-I watched mom bury you.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.616
I knew if you were alive..

32:04.650 --> 32:06.481
...you'd show up
if the girls were in trouble.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.284
They all thought you were

32:09.320 --> 32:11.083
flying the plane that night.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.223
But I sent a decoy
to distract them.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.297
Ali?

[instrumental music]

32:37.750 --> 32:40.287

she's about to see you.

32:44.590 --> 32:46.080
She doesn't have a clue.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.428
Sara Harvey
was the other Red Coat?

32:48.460 --> 32:50.325
When I needed her to be.

32:50.360 --> 32:53.124
- What?
- No way. She's lying.

32:53.170 --> 32:56.264
And that night, she was
supposed to keep Mona busy..

32:56.300 --> 32:58.336
...while I trapped the girls.

32:58.370 --> 33:01.009
Oh, it was the perfect plan.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.235
Then Shana showed up

33:14.760 --> 33:16.614
See who?

33:16.660 --> 33:18.082
Alison.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.188
She pulled me out of there.

33:19.230 --> 33:21.357
She pulled us all out.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.652
(Aria)
'No, you're hallucinating.‘

33:23.700 --> 33:26.123
She was here. I swear it.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.421
Ali's dead.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.262
I saw her too.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.398
So did I.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.271
I knew I wasn't crazy.

33:36.310 --> 33:37.732
You really were alive.

33:37.780 --> 33:40.044
If you really cared about me..

33:41.550 --> 33:44.610
...why did you
keep playing the game?

33:44.650 --> 33:47.210
When your friends thought
they killed A in New York

33:47.250 --> 33:49.753
it was the perfect time
to end it.

33:49.790 --> 33:51.781
I left the country
thinking it was over.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.094
[speaking French]

33:58.370 --> 33:59.723
But the game..

34:00.770 --> 34:02.294
...it's like a drug.

34:02.340 --> 34:05.366
And I was really good
at playing it.

34:05.410 --> 34:08.538
And it felt great
to succeed at something.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.832
_ You attacked me
In my own IIVIng room.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.599
You were gonna leave,
and I couldn't lose you again.

34:13.650 --> 34:16.244
I-I had to make it seem real

34:16.280 --> 34:18.248
so you'd pay attention.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.178
I'm not a bad person, Ali.

34:20.220 --> 34:22.154
You almost froze Aria
and Spencer to death.

34:22.190 --> 34:23.316
Almost.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.850
You drove a car
through Emily's house!

34:24.890 --> 34:27.154
Yeah, and I almost
cut her in half too.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.351
But is she hurt? No.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.096
Is her mommy hurt? No.

34:32.130 --> 34:34.792
I only got mad
when you didn't listen.

34:37.170 --> 34:39.263
You can't steal people
from their families

34:39.310 --> 34:42.336
and lock them up to play with
them like they're your toys.

34:42.380 --> 34:45.543
Yes, I can, and I did.

34:45.580 --> 34:48.549
I know you won't believe me..

34:48.580 --> 34:50.514
...but I love all of my dolls.

34:52.620 --> 34:54.554
That's why you're still alive.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.125
I would never let anything

34:58.160 --> 35:00.822
really bad happen to them.

35:00.860 --> 35:02.657
It sucks to kill someone.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.520
Even when they deserve it.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.492
Are you talking about Wilden?

35:07.830 --> 35:09.639
He found out you were alive.

35:09.670 --> 35:11.900
Wilden was never gonna
let you come back

35:11.940 --> 35:13.669
and tell your story.

35:15.780 --> 35:16.872
Who is that?

35:22.750 --> 35:24.615
You saw the body, right?

35:28.690 --> 35:31.579
Tell me he can never
hurt my SIster agaIn.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.427
Wilden's dead.

35:35.730 --> 35:38.369
Sorry, Emily...but not really.

35:40.830 --> 35:42.297
Oh, my God!

35:44.570 --> 35:46.629
[dramatic music]

35:46.670 --> 35:48.376
Shut it off!

35:50.310 --> 35:51.607
We all saw Sara
when they brought her

35:51.650 --> 35:53.299
out of the dollhouse.

35:53.350 --> 35:56.342
Are we supposed to think that
that was an act?

35:56.380 --> 35:58.587
Em, CeCe's messing with you.

35:58.620 --> 36:00.918
She knows we're watching.
She's still playing us.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.418
That's why
Tanner is not here.

36:03.460 --> 36:04.825
Sara never called the cops.

36:04.860 --> 36:06.179
I have to get out of here.

(Hanna)
'Em, what are you doing?‘

36:08.900 --> 36:10.629
You're gonna hurt yourself.

(Aria)
'Get us the hell out of here.‘

36:13.800 --> 36:15.734
There's no way
to open this door.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.600
Spence?

36:18.640 --> 36:21.302
A always has an escape plan.

36:21.340 --> 36:23.535
'Hey, one of these
is not like the others.‘

36:23.580 --> 36:25.946
The lights, they aren't
randomly blinking on that one.

36:25.980 --> 36:27.800
It's a constant pattern.

36:31.550 --> 36:33.245
Are you making yourself
comfortable?

36:33.290 --> 36:34.951
- Getting you out of here.
- Whoa.

36:34.990 --> 36:36.309
Stand back.

36:39.260 --> 36:40.522
[glass shattering]

36:42.760 --> 36:44.022
Let's go. Come on.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.788
Mona?

36:49.840 --> 36:52.604
I have to know
how the story ends.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.335
Hanna, be careful.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.472
We will.

(CeCe on screen)
'Before I saw you in New York'

37:00.710 --> 37:02.541
I snuck home
to say goodbye to mom.

37:02.580 --> 37:06.243
And when I got there, she..

37:06.290 --> 37:08.986
When I got there...she..

37:10.920 --> 37:12.979
Mom. Mom!

37:13.030 --> 37:14.998
Mom? Mommy.

37:15.030 --> 37:17.726
Mom. Mommy.

37:19.870 --> 37:20.894
Mommy.

37:20.930 --> 37:23.694
Mommy, n-n-no, no.

Mom. Mommy.

No,no,no!

37:34.650 --> 37:36.743
No.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.680
Come on, mommy,
you can't leave me.

37:38.720 --> 37:42.713
You can't leave me.
You can't leave me. No.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.728
[sobbing]

37:44.760 --> 37:47.649
Mom was the only person
who ever really loved me.

[alarm blaring]

37:54.500 --> 37:55.637
- 'Ali!'
- Ali!

37:55.670 --> 37:57.331
Ali, where..

38:00.610 --> 38:02.601
Get out of here!

38:02.640 --> 38:05.347
All of you! Now!

38:30.870 --> 38:31.837
Damn it.

38:34.710 --> 38:36.598
Don't even think about it.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.569
She's headed to the roof!

38:39.610 --> 38:41.373
Please help me.

38:41.420 --> 38:44.514
- Hey!
- I tried to keep you safe.

[grunts]

38:47.150 --> 38:50.085
[siren blaring]

38:52.590 --> 38:54.626
We may have a visual
of the suspect on the roof.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.661
Charlotte, please
don't do this!

39:16.480 --> 39:17.879

39:42.180 --> 39:44.000
Wow, you bring enough
flip-flops, Em?

39:44.040 --> 39:45.974
It's Malibu.

39:46.010 --> 39:47.546
[both chuckle]

39:47.580 --> 39:49.116
Okay, well, you better
not come back from Savannah

39:49.150 --> 39:50.742
talking like
a southerner. You hear?

39:50.780 --> 39:52.145
Hey, you better not
come back from Georgetown

39:52.190 --> 39:53.885
talking like a politician.

39:53.920 --> 39:54.955
Yeah.

39:54.990 --> 39:56.116
[laughing]

39:56.160 --> 39:57.809
I, uh, heard that Sara

39:57.860 --> 39:59.623
got released
from the hospital today.

40:00.760 --> 40:01.920
What happened
to Sara that night

40:01.960 --> 40:03.097
wasn't our fault.

40:03.130 --> 40:05.064
I doubt that's how she sees it.

40:07.830 --> 40:10.537
You guys...I can't believe

40:10.570 --> 40:12.060
we're all actually leaving.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.032
[chuckling]

40:15.640 --> 40:18.131
Well, saying goodbye
is a lot harder

40:18.180 --> 40:20.478
than I thought it would be.

40:20.510 --> 40:22.114
"How luclq am I
to have something

"that makes
saying goodbye so hard."

What brilliant scholar
said that?

40:26.490 --> 40:27.684
Winnie the Pooh.

[all laughing]

40:35.830 --> 40:37.627
You gonna be okay?

40:37.660 --> 40:40.094
Yeah...I spent
my whole life dreaming

40:40.130 --> 40:41.939
about getting away from here.

40:41.970 --> 40:43.460
But right now,
this is the only place

40:43.500 --> 40:45.468
I wanna be.
