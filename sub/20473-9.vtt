Do you know what Fritz

00:02.131 --> 00:03.165
<i>has been working on?</i>

00:03.166 --> 00:06.367
(coughing, shouting)

00:06.368 --> 00:08.544
<i>He's responsible for
thousands of deaths.</i>

00:08.545 --> 00:09.989
You may have changed your religion,

00:09.990 --> 00:10.985
but don't think for a second

00:10.986 --> 00:12.247
you can change your heritage.

00:12.248 --> 00:15.002
But if the worst disputes
between warring nations

00:15.003 --> 00:18.052
<i>can be resolved, can't two
old friends make peace?</i>

00:18.053 --> 00:20.901
I would like you to meet my
good friend, Dr. Niels Bohr.

00:20.902 --> 00:23.256
Are you familiar with Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle?

00:23.257 --> 00:24.657
<i>What about Margot and Ilse?</i>

00:24.658 --> 00:26.530
ELSA: <i>They're determined
to make their lives here.</i>

00:26.531 --> 00:28.929
Perhaps they'll change their
minds once they see how happy

00:28.930 --> 00:30.589
<i>a person can be in New Jersey.</i>

00:30.590 --> 00:32.762
I am conducting this
inquiry at the request

00:32.764 --> 00:35.032
<i>- of Mr. J. Edgar Hoover.</i>
- EINSTEIN: <i>Hoover?</i>

00:35.033 --> 00:36.601
What does he want with me?

00:36.602 --> 00:38.169
SECRETARY: <i>Dr. Lenard, it's an honor.</i>

00:38.170 --> 00:39.169
<i>He's expecting you, sir.</i>

00:39.170 --> 00:41.105
<i>Heil, mein Fuhrer!</i>

00:41.106 --> 00:42.975

HALLIWELL: The intelligence
is thin, I'll admit,

01:17.408 --> 01:20.132
but if it's accurate, well, then...

01:20.856 --> 01:22.765
we'd all better start
learning to speak German

02:44.372 --> 02:45.925
GOEBBELS: <i>Congratulations, Dr. Lenard.</i>

02:45.926 --> 02:48.332
The Fuhrer, in his wisdom,

02:48.333 --> 02:51.380
has decided to reward
your early support

02:51.381 --> 02:52.904
and continued loyalty

02:52.905 --> 02:56.039
by appointing you
Chief of Aryan Physics.

02:57.206 --> 03:00.002
I am humbled and grateful,
Dr. Goebbels.

03:00.003 --> 03:04.149
Please inform the Fuhrer
that my first order of business

03:04.150 --> 03:06.392
will be to reclaim the
glory of German science

03:06.393 --> 03:08.297
by purging the Prussian Academy

03:08.298 --> 03:10.601
of all foreign and impure influences.

03:10.602 --> 03:13.365
We must do more than inform the Fuhrer.

03:13.366 --> 03:15.363
We must inform the people.

03:15.364 --> 03:17.666
In a manner that will
forever burn this moment

03:17.667 --> 03:18.988
into their memory.

03:18.989 --> 03:20.279
<i>The era</i>

03:20.280 --> 03:23.597
of exaggerated Jewish intellectualism

03:23.598 --> 03:25.747
is now at an end!

03:25.748 --> 03:29.280
The triumph of the German Revolution

03:29.281 --> 03:33.030
has again cleared a path
for the German way.

03:33.031 --> 03:37.423
And the future German man will
not only be a man of books,

03:37.424 --> 03:41.726
but also a man of character.

03:41.950 --> 03:45.791
And, thus, you do well
in this midnight hour

03:45.792 --> 03:50.153
to commit to the flames
the evil spirit of the past.

03:50.154 --> 03:51.290
<i>Sieg...</i>

03:51.291 --> 03:52.672

03:52.673 --> 03:53.687

ELSA: <i>Albert,</i>

04:14.834 --> 04:16.522
<i>they have raided our apartment.</i>

04:16.523 --> 04:18.704
The cottage as well.

04:18.704 --> 04:20.916
What were they hoping
to find, my supply of...

04:20.916 --> 04:22.452
contraband tobacco?

04:22.453 --> 04:24.664
Margot says that they
were looking for guns.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.691
They claimed to have intelligence

04:26.692 --> 04:29.211
that you were hiding them
for communist insurgents.

04:29.212 --> 04:32.038
Well, that's a very liberal use
of the word "intelligence."

04:32.039 --> 04:34.356
The girls have managed
to save most of your papers.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.567
Poor Herr Hitler.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.043
What will he use for kindling

04:38.044 --> 04:40.255
the next time he wishes
to read by the fire?

04:40.256 --> 04:42.406
- This isn't funny, Albert.
- I know.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.802
That is why we must fight, Elsa.

04:44.803 --> 04:47.260
Fight Hitler however we can.

04:47.261 --> 04:48.796
We haven't any guns.

04:48.797 --> 04:50.331
I have a voice. I can write.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.802
I can speak out,
tell anyone who will listen

04:52.803 --> 04:54.151
that this man is a threat,

04:54.152 --> 04:56.241
that other governments must use

04:56.242 --> 04:59.253
all peaceful means to oppose him.

05:02.663 --> 05:06.504
Margot says that Ilse's
condition is getting worse.

05:09.638 --> 05:12.401
That is not good news, my love.

05:12.402 --> 05:16.313
We must get her out of Germany.

05:16.314 --> 05:18.740
And the rest of our family and friends.

05:18.741 --> 05:20.246
Use your voice for that.

05:20.247 --> 05:21.783
HELEN: The car is here.

05:21.784 --> 05:23.535
Oh, thank you, Helen.

05:23.536 --> 05:25.071
You go ahead.

05:25.072 --> 05:26.607
I'll-I'll be just a moment.

05:26.608 --> 05:28.082
Don't be too long.

05:28.083 --> 05:29.770
Flexner has threatened to feed me

05:29.771 --> 05:32.538
to the famous Princeton
Tigers if I'm late again.

05:51.147 --> 05:53.235
The Nazis are fanatics.

05:53.236 --> 05:55.140
American capitalists such as yourself

05:55.141 --> 05:57.545
must refuse to do business
with them, Mr. Mills.

05:57.546 --> 05:59.435
I'm surprised a man of your background

05:59.436 --> 06:01.166
needs a lesson in
capitalism, Professor.

06:01.167 --> 06:03.442
It doesn't work by refusing

06:03.443 --> 06:04.595
to do business with people.

06:04.596 --> 06:05.687
FLEXNER: <i>You're here</i>

06:05.688 --> 06:07.609
to <i>attract</i> donors, Albert,

06:07.610 --> 06:10.334
- not to chase them away.
- Oh, my mistake.

06:10.335 --> 06:13.637
I was under the impression my
job here was to pursue science,

06:13.638 --> 06:15.976
not to be the collector
for your coffers.

06:15.977 --> 06:19.085
Most of these people
are put off as it is,

06:19.086 --> 06:21.393
having so many Jews on the faculty.

06:21.394 --> 06:24.054
(quietly): They don't want our
politics thrown in their faces.

06:24.055 --> 06:26.361
Albert, look who I have just met.

06:26.362 --> 06:28.446
This is Mr. Henry Morgenthau.

06:28.447 --> 06:32.068
He is Secretary of the
Treasury for Mr. Roosevelt.

06:32.069 --> 06:33.606
An honor to meet you, Professor.

06:33.607 --> 06:34.985
Morgenthau.

06:34.986 --> 06:37.550
- A Jewish name?
- As a matter of fact, yes.

06:37.551 --> 06:39.441
Bar mitzvah boy in '04.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.525
- Corned beef on rye.
- (chuckles)

06:41.526 --> 06:44.088
A Jew who's also a politician.

06:44.089 --> 06:46.012
How very interesting.

06:46.013 --> 06:48.321
Albert, I was thinking
maybe Mr. Morgenthau

06:48.322 --> 06:49.698
could give us some advice

06:49.699 --> 06:53.225
on getting our friends out of Germany.

06:53.226 --> 06:54.732
- Get up. Let's go.
- (grunts)

06:54.733 --> 06:57.392
- On your feet, you kike.
- Move! Move!

06:57.393 --> 06:58.899
Where are you taking them?

06:58.900 --> 07:00.501
No Jews in government posts.

07:00.502 --> 07:01.944
That includes this laboratory.

07:01.945 --> 07:04.605
This is an outrage.
How am I to continue my work?

07:04.606 --> 07:07.169
I'm sure you will manage.

07:07.170 --> 07:09.478
Your people are nothing if not clever.

07:09.479 --> 07:10.760
My people?

07:10.761 --> 07:12.490
What are you insinuating?

07:12.491 --> 07:15.055
We know you were not born a Lutheran.

07:15.056 --> 07:19.286
Or would you care to drop your
trousers and prove us wrong?

07:19.287 --> 07:23.517
(whispers): How-how dare you
speak to me in such a manner?

07:23.518 --> 07:27.108
Your Jew-loving friends
cannot protect you forever...

07:27.109 --> 07:28.648
Haber.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.736
PLANCK: <i>Fritz is a German patriot.</i>

07:34.737 --> 07:38.007
He was the first among us to
raise his hand in the Great War.

07:38.008 --> 07:40.028
He's also a Jew.

07:41.150 --> 07:43.648
Yes, Philipp, but... (chuckles)

07:43.649 --> 07:45.571
...there are Jews and, uh...

07:45.572 --> 07:47.719
and then there are Jews.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.195
I'm told you have already
pressed this matter

07:49.196 --> 07:50.541
with the Fuhrer himself.

07:50.542 --> 07:53.874
- Did he not give you a clear answer?
- Yes,

07:53.875 --> 07:56.728
but we cannot turn our backs on Fritz.

07:56.729 --> 07:58.940
He has been a colleague
and a friend for decades.

07:58.965 --> 07:59.677
Yes,

07:59.678 --> 08:02.497
and for decades you supported
the likes of Haber and Einstein

08:02.498 --> 08:05.382
while they destroyed the
purity of German science.

08:05.383 --> 08:07.690
But the Academy is obsolete, Max.

08:07.691 --> 08:11.121
I am in charge of science
in this country now.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.742
Make no mistake, Philipp,

08:14.743 --> 08:18.589
the Fuhrer appointed you
not for your shining intellect,

08:18.590 --> 08:20.834
but for your depraved politics.

08:20.835 --> 08:22.757
(scoffs softly)

08:22.758 --> 08:23.752
MORGENTHAU: <i>I'm afraid there's nothing</i>

08:23.753 --> 08:26.043
I can do to help your
friend Professor Haber.

08:26.044 --> 08:27.495
No university in
America wants the stain

08:27.496 --> 08:29.097
of a war criminal on its faculty.

08:29.098 --> 08:30.990
I feared that might happen.

08:30.991 --> 08:34.385
- Poor Fritz.
- The good news is

08:34.386 --> 08:36.375
the State Department has
agreed to issue visas

08:36.376 --> 08:38.136
to several of those on your list.

08:38.138 --> 08:39.323
Betty Neumann.

08:39.323 --> 08:41.696
Your son Hans and his family.

08:41.697 --> 08:43.427
Your wife's daughter, Margot.

08:43.428 --> 08:45.030
Thank you.

08:45.031 --> 08:47.787
But what about my other
stepdaughter, Ilse?

08:47.788 --> 08:49.516
She's sick with tuberculosis.

08:49.517 --> 08:52.018
Elsa's gone to Paris to
take care of her, but...

08:52.019 --> 08:54.070
we want to bring her
here for treatment.

08:54.071 --> 08:55.319
The immigration laws

08:55.320 --> 08:58.588
exclude anyone with medical conditions.

08:58.589 --> 09:01.250
No one is admitted who might
become a burden to the state.

09:01.251 --> 09:02.212
I would, of course,

09:02.213 --> 09:03.879
pay for her care.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.738
I'm afraid we're facing

09:05.739 --> 09:08.687
- the same obstacle with your son, Eduard.
- Mr. Secretary,

09:08.688 --> 09:11.507
I promised him. Is there any way
you can make an exception?

09:11.508 --> 09:12.918
I'm sorry,

09:12.919 --> 09:15.035
my hands are tied.

09:20.524 --> 09:22.381
ELSA: Princeton is so lovely.

09:22.382 --> 09:24.914
We have a pretty little garden

09:24.915 --> 09:28.281
with a magnificent elm tree.

09:37.718 --> 09:41.051
Albert is getting
everyone's visas in order.

09:41.052 --> 09:45.638
And soon we shall all be
together in our little house.

09:51.408 --> 09:53.392
PLANCK: <i>It's like a slow death,</i>

09:53.393 --> 09:55.316
all of my good friends leaving.

09:55.317 --> 09:57.624
I know you did everything
you could, Max.

09:57.625 --> 09:59.676
PLANCK: Germany has
betrayed you, Fritz.

09:59.677 --> 10:01.278
No.

10:01.279 --> 10:04.709
The Nazis have betrayed Germany.

10:04.710 --> 10:06.889
But when they are gone,

10:06.890 --> 10:09.391
I'll come home. <i>Ja.</i>

10:10.769 --> 10:12.530
We all will.

10:12.531 --> 10:13.909
(exhales)

10:13.910 --> 10:15.896
Palestine. (chuckles) Imagine that.

10:15.897 --> 10:18.396
(chuckles softly) It's ironic.

10:18.397 --> 10:20.962
I warned Albert not to get
involved with the Zionists,

10:20.963 --> 10:23.269
and now it's the only place
on God's earth

10:23.270 --> 10:24.904
I seem to be welcome.

10:24.905 --> 10:26.956
Perhaps the climate
will be good for your heart.

10:26.957 --> 10:27.918
<i>Ja.</i>

10:27.919 --> 10:29.295
I will admit,

10:29.296 --> 10:31.734
it could use some healing.

10:32.663 --> 10:35.546
(train whistle blowing)

10:35.547 --> 10:37.663
- (bell clanging)
- (indistinct chatter)

10:37.664 --> 10:39.810
(grunts)

10:39.811 --> 10:41.832
(sighs)

10:46.446 --> 10:48.851
(grunts)

11:01.112 --> 11:03.643
I'm sorry to disturb you, Frau.

11:03.644 --> 11:06.496
Is there anything I can help you with?

11:06.497 --> 11:09.512
No, thank you, Helen. I'm all right.

11:12.460 --> 11:15.439
I just wanted to say again...

11:15.440 --> 11:18.357
how very sorry I am about Ilse.

11:18.358 --> 11:21.241
She was very fond of you.

11:21.242 --> 11:24.127
We all are.

11:24.128 --> 11:26.981
You have become part of the family.

11:28.615 --> 11:31.822
I am honored you would say so.

11:36.534 --> 11:40.058
Perhaps it is time to make you...

11:40.059 --> 11:43.199
a signatory on our bank accounts.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.766
I'm not sure I understand.

11:47.015 --> 11:50.252
Albert cannot handle money at all.

11:50.253 --> 11:53.555
He will need you to do it for him.

12:07.851 --> 12:09.454
(groans softly)

12:21.411 --> 12:22.887
(exhales loudly)

12:56.032 --> 12:59.011
Fritz is dead.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.576
Oh, Albert.

13:01.577 --> 13:03.982
No.

13:05.233 --> 13:07.474
Your dearest daughter

13:07.475 --> 13:09.622
and now this?

13:15.060 --> 13:16.117
Where are you going?

13:16.118 --> 13:17.560
To work.

13:17.561 --> 13:19.386
Oh, Albert, scratching equations

13:19.387 --> 13:21.117
will not bring Fritz or Ilse back.

13:21.118 --> 13:23.265
I cannot talk about this, Elsa.

13:23.266 --> 13:24.676
I simply cannot.

13:24.677 --> 13:26.438
Who said anything about talking?

13:26.439 --> 13:28.202
Come, sit with me.

13:28.203 --> 13:30.125
My eyes are tired.

13:30.126 --> 13:33.491
It would be so wonderful
if you would read to me

13:33.492 --> 13:34.869
like you used to.

13:34.870 --> 13:37.370
It will take our minds off our cares.

13:37.371 --> 13:39.453
Bohr and Podolsky are expecting me.

13:39.454 --> 13:40.704
They will understand.

13:40.705 --> 13:42.082
Please, Albert.

13:42.083 --> 13:43.397
It's only for a little while.

13:43.398 --> 13:44.807
It's Tolstoy.

13:44.808 --> 13:46.764
Your favorite.

13:48.110 --> 13:50.834
I cannot keep them waiting.

13:50.835 --> 13:53.944
(door opens, closes)

13:55.579 --> 13:57.352
(bell tolling)

13:57.353 --> 14:01.102
LAUE: <i>Albert wrote and asked
me to read this to all of you.</i>

14:01.103 --> 14:02.546
(clears throat)

14:02.547 --> 14:05.687
"My good friend Haber
was a man of endless curiosity

14:05.688 --> 14:07.194
"and a passion for discovery.

14:07.195 --> 14:08.476
"He wanted to share

14:08.477 --> 14:10.334
"his genius with his country.

14:10.335 --> 14:12.802
"That mattered more to him
than anything else,

14:12.803 --> 14:15.465
"and thus his bitter end
is the tragic story of...

14:15.466 --> 14:16.907
(car doors close outside)

14:16.908 --> 14:20.335
...the unrequited love
of the German Jew."

14:20.336 --> 14:22.324
The SS are outside.

14:22.325 --> 14:24.344
We must finish before
they discover what we are doing.

14:24.345 --> 14:26.459
The entire country
should be honoring Fritz,

14:26.460 --> 14:28.414
Dr. Heisenberg. Instead,

14:28.415 --> 14:29.794
we skulk like cowards.

14:29.795 --> 14:31.235
What other choice do we have?

14:31.236 --> 14:34.217
If this is what we have come to,

14:34.218 --> 14:36.205
perhaps we should leave
like Albert did.

14:36.206 --> 14:37.445
No.

14:37.446 --> 14:38.887
It is our duty to stay,

14:38.888 --> 14:41.322
to ensure the future of German science.

14:41.323 --> 14:43.695
KONENKOV: <i>Art is like science, Albert.</i>

14:43.696 --> 14:45.555
It cannot be rushed.

14:45.556 --> 14:48.279
Forgive my impatience, Sergei, but...

14:48.280 --> 14:51.870
how much longer is this going to take?

14:51.871 --> 14:53.409
(sighs)

14:53.410 --> 14:57.578
An eternity, if you do not hold still.

14:58.475 --> 14:59.980
Hello, darling.

14:59.981 --> 15:01.936
Can you not see that I am working?

15:01.937 --> 15:04.885
Aren't you going to introduce me?

15:04.886 --> 15:06.743
Dr. Einstein,

15:06.744 --> 15:08.218
my wife, Margarita.

15:08.219 --> 15:11.359
It's an honor to meet such a great man.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.475
I would rise to greet
you properly, madam,

15:13.476 --> 15:15.783
but unfortunately, your
husband has accepted

15:15.784 --> 15:18.988
a very generous commission
from my boss, Mr. Flexner,

15:18.989 --> 15:21.810
designed to keep me permanently silent,

15:21.811 --> 15:24.919
immobile and on display.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.228
(chuckles)

15:28.928 --> 15:30.433
Mm. It's off

15:30.434 --> 15:32.455
to a fine start.

15:34.536 --> 15:36.364
But I'm afraid

15:36.365 --> 15:39.121
you have not made Dr. Einstein
nearly handsome enough.

15:42.038 --> 15:43.800
(chuckles softly)

15:43.801 --> 15:45.596
ROOSEVELT: <i>Fourth or fifth?</i>

15:45.597 --> 15:47.199
EINSTEIN: <i>I beg your pardon?</i>

15:47.200 --> 15:48.737
Your wife. She's your cousin.

15:48.738 --> 15:50.243
So is mine.

15:50.244 --> 15:51.621
Fourth or fifth?

15:51.622 --> 15:53.769
Elsa and I are first cousins.

15:53.770 --> 15:57.424
Oh, well, you Europeans
are certainly more permissive

15:57.425 --> 15:58.995
than we Yankees.

15:58.996 --> 16:00.982
Speaking of Europe, Mr. President,

16:00.983 --> 16:02.841
- I was hoping...
- Come, now, Professor.

16:02.842 --> 16:05.277
I didn't invite the world's
most brilliant scientist

16:05.278 --> 16:07.233
to dinner to talk politics. No.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.964
I was hoping you could explain to me

16:08.965 --> 16:11.751
this famous relativity theory of yours

16:11.752 --> 16:14.059
that's got everyone
scratching their heads.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.367
If I explain relativity to you

16:16.368 --> 16:18.226
in a way that you can understand,

16:18.227 --> 16:21.881
will you grant me a few
moments to discuss Germany?

16:21.882 --> 16:23.261
It's a deal.

16:27.330 --> 16:29.509
If you are standing on hot coals,

16:29.510 --> 16:31.786
a second feels like an eternity.

16:31.787 --> 16:34.222
But when you are in bed
with a beautiful woman,

16:34.223 --> 16:36.627
an hour passes in a split second.

16:36.628 --> 16:39.030
(both laugh)

16:39.031 --> 16:41.370
That is relativity.

16:41.371 --> 16:43.133
You win, Professor.

16:43.134 --> 16:45.056
But I know what you are going to say.

16:45.057 --> 16:46.531
You want me to take a stand

16:46.532 --> 16:48.007
against Mr. Hitler.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.378
America must lead the
world in opposing him.

16:50.379 --> 16:52.655
Boycotts, blockades...

16:52.656 --> 16:54.865
In a way, I envy the little bastard.

16:54.866 --> 16:57.271
He does whatever he wants.

16:57.272 --> 16:59.739
But in this country,
no man, not even the president,

16:59.740 --> 17:01.310
can act alone.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.170
Then you must persuade Congress.

17:03.171 --> 17:05.092
I'm sorry I can't help you, Professor.

17:05.093 --> 17:09.260
But allow me to offer
a small consolation.

17:09.261 --> 17:11.407
I understand you're
applying for citizenship.

17:11.409 --> 17:13.588
I could expedite the process for you.

17:13.589 --> 17:15.351
Thank you, sir.

17:15.352 --> 17:17.017
But I don't want any special treatment.

17:17.018 --> 17:19.006
That's very noble
of you, Professor, but

17:19.095 --> 17:21.108
the citizenship test
requires a lot of study.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.689
Promise me you'll save
some of that brain power

17:22.690 --> 17:24.133
for science.

17:24.134 --> 17:26.122
EINSTEIN: <i>Imagine two particles.</i>

17:28.238 --> 17:30.288
Measure their mass.

17:30.289 --> 17:32.149
Stick them together.

17:34.071 --> 17:36.378
Let them spring apart.

17:36.379 --> 17:37.981
What happens?

17:37.982 --> 17:40.320
Their positions and their
velocities are related,

17:40.321 --> 17:41.667
- but...
- The uncertainty principle

17:41.668 --> 17:43.942
says if we measure
the position of one...

17:43.943 --> 17:45.590
- Then we cannot measure its velocity.
- Ah.

17:45.591 --> 17:47.160
But we can still measure the velocity

17:47.161 --> 17:48.507
of that second particle.

17:48.508 --> 17:51.035
And since they are both
mathematically related,

17:51.036 --> 17:52.546
we can then determine the velocity

17:52.547 --> 17:53.923
of the first particle,

17:53.924 --> 17:56.617
so we'd know both
its position and velocity

17:56.618 --> 17:59.599
without having to measure them both.

18:04.695 --> 18:07.388
Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle disproved.

18:07.389 --> 18:09.118
With certainty.

18:09.119 --> 18:10.753
You are vanquished, sir.

18:10.754 --> 18:12.228
Hmm, but...

18:12.229 --> 18:14.023
what if the act of measuring
the first particle

18:14.024 --> 18:15.529
influenced the second,

18:15.530 --> 18:17.773
changed it somehow at the
time it was measured?

18:17.774 --> 18:19.120
Impossible. That would be...

18:19.121 --> 18:21.395
spooky action at a distance.

18:21.396 --> 18:23.415
"Spooky action."

18:23.416 --> 18:25.146
You're a better poet
than you are a scientist.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.333
(chuckles)

18:26.334 --> 18:28.384
Surrender now,

18:28.385 --> 18:30.372
and I will offer you generous terms.

18:30.373 --> 18:32.295
Well, what did you have in mind?

18:32.296 --> 18:35.788
Elsa has made some wonderful strudel.

18:35.789 --> 18:37.264
Helen!

18:37.265 --> 18:39.348
Bring us some strudel!

18:41.046 --> 18:43.676
Helen?

18:44.733 --> 18:47.202
I've been calling you.

19:10.973 --> 19:13.376
It's as we suspected, Mrs. Einstein.

19:13.377 --> 19:16.262
Late stages of myocarditis.

19:16.263 --> 19:19.082
EINSTEIN: So...

19:19.083 --> 19:20.815
how do we treat it?

19:22.867 --> 19:25.207
I'll give you some time to
be alone with your husband.

19:31.118 --> 19:33.490
Elsa?

19:38.842 --> 19:42.528
How could you keep this from me?

19:42.529 --> 19:44.579
I didn't want to worry you.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.729
You have...

19:46.730 --> 19:50.172
so much else in your mind.

19:50.173 --> 19:51.998
Your science, your committees...

19:51.999 --> 19:53.378
(sobs)

19:53.379 --> 19:56.167
Don't worry.

19:56.168 --> 19:58.026
Helen can take me home.

19:58.027 --> 19:59.628
You can go to work.

19:59.629 --> 20:02.386
I know that is what you need.

20:05.047 --> 20:08.670
I think I should like

23:11.956 --> 23:13.495
(gasps) Ooh.

23:13.496 --> 23:16.284
Hmm.

23:16.285 --> 23:17.950
Mmm.

23:17.951 --> 23:19.328
Mmm. Delicious.

23:19.329 --> 23:20.996
Oh.

23:20.997 --> 23:23.721
- More cinnamon this time?
- Mmm.

23:23.722 --> 23:26.957
Maybe you're just learning
to like Russian sweets.

23:26.958 --> 23:29.170
- Hmm.
- SPORTSCASTER: <i>Swing and a miss.</i>

23:29.171 --> 23:32.952
<i>That's strike three for Moe Berg.</i>

23:32.953 --> 23:34.458
<i>Moe might not swing the bat like he did</i>

23:34.459 --> 23:36.896
<i>when he first came up 15 years ago,</i>

23:36.897 --> 23:40.101
<i>but he still has a cannon for an arm.</i>

23:40.102 --> 23:42.632
(whistling
"Take Me Out to the Ballgame")

23:42.633 --> 23:44.846
<i>Berg's the smartest man in baseball.</i>

23:44.847 --> 23:47.634
<i>Lawyer, Princeton grad,</i>

23:47.635 --> 23:50.422
<i>reads as many as ten newspapers a day,</i>

23:50.423 --> 23:52.121
<i>speaks seven languages.</i>

23:52.122 --> 23:53.853
He is very smart.

23:53.854 --> 23:55.552
Which reminds me,

23:55.553 --> 23:58.130
you promised you'd help me
prepare for my citizenship test,

23:58.131 --> 24:01.178
not to distract me with baseball.

24:03.036 --> 24:04.287
Shall we go to my study?

24:04.288 --> 24:07.590
I'd prefer you take me to bed.

24:10.987 --> 24:13.261
But you are married.

24:13.262 --> 24:15.505
Were you never unfaithful
to your wife, Albert?

24:15.506 --> 24:17.846
Yes.

24:17.847 --> 24:19.868
Quite often, in fact.

24:21.726 --> 24:24.352
We had an understanding.

24:24.353 --> 24:26.823
Then what is the problem?

24:29.323 --> 24:32.815
It's funny. When Elsa was alive, I...

24:32.816 --> 24:35.478
I never felt any guilt
about other women.

24:37.561 --> 24:41.278
Now that she's gone...

24:41.279 --> 24:44.389
I somehow feel I'd be betraying her.

24:57.692 --> 24:59.937
It's been years, Albert.

25:02.148 --> 25:05.769
I know you still miss
her very much, but...

25:05.770 --> 25:08.944
you must be so lonely without her.

25:28.563 --> 25:31.317
<i>How many years does a senator serve?</i>

25:31.318 --> 25:33.849
- Four.
- No, Albert,

25:33.850 --> 25:35.165
this is the president.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.960
Oh.

25:36.961 --> 25:38.242
Two?

25:38.243 --> 25:39.812
No, this is the congressman.

25:39.813 --> 25:42.024
- A senator serves six.
- (chuckling)

25:42.025 --> 25:45.134
Now, the electoral college.

25:45.135 --> 25:46.833
No, please. It makes no sense.

25:46.834 --> 25:49.559
(knocking at door)

25:52.636 --> 25:53.878
I know what you're going to say.

25:53.879 --> 25:56.538
She's a married woman
and I'm a foolish old man.

25:56.539 --> 26:00.098
I was going to say there's
a Mr. Szilard here to see you.

26:01.989 --> 26:03.399
SZILARD: <i>Every split</i>

26:03.400 --> 26:05.291
would cause...

26:05.292 --> 26:07.214
EINSTEIN: A tremendous chain reaction.

26:07.215 --> 26:10.386
You discovered this,
Albert, decades ago.

26:10.387 --> 26:12.695
Energy equals mass times
the speed of light squared.

26:12.696 --> 26:15.355
Which means with only
this much material

26:15.356 --> 26:18.336
you can destroy a city
the size of Berlin.

26:18.337 --> 26:20.997
God help us all.

26:20.998 --> 26:22.439
Albert...

26:22.440 --> 26:24.524
you are the most famous
scientist in the world.

26:24.525 --> 26:26.254
You must tell the president.

26:26.255 --> 26:27.583
What should I say to the president?

26:27.584 --> 26:29.323
That America's scientists
must build a bomb

26:29.324 --> 26:30.540
before the Germans do.

26:30.541 --> 26:31.787
I'm a devout pacifist.

26:31.788 --> 26:32.747
Hitler is a madman.

26:32.748 --> 26:34.542
Imagine how he would use such a weapon.

26:34.543 --> 26:36.400
He could obliterate London, Moscow.

26:36.401 --> 26:38.676
Many years ago,
Fritz Haber tried to convince me

26:38.677 --> 26:40.600
his poison gas would
end the war more quickly.

26:40.601 --> 26:42.427
It only made it more horrific.

26:42.428 --> 26:45.922
Science must never
be used for violence.

26:45.923 --> 26:48.132
Do you think Adolph Hitler

26:48.133 --> 26:49.639
shares your moral reservations?

26:49.640 --> 26:50.921
You must contact Roosevelt.

26:50.922 --> 26:52.205
He will listen to you.

26:52.206 --> 26:55.505
That's the trouble, Leo.

26:55.506 --> 26:58.200
What if he does?

27:01.277 --> 27:03.808
WEIZSACKER: <i>Achieving
an atomic chain reaction</i>

27:03.809 --> 27:05.250
will be the greatest feat

27:05.251 --> 27:08.135
in the history of German science.

27:08.136 --> 27:10.060
And to think,

27:10.061 --> 27:13.139
the Fuhrer has put you
in charge of all of it.

27:17.945 --> 27:19.966
Carl...

27:26.793 --> 27:30.064
What if we succeed?

27:31.218 --> 27:33.363
Then they will write books about us.

27:33.364 --> 27:36.121
The Fuhrer himself

27:36.122 --> 27:37.979
- will pin medals on our chests.
- (chuckles softly)

27:37.980 --> 27:39.872
We shall be heroes.

27:57.535 --> 27:59.747
HELEN: Something
troubling you, Professor?

28:01.222 --> 28:03.623
I do not suppose I have
ever felt more uncertain

28:03.624 --> 28:07.216
about whether or not
what I'm doing is right.

28:09.043 --> 28:11.705
What would Frau Einstein
have advised you to do?

28:13.563 --> 28:15.646
I expect she would have reminded me

28:15.647 --> 28:19.109
that I once told her we must
fight Hitler however we can.

28:21.159 --> 28:23.180
Then you have your answer.

28:30.585 --> 28:33.756
God forgive me if I'm making
a terrible mistake.

28:33.757 --> 28:37.476
<i>"Based on this new phenomenon,
it is conceivable,</i>

28:37.477 --> 28:39.559
<i>"though much less certain,</i>

28:39.560 --> 28:41.610
<i>"that an extremely powerful bomb</i>

28:41.611 --> 28:43.982
<i>of a new type may be constructed."</i>

28:43.983 --> 28:46.226
- <i>A single bomb..."</i>
- ROOSEVELT: "A single bomb of this type,

28:46.227 --> 28:48.664
"carried by boat
and exploded in a port,

28:48.665 --> 28:49.945
"might very well destroy

28:49.946 --> 28:52.028
"the whole port together

28:52.029 --> 28:53.951
with some of the surrounding
territory."

28:53.952 --> 28:55.619
Good God.

28:55.620 --> 28:57.477
I don't need to tell you
what could happen

28:57.478 --> 29:01.005
if the Germans develop
this technology before we do.

29:01.006 --> 29:02.895
We'll all be doing the goose step.

29:02.896 --> 29:04.563
Or worse.

29:04.564 --> 29:08.217
Which is why I'm asking you
to take charge of a program

29:08.218 --> 29:11.871
to research and develop
an atomic weapon.

29:11.872 --> 29:14.595
It'd require tremendous resources.

29:14.596 --> 29:17.033
Of that I have no doubt.

29:17.034 --> 29:19.469
I'd need wide latitude
to manage the project...

29:19.470 --> 29:21.392
the scientists, the military,

29:21.393 --> 29:22.675
clandestine operations.

29:22.676 --> 29:24.693
Secrecy would be vital, sir.

29:24.694 --> 29:26.778
We couldn't let the Krauts get onto us.

29:26.779 --> 29:28.619
Everyone involved
will need security clearance.

29:29.550 --> 29:31.322
Einstein?

29:31.323 --> 29:34.324
No, Einstein is out.

29:34.325 --> 29:36.441
You haven't even
run his background, Edgar.

29:36.442 --> 29:40.031
The Bureau has been concerned
about Einstein for years.

29:40.032 --> 29:41.954
He's a radical.

29:41.955 --> 29:43.236
Almost certainly a communist.

29:43.237 --> 29:44.679
He's the man who informed the president

29:44.680 --> 29:46.794
of the urgency of this matter.

29:46.795 --> 29:48.365
He cannot be trusted

29:48.366 --> 29:51.154
to be loyal to our country.

29:51.155 --> 29:53.751
SEVERAL PEOPLE:
<i>I will support and defend</i>

29:53.752 --> 29:55.899
the Constitution and laws

29:55.900 --> 29:58.046
of the United States of America...

29:58.047 --> 30:01.701
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

30:01.702 --> 30:05.516
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

30:05.517 --> 30:08.305
JUDGE: ...that I will bear arms
on behalf of the United States

30:08.306 --> 30:10.068
when required by the law.

30:10.069 --> 30:13.786
...that I will bear arms
on behalf of the United States

30:13.787 --> 30:16.575
when required by the law.

30:16.576 --> 30:18.754
MARGARITA: <i>Albert, you have
just become an American.</i>

30:18.755 --> 30:21.063
Why ever would you
want to learn Russian?

30:21.064 --> 30:24.109
So I can tell you I love you
in your own language.

30:30.231 --> 30:31.993
(clears throat)

30:31.994 --> 30:34.782
<i>Ya tebya lyublyu.</i>

30:34.783 --> 30:37.250
<i>Ya teba...</i>

30:37.251 --> 30:38.790
<i>lyu... lyublyu?</i>

30:38.791 --> 30:41.257
<i>Lyublyu.</i> (chuckles)

30:41.258 --> 30:43.856
<i>Ya tebya lyublyu.</i>

30:45.619 --> 30:47.638
<i>Ya tebya lyublyu.</i>

30:56.390 --> 30:58.440
Oh, uh, I-I'm sorry, I didn't, uh...

30:58.441 --> 31:00.362
Oh, Leo.

31:00.363 --> 31:01.549
How wonderful to see you.

31:01.550 --> 31:03.280
You remember my friend, Margarita.

31:03.281 --> 31:04.850
- Hello.
- She's teaching me Russian.

31:04.851 --> 31:06.197
(chuckles)

31:06.198 --> 31:08.697
Yes. Very nice to see you again, madam.

31:08.698 --> 31:09.724
I do beg your pardon.

31:09.725 --> 31:10.847
Come in, come in.

31:12.417 --> 31:14.981
Please forgive us, Margarita. (kisses)

31:14.982 --> 31:17.577
Why don't you make us some
of your delicious piroshki?

31:17.578 --> 31:19.214
Of course.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.567
(door closes)

31:26.714 --> 31:28.476
They rejected me.

31:28.477 --> 31:30.528
Who did?

31:30.529 --> 31:31.938
The atomic bomb program.

31:31.939 --> 31:33.572
They won't give me
a security clearance.

31:33.573 --> 31:36.458
I need you to put in a word for me.

31:36.459 --> 31:38.958
They didn't give me a
security clearance either.

31:38.959 --> 31:41.138
- What?
- Frankly, it's a relief.

31:41.139 --> 31:42.644
It's one thing to write a letter,

31:42.645 --> 31:45.242
another thing entirely
to help build a bomb.

31:48.094 --> 31:50.210
So you find a Russian girlfriend

31:50.211 --> 31:52.582
and now I have no one
to speak up for me.

31:52.583 --> 31:54.217
(chuckles)

31:54.218 --> 31:56.044
Leo, what on Earth
are you talking about?

31:56.045 --> 31:58.032
Well, they obviously suspect her.

31:58.033 --> 31:59.538
Of what?

31:59.539 --> 32:02.615
Decoding my poetry,
reporting it to the Kremlin?

32:02.616 --> 32:04.764
I'm not saying it's true,
I'm simply saying

32:04.765 --> 32:06.302
it's a question they would ask.

32:06.303 --> 32:09.957
Why would such
a beautiful young woman...

32:09.958 --> 32:11.495
Ever pay attention

32:11.496 --> 32:14.157
to a disheveled old fool like me?

32:19.446 --> 32:21.143
Albert, I-I didn't mean to...

32:21.144 --> 32:22.811
It's all right, Leo.

32:22.812 --> 32:25.502
I just let my imagination
run away from me.

32:25.503 --> 32:26.914
I'm sure she cares for you very much.

32:26.915 --> 32:28.262
Yes.

32:29.767 --> 32:31.819
I'm sure she does.

32:39.865 --> 32:41.885
(whooshing, gurgling)

32:46.309 --> 32:47.621
Air must have leaked in somehow.

32:47.622 --> 32:49.737
It's ignited the uranium powder.

32:49.738 --> 32:51.629
We must cool it. More water over here!

32:51.630 --> 32:53.681
No, it's too late.
The pile's lost stability.

32:53.682 --> 32:56.149
Everybody out! Now!

32:56.150 --> 32:58.073
Go, go!

32:58.074 --> 32:59.581
Now!

33:02.529 --> 33:04.163
LENARD: <i>So you have achieved</i>

33:04.164 --> 33:05.734
atomic detonation?

33:05.735 --> 33:07.946
It was not the atomic material
itself that exploded.

33:07.947 --> 33:10.672
It was the pressure from the
steam that burst the container.

33:16.505 --> 33:19.165
Your work has progressed
quite slowly, Werner.

33:19.166 --> 33:21.057
And now you have managed

33:21.058 --> 33:23.493
to destroy a very expensive laboratory.

33:23.494 --> 33:25.228
One could arrive at the
conclusion that your heart

33:25.229 --> 33:27.504
and mind are not fully
committed to this undertaking.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.076
That is not true, sir.

33:29.077 --> 33:30.871
I am ambitious
to make a stable reactor.

33:30.872 --> 33:33.467
The Fuhrer does not care
about a reactor!

33:33.468 --> 33:36.961
Your priority must be a weapon.

33:43.342 --> 33:46.769
Constructing a weapon is an
extremely difficult process.

33:46.770 --> 33:50.169
If you are not capable,
I will find a man who is.

33:54.411 --> 33:56.463
I can do this, Mr. Halliwell.

33:57.968 --> 33:59.891
I don't doubt your qualifications.

33:59.892 --> 34:03.095
What I don't understand is why.

34:03.096 --> 34:05.931
I'm too old to join the army.

34:07.681 --> 34:09.605
(clears throat)

34:09.606 --> 34:11.754
If we do take you on, well...

34:11.978 --> 34:13.585
let's just say you might be asked

34:13.587 --> 34:16.438
to do things that you find, uh...

34:16.438 --> 34:17.530
unsavory.

34:20.703 --> 34:22.625
However I can contribute, sir.

34:22.626 --> 34:24.869
This isn't a game, Moe.

34:24.870 --> 34:26.246
Mr. Halliwell,

34:26.248 --> 34:28.074
I'm a grown man who has spent his life

34:28.076 --> 34:29.902
trying to hit a ball with a stick.

34:29.902 --> 34:32.275
I'm tired of playing games.

34:32.275 --> 34:35.417
(indistinct conversations)

34:39.136 --> 34:41.219
Dr. Einstein?

34:42.085 --> 34:43.302
Yes?

34:43.303 --> 34:44.840
Vannevar Bush,

34:44.841 --> 34:46.838
Director of the National
Defense Research Council.

34:46.839 --> 34:50.079
We were hoping you could help
us with some calculations.

35:02.414 --> 35:04.625
You're trying to force uranium isotopes

35:04.626 --> 35:07.029
into a gaseous state.

35:07.030 --> 35:09.531
If we don't show some results
soon, our funding may dry up.

35:11.358 --> 35:13.281
I'm sorry, but I'm quite busy.

35:13.282 --> 35:16.068
They're only a few equations,
Professor.

35:16.069 --> 35:17.480
Then again, just one of my equations

35:17.481 --> 35:20.046
seems to have started all this madness.

The journals say that it will
become a source of energy

38:43.270 --> 38:45.641

38:45.642 --> 38:47.564
That is certainly our hope.

I have also read

38:49.393 --> 38:52.724

38:52.725 --> 38:54.487
Is this true?

38:54.488 --> 38:56.891
A weapon is only theoretical.

38:56.892 --> 38:59.007
Yes, but, theoretically,

38:59.008 --> 39:01.379
if you had the materials,

39:01.380 --> 39:03.496
could it be done?

atomic fission for you, Herr Ritter.

39:17.024 --> 39:19.330
If you were a real physicist,

39:19.331 --> 39:22.536
one who knew how to
build such a weapon,

39:22.537 --> 39:25.070
and you knew it would help
your country win a war...

39:27.217 --> 39:30.135
...but that it could also
kill thousands...

39:32.987 --> 39:35.551
...what do you suppose
would be stronger...

39:35.552 --> 39:37.890
your patriotism...

39:37.891 --> 39:40.521
or your moral qualms?

39:42.669 --> 39:45.617
I suppose...

39:45.618 --> 39:47.989
if I were

39:47.990 --> 39:51.418
a true patriot...

39:51.419 --> 39:54.146
I would have
to push those qualms aside.

39:58.729 --> 40:01.101
Would you really?

40:07.736 --> 40:10.074
Tell me, uh...

40:10.075 --> 40:12.481
do you know my uncertainty principle?

40:13.507 --> 40:15.429
Of course.

40:15.430 --> 40:17.866
Uh, the... the more precisely

40:17.867 --> 40:19.852
you measure a particle's velocity,

40:19.853 --> 40:22.739
