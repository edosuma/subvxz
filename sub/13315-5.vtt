00:04.738 --> 00:09.641
There's no flavor like
new orleans flavor.

00:09.643 --> 00:12.177
Look at this bridge, bro.
How cool is this?

00:12.179 --> 00:14.146
Yeah!

00:15.648 --> 00:18.684
- Hello, <i>mon chéri. </i>
<i>- That just happened.</i>

00:18.686 --> 00:22.454
- Caramel!
- Curves!

00:22.456 --> 00:25.090
- Welcome to
new orleans, norman.
- Whoo.

00:57.690 --> 01:00.259
Reedus:
<i>Give me a plane ticket</i>
<i>to anywhere in the world</i>

01:00.261 --> 01:03.662
<i>And this is where</i>
<i>I'd want to go.</i>

01:03.664 --> 01:05.397
<i>A couple of years ago</i>
<i>I was the grand marshal</i>

01:05.399 --> 01:07.800
<i>Of the endymion parade</i>
<i>at mardi gras.</i>

01:07.802 --> 01:11.703
<i>Since then I've jumped</i>
<i>at every chance I get to come</i>
<i>back to louisiana.</i>

01:11.705 --> 01:14.239
<i>The mash-up of people</i>
<i>and cultures,</i>

01:14.241 --> 01:17.609
<i>The contrast</i>
<i>between rich and poor,</i>
<i>christians and pagans,</i>

01:17.611 --> 01:21.847
<i>Storm survivors and,</i>
<i>let's be honest, partygoers.</i>

01:21.849 --> 01:25.217
<i>Louisiana's a great</i>
<i>american enigma.</i>

01:25.219 --> 01:27.719
It's a crossroads where you can
<i>feel the friction in the air,</i>

01:27.721 --> 01:30.089
<i>And for me</i>
<i>that's pretty cool.</i>

01:30.723 --> 01:34.726
<i>And although my day job</i>
<i>has led me back here</i>
<i>once or twice,</i>

01:34.728 --> 01:38.230
<i>I've never really gotten</i>
<i>the opportunity to explore it.</i>

01:40.567 --> 01:43.335
<i>I'm back and this time</i>
<i>I'm gonna do it right.</i>

01:43.337 --> 01:46.138
<i>I'm taking a three-day trip</i>
<i>on two wheels.</i>

01:56.816 --> 01:59.251
<i>I'm starting in lafayette</i>
<i>and then heading east</i>

01:59.253 --> 02:02.221
<i>Over the atchafalaya basin</i>
<i>into baton rouge.</i>

02:02.223 --> 02:04.289
<i>Following the great</i>
<i>river road south</i>

02:04.291 --> 02:06.892
<i>Along the mississippi,</i>
<i>I'm ending up in the big easy,</i>

02:06.894 --> 02:08.627
<i>New orleans.</i>

02:12.632 --> 02:15.367
<i>I'm bringing brent hinds</i>
<i>of the band mastodon.</i>

02:15.369 --> 02:17.703
<i>We met backstage</i>
<i>at a concert in atlanta</i>

02:17.705 --> 02:20.506
<i>And bonded over music</i>
<i>and bikes, people we both knew,</i>

02:20.508 --> 02:22.574
<i>And our shared love</i>
<i>of louisiana.</i>

02:24.477 --> 02:26.145
- Brent: <i>Yeah. </i>
<i>- Reedus:</i> <i>We're gonna hook up</i>

02:26.147 --> 02:27.546
<i>At a little</i>
<i>hole-in-the-wall taco joint</i>

02:27.548 --> 02:29.615
<i>Brent found while on tour.</i>

02:29.617 --> 02:31.817
- How you been, man?
- I've been all right.

02:31.819 --> 02:35.487
Reedus:
<i>Brent hinds has been playing</i>
<i>guitar for 15 years.</i>

02:35.489 --> 02:38.257
<i>He scored three grammy</i>
<i>nominations along the way.</i>

02:38.259 --> 02:41.160
<i>But he's still</i>
<i>a country boy at heart.</i>

02:41.162 --> 02:44.630
<i>He first came to new orleans</i>
<i>hopping trains as a kid</i>
<i>from alabama.</i>

02:46.599 --> 02:48.667
- Welcome to taco sisters.
- Oh, thanks.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.502
What should I order?
What's your specialty?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.838
We have the wake
and bake burrito.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.540
Oh, now we're talking.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.341
I'll take that
without the burrito.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.512
Woman:
<i>Two coffees up for norman.</i>

03:00.514 --> 03:04.383
And your paula special
and wake and bake.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.552
You used to come here
as a kid like how often?

03:06.554 --> 03:10.889
We came here a couple times
and got bit up by mosquitoes
pretty good.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.958
And then we went back
to alabama and got bit up
by some more mosquitoes.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.793
Do they got that
zika virus here?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.461
They don't have it yet,
but we'll get it.

03:21.267 --> 03:22.868
- Is that slammin'?
- So good, yeah.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.703
They put marijuana
in there?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.838
They might, I don't know.
It's really delicious.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.475
How'd you get started
riding motorcycles and stuff?

03:30.477 --> 03:32.678
Being from alabama, man.
You know?

03:32.680 --> 03:35.948
I mean, you're born with
a gun and a motorcycle
in my neighborhood.

03:35.950 --> 03:39.985
My dad, he reared us
on motorcycles and guns
and hunting

03:39.987 --> 03:43.555
And he was teaching
three and five-year-olds
how to be a man

03:43.557 --> 03:47.426
- Before you even know what
a pacifier is, you know.
- Right, right.

03:47.428 --> 03:50.796
- I love the outdoors.
I love hunting and fishing.
- Oh, wow.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.598
Why go to the grocery store
when you can go to the woods?

03:54.602 --> 03:56.301
Do you know
new orleans very well?

03:56.303 --> 03:58.337
I do.
I played there a lot

03:58.339 --> 04:00.272
And I hopped
freight trains
there a lot.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.307
Last Halloween we played
the voodoo festival,

04:02.309 --> 04:03.775
But it rained
like a son of a bitch.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.477
First time I came out
here, I was in a movie.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.346
And then I came
back here last year.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.880
I was the grand marshal

04:08.882 --> 04:10.616
Of the endymion parade
at mardi gras.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.551
- Wow.
- <i>Yeah, I like new orleans.</i>

04:12.553 --> 04:13.986
<i>And you got</i>
<i>a friend that does</i>
<i>tattoos and stuff, right?</i>

04:13.988 --> 04:15.721
Yeah, we're gonna
go see jordan

04:15.723 --> 04:17.789
And I'm thinking about
getting me a lemmy tattoo

04:17.791 --> 04:20.692
Because he was kind
of a mentor of mine
and he was an old friend

04:20.694 --> 04:23.695
And we played a lot
of concerts together
and, you know?

04:23.697 --> 04:25.564
Let's go.
Let's hit it.
Yeah, man.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.399
- This burrito was delicious.
- I'm ready when you are.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.768
- I got to tell you.
- Yeah, I want to thank
both sisters.

04:33.039 --> 04:34.906
- Let's get matching tattoos.
- All right. All right.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.042
- Motorhead.
- Yeah, right?

04:37.044 --> 04:39.645
Matching bro tattoos.
There's nothing cooler
than that.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.013
All right, cool.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.483
Yeah, man.

04:47.053 --> 04:49.955
Reedus:
Wow, this is like crawfish
country right here.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.990
Hinds:
Hell, yeah.
It's beautiful out here.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.960
Reedus:
<i>Louisiana is the crawfishing</i>
<i>capital of the world,</i>

04:54.962 --> 04:56.862
<i>Harvesting over</i>
<i>100 million pounds</i>

04:56.864 --> 04:58.864
<i>Of those spiny little</i>
<i>creatures each year.</i>

04:58.866 --> 05:01.366
<i>So it's like brent said,</i>
<i>why go to the store</i>

05:01.368 --> 05:03.068
<i>When you can go</i>
<i>to the swamp?</i>

05:03.070 --> 05:05.003
Reedus:
<i>Look how nice</i>
<i>it is out here.</i>

05:05.005 --> 05:08.006
-  <i>It's got that "sleepy</i>
<i> hollow" vibe. </i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

05:08.008 --> 05:11.410
Dude, look at these
crazy old creepy trees
and stuff right here.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.645
Hinds:
<i>Don't look at that tree, man,</i>
<i>or you'll get possessed by it</i>

05:13.647 --> 05:15.647
- <i>For the rest of your life. </i>

05:15.649 --> 05:16.915
Reedus:
<i>Brent and I</i>
<i>are making the trip</i>

05:16.917 --> 05:18.950
<i>On a pair</i>
<i>of triumph tigers.</i>

05:18.952 --> 05:21.687
<i>The 800 series</i>
<i>boasts an awesome</i>
<i>double punch of power</i>

05:21.689 --> 05:23.855
<i>And torque spread.</i>

05:23.857 --> 05:28.694
<i>And my custom xcx</i>
<i>has a high-end adjustable</i>
<i>wp suspension</i>

05:28.696 --> 05:31.630
<i>And a sophisticated</i>
<i>electronic system.</i>

05:33.866 --> 05:35.701
I like the sound of these.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.969
It's like a turbine.
Like "zzzz."

05:37.971 --> 05:41.540
I just found out that my bike
tells me what gear I'm in.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.509
- Yeah.
- I'm a slow learner.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.647
Reedus:
<i>This bayou goes way back.</i>

05:48.649 --> 05:50.482
<i>In the 1700s there were</i>
<i>these canadians</i>

05:50.484 --> 05:51.750
<i>That got fed up</i>
<i>with the british</i>

05:51.752 --> 05:53.952
<i>Who ruled</i>
<i>with an iron fist.</i>

05:53.954 --> 05:57.622
<i>Somehow they made it</i>
<i>all the way down here</i>
<i>1,200 miles away.</i>

05:57.624 --> 06:00.792
- We in the bayou.
- Yeah, baby.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.994
Reedus:
<i>Fishermen by nature,</i>
<i>they turned crawfish</i>

06:02.996 --> 06:05.464
<i>Into the louisiana staple</i>
<i>it is today.</i>

06:05.466 --> 06:08.033
<i>And ever since,</i>
<i>generations of cajuns</i>

06:08.035 --> 06:09.534
<i>Have been pulling bounty</i>
<i>from the swamp.</i>

06:14.006 --> 06:16.475
<i>And of all the crawfishermen</i>
<i>in louisiana,</i>

06:16.477 --> 06:18.877
<i>There's one who towers</i>
<i>above the rest.</i>

06:18.879 --> 06:20.779
<i>A true legend.</i>
<i>Mike clay.</i>

06:20.781 --> 06:22.647
- How are you, sir?
-  <i>Good, how y'all doing?</i>

06:22.649 --> 06:24.116
<i>Good, man, good.</i>

06:24.118 --> 06:26.885
Reedus:
<i>The 2013 breaux bridge</i>
<i>crawfish king,</i>

06:26.887 --> 06:29.454
<i>Mike opens up his breeding</i>
<i>pond to teach others</i>

06:29.456 --> 06:31.423
<i>About the cajun tradition</i>
<i>of crawfishing.</i>

06:31.425 --> 06:32.958
<i>And they keep it simple--</i>

06:32.960 --> 06:35.026
<i>Boil them up with</i>
<i>your favorite spice blend,</i>

06:35.028 --> 06:37.162
<i>Grab a fistful,</i>
<i>and chow down.</i>

06:37.164 --> 06:39.731
How hard is it
to catch crawfish?
I've never done this before.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.633
- It's easy, believe me.
-  <i>Is it easy?</i>

06:41.635 --> 06:44.569
We have some nets over here.
We got some bait already
worked up.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.471
Reedus:
<i>How long have you guys</i>
<i>been out here doing this?</i>

06:46.473 --> 06:48.073
I've been doing this
since I was 13 years old.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.509
Oh, so you definitely
know what you're doing.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.577
So you put the fish
on the things and you
just drop 'em in the water?

06:52.579 --> 06:54.413
That's it.
Piece of cake, right?

06:54.415 --> 06:55.781
So there's just
billions of them on
the ground right now?

06:55.783 --> 06:58.750
Billions of them.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.752
Ooh, look at that.
Look at that crawfish
right there.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.054
Look at that.
Look at that big-ass craw.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.191
That's a big one, boy.
Man, that's delicious
eating right there.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.126
- Put your finger in there.
- No way.

07:08.128 --> 07:11.563
Ow! Mother
ow! !!

07:20.072 --> 07:21.640
Whole lot of crawfish.

07:25.578 --> 07:28.713
That went in the real
pants right there.

07:28.715 --> 07:32.551
That was-- yeah.
I'm gonna stink for
the next couple of days.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.785
I'm gonna smell so bad.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.223
Little wet butt going
on right now.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.559
Dude, this is so gross.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.227
What do you
do with this?

07:42.229 --> 07:45.163
Just scoop it in the water
and you might catch something.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.898
Really?

07:58.678 --> 08:00.178
Man:
<i>Look, we got</i>
<i>another net for you.</i>

08:00.180 --> 08:02.147
There you go.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.183
That happens
a lot, though, right?
Not just me?

08:10.924 --> 08:12.991
That's two I broke now.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.760
<i>Two nets I broke</i>
<i>already, yeah.</i>

08:17.063 --> 08:18.630
Pull it fast.
Pull it fast.

08:18.632 --> 08:21.933
Hoo-yah!
Aii!

08:21.935 --> 08:23.969
- Is he dead?
- Yeah, he's dead.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.104
No, he's still alive.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.106
- He's moving.
He just gives up.
- He's just relaxing.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.108
- He just gave up.
- He just norman from
"walking dead."

08:30.110 --> 08:32.143
He just fainted.

08:32.145 --> 08:35.280
Crawfish can't handle
celebrities catching them,
you know?

08:35.282 --> 08:38.884
You know, this pond
right here

08:38.886 --> 08:41.620
<i>Has produced the world's</i>
<i>fastest crawfish.</i>

08:41.622 --> 08:42.821
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

08:42.823 --> 08:43.855
- Do you guys race 'em?
- Oh, yeah.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.023
You put them in a round thing

08:45.025 --> 08:46.758
And see who gets
to the edge first?

08:46.760 --> 08:47.959
- <i>Yes, sir. </i>
<i>- Yeah, yeah, that's cool.</i>

08:47.961 --> 08:49.928
How do you pick
a fast crawfish?

08:49.930 --> 08:51.930
Well, that's a secret
between me and my two sons.

08:51.932 --> 08:55.767
Oh. It's how fast
they move their tail.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.936
I'm a natural.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.108
Come on, baby,
you can do it.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.011
- You ready?
- Come on, baby.
I got faith, baby.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.079
- Okay, $10 bet on it.
- 10 bucks.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.249
- Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

09:11.251 --> 09:13.618
- Run,  run!
- Eat this guy!

09:13.620 --> 09:16.087
- Get him!
Come on, man!
- Come on, come on!

09:16.089 --> 09:17.923
Come on!
No, no, no, no!

09:17.925 --> 09:20.058
I crossed the line.
I crossed the line.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.761
Yeah, 10 bucks.
10 bucks.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.864
You've earned your freedom.
Victory.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.966
Now let's eat
all their friends.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.669
- Man: <i>Put 'em</i>
<i> in that basket. </i>
<i>- Reedus:</i> <i>Whoa!</i>

09:30.671 --> 09:33.071
You got to catch 'em by hand
and just pull 'em up and put
'em in the basket.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.074
- <i>Get on the side. </i>
<i>- Ai-yi-yi-yi!</i>

09:36.076 --> 09:38.209
Ayi!

09:38.211 --> 09:40.278
Why don't we just pick
this up and dump them
in there?

09:40.280 --> 09:42.080
You want to
dump them in there?
That'd be easier for you?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.315
That seems like
it's smarter, right?

09:43.317 --> 09:45.183
Okay, that's smarter
for you, huh?

09:45.185 --> 09:48.753
- There you go.
- Know what I mean?
Efficient.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.891
This side in first.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.360
Wow, that's hot.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.996
- Oh, look at that.
I got one.
- That was a good one.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.799
There's no shortage
of these things out here.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.068
How do you avoid
butt juice?

10:03.070 --> 10:06.071
- You just eat it.
- It's all good.

10:06.073 --> 10:09.174
Reedus:
<i>Life on the bayou goes back</i>
<i>to simpler times</i>

10:09.176 --> 10:10.775
<i>When people were happy</i>
<i>to live off the land</i>

10:10.777 --> 10:12.344
<i>And off the grid.</i>

10:12.346 --> 10:14.746
<i>And despite the modern world's</i>
<i>best efforts,</i>

10:14.748 --> 10:18.016
<i>In a lot of ways out here,</i>
<i>not a whole lot has changed.</i>

10:18.018 --> 10:20.385
<i>For mike and his crew,</i>
<i>there's clearly pride</i>

10:20.387 --> 10:23.688
<i>In keeping the time-honored</i>
<i>traditions of their cajun</i>
<i>ancestors alive.</i>

10:27.227 --> 10:29.027
<i>And there's no better way</i>
<i>to make a living.</i>

10:29.029 --> 10:31.196
Thank you so much, sir.
That was awesome.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.098
- A pleasure.
- You enjoyed it?

10:33.100 --> 10:34.899
Absolutely.
It was a pleasure, bro.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.401
Reedus:
<i>Being down here reminds</i>
<i>me of that scene</i>

10:36.403 --> 10:38.970
<i>In "one flew over</i>

10:42.376 --> 10:44.275
<i>Don't be a fisherman,</i>
<i>be a fisher of men.</i>

10:44.277 --> 10:46.878
<i>Or something like that.</i>

10:46.880 --> 10:49.414
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>it's not about what you haul</i>
<i>in at the end of the day.</i>

10:49.416 --> 10:52.417
<i>What matters is</i>
<i>the people you get to know</i>
<i>on your journey.</i>

10:52.419 --> 10:54.119
<i>The connections you make.</i>

10:56.022 --> 10:58.189
<i>There's just one thing</i>
<i>I'd like to add.</i>

10:58.191 --> 11:00.959
<i>The journey is always</i>
<i>better on a motorcycle.</i>

11:07.834 --> 11:09.134
Wow.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.436
Yeah!

11:23.049 --> 11:25.917
- This is a really cool
area out here.
- Yeah.

11:25.919 --> 11:29.120

11:30.891 --> 11:34.426
Yeah, man.
That's what I love
about louisiana.

11:34.428 --> 11:37.062
Reedus:
<i>Riding in southern louisiana,</i>

11:37.064 --> 11:40.465
<i>It's not long before you</i>
<i>realize why they call this</i>
<i>place the bayou state.</i>

11:40.467 --> 11:43.068
<i>This area is known</i>
<i>as the atchafalaya basin</i>

11:43.070 --> 11:46.004
<i>And it's the only</i>
<i>louisiana basin that has</i>
<i>a growing delta.</i>

11:51.077 --> 11:54.145
Narrator:
<i>Down where louisiana</i>
<i>is neither land nor sea,</i>

11:54.147 --> 11:56.448
<i>The bayou echoes through</i>
<i>the louisiana swamps.</i>

11:56.450 --> 11:59.150
<i>At the fishing grounds,</i>
<i>the weighted nets are</i>
<i>tossed overboard</i>

11:59.152 --> 12:00.952

<i>Get a load of this and watch</i>
<i>your step there, fella.</i>

12:03.290 --> 12:07.025
<i>Of course it's work,</i>
<i>but the result is quite</i>
<i>a pile of fish.</i>

12:07.027 --> 12:09.160
Reedus:
<i>You know, the last time</i>
<i>I was down here,</i>

12:09.162 --> 12:11.830
<i>I did a photo shoot</i>
<i>on an airboat.</i>

12:12.898 --> 12:16.434
<i>We covered a lot of ground,</i>
<i>but it just left me</i>
<i>wanting more.</i>

12:18.838 --> 12:21.506

- I don't know.
- What do you mean
you don't know?

<i>This place is awesome.</i>
<i>Looks like "texas chainsaw</i>

There's a whole easter bunny
theme going on here as well.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.407
- That's not creepy at all.

12:56.409 --> 12:59.177
- How y'all doing?
What you guys up to?
- How are you, man?

12:59.179 --> 13:01.212
- Can you take us
on an airboat?
- Sure can.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.982

Cherie is about
a 14-year-old alligator.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.164
I found her
a few years ago.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.032
She had run into
a thorn tree.

14:28.034 --> 14:31.402
She ended up

That's the only
reason she kiss me,
she's blind.

When did you first,

call the alligator over?

14:44.584 --> 14:46.517
Tucker:
<i>Well, when we were kids,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

14:46.519 --> 14:50.488
Back in the early '60s,
alligators were put on
the endangered species list.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.657
There were very few
of them left.

14:52.659 --> 14:56.327
And when we saw an alligator,
we were so intrigued with it,
you know?

14:56.329 --> 14:58.263
They have very
long-term memory.

14:58.265 --> 15:02.267
I've had alligators
that I've made friends with

15:02.269 --> 15:04.335
And don't see them
for six, seven years

15:04.337 --> 15:06.537
And they'll show
themselves up again

15:06.539 --> 15:08.973
And it's just like we never
missed a day, you know?

15:08.975 --> 15:10.275
- Really?
- Wow.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.410
Dude, you just called
an alligator over here.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.978

- Just looking at your controls.

- All right, 19.

19:30.769 --> 19:33.571
You can't touch your money
once you place the bet.

- Just hit him with a stick.
- I'm gonna hit him in a minute.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.675

<i>What brent's talking about</i>
<i>is lemmy from motorhead.</i>

20:22.422 --> 20:24.288
<i>His friend is a really</i>
<i>good tattoo artist</i>

20:24.290 --> 20:25.990
<i>And we're hoping to go get</i>
<i>a little tribute thing.</i>

20:25.992 --> 20:27.825
<i>It's only a 90-minute ride</i>
<i>from here.</i>

20:27.827 --> 20:29.694
Hey, man, you still
got to pee?

20:29.696 --> 20:31.529
Yeah, I still
got to pee.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.397
I got to stretch
my legs, too.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.666
Hey, man, I've heard
of this place before.
Middendorf's.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.735
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.904
Look at that bike.

20:39.906 --> 20:43.007
Yeah, it looks amazing.
I got to go pee.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.508
- Is this your bike?
- Yeah, man.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.577
- What is that?
- Matt. How are you?

20:46.579 --> 20:49.513
Yeah, that's an old
suzuki savage 650
converted to electric.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.715
- You did all this yourself?
- I did, yeah.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.750
Does it make
any noise at all?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.885
It makes a little noise
when you're coming
off the line.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.721
And once you get to speed,
it's pretty silent.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.990
These are actually out
of a nissan leaf.

20:58.992 --> 21:00.891
- <i>But these cells are amazing. </i>
<i>- Did you turn this thing</i>
<i>  on yet?</i>

21:00.893 --> 21:02.493
- It's on. It's on.
- It's on right now?

21:02.495 --> 21:04.762
- You want to ride it?
- You should ride it.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.964
- Can I ride it?
- It's the trippiest thing
you've ever felt.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.767
It's kind of like
a magic carpet ride.
You just get on and it floats.

21:09.769 --> 21:13.371
- Wow.
- <i>The cool thing is I can plug</i>
<i> my laptop into it</i>

21:13.373 --> 21:16.607
<i>And, like, adjust</i>
<i>the throttle torque curve</i>
<i>however I want.</i>

21:16.609 --> 21:19.644
Did you get into this
to be environmentally
correct or...

21:19.646 --> 21:22.513
I mean, it's a nice bonus,
but I was looking for a bike

21:22.515 --> 21:25.316
When we moved to new orleans
and I saw this guy online.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.551
He was selling a kit.
That's how I kind of
got into it.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.954
- And I'm just totally hooked.
- Wow.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.889
- Crazy, right?
-        - Holy.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.392
<i>This is mind-blowingly</i>
<i>innovative</i>

21:34.394 --> 21:36.927
And just robot as hell.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.797
One, two,
one, two, three, four.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.700
- Cool.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, man.

21:42.702 --> 21:46.537
Nice to meet you, too.
Have a safe trip
to new orleans.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.907
Hinds: <i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>We'll drive as fast</i>
<i>as we can.</i>

21:55.814 --> 21:57.548
Yeah!

22:02.054 --> 22:03.921
We coming into
new orleans now, baby.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.390
- You guys are doing it sleazy?
- Yeah, we love the sleazy.

22:06.392 --> 22:09.393
- Something like this
would look pretty cool.
- Yeah, perfect.

22:09.395 --> 22:11.862
Dang.
I think I'm in love.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.734
- Are we even close       to the downtown?
-  I don't       know where the.

22:16.736 --> 22:19.470
We're about 15 miles out.
Yeah, man, we're close.
Trust me.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.539
Reedus:
<i>We're on our way to one of my</i>
<i>favorite cities in the world.</i>

22:24.609 --> 22:27.345
Oh, we coming into
new orleans now, baby.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.513
Reedus:
<i>From baton rouge,</i>
<i>it's a 95-mile ride</i>

22:29.515 --> 22:33.117
Southeast along the great river
<i>road to the crescent city,</i>

22:33.119 --> 22:36.120
<i>The big easy,</i>
<i>new orleans.</i>

22:36.122 --> 22:39.557
<i>"king city" playing</i>

22:39.559 --> 22:41.359
- Are we here?
- Yes, sir.

22:41.361 --> 22:44.028
<i>♪ you are now home </i>

22:44.030 --> 22:47.765
<i>♪ in the city of kings </i>

22:47.767 --> 22:51.102
<i>♪ come with me </i>

22:51.104 --> 22:53.504
<i>♪ come to the city </i>

22:53.506 --> 22:57.742
<i>♪ your king</i>
<i>has finally come... ♪</i>

22:57.744 --> 22:59.744
Reedus:
<i>One of the oldest</i>
<i>cities in america,</i>

22:59.746 --> 23:02.446
<i>New orleans has always</i>
<i>done its own thing.</i>

23:02.448 --> 23:04.982
<i>But I'd expect</i>
<i>nothing less from a city</i>
<i>that got its nickname</i>

23:04.984 --> 23:08.386
<i>From turning into a big</i>
<i>speakeasy during prohibition.</i>

23:08.388 --> 23:10.621
Hinds:
<i>This is awesome.</i>
<i>Welcome to new orleans, norman.</i>

23:10.623 --> 23:13.524
- Reedus: Whoo!
- Ayi!

23:13.526 --> 23:14.925
I'm excited to see
my buddy jordan.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.461
Yeah, I'm excited
to meet him, man.

23:17.463 --> 23:20.865
Reedus:
<i>First stop in town,</i>
<i>abracadabra tattoos.</i>

23:20.867 --> 23:23.033
- Yo, jordi.
- <i>I thought I smelled</i>
<i> something sexy.</i>

23:23.035 --> 23:24.802
What's going on?

23:24.804 --> 23:26.804
We rode some
motorcycles over here,
me and my friend norman.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.706
- Jordan.
- Nice to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.674
- What's up? Cornbread.
- Nice to meet you, cornbread.

23:30.676 --> 23:33.477
- You guys enjoying the sleazy?
- Yeah, we love the sleazy.

23:33.479 --> 23:36.414
- So we want to get
lemmy tattoos.
- Awesome.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.048
Reedus:
<i>Since the early 2000s,</i>

23:38.050 --> 23:39.950
<i>Jordan barlow</i>
<i>has been turning out</i>

23:39.952 --> 23:41.986
<i>Some of the most creative</i>
<i>artwork in all new orleans.</i>

23:41.988 --> 23:44.422
<i>He opened his own place</i>
<i>two years back</i>

23:44.424 --> 23:47.691
<i>And already</i>
<i>it's one of the most</i>
<i>respected shops in town.</i>

23:47.693 --> 23:49.860
Good seeing you, dude.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.796
Reedus:
<i>Brent and him,</i>
<i>they go way back.</i>

23:51.798 --> 23:54.565
They met hoboing freight trains
and have been tight ever since.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.834
How'd you get that
skeleton so small?

23:56.836 --> 23:58.969
Jordan:
<i>I went to fiji,</i>
<i>had them shrink it down.</i>

23:58.971 --> 24:00.838
<i>You couldn't just have</i>
<i>them shrink it down here</i>
<i>in new orleans?</i>

24:00.840 --> 24:03.174
Voodoo enriched around
here, I've heard.

24:03.176 --> 24:05.009
Reedus:
<i>Place is so cool.</i>

24:05.011 --> 24:07.578
<i>It's like a museum.</i>
<i>Dude, I like the gold ak.</i>

24:07.580 --> 24:09.847
<i>That's the</i>
<i>russian half wood one.</i>
<i>We shoot those on the show.</i>

24:09.849 --> 24:12.983
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah, yeah, it's a blast.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.152
So I was thinking
something like this

24:15.154 --> 24:17.455
Would look pretty cool
in the motorhead font.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.824
I was kind of thinking
more like just super simple.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.959
- Like a kid did it.
- All right.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.929
-  <i>Yeah, like that. Bam. </i>
<i>- All right, let's get</i>
<i>  that shirt off.</i>

24:27.899 --> 24:30.134
<i>So how long's it been</i>
<i>since your last tattoo?</i>

24:30.136 --> 24:32.736
- <i>It's been a long time. </i>
<i>- Yeah? What was</i>
<i>  your first one?</i>

24:32.738 --> 24:34.572
I was 12 or 13

24:34.574 --> 24:36.740
And I kept bringing
this guy money.

24:36.742 --> 24:40.578
He'd always kick us out.
We came in there with
a big wad of money

24:40.580 --> 24:43.781
- And he goes,    "get in.
- "  - make sure nobody was looking?

24:43.783 --> 24:45.883
<i>Yeah, and he gave me</i>
<i>this little lizard</i>
<i>on my leg.</i>

24:45.885 --> 24:47.852
And we were like, "yeah!"

24:47.854 --> 24:49.753
I mean,
they're like the worst
tattoos in the world.

24:49.755 --> 24:50.788
Cornbread:
<i>All right, you ready </i>
<i>for this one?</i>

24:50.790 --> 24:52.523
Let's do it.

24:52.525 --> 24:54.859
Reedus:
Motorhead and lemmy
specifically

24:54.861 --> 24:56.794
<i>Are kind of one of the voices</i>
<i>of our generation.</i>

24:56.796 --> 24:59.864
<i>Born out of the punk scene</i>
<i>in the 1970s london,</i>

24:59.866 --> 25:03.067
<i>Motorhead is often credited</i>
<i>with the birth of heavy metal.</i>

25:03.069 --> 25:05.836
<i>They're one of mastodon's </i>
<i>main musical inspirations.</i>

25:05.838 --> 25:08.772
<i>Lemmy is kind of a hero</i>
<i>to both of us.</i>

25:08.774 --> 25:11.976
I made it look just like
a hand poked tattoo for you.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.513
- Yeah, perfect.
- <i>Is that the one?</i>

25:15.515 --> 25:17.515
Yeah, that's perfect.
Thank you, man.

25:17.517 --> 25:20.017
Yeah, thanks, dude.
Cool.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.286
- Let me see it.
- Two seconds, man.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.288
Why'd you get it
so tiny, man?

25:24.290 --> 25:27.725
Oh, you had to do it
because of the vest, right?

25:27.727 --> 25:30.528
- Reedus: <i>Dude,</i>
<i> that looks awesome. </i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

25:30.530 --> 25:31.962
Perfect spot for it, too.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.064
Dude, we got lemmy
memorial tattoos now.

25:34.066 --> 25:36.734
- Done.
- Done, boom.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.318
Reedus:
<i>This city has been ravaged</i>
<i>by fires and hurricanes.</i>

25:54.320 --> 25:58.088
<i>But the waters,</i>
<i>they only rise for so long</i>

25:58.090 --> 26:00.758
<i>And new orleans</i>
<i>never stops.</i>

26:02.761 --> 26:06.263
<i>And if you wander around</i>
<i>new orleans long enough,</i>

26:06.265 --> 26:09.099
<i>You're bound to run</i>
<i>into voodoo.</i>

26:09.101 --> 26:13.003
<i>It's one of the most</i>
<i>misunderstood religions</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

26:13.005 --> 26:15.906
And it's run through this place
<i>straight from the beginning.</i>

26:19.778 --> 26:21.245
- You nervous?
- Yeah.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.781
- You should be.
- Great, thank you very much.

26:23.783 --> 26:27.117
I'm just kidding.
We're going to pay our
traditional respects.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.320
- Make things right.
- All positive, right?

26:29.322 --> 26:30.788
- All positive. White magic.
- Sun's gonna come out.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.590
We're gonna get back
on the bikes.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.792
- Here we go. Hi. Hi.
- Sallie: <i>Hey, how you doing?</i>

26:34.794 --> 26:36.260
- <i>I'm norman. </i>
<i>-</i> <i>I'm sallie.</i>

26:36.262 --> 26:38.262
- Nice to meet you, sallie.
- Nice to meet you.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.797
- Hi, sallie. How are you?
My name's brent.
- Brent?

26:39.799 --> 26:41.599
- Nice to meet you.

26:41.601 --> 26:44.301
- Who do I hear over here?
- That's ayida the akita.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.103
Reedus:
<i>Sallie ann glassman</i>

26:46.105 --> 26:48.272
<i>Isn't your typical</i>
<i>voodoo high priestess.</i>

26:48.274 --> 26:51.075
<i>She's been practicing here</i>
<i>since 1977</i>

26:51.077 --> 26:53.844
<i>And she's only one</i>
<i>of a handful of americans</i>

26:53.846 --> 26:57.114
<i>Who have ever been ordained</i>
<i>in the traditional haitian</i>
<i>initiation ceremony.</i>

26:57.116 --> 26:59.883
Every time
I'm in new orleans,
I can feel it.

26:59.885 --> 27:02.152
Glassman:
<i>Oh, new orleans is full</i>
<i>of spirits.</i>

27:02.154 --> 27:03.754
- <i>Oh, I can just feel it. </i>
<i>-</i> <i>And history.</i>

27:03.756 --> 27:05.389
I don't know anything
about it at all.

27:05.391 --> 27:08.359
You say voodoo and everybody
thinks zombies, right?

27:08.361 --> 27:11.629
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You probably think zombies
even more than most people.

27:11.631 --> 27:16.800
To me, voodoo is not
this dangerous hexing
thing, 'cause it's not.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.702
It's a beautiful religion.

27:18.704 --> 27:20.938
It's all about
raising your own power

27:20.940 --> 27:23.874
And becoming a participant
in your own life.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.676
- I like everything
you're saying so far.
- Good.

27:25.678 --> 27:27.911
- Yeah, that's great.
- This is really affecting me.

27:27.913 --> 27:30.748
- Yeah, you're into this.
I can tell.
- I just constantly feel it.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.950
- Can I hug you real fast?
- Yeah.

27:34.886 --> 27:36.720
- Group hug.
- Amazing. Amazing.

27:38.423 --> 27:41.058
We have a shrine
for marie laveau.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.327
<i>Probably new orleans's </i>
<i>most famous citizen.</i>

27:43.329 --> 27:46.330
<i>150 years after she died,</i>
<i>people still go to her</i>

27:46.332 --> 27:49.333
<i>For empowerment</i>
<i>and guidance and healing.</i>

27:49.335 --> 27:51.669
<i>And I do a little ceremony</i>
<i>for her out there.</i>

27:51.671 --> 27:53.370
- Let's do it, yeah.
- You can see how that feels.

27:53.372 --> 27:56.874
We need to bring
marie's candles.
An offering to her.

27:56.876 --> 28:00.210
- I'm blue.
- I'm reddish purplish.

28:00.212 --> 28:04.281
First we always offer
to the four corners

28:04.283 --> 28:07.351
Of the crossroads.
We orient things.

28:07.353 --> 28:11.689
Everything's done
in threes because two
could be a coincidence,

28:11.691 --> 28:14.324
But three
means you're moving
into intention.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.694
Three drops.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.430
Then kiss the back
of your hand three times.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.980
Stand.

28:41.853 --> 28:43.387
Okay, you did it.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.422
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

28:49.260 --> 28:52.162
Reedus:
<i>You know, coming here,</i>
<i>I didn't know what to expect,</i>

28:52.164 --> 28:55.899
<i>But voodoo, like this city,</i>
<i>it's full of surprises.</i>

28:55.901 --> 28:58.469
Thank you.
Nice meeting you back
there hiding in the shadows.

28:58.471 --> 29:01.739
<i>And I got to see</i>
<i>another side of a guy</i>
<i>I thought I knew really well.</i>

29:04.242 --> 29:05.876
Wow, she was awesome.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.911
She made the weather
clear up

29:07.913 --> 29:09.847
And my mind clear up.

29:16.020 --> 29:19.022
- That's a 'busa 1300.

29:19.024 --> 29:21.425
Smell the rubber.
Smell it.

29:21.427 --> 29:24.361
I definitely don't want
to be a famous actor,
I know that.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.864
I don't think I've ever
seen anything like this.
Thank you so much.

29:28.500 --> 29:32.035
I'm not allowed for life
in the biloxi, mississippi,

29:32.037 --> 29:34.438
Hard rock casino
for the rest of my life.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.874
- What'd you do?
-    - I broke some ,

29:36.876 --> 29:38.509
Then I pissed
in a planter pot.

29:38.511 --> 29:42.045
I was high on jagermeister,
the black out cough syrup.

29:42.047 --> 29:45.816
I was on a beach,
I was, like, 15 drinking
jagermeister.

29:45.818 --> 29:48.051
This lady had
this golden retriever

29:48.053 --> 29:50.387
Sort of licking her in places
in front of a crowd

29:50.389 --> 29:52.022
That was hollering
and I saw it

29:52.024 --> 29:54.558
And I just started puking
purple for like two hours.

29:56.228 --> 30:00.097
One time I drank some
marijuana-laced tequila.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.865
I woke up the next day
and I couldn't see.

30:01.867 --> 30:04.434
I was  blind
for 12 hours straight.

30:04.436 --> 30:07.905
I could open my eyes
just a little bit to cry.

30:07.907 --> 30:10.007
You've been pretty
hard core, man.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.242
Yeah, I've pretty much
done it all, my friend.

30:14.212 --> 30:16.480
Reedus:
<i>When I shot the movie</i>
<i>"tough luck" down here</i>

30:16.482 --> 30:20.083
<i>15 years ago,</i>
<i>everyone kind of looked</i>
<i>at us like we were crazy.</i>

30:20.085 --> 30:23.921
<i>But since then,</i>
<i>new orleans has turned into</i>
<i>hollywood on the delta.</i>

30:23.923 --> 30:26.523
<i>Over 500 films have</i>
<i>been shot down here</i>

30:26.525 --> 30:29.927
<i>Including the epic american</i>
<i>road journey "easy rider."</i>

30:29.929 --> 30:32.930
<i>And just like "easy rider,"</i>
<i>we got things we want</i>
<i>to do, man.</i>

30:32.932 --> 30:35.265
- Hey, you guys open?
- Man: <i>Yes, we are.</i>

30:35.267 --> 30:37.568
- Oh, nice.
This place is awesome.
-  <i>Yeah.</i>

30:37.570 --> 30:41.205
Reedus:
<i>And right now, that thing</i>
<i>is we want to eat.</i>

30:41.207 --> 30:42.472
Boudin.

30:47.145 --> 30:48.979
Oh, my god,
I got to steal this.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.581
- This is too good,
- "be nice or leave."

30:50.583 --> 30:53.150
Two orders of boudin.

30:53.152 --> 30:55.152
<i>So what is this exactly?</i>

30:55.154 --> 30:57.221
- It's kind
of like stuffing...
- <i>Is it sausage?</i>

30:57.223 --> 30:59.256
...That you put
inside of a turkey
at thanksgiving.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.124
- Mmm.
- Yeah, it's amazing, right?

31:01.126 --> 31:03.193
So that lady--
I can't get over
that lady.

31:03.195 --> 31:07.497
I'm feeling so much weight
lifted off of my soul.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.433
You became very emotional
with all of that.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.301
You really--
you're a feeler.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.370
I mean, you listen
to your music and you
see, like--

31:13.372 --> 31:16.073
Like, you're full-on
full raw power.

31:16.075 --> 31:19.543
I'm not a fighter.
I'm a lover and I'm a lifer
for my passion of art.

31:19.545 --> 31:23.180
I feel like it's my goal
in life to figure out

31:23.182 --> 31:25.282
- What the hell
I'm doing here.
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

31:25.284 --> 31:27.217
Mmm.

31:27.219 --> 31:31.255
It's interesting for me
to have a new aspect

31:31.257 --> 31:33.991
Of someone's personality
be shown through a couple
of days on the road.

31:33.993 --> 31:38.362
You'll never find that
part of yourself sitting
in your living room.

31:38.364 --> 31:41.231
Yeah, never.
That's why motorcycles
go well

31:41.233 --> 31:44.167
With this kind
of lifestyle, you know?
It works.

31:44.169 --> 31:48.171
You really do learn
to not sweat the petty stuff

31:48.173 --> 31:50.173
- And pet the sweaty stuff.
- Yeah.

31:50.175 --> 31:52.376
That's my next
t-shirt right there.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.912
- Fried oysters florentine.
- <i>Oh, wow.</i>

31:54.914 --> 31:56.647
- There you go.
- I don't think I've ever
seen anything like this.

31:56.649 --> 31:58.415
- Thank you so much.
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

31:58.417 --> 32:00.317
You said something
about new orleans.

32:00.319 --> 32:03.921
You said it's a place where
a lot of people move to

32:03.923 --> 32:05.422
To be themselves.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.124
-  <i>Mm-hmm. </i>
<i>- And that was so true.</i>

32:07.126 --> 32:09.559
It's a very eclectic
mix of people down here

32:09.561 --> 32:11.228
That you'll find nowhere
else in the world.

32:11.230 --> 32:14.531
Yeah. Oh, my god.
I just ate a lot of food.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.600
This is something
we should have shared,
you know?

32:16.602 --> 32:18.468
Yeah, this is delicious.
Where should we go next?

32:20.973 --> 32:22.539
Caramel curves,
is that what we're doing?

32:22.541 --> 32:24.374
Yeah, yeah.
Let's go hit up
the caramel curves girls.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.343
Whoo, all right,
let's roll.
Let's do this.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.615
Reedus:
We're taking the four-mile ride
<i>to the northeast side of town</i>

32:31.617 --> 32:33.984
<i>To check out an all-female</i>
<i>motorcycle group</i>

32:33.986 --> 32:36.586
<i>That's been turning heads</i>
<i>even in this eclectic city.</i>

32:44.128 --> 32:46.330
I would love
for you to show me
how to hop a train.

32:46.332 --> 32:49.599
- Okay.
- I mean, hopping trains
must be like--

32:49.601 --> 32:51.735
It must be as old
as trains themselves.

32:51.737 --> 32:55.072
You're exactly right.
It's a class a felony now

32:55.074 --> 32:56.673
To get caught
on federal property.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.542
- You're trespassing.
- Oh, wow.

32:58.544 --> 33:01.678
But it's so jack kerouac,
it's-- you know what I mean?

33:01.680 --> 33:04.081
Oh, yeah, yeah.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.651
Wow, look at
these bikes.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.153
Reedus:
<i>This women-only motorcycle</i>
<i>club, caramel curves,</i>

33:10.155 --> 33:12.622
<i>Was founded right before</i>
<i>hurricane katrina.</i>

33:12.624 --> 33:15.425
<i>And like the city,</i>
<i>they're still standing strong.</i>

33:15.427 --> 33:18.562
I believe we're
at the right place.
I see a foxy.

33:18.564 --> 33:21.231
These are amazing, man.
Let's do it.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.737
Reedus:
<i>With their tricked-out,</i>
<i>custom-painted bikes</i>

33:26.739 --> 33:28.605
<i>And pink mohawk helmets,</i>

33:28.607 --> 33:30.774
<i>These riders</i>
<i>are hard to miss.</i>

33:30.776 --> 33:33.276
And tonight they're celebrating
<i>their 11th anniversary.</i>

33:33.278 --> 33:36.013
Hinds:
<i>Hey, are you guys</i>
<i>the caramel curves?</i>

33:36.015 --> 33:37.280
Woman:
<i>We are the caramel curves.</i>

33:37.282 --> 33:39.016
Hey, hi.
Nice to meet you.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.650
- How are you?
- What's up?

33:40.652 --> 33:42.119
Nice to meet you.
Mel.

33:42.121 --> 33:43.687
The most beautiful bikers
I've ever met.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.455
Without a doubt,
yeah.

33:47.425 --> 33:49.292
How'd you get the name
showstopper?

33:49.294 --> 33:53.063
- You can't tell?

33:53.065 --> 33:56.133
- That's what I'm saying.
- And your bikes are beautiful
out there.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.335
- Thank you.
- Can you do some tricks
for us and stuff?

33:58.337 --> 34:01.038
- ,     yeah, that's what I do.
- Coco is all about tricks.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.773
My tire, when I burn smoke,
it's colored.

34:02.775 --> 34:04.741
- Yeah.
- Omg.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.579
Hinds: <i>This just</i>
<i>looks like the fastest bike</i>
<i>I've seen in a while.</i>

34:09.581 --> 34:12.349
I think these girls
are gonna smoke us.

34:12.351 --> 34:15.352
- Hi.
- I want to get pictures
of you, hold on.

34:15.354 --> 34:17.187
You look so good.

34:17.189 --> 34:19.056
- Thank you.
- Yeah!

34:19.058 --> 34:21.458
What kind
of motor is in here?
Is it a four-cylinder?

34:21.460 --> 34:23.193
990 rotax.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.796
- <i>It has 200 on the dash. </i>
<i>- Hinds:</i> <i>200?!</i>

34:25.798 --> 34:28.365
- Have you pinned it?
- No, I haven't.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.734
Fastest I've ever been
is to right here, 140.

34:30.736 --> 34:33.336
I've gotten to 180
if I'm going to work.

34:33.338 --> 34:35.205
- 180 on the freeway?
- And then I'm a nurse.

34:35.207 --> 34:38.208
- So I got on these scrubs.
- Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.676
<i>Then I'm coming across</i>
<i>that high rise gunning it.</i>

34:39.678 --> 34:42.179
- You ready?
- Yes, ma'am.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.146
All right, let's get it.

34:45.216 --> 34:48.819
whoa!

34:48.821 --> 34:51.488
yeah!

34:51.490 --> 34:54.391
Ho-ho!

34:54.393 --> 34:57.427
- Wow.
- Bbob.

34:57.429 --> 35:00.097
Bad babes on bikes.

35:00.099 --> 35:01.398
I think I'm in love
right now.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.266
High heels
and everything.

35:05.236 --> 35:07.370
- Hinds: <i>That's a 1,000. </i>
<i>- Reedus:</i> <i>Is it really?</i>

35:07.372 --> 35:09.739
- Yeah.
-        Okay, watch the       out, dude.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.374
This is gonna be nutty
right here, yeah.

35:11.376 --> 35:13.677
Oh, stop.

35:17.682 --> 35:20.550
Wow.

35:20.552 --> 35:23.120
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

35:23.122 --> 35:24.621
Wow.

35:25.723 --> 35:27.757
Oh, dang.

35:27.759 --> 35:30.894
<i> Whoo-wee.</i>

35:33.898 --> 35:36.766
A perfect circle, man.
Look at that.
- Perfect.

35:39.770 --> 35:42.873
So tell me, how did
caramel curves start?
Like, how'd you start it?

35:42.875 --> 35:45.375
Well, I was riding
with the guys all the time

35:45.377 --> 35:47.544
And I always thought
it'd be so cool

35:47.546 --> 35:51.248
To pull out with a bunch
of bad chicks on bikes
with heels on, you know?

35:51.250 --> 35:53.283
- Reedus: <i>Oh, yeah. </i>
<i>- And so before you know it,</i>

35:53.285 --> 35:56.653
We went from eight
to we're 27 deep now.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.523
- Oh, wow.
- We have chicago,
baton rouge,

35:59.525 --> 36:01.591
- Memphis, alabama.
- All caramel curves?

36:01.593 --> 36:03.560
All caramel curves.

36:03.562 --> 36:06.696
Tru, show 'em what
girls do on 'busas.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.598
<i>She's got the biggest</i>
<i>bike in the club.</i>

36:08.600 --> 36:10.567
That's a 'busa 1300.

36:10.569 --> 36:13.236
Most guys scared
to ride a 1300.

36:13.238 --> 36:14.437
I'm scared to look at it.

36:22.213 --> 36:24.481
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

36:32.356 --> 36:34.457
Smell the rubber.
Smell it.

36:34.459 --> 36:37.894
Reedus:
<i>What's going on right here?</i>
<i>What is this?</i>

36:37.896 --> 36:41.298
<i>What are you guys</i>
<i>doing right now?</i>
<i>What does this mean?</i>

36:41.300 --> 36:43.400
So you guys are
a roller derby team?

36:43.402 --> 36:44.868
All of a sudden, like,
you guys come rolling down.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.770
I'm like, "what the hell
is going on?"

36:46.772 --> 36:48.305
We thought it'd be better
if we came in a pack.

36:48.307 --> 36:51.474
Somebody take this photo.
This is too good.

36:53.412 --> 36:56.646
I mean,
this is the most random
thing I've ever seen.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.849
- I love it.
- Woman: <i>Caramel...</i>

36:59.851 --> 37:01.718
Curves!

37:01.720 --> 37:03.620
- Too good.
- Bbob!

37:03.622 --> 37:06.690
- Only in new orleans.
- Yeah!

37:06.692 --> 37:08.725
- New orleans is so cool.
- Only in new orleans.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.428
Hinds: <i>Old school.</i>
<i>They hit a rock,</i>
<i>they're going down.</i>

37:11.430 --> 37:13.763
Reedus:
<i>Oh, and one goes down.</i>
<i>It's all right, we got you.</i>

37:13.765 --> 37:15.932
<i>It's on camera.</i>
<i>We got you.</i>

37:19.303 --> 37:21.638
Let me get these
shoes in there. Yeah.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.307
- Yeah.
- Hinds: <i>Wow, wow, wow.</i>

37:24.309 --> 37:26.509
I think we finally
got these hot girls
ready to roll.

37:26.511 --> 37:28.778
<i>"two-hearted woman" playing </i>

37:28.780 --> 37:30.880
Reedus:
<i>The curves are heading</i>
<i>to a party across town</i>

37:30.882 --> 37:32.616
<i>And we're gonna tag along</i>
<i>for a little ride</i>

37:32.618 --> 37:34.451
<i>Before we head out</i>
<i>for the night.</i>

37:35.987 --> 37:40.390

<i>♪ walking a fine line</i>

37:45.530 --> 37:47.764
- Where you guys at,

- We're in the back.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.400
- We're pulling up the rear.
- All right.

37:50.402 --> 37:54.004
<i>♪ live in a man's world,</i>
<i>it will mess with your brain ♪</i>

37:54.006 --> 37:55.505

37:55.507 --> 37:57.440
Yeah!

37:57.442 --> 37:59.909
You know, we got a reputation
'cause we look cute on bikes

37:59.911 --> 38:03.980
And all of that,
but, man, we kick ass
on bikes.

38:03.982 --> 38:07.617

38:07.619 --> 38:10.954
<i>♪ best you can... </i>

38:10.956 --> 38:14.457
So this is what it
feels like to be riding
with the caramel curves.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.526
- It's an amazing feeling.
- This is awesome.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.428
Here we get out.
We say our good-byes.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.363
You know what I'm saying?
Know what I'm saying?

38:20.365 --> 38:21.965
- Come here, girl.
- Glad to meet you.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.434
I'll remember this
for the rest of my life.

38:24.436 --> 38:27.404
- Thank you, baby.
- What a pleasure.
Come here, beautiful.

38:27.406 --> 38:30.440
Reedus:
<i>The caramel curves</i>
<i>are breaking barriers</i>

38:30.442 --> 38:32.309
<i>In motorcycle culture.</i>

38:32.311 --> 38:34.511
<i>Inspiring women to get on</i>
<i>a bike and just be themselves.</i>

38:34.513 --> 38:37.347
- All right.
- Oh, thank you so much.

38:39.016 --> 38:40.984
Reedus:
<i>Hey, brent, come here.</i>
<i>Join us. Come here.</i>

38:40.986 --> 38:43.887
One, two,
caramel curves.

38:43.889 --> 38:46.556
Yo, love you girls.
Caramel...

38:46.558 --> 38:48.625
Curves!

38:48.627 --> 38:51.428
Reedus:
<i>It's been fun,</i>
<i>but we got to keep moving.</i>

38:51.430 --> 38:52.862
Ready, freddy?

38:52.864 --> 38:54.998
- Love you guys.
-           Take it easy.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.866
Reedus:
<i>Now it's our last night</i>
<i>in town</i>

38:56.868 --> 38:58.468
<i>And when the sun</i>
<i>goes down...</i>

38:58.470 --> 38:59.569
Let's go.

39:02.039 --> 39:05.508
<i>...That's when</i>
<i>new orleans wakes up.</i>

39:05.510 --> 39:07.844
<i>And there's a "boondock</i>
<i>saints"-themed bar down here</i>

39:07.846 --> 39:09.012
<i>I really want</i>
<i>to show brent.</i>

39:11.449 --> 39:13.817
- Let's check out
frenchmen street, right?
- Let's do this.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.985
Where's the "boondock
saints" thing you were
talking about?

39:15.987 --> 39:17.921
I can't remember where
it is, to be honest.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.956
I don't know
my way around so well.
We can ask people.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.858
You know what I mean?

39:21.860 --> 39:23.960
- I think--
- hey, daryl!

39:23.962 --> 39:26.029
- What's up, man? Hi.
- Yeah!

39:26.031 --> 39:28.064
Yeah, what's up?

39:28.066 --> 39:30.133
How's that feel?

39:30.135 --> 39:33.069
You know, it feels good.
I never have the guy come
and go, "you suck."

39:33.071 --> 39:35.038
You know what I mean?
So that's good.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.774
Well, anyone ever
came up to me and told
me that I suck...

39:37.776 --> 39:42.045
- I would laugh my ass off.
- ...I would challenge them
to a duel in the parking lot.

39:42.047 --> 39:44.848
Hi, do you guys know where
there's this bar called
the boondock saints bar?

39:44.850 --> 39:47.617
Yeah, where is it at now?
Are we close?

39:47.619 --> 39:49.386
- Let me shake your hand.
- Yes, ma'am.

39:49.388 --> 39:51.388
- I think it's on iberville.
- What is it?

39:51.390 --> 39:53.890
- Iberville.
- Oh, thanks, yeah.

39:53.892 --> 39:57.727
Here we go.
Bring on the madness.

39:58.996 --> 40:01.498
- Good times.
- Yeah, babe.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.769
- I'm so nervous, I'm shaking.
Oh, my god.
- Oh, shush.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.405
- Come on, you got it.
Did it work?
- Yeah.

40:08.407 --> 40:10.039
Where's my dude?

40:10.041 --> 40:13.777
Boom.
One, two, three, four.

40:13.779 --> 40:16.679
Yeah. Uh-huh.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.782
Come here, sweetheart.
Ready? One, two,
three, four.

40:21.552 --> 40:23.420
- Have a good one, guys.
- Man: <i>Daryl!</i>

40:23.422 --> 40:25.822
- Yeah?

40:25.824 --> 40:27.624
- Thank you, sir.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.127
Yeah.
So what's the name
of the street?

40:31.129 --> 40:33.863
I definitely don't want
to be a famous actor,
I know that.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.865
One, two, three, four.
Oh, thanks.

40:35.867 --> 40:39.102
One, two, three, four.
Group shot.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.804
- Thank you so much.
- Have a good one, guys.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.172
- What's your hat?
- Hi.

40:42.174 --> 40:44.574
"tattooed and employed."
I like your hat.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.976
- I love you.
- That's such a good hat.
You want to swap hats?

40:46.978 --> 40:49.446
- Woman: <i>Yes! Yes, swap it. </i>
<i>- For you, I will swap.</i>

40:51.115 --> 40:53.550
Yeah. Cool.

40:53.552 --> 40:55.952
"tattooed and employed."
I love it.

40:58.722 --> 41:00.990
You know what's crazy?
I've been in here.

41:00.992 --> 41:03.860
Jon bernthal and steven yeun
and I ended up in that bar

41:03.862 --> 41:05.695
Where some guy tried
to sell us mushrooms.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.664
Let's go in there
and have a--

41:07.666 --> 41:10.467
- It looks like
a noncrowded place.
- It's a cool bar, yeah.

41:10.469 --> 41:14.137
- Should we have a drink?
- Yeah, yeah, we definitely
need a pit stop.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.573
- Yeah, let's have a pit stop.
- I got a dry mouth.

41:16.575 --> 41:18.975
Let's do it.
Let's grab a drink.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.544
- Cool.
- All right, check this out.
Look.

41:21.546 --> 41:23.713
This is--
I love that this
is a table, dude.

41:23.715 --> 41:26.149
I know, this is killer.
It's a fire hydrant with
a table on it.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.852
- You can pee on it
and drink at it.
- I already peed on it.

41:28.854 --> 41:29.953
- Cheers, dude.
- Cheers. Thanks for having me.

41:29.955 --> 41:31.788
, yeah.

41:31.790 --> 41:34.624
I'm sorry that you're too
popular to go in public.

41:34.626 --> 41:36.059
The cameras
give it away, too.

41:36.061 --> 41:37.961
They kind of draw
a little attention.

41:37.963 --> 41:40.063
You know what I'm saying?
Let's be mobile.

41:40.065 --> 41:41.998
Yeah, there's
a crowd forming.

41:43.734 --> 41:45.502
Reedus:
<i>Nothing personal,</i>
<i>but brent and I</i>

41:45.504 --> 41:48.171
<i>Are gonna go enjoy our last</i>
<i>night on our own.</i>

41:48.173 --> 41:49.906
<i>See if we can go</i>
<i>find this bar.</i>

41:49.908 --> 41:52.008
That way?

41:52.010 --> 41:54.777
Where the hell is this
"boondock saints" bar?

41:54.779 --> 41:55.945
I have no idea.

42:09.593 --> 42:11.628
It's been a real
pleasure, you know?

42:11.630 --> 42:13.096
This has been such
a beautiful ride.

42:13.098 --> 42:15.131
You have an open invitation

42:15.133 --> 42:17.200
To anywhere I go
for the rest of my life.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.635
Yeah, you, too, man.

42:18.637 --> 42:20.103
Reedus:
<i>Bob dylan once said,</i>

42:20.105 --> 42:21.971
<i>"there's a lot</i>
<i>of places I like,</i>

42:21.973 --> 42:23.773
<i>But I like</i>
<i>new orleans better."</i>

42:23.775 --> 42:26.543
<i>Leaving louisiana,</i>
<i>I know exactly what he meant.</i>

42:26.545 --> 42:29.946
<i>From the crawfish</i>
<i>and gator whisperers</i>
<i>we met on the bayou</i>

42:29.948 --> 42:32.248
<i>To the voodoo priestess</i>
<i>and the caramel curves,</i>

42:32.250 --> 42:34.784
<i>Even the hard-living guys</i>
<i>like brent,</i>

42:34.786 --> 42:38.655
<i>This place has always survived</i>
<i>by welcoming all different</i>
<i>kinds of people,</i>

42:38.657 --> 42:42.592
<i>Whether they're escaping</i>
<i>persecution or just looking</i>
<i>for a fresh start.</i>

42:42.594 --> 42:45.695
<i>And even though I didn't</i>
<i>find that bar in the end,</i>
<i>that's okay.</i>

42:45.697 --> 42:47.697
<i>I found so much more.</i>

42:47.699 --> 42:50.733
- Did you turn my seat
heater on, buddy?
- I might have.

42:50.735 --> 42:53.703
- damn it, norman.
