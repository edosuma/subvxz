"I'm warning you, I'm
going to get angry. Do you see?

00:43.752 --> 00:46.119
"We are going to have fun
on this island, understand?

00:46.338 --> 00:48.500
"We are going to have fun
on this island.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.707
"'Come now, ' said the
Lord of the Flies.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.885
"Get back to the others and
we'll forget the whole thing.

00:54.096 --> 00:57.339
"This has gone quite far enough,
my poor, misguided child.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.641
"Do you think you know
better than I do?"

00:59.851 --> 01:02.969
Okay, so we have civilization
versus savagery,

01:03.188 --> 01:06.397
and reason versus impulse.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.225
So many exciting themes
in one little book, right?

01:12.239 --> 01:15.107
Over the break, I want you to
read the next three chapters.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.942
That's three chapters, and
I want you to write two pages...

01:18.161 --> 01:19.697
on either one of our themes,
your choice.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.454
Demerius.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.497
Care to read us out to the bell?

01:25.794 --> 01:28.081
No, no, no, not that one.
The one that you have on your lap there.

01:28.297 --> 01:29.253
What is it?

01:29.506 --> 01:32.340
Uh... Demon Sword Z.

01:33.885 --> 01:37.629
Okay, let's hear it. Oh, come
on. Let's finish class strong.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.888
"Now I have the power
of the five souls.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.935
"Let us see what the
Gauntlet of Destiny...

01:45.105 --> 01:47.017
"has to say about that,
demon lover.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.771
"Then, the squid leg splits
Okami-san in half.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.106
"Blood sprays everywhere."

01:53.322 --> 01:57.362
This is 26% stronger than
anything else on the market.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.408
It lasts up to four hours.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.282
Not only are the lips fuller...

02:01.496 --> 02:03.613
they're the most fantastic color.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.453
Slight tingle at first,
but it's so worth it.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.669
- Better than collagen.
- Where is this from?

02:09.880 --> 02:13.214
The Orient... a lot of the
formulas are secret.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.218
- I own the North American rights.
- Oh, that's lovely.

02:17.429 --> 02:20.513
And this would be an exclusive
for Harold's.

02:23.393 --> 02:26.136
That's really starting to work.

02:26.355 --> 02:27.846
What kind of comic is this?

02:28.065 --> 02:29.601
It's not a comic, it's manga.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.853
"Put your demon powers in me,
squid.

02:32.069 --> 02:34.061
"I want to feel your might
deep within."

02:34.279 --> 02:36.771
Damn, its tentacles are like
its dicks.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.107
- Zack, your right.
- "Hold back nothing, my pet.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.535
- After I summon the demon, all you..."
- Mr. Moss. Hello.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.037
We found some surprising
thematic similarities...

02:45.248 --> 02:46.739
between Lord of the Flies...

02:49.211 --> 02:51.544
Okay, all right.
You owe me two pages.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.380
Have a really good break.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.626
- Where is this from?
- Asia.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.723
D-P-R-K... isn't that
North Korea?

03:06.103 --> 03:09.972
You're trying to sell Harold's
a North Korean product?

03:10.190 --> 03:11.226
Maybe.

03:11.441 --> 03:15.731
The North Korea against which
the United States has an embargo?

03:15.946 --> 03:19.280
Now, that embargo is kind
of like Cuba, you know?

03:19.491 --> 03:21.073
It's sort of symbolic.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.197
20 years, Kate. Seen it all.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.361
Right.

03:25.539 --> 03:29.829
Well, maybe not sex
with an octopus. That was a first.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.994
- That was mine, too.
- Please.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.630
I wanted your help to strategize
a big picture issue...

03:36.800 --> 03:38.792
because I see something
we both share.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.551
A deep love for this school.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.302
Go Falcons.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.507
I wanna do a little
right-brained thinking...

03:45.726 --> 03:47.388
about a left-brain problem.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.343
Are we talking about
the ARB test scores?

03:49.563 --> 03:51.350
I'm talking about empowerment.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.182
I'm saying let's be the change.

03:55.026 --> 03:58.770
Let's not squander our energy
on acrimony and recriminations.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.404
Um... are you firing me?

04:03.618 --> 04:05.655
- What?
- I'm sorry.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.783
I'm trying to ground floor
the discussions...

04:07.998 --> 04:10.456
so we don't waste our school's
resources on arbitration...

04:10.667 --> 04:11.953
and severance packages.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.331
Those things threaten the school
that we love.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.253
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.627
Sometimes a school can avoid
all that heartache...

04:18.841 --> 04:21.630
if a teacher simply vacates
his or her post.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.337
- You want me to quit?
- No.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.843
That's a personal decision.
What I want doesn't matter.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.549
But I will say this...

04:28.769 --> 04:33.981
I see you flourishing in as slightly
less urban teaching environment...

04:34.191 --> 04:36.979
or perhaps in an
altogether different...

04:38.820 --> 04:40.561
Can I admit something?

04:40.781 --> 04:43.569
You always have great hair.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.118
Perhaps you'd be happy
cutting hair.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.536
Look, I took this meeting...

04:49.706 --> 04:51.447
because Lucas spoke
highly of you.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.827
He better have.

04:53.084 --> 04:56.168
But I don't think this
is a good fit for Harold's.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.372
- Best of luck.
- Seriously? That's it?

04:59.591 --> 05:01.708
Just because of where
a product's made?

05:01.927 --> 05:04.260
A bit racist, don't you think?

05:04.471 --> 05:06.007
Okay, we're done.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.510
No, you're done.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.433
Because I'll take my business
elsewhere.

05:11.937 --> 05:14.099
- Where's the bathroom?
- Uh, there.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.150
Oh my god. Oh...

05:24.282 --> 05:28.447
What the fuck?
That's my fucking car! Fuck!

05:43.593 --> 05:46.256
- There she is!
- Hey...

05:46.471 --> 05:49.009
- how'd it go?
- Come dance with me!

05:49.224 --> 05:52.717
- What's going on?
- Shake that bony ass of yours!

05:56.773 --> 05:59.982
- What is happening? Did you sell it?
- Party bump!

06:04.114 --> 06:05.605
Meg, did you sell it?

06:05.824 --> 06:07.611
Can we finally get rid of all
these boxes?

06:07.826 --> 06:09.863
Remember all those little
North Korea stickers...

06:10.036 --> 06:11.322
we peeled off the bottles?

06:11.538 --> 06:13.951
Yeah, of course. There were,
like, 10,000 of them.

06:14.165 --> 06:17.533
Well, it turns out
there's 10,001.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.661
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.794
I am totally and thoroughly
fucked.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.802
On the other hand my car
got towed.

06:27.971 --> 06:30.008
- How was your day?
- Meg, it's...

06:30.223 --> 06:31.805
I can't.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.134
I don't even wanna talk
about it.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.014
Wow, how much did you spend?

06:40.775 --> 06:43.813
Oh, I'm gonna bring it back.
But I'm gonna keep some socks.

06:45.363 --> 06:48.026
- How was school?
- Great.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.403
- Moss asked me to quit.
- What?

06:53.622 --> 06:56.990
He thinks that I'd be happier
cutting hair.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.245
Did you point out that
he's bald as fuck?

07:00.545 --> 07:02.377
No, I didn't tell him
he was bald as fuck.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.626
Are you getting fired?

07:04.841 --> 07:07.584
Excuse me.
I gotta get going.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.627
Okay.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.509
- Can I get my clothes?
- Oh, right.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.804
Sorry. I can't seem to...

07:16.019 --> 07:17.226
- Shirt, pants...
- Hi.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.518
- pink underwear...
- Hi.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.395
Nope, that's mine.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.439
Thanks for the lift.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.185
You're gonna give me
a good review, right?

07:26.404 --> 07:27.770
Five stars.

07:34.496 --> 07:35.907
You buy socks and I suck...

07:36.122 --> 07:38.455
Okay, okay, I got it, I got it.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.330
<i>- Hey, ladies.
- Hey!</i>

07:42.379 --> 07:43.540
<i>What?</i>

07:43.713 --> 07:46.581
- She's back?!
- Oh my god!

07:47.801 --> 07:49.918
- Holy shit.
<i>- How's it going?</i>

07:52.430 --> 07:55.264
That haircut took balls, you
have to hand it to her there.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.807
Are we still drinking?

07:57.018 --> 07:58.805
Hells to the yeah, mothafucka.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.056
Sweet.

08:00.271 --> 08:03.309
<i>I'm 28-years-old, I've had a
lot of success, and I'm ready.</i>

08:04.067 --> 08:05.899
Meg, you're missing the abs.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.398
<i>With whom I spend
the rest of my life.</i>

08:08.613 --> 08:10.479
Why do these girls
play hard to get?

08:10.699 --> 08:12.941
If it was up to me I'd have his
pants around his ankles...

08:13.159 --> 08:14.570
by the first commercial.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.529
Well, it's a game.
They're playing strategy.

08:17.706 --> 08:21.541
<i>Actually satisfy me
on a day-to-day basis.</i>

08:22.544 --> 08:24.786
I actually think I'd be pretty
good on this show.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.874
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You're hardly competitive, dear.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.585
You don't have an aggressive
bone in your body.

08:32.761 --> 08:35.174
Against these girls, you'd have
to put on your big-girl pants...

08:35.390 --> 08:36.631
or they'd have you for lunch.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.807
<i>I think I'd describe myself as
definitely thinking outside...</i>

08:39.019 --> 08:40.179
Whatever.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.602
<i>I march to the beat
of my own drum.</i>

08:42.772 --> 08:44.855
<i>A really nice day for me
is wak...</i>

08:45.066 --> 08:47.103
I actually like the whole
construction worker thing.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.809
You know, the whole, like,
works with his hands,

08:49.029 --> 08:50.190
salt-of-the-earth motif.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.818
The only thing salty about him
is his balls.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.904
- Lovely, Meg.
<i>- Doesn't that just roll off your tongue-</i>

08:56.119 --> 08:58.862
You can have him, if I can have
the fireman from last season.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.993
- Oh, that fireman.
- He was a panty-dropper.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.497
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.966
And for the record, just because
I don't sleep around...

09:13.178 --> 09:15.215
doesn't mean I couldn't compete
against a group of women...

09:15.430 --> 09:17.922
Did you just take a shot at me?
Was that a drive-by?

09:18.141 --> 09:20.804
You drive-by-ed me.
"Big-girl pants"?

09:21.019 --> 09:24.512
That was a slick move.
She's definitely getting a rose.

09:24.689 --> 09:28.182
<i>I know it's crazy to give out roses
before the first rose ceremony...</i>

09:28.401 --> 09:31.439
<i>- but I don't care.
- Oh my god...</i>

09:31.654 --> 09:34.317
You know, it's been a long day.
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.403
I just opened a new bottle.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.362
- Come on, let's finish it.
- No, I'm going to bed.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.072
No morning re-cap.
I'm watching the rest.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.574
<i>These girls mean nothing to me.</i>

09:45.794 --> 09:47.706
<i>This is a nightmare.</i>

09:50.548 --> 09:52.164
Kate?

09:52.383 --> 09:53.919
- Kate, wake up.
- What, is there a fire?

09:54.135 --> 09:55.922
- No, there's no fire.
- What's wrong? What's going on?

09:56.137 --> 09:58.629
We're screwed up. Our lives,
things aren't going well.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.464
Is it really 4:15?

10:00.683 --> 10:03.221
Remember in the ninth grade when
you got stung by that jellyfish and...

10:03.436 --> 10:05.678
- I peed on you and you got really mad?
- Did you take one of my pills?

10:05.897 --> 10:07.684
You were really mad until it
stopped hurting...

10:07.899 --> 10:09.106
- right?
- Yeah.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.229
When you're faced with a
life-threatening problem...

10:11.444 --> 10:14.357
which we are, you step away
from the problem...

10:14.572 --> 10:17.781
and in a calm, adult way,
you self-medicate...

10:17.992 --> 10:19.984
until the solution presents itself.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.193
Okay.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.199
Preferably on a beach
with a margarita.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.625
- Okay, let's talk about it.
- Yes! That's my girl.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.624
- Can we plan this in the morning?
- No, we gotta go.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.333
- What? Where?
- Fort Lauderdale.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.336
- I used your Sky Miles.
- Today?

10:34.551 --> 10:36.793
Now! Our flight's in three hours.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.878
Meg, absolutely not,
that's crazy.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.430
I'm not going on vacation right now.
You're completely insane.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.933
We are going to miss this flight!
This is completely insane!

10:45.145 --> 10:47.888
Why even ask me, if you're gonna
just make us miss the goddamn flight?

10:48.106 --> 10:50.098
- Sir, we can get out here.
- Stop. Stop. Stop!

10:50.316 --> 10:52.023
- Don't yell at the poor guy.
- Thank you, sir.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.352
You pay the driver,
I'll get the bags.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.780
Oh my god. Look at this line!

10:57.949 --> 10:59.781
We are going to miss
this flight!

11:00.743 --> 11:02.655
I cannot believe this.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.612
I kept telling you
that we had to leave.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.868
This happens every single time.
Look at this line!

11:07.083 --> 11:10.167
There's no way we are making this flight.
These are non-refundable tickets.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.869
I told you you can
take a bath...

11:12.088 --> 11:14.125
or you can poach an egg
and not both.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.548
Meg. Meg. What're you doing?

11:16.718 --> 11:18.380
- Hold on.
- Get in line!

11:18.803 --> 11:20.544
Excuse me.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.629
My friend and I are about
to miss our flight.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.556
Is there any way
we can come in this line?

11:24.767 --> 11:26.884
Are you first class
or an Elite Club member?

11:27.103 --> 11:28.719
We're first-class ladies.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.848
Actually, I think I am
an Elite Club member...

11:33.067 --> 11:34.148
if it didn't expire.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.693
Hold on, let me check.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.775
No, it's not...

11:45.788 --> 11:47.745
Shoot. I guess not.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.414
Sorry about that.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.414
Thanks for your help.
And thanks for keeping us safe.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.295
I just do check-in.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.719
- Why do you always do that?
- Do what?

12:06.935 --> 12:08.346
It's embarrassing.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.310
Told you.

12:19.197 --> 12:22.031
You can't just cut in front
of all these...

12:22.867 --> 12:24.153
Sorry.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.994
Sorry. Sorry.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.368
Sorry. Sorry.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.917
Oh my god,
you are the sweetest thing.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.790
Don't worry about it.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.041
You hungry?

12:40.677 --> 12:42.543
You could have checked your bag.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.713
I was trying to save some money.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.299
- You okay?
- Yeah.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.680
You got your headphones,
pills, neck pillow...

12:50.895 --> 12:52.511
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.017
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be epic.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.520
- Yeah.
- Deep breath.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.896
Ma'am, no liquids
above 3.4 ounces.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.198
You can dispose of it in that
trash can right there.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.901
You want me to get rid of it?
Sure thing.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.047
- It's easier when it's a beer.
- Have a good flight.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.675
Deep breath, girl.

13:30.893 --> 13:34.011
We're going to Florida.
It's gonna be so much fun.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.724
Think of the beach,
think of the sunshine.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.267
Here's your neck pillow.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.897
Six hours in the air.
Up and down.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.321
- Please don't say "down".
- We're still on the ground.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.569
Yeah, I know, but we're
high enough already.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.984
Middle seats are for suckers,
right?

13:49.203 --> 13:51.320
You know what? I actually think
it'd be better if we switched.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.280
I would,
but I need extra legroom.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.741
It's sort of a Gandalf-Bilbo
situation.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.835
- And I'm the hobbit?
- Oh my...

13:59.047 --> 14:01.630
I'm just saying, I'm taller.
Here, take a pill.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.673
- I already took a pill.
- Take another.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.423
Okay.
I'll get you a water.

14:06.637 --> 14:09.129
- No, I don't need any water...
- Excuse me...

14:09.349 --> 14:12.217
can she get a water
so she can take her anti-anxiety pill?

14:12.435 --> 14:14.097
Certainly.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.178
Can we please keep this
to ourselves?

14:16.397 --> 14:18.480
I was just trying to help.
It's not like I gave him your social.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.648
Just quit with the flirty routine,
it's getting really old.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.819
I wasn't. Geez.
Take a deep breath, girl.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.188
I'm surprised you
didn't show him your bra.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.694
I think he might try
and wear it, am I right?

14:30.328 --> 14:31.864
Oh my god.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.787
- Oh my god!
- Soda's coming up.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.661
Oh, Jesus Christ, Meg.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.458
I feel like I am in your intestines.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.080
- Take it.
- Stop it!

14:40.296 --> 14:42.333
- Oh my god!
- I got one more comin', too.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.665
Excuse me. I think
I'm in the middle there.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.144
Thank you.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.404
Hi.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.747
- Here's your water.
- Thank you.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.540
Dear lord.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.719
- I'm Meg, by the way.
- Ryan.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.551
So what is it, Ryan?
Business or pleasure?

15:37.770 --> 15:39.386
It's a wedding, actually.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.518
Ah, which can sometimes
feel like work, right?

15:42.733 --> 15:44.895
I feel like last year,
I was at somebody's wedding...

15:45.111 --> 15:48.024
- every other weekend.
- Yeah, they come in waves, don't they?

15:48.239 --> 15:49.320
Yeah.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.320
How about you?
What brings you out?

15:52.535 --> 15:54.367
- I have...
- A girl's trip.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.992
I kinda hate that expression,
but it's true.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.947
We are on a trip and we are girls.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.334
- Okay, so you two are together?
- Yeah, we're best friends.

16:03.546 --> 16:06.163
We're just sitting in these
seats because, you know...

16:06.382 --> 16:08.169
middle seats are for suckers.

16:08.551 --> 16:12.135
Ah, my, uh, reputation
precedes me.

16:15.266 --> 16:18.009
I love weddings.
As long as they're other people's.

16:18.227 --> 16:21.561
- Yeah, that's the truth, right?
- Single ladies in the house.

16:23.441 --> 16:26.354
- I'm Kate, by the way.
- Hey, Ryan. It's good to meet you.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.312
- You too.
- I'm still Meg. Look at us!

16:29.530 --> 16:31.863
Meg Ryan.
We're America's sweetheart.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.274
Do you remember that deli scene?

16:34.494 --> 16:37.032
Yeah, yeah, the, uh,
"I'll have what she's having".

16:42.835 --> 16:45.122
I think that my roommate
is trying to do a scene...

16:45.338 --> 16:47.375
from When Harry Met Slarry.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.340
When Harry Met Smarly.

16:51.594 --> 16:54.211
- When... Smarly Met...
- You okay?

16:56.265 --> 16:57.801
- Is she having a stroke?
- She's fine.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.134
- She's just terrified of flying.
- Smarly... met Marley.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.185
She took some pharmaceuticals.
- Marley...

17:02.396 --> 17:04.353
- Stay there.
- I'm jealous.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.477
It's gonna be all right.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.486
Well, I'll stop bothering you guys.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.404
Oh, you're not bothering...

17:17.662 --> 17:20.369
<i>Hello, folks.
This is your captain speaking.</i>

17:20.580 --> 17:23.324
<i>Hurricane Cindy has headed
toward the Carolinas...</i>

17:23.542 --> 17:25.409
<i>but it looks like she's
taken a bit of a turn...</i>

17:25.627 --> 17:27.790
<i>and now they're re-directing
us to land in St. Louis.</i>

17:28.005 --> 17:30.543
<i>We'll keep you updated as we
receive additional information.</i>

17:30.758 --> 17:33.876
- Oh, man.
- Since when is there a hurricane?

17:34.095 --> 17:36.758
It's... been in the news,
like all week.

17:37.682 --> 17:41.016
I'm not much of a news junkie.
I'm more of a bookworm.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.014
This is just a hate-read.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.145
Excuse me, ladies,
I'm gonna need you to...

17:49.360 --> 17:51.272
Oh, god. Really?

17:51.862 --> 17:53.649
Did you need something?

17:54.115 --> 17:56.858
Put your seat up,
and your friend, too, please.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.534
Kate? Kate. Wake up
for the male steward.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.032
It's "flight attendant".
I'm moving her forward.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.659
We're landing soon.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.115
Holy shit.

18:06.294 --> 18:08.707
Is she... is she okay?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.503
Let me just...

18:13.509 --> 18:15.626
We're good. We're good.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.396
Welcome to The Sheraton.

18:38.743 --> 18:42.236
This is the pits.
Fuck you, Cindy.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.038
- Who's Cindy?
- The hurricane.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.450
I dunno, it looks like kinda
good weather for a hurricane.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.207
The hurricane's in Florida,
we're in St. Louis.

18:51.422 --> 18:54.085
Jesus, you took
way too many pills.

18:57.345 --> 18:59.883
Welcome to the St. Louis
Sheraton, I am Anuj.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.630
- How are we today?
- Not good, Anuj.

19:01.807 --> 19:05.596
- The airline says they lost my bag.
- They did? Did they lose mine?

19:05.770 --> 19:07.557
No, they didn't.
You didn't check a bag.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.892
Oh, right, I didn't check a bag.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.225
My apologies, we're tight on space
because of the annual jewelry convention.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.855
Jewelers have conventions?

19:15.071 --> 19:18.655
However, I can put you both
in a lovely junior suite.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.404
Now, while you're here,
please enjoy our four-star restaurant...

19:21.619 --> 19:23.611
pool, spa,
and complimentary shuttle service...

19:23.788 --> 19:27.077
to the majestic St. Louis Arch
and finally, Tut's Tomb...

19:27.291 --> 19:29.533
the number one nightclub
in St. Louis two years running.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.210
For that,
take the elevator down to P1.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.128
That's super, but we're
only here for one night.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.333
Excellent. Well, if you enjoy your stay,
I do hope you'll consider Yelping us.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.138
Oh god. This is what we get
for being spontaneous.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.470
Oh my god, what is that color?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.803
It's not a lipstick,
it's my Lip Lacerater.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.603
Oh, it's fantastic.

19:50.773 --> 19:52.230
Thanks.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.483
Oh, hey, it's my seat mates.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.237
- Good to see you among the living.
- Yeah, thank you.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.110
Okay, I need to go down
one more I think.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.783
I'm gonna work off some travel
frustration at the gym.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.570
- Oh, god, your friend's wedding.
- Yeah, yeah. It's not for a few days.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.122
I was, uh, going down early
for the bachelor party...

20:09.333 --> 20:11.325
but those guys'll be fine.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.582
No natural disaster's gonna stop my buds
from getting embarrassingly drunk.

20:17.675 --> 20:21.294
Hey, um, you guys wanna get
a drink later on tonight?

20:22.513 --> 20:24.800
Might as well
make the best of this, right?

20:26.100 --> 20:27.386
- Yeah. Yeah, sure, yeah.
- Sure. Yeah.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.217
- I like... I like to drink.
- She does.

20:29.437 --> 20:31.599
Not a lot, not to excess, but...

20:31.772 --> 20:32.979
Alcohol.

20:33.607 --> 20:34.768
Cool. How about 8:00?

20:34.942 --> 20:38.185
- Yeah, yeah, it's a date.
- Well, not a date, but a plan.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.898
Yeah.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.731
- Have a good workout.
- Stretch, don't forget!

20:42.950 --> 20:44.486
- Now don't... do gym.
- Don't hurt yourself.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.157
- Oh, not bad.
- And it smells nice, too.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.113
- Not bad at all.
- Yeah.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.699
And look at us,
having drinks with a hot guy.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.160
Hey, he's having drinks with us.

20:55.921 --> 20:56.911
Right.

20:57.131 --> 21:00.499
And who knows? Maybe one of us
will hook up, if he's lucky.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.380
He might go for you.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.383
Or you. You're gorgeous,
especially when you're loaded.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.590
I am not, I look like
Mickey Rourke.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.680
Enough with Mickey Rourke.
Why do you always say that?

21:10.853 --> 21:13.186
- It's how I feel.
- Stop it.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.104
You're beautiful.

21:15.733 --> 21:18.771
This is called
"Man Getting Out of Cold Lake".

21:19.820 --> 21:22.153
Thank god I packed my Spanx.

21:22.364 --> 21:25.732
Oh my god, my bag.
Can I borrow a dress?

21:25.951 --> 21:28.944
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I only packed one.

21:29.163 --> 21:30.620
Can I wear it?

21:31.415 --> 21:32.576
No.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.742
- Well, what if you...
- No.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.583
Anuj.
Is there a mall around here?

21:38.756 --> 21:40.338
Can you hold on one second,
please?

21:40.549 --> 21:42.336
- What's that?
- The closest mall?

21:42.551 --> 21:44.338
That would be the Westgate
Pavilion near the arch.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.215
- How far is the arch?
- 30 minutes without traffic.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.389
- Damn it. I need a dress.
- We can call a taxi for you.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.638
- June, will you please call...
- No, I need one now, tonight.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.266
- What would you like me to do?
- Fine.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.849
Sir, are you still there?
Yeah, Okay, so those last three digits...

21:59.068 --> 22:00.934
How do I leave a review on Yelp?

22:01.654 --> 22:03.816
Can you hold on just
one more second, please?

22:09.119 --> 22:10.985
Hey. Wow.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.363
Right?

22:13.582 --> 22:15.369
Where's your other half?

22:15.584 --> 22:18.122
I don't know. Might just be me.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.750
Well, you uh,
you look very nice.

22:21.090 --> 22:24.925
Thank you. I didn't pack too much
'cause it's really just a girl's trip...

22:25.135 --> 22:28.003
but I thought, you know,
I'd try something with what I have...

22:28.222 --> 22:29.838
Holy shit.

22:33.811 --> 22:35.598
- You look amazing.
- You like it?

22:35.813 --> 22:39.272
- I wasn't sure I could pull it off.
- No, no. You look great.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.021
Meg's an expert
at pulling off a dress.

22:42.236 --> 22:45.024
Okay, uh, let me go see
if I can snag us a booth.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.774
- Where did you get that?
- The Indian dude at the front desk.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.280
His mom loaned it to me.
Crazy, right?

22:51.495 --> 22:52.576
That is so crazy.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.658
Hey there, you ladies
here for Jewel Con?

22:54.874 --> 22:56.911
No, uh, we're just...
we're meeting some friends.

22:57.126 --> 23:00.415
Yes, yes, you are... us.
<i>Namaste.</i>

23:00.629 --> 23:03.042
I'm Craig, precious gems
are my specialty.

23:03.257 --> 23:06.341
Chuck here is in, uh,
high-end watch repair.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.384
Shahar does imports.

23:08.596 --> 23:10.758
"Shahar" is Hebrew
for "sunrise"...

23:10.973 --> 23:13.932
which you will experience
tomorrow morning in my bed.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.723
- That was smooth. Very smooth.
- She didn't refuse, that's good.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.559
- Yeah, well...
- I have cocaine.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.639
Whoa, Chuck, put it away.

23:21.859 --> 23:24.602
He's very excited he has cocaine.
He's been showing it to everybody.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.233
I smuggled it on the plane
in my underpants.

23:28.157 --> 23:30.274
Enough about us,
and you guys are...?

23:30.868 --> 23:34.236
Undercover federal agents
investigating a counterfeit diamond ring.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.868
So you can either step aside
and let us do our job...

23:37.082 --> 23:39.495
or I'll give Kate here the green light
to shove her taser in your ass...

23:39.710 --> 23:42.623
- and light you up.
- Okay, sorry, officers.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.253
Let's go.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.682
Hey. I glommed on to
some fellow travelers.

23:59.897 --> 24:02.389
This is Roger and Nancy,
Kate and Meg.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.646
Oh my god, you look like
a fucking princess.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.318
Thanks, it's a sari.

24:07.529 --> 24:10.112
Honey, you got nothing
to be sorry about.

24:10.324 --> 24:12.236
Roger and Nancy are celebrating
their anniversary.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.989
Ten years
and I think I'll keep her.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.660
- That's sweet.
- Shit.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.200
Category four?

24:22.419 --> 24:25.378
- So much for losing steam.
- No one's getting out of here tomorrow.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.664
I'm not gonna make
the rehearsal dinner.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.250
Oh, come on,
don't think like that.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.882
Yeah, hurricanes are
notoriously unpredictable.

24:33.097 --> 24:36.590
That's why they name them
after women, right?

24:37.059 --> 24:39.767
It was a slam-dunk case,
see this guy didn't have a prayer...

24:39.979 --> 24:42.266
but he did have this gorgeous
defense attorney.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.848
Gorgeous and <i>gifted</i>
defense attorney.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.684
- All charges were dropped.
- Well, not entirely...

24:47.861 --> 24:49.818
I did manage to negotiate
into the plea bargain...

24:50.030 --> 24:51.771
that Nancy go on a date with me.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.859
First time in my career,
I got two men off in one day.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.160
More than once, as I recall.

24:57.371 --> 25:00.580
- I could have you dis-barred, you know?
- Yeah? I could have you mounted.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.874
- I'll mount you.
- Did you bring the cuffs?

25:03.085 --> 25:04.917
- I'll blindfold you first.
- Oh, interrogation.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.665
Or Q & A?

25:07.089 --> 25:09.172
I think we lost them.

25:10.384 --> 25:12.296
What about you guys?
What do you do?

25:12.636 --> 25:14.298
I'm a CEO.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.847
- Wow.
- I sell a line of skin care products.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.720
You know Michelle Obama?

25:19.935 --> 25:21.176
Is she a client?

25:21.395 --> 25:25.014
Well, obviously I can't talk about it...
but how about her skin?

25:25.232 --> 25:28.316
Damn. Damn.
What about you, Kate?

25:29.361 --> 25:31.569
I'm a teacher...
I teach high school.

25:31.780 --> 25:32.987
Oh, nice.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.983
Special needs high school.

25:36.201 --> 25:39.114
Wow. Is that hard?

25:39.329 --> 25:42.242
You know what's hard is not
being with them right now.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.791
A lot of people think that
I teach them... but...

25:45.002 --> 25:46.914
but really, you know,
they teach me.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.370
Yeah.

25:48.589 --> 25:51.206
The blind teach me
how to listen better...

25:51.425 --> 25:53.462
and the mute teach me...

25:53.677 --> 25:58.263
you know, not to talk so much,
so I'm gonna stop.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.929
Man, I can't compete with you two.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.431
I'm just a firefighter.

26:07.649 --> 26:09.641
<i>All right, what's up,
everybody? Come on.</i>

26:09.818 --> 26:12.310
Eh-yo, this is DJ Spooj,
rhymes with Anuj...

26:12.529 --> 26:15.818
'cause we both gonna be on
your face by the end of the night.

26:16.450 --> 26:19.238
<i>All the junkies in the house say "ho".</i>
- Ho!

26:19.453 --> 26:21.615
<i>All the wacky knickers
in the house say "eh-yo".</i>

26:21.830 --> 26:22.911
Eh-yo!

26:23.123 --> 26:25.866
<i>All right, let's get to it.
Have a good night, everybody.</i>

26:28.670 --> 26:31.378
- You guys wanna dance?
- Who me?

26:56.490 --> 26:58.732
If you're having a good time.
You guys know what to do.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.404
Yelp us.

27:38.615 --> 27:42.279
Oh shit, let's get a muh-fuckin
dance circle up in here!

27:42.494 --> 27:44.110
Show DJ Spooj what you got!

28:32.336 --> 28:35.955
Meg! Hey!
Your boob is hanging out!

28:39.092 --> 28:40.048
Got it.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.307
How long was it out?

28:53.482 --> 28:55.439
20 seconds.

28:55.651 --> 28:58.519
That's the length of a fucking
Geico commercial.

28:58.737 --> 29:02.230
You know, I'm impressed anyone could
have upstaged that flight attendant.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.781
Well, this is you, guys.

29:09.206 --> 29:10.913
I had a...
I had a really good time tonight.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.787
Yeah, me too...
despite, you know...

29:14.920 --> 29:16.502
- Night.
- Night.

29:20.217 --> 29:21.173
Hey.

29:21.343 --> 29:22.424
- Yeah?
- What's up?

29:22.636 --> 29:24.502
You know, since we're gonna be
stuck here tomorrow...

29:24.721 --> 29:26.713
it may be nice to see the city.

29:26.932 --> 29:29.345
Maybe get a little crazy, buy a
St. Louis magnet for the fridge?

29:29.559 --> 29:32.472
- Yeah, I actually need a magnet.
- I have a fridge.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.179
Great. Let's just connect
in the morning then.

29:34.398 --> 29:36.640
- Okay. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

29:36.858 --> 29:39.350
Hey, you know what?
I, uh, I'm actually gonna ride up with you.

29:39.569 --> 29:41.982
The, uh, the ice machine
on our floor is broken, so...

29:42.197 --> 29:43.779
- Oh.
- What do you need ice for?

29:44.741 --> 29:46.448
- Ice water.
- Wait, you can't go.

29:46.660 --> 29:49.152
- I need you to open our door.
- We... we both have keys.

29:49.371 --> 29:50.703
I left mine in the room.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.280
- I think that's the bell...
- Well here, whatever...

29:52.499 --> 29:53.785
you can just take mine.

29:54.001 --> 29:56.118
You know what?
I'll just go with you.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.669
Don't be silly, you don't need
two people to get ice.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.587
I just thought it would be
easier for you.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.756
Elevator's closing,
good luck with the ice, guys.

30:02.968 --> 30:03.958
- Oh, goodnight!
- Goodnight!

30:04.136 --> 30:05.377
Ice? Really?

30:05.595 --> 30:08.679
- At least I didn't pull my boob out.
- Do you think I did that on purpose?

30:08.849 --> 30:11.341
- I know that you did. You have great tits.
- That's insane!

30:11.560 --> 30:13.222
Listen, I know you wanna
do your thing...

30:13.437 --> 30:15.929
- Not the great tits part.
- But I actually like him.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.265
Well, I love him.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.019
- You love him?
- Yes, I love him.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.227
- You don't even know his last name.
- So?

30:22.446 --> 30:24.608
Do Romeo and Juliet
know each other's last name?

30:24.823 --> 30:27.440
Yes! Montague and Capulet.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.493
Oh, I'm an English teacher.

30:31.204 --> 30:32.945
I want him.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.206
Not this time.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.751
You want me to choose?

30:38.962 --> 30:40.749
Whichever,
we're totally cool with it.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.671
Yeah, totally. I'm cool, too.

30:42.883 --> 30:46.502
Well, I mean, they say the
St. Louis art museum's pretty great...

30:46.720 --> 30:49.303
but what a day to hit
the botanical gardens, right?

30:49.514 --> 30:52.257
Or door number three.

30:52.476 --> 30:54.763
Boom! A hot air balloon ride!

30:54.978 --> 30:57.061
- Now that is rad.
- A balloon?

30:57.272 --> 30:59.605
He said he wanted to see the city.
This way he can see all of it.

30:59.816 --> 31:02.559
Aw, man, this seems way more fun
than paintings and plants.

31:02.736 --> 31:04.819
Yeah well, you know,
it's not just paintings, it's...

31:05.030 --> 31:07.067
it's furniture and sculptures...

31:07.324 --> 31:09.691
Oh, I forgot your fear of heights.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.073
Oh... oh, we don't have to
do the balloon ride.

31:13.288 --> 31:15.450
Oh, no, I know.
How about you hit the museum...

31:15.665 --> 31:17.452
Ryan and I will go
in the balloon...

31:17.667 --> 31:19.078
and then we can all meet up
for dinner later.

31:19.294 --> 31:22.412
- Yeah, if you're scared of flying.
- No, I'm not scared. I'm not scared.

31:22.631 --> 31:25.544
It's just airplanes, so I'll go.
I'm going.

31:25.759 --> 31:28.627
- You sure?
- Yeah, absolutely. It'll be an adventure.

31:29.638 --> 31:31.630
All right then... go ballooning.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.589
The ride should last
about an hour.

31:33.767 --> 31:36.305
My brother will follow us
in the chase car.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.762
Make sure all personal
belongings are secure.

31:38.980 --> 31:42.439
Also, for the lovers, we have
cold champagne for purchase.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.517
Okay, any questions?

31:44.736 --> 31:48.605
Um, I don't mean to be rude,
but can you see?

31:48.824 --> 31:53.194
Uh, don't worry, ma'am.
I, uh, see just fine.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.372
Just messing with you.
All right then.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.408
Let's touch the sky!

32:02.796 --> 32:04.378
Here we go!

32:20.856 --> 32:21.892
Yeah!

32:33.994 --> 32:36.611
Wow. Beautiful, isn't it?

32:36.788 --> 32:39.246
St. Louis doesn't look so bad
from up here.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.324
It's pretty spectacular, right?

32:41.543 --> 32:43.330
Yeah, it's really great.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.127
You okay?
You're sweating.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.798
Yeah, no, I'm good.
I'm just... I'm really hot.

32:49.009 --> 32:52.173
It'll be nice and cool when we
hit about 2,000 feet.

32:52.888 --> 32:55.346
- How high are we right now?
- 500.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.767
You, uh, you sure you're okay?

33:00.270 --> 33:01.727
Yes, yes, yes.

33:03.815 --> 33:07.183
No, no, no, no, no!
You get me down right now!

33:07.402 --> 33:08.859
Get me down right now!

33:09.070 --> 33:11.107
Ma'am, ma'am, we gotta go
up to catch the current.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.734
Fuck the fucking current!

33:12.949 --> 33:15.532
- I think she's having a panic attack.
- Oh, great.

33:15.744 --> 33:16.985
She's fine.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.241
Breathe. Breathe.

33:21.583 --> 33:24.371
Find your breath. Look at me.
Find your breath.

33:24.586 --> 33:27.750
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to disappoint you.

33:27.964 --> 33:30.832
Now let's take my hands,
stare into my eyes.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.883
They're... so beautiful.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.837
Like... like a... robin's egg.

33:36.097 --> 33:38.180
Let's sing a song,
you and me, okay?

33:45.065 --> 33:46.522
Is that Pink?

33:46.816 --> 33:48.648
I don't know, it was the first
song that came to my head.

33:48.818 --> 33:51.026
- I kinda like her.
- I like her, too.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.529
- Ready?
- Yeah.

33:56.952 --> 33:59.194
- Oh, jeez.
- Gosh, this is fun.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.574
This is so fucking fun.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.375
- Jeez.
- How much for the champagne?

34:06.586 --> 34:08.498
$100 with tax.
I take credit cards.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.170
Are you insane?
That's a $20 bottle of brut.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.295
You're welcome to shop around.

34:16.513 --> 34:17.924
I'll take the fucking champagne.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.427
Look who has bubbly.

34:21.643 --> 34:24.306
Let's drink some champagne and
really take in this view.

34:24.521 --> 34:27.434
You know, I'm not sure alcohol
is a good idea for her right now.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.062
I wasn't talking about her.
She's fine.

34:30.277 --> 34:32.188
This happens all the time.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.896
Oh, you should go and have fun.

34:35.114 --> 34:37.322
Hey, I am having fun.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.409
Me, too. So much fun.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.829
- Oh, shit! Shit!
- My eye!

34:44.040 --> 34:45.871
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

34:46.835 --> 34:49.918
- Did you hit him in his good eye?
- She hit me in my only eye!

34:50.130 --> 34:51.085
What?!

34:51.297 --> 34:53.255
Here, let me take a look,
let me take a look.

34:53.466 --> 34:56.083
- Is it bad? I can't see.
- Yeah, you got a small cut.

34:56.303 --> 34:57.919
- Oh god, he's crying blood!
- Your pupil is red.

34:58.138 --> 34:59.549
- I don't think it's too serious.
- Shit! Shit!

34:59.723 --> 35:01.339
- There's a little bit of blood.
- Oh my god we're gonna die!

35:01.558 --> 35:04.221
Everybody calm down!
No one's going to die!

35:04.436 --> 35:06.428
We're just gonna have to land
a little early, okay?

35:06.646 --> 35:08.228
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.980
Now, I just gotta ask:
has anybody ever piloted...

35:13.194 --> 35:15.231
a hot air balloon before?

35:17.198 --> 35:18.154
What?

35:18.366 --> 35:21.359
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Calm down! It's gonna be all right!

35:29.919 --> 35:31.626
- Are you okay?
- No!

35:32.797 --> 35:35.084
Oh my god! Oh my god!

35:36.259 --> 35:38.672
Can somebody call
for an ambulance?

35:40.930 --> 35:43.388
Please! Please be quiet!

35:43.642 --> 35:45.634
Shut the fuck up!

35:45.810 --> 35:49.554
Please! Oh my god! Oh my god!

35:52.317 --> 35:53.307
<i>Que pasa?</i>

35:59.532 --> 36:02.195
Hey, how was the balloon ride?
Nice view of the arch, right?

36:02.410 --> 36:03.446
It was great.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.870
I have some good news
from the airlines.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.492
The flight's back on?

36:07.707 --> 36:10.324
No, they found your bag.
I'm so sorry, I should have led with that.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.250
Yes! Thank you, Anuj.

36:12.462 --> 36:14.545
Well, shall we celebrate
being alive?

36:14.756 --> 36:16.338
Honestly, I think
I'm just gonna relax.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.633
I'm gonna go upstairs,
call Florida, maybe hit the pool.

36:19.803 --> 36:22.341
- Oh, I'll join you! I love the pool.
- I'll come with you.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.547
Now that I have a suitcase,
I don't have to go naked.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.590
Maybe I'll just go naked.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.146
Oh my god, I hate myself.

36:36.986 --> 36:38.352
I think I'm ready.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.318
Oh, cute suit.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.150
I'll see you by the pool.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.304
Lacerater.

37:19.821 --> 37:21.778
Can I get two Mai Tai's
over here?

37:32.542 --> 37:33.703
Hey!

37:34.711 --> 37:36.168
This is amazing.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.665
You've got to try it.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.464
It looks very inviting.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.917
I was actually wondering if
you're not doing anything later-

37:43.136 --> 37:46.425
First, I wasn't talking to you,
and second, it's not gonna happen, okay?

37:47.056 --> 37:48.422
Um, this is closed.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.348
And it's not what you think,
that you're not hot enough...

37:50.560 --> 37:52.426
because you're totally hot enough.

37:52.645 --> 37:53.931
I've dated way lower.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.476
This seat is taken.

37:56.691 --> 37:59.729
Guys, leave the seat
next to Meg open.

37:59.903 --> 38:01.439
Come on, scoot.

38:01.654 --> 38:02.861
There you go.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.952
- Seriously? What are you doing?
- Yeah, I don't know.

38:10.163 --> 38:11.119
Hey!

38:13.583 --> 38:16.792
Hey, Ryan!
Look, I snagged us a chair.

38:18.338 --> 38:21.001
Oh my god.
Oh, Jesus mother fu...

38:21.216 --> 38:23.674
Oh... oh my god.
Oh my god, oh...

38:23.885 --> 38:26.298
I think I might just
lay out for a bit.

38:29.432 --> 38:33.392
- Wow, you look great.
- Oh, thanks.

38:35.188 --> 38:36.144
Stop.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.858
See, this is a definition
of "cock block".

38:49.077 --> 38:50.659
I'm really sorry about today.

38:50.870 --> 38:53.704
Thank you so much. I'm really...
I'm embarrassed.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.578
Embarrassed?
I'm the one that sang Pink.

38:57.252 --> 38:59.118
I have the feeling that
that's not the first time...

38:59.337 --> 39:00.794
that you've sang that out loud.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.337
No comment.

39:02.549 --> 39:03.710
Wanna take a dip?

39:03.883 --> 39:05.545
Um, actually I think we're
just gonna hang out here...

39:05.802 --> 39:09.091
- Yeah, I wouldn't mind swimming.
- Yeah, me, too. I'd love to do that.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.841
I'll come, too.

39:15.103 --> 39:17.015
- You don't see that much.
- What?

39:17.188 --> 39:18.850
A hotel pool
you can actually dive in.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.639
We love diving!

39:20.817 --> 39:23.901
- We used to go every summer at your...
- At my dad's houseboat!

39:24.112 --> 39:26.479
You were so nervous to jump
in at first, remember?

39:26.698 --> 39:28.155
You told me there were
piranhas in the lake...

39:28.366 --> 39:30.608
and it freaked me out...
that was so mean of you.

39:30.827 --> 39:32.739
You're just mad 'cause
I always beat you at diving.

39:32.954 --> 39:35.287
That's 'cause your dad was the judge.
I would have won with an impartial jury.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.785
- I was so much better than you.
- That's funny.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.292
Well, you got one now.

39:47.468 --> 39:51.508
Okay, let's start with the basics.
Jack knife.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.602
You call that a jack knife?
That was more like a belly flop.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.975
And deduct points for splash,
that's the Olympic rules.

40:01.316 --> 40:02.272
Got it.

40:02.483 --> 40:05.567
Now, a jack knife...
the right way.

40:05.737 --> 40:06.727
Whoa.

40:08.573 --> 40:09.905
Oh, shit.

40:11.367 --> 40:14.656
Impartial judge gives you
a five... both of you.

40:14.829 --> 40:17.572
Time to step it up, back flip.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.331
Go on, do it.

40:21.544 --> 40:22.500
Okay!

40:27.717 --> 40:29.083
Nice!

40:29.302 --> 40:30.713
That was your best back flip?

40:39.187 --> 40:40.223
What're you doing?

40:42.065 --> 40:43.806
Forward one-and-a-half tuck.

40:45.026 --> 40:46.358
What? What is that?

40:46.527 --> 40:48.439
Are you crazy?
That is so dangerous.

40:48.655 --> 40:51.819
- Still scared, I guess.
- No, I'm not scared. It's gonna kick out.

40:53.159 --> 40:56.323
Okay, fine, go ahead, go ahead,
do what you want.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.325
Front one-and-a-half tuck.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.957
Oh my god.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.005
That hurts.

41:09.008 --> 41:12.376
Meg? Meg, are you all right?

41:12.595 --> 41:15.759
Why are you just sitting
down there? Are you okay?

41:20.561 --> 41:22.848
Meg? Are you coming up?

41:23.648 --> 41:26.186
Meg, are you alive? Meg!

41:47.505 --> 41:48.541
Hi.

41:49.966 --> 41:50.956
Hey.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.960
Are we drinking?

41:56.889 --> 41:58.596
She'll have a Screwdriver.

42:03.438 --> 42:06.226
Not so much ice.
Just three cubes.

42:09.569 --> 42:10.685
Are you okay?

42:10.903 --> 42:11.859
Yeah.

42:12.822 --> 42:15.360
Actually, no. I think I
turned my eyelid inside out.

42:15.575 --> 42:17.316
Oh, there's my girls.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.401
Can I have two Tequila Sunrises?

42:19.620 --> 42:21.031
Did you hear the weather report?

42:21.247 --> 42:22.954
They said that the hurricane
has passed through...

42:23.166 --> 42:25.909
so you two might get a little
beach time after all.

42:26.669 --> 42:27.625
Great.

42:27.795 --> 42:28.911
Ah, great.

42:29.130 --> 42:31.213
Yeah, a few days of a time share
isn't as good as a week...

42:31.424 --> 42:34.417
but you know,
I'll take what I can get.

42:34.844 --> 42:37.507
I'm not gonna see Roger
again for a month.

42:37.722 --> 42:40.339
- Is he traveling?
- Back to the wife and kids.

42:41.559 --> 42:44.393
- Thank you.
- I-I'm sorry, back to where?

42:44.604 --> 42:46.687
Roger's married, just not to me.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.434
You were celebrating
your anniversary.

42:48.649 --> 42:49.685
Of a love affair.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.107
Fuck you, don't judge me.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.279
'Cause I don't like that.
'Cause let me tell you something.

42:56.491 --> 42:59.655
I am a lady
who demands perfection, okay?

42:59.869 --> 43:02.737
Is it fair to his wife? No.
Is it fair to his kids?

43:03.206 --> 43:04.287
No.

43:04.499 --> 43:05.706
I don't care.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.580
Because I would do anything
for Roger.

43:08.753 --> 43:10.540
I would die for that man.

43:11.714 --> 43:13.421
- Wow.
- It's true. I'd kill for him.

43:14.092 --> 43:15.879
I'd kill his family,
I'd kill his wife.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.336
Anybody got in my way, I'd kill 'em.
Right there. Kill 'em.

43:18.554 --> 43:20.671
I'd kill you, I'd kill you,
I'd kill everyone.

43:20.890 --> 43:24.054
And I know how to do it, too,
'cause my brother's a Navy Seal.

43:26.562 --> 43:28.269
- I'm just kidding!
- Oh...

43:31.275 --> 43:34.063
It was a joke.
But seriously, you know?

43:34.278 --> 43:37.362
Sometimes you just gotta
take what you want, whatever the cost.

43:37.573 --> 43:39.656
Because at the end of the day,
nobody gives a shit...

43:39.867 --> 43:42.325
whether you're happy or not,
you know what I'm sayin'?

43:42.537 --> 43:44.574
You can put their drinks
on my tab.

43:47.625 --> 43:48.957
Thanks for everything, guys.

43:56.926 --> 43:58.212
- Ryan!
- Ryan!

43:58.427 --> 43:59.918
- No, no, no!
- Wait! Wait up!

44:02.390 --> 44:04.507
- Oh, hey!
- There he is.

44:04.725 --> 44:05.932
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

44:06.144 --> 44:08.386
I, uh, was actually
looking for you two.

44:08.604 --> 44:10.687
Oh, well,
look and you shall find.

44:10.857 --> 44:12.894
Yeah, I wanted to see you guys
before I left.

44:13.109 --> 44:15.351
There's my road buddy.
Hey.

44:15.570 --> 44:17.152
- Ladies.
- Hi.

44:17.363 --> 44:18.729
- How's your eye, Meg?
- It's fine.

44:18.948 --> 44:21.190
- It looks a little...
- You're leaving now?

44:21.409 --> 44:22.820
Yeah, didn't you see
the weather report?

44:23.035 --> 44:24.867
Our flight's gonna be back
on any moment.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.116
I'm out of time. I just,
you know, can't take the chance.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.698
If we drive through the night,
I can get you to Fort by morning.

44:29.917 --> 44:30.998
What fort?

44:31.210 --> 44:33.042
Oh, local speak,
Fort Lauderdale.

44:33.254 --> 44:35.667
You're going on a road trip
with a complete stranger?

44:35.882 --> 44:38.545
He could be a serial killer
for all you know.

44:38.759 --> 44:40.250
I'm not a serial killer.

44:40.469 --> 44:43.007
That's exactly what
a serial killer would say.

44:43.222 --> 44:45.339
You're something, you know that?
Let's hit the road.

44:45.558 --> 44:48.642
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Serial killer. That's great.

44:48.811 --> 44:50.928
Awesome meeting you both.

44:52.481 --> 44:53.847
- Bye.
- Bye.

44:58.905 --> 44:59.895
All right.

45:01.449 --> 45:03.065
Yeah, okay.

45:07.163 --> 45:08.745
- Bye.
- Wait!

45:10.208 --> 45:12.291
- Got room for one more?
- Oh, shit.

45:12.501 --> 45:13.912
I'll just be one minute.

45:14.962 --> 45:17.079
Hey, you know what?
Make that... make that two!

45:17.298 --> 45:19.130
I'll be right back, okay?

45:21.844 --> 45:24.507
I can't help it.
I love fucked up women.

45:34.899 --> 45:36.561
I gotta say,
I did not see this coming.

45:36.734 --> 45:38.896
A little company,
a little conversation.

45:39.111 --> 45:40.898
Usually I'd just be
blasting my tunes.

45:41.113 --> 45:42.775
Uh, by the way, are you guys
on Google Plus?

45:42.990 --> 45:44.276
- No.
- No, I'm on Tinder.

45:44.492 --> 45:46.734
Well, get on it. We should all
be in each other's circles.

45:46.953 --> 45:48.945
- How long is the drive?
- Oh, it'll be no time at all.

45:49.163 --> 45:51.450
I know all the back ways.
Uh, 17 hours?

45:52.083 --> 45:55.042
I've got a million songs on this thing,
so we're all covered on music.

45:55.253 --> 45:59.122
Right now we're listening
to the "south on I-24 mix".

45:59.340 --> 46:01.206
Please wait four songs
before complaining.

46:01.842 --> 46:04.880
This is gonna be fun.
Seven hours, no sweat.

46:05.096 --> 46:06.507
Seventeen.

46:06.722 --> 46:07.803
Oh.

46:10.476 --> 46:12.968
I'm going to Fort Lauderdale
and I'm bringing an apple...

46:13.187 --> 46:17.272
a banana, an egg, a frog,
a um...

46:17.483 --> 46:19.190
griffon, a haberdasher,

46:19.402 --> 46:22.566
an icicle, a jackalope,
and a knight.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.772
Ha! It was "k",
and you're an English teacher!

46:24.991 --> 46:26.948
No, it is "k", it's "k",
like a knight in shining armor.

46:27.159 --> 46:29.617
I'm going to Fort Lauderdale
and I'm bringing an apple...

46:29.829 --> 46:32.412
a banana, a Chihuahua,
a dolphin, an egg, a frog...

46:32.623 --> 46:35.240
a griffon, a haberdasher,
an icicle, a jackalope...

46:35.459 --> 46:37.325
a knight, and a labradoodle.

46:37.545 --> 46:39.377
- Meg, it's your turn!
- Nice work!

46:39.588 --> 46:42.126
Okay, I'm going to Fort Lauderdale
and I hate this fucking game.

46:47.388 --> 46:48.924
- Gin.
- Son of a bitch.

46:49.140 --> 46:51.427
- You know what? I wanna sit in the back.
- I'd hate me, too.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.474
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no switching!
- It's my turn!

46:53.686 --> 46:56.144
- No, no, hey, hey, no switching!
- What're you doing?

46:56.355 --> 46:58.347
- Get back in the front.
- Just get right there.

46:58.566 --> 47:00.649
Go, so I can sit here!

47:00.860 --> 47:02.226
- What're you doing?
- It's my turn!

47:06.574 --> 47:08.190
- Hey.
- Thank you.

47:10.578 --> 47:13.070
They always put
too much ice in this.

47:15.041 --> 47:17.203
Ah, what're you doing?

47:17.418 --> 47:19.000
Come on.

47:28.179 --> 47:32.139
Oh my god. Oh my god,
did you seriously do that?

47:32.350 --> 47:34.808
That is disgusting.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.635
- Oh my god. Open the window!
- Come on, dude!

47:36.854 --> 47:38.766
For God's sakes!
That is disgusting!

48:11.097 --> 48:13.384
- It smells nice.
- It's lavender.

48:13.599 --> 48:16.717
It's great for dry skin.
Not that you have any.

48:18.229 --> 48:19.595
Feels good.

48:20.272 --> 48:23.356
Minerals, essential vitamins,
and extracts.

48:23.567 --> 48:25.024
Also a shit ton of honey.

48:25.236 --> 48:27.148
It's like sticking your hand
in a beehive.

48:27.613 --> 48:29.149
Careful, don't get stung.

48:30.074 --> 48:31.315
Oh my god.

48:31.534 --> 48:33.025
- What?
- It's from Meg's mom.

48:33.244 --> 48:35.076
I texted her to wish her
a happy birthday and...

48:35.287 --> 48:36.323
It's not her birthday.

48:36.539 --> 48:38.201
She sent me this photo of when
we were in high school.

48:38.416 --> 48:39.577
What photo?

48:39.792 --> 48:42.409
Oh my god.
When is this from?

48:42.628 --> 48:45.666
- It's, uh, prom.
- What is that on your head?

48:45.840 --> 48:47.797
- It's um... It's a helmet.
- It's nothing, it's just a hat.

48:48.008 --> 48:51.376
- It's a protective helmet... for her skull.
- Uh, may I see?

48:51.595 --> 48:53.461
Oh, yeah,
my nephew had one of those...

48:53.681 --> 48:56.389
when he was three and a half months old,
'cause his head was shaped like...

48:56.600 --> 48:58.512
a zucchini and they were
trying to reshape it.

48:58.686 --> 49:01.099
- Was your head shaped like a zucchini?
- No, I just had migraines.

49:01.313 --> 49:04.556
She had this really rare condition.
It was, um, what was it?

49:04.775 --> 49:07.108
- It was complex...
- Complex chiari malformation.

49:07.319 --> 49:09.982
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.
Malformation. It was horrible.

49:10.197 --> 49:11.938
The kids just called her
horrible names.

49:12.158 --> 49:14.070
She wore the thing for six
months. It was terrible.

49:14.285 --> 49:16.572
That sucks. Man, kids can
be so mean, you know?

49:16.787 --> 49:17.948
Yeah.

49:21.167 --> 49:22.283
Scrotum head.

49:23.711 --> 49:26.078
Reservoir tip.
Captain Retard.

49:26.297 --> 49:28.004
Soft-skull Smurf...

49:28.215 --> 49:30.548
It was horrible.
I just tried to be there for her, though.

49:30.759 --> 49:32.295
No matter what the kids
called her.

49:32.511 --> 49:34.377
Well, she's lucky to have you
as a friend.

49:34.597 --> 49:37.340
I actually feel really lucky
because her struggles...

49:37.558 --> 49:41.177
really, they inspired me to...
to teach special needs kids...

49:41.395 --> 49:43.682
so... so, thank you, Meg.

49:43.898 --> 49:45.309
Oh yeah.

49:48.652 --> 49:51.395
Scrotum head...
That's pretty good.

50:15.930 --> 50:18.673
- I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.
- You guys want something to drink?

50:18.891 --> 50:20.757
- I'm buyin'.
- Oh, I'm good.

50:22.436 --> 50:24.098
Oh, I'm good, too.

50:28.609 --> 50:30.350
Oh... hi.

50:31.654 --> 50:34.567
- Hi, how are you today?
- Oh, not bad.

50:35.533 --> 50:37.365
Oh, yeah, thank you.

50:41.622 --> 50:42.988
Oh my god.

50:46.544 --> 50:47.785
Oh my god.

50:52.883 --> 50:54.090
Oh god.

51:25.082 --> 51:26.948
Occupied!

51:37.595 --> 51:39.052
Okay.

51:49.773 --> 51:51.605
Meg, is that you?

51:51.775 --> 51:53.687
It's Scrotum head, bitch.

51:53.902 --> 51:54.983
Hello?

51:57.906 --> 52:02.526
Hello? There's an unsafe
level of feces in here!

52:06.165 --> 52:07.326
Hey.

52:08.917 --> 52:13.082
Listen, Kate may be a while.
She's having an issue.

52:13.505 --> 52:14.586
Everything okay?

52:14.798 --> 52:18.462
Unusually heavy flow.
Don't say anything.

52:18.677 --> 52:21.215
I would normally never tell you,
but she'd be mortified...

52:21.430 --> 52:23.262
if everyone thought
it was the diarrhea.

52:23.474 --> 52:25.431
That's mostly cleared up.

52:26.393 --> 52:28.555
Okay, well, we'll just wait.

52:31.315 --> 52:34.899
Look what I got,
the most expensive of the two.

52:35.110 --> 52:36.271
Good idea.

53:01.428 --> 53:02.589
It's crazy, isn't it?

53:02.763 --> 53:05.096
We've only known each other
for a few days...

53:05.808 --> 53:09.142
and yet I feel like
I've known you my whole life.

53:09.353 --> 53:11.219
Well, you know,
we've been stopping a lot.

53:11.397 --> 53:12.933
We'll pick up the pace.
You know...

53:13.148 --> 53:16.016
Sorry, I gotta take this.
Hey, you maniac!

53:16.235 --> 53:18.192
Yeah, yeah man,
I'm just outside Valdosta...

53:18.404 --> 53:20.145
I should be getting
in about 10:00.

53:20.364 --> 53:22.447
Yeah. You guys having fun?

53:23.951 --> 53:25.658
Get... Fucking bumblebee!

53:26.245 --> 53:28.362
- Jesus.
- Everyone wants a bite of that guy.

53:28.580 --> 53:30.492
There's not really honey
in the hand cream.

53:30.708 --> 53:32.324
Hey. Yeah, uh, sorry. No.

53:32.543 --> 53:35.251
- Gassed up and ready to roll.
- Good for you.

53:35.713 --> 53:37.045
Where's Kate? We should hit it.

53:37.256 --> 53:38.918
- Calm down.
- I am calm.

53:39.133 --> 53:40.999
I just thought we were trying
to make it to a wedding.

53:41.218 --> 53:42.800
That's why I've been speeding
the whole time.

53:43.011 --> 53:45.549
67? That's your idea
of speeding?

53:46.557 --> 53:50.517
Traditionally, when someone
does you a favor, you say "thank you".

53:50.728 --> 53:52.264
Well, I'm a rebel.

53:52.479 --> 53:54.516
Just keep me posted.
Okay, buddy.

53:55.274 --> 53:56.264
Ryan!

53:57.818 --> 53:59.935
Ryan, is everything okay?

54:00.279 --> 54:02.862
Uh, yeah, yeah.
These guys are animals.

54:03.073 --> 54:05.781
- We'll leave it at that.
- Awesome.

54:05.993 --> 54:09.782
Anyway, I was thinking,
I'm not gonna have much to do.

54:09.997 --> 54:12.489
Kate's obsessed with looking
for shells on the beach...

54:12.708 --> 54:16.497
so after you finish the wedding stuff
and maybe you wanna hook up...

54:16.712 --> 54:19.671
or even if you need a date,
I brought a dress.

54:19.882 --> 54:21.339
It's really more...

54:22.342 --> 54:23.674
Oh my god!

54:26.013 --> 54:29.506
- Are you okay? What happened?
- What happened?!

54:30.267 --> 54:33.180
Someone locked me in the bathroom!
That's what happened!

54:33.395 --> 54:36.263
- Why? Who would do that?
- That homeless guy.

54:36.482 --> 54:38.314
You know what?
I smelled meth on him.

54:38.525 --> 54:40.767
Guys, what is taking so...
Oh my god!

54:40.986 --> 54:42.818
Are... are you okay?

54:43.030 --> 54:44.566
Oh... you got something on your...

54:48.368 --> 54:49.904
Where are we?

54:50.120 --> 54:51.452
I think that's poop.

54:57.920 --> 54:59.502
Don't touch me!

54:59.713 --> 55:01.079
I wasn't going to.

55:05.010 --> 55:06.717
Motherfucker!

55:08.639 --> 55:10.551
Oh my god!

55:31.829 --> 55:33.365
- Oh, god.
- You okay?

55:33.872 --> 55:36.080
Yeah, it's just... my neck.

55:36.291 --> 55:38.374
I think I tweaked it
when I fell.

55:38.585 --> 55:41.077
- Here, come here.
- Oh yeah, sure. Thank you.

55:42.089 --> 55:43.421
- Right here?
- Yeah.

55:43.632 --> 55:45.874
Here, just... right there.

55:53.225 --> 55:54.557
Oh yeah.

55:55.727 --> 55:58.094
Oh god yeah, right there...

55:58.689 --> 56:01.523
Oh, oh my god, that is so good.

56:01.733 --> 56:04.020
Yeah, you got a big knot
right here.

56:04.236 --> 56:07.400
Oh yeah.
Oh! That's awesome.

56:08.365 --> 56:10.607
Jesus, you two, get a room.

56:10.826 --> 56:12.112
Finally.

56:16.331 --> 56:17.617
Sorry you hurt your neck.

56:17.958 --> 56:19.620
Yeah, I bet you are.

56:19.835 --> 56:22.202
I am. Want a sip?

56:22.421 --> 56:24.208
It might help loosen
up your neck.

56:24.590 --> 56:27.298
- No, thank you.
- Nah, me neither.

56:27.509 --> 56:30.547
That's what I get for traveling
with a bunch of stiffs.

56:31.430 --> 56:33.217
What're you doing? Stop!

56:35.434 --> 56:38.051
- You don't know me.
- I know you're the driver.

56:46.361 --> 56:47.772
I thought you were a rebel.

56:52.784 --> 56:54.867
- How much do you weigh?
- What?

56:55.913 --> 56:58.121
You've been driving for a while.
Want me to tap in?

56:58.332 --> 57:00.790
Look, I'm on the road like six,
seven days a month.

57:01.001 --> 57:03.084
A haul like this
is nothing to me.

57:03.295 --> 57:05.958
Just get some sleep.
Everything's fine.

57:30.530 --> 57:32.066
Are you insane?!

57:32.282 --> 57:35.320
Okay! We're okay. We're okay.
What'd that sign say?

57:54.638 --> 57:55.719
Are you insane?

58:01.395 --> 58:03.682
I'm screwed, man.
I'm really fucking screwed.

58:03.897 --> 58:08.062
- I'm not gonna make the wedding.
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are, bucko.

58:08.568 --> 58:09.979
- When is it?
- Tomorrow.

58:10.278 --> 58:11.268
Oh.

58:12.489 --> 58:14.151
Oh, geez, I feel weird.

58:16.368 --> 58:17.484
- Help you?
- Yeah...

58:17.703 --> 58:19.114
the, uh, headlamps
are out on our car.

58:19.329 --> 58:20.865
- Is there a garage in town?
- Yeah.

58:21.081 --> 58:22.822
You think the guy could open up
and maybe take a look?

58:23.041 --> 58:25.158
- Oh, no, I doubt it.
- Can we rent a car?

58:25.377 --> 58:26.834
- Sure.
- Now?

58:27.045 --> 58:29.287
- Oh, oh, no. Not tonight.
- Tomorrow?

58:29.506 --> 58:32.214
- How long will it take us to get a car?
- I ate one of those um...

58:32.426 --> 58:33.837
Well, it'd have to come
from the airport.

58:34.052 --> 58:35.759
- I think they open around 8:00.
- Uh, you know.

58:35.971 --> 58:37.382
Would they deliver it here?

58:37.597 --> 58:40.055
I don't know. Maybe. No.

58:40.934 --> 58:42.345
Can we borrow your car?

58:42.561 --> 58:44.393
- It was at the gas station...
- No.

58:44.604 --> 58:47.438
- And when you don't use bread...
- Okay, well, shit.

58:47.649 --> 58:50.187
Nothing we can do tonight.
Uh, we'll take two rooms.

58:50.402 --> 58:51.643
I think it starts with a "T".

58:51.862 --> 58:53.945
Uh, three rooms, actually.
I'd like my own room.

58:54.156 --> 58:56.148
- Three rooms.
- Okay, even if we cab it to the airport...

58:56.366 --> 58:58.358
we could be on the road
by maybe 9:30-10:00.

58:58.577 --> 59:01.695
There you go. This one's out the door,
up the stairs, to the right.

59:01.872 --> 59:04.080
There's a restaurant out back
towards the interstate.

59:04.291 --> 59:06.123
- You can walk it.
- All right.

59:06.334 --> 59:08.667
It's... open 'til 10:00.

59:08.837 --> 59:10.920
I'm wanna get this guy in bed.

59:11.131 --> 59:13.043
I'll, uh, park the car later on.

59:13.258 --> 59:15.420
You know, for food poisoning,
this ain't bad.

59:16.344 --> 59:17.676
Goodnight.

59:27.731 --> 59:29.017
See ya.

59:29.232 --> 59:30.313
Yeah.

59:31.985 --> 59:35.149
He's yours, okay? He's yours.

59:35.947 --> 59:37.859
I don't want him.

59:38.075 --> 59:40.283
I just didn't want you
to have him.

59:54.508 --> 59:55.464
Oh, hey.

59:56.718 --> 59:58.084
Don't be so excited.

59:59.262 --> 01:00:00.423
Where's Ryan?

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:05.179
On the phone, wedding stuff,
thought I'd give him some space.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:08.768
You okay?

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:12.352
Yeah. Yeah.
Just got quite the buzz going on.

01:00:12.567 --> 01:00:14.354
Thought some alcohol
would add nicely to it.

01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:16.902
Hey, can I get a shot of Turkey?
Thanks.

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:23.363
I'm gonna go play some pool.

01:00:23.578 --> 01:00:25.490
You can sit next to me.

01:00:25.705 --> 01:00:28.072
You sure?
I don't wanna give you cooties.

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:37.670
Look at that handsome guy
with that hag.

01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:44.631
Two smiles in one night.
I'm on my game.

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:50.394
Finally getting your ice.

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:54.516
I hate ice, it hurts my teeth.

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:56.187
Oh.

01:00:57.779 --> 01:00:59.395
Where's, uh...

01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:02.482
She's at the bar.
She's probably waiting for you.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.117
Goodnight.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.660
Wait.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.957
What're you doing?

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:14.873
You two were always together.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.249
I'm gonna kiss your mouth now.

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:20.916
Okay.

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:35.522
Wow.

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:38.025
Oh, I know. It's crooked.

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:41.271
- Was it, like, an accident or something?
- No, no, just kinda born that way.

01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:44.072
I've been told that
it enhances the experience.

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:45.650
Right.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.782
All right, here we go!
Here we go!

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.334
Oh, it's good, isn't it?

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.874
Mary, mother of God!

01:01:58.673 --> 01:02:02.041
- You okay?
- Yeah, just gonna do one thing.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.756
Okay. Oh, shit. That's okay.

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:07.634
Here, let me just try...
Oh yeah, that's better!

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:15.392
You okay?

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:17.394
You know,
we don't have to do this.

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:20.644
Yes. We. Do.

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:29.569
Oh! Here we go!

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:37.710
Yes!

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:42.665
Long story short,
that is how I became a jeweler.

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:45.627
Screw you, Dad. Right?

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:50.844
Okay.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.846
I give up.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:56.470
What?

01:02:57.357 --> 01:03:01.067
You know, I carry all kinds
of gemstones in my store.

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:02.644
Hundreds.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:06.230
Precious, semi-precious,
uncut, faceted.

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:08.653
Every time a woman walks
into my store...

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:11.360
all she wants is one thing...
diamonds.

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:13.411
Don't get me wrong,
I love diamonds...

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.865
but there are so many other
stones out there...

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:18.326
with such amazing qualities.

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:22.209
Imperial jade, the texture
of a jacinth stone...

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:25.792
the way, if you add just the
smallest amount of iron to amethyst...

01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:28.924
it produces the truest shade
of violet you've ever seen.

01:03:36.604 --> 01:03:38.846
I'm the imperial jade,
in case that wasn't clear.

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:41.728
- No, I got it.
- All right, too much bourbon.

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:44.185
Gotta go. 'Night.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:50.320
Spear of butter, a little bit
of cinnamon on a King's Hawaiian...

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:52.322
is the ultimate comfort food.

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.119
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.823
- Mind if I join you?
- Shut up.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:59.454
This raisin bran is amazing,
by the way. You should get some.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.080
What's with you?

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:03.625
Nothing.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:07.416
We have to stop. This is insane.

01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:10.252
You're the most important person
in my life.

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:11.838
You know that, right?

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:15.425
I'm not gonna throw that away
for some doofus.

01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:17.509
I mean, geez, right?

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:21.268
He's cute and everything,
but there's not much more there...

01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:24.442
than killer abs and a bent dick.
Look into young Ryan's eyes...

01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:26.814
and I have serious doubt that
there's anyone home.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.862
There you guys are.
I was knocking on your doors.

01:04:29.074 --> 01:04:30.656
- Not now, Craig.
- Ryan's gone.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.988
- What?
- Yeah, he stole my car.

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:34.319
Are you serious?

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:36.199
What is the matter with you?

01:04:36.414 --> 01:04:38.701
- What's the matter with you?!
- You told me that I could have him!

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:40.579
That is what you said to me
and then you went and you...

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:42.251
- slept with him anyway?!
- No, I...

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:43.794
How do you know he has
a bent dick?!

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:45.496
- What?!
- You slept with Ryan.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:48.416
You are unbelievable, Meg.
I am done with you!

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:50.968
- I am so done...
- Wait a second, we are not done...

01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:52.715
and how do you know
he has a bent dick?

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:55.799
Because I spent the night
with him, Einstein!

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:59.430
Whoa, whoa!

01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:01.394
- That was a kill shot!
- What?

01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:04.349
I take Krav Maga at the Y!
That was a straight up kill shot!

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:08.607
You took a fucking kill shot at me?!
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:10.609
I didn't mean to take a kill
shot, are you okay?

01:05:10.824 --> 01:05:12.235
No, I'm not okay!

01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:15.776
- I hate you!
- Okay, maybe we should...

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:17.327
I hate you!

01:05:17.539 --> 01:05:19.451
Will you grow up?!

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:22.374
Me grow up?
I paid for this trip!

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:24.664
- Ouch! Stop!
- I paid for everything!

01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:26.295
You didn't pay for this breakfast!

01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:29.089
It's a continental! It's free!

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:32.377
Oh god, just once I wish you
would say "I am so sorry."

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:35.713
"I am dead broke again, would
you please pay for my fro-yo?"

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.924
For you, it's just a bunch
of heaped-on toppings!

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:39.384
Why do you even bother
with the yogurt?

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:41.389
Why don't you just go
to a fucking candy store?

01:05:41.563 --> 01:05:44.601
- Is there anything you're not afraid of?
- You think you are so strong.

01:05:44.816 --> 01:05:47.524
You quit everything that you try
or you do something stupid...

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:49.897
to make sure that you fail.
You are the coward!

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:52.321
I'm a coward? That's rich.

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:01.155
Had enough?

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:07.832
Oh, shit.

01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:15.756
Freeze, lesbians.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:21.641
Okay, I've gotten statements...

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.473
from the witnesses
and the motel owner.

01:06:23.688 --> 01:06:25.270
From what I gather,
the altercation appears...

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:27.599
to be over a man that you've
both been intimate with?

01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:29.858
- Not at the same time.
- I was first.

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:32.690
Okay, the fella who stole your car.
What was his name?

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:34.568
He didn't steal my car,
he left a note.

01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:37.609
I overreacted when I said that.
He didn't steal my car.

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:39.864
Okay. What was his name?

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:41.908
Uh, Ryan... Ryan...

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:44.206
Ryan, um...

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:47.710
You had sexual relations with this man
and you don't even know his name?

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:50.379
I didn't have... relations...

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:53.298
The desk clerk said you came in
last night with the damaged car.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.297
Officer, I have no memory of it.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.253
I'm still gonna need
the other fella's name.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:01.182
Oh, he accepted my Google Plus request.
I'll show you a picture of this guy.

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:03.634
I'll show you his name,
his likes, his dislikes...

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.515
That would have been helpful.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:06.891
Oh.

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:11.024
Well, he's definitely
going to a wedding.

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:13.693
His own.

01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:16.397
- He's getting married?
- Oh my god!

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:18.198
You two are having a bad day.

01:07:18.826 --> 01:07:20.362
- Officer!
- Sit down!

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:25.077
There is a woman out there
who's about to give her life over...

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:27.704
to a liar and a cheat
and we have the opportunity...

01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:30.127
to stop him and to save her,
so please...

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:32.580
I appeal to you,
not as a police officer...

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:34.506
but as a woman, please.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:37.084
And we'll pay for all
the damage. Everything.

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:41.467
Please?

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:47.304
- You called for a cab?
- We're going to the Fort.

01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:50.018
- Where?
- Fort Lauderdale.

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:52.725
Seriously?
That's gonna cost you.

01:07:52.944 --> 01:07:54.810
Well, we're just gonna
put it on my credit card.

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:58.106
- We can split it three ways.
- No, I'll find my way home.

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:00.441
Are you sure?
You don't wanna see how this thing ends?

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.026
No, I really don't.

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:04.907
Come on!
Let's go ruin a wedding!

01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:13.204
Let's go!

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:32.439
Hey, ladies, we're almost there.

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:37.774
- Game face. Game face!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:57.376
Excuse me, hi.
Um, the wedding, we're a little late...

01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:59.424
but can you tell us
where the wedding is, please?

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.252
There's a wedding in Ballroom H.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:02.928
- Ballroom H, thank you, thank you.
- Just off the lobby.

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:07.470
- There she is. Stop!
- Listen! Listen to us!

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:10.348
- You're making a mistake, don't do it!
- You're making a mistake.

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:12.770
Look, I know
you don't know who we are...

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:15.474
but I slept with your future husband.

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:17.684
We both did, last night...

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:19.566
but we did not know that
he was getting married.

01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:21.647
He lied to us and
he will lie to you.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:23.778
- What have I been...
- Shut up, Dad!

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.279
You deserve better.

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:32.245
You're a piece of shit, Carlos!

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:35.835
Carlos?

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:39.965
- I feel bad about that.
- That was bad. That was on us.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:43.340
Hi. Would there possibly
be another wedding...

01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:44.840
at this hotel right now?

01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:51.935
Shit! We missed it!

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:54.896
Son of a bitch went Asian.

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:58.776
I'm not being racist,
I was just surprised.

01:09:58.986 --> 01:10:00.102
There he is!

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.326
Let's go!

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:14.537
Hey, Karen.

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:19.417
Sorry!

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:32.930
Hey, how're you doing?
You look beautiful.

01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:34.887
- What're you doing here?!
- You lying, fucking...

01:10:35.106 --> 01:10:36.688
piece of bent dick shit!

01:10:39.193 --> 01:10:40.354
Okay, okay!

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:43.525
You're pissed off, but please,
please do not screw up my...

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.732
Hey, you guys. Thank you
so much for coming.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:48.158
It's great seeing you.

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:50.702
You lied to us, asshole!
You took advantage of us!

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:53.621
I liked you.
I flew in a hot air balloon for you!

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:56.621
- I concussed myself for you!
- Hold the fuck on!

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:58.293
You two were throwing
yourselves at me...

01:10:58.504 --> 01:10:59.870
from the minute
I got on that plane.

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.830
That was a game, right? I mean,
you two were trying to prove...

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:03.290
I don't know what you were
trying to prove.

01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:06.468
But it sure as shit
had nothing to do with me.

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:09.088
So, we kinda cancel
each other out.

01:11:09.307 --> 01:11:11.390
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:14.184
Oh, that was the most
beautiful ceremony.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:16.011
Thank you so much, Meemaw.

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:18.142
These are my friends,
Meg and Kate.

01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:20.474
Oh. I'm sorry to
break in like that.

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:23.936
Vernon! Would you excuse us
for just one minute?

01:11:24.155 --> 01:11:27.523
Vern, tell Ryan what you said.

01:11:28.075 --> 01:11:30.192
Shit. Is he right?

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.201
Yeah.

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:36.581
- Wait! Right?
- Yeah!

01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:40.036
- It was beautiful, wasn't it?
- Sorry, excuse us for just one minute.

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:41.290
Sorry.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.915
You got married
ten minutes ago...

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.046
and you slept with
two different women last night?

01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:49.548
- What is wrong with you?
- I know. I'm an asshole, I know.

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:51.721
Asshole? It's like biblically
more than that.

01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:53.674
I want to punch you
in the mouth.

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:55.680
Will you just listen to me
for one second?

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:58.012
I have been with Genevieve since
freshman year of college...

01:11:58.231 --> 01:12:01.269
and hopefully I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life with that woman.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:02.941
But freshman year.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.485
And two girls like you?
You're like every guy's dream.

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:07.028
I know you're not gonna
believe this...

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.573
but nothing like this has ever
happened to me before.

01:12:09.784 --> 01:12:12.151
- Yeah, okay. You... you lied to us.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:15.613
Why didn't you tell us that you
were the one who was getting married?

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:17.619
I didn't lie to you.
You never asked.

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:21.994
Please don't destroy my wedding.

01:12:22.213 --> 01:12:24.705
Ryan. What're you doing?

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:25.997
Hey!

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:28.584
- Aren't you wearing a watch?
- Yeah, I...

01:12:28.803 --> 01:12:32.638
Hon, I said 5:50.
Not 6:00, not 6:05.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:34.306
- I'm sorry.
- What is this?

01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:36.474
Oh, I-I was just doing a...

01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:40.433
Seriously, Ryan?

01:12:40.648 --> 01:12:44.312
Hi. I'm Genevieve.
And you are...?

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:46.268
Gen, this is, uh, Meg and Kate.

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:48.479
They were on the plane with me.
I told you. We, uh, drove down together.

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:50.439
Oh, wow. You guys have been
through such an ordeal.

01:12:50.658 --> 01:12:52.445
Yeah, you have no idea.

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.617
Well, thank you for
returning him to me safely.

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:56.786
I was spazzing.

01:12:57.582 --> 01:12:59.824
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- It stretches out the material.

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:03.251
Oh, that...
that'll come right out.

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:05.875
- I think it's the ham coquette.
- Did you talk to your parents?

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:09.504
- I'm on my way.
- No, I'll do it.

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:13.429
Do you think you can make it
to the garden by yourself?

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:14.846
Yeah.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:19.059
Sorry, we were supposed to start
photos seven minutes ago.

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:22.183
- Um, are you two...
- What?

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:23.434
Staying?

01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:28.269
No, no, I think we just...
We-we just came to um...

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:30.228
- To see your dress.
- Oh, the dress!

01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:31.734
- I love it.
- Oh, yeah, no.

01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:33.611
- It's Christopher Perry.
- It's so gorgeous.

01:13:33.784 --> 01:13:35.696
It was his idea,
he came here to design it.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:38.620
- I hope I can do it justice.
- Are you kidding me?

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:41.824
I think that justice is very
well served, right, Meg?

01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:43.079
Absolutely.

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:45.911
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.957
- Ryan?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:52.303 --> 01:13:53.464
Wow.

01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:56.171
Oh my god.

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:58.882
- That was...
- Karma's a bitch.

01:14:00.019 --> 01:14:01.385
Ryan!

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.063
I think our work here is done.

01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:09.188
Well, it looks like a nice one.

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:11.899
Yeah, not bad.

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:16.695
We have almost four hours
'til our flight.

01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:18.948
You wanna go mess up
another wedding?

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:21.162
Go to the beach?

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:24.411
What do you wanna do?

01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:36.094
Pardon me, I'm in the market
for a precious stone.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:39.218
Something lesser known,
perhaps a nice zinc?

01:14:40.267 --> 01:14:42.179
Zinc's not a stone,
it's an element.

01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:46.597
I know it's not a stone.
I was being poetic. Jesus.

01:14:46.774 --> 01:14:50.267
Well what, are you, stalking me
to bust my balls?

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:53.650
No, I... Fuck!

01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:55.651
Can we start again?

01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:59.739
Hello, Craig, I'm an asshole.

01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:02.654
You were trying to be nice
to me and I was rude...

01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:06.116
and condescending and I didn't
even give you a chance.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.122
And I didn't want to walk
away from this...

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.670
whole fucked-up trip
without telling you that.

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:13.499
Okay. Thanks.

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:15.467
Okay, bye.

01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:19.839
Wait, that's it?

01:15:20.057 --> 01:15:23.550
That's all I had planned.
I'm trying to be responsible.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:25.726
This is new for me.

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:29.147
Okay, well... take care, Meg.

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:34.982
What the hell.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:37.322
How about this?

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.616
Yeah, that works, too.

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:50.369
Bye, Craig.

01:15:57.261 --> 01:15:58.547
Who was that?

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:02.509
Well, now I'm not so sure.

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:09.016
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:11.268
I was starting to get worried
about you.

01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:13.020
- Did you find him?
- Yeah.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.105
How'd it go?

01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:18.280
- I did most of the talking.
- Well, good.

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:20.357
At least you got it
all out there.

01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:23.242
Almost.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:30.451
I don't think we can live
together anymore.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.003
It's me. I'm a mess.

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:36.502
I need to get my shit together.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:41.382
And I can't, if I keep letting
you bail me out of everything.

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:45.799
You're too good to me.
I don't know why...

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:49.477
'cause I can be a real asshole
to you sometimes.

01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:54.023
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we are now
boarding flight</i> 770 <i>to Seattle.</i>

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:56.480
<i>Please have your
boarding passes ready.</i>

01:17:03.702 --> 01:17:04.738
This doesn't mean...

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:06.411
- that we won't see each other.
- No, of course not.

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.113
You're the most important
person in my life.

01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:09.573
You are, too,
ever since fifth grade.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:12.375
- We'll see each other as much as ever.
- Probably more. Yeah.

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:16.163
Okay. Yeah.

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:30.181
Wait. You're an amazing person,
and you always have been.

01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:33.017
I've always wanted
to be more like you.

01:17:34.233 --> 01:17:36.646
If anything,
I rely on you too much.

01:17:47.746 --> 01:17:49.738
I always cry at transitions.

01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:09.432
Miss Jeffries!

01:18:09.643 --> 01:18:12.807
Oh, hi, Demerius.
You're here early.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.723
Computer club.
I, um, did the report.

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:17.933
You said two pages?

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:20.610
So, is it okay that
I did it like that?

01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:23.522
- You drew this?
- Yeah, I finished the book.

01:18:24.325 --> 01:18:27.033
What they did to Piggy?
That was whack.

01:18:27.244 --> 01:18:29.361
Yeah, that was absolutely whack.

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.492
So, is it okay?

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:34.324
Yeah, it's okay.

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.500
Miss Jeffries, hold up a second!

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.879
- All right, I'll see you in class.
- See you in class.

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:41.547
Gosh, you look great.

01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:44.092
Will you stop it?
I'm not gonna quit my job.

01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:45.714
Who asked you to quit your job?

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:47.091
- You did.
- No, I didn't.

01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:48.513
- Yes, you did.
- No.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.090
I'll check my notes, but I'm...

01:18:50.309 --> 01:18:52.016
I'm pretty sure you
misunderstood me.

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:55.596
No, on the contrary,
I'm here to offer you...

01:18:55.814 --> 01:18:58.227
the assistant volleyball
coach position.

01:18:58.943 --> 01:19:01.560
Mrs. Garcia's out
on maternity leave.

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:03.069
Did you know she was pregnant?

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.397
- No.
- Neither did I.

01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:09.405
Uh, well, just think about it.
Get back to me, okay?

01:19:13.374 --> 01:19:15.787
- Principle Moss!
- I can't, I got a board...

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:18.163
No, no, come here,
I want you to see this.

01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:20.587
Demerius, that kid with
the comic, he did this.

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:22.915
This is amazing. Look at that.

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:26.752
You know what?
I was thinking about it over break...

01:19:26.971 --> 01:19:28.382
and I wanna shift the paradigm...

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.634
of the left-brained
didactic teaching structure...

01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:34.183
to a more right-brained,
outside-the-box learning style.

01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:35.636
Do you follow?

01:19:35.854 --> 01:19:36.970
- I...
- I'm so sorry.

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:39.681
It's such a bore when people
talk like assholes, isn't it?

01:19:40.234 --> 01:19:42.567
What I'm trying to say
is I want your support...

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:45.194
to do more stuff like this.
Oh, and you know what?

01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:47.898
I looked into cutting hair
and you are absolutely right.

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.776
Hairdressers make
a goddamn fortune.

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:53.203
It almost sounds like
you're threatening me.

01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:57.875
Stanley... Stan... relax.
We are on the same team, here.

01:19:58.085 --> 01:20:01.999
I am just trying to keep
your instructional scaffolding in place.

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:04.501
Especially right before testing.

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:07.796
Oh, and you know what?

01:20:08.012 --> 01:20:11.221
Yes to volleyball.
Sounds like an adventure.

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:13.426
Go Falcons!

01:20:16.562 --> 01:20:18.679
Edgeworth, he brought math
to economics.

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:21.230
He wrote the essay on
application of math...

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:23.650
to moral science, 1881.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:27.730
Leon Morris...
Theory of General Competitive-

01:20:27.948 --> 01:20:29.109
Hold on.

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:35.028
Hello? Yes. I know, I know.
I'll be there.

01:20:35.247 --> 01:20:37.239
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- Sorry, it was Kate.

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:40.371
<i>Well, you know, I gotta get to
bed anyway. I'll see you later?</i>

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:41.667
Sixteen days.

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.703
<i>Sixteen days.</i>

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:46.873
<i>Give me something
to dream about.</i>

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.250
Oh, you scamp.

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:50.551
<i>Come on.</i>

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:52.929
<i>Oh my goodness!</i>

01:20:53.557 --> 01:20:55.970
<i>Oh boy. You are the mo...</i>

01:21:17.456 --> 01:21:18.492
Hey.

01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:25.753
I'm here. Has it started?

01:21:26.673 --> 01:21:28.835
<i>I don't think that Kalynn's
going any farther.</i>

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:31.542
<i>She's cracking.</i>

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:36.423
<i>This is too hard.
I don't know if I can...</i>

01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:38.304
Who acts like that?

01:21:39.305 --> 01:21:45.825
