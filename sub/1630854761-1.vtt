WEBVTT

00:05.588 --> 00:07.757
(wind howling)

00:11.052 --> 00:13.430
(tense music)

00:15.807 --> 00:18.560
(indistinct shouting)

00:21.896 --> 00:24.315
- Stop her!

00:49.758 --> 00:52.135
(indistinct shouting)

01:09.652 --> 01:11.696
(indistinct chattering)

01:22.457 --> 01:24.209
(soft music)

01:24.250 --> 01:27.087
* Crazy, so crazy

01:27.128 --> 01:32.300
* I'm crazy for you

01:32.342 --> 01:34.511
* So

01:34.552 --> 01:37.722
* So crazy

01:37.764 --> 01:43.520
* So crazy for you *

01:43.561 --> 01:47.524
(applause)

01:50.527 --> 01:53.822
- Okay, next up we have
Alice Dhawan!

01:53.863 --> 01:58.493
(cheering, applause)

02:08.712 --> 02:10.171
(man coughing)

02:14.718 --> 02:17.262
(crowd murmuring)

02:17.303 --> 02:19.764
- I knew you were just
a one-hit-wonder.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.769
(fire alarm ringing)

02:27.230 --> 02:30.650
- I am so sorry. Just a clichÃ©
late parent here.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.485
What is happening?

02:32.527 --> 02:34.487
- So, no one's been able to
track Alice down.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.489
She bolted from
the scene of the crime.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.743
- Crime... Alice had stage
fright. How is that a crime?

02:39.784 --> 02:42.996
- Well, it isn't, but setting
off the fire alarm is

02:43.038 --> 02:45.248
and it comes with a hefty fine.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.834
- Okay, look, I, uh...
I will pay the fine

02:47.876 --> 02:51.212
and I am prepared to make
another generous donation

02:51.254 --> 02:53.256
to the school on behalf
of the Dhawan family.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.175
- Brady, seriously, just...
Just stop.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.510
- I agree with your wife.
(both): Ex-wife.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.847
- Sorry. She's been warned.
This is her last strike.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.932
- Ms. Mendoza, please.
Alice--

03:02.974 --> 03:06.353
- Alice is not welcome back
at this school.
She's out, I'm sorry.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.772
- Alice still isn't answering.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.816
- Yeah, and Charlotte just said
that she and Alice didn't speak
all summer.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.402
Apparently she's hanging with
a new crowd, so...

03:14.444 --> 03:16.321
- How could you not know that?

03:16.363 --> 03:19.157
- Uh, we both know
that getting anything

03:19.199 --> 03:22.077
out of Alice is challenging.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.079
- Why weren't you there today?

03:24.120 --> 03:27.957
- I was... getting fired.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.418
- You're their best reporter.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.797
- Yeah, but suddenly the paper
is downsizing and I am...

03:33.838 --> 03:36.549
Redundant. It's weird.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.843
- I'm sorry about that, Kat.

03:38.885 --> 03:42.222
But hey, it frees you up for
some homeschooling, right?

03:42.263 --> 03:47.352
- That job...
Was everything to me.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.605
And not all of us have family
money to fall back on.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.816
- Come on. I can help you out,
you just have to--

03:52.857 --> 03:56.069
- No, no, please. I... I can't
do that anymore.

03:56.111 --> 03:59.948
Just being in the house.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.866
- Kat, it's still your house.

04:01.908 --> 04:05.912
- No, it's not.

04:08.289 --> 04:11.501
So... Where was Rachel today?

04:11.543 --> 04:15.463
- Um, I told Rachel not to come

04:15.505 --> 04:17.424
because I have some news.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.509
Well, we have some news.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.428
Rachel moved in with me.

04:23.138 --> 04:26.141
- I... I didn't, um...

04:26.182 --> 04:29.561
I didn't realize that things
had progressed to that point.

04:31.479 --> 04:35.150
Uh... So, uh...
When are you gonna tell Alice?

04:35.191 --> 04:36.901
(sighing)

04:36.943 --> 04:39.112
(phone chiming)

04:39.154 --> 04:41.031
- It's Rachel. She knows where
Alice is.

04:41.072 --> 04:44.117
- What? Where?

04:44.159 --> 04:46.119
(indistinct chatter)

04:46.161 --> 04:47.871
(loud music playing)

04:47.912 --> 04:50.874
Okay, everybody out.

04:50.915 --> 04:54.377
- You heard her, party's over.
Get out of our house!

04:54.419 --> 04:56.129
- Are you serious right now?

04:56.171 --> 04:59.966
- Are you? And... Really?
This guy?

05:05.722 --> 05:08.600
- How could you do that to my
friends?!

05:08.641 --> 05:11.227
- Alice. Those kids
are not your friends.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.897
- They listen to me.
When was the last time that
either of you did that?

05:13.938 --> 05:16.941
- Well, listening
would require talking.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.487
Sit.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.408
- Hey, Kat. I gotta go.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.827
- Wait, what?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
What are you doing?

05:27.869 --> 05:29.996
- Well, I can't stay. I'm doing
court early tomorrow morning

05:30.038 --> 05:31.998
and I should've been
back at the office hours ago.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.709
- But...

05:37.587 --> 05:40.507
Oh, no, no, no. We are not done.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.343
- Dad's done. Besides,
I'm expelled, aren't I?

05:43.385 --> 05:45.345
What else is there
to talk about?

05:45.387 --> 05:47.347
- What is going on with you?

05:47.389 --> 05:50.642
I mean, you owned
that showcase last year.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.019
If this is about
your dad and I--

05:53.061 --> 05:56.064
- Don't flatter yourself.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.149
- Ali, you are so talented.

05:58.191 --> 06:02.946
You have such a gift.
Why are you throwing it away?

06:02.987 --> 06:05.198
- Why do you care?
You didn't even show up!

06:05.240 --> 06:08.702
- Okay, wait, wait, just...

06:08.743 --> 06:10.704
I deserved that.

06:10.745 --> 06:15.542
But not being there does
not mean that I don't care.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.753
I am constantly
worried about you

06:18.795 --> 06:21.047
and looking out
for you, and I...

06:21.089 --> 06:23.675
I will be damned if I let you
make the same mistakes

06:23.717 --> 06:25.719
that I did when I was your age.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.930
- So now I'm a mistake.
- No, that's not what I meant.

06:28.972 --> 06:32.767
- Fine. Maybe I am. Clearly,
this family is a big mistake.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.686
- Alice.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.441
(sighing)

06:41.276 --> 06:44.446
(soft music)

07:44.005 --> 07:46.299
(exhales)

07:46.925 --> 07:52.222
- Hello.
- Hey, Mom, it's um... It's me.

07:55.016 --> 07:59.396
(soft guitar music)

07:59.437 --> 08:03.900
* Where will you go
my darling daughter *

08:03.942 --> 08:07.821
* I'm gonna live
down by the water *

08:07.862 --> 08:11.157
* If I ever could
find the time *

08:11.199 --> 08:13.868
* Never no reason or rhyme

08:13.910 --> 08:17.205
* I'm gonna live down
by the water *

08:17.247 --> 08:18.998
Isn't it so beautiful here?

08:19.040 --> 08:24.421
Moving back is just gonna be so
good for you. For us.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.214
- It's not a move.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.466
Dad will want me back with him
when work gets less crazy.

08:28.508 --> 08:34.848
- Um... Well, I-I think right
now, this is the better option.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.809
- And I think that it sucks that
you lost your job,

08:37.851 --> 08:39.853
but it shouldn't mean that I
have to move to

08:39.894 --> 08:41.980
middle of nowhere Canada
and live with a grandmother

08:42.022 --> 08:43.356
I don't know.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.817
* And I'll wash my tears away

08:45.859 --> 08:48.653
* When I'm down
in the river today *

08:49.612 --> 08:51.990
How are you even cool
with being back here?

08:52.032 --> 08:55.368
I mean, with what you have told
me about what happened.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.580
I don't know what I'd do
if I lost my little
brother that young.

08:59.664 --> 09:03.376
- I'm here because
in spite of all that,

09:03.418 --> 09:06.379
this really is
a special place.

09:06.421 --> 09:10.258
- If it's so special, how come
you stayed away for the last
20 years?

09:10.300 --> 09:14.596
* Sing a little song, darling

09:14.637 --> 09:18.266
* Sing it like
a little blue starling *

09:18.308 --> 09:21.603
* In the country or the town

09:21.644 --> 09:24.939
* And for miles all around

09:24.981 --> 09:29.361
* Sing a little song, darling

09:37.285 --> 09:38.995
(sighing)

09:50.298 --> 09:53.426
Mom. Hi.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.762
- Katherine.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.848
- Uh... I first just wanted to
say thank you for--

09:58.890 --> 10:01.309
- Alice.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.353
Look at you!

10:03.395 --> 10:07.315
You have grown into such a
beautiful young woman. Aw...

10:07.357 --> 10:09.567
Welcome to Landry Farm.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.319
How about a tour?

10:11.361 --> 10:14.614
- Oh, I was just about to start
unpacking the car, so...

10:14.656 --> 10:16.991
- That's okay, you're not
invited.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.327
Don't worry about your mom.
She knows the lay of the land.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.788
Not much has changed
in 20 years.

10:39.347 --> 10:43.810
(soft music)

10:43.852 --> 10:46.938
(children laughing)

11:12.380 --> 11:16.051
* Be mine

11:16.968 --> 11:21.723
* For the best part of my life

11:37.864 --> 11:41.201
- My family hails from the
Carolinas, but the farm

11:41.242 --> 11:44.579
has been in the Landry
family for generations.

11:44.621 --> 11:48.041
It was last handed down
to my husband, Colton.

11:48.083 --> 11:53.963
And someday, who knows,
if you play your cards right...

11:54.005 --> 11:57.258
- Sorry, I'm not a farmer.
- Right.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.054
You're a singer, yeah?

12:01.096 --> 12:03.556
- Well, I was, but not anymore.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.892
- Once a singer, always a
singer.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.769
You get that from Cole's
side of the family.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.271
You couldn't stop
those people from singing.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.440
(dog barking)

12:12.482 --> 12:15.026
Ah, Fynn!
No, you crazy dog.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.988
You're not going back
in the house like that. Ugh!

12:19.030 --> 12:22.784
There's a pond in those woods
and he can't stay away from it.

12:22.826 --> 12:25.578
It's really more
like a sinkhole.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.914
- Sounds charming.

12:31.376 --> 12:34.421
- Dinner was great, Mom.
I really missed
your roast chicken.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.798
- Oh, my pleasure.

12:38.133 --> 12:41.594
So, what do you two have planned
while you're here?

12:41.636 --> 12:43.763
You need a plan.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.599
Landry women have got
to keep busy.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.269
- Um... I-I...

12:49.310 --> 12:52.605
Actually, I was thinking that
I was going to write a book.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.400
You know, there's a few editors
that have expressed interest

12:55.442 --> 12:58.903
over the years, and I've got
some really great ideas, so...

12:58.945 --> 13:01.072
- Is that a practical solution?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.700
Don't worry, there are still
jobs in town.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.911
I hear they're hiring
at The Point.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.955
- Better dust off
that resume, Mom.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.957
- And Alice, you
start school tomorrow.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.585
- Um, actually, I'm just gonna
do the rest of the year online.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.504
- That's a terrible idea.
Go to school and meet
some kids your age.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.465
- Honestly, I think I'm fine.

13:18.506 --> 13:23.053
- Suit yourself, but the
internet out here is spotty
at best.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.388
You'll have to trek
to the library.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.432
On the bright side,

13:27.474 --> 13:30.185
I hear they just got a set
of those Twilight books.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.066
- Fine. I'll go to school.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.526
- Good. Because I already
registered you.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.653
You start tomorrow.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.405
(clears throat)
- Which room is mine?

13:42.447 --> 13:44.282
- Upstairs, end of the hall.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.493
- Oh no, actually, I set her up
in my room, there's more space.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.286
So, I'm in Jacob's.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.873
(soft music)

13:56.795 --> 13:59.130
- What the hell
am I even doing here?

14:23.321 --> 14:25.990
- So, how are
things with Braden?

14:26.032 --> 14:29.077
- The separation is
no longer temporary.

14:29.119 --> 14:31.037
We are filing for divorce.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.581
We just couldn't make it work.

14:33.623 --> 14:39.379
- Well, you met at camp, what,
when you were 15? People change.

14:39.421 --> 14:42.048
- Yeah, but you and Dad were
teenagers and you made it work.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.386
- Well, that's the thing
about young love.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.513
You either grow together
or you grow apart.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.015
(chuckles)

14:51.516 --> 14:55.186
- You know, I... I have to say
it really meant a lot

14:55.228 --> 14:57.522
that you took the first
step to mend fences.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.983
Your letter was so touching--

15:00.025 --> 15:02.777
- Letter?
What are you talking about?

15:02.819 --> 15:05.280
You took the first step
by calling me after
all these years.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.907
- I called because
of the letter.

15:07.949 --> 15:10.660
Are you really denying
sending it?

15:10.702 --> 15:12.203
- Yes, 'cause I didn't.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.458
- Mom, it was in your
handwriting.

15:24.716 --> 15:28.303
- Please, Dad.
I want to come home.

15:28.345 --> 15:31.222
I know you're busy, but I'm 15.
I don't need a babysitter.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.433
Please.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.101
Yeah, forget it.

15:36.144 --> 15:42.275
You're cutting out, Dad.
Dad? Hello?

15:42.317 --> 15:44.986
(sighing)

16:11.721 --> 16:15.350
- I can't reach.
- Let me help you.

16:15.392 --> 16:20.939
- Stay still.
- You're so heavy!

16:20.980 --> 16:26.111
(laughing)

16:26.152 --> 16:29.698
- Did you know explorers used
the star to lead them home

16:29.739 --> 16:32.242
when they got lost?

16:49.551 --> 16:51.219
- Morning.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.639
Don't you want to get dressed?
You don't want to be late.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.641
- Caffeine first.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.978
- Get some breakfast too.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.772
- Sorry, I don't do breakfast.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.108
- I see.

17:05.150 --> 17:08.236
Do you mind letting Fynn
out please?

17:10.488 --> 17:12.782
- 'Kay. Fynn!

17:22.917 --> 17:25.795
- You must be the American
granddaughter. Alice, right?

17:31.760 --> 17:34.471
- That'll teach you to get
dressed before breakfast.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.931
- You did that on purpose?
(laughing)

17:36.973 --> 17:40.060
- Who are those people?!
- What people?

17:40.101 --> 17:42.187
- Ah, they're just kids
from the high school.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.314
They get community service hours
for working on the farm.

17:44.356 --> 17:46.149
I can introduce you if you like.

17:46.191 --> 17:49.235
- Wow. That was kind of evil,
but I really loved it.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.700
- Hey, kids!
The garden looks great!

17:55.742 --> 17:58.244
(clears throat)

17:59.954 --> 18:03.083
- Jack, hi, hi!
This is Kat Landry.

18:03.124 --> 18:06.127
We met a couple years
ago at Harry's party.

18:06.169 --> 18:10.423
Right. Dhawan. Kat, Kat Dhawan.

18:10.465 --> 18:14.010
Um, well, I don't know if you
remember but um, you did mention

18:14.052 --> 18:16.179
at the party that if I ever got
serious about writing a book

18:16.221 --> 18:20.350
I should call
and... I am serious!

18:22.394 --> 18:27.482
Right. Right. Um... Well, keep
in touch, I...

18:27.524 --> 18:29.734
Thanks.

18:32.821 --> 18:35.615
- You may have thought you were
helping but it was presumptuous

18:35.657 --> 18:38.451
to mail that letter.
Where did you find it?

18:38.493 --> 18:40.912
- Del, what are you
even talking about?

18:40.954 --> 18:44.582
(indistinct chatter)

18:44.624 --> 18:46.626
- You know what
I'm talking about.

18:51.256 --> 18:55.802
- Well, Kat Landry.
Welcome home.

18:55.844 --> 19:02.225
- Elliot Augustine. Oh my God!
Hi! Oh, wow! El!

19:02.267 --> 19:04.102
I mean, look at... Look at you.

19:04.144 --> 19:07.647
Wow, because it's been a while.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.232
(stammering)
What are you doing here?

19:09.274 --> 19:11.067
- I moved home a few years ago.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.986
I teach science at
the high school.

19:13.028 --> 19:15.822
- That is not at all surprising.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.450
- Well, you two have a lot to
get caught up on.

19:18.491 --> 19:23.079
You have a lot in common.
Both your divorces and all.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.873
(chuckling)

19:24.914 --> 19:27.625
- Subtle, still.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.503
- So, you and Brady?
- Yeah.

19:30.545 --> 19:34.507
- Sorry to hear.
- Well, you too.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.760
I mean, God, I didn't even
know you were married.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.553
- Surprise.
- Yeah.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.972
- Mom!

19:41.014 --> 19:43.558
It's one thing to be new, and
it's another thing to be late,

19:43.600 --> 19:45.435
and it's not happening, okay?
We have to go!

19:46.186 --> 19:49.606
- Um... That's my daughter.

19:49.647 --> 19:53.651
Um, duty calls, so...
Yeah, we need to catch up.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.904
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:55.945 --> 19:58.615
(Alice): I didn't even know
what to wear! I literally
hate everything I own!

19:58.656 --> 20:02.160
- Hmm... Okay!

20:02.202 --> 20:03.828
(school bell ringing)

20:03.870 --> 20:06.414
(indistinct chatter)

20:12.837 --> 20:15.131
- Hey, it's you.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.509
I could barely recognize you
without your bunny slippers.
Alice, right?

20:17.550 --> 20:20.345
Spencer and my girlfriend, Zoey.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.306
- Alright, well,
nice to meet you both.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.141
- Don't worry. We'll shield
you from the throngs.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.810
And the rumors.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.813
- Rumors?
- Typically small town,
broken telephone.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.524
Like you set your old school
on fire. Dumb things like that.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.067
(school bell ringing)

20:34.109 --> 20:36.861
- Find us at lunch, okay?

20:36.903 --> 20:39.280
(phone ringing)

20:39.322 --> 20:43.118
- Hey. Gotta make it quick.
Who knows how long these bars
will last out here.

20:43.159 --> 20:46.329
- Okay, uh, I was just calling
to see how you guys were doing.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.957
- Oh, sure. Sure, yeah.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.710
Well, let's talk about
your phone call
with Alice last night.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.045
I mean, turning her
down like that

20:54.087 --> 20:56.047
and using work as an excuse?

20:56.089 --> 20:59.384
And I cannot believe that you
haven't told her about Rachel.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.053
- I didn't turn Alice
down because of Rachel,

21:02.095 --> 21:03.805
I did it in
solidarity with you.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.851
Look, I know how important
it is to have Alice
out there with you.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.644
And I know that...

21:10.562 --> 21:12.439
Alice isn't the only one
feeling vulnerable.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.983
Being back there can't be easy.

21:15.025 --> 21:19.779
- Mom's pretty much erased all
traces of Jacob and Dad, and...

21:19.821 --> 21:25.785
This house used to be filled
with so much music and laughter.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.871
- I remember.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.250
Look, just, uh...

21:32.292 --> 21:34.127
Just keep your head up.
You got this, okay?

21:34.169 --> 21:37.464
(scoffs)
- Right. Thanks.

21:37.505 --> 21:40.050
- And tell Alice I love her.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.760
- And me?

21:41.801 --> 21:45.555
- Yeah, of course you.
Okay, bye.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.526
- So you're keeping bees now?

21:58.568 --> 22:01.446
- Yeah. Got 'em off
of Craigslist.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.656
They're endangered.

22:03.698 --> 22:05.533
Thought I'd do my
part, you know?

22:05.575 --> 22:07.452
- Yeah, sounds about right.

22:07.494 --> 22:11.915
I, um... I wanted to commend you
on your redecorating.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.292
It's very Airbnb.

22:14.334 --> 22:17.003
When did you decide to do that?

22:17.045 --> 22:20.590
- I don't know. Just happened
over the years.

22:20.632 --> 22:26.429
- Oh. And all the photos of us?
Of Jacob and Dad?

22:26.471 --> 22:29.265
They just, what,
disappeared over the years too?

22:29.307 --> 22:31.976
Mom, it's like
they never existed.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.104
- Look, Kat.

22:34.145 --> 22:36.523
Just because you came home,
doesn't mean we pick up

22:36.564 --> 22:38.191
right where we left off.

22:38.233 --> 22:40.777
I've moved on. You should too.

22:40.819 --> 22:43.780
- Start your life over. You're
floundering, I can see it.

22:43.822 --> 22:47.992
- I'm floundering because I have
nothing left to cling to.

22:49.369 --> 22:52.497
You erased all of it.

23:01.006 --> 23:03.842
- The limits of human
perception are fascinating.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.761
Take optical illusions,
for example.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.847
They trick the brain,

23:08.888 --> 23:11.391
but it really just has to do
with light and how it travels.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.435
(school bell ringing)

23:13.476 --> 23:16.563
Okay, guys.
The bell tolls for thee.

23:16.604 --> 23:19.107
(chuckles)
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:19.149 --> 23:21.901
Uh, sorry, Alice?

23:21.943 --> 23:24.696
Figured I should officially
introduce myself.

23:24.738 --> 23:26.489
Didn't really get
a chance earlier.

23:26.531 --> 23:29.159
I'm not sure if your mom
mentioned it.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.954
But anyway, I'm an old friend.
I grew up next door to the farm.

23:32.996 --> 23:35.040
- Oh. Great.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.958
- I'd do anything
for the Landry's.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.085
They've always been
like a second family to me.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.962
It's nice to meet
the next generation.

23:41.004 --> 23:44.758
- Well, technically I'm a
Dhawan, so...

23:44.799 --> 23:47.177
- Sure. But if you ever
need to talk, I'm here.

23:47.218 --> 23:50.138
Any place,
any time, okay?

23:50.180 --> 23:53.933
- Okay, thanks. I should get to
my next class.

23:53.975 --> 23:55.977
- Yeah.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.604
- Quick, don't let her touch it.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.356
- Whew, is it getting hot in
here?

24:01.149 --> 24:05.028
(tense music)

24:23.296 --> 24:26.383
- Look at all the wheels.
Everything's connected,
isn't it?

24:26.424 --> 24:28.635
- Yeah.

24:28.677 --> 24:30.303
- Alright, now let's
see the cover.

24:30.345 --> 24:33.056
- The cover goes in here.
- I think you're right.

24:33.098 --> 24:37.060
Hey, have you done this before?
- Maybe.

24:37.102 --> 24:42.273
(soft music)

25:00.208 --> 25:02.043
(sighs)

25:17.017 --> 25:19.853
- I'm gonna fill it with
treasure and bury it.

25:22.939 --> 25:27.694
- There you are.
Alice is skipping school.

25:27.736 --> 25:30.405
- What? How do you know that.

25:30.447 --> 25:34.367
- Clearly you have forgotten
how fast news travels here.

25:41.249 --> 25:47.881
- Hey. Present time.
Happy 13th birthday, kiddo.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.886
- Oh, look at that.

25:52.927 --> 25:55.055
- Seriously? But this is
yours, Mom. Dad gave it to you.

25:55.096 --> 25:57.807
- Well, it's meant
for a teenager,

25:57.849 --> 25:59.976
and you always loved it.

26:00.018 --> 26:01.978
- What do you think, Dad?

26:02.020 --> 26:04.898
- Uh, yeah.
Looks great on you, Al.

26:13.323 --> 26:15.867
- Car. Now.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.871
Hey. Hey! Where do you think
you're going?

26:19.913 --> 26:21.915
- Away from you.

26:21.956 --> 26:24.084
- How could you not give it one
measly day?

26:24.125 --> 26:26.670
I mean, I can't believe
that you won't even try

26:26.711 --> 26:28.755
to make something of
our new start here.

26:28.797 --> 26:31.925
- I never asked for a new start!
- Well, too bad, 'cause you're
stuck with me.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.927
- No I'm not,
I'll go live with Dad.

26:33.968 --> 26:35.595
- Oh, right. Okay, well, good
luck with that.

26:36.054 --> 26:38.264
- Did you tell him
to say no to me?

26:38.306 --> 26:40.600
Did you tell him not to
let me live with him?
Is that why he said no?!

26:40.642 --> 26:43.603
- No, I would never do that!

26:43.645 --> 26:46.898
- Okay, so he just doesn't want
me then. Is that what you mean?
- No. Your dad has his reasons.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.233
- Yeah, he's busy with work,
that's all.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.902
- That's not all, okay?
Rachel moved in with him.

26:57.659 --> 27:02.122
- So that's it then?
It's over?

27:02.163 --> 27:07.377
- Oh, Ali, honey. It's...
It's been over for so long.

27:07.419 --> 27:11.631
I am so sorry,
but you had to know that.

27:11.673 --> 27:16.428
Alice. Alice, please, stop!
Just...

27:16.469 --> 27:18.888
Come back!

27:45.498 --> 27:51.463
(eerie music)

28:05.602 --> 28:10.607
(suspenseful music)

28:56.528 --> 29:02.075
(indistinct chatter)

29:06.496 --> 29:10.625
(laughter)

29:21.928 --> 29:23.930
(coughing)

29:23.972 --> 29:26.933
- Hold on, I got you.

29:26.975 --> 29:28.768
Just keep taking
deep breaths, okay?

29:28.810 --> 29:32.313
(coughing)

29:32.355 --> 29:35.358
What were you thinking
swimming in there?

29:35.400 --> 29:37.819
It's full of leeches
and who knows what else?

29:37.861 --> 29:41.114
Plus you're on my family's land,

29:41.156 --> 29:42.907
which is fine,
but if you drowned,

29:42.949 --> 29:45.118
we could get in serious
trouble.

29:45.160 --> 29:49.122
- Wait, this is
your family's land?

29:49.164 --> 29:53.126
- Yeah. I'm Katherine Landry.
But everyone just calls me Kat.

29:54.210 --> 29:57.213
- You're Kat Landry?

30:04.512 --> 30:07.474
- Alice skipped school
and has totally bolted.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.434
Apparently,
that's her thing now.

30:09.476 --> 30:13.271
- Bolted, huh?
- I think I messed this up.

30:13.313 --> 30:18.777
Well, I mean, moving back.
Alice was struggling.

30:18.818 --> 30:22.822
You know, she was such a good
kid and a great student,

30:22.864 --> 30:25.241
and I guess
I thought moving here

30:25.283 --> 30:28.661
would bring
the old Alice back.

30:28.703 --> 30:31.623
- I'm sure it will.

30:31.664 --> 30:35.335
- I don't know. I'm starting to
think that it was a selfish
decision to come here.

30:35.377 --> 30:39.214
That it wasn't Alice who needed
to be here, it was... me.

30:39.255 --> 30:41.966
- The older you get,

30:42.008 --> 30:44.803
the more you need the people you
knew when you were young.

30:44.844 --> 30:47.764
(laughing)
- No, God.

30:47.806 --> 30:50.892
Do you remember how obsessed we
were when that song came out?

30:50.934 --> 30:54.729
- Yes, obviously!
Everybody's Free was the
spoken-word hit of the late 90s.

30:54.771 --> 30:58.525
- We'd just listen to it over
and over again trying to
memorize all the lyrics.

30:58.566 --> 31:01.861
- I broke the Repeat One button
on my cheap CD player,
if I recall.

31:01.903 --> 31:04.155
- Cheap, yes.
(chuckling)

31:04.823 --> 31:06.616
I'm sorry we lost touch.

31:09.994 --> 31:13.081
- Me too. Life.

31:13.123 --> 31:16.793
- Life.

31:16.835 --> 31:19.546
(chuckling)

31:19.587 --> 31:21.798
- I should... get going.
(clears throat)

31:21.840 --> 31:24.676
- Later, Kat.
- Later.

31:24.718 --> 31:27.303
(sighing)

31:27.345 --> 31:29.806
- So who are you anyway?

31:29.848 --> 31:32.600
I just haven't seen you around.
What's your name?

31:32.642 --> 31:37.731
- Uh, Alice. I just moved here.
Not here, here, but--

31:37.772 --> 31:40.108
- Hey, wait up. There's a pink
moon tonight, Kat.

31:40.150 --> 31:42.777
- Not really my thing, Elliot.

31:42.819 --> 31:44.946
- Elliot?

31:44.988 --> 31:48.033
- El, meet the new girl in town.
Alice.

31:48.074 --> 31:51.536
Alice, that's my
best friend, Elliot.

31:51.578 --> 31:55.290
- Hi. Seriously, Kat, you're
gonna want to check this out.

31:55.331 --> 31:57.792
This moon's gonna be epic.
I'm setting up the telescope.

31:57.834 --> 32:00.337
- Sorry. My dad needs me for
dinner tonight.

32:00.378 --> 32:03.965
- Now don't go using your old
man as an excuse.

32:06.051 --> 32:09.012
- Is... Is that...
Is he...

32:09.054 --> 32:11.806
- Yeah. My dad.

32:11.848 --> 32:15.268
- But we actually do have
something to celebrate tonight,
don't we?

32:15.310 --> 32:18.605
- Yeah, hey, congrats on getting
your article published
in The Herald.

32:18.646 --> 32:21.066
- My daughter
the intrepid reporter.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.568
Who we got here?

32:23.985 --> 32:26.571
- Alice.
It's so nice to meet you.

32:26.613 --> 32:30.492
- It's nice to meet you too,
Alice. What happened to you?

32:30.533 --> 32:35.830
- Um... I found her in the pond.
Swimming, actually.

32:35.872 --> 32:38.958
Yeah, she's new in town.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.585
I'll tell you about
it at dinner.

32:40.627 --> 32:42.337
Come on.

32:49.427 --> 32:52.013
Alright, let's get
you some clothes.

32:55.767 --> 33:01.773
(soft music)

33:06.069 --> 33:10.073
Ugh! I literally
hate everything I own.

33:10.115 --> 33:11.950
My clothes are
the worst, sorry.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.411
- I hear you. It'll be fine.

33:14.452 --> 33:15.912
The 90s are totally
back in style anyway.

33:15.954 --> 33:18.248
- What?

33:18.289 --> 33:20.959
- Nothing. Uh...
Show me what you got!

33:21.001 --> 33:24.671
- Your photos are terrific.

33:24.713 --> 33:26.965
You have such a
beautiful eye, Jacob.

33:27.007 --> 33:29.009
- Silly, I have two.

33:29.050 --> 33:33.304
(Del laughing)

33:40.478 --> 33:42.856
I hear the sink hole
almost got you.

33:42.897 --> 33:47.318
- Almost. But uh, I made
it out thanks to Kat.

33:47.360 --> 33:51.948
- We're so happy to have you.
Welcome, Alice.

33:51.990 --> 33:54.993
- Pass me some of that roasted
chicken, my love.

33:55.035 --> 33:57.120
- Of course, honey.

33:57.162 --> 33:59.581
- I promise I didn't just marry
this woman for her cooking.
No lie.

33:59.622 --> 34:01.750
- Ah. I thought you married me
for my money.

34:01.791 --> 34:03.626
- Now that's a lie.

34:03.668 --> 34:07.630
Actually, I married you
because you're smart and funny,

34:07.672 --> 34:10.967
and you happen to have the best
legs in the entire province.

34:11.009 --> 34:13.470
- Ew, Dad!
- What? It's true!
She still does.

34:13.511 --> 34:15.472
- Well, I'm glad you think so,
sweetheart.

34:15.513 --> 34:19.017
But you are embarrassing
the children.

34:19.059 --> 34:21.227
- Oh, well, I apologize.

34:21.269 --> 34:22.312
- You have to have
your green beans.

34:22.354 --> 34:23.646
- So, Alice, where
do you hail from?

34:23.688 --> 34:26.816
- Uh... I'm from the states,
actually.

34:26.858 --> 34:28.360
- Which state?

34:29.819 --> 34:31.946
- Well, we moved a lot,
so I'm from all over, really.

34:31.988 --> 34:35.033
- What brings you and your
family to Port Haven, then?

34:35.075 --> 34:37.243
- Well, it's just me and my mom,

34:37.285 --> 34:39.621
and my parents
separated recently.

34:39.662 --> 34:43.458
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
That must be so hard.

34:43.500 --> 34:47.796
- Yeah, Kat.
Yeah, it's really hard.

34:47.837 --> 34:50.090
- Do we get Kat's room
when she's gone?

34:50.131 --> 34:52.842
- Not right now, Jacob.
- Gone? Where are you going?

34:52.884 --> 34:55.595
- I got a camp counselor job
across the border.

34:55.637 --> 34:58.014
- Would that be at
Camp Tanamakoon?

34:59.516 --> 35:02.435
- Yeah. How'd you know that?

35:02.477 --> 35:04.979
- Uh, I... I've just,
I've heard of it.

35:05.021 --> 35:07.691
- Really? Weird.

35:07.732 --> 35:10.819
And no, you can't have my room.
(laughing)

35:10.860 --> 35:13.947
Honestly, I don't even know
if I want to go.

35:13.988 --> 35:17.117
I'm just so totally nervous.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.868
- Oh, but you definitely
have to go.

35:18.910 --> 35:20.870
- Why?

35:20.912 --> 35:23.123
- Well, you never know
who you might meet, right?

35:23.164 --> 35:26.001
- Alice is right.
It'll be an amazing experience.

35:26.042 --> 35:28.753
- Getting out of your comfort
zone and going someplace new

35:28.795 --> 35:31.214
can be scary, but it's how we
learn about ourselves.

35:31.256 --> 35:34.843
Rule number one:
don't fear change.

35:34.884 --> 35:37.012
I'm sure Alice knows what
I'm talking about,
having just moved here.

35:37.053 --> 35:40.098
You gotta jump in feet first.
Isn't that right, Alice?

35:40.140 --> 35:42.934
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

35:48.982 --> 35:52.068
- How can you be so calm?

35:52.110 --> 35:55.822
I mean, I'm... I'm over here
just starting to lose my mind.

35:55.864 --> 35:59.242
I mean, yes, Alice does this
and the best thing to do

35:59.284 --> 36:03.121
is just give her space, but
she does not know this town.

36:03.163 --> 36:05.165
She could be anywhere.

36:05.206 --> 36:07.625
- Alice will be fine.

36:07.667 --> 36:09.544
- Well, Jacob wasn't.

36:11.463 --> 36:13.715
How could I have
thought that coming home

36:13.757 --> 36:16.092
would bring this
family closer?

36:16.134 --> 36:19.054
And you...

36:19.095 --> 36:24.601
You know, I-I see Jake
and Dad everywhere.

36:25.977 --> 36:29.147
You can cover them up, Mom.
They're still here.

36:34.819 --> 36:36.738
(sighs)

36:42.994 --> 36:45.955
* Somewhere deep inside

36:45.997 --> 36:49.793
* Something's got
a hold on you *

36:52.587 --> 36:56.800
* And it's pushing me aside

36:56.841 --> 36:59.719
* See it stretch on forever

37:01.638 --> 37:07.060
* And I know I'm right

37:07.102 --> 37:11.815
* For the first time
in my life *

37:11.856 --> 37:16.820
* That's why I tell you

37:16.861 --> 37:21.199
* You better be home soon *

37:23.326 --> 37:25.453
- Sorry, I...

37:25.495 --> 37:27.038
- No, never apologize
for talent.

37:27.080 --> 37:30.667
- It's just, my mom
gave me a guitar

37:30.709 --> 37:32.669
that looks just like that

37:32.711 --> 37:34.838
and it's one of my
favourite possessions.

37:34.879 --> 37:36.756
- Huh. So you sing and play too?

37:36.798 --> 37:40.093
- Uh, yeah. I do.

37:40.135 --> 37:42.429
- It's getting dark. I don't
want you walking home alone.

37:42.470 --> 37:45.056
Colton and Kat
can walk you.

37:45.098 --> 37:47.934
- No, it's fine. I'm fine.
I'll just grab my clothes.

37:47.976 --> 37:52.272
- I'll see you around, right?
- Uh, yeah. I'll try.

37:52.313 --> 37:55.233
- Hey, Alice!

37:55.275 --> 37:57.736
Later, gator.

37:58.570 --> 38:01.573
- You take care
of yourself, okay?

38:01.614 --> 38:04.075
- Sure, you too. But you better
watch out for the white witch
on your walk home.

38:04.117 --> 38:06.786
She haunts the forest and takes
little kids and--

38:06.828 --> 38:08.872
- Oh, shush, Jacob!

38:08.913 --> 38:12.208
Alice has plenty of time
to learn the local lore.

38:12.250 --> 38:16.796
- Well, I just want to say
you are an amazing family.

38:16.838 --> 38:20.800
It's so nice to see
and I'm just so glad I met you.

38:21.676 --> 38:24.971
- Say cheese!

38:25.013 --> 38:27.724
- Jake! If I look ugly in that,
I'm gonna burn it!

38:27.766 --> 38:31.186
- Run, buddy. Run. Run!
- Give it to me!

38:31.227 --> 38:34.814
(laughing)

38:34.856 --> 38:37.067
Jake, no, I'm serious!
Give me the picture!

39:11.101 --> 39:13.895
- Hey, you've reached Alice.
Leave a message.

39:13.937 --> 39:15.689
Or don't. Whatever.

39:15.730 --> 39:17.857
(phone beeps)

39:17.899 --> 39:22.570
- Ali, it's me.
Um, please just...

39:22.612 --> 39:25.907
Just come home, baby. I...

39:25.949 --> 39:27.992
You were right, okay?

39:28.034 --> 39:31.788
It was a mistake to
come here, but we can...

39:31.830 --> 39:34.332
We'll figure this
out together, okay?

39:34.374 --> 39:37.293
I love you.
You are my everything, kiddo.

39:37.335 --> 39:40.380
You know that?

39:40.422 --> 39:44.718
Okay, um... Call me.

39:44.759 --> 39:49.431
Okay, please, just... Bye.
I-I love you.

40:00.734 --> 40:03.820
(sighs)

40:13.788 --> 40:19.002
(ominous music)

40:22.130 --> 40:26.676
(phone buzzing)

40:26.718 --> 40:30.805
Yeah. Thanks, Elliot.
That's super helpful.

40:39.147 --> 40:40.940
- Kat?

40:40.982 --> 40:44.778
- It's me, it's just Alice.
I saw the light on.

40:44.819 --> 40:46.988
- Oh. What are you
doing up here?

40:47.030 --> 40:49.324
- You once told me that you
would help me.

40:49.366 --> 40:52.202
Any place, any time.

40:52.243 --> 40:55.955
- I-I... I did not.
We literally just met.

40:55.997 --> 40:58.375
- No, trust me, you did,
and I need your help.

40:58.416 --> 41:01.086
Right here, right now.

41:03.380 --> 41:06.216
(phone buzzing)

41:13.598 --> 41:16.851
(phone rings)

41:16.893 --> 41:20.271
- Kat?
- Don't worry? Seriously?

41:20.313 --> 41:24.609
How do you know Alice will come
home, El? How?

41:24.651 --> 41:28.988
(sighs)
- I just... do.

41:30.198 --> 41:32.534
(soft music)

41:32.575 --> 41:35.995
* Down by the water

41:37.580 --> 41:41.251
* Sing a little song, darling

41:42.794 --> 41:45.630
* Sing it like
a little blue starling *

41:47.090 --> 41:51.594
* In the country or the town
and for miles all around *

41:52.637 --> 41:55.974
* Sing a little song, darling
