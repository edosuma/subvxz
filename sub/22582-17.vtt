00:09.527 --> 00:11.358
Enterprise to Shuttlepod One.

00:18.247 --> 00:20.078
Captain Archer, please respond.

00:21.687 --> 00:23.598
Enterprise to Shuttlepod One.

00:24.647 --> 00:26.478
Captain Archer, please respond.

00:29.447 --> 00:32.119
- Lieutenant?
- They took some weapons fire.

00:33.127 --> 00:34.719
Main power's off-line...

00:35.327 --> 00:37.682
gravity plating, life support.

00:38.287 --> 00:40.926
- Bio-signs?
- None.

00:45.767 --> 00:48.520
It's been a long road

00:49.847 --> 00:51.803
Gettin' from there to here

00:53.167 --> 00:55.840
It's been a long time

00:56.687 --> 01:00.157
But my time is finally near

01:00.567 --> 01:04.116
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:04.887 --> 01:07.720
I will touch the sky

01:08.167 --> 01:11.716
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:11.927 --> 01:14.805
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:14.927 --> 01:19.159
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:19.567 --> 01:22.525
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:22.647 --> 01:26.845
I've got faith to believe

01:26.967 --> 01:29.765
I can do anything

01:29.887 --> 01:33.675
I've got strength of the soul

01:34.447 --> 01:37.280
And no one's gonna bend or break me

01:37.407 --> 01:41.116
I can reach any star

01:42.807 --> 01:44.843
I've got faith

01:46.687 --> 01:49.804
I've got faith

01:50.407 --> 01:53.638
Faith of the heart

02:13.207 --> 02:15.562
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

02:15.687 --> 02:17.200
Trip and I have left Keto-Enol...

02:17.327 --> 02:20.558
where we had a successful
first contact with the Enolians.

02:20.687 --> 02:23.440
We also found time
to squeeze in a little R and R.

02:24.847 --> 02:26.963
There's only one more log entry
after that.

02:27.087 --> 02:30.079
- Something about a pan zan match.
- Pan zan?

02:30.447 --> 02:31.926
It's a sporting event.

02:32.047 --> 02:34.686
The Captain said it was the closest
thing to water polo he'd seen...

02:34.807 --> 02:36.240
since we left Earth.

02:37.167 --> 02:40.443
- Sensor logs?
- Too badly damaged to be much help.

02:40.567 --> 02:43.798
If I may,
I've been running a forensic analysis.

02:44.687 --> 02:47.679
There are traces of human blood
on the deck and bulkheads...

02:47.807 --> 02:50.002
both the Captain's and
Commander Tucker's.

02:50.967 --> 02:53.083
Lieutenant Reed believes
they were abducted.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.401
If they were...

02:54.927 --> 02:56.838
they didn't go without a fight.

02:59.967 --> 03:01.844
Set a course for Keto-Enol.

03:15.527 --> 03:16.926
I'll be right back.

03:41.447 --> 03:42.402
Captain.

03:44.207 --> 03:45.799
You in charge here?

03:46.167 --> 03:49.204
If you're not,
I need to speak to your superior officer.

03:56.167 --> 03:57.122
Captain?

03:59.407 --> 04:00.362
I'm okay.

04:01.847 --> 04:05.362
I'd stay quiet if I were you.
The guards don't like questions.

04:12.007 --> 04:14.043
Do you know where they're taking us?

04:16.726 --> 04:18.683
I heard something about Canamar.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.564
I assume that's where we're going.

04:21.687 --> 04:23.120
It's a penal colony.

04:26.527 --> 04:28.802
Is this how your justice system works?

04:28.927 --> 04:30.519
Ship people to prison without a trial?

04:30.647 --> 04:32.319
There's a processing station in orbit.

04:32.447 --> 04:35.120
You'll be tried, sentenced,
and sent down to the surface.

04:35.247 --> 04:36.646
What if you're not guilty?

04:36.767 --> 04:39.281
We're all guilty
as far as they're concerned.

04:40.967 --> 04:42.480
Why did they take you?

04:43.447 --> 04:44.960
They think we're smugglers.

04:45.087 --> 04:47.726
I wouldn't want to be
accused of smuggling.

04:47.847 --> 04:50.122
They'll probably make
an example of you.

05:06.287 --> 05:08.676
We're on an exploratory mission.

05:08.807 --> 05:11.037
We believe
our Captain and Chief Engineer...

05:11.167 --> 05:13.556
were abducted after visiting your planet.

05:14.327 --> 05:16.966
- Abducted by whom?
- We don't know.

05:17.807 --> 05:20.241
We're the busiest trading outpost
in this system.

05:20.367 --> 05:23.086
We get thousands of visitors every day.

05:23.207 --> 05:26.199
Unfortunately, that attracts just as many
thieves and smugglers.

05:26.327 --> 05:29.763
As you might imagine,
my officers are kept quite busy.

05:30.967 --> 05:32.559
I wish I could help you.

05:32.847 --> 05:34.485
Let us send you their descriptions.

05:34.607 --> 05:38.156
Perhaps you could find out
if any of your officers have seen them.

06:07.647 --> 06:09.319
Anything else on the menu?

06:13.647 --> 06:15.763
If you don't like it, give it to me.

06:19.927 --> 06:21.360
I like it just fine.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.116
Give it to me.

06:32.647 --> 06:33.796
Eat your own.

06:35.887 --> 06:37.559
You don't listen too well.

06:38.247 --> 06:41.876
Then why don't you save yourself
the trouble and stop talking to me?

06:55.887 --> 06:56.956
Thanks.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.916
You should be careful
with the Nausicaans.

07:09.647 --> 07:10.796
Nasty tempers.

07:12.447 --> 07:13.960
Thanks for the advice.

07:15.687 --> 07:17.405
What were you smuggling?

07:17.527 --> 07:19.677
Latinum, Enolian spice wine?

07:20.847 --> 07:22.280
We're not smugglers.

07:22.847 --> 07:25.805
I'm the chief engineer of a starship.
He's my captain.

07:26.327 --> 07:28.443
Captain of a starship?

07:29.127 --> 07:30.242
Interesting.

07:32.887 --> 07:36.277
I should've tried that when they took me.
It might have helped.

07:36.647 --> 07:38.603
Captain Zoumas.

07:57.487 --> 08:01.196
A patrol ship intercepted their shuttle
as it was leaving orbit.

08:02.047 --> 08:04.720
- Where are they?
- On board one of our transports.

08:05.047 --> 08:07.356
They were carrying
what appeared to be contraband...

08:07.487 --> 08:09.284
so they were taken into custody.

08:09.407 --> 08:12.285
Are your patrols in the habit
of arresting innocent people?

08:12.407 --> 08:14.557
Smuggling is rampant in this system.

08:14.687 --> 08:16.882
My men have orders
to board unfamiliar vessels.

08:17.007 --> 08:18.804
Mistakes can be made.

08:18.927 --> 08:21.043
You certainly made one this time.

08:21.807 --> 08:24.275
I've contacted the transport.
They're expecting you.

08:24.407 --> 08:26.443
These are the coordinates.

08:26.567 --> 08:30.196
I trust you'll accompany us
to ensure there are no further mistakes.

08:38.087 --> 08:40.236
What if Enterprise
doesn't find the Shuttlepod?

08:40.366 --> 08:42.756
Hopefully there'll be a judge or...

08:42.886 --> 08:45.640
someone on that processing station
we can talk to.

08:46.167 --> 08:47.236
And if not?

08:47.367 --> 08:50.200
You might want to make friends
with that Nausicaan.

08:57.367 --> 08:58.561
Are you Archer?

09:00.727 --> 09:04.606
You're being released.
A ship's coming to retrieve you.

09:04.727 --> 09:06.080
Released? Why?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.480
We're not criminals.

09:11.767 --> 09:13.997
How much did they pay you
to let them go?

09:14.127 --> 09:15.526
Quiet.

09:16.127 --> 09:18.800
I'm innocent, too. I'll pay you.

09:18.927 --> 09:21.077
I said, quiet.

09:21.207 --> 09:23.004
We're all innocent.

09:24.527 --> 09:25.801
How much?

09:27.247 --> 09:28.566
That's enough.

09:58.887 --> 10:02.482
Keep still, all of you,
if you want to get out of here.

10:54.687 --> 10:57.724
- I told you we needed the pilot.
- He's alive.

10:58.367 --> 11:01.598
Does he look like he's in any condition
to fly this ship?

11:01.727 --> 11:03.797
He tried to get a weapon.

11:03.927 --> 11:06.964
- Just watch them.
- What about the rest of us?

11:08.167 --> 11:12.001
- You'll be released soon enough.
- When? Where are we going?

11:12.287 --> 11:15.006
Be patient. You'll find out.

11:15.607 --> 11:18.485
I'm sure we're all grateful
for your courageous efforts...

11:18.607 --> 11:20.757
but we've been in these restraints
for three days.

11:20.887 --> 11:22.400
- Couldn't you...
- Quiet!

11:23.847 --> 11:25.963
I'll see if I can access navigation.

11:26.647 --> 11:28.603
You ever fly a warp ship before?

11:29.167 --> 11:31.158
- It's harder than you think.
- He's right.

11:31.287 --> 11:32.515
You hit the wrong control...

11:32.647 --> 11:34.638
you could overload
the plasma manifolds...

11:34.767 --> 11:37.235
or shut down
the antimatter containment field...

11:37.367 --> 11:39.961
we'd all end up a cloud of ionised gas.

11:41.207 --> 11:43.277
- You're a pilot?
- A damn good one.

11:45.367 --> 11:46.959
I'm a smuggler remember?

11:51.767 --> 11:52.916
Come with me.

12:00.767 --> 12:03.361
My partner's an engineer.
I could use his help.

12:03.487 --> 12:04.806
Just you.

12:29.487 --> 12:32.399
- I thought you were a pilot.
- Every ship's different.

12:33.967 --> 12:35.559
Just give me some time.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.003
These look like landing thrusters...

12:47.527 --> 12:48.926
attitude control...

12:49.967 --> 12:51.286
warp stabilisers.

12:52.087 --> 12:53.156
Navigation?

12:59.007 --> 13:00.156
Navigation.

13:00.287 --> 13:03.120
There's a binary system
four light-years from here.

13:09.207 --> 13:10.196
This one?

13:10.967 --> 13:12.446
- Set a course.
- Which planet?

13:12.567 --> 13:14.285
I'll tell you that when we get there.

13:14.407 --> 13:17.843
- We're not going to get very far...
- Just get me to that system.

13:45.767 --> 13:47.803
You know what happens if he dies?

13:49.887 --> 13:52.799
If you get him medical attention,
it'll work in your favour.

13:59.247 --> 14:01.841
I'll tell the magistrate
you showed compassion.

14:10.327 --> 14:12.921
The guard said
you were going to be released.

14:13.687 --> 14:14.642
Why?

14:15.967 --> 14:17.559
Because we're innocent.

14:19.007 --> 14:22.124
I have friends who wanted
to keep doing business with me.

14:23.047 --> 14:25.561
They made a few discreet payments,
and now...

14:26.487 --> 14:27.636
I'm innocent.

14:29.527 --> 14:33.281
I would've been off this ship by now
if you hadn't staged your little revolt.

14:33.767 --> 14:36.884
- I hope you've thought this through.
- Every detail.

14:38.647 --> 14:39.762
I'm curious.

14:40.727 --> 14:42.957
How'd you get out of those restraints?

14:44.847 --> 14:47.645
You couldn't have a lock pick.
The guards would have found it.

14:47.767 --> 14:49.200
Would they?

14:51.847 --> 14:55.806
Subdermal implants.
They depolarise triburnium alloys.

14:56.207 --> 14:58.402
How did you know
you were going to need them?

14:58.527 --> 15:01.246
I served seven years on Canamar
before I escaped.

15:02.247 --> 15:03.919
I don't intend to go back.

15:04.247 --> 15:06.283
So, I left prepared.

15:13.007 --> 15:15.885
I don't know what you've got in mind,
but I'm involved now.

15:16.007 --> 15:18.441
I don't want to go to Canamar
any more than you do.

15:19.327 --> 15:22.922
If we run into trouble,
my partner could help.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.762
- What is that?
- Subspace transceiver.

15:26.367 --> 15:28.801
I hope you're not trying
to send a message.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.918
I'm taking it off-line.

15:31.047 --> 15:32.878
It leaves a subspace signature.

15:33.007 --> 15:36.044
Even when it's not transmitting,
someone could track us.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.560
Now it's off-line.

15:54.447 --> 15:56.915
I'm picking up
an automated distress signal.

15:59.807 --> 16:03.277
- That's one of our frequencies.
- Your transport vessel?

16:03.407 --> 16:04.522
We have hundreds of ships.

16:04.647 --> 16:06.797
I don't know
the signatures for every one.

16:06.927 --> 16:09.964
The signal originated
near our rendezvous coordinates...

16:10.087 --> 16:12.123
but they've stopped transmitting.

16:12.887 --> 16:14.206
Try hailing them.

16:19.007 --> 16:20.122
No response.

16:21.847 --> 16:23.883
Increase our speed to warp 4.2.

16:24.007 --> 16:27.716
We're still several hours away
but we have patrol ships in that area.

16:29.207 --> 16:30.526
Contact them.

16:42.447 --> 16:44.756
- Have you ever tried Tojal?
- What?

16:44.887 --> 16:45.842
There's nothing like it.

16:45.967 --> 16:48.322
You have to eat it before it cools
or it'll congeal.

16:48.447 --> 16:49.482
Sounds terrific.

16:49.607 --> 16:52.519
It's the first thing I'm going to have
when we're off this ship.

16:52.647 --> 16:55.320
- Where do you think they're taking us?
- Ask him.

16:57.287 --> 16:59.039
I'll just wait and see.

16:59.167 --> 17:01.806
The Enolians won't stop looking for us.
We'll be fugitives.

17:01.927 --> 17:03.883
I was thinking of having
my face reconfigured.

17:04.007 --> 17:06.760
There's a surgeon on Burala Prime.
He can help you, too.

17:06.887 --> 17:08.479
I'll take my chances with my own face.

17:08.607 --> 17:11.040
- Have you ever been to Burala Prime?
- Can't say I have.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.599
If you go, avoid the polar islands.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.558
Friendly people
but the cold is unbearable.

17:14.686 --> 17:17.041
Only ice and glaciers.
I was there for three months...

17:17.166 --> 17:18.156
when my colleagues...

17:18.287 --> 17:19.720
- left without me.
- Imagine that.

17:19.847 --> 17:21.280
The day I got lost was the worst.

17:21.406 --> 17:25.002
14 hours. It took me 14 hours
to find my way back to the outpost.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.606
I lost three toes to frostbite.

17:26.727 --> 17:29.480
I've walked with a limp ever since,
not that you'd notice.

17:29.607 --> 17:32.201
I'm going to get that surgeon
to work on my foot as well.

17:32.327 --> 17:34.921
- Maybe he'll replace the missing toes.
- Excuse me...

17:36.127 --> 17:38.243
can I change seats?

17:42.087 --> 17:44.999
I'm surprised
we haven't crossed paths before.

17:47.087 --> 17:48.805
We're new to this region.

17:50.007 --> 17:52.316
We used to work mostly
in the Sol system.

17:53.727 --> 17:55.638
- Sol?
- That's our sun.

17:56.407 --> 17:58.318
Our homeworld is called Earth.

18:00.167 --> 18:01.202
What is it?

18:03.447 --> 18:06.484
- Two vessels approaching from aft.
- Let me see them.

18:11.727 --> 18:13.399
Enolian patrol ships.

18:21.087 --> 18:23.396
- They've found us.
- More quickly than I expected.

18:23.527 --> 18:25.757
When you were taking
the transceiver off-line...

18:25.887 --> 18:29.243
- you didn't activate it accidentally?
- You think I sent a distress call?

18:29.367 --> 18:32.757
I told you we should've gotten rid
of this ship. It's too easy to track.

18:34.487 --> 18:37.206
- They're charging weapons.
- Do the same.

18:37.327 --> 18:40.478
Those are heavily-armed patrol ships.
We're only a transport.

18:40.607 --> 18:42.086
We have weapons. Use them.

18:42.207 --> 18:45.358
We're outgunned.
I'd rather take my chances on Canamar.

18:46.287 --> 18:49.723
And I'd rather not.
Now charge the weapons.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.840
- They're targeting our engines.
- Return fire.

18:57.767 --> 19:00.122
- No.
- I'm warning you.

19:00.247 --> 19:01.760
We don't have the firepower.

19:01.887 --> 19:04.401
If we attack those ships,
they'll destroy us.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.997
I think I can get us out of this...

19:09.007 --> 19:10.804
but I'll need Tucker's help.

19:24.647 --> 19:25.602
What's happening?

19:25.727 --> 19:28.719
If those are patrol ships,
you're going to be recaptured.

19:28.847 --> 19:30.405
Shouldn't we get to the escape pods?

19:30.527 --> 19:33.360
The next person who speaks
goes out the airlock.

19:33.487 --> 19:35.079
He needs to concentrate.

19:42.087 --> 19:44.442
- Trip, what's your status?
- Almost there.

19:47.727 --> 19:50.685
Let us go.
I don't want to die tied up like an animal.

19:55.327 --> 19:56.726
Ready when you are.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.407
Cease fire, cease fire. We surrender.

20:08.687 --> 20:11.155
Pressurise your docking port
and prepare to be boarded...

20:11.287 --> 20:13.403
or our next shot will breach your hull.

20:13.527 --> 20:14.676
Acknowledged.

20:23.647 --> 20:24.602
Now.

20:26.327 --> 20:27.999
The plasma vents are open.

20:44.687 --> 20:46.120
They've taken damage.

20:46.247 --> 20:48.761
- Propulsion is down on both ships.
- Lock weapons.

20:48.887 --> 20:50.081
We should get out of here.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.118
- Target their warp reactors.
- There's no need.

20:52.247 --> 20:54.442
When they repair the damage
they'll come after us.

20:54.567 --> 20:58.560
You think the Enolians are going to give
up if we destroy two of their ships?

20:58.687 --> 21:02.646
All I'm wanted for is smuggling.
I don't need to add murder charges to it.

21:03.367 --> 21:05.039
Let me get us out of here.

21:05.767 --> 21:06.802
All right.

21:13.527 --> 21:15.165
Is this really necessary?

21:15.847 --> 21:18.725
I just saved your skin
and you still don't trust me.

21:19.447 --> 21:22.359
Do you know how much power
flows through those plasma circuits?

21:22.487 --> 21:23.636
How much?

21:25.727 --> 21:26.682
A lot.

21:28.687 --> 21:30.518
I could've been electrocuted.

21:31.407 --> 21:33.602
The least you could do is say thanks.

21:36.847 --> 21:37.802
Thanks.

21:42.167 --> 21:43.316
That was nice.

21:45.127 --> 21:47.721
- It reminds me of the time I was on...
- Shut up.

21:52.167 --> 21:55.079
Both our ships were disabled
before the transport escaped.

21:55.207 --> 21:58.517
My superiors don't want our patrols
taking any more chances.

21:58.647 --> 22:02.401
They've issued orders
to destroy the prison transport.

22:02.527 --> 22:05.758
Are your superiors aware that there are
two innocent humans aboard?

22:05.887 --> 22:08.560
They're more concerned with the man
who planned this escape.

22:08.687 --> 22:12.760
They were able to match his voice-print
to a prisoner named Kuroda Lor-ehn.

22:12.887 --> 22:15.560
He was responsible for many crimes,
some of them brutal.

22:15.687 --> 22:17.040
They're determined to stop him.

22:17.167 --> 22:19.203
And we're determined
to get our people back.

22:19.327 --> 22:22.046
Then I suggest you find them
before our patrols do.

22:28.087 --> 22:30.999
That was a clever trick,
igniting the plasma.

22:33.087 --> 22:34.679
I used it once before...

22:35.847 --> 22:38.156
outrunning a customs vessel
near Coridan.

22:39.767 --> 22:43.840
You obviously ran out of clever tricks.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

22:43.967 --> 22:45.116
What happened?

22:49.007 --> 22:53.046
Every ship leaving Keto-Enol
was being boarded and searched.

22:54.367 --> 22:55.686
To get through the checkpoint...

22:55.807 --> 22:59.163
I said I was a starship captain
and Tucker was my engineer.

23:00.727 --> 23:03.116
I made quite a point
about how I was on...

23:03.527 --> 23:05.643
a peaceful mission of exploration.

23:06.447 --> 23:09.803
- They didn't believe you?
- What do you think?

23:11.167 --> 23:13.362
They turned our shuttle inside out...

23:14.127 --> 23:15.446
found my cargo...

23:16.287 --> 23:17.766
and we wound up here.

23:18.927 --> 23:20.280
My good fortune.

23:21.607 --> 23:24.167
You should consider coming with us.

23:24.287 --> 23:27.359
- Your partner, too.
- Doing what?

23:28.727 --> 23:32.561
I have some business I wasn't able
to finish before I was arrested.

23:33.487 --> 23:35.159
It could be profitable.

23:36.727 --> 23:37.921
I'm a smuggler.

23:39.087 --> 23:41.442
- I'm not good at much else.
- Trust me...

23:42.287 --> 23:45.484
you'll be very interested
when you find out what I have in mind.

23:49.607 --> 23:52.280
It's not as if I have a lot of options
right now.

23:56.287 --> 23:58.517
But if we're going to work together...

23:59.167 --> 24:02.557
- I'd like to know where we're headed.
- The fourth planet.

24:02.807 --> 24:05.241
There's a trading outpost
called Tamaal.

24:05.367 --> 24:07.039
And then?

24:07.167 --> 24:09.158
A ship's going to meet us there.

24:09.287 --> 24:12.324
This transport
draws too much attention.

24:15.327 --> 24:17.602
Once you get past the texture,
they don't taste bad.

24:17.727 --> 24:19.524
The fun part
is keeping them in your mouth.

24:19.647 --> 24:21.365
They jump around
until you crunch down...

24:21.487 --> 24:22.442
Enough.

24:23.127 --> 24:24.719
- Is something wrong?
- No.

24:25.407 --> 24:27.967
I love hearing how delicious
Melvaran mud fleas are...

24:28.087 --> 24:31.045
or about the time you spent two hours
with an Orion slave girl...

24:31.167 --> 24:33.965
or the miracles doctors perform
getting rid of Fluvian fungus.

24:34.087 --> 24:37.045
- You think I want to hear your stories?
- I haven't told you any.

24:37.167 --> 24:39.442
You won't let me
get a word in edgewise.

24:39.887 --> 24:42.162
I can't even put my fingers in my ears.

24:42.767 --> 24:44.997
10 minutes that's all I'm asking.

24:45.127 --> 24:47.766
Just 10 minutes of silence.

24:49.767 --> 24:52.281
I didn't realise I was being so annoying.

24:52.407 --> 24:54.477
We seemed to be getting along so well.

24:54.607 --> 24:57.201
I thought it'd be nice to have
a pleasant conversation...

24:57.327 --> 25:00.205
before I spend the next 10 years
in a penal colony.

25:05.047 --> 25:06.002
Look...

25:07.447 --> 25:09.483
I'm sorry I snapped at you...

25:12.487 --> 25:15.320
but this isn't exactly
the best place to socialise.

25:22.367 --> 25:24.278
This thruster assembly
took a lot of damage.

25:24.407 --> 25:26.204
We should have Tucker take a look at it.

25:26.327 --> 25:27.646
Don't bother.

25:28.487 --> 25:30.637
You're not the one
who has to fly this thing.

25:30.767 --> 25:32.678
It won't be flying much longer.

25:37.607 --> 25:40.326
- I'm not hungry.
- You haven't eaten for two days.

25:41.287 --> 25:42.640
I can wait.

25:42.767 --> 25:46.077
- Don't be a fool.
- I said I'm not hungry.

25:54.967 --> 25:56.161
Prison rations.

25:59.687 --> 26:01.359
It's better than nothing.

26:01.487 --> 26:04.206
You obviously never spent time
on a penal colony.

26:05.087 --> 26:08.363
I was 14
when I first tasted those rations.

26:08.487 --> 26:10.955
I've had enough for one lifetime.

26:16.287 --> 26:20.644
Sounds like
you started your career early.

26:21.807 --> 26:22.922
I was young.

26:25.807 --> 26:28.401
- But I was no criminal.
- No?

26:29.367 --> 26:32.803
My father and I were working
at a transport yard on Keto-Enol.

26:32.927 --> 26:35.885
A supervisor accused me
of stealing a brace of latinum.

26:36.007 --> 26:37.235
I had nothing to do with it...

26:37.367 --> 26:39.835
but they couldn't find
anyone else to blame.

26:41.447 --> 26:44.564
I was sentenced to five years
at Duronom.

26:49.407 --> 26:51.079
That sounds pretty severe.

26:51.727 --> 26:54.116
Enolian guards are known
for their severity.

26:54.247 --> 26:56.477
Haven't you seen that by now?

26:58.167 --> 27:01.921
I learned far more in prison than
my father could have ever taught me.

27:03.127 --> 27:04.719
After I was released...

27:05.367 --> 27:07.483
I chose to put my new skills to use.

27:08.727 --> 27:10.763
I suppose I should be grateful.

27:11.407 --> 27:13.716
If it wasn't for the Enolian guard...

27:13.847 --> 27:15.803
my life...

27:15.927 --> 27:17.645
would have been quite dull.

27:31.967 --> 27:33.320
Welcome to Tamaal.

27:35.927 --> 27:38.316
- Where are your friends?
- They'll be here.

27:40.127 --> 27:43.517
- Do you have landing coordinates?
- We're not landing.

27:45.447 --> 27:47.324
They're going to dock with us.

27:50.007 --> 27:51.725
What about the others?

27:52.327 --> 27:54.795
- Are you going to let them go to prison?
- No.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.639
Before we leave...

27:59.767 --> 28:02.281
you are to set this ship
on a decaying orbit.

28:05.567 --> 28:07.285
It'll be incinerated.

28:07.407 --> 28:11.002
As far as anyone will be able to tell,
we crashed trying to land.

28:13.687 --> 28:16.326
Why kill all these people?
Just leave them.

28:16.967 --> 28:19.959
No one will be looking for us
if they think we're dead.

28:22.207 --> 28:25.836
If you don't like it
you can always go back to your seat.

28:25.967 --> 28:30.165
I may not know how to fly this ship, but
I'm sure I can figure out how to crash it.

28:48.927 --> 28:52.476
The transport's dropped out of warp.
It's entered a binary system.

28:53.127 --> 28:55.243
Looks like they're heading
for the fourth planet.

28:55.367 --> 28:56.402
Tamaal.

28:56.527 --> 28:59.997
It's a large trading outpost
with over two million inhabitants.

29:00.127 --> 29:02.357
A good place to get lost in the crowd.

29:04.767 --> 29:06.041
Drop to impulse.

29:07.087 --> 29:08.679
Take us into the system.

29:10.887 --> 29:12.479
Any human bio-signs?

29:13.367 --> 29:15.244
Two. It's them.

29:15.367 --> 29:18.040
I recommend we use the transporter
once we're in range.

29:18.167 --> 29:21.842
You're forgetting that's a prison ship.
It's heavily shielded.

29:29.567 --> 29:31.159
Where are you going?

29:31.287 --> 29:34.563
The docking hatch
was damaged by the patrol ships.

29:34.687 --> 29:37.281
Kuroda wants Tucker
to see if he can repair it.

29:47.127 --> 29:48.879
Nice of you to visit.

29:49.007 --> 29:52.124
- Who are we docking with?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

29:58.567 --> 30:02.276
He's taking us off on a shuttle.
Then he plans to crash the ship.

30:02.407 --> 30:04.125
I hope you've got
something else in mind.

30:04.247 --> 30:08.035
We can't wait for Enterprise.
We've got to try to take control.

30:09.887 --> 30:11.525
Think you can handle him?

30:13.367 --> 30:14.800
Yeah, piece of cake.

30:17.807 --> 30:20.321
There's a small vessel
dropping out of warp.

30:20.447 --> 30:22.756
- Patrol ship?
- I don't think so.

30:22.887 --> 30:26.323
- Four bio-signs. They're all Enolian.
- It's not one of our ships.

30:27.887 --> 30:28.842
Magnify.

30:30.767 --> 30:32.166
Where's it heading?

30:33.327 --> 30:34.999
The fourth planet.

30:35.127 --> 30:37.595
They're trying to hail
the prison transport.

30:37.967 --> 30:39.878
They're not getting a response.

30:42.967 --> 30:45.083
They may have come to rescue Kuroda.

30:47.687 --> 30:49.200
How heavily armed is it?

30:49.327 --> 30:52.285
Fore and aft particle cannons.
Nothing we can't handle.

31:02.487 --> 31:05.638
My friends will be here soon.
Lay in a descent course.

31:08.487 --> 31:11.638
Their ship might be big enough
to hold everyone here.

31:11.767 --> 31:14.804
- Why don't we take them along?
- We've already discussed this.

31:25.767 --> 31:26.995
Trip.

31:27.127 --> 31:29.038
How's that docking port coming?

31:33.047 --> 31:37.006
I need a minute. It's a big job.

31:38.167 --> 31:39.316
Do your best.

31:41.527 --> 31:42.482
Listen...

31:43.167 --> 31:46.318
I know we kind of got off on the wrong
foot. No hard feelings.

31:46.487 --> 31:49.285
But now that we're friends,
I could use a hand.

31:51.167 --> 31:53.158
- You're the engineer.
- True.

31:54.047 --> 31:57.119
But I'm having trouble
getting the intake valve open.

31:57.247 --> 31:59.636
I guess I don't have the muscle for it.

31:59.767 --> 32:03.476
Unless I'm mistaken,
Kuroda wants this hatch repaired.

32:08.967 --> 32:12.755
That one.
If you could turn it counterclockwise.

32:15.047 --> 32:16.480
Yeah, a little more.

32:17.607 --> 32:19.677
It's got to go at least 90 degrees.

32:23.647 --> 32:24.682
That's it.

32:28.167 --> 32:29.520
You almost got it.

32:32.847 --> 32:35.077
- What're you doing?
- They were going to let us go.

32:35.207 --> 32:37.562
They lied.
They're planning to kill you. All of you.

32:37.687 --> 32:38.836
How do you know that?

32:38.967 --> 32:40.605
You'll get us sent to Canamar.

32:40.727 --> 32:42.080
Keep it down.

32:45.927 --> 32:46.962
Stay here.

32:51.727 --> 32:52.762
Watch out.

33:03.007 --> 33:05.043
Do you know how to repair
that docking hatch?

33:05.167 --> 33:06.486
It's not easy.

33:08.247 --> 33:12.525
We're in a decaying orbit.
Shoot me and you'll die with the others.

33:18.127 --> 33:19.242
Get to work.

33:21.727 --> 33:24.195
- You don't have to kill these people.
- Move.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.120
You should thank me.

33:45.927 --> 33:46.916
What?

33:49.527 --> 33:50.516
Where's Archer?

33:50.647 --> 33:52.524
He's with them,
repairing the docking hatch.

33:52.647 --> 33:55.036
They said there's a shuttle
coming for us.

33:55.767 --> 33:59.077
I'm sorry I had to intervene,
but you didn't give me much choice.

33:59.207 --> 34:02.165
You're lucky they didn't kill you.
Kuroda was furious.

34:02.287 --> 34:05.324
But everything's fine now.
They're going to set us free.

34:07.127 --> 34:08.321
You're welcome.

34:14.367 --> 34:15.561
They've docked.

35:13.007 --> 35:15.601
- I see my message got through.
- Loud and clear, sir.

35:15.727 --> 35:17.957
Captain, would you mind?

35:18.087 --> 35:19.566
Who are these people?

35:23.327 --> 35:25.204
This will open the restraints.

35:28.607 --> 35:30.438
Get everyone on that shuttle.

35:53.087 --> 35:54.884
Let's go, come on.

35:58.527 --> 36:00.961
We've got to get out of here.
Let's go. Come on.

36:23.167 --> 36:24.122
Anything I can do?

36:24.247 --> 36:26.158
Not unless you have
a spare thruster assembly.

36:26.287 --> 36:28.005
- Is everyone off?
- Just about.

36:28.527 --> 36:29.960
I'll be right there.

36:43.487 --> 36:46.638
Captain, Travis says he can't maintain
the docking seal much longer.

36:46.767 --> 36:48.485
He won't have to. Let's go.

37:09.567 --> 37:11.239
We need to break orbit.

37:11.367 --> 37:14.245
- It's too late. We've lost thrusters.
- You're lying.

37:16.847 --> 37:18.326
We've got to get out.

38:28.687 --> 38:29.642
Kuroda.

38:31.887 --> 38:32.922
It's over.

38:33.567 --> 38:34.886
I won't go back!

38:38.687 --> 38:40.279
It's now or never, sir.

39:28.887 --> 39:31.162
We've got some men in there
who could use your help.

39:31.287 --> 39:32.925
- And you?
- I'll be fine.

39:33.047 --> 39:34.639
On behalf of the Enolian government...

39:34.767 --> 39:37.679
I'd like to extend our apologies
for this inconvenience.

39:37.807 --> 39:39.718
- My superiors will want...
- Trip.

39:41.207 --> 39:43.163
Captain?

39:44.687 --> 39:47.042
Captain, my superiors will want
a report on...

39:47.167 --> 39:50.762
I'll give you one now. Kuroda's dead.
The other 11 prisoners are under guard.

39:50.887 --> 39:53.640
As you're aware,
my engineer and I were falsely arrested.

39:53.767 --> 39:55.200
We almost wound up in Canamar.

39:55.327 --> 39:57.238
It makes me wonder how many others
don't belong there.

39:57.367 --> 39:59.085
You wanted a report?

39:59.767 --> 40:00.961
You've got one.
