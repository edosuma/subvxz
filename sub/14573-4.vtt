00:02.103 --> 00:03.837
(Jane whimpering)

00:05.173 --> 00:07.875
(screaming)

00:07.908 --> 00:09.677
(whimpering)

00:09.710 --> 00:11.112
No.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.249
(whimpering)

00:15.283 --> 00:17.585
(Louie)
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, you okay?

00:17.618 --> 00:19.353
I'm having
a scary dream.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.588
No, no,
no, no, no.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.922
You're awake now,
it's over now.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.391
It's over.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.262
No, I'm still
dreaming.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.998
But it's better now.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.600
Okay.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.368
Okay.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.569
There you go.

00:35.603 --> 00:36.604
Daddy?
Shh...

00:36.637 --> 00:37.871
Yeah.

00:37.905 --> 00:40.007
I'm having
a nice dream now.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.342
Okay, good.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.177
Keep having
a nice dream, okay?

00:43.211 --> 00:44.712
Yeah.
You promise?

00:44.745 --> 00:45.846
Got it.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.815
Okay, good.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.684
Goodnight.

00:50.718 --> 00:51.985
Goodnight, Daddy.
Love you.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.724
**

00:56.757 --> 00:57.791
(door closing)

00:59.227 --> 01:00.628
Dad, I forgot my science
notebook at your house.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.230
Okay.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.531
No, but I need it and I'm
going to Mom's house.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.465
I'll get it to
your mom later.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.866
What?
Daddy.

01:05.899 --> 01:06.800
Girls, do we know
the subway rules?

01:06.834 --> 01:08.102
Daddy.
Yes.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.137
Do we remember
the subway rules?

01:09.170 --> 01:10.771
What are they?
Daddy--

01:10.804 --> 01:13.107
Let's hear the subway--
just a second-- let's hear--

01:13.141 --> 01:15.109
I'm still dreaming.
Okay, come here, come here,
come here, come here.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.310
Daddy, I'm still
dreaming.

01:16.344 --> 01:17.811
What?
I'm still dreaming.

01:17.845 --> 01:18.979
This is all my dream,
it's really cool.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.648
It's almost
like real life.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.216
Okay, the subway
rules.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.551
If you get on
the train--
Wait, wait, wait.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.918
But-- okay,
if you get--

01:24.952 --> 01:26.654
Let's say you get on
the train--

01:26.687 --> 01:29.723
Let's say I get on
the train and you don't,

01:29.757 --> 01:32.160
you get somehow stuck on
the platform by yourself,

01:32.193 --> 01:34.428
what do you do?
Then we--

01:34.462 --> 01:35.763
we stay right there

01:35.796 --> 01:37.431
and then you'll come
back to us.

01:37.465 --> 01:38.766
That's right.
Stay in that
exact spot.

01:38.799 --> 01:39.933
You stay in
that exact spot

01:39.967 --> 01:41.001
and you don't
move, right?

01:41.034 --> 01:42.136
Right.
Bingo.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.172
Okay, what if
you get on the train

01:44.205 --> 01:45.806
and somehow I don't
get on the train?

01:45.839 --> 01:47.408
When you're alone on
the train, what do you do?

01:47.441 --> 01:48.842
We get off at
the next spot.
At the next stop.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.110
At the next stop.
What do you do there?

01:50.144 --> 01:51.279
And then we stay there

01:51.312 --> 01:52.913
and we don't let
anyone move us

01:52.946 --> 01:54.948
and we stay right there
until you come get us.
Ahh!

01:55.949 --> 01:56.984
Come on.

01:58.051 --> 01:59.220
This dream's cool.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.424
(wheels screeching)

02:03.457 --> 02:04.725
Ah, it's coming,
come on.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.262
Ba-ba-ba, come on.

02:08.296 --> 02:09.630
Go, go, go,
come on.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.267
Jane,
you're with me?
Yeah.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.635
Let's go.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.671
Get on, get on,
get on, get on.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.474
Okay.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.975
(exhaling)

02:22.009 --> 02:23.211
So what do you need from
your mom's house?

02:23.244 --> 02:24.212
You need your
science notebook.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.379
I need my
science notebook

02:25.413 --> 02:27.014
and I need it
for Wednesday.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.449
So if I get it to
you tomorrow, that's okay?

02:28.482 --> 02:29.950
Yeah.
Do you need
anything else?

02:29.983 --> 02:30.951
No, that's it.

02:30.984 --> 02:31.985
I need it by
Wednesday.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.887
By Wednesday?

02:33.921 --> 02:35.789
So if I get it to you
tomorrow, that's okay?
Yeah.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.591
(man)
Stand clear of
the closing doors, please.

02:38.559 --> 02:39.560
(door dinging)

02:39.593 --> 02:41.462
Jane, Jane!

02:41.495 --> 02:42.896
(Jane)
It's okay, Daddy.
Jane! Stop the train!

02:42.930 --> 02:43.964
Open the door!
It's okay, Daddy.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.666
I'm going to
stay right here.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.134
Jane, Jane!
(Jane)
I'll stay right here.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.369
It's my dream.
Jane!

02:48.402 --> 02:49.737
Jane!
I'll stay right here.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.172
Stop the train!

02:52.206 --> 02:53.807
Dad, Dad,
it's okay.
Stop the train!

02:53.841 --> 02:55.209
Dad!
Stop the train!

02:55.243 --> 02:56.410
Dad, it's okay,
she's going to be okay.

02:56.444 --> 02:57.745
Oh!
Remember the subway rules.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.179
The subway rules.
Oh!

02:59.213 --> 03:00.548
Remember the subway rules,
it's going to be--

03:00.581 --> 03:01.882
(bleep)
Dad!

03:01.915 --> 03:03.217
Goddamn it!
Dad, it's gonna be okay.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.418
Dad, stop.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.320
It's gonna be okay.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.188
Okay, she knows
the subway rules.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.156
We just went over them.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.391
It's going to
be okay.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.329
As soon as the doors open,

03:15.363 --> 03:16.664
we have to run--
get off that train.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.931
Fast.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.233
What are we gonna do
when we're--

03:19.267 --> 03:20.901
we're gonna go up
to the mezzanine,

03:20.934 --> 03:22.603
we're gonna go to
the downtown side,

03:22.636 --> 03:24.171
we're gonna get on the first
train coming back.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.706
We're gonna have to
come back downtown.

03:25.739 --> 03:26.907
Okay?

03:26.940 --> 03:27.908
And then we have to
go upstairs,

03:27.941 --> 03:29.176
we have to go outside,

03:29.209 --> 03:30.778
we have to cross
Lexington,

03:30.811 --> 03:31.779
we have to
go back downstairs

03:31.812 --> 03:33.281
and then we'll
find Jane.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.915
Come on, come on, come here,
come here, come here.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.287
Soon as these doors open,
we're running, you understand?

03:39.320 --> 03:40.888
Running.
Got it.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.158
Oh, Christ.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.064
What is wrong
with her?

03:52.433 --> 03:53.901
It's not her fault.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.737
(wheels screeching)

03:58.606 --> 04:00.274
**

04:02.976 --> 04:04.111
Come on, come on!

04:29.970 --> 04:32.139
Goddamn shit, goddamn shit,
goddamn shit.

04:33.441 --> 04:37.445
Shit, shit, shit...

04:37.478 --> 04:39.179
You shouldn't curse
in front of your daughter.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.615
Shit!

04:47.621 --> 04:49.156
(wheels screeching)

04:51.124 --> 04:53.093
What?
You're okay?

04:53.126 --> 04:54.628
Okay, love you,
love you, love you.

04:54.662 --> 04:55.663
Sorry.
Okay.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.964
Yeah, it's fine, Dad.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.503
(man)
Hey, are you okay?

05:02.536 --> 05:03.837
Are you lost?

05:03.871 --> 05:05.839
Well, my dad
told me to stay here.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.375
It was part of
the subway rules.

05:07.408 --> 05:12.279
Plus, this is all my dream,
so everything is okay.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.514
Your dream.

05:15.683 --> 05:16.950
**

05:16.984 --> 05:18.686
Let people off,
let people off, please!

05:25.926 --> 05:27.027
(horn honking)

05:29.363 --> 05:30.531
(groaning)

05:39.006 --> 05:41.074
**

05:45.913 --> 05:47.515
Jane, Jane!
(Jane)
Daddy!

05:47.548 --> 05:49.349
Daddy, it worked and this
is all part of my dream!

05:49.383 --> 05:51.652
No, this is not
a dream, Jane!

05:51.685 --> 05:52.853
It's not a dream!

05:52.886 --> 05:54.755
This is real!

05:54.788 --> 05:55.756
People get hurt!

05:55.789 --> 05:57.024
It's a dangerous
world!

05:57.057 --> 05:58.826
Kids get stolen!

05:58.859 --> 06:01.328
And they disappear
forever, Jane!

06:01.361 --> 06:02.530
This is real!

06:02.563 --> 06:04.698
Bad things happen!

06:04.732 --> 06:07.901
You can't do something
like that ever again!

06:07.935 --> 06:08.936
Just--
Dad, Dad.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.037
It's enough.
No!

06:10.070 --> 06:11.238
It's enough.
(crying)

06:11.271 --> 06:12.573
Go ahead and cry,
that's right!

06:12.606 --> 06:14.007
That's what
you should be doing!
No.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.543
You should be scared
and crying!

06:15.576 --> 06:16.844
Do you know what
could have happened?!

06:16.877 --> 06:17.778
No!

06:17.811 --> 06:19.179
It's not okay!

06:19.212 --> 06:20.848
Never do something
like that again!

06:20.881 --> 06:22.215
Never!

06:22.249 --> 06:24.351
Why did you do that?!

06:24.384 --> 06:27.087
Why did you do that,
Jane?!
I don't like this dream.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.890
This is a bad dream.
No, it's not
a good dream!

06:29.923 --> 06:31.959
You never do this
again!

06:35.295 --> 06:36.764
This is
a horrible dream.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.434
Come on,
we're taking a cab.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.401
I'm taking you to
your mom's.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.604
Go, come on,
come on.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.617
Hey.
Mommy.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.118
Hi.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.221
(Jane)
Hi, Patrick.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.724
Hi, Patrick.
Patrick.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.225
Hi, Louie.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.728
Hey, um...

07:07.761 --> 07:09.963
something happened,
we had a thing happen.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.599
What happened?

07:11.632 --> 07:14.301
First of all, last night,
Jane had a bad dream.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.469
Yeah, she gets those.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.237
No, so...

07:17.270 --> 07:19.139
but then this morning, she
says she's still dreaming.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.340
Like she's saying how

07:20.373 --> 07:21.509
everything is
part of her dream.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.610
That, she's just
being creative--

07:22.643 --> 07:24.945
So then we're on
the subway

07:24.978 --> 07:27.080
and right before
the doors close--

07:27.114 --> 07:31.018
* The craziest...
lined up today *

07:32.986 --> 07:34.421
* And the thing
that would please me *

07:34.454 --> 07:35.756
* Oh yeah baby

07:35.789 --> 07:38.492
* I just want to
know what to do *

07:41.394 --> 07:42.630
* 'Cause you-- *

07:42.663 --> 07:44.197
Jane?

07:44.231 --> 07:45.265
Jane?!

07:45.298 --> 07:47.434
Stop, Jane.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.202
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

07:49.236 --> 07:50.671
You tell me
something right now.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.274
Is this a dream?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.877
Are we in your
dream right now?

07:56.910 --> 07:58.111
No, Mommy.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.379
Is it true what
your dad said,

07:59.412 --> 08:02.115
what you did
on the subway?

08:02.149 --> 08:03.183
Yes, Mommy.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.685
Sorry, Mommy.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.221
You go to your room
right now.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.060
Okay.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.361
Let's go, huh?

08:20.033 --> 08:23.503
(breathing heavily)

08:31.378 --> 08:32.680
Yeah.

08:32.713 --> 08:33.681
Yeah...

08:33.714 --> 08:35.348
(scoffing)

08:37.718 --> 08:39.052
(nervously chuckling)

08:43.056 --> 08:44.191
(inhaling deeply)

08:49.229 --> 08:50.998
(clearing throat)

08:51.031 --> 08:52.432
Okay?

08:54.201 --> 08:55.235
Uh-huh.

08:56.737 --> 08:57.838
All right, I'll talk
to you later.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.539
Uh-huh.

08:59.573 --> 09:00.774
Yep.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.484
**

09:13.987 --> 09:15.122
(horn honking)

10:19.152 --> 10:20.220
(clanking)

10:21.521 --> 10:22.522
(speaking foreign language)

10:27.861 --> 10:29.029
Oh...

10:39.372 --> 10:40.708
(elevator bell ringing)

10:41.709 --> 10:42.876
(ringing continues)

10:44.845 --> 10:46.379
(ringing continues)

10:49.249 --> 10:50.718
What happened?
(ringing continues)

10:50.751 --> 10:51.819
I don't--
I don't know.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.286
What'd you do?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.022
I just pressed
the elevator button.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.289
Help!

10:56.323 --> 10:57.725
(elevator bell ringing)

10:57.758 --> 10:59.126
Someone's stuck.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.227
Oh, shit.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.964
Hey!

11:03.997 --> 11:05.532
Hello!

11:05.565 --> 11:07.167

11:07.200 --> 11:09.036
Help, I'm st--
(man)
Hello!

11:09.069 --> 11:11.338
I'm stuck!
Who's in there?

11:11.371 --> 11:13.640
Okay, well, don't
ring the bell no more.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.042
Just hold on.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.676
You hold on here.

11:16.710 --> 11:17.677
(woman)
Hello?

11:17.711 --> 11:18.746
Hello?

11:18.779 --> 11:20.013
Help!

11:20.047 --> 11:22.382
Uh, he's coming
right back.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.517
I'm afraid!

11:24.551 --> 11:26.553
You're fine.

11:26.586 --> 11:27.988
No, I'm not fine.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.723
I'm stuck.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.358
Well, yeah.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.993
You...

11:33.026 --> 11:34.261
Hold this.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.399
(grunting)

11:41.134 --> 11:42.235
Hello?

11:42.269 --> 11:43.771
Can you get me
out of here?

11:43.804 --> 11:45.505
No, not right now!

11:45.538 --> 11:46.673
Why not?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.408
I can't move this
elevator.

11:48.441 --> 11:51.011
I gotta call
the fire department.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.579
Can't you just get
her out through--
No, no, no, no.

11:52.612 --> 11:55.415
That's how you
get cut in half, see?

11:55.448 --> 11:56.750
The elevator moves,

11:56.784 --> 11:58.585
and she gets out
partway...

11:58.618 --> 12:00.720
(imitating slicing)

12:00.754 --> 12:04.091
I seen a guy cut
in half like a fish.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.759
Hold on here.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.060
I gotta go
call fire...

12:07.094 --> 12:08.261
Hello?

12:08.295 --> 12:10.764
Hello,
is someone there?

12:10.798 --> 12:13.266
Uh, yeah,
he's coming right back.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.302
He's just calling
the fire department.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.104
Can you help me?

12:17.137 --> 12:18.571
I can't get you
out of there.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.974
But can you help me?

12:21.008 --> 12:22.609
How?

12:22.642 --> 12:24.477
I need my medication.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.579
It's very important.

12:26.613 --> 12:31.819
If-- if-- if you go to
my apartment, it's 2B.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.887
Can you help me?

12:33.921 --> 12:34.822
Okay.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.824
I will give you
my keys.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.893
And, um, if you
go in my kitchen,

12:39.927 --> 12:42.562
on the counter is
my pills.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.763
Okay.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.265
I need them now.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.766
I'm sorry.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.570
I'll be right back.

Mrs. Pee-Pee Face **

13:41.855 --> 13:43.056
(whimpering)

14:09.616 --> 14:12.319
I called
the fire department!

14:12.352 --> 14:14.721
They're sending
someone over!

14:14.754 --> 14:16.856
Please don't
shout at me.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.691
I'm not shouting!

14:18.725 --> 14:22.095
I'm talking loud enough
so you can hear me in there!

14:23.063 --> 14:24.864
Oh, good, you're back.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.033
Wha...

14:26.066 --> 14:27.400
Oh, hello?

14:27.434 --> 14:30.103
Uh, hi, I got--
I got your pills.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.939
Oh, thank you so much.

14:31.972 --> 14:32.906
Okay.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.507
God bless you.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.177
All right, well,
so you're okay now, right?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.946
Well...

14:38.979 --> 14:42.682
It's awful being
trapped in here alone.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.086
Well, try to, uh,
try not to think about it.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.088
Try to think of
something else.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.257
You know, like pretend,
uh...

14:50.290 --> 14:52.525
you're in, uh,
you're not stuck.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.227
You're in a little
waiting room

14:54.261 --> 14:56.529
with no chairs
and no windows

14:56.563 --> 14:58.698
like on purpose.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.767
You're very kind.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.036
All right, well,
he's gonna be back soon

15:03.070 --> 15:04.571
with the fire department.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.139
Yeah.

15:06.173 --> 15:09.776
All right, well, you don't
have to stay here with me.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.712
I'll be fine.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.981
Thank you.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.282
Thank you very much.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.050
Okay.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.418
Hey, by the way,

15:18.451 --> 15:20.620
there's a woman
in your apartment.

15:20.653 --> 15:21.921
She's asleep
on the sofa.
Oh!

15:21.955 --> 15:23.823
That's my niece.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.592
I did not know
that she was home.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.595
Oh, please, can you go and
ask her to wait with me?

15:28.628 --> 15:29.829
Please?
Uh, sure.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.131
But she was sleeping.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.633
Oh, for heaven's sake,
wake her.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.202
You still
have my keys.

15:36.836 --> 15:37.804
Yeah, I do.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.106
Okay.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.173
All right,
I'll be right back.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.549
Hello.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.420
Hello, hello?

15:53.453 --> 15:54.554
Hello.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.159
(keys jangling)

15:59.192 --> 16:00.393
Hello.

16:03.396 --> 16:06.633
Uh, hi.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.934
You're kind of naked.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.569
I don't want to
touch you.

16:13.573 --> 16:14.574
(whistling)

16:34.694 --> 16:36.296
Hello, hello, come on.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.898
Hello, hello,
hello.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.102
All right.

16:49.076 --> 16:52.679

16:52.712 --> 16:53.846
No, no, no!
Your aunt!

16:53.880 --> 16:55.582
Your aunt...
(shouting continues)

16:55.615 --> 16:56.549
... is on the elevator!

16:56.583 --> 16:58.351
Your aunt is
in the elevator!

16:58.385 --> 16:59.986
Your aunt is in
the elevator!
(shouting continues)

17:00.019 --> 17:01.488

Your aunt is in

Let's just eat.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.440
Oh my God.

19:34.407 --> 19:37.744
I love, uh...
women.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.146
Not all of them.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.615
But usually when I love
somebody, it's a woman.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.084
How do you know
you love somebody?

19:45.117 --> 19:46.353
That's a good question.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.854
How do you know you
love somebody?

19:47.887 --> 19:49.088
You know you love somebody

19:49.121 --> 19:51.724
when you share your
innermost...

19:51.758 --> 19:54.694
secret racism with them.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.696
That's...

19:56.729 --> 19:59.732
that's when you
really know...

19:59.766 --> 20:01.401
when you finally come out

20:01.434 --> 20:04.103
and say, "All right,
there's this black guy at work

20:04.136 --> 20:06.606
"and, uh...

20:06.639 --> 20:08.308
Actually, you know what,
both black guys at work."

20:14.046 --> 20:15.515
I have two daughters,

20:15.548 --> 20:19.752
so I'm raising two future women,
you know?

20:19.786 --> 20:21.187
Maybe.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.923
I mean, one of them might
be a guy later.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.358
It's possible.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.759
It could happen.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.261
Someday, one of my
daughters will say,

20:28.295 --> 20:30.797
"Dad, I'm really a guy."

20:30.830 --> 20:32.198
And I'll be like,
"All right, well,

20:32.231 --> 20:33.933
"let's get you a dick.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.436
"Let's get
you a dick, honey.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.139
"We're going to get you
the nicest dick in town.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.844
Nothing is too good
for my little girl."
