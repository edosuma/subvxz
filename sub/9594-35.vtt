WEBVTT

00:23.724 --> 00:26.694
The H.I.V.E.!
This'll only take a minute!

00:26.727 --> 00:28.062
Titans, go!

00:30.398 --> 00:31.565
'Sup, guys?

00:34.302 --> 00:35.536
Kid Flash.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.405
He's so fast!

00:37.438 --> 00:40.308
Ooh, he moves like the
dashing Glorblax.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.181
Looks at those blurs, yo!

00:47.215 --> 00:48.549
He's the blurriest!

00:54.255 --> 00:55.723
Mmm.
Love that breeze.

01:08.469 --> 01:09.737
It's not that amazing.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.772
I mean, it's easy
to be good at only one...

01:11.805 --> 01:12.706
...thing.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.342
I was just passin' through,

01:14.375 --> 01:15.576
thought you guys
might need a hand.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.878
Yeah, we do!
Can you get me a burrito

01:17.911 --> 01:19.480
from Mexico?

01:19.513 --> 01:20.714
Quick. Build me something
that takes a long time.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.451
Or perhaps find my
lost bracelets.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.286
Hey! I wants a penguin!

01:25.319 --> 01:26.620
Immediately!

01:27.721 --> 01:28.656
Whoa, guys!

01:28.689 --> 01:31.192
I can't do all that stuff!

01:31.225 --> 01:32.326
Just kidding!

01:32.360 --> 01:33.561
-Yay!

01:33.594 --> 01:34.862
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:34.895 --> 01:37.431
Yeah!
Woot-woot!

01:37.465 --> 01:38.866
Yeah, boy!

01:38.899 --> 01:41.202
Just passing through, huh?

01:41.235 --> 01:42.703
Right.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.373
You got me. I'm actually here
to try out for the Titans.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.241
-You're in!

01:47.275 --> 01:49.577
You would be amazing!

01:49.610 --> 01:51.312
You can bunk with me, dude!

01:51.345 --> 01:53.514
So good, so fast.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.849
Yeah, and I say no!

01:55.883 --> 01:57.651
He's a one-trick pony!

01:59.853 --> 02:01.822
And there's no place on the
Titans for one-trick ponies!

02:01.855 --> 02:04.325
You're right, Robin.
Speed is my only power.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.493
Hat from Russia!

02:05.526 --> 02:07.228
But it's a pretty cool power!

02:07.261 --> 02:08.762
Anybody can run that fast.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.664
-Uh, you couldn't.
-Yeah.

02:10.698 --> 02:14.235
If I'm a one-trick pony,
then that makes you
a no-trick pony.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.669
I am a multiple-trick pony!

02:15.703 --> 02:17.838
A master of sweet ninja moves!

02:18.939 --> 02:20.208
A natural born leader.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.476
Titans, follow my
train of thought here.
And after that...

02:24.478 --> 02:25.913
A detective.
Hmm.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.515
Mmm?
Hmm.

02:32.220 --> 02:35.256
I possess...
the tightest butt cheeks
of any Titan.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.524
Ooh!

02:36.557 --> 02:38.526
And, I'm a master beat boxer!

02:43.297 --> 02:44.898
Look, you may be good
at a lot of things,

02:44.932 --> 02:46.900
but you still couldn't
beat me in a race.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.269
I believe I could.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.470
And if I win,

02:49.503 --> 02:51.505
you have to stop running.
Forever!

02:51.539 --> 02:54.242
And if you win,
you get to lead the Titans.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.978
-Well then, let's do it.
-Fine.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.547
Give me one week.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.815
I'm going to need to train.

03:01.849 --> 03:05.286
ROBIN: Yeah! Come on!
You can do it!
You can do anything!

03:05.319 --> 03:06.620
I believe in you!

03:06.654 --> 03:07.821
This is the training?

03:07.855 --> 03:09.890
Yes!
Training so hard now!

03:09.923 --> 03:13.427
I believe! This is the face of
the fastest man alive!

03:13.461 --> 03:14.995
That's not gonna
make you faster.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.330
Oh, yeah?
Check this out.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.267
Whoa! I didn't even see
my hand go by.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.935
Shouldn't you actually, like,
be running or something?

03:21.969 --> 03:24.505
Kid Flash has the power
of super speed, bruh.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.640
But, but, but!
I have the ultimate power!

03:26.674 --> 03:27.841
I believe in myself!

03:27.875 --> 03:29.877
Believing in yourself
isn't a power.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.713
Of course it is,
my under-developed underlings.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.948
ROBIN: You see,
by believing in what we want,

03:34.982 --> 03:37.751
we send mind-waves
into outer space,

03:37.785 --> 03:40.020
where it comes true
and is sent back to us.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.655
It's simple science.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.358
Beast Boy! How many burritos
can you eat in one day?

03:44.392 --> 03:46.860
Hmm. My tummy
gets angry at about 20.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.029
Believe in yourself,
and you can triple that!

03:50.498 --> 03:52.533
Raven, if you would just
believe in yourself,

03:52.566 --> 03:54.402
-you could fly!
-I can fly.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.003
Now you're getting it!

03:56.036 --> 03:58.772
Cyborg. You don't think
you can pull off a fedora,
do you?

03:58.806 --> 04:01.409
Of course not!
My head's the wrong shape.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.377
Believe!

04:03.411 --> 04:04.612
Whoa!

04:04.645 --> 04:05.946
Lookin' good, brah!

04:05.979 --> 04:07.515
I believe I am!

04:07.548 --> 04:09.883
Star!
Believe in yourself.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.353
And you too
can achieve your dreams!

04:12.386 --> 04:13.487
Ooh!

04:18.659 --> 04:20.494
Is the believing in oneself

04:20.528 --> 04:22.563
truly a superpower?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.332
If you... believe!

04:28.336 --> 04:30.338
You don't stand a chance,
Kid Flash.

04:30.371 --> 04:35.309
Yeah.
You may be fast, but Robin
believes in himself!

04:35.343 --> 04:36.544
Hope you brought an appetite,

04:36.577 --> 04:38.779
'cos you're about to
eat some dust!

04:44.618 --> 04:45.986
On your mark!

04:46.019 --> 04:47.555
May the fastest man win.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.423
I plan to.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.624
Get set!

04:57.230 --> 05:00.568
Believe, believe!
Believe, believe, believe!

05:02.970 --> 05:04.938
Believe. What?

05:04.972 --> 05:06.740
I believe I won.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.410
Yeah, but my cape was
slowing me down! Rematch!

05:09.443 --> 05:10.611
Sure.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.418
-Believe!

05:17.451 --> 05:18.686
Three out of five!

05:25.125 --> 05:27.094
Ha! It's a tie!
I won!

05:27.127 --> 05:30.431
Actually, according to the
photo finish, Kid Flash won.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.666
Kid Flash

05:32.700 --> 05:33.934
Several times.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.570
Don't worry. I still believe.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.071
In our new leader!

05:39.473 --> 05:41.775
STARFIRE: You were so great...
RAVEN:
I knew you could do it...

05:41.809 --> 05:43.711
-BEAST BOY:
Gosh, you're gonna be...
-I guess I'll, uh...

05:43.744 --> 05:45.613
See you guys around.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.915
Ah, what's the
point in moving?

06:21.949 --> 06:24.418
I'll just be slower than
Kid Flash anyway.

06:26.654 --> 06:29.122
Hey

06:29.156 --> 06:31.158
If believing in myself
isn't a real power,

06:31.191 --> 06:33.126
then I'm the worst
of all ponies!

06:33.160 --> 06:34.795
I'm a no-trick pony!

06:34.828 --> 06:36.029
What are you talking about?

06:36.063 --> 06:37.931
You're the trickiest pony
out there!

06:37.965 --> 06:39.600
Stop trying to cheer me up.

06:39.633 --> 06:43.737
I'm just a slow, no-trick pony
with flabby butt cheeks.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.839
So, some guy
is faster than you,

06:45.873 --> 06:48.576
you're better than him
at so many other things.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.044
And it wasn't because
you believed in yourself,

06:51.078 --> 06:53.714
it was because
you worked hard.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.216
So... my ninja moves
are still sweet?

06:56.249 --> 06:57.585
Super sweet.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.587
And I'm a master beatboxer?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.221
Yeah, you're not bad.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.923
And my butt cheeks?

07:02.956 --> 07:04.658
The tightest. Mmm-hmm.

07:04.692 --> 07:08.061
It would take years
for Kid Flash to master
all your tricks.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.564
I reckon you got
the juice, kid.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.966
You're right!
I may have lost,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.837
but I am still a
multiple-trick pony!

07:23.911 --> 07:26.079
Hey, Robin.
What are you doing here?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.816
I've come to take back
the Titans.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.553
Actually, we kinda like
Kid Flash as our leader.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.087
But he's a one-trick pony!

07:34.121 --> 07:35.889
-He can't do half the
stuff I can do.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.224
Oh, excuse me.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.693
Had to save a Norwegian family
from drowning.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.861
-Whoops! Sorry, one sec.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.530
Disarmed a doomsday device.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.897
CYBORG:
You are so cool!

07:43.931 --> 07:46.166
BEAST BOY: Awesome as usual!
STARFIRE: Marry me!

07:47.735 --> 07:49.102
All right, One-Trick,

07:49.136 --> 07:51.772
you may be fast, and cool,
and all-around amazing,

07:51.805 --> 07:54.107
but can you...
beatbox like this?

08:07.688 --> 08:09.222
Back to you.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.234
Starting again.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.975
Both fingers your way.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.177
But...
that's impossible!

08:30.210 --> 08:32.846
What you're doing
takes years of training!

08:32.880 --> 08:34.014
Usually, usually.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.583
But thanks to
believing in myself,

08:35.616 --> 08:37.951
and super speed,
it only took three minutes.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.186
Now, not only can I beatbox,

08:39.219 --> 08:41.154
but check out my
sweet ninja moves.

08:44.792 --> 08:45.993
And these butt cheeks.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.294
'Cause they're tight!

08:49.897 --> 08:50.998
All right.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.834
You win.
The Titans are yours.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.603
On one condition.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.837
A condition?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.205
I'm better than you at
everything now.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.172
Not everything!

08:59.206 --> 09:02.542
You can lead the Titans
if you beat me in a...

09:03.811 --> 09:04.778
Foot race!

09:04.812 --> 09:06.013
What?

09:12.820 --> 09:16.790
Isn't you losing a race to
this guy how this all started?

09:16.824 --> 09:18.659
This time is going
to be different!

09:18.692 --> 09:22.095
This time I'm believing
in myself more than I ever
have before!

09:22.129 --> 09:24.865
Okay. I thought we established
that didn't work.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.901
CYBORG: On your mark.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.804
Get set!

09:30.838 --> 09:32.239
Yeah, Kid Flash!

09:32.272 --> 09:34.107
He is so dreamy!

09:35.876 --> 09:37.344
Believe!

09:40.413 --> 09:41.882
Ow! Ow! Ow!

09:41.915 --> 09:43.250
Oh, did I hear something rip?

09:51.825 --> 09:53.661
Look at him go!

09:56.296 --> 09:58.231
He's doing it!

09:58.265 --> 10:01.034
He's...
He's really doing it!

10:13.246 --> 10:14.815
Believe!

10:14.848 --> 10:17.017
I believe!

10:19.753 --> 10:21.188
Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:21.221 --> 10:22.923
I need ice! It's swelling!
