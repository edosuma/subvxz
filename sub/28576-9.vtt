00:02.634 --> 00:03.814
Previously on Harrow...

00:03.874 --> 00:05.414
Do you know why
Harrow was suspended?

00:05.474 --> 00:07.574
Maxine doesn't do anything
without good reason.

00:07.634 --> 00:10.854
He forged my signature.
No-one's digging up anything.

00:10.914 --> 00:13.094
You wanted proof
that I wasn't dead, right?

00:13.154 --> 00:15.014
Whose body was it?
It wasn't mine.

00:15.074 --> 00:18.934
Despite your drunken friend,
Laurie Badcoe, signing that it was.

00:18.994 --> 00:20.974
Why are you doing this?
You ruined my life.

00:21.034 --> 00:23.214
Maxine and I found
a piece of evidence

00:23.274 --> 00:25.894
that put Chester at every murder
he'd committed.

00:25.954 --> 00:27.334
Sometimes, we have to trust

00:27.394 --> 00:29.134
that the other is doing
the right thing.

00:29.194 --> 00:31.854
Are you curious
how your daughter's doing?

00:31.914 --> 00:33.454
Don't go to the Bettie.
It's not safe.

00:33.514 --> 00:34.774
I think that could be him.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.454
I'm gonna send you
a photo of him, OK?

00:41.194 --> 00:43.214
Jesus Christ, Harrow.

00:43.274 --> 00:45.574
What the hell has gone on here?

00:48.634 --> 00:50.174
No.

00:50.234 --> 00:52.894
No, no, no, no.
Th... This isn't right.

00:52.954 --> 00:54.774
You'd better
explain yourself, Harrow.

00:56.714 --> 00:59.694
I was inside that coffin.

00:59.754 --> 01:01.174
He put me in there.

01:01.234 --> 01:03.854
Who? Francis Chester.

01:05.434 --> 01:09.454
He injected me with something here,
into my arm.

01:10.594 --> 01:13.694
And when I woke up,
I was in that grave.

01:13.754 --> 01:16.894
He buried me alive, Bryan.
He wanted me dead.

01:16.954 --> 01:18.454
So, Chester dug this hole.

01:18.514 --> 01:21.014
No. No, I did that.

01:21.074 --> 01:23.694
Jesus Christ. I was right.

01:23.754 --> 01:27.814
Chester's body's not in there
because he's not dead.

01:27.874 --> 01:29.734
Harrow... Just look inside.

01:29.794 --> 01:32.454
You'll see...
everything I've told you is true.

01:32.514 --> 01:33.894
No! No. No.

01:33.954 --> 01:37.054
No-one's to touch that until
Scenes of Crime get here, alright?

01:37.114 --> 01:39.254
Get... Harrow, get the hell
out of there.

01:39.314 --> 01:41.334
Harrow...
I'm telling you, he's alive.

01:41.394 --> 01:43.194
- Have you lost your mind?
- Get out of there.

01:43.218 --> 01:44.694
I'm gonna call for back-up.

01:44.754 --> 01:47.014
This... coffin is empty!

01:47.074 --> 01:49.054
Harrow, don't do this!

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

02:41.594 --> 02:43.294
OK, lock it down. I'm onto it.

02:43.354 --> 02:44.854
You're coming with me.

02:44.914 --> 02:48.334
He must have put the body back inside
after he dug me up.

02:48.394 --> 02:50.254
Hang on. So, what,
now you're saying

02:50.314 --> 02:52.595
there was a body in the coffin
before you were put inside?

02:52.619 --> 02:54.334
I don't know.

02:54.394 --> 02:57.934
He injected me before I had
a chance to find out.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.494
Look, I need a blood test.

03:00.554 --> 03:02.734
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

03:02.794 --> 03:05.254
Interfering with a corpse
is a criminal offence.

03:05.314 --> 03:06.530
You could do jail time for this.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.134
What - that's what
you're worried about?

03:08.194 --> 03:10.314
You're what I'm worried about!
I'm not making this up!

03:10.338 --> 03:12.094
Look, I... I want to help you.

03:12.154 --> 03:14.014
But look at it from my side, Harrow.

03:14.074 --> 03:16.374
It just doesn't make any sense!

03:16.434 --> 03:18.674
Why would Chester go to
all the trouble of digging you up

03:18.714 --> 03:20.134
after burying you?

03:22.714 --> 03:25.374
Because he didn't kill Fern.

03:25.434 --> 03:26.814
What?

03:26.874 --> 03:29.814
There was a phone with me
inside the coffin.

03:29.874 --> 03:31.374
He showed me footage.

03:31.434 --> 03:33.774
He tried to kill Fern on the Bettie.

03:33.834 --> 03:35.694
He wanted me to watch her die.

03:35.754 --> 03:38.294
Well, where's that phone now?
I don't know.

03:39.354 --> 03:40.354
Look, Fern got away.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.934
That's why he dug me back up.

03:42.994 --> 03:45.014
He wants me to suffer.

03:45.074 --> 03:47.654
He said he'd take away
everything that I hold dear,

03:47.714 --> 03:49.294
and he meant it.

03:50.754 --> 03:53.534
Bryan, please, you have to call her.

03:58.194 --> 04:00.054
Well, I don't need to.

04:01.754 --> 04:03.454
She's already at CIB.

04:07.154 --> 04:08.734
Hey, this is Callan.

04:08.794 --> 04:10.894
Leave a message
if you're good-looking.

04:10.954 --> 04:13.854
Cal, it's me. Can you give me a call
as soon as you get this?

04:13.914 --> 04:15.254
Thanks.

04:16.954 --> 04:18.853
He's not answering.

04:25.234 --> 04:28.014
Keep the pressure on his head.
We'll just get him in real quick.

04:28.074 --> 04:29.734
Right. Here we go.

04:34.034 --> 04:35.894
Dad!

04:35.954 --> 04:38.174
Thank God!

04:38.234 --> 04:41.974
Thank God you're OK!
I'm so sorry this happened.

04:42.034 --> 04:44.454
I should never have doubted myself.
Fern?

04:45.634 --> 04:47.014
Why are you here?

04:47.074 --> 04:49.534
Because Francis Chester
tried to kill me.

04:51.874 --> 04:54.734
OK. I need to speak to Fern alone.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.734
Sure. But I need that blood test.

04:56.794 --> 04:59.694
Whatever Chester injected me with
is already being metabolised.

04:59.754 --> 05:01.174
And we will get it organised,

05:01.234 --> 05:03.114
but right now, I need to
speak to your daughter.

05:03.138 --> 05:04.174
You wait here. Dad...

05:04.234 --> 05:06.574
She's telling the truth.
Come on.

05:09.194 --> 05:10.694
What the hell?

05:10.754 --> 05:12.094
You smell!

05:12.154 --> 05:13.574
What's happened?

05:15.394 --> 05:18.294
I dug up Chester's grave.
You what?

05:21.474 --> 05:23.694
And... was it empty?

05:24.594 --> 05:27.454
Look, I can't stay.
I need to get this blood test.

05:27.514 --> 05:29.254
Look, I'll call you.

05:29.314 --> 05:31.574
Don't let her out of your sight.

05:33.234 --> 05:36.294
Dr Harrow? Detective Nichols
asked you to wait here.

05:36.354 --> 05:38.614
Am I being charged with anything.

05:40.314 --> 05:42.014
Then I'm leaving.

05:43.274 --> 05:45.174
Try being married to him.

05:45.234 --> 05:46.694
Were you injured?

05:46.754 --> 05:48.014
No.

05:50.154 --> 05:51.854
Did this man touch you?

05:51.914 --> 05:54.774
No, but he had a syringe in
his hand. It was Francis Chester!

05:54.834 --> 05:57.294
So, you got a good look at him?
Well, it was... it was dark.

05:57.354 --> 06:01.174
But I'm pretty sure it was the same
guy I saw on my dad's laptop files.

06:02.234 --> 06:06.494
But you didn't see those files until
after you got out of the Bettie.

06:06.554 --> 06:07.974
Yes, that's right.

06:10.114 --> 06:12.574
It was him! It was Francis Chester!

06:12.634 --> 06:14.494
Fern, I really want to believe you.

06:15.514 --> 06:18.134
But I... I don't have any proof.

06:18.194 --> 06:19.714
Well, let's get to
my dad's boat, then.

06:19.738 --> 06:21.518
I'll show you exactly what happened.

06:23.034 --> 06:25.374
Well... hang on a tick.

06:25.434 --> 06:27.294
I, um... I locked the door behind me

06:27.354 --> 06:29.174
and then I got up,
out of the top hatch.

06:35.114 --> 06:37.054
OK, this door's unlocked now.

06:37.114 --> 06:38.574
Yes.

06:38.634 --> 06:40.814
He was trying to open it
from the other side.

06:40.874 --> 06:43.334
I saw it turning - the lock.

06:47.754 --> 06:49.694
Is that your father's phone?

06:51.034 --> 06:52.694
Yeah, it looks like it.

06:52.754 --> 06:55.254
I thought you said
Chester had your father's phone.

06:56.754 --> 06:59.214
Well, yeah, he did.
He texted me from it.

07:07.474 --> 07:09.254
I'm not making this up.

07:09.314 --> 07:10.894
I never said you were.

07:10.954 --> 07:12.854
Then do your job.

07:17.194 --> 07:19.934
Dust for fingerprints.
Call the Forensics team in.

07:19.994 --> 07:21.614
He was right here!

07:24.754 --> 07:26.614
Yes! Yes!

07:26.674 --> 07:29.494
Look, I told you
Chester had a syringe.

07:29.554 --> 07:31.734
But only one syringe, is that right?

07:31.794 --> 07:33.374
Yes.

07:36.274 --> 07:37.934
Then whose are those?

07:39.274 --> 07:40.854
Well, they...

07:40.914 --> 07:42.654
Chester must have left them there.

07:44.074 --> 07:45.574
They're not Dad's.

07:45.634 --> 07:47.734
Fern, I know how much
you care for your dad,

07:47.794 --> 07:50.454
but if you're making this up,
it won't help him.

07:50.514 --> 07:53.294
Chester was here
and he tried to kill me.

07:53.354 --> 07:56.014
Well... Fern...

07:56.074 --> 07:57.074
Fern?

08:05.914 --> 08:08.014
What happened? What did he say?

08:09.074 --> 08:10.894
He thinks Dad's on drugs.

08:10.954 --> 08:12.254
What?!

08:14.154 --> 08:15.374
Hello?

08:15.434 --> 08:17.534
Is this Fern Harrow? Yeah...

08:17.594 --> 08:20.174
Who's this.
This is St Catherine's Hospital.

08:20.234 --> 08:23.174
We have you listed as the emergency
contact for Callan Prowd.

08:23.234 --> 08:24.974
There's been an accident.

08:29.794 --> 08:31.934
I thought you were suspended.
I am.

08:33.474 --> 08:35.054
That's not his usual look, right?

08:35.114 --> 08:36.693
I've seen worse.

08:40.193 --> 08:42.294
I need your help.

08:44.954 --> 08:46.814
Francis Chester?

08:50.874 --> 08:52.414
I thought he was...

08:52.474 --> 08:54.734
Dead. No.

08:55.954 --> 08:58.054
He tried to kill Fern too.

08:59.874 --> 09:01.494
She OK?

09:01.554 --> 09:03.574
Well, she's a little shaken, but...

09:03.634 --> 09:05.254
she seemed alright.

09:05.314 --> 09:06.854
She's with the police.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.534
And you?

09:09.514 --> 09:11.774
I'm lucky to be alive.

09:11.834 --> 09:16.254
But digging me back up
wasn't part of his plan.

09:16.314 --> 09:19.214
I just hope whatever he injected me
with is still in my system.

09:19.274 --> 09:21.374
So, what are we looking for?

09:21.434 --> 09:23.414
Any type of fast-acting sedative -

09:23.474 --> 09:25.894
midazolam, ketamine, chloral hydrate.

09:25.954 --> 09:28.454
He knocked me out quickly
to get me inside that coffin.

09:28.514 --> 09:30.734
And you've told the police?

09:30.794 --> 09:32.214
Nichols.

09:32.274 --> 09:33.894
Don't think he believes me.

09:35.754 --> 09:37.494
That's it. All done.

09:38.754 --> 09:41.174
Thank you.

09:41.234 --> 09:43.294
Daniel...
I take it Bryan called you.

09:43.354 --> 09:46.014
I needed to check
inside that coffin, Max.

09:46.074 --> 09:47.774
Yes, and you were wrong.
But, Daniel...

09:47.834 --> 09:49.294
I was wrong about it being empty.

09:49.354 --> 09:51.454
Daniel...
That corpse isn't Chester's.

09:51.514 --> 09:53.374
I've had a call from Roma Street.

09:53.434 --> 09:55.094
There's been an accident.

09:55.154 --> 09:58.254
Callan's in hospital.
They're not sure if he'll survive.

09:59.354 --> 10:00.894
Go.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.014
You took his bloods?

10:05.074 --> 10:09.374
When the results come back,
I want to see them... immediately.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.534
He's still in surgery.

10:17.594 --> 10:18.854
Do they know how it happened?

10:18.914 --> 10:20.934
The delivery rider
said he came out of nowhere,

10:20.994 --> 10:22.374
just stepped onto the road.

10:22.434 --> 10:24.334
He smacked his head on the pavement.

10:24.394 --> 10:27.094
They did a scan, they say
there's a bleed to the brain.

10:28.554 --> 10:30.294
Dad, is he gonna be OK?

10:30.354 --> 10:31.694
I hope so.

10:35.634 --> 10:38.294
Nichols found drugs on the Bettie.

10:41.994 --> 10:43.774
Tell me what happened.

10:47.594 --> 10:49.854
There was a used syringe

10:49.914 --> 10:52.854
and... a whole stack of vials.

10:52.914 --> 10:54.694
He thinks you're using.

10:54.754 --> 10:56.694
Those are not my drugs.

10:56.754 --> 10:58.334
Chester must have put them there.

10:58.394 --> 11:00.494
Yeah, that... that's what I told him.

11:02.074 --> 11:04.014
But you can't prove it.

11:05.994 --> 11:08.534
You... you can't prove any of it.

11:08.594 --> 11:10.254
I'm trying.

11:10.314 --> 11:13.814
We just need to stay safe
until they I.D. that body.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.974
Then they'll know that everything
we've told them is true.

11:18.874 --> 11:20.094
OK?

11:32.034 --> 11:33.574
So, where's the body now?

11:33.634 --> 11:35.454
It's still in situ, at the cemetery.

11:35.514 --> 11:37.054
We've cordoned off the area

11:37.114 --> 11:39.094
to make sure no-one interferes
with the corpse.

11:39.154 --> 11:41.294
A little late for that, isn't it?

11:41.354 --> 11:43.854
Yeah. Has he been charged?

11:43.914 --> 11:45.314
He claims he didn't touch the body,

11:45.354 --> 11:47.834
so I can't charge him with anything
more serious than vandalism

11:47.894 --> 11:49.394
until we establish whether he did.

11:49.454 --> 11:52.894
But either way, Harrow is adamant
it's not Chester's body.

11:53.834 --> 11:56.134
Is there any reason to think
he may be right?

11:56.194 --> 11:58.374
No! No. No valid reason.

11:58.434 --> 12:01.974
And, yet, Dr Harrow forged
your signature

12:02.034 --> 12:04.494
and dug up one of the state's
most notorious killers

12:04.554 --> 12:06.734
because he thinks we buried
the wrong body.

12:06.794 --> 12:10.414
Can you imagine the fallout
if the media gets wind of this?

12:10.474 --> 12:12.094
If we can't even bury
the right person,

12:12.154 --> 12:13.734
what else might we be getting wrong?

12:13.794 --> 12:15.134
We didn't get it wrong.

12:16.114 --> 12:17.574
We didn't.

12:17.634 --> 12:20.054
Laurie Badcoe checked that body

12:20.114 --> 12:22.334
against the prison dental records.

12:22.394 --> 12:23.854
It's him.

12:24.914 --> 12:28.174
Well, it's technically
a crime scene.

12:28.234 --> 12:30.254
How do you want to handle it, Bryan?

12:30.314 --> 12:32.934
Well, I think
we should I.D. the remains -

12:32.994 --> 12:35.094
to put this whole thing to rest
once and for all.

12:35.154 --> 12:38.454
Fine. Bring it in here. Get it done.

12:38.514 --> 12:39.974
But let's keep it quiet.

12:46.234 --> 12:48.014
And if Harrow's right...

12:49.154 --> 12:51.414
and it's not Chester's body
in that coffin?

12:51.474 --> 12:53.654
Then we'll all have
things to answer for.

13:02.874 --> 13:05.894
Your Dr Harrow
came to ask my permission

13:05.954 --> 13:07.974
to exhume Francis's body,

13:08.034 --> 13:10.654
and I said no.

13:10.714 --> 13:12.414
But he did it anyway?

13:13.394 --> 13:15.894
I'm afraid so.

13:15.954 --> 13:20.014
The... remains will be
transported to the morgue,

13:20.074 --> 13:22.614
where we'll be performing
another post-mortem.

13:22.674 --> 13:23.774
Why?

13:24.754 --> 13:27.294
We know that Francis died
in that fire.

13:27.354 --> 13:30.414
Can't you just
fill his grave back in?

13:31.474 --> 13:32.974
Well, there are some questions

13:33.034 --> 13:35.094
regarding the identity
of the remains.

13:36.194 --> 13:37.854
What are you saying?

13:37.914 --> 13:40.814
That there's been a mistake?
That I buried the wrong body?

13:40.874 --> 13:42.374
Well, that's what we're looking into

13:42.434 --> 13:45.814
and we feel it's best for everyone
if we confirm it once and for all.

13:45.874 --> 13:48.854
Best for who? For me?

13:48.914 --> 13:51.694
I understand how distressing
this must be, Mrs Chester...

13:51.754 --> 13:54.614
No. You don't understand.

13:54.674 --> 13:59.174
My husband and I went through hell
when Francis was on trial.

13:59.234 --> 14:03.654
We lost our jobs. We lost
our privacy. We lost our friends.

14:03.714 --> 14:07.374
And all because the papers
needed someone to blame.

14:07.434 --> 14:09.094
What if they find out about this?

14:09.154 --> 14:11.414
We will do everything we can
to keep this quiet.

14:11.474 --> 14:13.574
No, what they put us through...

14:14.754 --> 14:18.414
they killed my husband
and they nearly destroyed me

14:18.474 --> 14:20.934
and I cannot go through that again.

14:23.234 --> 14:25.094
I'm sorry
but it's already under way.

14:28.234 --> 14:30.774
This was your decision, wasn't it?

14:30.834 --> 14:33.054
Well, if that is my son,

14:33.114 --> 14:35.134
and you have dug him up for nothing,

14:35.194 --> 14:36.974
then I'll be the one
going to the media,

14:37.034 --> 14:39.774
and this time, you'll all pay.

14:45.754 --> 14:49.774
The impact resulted in
a subdural haematoma.

14:49.834 --> 14:53.014
So, we've managed to stop
the bleeding, which wasn't easy,

14:53.074 --> 14:56.014
and we're keeping him
in an induced coma.

14:56.074 --> 14:57.894
Is he gonna be alright?

14:57.954 --> 15:00.614
The next 48 hours will be critical.

15:00.674 --> 15:03.334
Could I... could I see him?

15:04.754 --> 15:06.334
Of course.

15:22.754 --> 15:24.734
What happened to you, baby?

15:25.754 --> 15:28.774
You should go back to our hotel
and get some sleep.

15:28.834 --> 15:30.934
I hate hotels.

15:32.594 --> 15:34.694
I don't want to leave Fern.

15:34.754 --> 15:36.894
I'll be here.

15:37.954 --> 15:41.174
He's not gonna try anything
with all these people around.

15:42.754 --> 15:44.094
Go.

15:47.594 --> 15:49.774
Call if you need me.

16:02.634 --> 16:06.734
Max, do you think Harrow
could be self-medicating?

16:06.794 --> 16:09.414
I found drugs on his boat.

16:09.474 --> 16:11.854
Injectable ampoules
and a used syringe.

16:11.914 --> 16:14.094
I've asked Scientific
to check it out.

16:15.754 --> 16:17.774
I don't know.

16:17.834 --> 16:19.694
Let's just get this done.

16:24.594 --> 16:27.534
Well, this coffin is in worse shape
than the last one.

16:27.594 --> 16:29.214
You say Harrow did this?

16:29.274 --> 16:33.854
Yep. He claims he was sedated,
put inside and buried alive.

16:33.914 --> 16:37.894
How did he get inside the coffin if
there was already a body in there?

16:37.954 --> 16:39.454
I don't know, Lyle,

16:39.514 --> 16:41.834
but if Harrow touched this corpse,
I want to know about it.

16:41.858 --> 16:45.094
Right, I'm sure you're all aware
of the sensitive nature of this,

16:45.154 --> 16:49.414
regarding Dr Harrow and the illegal
exhumation of the deceased.

16:49.474 --> 16:52.134
Bearing that in mind,
I'd like this taken care of

16:52.194 --> 16:55.094
as quickly and quietly as possible.

16:55.154 --> 16:58.494
The sooner we can confirm that
this is, in fact, Francis Chester,

16:58.554 --> 17:00.494
the sooner we can put it
all behind us.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.774
Unless Harrow is right.

17:06.194 --> 17:08.094
Alright, let's remove the body

17:08.154 --> 17:10.174
and get it measured and scanned.

17:11.154 --> 17:13.493
Gloves and masks, please.

17:17.394 --> 17:19.614
 When it rained five days

17:19.674 --> 17:23.214
 And the skies turned dark
as night...

17:26.914 --> 17:31.694
 Then trouble's taken place
in the lowlands

17:31.754 --> 17:33.894
 At night

17:36.034 --> 17:39.014
 I woke up this mornin'

17:39.074 --> 17:42.254
 Can't even get out of my door

17:45.314 --> 17:47.694
 I woke up this mornin'

17:47.754 --> 17:51.974
 Can't even get out of my door

17:55.034 --> 17:57.094
 There's enough trouble

17:57.154 --> 18:00.894
 To make a poor girl wonder
where she want to go

18:03.874 --> 18:08.414
 Then they rowed a little boat
about five miles...

18:11.554 --> 18:13.534
How about I get us a coffee?

19:09.074 --> 19:11.014
Multiple murderer?

19:11.074 --> 19:12.614
Yes.

19:12.674 --> 19:14.854
You know, I remember the case well.

19:14.914 --> 19:17.654
Francis Chester was an anaesthetist

19:17.714 --> 19:19.734
who'd immobilise his victims,

19:19.794 --> 19:23.374
then strangle the females
while their boyfriends watched.

19:23.434 --> 19:25.294
Doctors...

19:26.554 --> 19:28.734
And Harrow found the evidence
to convict him?

19:28.794 --> 19:30.214
Harrow and Pavich.

19:30.274 --> 19:32.894
Maxine was on the case? Yes.

19:32.954 --> 19:36.614
She was just as determined to put
Chester behind bars as Harrow.

19:36.674 --> 19:38.734
Quite right too.

19:38.794 --> 19:41.094
This man was a monster.

19:42.154 --> 19:44.854
- But it almost didn't happen.
- Why's that?

19:44.914 --> 19:47.334
Well, the key piece of evidence
in the prosecution's case

19:47.394 --> 19:50.334
were the tiny traces of succinic acid

19:50.394 --> 19:53.134
that Harrow found
in Chester's male victims.

19:53.194 --> 19:55.374
He claimed that it proved

19:55.434 --> 19:58.734
that Chester injected them
with succinylcholine.

19:58.794 --> 20:03.374
But the defence argued that succinic
acid naturally occurs in the body

20:03.434 --> 20:05.334
and, so, the evidence was dismissed.

20:05.394 --> 20:07.134
So, Chester almost got off?

20:07.194 --> 20:09.934
Almost. Until Harrow burned
the midnight oil,

20:09.994 --> 20:11.774
conducted new tests

20:11.834 --> 20:15.534
and found tiny traces of propofol
in the female victims.

20:15.594 --> 20:18.734
Propofol. That's a sedative,
isn't it?

20:18.794 --> 20:21.614
Fast-acting, very powerful.

20:21.674 --> 20:25.654
But unlike succinic acid,
it is not naturally occurring.

20:26.754 --> 20:28.454
Where did Harrow find it?

20:28.514 --> 20:31.254
In the liver tissue
of the female victims.

20:31.314 --> 20:33.334
It was the final day of the trial.

20:33.394 --> 20:35.614
Everyone thought
that Chester was going to walk.

20:35.674 --> 20:38.534
The propofol Harrow found
is what convicted him.

20:38.594 --> 20:43.494
It was really a very clever find
on Harrow's part.

20:43.554 --> 20:46.134
Quite brilliant, really.

20:46.194 --> 20:49.414
Makes you wonder
how things... came to this.

20:59.754 --> 21:01.494
You OK, sweetheart?

21:04.994 --> 21:06.574
No.

21:13.754 --> 21:18.574
How... how badly did the shooting
affect him, do you think?

21:19.474 --> 21:22.214
Well, some blokes get shot and
they're back at work in a fortnight.

21:26.754 --> 21:29.774
Some get shot
and they're ruined for life.

21:30.794 --> 21:32.534
That's what I'm afraid of.

21:45.594 --> 21:47.854
Rhonda?

21:47.914 --> 21:49.894
I need to talk to you. Rhonnie?

22:26.354 --> 22:28.254
That's our scan

22:28.314 --> 22:30.334
and this is the one
Laurie Badcoe did

22:30.394 --> 22:33.014
immediately after the prison fire
six months ago.

22:33.074 --> 22:34.394
What are we looking for, exactly?

22:34.454 --> 22:36.254
Well, anything to indicate
it's the same body.

22:36.294 --> 22:38.374
Height's a match.

22:38.434 --> 22:39.854
Rib count?

22:39.914 --> 22:41.454
12 in both.

22:41.514 --> 22:43.214
It says here that the deceased

22:43.274 --> 22:45.934
fractured his collarbone
in a skateboarding accident

22:45.994 --> 22:47.574
when he was eight years old.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.174
Check the right clavicle.

22:50.594 --> 22:52.214
There. I see it.

22:52.274 --> 22:53.494
That's it.

22:53.554 --> 22:56.934
Present in both scans. The CTs match.

22:58.994 --> 23:02.334
You know, a lot of kids
fracture their collarbones.

23:02.394 --> 23:05.014
Let's cross-check with the prison
dental records as well.

23:07.394 --> 23:09.454
One-six removed.

23:09.514 --> 23:11.494
Check.

23:11.554 --> 23:13.894
One-five restored.

23:13.954 --> 23:15.454
There's two amalgam fillings.

23:15.514 --> 23:18.054
Occlusal and buccal. Check.

23:19.034 --> 23:20.534
One-four, ceramic crown.

23:20.594 --> 23:21.774
Check.

23:25.034 --> 23:26.534
Grace?

23:27.754 --> 23:29.094
Is that all of them?

23:29.154 --> 23:30.694
Yes.

23:30.754 --> 23:32.894
Dental is a match as well.

23:32.954 --> 23:34.654
Then it's conclusive.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.694
This is the body of Francis Chester.

23:37.754 --> 23:39.574
So, Dr Harrow got it wrong.

23:39.634 --> 23:41.534
So it seems.

24:29.154 --> 24:31.094
So, is it confirmed?

24:31.154 --> 24:34.134
The body Harrow dug up
is Francis Chester?

24:34.194 --> 24:37.654
It matched Badcoe's PM
and the prison dental records.

24:42.074 --> 24:43.654
What will happen to Daniel?

24:44.994 --> 24:47.774
I really don't think
there's any coming back from this.

24:53.314 --> 24:56.974
I don't get it, Maxine.
Harrow loves his job.

24:57.034 --> 24:59.414
Why would he lie to you...

25:00.434 --> 25:02.814
lie to the Deputy Coroner,

25:02.874 --> 25:06.334
risk criminal charges and his career
to dig this guy up?

25:06.394 --> 25:08.654
Could we be looking at
the wrong body?

25:08.714 --> 25:10.174
Could there have been a mistake?

25:12.274 --> 25:15.774
You really think
that Laurie Badcoe got it wrong?

25:15.834 --> 25:18.854
That the prison got it wrong?

25:18.914 --> 25:20.574
No.

25:20.634 --> 25:23.814
Harrow's mistake
was forging my signature

25:23.874 --> 25:26.934
and digging up a man
no-one wants to remember.

25:26.994 --> 25:28.694
But he seems so convinced.

25:28.754 --> 25:33.054
Grace, Bryan thinks that Harrow
is suffering from PTSD.

25:34.754 --> 25:38.374
OK, so, you said he hasn't been
the same since he was shot.

25:38.434 --> 25:41.014
Seeing Harrow throw away
his career like this,

25:41.074 --> 25:42.854
I mean, that is not easy
for any of us.

25:42.914 --> 25:47.654
Listen, I suggest that we just learn
from this and do our jobs.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.614
Daniel?

27:44.674 --> 27:46.534
Are you in there?

27:53.754 --> 27:55.374
Sorry.

27:58.834 --> 28:02.374
Are you OK?
Yeah. Yeah. Come on in.

28:13.754 --> 28:16.974
Are my results back?
From my blood test?

28:18.114 --> 28:19.694
Not yet.

28:21.394 --> 28:23.734
We've I.D.'d the corpse you dug up.

28:23.794 --> 28:25.694
We compared
the prison dental records

28:25.754 --> 28:28.374
with Badcoe's post-mortem C.T.

28:28.434 --> 28:30.094
It's a match.

28:31.834 --> 28:35.174
It's a match with a body
that's not Francis Chester's.

28:36.474 --> 28:38.374
Those records have been altered.

28:38.434 --> 28:39.854
That's impossible.

28:39.914 --> 28:45.134
And, yet, a dead man buried me alive
and tried to kill my daughter.

28:53.834 --> 28:55.174
Sorry.

28:58.834 --> 29:01.334
Do you know how I felt...

29:01.394 --> 29:03.574
when I was locked inside
that coffin?

29:05.234 --> 29:07.414
In the moments before I blacked out?

29:09.634 --> 29:11.534
I thought I'd be scared.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.654
But I wasn't.

29:15.594 --> 29:17.334
At least not for myself.

29:17.394 --> 29:19.174
But I was terrified for Fern.

29:20.594 --> 29:22.614
What he was going to do to her.

29:25.274 --> 29:26.814
And in that moment...

29:27.794 --> 29:29.814
all I wanted to do

29:29.874 --> 29:32.334
was put my hands around his throat

29:32.394 --> 29:34.934
and do to him
what he wanted to do to Fern.

29:36.314 --> 29:39.814
What he did to all those
innocent people he murdered.

29:41.074 --> 29:42.694
Simon...

29:44.754 --> 29:49.134
I wanted to squeeze the last breath
from his body.

29:50.994 --> 29:52.774
And watch him die.

29:58.874 --> 30:00.694
Chester is alive.

30:02.274 --> 30:04.454
And I will end this.

30:07.154 --> 30:09.214
But you're still not sure.

30:09.274 --> 30:11.854
No, I'm not doubting
that something happened to you...

30:11.914 --> 30:13.214
But you are!

30:17.634 --> 30:19.894
It's really quite simple.

30:20.914 --> 30:22.894
Either I've lost my mind

30:22.954 --> 30:25.294
and put everything I care about
in jeopardy

30:25.354 --> 30:27.294
because of some insane delusion...

30:30.554 --> 30:32.254
or I'm right.

31:07.874 --> 31:09.574
Badcoe.

31:09.634 --> 31:11.614
It's Harrow.

31:11.674 --> 31:13.454
You need to get yourself down here.

31:14.514 --> 31:16.054
Now.

31:17.074 --> 31:18.854
Sarge?

31:18.914 --> 31:22.254
Forensics have taken a look
at Harrow's phone.

31:23.194 --> 31:25.134
Only one set of prints was found.

31:25.194 --> 31:26.454
Harrow's?

31:29.114 --> 31:31.334
What about those ampoules
that were found on his boat?

31:31.394 --> 31:33.334
Do we know what's inside?
Hopefully tomorrow.

31:33.394 --> 31:35.014
Same with the syringe.

31:35.074 --> 31:37.094
OK. Thanks, Joan.

31:53.394 --> 31:55.774
Nichols. Bryan, it's Grace.

31:55.834 --> 31:57.894
Have you identified the body?

31:57.954 --> 31:59.454
Apparently.

31:59.514 --> 32:01.094
And?

32:01.154 --> 32:05.134
And the records all matched.
They say it's Francis Chester.

32:07.954 --> 32:09.734
What do YOU think?

32:11.114 --> 32:13.094
I still have questions.

32:13.154 --> 32:15.094
Is there...

32:16.314 --> 32:18.494
anything else you can do

32:18.554 --> 32:20.694
to prove that it might not
be Chester?

32:23.754 --> 32:26.254
Maybe, but it's a long shot.

32:26.314 --> 32:28.054
We can compare the DNA

32:28.114 --> 32:31.254
with Chester's original arrest swab
from 15 years ago,

32:31.314 --> 32:32.734
but it'll take time.

32:32.794 --> 32:34.174
Do it.

32:59.874 --> 33:03.014
- Hello?
- Fern, it's me. How's Callan?

33:03.074 --> 33:04.814
Well, he's still not awake.

33:04.874 --> 33:07.374
Where are you?

33:07.434 --> 33:09.254
I'm... at the hospital.

33:10.274 --> 33:11.654
Doesn't sound like it.

33:11.714 --> 33:13.574
I'm just getting Mum a coffee.

33:13.634 --> 33:15.014
Where are you?

33:15.074 --> 33:17.454
Hotel.

33:17.514 --> 33:19.494
Doesn't sound like it.

33:20.634 --> 33:23.774
Just... don't stray too far, OK?

33:24.874 --> 33:26.734
Yeah, well, you be careful too.

33:26.794 --> 33:28.174
Fern?

33:29.554 --> 33:32.014
I love you. Love you too.

33:42.914 --> 33:44.574
Hello?

33:47.994 --> 33:49.854
Is anyone here?

34:03.034 --> 34:04.414
Who are you?

34:04.474 --> 34:07.414
I'm Fern Harrow.
Callan's girlfriend.

34:07.474 --> 34:09.414
I'm Callan's boss. How's he doing?

34:09.474 --> 34:10.893
We haven't heard anything.

34:10.954 --> 34:12.534
That's actually why I'm here.

34:12.594 --> 34:14.333
Um, I was wondering
if there was anyone

34:14.393 --> 34:15.893
I could talk to about the accident.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.574
Right.
Anyone who saw him get hit.

34:18.994 --> 34:21.454
Well, I wasn't here last night.

34:21.514 --> 34:24.254
OK, well, who was?
Our other kitchenhand.

34:24.313 --> 34:27.333
Frank.
Great. Can I get Frank's number?

34:27.393 --> 34:29.734
We don't give out employee numbers.

34:29.793 --> 34:34.094
Please. I... I just want to know
what Callan was doing out there.

34:34.154 --> 34:36.054
Was he going somewhere?
Did Frank see him leave?

34:36.114 --> 34:38.373
We really like Callan. We do.

34:38.434 --> 34:40.813
But what happened to him,
it's not our fault.

34:40.873 --> 34:43.934
I didn't say it was.
Now, I think you should just leave.

34:46.154 --> 34:48.813
OK, well, I'll give him
your regards.

34:51.914 --> 34:53.614
Arsehole.

35:27.274 --> 35:29.654
A body came into the morgue

35:29.714 --> 35:31.294
six months ago.

35:31.354 --> 35:32.814
John Doe - it was...

35:33.794 --> 35:36.414
a homeless guy, died in a fire.

35:36.474 --> 35:41.094
As far as I knew, that body was sent
to the crematorium.

35:41.154 --> 35:42.614
But after you called...

35:43.754 --> 35:46.614
I found a document signed by me

35:46.674 --> 35:48.814
saying that the transfer
had been cancelled.

35:48.874 --> 35:51.814
I don't remember
signing that document,

35:51.874 --> 35:55.014
but on that very same day,
there was a prison fire.

35:55.074 --> 35:57.734
The fire that killed Chester.

35:59.994 --> 36:02.734
So, who was transporting the bodies?

36:02.794 --> 36:04.734
Rhonda did most of the runs.

36:04.794 --> 36:09.414
So, she somehow
brought that body into the prison

36:09.474 --> 36:11.454
and left with Chester in the van.

36:14.114 --> 36:15.974
You have to tell the police.

36:16.034 --> 36:17.974
They can talk with Rhonda.

36:18.034 --> 36:20.094
Rhonda's gone, Dan.

36:20.154 --> 36:22.894
Packed up, shot through.
I don't know where she's gone.

36:22.954 --> 36:26.774
There must be some other evidence -
paper trail, something.

36:26.834 --> 36:28.614
She knew about my drinking.

36:28.674 --> 36:30.534
I relied on her.

36:30.594 --> 36:33.934
I signed everything
she put in front of.

36:33.994 --> 36:37.334
She had my login I.D.
She had access to the archives.

36:37.394 --> 36:39.854
There's nothing to prove
any of this.

36:42.794 --> 36:46.374
But you have to tell the police
what you know.

36:46.434 --> 36:48.854
They'll have no choice
but to look into it.

36:50.994 --> 36:57.054
And if I... admit this, every single
one of my cases will be questioned.

36:57.114 --> 36:59.174
Evidence will be re-examined.

36:59.234 --> 37:02.494
Convictions will be overturned

37:02.554 --> 37:04.854
and the victims and families

37:04.914 --> 37:06.774
will have to go through
that pain again.

37:06.834 --> 37:08.814
And your career will be ruined

37:08.874 --> 37:13.414
and you'd lose your reputation,
your job, your pension.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.774
My daughter was attacked.

37:22.074 --> 37:24.294
Chester wants to hurt my family

37:24.354 --> 37:26.814
and all you want to do
is protect yourself?

37:29.274 --> 37:31.014
You're a coward.

37:35.154 --> 37:37.974
Even if I did tell the cops,

37:38.034 --> 37:40.814
all they'd have
is the word of a drunk.

37:43.794 --> 37:45.614
Get off my boat.

38:26.754 --> 38:29.294
I thought you weren't
rostered on today.

38:29.354 --> 38:30.894
I'm not.

38:34.754 --> 38:36.534
But I could use a hand.

38:49.114 --> 38:53.174
Now I have the chance
to do more than kill you once.

38:54.754 --> 38:58.534
Now I will take away
everything that you hold dear.

39:00.154 --> 39:01.814
Everything you love.

39:03.594 --> 39:07.414
Everything that makes your life
worth living.

39:11.434 --> 39:15.534
So, is it true, what everybody's
saying about Dr Harrow?

39:15.594 --> 39:17.574
What is everyone saying?

39:17.634 --> 39:19.214
That he's lost it.

39:20.314 --> 39:21.974
What do you think?

39:22.914 --> 39:25.294
Well, I hardly know the guy

39:25.354 --> 39:29.134
but it seems to me he's always
been a bit on the loopy side.

39:30.314 --> 39:32.614
But I kind of like that about him.

39:33.554 --> 39:34.934
Me too.

39:38.754 --> 39:41.014
Dr Molyneux, what are you doing?

39:42.274 --> 39:44.494
I'm collecting
another tissue sample.

39:46.194 --> 39:47.734
What for?

39:47.794 --> 39:50.374
To run a check against
the national DNA database.

39:50.434 --> 39:53.574
No-one's done that yet.
Because no-one needed to.

39:53.634 --> 39:57.294
The prison dental records matched.
Badcoe's CT scan matched.

39:57.354 --> 40:01.454
What if Badcoe got it wrong?
I can't see how that's possible.

40:02.954 --> 40:07.134
No DNA sample was taken from
Chester's body after the prison fire.

40:07.194 --> 40:09.814
The only DNA sample there is on file

40:09.874 --> 40:13.254
is the one taken from Chester
when he was arrested 15 years ago.

40:14.154 --> 40:17.414
So, I want to compare this new sample
to that arrest swab

40:17.474 --> 40:19.414
on the national database.

40:20.354 --> 40:22.974
I need to be sure. About Harrow?

40:29.914 --> 40:32.374
Alright, Dr Molyneux...

40:32.434 --> 40:34.654
Let's give it a shot.
I'll scrub up.

40:48.634 --> 40:50.214
Steph?

40:50.274 --> 40:51.814
Steph?

40:54.594 --> 40:56.894
Sorry. Where's Fern?

40:56.954 --> 40:59.494
I don't know. She was just here.

40:59.554 --> 41:01.174
I'll call her.

41:07.914 --> 41:09.894
She's at the hotel.

41:10.994 --> 41:13.534
She shouldn't have left on her own.

41:14.634 --> 41:16.534
It's OK. I'll go.

41:16.594 --> 41:18.334
You stay here, with Callan.

41:20.474 --> 41:21.934
I'm sorry.

41:25.314 --> 41:27.694
I should have told you everything
from the start.

41:27.754 --> 41:31.014
Yes. But we always
seem to end up here.

42:17.434 --> 42:18.774
Karl.

42:21.154 --> 42:23.574
Dr Molyneux?

42:23.634 --> 42:25.334
These just came for you.

42:39.914 --> 42:41.934
Harrow's blood test results?

42:43.354 --> 42:47.014
They found high levels of propofol
in his system.

42:47.074 --> 42:48.774
Maxine...

42:48.834 --> 42:51.774
It's a sedative.
The same one Francis Chester used...

42:51.834 --> 42:53.974
Yes, I know what propofol is.

42:59.274 --> 43:01.374
Thank you, Dr Molyneux.

43:25.754 --> 43:27.614
How's he doing?

43:28.754 --> 43:30.574
Not great.

43:30.634 --> 43:32.014
And you?

43:33.754 --> 43:35.374
I've had better days.

43:36.994 --> 43:39.494
Your... your bloods came back.

43:40.754 --> 43:43.334
What did Grace find? Propofol.

43:44.234 --> 43:47.734
Chester used propofol
to sedate his female victims.

43:54.754 --> 43:56.574
Are you self-medicating?

43:57.634 --> 43:58.814
No.

43:58.874 --> 44:01.054
You know propofol
is highly addictive.

44:01.114 --> 44:02.654
Yes, but I'm not using.

44:02.714 --> 44:04.574
Bryan found drugs on your boat.

44:04.634 --> 44:06.134
Syringes, ampoules.

44:06.194 --> 44:08.294
They're not mine.
Chester put them there.

44:08.354 --> 44:10.894
Chester's dead.
Grace positively I.D.'d his remains.

44:10.954 --> 44:12.734
He's alive.

44:20.074 --> 44:21.814
What?

44:23.834 --> 44:25.614
This is my fault.

44:29.034 --> 44:32.574
I let you go back to work
too early after the shootings. I...

44:32.634 --> 44:36.094
I thought getting back on the job
would help.

44:36.154 --> 44:40.494
Maxine, I don't have anxiety
or psychosis,

44:40.554 --> 44:42.334
and I'm not abusing drugs.

44:42.394 --> 44:44.294
Then why won't you let this go?

44:44.354 --> 44:45.694
Because it's the truth.

44:45.754 --> 44:47.954
And once upon a time, Daniel,
I would have believed you.

44:47.978 --> 44:50.038
But not this time.
You have gone too far!

44:51.034 --> 44:52.614
I'm scared.

44:52.674 --> 44:54.454
You know, I'm... I'm scared.

44:54.514 --> 44:57.534
I'm scared for Fern,
for you, for all of us.

44:57.594 --> 45:01.494
You are too good a pathologist
to throw away a career like this.

45:04.114 --> 45:06.894
You're too good a friend to lose.

45:09.554 --> 45:11.254
You're breaking my heart.

45:14.514 --> 45:18.254
Listen. I... I can get you
whatever help you need.

45:19.274 --> 45:23.054
OK? But please, please,
tell me the truth.

45:27.194 --> 45:28.734
I am.

45:44.634 --> 45:46.694
The, um...

45:48.074 --> 45:51.974
The Deputy Coroner is holding
an emergency tribunal tomorrow

45:52.034 --> 45:53.414
to decide your future.

45:53.474 --> 45:55.174
He's expecting you to be there.

45:56.754 --> 46:00.814
As your boss, I advise you
to turn up and tell them the truth.

46:02.114 --> 46:04.894
Or the career that you love
will be over.

46:09.914 --> 46:12.214
Everything I hold dear.

46:29.474 --> 46:31.334
Listen, you really shouldn't be here.
OK.

46:31.394 --> 46:32.794
I've just got to ask you something.

46:32.854 --> 46:34.854
Whatever it is,
you need to go through a solicitor.

46:34.878 --> 46:37.654
Just one thing. Do you recognise
the guy in this photo?

46:37.714 --> 46:39.574
Do you?

46:40.594 --> 46:43.174
That's Frank. Our kitchenhand.

46:47.834 --> 46:49.574
You've reached Daniel Harrow.

46:49.634 --> 46:52.654
Leave a message and I'll
return your call... at some point.

46:52.714 --> 46:54.414
Dad, it's me.

46:54.474 --> 46:58.174
I'm on the way to the hospital.
I need to talk to you.

46:58.234 --> 47:00.814
Can you give me a call
the second you get this?

47:34.474 --> 47:36.454
There has been an emergency

47:36.514 --> 47:38.414
reported in the building.

47:38.474 --> 47:40.054
Leave the building immediately

47:40.114 --> 47:42.974
using marked stairways and exits.

47:43.034 --> 47:45.294
Do not use elevators.

47:52.794 --> 47:54.694
There has been an emergency

47:54.754 --> 47:56.214
reported in the building.

47:56.274 --> 48:01.294
Leave the building immediately
using marked stairways and exits.

48:01.354 --> 48:03.254
Do not use elevators.

48:23.754 --> 48:26.134
What have you given him?
Succinylcholine.

48:29.234 --> 48:31.574
It's a damn shame.
He would have made a great chef.

48:31.634 --> 48:33.854
Bye, Daniel.

48:35.434 --> 48:37.334
I'm not letting you leave.

48:38.514 --> 48:40.974
Well, then, you have
a choice to make.

48:41.914 --> 48:44.214
You can either try and stop me

48:44.274 --> 48:46.374
or you can try and save the boy.

48:48.874 --> 48:52.734
Did I mention
it was a very strong dose?

49:02.754 --> 49:05.654
Come on, Callan! Come on!

49:08.354 --> 49:10.374
Check out the lobby.

49:10.434 --> 49:12.754
You guys head up into the lobby,
we'll break out the hoses,

49:12.778 --> 49:14.538
get around the back
and we'll get it all set.

49:15.954 --> 49:18.214
There has been an emergency...

49:18.274 --> 49:20.294
You check the boards
in the lobby.

49:20.354 --> 49:22.094
Leave the building immediately

49:22.154 --> 49:23.934
using marked stairways and exits.

49:24.914 --> 49:27.134
- Do not use elevators.
- Come on, let's go!

50:11.754 --> 50:14.254
Please... don't let him do this.

50:57.074 --> 50:59.294
It's good to see you again.

51:05.754 --> 51:07.374
Next on Harrow...

51:07.434 --> 51:10.054
She's in danger.
Bryan, please, you've got to help!

51:10.114 --> 51:11.914
You don't seriously think
I'm making this up?!

51:11.938 --> 51:13.494
He's gone off the rails.

51:13.554 --> 51:15.174
He is to be detained onsite

51:15.234 --> 51:17.574
and transferred to the
mental health unit at South Side.

51:17.634 --> 51:19.774
So, you agree Dr Harrow
is a problem?

51:19.834 --> 51:22.054
- He's made his own bed.
- I don't think he did.

51:22.114 --> 51:23.374
I think Chester is alive.
