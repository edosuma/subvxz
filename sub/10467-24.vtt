00:27.070 --> 00:31.074
WELCOME TO PARTY OF FIVE:
A FAMILY ALBUM.

00:31.074 --> 00:33.033
I GOT THE SCRIPT,
LIKE ANY OTHER,

00:33.033 --> 00:36.558
SORT OF, AUDITION,
UM, AND READ IT

00:36.558 --> 00:38.995
AND HAD A REACTION TO
THIS PARTICULAR SCRIPT,

00:38.995 --> 00:41.128
LIKE, I'M SURE,
EVERYONE WHO READ IT,

00:41.128 --> 00:43.913
WHERE, UM,
I TURNED TO THE GIRL

00:43.913 --> 00:45.915
THAT I WAS WITH
AT THE TIME,

00:45.915 --> 00:48.613
I PUT IT DOWN,
AND I JUST SORT OF
HAD TEARS IN MY EYES,

00:48.613 --> 00:50.050
AND I SAID,
"I HAVE TO DO THIS."

00:50.050 --> 00:53.270
WE SAW HIM THE FIRST--
THE FIRST DAY--

00:53.270 --> 00:55.620
SEC--HE WAS, LIKE,
THE SECOND OR THIRD ACTOR,

00:55.620 --> 01:00.147
AND WE BOTH SAID, UM,
YEP...THAT'S IT.

01:00.147 --> 01:02.410
SHH.

01:02.410 --> 01:05.108
LISTEN. JUST TO KEEP YOU
UP TO DATE--

01:05.108 --> 01:07.763
AND DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY--

01:07.763 --> 01:11.375
BUT I'M GOING CRAZY HERE.

01:11.375 --> 01:15.379
SO UNLESS I COME UP WITH
SOME KIND OF NANNY SOON,

01:15.379 --> 01:17.860
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO SELL YOU OFF
TO WHITE-SLAVE TRADERS.

01:17.860 --> 01:22.082
NOW, I KNOW THAT'S NOT
HOW YOU PICTURED YOURSELF
GROWING UP,

01:22.082 --> 01:25.563
BUT, HEY...
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.

01:25.563 --> 01:28.218
THE NEXT 2 PEOPLE
WE CAST, UH, WERE,

01:28.218 --> 01:30.699
UH, LACEY--CLAUDIA--
AND MATTHEW, AS CHARLIE,

01:30.699 --> 01:33.310
AND WE CAST BOTH OF THEM
OFF A VIDEOTAPE
FROM NEW YORK,

01:33.310 --> 01:35.051
WHICH IS A TERRIBLE WAY
TO CAST PEOPLE.

01:35.051 --> 01:36.966
YOU'RE EATING
YOUR LUNCH, AND YOU'RE
FAST-FORWARDING

01:36.966 --> 01:39.011
THROUGH THE TAPES,
AND EVERYONE'S GOING,

01:39.011 --> 01:40.578
"THAT'S BAD." "OH,
THAT'S THE WRONG LOOK."
"THERE'S A BLONDE."

01:40.578 --> 01:42.754
Woman: SCENE 2.

01:42.754 --> 01:45.453
GUESS WHAT. I'M GONNA
BE A SCREAMING GIRL
IN THE CRUCIBLE.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.759
NO KIDDING, CLAUD.
A SCREAMING GIRL?

01:47.759 --> 01:49.283
SOUNDS LIKE
A GREAT PART.

01:49.283 --> 01:51.850
YEAH. WELL, I DON'T
ACTUALLY HAVE ANY LINES.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.678
I JUST SCREAM A LOT.

01:53.678 --> 01:55.767
WANNA SEE?

01:55.767 --> 01:57.421
AAH!

01:57.421 --> 01:59.989
STOP IT! STOP IT!

01:59.989 --> 02:01.730
GOD, YOU'RE GOOD...

02:01.730 --> 02:04.428
THERE WAS SO MUCH, SORT OF,
SUNSHINE IN HER FACE.

02:04.428 --> 02:06.082
AND SHE WAS SO--

02:06.082 --> 02:08.389
IT WASN'T EXACTLY
HOW SHE DID THE SCENES.

02:08.389 --> 02:10.347
IT WAS JUST
AN ESSENCE OF HER.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.697
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU PAWNED IT?

02:12.697 --> 02:14.873
I HAD NO CHOICE.

02:14.873 --> 02:17.659
LOOK, I MEAN, LESSONS
ARE REAL EXPENSIVE,

02:17.659 --> 02:19.356
AND WE'RE KIND OF
STRAPPED RIGHT NOW.

02:19.356 --> 02:22.185
OWEN HAS NO ONE
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.796
I GUESS I HAD TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN MY VIOLIN

02:24.796 --> 02:27.843
AND A NANNY
FOR MY BABY BROTHER.

02:27.843 --> 02:30.237
SORRY, ROSS.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.282
I'M SORRY.

02:32.282 --> 02:35.372
WE WERE HAVING
A VERY DIFFICULT TIME
WITH THE ROLE OF CHARLIE.

02:35.372 --> 02:38.027
I WAS HURTIN'.
I NEEDED A JOB.

02:38.027 --> 02:40.769
I WAS STUDYING
IN NEW YORK, UM,

02:40.769 --> 02:44.207
AND JUST DOING WHATEVER
I COULD DO TO GET BY.

02:44.207 --> 02:47.471
AND, UH, WENT INTO
AN AUDITION IN NEW YORK,

02:47.471 --> 02:49.386
WENT ON TAPE.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.388
I REMEMBER WITH MATTHEW,
WE WERE SITTING
AND LOOKING AT HIM,

02:51.388 --> 02:52.694
AND HE WAS
KIND OF GREEN--

02:52.694 --> 02:53.695
IT WAS
VERY BAD LIGHTING,
VERY BAD SOUND--

02:53.695 --> 02:55.175
AND SOMEBODY SAID...

02:55.175 --> 02:58.265
QUIET! WAIT A SECOND.
LOOK AT THIS GUY.

02:58.265 --> 03:02.747
AND WE ALL STOPPED AND LOOKED
AT MATT'S--MATTHEW'S TAPE.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.793
AND WE WENT, "OOHH..."

03:04.793 --> 03:06.882
10 SECONDS LATER,
WE WOULD HAVE GONE
THROUGH THAT TAPE,

03:06.882 --> 03:09.014
AND WE WOULD NEVER
HAVE SEEN MATTHEW.

03:09.014 --> 03:10.233
AND I THINK I WAS
THE ONE WHO SAID,

03:10.233 --> 03:11.974
"I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S
ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH."

03:11.974 --> 03:14.368
MATTHEW, ON THE BACK
OF HIS HEADSHOT--
WE JOKE ABOUT IT--

03:14.368 --> 03:17.414
IT SAID, "CAN OPERATE
FARM EQUIPMENT."

03:17.414 --> 03:18.981
I'D GROWN UP IN WYOMING
MY WHOLE LIFE.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.156
THAT'S THE GUY
WE GOT TO HAVE.

03:20.156 --> 03:22.202
THAT'S THE KIND
OF FLEXIBILITY YOU NEED.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.813
MOST LIKELY
TO APPEAR ON HEE HAW.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.510
WE FLEW HIM OUT...

03:26.510 --> 03:28.817
TO READ WITH SCOTT,
WHO'D ALREADY BEEN CAST.

03:28.817 --> 03:32.299
WELL, MATTHEW WAS
THE FIRST, UH...PERSON

03:32.299 --> 03:34.214
I REALLY TALKED TO
OF THE REST OF THE CAST,

03:34.214 --> 03:35.650
ACTUALLY,
AT HIS AUDITION.

03:35.650 --> 03:36.868
WE WERE WALKING
DOWN THE HALLWAY,

03:36.868 --> 03:39.697
AND IT WAS JUST ONE
OF THOSE AWKWARD MOMENTS

03:39.697 --> 03:41.917
WHEN 2 PEOPLE ARE JUST
GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

03:41.917 --> 03:45.007
AND I WAS TRYING TO FIND
SOME SORT OF COMMON GROUND
OR SOMETHING.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.878
AND I TURNED
TO HIM AND SAID...

03:46.878 --> 03:49.141
"IT'S FUNNY.
YOU KNOW, UH...

03:49.141 --> 03:50.969
WOLF, FOX."

03:50.969 --> 03:53.537
FOX, WOLF--YOU KNOW.

03:53.537 --> 03:55.583
I SAID..."YEAH."

03:55.583 --> 03:57.715
KIND OF STRANGE.

03:57.715 --> 04:00.240
THAT WAS KIND OF--

04:00.240 --> 04:02.633
THAT WAS OUR FIRST
HEART-TO-HEART.

04:02.633 --> 04:06.158
YOU LET EVERYONE THINK
YOU'RE THIS GREAT GUY...

04:06.158 --> 04:08.770
JUST TRYING TO HOLD
HIS FAMILY TOGETHER.

04:08.770 --> 04:11.947
YOU'RE JUST LIKE
A FATHER TO US.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.688
EVEN IF WE KNOW
IT'S A LIE.

04:16.081 --> 04:18.475
IN TRYING TO CAST JULIA,

04:18.475 --> 04:20.390
WE WERE LOOKING
FOR A 15-YEAR-OLD.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.913
AND WE COULDN'T
FIND ANYBODY.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.524
AND WE HAD GONE
THROUGH EVERYONE
IN LOS ANGELES

04:23.524 --> 04:25.352
AND A LOT OF OTHER
CITIES AS WELL.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.397
AND EVERY TIME
WE WENT TO THE NETWORK,

04:27.397 --> 04:30.922
THEY KEPT, UM, THEY KEPT
SENDING US BACK OUT

04:30.922 --> 04:33.185
AND SAYING,
"PLEASE FIND SOMEONE

04:33.185 --> 04:36.450
A LITTLE MORE MATURE,
A LITTLE MORE--"

04:36.450 --> 04:39.366
I HATE TO USE THE WORD "SEXY"
FOR A 15-YEAR-OLD,

04:39.366 --> 04:41.803
BUT ESSENTIALLY THAT'S
WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.675
NEVE CAME IN,
READ, WALKED OUT,

04:44.675 --> 04:47.548
AND I REMEMBER ALL OF US
TURNING TO SUSAN EDELMAN,
WHO WAS OUR CASTING DIRECTOR,

04:47.548 --> 04:50.333
AND SAYING, "WHY ARE
YOU JUST SITTING HERE?
GET ON THE PHONE!"

04:50.333 --> 04:54.729
I REALLY LIKED THIS GUY,
AND HE DUMPED ME, BAILEY.

04:54.729 --> 04:57.122
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY

04:57.122 --> 04:59.560
'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW THAT FEELS.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.823
AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME
THAT IT'S GONNA BE OK

05:01.823 --> 05:03.433
'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT IT IS.

05:06.654 --> 05:08.786
GOD, THERE'S NO ONE.

05:08.786 --> 05:12.007
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO ONE
TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.101
PLEASE, BAILEY...

05:19.101 --> 05:22.365
PLEASE JUST GO AWAY.

05:22.365 --> 05:23.497
OK?

05:27.022 --> 05:30.330
AND FINALLY, THEY BROUGHT US,
UM, YOU KNOW, TO FOX
AND TO COLUMBIA,

05:30.330 --> 05:32.680
AND THEY PAIRED US UP,
YOU KNOW, AS A FAMILY,

05:32.680 --> 05:34.246
AND IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL.

05:34.246 --> 05:36.161
ALL OF US WERE WAITING
IN THE WAITING ROOM,

05:36.161 --> 05:39.861
AND THEN THEY INVITED
LACEY, NEVE, SCOTT,
AND I INTO THE ROOM.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.732
LIKE, WELL,
"SHOULD WE TELL THEM?
SHOULD WE TELL THEM?"

05:41.732 --> 05:43.821
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS
DEFINITELY BAD NEWS.

05:43.821 --> 05:46.998
AND THEY TOLD
THEM THAT, YOU KNOW,
GUESS WHAT, YOU KNOW,

05:46.998 --> 05:49.653
YOU GUYS ARE OUR FAMILY,
OUR SALINGERS AND...

05:49.653 --> 05:51.612
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE THE SALINGERS.

05:51.612 --> 05:54.179
WE GOT IT. IT WAS GREAT.
IT WAS VERY, VERY EXCITING.

05:54.179 --> 05:55.485
SALINGER, PARTY OF 5.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.226
Wolf:
WE JUST WENT NUTS,

05:57.226 --> 05:59.402
AND WE'RE HUGGING
EACH OTHER,

05:59.402 --> 06:01.361
AND WE ALL JUST
SORT OF HUDDLED UP

06:01.361 --> 06:03.101
AND JUST, SORT OF,
WERE LOOKING AROUND,

06:03.101 --> 06:05.408
JUST LOOKING AT
EACH OTHER'S EYES.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.367
AND EVERYONE WAS
SORT OF SHORT OF BREATH

06:07.367 --> 06:09.717
AND EXCITED.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.762
BUT YOU COULD
[SNAPS FINGERS]

06:11.762 --> 06:13.764
SENSE RIGHT THERE
THAT THIS WAS GONNA
BE SOMETHING

06:13.764 --> 06:16.419
THAT WAS--WAS
VERY SPECIAL.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.378
YOU KNEW THAT WE WERE
GOING SOMEPLACE.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.558
KIDS AND DOGS,

06:24.558 --> 06:29.258
WHICH HAS PRESENTED
PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT
THE COURSE OF THE SHOW.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.912
Assistant Director:
TAKE 7.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.783
ONE OF THE FUNNIEST THINGS
THAT I REMEMBER WAS,

06:32.783 --> 06:35.003
UH, WE WERE
DOING THE PILOT,

06:35.003 --> 06:37.527
AND IT WAS
THE FIRST SCENE WE SHOT.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.573
AND I THINK
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

06:39.573 --> 06:41.531
THE FIRST SCENE...

06:41.531 --> 06:43.794
IN--SHOT, EVER,
OF PARTY OF FIVE.

06:43.794 --> 06:46.971
AND NEVE HAD
TO HOLD THE BABY...

06:46.971 --> 06:48.103
[BABY FUSSING]

06:48.103 --> 06:50.061
[CRYING]

06:50.061 --> 06:53.674
AND THIS BABY
IS JUST CRYING--
SCREAMING AND CRYING.

06:53.674 --> 06:57.068
[CRYING]
SHH SHH SHH...

06:57.068 --> 06:58.592
A.D.: PARTY TAKE ONE...

06:58.592 --> 06:59.810
Wolf: THIS BABY
JUST DOES NOT WANT
TO BE CHANGED,

06:59.810 --> 07:01.943
DOESN'T WANT
TO BE ON THE SET,

07:01.943 --> 07:04.075
JUST IS NOT INTERESTED
IN ANYTHING, AND
SHE HAS TO HUG HIM.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.033
[BABY TALKING]

07:05.033 --> 07:07.949
[GIGGLING]

07:07.949 --> 07:10.212
[BEEP] A.D.: 28-DAVID,
TAKE 6, PICKUP LINES.

07:10.212 --> 07:11.648
[CRYING]

07:11.648 --> 07:12.649
DON'T START.

07:12.649 --> 07:14.695
[CRYING LOUDER]

07:14.695 --> 07:16.871
Wolf: JUST THE LOOK
ON HER FACE--I FELT
SO BADLY FOR HER.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.089
WAAAAAH!

07:18.089 --> 07:20.178
I EVEN OFFERED
AT ONE POINT--

07:20.178 --> 07:22.050
I WAS, LIKE, "BAILEY
CAN CHANGE THE BABY
IN THIS SCENE."

07:22.050 --> 07:23.443
BUT SHE WAS JUST
STRUGGLING THROUGH IT.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.183
AND THAT WAS, LIKE,
OUR FIRST TASTE

07:25.183 --> 07:28.317
OF WHAT IT WAS GONNA
MEAN TO BE WORKING
WITH BABIES...

07:28.317 --> 07:29.579
[HICCUPS]

07:29.579 --> 07:31.363
AND WITH DOGS.
[RUFF]

07:31.363 --> 07:33.017
I USED TO GET ALL
THE SCENES WITH HIM.

07:33.017 --> 07:35.150
NOT THAT I DIDN'T LIKE HIM,

07:35.150 --> 07:37.500
BUT HE WAS ALWAYS
SLOBBERING ON ME,
AND HE WAS FAT.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.546
HE'S SWEET, THOUGH.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.983
COME ON.
BE A REAL DOG FOR ONCE.

07:41.983 --> 07:45.160
WE HAVE THIS PHRASE, UH--
"JUST LOOK AT THE DOG."

07:45.160 --> 07:46.378
[GRRRR]

07:46.378 --> 07:48.772
AND IT CAME FROM THE PILOT,
BECAUSE--

07:48.772 --> 07:51.471
IT WAS ABOUT MID--
IT WAS MAYBE, LIKE,
12:30 AT NIGHT.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.908
AND BECAUSE OF THE PERMITS
THEY HAD AT THIS HOUSE,

07:53.908 --> 07:55.518
WE HAD TO GET THIS SHOT
AND MOVE ON.

07:55.518 --> 07:59.043
AND, LITERALLY,
GUYS ARE RUNNING IN
WITH STANDS AND LIGHTS--

07:59.043 --> 08:01.524
RUNNING--AND THINGS ARE
WOBBLING AND THEY'RE--

08:01.524 --> 08:03.221
"ROLLING! ROLLING!
LET'S GO!"

08:03.221 --> 08:06.137
AND SOMEONE LEANS IN--
THE DIRECTOR LEANS IN
AND SAYS,

08:06.137 --> 08:08.313
"AT THE END OF THE SHOT,
LOOK AT THE DOG."

08:08.313 --> 08:11.316
AND, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE,
BEING, YOU KNOW, ACTOR BOY,

08:11.316 --> 08:14.189
I KIND OF SAID, "WHY?"

08:14.189 --> 08:17.671
AND ABOUT 8 PEOPLE
TURNED AND JUST WENT,
"JUST LOOK AT THE DOG!"

08:20.761 --> 08:22.850
SO THAT BECAME
OUR LITTLE SLOGAN

08:22.850 --> 08:26.636
FOR "DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.
JUST DO WHAT WE NEED YOU
TO DO."

08:28.595 --> 08:31.685
Matthew: I THINK WE HAD 3 WEEKS
TO SHOOT THE PILOT

08:31.685 --> 08:35.645
AND TO CREATE A FAMILY
AND TO MAKE THESE BROTHERS
AND SISTERS BELIEVABLE.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.473
YOU MISSED DINNER,
YOU KNOW.

08:37.473 --> 08:39.649
IT'S OK.
I'LL GRAB SOMETHING.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.303
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN, JULIA.

08:41.303 --> 08:42.870
YOU MISSED DINNER.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.828
SO WHAT? IT'S NOT
THE END OF THE WORLD.

08:44.828 --> 08:47.265
IT'S THE ONE THING
WE AGREED TO DO
TOGETHER.

08:47.265 --> 08:50.747
THIS IS 6 MONTHS AFTER THEIR
PARENTS HAVE PASSED AWAY.

08:50.747 --> 08:53.402
AND THERE'S, SORT OF,
ALL THESE STRANGE
DYNAMICS GOING ON.

08:53.402 --> 08:56.623
OK. SO TOMORROW
WE GO TO MR. GRAHAM

08:56.623 --> 08:57.580
AND WE ASK HIM
FOR AN ADVANCE.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.581
NO.

08:58.581 --> 08:59.974
WHY NOT?
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.498
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT
TO SEEM IN CHARGE!

09:02.498 --> 09:04.674
WE'VE GOT TO SEEM
LIKE WE CAN HANDLE
EVERYTHING OURSELVES,

09:04.674 --> 09:06.067
LIKE A NORMAL FAMILY,

09:06.067 --> 09:09.549
OR ELSE THEY
HAVE AN EXCUSE
TO SPLIT US UP.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.377
GREAT, CHARLIE.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.988
THANKS.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.163

09:18.732 --> 09:20.429
Lacey: TOWARDS THE END
OF THE EPISODE,

09:20.429 --> 09:23.258
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
TURNED OUT TO BE
THE FAMILY

09:23.258 --> 09:25.086
AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS
AND CONNECTIONS
WITH EACH OTHER.

09:25.086 --> 09:29.656
JULIA, I FIGURE THERE IS
SO MUCH THAT I DON'T KNOW

09:29.656 --> 09:32.963
THAT ALL I CAN DO...

09:32.963 --> 09:35.705
IS GRAB ON TO THE STUFF
THAT I'M SURE OF.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.664
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
THE FIVE OF US,

09:37.664 --> 09:39.970
THE FIVE OF US
HAVE TO STAY TOGETHER
AS LONG AS WE CAN.

09:39.970 --> 09:43.060
IT JUST FEELS RIGHT,
DOESN'T IT?

09:43.060 --> 09:46.586
IT'S THE SAME THING
WITH THIS DINNER THING.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.240
IT'S JUST--I KNOW WE
HAVE TO KEEP THAT GOING.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.591
WHY?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.984
BECAUSE IT MATTERS.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.725
IT MATTERS TO ME.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.379
IT MATTERS
TO THE OTHERS.

10:00.251 --> 10:03.864
AND I KNOW IT WOULD HAVE
MATTERED TO MOM AND DAD.

10:06.388 --> 10:09.391
Wolf: I DON'T THINK PEOPLE
TUNED IN AT THAT POINT,

10:09.391 --> 10:11.306
AND TO THIS POINT,

10:11.306 --> 10:12.524
TO SEE A GROUP OF ACTORS

10:12.524 --> 10:13.961
PRETENDING
TO LOVE EACH OTHER.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.311
YOU ACTUALLY SEE
A GROUP OF PEOPLE

10:16.311 --> 10:17.704
WHO CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.357
HOW ABOUT THAT?

10:19.357 --> 10:20.968
WE JUST MIGHT MANAGE.

10:20.968 --> 10:21.795
Julia: SO WHAT'S
EVERYONE HAVING?

10:23.884 --> 10:26.277
SHOVE OVER, CHARLIE.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.931

10:27.931 --> 10:31.326
TOO BAD KIRSTEN COULDN'T
COME TONIGHT, HUH, BAY?

10:31.326 --> 10:32.675

10:32.675 --> 10:33.676
SHE'S OUR NEW NANNY.

10:33.676 --> 10:34.677
OH, YEAH?

10:34.677 --> 10:35.678

HIRED SOMEONE?

10:37.854 --> 10:39.073

A NUMBER 2 PENCIL

10:53.783 --> 10:56.351

11:02.923 --> 11:06.361

11:17.067 --> 11:20.288

11:20.288 --> 11:22.943

11:22.943 --> 11:25.119
I--DO I HAVE A CAT?!

11:25.119 --> 11:27.338
YOU'RE GIVING ME A CAT?

11:27.338 --> 11:30.341
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I HAD A CAT, I SWEAR TO GOD!

11:30.341 --> 11:32.474
I HAVE A CAT?!
WHEN DID I GET A CAT?

11:32.474 --> 11:34.432
OK. SO I GUESS
THIS IS KIND OF LIKE

11:34.432 --> 11:35.956
A CONSOLATION PRIZE,
RIGHT?

11:35.956 --> 11:38.175

GAIN A PET?

11:38.175 --> 11:39.524
HEY...

11:39.524 --> 11:41.701
WHAT EPISODE
DID THAT HAPPEN IN?

11:41.701 --> 11:44.747
WAS THAT MY ADOPTIVE PARENTS?
DID THEY GIVE ME A CAT?

11:44.747 --> 11:48.446
SO I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
KEEPING AN EYE ON HER,

11:48.446 --> 11:50.057
YOU KNOW, WHILE I'M GONE?

11:50.057 --> 11:52.059
THE CAT! I REMEMBER THAT.

11:52.059 --> 11:54.409
I HAD A CAT FOR ONE EPISODE,

11:54.409 --> 11:56.019
AND HE WAS IN A CAGE

11:56.019 --> 11:57.934
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO
BE HELD DURING THE SCENE.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.328
NOW I REMEMBER.
IT'S AN ORANGE CAT.

12:00.328 --> 12:01.982
I REMEMBER THE CAT. OK.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.461
ALL RIGHT.

12:03.461 --> 12:04.854
I DID HAVE A CAT.

12:09.119 --> 12:11.905
THE, UH--TSHH--I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW I HAD A CAT,

12:11.905 --> 12:15.909
SO THAT QUES--TRIGGER.
I HAVE NO IDEA.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.694
BARNEY. I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT WAS THE CAT'S NAME?

12:18.694 --> 12:20.914
WELL, AMANDA JUST HATES
TRAVELING WITH ME.

12:20.914 --> 12:23.003
I MEAN, STUCK
IN THAT BOX ALL DAY,
WHO CAN BLAME HER?

12:24.482 --> 12:27.050
THE CAT REALLY--OK.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.879
ALL RIGHT. GOOD.

12:29.879 --> 12:34.144
Announcer: COMING UP,
THE SALINGERS' MOST
DRAMATIC THANKSGIVING...

12:34.144 --> 12:37.452
AND HOW THE PARTY ALMOST ENDED
BEFORE IT BEGAN

12:37.452 --> 12:39.759
WHEN PARTY OF FIVE:
A FAMILY ALBUM CONTINUES.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.377
DINNER IS SERVED.

12:49.377 --> 12:51.031
Claudia: BAILEY MADE DINNER?

12:51.031 --> 12:52.989
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THEY ONLY GIVE YOU
6 MEATBALLS IN A CAN?

12:52.989 --> 12:54.599
IS THAT A RIPOFF?

12:57.298 --> 13:01.041
GOSH, WE MUST HAVE DONE
6 OR 7 EPISODES BEFORE
IT EVEN STARTED AIRING.

13:01.041 --> 13:03.478
AND IT WAS
DOING REALLY BAD
IN THE BEGINNING.

13:03.478 --> 13:06.002
YOU THINK IT'S ALWAYS
GONNA BE LIKE THIS FOR US?

13:07.612 --> 13:10.050
NO.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.052
MAYBE THESE ARE
THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.056
Fox: I REMEMBER THAT,
IN THE BEGINNING,

13:16.056 --> 13:18.449
I WAS A LITTLE BIT
FRUSTRATED AND--AND,

13:18.449 --> 13:20.364
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
"WHY AREN'T PEOPLE
CATCHING ON TO THIS?"

13:20.364 --> 13:22.105
THERE'S A WAY
TO HANDLE THESE PEOPLE.

13:25.369 --> 13:28.155
NOT THAT I HAVE
THE SLIGHTEST CLUE
WHAT IT IS.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.289
Wolf: ALL I COULD DO
WAS KEEP WORKING,

13:32.289 --> 13:34.857
KEEP GOING TO WORK
AND HOPING WE WEREN'T

13:34.857 --> 13:37.686
GONNA GET TOLD THAT MORNING
THAT WE WERE DONE.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.731
WHAT DO YOU GOT?
NOTHING!

13:39.731 --> 13:41.777
WHAT DO YOU GOT? NADA!

13:41.777 --> 13:43.823
WHAT DO YOU GOT? ZILCH!

13:43.823 --> 13:46.695
AND FOR A WHILE,
OUR FIRST SEASON,
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS LIKE.

13:46.695 --> 13:49.437
YOU KNOW, WE'D COME TO WORK
AND JUST REALLY HOPE

13:49.437 --> 13:51.831
THAT THIS WASN'T GONNA
BE THE DAY WHERE THEY SAY

13:51.831 --> 13:52.614
WE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

13:57.401 --> 14:00.404
WALTER ALCOTT WAS RELEASED
FROM PRISON LAST WEEK.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.540
HE WANTS TO SEE YOU.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.108
THE THANKSGIVING EPISODE
IN THE VERY FIRST SEASON

14:08.108 --> 14:10.371
WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITES,

14:10.371 --> 14:12.939
WHEN THEY DEAL
WITH THE DRUNK DRIVER

14:12.939 --> 14:14.592
WHO KILLED THEIR PARENTS.

14:14.592 --> 14:15.811
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU WANT TO SEE HIM?

14:15.811 --> 14:17.204
I'M NOT SURE.

14:17.204 --> 14:19.771
FORGET IT.
HE CAN SHOVE HIS APOLOGY.

14:19.771 --> 14:20.729
IT DOESN'T DO ME ANY GOOD.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.209
IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST

14:22.209 --> 14:24.559
MORE REALLY, REALLY DRAMATIC
EPISODES THAT WE HAD--

14:24.559 --> 14:26.213
WELL, THEY'RE ALL
PRETTY DRAMATIC.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.215
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW,
A REALLY BIG EPISODE

14:28.215 --> 14:29.738
THAT WE HAD DONE TOGETHER.

HE'S GONNA WALK SOON,

14:44.100 --> 14:46.973
AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA
SEE IT BECAUSE OF YOU!

14:46.973 --> 14:49.845
BECAUSE YOU HAD
A FEW DRINKS!

14:49.845 --> 14:52.282
AND YOU GOT IN YOUR CAR,
AND YOU WENT THROUGH
THAT INTERSECTION,

14:52.282 --> 14:53.675
AND YOU KILLED THEM!

14:53.675 --> 14:57.374
THE ONLY THING
I CAN DO FOR YOU...

14:57.374 --> 15:00.334
IS TELL YOU THAT
WE'RE GONNA BE OK.

15:00.334 --> 15:02.118
GO SEE HIM, CHARLIE.
IT'LL HELP.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.206
YEAH, HIM.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.993

IT'S HARD.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.299
BUT IT'S NOT
THE HARDEST THING
IN THE WORLD

15:09.299 --> 15:10.822
TO SAY, "I FORGIVE YOU."

15:12.302 --> 15:14.478
YES, IT IS.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.236

SOMETHING BEHIND,

15:33.236 --> 15:34.934
KIND OF AS A WAY
OF SHOWING THEY WERE HERE.

I THINK THE ONE THING
ABOUT PARTY OF FIVE

15:40.635 --> 15:42.376

ARE THE ISSUES
THEY FACE

15:42.376 --> 15:44.726
ARE TIMELESS.

38:18.339 --> 38:19.645
IS IT THAT SERIOUS?

38:19.645 --> 38:22.387
NO. HE--HE'S JUST
GOT A WAYS TO GO

38:22.387 --> 38:23.518
BEFORE
THE INFECTION'S GONE.

38:23.518 --> 38:25.303
BUT...

38:25.303 --> 38:27.435
JUDGING
FROM HIS ENERGY

38:27.435 --> 38:28.915
AND THE FACT
THAT HE'S ALERT,

38:28.915 --> 38:30.264
I'D SAY IT LOOKS,
YOU KNOW...

38:31.831 --> 38:33.311
NOT THAT BAD.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.667
I'M SORRY.
COULD YOU, UM...

38:41.667 --> 38:43.146
COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN?

38:50.458 --> 38:54.157
NO, IT'S JUST, UM...

38:54.157 --> 38:55.768
RIGHT.

38:55.768 --> 38:58.074
RIGHT.

38:58.074 --> 39:00.425
COULD YOU GIVE...

39:00.425 --> 39:03.079
I'M SORRY, COULD YOU JUST
GIVE ME A SECOND HERE?

39:05.386 --> 39:09.477
Fox: WHEN HE FOUND OUT
THAT HE WAS IN REMISSION
AND THAT HE WAS FINE,

39:09.477 --> 39:11.784
THAT WAS REALLY THE FIRST TIME
THAT WE'VE SEEN HIM

39:11.784 --> 39:14.047
THAT HE FELT LIKE, "MY GOD,"

39:14.047 --> 39:16.310
YOU KNOW,
"I GOT A SECOND CHANCE HERE."

39:20.619 --> 39:21.794

39:51.127 --> 39:52.477
[GIRLS LAUGH]

39:52.477 --> 39:55.697

OF THE FOUR OF US

40:09.885 --> 40:11.452
WHO HAS CHANGED THE MOST
SINCE WE BEGAN.

40:11.452 --> 40:13.193
IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

40:13.193 --> 40:16.152
WHAT IS THIS, CLAUD,
LIKE SOME BIG EMERGENCY
OR SOMETHING?

40:16.152 --> 40:17.240
YEAH, IT IS.

40:20.243 --> 40:21.723
I JUST GOT MY PERIOD.

40:23.899 --> 40:25.466
OH.

40:25.466 --> 40:28.121
THESE HAVE WINGS.

40:28.121 --> 40:29.165
WINGS?

40:29.165 --> 40:30.993
WHAT IS THAT ABOUT, HUH?

40:30.993 --> 40:33.561
UH, I DON'T THINK
THESE ARE RIGHT. HERE.

40:33.561 --> 40:36.477
IT'S A LITTLE STRANGE, YOU KNOW,
GROWING UP IN REAL LIFE

40:36.477 --> 40:38.261
AND ON TELEVISION,
KNOWING THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE

40:38.261 --> 40:40.612
ARE WATCHING YOU AND KIND OF
MONITORING, YOU KNOW...

40:40.612 --> 40:43.615
MONITORING WHAT
YOU LOOK LIKE EVERY WEEK
AND HOW YOU'RE CHANGING.

40:43.615 --> 40:46.879
WHY IS IT SO IMPOSSIBLE
THAT I COULD HAVE FEELINGS
ABOUT--ABOUT...

40:46.879 --> 40:49.055
YOU KNOW, GUY STUFF?!

40:49.055 --> 40:52.624
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE,
I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN,
I MAY BE SMALL FOR MY AGE--

40:52.624 --> 40:55.801
WELL, I DO, OK?! I MEAN,
I--I DO HAVE THOSE FEELINGS.

40:57.672 --> 41:00.849
SO YOU BETTER
JUST GET USED TO IT.

41:00.849 --> 41:03.025
I REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS 13, YOU KNOW,

41:03.025 --> 41:06.028
I WAS--I WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HANDLE
ALL WHAT SHE HANDLES.

41:06.028 --> 41:07.943
AY, CLAUDIA.

41:09.423 --> 41:12.470
SOMETIME, THE HEART
DO WHAT IT WANT

41:12.470 --> 41:14.472
WITHOUT ASKING THE HEAD.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.038
I HAD NEVER
KISSED ANYONE BEFORE,

41:16.038 --> 41:18.388
AND I HADN'T HAD
A BOYFRIEND OR ANYTHING YET,

41:18.388 --> 41:21.304
AND SO, YOU KNOW, I READ
THE SCRIPT AND WENT, "OK."

41:21.304 --> 41:23.698
YOU KNOW, I HAD NO IDEA,
LIKE, WHAT TO DO.

41:23.698 --> 41:25.134
[TIME AFTER TIME PLAYING]

41:27.963 --> 41:29.530
Chabert: IT WAS REALLY
NERVOUS, YOU KNOW?

41:29.530 --> 41:32.098
I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS ON SET.
I'D NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

41:38.147 --> 41:40.933
AND EVEN KNOWING
IT'S FAKE, YOU KNOW,

41:40.933 --> 41:42.543
IT WAS STILL--
THERE WAS SOME PART OF ME

41:42.543 --> 41:45.241
THAT, YOU KNOW,
FELT IT WAS REAL.

41:56.731 --> 41:58.864
DOING A--A SHOW LIKE THIS

41:58.864 --> 42:02.432
IS THE--ONE OF THE FEW CHANCES
WE GET TO ACTUALLY SORT OF...

42:02.432 --> 42:04.086

42:11.746 --> 42:13.792
IF THEY HADN'T

42:13.792 --> 42:15.881
THERE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
THE SECOND SEASON

42:15.881 --> 42:17.752
