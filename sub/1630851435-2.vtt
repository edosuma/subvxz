WEBVTT

01:43.436 --> 01:46.481
Baki headed to the hideout with me.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.027
It was strange.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.947
It was a residential area,

01:54.030 --> 01:57.951
but it was full of graffiti
like a public restroom in the city.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.495
And if you looked closely

02:00.578 --> 02:03.081
most were smears against Baki.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.499
BAKI, YOU BASTARD

02:04.582 --> 02:06.709
There's so much graffiti.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.046
They don't stand a chance against me,

02:11.381 --> 02:13.383
so they fight through graffiti.

02:14.592 --> 02:16.761
The strongest high schooler in the world.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.309
Graffiti even on your house.

02:31.734 --> 02:34.863
Baki began to stretch in his room.

02:35.363 --> 02:37.240
His body was unbelievably flexible.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.288
Um, about what you said earlier.

02:44.581 --> 02:48.835
About your shadow-boxing opponent.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.378
Yeah.

02:50.920 --> 02:55.049
That Iron Michael was only a warm up.

02:57.468 --> 03:00.513
You're going to fight your father, right?

03:01.389 --> 03:05.560
My old man and I don't
really see eye to eye.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.813
Your father is strong, isn't he?

03:12.233 --> 03:16.070
The unequivocal champion
over all life on Earth, bar none.

03:16.779 --> 03:19.574
Lions, tigers, elephants, orcas…

03:20.283 --> 03:22.160
even cancer cells are no match for him.

03:23.578 --> 03:27.498
His father was supposed to be an enemy,
but when he spoke of his strength,

03:27.582 --> 03:30.084
he sounded a little proud for some reason.

03:31.794 --> 03:35.048
So, to prepare to fight your father

03:35.131 --> 03:37.592
you're going to meet
this strong opponent now?

03:38.468 --> 03:40.511
A man who surpasses even Iron.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.096
What kind of monster is he?

03:42.931 --> 03:43.765
Hey.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.559
He's in here.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.773
Is that a basement?

03:59.656 --> 04:01.324
It's empty and dark.

04:01.908 --> 04:05.245
A barren room with only
the table over there.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.373
Um…

04:09.540 --> 04:11.960
My old man acknowledged me as an opponent.

04:13.169 --> 04:16.130
He apparently fought against
a dino-sized African Elephant.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.510
Stronger than a lion,
tiger or brown bear,

04:21.094 --> 04:24.264
the strongest, biggest
African Elephant on Earth.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.895
In that case, who should I fight?

04:39.570 --> 04:40.405
It's coming!

04:45.076 --> 04:45.910
Rumina,

04:46.703 --> 04:49.914
the opponent stronger
than an elephant is already here.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.293
It's been here on that desk.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.883
Huh? What?

05:02.510 --> 05:04.387
Stronger than an elephant?

05:04.470 --> 05:05.346
This guy?

05:07.974 --> 05:09.600
Um, this…

05:10.768 --> 05:12.603
That's right, a praying mantis.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.565
This?

05:16.441 --> 05:19.068
When it comes strictly
to fighting one-on-one,

05:19.152 --> 05:21.237
insects are the pros among pros.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.822
Beasts don't compare.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.199
No way.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.909
I'm not pulling your chain.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.580
First, their power is on another level.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.333
Power?

05:34.083 --> 05:39.339
Tigers and lions barely manage
to drag an approximately 800 kg prey.

05:39.922 --> 05:43.843
Even if they weigh 200 kg,
that's three to four times their weight.

05:43.926 --> 05:46.095
Then how about insects?

05:46.846 --> 05:48.890
They carry prey seven to eight times

05:48.973 --> 05:52.643
their weight and easily transport them
long-distance, nonstop to their lair.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.356
Let's say you weigh 30 kg, Rumina.

05:56.939 --> 06:01.361
Imagine carrying a 200 kg man
from school to home.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.614
Yeah, that's impossible.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.410
A deer that can jump
ten meters isn't uncommon,

06:10.203 --> 06:13.539
but it's child's play compared
to a flea or grasshopper.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.210
If they were human-sized,

06:17.293 --> 06:20.129
they could easily jump
over a ten-story building.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.965
You feel it when you hold them.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.636
They weigh a few thousand times
less than us,

06:27.261 --> 06:30.640
yet your fingertips feel their power.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.143
If you weighed the same,
you'd never beat them.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.896
If you were kicked by that leg,

06:37.730 --> 06:40.983
or held by those front legs and pinned…

06:42.235 --> 06:44.195
If you were caught in those tusks,

06:44.946 --> 06:46.656
you wouldn't walk away in one piece.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.076
And that praying mantis.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.624
He is the consummate pro fighter.

06:57.750 --> 07:01.087
It's a well-known fact the ancient
Chinese martial art of Mantis Boxing

07:01.170 --> 07:04.382
was created in the style
of the praying mantis.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.217
Their blow,

07:06.300 --> 07:08.386
their grind, their bite,

07:08.469 --> 07:10.096
their violent nature.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.598
They're top-notch in all they do.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.309
They have no weakness,

07:15.393 --> 07:16.769
a complete martial artist.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.440
If they weighed over 100 kg,

07:21.190 --> 07:23.568
they would definitely prey
on the African Elephant.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.988
But, it's small…

07:27.864 --> 07:29.115
I'm going to make it big.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.534
To a hundred kilograms?

07:32.118 --> 07:34.537
With this and this.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.998
He's from faraway America.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.208
In fact he no longer even exists.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.545
But I brought the champion
Iron Michael from the heyday

07:42.628 --> 07:44.297
to the Tama River riverbank.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.551
Michael doesn't exist in this world,
but he appeared.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.845
I can create it.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.392
I can create a match
with a 100 kg praying mantis.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.576
He moved!

08:14.285 --> 08:16.662
It's the kick that beat Iron Michael!

08:23.002 --> 08:24.921
Baki is nervous.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.467
He's nervous of an invisible,
imaginary praying mantis

08:29.550 --> 08:31.552
created in his mind.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.430
The angle of his face changed.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.015
He's looking up.

08:37.016 --> 08:39.852
What sort of monster does he see?

08:50.238 --> 08:51.697
It's just like Baki said.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.242
A 100 kg praying mantis

08:54.325 --> 08:58.371
is far stronger
than a 200 kg tiger or lion.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.715
Th-This is…

09:10.299 --> 09:11.175
No way!

09:12.301 --> 09:13.219
Could it be?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.889
He's caught by the praying mantis!

09:20.059 --> 09:21.227
He hit his mark!

09:22.103 --> 09:22.937
It's dead!

09:23.020 --> 09:24.230
A clean hit!

09:30.736 --> 09:35.741
He should just turn the praying mantis
weak and easily beatable.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.536
He should just crush it.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.455
He's so tough on himself.

09:46.752 --> 09:50.256
Normal martial arts
won't work against a real mantis.

09:51.048 --> 09:54.176
Baki's moves were slowly
becoming something else.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.848
Baki is moving in a dim room.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.518
He's attacking empty air.

10:02.602 --> 10:06.272
He's blocking attacks from empty air.

10:06.355 --> 10:07.481
I watched him,

10:08.107 --> 10:10.026
trying not to miss a thing.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.613
I kept following Baki's dizzying moves.

10:14.905 --> 10:15.740
I kept watching…

10:17.617 --> 10:18.534
And then…

10:20.161 --> 10:21.787
Just as if you see a case,

10:21.871 --> 10:24.290
you could picture
the shape of what goes in it.

10:24.874 --> 10:29.378
Or if you see a cover,
you could picture the size of the book.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.173
Or with a pendant like this,

10:32.256 --> 10:35.092
you could picture another similar pendant.

10:36.510 --> 10:37.637
You begin to see

10:38.888 --> 10:40.640
within the empty space,

10:41.641 --> 10:42.808
slowly…

10:44.060 --> 10:46.729
The form of something that doesn't exist.
Slowly…

10:47.897 --> 10:50.941
Slowly, but surely…

10:52.985 --> 10:54.111
you begin to see!

10:54.695 --> 10:56.656
What Baki created,

10:56.739 --> 10:59.075
was just a bug, but it was over 100 kg.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.578
When you're actually faced with it,

11:02.662 --> 11:04.789
it almost makes you laugh,

11:04.872 --> 11:06.582
you feel so hopeless.

11:07.708 --> 11:11.337
Baki was openly facing such a thing!

11:14.548 --> 11:16.676
It's the strongest in the world,

11:16.759 --> 11:21.639
so Baki's father apparently
beat a dino-sized African elephant.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.643
But no matter how strong
the African elephant may be,

11:26.477 --> 11:29.730
it has that advantage because of its size.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.485
If they were the size of an insect,

11:34.568 --> 11:36.404
their strength would be that of a…

11:37.697 --> 11:38.698
Caterpillar.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.034
It happened suddenly…

11:43.494 --> 11:45.037
Baki's specialty high-kick.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.498
The speed, the timing,

11:47.581 --> 11:49.041
everything was just right!

11:49.625 --> 11:51.544
I expected a knockout.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.301
I see.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.223
My bad hunch was right.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.728
The head of a praying mantis
essentially has no brain.

12:10.771 --> 12:14.775
Concussions don't happen
like they always do in humans.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.278
Attacks to the head don't work.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.532
He did it!

12:21.615 --> 12:23.784
Don't let it go!

12:24.869 --> 12:26.036
What's this?

12:27.496 --> 12:29.290
He's watching me.

12:30.124 --> 12:33.377
I've got its back,
but he can clearly see me!

12:33.461 --> 12:34.295
Not only that,

12:35.045 --> 12:36.797
it's frighteningly deft!

12:38.924 --> 12:40.551
I'll be eaten!

12:45.765 --> 12:47.516
It's so strong!

12:49.143 --> 12:52.521
Crazy to have a strength contest
against an insect!

13:01.989 --> 13:03.032
No matter…

13:03.657 --> 13:04.950
No matter who the opponent.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.662
Human, beast, or insect,

13:08.746 --> 13:10.372
it won't change what I do.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.833
There's only one thing to do.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.418
Fight…

13:15.544 --> 13:16.504
Fight…

13:17.463 --> 13:18.297
like usual!

13:19.673 --> 13:21.425
It's so hard!

13:22.885 --> 13:24.428
It's like steel!

13:25.763 --> 13:26.889
But I'll do it!

13:31.435 --> 13:33.270
No matter what, I'll do it!

13:34.188 --> 13:36.106
I'll do it even if nothing happens!

13:36.774 --> 13:39.193
Sudden deaths and weaknesses
can go to shit!

13:40.945 --> 13:42.613
I'll do what I can!

13:43.948 --> 13:44.782
He got it!

13:45.366 --> 13:48.118
A human got ahold of
a mantis's reverse joint!

13:49.286 --> 13:50.120
Break it!

14:07.388 --> 14:11.058
Martial arts doesn't work on it!

14:14.395 --> 14:16.272
This isn't normal.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.315
He doesn't have to go so far.

14:18.983 --> 14:22.653
As effective as it may be
to realistically imagine an opponent,

14:23.237 --> 14:25.781
in reality,
there's no one in front of him.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.910
He's diligently using
his imagination in this empty space

14:30.452 --> 14:34.331
to create an illusion to fight it.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.293
It's not a match or battle,

14:37.376 --> 14:39.837
he doesn't need to take it this far.

14:40.504 --> 14:41.797
Baki, no more!

14:41.881 --> 14:43.340
You've done enough!

14:43.924 --> 14:46.343
No need to go so far, Baki!

14:46.427 --> 14:48.554
This is silly!

14:51.181 --> 14:52.683
He's no longer listening.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.270
My worries aside,

14:56.353 --> 14:58.814
it became even more realistic.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.444
You could almost feel its temperature.

15:11.535 --> 15:12.578
Just as I thought.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.956
With those eyes, it has no blind spot.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.751
No matter what direction it's facing,

15:18.834 --> 15:22.546
every corner of this room
is within his field of vision.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.965
There's no where to run.

15:26.675 --> 15:27.718
To run?

15:28.427 --> 15:31.221
Am I here to run away?

15:32.389 --> 15:33.474
With him too?

15:33.557 --> 15:37.478
Am I going to look for a place to run
when I fight him too?

15:39.563 --> 15:40.981
You've gotta be kidding.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.149
Think!

15:42.232 --> 15:44.610
A way to fight a praying mantis!

15:51.659 --> 15:53.911
I felt it under its neck.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.454
A soft spot.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.540
The attack I used, was this.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.710
This is Toroken!

16:07.508 --> 16:09.927
I guess I'll give it a try.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.726
Once upon a time, in China.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.816
There was a priest named, Shu Amon.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.568
Hm, what is that?

16:27.361 --> 16:31.198
One day, he saw something
extraordinary in the forest.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.076
What?

16:34.743 --> 16:36.745
A fight between a bird and insect?

16:37.413 --> 16:39.832
A sparrow versus a praying mantis.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.420
The sparrow will win
no matter how you look at it.

16:45.921 --> 16:46.839
Huh?

16:47.631 --> 16:48.465
What?

16:49.633 --> 16:50.968
Oh my, oh my!

16:52.511 --> 16:54.430
To Amon's surprise,

16:54.513 --> 16:57.182
the praying mantis was the victor.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.105
I never expected the insect to win.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.441
Like this?

17:06.358 --> 17:07.609
Is it like this?

17:09.319 --> 17:13.115
The praying mantis's strength
struck Amon deeply,

17:14.241 --> 17:18.370
and he began to diligently research
their way of fighting.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.041
Until finally,

17:22.708 --> 17:25.419
he created a martial art.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.173
The name of that martial art is of course,

17:29.798 --> 17:32.092
Toroken!

17:34.678 --> 17:36.764
Baki changed his stance.

17:37.723 --> 17:38.849
That stance,

17:40.476 --> 17:44.563
seemed a mimicry of the praying mantis
rather than a fight pose.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.526
The world of martial arts is savage.

17:50.861 --> 17:54.073
There are ways of thinking
unimaginable in other sports.

17:55.115 --> 17:59.119
What exists in martial arts,
but not in other sports?

17:59.703 --> 18:00.537
That is…

18:01.371 --> 18:02.998
"Which is stronger?"

18:04.208 --> 18:08.087
There's no way baseball
and basketball would fight.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.882
But martial arts is different.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.052
The same style fights, of course.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.764
But they can fight other styles too.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.226
They can even fight other species.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.981
The inquiring human mind's
pursuit for strength runs deep.

18:29.650 --> 18:33.737
It's moved on from other species
to imaginary giant insects.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.492
And Baki has finally,

18:39.034 --> 18:41.036
made a 360 from
the world of other species,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.872
and stepped into the world
of same species martial arts.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.853
It's getting closer.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.312
Did you see, Rumina?

19:08.230 --> 19:11.525
They don't have
a natural enemy among insects.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.027
The end is drawing near.

19:15.362 --> 19:18.157
They've never received an attack.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.326
Their attacks are strong
and extraordinary,

19:21.410 --> 19:23.287
but they're empty-handed in defense.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.039
Move aside, Rumina.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.293
Baki is gonna win.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.303
This move…

19:42.181 --> 19:45.601
I'm starting… I'm starting to see it now.

19:46.143 --> 19:50.606
I thought this perfect all-around
martial artist was impenetrable.

19:51.106 --> 19:55.360
But within that figure here and there,
I see room to take advantage of.

19:57.571 --> 20:02.075
I see glimpses of
a clear weak point in that movement.

20:02.659 --> 20:03.911
Have I gotten used to it?

20:05.454 --> 20:06.955
To this fight?

20:07.539 --> 20:08.457
My body…

20:09.666 --> 20:10.834
is adjusting!

20:13.003 --> 20:17.466
My body is telling me
how to deal with him.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.136
Baki has changed somehow.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.890
His expression is somehow relaxed.

20:25.891 --> 20:26.767
His moves…

20:28.185 --> 20:29.269
somehow,

20:29.811 --> 20:31.063
aren't reckless.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.398
It was already…

20:34.650 --> 20:38.695
not mantis to mantis, but something else.

20:40.822 --> 20:41.698
Yes.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.577
It was like watching a bird
versus the mantis.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.206
The mantis that was so violent,

20:49.706 --> 20:51.333
now just keeps running.

20:52.167 --> 20:54.419
Baki seemed even more relaxed.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.922
He used to keep looking up,

20:59.258 --> 21:02.552
but the next thing I knew,
his gaze was lower than level.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.097
Rumina.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.599
If you find its weak point,

21:08.100 --> 21:10.435
it doesn't matter if it's
100 kg or life-sized.

21:18.694 --> 21:19.945
It disappeared!

21:20.028 --> 21:22.864
Now, where is the real one?

21:22.948 --> 21:25.158
Aha, there you are.

21:33.917 --> 21:34.751
Gotcha.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.048
There's no denying it!

21:40.757 --> 21:42.884
It's Baki's total victory!

23:13.308 --> 23:17.187
