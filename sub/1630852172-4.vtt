WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Gossip Girl here.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Or should I say "still here"?

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
GOSSIP GIRL:
You thought I was a person,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
but I never said I was.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
I'm a revolution.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
GOSSIP GIRL:
And today's act of rebellion?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
We know it isn't nice
to reveal a lady's age,

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
but secret sources tell us
Zoya Lott is 15 today.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
May you deserve
whatever you get.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
GOSSIP GIRL:  In New York,
there are only two ways

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
to celebrate a birthday.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
You either go big,
or you don't exist.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
But not to fear.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
-MAX WOLFE:  If you're
leaving a voicemail...

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
MAX:  ...you obviously
do not know me.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
GOSSIP GIRL:
Something tells us...

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
-GOSSIP GIRL:  ...this Z-Day

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Because if it doesn't,
then y'all ain't doing it right.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Suit up, sweeties...

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
and let's see who'll be
the last  manqué  standing.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
A little breakthrough

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
-

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
-

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
When the river runs dry

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Ever wake up in the morning

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
and feel like
something needs to change?

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
It can be pretty exhausting,
looking in the mirror each day

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
and promising yourself,

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
“Today I'm gonna look
the best I've ever looked.”

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
What if who I am when I wake up
is me at my best?

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Starting here, starting now,
I'm going clean.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Free. Effortlessly me.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I encourage you to try the same.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
God! "Effortlessly me"?
What is this?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
The new girl's Pantene ad?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Au naturel
is stage four terminal.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
-I almost can't look.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
You can needlepoint her pores!

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
-Oh, Jesus.
-Is everything ready for today?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Not a moment too soon.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
As soon as Jules is back on top,
we'll be too.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
DAVIS CALLOWAY: Gotta say,
it's nice to see you

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
LOLA: And I gotta say,
it's nice to see...

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
-LOLA: ...where you really live.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
-

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
-Are we expecting guests?
-Good morning, Julie!

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
-Good Morning, Lola.
-LOLA: I saw your story.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Filter-free is a new look
on you, and I like it.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
I have this great
nude foundation from Dior.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
No one would ever know
you were wearing,

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
if you wanted to go that route.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Thanks, but I think
that kind of contradicts

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
the whole "transparency" thing.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Right, right.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
I can't believe they send you
all this free stuff.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
I hope you don't mind.
I deep-dived

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
-Did you?
-LOLA: Well, I was so curious

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm trying to do the same thing
with my music, and...

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Anyway,

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I totally forgot
you were the kid

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
who interviewed
all those rock stars.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
You were so cute!

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
I've gotta go. Um.
Wish I wasn't meeting my friends

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
-at Locanda Verde before school.
-LOLA: Oh, no!

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
-Your dad didn't say.
-Well, who can keep track?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
I'll take one for the road.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Is this pumpkin?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Seasonally appropriate.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Hey.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Is this okay?
If it's too weird, I can--

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Go back to hiding her
in your secret apartment

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
-like Josef Fritzl?
-

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
-Point taken.
-We promised we'd try honesty.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
She clearly makes you happy.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Hey, I'm thinking of you today.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I'm thinking of you too.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
NICK LOTT: Hey, Z,
I can't find my briefcase.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Can you check the table?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Hold up, okay?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I know the rule.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
We don't celebrate
until tomorrow.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
-But that doesn't mean we have
to completely ignore--

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
-Today is her day. Not mine.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Well, this is yours.
Sadelle's, your favorite.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Had to wait in line
and everything, like a tourist.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Something tells me
you didn't make a wish.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Well, how's this?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I wish that today would go
completely unnoticed,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
so that I didn't have to,
yet again, be the girl

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
whose immunocompromised mom
died having her.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
-But Gossip Girl

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
How sweet.
People wanna wish you

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
ZOYA LOTT: There are
bigger things going on

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Like, repost
some Sonya Renee Taylor

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
instead of sending me
birthday memes?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
I don't even know Angelicah84,
or whatever a "Minka Kelly" is.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
-She's--
-Look, there's only one person

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
to blame for this. Julien.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I'm sure your sister
didn't send your birthday

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
in to Gossip Girl.
Besides, people know. Big deal.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
ZOYA: It had to be Julien.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Who else would know
it was my birthday?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Let me guess.
That's something bad too?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Bad stuff always happens
on my birthday.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
-ZOYA: Remember that sleepover,

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
when Bella didn't know
that she had bed bugs?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
This is just
a reminder to sign up

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
for trick-or-treaters
on Halloween.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Today is a good day.
This day brought me you.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Best thing
that ever happened to me.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Too bad it took
the worst thing to do it.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Z...

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Here's hoping for no surprises,
no celebrations,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
just a normal day.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
-Shit, dude. Overkill much?
-It's her birthday.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
The only thing
she should be thinking about

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
is whether she wants to start
her day with a croissant

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
-or a crepe.
-

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Wish all problems
were that easily solved.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
You and Audrey?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
She still doesn't know
who the girl is, right?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Kinda just been
avoiding each other recently.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Well, I hope
that you're not feeling guilty,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
'cause the only thing you did
is kiss some rando girl,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
and she, like, fucked someone

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
that you know, so that's
not equitable at all.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Well, I was just wondering if...

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
it's the first time
she branched out.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Well, have you talked to her?
Have you been direct?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
This is like a role reversal.
I'm giving you advice again.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
-Second time for everything.
-OBIE BERGMANN: I'm just saying,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
you're not gonna know
until you ask her. I'd just say

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
don't kiss anybody
else until you talk to her.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Yes.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Seriously? Not even concealer?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I hate you
for being so blessed.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Sending a posthumous thank you

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
to your mom on this day
of remembrance.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Thank you, Aud.
You can talk about you now.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Okay, so, I know
that we agreed to pretend

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
our mutual dalliances
with Max never happened,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
but I fear
it's irrevocably shifted

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
the dynamic between Ak and me.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Really? Sleeping with one
of your mutual,

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
best friends did that?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Fair, but for me,
it isn't about Max.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Well, it is,
but not in that way.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I slept with someone
of the opposite sex,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
which is unacceptable
but not abnormal.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Aki kissed a member
of the same sex.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
-Not normal at all.
-

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Is it possible
that he's attracted to men...

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
AUDREY HOPE: Obviously
he's attracted to men, Julien!

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
JULIEN CALLOWAY:
...and never told you

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
because you use words
like "normal."

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
Fair again. But, like,
is he bi? Is he gay?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
I mean, what if all this time
that we've been together,

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
he's been hiding
who he really is?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Just ask him. If he's gay,
or bi, whatever it is,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
he's probably scared
of how you'll react.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Just talk to him
without judgment

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
and listen to his response.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
And maybe stay far away
from Max till you do.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
-AUDREY: Are those crepes?
-

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Good morning, babe.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
-Um. We love you.
-But we are appalled.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Because he never did something
like this for me?

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
No. Because no one wants
to see anyone without a filter.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
People do not click to see
how similar you are to them.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
They click precisely
for the perverse pleasure

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
that comes
from worshipping someone

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
they could never be or have.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I need a break from all that.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
-Hmm?
-I wanna be more real,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
-more honest, more vulnerable.
-Vulnerability

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Right? You're royalty. Strong,
indestructible, unattainable.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Oh, I'm definitely that.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
JC, some news.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
A friend of mine at Condé says

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
he heard
they're going to offer you

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
a slot in one
of the spring  Vogues,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
shot by Tyler Mitchell

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
in a Bavarian palace
or something.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
-STUDENT: Yeah, let's
grab something.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Film me eating it?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
-Did she just turn down  Vogue?
-There was no  Vogue.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I just wanted to see
how far gone she really was.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I can almost forgive carbs
and a shiny forehead,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
but indifference
to a fashion spread?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Okay, well, what do we...
what do we do now?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
All those years of work
for nothing,

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
when it could have been Suri?
It could have been Zahara.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I-- I can't end up working
with my mom in biotech.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
-I just can't.
-Don't worry.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
The first missile's already
been launched.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
It may even have hit already.
And then we'll be on our way.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
-OBIE: Surprise!

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
I didn't know what mood
you would be in,

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
so I got
a lot of stuff going on.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
We got waffles,
we got tacos, we got crepes.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
-This-- this is really sweet.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Uh. Really, it's-- it's just,

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I don't--
I don't celebrate my birthday.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Or at least not today.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Is that, like, a...
religious thing?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I mean, I just realized
I never asked you.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Oh, It's-- it's not something
that I usually volunteer,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
but today
is not just my birthday.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
It's also
the anniversary of, um...

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
-

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
-Of course.
-It's just--

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Yeah, I'll just get all this

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
-cleared out right now.
-No.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
-Hey, happy birthday--
-Did you tell Gossip Girl

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Why would I tell
Gossip Girl anything?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I just wanted to tell you
happy birthday.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Today is not
a happy day, Julien.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
-Are you trying to fuck with me?
-What?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
No. Of course not.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Sure.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
JORDAN GLASSBERG:
They're like pinballs

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
-Clack, ding. Clack, ding.
-Pinballs I keep draining.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
You seem like
you could use an Ambien.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Or an eight-ball.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
This has become a full-time job.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
-Between the tips
from the new schools--

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
-They're still at it.
-And everyone here,

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
constantly sending me stuff
on each other.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Is that why you asked me
if second cousins was incest?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
It isn't. I hope.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
The only time I get to work
on my lesson plans

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
or grade papers
is after they go to bed.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Which is never.
And the worst thing

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
is that something great
just fell into my lap.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
A friend of mine
from The Writers' Workshop

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
is an editor
at  The Paris Review,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
and they're doing an issue
on undiscovered writers

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
and she wants me to submit.
But I-- How? When?

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
Why don't you let us help out,
take our share of the burden?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
We're all in this together,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
yet you never let us
take the wheel.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Today is Zoya's birthday!

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I mean, something is
gonna happen, I can feel it.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
She and Julien are fine.
I mean, not friends, but fine.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Besides, who would
cause drama on a birthday?

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
And this was supposed to be
our thing too. Remember?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Maybe if you let us help more,
it'll lessen your stress?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
What's more important?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Crafting posts
on privileged brats,

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
or getting published
in  The Paris Review?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
That was a trick question.
You know that, right?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
You'll let me know
if anything changes?

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
You have our word.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
-LUNA LA: Hey, Z, got a sec?
-Um...

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
I don't want to be the one
to ruin your day,

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
but in light of the fact

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
that I'm your closest
Constance confidante--

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
You definitely are not that.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Julien doesn't want you here.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
She told us she's had enough

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
of your "consistent,
disrespectful displays

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
-for attention."
-I had nothing to do

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
-with the food trucks.
-All I'm saying,

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
she might seem fine,
but she wants things

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
back the way they used to be.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
-Which means you gone.
-I doubt that's true, Luna.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Something
I'm somewhat responsible for.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
What are you talking about?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I'm sorry, okay?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I didn't know she would use it.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Use what?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
-

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
-

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
-Sorry.
-Oh, hey!

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
I was just looking
for you, actually.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
AUDREY: Me too!

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
-Who are you texting?
-Uh, my mom.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
-

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
-Who are you calling?
-MAX:  If you're leaving--

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
-My mom.
-

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
-AKI MENZIES: Bye.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
-RAFA CAPARROS: Ms. Keller.
-Mr. Caparros?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
You haven't received any tips
on Max Wolfe

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
the past few days, have you?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Relax.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
If I was gonna out
your pet project,

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I would've done it
when Black Cube was here.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Just the usual girls and boys
complaining that he's gone

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
from breadcrumbing
to outright ghosting. Why?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
He, um, owes me an essay,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
and he hasn't shown up
to class in a week.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Let me know if you
hear anything?

13:07.000 --> 13:16.000
We will.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Hey, look,
I-- I really am sorry.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I should've known better.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
You don't have to apologize.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
I mean, to be honest, I prefer
to keep my birthday low-key.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
But I still wanna celebrate you.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Maybe do a little get-together,
handful of our friends,

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
some food, music.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
Your idea of a low-key solution
is a party?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Right, okay,
we can scratch that.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
-Um. How about just dinner?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Me, you, your dad.
I'll pretend I know how to cook,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
and you guys
can watch and laugh.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
-That sounds very acceptable.
-OBIE: Call your dad and ask?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
-

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Everything okay, Z?
And if so, can I call you back?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Can't really talk right now.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Dad, what's going on?
Where are you?

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Nothing. It's just,
like, a client thing.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I can tell when you're lying.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Look, I really didn't want
to tell you this today, honey,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
but someone called in
an anonymous tip

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
to the housing board,
saying we're

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
living in Grandma's apartment
without her present.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Boom! Direct hit.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
-Let World War Z commence.
-

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
-Start composing.
-I'm already on my third line.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
If you post
Monet's tip and Kate sees it,

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
-she'll take GG back.
-WENDY: She's not gonna see it.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
Not yet, at least.
Buys us and her some time.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Okay, so...
"This just in--"

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
-Say spotted, say spotted!
-I didn't spot it.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
-GOSSIP GIRL:  Hey, followers.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
We all know
there's no such thing

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
-as a civil war.
-Hmm. That's good.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
-I'm out.
-Here, let me.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
GOSSIP GIRL:
Spies tell us a certain someone

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
has drawn her own
Mason-Dixon line...

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
-GOSSIP GIRL:

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
and her sister on the other.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
But everyone knows
a divide isn't enough.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
You have to conquer as well.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
-Whoo!
-

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Thank you.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
GOSSIP GIRL:
And there's a cannon

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
pointed in only one direction.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
-Ciao!
-GOSSIP GIRL:  What's in it?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
GOSSIP GIRL:  You'll find out
when you hear the sirens.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Take cover, my pretties.
The glitzkrieg is coming!

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
I'm so turned on right now

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
-

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
JULIEN: GG says Zoya's planning
an attack on me.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
But why?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
What could she possibly have
to use against me?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
And what've I ever done
that's so terrible?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
You were in the "Imagine" video.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And what's this thing
about drawing a line?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
She actually thinks
I'm trying to get her evicted?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
I've only been nice
to Zoya on her day.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Wished her happy birthday,
acted totally fine

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
when my ex-boyfriend
filled Fifth Avenue

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
with food trucks for her.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
This attack
is totally unwarranted.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Thing is, it doesn't matter
what you did or didn't do.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
She's clearly been waiting
to take you down.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
She must've found something
to do it with.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Come on. We've been civil.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Things have been fine
between us.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Really? Or did you
just roll over

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
and accept
her stealing your man,

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
your thunder, and your throne?
Julien, there can only be one.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I mean, how many times
did that Mary person threaten

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
to kill Queen Elizabeth before
she actually cut her head off?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
It's time for a show of force.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
You want me to murder my sister?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Only socially.
Which is much worse.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
-You're going to throw a party.
-When?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
LUNA: Tonight.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
JULIEN: On Zoya's birthday?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
LUNA: JC, you've been lucky.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
You've never had
to be on defense,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
because no one's ever stood
in your way.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
But that changed the moment
that you brought her here.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
She started taking
what was yours day one,

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
and she's not going to stop
till she has it all.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Send her back. It's time.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
How does throwing a party
stop her from using

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
-whatever she has on me?
-Julien, if your party

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
no one's gonna even hear
the sound

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
of the bomb
she's trying to explode.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Now, call your dad.
You're gonna ask him

17:09.000 --> 17:18.000
A big one.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
-OBIE: Hey!
-Did you see this?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
OBIE: Yeah, it's ridiculous.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
ZOYA:
She's trying to get us evicted,

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
and now she's throwing a party.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I can't believe she'd stoop
so low to hurt me.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Well, let's not let her,
all right?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
How about a phone-free lunch?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
And did you see
the follow-up post?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
“Special guest to be announced”?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Who's the special guest,
the exhumed corpse

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Jesus, Zoya.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
-I take-- I take it back.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
-Let's have that party.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
A big one.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
-You don't really mean that. I--
-Yes, I do.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
The only reason
I didn't want to before

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
was out of respect to our mom.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
So, if she doesn't care
about that, why should I?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Hey, where should we have it?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
-Radio City? Governors Island?
-Zoya!

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
We could have people
to your house.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
I'll figure something out,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
-I guess.
-

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Hey, Aki,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Obie's throwing me
a party tonight.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
-You should come.
-He can't.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
He's going
to Julien's party with me.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I can go to both.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
No, you cannot go to both.
You have to choose one.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
So, which party is it gonna be?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Obie's party or the girls party?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I don't have to choose.
Maybe you should choose.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Coming somewhere with me,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
or going somewhere
with someone else.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
-MONET DE HAAN: I'm so funny.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
-JULIEN: Oh, my God.
-

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
ZOYA: What just happened?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Oh, Princess Nokia
is playing Julien's party.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
You can watch it
on YouTube tomorrow.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
I guess you can too.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
She got Princess Nokia?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
How am I supposed
to compete with that?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
-You don't-- you don't have to.
-Easy for you to say.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Someone like you
can afford a war. I can't.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Who can we get
to play our party?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Uh, Rihanna?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
SZA? Kamala Harris?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
I'm gonna see you
after school, all right?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
-Hello?
-Forgive me for eavesdropping.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Sounds like
you've got a problem.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
I'm a great problem solver.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Um, no thank you,
strange child.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I'm Milo, and I'm not a child.
I'm in eighth grade.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
-Aren't you, like, seven?
-Ten.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Meet me after school?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Ew, no!

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Clearly you don't know who I am.
My last name is Sparks.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Really Ivanov,
but in this day and age,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
-it's best to leave that out.
-Yeah, I don't know who you are,

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
but I would like to end
this conversation.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Google is your friend.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Once you use it,
I will be too.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
-Max, you shouldn't be in here.
-MAX: Why not?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
-It's the school gym...
-

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
...and I go to the school.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Wow. You look like shit.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Oh, you should see
the other guys.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
You know,
I tried to reach you all week.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
I'm sure your friends did too.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Oh, I lost my phone at The Cock.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Just slid out of my hand
in the dark room and, uh...

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
You're not okay, are you?

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
That depends on where
the baseline starts.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
All this is 'cause
of what happened

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
-with your dads?
-What happened with my dads?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
You need to lay off the drugs
and deal with your shit.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
Why don't we deal
with it together?

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Oh, I am so overdressed
for this occasion.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Oh, okay,
that's how you like it?

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
-That makes sense.
-Max, stop!

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
Stop screwing around
and just fuck me already!

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I know you want to.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
If you don't,
I'll just tell everyone

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
-you did anyway.
-Are you threatening me?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I don't know.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Tell you what. Let's ask
Gossip Girl what she thinks.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Shit. I don't have my phone!

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
-Go fuck yourself, Max, okay?
-Get off me.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
-

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Heard through the grapevine
that today's your birthday.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
-You-- you read Gossip Girl?
-Guilty as charged.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
You don't seem
too happy about it.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
No, it's just been a long day
and it's only 3:00.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Do you wanna talk about it?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
It's just my sister.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
You know, since I got here,
it's been this unending battle.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
But I thought things
were getting better?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I guess you haven't been
on Instagram.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
My phone died. May I?

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
As you can see,
no more cold war.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
It's a full-on offensive.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
...there's nothing
I can really do to fight back,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
'cause I'm outmanned.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
It doesn't matter
how big your battalion is.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
It's what you do with it
that counts.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
The sad thing about this world

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
is that people like us

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
have to constantly prove
we belong.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
Honestly, I think
it could be really helpful

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
for the 99 percent of the world
to see you stand your ground.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
Thank you, Kate.
I'm really glad I know you.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
You blocked me!

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
How many pages
of your story have you written?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
You said nothing
would happen today.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
That nobody causes drama
on someone's birthday.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
-Have you watched Bravo?
-When you send me your story,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I'll unblock you.
And not a minute sooner.

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
I'm doing you a favor.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
-

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
MILO: My mom taught me early on

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
that it isn't enough
to go to war.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
-MILO: Wars never end.
-

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
MILO: What you need is a coup.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
-

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
-SHIGA: Here you go, sir.
-MILO: I told you, Shiga.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Only Hawaiian papaya.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
-We got her from Ivanka.
-

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
MILO: She's fairly new.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Uh, you were saying?
About a coup?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
MILO: Coups are the only way
to really gain control.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
-You assassinate the leader...
-

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
MILO: ...which throws everything
into chaos,

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
and during the melee,
you install yourself

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
and restore order
like the savior you are.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I'm praying
you're speaking metaphorically.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
I can be.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
What's, like, a step
or ten below that?

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
Fine. We can try what I like
to call the "Succession."

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
It's got simpler steps.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
First, you weaken the brand
you want to buy,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
making it ripe for takeover.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
No better way
to weaken an influencer

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
than to cancel them.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
Okay, but I don't wanna
make anything up or-- or lie.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
The good thing
about the internet

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Most people cancel themselves
if you dig back far enough.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
MILO:
My mom would be so mad at me

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
for taking on
something this easy.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
-What about that Dries jumpsuit

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
you wore
to the Palais de Tokyo show?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Mm-mmm. Hailey Bieber
wore it to Erewhon.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Dead to me.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
Oh! What about this one?

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
-That's cute. I love it.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
-Any progress with Ak?
-

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
AUDREY: Mm, no.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
He honestly thinks I'm the one
who has to make a choice,

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
-which makes zero sense to me.
-

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
That's weird. I just got
a bunch of cancellations

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
for tonight.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
-AUDREY:
Something about Twitter?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
-

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
What's "Calloway Cancel Party"
and why is it trending?

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
AUDREY: “There is a difference
between thick and fat people.”

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
-That tweet
did not age well.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
It gets worse.
Jameela Jamil just defended you.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
-Princess Nokia just cancelled!

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
-What?
-"There's a difference

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
between kind and cruel too."

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Zoya! Who else?

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
You really think
she'd go that far?

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
I told you she's a catalyst
of chaos. What are you gonna do?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
You cannot let her
Kim and Kanye you

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
and then get away with it.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
You're right. I'm done playing.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
This is not just her birthday.
We both lost our mom today,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
and now, we're fighting
over who knows what.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
I should be the bigger person
in all of this.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
And you know what
the bigger person does?

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
-What?
-She makes it not just

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
-If only Aki would do the same.
-Do it for him.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Princess Nokia is playing
my party tonight,

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
and you are getting an answer
from your boyfriend

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
by showing him
that you have options.

26:01.000 --> 26:10.000
And very hot ones at that.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
JULIEN:  This is a photo
of my late mother, Marion,

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
wearing her favorite dress.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
This dress and this photo

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
are my most treasured
possessions.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
She died 15 years ago today,
in childbirth--

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Tonight's party was conceived
to be a charitable affair

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
to both honor her legacy
and raise funds

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
for the Lupus Foundation
of America.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
She's using our dead mom
to get people

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
to go to her party?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Look, Julien can be selfish.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I mean, she has
her selfish moments, but...

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
that is her mom too, you know?
I mean, you ever think

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
that maybe
that's how she really feels?

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
It's a PR stunt.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
One you're falling for,
of course.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
All right, I get that
your emotions are high today,

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
but you don't have to let this
get to you, all right?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
You're Zoya.
You are cool, you are calm.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
And you don't care
about petty stuff

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
-like that.
-You don't get it, Obie.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Look, if my dad
and I get evicted,

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
we have nowhere to go.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
You know? No stockpile
of money to save us.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
And I don't know
if we can go back to Buffalo.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Why not?

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I'm not letting her
destroy this.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Milo, go to phase two.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
I'm ready to do
whatever it takes.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
-

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Please explain why
we're learning about a war

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
between our daughters
from assistants in our offices?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
-Ask Julien.
-What? Zoya started it.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Did Zoya put one of my friends
in the awkward position

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
of having to play
a party she denounced

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
because it is suddenly
for charity?

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
-Nokia's still coming?
-Yes, but that is not the point.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
And you, young lady.
I don't even know

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
-what to do with you.
-Why aren't you more mad at her?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
She's the one trying
to get us evicted.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
No, I'm not.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
NICK: I don't care
about what's going on here,

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
I just want it to end.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Between work and appealing
to the housing board,

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
this is the last thing I need.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I'm sure you feel
the same way, Davis.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Completely.
This fighting is not what

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
your mother would've wanted.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Especially not today.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Which is why
we have both decided

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
that since
it's too late to cancel,

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
this will be a joint party.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Yeah, two young women
coming together

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
to celebrate their mother.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Hey, either you do it together

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
or you don't do it at all.
It's up to you.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
-Fine.
-Fine.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I will see you tonight, Nick.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
And happy birthday, Zoya.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
NICK: I really thought we left
this kind of trouble behind

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
ZOYA: So did I.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
GOSSIP GIRL:  This just in.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
-We hear a tale...
-

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
GOSSIP GIRL:
...of two sisters may have

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
a happy ending after all.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
Word is their fathers forced

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
-a sisterly cease-fire.
-

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
GOSSIP GIRL:  But does tonight's
newly-conjoined celebration

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
signal a signed treaty,
or a Trojan Horse?

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
Time to play truce or dare.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
-

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Oh, my God.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
-She spon-conned you.
-

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
She's learning,
I'll give her that.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
Julien, we simply must get

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
-a photo together on the step...
-

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
...and repeat that your sponsors
so generously provided.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
-

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
ZOYA: Oh, and the teachers.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
-So nice of you to invite them.
-

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
-PHOTOGRAPHER 1:
Nice, now get together.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
-PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Big smile.
-PHOTOGRAPHER 3: Oh, love it.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
-Nice stunt
-Only the best for you, sis.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
Three, two, one.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
What are you counting down to?

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
-What is it?
-ZOYA: They set up a GoFundMe.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
"For our dear,
destitute classmate,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Zoya Lott's housing crisis.”
If my dad sees this,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
-he's gonna be humiliated.
-Look at me.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
It's just noise.
Don't pay attention to it.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
-You wanna go dance?
-Good thing

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
I'm already
one step ahead of her.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
-A step ahead?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
-Ugh!

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I'm being attacked
by Russian bots!

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
You're being Venmoed
for BJs, HJs, poppers, urine,

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
your celebrity fleshlight,
and "seven grams of better coke

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
-than the last batch."
-What?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
MONET:
It's not the Russian bots,

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
it's that regional bitch.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
you're scorching
her earth tonight.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
-Yeah, me too.
-

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
What's going on?
The way that you're acting is--

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
I'm not acting. I'm reacting.
And why aren't you mad at her?

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Why isn't anyone?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
God, where's Milo?
I need to find him.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Big titties, lil' waist

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
-AKI: Yo!

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
-You don't look very happy.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
You must have tried
a vegan cupcake.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
No. Zoya has,
literally overnight,

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
become somebody
I don't even recognize.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
So... I just want this night
to be over.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Seems like you do too.
What's up?

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
You have that talk
with Audrey yet?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
I'm just waiting
for the right time. Why?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
You know I'm the hottest...

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Might be the right time.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
I'm present when I'm absent

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
-What are you doing?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Aki, have you met Ravi Solis?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
He goes to Andover,
but is down for the weekend

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
to interview for an internship
at The Criterion Collection.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Akeno Menzies!
I've stalked you on Instagram.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Our mums met
at the last TEDSummit.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
It's a pleasure.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Strong grip.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Ravi, didn't you say
that your dance crew finaled

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
on  Britain's Got Talent?
Oh, I'd love to see some moves.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Aki, I trust you have
something else you've chosen

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
to occupy
your time with tonight?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Through the quarantine

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I'm starving. Thank God
my dad took care of the food.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
At least we know
it's not Pret.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
-LUNA: But it is buffet.
-I lost track of Zoya,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
which means
she's up to something.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Hey, when are you gonna give
the birthday girl

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
her birthday gift?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
-When the time is right.
-MONET: Okay, well,

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
here's our gift to you.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
We contacted
the videographer herself,

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
and turns out,
there's a director's cut.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
-Hmm.
-MONET: And unlike most of them,

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
this one's better.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
-Amazing.
-MONET: Mm-hmm.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Curvy, wavy
Big titties, lil' waist...

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
Big titties, lil' waist

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody...

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Thank you.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
The category is body

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Hey, you can head on inside.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
-GREETER: Hold on. Name.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
Uh, Max Wolfe.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
-You're not on the list.
-Cute. I am the list, okay?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
So, I'm just gonna squeeze in.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There must have been a mistake.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
-What the--
-No mistake.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
Fuck!
-I called Julien's dad...

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
-...and told him

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
since you'd most likely
be holding.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Oh, holding?
Holding?

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
-Who says “holding”?
-

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
MAX: Wanna check my breath? Huh?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
How many of these
are you on right now?

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
It's not for me, okay?
It's for inside.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I'm macro-dosing some acid.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
Okay, I'm on a Nemo,
and I'm on a Dory, and honestly,

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
right now you kinda...

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
...you kind of
look like both of them.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
-I thought your thing
was very clear boundaries.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
And here you are
with all of them broken.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
-Or is it just you
that's broken?

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
You used to be so hot. And now,
now you're just a bad trip.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Look at that.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
More than your year's salary
on the sidewalk.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
Two second rule I guess.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
-We're getting you out of here.
-Finally, some action!

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
-

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Seems like a safe space.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
May I?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
I'll join you. Seltzer?

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
You know, if you wanna go hard,
I can be your designated driver.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
I've been doing it
for seven years.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
Well, I've never really been
a "go hard" kind of guy anyway.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Also, I understand
it must've been

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
really difficult for you.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
It was essential.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
-Are you really getting evicted?
-

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
The board's trying.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Most of the units
in the building

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
have gone co-op
in the past decade.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
My mom held out,
but didn't tell anybody

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
when she was hospitalized.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
It sucks, but it's not entirely
without cause.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
We did lie about living there
without my mom.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
-How's she doing?
-Assisted living.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
-If there's ever anything
I can do to help--

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
You think
they'll behave tonight?

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
Uh...
No chance.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
You know, I can't say
we've led by great example.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
You know, I know
this is crazy, but...

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
maybe them fighting
isn't such a bad thing.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
Maybe it's Marion
giving us a chance to...

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
work our own shit out.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
I know a galaxy

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
And I can take you
For a ride

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
And most importantly,
what've you been doing?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Lying in wait, of course.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
My plan is time-released.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
What exactly is your plan?
You never told me.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
You just said to stay out
of the splash zone.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
She's halfway to wasted.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
ZOYA:
She's not drinking anything.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
She's underage.
Also, our dads are here.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
She's not drinking.
She's eating.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
An alcosynth that my friend,
Sami, is making sure to get

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
into everything
she puts into her mouth.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
Hope you don't have emetophobia,

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
because things are gonna get
pretty wet pretty soon.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
Come on, dance with me

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
OBIE: Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Do I need a retraining order?

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
-Are you drunk?
-On Dirty Lemon?

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Yeah, yeah, so much.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
I just thought that I could
appeal to you, all right?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
-Old friend to old friend.
-If you think

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
-we're old friends--
-Julien, come on.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Okay? I know you.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
This is not you, all right?

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Things between you and Zoya
were getting better,

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
-were they not?
- God, stop.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
-I already have a dad.
-She's gonna lose her home.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
I don't think that you did it,
but I know you can stop it.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
We're not gonna do this...

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
because you made your choice,

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
and now
you have to live with it.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
Which is too bad,
because in about ten minutes,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
you're gonna wish
you made a different one.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
Come on, dance with me

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Hey, can I get a, uh,

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Mint Ju-lien?

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
-Told you she would show.
-KATE KELLER:

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
It's been five minutes,

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
and I've seen ten
post-worthy things.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
Julien and Zoya are clearly
planning something big.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
And is any of it on Gossip Girl?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
No!  Guest of a Guest
has more inside info

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
-and they're not even inside.
-Jesus, Kate.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
This Gossip Girl thing
is just, uh,

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
a social experiment, right?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
It's not our lives.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
What you're supposed
to be doing at home right now,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
that's your future, your career.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
but then as soon
as the party started,

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
it's all I could think about.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Next thing I knew,
I was out the door

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
and on the train,
and now I'm here.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
-What are you so scared of?
-Maybe her story is bad.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
KATE:
If Gossip Girl reported on me,

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
you know what she'd say?

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
"Keller dropped out of Iowa,
six months shy of her MFA."

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
"Like literary,
great Hannah Horvath before her,

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
she just wasn't good enough."

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
This, I'm good at.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
This is where
I'm not just read, but heard.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
What if, in the end, Gossip Girl
is all I'm good for?

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
-You're scared.
-I am. Very. The most.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Let's go face those fears then.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
“Spotted. Wendy's got this.”

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
You know I'm with the shits

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
Girl you better quit

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Hit you with the stick

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
Didn't you say Princess Nokia
was performing?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I didn't realize that was
the main selling point for you.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
I like her.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
-Huh?
-RAVI: Don't you?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
It's okay, it's okay.
You have my consent.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
-RAVI: Okay.
-

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
RAVI: Cool.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
So, what's Aki's deal?

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
You don't have to worry
about him.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
We're open.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
He's not gay?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Wait. Are you gay?

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Why didn't you tell me?

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
I go to boarding school,
and I'm on a dance crew.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
But...

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
Look, it-- it's not like
you asked and... and I said no.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Really, I-- I just thought
he was one of us.

38:11.000 --> 38:16.000
Maybe he is. I guess
I have not asked him either.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
The chopper go echo

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
From the hood

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
AKI: Hey.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Hi.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Are you gay?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
-What?
-Are you gay?

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
It's okay.
Look, you can tell me.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I know
I'm your girlfriend,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
so it might make it difficult,
but I'm also

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
the closest person to you

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
and... I know I haven't been
the most sensitive about this.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
I've just been afraid
of the answer, I guess,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
but it's-- it's not about me.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
And I've been
making it about me.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Are you gay?

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
You know that I'm the shit

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
I don't know.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
-Julien, it's so nice
to meet you!

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
Thank you so much
for performing, Nokia.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
-I am your fannist big.
-

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Oh, baby, I love to party,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
but I want you
to drink some water, okay?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
-NOKIA: My manager told me

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
you're gonna do a speech,

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
and then you're
gonna bring me on stage?

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
-Yes, doing that right now.
-Thank you, baby.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
JULIEN: Luna?

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
MILO SPARKS:
What's got you so excited?

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Milo Sparks,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
you're not tall enough
to ride this ride.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
You owe me for that time
I gave Lily Rose Depp E. coli.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
What gives?

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Fine. Just a little
AV sitch, okay?

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
Julien's about to show the world
Zoya's true colors,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
a whole rainbow of crazy.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Give me a hint?

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
The reason Zoya
had to leave Buffalo,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
from Gossip Girl herself.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
Other side, baby

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
ZOYA: Milo, I changed--
I changed my mind.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
I didn't know you had it in you.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
-What are you talking about?
-Your sister's associates

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
have a video.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Something about why
you didn't invite

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
your old friends
from Buffalo tonight?

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
-Oh, my God. I have to stop her.
-Where have you been?

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
I can't talk right now.
Your ex-girlfriend

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
is about to ruin
my fucking life!

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Huh. Look, I thought
that a one-party solution

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
was gonna bring
you guys together,

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
but instead, you've been trying
to, like, destroy her all night.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Maybe her destroying you
is what you get in that bargain.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
So, you expect me to wave
the white flag and let her win?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Let her humiliate me

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
-in front of everybody
that I know?

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
what anybody thinks?

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Well, you didn't a month ago.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Something's changed. You've...

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
-you've changed.
It's-- You're not even--

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
-Please?

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Thank you!

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
...sis's 15th birthday,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I wanted to talk
a little bit about...

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
...the woman who really
made all of this happen.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
-Our mother...
-GUEST: Aww!

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
-...Calloway Marion.
-Oh, shit.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
JULIEN:
There's a lot Zoya and I

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
never got to learn from her,

41:04.000 --> 41:09.000
but we know, from our dads
and deep inside our hearts,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
that she was amazing.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
...like every person,
she had two sides to her.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
She was brave,
brilliant, beautiful,

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
but she wasn't always honest.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
She wasn't... always good.

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
I mean, she left
her own baby, me,

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
to run off with another man.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
Now, that reckless,
irresponsible,

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
unreliable part of my mom,
I didn't inherit,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
thankfully. But someone did.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
And now,

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
thanks to this video,
we all get to see

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
just how much of my mom
the supposedly upstanding,

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
righteous Zoya really got.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
-GIRL 1:  This school sucks!
-

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
-GIRL 2:  Oh! Oh!
Tag the chem lab! Yeah!

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
ZOYA:  This school sucks!

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
-Here comes the director's cut.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
-GIRL 2:  Okay.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Oh, come on, Emma.
This isn't funny.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
-GIRL 1:  Mother killer!
-ZOYA:  Let me out, guys.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
-This isn't funny. Let me out.
-GIRL 3:  Hey, are you

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
-Are you upset?
-GIRL 1: Hey, Bella...

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
-ZOYA:  Open the door.
-GIRL 1:  She's gonna cry.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
-GIRL 2:  Mother killer.
-GIRL 1:  What are you gonna do,

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
-ZOYA:  Let me out!
-

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Let me out!
-

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
-JULIEN: What is this?
-

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
-I didn't see this part.
-Let me out!

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Of course she goes soft.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
-What is this?
-GIRL 2 IN VIDEO:  Aww!

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
ZOYA:  This isn't funny anymore!
Let me out!

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
-Let me out!
-I didn't see this part.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
-ZOYA:  Let me out!

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
GIRL 2:  Mother killer! Killer!

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
GIRL 2:  Okay, mother killer!
GIRL 1:  Fire!

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
-Turn it off! Turn it off now!
-GIRL 2:  Oh, shit!

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
-

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
-

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
-Stop!
-

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
-What the fuck, Julien.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
-

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
Hey, everyone.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
I know that video was traumatic.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
You're probably wondering
why I played it.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I'm wondering that too.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
I hadn't seen the whole thing,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
but... that's no excuse.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
I just...
thought that she was...

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
I didn't know
she was being bullied, but...

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
I guess
when you're a bully yourself,

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
you don't see that.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Since I can't
turn back the clock,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
the very least
I can do is tell the truth.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
I'm a bully.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
And whether I do it
to your face...

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
or through your phone
without you realizing...

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
it's the same thing.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
I expect you
to want what I have,

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
but not be able to get it.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
So, if you try to,

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I'll do everything in my power
to stop you.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
And because I have
considerable power...

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
I can.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
But never again.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Take out your phones.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Do it. Hit record.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
I am a bully.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
I bully my sister.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
I bully my friends, my fans.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
And I'm never gonna do it
again, so long as I live.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
You have this video.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Dubsmash it, DeuxMoi it.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Gossip Girl it
for all it's worth.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
....how about we put
this pain behind us

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
and bow down to the Princess?

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
She's why you're all here.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Z, I love you.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
This is what your birthday
was supposed to be.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
-Nokia.
-

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
How you doing?

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Well, this is a safe space,

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
-and I don't care
what's going on in your school.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
NOKIA:
We're here to have some fun.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Yes
I'm God's favorite flavor

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
And highly favored

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
All the blessings

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
Turn to paper

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
-

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
That's stuck in honey

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
-

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
You don't have a fan for...

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
-

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
Is this the best place to talk?

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
You've been avoiding this
long enough. Here's good.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
-You've been avoiding it too.
-Avoiding what?

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
Was Max the only one,
or have you been cheating

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
-on me this whole time?
-What?

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Of course he's the only one.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
What? You really thought that...

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
No, definitely not.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Now you go.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
I'm not gay!

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
I don't-- Maybe-- Sometimes...
I think I'm into both.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
But I'm into you,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
and I love you,
and I'm attracted to you.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
I'm sorry that I slept with Max.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
-I'm not sorry I kissed him.
-

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
You said you were

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
gonna take me somewhere
to ride out my trip.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
-This is why I am tripping.
-RAFA: I called your dads.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Roy said you haven't been home
in days.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
-He's worried about you.
-Roy's only my father on paper.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
-That's not true.
-MAX: No.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
Gideon is my biological dad.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
You know, the guy that
Roy screwed over, along with me?

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
So, you getting fucked up
is supposed to, what,

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
teach him some kind of lesson?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
That you don't care?
'Cause it's obvious

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
-you care a whole lot.
-Why do you care?

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Because some of us don't have
one dad who loves us,

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
let alone two.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
I'm sorry, I-- I, uh...

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
...I didn't know.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Roy made a mistake,
but he loves you

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
and he's trying to fix it...

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
because that's what
real dads do.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
Don't push him away.
Let him in.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
He needs you right now.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Yeah, and what do you need?

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
Hmm?

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
For you to get
your shit together

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
before I find someone else
to care about.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
-

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
On some petty shit

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
So, don't try me
I'm always hungry

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
That munchie

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
-

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
-

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
-

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
-

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
-

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
-

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
-

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
-

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
Last year, my best friend
started hanging out

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
with some other kids.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Guess I was no longer cool
or something.

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
On my birthday, she told me
she was sorry,

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
to come hang out at the school.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
At first, it was fun.
They just kept daring me

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
to do stuff.
Steal a trophy, tag the walls.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I was desperate to fit in, so...

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Anyway, they were just waiting
to get me.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Bella had told them
how our mom died.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
And so, they... put me
in that room.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
And when I realized
what was happening,

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
I started to panic.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
...panic.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
And all I could think of was
to set off the fire alarm.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
You know, I don't
even think I cared

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
about if I got out of there
alive or not.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
'Cause they weren't wrong.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I killed our mom.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
She had an illness.
Lupus killed her, not you.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
No, you say that,
but you don't have to live...

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
...with knowing that
the only reason you're alive

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
is because she's dead.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
You're alive
because she wanted you to be.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
-JULIEN: Because she wanted you.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
I'm sorry I never thought about
how much pain you were in.

49:43.000 --> 49:47.000
I'm sorry for a lot of things,
and I'll always be sorry.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
Oh, well,
um, I hope you'll stop soon,

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
'cause it's really nice

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
to have somebody who knows
what I'm going through.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
That's what sisters
are for, I guess.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
-JULIEN: From now on,

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
this day is your birthday first.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
That's what
she would've wanted...

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
and that's what I want too.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
I'm glad you were born,
Zoya Jane.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Julien Elizabeth.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
It's not too late
to turn this party around.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
God, I think I really
fucked things up with Obie.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
-Can I tell you stuff like that?
-Yes. Because it's true...

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
and we don't hide
from stuff like that anymore.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Would film the way

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
It's not very sexy

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
This much

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
GOSSIP GIRL:
All right, followers.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Time to face the music.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Looks like the war
is finally over.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
I think your girlfriend
wants to dance.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go tell Luna

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
and Monet to put
their weapons down.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
You didn't leave.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
Well, how could I?
I'm dating the birthday girl.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
-For... at least another hour.
-

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
I will be very glad
when this day is behind me.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
I'm sorry
that that happened to you.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
ZOYA: I'm sorry too.
For how I treated you.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
You only wanted to make
this day special for me,

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
and I pushed you aside.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
I wasn't myself, and...

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I'm grateful that I have
someone like you

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
who knows the real me.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
-Apology accepted.
-

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
And starting now,

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
you're gonna get
the birthday you deserve.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
How about I call and get you
a suite at the Greenwich Hotel

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
-for a relaxing night alone?
-

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
Twelve-hour massage,
room service, whatever you want.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
I've never ordered room service
in my life.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Well, tonight
could be the night.

52:11.000 --> 52:16.000
Well, it won't do no good

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Thank you.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
But would you mind
if I took a rain check?

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
There's someone I really want
to spend tonight with.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
GOSSIP GIRL:  But the thing
about when wars end?

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Nobody is ever the same again.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
When the dust has settled
and the smoke clears,

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
only then can we finally face
what we've done.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
MAX: I did what you said.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
And? How'd it go?

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
He blamed me for everything.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
Like it's my fault
that their marriage fell apart,

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
it's my fault
he fell out of love.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
None of this is your fault.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
What the fuck
is wrong with me?

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
-Nothing is wrong with you.
-MAX: Yeah? Well,

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
you're probably the only person
who thinks that right now.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
You should go.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
I really should.

53:08.000 --> 53:13.000
-Max, I can't--
-Stop? Me neither.

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
-Fuck it.
-

53:19.000 --> 53:25.000
Pay them no mind

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
GOSSIP GIRL:  No one returns
from war unchanged.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
We come back strangers.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Not only to those around us,
but to ourselves.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
So, what happens now?

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
I don't know, but...
we'll figure it out together.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
GOSSIP GIRL:
And slowly, little by little,

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
we either remember
who we used to be,

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
or we allow ourselves
to become someone new.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
Hey, can I give you a ride?

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
I live, like,
60 blocks from here.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
I don't mind.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
GOSSIP GIRL:  Who will you be,

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
now that this is over?

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
GOSSIP GIRL:
I don't know about you,

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
but since it wasn't
the end of the world...

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
-I feel fine.
-

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Scratch that.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Better than fine.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Finally free.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Effortlessly yours...

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
XOXO...

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
-Gossip Girl.
