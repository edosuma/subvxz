00:07.108 --> 00:08.779
PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...

00:08.779 --> 00:11.212
Rico:
I SAW DANNY'S MOM THROW
SOMETHING INTO THE WATER.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.013
I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN A NECKLACE.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.785
IF I'M RIGHT THAT KAREN
IS COVERING FOR DANNY,

00:14.785 --> 00:16.687
THAT NECKLACE
IMPLICATES BOTH OF THEM.

00:16.687 --> 00:19.690
- WHAT, A PARTY FOR MOI?
- Archie: WHAT THE HELL'S
HE DOING HERE?

00:19.690 --> 00:21.492
EVERY PARTY
NEEDS A SOCIO, RIGHT?

00:21.492 --> 00:24.755
- THAT'S WHAT REGINA THOUGHT.
- YOU'RE AN ENIGMA,
JO MASTERSON.

00:24.755 --> 00:27.728
- AN ENIGMA I PLAN TO CRACK.
- GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.530
IT'S OBVIOUS
YOU'RE HANGING OUT
WITH THEM AGAIN.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.802
- SARITA, NO, I'M NOT.
- YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

00:31.802 --> 00:34.205
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE--
US OR THEM.

00:35.806 --> 00:38.509
- I HAVE A CRUSH ON DANNY.
- HOW COULD YOU HAVE
A CRUSH ON HIM?!

00:38.509 --> 00:40.711
- PLEASE SNAP ME OUT OF IT.
- HE KILLED HIS AUNT.

00:40.711 --> 00:43.043
- IT'S DANNY.
- WHAT ABOUT DANNY?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.346
I THINK THAT
I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM.

00:45.346 --> 00:48.048
I BROKE UP WITH HIM.
NO ONE CAN KNOW, OKAY?

00:48.048 --> 00:50.351
- EVERYTHING OKAY?
- WE FOUND IT.

STAY HERE FOR FIVE

HAVE YOU TALKED TO YOUR MOM YET?

01:27.158 --> 01:29.160
DANNY, WHAT IF SHE KNOWS
ABOUT YOUR DAD AND REGINA,

01:29.160 --> 01:30.761
OR THAT APARTMENT
IN CONNECTICUT?

01:30.761 --> 01:35.696
LACE, I EXPLAINED THIS
TO YOU AND JO. MY DAD IS
A SENSITIVE TOPIC.

01:35.696 --> 01:39.670
WE GET IT, BUT IT'S
POSSIBLE YOUR MOM KNOWS
MORE THAN SHE'S TELLING YOU.

01:39.670 --> 01:42.773
AND AT THIS POINT,
SHE SHOULDN'T BE KEEPING
ANY SECRETS.

01:42.773 --> 01:44.835
COMING FROM THE GIRL
WHO'S GOING TO MAKE ME

01:44.835 --> 01:46.607
RAPPEL OUT OF HERE
FROM A DRAINPIPE.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.880
COME ON, THIS KIND
OF SECRET IS SEXY.
WE'RE LIKE ROMEO AND JULIET.

01:49.880 --> 01:52.143
- 'CAUSE THAT ENDED WELL.
- ( laughs )

01:52.143 --> 01:55.786
CAN'T WE AT LEAST TELL JO?
I HATE KEEPING THINGS
FROM HER.

01:57.488 --> 02:00.891
ME TOO, BUT WE DON'T
WANT HER TO MAKE HER FEEL
LIKE A THIRD WHEEL, RIGHT?

02:00.891 --> 02:04.755
I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S SMARTER
TO KEEP IT PRIVATE.

02:04.755 --> 02:06.757
IF IT EVER GOT OUT--

02:06.757 --> 02:09.500
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW,
YOUR FRIENDS WOULD FREAK.

02:09.500 --> 02:12.333
EVERYONE'S STILL
ON EDGE ABOUT YOU AND I JUST
BROKE UP WITH ARCHIE.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.335
I KNOW IT SUCKS,
BUT MY FRIENDS ARE
IMPORTANT TO ME.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.767
THEY'VE GOTTEN ME
THROUGH SOME ROUGH TIMES.

02:16.767 --> 02:18.909
SOMETIMES, I FEEL LIKE

02:18.909 --> 02:22.513
PEOPLE ARE--
THEY'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE
ON EDGE ABOUT ME.

02:22.513 --> 02:24.875
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU'VE BEEN MAKING
SOME PROGRESS.

02:26.617 --> 02:28.479
TELL THAT
TO THE SOCCER TEAM.

02:28.479 --> 02:30.321
NO ONE KNOWS
WHY YOU LEFT THE TEAM.

02:30.321 --> 02:33.354
"IT GETS BETTER," RIGHT?

02:34.325 --> 02:35.856
LOOK AT YOU,

02:35.856 --> 02:38.459
QUOTING ANTIBULLYING
P.S.A.s FOR ME.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.161
- ( giggles )
- OKAY OKAY.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.564
BUT CAN I TAKE YOU
ON A DATE?

02:43.564 --> 02:45.836
A SECRET DATE--
McNALLY PARK,
TOMORROW NIGHT,

02:45.836 --> 02:46.867
YOU, ME,

02:46.867 --> 02:49.400
SHROUDED IN SEXY
SECRET DARKNESS?

02:52.643 --> 02:56.477
- FINE, BUT ONLY IF I GET YOU
FOR FIVE MORE MINUTES TONIGHT.
- ( grunts )

02:56.477 --> 02:57.478
( giggles )

03:00.651 --> 03:03.183
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DANNY
RIGHT NOW, AREN'T YOU?

03:04.755 --> 03:06.487
WHAT DID YOU GET
FOR PROBLEM FOUR?

03:06.487 --> 03:08.619
JO, YOU MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION
NOT TELLING HIM.

03:08.619 --> 03:10.921
OKAY?
IT WAS SUPER RISKY,
ON, LIKE, A MILLION LEVELS.

03:10.921 --> 03:12.793
I KNOW THAT.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.626
OKAY, SO STOP
TORTURING YOURSELF.

03:15.626 --> 03:17.868
YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:17.868 --> 03:20.631
BUT SOMETIMES
I JUST WONDER...

03:20.631 --> 03:22.903
SOME THINGS ARE
WORTH THE RISK, RIGHT?

03:22.903 --> 03:25.436
WELL, NO, N-NOT THIS.
YOU GUYS ARE FRIENDS.

03:25.436 --> 03:27.938
WHY WOULD YOU
WANNA RISK RUINING THAT
OVER SOME FEELINGS

03:27.938 --> 03:30.411
THAT MIGHT JUST GO AWAY
IF YOU JUST GIVE IT TIME

03:30.411 --> 03:34.615
AND JUST STOP
THINKING ABOUT IT, LIKE,
ALL THE TIME, EVERY DAY?

03:34.615 --> 03:37.217
AND, YOU KNOW,
YOUR DAD'S INVESTIGATING HIM

03:37.217 --> 03:39.950
AND YOU SAID IT WOULD
BE WEIRD WITH LACEY.

03:39.950 --> 03:43.494
I KNOW, IT MIGHT RUIN
THAT WHOLE NEW DYNAMIC.

03:44.755 --> 03:46.897
DANNY MIGHT NOT EVEN
SEE ME THAT WAY, YOU KNOW?

03:46.897 --> 03:48.929
WHAT?
NO, THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.561
YOU'RE A CATCH.

03:50.561 --> 03:53.003
YOU'RE SMART,
YOU'RE FUNNY, YOU'RE PRETTY.

03:54.665 --> 03:56.367
YOU'RE THE TOTAL PACKAGE.

03:56.367 --> 03:58.509
LIKE, OBJECTIVELY,
I-- I MEAN,

03:58.509 --> 04:00.311
AS LIKE AN OBSERVER OF...

04:00.311 --> 04:03.444
YOU KNOW... PACKAGES.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.876
OKAY, THAT--
OKAY, THAT SOUNDED WEIRD.

04:05.876 --> 04:08.018
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
- YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

04:09.019 --> 04:10.020
THANKS.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.855
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE I AM SELLING
MYSELF SHORT.

04:19.790 --> 04:21.662
- ( clicking )
- WAIT, WHAT'S, UM--

04:21.662 --> 04:23.594
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- I'M GONNA TEXT DANNY

04:23.594 --> 04:25.296
AND TELL HIM WE NEED
TO TALK TOMORROW.

04:25.296 --> 04:26.997
WAIT, JO, THAT--
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

04:26.997 --> 04:29.900
I'LL NEVER GET PAST THIS
UNLESS I JUST TELL HIM HOW
I FEEL, YOU KNOW?

04:29.900 --> 04:32.473
JUST PUT IT OUT THERE,
SEE IF HE FEELS THE SAME WAY.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.949
JO--

04:38.949 --> 04:40.451
YEAH?

04:40.451 --> 04:42.953
UH...

04:42.953 --> 04:44.715
NOTHING.
I HOPE HE LIKES YOU BACK.

04:48.819 --> 04:50.691
OKAY, SENT.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.563
( groans )

04:54.325 --> 04:56.367
NOW WHAT DID YOU GET
FOR PROBLEM FOUR?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.732
MORNING.

05:01.732 --> 05:02.973
MORNING.

05:02.973 --> 05:05.305
GETTING INTO THE OFFICE
EARLY, I SEE.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.937
YEAH, THEY'RE STILL
TRAINING ME.

05:06.937 --> 05:09.680
REAL ESTATE'S MORE COMPLICATED
THAN IT LOOKS,

05:09.680 --> 05:10.911
BUT I'M EXCITED.

05:13.644 --> 05:15.646
CAN I DISCUSS SOMETHING
WITH YOU?

05:15.646 --> 05:19.450
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT HOW REGINA CRANE
GOT AHOLD OF THAT NECKLACE?

05:21.422 --> 05:23.954
NOT REALLY. WHO KNOWS?

05:23.954 --> 05:27.428
I MEAN, SOMEONE MUST'VE
GIVEN IT TO HER, SOMEBODY
WITH ACCESS TO IT.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.460
COULD IT HAVE BEEN DAD?

05:29.460 --> 05:31.061
NO.

05:31.061 --> 05:34.334
HE WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
IT MEANT TOO MUCH TO HIM.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.867
BESIDES HE DIDN'T HAVE IT.

05:36.867 --> 05:38.709
REALLY? WHO DID?

05:38.709 --> 05:40.441
I HAVE NO IDEA.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.042
HE TRIED TO CLAIM IT
AFTER TARA...

05:45.015 --> 05:46.977
THE ESTATE LAWYER
COULDN'T FIND IT,

05:46.977 --> 05:49.450
SO THEY HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.583
- AND THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD YOU?
- YOU THINK HE'D LIE TO ME
ABOUT IT?

05:52.583 --> 05:54.525
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S JUST ODD.

05:55.886 --> 05:57.528
DID DAD KNOW HER?
REGINA?

05:57.528 --> 05:59.990
- DID THEY EVER MEET?
- WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

05:59.990 --> 06:02.793
I'M NOT SUGGESTING ANYTHING.
I'M JUST ASKING QUESTIONS.

06:02.793 --> 06:04.795
BEFORE HIS ACCIDENT,

06:04.795 --> 06:07.798
COULD HE HAVE BEEN
SEEING SOMEONE ELSE?

06:07.798 --> 06:09.840
I KNOW THINGS WERE ROUGH
FOR YOU GUYS--

06:09.840 --> 06:11.842
DANNY, STOP IT,
PLEASE, OKAY?

06:11.842 --> 06:14.805
I MEAN, YOUR FATHER WAS
A COMPLEX MAN, BUT WHAT
YOU'RE IMPLYING IS DISGUSTING!

06:18.509 --> 06:20.811
LET'S NOT FOCUS
ON THE PAST, OKAY?

06:28.719 --> 06:30.921
( door opens, shouts )

06:40.000 --> 06:41.902
( theme music playing )

06:47.508 --> 06:48.979
( chattering )

06:48.979 --> 06:52.983
YOU GUYS! SCOTT SAYS HE MISSES
ME SO MUCH THAT HIS HEART HURTS!

06:52.983 --> 06:55.045
MAYBE HE ATE
A BAD BURRITO.

06:55.045 --> 06:57.548
HE ALSO SAID THAT ARCHIE'S
HANGING IN THERE.

06:57.548 --> 06:59.990
AN AWAY TOURNAMENT IS PROBABLY
THE BEST THING FOR HIM
RIGHT NOW.

06:59.990 --> 07:01.722
YEAH, I'M GLAD
HE HAS THE TEAM.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.625
I STILL DON'T SEE WHY
YOU BROKE UP WITH HIM.
THAT ASS NEVER QUIT.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.728
THERE'S MORE TO RELATIONSHIPS
THAN ASSES, SARITA.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.160
- LIKE?
- IT'S NOT AS THOUGH
IT WAS AN EASY DECISION.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.863
I CARE ABOUT HIM, BUT IT
JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.

07:12.863 --> 07:15.005
- ( phone chimes )
- IT'S HIM.

07:15.005 --> 07:17.838
PUMPKIN?
MY LITTLE PUMPKIN!

07:17.838 --> 07:20.641
I SO DIDN'T SEE
THAT MATCH-UP COMING.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.914
WOW, SHE IS A LOT TO TAKE.
TONE IT DOWN, AM I RIGHT?

07:23.914 --> 07:25.616
- ( phone vibrates )
-

07:25.616 --> 07:27.848
LOOKS LIKE THE SOCIO HAD
AN INTERESTING MORNING.

07:27.848 --> 07:31.451
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- SOMEONE PLAYED A LITTLE PRANK
ON HIS HOUSE.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.584
CHECK IT OUT.

07:34.885 --> 07:36.957
OH MY GOD, THAT'S AWFUL.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.460
- WHO WOULD DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
- SYMPATHY FOR THE PSYCHO?

07:40.460 --> 07:43.934
EXCUSE ME FOR NOT
WANTING TO BE REMINDED
OF THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE.

07:46.236 --> 07:47.998
RIGHT. SORRY, LACE.

07:47.998 --> 07:49.740
IT'S OKAY. I GOTTA RUN.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.647
- THIS IS SO SICK.
- I SPENT THE MORNING
CLEANING THEM UP,

07:56.647 --> 07:58.849
BUT I GUESS
I COULDN'T KEEP AWAY
THE AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHERS.

07:58.849 --> 08:01.912
- GOD, I HATE THIS TOWN
SOMETIMES.
- IT'S OVER.

08:01.912 --> 08:04.254
NOT EVEN WORTH ANOTHER THOUGHT.
LET'S JUST FORGET IT.

08:04.254 --> 08:08.258
SO WHAT WAS THE DEAL
WITH YOUR TEXT LAST NIGHT?

08:08.258 --> 08:10.921
SOMETHING YOU WANTED
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

08:10.921 --> 08:12.793
YEAH, I...

08:13.824 --> 08:15.065
DANNY, BUDDY!

08:16.266 --> 08:18.669
I SAW THAT WHOLE
JUMP-ROPE THING.

08:18.669 --> 08:20.130
YIKES, WHAT A BUMMER.

08:20.130 --> 08:22.603
YEAH WELL, THANKS, TYLER.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.035
- IT IS WHAT IT IS.
- "IT IS WHAT IT IS."

08:25.035 --> 08:28.108
I LOVE THAT.
OKAY, I'VE BEEN AVOIDING
BOTHERING YOU ABOUT THIS,

08:28.108 --> 08:31.682
BUT IS THERE ANY CHANCE
YOU'D LET ME INTERVIEW YOU
FOR MY DOCUMENTARY?

08:31.682 --> 08:34.945
- A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT WHAT?
- THE SCHOOL, THE TOWN,

08:34.945 --> 08:37.117
HOW EVERYONE IS DEALING
WITH YOU COMING BACK,

08:37.117 --> 08:38.849
THE FEAR, THE EMOTION.

08:39.850 --> 08:41.952
I SWEAR IT'S NOT
A SMEAR PIECE.

08:41.952 --> 08:43.954
I JUST WANNA
TALK TO YOU, DANNY,

08:43.954 --> 08:45.926
GET YOUR SIDE
OF THE STORY, YOU KNOW?

08:45.926 --> 08:49.299
THANKS, BUT I'D KINDA RATHER
NOT DRAW ANY MORE ATTENTION
TO MYSELF.

08:49.299 --> 08:51.161
SUIT YOURSELF.

08:51.161 --> 08:53.263
BUT IT SEEMS
LIKE ATTENTION IS
FOLLOWING YOU.

08:53.263 --> 08:55.906
MIGHT AS WELL SPIN IT
IN YOUR FAVOR.

08:55.906 --> 08:57.107
HOW ABOUT YOU, JO?

08:57.107 --> 08:59.910
WOULD YOU WANNA DO
AN INTERVIEW WITH ME?

08:59.910 --> 09:01.912
I'M GOOD, TYLER,
THANKS.

09:01.912 --> 09:04.645
OKAY, HOW ABOUT
WE GRAB DINNER THEN?

09:04.645 --> 09:06.617
YOU AND ME, I'M BUYING.

09:07.678 --> 09:09.279
UM...

09:11.151 --> 09:13.553
OOH, I JUST
STEPPED IN IT, HUH?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.225
YOU TWO HOOKING UP
OR SOMETHING?

09:15.225 --> 09:17.888
- HEH.
- WHAT, ME AND JO? NO.

09:17.888 --> 09:19.790
SHE'S LIKE--
SHE'S LIKE MY SISTER.

09:19.790 --> 09:22.092
OH OKAY.

09:22.092 --> 09:23.894
THEN WHAT DO YOU SAY, JO?

09:23.894 --> 09:26.136
WANNA GRAB A BITE
SOMETIME?

09:26.136 --> 09:27.868
NO CAMERAS--
UNLESS YOU WANT.

09:28.939 --> 09:30.871
UM...

09:30.871 --> 09:32.973
NO THANKS, TYLER.
I'M GOOD.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.905
OKAY.

09:34.905 --> 09:37.177
FIND ME IF YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.909
YOU TOO, DANNY,

09:38.909 --> 09:41.852
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND
ABOUT THAT INTERVIEW.

09:41.852 --> 09:43.714
IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU.

09:45.355 --> 09:47.788
( chuckles )
WOW, HE'S--

09:47.788 --> 09:49.760
HE'S SUBTLE, ISN'T HE?

09:51.191 --> 09:53.624
SO WAIT,
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU WANTED
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

09:53.624 --> 09:55.696
HMM? NOTHING,
IT'S NOTHING.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.367
I ACTUALLY HAVE
TO GO AND MEET RICO,
SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER,

10:00.370 --> 10:02.032
YEAH OKAY!

10:05.876 --> 10:07.678
CHIEF, YOU ALL RIGHT?

10:07.678 --> 10:09.309
YEAH, EDDIE.
JUST THINKING.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.012
ABOUT HOW WE'VE
HAD THAT NECKLACE IN OUR
POSSESSION FOR THREE DAYS

10:12.012 --> 10:13.844
AND HAVEN'T DONE
A THING ABOUT IT?

10:13.844 --> 10:15.716
JUST SAYING.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.989
I DON'T WANT TO PUT
PRESSURE ON KAREN NOW.
SHE JUST STARTED A NEW JOB.

10:18.989 --> 10:21.952
WASN'T THE PURPOSE
OF GETTING HER THAT JOB
TO BUTTER HER UP?

10:21.952 --> 10:24.054
LOOK, IF YOUR THEORY'S
RIGHT

10:24.054 --> 10:25.996
AND SHE'S COVERING
FOR HER KID,

10:25.996 --> 10:28.628
THEN IT'S POSSIBLE
SHE'S AN ACCESSORY
TO MURDER.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.360
AT THE VERY LEAST,
SHE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.803
DID YOU RUN MORE TESTS
ON THE PAINT SAMPLE
FROM THE HEAD WOUND?

10:32.803 --> 10:34.935
YEAH, NO NEW LEADS.

10:34.935 --> 10:38.238
IT'S STANDARD INDUSTRIAL
WHITE PAINT, USED ON
ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.410
WE CAN'T BEGIN
TO DETERMINE WHAT,
SINCE THERE'S--

10:40.410 --> 10:43.944
THERE'S NOTHING MISSING
FROM THE CRANE RESIDENCE.
I KNOW.

10:43.944 --> 10:48.048
- EXCEPT THAT NECKLACE.
- OKAY OKAY. I'M HAVING
COFFEE WITH KAREN TONIGHT.

10:48.048 --> 10:51.021
- I'LL WORK ON HER AND SEE
IF I CAN GET HER TO TALK.
- COFFEE?

10:51.021 --> 10:53.153
YOU'RE GETTING SOFT
IN YOUR OLD AGE.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.225
MIDDLE AGE, YOU ASS.

10:55.225 --> 10:57.327
NOW GET OUT OF MY OFFICE.

10:57.327 --> 10:59.259
YES SIR.

11:04.394 --> 11:08.839
- WOW, IT'S APPLE CIDER.
- IT'S SPARKLING APPLE CIDER.

11:08.839 --> 11:10.801
- ACTUALLY.
- ( giggles )

11:10.801 --> 11:12.442
GOD, YOU'RE
A DEMANDING DATE.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.777
WE GONNA TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED AT YOUR HOUSE
THIS MORNING?

11:16.777 --> 11:18.779
WHAT'S THERE
TO TALK ABOUT?

11:18.779 --> 11:21.952
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BROUGHT
IT UP. ARE YOU OKAY?

11:21.952 --> 11:23.253
I'M GREAT.

11:23.253 --> 11:25.085
I'M GREAT NOW THAT
I'M HERE WITH YOU.

11:29.159 --> 11:32.963
- ( romantic music playing )
- MMM, SUBTLE.

11:32.963 --> 11:35.826
I THOUGHT SO.
I ACTUALLY JUST LOOKED UP

11:35.826 --> 11:38.929
"SEXY DATE MUSIC" ONLINE,
IT'S THE FIRST THING
THAT CAME UP.

11:38.929 --> 11:41.932
DO YOU WANT SOME MORE
QUOTE-UNQUOTE CHAMPAGNE,
MADAME?

11:43.804 --> 11:45.135
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY...

11:45.135 --> 11:47.177
IF YOU EVER WANNA
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT--

11:47.177 --> 11:49.780
IT'S FINE.
ARE YOU FINE?

11:49.780 --> 11:53.143
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST-- I MEAN...

11:53.143 --> 11:55.445
SEEING THOSE PHOTOS,
IT MUST'VE BEEN HARD.

11:55.445 --> 11:57.287
NO, IT WASN'T.

11:57.287 --> 11:59.189
( sighs )
YOU'RE RIGHT,

11:59.189 --> 12:01.822
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT
ALL THIS STUFF.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.195
I'M GLAD I'M HERE.

12:05.195 --> 12:06.897
ME TOO.

12:06.897 --> 12:09.059
♪ Falling in love
with you... ♪

12:14.434 --> 12:16.106
- ( branch snaps )
- ( Lacey gasps )

12:16.106 --> 12:18.438
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:21.471 --> 12:24.274
HELLO!
WHO'S THERE?

12:28.779 --> 12:30.951
OH MY GOD.
IS HE SUPPOSED TO BE YOU?

12:30.951 --> 12:32.052
I-I THINK SO.

12:34.324 --> 12:35.826
IT'S FUNNY.
I GET IT.

12:35.826 --> 12:37.757
IT'S HILARIOUS.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ME.

12:41.531 --> 12:43.263
- DANNY!
- OKAY.

12:51.241 --> 12:54.945
GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE! GO!

12:54.945 --> 12:56.406
( shatters )

12:59.249 --> 13:00.410
( sobs )

13:08.418 --> 13:10.490
( liquid pours )

13:10.490 --> 13:12.362
HOW'S THE FISH?

13:12.362 --> 13:14.494
GREAT.

13:14.494 --> 13:17.497
YOUR FATHER CALLED.
HE'S UPSET HE COULDN'T
BE HOME FOR DINNER AGAIN.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.069
SOMETHING CAME UP AT WORK.

13:21.071 --> 13:23.403
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH DANNY.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.375
NEVER SAID IT DID.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.907
WHAT?

13:26.907 --> 13:28.308
NOTHING.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.381
YOU'VE JUST BEEN
IN SUCH A BAD MOOD
EVER SINCE YOU GOT HOME.

13:33.043 --> 13:35.886
IS IT ABOUT WHAT
YOU TOLD ME THE OTHER NIGHT?

13:35.886 --> 13:38.088
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
FOR DANNY?

13:38.088 --> 13:40.420
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.452
HE DOESN'T FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME.

13:45.595 --> 13:48.328
SO YOU TALKED
TO HIM ABOUT IT?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.901
NO, I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

13:50.901 --> 13:53.363
HE TOLD SOMEONE
I WAS LIKE HIS SISTER.

13:53.363 --> 13:55.605
UNLESS WE'VE TIME TRAVELED
BACK TO THE MIDDLE AGES,

13:55.605 --> 13:58.338
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT RULES OUT
ANYTHING EVER HAPPENING.

13:59.609 --> 14:02.012
- ( sighs )
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACT UPSET,

14:02.012 --> 14:04.044
I KNOW YOU HATED THE IDEA
OF ME AND DANNY.

14:04.044 --> 14:08.018
I DIDN'T HATE THE IDEA.
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
COMPLICATED.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.422
IT MAY HURT RIGHT NOW,
HONEY, BUT...

14:12.422 --> 14:14.324
IT'LL WORK OUT, TRUST ME.

14:14.324 --> 14:16.056
IT'S FINE.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.288
I WAS AN IDIOT
TO LET MYSELF GET
SO CARRIED AWAY.

14:18.288 --> 14:20.430
NO, YOU WEREN'T.

14:20.430 --> 14:22.292
I LOVE SEEING
THIS SIDE OF YOU.

14:22.292 --> 14:24.434
THIS OPENNESS,
THIS SPARK.

14:24.434 --> 14:28.338
DON'T LET THAT GO OUT
JUST BECAUSE IT DIDN'T
WORK OUT WITH DANNY.

14:28.338 --> 14:30.240
THERE ARE OTHER CUTE BOYS.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.443
YOU MEAN...

14:33.443 --> 14:35.045
OTHER FISH IN THE SEA?

14:35.045 --> 14:37.307
YOU SAID IT, NOT ME.

14:42.052 --> 14:44.084
I CAN HAVE A CAR STATIONED
OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE,

14:44.084 --> 14:45.615
IF SOMEONE TRIES
A STUNT LIKE THAT AGAIN.

14:45.615 --> 14:48.318
I'M SURE IT WAS BORED KIDS.

14:48.318 --> 14:50.120
I JUST FEEL BAD FOR DANNY.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.662
HE WAS ALREADY BUMMED OUT
ABOUT HAVING TO LEAVE THE
SOCCER TEAM

14:52.662 --> 14:55.295
- AND NOW THIS.
- WHY'D HE QUIT THE TEAM?

14:55.295 --> 14:57.527
HE SAID HE WAS
STRUGGLING TO FIT IN.

14:57.527 --> 15:00.370
- SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
- YEAH, WELL...

15:00.370 --> 15:03.433
THANKS.
OH, AND THANKS AGAIN
FOR CALLING RAY BICKNER.

15:03.433 --> 15:06.606
IT WAS ONE PHONE CALL.
HOW IS RAY?

15:06.606 --> 15:09.609
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT.
HE'S DEFINITELY FRIENDLY,

15:09.609 --> 15:12.182
- BUT HE'S HARMLESS.
- YOU SURE?

15:12.182 --> 15:14.444
'CAUSE I CAN HAVE
A CAR STATIONED OUTSIDE
YOUR WORK TOO.

15:14.444 --> 15:16.386
( chuckling )

15:16.386 --> 15:18.118
OH, I MEANT TO TELL YOU--

15:18.118 --> 15:20.650
TESS GOT SOME GREAT PHOTOS
OF THE KIDS DANCING
AT FALL FEST.

15:20.650 --> 15:22.922
OH REALLY?
I'D LOVE TO SEE THEM.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.624
- I HEARD THEY HAD
A GREAT TIME.
- THEY DID.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.997
HOW ABOUT YOU?
DID YOU HAVE FUN
AT THE FESTIVAL?

15:26.997 --> 15:29.499
NO, I DECIDED
TO STAY IN THAT NIGHT.

15:29.499 --> 15:31.331
YOU KNOW, TIRED.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.364
YOU SURE?

15:34.364 --> 15:37.367
'CAUSE I COULD'VE
SWORN I SAW YOU WALKING
INTO McNALLY PARK.

15:37.367 --> 15:40.370
IT MUST'VE BEEN
SOMEONE ELSE.

15:40.370 --> 15:42.042
I DON'T THINK SO.

15:42.042 --> 15:45.415
IF THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU WANNA TELL ME, KAREN,
NOW'S THE TIME.

15:47.417 --> 15:49.579
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.
I THOUGHT YOU'D CHANGED,

15:49.579 --> 15:52.322
- THAT YOU ACTUALLY
WANTED TO HELP ME.
- I AM HELPING YOU.

15:52.322 --> 15:55.355
I'M GIVING YOU
AN OPPORTUNITY
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH.

15:56.486 --> 15:58.288
THANKS FOR THE COFFEE.

15:58.288 --> 16:00.630
YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY
FROM THIS, KAREN.

16:00.630 --> 16:04.294
EITHER WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT HERE
OR AT MY OFFICE TOMORROW.
IT'S UP TO YOU.

16:04.294 --> 16:06.466
THEN I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW...
WITH MY LAWYER.

16:24.314 --> 16:26.556
I CAN'T REALLY TALK RIGHT NOW,
I'M LATE FOR ENGLISH.

16:26.556 --> 16:30.290
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOU WERE HOLDING UP
AFTER LAST NIGHT.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.722
- STILL KINDA FREAKED. YOU?
- OKAY.

16:32.722 --> 16:35.425
A BIT OFFENDED BY THE MASKS.
I THINK MY HAIR IS
NICER THAN THAT.

16:36.626 --> 16:38.728
I'M SORRY, SORRY.

16:40.170 --> 16:42.432
- LAST NIGHT WASN'T FUNNY.
- NO, IT WAS SCARY.

16:42.432 --> 16:45.435
THOSE GUYS IN THE MASKS
OBVIOUSLY FOLLOWED US.

16:45.435 --> 16:47.777
WHO COULD BE DOING
ALL OF THIS TO YOU?

16:47.777 --> 16:50.680
I'D SAY IT WAS YOUR BITTER EX,
BUT HE'S AWAY AT A SOCCER
TOURNAMENT, RIGHT?

16:50.680 --> 16:51.681
( locker slams )

16:51.681 --> 16:55.115
HEY, LACEY, CALM DOWN.
IT'S OKAY.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.447
NO ONE CAN SEE US IN HERE.

16:57.447 --> 17:00.320
- OUR SECRET IS SAFE.
- IS IT?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.292
WHO KNOWS WHAT
THOSE CREEPS LAST NIGHT SAW.

17:02.292 --> 17:04.524
- HALF THE SCHOOL MIGHT
KNOW ABOUT US BY NOW.
- I DOUBT IT.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.756
BUT NEXT TIME
WE'LL BE MORE CAREFUL.

17:06.756 --> 17:08.798
NEXT TIME? DANNY,

17:08.798 --> 17:11.401
I THINK WE MIGHT WANNA
LAY LOW FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

17:13.403 --> 17:15.505
I HATE BEING THIS PERSON
THAT YOU HAVE TO HIDE.

17:15.505 --> 17:18.338
- AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO CHANGE IT.
- MAYBE YOU CAN'T RIGHT NOW.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.670
MAYBE IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE MORE TIME

17:20.670 --> 17:22.542
FOR PEOPLE
TO GET OVER IT--

17:22.542 --> 17:25.315
YOU BEING BACK,
YOUR PAST.

17:25.315 --> 17:28.047
YEAH. I GUESS.

17:29.319 --> 17:30.580
I HAVE TO GO TO CLASS.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.358
SO HE CALLED YOU
HIS SISTER.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.330
AT LEAST HE DIDN'T SAY,
LIKE, "SHE'S MY COUSIN,"

17:40.330 --> 17:42.232
OR "SHE'S LIKE
A DISTANT NIECE."

17:42.232 --> 17:44.434
I'M SO REGRETTING
TELLING YOU THAT NOW.

17:47.097 --> 17:49.369
HEY, THERE'S ANOTHER GUY
OUT THERE FOR YOU.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.441
I KNOW IT.

17:51.441 --> 17:53.443
A GREAT GUY.

18:03.353 --> 18:05.515
- YOU OKAY?
- HMM?

18:05.515 --> 18:08.318
YEAH, JUST NOT
MY BEST DAY EVER.

18:18.228 --> 18:21.501
- WHAT?
- I STILL DON'T GET WHY YOU
JUST DON'T GO FOR IT WITH HIM.

18:21.501 --> 18:24.474
WHO-- WHO ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

18:26.206 --> 18:27.637
( laughs )

18:29.509 --> 18:32.482
HIM? TYLER LEWIS?

18:32.482 --> 18:34.344
WHY WOULD JO "GO FOR IT"
WITH TYLER LEWIS?

18:34.344 --> 18:36.486
HE ASKED HER OUT
YESTERDAY.

18:36.486 --> 18:39.189
JO SHOT HIM DOWN.
IT WAS VERY HARSH.

18:39.189 --> 18:42.422
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.357
WOW.
LOOK AT HER GO.

18:47.357 --> 18:48.898
EXCUSE ME,
I'M TRYING TO STUDY.

18:48.898 --> 18:51.261
AHEM.

18:52.362 --> 18:55.335
JO MASTERSON.
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

18:55.335 --> 18:57.267
I'M GOOD,
IT'S GOOD.

18:57.267 --> 18:59.539
CAN I TALK TO YOU ALONE
FOR A SECOND?

18:59.539 --> 19:02.212
YEAH YEAH.
GUYS, PLEASE.

19:06.676 --> 19:08.578
SO YOU REMEMBER
YESTERDAY, RIGHT?

19:08.578 --> 19:10.850
THURSDAY.
SURE, WHAT ABOUT IT?

19:10.850 --> 19:13.353
DINNER?
WE TALKED ABOUT DINNER?

19:13.353 --> 19:15.355
WE DID?

19:15.355 --> 19:17.657
ARE-ARE-- ARE YOU
SURE THAT WAS ME?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.429
UHHH...

19:19.429 --> 19:22.192
JO, JO, I'M KIDDING.
HOW COULD I EVER FORGET?

19:22.192 --> 19:25.495
YOU BRUTALIZED ME
WITH YOUR COLD,
HARD REJECTION.

19:25.495 --> 19:28.167
I ASSUME
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND?

19:31.501 --> 19:33.443
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T TRUST THAT GUY.

19:33.443 --> 19:36.506
- HUH?
- I DON'T TRUST THAT GUY
WITH HIS GLOWING SKIN,

19:36.506 --> 19:39.449
AND, LIKE, SMILING
A LOT AND STUFF.

19:40.450 --> 19:42.912
HE'S ALL TAN AND TOOTHY,

19:42.912 --> 19:44.514
LIKE A SHARK.

19:44.514 --> 19:46.616
ARE SHARKS TAN?

19:46.616 --> 19:48.918
BY THE WAY, I DON'T THINK
HE'S THAT BAD A GUY.

19:48.918 --> 19:51.361
HE'S ALL, LIKE, MR. POPULAR,
LIKE, RUNNING CLUBS,

19:51.361 --> 19:53.423
STRUTTING AROUND SCHOOL,
THROWING BIG, DUMB PARTIES.

19:53.423 --> 19:56.496
HE'S JUST ONE
OF THOSE CHEESY GUYS
THAT GIRLS ALWAYS GO FOR.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.968
- AHEM.
- HEY, RICO,

19:58.968 --> 20:01.331
- YOU HAVE PLANS TONIGHT?
- PLANS? NO.

20:01.331 --> 20:03.303
- WHY?
- YOU'RE INVITED.

20:04.434 --> 20:06.276
TO THE PARTY I'M THROWING.

20:13.983 --> 20:16.215
DANNY, BUDDY,
WHAT'S UP?

20:16.215 --> 20:19.519
NOT TOO MUCH.
JO TOLD ME YOU TWO
ARE GOING OUT TONIGHT.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.252
YEAH, I'M PSYCHED.
SHE'S A CUTE ONE.

20:22.252 --> 20:23.953
SHE'S EXTREMELY SPECIAL.

20:23.953 --> 20:26.926
ARE YOU HERE TO GIVE ME
THE "BIG BRO" TALK?

20:26.926 --> 20:28.828
THREATEN TO KILL ME
IF I HURT HER?

20:28.828 --> 20:30.530
I'D BELIEVE IT,
COMING FROM YOU.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.463
ACTUALLY
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT LATER ON TONIGHT.

20:33.463 --> 20:34.904
I'M THINKING ABOUT
THROWING A PARTY

20:34.904 --> 20:38.308
AT MY HOUSE WITH FOOD
AND DRINKS AND, YOU KNOW...

20:38.308 --> 20:39.839
PEOPLE.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.911
THE LIFEBLOOD
OF ANY GOOD PARTY.

20:41.911 --> 20:43.973
LOOK, DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY, BUDDY,

20:43.973 --> 20:45.715
BUT THESE
HYPOTHETICAL "PEOPLE"

20:45.715 --> 20:48.878
MIGHT BE HYPOTHETICALLY FREAKED
TO GO TO A PARTY AT YOUR HOUSE,

20:48.878 --> 20:50.780
YOU KNOW,
WHERE STUFF HAPPENED.

20:50.780 --> 20:54.354
YEAH, I KNOW IT'S
A BIT OF A TOUGH SELL.
BUT THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.556
EVERYONE HERE LOVES YOU.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.889
AND YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO TOLD ME TO EMBRACE
THE ATTENTION,

20:59.889 --> 21:02.392
SPIN IT IN MY FAVOR.
AND I CAN'T DO THAT
WITHOUT SOME HELP.

21:02.392 --> 21:05.595
OKAY, I'LL DO IT YOU
IF YOU LET ME INTERVIEW YOU
FOR MY FILM.

21:05.595 --> 21:08.267
AND I WANNA FILM
THE ENTIRE PARTY.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.900
KNOWN KILLER TRIES
TO WIN OVER THE MASSES
WITH PRETZELS AND BEER?

21:10.900 --> 21:12.772
YOU COULDN'T
WRITE IT BETTER.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.645
FINE.
ONE INTERVIEW.

21:15.645 --> 21:16.846
PERFECT.

21:20.910 --> 21:23.783
- Kyle: LET'S GO
OVER THIS AGAIN.
- Man: CHIEF MASTERSON, ENOUGH.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.756
MY CLIENT HAS
STATED ON THE RECORD
THAT SHE WAS HOME.

21:26.756 --> 21:30.490
IT'S YOUR WORD AGAINST
HERS THAT YOU SAW HER ENTER
McNALLY PARK THAT NIGHT.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.822
NOW ARE YOU GONNA
LET MRS. DESAI GO

21:32.822 --> 21:35.765
OR ARE YOU GONNA
TELL US WHAT THE HELL
THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

21:35.765 --> 21:38.928
PLEASE, KAREN, LAST CHANCE.

21:38.928 --> 21:41.431
I KNOW YOU WERE
IN THAT PARK.

21:41.431 --> 21:44.774
KYLE, I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU MUST'VE SEEN
SOMEONE ELSE.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.077
THE PROBLEM IS I'M NOT
THE ONE WHO SAW YOU.

21:48.077 --> 21:51.481
- I HAVE AN ACTUAL WITNESS--
- ( scoffs ) A WITNESS!

21:51.481 --> 21:53.643
SO NOW WE HAVE
A FICTIONAL WITNESS.

21:53.643 --> 21:56.546
THIS WITNESS SAW YOU WALK OUT
ONTO THE DOCK

21:56.546 --> 21:58.047
AND THROW SOMETHING
INTO THE POND.

21:58.047 --> 22:01.891
WE SEARCHED THE POND
NEAR THE DOCK AND FOUND THIS.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.425
THIS NECKLACE IS WHAT?

22:05.425 --> 22:07.727
THE ITEM MISSING
FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

22:12.662 --> 22:15.765
THANK YOU, CHIEF MASTERSON.
I NEED TIME TO CONSULT
WITH MY CLIENT.

22:17.437 --> 22:18.838
( door opens )

22:19.839 --> 22:21.941
- TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED.
- ( door closes )

22:23.443 --> 22:25.615
TONIGHT IS JUST GONNA,
LIKE, MAKE THE MOVIE.

22:25.615 --> 22:28.878
I MEAN, THE DRAMA,
THE REDEMPTION ARC
OF IT ALL, YOU KNOW?

22:28.878 --> 22:31.621
PLUS CRAZY STUFF ALWAYS
HAPPENS AT PARTIES.

22:31.621 --> 22:35.124
( laughs )
I'M SURE IT'LL BE
A WILD RIDE.

22:35.124 --> 22:37.857
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THE GAME PLAN?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.989
GOING TO THE PARTY AFTER?

22:39.989 --> 22:42.091
I MEAN, DANNY IS
YOUR FRIEND.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.765
YEAH, HE IS DEFINITELY
MY FRIEND.

22:46.896 --> 22:48.738
WHAT'S THAT LIKE?

22:48.738 --> 22:50.970
THE PRANK
WITH THE JUMP ROPES...

22:50.970 --> 22:54.444
WAS THAT HARD FOR YOU?
TO HEAR ABOUT IT?
SEE THE PHOTOS?

22:55.445 --> 22:56.946
UM...

22:57.947 --> 22:59.749
I MOSTLY JUST FELT BAD
FOR DANNY.

23:01.481 --> 23:04.153
WHAT, IS THIS ALL
JUST SOME PLOY TO GET ME
TO BE IN YOUR MOVIE TOO?

23:04.153 --> 23:06.756
( chuckles )
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

23:06.756 --> 23:09.088
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.422
ALTHOUGH THAT BEAUTIFUL FACE
DOES BELONG ON A BIG SCREEN.

23:13.723 --> 23:14.964
SORRY. WOW WOW.

23:14.964 --> 23:17.627
THAT WAS REALLY CHEESY,
WASN'T IT?

23:17.627 --> 23:19.869
IT WASN'T NOT CHEESY.

23:19.869 --> 23:22.802
I-I-- I ALWAYS GET
LIKE THIS ON DATES.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.934
I GET NERVOUS
AND THEN I OVERCOMPLIMENT

23:24.934 --> 23:27.507
TO A POINT TO WHERE IT
LOSES ALL ITS MEANING.

23:27.507 --> 23:30.910
- NOT THE BEST STRATEGY.
- HEY, YOU'RE DOING
BETTER THAN ME,

23:30.910 --> 23:35.645
I'M JUST SITTING HERE,
STARING AT MY MENU
SILENTLY.

23:35.645 --> 23:37.847
( both chuckle )

23:37.847 --> 23:38.848
THIS IS, UM...

23:40.850 --> 23:43.923
THIS MAY KIND OF BE
MY FIRST DATE EVER.

23:43.923 --> 23:47.757
WELL, YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

23:47.757 --> 23:49.799
YOU WANNA HEAR
ABOUT MY FIRST DATE?

23:49.799 --> 23:52.762
- I DON'T KNOW, DO I?
- YES, YOU DO.

23:52.762 --> 23:55.765
IT'S A GOOD ONE.
KELLY MOSCOE,

23:55.765 --> 23:58.838
SUMMER AFTER SIXTH GRADE.
WE SAW "UP."

23:58.838 --> 24:01.841
- HER DAD CAME WITH US.
- I DON'T BLAME HIM.

24:01.841 --> 24:04.213
YOU COME ACROSS
PRETTY RAMBUNCTIOUS.

24:04.213 --> 24:07.446
( sputters )
FAIR POINT, FAIR POINT.

24:07.446 --> 24:12.552
SO KELLY STARTED SOBBING
FIVE MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE
AND WOULDN'T STOP.

24:12.552 --> 24:16.556
- MEANWHILE HER DAD IS SITTING
IN THE ROW BEHIND US, SNORING.
- NO!

24:16.556 --> 24:20.059
WOW, SOBBING AND SNORING.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.761
MM-HMM.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.734
I THINK I MAY BE ABLE
TO AVOID THOSE PITFALLS.

24:37.006 --> 24:38.908
THANK YOU FOR THE RIDE.

24:38.908 --> 24:42.211
- SAVED ME A LOT OF WALKING.
- SURE, NO PROBLEM.

24:42.211 --> 24:43.753
AHEM.

24:46.115 --> 24:48.688
ARE YOU WORRIED SOMEONE
MIGHT RECOGNIZE YOUR CAR?

24:48.688 --> 24:50.059
NO.

24:51.761 --> 24:54.093
CUT ME A BREAK, OKAY?

24:54.093 --> 24:56.966
YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M SORRY.

24:56.966 --> 24:59.769
OH HEY, WHEN YOU
COME OVER LATER,

24:59.769 --> 25:02.872
CAN YOU PLEASE REMEMBER
TO BRING PAPER PLATES
AND CUPS?

25:02.872 --> 25:04.974
MY MOTHER TEXTED,
SAYING SHE'S ALLOWING THE PARTY,

25:04.974 --> 25:07.577
SO LONG AS NO ONE TOUCHES
HER FANCY DISHES AND GLASSES.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.642
I DIDN'T SAY
I WAS COMING TONIGHT.

25:12.642 --> 25:14.844
WHAT-- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:16.115 --> 25:18.688
COME ON, WE DON'T HAVE
TO WALK AROUND ARM AND ARM,

25:18.688 --> 25:20.750
BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE
ARE GONNA BE THERE,

25:20.750 --> 25:24.123
- TYLER SAID HE COULD
BRING HALF THE SCHOOL.
- YEAH, BUT NOT MY FRIENDS.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.095
I JUST THINK
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

25:28.658 --> 25:31.931
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU WANT FROM ME, LACEY.
I'M TRYING HERE. I REALLY AM.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.963
I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE TRYING, BUT--

25:33.963 --> 25:37.607
I JUST DON'T THINK
THROWING A PARTY IS
GONNA SOLVE ANYTHING.

25:37.607 --> 25:41.611
IT'S A START. IT'S BETTER
THAN WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING--
"BLENDING IN,"

25:41.611 --> 25:44.243
HIDING AND HOPING
THAT THINGS ARE GONNA
GET BETTER.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.677
I THINK WE CAN BOTH AGREE
THAT'S NOT WORKING.

25:47.677 --> 25:49.819
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
GONNA HAPPEN, DANNY?

25:49.819 --> 25:53.823
ONE PARTY AND SUDDENLY
EVERYONE'S GONNA FORGET
ABOUT YOUR PAST?

25:53.823 --> 25:57.887
- ( stammers )
- I DON'T THINK THAT
THIS IS ABOUT

25:57.887 --> 26:01.030
OTHER PEOPLE
FORGETTING ABOUT MY PAST.
I THINK IT'S ABOUT YOU.

26:02.892 --> 26:06.896
IF THE MASKS
AND THE JUMP ROPES ARE
BRINGING BACK BAD MEMORIES,

26:06.896 --> 26:09.568
IF IT'S MAKING IT WEIRD
FOR YOU TO DATE ME,
I GET THAT,

26:09.568 --> 26:10.800
LACEY, I DO.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.672
BUT JUST LET ME KNOW,

26:12.672 --> 26:15.705
'CAUSE I DON'T WANNA
GET HURT.

26:15.705 --> 26:17.777
IT'S NOT--

26:17.777 --> 26:19.779
IT'S NOT-- IT'S NOT WHAT?

26:21.781 --> 26:23.983
- I-- I--
- GOT IT, I GOT IT.

26:23.983 --> 26:26.255
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

26:26.255 --> 26:27.957
DANNY, WAIT.

26:27.957 --> 26:29.819
( footsteps depart )

26:36.826 --> 26:38.828
( laughter, chattering )

26:52.712 --> 26:54.784
RICO.
THANK YOU FOR COMING, MAN.

26:54.784 --> 26:56.345
OH, CAN I GET YOUR COAT?

26:59.288 --> 27:01.791
- COULD I-- OKAY.
- IS JO HERE?

27:01.791 --> 27:04.994
NOT YET. SHE SAID
SHE AND TYLER WERE COMING
STRAIGHT FROM DINNER.

27:04.994 --> 27:07.096
RIGHT.

27:07.096 --> 27:09.899
OKAY, GOOD.
I'M GONNA

27:09.899 --> 27:12.261
I'M GONNA DO A LAP,
JUST MINGLE WITH SOME FOLKS.

27:14.964 --> 27:18.637
DUDE, THIS HOUSE,
IS IT, LIKE, COLONIAL
OR SOMETHING?

27:18.637 --> 27:21.370
OR EARLY MODERN?
IS IT GOTHICA?

27:21.370 --> 27:25.114
OR IS THAT
A HALLE BERRY MOVIE?
I LIKE HER.

27:25.114 --> 27:27.677
POPCORN.

27:28.978 --> 27:30.780
RIGHT OVER THERE.

27:30.780 --> 27:33.853
- ( door opens )
- OH HEY, COME ON IN.

27:33.853 --> 27:37.356
THANK YOU FOR COMING.
THERE'S CHIPS AND DIP.

27:40.189 --> 27:44.133
- THANK GOD YOU GUYS CAME.
- DUDE, A PROMISE IS A PROMISE.

27:44.133 --> 27:47.436
PLENTY MORE
PEOPLE ON THE WAY.
SHOULD WE JUMP RIGHT IN?

27:47.436 --> 27:49.769
ACTUALLY, CAN WE WAIT
FOR A COUPLE MORE PEOPLE
TO ARRIVE?

27:49.769 --> 27:51.670
FAIR ENOUGH.

27:54.874 --> 27:57.206
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT ALL THIS?
- ABOUT THE INTERVIEW

27:57.206 --> 27:59.709
- OR THE-- THE PARTY?
- BOTH.

27:59.709 --> 28:01.680
YOU SOUND LIKE LACEY.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.855
SO HOW'D YOUR DATE GO?

28:05.855 --> 28:08.017
ACTUALLY...

28:08.017 --> 28:10.389
NOT BAD.
IT WAS FUN.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.291
♪ Oh oh, we're getting
it started... ♪

28:12.291 --> 28:15.094
JO MARIE MASTERSON,
ARE YOU SMITTEN
WITH THIS GUY?

28:15.094 --> 28:18.227
♪ So everybody say
whoa whoa whoa... ♪

28:18.227 --> 28:19.398
I GUESS WE'LL SEE.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.070
♪ Party... ♪

28:21.070 --> 28:23.202
M'LADY.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.205
♪ Every night ♪

28:29.438 --> 28:32.742
♪ We're going to party
all night. ♪

28:32.742 --> 28:35.314
I CAN'T HELP YOU IF YOU
HIDE THINGS FROM ME.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.317
CALM DOWN.
( sighs )

28:38.317 --> 28:41.250
I COULD'VE SWORN THAT
THAT PARK WAS EMPTY.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.452
MAYBE THEY DON'T EVEN
HAVE A REAL WITNESS.

28:43.452 --> 28:47.126
- THEN WHY DID
THEY DRAG THE POND?
- I HAVE NO IDEA!

28:47.126 --> 28:51.060
BUT WHOEVER SAW ME
WAS PROBABLY SOME DRUNK
HOMELESS PERSON

28:51.060 --> 28:54.163
- OR SOMEONE
WHO'S NOT RELIABLE.
- NO, WE CAN'T RISK THAT.

28:54.163 --> 28:57.867
YOU OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE,
YOU DISPOSED OF EVIDENCE
IN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

28:57.867 --> 29:01.010
- THAT'S EXTREMELY SERIOUS.
- I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT
MY SON.

29:01.010 --> 29:04.313
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT NOW YOU HAVE TO GO
BACK TO CHIEF MASTERSON

29:04.313 --> 29:08.117
AND EXPLAIN YOURSELF.
MAYBE HE'LL GO EASY ON YOU.
IT'S NOT YOU THAT HE'S AFTER.

29:08.117 --> 29:11.921
YEAH, IT'S DANNY!
I CANNOT THROW MY SON
UNDER THE BUS.

29:11.921 --> 29:13.322
DANNY IS IN TROUBLE
ANYWAY.

29:13.322 --> 29:15.354
WE'LL FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO HELP HIM,

29:15.354 --> 29:17.927
BUT I HAVE
TO HELP YOU FIRST.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.032
( rock music playing )

29:24.763 --> 29:26.335
ELOISE, I LIKE
YOUR JEANS.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.539
- DOES SHE KNOW HOW TO TALK?
- SHE'S CAPTAIN
OF THE DEBATE TEAM.

29:34.874 --> 29:37.847
RICO, ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU'VE SEEMED KINDA
QUIET ALL NIGHT.

29:37.847 --> 29:41.450
YEAH, I'M JUST
OVERWHELMED BY ALL THIS...

29:41.450 --> 29:43.352
PARTY ENERGY.

29:43.352 --> 29:45.484
I'M GONNA GET
ANOTHER BEER.

29:48.357 --> 29:50.319
THIS POPCORN IS UNREAL.

29:50.319 --> 29:52.391
YOU GOTTA GET IN ON THIS.
LIKE IT'S--

29:52.391 --> 29:54.363
IT'S CHANGING ME.

29:54.363 --> 29:57.396
IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE
COMING BACK, SURE.

29:57.396 --> 30:00.369
IT'S DEFINITELY, UH...
AN ADJUSTMENT.

30:00.369 --> 30:02.371
YOU WERE MAKING
SOME REAL PROGRESS
ON THE SOCCER TEAM.

30:02.371 --> 30:04.003
WHAT HAPPENED THERE,
WHY'D YOU QUIT?

30:04.003 --> 30:06.205
No real reason.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.307
It just didn't
work out socially.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.479
Got it.
That must be rough.

30:10.479 --> 30:13.883
AND HOW ARE YOU
DEALING WITH ALL THESE
VICIOUS PRANKS LATELY?

30:13.883 --> 30:15.885
PRANKS AS IN PLURAL?

30:15.885 --> 30:18.547
OH NO, SORRY, MAN.
I MEANT "PRANK."

30:18.547 --> 30:21.250
YOU KNOW,
THE JUMP ROPES.

30:21.250 --> 30:23.092
WHAT WAS IT LIKE
SEEING THAT?

30:23.092 --> 30:25.294
LIKE I SAID,
IT'S DIFFICULT.

30:25.294 --> 30:28.858
It's hard when
people you don't know are
attacking you like that.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.863
THAT'S--
THAT WAS GREAT, MAN.

30:33.863 --> 30:36.205
WHY DON'T WE
GO ENJOY THE PARTY?

30:36.205 --> 30:38.367
IT SOUNDS GOOD.

30:47.316 --> 30:50.419
COME ON, LACE, LET'S JUST
GO FOR A LITTLE BIT.
EVERYONE'S GOING.

30:50.419 --> 30:52.121
PHOEBE, STOP,
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

30:52.121 --> 30:54.523
WHY WOULD I WANT
TO GO TO A PARTY
AT DANNY DESAI'S HOUSE?

30:54.523 --> 30:57.226
GET SARITA OR, LIKE,
JANA TO GO WITH YOU.

30:57.226 --> 31:01.390
JANA IS HOME SEXTING SCOTT
AND SARITA TOLD ME SHE WOULD
RATHER DRINK COW URINE.

31:01.390 --> 31:04.863
- SOUNDS LIKE SARITA.
- I JUST THINK A NIGHT OUT

31:04.863 --> 31:08.237
WOULD BE REALLY GOOD
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW...
POST-ARCHIE.

31:09.438 --> 31:12.201
BESIDES, MY BROTHER SAID
THE PARTY IS GOING TO BE EPIC.

31:12.201 --> 31:14.643
APPARENTLY SOMETHING HUGE
IS GONNA HAPPEN.

31:14.643 --> 31:17.106
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HUGE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

31:17.106 --> 31:19.108
MY BROTHER SENT AN EMAIL
TO HALF THE SCHOOL,

31:19.108 --> 31:20.950
SAID WE'D ALL BE
TALKING ABOUT IT TOMORROW,

31:20.950 --> 31:23.482
AND THAT IT WOULD
BE A NIGHT THE SOCIO
WOULD NEVER FORGET.

31:31.460 --> 31:33.562
- ( pop music playing )
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE'LL CATCH UP.

31:33.562 --> 31:35.624
- JO?
- HEY!

31:35.624 --> 31:38.427
- HOW WAS THE INTERVIEW?
- IT WAS GOOD, I GUESS.

31:38.427 --> 31:42.571
JO, I KINDA DON'T HAVE
THE BEST FEELING ABOUT
THIS TYLER GUY ANYMORE.

31:42.571 --> 31:45.634
I THINK THAT HE KNOWS MORE
ABOUT THAT JUMP-ROPE PRANK
THAN HE'S LETTING ON.

31:45.634 --> 31:47.977
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

31:47.977 --> 31:50.409
IT'S JUST SOMETHING HE SAID
DURING THE INTERVIEW.

31:50.409 --> 31:53.612
- WHAT DID HE SAY?
- IT'S KINDA HARD TO EXPLAIN.

31:53.612 --> 31:57.016
- HARD TO EXPLAIN?
- I'M JUST SAYING KEEP
AN EYE ON HIM.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.088
- I DON'T TRUST THAT GUY.
- YEAH,

31:59.088 --> 32:01.120
HE CONVINCED
HALF THE CLASS
TO COME TO YOUR PARTY.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.152
BUT WHAT A JERK, RIGHT?

32:03.152 --> 32:05.924
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME
TO GO OUT WITH HIM, DANNY.
- I KNOW THAT, BUT--

32:05.924 --> 32:07.396
WHY DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT YOUR PARTY

32:07.396 --> 32:09.228
AND I'LL WORRY
ABOUT MY DATING LIFE?
SOUND GOOD?

32:17.106 --> 32:19.338
IT'S WEIRD TO BE INSIDE
THIS PLACE, HUH,

32:19.338 --> 32:21.310
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED?

32:21.310 --> 32:24.013
RIGHT. SORRY.

32:24.013 --> 32:26.515
I'M GONNA GO GET A DRINK,
YOU WANT ONE?

32:34.984 --> 32:36.685
WOW, LACEY!

32:36.685 --> 32:40.289
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D SHOW.
WORD HAS REALLY GOTTEN OUT
ABOUT THIS THING.

32:40.289 --> 32:42.191
WHAT'S HAPPENING LATER?

32:42.191 --> 32:44.663
PHOEBE SAID YOU WERE
PLANNING SOMETHING BIG

32:44.663 --> 32:47.336
- AND THAT DANNY
WOULD NEVER FORGET IT.
- NOTHING SPECIFIC,

32:47.336 --> 32:49.638
JUST A WILD PARTY IN HIS HONOR.
ISN'T THAT MEMORABLE ENOUGH?

33:01.080 --> 33:03.352
- JO, HEY, WHERE'S DANNY?
- I HAVE NO CLUE.

33:03.352 --> 33:05.254
- I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T COMING.
- I WASN'T,

33:05.254 --> 33:08.057
BUT PHOEBE SAID HER BROTHER
IS PLANNING SOMETHING BIG
FOR TONIGHT FOR HERE.

33:08.057 --> 33:10.119
THAT'S WHY HE GOT
SO MANY PEOPLE TO COME.

33:10.119 --> 33:13.262
- WHAT KIND OF SOMETHING?
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DON'T
HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT IT.

33:15.124 --> 33:18.267
- HEY, LACEY, YOU CAME.
- WE NEED TO TALK.

33:25.274 --> 33:27.606
( cheering )

33:36.215 --> 33:39.088
RICO?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:39.088 --> 33:40.789
UH...

33:40.789 --> 33:43.392
I HAD A TICKLE
IN MY THROAT

33:43.392 --> 33:46.195
AND I JUST-- I NEEDED
SOME LUBRICATION.

33:46.195 --> 33:48.297
COME ON, YOU'RE UNDERAGE.

33:53.462 --> 33:55.404
( speaking softly )

34:00.769 --> 34:02.641
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S PLANNING?

34:02.641 --> 34:05.714
I DON'T EVEN KNOW,
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST KICK EVERYONE OUT.

34:05.714 --> 34:09.218
OR MAYBE IT'S NOTHING BAD.
MAYBE WE'RE ALL OVERREACTING.

34:14.353 --> 34:15.684
( gasps )

34:17.626 --> 34:19.688
( screams )

34:24.533 --> 34:27.666
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
THE WOMAN THAT DANNY...

34:49.118 --> 34:52.121
THAT'S IT, OUT!
YOU GUYS GET OUT!

34:53.192 --> 34:54.793
NOW!

35:10.279 --> 35:12.641
( door opens )

35:15.144 --> 35:17.216
HEY, THAT WAS FUN, HUH?

35:17.216 --> 35:19.318
( laughs )

35:21.320 --> 35:23.252
YOU OKAY?

35:23.252 --> 35:25.824
- SEEING THAT MUST'VE BEEN--
- I'M FINE.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.359
- HAVE YOU SEEN LACEY?
- NO.

35:31.460 --> 35:33.232
SHE PROBABLY JUST LEFT.

35:33.232 --> 35:36.205
DANNY, I'M REALLY SORRY THAT
THAT HAPPENED.

35:36.205 --> 35:39.538
HEY, IT WAS MY DUMB IDEA
TO THROW A PARTY.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.340
I KINDA DESERVED IT.

35:42.611 --> 35:44.373
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ON MY MOM.

35:44.373 --> 35:46.345
OKAY.

35:51.780 --> 35:54.353
WOW.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.425
THAT WAS NUTS.

35:56.425 --> 35:58.287
HOW'S THE POOR GUY DOING?

35:58.287 --> 36:00.329
HE'S PRETTY SHAKEN UP.

36:01.430 --> 36:03.262
DO YOU KNOW WHO
THOSE PEOPLE WERE?

36:03.262 --> 36:05.494
THE ONE'S WEARING
THE MASKS?

36:05.494 --> 36:07.366
WHO THE HELL KNOWS.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.198
I INVITED EVERYONE
WITH A PULSE.

36:09.198 --> 36:12.241
BY TELLING THEM TO EXPECT
SOMETHING BIG, RIGHT?

36:12.241 --> 36:14.843
YEAH, I HAD
TELL THEM SOMETHING
TO MAKE THEM COME.

36:14.843 --> 36:19.278
- I MEAN, I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.
- I THINK YOU DID.

36:19.278 --> 36:21.810
YOU ORGANIZED THIS,
DIDN'T YOU?

36:21.810 --> 36:24.313
- NO, JO, OF COURSE I DIDN'T--
- DON'T LIE TO ME.

36:24.313 --> 36:28.287
I SAW YOU FILMING IT.
YOU WERE SMILING.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.959
AND THE JUMP ROPES,
THAT WAS YOU TOO,
WASN'T IT?

36:36.265 --> 36:40.829
LOOK, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
TO CREATE YOUR OWN REALITY.

36:40.829 --> 36:43.932
WHEN PEOPLE SEE MY MOVIE,
ALL THESE THINGS,

36:43.932 --> 36:46.305
THESE PRANKS?

36:46.305 --> 36:48.837
IT'S GONNA MAKE PEOPLE
SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM.

36:48.837 --> 36:50.309
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

36:50.309 --> 36:54.513
- I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.
- JO, IT WAS JUST A STUNT.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.385
PLEASE.

36:56.385 --> 36:58.216
I HAD FUN TONIGHT.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.549
I THINK WE HAVE
A LOT OF POTENTIAL.

37:00.549 --> 37:02.851
WE DID.
TOO BAD YOU BLEW IT.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.402
HEY.

37:13.402 --> 37:16.365
- I ASSUMED YOU'D LEFT.
- I DID.

37:16.365 --> 37:19.368
I TOLD PHOEBE I NEEDED
TO WALK HOME ALONE
TO "REFLECT."

37:21.410 --> 37:23.672
THEN I SNUCK BACK HERE.

37:23.672 --> 37:25.914
HOW IS HE?

37:25.914 --> 37:27.876
HE IS CHECKING ON HIS MOM.

37:29.878 --> 37:33.322
THE PARTY'S PRETTY MUCH
CLEARED OUT, IF YOU WANTED
TO GO IN AND TALK TO HIM.

37:35.624 --> 37:38.256
IT WAS MY IDEA
TO GO INSIDE.

37:40.729 --> 37:43.632
FIVE YEARS AGO,
WHEN DANNY CAME OUT HERE

37:43.632 --> 37:46.935
AND HE SAID WHAT HE SAID
AND YOU WANTED TO LEAVE,
REMEMBER?

37:46.935 --> 37:49.468
GO GET HELP?

37:49.468 --> 37:52.541
BUT I HAD TO GO IN

37:52.541 --> 37:55.404
AND SEE WHAT HE MEANT.

37:56.475 --> 37:59.378
GOD, I WAS SUCH
AN IDIOT.

38:01.710 --> 38:04.313
- ( sighs )
- YOU WERE JUST A KID.

38:04.313 --> 38:06.655
I WAS AN IDIOTIC KID.

38:10.018 --> 38:12.391
I STILL THINK ABOUT
THAT IMAGE ALL THE TIME--

38:12.391 --> 38:13.922
TARA'S BODY LYING
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

38:15.594 --> 38:17.426
YEAH, ME TOO.

38:17.426 --> 38:20.669
I DON'T NEED SOME DUMB PRANK
TO REMIND ME OF THAT.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.532
GOD, FREAKING TYLER.

38:23.532 --> 38:25.674
WHY DID HE DO THAT?
FOR THE ATTENTION?

38:25.674 --> 38:28.607
NO, IT'S FOR...

38:28.607 --> 38:32.711
THE DOCUMENTARY HE'S MAKING
ON DANNY COMING BACK.

38:32.711 --> 38:35.814
I CAN'T BELIEVE I WENT
ON A DATE WITH THAT GUY TONIGHT.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.046
HEY, HE IS HOT.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.452
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

38:43.452 --> 38:45.994
YOU KNOW,
BEFORE WE FOUND OUT
HE'S A TOTAL CREEP?

38:45.994 --> 38:49.628
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS NICE...

38:49.628 --> 38:54.332
TO HAVE SOMEONE
LOOK AT ME THAT WAY,

38:54.332 --> 38:56.865
THINK OF ME THAT WAY.
YOU KNOW?

38:56.865 --> 39:01.039
PRETTY? YOU ARE.
YOU'RE GORGEOUS

39:01.039 --> 39:03.872
AND FUNNY AND SMART.

39:05.574 --> 39:08.346
YOU DESERVE
TO FIND SOMEONE GREAT.

39:12.621 --> 39:15.554
- DATING IS SO FRUSTRATING.
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

39:17.686 --> 39:20.088
HOW'S LIFE AFTER ARCHIE?

39:20.088 --> 39:22.391
CONFUSING.

39:22.391 --> 39:24.693
ISN'T IT ALWAYS CONFUSING?

39:27.035 --> 39:28.897
I BET IT'S WORTH IT THOUGH,

39:28.897 --> 39:31.440
IF YOU DO FIND
THE RIGHT GUY.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.979
- HEY.
- OH, DANNY, HEY.

39:40.979 --> 39:43.912
UM, I'M JUST
WAITING FOR JO.

39:43.912 --> 39:46.455
- I TOLD HER I'D WALK HER HOME.
- OH, THAT'S NICE OF YOU, MAN.

39:46.455 --> 39:49.017
- YEAH.
- WHERE-- WHERE IS SHE?

39:49.017 --> 39:52.421
- OUTSIDE, TALKING TO LACEY.
- LACEY'S STILL HERE?

39:53.422 --> 39:55.424
THIS NIGHT IS FULL
OF SURPRISES.

39:55.424 --> 39:58.727
UH, THIS WATER
IS DELICIOUS.

39:58.727 --> 40:00.899
VERY VERY CRISP.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.432
YOU WERE RIGHT, YOU KNOW?

40:03.432 --> 40:07.035
ABOUT THE... TYLER GUY.
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO YOU.

40:08.937 --> 40:11.580
- SORRY THAT HAPPENED TO YOU.
- THAT'S OKAY.

40:11.580 --> 40:14.142
AT LEAST SHE'S NOT GONNA GO
OUT WITH HIM AGAIN, RIGHT?

40:15.744 --> 40:17.616
SHE SHOULD BE WITH
SOMEONE WHO GETS HER,

40:17.616 --> 40:19.187
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE
WHO APPRECIATES HER.

40:19.187 --> 40:22.050
- SOMEONE LIKE YOU?
- WHAT? NO.

40:22.050 --> 40:24.192
YOU HAVE A THING FOR HER,
RIGHT, RICO?

40:24.192 --> 40:27.025
WHAT? NO WAY.

40:30.959 --> 40:34.002
UM, WHATEVER. YOU KNOW,
IT DOESN'T MATTER, ANYWAYS.

40:34.002 --> 40:36.204
SHE'S NEVER GONNA
THINK OF ME THAT WAY.

40:36.204 --> 40:38.066
LOOK, DUDE,

40:38.066 --> 40:40.909
YOU DON'T KNOW
IF YOU DON'T ASK HER.

40:40.909 --> 40:44.072
- ( door opens )
- NAW, SOMETIMES YOU JUST KNOW.

40:44.072 --> 40:46.975
- ( door closes )
- ( girls murmuring )

40:46.975 --> 40:49.177
HOW YOU
DOING THERE, WINO?

40:49.177 --> 40:51.119
GROSS.
ALCOHOL IS EVIL.

40:51.119 --> 40:53.752
- ( laughing )
- I KNOW.

40:53.752 --> 40:57.125
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
TAKE THIS DRUNK GUY HOME.

40:58.126 --> 41:00.529
I'LL STAY.
HELP YOU CLEAN UP.

41:03.832 --> 41:06.234
- ( door opens, closes )
- SO...

41:06.234 --> 41:09.538
- YOU STAYED.
- I DID.

41:09.538 --> 41:12.170
HOW'S YOUR MOM DOING?

41:12.170 --> 41:14.673
SHE'S PRETTY UPSET.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.545
SHE WENT FOR A WALK,

41:16.545 --> 41:19.477
SAID SHE NEEDED
TO CLEAR HER HEAD
AFTER ALL THAT CRAZINESS.

41:19.477 --> 41:22.651
YEAH, I DON'T BLAME HER.

41:22.651 --> 41:26.655
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA RUN FOR THE HILLS
AFTER THAT PRANK.

41:27.816 --> 41:29.888
I KINDA DID TOO.

41:31.119 --> 41:33.191
( sighs )
I'M SORRY
I FREAKED OUT BEFORE.

41:33.191 --> 41:35.664
DON'T BE.
DON'T BE SORRY.

41:35.664 --> 41:39.528
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
GIVEN YOU SUCH A HARD TIME
ABOUT THE SECRET THING.

41:39.528 --> 41:42.030
AND I KNOW...

41:42.030 --> 41:44.633
HOW MUCH YOU'RE RISKING
BEING WITH ME.

41:44.633 --> 41:46.905
WELL...

41:46.905 --> 41:48.807
IT'S WORTH THE RISK.

41:48.807 --> 41:51.239
( instrumental music playing )

42:37.726 --> 42:39.257
SHE IN MY OFFICE?

42:39.257 --> 42:41.259
SHE SAID SHE'D ONLY
TALK TO YOU.

42:47.295 --> 42:49.738
IT'S LATE, KAREN.

42:49.738 --> 42:52.901
I KNOW. THIS COULDN'T
WAIT TILL THE MORNING.

42:53.902 --> 42:55.674
OKAY.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.678
SHOULD WE CALL
MR. DILLARD?

42:59.678 --> 43:02.150
NO, NO LAWYERS.

43:02.150 --> 43:04.252
JUST THE TRUTH.

43:04.252 --> 43:06.615
AND WHAT IS THE TRUTH?

43:12.090 --> 43:15.123
IT WAS ME. I DID IT.

43:18.066 --> 43:21.229
I KILLED REGINA CRANE.
