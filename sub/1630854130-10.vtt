WEBVTT

00:04.713 --> 00:05.088
.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.006
- So now I'm soaked
head to toe,

00:07.257 --> 00:09.259
chasing his naked ass down
block after block--

00:09.300 --> 00:10.468
- I've you run.

00:10.510 --> 00:11.553
You weren't chasing
more than four.

00:11.594 --> 00:12.929
- Ha. Very funny.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.682
Anyway, I'm going and going,
then this dude spins.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.475
And he comes
barreling right at me.

00:17.517 --> 00:20.103
He slams into me,
tries to smother me

00:20.145 --> 00:21.730
with his naked body.

00:21.771 --> 00:22.981
Thinks I'm a woman.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.357
I'm his woman
is what he's saying.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.026
- Come on,
can you land the plane?

00:26.067 --> 00:27.402
Come on.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.112
- So finally,
I haul him into 19

00:29.154 --> 00:32.115
and guess what's waiting
for me next morning?

00:32.157 --> 00:33.283
- What's that?

00:33.324 --> 00:35.660
- Fresh complaint.
Guy filed a CR.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.537
I'm taking eight showers,

00:37.579 --> 00:39.581
and this guy's saying
I came on to him.

00:39.622 --> 00:42.167
Says he ran
'cause I wanted to tickle him.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.501
His words--tickle.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.379
- Well, did you?
- Then what?

00:46.421 --> 00:47.505
- What do you mean "then what"?

00:47.547 --> 00:49.632
- Is that the whole story?

00:49.674 --> 00:51.676
- Yeah! Yes.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.512
The crazy son of a bitch
got out after '72,

00:54.554 --> 00:57.474
and I got mandatory retraining.

00:57.515 --> 00:58.892
- Took us a hell of a long time
to get there.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.477
Flip the cards, Wilk. Come on.

01:00.518 --> 01:03.688
- Hey, how about you?
Got your first CR yet?

01:03.730 --> 01:06.941
- No.
- Yeah, you'll get 'em.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.736
Every real police get 'em.
- Yeah. Amen to that.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.405
- Why'd you become police,
young guy like you?

01:14.282 --> 01:15.784
- Did you grow up
on the West Side?

01:18.536 --> 01:20.163
- Pilsen.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.331
Yeah.

01:22.791 --> 01:23.792
Yeah.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.169
I'm all in.

01:30.173 --> 01:33.176
- No, no, thank you. I'm out.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.636
- Hot streak
don't last forever.

01:34.678 --> 01:35.637
I'll call.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.180
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Okay.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.306
- It's a game.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.892
- This is it
and drumroll please.

01:40.934 --> 01:41.935
- Bang.
- Boom.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.353
- Whoo. I got trips.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.688
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:44.729 --> 01:45.563
- A pair of eights.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.691
- Dante, whoa, what happened?

01:47.732 --> 01:48.858
- Kicking our teeth in
all night.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.110
You go all in on that?

01:50.151 --> 01:52.404
- Let me get that.
- I guess I lost my touch.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.447
- Lucky for Banks.
[laughter]

01:54.489 --> 01:56.282
- Hey, how about
this old-timer thing?

01:56.324 --> 01:58.451
- I'ma call it on that one.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.203
- Okay.
- Good night.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.788
- All right.
- Come back anytime.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.289
- Yeah.

02:03.331 --> 02:04.624
- Another one?
- You buying?

02:04.666 --> 02:05.959
- It's all me, buddy.
I got you.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.293
- Be right back.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.253
- All right,
we'll save your place.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.254
- I'm gonna go ahead.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.256
- Torres, hey.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.133
What was that?

02:13.174 --> 02:14.884
Did you throw your hand?

02:14.926 --> 02:16.302
You threw it.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.804
- I just got too cocky.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.639
- How you getting home, man?
I drove you.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.308
- Uh, there's a thing
called Uber.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.643
- Come on,
I'm gonna give you a ride.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.645
- No, it's all right, man.
You go back to the guys.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.813
I ain't trying
to ruin the night.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.398
- I brought you here.
You're my guest.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.567
I'm gonna get you home.
Let me just grab my stuff.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.324
So that's not really
your thing, huh?

02:38.366 --> 02:40.076
- I had a good time, bro.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.620
I appreciate you
bringing me up.

02:42.662 --> 02:43.747
- All right.

02:43.788 --> 02:44.998
Yeah, you know,
Wilkins was on one.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.499
I'll give you that.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.044
It is good to know other cops.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.087
Helps make the job
a little easier, you know.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.173
It sounds strange,
but it's true.

02:53.214 --> 02:54.674
- How long you known them for?

02:54.716 --> 02:57.177
- Some of them since
I was a kid, actually.

02:57.218 --> 02:58.887
Started going there
with my dad,

02:58.928 --> 03:00.221
like the baby in the bar
kind of thing.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.306
- Right.
- Yeah.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.058
Probably a little too young.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.976

05:19.402 --> 05:20.820
Gonna get you out
of this, all right?

05:20.862 --> 05:23.865

off your hands.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.033
Okay?

05:25.075 --> 05:27.160
But I'm gonna need
to touch you for that.

Monica, are you okay?

05:35.710 --> 05:37.587

05:41.424 --> 05:42.759
It's okay.

05:44.386 --> 05:45.512
- Gonna get you
over there to her.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.846
I promise you.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.390
You just gotta stay still
for a second longer

05:48.431 --> 05:50.767
so I can get this damn knot.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.400

05:58.441 --> 06:00.527
You're safe now.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.571
Can you try to look at me?

Okay, I'm gonna need you
to breathe for me.

- [sniffling]

06:38.898 --> 06:40.442
Home invasion turned
sexual assault.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.485
Two-man crew, masked, gloved.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.362
- No sign of forced entry?
- No.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.405
- Was there an alarm?

06:45.447 --> 06:47.115
- Yeah, it didn't go off.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.701
So Louis's wife Monica
fall asleep on the couch early.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.829
Louis wakes up to a man
in a mask standing above him,

06:52.871 --> 06:55.665
pointing a gun in his face,
yelling about a safe combo.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.208
- Huh.
- And Louis gave it to him.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.586
The second offender took them
upstairs, tied them up,

06:59.627 --> 07:02.672
raped Monica,
and had Louis watch.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.011
- Looks like they move fast.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.763
- Louis heard the guy
downstairs yell,

07:09.804 --> 07:11.598
"Just tie them up,"
and the guy upstairs

07:11.639 --> 07:12.974
was just supposed
to keep them quiet

07:13.016 --> 07:14.934
while the other guy
ripped off the house.

07:14.976 --> 07:18.271
But I guess he wasn't
just here for cash.

07:18.313 --> 07:21.399
- All right, knock-and-talks,
pull cams, previous hits,

07:21.441 --> 07:22.776
get a rape kit at Med.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.986
Let's find these men
before they hit again.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.948
- Hey, Monica's still at Med.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.784
Doesn't remember anything
about the offender

07:30.825 --> 07:32.160
except that he's thin
and white.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.620
- PODs?
- Mm-mm.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.497
No PODs, no security cameras.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.623
- Okay, what about
the neighbor,

07:36.664 --> 07:38.541
the lady who called it in?

07:38.583 --> 07:40.460
- Well, she said that
she saw the offender

07:40.502 --> 07:41.795
through the window.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.630
She hid and just called 911,
but she does think

07:43.672 --> 07:45.799
she saw a gray SUV
parked out front.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.092
- That's something.
We got CODIS?

07:47.133 --> 07:48.968
- No hits.
They're way backed up.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.720
So is the rape kit.
Gonna call my guy down there.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.097
I'm trying to get him
to rush it, but--

07:52.138 --> 07:53.682
- I got something.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.058
Borkowski over at
Robbery Homicide's

07:55.100 --> 07:56.768
got a two-man crew
targeting Lincoln Park.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.770
They've hit twice,
no forced entry,

07:58.812 --> 08:00.146
and only hit
when the owners are home.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.816
- Okay, good. Check it out.
See what they got.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.943
- Dante, you wanna
ride with me?

08:04.984 --> 08:06.903
- Yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.032
- So you get me hammered
and you try to steal

08:11.074 --> 08:12.826
one of my cases, huh?
- Yeah.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.994
- Yeah, well, about to win
a flat screen TV,

08:15.036 --> 08:17.163
so you're not taking
this one from me.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.124
Work it together
or you can work it none.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.959
- Two-man crew masked.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.461
- Yeah, uh, always gloved,
always masked,

08:23.503 --> 08:25.171
no mess till now.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.673
I think they're getting access
through the garages.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.174
They move in a gray SUV.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.551
- But no rape?

08:30.552 --> 08:31.970
- No.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.014
But 16-year-old daughter
on the last robbery

08:34.055 --> 08:36.099
said one of the guys
whispered in her ear

08:36.141 --> 08:37.684
how we'd like to
take her from behind

08:37.726 --> 08:39.978
while her daddy watched.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.313
- Nice.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.732
- Yeah.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.858
So I think he said more,
but she clammed up.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.109
She wouldn't tell me.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.072
Not handing this one over,
not this one.

08:51.114 --> 08:54.617
- All right, we hook up.
We work a joint.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.661
Yo, Voight'll sign off.
You have my word.

08:56.703 --> 08:57.787
We'll work it together.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.375
- All right, good.
'Cause I got lead.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.461
One of my CIs saw two
of our Rolexes at a pawn shop.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.212
- All right.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.797
- Well, why are you
sitting on this?

09:07.839 --> 09:09.632
- So we work it together.

09:09.674 --> 09:10.925
Shall we?

09:12.802 --> 09:14.054
<i>- No, no, no,</i>
<i>I got nothing for you.</i>

09:14.095 --> 09:15.430
- Now we both know
that's a lie.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.223
You got two of my Rolexes.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.892
They were stolen two weeks ago
from Lincoln Park.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.644
- No.
Your spies told you wrong.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.355
- No, they didn't.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.815
You know they didn't.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.025
You got 'em right here.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.110
- No, those are
from Maxwell Street.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.531
[tapping]

09:33.573 --> 09:34.908
Come on, I can't afford that.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.409
- What else he give you?

09:36.451 --> 09:38.370
- Nothing, okay?

09:38.411 --> 09:39.954
Nothing.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.331
- Hard to believe you
when the first words

09:41.373 --> 09:42.457
out of your mouth's a lie.

09:42.499 --> 09:43.958
- Please.
[tapping]

09:44.000 --> 09:46.544
Come on, I just fixed the glass
you broke last month.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.714
- They raped a woman.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.257
You don't want business
with these men.

09:51.299 --> 09:55.095
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

09:55.136 --> 09:58.139
- He only gave me
those two watches.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.266

10:00.308 --> 10:01.643
Tell me about this man.

<i>Where are you guys?</i>

10:16.324 --> 10:18.660

We got it.

<i>- All right, copy.</i>

possible home invasion

<i>- Copy 50-21 Ida.</i>

10:45.562 --> 10:47.647

There, there.

10:49.441 --> 10:52.110

- What?

13:07.996 --> 13:11.374
- His shoes are wrong.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.043
Offender that fled
had white shoes on.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.883
- Guy fled as soon as
he saw it was police.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.386
- What happened?

13:23.428 --> 13:25.847
- Guy ran,
fell down the stairs.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.934
- He got this from falling.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.312
- Yeah, that's what I said.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.731
All right, I'm gonna go
flag down the ambo.

Mark and Rebecca Adams.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.048
Got defensive wounds
on both of them.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.800
All signs point
to sexual assault.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.093
- Yo, Sarge.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.220
The Adams were shot
with a 9-millimeter.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.223
I got .380 casings
and a slug in the door.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.849
Different gun,
different blood splatter.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.142
This might not be their blood.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.519
- Someone tagged an offender?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.688
- Well, one of them
did seem injured.

14:14.729 --> 14:17.023
- Rebecca or Mark have a gun?
- None that were registered.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.358
- You know what,
at the first robbery,

14:18.400 --> 14:20.068
victim said the offenders
were fighting.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.361
Maybe they turned
on each other.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.862
- Look, this pair's
turning on each other,

14:22.904 --> 14:24.155
they're gonna be
making mistakes,

14:24.197 --> 14:26.157
leaving evidence behind.
Find it.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.535
Hey, we get a name
on the offender in custody?

14:28.576 --> 14:31.538
- Alex Curry, 22, priors for
possession and petty theft.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.997
He's on his way to Med.
- Okay.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.125
We'll meet him there.
Get him to talk.

14:47.929 --> 14:50.181
- Yo, what you doing?

14:50.223 --> 14:51.516
- I'm here to interview Alex.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.268
- I just did.
- He's conscious.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.728
All the initial scans
are clear,

14:54.769 --> 14:56.438
but he's no good
for the robbery.

14:56.479 --> 14:57.731
- How is that?

14:57.772 --> 14:59.441
- Well, you were right.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.651
The shoes weren't a match,
right?

15:01.693 --> 15:03.236
He was unarmed.
He had no mask on him.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.946
He gave a believable statement.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.614
He's got a couple
of priors, right.

15:06.656 --> 15:07.824
He ran because he's jumpy.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.409
- And fell.
- Yeah.

15:09.451 --> 15:12.287
Man, he feels like crap,
but least he was unarmed,

15:12.328 --> 15:13.455
so he won't be charged.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.710
I got it. I took his statement.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.753
I'll let Voight and Ruzek know.

15:19.794 --> 15:20.712
- Okay.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.132
Did Alex see anything?

15:24.174 --> 15:26.885
- No. Nothing.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.387
- All right.
[phone buzzing]

15:29.429 --> 15:31.639
- Look.

15:31.681 --> 15:32.849
I gotta take this, okay?

15:32.891 --> 15:34.267
You're good to clear out.

15:34.309 --> 15:35.977
See you at 21.
- Yeah.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.154
Alex Curry?

15:50.075 --> 15:51.993
- Yeah.
I just talked to your partner.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.496
- No, he--he's not my partner.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.624
We're in different units.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.585
So I'm gonna have to ask you
a few questions too.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.670
Is that okay with you?

16:01.711 --> 16:02.879
- I don't have
anything else to say.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.381
- It's only gonna
take a minute.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.720
Can you explain to me
what happened?

16:13.056 --> 16:16.142
- Like I told the other cop,

16:16.184 --> 16:19.729
I heard shots,
saw the police, ran.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.648
I got priors, so I got jumpy.

16:24.859 --> 16:25.777
- And then?

16:28.113 --> 16:29.698
- I fell down the stairs.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.202
- Are you lying to me, Alex?

16:36.121 --> 16:37.914
- What? No.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.040
- You sure?

16:39.082 --> 16:41.793
- Yes.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.754
- So you fell down the stairs
but only hurt your head.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.423
No scratches, no bruises.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.841
You didn't try
to break the fall?

16:47.882 --> 16:49.884
- I fell backwards.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.429
- You fell backwards.

16:52.470 --> 16:53.805
Right.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.223
So how'd you get that gash
on the side of your head?

16:55.265 --> 16:58.351
<i>[tense music]</i>

- Hey.

17:11.740 --> 17:13.575
I told you we were good.

17:16.745 --> 17:17.704
Just got word from Ruzek.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.539
POD footage
got the getaway car.

17:19.581 --> 17:20.915
We got an ID.
Guy's got an open warrant.

We're moving.

Police!

Stop. Stop fighting. Stop.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.729
You're not getting
your hands back, so stop.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.400
- What was that?

18:28.441 --> 18:29.901
You always move through
a line of sight like that?

18:29.943 --> 18:31.861
I could have shot you.
You announce before you move.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.949

- Dante, you coming?

19:02.267 --> 19:03.393

Must be your
irresistible charm, huh?

19:11.317 --> 19:13.153

for a favor?

19:13.194 --> 19:14.612
- I don't know.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.656
- Is it possible
for you to print out

19:16.698 --> 19:18.992
the reports from the
Adams robbery for me?

19:19.034 --> 19:20.660
And a personnel file?

19:20.702 --> 19:21.995
- There a reason
you can't print it

19:22.037 --> 19:23.163
from your desk in the bullpen?

19:23.204 --> 19:24.622
- Yes, there is.

19:26.541 --> 19:29.711
- Okay, I'll take care of it.

- Hey.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.425
Careful.

19:42.932 --> 19:47.020
- So it's not some run-
of-the-mill burglary charge.

19:47.062 --> 19:49.814
It's armed home invasion.
Now, that's 30 years.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.526
You add on top of that
the rape, two felony murders,

19:53.568 --> 19:57.238
the fact that your partner
took shots at the police...

19:59.366 --> 20:01.242
See where I'm going with this?

20:01.284 --> 20:03.745
It's life in a concrete box.

20:03.787 --> 20:04.871
You understand?

20:08.249 --> 20:10.335
- Pawn shop owner ID'd you.

We got your car at the Adamses.

20:12.504 --> 20:15.382
Recovered the .380 on you.

20:15.423 --> 20:16.966
We know you did
these robberies.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.927
- That's all without DNA.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.765
- Go ahead and run your tests.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.100
I don't care.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.519
- Okay, you don't care.

20:27.560 --> 20:34.067
So when we pull DNA
from inside their bodies,

20:34.109 --> 20:35.735
we gonna find yours in there?

20:38.613 --> 20:41.449
- Yo, that wasn't me.

- I believe you.

<i>You didn't like it.</i>

Who is he?

<i>All the guy would say</i>

22:02.030 --> 22:03.740
then he told me to go
screw myself repeatedly.

22:03.782 --> 22:05.950
- Ballistics confirm the
.380 came from the gun

22:05.992 --> 22:07.369
recovered at Thompson's.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.120
- Yeah, Thompson's got no love
for his rapist buddy,

22:09.162 --> 22:11.373
but he knows he'll implicate
himself if he talks.

22:11.414 --> 22:12.791
He's not as dumb as he looks.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.542
- All right,
any hits on area hospitals?

22:14.584 --> 22:16.002
- Mm-mm, none of the
shooting victims

22:16.044 --> 22:17.212
match our offender.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.005
- Okay, what about the DNA,
the rape kits?

22:19.047 --> 22:22.008
- Nothing yet.
- Jesus. Well, keep pressing.

22:22.050 --> 22:24.719
All right, so meantime,
let's dig into Thompson.

22:24.761 --> 22:27.138
He's working with this guy.
He's gotta know him, right?

22:27.180 --> 22:30.892
So we're on his phone,
socials, LKAs, associates.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.560
Find this guy.

22:43.488 --> 22:44.614
- Yo.

22:44.656 --> 22:45.907
Gotta talk to you.

- Yeah, what's up?

22:47.242 --> 22:49.411

- Sure.

22:59.921 --> 23:01.715
All right,
what's going on, man?

23:01.756 --> 23:03.174
Why all the secrecy?

23:06.219 --> 23:07.887
- The arrest report, why?

23:07.929 --> 23:09.556
- You signed off
on Borkowski's version

23:09.597 --> 23:11.433
of events at the Adams'?
- Yeah.

23:11.474 --> 23:14.352
Why are you asking like that?

23:14.394 --> 23:17.272
- Dude, I think he lied.

23:17.313 --> 23:20.066
I think he beat that kid Alex
while he was in cuffs.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.862
- You saw this?

23:23.903 --> 23:25.488
- No.

23:25.530 --> 23:30.118
- Okay, 'cause Borkowski said
he ran, fell down the stairs.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.536
You're saying he beat him?

23:31.578 --> 23:33.455
- There was no blood
on the stairs.

23:33.496 --> 23:35.123
Nothing.

23:35.165 --> 23:38.501
And Alex's injuries,
they don't make sense.

23:38.543 --> 23:40.170
And I talked to Alex.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.546
He was lying.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.632
He was scared.

23:44.674 --> 23:47.302
Borkowski beat him,
and then he paid him off.

23:47.344 --> 23:48.762
- Hey, let's keep
your voice down.

23:48.803 --> 23:54.392
- I know you know him,
and you see him a certain way.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.061
I think I see him
different than you.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.020
- Well, how do I see him?

23:57.062 --> 24:00.732
- No, I see him
as the cops that

24:00.774 --> 24:03.651
used to patrol Pilsen,
used to harass store owners

24:03.693 --> 24:06.738
and make bets on cases, homey.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.740
Type of guy that asks people
like me why we're police.

24:21.211 --> 24:23.213
- Yeah, well, real cops
get CRs, Torres.

All right, just come on.

The CR is just gonna
get thrown out,

24:53.702 --> 24:54.828
he'll get you pulled
from the unit.

He'll get you pulled

Hey.
- Nah, man.

25:20.061 --> 25:21.396
I already gave you the full

- Yeah, I need something else.

25:22.814 --> 25:25.775
I want to take a look at

Borkowski lied.

You can tell us.

Just stay low.

That was a direct order.
