WEBVTT

00:07.208 --> 00:08.576
[phone ringing]

00:09.643 --> 00:11.579
Hello?

00:11.612 --> 00:14.082
Yeah.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.683
Yeah.

00:15.716 --> 00:16.517
Yeah.

00:19.553 --> 00:20.554
Yeah.

00:20.588 --> 00:21.389
Yeah.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.060
Well wasn't that cute?

00:26.094 --> 00:27.928
D.J. just closed
this first drug deal.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.000
What's he up to?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.402
I have no idea,
but I have a feeling

00:34.435 --> 00:38.406
that it threatens all that is
good and decent in the world.

00:38.439 --> 00:42.910
D.J. get out here,
breakfast is ready.

00:42.943 --> 00:43.811
Yuck!

00:43.844 --> 00:45.879
These aren't the microwave kind!

00:45.913 --> 00:46.780
I know.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.782
The microwave died this morning.

00:48.816 --> 00:52.486
It's OK to cry, your dad did.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.956
I only like the frozen ones.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.092
OK, fine.

00:58.126 --> 00:59.260
Gonna be ready in an hour.

01:02.863 --> 01:03.731
I have to go.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.266
Where's my lunch?

01:05.299 --> 01:08.236
Right there.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.671
I'm going to look like
a dork carrying this.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.306
Yes you will, but
this way, people

01:12.340 --> 01:15.476
might think it's the bag.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.644
I hate tuna!

01:16.677 --> 01:17.911
I'm not going to eat this!

01:17.945 --> 01:19.012
Hey!

01:19.046 --> 01:20.314
I worked hard to make
that tuna sandwich.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.116
You're going to take it,
you're going to go to school,

01:22.150 --> 01:25.085
and at lunch, you're going to
trade it for something decent.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.954
Fine!

01:26.987 --> 01:29.257
What's his problem?

01:29.290 --> 01:31.024
Well, I've seen it before.

01:31.058 --> 01:32.393
He's 12.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.027
He's crabby.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.463
He's becoming a woman.

01:38.632 --> 01:39.500
Odd.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.469
It happened so fast.

01:41.502 --> 01:42.803
Yeah.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.772
Well I guess he has to take
over for Darlene since Satan

01:44.805 --> 01:47.875
transferred her to Chicago.

01:47.908 --> 01:48.976
Well, thanks for the teabags.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.444
You mind if I take
this lemon and

01:50.478 --> 01:52.012
the coffee mug and
that tea kettle

01:52.045 --> 01:53.314
too unless you've
got a newer one.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.315
Jackie!

01:54.348 --> 01:56.350
Well, I've got to
furnish our house!

01:56.384 --> 01:58.051
Well hey, why don't
you weasel stuff

01:58.085 --> 01:59.520
out of people the
classy way-- throw

01:59.553 --> 02:02.523
yourself a housewarming party.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.857
I can't do that.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.093
If I have a party, I have to
invite mom and she'll come.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.697
Then she'll be there.
- All right, fine.

02:09.730 --> 02:13.133
Well I'll throw you a surprise
party and I won't tell mom, OK?

02:13.167 --> 02:15.236
And if she finds out about
it, I'll take the heat.

02:15.269 --> 02:18.105
No, you won't take the heat,
you'll cave in and ask her.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.207
I will not.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.810
You have no idea how
much I will not cave.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.613
And I know just what to
tell people to get you too.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.780
A microwave.

02:26.814 --> 02:27.948
I don't need a
microwave, you're

02:27.981 --> 02:30.050
the one that needs a microwave.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.485
Hey, wait a minute.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.454
Isn't it just great when
all the parts of your brain

02:33.487 --> 02:34.488
start working
together as a team?

02:51.505 --> 02:53.307
George?

02:53.341 --> 02:54.508
Yeah, she's gone.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.678
You can come over now.

02:57.711 --> 03:01.081
[theme song]

03:42.523 --> 03:44.425
[laughing]

03:50.664 --> 03:52.566
Yeah, well I know a
microwave's expensive,

03:52.600 --> 03:54.101
but you shouldn't be so selfish.

03:54.134 --> 03:57.204
You should think about
Jackie for a change.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.408
Well, maybe-- maybe
she could use a--

04:00.441 --> 04:01.442
a car.

04:04.345 --> 04:07.180
No, a car would be crazy.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.616
A mustache comb.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.687
No, that's even
better, yeah, yeah.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.056
You can never have too
many 3D pictures of Jesus.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.661
Bye.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.664
This is a tea kettle!

04:23.697 --> 04:27.234
No, this is a tea kettle.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.372
That is a teapot!

04:31.405 --> 04:34.675
Oh god, here comes Fred.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.210
Oh, Jackie's little huggums.

04:37.244 --> 04:40.481
He's not my little huggums and
he's not invited to that party.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.115
You know, you ought
to give Fred a chance.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.585
He's one of your better
sleazy one-night stands

04:44.618 --> 04:46.053
that you've ever had.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.488
You should get to
know him vertically.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.193
Just let me handle it, OK?

04:53.226 --> 04:55.329
Tell him I'm not here.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.730
FRED: Hey Roseanne?

04:56.764 --> 04:58.999
Is Jackie around?

04:59.032 --> 05:00.868
Jackie, did you want me
to tell him you're gone

05:00.901 --> 05:02.403
or that you just stepped out?

05:05.238 --> 05:07.207
Thanks a lot, Roseanne.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.043
Well, we both knew
I was going to do it.

05:10.077 --> 05:10.944
Hey, Jackie.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.145
Hi, Fred.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.681
This is where you leave.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.315
OK.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.817
Well, you can't tell
with his clothes on,

05:16.850 --> 05:18.151
but I'll believe you.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.129
Jackie, I know you don't
want to talk about this before,

05:29.162 --> 05:31.131
but-- but I just got to
tell you, I had a really

05:31.164 --> 05:32.299
nice time the other night.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.168
Well, of course you
did, Fred, and we had sex.

05:38.639 --> 05:39.840
Sex?

05:39.873 --> 05:42.042
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I remember now.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.276
That was right after
dinner and right

05:43.310 --> 05:44.745
before I thanked
you for an hour.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.046
Yeah.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.681
Fred, you're really sweet--
- Did you get the flowers?

05:47.715 --> 05:49.383
- I got the flowers.
- Did you get the candy?

05:49.417 --> 05:50.451
Yeah, I got the candy.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.785
Did you get the 20
bucks on end table?

05:51.819 --> 05:55.022
Fred, stop it!

05:55.055 --> 05:57.257
I'll tell you what, I made a
dinner reservation for tonight.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.959
Oh, no.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.395
Listen, Jackie-- if we're
going to have sex again,

06:01.429 --> 06:02.229
I need to eat.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.869
Fred, I'm just not
really ready to have

06:08.902 --> 06:10.471
a relationship now.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.439
Then we can be friends.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.974
I'm-- I'm not
ready to be friends.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.443
Then what are you ready for?

06:15.476 --> 06:18.011
Well, I was ready
for the sex and--

06:18.045 --> 06:18.979
now I'm done.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.490
Fred, I got out of a
really bad relationship

06:29.523 --> 06:33.961
and I'm not ready to
trust someone yet.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.095
OK, Jackie.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.164
I'd like to go out
with you again.

06:37.197 --> 06:40.634
I'm not going to beg.

06:40.668 --> 06:45.138
Just understand this--
once I walk out that door,

06:45.172 --> 06:46.474
you'll be able to
reach me at any time.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.245
Oh, why can't we
invite him to the party?

06:52.279 --> 06:55.148
We need at least
one decent person.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.617
Whatever happened
to the old fashioned

06:56.650 --> 07:00.854
guys who slept with you once and
never bothered to call again?

07:00.888 --> 07:04.625
You've been through them all.

07:04.658 --> 07:08.696
Ah, the smell of dead
cows and onions, I'm home.

07:08.729 --> 07:09.963
JACKIE: Hey, it's
good to see you!

07:09.997 --> 07:10.864
Hey hey hey!

07:10.898 --> 07:12.265
I get the first hug.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.667
I'm the one that
gave up cigarettes

07:13.701 --> 07:15.135
and alcohol for four months.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.943
So what's happening with
the big gal on campus?

07:22.976 --> 07:25.679
Well, Biff and Todd invited
me the Sigma Chi Dance,

07:25.713 --> 07:28.415
but it was the same time
as the Tri Delta Formal.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.983
So I spent all my
drink beer bongs

07:30.017 --> 07:32.019
and finally passed out
on Beta Gamma's lawn,

07:32.052 --> 07:35.789
I slept right
through the big game.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.558
Ah, that takes me back.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.329
What's she doing here?

07:42.362 --> 07:44.364
You said David wasn't
going to be around.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.332
Oh.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.466
I thought you meant
David Cassidy.

07:51.338 --> 07:55.943
I know how much you hate him.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.478
Oh, so this was your little
plan to get us in the same room

07:58.512 --> 07:59.847
and then we'd just
make up just like that

07:59.880 --> 08:01.048
and everything would be great.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.150
Actually, my plan
was that you would

08:03.183 --> 08:07.387
come home and figure out my plan
and then be all mad about it.

08:07.420 --> 08:10.223
And you fell for it.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.358
I'm going back to school.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.593
No you're not,
cause I'm not giving

08:12.626 --> 08:14.595
you any bus money till Sunday.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.030
For the next two days, we are
all going to pretend that we

08:17.064 --> 08:21.401
are one happy, happy family.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.503
Bite it big time,
high school boy.

08:23.537 --> 08:26.306
Shove it.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.276
Oh, I just love it when
a plan comes together.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.622
What are you doing here?

08:41.655 --> 08:44.324
I'm-- sick.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.225
[coughs]

08:46.760 --> 08:49.262
Oh, so you're
skipping school, huh?

08:49.296 --> 08:50.163
Darlene!

08:50.197 --> 08:51.331
Please don't Mom!

08:51.364 --> 08:52.465
Please!

08:52.499 --> 08:53.601
Quit begging.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.068
The last thing I want
to do is help her out.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.737
But she's going to know
what's going on the minute

08:56.770 --> 08:59.006
she waddles through that door.

08:59.039 --> 08:59.940
How come?

08:59.973 --> 09:01.541
Clues, bonehead.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.377
Mom monitors the chips.

09:04.411 --> 09:05.345
No, see--

09:05.378 --> 09:07.547
I put these back in the cabinet.

09:07.581 --> 09:10.818
And before she finds them, I
say, who ate all the chips?

09:10.851 --> 09:13.887
And then Mom thinks Dad ate
them and Dad thinks Mom did,

09:13.921 --> 09:17.157
and then they get to big fight.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.058
Good one, Deej.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.627
Have you written a note yet?

09:19.660 --> 09:22.529
Yep.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.897
Nice crumpling.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.833
Detracts from the handwriting
yet leaves the note legible.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.905
D.J., the signature is pathetic.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.373
What's wrong with it?

09:33.406 --> 09:35.776
Well, Mom can usually sign
her name without erasing

09:35.809 --> 09:36.576
a bunch of times.

09:40.413 --> 09:45.619
Look, here's how
Mom signs her name.

09:45.653 --> 09:49.489
Now take this upstairs and
practice for a couple hours.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.891
A couple of hours?

09:50.924 --> 09:53.593
I might as well be in school!

09:53.627 --> 09:55.729
Well yeah, but unlike what
you learned in sixth grade,

09:55.763 --> 10:00.167
forgery is a skill you can
use the rest of your life.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.568
Hey Darlene.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.904
How come you're
being so nice to me?

10:03.937 --> 10:06.239
All right, you're
wise to be suspicious.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.608
But you see, the enemy
of my enemy is my friend,

10:08.642 --> 10:09.442
grasshopper.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.484
Hey.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.086
Hey, what's for dinner?

10:19.119 --> 10:21.321
Well, because it's
Darlene's first night back,

10:21.354 --> 10:25.192
I'm making vegetarian lasagna.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.628
Don't worry, I use meat.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.731
Now don't hold that too
close to your crotch,

10:30.764 --> 10:33.066
we're trying to have a baby.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.035
What happened to the chips?

10:35.068 --> 10:36.236
Dan, did you eat the chips?

10:36.269 --> 10:37.137
I didn't eat the chips!

10:37.170 --> 10:39.707
Well I didn't eat them!

10:39.740 --> 10:43.243
This is the exact same chip
fight we had yesterday!

10:43.276 --> 10:44.745
Yeah, cause you
called me a hog.

10:44.778 --> 10:47.715
Well, then you
called me a cow.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.783
But didn't D.J.
start the whole thing?

10:52.619 --> 10:55.288
I ate the chips.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.824
Oh, well that's
just great, Darlene.

10:56.857 --> 11:01.528
Now we're not going to have a
crunchy crust on the lasagna.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.430
But whoever ate the chips
has to set the table.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.368
Hey Darlene, need some help?

11:08.401 --> 11:10.771
D.J., don't tease your sister.

11:10.804 --> 11:11.671
Yeah, Deej.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.106
You want to grab the silverware?

11:13.140 --> 11:15.642
OK.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.877
Dan.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.079
Dan, come quick.

11:19.112 --> 11:22.015
Something's wrong
with the children.

11:22.049 --> 11:25.052
Hey D.J., forks
go on the left.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.387
They way I remember
is that fork and left

11:27.420 --> 11:30.123
both have four letters.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.158
Cool.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.761
Ohh, I'ma scared,
Rosey, I'ma scared!

11:48.041 --> 11:50.243
Hello?

11:50.277 --> 11:53.313
Uh, Mrs. Conner
doesn't live here.

11:53.346 --> 11:58.585
You need to call next door.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.320
Darlene!

12:00.353 --> 12:01.354
What?

12:01.388 --> 12:03.356
That was my school,
I think they know.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.258
Well how many days
did you miss last week?

12:05.292 --> 12:07.795
Five.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.897
Brilliant, D.J. Don't you
know if you miss a whole week,

12:09.930 --> 12:11.298
they always check?

12:11.331 --> 12:12.199
I know!

12:12.232 --> 12:13.266
What am I going to do?

12:13.300 --> 12:14.935
He shouldn't be
skipping school, Darlene.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.037
If your mother asked me,
I'm not going to lie to her.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.238
Fine, be a wimp.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.073
You know, Darlene, the
whole time I was with you,

12:20.107 --> 12:21.174
I was a wimp.
Now I'm strong.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.213
It's too bad you picked
such a stupid thing

12:26.246 --> 12:27.480
to be strong about.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.416
You're just mad because
you can't control me anymore.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.484
I don't know why I ever
even bothered to control you.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.786
Well if you think
that I'm going to--

12:32.820 --> 12:33.686
[phone rings]
- Ahh!

12:37.757 --> 12:40.227
Way to keep your cool, Deej.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.194
Hello?

12:41.228 --> 12:43.763
Yeah, this is Mrs. Conner.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.332
Yeah, D.J.'s been real sick.

12:45.365 --> 12:48.235
It's-- it's some
sort of stomach bug.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.137
We've all got it.

12:50.170 --> 12:54.574
Well, I feel like I've
got to throw up right now.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.542
No, it's all right.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.810
It's a cordless,
you can come along.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.819
See?

13:05.853 --> 13:06.719
Yeah!

13:06.753 --> 13:07.554
Sucker.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.058
Careful, Deej.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.025
He's strong now.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.468
I don't like delivering
In this part of town,

13:21.501 --> 13:22.903
there's some scary
types down there.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.671
Yeah, well if you
see D.J. down there,

13:24.704 --> 13:27.374
tell him to be home by 6:00.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.409
Figure out what
he's up to yet?

13:29.442 --> 13:30.610
No, not yet.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.779
This one is going to take
some thought, you know?

13:32.812 --> 13:36.583
He's working with a
professional this time.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.818
Darlene's just getting
back at your pathetic plan

13:38.852 --> 13:40.820
to get her and David
together again.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.555
Pathetic?

13:42.589 --> 13:44.691
I'll tell you what's pathetic--

13:44.724 --> 13:46.960
a 37-year-old delivery girl.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.063
Fine!

13:50.097 --> 13:51.431
Then you take it!

13:51.464 --> 13:52.565
Fine, I will!

13:52.599 --> 13:56.236
And then you can wait
on Fred, here he comes.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.537
Send him after me
and I swear, I'll

13:57.570 --> 14:00.673
hit him with a bag of buns.

14:00.707 --> 14:01.641
Hey.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.011
Hey, Fred.

14:04.044 --> 14:07.814
Roseanne, I heard Jackie's
having a housewarming party.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.682
I really need you
to get me invited.

14:09.716 --> 14:10.918
Well, I don't know, Fred.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.786
It's really not my
style to interfere

14:13.820 --> 14:16.489
in other people's lives.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.390
Come on, Roseanne.

14:17.424 --> 14:18.758
I need you on my side, here.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.494
I'd be so grateful if
you could help me out.

14:21.528 --> 14:27.634
Grateful enough to buy
Jackie a really nice gift?

14:27.667 --> 14:28.535
What do you mean?

14:28.568 --> 14:29.802
Like jewelry?

14:29.836 --> 14:32.372
Yeah, yeah, like,
you know, jewelry.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.475
Or a microwave.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.777
A microwave?

14:37.810 --> 14:41.814
I guess you don't know
beans about women, huh, Fred?

14:41.848 --> 14:45.052
See, uh, this early in
the relationship, jewelry

14:45.085 --> 14:49.856
would kind of say, here I
am, I plan to smother you.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.260
Whereas a microwave kind
of goes like, I like you,

14:53.293 --> 14:54.227
let's have some popcorn!

14:56.997 --> 14:58.198
So what kind of
a microwave did

14:58.231 --> 15:00.767
you have in mind for Jackie?

15:00.800 --> 15:04.604
Well, she's a single gal,
so she'll need a big one.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.110
Got it.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.845
Hey, Fred-- how
would you like to come

15:12.879 --> 15:15.148
to Jackie's housewarming party?

15:15.182 --> 15:17.817
Why Roseanne, I'd love to.

15:17.850 --> 15:21.921
You know, it's been a pleasure
doing business with you, Fred.

15:21.955 --> 15:25.092
You know what, if you hurry,
you might catch Jackie out back.

15:25.125 --> 15:25.993
Really?

15:26.026 --> 15:27.460
Thanks.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.530
Watch out for buns.

15:30.563 --> 15:31.631
Hello, Roseanne.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.633
I hope I'm not bothering
you, I know how busy

15:33.666 --> 15:34.901
you can get planning a party.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.376
What party?

15:43.410 --> 15:45.478
Oh, why Mom, certainly
you haven't forgotten

15:45.512 --> 15:47.814
the happy, happy family
surprise party we're throwing

15:47.847 --> 15:49.516
for Jackie's housewarming?

15:49.549 --> 15:51.684
I suppose I know
why I wasn't invited,

15:51.718 --> 15:53.920
I already gave my gift--

15:53.953 --> 15:56.489
the house.

15:56.523 --> 15:59.826
Well, uh, Mom, see--

15:59.859 --> 16:01.328
OK.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.495
All right, I'll tell you.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.398
It's not just a housewarming
party for Jackie,

16:05.432 --> 16:07.834
it was also going
to be a surprise

16:07.867 --> 16:10.870
thank you party
for you for lending

16:10.903 --> 16:12.772
Jackie the downpayment money.

16:12.805 --> 16:13.806
It is?

16:13.840 --> 16:16.043
Yes, but Darlene
wrecked the surprise

16:16.076 --> 16:18.378
and nearly ruined our
happy, happy family.

16:22.015 --> 16:26.153
Oh Roseanne, I'm sorry,
but I don't want a big party.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.754
Well, it's too late.

16:27.787 --> 16:31.291
But I'll be embarrassed if
everyone buys me a present!

16:31.324 --> 16:33.926
Well, I can take care of that.

16:33.960 --> 16:34.961
BEVERLY: This is so touching!

16:34.994 --> 16:38.898
I Don't know what to say!

16:38.931 --> 16:39.932
Well, see you Sunday.

16:46.306 --> 16:49.576
So-- I guess now
the score is even,

16:49.609 --> 16:51.978
things can get back to normal.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.914
Now you can rat out
your little brother.

16:54.947 --> 16:59.286
Come on D.J., let's go
to the movies, my treat.

16:59.319 --> 17:05.058
D.J. Here's the deal--

17:05.092 --> 17:08.128
you tell me what rotten
thing you're up to

17:08.161 --> 17:13.966
and I will punish Darlene
and buy you ice cream.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.368
Don't look at Darlene.

17:20.407 --> 17:23.643
I haven't been up to anything.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.612
- After you, Deej.
- Thanks, sis.

17:33.353 --> 17:37.657
D.J., look what I
found in the garbage.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.426
So?

17:39.459 --> 17:41.027
I told you I didn't like it.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.129
I bought my lunch.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.096
Yeah?

17:43.130 --> 17:45.031
Well I saw you
leave home with it.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.500
So I came back
and threw it away.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.770
I didn't want anybody to
see me with that stupid bag.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.106
Good one.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.774
It's the truth.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.843
You know, you think that
Darlene's helping you out,

17:56.876 --> 17:57.810
but she really isn't.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.779
She's telling me everything.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.815
This whole thing is
just a big plan that we

18:02.849 --> 18:04.417
worked out to set you up.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.018
No it isn't.

18:06.052 --> 18:07.254
How can you be sure?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.189
Because Darlene told
me you'd say that.

18:18.064 --> 18:18.865
Damn.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.738
David, you're not
a blood relative,

18:25.772 --> 18:30.643
I think you may have an
honest gene left in your body.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.412
What's going on with D.J.?

18:32.445 --> 18:36.316
I don't know
anything, Mrs. Conner.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.952
Very impressive, Darlene.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.454
Very impressive.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.893
I saw what just happened.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.261
Thanks.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.430
Well, I didn't do it
because you wanted me to,

18:50.463 --> 18:52.365
I did it because I'm
mad at your mother.

18:52.399 --> 18:55.001
Besides, lying just seemed
like the right thing to do.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.040
It usually is.

19:01.073 --> 19:02.575
Watch out, Darlene,
you said something to me

19:02.609 --> 19:03.843
without an insult.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.379
Yeah, I'm tired.

19:06.413 --> 19:10.483
You know, I'm
not seeing anybody.

19:10.517 --> 19:11.784
Are you?

19:11.818 --> 19:12.619
Nah.

19:16.623 --> 19:20.427
Although I am sleeping
with several people.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.528
You are?

19:21.561 --> 19:26.233
Yeah, mostly professors,
mostly for grades.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.067
Heh.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.969
I miss you, Darlene.

19:30.002 --> 19:30.803
Good.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.609
Are we making up?

19:36.643 --> 19:39.045
I hope so.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.913
OK, but just don't tell
Mom, I don't want her to think

19:40.947 --> 19:42.882
her little plan worked.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.618
You're not asking me
to lie again, are you?

19:45.652 --> 19:46.553
No.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.289
I'm telling you to.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.122
We're back.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.730
[phone ringing]

19:58.398 --> 19:59.266
Hello?

19:59.299 --> 20:02.269
Yes, this is Mrs. Conner.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.971
No he hasn't been able to
make it, he's been very sick.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.681
Don't mess with
the master, Darlene.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.360
You guys are in so much
trouble, I'm going to make

20:27.394 --> 20:30.830
you wish I was never born.

20:30.863 --> 20:34.601
Oh, and by the way, I know that
you and David made up, too.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.403
How did you find out?

20:36.436 --> 20:37.236
You just told me.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.450
D.J., come on, I'm
walking you to school today.

20:50.483 --> 20:54.387
Oh no, you're not
going in that are you?

20:54.421 --> 20:57.590
Oh no, D.J., I
wouldn't do that to you.

20:57.624 --> 21:01.661
But I would do this.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.902
Oh, oh, oh, oh
my, just a minute.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.438
Wait one minute, here.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.840
This is for when I
kiss you goodbye.

21:28.187 --> 21:30.056
OK, come on, we need to hurry!

21:30.089 --> 21:31.624
Cause I've got to
make it up to Chicago

21:31.658 --> 21:34.327
to surprise your sister.

21:34.361 --> 21:37.630
[theme song]
