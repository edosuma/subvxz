WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:08.908 --> 00:11.411
Last time around we got two new boys.

00:12.812 --> 00:14.614
I'm too hot.
Oi, oi!

00:14.681 --> 00:16.015
Oh, my God.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.817
It's my best friend, Kyle.

00:17.884 --> 00:20.053
Marnie and Gary got together.

00:21.788 --> 00:24.157
Then she decided
that she fancied Aaron.

00:25.992 --> 00:28.895
I started off being sassy
and ended up being a slut.

00:29.796 --> 00:31.598
I gave Holly the ride of her life.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.503
Gaz fucked over me and Scott.

00:36.569 --> 00:38.805
I would never do that to you!

00:38.872 --> 00:42.342
Gary necked on with Vicky!

00:42.409 --> 00:43.777
(screams)

00:43.843 --> 00:45.445
Vicky, tick!
(laughs)

00:45.512 --> 00:48.248
Me and Charlotte finally
got back to being friends.

00:48.314 --> 00:49.749
I feel like we should hug.

00:53.086 --> 00:57.323
Not even Mystic fucking Meg
can predict what's gonna happen!

00:57.390 --> 01:00.427
We're back and things are about
to get fucking naughty!

01:02.929 --> 01:06.533
This time around
it's going to be bigger...

01:06.599 --> 01:08.268
...and better than before.

01:08.334 --> 01:11.037
(cheering)

01:11.104 --> 01:12.806
Come on.
(yells)

01:12.872 --> 01:14.808
There's gonna be more kissing.

01:16.476 --> 01:17.744
Getting fucked up.

01:19.612 --> 01:20.814
Banging birds.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.350
Tears.

01:25.852 --> 01:28.688
Arguing.
(shouting)

01:28.755 --> 01:30.223
I didn't fucking know!

01:30.290 --> 01:32.325
Fighting.

01:32.392 --> 01:34.360
(shouting)

01:34.427 --> 01:36.296
You fucking tramp.

01:36.362 --> 01:38.264
More of absolutely everything!

01:38.331 --> 01:40.733
(screams, laughs)

01:46.372 --> 01:48.875
I'm not going to get myself
into any trouble.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.480
(screams)

01:53.546 --> 01:55.048
(both laugh)

01:56.115 --> 01:59.118
It feels so good to be back
with this bunch of bellends.

02:01.321 --> 02:04.357
Cheery, party crew.
Bring it on.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.294
Awkward!

02:08.360 --> 02:10.096
Can someone open the door?

02:11.831 --> 02:13.967
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:14.033 --> 02:16.135
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.571
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.907
Get me in this house,
I'm gonna tear it up.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.742
I'd never kiss without a six pack.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.777
The hardest graft I do is my hair.

02:24.844 --> 02:26.846
I'm colourful and full of mischief.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.681
I'm fake, flirty, I've got FFs.

02:28.748 --> 02:31.651
I'm gonna make sparks fly
and get everyone feisty.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.920
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:41.127 --> 02:46.065
This is it, the day we're going back
in the house. I am so excited.

02:46.132 --> 02:48.234
I'm buzzing to be back.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.304
I can't fucking wait.

02:52.405 --> 02:54.040
(screams)

02:54.107 --> 02:55.775
(car horn)

02:55.842 --> 02:57.010
You ready?
Aye.

02:57.076 --> 02:59.445
Gaz pulls up in a Ferrari,
let's fucking go!

03:04.918 --> 03:06.753
(car horn honks)

03:08.655 --> 03:09.822
Holly!

03:09.889 --> 03:11.824
(both scream)

03:11.891 --> 03:14.961
This time I'm going in
with my best friend Charlotte.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.329
I couldn't be happier.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.464
Nah, I don't think
this is gonna go.

03:18.531 --> 03:22.535
This is the way it should always be.
Harlotte are back!

03:22.602 --> 03:23.703
Like a boss.

03:30.076 --> 03:31.644
Last time round was insane.

03:31.711 --> 03:35.682
I shagged Marnie and then she decided
she fancied Aaron, my best mate.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.289
I stayed away from Marnie
cos I was a mate.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.358
I won't let Gary tell us what to do.

03:45.425 --> 03:47.527
If I wanna go there with Marnie
I will.

03:50.029 --> 03:52.065
So, what's gonna happen then?
What?

03:52.131 --> 03:54.534
We're gonna go
and Kyle's gonna be there.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.603
Do you think you'll fancy him again?

03:56.669 --> 03:58.838
Last time right at the end
I got jealous.

03:58.905 --> 04:02.241
I didn't want things to get
complicated with Kyle but they did.

04:02.308 --> 04:04.344
I got jealous
and I'm not gonna again.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.879
How's you and Mitch, all right?
We're good.

04:06.946 --> 04:09.582
Me and Mitch are amazing
so I'm not gonna be torn

04:09.649 --> 04:13.086
between him and the house.
I want to get in there and have fun.

04:13.152 --> 04:15.388
So, what we doing now?
Going to the house?

04:15.455 --> 04:18.156
No, we're going to pick Scott up.
OK, great.

04:22.028 --> 04:23.396
Like a boss.

04:26.165 --> 04:28.601
I'm so excited about
being back in this house.

04:28.668 --> 04:31.304
I'm gonna have fun, get mortal,
be with the girls

04:31.371 --> 04:34.140
and I'm not getting in any trouble.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.175
(knocking)

04:36.242 --> 04:39.245
Hiya. Are you all right?
How are you? I'm good.

04:39.312 --> 04:42.081
I'm absolutely buzzing.
I'm not the new boy any more

04:42.148 --> 04:45.018
and it's mint that I get to go
with my best mate Marnie.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.620
What's the crack with you and Aaron?
We left it,

04:47.687 --> 04:49.656
saying that we liked each other,

04:49.722 --> 04:51.824
but the whole Gary thing
messed it up.

04:51.891 --> 04:55.628
Last time, Aaron said he likes us.
I hope he still feels the same.

04:55.695 --> 04:58.331
What's gonna happen with Holly?
I do fancy Holly.

04:58.398 --> 05:01.000
She dropped her knickers
within five minutes.

05:01.067 --> 05:04.303
She became my friend as well as
me shagging her all the time.

05:04.370 --> 05:07.607
If Holly wants another round,
she's more than welcome.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.080
Woo, woo, woo, woo.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.049
(both yell)

05:16.115 --> 05:17.684
It's the police!

05:17.750 --> 05:19.018
Oi, oi!
(both scream)

05:19.085 --> 05:20.820
Hi, Scott, how you doing?

05:20.887 --> 05:23.890
Hold tight because Scotty T
is back in the mix.

05:23.956 --> 05:27.160
How you doing? Have you missed us?
Yes.

05:28.194 --> 05:33.132
(all cheer)

05:35.735 --> 05:38.404
Yeah, loving it.
Are you? Aye, aye.

05:38.471 --> 05:41.407
No, but, Scott, I'm classy now.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.509
You said this last time.
I didn't...

05:43.576 --> 05:45.812
It was sassy,
you've swapped the S for C.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.147
She's full of shit.
Them fucking knickers

05:48.214 --> 05:51.117
will be launched over the fence
as soon as she walks in.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.986
I'll prove you wrong.
See how long till you break.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.628
(laughter)

06:05.398 --> 06:07.366
I cannot wait
to get back in the house.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.108
Ah!

06:15.174 --> 06:16.909
Hello!
Hello!

06:16.976 --> 06:18.811
Let's go on a mish.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.481
I'm heading outside
to check the shag pad

06:21.547 --> 06:23.950
because Dr Dick
is back on the ward.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.119
Feel my penis.

06:26.185 --> 06:27.854
(screams)

06:27.920 --> 06:31.157
I'm classy now, Scott.
This bed is proper bouncy.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.494
I'm testing the bed to see
if it can handle the Scotty T force

06:34.560 --> 06:36.696
and fuck me, does it make some noise.

06:36.763 --> 06:39.132
(girls whoop)

06:39.198 --> 06:40.767
(all laugh)

06:40.833 --> 06:43.803
I'm scared my pubes are gonna
pop out. Why, are they long?

06:44.804 --> 06:46.005
(gasps)

06:46.072 --> 06:50.476
Charlotte's fanny is kicking off,
it's like a baboon's kneecap.

06:50.543 --> 06:53.679
Scott, they're as long as your hair.
Oh, my God.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.081
And black.

06:56.315 --> 07:00.219
Right, OK, I've got a hairy fanny,
get over it, so's your ma.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.488
This is what a real woman
looks like.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.195
Someone's walking through the door.

07:10.296 --> 07:11.931
Shit! It's a new person.

07:12.965 --> 07:16.469
Marilyn Monroe's walked through
the door. I thought she was dead.

07:16.536 --> 07:18.404
(all scream)

07:18.471 --> 07:20.840
It's Vicky, and she's blonde.
What the fuck?

07:20.907 --> 07:22.608
Hello.
It looks amazing.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.277
You've gone lighter as well.

07:24.343 --> 07:27.413
I'm blonde now. You know what
they say, they have more fun!

07:27.480 --> 07:29.649
It's part of my new classy persona.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.286
I'm actually going to be classy
I think.

07:33.352 --> 07:36.889
You need to remember that you ended
up in bed with Gary last time

07:36.956 --> 07:38.291
and that is not classy.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.993
We thought you were gonna
get in with Gaz.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.629
Awkward downing time!

07:43.696 --> 07:47.166
I'd rather frig myself off
with a fucking cactus

07:47.233 --> 07:51.003
than get with Beadle again.
That is definitely done.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.973
I've actually met someone else.
What?! No!

07:54.040 --> 07:56.642
This time there's gonna be
no tashing on for me.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.879
I've met someone, but I hope
this house doesn't fuck it up.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.848
Are you gonna miss him?
I think so.

08:01.914 --> 08:03.850
But it's early days and I don't know

08:03.916 --> 08:06.319
so I suppose this is a good test.
Test.

08:06.385 --> 08:09.822
The hardest thing about having
a relationship on the outside

08:09.889 --> 08:10.890
is missing them.

08:10.957 --> 08:14.227
I miss Mitch so much
and I know Vicky's gonna struggle.

08:14.293 --> 08:18.464
Who's gonna come in next? It's just
fucking me and all the pussy.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.466
(all laugh)

08:23.603 --> 08:26.138
Charlotte, your car's full of...
Hi!

08:26.205 --> 08:28.241
(all scream)

08:28.307 --> 08:31.611
I see Holly and don't know if she's
gonna run and try and fuck us,

08:31.677 --> 08:33.179
or make things awkward.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.413
Hi.
Hello.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.481
You all right?

08:35.548 --> 08:38.451
Kyle's walked in
and I thought it might be awkward,

08:38.517 --> 08:42.188
but to be honest it's not.
This time I just want to be friends.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.056
I'm not going down that route.

08:44.123 --> 08:45.925
I'm nervous about seeing Aaron.

08:45.992 --> 08:48.661
I'm gutted that Aaron
isn't already in the house

08:48.728 --> 08:50.997
but hopefully I won't
be waiting too long.

08:51.063 --> 08:53.666
I bet any money
that he comes on to you tonight.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.768
I know it's gonna happen.
OK.

08:59.839 --> 09:01.941
(Charlotte) Shit! (screams)

09:02.008 --> 09:03.142
It's Aaron!

09:03.209 --> 09:06.312
Open the day and everyone's there.
It's mint to be back.

09:08.481 --> 09:13.052
Aaron looks absolutely unreal. Even
better than last time in the house.

09:13.119 --> 09:15.721
How you doing?
What about you? You look nice.

09:15.788 --> 09:19.225
It's nice to see everyone,
especially Marnie. She's fit.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.693
I like.

09:21.827 --> 09:24.797
I don't know how to play it cool
when I fancy someone.

09:24.864 --> 09:28.167
He looks really good, doesn't he?
I just said Aaron looks good.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.569
And I'm like fuck.
(bang, laughter)

09:30.636 --> 09:33.172
Hello. Tequila. You all right, babe?

09:33.239 --> 09:35.374
I greet Gary
in the coldest, quickest,

09:35.441 --> 09:37.043
most platonic way possible.

09:37.109 --> 09:40.179
I want to make sure he doesn't
think there's any chance

09:40.246 --> 09:43.249
of what happened last time
ever happening again.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.384
Walking in and seeing Vicky
was weird

09:45.451 --> 09:48.387
cos the last time I seen her
I was waking up next to her

09:48.454 --> 09:51.724
and now she's got a new hair and,
yeah, I mean, it's really nice.

09:54.126 --> 09:56.829
First night. Come on, Charl.
I'll do it with you.

09:56.896 --> 09:59.131
Normally it's awkward
seeing Charlotte

09:59.198 --> 10:00.766
but it feels like a friend.

10:02.034 --> 10:03.602
(cheering)

10:03.669 --> 10:06.539
It feels so nice to be relaxed
and have fun with Gary.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.374
Things are going back to normal.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.210
Woo! Cheers!
(Scott) Cheers, party crew.

10:11.277 --> 10:15.381
I'm buzzing that we got the family
back together, but where's James?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.850
Where is James?
He's the last one to get here.

10:17.917 --> 10:20.920
Enough is enough,
I'm gonna find out where he is.

10:20.987 --> 10:25.157
All right, disco dick. Where are you?
Everyone's in the fucking ken.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.798
Thick bastard.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.266
"You're winding us up."

10:34.333 --> 10:36.369
I'm not winding you up,
I swear to God.

10:36.435 --> 10:37.970
How can you get the day wrong?

10:38.037 --> 10:40.239
This is the most exciting part
of his life.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.574
See you in a bit, chap.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.176
James isn't gonna
get here till tomorrow,

10:44.243 --> 10:46.979
which means we have
to go out tonight without him.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.614
However will we cope(!)

10:50.249 --> 10:51.450
First night out.

10:51.517 --> 10:52.818
Cheers, everyone!

10:52.885 --> 10:54.553
(all scream)

10:55.554 --> 10:56.922
It's our first night back.

10:56.989 --> 11:00.126
We're gonna do what we do best,
go to town and get smashed.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.765
It's good to be back
with this bunch of bellends.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.802
(Charlotte) Right then, let's go,
first night out!

11:12.071 --> 11:14.707
I'm looking around
and I'm fucking buzzing.

11:14.774 --> 11:16.976
It's amazing being
part of this family.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.645
(all scream)

11:20.946 --> 11:25.584
The drinks are going down tonight
like cocks down Holly's old throat.

11:30.990 --> 11:34.727
Holly's looking wicked. As soon as
there's a few drinks inside of us

11:34.794 --> 11:36.595
I'm gonna end up in bed with her.

11:38.798 --> 11:41.867
Me and Kyle are good friends
and I want us to stay that way.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.803
I don't want sex to come between us.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.179
I hope she's telling him
what she feels,

11:53.245 --> 11:56.215
that she's pieing him
and doesn't want to get in his bed.

11:56.282 --> 11:59.185
Pie him, pie him, pie him.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.895
I fancied Holly a little bit before

12:09.962 --> 12:13.732
but now she's playing hard to get
I fancy her ten times more now.

12:16.001 --> 12:19.305
Kyle's face is a picture and
it's got mug written all over it.

12:25.444 --> 12:29.181
Charlotte's got a boyfriend,
I'm seeing someone, Holly's classy.

12:29.248 --> 12:32.218
Fucking hell, what a shower
of frigid bitches.

12:32.284 --> 12:35.888
It's a good thing Marnie's
still flying the slag flag for us.

12:35.955 --> 12:37.923
Go on, lass, you fucking slapper.

12:37.990 --> 12:42.128
Me and Aaron are flirting
ridiculously and I'm loving it.

12:45.231 --> 12:47.399
Me and Marnie get on
like a house on fire.

12:47.466 --> 12:49.468
We're carrying on where we left off.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.740
I'm a bit nervous
about what's gonna happen

12:54.807 --> 12:57.243
but I'm trying to
play it cool with Aaron.

13:03.549 --> 13:06.085
I'm not gonna chase Aaron
like I did last time.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.254
If he wants us,
he can come and get us.

13:17.196 --> 13:20.733
Gary keeps on coming over to us
all the time, like, what the fuck!

13:20.799 --> 13:23.269
I mean, I know
I'm the goddess of attraction

13:23.335 --> 13:26.205
but stop, Gary, you're single
and you're doomed.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.810
(Scott) Tonight has been quality.

13:31.877 --> 13:35.648
If the rest of the nights are
like this it'll be fucking mint.

13:37.449 --> 13:39.818
We smashed our first night
back in Newcastle

13:39.885 --> 13:42.154
but we're all mortal
and it's time for home.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.934
(screaming)

13:55.000 --> 13:57.403
(Gaz) Back in the house,
everyone's smashed,

13:57.469 --> 14:00.406
it's just so familiar
and nice to be back.

14:08.113 --> 14:12.218
I'm absolutely buckled. It's been
wicked, but wuh kid is off to sleep.

14:12.284 --> 14:14.386
Night!
(Charlotte) Goodnight, Gaz.

14:17.256 --> 14:20.659
(Holly) My first night without
jumping into bed with anyone.

14:20.726 --> 14:23.829
Surviving, surviving, surviving!

14:23.896 --> 14:26.332
(indistinct)

14:26.398 --> 14:27.800
I'm absolutely steaming

14:27.866 --> 14:31.070
so I'm gonna go to Marnie's room
and have a cheeky snuggle.

14:37.810 --> 14:41.146
I fancy Aaron but if you like a boy
you want them to respect you

14:41.213 --> 14:42.915
and don't put out straight away.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.091
Marnie's gonna play hard to get

14:52.157 --> 14:54.760
but everyone knows
I like a challenge. (laughs)

14:54.827 --> 14:57.162
(snores)

14:57.229 --> 14:59.965
Tash-on Tours then, guys.
There we go.

15:01.433 --> 15:02.935
Whoa!

15:04.470 --> 15:07.139
I'm showing Aaron
exactly what he's in for.

15:07.206 --> 15:10.175
I'm technically single.
I can do what I want.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.745
Let the fun begin!

15:12.811 --> 15:15.147
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

15:17.549 --> 15:17.750
.

15:20.286 --> 15:20.486
.

15:43.042 --> 15:45.944
(Marnie) So, I've woke up in bed
next to Aaron.

15:46.011 --> 15:48.580
I'm so happy.
This is exactly what I wanted.

15:48.647 --> 15:51.717
I can tell that you fancy us.
What makes you think that?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.519
You told us last night.
(laughs)

15:55.254 --> 15:56.822
You did.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.158
The lads are gonna give me
shit for this.

15:59.224 --> 16:01.660
Oh, fuck off, man.
I'm not even lying.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.362
This is why I shouldn't drink.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.334
First night was get smashed,

16:08.400 --> 16:11.203
just have a laugh and
just fucking dance and shit.

16:21.747 --> 16:24.983
I can see where Aaron and
Marnie's relationship is going.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.485
The same way it went with me

16:26.552 --> 16:29.655
and it only ever ends
in a fucking mouse trap. Snap!

16:32.591 --> 16:34.226
(laughter)

16:36.395 --> 16:39.264
I can't wait to get back
in that house and see everyone.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.368
As if I missed the first day, man.
What a tit!

16:45.971 --> 16:47.506
(Vicky) Oh, here he is.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.174
All right?

16:52.945 --> 16:55.814
James has finally decided
to get out of his pyjamas,

16:55.881 --> 16:58.417
leave his dog and his wife
and come and join us.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.519
What did I miss last night then?

17:00.586 --> 17:01.854
Oh, fuck off, fuck off.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.163
I've only been back two minutes

17:11.230 --> 17:13.464
and apparently
Holly's pied Kyle off.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.200
You'd think the other way round.

17:15.267 --> 17:18.470
Is Aaron and Marnie
in a relationship? Not quite there.

17:21.406 --> 17:24.410
(Vicky) So there we go,
you're up to date, James.

17:24.476 --> 17:26.244
(phone rings)
Phone.

17:28.614 --> 17:29.882
Hi, pet, you all right?

17:34.186 --> 17:35.220
Yep.

17:35.287 --> 17:37.322
What could I have
done wrong already?

17:37.389 --> 17:39.158
I've only been here one night.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.960
Maybe she wants to finger you.

17:42.027 --> 17:45.497
That's what I was thinking.
You've hit it on the head there.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.599
Anna wants to go for lunch
with Vicky.

17:47.666 --> 17:51.370
If there's one thing I hate it's
favouritism in the workplace. Slut.

17:55.841 --> 17:59.678
I arrive for my meeting and I've got
such a bad feeling in my stomach.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.215
Hello, Anna. Hello.
How are you? Good. How are you?

18:03.282 --> 18:06.852
Good, thanks. Thanks for meeting us.
No problem. Appreciate it.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.388
You've got us worried,
I'm not gonna lie.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.490
I feel you're gonna kick us out.

18:11.557 --> 18:14.159
I haven't had a chance
to call anyone bellends,

18:14.226 --> 18:17.496
I've not smashed anything,
I've not done anything wrong!

18:17.563 --> 18:20.098
You're not here to get wrong, Vicky.
Oh!

18:20.165 --> 18:21.667
I need you.
Oh.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.969
Is this a date? Are we on a date?

18:24.036 --> 18:28.207
So, I'm trying to lighten the mood
with a little bit of Vicky humour...

18:28.273 --> 18:30.008
Is this a date, Anna?

18:30.075 --> 18:32.744
It's going down
like a fart in a fucking spacesuit.

18:32.811 --> 18:34.346
It's a lunch meeting...
OK.

18:34.413 --> 18:39.384
...to discuss some
very, very important news.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.887
What I want you to be
is my team leader.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.890
I'd like to put you in charge.
Oh, my God!

18:44.957 --> 18:47.526
I was convinced I was getting
the fucking boot

18:47.593 --> 18:50.629
and here I am,
promotion, new position.

18:50.696 --> 18:54.166
I think if anyone
can keep them in check, Anna,

18:54.233 --> 18:56.468
other than yourself of course,
it's me.

18:56.535 --> 18:59.972
I'm not being funny but who the fuck
else was she gonna choose?

19:00.038 --> 19:04.309
Thank you very much for lunch and my
new career opportunity I suppose.

19:04.376 --> 19:08.614
You're like my protegee. This could
be the beginning of something big.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.682
I'm in charge, bitches!

19:15.654 --> 19:19.057
I can't wait to get back to the
house and let all my minions know

19:19.124 --> 19:22.027
that I'm the new boss.
Suckers, peasants.

19:24.363 --> 19:26.465
Hi.

19:26.532 --> 19:29.001
Hi. Hello.

19:30.135 --> 19:33.772
So in walked Vicky and Anna, and
Vicky's got a smug look on her face.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.307
I wonder what's happened?

19:35.374 --> 19:36.808
Welcome back, everybody.

19:36.875 --> 19:41.079
You'll be pleased to know we're
continuing with Tash-on Tours.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.581
We're expanding a bit,

19:42.648 --> 19:45.884
so as well as the single nights
you'll be doing group dates.

19:45.951 --> 19:48.120
I've got a very
important announcement.

19:48.186 --> 19:51.757
I've decided to make Vicky
team leader.

19:53.759 --> 19:58.363
Anna has dropped the bombshell
that Vicky is team leader.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.198
She'll decide who goes to work.

20:00.265 --> 20:02.868
This is like giving
Satan a promotion!

20:02.935 --> 20:06.638
And she'll let us know if anybody's
not pulling their weight.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.608
Vicky is Margaret Thatcher,
but less dead.

20:10.842 --> 20:12.811
And we are all her bitches.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.881
So I'll leave you to it, boss.
Thanks, boss. OK.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.317
(Charlotte) See you later, Anna.
Bye.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.286
I am gonna milk this
for all it's worth.

20:21.353 --> 20:25.157
You can guarantee if you're on my
good side you're not going to work

20:25.223 --> 20:28.961
and you can guarantee if you've been
a prick you're going to work.

20:30.362 --> 20:33.131
You, obviously, Gary,
on account of being a knob.

20:33.198 --> 20:36.802
Surprise, Vicky's like, "Gaz,
you're at work, you're a bellend."

20:36.868 --> 20:38.437
Bothered! Your hair's shit.

20:38.503 --> 20:40.739
Aaron, you're going.
Sound. Thank you.

20:40.806 --> 20:42.407
I don't want to separate you.

20:42.474 --> 20:45.110
You're taking us away
from my girlfriend!

20:46.511 --> 20:48.447
Aaron called us his girlfriend.

20:48.513 --> 20:51.883
I know he's only joking
but that's made us really happy.

20:51.950 --> 20:55.654
If that's the case, your girlfriend
can come to work with you also.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.089
(laughter)

20:58.156 --> 21:01.226
Charlotte.
No, fuck right off.

21:01.293 --> 21:04.096
Who the fuck you talking to?
I'm your fucking boss.

21:04.162 --> 21:06.164
I intend on being
a really fair boss.

21:06.231 --> 21:08.200
One of the people,
down with the kids.

21:08.266 --> 21:09.935
I think I've found my calling.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.838
That fucking attitude
will not fly with me again.

21:12.904 --> 21:16.174
Vicky's not the type of person
who can deal with this power.

21:16.241 --> 21:19.978
It's gonna get to her head, she's
gonna change, we're gonna hate her

21:20.045 --> 21:23.649
and we're gonna have to kick her out.
It's not gonna end well.

21:43.669 --> 21:46.304
We haven't kissed.
If there's fit birds,

21:46.371 --> 21:48.006
who knows what's gonna happen?

21:48.073 --> 21:52.544
Imagine if you're with Marnie
and Vicky's off with her clipboard.

21:52.611 --> 21:54.479
It'll be you and Charlotte, Gaz.

21:56.915 --> 21:58.183
No, it's like...

22:00.752 --> 22:03.188
Just because Kyle
is getting pied by Holly

22:03.255 --> 22:05.557
he's trying to take
the attention off that

22:05.624 --> 22:08.427
by saying I'm flirting
with Charlotte when I'm not.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.897
I couldn't talk to her for so
fucking long and it was horrible,

22:11.963 --> 22:15.167
so now the fact that I've had
a laugh with her and be normal

22:15.233 --> 22:18.437
it's absolutely wicked.
I never thought we'd get to this.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.640
Me and Charlotte have been through
more than everyone else

22:21.707 --> 22:24.843
and the fact we're still mates
after all of that is amazing.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.845
I'm happy we're at this stage.

22:26.912 --> 22:28.380
What's your plan tonight?

22:28.447 --> 22:32.517
Have a laugh with Charlotte and
watch these two fucking crack on.

22:32.584 --> 22:36.254
Come on then, you useless pair of
sacks. Let's go to work.

22:36.321 --> 22:37.656
I have got my work top on.

22:37.723 --> 22:40.292
Shut the fuck up
or you'll be back on the dole.

22:40.358 --> 22:41.626
I was never on the dole!

22:41.693 --> 22:44.262
You'll be back slicing limes,
stupid slag.

22:44.329 --> 22:46.398
Yeah, at least I wasn't on the dole.

22:52.571 --> 22:53.772
Hello, everyone.

22:53.839 --> 22:56.108
Tonight's Tash-on Tours
is single night.

22:56.174 --> 23:00.278
Let's play some games and see how
many people we can get necking on.

23:05.851 --> 23:08.220
(Gaz) This is Vicky's first night
as leader.

23:08.286 --> 23:11.256
let's see how
Little Miss Bossy actually does.

23:19.664 --> 23:21.533
There we go!

23:23.969 --> 23:26.705
This buns and baps game
is fucking hilarious.

23:26.772 --> 23:30.742
I can't help but feel jealous
watching Aaron with the single girls.

23:30.809 --> 23:35.247
Wow! Go on, pet. Fucking hell!
How could you miss that!

23:36.515 --> 23:41.219
Watching people eat hotdogs out of
tits and arse cracks sounds so wrong

23:41.286 --> 23:43.088
but it's so right!

23:53.965 --> 23:55.867
It's hilarious, it's that shit.

24:22.694 --> 24:24.696
I'm sensing Marnie
might be jealous.

24:24.763 --> 24:27.165
She's got no need to,
we haven't even kissed.

24:35.607 --> 24:38.677
Why would Aaron want to pull
other girls when he's got me?

24:38.743 --> 24:40.745
We spent last night in bed together.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.548
Of course it would hurt us.
We're more than friends.

24:52.157 --> 24:55.093
So me and Charlotte
are doing the sex positions game

24:55.160 --> 24:57.162
and showing Aaron what he's in for.

25:02.434 --> 25:06.137
One, two, three, four, five.

25:06.204 --> 25:08.940
To be fair to Vicky,
her first night was a success.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.409
She's done better than I thought.

25:11.476 --> 25:12.544
Just calm down.

25:16.414 --> 25:20.485
Work has gone so well tonight.
Everyone is tashing on.

25:20.552 --> 25:23.688
I'm really proud of myself
but I'm really proud of my team.

25:31.363 --> 25:34.766
I've spotted a fit girl and
I'm technically single so fuck it,

25:34.833 --> 25:37.202
I'm gonna go for it
and ask for her number.

25:38.803 --> 25:40.605
Marnie is a gorgeous girl

25:40.672 --> 25:43.308
but until things go further
I can do what I want.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.411
I'm watching Aaron get a girl's
number. What he is doing?

25:46.478 --> 25:48.280
He's clearly playing games.

25:49.147 --> 25:53.118
Let's get this right, Aaron's got
a bird's number and Marnie's pissed.

25:54.085 --> 25:55.320
Let the fun begin!

25:56.121 --> 25:59.090
Wow. The fucking sly prick.
I thought we were mates.

25:59.157 --> 26:01.259
Yous are pathetic.
Fuck off!

26:01.326 --> 26:03.328
...Banged her
but told her to fuck off.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.530
Aaron just carried on
like a right tit.

26:05.597 --> 26:07.699
I didn't fucking know!
Fucking dick.

26:07.766 --> 26:10.435
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

26:12.470 --> 26:12.671
.

26:15.206 --> 26:15.407
.

26:27.285 --> 26:30.322
Lads! What's taking you so long?

26:30.388 --> 26:32.424
James is putting on his bronzer.

26:32.490 --> 26:36.227
Scott's been ironing each check
on his shirt individually.

26:36.294 --> 26:39.731
(Holly) I am so fucking glad that
we didn't have to work tonight

26:39.798 --> 26:43.201
and then I realised I'm left with
Scott, Kyle and James.

26:43.268 --> 26:46.237
I could draw every one of
these boys' penises by memory.

26:46.304 --> 26:47.939
I knew this would turn out bad.

26:48.006 --> 26:49.307
To my first night.

26:49.374 --> 26:52.477
I can't wait. Time to show
these fuckers how to get mortal.

26:52.544 --> 26:53.745
Full squad back at it!

27:04.255 --> 27:07.993
Now that everyone else has turned up
it's time to fucking party.

27:12.163 --> 27:14.966
(raucous greetings)

27:23.408 --> 27:25.343
I'm in the club
and can't understand

27:25.410 --> 27:27.412
why Aaron would get a girl's number.

27:27.479 --> 27:31.016
If that's what he wanted to do
he should tell us. I can take it.

27:36.121 --> 27:37.889
Why would Aaron want to hurt us?

27:37.956 --> 27:41.693
He says one thing and then does a
complete other, he can't have it all.

27:48.967 --> 27:51.736
I spot this decent bird
eyeing us up in the club

27:51.803 --> 27:54.639
so I go straight over
and start necking on with her.

27:54.706 --> 27:57.108
Hopefully she's gonna get
piped tonight.

27:59.010 --> 28:02.547
I can't believe Scott the snake.
I was grafting that girl at work,

28:02.614 --> 28:05.784
so why does he think it's OK
to neck on with her?

28:11.289 --> 28:14.159
The fucking sly prick,
I thought we were mates!

28:19.964 --> 28:22.767
Turns out,
Aaron got her number earlier.

28:22.834 --> 28:25.203
How was I to know
when I wasn't there?

28:29.474 --> 28:31.609
Everyone can fucking do one!

28:38.583 --> 28:42.220
Aaron is carrying on like
a right tit about this random girl

28:42.287 --> 28:44.656
but he's my mate
so I'm gonna sort it out.

28:53.798 --> 28:57.469
Scott reckons he doesn't know
but it's bullshit.

29:00.839 --> 29:02.841
He needs to pull his head
out of his arse

29:02.907 --> 29:05.877
and realise that Scotty T
doesn't roll like that.

29:06.945 --> 29:08.746
Getting a girl's number is bad,

29:08.813 --> 29:11.616
but to argue with Scott
in front of us is even worse.

29:11.683 --> 29:14.452
Because everyone's telling you.
(indistinct)

29:15.887 --> 29:18.189
Fuck off! Fuck off!

29:20.925 --> 29:24.095
Scott can fuck off. If that's
the game he wants, so be it.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.638
Maybe Aaron will think twice

29:33.705 --> 29:36.107
when he tries to accuse me
of bird robbery.

29:42.814 --> 29:46.050
Tonight has been eventful.
Everyone's had too much to drink.

29:46.117 --> 29:49.254
It's definitely time
to get everyone home.

29:56.995 --> 30:00.732
I didn't do fuck all wrong and
Aaron is just whinging over nothing.

30:07.572 --> 30:10.675
Scott was a prick. He knew
I got her number. Fucking dick!

30:12.310 --> 30:14.445
(James)
So much for a mint first night.

30:14.512 --> 30:17.148
Scott and Aaron's bromance
is going away quicker

30:17.215 --> 30:18.983
than the girls with a kebab.

30:21.252 --> 30:24.622
We're only gonna get rid of
that tension if Aaron apologises.

30:24.689 --> 30:26.424
Until then, he can keep away.

30:28.526 --> 30:30.094
Tonight has been horrific.

30:30.161 --> 30:33.398
I'm just gonna go to bed, sleep
it off and tomorrow's a new day.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.669
Safe to say my first night's
been eventful.

30:37.735 --> 30:39.370
This house will never change.

30:39.437 --> 30:42.840
We can't have a night out
without arguments and kick-offs.

30:45.710 --> 30:48.179
All of a sudden
it's a battle of the potatoes.

30:48.246 --> 30:51.082
There's potatoes flying
left, right and centre.

30:51.149 --> 30:52.650
Cushions at the ready!

30:56.788 --> 30:59.390
(screaming)

31:04.028 --> 31:07.765
Everyone's proper smashed, launching
tatties all over the house.

31:07.832 --> 31:10.001
This place is gonna stink
in the morning.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.585
Last night was a total disaster.

31:27.652 --> 31:29.787
I didn't expect Aaron
to be the cause.

31:29.854 --> 31:33.057
If he wants to get girls' numbers
then he can, that's fine,

31:33.124 --> 31:35.260
but don't, like,
try and flirt with me.

31:35.326 --> 31:37.862
I thought things were going
really well with wuh

31:37.929 --> 31:40.365
but clearly
it's not the same for him.

31:40.431 --> 31:42.667
(groans) I feel rough, Gary.

31:45.803 --> 31:49.407
Last night was ridiculous. I can't
believe how much it kicked off.

31:59.984 --> 32:02.253
Aaron's not giving in
to Marnie's tears.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.422
He's playing hard to get. I'm proud.

32:04.489 --> 32:06.958
(phone rings)

32:07.025 --> 32:09.327
(Scott) Phone.
(Charlotte) Phone.

32:10.928 --> 32:13.064
Hello.
(Anna) "Hello, is that Vicky?"

32:13.131 --> 32:14.265
Hi, Anna, all right?

32:14.332 --> 32:17.268
Last night was my first
official night as team leader

32:17.335 --> 32:19.404
and I don't want
to blow my own trumpet

32:19.470 --> 32:22.707
but, toot, toot,
I think it went pretty well.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.977
"We've got your first group date
for you today." OK.

32:26.044 --> 32:29.080
"You're gonna be taking
a bunch of singles wrestling."

32:29.147 --> 32:31.983
Oh, my God, Anna,
where do you come up with this stuff?

32:32.050 --> 32:35.320
I'd have thought there was easier
ways to get people to tash on

32:35.386 --> 32:38.823
but if this is Anna's fantasy
boss Vicky's not gonna let her down.

32:40.358 --> 32:42.894
(Charlotte) Today?
(Scott) Doing what?

32:42.960 --> 32:45.663
It is a Tash-on Tours date.

32:45.730 --> 32:49.167
And it is wrestling.

32:49.233 --> 32:52.303
Now it's my choice
who I throw in the wrestling ring.

32:52.370 --> 32:57.542
I've chosen Scott, Aaron,
Gary and Kyle.

32:57.608 --> 33:02.013
After last night's drama, Vicky,
that's nice timing, you fucking egg.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.247
Tit.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.983
I can't believe Vicky
sent us four lads to work.

33:06.050 --> 33:07.919
This is gonna be awkward.

33:10.455 --> 33:12.657
We get to work
and the daters are there.

33:12.724 --> 33:14.859
They don't have a clue
what's going on.

33:14.926 --> 33:17.095
This is a Tash-on Tours wrestling

33:17.161 --> 33:20.365
so we're gonna do wrestling
in pairs. It is touchy feely.

33:20.431 --> 33:23.301
We have to get these singles
to crack on with each other

33:23.368 --> 33:25.403
and it's up to us to break the ice.

33:33.711 --> 33:35.380
Anna's group dates are weird.

33:35.446 --> 33:39.050
How are we supposed to get singles
together in a wrestling ring?

33:44.856 --> 33:46.357
This is a singles event

33:46.424 --> 33:49.761
but the lads have got as much banter
as a fucking pine cone.

33:51.329 --> 33:54.665
Step back because the immortal
Scotty T and the unreal Kyle C

33:54.732 --> 33:56.334
are gonna show how it's done!

34:00.171 --> 34:02.607
Scott and Kyle are showing
these singles up.

34:02.673 --> 34:06.778
Peacocking for the girls
but it doesn't quite work in Lycra.

34:06.844 --> 34:09.947
I'm flirting on
with these pretty girls...

34:10.014 --> 34:13.751
...and then I'm body slammed
by a big bloke in tight underwear.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.388
(Scott) That was amazing.

34:17.455 --> 34:20.091
This isn't how the afternoon
was meant to go.

34:20.158 --> 34:22.059
If you could just see your face.

34:22.126 --> 34:24.762
I'll even hold the rope for you.
Come on.

34:24.829 --> 34:27.764
We're supposed to be
getting the singles together

34:27.831 --> 34:30.435
but I've spotted a lass.
I'm gonna go for it.

34:33.638 --> 34:36.306
Work might not have been a success
for the singles,

34:36.373 --> 34:40.043
but it has been for me. I just hope
none of the lads tell Marnie.

34:42.013 --> 34:43.748
(car horn)

34:45.449 --> 34:47.351
You look stressed.
Stressed?

34:50.888 --> 34:54.358
You just lay back, enjoy the ride.
Gonna leave the beard out.

34:54.425 --> 34:55.426
Fair enough.

34:57.361 --> 34:58.896
Here's the lads back.

34:58.963 --> 35:00.298
(Scott) What you got on?

35:00.364 --> 35:02.934
We've got back
and James has got a face mask on.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.069
Is this what happens
when we're away?

35:05.136 --> 35:06.137
What's going on?

35:06.204 --> 35:08.239
There was three boys
and three girls,

35:08.306 --> 35:10.174
and me and Kyle demonstrated.

35:10.241 --> 35:13.744
They didn't do it, they just
watched. It was only me and Kyle.

35:13.811 --> 35:14.946
Like pansies.

35:15.012 --> 35:16.581
Aaron has not said a word to me

35:16.647 --> 35:18.850
after accusing me
of trying to rob a bird.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.985
If he wants something
to be upset about

35:21.052 --> 35:23.454
I'm gonna tell the girls
what he's been up to.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.362
Aaron's gone and done it again.

35:31.429 --> 35:34.265
He's got a girl's number
and he's kissed her.

35:34.332 --> 35:36.868
He's turning out
to be a right dirty dog.

35:38.069 --> 35:39.570
Everyone's mortal.

35:40.605 --> 35:44.442
He was bang out of order
so let's see how he likes it.

35:44.509 --> 35:46.210
You liar!

35:46.277 --> 35:47.845
I can't bear to look at Aaron.

35:47.912 --> 35:50.748
That's what happens
when you fuck Marnie over.

35:52.783 --> 35:55.453
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

35:57.522 --> 35:57.722
.

36:00.224 --> 36:00.424
.

36:09.534 --> 36:12.770
I've asked Marnie for a drink.
I've just got a girl's number,

36:12.837 --> 36:14.772
but I still want to sort things out.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.208
It's always good to keep
your options open.

36:18.376 --> 36:19.610
I am, yeah.
Are you?

36:19.677 --> 36:22.246
Yeah. I'm a little bit scorned
if I'm honest.

36:22.313 --> 36:25.983
Last night, Aaron ended up arguing
with Scott over the same girl.

36:26.050 --> 36:29.020
I'm that raging
I'm not just gonna let that slide.

36:29.086 --> 36:31.889
You fucking went down
in my estimates last night.

36:31.956 --> 36:35.526
It wasn't intentional
to fucking piss you off or hurt you.

36:35.593 --> 36:37.528
But we haven't kissed or anything.

36:37.595 --> 36:39.931
So I think that you
weren't that bothered.

36:39.997 --> 36:43.134
If he wanted to kiss us
that's not the way to go about it.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.469
You've only got, like,
one more chance.

36:46.404 --> 36:48.973
If I find out one more thing,
that's it, like.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.577
If this is how hard Marnie's gonna
make us work for getting a number,

36:52.643 --> 36:54.979
let's hope she doesn't find out
about today.

36:55.046 --> 36:59.483
You fuck it up again, I honestly
don't see any potential in you.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.386
He needs to know that
I will not be walked over.

37:02.453 --> 37:04.789
I won't fuck up again.
Let's give a cheers.

37:04.855 --> 37:07.491
Right, thank you.
To you not fucking up again.

37:11.395 --> 37:14.832
Tonight's gonna be a mint night,
hopefully without any drama.

37:16.467 --> 37:20.004
We're going to do what we do best,
get fucking mortal.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.073
Everyone ready?
(cheering)

37:30.848 --> 37:34.285
We get in the club and straight away
everyone's necking shots.

37:34.352 --> 37:37.121
It looks like
it's gonna be a wicked night.

37:39.624 --> 37:43.361
Bijoux is banging tonight and we're
gonna get fucking trolleyed.

37:48.866 --> 37:51.502
Marnie and Aaron walk in
from their little date

37:51.569 --> 37:54.872
and it obviously went well
because they're both smiling.

38:00.277 --> 38:02.680
Aaron hasn't told her
he got a bird's number.

38:02.747 --> 38:04.615
Mate, you are playing with fire.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.589
I'm telling Aaron
to confess to Marnie

38:11.656 --> 38:14.825
about getting that number.
I hope he does the right thing.

38:18.362 --> 38:22.333
The boys are telling us I should
have told Marnie about the girl.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.568
What Marnie doesn't know
won't hurt her.

38:27.972 --> 38:31.709
I'm telling the girls that I'm
willing to give Aaron another chance

38:31.776 --> 38:34.845
but if he fucks that last chance up
I'll be fucking livid.

38:42.086 --> 38:44.522
(Vicky) Oh, God, this is killing me.

38:44.588 --> 38:47.258
Marnie's harping on about
how she's in control

38:47.324 --> 38:49.060
and she's laid the groundwork.

38:49.126 --> 38:51.862
She's acting like she wears
the pants, poor lass.

38:51.929 --> 38:55.800
She's clearly got nee clue
he's been grafting another bird.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.385
This is getting really awkward.

39:14.452 --> 39:17.121
All of us know that
Aaron got a girl's number

39:17.188 --> 39:19.890
but we want to give Aaron
a chance to come clean.

39:25.129 --> 39:28.299
Aaron hasn't told Marnie.
If he won't, then I will.

39:28.365 --> 39:31.569
He was out of order accusing me
of trying to rob a bird.

39:31.635 --> 39:34.438
See how he likes it when
the shoe is on the other foot.

39:39.410 --> 39:41.946
Yeah, I know, but
listen, listen, listen...

39:43.114 --> 39:44.348
No, no, no, no, no.

39:44.415 --> 39:48.252
Scott's now telling us that Aaron got
a girl's number at wrestling.

39:48.319 --> 39:49.520
Fucking raging.

39:51.756 --> 39:55.559
I gave Aaron the perfect opportunity
to tell us when we were on the date.

40:01.766 --> 40:05.169
All he cares about is who told us
instead of trying to comfort me.

40:16.647 --> 40:18.382
Why is Scott getting involved?

40:18.449 --> 40:20.317
When does he look out for Marnie?

40:25.756 --> 40:28.025
Maybe Aaron
is still too new to realise,

40:28.092 --> 40:31.228
but whatever goes on underneath
that Geordie Shore roof

40:31.295 --> 40:32.730
is everybody's business.

40:35.332 --> 40:38.202
Right, sack this shit,
I'm gonna find myself a bird.

40:55.452 --> 40:58.722
I'm trying to explain myself
but it's not going well.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.101
Are you fucking joking?

41:11.168 --> 41:13.971
She's swilled us.
This night couldn't get any worse.

41:16.106 --> 41:19.476
I've had enough. I want to go home.
I can't bear to look at Aaron.

41:24.014 --> 41:26.817
Fuck this. Aaron's drenched,
the lads are pissed,

41:26.884 --> 41:29.286
it's definitely time to head home.

41:44.001 --> 41:46.537
We get back to the house
and everyone's mortal

41:46.604 --> 41:49.106
but I'm avoiding this shit.
I'm going to bed!

41:49.173 --> 41:50.474
Night, everyone.

41:52.610 --> 41:56.513
Well, I've been here two nights
and there's been drama both nights.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.684
This night couldn't get any worse.

42:00.751 --> 42:02.987
I'm fucking foaming.
I'm going to bed.

42:03.754 --> 42:05.422
Scran like.

42:05.489 --> 42:08.158
I got this bird
to escape all the drama.

42:08.225 --> 42:10.961
Hopefully in the morning
he will have calmed down

42:11.028 --> 42:13.530
and realised
I've done the right thing.

42:13.597 --> 42:16.066
It was a matter of time
before it kicked off.

42:16.133 --> 42:18.535
I don't think Aaron
deserved to get swilled,

42:18.602 --> 42:21.572
but if he'd come clean
none of this would have happened.

42:27.044 --> 42:30.781
That's what happens when you fuck
Marnie over, Marnsworth over!

42:30.848 --> 42:33.884
I've had enough and I'm not gonna
put myself through this.

42:33.951 --> 42:35.019
Aaron is a prick.

42:35.085 --> 42:37.488
Do you think that's it now?
Yeah, yeah.

42:37.554 --> 42:40.791
There's no way of getting back?
No, he's just as sly as Gary.

42:47.631 --> 42:50.267
(Marnie) Night, everyone.
Night, lasses.

42:51.402 --> 42:54.038
(bed rattling)

42:54.104 --> 42:56.507
I didn't know
if it's this bed making noise

42:56.573 --> 43:00.377
or if it's my fucking power stick
what's just got a lot more powerful.

43:00.444 --> 43:03.914
But nee-one is getting any sleep
in this house tonight.

43:14.725 --> 43:16.894
I'm feeling so horny.

43:16.961 --> 43:19.763
Get me into that house
and into Marnie's knickers.

43:19.830 --> 43:23.200
It's time I told someone
what was really going on.

43:25.569 --> 43:26.837
It's a dildo!

43:26.904 --> 43:30.040
It's my birthday,
let's get fucking mortal.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.709
(screams)

43:31.775 --> 43:35.245
You better watch me,
because I'm gonna kick off now.

43:35.312 --> 43:36.847
Are you fucking joking?

43:36.914 --> 43:39.650
World war three
is about to be unleashed.

43:39.717 --> 43:43.053
(shouting)

44:08.012 --> 44:08.212
.
