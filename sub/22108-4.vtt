Everyone,

00:20.721 --> 00:22.773
I'd like to invite
you to congratulate me

00:22.798 --> 00:24.726
on my new business
venture. Here's my flier.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.358
"Tina Belcher, professional babysitter.

00:27.394 --> 00:30.195
"Good with children, bad
at math, but great at baths.

00:30.230 --> 00:33.148
Nobody puts your baby in a corner." Aw.

00:33.173 --> 00:34.586
It's time for me to go pro.

00:34.611 --> 00:36.054
I'll have my very own business,

00:36.079 --> 00:37.914
and I'll be the first
entrepreneur in the family.

00:37.939 --> 00:41.241
- Um, we own a family business, but...
- Right.

00:41.266 --> 00:42.383
- Yeah.
- What is it?

00:42.407 --> 00:44.867
- Never mind.
- Wait a minute, did this all come about

00:44.892 --> 00:46.758
because we watched Sound
of Music last night?

00:46.783 --> 00:48.683
It may have had an influence.

00:48.708 --> 00:52.243

but great at having fun ♪

00:52.268 --> 00:54.001

00:54.039 --> 00:56.139
Are you sure you're ready
for the big show, slugger?

00:56.167 --> 00:58.401
Not all children are as
perfect as Gene and me.

00:58.436 --> 00:59.735
I can handle anything.

00:59.771 --> 01:01.671
Can you handle this?

01:01.706 --> 01:02.738
Ha ha!

01:02.774 --> 01:04.040
I'd like to think I can.

01:04.075 --> 01:05.808
- You can't.
- Remember, Tina,

01:05.844 --> 01:07.543
we need you to babysit here tonight

01:07.579 --> 01:09.323
'cause we're using that
gift certificate I won

01:09.347 --> 01:12.481
at the PTA raffle to go to
that hot new restaurant, Savory.

01:12.517 --> 01:14.361
Don't worry, Mom, I
penciled you in for tonight.

01:14.385 --> 01:17.086
I was hot and new once. Now look at me.

01:17.121 --> 01:19.488
And copy.

01:19.524 --> 01:21.557
And copy, and copy!

01:21.593 --> 01:23.492
Just do your job, damn it!

01:23.528 --> 01:25.695
Tina, gah! Respect the study hall.

01:25.730 --> 01:27.663
Yeah, it's not called "copy hall."

01:27.699 --> 01:29.410
It's bad enough Tammy's
trying to distract us

01:29.434 --> 01:30.867
with her fancy new headband.

01:30.902 --> 01:32.746
Yep. It's just a headband.
That's the whole story, the end.

01:32.770 --> 01:34.704
Yeah, you guys, Tammy
doesn't want to talk about

01:34.739 --> 01:36.706
how her parents stopped
paying for her hair dye,

01:36.741 --> 01:38.507
and now she has real bad roots.

01:38.543 --> 01:40.276
- Jocelyn!
- What?

01:40.311 --> 01:42.411
Mr. Ambrose, will you help
me with the copy machine?

01:42.447 --> 01:44.213
Oh, sure, I'd love to.

01:44.249 --> 01:46.749
What are you even doing,
Tina? Let's all focus on that.

01:46.784 --> 01:49.719
Well, Tammy, I happen to be
starting a babysitting business.

01:49.754 --> 01:51.520
Tina, that's not a baby.

01:51.556 --> 01:54.090
- No, I'm copying fliers for it.
- Oh.

01:54.125 --> 01:56.592
That's weird, to make it
work, you have to turn it on.

01:56.628 --> 01:58.094
- Oops.
- Yeah.

01:58.129 --> 01:59.896
Well, who would want
to hire you, anyway?

01:59.931 --> 02:02.042
People who like the smell your
mouth makes when words come out?

02:02.066 --> 02:03.633
No, more like people who like people

02:03.668 --> 02:05.101
whose hair is all the same color.

02:06.070 --> 02:07.637
Oh, no, girls, stop fighting.

02:07.672 --> 02:09.572
Keep going! Keep going!

02:09.607 --> 02:11.774
People will hire me to
be a babysitter, Tammy,

02:11.809 --> 02:13.442
because I'm nurturing and kind...

02:13.478 --> 02:14.922
Things you wouldn't really understand.

02:14.946 --> 02:16.590
I understand that
you're being a boob pube.

02:16.614 --> 02:18.147
Or how about an analogy?

02:18.182 --> 02:21.284
See, I'm a good person,
and you're horrible.

02:22.420 --> 02:23.786
Not a great analogy.

02:23.821 --> 02:25.288
Not even an analogy.

02:25.323 --> 02:26.989
Shh! Girls, you go ahead.

02:27.025 --> 02:28.291
But fight more fun for me.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.094
One down, 149 to go.

02:32.130 --> 02:34.074
Please don't ask us to help.
Please don't ask us to help.

02:34.098 --> 02:35.731
Yeah, my hands don't work so good.

02:35.767 --> 02:37.667
Look at 'em, flippin' around...

02:37.702 --> 02:40.236
No, I... Tammy? What are you doing?

02:40.271 --> 02:41.582
I'm gonna get neighborhood
babysitting jobs

02:41.606 --> 02:42.805
to pay for my hair dye needs,

02:42.840 --> 02:44.351
and there's nothing you can do about it.

02:44.375 --> 02:47.109
Ugh! You're as dark as
your dark, dirty roots.

02:47.145 --> 02:48.678
Okay, well...

02:48.713 --> 02:51.247
- Well...
- Yeah, but it's kind of like...

02:51.282 --> 02:52.826
- Good point, but...
- No, I understand you,

02:52.850 --> 02:54.350
but I just kind of, like, I'm, like...

02:54.385 --> 02:55.952
Well, consider this.

02:55.987 --> 02:58.988
Is this the best use 
of the fliers, guys?

02:59.023 --> 03:00.423
- Oops. Oops again.
- Ah. Oh...

03:00.458 --> 03:03.492
This is the wrong place
for your stupid fliers!

03:03.528 --> 03:04.627
And now I'm running away...

03:04.662 --> 03:06.028
Ah!

03:06.064 --> 03:08.064
Okay, we'll leave you to it, then.

03:10.535 --> 03:11.867
Okay, quick break.

03:11.903 --> 03:13.147
I don't have to throw up at all,

03:13.171 --> 03:15.538
but, um, if you need it...

03:22.304 --> 03:24.204
- Hi. Hi, ma'am. Hi.
- Hello.

03:24.248 --> 03:25.214
Oh, oh, hi.

03:25.249 --> 03:26.449
My name is Tina.

03:26.484 --> 03:27.661
Well, that's not really important.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.318
- I'm Tammy...
- And I was just wondering...

03:29.354 --> 03:31.287
- ... if you needed me to
be your babysitter. - Or me.

03:31.322 --> 03:33.200
I have a lot of experience;

03:33.224 --> 03:34.668
I wear glasses, so you
know I'm responsible.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.670
And I don't wear glasses,
'cause I didn't lose my vision

03:36.694 --> 03:37.960
like she would lose your baby.

03:37.996 --> 03:39.829
Wow, coming in a little hot.

03:39.864 --> 03:42.498
I guess we have been

03:42.533 --> 03:44.233
looking for a babysitter for Kendra.

03:44.268 --> 03:46.335
We're new to the area. I'm Catherine.

03:46.371 --> 03:47.514
- Well, cool, cool, cool.
- I love your name.

03:47.538 --> 03:48.804
I love it. I love that name.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.673
Uh, want to leave me one of your fliers?

03:50.708 --> 03:51.919
Yep, we do. And it is this one.

03:51.943 --> 03:53.142
This is the flier.

03:53.177 --> 03:54.417
No, more this one. Here you go.

03:54.445 --> 03:55.489
Oh, no, I'm pretty sure that one's

03:55.513 --> 03:56.553
trash for the garbage can.

03:56.581 --> 03:57.825
N-No, lot of good stuff in there.

03:57.849 --> 03:59.326
- Uh, please disregard the footprints.
- Or just throw it

03:59.350 --> 04:00.594
- in the trash.
- Not technically part of the flier.

04:00.618 --> 04:02.418
- 'Cause it's from the trash.
- Or don't.

04:02.453 --> 04:04.854
- Belongs in the trash.
- Okay, got it, yep.

04:04.889 --> 04:06.355
Linda,

04:06.391 --> 04:08.557
I'm so excited for you.
Winning that gift certificate,

04:08.593 --> 04:10.092
you give the rest of us hope.

04:10.128 --> 04:12.061
Maybe a guy like me could
win a gift certificate.

04:12.096 --> 04:14.530
Yeah, being in the PTA finally paid off.

04:14.565 --> 04:16.531
Now it's date night at Savory, baby.

04:16.567 --> 04:18.401
Oh, going to, uh, Savory, huh?

04:18.435 --> 04:19.913
Yeah, they supposedly
have a good burger.

04:19.937 --> 04:21.103
Have you heard of it?

04:21.139 --> 04:22.905
What? No. I don't know.

04:22.940 --> 04:24.440
Geez, what's with the third degree?

04:24.475 --> 04:26.042
Um, okay.

04:26.077 --> 04:29.078
All right, so I follow
ten to 40 burger blogs,

04:29.113 --> 04:30.791
and they're raving
about the Savory burger.

04:30.815 --> 04:33.749
So what? I'm just
looking. I'm not touching!

04:33.785 --> 04:35.351
I got it.

is the right number.

04:42.727 --> 04:44.627
Tonight? Uh, please hold.

04:44.662 --> 04:46.695

- What? Tonight?

04:52.410 --> 04:54.444
- No, Tina, it's date night.
- Please?

04:54.472 --> 04:56.216

hopefully... - Please, please...

Okay, fine! I guess we can go to Savory

05:00.344 --> 05:01.777

05:01.813 --> 05:05.114
Sure, yeah, I'm... I'm

We're good to go. I'll
see you at 7:00. Bye.

05:10.788 --> 05:13.556
That's how you freakin' do that, people!

05:13.591 --> 05:15.124
Call us and we'll pick you up,

05:15.159 --> 05:16.725
so you're not walking home after dark.

05:16.761 --> 05:17.993
Oh, my God, Bob,

05:18.029 --> 05:19.239
we should have checked to make sure

05:19.263 --> 05:20.340
these people aren't murderers.

05:20.364 --> 05:21.664
- What?
- Oh, right.

05:21.699 --> 05:23.099
Is there a way to do that, or...

05:23.134 --> 05:24.166
There may be an app,

05:24.202 --> 05:25.434
- I don't know.
- What? Hmm.

05:25.470 --> 05:26.936
Uh, never mind. It's probably fine.

05:26.971 --> 05:28.838
Yeah, yeah, odds are totally fine.

05:28.873 --> 05:30.984
- She'll be all right.
- Look, if you start getting murdered,

05:31.008 --> 05:32.004
just call us. Right.

05:32.029 --> 05:33.576
- Okay.
- And if we don't answer,

05:33.613 --> 05:34.643
we're getting murdered.

05:36.180 --> 05:38.848
Hi, it's me, Tina, from before.

05:38.883 --> 05:41.183
Hello, Tina. Come on in.

05:41.219 --> 05:42.818
We're so glad to have you both here.

05:42.854 --> 05:46.155
Oh, um, me and your daughter?

05:46.190 --> 05:47.423
- Tammy? No!
- Tina? What?!

05:47.458 --> 05:48.691
- I mean, hi.
- I mean, hi, hi.

05:48.726 --> 05:50.886
- How's it going?
- Good. Really good.

05:51.753 --> 05:54.424
So, Chris and I thought
that since we're all

05:54.449 --> 05:55.972
just kind of getting to know each other,

05:55.980 --> 05:57.579
you two could work together tonight.

05:57.614 --> 05:59.414
- Sure. Fine. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:59.450 --> 06:02.651
I mean, we do only need one
babysitter in the future,

06:02.686 --> 06:04.586
so we'll just see which one of you is

06:04.621 --> 06:06.088
the right fit for Kendra.

06:06.123 --> 06:08.423
You should know, our
daughter is very sensitive.

06:08.459 --> 06:10.459
- Very special.
- Ever since we moved,

06:10.494 --> 06:12.894
Kendra's had a hard time making friends.

06:12.930 --> 06:14.997
- Oh, no.
- Yep.

06:15.032 --> 06:16.398
Oh, God!

06:16.433 --> 06:18.066
Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris.

06:18.102 --> 06:20.335
He's been a little emotional lately.

06:20.371 --> 06:22.349
Wow, that's so embarrassing.
I mean, not the crying.

06:22.373 --> 06:23.905
The not having any friends.

06:23.941 --> 06:25.352
I mean, everything's
great. You're all great.

06:25.376 --> 06:27.009
It's all my fault.

06:27.044 --> 06:28.810
It is. It is his fault.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.612
We moved here for his job,

06:30.647 --> 06:33.348
and it's just... it's
the girls at her school.

06:33.384 --> 06:35.083
Monsters. B-words!

06:35.119 --> 06:36.318
- Chris!
- Sorry.

06:36.353 --> 06:38.120
They've been bullying Kendra.

06:38.155 --> 06:40.022
And this one gal, Laurie, she...

06:40.057 --> 06:42.491
She kicked Kendra in her tinkle-dink.

06:42.526 --> 06:43.492
- Pardon?
- What now?

06:43.527 --> 06:46.161
It's the word we use for crotch.

06:46.196 --> 06:49.798
Okay. And that goes for
girls and boys, or...

06:49.833 --> 06:51.166
Boys have a tinkle-dinker.

06:51.201 --> 06:52.167
- Right.
- Obviously.

06:52.202 --> 06:53.835
God darn you,

06:53.871 --> 06:56.605
well-paying marketing
job that brought us here!

06:56.640 --> 06:58.340
Okay...

06:58.375 --> 07:01.643
... let's go introduce you to Kendra.

07:01.678 --> 07:03.612
Hey, sweetie.

07:03.647 --> 07:05.213
These are the babysitters...

07:05.249 --> 07:07.182
Tammy and Tina.

07:07.217 --> 07:09.317
- Hey, Kendra.
- Hey, girl.

07:09.353 --> 07:10.452
It's me, the fun one.

07:10.487 --> 07:12.954
- This is Mr. Boom Boom.
- Okay.

07:12.990 --> 07:14.656
He's my best friend.

07:14.691 --> 07:17.692
That's right, honey. Oh, God!

07:17.728 --> 07:19.227
It breaks my heart.

07:19.263 --> 07:20.573
- Chris, come on!
- We're on the clock, right?

07:20.597 --> 07:23.698
We're getting paid for this moment
right now, right? Just checking.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.245
You know, I was really looking forward

07:25.269 --> 07:27.135
to going out to a
nice restaurant tonight

07:27.171 --> 07:28.670
and being a fancy lady.

07:28.705 --> 07:30.806
A hot, fancy lady with
a gift certificate.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.140
Well, then, here's an idea.

07:32.176 --> 07:33.408
Why not bring us with you?

07:33.444 --> 07:35.343
I mean, you kind of owe it to us.

07:35.379 --> 07:37.345
You won this dinner 'cause of the PTA?

07:37.381 --> 07:39.214
Well, we made you the "P."

07:39.249 --> 07:40.749
Yeah, we made you both "P."

07:40.784 --> 07:42.851
Hmm, Louise does have a point.

07:42.886 --> 07:45.520
Uh... oh, all right, let's go.

07:45.556 --> 07:46.996
But I'm still drinking a lot of wine.

07:47.024 --> 07:49.057
Said the world's best mom.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.493
So we'll call to check on you in a bit,

07:51.528 --> 07:53.168
and there's some frozen
pizzas for dinner.

07:53.197 --> 07:55.030
- Okay, bye, girls.
- Bye.

07:55.065 --> 07:56.731
Bye. Have fun, you crazy kids.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.066
I know we will.

07:59.403 --> 08:01.403
I'm gonna babysit the
crap out of this kid.

08:01.438 --> 08:04.873
Well, I'm gonna babysit a
bigger crap out of this kid.

08:04.908 --> 08:06.041
- Ew.
- Yeah.

08:06.076 --> 08:07.576
Hi.

08:07.611 --> 08:08.743
Hey, Kendra.

08:08.787 --> 08:11.221
Mr. Boom Boom, one of them will be

08:11.248 --> 08:13.048
my regular babysitter.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.217
And one of them won't.

08:15.252 --> 08:18.253
- What...
- Um, that's right, Kendra,

08:18.288 --> 08:19.855
and Mr. Boom Boom.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.390
So this is kind of like a contest.

08:22.426 --> 08:23.903
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

08:23.927 --> 08:26.761
What should we make them do first?

08:28.565 --> 08:30.632
What about a dance contest?

08:30.667 --> 08:31.911
Kendra, I don't know if this is...

08:31.935 --> 08:34.202
- Dance!
- Okay, okay.

08:37.967 --> 08:40.542
Aw, look at our fancy family.

08:40.577 --> 08:41.616
Ooh, I got to take a leak.

08:41.645 --> 08:42.777
Bobby, if the waiter comes,

08:42.813 --> 08:44.246
order me the salmon, but tell him

08:44.280 --> 08:45.947
don't make it too fishy or squishy.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.983
She said the same thing
at the Fishy Squishery.

08:48.018 --> 08:49.317
We were so embarrassed.

08:49.353 --> 08:51.386
- Is everybody ready?
- Uh, yes.

08:51.421 --> 08:53.455
My wife will have the salmon,

08:53.490 --> 08:55.056
and I'll have the burger.

08:55.092 --> 08:57.941
Great. Our chef suggests
medium rare for the burger.

08:57.966 --> 08:59.461
Okay. I mean,

08:59.496 --> 09:00.729
that's what I was gonna say.

09:00.764 --> 09:01.830
Oh, good.

09:01.865 --> 09:03.064
So, I guess, tell the chef

09:03.100 --> 09:05.133
that I agree with him.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.334
He'll be so happy.

09:06.370 --> 09:07.335
Hey, wha... huh?

09:07.371 --> 09:09.437
Be a lamb and put me down

09:09.473 --> 09:10.639
for the lamb shank.

09:10.674 --> 09:12.307
A little shanky-panky.

09:12.342 --> 09:15.076
And when you serve it to me,
refer to it as "shanky-panky."

09:15.112 --> 09:16.756
And I'll take that
chicken thing. Looks great.

09:16.780 --> 09:19.581
Dad, Gene and I are
going to go, um, explore.

09:19.616 --> 09:22.117
You know us kids, so curious
about our surroundings.

09:22.152 --> 09:23.652
Shanky-panky!

09:23.687 --> 09:25.265
♪ And that's how you pee ♪

09:25.289 --> 09:27.490
♪ In a restaurant, bum bum. ♪

09:29.526 --> 09:30.792
Ooh, little ripe.

09:30.827 --> 09:32.360
I think I might have some deodorant.

09:32.396 --> 09:35.697
Mints, gum, lotion, tampons.

09:35.732 --> 09:37.766
A bunch of Gene's old baby teeth.

09:37.801 --> 09:40.268
Oh, I'm not a...

09:40.304 --> 09:41.836
Huh.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.471
Could I get a burger to go, please?

09:43.507 --> 09:44.806
As quickly as possible.

09:44.841 --> 09:46.641
Okay. I'll just take your menu.

09:46.677 --> 09:48.510
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm. -
Just give... yeah.

09:49.546 --> 09:50.546
Okay then.

09:52.280 --> 09:53.741
Hey, Teddy. Hello.

09:53.766 --> 09:55.046
- Gene, Louise.
- Yep.

09:55.071 --> 09:55.985
Big time.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.053
I thought date night got
changed to tomorrow night.

09:58.088 --> 09:59.454
Does Bob know I'm here?

09:59.489 --> 10:01.623
Bob doesn't know
anything about anything.

10:01.658 --> 10:02.958
Ordered the burger, huh?

10:02.993 --> 10:05.060
I just had to try it, okay? I swear,

10:05.095 --> 10:06.735
I've never done this
kind of thing before.

10:06.763 --> 10:08.897
Okay, a few times at a few restaurants

10:08.932 --> 10:11.466
on numerous occasions, but
those meant nothing to me.

10:11.501 --> 10:13.168
And then you walked back into our place

10:13.203 --> 10:15.503
smelling like guilt
and other people's buns.

10:15.539 --> 10:16.504
Oh, God.

10:16.540 --> 10:17.806
Teddy, honey, baby,

10:17.841 --> 10:19.674
no one has to know about this

10:19.710 --> 10:21.042
if, um, I don't know,

10:21.078 --> 10:22.911
you know, a chocolate
cake to-go shows up,

10:22.946 --> 10:25.247
distracts me from saying anything.

10:25.282 --> 10:26.519
Make that two.

10:26.544 --> 10:28.717
And I wouldn't say nay
to a créme brûlée.

10:29.151 --> 10:30.584
Green light!

10:31.255 --> 10:33.021
Red light. Green light.

10:33.056 --> 10:34.256
Red light!

10:34.291 --> 10:35.368
Tina moved.

10:35.392 --> 10:36.925
- No, he's lying!
- Ha!

10:36.960 --> 10:39.160
What's the score, Mr. Boom Boom?

10:39.196 --> 10:41.429
They're all tied... it's intense.

10:41.465 --> 10:44.532
I want to play hide-and-seek.
You guys go hide.

10:44.568 --> 10:47.035
And don't let this one find you first.

10:47.070 --> 10:49.537
She's crazy.

10:49.573 --> 10:53.008
Um, Mr. Boom Boom, you are so...

10:53.043 --> 10:54.609
- ... cute.
- Run... !

10:54.645 --> 10:56.544
One, two,

10:56.580 --> 10:57.379
three...

11:01.652 --> 11:04.452
Pretty good spot. No
one looks under a bed.

11:04.488 --> 11:06.288
Why would you? Hmm.

11:06.323 --> 11:09.224
"Kendra's secret stuff.
Not letters from school."

11:09.259 --> 11:10.759
Might just sneak a peek.

11:10.794 --> 11:13.061
"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Stokes,
today on the playground,

11:13.096 --> 11:15.697
Kendra kicked Laurie in the... "

11:15.732 --> 11:17.032
Tammy? Tammy?

11:17.067 --> 11:18.533
What? Tina, go away.

11:18.568 --> 11:20.735
The office is my spot.
And also, if my spot

11:20.771 --> 11:22.704
smells like farts, that is not me.

11:22.739 --> 11:24.572
Tammy... Ugh! That's strong.

11:24.608 --> 11:26.608
- It wasn't me.
- I found a box under Kendra's bed,

11:26.643 --> 11:28.321
and it's full of incident
reports from her school.

11:28.345 --> 11:29.889
She must have hidden
them from her parents.

11:29.913 --> 11:31.079
She's not being bullied.

11:31.114 --> 11:32.280
She is the bully.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.715
She's the crotch kicker.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.461
That totally makes
sense. She's super weird.

11:35.485 --> 11:37.000
Kendra?

11:38.689 --> 11:40.889
It's his office.

11:42.459 --> 11:43.591
You keep doing that!

11:43.627 --> 11:44.904
I enjoy it.

11:44.928 --> 11:47.095
You weren't supposed
to look in that box.

11:47.130 --> 11:50.298
But now that you did, you
know what I have to do?

11:50.334 --> 11:51.933
Go sit quietly somewhere?

11:51.968 --> 11:53.134
Kick you in...

11:53.170 --> 11:55.303
the tinkle-dink!

12:00.482 --> 12:02.214
Aah! Doesn't lock.

12:02.239 --> 12:04.196
She's... so strong.

12:04.221 --> 12:05.921
She's got bully strength!

12:05.956 --> 12:08.090
Oh, no! That's probably her parents.

12:08.132 --> 12:10.137
- Uh, you hold the door.
- Uh-huh. Great!

12:10.169 --> 12:11.246
Hello?

12:11.294 --> 12:12.860
Hi, Chris. Oh, yeah, doing good.

12:12.903 --> 12:15.103
Yep, yep, uh... oh, you
want to say night-night?

12:15.146 --> 12:16.712
- No!
- Oh, look at that.

12:16.748 --> 12:18.215
She fell fast asleep.

12:18.242 --> 12:19.741
- Oh, Mommy!
- Went out like a light.

12:19.777 --> 12:21.310
Kids, huh?

12:21.345 --> 12:22.978
Oh, goodness.

12:23.013 --> 12:24.613
So, everything's great. Got to go.

12:24.648 --> 12:26.615
Phew! Well, we checked this joint out.

12:26.650 --> 12:29.084
- Seems up to code.
- And we didn't see anyone we know,

12:29.119 --> 12:30.719
so that settles that.

12:30.754 --> 12:33.055
Uh-huh. Oh. Uh, a lady's
going to the bathroom.

12:33.090 --> 12:35.490
- I'll be right back.
- Uh, your-your mom's pretending

12:35.515 --> 12:37.059
to be the bathroom attendant.

12:37.094 --> 12:38.493
It's fine. It's a good date.

12:38.529 --> 12:39.928
And our food's still not here--

12:39.964 --> 12:41.930
I guess 'cause this place is so busy.

12:41.966 --> 12:44.266
Huh. I didn't know restaurants got busy.

12:44.301 --> 12:45.567
I'm trying to get some bread,

12:45.603 --> 12:46.902
but I can't get anybody's attention.

12:46.937 --> 12:48.237
Try opening your top button.

12:48.272 --> 12:49.905
I'm gonna go ask somebody.

12:49.940 --> 12:51.240
No, no. No, Dad, you sit.

12:51.275 --> 12:53.008
Yeah, you look tired. And old.

12:53.043 --> 12:55.110
Kids, let go of my arm.

12:55.145 --> 12:56.745
Let go.

12:56.780 --> 12:59.147
Go back to the table. Let g... Teddy?

13:00.117 --> 13:00.983
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

13:01.018 --> 13:02.651
Uh, what are you doing?

13:02.686 --> 13:04.319
Oh, I was just... I thought I dropped...

13:04.355 --> 13:06.688
I thought I had an earring
and that I dropped it.

13:06.724 --> 13:08.357
- On the ground.
- You had an earring on?

13:08.392 --> 13:10.192
- I thought I had an earring.
- Oh.

13:10.227 --> 13:11.960
I was... thinking of somebody else...

13:11.996 --> 13:13.428
who has an earring.

13:13.464 --> 13:15.697
Okay. So, wait, did you order yet?

13:15.733 --> 13:17.366
'Cause, uh, we're sitting over there.

13:17.401 --> 13:19.034
You could come sit with us.

13:19.069 --> 13:20.936
I mean, I don't really
want to invite you,

13:20.971 --> 13:22.633
but I guess I just did.

13:22.658 --> 13:23.872
Right. Yes.

13:23.908 --> 13:25.707
How thoughtful of you.

13:25.743 --> 13:27.976
I-I-I just got to
go find my waiter.

13:28.012 --> 13:29.177
Don't follow me!

13:29.213 --> 13:30.479
Paper towel, ma'am?

13:30.514 --> 13:32.047
How's it going in there, hon?

13:32.082 --> 13:34.149
Chance of rain, or thunderstorms?

13:34.184 --> 13:36.018
Kendra? Are you out there?

13:36.469 --> 13:38.569
Mr. Boom Boom? You're awfully quiet.

13:41.107 --> 13:42.484
What are they doing here?

13:42.509 --> 13:44.477
I don't know. Maybe someone 
texted them and said

13:44.502 --> 13:47.094
that you said to come over
for pizza so that Kendra could

13:47.119 --> 13:48.836
tell her parents that
you invited boys over,

13:48.852 --> 13:50.485
but, I mean, who would, like, do that?

13:50.520 --> 13:51.686
Tammy!

13:51.721 --> 13:53.621
Hey, Tina. Where's the pizza party?

13:53.657 --> 13:55.690
You invited boys over.

13:55.725 --> 13:57.725
That's bad.

13:57.761 --> 14:00.125
Tina did it, if anyone asks,
like your parents or whatever.

14:00.150 --> 14:02.086
Boys have tinkle-dinkers.

14:02.110 --> 14:04.944
They what? Why does that
girl talk like a gremlin?

14:04.979 --> 14:06.612
Kicky, kicky.

14:06.648 --> 14:08.948
- Uh, what's happening?
- No! Jimmy Jr.! Your tinkle-dinker!

14:11.152 --> 14:14.311
- She's a crotch kicker!
- She's got us cornered!

14:14.336 --> 14:15.755
Quick! The tree house!

14:21.629 --> 14:23.262
Pull up the ladder!

14:24.353 --> 14:25.751
She's pretty scary.

14:25.783 --> 14:28.083
Yeah. She's like my
grandma at a yard sale,

14:28.118 --> 14:29.329
going after our junk.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.719
- And the salmon for the lady.
- Sorry, I'm back.

14:32.744 --> 14:34.778
We ran out of tampons,
so I had to improvise.

14:34.813 --> 14:37.634
Oh. Has Teddy been here the whole time?

14:37.659 --> 14:39.526
The burger for you, sir.

14:39.551 --> 14:42.509
- And your Caesar salad.
- Yep. That's what I ordered.

14:42.534 --> 14:44.572
Oh...

14:44.599 --> 14:46.165
Oh, here you are.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.817
Here's your to-go order, sir.

14:47.842 --> 14:49.842
Two desserts and our delicious burger.

14:49.877 --> 14:52.077
- Uh-oh. - I-I don't know
what you're talking about!

14:52.113 --> 14:53.378
I told you to meet me in the alley

14:53.414 --> 14:54.580
in two hours wearing all black.

14:54.615 --> 14:56.849
Yeah, but I didn't
want to do that, so bye.

14:56.874 --> 15:00.076
Aah! Well, that waiter's clearly insane.

15:00.101 --> 15:01.820
Poor schmuck.

15:01.856 --> 15:04.256
Let me, uh, get that
dessert box out of your way.

15:04.291 --> 15:05.891
Mm-hmm. Hey!

15:05.926 --> 15:07.993
That other box seems like
it's in your way, too.

15:08.028 --> 15:09.928
Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom. Hmm.

15:09.964 --> 15:11.859
Okay. I think she went inside.

15:11.884 --> 15:13.899
This is the worst pizza party ever.

15:13.934 --> 15:16.029
There was never any pizza.

15:16.054 --> 15:18.756
I just didn't expect
her to be such a monster.

15:18.781 --> 15:20.623
I get it. You said she's new in school.

15:20.663 --> 15:22.809
I been there, boy. It's
hard to make friends.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.533
She just rejected them in their crotch

15:24.569 --> 15:26.061
before they reject her in her heart.

15:26.086 --> 15:28.115
- That's beautiful, Zeke.
- Preach.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.045
Huh. I hadn't thought of it that way.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.980
So, what do we do now, call her parents,

15:32.015 --> 15:33.949
- or the police?
- No.

15:33.984 --> 15:35.717
Julie Andrews wouldn't call any parents.

15:35.752 --> 15:37.786
Julie Andrews would march
right back into that house,

15:37.821 --> 15:40.655
and probably make clothes out
of all the curtains or something.

15:40.691 --> 15:42.731
Wait, Tina, you're going back in there?

15:42.756 --> 15:45.372
You don't have to go, Tammy;
leave this to a professional.

15:45.397 --> 15:47.302
I don't want my crotch to get kicked,

15:47.334 --> 15:49.154
but I also don't want
you to win anything ever.

15:49.233 --> 15:50.532
Oh! I'm going with you.

15:50.568 --> 15:51.733
Okay. We'll stay here.

15:51.769 --> 15:53.101
Let us know how it turns out.

15:53.137 --> 15:54.870
No, J-Ju! We're in this now!

15:54.905 --> 15:57.039
We're stronger if we stick
our crotches together.

15:57.074 --> 15:59.199
Okay, fine.

15:59.676 --> 16:02.714
Wait. I know that I've said this a lot,
but this time I mean it.

16:02.739 --> 16:04.372
We should put leaves in our underwear.

16:08.678 --> 16:09.877
It's go time.

16:09.919 --> 16:12.387
Uh-oh. I got twigs in my berries.

16:15.168 --> 16:16.801
Okay. Here we go.

16:16.836 --> 16:18.436
Zeke, I'm scared.

16:18.471 --> 16:21.355
I know, buddy. That's
what makes us human.

16:21.541 --> 16:24.942
Somebody call a lamb-ulance,
'cause I killed this thing!

16:25.184 --> 16:26.250
- Teddy?
- Yeah?

16:26.286 --> 16:28.466
- I know that's your burger.
- No, it's not.

16:28.491 --> 16:30.388
Stop being weird, and
eat the burger. Please.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.856
- I don't want to.
- Eat the burger.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.524
- I don't want to eat it, Bobby.
- Eat it!

16:33.560 --> 16:35.550
- I don't want to eat it!
- Eat the burger!

16:35.575 --> 16:37.828
I'll take a bite! Is this
what you want? Huh?

16:37.864 --> 16:38.996
Is this what you want,

16:39.032 --> 16:40.431
- you sick bastard?!
- Yes!

16:42.402 --> 16:44.035
I'm fine. I'm fine.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.538
Oh, God!

16:47.574 --> 16:49.040
I betrayed you,

16:49.075 --> 16:50.741
I betrayed us...

16:50.777 --> 16:52.777
with the burger!

16:52.812 --> 16:55.212
God, Teddy, quit making
such a big deal out of it.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.515
- I don't care.
- Uh...

16:57.550 --> 17:00.327
- well, I mean, except when you do.
- What?

17:00.352 --> 17:02.353
Well, we do have that
rule in our family.

17:02.388 --> 17:04.088
Don't order a burger in front of Dad.

17:04.123 --> 17:05.790
'Cause he's gonna ask
you what you think.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.724
Then you have to say how bad it is,

17:07.760 --> 17:09.260
or else he gets all sulky.

17:09.295 --> 17:11.194
You turn into the Incredible Sulk.

17:11.230 --> 17:13.598
What? That's-that's not true.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.299
Do you like it?

17:15.335 --> 17:17.068
- Yuck! No.
- It's really bad.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.569
No!

17:18.605 --> 17:19.637
What's the verdict?

17:19.672 --> 17:20.679
- Awful!
- Ugh!

17:20.704 --> 17:22.540
- Awful!
- Tastes like shoes!

17:22.575 --> 17:23.741
Not bad.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.209
- What?
- Get out of here! Are you insane?!

17:25.243 --> 17:26.944
- I hate this!
- I wish I was dead!

17:26.980 --> 17:29.213
Huh. I didn't realize that I did that.

17:29.248 --> 17:31.582
Also, your neck is
weird. Not to pile on.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.584
Where is she?

17:33.620 --> 17:36.087
Tell you what, Kendra, this
time when you come at me,

17:36.122 --> 17:37.655
I'm gonna do some Brazilian jiu-jitsu

17:37.690 --> 17:40.391
- and roll you into a tiny donut.
- Zeke.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.326
Uh-oh. She's behind me, isn't she?

17:42.362 --> 17:43.327
That's her thing.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.428
Hello.

17:44.464 --> 17:45.763
The jiu-jitsu, Zeke!

17:45.798 --> 17:46.964
Okay, all right, I'll do it!

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Zeke, no! Kendra, please, listen,

17:49.035 --> 17:50.768
don't be a bully, it's not good.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.336
The world already has enough bullies.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.638
I mean, we've got Tammy.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.844
Oh, um, whoa, what?

17:55.869 --> 17:57.600
I'm a bully? Tina,
you're the one who said

17:57.644 --> 17:59.644
that I would make a
bad babysitter, and then

17:59.679 --> 18:01.979
- you called me "horrible."
- That was pretty harsh, T-bird.

18:02.015 --> 18:04.315
Just because you have glasses
doesn't mean you're not a bully.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.816
And just because I'm
beautiful doesn't mean

18:05.852 --> 18:07.084
I don't have feelings.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.919
Oh, wow. This whole time

18:08.955 --> 18:11.489
I pictured myself as
the Julie Andrews type,

18:11.524 --> 18:13.190
but maybe I'm more like...

18:13.226 --> 18:14.659
The Nazis?

18:14.694 --> 18:16.494
Oh, no. Is there another villain?

18:16.529 --> 18:17.928
Well, anyway, Tammy,

18:17.964 --> 18:20.031
I... am sorry I called you "horrible."

18:20.066 --> 18:22.833
And I am also sorry that
you called me "horrible."

18:22.869 --> 18:24.835
Are you guys finished?
'Cause I got my foot

18:24.871 --> 18:27.371
all ready for some kickin'.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.939
Kendra, look,

18:28.975 --> 18:31.142
maybe we all have a
little bully inside of us.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.177
Maybe when we think people
are being mean to us,

18:33.212 --> 18:34.545
it can make us mean.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.214
But even if people
are horri... difficult,

18:37.250 --> 18:38.282
we have to resist.

18:38.317 --> 18:39.839
We have to try to be nice.

18:39.864 --> 18:41.786
Maybe it'll bring out
the nice in other people.

18:41.821 --> 18:42.953
- Right, Tammy?
- Ugh!

18:42.989 --> 18:44.321
You talk like homework.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.523
And eventually, Kendra,

18:45.558 --> 18:47.024
when the right person comes along,

18:47.060 --> 18:48.893
maybe you'll find a
friend who's not a bear.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.161
No offense, Mr. Boom Boom.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.897
Do it, do it, do it, kick, kick, kick.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.965
Oh, my dink.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.801
Okay, now I'm good.

18:56.836 --> 18:57.968
Wait. One more.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.637
Oh, Nellie...

18:59.672 --> 19:01.872
So, everyone, I-I thought
about what you guys said,

19:01.908 --> 19:03.407
and I'm not gonna do that anymore.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.076
I-I don't want to be that guy.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.510
- Oh. Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh. Okay.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.012
Yep. And so that is over.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.547
All right. So, moving on,

19:09.582 --> 19:11.582
I do have some thoughts
about the burger,

19:11.617 --> 19:13.851
but I'd like to hear first from Teddy.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.519
So? Teddy?

19:15.555 --> 19:17.321
- Yeah?
- What'd you think?

19:17.356 --> 19:18.689
- I...
- No.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.924
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.425
Teddy, no. It's a trap.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.893
Teddy, don't listen to them.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.169
I seriously really want
to know your opinion.

19:25.194 --> 19:26.309
Uh, uh...

19:26.341 --> 19:28.206
I'm not doing the thing
that I was doing before.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.600
I really want to know.

19:29.635 --> 19:31.435
- No, I know. Uh...
- Teddy, run.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.437
- So why don't you tell me.
- Just run.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.792
Run, Teddy. Run, run. Don't look back.
Teddy, go.

19:34.817 --> 19:36.741
I... I... I... I, uh...

19:36.776 --> 19:38.209
I hated it?

19:38.244 --> 19:40.211
Yeah? Me, too.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.714
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.082
It was... it was...

19:45.118 --> 19:47.051
- it was a little dry, right?
- Yeah, so dry.

19:47.086 --> 19:48.886
The bun was okay, though.

19:48.921 --> 19:49.920
- Teddy, no!
- Teddy! Teddy, no!

19:49.956 --> 19:51.555
I have some really bad news.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.891
The gift certificate
didn't cover the bill.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.726
You still owe $35.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.228
I got it!

19:58.057 --> 20:00.798
- Is this too tight?
- No, it kind of feels good.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.299
Oh, no! It's her parents!

20:02.335 --> 20:04.435
Boys! Turn invisible,
or drop out the window!

20:04.470 --> 20:06.137
- Let's go window!
- Tammy, stall them.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.072
Hi! How was the movie?

20:08.107 --> 20:09.974
Tell me every single plot point.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.743
What was the movie about?

20:14.013 --> 20:16.682
Hey, let's see who can make
the funniest faces! Go!

20:16.707 --> 20:19.316
We just want to look in on Kendra.

20:19.352 --> 20:23.087
N-N-No! I mean, yes. Because
she's-she's sleeping so beautifully.

20:23.122 --> 20:25.389
Okay, no monsters under there.
Kendra wanted me to check.

20:25.424 --> 20:27.424
Oh, she's asleep. That's
good. Shh, shh, shh.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.926
How was the movie?

20:28.961 --> 20:30.761
Okay, thanks, girls.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.597
Hey, maybe we'll hire you
guys as a team again next time.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.781
Well, we did it. And, Tammy,

20:35.813 --> 20:37.742
if we can do that together,
then there's nothing

20:37.770 --> 20:40.148
- we can't do together.
- Boring. Later, fudge-butt.

20:41.307 --> 20:43.307
There's my little Cutie Andrews.

20:43.342 --> 20:45.976
- How'd it go, Tina?
- Oh, nothing I couldn't handle.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.078
Speaking of handles, what's, um...

20:48.114 --> 20:50.080
- what's going on down there?
- Oh, right.

20:50.116 --> 20:51.782
Okay, that's odd.

20:51.807 --> 20:53.903
So that's where leaves come from!
