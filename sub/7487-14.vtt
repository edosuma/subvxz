is impeachment

can fill the post.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.080
And we ask,

09:09.082 --> 09:12.150
When will the people
we pay to protect us

09:12.152 --> 09:15.120
Stop gunning us down
in the streets?!

09:15.122 --> 09:17.055
What about clarence?

09:17.056 --> 09:18.989
Bank clerk for the past 22 years
at rbhayes.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.993
Uh, record clean, taxes paid,
shotgun is registered.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.863
Raised brandon by himself
after his wife, janice,

09:24.865 --> 09:26.965
Died 12 years ago
from breast cancer.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.066
Brandon was supposed to graduate
from high school in june,

09:29.069 --> 09:31.069
Had a part-time job
delivering supplies

09:31.071 --> 09:32.904
For a hardware store
on the hill.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.041
Brandon deserves answers!

09:36.043 --> 09:40.178
His father, clarence,
deserves answers!

09:40.180 --> 09:44.182
We demand answers, too!

09:44.184 --> 09:46.851
Will we leave this corner
without those answers?

09:46.853 --> 09:47.953
Crowd: No!

09:47.955 --> 09:49.120
Let brandon parker
hear you!

09:49.122 --> 09:50.188
Crowd: No!

09:50.190 --> 09:52.891
Stand up!
We fight back!

09:52.893 --> 09:54.893
Stand up! Fight back!

09:54.895 --> 09:56.895
No more black men
under attack!

09:56.897 --> 09:58.863
Crowd:
Stand up! Fight back!

09:58.865 --> 10:00.899
No more black men
under attack!

10:00.901 --> 10:02.901
Stand up! Fight back!

10:02.903 --> 10:04.970
No more black men
under attack!

10:04.972 --> 10:06.137
Stand up! Fight back!

10:06.139 --> 10:08.840
No more black men
under attack!

10:08.842 --> 10:10.008
Stand up! Fight back!

10:10.010 --> 10:12.978
No more black men
under attack!

10:12.980 --> 10:14.145
Stand up! Fight back!

10:14.147 --> 10:16.848
No more black men
under attack!

10:16.850 --> 10:17.983
Stand up! Fight back!

10:17.985 --> 10:20.018
No more black men
under attack!

10:20.020 --> 10:21.186
Stand up! Fight back!

10:21.188 --> 10:23.188
No more black men
under attack!

10:23.190 --> 10:25.190
Waters: Protestors
joining clarence parker,

10:25.192 --> 10:28.126
Calling for justice in the wake
of brandon parker's shooting

10:28.128 --> 10:30.061
By police officers
late last evening.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.963
All of this,
of course, happening

10:31.965 --> 10:34.065
Only about a mile away
from the white house.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.101
It's clearly a local matter,
and as such,

10:36.103 --> 10:38.903
Is being and should be handled
by local authorities.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.872
Even though
it's basically happening

10:40.874 --> 10:42.941
In the president's
own backyard?
Asked and answered. Carol.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.010
Carol:
Why aren't the police releasing
the shooting officer's name?

10:45.012 --> 10:47.879
I need to say something.
You can't say anything.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.080
I'm getting pummeled
out there.
She's right, cy.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.882
It can't look like
i'm behind the curve.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.050
Anything you say right now

10:52.052 --> 10:54.119
Will end up vilifying
law enforcement.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.920
I was on duty.

10:55.922 --> 10:58.857
I, uh, heard
over the radio

10:58.859 --> 11:00.992
That a kid had just shoplifted
a cellphone

11:00.994 --> 11:03.161
From a store on ambrose --
street i'm driving on.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.679
[ clears throat ]

11:04.680 --> 11:06.196
About 10 seconds later,
i see him walking.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.999
How do you know
it's the same kid?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.200
I don't, of course,
not at first.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.936
I just see
he's -- he's -- he's got

11:11.938 --> 11:13.905
A cellphone box
in his hand.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.940
Uh, it's sleek.
It's brand-new.

11:15.942 --> 11:17.242
So i call
into the station

11:17.244 --> 11:19.944
To get a description
of the kid --

11:19.946 --> 11:22.213
Uh, african-american,
5'10", medium build,

11:22.215 --> 11:25.083
Around 20.
That describes every kid
in the neighborhood.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.885
Yeah, that's why
i didn't arrest him.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.953
I-i just -- i just stopped
and asked him where he got it,

11:28.955 --> 11:30.989
And he became hostile.

11:30.991 --> 11:34.926
He said, uh,
it was none of my business.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.028
You think about calling
for backup then?

11:37.030 --> 11:39.931
Uh, i-i didn't feel
he was dangerous at that point.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.900
See, ma'am,
i-it's my job to interact

11:41.902 --> 11:43.234
With the people
in this neighborhood.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.236
I-i like to think
i'm pretty good at it.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.939
So i just asked the kid
if i could see the box.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.075
Next thing i know,
he's -- he's charging at me,

11:50.077 --> 11:52.877
He's -- he's reaching
in his coat pocket for a knife.

11:52.879 --> 11:56.081
And you saw the knife.

11:57.217 --> 12:02.053
And you fired because you
thought your life was in danger.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.221
That is the only reason

12:03.223 --> 12:05.256
I would ever discharge
my weapon.

12:05.258 --> 12:09.194
So, what happened to the knife?
Where is it now?

12:09.196 --> 12:12.897
It must be on the boy,
at the crime scene.

12:12.899 --> 12:16.000
I called for backup
as soon as i fired.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.103
I was first on the scene.

12:18.105 --> 12:21.272
Jeff was devastated,
just sitting in his car.

12:24.978 --> 12:30.949
I just can't stop thinking
about my own kids, ms. Pope.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.955
How i would be feeling right now
if i were that boy's father.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.159
[ sighs ]

12:45.065 --> 12:46.548
[ crowd shouting indistinctly ]

12:46.549 --> 12:48.032
I need you to check
security-camera footage

12:48.034 --> 12:49.267
From all of the businesses
on ambrose.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.236
See if you can find footage
that corroborates

12:51.238 --> 12:53.071
Officer newton's story.
Which is...?

12:53.073 --> 12:55.240
He had to shoot brandon parker
because he feared for his life.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.975
Huck: On it.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.911
What's his name?

12:59.913 --> 13:02.013
The cop who gunned down
brandon parker.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.119
You know why you're here, right?
You know why they chose you.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.087
[ chuckles ]

13:09.089 --> 13:10.889
Give us the cop's name.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.891
Help us get justice.
You don't want justice.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.026
You want anger.
You want outrage.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.227
You want retribution.

13:16.229 --> 13:19.931
Huh.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.901
You're right.
I do.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.102
So should you.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.037
That is a father.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.239
That is his dead son.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.909
This is not your stand
to make, marcus.

13:30.911 --> 13:31.976
This isn't a platform.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.111
You're not auditioning

13:33.112 --> 13:34.245
To become america's
next great black activist.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.947
If this erupts,

13:35.949 --> 13:38.149
If a father is gunned down
right next to his son,

13:38.151 --> 13:40.151
Will you be able to sleep
at night?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.887
Nice purse.
What?

13:42.889 --> 13:43.977
Prada?

13:43.978 --> 13:45.066
What's your point?

13:45.067 --> 13:46.155
Probably worth a year's rent
at my place,

13:46.159 --> 13:48.026
'cause i live
right around the corner.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.028
This block,
these people are home.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.129
Uh-huh.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.229
We live in the same city,
olivia,

13:52.232 --> 13:53.965
But this is probably
the first time

13:53.967 --> 13:55.099
You ever stepped foot
on this block.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.267
Probably never been
to this neighborhood

13:56.269 --> 13:57.969
Except to get grits
from reggie's

13:57.971 --> 13:59.170
Or chicken and greens
off of wade street.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.072
You have no idea
what i'm about.

14:01.074 --> 14:04.042
You're about getting a white
republican president elected --

14:04.044 --> 14:06.528
Twice.

14:06.529 --> 14:09.013
Excuse me if i don't buy
you're a real down-ass chick.

14:09.015 --> 14:12.116
Big picture --
you and i want the same thing.

14:12.118 --> 14:16.154
You're just taking the path
of most resistance to get there.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.222
It's not smart.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.123
We don't want
the same thing.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.059
You want to put it to bed
quietly,

14:21.061 --> 14:22.978
Tell everyone on the hill

14:22.979 --> 14:24.896
That you came down to the hood
and you saved us.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.498
No thanks, olivia.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.099
Your black card's
not getting validated today.

14:37.043 --> 14:41.246
As tension continues to mount
in the standoff between police

14:41.248 --> 14:44.182
And the father of slain
black teenager brandon parker,

14:44.184 --> 14:45.734
Bnc has learned the name

14:45.735 --> 14:47.285
Of the officer
involved in the shooting --

14:47.287 --> 14:49.954
Jeffrey newton,
a 32-year-old

14:49.956 --> 14:51.506
<i>Decorated 9-year veteran</i>

14:51.507 --> 14:53.057
<i>Of the washington</i>
<i>metro police department.</i>

14:53.059 --> 14:55.059
<i>It's unclear</i>
<i>why newton's identity</i>

14:55.061 --> 14:56.644
<i>Was withheld by the police.</i>

14:56.645 --> 14:58.228
<i>Calls for comment</i>
<i>have gone unanswered.</i>

14:58.231 --> 15:00.131
They're turning parker
into a hero,

15:00.133 --> 15:01.583
And we look like the enemy.

15:01.584 --> 15:03.034
These so-called
neighborhood activists,

15:03.036 --> 15:04.569
They're not helping.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.103
Next thing you know,
there's gonna be a riot.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.138
Press will eat that up.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.172
They want a riot.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.941
No, before it goes too far,

15:09.943 --> 15:12.944
I'm clearing out this mob
and shutting this thing down.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.012
I'm gaining control.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.080
I get it.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.147
The other side
threw a good punch,

15:16.149 --> 15:18.149
You're bruised,
but if you strike back,

15:18.151 --> 15:21.986
If you start a fight,
you're just the bully.

15:21.988 --> 15:24.222
There is a dead child
lying in the street

15:24.224 --> 15:26.024
In front of their homes.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.927
What would you do
if there was a dead child,

15:28.929 --> 15:31.262
A child you knew,
lying in the street

15:31.264 --> 15:33.097
In front of your home?

15:33.099 --> 15:34.933
The fact
that they stand in groups

15:34.935 --> 15:37.101
And say things you do not like
does not make them a mob --

15:37.103 --> 15:38.403
It makes them americans.

15:38.404 --> 15:39.704
You hired me
to tell you what to do.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.306
I'm telling you --
do nothing.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.149
You found his name
and leaked it.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.184
That was low.

15:53.186 --> 15:56.254
So is shooting
an unarmed kid.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.962
[<i> camera shutter clicking</i> ]

16:03.964 --> 16:05.997
Mrs. Grant!

16:05.999 --> 16:06.998
Hello!

Susan ross.
Ah.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.200
Senator.
I'm from virginia.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.969
Oh, susan,
it's so nice to see you.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.587
Thanks.

16:12.588 --> 16:14.204
Uh, i've been thinking a lot
about vaccination protocols.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.008
Oh. [ chuckles ]

16:17.010 --> 16:18.142
Just, uh,
take the measles.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.978
When you get sick
with the measles,

16:19.980 --> 16:22.146
It confers lifelong immunity
from getting measles again --

16:22.148 --> 16:23.598
Assuming you didn't die.

16:23.599 --> 16:25.049
But unlike
when you actually get sick,

16:25.051 --> 16:26.584
When you get a vaccine,

16:26.585 --> 16:28.118
You need booster shots
to keep your immunity up.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.088
Now, there's a whole population
of people out there

16:30.090 --> 16:31.990
Who think they're protected,
but they're not.

16:31.992 --> 16:34.192
That is a shame.
It is.
Take genital warts.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.294
Let's not.

<i>It's the part</i>
<i>when i was growing up</i>

17:02.288 --> 17:04.722
<i>And i saw</i>
<i>how my parents were treated,</i>

<i>How they had their paychecks</i>
<i>stolen from them,</i>

17:06.726 --> 17:08.827

<i>so they didn't matter.</i>

She's saying everything
i wish i could say but can't.

Not unlike
a vice president.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.151
Cyrus.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.153
She's a republican.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.288
And a woman
and a minority.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.757
I made mellie
a promise.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.226
Yes, but you also
made a promise

17:42.228 --> 17:43.828
At the beginning
of this term

17:43.830 --> 17:46.097

¶ i shall be released ¶

41:07.866 --> 41:11.167
¶ yonder stands a man
in this lonely crowd ¶

41:11.169 --> 41:14.070
Ours is a country of laws,

41:14.072 --> 41:17.807
But those laws
failed brandon parker tonight.

41:17.809 --> 41:20.009
And i can only hope
in the weeks ahead,

41:20.011 --> 41:22.078
We can begin
to understand why.

41:22.080 --> 41:28.885
¶ all day long i hear him
hollerin' so loud ¶

41:28.887 --> 41:34.958
¶ just cryin' out
that he's not to blame ¶

41:34.960 --> 41:41.064
¶ i see my light come shinin' ¶

41:44.102 --> 41:52.208
¶ from the west unto the east ¶

41:52.210 --> 42:02.819
¶ any day now, any day now ¶

42:02.821 --> 42:08.191
¶ i shall be ¶

42:08.193 --> 42:21.170
¶ released ¶

42:22.140 --> 42:24.107
