WEBVTT

00:06.464 --> 00:08.173
HELLO, MRS. SANDERS.

00:09.884 --> 00:11.428
{\an1}HOW ARE YOU
THIS BEAUTIFUL MORNING?

00:11.511 --> 00:14.597
I AM LIKE A SILKY
WHITE SARDINE

00:14.681 --> 00:16.891
STUCK IN
A REALLY SMALL CAN.

00:16.975 --> 00:22.439
{\an4}WELL, DON'T WORRY,
'CAUSE ROOM SERVICE IS
GONNA SEND UP A BLOW TORCH,

00:22.522 --> 00:25.275
{\an4}AND WE'LL HAVE YOU
OUT OF THAT DRESS
IN NO TIME.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.402
HOW MANGLED
IS THAT ZIPPER?

00:27.485 --> 00:30.196
{\an1}LET'S JUST SAY
I WAS A TAD OVERANXIOUS.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.074
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT I SPENT

00:33.158 --> 00:34.325
THE FIRST NIGHT
OF OUR HONEYMOON

00:34.409 --> 00:36.244
STUCK IN MY
WEDDING DRESS.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.329
{\an4}SAY THE WORD,
AND I'LL GLADLY
TEAR YOU OUT OF IT.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.622
STEVE, IF WE
HAVE A DAUGHTER,

00:39.706 --> 00:41.332
SHE MIGHT WEAR
THIS DRESS SOMEDAY.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.084
{\an1}A MATERNITY
WEDDING DRESS?

00:43.168 --> 00:44.919
MAYBE.
[LAUGHS]

00:45.003 --> 00:47.422
{\an6}SO I'M JUST
GOING TO WAIT UNTIL
THE HOTEL SEAMSTRESS

00:47.505 --> 00:49.466
GETS HERE AND SEE
WHAT SHE CAN DO.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.176
[SIGH]
IN THE MEANTIME,

00:51.259 --> 00:54.846
{\an5}I'M JUST GOING
TO LIE HERE
AND CHAFE.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.514
I FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT THIS.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.147
{\an5}IS IT ME, OR DID
WE HAVE THE MOST
PERFECT WEDDING?

01:04.230 --> 01:06.357
I WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING.

01:06.441 --> 01:09.319
{\an1}EXCEPT, OF COURSE,
THAT ZIPPER. [LAUGHS]

01:09.402 --> 01:12.155
ACTUALLY, I'M GLAD
ABOUT THAT, TOO,

01:12.238 --> 01:14.824
BECAUSE WHEN I'M 65

01:14.908 --> 01:17.619
AND YOU HAVE, LIKE,
ZERO INTEREST IN ME,

01:17.702 --> 01:19.496
I'M GOING TO REMIND
YOU OF THE TIME

01:19.579 --> 01:21.498
THAT YOU WANTED ME
SO BADLY

01:21.581 --> 01:23.500
{\an5}YOU BROKE
MY ZIPPER TRYING TO
GET MY DRESS OFF.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.169
{\an1}I WILL ALWAYS
BE INTERESTED IN YOU.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.087
GOOD ANSWER.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.351
THANKS, MATT.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.812
I JUST WANT IT DISSOLVED
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.188
CERTAINLY,
AND LIKE I SAID,

01:45.271 --> 01:46.356
I'LL HAVE AN ORDER
REGARDING CUSTODY

01:46.439 --> 01:47.524
DRAWN UP
BY TOMORROW,

01:47.607 --> 01:49.317
{\an1}AND I CAN HAVE
A FORENSIC ACCOUNTANT

01:49.400 --> 01:51.319
{\an5}GOING OVER YOUR
JOINT ASSETS BY
THE END OF THE WEEK.

01:51.402 --> 01:52.362
AND I'LL GET
WHAT I WANT?

01:52.445 --> 01:53.530
{\an1}WELL, FROM WHAT
YOU TOLD ME,

01:53.613 --> 01:55.198
{\an1}YOU HAVE
A VERY GOOD CASE.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.533
MEL IS A LIAR
AND A CHEAT.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.701
I WANT THAT
IN THE FILING.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.495
IS EVERYTHING OK?

02:00.578 --> 02:03.039
YEAH, IT'S GREAT.
WE'RE GONNA CRUCIFY HIM.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.252
HEY, GREAT SWEATER.

02:07.335 --> 02:10.003
{\an1}I THINK MEL
SHOULD BUY ME ONE.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.631
OR 4.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.802
I HATE SEEING
MY MOM LIKE THIS.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.388
{\an4}I KNOW. IF IT HELPS,
I THINK I CAN GET HER
WHAT SHE WANTS.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.390
{\an3}SHE WANTS HER FAMILY
TO STAY TOGETHER.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.891
{\an5}THANKS
TO GINA'S LITTLE
AFTER-HOURS FIASCO,

02:21.975 --> 02:23.059
NO ONE CAN
GIVE HER THAT.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.395
{\an1}LISTEN TO ME.
I AM NOT FIRING GINA.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.604
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
SHE'S OUT OF THE OFFICE

02:26.688 --> 02:28.064
{\an1}WHENEVER YOUR MOTHER'S
AROUND.

02:28.147 --> 02:30.066
{\an5}FOR WHICH
YOU GET ABSOLUTELY
NO BROWNIE POINTS,

02:30.149 --> 02:31.359
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.278
I AM SORRY ABOUT
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.489
{\an1}BUT, COME ON,
THIS IS NOT GINA'S FAULT.

02:40.702 --> 02:43.079
{\an1}I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW HOW SORRY I AM

02:43.162 --> 02:44.247
FOR WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH,

02:44.330 --> 02:46.416
{\an5}AND ANY PART
MY BOYFRIEND HAD
IN THAT.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.543
IT'S VERY
EMBARRASSING.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.378
NOAH JUST MADE A MISTAKE.

02:50.461 --> 02:53.715
{\an1}HE WASN'T HURTFUL,
LIKE GINA.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.425
{\an1}MOM,
DO YOU KNOW GINA?

02:55.508 --> 02:56.509
NO, WE HAVE NEVER MET.

02:56.593 --> 03:00.597
{\an5}BUT SHE THREATENED
TO TELL ON MEL
UNLESS HE PAID HER.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.766
{\an4}GINA BLACKMAILED HIM,
IS THAT WHAT MEL
TOLD YOU?

03:03.850 --> 03:04.809
{\an1}MM-HMM.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.477
{\an1}A-AND HE PAID HER
AT FIRST.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.439
{\an4}BUT THEN HE STOPPED,
AND SHE MADE GOOD
ON HER THREAT.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.482
SO GINA IS THE ONE
THAT CALLED YOU ABOUT MEL.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.901
{\an1}THAT'S HOW YOU
FOUND OUT?

03:12.984 --> 03:14.068
{\an1}YES.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.946
{\an1}PART OF ME THINKS
SHE DID ME A FAVOR.

03:17.030 --> 03:21.451
{\an4}AND ANOTHER PART
MAKES ME THINK
SHE RUINED MY LIFE.

03:27.707 --> 03:30.543
SO LAST NIGHT
WAS INCREDIBLE.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.253
YEAH, IT WAS ROMANTIC.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.172
IT WAS SO IMAGINATIVE.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.173
{\an5}IT WAS REAL
SURPRISING,
YEAH.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.884
{\an1}YEAH. STEVE AND JANET
REALLY OUTDID THEMSELVES.

03:39.844 --> 03:43.765
{\an6}[LAUGHS] YEAH, YEAH,
THE WEDDING
WAS GREAT, TOO.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.310
YOU KNOW,
BEFORE LAST NIGHT,

03:47.393 --> 03:50.480
{\an5}I NEVER ONCE
THOUGHT ABOUT
SLEEPING WITH YOU.

03:50.563 --> 03:51.439
RIGHT.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.277
WELL, I HAD A GREAT TIME.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.487
YEAH, SO DID I.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.530
I WAS HOPING
MAYBE WE COULD, UH,

03:59.614 --> 04:03.493
HAVE A GREAT TIME
AGAIN TONIGHT,

04:03.576 --> 04:07.163
{\an5}AND TOMORROW NIGHT,
YOU KNOW, THE NIGHT
AFTER THAT.

04:07.246 --> 04:08.790
YOU CAN CUT ME OFF
HERE ANY TIME

04:08.873 --> 04:11.167
BEFORE I MAKE
AN IDIOT OF MYSELF.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.418
WELL, MAYBE WE COULD
JUST PLAY IT BY EAR.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.921
{\an5}I GUESS IT PROBABLY
WOULDN'T BE A VERY
GOOD IDEA, THEN,

04:15.004 --> 04:18.966
{\an5}FOR ME TO RUN
OUTSIDE AND TELL
EVERYBODY ABOUT IT.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.843
YOU'RE SO BAD.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.470
AH, SHE FIGURED ME OUT.

04:25.264 --> 04:26.432
UM...

04:28.101 --> 04:29.018
CALL ME.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.561
YEAH.

06:36.729 --> 06:40.650
{\an7}YOU CAN'T IMAGINE MY RELIEF
THAT KNOWING ANDREW
IS DOING WELL.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.986
{\an7}I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
WAS SO...SO UNFORTUNATE.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.322
{\an8}PATSY,
HE GOT GAY-BASHED.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.825
{\an8}UNFORTUNATE DOESN'T
BEGIN TO COVER IT.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.994
{\an8}NO, I SUPPOSE IT DOESN'T.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.873
{\an7}UH, PLEASE SEND HIM
MY REGARDS.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.292
{\an7}KIND OF THOUGHT
YOU'D LIKE TO DO THAT
YOURSELF PERSONALLY,

06:58.376 --> 06:59.836
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
AS CO-DIRECTOR
OF THE CENTER,

06:59.919 --> 07:02.964
{\an8}ALONG WITH INVITING HIM
BACK TO DO HIS JOB.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.882
{\an7}YES, YES, I WOULD HAVE
WELCOMED THAT.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.342
{\an8}IF HE HADN'T COME OUT.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.845
{\an7}THERE WAS A RESTRUCTURING
DUE TO BUDGET CUTS.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.764
{\an7}UNFORTUNATELY,
ANDREW'S JOB WAS ELIMINATED.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.809
{\an8}HOW MUCH
TO UN-ELIMINATE IT?

07:14.892 --> 07:15.852
{\an8}EXCUSE ME?

07:15.935 --> 07:17.019
{\an8}OH, YOU HEARD
WHAT I SAID.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.188
{\an8}NAME A FIGURE,
AND IT'S DONE.

07:20.773 --> 07:24.068
{\an7}I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I REALLY, REALLY
APPRECIATE

07:24.152 --> 07:25.528
{\an8}WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.613
{\an7}I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
I AM NOT OPPOSED

07:27.697 --> 07:28.865
{\an7}TO WORKING
WITH A MAN LIKE THAT.

07:28.948 --> 07:29.866
{\an8}"LIKE THAT"?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.659
{\an8}HE WORKS WITH CHILDREN.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.370
{\an7}<i>MY</i> CHILDREN.
AND WHEN YOU ARE
A PARENT,

07:34.453 --> 07:37.707
{\an7}YOU WILL UNDERSTAND
HOW THOROUGHLY
UNACCEPTABLE THAT IS.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.710
{\an7}IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
PLEASE.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.879
{\an7}NUMBER ONE--
YOU CAN'T FIRE SOMEONE

07:42.962 --> 07:45.339
{\an8}BASED ON THEIR
SEXUAL ORIENTATION.
IT'S ILLEGAL.

07:45.423 --> 07:50.178
{\an8}NUMBER 2--I DON'T THINK
I WILL EVER UNDERSTAND
HOW UNACCEPTABLE IT IS.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.847
{\an7}AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
NUMBER 3--
SO LISTEN TO ME,

07:52.930 --> 07:56.642
{\an9}IF YOU DON'T WELCOME
A MAN <i> "LIKE THAT"</i>
BACK HERE TO DO HIS JOB,

07:56.726 --> 07:59.770
{\an8}WITH OPEN ARMS,
I WILL STOP
FUNDING THIS PLACE,

07:59.854 --> 08:02.356
{\an9}AND MAYBE IT WILL BE
YOUR JOB THEY'RE LOOKING
TO ELIMINATE.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.737
{\an5}DO YOU REALIZE
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN
A GIFT YET?

08:07.820 --> 08:10.948
{\an4}YEAH, I WONDER
IF THEY'RE REGISTERED
ANYWHERE.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.658
IS IT SOMEONE'S BIRTHDAY?

08:12.742 --> 08:15.620
{\an4}NO, SILLY, REMEMBER
I TOLD YOU STEVE
AND JANET GOT MARRIED.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.788
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL
WEDDING IN A PARK,

08:17.872 --> 08:19.081
AND THE BRIDE
LOOKED AMAZING.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.374
IT WAS JUST LIKE
A FAIRY TALE.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.417
{\an1}MM-HMM.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.419
HEY, BEAUTIFUL.
COME HERE OFTEN?

08:23.502 --> 08:24.795
DAVID!

08:24.879 --> 08:26.214
HEY, HOW'D YOU
KNOW WE WERE HERE?

08:26.297 --> 08:27.548
JACKIE TOLD ME.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.425
{\an5}I CALLED HER
ABOUT TAKING ERIN
TO THE PIER.

08:29.508 --> 08:31.052
{\an1}WHAT ELSE DID
JACKIE TELL YOU?

08:33.304 --> 08:34.764
{\an5}YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T WE GO
FOR A WALK?

08:34.847 --> 08:35.806
NO, THANKS.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.767
OH, IT IS GONNA BE
SUCH A FUN WALK.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.394
WHY DO KIDS ALWAYS HAVE
TO MISS THE GOOD STUFF?

08:45.399 --> 08:49.111
{\an6}THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH HOW ERIN'S HANDLING
THE BREAKUP.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.906
{\an5}JACKIE DIDN'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.
DAD TOLD ME.

08:51.989 --> 08:54.617
{\an5}DID DAD TELL YOU
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE BREAKUP?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.160
NO.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.496
GINA IS THE ONE
WHO TOLD MY MOM

08:58.579 --> 09:01.123
{\an1}ABOUT MEL'S LITTLE
INDISCRETION.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.251
{\an1}FIRST OF ALL,
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.919
SECOND OF ALL,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

09:05.002 --> 09:07.171
{\an1}DAVID,
SHE BLACKMAILED HIM,

09:07.255 --> 09:09.173
{\an1}AND WHEN HE DIDN'T
PAY HER, SHE TOLD ON HIM.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.425
{\an5}OUR PARENTS' LIVES
ARE FALLING APART,
ALL RIGHT?

09:11.509 --> 09:13.135
IT'S SAD
AND IT HURTS,

09:13.219 --> 09:15.846
{\an6}BUT GINA
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.932
WITH WHAT?

09:18.015 --> 09:19.809
{\an1}SLIPPERY LITTLE DEVIL,
ISN'T SHE?

09:19.892 --> 09:21.936
{\an4}YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
TO LITTLE GIRLS
WHO EAVESDROP?

09:22.019 --> 09:23.312
NO. WHAT?

09:23.396 --> 09:26.274
2 WORDS: DUCK POND.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.067
INTO THE DUCK POND!

09:30.319 --> 09:31.946
{\an3}DID YOU TELL HIM
ABOUT GINA?

09:32.029 --> 09:35.950
{\an1}YEAH, I DID.
AND HE SIDED WITH HER.

09:52.591 --> 09:55.678
I KNOW. I'M A VISION.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.889
YOU ARE ADORABLE.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.934
{\an4}HE SAYS,
TRYING NOT TO LAUGH
AS HIS BLUSHING BRIDE

10:02.018 --> 10:04.895
{\an1}WADDLES HER WAY
TO THE MARRIAGE BED.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.941
OH, YEAH.

10:13.904 --> 10:17.366
I WANT YOU TO
SIT BACK AND RELAX.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.827
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

10:19.910 --> 10:21.829
{\an1}JUST A LITTLE T.L.C.,
THAT'S ALL.

10:21.912 --> 10:25.916
{\an1}OH. WELL,
THIS BODES WELL.

10:29.628 --> 10:34.216
{\an5}I UNDERSTAND THAT WOMEN
WHO ARE IN ADVANCED
STAGES OF PREGNANCY

10:34.300 --> 10:36.594
ARE VERY SENSITIVE.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.721
MM-HMM.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.014
HOW'S THAT?

10:40.097 --> 10:41.140
[LAUGHS]

10:43.976 --> 10:45.895
DO YOU SMELL SOMETHING?

10:45.978 --> 10:47.438
JUST FEET. [LAUGHS]

10:48.689 --> 10:50.900
OH, THE CANDLES.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.568
I GOT US
A SMOKY SCENTED ONE

10:52.651 --> 10:54.070
{\an3}TO REMIND US
OF THE CAMPING TRIP.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.237
[SIGH]

10:55.321 --> 10:56.405
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

10:56.489 --> 10:59.241
{\an1}AHH. JUST ASK ME AGAIN
IN AN HOUR OR 2.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.369
[SMOKE ALARM]

11:02.328 --> 11:03.871
{\an1}TELL ME YOU OPENED
THE FLUE.

11:03.954 --> 11:07.083
THE FLUE. WHAT FLUE?
I DIDN'T SEE A FLUE.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.335
{\an1}SMOKY SCENTED CANDLES
I CAN HANDLE,

11:09.418 --> 11:11.128
{\an1}BUT, MY GOD,
THIS IS A FOREST FIRE.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.631
[COUGHS]

11:14.799 --> 11:16.926
{\an5}[COUGHING]
I CAN'T FIND IT.
COME ON.

11:25.017 --> 11:25.893
GOTTA TELL YOU,
ANDREW,

11:25.976 --> 11:27.937
{\an6}THAT PLACE
IS FALLING APART
WITHOUT YOU.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.189
{\an4}WELL, THE PEOPLE
IN THE CENTER
DEFINITELY NEED ME.

11:30.272 --> 11:33.818
{\an4}WANTING ME,
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IS A DIFFERENT STORY.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.736
{\an3}YEAH, WELL,

STAY CALM, STAY CALM.

32:19.479 --> 32:22.523
{\an4}ALL RIGHT, I'M PANICKING,
I'M OFFICIALLY PANICKING!
I'M PANICKING!

32:22.607 --> 32:23.650
STEVE...

32:25.568 --> 32:27.320
{\an1}I NEED YOU
TO STAY WITH ME.

32:27.403 --> 32:28.529
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

32:28.613 --> 32:29.530
OK, OK.

32:29.614 --> 32:30.907
{\an1}I NEED YOU
TO PACK OUR THINGS

32:30.990 --> 32:32.283
AND PUT THEM
IN A SUITCASE

32:32.367 --> 32:33.242
{\an1}AND TAKE ME
TO THE HOSPITAL.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.244
OK, I CAN DO THAT.

32:35.328 --> 32:38.414
ALL RIGHT,
I CAN DO THAT.

32:38.498 --> 32:39.540
ALL I NEED IS...

32:39.624 --> 32:41.042
PANTS.
PANTS.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.043
PANTS WOULD BE GOOD.

32:42.126 --> 32:43.378
{\an5}ALL RIGHT.
SEE, THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE GONNA BE

32:43.461 --> 32:45.880
{\an6}SUCH A GREAT MOTHER,
BECAUSE YOU REMEMBER
THINGS LIKE PANTS.

32:45.963 --> 32:47.924
{\an5}PANTS
ARE SO IMPORTANT
TO REMEMBER.

32:48.007 --> 32:48.841
STEVE...

32:51.302 --> 32:53.012
{\an1}I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE
A GREAT DAD, TOO.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.222
I'VE NEVER BEEN
THIS HAPPY.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.515
NEITHER HAVE I.

32:55.598 --> 32:58.226
OK, HERE WE GO.

32:58.309 --> 32:59.769
♪ ROLL OUT THE BARREL ♪

32:59.852 --> 33:01.938
♪ WE'LL HAVE
A BARREL OF FUN ♪

33:08.986 --> 33:11.072
{\an6}YOU'VE ONLY
DILATED TO ABOUT
6 CENTIMETERS.

33:11.155 --> 33:12.573
AFTER 12 HOURS?

33:12.657 --> 33:13.741
WELL NOW THAT YOUR
WATER'S BROKE,

33:13.825 --> 33:15.034
THINGS SHOULD MOVE
ALONG MORE QUICKLY.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.578
{\an1}OH, GOOD.
I'M FRESH OUT OF SONGS.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.039
{\an5}I'M NOT EVEN
IN MY EIGHTH MONTH.
WHAT HAPPENED?

33:20.123 --> 33:22.083
PREMATURE BIRTH
CAN BE AGE-RELATED

33:22.166 --> 33:23.710
OR DUE TO HIGH
BLOOD PRESSURE...

33:23.793 --> 33:25.586
{\an5}YEAH, BUT JANET'S
YOUNG, AND HER BLOOD
PRESSURE'S FINE.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.256
OR SOMETIMES THE BABY
JUST WANTS TO SAY HI.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.632
BUT THE BABY'S
GONNA BE OK?

33:29.716 --> 33:30.633
THAT'S WHAT YOU
SAID.

33:30.717 --> 33:31.926
PREEMIES
HAVE ADDED RISK,

33:32.009 --> 33:33.928
BUT YOU'RE
FAR ENOUGH ALONG

33:34.011 --> 33:35.638
THAT YOU PROBABLY
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.098
{\an1}PROBABLY?

33:38.891 --> 33:41.436
{\an6}MY GUESS IS THE BABY
WILL PROBABLY
HAVE TO STAY

33:41.519 --> 33:42.979
IN THE HOSPITAL
FOR A WEEK OR SO

33:43.062 --> 33:45.565
{\an5}TO BUILD UP
HIS STRENGTH.
NOTHING MORE.

33:45.648 --> 33:46.941
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

33:47.024 --> 33:48.943
{\an5}WE'RE MONITORING
THE BABY'S
HEART RATE

33:49.026 --> 33:50.611
AND TIMING
YOUR CONTRACTIONS.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.989
{\an5}THE EPIDURAL SHOULD
WEAR OFF IN TIME
FOR YOU TO PUSH.

33:53.072 --> 33:56.200
{\an6}IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU SHOULD WATCH TV,
PLAY CARDS,

33:56.284 --> 33:59.036
THINK UP NAMES,
AND RELAX.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.455
I'LL CHECK IN LATER.

34:00.538 --> 34:02.373
THANKS, DOC.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.754
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OK.

34:07.837 --> 34:09.172
I KNOW.

34:28.565 --> 34:29.817
BIG GAME TODAY.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.819
YOU'RE COACH'S FRIEND.

34:31.902 --> 34:32.987
YOU MEAN THE GAY GUY?

34:33.946 --> 34:34.989
YEAH, HE'S MY FRIEND.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.616
YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?

34:37.949 --> 34:40.036
YOU SAID IT,
NOT ME.

34:40.119 --> 34:41.871
{\an1}LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

34:41.954 --> 34:43.206
WAS HE A GOOD COACH?

34:43.289 --> 34:44.456
HE WAS OK.

34:44.540 --> 34:45.958
{\an1}WHAT WAS THE BEST THING
HE TAUGHT YOU?

34:47.126 --> 34:48.878
{\an1}I MEAN, BEFORE YOUR MOTHER
HAD YOU ALL WORRIED

34:48.960 --> 34:50.838
{\an1}ABOUT HIM GROPING YOU
IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.172
MAN,
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

34:52.255 --> 34:53.882
WHAT WAS THE BEST THING?

34:55.426 --> 34:56.844
{\an3}HE TAUGHT US
TO TRUST EACH OTHER.

34:56.928 --> 34:57.678
LIKE A TEAM?

34:57.762 --> 34:58.846
YEAH. CAN I HAVE
MY BALL, PLEASE?

34:58.930 --> 35:00.515
STAND UP FOR EACH OTHER.

35:00.598 --> 35:01.724
COME ON, MAN.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.059
{\an1}HEY, DON'T
WALK AWAY FROM ME.

35:03.142 --> 35:04.811
{\an1}THAT'S WHAT HE DID
FOR YOU.

35:04.894 --> 35:06.521
{\an1}HE STOOD UP FOR YOU
AND YOUR PALS.

35:06.604 --> 35:07.855
{\an1}HE SACRIFICED
WHAT HE LOVED TO DO.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.982
HE QUIT HIS JOB FOR YOU.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.360
{\an1}ANYBODY ELSE DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THAT RECENTLY?

35:13.736 --> 35:15.988
YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO.

35:18.574 --> 35:22.203
{\an4}YOU KNOW,
YOU MAY NOT KNOW IT,
BUT THE GAY GUY...

35:22.286 --> 35:24.372
JUST TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO BE A MAN.

35:25.915 --> 35:28.000
{\an1}KID, I KNOW IT'S HARD
TO GO AGAINST YOUR PARENTS,

35:28.084 --> 35:30.044
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THEY ARE WRONG,

35:30.127 --> 35:33.130
{\an1}BUT YOU GOT TO LEARN
TO THINK FOR YOURSELF.

35:44.141 --> 35:46.143
HERE IS THE SOLOMON CASE.

35:46.227 --> 35:48.271
{\an1}DEPOS ARE TOMORROW.
DON'T FORGET.

35:48.354 --> 35:49.605
I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT,

35:49.689 --> 35:52.400
{\an6}BUT I PULLED TOGETHER
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YOU ASKED FOR.

35:52.483 --> 35:53.609
I'M SORRY,
I'M INTERRUPTING.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.403
UH, NO, NO,
YOU ARE NOT.

35:55.486 --> 36:00.283
UM...THIS IS
MY ASSISTANT.

36:00.366 --> 36:02.410
{\an1}OH.
I'M JACKIE TAYLOR.

36:02.493 --> 36:03.744
HI.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.706
UH, I'M GONNA
GO GET SOME COFFEE.

36:06.789 --> 36:07.790
GINA.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.128
{\an1}UH, THIS IS
GINA KINCAID.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.256
I'M SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED,

36:15.339 --> 36:17.717
{\an4}BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
I THINK I DID YOU
A FAVOR.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.219
BY DESTROYING
MY FAMILY?

36:20.303 --> 36:22.597
{\an5}I THINK MELVIN
PROBABLY DID THAT
ALL ON HIS OWN.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.599
{\an4}ALL I DID
WAS TELL YOU
HIS LITTLE SECRET.

36:24.682 --> 36:29.896
{\an6}CALL ME,
AFTER YOU'VE LOOKED
OVER THE STATEMENTS.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.564
UH--

36:33.816 --> 36:34.984
THAT WAS COMFORTABLE.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.444
YOU DON'T SEE IT,
DO YOU?

36:36.527 --> 36:37.862
{\an5}WHAT?

36:36.527 --> 36:37.862
HOW RUDE THAT WAS.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.075
GINA,
I'M LETTING YOU GO.

36:43.159 --> 36:46.621
{\an1}BECAUSE I'M TO BLAME
FOR ALL OF THIS?

36:46.704 --> 36:48.289
NO, NOT ALL OF IT,
BUT ENOUGH.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.832
WELL, KELLY WILL BE HAPPY.

36:49.916 --> 36:53.002
{\an6}THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH KELLY.
THIS THING'S A MESS.

36:53.085 --> 36:55.338
{\an3}BELIEVE ME, NO ONE'S
HAPPY ABOUT IT.

37:02.261 --> 37:03.971
{\an1}HEY, YOU GUYS. HAVE FUN
ON YOUR FIELD TRIP.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.015
BOBBY, NO ROUGHHOUSING.

37:08.100 --> 37:11.145
I'M GONNA MISS IT AROUND HERE.

37:11.228 --> 37:13.731
{\an1}YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO?

37:13.814 --> 37:17.443
{\an1}NOT YET...OTHER THAN
TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU

37:17.526 --> 37:19.195
TO KEEP RUNNING THIS PLACE.

37:19.278 --> 37:22.156
HEY, COACH,
YOU GOT A SECOND?

37:22.239 --> 37:25.159
{\an1}HENRY, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE AT THE GAME?

37:25.242 --> 37:29.789
YEAH, AND I'M GOING,
BUT...SEE, I BEEN THINKING.

37:29.872 --> 37:31.374
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE
A GOOD COACH BEFORE.

37:31.457 --> 37:34.835
THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK
YOU'D BE ANY DIFFERENT NOW.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.672
SO...I'D LIKE YOU
TO STAY.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.007
LOOK, I CAN'T
SPEAK FOR MY MOM,

37:40.091 --> 37:41.342
BUT I TALKED WITH THE GUYS,

37:41.425 --> 37:43.302
AND WE ALL FEEL
THE SAME WAY.

37:43.386 --> 37:45.012
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?

37:45.096 --> 37:49.725
{\an5}SOMEBODY POINTED OUT
SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO
THINK FOR YOURSELF.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.352
AS FAR AS ROLE MODELS GO,

37:51.435 --> 37:54.814
YOU'RE AS GOOD AS
ANY OTHER, I GUESS.

37:54.897 --> 37:58.401
{\an1}BESIDES, WE GOT A GAME
TO PLAY, RIGHT?

37:58.484 --> 37:59.986
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.529
ALL RIGHT.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.618
AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER?

38:07.702 --> 38:10.579
{\an3}OK, SO MAYBE I UNDERSOLD
A LITTLE BIT,

38:10.663 --> 38:13.916
{\an3}BUT, UH,
GOT MY POINT ACROSS.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.294
YEAH, YOU DID. THANKS.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.050
HOW ABOUT MO?

38:23.134 --> 38:24.885
MO SANDERS?

38:24.969 --> 38:25.886
YEAH, SHORT FOR MOSES.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.097
{\an1}THIS WAY, IT GIVES THE KID
SOMETHING TO LIVE UP TO.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.223
UH-HUH. NEXT.

38:29.306 --> 38:31.684
HOW ABOUT, UH...

38:33.644 --> 38:35.354
WOULD YOU GET OFF
THE BED, PLEASE?

38:35.438 --> 38:36.564
YEAH. WHY?

38:37.940 --> 38:39.859
WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:39.942 --> 38:41.736
WE NEED THIS PATIENT PREPPED
FOR AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.946
{\an1}AND MAKE SURE THERE'S
AN O.R. AVAILABLE.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.114
{\an4}AND CALL
THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST.
MOVE IT.

38:45.197 --> 38:46.407
STEVE.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.701
{\an5}WAIT A SECOND.
WHAT'S HAPPENING,
DOCTOR?

38:48.784 --> 38:51.537
{\an1}THE BABY'S HEART RATE IS
A LITTLE SLOWER THAN NORMAL.

38:51.620 --> 38:52.580
{\an1}IF WE LEFT IT IN,
WE COULD BE IN TROUBLE.

38:52.663 --> 38:53.706
WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE?

38:53.789 --> 38:55.666
{\an1}IT'S HARD TO KNOW UNTIL
WE DELIVER, SO WE'LL DO THAT.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.294
{\an1}THEN WE'LL PUT THE BABY IN
THE N.I.C.U. FOR OBSERVATION.

38:58.377 --> 38:59.712
I WANNA BE WITH MY WIFE.

38:59.795 --> 39:03.049
{\an1}STEVE, WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN.
LET US DO OUR JOB.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.029
HEY.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.449
DAVID, PLEASE.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.668
AHEM.

39:42.088 --> 39:43.964
I DON'T WANNA
GET HURT.

39:44.048 --> 39:48.427
{\an4}I JUST CAME OVER TO TELL YOU
THAT...I THINK WE COULD BE
GREAT TOGETHER.

39:48.511 --> 39:51.138
SO FAR,
BEING HURT BY YOU

39:51.222 --> 39:53.641
{\an4}HAS REDEFINED MY LIFE
TWICE IN LESS
THAN 6 MONTHS.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.059
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?

39:55.142 --> 39:57.394
YEAH. I'M JUST REALLY
TRYING TO IGNORE IT.

40:02.525 --> 40:04.151
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.028
AGAIN.

40:07.404 --> 40:11.033
I REALLY HOPE THE
OPERATIVE WORD IS AGAIN.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.175
DID ANYONE EVER SHOW YOU

40:28.259 --> 40:30.845
{\an1}HOW TO USE THE LITTLE THINGY
ON THE TOP OF THE APPLE

40:30.928 --> 40:33.848
{\an1}TO FIGURE OUT THE INITIALS
OF WHO YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY?

40:33.931 --> 40:36.058
{\an1}THE BEST PART IS
YOU CAN TOTALLY CHEAT,

40:36.142 --> 40:38.144
{\an4}DEPENDING ON WHO
YOU WANT IT TO BE.

40:38.227 --> 40:39.937
SWEETIE?

40:43.482 --> 40:46.986
I WANT MOM AND DAD TO LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

40:47.069 --> 40:51.448
{\an1}I KNOW YOU DO. I KNOW.
COME HERE.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.580
I WANT THAT SO MUCH.

41:05.087 --> 41:08.048
[WHISTLES] SO LET ME GUESS.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.634
{\an1}IT'S YOUR TURN ON
THE OLD FAMILY TREE, HUH?

41:10.718 --> 41:12.219
DONNA.

41:12.303 --> 41:13.888
THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.

41:13.971 --> 41:15.431
WHAT'S THAT?

41:15.514 --> 41:21.145
THESE RECORDS INDICATE THAT
MY FATHER HAD 2 CHILDREN.

41:23.314 --> 41:27.276
{\an1}YOUR FATHER, NOT YOUR MOTHER?
WAS HE MARRIED BEFORE?

41:27.359 --> 41:28.402
NO.

41:28.485 --> 41:30.863
ACCORDING TO THIS
BIRTH CERTIFICATE,

41:30.946 --> 41:35.075
HE HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH MY AUNT BOBBI.

41:35.159 --> 41:37.620
[CHUCKLES] WAIT A SECOND.
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT--

41:37.703 --> 41:38.746
YEAH.

41:39.705 --> 41:42.082
IF THIS IS TRUE,

41:42.166 --> 41:44.752
GINA AND I ARE SISTERS.

41:47.046 --> 41:48.339
WOW.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.945
DR. LONG, WHAT'S GOING ON?
NO ONE'S TOLD ME ANYTHING.

42:11.028 --> 42:12.947
JANET'S PLACENTA TORE.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.740
{\an5}SHE AND THE BABY
LOST A SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT OF BLOOD.

42:14.823 --> 42:16.116
YOU NEED TO SIGN THESE.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.827
{\an5}THEY'RE CONSENT FORMS
ALLOWING US TO GIVE JANET
AND YOUR DAUGHTER

42:18.911 --> 42:20.663
{\an5}BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS.

42:18.911 --> 42:20.663
DAUGHTER?

42:35.052 --> 42:36.971
IS SHE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

42:37.054 --> 42:39.348
SHE'S BEING TAKEN
TO THE N.I.C.U.

42:39.431 --> 42:41.392
{\an1}I DIDN'T ASK
WHERE SHE WAS GOING?

42:41.475 --> 42:42.518
{\an1}I ASKED IF SHE'S GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT.

42:42.601 --> 42:43.644
WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN.

42:43.727 --> 42:44.770
HOW'S JANET?

42:44.853 --> 42:46.146
PLEASE, SIGN THESE.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.023
{\an5}I WON'T SIGN ANYTHING UNTIL
YOU TELL ME HOW MY WIFE'S
GONNA BE.

42:48.107 --> 42:49.149
SHE'S LOST
A LOT OF BLOOD.

42:49.233 --> 42:50.818
YOU TOLD ME THAT.

42:50.901 --> 42:53.529
DOES THAT--DOES THAT MEAN
SHE'S GONNA DIE?

42:53.612 --> 42:55.030
STEVE, I KNOW
YOU'RE UPSET,

42:55.114 --> 42:57.616
BUT YOU'VE GOT
TO SIGN THIS.
