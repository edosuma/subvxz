00:01.040 --> 00:05.440
In the world today, protecting
a country's borders is vital.

00:06.760 --> 00:08.920
It is seen as a
gateway to the UK.

00:08.960 --> 00:13.200
These are the men and women in
uniform responsible for safeguarding

00:13.240 --> 00:14.400
Ireland's borders.

00:14.440 --> 00:15.640
Stopping...

00:15.680 --> 00:17.880
Look at me. Behind the
yellow line. ..Searching...

00:17.920 --> 00:19.576
Have you been stopped
at a checkpoint before?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.496
Will you just listen to me?
Will you just listen to me?

00:21.520 --> 00:25.440
..And seizing drugs,
arms and illegal goods.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.856
If anyone tries to harm me,
that dog will tear them to shreds.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.720
Saving lives...

00:29.760 --> 00:31.760
I'd say about 200km per hour.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.720
..And protecting
Ireland's inhabitants

00:33.760 --> 00:36.040
and millions of
visiting tourists.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.480
You could have
been here 100 times,

00:37.520 --> 00:40.600
it doesn't mean that you're
guaranteed to get in the 101st time.

00:42.080 --> 00:42.960
They police the ports...

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Well, you have to make
sure there's definitely nobody

00:46.040 --> 00:46.960
underneath the vehicle.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.440
..The airports...

00:48.480 --> 00:50.120
Why did you tell me
you weren't working?

00:50.160 --> 00:53.200
..And the roads. These are
very badly damaged tyres.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.360
If you can't drive the truck,
shouldn't be on the road.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.120
These are the:

01:07.400 --> 01:09.480
A routine stop and
search... What's the story?

01:09.520 --> 01:13.960
..Turns up an alarming find
for the garda traffic corps.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.880
Some drugs paraphernalia here.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.880
The needles and tubes for
making up their own syringes.

01:19.920 --> 01:23.080
Cork port's four-legged
secret weapon.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.520
That dog will tear
them to shreds.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.840
And at Dublin
airport immigration...

01:27.880 --> 01:29.440
Are you with the group? Yes.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.360
..A student who may be
on the next plane home.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.840
We have a problem, then,
'cause that visa's used.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.240
Cork port is the
second-busiest port in Ireland

01:42.280 --> 01:45.480
and welcomes car ferries,
cruise ships and freight carriers,

01:45.520 --> 01:48.480
giving easy access
to the whole of Ireland.

01:48.520 --> 01:52.240
The front line is
protected by armed police.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.720
Their primary role is to stop
people trying to smuggle themselves

01:55.760 --> 01:57.560
illegally across the border.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.800
Great. Thanks a million. Thanks.

01:59.840 --> 02:00.936
Obviously, families
are coming here

02:00.960 --> 02:01.880
but you still have
to be very careful

02:01.920 --> 02:03.840
about the checks you carry out.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.480
Brilliant, thanks a million.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.920
It's mostly people
that we're interested in.

02:08.960 --> 02:13.320
We walk hand in hand with
customs and they are just contraband.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.080
Thanks very much.

02:17.120 --> 02:21.640
But port security is not just
of the two-legged variety.

02:21.680 --> 02:26.520
Officer harrington is one of two
garda dog handlers for county cork,

02:26.560 --> 02:30.640
assisted by two
dogs, laser and Rex.

02:30.680 --> 02:35.360
Rex is trained to find and detect
various different illegal drugs.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.176
A very common misconception is
that the dogs are addicted to the drugs

02:38.200 --> 02:39.496
they're trained to
find. They're not.

02:39.520 --> 02:43.120
Because a lot of the drugs
that he's trained to detect would,

02:43.160 --> 02:44.976
if he got them into his
system or up his nose,

02:45.000 --> 02:46.216
would actually overwhelm
his system and kill him.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.320
The other dog we have
here today, his name is laser.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.840
Laser's trained primarily
for search and rescue of

02:51.880 --> 02:54.800
missing or vulnerable people but
if the person tries to hurt the dog,

02:54.840 --> 02:57.216
hurt me or escape the dog, he's
trained to bite them and detain.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.736
He's there to defend
me at all costs so,

02:58.760 --> 03:02.040
if anyone tries to harm me,
that dog will tear them to shreds.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.936
When you have a big, angry German
Shepherd that's barking and telling

03:05.960 --> 03:09.680
people to cop on, nine times
out of ten, they tend to listen.

03:09.720 --> 03:15.000
Rex and officer harrington are
ever vigilant as they patrol the port,

03:15.040 --> 03:17.440
working as a team
to detect smugglers

03:17.480 --> 03:20.320
trying to bring contraband
into the country.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.160
Just letting him have a walk by to
see if he can pick up on anything

03:23.200 --> 03:25.520
in passing in any of the cars.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.816
Like, if there's cannabis or
anything like that in the car,

03:27.840 --> 03:29.936
they'd have a very pungent
smell and you'd actually pick it up.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.360
The dogs can pick it
up outside the vehicles.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.360
From time to time, you'll get
specific information that might

03:36.400 --> 03:37.960
suggest that a particular car

03:38.000 --> 03:40.680
might be on the ferry that
might be of interest to us.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.320
A ferry from France is
about to dock at the port.

03:49.920 --> 03:54.160
And the garda are about to act
on a tip-off about a truck on-board.

03:56.240 --> 03:59.000
Ok, guys, we have the ferry
coming from roscoff this morning.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.400
480 vehicles on-board.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.560
There's one truck
that's of interest to us.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.560
We're gonna be checking
that truck, so use your head.

04:10.160 --> 04:14.720
With around 180 vehicles rolling off
the ferry, any one of these could be

04:14.760 --> 04:16.600
carrying illegal immigrants.

04:25.120 --> 04:28.120
The officers spot the target
vehicle as it leaves the ferry

04:28.160 --> 04:31.960
and they pull it over as
it heads to leave the port.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.880
They now move in to
perform a thorough search

04:34.920 --> 04:37.960
before deciding if the truck will
be allowed to enter the country.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.936
Can I just have a quick look in
the back there? You don't mind?

04:39.960 --> 04:43.280
Thanks very much.
No, it's empty.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.320
We checked over at
the far side. Three times.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.800
Three times you were checked?

04:47.840 --> 04:51.280
The garda are prepped and ready
to act, should anyone be hiding

04:51.320 --> 04:54.120
amongst the empty containers.

04:54.160 --> 04:58.960
We've had some problems the
last few months in relation to that.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.640
I suppose it's just the
current climate in Europe.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.376
There are a lot of desperate people
over there trying to get a life and

05:04.400 --> 05:07.520
we're here to make sure
that our borders are secure.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.960
We've had some clandestines
come in on the back of trailers.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.840
Yeah, I'm satisfied this is secure
and there's nobody on-board.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.080
They may have found nothing

05:17.120 --> 05:19.440
but they're not finished yet.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.000
It's time to bring
in the big guns.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.840
Come on, Rex, let's go.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.120
Come on, Rex. Where is it?

05:25.160 --> 05:26.640
Where is it?

05:29.440 --> 05:30.840
Thank you.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.760
Detective garda ray
flannery is on duty

05:32.800 --> 05:35.520
at the immigration
booths in Dublin airport.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.160
How long are you
gonna stay in Ireland?

05:38.600 --> 05:41.880
He's keeping an eye out for
anything that may indicate a passenger

05:41.920 --> 05:45.520
is not being honest about
their intentions in Ireland.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.040
Where are you going to be based?

05:51.960 --> 05:52.880
Alright.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.800
A group of American students have
just landed from Heathrow in the UK.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.840
You're part of the group, yeah?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.760
They're stopping off
in Ireland for a few days

06:02.800 --> 06:04.800
on their way back to the us.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.960
You're with the group?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.040
Do you have a second visa?

06:11.720 --> 06:15.360
But it seems one of the students
has a problem with his visa.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.800
We have a problem, then,
'cause that visa's used.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.080
The tutor arrives at
officer flannery's desk

06:25.120 --> 06:27.600
in order to explain
the situation.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.800
Yeah, the visa he has
is a single-entry visa.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.480
He has to be convinced
that they are telling the truth

06:45.520 --> 06:47.880
or the student will be
back on a plane and on

06:47.920 --> 06:49.720
his way out of the country.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.040
It's deemed used
once it's stamped.

06:55.480 --> 06:59.800
Yeah, so, technically - 'cause
you came to here to go to the UK.

06:59.840 --> 07:04.400
Yeah, so once you landed here,
what then would you go to the UK with?

07:15.040 --> 07:16.216
Yeah, no, it should
have been both...

07:16.240 --> 07:18.336
Officer flannery is happy that
there has been a genuine mistake.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.280
So, how long were you staying?

07:21.840 --> 07:25.360
And allows the boy to enter
Ireland to join his fellow students.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.880
Ok.

07:30.680 --> 07:35.880
He had the correct visas but
just that the Irish visa was stamped

07:35.920 --> 07:39.640
and it didn't need to be stamped
coming through here in transit.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.280
The next passenger at officer
flannery's desk has flown in

07:42.320 --> 07:43.400
from Brazil.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.520
Hi.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.696
He and his family had
previously lived in Ireland

07:51.720 --> 07:53.480
but have been back
in South America.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.840
His family have flown
home ahead of him

07:55.880 --> 07:57.840
and he's just
arrived to join them.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.480
His gnib card has expired.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.600
This gives him immigration
permission to stay in the country

08:09.640 --> 08:14.280
beyond 90 days. He will have
to register again for a new card.

08:14.320 --> 08:15.880
Are you living in Dublin?

08:17.040 --> 08:19.840
You're now in the country,
you go to the local but...

08:19.880 --> 08:21.400
Everything seems to be in order,

08:21.440 --> 08:24.720
until officer flannery asks
the man his address in Ireland.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.440
What address are you living at?

08:31.240 --> 08:32.800
When you left,
you were living in...

08:35.080 --> 08:38.000
The address they have
on record is from 2009.

08:38.040 --> 08:40.280
So when did you
live in indistinct...

08:43.760 --> 08:48.160
Officer flannery isn't concerned
about the man's intentions

08:48.200 --> 08:50.920
but explains that he needs
to keep his contact details

08:50.960 --> 08:53.360
up to date at all times.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.760
Any time you move address,

08:55.800 --> 08:59.000
you have to notify immigration
that you have moved address.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.280
Ok? It's very
important you do so.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.680
And we will hold onto this
card because it's expired.

09:03.720 --> 09:07.320
With officer flannery holding
onto the expired gnib card,

09:07.360 --> 09:10.480
the man will need to
register for a new one.

09:10.520 --> 09:14.280
This time, making sure all his
details are correct and up to date.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.120
Ok.

09:20.520 --> 09:24.040
Back at cork port, the garda
border patrol are on high alert.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.080
Can I just have a quick
look in the back there?

09:26.120 --> 09:28.520
You don't mind?
Thanks very much.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.520
They've had a tip-off that
a truck arriving from France

09:31.560 --> 09:34.800
may be carrying something or
someone it shouldn't have been.

09:34.840 --> 09:38.280
There's nobody on-board. So
far, they've discovered nothing.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.200
Time to bring out their
secret weapon, Rex.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.760
Come on, Rex, let's go.
Come on, Rex. Where is it?

09:44.800 --> 09:47.640
Ho-ho-ho! You're going to work.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.800
Where is it? Where is it? Every
time these dogs go to work, they

09:50.840 --> 09:52.736
think they're playing a game so, if
the dog isn't happy to be searching

09:52.760 --> 09:55.000
for his toy, he won't do it.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.936
So you have to keep the
dogs happy at all times.

09:56.960 --> 10:00.320
The dog goes to work,
checking potential hiding places

10:00.360 --> 10:01.920
for smuggled drugs.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.496
So, now he's in work mode and
he will just fly through this truck

10:04.520 --> 10:08.240
searching it. And if he comes
across anything, he would stop

10:08.280 --> 10:12.640
beside it and start barking
and scratching it, using his paws.

10:12.680 --> 10:17.320
With a sense of smell 2,000 stronger
and 50 times more sensitive than

10:17.360 --> 10:24.040
that of a human's, Rex is a potent
weapon in security operations.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.800
Good boy, Rex.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.560
To him, it's a game,

10:27.600 --> 10:30.400
but if he finds anything,
the drivers won't be smiling.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.200
Come on. Up here, up here.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.536
He's very, very good at what he
does and he can make our search

10:34.560 --> 10:37.000
teams' jobs an awful lot easier.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.880
Good boy. Good boy.

10:41.800 --> 10:45.000
Rex's expert nose finds nothing.

10:47.880 --> 10:51.320
Given the all-clear, the truck is
waved through into the country.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.960
On this occasion, the
tip-off hasn't led to a bust,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.160
but the squad
will remain vigilant,

10:56.200 --> 10:59.760
ready for the next illegal
attempt to enter the country.

11:05.160 --> 11:08.560
The garda traffic corps patrols
the roads around Dublin port

11:08.600 --> 11:10.280
and Dublin airport.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.680
It's their job to keep
these busy entry points

11:12.720 --> 11:15.280
to the republic of Ireland safe.

11:17.080 --> 11:21.480
Officers paddy mcelroy and
Philip Earl are in their patrol car.

11:23.040 --> 11:26.400
And they've spotted
something that rings alarm bells.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.520
They turn the vehicle
around and head off

11:34.560 --> 11:36.080
in pursuit of the Nissan micra.

11:36.120 --> 11:39.280
Just took the turn a
bit quick for my liking.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.360
As the driver overtakes
other road users erratically...

11:42.400 --> 11:43.840
Hasn't copped us yet.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.856
He wouldn't drive like that if
he knew we were behind him.

11:45.880 --> 11:49.320
..The officers radio
in for a vehicle check.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.760
10-12, just looking for a
vehicle registration check.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.960
It's a dark-coloured micra.

12:07.440 --> 12:08.560
Roger that.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.600
It's time to pull
this driver over.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.320
Officer mcelroy approaches
the car to investigate.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.160
Keep an eye on
them, Phil, will you?

12:29.920 --> 12:32.016
You're coming up with loads
of stuff missing on your car.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.880
Yeah. Documentation.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.400
Nct has gone.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.800
Tax has gone.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.440
No insurance displayed.

12:43.480 --> 12:46.440
Can you just turn off your
engine there for a second?

12:49.040 --> 12:50.040
Is it off?

12:50.080 --> 12:53.760
Do you have a driving licence on
you? You have no identification?

12:53.800 --> 12:56.720
Well, who'd you
buy this car off?

12:58.800 --> 13:01.800
Yesterday?

13:01.840 --> 13:04.320
You're tripping yourself up now.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.800
Officer mcelroy suspects the
man is telling him a pack of lies.

13:31.840 --> 13:35.120
He's got no ID and no proof
that the car is legally allowed

13:35.160 --> 13:39.280
on the road, so the officers have
no choice but to seize his vehicle.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.120
Can we get a tow truck
up to this location, please?

13:42.160 --> 13:45.760
Your car's gonna be seized under
section 41 of the road traffic act.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.160
On suspicion of no insurance.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.080
See, you told me you
only bought it yesterday.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.160
How did you get insurance?

13:53.200 --> 13:55.480
Where did you get insurance?

13:55.520 --> 13:57.320
You only said you
bought it yesterday.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.560
I'm not satisfied.
I'm not satisfied.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.680
When I say this,
you have no licence.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.560
Our checks have produced...

14:12.840 --> 14:15.800
It's being seized. I've
made the decision. Ok?

14:15.840 --> 14:19.320
If he's gonna stand any
chance of changing their minds,

14:19.360 --> 14:21.680
he's going to
have to think fast.

14:27.680 --> 14:33.280
With up to 740 flights landing every
day from 180 potential destinations

14:33.320 --> 14:37.480
in 42 countries
over four continents,

14:37.520 --> 14:41.120
the task of keeping Ireland's
borders safe at Dublin airport

14:41.160 --> 14:43.440
is no mean feat.

14:43.480 --> 14:46.080
Hi. How are you? 30 may.

14:46.120 --> 14:49.760
At the immigration desks,
officer O'Connell is on duty,

14:49.800 --> 14:52.640
helping to protect those
borders from potential threats.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.360
How are you doing?

14:54.400 --> 14:56.680
A gentleman has just
flown in from Hong Kong...

14:58.240 --> 15:00.280
..And has arrived at his desk.

15:00.320 --> 15:03.760
Who do you visit?
Your brother and sister.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.880
Do they work here?
They work here.

15:06.920 --> 15:10.880
And do you have their
immigration details?

15:10.920 --> 15:13.720
Do you have a letter?

15:13.760 --> 15:16.360
No. Ok, I'll try and find
them on my system.

15:17.280 --> 15:20.040
Officer O'Connell
can't find any record

15:20.080 --> 15:21.760
of the relatives on the system.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.960
If the man can't prove where
he is staying and who with,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.320
then he could be denied
entry into the country.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.360
They're not on my system.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.000
They're not here. No.

15:35.360 --> 15:36.560
Yeah.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.656
It turns out that
the man is travelling

15:37.680 --> 15:39.480
with another of his sisters.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.760
She joins him at officer
O'Connell's immigration desk

15:42.800 --> 15:45.720
so he can question her about
their reasons for coming to Ireland.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.920
Ok.

15:48.960 --> 15:52.160
No mobile number?
No mobile phone?

15:55.160 --> 15:58.840
07205... this is your sister?

15:59.720 --> 16:01.440
Ok.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.880
The woman gives
him a phone number.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.560
But there's no answer.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.200
Voicemail.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.736
He needs to confirm their story
to ensure that they aren't trying

16:17.760 --> 16:20.040
to enter the country
illegally for work.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.200
For now, they are going nowhere.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.120
Do you know your
sister's date of birth?

16:25.160 --> 16:26.640
Date of birth?

16:26.680 --> 16:28.880
Your sister. Yeah.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.120
Yes, please.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.680
Her date of birth?

16:34.560 --> 16:35.800
And on top of that,

16:35.840 --> 16:38.440
the language barrier is
starting to become a problem.

16:38.480 --> 16:41.080
Date of birth.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.600
Yes.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.440
Is this 1948?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.800
1948, September.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.560
Ok.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.600
And born, or
nationality Hong Kong?

16:56.080 --> 16:58.640
Ok. No records.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.800
He tries to get through again.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.240
Hello, Silvia?

17:10.480 --> 17:12.600
And this time,
the call connects.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.720
Immigration, Dublin airport.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.200
You're expecting a visitor?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.480
Who is it?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.920
Ok, so I just need to
get your gnib number.

17:26.320 --> 17:28.800
Ok, and did you
register at immigration?

17:31.200 --> 17:32.800
You did. Ok.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.640
8 October, 1956.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.080
Ahh, yes, I have you here now.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.640
The woman on the
phone has registered

17:40.680 --> 17:42.840
with the garda national
immigration bureau

17:42.880 --> 17:47.640
and is able to give officer
O'Connell her details.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.920
Yeah, that's fine. He
finds her on the system.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.280
There you go.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.440
Is satisfied that the
couple are genuine

17:53.480 --> 17:56.120
and is happy to give
them leave to land.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.640
So, when you are
visiting next time,

17:58.680 --> 18:03.360
just get a letter from your
sister with all her details on it, ok?

18:03.400 --> 18:06.920
Because then we won't be
delaying the other people. Ok?

18:06.960 --> 18:08.640
Ok. Thank you very much.

18:08.680 --> 18:09.680
Bye. Bye-bye.

18:13.880 --> 18:18.560
If they hadn't any contact
details, it's grounds to refuse,

18:18.600 --> 18:20.136
to be honest with you,
because they're telling you

18:20.160 --> 18:22.800
they're coming to visit
people and if I can't find them

18:22.840 --> 18:26.160
on the system, that means
they're probably not here legally.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.616
So, if I hadn't been
able to find them,

18:27.640 --> 18:29.240
it would have been
grounds for refusal.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.256
Garda traffic corps officers paddy
mcelroy and Philip Earl have pulled

18:33.280 --> 18:35.960
over a car for
driving erratically.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.320
You're coming up with loads
of stuff missing on your car.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.560
They suspect the driver is
being far from honest with them.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.856
I'm not satisfied. Please, god.
Just... I'm not satisfied. Please.

18:44.880 --> 18:49.040
He's got no tax, no insurance
and no national car test certificate

18:49.080 --> 18:53.600
and, on top of all that, he
can't produce a driving licence.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.480
It's being seized. I've
made the decision.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.000
Ok?

19:00.480 --> 19:02.560
They've seized the car

19:02.600 --> 19:06.600
but before the tow truck arrives,
it's time for a routine search.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.096
Ok, we're gonna
give it a quick search.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.240
You have nothing in the
car that you shouldn't have?

19:13.160 --> 19:16.200
Do you take any
drugs at all? Drink?

19:24.160 --> 19:26.280
And the plot thickens.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.640
What's that? Who
is on the cocaine?

19:34.480 --> 19:36.560
Some drugs paraphernalia here.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.720
We have the pipes that they use
for smoking. This seems to be...

19:39.760 --> 19:43.040
It's not something you'd see
much of these days where they

19:43.080 --> 19:46.400
appear to be making up their own
needles by using pins and so on.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.200
No need for that in the
modern day with the government

19:49.240 --> 19:50.840
needle exchange
programs and so on.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.360
It's unusual to see and
it's very old-fashioned.

19:53.400 --> 19:58.920
It's like, you'd see the likes of
the needles and tubes, you know,

19:58.960 --> 20:00.680
for making up
their own syringes.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.720
It's almost like you'd
see in prison rather

20:02.760 --> 20:04.320
than on the streets,
to be honest.

20:05.920 --> 20:10.120
The likes of this, your tin
foil that you use for smoking.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.640
Then we've got
this container here.

20:11.680 --> 20:15.000
The tell-tale sign here is
the green liquid in the bottom.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.600
That's methadone, which
is a substitute for heroin.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.400
People who are
coming off heroine

20:20.440 --> 20:23.440
will be prescribed this through
clinics and doctors and so on.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.080
The bag here is crushed
tablets of some sort.

20:28.120 --> 20:31.200
We're gonna guess, from
the colour and from experience,

20:31.240 --> 20:34.080
they tend to be
sleeping tablets.

20:34.120 --> 20:37.080
Again, more medication.
These are all in the name of

20:37.120 --> 20:40.920
another lady who is not in the
car, who's related to this lady.

20:40.960 --> 20:45.400
She tells us she doesn't take
drugs but a check on our system

20:45.440 --> 20:47.640
tells us the opposite.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.720
They seem to be harmless enough,

20:49.760 --> 20:53.840
two characters living homeless,
basically living out of the car.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.736
Unfortunately, the car
isn't taxed, insured or nct'd,

20:55.760 --> 21:00.280
so there's no way we can
let them drive around like that.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.520
Although they found
drugs paraphernalia,

21:03.560 --> 21:06.760
there's no drugs, so the
officers can only seize their car.

21:06.800 --> 21:11.200
They let them get
their things together and

21:11.240 --> 21:15.240
it looks like they have their entire
lives in a handful of carrier bags.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.480
The car's heading to the pound

21:19.520 --> 21:23.120
and the couple are heading
off under their own steam.

21:23.160 --> 21:26.160
