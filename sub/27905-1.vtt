01:54.543 --> 01:59.682
Final BG slingback at a 47 OTC.

01:59.682 --> 02:04.207
All green moon spacecrafts,
pickup and turnaround.

02:04.530 --> 02:06.740
This will be our final pass
around the green moon.

02:06.971 --> 02:10.871
I repeat: central BG line is
discontinue in service.

02:11.038 --> 02:14.653
Strap up, sit tight
and slingback.

02:23.461 --> 02:31.070
Subtitled by NILNUWAN

02:51.895 --> 02:53.475
Where were you?

02:53.898 --> 02:55.521
I... just stepped out.

02:58.730 --> 03:00.238
I told you not to leave.

03:00.330 --> 03:02.010
Well, I couldn't sleep.

03:04.150 --> 03:06.323
I don't get help...
like you do.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.673
Clean it, please.
Scrub the filters.

03:33.002 --> 03:36.624
In the schedule says that
this is the last run.

03:38.364 --> 03:40.212
The line is shutting down.

03:40.897 --> 03:41.897
M-hm.

03:44.817 --> 03:47.532
You.. didn't tell me that
we could be stranded.

03:48.970 --> 03:50.490
We won't.

03:53.883 --> 03:57.195
We've three cycles for the job
before we've to catch the slingback.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.182
Plenty of time.

04:01.196 --> 04:02.662
Clean the thrower.

05:26.597 --> 05:28.908
You look like your mom.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.952
I need yo to-

05:50.455 --> 05:53.265
Your mother, broke her water...

05:54.506 --> 05:56.197
before you were
supposed to come.

05:56.221 --> 05:57.876
On Lau islands.

05:57.877 --> 06:00.253
We didn't think you
could come so early.

06:01.725 --> 06:03.588
- I didn't know that.
- You were tiny.

06:03.877 --> 06:06.322
I had you in my hand.

06:06.820 --> 06:10.195
You were just red and furious,

06:11.182 --> 06:12.820
fussy and...

06:13.034 --> 06:14.755
covered in hair.

06:15.852 --> 06:17.411
I was born on Lau?

06:20.339 --> 06:21.672
I thought we lived in camaria.

06:21.738 --> 06:24.145
You know, when we
were on holiday.

06:25.156 --> 06:27.989
It was our last holiday
before the baby came.

06:28.765 --> 06:30.391
We should go back.

06:31.271 --> 06:33.290
- You can't swim.
- No.

06:33.314 --> 06:35.629
- You have to swim in Lau.
- Back home. The camaria.

06:35.722 --> 06:38.740
Cavaria. You don't even
know how to say it.

06:40.014 --> 06:42.014
It's not our home.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.583
It's where we lived with mom.

06:45.643 --> 06:47.549
Ah..we're going to...

06:48.523 --> 06:50.269
We're going to
be out of this..

06:50.456 --> 06:53.869
...soon, and get out of

06:54.376 --> 06:57.928
We've got our jobs, it's just,
you know, it's temporary.

07:01.469 --> 07:04.141
I'm sorry.
I haven't tell you.

07:04.482 --> 07:06.215
I should've told you.

07:07.095 --> 07:08.368
Tell me what?

07:22.576 --> 07:23.576
Hey.

08:42.149 --> 08:43.682
Three cycles?

08:44.256 --> 08:45.256
M-hm.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.072
2742, requesting release.

09:19.662 --> 09:21.983
Restart, 2742.

09:22.023 --> 09:25.637
Be advised, BG pivot is
for pickups only.

09:26.546 --> 09:28.239
I know. I know the line is dead.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.263
We'll be back on the other end.

10:36.122 --> 10:37.495
What was that?

10:46.721 --> 10:47.721
Oh, shit!

10:48.921 --> 10:50.548
That's atmosphere.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.800
Come on!

11:15.575 --> 11:17.428
Oh!

11:28.073 --> 11:30.225
Oh! Come on!

11:46.654 --> 11:47.986
God!

11:59.967 --> 12:01.540
What happened?

12:04.086 --> 12:05.793
I don't know.

12:07.953 --> 12:09.954
We were off course.

12:13.493 --> 12:14.493
Here.

12:18.152 --> 12:20.229
Find out where we are.

12:28.045 --> 12:31.400
We needed a cycle... now we
have a half a cycle to harvest.

12:35.132 --> 12:37.039
This piece of shit
put us out of range

12:37.064 --> 12:38.532
We're here.

12:41.426 --> 12:43.275
- Right here?
- Hm.

12:50.571 --> 12:52.500
Let's suit up.

12:53.819 --> 12:55.681
Wwhat about the instruments?

12:55.952 --> 12:58.648
We're just burned out one
of the gels, it's fine.

12:58.673 --> 12:59.926
We still have enough time.

12:59.954 --> 13:01.647
We need to move out now, though.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.285
We'll already be late.

13:44.461 --> 13:45.913
Clear?

13:46.234 --> 13:47.234
Clear.

13:49.313 --> 13:51.289
Alright, you've got the good filter.

13:52.805 --> 13:54.772
But watch your saturation.

14:02.912 --> 14:03.912
Here.

14:05.924 --> 14:07.576
You do it.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.600
I need to keep hands
on the thrower.

15:35.403 --> 15:37.510
It's an old aurelac dig.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.686
Leftovers from the rush.

15:57.276 --> 16:00.751
On my last tour, the forest was
full of these little crank teams.

16:01.822 --> 16:03.596
Not many of them knew
what they were doing,

16:03.689 --> 16:05.407
got pretty scrappy.

16:08.316 --> 16:09.836
Do we have time for this?

16:10.022 --> 16:11.707
This is amateur work.

16:13.301 --> 16:15.295
They might have left
something behind.

16:21.967 --> 16:23.992
Bring me the kit.
And the water.

17:18.894 --> 17:20.705
Hold it.

17:55.901 --> 17:57.526
You want to cut it?

17:59.634 --> 18:00.634
Yeah.

18:01.623 --> 18:04.005
Okay. Alright, right
here in the middle.

18:14.169 --> 18:15.169
Good.

18:17.778 --> 18:20.180
Mix equal parts on the
squeeze for the phaser.

18:50.398 --> 18:53.887
If the blister's punctured,
it releases karum-acid.

18:54.070 --> 18:56.959
If it contacted with the gem,
the whole pull is compromised.

19:03.469 --> 19:04.469
Hey!

19:06.292 --> 19:08.458
If the phaser touches meat,
the whole dig blows.

19:10.068 --> 19:11.773
Be more careful.

19:31.228 --> 19:32.555
See it?

19:37.213 --> 19:39.481
That would have been a solid
pull back in the rush

19:39.877 --> 19:42.555
that our deposite's gonna
pull at least hecatron grade.

19:42.706 --> 19:44.801
But that will wreak-in
at least a few thousand.

19:45.439 --> 19:47.007
Maybe even ten.

19:48.265 --> 19:49.856
Ten thousand?

19:50.318 --> 19:51.318
M-hm.

19:52.664 --> 19:55.504
Ten thousand would be
enough to cover the loan.

19:55.999 --> 19:57.428
Right?

19:58.231 --> 19:59.675
A- And the pod lease.

20:00.226 --> 20:01.699
If we head back now,

20:01.723 --> 20:04.121
there will be enough time to make
sure that we don't miss a slingback.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.024
Uh-uh.

20:09.601 --> 20:10.482
Why?

20:10.507 --> 20:12.450
Ten thousand gets us
back to pugger-

20:12.474 --> 20:14.886
maybe half a stand, then we're
scaning boards for the next one.

20:16.167 --> 20:18.497
- I like the pug.
- You don't like the pug.

20:20.576 --> 20:22.421
There's deposit
that have pinned,

20:22.421 --> 20:24.398
The queen's lair.

20:24.943 --> 20:27.235
It's very special.

20:28.181 --> 20:31.304
Gems that five times this
size, maybe bigger.

20:32.609 --> 20:36.494
With only 15 points on the pull, our net
gains could easily be in the millions.

20:36.672 --> 20:38.623
That's back to central
kind of money.

20:40.381 --> 20:42.217
But..if we miss the slingback-

20:42.242 --> 20:44.000
This is not up for discussion!

20:45.152 --> 20:49.741
We will never ever have
a chance like this again.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.387
I mean, we've been here too long

20:55.411 --> 20:57.411
and we've filled the bladders,
we gotta move out.

21:37.865 --> 21:39.261
Someone's approching.

21:39.345 --> 21:41.241
It looks like two men,
they're armed.

21:41.796 --> 21:43.812
Channel zero, mute your
mic and stay in there.

21:44.137 --> 21:46.338
I'll meet you back on three
when I get the chance.

22:03.007 --> 22:04.600
I only just arrived.

22:04.766 --> 22:07.324
Just passing through when
I spotted this old dig.

22:08.965 --> 22:10.343
I'm curious.

22:12.171 --> 22:14.745
What? You guys need anything
like a filter or some food?

22:14.770 --> 22:17.023
Don't see too many tubes
around these woods anymore.

22:18.603 --> 22:22.263
Yeah, I caught word of the fade,
couldn't resist one last quick job.

22:22.584 --> 22:24.900
I'm not a kid..

22:24.938 --> 22:26.286
Or a retarded man.

22:26.310 --> 22:28.981
I cocked it up in
the peak of the rush.

22:31.745 --> 22:33.778
- Where's he going?
- Is that a serious question?

22:33.803 --> 22:35.267
I told you, I'd just arrived,
I don't have anything.

22:35.295 --> 22:37.608
I believe you, temper man.

22:37.609 --> 22:39.995
But my partner always need
something convincing.

22:40.028 --> 22:42.675
He'll just kill me, if I let you go
without a thorough search.

22:43.775 --> 22:46.515
I never caught
your name, friend.

22:48.362 --> 22:49.362
It's damon.

22:52.010 --> 22:53.459
Nice to meet you, damon.

22:54.609 --> 22:56.022
I'm Ezra.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.391
I can't tell you how
refreshing it is..

23:00.115 --> 23:01.297
...ooh..

23:01.298 --> 23:03.091
To encounter another talker.

23:05.249 --> 23:08.371
Its been quite some time since we've
meet anyone with fluid in motion.

23:11.830 --> 23:13.759
Where're you from, damon?

23:14.944 --> 23:16.437
Nowhere.

23:16.788 --> 23:18.328
How poetic.

23:18.961 --> 23:20.986
I take it you're a..um..

23:21.310 --> 23:23.236
Floater?

23:23.302 --> 23:24.302
Freelancer.

23:24.343 --> 23:25.789
You know, you don't
look like one.

23:26.014 --> 23:27.956
- I need those.
- Yeah, don't yell.

23:27.981 --> 23:29.933
I told you, I don't have anything.
I'd just arrived.

23:29.964 --> 23:31.299
- Alright, damon.
- You don't understand!

23:31.353 --> 23:32.353
Understand what, now?

23:36.005 --> 23:38.471
Damon, it has truly
been a pleasure, but...

23:38.496 --> 23:41.049
pleasantries passed,
it's time to get defensive.

23:42.084 --> 23:43.197
To be completly candid,

23:43.221 --> 23:45.616
this hole has proven to dissapoint
me and my partner both

23:45.616 --> 23:47.369
feel we deserved...

23:48.343 --> 23:50.091
...satisfaction.

23:50.766 --> 23:51.994
You understand?

23:54.579 --> 23:56.292
So, how did you
get here, damon?

23:57.503 --> 23:58.503
Why?

24:02.151 --> 24:03.462
Your ship.

24:03.884 --> 24:05.184
Where is it?

24:05.805 --> 24:09.044
Or perhaps your ship is bit too
risky when you're drop out, I rekon?

24:09.049 --> 24:10.592
Yeah. A pug.

24:10.592 --> 24:12.272
Shit me!

24:12.497 --> 24:14.567
The starters, if you
don't mind.

24:15.014 --> 24:16.014
Where is it?

24:18.215 --> 24:20.030
Don't make me
root for it, damon.

24:20.514 --> 24:24.023
I guarantee you, I'd make it an
unnessecerily painful process.

24:24.051 --> 24:25.839
Get off. Get off!

24:30.510 --> 24:32.177
If I give you the key,
you're just going to kill me.

24:32.202 --> 24:34.686
That is not neccesserily true.

24:35.289 --> 24:39.573
Nevertheless, continuing within the act of
killing is a broadspectrum of technique.

24:40.189 --> 24:43.788
So there is still an incentive for you to act
if that's where you're getting at.

24:52.551 --> 24:54.350
I have a counter-offer.

24:54.586 --> 24:56.209
- Huh! A twist?
- M-hm.

24:58.313 --> 25:00.944
- Go on.
- I'm not here for prospect.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.107
I'm here to harvest.

25:07.758 --> 25:10.359
Then why would be
so cryptic under rails?

25:10.819 --> 25:14.048
You are lucky. I am not
immune to intrigue.

25:14.373 --> 25:16.756
But be careful, you don't
overplay this technique.

25:19.059 --> 25:22.721
I have the precise location of
a massive deposit of aurelac.

25:23.635 --> 25:26.252
But my astimation its the
largest enyone's ever seen.

25:26.455 --> 25:28.449
- I've seen my share.
- The queen's lair.

25:28.953 --> 25:30.304
That's a theory.

25:31.973 --> 25:35.538
I've been hired by a crew of mercs, who
have stumbled upon what they describe

25:35.936 --> 25:38.336
as a deposit, with size
of a hopper turbine.

25:39.029 --> 25:42.827
They're here on some kind of prisoner
escort, found the queen's lair accidently.

25:43.222 --> 25:45.197
Now they're camped on the site.

25:47.822 --> 25:51.936
They needed a digger, so I'm on
contract to harvest it for a cut.

25:54.572 --> 25:55.998
But with the three of us,

25:57.291 --> 25:59.145
and that rail gun..

26:01.679 --> 26:04.218
Couldn't we just take it
off for ourselves?

26:08.202 --> 26:09.949
It's funny.
I don't see any mercs.

26:10.374 --> 26:11.892
Where are they?

26:13.430 --> 26:15.157
I'm not gonna tell you,

26:16.842 --> 26:18.649
but I can lead you there.

26:27.674 --> 26:28.674
Okay.

26:28.927 --> 26:30.582
I'd like to believe you.

26:31.785 --> 26:34.965
Admittedly, more out of
desire than good sense.

26:35.225 --> 26:36.733
But damon...

26:38.384 --> 26:40.441
if there is talk of
the queens lair...

26:41.952 --> 26:43.896
...the excitment is momentary.

26:46.793 --> 26:48.310
Even split.

26:51.324 --> 26:53.013
And there's
a three of us.

26:53.038 --> 26:54.745
We split it in thirds.

26:54.751 --> 26:56.282
That's an even split.

26:58.100 --> 26:59.300
Fine.

27:02.247 --> 27:03.728
This is so exciting.

27:18.653 --> 27:20.053
Are you there?

27:20.934 --> 27:22.100
Yes.

27:22.140 --> 27:25.148
Okay, when we depart, get
the thrower and follow up.

27:25.180 --> 27:27.449
But wait for me to channel
check, when I do..

27:27.474 --> 27:31.342
...they should stop, when they stop
fall in and target the big one.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.980
Remember, only
one shot per cap.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.111
Clear?

27:38.464 --> 27:39.464
Clear?

27:41.924 --> 27:43.414
I need to hear it. Clear?

27:48.998 --> 27:49.998
Clear.

28:56.047 --> 28:58.477
What was it looked like,
back in the day?

28:58.821 --> 29:01.162
- You've always went solo?
- Family crew.

29:02.138 --> 29:03.961
We had a base camp orbiter.

29:04.012 --> 29:05.202
Fancy.

29:05.510 --> 29:08.253
We had a full crawling party
when we arrived here.

29:08.603 --> 29:13.309
Not one of your freighter.
A testing screamer.

29:15.163 --> 29:16.866
Mercs in the green, hah?

29:17.830 --> 29:19.433
last I heard the
word "merc" was..

29:19.458 --> 29:22.852
Way back when freebound raiders
heat up all the corparate expeditions.

29:23.420 --> 29:27.087
They were hired by caero clan for
one of their ceremony over executions.

29:27.580 --> 29:29.389
Caero clan?

29:30.151 --> 29:31.592
You friendly with these fellas?

29:33.732 --> 29:34.732
Nah, I'm..

29:34.806 --> 29:37.004
These questions..
God damn it.

29:44.599 --> 29:45.599
Drop it!

29:46.011 --> 29:47.011
Drop it!

29:47.199 --> 29:48.925
Tell him to drop it!

29:50.179 --> 29:51.179
Drop it!

29:56.223 --> 29:57.523
Get back.

29:57.557 --> 29:58.557
Get back!

29:58.695 --> 30:00.688
You know, this is something
I have never seen

30:02.243 --> 30:04.374
in all my time
on the green.

30:04.974 --> 30:07.107
A little girl.

30:10.849 --> 30:13.835
Damon, I have clearly underestimated
you, I must stop doing that.

30:13.862 --> 30:16.400
Alright. Drop the packs,
both of you.

30:22.963 --> 30:24.679
Alright, sit down, right there.

30:32.755 --> 30:34.237
Damon..

30:35.835 --> 30:37.823
Does this mean
that the plan is off?

30:39.042 --> 30:42.029
You have me all up and bothered
over the queen's lair, Damon.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.084
Huh.

30:59.528 --> 31:00.366
Open it.

31:00.391 --> 31:04.040
Alright, you can have your
fabled spoils all to yourself.

31:04.899 --> 31:07.380
But if your talk of
the queen's lair is true..

31:07.974 --> 31:09.358
...this is just a scratch.

31:09.383 --> 31:10.383
Dad..

31:11.966 --> 31:14.156
- Can we go?
- The girl looks scared.

31:15.270 --> 31:17.091
You should listen to her.

31:17.456 --> 31:18.824
No harm done yet.

31:22.438 --> 31:23.438
Open it.

31:45.923 --> 31:47.381
It's a shame, damon.

31:54.445 --> 31:56.450
We could've been
rich together.

40:10.578 --> 40:12.115
You got a field-kit?

40:15.531 --> 40:16.531
Hey!

40:16.911 --> 40:18.721
Field-kit!

40:46.946 --> 40:48.292
Are you gonna shoot?

40:51.328 --> 40:52.646
You killed my father.

40:52.687 --> 40:53.783
That is...

40:54.510 --> 40:55.838
technically true.

41:00.506 --> 41:01.979
Can't but wait, girl!

41:02.226 --> 41:03.564
Shoot or help!

41:04.774 --> 41:06.248
Just make a move.

41:16.956 --> 41:18.945
Here's what is
going to happen.

41:19.796 --> 41:21.166
You'll lead me to your ship and

41:21.166 --> 41:23.920
and fly me in to connection
orbit for a slingback.

41:24.917 --> 41:27.100
In exchange for this,
I'll not kill you.

41:28.400 --> 41:29.812
This is a good deal.

41:30.360 --> 41:32.952
You killed my father,
so I'm being very geneorus.

41:35.130 --> 41:37.159
I suggest you take it, because
I'll kill you otherwise

41:37.183 --> 41:39.183
and don't think that I won't.

41:41.776 --> 41:43.520
Get me a kit and
we can talk.

42:57.953 --> 43:00.443
Your offer is indeed generous.

43:00.646 --> 43:02.964
You know, I'd be more than
happy to sign and seal,

43:02.964 --> 43:05.049
safe for one glaring slip.

43:07.213 --> 43:09.098
My ship.

43:10.640 --> 43:11.922
You don't have a ship?

43:12.007 --> 43:13.453
Well. I did.

43:15.946 --> 43:17.213
Then there was an event

43:17.238 --> 43:19.852
with my crew concerned in
a bit of aurelac and..

43:21.396 --> 43:23.310
Words and metal flew.

43:24.577 --> 43:26.237
And now, I don't.

43:26.870 --> 43:28.776
We're in the same
trough, you and I.

43:31.979 --> 43:35.125
-

43:37.002 --> 43:38.255
Whow! Whow.

43:38.480 --> 43:39.623
Just. just...

43:39.716 --> 43:41.758
Slow down a bit
there, little bird.

43:43.622 --> 43:45.324
At least wait for
the counter-offer.

43:47.439 --> 43:48.966
I don't think
I should listen to you.

43:48.998 --> 43:50.838
How is it you intend to get home?

43:52.748 --> 43:54.101
That is the goal.

43:54.278 --> 43:55.957
- Am I right?
- That's not

43:57.013 --> 44:00.163
- I'm not telling you.
- The mercs.

44:01.958 --> 44:03.458
They're real,
aren't they?

44:04.739 --> 44:05.739
M-hm.

44:06.536 --> 44:08.238
And the Queen's lair?

44:11.510 --> 44:12.510
M-hm.

44:15.499 --> 44:17.370
You were making
a run for them.

44:18.425 --> 44:21.367
Listen, I know well
the lure of vengence.

44:22.955 --> 44:24.387
I myself...

44:25.439 --> 44:26.774
frequently indulged,

44:26.799 --> 44:28.697
and I have not often
found regret.

44:30.404 --> 44:31.969
But in this moment,
right here...

44:34.107 --> 44:36.315
...I'm afraid for both our sakes,
I must repost.

44:37.273 --> 44:38.943
I say, we go to your mercs.

44:38.968 --> 44:40.663
I play the prospecter.

44:40.971 --> 44:42.924
And together we
ravage the queen.

44:47.366 --> 44:48.608
You're trying to trick me?

44:48.633 --> 44:49.971
And I help you.

44:50.522 --> 44:52.235
I can harvest.

44:52.243 --> 44:53.651
I can offer protection.

44:53.725 --> 44:57.682
A girl of your age, a child,
wanders into a camp of mercs.

44:57.772 --> 45:00.657
At the end of the tour what happnes?
You appeal to their sympathies?

45:01.546 --> 45:02.784
They have none.

45:04.027 --> 45:05.711
They are ruthless propiteers.

45:05.750 --> 45:07.118
You must have
something to offer

45:07.143 --> 45:10.014
or they will find something
to take from you.

45:12.884 --> 45:14.613
Why should I trust you?

45:15.096 --> 45:17.178
You stole from us.

45:18.145 --> 45:20.515
- We did nothing to you.
- That's the fringe, girl.

45:22.979 --> 45:25.832
If you're one to point
fingers at extortion,

45:26.750 --> 45:28.632
well, there's not much I can say.

45:28.750 --> 45:30.379
And then you killed my father.

45:30.404 --> 45:32.837
Now, hold on. I'm keen to make
the case that damon killed himself.

45:32.862 --> 45:34.298
We were trying to escape.

45:34.398 --> 45:37.492
He was trying to steal my thropy
cases, what he was trying to do.

45:38.241 --> 45:40.351
A man's work is no petty thing.

45:42.182 --> 45:43.919
To you, his daughter..

45:44.522 --> 45:47.762
...I truly apologize for my
contribution to his passing.

45:50.302 --> 45:52.093
But he was stealing
my entire harvest.

45:54.501 --> 45:57.516
And actions like these foment the
threat of appropriate reactions.

45:57.841 --> 45:59.117
Your Father knew that,

46:01.369 --> 46:03.830
and if didn't, then he had
no business in the green.

46:08.225 --> 46:09.754
You're a killer.

46:11.954 --> 46:13.305
I am, indeed.

46:15.903 --> 46:16.903
But, are you?

46:20.514 --> 46:22.680
It was all in the name of
self-preservation, birdie,

46:22.704 --> 46:24.019
it was nothing personel.

46:24.020 --> 46:25.097
Shut up.

46:25.170 --> 46:26.694
- I'm your safe
- Shut up!

46:26.718 --> 46:28.248
And in the end
we'll both be rich.

46:43.754 --> 46:45.173
Even split.

46:46.431 --> 46:47.787
Of course.

46:48.968 --> 46:50.372
There is one more thing.

46:50.740 --> 46:53.669
My filter's spent.
I'm gonna need a hook-up.

47:09.345 --> 47:10.710
What is your name?

47:20.406 --> 47:21.868
Do you mind
if I take a look?

47:23.195 --> 47:24.781
I can handle a map.

47:29.149 --> 47:31.114
You know about these mercs.

47:32.133 --> 47:33.844
When did they arrived?

47:33.927 --> 47:35.558
- How many are there?
- I don't know.

47:35.878 --> 47:37.367
He didn't tell you anything?

47:43.459 --> 47:46.121
It's bad practice keeping you
in the dark, if you ask me.

47:46.164 --> 47:48.737
What? It just doesn't suit you?

47:49.128 --> 47:52.576
A deep partnership is only
made so by candid discourse.

47:52.732 --> 47:54.228
Like with your mute friend.

47:56.424 --> 47:58.350
Well, number two was
more of a utility..

47:59.179 --> 48:00.446
Than a partner.

48:00.470 --> 48:02.470
And it seems like your father
treated you the same way.

48:02.508 --> 48:04.347
Stop talking about my father.

48:15.679 --> 48:16.879
What's your name?

48:22.103 --> 48:23.884
Well, I have to call
you something.

48:44.814 --> 48:46.220
Oi, number 3.

48:52.900 --> 48:55.396
Alright, watch the tube, girl.

49:03.032 --> 49:04.032
Thank you.

49:20.455 --> 49:22.420
If you don't know the thing
about tunnel rats,

49:22.483 --> 49:23.944
it's when they fornicate,

49:24.006 --> 49:26.932
they excrete a hormone substance,
I don't know what its called,

49:27.199 --> 49:29.396
but it's uncannily sticky,

49:30.437 --> 49:32.061
it cocks up electrics..

49:32.834 --> 49:34.274
And it smells exactly alike

49:34.299 --> 49:37.573
but significantly more potent
than stale human urine.

49:37.748 --> 49:39.339
Could you stop?

49:39.518 --> 49:42.319
Anyways, we stripped..

49:42.344 --> 49:43.979
...every panel in that ship.

49:45.146 --> 49:47.939
We clubbed those
rat beavers to death.

49:48.881 --> 49:51.421
It was a toilsome
marathon of carnage.

49:52.702 --> 49:54.192
-

50:02.807 --> 50:05.714
You know, eventually, you're
gonna have to trust me.

50:06.412 --> 50:09.020
Let's go.

50:40.837 --> 50:42.776
- What's wrong with you?
- Just give me a moment.

50:59.872 --> 51:01.393
You should...

51:01.517 --> 51:04.246
keep the thrower low,
we could be surrounded.

51:04.270 --> 51:06.630
- What?
- I said, keep it low.

51:07.853 --> 51:11.061
- He's coming closer.
- Don't show any sign of aggression.

51:15.170 --> 51:17.082
Drop it.

51:17.151 --> 51:18.980
- Put your hands above your head.
- What?

51:19.160 --> 51:20.627
- Just do it.
- Why?

51:20.652 --> 51:22.748
Just do it! Now!

51:52.059 --> 51:54.476
- We have to follow him.
- Why?

51:54.501 --> 51:56.802
The wound appear..

51:57.790 --> 52:00.055
Ideal bite.

52:00.164 --> 52:02.207
It still has some venom.

52:03.249 --> 52:04.760
The dust.

52:05.180 --> 52:07.669
It found its way in,
and now it festers.

52:08.143 --> 52:10.707
They're religous settlers

52:10.932 --> 52:13.257
and tidious scavengers.

52:13.282 --> 52:16.553
They should be -
trade for medical supplies.

52:16.883 --> 52:19.995
- We don't have time.
- We don't have a choice.

52:20.381 --> 52:22.265
You don't.

52:24.891 --> 52:27.057
You shoot me, then.

53:21.306 --> 53:23.133
Who are you?

53:23.958 --> 53:26.199
I have sustained a wound,

53:26.370 --> 53:29.987
that's due to inadequate
treatment, now festers pink.

53:32.218 --> 53:34.553
I was hoping you
had some juice.

53:39.832 --> 53:41.830
We've got juice.

53:42.254 --> 53:45.609
Thank you, sir. We're
tremendously greateful.

53:45.634 --> 53:48.074
No! No throwers.

53:48.210 --> 53:50.593
I thought perhaps it might
interest you for trade.

53:50.618 --> 53:52.674
No..

53:52.690 --> 53:54.234
Throwers!

53:54.256 --> 53:55.987
A wise and understandable measure.

53:56.312 --> 54:00.407
We'll just store them at our discretion
and return shortly, unarmed.

54:01.739 --> 54:03.920
Is that acceptable to you
and your collegues?

54:05.580 --> 54:06.788
Alright.

54:06.913 --> 54:07.961
Here.

54:37.038 --> 54:39.148
I was once a man like you,

54:39.250 --> 54:41.608
who came with the mind
to strike aurelac.

54:43.798 --> 54:46.256
But that man died down
there in the green.

54:48.765 --> 54:51.182
Born anew amongs friends,

54:51.473 --> 54:54.946
bonded in to lairs
beyond the ability

54:55.275 --> 54:57.190
and started to percieve it.

55:02.439 --> 55:04.455
And now, our son
will play for you.

56:02.525 --> 56:04.081
That was beautiful.

56:27.546 --> 56:29.110
Juice.

56:30.407 --> 56:32.636
It's good for you,
it cleanses the dust.

56:40.874 --> 56:42.728
Thank you for
your kindness.

56:43.892 --> 56:47.192
Now, as you can see, I have sustained
a trauma to my shoulder.

56:48.974 --> 56:51.413
It would much like to flush
it with your magic juice.

56:52.433 --> 56:54.435
And to keep straight...

56:54.760 --> 56:57.418
we would also be very much
interested in proper dressing

56:59.185 --> 57:00.518
and filter refreshers,

57:00.542 --> 57:02.542
if you have them
and can spare them.

57:05.477 --> 57:08.251
In return for your
greacious offering..

57:09.143 --> 57:11.393
We're prepeared to compensate..

57:11.441 --> 57:13.646
...with generosity
in equal mesure.

57:26.500 --> 57:28.494
Here's our offer.

57:48.586 --> 57:50.456
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

57:52.467 --> 57:53.867
For the girl.

58:05.233 --> 58:07.271
That is a bold offer.

58:08.246 --> 58:10.116
It has been determined,

58:10.179 --> 58:12.627
you can't see it 'cause
aurelac fills your eyes.

58:13.822 --> 58:16.053
But it is inevitble
all the same

58:16.466 --> 58:19.677
that she will be reborn,
just like me.

58:21.429 --> 58:23.465
That is the reason why
you were brought here..

58:24.236 --> 58:26.136
...not aurelac.

58:29.012 --> 58:30.843
What do you need her for?

58:33.433 --> 58:35.173
We've lost our mother.

58:37.027 --> 58:40.139
It's time to rebuild.

58:41.219 --> 58:44.787
The commencer have felt our
loss and pulled you here,

58:45.751 --> 58:48.067
to reclaim the balance.

01:01:35.003 --> 01:01:36.488
Hello!

01:01:41.355 --> 01:01:43.389
Hello to the green!

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.932
Not so funny.

01:01:55.815 --> 01:01:59.151
It suggested mankind
make a bad deal.

01:02:00.955 --> 01:02:02.700
If anyone's out there,

01:02:03.538 --> 01:02:05.660
don't hesitate to click on.

01:02:53.146 --> 01:02:55.422
Take your helmet off.

01:03:05.903 --> 01:03:07.893
You look like shit.

01:03:15.674 --> 01:03:18.223
Eat it. There is
cases of 'em in here.

01:03:36.267 --> 01:03:37.267
Here.

01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:57.150
I need your help.

01:03:58.390 --> 01:04:01.721
After you left, those guys weren't
too keen on helping me out..

01:04:01.746 --> 01:04:03.774
So I had to treat myself.

01:04:04.431 --> 01:04:06.792
I botched the excision.

01:04:07.755 --> 01:04:11.038
I was unable to clean and
scrape the blackness.

01:04:13.207 --> 01:04:16.510
Now if I don't lose
my arm, it'll kill me.

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:20.450
And I can't perform the
procedeure by myself.

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.268
Were you going to
give me to them?

01:04:34.869 --> 01:04:36.169
No.

01:05:04.592 --> 01:05:06.731
You ever use one
of these before?

01:05:07.046 --> 01:05:08.491
It's easy.

01:05:08.559 --> 01:05:09.890
Prime it like this,

01:05:10.176 --> 01:05:12.552
...then there're
five levels of intensity.

01:05:13.763 --> 01:05:16.247
2 for flesh,
4 for bone.

01:05:19.159 --> 01:05:20.459
You got it?

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:28.480
Thank you.

01:05:36.076 --> 01:05:37.863
Will it hurt?

01:05:40.592 --> 01:05:42.607
I won't feel a thing.
Hack away.

01:05:44.894 --> 01:05:46.211
Quick..

01:05:46.245 --> 01:05:48.011
Confident strokes
our best.

01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:50.621
Try to go full circuit
on the first cut.

01:05:52.938 --> 01:05:54.780
I've never had to
use these before.

01:05:57.167 --> 01:05:58.610
Kind of nice...

01:05:59.109 --> 01:06:00.675
tingling,

01:06:00.716 --> 01:06:02.508
almost like

01:06:02.533 --> 01:06:03.533
Oh, shit.

01:06:03.769 --> 01:06:04.769
Oh, shit.

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:06.461
Oh, shit!

01:06:06.625 --> 01:06:08.537
- What?
- Oh, shit.

01:06:09.323 --> 01:06:10.907
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

01:06:10.957 --> 01:06:12.873
- Does this hurt?
- No. I don't know.

01:06:12.898 --> 01:06:15.124
Keep going,
you're doing great.

01:06:15.149 --> 01:06:16.826
Keep going untill
you hit bone.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.503
I'm gonna miss'em.

01:06:36.934 --> 01:06:39.906
My primary weapon, been
with me my whole life.

01:06:43.555 --> 01:06:46.030
Alwaye there,
ready to help.

01:06:46.097 --> 01:06:48.168
No job too greedy.

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:51.438
No love..too intimidate.

01:06:52.084 --> 01:06:54.417
- Oh!
- Sorry.

01:06:54.442 --> 01:06:56.722
Up to 4.
let's finish it off.

01:06:56.747 --> 01:06:59.322
Give my stump a hardy coat
of juice and cream it all shut.

01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:01.890
Clear?

01:07:03.015 --> 01:07:04.015
Clear.

01:08:08.873 --> 01:08:11.032
How are you so calm?

01:08:12.663 --> 01:08:15.122
You've done this before.

01:08:19.807 --> 01:08:21.670
I was twelve..

01:08:22.179 --> 01:08:24.962
...we spend a season
prossessing meat.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.978
Once they choped
all the big meat cuts..

01:08:29.002 --> 01:08:32.147
...they had me climbed inside the
body cavity to clip the organs..

01:08:32.531 --> 01:08:35.854
So I could get the eggs out
without mangling them.

01:08:37.688 --> 01:08:40.636
It took an hour to wash the
blood out of my hair every night.

01:08:42.965 --> 01:08:44.903
This is pretty straight,
compared to that.

01:08:48.071 --> 01:08:49.071
Done.

01:09:18.138 --> 01:09:20.136
So, where is your home?

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:22.211
I don't have one.

01:09:22.381 --> 01:09:24.988
You spoken like a true floater.

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.167
What's that book
you carry around?

01:09:39.194 --> 01:09:41.792
- It's "the Streamer Girl"
- "Streamer girl"?

01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:43.144
It's a novel.

01:09:43.169 --> 01:09:45.055
- You wrote a novel?
- No.

01:09:45.755 --> 01:09:47.520
No, I'm just writing it out.

01:09:47.814 --> 01:09:49.956
You really don't know
the streamer girl?

01:09:50.051 --> 01:09:53.225
There's not a lot of literature
in circulation out here.

01:09:53.549 --> 01:09:55.974
Oh.
That's so good.

01:09:57.072 --> 01:09:59.232
Ilt's about this
group of friends.

01:09:59.283 --> 01:10:02.738
They grew up together at the bausin
conservatory in the ephraty.

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:06.977
It follows their life to school,
graduation and after.

01:10:08.286 --> 01:10:10.847
Chloe and Rave are
my favorites. They end up-

01:10:13.393 --> 01:10:15.059
I shouldn't tell you, in case
you read it someday.

01:10:15.117 --> 01:10:16.676
Well, it seems I must.

01:10:16.904 --> 01:10:18.409
It's my favorite.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:22.273
I lost my copy and
I'm working on a new one.

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:24.465
Um..I'm not done yet.

01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:27.168
- You memorized it?
- Not the exact words..

01:10:27.772 --> 01:10:29.308
But I know every scene.

01:10:31.557 --> 01:10:33.395
Sometimes..

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.222
...I imagine that I would've been
in the Ephrati with them.

01:10:37.885 --> 01:10:41.017
I like to think about what happens in
between what's already been written.

01:10:41.317 --> 01:10:43.187
So I add new scenes sometimes,

01:10:43.816 --> 01:10:46.173
because then I get to spend
more time in their world

01:10:46.734 --> 01:10:47.734
and

01:10:48.718 --> 01:10:50.766
It's like they were
more real to me, like,

01:10:51.218 --> 01:10:53.179
...like I can have
conversations with them.

01:10:59.778 --> 01:11:02.029
- You must think I'm strange.
- Not at all.

01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:05.617
It's quite impressive.

01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:07.404
When I lost the book,

01:11:08.451 --> 01:11:10.538
he said that it was
for the best.

01:11:11.688 --> 01:11:13.405
He said that it was
just a distraction,

01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:15.990
that I was wasting my time
reading the same book,

01:11:16.947 --> 01:11:18.804
and that I needed a focus.

01:11:18.829 --> 01:11:20.160
- Focus on what?
- Hm..

01:11:20.653 --> 01:11:23.340
Cultivating skills
related to my field.

01:11:26.839 --> 01:11:28.331
Maybe he was right.

01:11:29.724 --> 01:11:33.265
Maybe if I had then
he wouldn't be dead.

01:11:41.251 --> 01:11:42.948
Oh boy, you can't...

01:11:45.646 --> 01:11:47.541
you can't think like that.

01:11:51.887 --> 01:11:53.400
It's not good.

01:11:56.826 --> 01:11:58.875
If you need someone
to blame, you blame me.

01:12:00.617 --> 01:12:02.326
You need to think
about your next move.

01:12:11.222 --> 01:12:12.749
My name is Cee.

01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:20.402
It's nice to meet you, Cee.

01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:48.563
M-hm.

01:12:48.854 --> 01:12:50.643
There's our ride.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.609
Stay clear and close
when I talk us through.

01:13:01.157 --> 01:13:04.328
When it comes time to dig,
I need you to be sharp.

01:13:05.307 --> 01:13:07.697
I've never harvested
one handed before.

01:13:07.897 --> 01:13:09.463
I'm gonna need some help.

01:13:09.497 --> 01:13:11.480
But we'll keep it cleanly

01:13:11.796 --> 01:13:13.958
and it will all be fine.

01:14:33.894 --> 01:14:35.817
Damon, here for the dig.

01:14:42.493 --> 01:14:44.935
-

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.942
I whole heartedly
apologize for being late.

01:14:48.002 --> 01:14:50.746
But as the storm tidies us
half the mark,

01:14:51.118 --> 01:14:53.307
we were already-

01:15:33.906 --> 01:15:35.467
You're late.

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:40.030
I whole heartedly apologize.
You wouldn't believe..

01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:47.970
You ready to dig?

01:15:49.394 --> 01:15:50.910
Well, actually...

01:15:52.269 --> 01:15:55.249
before we get started,
I'm afraid I must interject.

01:15:55.274 --> 01:15:57.404
I haven't been completly
candid with you yet.

01:15:58.019 --> 01:16:00.847
After an erring landing
and toilsome trick,

01:16:00.868 --> 01:16:03.295
there is one more significant
detail to our story,

01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:05.499
one that forces us to
leverage out talents

01:16:05.523 --> 01:16:07.647
for little bit more than
the agreed upon price.

01:16:07.872 --> 01:16:09.437
15 points.

01:16:09.462 --> 01:16:11.108
It's not more of
a cut we're after.

01:16:11.177 --> 01:16:13.852
Points are more than adquate
payment for the two of us,

01:16:16.381 --> 01:16:18.422
alright?
It's means of transit we lack.

01:16:18.670 --> 01:16:20.518
We need a ride-up
to the freighter.

01:16:20.547 --> 01:16:22.219
Can't help you.

01:16:23.391 --> 01:16:25.007
Then we're not going to dig.

01:16:25.132 --> 01:16:26.541
Well, yeah,

01:16:27.258 --> 01:16:28.799
what see means to say is

01:16:28.825 --> 01:16:32.380
that while transport is
a requsite part of the deal,

01:16:32.405 --> 01:16:35.145
we're willing to
forgo two points.

01:16:36.705 --> 01:16:39.662
Which by any rekoning is
exorbitant compensation

01:16:39.687 --> 01:16:41.062
for a hop to the orbit.

01:16:41.162 --> 01:16:43.101
I said, we can't do it.

01:16:43.155 --> 01:16:45.065
Take off already peaked

01:16:45.065 --> 01:16:47.402
and we ain't putting
your weight in payload.

01:16:47.479 --> 01:16:49.652
Oh, come now. In a prize..

01:16:49.689 --> 01:16:51.647
Quite well over the weight
of the passenger and a half.

01:16:51.672 --> 01:16:54.156
Cargo braces. That's one hundred,
one thirty right there.

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.256
Braces already been guarded.

01:16:56.889 --> 01:16:58.256
What about the water reservoir?

01:16:58.281 --> 01:17:00.630
She a rod chomper,
Bad bones.

01:17:01.336 --> 01:17:04.197
- Engine skirt?

01:17:04.248 --> 01:17:05.735
A..a.. boss converter.

01:17:05.829 --> 01:17:07.649
How are we going to
live with no converter?

01:17:10.183 --> 01:17:12.677
My farther once
the spare battery and

01:17:12.702 --> 01:17:15.702
punch the orbit squares in
the handpads of the pod-

01:17:28.399 --> 01:17:30.815
And now you're
looking to talks what?

01:17:31.615 --> 01:17:35.555
The job hasn't changed, so keep
your fifteen and get the digging

01:17:35.725 --> 01:17:38.254
before we miss the
last train home.

01:17:39.370 --> 01:17:41.839
Your way off is
not our problem.

01:17:46.081 --> 01:17:48.157
You're not understanding me.

01:17:49.379 --> 01:17:50.985
Everything is changed.

01:17:51.052 --> 01:17:53.639
If you're not willing to scrap
payload, scrap crew for all I care,

01:17:53.737 --> 01:17:56.140
but you'll find a way,

01:17:57.190 --> 01:17:59.448
if you want that
buried tresure.

01:18:05.041 --> 01:18:08.789
Anyone here's been
looking for a way out.

01:18:09.133 --> 01:18:12.896
I rekon you'd best jump to it,
if you trying to keep your pay

01:18:13.371 --> 01:18:15.263
and your girl.

01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:29.018
I am the gatekeeper to more wealth
than any of you've ever seen

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:33.790
and you've been wasting in
the green for far too long

01:18:33.814 --> 01:18:35.814
to let that slip away.

01:18:36.556 --> 01:18:38.853
I'm afraid, I'm the only means

01:18:39.722 --> 01:18:41.939
to the successful
end of your venture.

01:18:42.893 --> 01:18:45.151
And I say the terms
have changed.

01:18:45.894 --> 01:18:49.892
13, plus a ride for me and my
partner on your handsome craft

01:18:51.816 --> 01:18:53.618
or no deal.

01:18:54.259 --> 01:18:56.606
Find a way.

01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:01.758
You know, I do not intend
to breach my station but,

01:19:02.769 --> 01:19:04.760
perhaps the secondary hydrogen tank

01:19:04.784 --> 01:19:06.784
offers a survivable solution
to this stalemate.

01:19:06.954 --> 01:19:08.876
One that will keep
us all in pay.

01:19:09.007 --> 01:19:10.232
My boy, this is a win.

01:19:10.257 --> 01:19:13.651
I think a little back up thrust is an
easy drop under the circumstanses.

01:19:13.774 --> 01:19:15.776
What do you say, boss?

01:19:19.383 --> 01:19:20.583
Fine.

01:19:54.779 --> 01:19:56.408
This way.

01:20:02.617 --> 01:20:04.152
Gentlemen..

01:20:04.252 --> 01:20:05.847
And women...

01:20:06.845 --> 01:20:08.573
let's get rich.

01:20:14.974 --> 01:20:17.120
Strange method for an execution.

01:20:17.328 --> 01:20:19.735
What did this fella do
to landing in the box?

01:20:20.121 --> 01:20:23.930
Don't know. he came to us
packaged up in powder pink.

01:20:24.377 --> 01:20:27.839
Had to slog all the way out here
just to leave him here to die.

01:20:28.344 --> 01:20:30.427
Apparently, It's a tradition.

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:33.610
- How convoluted!
- Don't need to tell me.

01:20:33.685 --> 01:20:36.044
But the pay is good,
so I don't miss-care.

01:20:37.533 --> 01:20:39.213
There she is.

01:20:53.146 --> 01:20:54.867
Somebody ought to
give her go.

01:20:55.008 --> 01:20:57.274
When we found it

01:20:57.557 --> 01:21:00.832
Our boy over there did it first.
It ate his arm,

01:21:01.227 --> 01:21:02.737
so we called you in.

01:21:02.762 --> 01:21:04.699
That's the prize for
a dry breach.

01:21:06.285 --> 01:21:08.446
But my chemo will calm it.

01:21:16.337 --> 01:21:18.117
Chemo, sweetheart.

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.676
It's a big one.

01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:16.835
You've got it?
Nice and tight.

01:22:25.297 --> 01:22:27.335
Hold it like you love it.

01:22:44.210 --> 01:22:45.670
That's perfect.

01:22:59.751 --> 01:23:01.899
Slippery son of a bitch.

01:23:07.569 --> 01:23:10.164
No, no, no. Shit!

01:23:22.295 --> 01:23:24.527
Not to worry,
we go again.

01:23:51.183 --> 01:23:54.806
-

01:23:54.905 --> 01:23:57.256
-
- You know how to do this?

01:23:57.286 --> 01:23:59.341
It's a little difficult
to do it weak handed.

01:23:59.373 --> 01:24:00.644
What did you say?

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:03.969
It sounded like you
said you can't do this.

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:07.898
- Now, hold on.
- Wait, wait.

01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:57.669
Alright, you can't dig for shit.

01:24:58.337 --> 01:24:59.864
Finish them.

01:25:22.721 --> 01:25:24.956
Those shots will bring
the rest of the men.

01:25:25.046 --> 01:25:26.644
What do we do?

01:25:26.832 --> 01:25:28.802
I don't know.

01:25:39.079 --> 01:25:40.079
Shit!

01:25:44.523 --> 01:25:46.123
Greedy fool!

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:49.054
He knocked himself.

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:52.675
Took a stumble,
getting a closer look.

01:25:52.744 --> 01:25:54.537
Now, time's precious

01:25:55.827 --> 01:25:58.654
and I am gonna need
assistance if we're-

01:26:32.735 --> 01:26:34.413
Go, go! Go!

01:26:48.818 --> 01:26:50.427
Over here!
Over here!

01:26:59.538 --> 01:27:00.538
Move!

01:27:23.716 --> 01:27:25.216
I'm out.

01:27:32.219 --> 01:27:33.792
If we uncouple and

01:27:34.535 --> 01:27:37.417
you can run a distraction, I'll
open him up with a backstab.

01:27:38.652 --> 01:27:40.490
Are you sure?

01:27:51.764 --> 01:27:53.365
I can do it.

01:27:59.756 --> 01:28:02.147
You run fast,
and you don't stop.

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.414
You keep playing the trees
between you and her,

01:28:04.439 --> 01:28:06.992
you come straight back here
as soon as I make the kill,

01:28:07.718 --> 01:28:09.906
so we can recouple.
Are we clear?

01:28:09.935 --> 01:28:10.935
Clear.

01:29:48.472 --> 01:29:50.193
You need to go.

01:29:51.310 --> 01:29:53.049
You grab the gun
and you go.

01:29:54.032 --> 01:29:55.534
You can make it.

01:29:59.907 --> 01:30:01.309
Get outta here!
