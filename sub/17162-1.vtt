00:18.119 --> 00:22.356
[male narrator]
There are a great many stories
out there in the world.

00:22.390 --> 00:29.330
Some are good, some are great,
and a precious few,
are truly special.

00:29.363 --> 00:33.267
This is a story
of heroes and villains,

00:33.301 --> 00:37.805
of trapped princesses,
evil giants, and unicorns.

00:37.838 --> 00:41.875
And the brave souls who rise to
defend and rescue the innocent.

00:41.909 --> 00:46.814
This is one of those
exact stories...

00:46.847 --> 00:50.751
minus the unicorns,
unless you're really baked,

00:50.784 --> 00:52.986
then there will be unicorns.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.489
Ta-dah.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.892
- Your mom will be here soon,
Jack.
- Thanks, Pix.

00:58.926 --> 01:02.763
It's all right, won't be the
first time she's missed it.

01:02.796 --> 01:08.469
Light it. You gonna make a wish?

01:11.205 --> 01:15.209
[narrator] Every year, Jack
makes the same hopeful wish,

01:15.243 --> 01:19.913
to one day,
finally meet his father.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.116
Happy birthday, Jackie.

01:25.319 --> 01:28.522
Your queen has arrived.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.859
What... who's died?

01:31.892 --> 01:33.594
It's your son's birthday.

01:33.627 --> 01:34.795
[gasps]

01:34.828 --> 01:36.597
No, no, no, I haven't forgotten,

01:36.630 --> 01:38.199
I, um...

01:45.038 --> 01:48.809
Happy Birthday, Jackie.
There you go.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.978
Now, let's have a drink.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.519
[sighs]

01:58.552 --> 02:00.087
[liquid pouring]

02:01.989 --> 02:06.494
- I'm 21 now, Mom. It's time.
- For what?

02:06.527 --> 02:08.929
Oh, come on, Roxy,
he wants to know who his dad is.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.399
I don't know, all right?

02:11.432 --> 02:15.936
It was the 90's,
it could have been anyone
with or without a fucking pulse.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.107
Mom, I deserve to know.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.975
You said you would tell me
when I was 21.

02:22.009 --> 02:25.946
Why do you care anyway?
He doesn't give a shit about us.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.848
You do know who he is!

02:27.881 --> 02:31.652
Jackie, will you stop
trying to climb back up
my fanny, all right?

02:31.685 --> 02:35.723
- Grow up you're 19.
- I'm 21.

02:35.756 --> 02:41.962
Right. Come on,
fucking Slut Puppets,
let's fuck this shit up.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.665
Let's get the party started...
How do you get through this
door...

02:46.200 --> 02:47.535
Wait, where is it?

02:47.568 --> 02:48.969
Come on!

03:01.349 --> 03:04.552
- [Pix]
That's his lighter, you know.
- What?

03:05.686 --> 03:08.121
[chuckles]
Mom gave me this
when I was five,

03:08.155 --> 03:10.324
she was teaching me
how to light her bong.

03:10.358 --> 03:13.193
Yeah, and... he gave it to her.

03:15.028 --> 03:19.633
- You know who my father is?
- Yeah, but Jack, you know, I...

03:19.667 --> 03:23.937
Pix, please tell me I mean, I'm
not gonna talk to her about it.

03:23.971 --> 03:27.174
Well, what are you gonna do
if I do tell you?

03:27.207 --> 03:29.710
I'll find him, wherever he is,

03:29.743 --> 03:33.281
I... I've been on tour with
The Slut Puppets my entire life,

03:33.314 --> 03:35.283
I deserve to know
what else is out there,

03:35.316 --> 03:39.620
I mean he could be a doctor,
or a lawyer, or a politician.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.823
Yeah, right. No such luck.
He owns a weed shop.

03:43.691 --> 03:44.892
What?

03:44.925 --> 03:47.695
In Amsterdam, it's called,
Kalifornia Dreamin'.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.765
Amsterdam.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.200
Is he still there?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.336
[scoffs]

03:55.369 --> 03:58.071
Who knows. I mean,
it was over 20 years ago,

03:58.105 --> 04:02.510
but you're right, Jack,
you deserve to know.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.721
Keep it.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.692
His name's Michael Kali.

04:21.261 --> 04:25.566
- That's my dad?
- Happy Birthday, Jack.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.504
Right, come on, I better go.

04:31.905 --> 04:35.343
Oh, and, um...
if by some strange chance,

04:35.376 --> 04:39.079
you're not here by the time
we get off stage,
be careful, yeah?

04:39.112 --> 04:42.416
Amsterdam is one hell of a city.

04:42.450 --> 04:47.120
[narrator] He had spent his
entire life dreaming about
someday meeting his father,

04:47.154 --> 04:51.659
and now he held
that possibility in
the palm of his hand.

04:51.692 --> 04:56.864
This is a very special story
about a boy named Jack.

04:56.897 --> 05:00.200
[rock music plays]

06:51.645 --> 06:55.483
Hello, handsome boy,
what are you looking for?

06:55.516 --> 07:01.489
Hello, I'm looking for
this place, I believe
it's a coffee shop.

07:01.522 --> 07:06.894
Why don't you come inside
and we can find what ever
you're looking for.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.329
[chuckles]
I'm alright, thanks.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.264
You don't want to
play with Miss Misha?

07:11.298 --> 07:17.404
- Um... no, thank you.
- Well, piss off!
You ruin business!

07:18.405 --> 07:20.874
[woman yelling in Dutch]

07:24.678 --> 07:26.647
[narrator]
Even if he understood Dutch,

07:26.680 --> 07:29.917
Jack wouldn't of heard
a word she was saying,

07:29.950 --> 07:33.521
it was love at first sight.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.527
Sorry, what?

07:39.560 --> 07:43.396
Another tourist. Stay out of
the bicycle lane, okay?!

07:43.430 --> 07:44.898
[vehicle approaches]

07:44.932 --> 07:45.933
[horn honks]

07:45.966 --> 07:48.802
Hey! Goedemorgen, Desiree.

07:48.836 --> 07:52.606
- Is it?
- Ja! Hm, finally
allowed a boyfriend?

07:52.640 --> 07:55.042
No, just another
tourist on pussy patrol.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.010
- I'm not...
- Ha! Hey, well...

07:58.612 --> 08:00.080
I think she likes you.

08:02.049 --> 08:05.553
Don't waste
your precious pennies
upon the window dwellers.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.589
The "Hidden-Extra's" are free.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.792
Well, I must dash, the cobbles
won't litter themselves.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.894
- [engine revs]
- [laughing]

08:17.230 --> 08:18.866
Sorry, I've gotta go.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.003
[yells in Dutch]

08:36.850 --> 08:37.918
Shit.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.386
[panting]

09:09.549 --> 09:11.518
[upbeat music playing]

09:11.551 --> 09:14.387
[people chattering]

09:16.456 --> 09:19.259
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.061
[chuckles]

09:39.613 --> 09:41.414
[bell dings]

09:42.215 --> 09:43.684
[squealing]

09:45.085 --> 09:48.021
* Welcome to The Giant,
you're here to smoke the best *

09:48.055 --> 09:50.357
- * We have the weed.
- * And seeds and hash

09:50.390 --> 09:51.959
* That stands above the rest

09:51.992 --> 09:53.794
* Perhaps the old
skunk number one? *

09:53.827 --> 09:55.829
* For a retro taste
upon thou tongue *

09:55.863 --> 09:57.731
* Something from
the indica section? *

09:57.765 --> 10:01.869
* Or puff upon
a sativa erection? *

10:01.902 --> 10:05.472
* Anything you wish is here
to help your mind expand *

10:05.505 --> 10:09.309
* The Jolly Green Giant
has the best weed in the land *

10:09.342 --> 10:11.611
Right, then,
what will it be, my lord?

10:11.645 --> 10:15.649
Wow! Um, well, I was wondering
if you could help me?

10:15.683 --> 10:21.088
I'm looking for Michael Kali,
and I think he owns the
coffee shop across the road.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.390
- Shut your mouth, boy.
- The nerve!

10:23.423 --> 10:27.260
- Say that name
one more time and...
- I'll bite your dick off!

10:27.294 --> 10:31.131
Clarence, Pipa, it's a bit early
for theatrics, don't you think?

10:36.837 --> 10:39.272
- Sorry about them.
- No, I should be...

10:39.306 --> 10:43.777
- Wait.
- Apologizing to you.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.713
- You were saying?
- I want to...

10:45.746 --> 10:48.581
- Gauze my lord?
- Apologize for earlier,

10:48.615 --> 10:53.954
everything that happened
with that lady, and on
your bicycle... that stuff.

10:53.987 --> 10:58.058
Oh, wait,
you're the fucking tourist!
Thanks for all the help!

10:58.091 --> 11:00.994
Yeah, I'm really sorry.
What it is, I'm looking
for somebody and,

11:01.028 --> 11:03.196
and when your mate turned up
on the...
[makes bike noises]

11:03.230 --> 11:04.597
And his goggles up,

11:04.631 --> 11:07.667
and I could see, and I needed
to chase him, but I've lost him.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.837
So I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to
find the guy I'm looking for.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.741
You've been smoking
a little too much today, huh?

11:13.774 --> 11:17.510
No, I wish, I mean,
I've been really busy.

11:17.544 --> 11:21.514
Shhh... this is not the joint
you are looking for.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.185
- [groans]
- Sorry.

11:34.061 --> 11:37.097
- I'm Desiree.
- I'm Jack.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.801
- Welcome to Amsterdam.
- Thanks.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.272
[coughing]

11:45.305 --> 11:48.208
[giggles]
Slow down, it's not a race.

11:50.410 --> 11:56.016
- So, what's with the lighter?
- It's my dad's, um...

11:56.049 --> 11:57.584
I think he owns
that coffee shop over the road.

11:57.617 --> 12:02.489
Whoa, Mick Kali is your father?
I didn't know he had a son!

12:02.522 --> 12:04.257
Not sure he knows either.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.592
[trumpet blowing]

12:05.625 --> 12:09.629
Hear ye, hear ye, the king
has returned victorious!

12:09.662 --> 12:12.599
- [all cheering]
- He has fucking done it again!

12:12.632 --> 12:17.104
Once again,
the Amsterdam Cup will be
held here at the infamous,

12:17.137 --> 12:19.339
Jolly Green Giant!

12:22.409 --> 12:25.879
And once again,
the top prize will be mine!

12:35.956 --> 12:39.492
- Who is this then?
- I'm Jack.

12:39.526 --> 12:43.230
It's nice to meet you mister...
it's nice to meet you, sir.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.101
Allow me.

12:57.878 --> 13:01.148
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I was just lighting your pipe.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.582
- Uncle, he doesn't know any b...
- Rustige.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.384
- He's Mick's son.
- I said quiet!

13:07.354 --> 13:09.189
Mick's son, huh?

13:09.222 --> 13:12.692
That's funny,
why didn't I realize this?

13:12.725 --> 13:15.963
Cause he actually looks
a lot like Mick's son.

13:15.996 --> 13:19.066
- Really?
- Yeah, you know, sad.

13:20.367 --> 13:24.504
Pathetic, like a loser.

13:24.537 --> 13:28.976
You're smoking on the wrong side
of the street, boy.

13:29.009 --> 13:34.747
[clears throat] Uh... It was...
nice to meet you, Desiree.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.485
Didn't have to be so mean.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.355
He's Mick's son,
he ought to get used to knowing

13:42.389 --> 13:44.357
his place in the world.

13:44.391 --> 13:50.230
Ahh... you saucy smokers.
Free weed for these beauties.

13:51.631 --> 13:54.834
Come and see me later
for a smoke...

13:57.737 --> 13:59.406
and a poke.

14:12.252 --> 14:18.992
- Jack, wait! Excuse my uncle.
- I thought my mom was bad.

14:19.026 --> 14:22.129
I think it's really nice
you want to find your dad.

14:22.162 --> 14:25.098
Go see this show,
you'll find him there.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.134
My dad hangs out
at a sex show?

14:27.167 --> 14:30.037
[chuckles] Grow up, little boy,
this is Amsterdam.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.274
See you around.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.898
[rock music playing]

15:05.005 --> 15:06.473
[cheering]

15:10.477 --> 15:15.648
Thank you so much! Thank you
so much, Blowback Beth.

15:15.682 --> 15:19.252
As always,
you truly blew us away.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.222
[laughs]

15:22.255 --> 15:26.426
No? I sincerely hoped you used
the gash-tray.

15:27.961 --> 15:31.831
No? Okay, well, it doesn't
matter, time for the main event!

15:31.864 --> 15:36.103
Oh, yes! Ladies and gentlemen,

15:36.136 --> 15:41.941
please give it up
for the Red Light delight,

15:41.975 --> 15:47.880
Miss Hidden-Extra Heidi!

15:47.914 --> 15:51.284
[men cheering]

15:51.318 --> 15:54.554
What's wrong, Heidi?
What's that?

15:54.587 --> 15:58.425
You require a volunteer?
Okay, let's find one.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.094
- Fuck this.
- [whooping]

16:01.128 --> 16:04.797
And we have one! A natural
selection, thank you, dear boy.

16:04.831 --> 16:09.769
- No, no, I was just leaving.
- Oh, no!
Don't keep him waiting.

16:12.039 --> 16:15.408
- I was...
I'm just looking for my dad.
- Looking for your dad?

16:15.442 --> 16:18.211
Well, there's plenty of fathers
in here tonight.
[chuckles]

16:18.245 --> 16:21.148
Heidi, my sweetling,
he's all yours.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.850
- [men cheering]
- [upbeat dance music plays]

16:41.034 --> 16:45.438
- Mick? Mick!
- It's Heidi, kid.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.741
[narrator] Jack couldn't help
but smile a little,

16:48.775 --> 16:54.081
it's not quite who he'd
expected, but he'd finally
found his father.

16:54.114 --> 16:57.484
- You're Mick Kali aren't ya?
- Shut up, kid.
We're almost finished.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.487
My name's Jack.
I think you're my dad.

17:12.632 --> 17:16.269
Mick? Wait, wait!

17:16.303 --> 17:18.605
- Wait, please!
- Leave me alone!

17:18.637 --> 17:22.942
Just, listen to me... Sorry.
Listen to me for a second!

17:22.974 --> 17:25.078
- Come on!
- Stop following me, man.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.714
If you just gave me
a chance to explain!

17:27.747 --> 17:29.349
Just go away!

17:29.382 --> 17:31.118
[tires screeching]

17:31.151 --> 17:35.122
The fucking bikes in the place!
Mick, wait!

17:35.988 --> 17:40.393
Please wait, just...
Dad, wait!

17:40.427 --> 17:44.397
Don't call me that, man!
I've never seen you
before in my life.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.599
Then what's this?

17:48.735 --> 17:51.938
My mom gave this to me,
and you gave it to her.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.107
Her name's Roxy,
she's in a band called...

17:54.141 --> 17:55.508
[both] The Slut Puppets.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.611
Yeah!
You knew her a long time ago.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.385
I got no idea
what you're talking about, man.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.702
[muffled grunt]

18:22.735 --> 18:25.272
- [horn honking]
- [vehicle approaching]

18:36.549 --> 18:39.286
Bonsoir, my dedicated
herbal connoisseur.

18:39.319 --> 18:45.292
Now, I'm afraid that I must be
the bearer of bad news,
but our fair establishment,

18:45.325 --> 18:49.462
right there, is closed for the
evening. Now might I suggest...

18:49.496 --> 18:54.066
- Hey!
You're the guy from the show.
- Yeah.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.035
- Hello.
- I'm Jack.

18:56.068 --> 18:59.339
Well, pleased to meet you, Jack.
My name is Loz.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.809
[animated noises]

19:02.842 --> 19:07.614
"Oh, hello."
Oh, MJ, you've just met him.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.349
Sorry about MJ,
I think she likes you.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.352
Ay? What do you like,
what do you like...

19:14.954 --> 19:18.558
It's probably because
she knows I'm Mick's son.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.761
Michael? Son!

19:25.365 --> 19:29.369
Michael. Jack. Son!

19:29.869 --> 19:31.771
[laughing]

19:34.040 --> 19:38.077
Nothing? Well, I didn't realize
Michael had a son.

19:38.110 --> 19:41.581
We must celebrate! With a feast!

19:41.614 --> 19:46.085
What's, what's that, Mary Jane?
Mary Jane what a wonderful idea.

19:46.118 --> 19:49.088
You're so clever
let me get the ingredients.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.690
Care for a shroomy snack?

19:50.723 --> 19:54.994
- Uh, nah.
- You want some?

19:55.027 --> 19:58.798
Oh, be careful,
save some for Daddy, my sweet.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.238
[chewing]
They're really good.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.208
[narrator]
Loz was insanely jealous

20:09.242 --> 20:11.878
of the poor animals
in testing laboratories,

20:11.911 --> 20:16.048
merely because they're
experimenting with more drugs
than he is.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.284
Experimenting?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.018
But it seemed
he was giving those

20:19.051 --> 20:22.154
poor, furry bastards
a run for their money.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.724
[narrator laughing]

20:24.757 --> 20:27.894
- Stop snickering!
- Who you talking to?

20:27.927 --> 20:31.531
- Nobody! Who you talking to?
- You.

20:31.564 --> 20:38.305
- Yes.
So, how can we help you, mister?
- Why do ya wanna help me?

20:38.338 --> 20:41.274
Cause we're friends?
[chuckles]

20:41.308 --> 20:43.810
- Aren't we?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.480
I gotta get out of here.

20:47.514 --> 20:51.584
- Sure, care for
a bit of company? "Hello."
- No, thanks.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.786
No. Okay. Fine.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.556
Well, it's just me and you, MJ.

20:56.589 --> 21:01.160
Me, you and...
that small bi-sexual elephant.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.531
Me?
[chuckles]

21:56.282 --> 21:58.351
[car horn honking]

21:59.151 --> 22:01.354
[woman whimpering]

22:02.088 --> 22:03.756
Oh, my God.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.627
What happened?

22:07.660 --> 22:10.897
This guy robbed me, and he took
my bag and all my things.

22:10.930 --> 22:16.836
- It's okay. I'll help you.
- Thank you, you're so kind.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.005
Okay.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.480
Are you a tourist?

22:28.114 --> 22:30.082
No, I live here.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.452
[laughing]

22:32.485 --> 22:35.455
Comedian?
Then what's with the bag?

22:36.188 --> 22:38.625
Just some things.

22:38.658 --> 22:41.428
You give this to us, tourist,
or we make a smile in your neck.

22:41.461 --> 22:46.098
All right. Okay. Take it.
Alright, okay.

22:49.402 --> 22:51.804
Now let's see
what's in his wallet.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.906
No!

22:53.940 --> 22:57.977
- Get away from him!
- What are you gonna do,
old man?

22:58.010 --> 23:02.381
What am I gonna do?
Allow me to demonstrate!

23:02.849 --> 23:04.784
[yelling]

23:07.554 --> 23:10.723
You're lucky
I don't need to shit!

23:10.757 --> 23:12.825
[grunting]

23:18.465 --> 23:23.836
Oh, my house. My house!

23:23.870 --> 23:27.607
- You saved me.
- And you crushed my house,
Jack.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.512
I owe you
for helping me and I...

23:33.880 --> 23:35.782
Wait did you just call me Jack?

23:35.815 --> 23:39.652
You have proper fucked it up.

23:39.686 --> 23:43.756
- I'm sure
you'll find another one.
- Are you blind? I'm blind.

23:43.790 --> 23:48.060
- Oh, sorry.
- Aye, well apologies
aren't a gonna stop

23:48.094 --> 23:50.763
the rats from biting me in the
arse, are they, Jack, eh?

23:54.100 --> 23:56.569
You just called me Jack,
how do you know my name?

23:56.603 --> 23:59.572
- That's your name, Jack.
- You said it again!

23:59.606 --> 24:00.773
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

24:00.807 --> 24:02.341
[laughing]

24:02.374 --> 24:06.546
- No, I mean,
you said it before that.
- Shhh, shhh.

24:06.579 --> 24:09.716
[siren blaring]

24:09.749 --> 24:11.684
- Look.
- I cannot see.

24:11.718 --> 24:15.855
No, I mean, listen, I...

24:15.888 --> 24:18.024
I haven't got any cash.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.961
I wanna give you something.

24:23.863 --> 24:27.466
Ah, yeah,
that looks expensive, eh?

24:33.640 --> 24:37.710
Not all
who are blind cannot see.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.525
Take it.
Means nothing to me anymore.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.628
Are you sure?

24:55.662 --> 24:57.029
Yeah.

24:59.265 --> 25:01.701
It's worth more
to you than it is to me.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.407
[groans]

25:08.440 --> 25:09.642
I'm sorry about your house.

25:09.676 --> 25:15.715
Wait! You're a good boy, Jack,
a good boy.

25:18.951 --> 25:19.952
What's that?

25:19.986 --> 25:23.055
That... is a seed.

25:23.089 --> 25:26.626
But it's not like
any other seed in the world.

25:26.659 --> 25:30.997
Take care of it...
on your journey.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.306
What kinda seed?

25:43.309 --> 25:44.811
Where'd he go?

26:05.564 --> 26:08.167
- [soft music playing]
- [grunts]

26:18.811 --> 26:21.513
You are wondering,
where you are,

26:21.547 --> 26:25.451
how you got here and who I am.

26:25.484 --> 26:28.621
Well, uh... yeah.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.723
Where am I?

26:30.757 --> 26:35.461
- Four degrees north.
- Oh, God, there's another one.

26:35.494 --> 26:37.563
[heavy breathing noises]

26:37.596 --> 26:41.968
Two degrees east.
Permission to land.

26:42.001 --> 26:44.637
Permission granted.
Bring her in.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.173
Zero degrees south.

26:52.544 --> 26:54.213
Touchdown.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.120
Morning, Jack.

27:01.153 --> 27:03.690
How'd you guys know my name?
Are you psychic?

27:03.723 --> 27:09.361
- Nah, Loz told us.
- Wait a minute,
you guys know Loz?

27:09.395 --> 27:12.699
I am Spencer.
I am his elder sibling.

27:12.732 --> 27:16.135
This, this is our humble abode.

27:18.537 --> 27:20.707
We failed again, captain.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.143
[sniffing]

27:25.177 --> 27:27.279
[coughs]

27:31.550 --> 27:32.785
What was that?

27:32.819 --> 27:35.054
Another ghastly attempt.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.522
Well, what you trying to make?

27:36.555 --> 27:41.928
- Going to make.
- The ultimate high.

27:41.961 --> 27:45.464
We do not know who wrote this,
but it is clear he was

27:45.497 --> 27:49.301
a master
of the horticultural arts.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.271
- Only trouble is...
- We're missing the last page.

27:52.304 --> 27:56.242
But that shall not deter us,
from our quest.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.010
[chuckles]
Oh, no...

27:59.111 --> 28:00.546
Bonjour, mes amis!

28:00.579 --> 28:03.582
- Good, Loz is here.
- [Loz] Bon appétit.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.953
- Goedemorgen, Jack!
- Right.

28:06.986 --> 28:08.755
- Mon frère.
- Loz.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.723
What happened last night?
How did I get here?

28:10.757 --> 28:15.061
Ooh! Well, I wasn't really too
sure whether to leave you
sleeping where I found you

28:15.094 --> 28:18.831
because you looked so cute
and peaceful in the gutter.

28:18.865 --> 28:21.067
[making meowing noises]

28:24.170 --> 28:25.304
That bag.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.909
I know, right! Like, wow.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.912
Ten euros from this rather
lovely couple.

28:32.945 --> 28:35.114
"Ooh, I'd like ten euros."
"Oh, well, here's a bag."

28:35.147 --> 28:36.983
No, that's my bag!

28:37.016 --> 28:39.318
Oh, I think you're mistaken,
sir.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.888
You tryin' to tickle me?
Stop it!

28:41.921 --> 28:44.991
I was robbed last night.
This is my bag.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.495
They've taken all my stuff!

28:50.262 --> 28:52.298
[grunts] Merde!

28:52.331 --> 28:56.903
But, in my defense,
it was empty when I bought it.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.976
You're wearing all my clothes.

29:06.212 --> 29:08.180
Okay fine, it wasn't "empty",

29:08.214 --> 29:11.851
I did find these inside,
too, but rather fetching
don't you think?

29:11.884 --> 29:13.619
- [guys laughing]
- Yes. Yes.

29:13.652 --> 29:18.724
That's some futuristic
shit right there! Yeah! Yo.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.893
[singing tune]

29:25.431 --> 29:28.534
* I like to smoke
in my mouth *

29:28.567 --> 29:32.004
* That is where the smoke
goes inside *

29:32.038 --> 29:35.407
* Pete,
where does the smoke go? *

29:35.441 --> 29:40.146
* It goes down my throat
then to my lungs *

29:40.179 --> 29:42.648
* Then it goes up to my brain

29:42.681 --> 29:43.983
[squawks]

29:44.016 --> 29:49.421
* I'm really high
and then it goes to Spence *

29:52.324 --> 29:55.427
* This is my friend
I like him very much *

29:55.461 --> 29:58.865
* This is my friend
he teaches me so much *

29:58.898 --> 30:00.032
* This is my friend...

30:00.066 --> 30:01.600
- What?
- * I'll pass it to you

30:01.633 --> 30:05.237
* But you have to earn it
by singing to us *

30:07.907 --> 30:10.910
* I was robbed last night
and they... *

30:11.577 --> 30:14.113
took everything.

30:15.747 --> 30:18.584
I mean my passport
was in that bag.

30:18.617 --> 30:19.818
Wow.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.754
- That was awkward.
- Yup.

30:24.756 --> 30:29.996
- Oh, man.
- Hey, come on, dear Jacques,
here you go. Meow, meow, meow.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.630
Chin up and smiley smiles,

30:31.663 --> 30:33.866
there's a whole world
of positivity out there.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.668
[chuckles]
Yeah.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.972
[yelling]

30:40.006 --> 30:43.075
Be a friend, yeah?
I must get all of these
on the cobbles today.

30:47.746 --> 30:49.448
"Amsterdam Cup?"

30:49.481 --> 30:54.253
[laughing]
Jacques, it's more than a cup,
it's the World Cup of weed!

30:54.286 --> 30:58.057
Coffee shop owners do battle
over several intense rounds

30:58.090 --> 31:00.893
to be the greatest herbalist
in the world!

31:00.927 --> 31:04.363
Your father,
he used to be the champ-ee-on,

31:04.396 --> 31:06.298
before his
so-called "friend", Eddie,

31:06.332 --> 31:09.601
unveiled his corporate
monstrosity across the street.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.237
[tires screeching]

31:11.270 --> 31:14.106
[yells indistinct]

31:14.140 --> 31:19.311
Anyway...
[speaking French]

31:29.721 --> 31:34.626
- Oh shh... I'm I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- Fucking deja-vu!

31:34.660 --> 31:36.695
You know, some people
might call this fate.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.265
Or a clumsy idiot who needs
to look where he's going.

31:47.606 --> 31:48.807
Look who I found?

31:50.609 --> 31:51.910
Hi.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.585
Michael!

32:02.688 --> 32:04.923
How's things going
with your dad?

32:04.957 --> 32:06.025
It's a mess.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.127
- [clattering]
- [screaming]

32:08.160 --> 32:11.030
Don't worry, there's always
someone worse off than you.

32:35.754 --> 32:37.289
Mick...

32:38.257 --> 32:40.759
- I know you don't believe me.
- Fuck.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.597
I know this is hard to take in.

32:48.567 --> 32:52.838
But you did know my mom
a long time ago,

32:52.871 --> 32:58.877
and my... my aunt Pixie
told me that you are my father.

33:02.414 --> 33:03.882
Mick.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.356
I know.

33:10.389 --> 33:12.191
[soft chuckle]

33:15.861 --> 33:19.098
Your mother wrote to me when she
found out she was pregnant.

33:22.901 --> 33:26.872
I tried to contact her, man.
She was, she was always on tour,

33:26.905 --> 33:28.574
always moving place to place.

33:30.509 --> 33:34.012
I spent six months
trying to get a letter to her.

33:35.814 --> 33:38.484
But you can tell her she's not
getting any money off me, man.

33:39.985 --> 33:42.721
- That's why she sent you right?
- No, she...

33:42.754 --> 33:45.524
Well, good 'cause
I don't have any to give, man.

33:45.557 --> 33:48.194
I'll be closing the shop
within a month.

33:48.227 --> 33:51.930
Yeah,
Loz mentioned things were bad.

33:51.963 --> 33:56.135
MJ, MJ, I found some treasure.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.970
Look, a spliff.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.007
Help me, MJ.

34:02.040 --> 34:07.012
Look, you came to see the show?
Okay? You saw how shit it is.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.447
All right, now just run along

34:09.481 --> 34:12.918
and get as far away from me
as possible, man.

34:12.951 --> 34:16.255
No, I thought maybe
I could stay and help you?

34:16.288 --> 34:20.726
Help? I can't even
look after this place
let alone babysit you.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.295
I'm a fast learner. I mean there
must be something I can do?

34:23.329 --> 34:27.366
What? What do you possibly think
you could do to help me, man?

34:33.339 --> 34:36.308
Actually, there is one thing.

34:36.342 --> 34:37.809
Anything, name it.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.746
The lighter.
It's solid gold, man.

34:41.780 --> 34:45.551
Platinum inlay,
the sparkly bit in the lettering
is a sapphire, dude.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.587
I had it made when I opened
the shop, it's worth a mint.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.422
[both laughing]

34:51.456 --> 34:53.024
C'mon, give it here.

34:55.226 --> 34:59.365
Uh... here's the thing, um...

35:00.466 --> 35:06.405
I don't...
currently have it anymore.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.475
- What do you mean?
- I was robbed last night.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.610
- They took if off you?
- No...

35:13.379 --> 35:17.149
This blind homeless guy,
came up out of the trash

35:17.183 --> 35:18.884
and pissed on the robbers
and saved me!

35:18.917 --> 35:21.187
But I destroyed his house
so I had to give him something

35:21.220 --> 35:24.423
so I gave him... the lighter.

35:24.456 --> 35:27.859
You gave...
my lighter... to a bum?

35:27.893 --> 35:31.597
I... I gave my bum a light once,
didn't end well.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.366
You two have totally
lost the plot, man!

35:34.400 --> 35:38.103
No, no, no, look.
He gave me his seed.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.139
Mick. Dude, just look at it.

35:44.710 --> 35:47.913
I'm sorry, look I didn't
realize, I'll go get it back!

35:47.946 --> 35:49.615
You've done enough, sunshine!

35:53.819 --> 35:55.454
I want you gone, pronto.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.689
- I don't have anywhere to go.
- Go back to your mother.

35:57.723 --> 36:00.926
I don't have a mother
to go back to!

36:00.959 --> 36:03.262
What?

36:03.295 --> 36:07.199
- Sorry it's just,
you know, Roxy.
- She's dead?

36:07.233 --> 36:08.133
What?

36:08.166 --> 36:13.239
Oh, man.
I'm so sorry, Jack.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.608
I'm so sorry, man.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.211
I didn't know.

36:19.245 --> 36:21.680
[narrator]
Jack felt terrible about lying,

36:21.713 --> 36:25.083
but for the first time he was
being held by his father,

36:25.116 --> 36:29.421
and he couldn't bring himself
to give that up just yet.

36:30.589 --> 36:33.124
You stay with me for a little
while, yeah?

36:34.192 --> 36:35.561
That'd be awesome.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.466
Lying about what?

36:40.499 --> 36:44.736
- Is he all right?
- Yeah. He's okay.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.805
[chuckles]

36:51.510 --> 36:52.711
Don't wait up.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.880
[laughing]

36:56.047 --> 36:59.851
Oh, you can laugh,
but this right here,

37:01.152 --> 37:04.256
is what keeps the crowd
gagging for more.

37:04.290 --> 37:07.326
Hundred euro bills, y'all.

37:11.763 --> 37:16.435
- Later, dudes.
- His balls touched me.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.804
[door closes]

37:18.837 --> 37:22.040
- His balls touch everyone.
- [laughing]

37:22.073 --> 37:24.510
Yeah. Yes.

37:24.543 --> 37:27.413
[piano plays over
muted dialogue]

37:53.672 --> 37:56.041
Jack. Jack!

37:57.242 --> 38:02.881
People watching me.
Jack, do you see 'em? Jack.
Ja...

38:33.178 --> 38:35.847
[rumbling]

38:40.886 --> 38:44.255
[rumbling gets louder]

39:02.674 --> 39:06.277
- Jack. Jack!
- What?

39:06.311 --> 39:09.681
Wake up.
Open your eyes, man.

39:18.857 --> 39:19.991
Whoa.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.461
Dude.

39:49.821 --> 39:53.391
Holy shit! What happened?

39:53.425 --> 39:56.595
It had to be that seed,
my beautiful boy!

39:56.628 --> 39:58.764
We flushed that
down the toilet.

39:58.797 --> 40:02.701
I know and it grew into
a monster, man!

40:05.336 --> 40:09.007
[grunts]
Hi. Yeah a little help
for a friend? I'm stuck!

40:12.911 --> 40:15.547
Be careful!
Don't disturb the root.

40:16.648 --> 40:18.617
[Desiree]
Jack?

40:18.650 --> 40:21.319
- Shit, that's Desiree.
- [Mick] What's she doing here?

40:21.352 --> 40:23.722
- Jack!
- I'm stuck, Desiree...

40:23.755 --> 40:25.524
Shhh!

40:25.557 --> 40:27.125
- She can't see it!
- Okay.

40:27.158 --> 40:28.426
Not me, dude.

40:28.460 --> 40:29.995
- Get rid of her.
- How?

40:30.028 --> 40:31.096
I don't know say anything!

40:31.129 --> 40:32.664
If you really wanna
help me save the shop,

40:32.698 --> 40:35.366
Eddie can't find out
about this, man!

40:35.400 --> 40:37.569
- Ooh! Hey.
- Hi.

40:37.603 --> 40:40.071
- Is everything...
- It's fine.
Everything's fine.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.643
- Let's go somewhere!
- Where?

40:44.676 --> 40:47.112
Uh, anywhere.
Just away from the stores.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.347
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah!

41:00.125 --> 41:02.460
Who's a cunt?

41:07.198 --> 41:10.168
[upbeat music plays
over muted dialogue]

42:00.952 --> 42:05.056
- [cartoon noises]
- [giggling]

42:07.959 --> 42:13.064
Amsterdam is crazy,
it's just coffee shops and sex.

42:14.733 --> 42:18.436
- I'm gonna miss this place.
- Why? Where you going?

42:22.641 --> 42:25.677
- Can you keep a secret?
- Sure.

42:34.586 --> 42:36.855
[Desiree] These are all
the places I'm going to go see,

42:36.888 --> 42:38.556
the minute I turn 21.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.391
Eddie's no longer
my legal guardian,

42:40.425 --> 42:44.029
I'm buying a ticket to somewhere
on this map, and I'm off.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.330
[makes whooshing sound]

42:46.698 --> 42:48.066
That's great.

42:50.235 --> 42:52.503
[rock music playing]

43:04.282 --> 43:06.284
You're listening to
one of Mom's records.

43:09.921 --> 43:14.793
- You've been gone a while.
- Yeah, she took me to
the Erotic Museum.

43:14.826 --> 43:18.063
I asked you to get her
away from the store,
not go on a date, man!

43:18.096 --> 43:21.266
- We had a really cool time.
- Stay away from that girl,

43:21.299 --> 43:25.236
- she's nothing but trouble.
- [Jack] No, she's not.
She's really nice.

43:25.270 --> 43:26.972
- Loz!
- What?

43:27.005 --> 43:31.910
She took you on a date
to an erotic museum, man! Loz!

43:31.943 --> 43:34.245
Not a date.

43:34.279 --> 43:38.183
Listen, anybody related to Eddie
is no friend of ours.

43:38.216 --> 43:39.651
Do you understand?

43:39.685 --> 43:41.953
- Loz, stop that!
- [Loz] Please, Michael!

43:41.987 --> 43:44.422
Just let us smoke a little bit.
Just a little tiny bit.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.825
An itty-bitty, tokey-wokey.

43:46.858 --> 43:51.262
No! We cannot smoke this,
or sell it for that matter,

43:51.296 --> 43:53.098
until we're sure
what the hell it is.

43:53.131 --> 43:55.066
"Don't smoke it, don't sell it."

43:56.134 --> 43:59.070
- Hey!
- Sorry.

43:59.104 --> 44:00.505
- Loz.
- Yes?

44:00.538 --> 44:03.474
What about your brother
and that astronaut?

44:03.508 --> 44:07.846
But of course!
Pete and Spence must see this!

44:08.646 --> 44:11.049
To our noble steed, we ride!

44:11.082 --> 44:16.955
Yes! Loz, clip the bud.
Let's do this!

44:58.263 --> 45:01.332
I have never
seen anything like it.

45:01.366 --> 45:02.801
Is it safe?

45:02.834 --> 45:06.537
Should be, though you will be in
for the ride of your life.

45:06.571 --> 45:09.741
- And ride, we shall.
- Where did you get this?

45:09.775 --> 45:12.277
I was about
to ask you the same question.

45:12.310 --> 45:14.746
We found it
in the trash months ago.

45:14.780 --> 45:18.416
Bestowed upon us
by destiny, Pete.

45:18.449 --> 45:23.088
We have been trying to complete
the procedure, but we are
missing the last page.

45:23.121 --> 45:31.396
- Whoever wrote it is a genius.
- Yes, he was.

45:31.429 --> 45:38.103
- You know who wrote that?
- Of course.
He used to work for me.

45:38.136 --> 45:44.675
Years ago, when Eddie and I
were running Kalifornia Dreamin'
together,

45:44.709 --> 45:51.182
we had a scientist,
Gordon the Great.

45:52.583 --> 45:55.987
The best horticulturist
that Amsterdam had ever seen.

45:57.488 --> 46:00.025
He created all of our strains.

46:01.126 --> 46:05.730
But Gordon...
was after the ultimate high.

46:06.898 --> 46:10.936
- The Iceolator.
- The Iceolator?

46:10.969 --> 46:17.508
He worked through the night
for months, trying to perfect
the technique.

46:17.542 --> 46:24.482
Eddie grew impatient,
he wanted the strain
for the Amsterdam Cup.

46:25.583 --> 46:28.553
He snuck into the lab one night,

46:28.586 --> 46:32.323
and turned the grow lamps
up past their top capacity.

46:33.324 --> 46:34.893
Then what happened?

46:35.660 --> 46:37.628
[makes exploding sound]

46:37.662 --> 46:39.097
It exploded.

46:39.130 --> 46:40.698
[makes soft exploding sound]

46:41.900 --> 46:44.002
When we returned in the morning

46:44.035 --> 46:47.906
our lab was destroyed
and our beloved scientist...

46:48.673 --> 46:51.142
nowhere to be found.

46:51.176 --> 46:53.278
His notes were lost, too...

46:56.581 --> 46:58.049
until today.

46:58.083 --> 47:00.818
So, that's when you
and Eddie split up?

47:00.852 --> 47:03.421
He didn't care
that somebody died, man!

47:03.454 --> 47:07.525
He just wanted to win the cup.
I said, no.

47:07.558 --> 47:08.894
No.

47:08.927 --> 47:11.863
Greed drove a wedge between us,

47:13.464 --> 47:18.236
and he opened the Jolly Green
Giant across the road.

47:18.269 --> 47:21.806
And ever since he's been trying
to put me in the poor house.

47:21.839 --> 47:27.612
But now that you have this...
What are you calling it?

47:27.645 --> 47:30.381
- Oh.
- That's a good question.

47:36.421 --> 47:41.026
- The Green Stalk.
- Yes, Loz! That's great!

47:41.626 --> 47:42.827
What is?

47:45.596 --> 47:50.601
If this... "Green Stalk"

47:50.635 --> 47:53.071
is as good as you say it is,

47:54.272 --> 47:56.874
we could save the shop.

47:56.908 --> 47:59.644
- Which would be awesome.
- [all giggling]

47:59.677 --> 48:02.313
Only one way to find out.

48:18.496 --> 48:20.865
[bubbling and burning]

48:35.180 --> 48:38.116
[upbeat music plays]

49:22.493 --> 49:25.630
In all my years
of mind expansion,

49:25.663 --> 49:28.933
I never believed
I would experience such beauty.

49:28.966 --> 49:32.803
This is our savior.

49:37.108 --> 49:39.510
[upbeat music plays]

50:54.252 --> 50:55.886
[indistinct chatter]

50:58.323 --> 51:02.693
[narrator]
The Green Stalk was indeed the
savior for Kalifornia Dreamin',

51:02.727 --> 51:03.794
[bell ringing]

51:03.828 --> 51:05.963
But their success
was Eddie's demise.

51:05.996 --> 51:09.767
The Jolly Green Giant hadn't
seen a customer for weeks,

51:09.800 --> 51:13.404
and the Amsterdam Cup
was merely days away.

51:20.578 --> 51:22.180
Fuck this!

51:24.749 --> 51:27.785
It's time I made a trip
across the cobbles.

51:29.254 --> 51:31.722
Clarence! Pipa!

51:32.123 --> 51:33.858
[grunts]

51:33.891 --> 51:36.026
Ready my transport.

52:28.679 --> 52:29.880
Traitors!

52:29.914 --> 52:32.583
[people chattering]

52:40.057 --> 52:42.026
What the fuck is this?

52:42.059 --> 52:44.362
Smoking on the wrong side
of the street, aren't ya?

52:47.732 --> 52:53.871
Mind your cheek, boy,
and stay away from my princess.

52:53.904 --> 52:59.710
If you so much as to lick
her rolling papers...

52:59.744 --> 53:03.548
Hey. Haven't you got
trophies to polish?

53:03.581 --> 53:05.983
Well, if it isn't
Hidden-Extra Heidi herself.

53:06.016 --> 53:09.554
You come to protect your
little boy? That's so sweet.

53:11.322 --> 53:17.094
I can smell the sweat
of your tiny balls, Mickie.

53:17.127 --> 53:21.666
'Tis a shame
that they are not big enough
to compete with a champion.

53:22.933 --> 53:26.003
Well, at least
my dad's balls work.

53:32.076 --> 53:35.713
My balls work.

53:36.547 --> 53:41.586
They like to sweat.

53:46.991 --> 53:50.261
And they like to grind.

53:52.630 --> 53:55.466
[huffing]

54:07.978 --> 54:12.650
Unlike you, you pathetic loser,
too afraid for competition.

54:12.683 --> 54:17.788
No, I don't have time for
the cup and all... that.

54:17.822 --> 54:21.792
I'm too busy swinging from
branch to branch of my tree,

54:21.826 --> 54:25.262
serving the millions
of customers that
come in here every day.

54:25.296 --> 54:30.635
Another piece of your
plastic shit to go with
your fake palm trees?

54:30.668 --> 54:33.904
Oh, it's real.
Just ask them.

54:37.375 --> 54:39.744
- That is real?
- Yeah.

54:39.777 --> 54:45.616
- No. That is impossible.
- Loz! Green stuff.

54:47.785 --> 54:49.086
On the house.

54:52.022 --> 54:55.760
Some stupid, homegrown bullshit!

55:12.877 --> 55:17.448
That strain, it isn't even
that strong. I've...

55:17.482 --> 55:22.653
[flatulence]

55:41.872 --> 55:43.173
[sniffing]

56:05.763 --> 56:08.132
Well, wipe his ass
and call that a shit.

56:08.165 --> 56:10.401
[laughing]

56:10.435 --> 56:14.371
Seriously, he's gonna be back
now that he sees what we've got,

56:14.405 --> 56:17.742
so you stay away
from his kooky niece.

56:17.775 --> 56:20.077
We don't want anymore
shit hitting the fan.

56:25.215 --> 56:29.720
That fat, cross-dressing
fuck is going to ruin me!

56:29.754 --> 56:32.389
- Nay, I say.
- He can't, he shan't.

56:32.423 --> 56:33.924
Shut up!

56:33.958 --> 56:35.860
[sighs]

56:36.961 --> 56:40.330
That plant was the best
I have ever tasted.

56:40.364 --> 56:42.800
It's already taken
all my customers.

56:42.833 --> 56:44.268
If he gets it
into the Amsterdam cup,

56:44.301 --> 56:45.870
he'll take my trophy
and my title,

56:45.903 --> 56:47.538
and we will be
closed within a year.

56:47.572 --> 56:51.241
And I will be the one flashing
my cock and balls for a living.

56:53.077 --> 56:54.612
Unless...

56:54.645 --> 56:56.180
- Unless... unless?
- Unless... unless!

56:56.213 --> 56:57.782
[hushing]

56:57.815 --> 57:02.252
Unless...
we do something about it.

57:04.188 --> 57:06.857
The severing dwarfs.

57:08.425 --> 57:11.061
[both] Severing dwarfs.

57:11.696 --> 57:13.898
[chuckling]

57:13.931 --> 57:15.900
What's going on?

57:15.933 --> 57:20.037
Oh, nothing.
You know, just...

57:22.306 --> 57:23.908
- [flatulence]
- relaxing.

57:23.941 --> 57:25.242
Where are you going?

57:25.275 --> 57:27.912
Just going to buy some supplies,
we're running low on papers.

57:27.945 --> 57:30.781
- You seem to be
going out a lot lately.
- Just trying to keep us afloat

57:30.815 --> 57:32.750
now that Mick's stealing
all your customers.

57:32.783 --> 57:35.085
[flatulence]

57:36.086 --> 57:37.522
Off you go, then.

57:41.391 --> 57:45.930
Something is not right.
Follow her,
see what you can find out.

57:46.664 --> 57:48.566
I will worry about Heidi.

57:57.908 --> 57:59.677
- Yo, man!
- Fuck!

57:59.710 --> 58:01.311
[both laughing]

58:02.379 --> 58:04.481
Why, why did you wanna meet
here? It's...

58:04.515 --> 58:05.650
For this.

58:05.683 --> 58:07.652
This is lover's bridge,

58:07.685 --> 58:11.021
where people from all over
the world come to declare
their love for each other.

58:11.055 --> 58:16.493
They put the padlock
onto the chain
and each keeps a key forever.

58:16.527 --> 58:20.831
The padlock can never be opened
and their love never broken.

58:20.865 --> 58:23.033
That's really romantic.

58:24.368 --> 58:27.237
Oh, what you doing?
Were you gonna...

58:27.271 --> 58:31.075
- No, no I was...
- That's so sweet, you were.

58:31.108 --> 58:37.147
Okay, close your eyes,
pout your lips.

58:40.918 --> 58:43.654
Best kiss in Amsterdam.
[giggles]

59:04.441 --> 59:11.281
Left a bit. No, no right.
Back a bit. Stop!

59:11.315 --> 59:14.484
Perfect!
Get the supplies we needed?

59:14.518 --> 59:16.587
Supply shop was closed.

59:16.621 --> 59:20.691
- It was closed?
Well, why was that?
- Plumbing problem.

59:22.026 --> 59:24.595
Plumbing problems?

59:24.629 --> 59:28.532
And it wasn't because you were
off with Mick Kali's mongrel?

59:28.565 --> 59:31.769
What? No. We don't associate
with the likes of him.

59:31.802 --> 59:36.774
Come now, princess,
no need to keep secrets.

59:40.010 --> 59:41.712
Or secret jars of money.

59:42.880 --> 59:44.414
You went in my room?

59:48.485 --> 59:49.854
What is this, then?

59:51.588 --> 59:56.126
"All the places
I wanna go to when I'm 21."

59:58.262 --> 01:00:01.198
That is going to be
hard to do without any money.

01:00:04.802 --> 01:00:09.406
Now that...
now that makes me sad.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:12.843
- I almost want to cry.
- That's my money.

01:00:12.877 --> 01:00:14.578
Yes, it is!

01:00:16.146 --> 01:00:23.220
And it can stay yours
if you do exactly as I ask.

01:00:24.488 --> 01:00:25.990
And what's that?

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:34.564
I want you to convince Mick
to meet with me.

01:00:36.667 --> 01:00:43.007
You know, like a truce
to end our feud,

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:45.609
re-kindle our friendship.

01:00:46.811 --> 01:00:48.345
And that's it?

01:00:49.814 --> 01:00:51.749
That is it.

01:00:51.782 --> 01:00:56.086
Well, you know what they say,
"If you can't beat them,
you join them".

01:00:58.723 --> 01:01:01.125
My colleague and I have been
doing some research.

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:06.096
The Green Stalk would be
the greatest weed to utilize
in creating...

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:08.899
- the ultimate high.
- Ultimate high.

01:01:08.933 --> 01:01:12.369
The Iceolator would be
a cup winner, for sure!

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:16.707
- Iceolator?
- If only we had
that missing page.

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:19.576
What's she doing here?

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:23.180
Michael, we shall return
after some further research.

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:25.082
Mon frère, MJ.

01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:27.317
Actually, I was hoping
to talk to you.

01:01:30.654 --> 01:01:33.323
My uncle wants to give you this.

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:37.661
He says he's really sorry.
He wants to put
your differences to rest.

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:41.799
You can tell your uncle,

01:01:41.832 --> 01:01:47.071
that he can shove whatever's in
that box up his tiny ass.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:49.774
One minute.

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:55.545
Mick, if you just look
at what she's bought over,

01:01:55.579 --> 01:01:57.247
it would mean a lot to me.

01:01:59.183 --> 01:02:03.620
Of all the girls in Amsterdam,
did ya have to pick her?

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:08.658
Yeah.

01:02:08.692 --> 01:02:10.594
Well, it's not
gonna work though, kid.

01:02:10.627 --> 01:02:13.330
He couldn't even show up face
to face and apologize in person,

01:02:13.363 --> 01:02:15.032
instead he sends
his little messenger.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:16.967
I was only trying to help.

01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:22.106
The fuck was that?

01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:23.941
You don't know that family, man.

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:25.810
I cant trust 'em
as far as I can throw 'em.

01:02:25.843 --> 01:02:26.877
Well, she's not Eddie!

01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:29.079
He probably wants
a share of my profits

01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:31.816
now he sees how successful I am!

01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:38.222
Look, Jack.
For the first time in three
years I'm almost above water.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:42.259
A few more days of business
and I can pay off my debts.

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:44.862
My luck changed
when you showed up.

01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:48.065
Don't let some girl get in
the way of what we've got now.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:03.513
Well, I'll be damned.

01:03:14.859 --> 01:03:16.894
It's one of my trophies.

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:23.300
[humming]

01:03:27.371 --> 01:03:29.039
[door shuts]

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:37.915
What do you two want?

01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:39.649
* It seems the lady Desiree

01:03:39.683 --> 01:03:41.685
* Requests your presence
across the way *

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:43.753
* A special night
she has in store *

01:03:43.787 --> 01:03:47.124
* Surprises, romance,
maybe more *

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.226
Oh...

01:03:51.195 --> 01:03:52.462
What?

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:54.698
Desiree has a surprise
for you across the street,

01:03:54.731 --> 01:03:57.868
get going, might get
some gash tonight, boy!

01:03:59.736 --> 01:04:02.006
- Go. I'll bag the money.
- Really?

01:04:02.039 --> 01:04:07.211
Yeah, of course,
I've got MJ with me.
Haven't I? Yes. We'll be fine.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:11.481
Okay. Bye, MJ.

01:04:14.084 --> 01:04:15.385
You're a good friend.

01:04:17.888 --> 01:04:20.457
[door opens, shuts]

01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:25.329
What you doing?

01:04:26.063 --> 01:04:28.765
[people chattering]

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:59.629
I know I can be...
overly ambitious,

01:05:00.931 --> 01:05:03.767
maybe even a bit of a cock.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.404
Look at that,
finally agreeing on something.

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:11.708
Piss off, will you?
Trying to say that I'm sorry.

01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:18.182
I know we didn't
end on the best of terms,

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:24.521
but the truth is,
when you blamed me
for that accident... that hurt.

01:05:26.723 --> 01:05:28.825
You're my best friend.

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:45.575
Um... what's all this?

01:05:46.343 --> 01:05:48.878
This is my birthday party.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.816
Desiree, I'm really sorry,
I should have...

01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:57.988
No! You didn't need
to do anything.
Just be here, celebrate with me.

01:05:58.022 --> 01:06:02.092
- Today I am 21.
- You're free.

01:06:02.126 --> 01:06:03.693
[giggles]

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:09.666
Okay, what do you want?

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:11.268
- The plant.
- What?

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:16.673
- We're taking the plant.
- Are you? You and what army?

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:19.276
[all laughing]

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:21.211
- Severin' dwarfs!
- Chop chop!

01:06:21.245 --> 01:06:23.880
[screams]

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:26.483
[dwarfs yelling]

01:06:31.188 --> 01:06:32.322
[both chuckling]

01:06:32.356 --> 01:06:34.191
And then in the morning,

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:35.759
it had grown
right out of the building, man!

01:06:35.792 --> 01:06:42.066
- No way. Unbelievable.
What luck.
- I know.

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:44.768
- And it couldn't happen
to a better guy.
- I know.

01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:46.870
- And at a better time.
- I'll say.

01:06:46.903 --> 01:06:50.440
You know I was gonna be kicked
out on the street any day, man.

01:06:50.474 --> 01:06:55.112
Now, I can finally
hang up my heels for good.

01:06:56.446 --> 01:06:57.947
Cheers.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.589
No, no, no!
No, please, not the money!

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.063
Come on, MJ.

01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:25.742
Ring, Mick.

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:27.611
[both laughing]

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:28.745
[phone ringing]

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:31.047
I gotta take this, that's me.

01:07:31.081 --> 01:07:34.050
That's me, man. That's me.

01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:37.754
Hold on a sec. Loz.

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:41.425
Mick, Mick,
they're destroying the plant
and they've taken all the money!

01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:44.094
It was just a plot
to get you out of the store!

01:07:44.128 --> 01:07:47.964
There's too many of them, Mick!
There's too many of them!

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:50.400
[dial tone]

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:55.539
- You.
- Yes, Michael.

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:58.041
How could you
do this to me again?

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:02.446
Oh, come now.
No need to be a sore loser.

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:05.149
You lied to me!

01:08:05.182 --> 01:08:07.117
That I did,

01:08:07.151 --> 01:08:12.722
and luckily your son
is as big a fool as you are.

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:18.362
- And Desiree
is as cunning as I am.
- What? Desiree?

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:22.899
Oh, yeah, we made a little
agreement, you see.

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:25.969
She would help me destroy
that beautiful plant of yours,

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:29.473
and I would set her free.

01:08:29.506 --> 01:08:33.377
I couldn't have you stealing
anymore of my customers, Mickie.

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:38.747
Or, God forbid,
beat me in the cup!

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:47.256
No!

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:49.193
There's too much!

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:52.229
- We'll take what we can!
- And the rest?

01:08:53.763 --> 01:08:58.435
- Throw it into the pool!
- What are ya...
Not in the pool!

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:03.473
Yes! Get it outta here!
Let's go!

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:07.377
Come with me.
You've made some money now.

01:09:07.411 --> 01:09:11.881
Travel together,
see the world, be free.

01:09:11.915 --> 01:09:14.751
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.319
I... [stuttering]

01:09:16.353 --> 01:09:18.755
I mean, I just met my dad.

01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:22.992
And I feel like he needs me.

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:35.439
I'll never forget you.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:41.077
Ditto. And you know,
after I've seen the world,

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:42.712
I'll know where to find you.

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:50.118
- You witch!
- Dad.

01:09:50.153 --> 01:09:52.988
You lying scum
of a bastard whore!

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:56.226
Whoa! Right, calm down,
you're drunk.

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:58.428
She tricked you, Jack!

01:09:58.462 --> 01:10:02.198
They just tried to get us
outta the shop so they could
destroy the plant, man!

01:10:02.232 --> 01:10:03.933
- What?
- What do you mean,
destroy the plant?!

01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:06.303
Oh, she know...
you know!

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:09.005
Didn't Eddie tell you
to arrange the drinks tonight?

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:11.475
- Yes, but...
- Ah-ha!

01:10:11.508 --> 01:10:14.244
She's been in on it
the whole time, man!

01:10:14.278 --> 01:10:18.848
She wanted to earn your trust
just so that Eddie
would let her leave.

01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:20.384
That can't be true, because you
wouldn't do that to me.

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:22.986
No, Jack, he said
he'd take my money, but I...

01:10:23.019 --> 01:10:27.090
- [Loz] Hello?
Could somebody please help us?
- You serious?

01:10:27.123 --> 01:10:30.694
Mick! Jack! Anyone?

01:11:07.664 --> 01:11:09.933
- You knew about this?
- No.

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:12.736
You invited me over there
to get me out the store
so you could ruin us!

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.904
- Jack...
- No!

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:17.641
You've admitted it!
You already said that
Eddie put you up to this.

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:20.377
- I didn't know he was
going to do this!
- Get out.

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:24.948
- Jack, please don't...
- Go on your stupid trip.
See the world.

01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:27.484
Please!
Don't come back!

01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:31.921
Go! Get out!

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:41.097
[door opens, shuts]

01:11:44.267 --> 01:11:45.402
Dad...

01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:50.674
What're doing?

01:11:50.707 --> 01:11:52.509
What does it
look like I'm doing?

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:57.614
I gotta pay up by tomorrow
or I'm finished.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.483
You don't need to do this,
all right?

01:11:59.516 --> 01:12:04.754
OK, there's loads of things
we can do, and I'm gonna help.

01:12:04.788 --> 01:12:07.657
That's what you said when you
showed up in the first place,

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:10.594
where's it gotten me, man?

01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:16.500
No, no, where's it gotten me?
Nowhere.

01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:19.869
You, you, this is your fault.

01:12:19.903 --> 01:12:22.372
- What, me?
- You, it's your fault!

01:12:22.406 --> 01:12:24.173
- It's not my fault.
- It's all your fault.

01:12:24.207 --> 01:12:27.343
- It's not my fault!
- It's your fault!

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:32.616
I was fine!
I was just fine.

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:37.654
Can anyone untie me?
Jack or Mick?

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.088
No!

01:12:42.392 --> 01:12:46.229
No, Mick. Heidi's the only one
who can save us now.

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:48.264
You don't have to,
please, just wait!

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:50.767
I want you outta here
by the time I get back!

01:12:54.638 --> 01:13:00.610
- You'll never see me again.
- Good.

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:09.152
[door opens, shuts]

01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:19.696
- It's okay, Jack.
- Just leave me
alone for a minute.

01:13:21.665 --> 01:13:27.236
- Mary Jane wants to
tell you that...
- Stop with that! All right?

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:28.672
Yeah.

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:32.576
I'm just trying to be
a good friend.

01:13:32.609 --> 01:13:36.580
You're not my friend!
Mick's not my dad,
and you're not my friend!

01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:43.252
- And MJ,
just your fucking hand!
- Sorry.

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:46.723
No, I'm sorry, mate.

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:49.959
No, man, no. I didn't mean that,
look, I'm just upset.

01:13:49.993 --> 01:13:53.329
- All right? I didn't...
- It's fine. You're right, look.

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:02.438
Goodbye, Jack.

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:10.514
- It's a bit awkward in'nit?
- It is, isn't it?

01:14:10.547 --> 01:14:12.015
[both sobbing]

01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:13.783
- I should probably
untie you shouldn't I?
- Yes, please.

01:14:13.817 --> 01:14:15.685
All right, I will.

01:14:40.777 --> 01:14:43.012
I love you all.

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:47.150
Suck my dick!

01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:50.820
[Roxy] Going somewhere?

01:14:54.357 --> 01:14:55.859
Roxy?

01:14:57.694 --> 01:15:00.029
It's good to see ya, Mick.

01:15:00.063 --> 01:15:03.833
I see you've taken to
wearing women's clothing,
I can't say I'm surprised.

01:15:03.867 --> 01:15:05.368
[chuckles]

01:15:07.804 --> 01:15:09.438
But you're dead.

01:15:12.275 --> 01:15:15.679
Oh, God, you're a ghost.

01:15:15.712 --> 01:15:19.215
Which means, oh, God, I'm dead!

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:22.418
I jumped, man,
I jumped and I drowned!

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:25.555
Oh, Jesus!
Now I'm a ghost too, man!

01:15:25.589 --> 01:15:27.056
We're in purgatory.

01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:30.459
Jesus, we're in purgatory
together, man!

01:15:30.493 --> 01:15:31.861
I can't feel anything.

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:36.099
I can't feel anything.
I'm so cold.

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:39.468
Get a grip on yourself.
I'm not dead.

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:43.039
What is the matter with you?

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:48.745
- You're alive?
- 'Course I'm alive, Mick.

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.381
You bloody idiot.

01:15:52.415 --> 01:15:56.620
Now where's that son of ours?
It's time we acted like parents.

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:00.824
But first, let's get fucked.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:06.129
Yeah!
I've missed you so much.

01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:08.898
- Amsterdam, baby!
- Yeah.

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:21.110
My, so this place
is still a shithole then?

01:16:21.144 --> 01:16:25.348
Look at the state...
Whoa, Jack, what's the matter?

01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:31.921
[narrator]
The day the world was waiting
for had arrived.

01:16:31.955 --> 01:16:34.457
It was the dawn of the Cup.

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:38.928
Everyone was eagerly waiting
for the competition to begin.

01:16:40.163 --> 01:16:43.566
Everyone, apart from Jack.

01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:46.836
With his dreams in tatters,

01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:52.241
it seemed the only thing he
could hope for was a miracle.

01:16:54.978 --> 01:16:57.346
[man on PA] ...report to
the Jolly Green Giant...

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:01.017
What's all the commotion?

01:17:01.818 --> 01:17:03.319
Nothing.

01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:04.988
- What's going on?
- Pix, nothing.

01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:10.727
- There's my boy!
- Jack! Your mother,
she's alive, man!

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:13.062
- It's a miracle!
- Debatable.

01:17:14.097 --> 01:17:15.799
So how's my boy doing?

01:17:15.832 --> 01:17:18.067
I was better before
you arrived to be honest, Mom.

01:17:18.101 --> 01:17:20.103
Come on, don't be like that.

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:24.708
All that time you lied to me,
you expect me to just welcome
you with open arms?

01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:29.045
Come on, Jackie, don't be
crawling up my fanny like that.

01:17:29.078 --> 01:17:32.381
[Jack groans]
How is that an appropriate thing
to say to your son?

01:17:32.415 --> 01:17:36.986
All you care about is how
short your skirt is and what guy
your bunking up with next!

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.154
It's disgusting!

01:17:38.187 --> 01:17:40.957
"Oh, I'm Roxy, the sexy star
of The Slut Puppets."

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:42.058
Who suck by the way!

01:17:42.091 --> 01:17:44.593
Oi, no,
that is totally out of order!

01:17:44.627 --> 01:17:49.398
No, it's all right, sis,
he's right. We're shit.

01:17:49.432 --> 01:17:51.067
Good shit, though.

01:17:52.836 --> 01:17:57.573
I know what I've done is wrong,
but I deserve a second chance.

01:17:57.606 --> 01:17:59.275
I shouldn't have
kept Mick from you.

01:17:59.308 --> 01:18:03.112
You missed out
on having a father,

01:18:03.146 --> 01:18:05.982
or whatever that is,
I'm sorry about that.

01:18:07.583 --> 01:18:13.656
When you left it...
you gave me the kick
in the clit I needed, you know?

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:17.260
I know I can't make up
for the shit in the past, but...

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:21.865
I wanna at least give you
a chance at a good future.

01:18:21.898 --> 01:18:23.332
You got me going now.

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:25.368
[sobbing]

01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:31.540
- I'm so proud of you.
- Me too, son.

01:18:39.482 --> 01:18:43.519
- I ruined
everything for you, Dad.
- Nah, man.

01:18:45.088 --> 01:18:49.192
- I was a loser
when you found me, Jack.
- Yeah.

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:55.331
Well, look at this place, Roxy.
Remember it, Nikki?

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:57.600
Pixie.

01:18:57.633 --> 01:19:02.806
Yeah. You came in,
tits hanging out.

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.109
[groans]

01:19:07.276 --> 01:19:10.613
Oh, yeah. Good to go.

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:24.861
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:19:29.565 --> 01:19:31.534
Oh, you have to be kidding me!

01:19:32.869 --> 01:19:34.237
No, no, no, no, no.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:38.041
[groaning]

01:19:39.542 --> 01:19:41.444
I just re-built!

01:19:41.477 --> 01:19:47.016
- I'm, I'm sorry, I...
I just fell.
- What's wrong with you people?

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:51.620
I didn't mean to, I just,
I lost a piece of paper

01:19:51.654 --> 01:19:54.958
and it had the drawing of a,
of a map on it.

01:19:54.991 --> 01:20:00.329
[sobbing]
And I lost it,
I, I lost everything.

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:14.810
But this isn't of mine, mine has
a drawing of a... of a map.

01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:19.682
Shhhh... trust me.

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:23.419
That will take you
where you need to go.

01:20:27.223 --> 01:20:29.392
But this is blank.

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:47.510
Guys, I need your help.

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:53.016
Look.

01:20:58.787 --> 01:20:59.655
[gasps]

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.690
- Spence.
- Pete.

01:21:01.724 --> 01:21:04.260
- Ice...
- [all] ...olator!

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:05.794
The ultimate high!

01:21:08.898 --> 01:21:11.200
[rock music plays]

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:15.004
- Still got this?
- Of course.

01:21:20.543 --> 01:21:22.145
I'll miss it here.

01:21:25.748 --> 01:21:27.383
Not if we can save it.

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:29.685
Desiree.

01:21:31.087 --> 01:21:33.856
You got some nerve
showing up here again, Desiree.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.024
We have to enter the cup.

01:21:35.058 --> 01:21:37.160
Shouldn't you be with
your uncle across the road?

01:21:37.193 --> 01:21:39.795
Nope, I'm smoking on the right
side of the street.

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:43.266
This fair maiden found the
missing page from our notebook.

01:21:43.299 --> 01:21:45.734
Mick, I need all
the Green Stalk you have.

01:21:47.336 --> 01:21:49.438
- There's none left.
- It's ruined.

01:21:49.472 --> 01:21:52.208
It's not ruined, it's wet.

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:54.277
And that's exactly
how we want it.

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:57.546
Kinky little minx
knows our lyrics.

01:22:00.216 --> 01:22:02.285
[announcer]
Ladies and Gentlemen,

01:22:02.318 --> 01:22:08.691
please welcome into the arena
the teams for this year's
Amsterdam Cup!

01:22:08.724 --> 01:22:09.758
[all cheering]

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:13.296
The Sin-Derellaz!

01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:18.701
Last year's runner up,
the all girl group of power
has landed in the tower.

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:29.445
The Gingerbread Men!

01:22:32.181 --> 01:22:36.152
These five balls of fire are
always trying to get higher!

01:22:36.185 --> 01:22:39.688
Watch out when
these guys are about.

01:22:46.195 --> 01:22:49.232
The Pied Pipers!

01:22:55.004 --> 01:22:58.941
One foot in the grave,
but they still love to rave.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:02.845
And like the fine wine,
they get better with time.

01:23:04.547 --> 01:23:11.154
And finally,
the defending champions,
the Jolly Green Giants!

01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:12.921
[loud cheer]

01:23:12.955 --> 01:23:18.294
Eddie and his unstoppable team
are aiming for their
seventh consecutive win!

01:23:21.597 --> 01:23:27.603
Let's get ready to roll!

01:23:27.636 --> 01:23:31.074
- Ready to launch, captain.
- The process takes longer
than we have,

01:23:31.107 --> 01:23:33.409
but the more people that help,
the faster we can...

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:35.444
I'll help.
You guys need Loz on your team.

01:23:35.478 --> 01:23:36.845
[Mick]
But we still have a problem.

01:23:36.879 --> 01:23:39.848
- We don't have
the entrance fee money.
- That's not true.

01:23:39.882 --> 01:23:42.418
Desiree you can't,
that's your escape money.

01:23:42.451 --> 01:23:44.887
If it wasn't for my uncle,
I wouldn't need it.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:48.391
And nothing would make me
happier than the look
on his face when you win.

01:23:48.424 --> 01:23:51.327
I'm so sorry for all that stuff
I said to you earlier.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.728
You couldn't have known
that your uncle...

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:57.900
Hush, hush, Mickie.
Let's take that fucker down.

01:23:57.933 --> 01:24:00.669
Hey, guys, guys: snail.

01:24:01.537 --> 01:24:04.973
Hey, guys: octopus. Big octopus.

01:24:05.007 --> 01:24:07.243
[announcer]
We have a surprise, late entry.

01:24:07.276 --> 01:24:12.215
Please welcome into the arena,
Kalifornia Dreamin'.

01:24:23.926 --> 01:24:26.129
What the fuck is he doing here?

01:24:29.598 --> 01:24:31.234
[hissing]

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:38.141
[announcer]
Let's give a warm welcome
to the High Chancellor of Weed,

01:24:38.174 --> 01:24:44.012
and our judge extraordinaire,
Sir Howard Marks!

01:24:49.852 --> 01:24:54.757
Welcome to
the only place in the world

01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:59.462
where the grass
is always greener:

01:24:59.495 --> 01:25:02.030
Amsterdam!

01:25:02.064 --> 01:25:04.066
[crowd cheering]

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:18.147
There will be several rounds
of competition,

01:25:18.181 --> 01:25:23.486
with points awarded to the
winning team in each category.

01:25:23.519 --> 01:25:28.157
First up,
Creative Joint Rolling!

01:25:28.191 --> 01:25:29.525
[cheering]

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:34.963
- Loz, you're up.
- Um... no.

01:25:35.998 --> 01:25:38.701
- What? Why?
- Only friends help each other,

01:25:38.734 --> 01:25:42.137
and he made it quite clear
I haven't got any of those.

01:25:50.913 --> 01:25:52.448
I'm really sorry.

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:56.552
I was upset and the fact is,

01:25:56.585 --> 01:26:01.557
when I arrived, no one was
as nice to me as you were.

01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:06.695
I mean, you're not just my
friend, you're my best friend.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:13.402
- And I love MJ.
- Fuck off with the fairytale
bullshit, you lot.

01:26:13.436 --> 01:26:16.305
Jesus Christ, I tell you what,
you get your arse up there.

01:26:16.339 --> 01:26:21.377
Me, you, that weird finger
of yours, play a bit
of hide and seek later.

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:27.250
[chuckles]
Okay.

01:26:27.283 --> 01:26:29.952
Go on, Loz, we fucking love you!

01:26:29.985 --> 01:26:32.187
- Sorry, sorry,
I got carried away.
- That's good.

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:38.261
On your Howard Marks...
get set...

01:26:39.094 --> 01:26:40.396
roll!

01:26:40.429 --> 01:26:42.498
[cheering]

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:48.504
Are we really supposed
to add this much ice?

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:52.408
The goal is to completely
separate the THC from the weed.

01:26:52.441 --> 01:26:54.943
We are not making
a regular high.

01:26:54.977 --> 01:26:58.414
We are making,
the ultimate high.

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:02.651
Iceolator.

01:27:02.685 --> 01:27:05.588
Inhale, bitches.

01:27:08.324 --> 01:27:09.825
What the fuck is he making, man?

01:27:09.858 --> 01:27:13.796
It's all right.
Trust him. He's got this.

01:27:19.302 --> 01:27:24.607
- Very nice. Very nice.
Let's get more.
- Yeah.

01:27:30.112 --> 01:27:32.648
[announcer]
This round just gets
crazier every year.

01:27:32.681 --> 01:27:36.885
Looks what's being created
using just marijuana
rolling papers.

01:27:40.489 --> 01:27:44.259
Okay, contestants! Stop rolling.

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:48.130
Settle down. Settle down.

01:27:49.231 --> 01:27:52.768
They look amazing.
Really stunning.

01:27:52.801 --> 01:27:55.471
But it's not about origami.

01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:59.207
I wonder how well they smoke.

01:28:02.378 --> 01:28:05.080
- Ready.
- Here we go.

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:09.217
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
don't we need something
to strain the THC?

01:28:09.251 --> 01:28:12.988
Oh. You are right.

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:17.826
Michael must have
a fishing net or something.

01:28:27.202 --> 01:28:29.805
[crowd whispering]

01:28:29.838 --> 01:28:34.209
Do I suck... or do I blow?

01:28:34.242 --> 01:28:36.779
[crowd laughing]

01:28:36.812 --> 01:28:39.948
It's not that funny.
It's not that funny.

01:28:39.982 --> 01:28:41.750
Are you sure these will work?

01:28:43.519 --> 01:28:46.955
- They're perfect.
- We are good to go.

01:28:48.223 --> 01:28:49.925
[mechanical whirring]

01:28:49.958 --> 01:28:52.160
[power shuts down]

01:28:53.862 --> 01:28:55.263
Maybe not.

01:28:57.032 --> 01:29:02.371
[announcer]
The cup's first ever, official
volcano spliff. Kaboom!

01:29:02.405 --> 01:29:05.441
[crowd cheering]

01:29:05.474 --> 01:29:07.209
Fuck the volcano.

01:29:10.379 --> 01:29:14.216
[announcer]
Whoa, you could power the whole
Netherlands with that windmill.

01:29:14.249 --> 01:29:16.151
This is just crazy.

01:29:20.389 --> 01:29:23.291
Jack said they would
pull the plug on Mick soon.

01:29:23.325 --> 01:29:25.293
Looks like it is game over.

01:29:25.327 --> 01:29:30.332
Without electric to stir
the weed and ice together
there will be no Iceolator.

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:35.370
Fuck it.

01:29:42.778 --> 01:29:46.915
Jolly Green Giant
have won this fucking round.

01:29:51.019 --> 01:29:55.891
- This was a bad idea.
- Nah, come on, baby.

01:29:55.924 --> 01:30:00.228
- You never went
down on me this quick.
- Okay.

01:30:00.262 --> 01:30:01.363
[Howard]
Round two.

01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:05.501
- Wait, wait, wait.
- The Longest Joint.

01:30:05.534 --> 01:30:07.135
[indistinct chatter]

01:30:07.169 --> 01:30:09.171
[rock music plays]

01:30:14.843 --> 01:30:16.512
[announcer]
Pied Pipers!

01:30:16.545 --> 01:30:18.681
Get in here,
I'm not doing this alone.

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:26.088
The Smuggle Juggle.

01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:51.547
- Well, if we must.
- For the good of the team.

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:55.417
[announcer]
Yee-ha! The Giants
are taking an early lead.

01:31:14.136 --> 01:31:17.139
The Giants extend their lead.

01:31:26.081 --> 01:31:28.216
The Bong Balance.

01:31:30.653 --> 01:31:32.287
Come on, Roxy!

01:31:37.793 --> 01:31:41.396
[announcer]
Whoa! The legendary singer,
Roxy from The Slut Puppets,

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:44.499
has bagged Kalifornia Dreamin's
first win.

01:31:51.907 --> 01:31:55.243
Spliff Roulette! Kaboom!

01:32:05.788 --> 01:32:07.155
[announcer]
Gingers!

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:26.374
[Spence] Faster!

01:32:30.212 --> 01:32:32.314
Paper Planes.

01:32:38.687 --> 01:32:40.255
Yeah!

01:32:42.357 --> 01:32:44.693
Scratch and Sniff.

01:32:49.998 --> 01:32:52.801
Bet you can't even guess
if it's weed or hash.

01:32:52.835 --> 01:32:54.269
[laughing]

01:32:58.506 --> 01:33:01.443
The old man is crazy!
[chuckles]

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:07.916
[buzzer sounds]

01:33:09.818 --> 01:33:14.156
Three people guessed the strain.

01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:20.495
One person guessed
the weight and the strain.

01:33:20.528 --> 01:33:27.002
But this
was profanity personified.

01:33:27.035 --> 01:33:32.374
One person guessed the weight,

01:33:32.407 --> 01:33:38.013
the strain, and the soil
in which it was grown.

01:33:38.046 --> 01:33:43.418
And the winner is,
Kalifornia Dreamin'!

01:33:47.022 --> 01:33:51.359
[announcer]
Unbelievable! Mick Kali has
taken Kalifornia Dreamin'

01:33:51.393 --> 01:33:55.864
into a head to head final
with the Jolly Green Giants!

01:33:55.898 --> 01:33:59.267
Okay, contestants.

01:33:59.301 --> 01:34:06.341
It's time I toke on your
homegrown smoke. Come on!

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:08.210
[crowd cheers]

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.899
Where is she?

01:34:35.971 --> 01:34:37.672
I've waited all year for this.

01:34:37.706 --> 01:34:40.709
It's well worth the wait,
Mr. Marks.

01:34:43.912 --> 01:34:46.982
[crowd gasps]

01:34:51.653 --> 01:34:54.656
Smells like Christmas
come early this year.

01:34:55.724 --> 01:34:57.826
[exclaims]

01:34:59.461 --> 01:35:01.864
- [woman] Is it tight?
- [man] Nice and tight.

01:35:01.897 --> 01:35:03.698
Here we go.
Bit more, bit more...

01:35:03.732 --> 01:35:05.968
[all mumbling]

01:35:10.839 --> 01:35:13.408
[crowd cheers]

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:15.443
[announcer]
Our reigning champion, Eddie,

01:35:15.477 --> 01:35:17.712
sure looks happy
with his entry this year.

01:35:17.746 --> 01:35:21.283
Let's see what the
Ganja Godfather has to say.

01:35:21.316 --> 01:35:23.418
[bubbling and burning]

01:35:30.759 --> 01:35:35.864
Jesus...
this is fucking amazing!

01:35:35.898 --> 01:35:38.400
This has gotta be a winner.

01:35:45.841 --> 01:35:49.044
Wankers, have some'a that.

01:35:49.077 --> 01:35:50.879
May I see your entry, Mick?

01:35:53.715 --> 01:35:55.517
Uh...

01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:59.087
No.

01:35:59.121 --> 01:36:01.857
I'm sorry, boys,
but without any weed,

01:36:01.890 --> 01:36:03.425
I've gotta disqualify you.

01:36:05.227 --> 01:36:07.629
And announce Jolly Green Giant...

01:36:07.662 --> 01:36:10.198
Wait! This is our entry.

01:36:12.801 --> 01:36:15.770
Sneaky little whore!

01:36:15.804 --> 01:36:19.374
This is
Kalifornia Dreamin's entry.

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:21.944
Is that the...

01:36:21.977 --> 01:36:26.214
My God. It's...

01:36:26.248 --> 01:36:29.885
- The Iceolator?
- Yes, Howard, The Iceolator.

01:36:31.653 --> 01:36:34.857
You little bitch.

01:36:36.258 --> 01:36:37.792
Get to your room.

01:36:37.826 --> 01:36:39.527
Seem to be forgetting I'm 21,

01:36:39.561 --> 01:36:41.496
you can't tell me
what to do anymore.

01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:46.001
- She's a keeper, man.
- She really is.

01:36:46.034 --> 01:36:48.403
Come on load it up,
I... I have to taste it.

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:52.975
Come on, man,
my lungs are waiting.

01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:56.945
Thank you.

01:36:58.346 --> 01:36:59.781
[lighter flicks]

01:37:02.951 --> 01:37:04.819
[inhales]

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:14.762
[coughs]

01:37:14.796 --> 01:37:16.164
[giggles]

01:37:16.198 --> 01:37:18.366
[coughing]

01:37:29.577 --> 01:37:32.080
- There's no pulse.
- What?

01:37:32.114 --> 01:37:33.448
[crowd gasps]

01:37:33.481 --> 01:37:34.917
Oh, my God!

01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:51.333
[all cheering]

01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:03.979
I haven't had hash like this
since the 1970s.

01:38:04.012 --> 01:38:09.817
When I was in Nepal and even
that naughty Nepalese beauty,

01:38:09.851 --> 01:38:13.855
didn't have the kick that this
cheeky little fucker's got.

01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:15.290
[Desiree chuckles]

01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:23.165
And the winner
of the Amsterdam Cup,

01:38:24.166 --> 01:38:28.036
is Kalifornia Dreamin'!

01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:29.371
[cheering]

01:38:29.404 --> 01:38:31.639
No! No!

01:38:49.124 --> 01:38:53.761
[narrator] Everything that
young Jack had wished for
had become a reality.

01:38:53.795 --> 01:38:59.301
And although Jack was sure
the story was nearing its end,
he didn't realize...

01:38:59.334 --> 01:39:03.371
- Cease you intrepid
brain beast!
- That his journey was only j...

01:39:03.405 --> 01:39:07.009
- Shut up! Sorry.
- His Journey was only just...

01:39:07.042 --> 01:39:11.246
- Wait a
minute, I heard that as well.
- You did?

01:39:11.279 --> 01:39:13.681
- We all did.
- Was only just...

01:39:17.219 --> 01:39:18.553
Beginning.

01:39:19.721 --> 01:39:21.523
You're the guy
that gave me the seed.

01:39:21.556 --> 01:39:24.326
You gave me the plans
for the Iceolator.

01:39:24.359 --> 01:39:25.960
You're the voice inside my head.

01:39:27.162 --> 01:39:28.496
Gordon?

01:39:28.530 --> 01:39:30.498
- The Messiah.
- I think that's him.

01:39:30.532 --> 01:39:35.403
Gordon the Great,
is it really you?

01:39:38.473 --> 01:39:41.209
- I thought you were...
- Yeah, dead? No, I'm not dead.

01:39:41.243 --> 01:39:46.748
It's good to see you again,
Mick, or at least
it's good to hear you.

01:39:46.781 --> 01:39:50.652
Aye, I was blinded
in the accident,

01:39:50.685 --> 01:39:55.357
but I've had plenty of time
to work out how to get
back at Eddie.

01:39:55.390 --> 01:40:01.329
And with Jack's help,
the evil giant
has finally fallen.

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:11.506
- Is that my lighter?
- I think it belongs
to someone else now.

01:40:15.477 --> 01:40:17.011
Thanks, Jack.

01:40:21.015 --> 01:40:24.252
That was a touch of genius
flushing that seed down
the toilet.

01:40:24.286 --> 01:40:27.922
- Turns out piss
was the ingredient...
- [both] Piss!

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:30.792
That I didn't think of to add
to the germination process.

01:40:30.825 --> 01:40:33.361
Well, it certainly made
the plant grow big, eh?

01:40:33.395 --> 01:40:34.896
You're my hero.

01:40:34.929 --> 01:40:36.431
I love you.

01:40:36.464 --> 01:40:39.467
And there is plenty more magic
where that came from.

01:40:39.501 --> 01:40:41.869
[all cheering]

01:40:41.903 --> 01:40:44.306
We're gonna make millions, man!

01:40:44.339 --> 01:40:48.843
Gordon, would you consider
coming into business
with me and Loz?

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:51.846
- I don't mind a third.
- How 'bout, a forth?

01:40:51.879 --> 01:40:53.481
- What?
- Roxy...

01:40:53.515 --> 01:40:56.784
Would you consider taking
a break from touring, darling?

01:40:57.752 --> 01:41:01.323
Suppose I could do
with a beach holiday.

01:41:02.590 --> 01:41:07.995
Oi! Oi, oi, oi. Slut Puppets?

01:41:08.029 --> 01:41:12.467
I've got a slutty puppet
right here. How about that?

01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:17.605
Now, we're all gonna have
to work together to cultivate
all these plants.

01:41:17.639 --> 01:41:20.475
Of course, but this time
we have to do it right!

01:41:20.508 --> 01:41:24.746
We cannot risk wrecking
the shop. Gordon, how many...

01:41:29.451 --> 01:41:30.818
He's got a habit of doing that.

01:41:30.852 --> 01:41:34.222
- Uh-huh.
- [toilet flushing]

01:41:41.062 --> 01:41:44.932
Gordon, what did you do
with all those seeds, man?

01:41:47.235 --> 01:41:49.171
You're gonna need a bigger shop!

01:41:49.204 --> 01:41:51.639
[chortling]

01:41:51.673 --> 01:41:53.541
[rock music playing]

01:41:54.976 --> 01:41:56.244
Shit!

01:42:00.982 --> 01:42:02.984
[choking]

01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:07.222
[laughing]

01:42:14.196 --> 01:42:16.231
- [man] Action.
- Are you sure this will...

01:42:16.264 --> 01:42:17.932
[laughing]

01:42:18.933 --> 01:42:21.836
- [man] Action.
- Are you sure... shit.

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:28.276
- [man] Action.
- Are you sure these will work?

01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:30.212
[laughing]

01:42:32.314 --> 01:42:33.448
Come on.

01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:35.450
[coughing]

01:42:39.086 --> 01:42:40.622
What are you doing?

01:42:40.655 --> 01:42:41.923
[gags]

01:42:41.956 --> 01:42:44.226
[laughing]

01:42:51.499 --> 01:42:53.901
[laughing]

01:42:59.541 --> 01:43:02.377
[rock music continues]

01:43:19.327 --> 01:43:23.998
Round eight! The Long...
Sorry, I looked in
the fucking camera.

01:43:24.031 --> 01:43:25.400
[laughing]

01:43:27.969 --> 01:43:32.039
Did you try and touch me on the
tour bus? No, doesn't matter.
Don't worry about it.

01:43:32.073 --> 01:43:33.441
Yeah.

01:43:34.576 --> 01:43:37.712
Looks like Christmas
came early this year.

01:43:37.745 --> 01:43:40.615
- Fucking smells like it
as well.
- [woman] And cut.

01:43:43.751 --> 01:43:46.120
Get rid of her
with anything that you say.

01:43:46.153 --> 01:43:49.391
- Done!
- Thank you!

01:43:49.424 --> 01:43:54.929
[Mick] ...that he can shove
what's ever in this box
up his tiny ass.

01:43:57.131 --> 01:43:59.367
Dance, Lennox, dance.

01:44:00.935 --> 01:44:06.173
Mick, has someone done
a little poo in your shop?

01:44:06.207 --> 01:44:08.276
Looks like I am
surfin' on poo, huh?

01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:10.945
[rock music continues]

01:45:05.667 --> 01:45:09.404
Iceolator...
I'll see you later.

01:45:09.437 --> 01:45:10.972
