WEBVTT

01:49.484 --> 01:50.652
Betty.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.162
What are you doing?

02:01.162 --> 02:05.333
I don't want you to ever see him again.
You can't have him.

02:05.333 --> 02:08.837
It's been over for a long time.

02:08.837 --> 02:12.757
Okay, I'm not seeing him.
I don't want him.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.384
Well, don't see him again.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.303
I'm telling you.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.514
I won't.

02:23.434 --> 02:29.899
Well, I think under the circumstances
that I should just bring Alisa home

02:29.899 --> 02:32.193
and drop her off after Bible school.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.444
No.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.489
No, I don't wanna see you anymore.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.618
Just keep Alisa.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.621
Take her to the movie.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.584
Because I don't wanna look at you again.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.838
You can bring her home tomorrow.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.007
Sure.

02:54.465 --> 02:56.843
Alisa's suit is on the washer.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.641
I'll go get a towel
from the bathroom to...

03:05.268 --> 03:06.686
to wrap it in.

03:33.087 --> 03:34.505
Thank you.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.134
Don't forget Alisa's peppermints.

03:40.553 --> 03:44.140
That's okay.
I'm sure that we have peppermints at home

03:44.140 --> 03:46.559
- that I could give her.
- She likes ours.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.696
I'll give you these.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.255
Betty.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.761
I am so sorry.

04:28.267 --> 04:29.185
Betty.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.104
You can't have him.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.064
Betty.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.649
You can't have him.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.151
I'm gonna have another baby.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.611
You can't have him. You can't have him!

04:38.611 --> 04:40.697
- You can't have him!
- Betty! What are you doing?

04:46.911 --> 04:47.996
What are you doing?

04:47.996 --> 04:50.331
I've gotta kill you.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.746
Target.

07:22.525 --> 07:23.776
I don't want him!

07:23.776 --> 07:25.027
Don't want him!

07:33.286 --> 07:35.204
Sorry. I'm sorry.

09:27.817 --> 09:31.279
No. No. No.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.489
Please, please, please, please, please.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.446
Nothing's changed.

10:23.372 --> 10:24.582
Candy!

10:24.582 --> 10:26.083
Oh, Barbara.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.711
I went to Betty's
and we just got to talkin'

10:28.711 --> 10:30.755
and I looked at my watch
and thought I had enough time

10:30.755 --> 10:34.091
to go to Target to get Father's Day cards,
so I drove all the way to Plano.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.509
But when I got to the parking lot,

10:35.509 --> 10:37.470
I realized my watch had stopped,
and so I was late.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.055
I didn't even go in. I'm so upset.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.723
I wanted to see the kids' puppet show.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.600
And Jenny was just asking about you.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.062
Well, I'm just gonna have to
make it up to them.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.897
- Candy, where have you been?
- I'm so upset.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.983
I went to Betty's and,
well, we just got to talkin'

10:50.983 --> 10:53.402
and I thought I had enough time
to go get Father's Day cards

10:53.402 --> 10:54.820
at Target. But when I got there,

10:54.820 --> 10:57.573
I realized my watch had stopped
and that I was late.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.284
I had to get Alisa's swimsuit
from Betty's,

11:00.284 --> 11:02.953
or I wouldn't have been late.
My watch stopped.

11:02.953 --> 11:06.040
We're taking Alisa with us tonight
to see "The Empire Strikes Back."

11:06.040 --> 11:08.000
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.877
Well, that reminds me,
I have to go check on the kids.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.420
- Alright.
- Bye.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.145
Hi, Mom!

11:28.145 --> 11:29.647
Hi, Mom.

11:48.749 --> 11:53.045
Mom, I like this one.
"Hats off for a wonderful Father's Day."

11:53.045 --> 11:54.755
That sounds great, honey.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.507
"To wish you a happy Father's Day,

11:56.507 --> 11:59.218
"and then to tell you, too,
there's always lots of love

11:59.218 --> 12:01.011
and pride in every thought of you."

12:02.304 --> 12:03.472
Great.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.979
- Come on, come on! Let's go!
- Wait!

12:17.695 --> 12:20.030
- Come on, Ms. Candy!
- Come on, Mommy!

12:39.967 --> 12:44.263
Girls, can you get your suits on?
We don't wanna be late for Alisa's lesson.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.902
- Hello?
-<i>Pat, hi.</i>

12:57.902 --> 12:59.737
We just got back from Bible school.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.364
I need you to make sure
you get enough money at the bank

13:02.364 --> 13:04.742
because Alisa is going
to the movies with us.

13:05.326 --> 13:08.287
- You checked with Betty?
-<i>I went to Betty's</i>

13:08.287 --> 13:09.997
to get Alisa's suit,

13:09.997 --> 13:12.666
but we just got to talkin'
and I lost track of time.

13:12.666 --> 13:15.336
And then, I got to the Target,

13:15.336 --> 13:17.296
<i>and I noticed my watch stopped.
And so, I just--</i>

13:17.296 --> 13:18.923
<i>I missed the whole Bible school program.</i>

13:21.342 --> 13:23.844
So, we'll just meet you
at the parking lot at 15 to 5!

13:26.680 --> 13:30.351
Somebody's here, honey,
so we'll meet you there.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.269
<i>- Okay!</i>
- Okay.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.022
Bye.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.948
- Hey!
- Hi. I'm so sorry.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.407
The day just got away from me.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.409
No worries.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.414
Can I grab it?

13:53.040 --> 13:54.124
What?

13:54.124 --> 13:56.502
- The card table.
- Oh, yes! Yes, of course.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.170
I swear, I don't know where my head is at.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.756
I got so busy
that I even missed the puppet show.

14:02.591 --> 14:03.551
What's wrong?

14:05.135 --> 14:07.721
Nothing. Nothin'. I'm just, you know,

14:07.721 --> 14:10.099
going in too many different
directions at once is all.

14:12.768 --> 14:13.852
It's here.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.355
Thanks for the card table!

14:18.274 --> 14:20.359
- Talk to you later, baby.
- Bye!

14:21.860 --> 14:23.737
<i>Welcome to Dallas International Airport...</i>

16:27.444 --> 16:30.364
Directory assistance, please,
in Wylie, Texas.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.037
- Hello.
-<i>Richard, hi. This is Allan Gore.</i>

16:37.037 --> 16:40.165
- Hey, Allan.
- I'm sorry to bother you.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.792
I'm out of town

16:41.792 --> 16:44.795
and I've been trying to
catch Betty all day.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.673
I think the phones must be
out of order or something.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.217
But would you mind
knocking on the door over there

16:50.217 --> 16:51.802
just to make sure she's home?

16:52.761 --> 16:54.763
<i>Sure I can run over.</i>

16:54.763 --> 16:56.932
Yeah. Hold on a minute.
I'll go check.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.101
<i>Okay, great.
Thank you so much.</i>

17:27.379 --> 17:29.548
<i>No answer, Allan. She must be out.</i>

17:29.548 --> 17:31.300
Okay.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.802
- Thank you for checking.
-<i>No problem.</i>

17:40.684 --> 17:43.061
I really like your mom's lasagna.

17:43.061 --> 17:44.688
Thanks! I'll tell her.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.401
- Remember that cute turtle I made?
- Yeah.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.903
- Out of pipe cleaners?
- Yeah.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.325
<i>Hello?</i>

17:56.325 --> 17:57.659
<i>Candy, this is Allan.</i>

17:59.411 --> 18:00.871
Have you seen Betty?

18:02.873 --> 18:04.583
Allan!

18:04.583 --> 18:07.628
- Hi, where are ya?
-<i>I'm in Minnesota on a business trip</i>

18:07.628 --> 18:09.546
<i>but I've been trying to
get ahold of Betty all day</i>

18:09.546 --> 18:11.632
and she's not answering.

18:11.632 --> 18:15.010
And I thought maybe
you talked to her today.

18:15.010 --> 18:18.388
Yes, I saw her this morning when
I went to get Alisa's swimsuit.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.766
<i>Do you happen to know
if she had any plans?</i>

18:21.475 --> 18:22.976
No.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.686
No, but I still have Alisa

18:24.686 --> 18:27.064
'cause there was a change of plans
this morning.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.900
Jenny wanted Alisa to stay over
another night

18:29.900 --> 18:32.402
so they could go to the movies.

18:32.402 --> 18:35.030
Did she seem alright to you?

18:35.030 --> 18:36.532
<i>Yeah! Yeah, she was fine.</i>

18:37.533 --> 18:40.244
You know, I'd be happy to go to the house
and check on them for you.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.121
No, that's okay.
I'll call the neighbors again.

18:43.121 --> 18:44.081
<i>Okay.</i>

18:44.081 --> 18:46.542
Okay, well, just let me know
if there's anything I can do.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.127
-<i>Okay. Thank you. Bye.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.548
What's going on?

18:53.215 --> 18:54.466
Allan's out of town.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.386
He can't get ahold of Betty,
so he's a bit worried.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.270
I'm sure she's okay.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.148
She could be out with friends.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.238
I'm gonna go call her again,
if you'll excuse me.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.381
<i>Richard, I'm really sorry about this.</i>

19:34.381 --> 19:37.384
Could you run out back
and look in the garage

19:37.384 --> 19:39.761
<i>to see if her car is there?</i>

19:39.761 --> 19:41.972
-<i>Yeah. Yeah, just a sec.</i>
-<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

19:52.482 --> 19:54.943
<i>She never leaves that garage door open.</i>

19:55.360 --> 20:01.533
Can you please go back over there,
check all the doors and the garage again

20:01.533 --> 20:05.370
and I want you to get in the house
any way that you can.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.956
- Allan just called.
- Yeah, I guess he's calling everybody.

20:07.956 --> 20:11.168
- Yeah, he called me, too.
- He sounded pretty upset.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.253
Said we should get in the house
any way we can.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.049
Got my realtor keys.
We can try 'em on all the doors.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.067
Oh shit. Hey!

20:35.067 --> 20:36.818
- Yeah?
- It's not locked.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.071
What? Lester!

20:46.912 --> 20:48.246
Betty?

20:49.206 --> 20:52.459
Betty?

21:04.388 --> 21:05.847
Betty?

21:06.765 --> 21:08.433
Oh, my God.

21:11.728 --> 21:14.314
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

21:16.817 --> 21:17.943
Hello?

21:26.118 --> 21:27.494
There's nothing here.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.590
The baby.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.552
- Hey! Hey!
- Let's...

21:43.552 --> 21:45.345
- let's get her outta here.
- It's okay. Yes.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.431
I'll take her to my house.

21:50.767 --> 21:54.312
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

21:54.312 --> 21:58.692
It's okay. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

22:00.902 --> 22:02.487
It's okay.

22:30.098 --> 22:31.641
Oh God!

22:33.143 --> 22:34.352
Don't go in there.

22:35.687 --> 22:36.897
She's dead.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.899
- What? What!
- She's dead.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.076
What.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.548
- Hello?
- This is Allan.

23:04.466 --> 23:07.260
<i>Oh God.
I have to make a decision.</i>

23:07.260 --> 23:09.513
What? What decision? What's wrong?

23:09.513 --> 23:10.889
-<i>I don't know--</i>
-<i>It's okay.</i>

23:12.057 --> 23:14.643
Allan? Yeah, it's Jerry.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.979
- What did you find?
-<i>Oh, gosh, it's not good, Allan.</i>

23:19.731 --> 23:21.441
<i>The little one's okay.</i>

23:21.441 --> 23:23.443
- The baby?
-<i>Yeah, she's okay.</i>

23:24.986 --> 23:26.863
What about Betty?

23:28.156 --> 23:31.076
- What about Betty?
-<i>I'm so sorry, Allan.</i>

23:35.914 --> 23:37.749
What? What happened?

23:37.749 --> 23:40.127
I don't know for sure, but it-- Oh God.

23:40.127 --> 23:42.379
It looks like she's been shot.

23:45.423 --> 23:47.008
I'm so sorry, Allan.

23:47.008 --> 23:49.511
I wish there was a better way to tell you.
I do.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.197
Stop. Stop.

24:09.197 --> 24:11.700
- You kidding me?
- Hello?

24:12.159 --> 24:13.243
<i>Candy,</i>

24:14.244 --> 24:16.788
<i>I have some bad news.</i>

24:17.455 --> 24:18.832
<i>Betty's dead.</i>

24:20.625 --> 24:21.793
What?

24:24.462 --> 24:26.381
What happened?

24:27.632 --> 24:30.510
<i>It looks like she's been shot, apparently.</i>

24:30.510 --> 24:32.512
<i>The neighbors found her.</i>

24:33.763 --> 24:35.182
Oh, my God.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.644
What about Bethany?

24:39.644 --> 24:41.646
We don't even own a gun.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.319
I don't even own a gun.

24:49.362 --> 24:51.281
I don't know what to say.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.451
<i>Could you please keep Alisa for a while</i>

24:54.451 --> 24:57.454
<i>and don't tell her what happened?
I wanna tell her.</i>

25:01.917 --> 25:03.793
Are you gonna be okay?

25:07.380 --> 25:08.548
Yeah.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.051
Thanks. I've gotta go.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.152
This way, Chief.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.678
Look there.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.770
Looks like one of them cult deals.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.690
Call the sheriff.

26:49.774 --> 26:53.278
We gotta have backup.
Then call Collin County.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.739
In fact, call everybody.

26:56.364 --> 26:59.743
Whoever did this could be crazy enough
to still be in the neighborhood.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.597
This is Chief Abbott.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.682
This is Allan Gore.

27:22.682 --> 27:26.186
<i>Mr. Gore.
I'm Chief Abbott of the Wylie PD.</i>

27:27.145 --> 27:29.981
<i>Can you tell me what you know
about what happened here?</i>

27:31.816 --> 27:34.402
I understand that Betty's been shot.

27:35.653 --> 27:37.572
That's correct.

27:38.823 --> 27:42.744
<i>I've been trying to reach her all day.</i>

27:42.744 --> 27:47.040
I left for Saint Paul on business at about

27:48.124 --> 27:52.670
4:30. I tried to call her before I left.
She didn't answer.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.925
I kept trying her

27:58.343 --> 28:02.263
right up until the point
that they told me.

28:02.263 --> 28:05.475
I understand.
And do you know anybody else

28:05.475 --> 28:08.144
that could have been
around the house today?

28:08.144 --> 28:11.231
<i>Well, Candy Montgomery.
She's a friend of ours.</i>

28:11.231 --> 28:16.111
She said she came by
to pick up a swimsuit this morning.

28:32.836 --> 28:33.962
Serious?

28:34.504 --> 28:37.257
The goal to contaminate
as much evidence as possible?

28:38.550 --> 28:40.343
Start with the utility room.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.682
Then the bathroom.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.851
It's covered in blood.

29:25.638 --> 29:26.806
Hello?

29:26.806 --> 29:28.266
<i>It's Allan.</i>

29:28.266 --> 29:31.769
My flight doesn't land
till about 10:00 or so.

29:31.769 --> 29:35.940
I'm going to go home first.
Can you keep Alisa till 3:00 or so?

29:35.940 --> 29:37.442
Of course.

29:38.234 --> 29:41.988
-<i>And she still doesn't know?</i>
- No. No, we've...

29:41.988 --> 29:45.033
we've kept her away from
the radio or anything like that.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.159
Okay.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.829
I talked to the police last night

29:49.829 --> 29:53.333
and I mentioned you were over there,
so they'll probably be calling you.

29:54.542 --> 29:58.129
- That's fine.
-<i>Okay. I'll call you later. Bye.</i>

29:58.129 --> 29:59.339
Okay.

30:05.803 --> 30:07.180
- Hello?
-<i>Have you heard?</i>

30:07.180 --> 30:09.182
Betty Gore's been shot.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.017
She's dead!

30:11.017 --> 30:13.645
Yes, we heard. Yes.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.772
<i>It's all over the news.</i>

30:15.772 --> 30:19.567
Honey, I have Alisa with us.
I should get off.

30:19.567 --> 30:21.653
Listen, when I get all these relations
out of my house,

30:21.653 --> 30:23.780
I'm gonna come over,
and we're gonna drink a pot of coffee

30:23.780 --> 30:25.573
- and talk.
- That is just what I need.

30:25.573 --> 30:27.367
Thank you, honey.
I'll ring if I hear more.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.744
Jesus.

30:30.662 --> 30:31.704
Hello?

30:31.704 --> 30:34.707
It's me, Jo Ann. You heard Betty's dead?

30:34.707 --> 30:38.336
We heard last night, yeah.
It's so awful.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.629
<i>The police just left.</i>

30:39.629 --> 30:41.756
They say she was murdered with an axe.

30:43.341 --> 30:45.260
- An axe?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

30:46.135 --> 30:48.304
<i>Must have been some very sick person.</i>

30:54.519 --> 30:55.979
It looks like from the pinky finger.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.188
Probably the victim's.

31:00.942 --> 31:02.485
How we doin'?

31:02.485 --> 31:04.696
It was not premeditated.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.991
The weapon's too strange,
signs of a struggle everywhere.

31:08.950 --> 31:11.369
It was a crime of circumstance.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.829
Or sex crime, maybe.

31:12.829 --> 31:16.624
That I can't tell you.
The coroner will have to make that call.

31:16.624 --> 31:19.794
But those footprints in the utility room
do not belong to a man.

31:19.794 --> 31:21.129
They're too small.

31:21.921 --> 31:25.508
Think a woman did this.
A woman or a kid.

32:22.649 --> 32:25.985
He's about to step out
of the cab right now

32:25.985 --> 32:28.946
and this would be the first time
that he has been here after...

32:46.714 --> 32:48.800
How'd it happen, Dick?

32:48.800 --> 32:50.301
What all do you know?

32:51.969 --> 32:54.847
Just that she was shot.

32:57.433 --> 32:59.060
Well, that's wrong.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.062
- What happened?
- The weapon was an axe.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.356
And it was very brutal.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.358
Crime lab was here
until 8:00 this morning.

33:06.025 --> 33:07.568
It was all hell to clean up.

33:07.568 --> 33:10.196
I wish there was another way to say it,
to tell you.

33:20.248 --> 33:22.417
- I wasn't here.
- What?

33:25.336 --> 33:26.963
I wasn't here.

33:31.509 --> 33:32.927
Betty

33:34.095 --> 33:36.514
was always afraid when I go

33:37.640 --> 33:39.559
something would happen.

33:43.771 --> 33:46.691
She always said I should be here.
A husband

33:48.693 --> 33:50.319
should be home.

33:52.488 --> 33:54.407
And I wasn't here.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.526
Come on, sweetie.

34:32.278 --> 34:33.780
Daddy!

34:33.780 --> 34:35.406
Hi, sweetie.

34:35.406 --> 34:37.492
Oh, Allan.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.703
Allan. Oh, I'm so sorry.

34:40.703 --> 34:42.705
I'm so sorry.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.543
Princess! Cheeto!

34:47.543 --> 34:51.047
Is there anything that we can do for you?

34:51.881 --> 34:54.050
Just please don't leave yet.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.511
I'd like for you to be here

34:57.345 --> 34:59.138
when I tell her. I think that'd help.

34:59.138 --> 35:00.640
Of course.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.448
Sweetie, can I talk to you for a minute?

35:25.164 --> 35:26.582
Last night,

35:27.708 --> 35:30.837
somebody very bad came into the house

35:32.004 --> 35:32.964
and

35:34.507 --> 35:37.426
cut up Mommy very bad
and Mommy's not coming back.

35:40.721 --> 35:42.139
Understand?

36:11.419 --> 36:13.462
She was damn near dismembered
from what I'm told.

36:13.462 --> 36:14.547
Can you imagine?

36:14.547 --> 36:17.383
That's why I always say, use the deadbolt.

36:17.383 --> 36:19.510
Like she'd been put through a Veg-O-Matic.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.305
I'd just finished seeing "The Shining"

36:22.305 --> 36:24.515
when I got the news,
if you can believe that.

36:24.515 --> 36:26.309
Talk about bad dreams.

36:26.309 --> 36:27.894
Well, it had to be a drifter.

36:27.894 --> 36:31.272
A weapon like that during the day
in Wylie?

36:31.856 --> 36:34.901
Now, my bet is probably
either sex criminal

36:34.901 --> 36:37.320
or a burglar caught in the act.
And whoever it is,

36:37.320 --> 36:40.323
likely a thousand miles away by now.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.910
Honey, I'm gonna go speak to Don
for a second.

36:43.910 --> 36:45.494
Okay.

36:45.494 --> 36:47.830
It happened Friday,
today's Sunday.

36:47.830 --> 36:51.292
After 48 hours, the odds flop.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.879
- Hey, Don. Hi, y'all.
- Hi, Candy.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.506
We're just talking about it. Awful.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.635
Oh, yes. It is.

37:01.552 --> 37:04.430
Can I speak to you in private
for a second?

37:04.430 --> 37:07.642
- Sure.
- If that's alright. Okay. Thanks.

37:10.436 --> 37:13.272
Well, I guess you know that I was there
that mornin'.

37:13.272 --> 37:16.651
I was probably the last one
to see her alive.

37:17.318 --> 37:22.031
Well, I doubt the last.
Maybe second to last.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.741
Well, yeah, you know what I mean.

37:24.617 --> 37:27.995
Anyway, I'm supposed to speak
to the police this afternoon,

37:27.995 --> 37:30.498
and is there any reason
that I should be worried?

37:32.124 --> 37:33.918
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

37:33.918 --> 37:37.254
I was the last one seen
at the scene of the crime and everything

37:37.254 --> 37:40.383
and those are always the people
they arrest on the TV shows.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.594
Candy, they talk to everybody
in a case like this.

37:46.305 --> 37:48.599
And the way she was chopped up.

37:51.435 --> 37:56.899
Whoever did this had to be a very big man.

37:57.858 --> 38:00.152
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

38:01.779 --> 38:04.198
- Thanks, Don.
- Sure.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.743
Family and friends of the Gores
continue to gather...

38:12.790 --> 38:14.250
<i>My deepest sympathies.</i>

38:14.250 --> 38:16.460
I appreciate that.

38:18.295 --> 38:19.839
Bob's got Bethany in the bedroom.

38:19.839 --> 38:23.175
I think they both need a moment away
from all this.

38:24.885 --> 38:27.847
What about this Marriage Encounter thing?

38:27.847 --> 38:29.682
You and Betty went to that?

38:29.682 --> 38:32.018
We did, yes.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.561
Could it be someone from there?

38:33.561 --> 38:36.022
- I'm hearing it's like a cult.
- I don't--

38:36.731 --> 38:40.276
It wasn't anyone from Marriage Encounter.
It's not a cult.

38:41.444 --> 38:43.279
Why did you two go there?

38:46.407 --> 38:48.576
<i>They're evidently doing two services.</i>

38:48.576 --> 38:50.995
One here tomorrow
and the other in Norwich on Wednesday.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.707
And get this. Ron will be performing
the ceremony tomorrow.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.042
Ron Adams?

38:56.042 --> 38:57.501
Betty hated him.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.795
I know,
but they hadn't officially rejoined

38:59.795 --> 39:04.216
the Wylie Church so, technically,
Ron is still her pastor.

39:04.216 --> 39:07.261
- Oh, my God.
- Candy? Candy.

39:07.261 --> 39:09.930
Some of this food
needs to be put into the freezer.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.642
I'm afraid I can't get myself
to go into that room.

39:13.642 --> 39:15.352
Would you mind taking it in there for me?

39:15.352 --> 39:16.437
- Yeah, okay.
- Thank you.

39:52.139 --> 39:54.058
Hey! Hey! Stop!

39:55.518 --> 39:57.436
I'm sorry about those dogs.

39:57.436 --> 40:00.439
Anytime anyone comes in this room,
they bark like that.

40:04.068 --> 40:07.488
I'm Bertha.
I'm Betty's mother.

40:10.741 --> 40:12.952
I'm so sorry for your loss.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.496
Thank you.

40:17.456 --> 40:18.332
Excuse me.

40:36.684 --> 40:38.310
"Happy Father's Day, honey.

40:38.310 --> 40:40.729
"It really means a lot
to have a husband like you.

40:42.523 --> 40:46.360
"A lot of time, a lot of frustration.

40:46.360 --> 40:49.280
"A lot of headaches, a lot of worry,

40:49.280 --> 40:50.739
a lot of fun."

40:51.782 --> 40:54.034
That's so great. Thank you.

40:54.910 --> 40:56.203
You're welcome.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.416
Wow. Look at you.

41:01.167 --> 41:04.920
Oh, well, I'm not sure what one wears
to the police station,

41:04.920 --> 41:06.672
so I figured I might as well look nice.

41:07.506 --> 41:08.924
You sure you don't want me
to go with you?

41:09.884 --> 41:13.262
Oh, yeah. I'll drive myself.
They said it shouldn't take long.

41:13.262 --> 41:16.473
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

42:06.899 --> 42:08.859
<i>Well, let's just start from the beginning.</i>

42:08.859 --> 42:12.112
<i>The beginning would have been
vacation Bible school.</i>

42:12.112 --> 42:15.282
<i>And that would have started
about 9:00 in the morning</i>

42:15.282 --> 42:21.247
with a service ceremony sort of thing,
where I told one of my parables.

42:21.247 --> 42:23.040
"The Three Trees."

42:23.999 --> 42:25.459
Would you like to hear that?

42:25.459 --> 42:28.879
Oh, no. That's okay.
After the ceremony?

42:29.797 --> 42:32.007
After the ceremony, I left the church

42:32.007 --> 42:36.887
around 9:45,
and got to Betty's around 10:00.

42:36.887 --> 42:39.265
What was she doin'?

42:39.265 --> 42:41.600
She'd just put the baby down,

42:41.600 --> 42:45.104
and she was drinking a cup of coffee and

42:45.938 --> 42:51.193
sewing something out of yellow material.

42:51.193 --> 42:53.946
And she was about to watch "Phil Donahue."

42:53.946 --> 42:56.282
So, after you got there?

42:56.282 --> 43:00.452
Yes. We got to chattin'
about what to do with the children.

43:00.452 --> 43:05.165
And then, we went and played with the dogs
'cause they just got a new puppy.

43:05.165 --> 43:08.043
And then,
I told her about this new business

43:08.043 --> 43:13.465
that I've started with Sherry Cleckler,
a wallpapering and painting thing.

43:13.465 --> 43:16.552
And then I showed her one of my cards
and she thought that was cute.

43:16.552 --> 43:18.721
And maybe I can leave some for you all.

43:20.347 --> 43:22.766
After you showed her your business card?

43:23.642 --> 43:27.646
I went into the utility room
to get Alisa's suit

43:27.646 --> 43:30.941
and Betty went to grab
a towel to wrap it in.

43:31.567 --> 43:35.738
And then she handed me
some peppermint candies

43:35.738 --> 43:39.241
because Alisa doesn't like
to put her head under the water.

43:39.241 --> 43:44.913
And so, she sort of just
bribes her with the candies.

43:45.581 --> 43:48.500
What did you have on, clothes-wise?

43:48.500 --> 43:51.587
I was wearing a burgundy blouse
and blue jeans.

43:52.588 --> 43:54.757
What about shoes?

43:54.757 --> 43:57.176
We picked up some footprints
in the hallway

43:57.176 --> 44:00.095
and we need to screen the prints
for people we know

44:00.095 --> 44:01.930
who were in the house.

44:01.930 --> 44:05.351
I was wearing my blue tennis shoes.

44:05.351 --> 44:07.603
- Rubber soles?
- Yes.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.397
Do you have those shoes?

44:10.397 --> 44:13.275
Not with me but I could get them for you.

44:13.275 --> 44:16.570
How long do you think you were in there,
in total?

44:17.863 --> 44:20.366
About 15 minutes.

44:21.700 --> 44:23.452
And after?

44:23.452 --> 44:27.790
After, I went to Target in Plano
to get Father's Day cards

44:27.790 --> 44:30.084
but I noticed my watch stopped.

44:30.084 --> 44:32.169
It still said 10:15.

44:32.169 --> 44:35.589
And so, I asked someone what time it was,
and they said it was 11:10,

44:35.589 --> 44:37.591
meaning I was already late
for the puppet show.

44:38.258 --> 44:40.094
And so, I drove straight to the church

44:40.094 --> 44:42.262
and got there around 11:30
for the luncheon.

44:42.679 --> 44:47.601
And I didn't know that anything was wrong
until about 8:30

44:47.601 --> 44:49.436
when Allan called me to tell me

44:49.436 --> 44:52.231
that he was having a hard time
getting ahold of Betty.

45:07.413 --> 45:11.542
I'm not saying cancel it altogether.
Just, you know, postpone it some.

45:12.751 --> 45:16.088
Yes, I realize that they wanna go
and we will.

45:16.088 --> 45:18.966
It's just under the circumstances,

45:18.966 --> 45:21.969
it's not the best time to go to Six Flags,
that's all.

45:27.683 --> 45:29.810
Not just that she was
a popular school teacher,

45:29.810 --> 45:31.979
but, bear in mind,
this is the first murder

45:31.979 --> 45:35.315
of any kind in Wylie in 25 years.

45:35.315 --> 45:37.901
That it was committed with an axe
against an innocent woman

45:37.901 --> 45:40.446
in her own home in a nice neighborhood,

45:40.446 --> 45:43.240
you can understand why
this whole community is on edge.

45:43.240 --> 45:49.788
She was a loving mother,
a loyal wife, a committed person of faith.

45:51.081 --> 45:53.250
How can a thing like this happen

45:53.250 --> 45:56.628
to a person who is
so needed by her family?

45:58.172 --> 46:00.924
A mother so needed by her children.

46:01.508 --> 46:03.927
A daughter so loved by her parents.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.388
Perhaps there will be those
who look to God

46:07.306 --> 46:10.768
and say that He has some
eternal purpose in all of this.

46:12.269 --> 46:14.771
I cannot accept that.

46:14.771 --> 46:18.442
The notion that God would will
something like this upon anyone.

46:19.860 --> 46:22.446
This was not God's will.

46:22.446 --> 46:28.035
His will has been thwarted
by the actions and behavior of humanity.

46:28.827 --> 46:30.746
Humanity seems too kind a word.

46:31.705 --> 46:33.207
A monster.

46:33.916 --> 46:36.251
When things like this happen,

46:36.251 --> 46:41.048
God's will and purposes
then change to His ultimate will.

46:42.341 --> 46:44.259
This act was unnatural.

46:45.344 --> 46:46.762
It was evil.

46:50.599 --> 46:54.478
<i>I'm sorry,
but I feel like we've been over this.</i>

46:54.478 --> 46:58.524
Well, with me, you have,
but I want these boys to hear it as well.

46:59.399 --> 47:03.278
But we're trying to be
as painstaking as possible.

47:04.029 --> 47:06.490
I appreciate that.

47:06.490 --> 47:08.700
How were things with your marriage?

47:08.700 --> 47:11.370
- They were good.
- Yeah? She was secure in it?

47:14.373 --> 47:17.417
There was a time when she wasn't.

47:19.795 --> 47:21.004
You know, we've

47:23.173 --> 47:28.220
we had our issues,
specifically over the travel.

47:30.055 --> 47:33.433
She battled postpartum depression,
which was a strain,

47:33.433 --> 47:36.228
but things were improving of late.

47:36.228 --> 47:40.899
We'd gone to a church program
called Marriage Encounter

47:40.899 --> 47:44.069
and things were improving.

47:44.069 --> 47:47.823
So you can't think of anybody
that'd wanna hurt your wife?

47:47.823 --> 47:51.034
No. She didn't have any enemies,

47:51.034 --> 47:52.244
or--

47:53.453 --> 47:57.624
She wasn't too popular at her school
with her students.

47:57.624 --> 48:02.212
One time, our house was vandalized,
but I can't imagine

48:03.338 --> 48:04.756
that.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.260
If I could go back a second.

48:08.260 --> 48:13.265
You said that on Friday evening,
and then again on Saturday,

48:13.265 --> 48:16.018
you had several conversations
with Candy Montgomery?

48:16.727 --> 48:18.061
Yes.

48:18.061 --> 48:20.564
- She told you she was at the house?
- Yes.

48:20.564 --> 48:22.941
What else she tell you?

48:25.402 --> 48:27.321
That Betty seemed fine.

48:28.488 --> 48:33.702
Now, I apologize for having to ask this,
but can you think of a time

48:33.702 --> 48:36.496
where Betty might have had an affair
with another man?

48:42.794 --> 48:45.213
Yes, in 1971.

48:46.381 --> 48:48.050
We were living in Las Cruces.

48:48.800 --> 48:51.762
It was a time when I was traveling.

48:51.762 --> 48:55.515
She had a one-night stand
with a college student there

48:55.515 --> 48:57.309
at New Mexico State.

48:58.644 --> 49:01.563
I don't believe she ever
had another affair

49:03.190 --> 49:05.692
with any other man since then.

49:06.735 --> 49:08.987
Pretty sure about that?

49:08.987 --> 49:10.739
Yes.

49:10.739 --> 49:12.532
You ever had an affair yourself?

49:12.532 --> 49:14.326
No.

49:16.912 --> 49:21.541
Have anything else you wanna tell us
that could help us in the investigation?

49:22.042 --> 49:24.336
I can't think of anything at this time. No.

49:49.444 --> 49:50.654
Hello?

49:52.155 --> 49:55.409
Chief Abbott? It is Allan Gore calling.

49:56.785 --> 49:58.954
<i>I'm sorry to disturb you.</i>

50:00.539 --> 50:02.165
I was just calling

50:03.917 --> 50:10.173
to let you know that there was one thing
I was not truthful about.

50:10.882 --> 50:12.634
What's that, Allan?

50:16.263 --> 50:18.348
I did have an affair.

50:22.477 --> 50:24.396
With Candy Montgomery.
