taking any legal action.</i>

<i>He said it was an accident,
and I'm inclined to believe him.</i>

00:35.544 --> 00:38.923
He seems like a good boy,
unlike your other son.

00:39.007 --> 00:41.467
Thank you, sir.
You hear that, you jackals?

00:41.550 --> 00:42.985
The man with the badge said it.

00:42.986 --> 00:45.138
This five-alarm fire
was not the boy's fault!

00:45.221 --> 00:47.723
The witch hunt is over!
My son is innocent!

00:49.475 --> 00:51.894
What the fuck did you
do, you pyromaniac?!

00:51.978 --> 00:53.354
It was an accident!

00:53.437 --> 00:56.398
An accident is clipping a guy
changing his tire on the interstate

00:56.482 --> 00:59.068
who was wearing dark clothes
and he didn't light a flare.

00:59.152 --> 01:01.863
Then it turns out he's a cop, so
it'll be his word against yours,

01:01.946 --> 01:04.199
and who do you think the
judge is gonna believe? Huh?

01:04.282 --> 01:06.305
So you keep going,
and you get your fender

01:06.306 --> 01:08.328
painted in a different
state. That is an accident!

01:08.410 --> 01:10.141
OK! I wanted to prove you were wrong

01:10.142 --> 01:13.708
- when you called me a little pussy.
- I... I never said that!

01:13.791 --> 01:15.335
How did he hear you say that?

01:15.417 --> 01:17.378
I can't find the dog anywhere!

01:17.461 --> 01:20.131
I think he ran away when
the fireworks exploded!

01:20.215 --> 01:22.591
Ah, Jesus. Oh, no, buddy...

01:22.675 --> 01:26.679
Oh, so help me God, if I
started building walls today

01:26.762 --> 01:28.347
and didn't stop for the next ten years,

01:28.348 --> 01:29.932
there still wouldn't be enough of them

01:30.016 --> 01:32.560
- to fucking put you through!
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:32.643 --> 01:35.395
We're all forgetting
something very important.

01:35.479 --> 01:38.816
I am now the good son.

01:39.325 --> 01:41.436
Deal with it. [slurps]

01:42.444 --> 01:46.324

We both know if you guys strike at
midnight, the airline will not survive.

02:43.005 --> 02:45.674
Dad, keep it down. I can't
concentrate on my drawing.

02:45.758 --> 02:46.926
[softly] Shut up.

02:47.009 --> 02:48.970
Pogo is presenting my
proposal to Dunbarton.

02:49.053 --> 02:50.679
If you can get your guys behind it,

02:50.763 --> 02:52.932
we can avert the strike
and save all our jobs.

02:53.015 --> 02:55.184
You happy now? I just
gave the dog two dicks.

02:55.268 --> 02:57.437

us a double-dicked dog!

[giggling]
[softly] Hey!

02:58.646 --> 03:00.231
Don't talk like that
in front of your sister.

03:00.315 --> 03:03.401
Ow! I'm outta here anyway.
I have a job to go to.

03:03.483 --> 03:06.446
Because now I'm the responsible son!

03:06.528 --> 03:08.656
Oh, shit, I'm an hour late.

03:09.573 --> 03:12.118
Thanks, Rosie. That means a lot.
I'll see you there.

'Tis the day before Christmas!

03:16.686 --> 03:19.875
Mwah.
I'm so excited. And late.

03:19.959 --> 03:21.336
- It's OK, Sue.
- No.

03:21.419 --> 03:23.921
I admit, I've got some catching
up to do as far as the decorating.

03:24.005 --> 03:26.132
It's only natural. You've
been busy working your job.

03:26.215 --> 03:27.591
Which I am 100 percent behind.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.594
I know you are. I just got
a late start, that's all.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.472
I'll have us ready for our
Christmas party tonight.

03:32.554 --> 03:35.599
Honey, I really wish I could help you,
but Dunbarton called a meeting.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.518
It sounds like they're
gonna go for my proposal.

03:37.601 --> 03:38.853
- That's great.
- Yeah!

03:38.936 --> 03:41.105
I think we can wrap this
up in the next few hours.

03:41.189 --> 03:42.731
It's fine, I can get it done.

03:42.815 --> 03:44.650
Honey, we don't have to
do the party this year.

03:44.733 --> 03:47.278
Are you kidding me? This year
is more important than ever.

03:47.362 --> 03:49.822
We have some fence-mending to
do around this neighborhood.

03:49.905 --> 03:51.866
Speaking of which, the
Petersen's fence burned down.

03:51.949 --> 03:53.075

have to be at church?

03:57.746 --> 04:00.582
Well, he's gonna get there an
hour early. I got shit to do.

04:04.504 --> 04:06.547
Hey, keep this guy away
from the punch bowl.

04:06.630 --> 04:08.966
Last year he tried to jump off the roof.

04:09.050 --> 04:09.925
Hey, Frank!

04:10.009 --> 04:12.887
Great. Get in the car and don't
touch the cigarette lighter.

04:12.970 --> 04:15.473
Frankie, I'm having
an outta-sight wing-ding later.

04:15.556 --> 04:20.019
Love it if you and Suzie-Q could come.
Forecast calls for "snow."

Goddamn it, I just shoveled.

It's gonna be a blast.

Hot cider, ice skating.

Some of my dwarf buddies
are coming, they're wild.

04:30.279 --> 04:32.948
I saw one eat a two-pound steak once!

04:37.036 --> 04:40.998
- Here we are, in you go.
- Why do I have to be an altar boy?

04:41.082 --> 04:44.001
Ah, 'cause church will set you
straight. It's good for you.

04:44.085 --> 04:45.336
Then how come you never go?

04:45.420 --> 04:48.256
Because I already heard
those stories a hundred times.

04:48.339 --> 04:51.384
Look, if Jesus comes back and
he does some more magical shit,

04:51.467 --> 04:53.969
I'll come down and listen to that.
Now get in there.

Would you show Bill the ropes?

05:34.009 --> 05:37.513
Sure thing, Father. I'll show
him the shit outta the ropes.

straight. My diaper's froze.

two days straight with no food

06:07.042 --> 06:09.669

Mr. Dunbarton. It's really
good to see you again.

06:21.098 --> 06:24.726
Frank Murphy. Pogo told
me about your proposal.

06:24.810 --> 06:26.437
It's smart. Real smart.

06:26.521 --> 06:28.648
- You've made me proud, Frank.
- Thank you, sir.

06:28.730 --> 06:29.565
[car door slams]

06:30.566 --> 06:33.319
My shop steward tells me we have a deal?

06:33.402 --> 06:36.738
Yes. If you accept the smaller
cost of living increase,

06:36.822 --> 06:40.159
- we won't cut any union jobs.
- We can live with that.

06:40.242 --> 06:43.745
Fine. Let's draw the contracts
up and get this over with.

06:43.829 --> 06:45.831
And not a minute too soon.

06:45.914 --> 06:50.002
I'm due back in Indiana.
Gotta be in Gary by midnight.

06:50.085 --> 06:53.839
Well, I want to be in Brandy
by midnight. [chortling]

06:53.922 --> 06:56.676

07:40.689 --> 07:42.064
trees to hard-working idiots.

07:43.358 --> 07:48.154
- So, I guess this is where you pay me?
- Oh, no, no, no, you're not done.

07:48.237 --> 07:51.449
You don't get paid
till all the trees are sold.

Stupid festive dildo.

So what, your folks make you do this
'cause you torched the woods?

08:23.856 --> 08:25.441
- Yeah.
- I hear ya.

08:25.525 --> 08:28.319
I'm here for sticking
a pencil in the milk man's leg.

Asshole wouldn't give me heavy cream!

08:30.863 --> 08:34.409
[chuckles] Can I ask you something?
Why haven't you killed me yet?

08:34.491 --> 08:37.119
Took a lot of balls
to go psycho like that.

08:37.203 --> 08:39.914
And I respect the fuck outta balls!

08:39.996 --> 08:41.039
Hey, keep a look out.

- Hey, that's for the poor.
- So what? I'm poor.

08:47.255 --> 08:49.382
Take this and keep your mouth shut.

08:49.465 --> 08:50.966
What do I do with it?

08:51.050 --> 08:54.178
Just put it in your bra and say,
"Thank you, Jimmy."

08:54.262 --> 08:57.515
You and me are gonna
get along just fine.

08:59.267 --> 09:02.478
I'm glad we could reach
a deal without resorting

09:02.479 --> 09:05.689
to more ungentlemanly
means, methods or tactics.

09:05.773 --> 09:09.485
Thankfully, we'll only be using
our shovels for snow this year.

09:09.569 --> 09:11.078
Well said.

09:13.697 --> 09:16.284
Since Frank Murphy
brokered the agreement,

09:16.367 --> 09:21.247
we've given him the honor of
distributing the ceremonial pens.

09:34.385 --> 09:36.720
Can I get a pen, too?

09:36.804 --> 09:39.890
Oh, no, it's just for those two.
There's only two pens.

09:39.974 --> 09:42.726
What are you saying? Brandy
isn't good enough to have a pen?

09:42.810 --> 09:45.729
No, she's great. It's just that she's
not a signatory of this legal document.

09:45.813 --> 09:48.608
- So she's a common whore, is that right?
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

09:48.690 --> 09:52.194
- You think she's just my fuck doll?
- Everybody thinks that, but I don't!

09:52.278 --> 09:53.529
What the hell is going on?

09:53.613 --> 09:56.991
Yes, come on! Let's just
focus on signing the deal!

09:57.074 --> 09:58.326
There is no deal!

09:58.409 --> 10:02.538
- Then we are calling this strike right now!
- Go ahead!

10:02.622 --> 10:06.167
I wouldn't shake the hand of
any man who disrespects my wife!

10:06.250 --> 10:08.085
I thought that was your daughter.

10:08.169 --> 10:11.464
You think I'd fuck something
as old as my daughter?!

10:11.547 --> 10:14.216
- I will drown you!
- No, no, no, no! Put that away!

10:16.260 --> 10:17.761
Tree!

10:18.679 --> 10:21.265
Nice trees! Want to buy a tree?

Ah, shit.

Oh, don't look at me like that.
These aren't the body of Christ

during transubstantiation.

10:50.169 --> 10:53.297
Here, take a swig.
Come on, drink it!

Uh, OK, sure.

Leper, whore, whore,
whore, whore, leper, whore.

11:14.652 --> 11:15.903
[door closes]
Good, he's gone.

11:15.986 --> 11:18.113
Now listen up.
Tonight, during the sermon,

11:18.197 --> 11:20.999
we're gonna come back here
and break into this safe

11:21.000 --> 11:25.037
- and get us some gold chalices.
- What? Uh, I don't think...

11:25.120 --> 11:27.873
The combination is written down
here somewhere. Help me find it.

11:27.956 --> 11:30.918
- I don't want to do this.
- I don't want to beat the fuck outta you,

11:30.919 --> 11:32.503
either, but I will if you don't help me.

11:32.587 --> 11:34.547
You can do what you want,
but I'm not doing it.

11:34.630 --> 11:36.298
- Do it!
- Ow! No!

- God, yeah!

13:39.434 --> 13:40.548
[honking]

13:40.631 --> 13:43.425
- What the fuck?!
- How's it going, Frank?

13:43.509 --> 13:45.927
Why is there a person and a half
fucking on the hood of my car?

13:46.011 --> 13:50.307
Because he's a man, Frank.
A man named Skee-Ball.

13:50.391 --> 13:54.770
A man with desires,
just like you and me.

13:54.854 --> 13:58.733
But the only job society lets him
have is playing an elf at the mall.

13:58.816 --> 14:03.362
Or the occasional cookie commercial.
Frank, this man earned this.

14:03.445 --> 14:06.448
Let him fuck on your car.

14:07.783 --> 14:11.255
- Thanks, Vic. You get me.
- But I wanna know who's gonna

14:11.290 --> 14:13.414
pay for the tiny ass dent
on the hood of my car.

14:13.497 --> 14:14.874
It's all good, man.

14:14.956 --> 14:18.064
No, it's not, Vic. It's not all good!

14:18.878 --> 14:19.920
Sue?

14:21.380 --> 14:23.841
- Ah, Christ.
- That's all I get from you?

14:23.924 --> 14:26.134
As hard as I've been working
all day for the party?

14:26.218 --> 14:29.471
Oh, what party? There is no party!
We're on strike!

14:29.555 --> 14:32.266
- What?!
- It's a long story. We were gonna sign!

14:32.349 --> 14:33.684
There were fancy pens!

14:33.768 --> 14:37.020
He's got a trophy wife, they
were shiny. It all fell apart!

14:37.104 --> 14:38.939
We can't let it ruin Christmas!

14:39.022 --> 14:41.233
Christmas?
This is the real world, Susan!

14:41.316 --> 14:43.793
If this doesn't work out,
next year we'll be having

14:43.794 --> 14:46.271
- Christmas on Skid Row!
- Keep your voice down!

14:46.272 --> 14:48.323
We have to put on
a brave face for the kids.

14:48.407 --> 14:51.285
The kids?
Who, the flunky? The pyro?

14:51.368 --> 14:53.579
Mr. Fucking Coconut? Face it, Sue.

14:53.662 --> 14:56.916
- Our family is pretty fucked up!
- How dare you say that!

14:57.040 --> 15:00.711
Dad, I need 20 bucks so I can
tell my boss I sold these trees.

15:00.795 --> 15:04.715
- And 50 bucks to fix a guy's windshield.
- Exhibit A!

15:04.799 --> 15:09.386
I looked everywhere and I still
can't find Major! [sobbing]

15:09.470 --> 15:12.556
- What if he's dead?
- Oh, then he's the lucky one!

15:12.640 --> 15:14.600
Frank Murphy, you stop that right now!

15:14.683 --> 15:17.582
- Honey, he didn't mean that.
- Seriously, Dad, I need that money.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.481
- That guy said he might sue you.
- Well, he'd better do it quick.

15:21.732 --> 15:25.527
- Jimmy Fitzsimmons is coming to kill me!
- Oh, there you go, perfect!

15:25.611 --> 15:29.114
Let's just bring all the
bad news at once! Whoo!

15:29.197 --> 15:31.283
Come on, Santa,
my mouth's wide open!

15:31.366 --> 15:33.702
Fly up on the roof
and shit down my neck!

15:33.786 --> 15:36.497
<i>[thudding]
Hey! Murphy!</i>

15:36.580 --> 15:40.292
Where is the little
shit who hurt my son?

15:40.375 --> 15:41.585
Great.

15:42.920 --> 15:46.534
- Can I help you?
- Your kid almost killed my kid.

15:46.569 --> 15:48.008
Little prick looks OK to me.

15:48.091 --> 15:51.219
He tried to get my son
to rob the church!

15:51.303 --> 15:53.973
- That's not true!
- Yes, it is, you liar!

15:54.055 --> 15:55.766
Leave Bill alone, piss breath!

15:55.850 --> 15:59.394
It's not my fault!
I have a dead tooth!

15:59.478 --> 16:03.106
- Go away, Jimmy!
- She tried to gouge my eyes out!

16:03.190 --> 16:06.743
- Christ, are all your kids psycho?
- Hey! Hey!

16:06.778 --> 16:09.237
Nobody calls one
of my kids a psycho except me!

16:09.321 --> 16:10.781
- Thanks, Dad.
- Shut up!

16:10.865 --> 16:13.646
You are way outta line
coming over to my house

16:13.647 --> 16:15.691
and insulting my family.
You owe us all an apology.

16:15.818 --> 16:19.832
Ooh! "Apology!"
Somebody went to college.

16:19.915 --> 16:22.167
I didn't go to college, I went to Korea.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.712
You should've stayed
there, you piece of shit!

16:24.795 --> 16:27.172
- Watch your mouth.
- Mind your own business,

16:49.486 --> 16:51.446
Get the fuck off my lawn!

16:51.530 --> 16:53.448
Your whole family's crazy!

16:53.532 --> 16:56.410
I've got the best family
in this whole goddamn town!

16:56.493 --> 16:58.328
And don't you ever come back!

16:58.412 --> 16:59.997
You mean that about us?

17:00.080 --> 17:02.624
[panting]
You're damn right, I do.

17:02.708 --> 17:05.292
- You all right, champ?
- Fine.

17:05.377 --> 17:07.127
Jesus Christ, I'm outta shape.

17:08.296 --> 17:10.840
- Thanks, Dad.
- OK, all right, all right.

17:10.925 --> 17:12.509
There's dwarves watching.

17:15.637 --> 17:17.472
[Sue kisses]
[Frank chuckles]

17:17.556 --> 17:19.767
- We got some good kids.
- They're OK.

Major!

17:23.896 --> 17:27.147
[Major whining]
Major, I missed you so much!

17:27.232 --> 17:30.027
Oh, there you are, boy!
You're home!

17:30.110 --> 17:34.740
And you're still just as fat.
What've you been eating?

17:34.823 --> 17:39.057
- Well, I guess I should be going.
- Ah, get back in here,

17:39.092 --> 17:41.963
you lonely old bastard!
Come on, we're having a party!

17:42.623 --> 17:45.834

Nah, nah, nah, that's just

- If I don't, it's just gonna get worse.

OK, you go do what you gotta do. 
We'll be here for you.

the opportunity to go home to
their families on Christmas.

18:34.508 --> 18:37.719

a gutless play by the union.

18:40.221 --> 18:41.974

Maybe that's why they call
it "the good ol' days."

18:46.394 --> 18:48.438
- Mr. Dunbarton.
- What do you want?

18:48.522 --> 18:51.191
Sir, I just left my
wife and kids back home.

18:51.274 --> 18:54.194
We had a terrible Christmas
Eve, but we stuck together

18:54.195 --> 18:57.114
and got through it, because
that's what a family does.

18:57.197 --> 18:59.774
And I'd like to think
all of us at Mohican,

18:59.775 --> 19:04.913
- well, we're a family too.
- Who the fuck told Andy Williams to come?

19:04.997 --> 19:07.499
Let him speak, Bob. 
You have something to say?

19:07.582 --> 19:09.168
We've gotta get this.

19:09.250 --> 19:12.453
<i>I know it's a little
schmaltzy, but we are a family</i>

<i>We were all set to sign that
deal today and avoid this strike.</i>

19:17.968 --> 19:20.721
<i>But you let it fall
apart because of a pen.</i>

19:20.804 --> 19:23.515
<i>And your wife, who some of
us thought was your daughter.</i>

19:23.598 --> 19:25.851
<i>Mr. Dunbarton, you're
the head of this family.</i>

19:25.934 --> 19:27.978
<i>And only you can pull us together.</i>

19:28.062 --> 19:31.398
<i>You can stick to your pride and ego, 
trust me, I've been there,</i>

19:31.481 --> 19:36.820
<i>or you can get past all that and sign
the fair contract we all agreed to.</i>

19:36.904 --> 19:38.372
<i>So what do you say?</i>

19:38.444 --> 19:41.742
<i>Sign this deal and save
the Mohican Airways family.</i>

19:45.704 --> 19:48.749
<i>Murphy, your words are very moving.</i>

19:48.832 --> 19:53.045
And I think I can find a way to make
this deal work and make me happy.

Congratulations, Frank. Your
little sermon saved the airline.

20:43.344 --> 20:44.554
Ah, thanks, Bob.

Tell Mr. Dunbarton if there's
anything he needs, I'll do it.

- Well, there is one thing...
- Anything, just name it!

- What?
- You're done, Frank.

20:55.315 --> 20:57.734

20:57.818 --> 21:01.238
No, no, he's firing
you on Christmas Eve.

That way you can watch your kids
open the presents you can't afford.

21:05.242 --> 21:08.912
You blew it, Frank!
You insulted Dunbarton!

21:08.996 --> 21:13.083
- All I did was appeal to his humanity.
- Exactly.

21:13.167 --> 21:16.044
Bob. I got a family to feed. 
What am I gonna do?

21:16.128 --> 21:18.797
Not my problem, you fucking traitor.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.549
It was a mistake to promote you anyway.

You weren't fit for management.
Happy Holidays.

21:27.139 --> 21:29.308

 We're done here.

21:29.390 --> 21:32.560
- You are, but I'm not.
- What are you doing?

21:32.644 --> 21:35.981
Not fit for management? I've been
carrying you for three months.

She loves you.

23:52.695 --> 23:55.203

Hey, slow it down, hot sauce!
[bellowing]

<i>You're on a bad trip, brother!</i>

24:04.212 --> 24:07.257
<i>Let me talk you down! 
Have a little O.J.</i>

24:07.341 --> 24:10.177
<i>Hey, hey! [voice fading]
I'll rub your hooves!</i>
