00:13.447 --> 00:14.915
MY HAIR DRYER BLEW UP

00:14.982 --> 00:15.783

00:18.819 --> 00:20.721
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK RUINS
A SMOOTHIE?

00:20.788 --> 00:21.622

00:30.030 --> 00:31.565
WE ARE SPENDING
WAY TOO MUCH TIME TOGETHER.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.640
I'M STARTING

WE HAVE A DAY OFF.

02:01.822 --> 02:02.756

02:02.823 --> 02:04.024
ALONE.

02:04.091 --> 02:06.460
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

02:06.527 --> 02:09.297
- I'M GONNA START
MY ACTING CAREER.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.532
THIS FACE NEEDS
TO BE ON THE BIG SCREEN.

02:11.599 --> 02:12.866
OOH.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.803
RIGHT.

PHOEBE NACHEE.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.875
SHE COMBINES
MY TWO FAVORITE THINGS:

02:21.942 --> 02:23.977
GIRLS AND MATH.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.679
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO YET,

02:25.746 --> 02:28.816
BUT IT'LL BE
TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.285
HEY, WHERE'S MY HELMET?

02:31.352 --> 02:32.986
MY HELMET'S GONE.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.463
HELP ME FIND IT.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.233

02:45.233 --> 02:47.335
- AH!

02:48.536 --> 02:49.970
[grunting frantically]

02:50.037 --> 02:52.039
WHO'S GONNA HELP ME FIND
MY HELMET?

02:52.105 --> 02:53.241
AH-HA-HA!

02:53.241 --> 02:54.608

02:57.044 --> 02:59.480

ON THE NEW GIRL?

03:20.968 --> 03:22.870
- I'M NOT SPYING.

03:22.936 --> 03:26.407
I'M SECRETLY OBSERVING HER
FROM AFAR.

03:26.474 --> 03:27.975
- THAT'S SPYING.
- KATIE.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.344
- DOESN'T SHE HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

03:30.411 --> 03:32.446
- YES,
AND IT WOULD BE WRONG OF ME

03:32.513 --> 03:35.349
TO ASK A GIRL OUT
WHO'S ALREADY TAKEN.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.350
RIGHT?

03:36.417 --> 03:37.318
- OH, PLEASE.

03:44.157 --> 03:47.628
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD...

03:47.695 --> 03:48.796
HANG OUT.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.130
- YOU KNOW I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.165
- WHICH IS AWESOME.

03:52.300 --> 03:56.370
AND IT'S ALSO AWESOME
BEING JUST FRIENDS WITH GIRLS.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.372
IT'S COOL.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.974
- WELL, I WAS JUST
ABOUT TO HIT THE GYM,

04:01.041 --> 04:02.776
AND I COULD USE
A TRAINING PARTNER.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.978
WANT TO COME ALONG,
JUST FRIEND?

04:05.045 --> 04:06.847
- YES.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.650
I MEAN, WHAT ARE WE DOING,

04:09.717 --> 04:11.218

OH.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.663
[grunts]

04:22.730 --> 04:24.732

AS GOOD AS YOU FALL?

04:24.798 --> 04:26.900
- OH, NO.

04:26.967 --> 04:31.171
- JUST LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.407
- I COULD DO THIS ALL DAY.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.042
- BOYFRIEND.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.477
- AH!

04:36.544 --> 04:38.479

04:38.546 --> 04:41.749

04:41.815 --> 04:43.684
I'LL TURN YOU INTO A--

04:43.751 --> 04:44.952
HEY, WHAT
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

04:45.018 --> 04:46.219
- OH, I'M NOT THINKING.

04:46.354 --> 04:49.823
I'M ACTING LIKE I'M THINKING.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.360
COME ON,
TELL ME THIS FACE

04:52.360 --> 04:53.994
DOESN'T BELONG
ON THE BIG SCREEN.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.697
- JAMES, ACTING IS ABOUT MORE
THAN JUST BEING PRETTY.

04:56.764 --> 04:57.798
- I KNOW.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.900
IT'S ALSO ABOUT WASHBOARD ABS.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.034
CHECK IT.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.370
OH-AH, OH-AH, OH-AH.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.471
- NOT BAD.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.439
BUT ACTING
IS NOT SOMETHING YOU DO.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.008
IT'S SOMETHING YOU ARE.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.578
- OH, WILL YOU TEACH ME
YOUR EXPERT ACTING WAYS?

05:10.644 --> 05:11.779
- TCHA.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.280
I WOULDN'T TEACH YOU
IF YOU BEGGED ME

05:13.381 --> 05:15.583
WITH YOUR LAST DYING BREATH.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.750
- REALLY?

05:16.817 --> 05:17.785

05:17.851 --> 05:19.086
SEE, THAT WAS ACTING.

05:19.152 --> 05:23.391
WELCOME TO THE CAMILLE ACADEMY

05:52.820 --> 05:53.854
- OH, WELL, IN THAT CASE,

05:53.921 --> 05:55.188
STILL NOT A GIRL.

05:55.255 --> 05:56.724
- OKAY, I DON'T THINK PHOEBE

05:56.790 --> 05:58.759
WOULD LIKE YOU TALKING
TO ONE OF HER FANS LIKE THAT.

05:58.826 --> 06:01.862

06:34.027 --> 06:35.663
- OH, WELL...

06:35.729 --> 06:37.064
I MISSED MY BOY.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.231

06:38.298 --> 06:39.467

I'M HERE.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.035

10:10.110 --> 10:12.079
- HEY, IT'S MY FAVORITE TIE.

10:20.220 --> 10:25.158
- NO, MOM, I'M SPENDING THE DAY
WITH A VERY NICE BOY.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.828
NO, HE THINKS I HAVE
A BOYFRIEND.

10:27.895 --> 10:32.299
CAREER FIRST, BOYFRIEND LATER,
REMEMBER?

10:32.365 --> 10:33.667
HE'S VERY CUTE.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.481

10:48.548 --> 10:50.283

10:50.350 --> 10:52.219
BUT I'M A LITTLE BUSY

10:52.285 --> 10:55.789
OW. OW. OW. OW. OW. OW. OW.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.257
- YOU ARE A CHUMP.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.459
- WHAT, FOR GOING AFTER
A GIRL WHO HAS A BOYFRIEND?

10:59.526 --> 11:02.129
- NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING AFTER
A GIRL WHO'S LYING

11:02.195 --> 11:04.231
ABOUT HAVING A BOYFRIEND.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.401
- SAY WHAT?

11:11.739 --> 11:13.440
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
JO DOESN'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

11:13.506 --> 11:14.808
- I HEARD HER TALKING
TO HER MOTHER.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.243
THE WHOLE BOYFRIEND THING
IS A SCAM.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.111
NOW, LOOK AT HER
AND GIVE HER THE ONE SECOND

11:18.178 --> 11:20.748
"MY LITTLE SISTER'S CRAZY"
GESTURE.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.419
- SHE'S BEEN PLAYING ME
THIS WHOLE TIME?

11:26.486 --> 11:27.755
- LIKE A FIDDLE.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.389
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT IT, BIG BROTHER?

11:29.456 --> 11:31.191
AND REMEMBER,
I LOOK UP TO YOU.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.559
- OH, YOU DON'T WORRY.

11:32.625 --> 11:33.660
IT'S ON.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.566
- IS YOUR SISTER OKAY?

11:39.632 --> 11:42.102
- SHE'S GREAT.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.437
NOW, LET'S TALK,
JUST FRIEND TO JUST FRIEND.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.373
- YOU GOT IT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

11:46.439 --> 11:48.041
- YOUR BOYFRIEND.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.777
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
WHAT'S HIS FAVORITE SPORT?

11:49.810 --> 11:51.144
IS HE ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH?

11:51.211 --> 11:54.447
- OH, WELL, UM...

11:54.514 --> 11:58.051
TRAVIS DOESN'T REALLY TALK
ABOUT SPORTS OR HIS ALLERGIES.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.254
- YOU SURE YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

12:01.321 --> 12:02.589
I MEAN, I'VE HEARD STORIES
OF GIRLS

12:02.655 --> 12:04.057
WHO MAKE UP FAKE BOYFRIENDS.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.794
BUT YOU WOULD NEVER DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

12:06.794 --> 12:07.795
WOULD YOU?

12:07.861 --> 12:09.096
- NO.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.364
IN FACT, MY TOTALLY REAL
BOYFRIEND TRAVIS

12:11.431 --> 12:13.533
IS COMING TO VISIT ME

12:13.600 --> 12:14.802
TODAY.

12:14.835 --> 12:15.803
- HMM.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.537
[silently]

12:17.604 --> 12:20.073
WELL, I CAN'T WAIT
TO MEET HIM.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.875
- WELL, I CAN'T WAIT
FOR YOU TO MEET HIM.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.576
- I'LL BE RELAXING
AND WAITING IN THE LOBBY.

12:23.643 --> 12:24.611
- GREAT.
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

12:24.677 --> 12:25.578
- GREAT.
- GREAT.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.380
both: GREAT.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.552

THIS AUDITION, JAMES,

12:32.619 --> 12:36.489
WE'RE BOTH GOING TO BE
ON WITCHES OF RODEO DRIVE.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.625
WE'LL BE A TEAM.

12:38.691 --> 12:41.428
- WHY ARE WE THE ONLY ACTORS
HERE IN COSTUMES?

12:41.494 --> 12:43.864
- THAT, JAMES, IS BECAUSE WE

12:43.931 --> 12:45.833
HAVE SURRENDERED OURSELVES
TO THE ROLES.

12:45.866 --> 12:49.837
AND THEY HAVE NOT.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.505
- I THINK I HAVE BUTTERFLIES
IN MY STOMACH.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.674
RIGHT BEHIND MY WASHBOARD ABS.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.144
- ENOUGH WITH THE ABS.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.912
AND DON'T BE NERVOUS.

12:58.979 --> 13:03.150
I GOT A MAGIC SPELL
UP MY SLEEVE.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.218
SEE, IF YOU THOUGHT
THE BABY POWDER BIT WAS GOOD,

13:05.285 --> 13:08.221
WAIT TILL THEY GET
A LOAD OF THIS PUPPY.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.423
- CAMILLE?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.960
- POOH.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.563

NAILED IT.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.943
[coughing]

13:30.010 --> 13:31.879
- JAMES DIAMOND IS NEXT.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.949
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY EXPLOSIVES ON YOU, DO YOU?

13:36.016 --> 13:37.985
- NO.
- THEN COME ON IN.

13:39.352 --> 13:43.056
SO JUST STAND ON THE MARK.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.225
AND LET'S BEGIN.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.695
- ONCE I CURSE CHAD
WITH THE ZIT OF GRIMBLEZOR,

13:48.761 --> 13:51.932
THEN I SHALL BE
HOMECOMING WARLOCK.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.401
LAUGHS EVILLY.

13:54.467 --> 13:58.271
OH, UH, AH-HA-HA-HA-HA!

13:58.338 --> 13:59.706
- OKAY.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.208
UH, LET'S DO IT AGAIN,

14:01.274 --> 14:03.310
AND THIS TIME
JUST FORGET THE WORDS.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.777
JUST STAND THERE AND SMILE.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.183
- * YOU WANT TO BE FAMOUS *

14:10.250 --> 14:11.751
- * FAMOUS *

14:11.818 --> 14:17.457
- * YOU WANT TO BE THE ONE
WHO'S LIVING THE LIFE *

14:20.293 --> 14:21.428
- WELL?

14:21.494 --> 14:23.931
- SHE SAID SHE'D LET US KNOW
BY 3:00.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.666
- I JUST KNOW WE'RE BOTH
GOING TO GET THIS ONE, JAMES.

14:26.733 --> 14:30.103
WITCHES OF RODEO DRIVE,
HERE WE COME.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.704
AND NOW,

14:31.771 --> 14:33.440

14:33.506 --> 14:35.308

14:39.212 --> 14:42.849
JAMES, ARE--

14:44.451 --> 14:45.518
- OKAY.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.487
TIME FOR THE LOBBY TEST.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.589
IF YOU CAN MAKE IT
THROUGH THOSE FRONT DOORS,

14:49.656 --> 14:51.591
YOU CAN MAKE IT
INTO THAT GIRL'S SCHOOL.

14:51.658 --> 14:52.960
- HOW'S IT GOING?

14:52.960 --> 14:55.295
- HEY. CHILLIN'.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.529
BLEEP-BLAP-BLOOP.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.365
- OKAY, YOU FAILED
THE FIRST TEST.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.267
TRY SPEAKING A LITTLE HIGHER.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.734

OH, HEY, GIRL.

15:16.849 --> 15:17.884
HMM-HMM-HMM-HMM.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.386
WHOO-HOO!

15:19.452 --> 15:21.788
WHOO!

15:21.854 --> 15:24.491
- OKAY,
ENOUGH WITH THE STAPLES.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.693
THESE SUITS COME OUT
OF MY SALARY,

15:26.759 --> 15:28.295
AND SO DO THE STAPLES.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.763
- THEN TELL ME WHY YOU WENT
INTO MY SON'S APARTMENT.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.232
- AND WHERE'S MY HELMET?

15:32.299 --> 15:35.568
- OKAY, SOMEBODY STOLE
MY BOLOGNA.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.304
AND I WENT INTO
A FEW APARTMENTS TO LOOK FOR IT,

15:37.370 --> 15:38.671
BUT I COULDN'T FIND IT.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.207
- WHEN WAS THE BOLOGNA
LAST SEEN?

15:40.273 --> 15:41.674
- THIS MORNING.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.010
I WOULDN'T WANT THIS TO GET OUT,

15:43.076 --> 15:44.577
BUT THERE'S BEEN
A STEALING SPREE

15:44.644 --> 15:46.413
AT THE PALMWOODS.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.082
SOMEONE STOLE A LAVA LAMP
FROM APARTMENT 3B,

15:49.149 --> 15:51.118
A DISCO BALL FROM THE GAME ROOM,

15:51.184 --> 15:54.221
AND A BEARSKIN RUG
FROM MY OFFICE.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.555
- HIDE ME.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.891
MY MOM WANTS ME
TO BE IN A DIAPER COMMERCIAL.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.327
- TYLER, WHERE ARE YOU?

16:00.393 --> 16:02.229
WE'RE LATE.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.564
both: HE WENT THAT WAY!

16:08.768 --> 16:10.370
- COME HERE, KID.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.139
I SAW YOU GO

16:12.205 --> 16:13.706
WHERE'S THE HELMET?

16:13.773 --> 16:15.775
- I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS HIDING FROM MY MOM.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.244
AND YOUR HELMET WAS STOLEN?

16:17.310 --> 16:20.747
MY FROGGY SLIPPERS
WERE STOLEN.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.515
- WELL, IF TYLER DIDN'T DO IT

16:22.582 --> 16:24.951
AND MR. BITTERS DIDN'T DO IT,

16:25.052 --> 16:27.387
THAT ONLY LEAVES ONE SUSPECT.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.562
[upbeat pop music]

16:35.628 --> 16:38.465
* *

16:38.531 --> 16:40.400

16:55.115 --> 16:56.116
WHEN ARE THEY GONNA CALL?

16:56.183 --> 16:57.684
- THEY'LL CALL.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.553
BUT REMEMBER, DON'T GET UPSET
IF WE DON'T GET A ROLE.

17:00.620 --> 17:05.625
ANOTHER PART OF ACTING
IS CONQUERING REJECTION.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.390
TOO BAD.

DID YOU JUST HEAR ME?

17:40.127 --> 17:41.894
- WELL, THANKS FOR CALLING.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.330
UH, MY ACTING COACH
DID SAY I NEED

17:43.396 --> 17:44.997
TO LEARN TO HANDLE REJECTION.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.566
- ARE YOU INSANE?
I SAID YOU--

17:46.633 --> 17:47.600
- UH.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.869

17:51.638 --> 17:54.941
OH! I DIDN'T GET

17:55.007 --> 17:57.144
- YOU DIDN'T?

17:57.177 --> 17:59.479
LOOK, DON'T FEEL BAD.

17:59.546 --> 18:03.015
I DIDN'T GET A PART
UNTIL MY 32ND AUDITION.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.485
WE'LL GET 'EM NEXT TIME, RIGHT?

18:05.552 --> 18:06.886

IN MY APARTMENT?

18:19.266 --> 18:21.968

18:37.784 --> 18:39.952
I MEAN SHE'S REALLY SMART.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.822
- NOW, LET'S START
WITH THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM,

18:42.889 --> 18:45.057
A GROUND-BREAKING EQUATION,

18:45.192 --> 18:47.194
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS DISCOVERED
BY A BOY.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.061
[laughter]

18:49.196 --> 18:51.198
I MEAN, JUST BETWEEN US GIRLS,

18:51.264 --> 18:54.834
IT'S A KNOWN FACT BOYS
ARE NOT AS SMART AS GIRLS.

18:54.901 --> 18:55.835
[laughter]

18:55.902 --> 18:57.970
- EXCUSE ME.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.739
[clears throat]
[high-pitched] EXCUSE ME.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.008
UM, I DON'T THINK THAT'S
A, UH, VERY FAIR STATEMENT

19:02.074 --> 19:04.211
BECAUSE SOME BOYS
ARE VERY SMART.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.312
[laughter]

19:05.378 --> 19:06.879
- OH, PLEASE.
- THEY ARE.

19:06.946 --> 19:11.050
- I HAVE YET TO MEET ONE BOY
WHO FULLY UNDERSTANDS MY BOOK.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.085
- YEAH? WELL, UM, HMM,
THAT'S CRAZY
