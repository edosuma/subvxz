00:23.640 --> 00:24.920
Whoo!

00:24.960 --> 00:25.960
You OK?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.600
Ah, I just...
I just need a second.

00:27.640 --> 00:28.680
OK.

00:28.720 --> 00:33.280
Sorry, my Mum drives me insane
and you know, you've met her.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.280
Yeah. I have.
And she's a lot, but she's alright.

00:36.320 --> 00:39.080
Um, she's not,
and this is her home ground.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.200
So, she has home-ground advantage.
OK.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.360
Also, Lee
is the creepiest fucken man

00:43.400 --> 00:44.400
I've ever met.

00:44.440 --> 00:48.160
But you know,
whoo, thanks for doing this.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.640
I honestly can't face them alone.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.760
It'll be fine.
Parents are my speciality.

00:51.800 --> 00:52.800
Don't worry.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.280
Yeah, they won't be after tonight.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.880
Challenge accepted. I'm pumped.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.320
I fucken hate birthdays.
I know.

00:57.360 --> 00:58.640
OK, let's go.
Let's go.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.920
Alright, just breathe. It'll be OK.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.000
No. No, it won't.

01:32.200 --> 01:36.080
Happy birthday, my darling girl!
Hi, Mum!

01:36.120 --> 01:38.200
Oh!

01:38.240 --> 01:42.040
Oh, this is different, isn't it?
Checks! You're brave.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.080
Just the girls.
Hello.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.480
Just the girls, yeah.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.640
No, Lynelle just open...

01:45.680 --> 01:47.600
What are you doing, Mum?
..yourself to me a little bit.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.000
Can we just stand normally?
That's it.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.320
Act natural,
as though you've just met.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.800
That's it, and breathe.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.720
Excellent.

01:54.760 --> 01:55.960
Hello.
Anyway.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.600
Um, this is Gordon...
Another one. Another one.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.680
Just Ashley this time.
Oh.

01:58.720 --> 01:59.720
I'll just...
Sorry.

01:59.760 --> 02:00.000
..get the ISO in position.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.080
..get the ISO in position.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.640
The dream-like quality.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.800
That's it, just part your lips
a little bit more, Ashley.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.479
Terrific.
OK.

02:08.520 --> 02:09.840
Anymore? No? Good, alright.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.960
Anyway, so Gordon, this is Lee.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.240
Hello.
Lee, Gordon.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.880
Fantastic. Oh, OK.

02:14.920 --> 02:16.640
Hello.
I!

02:16.680 --> 02:18.480
You're taller than I remember,
aren't you?

02:18.520 --> 02:19.840
Oh, I'm wearing kitten heels.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.240
He's like a big strong oak tree,
isn't he, Lee?

02:23.280 --> 02:24.320
Mum.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.840
Oh, it's good
to see you again, Ms Steinhart.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.040
Just stop it. Call me Lynelle.
Lynelle.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.360
Ah, and hello, Professor.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.480
Oh, the famous Mr Colin.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.440
A-ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.440

02:38.480 --> 02:41.960
Welcome to our rhome.
Cripples are rost relcome.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.080
Ooh! He does tricks!

02:43.120 --> 02:44.480
Ah, he does.
Now, sit.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.840
Oh, you can't.

02:45.880 --> 02:49.760
Lee, stop it.
You're scaring the poor thing.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.200
Anyway, hello. I'm Gordon.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.120
Ahh! The boyfriend.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.160
Ah well, I mean...

02:54.200 --> 02:57.520
What are your intentions
with my daughter, young man?

02:57.560 --> 02:58.920
Not your daughter, Lee.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.000
No, yeah. I know.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.400
No, yeah. I know.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.480
Alright, everyone,

03:01.520 --> 03:03.040
let's move into the good room,
shall we?

03:03.080 --> 03:04.120
Ah, yeah.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.440
We've got hors d'oeuvres
and bubbles.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.120
Strap yourself in,
we're going to the good room.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.160
Shall I just...

03:10.200 --> 03:13.000
Not too many Cheds for you, Ashley.
You know, how your skin breaks out.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.160
Fucken hell.
Mm-hm.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.880
What's this?

03:24.200 --> 03:25.280
A voucher?

03:25.320 --> 03:28.040
It's a five-week cleanse.
It's called Me Foods.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.840
All organic and delivered right
to your door.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.000
Fiona's daughter lost 10kg.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.920
Can you believe that?

03:34.960 --> 03:36.360
Not really.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.400
Happy birthday, darling.

03:43.080 --> 03:45.320
The thermostat's on a timer, Ashley,

03:45.360 --> 03:48.120
so, if you're cold,
I've got jumpers.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.360
Oh, I'm fine, thanks, Lee.
Yeah.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.240
I'll probably be able to tell
when you're cold.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.000
So, um, Ashley says
that you're a professor, Lee.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.080
Is that right?
Mm.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.480
What do you profess?

03:59.520 --> 04:00.000
Well, Linguistics,

04:00.000 --> 04:01.520
Well, Linguistics,

04:01.560 --> 04:04.080
with a special interest
in Asian languages.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.280
Though recently I have fallen
in lust

04:07.320 --> 04:09.200
with another muse.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.080
Photography.
Ahh.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.840
The pen may be mightier
than the sword,

04:13.880 --> 04:15.360
but the camera shits on the lot.

04:16.480 --> 04:17.480
Wow.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.200
Oh, he's such
a dear little thing, isn't he?

04:20.240 --> 04:21.480
He's a cutie, isn't he?

04:21.519 --> 04:24.720
He won't wee on the rugs, will he?
We had them steamed last week.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.760
No, it's fine Mum. Thank...

04:26.800 --> 04:28.720
We need new rugs anyway,
don't we, Lee?

04:28.760 --> 04:29.960
These are revolting.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.960
Lee.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.160
Hang on.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.840
Ruffy-ruff-ruff-ruff.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.160
He's a sensual little creature,
isn't he?

04:43.320 --> 04:45.120
Sensual?
Mmm.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.280
Um...

04:47.320 --> 04:48.840
So...
Yes.

04:48.880 --> 04:52.080
Gordon.
Any medical issues in the family?

04:52.120 --> 04:53.960
Mum, come on!

04:54.000 --> 04:55.840
The boyfriend interrogation begins.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.360
No, he's not my...

04:57.400 --> 04:58.440
Well, we're not, yeah...

04:58.480 --> 05:00.000
Oh, I just assumed,
bringing him tonight...

05:00.000 --> 05:00.200
Oh, I just assumed,
bringing him tonight...

05:00.240 --> 05:01.240
No.
Well...

05:01.280 --> 05:02.280
We...we...
We're...

05:02.320 --> 05:03.400
We're keeping it to ourselves.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.480
Mm.
For now.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.080
Alright, suit yourselves.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.200
Yes, retain the mystery.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.120
The red velvet curtain.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.160
OK.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.800
Well, I should get back
to the kitchen.

05:14.840 --> 05:15.880
Where you belong.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.600
(LAUGHTER)

05:18.640 --> 05:21.160
Check on the roast.
I hope you're hungry, Gordon.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.360
Very. Love a roast.
Is it lamb, or...

05:23.400 --> 05:26.280
My specialty, gooducken.
Oh.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.280
Chicken, in duck, in goose.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.600
Wow.
Very tidy.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.480
But first, a toast.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.520
30 years ago,

05:38.560 --> 05:41.640
I was going
through the most intense pain

05:41.680 --> 05:43.960
I'd ever experienced in my life,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.960
and that includes
Ashley's teenage years.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.160
28 hours I was in labour.
Wow.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.240
28...

05:52.280 --> 05:53.320
28 hours.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.080
It was not 28 hours.
..of the most excruciating...

05:55.120 --> 05:58.360
I'm sorry, darling,
it was 28 hours and 49 minutes.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.000
Oh, I think
you add an hour every year.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.440
Oh, I think
you add an hour every year.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.440
You weren't there, darling.
Wasn't I?

06:02.480 --> 06:03.520
You know, what I mean.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.240
OK, What's your point, Mum?
Come on.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.440
Oh, they rip away
the best years of your life,

06:07.480 --> 06:09.000
but God forbid I talk about it.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.120
Did I? Did I rip them away?

06:11.160 --> 06:14.080
Anyway, it's... Yeah, God.
It's traumatic for both, you know.

06:14.120 --> 06:18.040
Being in labour, so hard
and I can imagine, in childbirth.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.160
You know, we've all been there.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.920
So...
Sure.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.440
They don't call it
the axe wound for nothing.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.520
Childbirth?

06:25.560 --> 06:26.920
The vulva.

06:26.960 --> 06:31.120
Anyway, I just wanted to say,

06:31.160 --> 06:34.520
happy 30th birthday, my big girl.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.840
And to Gordon,

06:35.880 --> 06:38.920
it's wonderful for Ashley
to have a mature man for a change,

06:38.960 --> 06:41.320
whether you're together,
or keeping it to yourselves,

06:41.360 --> 06:43.240
whatever it is.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.720
To the happy couple.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.160
Happy birthday, Ash.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.520
Probably that, yeah.

06:47.560 --> 06:48.680
Cheers.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.600
Oh, and I'd also like
to raise a little glass

06:50.640 --> 06:54.440
if nobody minds,
to a very special person

06:54.480 --> 06:56.680
whose birthday is also today.

06:56.720 --> 06:57.760
Oh.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.000
My Goppa,
Ashley's great-grandfather,

07:00.000 --> 07:00.600
My Goppa,
Ashley's great-grandfather,

07:00.640 --> 07:03.960
who would have turned 111 today.

07:05.240 --> 07:06.760
Miss you every day, Goppa.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.120
But he wouldn't have turned
111 today

07:11.160 --> 07:13.480
unless he was one
of the oldest people on the planet.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.360
Ashley.
No, it's fine.

07:15.400 --> 07:18.440
Like toast him, but don't say
that he would have turned 111 today

07:18.480 --> 07:20.680
like he was taken away from us
too soon or something.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.560
Like that's just not true.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.360
Like there's no version of reality

07:24.400 --> 07:27.560
where he would have turned
111 today.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.120
Goppa.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.760
No, not Goppa. No, sorry.
She does this every year.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.480
He died in his 70s,
like before I was born.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.960
There's just no way
it's still sad, Mum.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.840
This is my birthday,
and I'm still here.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.160
It's alright, Gordon.
She's still young.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.800
People of our generation
understand the fragility of life.

07:48.840 --> 07:49.840
Oh, for fuck's sake.

07:49.880 --> 07:50.960
Can I help you
in the kitchen, Lynelle?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
No...
Oh, lovely!

07:52.040 --> 07:53.920
Right.
No, you stay there, darling.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.160
Lee's been dying to talk to you.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.480
Is that a pant-suit?

08:04.600 --> 08:07.200
Aren't you thoughtful,
bringing beer?

08:07.240 --> 08:08.280
Oh, it's just a little,

08:08.320 --> 08:10.480
you know, hand-picked selection
from the microbrewery.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.640
A bit of something for everyone.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.400
Are you a lager girl or...

08:13.440 --> 08:14.440
Me?
Mm.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.240
No, I'm more
of a dry Chenin Blanc girl.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.480
Oh, OK. Alright.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.640
Well, I might actually have a zippy
little scrumpy in there

08:21.680 --> 08:22.920
that you might like.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.560
Maybe.
Yeah.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.560
Oh, wow.
Oh!

08:26.600 --> 08:28.520
Wow.
They're all my babies.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.800
Can't choose a favourite.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.960
But this one here, Helen,
she's been with me the longest.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.600
Likes the finer things in life,
like her Mum.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.280
Wow. That's amazing.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.120
And are they...
All of them are girls?

08:41.159 --> 08:42.640
Always wanted a girl.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.880
Lee and I dream of flying to Uganda

08:45.920 --> 08:46.960
and meeting them all.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.080
My daughters.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.520
You should come with us!

08:51.560 --> 08:52.560
To Uganda?

08:52.600 --> 08:54.280
Lee and I bought a goat
for the village

08:54.320 --> 08:55.360
for Ashley's birthday.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.640
Oh, I've heard of that.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.280
You could buy two chickens
in Ashley's name if you like.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.000
Yeah.
Or a duck.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.800
Yeah.
Or a duck.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.040
Ducks are only $30.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.160
Do they do geese?

09:03.200 --> 09:04.760
We could send tonight's dinner.
Package deal.

09:07.760 --> 09:08.840
All my babies.

09:13.840 --> 09:14.960
Well, this is nice.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.960
I like your buttons.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.200
My...
You know.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.280
Oh. Thank, thanks.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.160
Mm, what colour are they?
Is it fleshy?

09:26.200 --> 09:29.120
Ah, not noticed them before.
I would say that's pink.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.720
Pink. Pinky bits.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.520
Yeah.

09:33.560 --> 09:34.680
How are they attached?

09:37.960 --> 09:39.040
Cotton.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.680
Oh, that's new. Oh.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.160
You're only... Did you make that?

09:48.200 --> 09:49.640
Ah, yes, I crafted that.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.840
That is my mantra.

09:52.880 --> 09:55.040
You know, the key
to a strong relationship

09:55.080 --> 09:59.360
like your mother's and mine,
is open and honest communication.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.000
No, secrets.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.200
No, secrets.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.240
That's the secret.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.720
Definitely, yeah.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.040
Yes.
Yeah.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.040
Yes, you just tell it all
and you hide nothing.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.880
Love that.

10:09.920 --> 10:13.200
That's why I come across
as an open book.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.160
Because I am.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.480
Yeah.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.960
Hey, I think maybe enough photos
for today?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.160
No, I quite agree.
OK.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.560
Ohh.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.240
What's this?

10:29.280 --> 10:30.480
Observe.

10:37.880 --> 10:41.560
This allows me to change the film

10:41.600 --> 10:43.200
in complete darkness.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.040
Oh, cool.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.760
So, as not to compromise
the integrity of the roll.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.000
Takes some practice...

10:54.080 --> 10:56.200
but the rewards are manifold.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.240
Mm-hm.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.000
Ooh, there it is.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.960
Put it in there.
Mm-hm.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.480
Very good.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.680
Is that horse reiki?

11:37.720 --> 11:40.280
Mm... I work with rescue horses.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.440
I feel such a kinship with them.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.960
Wow.
Do you follow the horses at all?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.160
Horse-racing?

11:47.200 --> 11:49.120
It should be banned.
Yeah.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.400
I mean, I...I...

11:51.440 --> 11:53.120
Oh, that's a lovely shot.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.480
Isn't she beautiful?

11:55.520 --> 11:59.320
Such a gorgeous girl.
I'm so incredibly proud of Ashley.

11:59.360 --> 12:00.000
Oh, Lynelle.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.560
Oh, Lynelle.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.760
Not that I'd ever tell her that.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.320
Don't want her
getting a big fat head.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.200
Did she ever tell you

12:06.240 --> 12:07.600
what happened with James,
in the end?

12:07.640 --> 12:10.280
She never tells me anything.
No.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.960
I mean, I didn't ask,
but you could ask her.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.080
Could you encourage her
to exercise more?

12:16.120 --> 12:17.320
She won't listen to me.
Oh.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.720
She had her bum
from her father's side.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.800
It'll blow up if she's not careful.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.600
You don't want her having
a big fat wobbly bottom.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.360
I had the most wonderful dream
last night.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.360
Oh, yes, please.

12:30.400 --> 12:34.600
I was sitting in the room
of this house.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.120
It was a carpeted room

12:36.160 --> 12:38.960
and I was
with these two gorgeous women.

12:40.120 --> 12:43.960
And they had flowing blonde hair

12:44.000 --> 12:47.760
and I think one was my girlfriend.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.960
And the other, her twin sister.
Hm.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.560
And we were just enjoying
each other's company,

12:52.600 --> 12:55.440
and it was so natural.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.440
Suddenly, I felt the carpet
was just lifting up,

12:58.480 --> 13:00.000
just rising up.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.440
just rising up.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.360
It was then I realised
it was a magic carpet as well,

13:03.400 --> 13:06.080
and it just kept rising and rising,

13:06.120 --> 13:08.480
and the girls way down below.

13:08.520 --> 13:13.040
And I got to the roof,
and the carpet was just pressing

13:13.080 --> 13:15.480
and pressing me into the roof.

13:15.520 --> 13:20.200
And the girls were just scratching
the underside of the carpet,

13:20.240 --> 13:23.640
and...and the pressure was building,

13:23.680 --> 13:26.880
and building
and...and then I woke up.

13:28.680 --> 13:32.040
And I just felt so relaxed

13:32.080 --> 13:34.240
but also sad
that those women weren't real.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.400
So, it was a wet dream, yeah?

13:38.440 --> 13:40.480
Right, the vegies
need a few more minutes,

13:40.520 --> 13:42.400
so, it's time for the video!

13:42.440 --> 13:44.120
No, no Mum, not the video.

13:44.160 --> 13:47.080
Oh, come on, darling,
Gordon hasn't seen it.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.280
You're in for a treat.
Ashley, give him a hand.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.040
Oh, not in front of everyone,
I hope.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.240
Jacob Murray.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.440
He was so much better than you.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.320
Yeah. Yeah.
Nuh, we can all see that, Mum.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.960
Could have gone professional,

14:15.000 --> 14:16.760
but he looks after his mother,
Trish.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.360
Early onset Parkinson's.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.680
Oh.
So, sad.

14:19.720 --> 14:20.800
Sad.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.440
Gay, of course.

14:22.480 --> 14:23.960
Here it comes.

14:26.320 --> 14:29.240
Oh!
(LAUGHTER)

14:29.280 --> 14:31.040
I know, what that face means!

14:31.080 --> 14:35.120
Yes, because you've watched it
8,000 times, Mum!

14:36.240 --> 14:37.280
I'm gonna feed the dog.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.160
Oh, come on, Ashley. Lighten up!

14:40.200 --> 14:41.440
Oh, look at her, Gordon.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.480
Look at that chubby little
pudding face!

14:44.520 --> 14:45.880
Oh!

14:45.920 --> 14:47.120
There'll be tears!

14:47.160 --> 14:48.560
Ooh, vegies are ready.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.560
Oh, I might wash
my hands before dinner.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.720
Someone was raised well.
That's right.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.160
Lee! What are you doing?

15:15.680 --> 15:17.440
Big breaths, you're OK.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.600
I'm not. I can't.

15:18.640 --> 15:19.880
You are. You can.

15:19.920 --> 15:20.960
Uh-uh.
Yes...

15:21.000 --> 15:22.880
I told you this was gonna be fucked.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.760
I know, and I didn't believe you
and now I'm getting it.

15:25.800 --> 15:29.000
She's supposed to be my Mum.
Do you think she even likes me?

15:29.040 --> 15:30.200
She actually loves you.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.600
I don't think she loves anyone.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.680
Look, she is a particular lady, yes.

15:35.720 --> 15:36.960
Do you know
that I had to sit in there

15:37.000 --> 15:38.800
with that fucking serial killer

15:38.840 --> 15:41.840
while he described
his wet dream to me?

15:41.880 --> 15:43.640
He fucken what?
Yes! I can't.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.280
I can't.
OK. OK, OK, OK.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.720
But the good news is, alright,
we've done the video,

15:47.760 --> 15:50.160
we've done the good room,
we've done the weird fucken toasts.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.200
Yes, we have.
Right?

15:51.240 --> 15:53.000
And as fucked up
as gooducken sounds.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.720
It smells delicious. OK?

15:54.760 --> 15:57.080
So, all that we have to do now
is get drunk.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.520
I'm driving.
OK.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.000
So, eat all the birds,
and we get out of here.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.880
So, eat all the birds,
and we get out of here.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.040
Easy.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.080
OK.
OK?

16:03.120 --> 16:04.440
OK. OK.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.440
Where...

16:06.480 --> 16:08.480
It's vodka. For sweat stains.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.640
Hit me.
Yep.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.480
Oh, no, no.
Mm.

16:13.480 --> 16:14.480
Really?
Yeah.

16:14.520 --> 16:15.600
Thanks, coach.
Alright.

16:23.840 --> 16:24.960
Let's do it.
Yeah.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.080
We've got this. We've got this!

16:26.120 --> 16:28.960
Well, we don't, but you know,
your optimism is adorable.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.240
This is supposed to be stout, is it?

16:38.280 --> 16:40.400
That is stout, yeah.
And what's this supposed to be?

16:40.440 --> 16:41.520
That's double IPA.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.920
Oh, that's, very hipster.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.640
And what's...what does IPA mean?

16:47.680 --> 16:48.960
India Pale Ale.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.880
And what's double about it?

16:50.920 --> 16:53.440
Ah, it's very, very hoppy.
It's quite bitter.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.720
Yeah, it's not for everyone,
but you might like it.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.520
Well. Bottoms up.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.640
Oh.
Oh, Lee!

17:03.680 --> 17:05.599
I was just...just testing.
Sampling it.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.360
It's the way you do it
with the wine.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.760
Not back into the glass! Honestly!

17:09.800 --> 17:11.599
It's fine, it's OK. No, worries.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.599
Might have some red.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.800
Right, so neither of you
are going to have the beer?

17:15.839 --> 17:17.480
You know, Gordon made that himself.
It's OK.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.839
Well, I don't drink beer, darling.
Sorry.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.400
NO, no, no,
it's totally, totally fine.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.599
No...No, ah, yeah.
Mm!

17:23.640 --> 17:25.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no pressure.
So, you were saying, Lee?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
What's that?

17:27.040 --> 17:29.640
You were saying before about...
Oh, yes. Right.

17:29.680 --> 17:33.680
No, it's just such a wonderful
social instrument, Snapchat.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.440
Opened up a whole community
of people

17:36.480 --> 17:39.800
I would otherwise
never have had access to.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.200
Like who?

17:41.240 --> 17:44.400
Oh, international friends.

17:44.440 --> 17:45.520
We stay in touch.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.920
People of all ages.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.280
All colours.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.920
Creeds.
Mm, and it's so ephemeral, you know?

17:54.960 --> 17:57.400
You just send your message,
they read it,

17:57.440 --> 17:59.320
and then it disappears.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.000
It's the closest thing
to actual conversation online,

18:00.000 --> 18:02.680
It's the closest thing
to actual conversation online,

18:02.720 --> 18:06.800
without all those websites
owning your words and your photos

18:06.840 --> 18:08.200
and taking them out of context.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.960
But you do know that
when you get a Snapchat,

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
you can record it.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.880
No, no, no.
No, they're gone after ten seconds.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.720
Yeah, but you can screenshot them.

18:20.880 --> 18:21.920
What's that?

18:21.960 --> 18:24.480
You can screenshot them,
and then they can be circulated.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.640
Well, I...Ah, well...

18:30.680 --> 18:32.920
Ah, there...there you go.

18:32.960 --> 18:36.640
Oh, I've had enough
of this chatsnap rubbish.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.680
A toast.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.520
Mum, enough with the toasts.
My gosh.

18:40.560 --> 18:41.600
I thought it might be nice

18:41.640 --> 18:43.600
to spare a thought
for dear Alejandro.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.120
Mum, what are you doing?

18:48.160 --> 18:50.320
Might just pop to the loo
for a widdle.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.480
What? It's eight years today.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.480
Have I said the wrong thing?

18:55.520 --> 18:57.880
Why would you?
Sorry, I...I'm not um...

18:57.920 --> 19:00.000
I'm sorry, Gordon,
I thought you knew about Alejandro.

19:00.000 --> 19:00.800
I'm sorry, Gordon,
I thought you knew about Alejandro.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.960
No, I...Should I?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.600
No. No. No, it's not, um...

19:04.640 --> 19:07.760
A boy who died
at Ashley's birthday party.

19:07.800 --> 19:08.840
Drowned.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.880
Oh, I'm really sorry, Ash.

19:11.920 --> 19:12.960
He's not a boy.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.080
It was a group tour thing
in Barcelona

19:17.120 --> 19:18.560
and um...

19:18.600 --> 19:20.600
Oh!

19:20.640 --> 19:24.000
Why the fuck
would you bring this up?

19:24.040 --> 19:26.120
Well, today is the day
he passed away.

19:26.160 --> 19:29.560
I thought we should commemorate him.
You die twice, you know.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.240
Once in the physical sense,

19:31.280 --> 19:33.440
and once again when people stop
saying your name.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.480
Well, I won't. Alejandro.

19:35.520 --> 19:38.440
Yeah, I'm sure that he has
plenty of family and friends

19:38.480 --> 19:39.760
that say his name.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.520
I'm sorry, darling.
I didn't mean to upset you.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.080
I was just thinking about him.
I'm an empath.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.360
I feel things very deeply.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.600
Oh, do you? Do you, Mum?

19:49.640 --> 19:52.680
Do you feel
that there's anything wrong

19:52.720 --> 19:54.000
with your fucken boyfriend?

19:54.040 --> 19:55.080
Ashley!

19:55.120 --> 19:57.800
Oh, I'm sorry,
do you not want to talk about that?

19:57.840 --> 20:00.000
He is so inappropriate.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.440
He is so inappropriate.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.640
Oh, he's joking.
Now, you listen to me.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.920
Lee is very good to me,

20:04.960 --> 20:07.280
and after what I put up
with from your father,

20:07.320 --> 20:11.160
I deserve that.
After what you put up with?

20:11.200 --> 20:14.080
He finally realised
that you're batshit crazy,

20:14.120 --> 20:15.160
and he left you.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.800
That's enough.
No, it's not.

20:16.840 --> 20:20.800
And you have been poking me
all night.

20:20.840 --> 20:24.520
The constant digs,
the obsession with my weight.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.640
I mean, look at the food portion
I got given.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.120
I mean, that's ridiculous.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.560
You can help yourself
if you must have more.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.880
And then to bring up Alejandro?

20:34.080 --> 20:35.200
Why did you do that?

20:37.600 --> 20:38.640
Why?

20:38.680 --> 20:39.920
I mean, you're supposed
to be my Mum,

20:39.960 --> 20:42.560
and you know, you're supposed
to just love me.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.200
I do love you!

20:44.240 --> 20:45.400
And that's how you show it?

20:45.440 --> 20:47.480
Just humiliating me
in front of my boyfriend?

20:48.760 --> 20:49.800
It's so fucked up!

20:49.840 --> 20:51.680
Oh, no, quick, quick,
he's doing a wee.

20:51.720 --> 20:52.880
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.040
Is that on the Monterey Oak?

20:54.080 --> 20:56.840
Oh, fuck off, Lee, ya creep!

20:56.880 --> 20:58.480
I think she might be
a bit overwhelmed.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.560
It's OK.
OK.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.000
It's OK.
It's OK, Colly.

21:00.000 --> 21:00.600
It's OK.
It's OK, Colly.

21:00.640 --> 21:01.680
Sorry about that.
You alright?

21:01.720 --> 21:02.720
He's...he's OK.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.160
No, I'm so sorry.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.720
I have to leave.
I'm gonna sit in the car.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.480
Ashley, sit back down.
You're ruining everything.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.240
No. No. I'm out.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.680
Come on, Colly, we're going.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.480
Well...

21:21.840 --> 21:23.160
Well, I'm not letting this get cold.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.840
Three birds in one.

21:26.880 --> 21:27.960
Lucky me.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.000
Hope you can handle
that temper, Gordon.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.280
I never could.
Comes from her father.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.880
Imagine living in a house
with the two of them.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.760
Don't know, how I did it.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.840
Hey, should... I should probably...

21:39.880 --> 21:41.600
Oh, no, don't be silly.
No!

21:41.640 --> 21:44.320
Oh, no, she'll be back
in a few minutes.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.760
She always does this
on her birthday.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.000
It's a vicious circle, you know?

21:50.040 --> 21:51.040
I told her,

21:51.080 --> 21:52.720
you keep scowling
your way through life,

21:52.760 --> 21:55.120
you're going to look like an angrily
little Miss permanently.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.680
Her face is going that way.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.040
Noticed that.
Dreadful.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.960
Why did you bring up
that boy, Lynelle?

22:09.360 --> 22:10.560
It happened on her birthday.

22:10.600 --> 22:13.880
I thought it might be nice
to have a little toast to him.

22:13.920 --> 22:14.960
Did you?

22:16.320 --> 22:18.320
I'm sorry, but I do feel things,

22:18.360 --> 22:21.840
and I think that life is too short
not to say what's in your heart.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.120
Except for what you said to me
about being proud of Ashley.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.600
You said you didn't want
to say that.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.200
Oh, she knows I'm proud of her!

22:27.240 --> 22:29.080
She got into medicine.
Of course, I'm proud of her...

22:29.120 --> 22:30.720
Lynelle, I completely...
I completely understand

22:30.760 --> 22:32.800
showing me
the embarrassing home videos

22:32.840 --> 22:35.720
and making jokes
about how hard labour was

22:35.760 --> 22:37.680
and you know,
I get all that, completely.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.240
But you don't...
you never balance it out.

22:40.280 --> 22:41.280
At all.

22:41.320 --> 22:44.000
I mean, apart from what you said
privately to me in the kitchen,

22:44.040 --> 22:47.000
I haven't heard a single
positive thing about Ashley,

22:47.040 --> 22:50.080
or to Ashley, the entire night.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.200
Do you realise that?

22:54.520 --> 22:56.040
Well, you're very sweet for caring.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.000
But I'm her mother,
and no matter how upset she gets,

23:00.000 --> 23:00.680
But I'm her mother,
and no matter how upset she gets,

23:00.720 --> 23:01.800
she knows I love her.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.560
I don't think she does.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.160
Well, I think
I might know her better.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.720
Yeah, look, I...I don't know

23:10.760 --> 23:12.480
what the story
is with the Spanish boy.

23:12.520 --> 23:14.880
Argentinian.
Those very festive people.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.400
They were in Barcelona,
in a nightclub.

23:16.440 --> 23:17.680
Yeah, I don't need
to know the story.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.080
That's not important,
what's important is

23:19.120 --> 23:22.080
it's clearly upsetting
for Ash to talk about.

23:22.120 --> 23:24.120
But as an empath,
I'm sure you know that.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.400
I liked her last fella better.
Did you?

23:28.440 --> 23:30.200
Hey, why don't you catch up
with him on Snapchat?

23:30.240 --> 23:31.320
I'm really sorry about tonight.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.520
I...I struggled with it,

23:32.560 --> 23:35.800
as a veteran people pleaser,
but yeah, that's... so, sorry.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.000
Yeah, that's OK.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.160
I'm sure we can give all of this

23:39.200 --> 23:41.920
to the homeless people
at the soup kitchen.

23:43.520 --> 23:44.960
Yeah. That's... Yeah.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.720
He had a ratty face.

23:48.760 --> 23:49.880
Thank you, darling.

23:54.720 --> 23:58.960
We were all going out
for my 22nd birthday.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
We went out
to this Eurotrash nightclub

24:00.000 --> 24:01.720
We went out
to this Eurotrash nightclub

24:01.760 --> 24:03.000
with a pool on the roof,

24:03.040 --> 24:05.280
and um, I was...

24:06.840 --> 24:10.040
I got drunk,
but I was supposed to be in charge.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.200
And Alejandro, he...

24:15.000 --> 24:17.280
he was just the sweetest guy,

24:17.320 --> 24:20.200
but he was on pills or something,

24:20.240 --> 24:24.200
and he was in the water...

24:26.920 --> 24:28.280
and I looked over and I could see

24:28.320 --> 24:32.000
that he was...he was pretty wasted,
but he was...he was OK.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.800
And then when I looked back,
he was just not there.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.520
He'd gone under the water,
but I think nobody saw it.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.320
And by the time I went over there
he was unconscious and...

24:49.680 --> 24:51.480
and we pulled him out of the water,

24:51.520 --> 24:54.840
but nobody knew CPR
and everyone's staring at me.

24:54.880 --> 24:56.120
You know, I'm the one in charge.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.560
I'm the one
who's supposed to know CPR,

24:58.600 --> 25:00.000
but I...I just didn't.

25:00.040 --> 25:04.520
I'd done some,
like, bullshit training

25:04.560 --> 25:07.920
ages ago
that I barely paid attention to,

25:07.960 --> 25:10.200
and I'm...

25:10.240 --> 25:11.640
I'm like pumping away at his chest

25:11.680 --> 25:13.400
and I'm trying to remember
what to do.

25:17.160 --> 25:19.080
But it just wasn't working and...

25:23.080 --> 25:24.320
And so he died.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.600
Ash, you were a kid.

25:31.640 --> 25:35.240
I know,
but it should not have happened.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.360
You were 22.
Yeah.

25:38.400 --> 25:39.600
It was an accident.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.960
It fucked me up so badly
for such a long time.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.760
Ash, I'm so sorry.

25:53.280 --> 25:57.800
You know, I don't think
I've ever told that story before,

25:57.840 --> 25:59.880
to someone I'm seeing.

25:59.920 --> 26:00.000
Someone you're seeing?
Yeah.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.240
Someone you're seeing?
Yeah.

26:02.280 --> 26:03.800
In there you said
I was your boyfriend.

26:05.640 --> 26:07.040
What the fuck.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.480
Did I say that?
Yes, you did.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.000
Well, you know,

26:11.040 --> 26:13.160
that might have been
for dramatic effect.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.920
Well, you're right.
I mean, I'm not your boyfriend.

26:16.320 --> 26:18.560
No?
No.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.600
I'm more of a manfriend.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.400
Manfriend's great.
I've never had a manfriend.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.600
You got one now.

26:24.640 --> 26:27.560
I mean, it sounds a little sinister.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.400
Yeah, I can be a little sinister.

26:30.480 --> 26:31.960
That's true.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.440
But I can also listen to anything
that you wanna tell me.

26:34.480 --> 26:35.880
Like anything.

26:39.720 --> 26:40.800
Thank you.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.280
So, tonight really sucked.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.640
Like exactly how I said it would.

26:50.680 --> 26:52.920
I will never doubt you again.
Yeah, don't.

26:52.960 --> 26:57.920
But um, seeing as you
were so good tonight...

26:59.760 --> 27:00.000
Do you want to be
my manfriend at um,

27:00.000 --> 27:03.160
Do you want to be
my manfriend at um,

27:03.200 --> 27:05.120
my birthday drinks this weekend?

27:06.640 --> 27:08.040
Wow. So, I passed the audition?

27:08.080 --> 27:10.400
You've passed the first round.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.240
Oh, OK.
There is so...

27:12.280 --> 27:13.960
And that's the easy round.
Oh, really?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.160
Yeah, my friends
are fucking animals.

27:18.160 --> 27:21.160
