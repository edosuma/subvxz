WEBVTT

00:01.530 --> 00:04.330
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:04.430 --> 00:07.890
"The Sangraal shall instead belong to he
who speaks the Guardian's name."

00:08.000 --> 00:12.600
They say that the Sangraal is protected
by the most powerful of magical beasts.

00:12.710 --> 00:15.070
Amongst the information I obtained
regarding the Sangraal

00:15.180 --> 00:16.370
is the name of the protector.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.950
- Protector?
- The dragon.

00:18.050 --> 00:21.170
OSRIC: The Sangraal is hidden in a cave
beneath a lone mountain.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.380
It's too bad you won't be coming with us.

00:28.060 --> 00:30.580
There it is. We've found it.

00:31.690 --> 00:34.750
Well, I guess I'm not as true of spirit
as you thought I was.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.490
Hey!

00:36.600 --> 00:38.730
We agreed there's no such thing
as a dragon, right?

00:38.830 --> 00:39.890
Yeah.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.000
VALA: Because that looks
pretty real to me.

00:55.550 --> 00:56.610
What just happened?

00:56.720 --> 00:58.950
I extended my protective shield.

00:59.050 --> 01:00.990
You're lucky I still need you.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.880
Whoa, heads up!

01:13.470 --> 01:14.730
Move out!

01:18.440 --> 01:19.930
(DRAGON SCREECHING)

01:26.510 --> 01:27.670
(SIGHING)

01:27.780 --> 01:30.010
Well, he's too big to fit
through the opening,

01:30.120 --> 01:31.950
so I think we're safe.

01:32.490 --> 01:33.850
(DRAGON ROARING)

01:34.520 --> 01:35.960
(DRAGON SCREECHING)

01:39.290 --> 01:40.850
Move!

01:58.150 --> 02:00.740
There appears to be an exit this way.

02:04.520 --> 02:07.750
Okay, what the hell
just happened back there?

02:07.860 --> 02:10.590
It was a hologram.
The Sangraal wasn't real.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.630
What are you saying?
We came all this way for nothing?

02:12.730 --> 02:14.960
- We have to go back inside.
- BA'AL: You must be joking.

02:15.060 --> 02:16.550
The dragon is the final test.

02:16.660 --> 02:19.530
It would be madness
to challenge that thing.

02:30.450 --> 02:33.350
I don't think we're going to have a choice.

03:41.220 --> 03:42.410
(DRAGON SCREECHING)

03:46.860 --> 03:48.190
Tree line!

04:08.140 --> 04:09.970
So now what?

04:10.680 --> 04:12.740
It can't see us
as long as we stay in the trees.

04:12.850 --> 04:14.610
We should be able
to make it back to the village.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.450
We're not going anywhere.

04:16.550 --> 04:20.390
Adria's right. The dragon's the final test,
and we've come too far to give up now.

04:20.490 --> 04:24.220
It's just that kind of noble sentiment
that's going to get us all killed.

04:24.330 --> 04:28.320
Aren't you the one that claimed
to know the dragon's secret name?

04:28.430 --> 04:29.950
Time to earn your keep.

04:30.060 --> 04:33.590
Yes, I may have exaggerated
about that slightly.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.790
Anyway, you didn't think
that just by calling out its name

04:35.900 --> 04:37.800
you'd suddenly be able to control it?

04:37.910 --> 04:40.200
I don't know. Name magic is common
in most mythologies.

04:40.310 --> 04:43.140
To know something's secret name
is to steal its power.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.410
So, what are we supposed to do?
Just start guessing?

04:45.510 --> 04:47.500
Darrell, the dragon.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.710
MITCHELL: How about Smokey?

04:48.820 --> 04:49.940
Perhaps Puff.

04:50.050 --> 04:51.640
Would you just give me a minute?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.080
(DRAGON SCREECHING)

04:57.390 --> 04:59.090
While we're waiting, options?

04:59.190 --> 05:01.790
Well, we know the P90 fire
just bounced off its armor.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.520
Which means it's not a hologram.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.660
If it was a hologram, the bullets
would've gone straight through.

05:05.770 --> 05:07.460
So it's not that your weapons
aren't ineffective,

05:07.570 --> 05:09.200
it's that they're ineffective
in a different way.

05:09.300 --> 05:12.240
What I am saying is that if bullets bounce,

05:12.340 --> 05:14.810
maybe we should try something
that packs a little more punch.

05:20.980 --> 05:24.210
All right, here is what we're going to do.

05:25.150 --> 05:29.250
We're going to lure Darrell
down to the ground.

05:29.790 --> 05:31.730
I'm going to take this thing,

05:31.830 --> 05:37.420
and we're going to toss it underneath and
detonate it near the exposed underbelly.

05:37.530 --> 05:40.090
That's where dragons are most vulnerable.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Carter, you detonate from the tree line,

05:46.110 --> 05:48.470
and I will do the running.

05:52.350 --> 05:55.180
That's all right, Teal'c. I got this one.

05:58.250 --> 05:59.580
All right.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.090
Off you go.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.120
(DRAGON SCREECHING)

06:44.800 --> 06:47.320
- Oh, son of a bitch.
- Oh, not good.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.590
Teal'c, run!

06:56.640 --> 06:58.810
Hey, Daniel,
now would be a really good time.

06:58.910 --> 06:59.970
Okay, the <i>Parchment of Virtues</i> said

07:00.080 --> 07:02.020
the Sangraal would belong
to he who speaks the guardian's name.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.180
- The guardian's name...
- The guardian is a dragon.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.250
No, the guardian's not the dragon.

07:05.350 --> 07:06.790
The guardian is the person
who set this whole thing up.

07:06.890 --> 07:09.250
- The guardian is Morgan Le Fay.
- Right!

07:11.060 --> 07:12.820
Wait! No!

07:13.360 --> 07:14.390
What the hell?

07:14.500 --> 07:15.550
Wait!

07:20.070 --> 07:23.940
Hey! Morgan Le Fay!

07:26.970 --> 07:28.740
(SCREECHING)

07:29.240 --> 07:30.230
Darrell?

07:30.350 --> 07:31.810
Ganos Lal!

07:39.890 --> 07:40.950
Wow.

07:42.820 --> 07:46.280
It's Morgan's name in Ancient.

07:46.390 --> 07:48.190
Yeah, I know.

07:51.970 --> 07:53.830
Thanks for the assist.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.740
Well, to be honest,
I wouldn't have been of much use to you.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.700
My strengths
lie in strategy and command,

07:58.810 --> 08:01.830
whereas yours lie
in armed combat and dealing with...

08:01.940 --> 08:03.210
Dragons?

08:04.080 --> 08:05.270
Clearly.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.290
It's real this time, right?

08:14.390 --> 08:16.190
I don't see why not.

08:19.430 --> 08:21.260
Oh, come on.

08:30.740 --> 08:33.500
Okay, what just happened?

08:34.480 --> 08:37.340
CARTER: I think we were transported
into another chamber.

08:37.450 --> 08:38.940
Where's Adria?

08:40.310 --> 08:42.370
I guess she didn't make it.

08:44.050 --> 08:46.920
It must be some sort of security measure.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.580
I don't know.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.810
It let him in.

08:51.860 --> 08:54.260
Well, I don't think Morgan
was too concerned about the Goa'uld.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.960
It was the Ori she was worried about.

08:58.770 --> 09:00.320
MITCHELL: You know,
I'm not seeing anything

09:00.440 --> 09:03.200
around here that looks like a Sangraal,

09:03.870 --> 09:07.270
which begets the question,
what was she protecting?

09:07.380 --> 09:08.900
I think I know.

09:23.490 --> 09:26.390
"Here lies Myrrdin,
Archmage of the Round."

09:31.100 --> 09:33.030
All right, that's not a hologram.

09:33.130 --> 09:35.970
- He's the real McCoy, right?
- I think so.

09:39.710 --> 09:41.970
MITCHELL: How long has he been in there?

09:42.810 --> 09:44.570
Well over a thousand years.

09:44.680 --> 09:48.380
TEAL'C: We have encountered Ancient
stasis technology such as this before.

09:48.480 --> 09:52.040
General O'Neill was kept in a similar pod
in Antarctica.

09:52.950 --> 09:56.980
So, how do we get him out?

09:59.330 --> 10:01.260
I have no idea.

10:01.360 --> 10:04.660
VALA: Hey, guys, look at this.

10:06.130 --> 10:07.830
Vala, be careful!

10:14.080 --> 10:15.270
I...

10:15.380 --> 10:16.670
(ENERGY SURGING)

10:19.150 --> 10:20.610
MITCHELL: Hey, Jackson!

10:24.020 --> 10:25.450
Jackson!

10:27.390 --> 10:28.980
Whoa, we got him.

10:29.090 --> 10:30.350
Clear that off.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.590
He's heavier than he looks.

10:42.270 --> 10:43.500
(GROANING)

10:47.740 --> 10:49.870
No, he did not just...

10:50.610 --> 10:52.550
No, he's still alive.

10:52.650 --> 10:55.080
It may take him a while
to revive completely.

10:55.180 --> 10:59.050
All right. In the meantime,
we should see if there's a way out of here.

10:59.650 --> 11:01.680
Let us know what you find.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.990
Or I could come, too.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.940
Hey, daylight over here.

11:29.420 --> 11:34.350
You know, I can't quite put my finger on it,
but something is different.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.150
We weren't just transported
to another chamber.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.820
We were transported to another planet.

11:39.260 --> 11:40.990
The gate must have been
activated remotely,

11:41.100 --> 11:44.500
then the obelisk beamed us
through the wormhole.

11:44.600 --> 11:48.130
Well, as far as I'm concerned, the more
distance between us and Adria, the better.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.330
Except that she has the knowledge
of the Ori.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.770
She knows as much about the gates and
the DHDs as the people who built them.

11:53.870 --> 11:57.000
- Lf anyone can track us, it's her.
- Yeah, except that.

12:02.550 --> 12:05.490
It's amazing how similar this is
to the myth.

12:06.220 --> 12:08.650
Supposedly, Morgan trapped Merlin
in a cave

12:08.760 --> 12:11.660
and left him frozen there for all eternity.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.750
Only in reality,
I think she was trying to protect him.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.390
How do you mean?

12:18.930 --> 12:24.700
Well, I'm starting to think that maybe
Morgan did destroy the Sangraal after all.

12:24.810 --> 12:26.170
I mean, she probably figured
she had no choice.

12:26.270 --> 12:30.330
That if she didn't do it, the other Ancients
would have just sent someone else.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.780
So instead, she did the next best thing.

12:32.880 --> 12:36.540
MITCHELL: She preserved the one man
capable of building it again.

12:36.650 --> 12:37.880
Well, it's official.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.980
We are stuck here, wherever "here" is.

12:41.090 --> 12:43.890
The good news is we found a gate.
Teal'c's watching it.

12:43.990 --> 12:45.720
- The bad news is...
- We can't dial out.

12:45.830 --> 12:47.590
Somebody tampered with the DHD.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.090
BA'AL: I can fix it.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.660
Reprogramming dialing devices
is my specialty.

12:54.600 --> 12:58.370
Whoops. Guess who's coming around.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.470
Where am I?

13:02.580 --> 13:04.070
Good question.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.810
You look familiar.

13:11.990 --> 13:13.150
Guinevere.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.980
Oh, my dear, it's been too long.

13:16.090 --> 13:18.180
It's good to see you, too.

13:18.290 --> 13:22.160
Percivale and Galahad.

13:22.260 --> 13:27.390
Oh, brave knights, fortune indeed does
smile upon me to see your faces again.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.440
It looks like Merlin's drawbridge no longer
goes all the way across the moat,

13:30.540 --> 13:31.940
if you catch my meaning.

13:32.040 --> 13:36.940
What's that? Mordred.
I might have known it.

13:37.040 --> 13:40.010
BA'AL: We're wasting our time
with this old fool.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.050
We need to get back to the gate,
so I can start reprogramming...

13:42.150 --> 13:43.580
Be silent.

13:48.390 --> 13:50.050
Well, how do you like that?

13:50.160 --> 13:52.520
The old boy still has some tricks
up his sleeve.

13:52.630 --> 13:55.220
Merlin. Myrrdin!

13:56.130 --> 14:00.120
We need you to remember
about the Sangraal,

14:00.230 --> 14:03.140
about Morgan,
and about how you got here.

14:03.770 --> 14:06.760
- Morgan...
- You also knew her as Ganos Lal.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.640
I haven't heard that name spoken
in a very long time.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.710
We're not Knights of the Round Table.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.010
MITCHELL: Though we are flattered
by the comparison.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.680
A thousand years have passed.
We know who you really are.

14:17.790 --> 14:21.190
We know about Atlantis
and we've encountered the Ori.

14:21.290 --> 14:22.780
Tell me more.

14:23.690 --> 14:25.820
I don't know where to begin.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.160
This is going to take a while.

14:31.870 --> 14:34.630
All right, we'll get started
checking out the cave.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.600
Unless you have any objections.

14:39.710 --> 14:41.500
No? Great. Move out.

14:46.780 --> 14:48.340
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

14:48.650 --> 14:50.510
Make way for the Orici!

14:54.560 --> 14:56.080
What happened?

14:56.190 --> 15:01.890
The gate activated on its own
and only seconds later, it closed again.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.990
I don't suppose anyone saw the address.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.400
No, Orici.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.090
I'll need to examine the dialing device.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.690
Ready your men.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.640
As soon as I determine where they went,
we're leaving.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.170
Yes, Orici.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.640
And what of the village?

15:16.740 --> 15:19.370
Have they agreed to accept
the teachings of Origin?

15:19.480 --> 15:20.470
No.

15:20.580 --> 15:21.810
Then burn it.

15:26.590 --> 15:30.080
And it was Morgan
who finally led us to you.

15:30.190 --> 15:32.660
Of course, she couldn't come right out
and tell us.

15:32.760 --> 15:36.060
She had to be annoyingly cryptic
about the whole thing.

15:36.160 --> 15:40.000
You have an unusual understanding
of the way of Ascended beings.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.360
Yes, that's partly
because I used to be one myself.

15:44.140 --> 15:47.540
The human race could not have progressed
that far in only a thousand years.

15:47.640 --> 15:51.580
No, I had a little help.
Her name was Oma Desala.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.170
Oh, of course.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.240
And what happened?

15:56.350 --> 16:00.120
Well, I guess I didn't exactly
see eye to eye with the others.

16:00.220 --> 16:04.090
Oh, yes.
I found myself in a similar position.

16:04.190 --> 16:07.650
Yeah, I wasn't too good
at the whole non-interference thing.

16:07.760 --> 16:11.030
I guess there were a few arguments.
At least, that's the impression I got.

16:11.130 --> 16:12.500
- You don't remember?
- No.

16:12.600 --> 16:17.440
In order to protect me, Oma erased it
all from my mind and sent me back.

16:17.540 --> 16:20.370
Oh, I'm surprised
she still hasn't learned her lesson.

16:20.470 --> 16:23.770
She's not the only one
who broke some of the rules.

16:23.880 --> 16:28.370
The Ori gain their power
from the lower planes,

16:28.480 --> 16:32.010
so much so that one day they shall be
strong enough to wipe the others out.

16:32.850 --> 16:38.490
In the face of such a threat, a strict policy
of non-interference is absurd.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.360
I'm sure Oma would agree with you.

16:40.460 --> 16:43.990
Oma concerns herself with the individual.

16:44.100 --> 16:48.360
She may have the best intentions, but
then, so did the Ori when they first began.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.070
Still,

16:53.270 --> 16:58.470
she must have seen something in you
to believe you to be worthy.

17:06.020 --> 17:10.080
This cave is a bust.
There's nothing else here.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.620
- How's it going?
- I'm not exactly sure.

17:21.940 --> 17:23.870
Before I agree to join with you,

17:23.970 --> 17:29.310
I need to know that you are willing to do
whatever must be done to see it through.

17:29.410 --> 17:33.970
Surely, you have some idea of
what we've been through to get here.

17:34.080 --> 17:39.280
What you experienced so far is
as nothing compared to what is to come.

17:43.690 --> 17:46.160
Don't worry about us. We're on board.

17:46.260 --> 17:49.090
In that case,
there is much work to be done.

18:17.490 --> 18:18.520
(SIGHING)

18:20.230 --> 18:24.360
He's been at it for hours, Daniel.
Want to take a guess at what he's doing?

18:24.470 --> 18:28.030
Well, from the looks of it, I'd say
he's virtually piecing something together

18:28.140 --> 18:29.900
from base molecules.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.260
Another Sangraal?

18:37.750 --> 18:38.800
(EX CLAIMING)

18:40.650 --> 18:43.980
Thank you. I'm fine. Just need a little rest.

18:50.090 --> 18:51.250
What was that?

18:51.360 --> 18:52.830
<i>TEAL 'C ON RADIO:</i>
<i>Colonels Mitchell and Carter.</i>

18:52.930 --> 18:55.120
<i>Come quickly. You will want to see this.</i>

18:59.900 --> 19:01.300
Let's go.

19:07.010 --> 19:09.070
The gate activated on its own.

19:09.180 --> 19:13.480
The crystal in the obelisk began to glow,
and then everything changed.

19:13.580 --> 19:14.840
I'll say.

19:15.820 --> 19:18.610
MITCHELL: We've been
transported to another planet.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.090
Well, if Daniel's right,
and Morgan wanted to keep Merlin hidden,

19:21.190 --> 19:23.420
this would be a great way to do it.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.990
My guess is we're traveling through
a circuit of planets

19:26.090 --> 19:27.360
cut off from the rest of the gate system

19:27.460 --> 19:29.730
by a deliberate alteration
of the DHD program.

19:29.830 --> 19:32.990
Then you believe we'll be unable
to dial out from this gate as well.

19:33.100 --> 19:36.630
Well, we can give it a shot,
but, yeah, I doubt it'll work

19:36.740 --> 19:39.370
until we find the automatic dialing
program in the DHD processor

19:39.470 --> 19:40.460
and shut it down.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.370
You can do that, right?

19:44.850 --> 19:46.280
I hope so.

19:55.420 --> 19:58.760
I have lived many lifetimes.

19:59.690 --> 20:03.150
First in Atlantis.

20:04.230 --> 20:09.760
Then on Earth before the dawn
of your civilization.

20:10.970 --> 20:14.530
Then I joined the ranks of the Ascended,

20:15.740 --> 20:22.580
and finally, I returned to mortal form
to live out my remaining days

20:22.950 --> 20:26.440
among the noblemen of Arthur's court,

20:27.390 --> 20:30.020
or so I thought.

20:30.120 --> 20:33.720
And through all these eons,

20:33.830 --> 20:37.590
only one thing stayed the same.

20:39.170 --> 20:41.260
There is never enough time.

20:43.970 --> 20:46.300
Well, we're safe for the moment.

20:46.410 --> 20:49.860
You can take all the time you need.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.670
I slept too long.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.810
My body betrays me.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.910
We're not about to let you give up now.

21:00.020 --> 21:02.010
You realize what's at stake.

21:02.120 --> 21:05.060
If you don't help us,
the Ori will take this galaxy.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.620
(SIGHING)

21:10.230 --> 21:14.130
One last task, then, before I rest.

21:36.690 --> 21:40.560
Good luck, Dr. Jackson.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.820
(ENERGY SURGING)

21:58.850 --> 21:59.870
(EX CLAIMING)

22:09.220 --> 22:10.920
What just happened?

22:12.390 --> 22:13.360
He's dead.

22:23.340 --> 22:25.670
He said, "Good luck"?

22:25.770 --> 22:27.430
It's very strange.

22:28.040 --> 22:32.030
It's almost as if he knew
it was going to happen.

22:32.750 --> 22:37.310
Which leaves us with no Sangraal, and
for the moment, no way off this planet.

22:37.420 --> 22:40.180
I told you I can fix the dialing device.

22:41.520 --> 22:46.120
Merlin's little trick with my vocal chords
expired at the same moment he did.

22:46.230 --> 22:48.520
Yet another reason to mourn his passing.

22:48.630 --> 22:53.120
Joke all you want, Teal'c, but I am
the only one who can get us out of here.

22:55.770 --> 23:01.110
He is good with dialing programs.
Maybe if we work together.

23:03.980 --> 23:06.340
I'm having trouble finding
the relocation program.

23:06.450 --> 23:08.910
It must be buried in one of
the correlative subroutines.

23:09.020 --> 23:11.480
We'll never find it
using those search protocols.

23:11.590 --> 23:14.080
I'm going to have to
make some adjustments to your program.

23:14.190 --> 23:16.160
How much longer is this going to take?

23:16.260 --> 23:17.850
It's impossible to say.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.590
All I know for sure is
it would have been a lot easier

23:19.690 --> 23:22.090
on that nice, warm desert planet.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.470
He said he had one more thing to do
before he could rest.

23:32.970 --> 23:36.100
I thought he meant
build us another weapon.

23:36.210 --> 23:40.010
No, you were right before.
He knew he didn't have enough time.

23:41.780 --> 23:45.150
Now, this is obviously
some sort of virtual interface,

23:45.250 --> 23:48.880
like a computer-assisted design program,
only in the past,

23:48.990 --> 23:51.980
we've seen it used to download
information into someone's mind.

23:52.090 --> 23:53.790
What sort of information?

23:53.890 --> 23:55.490
All the knowledge of the Ancients.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.560
That's a lot.

23:56.660 --> 24:00.390
Yes, as a matter of fact, it's too much
for a human brain to handle. It's fatal.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.870
But what if you could control it?

24:03.870 --> 24:06.770
Use it to store and load
something more specific?

24:06.870 --> 24:07.970
Like?

24:08.780 --> 24:10.270
I'm not sure.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.380
Hey!

24:23.490 --> 24:25.580
<i>(ON RADIO) Vala here.</i>
<i>I'm going to need some help.</i>

24:25.690 --> 24:27.750
- What is it?
<i>- It's Daniel.</i>

24:29.460 --> 24:30.950
- Keep working.
- Cam...

24:31.060 --> 24:33.930
I do not trust him
to finish on his own, Sam.

24:43.110 --> 24:44.410
Jackson!

24:46.380 --> 24:47.610
Jackson!

24:49.050 --> 24:50.570
What did he do?

24:54.150 --> 24:55.990
The planet is lifeless.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.510
There is no one here.

24:59.130 --> 25:01.890
They were here. I'm certain of it.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.190
What would you have us do?

25:05.000 --> 25:08.700
Lead the men in Prostration. I will inform
you when I have the next address.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.740
Yes, Orici.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.020
Try it now.

25:32.590 --> 25:34.960
I'm still not reading any anomalies.

25:35.060 --> 25:38.720
This is ridiculous.
I can't be expected to work like this.

25:38.830 --> 25:42.270
I can barely see, my fingers are numb.

25:42.370 --> 25:47.310
I say we go back inside, we warm up,
we take our chances on the next planet.

25:47.410 --> 25:48.700
How do you know it will not be worse?

25:53.010 --> 25:54.950
We're about to find out.

26:01.390 --> 26:05.190
(EX CLAIMING) Merlin's gone.

26:09.630 --> 26:12.930
Well, that's just weird.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.130
Sam, what just happened?

26:14.940 --> 26:17.270
The obelisk transported us
to another planet.

26:17.370 --> 26:20.170
I think it's scheduled to go off
every couple of hours.

26:20.270 --> 26:21.710
<i>How are things out there?</i>

26:21.810 --> 26:26.070
Well, it's a little spooky,
but at least it's warm. How's Daniel?

26:28.250 --> 26:33.410
He's sitting up.
I'll get back to you on the rest.

26:38.230 --> 26:39.420
Hey.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.650
How you doing, sunshine?

26:49.440 --> 26:50.870
He was right.

26:53.510 --> 26:55.200
You do look like Percivale.

26:57.710 --> 26:58.680
Excuse me?

27:04.950 --> 27:07.550
We spent a lot of time in this room.

27:07.650 --> 27:09.140
Who did?

27:09.260 --> 27:10.450
We did.

27:12.090 --> 27:13.580
He did. Merlin.

27:14.690 --> 27:18.190
Sorry, it's a little confusing having
two sets of memories in your head.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.830
And he wasn't kidding
about living many lifetimes.

27:31.210 --> 27:34.310
- You have Merlin's memories?
- Some of them.

27:34.410 --> 27:40.380
Earth, Atlantis, and the different medieval
societies he set up throughout the galaxy.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.490
And the work he did in this lab.

27:45.590 --> 27:47.580
Hey, whoa, hey, hang on a second.

27:48.830 --> 27:51.760
Are you telling me
you can build the Sangraal?

27:51.870 --> 27:54.860
He knew he didn't have the strength
to finish it.

27:54.970 --> 27:58.930
His body had deteriorated too much
during the stasis.

28:02.980 --> 28:05.040
So he gave me the knowledge.

28:07.680 --> 28:08.740
Wait!

28:13.720 --> 28:15.380
I can see it now.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.920
I can do this.

28:23.860 --> 28:27.990
Twice, a device like that
almost killed General O'Neill.

28:28.100 --> 28:32.470
Both times,
it took the Asgard to save him.

28:32.570 --> 28:35.470
Daniel thought that
this device might be different,

28:35.580 --> 28:38.100
that somehow
the information could be limited.

28:40.650 --> 28:42.270
I hope he's right.

28:54.030 --> 28:59.190
We found the body of an old man, dead.
Apart from that, there's nothing here.

29:01.170 --> 29:02.190
(SIGHING)

29:02.300 --> 29:05.290
This is beginning to try my patience.

29:05.410 --> 29:09.000
Is there no other way we can track them?

29:09.110 --> 29:10.580
No.

29:10.680 --> 29:15.410
But each time I'm able to determine their
destination more quickly than the last.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.480
Sooner or later, we will catch up to them.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.070
Maybe we're barking up
the wrong tree here.

29:38.170 --> 29:41.870
Maybe the relocation program
isn't in the DHD processor at all.

29:42.710 --> 29:44.340
What, the obelisk?

29:44.440 --> 29:45.570
(CHUCKLING)

29:45.680 --> 29:49.080
You obviously have no idea
what you are talking about.

29:50.020 --> 29:53.250
Says the brainiac who spent three days
trapped in that force field.

29:53.350 --> 29:56.220
That technology is strictly used
for localized transport.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.290
Yeah, I know.

29:57.390 --> 29:59.020
I mean, it's obviously
what's beaming us through the gate

29:59.130 --> 30:00.890
every time there's an open wormhole,

30:00.990 --> 30:03.220
but what if it also contains
a remote dialer?

30:03.330 --> 30:05.890
It's one thing to send someone here
and there on the surface of the planet.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.490
It's quite another to send them
halfway across the galaxy.

30:08.600 --> 30:12.560
It's like comparing a laptop
to a supercomputer.

30:12.670 --> 30:17.110
Well, it wouldn't have to contain the
entire navigational system, now, would it?

30:17.210 --> 30:21.340
Just a command code sufficient
to override normal dialing protocols.

30:21.450 --> 30:22.570
Yes.

30:23.750 --> 30:25.650
But to borrow a rather
quaint human phrase,

30:25.750 --> 30:29.880
why hide a needle in a small haystack
when you can use an enormous one?

30:29.990 --> 30:31.220
It wouldn't be much of a security measure

30:31.320 --> 30:35.820
if it could be discovered by the first Tau'ri
female who comes along, would it, now?

30:35.930 --> 30:37.660
I'm sorry.

30:37.760 --> 30:41.720
Are you dismissing my idea out of hand
because I'm human

30:41.840 --> 30:42.930
or because I'm a woman?

30:43.700 --> 30:45.330
A little of both, I suppose.

30:46.640 --> 30:50.300
You know what? I'll check it myself.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.090
What is that?

31:07.190 --> 31:11.490
Stage one. The first step towards
creating Merlin's weapon.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.160
- It's real?
- Yeah.

31:17.170 --> 31:19.100
That's exactly what this device does.

31:19.210 --> 31:22.110
It allows you to design and configure
something virtually,

31:22.210 --> 31:23.700
and then it materializes it.

31:23.810 --> 31:27.370
Just like O'Neill did when he created
the anti-Replicator weapon.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.540
I thought the Sangraal
was a tiny red jewel.

31:29.650 --> 31:32.710
No, that's the final stage,
the key to making the whole thing work.

31:32.820 --> 31:35.850
So how long before you can put
the whole thing together?

31:35.960 --> 31:37.250
Daniel?

31:37.360 --> 31:38.590
(GROANING)

31:39.060 --> 31:40.990
I'm all right. I'm all right.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.360
This machine takes a lot out of you.

31:44.460 --> 31:47.490
The level of concentration required
is pretty intense.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.630
Can I get you anything?

31:49.740 --> 31:51.430
- Water.
- Sure.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.650
Okay, that happened.

32:06.050 --> 32:07.640
It's interesting.

32:08.120 --> 32:11.420
Jack got healing powers.
I guess I got telekinesis.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.860
Jack also almost died.

32:14.390 --> 32:16.520
Now, you said that
this device might be different.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.490
- I'll be fine.
- That's crap.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.430
She's right.
You don't get fancy mind powers

32:20.530 --> 32:23.160
unless there's been major redecorating
going on inside your skull.

32:23.270 --> 32:26.330
Look, obviously, creating the weapon
requires a higher level of brain function.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.300
Now, Merlin would've foreseen that.

32:30.410 --> 32:32.540
Trust me, I can handle this.

32:36.450 --> 32:37.710
Damn it.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.260
(CLEARING THROAT)

32:50.800 --> 32:51.990
What do you want?

32:53.800 --> 32:54.960
I need your help.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.040
Look, I still think
I'm right about the obelisk,

33:00.140 --> 33:03.130
but I can't make heads or tails
of its programming.

33:03.240 --> 33:06.540
Well, that's hardly surprising.

33:07.910 --> 33:11.980
I mean, I know where you come from
you're considered relatively intelligent,

33:12.090 --> 33:15.890
but by galactic standards,
that's not really saying much.

33:15.990 --> 33:17.480
Wouldn't you agree?

33:22.260 --> 33:25.320
You know, if you're not going to help
then you're really not much use to us,

33:25.430 --> 33:27.300
and if you're not much use to us,
then there's really no point

33:27.400 --> 33:29.430
in keeping you alive any longer.

33:29.540 --> 33:30.760
Wouldn't you agree?

33:31.000 --> 33:32.230
(SCOFFING)

33:38.980 --> 33:42.510
I'd be delighted to help.

33:43.620 --> 33:45.240
Great to hear it.

34:03.300 --> 34:05.970
- Stage two?
- Indeed.

34:08.470 --> 34:09.910
I must rest.

34:11.910 --> 34:14.380
I'm not as young as I used to be.

34:16.580 --> 34:19.610
Daniel? Are you all right?

34:21.990 --> 34:24.620
- I know you.
- Well, of course you do, silly.

34:24.720 --> 34:26.990
It's me. Vala.

34:33.700 --> 34:35.900
I had the strangest dream.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.200
Everything was covered in ice.

34:42.640 --> 34:43.870
Jackson.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.540
Daniel.

34:54.250 --> 34:55.410
What's going on?

34:55.520 --> 34:58.250
We're losing you, that's what's going on.

34:58.360 --> 35:01.190
Every time you come back from
that machine, it gets a little worse,

35:01.330 --> 35:03.060
and don't tell me you're fine.

35:03.960 --> 35:04.990
No.

35:05.830 --> 35:07.700
No, I just have...
I have too many thoughts in my head.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.700
- I can't concentrate. I get confused.
- You have to fight it.

35:10.800 --> 35:14.000
No, no, that's the thing.
I have to let it happen.

35:14.710 --> 35:17.800
That's the only way
I can build Merlin's weapon.

35:17.910 --> 35:19.210
(PANTING)

35:30.920 --> 35:33.790
You have to tell him that he doesn't have
to do this. He'll listen to you.

35:33.890 --> 35:37.590
Oh? What team have you been on?
Besides, we need this one.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.670
What makes you think
we'll even be allowed to use it?

35:39.770 --> 35:41.460
The Ancients didn't let Merlin get away
with it last time...

35:41.570 --> 35:44.870
Vala! Vala, shut up for once.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.760
We have to take the risk.

35:50.980 --> 35:52.070
What?

35:52.880 --> 35:55.870
This is all about noble sacrifice
for you, isn't it?

35:55.980 --> 35:58.350
- Oh, dear, I'm sorry, what about you?
- What?

35:58.450 --> 36:00.890
When you flew that cargo ship
into the gap of the supergate,

36:00.990 --> 36:04.480
you knew damn well that you might not
come out the other side alive.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.190
No, that was different.

36:07.290 --> 36:10.520
Yeah, different because
you were the one taking the risk.

36:13.370 --> 36:14.770
Well, now you know.

36:14.870 --> 36:20.130
The hard part about being part of
this team is not risking your own life.

36:20.240 --> 36:23.640
It's watching your friends
take chances with theirs.

36:25.140 --> 36:26.740
Congratulations.

36:27.910 --> 36:30.080
Now you really are one of us.

36:41.430 --> 36:45.230
It's a command override.
I can't believe we actually found it.

36:46.530 --> 36:48.830
Clearly, you work well together.

36:55.170 --> 36:56.660
Well, now that
we've identified the program,

36:56.780 --> 36:59.710
it should be a simple matter
to shut it down.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.660
(ENERGY SURGING)

37:20.200 --> 37:24.330
Ready your men. It's time.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.330
Yes, Orici.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.640
(ENERGY SURGING)

37:33.780 --> 37:35.180
What is it?

37:35.280 --> 37:38.010
- Get to the gate now.
- Why?

37:41.190 --> 37:42.710
They're coming.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.380
(STARGATE ACTIVATING)

37:46.490 --> 37:47.860
Incoming wormhole!

38:14.620 --> 38:16.680
Hold them here! I'll get help!

38:29.970 --> 38:31.160
(GROANING)

38:45.790 --> 38:47.550
Dr. Jackson.

38:52.260 --> 38:53.320
(SIGHING)

38:53.430 --> 38:55.050
You're too late.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.630
You haven't completed the weapon.
I'd say I'm just in time.

38:59.730 --> 39:01.030
And I'd say things are different now.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.850
Draining, isn't it?

39:21.390 --> 39:25.380
Instead of helping your friends, you should
have saved your energy to deal with me.

39:26.260 --> 39:28.520
Would it have made a difference?

39:32.160 --> 39:33.630
Probably not.

39:35.770 --> 39:37.460
What was that?

39:37.570 --> 39:40.370
I don't know, but I say
we don't stick around to find out.

39:40.470 --> 39:42.910
Dial out of here
before anyone else can dial in.

39:43.010 --> 39:44.240
I'm going to go check on Daniel.

39:47.210 --> 39:48.180
Daniel?

39:59.830 --> 40:01.120
Why do I bother?

40:03.730 --> 40:07.690
Adria, I want you to stop this right now.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.740
I'm sorry it has to be this way, Mother.

40:20.280 --> 40:23.310
- Get to the gate now.
- I'm not leaving you here.

40:23.420 --> 40:26.010
I'll be right behind you.

40:58.150 --> 40:59.280
No.

41:00.990 --> 41:03.550
There has to be a way
we can get back to that planet.

41:03.660 --> 41:06.750
A DHD buffer typically holds
the last 50 addresses that were dialed,

41:06.860 --> 41:08.990
and we went through three gates
before getting there.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.790
We've got a lot of planets to check.

41:10.900 --> 41:13.260
Adria found a way around the problem.

41:13.370 --> 41:18.100
Even if we could return to the planet, at
this point I fear it would do us little good.

41:18.270 --> 41:19.290
(HITTING KEYBOARD)

41:19.410 --> 41:20.460
(GRUNTING)

41:25.980 --> 41:27.950
At least we'd be doing something.

41:31.920 --> 41:35.750
Merlin gave Daniel
some pretty valuable intel.

41:35.860 --> 41:37.520
Adria knows that.

41:38.460 --> 41:39.750
Hey.

41:39.860 --> 41:41.760
She'll keep him alive.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.750
How are you feeling?

42:12.390 --> 42:14.590
I don't suppose you know
what a hangover is.

42:17.430 --> 42:18.520
(SIGHING)

42:18.630 --> 42:20.260
Never mind.

42:20.370 --> 42:22.600
I know the burden must be awful.

42:22.700 --> 42:25.900
Your brain simply wasn't built
to handle that much information.

42:26.010 --> 42:27.170
(GROANING)

42:27.270 --> 42:30.370
Well, whatever I had, it's gone,

42:30.480 --> 42:33.070
along with what feels like
half my brain cells.

42:34.410 --> 42:36.850
You'll forgive me
if I don't take your word for it.

42:39.650 --> 42:43.610
Now, rest. We have a lot of work to do.
