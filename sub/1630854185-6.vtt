Was I right?

01:35.963 --> 01:38.232
Somebody knock it down
to negative ten?

01:38.332 --> 01:39.233
Yep.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.634
Still got it.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.836
You can take the girl
out of Chi-town...

01:42.936 --> 01:47.275
You know, I came up solving
frozen-body cases like this.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.076
I did everything you do, plus...

01:49.177 --> 01:50.278
Walk ten miles
in the snow?

01:50.378 --> 01:51.479
As a matter of fact...

01:51.579 --> 01:53.981
Where are your damn coats?

01:54.081 --> 01:55.115
This is a coat.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.617
That's a glorified
jean jacket.

01:56.717 --> 02:00.988
All right, you're gonna
end up like this fella,

02:01.088 --> 02:02.323
whoever he is.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.392
Do we know?

02:04.492 --> 02:06.026
Do we know?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.361
Max, come on.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.897
That's Dario Donnelly,
as in Dario.

02:10.898 --> 02:11.999
Of Dario.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.534
Uh-uh.
Come on, Michelin-star chef

02:13.634 --> 02:15.002
of the restaurant
we're standing in.

02:15.102 --> 02:16.003
Huge social?
Oh.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.105
Yeah, oh, that Dario.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.473
You seem pretty excited.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.008
It's kind of creepy.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.510
So is this knife wound.

02:23.311 --> 02:26.146
Mr. Dario barely
bled from it.

02:26.247 --> 02:29.016
It's almost like he was stabbed
after he was frozen.

02:29.116 --> 02:32.653
Blood does freeze at about
the same temperature as water.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.888
Yeah, but the blade's
not very deep.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.458
Stuck right between
ribs seven and eight.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.960
I don't think it
killed him, either.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.296
Could be somebody was
just decorating.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.498
Who would do something
like this?

02:45.799 --> 02:47.268
The man was a massive talent.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.670
He helped feed the unhoused.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.905
He had incredible
bone structure.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.041
Looks like he was chiseled
by Michelangelo.

02:54.141 --> 02:57.445
Goodness gracious.
This must be really
hard for you.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.548
To lose someone
you follow on TikTok.

03:00.648 --> 03:03.751
I think I'm being perfectly
professional about this.

03:03.851 --> 03:04.985
Look, I'll check
with security, but...

03:05.085 --> 03:06.654
it's a pretty good spot
for a murder.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.589
Out of sight of
the cameras out front.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.958
Uh-oh, look at this.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.371
"I'm so sorry"?

03:23.471 --> 03:25.706
Wow.

03:28.509 --> 03:31.379
Nice of the killer
to sign his work.

03:31.479 --> 03:36.284
But not sorry enough
to confess.

Hey, fanboy,
get a shot of this.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.260
"Fanboy."

04:24.197 --> 04:25.866
Why do you think
they took off his shoes?

04:25.966 --> 04:27.267
Couldn't tell you.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.403
Don't be so sure
the killer did that.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.705
None of y'all ever heard of
paradoxical undressing?

04:31.805 --> 04:35.976
Never seen it,
but I suppose it's possible.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.445
What's possible?

04:37.545 --> 04:39.547
Go on.
Freezing to death makes

04:39.647 --> 04:41.482
your circulatory system
stop working.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.617
<i>Blood stops pumping
to your core,</i>

04:43.717 --> 04:46.053
<i>warm blood collects
in your arms and legs,</i>

04:46.153 --> 04:48.989
<i>making your extremities feel
scalding hot by comparison.</i>

04:49.089 --> 04:51.759
<i>Your brain's not getting
enough blood, either.</i>

04:51.859 --> 04:53.527
<i>You become delirious.</i>

04:53.627 --> 04:55.295
You start shedding clothes. Yeah.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.631
All right, so we can dust
for prints, but...

04:57.731 --> 05:01.068
Dario probably took off
his own shoes and socks.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.604
That is textbook peripheral vasodilatation.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.539
Kind of hard to say
what happened first.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.575
He was definitely trapped
in here long enough

05:07.675 --> 05:08.809
to freeze solid.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.345
And it doesn't take that long.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.883
Yeah, uh, could we do
Corpsicle 101 outside?

05:15.983 --> 05:16.884
Uh-huh.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.086
I don't want to become one.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.188
Oh, man,
I just can't warm up.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.590
Oh, me, neither.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.058
Okay, come on, you guys,
circle up, circle up.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.927
Okay, the thing
you gotta realize,

05:27.027 --> 05:30.798
subarctic temperatures
can be a blessing and a curse.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.634
Yeah, the ice man giveth,
the ice man taketh away.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.736
Yes, let's start with
"taketh away."

05:35.836 --> 05:39.573
You cannot autopsy
a block of ice, right?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.375
Uh, last time I called
the Butterball hotline,

05:41.475 --> 05:43.877
they had some pretty simple tips
on defrosting.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.446
But we ain't making dinner.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.516
If we warm Dario
over 38 degrees,

05:48.616 --> 05:50.518
his flesh will start
to decompose

05:50.618 --> 05:53.487
while his internal organs
are still frozen.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.955
Ugh.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.390
What about time of death? Cause?

05:56.490 --> 05:58.225
I mean, are we gonna have to
wait, like, days

05:58.325 --> 05:59.359
till he warms up?

05:59.460 --> 06:00.928
On some answers, yes.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.597
But we will roll with
the evidence that we do have.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.098
Well, maybe I can pull a print

06:05.198 --> 06:06.500
from the message
the killer left us.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.702
Mm, we might find some
on Dario himself.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.538
That's something ice
is good for.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.473
Holds a latent,
locks it in.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.408
We should print the whole staff

06:14.508 --> 06:16.209
since this was probably
an inside job.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.310
Yeah, you and I
could go outside,

06:17.411 --> 06:19.513
where the sun is shining.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.348
Uh, question.
What's that?

06:21.449 --> 06:23.016
Is someone feeling chilly?

06:23.116 --> 06:24.852
Get out.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.154
Get out. Come on.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.022
Go to the fridge,
get Dario,

06:29.122 --> 06:30.323
take him back
to the crypt.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.925
And make sure
you hold him upright.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.762
I don't need that man
breaking in half, okay?
Yep.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.165
Am I a...

06:38.265 --> 06:39.232
You think I...

06:39.332 --> 06:40.367
You're not a suspect, Albert.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.035
These are elimination prints.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.638
We know you touched Dario
when you found him. Yes.

06:44.738 --> 06:48.308
I go to help,
but I see his eyes open.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.410
I can never forget, you know?

06:52.713 --> 06:55.148
Do you know if anyone
in the kitchen was angry

06:55.248 --> 06:57.485
at your boss?
No.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.853
Week before last, I-I start,

06:59.953 --> 07:03.924
but I don't know anyone
who hates Dario.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.459
But he a tough man.

07:05.559 --> 07:09.863
He remind me of, uh...
of my father.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.268
Most of us hated Dario.

07:15.368 --> 07:16.970
But those same people
loved him, too.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.673
He was tough, but he also cared.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.042
Look what he did for
the unhoused of this city.

07:22.142 --> 07:25.245
Dario was just... a lot.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.080
When's the last time
you saw him?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.116
Last night, after we closed.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.918
He made family meal,
like always,

07:31.018 --> 07:32.219
then we all went home.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.154
Who else has access
to the kitchen?

07:34.254 --> 07:36.389
Just us, the staff.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.025
The customers were all gone.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.328
You need an I.D. to get in
through the service tunnel.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.731
It had to be one of us.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.769
You don't seem upset.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.971
Of course I'm upset.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.372
I had so many plans for Dario.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.407
I was going to make
his life hell.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.177
He cheated on me. Me!

07:57.277 --> 07:58.378
You do know you're
being questioned

07:58.478 --> 07:59.847
for a murder
investigation, right?

07:59.947 --> 08:02.616
Now I'm never gonna get
the chance to get back at him.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.184
It's so sad.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.554
So you-you are sorry he's dead?

08:07.354 --> 08:09.523
Of course I am.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.860
He used to make
this grilled cheese...

08:14.294 --> 08:16.964
Whoever killed him,
they never had that sandwich.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.535
<i>That man was a culinary genius.</i>

08:21.635 --> 08:24.404
But his whole public schtick--
Saint Dario--

08:24.504 --> 08:26.173
that was 180 degrees off.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.508
He was a raging egomaniac.

08:28.609 --> 08:31.311
Nobody who worked in his kitchen
was ever good enough.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.480
And you're the sous-chef,

08:33.581 --> 08:35.382
so you got it worse
than most, right?

08:35.482 --> 08:37.685
See this?

08:39.987 --> 08:40.954
"Silver."

08:41.054 --> 08:42.455
That's what Dario called me.

08:42.556 --> 08:45.893
Second place, 'cause I'd
never be a head chef.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.494
But I wore it.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.730
He knew how to motivate.
Motivated somebody

08:49.830 --> 08:52.132
to put a knife in his ribs.

08:52.232 --> 08:55.102
A knife with your initials
on it, right, Damien?

08:55.202 --> 08:57.537
I saw it. It was mine.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.240
But I left my knife kit
here last night.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.643
Anyone could have done it.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.613
I'd never hurt that man.

09:13.486 --> 09:15.322
Is that a luggage cart?

09:15.422 --> 09:16.724
Uh-huh.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.226
I explained what it was for
to the valets.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.994
They said I could keep it.

09:22.930 --> 09:26.466
I can't believe I'm about
to say this, but...

09:26.566 --> 09:28.201
It's not cold enough?
Not even close.

09:28.301 --> 09:31.538
It must be some kind of cooking
oil to still be semi-viscous.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.140
Okay, well, we need it
frozen solid

09:33.240 --> 09:35.609
if we're gonna make a cast
to look for latents.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.410
Compressed air should
make it easier

09:37.510 --> 09:39.012
to make the Mikrosil cast.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.448
Okay.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.485
You know what's crazy?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.655
Some people love
this kind of weather.

09:47.755 --> 09:50.523
They go skiing,
they go snowboarding.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.726
They move to places
like Chicago.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.728
And they love it.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.864
Yeah, 'cause they can't
hack the heat.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.767
That must be what it is.
It totally is.

09:59.867 --> 10:03.436
I mean, if you think about it,
we're the tough ones.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.712
We're not the tough ones,
are we?

10:11.812 --> 10:14.514
People move to the desert to
help with their arthritis.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.484
Of course we're not.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.493
Jack, come on.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.161
Have you ever seen
frozen eyeballs?

10:28.261 --> 10:29.830
I'm not <i>not</i> gonna look.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.564
He doesn't like being stared at.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.366
He didn't mention
anything to me.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.567
Did he say something to you?
Because I...

10:34.668 --> 10:37.504
Hey. Am I interrupting?

10:37.604 --> 10:39.807
Well, we're working
and you're not,

10:39.907 --> 10:41.374
so kinda.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.376
I've offended you
in some way.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.245
Not yet.
Okay, well,

10:45.345 --> 10:47.380
we're gonna solve this
little mystery another day,

10:47.480 --> 10:50.217
but right now I'm here to check
on our friend there, Dario.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.153
I thought Dr. Roby was
running point on this case.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.723
She is, but she's still
coming back from injury, so I...

10:55.823 --> 10:57.657
You want to help her. Yeah.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.860
That's actually kind of sweet.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.062
It's ridiculous but sweet.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.832
Why is it ridiculous?
Because you lack

11:04.932 --> 11:07.534
a magic wand to wave away
Newton's law of thermodynamics.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.669
Frozen dude's gotta
warm up slowly.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.839
This poor man's
blood vessels

11:11.939 --> 11:15.142
have not only been stabbed
and shredded by ice crystals,

11:15.242 --> 11:17.811
<i>but his cells are
also dehydrated,</i>

11:17.911 --> 11:19.479
<i>causing the membranes
to collapse and weaken.</i>

11:19.579 --> 11:22.082
<i>The faster Dario thaws,
the faster those ice crystals</i>

11:22.182 --> 11:24.617
<i>fuse and squeeze his cells
into even tighter spaces,</i>

11:24.718 --> 11:26.586
<i>ultimately deforming them.</i>

11:26.686 --> 11:29.689
Do you want us to deform
Dario's cells?

11:29.790 --> 11:33.693
Uh, no, I don't want to
deform Dario's cells.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.362
Then my assistant
will let you know

11:35.462 --> 11:36.663
when this man comes up to temp.

11:36.764 --> 11:40.167
Jack. <i>Jack</i> will let you know.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.302
In the meantime, you guys mind
if I take some pictures?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.404
Be my guest. Thanks.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.106
Jack, could you
help me out here?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.275
Uh, yeah. My pleasure.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.609
All right, nice.

11:51.578 --> 11:55.015
Great. Neck.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.687
So, if I adjust the contrast,

12:00.788 --> 12:02.255
we should be able to see...

12:03.090 --> 12:05.125
One second here.
What?

12:05.225 --> 12:06.894
I may not have a magic wand,

12:06.994 --> 12:09.863
but I do have a buddy that's
gonna help me pull those prints.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.166
Thanks.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.872
Try thinking warm thoughts.

12:19.672 --> 12:22.976
I'm thinking roaring fire.
Thicker socks.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.146
Some more socks on top of that.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.849
Oh, come on.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.723
Weird. The Mikrosil cast

12:36.824 --> 12:38.325
gives us prints but
not on every letter.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.894
Maybe the killer wrote
certain letters faster?

12:40.994 --> 12:42.395
I guess it doesn't
really matter.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.564
We got plenty to work with.

12:46.733 --> 12:49.136
Nice.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.052
Is this your natural state?

13:05.152 --> 13:06.954
You're just chugging
coffee all day?

13:07.054 --> 13:09.823
Caffeine's got nothing to do
with my mood.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.791
Oh, that's not
crack, is it?

13:11.892 --> 13:13.693
Ruthenium tetroxide.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.428
That's the real fun stuff here.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.866
One of your favorite
unstable molecules, is it?

13:18.966 --> 13:20.700
I'd put it on my Mount Rushmore.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.869
Probably number three.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.336
If we want to find out

13:23.436 --> 13:25.238
who touched Dario around
the time that he froze solid,

13:25.338 --> 13:28.008
there's nothing quite like this
temperamental diva of a crystal.

13:28.108 --> 13:31.444
All right, show me what
your Diana Ross of rocks can do.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.113
Mask up.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.752
Three, two, one.

14:09.216 --> 14:12.485
Nice prints.
Ruthenium tetroxide?

14:12.585 --> 14:13.786
Yours are pretty crisp, too.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.555
Mikrosil cast?
Mm-hmm.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.057
I can't remember
the last time we pulled

14:17.157 --> 14:19.326
so many usable prints
from a scene. Mm.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.062
The ice man giveth.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.166
What's wrong?

14:26.266 --> 14:29.302
The killer didn't
leave us that message.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.238
Dario did.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.506
Those were his prints
in the oil.

14:33.606 --> 14:34.874
Dario the victim?

14:34.975 --> 14:36.843
He's the guy who wrote
"I'm so sorry"?

14:36.944 --> 14:38.445
That's sad, isn't it?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.180
To die so full of regret.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.016
But what was he apologizing for?
Mm-mm-mm.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.418
Maybe he spat
in someone's food.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.355
I mean, that is what
we all worry happens back there.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.789
Right?
I am now.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.294
Actually, that might explain...

14:54.394 --> 14:57.998
Hey, look at the oil
from the message.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.135
What are all the flecks
mixed in it?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.971
That's what I've been wondering.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.106
But since Dario wrote the
message, not the killer,

15:06.206 --> 15:07.840
now I'm thinking
it might just be

15:07.941 --> 15:09.242
some sort of cooking spice.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.777
If it all went down
in the kitchen,

15:10.877 --> 15:12.279
I guess it wouldn't
be surprising. Mm.

15:12.379 --> 15:15.482
Not so fast. Frozen body cases
will surprise you.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.749
They always do.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.685
Here's something.
Hmm?

15:18.785 --> 15:22.589
The prints on Dario's body
belong to Valerie Bianco.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.024
The hostess.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.993
Chavez did say
Dario was cheating on her.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.261
Maybe she...

15:28.361 --> 15:30.063
And Damien Pak.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.132
The sous-chef? Wait a minute.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.167
He did have beef
with Dario.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.935
The guy even tattooed
his name...

15:36.036 --> 15:38.238
And Albert Santoni.
Well, the dishwasher.

15:38.338 --> 15:42.375
I mean, at least we know why
his prints are all over him.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.411
And Holly Prince.

15:44.511 --> 15:45.445
The doe-eyed server?

15:45.545 --> 15:46.779
I'm sorry, you mean to tell me

15:46.879 --> 15:49.016
after all that work
and freezing my nose off,

15:49.116 --> 15:51.951
all we know is half the kitchen
staff could've killed him?

15:52.052 --> 15:54.254
I didn't say it'd be
a good surprise.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.438
I don't know what to tell you.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.940
Dario really made my, uh...

16:14.041 --> 16:15.942
appetite whet last night.

16:16.043 --> 16:19.812
Yeah, we found your fingerprints
all over his face.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.715
You can probably find
even more, uh...

16:22.815 --> 16:24.584
you know.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.854
You seemed pretty upset when you
told me he was cheating on you.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.256
You find that out before

16:29.356 --> 16:31.191
or after you slept with him
that night?

16:31.291 --> 16:32.625
I'll be honest.
It was after.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.194
He wouldn't tell me who,
but I know

16:34.294 --> 16:35.328
it was someone
at the restaurant.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.197
A love triangle.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.799
That sounds complicated.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.369
I'm not proud of it.
I slapped him.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.970
That's all I did to him.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.039
You had motive, access.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.075
So did this other bitch,
whoever she is.

16:49.076 --> 16:51.978
If you find out who it was,
will you tell me?

16:52.079 --> 16:53.546
No.
No.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.824
So, what was the nature
of your relationship

17:04.924 --> 17:07.127
with Dario?

17:07.227 --> 17:08.595
We worked together.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.130
Mm.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.365
We found your prints
on his hands,

17:12.465 --> 17:14.767
on his jacket
and on his neck.

17:15.735 --> 17:19.005
We fool around s-sometimes.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.408
It wasn't serious.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.343
It just started a few weeks ago.
No one knows.

17:23.443 --> 17:26.113
Actually, the other woman Dario
was sleeping with also knows.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.148
What other woman?

17:28.248 --> 17:29.882
There was another woman?

17:30.983 --> 17:33.553
Wh...
Who?

17:41.761 --> 17:45.398
Yes, I touch, uh, Dario
many time

17:45.498 --> 17:47.800
when I find him.
We know, Albert.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.470
You had every reason to help
your boss when you found him.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.839
But some of your prints
were on his neck.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.006
Under his collar.

17:54.107 --> 17:57.444
And that-that didn't
make sense to us.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.680
I don't, um... I...

18:02.182 --> 18:04.484
Sorry, uh, my English...

18:11.791 --> 18:13.760
Where'd you learn Italian?
You study abroad?

18:13.860 --> 18:18.097
I studied an Italian gentleman
before my ex-husband.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.546
He's talking about Damien,

18:33.646 --> 18:35.182
the sous-chef?
Mm-hmm.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.084
Ask him how things were
between him and Dario.

18:49.929 --> 18:53.032
Everybody's had an excuse so far
except for Mr. Pak.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.902
He's the only one that
didn't show up today.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.177
He's at the restaurant.

19:07.947 --> 19:11.150
Yeah, Valerie's story
seems plausible.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.652
They all do, actually.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.154
He close to temp yet?
No.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.789
Not even gonna check?

19:16.889 --> 19:19.392
You've got unrealistic expectations

19:19.492 --> 19:20.693
about corpse thawing.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.161
Yeah, you kind of do.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.931
I just thought, 'cause
he's starting to smell.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.933
What? I haven't
smelled anything.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.437
Did you bring shrimp empanadas
for lunch again?

19:30.537 --> 19:32.505
It was one time.
Wrong, Jack.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.674
It wasn't. Because
shrimp juice is forever.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.776
No, no, it's coming
from Dario, and it's not shrimp.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.078
It smells like, um...

19:39.178 --> 19:40.146
nuts?

19:40.247 --> 19:41.581
I swear I'm not crazy.

19:46.819 --> 19:47.987
I can't smell anything,

19:48.087 --> 19:50.257
but do you mean
like almonds?

19:50.357 --> 19:52.792
Yes! Almonds.
That's exactly it.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.861
But if you can't smell it,
then how'd you know that?

19:54.961 --> 19:56.263
Well, Dario's body
still doesn't have

19:56.363 --> 19:58.064
bluish postmortem lividity.

19:58.164 --> 20:00.433
<i>A corpse at room temperature
will experience livor mortis.</i>

20:00.533 --> 20:03.970
<i>Blood succumbs to gravity
and pools at its lowest point.</i>

20:04.070 --> 20:06.138
<i>That's when the deoxygenation
of the hemoglobin forms</i>

20:06.239 --> 20:08.375
<i>deoxyhemoglobin.
Body turns blue.</i>

20:08.475 --> 20:09.909
<i>But that never happened
with Dario</i>

20:10.009 --> 20:11.944
<i>because he was frozen.</i>

20:12.044 --> 20:13.880
He remained pink because...
Gravity couldn't do its thing.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.382
The fact that he's
still pink tells us

20:15.482 --> 20:17.384
there's something else
going on here, though.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.686
Because hemoglobin and oxygen
can't detach from one another.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.455
As Dario thaws,
his body starts to release

20:22.555 --> 20:24.023
hydrogen-based gases.

20:24.123 --> 20:27.327
Gases that neither Jack nor I
apparently can smell.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.896
Which means that Dario may have
actually died from...

20:32.031 --> 20:33.433
Really?

20:33.533 --> 20:35.835
I-I swear, I was following you
until two seconds ago.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.637
If the gas smells like
bitter almonds...

20:37.737 --> 20:40.172
It means you two are in
the 25% of the population

20:40.273 --> 20:42.709
that can't smell benzaldehyde.
The chemical that gives

20:42.809 --> 20:45.512
a distinctive smell
to both almonds and...

20:45.612 --> 20:47.013
Cyanide.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.248
So this guy wasn't just
stabbed and frozen.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.350
He was also poisoned.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.884
Someone really wanted him dead.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.287
So, which method
was the cause of death?

20:54.387 --> 20:55.688
I'll let you know.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.123
In about three days.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.637
Hey, Damien.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.905
What you got there?

21:13.005 --> 21:14.607
Some mint?

21:14.707 --> 21:17.310
And rosemary and marjoram.

21:17.410 --> 21:20.647
Gonna make a pork loin special.
That's right.

21:20.747 --> 21:21.714
You're taking over
the restaurant

21:21.814 --> 21:23.282
now that Dario's gone.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.785
Is that why you were too busy
to come answer our questions?

21:25.885 --> 21:28.955
Ooh, you mind if I take
one of these?

21:29.055 --> 21:30.757
Kind of what
I was hoping to find.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.659
Why's that?

21:32.759 --> 21:34.260
You grind down
enough peach pits,

21:34.361 --> 21:37.697
and you get this compound
called amygdalin.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.700
And do you know what that
breaks down into?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.569
Uh, no.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.036
Cyanide.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.373
I'm gonna test this to see
if it's the same kind

21:46.473 --> 21:48.007
that Dario ingested.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.677
Come on,
you didn't know that?

21:50.777 --> 21:52.745
Cooking is chemistry, Damien.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.715
I-I don't, uh... I didn't...

21:55.815 --> 21:58.351
So Dario was poisoned?
And frozen.

21:58.451 --> 22:01.754
And stabbed.
And choked by you.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.192
I'm not gonna apologize
for that.

22:06.292 --> 22:07.460
He apologized to me.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.861
Back up.

22:08.961 --> 22:11.998
We fought sometimes, yes.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.700
Uh, physically.
A shove. A smack.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.603
I grabbed him by the neck when
he came at me the other night.

22:16.703 --> 22:17.670
Why'd he do that?

22:17.770 --> 22:19.672
I told him I was leaving.

22:19.772 --> 22:22.375
I got a job interview,
and I was gonna...

22:22.475 --> 22:24.644
Baby bird's leaving the nest.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.546
Yes, okay?

22:26.646 --> 22:29.215
I saw him like a father. That's
why I would never hurt him.

22:29.315 --> 22:31.884
You must be unfamiliar
with the stats on patricide.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.486
No, no, no, we got over it.

22:33.586 --> 22:34.987
We always do.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.424
We made up by family meal.
You can ask anyone.

22:37.524 --> 22:40.192
What about Valerie the server
or Holly the hostess?

22:40.292 --> 22:43.362
Would either of them have
a reason to hurt Dario?

22:43.463 --> 22:46.466
Actually, Valerie's the hostess,
and Holly's the server.

22:46.566 --> 22:49.368
And as easy as it would be
for me to point fingers,

22:49.469 --> 22:51.604
I really doubt it.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.674
We all loved him best we could.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.577
Can I go now?
Yeah.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.279
Excuse me.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.583
You doing okay?

23:03.683 --> 23:07.019
I only ask because you
confused Holly and Valerie.

23:07.119 --> 23:09.155
Yeah, I got, like,
12 cases on my desk.

23:09.255 --> 23:10.389
It happens.

23:10.490 --> 23:13.125
Sure. But I'm just curious, though.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.328
You sleeping okay?
Since your attack.

23:16.429 --> 23:19.832
I'm just wondering. I've seen
this kind of thing before.
Uh-huh.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.868
Actually, I've been there myself.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.335
I know nights can be
the hardest part.

23:23.436 --> 23:24.904
Detective Chavez,
this is none of your...

23:25.004 --> 23:26.839
You were colder than me
in that freezer,

23:26.939 --> 23:28.107
even with your coat.

23:28.207 --> 23:29.642
Your circadian rhythm's
messed up,

23:29.742 --> 23:31.678
and now you're a little foggy.

23:31.778 --> 23:35.114
Wow, you got all
the answers, huh?

23:35.214 --> 23:37.383
I'm just gonna tell you,
try humming.
Mm-hmm.

23:37.484 --> 23:40.052
Uh, it releases melatonin
or something.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.621
It worked for me. Mm.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.524
Thanks. You're driving.

23:55.034 --> 23:58.771
Oi-oi, there he is.
The man with the golden nose.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.240
Cyanide, huh?
That's the theory.

24:01.340 --> 24:02.709
Unconfirmed.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.011
We still can't test
his body.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.316
Hello, Chris.
How are you?

24:10.416 --> 24:12.852
Oh, I'm fine, Chris.
Thanks for asking.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.120
He won't get
off his phone.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.922
I think it's generational.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.456
You're one year older than me.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.191
So, I was thinking,
even though we can't

24:19.291 --> 24:21.761
test Dario, maybe we can
still figure out

24:21.861 --> 24:23.295
how the poison got
into his body.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.297
Run some tests
back at the kitchen?

24:25.397 --> 24:27.500
Something he ate or drank
at that last supper they had?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.702
Maybe. But the cyanide
only affected Dario.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.538
I mean, no one
else got sick.

24:31.638 --> 24:34.240
Hey, what if Dario absorbed
the cyanide

24:34.340 --> 24:35.808
through his hands?

24:37.209 --> 24:39.478
See, look. Dario was famous
for his spice rub.

24:39.579 --> 24:40.813
No one knew what was in it.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.248
No one was even allowed
to touch it.

24:42.348 --> 24:45.317
So, if the spice rub was laced
with the cyanide,

24:45.417 --> 24:47.520
Dario easily could have
absorbed it through his skin.

24:47.620 --> 24:50.289
I did find traces of a spice
in some of the letters

24:50.389 --> 24:52.424
in Dario's message
in the fridge.

24:52.525 --> 24:54.561
And Dario always prepped
the next day's meat

24:54.661 --> 24:58.130
at the end of dinner service,
so I've learned.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.132
We should make sure
no one eats that meat.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.101
A hundred percent.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.436
Also, I cannot believe
I'm saying this, but...

25:04.537 --> 25:06.372
thank you

25:06.472 --> 25:09.341
for spending the last
20 minutes on your phone.

25:09.441 --> 25:12.144
It's a service I provide.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.919
Beau.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.988
Oh, you look broken.

25:22.088 --> 25:25.057
Okay, hotshot, you try
adjusting the GC/MS sensitivity

25:25.157 --> 25:26.759
so it has a chance
of detecting a compound

25:26.859 --> 25:29.428
with a molar weight lighter
than carbon dioxide.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.863
Mm, that's okay.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.364
Now, it took a whole
pot of coffee,

25:32.464 --> 25:36.603
both PhDs to calibrate it,
but at 27.0253 grams per mol,

25:36.703 --> 25:39.171
we'd never find the cyanide
if we weren't looking for it.

25:39.271 --> 25:40.973
Okay, so let's look for it.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.909
Let's do this.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.778
♪ I'm having vivid dreams ♪

25:45.878 --> 25:47.479
♪ That you're all over me ♪

25:47.580 --> 25:48.715
Thank you.

25:48.815 --> 25:51.584
♪ You got me hooked ♪

25:53.653 --> 25:56.122
♪ You got me hooked ♪

25:59.458 --> 26:02.028
♪ You keep on reelin' me in ♪

26:02.128 --> 26:03.963
♪ Keep, keep on reelin' me in ♪

26:04.063 --> 26:06.498
♪ You got me hooked ♪

26:06.599 --> 26:10.637
♪ You got me, got me,
got me, oh. ♪

26:10.737 --> 26:12.538
Oh, that feels good.

26:12.639 --> 26:13.640
Confirmed.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.508
The rub was laced with cyanide.

26:16.609 --> 26:17.710
But not enough to kill him.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.311
What do you mean?
Dario's DL50 number.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.013
That's the measurement at which
half the people his weight

26:21.113 --> 26:23.049
would die, and half would
survive poisoning.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.483
It's nine grams.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.385
Well, what's the concentration
of the spice rub?

26:26.485 --> 26:27.519
Seven-point-two.

26:27.620 --> 26:28.755
I mean, it would
knock him on is butt,

26:28.855 --> 26:30.289
but it wouldn't kill him.

26:30.389 --> 26:33.559
<i>With that much cyanide,
it might cause seizure</i>

26:33.660 --> 26:35.261
<i>or cardiac arrest.</i>

26:35.361 --> 26:37.496
<i>Definitely loss
of consciousness.</i>

26:37.596 --> 26:40.900
So Dario was alive,
just paralyzed,

26:41.000 --> 26:42.835
before someone
locked him in the fridge

26:42.935 --> 26:45.071
and froze him to death?

26:47.573 --> 26:49.809
So, we're starting to
get a clearer picture

26:49.909 --> 26:52.211
of how Dario Donnelly died.

26:52.311 --> 26:55.214
He was exposed to
a nonfatal level of cyanide.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.449
Boss? Seriously?
Hmm?

26:57.549 --> 26:59.118
You are just as bad
as he is.

26:59.218 --> 27:01.120
I have some news here.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.655
Yeah, sorry.

27:02.755 --> 27:03.990
So do we.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.291
You know I'm all over
Dario's social?

27:05.391 --> 27:08.060
Look what someone
just posted.

27:14.566 --> 27:17.904
Somebody's really
enjoying themselves.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.217
Okay, freeze right there.
No pun intended.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.551
That is not a picture

27:32.651 --> 27:33.986
a killer took
of a dead man.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.454
You're right.
He has a little stubble here.

27:35.554 --> 27:36.756
This is just shot
to make him look frozen.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.624
I want to know where
he got that photo.

27:38.725 --> 27:40.626
What makes you so sure
it was just one killer?

27:40.727 --> 27:42.561
We have prints from
four different people,

27:42.661 --> 27:44.196
most of whom had motive. Right.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.765
More than one M.O., too.

27:45.865 --> 27:46.966
Knife, freezer, cyanide.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.600
Maybe one person
started the job,

27:48.701 --> 27:49.836
someone else finished it?
Maybe.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.838
Or maybe when one killer
didn't succeed,

27:51.938 --> 27:53.672
he was taught to try,
try again.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.541
Look at his handle.

27:55.641 --> 27:57.343
"LookPa, IMadeIt"?

27:57.443 --> 27:58.811
Someone had daddy issues.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.579
You think?

28:03.482 --> 28:05.617
All right, this picture of Dario

28:05.718 --> 28:08.520
came from Damien Pak's
birthday party.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.389
You don't say.

28:10.489 --> 28:11.657
It was posted
on a public account.

28:11.758 --> 28:12.992
Anyone could've
grabbed it.

28:13.092 --> 28:14.727
Or maybe it was just
birthday boy himself.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.496
You know, Dario also made
his Michelin-star grilled cheese

28:17.596 --> 28:19.365
for family meal before he died.

28:19.465 --> 28:20.800
So...?

28:20.900 --> 28:23.936
So you get to go tell Sonya
we're tired of waiting.

28:29.675 --> 28:30.777
And...

28:30.877 --> 28:32.544
that should do it.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.580
You love your job, don't you?
I do.

28:34.680 --> 28:35.647
All right, Jack, you're up.

28:35.748 --> 28:38.117
All right.
Watch and learn.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.519
All right,

28:40.619 --> 28:42.054
no pressure, Jack.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.990
All right. You want to take
a look at this fella's

28:44.090 --> 28:45.591
last meal?

28:48.427 --> 28:49.561
And...

28:49.661 --> 28:51.263
we are in, baby.

28:51.363 --> 28:52.498
Respect.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.433
This guy could
put it away.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.302
Yep. There's the grilled cheese.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.971
His entire last dinner's here,
and it's completely undigested.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.539
Which means
Dario had to have been poisoned

29:00.639 --> 29:01.941
right after family meal

29:02.041 --> 29:03.209
with the staff.
Given how little

29:03.309 --> 29:05.077
of this meal
actually was digested,

29:05.177 --> 29:07.246
the killer must've put him
on ice right away.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.683
<i>They got him in the fridge...</i>

29:12.785 --> 29:14.653
<i>...lowered the temp
to negative ten,</i>

29:14.753 --> 29:17.256
<i>left him to die
and the deed was done.</i>

29:17.356 --> 29:18.624
<i>Or so they thought.</i>

29:18.724 --> 29:21.560
But the concentration of cyanide
was too low.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.963
Wasn't even enough
to keep him sedated.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.932
You think Dario woke back up
in the fridge?

29:26.032 --> 29:28.901
He had to. That's when
he took off his shoes and socks.

29:40.046 --> 29:42.815
And that's when he wrote
the message on the glass.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.354
<i>At some point,
the killer realized</i>

29:48.454 --> 29:50.089
<i>his plan had failed...</i>

29:50.857 --> 29:53.125
<i>...grabbed a knife
from Damien's kit...</i>

29:53.926 --> 29:56.295
<i>...stuck it
between Dario's ribs...</i>

29:58.664 --> 30:01.733
...hoisted him on the meat
hook and left him to freeze.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.903
Yeah. I buy
that order of events.

30:04.003 --> 30:06.272
Still doesn't tell
us who killed him.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.440
Or why Dario wrote
"I'm so sorry."

30:08.540 --> 30:11.743
Maybe he just regretted eating
the entire damn kitchen.

30:11.844 --> 30:14.580
We got cheese, beef...

30:14.680 --> 30:15.848
lamb.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.149
Could be lamb. Could be beef.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.485
It's hard to tell.
There's peppers, onions...

30:19.585 --> 30:21.620
Jack, no one cares.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.055
Really?

30:23.155 --> 30:24.790
A great chef's last supper.
Not interested?

30:24.891 --> 30:26.125
Oh, what-what
were you saying?

30:26.225 --> 30:27.659
About the beef
and the lamb?

30:27.759 --> 30:29.095
Uh, just that
they look

30:29.195 --> 30:31.097
exactly the same but they're
completely different...

30:31.964 --> 30:33.265
Thank you! Got to go!

30:33.365 --> 30:35.101
...animals.

30:37.569 --> 30:38.804
Hmm.

30:38.905 --> 30:40.406
You're right.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.875
All the letters in the message
with Dario's prints

30:42.975 --> 30:44.776
also have traces
of the rub.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.345
But the letters
without Dario's prints

30:46.445 --> 30:49.015
are spice-less and smooth.

30:49.115 --> 30:50.482
They're completely
different animals.

30:50.582 --> 30:54.053
So Dario didn't just write
some letters faster.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.655
It's... almost as if
an entirely different person

30:56.755 --> 30:57.723
wrote them.

30:57.823 --> 30:59.158
While wearing a rubber glove.

31:00.927 --> 31:03.595
So, we know he wrote the "Y."

31:03.695 --> 31:04.863
And an "S."

31:04.964 --> 31:06.732
And the "M."

31:06.832 --> 31:09.468
And another "S."
But not in that order.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.303
"M."

31:12.204 --> 31:13.505
"S."

31:14.506 --> 31:16.042
Ooh. <i>Wordle?</i>

31:16.142 --> 31:18.911
No. Just trying to figure out
what Dario was telling us.

31:19.011 --> 31:21.513
Oh. CSI <i>Wordle.</i>

31:21.613 --> 31:22.949
Looks like
that man,

31:23.049 --> 31:24.984
in his dying moments, wrote...

31:25.884 --> 31:27.619
"...messy."

31:27.719 --> 31:28.921
"Messy"?

31:29.021 --> 31:30.089
That's all you got?

31:30.189 --> 31:31.557
Yeah. Final answer.
"Messy."

31:31.657 --> 31:32.891
You're just missing
the "E."

31:32.992 --> 31:34.426
He was dying.

31:34.526 --> 31:35.928
Freezing.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.863
Maybe he forgot to write it.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.800
Actually,

31:41.900 --> 31:44.003
look.

31:44.971 --> 31:47.573
Between the "M" in "I'm"

31:47.673 --> 31:49.475
and the "S" in "so,"

31:49.575 --> 31:51.777
there's a... little smear.

31:51.877 --> 31:52.811
There's your "E."

31:52.911 --> 31:54.280
Somebody wiped it away.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.914
Messy.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.549
Messy.
Messy.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.918
What do you
think it means?

32:08.494 --> 32:10.062
That's dead plate number six, people.

32:10.162 --> 32:12.898
It's not GBD if you
just let it die on the pass.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.500
Yes, Chef!

32:14.600 --> 32:16.102
Look who's top chef now.

32:16.202 --> 32:17.936
Damn it, Sancho,
the board hasn't moved.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.105
Come on.
Sorry, Chef.

32:19.205 --> 32:20.372
Funny how
that works, huh?

32:20.472 --> 32:22.408
He's got
the demanding boss playbook.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.177
I don't have time right now.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.279
No, no, no.
That's not how this works.

32:27.379 --> 32:29.781
You're living the dream here,
huh, Damien?

32:29.881 --> 32:32.251
You got the kitchen,
the title, the power.

32:32.351 --> 32:33.819
You kidding me?
I am short-staffed.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.521
You people
confiscated my meat.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.023
The kitchen's a mess.

32:37.123 --> 32:40.126
And everyone's forgotten how
to cook rib eye medium rare.

32:40.226 --> 32:43.029
So you don't like
the kitchen a mess, huh?

32:43.129 --> 32:45.364
Got to have Messy
or it gets messy.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.566
Whoa, what-what
are you talking about?

32:47.666 --> 32:50.002
She's talking about half
our freaking problem.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.470
Messy's not here,
and we need him.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.406
Washing dishes,
Johnny-on-the-spot, you know?

32:55.374 --> 32:57.009
Messy is a person?

32:57.109 --> 32:58.677
Yeah. You met him.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.379
Guy hasn't shown up to
work since Dario died.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.015
Said he's too shaken to work
after what happened.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.217
God, he's such
a delicate <i>paisan.</i>

33:05.317 --> 33:07.753
Wait a minute,
so Albert is Messy?

33:07.853 --> 33:09.788
Does everybody
call Albert "Messy"?

33:09.888 --> 33:10.989
Most of us.
It's the nickname

33:11.090 --> 33:12.191
Dario gave him.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.126
"It's Messy. Where's Messy?

33:14.226 --> 33:15.961
Come here, Messy."
I don't think

33:16.062 --> 33:17.596
he ever bothered to learn
Albert's real name.

33:17.696 --> 33:18.664
Why?

33:28.740 --> 33:30.842
Dario was telling us
who killed him.

33:30.942 --> 33:31.843
Yeah.

33:31.943 --> 33:34.346
Until he got caught.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.059
Hey.
Hey.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.428
LVPD has an ATL out
for Albert Santoni,

33:49.528 --> 33:50.696
but no bites yet.

33:50.796 --> 33:51.997
You got anything?

33:52.098 --> 33:53.299
You mean proof? No.

33:53.399 --> 33:54.300
Just questions.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.867
What do you mean?

33:55.967 --> 33:56.735
Okay.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.070
Like, how does someone

33:58.170 --> 34:00.839
with a thin grasp
of the English language

34:00.939 --> 34:04.310
have the wherewithal to change
"Messy" into "I'm so sorry"?

34:04.410 --> 34:05.977
That's
a good question.

34:06.078 --> 34:08.614
It's not like he had much time
to think about it.
Right?

34:08.714 --> 34:10.382
I checked cameras.
Mm-hmm.

34:10.482 --> 34:13.018
He was out the door before half
the staff exited the casino.

34:13.119 --> 34:14.453
There you go.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.324
Yoga or Pilates?

34:18.424 --> 34:19.758
Pilates.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.529
Does that help you with, um...

34:23.629 --> 34:25.697
what you're going through?

34:27.065 --> 34:28.700
Usually.

34:32.204 --> 34:33.872
Breathe.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:33.972 --> 34:36.508
He's talking to himself.
After we left.

34:37.843 --> 34:39.478
Breathe.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.515
Just give it a minute.

34:44.450 --> 34:47.619
Then we'll stroll out of here
like Keyser Söze.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.989
What happened to his accent?

34:51.757 --> 34:53.959
And who mutters
in a second language?

34:54.059 --> 34:56.695
Using pop culture references.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.600
Who is this guy?

35:01.700 --> 35:04.270
A killer who lied
to the police.

35:04.370 --> 35:05.904
We got to get
a warrant.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.241
Nicely done.

35:09.341 --> 35:10.542
Yeah.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.278
Took me long enough.

35:12.378 --> 35:13.679
Yes, hey, it's Max.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.947
We need a warrant.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.190
Hey.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.226
I'm just gonna say it--

35:27.326 --> 35:29.361
it's an awfully nice place
for a dishwasher.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.230
Same address

35:31.330 --> 35:32.731
on Albert's W-2, but...

35:32.831 --> 35:34.866
the name doesn't match
his mail.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.536
You think he's using a fake
identity to wash dishes?

35:37.636 --> 35:38.704
Who does that?

35:38.804 --> 35:40.906
Peter "Nesico-lotchy,"

35:41.006 --> 35:42.508
apparently.

35:42.608 --> 35:44.009
Hey.

35:44.109 --> 35:47.213
I think you're gonna need
to update that ATL.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.382
Peter "Nesico-lossy"?

35:50.482 --> 35:52.551
I think you're both pronouncing
it wrong, but at least

35:52.651 --> 35:54.620
he's not lying
about being Italian.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.424
Look, I'll call it in, but...

35:58.524 --> 36:00.959
I don't know, this place
doesn't look too crazypants.

36:01.059 --> 36:02.828
Mm-hmm.

36:03.795 --> 36:04.996
Are we sure this is the guy?

36:05.096 --> 36:07.366
Well, whoever it is,
he's the guy

36:07.466 --> 36:08.834
who posted
the Dead Dario Dance.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.574
Oh.

36:21.713 --> 36:24.082
Oh, this looks promising.

36:25.617 --> 36:26.918
Oh.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.687
So that's what this is.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.088
Albert or whatever
we want to call him,

36:30.188 --> 36:32.324
he was obsessed
with Dario.

36:32.424 --> 36:35.361
So he adopted a new identity
as a dishwasher

36:35.461 --> 36:36.995
to get close to him. Why?

36:37.095 --> 36:38.830
That, I don't know,
but I'm pretty sure

36:38.930 --> 36:41.132
Dario chose the wrong guy
to nickname.

36:41.233 --> 36:43.502
Look at these dates.
Peter didn't start

36:43.602 --> 36:44.836
researching Dario
till a month ago.

36:44.936 --> 36:46.204
Wow. Guy moves fast.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.806
He's already been
at the restaurant three weeks.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.140
Peter knew his way
around graphic arts.

36:49.241 --> 36:51.477
He created
Albert's fake green card,

36:51.577 --> 36:54.946
his fake Social Security card,
made that fun video.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.648
"Albert" may
be new, but...

36:56.748 --> 36:59.451
I doubt it was this guy's first
time at the fake I.D. rodeo.

37:01.587 --> 37:02.488
I wonder if...

37:02.588 --> 37:04.222
"Peter" is real, either.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.793
He is. I have the transcript
here from Peter Nesicolacci's

37:07.893 --> 37:09.395
most recent criminal trial.

37:09.495 --> 37:10.629
"Most recent"?

37:10.729 --> 37:12.063
We got his whole
tale of woe here

37:12.163 --> 37:14.032
in the pleading.
So, he's assumed

37:14.132 --> 37:15.334
different identities before.

37:15.434 --> 37:16.735
His parents <i>are</i> Italian,

37:16.835 --> 37:18.504
but he grew up in and out
of abusive foster homes

37:18.604 --> 37:19.771
here in Vegas.

37:19.871 --> 37:22.040
Been in and out
of the system ever since.

37:22.908 --> 37:23.809
He ever killed before?

37:23.909 --> 37:26.244
Uh, not that
LVPD knows,

37:26.345 --> 37:28.046
but he has a history
of assault and battery.

37:28.146 --> 37:29.515
What about obsessive behavior?

37:29.615 --> 37:30.782
Stalking?

37:30.882 --> 37:32.183
We think Peter changed
his name and pursued

37:32.284 --> 37:34.520
the dishwashing gig
to get close to Dario.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.422
That would be a new one
for this guy.

37:36.522 --> 37:38.123
But put him

37:38.223 --> 37:40.526
in a stressful work environment
with an abusive boss and...

37:41.960 --> 37:43.929
Oh. Oh. Uh...

37:44.029 --> 37:45.597
Stop! Stop!

37:46.965 --> 37:49.100
Peter!

37:49.200 --> 37:50.802
Wait!

37:53.605 --> 37:54.506
Stop!

37:54.606 --> 37:55.774
Control, H-11.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.008
Requesting backup.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.344
Suspect headed to the roof.

38:03.248 --> 38:04.249
Peter!

38:11.723 --> 38:13.058
Hey!

38:13.158 --> 38:15.260
All right. Hey, Peter,
Peter, Peter! Okay. All right.

38:15.361 --> 38:16.795
All right, there's
nowhere else to run, man.

38:16.895 --> 38:18.296
Can we stop?

38:20.098 --> 38:21.633
Let's stop.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.369
Oh, I can't go back in.

38:23.469 --> 38:24.503
Now, now,
Peter, listen,

38:24.603 --> 38:25.804
just talk to me.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.305
No, you don't
understand.
What?

38:27.406 --> 38:29.675
There's no hope
for me out here, man.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.242
None.
Hey. Okay,
but this was

38:31.343 --> 38:34.012
the plan, right? This-- You
wanted us to know what you did.

38:34.112 --> 38:35.213
Right?

38:35.313 --> 38:37.248
That's why you posted
that video.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.585
That wasn't for you.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.286
Okay.

38:41.387 --> 38:42.888
Who was it for?

38:43.989 --> 38:45.457
You wouldn't understand.

38:45.557 --> 38:48.159
Hey, hey. Hey, try me.

38:48.259 --> 38:50.228
Try me. Come on.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.998
Talk to me. I've seen a lot
of things on this job, man.

38:53.098 --> 38:55.467
We can talk.
We can talk this through.

38:56.902 --> 38:57.969
It's just us, man.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.037
Talk to me.

38:59.137 --> 39:00.872
Peter. Come on, man.

39:00.972 --> 39:02.941
We can talk.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.576
Hey, Peter, don't
worry about them.

39:04.676 --> 39:05.844
Peter.

39:05.944 --> 39:06.945
It's just us.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.146
Peter, talk to me.

39:08.246 --> 39:09.415
No, no.

39:09.515 --> 39:10.582
Peter, don't worry.
It's just us, man.

39:10.682 --> 39:11.583
Hold on.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.353
Hey, hey, Peter,
stay with me. No. No!

39:30.335 --> 39:31.770
<i>After all that,</i>

39:31.870 --> 39:35.206
Albert or whatever
his name was,

39:35.306 --> 39:36.475
he's gone?

39:36.575 --> 39:39.678
Do CSIs always come
around like this,

39:39.778 --> 39:41.613
after the fact?
No.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.915
But, um...

39:44.950 --> 39:46.552
...I think this belongs to you.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.621
I'll tell you this.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.890
Trauma has a way
of bubbling up

39:51.990 --> 39:53.024
when we think
it's buried.

39:53.124 --> 39:54.560
Albert, the guy
you knew as Messy,

39:54.660 --> 39:57.162
had been beaten on
his whole life.

39:57.262 --> 39:58.830
It doesn't
make sense.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.766
But he changed his identity
to get as close

40:00.866 --> 40:03.268
as he could to a man
he looked up to.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.937
I think he really idolized him.

40:06.037 --> 40:07.372
Yeah, a lot of people did.

40:07.473 --> 40:08.907
I think that he
was not prepared

40:09.007 --> 40:11.643
to handle the truth
about who he really was

40:11.743 --> 40:13.011
and how he treated people.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.546
Probably not.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.081
You know, Damien,

40:16.181 --> 40:18.416
I think you and I
came up the same way.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.351
Except I was
on the basketball courts.

40:20.452 --> 40:22.420
And every coach
I ever had...

40:23.254 --> 40:24.990
...they'd just push me.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.325
'Cause I had something,
something they needed.

40:28.159 --> 40:30.128
And then when I became
a coach...

40:31.296 --> 40:34.432
...I-I did the exact same thing.

40:34.533 --> 40:35.801
What happened?

40:35.901 --> 40:38.336
Veronica Butler.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.571
Who's that?

40:39.671 --> 40:41.372
A player
who burned out and quit.

40:41.473 --> 40:45.410
She was the best
college player I ever saw.

40:45.511 --> 40:47.012
And you might
know her name

40:47.112 --> 40:50.048
if it weren't for me
just pushing her so hard.

40:50.148 --> 40:52.518
You know,
it costs a lot

40:52.618 --> 40:55.020
to get good at something.

40:56.087 --> 40:58.990
And it costs more

40:59.090 --> 41:01.392
to become a good leader.

41:01.493 --> 41:04.329
Heavy is the head.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.468
Good luck, young man.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.704
Come on.

41:39.565 --> 41:41.199
Mm.
