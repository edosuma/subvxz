YOU TOUCH THEM AGAIN,
THEY GO BACK TO BEING DEAD,

THE REWARD?

Narrator:
AT THIS VERY MOMENT,

00:45.958 --> 00:50.572
YOUNG NED WAS 9 YEARS, 34 WEEKS,
12 HOURS, AND 54 MINUTES OLD.

00:50.615 --> 00:55.098
HE WAS A GIFTED BOY -- NOT
ACADEMICALLY, NOR ATHLETICALLY.

00:55.142 --> 00:58.884
HE WAS GIFTED IN A WAY
NO OTHER BOY WAS GIFTED.

00:58.928 --> 01:01.235
YOUNG NED COULD TOUCH
DEAD THINGS

01:01.278 --> 01:03.106
AND BRING THEM BACK TO LIFE.

01:03.150 --> 01:07.284
BUT IF HE TOUCHED THE DEAD THING
TWICE, IT DIED AGAIN...

01:07.328 --> 01:09.678
FOREVER.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.204
THE CONSEQUENCE OF NOT TOUCHING
A DEAD THING TWICE

01:14.248 --> 01:16.250
WAS AS CRUEL AS ANY CONSEQUENCE,

01:16.293 --> 01:19.514
AND THAT WAS
SOMETHING ELSE HAD TO DIE.

01:21.907 --> 01:24.301
YOUNG NED RATIONALIZED
THIS CONSEQUENCE

01:24.345 --> 01:25.737
WAS BEYOND HIS CONTROL.

01:25.781 --> 01:28.740
HE WAS NOT TO BLAME.

01:28.784 --> 01:32.135
BUT TO REMAIN BLAMELESS,
HE HAD TO UNDERSTAND.

01:39.577 --> 01:43.494
HE REALIZED TO GIVE LIFE,
HE HAD TO TAKE IT.

01:43.538 --> 01:46.628

HAD A GRACE PERIOD.

01:46.671 --> 01:51.198
WHAT YOUNG NED DID NOT KNOW WAS
HOW LONG THAT GRACE PERIOD WAS.

01:53.504 --> 01:54.897

01:57.117 --> 01:59.380
FEARING THE CONSEQUENCES
OF HIS ACTIONS,

01:59.423 --> 02:03.688
NED VOWED TO NEVER, EVER AGAIN
BRING THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE

02:03.732 --> 02:05.908
FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE...

02:05.951 --> 02:09.216

02:09.259 --> 02:13.916

ENTERED POPULAR CULTURE IN 1911.

02:13.959 --> 02:18.747

IT CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN HEAVEN.

02:18.790 --> 02:21.793
IF YOU'RE CRAVING SOMETHING
BEFORE YOU DIE,

02:21.837 --> 02:25.101
I RECOMMEND WHERE THE PIE MAKER
MAKES HIS PIES.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.016
BUT IF YOU'RE LIKE CHUCK,

02:27.059 --> 02:30.193
YOU MAY ENJOY THE PIE
EVEN AFTER YOU DIE.

02:32.500 --> 02:36.286

SOMEONE ELSE HAD TO DIE.

OF THIS FACT.

02:39.550 --> 02:42.205
SHE WAS ALIVE AGAIN.
THAT WAS THAT.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.902

DO I CELEBRATE?

02:43.946 --> 02:45.600

02:45.643 --> 02:47.645

THE FIRST DAY I WAS ALIVE AGAIN.

LESS EXPLANATION.

02:55.349 --> 02:56.785

02:56.828 --> 02:58.613

KISSES ON HIS CHEEK,

02:58.656 --> 03:00.180
AND HE WAS HOLDING A SIGN
SAYING,

03:00.223 --> 03:02.007
"BE KIND TO ANIMALS.
KISS A BEAVER."

03:02.051 --> 03:04.793

...AND GAVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.143
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING AWAY?VERTIGO -- DIZZY.

09:39.187 --> 09:41.015
THE ROOM STARTED SPINNING,
AND I, UH --

09:41.058 --> 09:42.451

THEY'RE, UH, STIFF, AND
THEY PINCH, AND I, UH --

09:44.235 --> 09:46.194
I THINK THEY'RE CUTTING OFF
MY CIRCULATION.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.544
THAT WAS MEAN. THAT WAS
A VERY MEAN THING YOU DID.REALLY?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.764
'CAUSE "FUTURE ME" IS HERE NOW,
AND HE'S GOT SOMETHING TO SAY.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.722
BUT YOU DIDN'T TOUCH HIM.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.942
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
FIND OUT WHO KILLED HIM
IF YOU DIDN'T TOUCH HIM?

09:54.985 --> 09:56.596
ALREADY KNOW
WHO KILLED HIM.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.075
SO THE MYSTERIOUS PART
IS HOWHE WAS KILLED.

09:58.119 --> 09:59.511
ALREADY KNOW THAT, TOO.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.209
OKAY, HOW WAS HE KILLED,
AND WHO WAS THE KILLER?

THE PIE MAKER'S EYE TWITCHED

10:05.300 --> 10:07.998
IN ANTICIPATION OF THE LIE
HE WAS ABOUT TO TELL,

10:08.042 --> 10:10.653
BUT, INSTEAD,
WHAT HE TOLD WAS THE TRUTH.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.829

10:14.526 --> 10:16.354

THAT'S WHY SOMEBODY DIED.PLEASE STOP TALKING.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.843
YOU DIDN'T WHAT?

10:26.887 --> 10:28.540
LOOKY HERE, YOU NEED A TICKET
TO RIDE THIS RIDE.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.020
IF YOUR TICKET GETS PUNCHED,

10:30.064 --> 10:31.848
THEN YOU GOT TO TAKE
SOMEBODY ELSE'S TICKET.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.502
WHY ARE YOU STILL TALKING?I'M RIPPING OFF
THE BAND-AID.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.460
I'M NOT A RIPPER -- I PULL UP
A CORNER A LITTLE AT A TIME,

10:35.504 --> 10:37.680
THEN I RUN IT UNDER WARM WATER,
AND I PULL IT UP A LITTLE MORE.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.682
IT'S A PROCESS.LET IT RIP.

10:39.726 --> 10:43.077
I DIDN'T ACTIVELY KILL.
I'M NOT AN ACTIVE KILLER.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.382
I'M NOT A KILLER.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.515
YOU KILLED SOMEONE
FOR ME?

10:46.558 --> 10:49.300
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.
IT'S A RANDOM PROXIMITY THING.

10:49.344 --> 10:52.042
THERE WAS NO CHOICE OR
DECISION-MAKING WHATSOEVER.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.130
IT JUST HAPPENED.

10:53.174 --> 10:54.958
BUT YOU KNEW
IT WOULD HAPPEN.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.308
I WAS INCAPACITATED
WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO THINK.

10:57.352 --> 10:59.528
I HAD ONE THOUGHT IN MY HEAD,
AND IT WAS OF YOU,

10:59.571 --> 11:01.399
AND IT CLOGGED ME UP SO NO OTHER
THOUGHTS COULD GET THROUGH,

11:01.443 --> 11:03.227
INCLUDING THE ONE TELLING ME
TO TOUCH YOU AGAIN.

11:03.271 --> 11:04.838

11:18.199 --> 11:19.722
A NEUTRAL THOUGHT,
I WOULD SAY.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.681
IT'S NEITHER COMPLIMENTARY
NOR CRITICAL.

11:21.724 --> 11:24.379

GIVES ME PAUSE.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.468

OF THE CONVERSATION,

WHAT IF IT WASN'T HEART FAILURE?

17:43.671 --> 17:45.629
WHAT IF HIS BROTHER
WAS MURDERED?

17:45.673 --> 17:47.457
WHAT IF,

ADDRESSED TO LAWRENCE SCHATZ,
THREATENING HIS LIFE,

17:50.112 --> 17:52.071
ONE OF THEM WAS A PROMISE?

17:53.507 --> 17:55.378
WHAT IF HIS BROTHER
WAS MURDERED,

17:55.422 --> 17:57.859

SITTING THERE, BEING PRETTY,

39:49.561 --> 39:52.564
WITH NO ONE TO TOUCH IT,
HAD BEEN TOUCHED,

39:52.607 --> 39:56.002
FILLED WITH WATER,
AND PACKED WITH COFFEE GROUNDS.

39:58.700 --> 40:02.661
FOR THE TIME BEING, THE ROMANTIC
GESTURE WAS LOST ON OLIVE.

40:02.704 --> 40:05.185
HER ESPRESSO
WAS MUCH TOO BITTER,

40:05.228 --> 40:07.796
BUT THIS WOULD NOT BE
HER LAST CUP.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.320
NOT BITTER AT ALL
WAS EMERSON COD.

40:10.364 --> 40:13.454
HE LEARNED A LESSON
FROM THE BROTHERS SCHATZ.

40:13.498 --> 40:16.892
IT WASN'T WHAT HE HAD GAINED.
IT WAS WHAT HE WANTED TO LOSE.

40:16.936 --> 40:19.460
HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAD
THE LIFE THEY LED --

40:19.504 --> 40:22.855
NOT TO SAY HE NO LONGER WANTED
TO MAKE A LIVING OFF THE DEAD.

40:22.898 --> 40:25.988
HE MADE A DECISION WHILE WEDGED
IN THE WINDOW THAT DAY

40:26.032 --> 40:27.990
NEVER TO BE WEDGED AGAIN.

40:34.257 --> 40:37.130
AT THAT SAME MOMENT,
LILY AND VIVIAN CHARLES

40:37.173 --> 40:39.524
WERE ENJOYING
A WEDGE OF HAPPINESS

40:39.567 --> 40:42.135
WITH GRUYèRE
BAKED INTO THE CRUST.

40:44.877 --> 40:46.574
Woman:
WOODRUFF WAS CHARGED TODAY

40:46.618 --> 40:48.620
FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT
IN THE DEATH OF LOUIS SCHATZ --

40:48.663 --> 40:51.187
KEY PLAYERS
IN THE GRAVE-ROBBING SCANDAL.

40:51.231 --> 40:53.799
Narrator: THE GIFT OF LIFE
CHUCK HAD BEEN GIVEN

40:53.842 --> 40:56.062
WAS, INDEED,
THE GIFT THAT KEPT GIVING.

40:56.105 --> 40:58.412
SHE WENT ABOUT MATCHING
HATE MAIL WITH HEIRLOOMS

40:58.456 --> 41:01.720
AND REGIFTING THEM
TO THEIR RIGHTFUL HEIRS,

41:01.763 --> 41:05.463
LIKE SHE HAD BEEN REGIFTED
TO THE PIE MAKER.

41:06.594 --> 41:08.378
I WOULD DO IT AGAIN.
HMM?

41:08.422 --> 41:10.729
OH, I THINK IT'S NICE
THE WAY IT IS.

41:10.772 --> 41:12.034
NO.

41:13.122 --> 41:15.385
I MADE A CHOICE,
AND I WOULD DO IT AGAIN.

41:15.429 --> 41:17.823
I LET LAWRENCE SCHATZ DIE,
AND IF I WAS FACED

41:17.866 --> 41:20.347
WITH THAT CHOICE RIGHT NOW,
I WOULD MAKE THE SAME CHOICE.

41:20.390 --> 41:21.870
YOU COULD PUT ME IN A LOOP,

41:21.914 --> 41:23.785
AND I WOULD MAKE
THE SAME CHOICE EVERY TIME.

41:23.829 --> 41:26.788
THAT'S HOW CONFIDENT I
AM THAT IT WAS THE RIGHT
CHOICE FOR ME TO MAKE.

41:26.832 --> 41:31.053
I'M SORRY IF THAT MAKES ME
A BAD PERSON, BUT...

41:31.097 --> 41:33.752
I'M NOT SORRY
THAT YOU'RE ALIVE.

41:33.795 --> 41:35.667
I LIKE THAT YOU MADE
THAT CHOICE,

41:35.710 --> 41:38.017
AND THE FACT THAT YOU DID IT
ON PURPOSE --

41:38.060 --> 41:40.628
WELL, IT MAKES IT FAR MORE FUN
THAN IF YOU DID IT BY ACCIDENT.

41:46.634 --> 41:50.159
I'M GONNA SEE IF I'VE GOT
SOME PLASTIC WRAP.

41:50.203 --> 41:51.987
MMM.
