Jonah:
Mr. Joseph was acting weird
for the inspectors...

00:24.834 --> 00:26.134
Ah, fuck, Sir.
Listen, dickhead,

00:26.234 --> 00:28.267
I'm gonna hit you
so fucking hard

00:28.367 --> 00:29.967
you won't be able to shit
for a month, you hear me?

00:30.067 --> 00:32.134
...but I made him act
normal again.

00:32.234 --> 00:34.100
( boys laughing )
Fuck off, Sir.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.834
Oh, fuck.
Sharpest shit out, ay.

00:35.934 --> 00:37.967
Jonah:
George from "The Soldierz"
gave us a machete

00:38.067 --> 00:39.500
'cause we were really brave...

00:39.600 --> 00:40.834
George:
All right, get up, get up.
Go, go, go.

00:40.934 --> 00:42.134
( tires screech, horn honks )

00:42.234 --> 00:43.467
Sorry, car.

00:43.567 --> 00:45.334
...and we did
something really bad

00:45.434 --> 00:47.234
that got us into
a lot of trouble.

00:47.334 --> 00:48.934
We ended up in juvie.

00:49.034 --> 00:51.034
All jewelry off,
into the trays.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.434
Jonah:
The Fobba-liscious boys
went home.

00:52.534 --> 00:53.900
Hey, Jonah.
Boys, boys--

00:54.000 --> 00:55.134
Fuck off, I'm saying
goodbye to him.

00:55.234 --> 00:56.467
Jonah:
Fobba-liscious, boys!

00:56.567 --> 00:58.667
But me and Moses
had to stay in...

00:58.767 --> 01:00.434
We save space anyway.

01:00.534 --> 01:02.600
Hey, what's going on in here?
We're not sharing cells.

01:02.700 --> 01:03.867
Out.

01:03.967 --> 01:05.367
...until Moses
got sent home, too.

01:05.467 --> 01:06.334
Moses!

01:06.434 --> 01:07.800
Moses:
I don't want to go!

01:07.900 --> 01:08.900
I don't want him to go, Miss.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.100
Fuck off me!

01:10.200 --> 01:11.467
Jonah:
Now I have to stay in juvie

01:11.567 --> 01:14.000
for a whole six weeks
by myself.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.200
Why did the boy eat the poo?

01:16.300 --> 01:17.600
'Cause he thought
it was a chocolate bar.

01:17.700 --> 01:18.800
Night, mate.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.434
Sorry for calling you
a fat bitch.

01:21.534 --> 01:22.800
And a ranga.

01:24.267 --> 01:27.200
( theme music playing )

01:39.967 --> 01:42.100
( clicks, thuds )

01:42.200 --> 01:44.700
( monkey chattering )

01:47.634 --> 01:50.167
( reggae music playing )
* Oh, I think that I found

01:50.267 --> 01:52.534
* Myself a cheerleader

01:52.634 --> 01:57.134
* She is always right there
when I need her *

01:57.234 --> 02:00.234
* Oh, I think
that I found myself... *

02:00.334 --> 02:03.700
Kris:
Well, Jonah's been on our minds
and in our prayers for weeks.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.767
We all miss him very much.

02:05.867 --> 02:08.600
He is going to sit in front
of the parole committee

02:08.700 --> 02:11.934
this Friday.
So fingers crossed he gets
released.

02:12.034 --> 02:14.267
I've been liaising
with his legal aid lawyer,

02:14.367 --> 02:18.034
and the situation is that if
he gets done for armed robbery

02:18.134 --> 02:20.867
he'll stay in there
for a minimum of nine months.

02:20.967 --> 02:23.034
So we're really hoping
they're lenient.

02:23.134 --> 02:25.634
We have "Feel Da Beat"
in the next couple weeks

02:25.734 --> 02:28.400
and the other boys
really want Jonah there,

02:28.500 --> 02:30.400
and he's an important part
of the team.

02:30.500 --> 02:34.700
Um, and being in there,
it's not easy.

02:34.800 --> 02:38.134
Jonah acts tough,
but he's way too fragile
to survive in there.

02:38.234 --> 02:40.567
Oh, bullshit.
He can handle it.

02:40.667 --> 02:41.900
Well, we want him out,
and that's the point.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.900
So we're all praying.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.500
Joseph:
Oh, I wouldn't exactly say
that I've missed him.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.667
I've certainly noticed
he's not there.

02:49.767 --> 02:52.134
It's a lot quieter
around the place without him,

02:52.234 --> 02:54.400
and, you know, there's
a lot less headaches.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.934
His little crew miss him.

02:57.034 --> 03:00.134
In fact, they're just down right
bored shitless without him.

03:00.234 --> 03:02.400
Hey, Sir, Jonah wants
to ask you a question.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.300
Joseph:
Catholic Education
have been on my back

03:04.400 --> 03:07.667
about closing down
Lazarus house.

03:07.767 --> 03:10.800
The paperwork I've got to do
to prove it's value-- fuck me.

03:10.900 --> 03:15.100
It doesn't exactly help with
one of your pupils in juvie.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.767
Sir.
( boys protesting )

03:16.867 --> 03:18.967
Joseph:
My head's definitely
on the block.

03:19.067 --> 03:22.667
( sighs )
Jonah? Well...

03:22.767 --> 03:26.134
yeah I suppose I do
miss the prick a bit.

03:26.234 --> 03:28.234
Must be terrible being
locked up in there.

03:28.334 --> 03:29.867
( hip hop music playing )
I can't imagine he's having

03:29.967 --> 03:30.834
too much fun.

03:30.934 --> 03:32.434
* That's right

03:32.534 --> 03:34.367
* 2Koo's in the building

03:34.467 --> 03:36.467
* Go get your cameras out

03:36.567 --> 03:39.234
* Yeah, man,
'cause we look good *

03:39.334 --> 03:40.634
* You feel me?

03:40.734 --> 03:43.767
* Take a picture,
I'm looking good *

03:43.867 --> 03:47.100
* Take a picture,
what's up? *

03:47.200 --> 03:49.934
* Take a picture,
I'm too cool... *

03:50.034 --> 03:51.067
Jonah:
Yeah, I love juvie.

03:51.167 --> 03:52.634
It's mean as.

03:52.734 --> 03:54.567
The food's good,
the boys are good,

03:54.667 --> 03:57.167
there's lots
of fun things to do.

03:57.267 --> 03:58.800
These are my main boys.

03:58.900 --> 04:02.100
This is my crew inside and
we're called "Juve-liscious."

04:02.200 --> 04:04.100
Boys, show them the "J."

04:04.200 --> 04:05.334
This is our symbol.

04:05.434 --> 04:07.067
It's a "J"
for "Juve-liscious."

04:07.167 --> 04:10.367
All:
Juve-liscious.

04:10.467 --> 04:11.934
Jonah:
These boys--
we're good at dancing,

04:12.034 --> 04:13.200
good at singing.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.500
All:
* I'm your island boy

04:14.600 --> 04:16.500
* I'll kill a horse
for you *

04:16.600 --> 04:19.534
* And we could
eat it together *

04:19.634 --> 04:22.500
* Pretty young girl,
I want to touch your boobies *

04:22.600 --> 04:26.200
* Island girl, let me
touch your boobies... *

04:26.300 --> 04:28.767
Jonah:
Everyone respects us,
except for the Abos.

04:28.867 --> 04:30.800
You're not even black, bruz,
so why even act like it?

04:30.900 --> 04:32.367
( scoffs )
Your dick's not black.

04:32.467 --> 04:34.634
( Juve-liscious laughing )
Jarrod: Yeah, you reckon?

04:34.734 --> 04:36.600
How about you show me
and the boys how to crack
open a coconut?

04:36.700 --> 04:38.367
Why don't you boys
go marry yourselves?

04:38.467 --> 04:40.000
( Juve-liscious laughing )

04:40.100 --> 04:41.600
Why don't you go commit
suicide to yourself?

04:41.700 --> 04:44.367
Because your mom
wants to lick my balls.

04:44.467 --> 04:45.767
She told me when
she came to visit.

04:45.867 --> 04:47.667
( laughing )
So if I kill myself,

04:47.767 --> 04:49.234
she can't lick 'em.

04:49.334 --> 04:51.734
Jonah:
The main Abo
that I hate is Jarrod.

04:51.834 --> 04:55.134
Jarrod's a cockhead.
We always have arguments.

04:55.234 --> 04:57.334
And the other boy
I don't like is Louis.

04:57.434 --> 05:00.034
He's this big, fat Fob.
And he's scary as

05:00.134 --> 05:03.867
and he's got no sense of humor.
Hey, Jonah,
how's Kylie going?

05:03.967 --> 05:05.834
Don't know.
How's your dick going?

05:05.934 --> 05:08.734
Fuck up. You better cover that
fucked up face of yours tonight.

05:08.834 --> 05:10.600
I'm gonna stab you
in between the eyes,
you dumb fuck.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.100
Sorry, Louis.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.200
I've made up my own
secret code language.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.434
So you add a "ch"
in front of words.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.067
No one knows
what you're saying

05:19.167 --> 05:20.300
and you get away with it.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.734
You know what, Jonah?
This is you--

05:21.834 --> 05:23.067
( giggling )

05:23.167 --> 05:25.034
Chuck chou,
you big chunt.

05:25.134 --> 05:27.334
( boys laughing )

05:28.967 --> 05:32.200
Why don't you go
chill yourchelf?

05:32.300 --> 05:34.134
Why don't all you
chaborigines chiss off?

05:34.234 --> 05:35.734
( laughing )

05:35.834 --> 05:37.534
This is the uniform
that we all have to wear,

05:37.634 --> 05:40.400
but you can pimp it up with
your own style if you want to.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.667
And so this is what I do
to look skux as.

05:43.767 --> 05:47.167
I roll this shin up,
I do high socks like this,

05:47.267 --> 05:49.100
I pull my straps over
as far as you can

05:49.200 --> 05:50.867
so you get this,

05:50.967 --> 05:53.634
and then I tie
my hoodie over

05:53.734 --> 05:55.734
and I tie a little knot
in the middle here.

05:55.834 --> 05:57.934
And when you want
to work out where
the middle is,

05:58.034 --> 05:59.634
you work out where
your nipples are.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.567
In between that exactly
is the middle.

06:02.667 --> 06:03.934
Take this shit off.

06:04.034 --> 06:05.567
Jonah's voice:
Some of the younger boys,

06:05.667 --> 06:07.467
they want to look like me,
they see me walking round,

06:07.567 --> 06:11.334
so I offer my service
to make them look like me.

06:11.434 --> 06:15.000
So I show them how to get
the natural swag that I have.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.367
All:
Juve-liscious!

06:18.467 --> 06:20.834
My cell is a double cell.

06:20.934 --> 06:23.734
I've got bunks and I share
with this boy called Kevin.

06:23.834 --> 06:25.367
Chuck this in
the laundry.

06:25.467 --> 06:27.000
I hate Kevin.
He's annoying as.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.534
He's so boring.

06:28.634 --> 06:31.434
He's, like, really fat,
and he wears glasses,

06:31.534 --> 06:33.867
and he farts during the night.

06:33.967 --> 06:36.400
Kevin, you didn't make my bed.
Come down.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.067
I can't be fucked
doing it.

06:40.867 --> 06:43.167
Hey, Kevin,
stand up.

06:43.267 --> 06:44.267
I just wanna
tell you something.

06:44.367 --> 06:46.800
What? ( groans )
Get up.

06:46.900 --> 06:50.134
And do you know what?
He's so fat, that I'm scared

06:50.234 --> 06:52.534
he's gonna collapse
on me one night,

06:52.634 --> 06:55.267
so sometimes
I wake up terrified.

06:55.367 --> 06:58.667
If you fart during the night,
I'll punch you in the dick.

06:58.767 --> 06:59.867
Do you hear me?

06:59.967 --> 07:02.034
Yes.

07:02.134 --> 07:04.234
*
( boys chattering )

07:04.334 --> 07:06.734
Jonah:
I've got "Feel Da Beat"
area heats coming up

07:06.834 --> 07:09.167
so I've been practicing
my dance moves in the yard

07:09.267 --> 07:11.434
and getting ready
for when I get out.

07:11.534 --> 07:13.500
Jarrod:
Hey, what's that for?

07:13.600 --> 07:14.734
None of your business.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.034
Well, you tell me or
I'll just tell the guards

07:16.134 --> 07:18.234
about your tagging.
Simple.

07:18.334 --> 07:21.534
"Feel Da Beat" area heats,
next week with my boys

07:21.634 --> 07:22.834
when I get out.

07:22.934 --> 07:23.867
Jarrod:
You ain't getting out, bruz.

07:23.967 --> 07:25.067
You're in here for a while.

07:25.167 --> 07:26.067
I can tell just
by looking at you.

07:26.167 --> 07:28.034
Why don't you chuck choff?

07:28.134 --> 07:29.334
Seriously.

07:29.434 --> 07:30.500
Jarrod:
What the fuck does that mean?

07:30.600 --> 07:32.067
Chust chuck choff,
chaborigines.

07:32.167 --> 07:33.634
Go chuck yourselves.

07:33.734 --> 07:36.034
All right,
gardening duty, guys.
Let's move it.

07:36.134 --> 07:37.400
( boys clamoring )
Jonah: Oh, Miss!

07:37.500 --> 07:39.167
Miss, pick me, please.
Pick us boys, Miss.

07:39.267 --> 07:40.934
Miss, please.
God, please.

07:41.034 --> 07:43.200
( clamoring )
Guys, shh, shh.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.667
Only looking for people
on their best behavior.

07:45.767 --> 07:49.867
Please pick us, Miss!
I love you, Miss!

07:49.967 --> 07:52.167
I love you, Miss!
I'm not choosing anybody
until everybody's quiet.

07:52.267 --> 07:53.867
Jonah: We love you,
Miss. Miss.
Shh.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.267
Please, God, Miss.

07:55.367 --> 07:59.167
Jarrod and the guys.
( cheers and groans )

07:59.267 --> 08:01.367
Fuck you, Miss!
You always pick the Abos.

08:01.467 --> 08:03.267
We don't call them that,
do we?

08:03.367 --> 08:04.800
Indigenous.
And after the way you behaved

08:04.900 --> 08:07.034
this morning, you're lucky
I'm speaking to you at all.

08:07.134 --> 08:08.234
I didn't do anything.

08:08.334 --> 08:09.400
You called me a fat ranga

08:09.500 --> 08:11.267
and you know I don't
appreciate it.

08:11.367 --> 08:14.134
Well, you sort of
are one, Miss.
That is rude.

08:14.234 --> 08:16.300
Sorry, Miss.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.134
Go and marry your face, Miss.

08:19.234 --> 08:21.234
I want to watch TV
with you tonight.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.767
Only if you pull
your head in.

08:22.867 --> 08:24.434
Just watch TV
with me.

08:24.534 --> 08:26.500
I always ask you
and you never do it.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.134
We'll see.

08:28.234 --> 08:29.867
Thanks for not
picking me, Miss.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.334
Therese's voice:
Jonah's settled in
extremely well.

08:31.434 --> 08:32.900
A little bit too well,
actually.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.534
He's very comfortable.

08:35.634 --> 08:36.867
Hey, Miss.

08:36.967 --> 08:39.334
Miss, I've got
a stiffy.

08:39.434 --> 08:41.234
I do, Miss.
I've got a stiffy.

08:41.334 --> 08:42.800
No, I don't,
it's just a bottle.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.567
Oh, come on, somebody's
going to drink out of that.

08:44.667 --> 08:47.600
Yeah, me.
I don't even care.
It's my dick.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.800
Yeah, it is a problem
that we do face here,

08:49.900 --> 08:52.800
is that the boys become
so accustomed to life in here.

08:52.900 --> 08:56.234
And unfortunately they find
it easier to live in here

08:56.334 --> 08:58.000
than they do on the outside.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.567
Therese:
Oh, guys, who's been
graffiting on the furniture?

09:00.667 --> 09:02.767
Don't know, Miss.
Haven't seen that one before.

09:02.867 --> 09:04.134
Well, it's not on.

09:04.234 --> 09:06.667
Pens do not come out
of the learning center.

09:06.767 --> 09:08.600
I am not happy.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.134
There's some pretty naughty
boys here, Miss.

09:10.234 --> 09:11.634
You got a tough job.

09:11.734 --> 09:13.434
Therese's voice:
Jonah's a nice enough kid.

09:13.534 --> 09:15.600
Actually, it's really hard
to imagine that he could

09:15.700 --> 09:17.967
get into so much trouble
on the outside.

09:18.067 --> 09:19.967
What is the capital
of Australia?

09:20.067 --> 09:21.600
Phone:
I don't understand.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.367
Fucking thing.

09:24.467 --> 09:26.434
What is the capital
of Australia?

09:26.534 --> 09:28.534
Phone:
I don't know what that means.

09:28.634 --> 09:31.000
Fuck. It doesn't work.
It's cause
of your accent. Look.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.500
It's fucking racist,
Miss.

09:32.600 --> 09:35.800
What is the capital
of Australia?

09:35.900 --> 09:36.900
Phone:
Canberra.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.067
That's gay as, Miss.

09:39.167 --> 09:41.300
Your phone's racist.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.134
Jonah's voice:
Therese is cool.
She's my favorite guard here.

09:44.234 --> 09:45.500
Some of them are shit.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.067
But Therese, she likes
talking to me

09:48.167 --> 09:50.400
and she laughs at me.
Yeah.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.867
She's the best.
Need new shampoo.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.667
Boy: Yeah, same here.
Jonah!

09:54.767 --> 09:56.567
Jonah's voice:
And she's one
of my best friends

09:56.667 --> 09:57.667
in the whole jail.

09:57.767 --> 09:59.400
Jonah:
Hey, Miss.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.534
Guess what I'm touching
right now?

10:01.634 --> 10:03.367
I'm ju--
I'm only joking, Miss.

10:03.467 --> 10:04.934
I wasn't even
touching it.

10:05.034 --> 10:06.500
( sighs )
You're revolting.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.000
Miss, could you
shampoo my balls for me?

10:09.100 --> 10:11.267
( boys laughing )
I'm only joking.

10:11.367 --> 10:13.434
I just want you to put
the shampoo on my balls

10:13.534 --> 10:14.900
and then I'll sham--
I'll rub it in.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.200
You don't have to.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.267
Come on, Miss.
No.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.700
Come on.
You know you want to.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.867
Therese is good because she's
got the same name as my mom--

10:22.967 --> 10:24.367
Theresa.

10:24.467 --> 10:26.534
So that's why
I like her the most.

10:26.634 --> 10:28.567
All right, guys.
Start getting yourself

10:28.667 --> 10:29.867
organized for bed, please.

10:29.967 --> 10:32.300
Hey, Miss.
Miss, give me this.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.600
No.
Just give me it.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.234
Miss.

10:36.334 --> 10:38.634
Check this out, Miss.

10:38.734 --> 10:40.067
Eww.

10:41.967 --> 10:43.334
Miss, you like my earring?

10:43.434 --> 10:45.834
Oh, guys, don't forget
tomorrow is Father's Day.

10:45.934 --> 10:48.434
Make sure you get
plenty of rest.

10:48.534 --> 10:50.067
Boy:
Look at Jonah, look at Jonah.
Ohh...

10:50.167 --> 10:51.500
Oh, don't.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.300
( boys laughing )
Miss, take it off.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.934
I'm not taking
that off.

10:55.034 --> 10:56.000
No.
Please. Please.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.134
You give it to me.

10:57.234 --> 10:58.534
Put it on my bum.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.100
( laughing )

11:02.200 --> 11:03.467
All right, go in your room.
You're annoying me.

11:03.567 --> 11:06.334
Good night.
Good night, gentlemen.

11:06.434 --> 11:09.200
Guys, I said bed.
Now, please.

11:09.300 --> 11:10.500
I love you, Miss!

11:10.600 --> 11:13.800
I'm gonna dream about you!
*

11:13.900 --> 11:15.667
( clatters )
Therese: Here you go.

11:15.767 --> 11:17.534
Jonah: Good night, Miss.

11:17.634 --> 11:19.334
Jonah's voice:
Bedtime's awesome
because Miss let's me

11:19.434 --> 11:20.867
tell stories through the hatch.

11:20.967 --> 11:22.834
Boys, story time.

11:22.934 --> 11:27.500
And then the dog that had
the face of the Indian kid

11:27.600 --> 11:30.434
started growling because--
it was growling of happiness,

11:30.534 --> 11:33.400
because it saw
the lady's big boobs.

11:33.500 --> 11:37.200
And it started drooling
'cause it wanted to suck them.

11:37.300 --> 11:40.167
Shut up, Fob.
Shit story.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.900
Chut chup chourchelf,
Charrod.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.400
I just make stories up,

11:43.500 --> 11:46.400
but Miss reckons that I could
be a good author,

11:46.500 --> 11:51.200
or write books or stories
one day as a job.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.000
'Cause my stories are so good.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.734
That's when the boy chopped
his dick off,

11:55.834 --> 11:58.800
because he got so hungry
he wanted to use it as bait

11:58.900 --> 12:00.300
to catch a shark.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.267
But he forgot to put
a fishing line on it,

12:02.367 --> 12:05.034
so he just chucked it
in the ocean

12:05.134 --> 12:08.167
and a shark ate it.
And then he bled to death

12:08.267 --> 12:10.200
and died.
The end.

12:10.300 --> 12:13.434
Jonah's voice:
After story time, I get
to tell my bedtime jokes.

12:13.534 --> 12:15.467
That's everyone's
favorite bit.

12:15.567 --> 12:18.034
What did the prison cell
say to the door?

12:18.134 --> 12:19.500
Boys: What?
Fuck off.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.200
( laughing )
What did the dick
say to the shit?

12:22.300 --> 12:24.600
All: What?
Why haven't you got balls?

12:24.700 --> 12:27.134
Jonah's voice:
Juvie's boring as,
and it's pretty shit,

12:27.234 --> 12:30.000
but you can make it fun
if you try.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.667
Why did the boy
eat the tampon?
All: Why?

12:32.767 --> 12:34.800
'Cause he thought
it was a lolly.
( laughing )

12:34.900 --> 12:37.500
( reggae music playing )

12:45.867 --> 12:48.934
Uh, boys,
your dads are here.

12:49.034 --> 12:50.634
So I want you to come
and find your dad.

12:50.734 --> 12:53.434
Have a chat and show him
around the yard a little.

12:58.234 --> 13:00.300
What are you doing?

13:00.400 --> 13:02.767
Nothing.
Here for this shit.

13:04.567 --> 13:07.000
I'm supposed to show
you around, so...

13:07.100 --> 13:08.600
This is the yard.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.234
Therese:
Father's Day
is really important.

13:10.334 --> 13:11.867
Because it gives the boys
the opportunity

13:11.967 --> 13:16.634
to let their dads see
their world inside the center.

13:16.734 --> 13:18.600
It's a really important
bonding experience,

13:18.700 --> 13:21.067
because a lot of the times
the fathers actually can't

13:21.167 --> 13:23.167
make it
to the visiting hours.

13:23.267 --> 13:25.634
So having this designated
father-son time

13:25.734 --> 13:27.367
is very, very important.

13:27.467 --> 13:29.500
Oh, see them over there?
That's the Abos.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.234
They're homos.

13:32.334 --> 13:34.334
Oh, Dad, see this?
That's my tag.

13:34.434 --> 13:36.034
You're not supposed to do it.

13:36.134 --> 13:38.034
See, that's pussy
and cat.

13:38.134 --> 13:39.234
So it's pussycat.

13:39.334 --> 13:40.634
What?
Don't fucking hit me.

13:40.734 --> 13:42.534
You fucking little shit.
I'm showing you shit.

13:42.634 --> 13:44.300
I'm supposed
to show you stuff.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.767
I will show you a hiding
in a minute on your asshole.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.167
What's wrong with you?

13:48.267 --> 13:50.167
What's wrong
with your dick?

13:50.267 --> 13:51.734
This is my cell.

13:51.834 --> 13:55.867
Sink, toilet, beds,
notice board, laundry.

13:55.967 --> 13:58.967
All the shit
that you need.

13:59.067 --> 14:01.034
Who's that?

14:01.134 --> 14:02.834
Oh, that's my roommate,
Kevin.

14:02.934 --> 14:04.467
Hey, Kevin,
where's your dad?

14:04.567 --> 14:05.467
In jail.

14:05.567 --> 14:07.000
Oh.
Hm.

14:07.100 --> 14:08.700
Therese:
Jonah is loving having
his dad, Rocky, here.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.000
And drawers.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.300
He seems like
the typical Tongan father.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.100
They seem to have
a really good relationship.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.334
This is your
Father's Day present.

14:15.434 --> 14:16.434
What is it?

14:16.534 --> 14:18.034
It's a drawing
that I did of us.

14:18.134 --> 14:19.534
That's you and me.

14:19.634 --> 14:21.334
And see that gun, there?

14:21.434 --> 14:23.267
That's a cap gun.
It's not a real gun.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.567
So that's a joke.
That's why I'm smiling.

14:25.667 --> 14:26.834
You fucking little shit.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.434
You're never gonna get
a job doing that kind of shit.

14:29.534 --> 14:30.800
I don't want a job.
And you ain't gonna get

14:30.900 --> 14:32.300
to university.
What's wrong with you?

14:32.400 --> 14:33.534
I don't want to go
to university.

14:33.634 --> 14:34.967
Your dick wants
to go to university.

14:35.067 --> 14:36.367
Don't you talk
to me like that!

14:36.467 --> 14:38.034
Don't fucking touch me.
Hey, whoa, whoa whoa.

14:38.134 --> 14:39.467
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't push--
don't push me

14:39.567 --> 14:40.634
What's going on here?
I gave him his present

14:40.734 --> 14:41.767
and he pushed me, Sir.

14:41.867 --> 14:43.034
Well, what kind
of present is that?

14:43.134 --> 14:44.267
He's got a gun
on his father's head.

14:44.367 --> 14:45.334
I'll tell you what.
If this is what he--

14:45.434 --> 14:47.167
Jonah...
You teach him how to--

14:47.267 --> 14:48.400
It's Father's Day today.
This is what he's doing in here?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.267
Give him a hug.
I'm not hugging him.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.334
Give your dad
a Father's Day hug.
No way, he just hit me.

14:52.434 --> 14:53.800
Say, "Happy Father's Day."
Come on, give him a hug.

14:53.900 --> 14:55.000
Give him a hug.
I'm not saying it.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.767
I don't want
to give him a hug.

14:56.867 --> 14:59.400
I don't want to give
him a hug.
Just try to give him a hug.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.167
All I want to do
is give him a hooie.

15:01.267 --> 15:02.567
Sir, I'm not doing it.

15:02.667 --> 15:04.367
Just give him a hug
and say "Happy Father's Day."

15:04.467 --> 15:06.267
Come on.
That's the way.

15:06.367 --> 15:08.100
"Happy Father's Day."
Happy Dickhead Day.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.200
No, try it again, Jonah.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.567
"Happy Father's Day."

15:10.667 --> 15:12.134
"Happy Father's Day."
I'm not saying it.

15:12.234 --> 15:13.334
"Happy Father's Day."
Happy Dickhead Day.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.300
"Happy Father's Day."
Happy F--

15:15.400 --> 15:17.067
"Happy Father's Day."
Happy Fuckwit Day.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.200
"Happy Father's Day."
Happy Faggot Day.

15:19.300 --> 15:20.200
"Happy Father's Day," Jonah.

15:20.300 --> 15:21.834
Happy--
Fuck off me.

15:21.934 --> 15:23.034
Come on, mate,
you can do it.
Happy Father's Day.

15:23.134 --> 15:24.367
Happy Fuck Off Day.

15:24.467 --> 15:25.534
Give him a hug.
Give him a hug.

15:25.634 --> 15:26.434
"Happy Father's Day."

15:26.534 --> 15:28.100
Come on.
"Happy Father's Day."

15:28.200 --> 15:29.467
Happy Father's Day!

15:29.567 --> 15:32.600
Be nice to each other.
Get the fuck off me.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.767
You're supposed
to love me, you homo.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.400
Ryan:
Boys, take your blindfolds
and put 'em on your dads.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.467
Jonah:
Is that tight enough?
Can you see?

15:39.567 --> 15:41.200
Ryan:
Once they're on...
Be careful.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.434
How many fingers
am I holding up?

15:42.534 --> 15:44.167
...give dad a bit
of a spin around.

15:44.267 --> 15:45.567
Jonah:
Spin, spin.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.100
You have to do it,
it's Father's Day.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.334
Sucked in.
Get 'em nice and dizzy.
Right.

15:49.434 --> 15:50.534
Jonah:
Dizzy enough?

15:50.634 --> 15:52.100
Ryan:
Now, finding your own spot,

15:52.200 --> 15:54.900
guide dad with commands
like one step forward,

15:55.000 --> 15:56.200
turn to the right.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.467
Keep in mind that this is
an exercise in trust.

15:58.567 --> 16:00.867
Okay, two steps forward.
Two steps in front.

16:00.967 --> 16:02.834
Ryan:
So he's going to rely
on you guys to be his eyes.

16:02.934 --> 16:04.967
Now turn to your left.

16:05.067 --> 16:08.000
Left, idiot.
Learn English.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.967
Now, take one step backwards.

16:12.067 --> 16:14.234
And step.

16:14.334 --> 16:16.767
Two steps backwards.

16:16.867 --> 16:20.234
And now forwards
four steps.

16:20.334 --> 16:25.167
Ready, forward--
two, three, four.

16:25.267 --> 16:28.234
Hey, Dad, when are you
gonna take me back to Tonga

16:28.334 --> 16:30.200
to get my Takalua
tattoo finished?

16:30.300 --> 16:32.100
( scoffs )
When you're a real man.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.567
You're not a man.

16:33.667 --> 16:36.467
You're in jail,
you're just a little shit.

16:36.567 --> 16:38.467
You gotta prove
yourself once you're out.

16:38.567 --> 16:40.100
Then I'll decide when
you are a real man.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.400
Whatever.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.534
Take on step forward.
Turn to the right.

16:44.634 --> 16:48.034
And, Dad, see--
Uh, eight steps forward.

16:48.134 --> 16:49.534
And just go
really fast.

16:49.634 --> 16:50.900
There's nothing in front of you.
I don't want to.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.700
Go, eight steps forward.
Do it, Dad, do it.

16:52.800 --> 16:53.900
Go, eight steps forward.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.734
Go fast, Dad, go.
One, two--

16:55.834 --> 16:57.267
( thuds )

16:57.367 --> 16:59.134
Fuck!
( Jonah giggles )

17:00.534 --> 17:02.267
Come here,
you little fucking shit.

17:02.367 --> 17:03.367
It's Father's Day.
I love you, I love you.

17:03.467 --> 17:04.800
Don't hit me.
Don't hit me.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.767
Ryan:
Hey, hey, hey, Jonah.
Jonah, no running, mate.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.167
Mr. Takalua?
Mr. Takalua?

17:08.267 --> 17:10.134
Rocky:
Come here!

17:10.234 --> 17:11.367
You're in trouble.
It's a long journey.

17:11.467 --> 17:13.400
Mr. Takalua,
It's a long journey.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.767
It's a long journey, Dad.
We need to relax,

17:14.867 --> 17:16.467
and we need to be calm
and patient with him.

17:16.567 --> 17:18.367
Can we just try
to do this again?

17:18.467 --> 17:19.700
Let's just try, Dad.
Please trust each other.

17:19.800 --> 17:20.867
*
Come on, try.

17:20.967 --> 17:23.134
( upbeat music playing )

17:31.267 --> 17:33.634
Jonah:
You. They said it was
gonna be someone good.

17:33.734 --> 17:35.334
Ha ha ha.
Very funny.

17:35.434 --> 17:36.700
No, I'm serious, Sir.
I thought it was gonna be

17:36.800 --> 17:38.334
like a hot chick
or something.

17:38.434 --> 17:39.900
Look, I've got
a surprise for you,

17:40.000 --> 17:41.900
a special guest.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.500
Sir.
What the fuck am I doing here?

17:43.600 --> 17:45.234
What the fuck, Sir?
What are you doing here?

17:45.334 --> 17:46.734
Well, I thought I'd come
and see if you'd learnt

17:46.834 --> 17:48.100
your fucking lesson, eh?

17:48.200 --> 17:49.467
See what all this
prison crap's about.

17:49.567 --> 17:50.600
Fuck off, Sir.

17:50.700 --> 17:51.967
Seems pretty fucking cushy
to me so far.

17:52.067 --> 17:53.400
It's not cushy.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.200
There's bullies
everywhere, Sir.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.634
Oh, that's interesting
coming from

17:56.734 --> 17:58.567
"Mr. Schoolyard fucking Bully."
Fuck off.

17:58.667 --> 18:01.334
I think they call that karma
and I'm loving that shit.

18:01.434 --> 18:04.034
Why don't you go commit
suicide to your face, Sir?

18:04.134 --> 18:05.000
Yeah, right-o, mate.
Yeah, good.

18:05.100 --> 18:06.500
Have a seat.

18:08.134 --> 18:10.000
So, Jonah...

18:10.100 --> 18:13.267
parole hearing tomorrow,
fingers crossed, eh?

18:13.367 --> 18:15.500
I spoke to your family

18:15.600 --> 18:17.134
and they all want to come out
to pick you up,

18:17.234 --> 18:18.500
so that's exciting.

18:18.600 --> 18:19.800
Cool.

18:19.900 --> 18:22.267
You do understand that if they
look at your behavior report

18:22.367 --> 18:24.034
and your previous
criminal record

18:24.134 --> 18:25.334
and decide
to be harder on you,

18:25.434 --> 18:27.267
you could do nine to 12 months.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.800
I know, Sir.
It's fucked up.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.800
Yeah, you're a fucking idiot
for doing what you did, mate.

18:30.900 --> 18:31.900
You know that, don't you?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.267
You'll get no
sympathy from me.

18:33.367 --> 18:35.634
Shut up, Sir.
Give me sympathy.

18:35.734 --> 18:37.500
( mockingly )
"Shut up, Sir.
Give me sympathy."

18:37.600 --> 18:40.100
Fuck up.
You sound like a homo.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.234
Oh, that's interesting,
isn't it?

18:41.334 --> 18:42.434
I was trying
to sound like you.

18:42.534 --> 18:43.700
Fuck up, Sir.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.334
Kris: Look, Jonah,
we really need to get you out.

18:45.434 --> 18:46.800
Okay? We've got
"Feel Da Beat"
next week

18:46.900 --> 18:49.300
and all the boys are counting
on you being there.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.234
I've been practicing
in the yard, all the moves.

18:51.334 --> 18:52.600
I know what I'm doing.
That's good.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.400
Yeah, I'm ready for it.
That's awesome.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.067
Well, we'll be saying
a lot of prayers for you.

18:58.167 --> 19:00.067
Well, you know what, Sir?

19:00.167 --> 19:02.767
I know because I've
got my tattoo

19:02.867 --> 19:04.434
that it's gonna
protect me.

19:04.534 --> 19:07.634
And because when I was little
my mom said that I was magical,

19:07.734 --> 19:10.267
so nothing bad can
ever happen to me.

19:10.367 --> 19:12.534
So...
it's gonna be okay.

19:12.634 --> 19:14.534
That's the way.

19:14.634 --> 19:16.334
Keep up
that positive attitude, okay?

19:16.434 --> 19:18.067
We all love
and we care about you.

19:18.167 --> 19:20.100
And we just want
you back with us, all right?

19:20.200 --> 19:22.267
Are you crying, Sir?

19:22.367 --> 19:23.867
No.

19:23.967 --> 19:25.234
Sir...

19:25.334 --> 19:27.000
this might sound
like a weird question,

19:27.100 --> 19:29.300
but are you
in love with me?

19:29.400 --> 19:31.367
No, mate.
I just care about you.

19:31.467 --> 19:32.667
We all do.

19:32.767 --> 19:35.067
It seems like you're
in love with me sometimes,

19:35.167 --> 19:37.900
and just want to say
that if you are,

19:38.000 --> 19:39.400
then you should
get counseling,

19:39.500 --> 19:41.667
'cause it's not
gonna work out between us.

19:41.767 --> 19:45.234
I don't love you
in that way, mate.
I promise.

19:45.334 --> 19:47.300
Sir, you're too
Jesus-y.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.234
It's messing
with your head.

19:49.334 --> 19:50.734
Come here, mate.
Give me a hug.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.200
I'm only hugging top half.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.634
We're not touching
bottom halves.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.634
Well, I don't want
to touch your bottom half.

19:57.067 --> 19:58.567
Thanks for coming.
Righto.

19:58.667 --> 20:00.300
Give me a hug, too.
No, there's no hugging.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.234
Just give me a hug.
Just one hug.

20:02.334 --> 20:03.434
I don't do hugs.
Will you piss off?

20:03.534 --> 20:04.834
He gave me a hug.
You gotta give me a hug.

20:04.934 --> 20:05.867
Just piss off.
I don't do the hug thing.

20:05.967 --> 20:07.034
I love you.
Oh, yeah, good.

20:07.134 --> 20:08.500
Just give me a hug.
( grunting )

20:08.600 --> 20:10.300
Fuck off.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.267
(laughs)
( groans )
Fuck.

20:12.367 --> 20:13.967
You fucking nut tap me again
I'll snap your neck.

20:14.067 --> 20:16.100
And I'm not fucking kidding.
Right, you two,
knock it off.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.867
Enough. Enough.
Enough. Down.

20:18.967 --> 20:19.967
He's okay.
You all right?

20:20.067 --> 20:21.967
Fuck.
That's it?

20:22.067 --> 20:23.000
Yeah, that's it.
Right, out.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.034
Just give me a handshake.

20:24.134 --> 20:25.134
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, good.

20:25.234 --> 20:26.134
A little hug.
Get out.

20:26.234 --> 20:27.167
Jonah:
See you, Sir.

20:27.267 --> 20:28.167
See you, Jonah.

20:28.267 --> 20:30.834
( reggae music playing )

20:38.067 --> 20:40.267
( laughter, chattering )

20:48.134 --> 20:49.267
Hey, Miss.

20:49.367 --> 20:51.134
Miss, come watch
TV with me.

20:51.234 --> 20:52.834
I've saved you
a seat.

20:52.934 --> 20:54.667
Fuck off.
That's for Miss.

20:54.767 --> 20:57.167
Fucking cunt.
Jarrod: Boys,
no, stay right there.

20:57.267 --> 20:59.234
Wherever youse want.

21:03.567 --> 21:06.000
Fucking staring at me,
you coconut muncher?

21:06.100 --> 21:07.434
Go finger your own mom.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.734
Actually don't.
I already did.

21:09.834 --> 21:13.267
Miss, he just punched me.
*
I am busy, Jonah.

21:13.367 --> 21:15.500
You don't look busy.
You're just talking
shit to her.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.900
Shut the fuck up, Takalua.
I'm trying--

21:17.000 --> 21:18.300
You--
Get the fuck
off me, faggot.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.767
Jonah:
Don't put your hands
in my fucking face.

21:20.867 --> 21:23.067
You have a guard crush
on Miss Cooper, by the way.

21:23.167 --> 21:24.167
A fucking bad one.

21:24.267 --> 21:25.300
You and your little
poofter tattoo.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.734
I don't have
a guard crush.

21:26.834 --> 21:28.500
Your dick has
a guard crush.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.167
You have a guard crush, brother.
Don't deny it.

21:30.267 --> 21:31.500
I don't have
a fucking guard crush.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.167
( scoffs )

21:33.267 --> 21:34.167
I just want her
to sit next to me.

21:34.267 --> 21:35.700
You're fucking it up.

21:37.067 --> 21:38.834
Miss?

21:38.934 --> 21:40.600
Miss, please sit
next to me.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.167
Fucking cunt.

21:42.267 --> 21:43.500
Jarrod: Bye-bye.
Boy: Bye-bye.

21:45.034 --> 21:48.134
Hey, Miss, why are
you ignoring me?

21:48.234 --> 21:49.400
I have to spread
myself around.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.334
It's not all
about you, you know.

21:51.434 --> 21:52.467
Miss, give me
your hair--

21:52.567 --> 21:54.034
Now, look,
can you bugger off?

21:54.134 --> 21:56.200
Just go find
something to do.

21:56.300 --> 21:57.234
Play a game or something,

21:57.334 --> 21:58.734
Games are for homos.

22:04.900 --> 22:07.300
( soft music playing )

22:09.934 --> 22:11.600
Miss, I'm tired.

22:11.700 --> 22:13.400
Off.

22:16.334 --> 22:18.534
How are you feeling
about your hearing tomorrow?

22:18.634 --> 22:19.634
Whatever.

22:19.734 --> 22:21.034
Well you might be
getting to go home.

22:21.134 --> 22:23.067
That's pretty good news,
isn't it?

22:23.167 --> 22:26.400
Or I might be
staying here for 12 months.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.134
Well, I hope that
you get to go home.

22:28.234 --> 22:29.134
Are you looking forward
to going home?

22:29.234 --> 22:31.034
Seeing your friends?
No.

22:31.134 --> 22:32.600
Home's gay.

22:32.700 --> 22:33.967
Surely it'd have to be
more gay in here,

22:34.067 --> 22:35.534
wouldn't it?

22:35.634 --> 22:38.434
( sniffs )
No, it's good in here,
Miss.

22:38.534 --> 22:41.434
It's got good food
and everyone's nice.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.100
I like it here.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.534
What about
your tattoo?

22:47.634 --> 22:49.200
You wanted
to go back to Tonga

22:49.300 --> 22:51.367
and get that finished.
You can't do that in here.

22:51.467 --> 22:54.034
I'll just do it in 12 months
when I get out.

22:54.134 --> 22:56.934
Doesn't matter.

22:57.034 --> 22:58.334
What about if your mum
was still alive?

22:58.434 --> 23:00.967
What do you reckon
Theresa would say?

23:01.067 --> 23:02.400
Theresa...

23:02.500 --> 23:05.467
would probably want me
to stay in here.

23:05.567 --> 23:07.434
No, I think she'd want
you to go home

23:07.534 --> 23:10.134
and be free
and happy.
Nah.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.467
Miss, you're cool.

23:14.900 --> 23:17.334
Well, look, I hope
that you do get to go home,

23:17.434 --> 23:19.367
because I'm getting
transferred next week

23:19.467 --> 23:21.534
and then I wouldn't be able
to see you, anymore.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.300
That'd be pretty sucky,
wouldn't it?

23:23.400 --> 23:25.267
What's "transferred" mean?

23:25.367 --> 23:26.667
Well, it's a work transfer.

23:26.767 --> 23:28.234
It means I won't be
working here anymore.

23:28.334 --> 23:30.534
I'm gonna be at a facility
closer to home.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.267
I don't want you to go.

23:33.367 --> 23:34.734
It'll be all right.

23:34.834 --> 23:36.200
You're gonna be back
home with your family--

23:36.300 --> 23:38.467
( crying )
I think you should
stay here, Miss.

23:38.567 --> 23:39.967
I don't think you should
go anywhere.

23:40.067 --> 23:41.334
Look, how about
you go back and sit--

23:41.434 --> 23:43.267
Don't leave, Miss.
Mate...

23:43.367 --> 23:44.434
I don't want you
to go bye.

23:44.534 --> 23:45.600
Come and sit down
with the boys.

23:45.700 --> 23:46.600
Come on.
You fucking bitch.

23:46.700 --> 23:47.867
No, you're--

23:47.967 --> 23:49.300
If you go,
you're a fucking bitch.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.834
Hey, just pull your head in.
You're a fucking bitch.

23:50.934 --> 23:52.034
No, you're getting
silly now.

23:52.134 --> 23:53.300
Settle down.
You're getting silly,

23:53.400 --> 23:54.767
'cause you're
a fucking bitch.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.134
Sit down with the boys, now.

23:56.234 --> 23:58.767
Hey, Jonah, enough!
Why don't you piss off?

23:58.867 --> 24:00.734
No, you need to settle down!
I fucking told you.

24:00.834 --> 24:02.500
I don't want you
to fucking go!

24:02.600 --> 24:03.767
Therese:
Oh, fuck.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.100
( clamoring )

24:13.367 --> 24:15.734
Get off me!
Get the fuck off me!

24:15.834 --> 24:18.767
Get the fuck off me!
Fuck off!

24:18.867 --> 24:21.867
( overlapping shouting )

24:23.500 --> 24:25.167
Fuck off!

24:35.534 --> 24:37.134
Kris:
Well, we've made the drive

24:37.234 --> 24:38.500
out to Garingal Juvenile Center

24:38.600 --> 24:40.367
expecting to bring
Jonah back today.

24:40.467 --> 24:41.634
Um, but the news
that we've got

24:41.734 --> 24:43.500
has left us all
very disappointed.

24:43.600 --> 24:46.600
You didn't get
my email?
Uh, no, I didn't.

24:46.700 --> 24:48.600
Kris's voice:
He's got himself
into some serious trouble--

24:48.700 --> 24:51.167
into a fight--
and now he's in isolation

24:51.267 --> 24:53.067
and we can't even visit him.

24:53.167 --> 24:55.700
We'll let you know.
The parole committee
have cancelled the hearing.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.134
Thank you very much.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.600
I don't imagine
they'd look too favorably

24:58.700 --> 25:01.167
on an inmate causing fights
and damaging property,

25:01.267 --> 25:03.800
so he may have
stuffed himself up a bit.

25:10.567 --> 25:12.334
Jarrod:
Hey, Fob.

25:12.434 --> 25:16.000
Hey, Fobby.
Coconut Muncher!

25:16.100 --> 25:18.967
Kylie lover!

25:19.067 --> 25:20.800
Oi, tell me a joke.

25:22.634 --> 25:24.134
Oh, fuck you then.

25:25.667 --> 25:27.367
Kris:
But we're all praying hard,

25:27.467 --> 25:28.967
and we hope
to get Jonah back.

25:29.067 --> 25:30.400
He doesn't need
to be in there.

25:30.500 --> 25:31.800
He needs to be at home
with his family,

25:31.900 --> 25:33.134
who love and care for him,

25:33.234 --> 25:34.734
and all of us back at school.

25:36.767 --> 25:39.300
( soft guitar playing )

25:43.134 --> 25:45.234
Takalua Family:
* Close your eyes

25:45.334 --> 25:49.367
* Give me your hand, darling

25:49.467 --> 25:53.634
* Do you feel
my heart beating? *

25:53.734 --> 25:55.034
* Do you understand?

25:55.134 --> 25:57.234
Hey, Takalua,
is that your family?

25:57.334 --> 25:59.967
Yeah, that's my family!

26:00.067 --> 26:02.867
That's my Dad
and my Aunty Grace.

26:02.967 --> 26:05.934
And my bros.
And the fat one's my sister.

26:06.034 --> 26:08.600
Moses!

26:08.700 --> 26:10.800
Moses!

26:10.900 --> 26:12.367
I can hear you!

26:12.467 --> 26:17.900
* Meant to be...
I'm up here!
( banging )

26:18.000 --> 26:22.134
Dad! Aunty Grace!

26:22.234 --> 26:24.600
I'm up here!
I can hear you!

26:24.700 --> 26:26.900
*
Moses!

26:27.000 --> 26:28.167
You Fobs never shut up.

26:28.267 --> 26:32.567
Dad! I can hear you!

26:32.667 --> 26:37.567
Aunty! Mary!
Fatty!

26:38.534 --> 26:40.267
I'm up here!

26:42.134 --> 26:43.600
*

26:43.700 --> 26:44.800
I want to get out
for lots of reasons.

26:44.900 --> 26:46.700
I miss Mr. Joseph.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.967
Today's my last day.

26:48.067 --> 26:50.467
Moses needs me
to look after him.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.900
Oi, Pooses.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.400
You're a bitch.
Jonah:
Fuck you.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.867
I got "Feel Da Beat"
coming up...

26:55.967 --> 26:57.467
* I feel sad
I feel pain *

26:57.567 --> 27:01.167
* When you call me
that name... *

27:01.267 --> 27:03.000
...and I miss my boys.

27:03.100 --> 27:04.500
Do you reckon he's
really gonna get out today?

27:04.600 --> 27:06.834
Nah, I think Jonah's
gonna stay in.

27:06.934 --> 27:08.800
Boys!
The door's opening.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.334
Boys:
Jonah! Jonah!

27:10.434 --> 27:13.267
