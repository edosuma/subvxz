Just give me a month.
And I will prove to you

00:03.989 --> 00:06.057
- how valuable I am.
- Two weeks.

00:06.091 --> 00:08.092
Is this what we want for Toby?

00:08.127 --> 00:09.727
Manage a car wash?

00:09.762 --> 00:10.762
Congratulations.

00:13.098 --> 00:15.867
It's summer! And I'm not having any fun.

00:15.901 --> 00:17.735
- And I sound crazy... 
- No.

00:17.770 --> 00:18.636
You don't.

00:21.474 --> 00:22.574
I wanna be close to you.

00:26.278 --> 00:27.579
I gotta be honest with you.

00:27.613 --> 00:29.214
I've had a couple dreams about you.

00:29.248 --> 00:30.348
He made a pass at me.

00:30.382 --> 00:32.250
Made a pass?

00:34.487 --> 00:36.354
You stay the hell away from my wife.

No.

03:14.097 --> 03:15.998

- I'm sorry.

03:29.112 --> 03:31.147
But I have to rush off to work.

Oh, no problem. Thank
you so much for coming.

03:33.350 --> 03:34.316

- Okay.

- Bye!

03:37.287 --> 03:39.288
- Look at you! Hi!
- Mmm!

03:39.322 --> 03:42.358
Come here, you guys.
So, how's the car wash?

03:42.392 --> 03:43.959
<i>- (Door closes)
- No problems at all.</i>

03:43.994 --> 03:44.994
- Really?
- Just like you left it.

03:45.028 --> 03:46.996
- Don't even think about it.
- Oh.

03:47.030 --> 03:48.931
Which is a good thing,
since the doctor recommends

03:48.965 --> 03:51.167
that he does almost nothing for two weeks.

03:51.201 --> 03:54.303
So I made you your very own instant queue.

03:54.337 --> 03:55.404
All movies guaranteed

03:55.438 --> 03:58.073
not to raise your blood pressure.

And in a few days we can
start your workout routine.

04:01.344 --> 04:03.846
It's really slow at first.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.314
I really appreciate everything you've done,

04:05.348 --> 04:08.250
but, really, it was a
minor cardiac incident.

04:08.285 --> 04:10.853
And... 

04:10.887 --> 04:11.854
What is this?

04:11.888 --> 04:13.122
Soy cheese.

04:13.156 --> 04:15.090
Oh, wow.

04:15.125 --> 04:17.059
Also, I wanna let everybody know

04:17.093 --> 04:19.295
that we're gonna keep this under the radar.

04:19.329 --> 04:21.130
<i>Okay? The official story</i>

04:21.164 --> 04:24.033
is that I had a severe case of stomach flu.

04:24.067 --> 04:28.137
Honey, I don't think
it's a good idea to lie.

04:28.171 --> 04:30.039
Hold on a second. I'm still the new guy

04:30.073 --> 04:33.108
in the Senate, and I can't have
everyone treating me like an invalid.

04:33.143 --> 04:34.977
Right? Makes sense.

04:35.011 --> 04:37.213
So this is fantastic. Thank you so much.

04:37.247 --> 04:39.315
I just need to catch up on
that farm bill before lunch.

04:39.349 --> 04:41.083
Honey.

04:41.117 --> 04:43.085
That's not taking it easy.

04:43.119 --> 04:46.088
The only way this bill is gonna
kill me is if I die from boredom.

04:46.122 --> 04:47.990
Okay? Mwah! I'll be right back.

04:48.024 --> 04:49.959
- John!
- It's okay, it's okay.

04:52.095 --> 04:56.232
I was hoping to have a
second to check in with you.

04:56.266 --> 04:58.100
Sure.

05:01.338 --> 05:03.239
I know my trial period is

05:03.273 --> 05:07.209
almost over, and I was wondering
if everything was going... 

05:07.244 --> 05:08.978
how you had hoped.

05:09.012 --> 05:10.112
Things are going very well.

05:10.146 --> 05:13.916
You're great with customers,
you're a team player.

05:13.950 --> 05:15.241
But if I bring you on,

05:15.242 --> 05:17.662
the bulk of your income
is going to be commissions.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.121
Of course.

05:19.220 --> 05:22.189
So, you might wanna think about
bringing in some business of your own.

05:22.223 --> 05:24.124
Okay.

05:24.159 --> 05:25.259
I can do that.

05:25.293 --> 05:27.094
<i>(Footsteps approaching)</i>

05:27.128 --> 05:29.096
Good morning. Beautiful day.

05:29.130 --> 05:31.932
I just texted Mark. He said that we could

05:31.966 --> 05:34.268
reschedule the open house
if you're feeling tired.

05:34.302 --> 05:37.037
Oh, no no no no no.
I've had plenty of rest.

05:37.072 --> 05:39.139
Besides, I love talking
to the constituents.

05:39.234 --> 05:40.334
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:40.368 --> 05:44.138
All I do is read their
emails and it stresses me out.

05:44.172 --> 05:46.306
It's just a couple of hours. I'll be fine.

05:46.341 --> 05:48.375
All right, we have here

05:48.410 --> 05:51.378
one tofu scramble, especially made for... 

05:51.446 --> 05:54.381
- Senator Kennish.
- Thank you, but I... 

05:54.416 --> 05:56.917
(Chuckles) No, I... I don't do tofu.

05:56.951 --> 05:59.286
Anyway, I should be going.
Um, have you seen my keys?

05:59.320 --> 06:01.221
You're not supposed to drive.

06:01.256 --> 06:03.323
Honey, downtown's like 15 minutes away.

06:03.358 --> 06:06.226
- I'll be fine.
- Those were the doctor's orders.

06:06.261 --> 06:07.327
I can drive you there.

06:09.297 --> 06:11.265
And will you at least eat a banana?

06:11.299 --> 06:13.267
Uhh... 

06:17.305 --> 06:20.140
Aww, geez, where are you?

06:20.175 --> 06:21.275
Shoot shoot.

06:21.309 --> 06:23.110
Not this one.

06:23.144 --> 06:25.112
<i>- What's the emergency?
- (Deeply sighs)</i>

06:25.146 --> 06:28.282
I am about to put out an
A.P.B. on my left shoe.

06:28.316 --> 06:30.384
It's a... a pump. Burgundy.

06:30.418 --> 06:33.287
If only there was a way to put
your shoe in one place at night

06:33.321 --> 06:35.088
and have them be there the next morning.

06:35.123 --> 06:37.357
- (Sighs) Not helping.
- Well.

06:37.392 --> 06:39.960
- Ah, found it.
- Thank you.

06:42.263 --> 06:44.998
How about I make dinner for us tonight?

06:45.033 --> 06:48.068
Actually, uh, I was wondering

06:48.102 --> 06:50.237
if you'd be willing to have
dinner at the country club.

06:50.271 --> 06:53.207
Whitney wants me to start
bringing in new clients,

06:53.241 --> 06:56.176
and you seem to be doing so well there.

06:56.211 --> 06:58.078
So why not ask me?

06:58.112 --> 07:00.113
I mean, hello! I'm opening a restaurant.

07:00.148 --> 07:03.283
- Right!
- Barbara and I haven't talked about design yet.

07:03.318 --> 07:04.351
But we're gonna need someone.

07:04.385 --> 07:06.253
Do you think that she would be willing?

07:06.287 --> 07:08.255
I can talk to her.

07:08.289 --> 07:10.090
(Exhales) Thank you!

07:10.124 --> 07:11.992
Okay, I gotta go.

07:13.226 --> 07:14.962
<i>Toby: Hey, guys. Could you come in</i>

07:14.996 --> 07:16.663
so I can talk to you for a second?

07:16.698 --> 07:18.999
So I wanna thank you guys
for getting here early today

07:19.033 --> 07:22.669
on our first day of the home run promotion.

07:22.704 --> 07:25.572
<i>It's our busiest time of the summer,
so we gotta keep the line moving,</i>

07:25.607 --> 07:28.642
while keeping our normal high standard.

07:28.676 --> 07:31.378
Not shortcuts and no cutting corners.

07:31.412 --> 07:32.446
You know the drill.

07:40.255 --> 07:42.389
Great. Um... 

07:42.423 --> 07:43.991
let's get to it.

07:47.161 --> 07:48.829
Hey, man.

07:48.863 --> 07:50.931
Don't be on your phone.

07:51.932 --> 07:53.465
____

07:54.836 --> 07:57.738
It's the great circle of
life here at Maui, Kansas.

07:57.772 --> 08:01.675
Who will save these surfers
from their inevitable doom?

08:01.709 --> 08:03.610
Anybody.

08:03.645 --> 08:05.746
Anybody at all.

08:05.780 --> 08:08.815
You look like you could
use a pineapple freezee.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.454
Thank you.

08:14.489 --> 08:17.357
So your dad's home from
the hospital, right?

08:17.392 --> 08:18.492
He must be psyched.

08:18.526 --> 08:21.028
It's like the royals'
opening day, but on steroids.

08:21.062 --> 08:22.296
(Chuckles softly) Is he on bed rest?

08:22.330 --> 08:24.965
(Scoffs) No, he's already
at a "I need to make sure

08:24.999 --> 08:26.967
the voters really really like me event."

08:26.965 --> 08:28.999
It's almost like nothing ever happened.

08:29.033 --> 08:31.068
And what about you? You okay?

08:31.102 --> 08:34.938
I'm just happy to be somewhere
other than a hospital waiting room.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.842
Well, you still feel like coming
to that cookout on the base?

08:38.876 --> 08:40.777
Ohh, right, that.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.379
I mean, if you're not up for it,

08:42.413 --> 08:43.679
- I totally understand.
- No no, it sounds great.

08:43.715 --> 08:47.284
I could really use some fun.

08:47.318 --> 08:50.387
Well, if your curfew isn't too early... 

08:50.421 --> 08:53.090
then maybe after the cookout we can

08:53.124 --> 08:55.058
hang out in my room for a little while.

08:57.028 --> 09:00.030
Yeah. I don't think I
have to be home too early.

09:00.064 --> 09:00.998
All right.

09:01.032 --> 09:02.599
It's a date.

09:02.634 --> 09:03.667
It's a date.

09:10.742 --> 09:12.476
Senator, I'd like to talk to you

09:12.510 --> 09:14.278
about your stance on medical marijuana.

09:14.312 --> 09:16.480
I have severe glaucoma,
and I resent that you... 

09:16.514 --> 09:18.582
Excuse me, excuse me. I'm with
the federal government on this one,

09:18.616 --> 09:21.285
<i>- but thank you for stopping by.
- Oh-ho, good answer.</i>

09:22.453 --> 09:24.121
- Senator Coto.
- Hey.

09:24.155 --> 09:26.089
Nice turnout, John. Guess when you take

09:26.124 --> 09:28.025
<i>a week off, you gotta
make up for lost time.</i>

09:28.059 --> 09:29.159
Yeah, it was hardly a week off.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.861
I got something else for you.

09:30.895 --> 09:32.963
We got a charity softball
tournament in a few weeks.

09:32.997 --> 09:33.931
<i>I want you on the team.</i>

09:33.965 --> 09:35.766
You'll be our ringer.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.869
- Is that gonna be a problem?
- No problem.

09:38.903 --> 09:39.870
Good.

09:39.904 --> 09:42.639
Do you mind if I grab him?

09:42.674 --> 09:43.707
There's a bunch of
folks who wanna meet him.

09:43.741 --> 09:45.576
I do work for the people.

09:45.610 --> 09:47.544
Yeah, sure. Just take
care of yourself, John.

09:47.579 --> 09:50.447
All right? This job can really
wear you out if you're not careful.

09:50.481 --> 09:52.649
A lot of the new guys
underestimate the stress.

09:52.684 --> 09:56.219
- Chip, I'm good.
- All right.

09:56.254 --> 09:58.055
Nice seeing you, Daphne.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.898
Hey.

10:07.932 --> 10:09.933
Do you have any herbal tea?

10:09.968 --> 10:11.201
(Exhales) I'm insulted.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.904
Not just as a barista, but as a Brit.

10:13.938 --> 10:15.839
I'll take that as a "no" then.

10:15.873 --> 10:18.675
Just a Grande decaf coffee please.

10:18.710 --> 10:21.645
You know, the best way for an intern

10:21.679 --> 10:23.513
to celebrate a successful
voter meet-and-greet

10:23.548 --> 10:25.449
is going on her first official date

10:25.483 --> 10:27.684
with the finest latte maker in Kansas City.

10:27.719 --> 10:32.289
Oh! See, 'cause I thought it
was by sending follow-up e-mails.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.292
I made reservations at

10:35.326 --> 10:36.526
the new sushi restaurant on Seventh.

10:36.561 --> 10:39.997
Oh. Uh... 

10:40.031 --> 10:43.834
I should probably stay home with my dad.

10:43.868 --> 10:46.003
Didn't he come into
the office this morning?

10:47.038 --> 10:48.705
How bad was his stomach flu?

10:48.740 --> 10:50.641
He's just really bad about

10:50.675 --> 10:53.477
<i>- resting and... 
- Look, if you don't wanna hang out, that's fine.</i>

10:53.511 --> 10:54.745
No no no, I do. I just... 

10:54.779 --> 10:56.546
Don't worry about it.

10:56.581 --> 10:57.814
I'll see you later.

11:04.051 --> 11:05.751
- Regina?
- Hmm?

11:05.786 --> 11:06.852
Do you know anything about
this next appointment?

11:06.887 --> 11:09.622
Uh, Barbara Salz, Brazilian fusion.

11:09.656 --> 11:11.691
Actually, that is my first client.

11:11.725 --> 11:15.328
She is opening a new restaurant
in the power and light district.

11:15.362 --> 11:16.529
<i>- Great.
- (Door opens)</i>

11:17.664 --> 11:18.664
Can I help you?

11:18.699 --> 11:23.369
Uh, this is Angelo Sorrento.

11:23.403 --> 11:26.138
He is Barbara's partner in the restaurant.

11:26.173 --> 11:27.206
Nice to meet you.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.407
Pleasure to meet you.

11:28.442 --> 11:30.176
I'm Whitney. I own this studio.

11:30.210 --> 11:32.111
Regina has some really great ideas.

11:32.145 --> 11:34.747
I'm excited to get to work.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.083
Well, let's go to my desk.

11:38.719 --> 11:39.618
(Mouthing)

11:40.921 --> 11:42.021
This wasn't the plan.

11:42.055 --> 11:43.756
Relax.

11:54.267 --> 11:56.335
Is now a good time?

11:56.370 --> 11:57.336
Definitely.

11:57.371 --> 11:59.138
Sit down.

11:59.172 --> 12:01.307
Uh, so... 

12:01.341 --> 12:05.244
I kinda have a weird question.

12:05.278 --> 12:07.179
- What's going on?
- (Sighs deeply)

12:07.214 --> 12:11.784
Okay, I'm going to this
cookout with Ty later today,

12:11.818 --> 12:13.953
and we're probably gonna... 

12:13.987 --> 12:16.956
hang out in his room.

12:18.669 --> 12:22.472
<i>Wait, do you mean like hang out hang out?</i>

12:22.506 --> 12:25.475
For the first time ever.

12:25.509 --> 12:27.410
Oh, my God. Really?

12:27.445 --> 12:29.312
Yeah. I know.

12:29.347 --> 12:31.381
A week after my dad had a heart attack.

12:31.415 --> 12:33.983
Am I a terrible person?

12:34.018 --> 12:36.252
You're not planning on
telling John, are you?

12:36.287 --> 12:38.054
God, no.

12:38.089 --> 12:40.990
Well, then I'd say you're okay.

12:41.025 --> 12:43.993
So, uh... 

12:44.028 --> 12:46.663
does it hurt?

12:46.697 --> 12:48.832
Well... 

12:48.866 --> 12:51.468
my first time was in the boathouse

12:51.502 --> 12:53.603
and we were lying on a tarp.

12:53.637 --> 12:56.473
So it hurt my back more than anything else.

12:56.507 --> 12:58.408
A boathouse?

12:58.442 --> 13:00.377
(Chuckles) Yeah, it was at camp.

13:00.411 --> 13:03.113
He was the archery C.I.T.

13:03.147 --> 13:05.382
It was actually his first time too,

13:05.416 --> 13:07.884
so it was kinda fun

13:07.918 --> 13:09.919
figuring everything out together.

13:11.856 --> 13:14.157
Okay, but how do I know

13:14.191 --> 13:17.927
what to do? Like what to take off when?

13:17.962 --> 13:19.996
Oh, I think he'll take
care of that for you.

13:20.030 --> 13:22.699
I don't know, like what if my... 

13:22.733 --> 13:26.503
body isn't what he's expecting?

13:26.537 --> 13:29.472
Guys don't really care about that.

13:29.507 --> 13:30.740
Not like we do.

13:30.775 --> 13:32.542
They're just happy to be there.

13:32.576 --> 13:34.477
(Laughs)

13:36.180 --> 13:38.214
So does all this great advice

13:38.249 --> 13:40.083
come from some recent experience

13:40.117 --> 13:43.319
with, I don't know, maybe someone British?

13:43.354 --> 13:45.054
No.

13:45.089 --> 13:46.990
I think I kinda ruined it with him.

13:47.024 --> 13:48.124
What happened?

13:48.159 --> 13:50.126
Well, we keep making plans,

13:50.161 --> 13:52.128
but I keep having to cancel because of

13:52.163 --> 13:54.597
everything that's going on here.

13:54.632 --> 13:57.667
Look, you like this coffee guy, right?

13:57.701 --> 13:59.602
Yeah.

13:59.637 --> 14:02.772
Then make time for him.

14:07.645 --> 14:08.511
Wish me luck.

14:09.613 --> 14:10.647
Good luck.

14:44.815 --> 14:46.759
Couldn't decide between
the fried mac and cheese

14:46.760 --> 14:49.619
or the bacon and cheddar
tater tots, so I got both.

14:49.653 --> 14:50.720
- Thanks.
- Dope.

14:50.754 --> 14:52.388
Cool, where should I put these?

14:52.423 --> 14:54.491
Oh, right here. Let's eat!

appointment for a tasting

16:19.543 --> 16:21.311

16:21.345 --> 16:23.246
Off you go.

Yes, it's decaf.

Uh, just staying in
and making some Risotto.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.191

- Shuffle...

it's a game for the old

17:33.217 --> 17:34.350
Why, yes, I do.

It's a guy who wants
to tell people what kind

17:36.320 --> 17:38.254

need and get me to pay for it.

some "Game of Thrones"?

17:55.839 --> 17:57.674
And we'll let you know when it's ready.

17:57.708 --> 17:59.742
"Game of Thrones"... there
is something we can agree on.

17:59.777 --> 18:02.779
Yes! And you know why? Because it
makes sense when regimes rise... 

18:02.813 --> 18:05.548

Man, I don't know what
it is about this summer,

19:16.606 --> 19:19.475
but I've hooked up with more girls than

19:19.509 --> 19:21.443
I probably did the entire
four years I was at Buckner.

19:21.478 --> 19:23.479

Yeah, totally.

19:25.315 --> 19:27.516
Uh, so when do you head out to school?

19:27.550 --> 19:30.185
Orientation is in three weeks,

19:30.220 --> 19:32.221
but I would go up there now if they let me.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.022
Trading in K.C. for the windy city... 

19:34.057 --> 19:35.991
no parents, no curfew.

19:36.025 --> 19:37.326
It's total freedom.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.262
Man, it's like our lives
are finally starting.

19:40.296 --> 19:41.897
You know what I mean?

19:41.931 --> 19:43.699
Yeah, totally.

19:48.071 --> 19:51.006
So is it hard being a woman in the army?

19:51.040 --> 19:53.675
I don't know. I'd say it's... 

19:53.710 --> 19:55.778
generally just hard being in the army.

19:55.812 --> 19:58.380
Don't listen to her. She's
tougher than most of the guys.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.482
Well, tougher than you.

20:00.517 --> 20:02.618
Although that's not really saying much.

20:02.652 --> 20:05.587
So there's this story
about a convoy she was on.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.489
Geez! This again?

20:07.524 --> 20:10.159
Calm down. They're having
to take these civil engineers

20:10.193 --> 20:13.428
into the city, and a roadside
bomb hits one of the humvees

20:13.463 --> 20:14.396
and catches on fire.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.231
Engineers start scrambling out,

20:16.266 --> 20:17.299
but this one guy's injured.

20:17.333 --> 20:20.135
Guy weighs like 250 pounds.

20:20.170 --> 20:23.005
And he gets heavier every
time I hear this story.

20:23.039 --> 20:25.908
All right, so Aida... she
goes crawling in there,

20:25.942 --> 20:27.676
grabs the guy, drags him out.

20:27.710 --> 20:28.911
The whole time she's just got

20:28.945 --> 20:31.013
insurgents popping off shots at her.

20:31.047 --> 20:32.514
(Laughs)

20:32.549 --> 20:33.515
It's just the job.

20:33.550 --> 20:34.683
It's not just the job.

20:34.717 --> 20:35.784
You were covered in bruises.

20:35.819 --> 20:38.420
I thought that was from
hooking up with you.

20:41.658 --> 20:44.293
Briggs, I think we're running low on beer.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.128
Why don't you go get us some more?

20:53.136 --> 20:54.870
I just keep thinking

20:54.904 --> 20:57.039
"what if my mom hadn't been there?"

20:57.073 --> 20:59.775
And even if I did find
him, I couldn't save him.

20:59.809 --> 21:01.710
I don't know C.P.R.

21:01.744 --> 21:04.746
Well, I'm C.P.R. certified.

21:04.781 --> 21:08.717
When I was eight, I was at
this floating market in Bangkok.

21:08.751 --> 21:10.853
A floating market where?

21:10.887 --> 21:14.556
My parents are aid workers,
so I kinda grew up all over.

21:14.591 --> 21:17.359
Anyway, I was goofing off
at the side and I fell in.

21:17.393 --> 21:19.695
And they had a bit of a
hard time fishing me out.

21:19.762 --> 21:21.563
You don't know how to swim?

21:21.598 --> 21:24.333
But the point is I do know C.P.R.

21:24.367 --> 21:25.567
So I can save someone else.

21:25.602 --> 21:28.103
Can you teach me sometime?

21:28.137 --> 21:29.438
I can teach you now.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.116
Okay.

21:41.150 --> 21:43.919
So first thing before you do anything

21:43.953 --> 21:46.989
is check for responsiveness.

21:47.023 --> 21:49.591
Then you call 911.

21:49.626 --> 21:52.594
And then puts your hands like
this in the center of the chest,

21:52.629 --> 21:54.596
right between the, uh... 

21:55.698 --> 21:58.734
(Both laugh)

21:58.768 --> 22:01.403
and you push down about five centimeters

22:01.437 --> 22:04.373
for 30 compressions.

22:04.407 --> 22:06.475
And then it's the... 

22:06.509 --> 22:08.210
mouth-to-mouth.

22:09.379 --> 22:13.282
I think we've done
something like that before.

22:18.221 --> 22:19.221
<i>What's going on here?</i>

22:21.057 --> 22:22.891
- He's teaching me C.P.R.
- Hello, Senator.

22:22.926 --> 22:25.694
Why is he teaching you C.P.R.?

22:26.896 --> 22:28.664
I told him.

22:28.698 --> 22:30.565
I'm sorry. It just slipped out.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.434
But he won't put it on his blog.

22:32.468 --> 22:34.369
A blog... you have a blog?!

22:34.404 --> 22:35.470
Oh, Daphne.

22:35.505 --> 22:37.205
Next time just put it in the "Herald."

22:37.240 --> 22:39.141
- I'm not gonna post it.
- Yeah.

22:42.278 --> 22:43.445
Well, then.

22:43.479 --> 22:47.115
I should go up. It's time for his medicine.

22:47.150 --> 22:49.084
I can man the Risotto.

22:50.320 --> 22:53.088
Maybe we should just do this another time.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.191
He's really upset and
I have a lot of stuff... 

22:56.225 --> 22:58.927
I'm sorry your dad had a heart attack,

22:58.962 --> 23:00.796
believe me, I get it.

23:00.830 --> 23:02.998
My parents are working in Malawi.

23:03.032 --> 23:06.735
It's a battle not to spend every
second of the day worrying about them.

23:06.769 --> 23:08.537
But I have to.

23:08.571 --> 23:11.640
Because I have a life. Things I wanna do... 

23:11.674 --> 23:13.709
a girl I wanna get to know.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.446
But, hey, you're obviously

23:17.480 --> 23:18.647
living your life differently.

23:18.681 --> 23:21.450
And I know better than
to try and change that.

23:21.514 --> 23:43.476
___

23:45.597 --> 23:46.931
You were late coming back from your break.

23:46.932 --> 23:50.393
___

23:50.394 --> 23:53.586
___

23:54.123 --> 23:56.124
Just be on time, okay?

23:56.158 --> 23:59.961
<i>Don't make me be that guy.</i>

23:59.962 --> 24:02.062
___

24:02.131 --> 24:05.166
I'm trying to make this an
okay place to work, all right?

24:05.200 --> 24:07.969
I need you to be on my team.

24:08.003 --> 24:08.937
Please.

24:08.938 --> 24:12.518
___

24:12.519 --> 24:14.368
___

24:14.369 --> 24:17.037
You want this job? Take it.

24:17.938 --> 24:20.893
___

24:20.894 --> 24:23.780
___

24:26.501 --> 24:28.602
You're telling me you
wanna make work schedules

24:28.636 --> 24:31.371
and calculate expenses and all that?

24:38.446 --> 24:40.414
I'm sorry, man.

24:40.448 --> 24:42.583
I didn't realize you wanted the job.

24:42.617 --> 24:45.085
If I would have known, I wouldn't have... 

24:45.086 --> 24:49.766
___

24:59.934 --> 25:02.903
I have about 3,000 messages for you.

25:02.937 --> 25:04.037
(Chuckles)

25:04.072 --> 25:06.707
So after my lunch... 

25:06.741 --> 25:08.876
I took an impromptu meeting with Angelo

25:08.910 --> 25:11.745
and his partner to see the
space they're working with.

25:11.779 --> 25:14.448
I thought they were
tearing down and rebuilding.

25:14.482 --> 25:17.518
Oh, it's still helpful to get a
sense of size, the neighborhood.

25:17.552 --> 25:18.719
You know.

25:18.753 --> 25:21.355
Now don't worry. You
brought this project in.

25:21.389 --> 25:23.257
The commission's yours.

25:23.291 --> 25:26.193
But I do think it will
be helpful if I supervise,

25:26.227 --> 25:27.227
since this is your first go.

25:27.262 --> 25:29.296
Plus, I get a sense

25:29.330 --> 25:31.899
there's kind of a vibe between us.

25:36.004 --> 25:38.672
Do you think you can find
out if he's seeing anyone?

25:38.706 --> 25:39.907
And what his type is.

25:39.974 --> 25:42.943
I know I'm a little older
than he is, but, um... 

25:42.977 --> 25:45.479
Yeah. Sure. I'll ask.

25:45.513 --> 25:46.513
Great.

25:53.521 --> 25:54.655
What are you doing?

25:54.689 --> 25:57.558
It's okay. The doctor said
a little exercise is good.

25:57.592 --> 26:00.627
A little exercise, not
training for the Olympics.

26:02.497 --> 26:04.331
(Panting) Okay.

26:04.365 --> 26:06.433
What were you thinking telling
that guy about what happened?

26:06.467 --> 26:08.402
I told you that was private.

26:08.436 --> 26:10.337
I know. I'm sorry.

26:10.371 --> 26:12.906
It's just that you two were
going at it and I was just... 

26:12.941 --> 26:15.876
And why is he giving you C.P.R.
lessons on the kitchen floor?

26:15.910 --> 26:18.245
So I could actually be of
use if it happened again.

26:18.279 --> 26:20.113
- It is not gonna happen again.
- How do you know that?!

26:20.148 --> 26:22.082
All right, look... 

26:22.116 --> 26:25.619
I really appreciate everything
that you're doing for me.

26:25.653 --> 26:28.522
But you gotta stop treating me
like I got a foot in the grave.

26:28.556 --> 26:30.557
Okay? It is making me crazy.

26:30.592 --> 26:34.628
I just don't understand why it's such
a big deal to listen to the doctors

26:34.662 --> 26:37.297
and start taking care of yourself.

26:37.332 --> 26:39.566
Because I like eating steak

26:39.601 --> 26:41.335
and I like working out.

26:41.369 --> 26:43.370
<i>And I gotta do my job
or they're gonna fire me.</i>

26:43.404 --> 26:46.139
Okay? And I'm not gonna
go into hibernation.

26:46.174 --> 26:49.076
And I am not gonna start
eating tofu at every meal.

26:49.110 --> 26:51.178
Why not? Aren't we worth it?

26:51.212 --> 26:54.214
Isn't being here worth every
sacrifice you have to make?

26:54.249 --> 26:56.250
Oh, come on. (Exhales)

26:56.284 --> 26:58.919
Okay, you know what? You're right.

26:58.953 --> 27:00.887
It's your life.

27:00.922 --> 27:03.757
Your pills are there if you want them.

27:03.791 --> 27:06.026
<i>- (Sighs deeply)
- Ty: Hey, where you going?</i>

27:06.060 --> 27:07.961
Home.

27:07.996 --> 27:09.863
How you getting home?

27:09.897 --> 27:12.699
I don't know, maybe you and
Aida can take me back in a tank.

27:14.602 --> 27:15.736
Bay.

27:15.770 --> 27:18.305
I cannot believe that
you dragged me to a picnic

27:18.339 --> 27:19.640
with your ex-girlfriend, G.I. Jane.

27:19.674 --> 27:21.541
Okay, I didn't know Aida was gonna be here

27:21.576 --> 27:23.343
and she's not my ex-girlfriend.

27:25.346 --> 27:27.281
So you two never hooked up?

27:27.315 --> 27:30.050
No, we did.

27:30.084 --> 27:31.251
But she wasn't my girlfriend.

27:31.286 --> 27:33.053
Oh.

27:33.087 --> 27:34.921
Well, that makes it much better.

27:34.956 --> 27:37.090
Look, why should I feel bad
about being with somebody else?

27:37.125 --> 27:38.825
We weren't dating, Bay.

27:38.860 --> 27:41.728
In fact, I called you and you
told me you were with Emmett,

27:41.763 --> 27:43.063
and you don't see me
freaking out about that.

27:43.097 --> 27:45.766
But I didn't have sex with Emmett.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.901
I haven't had sex with anyone.

27:49.771 --> 27:51.371
Wait, what?

27:52.607 --> 27:53.573
Forget it.

27:53.608 --> 27:54.708
No. Why didn't you tell me that?

27:54.742 --> 27:56.576
Look, I just wanna go home.

27:56.611 --> 27:59.279
Okay, if you'll hang on a
second. Let me just grab my keys.

27:59.314 --> 28:01.214
I already called Regina. She's on her way.

28:13.232 --> 28:14.999
That ended early.

28:15.034 --> 28:16.234
Yep.

28:17.970 --> 28:18.836
(Sighs deeply)

28:20.873 --> 28:22.907
Am I crazy for trying to make this work?

28:22.941 --> 28:25.777
Did something happen?

28:25.811 --> 28:28.446
No, it's just... 

28:28.480 --> 28:32.383
I have no idea what Ty's doing with me.

28:32.418 --> 28:35.386
He's been to war. He's seen so much

28:35.421 --> 28:38.456
life-changing stuff.

28:38.490 --> 28:43.061
He's friends with guys who have had
their arms blown off, and I've... 

28:43.095 --> 28:45.163
been to high school.

28:45.230 --> 28:46.898
Yeah.

28:46.932 --> 28:49.100
A deaf high school.

28:49.134 --> 28:50.868
And you are an amazing artist.

28:50.903 --> 28:54.739
And there was this woman there,

28:54.773 --> 28:57.775
this medic, and she's like... 

28:57.810 --> 29:02.447
dragged people from
burning tanks or whatever.

29:02.481 --> 29:05.383
And... 

29:05.417 --> 29:07.351
Ty's been with her.

29:07.386 --> 29:09.620
Oh.

29:09.655 --> 29:11.189
<i>Been with her.</i>

29:12.357 --> 29:14.225
Yeah.

29:14.259 --> 29:16.327
And have you and Ty... ?

29:16.361 --> 29:19.997
<i>Can this please not be that talk?</i>

29:20.032 --> 29:22.800
I've been sufficiently
humiliated enough for one day.

29:22.835 --> 29:23.935
Got it.

29:27.673 --> 29:30.742
I definitely know what it's like to
be with someone from a different world.

29:30.776 --> 29:34.479
You feel like everybody's
looking at you, wondering

29:34.639 --> 29:35.739
"how did that happen?"

29:35.773 --> 29:37.841
You start comparing yourself

29:37.876 --> 29:41.411
with whoever you think
he's supposed to be with.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.479
But that is a trap.

29:42.513 --> 29:44.514
The only thing that matters

29:44.549 --> 29:46.617
is how you two feel

29:46.651 --> 29:49.453
when the rest of the world goes away.

29:49.487 --> 29:53.190
If you can be yourself
and still feel beautiful

29:53.224 --> 29:55.292
and loved and appreciated,

29:55.326 --> 29:58.095
then the rest is just noise.

29:58.129 --> 30:00.063
Yeah.

30:00.098 --> 30:01.064
I hear you.

30:02.267 --> 30:03.834
It's still annoying.

30:03.868 --> 30:05.836
Yeah. I know.

30:05.870 --> 30:07.070
<i>(Engine turns over)</i>

30:16.781 --> 30:18.548
Hi. Uh, yes.

30:18.583 --> 30:22.352
I actually was accepted to
WashU a couple months ago.

30:23.454 --> 30:25.589
Yes. Yeah, I know that.

30:25.623 --> 30:28.425
And, uh, I was wondering

30:28.459 --> 30:30.160
if I could still get my slot.

30:32.297 --> 30:34.398
No. Yeah, I mean that makes total sense.

30:34.432 --> 30:37.234
Is there a waiting list or... 

30:39.137 --> 30:40.837
That long, really? Okay.

30:43.841 --> 30:45.776
Could you put me on there anyway?

30:50.949 --> 30:52.716
You want help?

30:52.750 --> 30:54.618
Yeah.

30:54.652 --> 30:56.653
I hope you got good
feedback after the meeting.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.989
I did.

30:59.023 --> 31:02.793
Apparently Whitney thinks
you two have a "vibe."

31:04.762 --> 31:06.730
A "vibe"?

31:06.764 --> 31:09.533
Why didn't you just send
Barbara like we had planned?

31:09.567 --> 31:10.600
Why did you have to come yourself?

31:10.635 --> 31:12.302
I was trying to help.

31:12.337 --> 31:15.472
I know Whitney's amazing,
she runs her own business,

31:15.506 --> 31:19.042
she has her own house, she's gorgeous.

31:19.077 --> 31:20.177
Wait, what?

31:20.211 --> 31:21.979
She's not camped out at
her ex-boyfriend's house

31:22.013 --> 31:25.082
realizing that she is
starting all over... again.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.952
She just made different choices than you.

31:28.987 --> 31:30.887
What's this about?

31:30.922 --> 31:32.756
You really think I would
try to seduce your boss?

31:32.790 --> 31:34.891
You know what? Um... 

31:34.926 --> 31:36.026
this was a mistake.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.761
Okay, I'll get out of it.

31:37.795 --> 31:39.663
No.

31:39.697 --> 31:40.831
I meant moving in here.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.401
I have never been able to be around you

31:44.435 --> 31:46.370
without feeling... 

31:46.404 --> 31:48.572
(Sighs) invisible.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.376
You've never been invisible to me.

31:57.315 --> 31:59.182
(Sighs) I... I can't.

32:01.052 --> 32:03.120
I just got out of treatment.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.190
I can't.

32:07.225 --> 32:08.859
I have to wait.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.995
Then I'll wait.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.803
(Deeply exhales) I am so ready for bed.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.609
Yeah.

32:25.643 --> 32:29.212
Are you reading the education bill?

32:30.214 --> 32:31.548
Are you voting on that or am I?

32:33.484 --> 32:35.318
I'm just trying to help you, honey.

32:35.353 --> 32:37.421
- We're all just trying to help you.
- Okay. All right.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.256
Daphne already yelled at me tonight.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.024
Yeah. (Clears throat)

32:41.059 --> 32:42.993
She told me.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.328
I don't think you have any
idea what it's like for her.

32:45.363 --> 32:46.363
(Sighs)

32:46.397 --> 32:48.899
She had one dad that left her,

32:48.933 --> 32:52.903
and now she's terrified
that she's gonna lose you.

32:54.739 --> 32:56.706
I know.

32:56.741 --> 33:00.610
And you know, she is not the
only one who is terrified.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.812
I thought you were gonna die.

33:02.847 --> 33:03.847
You know, that could have happened.

33:03.881 --> 33:06.850
You need to know that.

33:06.884 --> 33:10.320
You're one of the most
driven men I know, but... 

33:10.354 --> 33:14.257
Kathryn, it is not realistic for
me to take a couple of months off!

33:14.292 --> 33:16.126
I've got a family that needs me,

33:16.160 --> 33:17.527
I've got a business that
I can barely keep going

33:17.562 --> 33:19.329
when I'm at 100%. And right now,

33:19.363 --> 33:21.198
I've got members of my own party

33:21.232 --> 33:22.432
circling me like sharks.

33:22.466 --> 33:24.267
Who cares?!

33:24.302 --> 33:26.870
So someone finds out
you had a heart attack,

33:26.834 --> 33:31.071
so you don't get re-elected,
so you lose a business!

33:31.105 --> 33:33.673
What, you're gonna kill yourself just

33:33.708 --> 33:35.642
because you're embarrassed?!

33:35.676 --> 33:37.777
Or you don't wanna look weak?

33:37.812 --> 33:39.579
What am I supposed to do, huh?

33:39.614 --> 33:41.481
Just let my whole life go?

33:41.516 --> 33:43.683
John, I... 

33:43.718 --> 33:47.654
I've seen you go from baseball star

33:47.688 --> 33:51.458
to businessman to State Senator.

33:54.529 --> 33:57.430
I have been right there with you... 

33:57.465 --> 34:01.935
when overnight we became parents to
a deaf teenager who we'd never met.

34:03.237 --> 34:05.138
None of these transitions have been easy.

34:07.074 --> 34:09.074
But you made the changes that you had to

34:09.110 --> 34:11.645
and you became a better man because of it.

34:14.649 --> 34:16.583
Honey.

34:20.454 --> 34:22.322
This is the new reality.

34:23.791 --> 34:25.659
Don't leave me alone in it.

34:41.717 --> 34:42.618
Good morning.

34:42.721 --> 34:46.223
- Oh, sweetie!
- Yeah.

34:46.257 --> 34:48.358
I'm putting a full day
in on the couch today.

34:48.426 --> 34:50.494
Would you mind taking
a look at that for me?

34:50.527 --> 34:52.228
Sure. What is it?

34:52.263 --> 34:53.330
<i>A press release.</i>

34:55.199 --> 34:58.102
I'm going with "cardiac incident."

34:58.136 --> 35:00.137
Does that sound like too much of a dodge?

35:00.171 --> 35:02.106
No.

35:02.140 --> 35:03.140
It's fine.

35:08.580 --> 35:10.614
- So, it's still your ribs?
- Yeah.

35:10.648 --> 35:12.916
I won't be playing in
any softball tournaments

35:12.951 --> 35:14.718
<i>anytime soon.</i>

35:14.753 --> 35:17.521
Guess you won't get to
see me back in my uniform.

35:17.555 --> 35:19.423
I'll see that soon enough.

35:19.457 --> 35:20.624
I'm gonna get started on this.

35:22.260 --> 35:23.460
I'm proud of you.

35:23.495 --> 35:27.164
Thank you. Hey, kiddo.

35:28.533 --> 35:31.401
I was just gonna make some breakfast.

35:31.436 --> 35:32.369
How you feeling?

35:32.403 --> 35:35.205
Uh, pretty crappy. Thank you for asking.

35:35.240 --> 35:37.374
Do you have... 

35:37.408 --> 35:41.111
any of those fixings for a tofu scramble?

35:41.146 --> 35:42.980
Oh, we don't have to have that.

35:43.014 --> 35:44.248
Just tell me what you want. I'll make it.

35:44.282 --> 35:48.118
No, tofu scramble sounds perfect.

35:51.990 --> 35:53.023
(Groans)

35:53.057 --> 35:54.625
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

35:54.659 --> 35:55.993
Hey.

35:56.027 --> 35:58.662
Hi. How'd the Lerner installation go?

35:58.696 --> 35:59.630
Perfect.

35:59.664 --> 36:01.532
Oh, good.

36:01.566 --> 36:04.668
- So I did some asking for you... 
- Thanks, Jack.

36:04.702 --> 36:06.603
And it turns out Angelo is married.

36:06.638 --> 36:09.239
He just doesn't wear a wedding ring.

36:09.274 --> 36:11.375
Oh.

36:11.409 --> 36:12.576
Yeah.

36:12.610 --> 36:15.445
Well, that's a shame.

36:15.480 --> 36:18.015
- Thank you for asking, though.
- Of course.

36:25.190 --> 36:27.291
Tofu scramble with fake cheese.

36:29.160 --> 36:30.828
It's delicious.

36:30.862 --> 36:33.163
- I'm sure.
- (Both chuckle)

36:33.198 --> 36:37.034
So, um, I wanted to talk to you... 

36:37.068 --> 36:39.803
about the car wash.

36:39.838 --> 36:42.573
Actually, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that,

36:42.607 --> 36:46.084
because I'm sorry that I
have not been as appreciative

36:46.085 --> 36:47.285
of your work over there.

36:47.445 --> 36:49.646
Oh, no, it's not that. Um... 

36:49.681 --> 36:54.484
I heard that Travis wanted the job... 

36:54.519 --> 36:57.487
That was a tough decision.
Don't feel bad about that.

36:57.522 --> 37:01.291
Travis is a good kid. His time will come.

37:01.326 --> 37:03.260
But you were the guy for that job.

37:03.294 --> 37:04.428
Pure and simple.

37:04.462 --> 37:07.998
Well, I was... kinda wondering about that.

37:08.032 --> 37:09.933
Um... 

37:09.968 --> 37:11.869
'cause, you know, there's some things... 

37:13.371 --> 37:15.272
you know, like talking to the guys and... 

37:18.176 --> 37:19.176
I'm not sure I'm... 

37:19.210 --> 37:20.811
Toby.

37:20.845 --> 37:24.081
There's a learning curve with
that job. I know. I did it.

37:24.115 --> 37:25.082
You're doing great.

37:27.085 --> 37:28.952
And I gotta tell you,

37:28.987 --> 37:32.489
I don't know what I would do

37:32.523 --> 37:33.557
without you over there.

37:37.695 --> 37:40.397
Well, I need your approval

37:40.431 --> 37:41.431
on a new coupon.

37:41.466 --> 37:43.300
You're the new manager.

37:43.334 --> 37:45.235
Whatever you think is best. I trust you.

37:46.504 --> 37:47.437
Thanks.

37:50.375 --> 37:54.378
I thought you might want to
taste the fruits of your labor.

38:09.127 --> 38:12.062
The most delicious peace offering

38:12.096 --> 38:13.730
I've ever received.

38:16.901 --> 38:19.970
I'm sorry about the worst
first date in history.

38:20.004 --> 38:24.541
I just got too scared that I went
a little overboard on everything.

38:24.575 --> 38:25.636
It's okay.

38:25.637 --> 38:29.095
Now I know I'll have an attentive
nurse should I ever injure myself.

38:29.380 --> 38:31.648
(Both laugh)

38:38.323 --> 38:39.356
What are these?

38:39.390 --> 38:42.159
Guest passes for the country club.

38:42.193 --> 38:44.261
I'm gonna teach you how to swim.

38:46.064 --> 38:47.998
You won't be the first who's tried.

38:48.032 --> 38:50.267
I'm pretty hopeless.

38:50.301 --> 38:53.937
Jace, you can ride a unicycle.

38:53.972 --> 38:57.074
I promise you can learn to
swim in a country club pool.

39:01.846 --> 39:04.681
Oh, that smells amazing.

39:04.716 --> 39:06.083
Pasta puttanesca.

39:06.117 --> 39:07.818
It's ready in 10 minutes.

39:09.921 --> 39:11.888
I'm gonna go change

39:11.923 --> 39:13.824
and put my shoes away.

39:16.861 --> 39:18.595
(Cellphone vibrates)

39:22.734 --> 39:24.568
Regina!

39:24.602 --> 39:26.436
They found my baby!

39:30.408 --> 39:31.508
Hey.

39:32.677 --> 39:36.146
Wow, even a psycho meltdown
can't scare you away.

39:37.348 --> 39:38.348
Is that what you were hoping?

39:40.084 --> 39:41.018
No.

39:42.387 --> 39:45.055
Look, I feel terrible about what happened.

39:45.089 --> 39:47.891
Could we just not talk about that?

39:47.925 --> 39:48.959
Like ever?

39:51.262 --> 39:54.097
I was hoping we could have a do-over.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.634
I would love that.

39:57.668 --> 39:58.802
<i>(Acoustic guitar music playing)</i>

I hate this music.

Hang on.

40:43.047 --> 40:44.848

40:44.882 --> 40:47.017
It's clean. I'm pretty sure.

40:47.051 --> 40:49.052
(Laughs)

40:49.087 --> 40:50.821
Dude, I'm on a budget here.

40:50.855 --> 40:54.691
I can see that from the lack
of rose petals on the bed.

40:54.725 --> 40:56.660
Well, at least I didn't light incense.

40:56.694 --> 40:57.627
Gotta give me that one.

41:14.712 --> 41:15.712
Ah, hang on.

41:18.316 --> 41:20.250

Ah, could we maybe...

41:36.267 --> 41:39.069

- (Both laugh)

41:41.172 --> 41:43.473
This is definitely not
going according to my plans.

42:10.201 --> 42:11.434
Wait. The candles.

42:11.469 --> 42:13.436
- Oh, no.
- It's all right.

42:13.471 --> 42:15.172
I got it.

42:20.311 --> 42:21.378
'Cause that's all we need, right?

42:21.412 --> 42:23.213
Is for the fire alarm to go off

42:23.247 --> 42:26.283
and then the sprinklers turn
on and everybody's rushing in,

42:26.317 --> 42:29.119

you guys doing in there?"
