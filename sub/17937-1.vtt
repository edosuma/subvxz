00:24.840 --> 00:27.040
Don't. Just stay.

00:27.040 --> 00:28.360
Please stay.

00:29.640 --> 00:31.360
I have to.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.040
Just don't go up. Please.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.440
You can't do this every time.
It's my job, Jess.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.240
I just... I don't want you to go.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.440
I can't let the team down.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.400
You mean you can't let Lori down?

00:45.520 --> 00:47.600
No, Jess. I can't.

01:13.520 --> 01:14.920
Morning. Hi.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.920
They're good to go.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.280
I checked them.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.200
Yeah, and I'm double-checking 'em.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.080
Don't trust me?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.560
What's he doing here?

01:35.560 --> 01:36.640
Rafe!

01:36.640 --> 01:38.560
Come on, man. One slip-up!

01:38.560 --> 01:40.880
Yeah, one slip-up
that could've killed someone.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.200
It won't happen again.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.640
You stink of booze.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.720
From last night.
I haven't touched a drop today.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.160
I wouldn't. I'm not stupid!

01:49.160 --> 01:51.160
Get Out. Out now.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.760
Hey, why're you being
such a ball-breaker?

02:00.760 --> 02:02.520
He needs our support!

02:04.200 --> 02:05.800
What? Is he in trouble?

02:07.800 --> 02:09.080
Not him.

02:10.639 --> 02:13.280
I've made a big mistake, Lori.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.840
Yeah? About what?

02:16.920 --> 02:18.840
I'll deal with it myself.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.520
Stix!

02:42.640 --> 02:46.520
RAISED VOICES

02:46.520 --> 02:48.680
Give me one more week.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.840
I can't give you a week!

02:50.840 --> 02:52.000
OK, forget it!

03:39.320 --> 03:40.680
Ready?

03:40.680 --> 03:42.320
Ready!

03:42.320 --> 03:44.080
Ready?

03:44.080 --> 03:45.560
I said yes.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.240
All right, let's do this.

05:45.520 --> 05:46.920
I've been trying to call you.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.560
No hands. Nowhere to park.
Parked miles away.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.120
Grockle season.
It's like an invasion.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.640
They'll be gone September.

05:53.640 --> 05:54.840
The sooner the better.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.160
Davey's called. He's with
a fatality down at the Drop Zone.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.120
Lori, the woman who runs it,

06:00.120 --> 06:02.880
has specifically asked
for you to go down, too.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.120
There's the address.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.160
Thanks.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.160
Morning.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.360
Good morning.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.480
OK, so it's a skydiving school -

06:11.480 --> 06:14.200
teaching displays, charity events,
competitions.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.800
In fact, they were training for
a competition when it happened.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.680
Who died? Rafe Phelps,
chief instructor and co-owner.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.520
What do you expect
jumping out of an airplane?

06:23.520 --> 06:25.480
Actually,
the risk's pretty low, I believe.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.040
I think the road you just drove
in on's more dangerous.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.000
It's cos you're scared
of heights, that's all.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.080
Anyway, Lori,
she's done everything by the book,

06:32.080 --> 06:33.600
just wanted to have you here.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.560
Jumping thousands of feet
with nothing but

06:35.560 --> 06:37.920
a bit of material to save you is...
It's just madness.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.320
Anyway, I'm not scared of heights.
Just sensible.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.000
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

06:44.920 --> 06:48.440
Right, this is Jane Kennedy,
the coroner.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.280
Thanks for coming. I'm so sorry.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.760
This is Lori, she was jumping
with Rafe when it happened,

06:52.760 --> 06:54.800
and this is Anthony King -
he's the other jumper.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.720
Call me Stix.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.720
Sorry, I keep seeing him.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.480
I can't get him out of my mind.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.920
You should go home.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.160
Ah. Not possible, I'm afraid - we're
going to need to take a statement.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.920
Where is he? Where's Rafe?

07:06.920 --> 07:08.520
Jess, I'm so sorry.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.320
I want to see him.
Right, sorry, who's this?

07:10.320 --> 07:12.400
Oh, this is Rafe's wife.
This is Jess Phelps.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.240
Ah, right, Mrs Phelps,
I'm DS Higgins, South Dart Police.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.560
I want to see my husband.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.840
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea. Not right now.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.400
Believe me, you don't.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.000
Could you take Mrs Phelps outside
for me, please?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.760
Come this way please, madam.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.680
Hey, can you just give us a minute?

07:31.680 --> 07:33.000
Yeah.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.480
Um... There's something
I think you need to see.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.640
We use two parachutes -
a main and a reserve.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.960
If there's a problem
with the main parachute,

07:46.960 --> 07:49.480
you pull your cut away
and pull the reserve.

07:49.480 --> 07:52.800
Standard procedure.
Extra precaution.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.840
I examined the parachute
straight after it happened.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.600
The British Parachute Association,
they'll confirm what I found.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.160
Which is?

08:00.160 --> 08:02.160
This wasn't an accident.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.520
How do you know?

08:03.520 --> 08:05.240
Both chutes were sabotaged.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.960
The connector links
on the main parachute had been cut.

08:07.960 --> 08:11.120
And the reserve cable
was cut and he didn't have

08:11.120 --> 08:14.760
an automatic activation device
fitted, so nothing deployed.

08:16.360 --> 08:19.600
Rafe was a dead man the moment
he climbed on to that plane.

08:23.240 --> 08:24.280
Excuse me.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.680
Excuse me.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.200
It's worse than the
returns queue at IKEA.

08:30.200 --> 08:33.039
It's the offer. Pasty and a pint
for a fiver. It's doing well.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.760
Yeah, well, it's giving me
a headache.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.360
Thought people came here
for peace and quiet? And the views.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.960
And this is the best view
in the world. Wall-to-wall profit.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.520
Table three needs clearing, Beth.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.880
Careful!

08:43.880 --> 08:45.160
Sorry.

08:45.160 --> 08:48.400
Sorry,
she's always getting in the way.

08:48.400 --> 08:52.120
It's funny how someone so small
is always getting under your feet.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.800
Pasty and a pint?

08:53.800 --> 08:56.920
No. Treble vodka, please. Neat.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.120
Excuse me.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.200
Maybe you should take it easy.
No chance. I'm getting wasted.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.440
I just killed my best friend.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.720
So we're looking for someone
who knows about parachutes.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.680
Well, I don't know. Couldn't anyone
have cut the straps?

09:11.680 --> 09:14.320
Well, no, not anyone.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.680
I mean, you'd have to be able
to hide what you did.

09:16.680 --> 09:17.920
You know, repack it.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.720
Any idea who could have done that?

09:19.720 --> 09:22.600
No. I mean, none of us would have.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.600
Then why didn't you say anything
in front of Stix?

09:25.600 --> 09:28.280
Listen, I'm going to need
to take statements from anyone

09:28.280 --> 09:29.760
who had access to the parachutes,

09:29.760 --> 09:31.880
so can you get the ball rolling,
please? Sarge.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.280
RINGING

09:33.280 --> 09:35.040
Mum, I'm at work. What is it?

09:36.760 --> 09:39.000
What?!

09:39.000 --> 09:41.440
No, no, no - just keep taking
those statements, will you?

09:41.440 --> 09:42.840
I'll be back soon as I can.

09:42.840 --> 09:43.960
All right. Bye-bye.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.440
What are you doing?
Just leave me to it, will you?

09:46.440 --> 09:49.560
I've got this. No, Mum called me!
Anyway, I want to see Beth.

09:49.560 --> 09:51.920
You don't. You're just being nosy.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.000
Oh!

09:54.000 --> 09:55.520
Davey, I'm so sorry.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.680
Oh, brilliant. Thanks a lot(!)

09:57.680 --> 09:59.120
That is just brilliant(!)

09:59.120 --> 10:01.200
Put it in a bag of rice
in the airing cupboard.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.400
It should be fine.
I can do it if you want me to.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.160
No, no. Leave it! Leave it.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.920
Excuse me.

10:06.920 --> 10:09.560
We gave him vodka,
to stop him leaving.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.080
Thought it best.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.880
Right, OK. Hey. Hey, come on.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.120
I believe you were involved
in the incident at the Drop Zone?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.240
Who're you?

10:22.560 --> 10:25.120
I'm DS Higgins, South Dart Police.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.680
You better arrest me, then.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.560
Why? What did you do?

10:28.560 --> 10:30.280
Hey, come on. Hey, hey.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.200
What did you do?

10:32.200 --> 10:33.840
He was my best mate...

10:34.920 --> 10:36.240
I can't...

10:36.240 --> 10:39.240
All right,
just tell me what you told Judith?

10:41.040 --> 10:44.280
I can't interview him like this.
He needs to sober up.

10:44.280 --> 10:45.840
What did he say?

10:45.840 --> 10:49.720
He said he may as well have
pushed him out of the plane himself.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.600
All right, can you do me a favour?

10:51.600 --> 10:54.360
Can you keep him here till we can
get him picked up? No more vodka!

10:55.560 --> 10:58.520
Judith, have you got
a phone I can use?

10:58.520 --> 10:59.600
Where're you going?

10:59.600 --> 11:01.120
Back to the Drop Zone.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.280
I can take you if you like.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.360
No, you're all right.
Don't think I could risk it.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.120
Anyway, I thought you wanted
to see Beth?

11:06.120 --> 11:07.560
CLATTER

11:07.560 --> 11:08.960
Oh, nice work, Beth(!)

11:08.960 --> 11:10.880
There's a couple you didn't
break there!

11:10.880 --> 11:12.320
Stop it. I'm not in the mood.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.080
Must be like looking in a mirror.

11:14.080 --> 11:17.600
Got that phone, Judith?
Oh - you got a bag of rice?

11:18.800 --> 11:22.920
Look, can you just move back
already? Please!

11:22.920 --> 11:24.560
How's it going?

11:24.560 --> 11:29.160
It's totally doing my head in.
Been rammed all day.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.080
Still, I'm off in ten minutes.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.800
I am going to rent a boat

11:32.800 --> 11:35.680
and go out sea as far
as humanly possible.

11:35.680 --> 11:37.640
Oh, I don't think
that's a very good idea.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.280
It was a joke. Oh.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.320
Although I think it's the
best idea I've had all morning.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.880
Hang on, I'm going to get
a dust pan and brush.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.760
OK.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.560
Eddie never went anywhere
near Rafe's rig.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.680
Rafe brought it in from home.

11:51.680 --> 11:54.480
Did anyone double-check
the parachute?

11:54.480 --> 11:56.560
No, Rafe said he'd done it.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.200
Did he leave it unattended?

11:58.200 --> 12:00.840
Well, only for a few minutes.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.720
Did anyone else
have access to the parachute?

12:04.720 --> 12:07.240
Um... Me, Stix.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.480
And Eddie.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.040
Right. So Eddie could have done?

12:12.040 --> 12:15.880
No, I don't think so.
We're like a family.

12:17.640 --> 12:21.160
Me and Rafe started this place
nearly 16 years ago now.

12:21.160 --> 12:25.960
Well, families fall out, don't they?
Why wasn't Eddie skydiving?

12:25.960 --> 12:28.840
He packed a rig wrong and
Rafe chucked him off the team.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.240
Was he happy about that?

12:30.240 --> 12:33.760
Well, no, but he wouldn't have
killed him.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.040
Why didn't I double-check his rig?

12:39.040 --> 12:41.040
Apparently, it's too dangerous.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.560
It is too dangerous!

12:42.560 --> 12:44.080
Hello, I'm from London!

12:44.080 --> 12:46.200
Exactly - you don't know
the risks down here.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.280
What, like being hit by a beachball?

12:49.520 --> 12:51.240
Maybe I should try skydiving?

12:51.240 --> 12:54.280
Nah, I used to do it.
it was way too expensive.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.280
When I wanted to be on my own,
I used to go to Roamer's Bay.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.040
No-one ever goes there. Why not?

12:59.040 --> 13:00.440
It's got quicksand.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.840
That's an old wives' tale.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.320
It's a private beach.
The owner wants to keep people away.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.280
Because it's got quicksand!

13:06.280 --> 13:07.800
So where is it?
RINGING

13:07.800 --> 13:10.280
Hold on. I've got to get that.
You're not going to Roamer's Bay!

13:10.280 --> 13:12.920
Is there actually anything
you'll let me do? Coroner's office.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.040
Put your clothes away?
Tidy your room?

13:15.040 --> 13:16.440
Very funny.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.720
OK, if you just hold on one second.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.760
Jane, Jess Phelps. She can't
reach Davey, she wants an update.

13:21.760 --> 13:22.880
Right.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.800
Mrs Phelps?

13:25.800 --> 13:28.920
Jess. OK. Keep calm.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.920
Where is it? I's better not.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.240
Well, look, I can come over
if you like.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.440
All right. I'll see you soon. Bye.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.600
Can you let Davey know?

13:40.600 --> 13:41.880
Yeah, yeah, I'll call him.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.600
Ah. Could be tricky.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.520
Slight problem with his phone.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.680
What kind of problem?

13:47.680 --> 13:49.160
Erm...

13:50.560 --> 13:54.000
I keep thinking that
there's been a mistake.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.000
He's going to walk back in.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.640
Can I can call anyone for you?

14:00.640 --> 14:02.080
Family?

14:03.160 --> 14:04.720
He was all I had.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.360
I just want him back.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.040
Give me a second, Jess.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.720
How is she?

14:19.720 --> 14:21.640
Heartbroken.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.240
Said anything?

14:23.240 --> 14:24.280
No.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.200
Jess...

14:31.080 --> 14:33.640
It wasn't an accident.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.160
Rafe's parachutes
had been tampered with.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.560
It was deliberate?

14:40.600 --> 14:42.160
Maybe he had...

14:42.160 --> 14:44.040
packed his chute wrong?

14:44.040 --> 14:46.320
No, no. I'm afraid not, no.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.480
It was both chutes.
The strapping had been cut.

14:49.480 --> 14:53.400
So can you think of anyone who might
want to harm your husband?

14:53.400 --> 14:55.800
No!

14:55.800 --> 14:58.160
Everyone loved him.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.120
Everyone!

15:00.120 --> 15:02.240
OK. Can you put the kettle on,
please?

15:02.240 --> 15:03.440
Sure.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.480
Can we go outside?

16:17.800 --> 16:21.720
We met in a bar in Byron Bay.
Rafe was competing.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.960
We started talking, never stopped.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.080
We were engaged six days later,

16:28.080 --> 16:30.760
married after two months
and that was four years ago.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.320
So it was love at first sight?

16:33.320 --> 16:36.080
Would you have preferred
to stay in Australia?

16:36.080 --> 16:39.320
Rafe would.
There's better jumps there.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.680
I just wanted to be with him.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.560
You a skydiver as well?

16:44.560 --> 16:48.840
I'm terrified of heights.
Hated it every time he went up.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.440
Didn't want him to go this morning.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.320
What can you tell me
about the team at the Drop Zone?

16:56.600 --> 16:59.480
They were close. Tight.

16:59.480 --> 17:02.000
He'd been running it for years
with Lori.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.560
So they all got on?

17:03.560 --> 17:06.720
I guess so.
I didn't really know them.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.880
So how come you weren't
friendly with them, then,

17:08.880 --> 17:11.960
if they were like
one big happy family?

17:11.960 --> 17:13.920
Well, they were Rafe's, not mine.

17:15.240 --> 17:18.400
I don't know. I tried to get on
with them.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.920
I tried everything I could,

17:19.920 --> 17:23.359
but they're not really keen
on outsiders.

17:23.359 --> 17:24.960
Who's "they"?

17:26.160 --> 17:31.440
Lori. She, um...she was
his first girlfriend.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.160
Couldn't have been easy for her,
him turning up here with me.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.360
They were still together?

17:36.360 --> 17:37.920
No, no, they broke up years ago,

17:37.920 --> 17:41.360
but women always have
a thing for their first love.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.120
Well, not strictly true.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.160
Not all women.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.600
Jess, when I was making the tea,
I found these.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.960
Folic acid.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.760
I'm not pregnant.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.640
I'd love to be.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.680
I have been pregnant once.

18:04.840 --> 18:08.000
I found out
on my 39th birthday,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.760
and I lost it the same day.

18:11.200 --> 18:14.000
And ever since then,
no matter what I tried,

18:14.000 --> 18:18.200
I just couldn't get pregnant again.

18:21.160 --> 18:26.040
We were doing IVF.
It was our fourth round next week.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.600
That was our last chance.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.000
Hi! Hiya.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.680
Hi! Good day? Well...

18:43.680 --> 18:45.200
I'm making dinner for us all.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.680
Oh! How come you're so happy?

18:47.680 --> 18:49.600
What, I'm not allowed to be
happy now, either?

18:49.600 --> 18:51.720
No, of course you are, it's lovely.
It's just...

18:51.720 --> 18:54.840
It was just a headache.
I was fine once I chilled out.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.040
What news?

18:56.040 --> 18:58.720
Oh. Wow.

18:58.720 --> 19:02.080
We're having a "spa" night.
Your mum's idea.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.680
Well?

19:03.680 --> 19:05.920
Did he do it? Eddie?

19:05.920 --> 19:08.840
Well, Davey's interviewing him
tomorrow.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.640
You know I couldn't tell you
even if he did.

19:10.640 --> 19:13.800
That's all right.
I'll offer him a free pint
and he'll sing like a canary.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.480
No, he doesn't! He does.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.720
She's right. You'd better offer him
a pasty as well.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.400
Here, this face mask thingy,

19:20.400 --> 19:22.400
it's supposed to get nice
and warm, is it?

19:22.400 --> 19:23.680
How warm?

19:23.680 --> 19:26.720
Like someone's
just napalmed my face?

19:26.720 --> 19:28.000
Get upstairs quick.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.160
Hey? I thought the burning was good.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.600
Get rid of the dead cells!

19:32.720 --> 19:34.520
What's that for?

19:34.520 --> 19:36.800
Just thinking how lucky
I am to have you.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.680
Oh, no! Oh!

19:42.680 --> 19:44.480
ALARM BEEPS

19:46.160 --> 19:50.280
I'm sorry.
I should've checked his parachute.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.760
Look, Rafe wouldn't want you
to be alone.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.160
Can I... Can I come in?

20:14.240 --> 20:16.960
I never touched Rafe's rig.
I wouldn't!

20:16.960 --> 20:19.400
You told half the Black Dog
it was your fault.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.320
Yeah, because I hadn't checked it.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.760
So why didn't you check it?

20:22.760 --> 20:24.680
Well, he wouldn't let me.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.120
Because?

20:27.600 --> 20:30.360
I've had some issues.

20:33.080 --> 20:37.360
My wife left. I started drinking.
Didn't stop.

20:39.040 --> 20:42.520
I made a mistake packing a chute
and Rafe laid down the law,

20:42.520 --> 20:45.040
said I was off the team
till I got sober.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.040
Well, that sounds fair enough to me.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.000
Look...

20:52.000 --> 20:56.200
Rafe annoyed the hell out of me.
He was patronising, bossy...

20:57.680 --> 21:01.320
..but he was like a brother, man.
I loved him. We all did.

21:01.320 --> 21:04.440
I'd never hurt him.
None of us would.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.280
We were...

21:07.320 --> 21:08.760
What?

21:08.760 --> 21:10.200
No, it's nothing.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.240
No, come on, Eddie. What?

21:15.080 --> 21:19.080
I saw him having an argument
yesterday. With Stix.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.520
Didn't hear what it was about.

21:20.520 --> 21:21.640
With Stix?

21:28.320 --> 21:29.680
All right?

21:32.480 --> 21:34.320
Fancy a sausage?

21:36.800 --> 21:39.240
Eddie said you argued
with Rafe yesterday.

21:39.240 --> 21:43.520
What? You can't trust Eddie.
Reckon he'd had a couple.

21:43.520 --> 21:46.120
Not by then. Not according to him.

21:46.120 --> 21:48.920
And Lori doesn't seem
to think so, either.

21:50.920 --> 21:54.480
Rafe wanted to change a manoeuvre,
I said let's stick to the plan.

21:54.480 --> 21:58.880
Can't change a routine
at short notice. It's not safe.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.920
Eddie said Rafe shoved you.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.720
Just being passionate.
It's what he was like.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.960
Really?

22:06.960 --> 22:09.560
I've been reading up on you.
Quite interesting.

22:09.560 --> 22:12.240
Breaking and entering.
Stealing cars.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.040
Resisting arrest.
That was a long time ago.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.520
Four years. Not that long.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.800
Rafe gave me a job when
no-one else would even look at me.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.560
Why would I want to hurt him?
I owe him everything.

22:20.560 --> 22:25.160
Exactly. So, I'll ask you again,
why did you argue?

22:25.160 --> 22:28.160
It was about the jump.

22:28.160 --> 22:29.600
It wasn't me.

22:30.880 --> 22:35.320
He's hiding something. I don't know
what, though. I checked Jess out.

22:35.320 --> 22:38.160
She was a nursery school teacher
in Melbourne. No criminal record.

22:38.160 --> 22:40.400
Permanent visa came through
last month.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.680
Did you get anything off his phone?
E-mails?

22:42.680 --> 22:45.800
No, ta. Annette gave
me a cake for the boss' birthday.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.720
I've had two slices already.

22:47.720 --> 22:50.040
There was nothing
out of the ordinary, no.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.720
I'll tell you what is weird, though.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.840
What? Rafe withdrew a large amount
of money two weeks ago.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.760
Six grand.
Almost everything they had.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.840
That is weird. What did Jess say?

22:58.840 --> 23:02.360
News to her. As far as she aware,
everything was going on the IVF.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.680
Could it have been
for the Drop Zone?

23:04.680 --> 23:06.560
No, not according to Lori.

23:06.560 --> 23:09.440
Strange he didn't tell Jess
about the money though, isn't it?

23:09.440 --> 23:11.440
I think she might be involved,
you know, Lori.

23:11.440 --> 23:14.120
I think Jess could be right,
she could still be in love with him.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.640
Those feelings never really go away,
do they?

23:16.640 --> 23:19.160
You know what women are like -
more emotional.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.640
In...

23:20.640 --> 23:24.280
If Lori was involved, why insist
everything was above board?

23:24.280 --> 23:26.440
Why even mention the chutes
were damaged?

23:26.440 --> 23:27.920
She'd want to hide it.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.360
Emotional!

23:29.360 --> 23:31.200
No, I didn't mean... I wasn't...

23:31.200 --> 23:34.920
Phone's fixed. Apart from a
bit of rice stuck in the jack there.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.520
Oh, give it here. Oh!

23:36.520 --> 23:37.920
SPLASHING

23:37.920 --> 23:39.920
Davey, I'm so sorry.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.280
Three hours I've had that back!
Three hours!

23:42.280 --> 23:44.280
Clint! You got our spare work phone?

23:44.280 --> 23:46.600
Your old one,
before we got it upgraded?

23:46.600 --> 23:47.920
You mean the emergency phone?

23:47.920 --> 23:50.280
Yeah. Can you get it,
and lend it to Davey, please?

23:50.280 --> 23:52.880
But it's our phone.
In case our phones break.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.280
Yeah, but ours are working.

23:54.280 --> 23:57.320
Please? There's been
a slight problem with Davey's.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.400
Oh, you haven't? Not again?

24:06.520 --> 24:08.760
BANGING

24:50.480 --> 24:52.920
BIRDSONG

24:57.680 --> 24:59.160
Sarge?

24:59.160 --> 25:00.200
Yeah?

25:05.440 --> 25:06.480
Well!

25:10.880 --> 25:13.040
There must be thousands there.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.280
All right, I'll get these checked.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.120
Jess.

25:24.040 --> 25:27.000
I take it you haven't seen this
before, no?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.760
No - where was that?

25:28.760 --> 25:32.240
In Rafe's drawer. Any idea
who could have put it there?

25:32.240 --> 25:34.000
No!

25:34.000 --> 25:36.360
OK. Are you OK?

25:36.360 --> 25:38.320
Yeah, fine.

25:38.320 --> 25:41.800
Well, I'll have an officer stay with
you until we get this place secured.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.560
But if you need anything in the
meantime you can always call me.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.760
All right? OK.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.000
Stix.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.640
Stix!

26:33.720 --> 26:36.160
Hey, hey! I need your bike.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.680
Give me your bike!
Police - get off, give me your back!

26:38.680 --> 26:40.640
You'll get it back!
You'll get it back!

27:19.320 --> 27:20.720
I could do this all day.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.280
So why did you run?

27:23.280 --> 27:25.440
You've got your finger prints
all over Rafe's house,

27:25.440 --> 27:27.720
all over the drawers,
all over the money you put back.

27:27.720 --> 27:29.960
It wasn't hard to work out.
I wanted to give it back.

27:29.960 --> 27:32.000
Rafe gave me the money
a couple of weeks ago.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.120
What for? Well, cos he found out
I was in debt.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.320
Because?

27:35.320 --> 27:37.200
Skydiving. Skydiving?

27:37.200 --> 27:39.320
It's addictive. A buzz.

27:39.320 --> 27:43.360
That moment where you're falling
and nothing else matters. Nothing.

27:44.520 --> 27:45.680
But it costs.

27:45.680 --> 27:48.040
Rafe found out how much I owed
and bailed me out.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.520
And I couldn't keep it. Not after.

27:49.520 --> 27:50.920
So why did you break in?

27:50.920 --> 27:52.920
He made me promise not to tell Jess.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.600
I couldn't just hand it to her.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.800
Right, I'm going to ask you one
last time - why did you argue?

27:57.800 --> 28:02.720
Rafe wanted the money back,
and I said I'd spent it.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.920
A down payment for a base jump
at Angel Falls in Venezuela.

28:05.920 --> 28:09.680
And he went mad,
said he'd never trust me again.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.640
I'll just be a minute.
Clint, you said it was urgent?

28:14.640 --> 28:16.520
Yeah, Rafe's doctor's just called.

28:16.520 --> 28:19.360
They got a letter this morning
from a private clinic.

28:19.360 --> 28:23.960
I e-mailed it over and I thought
you might want to have a read of it
as soon as possible.

28:37.240 --> 28:41.080
Surfing, Sunday?
Yeah, I'll tell him.

28:41.080 --> 28:43.560
I feel like Clint's
social secretary.

28:43.560 --> 28:44.760
Rafe's footage.

28:44.760 --> 28:49.000
Oh. Rafe was diagnosed
with motor neurone disease.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.800
His doctor missed it.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.760
Thought it was a frozen shoulder.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.360
Rafe wasn't happy,
so he went to a private clinic,

28:55.360 --> 28:56.800
and they diagnosed it.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.520
He's a bit young for that, isn't he?

28:58.520 --> 29:00.200
Yeah, younger than average.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.800
In his case, it would've
affected his speech, swallowing,

29:02.800 --> 29:04.560
even his breathing.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.640
He was given a life expectancy
of a couple of years.

29:07.640 --> 29:11.440
Wow. And he was still skydiving? Hm.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.120
Does Jess know?

29:15.200 --> 29:19.920
He wasn't ill. He can't have been.
He would've told me.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.240
We were trying for a baby.

29:22.240 --> 29:25.080
His consultant said
he was devastated.

29:25.080 --> 29:28.160
Did he never mention anything
about his health?

29:29.360 --> 29:33.120
Nothing. He didn't say anything.

29:34.160 --> 29:37.800
Jess, I'm going to need to see
where Rafe kept his kit.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.960
You think he did this himself?

29:49.240 --> 29:50.320
Sarge.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.240
Good work.
Can you bag that up for me, please?

30:45.080 --> 30:48.920
No. Rafe would never've
killed himself jumping. No way.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.040
He was ill.

30:50.040 --> 30:52.440
It didn't feel like his last jump.

30:52.440 --> 30:56.360
He was exactly the same,
there was nothing different about...

30:58.520 --> 31:00.240
There was something?

31:04.800 --> 31:08.960
He said something about...
that he'd made a mistake.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.240
What about?

31:10.240 --> 31:13.000
I don't know.
He said he'd deal with it.

31:16.840 --> 31:21.920
Were you and Rafe...?
I know you used to be together. Oh!

31:21.920 --> 31:25.400
Look, whatever it was,
it had nothing to do with me.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.880
He was in love with Jess.
They were trying for a baby.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.200
Of course. I didn't....

31:29.200 --> 31:30.240
I just...

31:30.240 --> 31:31.440
Sorry.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.480
DOOR CLOSES

32:07.440 --> 32:08.480
Oh, no...

32:11.760 --> 32:13.320
You've got to be joking!

32:26.480 --> 32:28.600
And whatever you two are having
when you're ready.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.840
A weekend away at a proper spa.
You can go on your own.

32:30.840 --> 32:33.560
I'm not going anywhere near one of
those places. It's too dangerous.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.560
Two Bacardi and cokes, cheers.

32:35.560 --> 32:37.920
Hey, buy you a drink?
Celebrate finishing the case.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.240
Nothing, thanks.

32:39.240 --> 32:41.360
All right. Cheap round.
You haven't finished.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.960
Why's that, then?

32:42.960 --> 32:44.360
SHE SIGHS

32:44.360 --> 32:47.800
Why would Rafe kill himself in front
of the people he was closest to?

32:47.800 --> 32:50.880
I dunno, chasing the buzz?
Stix said it was addictive.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.840
Can I see the footage from the jump?

32:52.840 --> 32:55.320
Why? Look, you don't have
to watch it with me.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.280
Will you just e-mail it to me?
Please?

32:57.280 --> 32:59.000
All right. Go on, then. Thanks.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.840
What was that?
RINGING

33:01.840 --> 33:05.040
Hello? No, it's not Clint.

33:06.320 --> 33:07.760
Beth?

33:07.760 --> 33:09.320
He seems pretty calm.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.920
He's doing the routine.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.320
It's drilled into you.

33:14.320 --> 33:18.440
It becomes instinct. Look,
locate, cutaway, reserve, arch.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.600
Why would Rafe pull the reserve
if he'd cut the lines himself?

33:21.600 --> 33:22.760
No idea.

33:30.280 --> 33:32.080
Whatever you've got planned,
cancel it.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.440
We're going to work at mine.

33:33.440 --> 33:34.960
Sounds good to me.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.960
Beth!

33:43.960 --> 33:45.760
Davey! Davey, help.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.200
All right, love. All right.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.840
I'm stuck!
Don't panic, love, don't panic.
It's the worst thing you can do!

33:59.360 --> 34:00.880
All right, Beth.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.840
I'm going to grab that towel.

34:05.560 --> 34:09.239
I want you to catch it and I'm going
to try to pull you out, all right?

34:09.239 --> 34:11.800
All right? Yeah.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.360
Come on.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.880
Come on. I'll do it again.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.239
Come on.

34:23.760 --> 34:26.360
Stay still, stay still.

34:34.440 --> 34:40.000
Stay nice and calm, nice and calm.
Stay nice and calm, nice and calm.

34:58.160 --> 35:02.840
OK. Again, again.
Put your arm round...

35:23.320 --> 35:24.600
OK.

35:24.600 --> 35:25.640
You OK?

35:26.720 --> 35:28.400
I thought I was going to drown.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.160
This place is full of quicksand,
Beth.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.520
That's why no-one uses it!

35:31.520 --> 35:32.960
That's what Mum said.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.400
What, and you still came?

35:34.400 --> 35:35.960
I thought it'd be OK!

35:35.960 --> 35:39.840
How bloody stupid are you? Huh?
People have died here!

35:39.840 --> 35:43.840
People have died here, Beth! They've
died! You would've been next.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.520
We wouldn't have found you - we
wouldn't have known where to look.

35:46.520 --> 35:50.720
We would've lost you, Beth!
We would've lost you!

35:50.720 --> 35:53.520
Please don't tell Mum.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.600
All right. All right.

35:57.200 --> 36:00.160
OK. I'm sorry, darling.

36:13.320 --> 36:16.120
I was just about to call you.
I gave Beth a lift home.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.560
You OK?

36:17.560 --> 36:19.960
Yeah. Headache's back.
I'm going to go upstairs

36:19.960 --> 36:21.200
and have a lie-down.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.800
OK. Painkillers're in the bathroom.

36:25.040 --> 36:28.000
Rafe went through the main drill.
The one you do if your chute fails.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.120
So?

36:29.120 --> 36:31.480
So why do that if he'd
sabotaged his own chutes,

36:31.480 --> 36:33.240
if he wanted to kill himself?

36:33.240 --> 36:35.800
I dunno, survival instinct,
changed his mind. Take your pick.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.440
OK, OK, thanks.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.560
That was the IVF clinic.
What did they say?

36:39.560 --> 36:41.040
Well, hang on. The IVF clinic?

36:41.040 --> 36:44.320
Yeah. Rafe cancelled two weeks ago,
said they'd changed their minds.

36:44.320 --> 36:47.360
Jess would've known.
She would've been in touch
with them the week before.

36:47.360 --> 36:50.040
They want to make sure you're OK,
that you're taking your pills.

36:50.040 --> 36:53.840
Actually, I saw some pills in her
cupboard. Clomiphene citrate?

36:53.840 --> 36:55.680
No, never heard of that.

36:56.680 --> 36:58.040
Where're you going?

36:58.040 --> 36:59.120
Back to work.

36:59.120 --> 37:02.160
Hold up. I'll come with you
Catch you in a bit.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.240
OK.

37:03.240 --> 37:06.920
The drug's called
clomiphene citrate.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.920
That looks smaller than the others.

37:08.920 --> 37:11.040
Yeah. That's what I thought.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.120
You definitely don't prescribe it?

37:14.400 --> 37:17.880
All right, great. Thank you -
that's been very helpful. Bye.

37:17.880 --> 37:19.480
You were right.
It's not one of theirs,

37:19.480 --> 37:22.480
but it is used to stimulate ovaries.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.920
What's that?

37:23.920 --> 37:25.800
It's a parachute.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.040
There you are, look.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.280
Look, see? Same logo.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.440
Oh, yeah.

37:33.440 --> 37:37.040
Hello? Hi. Thanks for getting back,
I'm sorry it's so late.

37:37.040 --> 37:39.200
It's DS Higgins, South Darts Police,
UK.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.440
I'm checking one of your members.

37:41.440 --> 37:46.240
Do you have a Jessica Jackson or
a Jessica Phelps registered to you?

37:48.400 --> 37:52.280
You don't? OK, no, no, not to worry.

37:52.280 --> 37:53.680
Thank you.

37:53.680 --> 37:55.880
Sorry - sorry! Hang on!

37:55.880 --> 37:59.400
Do people register
under nicknames, do you know?

38:00.720 --> 38:02.160
They do?

38:06.120 --> 38:07.720
You said it was urgent?

38:14.160 --> 38:15.200
Jess...

38:16.280 --> 38:18.080
I know you used to be a skydiver.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.800
I checked with the
Australian Parachute Federation.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.880
JJ - that's your jumping name.
Jessica Jackson, your initials.

38:26.880 --> 38:30.240
And your last registered jump
was on your 39th birthday,

38:30.240 --> 38:32.320
which was the day you lost
your baby.

38:34.280 --> 38:36.560
So is that why you wanted the IVF?

38:38.160 --> 38:39.400
A baby.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.280
Something that you wanted more than
anything else in the world...

38:42.280 --> 38:44.920
To have it taken away,

38:44.920 --> 38:47.880
and the months and months
of trying for another one.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.040
All you could think about.

38:53.120 --> 38:55.720
And then Rafe told you that
he didn't want one.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.640
He knew how much I wanted a baby.

39:01.760 --> 39:04.240
He knew I did everything I could...

39:04.240 --> 39:08.320
just to hold my own child.
He took that away.

39:09.720 --> 39:11.240
Never said why.

39:15.040 --> 39:18.160
You thought he was in love
with Lori?

39:18.160 --> 39:20.440
I asked him.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.960
I asked if he wanted
to leave me for her.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.160
He didn't answer.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.480
I couldn't stop myself.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.560
I wanted to punish him.

39:35.160 --> 39:37.360
I went to the garage.

39:37.360 --> 39:38.960
I found his rig.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.720
I don't know why I did it.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.920
I love him.

39:54.280 --> 39:56.000
Where did you get these?

39:58.280 --> 40:03.480
Online. My best mate in Oz, Stacey,
she swore by them.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.200
They gave her twins.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.560
And how long have you been
taking them for?

40:07.560 --> 40:09.160
Four months.

40:10.760 --> 40:14.600
Jess, in a small percentage
of women,

40:14.600 --> 40:19.320
these tablets can induce
psychosis, paranoia.

40:19.320 --> 40:23.480
Your hormones go haywire.
You imagine all sorts.

40:23.480 --> 40:26.720
But they worked for Stacey.
I was taking double the dose.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.000
Triple.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.200
No, love.
These wouldn't have helped.

40:31.600 --> 40:34.640
I think Rafe was going to tell you
that he was ill.

40:34.640 --> 40:37.960
He told Lori that he'd made
a terrible mistake,

40:37.960 --> 40:41.920
and I think he realised
he shouldn't have cancelled the IVF.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.600
He...

40:46.600 --> 40:47.640
s...

40:49.440 --> 40:52.360
He still loved me?

41:02.960 --> 41:04.760
Can I ask you something?

41:04.760 --> 41:07.960
If it's, "Can I borrow
your mobile phone?" then no.

41:07.960 --> 41:10.520
How come you know so much about IVF?

41:10.520 --> 41:14.520
Oh, Annette got pregnant six months
after we got together.

41:14.520 --> 41:17.240
It's kind of why
we got married, really.

41:17.240 --> 41:20.680
She said her dad would kill her.
And then she...

41:21.920 --> 41:26.480
Well, so we tried IVF - that didn't
work, and we didn't try again.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.680
Well, you'd have made a great dad.

41:30.680 --> 41:31.840
Davey?

41:37.880 --> 41:39.360
Did you tell her?

41:39.360 --> 41:42.200
No, no. And I'm not going to.

41:42.200 --> 41:45.560
On one condition - if you ever
want to go off on your own again,

41:45.560 --> 41:48.280
you tell me, OK, and even then
I might come with you.

41:48.280 --> 41:50.880
Non-negotiable. All right, deal?

41:51.920 --> 41:53.160
Deal.

41:54.480 --> 41:57.840
Oh, Clint. You can have
this back now, mate.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.840
I got a new one. Oh, cheers.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.760
Oh, Lauren rang.
You met her at the beach last week?

42:02.760 --> 42:03.960
Oh, yeah, yeah.

42:03.960 --> 42:06.480
Yeah. Sorry, pal. Just wants
to be friends. Oh.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.880
Not all bad news, though.

42:07.880 --> 42:11.160
Your mate Woody called.
He's got a special deal on ounces.

42:20.200 --> 42:21.600
OK, are we good to go?

42:21.600 --> 42:22.680
Ready.

42:22.680 --> 42:25.160
Ready. Love you, man.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.240
One last jump, Rafe.
