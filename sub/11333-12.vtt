WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.211
Previously on 90210:

00:03.253 --> 00:05.547
I want the same stuff
I got last time.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.134
You had sex with Naomi's sister?

00:09.176 --> 00:10.385
She told me
she was her neighbor.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.680
I'm going to destroy Jen
before she destroys me.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.306
I just don't know
how I'm going to do it.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.349
I'm not giving up, you know?

00:15.390 --> 00:17.100
Not until Naomi
knows the truth.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.435
How you lied
to me that night.

00:18.477 --> 00:19.561
You turned me
against her!

00:21.730 --> 00:23.941
I'm sorry. I never even
thanked you for your help.

00:23.983 --> 00:25.776
You were great.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.611
Whoa. We're in public.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.989
Don't worry about it.
It's not like anybody saw us.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.950
I found this homeless guy.

00:32.992 --> 00:35.160
He'd been mowed over
by a hit and run driver.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.453
Before I fell down the stairs,

00:36.495 --> 00:38.873
I was pushed,
and I know who did it.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.042
(school bell ringing)

00:45.713 --> 00:47.589
♪ ♪

01:04.313 --> 01:06.316
We have been dispatched
to spread winter cheer.

01:06.358 --> 01:07.693
And to tell you all

01:07.735 --> 01:09.987
BOTH:
...the Winter Wonderland Dance
is near.

01:10.029 --> 01:12.239
(excited chatter)

01:13.407 --> 01:15.158
Thanks.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.996
Hmm, Winter
Wonderland Dance...

01:19.038 --> 01:21.498
I better, uh, dust off
my princess crown.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.876
You don't want
to go, I get it.
You do?

01:23.918 --> 01:26.336
I just... I used to love
going to dances.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.964
You know, getting ready
and going with someone
that I liked,

01:29.006 --> 01:30.674
seeing my friends
all dressed up,

01:30.716 --> 01:33.552
but whatever, that
was another lifetime.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.013
Well, we couldn't go
even if we wanted to, right?

01:36.055 --> 01:38.682
Since your dad's
going to be there,
chaperoning or whatever.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.852
Well, actually, he's
going to be away
at a conference.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.687
Oh.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.898
But it's no big deal.
Like I said,

01:45.940 --> 01:47.900
school dances,
another lifetime.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.526
I would, however,
like to see

01:49.568 --> 01:51.737
that princess crown of yours
sometime though.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.782
I'll be right back.
Wait for me.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.914
Annie, wait.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.083
I need to talk to you.

02:06.418 --> 02:10.047
Look, I understand why you
haven't returned my calls.

02:10.089 --> 02:12.716
I wouldn't return my calls
either, if I were you.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.051
I made a huge mistake

02:14.093 --> 02:15.636
when I accused you
of sleeping with Liam.

02:17.096 --> 02:18.221
It was my sister.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.057
Yeah, I heard.

02:20.099 --> 02:22.476
I'm so sorry, Annie.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.144
I-I should have
just listened to you.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.395
I don't even know why I didn't.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.731
Maybe, maybe it has to do
with my own insecurities

02:27.773 --> 02:30.150
or what happened
with Ethan, I don't know.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.403
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.280
When I think about
what I put you through...

02:35.322 --> 02:37.992
Hell.

02:38.033 --> 02:41.453
You put me through hell, Naomi.

02:47.793 --> 02:50.420
NAVID:
I can't go to the police.
What am I supposed to say?

02:50.462 --> 02:52.171
That I think he pushed me

02:52.213 --> 02:54.299
right before I fell
down the stairs?

02:54.341 --> 02:56.093
Tell them you saw a pair
of black combat boots.

02:56.135 --> 02:58.971
So? Half the school
wears black combat boots.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.430
Yeah, but half the school
didn't threaten you.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.765
Yeah, it's not enough.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.600
Look, I might not be able
to prove that Jasper pushed me,

03:03.642 --> 03:05.144
but there's got to be
a way to get proof

03:05.184 --> 03:06.227
that he's a drug dealer.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.395
Lila, hey!

03:07.437 --> 03:09.564
Just the person
that I wanted to see.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.108
Guys, this is Lila--
my star reporter.

03:11.150 --> 03:13.944
Yeah, well, your "star
reporter's" hit a road block.

03:13.986 --> 03:15.403
Kids who do drugs
don't exactly want

03:15.445 --> 03:16.613
to advertise it
in the Blaze.

03:16.655 --> 03:17.906
NAVID:
Who cares about the Blaze?

03:17.948 --> 03:19.282
I just need to find
someone who is willing

03:19.324 --> 03:21.160
to tell the principal
that Jasper dealt to them.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.121
Oh, the principal.
Why didn't you say so?

03:24.163 --> 03:25.330
That should be easy!

03:25.372 --> 03:28.125
No, I need that proof, okay?
And once I get

03:28.167 --> 03:29.793
that proof, I can go
to the administration

03:29.835 --> 03:31.128
and then the authorities.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.587
And once I'm done
with that dirtbag,

03:32.629 --> 03:34.089
he won't even know what hit him!

03:34.131 --> 03:35.256
Dude.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.508
Careful with that pool cue.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.387
Right, uh... sorry.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.436
...ridiculous,
if you ask me.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.898
Jeez, watch where
you're going, freak.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.483
Man, do you kick
babies and puppies, too?

03:53.525 --> 03:55.944
Whatever, you cannot pay me
enough money to wear a tutu.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.529
Or go to a West Bev
dance, huh?

04:00.199 --> 04:02.951
Actually, I don't know,
I'd think it'd be funny

04:02.993 --> 04:05.453
to just go and, you know, like,
see what all this hype's about.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.122
Throw some pig's blood
on the ballerinas...

04:07.164 --> 04:09.416
Right, come on, Liam.
I wouldn't do that.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.835
I'll get us
a table, guys.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.420
I'll be right back.
Okay.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.132
Hey, you.
Hey.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.966
Would you like
to sponsor me?

04:19.009 --> 04:20.677
I'm doing a 5K run
to raise money

04:20.719 --> 04:22.387
for breast cancer research.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.513
Yeah, sure.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.681
What's up with the T-shirt?

04:24.723 --> 04:27.684
Oh, uh, I'm a Ford
Warrior in Pink.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.186
It's in honor of my mom.

04:29.228 --> 04:30.311
All net proceeds

04:30.353 --> 04:31.980
go to the cause.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.648
You know, I think you
should really get one.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.150
Maybe a pink jacket.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.860
Really bring out your eyes.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.528
I'll think about it.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.863
Anything for the cause.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.865
That's the spirit.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.118
So listen, um...

04:44.159 --> 04:46.578
You going to the
Winter Wonderland Dance?

04:46.620 --> 04:48.622
Uh, yeah. Naomi and I
are gonna stop by

04:48.663 --> 04:50.749
for a few hours before
we go to St. Barts.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.294
Mm-hmm. So, you're saying
I'll have to one-up St. Barts

04:54.335 --> 04:58.381
if I want you to ditch Naomi
and go with me instead?

04:58.423 --> 05:01.593
Are you asking me
to go with you?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.511
Like... on a date?

05:03.553 --> 05:05.472
I sure am.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.433
(laughs):
Yeah, right. Come on.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.185
I know your idea of a date.
You show up

05:10.227 --> 05:11.519
with one girl,
leave with another.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.105
Whatever. Anyway,

05:13.147 --> 05:15.649
here is a form in case
you want to sponsor me.

05:20.612 --> 05:23.907
So, I was like,
"Look, dude, you are way
out of line, douchebag."

05:23.949 --> 05:25.784
You said that
to Mr. Huang?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.953
Well, in my head I did.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.871
Yeah.
(giggles)

05:32.415 --> 05:35.085
Hey, I should
talk to Naomi.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.419
See if she's okay.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.046
I haven't spoken to her
since the races, you know?

05:38.088 --> 05:39.631
Right. Sure.

05:47.306 --> 05:48.932
Hey.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.143
Hey.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.644
I just wanted to check in.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.937
Make sure you're okay.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.689
(sighs)

05:55.730 --> 05:57.565
You know, right after
everything happened,

05:57.607 --> 05:59.234
I wanted to thank you.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.610
Oh, no, it's all right.

06:00.652 --> 06:01.862
Let me finish.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.783
That's how I felt right
after everything went down.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.702
But as I've had
more time to think,

06:08.743 --> 06:10.996
I've gotten more
and more upset.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.208
You could have put a stop
to this months ago, Liam.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.750
Why didn't you tell me
what happened prom night?

06:15.792 --> 06:17.294
Look, I wanted to.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.962
I didn't think you'd
believe me over Jen.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.505
So you just kept it to yourself?

06:20.547 --> 06:22.590
Naomi, you don't understand.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.218
Oh, you're right.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.719
I don't understand.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.497
Naomi!
No, I'm okay. I'm...

06:56.583 --> 06:57.918
(sighs)

06:57.959 --> 07:00.754
When am I going
to stop liking him?

07:00.795 --> 07:04.299
No, you just tell,
just tell Liam how you feel.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.927
No. I can't tell him how I feel.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.970
He should have told me
the truth and he didn't.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.805
And I don't want to be involved
with someone like that.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.352
Besides, it doesn't
matter anyway.

07:15.394 --> 07:18.063
I saw him kissing that
barefoot surfer chick.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.647
Apparently, he likes
the smell of B.O.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.691
They were kissing?
When?

07:21.733 --> 07:23.235
At the races.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.987
Whatever!
I just need to stay strong

07:26.029 --> 07:28.531
and find some St. Barts hottie

07:28.573 --> 07:30.158
to take my mind off
of everything.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.869
(chuckles)
How do I look?

07:32.911 --> 07:34.788
I'd ease up on the
lip gloss a little bit.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.540
Oh, be quiet!
I look fantastic.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.626
All right,
let's get out of here.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.136
Blue 42, hut-hut! Hike!

07:49.177 --> 07:51.179
Go deep! Go deep!
Oh!

07:52.139 --> 07:53.974
(all exclaiming)

07:54.015 --> 07:56.017
That's what I'm
talking about, baby!

07:56.059 --> 07:57.477
Whoo!

07:57.518 --> 07:59.479
All right, it's a go
for Troy Polamalu.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.731
Let's do this.
Dude, Polamalu plays defense.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.109
Dude, you seriously need to give
your man card back right now.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.068
Whatever, toss the grapes.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.783
So, uh, you gonna ask Ivy
to the dance or what?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.118
What are you talking about?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.120
Oh, come on.
She was throwing around hints

08:15.162 --> 08:16.455
like crazy yesterday.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.498
At least you know
if you ask her

08:18.539 --> 08:19.833
to the dance,
she'll say yes.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.294
I got shot down yesterday.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.838
By who? Angelina Jolie?
(chuckles)

08:26.214 --> 08:28.342
Um...

08:28.383 --> 08:30.177
I, um, I asked Silver.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.179
To the dance?
Yeah.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.888
Man, I'm sorry. I should have
run it by you first.

08:33.929 --> 08:37.225
No, no-no, no, no, it's cool.
Seriously.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.477
Not that it matters.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.145
She made up her mind about me.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.562
NAVID:
So?

08:41.604 --> 08:44.565
You can get someone to see you
in a different light, bro.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.485
How's that?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.528
Are you seriously asking me
for advice on girls?

08:48.569 --> 08:50.864
Oh, man card,

08:50.905 --> 08:53.033
back in the pocket!

08:53.074 --> 08:54.659
All right.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.203
So what do you think
I should do?

08:56.244 --> 08:58.538
You have to prove to her that
you're not a player anymore.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.874
Gotta let her know that you're
serious about being with her.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.626
Show her your heart.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.714
"Show her your heart?"

09:07.755 --> 09:09.132
Do you want to burn
his man card or should I?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.890
So we can totally
go topless in St. Barts.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.393
Please, don't go
topless in St. Barts.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.560
Oh, don't worry.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.812
I've been tanning my
tatas in anticipation.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.314
Hey.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.484
Hi.

09:29.610 --> 09:32.239
Naomi, I heard
what happened with Jen.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.448
If there's

09:33.490 --> 09:35.700
anything you need...
Yeah, I'll pass.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.577
You're not exactly
someone I can rely on.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.297
I cannot
believe I missed

09:49.339 --> 09:51.132
the grape-tossing contest,

09:51.174 --> 09:53.427
'cause I'm pretty much
the champion.

09:53.468 --> 09:54.469
Of course you are.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.720
I'm being serious.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.098
Here, watch and learn.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.350
You don't want to go
to the dance, do you?

10:02.352 --> 10:05.397
Why? Are you, like, asking me?

10:05.439 --> 10:07.232
You know, but if you don't
want to go that's cool.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.983
No, I mean, whatever.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.860
Sure, I'll go.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.946
Cool.
Cool.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.049
I'm just gonna get
some books from my car.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.093
But you're more than
welcome to follow me
there, if you'd like.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.761
Nah, I'm just...

10:36.803 --> 10:38.096
I'm waiting for you
to mess up.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.640
And when you do, I'll be there.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.809
Wow. Just like Batman.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.103
I know you pushed me
down the stairs.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.231
Look, I...

10:48.273 --> 10:50.150
I know you suffered
a head injury,

10:50.191 --> 10:52.611
but I didn't know you were
suffering from delusions.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.070
You talked to your
doctor about that?

10:54.112 --> 10:55.655
Oh, I know you did it.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.407
All right, and I'm going
to bring you down.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.993
Well, let me know
how that goes, Batman.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.085
Ade...

11:09.127 --> 11:11.796
I need your help.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.513
So, I know who pushed me
down the stairs.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.722
Who?
Jasper.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.850
Oh, my God.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.477
Yeah, I saw him
right before I fell.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.728
Or I saw his shoes,
but I know it was him.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.106
But why?
Why would he do that?

11:30.148 --> 11:31.566
Because I told him
to stay away from you.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.777
The thing is, I can't prove it.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.655
What I can prove
is that he's a drug dealer.

11:36.695 --> 11:39.907
If someone will come forward
and say that he dealt to them.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.201
Come forward?

11:41.242 --> 11:42.701
And I didn't know
if I could ask you

11:42.743 --> 11:44.371
because things have been
weird between us,

11:44.412 --> 11:45.913
but I've tried everything else.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.249
Navid, I really wish I could.

11:48.291 --> 11:51.044
But I'm still on probation.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.881
Can I do it anonymously?

11:54.922 --> 11:57.551
I can't go to the administration
with an anonymous source.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.094
I'm really sorry.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.681
Yeah, I get it.

12:04.599 --> 12:08.645
Yeah, I'll just, uh, hey,
I'll figure something else out.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.740
Okay, you want me
to kick your butt

12:21.782 --> 12:24.536
with the blue ball
or the orange ball?

12:24.578 --> 12:26.162
Seriously?

12:26.204 --> 12:28.248
You took me out of school
to play mini golf?

12:28.289 --> 12:29.790
Come on, this used
to be our thing.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.293
Remember that summer we
played mini golf every day?

12:32.335 --> 12:34.254
Yeah, I was ten.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.339
Well, I wasn't, and I
still had a good time.

12:36.381 --> 12:37.465
'Course that might've been

12:37.507 --> 12:39.551
because I schooled
you-- mom-style.

12:39.593 --> 12:43.054
Swishin' and swashin' and
dishin' it into the hole.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.391
Dixon...
What?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.767
how long are you
going to stay mad at me?

12:48.809 --> 12:52.230
Can we just go home?

12:52.272 --> 12:54.148
Yes.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.775
After I beat you.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.820
Oh, God.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.906
Annie.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.324
Can I talk to you?

13:03.366 --> 13:05.619
Free country.

13:05.660 --> 13:10.123
Look, I owe you
a huge apology.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.832
I should've told Naomi
who I slept with.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.293
Yeah, no kidding.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.714
At first, I didn't
want to hurt Naomi.

13:17.756 --> 13:20.174
Then I was gonna tell her, but
her sister, Jen, threatened me.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.135
What's going on?

13:22.176 --> 13:24.387
Hey.
Hey.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.602
Anyway, I just
wanted to apologize,

13:30.644 --> 13:32.186
that's all.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.232
I'll see you around.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.195
Yeah, right.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.115
Like an apology
is gonna make it better.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.245
Whatcha thinking?

13:49.287 --> 13:51.665
Nothing, just that...

13:51.706 --> 13:54.875
Naomi's sister sounds like
a sociopath, that's all.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.711
I mean, it's crazy.
At the end of the day,

13:56.753 --> 14:00.006
she's the only reason
why we all fought, you know,

14:00.047 --> 14:03.384
she is the only reason
why none of us are friends.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.470
If it was me, I would keep
thinking about the fact that...

14:05.512 --> 14:07.555
they should've believed you
in the first place, you know.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.390
Yeah, no, that's true.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.310
I just, sometimes I miss...

14:12.352 --> 14:13.353
What?

14:13.394 --> 14:15.522
I don't know...

14:15.563 --> 14:16.897
Everything.

14:20.527 --> 14:25.406
Well, whatever you do, I'm here.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.826
And, uh, by the way,

14:27.867 --> 14:29.076
what time should I
pick you up for the dance?

14:29.118 --> 14:30.411
What?

14:30.453 --> 14:32.872
If you used to have fun
at dances, well, then

14:32.913 --> 14:35.249
I see no reason why we
won't have fun together.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.419
But dances are not your thing.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.047
Making you happy is my thing.

14:55.645 --> 14:58.147
Look, I'm sorry
I lied to you.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.774
I was just trying
to protect you.

14:59.816 --> 15:03.737
It came from a good
place, but I was wrong.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.739
But you owe me an apology, too.

15:05.780 --> 15:06.906
What you said

15:06.947 --> 15:08.449
about me not being
your real mom,

15:08.491 --> 15:09.909
that was incredibly hurtful.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.078
I was just mad.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.496
Well, it was a low blow.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.626
I remember when you first
came to live with us,

15:18.668 --> 15:20.169
I would watch you
sleep at night,

15:20.211 --> 15:22.129
wondering if you would
ever let me in.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.633
You were so quiet
and so withdrawn.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.301
I didn't know what to say.

15:28.845 --> 15:32.139
I mean, I went from sharing
a room with my grandmother,

15:32.181 --> 15:34.350
praying that we'd have enough
money to keep the heat on

15:34.392 --> 15:36.936
to this big house
in the suburbs.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.484
I knew it would be
a hard adjustment.

15:43.526 --> 15:47.614
I just... I don't think
I knew how hard.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.282
Everything was different.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.950
Everything.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.619
I mean, it was like
I woke up one morning

15:52.660 --> 15:54.621
surrounded by white people
I was supposed to bond with...

15:54.662 --> 15:56.247
(snapping):
...like that.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.335
I never thought
I would though.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.422
I kept telling myself,
"Dix, just hang in there

16:04.464 --> 16:06.674
until you're 18,
get yourself out of there."

16:06.716 --> 16:10.595
I kept telling myself,
"Just keep trying

16:10.637 --> 16:13.097
and maybe one day
he won't look so miserable."

16:15.266 --> 16:18.728
You got used to Annie first.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.229
She wouldn't
leave me alone.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.064
She kept coming in my room
telling me how super-duper

16:22.106 --> 16:23.817
it was to have a big brother.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.653
I would watch you
with her laughing

16:26.694 --> 16:29.906
and I would be so jealous
of my eight-year-old daughter.

16:33.576 --> 16:37.288
You know, sometimes I...

16:37.330 --> 16:41.417
I think about my life now,
in Beverly Hills,

16:41.459 --> 16:44.462
how I got from there to here.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.131
It just doesn't make any sense.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.761
But one thing I never
question...

16:51.803 --> 16:54.681
is that you're my mom.

announcement to make.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.035

would be a good way

17:16.076 --> 17:19.246
to let a certain someone
know I'm serious.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.123
I'm done dating.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.916
Totally done.

very special.

What's going on?

36:27.019 --> 36:28.436

There was something
you wanted to tell me.

36:34.776 --> 36:35.944

36:35.986 --> 36:37.487
Well, she did.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.948
And I'm here and I'm about
to take off to St. Barts soon.

36:39.990 --> 36:41.825
So what is it that she thought
you wanted to tell me?

36:41.867 --> 36:43.743
I don't know.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.997
Why? Is there something
you want to tell me?

36:47.039 --> 36:49.124
I asked you first.

36:49.166 --> 36:50.834
And I came over here, Liam.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.752
Exactly.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.296
What'd you come over for?

36:56.464 --> 36:57.966
I don't know.

36:58.008 --> 37:00.218
I guess I thought things were
going to be different.

37:00.259 --> 37:01.469
You would be different.

37:01.511 --> 37:02.971
But you know what,
you're not.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.931
You're private
and secretive, just like

37:04.973 --> 37:06.141
you always were.

37:06.183 --> 37:08.267
That was the whole problem
all along.

37:08.309 --> 37:09.978
You'll never be able to open up.

37:10.020 --> 37:11.897
I mean, you can't tell me
what's under your stupid tarp.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.608
Whatever. I'm done.

37:18.153 --> 37:20.030
Wait.

37:33.543 --> 37:34.711
I'm building a boat.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.629
Yeah.

37:39.549 --> 37:41.718
Wow.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.511
Why?

37:43.553 --> 37:47.015
Things are...

37:47.057 --> 37:48.725
bad at home.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.476
They told me at
the Wilderness Program

37:50.518 --> 37:52.395
to redirect my anger, so...

37:53.730 --> 37:55.941
whenever I get upset,
I just come out here.

37:57.692 --> 37:58.777
And I build.

38:00.445 --> 38:01.863
Why a boat?

38:04.282 --> 38:06.701
I used to sail.

38:06.743 --> 38:10.205
With my dad before...

38:10.247 --> 38:11.915
before he went away.

38:15.252 --> 38:17.545
Naomi, I'm so sorry.

38:17.587 --> 38:19.256
I should have
told you about Jen.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.591
After prom,
she came up to me

38:21.633 --> 38:22.968
and she told me
she was your neighbor.

38:23.009 --> 38:25.053
And all the personal stuff
that I had told you,

38:25.095 --> 38:27.931
she said she overheard you
telling your friends about it,

38:27.973 --> 38:29.099
and laughing.

38:29.141 --> 38:30.433
What?

38:30.475 --> 38:32.560
Afterwards, when I found
out she was your sister,

38:32.602 --> 38:35.063
I realized she lied.

38:35.105 --> 38:37.149
But by then, it was too late.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.069
I didn't want to hurt you.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.116
And like you said,
I'm private and secretive.

38:46.158 --> 38:48.576
But I don't want to be.

38:53.790 --> 38:56.668
And if you give me
another chance...

38:59.129 --> 39:01.339
I won't be.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.775
♪ ♪

39:34.331 --> 39:36.291
Hey, there you are.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.501
I've been looking for you
for, like, 45 minutes.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.130
Babe, are you okay?

39:42.172 --> 39:44.966
You're a drug dealer.

39:45.008 --> 39:46.634
What are you talking about?
Don't...

39:46.676 --> 39:48.887
Don't deny it.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.889
Ade told me that
you sold to her.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.265
I know it's true.

39:55.227 --> 39:57.312
Okay.

39:57.354 --> 39:58.396
It is true.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.483
But I, I only sold to people

40:02.525 --> 40:03.902
who were going
to buy it anyway.

40:03.943 --> 40:04.986
Stop.
No, babe,

40:05.028 --> 40:06.321
it's all to finance the film.

40:06.363 --> 40:07.405
Just stop.

40:09.366 --> 40:11.659
I don't even know who you are.

40:11.701 --> 40:14.162
That is not true.

40:14.204 --> 40:16.248
You know me, Annie,
and I know you.

40:18.541 --> 40:21.419
You pushed Navid down
the stairs, too, didn't you?

40:21.460 --> 40:24.756
No...
No more lies.

40:24.797 --> 40:25.924
Okay, please.

40:25.965 --> 40:28.885
Just no more lies.

40:28.927 --> 40:32.013
I didn't push him
down the stairs.

40:32.055 --> 40:34.391
I pushed him, then he fell.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.229
(cries)
Look, Annie.

40:39.271 --> 40:40.855
No, don't.
Stay away from me.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.232
You don't mean that.

40:42.274 --> 40:44.192
Yeah, I do.

40:44.234 --> 40:46.945
Why? Because I've
made some mistakes?

40:48.613 --> 40:50.573
You've made mistakes,
but I don't judge you.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.867
What are you talking about?

40:52.909 --> 40:57.622
I accidentally pushed Navid
down the stairs.

40:57.663 --> 41:00.499
And you accidentally
ran over my uncle.
