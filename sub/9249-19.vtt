00:00.507 --> 00:02.212
<i>Previously on</i> Mike & Molly...

00:02.213 --> 00:04.042
Look at you,
writing again.

00:04.043 --> 00:05.343
Yeah, new story.

00:05.344 --> 00:06.343
About a young girl

00:06.345 --> 00:07.879
coming of age
on a hardscrabble farm

00:07.880 --> 00:09.847
at the base
of the Mudlick mountains.

00:09.849 --> 00:11.082
Mudlick? Th-That's weird.

00:11.083 --> 00:13.684
My mom grew up
on a farm in Mudlick.

00:16.187 --> 00:18.489
Oh, no!

00:18.491 --> 00:20.759
I have to see
Mudlick for myself.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.193
When Hemingway
wrote about Paris,

00:22.194 --> 00:23.528
he walked those streets.

00:23.529 --> 00:25.195
It's what made it authentic.

00:25.197 --> 00:27.464
You know, she still has a sister
down in Mudlick.

00:27.466 --> 00:28.932
No! I didn't
know that.

00:28.934 --> 00:31.236
See, that's the kind of stuff
I'm hoping to dig into

00:31.237 --> 00:32.668
when I drag her down there.

00:33.238 --> 00:35.072
Here she is.

00:35.074 --> 00:37.007
Rosie?

00:38.476 --> 00:40.711
You slut! I'll kill you!

00:44.082 --> 00:46.249
Why didn't you ever call me?

00:46.251 --> 00:48.086
Why do you think?

00:48.087 --> 00:49.654
I was wracked with guilt.

00:49.655 --> 00:51.254
I was so stupid.

00:51.256 --> 00:52.990
You were 16.

00:52.991 --> 00:54.791
And stupid.

00:59.697 --> 01:01.833
You know my mom
hates drop-bys.

01:01.834 --> 01:04.068
It's not a drop-by.
It's a check-in.

01:04.069 --> 01:05.803
We haven't heard from
her in two days. Or...

01:05.804 --> 01:07.638
...we haven't
heard from her in two days.

01:07.639 --> 01:09.306
See? It's all in the way you
look at it.

01:09.308 --> 01:11.709
Since when are you so
worried about my mom?

01:11.710 --> 01:13.210
Since we're a month
behind on our book.

01:13.212 --> 01:14.312
After we're done writing,

01:14.313 --> 01:16.480
then let the postman
find her carcass.

01:16.481 --> 01:17.781
Wow.
Or...

01:17.783 --> 01:20.583
...then let
the postman find her carcass.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.121
There you are.

01:24.122 --> 01:26.189
What do you want?

01:26.191 --> 01:28.359
Uh, we're just
checking in on you.

01:28.360 --> 01:29.759
We don't need
to come in.

01:29.761 --> 01:30.461
Good.

01:30.462 --> 01:31.729
Uh...
See?

01:31.730 --> 01:32.963
She's still alive.
Let's go.

01:32.964 --> 01:34.098
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:34.099 --> 01:35.533
Did you hear that
music playing in there?

01:35.534 --> 01:37.334
Yeah. So?
She hates music.

01:37.335 --> 01:38.969
Unless it's coming
out of a pipe organ,

01:38.970 --> 01:40.738
she calls it "ear rape."

01:40.739 --> 01:43.873
Well, she uses that word a lot
when she really shouldn't.

01:43.875 --> 01:46.042
There's something
going on in there.

01:46.044 --> 01:48.178
Come on, Scooby-Doo,
let's not meddle.

01:48.179 --> 01:49.279
No... Is it a fella?

01:49.280 --> 01:50.948
Do you think she has
a fella in there?

01:50.949 --> 01:52.449
We have a book to finish.

01:52.450 --> 01:54.651
I don't have time for her
to go tom-catting around.

01:54.652 --> 01:56.253
"Fella?" "Tom-catting""

01:56.254 --> 01:58.955
You are spending too much
time with the elderly.

01:58.957 --> 02:00.491
What?

02:00.492 --> 02:01.491
Listen, Peggy,

02:01.493 --> 02:02.993
when we're done with the book,

02:02.994 --> 02:05.462
you can pitch woo with as many
gentleman callers as you'd like.

02:05.463 --> 02:07.930
But right now,
we got work to do.

02:07.932 --> 02:09.499
What are you talking about?

02:09.501 --> 02:11.401
Molly thinks you
got a guy in there.

02:11.402 --> 02:12.870
Who is it, Margaret?

02:12.871 --> 02:15.371
No judgment, Ma.
Have a nice time.

02:15.373 --> 02:17.841
Rosemary!

02:17.842 --> 02:20.043
Mike, this is
my sister, Rosemary.

02:20.044 --> 02:21.511
Rosemary,
your nephew, Mike.

02:21.512 --> 02:23.112
All right, good night.

02:23.114 --> 02:25.248
Aw, how about that?

02:25.249 --> 02:27.483
I finally got
to meet my aunt.

02:58.934 --> 03:00.933
And here's your cousin Colby.

03:00.934 --> 03:03.902
Only one of my six
who made it out of Mudlick.

03:03.904 --> 03:07.273
Lives in Plattsville,
five miles up the road.

03:07.274 --> 03:10.276
Hard to resist
the pull of a big city.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.545
Oh, I just can't
get over you.

03:12.546 --> 03:16.249
You got that chiseled jaw
and strong shoulders

03:16.250 --> 03:17.783
just like your grandma.

03:17.784 --> 03:18.951
Really?

03:18.952 --> 03:20.653
All my mom ever told me
about my shoulders

03:20.654 --> 03:22.654
is they almost killed her
on the way out.

03:22.656 --> 03:26.392
It was like giving birth
to a 14-pound biplane.

03:26.393 --> 03:30.296
I bet you were
a roly-poly lump of lovin'.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.431
I guess, yeah.

03:32.432 --> 03:34.066
Peggy, why didn't you tell us

03:34.067 --> 03:36.267
that Rosemary was coming
for a visit?

03:36.269 --> 03:38.671
I just wanted to make sure
she and I could both stand

03:38.672 --> 03:40.271
to be in the
same room together.

03:40.273 --> 03:42.441
Let the alphas sniff
each other's behinds

03:42.442 --> 03:45.311
before we let the rest
of the pack in.

03:45.312 --> 03:48.147
So, is everything...

03:48.148 --> 03:50.081
smelling okay?

03:50.083 --> 03:54.853
Well, the few whiffs we've had
have been downright pleasant.

03:54.854 --> 03:56.255
Oh, yeah.

03:56.256 --> 03:59.291
We were just playing records
and talking about old times.

03:59.292 --> 04:02.661
Remember seeing Patsy
Cline at the State Fair?

04:02.662 --> 04:05.064
I never went to the State Fair.

04:05.065 --> 04:06.098
Oh, that's right.

04:06.099 --> 04:07.499
Daddy just took me.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.000
You must have
been too young.

04:09.002 --> 04:11.402
Too young for rides
and cotton candy?

04:11.404 --> 04:12.604
Oh!

04:12.605 --> 04:15.874
Oh, there she is
after all these years.

04:15.875 --> 04:17.875
"Little Peggy
cries a lot.

04:17.877 --> 04:20.345
Always wants what
she don't got""

04:21.414 --> 04:22.881
I love that!

04:23.850 --> 04:25.416
You know, that it rhymes.

04:27.753 --> 04:29.254
All that's in the past.

04:29.255 --> 04:33.692
I'm just thankful I finally
got to meet this big, sweet

04:33.693 --> 04:34.860
honey bear!

04:34.861 --> 04:36.528
Oh!

04:36.529 --> 04:37.896
Wow, Molly,
now that's a hug.

04:37.897 --> 04:39.865
- You got to get in on this.
- I know.

04:39.866 --> 04:40.999
I had one in Mudlick.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.868
It's like rolling
in a pile of puppies.

04:42.869 --> 04:44.269
Oh, get in here!

04:44.270 --> 04:46.571
Oh!

04:46.572 --> 04:48.405
I'm good.

04:52.477 --> 04:54.546
When I met Aunt Rosemary,

04:54.547 --> 04:56.248
there was
an immediate connection.

04:56.249 --> 04:57.716
It's like we always
knew each other.

04:57.717 --> 04:59.917
I've never felt that way
about another person.

05:04.756 --> 05:06.591
Really?

05:06.592 --> 05:07.759
No one else?

05:07.760 --> 05:09.961
Ah, Carl.

05:09.962 --> 05:12.564
You just be careful with
this so-called aunt.

05:12.565 --> 05:14.065
What are you talking about?

05:14.066 --> 05:16.734
The only long-lost relative that
I ever came into contact with

05:16.735 --> 05:19.770
was some shady cousin
who wanted my kidney.

05:23.675 --> 05:25.409
She's not like that.

05:25.411 --> 05:26.577
Oh, you say that now,
but wait until you wake up

05:26.578 --> 05:27.979
in the middle of the night

05:27.980 --> 05:30.147
and she's drawing on your
stomach with a magic marker.

05:32.016 --> 05:33.318
Don't be ridiculous.

05:33.319 --> 05:35.286
Aunt Rosemary is sweet,
caring, understanding.

05:35.287 --> 05:36.721
And her hugs... oh.

05:36.722 --> 05:38.289
Nothing like hugging my mom.

05:38.290 --> 05:40.091
Yeah.

05:40.092 --> 05:41.359
Yeah, I hugged
your mom before.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.161
Like squeezing
a scarecrow.

05:43.162 --> 05:45.496
At least a scarecrow's warm

05:45.497 --> 05:47.398
from spending all day
in the sun.

05:48.801 --> 05:51.101
I just can't believe
those two women are sisters.

05:51.103 --> 05:52.904
Hey, what are you guys
talking about?

05:52.905 --> 05:55.373
Ah, I finally got
to meet my mother's sister.

05:55.374 --> 05:57.007
Does she want a kidney?

05:58.743 --> 06:01.344
No!

06:02.713 --> 06:04.815
my aunt is so loving

06:04.816 --> 06:07.852
it makes me wonder
how I would've turned out

06:07.853 --> 06:09.754
- if I was raised by her.
- Mm.

06:09.755 --> 06:12.456
See, now, that's classic
nature versus nurture.

06:12.457 --> 06:14.425
Now, are you are who you
are because of genetics,

06:14.426 --> 06:16.960
or are you the product
of your surroundings?

06:16.962 --> 06:18.429
See, I think
with a loving mother,

06:18.430 --> 06:19.730
he would have been
more confident.

06:19.731 --> 06:21.132
And more successful.

06:21.133 --> 06:22.999
Certainly thinner.

06:25.035 --> 06:27.805
And definitely better friends.

06:27.806 --> 06:29.073
Very snippy.

06:29.074 --> 06:30.974
See, that's learned
behavior right there.

06:36.380 --> 06:37.981
You know,
maybe for our vacation,

06:37.982 --> 06:39.416
we should go down to Mudlick.

06:39.417 --> 06:40.984
Mm, yeah, no.

06:40.985 --> 06:41.952
I've been there.

06:41.953 --> 06:44.655
It's not just a pretty name.

06:44.656 --> 06:46.156
So get this.

06:46.157 --> 06:47.424
I'm in the squad car today,

06:47.425 --> 06:48.592
and my cell phone rings.

06:48.593 --> 06:49.626
It's my mom's number,

06:49.627 --> 06:51.394
so I immediately get
that pit in my stomach.

06:51.396 --> 06:54.731
Ooh, the "Peggy pit," yeah.

06:54.732 --> 06:56.333
So I start thinking of excuses,

06:56.334 --> 06:58.602
you know, to cut the call short:
bad reception,

06:58.603 --> 07:00.504
or in the middle
of chasing an illegal.

07:00.505 --> 07:01.605
Ooh, that's a good one.

07:01.606 --> 07:03.373
Hitting her in the sweet spot.

07:03.374 --> 07:04.408
Yeah, but I didn't need to.

07:04.409 --> 07:05.709
Turns out it was
my Aunt Rosemary,

07:05.710 --> 07:06.710
just calling to say hi.

07:06.711 --> 07:07.678
No guilt trips,

07:07.679 --> 07:08.978
no complaining
about the neighbors.

07:08.980 --> 07:11.081
Just wanted to know
how my day was going.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.382
That is so nice.

07:12.383 --> 07:13.817
I know!

07:13.818 --> 07:15.619
D-Don't get me wrong,

07:15.620 --> 07:17.387
I love my mother,
blah, blah, blah.

07:17.388 --> 07:19.189
But can you
imagine growing up

07:19.190 --> 07:21.158
with a mom
like Rosemary?

07:21.159 --> 07:23.460
I tried. It's too painful.

07:23.461 --> 07:25.195
I didn't want to say
anything, but I snuck out

07:25.196 --> 07:27.196
and had coffee with her
this morning.

07:27.198 --> 07:29.232
Why didn't you call me?
You were at work.

07:29.233 --> 07:31.667
I'm sure we could've found
a crime nearby.

07:31.669 --> 07:32.969
I just wanted
to give her

07:32.970 --> 07:34.604
a few chapters of me
and Peggy's book to read.

07:34.605 --> 07:36.172
You know, get a fresh
view on Mudlick

07:36.173 --> 07:38.074
from a current
Mudlicker.

07:38.075 --> 07:39.509
I'll bet she'll love it.

07:39.510 --> 07:41.277
She'll tell you
you did a wonderful job,

07:41.278 --> 07:44.147
and if people don't like it,
they're just jealous.

07:44.148 --> 07:46.916
God, I wish I heard
that growing up.

07:46.917 --> 07:49.586
All I got was "find out if
your teacher thinks I'm hot""

07:58.795 --> 08:00.063
Hi, Peggy.

08:00.064 --> 08:01.297
What are you
doing here?

08:01.298 --> 08:02.665
Oh, we were just in
the neighborhood,

08:02.666 --> 08:04.500
thought we'd stop
and see Aunt Rosemary.

08:04.501 --> 08:05.468
And you.

08:05.469 --> 08:08.104
'Cause you're here, too.

08:08.105 --> 08:09.939
You didn't call ahead,

08:09.940 --> 08:12.575
so no warning, no bra,
no complaints.

08:12.576 --> 08:15.445
No problem, no looking.

08:15.446 --> 08:17.547
Oh, hey, Molly.
Hey!

08:17.548 --> 08:19.749
There's my sweet nephew.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.717
Oh! Ooh!

08:21.718 --> 08:23.619
Ooh, we're stuck.

08:23.620 --> 08:24.921
I can't let go.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.556
I don't know what
we're gonna do.

08:26.557 --> 08:29.124
I guess we'll just
have to keep hugging!

08:29.126 --> 08:32.027
All right, break it up.
This ain't France.

08:32.029 --> 08:34.530
Oh, thank you
for letting me read this.

08:34.530 --> 08:36.899
Some very interesting things
in here.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.267
In where?

08:38.268 --> 08:40.269
I gave her the last few
chapters of our book.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.171
What'd you do that for?

08:42.172 --> 08:44.206
Well, it might be
your life story, Peggy,

08:44.207 --> 08:45.474
but she lived it, too.

08:45.475 --> 08:48.811
I'm sorry, dear,
but I didn't live any of this.

08:48.812 --> 08:50.546
And you didn't
either, Peggy.

08:50.547 --> 08:51.914
What are you
talking about?

08:51.915 --> 08:53.516
Every word in
there is true.

08:53.517 --> 08:55.016
Oh, nonsense.

08:55.018 --> 08:57.119
You make it out
like we were raised in hell

08:57.120 --> 08:58.753
by the Devil himself.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.756
That farm <i> was</i> my hell.

09:00.757 --> 09:03.759
All I know
is you'll never be happy

09:03.760 --> 09:06.428
if you only look
at the negative in things.

09:06.429 --> 09:07.930
I see what I see.

09:07.931 --> 09:11.500
At least I'm not some Pollyanna
living in denial.

09:11.501 --> 09:14.736
All right, ladies,
let's not argue.

09:14.738 --> 09:18.373
Yeah, let's just go put on our
bras and have a nice visit.

09:18.375 --> 09:20.075
Look, if you want
to blame the world

09:20.076 --> 09:22.077
for how you turned out,
that's your business.

09:22.078 --> 09:25.013
But based on what I read, we
grew up in two different houses.

09:25.014 --> 09:26.815
So I'm a liar?
No.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.417
You're bitter and spiteful,

09:28.418 --> 09:31.420
and you have no one to blame
for who you are but yourself.

09:31.421 --> 09:33.522
Get out!

09:33.523 --> 09:36.158
Peggy.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.826
Happy to.

09:39.562 --> 09:41.495
What is wrong with you?

09:41.497 --> 09:42.965
Only you could manage
to throw the nicest woman

09:42.966 --> 09:44.265
in the world out of your house.

09:44.267 --> 09:47.002
If she's so wonderful,
why don't you join her?

09:47.003 --> 09:48.337
Ugh, alienate everybody, Ma.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.605
That's why all your stories end
with you alone.

09:50.606 --> 09:52.808
I'm gonna go help her pack;
she can stay with us.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.376
Come on.

09:54.377 --> 09:57.979
Peggy, you don't want
your sister to leave.

09:57.980 --> 09:59.648
She's not my sister.

09:59.649 --> 10:01.582
I don't have a sister anymore.

10:05.453 --> 10:07.955
You go see if she's okay.

10:11.826 --> 10:14.028
I get it.

10:26.377 --> 10:29.013
More fresh biscuits.

10:29.014 --> 10:30.948
Who's ready?

10:30.949 --> 10:33.449
I'd love to,
but sadly I'm full.

10:35.252 --> 10:38.455
Oh, wait, it was just the table
cinching my stomach.

10:38.456 --> 10:40.623
I got room.

10:41.892 --> 10:44.561
No offense, Mom,
but I did not realize until now

10:44.562 --> 10:46.063
what a horrible
cook you are.

10:46.064 --> 10:47.364
Oh...

10:47.365 --> 10:48.732
none taken.

10:48.733 --> 10:50.634
Rosemary, I know
this is sudden,

10:50.635 --> 10:53.569
but will you marry us?

10:54.738 --> 10:56.406
I'd get down on one knee,
but at this point

10:56.407 --> 10:59.175
I don't think I'd be able
to get back up again.

10:59.177 --> 11:01.878
That's flattering,
but the only threesome I know

11:01.879 --> 11:05.015
that ever worked were
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

11:05.016 --> 11:07.883
Let's agree to disagree.

11:10.854 --> 11:12.289
Mike, come on.

11:12.290 --> 11:14.825
I just think it would be a good
idea if you made up with her.

11:14.826 --> 11:16.293
She's your mother.

11:16.294 --> 11:18.595
Oh, no, you're just trying to
throw me into the lion's den

11:18.596 --> 11:20.797
so she doesn't
eat you alive.

11:20.798 --> 11:23.099
Yes!

11:23.100 --> 11:25.434
She's miserable
even when she's happy.

11:25.436 --> 11:27.537
Look, I could spend all
day worrying about her,

11:27.538 --> 11:30.540
or I can enjoy the day
getting to know my aunt.

11:30.541 --> 11:33.510
One is causing me grief,
one is making me pancakes.

11:33.511 --> 11:36.212
It ain't exactly
<i> Sophie's Choice.</i>

11:36.213 --> 11:38.747
Vince, tap out! I'm up!

11:43.319 --> 11:45.388
Maybe we should start going
over some of the stuff

11:45.389 --> 11:46.723
we've already written.

11:46.724 --> 11:49.459
You know, just make sure
it still rings true.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.895
So you think I'm a liar, too.

11:51.896 --> 11:53.596
Wha...?

11:53.597 --> 11:54.831
No, I don't.

11:54.832 --> 11:56.900
But memory is
a funny thing.

11:56.901 --> 11:58.934
You know, last week,
I could've sworn

11:58.936 --> 12:00.870
that I pulled that nozzle
out of the gas tank

12:00.871 --> 12:02.372
before I drove away.

12:02.373 --> 12:03.640
And then I get home,

12:03.641 --> 12:07.243
and I see ten feet of hose
dangling from my car,

12:07.244 --> 12:11.546
and I had to tell myself,
"I may have remembered wrong."

12:12.582 --> 12:16.318
Hey, you may be an idiot,
but I'm not a liar.

12:18.121 --> 12:19.822
You know, I'm trying
to help you here.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.157
You make it very hard.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.925
I don't need help
from anybody.

12:22.926 --> 12:25.194
Let's just finish the damn book
and be done with it.

12:25.195 --> 12:26.896
Fine.
This is my story.

12:26.897 --> 12:28.531
I know what went on
in that house.

12:28.532 --> 12:30.199
You lived it.
Exactly.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.336
Let's just forget about
Rosemary and get writing.

12:33.337 --> 12:34.737
Great.

12:34.738 --> 12:37.239
Rosemary was always
the perfect one.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.941
Always said
the right thing,

12:38.942 --> 12:39.909
got good grades.

12:39.910 --> 12:41.544
You know what it's like
to grow up

12:41.545 --> 12:43.812
in the shadow
of a sister like that?

12:45.081 --> 12:47.348
I kind of am that sister.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.120
Maybe I was to blame.

12:51.121 --> 12:53.856
I never made it easy
for people to love me.

12:53.857 --> 12:56.525
Daddy said I was born sour.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.994
I guess he was right.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.396
You're not sour.

13:00.397 --> 13:04.433
You're... tangy.

13:04.434 --> 13:05.768
Don't sugarcoat it.

13:05.769 --> 13:07.636
I'm a big pain in the ass.

13:07.637 --> 13:10.505
Nobody wants
to be around that.

13:18.680 --> 13:21.283
Ah, I got to stop
feeling sorry for myself.

13:21.284 --> 13:22.784
We got a book
to write.

13:22.785 --> 13:27.189
You know what, if it helps,
I do believe you.

13:27.190 --> 13:28.557
Thanks.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.057
It doesn't.

13:32.494 --> 13:35.029
There's that tang!

13:42.771 --> 13:44.039
Watch his cowlick.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.108
That thing loves to pop
up like a prairie dog.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.411
You know, we're supposed
to spend the day together,

13:49.412 --> 13:50.946
not run my errands.

13:50.947 --> 13:52.914
Oh, honey, this
is a joy for me.

13:52.915 --> 13:56.218
Taking care of my nephew,
seeing where he works.

13:56.219 --> 13:57.953
Boy, they sure did love you
down at the precinct.

13:57.954 --> 13:59.121
The captain of the SWAT team

13:59.122 --> 14:01.523
wants your recipe
for snickerdoodles.

14:01.524 --> 14:04.326
I can't believe all those boys
thought I was your mother.

14:04.327 --> 14:08.196
I look nothing like her.

14:08.197 --> 14:11.333
Well, I think the confusion is
that they've never met her.

14:11.334 --> 14:13.234
Ten years on the force,

14:13.235 --> 14:15.537
and you never brought Peggy
to see where you work?

14:15.538 --> 14:17.706
Well, they like me there;
I don't want to mess that up.

14:18.708 --> 14:20.475
You know,
it's a shame it took us

14:20.476 --> 14:22.644
all these years to
finally connect.

14:22.645 --> 14:24.612
Yeah, you'd think Mom could have
swallowed her pride

14:24.613 --> 14:26.948
and took me down there
to meet you just once.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.616
Well, don't be
too hard on her.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.352
She's always
been stubborn.

14:31.353 --> 14:32.987
And holds a grudge, too.

14:32.988 --> 14:34.422
A lady at church
made the mistake

14:34.423 --> 14:36.157
of buying the same hat
as her.

14:36.158 --> 14:37.959
She glared at her every Sunday

14:37.960 --> 14:41.062
until that woman
became a Lutheran.

14:41.063 --> 14:43.064
Oh, I know all about
that side of her.

14:43.065 --> 14:45.733
The Christmas I got a bike,
she got sheets for her bed.

14:45.734 --> 14:47.568
You'd think
the world was ending.

14:47.569 --> 14:51.773
Well, um, sheets are kind of
a crappy Christmas present.

14:51.774 --> 14:54.075
Yeah, that's what
"Peggy cries-a-lot" said.

14:54.076 --> 14:55.576
Felt so sorry
for herself.

14:55.577 --> 14:58.246
If we hadn't ignored
her little pity party,

14:58.247 --> 15:01.048
it would've ruined Christmas
for everybody.

15:01.049 --> 15:04.318
Well, wasn't Christmas
kind of ruined for her?

15:04.319 --> 15:06.254
Well, it was her own fault.

15:06.255 --> 15:08.322
If she'd just smiled
every once in a while

15:08.323 --> 15:10.958
and appreciated
what she did have,

15:10.959 --> 15:12.927
maybe I wouldn't have
been the only one

15:12.928 --> 15:14.261
Daddy took to Patsy Cline

15:14.262 --> 15:17.497
or gave a horse to
for graduating grade school.

15:17.499 --> 15:20.968
Well, that doesn't
seem exactly fair.

15:20.969 --> 15:23.604
Well, life ain't fair.

15:23.605 --> 15:25.606
That's what Daddy
always told Peggy.

15:25.607 --> 15:28.242
And if she ain't learned
that yet, she never will.

15:28.243 --> 15:30.244
That explains a lot.

15:30.245 --> 15:32.213
My goodness.

15:32.214 --> 15:36.082
With this buzz cut, you look
even more like your grandma.

15:38.953 --> 15:40.955
Peggy, don't get
down about today.

15:40.956 --> 15:43.691
Some days, you give
me 20 pages of gold,

15:43.692 --> 15:46.627
and, well, sometimes you...

15:46.628 --> 15:50.297
The point is, just don't get
too down about it.

15:50.298 --> 15:51.899
I'm not.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.433
I blame you.

15:55.903 --> 15:57.571
Hey.

15:57.572 --> 15:59.006
What do you want?

15:59.007 --> 16:01.608
To talk.

16:01.609 --> 16:03.744
Can you give us
a minute, sweetie?

16:03.745 --> 16:05.512
Oh. Yeah, sure.

16:05.513 --> 16:08.414
I'll... I'll just be
in the kitchen.

16:09.883 --> 16:12.084
I am gonna listen. I just...

16:14.154 --> 16:16.956
I just want to be
up front about that.

16:20.727 --> 16:22.029
Listen, uh...

16:22.030 --> 16:24.698
I-I don't want to rehash
what happened last night.

16:24.699 --> 16:28.735
You mean where you backstabbed
me by siding with my sister?

16:28.736 --> 16:31.938
Yeah, that's the part
I didn't want to rehash.

16:31.939 --> 16:33.640
I saw how you were
with her.

16:33.641 --> 16:34.674
Ma...

16:34.675 --> 16:36.776
No, I get it.

16:36.777 --> 16:39.446
Rosemary's easy to love,
always has been.

16:39.447 --> 16:42.983
But we are who we are.

16:42.984 --> 16:45.118
It's not your fault.
No?

16:45.119 --> 16:47.787
Maybe it is,
but I don't care.

16:47.788 --> 16:51.291
I might be a tough
nasty piece of gristle,

16:51.292 --> 16:54.961
but whatever I was, whatever
I did, somehow it made you.

16:54.962 --> 16:57.496
And I wouldn't change that
for the world.

16:59.866 --> 17:01.867
Neither would I.

17:10.310 --> 17:12.377
There you go,
now squeeze.

17:12.378 --> 17:14.012
I feel ridiculous.

17:17.317 --> 17:19.719
You'll get used to it.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.722
Incoming!

17:34.050 --> 17:38.019
All right, and this
is our precinct room.

17:38.021 --> 17:39.388
Everybody, this
is my mother.

17:39.390 --> 17:41.157
Well, who was
the other lady?

17:41.158 --> 17:43.759
Like I said,<i> this</i>
is my mother.

17:43.761 --> 17:45.695
Hey.

17:45.696 --> 17:47.629
Which one's Kilpatrick?

17:47.631 --> 17:49.165
He always gives me
the brush off

17:49.166 --> 17:51.300
when I call about
the hippie neighbors.

17:51.301 --> 17:54.302
Always parking their commie
Prius in front of my house.

17:54.304 --> 17:56.571
Uh, yeah, he-he's
got the day off.

17:57.406 --> 17:59.509
Nice to see you,
Mother Biggs.

17:59.510 --> 18:00.843
Hello, Carlton.

18:03.179 --> 18:05.081
Oh, somebody's
been practicing.

18:06.116 --> 18:08.883
Okay, it's not
a dance marathon.

18:08.885 --> 18:10.219
All right, we
should get going.

18:10.220 --> 18:11.887
We need to get you
your mug shot,

18:11.888 --> 18:14.289
and let you badger the drunks
down in the holding tank.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.191
You are good
to your mother.
