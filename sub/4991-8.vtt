WEBVTT

00:00.267 --> 00:03.170
Oh, man, I just did not
get a lot of sleep after
that earthquake last night.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.238
Yeah, me neither.

00:04.238 --> 00:06.039
I got to meet
my neighbors, though.

00:06.039 --> 00:07.040
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.343
There was one guy who had
a whole bunch of my old
credit card receipts.

00:09.343 --> 00:12.980
And how cool is that?
It's like a super fan.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.982
And how's Roxie?
She okay?

00:14.982 --> 00:16.984
She slept through
the whole thing.

00:16.984 --> 00:18.185
That's her pure heart.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.353
No worries
to keep her awake.

00:19.353 --> 00:23.090
Well, it's either
that or the 48 hours
of straight partying.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.292
(chuckles)
That girl knows
how to live life.

00:25.292 --> 00:27.160
Sleeping her day away.

00:28.262 --> 00:31.064
"Sorry, closed today.
Earthquake damage."

00:31.064 --> 00:33.033
Yeah, all right!

00:33.033 --> 00:35.102
That's a paid day off
right there.

00:35.102 --> 00:37.337
But you know what?
Promise I'm not gonna
waste this one.

00:37.337 --> 00:40.173
See, there was a power
outage back in January

00:40.173 --> 00:42.342
and I spent the whole day
trying to peel an orange
in one piece.

00:44.077 --> 00:45.345
Closest I got
was 12 pieces.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.080
That's pretty good.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.148
(phone buzzes)

00:48.148 --> 00:49.383
-It's from Patti.
-Ah.

00:49.383 --> 00:53.320
"Earthquake damage.
Handyman me.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.355
"Will pay you
with a fat Franklin."

00:55.355 --> 00:58.325
Hope that means 100 bucks
and not a sex position.

00:58.325 --> 00:59.393
Ha! Right?

00:59.393 --> 01:01.028
-You're sick.
-Come on.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.062
-But I like it.
-Yeah.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.330
Um, anyway, I got--

01:03.330 --> 01:05.132
-I got some big news.
-Oh, yeah?

01:05.132 --> 01:07.134
I got contacted by this
headhunter who wanted to know

01:07.134 --> 01:08.302
if I was interested
in a new job.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.103
-Cool.
-Yeah, might be out of town.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.371
And I might be getting
pissed off right now, Kev.

01:11.371 --> 01:13.407
Don't you dare put me
on this roller coaster again.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.076
Man, I gotta at least hear
what she has to offer, right?

01:16.076 --> 01:18.278
I'm gonna video chat
with her later this morning.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.180
What about Audrey?

01:20.180 --> 01:24.051
Ever since my big stand,
she's just backed right off.
You know?

01:24.051 --> 01:26.119
Unless, of course,
she's reminding me

01:26.119 --> 01:27.421
that she has a boyfriend.
It's incessant.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.422
Brock thinks...

01:28.422 --> 01:30.157
Brock says... Brock did...

01:30.157 --> 01:32.159
Brock... Brock... Brock...

01:32.159 --> 01:36.129
So, if she's doubling down
on Brock, then I might as well
be somewhere else.

01:36.129 --> 01:37.331
But, hey, you know,

01:37.331 --> 01:39.299
at least you and Roxie
will have each other.

01:39.299 --> 01:42.235
Nah, no we won't.
Not in a biblical sense.

01:42.235 --> 01:44.137
Meaning, like, we wouldn't...

01:44.137 --> 01:45.372
go to church
together because...

01:45.372 --> 01:49.376
that girl isn't...
built for church.

01:49.376 --> 01:52.079
I'm gonna walk
you to chur-- work.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.213
-Let's go on to work again.
-Okay.

01:53.213 --> 01:55.082
(theme music plays)

01:55.082 --> 01:56.216
<i>♪ Because it's all good ♪</i>

01:56.216 --> 01:59.186
<i>♪ It's all, all,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

01:59.186 --> 02:01.088
<i>♪ Uh-huh, yup, it's all good ♪</i>

02:01.088 --> 02:03.223
<i>♪ Uh-huh, uh-huh,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

02:04.358 --> 02:06.159
<i>♪ Because it's all good ♪</i>

02:06.159 --> 02:08.161
<i>♪ It's all, all,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

02:08.161 --> 02:10.330
<i>♪ Uh-huh, yup, it's all good ♪</i>

02:12.199 --> 02:13.233
Have a good one.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.103
Oh, Kevin!

02:16.103 --> 02:17.204
That was some earthquake
last night.

02:17.204 --> 02:19.239
Sorry, I promised Brock
I'd call him when I got
to work safely.

02:19.239 --> 02:20.440
So, excuse me.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.342
(phone rings)

02:30.117 --> 02:32.119
Julia's not coming in
because of the earthquake.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.320
She had structural damage.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.454
One of her boobs popped.

02:34.454 --> 02:37.124
-Oh.
-So, we have to do
an earthquake drill without her.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.158
Corporate mandate.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.360
I thought you should know
since you're earthquake captain.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.461
What? Why? Since when?

02:41.461 --> 02:43.363
Apparently, when you applied
to work here,

02:43.363 --> 02:47.100
you listed CPR certified
on your resume
under special skills.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.102
We await your orders.

02:49.102 --> 02:52.239
Kind of ironic since under
special skills

02:52.239 --> 02:54.441
I put "extensive knowledge
of plate tectonics."

02:54.441 --> 02:56.276
But, whatever.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.413
Roxie, what are
you doing here?

02:59.413 --> 03:02.149
Did you know that there was
an earthquake last night?

03:02.149 --> 03:04.484
Yes, I did. It woke me
right up.

03:04.484 --> 03:08.255
Well, when I woke up
an hour ago, the freakiest
thing happened.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.489
You know that cinnamon-scented
candle I have?

03:09.489 --> 03:12.459
You know, the one that I use
to cover up the smells of
sweaty, steamy--

03:12.459 --> 03:14.528
Know the candle.
Did not know its purpose.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.464
Well, it was shattered!
Glass all over my floor.

03:17.464 --> 03:20.367
Thank God that lady I call
to clean the apartment sometimes

03:20.367 --> 03:22.135
swept it up
before I got out of bed.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.504
So, you're okay,
and you'll get a new candle,

03:24.504 --> 03:26.506
and you'll never tell me
what it's for again.

03:26.506 --> 03:28.341
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.342
Where are you going?

03:29.342 --> 03:32.412
I have to go organize this
earthquake drill, which could
not come at a worse time.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.314
But I'm just gonna
power through.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.416
What are you doing?

03:36.416 --> 03:38.251
I don't know.

03:38.251 --> 03:41.488
Some weird sibling instinct
deep in my brain

03:41.488 --> 03:43.290
told me to reach out
to you.

03:43.290 --> 03:44.491
Hmm.

03:44.491 --> 03:47.227
And now, another instinct
is telling me to let go

03:47.227 --> 03:49.229
'cause your hand
is like a sweaty meat pie.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.464
Thank you.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.199
Wait, I love you, though.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.301
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

03:54.301 --> 03:56.503
But Patti didn't send you
that text. I sent it
from her phone.

03:56.503 --> 03:59.272
Oh. That's cool.

03:59.272 --> 04:01.174
I'm no stranger
to false pretenses.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.477
There is a crack in the plaster
in the bedroom.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.412
I told Patti I would fix it.
I cannot.

04:05.412 --> 04:09.349
And, I'm afraid after last
night Patti may be questioning
my manhood.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.218
-(rumbling)
-Dev: What's that?

04:11.218 --> 04:13.553
-It's an earthquake.
It's an earthquake!
-(car alarms blaring)

04:13.553 --> 04:16.189
Aah! I'm not ready to die!

04:16.189 --> 04:17.557
It was not my finest hour.

04:17.557 --> 04:19.426
Okay. Here's what we do.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.494
I'm gonna fix
the plaster. Okay?

04:20.494 --> 04:22.562
But then you're gonna
take a selfie and you're
gonna send it to her

04:22.562 --> 04:24.431
to make it look like
you did it yourself.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.499
Oh, thank you.
That's brilliant.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.533
What do I owe you?

04:26.533 --> 04:28.502
Oh, no, brother, look,
look, this is bigger than money.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.303
Okay, we're not just
rebuilding a wall.

04:30.303 --> 04:32.205
We're rebuilding a man.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.573
I'm gonna teach
you everything.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.542
I should not be tearing up,
should I?

04:35.542 --> 04:37.410
No.

04:39.246 --> 04:41.281
'Cause you know, if you do,
then I might.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.315
-Right?
-Yeah.

04:42.315 --> 04:43.483
-And we gotta stay
strong, right?
-Yeah.

04:43.483 --> 04:44.551
-It's man time!
-Yeah.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.419
-Man time!
-Man time!

04:46.419 --> 04:48.488
-Now follow me into
the bedroom, man.
-Okay.

04:48.488 --> 04:51.424
We're the smart ones, right?

04:51.424 --> 04:55.428
Day after an earthquake.
Short lines.

04:55.428 --> 04:59.366
I'm just here to get
my driver's license
photo retaken.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.236
I know, right?

05:03.236 --> 05:05.472
And it's so annoying
when someone cards you
and they look at the picture,

05:05.472 --> 05:07.507
and then they look at me,
and you know they're thinking,

05:07.507 --> 05:10.310
"But you're so beautiful,
and that picture is so average."

05:10.310 --> 05:12.546
(laughing)

05:16.316 --> 05:18.385
So, how'd your man act
during the earthquake?

05:18.385 --> 05:21.454
Oh, he ran to my side
and he threw himself
over me.

05:21.454 --> 05:24.324
Why would you say
something like that?

05:24.324 --> 05:27.327
(phone buzzing)

05:27.327 --> 05:29.329
(scoffs)

05:29.329 --> 05:30.363
Hey, look at this.

05:30.363 --> 05:31.531
So, now he's a man?

05:31.531 --> 05:34.234
This does not undo
all the screaming, okay?

05:34.234 --> 05:36.369
If you're gonna be yelling
about the big one
in the bedroom,

05:36.369 --> 05:39.306
it had better be about something
other than an earthquake,
am I right?

05:39.306 --> 05:40.507
I think it's sweet.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.309
You're oh-for-two, lady.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.344
It's not sweet.
It's sad.

05:48.582 --> 05:52.452
Okay. "There has been
an earthquake, magnitude 6.2--"

05:52.452 --> 05:53.620
Roxie, what are you
still doing here?

05:53.620 --> 05:55.288
I don't know.
I mean,

05:55.288 --> 05:58.358
I should be mercilessly
mocking you for being
an earthquake captain,

05:58.358 --> 06:01.628
and yet, I feel like
I don't want to leave you
and your stupid ugly vest.

06:01.628 --> 06:05.465
Oh, that's so nice,
but I actually don't have
time for this right now.

06:05.465 --> 06:08.468
Kevin, I could have died
in the earthquake today!

06:08.468 --> 06:11.338
Or worse,
the guy with the gross
comb-over, who lives upstairs,

06:11.338 --> 06:13.473
could have fallen through
the ceiling and pinned me
for hours.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.343
Okay, I've told you before,
that's not a guy. Her name
is Candy, and she has--

06:16.343 --> 06:17.544
Life is too short!

06:17.544 --> 06:20.447
And I realize that I haven't
always been the sister
that I should be,

06:20.447 --> 06:23.350
but I wanna change that now.

06:23.350 --> 06:26.286
Oh my God,
what is happening to me?

06:27.354 --> 06:28.655
Sounds like you're
having an epiphany.

06:28.655 --> 06:33.393
The same thing happened to me
at Souplantation when I saw
them rotate the potato salad.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.527
I realized

06:34.527 --> 06:36.630
you can't sit around
and wait for someone else

06:36.630 --> 06:39.332
to hide the slimy film
covering your life.

06:39.332 --> 06:43.670
Girl, you need to rotate
that potato salad yo-self.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.672
Oh, my God.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.574
You're right!

06:47.574 --> 06:50.310
I am having an epiphany.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.611
This is amazing.

06:51.611 --> 06:54.614
God, I feel like I need
to share this feeling
with other people.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.384
This says I need
to assign injuries to people.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.452
Someone will have to play
emergency personnel.

06:59.452 --> 07:03.456
We have to designate
a triage area and show people
how to use water purifiers.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.392
I mean, is there
a shorter practice drill?

07:05.392 --> 07:06.459
I don't know, Kevin.

07:06.459 --> 07:09.629
Let's ask the survivors
of the great 1906
San Francisco earthquake

07:09.629 --> 07:11.331
where we should cut corners.

07:11.331 --> 07:12.399
I think they're all dead.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.501
Exactly.

07:14.501 --> 07:17.404
I'll be first responder.

07:17.404 --> 07:19.539
Ooh! Spinal cord injury.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.608
Hey, I hear
you're an actress.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.543
I may need your help
with my lines later.

07:23.543 --> 07:26.446
(drawling)
And an accent, y'all.

07:28.581 --> 07:30.450
Right.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.353
Oh. I didn't know
you were in here.

07:33.353 --> 07:34.688
-I was just going to--
-Checking on Brock?

07:34.688 --> 07:36.356
Well, yes.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.358
I mean, he is
my long-term boyfriend.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.427
Of course. Of course he is.
We'll leave you to it.`

07:40.427 --> 07:41.695
Okay.

07:44.564 --> 07:47.367
Wait. Did something happen
between you guys?
You seemed at her?

07:47.367 --> 07:48.601
No, I'm not mad.
I'm just tense.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.570
Wait. Why are you tense?

07:50.570 --> 07:52.672
Listen, this is
post-epiphany Roxie.

07:52.672 --> 07:55.542
You can tell me anything.
I'm totes reliable.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.344
Okay, look.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.346
I haven't told anyone here,

07:59.346 --> 08:00.747
but I'm actually looking
for a new job.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.449
-(gasps)
-Yeah.

08:02.449 --> 08:05.719
I have to find a place
to have a video interview
with a headhunter at 11:00,

08:05.719 --> 08:07.520
so that's why I'm racing
through this drill.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.622
Oh, did you just
tell me a secret?

08:09.622 --> 08:10.757
Oh my God,
I think I did.

08:10.757 --> 08:14.694
Oh, we just moved
our sib relationship
to a new level.

08:14.694 --> 08:17.630
Is there anything else
you wanna tell me?

08:17.630 --> 08:19.733
No, let's just
keep it to the one.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.635
Baby steps. Okay.
I can do that.

08:24.471 --> 08:25.638
Okay, people,
you all know what to do.

08:25.638 --> 08:26.706
Let's keep this
short and sweet.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.641
The earthquake has started.

08:28.641 --> 08:31.578
Aah!

08:31.578 --> 08:33.680
Hmm. She's actually
pretty good.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.648
It's just a drill.

08:35.648 --> 08:39.719
Um, I need you all to get
under your desks now.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.654
Great!

08:41.654 --> 08:45.492
And the first responders
should have arrived by now.

08:45.492 --> 08:46.760
Mmm, probably not yet.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.995
I'd be back at
the firehouse making chili.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.531
Everyone loves my recipe.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.632
Fine.

08:52.632 --> 08:55.435
And shaking, shaking, shaking!

08:55.435 --> 08:57.737
And the earthquake is over,
and you've all survived.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.539
-Congratulations.
-(applause)

08:59.539 --> 09:01.674
Great, now head to the stairs.

09:01.674 --> 09:06.413
(on bullhorn)
Good job! I will meet
you all outside!

09:06.413 --> 09:08.982
Okay, first responder
is here now.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.551
Ooh, shouldn't have had
that last helping of chili.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.720
Speaking of,
this scene is gruesome!

09:13.720 --> 09:16.756
If this was a 6.2 thrust fault
quake centered in the Valley,

09:16.756 --> 09:19.626
30% injuries, 10% casualties.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.628
Ricky, you have no way
of knowing that.

09:21.628 --> 09:23.696
I think Ricky is just trying
his best to help

09:23.696 --> 09:25.565
and wants to feel appreciated.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.435
I wasn't even aware of that,
but you're probably right.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.436
Hmm.

09:29.436 --> 09:30.737
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.606
So, now you're
talking to me, huh?

09:33.606 --> 09:35.575
I haven't been
not talking to you.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.444
I mean, we're still
friends, Kevin.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.646
You know, I don't have time
for this push and pull thing
that you do, so--

09:39.646 --> 09:41.014
I don't do that.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.716
Brock is really gonna
find that hilarious.

09:43.716 --> 09:45.452
Fine. You wanna be helpful?

09:45.452 --> 09:46.719
Yes, of course.
I'm a helpful person.

09:46.719 --> 09:48.488
Well, we could use
another injury.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.590
So, let's see.
You have a...

09:50.590 --> 09:51.758
Massive head injury.

09:51.758 --> 09:55.028
So, you should find triage,
which is just outside.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.597
-I think I would be more
helpful if I just--
-Mmm.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.533
Probably can't talk
with a massive head injury.

10:01.968 --> 10:03.736
Thank you for broadening
your man lessons with me.

10:03.736 --> 10:05.572
There's a lot of stuff
to fix around here,

10:05.572 --> 10:07.474
and I don't know the first thing
about plumbing.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.042
Ah. No problem, man.

10:09.042 --> 10:12.479
Um... You got YouTube here?

10:12.479 --> 10:16.015
You took it apart
and you have no idea
how to proceed?

10:16.015 --> 10:18.718
I just impressed Patti.
I do not want to unimpress her.

10:18.718 --> 10:21.054
Shh. Look, don't worry.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.489
I'm gonna call my guy.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.656
(doorbell rings)

10:23.656 --> 10:25.758
I'm Hank.
Brian's guy.

10:25.758 --> 10:28.695
How about the three of us
get busy in the bathroom?

10:31.564 --> 10:33.666
Kevin:
I don't know if you're gonna
live. It's too early to tell.

10:33.666 --> 10:37.604
(on bullhorn)
If you are a a first responder,
find your injury buddy.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.606
If you are deceased,
lay down.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.574
Can we please speed this up?!

10:41.574 --> 10:44.577
People are torn about which
of my post-epiphany selfies
are better.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.080
Ugh. If only they
had my clarity.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.517
Uh, by the way,
people couldn't identify
what accent I was using,

10:50.517 --> 10:52.051
so I settled on
a nervous tic.

10:54.053 --> 10:56.089
-I don't see it?
-My character's
taking meds for it.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.590
It's working.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.092
Kevin:
Guess what, Gus?

10:59.092 --> 11:03.530
You couldn't be walking around
trying to bum cigarettes with
a shattered pelvis, could you?

11:03.530 --> 11:05.732
Okay, I get it.
You're mad at me.

11:05.732 --> 11:08.735
But I've had my head cradled
in Simon's lap for 20 minutes.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.603
Consider your revenge complete.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.505
So, you should put me
to work, or I'm going home.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.640
Why would I want revenge?

11:13.640 --> 11:16.643
Because I didn't respond
to your big speech about how
we're destined to be together.

11:16.643 --> 11:17.644
And I'm okay with that.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.078
Then why are you
acting like a jerk?

11:19.078 --> 11:20.647
I'm a jerk?

11:20.647 --> 11:22.549
I'm the guy who let you
use my birthday

11:22.549 --> 11:25.585
when your lovey-dovey approach
to managing the office failed.

11:25.585 --> 11:28.655
I let you stay with me
when you were tired
of being at Brock's.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.657
I even saved your life.

11:30.657 --> 11:33.126
So, excuse me for bristling
every time you say "Brock"

11:33.126 --> 11:35.028
-like he's some kind
of karate God.
-Jiu-jitsu!

11:35.028 --> 11:36.996
Whatever! It's all just
barefoot guys in pajamas.

11:36.996 --> 11:38.031
I should be your God.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.567
That last part came out
super obnoxious.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.602
And the pajamas thing
was even a bit harsh.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.604
What are they fighting about?

11:44.604 --> 11:46.539
Who knows.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.541
Whoa. Did you see it?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.043
-What?
-I just did the tic.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.578
Almost imperceptible,

11:51.578 --> 11:55.081
but yet says so much about
my character's stress level
of being a first responder.

11:55.081 --> 11:57.550
(gasps)
Damn.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.053
Did I turn the chili off
back at the station?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.689
Look, all of us,
everybody here,

12:02.689 --> 12:05.758
we all know that
you have a boyfriend, okay?

12:05.758 --> 12:08.061
I'm not sure
you always know.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.700
I don't like
the way she talks to him.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.970
Listen to me.

12:16.970 --> 12:20.640
Hashtag empathy,
hashtag the new me.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.979
Huh. We have a gas pipe here.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.981
Sorry, I don't work
with gas.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.682
Patti will be home soon.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.751
No worries.
I got a guy.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.588
I'm Hank's guy.
I do gas.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.124
And I brought my electrics guy.
You know, just in case.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.692
Smart.

12:45.064 --> 12:47.734
If only one of them
had a belt guy.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.636
This is a big
earthquake people!

12:49.636 --> 12:53.973
LAX has been destroyed,
the Hollywood sign is on fire!

12:53.973 --> 12:55.742
Ricky, what are you doing
with my bullhorn?

12:55.742 --> 12:57.176
And why would the Hollywood
sign be on fire?

12:57.176 --> 13:00.980
Don't worry about
my use of iconic imagery
for dramatic effect, okay?

13:00.980 --> 13:02.649
Just worry about
your big interview.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.050
Wait. What?

13:04.050 --> 13:05.985
How did you find out
about that?

13:05.985 --> 13:11.024
Hashtag empathy,
hashtag the new me.

13:11.024 --> 13:14.060
Oh. Anyway, I'm just glad
Kevin is getting away from her.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.628
What?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.163
Is he moving cubicles again?

13:17.163 --> 13:19.632
That guy can't keep
his ass in a chair.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.001
Oh, no, he's just really
smart and talented,

13:22.001 --> 13:24.637
and that's why he has
a headhunter all over him.

13:24.637 --> 13:28.641
He has a video interview
at 11:00 so he can get out
of here for good.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.009
Does he?

13:31.678 --> 13:33.079
Showoff.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.684
Yeah, those are
all pretty strong.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.118
The camera just loves
some people.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.054
Not the pictures,
the epiphany.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.088
I want one!

13:42.088 --> 13:44.157
I don't know if you
can want an epiphany.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.159
They have
to just happen.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.127
Oh, my gosh.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.229
I never realized that.

13:50.229 --> 13:53.066
I see everything
so differently now.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.068
Nope. That wasn't one.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.975
What is going on
around here?

14:02.975 --> 14:04.644
Everyone's giving me
weird looks,

14:04.644 --> 14:06.746
and I did a nipple check
already, so I know it's not
that anymore.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.181
I don't know.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.150
Do you think your brother
would give me his chair
when he goes?

14:11.150 --> 14:15.021
I noticed his rear makes
similar indentations to mine.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.123
Oh, now I know why.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.158
I just told everyone what you
told me not to tell anyone

14:19.158 --> 14:20.993
that Kevin told you
was a secret.

14:20.993 --> 14:22.228
Ricky! Why would you do that?

14:22.228 --> 14:25.031
Oh, that's right.
You don't work here.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.133
I'm the totally
untrustworthy one.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.135
Ugh.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.079
Woman:
<i>Is that your office?</i>

14:40.079 --> 14:42.148
This? No, no, no.

14:42.148 --> 14:44.717
I just needed
a quiet place. This is--

14:44.717 --> 14:46.686
The damage is actually
quite minor.

14:46.686 --> 14:47.754
It just looks bad.

14:47.754 --> 14:52.024
<i>Well, we've looked over</i>
<i>your resume and we'd love</i>
<i>to help place you.</i>

14:52.024 --> 14:54.994
Kev! I'm sorry!

14:54.994 --> 14:58.131
-Kev!
-Well, I definitely
want to hear more.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.032
Kev!

15:03.269 --> 15:04.704
Aah!

15:04.704 --> 15:06.139
(debris clatters)

15:07.740 --> 15:09.041
<i>I'm all ears.</i>

15:09.041 --> 15:11.244
<i>-Whoa.</i>
-(body thuds)

15:14.714 --> 15:16.115
Did we fight?

15:16.115 --> 15:17.984
No. No, we've never
been closer.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.152
Wait!

15:19.152 --> 15:21.120
You told Ricky
about my interview.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.188
Yes, yes, old news.

15:22.188 --> 15:24.257
Okay, here's the receptionist.
Be careful 'cause
you're wobbling.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.726
Come on, get off of me.
I can check myself in.

15:26.726 --> 15:29.128
Your epiphany is a joke.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.763
Two, please.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.732
Oh, that's handy.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.167
We got a spinal cord!

15:34.167 --> 15:36.002
No, no, this is from
an earthquake drill.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.136
-He's the one who's hurt.
-Oh.

15:37.136 --> 15:38.704
Yeah, you can take a seat.

15:38.704 --> 15:39.972
He's bleeding!

15:39.972 --> 15:42.241
That's why I pointed
towards the plastic chairs.

15:42.241 --> 15:45.144
No, no, no no!
He's not sitting,
you're getting someone.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.079
I need your insurance card.
Where's your wallet?

15:47.079 --> 15:50.216
I'm not giving you that.
You're like the least reliable
person in the world.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.984
You'd just spend it
all on chips.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.186
Okay, you know what?
You're being such a baby

15:53.186 --> 15:55.121
and so disrespectful
about my epiphany.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.256
I was bragging about you.
Okay? That's why I told Ricky.

15:57.256 --> 15:59.192
Because I think you're
too good for that place.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.326
Whoa, excuse me!

16:00.326 --> 16:02.228
-My son has a fever.
-You can fill this out.

16:02.228 --> 16:05.131
No, no. No one's filling
anything out until my brother
gets medical attention.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.165
We were here first.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.734
Do you really want to step
between a mother and her cub?

16:08.734 --> 16:12.038
Do you really want to see
what I can do with my belt
and your flip-flop?

16:12.038 --> 16:15.308
Because Cara Horvath made
that mistake in 10th grade,
and she didn't graduate on time.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.743
Ha. Whoa.

16:17.743 --> 16:18.978
Feeling a bit queasy.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.081
It's probably just the chili.
Did I have chili?

16:22.081 --> 16:24.250
Get him a doctor now.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.253
What is going on here?

16:27.253 --> 16:29.989
I'm concerned with the stress
of waiting in this line

16:29.989 --> 16:31.290
is gonna come across
in my re-shoots.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.259
Sir, would you like
to move up here?

16:33.259 --> 16:36.195
What are you doing!?
We've been waiting forever.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.030
Although...

16:38.030 --> 16:39.999
You look like you've been
waiting forever forever.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.067
What are you? Like 200?

16:41.067 --> 16:42.969
Show a little kindness,
would you?

16:42.969 --> 16:45.304
Things like earthquakes
are supposed to bring out
the best in people.

16:45.304 --> 16:47.139
Really?

16:47.139 --> 16:49.242
(panting)

16:49.242 --> 16:50.343
Oh, that was terrifying.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.045
Oh, my God.

16:53.045 --> 16:55.081
I've thrown my lot in
with a coward.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.985
I've been cruel
to my baby.

16:58.985 --> 17:03.022
I can't treat him
like that and expect
a lasting relationship.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.157
I have to change my ways.

17:05.157 --> 17:08.027
(angelic chorus sings)

17:08.027 --> 17:09.362
An epiphany!

17:09.362 --> 17:11.297
A real one this time!

17:11.297 --> 17:13.165
Sir, please, go ahead.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.367
Retake that eye test!

17:14.367 --> 17:18.004
I'm going home
to my man.

17:20.239 --> 17:22.241
So, they're gonna keep
you here overnight.

17:22.241 --> 17:24.277
You really came through
for me here.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.378
Thanks.

17:25.378 --> 17:30.316
Yeah, and if you ever want
to give me a chance with
the whole trust thing again...

17:33.152 --> 17:35.087
Okay, here it goes.

17:35.087 --> 17:38.090
If they offer me that job
in Italy, do you think
I should take it?

17:38.090 --> 17:39.091
In Italy?

17:39.091 --> 17:40.259
You can have my apartment.

17:40.259 --> 17:43.062
But I don't want
your apartment without you.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.397
We just started
getting close.

17:44.397 --> 17:48.167
See, I changed
my Facebook status
to in a domestic partnership.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.169
I used to just pretend
that I lived alone,

17:50.169 --> 17:52.171
and when they would ask,
I would say that you were
a drifter

17:52.171 --> 17:54.140
I let in for a glass of water.
But now...

17:54.140 --> 17:57.143
You know, the truth is
I think I just need a change.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.378
This thing with Audrey's
never gonna happen.

17:59.378 --> 18:02.381
The other day, I basically
told her that she had
feelings for me,

18:02.381 --> 18:05.151
and that we were destined
to be together, and...

18:05.151 --> 18:07.186
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

18:07.186 --> 18:09.221
She doesn't even know
that I'm here and not there.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.157
Oh, no. Yeah, she knows.

18:11.157 --> 18:13.059
Everyone does.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.394
I am the god of earthquakes!

18:15.394 --> 18:18.230
Tremble before me!

18:18.230 --> 18:19.332
Oww.

18:20.366 --> 18:21.400
Wow.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.368
Mm-hmm.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.203
So, she knows
that I'm here,

18:24.203 --> 18:26.372
and she hasn't come.

18:26.372 --> 18:29.075
If that doesn't tell me
to go to Italy, I don't
know what does.

18:29.075 --> 18:33.379
Kev, listen. If this thing
with Audrey makes you feel
like you need to leave,

18:33.379 --> 18:35.448
then maybe you should.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.084
I mean,
I don't like it,

18:38.084 --> 18:40.353
but I support you.
It's your decision.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.420
Thanks.

18:41.420 --> 18:44.323
I really hope you remember
how awesome I've been today.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.158
(chuckles)
I will.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.194
But I'm totally lucid now.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.429
Hey, did they put out
the fire at the Hollywood sign?

18:50.429 --> 18:52.198
Patti: Dev?

18:52.198 --> 18:55.201
It's Patti!
She's gonna see
what a failure I am!

18:55.201 --> 18:56.302
Everyone in the shower!

18:58.070 --> 18:59.205
Aah.

18:59.205 --> 19:03.209
Hey, look, Dev just
wanted to prove to you
what kind of man he is.

19:03.209 --> 19:06.212
All right? So, we started
working on other things,

19:06.212 --> 19:09.215
and it just-- Well,

19:09.215 --> 19:12.218
it's kind of like pulling
a thread on a sweater.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.186
Ooh, I have a great tailor
if you need a guy.

19:14.186 --> 19:17.423
I know that last night
I was not a man.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.125
Today I failed you again, so--

19:19.125 --> 19:21.227
No, Devy, stop.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.362
I'm the one that needs
to apologize to you.

19:23.362 --> 19:26.332
I'm sorry I called you
a coward. I don't feel
that way anymore.

19:26.332 --> 19:30.336
And besides,
a couple only needs one alpha.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.205
And we both know
it's me.

19:36.108 --> 19:39.111
Oh, um, look,
I've seen this before, fellas.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.379
We're gonna have to be
the ones to move on out.

19:40.379 --> 19:42.181
So, yeah, go ahead.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.418
I've got you.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.157
We have a massive head injury!
I need a doctor!

19:51.157 --> 19:52.191
No, no ,no.
How's Kevin?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.392
There's no visible
signs of trauma?

19:53.392 --> 19:56.429
She's fine! Don't you guys
get it? These are just stickers!

19:56.429 --> 19:58.197
I came to see Kevin.
Is he okay?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.465
Why was he in the gym?
Did he have to get stitches?

19:59.465 --> 20:01.434
You're asking questions
like you care.

20:01.434 --> 20:04.170
While, Kevin,
on the other hand, does not.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.271
He said he doesn't
want to see you.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.506
He said that?
Kevin said that?

20:07.506 --> 20:10.142
Look, I don't know
what your deal is,

20:10.142 --> 20:12.478
but you are way too far
in his head, and not
in a good way.

20:12.478 --> 20:15.147
What are you talking about?
I haven't done anything wrong?

20:15.147 --> 20:18.150
Oh, right. Except lead him
on in the hugest way?

20:18.150 --> 20:21.320
You know, this all started
with a love letter right?
That he wrote.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.421
Do you, or do you not
have a boyfriend?

20:22.421 --> 20:24.156
You know I have a boyfriend.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.325
Okay. Well, then
go check on him.
'Cause Kevin's fine.

20:26.325 --> 20:29.428
I do care about
your brother. You know?

20:29.428 --> 20:34.200
You can't just have it
every which way you want it.

20:34.200 --> 20:38.237
I'm pretty much
the only person who can do that.

20:38.237 --> 20:42.274
So, we can do this
the easy way, or with
my belt and a flip-flop.

20:42.274 --> 20:43.442
Stay away from my brother.

20:53.319 --> 20:56.288
That was weird.
I thought I heard
Audrey out there.

20:56.288 --> 20:58.290
Did she come
to check on me?

20:58.290 --> 21:00.326
No. No, must have
been dreaming.

21:00.326 --> 21:01.460
Huh.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.531
Ugh!

21:05.531 --> 21:07.533
Oh, I should have warned you.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.301
That is mostly tequila.
