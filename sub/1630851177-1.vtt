04:48.413 --> 04:50.383
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:51.050 --> 04:53.319
- Where were you?
- I was at work.

04:53.386 --> 04:55.187
You said you'd
be home at three.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.890
No, I said four,
three is on my Tuesdays.

04:58.291 --> 05:00.893
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.295
Mm.

05:04.562 --> 05:06.732
Oh, hey, George quit today.

05:07.233 --> 05:10.636
- Who?
- George Amora from Logidex.

05:11.304 --> 05:15.408
- Oh, George.
- Never mind.

05:15.573 --> 05:16.842
No, go on.

05:16.909 --> 05:18.110
You're not...

05:19.477 --> 05:21.814
Well, he quit today.

05:22.315 --> 05:24.516
Said he's gonna go
be a swamp person.

05:24.984 --> 05:27.053
What does that mean?

05:27.720 --> 05:30.089
He wants to hunt alligators.

05:30.156 --> 05:33.225
Eating a $350,000 annual income,

05:33.292 --> 05:35.895
'cause, I mean,
he's high up in Logidex.

05:35.962 --> 05:39.497
Leaving to go hunt alligators, I mean, that's,
I guess it's a whole lifestyle thing,

05:39.564 --> 05:42.500
lifestyle change,
the life of a swamp person.

05:43.069 --> 05:45.404
I guess there's all
sorts of other things

05:45.470 --> 05:49.141
that go along with it,
but still, it just sounds so...

05:49.809 --> 05:52.945
doesn't that seem just dangerous?
Stupid, I mean...

05:53.012 --> 05:55.314
Sam, hon, I'm sorry,
I can't do this right now.

05:55.815 --> 05:57.615
Yeah. Okay.

05:57.683 --> 05:59.551
I'm just really busy.

05:59.617 --> 06:03.389
That's... yeah, I sort of
figured.

06:27.713 --> 06:28.914
<i>Well, you reached me.</i>

06:28.981 --> 06:31.549
<i>I'm Lotus, and yeah,</i>

06:31.616 --> 06:33.119
<i>I guess I'm not around.</i>

06:33.185 --> 06:35.620
<i>So just, yeah,
guess I'll call you back, bye.</i>

06:35.688 --> 06:37.056
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

06:45.597 --> 06:47.466
- Hey, Mom, I need to ask...
- <i>I can't talk right now.</i>

07:03.682 --> 07:04.717
Shit.

07:14.527 --> 07:17.430
- Tony, hey.
- <i>Hey, Jackson.</i>

07:17.496 --> 07:19.432
<i>I got a new batch for you,
it's called Filipino...</i>

07:19.498 --> 07:21.934
Oh, sounds great,
but, um, actually

07:22.001 --> 07:24.870
got a bunch of jungle snow left
from Casey.

07:24.937 --> 07:28.207
<i>Casey? No, no, you don't wanna...
he cuts with laundry detergent.</i>

07:28.274 --> 07:29.875
<i>So if you want
a soapy nose, then...</i>

07:29.942 --> 07:32.311
Yeah, well, I've been
using it for about two weeks

07:32.378 --> 07:33.813
and I haven't found any
soap bubbles up there yet,

07:33.879 --> 07:37.116
still, but your stuff
is better, always is,

07:37.183 --> 07:41.787
unfortunately I'm currently
pretty broke right now,

07:41.854 --> 07:44.190
but if you wanted
to hang out tonight,

07:44.256 --> 07:48.627
I'd be super down to smoke
in the park or something.

07:48.694 --> 07:52.231
<i>Weren't you
invited to the Chapel party?</i>

07:53.265 --> 07:54.733
- What?
- <i>Yeah, the Chapel party,</i>

07:54.800 --> 07:56.569
<i>Lotus says the cops
can't shut it down</i>

07:56.635 --> 07:59.004
<i>if it's technically
a religious gathering, so.</i>

07:59.071 --> 08:03.943
Oh, right, the Chapel party.

08:05.244 --> 08:07.146
Might go, need to check. Um...

08:08.647 --> 08:12.384
Did you maybe want to smoke
before that, like earlier today?

08:12.451 --> 08:18.691
- <i>What, you wanna buy?</i>
- Nah, just, just hang out, really.

08:20.559 --> 08:23.829
<i>Uh, we don't really have that
kind of relationship, Jackson.</i>

08:23.896 --> 08:26.332
- No, I know, you don't have to be such a dick about it.
- <i>I wasn't...</i>

08:26.398 --> 08:28.100
Yeah, well that's how
you're coming off, so.

08:28.167 --> 08:30.269
- <i>Okay, I gotta go, so...</i>
- Okay.

08:31.103 --> 08:32.438
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

09:32.632 --> 09:35.834
Sam, what are we doing for dinner?

09:36.302 --> 09:39.572
Oh, uh, I bought sandwiches.

09:41.207 --> 09:44.109
- Sandwiches?
- Well, yeah.

09:45.044 --> 09:47.913
- Why sandwiches?
- You didn't wanna go out.

09:47.980 --> 09:51.517
Uh, no, I don't have time
to go out, but sandwiches?

09:51.584 --> 09:53.919
Well, yeah 'cause last week
you wanted food and I forgot.

09:53.986 --> 09:56.922
So, today I bought food
before you texted me about it.

09:56.989 --> 09:58.557
That's not dinner food.

10:01.727 --> 10:05.764
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, I guess you're right.

10:15.374 --> 10:18.143
- What?
- I think it's one of those scammers,

10:18.210 --> 10:19.679
like what happened with Marcus.

10:19.745 --> 10:22.481
This girl is saying she's...

10:26.452 --> 10:28.887
From work.

10:29.455 --> 10:31.590
Uh...

10:34.728 --> 10:36.895
No, this is real... this is real.

10:36.962 --> 10:40.232
The, uh... There's a problem
with the computers.

10:40.599 --> 10:42.669
I gotta go get water.

10:43.535 --> 10:46.305
Oh, don't use the fridge water.
The dispenser's broken.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.275
Okay.

11:17.403 --> 11:21.073
Uh, I gotta head out to the...
the computers at work

11:21.140 --> 11:23.609
are acting funny and Jed wants
me to have a look at them.

11:23.677 --> 11:24.877
When are you gonna be back?

11:24.943 --> 11:27.112
I don't know,
probably not too long,

11:27.179 --> 11:29.381
depends on what the problem is.

11:33.753 --> 11:35.354
What are you wearing?

11:38.257 --> 11:40.893
- Boots.
- Boots, are those snake skin?

11:40.959 --> 11:43.763
- Yeah, I wanted to change it up.
- A snake died for those?

11:43.829 --> 11:46.098
That one's a little snug,
I gotta go.

11:46.165 --> 11:47.866
You look ridiculous, Sam.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.968
Thanks, Deborah.

12:28.574 --> 12:29.608
You're Addy?

12:31.043 --> 12:33.780
Yeah, I mostly go by Jackson.

12:35.514 --> 12:36.582
Whoa.

12:37.516 --> 12:38.550
Yeah.

12:45.391 --> 12:47.794
So what is this?

12:47.861 --> 12:50.062
Why are you saying
you're my daughter?

12:51.096 --> 12:52.531
Because I'm your daughter.

12:52.898 --> 12:56.001
Wait, is this a trick for money?

12:56.068 --> 12:57.369
I just wanted to meet you.

12:58.872 --> 13:00.973
Clarice would have
told me if she had a kid.

13:02.374 --> 13:03.676
I don't know,
she said you two had

13:03.743 --> 13:05.645
a pretty big fight
before she left school,

13:05.712 --> 13:07.346
and I'm not defending her
for not contacting you,

13:07.413 --> 13:09.415
just that's what she said
she did.

13:12.117 --> 13:15.421
How long did you know
that I was your...

13:16.054 --> 13:18.725
Oh, I mean, I knew
my whole life.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.895
Yeah, I tracked you down
about six months ago

13:21.960 --> 13:23.529
and it turns out we live
like half an hour away

13:23.595 --> 13:25.063
and I was debating
on and off for awhile

13:25.130 --> 13:26.298
whether or not I
should contact you,

13:26.365 --> 13:27.366
'cause on the one hand
it was like,

13:27.433 --> 13:28.835
"Oh, here's my dad,"

13:28.902 --> 13:31.236
and on the other hand,
I don't know,

13:31.303 --> 13:33.740
I thought it could be weird,
but then, you know,

13:33.807 --> 13:37.943
I had sort of
a strange day today. so...

13:39.344 --> 13:40.780
So, I figured why not?

13:44.082 --> 13:46.418
Did you know that I existed or...

13:47.419 --> 13:48.987
Not until your text.

13:49.054 --> 13:50.956
Right, that's
what my mom said.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.493
What else did she tell you?

13:55.561 --> 13:57.563
You two dated for
a year in college,

13:57.630 --> 13:59.565
and she dropped out before
she knew she was pregnant.

14:00.299 --> 14:01.668
She never told you about it.

14:03.001 --> 14:04.970
It was about three years,

14:05.939 --> 14:10.175
but yeah, that's about right.

14:11.577 --> 14:12.611
How's Clarice doing?

14:13.312 --> 14:17.449
She's good, bit of a wreck,
we don't talk much anymore.

14:18.852 --> 14:21.553
That's... I'm sorry.

14:22.988 --> 14:24.189
It is what it is.

14:28.761 --> 14:30.697
I like your jacket.

14:32.197 --> 14:33.733
Thanks.

14:35.501 --> 14:38.237
Who's that on your T-shirt?

14:38.303 --> 14:42.909
Oh! Um, Lizzie Borden,
probably should've changed.

14:42.976 --> 14:46.111
- Who's Lizzie...
- She murdered her family with an ax in the 1800s.

14:46.178 --> 14:48.413
Oh!

14:48.480 --> 14:51.316
Lizzie Borden took
an ax, gave her mother...

14:51.383 --> 14:54.086
- 40 whacks.
- Yeah, it's a buddy of mine,

14:54.152 --> 14:58.257
he has this stupid T-shirt...
murder tees.

14:58.323 --> 15:01.961
He gave me a bunch for free, so I've just
got them lying around and I found Borden,

15:02.027 --> 15:05.497
obviously, Bundy,
Manson, Dahmer,

15:05.564 --> 15:08.267
and they're supposed to be for teens trying
to be edgy, but they're not selling too well.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.469
You know, I just think they're
not recognizable enough.

15:10.536 --> 15:12.070
You know, he needs to
label them or something.

15:12.137 --> 15:14.172
Like, let's be honest,
if you saw Jeffrey Dahmer's face

15:14.239 --> 15:17.744
- on a T-shirt, like, would you recognize it?
- No, I don't think I would.

15:17.810 --> 15:21.413
See, Jeffrey Dahmer just isn't
an icon in today's popular culture.

15:26.518 --> 15:29.454
I'm sorry, I don't think
I can do this.

15:29.521 --> 15:34.827
- What?
- You seem great and I really wanna get to know you,

15:34.894 --> 15:37.296
but I just don't think
I can do this right now.

15:37.362 --> 15:39.264
I'm not asking to move in
with you or anything, I just...

15:39.331 --> 15:44.303
I know, it's just I didn't
even know you existed,

15:44.369 --> 15:46.471
and now all of a sudden...

15:48.240 --> 15:49.776
I got to go.

15:51.109 --> 15:53.545
What? So should I just not
contact you ever again or?

15:53.612 --> 15:57.382
No, no. I'll contact you
when I'm...

15:57.449 --> 16:00.252
- Seriously?
- Just please, I...

16:01.054 --> 16:02.621
Okay, bye.

16:02.689 --> 16:03.790
I just...

16:04.857 --> 16:06.224
Please, I... I'm...

17:12.125 --> 17:14.794
- Hey.
- Hey. What, uh...?

17:14.861 --> 17:16.294
Oh, how'd it go?

17:16.361 --> 17:18.463
- What?
- Did you get dinner?

17:18.530 --> 17:19.965
Huh?

17:20.032 --> 17:22.935
Oh, they had a pro...

17:23.002 --> 17:27.372
there was a problem
with the... the m-meat.

17:27.439 --> 17:28.875
Sam.

17:34.814 --> 17:40.419
<i>Danny, I'm so sorry,
I'm sorry, Danny.</i>

17:40.485 --> 17:42.088
<i>What do you want?</i>

17:42.155 --> 17:45.825
<i>Tell me what you want,
please, please, tell me.</i>

17:45.892 --> 17:48.326
<i>Get back her right now, Danny.</i>

17:48.393 --> 17:51.329
<i>Danny, Danny!</i>

19:17.984 --> 19:21.687
Oh, fuck.

19:30.595 --> 19:31.664
Fuck.

20:26.152 --> 20:29.655
- You didn't answer your phone. Sam, we gotta go.
- Jackson?

20:29.722 --> 20:31.389
- Yeah, yeah. Listen...
- What...

20:31.456 --> 20:34.093
The man, the mouth man
who ate the girl...

20:34.160 --> 20:35.995
- What?
- He showed up at my apartment 20 minutes ago...

20:36.062 --> 20:38.430
Let me finish! He showed up at
my apartment 20 minutes ago

20:38.496 --> 20:40.066
with his mouth all big
and chompy.

20:40.132 --> 20:41.466
I figure if he's coming for me,
he's coming for you too.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.135
- We gotta go!
- But what is he?

20:43.202 --> 20:44.971
No clue, we're gonna go
find out.

20:45.037 --> 20:47.306
I'm sorry, you want me to get...
no, no, no,

20:47.372 --> 20:49.175
I'm not going with you
in the middle of the... no, no!

20:49.242 --> 20:50.609
You're gonna get eaten!

20:50.676 --> 20:51.644
Well, I...

20:51.711 --> 20:54.947
Sam, what's going on?

20:55.014 --> 20:57.950
- Who's this?
- This is...

20:58.017 --> 21:00.485
- Oh, my God, Sam.
- Did you not tell her?

21:00.552 --> 21:02.587
Deborah,
this it's not, it's not...

21:02.655 --> 21:04.056
Oh, it's not, is it?

21:04.690 --> 21:06.759
Excuse me, are you
fucking my husband?

21:08.728 --> 21:15.268
You didn't tell her, okay. Um, no,
I'm his daughter, and Sam, we gotta go.

21:15.334 --> 21:17.203
- I'm not going.
- What?

21:17.270 --> 21:19.839
He had me in college, I just met him.
We have to go!

21:19.906 --> 21:22.440
- Sam is this real?
- Well, it's not as simple...

21:22.507 --> 21:24.609
- And you didn't tell me?
- Well, I just found out.

21:24.677 --> 21:26.045
- When?
- Today.

21:26.112 --> 21:28.014
- When today?
- At the...

21:28.080 --> 21:29.514
Wait, is that what
you were texting about?

21:29.581 --> 21:31.449
Oh, for fuck's sake,
will you two stop arguing

21:31.516 --> 21:32.652
so we can leave
and not get eaten?!

21:32.718 --> 21:34.153
You said it was
about computers!

21:34.220 --> 21:36.656
- I don't want... no.
- What are you talking about?

21:36.722 --> 21:38.791
Big mouth man ate a girl,
we gotta go.

21:38.858 --> 21:39.892
- No!
- What?

21:39.959 --> 21:41.861
- That's it!
- Oh, my God!

21:41.928 --> 21:45.798
Sam, we're leaving now.

21:45.865 --> 21:47.166
- No!
- I'm calling the police.

21:47.233 --> 21:49.068
No! I will throw this knife
at your face,

21:49.135 --> 21:51.103
and I'm a goddamn
circus freak at knife throwing.

21:52.104 --> 21:53.139
I was in the army.

21:56.776 --> 21:58.010
- Get your shoes on.
- No!

21:58.077 --> 21:59.611
Get your shoes on.

21:59.679 --> 22:03.249
Okay, okay, but I'm not going.

22:03.316 --> 22:09.322
- Mm-hmm.
- Jackson, for crying out loud, you gotta stop.

22:09.388 --> 22:10.423
Who is that?

22:14.660 --> 22:15.761
Who is that?

22:18.998 --> 22:23.102
Sam, he was after me and you,
not your wife.

22:23.636 --> 22:26.839
You wanna keep her safe?
You come with me.

22:32.945 --> 22:35.815
- Deborah, I'm... I'm...
- Sam, wait.

22:40.353 --> 22:41.787
It's cold.

23:01.207 --> 23:03.876
So, you, like, a cowboy?

23:05.211 --> 23:07.579
- What?
- Boots?

23:07.646 --> 23:11.083
Oh, no, they're just boots,
where are we going?

23:11.150 --> 23:13.551
They're cool boots.
Uh, it's a house party.

23:13.618 --> 23:15.587
Well, actually,
it's a Chapel party.

23:15.654 --> 23:16.789
I don't really know
what that means, you know,

23:16.856 --> 23:19.425
Chapel-themed,
Jews-themed, maybe.

23:19.492 --> 23:21.961
- Are you a man of God, Sam?
- Why are we going there?

23:22.028 --> 23:24.463
We're gonna go pick up
my buddy, Lotus.

23:24.529 --> 23:27.666
Lotus is... he's the guy.

23:27.733 --> 23:29.601
You know, the guy that you want
for shit like this,

23:29.668 --> 23:33.571
you know, ghosts, and vortexes,
and magik,

23:33.639 --> 23:35.174
you know, with a K where it's
supposed to be real

23:35.241 --> 23:39.611
and he's got all the, uh,
magical... books.

23:40.246 --> 23:43.115
He's got all sorts
of books and stuff,

23:43.182 --> 23:45.184
you know, that can keep us safe.

23:46.218 --> 23:48.120
Great father-daughter
bonding experience.

23:49.321 --> 23:51.457
Hey, look, I really do
want to get to know you,

23:51.524 --> 23:54.460
but you pulled a knife
on my wife.

23:54.927 --> 23:56.796
That kind of sounds
like a Dr. Seuss rhyme.

23:59.532 --> 24:02.968
Seriously, I'm sorry about that.

24:03.035 --> 24:05.805
It was just... I had to
get you out of there,

24:05.871 --> 24:07.640
and normal people don't
mess with crazy people.

24:07.706 --> 24:09.275
So, you know,
if I act, like, ugh, crazy,

24:09.341 --> 24:11.609
it's just so that normal people
won't mess with me,

24:11.677 --> 24:13.312
because, you know,
I used to walk around LA

24:13.379 --> 24:15.314
in the middle of the night,
just, like, muttering to myself.

24:15.381 --> 24:17.349
Like, "It's not you, it's not you,
it's her, it's her, it's her,"

24:17.416 --> 24:18.984
and nobody messed with me.

24:19.051 --> 24:20.486
Like, I don't even know
how to throw knives.

24:20.553 --> 24:22.121
I've never thrown a knife.

24:24.056 --> 24:26.425
But yeah, yeah, I can see
how that might've been...

24:27.126 --> 24:30.429
Ooh, don't answer it.

24:31.363 --> 24:33.466
Can you just text her and tell
her everything's all right?

24:33.532 --> 24:35.634
Everything's not all right.
There's a man with...

24:35.701 --> 24:38.637
I know, but just tell her
that we're both safe and good,

24:38.704 --> 24:40.539
and I don't want her
calling the cops.

24:40.605 --> 24:41.841
I'm already dead.

24:42.875 --> 24:45.444
Anyway, it's not her decision.

24:47.012 --> 24:49.181
- What?
- Whether I go with you or not.

24:49.248 --> 24:50.816
Not her decision to make.

24:52.617 --> 24:53.652
Well, um...

25:00.559 --> 25:02.895
So what's your deal, Sam?

25:02.962 --> 25:04.396
What's my deal?

25:04.463 --> 25:07.500
Yeah, you know,
what are you about?

25:07.566 --> 25:09.702
Can you maybe
not smoke in here?

25:12.104 --> 25:13.339
Come on.

25:16.675 --> 25:18.144
Seriously?

25:20.713 --> 25:22.882
I work in a marketing firm
called Logidex.

25:22.948 --> 25:24.350
Yeah, is that
all you're about?

25:24.850 --> 25:27.853
No, my wife,
I care about my wife.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.255
But you didn't
tell her about me?

25:29.321 --> 25:32.124
Well, you don't just
spring that on somebody.

25:32.191 --> 25:35.895
I mean, you told her you were my
daughter and a man ate a girl.

25:35.961 --> 25:37.530
Are you in a healthy
relationship?

25:38.430 --> 25:39.899
- Yes.
- Really?

25:40.366 --> 25:42.768
- Yes.
- Oh, really?

25:42.835 --> 25:45.804
Well, any more
interview questions?

25:46.205 --> 25:47.239
No.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.808
I'm sure there'll be more
as the night goes on

25:49.875 --> 25:52.378
and I think we are in for
quite an interesting night.

26:20.539 --> 26:23.509
Sam, please answer.

26:24.343 --> 26:26.078
I need you to talk to me.

26:27.012 --> 26:28.380
I need to know where you are.

26:28.881 --> 26:33.786
You know what? I'm sorry, no,
it doesn't matter where you are.

26:34.486 --> 26:36.322
I just need to know
that you're safe.

26:36.989 --> 26:42.528
Uh...
Please, please call me back.

26:43.162 --> 26:45.097
I just wanna talk.

26:45.665 --> 26:48.400
I wanna talk about all of this,
whatever's going on.

26:49.034 --> 26:51.036
I wanna be there for you.

26:52.938 --> 26:54.373
I'm not angry.

26:56.175 --> 26:57.610
I love you.

26:57.677 --> 26:59.144
<i>You've reached
the maximum time</i>

26:59.211 --> 27:00.879
<i>permitted for recording
your message.</i>

27:00.946 --> 27:03.315
<i>If you are satisfied with
your message, press one.</i>

27:03.382 --> 27:05.217
<i>To listen to your message,
press two.</i>

27:30.276 --> 27:32.712
You ever think about if/then
of this whole conundrum?

27:32.778 --> 27:34.780
You know, like if it's true
that there's a magic man

27:34.847 --> 27:37.216
that eats people,
like whatever wackiness numbers are true,

27:37.283 --> 27:39.151
kind of offends science as we know
it, you know?

27:43.055 --> 27:45.858
- Sam?
- I'll just wait in the car.

27:45.924 --> 27:50.697
Um... No, there's a man with
a mouth, with a big mouth after us.

27:50.764 --> 27:52.498
We need a name for it,
you cool with Chompy?

27:52.564 --> 27:57.036
Yeah, yeah,
that's... yeah, okay.

27:58.804 --> 28:01.507
So these are like
friends of yours, yeah?

28:01.840 --> 28:04.644
Well, uh, we're gonna find out.

28:05.645 --> 28:09.214
I think it's... yeah, this way.

29:19.853 --> 29:21.553
- Lotus.
- Jackson.

29:21.821 --> 29:23.622
This is certainly a surprise.

29:23.690 --> 29:27.059
The old Jacky, Jack,
Jack, Jackson in town.

29:27.493 --> 29:30.697
Hmm. And who's the...?

29:30.764 --> 29:34.032
Yeah, I'll get to that.
Lotus, we have to talk.

29:34.099 --> 29:36.535
Oh. Well, why don't you tell me what
you've been up to first, Jackson?

29:36.602 --> 29:39.037
I mean, it's been, well,
it's certainly been awhile.

29:39.104 --> 29:41.641
- Give me a life update.
- Later, Lotus, we gotta talk.

29:41.708 --> 29:44.844
Mm, let's drink.
This is Genevieve.

29:44.910 --> 29:47.312
Now her and our spirit animals
are like this.

29:47.379 --> 29:48.815
It's also her house.

29:48.882 --> 29:51.116
I'm sorry about the trash bag.
My shirt burned.

29:51.183 --> 29:52.551
Yeah, yeah, lovely to meet you,
Guinevere.

29:52.618 --> 29:54.286
Lotus, like now, okay?

29:54.353 --> 29:56.155
Nice to...

29:59.291 --> 30:01.927
Hey, man, I like your boots.

30:05.531 --> 30:08.902
You left Genevieve back there.
She's there, she's alone.

30:08.967 --> 30:11.003
This Chapel party sucks,
it's a mess.

30:11.069 --> 30:12.672
Yeah, okay, okay, that's fine.

30:12.739 --> 30:15.307
Listen, we need your help
with some like paranormal shit.

30:15.374 --> 30:18.076
Oh, fuck, yeah,
that shit is my jam.

30:18.143 --> 30:20.579
Okay, now you need to tell me,
is there a spook involved?

30:20.647 --> 30:22.181
Yeah, so there was this girl,
right?

30:22.247 --> 30:23.917
This little girl, she must be
like nine or something

30:23.982 --> 30:25.652
- and she was standing there...
- Yeah, tell me this.

30:25.718 --> 30:27.186
I imagine it was probably
something with her,

30:27.252 --> 30:29.823
like a shadowy type of...
it's a Rixella, all right?

30:29.889 --> 30:31.490
It's an interdimensional,
kind of parasite

30:31.557 --> 30:33.258
attached to people,
you know what I'm talking about?

30:34.126 --> 30:37.463
No? Okay, look guys, there's been
a manload, a report, a manload.

30:38.297 --> 30:40.599
I thought it'd be like my new word.
It's a manload.

30:41.166 --> 30:44.069
No, Lotus, it wasn't the girl.
There was a man who opened his mouth.

30:44.136 --> 30:45.705
Okay, okay, okay,
keep talking about all that,

30:45.772 --> 30:47.439
but Jackson, do you want
a little bit of the good stuff?

30:48.106 --> 30:50.609
- No! H or coke?
- H!

30:51.410 --> 30:54.046
No, this... why the fuck...
this is important, okay?

30:54.112 --> 30:55.915
Okay, calm your crumpus
there, chump.

30:55.981 --> 30:57.616
I don't do heroin.

30:57.983 --> 31:00.185
Can we please just get back
to the man who ate a girl?

31:00.419 --> 31:04.289
Oh, he ate her, did he,
mouth into...?

31:04.356 --> 31:06.291
Right, so Sam and I were
just sitting on the park bench

31:06.358 --> 31:08.527
and then we saw them across the
way, and then he opened his mouth,

31:08.594 --> 31:11.563
like super wide, like way wide, and then...
and then he just swallows her,

31:11.631 --> 31:14.099
like he goes up and then
he goes up and...

31:14.166 --> 31:16.903
and like her feet are sticking
out, and then she's just gone.

31:26.111 --> 31:28.514
- Lotus?
- That girl.

31:38.190 --> 31:40.660
Ah!

31:41.360 --> 31:43.595
- What the fuck, kid?
- There was a pill, okay?

31:43.663 --> 31:45.063
There was a pill he put in there
and he wanted to give it to you.

31:45.130 --> 31:47.266
And you! You were trying to...

31:50.302 --> 31:53.505
- Fuck!
- Jesus Christ.

31:56.241 --> 31:58.745
You! Son of a bitch!

31:58.811 --> 32:01.246
He's a fucking rapist!

32:05.150 --> 32:07.654
- What the fuck was that?
- Look there was a pill, okay,

32:07.720 --> 32:09.588
he put a pill in her drink
when she was gone.

32:10.522 --> 32:11.724
- Oh.
- Yeah.

32:12.825 --> 32:14.526
- What, so you drank it?
- What?

32:14.593 --> 32:17.529
- You drank the pill.
- Yeah, he was gonna give it to her.

32:17.596 --> 32:19.331
You couldn't just take
the drink or you could

32:19.398 --> 32:22.100
have spilled it out or just tell her?

32:22.669 --> 32:25.270
- Who the fuck are you?
- Get in.

32:29.508 --> 32:30.743
Seat belts.

32:41.353 --> 32:43.388
Lotus, we're going
to your place, okay?

32:43.455 --> 32:45.959
You can barricade us in with some
sort of magic circle or something.

32:46.025 --> 32:49.361
Hold on, I'm texting 911
about that guy.

32:49.428 --> 32:51.196
- Is this really necessary?
- What?

32:51.263 --> 32:53.298
What, the guy, yeah, it's 911,
fuck, yeah, it's necessary.

32:53.365 --> 32:55.802
No, not that,
the whole magic circle.

32:55.868 --> 32:57.870
Yeah, Lotus, can you
make a magic circle?

33:01.641 --> 33:05.377
You're asking me about
magic circles, man.

33:05.444 --> 33:08.014
Something like 90% of the stuff

33:08.081 --> 33:09.882
that people run around here
talking about is magic.

33:09.949 --> 33:13.318
It's not magic,
it's just bullshit.

33:13.385 --> 33:15.354
That's just people walking
around with their own beliefs

33:15.420 --> 33:19.157
their own religion,
their own politi-ti-ti-tics,

33:19.224 --> 33:22.394
- and it just gets...
- Lotus, we don't need to talk about this.

33:22.461 --> 33:26.565
No, no, no, wait...
mashes together, so what do you have?

33:26.633 --> 33:30.402
You got this little, tiny,
tiny, little, little piece

33:30.469 --> 33:32.839
of something that's real,
that's truthful.

33:32.905 --> 33:35.908
And you gotta find it,
and sometimes that means listening

33:35.975 --> 33:39.746
and communicating to people,
and that's what life's about.

33:39.812 --> 33:42.447
That's what we're
here to do, Jackson,

33:42.514 --> 33:44.282
do you know what I mean,
do you know what I mean?

33:47.452 --> 33:48.553
Yeah.

33:49.656 --> 33:51.390
Lotus, can you
make a magic circle?

33:52.125 --> 33:53.325
Yeah, why?

33:54.159 --> 33:55.762
What's a magic circle?

33:55.828 --> 33:57.730
Jackie, you running
around with this guy?

33:57.797 --> 33:59.297
- It'll protect us.
- Really?

33:59.364 --> 34:02.501
I got books,
I got tons of books.

34:02.669 --> 34:04.637
Mouths and...

34:04.704 --> 34:06.471
Hey, you all right, buddy?

34:06.538 --> 34:10.643
Yeah, yeah. Mm.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

34:10.710 --> 34:13.646
Just a bit dizzy,
that's all, but it's okay.

34:17.949 --> 34:22.420
Oh, oh, yo, Lotus,
did you just puke?

34:24.123 --> 34:28.427
Mm-mm, done nothing
but a sporadic tooth,

34:29.795 --> 34:31.396
but I'm gonna find it,
I'm gonna find it,

34:31.463 --> 34:33.598
- 'cause the tooth fairy...
- Jackson, look.

34:33.666 --> 34:35.635
- No, I've got...
- Look.

34:35.702 --> 34:37.369
Okay, what?

34:38.871 --> 34:40.237
That's the girl.

34:42.373 --> 34:43.876
No.

34:45.243 --> 34:46.779
- Hey, Lotus.
- Huh, what?

34:46.846 --> 34:48.181
You see that little girl
up there?

34:49.246 --> 34:53.186
You're kind of a dick, Jackson.

34:54.252 --> 34:56.656
- You're like a Jack-dick.
- Jesus, Lotus.

34:56.723 --> 34:58.758
No, that's why, that's why

34:58.825 --> 34:59.959
I don't hang out
with you anymore.

35:00.026 --> 35:01.426
That's why we
don't talk anymore.

35:01.493 --> 35:03.328
I'm gonna go talk to her.

35:03.395 --> 35:06.298
No, listen, Sam,
she's just standing there

35:06.364 --> 35:07.432
on the side of the street
in the middle of the night.

35:07.499 --> 35:10.136
That's not, that's not normal.

35:10.203 --> 35:11.637
You're gonna have to come
with me.

35:12.337 --> 35:16.709
Yeah, I'll come with you,
I'll come buddy, come on.

35:16.776 --> 35:19.611
That's okay.

35:33.425 --> 35:37.196
Uh, excuse me, um, no, no,
no, no, it's okay.

35:37.262 --> 35:39.498
We're not gonna hurt you,
it's okay, it's okay.

35:39.564 --> 35:42.501
Uh... What's your name?

35:45.805 --> 35:48.141
- Birch.
- Birch.

35:48.741 --> 35:50.777
- It's Birch.
- What you doing out here, Birch?

35:52.377 --> 35:53.646
I need help.

35:56.048 --> 35:59.786
My... my parents are gone.

36:00.987 --> 36:03.321
- I need help.
- What happened to your parents?

36:03.388 --> 36:06.192
Yeah, I'll help you,
but what are you doing

36:06.259 --> 36:08.127
on the side of the street
at 3:15 in the morning?

36:09.796 --> 36:12.231
- My mom was gonna get me.
- I think...

36:12.297 --> 36:14.200
Your mom was gonna pick you up
in the middle of the night?

36:14.267 --> 36:17.369
My mom.

36:17.435 --> 36:18.403
- Jackson.
- What?

36:18.470 --> 36:19.504
You're being kind of...

36:19.571 --> 36:21.107
she's crying, you gotta stop.

36:21.174 --> 36:23.308
You were the one who was
all suspicious of her be...

36:24.644 --> 36:27.780
Okay, I'm sorry,
but you have to admit

36:27.847 --> 36:30.149
that this is pretty f...
this is pretty weird.

36:31.449 --> 36:35.554
We saw a little girl who looked
just like you in the park

36:35.620 --> 36:37.056
when a man picked her up
and ate her.

36:37.123 --> 36:40.358
- Jackson!
- So how do you explain that?

36:42.195 --> 36:44.429
I don't know.

36:44.496 --> 36:47.365
- Birch, Birch, it's okay.
- Yeah, yeah, it's okay, Birch.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.635
Where were you
at four o'clock yesterday?

36:49.702 --> 36:54.173
- I was in a lot of places.
- Such as?

36:54.539 --> 36:55.908
I don't know,

36:55.975 --> 36:58.744
a movie,
I was at a movie.

36:58.811 --> 36:59.779
- What movie?
- Jackson.

36:59.846 --> 37:01.914
- "Bananaman."
- What?

37:01.981 --> 37:06.418
Here, tell me what
"Bananaman" is about, hmm?

37:08.688 --> 37:11.590
It's about a man,
he's a banana man

37:11.657 --> 37:14.727
and he lives in the jungle
with Strawberry Gerry,

37:14.794 --> 37:16.762
and they have to go
to the puddles to get milk,

37:16.829 --> 37:18.331
but Vegetable Soup
doesn't want them to

37:18.396 --> 37:19.899
because it's her milk,
and there was a mouse

37:19.966 --> 37:21.600
that eats them
and then they're okay,

37:21.667 --> 37:23.302
and they get it out of the mouse
and then there's a tornado...

37:23.368 --> 37:26.471
- Birch, it's okay, it's okay.
- Yeah, it's okay, it's okay.

37:26.538 --> 37:29.374
- What happened next?
- Jackson, can I talk to you?

37:31.644 --> 37:34.947
- Um, stop.
- I'm interrogating her.

37:35.014 --> 37:37.016
Well, God, if her parents
are missing,

37:37.083 --> 37:39.151
all we gotta do is call the
police and then we can go.

37:39.218 --> 37:42.655
Sam, Sam, she's involved. She's
involved with Chompy one way or another,

37:42.722 --> 37:45.658
- and the police are not going to be able to help her.
- I don't...

37:51.731 --> 37:54.834
- Go, go!
- Oh, Birch, here, come with me.

37:54.901 --> 37:56.669
Come with me,
come with me now, now, now

37:56.736 --> 37:58.871
Come on, come on, come on,
get in the car, get in the car.

37:58.938 --> 38:00.139
Get in!

38:02.875 --> 38:05.044
- Get in the car, get in the car, get in the car!
- I know.

38:05.111 --> 38:08.480
She doesn't need a seatbelt.
No, it doesn't matter, just get in the car!

38:11.449 --> 38:15.721
Go, go, go, go, go!

38:18.190 --> 38:20.458
Birch, do you have
any clue who that was?

38:20.960 --> 38:23.362
- I don't... I don't know.
- No clue?

38:23.428 --> 38:24.462
No.

38:41.213 --> 38:44.482
Sam, do you have
any other kids?

38:47.887 --> 38:48.955
No.

38:52.124 --> 38:53.426
Only child.

38:55.795 --> 38:57.997
<i>Do you
love boats like I love boats?</i>

38:58.064 --> 39:00.433
<i>Then you know you can't
boat without insurance.</i>

39:12.311 --> 39:14.447
What's the deal, get off me!

39:20.019 --> 39:23.122
Okay, okay, I'm gonna
take Lotus in, but just... Sam...

39:23.189 --> 39:25.725
- Whoa, whoa, Jackson.
- Give me one second, one second, okay?

39:37.203 --> 39:39.005
Oh, Sam, this...

39:42.008 --> 39:45.144
- What is this?
- Uh, benzoyl-methyl-ecgonine.

39:47.612 --> 39:49.215
It's cocaine.

39:50.483 --> 39:52.385
That's not nice!

39:52.451 --> 39:55.121
I will not have you
putting us all at risk just to...

39:55.187 --> 39:57.990
Oh, boy.

39:58.057 --> 40:01.327
Nice boots, cowboy.

40:02.661 --> 40:05.197
- Nope, nope, nope, just...
- Okay.

40:07.666 --> 40:11.270
I always wondered
what a roofie was like.

40:11.337 --> 40:14.440
Birch, you can come, too.
Why don't you want to come in?

40:15.573 --> 40:20.946
- He's not right.
- No, the truth in the 1950s.

40:21.013 --> 40:25.751
- Your breath smells bad.
- The government, they used chemical weapons.

40:25.818 --> 40:27.987
Oh, he's on... he's just
kind of sick.

40:28.054 --> 40:30.122
You don't have to worry about him.
He's not going to hurt you.

40:30.189 --> 40:32.291
- Can we wait out here?
- No, no, no, we gotta go.

40:33.492 --> 40:36.262
- No.
- Birch, it's not safe out here.

40:38.030 --> 40:40.199
Birch, you know the man
who was chasing you?

40:40.833 --> 40:42.535
If we stay out here,
he could come back.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.003
It was a violation
of the Geneva...

40:44.070 --> 40:45.938
- Are you guys coming?!
- Yeah.

40:47.173 --> 40:49.275
- Okay, Birch, we gotta go.
- No, no.

40:49.341 --> 40:52.645
- Come on. It's okay, you're all right.
- Stop, Please! Stop, stop!

40:52.711 --> 40:57.149
- Stop! Stop! Okay, okay, okay.
- Come on.

40:57.216 --> 40:58.551
Go.

41:02.755 --> 41:03.789
I'm okay.

41:13.866 --> 41:16.969
You all right, buddy?

41:17.036 --> 41:19.672
Okay, where's the book
with the mouth man?

41:19.738 --> 41:21.507
You're a mouth man.

41:25.444 --> 41:31.484
- Hey, Birch, what time is it?
- What?

41:32.617 --> 41:35.054
- What time is it?
- It's, uh, four...

41:35.121 --> 41:37.089
Nope, it's rag time.

41:42.628 --> 41:45.431
Mm-mm. No.

41:47.566 --> 41:50.035
It's rag time
'cause of the...

41:54.106 --> 41:57.610
Lotus, can you make a magic circle?

41:57.676 --> 42:00.379
Mm-hmm.

42:00.446 --> 42:04.016
Okay, okay, okay, come on,
buddy, it's time for bed.

42:04.083 --> 42:07.453
- You go to bed.
- No, no, no, come on.

42:08.320 --> 42:11.657
Hey, hey, hey, careful
with the merch index.

42:19.098 --> 42:24.236
Birch, everything all right?

42:28.941 --> 42:29.975
Birch?

42:33.479 --> 42:36.282
You know, Jackson,

42:36.348 --> 42:41.887
you still owe me 30 bucks
for the exorcism.

42:41.954 --> 42:43.122
That wasn't
an exorcism, Lotus.

42:43.189 --> 42:44.590
Where's the
book with the mouth man?

42:51.397 --> 42:55.968
You know what, Jackson,
I don't like you very much.

42:56.035 --> 42:58.704
That's great, thanks, Lotus.

42:59.905 --> 43:02.676
Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean it it like that,

43:02.741 --> 43:04.310
Jackson, I didn't mean
to hurt you like that.

43:04.376 --> 43:08.648
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it
like that, I'm sorry.

43:08.747 --> 43:10.349
I'm an addict, Jackson.

43:10.416 --> 43:12.618
Okay, okay, it's okay.
It's all right.

43:13.719 --> 43:16.021
- I'm sorry, Jackson, I'm sorry.
- Come on.

43:16.088 --> 43:21.327
I know. Yeah, just lay down.

43:21.393 --> 43:23.262
Let's play the breathing game,
okay?

43:23.329 --> 43:29.068
In, two, hold, two, out, two.

43:29.201 --> 43:35.207
In, two, hold, two, out, two.

43:35.675 --> 43:41.780
In, two, hold, two, out, two.

43:58.264 --> 43:59.431
Come on.

44:00.032 --> 44:01.267
Sleep on your side.

44:29.795 --> 44:30.829
Sam?

44:50.449 --> 44:51.651
Sam, Sam?

44:53.653 --> 44:54.820
Sam?

44:56.822 --> 44:57.890
Sam?

45:00.926 --> 45:02.127
Come on.

45:02.995 --> 45:07.499
God, oh, my God, oh, my God, Sam,
Sam, Sam, wake up, wake up, please.

45:08.033 --> 45:13.038
Oh, my God, fucking son of a bitch.

45:13.105 --> 45:15.040
Oh, my God. It's okay, okay.

45:16.008 --> 45:20.279
How, how...
What just, uh...

45:20.346 --> 45:23.315
Water,
I'll get you some water.

45:24.718 --> 45:26.919
Birch was some sorta,
I don't know,

45:26.985 --> 45:28.887
I didn't read the whole thing
of Lotus's book,

45:28.954 --> 45:30.622
but she was on top of you and
it was like you were being eaten

45:30.690 --> 45:33.392
or something and she ran off
and...

45:35.027 --> 45:37.329
How long, how long
was I unconscious?

45:38.564 --> 45:43.902
Seconds? Longer?
But you were just unconscious.

45:43.969 --> 45:47.005
You were... I don't want to say
you were... you were dead,

45:47.072 --> 45:49.608
but it kind of seemed that way,
so...

45:50.309 --> 45:53.612
And there's some... Lotus,
he said, he said something

45:53.680 --> 45:59.284
about "Recalla"... Rixella is
an interdimensional parasite.

45:59.351 --> 46:01.821
Invisible in our reality,
it attaches to a host

46:01.887 --> 46:03.790
it finds vulnerable,
yada, yada, yada.

46:03.857 --> 46:05.792
This does not seem like it.

46:05.859 --> 46:09.595
- Oh, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

46:10.362 --> 46:11.765
Are you all right?

46:13.432 --> 46:14.566
Hold on.

46:30.282 --> 46:32.351
It's just too fucking weird.

46:32.418 --> 46:34.386
It's... oh, God.

46:34.854 --> 46:37.923
F-f-foot, foot.

46:39.893 --> 46:41.059
Uh...

46:42.528 --> 46:47.032
I don't think there's anything
in here about... Sam, I...

46:47.099 --> 46:49.968
- That does not happen.
- I know, I know.

46:50.035 --> 46:56.975
No, no, you don't.
I... it's, it's, it's baby foot!

46:57.744 --> 47:00.680
- Yeah.
- I have a baby foot!

47:00.747 --> 47:03.650
Yeah, we can, um...

47:13.492 --> 47:15.929
- I wanna go home.
- Sam, if you go home,

47:15.994 --> 47:18.798
your foot stays this way
and you get eaten.

47:21.133 --> 47:22.669
Were you really in the army?

47:23.402 --> 47:26.972
Yeah, yeah, for like two weeks.

47:27.573 --> 47:30.844
They, uh, kicked me out.

47:31.443 --> 47:33.780
- Why'd you join?
- It seemed exciting,

47:33.847 --> 47:36.181
save the country, get to die.

47:38.918 --> 47:40.185
I texted Deborah.

47:42.254 --> 47:43.388
She's on her way.

47:44.590 --> 47:45.591
What?

47:46.458 --> 47:50.864
- I just...
- God, Sam, no, no, why would you...

47:51.530 --> 47:52.464
What's she gonna do?

47:52.531 --> 47:53.565
I can't do this.

47:53.633 --> 47:55.635
What, your foot or...

47:58.972 --> 48:00.138
This?

48:01.139 --> 48:03.910
- I just, I just... What?
- Seriously.

48:03.977 --> 48:06.411
So I should just
not contact you again.

48:06.813 --> 48:08.614
No, no, I want you to.

48:08.681 --> 48:10.115
Okay, you were
being more of a dad

48:10.182 --> 48:12.886
- to Birch than to me, okay?
- She was ten!

48:12.952 --> 48:16.388
Oh, great, so I, I should've come
to you when I was 10. Got it.

48:16.789 --> 48:19.692
Jackson, Jackson, come back.

48:21.861 --> 48:24.229
- What?
- You got lucky.

48:24.831 --> 48:26.733
- Chompy?
- Mm-hmm.

48:27.499 --> 48:28.600
Okay.

48:30.168 --> 48:31.603
Okay, I'm gonna go talk to him.

48:32.538 --> 48:34.273
What?

48:34.339 --> 48:36.275
I... You can't walk.

48:36.341 --> 48:39.444
Jackson, I'm sorry.

48:43.382 --> 48:45.952
Bad idea, bad idea,
bad idea why is this a bad idea?!

48:52.190 --> 48:56.896
Hey, the girl, Birch,
the girl you ate.

48:59.197 --> 49:01.801
Um, she attacked us.

49:01.868 --> 49:03.870
She attacked me.

49:03.937 --> 49:05.504
I got away, I mean,
she got away.

49:05.571 --> 49:10.142
She ran off, um,
I think it was that w...

49:10.208 --> 49:12.712
- Was it that way, Jackson?
- I didn't see.

49:12.779 --> 49:14.847
You're after her, right?
You're after the girl?

49:14.914 --> 49:16.883
Or you're after us?

49:18.785 --> 49:23.288
I mean, she turned my
foot, it's a small foot.

49:23.355 --> 49:28.393
I mean, maybe we can talk
about this, talk this through,

49:28.460 --> 49:31.363
you know, work together,
share what we know.

49:31.864 --> 49:34.566
I mean, can you talk?

49:36.134 --> 49:37.737
Can you understand me?

49:39.739 --> 49:43.342
He's gotta understand you 'cause he
stopped when you mentioned Birch.

49:43.977 --> 49:48.948
Can you help us
or do you need our help?

50:07.000 --> 50:12.839
You want us...
are we gonna be okay?

50:18.143 --> 50:19.611
Okay.

50:24.449 --> 50:27.152
Okay, well.

50:28.021 --> 50:30.890
Jackson, you don't... oh.

50:37.030 --> 50:38.230
No.

50:39.364 --> 50:42.534
No, no, no, no, no, no.

50:44.003 --> 50:45.337
Shit.

50:53.046 --> 50:54.513
Oh.

50:55.547 --> 50:58.051
- W-w-what...
- Jackson, Sam,

50:58.117 --> 51:01.721
me Talon,
you are safe now.

51:01.788 --> 51:04.791
I cannot speak in physical form.

51:04.857 --> 51:08.761
So, I brought you here
to explain my actions.

51:08.828 --> 51:12.264
Welcome to my mouth.

51:14.332 --> 51:17.469
If you had revealed
my existence

51:17.536 --> 51:19.639
after the incident in the park,

51:19.706 --> 51:22.574
my work may
have been compromised.

51:22.642 --> 51:27.446
I am in pursuit of a Rixella,
the shadow parasite,

51:27.512 --> 51:30.348
attaching to those
who allow it in

51:30.415 --> 51:35.253
and are vulnerable enough to
be affected by its presence.

51:35.320 --> 51:38.290
In this case, the young girl,
Birch,

51:38.356 --> 51:41.994
it is set on assimilating
every human being

51:42.061 --> 51:44.831
into an exact
replication of her,

51:44.897 --> 51:47.166
which brings us
to your foot, Sam,

51:47.232 --> 51:52.705
an unfinished assimilation,
but I will swallow them.

51:52.772 --> 51:58.111
I will heal them and I
will destroy the Rixella.

51:58.177 --> 52:02.715
However, you must not alert
anyone of my presence.

52:03.950 --> 52:04.984
Yeah.

52:06.585 --> 52:08.154
Can you fix my foot?

52:09.055 --> 52:13.760
When the shadow dies,
your foot will recover,

52:14.227 --> 52:18.798
until then, it seems
your adventure is complete.

52:18.865 --> 52:24.402
I will save your species
but need no thanks.

52:24.971 --> 52:29.909
Sleep well tonight
knowing I am out there.

52:40.653 --> 52:42.255
Oh, my God.

52:43.288 --> 52:45.624
- Oh, my God.
- So Chompy, you just...

52:45.925 --> 52:49.796
And we just... Oh, boy.
Okay.

52:50.395 --> 52:52.698
Yeah.

52:56.002 --> 53:01.274
So, we just let you be

53:01.339 --> 53:06.145
and you let us live and you save
the day?

53:10.850 --> 53:15.221
All right, all right, yes, okay.

53:18.691 --> 53:21.861
Great, holy shit.

53:32.972 --> 53:34.240
Great.

53:52.058 --> 53:53.226
What?

53:57.730 --> 54:00.733
- Oh!
- Deborah?

54:01.701 --> 54:04.502
Oh!

54:06.639 --> 54:09.108
What is he?

54:09.175 --> 54:13.112
Chompy, hey, Chompy.

54:15.580 --> 54:17.350
He was gonna save us.

54:18.550 --> 54:22.188
- H-he was gonna...
- And you killed him.

54:24.389 --> 54:27.425
I got to... we need
to call the police.

54:27.492 --> 54:30.329
- No, no!
- Deborah, Deborah, it's not like that.

54:30.395 --> 54:32.064
- We need to move him.
- What?

54:32.331 --> 54:35.467
We need to move him,
so Sam, grab his arms,

54:35.533 --> 54:39.171
and Deborah,
just go park the car by the sidewalk.

54:39.238 --> 54:41.674
- What?
- Sam, be useful, God damn it, Sam...

54:41.741 --> 54:45.144
...and Deborah just leave, okay, leave!

54:47.512 --> 54:50.216
Sam, just...

54:50.283 --> 54:51.817
Baby foot!

55:01.193 --> 55:04.163
No, out, out, out, you get out!

55:04.230 --> 55:07.900
- Jackson.
- This... this is on you, buddy.

55:21.280 --> 55:25.217
- Where are we going?
- We are going... we are going away.

55:25.284 --> 55:27.753
We are driving...
we are driving away.

55:30.588 --> 55:31.958
Okay.

55:33.292 --> 55:35.328
Hey, Deb, where we going, hmm?

55:37.330 --> 55:40.066
We're going to Peter's Pancakes.
We're going to Peter's Pancakes

55:40.132 --> 55:45.004
because I... I have not eaten
in 12 hours and I am hungry.

55:46.105 --> 55:47.273
Okay?

55:48.674 --> 55:49.809
Okay.

56:02.321 --> 56:04.622
Hi, welcome to Peter's
Pancakes, my name's Kakei.

56:04.690 --> 56:06.292
Can I get you guys started
with something to drink?

56:06.359 --> 56:07.525
I'll just have water.

56:08.493 --> 56:11.731
- How's your coffee?
- Oh, I don't drink coffee, I'm Mormon.

56:12.365 --> 56:15.968
Right, well, I'll have a coffee
and a cup

56:16.035 --> 56:17.636
of half orange juice,
half pineapple juice.

56:17.703 --> 56:18.871
Yum.

56:19.672 --> 56:21.573
And for you, miss?

56:23.508 --> 56:24.542
She's fine.

56:26.278 --> 56:29.315
I'll have a toast.

56:29.382 --> 56:30.983
Oh, are we ordering food now?

56:31.884 --> 56:35.553
- Sure!
- Okay. I'll have a large stack

56:35.620 --> 56:38.590
of chocolate chunk-o,
double stack pancakes. Sam?

56:40.525 --> 56:42.061
I'm good with just a water.

56:42.128 --> 56:43.561
Sam, you've been up
all fucking night.

56:43.629 --> 56:45.097
You didn't eat shit.

56:45.164 --> 56:46.499
You know what happens
when you don't eat,

56:46.564 --> 56:48.134
your body shuts down,
I don't need you

56:48.200 --> 56:50.002
fucking shutting down on me,
so just...

56:58.310 --> 57:01.347
- I'll have bacon.
- Just a side of bacon?

57:01.414 --> 57:03.015
- Yeah.
- Not very healthy.

57:03.548 --> 57:06.018
Well, you're eating choc...
choco-chink.

57:06.085 --> 57:09.554
Chocolate chunk, Sam,
what you just said is a racial slur.

57:12.191 --> 57:14.026
I think that's all, thank you.

57:25.838 --> 57:29.175
Why are you so hurt?

57:29.241 --> 57:32.445
Hurt, I'm not hurt,
I'm not hurt.

57:32.511 --> 57:34.547
I'm fucking worried because we're
all gonna be little girls now.

57:34.612 --> 57:36.015
No, no, I don't...
I don't mean that.

57:36.082 --> 57:39.251
I meant before,
before any of that.

57:40.086 --> 57:43.122
Level with me, Jackson,
what's going on with you?

57:43.189 --> 57:46.959
Sam, you're my father,
you're not my dad.

57:47.026 --> 57:48.727
So stop trying to be,
you had that chance

57:48.794 --> 57:50.563
at the park
and you fucking blew it.

57:53.899 --> 57:57.602
And why did we leave Chompy at Lotus's?
That was a stupid thing to do.

57:58.370 --> 57:59.972
Fuck, I'm gonna text him.

58:04.043 --> 58:05.311
Who did I kill?

58:05.945 --> 58:07.980
Little girls are trying
to assimilate humanity

58:08.047 --> 58:09.748
and you killed the one thing
that could have stopped them.

58:09.815 --> 58:11.317
- Jackson, you have to stop.
- Stop what?

58:12.718 --> 58:14.687
Sam, you can't do this.

58:14.753 --> 58:16.522
Deb, I know it doesn't
make sense.

58:16.589 --> 58:18.090
Is this really your daughter?

58:21.293 --> 58:24.730
Deborah, it's not...
the table's wet. Gross.

58:24.797 --> 58:27.733
Yes, I am,
but we need a plan, okay?

58:27.800 --> 58:30.870
Because if we don't have a plan, we just sit
here eating pancakes and then we all die.

58:30.936 --> 58:33.572
Deb, look under the table.

58:33.639 --> 58:35.941
- Why?
- Just look under the table.

58:40.846 --> 58:43.716
- What did you do to him?
- Now, Deb, Deb, she didn't do anything.

58:43.782 --> 58:45.117
It was a little girl.

58:47.620 --> 58:49.121
I can't do this.

58:54.627 --> 58:56.630
We could get a divorce.

59:00.966 --> 59:03.637
- That's not what I meant.
- What if we set a trap?

59:03.702 --> 59:06.739
Like, lure 'em into one place
and then and kill 'em.

59:06.805 --> 59:09.775
- What if we talked to them?
- You want to talk to it?

59:09.842 --> 59:12.745
- Sam, why?
- Yeah, I mean, 'cause we talked to the mouth man

59:12.811 --> 59:14.880
and, you know what, that worked.

59:14.947 --> 59:17.950
Yeah, until he died;
I'm not pointing fingers.

59:18.017 --> 59:20.753
Well, no, it did, we thought
he was trying to kill us.

59:20.819 --> 59:23.622
- We talked to him and it worked out okay.
- So we killed him instead.

59:23.689 --> 59:29.061
That's not relevant.
Jackson, I'm sorry.

59:31.697 --> 59:34.133
I'm really sorry,
I know I didn't handle

59:34.200 --> 59:36.302
our relationship
the way I should have,

59:36.368 --> 59:40.072
but you're right,
we have to do something.

59:41.006 --> 59:42.741
So we're gonna to talk to Birch.

59:46.680 --> 59:48.180
There's one close by.

59:51.483 --> 59:53.185
There's a lot of 'em.

01:00:11.937 --> 01:00:16.075
Uh. Jackson,
you're pouring syrup on the table.

01:00:17.042 --> 01:00:18.277
Am I?

01:00:18.777 --> 01:00:20.312
Yeah, I'm gonna
keep pouring the syrup

01:00:20.379 --> 01:00:22.649
on the table until you come up
with a rational plan.

01:00:22.716 --> 01:00:27.353
Just syrup city, syrup swamp,
syrup sea,

01:00:27.419 --> 01:00:32.825
you know, S-E-A, sea, hmm,
no plan, we're all fucked.

01:00:32.891 --> 01:00:36.730
- Girls win, that's all, folks.
- Oh, I'm sorry, you can't smoke in here, it's...

01:00:40.566 --> 01:00:42.736
Why would you do that?

01:00:48.874 --> 01:00:51.176
I have to clean this up now.

01:00:56.315 --> 01:00:57.416
You wanna?

01:00:58.718 --> 01:00:59.818
Yeah.

01:01:00.819 --> 01:01:05.324
Excuse me, sorry.

01:01:10.896 --> 01:01:12.031
Uh...

01:01:13.733 --> 01:01:15.367
It's all I have, so.

01:01:19.271 --> 01:01:23.777
I'm gonna talk to the girls.

01:01:52.171 --> 01:01:53.405
Excuse me.

01:01:54.139 --> 01:01:55.574
I need help.

01:01:56.842 --> 01:01:58.877
What do you need help with?

01:02:08.487 --> 01:02:11.890
Go straight, she's nearby.

01:02:12.624 --> 01:02:14.159
How do you know?

01:02:14.226 --> 01:02:17.262
Oh, uh, I think my foot
can feel it, I don't know.

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:20.767
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:02:22.635 --> 01:02:28.675
I know, but I have to ask,
why did you spill the syrup?

01:02:29.709 --> 01:02:30.909
I just did.

01:02:31.644 --> 01:02:34.446
- You just did?
- Yeah.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:41.855
- Well, that's not good enough.
- Sam, I'm sorry, okay, but I am not a happy person.

01:02:42.756 --> 01:02:44.791
I like to tell myself it's
because I live in California

01:02:44.858 --> 01:02:46.659
and I hate California,

01:02:46.726 --> 01:02:49.763
and I like to tell myself
it's because my mom sucked

01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:51.831
and I didn't know my dad,
and I really,

01:02:51.897 --> 01:02:56.168
really like to tell myself it's
because I'm a heroin addict,

01:02:57.871 --> 01:03:04.276
and if I move to some naturey
countryside, if I quit heroin cold turkey,

01:03:04.343 --> 01:03:07.546
if I won the California
Lottery Mega-Millions,

01:03:07.613 --> 01:03:08.981
I would be happy...

01:03:11.049 --> 01:03:17.589
for a month
or two or three, max.

01:03:19.726 --> 01:03:21.828
And then I would just be
right back where I started.

01:03:26.965 --> 01:03:28.434
Do you still use heroin?

01:03:30.202 --> 01:03:35.007
No. I don't,
you caught me with coke,

01:03:35.073 --> 01:03:37.476
which is much healthier,
it's a lower LD50,

01:03:37.543 --> 01:03:39.378
which means less chance of
ODing and lower addiction rates,

01:03:39.445 --> 01:03:40.847
I mean, it's a bit
more expensive, but...

01:03:40.914 --> 01:03:42.214
Is it difficult?

01:03:42.782 --> 01:03:45.852
- What?
- Addiction?

01:03:47.821 --> 01:03:48.855
You have no idea.

01:03:54.727 --> 01:03:56.562
- You know, I think you're wrong.
- Yeah?

01:03:56.628 --> 01:04:00.332
Not about addiction,
about your mindset.

01:04:06.639 --> 01:04:09.041
Have you ever thought of
joining the Peace Corps?

01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:15.380
No, I'll check that out.

01:04:19.451 --> 01:04:22.421

but I like this song.</i>

01:04:22.488 --> 01:04:23.890

No, no, no.

01:05:19.979 --> 01:05:21.313
Help!

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.582
- Oh!
- Help!

Okay. No. Legs.
Okay.

01:05:37.897 --> 01:05:39.331
[Birch No!

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.294
Go!

01:06:21.808 --> 01:06:24.476
If you act crazy,
normal people don't mess with you.

01:06:24.543 --> 01:06:26.746
- Uh... Okay.
- We should probably go, though.

01:06:27.145 --> 01:06:28.246
Oh.

01:06:33.285 --> 01:06:36.488
Mm.

01:07:40.853 --> 01:07:42.655
How are you
holding up, Deborah?

01:07:47.492 --> 01:07:48.861
You want a divorce?

01:07:50.129 --> 01:07:54.299
Uh... I... I...

01:07:54.366 --> 01:08:00.006
- Can we talk about this later?
- I just need to know what to do with the rest of my life.

01:08:00.472 --> 01:08:03.676
Look, if I said I wanted a
divorce, and I'm not saying I do,

01:08:03.743 --> 01:08:08.280
it would be because I thought that
we both would be happier apart.

01:08:09.347 --> 01:08:14.787
I just... I love you, Deb.

01:08:17.221 --> 01:08:18.256
No, you don't.

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:24.063
Have you been wanting to
for awhile?

01:08:32.571 --> 01:08:35.573
I've thought about it.

01:08:40.078 --> 01:08:45.752
I just feel like you, we never,
you never communicate with me.

01:08:46.551 --> 01:08:49.721
- I don't communicate?
- I mean, well, not, no, no, not, not like that.

01:08:49.788 --> 01:08:53.524
I just, I mean,
when's the last time

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:55.828
we had a real conversation?

01:08:58.263 --> 01:09:01.399
When's the last time
you asked me how my day was?

01:09:03.202 --> 01:09:06.470
I try to talk to you.

01:09:06.537 --> 01:09:10.810
Sam, you talk to me
about nothing.

01:09:11.877 --> 01:09:15.247
We've been communicating
on small talk.

01:09:15.313 --> 01:09:18.917
I think since before
we were married.

01:09:22.054 --> 01:09:25.124
But we used to be friends.

01:09:30.428 --> 01:09:33.099
Okay, okay.

01:09:33.166 --> 01:09:35.067
This is all really good,
but we're here.

01:09:35.134 --> 01:09:38.938
So I'm going to need help with the...

01:09:44.143 --> 01:09:48.881
- Tape now. Now!
- I'm looking, Jackson, where's the tape?

01:09:48.948 --> 01:09:52.051
- I don't know.
- Ah. Oh, baby foot!

01:09:52.118 --> 01:09:53.451
Here, here.

01:09:54.754 --> 01:09:57.223
It's okay, it's okay.

01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:58.858
Got it, I got it, I got it.

01:10:00.425 --> 01:10:03.029
Yes, Lotus replied,
he's found Chompy.

01:10:03.095 --> 01:10:06.032
- Oh, God.
- Come here now.

01:10:07.365 --> 01:10:09.135
- Okay, Birch, let's talk.
- Do we have tie her up?

01:10:09.202 --> 01:10:12.205
Yes. Why do you want to
assimilate everyone, hmm?

01:10:12.271 --> 01:10:14.640
Look Birch, we're not trying to hurt you,
we're just trying to figure this out.

01:10:14.707 --> 01:10:18.878
Birch, Birch, listen to me. We just need your
help is all, so what's going on in your head?

01:10:18.945 --> 01:10:21.214
Do you want everyone
to be like you?

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.716
Do you need to? Is this something
you need to do to survive...

01:10:41.868 --> 01:10:43.435
Oh, no!

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.676
- Is the whole place locked?
- No, no, that's good, though, that's good.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.982
Oh, fucking ass.

01:10:56.048 --> 01:10:57.917
Bathroom window,
kitchen window.

01:10:57.984 --> 01:10:59.685
Jackson, what window's open?

01:10:59.752 --> 01:11:01.620
Oh, my God, bathroom
has no windows.

01:11:01.687 --> 01:11:04.090
I have never felt this
distressed in my entire life.

01:11:04.156 --> 01:11:07.760
Idea: so if you get this one to
insanity, they share a mind,

01:11:07.827 --> 01:11:11.364
so they would all go insane,
we could torture it,

01:11:11.429 --> 01:11:13.598
which I don't wanna do
'cause sounds really icky,

01:11:13.666 --> 01:11:15.467
and regardless of the fact
that they are monsters,

01:11:15.533 --> 01:11:17.637
they do look like little girls,
and it totally might not work.

01:11:17.703 --> 01:11:19.138
It might make them all
super angry, and also

01:11:19.205 --> 01:11:21.539
Sam has a baby foot and I don't
really like that,

01:11:21.606 --> 01:11:22.842
we should not do that.

01:11:22.909 --> 01:11:24.509
They're not angry,
they're scared.

01:11:24.576 --> 01:11:25.912
Is your foot telling you that?

01:11:26.913 --> 01:11:28.114
Are they dangerous?

01:11:30.349 --> 01:11:32.218
The windows, we need
to check the windows.

01:11:33.152 --> 01:11:38.858
Windows, okay, oh, great, oh, great.
That's not fucking terrifying.

01:11:38.925 --> 01:11:41.060
- Mattress.
- Mattress. The mattress.

01:11:41.127 --> 01:11:44.063
We can make a barricade.

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:47.633
- Stop.
- It's helping with adrenaline, you need to scream with me.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:59.078
- Hey, hey, Lotus, you here?
- There's a lot of girls out here, lot of girls.

01:11:59.145 --> 01:12:01.080
- There's no way I'm coming in.
- What's going on?

01:12:01.147 --> 01:12:03.149
What, how I am supposed
to know what these are,

01:12:03.215 --> 01:12:04.884
who these are,
I don't know what these are.

01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:07.019
Shit, can you make
a magic circle?

01:12:07.086 --> 01:12:09.587
No, I cannot draw
a magic circle.

01:12:09.655 --> 01:12:11.523
I told you, I'm surrounded,
okay?

01:12:11.589 --> 01:12:13.259
That is for non-corporations
only, and, oh, by the way,

01:12:13.326 --> 01:12:15.361
I've got the dead mouth-angel
in my trunk.

01:12:15.428 --> 01:12:17.263
By the way, how did you guys
kill a mouth-angel?

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:18.764
F... Can we do anything with it?

01:12:18.831 --> 01:12:20.933
Can we feed them to the body?

01:12:21.499 --> 01:12:24.904
No, maybe.

01:12:24.971 --> 01:12:27.707
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Where's Deborah?

01:12:28.473 --> 01:12:31.344
- I don't know.
- No, that's it, put the girls in the corpse's mouth.

01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:33.446
- <i>The portal might still be open.</i>
- Okay, okay, fine,

01:12:33.511 --> 01:12:35.014
bring Chompy in, I will,
I will.

01:12:35.081 --> 01:12:37.350
No, no, there's no way
that I'm coming in there.

01:12:37.416 --> 01:12:40.052
You're gonna come out here,
no way.

01:12:40.119 --> 01:12:42.455
- She's looking right at me.
- Jackson, where's Deborah?

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.424
Fuck, Sam, I gotta go.

01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:47.927
- What?
- Jackson, Jackson? Jack...

01:12:47.994 --> 01:12:51.964
Deb, Deborah, Deb.

01:13:03.809 --> 01:13:04.877
What?

01:13:09.148 --> 01:13:11.050
Deb, Deb.

01:13:15.821 --> 01:13:17.423
I'm sorry.

01:13:34.407 --> 01:13:36.409
Lotus, pop the trunk.

01:13:36.475 --> 01:13:37.575
Okay.

01:13:43.416 --> 01:13:45.885
Jackson!

01:13:56.594 --> 01:13:57.797
Hey.

01:13:58.697 --> 01:14:00.099
Hey.

01:14:05.071 --> 01:14:06.872
How you doing?

01:14:08.007 --> 01:14:11.143
Not good.

01:14:17.416 --> 01:14:20.519
Your, uh... your hand is, uh...

01:14:20.585 --> 01:14:26.591
Oh. Oh. Oh, God.

01:14:30.696 --> 01:14:33.598
Why'd I buy these stupid boots?

01:14:35.568 --> 01:14:37.103
Snake died for these.

01:14:47.246 --> 01:14:49.582
I don't think we should have
gotten married.

01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:53.252
Do you wanna end it?

01:14:54.954 --> 01:14:59.925
If we live, yeah.

01:15:06.732 --> 01:15:08.667
I'm glad you found Jackson.

01:15:12.805 --> 01:15:14.173
Me too.

01:15:44.803 --> 01:15:45.971
Birch.

01:15:53.179 --> 01:15:54.813
Are you gonna hurt me?

01:15:57.651 --> 01:16:00.719
Okay, okay, hey, hey, hey.

01:16:02.821 --> 01:16:05.157
Just talk to me, okay?

01:16:06.358 --> 01:16:07.426
What's...?

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.729
I don't want to hurt anyone.

01:16:11.665 --> 01:16:16.035
Okay, okay, yeah,
you're good, you're good.

01:16:17.369 --> 01:16:20.606
But, uh... What's that?

01:16:20.674 --> 01:16:23.042
You need to go now.

01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:28.847
Okay, I'll go, but just first,
just what is it, hmm?

01:16:28.914 --> 01:16:30.583
It's making me do it.

01:16:31.317 --> 01:16:32.451
I don't want to.

01:16:33.687 --> 01:16:36.288
I made Susan me
and I made my parents me

01:16:36.355 --> 01:16:40.559
and Ms. Hiyoshito me,
and I made a lot of people me.

01:16:43.362 --> 01:16:45.497
- What is it?
- I can't tell you.

01:16:45.564 --> 01:16:49.034
You need to go. Go. Go!

01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:51.904
Please.

01:16:52.672 --> 01:16:53.973
Okay, okay.

01:16:57.109 --> 01:16:59.612
- Birch, do you wanna get it off you?
- I can't.

01:17:00.512 --> 01:17:02.214
Why not?

01:17:02.281 --> 01:17:05.217
I can't, it's part of me now.

01:17:06.785 --> 01:17:07.920
It's part of you?

01:17:12.258 --> 01:17:13.626
It's okay, it's okay.

01:17:16.895 --> 01:17:19.131
No.

01:17:20.032 --> 01:17:22.801
- I can deal with this.
- What, what?

01:17:22.868 --> 01:17:25.871
Birch, just let it go,
just give it to me.

01:17:25.938 --> 01:17:30.309
- But... No, no, no.
- Shh, shh, shh. Listen to me, okay?

01:17:30.376 --> 01:17:32.544
You don't have to live
like this anymore.

01:17:32.611 --> 01:17:35.581
You don't have to live
like this anymore, okay?

01:17:35.649 --> 01:17:39.653
I can take it, okay? Okay? I'll take it.

01:17:40.919 --> 01:17:42.689
- Thank you.
- Go.

01:17:50.596 --> 01:17:52.197
Okay.

01:17:54.099 --> 01:17:57.671
You're not taking over.

01:17:57.737 --> 01:18:00.506
You're not taking over!

01:18:33.605 --> 01:18:37.343
You are not assimilating
anyone else.

01:18:39.211 --> 01:18:40.714
Sorry, buddy.

01:19:02.034 --> 01:19:06.205
Help, help, please, help!

01:19:14.012 --> 01:19:15.414
Get off my daughter!

01:19:16.048 --> 01:19:18.384
Get off!

01:19:20.219 --> 01:19:21.788
Come on.

01:19:39.004 --> 01:19:40.406
It's okay.

01:19:49.948 --> 01:19:52.719
We gotta get out of here, come on.

01:19:54.086 --> 01:19:59.291
Come on, jump, get out.

01:20:00.727 --> 01:20:04.363
Go again. Again.

01:20:10.402 --> 01:20:14.440
It's okay, baby,
it's okay, it's okay.

01:20:30.088 --> 01:20:32.257
Jackson, Jackson.

01:20:32.324 --> 01:20:34.393
Oh, my God.

01:20:36.796 --> 01:20:38.631
- Grab hold.
- Oh, my God.

01:20:39.398 --> 01:20:41.500
Whoa! Jeez.

01:20:42.234 --> 01:20:43.670
Hold on.

01:20:44.671 --> 01:20:48.440
Oh! Someone get help, help,
somebody help, help, come here.

01:21:02.488 --> 01:21:04.423
Thank you.

01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:07.192
Yeah, yeah.

01:21:10.329 --> 01:21:11.530
Yeah.

01:21:52.404 --> 01:21:54.239
Mom, Dad.

01:22:05.885 --> 01:22:09.054
So, you two doing okay?

01:22:10.055 --> 01:22:11.189
Uh...

01:22:12.057 --> 01:22:13.026
Uh...

01:22:14.226 --> 01:22:17.296
I think we're... I think we're
getting a divorce.

01:22:17.362 --> 01:22:18.497
Yeah.

01:22:18.564 --> 01:22:20.265
Probably for the best.

01:22:22.035 --> 01:22:23.235
Right.

01:22:24.671 --> 01:22:26.773
Yeah.

01:22:30.710 --> 01:22:34.546
Sorry about all this.

01:22:37.215 --> 01:22:38.483
Not your fault

01:22:40.152 --> 01:22:43.756
Yeah, but I didn't have
to be such a dick about it.

01:22:47.392 --> 01:22:49.996
I'm... I'm sorry, too.

01:22:55.267 --> 01:22:56.435
It's all right.

01:23:00.773 --> 01:23:02.507
I think I need help.

01:23:43.082 --> 01:23:46.618
So who are you?

01:23:50.923 --> 01:23:54.226
This is my dad, Sam.

01:23:54.927 --> 01:23:58.898
Oh. Okay, I don't think you
ever mentioned that part.

01:23:59.632 --> 01:24:00.800
Hi.

01:24:08.141 --> 01:24:11.744
So I guess that must mean
that you're her...

01:24:11.811 --> 01:24:14.080
No, no, Deborah, hi.

01:24:15.782 --> 01:24:16.916
Okay.

01:24:21.553 --> 01:24:23.321
I'm really glad I reached out
to you.

01:24:24.222 --> 01:24:28.527
Yeah, I'm really glad too.

01:24:36.135 --> 01:24:40.907
You guys want to
get some breakfast?

01:24:47.345 --> 01:24:50.582
Yeah, and then sleep.

01:24:52.185 --> 01:24:53.418
I could eat an egg.

01:24:55.088 --> 01:24:56.189
Me too.

01:24:57.657 --> 01:25:00.793
- Let's do it, Deb.
- I'll drive.

01:25:06.199 --> 01:25:07.432
Okay.

01:25:09.534 --> 01:25:11.236
Yeah.
