I saw him. I heard later
he was missing...

taken an overdose.

it was a suicide.

-Shut up.

34:31.160 --> 34:33.400
-Has anything happened?
-No.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.920
You know you have to report it
if you sleep with him.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.520
Nothing's happened.

34:42.120 --> 34:46.240
-Do you think Rob will
mind us drinking his wine?
-That's what housemates are for.

34:49.440 --> 34:53.000
I suppose Charlie is quite cute,
in a geeky sort of way.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.320
You'd definitely have to take
charge in the bedroom though.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.120
I bet he hasn't got a clue
where anything is.

34:57.240 --> 35:00.120
We are not having
this conversation.

-There were two of them

Through Rachel's contact
I've found your asset's
true identity.

37:39.800 --> 37:43.120
Her name's Laura Daniels.
That's her brother, Liam.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.640
He was picked up in the security
sweeps after the attack.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.720
We sent him to the camp.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.320
That's him.

37:51.320 --> 37:54.840
-Why was he picked up?
-He was laundering money
for a terrorist cell.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.360
I looked at his file,
there was phone tap evidence.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.240
He was a viable suspect.

37:59.360 --> 38:02.160
So, we know who she is
and why she's doing it but
we still need to find her.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.120
Any ideas?

The guys who grabbed me
last night knew I was
looking for fake ID.

There's only one person
I talked to about that.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.280
You told someone I was looking
for ID, who was it?

38:19.400 --> 38:23.120
I don't know what
you're talking about, mate.
Who the fuck are you?

38:23.240 --> 38:27.760
You can't do that. This is out
of order, I'm gonna report you.

38:27.880 --> 38:29.840
-Where're you getting fake IDs?
-I want a lawyer.

Billy, you tell us where you're
getting the IDs or we stick you
in Camp Windsmere.

clean-up operation in London.

'It's not like they need
their IDs any more, is it?'

38:52.120 --> 38:55.840
D'you know this girl? You've
been supplying her with ID?

38:55.960 --> 38:58.520
-I need the names you gave her.
-I don't know the names.

I keep records, is it?

-When was the last time
you saw her?
-A few days ago.

39:08.800 --> 39:12.320
She asked me to put her
in touch with someone
who knows explosives.

I told her, forget it,
way too heavy for me.

I was looking for ID?

work here, David-something.

I don't know his surname,

39:22.200 --> 39:24.720

if anyone was asking
about the girl.

Call it in.

at Wood Road Relocation Centre.
