00:27.861 --> 00:29.445
[Narrator] Since the dawn of man,

00:29.530 --> 00:33.574
the vampires have walked
among us, killing, feeding.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.743
The only one
with the strength or skill

00:35.828 --> 00:38.871
to stop their heinous evil
is the Slayer,

00:38.956 --> 00:42.583
she who bears the birthmark,
the mark of the coven.

00:42.793 --> 00:45.962
Trained by the Watcher,
one Slayer dies

00:46.046 --> 00:48.131
and the next is chosen.

00:49.425 --> 00:51.134
And I shall be his sword.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.761
Let Satan tremble.

00:53.846 --> 00:56.723
The Slayer is born.

01:00.102 --> 01:04.230
Keep, keep it comin'

01:04.313 --> 01:08.025
Dance till you can't dance

01:08.110 --> 01:09.986
Keep it comin'
Keep it comin'

01:10.070 --> 01:12.405
Keep it comin', y'all
Keep it comin'

01:12.489 --> 01:15.992
Dance till you can't
Dance till you can't
dance no more

01:16.076 --> 01:18.202
Keep it comin'
Keep it comin'

01:18.287 --> 01:20.580
Keep it comin', y'all

01:20.664 --> 01:24.542
Dance till you
just can't dance

01:24.626 --> 01:26.586
[Man Rapping]
Feel the fury
of the one-of-a-kind

01:26.670 --> 01:28.963
Any rhyme I say,
A-OK, that was a dope rhyme

01:29.047 --> 01:33.092
Change the pace of the flow
Yo, be smooth is the rhythm

01:33.177 --> 01:35.428
This is what you get
This is what
I'm givin' uptown

01:35.512 --> 01:38.723
Get down to the funkyjam
To slam the funky jam

01:38.807 --> 01:41.017
Yo, rhymin' offbeat
is Q Unique

01:41.101 --> 01:43.519
Dancin' up your girlfriend
'cause I dip her sweet soul

01:43.604 --> 01:45.271
Shake, shake, shake
your groove thing

01:45.355 --> 01:47.440
As I pick up the mike
and make the crowd swing

01:47.524 --> 01:50.109
Well, what do you know?
Kids want total control

01:50.194 --> 01:53.279
Hey, you, leggo my eggo
[Chorus]
Keep it comin'

01:53.363 --> 01:55.782
Keep it comin', y'all
Keep it comin'

01:55.866 --> 01:58.075
Dance till you can't
Dance till you can't
dance no more

01:58.160 --> 01:59.619
Go, go, go

01:59.703 --> 02:01.621
Keep it comin'
Keep it comin'

02:01.705 --> 02:03.956
Keep it comin', y'all
Keep it comin'

02:04.041 --> 02:06.626
Dance till you

02:06.710 --> 02:09.836
Go, go, go
Keep it comin'

02:09.922 --> 02:12.340
Keep it comin', y'all

02:12.424 --> 02:14.717
Dance till you can't
Dance till you can't
dance no more

02:14.802 --> 02:18.221
Go, go, go
Keep it comin'

02:18.305 --> 02:20.515
Keep it comin', y'all
Keep it comin'

02:20.599 --> 02:24.477
Dance till you
just can't dance
Go, go, go

02:24.561 --> 02:26.479
[Man]
And when the bass-drummer
makes the big slam

02:26.563 --> 02:28.981
In case you didn't see me
here I am, trash it

02:29.066 --> 02:30.274
Industry nothin'
like a jackal

02:30.359 --> 02:32.235
The name I have a tackle,
a snap, a crackle, a pop

02:32.319 --> 02:34.070
'Cause the not
you know it's mine

02:34.154 --> 02:35.988
Rate, rate, dover-weight
Come back

02:36.073 --> 02:39.325
Another date, nuff said
Here I go, here I go
Here I go

02:39.409 --> 02:41.494
Grab me up
I'm gonna blow
I'm gonna blow

02:41.578 --> 02:43.329
Okay, people,
they're psyching you out.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.498
Let's not be so defensive
out there, okay?

02:45.582 --> 02:47.583
What do we say on the court?
Repeat after me.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.920
"I am a person.
I have a right to the ball."

02:51.004 --> 02:52.839
Good. All right,
here's our key play.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.258
We're gonna...
Are we the X's or the O's?

02:55.342 --> 02:58.094
We're the O's.
Oh. Oh, right. Okay.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.263
Did you catch
what I was sayin'?
Me neither

03:00.347 --> 03:02.306
I just wanted to catch
a quick breather

03:03.392 --> 03:05.351
Keep it comin'
Keep it comin'

03:05.435 --> 03:07.979
Keep it comin', y'all
Keep it comin'

03:08.063 --> 03:10.523
Dance till you can't
Dance till you can't
dance no more

03:10.607 --> 03:11.858
Go, go, go

03:11.942 --> 03:13.818
Keep it comin'
Keep it comin'

03:13.902 --> 03:16.070

Keep it comin'

03:16.154 --> 03:20.074
Dance till you
just can't dance
Go, go, go

03:20.158 --> 03:22.076
Keep it comin'
Keep it comin'

03:22.160 --> 03:24.495
Keep it comin', y'all
Keep it comin'

03:24.580 --> 03:26.831
Dance till you can't
Dance till you can't
dance no more

03:26.915 --> 03:28.249
Go, go, go

03:28.333 --> 03:30.334
Keep it comin'
Keep it comin'

03:30.419 --> 03:32.837
Keep it comin', y'all
Keep it comin'

03:32.921 --> 03:36.674
Dance till you
just can't dance

03:36.758 --> 03:40.261
[Cheering]

03:48.812 --> 03:52.273
Mr. Howard is so heinous.
[Scoffs]

03:52.357 --> 03:54.233
He's always giving me
a hard time.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.736
I get a C-plus on the test,
and he tells me,

03:56.820 --> 03:58.321
"You have
no sense of history."

03:58.488 --> 04:01.866
I have no sense of history?
He wears a brown tie.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.661
You got a C+?
I can't believe
I cheated off of you.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.831
[Sighs]
Excuse me for not knowing
about El Salvador.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.208
Like I'm ever
going to Spain anyway.

04:12.502 --> 04:15.212
Oh, wow.
Look at that jacket.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.676
Oh, this is so lush.

04:21.345 --> 04:23.095
Wouldn't you guys
just love me in this?

04:23.180 --> 04:25.973
Guys, what's
the sitch?
I'm bored.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.475
What do you think?

04:27.559 --> 04:31.562
Please.
It's so five minutes ago.
Yeah.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.022
Oh.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.692
What are we doing?
Oh, I don't know.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.527
Why don't
we go see a movie?
Where?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.696
Omniplex?
Nee sitch. No way.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.282
No THX.
They don't
even have Dolby.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.617
Sorry.
Beverly Center.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.161
Oh, please.
They show previews
for foreign movies.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.537
Yeah.
AMC?

04:48.580 --> 04:49.789
Bogus corn.
Bogus corn.

04:49.873 --> 04:53.084
Totally stale
and the ushers are, like,
the acne patrol.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.794
Totally.
Okay, okay.

04:54.878 --> 04:58.631
How about we're
thinking... Pavilion?
Sitch solved?

04:58.715 --> 05:00.299
Sounds toasty.
We're going
to the Pavilion.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.134
Cool.
Excellent.
What's playing there?

05:02.219 --> 05:04.553
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.223
Excuse much.
Rude or anything?

05:07.307 --> 05:08.766
Nice ensemble.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.977
What a homeless.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.067
[Chattering,
Laughing]

05:21.571 --> 05:24.281
Is Jeffrey really spending
the night at your house?
[Movie: Man Screaming]

05:24.366 --> 05:27.368
That's the plan.
Ooh, what a sitch.

05:27.703 --> 05:30.329
Your parents are always
going away for the weekend.
You're so lucky.

05:30.414 --> 05:31.539
[Boy] Hey!
I guess.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.290
Mine don't.
I'm gonna die
a virgin.

05:33.375 --> 05:36.252
Would you guys
shut up please?
[Man Screaming]

05:36.378 --> 05:38.337
It could happen.

05:38.422 --> 05:41.132
[Girls Laughing]
God, what a 'tude.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.134
Boo!
[Imitates Buzzer]

05:43.218 --> 05:45.261
It's the Loch Ness monster!

05:46.263 --> 05:48.764
God.
Take a chill lozenge.

05:48.890 --> 05:51.267
Like we don't
have rights too.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.436
Ignore them, okay?
Ignore them.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.564
Oh, no, no.
I can't believe
these people.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.151
We paid good money
to see this.
No, we didn't.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.527
[Girls Laughing]
Oh, yeah.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.784
[Boy]
Look at the streets.
They're all lining up for me

06:08.869 --> 06:13.039
because I am the champ!
[Stereo: Rock]

06:13.123 --> 06:16.375
Whoo!
Hey, look at the moon, man.
It's a huge moon.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.378
Guys, we gotta do
something tonight.
We gotta go out and party!

06:19.463 --> 06:21.213
If you spent more time
at home sleeping,

06:21.298 --> 06:23.299
you'd spend less time
on the court sucking.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.177
You were a bonehead
out there yesterday.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.012
Anyway, I'm booked.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.014
Gotta spend
some quality time
with the little lady.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.474
Excuse me.
You pig.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.143
Pushover.
You're such a pushover.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.896
You guys are pathetic.
I'm blowing.
Andy, you coming with me?

06:37.022 --> 06:39.982
No, I'm gonna catch
a ride with Jeffrey.
Later.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.860
Slam dunk.
Later.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.738
[Continues]

06:45.822 --> 06:49.033
[Inaudible]

06:58.835 --> 07:02.588
Jeffrey, I don't wanna
sound sexist or anything,
but can I borrow her?

07:02.714 --> 07:05.966
Andy!
No way.
You'd get her dirty.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.718
He would, honey.
He's an animal.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.512
See you
at my house.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.222
Don't look.

07:12.057 --> 07:16.268
[Animal Howling
In Distance]

07:18.855 --> 07:20.898
[Coughs]

07:28.073 --> 07:31.784
[Faint Snarling]

07:31.868 --> 07:33.869
Oh, man.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.288
I'm not
in the mood for this.

07:36.748 --> 07:40.459
Okay, whoever's behind me
better be gone
when I turn around.

07:42.045 --> 07:46.090
What are you,
some kind of weirdo
or something? Huh?

07:46.299 --> 07:49.468
[Snarling]

07:51.638 --> 07:53.973
The apparent cause of death
was a severe neck wound

07:54.057 --> 07:58.227
that resembled,
in the words of one bystander,
"a really gross hickey."

07:58.645 --> 08:02.982
In a related story,
the body of the third
slasher victim, Jason Doofey,

08:03.066 --> 08:04.692
has disappeared
from the morgue.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.862
Oh, there it is.
Have fun. Be good.
Stay away from the Jag.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.572
I know.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.991
That's everything.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.326
Bye.
Kiss noise.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.120
Bye-bye, Bobby.
Bye!

08:16.204 --> 08:18.539
Another victim
was found today,
the fourth.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.793
And Lulu just can't
get pregnant.
[Continues Speaking]

08:23.336 --> 08:25.087
She thinks my name
is Bobby?

08:25.172 --> 08:27.923
It's possible she thinks
my name is Bobby.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.342
Real quality-timer, huh?

08:30.427 --> 08:33.636
Mmm.
Something like that.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.808
Yeah, it works for me.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.269
I mean, if they wanna
leave you alone
in the house,

08:40.352 --> 08:42.354
all helpless
and vulnerable...

08:42.563 --> 08:44.857
Well, the weather
hasn't disappointed us.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.193
Constant sun
and temperatures
in the high 70s

08:47.277 --> 08:50.112
have made every
winter's day a beach day.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.496
[Snarling]

09:02.125 --> 09:03.834
[Grunts]

09:05.921 --> 09:09.006
[Snarling]

09:16.848 --> 09:19.475
[Groans]

09:24.522 --> 09:28.317
Oh, please!
Show me a real Slayer.

09:28.526 --> 09:29.777
Lothos.

09:29.861 --> 09:34.198
Will you people never learn
we can't be stopped?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.328
[Laughs]

09:39.496 --> 09:42.790
[Thunderclap]
This is our world now.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.842
Wow.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.017
[Sighs]

10:02.102 --> 10:04.144
Mmm.

10:05.146 --> 10:10.067
Sleep, my master, my own.
Sleep.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.779
I have already begun
building you a new family.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.156
Soon we will be legion.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.868
When you rise,
we will claim
this place as our own.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.746
Rubies will drip
from your lips.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.549
Soon.

10:34.092 --> 10:37.011
The environment,
I'm telling you,
it's totally key.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.179
The Earth is in
terrible shape.
We could all die.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.016
Besides, Sting's doing it.
I thought he was
doing Indians.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.019
How about
the homelesses?
Um, move.

10:45.103 --> 10:48.230
Aren't there
any sicknesses that
aren't too depressing?

10:48.315 --> 10:49.481
Hi.
Hey there.

10:49.566 --> 10:50.774
What you guys doing?

10:51.151 --> 10:53.402
Senior dance. We need to
come up with a theme.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.738
A socially conscious theme.

10:55.822 --> 10:59.158
Yeah. "One that reflects
the students' growing
awareness of,

10:59.242 --> 11:01.410
and involvement in,
the world around them."

11:01.911 --> 11:04.079
[Jeffrey, Andy]
Downer!

11:04.164 --> 11:06.832
I still say the environment.
That's my suggestion.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.168
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, that's
a good one.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.295
What are the most
immediate threats

11:11.379 --> 11:13.797
to the world environment
right now?

11:14.132 --> 11:17.343
Um, litter?
[Andy] Litter. Yeah.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.094
Forest fires?

11:19.596 --> 11:20.679
Bugs?

11:20.764 --> 11:23.265
Bugs. Totally.
Yeah, I hate bugs.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.143
Yeah.
[Andy]
Cassandra, write it down.

11:26.269 --> 11:30.064
Guys, what do you think
about the ozone layer?
[School Bell Rings]

11:30.148 --> 11:31.899
Yeah.
What about it?
What?

11:31.983 --> 11:35.110
Yeah, we gotta get
rid of that.
First bell, people.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.446
Time marches on.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.199
What's your point?
Button it, Kramer.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.076
[Cassandra]
Let's meet tonight, okay?

11:42.160 --> 11:43.994
CafÃ© BlasÃ©?
Oh, cool.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.372
We can, like, figure
decorations and stuff.
Yeah.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.958
I don't know, guys.
I really wanna get
a head start on my homework.

11:51.628 --> 11:54.630
[Laughing]
I love that one.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.634
[Jukebox: Reggae Pop]

11:58.718 --> 12:02.805
Buff, I don't see
why we have to invite
every single senior.

12:03.098 --> 12:07.101
Because it's a senior dance.
Just a shot in the dark.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.061
[Jennifer] So?
My usual.

12:09.145 --> 12:12.106
[Nicki] Like, why do we
have to invite Nadia?
She's such a blemish.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.483
I know.
You're right.
She is.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.068
Hi.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.364
What?

12:20.448 --> 12:22.241
I thought that look was over.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.827
Well, it's retro.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.328
Yeah, retro.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.373
You can
borrow it sometime.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.083
Okay, maybe I will.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.211
We were talking
about the senior dance,
in case you're interested.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.588
[Whispering]
You guys,
look who's coming.

12:36.673 --> 12:40.384
Ew. Make me sick. Ugh.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.304
[Girls Laughing]

12:45.181 --> 12:47.224
What does it look like?

12:50.687 --> 12:53.188
Two coffees
or a hot dog.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.441
[Waitress] Nothing on it.
Nothing inside.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.733
[Quietly] Losers.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.236
I'm Charlotte.
I'll be your waitress.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.446
Thanks, Charlotte.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.366
You guys are thrashed.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.452
[Girl] Just a little.
Are we?

13:06.536 --> 13:08.287
[Girls Laughing]

13:08.496 --> 13:11.081
That would explain
the slurred speech.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.209
Thanks.
What's your name?

13:16.212 --> 13:17.838
Buffy.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.548
Yeah, it figures.

13:22.385 --> 13:23.510
I'm Pike.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.762
This is Benny.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.431
[Clicks Teeth]

13:29.225 --> 13:31.727
And I'm... I'm... Pike.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.521
Pike isn't a name.
It's a fish.

[Laughing]

13:37.567 --> 13:39.026
Don't we know you guys?

13:39.110 --> 13:40.861
Hey, wait a minute.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.489
You're the guys
from the movie.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.741
We hate you guys.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.202
Like we care, I'm sure.

Yeah. Boo-hoo.

[Girls Laughing]

[Muffled]
You guys were very rude,
okay? It was shocking.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.294
You just
snuck in anyway.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.629
Yeah.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.424
Hey, Buffy. You hungry?
I got something for ya.

[Pike]
I'll have it running
in about a week.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.733
All I need is
some brake pads,

14:19.817 --> 14:23.278
shocks, some tires,
new engine, maybe.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.696
[Benny]
It'll be totally cherry.

14:24.781 --> 14:28.242
When you get that car
together, man, let's bail,
get out of this town.

14:28.326 --> 14:31.203
Those rich bitches,
they're a plague.
They gotta be stopped.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.372
What, you didn't like 'em?
Give me that.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.959
They're all the same.
They're just so stuck-up.

14:37.043 --> 14:40.212
It's like they're
not even human.
I hate 'em.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.381
Yeah,
but would you bone 'em?

14:42.465 --> 14:45.926
Yes, definitely.
Definitely. Please, God.
Especially the blonde.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.554
Ooh, I'd give
my right eye
for a piece of that.

14:48.638 --> 14:51.265
Wait.
She's not even human.

14:51.349 --> 14:54.434
Yes, but her yabos
scoff at gravity.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.019
Oh, man,
you're disgusting.

14:56.104 --> 14:59.523
You don't even like her
and you'd sleep with her.
What is that?

14:59.983 --> 15:03.360
I got a news flash for you.
Another shot of this,
and I'll have sex with you.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.363
Oh, yeah.
Then you'll never call me.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.535
[Benny Groaning]

15:13.454 --> 15:14.997
I think I'm gonna ralph.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.874
Oh, hey, Benny,
I'm here for you, man.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.335
I'm here.

I'm here for you, Ralph.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.948

a very safe place
for you to fall asleep.

15:50.742 --> 15:53.744
Okay, Mom.

Shoot, shoot

16:01.711 --> 16:04.838
Take that ball
to the hoop, hoop

16:04.964 --> 16:07.132
All right. Yeah.
That's cute.
I like that.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.300
Bye.
See ya.

16:08.384 --> 16:12.137
I was thinking,
for the senior dance,
what if we made a big sign

16:12.221 --> 16:14.973
that says,
"Don't Tread on Me"?

16:15.058 --> 16:16.475
You know,
on a picture of the Earth.

16:17.477 --> 16:21.104
How do you not
tread on the Earth?
You kind of have to, right?

16:22.023 --> 16:25.442
Oh. Yeah, I never
thought of that. Yeah.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.818
I gotta bail.
You coming?

16:26.903 --> 16:28.820
No. You guys blow.
I'm waiting on Cassandra.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.615
She's gonna help me
with my history.
Wait, wait, wait.

16:32.575 --> 16:36.203
[Sighs]
I kind of loaned her
Kimberly's yellow leather

16:36.287 --> 16:39.498
jacket, so don't tell her,
all right?

16:39.749 --> 16:41.083
Okay, I won't.
See ya.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.250
Bye.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.016
[Gasps]
God!

16:58.101 --> 17:01.687
You scared me to death.
Where the hell
did you come from?

17:01.771 --> 17:05.357
That was very impressive,
the... the... the tumbling.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.692
What?

17:06.943 --> 17:09.819
Oh. I used
to do gymnastics.

17:09.904 --> 17:12.489
Are you looking
for somebody?

17:12.906 --> 17:14.825
I was looking
for you actually.

17:15.785 --> 17:19.329
Why? Am I in trouble
or something? 'Cause if
I am, I didn't do it.

17:19.414 --> 17:22.874
[Chuckles]
No, you're not in trouble.
I am. I'm years late.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.751
You should have
been taught, prepared.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.796
But I wasn't certain
until just now
that it was you.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.048
What are you
talking about?

17:30.133 --> 17:33.385
I'm saying that I've been
searching everywhere
for you, Buffy.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.012
Why?

17:36.597 --> 17:38.598
To bring you
your birthright.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.392
My birthright?

17:40.476 --> 17:43.061
Is... Is that like
a trust fund
or something?

17:43.479 --> 17:47.816
I think it will be easier
for you to understand
this birthright

17:48.609 --> 17:49.901
if I show it to you.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.903
All right?

17:51.988 --> 17:55.365
So you come with me now
to the graveyard.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.242
[Groans]

17:57.744 --> 18:00.328
No. No, no, no.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.081
My trust fund's
in the graveyard?

18:03.624 --> 18:05.417
God, what's your damage?

18:06.169 --> 18:07.210
Buffy?

18:07.295 --> 18:09.671
[Exhales]
You're one of those
skanky old men

18:09.756 --> 18:12.007
that attacks little girls
and stuff, right?

18:12.467 --> 18:13.759
Well, forget you.

18:14.177 --> 18:17.846
My name is Merrick,
and you have been
chosen, Buffy.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.600
[Exhales]
Chosen to go
to the graveyard?

18:21.684 --> 18:24.603
Why don't you just take
the first runner-up, okay?

18:24.687 --> 18:26.563
Everything depends
on you, Buffy.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.484
You must come with me now
to the graveyard
while there's still time.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.569
Time to do what?

18:33.029 --> 18:36.782
Time to stop the killing,
to stop the vampires.

18:36.866 --> 18:40.368
All right. Let me
get this straight, okay?

18:40.703 --> 18:44.122
You want me to go
to the graveyard with you

18:44.207 --> 18:48.043
because I'm the "Chosen One"
and there are vampires?

18:48.628 --> 18:49.878
Yes.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.714
Does Elvis talk to you?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.633
Does he tell you
to do things?

18:54.717 --> 18:56.885
Do you see spots?

18:57.386 --> 18:58.553
Spots?

18:58.638 --> 19:01.973
Yes, of course.
That's your proof.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.892
Spots.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.520
You bear the mark.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.396
You bear the mark
of the coven.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.565
What, that big
old hairy mole?

19:10.650 --> 19:12.818
Ew. I had
that thing removed.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.321
Besides, you knowing
about my big old mole
doesn't prove anything.

19:16.656 --> 19:20.450
Except for it's
way past medication time
for you, buddy.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.202
So why don't you just
stay away from me, okay?

19:22.286 --> 19:24.329
Do you ever dream
that you were
someone else, Buffy?

19:24.413 --> 19:25.622
Everybody does.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.165
No, someone in the past.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.709
Someone real.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.920
A Magyar
peasant girl perhaps.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.214
An Indian princess?

19:34.298 --> 19:36.091
A slave?

19:39.762 --> 19:41.429
I was a slave.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.931
In Virginia.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.308
I... I don't know.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.811
There was, like, this
big farm or something.

19:49.772 --> 19:54.359
There was this one
where there were
these knights and I'm a...

19:55.069 --> 19:57.696
A servant girl.
A barmaid.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.782
Oh, my God.

20:02.451 --> 20:06.288
Oh, my God.
I never told anybody
about this.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.665
There's this one
where there's this man.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.585
I think he's a man.
He's in my dreams sometimes.

20:11.669 --> 20:16.256
I'm fighting him...
Always fighting him.
[Laughs]

20:16.340 --> 20:18.341
But he's so strong.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.719
His name is Lothos.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.350
How do you know
all this?

20:27.435 --> 20:30.729
Because it is your birthright,
and I am a part of it.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.941
You come with me
to the graveyard,

20:36.360 --> 20:37.819
and I will show you.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.452
I can't believe
I'm doing this.
[Animals Howling]

20:45.536 --> 20:48.246
I can't believe
I'm in a graveyard
with a strange man,

20:48.331 --> 20:51.583
hunting for vampires
on a school night.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.668
Ew.

20:54.045 --> 20:57.505
Why did you never tell anyone
about your dreams?

20:57.590 --> 21:01.635
Oh, right.
Tell everybody I'm crazy?
Beauty idea.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.178
Ow!

21:03.638 --> 21:04.846
Cramps?

21:05.348 --> 21:08.224
None of your
business. God!
This is it.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.436
Robert Berman was killed
three days ago,

21:11.520 --> 21:14.606
and his body was found
in the bushes by the canal.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.984
Extensive tissue damage.

21:18.069 --> 21:21.196
Tearing
at the neck and shoulders.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.533
Take these.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.663
Wait a minute.
No, no. You won't
have to do anything.

21:29.747 --> 21:32.582
They're just
for your protection.
Sit there.

21:33.584 --> 21:36.002
I just need you to watch.

21:37.046 --> 21:38.380
[Exhales]

21:39.048 --> 21:41.883
All right.
What do we do now?

21:42.009 --> 21:45.553
We wait
for Robert Berman to wake up.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.892
Do you have any gum?

21:52.311 --> 21:54.396

23:48.761 --> 23:52.680
Where you been, man?
I tried to call your house
like 50 times.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.432
I've been hanging.
Hanging?

23:54.517 --> 23:56.267
You left me hanging.
I almost pulled a Hendrix.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.937
Come on. Let me in.
This weird guy
gave me a ride home.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.106
I thought he was
gonna hit on me.

24:01.190 --> 24:03.525
Come on.
Invite me in, Pike.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.652
Wait a minute, man.
What's wrong with you?

24:06.779 --> 24:07.862
I'm fine.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.572
You look like shit, man.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.283
Well, I feel pretty.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.005
Let me in, Pike.
I'm hungry.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.092
I fought the law
and the law won
Go home, Ben.

24:29.176 --> 24:30.301
I'm hungry.

24:30.386 --> 24:33.263
You're floating.
Come on, man!
Get away from here!

24:33.347 --> 24:34.514
I'm hungry.

24:34.598 --> 24:37.684
I'm hungry!
I'm hungry!

24:38.144 --> 24:39.561
[Laughing]

24:45.734 --> 24:48.319
Now, Buffy,

24:48.404 --> 24:51.156
you go to school tomorrow
and act normally.

24:51.240 --> 24:55.160
Don't let anyone know
you know what's happening.
This is important.

24:55.244 --> 24:58.204
Because once the vampires
find out who you are,

24:58.914 --> 25:01.082
you won't be
hunting them anymore.

25:01.167 --> 25:04.002
You understand?
They mustn't know
your name.

25:04.086 --> 25:05.920
All right.

25:06.130 --> 25:09.215
Meet me at this address
tomorrow after school.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.261
I have cheerleading
practice, okay?

25:13.345 --> 25:15.305
Well, you're going
to have to skip it.

25:19.143 --> 25:22.478
They can't come in
unless you invite them in.
Is that true?

25:22.938 --> 25:24.689
That's true. Mm-hmm.

25:25.733 --> 25:26.941
Good.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.946
[Engine Starts]

25:35.951 --> 25:37.702
Do you know
what time it is?

25:37.786 --> 25:40.496
Uh... Around 10:00?

25:40.581 --> 25:42.373
Oh! I knew
this thing was slow.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.417
You pay a fortune
for something...

25:44.501 --> 25:47.003
Honey, come on!
We're gonna be late!

26:41.934 --> 26:44.143
[Panting]

26:53.404 --> 26:57.073
Wake up, sweetie.
You'll be late for school.

26:57.700 --> 27:00.285
Are we having
a nightmare, Cassandra?

27:00.369 --> 27:02.495
He knows you're awake.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.707
Your heartbeat sounds out
to him like thunder.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.214
Oh, my God.

27:14.341 --> 27:17.218
[Sinister laughter]

27:18.137 --> 27:20.221
Who are you?

27:22.057 --> 27:24.851
[Sinister laughter]

27:28.564 --> 27:30.523
[Jennifer]
Oh, hi.
Wow. You're late.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.734
I'm gonna practice.
Cool.
See you out there.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.152
Okay, bye.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.117
[Gasps]
Oh, God!

27:41.201 --> 27:44.537
What are you doing here?
This is a naked place.

27:44.621 --> 27:47.540
You were supposed
to meet me an hour ago.

27:48.584 --> 27:51.044
I told you that
I have practice.

27:51.128 --> 27:52.503
And I told you to skip it.

27:52.588 --> 27:56.007
Listen, I think there's been
a big mistake, all right?

27:56.216 --> 28:00.511
I appreciate that there are
real vampires and that you're
on this big holy mission,

28:00.596 --> 28:05.099
but obviously somebody read
their tea leaves wrong
'cause I'm not your girl.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.851
And I don't think
I'm up to it.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.562
And just between you and me,
neither do you.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.356
It is true.

28:11.815 --> 28:15.193
You have missed
years of training.

28:15.486 --> 28:16.527
See?

28:16.612 --> 28:19.781
And you are
undisciplined, frivolous.

28:20.324 --> 28:21.449
Don't I know it.

28:21.575 --> 28:25.370
Quite probably
the most vacuous choice
in my entire...

28:25.454 --> 28:28.456
Okay. Okay.
I think we both get the point.

28:29.291 --> 28:30.541
Right.

28:30.626 --> 28:33.294
Then I don't think
there's anything more
for us to say.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.797
I guess not.

28:36.799 --> 28:38.424
Good luck and all.

28:44.181 --> 28:46.391
[Girls Cheering
In Distance]
Oh, yes.

28:46.475 --> 28:50.645
There is one thing.

28:51.105 --> 28:52.522
What?

28:52.731 --> 28:54.023
This.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.610
Bravo.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.404
[Gasps]

28:59.488 --> 29:01.948
You... You... You threw
a knife at my head.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.950
Yes. I had to show you.

29:04.868 --> 29:08.579
But you threw
a knife at my head.

29:08.664 --> 29:12.500
And you caught it.
Only the Chosen One
could have caught it.

29:12.626 --> 29:15.586
Don't you get it?
I don't want to be
the Chosen One.

29:15.671 --> 29:19.507
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life
chasing after vampires.

29:19.633 --> 29:22.677
All I want to do
is graduate from high school,

29:22.761 --> 29:25.346
go to Europe,
marry Christian Slater
and die.

29:25.764 --> 29:29.976
It may not sound too exciting
to a scone-head like you,
but I think it's swell.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.062
You come along
and tell me I'm a member
of the hairy mole club,

29:33.147 --> 29:35.314
so you can
throw things at me?

29:36.066 --> 29:38.025
Buffy, it was necessary.

29:38.444 --> 29:41.696
Last night,
you knew I was sitting
in a fresh grave, didn't you?

29:41.780 --> 29:44.449
Yes, because I had
to make you aware
of the implica...

29:44.533 --> 29:45.616
[Groans]

29:45.701 --> 29:47.410
Oh. Wow.

29:48.579 --> 29:49.871
[Groaning]

29:49.955 --> 29:52.039
I...
I never hit anybody before.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.877
[Muffled]
Really?
Well, you did it perfectly.

29:56.712 --> 29:58.796
I didn't even break a nail.

30:00.007 --> 30:02.341
[Pop Intro]

30:08.474 --> 30:11.058
Yeah
[Grunting]

30:16.315 --> 30:17.398
Yeah

30:17.733 --> 30:21.360
I admit you got
the biggest brown eyes
[Yelling]

30:21.737 --> 30:26.073
And you know how to bite
your lips to tantalize

30:26.158 --> 30:27.450
Sure

30:28.577 --> 30:29.952
Yeah

30:30.037 --> 30:34.081
You can get any girl
you want going
And you do it

30:34.750 --> 30:38.044
And don't say you don't know
'cause you do

30:39.922 --> 30:44.759
Well, baby, I ain't gonna
eat out my heart anymore

30:44.843 --> 30:48.846
I ain't gonna
eat out my heart anymore

30:48.931 --> 30:53.351
I ain't gonna eat out
my heart anymore

30:53.435 --> 30:55.311
So quit it

30:58.440 --> 31:02.360
I love you, I love you
I do, boy

31:02.444 --> 31:06.447
But you ain't
gonna cheat on me

31:06.532 --> 31:09.867
I need you, I need you
I do, boy

31:09.952 --> 31:17.583
Choose
Is it her or me?

31:17.668 --> 31:18.960
[Yells]
Yeah

31:21.129 --> 31:24.131
Just 'cause I
have a say input

31:24.216 --> 31:30.054
You should be ashamed
of what I've been seeing

31:30.597 --> 31:31.889
Yeah

31:31.974 --> 31:36.269
You better watch
your step or, boy,
you're gonna lose

31:36.728 --> 31:40.606
The best thing
you ever had

31:41.358 --> 31:42.900
Oh, oh

31:42.985 --> 31:46.821
I ain't gonna eat
out my heart anymore

31:46.989 --> 31:50.658
[Yelling]
I ain't gonna eat
out my heart anymore

31:50.742 --> 31:54.537
I ain't gonna eat
out my heart anymore

31:55.163 --> 31:57.540
So quit it
Ha!

31:59.293 --> 32:02.003
[Fades]

32:02.838 --> 32:04.964
The heart.
Remember?

32:05.257 --> 32:08.301
So when do I meet
this guy Lothos?

32:08.427 --> 32:09.760
I don't know.

32:10.387 --> 32:14.390
When he comes to you
in your dreams,
what does he do to you?

32:14.474 --> 32:15.850
How does he make you feel?

32:17.686 --> 32:21.022
He, uh...
He scares me.

32:22.024 --> 32:25.610
Well, I think
we can safely say

32:25.694 --> 32:28.154
that there's something
going on with you, Buffy.

32:29.906 --> 32:34.118
Now, there's nothing
to be nervous about.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.746
You're not
in any kind of trouble.

32:36.872 --> 32:41.751
Don't think of me
as Gary Murray,
administrator.

32:41.835 --> 32:46.672
No. Think of me
as Gary Murray, party guy,

32:46.757 --> 32:49.300
a happenin' dude
who can talk to the young.

32:49.384 --> 32:54.055
So tell me.
It's drugs, isn't it?

32:54.264 --> 32:55.723
Hey, I know where
you're coming from.

32:55.807 --> 32:56.932
[Insect Buzzing]

32:57.017 --> 33:00.102
Believe me, I've had
my drug experiences.

33:00.187 --> 33:02.396
Oh, yeah.
I did a lot...

33:02.481 --> 33:04.857
Well, some acid
in the '60s.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.984
[Buzzing]
See, I was at a...

33:07.069 --> 33:09.654
I was at
a Doobie Brothers concert,

33:09.738 --> 33:13.658
and I could see
the music flowing into,
flowing into me.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.035
It was bright red
and electric.

33:16.370 --> 33:19.789
And I... I felt like
I was a big, uh,
a big toaster, you know?

33:19.915 --> 33:22.708
[Buzzing]
And I thought, "Well,
maybe I am a toaster,

33:22.793 --> 33:24.919
and we're all molecules."

33:25.003 --> 33:28.381
My friend Melissa,
her head looked like
a big party balloon,

33:28.465 --> 33:31.092
and that...
Boy, whoo-hoo,
that scared me.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.802
[Buzzing Stops]

33:33.970 --> 33:38.015
Then I, uh...
I... I started to freak out.

33:39.893 --> 33:42.186
You said you'd have
the part by 2:00.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.271
Christ, it's almost dark.

33:46.316 --> 33:49.860
What nasty bug crawled
up your bungus? Where
the hell are you going?

33:49.945 --> 33:52.029
I'm leavin', man.
I'm bailin' town.

33:52.114 --> 33:54.782
This place has gotten
way too hairy.

33:54.866 --> 33:58.244
Where the hell am I gonna
find a mechanic stupid enough
to work for my kind of money?

33:58.328 --> 33:59.787
Seen Benny lately?

33:59.871 --> 34:01.789
No.
[Grunts]

34:02.749 --> 34:05.710
Hey. Why, you want me
to give him a message?

34:05.794 --> 34:09.964
You should think
about leaving too, man.
Sell this place.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.632
There's something
going on around here.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.217
I don't know.
Something real weird.

34:16.638 --> 34:19.264
Hey, what do you want me
to do if I see Benny?

34:19.558 --> 34:20.808
Run.

34:32.027 --> 34:34.071
Nice night for a walk.

34:40.203 --> 34:43.080
God, it's cold,

34:43.165 --> 34:44.290
dark.

34:54.967 --> 34:57.011

34:59.097 --> 35:03.225
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Feelings

35:04.269 --> 35:08.522
Boy, I'm feeling
really helpless

35:08.607 --> 35:10.357
Oh, God.

35:11.151 --> 35:13.110
[Groans]
[Creaking]

35:13.195 --> 35:14.653
Wait.

35:15.697 --> 35:17.364
Hello?

35:21.119 --> 35:22.286
[Gasps]

35:39.596 --> 35:40.721
[Gasps]

35:40.806 --> 35:42.515
[Stopwatch Clicks]

35:43.058 --> 35:44.558
Toaster-kicked him.

35:44.893 --> 35:47.853
It was a trap, get it?
I led him in.

35:47.938 --> 35:50.856
It was a blind alley,
get it?

35:50.941 --> 35:53.567
If there'd been
any more of them,
you would be dead by now.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.654
You must never forget
the cardinal rule, Buffy.

35:56.738 --> 36:00.741
One vampire is a lot easier
to kill than 10.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.577
Does the word "duh"
mean anything to you?

36:04.287 --> 36:06.539
You felt sick, didn't you?

36:06.623 --> 36:08.415
You had cramps?

36:08.875 --> 36:10.668
Nice conversationalist.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.753
Yeah, I felt them a little.

36:12.838 --> 36:16.382
But I'm not due for
another couple of weeks, since
you're so hot on the subject.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.008
Of course you're not.

36:18.093 --> 36:20.761
It was a natural reaction
on the part of the Slayer.

36:21.096 --> 36:23.681
A reaction
to their unnaturalness.

36:23.765 --> 36:27.142
And you're going
to be able to use that
to track them.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.519
Great.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.896
My secret weapon
is P.M.S.

36:31.273 --> 36:33.232
That's just terrific.
Thanks for telling me.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.277
It's not a weapon.
It's an alert system.

36:36.611 --> 36:41.073
Well, aren't we kung fu.
I don't see you out there
killing any vampires.

36:41.157 --> 36:43.284
No, I play my part.

36:44.077 --> 36:48.080
You can play
with your part all you want,
but it's my neck on the block.

36:48.874 --> 36:51.000
I'm out there
risking my life.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.961
I'm risking my life,
and you're not
doing anything.

36:56.381 --> 37:00.009
I train girls to be Slayers.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.845
I have done so
for a hundred lives,

37:02.929 --> 37:04.889
and I shall continue
to do so.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.433
I am born each time
with the knowledge

37:07.517 --> 37:11.770
that my purpose is
to prepare the Chosen One

37:11.855 --> 37:13.272
for her battle.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.899
I am not a Slayer,

37:14.983 --> 37:18.152
and I must not interfere
even if I want to,

37:18.486 --> 37:23.032
even if I think
that this time the girl

37:23.116 --> 37:25.492
is truly exceptional.

37:29.164 --> 37:33.417
So, uh, what...
What do you do?

37:33.501 --> 37:39.006
I mean, you just keep on
living the same old life
over and over?

37:39.341 --> 37:41.967
Yes. Yes, until...

37:42.052 --> 37:45.262
What, until there aren't
any more vampires?
Then what?

37:45.347 --> 37:47.723
Oh, then maybe
I'll go to heaven.

37:47.807 --> 37:50.851
[Scoffs]
Or maybe you'll
just get a job.

37:51.269 --> 37:55.606
Oh, a job.
I would have been
a wonderful boot-maker.

37:55.732 --> 37:59.234
That is so dull.
I'm going to be a buyer.

37:59.778 --> 38:00.986
Of what?

38:01.071 --> 38:02.196
I don't know.

38:02.280 --> 38:06.033
It's just a job I heard of.
It sounded pretty cool,
you know?

38:07.410 --> 38:10.621
Buying, buyer, to buy.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.498
I like that.

38:19.881 --> 38:21.966
We should go to work.

38:22.050 --> 38:26.220
Yeah. Quick,
before anybody has any fun.

38:28.098 --> 38:30.224
Merrick, I'm not gonna
croak that easily.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.060
I have something
that the other girls
didn't have.

38:33.186 --> 38:35.396
And what
might that be, pray?

38:36.231 --> 38:38.273
My keen fashion sense.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.026
Oh, vampires
of the world, beware.

38:41.111 --> 38:43.237
[Laughing]
Merrick, you made a joke.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.239
That's good.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.449
Are you all right?
Do you wanna lie down?

38:47.534 --> 38:49.994
I know it hurts
for the first time, but...

38:51.246 --> 38:53.288
it was a good joke.

38:56.584 --> 39:00.504
[Engine Cranking]
[Pike]
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.047
[Engine Dies]

39:02.132 --> 39:03.298
Come on.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.426
[Engine Cranking]

39:05.593 --> 39:07.678
This is not my night.

39:20.150 --> 39:22.818
[Sinister Laughter]

39:23.445 --> 39:25.320
[Engine Cranking]
Come on, baby.
This is for the money.

39:25.405 --> 39:27.281
Make me proud. Come on.

39:27.449 --> 39:29.408
[Cranking]
Okay, come on.

39:29.492 --> 39:31.952
[Engine Starts]
Yes. All right.

39:33.121 --> 39:35.998
[Tires Squealing]
[Pike]
Excuse me.

39:38.418 --> 39:41.170
[Snarling]
[Yelling]

39:52.474 --> 39:54.349
Get off my car, dude.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.814
[Man Singing, Indistinct]

40:10.992 --> 40:13.660
Come on.
[Sinister Laughter]

40:14.662 --> 40:21.251
[Gasps, Screams]

41:01.709 --> 41:03.961
[Screaming]

41:04.045 --> 41:06.046
[Horn Steadily Honking]

41:08.383 --> 41:10.050
[Honking Stops]
[Groaning]

41:14.055 --> 41:15.639
[Snarling]

41:15.890 --> 41:18.559
[Pike]
Oh, give me a break.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.978
You ruined my new jacket.

41:22.063 --> 41:23.564
Kill him a lot.

41:24.482 --> 41:27.985
[Sinister Laughter]
[Grunts]

41:33.867 --> 41:37.619
[Groans]

41:46.629 --> 41:47.796
Hi.
Uh...

41:47.922 --> 41:50.465
Is that your van?
Yeah, it was, just
somebody jumped...

41:50.550 --> 41:51.884
[Snarls]

42:02.937 --> 42:04.771
[Vampire Groaning]

42:05.648 --> 42:07.566
Interesting choice.

42:07.942 --> 42:09.735
Last-minute decision.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.904
Sorry about
your guitar.

42:12.113 --> 42:14.740
Hey, you're
that weird guy.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.494
Oh, yeah.

42:19.579 --> 42:21.371
You've been hurt.
Oh, no.

42:21.456 --> 42:25.209
You know what they say?
Any one you can walk
away from is a good...

42:26.085 --> 42:27.669
You know
this guy?

42:27.754 --> 42:29.296
Well, somewhat.

42:29.547 --> 42:34.134
He's rather fond
of passing out
just as I happen by.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.308
You doin' all right?
You okay?

42:41.392 --> 42:44.645
Yeah, I'm good.
I, you know, kinda miss
my knees though.

42:44.729 --> 42:47.064
You want some water
or anything?

42:47.148 --> 42:49.858
Kitchen's in here.
Nope. Got it covered.

42:50.485 --> 42:51.818
[Exhales]

43:02.872 --> 43:05.791
So you do this a lot?
I mean, it's like
a hobby for you?

43:05.875 --> 43:07.501
Ow! Not exactly.

43:09.921 --> 43:12.547
They were vampires,
weren't they?

43:12.632 --> 43:13.882
[Sighs]

43:15.510 --> 43:19.096
Yeah.
God! Vampires.
Unbelievable.

43:19.180 --> 43:20.764
[Ice Rattling]

43:21.557 --> 43:24.685
You had a carful of stuff.
Were you leaving?

43:24.769 --> 43:26.395
Yeah, I was bailin'.

43:26.479 --> 43:29.189
I got this friend,
and he's really...

43:29.274 --> 43:31.566
Well, he's really
a vampire, I guess.

43:31.651 --> 43:35.153
It's not a good scene.
It's a bad scene,
and tomorrow I'm on a bus.

43:35.238 --> 43:36.363
I'm outta here.

43:37.448 --> 43:38.532
Wow. Are you okay?

43:38.616 --> 43:41.201
No, I'm fine. Um...
You sure?

43:41.286 --> 43:42.869
It doesn't hurt.

43:44.247 --> 43:45.372
Okay.

43:46.791 --> 43:48.417
Who are you?

43:48.710 --> 43:51.128
I'm sorry, but you seem
like such a flake.

43:51.212 --> 43:53.297
And I mean that
in a good way really.

43:53.381 --> 43:57.092
It's just, you know, hey,
I can keep talking until
you strike me dead or not.

43:57.218 --> 44:00.387
I prefer not.
Things are
kinda confusing.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.055
I'll buy that.

44:03.725 --> 44:06.810
Three weeks ago,
all I could think about was...

44:06.894 --> 44:08.937
I didn't actually
think about anything,

44:09.022 --> 44:10.856
but I definitely
didn't expect this.

44:11.441 --> 44:14.860
You know what it's like
when everything
is suddenly different?

44:14.944 --> 44:21.116
And everything
you thought was crucial
seems... Seems so stupid.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.327
[Scoffs]
You find yourself

44:24.537 --> 44:28.290
babbling incoherently
to a strange man
in your living room.

44:33.087 --> 44:36.340
Are you calling me a man?

44:45.600 --> 44:47.601
Um, I'm gonna go to bed.

44:48.811 --> 44:51.813
If you want, um, to stay,

44:51.898 --> 44:54.107
you can stay
in the guest room.

44:54.567 --> 44:57.277
Nah. I'll stay right here.

44:57.362 --> 44:59.654
Make sure the sun comes up
and everything.

45:01.574 --> 45:02.657
Okay.

45:04.911 --> 45:06.787
I know what it's like.

45:09.832 --> 45:10.916
Hmm.

45:16.172 --> 45:17.714
You fool.

45:17.799 --> 45:21.635
You left the others behind
because of a little thing
like this

45:21.719 --> 45:23.762
on their first kill.

45:24.931 --> 45:26.640
He took my arm.

45:28.184 --> 45:30.143
It was your own fault.

45:30.812 --> 45:32.729
Reckless imbecile.

45:33.439 --> 45:38.735
The City of Angels
is ours for the taking,
but you...

45:38.820 --> 45:40.487
1,200 years old...

45:41.489 --> 45:43.615
You behave like a child.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.952
I had him in my grasp.

45:48.413 --> 45:49.830
Cheer up.

45:50.164 --> 45:51.748
You may still.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.086
Do something about that arm.
It looks horrible.

45:57.171 --> 46:00.132
Honestly, I don't know
how you made it
through the Crusades.

46:01.843 --> 46:03.927
I'll be in my chamber...

46:04.846 --> 46:06.138
[Cat Mewing]

46:06.222 --> 46:08.306
Having a little snack.

46:12.353 --> 46:13.854
[Hisses]

46:15.231 --> 46:18.442
And now they found
Cassandra's body
in the hills.

46:18.526 --> 46:21.445
I know. It'd been
there for weeks.
All icky.

46:21.529 --> 46:23.238
It's awful.
It's awful.

46:23.364 --> 46:26.074
She still had my jacket.
[Gasps]
The yellow leather?

46:26.159 --> 46:29.578
You didn't get
that back from her?
Oh, I'm so sorry.

46:30.663 --> 46:32.164
[Kimberly]
I loved that jacket.

46:32.248 --> 46:34.458
They're having some kind
of memorial service
or something tomorrow.

46:34.542 --> 46:36.251
You goin'?
I don't know.

46:36.335 --> 46:38.044
Coach says I gotta
work on my abs.

46:38.129 --> 46:40.964
Oh, gotta get some...
Whoa!

46:41.466 --> 46:43.758
[Girls Squeal]
[Grunts]

46:45.511 --> 46:47.512
Whoa! Whoa! I'm sorry.

46:47.597 --> 46:49.890
I'm sorry!
I don't actually
need any right now.

46:50.600 --> 46:53.059
Hey, what is it with you?
Don't grab me, okay?

46:53.811 --> 46:56.605
Absolutely.
I see now the error
of my mistake.

46:57.148 --> 47:00.734
Hey, keep your hand
off my "thang."
I'll pop you one.

47:01.319 --> 47:04.905
Did he scare you?
I can take care
of myself, all right?

47:04.989 --> 47:07.991
So I noticed.
[Andy]
Yo, Jeff.

47:08.618 --> 47:11.286
[Scoffs]
It's nice to feel needed.
[Clears Throat]

47:11.370 --> 47:13.705
Let's move out!
Yes!

47:15.041 --> 47:16.708
I've missed
three practices already.

47:16.792 --> 47:19.669
If I'm not at that
game tomorrow, everybody's
gonna start talking.

47:19.754 --> 47:21.963
It's just
another distraction.
It isn't right.

47:22.048 --> 47:24.341
[Sighs]
Why, because it isn't my fate?

47:24.425 --> 47:26.176
It isn't in The Book
of All Knowledgefulness

47:26.260 --> 47:28.637
that I'm gonna be cheering
at the Riverview game
tomorrow?

47:28.721 --> 47:30.013
Lighten up, Merrick.

47:30.097 --> 47:32.599
None of the other girls
ever gave me this much
trouble.

47:33.392 --> 47:35.769
And where are they now? Hello.

47:39.273 --> 47:42.234
Therefore,
if we all work together,
together it'll all work out.

47:42.318 --> 47:44.736
Are you with me?
Now get out there!

47:44.820 --> 47:46.988
All right!
Score some, uh, points.

47:47.073 --> 47:48.782
Hey, wait.
You missed practice
again today.

47:48.866 --> 47:51.868
I think you better sit down
and think about how
that made me feel.

47:51.953 --> 47:53.787
[Whistle Blows]

47:53.996 --> 47:56.873
Share it!
Go, team. Go.

47:56.958 --> 47:59.376

48:04.298 --> 48:06.049
[Buffy]
Ready? Okay.

48:06.467 --> 48:08.552
[Together]
How funky is your chicken?

48:08.636 --> 48:10.554
How funky is your chicken?

48:10.638 --> 48:12.597
How loose is your goose?

48:12.682 --> 48:14.683
Our goose is totally loose

48:14.767 --> 48:16.810
So come on,
all you Hog fans

48:16.894 --> 48:20.480
So come on, all you hog fans
and shake your caboose

48:20.565 --> 48:22.482
Whoo!
And shake your caboose

Two, four, eight...
[Whistle Blows]

48:30.199 --> 48:32.033
Murph, come on out.
This is it. You're in.

48:32.118 --> 48:34.244
And remember,
you're special.

48:34.328 --> 48:37.747
Thanks.
All right! Assert
your personhood.

48:37.832 --> 48:40.333
Actualize! Actualize!
[Buzzer Sounds]

48:40.585 --> 48:42.836

Share it! Extend your auras!

48:44.547 --> 48:46.172
[Whistle Blows]

48:48.843 --> 48:51.344
[Coach]
More polite! More polite!

48:51.512 --> 48:53.305
Stagger them
with your politeness.

48:54.432 --> 48:58.184
I'm open! Grueller, I'm open!

49:01.022 --> 49:03.690
Aha!
That'll show 'em.

49:04.817 --> 49:06.943
[Humming]
[Cheering]

49:07.028 --> 49:09.946
Coach, we can't have this.
That's not right.
We gotta get him out.

49:10.031 --> 49:11.823
It is reprehensible,
but the points
count, right?

49:11.907 --> 49:13.241
Get him out.
Yeah. Okay.

49:14.535 --> 49:16.661
[Snarls]
Ugh!

49:18.414 --> 49:19.956
Take it, man.

49:22.293 --> 49:23.627
Grueller? No.

49:24.253 --> 49:25.337
Will you go get him out?

49:28.966 --> 49:30.175
Aha!

49:30.718 --> 49:33.637
Grueller's pretty much
abandoned the concept
of zones.

49:34.805 --> 49:37.724
[Snarls, Hisses]

49:39.393 --> 49:42.270

There's a girl on the court!

Buffy!
He knows who I am!

49:58.204 --> 49:59.996
Yeah, the gearbox...
Hah! [Laughs]

50:00.122 --> 50:02.415
Hey, Eric.
Must be halftime.
[Grunts]

50:02.500 --> 50:06.044
Oh! Hey, babe, You wanna
get some real power
between your legs?

50:06.253 --> 50:07.879
[Growling]
[Buffy]
Yeah, I do.

50:07.963 --> 50:09.673

50:09.757 --> 50:12.509
Dyke! You're a dyke!

I'm telling the world!

Ha, ha.

51:28.377 --> 51:29.878
[Groans]

51:30.880 --> 51:32.505
Someone get an ouchy?

51:32.840 --> 51:35.675
Grueller, it's me.
Remember me? Buffy.

51:35.843 --> 51:38.178
We used to hang.
My birthday party?

51:38.262 --> 51:41.431
You drank all the
blueberry schnapps and
looged on my mom?

51:41.515 --> 51:44.726
[Snarling]
You were my friend.

51:45.019 --> 51:47.187
Now I'm a god.

51:56.405 --> 51:58.948
[Grunting]
Oh!

52:00.159 --> 52:01.284
Geek.

52:01.368 --> 52:02.786
[Snarling]
Ooh! Here we go!

52:02.870 --> 52:07.165
[Groaning]

52:13.672 --> 52:15.715
Look! Air.
Huh? [Groans]

52:20.095 --> 52:21.763
[Vampire Groans]

52:23.349 --> 52:24.849
Hi.
Hi.

52:25.351 --> 52:29.437
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
I'm saving your butt.

52:29.522 --> 52:31.815
Well, there was sort of
an exchange of butts.

52:31.899 --> 52:33.858
At least I didn't faint.

52:34.902 --> 52:38.029
Pike, you shouldn't
have come back.

52:38.948 --> 52:40.615
What am I gonna do, run?

52:40.699 --> 52:42.325
[Chuckling]
Where am I gonna go?

52:42.409 --> 52:45.870
These guys are everywhere,
and I wanna do some damage.

52:45.955 --> 52:47.664
I'm good with damage.

52:47.748 --> 52:49.582
I better find Merrick.

52:59.927 --> 53:02.679
I didn't expect
to see you so soon.

53:06.600 --> 53:10.186
I know that guy.
That is a bad guy.
Can we go, please?

53:10.271 --> 53:12.522
[Lothos]
Has our time
finally come?

53:13.274 --> 53:15.275
Have you ripened so fast?

53:15.943 --> 53:17.318
Come closer.

53:18.571 --> 53:19.946
Look at me.

53:22.575 --> 53:24.742
Does anybody here have
a problem with this but me?

[Heartbeat Pounding]

53:31.000 --> 53:34.669
Come into my eyes. Yes?
[Pike] Hey.

53:37.923 --> 53:39.132
Hello!

53:39.508 --> 53:40.758
This is not
a caring nurturer.

53:40.843 --> 53:43.803
This guy's
a bloodsucking fiend
from beyond the grave.

53:43.888 --> 53:47.682
Will you be wagging
that jaw of yours
while I'm biting it off?

53:48.475 --> 53:50.435
Are you addressing I?

53:50.644 --> 53:52.896
[Lothos]
Who's ready to stop me?

53:53.981 --> 53:56.024
It's not you, Merrick.

53:56.734 --> 53:58.735
You finally
brought me someone real,

54:00.321 --> 54:01.988
but is she ready?

54:02.615 --> 54:04.866
Actually, she's quite
a pain in the ass.

54:05.618 --> 54:07.994
What a pity.
[Pike]
Your move, Merrick.

54:09.330 --> 54:10.830
Come on, lefty.

54:10.998 --> 54:14.250
You remember what happened
the last time
you messed with me.

54:14.335 --> 54:15.793
I remember.

54:16.420 --> 54:17.503
Shit!

54:17.838 --> 54:19.297
Aaah!

54:19.673 --> 54:21.090
[Groans]

54:21.300 --> 54:23.509
She's not ready
for you, Lothos.

54:23.844 --> 54:25.470
That's too bad.

54:26.555 --> 54:28.431
I had such high hopes.

54:28.933 --> 54:30.516
Close your eyes.

54:32.937 --> 54:33.978
No!

54:34.063 --> 54:35.521
Not this one!

54:36.982 --> 54:38.191
Lothos.

54:39.026 --> 54:40.652
[Grunts]

54:40.736 --> 54:42.153
[Groans]

54:45.908 --> 54:47.450
Ashes to ashes.

54:51.872 --> 54:53.581
[Gurgles]

54:55.459 --> 54:56.709
Oh, look.

54:57.002 --> 54:58.878
Look what I've done.

55:00.047 --> 55:01.839
Aw. [Sobs]

55:02.091 --> 55:03.549
Dust to dust.

55:04.885 --> 55:06.386
We're leaving.

55:06.679 --> 55:09.055
We're not eating?
She's not ready.

55:10.099 --> 55:11.432
[Groaning]

55:11.767 --> 55:16.187
Oh.
Stay still.

55:16.271 --> 55:17.647
I am still.

55:18.399 --> 55:20.483
[Groans]
I'll get some help.

55:20.567 --> 55:21.901
[Coughs]

55:25.948 --> 55:27.115
You...

55:28.492 --> 55:33.413
You do everything wrong.
[Chuckles]

55:35.499 --> 55:37.000
Sorry.
No.

55:37.084 --> 55:39.419
I take it back.
[Chuckling]
No.

55:41.171 --> 55:42.588
Do it wrong.

55:43.674 --> 55:46.843
Don't play our game.

55:48.095 --> 55:50.763
Lothos is a...

55:52.099 --> 55:53.433
is a show.

55:54.601 --> 55:56.602
Remember
about the music.

55:57.271 --> 55:58.438
Listen.

56:00.190 --> 56:03.276
When the music stops,

56:05.070 --> 56:06.571
the rest is...

56:10.451 --> 56:11.701
Merrick?

56:12.578 --> 56:13.786
Merrick!

56:14.955 --> 56:16.039
Oh.

57:02.628 --> 57:06.214
It really was mondo bizarro.
Oh, please.

57:06.298 --> 57:08.549
When she ran out
into the court in the
middle of the game,

57:08.634 --> 57:10.551
wasn't it the most
out-of-it thing ever,
or did I blink?

57:10.636 --> 57:12.720
No. Way mental.

57:15.682 --> 57:18.101
Oh, hi, Buffy.
Hi, guys.

57:18.685 --> 57:21.187
You were supposed
to be here at 3:00.

57:21.855 --> 57:23.898
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

57:23.982 --> 57:25.942
Buffy, what
is your sitch?

57:26.026 --> 57:28.027
You're acting like
the thing from another
tax bracket.

57:28.112 --> 57:29.362
It's too weird.

57:29.446 --> 57:32.240
Listen, a lot's been
going on, guys, okay?

57:32.533 --> 57:35.118
And I really wanted
to talk to you
guys about it.

57:37.788 --> 57:39.122
See, um...

57:40.207 --> 57:42.416
A couple of weeks ago
I met this guy.

57:42.543 --> 57:45.128
Oh, my God.
You're having an affair?

57:45.212 --> 57:47.255
Cool!
Does Jeffrey know?

57:49.133 --> 57:50.883
It's not about that.

57:51.218 --> 57:53.261
He's, like, old. He's 50.

57:54.054 --> 57:55.638
[Together]
Ew!

57:56.140 --> 57:57.598
Sick!
[Jennifer]
Gross!

57:57.683 --> 58:01.477
Haven't you guys noticed
what's been going on here?

58:01.562 --> 58:02.728
The strange things?

58:03.272 --> 58:07.233
Haven't you noticed
people disappearing,
turning up dead?

58:07.401 --> 58:08.943
What are you
talking about?

58:09.027 --> 58:12.321
Weird? You mean
like hanging out
with that homeless Poke?

58:13.448 --> 58:14.574
Pike.

58:15.284 --> 58:16.576
[Gasps]

58:16.994 --> 58:19.495
Ew! You're having
an affair with him?

58:19.580 --> 58:21.205
He doesn't look 50.

58:21.290 --> 58:23.291
Guys, I think reality
stepped out of here

58:23.417 --> 58:26.711
about five minutes ago.
[Kimberly]
Oh, thank you very much.

58:26.795 --> 58:29.881
Yeah, like you've
got a grip.
You're so out of it.

58:29.965 --> 58:32.967
Jennifer says you've
blown off cheerleading
and now dance committee?

58:33.051 --> 58:35.636
Excuse me for having
something important to do.

58:35.971 --> 58:38.139
And this
isn't important?

58:38.223 --> 58:39.974
This happens
to be the dance.

58:40.058 --> 58:41.976
[Buffy]
Right. It's a dance.

58:42.060 --> 58:46.230
It's a stupid dance
with a bunch of stupid people
that I see every stupid day.

58:46.440 --> 58:49.442
[Scoffs]
Like, now we're,
like, stupid?

58:49.526 --> 58:52.862
You know, Buffy,
this doesn't happen
to be just any dance.

58:52.946 --> 58:56.115
It happens to be
the last dance
of our last year.

58:56.450 --> 58:58.034
Except for the semiformal.

58:58.118 --> 58:59.869
Right.
Oh, and the totally formal.

59:00.204 --> 59:02.830
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Oh, yeah, and the senior prom.

59:02.915 --> 59:07.001
Okay! Look, Buffy,
if you wanna play house
with the unwashed masses,

59:07.085 --> 59:09.212
that's fine,
but personally,

59:09.296 --> 59:11.589
I think you should
spend a little
time prioritizing.

59:11.715 --> 59:14.467
I really do.
Yeah, what language
are you speaking?

59:14.801 --> 59:16.552
Get out of my facial.

59:21.016 --> 59:22.433
[Nicole]
Well...
[Scoffs]

59:22.517 --> 59:24.560
I guess you got
what you came for.

59:26.271 --> 59:28.731
Nic.
[Nicole]
Later for it.

59:28.815 --> 59:30.399
[Departing Footsteps]

59:31.151 --> 59:32.193
Jen.

59:45.999 --> 59:47.166
Buff!

59:49.002 --> 59:51.087
Hey, Buff, whatcha
been doing? I've been
looking all over for you.

59:51.171 --> 59:53.798
I'm going shopping.
Don't try and
stop me, okay?

59:53.882 --> 59:56.300
Cool. I need
some Allen wrenches.
What do you need?

59:56.385 --> 59:58.177
Dress.
For what?

59:58.595 --> 01:00:00.680
Dance.
Come again?

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:03.140
I'm going
to the senior dance.

01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:05.685
Second word
sounds like "dance."

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:09.689
I'm going to the dance.
For what?

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.942
In order to dance,
drink punch,
be with my friends.

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:15.278
Â¿ Comprende?
No, I don't comprende.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:18.322
Here the world is under attack
by legions of the undead...

01:00:18.407 --> 01:00:21.993
You're going to a mixer.
It's not a mixer.
It's a senior dance.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:24.954
It's important.
You wouldn't understand.
No, I wouldn't understand!

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:26.622
I thought you wanted
to kill vampires.

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:29.000
I don't want
to kill anybody.

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:31.168
I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:35.381
What about Merrick?
Is that what he'd want?
Merrick's dead.

01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:37.300
Cheap shot.

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:39.885
He's dead because of me.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:42.388
Because I couldn't
lift a hand
against Lothos.

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:45.141
I'm in way over my head.

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:46.809
Look, life's a bitch.
I'll give you that.

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:49.228
But, Buffy, you're the guy.

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:52.690
You are the chosen guy.
Right.

01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:56.360
I'm the Chosen One,
and I choose
to be shopping.

01:00:57.237 --> 01:00:59.238
Yeah, I should have known.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.282
Just leave me alone,
all right?

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.286
You know, Benny was right.
You're all the same.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.663
I'm not disappointed,
just angry!

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:14.295
[Tires Squeal]

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:19.091
[Shutter Clicks]

01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:23.929
Buffy?
[Laughs]

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:28.476
[Sighs]

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:30.770
[Whirring]

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:34.815
Buffy.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:36.776
Lay out my suit.

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:40.821
We will be
attending a dance.
Dance?

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:42.990
Master, what are
we waiting for?

01:01:43.075 --> 01:01:45.826
The Slayer is unmasked.
Let's finish it.

01:01:46.828 --> 01:01:49.121
We'll wait until Saturday.
Why?

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.749
Because I...
[Chuckles]

01:01:53.085 --> 01:01:54.585
Want to dance.

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.463
[Rock]
I'm yours to command.

01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:01.217
[Laughs]
[Laughs]

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:04.845
[Man]
I'm taking you
to the silent city

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.055
[Laughter Continues]

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:09.517
Underneath
the broken stones

01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:13.646
I was hoping for eternity

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.817
Here among the dirt
and bones

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:23.531
You lovers hand in hand

01:02:25.534 --> 01:02:31.705
Enjoy your time together
while you can

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:35.251
Ow.
[Whistles]

01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:44.927
[Ends]

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:48.681
[Chattering, Whooping]
[Techno Dance]

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.371
[Laughing]
Nice outfit.

01:03:13.582 --> 01:03:16.542
This one doesn't have
a mirror at home.
Shh! [Laughs]

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:32.975
Have you seen Jeffrey?

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:35.269
If I say no,
are you gonna hurt me?

01:03:36.188 --> 01:03:38.564
No.
No.

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:45.070
Shh!

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:47.573
Hi, guys.
Hi.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.576
Have you seen Jeffrey?

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.578
'Cause, uh, the limo
didn't show up,

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:55.289
and I thought
maybe he'd be here.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:03:58.918
What?

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:00.461
[Laughing]

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:05.758
Jeffrey, there you are.
Buffy, what are
you doin' here?

01:04:05.926 --> 01:04:09.261
I thought we were
gonna come here together.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:11.430
I'm here with Jenny.

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:12.932
[Giggling]

01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:15.976
I don't get it.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.354
Come on, Buff.
You know what's going on.

01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:20.022
It's not working out at all.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.525
Gotta move on.

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:24.235
I got needs too.

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:26.612
I told you
about all this.

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:30.991
No, you didn't.
Didn't you get
my message?

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:34.954
You left me a message?
You weren't home,
like always.

01:04:35.247 --> 01:04:37.373
You broke up with my machine?

01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:39.083
I'm outta here. Jenny!

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:41.961
[Snaps Fingers]
Jenny! We're leavin'.

01:04:47.968 --> 01:04:49.718
[Rock Ballad]

01:05:00.355 --> 01:05:01.855
[Man]
Opened my eyes

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:05.985
Fire had come

01:05:08.113 --> 01:05:12.324
Not for the end of days

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:16.036
Not for the faithless ones

01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:21.125
Not for vision understood

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:25.212
Burns because
it has to burn

01:05:25.297 --> 01:05:27.172
Change will happen

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:28.841
Whether we

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:33.262
Are still or moving

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:35.014
[Vocalizing]

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:42.187
Breathe in waves of doubt

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:49.486
Bitter in your mouth

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:57.036
You will exhale
cinnamon clouds

01:05:58.538 --> 01:06:00.372
[Gasps]
God. Pike.
[Laughs]

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:03.042
I, uh...
I crashed your party.

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:05.252
How shallow of you.

01:06:05.337 --> 01:06:07.713
Yeah, well, I'm...
I'm pretty shallow.

01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:11.592
I'm glad you came.

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:13.594
Well, you seem
to be having a swell time,

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:17.181
you know, the queen
of the cardboard jungle.

01:06:22.354 --> 01:06:25.564
Would I get my ass kicked
if I asked you to dance?

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:28.400
Drown in waves of doubt

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:29.735
Maybe.

01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:36.909
Touch me inside out

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:41.246
And I will exhale

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:44.375
A primal shout

01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:52.341
You know, Buffy,
you're not like other girls.

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:58.263
Yes, I am.

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:01.225
And I understand

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:49.826
Wow.

01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:52.704
Did I do all of that?

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:55.540
No.

01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:58.042
[Sighs]
Did you do all of that?

01:19:58.711 --> 01:20:00.462
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:02.046
[Boy]
She's way out there,
man.

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:05.467
[Girl]
I don't know.
I think she's kind of cool.

01:20:11.182 --> 01:20:12.390
I, uh...

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:14.851
I saved you a dance.

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:20.148
You gonna ask me?

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:26.946
[Siren Blaring]

01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:28.740
I suppose you wanna lead.

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:29.866
No.

01:20:33.454 --> 01:20:34.829
Me neither.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.292
This is a good thing.

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:48.593
[Rock: Mid-tempo]

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:12.617
[Engine Starts]
[Woman]
Close our eyes

01:21:16.622 --> 01:21:18.790
Close our eyes and dream

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.795
And the world
has turned around again
[Buffy Laughs]

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:26.756
Oh, oh

01:21:30.678 --> 01:21:33.346
When everybody

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:36.683
Is running
in the big race

01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:40.311
And havin' a good time

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:44.732
Who am I to cast a shadow?

01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:46.651
Who am I?

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:50.280
I looked death in the face
last night

01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:51.614
I saw him...

01:21:51.699 --> 01:21:53.866
...and laid siege,
if you will,

01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:55.702
to the Hemery senior dance.

01:21:55.786 --> 01:21:58.580
They had fangs.
They were biting people.

01:21:58.789 --> 01:22:01.332
They had this
look in their eyes.

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:02.917
Totally cold. Animal.

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:05.878
I think they were
Young Republicans.

01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:08.089
It was like a nightmare
in there.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:09.966
Of course,
I had to keep my head.

01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:12.468
But I've been there,
you know.

01:22:13.721 --> 01:22:16.139
Yeah, I saw a lot of action
in Nam.

01:22:17.641 --> 01:22:20.101
Well, I saw Platoon.

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:24.731
I'm very happy
to accept this honor,

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:28.443
and I will try very hard
to fulfill my needs

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.278
as your next Miss America.

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:34.866
I do think the students
learned a valuable lesson
about safety.

01:22:36.035 --> 01:22:37.952
Except the dead ones, I mean.
Of course.

01:22:38.037 --> 01:22:40.038
Well, they learned it.
[Chuckles]

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:41.706
But they really...

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:45.126
They really didn't have time
to implement it, you know,
and...

01:22:45.878 --> 01:22:47.545
I... Are we live?

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:50.506
I felt something was wrong,

01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:53.426
so we really got out of there
before...

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:56.846
I mean, I heard stuff.
We were nearby
when we heard...

01:22:56.930 --> 01:23:00.224
[Sobbing]
I can't believe I let you
do that to me!

01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:06.648
Details are still sketchy

01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:09.776
as to exactly who
is responsible,

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.611
gang members, cultists.

01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:14.489
Everyone seemed to see
something different.

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:17.950
This is Liz Smith
in Los Angeles.

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:25.583
[Groaning, Moaning]

01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:30.963

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:38.930
[Chorus]
Yeah

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:42.392
[Woman]
I admit you got
the biggest brown eyes

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:46.688
And you know
how to bite your lips
to tantalize

01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:51.109
Sure
Yeah

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:55.822
You can get any girl
you want goin'
and you do it

01:23:55.906 --> 01:23:59.367
And don't say
you don't know,
'cause you do

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.748
Well, baby, I ain't gonna
eat out my heart anymore

01:24:05.999 --> 01:24:10.211
I ain't gonna
eat out my heart anymore

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:14.257
I ain't gonna eat out
my heart anymore

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:16.092
So quit it

01:24:19.638 --> 01:24:22.724
I love you, I love you
I do, boy

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:26.894
But you ain't gonna
cheat on me

01:24:27.771 --> 01:24:30.940
I need you, I need you
I do, boy

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:38.781
Choose
Is it her or me?

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:42.660
Yeah

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:47.123
Just 'cause
I have a say input

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:52.545
You should be ashamed
of what I've been seeing

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:55.256
Damn
Yeah

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:59.093
You better watch your step
or, boy, you're gonna lose

01:24:59.678 --> 01:25:03.848
The best thing
you ever had

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:05.975
Oh, oh

01:25:06.059 --> 01:25:10.396
Now he ain't gonna eat out
my heart anymore

01:25:10.481 --> 01:25:14.192
I ain't gonna
eat out my heart anymore

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:18.237
I ain't gonna eat out
my heart anymore

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:19.989
So quit it

01:25:21.033 --> 01:25:22.492
Oh, whoa

01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:26.412
I ain't gonna eat out
my heart anymore

01:25:26.497 --> 01:25:28.706
I ain't gonna eat out
my heart
