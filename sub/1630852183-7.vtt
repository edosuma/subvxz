WEBVTT

00:12.263 --> 00:15.266
[Camille] No one knows
exactly who coined the term

00:15.266 --> 00:17.268
"strong Black woman"

00:17.268 --> 00:19.729
or even exactly
when the term originated.

00:19.729 --> 00:23.482
What we do know is the trope
is uniquely American

00:23.482 --> 00:26.861
and has been germane from
slavery to the present day.

00:26.861 --> 00:29.155
In comparison
to white femininity,

00:29.155 --> 00:30.656
which is valued for beauty,

00:30.656 --> 00:31.824
vulnerability,

00:31.824 --> 00:33.409
and maternal softness,

00:33.409 --> 00:36.370
Black women have been
valued for their labor,

00:36.370 --> 00:39.665
both literally
and figuratively.

00:39.665 --> 00:43.085
A strong Black woman
suppresses her emotions,

00:43.085 --> 00:44.795
never letting anyone
see her sweat.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.338
She is ambitious,

00:46.338 --> 00:48.090
but still makes time
to be supportive,

00:48.090 --> 00:51.051
even carrying her mate,
her friends,

00:51.051 --> 00:53.304
and her family when necessary.

00:53.304 --> 00:56.182
Being labeled
a strong Black woman

00:56.182 --> 00:58.392
is a rite of passage.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.561
She is resilient, independent,

01:00.561 --> 01:02.313
and capable.

01:02.313 --> 01:04.064
[sighs]

01:04.064 --> 01:05.608
But what if she isn't?

01:05.608 --> 01:08.986
It's been four fucking hours
since the doctor has been here.

01:08.986 --> 01:11.197
Do you know what I could do
in four hours?

01:11.197 --> 01:12.740
We could have binge-watched
Roots by now.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.700
- You ever seen Roots?
- Mm-mm.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.285
Not even a remake with T.I.?

01:16.285 --> 01:17.369
Definitely not.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.580
Tch, Black people kill me
not Blacking.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.081
You seen it?

01:21.081 --> 01:23.292
Nah, but it's still on my DVR.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.960
- [both laugh]
- Bitch.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.087
Oh, fuck.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.006
Yo, whatever it is,

01:29.006 --> 01:31.050
it needs to happen quick.

01:31.050 --> 01:33.093
I have my flight to AfroTech
in the morning.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.346
You are not getting on
a plane in this condition.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.264
Oh, I am not missing AfroTech.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.809
It is the Mecca
for Black techies.

01:39.809 --> 01:42.603
And there's gonna be mad,
blerd chicks to holla at,

01:42.603 --> 01:43.771
and did we forget...

01:43.771 --> 01:45.689
[both] Your girl
is a keynote speaker.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.275
Mm-hmm, but if you do not
make your health your focus,

01:48.275 --> 01:50.694
I'm gonna be the keynote
speaker at your funeral.

01:50.694 --> 01:53.197
See, this is why I don't
tell people when I'm sick,

01:53.197 --> 01:54.365
because it becomes a thing.

01:54.365 --> 01:55.699
And then the next thing
you know,

01:55.699 --> 01:57.409
everybody's acting like
you got six weeks to live

01:57.409 --> 01:58.869
when it's just
a damn runny nose.

01:58.869 --> 02:01.664
A runny nose does not
cause you to pass out

02:01.664 --> 02:03.749
on a disgusting subway floor.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.459
By the way, we should probably
have them check you

02:05.459 --> 02:09.088
for hepatitis A and B and C.

02:09.088 --> 02:10.881
- Is there a D?
- Whatever.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.675
My point is,
I don't like to be treated

02:12.675 --> 02:14.343
like I'm weak sauce.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.345
Or petted like a damn dog.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.805
Quinn, you didn't
tell anybody, did you?

02:17.805 --> 02:19.849
Oh, my God, for the
millionth time, I didn't.

02:19.849 --> 02:21.934
Good, I don't need
Camille in here

02:21.934 --> 02:23.143
tracing stomach pain

02:23.143 --> 02:25.855
back to the Middle Passage
or some shit.

02:25.855 --> 02:27.064
And Angie would be up in here

02:27.064 --> 02:29.650
stealing hospital supplies
as reparations.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.778
Oh, God, the doctor said
he would be right back.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.446
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

02:34.446 --> 02:36.949
See, this is why my family
doesn't fuck with doctors.

02:36.949 --> 02:38.659
They don't treat us anyway.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.953
The most they do
is experiment like Tuskegee.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.997
- The Relf Sisters.
- Mississippi Appendectomy.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.373
- Henrietta Lacks.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.000
Well, hello, dear.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.668
So you're anemic.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.711
Let's get you
a blood transfusion,

02:48.711 --> 02:50.087
get your numbers back up.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.464
Okay, and what about
her back and her pelvic pain?

02:52.464 --> 02:55.384
Ah, that's just Aunt Flo
being a tough houseguest.

02:55.384 --> 02:56.760
When your cycle's over
in a few days,

02:56.760 --> 02:58.512
the pain will subside.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.639
What if it's been
more than a few days?

03:00.639 --> 03:02.892
I've been on my period
for 11 days now.

03:02.892 --> 03:04.101
What?

03:04.101 --> 03:05.352
[Doctor] Well,
every woman is different.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.605
Well, as a woman,
I would say that 11 days

03:07.605 --> 03:09.273
deserves a far more
aggressive approach

03:09.273 --> 03:10.900
to her diagnosis than Aunt Flo.

03:10.900 --> 03:13.861
And the Tylenol ain't
cutting it for the pain.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.654
Ah, so you're here for drugs?

03:15.654 --> 03:18.616
I'm here because I passed out
on a damn subway.

03:18.616 --> 03:20.034
We have a very
strict policy against

03:20.034 --> 03:21.911
prescribing opioids
in this community.

03:21.911 --> 03:24.246
Well, from what I hear,
this community

03:24.246 --> 03:26.081
isn't the one that you need
to be worried about.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.334
Now, my friend
is in serious pain.

03:28.334 --> 03:30.169
You have not done
any ultrasounds,

03:30.169 --> 03:31.670
- Any checks, any...
[Doctor] As a doctor,

03:31.670 --> 03:34.757
I have her bloodwork and that
tells me all I need to know.

03:34.757 --> 03:36.592
Have you tried relaxing,
meditation?

03:36.592 --> 03:38.886
This could all just be
stress in your head.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.555
I'll have the nurse get started
on your blood transfusion.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.598
Ooh.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.391
O negative, universal donor.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.894
You should consider getting on
a regular donation schedule.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.354
A lot of people could
really use your help.

03:48.354 --> 03:50.314
I'm sorry,
did you just tell her

03:50.314 --> 03:52.066
that she needed
a blood transfusion

03:52.066 --> 03:54.151
and then asked for her shit
back in the same breath?

03:54.151 --> 03:56.111
I can see we're a little upset.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.112
I'm gonna go.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.531
The nurse will be by.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.617
We're upset?

04:01.617 --> 04:02.993
Shit.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.828
Thank God you can go home
after this transfusion,

04:04.828 --> 04:07.456
but 11 days, Tye?

04:07.456 --> 04:10.292
Why you ain't tell me?

04:10.292 --> 04:11.919
I don't wanna lose you.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.088
Lose me, Quinn?

04:14.088 --> 04:16.423
Wow.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.385
Wow.
Great work, Camille.

04:19.385 --> 04:21.679
Of course it is, Nora.

04:21.679 --> 04:23.681
And that's "Dr. Parks."

04:23.681 --> 04:26.517
Well, since Dr. Pruitt
asked you to assist me,

04:26.517 --> 04:28.686
I thought we were
more colleagues.

04:28.686 --> 04:31.438
And remind me,
where did you get your PhD?

04:31.438 --> 04:34.108
Like I said, Dr. Parks.
Thanks.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.944
Do you know
a Dr. Amina Reynolds?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.153
I know of her.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.405
Well, I met her earlier today

04:39.405 --> 04:41.865
after she interviewed
with Dr. Pruitt.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.617
She seems really nice.
Who knows?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.787
Maybe next year
I'll get to take her class.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.290
She was interviewing for the
associate professor's position?

04:50.290 --> 04:53.293
Not sure, but probably.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.170
Well, have a good night,
Dr. Parks.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.259
[sighs]

05:00.259 --> 05:01.760
[whispers] Fuck.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.805
[phone ringing]

05:07.599 --> 05:09.643
Hey, hey, hey, beautiful,
I was just about to text you.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.603
I'm thinking Zoma
or Pisticci tonight.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.605
[Camille] I'm sorry, babe,
I can't do dinner tonight.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.482
I just found out that
Dr. Pruitt is interviewing

05:15.482 --> 05:17.693
outside candidates for the
associate professor position.

05:17.693 --> 05:19.153
[Jameson]
For tenure track?

05:19.153 --> 05:21.697
- I thought that was all you.
[Camille] So did I.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.867
Now, I need to update my CV,
gather my materials,

05:24.867 --> 05:26.076
and compose
my mission statement

05:26.076 --> 05:28.370
to present it to Dr. Pruitt,
like, yesterday,

05:28.370 --> 05:29.830
and you know
it's gotta be tight.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.248
[Jameson] And it will be.
Look, you got this.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.042
And if, you know,
if we have time,

05:33.042 --> 05:34.460
we can meet up later
for a nightcap.

05:34.460 --> 05:37.004
Okay, wait, you wanna hear
something funny?

05:37.004 --> 05:39.590
So in middle school,
I used to think that

05:39.590 --> 05:42.718
nightcap was slang for condom

05:42.718 --> 05:45.095
'cause you put it, like,
on your head, get it?

05:45.095 --> 05:48.265
I do get it, um, but don't
tell anybody else that.

05:48.265 --> 05:51.435
- [line beeps]
- Hold on.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.395
Oh, shit, um,
I need to get this.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.105
It's my therapist,
but I will see you later.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.524
[Jameson] All right.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.485
Rebecca, hi.

05:59.485 --> 06:01.737
I am so sorry that I missed
our session earlier.

06:01.737 --> 06:02.988
I got caught up at work and...

06:02.988 --> 06:04.198
[Rebecca]
This is the third session

06:04.198 --> 06:05.824
- you've missed this month.
- Yeah.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.659
[Rebecca] If you don't wish
to continue your therapy...

06:07.659 --> 06:10.162
No, no, no.
I do, I do.

06:10.162 --> 06:12.289
Do you have anything tomorrow?
Please?

06:12.289 --> 06:15.417
I will work with
whatever you have available.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.960
[Rebecca]30.
- Okay.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.464
30.
I will be there.

06:20.464 --> 06:23.467
Yes.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.843
[quietly]
Yes, okay.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.261
[mellow music]

06:26.261 --> 06:28.847
[exhales]
Mission statement.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.307
[exhales]

06:30.307 --> 06:32.976
[singer]

07:34.037 --> 07:36.832
[upbeat piano melody]

07:57.102 --> 07:58.770
Yeah, pretty much
from the age of six,

07:58.770 --> 08:01.106
I could tell you that the
traffic light and peanut butter

08:01.106 --> 08:03.025
were both invented
by Black men.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.777
Also how about
that Harriet Tubman?

09:29.194 --> 09:30.570
[all] Yeah!

09:30.570 --> 09:31.780
Ugh, seriously?

09:31.780 --> 09:34.449
[Mark] And, scene.
Kate, you okay?

09:34.449 --> 09:36.034
This marking tape
is so ghetto.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.369
It's like barely
stuck to the floor.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.162
[Mark] Hey, okay.
We'll take care of it.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.872
No, Mark.
It's not just the tape.

09:40.872 --> 09:43.125
Like, what is up with
this whole ghetto set design?

09:43.125 --> 09:45.002
Is she pronouncing
"Get Out" weird,

09:45.002 --> 09:46.586
or calling everything ghetto?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.672
Kate, to be honest, you were
a little late on your mark.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.633
Yeah, no shit, Mark,
but how am I supposed to tell?

09:51.633 --> 09:53.260
I'm so over this
ghetto production.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.554
Kay, why do you keep
saying "ghetto?"

09:55.554 --> 09:58.307
- What?
- You keep saying "ghetto."

09:58.307 --> 10:01.059
- What do you mean by that?
- [laughs]

10:01.059 --> 10:02.769
Are you calling me racist?

10:02.769 --> 10:05.772
Depends on how you answer
the question.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.232
[scoffs]

10:07.232 --> 10:09.818
- Oh, my God.
- White girls gonna white.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.236
Mark, can we move on
to a number

10:11.236 --> 10:14.197
featuring those of us
without a ghetto work ethic?

10:14.197 --> 10:15.699
- Kate!
- Good.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.367
Those of us
in the "Sunken Place" number,

10:17.367 --> 10:18.535
front and center.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.871
Ain't nobody got time
for that today.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.626
[grunts]
Mm.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.961
This is the second time
I've stayed the night

10:27.961 --> 10:29.379
at your house,

10:29.379 --> 10:33.300
and the second time you've
stayed up all night working.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.135
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.304
There's just never enough time
to get everything done,

10:37.304 --> 10:39.639
but I promise
that I will make time for us.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.016
Don't apologize.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.684
Most people just
talk about going hard,

10:42.684 --> 10:45.228
but you, you actually do it.
[laughs]

10:45.228 --> 10:48.315
Yeah, well,
while y'all sleep, I grind.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.941
I love that.

10:49.941 --> 10:53.695
Yeah, but even the grind
can't outrun time.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.614
I think I'm gonna have
to cancel my class so that

10:55.614 --> 10:57.574
I can get everything done for
this meeting with Dr. Pruitt.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.410
Cancel your class? You might
as well cancel your tenure.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.453
Cam, how are you going to show

11:01.453 --> 11:02.996
you can be
a tenure track professor

11:02.996 --> 11:04.956
if you cancel class every time
you need a few extra minutes?

11:04.956 --> 11:06.666
Damn, you're right.
You're right.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.585
I know it's tough.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.922
But remember pressure is
what turns coal into diamonds,

11:11.922 --> 11:14.716
and you, my dear,
are a diamond.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.676
You know, I'm so used
to the men in my life

11:16.676 --> 11:20.138
always saying that I take
everything so seriously.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.723
It's kind of dope
having someone

11:21.723 --> 11:23.767
that pushes me to be my best.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.685
I mean, come on,
as the great poets once said,

11:25.685 --> 11:28.688
"You and I gots to do
for you and I."

11:28.688 --> 11:30.107
Exactly.

11:30.107 --> 11:32.901
[singer]

11:32.901 --> 11:34.444
[upbeat music]

11:34.444 --> 11:35.695
[Quinn]
Hey, Mom.

11:35.695 --> 11:39.199
I need you to take in
this dress 2 inches.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.201
Three weeks on keto.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.620
- You look good.
- I look outstanding.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.997
Maybe you should try keto.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.374
Mm.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.917
Busy as usual.

11:48.917 --> 11:53.338
Actually,
I am designing a wedding dress.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.966
For $25,000.

11:55.966 --> 11:59.469
[Patricia]
I love this color, lilac.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.555
And she's recommending me
to all of her friends.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.932
[Patricia] What you call
that pink color?

12:03.932 --> 12:05.392
- "Mohv"?
- Mauve.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.894
And after getting the deposit,

12:07.894 --> 12:09.771
the store is officially
in the black

12:09.771 --> 12:11.815
for the very first time.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.650
[gasps]

12:13.650 --> 12:16.987
I think you're gonna have
to come in 3 inches.

12:16.987 --> 12:19.823
Oh, keto, where have you been
all my life?

12:19.823 --> 12:22.951
Uh, Mom, did you hear
what I just said?

12:22.951 --> 12:24.327
Yes, but talk to me

12:24.327 --> 12:26.163
when you can go
more than 30 days

12:26.163 --> 12:29.124
without asking me and your
father to keep the lights on.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.835
Mom, all businesses operate
at a deficit in the beginning.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.587
But yours remain there--

12:33.587 --> 12:35.380
the juice bar, the spa.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.174
Well, this is different.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.342
This is what I was supposed
to be doing all along.

12:39.342 --> 12:42.762
Mom, I've been trying
really hard to turn a profit.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.639
The least you could do
is acknowledge that.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.475
Acknowledged.

12:46.475 --> 12:49.186
And you should acknowledge
that one wedding dress

12:49.186 --> 12:51.938
does not
a successful business make.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.899
What size do you think
I am now?

12:53.899 --> 12:55.734
I don't know.
Six?

12:55.734 --> 12:59.529
I am 10 cauliflower pizzas
away from a four.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.908
Then you'll be my size.

13:02.908 --> 13:05.660
Interesting, considering

13:05.660 --> 13:08.079
I have had two children.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.962
[singer]

13:24.471 --> 13:25.805
[clears throat]

13:28.183 --> 13:30.644
Kate is asking
for a little more time

13:30.644 --> 13:32.062
before she can rehearse.

13:32.062 --> 13:35.273
See, this that 53% of white
women bullshit right here.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.566
We better still
get paid for this.

13:36.566 --> 13:39.528
- Okay?
- I want us all to remember

13:39.528 --> 13:42.239
that we are a family
when we're all on this stage.

13:42.239 --> 13:45.158
When one of us makes an
insensitive comment to another,

13:45.158 --> 13:46.701
it hurts the production
as a whole.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.620
Mm, say that.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.413
We have to be careful
with our words.

13:50.413 --> 13:53.750
That's right.
Watch your mouths up in here.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.585
...because words can hurt.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.504
I mean, I wasn't really hurt.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.964
More like, "What the fuck?"

13:58.964 --> 14:00.257
But I get what you mean.

14:00.257 --> 14:01.967
Shit wasn't cool.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.385
- Angie.
- I ain't like it.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.512
Can I see you for a moment?

14:05.512 --> 14:06.972
Sure.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.683
Okay, good luck.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.895
I need you
to apologize to Kate.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.855
Ex-fucking-scuse me?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.774
She should be apologizing
to me.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.442
Shit, to all of us.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.987
She says something fucked up
nearly every day.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.697
Look, she's really upset

14:23.697 --> 14:24.948
and she won't come back
to rehearsal

14:24.948 --> 14:26.116
until you apologize.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.159
I guess you need to cast
another Rose then.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.829
I know some talented white
girls who know how to act.

14:30.829 --> 14:31.997
You want me to make some calls?

14:31.997 --> 14:34.165
- Angie, come on.
- Why?

14:34.165 --> 14:36.001
Why am I the one
who has to come on?

14:36.001 --> 14:38.670
She over here making
some offensive-ass comments

14:38.670 --> 14:40.213
and somehow she's the victim.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.965
Come the fuck on
with that shit.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.384
Angie, you basically said
that she was racist,

14:44.384 --> 14:45.594
and we both know
that isn't true.

14:45.594 --> 14:48.054
One, if it looks like
a microaggression

14:48.054 --> 14:49.472
and talks like
a microaggression,

14:49.472 --> 14:51.600
then it's fucking racism.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.768
Two, nigga, who is "we?"

14:53.768 --> 14:55.645
You can cape for Kate
all you want to,

14:55.645 --> 14:56.938
but leave me
the fuck out of it.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.107
Angie, you know,
I feel you, girl,

14:59.107 --> 15:01.985
but sometimes you gotta
be Michelle Obama

15:01.985 --> 15:03.653
and go high when they go low.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.196
When they go low,
I go basements.

15:05.196 --> 15:06.740
She's ignorant, Angie,

15:06.740 --> 15:08.241
and we have to teach
ignorant people.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.161
I am tired of niggas
forgiving racist shit.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.871
To what end?

15:12.871 --> 15:14.623
'Cause racist motherfuckers
ain't sorry.

15:14.623 --> 15:17.667
Okay, obviously, tensions
are running a bit high.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.837
I think we could all use
a break to cool off.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.422
Let's reconvene after lunch!

15:22.422 --> 15:23.840
Wait, till my girls
hear about this shit.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.925
If she can knock it over,
I can knock it over, too.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.427
Equality, bitch!

15:31.181 --> 15:32.474
Come in.

15:34.476 --> 15:35.810
You're early.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.437
How refreshing for you?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.356
Well, I told you
that I am usually on time.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.940
What can I do for you?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.651
Well, prior to you
taking over

15:42.651 --> 15:44.778
as chair of the department,
which, may I add,

15:44.778 --> 15:46.446
I think is the best decision...

15:46.446 --> 15:49.407
Camille, less brownnosing.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.992
Right, um,

15:50.992 --> 15:53.745
so when Dr. Goodman
was the chair,

15:53.745 --> 15:55.538
she was planning to endorse me

15:55.538 --> 15:57.248
for the associate professor
position.

15:57.248 --> 16:00.502
And so I just wanted
to request your support.

16:00.502 --> 16:02.837
Here's a copy of my CV,

16:02.837 --> 16:04.714
my transcripts
from undergraduate

16:04.714 --> 16:05.715
through doctorate.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.217
Here's all
my published articles,

16:07.217 --> 16:08.343
and my mission statement.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.678
And this is a presentation

16:09.678 --> 16:12.472
highlighting
my social media presence.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.225
And I know that we initially
got off on the wrong foot,

16:15.225 --> 16:16.851
which is 100% my fault.

16:16.851 --> 16:19.938
I just wanted you to know why
I am perfect for this job.

16:19.938 --> 16:22.315
No.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.566
What?

16:23.566 --> 16:25.276
No.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.445
I will not endorse you
for this job.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.075
Okay.

16:36.246 --> 16:40.750
Camille, aren't you the least
bit curious as to why not?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.711
I just don't think
you're ready.

16:42.711 --> 16:45.547
Well, Robin thought
I was ready.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.382
Matter of fact,
she thought I was great.

16:47.382 --> 16:50.885
Yes, well, a seven shines
in a room of fives.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.887
Doesn't make her a ten.

16:52.887 --> 16:56.725
This is the Ivy league,
and we're Black women.

16:56.725 --> 16:59.310
There's not
that many chances for us.

16:59.310 --> 17:02.021
So if you should fuck this up,

17:02.021 --> 17:04.941
it's gonna reflect badly
on not just us,

17:04.941 --> 17:06.776
but everybody behind us.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.445
Yeah, but what if
I don't fuck this up?

17:08.445 --> 17:10.697
I'm not willing
to take that chance.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.743
But it's...

17:14.743 --> 17:16.161
that's it?

17:18.163 --> 17:19.873
It's just over?

17:19.873 --> 17:22.625
Look, Camille, I really do

17:22.625 --> 17:24.544
want you to succeed.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.546
I think it's great
that you have

17:26.546 --> 17:28.965
a presence on social media.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.718
And I think it's great
that all of your classes

17:31.718 --> 17:33.178
have waitlists,

17:33.178 --> 17:35.513
but your field work is lacking.

17:35.513 --> 17:40.101
You have the minimum amount
of research possible.

17:40.101 --> 17:44.272
Now, you have articles
in popular publications,

17:44.272 --> 17:46.775
but only two
in academic journals.

17:46.775 --> 17:50.570
So if I was going
to endorse someone,

17:50.570 --> 17:52.113
I would endorse somebody

17:52.113 --> 17:54.199
who I knew could swim
with the sharks.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.910
And everything I saw
that you've done

17:56.910 --> 18:00.997
tells me you're barely
swimming with the guppies.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.333
So no, Camille.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.376
You are not ready for this.

18:05.376 --> 18:08.379
[somber music]

18:11.257 --> 18:13.134
Is there something else,
Camille?

18:13.134 --> 18:14.761
No, there's nothing else.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.890
[Tye] Brad, I just made it
to the airport.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.225
I feel fine.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.352
Listen, make sure
you build my schedule

18:22.352 --> 18:24.020
around the top players
at all times.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.105
I'm talking blue checkmarks,

18:26.105 --> 18:29.484
100,000 followers and up.

18:29.484 --> 18:32.153
Okay, okay, I'll call you
when I get to the gate.

18:32.153 --> 18:33.988
Shit.
Fuck!

18:43.248 --> 18:46.125
117 over 92.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.504
Pretty good, dearie.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.214
Did I miss AfroTech?

18:51.214 --> 18:54.676
I don't know what that is,
but probably.

18:54.676 --> 18:57.387
You had a ruptured
ovarian cyst.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.389
The doctor had to do
an emergency surgery,

18:59.389 --> 19:01.391
but everything went well.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.893
He'll be by to check on you
during his rounds.

19:08.731 --> 19:11.150
Do you know where my phone is?

19:11.150 --> 19:14.279
[percussive music]

19:14.279 --> 19:16.531
[singer]

19:16.531 --> 19:18.032
[Angie]
They got me fucked up.

19:18.032 --> 19:20.660
I hate that
white fragility shit.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.453
I mean, they just always
try to be oppressed.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.080
How do you do it, Cam?

19:24.080 --> 19:25.582
You're the only one out of us

19:25.582 --> 19:27.625
who's managed to work for
somebody else all these years.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.085
Well,
it definitely takes a toll.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.670
Mm, I don't do tolls.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.422
So I should just
half-bake that shit, right?

19:32.422 --> 19:34.883
It's like, "Fuck you, fuck you.
Fuck you!

19:34.883 --> 19:37.468
You're cool. Fuck you.
I'm out," right?

19:37.468 --> 19:40.096
Yeah, but the fact that you're
even asking the question

19:40.096 --> 19:41.264
says that you know the answer.

19:41.264 --> 19:43.224
And yes, it sucks unwashed ass,

19:43.224 --> 19:45.643
but sometimes you have
to apologize to keep your job.

19:45.643 --> 19:48.396
You don't have to mean it.
You just have to say it.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.356
See, this is why I don't like
working for people.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.900
Bitch, you don't like
working period.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.818
[laughs]
She ain't wrong.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.529
Okay, but, Angie,
look at the big picture.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.740
Is blowing all this up
right now

19:58.740 --> 20:01.576
worth sacrificing why you took
this play to begin with?

20:01.576 --> 20:03.828
I know it's just a stupid play

20:03.828 --> 20:06.372
and I would get paid more
working fast food,

20:06.372 --> 20:08.625
but I really do love
getting up every day

20:08.625 --> 20:10.710
to sing professionally.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.421
And I gotta say it, Ang,
you have been happier

20:13.421 --> 20:16.549
in these last few weeks
than I have seen in a while.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.509
Probably since you had
that record deal.

20:18.509 --> 20:21.471
So to get a chance to sing
in a dumbass play,

20:21.471 --> 20:24.349
I gotta eat some shit
that's not even my fault?

20:24.349 --> 20:26.392
Who came up with
this brand of bullshit?

20:26.392 --> 20:28.728
- Welcome to being an adult.
- Exactly.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.022
When you've got bills to pay
and goals to reach,

20:31.022 --> 20:32.440
sometimes you gotta eat shit.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.233
And yeah, that shit
is not fucking fair

20:34.233 --> 20:35.443
and nobody
has your fucking back

20:35.443 --> 20:37.070
and it is all the way
fucked up.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.488
Ain't that the truth.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.282
I mean, I just hate having
to ask my mom for money.

20:41.282 --> 20:44.077
I mean, she's always throwing
that shit back in my face.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.453
Girl, I wish asking
my mom for money

20:45.453 --> 20:46.746
was my biggest problem.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.332
Hell, I wish my mom
even had money to loan me.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.459
No, it's bigger than the money
because it's...

20:51.459 --> 20:52.794
And you know how
I was supposed to be

20:52.794 --> 20:54.796
getting that promotion
to associate professor?

20:54.796 --> 20:56.589
Yes, girl, give me good news.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.217
- Not happening.
- What? Why?

20:59.217 --> 21:00.551
Evidently, as a Black woman,

21:00.551 --> 21:02.553
I have to come out the gate
already as the best.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.555
Meanwhile, there's
white boys walking around

21:04.555 --> 21:06.849
with half my resume
who already have tenure.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.267
I just don't understand

21:08.267 --> 21:10.019
why can't I grow into the role
like everyone else?

21:10.019 --> 21:12.730
See, I've been saying that this
whole Black excellence movement

21:12.730 --> 21:14.190
was a tool of oppression,

21:14.190 --> 21:15.566
but y'all don't listen
to Angie.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.820
And yes, yes, okay,
so I had a few missteps,

21:18.820 --> 21:22.031
but now that defines my career,
defines me?

21:22.031 --> 21:23.533
I just don't understand
why someone else

21:23.533 --> 21:25.118
gets to tell me
what I am ready for.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.786
I mean, it's so fucking unfair.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.121
My mom does that same shit
to me.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.539
I can't even...

21:29.539 --> 21:31.582
And it's like, I don't even
understand how everything

21:31.582 --> 21:32.917
went so bad so quick.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.877
It was fine just a month ago.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.547
Now I'm playing second fiddle
to a frigging undergrad.

21:37.547 --> 21:40.091
And my ex is walking around
with his fiancée,

21:40.091 --> 21:41.300
flaunting her in my face.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.052
And no sooner than
I get in a relationship,

21:43.052 --> 21:44.262
he go and text me
talking about,

21:44.262 --> 21:45.805
"Are we making a mistake?"

21:45.805 --> 21:47.557
How the fuck
am I supposed to know?

21:47.557 --> 21:49.600
Breathe, Camille, breathe.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.477
We got you, okay?
You gonna get through this.

21:51.477 --> 21:54.313
Damn, Cam, I wish I had
some answers for you,

21:54.313 --> 21:57.358
but this is some "Iyanla,
Fix My Life" level shit.

21:57.358 --> 21:59.736
You need a professional, babe.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.070
Oh, shit.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.697
Oh, shit.
I'm late for therapy.

22:02.697 --> 22:03.781
Oh, whoa, wait, wait,

22:03.781 --> 22:04.907
I didn't even get
to tell you about my mom

22:04.907 --> 22:06.075
and what she's...

22:06.075 --> 22:07.410
Girl, we all know
Mrs. Pat don't hold back.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.078
I got to go too.
Thanks for lunch.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.706
[somber pop music]

22:14.250 --> 22:16.878
[singer]

22:16.878 --> 22:18.671
Thanks.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.674
[men vocalizing]

22:25.845 --> 22:27.096
I have 10 minutes
left in my session

22:27.096 --> 22:28.639
and I'd like to use it.

22:28.639 --> 22:31.184
I'm surprised to see you.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.144
[clears throat]
I'm sorry that I'm late

22:33.144 --> 22:35.021
and that I missed
my last few appointments.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.814
It's been more than a few,
but who's counting?

22:36.814 --> 22:39.400
- Other than your insurance.
- Right.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.695
It's just work
has just been so crazy

22:42.695 --> 22:44.530
and I had
to sacrifice something.

22:44.530 --> 22:47.325
Have you ever considered
sacrificing work for therapy?

22:47.325 --> 22:48.743
Or do you only take care
of yourself

22:48.743 --> 22:50.078
when your work schedule
permits?

22:50.078 --> 22:53.372
Well, I thought that
I could handle everything.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.665
Tell me about everything.

22:54.665 --> 22:56.250
[sighs]

22:56.250 --> 22:58.169
It's just,

22:58.169 --> 23:00.630
this is not
how I pictured my life.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.715
I thought by now
I'd be a renowned,

23:02.715 --> 23:04.258
tenured anthropologist
that little Black girls

23:04.258 --> 23:05.885
will want to dress like
for Halloween.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.929
I figured that Ian and I
would be married,

23:07.929 --> 23:09.889
living in a single family
brownstone.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.766
And I'd be enjoying two more
years before having kids,

23:11.766 --> 23:13.184
but none of that has happened.

23:13.184 --> 23:15.728
And yes, there's this new guy,
Jameson,

23:15.728 --> 23:18.064
and he's smart and nerdy.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.649
And he really pushes me,
but then Ian,

23:19.649 --> 23:21.025
who I'm finally over--

23:21.025 --> 23:23.152
I'm just helping him
put together his restaurant--

23:23.152 --> 23:26.364
he sends me this text.

23:26.364 --> 23:28.491
"Are we making a mistake?"

23:28.491 --> 23:32.036
That--that is a part
of no plan.

23:32.036 --> 23:33.913
So now I'm just left
with a bunch of confusion,

23:33.913 --> 23:35.623
my edges,
a rent-controlled apartment,

23:35.623 --> 23:37.416
and a bunch
of student loan debt.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.127
When did you come up
with your life plan?

23:39.127 --> 23:41.671
[sighs]
18.

23:41.671 --> 23:44.465
Yeah, my entire adult life
dedicated to a plan

23:44.465 --> 23:46.217
that has fallen
completely apart.

23:46.217 --> 23:48.761
Would you say that you're
the same person you were at 18?

23:48.761 --> 23:50.638
Well, no.

23:50.638 --> 23:51.848
[Rebecca]
So you've changed.

23:51.848 --> 23:55.768
So maybe it's okay
for your plan to change too.

23:55.768 --> 23:56.936
But to what?

23:56.936 --> 23:59.105
To whatever you want.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.149
Or here's an idea:
no plan at all.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.025
Just take life as it comes.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.236
Either you can play the hand
you're dealt

24:05.236 --> 24:06.863
or mourn the one you've lost.

24:06.863 --> 24:10.241
Different doesn't
always mean bad.

24:10.241 --> 24:11.784
[sighs]

24:13.119 --> 24:15.329
You're good.
You should be a therapist.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.582
[chuckles]

24:17.582 --> 24:20.001
You should show up more.

24:20.001 --> 24:21.711
Yeah.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.421
Angie,

24:23.421 --> 24:24.922
you have something
you want to say to Kate?

24:30.094 --> 24:31.971
Yeah, I do.

24:38.728 --> 24:42.023
Fuck you, Kate.

24:42.023 --> 24:44.692
Fuck your microaggressions.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.819
Fuck your white tears
that you use as a weapon

24:46.819 --> 24:49.614
to distract from your racism.

24:49.614 --> 24:51.866
Fuck the history
of white women like you

24:51.866 --> 24:55.203
who got people who look like me
harmed or killed

24:55.203 --> 24:57.163
because you were too weak

24:57.163 --> 25:00.249
to admit your own
fucking shortcomings.

25:00.249 --> 25:02.835
Fuck you for being
another Black man

25:02.835 --> 25:07.089
complicit in some racist
bullshit against a Black woman.

25:07.089 --> 25:11.510
Fuck you for engaging
in respectability politics,

25:11.510 --> 25:17.058
which we all know has never and
will never get us to equality.

25:17.058 --> 25:19.352
You cool, sis.

25:19.352 --> 25:22.980
And fuck you for asking me
to forgive this shit.

25:22.980 --> 25:26.859
Does anybody ask Jewish people
to forgive the Nazis?

25:26.859 --> 25:30.821
No, because the Nazis
were fucking wrong-ass,

25:30.821 --> 25:32.782
vile-ass pieces of shit.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.742
So fuck all y'all!

25:34.742 --> 25:37.954
Fuck this bullshit production!

25:37.954 --> 25:39.580
I'm out!

25:39.580 --> 25:41.749
Angie,

25:41.749 --> 25:44.252
you have something
you want to say to Kate?

25:54.428 --> 25:55.888
Sorry.

25:55.888 --> 25:59.433
Oh, I forgive you.

25:59.433 --> 26:02.687
[sighs]
It's what Buddha would want.

26:02.687 --> 26:03.813
Mm.

26:05.940 --> 26:09.360
See, and that is what
"Get Out" was all about.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.695
No, it wasn't, like, at all.

26:10.695 --> 26:12.113
Did you even see--
you know what?

26:12.113 --> 26:13.739
I got to go.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.574
We still have two hours left.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.452
I've just got a text
and my friend is in a hospital.

26:18.452 --> 26:21.998
[softly] I want this job.
I want this job.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.165
I need this job.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.296
[phone dings]

26:29.422 --> 26:31.007
Oh, shit.

26:31.007 --> 26:34.302
My friend really
is in a hospital.

26:34.302 --> 26:37.888
I have to be more careful
with what I say

26:37.888 --> 26:40.016
or intentional.

26:40.016 --> 26:45.104
My friend is going to be okay.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.481
I have a million dollars.

26:47.481 --> 26:50.693
I have a loyal, rich boyfriend
with a big ass dick.

26:50.693 --> 26:52.862
Ooh, I have a bomb-ass
natural hair wig

26:52.862 --> 26:54.405
made with 4-C human hair.

26:57.575 --> 26:59.660
Tye, I'm so sorry.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.287
I was in therapy.
I just got your message.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.372
Oh, no worries.
It's all good.

27:03.372 --> 27:05.708
You're in a hospital bed.
It is not all good.

27:05.708 --> 27:07.668
I cannot believe
that she needed surgery

27:07.668 --> 27:09.170
when that asshole doctor

27:09.170 --> 27:11.464
wouldn't even give her
a fucking pain pill yesterday.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.132
Yesterday?

27:13.132 --> 27:15.301
[crying]

27:15.301 --> 27:17.720
- No, no, no.
- Oh, damn.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.514
You know it's bad
when Tye is crying.

27:20.514 --> 27:22.350
Never thought I'd see the day.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.601
I'm sorry, y'all.

27:23.601 --> 27:25.811
I'm trying to be strong,
but this shit is scary.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.063
[Quinn]
Oh, honey.

27:27.063 --> 27:29.523
Why you trying to be strong
in a hospital bed?

27:29.523 --> 27:32.234
Yeah, being strong
is so overrated.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.986
- [sobbing]
- Oh.

27:33.986 --> 27:37.156
- [sobs]
[all] Oh, no!

27:37.156 --> 27:38.407
Sorry.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.242
There's just--
there's a lot going on.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.578
Everybody, stop apologizing.

27:42.578 --> 27:44.330
[Tye] Yes.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.582
[crying] Why do we always
have to be the ones

27:46.582 --> 27:50.294
who apologize
when we're hurting?

27:50.294 --> 27:52.546
I am sick of this shit, y'all.

27:52.546 --> 27:55.549
[all sobbing]

27:55.549 --> 27:57.176
Thank you, Quinn.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.053
You're the only one of us
who's not a mess.

27:59.053 --> 28:00.221
[Quinn]
That's not true.

28:00.221 --> 28:01.972
I am a mess.

28:01.972 --> 28:04.016
[all] Oh!

28:04.016 --> 28:07.728
But I'm just not allowed
to talk about it.

28:07.728 --> 28:10.606
Y'all think I'm whining every
time I talk about anything

28:10.606 --> 28:12.900
just because I come from money.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.985
But fuck that money.

28:14.985 --> 28:16.612
That money obviously
couldn't buy me

28:16.612 --> 28:19.490
a decent relationship
with my mom.

28:19.490 --> 28:22.159
And I know it's not the same
as, like, having a surgery

28:22.159 --> 28:23.786
or losing a job

28:23.786 --> 28:26.330
or putting up with white tears,

28:26.330 --> 28:28.749
but it still hurts.

28:28.749 --> 28:30.709
And I don't want to pretend
that it doesn't

28:30.709 --> 28:33.546
just because it doesn't seem
like a big deal to y'all.

28:33.546 --> 28:34.839
No, you don't have to pretend.

28:34.839 --> 28:37.299
- I'm still talking, Camille.
- Sorry.

28:37.299 --> 28:40.177
I will always be here
for you guys,

28:40.177 --> 28:43.013
but maybe check in on me
too sometimes.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.223
Yes.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.349
I'm sorry, Quinn.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.184
I apologize on behalf
of all of them

28:47.184 --> 28:50.187
'cause I always ask
about you, babe.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.356
I'm sorry, Quinn.

28:52.356 --> 28:55.443
You've been by my side
during this whole ordeal.

28:55.443 --> 28:57.570
See, it's like I always say.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.905
"You've got to check in
on your strong friends."

28:59.905 --> 29:02.741
Wait, you didn't make that up.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.743
That's like on 95%
of the internet.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.662
Right, but I always like it
and retweet it,

29:06.662 --> 29:08.038
- so it's the same.
- Oh, gosh, Angie.

29:08.038 --> 29:09.540
No.

29:09.540 --> 29:10.916
- I got you, my baby.
[Tye] Stop it.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.334
What--what are doing?

29:12.334 --> 29:14.253
I am trying to hook you up.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.963
She's in a hospital bed,
Angie.

29:15.963 --> 29:17.548
You ain't got to look like
what you've been through.

29:17.548 --> 29:19.842
- I'm just saying.
- [all chuckle]

29:19.842 --> 29:22.219
[Camille] While the "strong
Black woman" insignia

29:22.219 --> 29:25.139
charades as a compliment,

29:25.139 --> 29:26.974
it really pardons
the rest of the world

29:26.974 --> 29:28.350
of their responsibility

29:28.350 --> 29:31.312
to view the Black woman
as vulnerable,

29:31.312 --> 29:33.522
able to experience pain,

29:33.522 --> 29:35.191
capable of weakness,

29:35.191 --> 29:36.859
worthy of support,

29:36.859 --> 29:40.112
and unconditionally lovable.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.281
Until the Black woman
is allowed to reject

29:42.281 --> 29:43.908
this demand for strength,

29:43.908 --> 29:48.245
she'll never truly experience
her own humanity.

29:48.245 --> 29:51.582
Oh, good to see you awake
and in good spirits, Tyesha.

29:51.582 --> 29:53.501
Ooh, not the full
government name.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.919
Tye is fine.

29:54.919 --> 29:57.546
I had the surgery,
so I'm all good, right?

29:57.546 --> 29:59.840
I mean, I know there's
gonna be recovery time.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.675
Unfortunately, not quite.

30:01.675 --> 30:03.844
That cyst was just
the tip of the iceberg.

30:03.844 --> 30:06.597
You have several
medium and large

30:06.597 --> 30:09.850
fibroids and polyp
on your uterine lining.

30:09.850 --> 30:13.729
The good news is that we can
take care of everything at once

30:13.729 --> 30:15.105
with a hysterectomy.

30:15.105 --> 30:16.398
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:16.398 --> 30:18.275
Damn, that's a bit drastic,
don't you think?

30:18.275 --> 30:19.944
Of course it is.

30:19.944 --> 30:21.820
Well, I get the feeling

30:21.820 --> 30:23.697
you're not interested
in giving birth,

30:23.697 --> 30:26.534
and it really is the easiest
and most effective treatment.

30:26.534 --> 30:28.244
[scoffs]
Easiest for who?

30:28.244 --> 30:30.621
Just because I'm masc
doesn't mean I'm not a woman.

30:30.621 --> 30:32.581
And nobody asked you
for your feelings.

30:32.581 --> 30:34.458
[pager beeps]

30:34.458 --> 30:37.211
That would be the rest
of your labs, hang on.

30:37.211 --> 30:39.505
I am so sorry, Tye.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.465
I hate to be the voice
of reason, sweetheart,

30:41.465 --> 30:44.635
but maybe this is something
that we should all discuss

30:44.635 --> 30:46.595
before we rule it out
completely.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.014
I know I said
I don't want to have kids,

30:49.014 --> 30:52.059
but there's a difference
between not being able

30:52.059 --> 30:54.436
to have a baby
and not wanting to.

30:54.436 --> 30:56.105
True, and you know what?

30:56.105 --> 30:57.815
Who knows what
the future holds?

30:57.815 --> 31:00.067
You don't have
to make a decision

31:00.067 --> 31:01.277
with how you'd like to resolve

31:01.277 --> 31:02.528
the rest of the issues
right away,

31:02.528 --> 31:04.446
but sooner is better.

31:04.446 --> 31:07.700
Your labs look good enough
so I'm going to release you

31:07.700 --> 31:10.995
with some medication
and post-op instructions.

31:10.995 --> 31:13.956
Why don't you go home and talk
it over with your husband

31:13.956 --> 31:15.499
and get back to me
in a week or so?

31:15.499 --> 31:18.210
- This nigga.
- It is not 1950, okay?

31:18.210 --> 31:20.379
A woman does not need
to talk it over with a man

31:20.379 --> 31:23.257
when it comes to making
a decision about her body.

31:23.257 --> 31:25.676
I'm her husband.
Now what, asshole?

31:25.676 --> 31:26.927
Uh, you know what?
[chuckles]

31:26.927 --> 31:28.345
I am more her husband.

31:28.345 --> 31:30.598
Bitch, please, you're my wife,
and everyone knows this.

31:30.598 --> 31:31.724
Then who's husband am I?

31:31.724 --> 31:33.183
- Girl...
- I'm sorry.

31:33.183 --> 31:37.187
I don't want
to mis-pronoun anyone.

31:37.187 --> 31:39.523
Who is Brandon Jones?

31:39.523 --> 31:40.941
Nobody.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.901
That's the name that's
listed here on her HIPAA form

31:42.901 --> 31:45.988
and who gave us permission
to proceed with the surgery

31:45.988 --> 31:47.239
- while she was unconscious.
- What?

31:47.239 --> 31:48.532
What?
Oh, okay.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.618
So y'all are mixing up
paperwork now?

31:50.618 --> 31:52.411
I'm gonna have to call
my dad's attorney.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.371
This shit about
to be called Tye Memorial.

31:54.371 --> 31:56.206
Well, no, "Memorial" is like
when you're dead,

31:56.206 --> 31:57.625
- so maybe not that.
[Tye] Thank you, Camille.

31:57.625 --> 31:59.335
Don't undermine my point
in front of company.

31:59.335 --> 32:01.045
[knock on door]

32:04.465 --> 32:06.342
Hi, Tye.

32:06.342 --> 32:08.010
It's been a while.

32:08.010 --> 32:10.137
Huh, but who this, woman?

32:10.137 --> 32:11.805
Hi, Brandon.

32:11.805 --> 32:16.810
Uh, Brandon,
these are my friends.

32:16.810 --> 32:21.607
Friends,
this is Brandon Jones,

32:21.607 --> 32:23.025
my husband.

32:23.025 --> 32:25.944
[hip-hop music]

32:25.944 --> 32:28.447
[singer]

33:18.747 --> 33:20.124
Ah!
