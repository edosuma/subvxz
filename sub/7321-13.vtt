00:17.984 --> 00:19.781
<i>I believe in heaven.</i>

00:27.160 --> 00:29.094
<i>I also believe in hell.</i>

00:34.968 --> 00:37.766
<i>I've never seen either,</i>
<i>but I believe they exist.</i>

00:46.946 --> 00:49.073
<i>They have to exist.</i>

00:58.024 --> 01:00.458
<i>Because without a heaven...</i>

01:00.493 --> 01:02.552
<i>...without a hell...</i>

01:03.530 --> 01:05.657
<i>...we're all just headed for limbo.</i>

01:05.765 --> 01:07.426
You coming?

01:08.568 --> 01:10.695
If it's bad,
the nurses will come get us.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.399
Dr. Grey, he's seizing!

01:13.440 --> 01:15.635
How about now? Now can we go?

01:15.675 --> 01:19.202
Sadie, go find
something else to do. Now.

01:20.313 --> 01:21.337
That's an order.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.566
Why are you still here?

01:44.604 --> 01:47.869
- I'm here for you, Izzie Stevens.
- No, you're not,

01:47.907 --> 01:51.775
because I broke up with you.
So you are not here for me.

01:51.811 --> 01:53.870
I'm sorry, but...

01:55.415 --> 01:57.440
...you have to go.

01:57.484 --> 02:02.114
- I can't go. I'm here for...
- Me. Yeah. Right.

02:02.155 --> 02:04.919
- I am. I'm here for...
- Stop saying that!

02:21.741 --> 02:25.302
Dr. Bailey, I just called UNOS.

02:25.345 --> 02:28.212
Jackson's at the top of the list
for a liver and small bowel.

02:28.248 --> 02:31.547
They can't come soon enough.
His ammonia level's starting to rise.

02:31.584 --> 02:34.712
I thought the shunt was supposed
to buy us 24 hours.

02:34.754 --> 02:39.191
Isn't that what you said,
that it should give us 24 hours?

02:39.225 --> 02:41.125
We're doing everything we can.

02:42.362 --> 02:45.763
I know. I know you are.

02:49.035 --> 02:50.866
Will you excuse me?

02:57.076 --> 02:59.738
- Oh, my God
- He had a seizure.

02:59.779 --> 03:02.304
- I gave him lorazepam.
- You page Shepherd?

03:02.348 --> 03:04.816
- I paged you.
- Page Shepherd.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.513
- The patient doesn't want that.
- He tell you that?

03:07.554 --> 03:11.012
Yes. Don't page him.

03:11.057 --> 03:14.083
He's terribly unpleasant.

03:14.127 --> 03:18.757
Mr. Dunn is a match
for your kid who needs the transplant.

03:18.798 --> 03:20.197
He's a match.

03:20.767 --> 03:21.791
Uh-huh.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.302
All of this wasn't caused
from the seizure,

03:24.337 --> 03:27.363
- but I'm sure you know that already.
- Oh, no.

03:27.407 --> 03:29.170
This is my project.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.201
Dr. Grey does not get the credit.

03:32.245 --> 03:34.213
You probably have a brain bleed,

03:34.247 --> 03:36.442
which is why we need
to get Shepherd in here.

03:36.482 --> 03:38.780
Dr. Bailey, he's gonna die anyway.

03:38.818 --> 03:44.347
The boy who needs organs,
I presume, wants to live.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.824
And me?

03:46.859 --> 03:49.191
I have organs...

03:50.663 --> 03:52.893
...and I'm ready to die.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.894
- Dr. Sloan.
- Dr. Grey.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.441
- After you, Dr. Grey.
- Thank you, Dr. Sloan.

04:08.214 --> 04:12.412
It feels wrong on so many levels
I can't even count them.

04:12.452 --> 04:16.616
But there is no case in any medical book
that tells you how to deal with this.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.488
I don't need a book.
I do what's best for my patient.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.048
I suggest you do the same.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.063
- I am.
- Really? You page Shepherd yet?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.792
Are you gonna page him?

04:29.535 --> 04:33.232
I'm gonna do my best
to keep that beautiful boy alive

04:33.273 --> 04:35.764
long enough to find him some organs.

04:35.808 --> 04:39.972
I suggest you do everything you can
to keep your patient alive.

04:40.013 --> 04:43.676
Because we're doctors, Grey.
We're not... executioners.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.325
- Don't even tell me.
- Locked.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.626
People sleeping or...?

04:58.665 --> 05:02.499
- Why do I bother asking?
- This is ridiculous. I need sleep.

05:02.535 --> 05:04.833
Oh, my God!

05:04.871 --> 05:07.271
- That's not a good noise.
- That's a bad noise.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.275
That's a really bad noise.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.974
- Oh, my God! Are you OK?
- No!

05:15.014 --> 05:17.881
It's bent. In the middle.
I think I broke it!

05:17.917 --> 05:19.908
- Get Torres! Go!
- Um! Oh, OK.

05:52.118 --> 05:53.915
I'm getting a 911 page

05:53.953 --> 05:57.320
and I have a casserole in the oven
I spent half the night baking...

05:57.357 --> 05:59.450
- Hey.
- Whoa. I'm so sorry.

05:59.492 --> 06:01.983
- Is Cristina a... a... around?
- No.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.461
OK, then. OK, then.

06:03.496 --> 06:06.090
Yep.

06:06.132 --> 06:08.794
There's casserole in the oven
if you're hungry.

06:08.835 --> 06:10.200
Thank you.

06:15.174 --> 06:16.801
Has there been a change?

06:16.843 --> 06:21.212
- Has Matthew improved?
- I'm sorry. Still no brain activity.

06:24.317 --> 06:27.013
- What are you doing to him?
- Blood test.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.783
It's standard. Excuse us.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.954
You two are on Jackson all day today.

06:33.993 --> 06:36.052
He doesn't have a liver or intestines,

06:36.095 --> 06:40.794
toxins will build, his brain will swell.
We can't stop it, we can slow it down.

06:40.833 --> 06:44.360
You don't have time for this,
to think about anyone else.

06:44.404 --> 06:48.272
Stevens, I need a nod. A yawn.
Maybe even a little burp.

06:48.307 --> 06:51.970
Something that lets me know you're
capable of keeping this boy alive.

06:52.011 --> 06:53.808
Yes. Sorry. I'm all yours.

06:53.846 --> 06:55.871
Way to listen.
Thanks for that.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.975
Dr. Bailey, how much time
do we have left?

06:59.018 --> 07:00.610
Sixteen hours, at the most.

07:00.653 --> 07:04.214
There's a liver dialysis machine.
Gl is using it for a clinical trial.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.158
- Liver dialysis?
- It's new. Completely experimental.

07:07.193 --> 07:08.888
It could help get rid of the toxins.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.954
It may give Jackson
a few more hours... maybe.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.390
All right, Stevens,
put in the ICP monitor.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.337
Start tracking his intracranial
pressures. Karev, go get the machine.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.533
What if it's hooked up to somebody?

07:22.642 --> 07:26.772
If that somebody has more than 16
hours to live, then we'll unhook them.

07:28.848 --> 07:32.011
- I want off this case.
- Dr. Bailey?

07:32.051 --> 07:36.385
Oh, God, I want off this case. I want
off... This little boy is gonna die.

07:36.422 --> 07:39.152
And I don't wanna be there to see it.
I just don't...

07:39.192 --> 07:42.855
I can't see it... I want off.
I want off this case. I want off.

07:44.797 --> 07:48.096
- When was the last time you slept?
- No, no, I'm OK.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.467
- You need one or two hours of rest.
- I'm good.

07:51.504 --> 07:53.995
I'm fine. Just go.

07:57.543 --> 07:58.771
OK...

07:58.811 --> 08:01.371
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.512
Mmm.

08:08.054 --> 08:11.023
- Mmm. You're very happy.
- I am happy.

08:11.057 --> 08:13.525
I'm happy to see you. You're not happy.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.151
No, I've just been here all night.

08:15.194 --> 08:18.857
How is our resident psychopath?
Is he gone yet?

08:18.965 --> 08:23.163
- Yeah, yeah, soon.
- Good. Sooner he gets out, the better.

08:23.202 --> 08:24.635
Mm-hm.

08:25.938 --> 08:29.806
By the way, Mom likes you.

08:29.842 --> 08:33.243
She thinks you're good for me.

08:48.094 --> 08:53.259
- Oh! Dr. Torres! Thank God you're here.
- I'm headed to the pit, got a 911 page.

08:53.299 --> 08:56.291
It was me.
I paged you 911 for Dr. Sloan.

08:56.335 --> 08:59.304
He's the emergency. Himself.
It's on his person.

08:59.338 --> 09:02.671
- Mark's hurt?
- Yes. No. Yes. Badly injured.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.768
In a bad way, that is bad
for anyone who is a man,

09:05.811 --> 09:07.972
but for Dr. Sloan in particular.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.482
He may have broken a bone.

09:11.317 --> 09:13.046
- A bone?
- He broke a bone.

09:13.085 --> 09:16.054
I broke his bone.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.489
You're kidding, right?

09:22.428 --> 09:23.520
You're not kidding.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.501
Cristina, I wanted to apologize
for last night.

09:40.546 --> 09:43.538
It was not my intention
to arrive in that state.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.108
You don't have to say anything.

09:46.152 --> 09:49.781
As a rule, if I'm showering with
a woman I do it without my clothes.

09:49.822 --> 09:53.724
And if I get in her bed naked,
I don't pass out, and if I...

09:53.759 --> 09:54.817
It's OK.

09:55.561 --> 09:58.530
- It's not.
- It's not.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.662
But you don't have to talk about it.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.871
It's getting
a little harder to breathe.

10:14.981 --> 10:18.542
You can stop doing this, William.
You can stop at any time.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.383
I know.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.752
I know.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.815
Do you want me to page
Dr. Shepherd?

10:28.361 --> 10:30.454
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

10:32.098 --> 10:36.057
Yes. I had a feeling.

10:37.103 --> 10:39.196
Yes.

10:39.238 --> 10:41.263
I had a feeling.

10:42.575 --> 10:45.203
The man has very good taste.

10:47.113 --> 10:50.514
Right now all I think about are lemons.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.152
Lemons?

11:00.593 --> 11:05.690
When my grandfather was dying,
he said he smelled lemons.

11:07.099 --> 11:11.092
It's all he could talk about
for three days, the smell of lemons.

11:13.706 --> 11:16.869
I keep waiting to smell them,
and I don't.

11:19.679 --> 11:24.048
Of course, he was a big liar, so...

11:25.751 --> 11:28.879
Are you sure you don't want me
to page Dr. Shepherd?

11:28.921 --> 11:31.446
I'm sure.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.788
OK.

11:45.504 --> 11:48.473
O'Malley, whatever you're doing,
I need you to drop it.

11:48.507 --> 11:50.566
- I was going home.
- Not anymore.

11:52.478 --> 11:55.038
I need you to talk to the nurses.

11:55.081 --> 11:58.812
Find out if any patients on life support
are O positive or brain dead.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.684
Then cross-match those folks
against Jackson Prescott.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.155
- Kid's running out of time.
- OK.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.623
And O'Malley...

12:06.292 --> 12:08.260
Be sensitive to their families.

12:08.294 --> 12:11.058
We need organs for this boy,
but we can only ask.

12:11.097 --> 12:14.157
We can't pressure.
We can't coerce. Understood?

12:14.200 --> 12:15.360
Of course, sir.

12:18.704 --> 12:20.672
- Um, Cristina?
- Oh, Shepherd.

12:27.980 --> 12:30.574
- It's a ring.
- It's from my mother.

12:30.616 --> 12:34.052
It's from me. It was my mother's,
I'm gonna give it to Meredith soon.

12:34.086 --> 12:37.249
I'm looking for an opinion
on whether she's gonna like it,

12:37.289 --> 12:39.985
or I should have
the setting redone more modern.

12:40.025 --> 12:44.052
- That's really not my job.
- I know you two are still fighting.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.827
Isn't it about time you wrap that up?
I ask, because when I propose,

12:47.867 --> 12:50.301
she's gonna need somebody
to freak out to.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.170
She misses you.

12:54.206 --> 12:55.332
A lot.

12:55.374 --> 12:58.969
You must miss her. I don't know
what's going on in your life,

12:59.011 --> 13:02.139
but you must have something
you need to freak out to her about.

13:02.181 --> 13:04.706
I'm sorry.
You should ask someone else.

13:10.256 --> 13:13.885
Ms. Prescott? Have you
had anything to eat today?

13:13.926 --> 13:17.453
You should keep your strength up.
Get a cup of coffee or some food.

13:17.496 --> 13:20.021
I'll stay here with Jackson.
He's stable for now.

13:22.168 --> 13:24.193
Go on. I'll stay.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.536
You are like the guy
who graduated from high school

13:34.647 --> 13:37.241
and still hangs out
on the football field.

13:37.283 --> 13:40.184
- Do you believe in heaven?
- What?

13:40.219 --> 13:41.948
Heaven.

13:44.089 --> 13:46.114
I don't know. I guess.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.256
Because I thought that,
maybe, this was heaven.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.858
Getting to be here with you.

13:52.898 --> 13:58.097
But now...
Now I'm not so sure. I think this...

13:58.871 --> 14:02.602
- I think this may be hell, or...
- What are you talking about?

14:02.641 --> 14:04.575
- I'm here for you.
- For me, I know.

14:04.610 --> 14:08.410
I got it, I hear you...
a thousand times.

14:08.447 --> 14:13.009
I chose Alex. I'm sorry. I am.
I'm really sorry about that...

14:13.052 --> 14:14.485
And I'm still here.

14:14.520 --> 14:18.957
You broke up with me and I'm still here.
Doesn't that tell you anything?

14:18.991 --> 14:22.950
It tells me that you're jealous.
That you don't want me to be happy,

14:22.995 --> 14:27.762
- you don't want me to choose Alex...
- Damn it, listen! You can't pick Alex.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.234
- I'm here for you!
- Denny...

14:36.809 --> 14:38.674
I want you to be happy, Izzie.

14:39.178 --> 14:43.137
I do. And I would leave, if I could.

14:43.182 --> 14:47.585
You think I want to stay here
while you tell me you want another man?

14:50.322 --> 14:53.485
I can't go
because you won't listen to me.

14:54.093 --> 14:57.426
- I am here for you.
- What does that even mean?

14:58.631 --> 15:02.533
- What does it mean?
- You're a doctor, Izzie.

15:03.669 --> 15:05.364
Figure it out.

15:09.675 --> 15:10.699
Thank you.

15:12.611 --> 15:14.340
What?

15:15.180 --> 15:18.047
Did... What?

15:19.551 --> 15:20.745
Nothing.

15:22.888 --> 15:27.120
How's your serial killer?
Did you monitor him last night?

15:27.159 --> 15:29.923
Yeah. I got it covered.

15:36.402 --> 15:39.428
Cristina, I said I've got it covered.

15:53.052 --> 15:54.747
Tell me you paged Shepherd.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.379
- He wants to die.
- Meredith!

15:56.422 --> 15:59.414
He's gonna die anyway,
in a few days. If he dies here,

15:59.458 --> 16:03.622
we can donate organs to the ten-year-old
down the hall. Derek won't allow it.

16:03.662 --> 16:05.960
I didn't page him.
I hope you won't, either.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.399
I know you think this is wrong.
Just let me do this.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.702
Please... please help.

16:16.408 --> 16:18.706
Help me.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.939
I don't want to die.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.115
- I don't want to die.
- Page Shepherd right now!

16:26.218 --> 16:29.016
<i>Code blue, 3rd floor.</i>
<i>Code blue, 3rd floor.</i>

16:34.226 --> 16:37.889
- Should I thread the catheter?
- I want to see the Grand Canyon.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.524
- Visualize it on the ultrasound.
- I wanna hike it.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.899
Look out over Dead Man's Drop.
Not because I'm dead. Just 'cause,

16:43.936 --> 16:45.767
- you know, the view.
- Shut up.

16:46.972 --> 16:49.304
- What was that?
- Nothing.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.707
- Should I be able to see the needle?
- Yeah.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.406
That shadow within the lumen
is the catheter.

16:54.446 --> 16:58.576
Have we heard anything from UNOS?
Have we heard anything?

16:59.952 --> 17:00.976
I'll call them back.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.580
I'd also like to see
the Great Wall of China.

17:03.622 --> 17:07.455
I did a lot of traveling in my life but
never made it to Asia. I regret that.

17:07.925 --> 17:10.588
My point,
you unbelievably stubborn woman,

17:10.628 --> 17:15.362
is that there are other things
I would like to do and see.

17:15.401 --> 17:18.268
Things that I would like to,
but I can't.

17:18.303 --> 17:23.569
I can't go to heaven or hell or to Asia.
I can't do anything but this

17:23.608 --> 17:26.839
- until you figure it out.
- Would you just tell me already?!

17:32.684 --> 17:33.912
I'm sorry.

17:36.021 --> 17:38.888
Why don't you take a little break,
Dr. Stevens.

17:53.605 --> 17:56.665
Does your sister talk to you
anymore or just boss you around?

17:56.708 --> 18:00.576
She used to talk to me. Now she tells me
to get lost, like we aren't friends.

18:00.612 --> 18:03.206
- You hear Sloan broke his goods?
- What?

18:03.248 --> 18:06.115
- On-call room. I heard him scream.
- With Torres?

18:06.151 --> 18:09.518
Maybe. Whoever it was,
whoever rode him and broke him?

18:09.555 --> 18:11.682
That's a girl I want on me.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.085
Was it Torres?

18:14.126 --> 18:15.889
- What?
- Those two are off and on.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.589
Think she's the one who broke it?

18:17.629 --> 18:19.995
How should I know?
It's not my business.

18:20.032 --> 18:24.128
It's nobody's business. It's
definitely not yours... Not that I know.

18:24.169 --> 18:28.299
If I did know who broke Mark's penis,
I wouldn't tell you. We're not friends.

18:28.340 --> 18:32.640
I took out your appendix, almost ended
my career. That doesn't make us close.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.042
I want him prepped
and in the OR in 20 minutes.

18:39.084 --> 18:40.210
Yes, sir.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.786
Should have paged me a long time ago.

18:44.823 --> 18:48.020
Better yet, when I asked how he was,
you should have told me.

18:48.060 --> 18:51.621
- I was following the patient's wishes.
- He doesn't get wishes.

18:51.663 --> 18:54.131
- He killed five women.
- You believe you're right,

18:54.166 --> 18:57.192
I think I'm right. If I said
something there'd have been a debate.

18:57.236 --> 19:00.797
He's been manipulating you
since he got here. He preys on women.

19:00.839 --> 19:03.637
- I made a decision as his doctor.
- A bad decision.

19:03.675 --> 19:07.771
It was the wrong decision.
You're gonna scrub in on his surgery

19:07.813 --> 19:10.941
and watch while I try like hell
to undo what you did.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.624
- His ICP's not going under 25.
- Is the catheter occluded?

19:19.658 --> 19:21.023
- Looks fine.
- All right.

19:21.059 --> 19:24.722
Try adjusting the height of the drip
chamber. Raise his bed 10 degrees.

19:24.763 --> 19:27.197
- What'll that do?
- Not much.

19:27.232 --> 19:30.531
Jackson. Jackson, listen to Mommy.

19:30.569 --> 19:34.733
It's not time. You do not get to go yet.

19:34.773 --> 19:38.834
You have to stay here with me.
You hear me? You stay with Mommy.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.072
It is not time, baby. I love you.

19:41.113 --> 19:44.947
And I need you to fight.
I need you to fight, Jackson.

19:44.983 --> 19:49.545
Come on, come on.
You fight to stay alive.

20:08.574 --> 20:12.476
- Yeah, that's a penile fracture.
- Oh, I'm gonna kill myself.

20:12.511 --> 20:15.708
- We should operate, then kill yourself.
- Oh, God!

20:15.747 --> 20:19.877
- Can you do it?
- Him? No! He's a meatballer.

20:19.918 --> 20:22.386
He is meticulous
and he will keep his mouth shut.

20:22.421 --> 20:25.481
Mainly because I've seen you naked
in a resident's bedroom.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.856
I've done this before.
It's not complicated.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.986
Guys run into this on the battlefield?

20:30.028 --> 20:33.623
Don't think we should talk about
how guys run into this. Line up an OR.

20:33.665 --> 20:36.634
We need to get in fast
or you risk permanent damage.

20:36.668 --> 20:38.966
Oh, God!
No permanent damage, please.

20:42.374 --> 20:46.140
- Hey...
- Little Grey, go away.

20:46.178 --> 20:49.306
- I don't want you to see me like this.
- I made you like this.

20:49.348 --> 20:51.009
I'm saying "please," here.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.577
Please.

21:00.292 --> 21:01.316
Uh...

21:06.164 --> 21:08.098
Talk to me, O'Malley.

21:10.135 --> 21:12.194
- My God.
- The guy's not a donor.

21:12.237 --> 21:14.432
They're about to unplug him.

21:34.092 --> 21:36.822
- Dr. Shepherd!
- Dr. Bailey?

21:38.030 --> 21:40.396
I need you to stop.

21:40.432 --> 21:44.425
I need you to put down the scalpel.
This man is trying to kill himself.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.960
God forgive me, I need you to let him.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.647
You need to leave my OR, Dr. Bailey.

22:03.689 --> 22:07.819
In five days... In five days
this man is going to die,

22:07.859 --> 22:10.123
and his organs are gonna go with him.

22:10.162 --> 22:14.394
They'll be buried with his body,
and they'll rot in the ground,

22:14.433 --> 22:17.368
and that is a crime.

22:17.402 --> 22:20.098
It's a crime against life.

22:20.138 --> 22:22.732
It's only five days. That's it.

22:23.275 --> 22:27.211
That's all we're taking from him,
and he doesn't want them anyway.

22:30.949 --> 22:34.646
- We took an oath, Miranda.
- I know... that.

22:34.686 --> 22:38.053
I know we took an oath, but...

22:38.090 --> 22:41.617
...right now, that oath makes no sense.

22:41.660 --> 22:44.788
It makes no sense. It doesn't.

22:44.830 --> 22:48.732
Just stop.
Don't do anything else for this man.

22:51.436 --> 22:54.234
If I stop this surgery,

22:54.272 --> 22:57.469
it's the same as me sticking
this scalpel into his brain.

22:59.845 --> 23:01.745
Is that what you want?

23:03.915 --> 23:06.179
Yes. That's what I want.

23:16.128 --> 23:19.461
- I'm sorry, what do you want?
- I'm sorry.

23:19.498 --> 23:22.160
I know this is excruciating.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.895
But what I want...

23:23.935 --> 23:26.130
...what I need...

23:27.639 --> 23:31.541
...are your husband's organs.
His liver and his bowels.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.544
- He's a match for...
- Go away.

23:34.713 --> 23:36.806
- I'm sorry?
- Please, go away.

23:36.848 --> 23:39.817
I don't want anyone
cutting into him anymore.

23:40.585 --> 23:41.950
I can't.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.185
I can't take any more.

23:46.057 --> 23:47.456
He was healthy.

23:48.827 --> 23:50.795
He was healthy two days ago.

23:50.862 --> 23:52.921
He's my love.

23:52.964 --> 23:56.058
And he put his head
through a windshield.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.394
And I have to unplug him.

24:00.071 --> 24:03.700
He is the person who is supposed
to hold my hand when things go bad.

24:03.742 --> 24:05.835
He is supposed to be here to help.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.676
But he gets to go to heaven.

24:10.916 --> 24:13.043
I can't take any more.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.745
I can barely do this.

24:15.787 --> 24:19.086
So, please, go away.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.786
I don't want anyone cutting into him.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.571
Thanks for doing this, by the way.
I know you didn't have to.

24:41.613 --> 24:44.980
Apparently I did, or you would
blackmail me to keep me quiet.

24:46.017 --> 24:49.976
- I wasn't gonna actually do anything.
- I wasn't gonna say anything.

24:53.758 --> 24:56.591
Uh, it wasn't me, by the way. With Mark.

24:56.628 --> 24:59.324
- In case you were wondering.
- Wondering what?

24:59.364 --> 25:00.831
Who broke him.

25:00.866 --> 25:04.802
We're just friends. I mean, we also...

25:04.836 --> 25:08.738
We don't really, actually, anymore.
He got involved with somebody else

25:08.773 --> 25:10.673
plus I'm a lesbian now, maybe.

25:10.709 --> 25:13.303
Sort of. I don't know.

25:13.345 --> 25:17.679
Anyway, he took up with somebody else.
That's cool, 'cause I'm celibate.

25:18.316 --> 25:20.807
I cook now, which is totally great.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.343
I roasted a chicken. I'm happy for him,

25:23.388 --> 25:27.051
that he's got somebody who can,
you know, shake and break him.

25:28.727 --> 25:33.096
I guess I'd be lying if I said I didn't
miss having a backup penis,

25:33.131 --> 25:35.156
just in case I'm not a lesbian.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.033
And he was my friend, too.
I guess he still is,

25:38.069 --> 25:42.369
but it's never the same when somebody's
getting all into somebody new,

25:42.407 --> 25:45.638
so it's kind of like
I've lost both those things,

25:45.677 --> 25:47.304
the penis and the friend.

25:50.715 --> 25:53.650
I hate to lose one good thing,
never mind two.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.655
Sometimes I get started talking

26:02.694 --> 26:05.390
and I... say more than I should.

26:05.430 --> 26:07.330
Picked up on that.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.995
Cristina can seem cold, but...

26:15.040 --> 26:17.201
...that's just a lid,

26:17.242 --> 26:20.803
a lid on a jar that holds her feelings.

26:20.845 --> 26:24.212
But... it's a big jar.

26:24.249 --> 26:27.218
So don't give up too easy.

26:27.252 --> 26:31.279
Torres, I hope
you find your backup penis

26:31.323 --> 26:33.883
or a great lesbian to cook for.

26:33.925 --> 26:37.554
- Whichever.
- Thank you.

26:46.538 --> 26:47.630
How's he doing?

26:47.672 --> 26:50.368
Intercranial pressure's
through the roof.

26:50.408 --> 26:52.035
Where the hell have you been?

26:53.078 --> 26:56.104
I... had some stuff.

26:57.749 --> 26:59.842
Dead man talking stuff?

27:01.152 --> 27:03.620
Yeah, I... I don't know.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.748
This kid is dying in front of his mom.

27:05.790 --> 27:09.886
It's so bad Dr. Bailey, Dr. Bailey
can't stay in here and watch.

27:11.196 --> 27:15.394
But we're busting our asses to save him,
and you're talking to a dead guy.

27:15.433 --> 27:19.233
You want to do that crap at home, fine.
But not here. Here you're a doctor.

27:19.270 --> 27:21.431
Start acting like one.

27:24.609 --> 27:27.305
- ICP's too high.
- I just gave him hypertonic saline.

27:27.345 --> 27:30.781
- When was his last lorazepam?
- Gave him a bolus 20 minutes ago.

27:30.815 --> 27:34.080
Put him on a drip with Vec.
And put him on a BIS monitor.

27:34.119 --> 27:35.814
Check with UNOS again.

27:35.854 --> 27:37.947
I know it's a long shot. Just go.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.786
Uh-huh.

27:40.859 --> 27:44.625
Whatever Bailey's doing, I hope
she's having better luck than we are.

27:46.831 --> 27:50.699
He's hemorrhaging through his
craniectomy. Should I put in a drain?

27:52.003 --> 27:53.527
That's up to Dr. Bailey.

27:54.305 --> 27:55.897
Dr. Bailey?

27:57.609 --> 28:00.339
- Dr. Bailey? Should I put in a drain?
- No.

28:01.212 --> 28:03.305
There's a lot of bleeding...

28:03.348 --> 28:06.215
- I'm aware of that, Dr. Yang.
- Sir, really soon.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.455
It's your call, Dr. Bailey.

28:16.127 --> 28:17.754
It's up to you.

28:17.796 --> 28:21.288
Am I an executioner or am I a surgeon?

28:22.834 --> 28:26.702
It's up to you. It's your call.

28:43.288 --> 28:45.256
Pick up the scalpel.

29:09.047 --> 29:13.711
He can't take his liver to heaven,
can't take his bowels or kidneys.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.653
His brain is gone,
but those organs are probably good

29:16.688 --> 29:18.679
because he's a young man.

29:18.723 --> 29:21.715
And I know this is not
what you want to think about.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.854
It's more than anyone
should ever have to think about.

29:26.331 --> 29:28.697
But he can't take his organs with him.

29:32.036 --> 29:35.528
I heard it was this physical
therapist from the rehab floor

29:35.573 --> 29:38.007
who does this fancy yoga thing,

29:38.042 --> 29:41.705
where she turns herself into a pretzel
while she's on top of a guy.

29:41.746 --> 29:44.510
- She quit two weeks ago.
- I thought it was Torres.

29:44.549 --> 29:47.575
Whoever it was is going down
in Seattle Grace history.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.587
Sloan is a legend.

29:49.621 --> 29:53.921
Can you imagine the kind of muscle
it takes to break a man like that?

29:53.958 --> 29:56.791
Shut up! Just shut up about it!

29:59.197 --> 30:03.566
- You know something.
- I know that it's nobody's business.

30:03.601 --> 30:06.798
She knows something. Did you
see somebody come out of the room?

30:06.838 --> 30:08.567
Maybe it was her.

30:08.606 --> 30:11.097
What?

30:11.142 --> 30:13.804
It was me. OK? Can we drop it?

30:13.845 --> 30:15.710
It was me.

30:16.514 --> 30:20.610
I do this twist and shout thing
that blows most guys' minds,

30:20.652 --> 30:24.986
and I guess I twisted a little too far,
and almost took the whole thing off. OK?

30:46.744 --> 30:48.837
I can feel you.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.814
I can smell you.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.409
If you're dead,
how come I can smell your skin?

30:53.451 --> 30:56.784
So I'm thinking, maybe, you're not dead.

30:57.722 --> 31:00.919
Maybe that was the part of me
that was crazy.

31:00.959 --> 31:04.190
Maybe this is the not crazy part.
You're still alive.

31:04.229 --> 31:05.821
Right? That's it?

31:07.332 --> 31:09.357
I'm sorry. No.

31:11.402 --> 31:13.563
Then how come I can feel your heart?

31:14.873 --> 31:17.535
Because I'm real... to you.

31:19.244 --> 31:22.975
Are you a ghost or a dream or...?

31:23.781 --> 31:27.046
You're a doctor, Izzie, a scientist.

31:27.085 --> 31:29.679
- Think like a scientist.
- I am.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.621
I am!

31:31.656 --> 31:35.023
Scientists believe what they can see.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.687
What they can feel. Facts.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.492
Hard facts.

31:41.366 --> 31:43.857
I slapped you. That is a fact.

31:43.902 --> 31:48.862
I felt your face on my hand. Fact.

31:48.907 --> 31:52.365
We made love. That's a fact.

31:52.410 --> 31:55.743
I can feel your breath
against my skin. Fact.

31:56.514 --> 31:58.448
Fact. Fact.

32:00.985 --> 32:03.215
Izzie. Izzie, Izzie.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.647
What's happening?

32:06.724 --> 32:08.851
You tell me.

32:10.161 --> 32:11.685
I'm scared.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.007
ICP's still going up.

32:33.051 --> 32:35.849
- Are you hyperventilating him enough?
- Yes.

32:35.887 --> 32:37.912
Raise him all the way up.

32:37.956 --> 32:41.357
Jackson, you have to hold on.
OK, baby?

32:41.392 --> 32:44.589
Melinda, step back. You're in the way.
You need to step back.

32:44.629 --> 32:48.827
Hold on for Mommy, OK?
Please, Jackson. Please!

32:48.866 --> 32:50.663
Ms. Prescott.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.830
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no!
- You have to let them work on him.

32:53.871 --> 32:58.205
I can't leave my son.
I can't. I can't leave him. Please.

32:58.242 --> 33:00.710
- Let me stay, please!
- We'll be outside.

33:01.746 --> 33:04.977
- You see any bleeders?
- Field looks clear.

33:05.016 --> 33:08.179
Nice work, Dr. Yang.
Go ahead and close up.

33:08.219 --> 33:10.744
- Thank you, sir.
- What a waste.

33:11.789 --> 33:14.587
He's alive, Dr. Grey. We saved a life.

33:15.059 --> 33:16.720
That's never a waste.

33:19.864 --> 33:22.059
He's just a little boy.

33:22.100 --> 33:25.934
He's never had a sleepover.
He's never learned to ride a bike.

33:25.970 --> 33:28.962
Melinda, listen to me.

33:29.007 --> 33:33.307
Miracles happen. Medical miracles
happen every day. People live.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.141
Even when they shouldn't.

33:35.179 --> 33:39.047
I need to be with him.
He's never been anywhere without me.

33:39.083 --> 33:42.883
He can't go alone.
I need to be with him.

33:43.421 --> 33:47.790
You are here with him. You're here for
him even though you aren't in the room.

33:47.825 --> 33:50.259
You are. You are here for him.

33:50.294 --> 33:51.921
You're...

33:52.764 --> 33:56.632
<i>I'm here for you, Izzie Stevens.</i>

33:56.667 --> 33:59.295
- I'm here for you.
- You're not real.

33:59.337 --> 34:01.669
- I told you, I'm here for you.
- You are not real.

34:01.706 --> 34:04.698
Izzie, I told you, I'm here for you.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.103
Dr. Bailey says you need to come now.

34:24.829 --> 34:26.319
It's time to hold him.

34:26.364 --> 34:29.958
He's going, Melinda.
Hold him and help him go.

34:48.652 --> 34:51.884
It's OK, baby. You can go.

34:51.989 --> 34:55.447
It's OK. You can go.

34:57.628 --> 35:00.654
It's OK, Mommy won't be mad.

35:01.299 --> 35:05.201
You can go, Jackson. It's OK.

35:06.270 --> 35:09.137
It's OK, Jackson. You can go.

35:09.173 --> 35:10.697
We have organs!

35:11.742 --> 35:14.905
We have organs!
Get him to OR 3 now!

35:16.714 --> 35:19.342
- Starting CPR!
- Push.35 of epi.

35:19.383 --> 35:21.078
Fifty of bicarb.

35:57.588 --> 35:59.715
Finishing the vena cava.

36:00.591 --> 36:02.923
Releasing the clamps.

36:05.930 --> 36:08.398
Do we have any black spots?

36:09.834 --> 36:11.358
Looks clean.

36:14.105 --> 36:15.629
He's coding.

36:15.673 --> 36:18.335
Start CPR! Get the crash cart over here!

36:31.088 --> 36:34.148
- Heaven or hell.
- Yes.

36:36.494 --> 36:38.325
You're here for me.

36:39.764 --> 36:42.096
- Yes.
- No.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.831
You're not here for me.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.666
You're here for me.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.930
You're here for me.

36:49.974 --> 36:52.204
You came to get me.

36:53.244 --> 36:55.610
I didn't know what heaven was.

36:57.348 --> 36:59.646
I thought you were my heaven.

37:00.918 --> 37:02.749
I loved you so much.

37:03.788 --> 37:07.815
I loved you so much that
when I got to come back for you...

37:07.858 --> 37:09.450
...I thought...

37:11.596 --> 37:13.291
...you are my heaven.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.625
But, maybe...

37:19.070 --> 37:21.038
...maybe I'm your hell.

37:23.641 --> 37:25.165
I'm sick.

37:26.844 --> 37:28.971
I'm sick, aren't I?

37:29.013 --> 37:31.641
And instead of telling me...

37:33.818 --> 37:36.446
Instead of telling me to save my life...

37:36.487 --> 37:41.652
You son of a bitch!
You selfish son of bitch! I hate you!

37:41.692 --> 37:44.456
I didn't know there was a chance.
Miracles happen!

37:44.495 --> 37:48.056
Medical miracles happen every day.
You said it. You said that.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.693
Leave! Leave.

37:55.940 --> 38:01.173
I can go now... because you know.

38:02.079 --> 38:05.344
But it's your choice. You get to choose.

38:06.250 --> 38:09.083
But, Iz, if I go...

38:10.154 --> 38:14.113
...I don't know. I don't know
if I can come back. If I go...

38:14.158 --> 38:17.184
In the choice between heaven and hell,

38:17.228 --> 38:20.061
I choose heaven! I choose life!

38:20.097 --> 38:23.225
Go! Get out of here!
Go! Get out of here!

38:23.701 --> 38:25.066
Go.

38:26.737 --> 38:29.535
- I really hope this is heaven.
- Go.

38:32.743 --> 38:34.108
Yeah...

38:35.446 --> 38:37.414
What are you waiting for?

38:45.056 --> 38:46.148
This.

39:17.121 --> 39:19.248
I'm alive.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.826
Yes, you are.

39:27.965 --> 39:30.365
I was playing you.

39:30.935 --> 39:33.062
Your boyfriend was right.

39:33.104 --> 39:36.904
I wanted to destroy your career.

39:36.941 --> 39:40.172
I was playing you the whole time,
Dr. Grey.

39:41.112 --> 39:44.673
And I wanted to be here
to see the fallout.

39:49.854 --> 39:52.254
You were scared, William.

39:52.289 --> 39:55.383
Death is scary.
I would've been scared, too.

40:04.602 --> 40:08.333
It'd be good to have
a friendly face in the crowd...

40:12.376 --> 40:14.139
...when they kill me.

40:39.770 --> 40:43.934
I planned a whole evening...
last night. A real date.

40:45.176 --> 40:49.135
It was a clear night,
one of the five Seattle gets all year.

40:49.313 --> 40:52.578
I was going to take you
to the West Point Lighthouse,

40:52.616 --> 40:55.676
and we were gonna watch
the Northern Lights together.

40:58.989 --> 41:01.219
I had a planned date.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.262
I'd like another chance.

41:12.570 --> 41:15.038
I want you to give me another chance.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.299
You've got some problems.

41:19.143 --> 41:22.078
You've got some big problems.

41:22.112 --> 41:23.670
Yeah.

41:24.081 --> 41:25.810
Yeah... Yeah. I do.

41:30.788 --> 41:32.483
Will you go out with me, anyway?

41:39.063 --> 41:40.587
Yes.

41:51.709 --> 41:54.473
- Hey.
- Please go away.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.276
- No.
- Little Grey...

41:57.314 --> 42:00.340
It's not Little Grey. It's Lexie.

42:00.384 --> 42:05.048
And I'm sorry that I broke your...

42:05.089 --> 42:07.489
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.959
And I'm sorry that you're humiliated.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.826
But I'm not going anywhere.

42:13.631 --> 42:17.192
I've got a friend
who is guarding the door.

42:17.234 --> 42:20.761
A good friend. And since no one
is going to be coming in,

42:20.804 --> 42:25.207
I am now going to climb into bed
with you and stroke your hair.

42:25.709 --> 42:29.372
Because that's what I like to have
done for me when I'm hurt.

42:59.143 --> 43:00.872
How is he?

43:01.579 --> 43:05.345
We were so late getting those organs in.

43:05.382 --> 43:10.945
Between the cerebral edema
and the reperfusion coding,

43:10.988 --> 43:14.446
we don't know what kind of damage
was done to his brain.

43:14.491 --> 43:17.324
We don't even know
if he's going to wake up.

43:19.063 --> 43:21.190
I crossed a line today.

43:21.665 --> 43:26.102
I endangered my medical license

43:29.039 --> 43:30.836
I crossed a line.

43:32.810 --> 43:34.675
So did I.

44:18.555 --> 44:22.651
<i>Heaven. Hell. Limbo.</i>

44:27.631 --> 44:29.895
<i>No one really knows where we're going...</i>

45:35.332 --> 45:37.027
Lemons.

45:39.603 --> 45:41.764
My grandfather wasn't lying after all.

45:41.805 --> 45:44.330
<i>...or what's waiting for us</i>
<i>when we get there.</i>

46:21.612 --> 46:25.343
<i>But the one thing we can say,</i>
<i>for sure, with absolute certainty...</i>

46:41.698 --> 46:43.290
Jackson?

46:49.206 --> 46:51.037
Can I have some water?

46:53.310 --> 46:54.334
Oh!

46:56.213 --> 46:59.774
<i>...is that there are moments</i>
<i>that take us to another place...</i>

47:30.514 --> 47:33.449
I know you don't understand me.

47:35.018 --> 47:38.044
I don't understand me.

47:39.923 --> 47:42.824
I wanted to show him compassion.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.691
That's why I went.

47:44.728 --> 47:47.162
That's the reason.

47:47.197 --> 47:51.896
And it was horrible. It was horrible.

47:54.504 --> 47:55.937
It's OK.

47:58.442 --> 48:00.501
It's OK.

48:04.414 --> 48:08.077
She's in the car
and she won't stop crying.

48:08.118 --> 48:11.884
- Did you propose?
- No. She went to William's execution.

48:12.623 --> 48:14.648
<i>...moments of heaven on Earth.</i>

48:37.614 --> 48:40.777
<i>And maybe, for now,</i>
<i>that's all we need to know.</i>
