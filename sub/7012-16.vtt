00:05.220 --> 00:07.540
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!

00:07.580 --> 00:10.780
"Skinny Dill-hole
Talks Like an Idiot"?

00:10.860 --> 00:13.060
Yeah, yeah. I read it.

00:13.140 --> 00:18.100
No. Guess who was voted
Point Place High's Most Eligible Viking?

00:18.180 --> 00:21.100
Tommy Larkin?

00:21.140 --> 00:23.660
Well, he is dreamy.

00:23.700 --> 00:28.940
No. Me, thank you
very much.

00:29.020 --> 00:32.100
Congratulations, Eric. I guess this
opens up a whole new world for you...

00:32.180 --> 00:34.980
one where you can
actually date chicks.

00:36.420 --> 00:39.500
And don't think I haven't
already thought of that, my friend.

00:49.860 --> 00:51.820
Bachelorina Number One...

00:51.900 --> 00:56.580
I've been diagnosed with a disease
that makes me irresistible to women.

00:56.660 --> 01:01.420
If you were my doctor,
what would you do to treat me?

01:02.820 --> 01:05.620
I'd order you to stay in bed
for three weeks...

01:06.620 --> 01:09.260
with me.

01:09.340 --> 01:12.140
Uh-oh. I'm feeling
better already.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.300
- Bachelorina Number Two?
- Well...

01:15.380 --> 01:19.460
I'd have you strip down
for a complete physical.

01:19.540 --> 01:22.740
Well, then I guess we know...

01:22.780 --> 01:24.660
what's up, Doc.

01:26.060 --> 01:28.260
Number Three?

01:28.340 --> 01:30.580
I'd write you
a prescription for love...

01:30.620 --> 01:34.140
and tell you to take me
three times a day.

01:34.220 --> 01:37.700
Careful, I might O.D.

01:39.780 --> 01:41.620
Well, Eric...

01:44.740 --> 01:46.580
it's time to choose.

01:46.660 --> 01:50.060
Which one of these luscious,
fawning chicks will it be?

01:51.180 --> 01:53.260
Gosh, they all sound so great.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.180
I can't decide.

01:55.220 --> 01:58.900
Well, that's okay. You're Point
Place High's Most Eligible Viking.

01:58.980 --> 02:01.100
You can have them all!

02:01.140 --> 02:03.540
How tremendously fair!

02:03.580 --> 02:06.540
Kelso, tell Eric
what he gets.

02:06.620 --> 02:10.259
Bachelorina Number One...

02:10.340 --> 02:13.140
is a hot cheerleader.

02:13.180 --> 02:17.180
Bachelorina Number Two
is a hot cheerleader.

02:17.260 --> 02:19.780
Bachelorina Number Three
is a hot gymnast...

02:19.860 --> 02:22.580
who used to be
a hot cheerleader.

02:25.220 --> 02:27.060
Well, until next time...

02:27.140 --> 02:30.700
this is Eric's jealous friend Hyde saying,
"I wish I was Eric Forman."

02:30.740 --> 02:32.660
So long!

02:40.260 --> 02:43.660
Forman, don't put me in your fantasies.
I don't even like being in your real life.

02:46.060 --> 02:49.260
You can put me in your fantasies.
I don't mind.

02:50.740 --> 02:52.660
I don't have
a lot going on.

03:28.180 --> 03:30.060
Oh, hey, Donna.

03:30.140 --> 03:33.300
Hey, um, did you see
the school paper?

03:35.380 --> 03:38.220
Oh, yeah. Field hockey team's
going to state. Whoo-hoo!

03:40.820 --> 03:43.020
Uh-oh. Looks like someone
doesn't wanna talk about...

03:43.100 --> 03:45.900
the new Most Eligible Viking.

03:48.260 --> 03:50.740
Look, Donna,
this whole, uh...

03:50.820 --> 03:53.420
"Most Eligible" thing has
really taught me something.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.860
Um, I'm pretty.

03:58.540 --> 04:01.260
<i>So, what do you say...</i>

04:01.300 --> 04:04.140
like, we officially
start dating other people?

04:04.180 --> 04:06.340
Oh, I've been waiting
for your permission.

04:07.540 --> 04:11.220
And can I stay out past 9:00,
please, please?

04:11.300 --> 04:13.220
As long as you're gonna be cool
when you see me with...

04:13.300 --> 04:16.459
one, two or seven of
Point Place's juiciest tomatoes.

04:16.540 --> 04:18.940
It's just like old times...

04:19.019 --> 04:23.660
Eric and Donna talking about
meaningless crap that affects only them.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.580
I've missed it so.

04:29.260 --> 04:31.140
I <i>have</i> missed it.

04:35.660 --> 04:37.540
I don't have a lot going on.

04:41.420 --> 04:43.940
Hey, look here.

04:44.020 --> 04:48.220
That '58 Corvette down
at the used-car lot is still for sale.

04:48.300 --> 04:52.460
Oh, and look here. That diamond bracelet
down at the mall is still for sale.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.460
Hey, Red, get this.

05:00.540 --> 05:04.940
A while back, I'm in my car crying,
'cause Midgie was gone...

05:05.020 --> 05:07.620
and I kept having to reach
into the glove box for tissues.

05:07.660 --> 05:09.620
Oh, that's dangerous.

05:09.700 --> 05:13.820
One time I had to blow my nose. Nearly
hit that cockeyed girl down the street.

05:17.940 --> 05:20.540
I could've sworn
she was lookin' right at me.

05:24.460 --> 05:27.620
So I attached a box of tissues
to the sun visor...

05:27.700 --> 05:31.980
sold the idea for a bundle,
and voilÃ .

05:32.020 --> 05:34.900
The Weeper Keeper was born.

05:34.980 --> 05:38.300
Oh, God.
Are you rich again?

05:38.380 --> 05:40.220
Yep.

05:40.300 --> 05:43.780
I'm back to my
I-can-buy-anything-I-want former self.

05:43.860 --> 05:46.780
Just picked up two sombreros
and a case of Lik-m-aid.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.740
Where are you gonna wear
a sombrero, Bob?

05:52.820 --> 05:56.780
Where <i>won't</i> I wear it?

05:58.020 --> 06:00.340
Okay, you guys, which one
of these lucky ladies...

06:00.420 --> 06:04.740
gets to go out with
Point Place High's Most Eligible Viking?

06:04.820 --> 06:08.980
Start with the gymnastics team,
but go with the second string...

06:09.060 --> 06:11.260
just as limber
and somethin' to prove.

06:14.860 --> 06:18.380
- How about her?
- Yeah, I made out with her once.

06:18.460 --> 06:22.460
Okay, I don't want my tongue
where Kelso's tongue has been.

06:22.540 --> 06:25.380
Oh, you better stay away
from your mom then.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.380
I was kidding!

06:35.980 --> 06:39.220
- What about her?
- Hey, I know her, man.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.540
She's not all there,
if you know what I mean.

06:42.940 --> 06:46.580
- She's a space case, huh?
- No, she's missing a toe.

06:51.860 --> 06:55.620
Oh, you guys. There's that girl Emily.
Problem solved.

06:55.660 --> 06:57.580
Excuse me, fellas.

06:59.660 --> 07:02.820
- Hey, Emily.
- Oh, hi, Eric.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.980
- I saw your name in the paper.
- God, that totally slipped my mind...

07:06.060 --> 07:08.980
although I think I have a copy right here.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.380
Look at him.

07:13.420 --> 07:16.580
Donna, you have to start dating,
or you're gonna look pathetic.

07:16.660 --> 07:20.460
And <i>I'm</i> gonna look pathetic
for being seen with you.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.540
I know.
I'll set you up.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.460
Uh-uh. Mm-mmm.

07:24.540 --> 07:27.460
- Okay, if you don't wanna do this, just say so.
- I don't wanna do it.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.180
Oh, you don't know
what you want.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.500
Oh, my God.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.740
Oh, my God.

07:38.820 --> 07:43.620
Rhonda just said she has something special
to share with me tomorrow night.

07:43.700 --> 07:46.340
It can only mean that
we're going to do it!

07:48.660 --> 07:51.860
No, no, no. Listen to me.
I need a place to do it...

07:51.940 --> 07:54.180
roomy and cheap.

07:55.340 --> 07:57.220
Just like my Rhonda.

07:58.180 --> 08:00.660
You can use the Fotohut, man.

08:00.740 --> 08:05.220
I'm always happy to lend it out
for deflowering and bar mitzvahs.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.580
Thank you, Leo.

08:09.660 --> 08:13.140
Tomorrow night,
Fez becomes a man.

08:13.220 --> 08:15.140
Oh, so it is a bar mitzvah.

08:24.020 --> 08:26.980
Well, Bob, thanks for insisting
on coming along.

08:28.180 --> 08:31.340
So, Red, what's so special
about this thing?

08:31.420 --> 08:34.100
It's barely got a trunk.
Where do you put the groceries?

08:34.179 --> 08:37.700
This car isn't
about groceries.

08:37.780 --> 08:40.260
It's about freedom.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.700
Speaking of freedom,
they got free doughnuts.

09:09.420 --> 09:12.220
So long, dumb-ass!

09:15.980 --> 09:17.860
- Hey, Red.
- Hey. Oh, yeah.

09:17.900 --> 09:20.780
Yeah, there's plenty
of leg room in here. Oh.

09:20.860 --> 09:23.380
Glad you like it.
I just bought it.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.780
You what?

09:28.820 --> 09:31.420
Yeah, I'm pickin' it up
tomorrow.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.620
Sure hope that trunk
will hold my sombreros.

09:47.660 --> 09:49.860
Oh, is it my turn?

09:49.940 --> 09:53.500
Oh, funny, 'cause tonight
is also my turn... Ah! To do it.

09:58.700 --> 10:01.740
Guess what, Eric?
Donna has a date tonight too.

10:03.260 --> 10:05.380
Yep, yep, yep. Mm-hmm.

10:05.460 --> 10:08.580
I set her up with
Michael's older brother, Casey.

10:12.780 --> 10:16.860
<i>Oh, man, Donna's going out</i>
<i>with Casey Kelso?</i>

10:16.940 --> 10:20.620
Casey "What's the big deal?
It's just a misdemeanor" Kelso?

10:22.940 --> 10:25.900
Man, that's gonna be
the best bad date ever.

10:25.980 --> 10:28.020
Hey, we should hide
in the trunk.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.980
Oh, like Sprytle
and Chimchim!

10:32.300 --> 10:35.780
Oh, my God. I would pay
to see that date.

10:35.860 --> 10:38.260
Oh, uh...
"So, Casey...

10:38.340 --> 10:40.700
what are your thoughts
on feminism?"

10:40.780 --> 10:43.140
"Well, Donna, I think
it can munch my butt."

10:43.180 --> 10:45.100
Oh.

10:49.140 --> 10:52.100
All right. Hey.
My brother's not that bad, okay?

10:52.180 --> 10:54.780
He taught us lot of good,
useful stuff about chicks...

10:54.860 --> 10:57.900
like, the bigger the boobs,
the smaller the brain.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.540
That's a timeless truth.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.500
I'll tell you another
timeless truth.

11:03.540 --> 11:05.460
I'm going to do it!

11:10.860 --> 11:14.540
I don't know why I let you
set me up with Casey Kelso.

11:14.620 --> 11:18.220
From what I remember,
he's, like, a Kelso.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.700
Ooh, he's here.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.900
Okay, come on.
Try to look pretty.

11:23.980 --> 11:25.900
That's it? That's all
I get is a honk?

11:25.980 --> 11:27.820
What kind of a jerk
won't even come to the door?

11:36.620 --> 11:40.100
Oh, my God. Casey?

11:40.180 --> 11:42.100
Hey, Pinciotti.

11:43.180 --> 11:46.780
Man, you really
grew into those legs.

11:48.300 --> 11:52.940
Yeah. And you...
Your arms seem bigger.

11:53.020 --> 11:54.940
You...

11:56.620 --> 11:59.700
- So you ready to roll?
- Roll? I'm ready.

12:00.740 --> 12:03.500
We're gonna roll.

12:09.820 --> 12:12.420
Fez, honey,
what are you...

12:12.500 --> 12:14.580
Did you come for cake?

12:18.100 --> 12:20.460
No, I... Do you have cake?

12:22.420 --> 12:27.140
No, no, no. I came... I came here
because I have this... friend.

12:28.220 --> 12:30.580
Oh, really?

12:30.660 --> 12:32.540
What's his name?

12:34.740 --> 12:36.660
Name? Uh...

12:38.580 --> 12:40.900
Johnny...

12:43.100 --> 12:45.580
Table.

12:45.660 --> 12:48.620
And what's
Johnny Table's problem?

12:48.700 --> 12:53.220
Well, he and his girlfriend are about to
do something very special for the first time.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.700
You mean, they're going
to engage in...

12:55.780 --> 12:57.700
Putt-putt.

13:00.980 --> 13:04.780
They are going...
They're going to putt-putt.

13:06.460 --> 13:10.420
And-And-And she has
putted around quite a bit.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.780
But-But he is a virgin,
uh, putter...

13:14.860 --> 13:16.780
a-a virgin putter.

13:19.460 --> 13:23.380
- He has never putted.
- I see.

13:23.460 --> 13:27.060
And my friend, uh...
Ay.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.620
- Johnny Table?
- Yes.

13:29.660 --> 13:32.660
Um, he cannot talk
to Eric or Kelso or Hyde...

13:32.700 --> 13:34.580
because they make fun of me...

13:38.660 --> 13:41.780
him... Johnny...

13:43.260 --> 13:45.660
Table.

13:49.260 --> 13:51.740
So he's coming to you.

13:51.820 --> 13:57.420
Well, honey, you tell Johnny Table
to be respectful...

13:57.500 --> 13:59.380
and wear a condom.

14:02.140 --> 14:05.300
- Thank you, Mrs. Forman. That's good advice.
- Mm-hmm.

14:05.340 --> 14:09.260
- So, um, may I have my piece of cake now?
- Mm-hmm.

14:10.540 --> 14:12.460
And one for Johnny Table.

14:14.780 --> 14:19.380
So when my dad saw that I had broken
the TV with the bowling ball, I said...

14:19.460 --> 14:22.300
"You fix it, dumb-ass."

14:25.660 --> 14:28.020
Ah, it shut him up.

14:28.060 --> 14:31.980
You know, Eric,
I've had a crush on you for so long.

14:32.060 --> 14:34.900
Well, since the paper came out.

14:34.940 --> 14:38.300
Oh, right,
the Most Eligible Viking.

14:38.380 --> 14:41.620
Well, that's just
good reporting.

14:45.020 --> 14:47.060
I can't believe you're Kelso's brother.

14:47.140 --> 14:49.020
I mean,
you're nothing like him.

14:49.060 --> 14:50.940
'Cause he's, like...

14:50.980 --> 14:52.900
And you're all...

14:55.260 --> 14:57.140
- Hey, you want a cold one?
- Okay.

15:00.740 --> 15:02.900
Thanks.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.060
This is fun.

15:06.140 --> 15:09.300
I've been spending, like, way too much time
worrying about my mom and stuff.

15:09.340 --> 15:12.180
Hey, I learned something
in the army.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.020
When things are tough...

15:16.060 --> 15:18.940
turn up the music
and crack open another beer.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.700
Yeah, you mean, like,
things will eventually get better?

15:23.740 --> 15:26.620
I don't know about that. But if they
don't, at least you'll have a beer.

15:30.980 --> 15:32.860
Red, guess what?

15:32.900 --> 15:37.460
I went down to pay for my Corvette, and
some jerk-wad bought it out from under me.

15:37.540 --> 15:41.500
Oh. Well, that's
a tough break, Bob.

15:41.580 --> 15:43.900
But you know what would
make you feel better?

15:51.420 --> 15:53.620
<i>A look at my new Corvette.</i>

15:56.660 --> 15:59.380
Oh, my goodness, it's beautiful.

16:01.980 --> 16:04.180
You bought my car?

16:04.260 --> 16:06.460
That doesn't make me
feel better, Red.

16:06.540 --> 16:09.380
I'm sorry. Did I say
make <i>you</i> feel better?

16:09.460 --> 16:11.620
I meant make <i>me</i>
feel better.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.740
Leo, thanks for letting me
use the Fotohut...

16:17.820 --> 16:20.180
for my date with Rhonda.

16:20.220 --> 16:22.940
And when I say date, I mean...
Do it!

16:26.020 --> 16:29.620
- Hi, Fez.
- Rhonda, you look beautiful.

16:34.220 --> 16:38.180
Well, I'll leave you two with
the same advice my father gave me:

16:38.260 --> 16:40.100
"Get a job, dopehead."

16:44.700 --> 16:47.540
So, here we are.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.700
You know, Fez, I've been
with a lot of guys.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.100
You're more special
than any of them.

16:56.180 --> 16:59.300
Now, I've cleared a space
right over here...

17:00.980 --> 17:04.540
And-And because I care
about you and about us...

17:04.619 --> 17:06.460
I wanna wait.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.380
Wait?

17:16.940 --> 17:19.619
Rhonda, hear me now:
Things are turning blue.

17:27.420 --> 17:30.460
But... But-But, Fez,
I love ya.

17:30.540 --> 17:32.820
But... But!

17:34.020 --> 17:35.900
Oh, I love you too.

17:37.260 --> 17:39.420
- Really?
- Yes, damn it.

17:42.140 --> 17:44.100
So, if you want to wait,
we'll wait.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.740
Ah, come here,
Cocoa Puff.

17:48.180 --> 17:50.540
Yeah, this is nice.

17:50.620 --> 17:53.580
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go sit in the snow.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.980
So, anyway, I just turn
to my dad and I say...

18:05.060 --> 18:08.260
"Yes, I am some sort of wiseass."

18:10.420 --> 18:13.700
Well, shut him up.

18:13.780 --> 18:16.820
Anyway, this was fun.

18:16.900 --> 18:19.540
- Call me?
- Okay.

18:19.620 --> 18:22.060
Hey, Emily!

18:22.140 --> 18:25.300
- On the phone, silly.
- <i>All right.</i>

18:28.580 --> 18:30.500
I am silly.

18:31.580 --> 18:34.500
Hey, Foreplay,
is that you?

18:37.180 --> 18:39.860
"Foreplay."
I forgot about that.

18:40.980 --> 18:44.060
- Come here, little guy.
- Okay, all right.

18:44.140 --> 18:45.980
Okay, all right.
Good to see you.

18:46.060 --> 18:48.340
Okay. Okay, all right.
Okay. Okay.

18:52.260 --> 18:54.180
Man, you haven't
changed a bit.

18:55.460 --> 18:58.060
You still got
that haircut, huh?

19:00.260 --> 19:02.140
No.

19:03.940 --> 19:07.780
So, uh, they let you
out of the army, huh?

19:07.860 --> 19:12.100
Yeah. It was kinda like they were
always tryin' to tell me what to do.

19:13.180 --> 19:15.380
Hey, uh,
Pinciotti tells me...

19:15.420 --> 19:17.460
you and her used to go out,
but you dumped her.

19:17.540 --> 19:21.340
Well, yeah. But it was kind of
complicated with the ring.

19:21.380 --> 19:23.820
- And we talked, but she...
- Yeah, it's a great story.

19:26.260 --> 19:29.540
- Anyhow, I'll see you around, Pinciotti.
- Okay.

19:29.620 --> 19:31.500
You too, Foreplay.

19:33.020 --> 19:34.940
Yeah, okay.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.540
Ooh, Casey Kelso, huh?

19:39.860 --> 19:41.820
Better luck next time.

19:41.900 --> 19:44.460
No, actually, I think I might
go out with him again.

19:44.540 --> 19:46.700
Okay!

19:53.140 --> 19:55.020
What...

19:56.580 --> 19:58.500
Okay.

19:59.740 --> 20:03.940
But, um, I have just
two words for you:

20:04.020 --> 20:05.860
Donna Kelso.

20:07.020 --> 20:08.860
See ya.

20:08.940 --> 20:12.580
What... No! But think
of the children!

20:12.660 --> 20:15.220
Little redheaded morons.

20:17.820 --> 20:21.340
They'd have to go to special schools.
It'd be expensive.

20:27.580 --> 20:29.780
Donna and Casey?

20:35.020 --> 20:37.420
He's a Kelso!

20:40.860 --> 20:43.060
Behold, my friends.

20:43.140 --> 20:46.620
Your lovable foreign exchange
student Fez has done it...

20:48.780 --> 20:50.620
with a woman.

20:54.140 --> 20:56.100
Fine. I'm still a virgin!

20:58.060 --> 20:59.980
You forced it out of me.

21:00.060 --> 21:01.940
Stop looking at me!
