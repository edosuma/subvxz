02:24.811 --> 02:27.710

02:32.744 --> 02:34.710
- A bit nippy.
- Mm.

02:37.345 --> 02:42.911
- It's nice though.
- Aye.

02:42.945 --> 02:45.744
- Do you mind if I sit?
- Oh.

02:45.777 --> 02:47.744
Thanks.

02:53.379 --> 02:55.212
I didn't realize
it was so steep.

02:55.245 --> 02:58.212
Yeah.

02:58.245 --> 03:01.345
This is nice.

03:07.412 --> 03:11.079
(paper crumbling)

03:11.112 --> 03:13.710
- What you got there?
- Oh, jam sandwich.

03:13.744 --> 03:18.312
Oh.

03:18.345 --> 03:20.744
- My brother hates jam.
- Oh.

03:20.777 --> 03:22.379
Yeah.

03:22.412 --> 03:25.145
When we were kids
he once ate a whole jar,

03:25.179 --> 03:27.145
he was sick for two days.

03:27.179 --> 03:30.345
Yeah, two days.

03:30.379 --> 03:33.212
I don't mind it though.

03:38.279 --> 03:41.945
Do you want one?

03:41.978 --> 03:45.212
No, I, um... I, uh...

03:54.777 --> 04:00.777
- Yeah, maybe.
- Oh.

04:00.811 --> 04:02.345
Cheers.

04:02.379 --> 04:06.777
- Cheers.
- Hm.

04:06.811 --> 04:09.811
Mm, yummy.

04:09.845 --> 04:12.345
Yummy.

04:12.379 --> 04:15.677
(birds chirping)

04:23.345 --> 04:26.677
Look, I just want to say
that I'm sorry.

04:26.710 --> 04:28.812
- Pardon?
- You seem quite nice really.

04:28.845 --> 04:31.812
- I didn't think you would be.
- Oh right.

04:31.845 --> 04:34.878
I just hope it sorts
itself out in the end.

04:34.912 --> 04:37.212
I'm sorry, I don't think
I quite understand...

Guh!

04:57.279 --> 05:00.112
Ugh.

05:05.312 --> 05:06.710
I said keep him talking

05:06.744 --> 05:10.710

05:14.710 --> 05:16.912
What is it?

05:16.945 --> 05:19.112
It's jam.

05:19.145 --> 05:22.145

Ilkley Literature Festival.

07:06.812 --> 07:09.778
Now the small towns had some
big speakers this fortnight.

07:09.812 --> 07:11.845
Culminating this Sunday
with the controversial

07:11.878 --> 07:14.279
secularist, Professor Bill...

07:21.212 --> 07:23.245
It's pretty, innit?

07:23.279 --> 07:25.978
It reminds me of Holywell.

07:26.012 --> 07:29.079
You see the bridge?

07:29.112 --> 07:30.312
Shame we didn't come up earlier,

07:30.345 --> 07:31.812
we could've had a wonder.

07:31.845 --> 07:36.112
- See what the festival's about.
- Tim.

07:36.145 --> 07:37.378
Did I do something wrong?

07:37.411 --> 07:39.279
You didn't do anything wrong.

07:39.312 --> 07:42.279
I hope he fucking rots.

07:51.978 --> 07:55.345

08:07.212 --> 08:10.645
Yes, all right!

08:10.678 --> 08:12.745
I didn't realize he was local.

08:12.778 --> 08:14.045
What?

08:14.079 --> 08:16.012
I didn't realize
he was from around here.

08:16.045 --> 08:18.878
He's not from around here,
what are you talking about?

08:18.912 --> 08:20.778
Oh.

08:20.812 --> 08:21.812
He sounded it.

08:21.845 --> 08:25.845

08:25.878 --> 08:27.344
What?

08:27.378 --> 08:31.344

08:38.678 --> 08:39.778
How?
How?

08:39.812 --> 08:42.179
I don't know, I saw him
coming out the hotel and...

08:42.212 --> 08:44.311
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

08:44.344 --> 08:45.978
It looked just
like him from behind.

08:46.012 --> 08:48.645
Yeah but everybody looks
like everybody from behind!

08:48.678 --> 08:49.745
No, not necessarily.

08:49.778 --> 08:51.611

We're still here.

09:11.678 --> 09:14.778
Well, I...

09:46.411 --> 09:49.878
- What did he...
- We're staying.

09:49.912 --> 09:53.912
- I thought the plan was...
- The plan's changed.

09:53.945 --> 09:56.978
Is he upset?

09:57.012 --> 09:59.179
We'll check into a hotel.

09:59.212 --> 10:02.711
And then what?

10:02.745 --> 10:03.745
Uh and then nothing.

10:03.778 --> 10:06.845
We wait.

10:06.878 --> 10:10.812
He's coming here?

10:10.845 --> 10:15.344
No.

10:15.378 --> 10:18.378
- No, no, no.
- It's fine, it's fine.

10:18.411 --> 10:20.079
It's fine, honestly, honestly.

10:20.112 --> 10:21.812

10:58.012 --> 10:59.878
All right, I'll take that side.

10:59.912 --> 11:01.711
No, I want that one.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.112
Sure.

11:11.344 --> 11:13.611
Forgot my fucking beads.

doesn't it?

11:32.178 --> 11:34.311

Well, it's safe to say

11:49.678 --> 11:50.611
you certainly rustled
some feathers.

11:50.645 --> 11:53.611
Have I? Whew, I thought
I was losing my touch.

11:53.645 --> 11:55.344
And you really can't understand

11:55.379 --> 11:57.079
why your book is offending
so many people?

11:57.111 --> 11:58.144
Oh sure, I can understand it

11:58.178 --> 12:00.012
but that doesn't mean to say
I have to care.

12:00.045 --> 12:02.344
I mean, I'm offended every day

12:02.379 --> 12:04.812
by the dogma pedaled
in churches and mosques

12:04.845 --> 12:06.611
up and down the country
but you don't see me

12:06.645 --> 12:07.645
issuing Fatwas

12:07.678 --> 12:09.045
or burning effigies of Christ.

12:09.079 --> 12:10.344
Yes, but the point is...

12:10.379 --> 12:13.778
The point is this,
my book deals with facts.

12:13.812 --> 12:15.278
With rational thought.

12:15.311 --> 12:17.379
Now if that makes people
so insecure

12:17.412 --> 12:19.845
about their supposedly
omnipotent God

12:19.878 --> 12:21.845

15:43.977 --> 15:47.645
What the fuck did you just say?

15:47.678 --> 15:51.145
- Going to bed.

16:04.412 --> 16:10.011
A definition of heroism that
(indistinct speaking).

16:10.044 --> 16:12.812
So how do we begin to grapple

16:12.845 --> 16:14.011
with this notion of heroinism?

16:14.044 --> 16:17.145
What makes our heroes heroic?

16:17.179 --> 16:20.844
Is it success or final victory?

16:20.877 --> 16:23.044
Not necessarily.

16:23.078 --> 16:25.611
Oedipus was the greatest king
that thieves had ever seen.

16:25.645 --> 16:27.345
Until he wasn't.

16:27.379 --> 16:29.911
So perhaps then,
heroism lurks somewhere

16:29.944 --> 16:33.245
between parallelities,
between good and evil.

16:33.279 --> 16:36.145

Bring it down then, Frank.

17:38.045 --> 17:41.312
I'm not a fucking Sherpa,
fuck's sake.

17:41.345 --> 17:43.312
Hiking really is a wanker's
pastime, isn't it?

17:43.345 --> 17:45.877
That said, our wanker
looks like he came prepared.

17:45.911 --> 17:48.911
Pricy boots, nice waterproof.

17:48.944 --> 17:51.678
Can't see an experienced
walker tumbling 30 feet

17:51.711 --> 17:52.877
just 'cause
the weather picks up.

17:52.911 --> 17:54.844
- Suicide's an option.
- Perhaps.

17:54.877 --> 17:56.711
Here ma'am.

17:56.745 --> 17:58.379
We found it under a bench.

17:58.412 --> 18:00.012
- Hi, Millie.
- Hiyya.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.645
Frank, if you want to stick
your dick in something

18:01.678 --> 18:04.744
- talk to the corpse.
- Yes, ma'am.

18:04.777 --> 18:07.012
- It looks like a bracelet....
- Shut it, Frank.

18:07.045 --> 18:10.212
Ma'am, have you seen
the bruising around his neck?

18:10.245 --> 18:12.312
Oh.

18:14.744 --> 18:17.312

- Fine.

18:56.112 --> 19:00.645
Yeah, it took me ages
to nod off.

19:00.678 --> 19:02.678
You don't think they'll be
looking for us, do you?

19:02.710 --> 19:05.710
- Who?
- I don't know, the police.

19:05.744 --> 19:07.877
Keep your fucking voice down,
will yah?

19:07.911 --> 19:11.312
Sorry.

19:16.345 --> 19:17.744
I don't want to go to prison.

19:17.777 --> 19:20.744
We're not going to prison,
shut up.

19:20.777 --> 19:24.179
Anyway, even if we did, so what?

19:24.212 --> 19:27.179
Loads of saints went to prison,
didn't do them any harm, did it.

19:27.212 --> 19:29.079
Some twat blows himself up,

19:29.112 --> 19:31.045
gets himself on the front
of every fucking paper,

19:31.079 --> 19:33.844
maybe it's our turn, ey.

19:33.877 --> 19:37.611
They don't love God
anymore than we do, do they?

19:37.645 --> 19:40.012
- No.
- No, so...

19:40.045 --> 19:42.045
if we do go to prison
and I'm not saying we will

19:42.079 --> 19:43.677
because we won't,

19:43.710 --> 19:45.811
but if we did

19:45.844 --> 19:49.912
we'd be martyrs, proper ones.

19:49.945 --> 19:51.945
There you go, see.

19:51.978 --> 19:55.777
Stop thinking so much,
all right.

19:55.811 --> 19:58.212
Good.

20:01.312 --> 20:03.710
Now...

20:03.744 --> 20:06.878
Should we go and watch cartoons?

20:06.912 --> 20:08.710
What?

20:08.744 --> 20:10.710
I just thought maybe we could
have a wander around town.

20:10.744 --> 20:13.379
- Why?
- Just for a bit, you know.

20:13.412 --> 20:14.912
I don't think it's a good idea.

20:14.945 --> 20:17.710
This place doesn't seem
that bad.

20:17.744 --> 20:24.045
Even Southam has good bits.

20:24.079 --> 20:25.777
All right fine, you go.

20:25.811 --> 20:27.978
Just for a bit, oi, listen.

20:28.012 --> 20:29.878
Be careful, yeah?

- Is it?

21:26.878 --> 21:28.978
Uh, you were talking
at the hotel last night.

21:29.012 --> 21:30.777
Oh God yeah, it is me.

21:30.812 --> 21:32.179
Sorry, I hope it

21:37.744 --> 21:39.845
Oh?

21:41.812 --> 21:44.145
Anyway, nice of you to say hi,
I better...

21:44.179 --> 21:46.312
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

21:46.345 --> 21:48.912
And who's Milton?

21:48.945 --> 21:50.379
Sorry?

21:50.412 --> 21:52.812
You were talking about
Milton last night.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.212
- About Satan.
- John Milton

21:55.245 --> 21:56.912
and yeah, he's...

21:56.945 --> 21:59.045
He wrote Paradise Lost.

21:59.079 --> 22:01.945
It's a very long poem
about the Bible.

22:01.978 --> 22:04.845
Satan's the good guy,
well sort of.

22:04.878 --> 22:07.978
Well then what about God?

22:08.012 --> 22:11.778
God is kind of like
a judgmental dad.

22:11.812 --> 22:15.312
Constantly shooting down
everyone's party.

22:15.345 --> 22:17.812
That sounds a bit
like my brother.

22:17.845 --> 22:21.677
- Does it?
- Yeah.

22:21.710 --> 22:25.012
So who else are you here to see
other than me, obviously.

22:25.045 --> 22:27.945
Oh, I'm thinking of seeing this.

22:27.978 --> 22:30.610
You... you know,
I think that's for kids.

22:30.644 --> 22:33.312
Oh, right, oops.

22:33.345 --> 22:35.644
But you know,
it's all good stuff.

22:35.677 --> 22:37.644
Do you want to come?

22:37.677 --> 22:39.812
You know what, normally I would

22:39.845 --> 22:41.045
but I'm just about
to meet a friend.

22:41.079 --> 22:43.045
Oh sure, no worries, okiedokie.

22:43.079 --> 22:44.711
But I hope you enjoy it.

22:44.745 --> 22:46.945
Thanks.

22:46.978 --> 22:51.945
- Bye then.
- Bye.

22:51.978 --> 22:55.312
(phone dinging)

22:58.145 --> 22:59.845
Hey!

22:59.878 --> 23:02.644
Hey, hold on!

23:13.179 --> 23:14.978
Why you reading that?

23:15.012 --> 23:18.179
Uh, you hadn't said anything
in about eight minutes.

23:18.212 --> 23:23.912
No, why you reading that.

23:23.945 --> 23:27.345
Wanted to see
what all the fuss was about.

23:27.379 --> 23:28.912
Just another jumped up
cocker

23:28.945 --> 23:31.978
thinks the world's waiting
for his opinion.

23:32.012 --> 23:35.845
I said it before, do you know
what I'm gonna say it again.

23:35.878 --> 23:39.079
This festival brings out
the twats like nothing else.

23:39.112 --> 23:41.745
And you're sure
there's a connection?

23:41.778 --> 23:43.644
What, a perfectly ordinary
bloke?

23:43.678 --> 23:45.978
No debts, no dirty habits,
loving wife.

23:46.012 --> 23:47.912
It's tossed off a bluff,
the only weekend this place

23:47.945 --> 23:49.379
means anything to anyone.

23:49.411 --> 23:53.345
Yes, I think it might be
a fat old coincidence.

23:53.379 --> 23:55.610
It's possible.

23:55.645 --> 23:56.745
Jesus.

23:56.778 --> 23:59.245
God, you sound like
my therapist.

23:59.279 --> 24:01.912
Praise be, here he comes.

24:01.945 --> 24:03.912
Locked off.

24:03.945 --> 24:05.778
- Morning Martin.
- Oh Christ.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.878
Before you ask,
yes I did get your messages

24:07.912 --> 24:09.645
and no, I don't have time
to talk about it

24:09.678 --> 24:10.511
because if you hadn't noticed

24:10.545 --> 24:12.378
I'm trying to run
a festival here.

24:12.411 --> 24:14.012
- This is CI Hodge.
- Yes, I know.

24:14.045 --> 24:15.711
Millie used to babysit
my daughter, hello Millie.

24:15.745 --> 24:17.378
Hi, Mr. Silver,
how's it all going?

24:17.411 --> 24:18.778
Getting there,
your mom's been a great help

24:18.812 --> 24:20.345
sorting out that bunting,
you see,

24:20.378 --> 24:21.978
you forget that you're the
only person in Ilkley

24:22.012 --> 24:24.245
who somehow manages
not to know anyone.

24:24.279 --> 24:25.878
- Boohoo.
- You gonna invite us in?

24:25.912 --> 24:28.279
No.

24:34.212 --> 24:38.212
(cartoon noises)

24:42.711 --> 24:44.912
"Peter's mother put her
arm around him suddenly

24:44.945 --> 24:47.645
and hugged him in silence
for a minute

24:47.678 --> 24:50.978
then she said, 'Don't
you think it's rather nice

24:51.012 --> 24:53.645
to think that we're in
a book that's God's writing?

24:53.678 --> 24:55.212
If I were writing the book

24:55.245 --> 24:57.312
I might make mistakes.

24:57.344 --> 25:00.279
But God knows how to make
the story end just right,

25:00.312 --> 25:02.812
in a way that's best for us.'

25:02.845 --> 25:04.845
'Do you really believe that,
mother?'

25:04.878 --> 25:06.778
Peter asked quietly.

25:06.812 --> 25:09.745
'Yes, she said,
I do believe it."

25:09.778 --> 25:17.079
♪ ♪

25:19.079 --> 25:20.778
You think you'll
ever write a book?

25:20.812 --> 25:24.611
Oh, I have, unfortunately,
no one wanted to publish it.

25:24.645 --> 25:26.611
You can stand on the edges
in this job

25:26.645 --> 25:29.378
but if your name's not on
the list you're not getting in.

25:29.411 --> 25:31.179
Yeah.

25:31.212 --> 25:33.079
When I was 15,

25:33.112 --> 25:35.711
Bobby Roads wouldn't let me
play in his treehouse.

25:35.745 --> 25:37.711
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

25:37.745 --> 25:38.978
How did that work out?

25:39.012 --> 25:40.945
Well, my brother broke his nose.

25:40.978 --> 25:46.212
Oh, you're not the average
festival goer, are you, Tim?

25:46.245 --> 25:47.611

25:47.645 --> 25:48.978

25:49.012 --> 25:53.012
you don't exactly fit the type.

25:53.045 --> 25:54.878
What you really doing here?

25:54.912 --> 25:57.845
I'm just... I'm you know.

25:57.878 --> 26:00.945
I'm only teasing,
why shouldn't you be here.

26:00.978 --> 26:02.945
We're all stories in the end,

26:02.978 --> 26:05.179
as my dad would say.

26:05.212 --> 26:08.778
That's why we tell them.

26:08.812 --> 26:10.912
Wow.

26:10.945 --> 26:12.745
Oh, that is fantastic Margaret.

26:12.778 --> 26:16.378
Yes, we will make sure
they're still and sparkling.

26:16.411 --> 26:18.179
All right, yes,
looking forward to it.

26:18.212 --> 26:20.112
Okay, take care bye-bye now.

26:20.145 --> 26:22.378
Bye, bye-bye.

26:22.411 --> 26:24.179
(indistinct) you do
tricks as well?

26:24.212 --> 26:26.145
Only for the Nobel winners.

26:26.179 --> 26:27.845
What do you want?

26:27.878 --> 26:29.311
Okay, right,
well I want suspension

26:29.344 --> 26:32.244
of all festival events
for the next 48 hours.

26:32.278 --> 26:34.378
You are joking.

26:34.411 --> 26:37.045
It's the final weekend, Louise.

26:37.079 --> 26:39.945
I mean, it's the biggest weekend
in the bloody calendar.

26:39.978 --> 26:41.812
Yes, Martin and there's been
a bloody murder

26:41.845 --> 26:43.678
less than a bloody mile away.

26:43.711 --> 26:46.678
And... and the family has my
deepest sympathies, they do.

26:46.711 --> 26:49.311
But I really don't see
what that has to do with us

26:49.344 --> 26:52.145
unless the police want
to start deputizing novelists.

26:52.179 --> 26:53.179
Don't be a smartass, Martin

26:53.211 --> 26:54.878
or I'll twat you in the throat.

26:54.912 --> 26:56.745
But the reality is we got
24 hours to find our man

26:56.778 --> 26:58.344
before our odds
become considerably slimmer.

26:58.378 --> 27:00.378
So it'd really help our lives

27:00.411 --> 27:03.678
if we didn't have a fucking
carnival going on around us.

27:03.711 --> 27:05.745
You need a holiday, Louise.

27:05.778 --> 27:07.012
Get out of Yorkshire.

27:07.045 --> 27:09.311
Okay, all right,
if that's how you feel, Martin.

27:09.344 --> 27:11.945
Hey, hey, perhaps Helen
would like to know

27:11.978 --> 27:15.745
about this waiter you've been
going around with.

27:15.778 --> 27:17.678
Italian, isn't he?

27:17.711 --> 27:19.878
Very exotic.

27:19.912 --> 27:23.812
Louise, Helen and I have been
amicably separated

27:23.845 --> 27:28.079
for two years,
Enrico is my fiancé.

27:28.112 --> 27:31.079
Look, I know this weekend
means nothing to you, yeah.

27:31.112 --> 27:34.912
But it's our single largest
tourism boost of the year.

27:34.945 --> 27:37.378
I've seen jaws, Louise,

27:37.411 --> 27:38.745
Don't make me the mayor.

27:38.778 --> 27:41.812
John Martin,
I've seen Jaws as well.

27:41.845 --> 27:43.778
I am fucking Jaws

27:43.812 --> 27:44.878
and you are this far away

27:44.912 --> 27:49.145
from getting slapped
by my fish dick.

27:49.178 --> 27:51.745
(banging)

27:53.745 --> 27:55.645
Congratulations on your wedding,
Mr. Silver.

27:55.678 --> 27:57.711
Oh, thank you Millie, thank you.

27:57.745 --> 28:01.211
Oh and regards to your mother,
I hope she's doing okay.

28:04.311 --> 28:06.244
Fish stick.

28:06.278 --> 28:10.611
Fish stick.

28:10.645 --> 28:11.912
- What now?
- Follow him home.

28:11.945 --> 28:14.778
Piles of shit
through his letterbox.

28:14.812 --> 28:16.778
How about some breakfast?

28:16.812 --> 28:19.344
Fine.

28:20.379 --> 28:21.311
I'm really ruling at it,

28:21.344 --> 28:24.278
the golden age
of children's literature.

28:24.311 --> 28:27.912
Right, I see.

28:27.945 --> 28:30.678
(church bell dinging)

28:30.711 --> 28:32.812
- I've got to go.
- Oh, okay.

28:32.845 --> 28:37.079
Um, it was nice meeting you,
Imelda.

28:37.111 --> 28:39.311
It was nice meeting you too,
Tim.

28:39.344 --> 28:40.745
Bye.

28:40.778 --> 28:42.912
Oh, there's an
end of the fest party

28:42.945 --> 28:45.079
- at The Banister tonight.
- Okay.

28:45.111 --> 28:46.678

30:15.645 --> 30:17.379
Right, what can I get for you,
love?

30:17.412 --> 30:19.611
- Oh, no I think...

30:29.845 --> 30:31.345
Nothing yet.

30:37.778 --> 30:40.011
I don't know who would do
something like that.

30:40.044 --> 30:42.312
- It's awful.
- Whoever it is, we'll get them.

and let them rot.

Oh, that won't be necessary

he might sign your tits.

Good Timothy, very good.

35:59.744 --> 36:02.744
At the talk, yes.

36:02.777 --> 36:05.345
I think that's
an excellent idea.

36:05.379 --> 36:09.312
Why not let the world see
God's wrath made plain.

36:09.345 --> 36:12.045
- But then...
- What?

36:12.079 --> 36:16.744
Then how would we get away
without everyone seeing us?

36:16.777 --> 36:19.644
Oh.

36:22.844 --> 36:25.145
I remember the day
I took you in.

a basket, did you.

For our love.

36:48.245 --> 36:51.978
For your love, yes.

36:52.012 --> 36:55.245
But love won't sacrifice,

36:55.279 --> 36:58.744
not just obedience, Timothy.

36:58.777 --> 37:02.912
You won't forsake me now,
will you?

37:02.945 --> 37:07.245
You'll be a good boy, yes.

37:09.245 --> 37:12.610
Splendid.

37:12.644 --> 37:15.777

making arrangements

I wanted to tell him
I was sorry.

52:19.777 --> 52:24.212
Tell him it was a mistake,
because...

Didn't he look
just like Dad.

Hey.

01:19:31.012 --> 01:19:32.078
Two weeks on, Father,

01:19:32.111 --> 01:19:34.945
what's the mood been like
for you in the parish?

01:19:34.978 --> 01:19:39.912
Well, as I said,
we're in shock, deep shock.

01:19:39.945 --> 01:19:42.012
We saw no signs
of the disturbance

01:19:42.044 --> 01:19:43.878
of those boys.

01:19:43.912 --> 01:19:45.812
No warning.

01:19:45.845 --> 01:19:48.678
We just wish
we could have done more.

01:19:48.711 --> 01:19:51.012
And what about those
suggesting some link

01:19:51.044 --> 01:19:52.078
between the church and...

01:19:52.111 --> 01:19:55.078
Oh, absolutely not, no.

01:19:55.111 --> 01:19:56.312
(chuckles)

01:19:56.345 --> 01:19:58.279
No, an ill mind
is an ill mind.

01:19:58.312 --> 01:20:00.711
There's nothing Christian
about it.

01:20:00.745 --> 01:20:03.912
I mean, put it like this.

01:20:03.945 --> 01:20:05.878
Parishioners are coming back
to the church

01:20:05.912 --> 01:20:08.945
who haven't attended
for 20 years,

01:20:08.978 --> 01:20:11.312
and that's because,
at moments like this,

01:20:11.345 --> 01:20:14.044
there is nothing
more powerful

01:20:14.078 --> 01:20:18.678
than community
and Christian love.

01:20:18.711 --> 01:20:20.745
Professor,
care to add anything?

01:20:22.645 --> 01:20:24.078
No, I'm... I'm not gonna bite.

01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:26.111
This is hardly the time.

01:20:26.144 --> 01:20:31.945
But I would just add
that I feel oddly grateful

01:20:31.978 --> 01:20:33.044
for the experience.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:36.778
I mean, I hug my kids
a little tighter each night.

01:20:36.812 --> 01:20:39.778
I... I kiss my wife
a little more often.

01:20:39.812 --> 01:20:41.778
Is this a softer side
to Professor Huxley

01:20:41.812 --> 01:20:44.878
that will be evidenced
in future work?

01:20:44.912 --> 01:20:47.912
Look, both Enoch and I

01:20:47.945 --> 01:20:50.945
might seem
somewhat divisive figures.

01:20:50.977 --> 01:20:52.845
I mean, we'd hardly share
a platform like this

01:20:52.878 --> 01:20:54.345
in the normal course
of events.

01:20:54.379 --> 01:20:56.678
But we both
vehemently reject

01:20:56.711 --> 01:20:59.645
the terrorism
embraced by these young men,

01:20:59.678 --> 01:21:02.044
particularly
in this day and age.

01:21:02.078 --> 01:21:03.745
We understand
the importance

01:21:03.778 --> 01:21:05.878
of putting aside
our differences

01:21:05.912 --> 01:21:08.977
at a time when common humanity
must come to the fore.

01:21:09.011 --> 01:21:10.778
Amen.

01:21:10.812 --> 01:21:11.878
Professor Huxley,
Father Enoch,

01:21:11.912 --> 01:21:13.044
thank you very much.

01:21:13.078 --> 01:21:14.078
You'll be
sticking around

01:21:14.111 --> 01:21:15.379
for a look
at tomorrow's headlines.

01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:17.912
Oh, we're not going anywhere.

01:21:17.944 --> 01:21:19.944
Fantastic.

01:21:19.977 --> 01:21:22.745
Back now to the suspected
terror attack in Rome.

01:21:22.778 --> 01:21:24.912
