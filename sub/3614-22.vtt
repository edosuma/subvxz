00:03.169 --> 00:05.478
The Council will remind you
of the heavy losses

00:05.649 --> 00:08.004
emanating from this San Francisco.

00:08.169 --> 00:10.478
From what we have learned,

00:10.649 --> 00:15.598
all of the witches there
have been charmed.

00:15.769 --> 00:19.444
I descend from a long
line of Dragon warlocks.

00:19.609 --> 00:22.248
When my father died,
he left me two things:

00:22.409 --> 00:24.161
The power of flight,

00:24.329 --> 00:28.641
and the passionate hatred
for those who killed him, witches.

00:28.809 --> 00:32.563
And I will not rest until
I put all witches to rest.

00:32.729 --> 00:35.323
The Council is intrigued.

00:35.529 --> 00:42.446
However, all who have used force
on these witches before have failed.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.759
There is another way.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

00:56.569 --> 00:59.288
A genie? You can't be serious.

00:59.489 --> 01:01.559
Tell them what you told me.

01:02.969 --> 01:07.565
Well, actually, that was kind of a
just-between-you-and-me thing.

01:07.729 --> 01:10.368
- Tell it!
- All right.

01:10.849 --> 01:15.525
Well, personally, I think
that the best way to destroy witches

01:15.689 --> 01:18.999
is not to treat them
like witches at all.

01:19.169 --> 01:21.524
You treat them like humans.

01:21.729 --> 01:24.004
Most of your evildoers,
naughty types,

01:24.169 --> 01:27.320
think it's best to deprive
humans of what they desire.

01:27.489 --> 01:31.084
No. You want to get them,
you give them exactly what they desire.

01:31.249 --> 01:35.481
You grant them their wishes,
it'll lead to their undoing.

01:35.649 --> 01:39.039
We don't know that. He's a genie!

01:39.209 --> 01:41.564
If Council agrees,
how do we proceed?

01:41.929 --> 01:46.878
Well, just make sure that the bottle
cross paths with the witches

01:47.049 --> 01:50.359
and let El Genie Grande
take it from there.

01:50.609 --> 01:53.681
With all due respect,
genies only work for themselves.

01:53.889 --> 01:56.722
If he grants them three wishes,
he goes free.

01:57.129 --> 01:59.165
How do you know
that he won't betray you?

01:59.329 --> 02:05.086
Remember, getting your freedom
does not make you free from us.

02:05.329 --> 02:09.241
As long as you are a genie,
we can find you anytime.

02:10.649 --> 02:12.924
Anywhere.

02:16.449 --> 02:17.564
Check my to-do list.

02:17.729 --> 02:19.799
It says "bank, dry cleaners,
pedicure."

02:19.969 --> 02:22.608
Nowhere on the list
does it say "kick-box a beast."

02:22.809 --> 02:25.403
Just walking along, minding my
own business, and wham!

02:25.569 --> 02:29.198
It was like a random attack.
A demonic drive-by.

02:29.729 --> 02:31.959
Nothing in our lives
is random anymore.

02:32.169 --> 02:35.320
You know, we keep saying that,
but what does it really mean?

02:35.729 --> 02:38.197
Is there some kind
of cosmic order to all this?

02:38.369 --> 02:41.281
Are we on some kind of list? And if so,
how many points are we worth?

02:41.649 --> 02:42.923
- Phoebe...
- What?

02:43.089 --> 02:45.478
We've had a great year.
We've wiped out a ton of nasties.

02:45.649 --> 02:50.484
I just want to know if we've tripped
some supernatural alarm or anything.

02:52.689 --> 02:54.919
And are we ever gonna
learn what it really means?

02:55.089 --> 02:57.887
Well, not to sound
all whitelightery,

02:58.049 --> 02:59.641
but everything happens
in its own time.

02:59.809 --> 03:01.879
You know, you can't rush
what's to be.

03:02.329 --> 03:05.719
Okay, how about what already is?
Dan is back in town.

03:06.049 --> 03:08.358
- So?
- So, what am I gonna tell him?

03:08.649 --> 03:09.968
The last time I saw him,

03:10.129 --> 03:11.960
he handed me proof
that you were killed in 1942.

03:12.129 --> 03:13.562
He's gonna expect
a reaction from me.

03:13.769 --> 03:16.283
How about, "Hey, Dan, you're right.
I am a necrophiliac."

03:16.449 --> 03:17.848
Phoebe.

03:18.009 --> 03:20.648
Why does everyone always
"Phoebe" me?

03:21.329 --> 03:23.684
- Hey.
- Where are you off to?

03:24.409 --> 03:26.718
- Lunch date with Dick.
- Dull Dick?

03:27.289 --> 03:29.280
Prue, you are too hot
to have to duty date.

03:29.449 --> 03:31.121
Yeah, well, all demon-hunting
and no play

03:31.289 --> 03:32.563
has made me a lot less picky.

03:32.729 --> 03:35.163
I gotta figure out a way to put
some more balance in my life.

03:35.529 --> 03:37.087
Yeah, but you don't need Dick.

03:40.929 --> 03:45.081
What I mean is, you should be excited
to see the guy you're dating.

03:45.249 --> 03:47.160
You look like you're off
to the Inquisition.

03:47.369 --> 03:48.927
It's not that bad.

03:49.209 --> 03:50.688
Okay, I have to go open the club.

03:50.889 --> 03:52.288
Are you gonna be all right, Pheebs?

03:52.449 --> 03:54.519
Yes, and I think I'm... Thanks, Leo.

03:54.689 --> 03:57.249
I'm gonna take a walk
and try to loosen up my ankle.

04:02.929 --> 04:04.442
What is that?

04:04.609 --> 04:08.158
- I don't know.
- Somebody got a secret admirer?

04:08.329 --> 04:12.163
It's so dusty. Who would send us
something so dusty?

04:23.089 --> 04:25.842
Your wish is my command.

06:00.929 --> 06:01.964
I don't get it.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.085
You've been stuck in
that bottle for 200 years,

06:04.249 --> 06:05.682
someone finally sends you to us,

06:05.849 --> 06:07.441
and you have no idea
who licked the stamp?

06:07.609 --> 06:09.247
I kind of find that hard to believe.

06:09.529 --> 06:12.601
What, and a genie man standing
in our living room, wearing that,

06:12.769 --> 06:14.646
offering to grant us
each a wish isn't?

06:15.529 --> 06:17.008
Well, I don't get it.

06:17.169 --> 06:20.445
You win the lotto
and you're asking for explanations?

06:20.689 --> 06:23.408
Actually we'd just like to know
who to send the thank-you note to.

06:23.609 --> 06:27.318
All I know is that you rubbed!

06:27.769 --> 06:29.248
And now I serve.

06:30.769 --> 06:32.566
Look at that.

06:34.249 --> 06:35.477
Snacks.

06:38.249 --> 06:41.127
What I wouldn't give
to taste food just once.

06:42.409 --> 06:43.808
Smell it even.

06:45.809 --> 06:49.324
I don't trust him.
Genies are tricksters by nature.

06:49.529 --> 06:51.963
They can and will do anything
just to be freed.

06:52.929 --> 06:55.397
What are you, the butler? Come on!

06:55.609 --> 06:57.042
Everybody's got wishes.

06:57.249 --> 06:59.080
I mean, most people spend
their entire lives

06:59.249 --> 07:02.286
with their wishes never coming true.
Here's your chance.

07:02.649 --> 07:03.968
No way is this legit.

07:04.129 --> 07:06.563
Oh, you don't think so?
Well, I'll tell you what is.

07:06.929 --> 07:10.763
I stay until I grant three wishes.
One from each of you.

07:10.969 --> 07:14.484
Those are the rules.
No wishes, permanent houseguest.

07:14.729 --> 07:17.801
And I snore. I make phone calls
I can't even pay for.

07:18.009 --> 07:20.967
You think I'm gonna be putting the
CDs back in the right case? No.

07:21.169 --> 07:22.966
All right, talk amongst yourselves.

07:23.169 --> 07:24.443
I'll be over here, all right?

07:24.609 --> 07:27.840
I have a hunch that I'm going
to be here for a while.

07:28.009 --> 07:30.079
This is a nice house.

07:35.529 --> 07:37.008
He's enjoying this.

07:37.169 --> 07:39.399
All right, Leo, what else
do you know about genies?

07:39.569 --> 07:42.322
Well, one good thing is
they're not evil by nature.

07:42.929 --> 07:45.841
I mean, they can't harm you
unless you wish for something.

07:46.129 --> 07:48.040
Well, I mean, what is so dangerous
about a wish?

07:48.209 --> 07:52.680
Well, with genies, there's always
a catch, an unseen consequence.

07:52.849 --> 07:55.522
For example,
say a man wishes for a car.

07:55.689 --> 07:59.568
The next day, his dad will die,
and he'll inherit a car.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.526
So as long as we don't wish...?

08:01.689 --> 08:03.008
You're free and clear.

08:03.169 --> 08:05.205
Clear enough to make a lunch date?

08:05.369 --> 08:08.042
If what Leo says goes,
you two go on ahead.

08:08.249 --> 08:11.161
Leave the genie with the cripple.
I'm not really in a wishing mood.

08:11.329 --> 08:12.444
Thank you, gimp.

08:12.609 --> 08:14.361
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'll look through the Book

08:14.529 --> 08:16.679
and see if we could UPS him
back to where he came from.

08:17.049 --> 08:18.368
All right.

08:20.369 --> 08:23.884
So, what's it gonna be, master?

08:26.449 --> 08:30.647
So have you been here before?

08:30.849 --> 08:35.445
It's close to the office.
I don't like to take long lunches.

08:36.688 --> 08:39.361
What's good?

08:39.529 --> 08:40.928
The Caesar's fine.

08:42.369 --> 08:45.805
The pasta's fine.
The fish is fine.

08:46.049 --> 08:47.721
- Steak is...
- Fine.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.238
Yeah, actually.
How'd you know?

08:51.409 --> 08:54.003
Wild guess.

08:55.689 --> 08:57.008
What have I gotten myself into?

08:58.089 --> 08:59.647
Hey, Dick.

09:03.769 --> 09:05.999
Don't you just love butter?

09:06.169 --> 09:08.763
Creamy goodness.
To your health.

09:12.129 --> 09:13.118
Dick, are you...?

09:13.289 --> 09:14.961
Sick and tired of trying
to pass myself off

09:15.129 --> 09:18.485
as even being halfway worthy
of dating you? You betcha!

09:18.649 --> 09:20.844
Look, you and I both know
I'm dull as mud.

09:21.049 --> 09:23.438
I can't help it. I know who I am.

09:23.609 --> 09:25.645
I know I'm not the guy
you're looking for.

09:25.809 --> 09:26.798
I...

09:26.969 --> 09:29.563
The question is,
what are you looking for?

09:29.769 --> 09:30.804
I mean, come on.

09:30.969 --> 09:33.961
How do we make it to date three
when you really know I'm not the guy?

09:34.689 --> 09:36.520
It's...

09:37.929 --> 09:38.998
I don't know.

09:41.929 --> 09:46.002
You know, I mean,
at this point, I just...

09:46.169 --> 09:48.729
...feel like dating is kind of a job,
you know.

09:48.889 --> 09:53.007
I mean, you get numb, but you feel like
it's your duty to stay out there.

09:54.609 --> 09:57.077
I just want to feel excited
by love again.

09:59.649 --> 10:02.641
I wish it was like it was the first time.

10:05.569 --> 10:08.447
Your wish, my command.

10:19.609 --> 10:23.318
Hi. How about great fortune?
You want that?

10:23.529 --> 10:25.565
- After taxes, not worth it.
- No?

10:25.729 --> 10:30.280
- Land? Power? Beauty?
- Nope.

10:30.889 --> 10:33.528
- Okay, who am I kidding.
- Why are you not in this book?

10:33.729 --> 10:36.721
Because the only way to get rid of me
is to make three wishes.

10:37.329 --> 10:40.241
Come on! Large or small.
I do all kinds.

10:40.449 --> 10:42.963
Only no world peace. I can't do that.

10:43.129 --> 10:46.166
The fine print of wishing.
Your job has its limitations.

10:46.369 --> 10:47.848
Yeah, well, so does yours.

10:49.409 --> 10:51.286
Occupational hazard.

10:51.489 --> 10:52.763
Doesn't have to be.

10:53.409 --> 10:56.526
You could wish to be
as powerful as you want.

10:58.329 --> 11:01.526
Nope. Nope.
I am not interested in that.

11:01.689 --> 11:05.398
Oh, "not interested."
Not interested in absolute power.

11:05.649 --> 11:08.368
You're a rocket scientist.

11:11.329 --> 11:12.808
I mean, poor Dan.

11:12.969 --> 11:15.722
It would just be so much easier
if I could be honest with him.

11:15.889 --> 11:18.244
But other than saying,
"Leo is a whitelighter,"

11:18.409 --> 11:19.728
what am I gonna tell him?

11:19.929 --> 11:21.521
Well, what more does
he need to know?

11:22.169 --> 11:25.479
Well, maybe it's about
what I need to know.

11:26.289 --> 11:28.564
I mean, you've been watching me
my whole life,

11:28.729 --> 11:31.038
and I don't even know
where you spend yours.

11:31.449 --> 11:33.201
If there's anything
you want to know...

11:33.369 --> 11:36.600
It's not exactly about knowing,
it's more about experiencing,

11:36.769 --> 11:38.725
and experiencing it with you.

11:38.929 --> 11:42.126
I mean, I have no idea where you go
when you orb out.

11:42.289 --> 11:45.406
Do you have a house?
Friends? A CD player?

11:45.609 --> 11:47.600
It's not really like that.

11:51.009 --> 11:53.443
- Dan.
- You've got to be kidding me.

11:58.289 --> 11:59.563
Wait.

11:59.729 --> 12:02.323
I think it's time we talked.

12:03.249 --> 12:06.286
I don't think there's anything
to talk about, Piper.

12:06.489 --> 12:08.002
It's your life.

12:09.089 --> 12:11.728
Leo, can you give us
a second, please?

12:11.889 --> 12:14.119
Yeah, yeah.

12:19.409 --> 12:21.798
What do you expect from me?
I'd really like to know.

12:21.969 --> 12:24.085
At this point, I don't know what
to expect from you.

12:24.289 --> 12:27.247
I mean, how can you be with this guy
after everything I found out about him?

12:27.409 --> 12:28.603
He's a fraud.

12:28.769 --> 12:31.408
Dan, I know who Leo is.
I always have.

12:32.129 --> 12:33.164
What?

12:33.369 --> 12:35.280
It's not that I don't appreciate
everything you...

12:35.449 --> 12:38.441
Wait. I've spent all this time
worrying about you,

12:38.969 --> 12:41.244
worrying about who he is...

12:42.049 --> 12:44.040
...and you've known all along?

12:44.209 --> 12:46.165
Well, it's...

12:46.569 --> 12:49.447
It's very complicated.

12:50.209 --> 12:51.961
Complicated?

12:54.409 --> 12:55.728
Complicated.

13:04.569 --> 13:06.287
He's right, he deserves to know.

13:06.489 --> 13:09.561
But what am I gonna tell him?
What am I gonna do?

13:09.769 --> 13:14.320
I wish there was somehow
he could just move on with his life.

13:15.369 --> 13:19.078
Your wish, my command.

13:22.449 --> 13:24.326
Do not do that!

13:24.489 --> 13:25.638
Is that a wish?

13:25.849 --> 13:27.965
No, it is not a wish!

13:29.169 --> 13:32.081
So figure out how
to get rid of me yet?

13:32.289 --> 13:34.007
Yeah, I have to get you
back in the bottle.

13:34.209 --> 13:36.439
I have no idea how to do that,
but I will figure it out.

13:36.609 --> 13:37.928
Well, wish it and it will be so.

13:38.089 --> 13:40.922
Otherwise, your only shot
is if I volunteer to leave willingly,

13:41.089 --> 13:45.879
and, news flash,
that's not gonna happen.

13:46.569 --> 13:47.638
I'm sorry.

13:47.969 --> 13:50.642
Look, could you stop
trying to banish me

13:50.809 --> 13:53.243
just long enough for me to try
a little something on you?

13:53.409 --> 13:55.001
It's wish-free.

13:55.889 --> 13:57.641
All right.

14:10.329 --> 14:14.004
- Where did you learn how to do that?
- Little something a sultan taught me.

14:16.649 --> 14:19.800
Just out of curiosity,
what would you wish for yourself?

14:19.969 --> 14:22.164
I mean, you must have
heard them all, right?

14:22.329 --> 14:24.206
So, what would be your wish?

14:24.369 --> 14:27.008
Well, I mean, that's easy.

14:27.729 --> 14:30.846
I'd wish for the little things, you know.
Things people take for granted.

14:31.009 --> 14:34.126
I mean, the feeling of a suntan.

14:34.289 --> 14:37.804
Taste of ice cream,
preferably chocolate.

14:37.969 --> 14:41.245
Sex. That looks like that
could be a little bit of fun.

14:43.329 --> 14:45.479
I don't know, to be human.

14:47.249 --> 14:50.559
Yeah. That's what I'd wish for.

14:50.889 --> 14:53.084
So, what did you do
to yourself here?

14:53.249 --> 14:57.162
I was demon-duelling, and one of
my kicks was a little off-centre.

14:57.329 --> 15:01.368
So did you finish them off
with your scary witchy power?

15:01.849 --> 15:04.443
No, that is my power.

15:04.809 --> 15:07.277
- That's it?
- That and premonitions.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.241
You're a witch with no real powers?

15:09.609 --> 15:12.681
I mean, no, you know,
premonitions, those are:

15:12.849 --> 15:15.682
- Those are great, but...
- I know. I know.

15:15.849 --> 15:18.682
I mean, I would love an active power,
but what can you do?

15:22.169 --> 15:24.205
You've just done it!

15:24.529 --> 15:26.645
And I know exactly where to get one.

15:27.209 --> 15:29.325
- Was that a...?
- A wish? Yeah.

15:29.609 --> 15:31.839
Yeah, it was.

15:33.329 --> 15:36.287
And that's three, and I'm free.

15:36.449 --> 15:41.603
- Three? That wasn't even one.
- That's three, I'm gone. Yeah.

15:42.129 --> 15:44.848
Okay, if you're free,
then where's my power?

15:45.009 --> 15:48.126
Hello? Genie.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.206
I'll be right back.

15:59.729 --> 16:01.959
Well, thank you very much
for your time, I appreciate it.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.881
- Good luck.
- All right.

16:08.449 --> 16:10.246
What's going on?

16:11.649 --> 16:13.560
I got a job offer in Portland.

16:13.729 --> 16:16.004
I just thought I'd take it.

16:16.449 --> 16:18.087
Just like that?

16:19.449 --> 16:23.158
I just think it's time that
I move on with my life, don't you?

16:25.049 --> 16:27.847
Look, I really gotta go.

16:29.729 --> 16:31.208
Right.

16:38.169 --> 16:41.241
- Something's not right.
- But it's probably for the best.

16:41.409 --> 16:43.969
No, something he said
when I asked...

16:49.929 --> 16:51.760
Hey! Piper, check it out!

16:51.929 --> 16:56.480
Okay, so the valet guy said that this
cool ride is mine, can you believe it?

16:58.249 --> 16:59.967
Who's the cute boy?

17:00.809 --> 17:02.561
Prue?

17:02.729 --> 17:03.844
Hey, are you okay?

17:04.009 --> 17:07.398
I mean, don't take this the wrong way,
but you're looking kind of old.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.560
Yeah, and you're back in braces.

17:11.128 --> 17:14.484
Help! Is anyone home?

17:14.648 --> 17:17.209
- Prue! Piper!
- Phoebe!

17:17.368 --> 17:18.688
I'm up here.

17:21.769 --> 17:22.997
I can't get down.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.608
I don't know how I got up.

17:31.369 --> 17:34.406
- Gently.
- I gotcha.

17:35.089 --> 17:38.479
- Thank you, Leo.
- No problem.

17:40.009 --> 17:43.365
That is so totally cool.

17:43.569 --> 17:45.924
So do I get that power
when I get old too?

17:46.089 --> 17:48.398
All right, let's get something straight.
We are not old,

17:48.569 --> 17:51.083
we are just older than you are
right now, for some reason.

17:51.249 --> 17:54.366
Wait a minute.
Exactly how old are you?

17:54.529 --> 17:56.281
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen?

17:56.449 --> 17:58.007
Prue was a nightmare
at that age.

17:58.209 --> 18:00.928
- Why would she wish for that?
- She probably didn't.

18:01.129 --> 18:04.280
She probably wished for something
she could only get by being 17.

18:04.489 --> 18:07.128
Which explains why she has
no memory of being older.

18:07.329 --> 18:09.889
But how is that even possible?
I mean, it's so we...

18:10.569 --> 18:12.287
Okay.

18:12.969 --> 18:15.085
All right, maybe you should
just keep your arms down

18:15.249 --> 18:18.559
- till you learn to work the controls.
- Got it. Good idea.

18:18.769 --> 18:23.285
You sure you don't remember anything
about witches, genies, Dick?

18:23.489 --> 18:25.161
No, but it sounds totally bitchen.

18:25.369 --> 18:29.362
- This is such a cool book, what is it?
- I'll tell you when you're older.

18:29.569 --> 18:32.242
Let go of it. Stop it! Stop it!

18:32.409 --> 18:34.400
You know, you guys
have another problem.

18:34.569 --> 18:38.608
At 17, Prue didn't have her powers yet.
Makes you guys more vulnerable.

18:38.809 --> 18:42.040
Yeah, especially if whoever sent
the genie is a demon or something.

18:43.449 --> 18:46.168
Where's my power? I want it back!

18:46.369 --> 18:48.439
- Who is that?
- A demon or something.

18:48.609 --> 18:50.281
You stay here.

18:50.489 --> 18:52.445
- Come here!
- You stay.

18:57.529 --> 19:00.407
Remember what I told you about
wishes and the strings attached?

19:00.569 --> 19:03.925
That genie gave you a power,
but he must have stolen it from him.

19:04.089 --> 19:06.364
- Are we thinking demon or warlock?
- I don't know.

19:06.529 --> 19:08.679
Oh, my God! Who's the hottie?

19:08.889 --> 19:10.880
Oh, my God.
Get her out of here, now!

19:11.089 --> 19:13.045
- Go!
- Piper!

19:13.889 --> 19:15.720
Okay. Okay.

19:15.929 --> 19:20.684
- Okay. All right.
- Easy, easy.

19:23.049 --> 19:24.038
Okay, now what?

19:24.489 --> 19:27.765
Well, we can't vanquish him
if we don't know what he is.

19:28.729 --> 19:32.608
So why don't I just fly him out of here
and dump him somewhere?

19:32.809 --> 19:34.322
I don't know, can you do that?

19:34.529 --> 19:36.201
I have no idea,
but I could try to do that.

19:37.169 --> 19:39.160
I mean, I've always wanted
an active power, right?

19:39.729 --> 19:41.481
So let's see what I can do.

19:41.649 --> 19:43.958
- All right.
- All right.

19:51.369 --> 19:53.200
Phoebe?

20:19.329 --> 20:22.287
Your new little sister's in the bedroom
checking out the clothes.

20:22.489 --> 20:25.606
Nice to see some things
never change.

20:25.769 --> 20:28.647
I think I found our fire-breather.

20:28.809 --> 20:31.801
- Guys! Hello!
- A Dragon warlock.

20:31.969 --> 20:34.437
Most feared witch-killer there is.

20:34.649 --> 20:38.005
He can fly, breathe fire,
has supernatural strength.

20:38.169 --> 20:40.478
You're gonna need the power of three
to vanquish him.

20:40.649 --> 20:42.480
Which we don't have right now.

20:42.689 --> 20:46.045
If I ever find that genie again,
I'm gonna wish him into oblivion.

20:47.729 --> 20:50.084
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

20:54.929 --> 20:59.207
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

20:59.409 --> 21:01.479
- I'm great.
- All right, okay. All right.

21:03.609 --> 21:06.487
Flying's awesome.
It's the landing part that's a bitch.

21:06.649 --> 21:08.367
Yeah.

21:08.529 --> 21:10.360
All right, Leo. How do we fix this?

21:10.569 --> 21:12.127
I know how to fix it.

21:12.329 --> 21:14.923
According to the Book, we gotta
get the genie back in the bottle.

21:15.089 --> 21:17.557
It's the only way to undo the wishes
and make everything normal.

21:17.729 --> 21:20.004
First, we gotta find him,
and we don't know where to start.

21:20.209 --> 21:22.484
Well, he's really got a thing for food.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.038
Maybe he went back to that café
where he found Prue.

21:25.369 --> 21:26.961
It's worth a try.

21:36.809 --> 21:40.040
This guy's not a genie, he's a pig.

21:40.809 --> 21:42.800
Hi.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.925
Want to know what
I'm wishing for now?

21:45.089 --> 21:48.320
Look, you're probably
a little bit upset, huh?

21:48.489 --> 21:51.845
No, I've moved past upset
and right to pissed off!

21:52.049 --> 21:53.164
You tricked us,

21:53.329 --> 21:55.763
and now there's a warlock
trying to turn us into witch kabobs.

21:56.809 --> 21:58.561
Warlock? What warlock?

21:58.769 --> 22:01.488
A Dragon warlock. The one you stole
the flying power from?

22:01.689 --> 22:04.920
- You remember him?
- He came already?

22:05.129 --> 22:07.723
Wait a second. How did he know
where to look for you?

22:07.929 --> 22:10.318
- I don't know, you tell us.
- Well, I didn't tell him.

22:11.169 --> 22:14.479
Look, he probably just tracked it
somehow, that's all.

22:14.649 --> 22:16.401
I don't know.
We're not partners.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.888
I got this gig on my own.

22:18.049 --> 22:19.368
Wait, "gig"?

22:20.249 --> 22:22.126
So somebody did send you.
Who was it?

22:22.889 --> 22:27.405
Well, you see, that's part of
the whole genie-client privilege thing.

22:27.569 --> 22:31.403
I couldn't possibly tell.
Yeah, plus, that and they'll kill me.

22:31.609 --> 22:33.918
They're gonna have to wait in line.
Let's go, put that down.

22:34.089 --> 22:36.080
All right, just one more.
That chocolate's so good.

22:36.249 --> 22:38.240
- Put that down.
- You know, you are a real killjoy.

22:38.409 --> 22:42.368
You know what? You're going
right back in that bottle, buddy.

22:42.649 --> 22:44.002
What happened? Where did he go?

22:44.169 --> 22:46.080
I thought you said freed genies
don't have powers.

22:46.249 --> 22:50.447
They don't. Somebody who does
must have wanted him, badly.

22:52.609 --> 22:56.648
It has come to our attention
that you violated our pact.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.447
Your accuser will speak.

22:59.049 --> 23:01.119
He used the Halliwell wishes,
not to destroy them,

23:01.689 --> 23:03.725
but to free himself from his bottle.

23:04.209 --> 23:06.404
What do you say to this charge?

23:06.609 --> 23:10.682
It was all part of the master plan,
all right?

23:10.849 --> 23:13.124
And those witches
would be dead right now

23:13.289 --> 23:15.439
if Puff over here hadn't
screwed everything up.

23:15.729 --> 23:17.242
Screwed everything up?

23:18.649 --> 23:19.718
You stole a power from me.

23:19.929 --> 23:22.602
Borrowed, okay?
The term is "borrowed."

23:22.809 --> 23:26.768
And I knew that it would
piss you off so bad

23:26.969 --> 23:29.164
that you would be
that much more motivated

23:29.329 --> 23:32.844
to get out there
and kill you some witches, right?

23:33.049 --> 23:35.643
But your plan failed.

23:35.809 --> 23:38.607
The Dragon's attack was thwarted.

23:39.729 --> 23:42.766
Look, you don't go after
the witches with power.

23:43.449 --> 23:45.246
You go after the one without.

23:55.369 --> 23:56.722
Cool.

24:06.889 --> 24:07.878
Hello?

24:08.689 --> 24:11.283
When I first got the call,
I naturally dismissed it as a crank,

24:11.449 --> 24:13.679
until I realized it was the deputy mayor
on the other end.

24:13.929 --> 24:16.762
Okay, Darryl, can you speed this up,
because I'm kind of busy right now.

24:16.929 --> 24:18.806
What, flying?

24:20.689 --> 24:23.999
Now, see, I've learned to interpret
those pauses as admission.

24:24.449 --> 24:26.599
- What did he see?
- Actually it was his wife.

24:26.769 --> 24:30.398
Who swore she saw a brown-haired
woman fly over the house earlier.

24:30.569 --> 24:31.558
Without a plane.

24:32.249 --> 24:35.321
- How about a broomstick?
- Phoebe, this isn't funny.

24:35.489 --> 24:37.480
Just the fact that a call like that
got routed to me

24:37.649 --> 24:39.879
gives you some idea of
the pressure that I'm under here.

24:40.969 --> 24:43.039
- Phoebe?
- In here!

24:43.209 --> 24:48.124
Okay, Darryl, I'm really sorry, okay?
It won't happen again. I gotta go. Bye.

24:49.289 --> 24:51.883
- You didn't find the genie?
- We did, but then we lost him.

24:52.049 --> 24:53.038
Where's Prue?

24:53.209 --> 24:55.723
Upstairs, reminding me
what a pain she was at 17.

24:55.929 --> 24:57.999
Now you know why she was
lucky to make it to 18.

24:58.209 --> 25:01.884
- Why? What do you mean?
- Well, you remember better than I do.

25:02.049 --> 25:03.482
It was Prue's rebellious stage.

25:03.649 --> 25:05.480
She thought everything bad
was good,

25:05.649 --> 25:07.685
especially the guy she thought
she was in love with.

25:07.849 --> 25:10.079
- Until he attacked her.
- What?

25:10.289 --> 25:12.359
And Grams went crazy
when she found out.

25:12.529 --> 25:15.123
Come to think of it, that guy
disappeared not too long after that.

25:15.289 --> 25:16.802
You don't supposed Grams...?

25:17.529 --> 25:19.679
I'll get it. You go watch Prue.

25:26.369 --> 25:28.246
Can I help you?

25:28.409 --> 25:32.607
Piper, why the hell is
this happening to me?

25:32.769 --> 25:35.283
Prue snuck out of her window.
We have to go find her.

25:35.449 --> 25:38.566
Phoebe, that's Dan.

26:00.489 --> 26:02.605
How about a lift?

26:09.249 --> 26:11.968
- She's not answering.
- Well, maybe she doesn't know how.

26:12.129 --> 26:13.801
Were there even cell phones
ten years ago?

26:14.249 --> 26:17.446
She knows what a ringing phone
sounds like, doesn't she?

26:17.609 --> 26:20.282
Maybe I should fly around
and see if I could spot her car.

26:20.449 --> 26:22.758
You'll never be able to find it.
You have a hard enough time

26:22.929 --> 26:25.443
controlling the power in the daytime,
let alone at night.

26:25.609 --> 26:27.440
Why can't I get a premonition
when I want to?

26:28.369 --> 26:31.964
If I had one wish right now,
that's what it would be.

26:32.369 --> 26:35.247
At least your wish isn't hurting anyone.
Look what mine did.

26:36.209 --> 26:37.562
It's not your fault.

26:38.009 --> 26:39.283
How can it not be?

26:39.449 --> 26:42.964
Dan is aging because I wished
for him to move on with his life.

26:43.129 --> 26:45.199
He would be fine if it wasn't for me.

26:46.689 --> 26:48.645
It's not fair, he doesn't deserve this.

26:48.809 --> 26:52.927
It's bad enough the wishes are
biting us in the ass, but not him.

26:53.169 --> 26:55.763
This shouldn't be happening to him.

26:56.649 --> 27:00.198
We have to find the genie.
It's the only way to save Dan.

27:00.929 --> 27:02.567
And Prue.

27:03.809 --> 27:08.678
So, what, you don't have a name?

27:08.849 --> 27:11.124
Well, I go by a lot of names.

27:11.529 --> 27:12.882
Depends where I am.

27:13.729 --> 27:15.720
So why are my sisters
scared of you?

27:16.489 --> 27:18.002
Why did you come
to our house tonight?

27:18.169 --> 27:20.558
Because they have something
that I want.

27:20.969 --> 27:22.482
Something that's mine.

27:24.569 --> 27:26.446
Are you scared of me?

27:30.489 --> 27:32.047
No.

27:45.489 --> 27:46.558
Okay.

27:47.329 --> 27:50.082
God, it's ringing again.
How do you turn it off?

27:59.249 --> 28:00.728
Hey, easy.

28:00.929 --> 28:03.648
Okay. Hey, hey, easy.

28:04.569 --> 28:06.127
Easy!

28:06.409 --> 28:09.242
Are you scared of me now?

28:18.209 --> 28:21.167
It won't be too long before she calls
her sisters to come and rescue her.

28:21.329 --> 28:23.445
It's the perfect trap.

28:24.009 --> 28:25.601
You didn't hurt her, did you?

28:25.769 --> 28:27.760
Because I thought I heard screams.

28:27.929 --> 28:29.965
You've spent too much time
with humans already.

28:30.129 --> 28:32.199
Developing a conscience.

28:33.289 --> 28:36.042
You want your freedom,
you do exactly as I say.

28:36.209 --> 28:38.803
- You understand?
- Absolutely.

28:46.209 --> 28:49.246
Dan, I'm so sorry.

28:50.489 --> 28:52.445
I don't understand.

28:56.009 --> 28:58.603
This is gonna be hard
for me to explain,

28:58.769 --> 29:01.886
and even harder for you to believe.

29:02.889 --> 29:04.288
We're witches.

29:04.689 --> 29:06.805
Prue, Phoebe and myself.

29:07.009 --> 29:10.445
And not your everyday
kind of witches.

29:10.609 --> 29:14.397
We have supernatural powers
that we use to fight off...

29:16.689 --> 29:18.327
...demons and warlocks.

29:19.129 --> 29:22.724
You know, all the family emergencies
that I used to have.

29:24.209 --> 29:28.487
I never told you before because I didn't
want you to be hurt because of it.

29:28.649 --> 29:31.322
I didn't want something like this
to happen to you.

29:34.129 --> 29:38.884
And I'm the same Leo Wyatt
that died in 1942.

29:39.289 --> 29:43.646
I'm a whitelighter,
a guardian angel for witches.

29:43.849 --> 29:46.568
Yeah, right.

30:25.889 --> 30:27.641
Piper!

30:28.649 --> 30:31.243
I just had a premonition.
I have no idea what it means.

30:34.289 --> 30:37.122
- Hello?
- Oh, my God. Piper.

30:37.289 --> 30:38.768
Thank God. You have to help me.

30:39.249 --> 30:41.001
- Prue?
- Where is she?

30:41.169 --> 30:44.286
Piper, he's trying to kill me. Dragon.

30:44.769 --> 30:47.124
He's trying to kill me,
and I don't think he's human.

30:47.329 --> 30:49.047
Okay, calm down.

30:49.209 --> 30:51.677
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

30:51.849 --> 30:55.478
I think he's following me.
You have to come quick!

30:55.649 --> 30:57.401
Okay. Prue, where are you?

30:57.609 --> 30:58.678
Golden Gate Park.

30:58.849 --> 30:59.884
Okay, listen to me.

31:00.049 --> 31:03.166
Go to the lake where Dad used to
take us fishing, remember?

31:03.329 --> 31:05.445
And hide under the bridge
until we get there, okay?

31:07.409 --> 31:08.524
I think he's coming!

31:08.729 --> 31:10.481
Prue? Prue!

31:11.809 --> 31:13.879
- What?
- Dragon's after her.

31:14.049 --> 31:16.404
Well, it's a trap.
You know it's a trap.

31:16.569 --> 31:18.321
Doesn't matter, Leo.
We have to go anyway.

31:18.489 --> 31:19.968
Well, at least go with a plan.

31:20.169 --> 31:21.807
Try using your new power,
fly overhead,

31:21.969 --> 31:25.518
- and spot him before he spots you.
- All right.

31:26.329 --> 31:28.445
- Stay with Dan, we'll be back.
- You better be.

31:28.609 --> 31:30.725
We gotta hurry,
it's gonna be light soon.

31:49.649 --> 31:51.640
Okay, you think you can
control the power this time?

31:51.809 --> 31:53.481
I'll have to, I have no choice.

31:53.649 --> 31:55.640
Right, I spot the Dragon,
you freeze him.

31:55.809 --> 31:57.720
Then we find Prue
and get the hell out of here.

31:57.889 --> 32:00.449
All right, go. Fly.

32:14.049 --> 32:17.519
Piper! Piper! Piper!

32:17.729 --> 32:19.685
- Prue?
- Piper!

32:20.049 --> 32:21.880
- No! Prue.
- Piper!

32:22.049 --> 32:23.482
Go back!

32:23.689 --> 32:25.884
- Go! Go!
- Piper!

32:26.689 --> 32:28.042
What are you doing?
Let go of me!

32:28.209 --> 32:30.006
- I'm sorry.
- Let go!

32:31.369 --> 32:32.643
Let go of her, damn it!

32:33.409 --> 32:34.558
No, I can't.

32:34.769 --> 32:35.997
- Piper!
- No!

32:40.889 --> 32:43.005
Come on, keep coming.

32:43.209 --> 32:45.643
- Come and save your little sister.
- No!

32:46.089 --> 32:48.762
No. No. No!

32:50.169 --> 32:52.205
- No!
- Prue.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.402
Prue!

32:56.849 --> 32:58.567
Time to get my power back.

33:02.129 --> 33:03.687
Let go!

33:06.569 --> 33:07.604
Prue!

33:12.649 --> 33:15.721
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

33:15.929 --> 33:19.080
Oh, my God!
What do we do? What do we do?

33:19.249 --> 33:22.286
Leo can heal her. I know he can.
We just need to get her home.

33:22.449 --> 33:24.360
Go get the car, Phoebe.
Go get the car!

33:24.849 --> 33:26.840
Oh, my God!

33:28.449 --> 33:30.565
Oh, God, what have I done?

33:31.529 --> 33:34.202
Leo! Leo!

33:36.209 --> 33:39.963
- What happened?
- Never mind, just heal her. Come on.

33:46.009 --> 33:48.284
What's the matter?
Why isn't it working?

33:48.529 --> 33:50.599
Leo?

33:51.129 --> 33:52.687
I can't heal the dead.

33:54.569 --> 33:56.446
Yes, you can.

34:12.248 --> 34:13.568
What the hell is he doing here?

34:13.728 --> 34:15.924
Wait, wait, just hear him out.
He may have an idea.

34:16.969 --> 34:19.199
Listen, I'm so sorry.

34:19.529 --> 34:22.089
All I ever wanted was
my freedom, that's it.

34:22.248 --> 34:25.081
That's all
that I was thinking about. Look...

34:26.649 --> 34:28.685
...l'm just a genie.
- Get to the point!

34:28.849 --> 34:30.646
He's willing to give up his freedom.

34:31.409 --> 34:33.445
Go back in the bottle
and reverse the wishes.

34:33.649 --> 34:35.605
I'll return everything
to the way it was.

34:35.809 --> 34:38.880
- Even Prue?
- It should.

34:39.049 --> 34:42.359
I mean, teenage Prue is the one
that got killed, not adult Prue.

34:44.129 --> 34:46.165
How do we know this
isn't just another trick?

34:46.809 --> 34:49.083
Well, if it gets Prue back,

34:49.248 --> 34:51.444
you'd have the power of three
to vanquish the Dragon.

34:52.248 --> 34:53.568
What do you got to lose?

35:06.769 --> 35:07.884
After you.

35:25.649 --> 35:27.367
Try to fly.

35:42.449 --> 35:44.121
Prue.

35:46.689 --> 35:49.157
It worked, Dan's...

35:50.169 --> 35:51.921
No, it didn't.

35:52.129 --> 35:54.040
All it did was turn her back
into her adult self.

35:54.209 --> 35:56.086
- It didn't save her.
- Wait.

35:56.249 --> 35:58.479
The genie is back in the bottle,
so if we can get him out,

35:58.649 --> 36:00.162
then we have three
more wishes, right?

36:00.329 --> 36:02.604
All we need is one.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.999
- Piper?
- Dan, get down!

36:20.849 --> 36:23.886
- Did you see where the bottle went?
- No, I have no id... Wait, yeah.

36:24.049 --> 36:26.324
In my premonition.

36:26.529 --> 36:28.918
- You distract him.
- Right.

36:30.849 --> 36:33.602
Too bad you don't have
my power anymore!

36:33.769 --> 36:35.839
Hey Dragon-breath, over here.

36:43.329 --> 36:45.081
I wish Prue were alive.

36:45.809 --> 36:48.198
Piper, go check on Prue.

36:48.409 --> 36:51.845
- Where the hell did you come from?
- No, no, that's where you came from.

36:52.289 --> 36:56.805
The power of three will set us free
The power of three will set us free

36:57.489 --> 37:02.802
The power of three will set us free
The power of three will set us free.

37:20.769 --> 37:21.758
Hi.

37:22.409 --> 37:24.604
Look, Piper, I really don't feel
like talking right now.

37:24.809 --> 37:27.801
Wait, wait. We're gonna
have to talk some time.

37:27.969 --> 37:29.960
No. We don't.

37:30.129 --> 37:34.680
I don't know how you expected me
to react to your secret, but I don't...

37:36.809 --> 37:38.083
I'm really sorry you told me.

37:39.489 --> 37:43.368
I wish you never did.
I wish I never saw what I saw.

37:44.009 --> 37:47.445
I never imagined
things like that even...

37:49.129 --> 37:50.721
...existed.

37:50.929 --> 37:52.806
- Dan...
- Please, just go away.

37:53.209 --> 37:54.847
I don't want to know any more.

37:55.049 --> 37:57.517
And I don't want to know
any more about you.

38:09.769 --> 38:12.363
They call themselves the Council
and they're scary dudes,

38:12.529 --> 38:14.838
very high up on the evil food chain.

38:15.009 --> 38:16.408
It's only gonna be a matter of time

38:16.569 --> 38:18.321
before they send somebody
looking for you.

38:18.489 --> 38:21.720
Means we're doing something right
if we're getting their attention.

38:21.889 --> 38:24.357
Plus it means that there's some
method to this Wiccan madness,

38:24.529 --> 38:26.406
some greater purpose.

38:26.569 --> 38:27.638
It's nice to finally know.

38:27.849 --> 38:29.441
Be careful what you wish for.

38:29.649 --> 38:33.198
Oh, I am a reformed wishaholic,
believe me.

38:33.369 --> 38:35.360
I'm in no hurry
to get any new powers.

38:35.529 --> 38:38.521
Besides, the power you already have
is the one that saved the day anyway.

38:38.729 --> 38:40.321
I know and I love it.

38:40.529 --> 38:43.089
I do. I just have to work on
controlling it better.

38:43.249 --> 38:45.365
Yeah, and I'm gonna concentrate
on finding Mr. Right,

38:45.529 --> 38:48.885
not settling for Dick.

38:51.409 --> 38:55.880
Well, speaking of wishes,
you still got two left, you know.

38:56.049 --> 38:58.244
Yes, we know, and we already know
what one of them is.

38:58.409 --> 39:00.127
If you're up for it, that is.

39:01.769 --> 39:03.407
We want to make you mortal.

39:03.689 --> 39:06.567
Keep you off of the Council's radar,
once and for all.

39:06.769 --> 39:09.567
True freedom.
And not just from the bottle.

39:09.729 --> 39:12.004
Although, mortality
is the consequence.

39:12.209 --> 39:14.404
And feelings too.

39:14.609 --> 39:16.440
Even the painful ones.

39:16.649 --> 39:20.608
That's okay. I think I'm ready.
Feeling pretty sensitive these days.

39:21.049 --> 39:23.882
Let me ask you something.
Why would you do that for me?

39:24.049 --> 39:26.643
I mean, especially after
I helped kill you.

39:26.809 --> 39:28.959
Yeah, well, you also helped
bring me back.

39:29.129 --> 39:31.245
And besides, once you're human,

39:31.409 --> 39:34.162
we don't have to worry
about you tricking us again.

39:34.969 --> 39:37.244
But there's one wish
you have to grant first.

39:37.449 --> 39:39.644
One that I need.

39:39.809 --> 39:41.083
I want Dan to have peace of mind,

39:41.249 --> 39:44.480
to forget about all the horrible things
that happened the past couple of days,

39:44.649 --> 39:47.209
about who we all really are.

39:47.529 --> 39:50.999
I wish that Dan could
truly move on with his life,

39:51.169 --> 39:53.125
without consequences.

39:55.729 --> 39:59.768
Your wish is my command.

40:22.169 --> 40:23.761
No tricks, right?

40:23.929 --> 40:26.489
No tricks. I promise.

40:26.849 --> 40:29.158
Got no powers.

40:35.249 --> 40:37.604
Well, that was an interesting
couple of days.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.805
Interesting couple of years.

40:41.649 --> 40:43.685
They're calling me, I gotta go.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.601
Not so fast.

40:45.769 --> 40:47.282
If we're ever gonna
make this work,

40:47.449 --> 40:50.919
I think I deserve to know a little bit
more about you, don't you think?

40:51.089 --> 40:54.126
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm going with you, Leo.

40:55.609 --> 40:57.281
I'd like to meet them.

40:58.169 --> 40:59.727
Are you sure?

40:59.889 --> 41:03.564
Positive. Take me to your leader.

41:04.769 --> 41:06.407
Piper?

41:06.609 --> 41:08.565
What are you...? What...?

41:08.809 --> 41:10.527
Don't worry, I'll be back.

41:17.649 --> 41:19.560
Worry? I'm not worried.

41:19.729 --> 41:21.401
I mean, of course
she'll be back, right?

41:21.609 --> 41:23.520
Of course.
I mean, why would we worry?
