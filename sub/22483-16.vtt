00:08.000 --> 00:09.625
COLLEEN:
<i>Hi!</i>

00:09.709 --> 00:12.166
Thank you for watching Lark.
It's so nice we can

00:12.250 --> 00:13.500
trust you with her
now that she doesn't

00:13.583 --> 00:15.208
have soft spots in her skull.

00:15.291 --> 00:16.625
We had so much fun.

00:16.709 --> 00:18.542
Lark, come show Mommy.

00:19.583 --> 00:21.208
Boom. Aunt Colleen fixed me.

00:21.291 --> 00:22.959
Now I'm pretty.

00:23.041 --> 00:26.208
Wha... But-but you're also
pretty in your brain, too.

00:26.291 --> 00:28.583
Right? Where it,
where it really matters.

00:28.667 --> 00:30.333
(chuckles)

00:30.417 --> 00:33.500
Lark found one of my old pageant
gowns I had stored in the attic.

00:33.583 --> 00:35.208
What-what was Lark
doing in the attic?

00:35.291 --> 00:37.375
I don't know. I asked her,
she wouldn't tell me.

00:37.458 --> 00:40.375
Yeah. I forgot that
you used to do pageants.

00:40.458 --> 00:41.875
-That's right.
-(both laugh)

00:41.959 --> 00:43.000
All right. Let's, uh,

00:43.083 --> 00:44.458
let's get this dress
off of you.

00:44.542 --> 00:46.834
-Oh.
-Can I keep it?

00:46.917 --> 00:49.208
Uh, it's "May I keep it?"

00:49.291 --> 00:51.583
And the answer is no.

00:51.667 --> 00:54.250
Well, of course she can keep it.
She looks great in it.

00:54.333 --> 00:57.375
Who knows, Jen? You might have
a pageant star on your hands.

00:57.458 --> 00:58.667
(chuckles) We might.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.041
Yeah.

01:00.125 --> 01:02.333
She is beautiful,
but her real talent is math.

01:02.417 --> 01:03.458
Right, Lark?

01:03.542 --> 01:04.917
What's two plus two?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.333
Green.

01:07.417 --> 01:09.458
Spin around again. Show her.

01:11.125 --> 01:12.834
(Jen clears throat)

01:12.917 --> 01:15.166
Look what I had to peel off
our daughter.

01:15.250 --> 01:16.375
Oh.

01:16.458 --> 01:18.000
Did I miss Lark's
preschool prom?

01:18.083 --> 01:19.125
No.

01:19.208 --> 01:21.166
Colleen decided to dress up Lark

01:21.250 --> 01:23.250
in one of her
old pageant outfits.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.542
Freaked me out so much,

01:24.625 --> 01:26.041
I went and bought her a blazer

01:26.125 --> 01:27.875
-and some smart slacks.
-What's the big deal?

01:27.959 --> 01:30.875
Kids love playing dress-up,
and so do <i>some </i>adults.

01:30.959 --> 01:33.083
For the last time,
Iron Man and Wonder Woman

01:33.166 --> 01:34.709
are never having sex, okay?

01:34.792 --> 01:36.750
She's a natural-born superbeing,

01:36.834 --> 01:39.458
and he is a rich mortal
with some high-tech gadgets.

01:39.542 --> 01:41.291
Okay. The fact
that you even know that

01:41.375 --> 01:43.709
only makes this fantasy
more intense.

01:43.792 --> 01:46.125
It's just weird of Colleen
to be dressing her up

01:46.208 --> 01:48.375
in these girly costumes,
you know?

01:48.458 --> 01:50.208
I think I need
to say something to her.

01:50.291 --> 01:51.542
I really don't think
you should. All right?

01:51.625 --> 01:53.583
I mean, Matt and Colleen,
they're having trouble

01:53.667 --> 01:56.500
getting pregnant, and look,
this is making her happy.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.750
You know? Maybe you should
just let it go.

01:58.834 --> 02:00.750
(clicks tongue) Yeah.

02:00.834 --> 02:02.500
I guess you're right.

02:02.583 --> 02:05.083
Think of pimping out
our daughter as a mitzvah.

02:05.166 --> 02:08.250
Aw, you used a Jewish word.

02:08.333 --> 02:09.291
I did.

02:09.375 --> 02:11.000
All right, go get the costume.

02:12.083 --> 02:13.208
(grunts softly)

02:13.291 --> 02:14.500
(quietly):
Cool.

02:16.667 --> 02:18.667
(doorbell rings)

02:18.750 --> 02:20.417
-Hi!
-Hi.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.542
Oh...

02:21.625 --> 02:23.250
Uh, wow, Colleen.

02:23.333 --> 02:24.792
I wasn't expecting you.

02:24.875 --> 02:26.583
Well, I couldn't help but notice

02:26.667 --> 02:28.750
how much you loved
seeing Lark in my old dress.

02:28.834 --> 02:31.667
I mean, your face
was literally, like...

02:31.750 --> 02:34.542
(laughs):
It was. It was just literally
like that.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.208
I knew you caught pageant fever.

02:36.291 --> 02:38.583
So I brought over all these
outfits, so we can really see

02:38.667 --> 02:39.667
what we're working with.

02:39.750 --> 02:40.875
Mm.

02:40.959 --> 02:42.166
Now, I have one question.

02:42.917 --> 02:44.375
Can Lark twerk?

02:44.458 --> 02:45.792
-No.
-(groans)

02:45.875 --> 02:48.000
-But we tried, right?
-(both laugh)

02:48.083 --> 02:50.583
Well, if I can teach Joan
to twerk, I can teach anyone.

02:50.667 --> 02:51.792
Is Lark sleeping?

02:51.875 --> 02:53.041
Lark!

02:53.125 --> 02:54.750
Time to wake up!

02:56.083 --> 02:58.041
Okay. I'm practicing
my fake smile, right?

02:58.125 --> 02:59.333
So when Colleen comes out,

02:59.417 --> 03:01.625
even if Lark is spray-tanned,

03:01.709 --> 03:03.458
I'm just gonna go like this:

03:03.542 --> 03:06.083
"Look at you!"

03:06.166 --> 03:07.500
What do you think?

03:07.583 --> 03:09.333
Well, that's your brunch face.

03:09.417 --> 03:12.083
-I know!
-COLLEEN: Come on,
let's show Mommy.

03:12.166 --> 03:14.333
(chuckles) Wow!

03:14.417 --> 03:17.166
Look at you!

03:17.250 --> 03:20.375
I'm bringing sexy back.

03:21.458 --> 03:22.667
Doesn't she look amazing?

03:22.750 --> 03:24.166
If she got kidnapped right now,

03:24.250 --> 03:25.875
the press would have
a field day.

03:25.959 --> 03:28.083
Uh, excuse me,
did-did you put junk

03:28.166 --> 03:29.875
-in our daughter's trunk?
-Yeah.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.083
I had to pad her butt.

03:31.166 --> 03:33.333
The judges really respond
to curves.

03:33.417 --> 03:35.542
Sorry, uh, what judges?

03:35.625 --> 03:37.792
I signed Lark up
for her first pageant.

03:37.875 --> 03:39.792
Without asking me?

03:39.875 --> 03:42.208
Well, with "us."
She should've asked us, right?

03:42.291 --> 03:43.750
We can talk about that later.

03:43.834 --> 03:45.458
You guys, don't worry.
With my help,

03:45.542 --> 03:46.875
this little girl is gonna rise

03:46.959 --> 03:48.208
straight to the top.
Which, in this case,

03:48.291 --> 03:50.125
is the basement
of an airport Radisson.

03:50.208 --> 03:52.542
I'm sorry, no. I-I'm...
I have to put an end to this.

03:52.625 --> 03:55.041
-No...
-Enough. We're not entering
Lark into anything.

03:55.125 --> 03:56.166
But why not?

03:56.250 --> 03:57.500
Look how happy she is.

03:57.583 --> 03:58.625
GREG:
Yeah, but what does she know?

03:58.709 --> 04:00.166
She's chewing on her eyelash.

04:00.250 --> 04:01.500
COLLEEN:
Oh. Horse hair

04:01.583 --> 04:03.166
is completely edible.

04:03.250 --> 04:04.625
I mean, it doesn't matter,
all animal hair is.

04:04.709 --> 04:05.750
It's fine.

04:05.834 --> 04:07.959
No, it's not fine. Okay?

04:08.041 --> 04:09.875
I'm her mother,
and it's not up to you.

04:09.959 --> 04:12.000
-So you and Matt can do this
to your own daughter.
-Oh...

04:13.542 --> 04:15.000
Hmm.

04:15.083 --> 04:16.542
I, uh, I-I'm sorry.

04:16.625 --> 04:18.041
I didn't, I didn't mean to...

04:18.125 --> 04:20.166
No, no, no.
It's fine. It's okay.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.625
Come on, Lark. We got to get you
in a warm bath for an hour

04:22.709 --> 04:24.041
so the butt glue will dissolve.

04:30.709 --> 04:32.709
Hey.

04:32.792 --> 04:36.041
Listen, I feel really bad
about the way that came out.

04:36.125 --> 04:37.500
No. No, don't.

04:37.583 --> 04:39.583
I overstepped.

04:39.667 --> 04:42.291
It's just, we have been
trying so hard to have a kid

04:42.375 --> 04:44.208
that it was really nice
to be reminded

04:44.291 --> 04:46.208
of what we're actually
working toward.

04:46.291 --> 04:49.083
Yeah, I know.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.959
Hey, you know what?
Just because we don't

04:51.041 --> 04:53.208
want Lark wearing a swimsuit
in a Radisson ballroom

04:53.291 --> 04:55.083
doesn't mean you can't still
hang out with her.

04:55.166 --> 04:57.250
Aw. It's a Radisson basement.

04:57.333 --> 04:59.083
-Okay.
-And I love her so much.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.917
Well, you can play with her
anytime you want.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.709
I just hate that
she's never gonna get to do

05:02.792 --> 05:04.709
the routine we practiced.

05:04.792 --> 05:06.125
(sighs)

05:06.208 --> 05:07.250
Yep.

05:07.333 --> 05:10.291
Well, them's the breaks.

05:10.375 --> 05:11.375
-(both chuckle)
-I guess.

05:11.458 --> 05:13.291
-Good lesson for her, you know.
-Uh-huh.

05:13.375 --> 05:15.875
That you work hard at things and
sometimes they don't pay off.

05:15.959 --> 05:18.458
She just got so good at it.

05:18.542 --> 05:20.792
Yeah, yeah. She's a little
Renaissance toddler. So...

05:20.875 --> 05:22.041
And that baton
was super expensive.

05:22.125 --> 05:23.208
I had to overnight it...

05:23.291 --> 05:24.625
-Mm-hmm.
-...which cost even more.

05:24.709 --> 05:25.875
I don't know what
their return policy is,

05:25.959 --> 05:26.959
-so then, I'm just like, out...
-Okay.

05:27.041 --> 05:29.041
-Okay, fine. You win.
-...that cash.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.917
-(giggles)
-But I am her manager,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.750
so I have a few notes.

05:35.333 --> 05:36.667
Okay. Now,

05:36.750 --> 05:38.208
before we get started,

05:38.291 --> 05:40.083
just a reminder:

05:40.166 --> 05:42.083
do not look directly at Lark.

05:42.166 --> 05:46.208
Because you are about
to see a star. (giggles)

05:46.291 --> 05:48.875
Does Colleen know that
you can look directly at stars?

05:48.959 --> 05:50.667

Ma'am, I believe what
you're describing is Batman.

07:14.458 --> 07:17.166
Oh, well, then call him.

07:17.250 --> 07:20.375
That cop couldn't have
cared less about my bike.

07:20.458 --> 07:24.000
She just gave up and then moved
on to some missing persons case.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.375
All right.
Let's find it on Craigslist.

07:26.458 --> 07:28.709
-(sighs)
-How would a robber

07:28.792 --> 07:30.542
describe your bike?

07:30.625 --> 07:31.750
Like a sunset

07:31.834 --> 07:34.291
after a week of rain.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.667
It had a kind of energy
to it.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.875
-So we'll say pink.
-Perfect.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.542
Okay, so you're gonna type in
the description here,

07:40.625 --> 07:42.166
and then you're gonna hit
the search button

07:42.250 --> 07:45.125
and it'll show you all the bikes
for sale in the area.

07:46.458 --> 07:49.625
Oh. There's nothing there.

07:49.709 --> 07:52.083
You didn't type anything.

07:52.166 --> 07:54.667
Oh, I thought you were telling
the computer to do that.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.917
No, no, <i>you </i>have to hit
the search button.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.208
-Oh!
-(chuckles)

08:00.291 --> 08:02.041
Still nothing.

08:02.125 --> 08:04.667
Mom, you didn't type anything;
you just hit the search button.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.750
Yeah, that's what you said
to do.

08:09.917 --> 08:11.792
Since when does this qualify
as brunch?

08:11.875 --> 08:13.250
This is the third
most disappointing spread

08:13.333 --> 08:14.375
I've ever seen.

08:14.458 --> 08:16.125
The other two,
you won't believe.

08:16.208 --> 08:19.375
Number one:
winter, 2004, Lillehammer.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.709
Where has Mom been?

08:20.792 --> 08:23.500
I mean, it's so unlike her
to just ignore brunch.

08:23.583 --> 08:26.125
Brussels sprouts were making
a real big noise on the scene.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.375
JOAN:
Matt!

08:27.458 --> 08:29.083
Matt, Matt, Matt!
I found it!

08:29.166 --> 08:32.000
My bike!
And it <i>was </i>on Craigslist!

08:32.083 --> 08:33.041
-Hey!
-A robber

08:33.125 --> 08:34.875
named Dale has it.

08:34.959 --> 08:36.250
I'm gonna go get him.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.417
Uh, Mom, you can't do that.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.709
No, don't worry.
I changed my identity.

08:40.792 --> 08:42.667
I told him my name
was Jen Short.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.208
Like my wife, Jen Short?

08:44.291 --> 08:46.792
I panicked. It was the first
name that I could think of.

08:46.875 --> 08:49.041
So, Dad is all right with you

08:49.125 --> 08:51.875
just meeting some stranger
off the Internet?

08:51.959 --> 08:53.500
Oh, no. He can't know.

08:53.583 --> 08:57.125
He told me to lock up the bike,
and I said, "You lock it up."

08:57.208 --> 08:59.959
And then I was on a bit of
a high for the rest of the day

09:00.041 --> 09:01.458
and I forgot all about it.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.917
Okay, Mom, you can't go
do this all by yourself.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.375
You don't know who this guy is.

09:05.458 --> 09:08.792
This Dale could be
some sort of weirdo

09:08.875 --> 09:11.250
who likes to sniff women's
bikes or something.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.625
Yeah, a real seat freak.
I know the type.

09:13.709 --> 09:15.834
Well, you know, bring him on.

09:15.917 --> 09:17.500
Because it's my bike
and I'm gonna be

09:17.583 --> 09:19.375
the only freak on that seat.

09:19.458 --> 09:20.709
Okay, well,
you're not going alone.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.291
No, we're gonna go with you.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.625
Oh. My boys.

09:24.709 --> 09:26.959
Road trip. Shotgun!

09:27.041 --> 09:28.500
Yay!

09:28.583 --> 09:30.875
Okay, here's the deal.

09:30.959 --> 09:34.542
First, I appeal to the robber's
sense of humanity.

09:34.625 --> 09:35.583
If that doesn't work,

09:35.667 --> 09:38.959
I've got a sock
filled with D-batteries.

09:39.959 --> 09:41.458
Hey, where's Tim?

09:43.625 --> 09:45.542
Ugh, we forgot Tim.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.709
So you guys didn't forget me,
you just stopped to get gas?

09:53.542 --> 09:54.834
Yeah, man.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.166
(Matt inhales sharply)

09:56.250 --> 09:57.333
So, what's the deal here?

09:57.417 --> 09:58.792
We gonna pay this guy or what?

09:58.875 --> 10:00.542
Pay for my own bike?

10:00.625 --> 10:03.667
No way, punk.
That's what I'm gonna call him.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.417
Do you think that's
rough enough?

10:05.500 --> 10:08.417
You know, or, I could joke
about his mother's weight,

10:08.500 --> 10:10.625
or I could say, you know,

10:10.709 --> 10:13.000
how many times
I've had my way with her.

10:16.166 --> 10:20.959
And here's a picture of me on my
bike when I ran the LA Marathon.

10:21.041 --> 10:22.500
Cute. Look,

10:22.583 --> 10:24.375
you're gonna need to give me
some better proof

10:24.458 --> 10:25.709
than some photos.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.375
The serial number, maybe?

10:27.458 --> 10:30.583
'Cause you can't just accuse me
of stealing your bike, Jen.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.500
Why you got the cute
little pink bike, man?

10:32.583 --> 10:34.417
Seem like more of
a sexy motorcycle guy.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.709
Thanks. I'm selling it
for a friend.

10:36.792 --> 10:39.875
Who? Your mother?
She has her own zip code.

10:39.959 --> 10:41.000
-Mm.
-Ooh, easy, Ma.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.417
His mom's easy.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.667
-What?
-I want my bike.

10:44.750 --> 10:47.250
Well, this bike... is 100 bucks.

10:47.333 --> 10:49.000
So you want to buy it or not?

10:49.083 --> 10:50.125
Yeah. You win.

10:50.208 --> 10:51.208
Wait.

10:51.291 --> 10:53.333
If the reason you guys forgot me

10:53.417 --> 10:55.041
is 'cause you were stopping
to get gas,

10:55.125 --> 10:56.166
then why did we stop for gas?

10:56.250 --> 10:58.208
Tim, you are being paranoid,
okay?

10:58.291 --> 11:00.667
We did not leave you
at home intentionally.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.583
I never said intentionally.

11:02.667 --> 11:03.917
Will you take $80 for it?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.083
I'll go ask my friend.

11:09.083 --> 11:11.125
-Take the bike.
-What?

11:11.208 --> 11:13.208
Take the bike,
we don't have much time.

11:13.291 --> 11:14.333
You want us to steal it?

11:14.417 --> 11:16.291
It's not stealing, it's mine!

11:16.375 --> 11:18.375
Go!

11:18.458 --> 11:20.542
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

11:20.625 --> 11:23.125
Oh, wow!
I haven't felt this high

11:23.208 --> 11:25.709
since the marijuana jam!

11:25.792 --> 11:27.625
-(chuckling)
-Where's Tim?

11:27.709 --> 11:30.125
What? We forgot Tim!

11:30.208 --> 11:31.417
(groans)

11:31.500 --> 11:33.375
Thanks for letting me
use your phone.

11:33.458 --> 11:34.625
I'm sure they're
just getting gas.

11:34.709 --> 11:36.208
-(line ringing)
-It's ringing.

11:36.291 --> 11:39.542
Tell them to bring my $80
or they don't get <i>you </i>back.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.625
Yeah, I think you're gonna need
a different approach.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.250
HEATHER:
Hey.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.375
Is the coast clear?

11:50.458 --> 11:52.208
Well, it depends on
what you want to do.

11:52.291 --> 11:55.792
(scoffs) I have a box
of Sophia's stuffed animals.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.875
Ooh, are you gonna put them
on the couch and watch a movie?

11:57.959 --> 12:00.166
No. I'm gonna give them
to Goodwill.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.792
She's letting you do that?

12:01.875 --> 12:04.041
Oh, no.
Babe, she has no idea.

12:04.125 --> 12:06.375
I have been running
an underground railroad

12:06.458 --> 12:08.250
out of her bedroom for months;
she hasn't even noticed.

12:08.333 --> 12:09.500
It's time to pull the trigger.

12:09.583 --> 12:11.542
-Yes. Tell you what.
-Yeah?

12:11.625 --> 12:13.667
-I'll cover you to the garage.
-Oh.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.959
Make sure the coast is clear.
(chuckles)

12:17.208 --> 12:18.291
Hey, Soph.

12:19.667 --> 12:22.166
What's going on down here?

12:22.917 --> 12:24.000
Nothing.

12:24.083 --> 12:25.458
Okay, what's in the box?

12:25.542 --> 12:26.583
Nothing.

12:29.542 --> 12:30.792
Nothing?

12:30.875 --> 12:34.333
Unicorns are mythical,
not invisible.

12:34.417 --> 12:37.125
Honey, you have thousands
of stuffed animals.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.583
How many could you need?

12:38.667 --> 12:40.542
How many children do you need?

12:40.625 --> 12:42.917
-Oh...
-Get rid of Tyler.
Then we'll talk.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.041
Sophia.

12:44.125 --> 12:46.917
Mom, you just don't see them
how I see them.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.625

Every day, Tank scratches
at the door.

16:33.792 --> 16:37.125
Is that jerky? Wait a minute.

16:37.208 --> 16:38.667
What have you done with Tank?

16:38.750 --> 16:39.959
Uh, Pop-Pop, calm down.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.667
We're just making beef jerky.

16:41.750 --> 16:42.959
It's our new side business.

16:43.041 --> 16:44.208
CLEMENTINE:
Yeah, and don't worry.

16:44.291 --> 16:46.959
No animals were harmed
in the making of this.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.375
-To be clear,
none of them lived.
-Hmm.

16:49.458 --> 16:53.709
We're calling it Pop Pop's
Old Fashioned Plan Beef.

16:53.792 --> 16:54.875
You recognize that guy?

16:54.959 --> 16:56.125
We wanted a handsome face.

16:56.208 --> 16:57.333
JOHN:
Oh, look at me.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.750
-I'm like Paul Newman.
-(both laugh)

16:59.834 --> 17:02.417
Or that Wendy's gal.
What's her name? Uh...

17:02.500 --> 17:04.208
You're famous, Pop-Pop.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.875
Yeah, well, I don't want
to be famous.

17:05.959 --> 17:09.125
I want to be rich.
Uh, so, what's my cut?

17:09.208 --> 17:11.291
-Your cut?
-Mm-hmm.

17:11.375 --> 17:13.375
Oh, we thought that you'd let
us use your face for free.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.166
Oh, no, well, you thought wrong.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.750
Hot looks cost money.

17:17.834 --> 17:20.041

salaries through our LLC,

17:25.834 --> 17:27.834
so technically,
we're not making a profit.

17:27.917 --> 17:28.917
Mm.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.417
Let's make it 30%.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.959
Partners?

17:33.041 --> 17:34.083
(chuckles)

17:37.625 --> 17:40.875
Mmm. Now I know
what kombucha is. (chuckles)

17:40.959 --> 17:44.291
All this time I thought
it was a Japanese puppet show.

17:44.375 --> 17:45.750
Uh, Pop-Pop,
what're you doing here?

17:45.834 --> 17:47.166
I'm here to move meat.

17:48.458 --> 17:52.792
Hey, there. Try Pop Pop's
Old Fashioned Plan Beef.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.625
Proven health benefits.

17:54.709 --> 17:56.041
Stimulates hair growth.

17:56.125 --> 17:58.000
Here, check out the results,
huh?

17:58.083 --> 18:00.792
Ma'am. Loosens you up
if you're clogged,

18:00.875 --> 18:03.500
-and it clogs you up
if you're loose.
-Ugh.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.709
Pop-Pop, you can't make promises
the beef can't keep.

18:05.792 --> 18:07.458
Yeah. That's why we like
to tell people

18:07.542 --> 18:09.959
that it's not that good for you,
but it tastes really good.

18:10.041 --> 18:11.208
And they respect that.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.667
Wh-What good is their respect?

18:12.750 --> 18:14.291
You want their money.

18:14.375 --> 18:16.667
Uh, we want a product
that is meaningful

18:16.750 --> 18:18.792
and creates a dialogue
with our fellow humans.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.083
You don't even sound
like a human.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.041
Hey, well,
why don't you just take a seat

18:23.125 --> 18:25.792
and be the face of the company?

18:25.875 --> 18:27.917
And let Clementine
and me take the lead.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.000
That coffee you made
this morning

18:32.083 --> 18:33.625
was seriously pretty good.

18:33.709 --> 18:34.875
It, like, woke me up.

18:34.959 --> 18:36.792
Aw. I love coffee.

18:36.875 --> 18:38.417
What the hell are you two doing?

18:38.500 --> 18:41.166
Oh, we're just enjoying
each other's company.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.834
You have to like
what you do, Pop-Pop,

18:42.917 --> 18:44.333
-otherwise,
it's not worth doing.
-Hmm.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.792
You're not even looking up
at your customers.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.125
That's right. They can tell

18:48.208 --> 18:49.667
that we're so confident
in our product,

18:49.750 --> 18:50.917
we don't need to pressure them.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.375
Well, that's crazy.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.500
Selling is all about
smoke and mirrors.

18:54.583 --> 18:57.291
If you're good,
you can sell sex to a nun.

18:57.375 --> 18:58.583
You just need a gimmick.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.250
You got to listen to me.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.875
Actually, we don't.

19:01.959 --> 19:04.417
As majority shareholders,
we control the vote.

19:04.500 --> 19:07.333
And we vote for you
to sit there and look good.

19:07.417 --> 19:12.166
Well, I'm sick of being treated
like a piece of meat.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.208
Beauty's a curse, Tank.

19:17.917 --> 19:19.500
Even though I'm scuba diving,

19:19.583 --> 19:22.458
you can put a rain cloud
above my head.

19:22.542 --> 19:24.208
That's my inner mood.

19:24.291 --> 19:28.458
Hey. Look what I stole
for us, Tanky.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.083
-(Tank barks)
-No, not now.

19:30.166 --> 19:32.750
My girl's got to turn a trick
for us first.

19:32.834 --> 19:35.667
(laughing):
There we go.

19:37.417 --> 19:38.875
There you go.

19:38.959 --> 19:40.041
Cute.

19:40.125 --> 19:42.625
She'll do anything
for this jerky.

19:42.709 --> 19:44.208
No, not me. The meat.

19:44.291 --> 19:46.583
Me, I'm-I'm her sweetheart.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.917
Maybe jerky isn't
the next cupcake.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.750
Maybe it's fruit leather.

19:51.834 --> 19:55.041
Or maybe it's just
more cupcakes.

19:55.125 --> 19:57.166
What about
a jerky-flavored cupcake?

19:57.250 --> 20:00.959
I'm cashing out my share.

20:02.333 --> 20:04.750
Good girl!

20:04.834 --> 20:07.583
Paw Paw's Old Fashioned
Plan Beef, the only treat

20:07.667 --> 20:09.917
you can share
with your best friend.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.583
-Tank. Speak! (laughs)
-(barks)

20:12.667 --> 20:14.208
Good for dogs,

20:14.291 --> 20:16.041
good for cats;
who cares about birds?

20:16.125 --> 20:17.792
Puts a shine on their coats,

20:17.875 --> 20:21.417
freshens their breath
and it's birth control.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.458
Are you selling our jerky
to dogs?

20:23.542 --> 20:25.458
Oh, we got a hit.

20:25.542 --> 20:26.542
And I need more product.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.333
How much you got left?
Thank you.

20:28.417 --> 20:29.709
Um, all of it.

20:29.792 --> 20:32.875
You should have listened
to the old man, I guess. Huh?

20:32.959 --> 20:34.500
Do you think you could
maybe cut us in?

20:34.583 --> 20:36.542
Sure, I'll give you a 20% stake.

20:36.625 --> 20:38.291
Is that net or gross?

20:38.375 --> 20:41.417
Well, if you can tell me the
difference, I'll give you 50%.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.792
20 it is.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.166
-Partners?
-Partners.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.333
-Partners.
-(chuckles)

20:47.417 --> 20:49.250
Now, get out of here.
You're bad for business.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.125
Beat it.

20:51.208 --> 20:54.125
-There you go.
-Thank you.

20:54.208 --> 20:56.250
Got two more left!
