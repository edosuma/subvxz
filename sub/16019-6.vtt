06:01.528 --> 06:04.447
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT A BOOB JOB.

06:04.489 --> 06:08.409
I NEED ADULT INTERACTION.

06:04.489 --> 06:08.409
I HAVEN'T SHOWERED IN FOUR DAYS.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.870
I'M A MILK MONSTER.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.412
LOOK AT MY ROOTS!

06:11.454 --> 06:12.622
(cell phone rings)

06:12.664 --> 06:13.874
NO! THE BABIES!

06:13.915 --> 06:17.044
OH. OOH.

06:13.915 --> 06:17.044
IT'S A PRIVATE CALLER.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.837
OH.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.837
THIS MIGHT BE IT. HELLO?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.588
SCROTUM!

06:20.630 --> 06:23.258
OH. HI, AUNT NANCY.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.385
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY SHOULD STOP

06:23.300 --> 06:26.385
CALLING FROM A BLOCKED NUMBER.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.640
DO WE GO IN

06:28.096 --> 06:30.640
OR DO WE JUST WAIT OUT HERE?

06:30.682 --> 06:32.226
WHAT'S THE ETIQUETTE?

06:32.267 --> 06:34.644
I LOVE ROCKING CHAIRS.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.730
I HAVE TWO IN MY APARTMENT--

06:36.771 --> 06:38.439
ONE IN THE LIVING ROOM

06:38.481 --> 06:40.901
AND ONE IN THE BATHROOM.

06:40.942 --> 06:44.154
YOU WOULDN'T THINK IT WOULD

06:40.942 --> 06:44.154
GET MUCH USE IN THERE,

06:44.196 --> 06:45.488
BUT IT DOES.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.491
MM. (chuckles)

06:48.533 --> 06:50.451
IT SMELLS LIKE POO

06:48.533 --> 06:50.451
IN THIS HOUSE.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.661
WELL, WHY DON'T

06:50.493 --> 06:51.661
WE JUST YELL "CUT"

06:51.703 --> 06:53.705
AND HAVE THEM

06:51.703 --> 06:53.705
TAKE THE BABIES AWAY? CUT.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.832
KATARINA, WOULD YOU MIND

06:53.747 --> 06:55.832
IF I BORROWED YOUR BICYCLE?

06:55.874 --> 06:57.542
I'D LOVE TO GO BIRD-WATCHING.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.253
HELP YOURSELF...

06:59.294 --> 07:01.922
TO THE BIKE AND ANYTHING ELSE

06:59.294 --> 07:01.922
I USED TO ENJOY.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.631
YEAH! BENDER!

07:03.673 --> 07:04.841
(baby crying)

07:03.673 --> 07:04.841
NO!

07:04.883 --> 07:08.469
(object thuds)

07:04.883 --> 07:08.469
(whispers) NO.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.640
OKAY. SO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED

07:09.971 --> 07:12.640
THIS MAP,

07:12.682 --> 07:15.269
BINOCULARS, A WHISTLE,

07:15.310 --> 07:17.979
SUNSCREEN,

07:15.310 --> 07:17.979
A MOSQUITO NETTING--

07:18.021 --> 07:20.690
I DON'T NEED MOSQUITO NETTING.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.690
I'M JUST GOING BIRD-WATCHING.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.859
AH. OKAY. UM...

07:22.901 --> 07:24.194
(under breath) WEST NILE.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.486
WHAT?

07:25.528 --> 07:28.740
OH, NOTHING. JUST ASKING

07:25.528 --> 07:28.740
IF YOU WANT TO DIE.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.991
JUNE?

07:30.033 --> 07:33.161
MARK! HEY!

07:30.033 --> 07:33.161
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:33.203 --> 07:34.788
JENNIFER WANTED A ROMANTIC

07:33.203 --> 07:34.788
WEEKEND IN THE HAMPTONS

07:34.829 --> 07:36.539
SO WE BORROWED

07:34.829 --> 07:36.539
HER PARENTS' HOUSE.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.542
WE'RE SLEEPING IN THEIR BED.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.542
IT'S NOT WEIRD AT ALL.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.795
OH.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.795
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:41.836 --> 07:43.004
AREN'T YOU WAITING

07:41.836 --> 07:43.004
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT JOB?

07:43.046 --> 07:46.216
OH, YEAH, WELL, I HAVE

07:43.046 --> 07:46.216
MY PHONE WITH ME, SO...

07:46.258 --> 07:47.717

07:46.258 --> 07:47.717
YOU KNOW.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.094
OH. I BETTER HURRY.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.012
JENNIFER DOESN'T LIKE

07:49.136 --> 07:51.012
WHEN I SHOP MOM AND POP.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.722
SHE THINKS THE FOOD

07:51.054 --> 07:52.722
GETS DUSTY.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.557
SO SEE YA.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.557
(horn honks)

07:54.599 --> 07:56.517
OKAY.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.228
(dog barks)

07:58.270 --> 07:59.479
(whines)

08:03.817 --> 08:05.319
GREAT CAPRIS.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.528
EXCUSE... ME?

08:07.570 --> 08:09.323
LOOK AT ME--A BOW TIE.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.824
I'M FULL OF REGRET

08:09.364 --> 08:10.824
AND SELF-LOATHING,

08:10.865 --> 08:13.534
BUT YOU, YOU'RE SO BOLD.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.245
YOU'RE AHEAD OF THE CURVE.

08:15.287 --> 08:18.373
OR I'M JUST WEARING PAJAMAS

08:15.287 --> 08:18.373
AND A SWEATER THAT I BORROWED.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.250
PRESTO. INSTANT SUCCESS.

08:20.292 --> 08:23.795
I'M WILLOUGHBY,

08:20.292 --> 08:23.795

08:31.594 --> 08:34.348
THIS IS A RIDDLE INVITATION

08:31.594 --> 08:34.348

08:34.389 --> 08:36.557
WHAT DO YOU THINK

08:34.389 --> 08:36.557
OF THE FONT?

08:36.599 --> 08:38.935
YOU WOULD'VE PICKED

08:36.599 --> 08:38.935
A DIFFERENT ONE.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.479
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

08:41.604 --> 08:42.605
(crow caws)

08:42.647 --> 08:44.732
(snoring)

08:44.774 --> 08:47.610
I GUESS WE'RE ALL JUST ONE

08:44.774 --> 08:47.610
SMALL HOLE IN THE CONDOM AWAY

08:47.652 --> 08:50.155
FROM HAVING OUR LIVES

08:47.652 --> 08:50.155
TOTALLY DESTROYED.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.240
(sighs)

08:52.282 --> 08:55.743
CHLOE, I GOT SOME PRETTY SERIOUS

08:52.282 --> 08:55.743
SOUL SEARCHING TO DO.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.788
I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE

08:55.785 --> 08:58.788
TO TAKE THIS BENDER SOLO.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.749
YOU GOTTA FOLLOW THE BENDER.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.749
I UNDERSTAND.

09:01.791 --> 09:05.670
IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE TRUDGING

09:01.791 --> 09:05.670
DOWN A QUIET HAMPTONS ROAD...

09:05.712 --> 09:07.464
ALONE.

09:09.841 --> 09:10.675
(continues snoring)

09:10.717 --> 09:12.052
WAKE UP, BITCH.

09:12.093 --> 09:15.263
(birds chirping)

09:31.946 --> 09:35.158
I JUST WORRY ABOUT YOUR ARCHES

09:31.946 --> 09:35.158
IN THOSE SHOES.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.915
(door opens and closes)

09:40.372 --> 09:41.915
PERFECT.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.500
SO I JUST MET WILLOUGHBY.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.418
WHAT?

09:44.459 --> 09:46.794
OH, MY GOD!

09:44.459 --> 09:46.794
A WILLOUGHBY RIDDLE.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.796
"ON THIS DAY OCCURRED

09:46.836 --> 09:48.796
A LOVE MASSACRE,

09:48.838 --> 09:51.258
"WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK

09:48.838 --> 09:51.258
A MANIC GAY ACTOR

09:51.299 --> 09:52.926
WHO DOES NOT LIKE

09:51.299 --> 09:52.926
TO WORK SUBTLE."

09:52.967 --> 09:54.844
IT'S HIS NEW ADDRESS

09:52.967 --> 09:54.844
OR SOMETHING.

09:54.886 --> 09:56.804
(gasps) THE VALENTINE'S DAY

09:54.886 --> 09:56.804
MASSACRE WAS FEBRUARY 14th.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.306
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.518
I'M INSTANTLY PICTURING

09:58.348 --> 10:01.518
A GRANDFATHER CLOCK. OH!

10:01.560 --> 10:03.811
WHO IS THAT ACTOR WHO I THOUGHT

10:01.560 --> 10:03.811

10:03.853 --> 10:05.813
OH! OH! OH! NATHAN LANE!

10:08.066 --> 10:10.651
OF THE PARTY. WE'RE SO GOING.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.695
OH, I'M SORRY. I CAN'T.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.695
I HAVE TO GET UP SUPER EARLY.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.449
I'M GOING TO GET, UH,

10:12.737 --> 10:15.449
SCONES AT MAUDE'S.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.825
THEY RUN OUT OF THE BLUE--

10:17.867 --> 10:19.869

10:19.911 --> 10:22.914
(spits) JUNE, YOU HAVE TO GO

10:19.911 --> 10:22.914
WHERE THE BENDER TAKES YOU,

10:22.956 --> 10:24.707
AND I AM TELLING YOU,

10:22.956 --> 10:24.707
YOUR BENDER IS

10:24.749 --> 10:26.667
TAKING YOU

10:24.749 --> 10:26.667
TO WILLOUGHBY'S PARTY,

10:26.709 --> 10:28.253
WHERE YOU WILL INTRODUCE ME

10:26.709 --> 10:28.253

10:28.295 --> 10:30.046
AND I WILL MEET HIM

10:28.295 --> 10:30.046
AND I WILL BANG HIM.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.672
WELL, WHAT IF MY BENDER WAS

10:30.088 --> 10:31.672
TAKING ME

10:31.714 --> 10:33.925
TO DO A SUNSET TOUR

10:31.714 --> 10:33.925
OF THE CRANBERRY BOGS?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.303
UGH! YOU ARE

10:33.967 --> 10:36.303
THE WORST BENDER-ER EVER.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.554
YOU MIGHT AS WELL

10:36.344 --> 10:37.554
HAVE JUST STAYED HOME

10:37.596 --> 10:39.680
AND STARED AT YOUR PHONE

10:37.596 --> 10:39.680
ON THE COFFEE TABLE.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.475
(beep)

10:39.722 --> 10:41.475
NO ONE'S CALLED

10:39.722 --> 10:41.475
SINCE AUNT NANCY.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.684
EXACTLY. SO RELAX.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.684
COME ON.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.313
THERE IS A FABULOUS PARTY

10:43.726 --> 10:46.313
WITH OUR NAMES ON IT.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.689
I'M SURE YOU COULD BORROW

10:46.354 --> 10:48.689
SOMETHING TO WEAR OF KATARINA'S.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.733
I KNOW.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.733
SOMETHING WITH A CROTCH.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.778
CHLOE ASKED ME

10:50.775 --> 10:53.778
TO LOOK AFTER JAMES.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.822
SHE DEPUTIZED ME...

10:56.906 --> 10:59.700
WITH HER EYES,

10:56.906 --> 10:59.700
NOT WITH HER WORDS.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.077
(horn honks)

11:01.119 --> 11:03.371
YEAH! PASS ME!

11:01.119 --> 11:03.371
LOOK AT YOU GO!

11:03.413 --> 11:07.167
YOU'RE AN ASIAN-AMERICAN

11:03.413 --> 11:07.167
DRIVING POORLY,

11:07.208 --> 11:11.712
AND I'M AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN

11:07.208 --> 11:11.712
SITTING IN THE BACK OF THE BUS,

11:11.754 --> 11:13.089
BOTH CHASING

11:13.131 --> 11:15.008
A DISTANT WHITE MAN.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.008
(high-pitched squeak)

11:15.049 --> 11:18.928
THIS IS NOT WHY MY MOTHER

11:15.049 --> 11:18.928
MARCHED ON WASHINGTON.

11:18.970 --> 11:22.723
OH, SWEET FREEDOM,

11:18.970 --> 11:22.723
WHERE IS JAMES?

11:22.765 --> 11:25.393
(grunts)

11:26.811 --> 11:29.772
COFFEE GUY?

11:26.811 --> 11:29.772
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.566
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:31.608 --> 11:33.734
WELL, I HEARD

11:31.608 --> 11:33.734
A-A HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAK.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.278
I THOUGHT A LITTLE GIRL

11:33.776 --> 11:35.278
WAS IN TROUBLE.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.781
IT WAS MY GIRLFRIEND JENNIFER.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.826
SHE BROKE UP WITH ME AGAIN,

11:38.823 --> 11:41.826
THIS TIME FOR GOOD.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.786
SHE THOUGHT I WAS GONNA

11:41.868 --> 11:43.786
PROPOSE TO HER THIS WEEKEND,

11:43.828 --> 11:45.997
SO SHE KEPT LOOKING

11:43.828 --> 11:45.997
FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING

11:46.039 --> 11:47.165
IN EVERYTHING I HANDED HER.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.834
SHE TORE APART A PINECONE

11:47.207 --> 11:49.834
WITH HER BARE HANDS.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.252
(Luther) JAMES!

11:51.294 --> 11:52.629
JAMES!

11:52.671 --> 11:53.754
I SEE YOU'RE ON A BENDER.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.798
I, TOO, AM TRYING

11:53.796 --> 11:55.798
TO DRINK MY PAIN AWAY.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.842
I THOUGHT I WANTED TO DO

11:55.840 --> 11:57.842
THE LONELY BENDER,

11:57.884 --> 12:00.845
BUT THE QUIET

11:57.884 --> 12:00.845
JUST MAKES IT WORSE.

12:00.887 --> 12:01.971
(Luther) JAMES!

12:02.013 --> 12:04.391
MY LONELY ROAD

12:02.013 --> 12:04.391
HAS BROUGHT ME TO YOU.

12:04.432 --> 12:07.185
I THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

12:04.432 --> 12:07.185
BENDER BUDDIES.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.063
(clink)

12:10.104 --> 12:11.814
(Luther, singsongy)

12:10.104 --> 12:11.814
I HAVE COOKIES!

12:11.856 --> 12:13.483
(blows nose)

12:13.525 --> 12:16.027
EXCUSE ME. POLLEN.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.614
(woman) ♪ OH ♪

12:19.656 --> 12:22.075
GOD, PUT THAT PIE AWAY.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.075
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

12:22.116 --> 12:24.452
IT'S MY HOST GIFT.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.452
EVERY TIME YOU TRY

12:24.494 --> 12:26.871
TO SLAP IT OUT OF MY HANDS,

12:24.494 --> 12:26.871
IT ONLY MAKES ME GRIP IT HARDER.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.956
OKAY, WHERE'S WILLOUGHBY?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.956
I WANT TO FIND HIM

12:28.998 --> 12:30.417
AND SEX HIM

12:28.998 --> 12:30.417
AND THEN HAVE A MARTINI.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.793
OH, I JUST HAD

12:30.458 --> 12:32.793
ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS

12:32.835 --> 12:34.504
WHERE I REALIZE

12:32.835 --> 12:34.504
WHAT A GREAT GIRL I AM.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.173
WOW! THIS HOUSE IS AMAZING!

12:37.215 --> 12:38.799
AND I LOVE THIS DRESS

12:37.215 --> 12:38.799
OF KATARINA'S.

12:38.841 --> 12:42.011
IT'S TIGHT, BUT I GET IT.

12:38.841 --> 12:42.011
IT EVEN HAS A COOL PHONE POCKET.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.055
OH, MY GOD!

12:42.053 --> 12:44.055
KATARINA'S PILL POCKET!

12:44.097 --> 12:45.973
A LOT OF GOOD TIMES

12:44.097 --> 12:45.973
IN THAT POCKET.

12:46.015 --> 12:46.807
A LOT OF MEMORIES.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.810
OH, NO. OH, NO.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.810
THERE'S NO BARS.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.688
THERE'S NO SIGNAL.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.398
KATARINA SHOULD'VE USED

12:51.730 --> 12:53.398
THAT POCKET

12:53.440 --> 12:54.815
FOR SOME BIRTH CONTROL PILLS.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.984
HA HA HA HA! THAT'S HILARIOUS!

12:57.026 --> 12:59.613
I'M GONNA TEXT HER THAT

12:57.026 --> 12:59.613
RIGHT NOW.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.822
(indistinct conversations

12:59.654 --> 13:01.822
in distance)

13:01.864 --> 13:03.283
BOO.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.284
WILLOUGHBY.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.994
'TIS I, JUNE.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.994
'TIS WILLOUGHBY.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.204
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?

13:08.246 --> 13:09.830
I ACTUALLY HATE PARTIES.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.541
I JUST LIKE

13:09.872 --> 13:11.541
TO FIND A DARK CORNER

13:11.583 --> 13:14.210
AND WATCH ALL THE PUPPETS DANCE

13:11.583 --> 13:14.210
FROM AFAR.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.420
IS THAT A PIE?

13:15.462 --> 13:18.256
OH. YES!

13:15.462 --> 13:18.256
THIS IS FOR YOU.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.007
YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE

13:18.298 --> 13:20.007
HAVE BEEN TO MY PARTIES

13:20.049 --> 13:21.008
OVER THE YEARS?

13:21.050 --> 13:23.010
5,342.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.845
YOU WANNA KNOW

13:23.052 --> 13:24.845
HOW I KNOW THAT?

13:24.887 --> 13:27.432
IT'S THIS ANTIQUE CLICKER.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.432
(click)

13:27.474 --> 13:29.517
YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE

13:27.474 --> 13:29.517
EVER BROUGHT ME A PIE?

13:29.559 --> 13:30.727
ZERO.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.688
GO DOWNSTAIRS

13:30.769 --> 13:33.688
AND GET US TWO PASTRY FORKS.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.316
I'VE GOT SOMETHING IMPORTANT

13:33.730 --> 13:36.316
I NEED TO SAY.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.319
(dance music playing)

13:39.360 --> 13:42.322
EXCUSE ME. CAN I HAVE

13:39.360 --> 13:42.322
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

13:42.363 --> 13:43.948
(raises voice) EXCUSE ME!

13:43.990 --> 13:45.866
(normal voice) EXCUSE ME.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.076
(plays notes)

13:45.908 --> 13:47.076
ZING!

13:48.787 --> 13:51.372
I... AM WILLOUGHBY!

13:51.414 --> 13:52.707
(guests gasp)

13:52.749 --> 13:54.875
BERNARD, WHAT THE HELL

13:52.749 --> 13:54.875
ARE YOU DOING?!

13:54.917 --> 13:56.085
YOU'RE NOT WILLOUGHBY!

13:56.127 --> 13:57.920
CHLOE, WHAT ARE

13:56.127 --> 13:57.920
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:57.962 --> 13:59.046
THAT IS WILLOUGHBY.

13:59.088 --> 14:02.091
NO, THAT'S BERNARD,

13:59.088 --> 14:02.091
MY HUSBAND.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.135
(guests murmur)

14:02.133 --> 14:04.135
(door slams)

14:07.930 --> 14:09.056
WHAT DO YOU MEAN

14:07.930 --> 14:09.056
HE'S YOUR HUSBAND?

14:09.098 --> 14:11.892
I MEAN HE'S MY HUSBAND.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.892
WE GOT MARRIED

14:11.934 --> 14:14.187
AT A WEDDING PARTY

14:11.934 --> 14:14.187
WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO NEW YORK.

14:14.228 --> 14:17.565
HA HA! THIS PARTY IS AWESOME!

14:17.607 --> 14:19.693
PEOPLE ARE

14:17.607 --> 14:19.693
GETTING MARRIED UPSTAIRS.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.528
WE SHOULD

14:19.734 --> 14:21.528
TOTALLY GET MARRIED.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.697
OH, MY GOD! I THOUGHT

14:21.569 --> 14:23.697
YOU WERE GAY! OKAY!

14:23.738 --> 14:25.198
(cheering)

14:25.239 --> 14:26.907
I MET HIM THAT NIGHT

14:25.239 --> 14:26.907
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.910
HONESTLY, I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.910
I SAW SOME NEWS REPORT

14:29.952 --> 14:31.579
ABOUT A SKINNY GUY

14:29.952 --> 14:31.579
WHO GOT HIT BY A GARBAGE TRUCK,

14:31.621 --> 14:34.081
AND I FIGURED, WELP,

14:31.621 --> 14:34.081
I'M A WIDOW NOW.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.166
HELLO, WIFE.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.626
(Chloe scoffs)

14:36.668 --> 14:38.085
I STILL THINK

14:36.668 --> 14:38.085
OF YOU DAILY.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.713
BERNARD, WHAT THE HELL

14:38.127 --> 14:39.713
ARE YOU DOING?

14:39.754 --> 14:40.963
YOU'RE NOT WILLOUGHBY.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.591
I THOUGHT WILLOUGHBY WAS

14:41.005 --> 14:43.591
A COSMOPOLITAN MAN OF MYSTERY.

14:43.633 --> 14:44.925
IT'S JUST YOU?

14:44.967 --> 14:46.511
EXACTLY. JUST ME,

14:46.553 --> 14:48.847
BERNARD KOPPELMAN,

14:46.553 --> 14:48.847
A FORMER FAT TEENAGER

14:48.888 --> 14:50.724
WHO STILL SWIMS

14:48.888 --> 14:50.724
WITH HIS T-SHIRT ON.

14:50.765 --> 14:54.935
THANK YOU, JUNE, FOR EXPLODING

14:50.765 --> 14:54.935
THIS PRISON OF MY OWN CREATION.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.647
I-I HAVE

14:54.977 --> 14:57.647
A-A-A LOT OF QUESTIONS,

14:57.689 --> 14:59.940
BUT RIGHT NOW, I WAS GONNA ASK

14:57.689 --> 14:59.940
YOU, MAY I BORROW YOUR LAPTOP?

14:59.982 --> 15:02.193
I NEED TO ACCESS MY VOICEMAIL

14:59.982 --> 15:02.193
OVER THE INTERNET.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.112
YEAH, I DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.112
THEY'RE DISGUSTING.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.947
BUT I DO HAVE A VINTAGE

15:05.154 --> 15:06.947
TYPEWRITER COLLECTION

15:06.989 --> 15:08.658
IN CASE YOU WANT

15:06.989 --> 15:08.658
TO COMPOSE A SONNET.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.993
(cries)

15:11.035 --> 15:12.871
(basketball thuds)

15:12.912 --> 15:14.914
OKAY.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.958
OH! YOU GOT THE SUNGLASSES.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.958
THAT'S A FOUL.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.126
MY BAD. I--

15:19.168 --> 15:22.046
STEAL.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.965
(bottles clatter)

15:25.007 --> 15:27.968
"DANCING WITH THE STARS" IS

15:25.007 --> 15:27.968
HAUNTING ME.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.970
YOU SEE, I PRACTICED,

15:30.012 --> 15:32.223
I WAS--I WAS--I WAS...

15:32.265 --> 15:34.475
READY.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.561
I DIDN'T GET

15:34.517 --> 15:36.561
A CHANCE TO DO IT.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.187
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE?

15:38.229 --> 15:40.147
YOU HAVE PERFORMANCE

15:38.229 --> 15:40.147
SQUELCHINGS, BROTHER.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.818
I MEAN, YOU'RE TRAPPED

15:40.189 --> 15:43.818
IN A BAG WITH MEMORY CATS.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.904
YOU GOTTA PUNCH YOUR WAY

15:43.860 --> 15:45.904
OUT OF IT.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.072
I HAD A...

15:48.114 --> 15:51.158
I HAD A CHANCE TO DAZZLE,

15:48.114 --> 15:51.158
YOU KNOW, AND...

15:51.200 --> 15:52.993
IT GOT TAKEN AWAY FROM ME.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.036
WHO CARES, MAN?

15:54.078 --> 15:56.163
MAKE YOUR OWN OPPORTUNITY,

15:54.078 --> 15:56.163
JAMES.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.917
YOU WANT TO DANCE,

15:56.205 --> 15:58.917
THEN DANCE.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.086
WE JUST GOTTA FIND YOU

15:58.958 --> 16:02.086
A FLOOR.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.212
OW! DUDE!

16:03.254 --> 16:05.172
CHLOE JUST TEXTED ME

16:03.254 --> 16:05.172
WILLOUGHBY'S ADDRESS.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.800
WILLOUGHBY HAS A FLOOR.

16:06.841 --> 16:09.385
YEAH! YEAH!

16:09.427 --> 16:11.011
WHOA!

16:11.053 --> 16:12.012
SO CLOSE.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.181
SO CLOSE.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.644
(dance music playing)

16:17.685 --> 16:20.020
I WENT UP ON THE ROOF WITH

16:17.685 --> 16:20.020
WILLOUGHBY

16:20.062 --> 16:21.940
AND GOT A SIGNAL.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.940
NO MESSAGES.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.275
ALSO, HE SAID THAT

16:22.022 --> 16:24.275
YOUR MARRIAGE WASN'T LEGAL.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.319
THE PRIEST WAS SOME CLUB KID

16:24.317 --> 16:26.319
NAMED STINKLORD

16:26.360 --> 16:29.029
WHO HAD A TATTOO

16:26.360 --> 16:29.029
OF A CROSS ON HIS NECK.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.115
(ice rattles)

16:31.157 --> 16:32.742
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

16:32.784 --> 16:36.036
WILLOUGHBY WAS ONE OF THE LAST

16:32.784 --> 16:36.036
NEW EXPERIENCES I HAD LEFT,

16:36.078 --> 16:39.039
AND IT TURNS OUT I MARRIED HIM

16:36.078 --> 16:39.039
SIX YEARS AGO.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.043
THERE ARE NO NEW MOUNTAINS

16:40.291 --> 16:43.043
TO CLIMB, JUNE.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.504
I'VE SEEN IT ALL.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.132
(sighs deeply)

16:45.922 --> 16:48.132
EXCEPT MAYBE THIS.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.260

17:30.758 --> 17:33.093

17:30.758 --> 17:33.093
HAS BEEN TO EVERY PARTY,

17:33.135 --> 17:35.304
WHAT'S NEXT FOR HER?

17:35.346 --> 17:37.765
GOOD LORD, JUNE, YOU'RE,

17:35.346 --> 17:37.765
LIKE, OBSESSED WITH HER.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.519
WHERE IS SHE GOING?

17:39.392 --> 17:41.519
SHE SHOULDN'T BE ALONE.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.812
(James) LEAVE HER BE, JUNE.

17:42.854 --> 17:45.189
NO! SHE NEEDS HER FRIENDS.

17:42.854 --> 17:45.189
(brakes squeal)

17:45.231 --> 17:48.026
CHLOE!

17:48.067 --> 17:49.193
CHLOE!

17:49.235 --> 17:51.821
IT'S OKAY!

17:51.863 --> 17:53.489
IT'S OKAY!

17:53.531 --> 17:56.158
HI. I'M HAVING SEX.

17:53.531 --> 17:56.158
GIVE ME 15 MINUTES.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.869
(man grunts)

17:56.200 --> 17:57.869
(door slams)

18:04.042 --> 18:06.335
(Chloe giggles)

18:06.377 --> 18:07.378
HI!

18:07.420 --> 18:09.422
CHLOE,

18:07.420 --> 18:09.422
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:09.463 --> 18:10.506
OH, EVERY YEAR

18:09.463 --> 18:10.506
WHEN I'M IN THE HAMPTONS,

18:10.548 --> 18:12.383
I HAVE SEX IN THE BUSHES

18:10.548 --> 18:12.383
WITH LENNY KRAVITZ.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.760
HE TEXTED ME EARLIER.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.428
I DON'T KNOW WHY

18:13.801 --> 18:15.428
YOU KEEP COMPLAINING

18:15.469 --> 18:17.931
ABOUT YOUR CELL PHONE SERVICE,

18:15.469 --> 18:17.931
'CAUSE MINE'S FINE.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.058
SO YOU'RE OKAY

18:17.972 --> 18:20.058
WITH ALL OF THIS?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.727
WELL, WHEN I WAS HAVING SEX

18:20.099 --> 18:22.727
WITH LENNY, I WAS THINKING,

18:22.769 --> 18:24.771
I'VE HAD SEX WITH HIM

18:22.769 --> 18:24.771
FOR FIVE YEARS IN A ROW,

18:24.812 --> 18:26.146
AND IT'S STILL GREAT.

18:26.188 --> 18:29.067
JUST BECAUSE I'VE DONE IT BEFORE

18:26.188 --> 18:29.067
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT AWESOME.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.944
(laughs)

18:30.985 --> 18:32.319
SHE'S A PARTY GIRL, JUNE.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.530
WE LOST A LOT OF GOOD

18:32.361 --> 18:34.530
PARTY GIRLS ALONG THE WAY.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.198
WE'RE NOT GONNA LOSE

18:34.572 --> 18:36.198
THIS ONE.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.367
AAH! DON'T GET ALL

18:36.240 --> 18:38.367
SENTIMENTAL ON ME, JAMES.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.411
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.411
YOU WANT TO SHOW ME YOU CARE,

18:40.453 --> 18:42.162
BUY ME AN ISLAND.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.162
(cell phone alert chimes)

18:42.204 --> 18:44.164
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

18:44.206 --> 18:46.166
(chime)

18:44.206 --> 18:46.166
OH, THAT IS

18:44.206 --> 18:46.166
A VOICEMAIL NOISE.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.045
THAT IS A VOICEMAIL NOISE.
