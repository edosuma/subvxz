00:05.547 --> 00:06.980
<i>Previously on "Graves"...</i>

00:06.982 --> 00:09.549
Did you read that article
in slate online?

00:09.551 --> 00:12.252
<i>"Richard graves,
worst president in history."</i>

00:12.254 --> 00:15.055
This is your new assistant
Isaiah miller. Hi.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.657
<i>News of former first daughter
Olivia graves'</i>

00:17.659 --> 00:20.427
<i>Marriage dissolution
has been confirmed.</i>

00:20.429 --> 00:22.195
Bring your car around back.

00:22.197 --> 00:23.930
We're slipping out today.

00:23.932 --> 00:25.732
<i>Seems big bird found
his way to his library</i>

00:25.734 --> 00:27.567
<i>And did some redecorating.</i>

00:27.569 --> 00:30.804
You're out here getting high with
some random waitress you just met.

00:30.806 --> 00:32.572
<i>There's no way
that was on the books.</i>

00:32.573 --> 00:35.041
President graves.
Now you want the truth.

00:35.043 --> 00:38.979
<i>All right, the truth.</i>

00:38.981 --> 00:41.414
And this breaking news.
CNN just learned

00:41.416 --> 00:44.117
The furlough hearing
for Martin Treadwell,

00:44.119 --> 00:46.553
<i>President Richard graves'
would-be assassin,</i>

00:46.555 --> 00:48.588
<i>Will be held in 30 days.</i>

00:48.590 --> 00:51.691
<i>This is Treadwell's first release
request to be considered</i>

00:51.693 --> 00:53.893
Since his attempt
on the president's life.

00:53.895 --> 00:57.831
This is the last thing
I need now today.

00:57.833 --> 01:01.167
Really, the last fucking thing.

01:01.169 --> 01:03.937
Isaiah, I don't want him to read
the paper or watch the news today.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.106
Jacob, what's happening
with the president's library?

01:06.108 --> 01:08.375
Being repaired. Should be
up and open in two weeks.

01:08.377 --> 01:10.110
Still can't believe it.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.679
All right, Richard's been
asleep for 12 hours now,

01:12.681 --> 01:14.681
Which is great because
I want him to rest.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.216
I'm seriously worried about him.

01:16.218 --> 01:19.019
I want him doing nothing
but relaxing, Isaiah.

01:19.021 --> 01:21.755
Yes, ma'am.
Good morning, sweetheart.

01:21.757 --> 01:24.324
<i>Would you like a bowl
for that, darling?</i>

01:24.326 --> 01:26.192
A spoon perhaps?

01:27.929 --> 01:29.896
Ma'am, we should sign
these before we go.

01:29.898 --> 01:31.765
For the mothers of veterans.

01:31.767 --> 01:35.368
Oh, which reminds me, Isaiah,
one more thing, please.

01:35.370 --> 01:38.405
Later on, the president has to face time...
With your son Jeremy.

01:38.407 --> 01:40.273
From his army base
in Afghanistan.

01:40.275 --> 01:43.343
So Richard cannot be late.
He is always late.

01:43.345 --> 01:44.844
You get him there.
Okay.

01:44.846 --> 01:46.513
Jeremy's coming home
in a few days,

01:46.515 --> 01:47.947
Which is to say
I'm a nervous wreck.

01:47.949 --> 01:50.183
Face time with Jeremy,
no Treadwell, got it.

01:50.185 --> 01:52.752
Ramona, I'm assuming you're
getting Jeremy's room ready.

01:52.754 --> 01:54.854
Of course,
Mrs. Graves.

01:54.856 --> 01:58.058
Okay, all I need
is the sky not to fall.

01:58.060 --> 02:01.761
And by the sky
I mean my husband.

02:40.302 --> 02:42.435
<i>And now the man
who pulled the trigger,</i>

02:42.437 --> 02:45.805
Martin Treadwell, who has spent every
day since in a mental health...

02:45.807 --> 02:48.575
Good morning, sir.
You look rested.

02:48.577 --> 02:52.846
Oh, I feel rested.
How are you, Isaiah?

02:52.848 --> 02:56.049
You actually said my name.

02:56.051 --> 02:59.519
It's the little things, right?

02:59.521 --> 03:01.788
Yes, sir.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.090
Ramona, what's wrong?

03:04.092 --> 03:07.861
Gerardo wants to leave early for
his daughter's QuinceaÃ±era.

03:07.863 --> 03:09.929
<i>Half the day, Mr. Graves.</i>

03:09.931 --> 03:13.566
Well, let him.
It's fine. It's okay.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.402
Okay.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.908
I hear Livy's home.

03:42.497 --> 03:45.899
So, how we holding up?

03:45.901 --> 03:48.501
I don't know, daddy.

03:48.503 --> 03:50.203
It's the worst.

03:51.506 --> 03:55.175
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.679
You were always way,
way too good for that guy.

03:59.681 --> 04:01.481
You know?

04:01.483 --> 04:04.684
I love you.
I love you, daddy.

04:06.087 --> 04:08.288
I'm gonna go do some yoga.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.956
All right, honey.

04:16.765 --> 04:20.700
So, what appearance
of geopolitical importance

04:20.702 --> 04:23.403
Does my wife have
planned for me today?

04:23.405 --> 04:25.805
None, sir. She thought
maybe some golf.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.241
You know, take it easy today.
Just relax.

04:28.243 --> 04:31.911
Yes, and then maybe we could
go to the rest home for bingo

04:31.913 --> 04:34.714
And a water aerobics class.

04:34.716 --> 04:37.183
Hmm?

04:50.165 --> 04:51.197
Oh.

04:53.435 --> 04:57.770
I would like to share
with you the truth about me.

04:57.772 --> 05:01.274
And that is that I stand
here today only because

05:01.276 --> 05:05.044
Of all those women
who have paved the way,

05:05.046 --> 05:07.947
Who've opened doors for me.

05:07.949 --> 05:11.784
And when I speak of women,
I'm not talking about

05:11.786 --> 05:14.654
Heads of state or famous
civil rights figures.

05:14.656 --> 05:17.757
<i>I'm talking about mothers.</i>

05:17.759 --> 05:20.827
I'm talking about you.

05:20.829 --> 05:23.429
<i>Long before I was first lady,</i>

05:23.431 --> 05:26.299
<i>Before I was married
to then governor graves,</i>

05:26.301 --> 05:29.068
I was the daughter
of a divorced single mom

05:29.070 --> 05:30.770
Living paycheck to paycheck.

05:30.772 --> 05:33.039
We had very little.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.808
<i>But what I did have was a mother</i>

05:35.810 --> 05:39.612
Who made sure I knew exactly
how much she loved me.

05:39.614 --> 05:44.784
Today I know your children will be
strong because of your strength.

05:44.786 --> 05:47.987
It's you who has the power

05:47.989 --> 05:50.957
To open doors for them.

05:50.959 --> 05:53.293
Thank you so much for coming.

06:29.664 --> 06:32.098
Ah, you must be hungry, huh?

06:32.100 --> 06:34.867
Thinking maybe like
a sandwich, try a salad.

06:34.869 --> 06:37.203
Think I saw some chili.
There you are.

06:37.205 --> 06:41.908
I wasn't sure you'd show. Dude,
the other night was insane.

06:41.910 --> 06:43.509
Your wife looked
a little pissed.

06:43.511 --> 06:45.511
She didn't think that
you and I were...

06:45.513 --> 06:49.649
She's the first lady, Samantha.

06:49.651 --> 06:53.152
Yeah, I guess.
You okay?

06:53.154 --> 06:57.657
Yes. I'll have a coffee and
club sandwich, thank you.

06:57.659 --> 06:59.792
Okay, so it's like that, huh?

06:59.794 --> 07:03.196
The president is feeling
especially presidential right now.

07:04.866 --> 07:06.432
Okay, whatever.

07:06.434 --> 07:08.701
It's just I guess I was
a little concerned about you

07:08.703 --> 07:12.071
With the news and all today.
What news is that?

07:12.073 --> 07:15.241
I really don't think... did you have
any split pea... I feel like I saw...

07:15.243 --> 07:18.311
The crazy dude that went
all "taxi driver" on you...

07:20.982 --> 07:22.982
He's up for release.

07:24.753 --> 07:26.386
Shit.

07:32.527 --> 07:34.460
It's a ways off, sir.

07:34.462 --> 07:36.429
Hmm.

07:40.201 --> 07:42.535
Thank you for your honesty.

07:42.537 --> 07:46.339
Unlike the ass-kissing
sycophant in my life,

07:46.341 --> 07:49.075
You can't help
but speak the truth.

07:49.077 --> 07:52.145
My assistant Judas here

07:52.147 --> 07:54.981
Will give you a private number.

07:54.983 --> 07:58.251
If there's anything you
ever need, please call me.

08:00.388 --> 08:01.687
Thanks, Prez.

08:03.358 --> 08:06.592
Home, Judas.
Get me home right now.

08:13.568 --> 08:17.203
There she is. Brilliant
as usual, Maggie.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.405
Aw, thank you, Silas.

08:19.407 --> 08:20.840
How are you?
Just right.

08:20.842 --> 08:22.141
Michael Steele.

08:22.143 --> 08:23.709
Good to see you,
Mrs. Graves.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.845
What are you doing way out here?

08:25.847 --> 08:27.980
Donating to my shelter, I hope.

08:27.982 --> 08:29.849
Not exactly.

08:29.851 --> 08:31.751
We need to talk to you, darling.

08:33.788 --> 08:36.889
But I promised Mrs. Graves
I would get you on this call.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.791
Not gonna happen, you turncoat.

08:38.793 --> 08:42.061
<i>So how was lunch?</i>
Snakes in the grass, Ramona.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.996
Fucking snakes in the grass.

08:43.998 --> 08:46.032
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about the Treadwell news,

08:46.034 --> 08:47.767
But I know
this call is important.

08:47.769 --> 08:49.268
Tell him I was held up.

08:49.270 --> 08:52.004
But he's your son.
<i>He hates me!</i>

08:56.311 --> 08:59.479
Oh, uh...

08:59.481 --> 09:01.848
Who the hell are you?

09:01.850 --> 09:04.417
I'm Isaiah miller, sir. I'm
president graves' new assistant.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.519
Just please just
go get my father.

09:06.521 --> 09:08.521
He, um...

09:08.523 --> 09:10.156
He couldn't make it.

09:10.158 --> 09:13.059
Oh, okay.
Okay.

09:13.061 --> 09:15.194
Oh, well.

09:15.196 --> 09:17.530
<i>Then I guess this is how
we're gonna do this.</i>

09:17.532 --> 09:20.166
But I need you to really listen to me,
okay. Can you do that for me, Isaac?

09:20.168 --> 09:21.501
It's Isaiah, but yeah, yeah.

09:21.503 --> 09:23.336
First, I need you
to go tell the president

09:23.338 --> 09:25.771
That I say hello and that
I wonder how he's doing.

09:25.773 --> 09:28.140
<i>And I'm really bummed
I missed him today, okay?</i>

09:28.142 --> 09:32.078
I figure he's super busy. I mean, you
know, not like in a war zone busy

09:32.080 --> 09:33.613
Where he only gets
three minutes to talk

09:33.615 --> 09:36.015
Before he has to go light
a shit barrel on fire,

09:36.017 --> 09:37.116
But whatever, it's all good.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.118
Now, if he does ask about me,

09:39.120 --> 09:41.587
I mean, if he happens to inquire
on his own, which he may not,

09:41.589 --> 09:43.222
<i>But if he does,
if he asks how I'm doing,</i>

09:43.224 --> 09:45.458
You can tell him that,
hey, I'm not dead,

09:45.460 --> 09:47.627
So high fives
all around on that.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.696
You know, Jeremy, if I could just
jump in really quick, I think...

09:50.698 --> 09:52.265
No, you cannot, Ivan, okay?

09:52.267 --> 09:54.433
Because after the whole
Jeremy's alive celebration,

09:54.435 --> 09:56.602
I need you to tell the old man
that I'm gonna be staying at home

09:56.604 --> 09:58.905
With him and mom for a little
while when I get back.

09:58.907 --> 10:02.775
<i>And if he seems foggy as to the
context of what you're saying,</i>

10:02.777 --> 10:07.713
If he just stares at you
with that blank fucking look,

10:07.715 --> 10:10.416
<i>Maybe you could remind him that
the emotion he should be feeling</i>

10:10.418 --> 10:14.887
Towards his son having to move home after
four years in the army is compassion.

10:14.889 --> 10:17.790
I'd go for happiness, but who the
fuck are we kidding here, right?

10:17.792 --> 10:20.526
Got to lead a horse to water
and just pray to Christ

10:20.528 --> 10:23.529
He doesn't try and drink
the goddamn sand.

10:23.531 --> 10:26.198
You hear me, graves?
I know you do!

10:26.200 --> 10:29.402
<i>Ah, cocksucker!</i>

10:30.905 --> 10:32.471
Dad just took off
running, didn't he?

10:32.473 --> 10:34.540
Like a cheetah.

10:37.111 --> 10:40.613
Maggie, we want you to run
for Tom Udall's senate seat.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.150
Stop it.

10:44.152 --> 10:46.118
Come on, now.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.287
Well, it's opening
up as you know.

10:48.289 --> 10:49.655
We think you can hold it.

10:49.657 --> 10:51.757
You're really
the only one who can.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.228
Are you serious?

10:56.230 --> 10:58.164
As the heart attack
I had in June.

10:58.166 --> 11:01.100
The senate?
Oh, I don't know, Silas.

11:01.102 --> 11:03.436
You know.
You've always known.

11:03.438 --> 11:06.038
Guys, you'd have to have
an exploratory committee.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.807
<i>Consider yourself explored.</i>

11:07.809 --> 11:09.542
Your primary challenger would be

11:09.544 --> 11:12.144
An anti-establishment
protest candidate.

11:12.146 --> 11:15.014
A bomb thrower just to the
right of Attila the Hun,

11:15.016 --> 11:16.449
But polling well.

11:16.451 --> 11:18.284
Well, that could get ugly.

11:18.286 --> 11:22.054
Look, we need someone
with your compassionate voice

11:22.056 --> 11:24.090
To help us re-brand
the republican party.

11:24.092 --> 11:25.725
Who would run it?

11:25.727 --> 11:26.993
I was thinking Annie Novak.

11:26.995 --> 11:29.428
She ran Susan Collins'
last campaign.

11:29.430 --> 11:31.597
I gave Annie her first job.

11:31.599 --> 11:34.700
She knows you and Richard.
She's in town.

11:34.702 --> 11:37.403
Available for breakfast
tomorrow to discuss.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.971
Well, how about that?

11:38.973 --> 11:42.208
Meet with Annie.
Talk to her.

11:42.210 --> 11:45.511
This is your time.
Now or never.

11:45.513 --> 11:49.582
I've honestly
never considered it.

11:51.986 --> 11:55.021
Mrs. Graves?
Are you okay?

11:55.023 --> 11:58.090
I was just asked
to run for the senate.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.759
That just happened.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.695
No!
Yes, just now.

12:02.697 --> 12:04.463
Oh, my god.

12:04.465 --> 12:08.367
I mean, at this point
in my life a senator?

12:08.369 --> 12:11.170
It's amazing, ma'am. Would you
like to call the president?

12:11.172 --> 12:13.172
No. Not yet.

12:13.174 --> 12:15.074
I'm gonna...

12:15.076 --> 12:18.177
I need to take some time and
own this for a couple of hours

12:18.179 --> 12:21.047
Before Richard just stomps
all over my moment.

12:21.049 --> 12:24.884
Oh, my god.
Wow, right?

12:24.886 --> 12:26.485
<i>Right.</i>

12:26.487 --> 12:30.723
Fucking wow!

12:30.725 --> 12:32.725
Oh!

12:36.531 --> 12:38.364
Wow.

12:43.705 --> 12:46.639
<i>With martin Treadwell's
furlough hearing now set,</i>

12:46.641 --> 12:49.508
Richard graves
is back in the news.

12:49.510 --> 12:52.311
Scary.
Staying on the subject,

12:52.313 --> 12:54.980
We are reopening what
we affectionately call

12:54.982 --> 12:56.982
The graves files.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.085
Affectionately, my ass.

12:59.087 --> 13:01.887
<i>As we reported earlier,
ice has issued</i>

13:01.889 --> 13:04.523
The largest number
of deportation notices

13:04.525 --> 13:06.892
It ever has at one time.

13:06.894 --> 13:09.328
<i>Widely called d-day</i>

13:09.330 --> 13:11.997
<i>For this nation's
undocumented workers,</i>

13:11.999 --> 13:14.366
<i>It will affect thousands.</i>

13:14.368 --> 13:18.738
America's arcane detention
and deportation policies

13:18.740 --> 13:21.841
<i>Can be traced back
to the restrictions</i>

13:21.843 --> 13:24.276
<i>Graves' conservative
administration</i>

13:24.278 --> 13:27.446
<i>Put into effect two decades ago.</i>

13:27.448 --> 13:30.349
I've been requesting
an interview

13:30.351 --> 13:32.885
With president graves
for more than 30 years.

13:32.887 --> 13:37.289
<i>He has yet to agree
to a single one.</i>

13:51.205 --> 13:54.073
Hi.

13:54.075 --> 13:55.975
This song was written for me.

13:55.977 --> 13:57.576
Hmm.

13:57.578 --> 14:01.313
It was for daddy's big
white house farewell bash

14:01.315 --> 14:03.816
At the end of his second term.

14:03.818 --> 14:06.018
Yeah, my mother
always loved this song.

14:06.020 --> 14:07.953
I bet.

14:09.824 --> 14:12.258
Come on. I want to
show you something.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.627
Me? Right now?
Yeah. Yeah.

14:14.629 --> 14:17.096
Oh, no, I'm actually
pretty uncomfortable...

14:17.098 --> 14:20.466
Don't be such a fucking pussy.

14:20.468 --> 14:23.302
No, no, I should
probably see what you...

14:27.542 --> 14:30.409
Wow.

14:33.114 --> 14:35.247
I know.
It freaks me out.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.083
<i>My childhood is a wax museum.</i>

14:44.025 --> 14:47.159
You're so sweet, Isaiah.

14:47.161 --> 14:49.862
I don't know.

14:49.864 --> 14:51.931
Something about you.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.967
You understand all of this

14:54.969 --> 14:58.604
On a meta level.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.740
You really love us,

15:01.742 --> 15:03.342
Don't you?

15:03.344 --> 15:05.978
It's deep with you.

15:05.980 --> 15:10.349
Well, who wouldn't want
to be a part of all this?

15:12.286 --> 15:13.586
What are you doing?

15:13.588 --> 15:16.355
I need this, okay?

15:16.357 --> 15:19.491
This isn't about you.
I'm very distraught.

15:19.493 --> 15:21.727
This is how I process pain.

15:23.164 --> 15:25.264
Hold this.
What?

15:26.934 --> 15:29.735
Oh!
Oh, my god!

15:31.806 --> 15:33.706
Holy shit.

15:33.708 --> 15:36.108
Where the hell have you been?

15:36.110 --> 15:37.810
Uh, I was, um...

15:37.812 --> 15:39.812
It doesn't matter.
Here, take these.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.413
They're Jeremy's.
Let's go.

15:41.415 --> 15:43.315
Go?
On a mission.

15:47.722 --> 15:51.490
So we're just crashing this
random family's QuinceaÃ±era?

15:51.492 --> 15:54.460
Don't get your panties
all in a twist.

15:54.462 --> 15:57.897
Gerardo's been my gardener
for 30 years.

15:59.300 --> 16:02.368
Today I am so proud.

16:02.370 --> 16:05.971
<i>When I came first here
for a better life,</i>

16:05.973 --> 16:10.109
I left her mother Anna
in El Salvador.

16:10.111 --> 16:11.543
Mmm.

16:11.545 --> 16:13.445
My Anna would be proud

16:13.447 --> 16:16.248
Of what became
of her little Julianita.

16:16.250 --> 16:18.217
<i>Te amo.</i>

16:20.288 --> 16:22.388
Bravo. Bravo.

16:31.465 --> 16:33.332
Call this woman.

16:33.334 --> 16:35.834
Tell her I accept her interview.

16:35.836 --> 16:37.870
Tomorrow,
one-on-one exclusive.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.438
Shouldn't your pr team
handle it?

16:39.440 --> 16:41.974
No, Benedict Arnold.
This is between us.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.478
Yeah, yeah, it's hysterical.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.347
I didn't have time
to change, okay?

16:49.684 --> 16:52.785
Hey, sir, do you mind
if I ask you a question?

16:52.787 --> 16:55.187
You know, do you ever get
a chance to go on pause

16:55.189 --> 16:58.724
<i>And, you know, just chill out, stop
being the president for a while?</i>

16:58.726 --> 17:01.493
No, it's more of a...

17:01.495 --> 17:03.062
More constant.

17:03.064 --> 17:06.498
Yeah, that kind of like
sticks with you forever, huh?

17:06.500 --> 17:09.034
It's like some psycho
one-night stand

17:09.036 --> 17:12.271
Who stalks you
and ruins your life.

17:12.272 --> 17:15.207
Let me ask you guys something.

17:15.209 --> 17:19.712
Now, show of hands,
how many of your parents

17:19.714 --> 17:21.747
Came here illegally?

17:24.151 --> 17:26.551
All of you?
Yeah.

17:26.554 --> 17:28.654
I mean, don't look so surprised.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.689
What, were you expecting
us to be all,

17:30.691 --> 17:32.758
<i>"si, seÃ±or, mi presidente.</i>

17:32.760 --> 17:35.461
I cut your grass,
<i>mi jefe."</i>

17:36.864 --> 17:39.331
Do the honors?
Oh, sure.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.166
It'll be a pleasure.

17:41.168 --> 17:42.601
Bottoms up.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.708
Oh, you got the worm.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.611
Oh, thank you.
<i>Gracias.</i>

18:05.459 --> 18:07.860
Oh, my god, that's so much.

18:09.563 --> 18:11.363
I set the interview
for tomorrow morning,

18:11.365 --> 18:13.132
Which wouldn't be so terrifying

18:13.134 --> 18:15.200
If you weren't on the precipice
of alcohol poisoning.

18:15.202 --> 18:17.236
Your jet is ready,
so we should really...

18:17.238 --> 18:18.771
Ow.

18:18.773 --> 18:22.775
You know, you've got
little, tiny baby fingers.

18:22.777 --> 18:24.910
Yes, sir, I'm painfully aware.

18:24.912 --> 18:28.280
Mr. President, I am so
honored that you came.

18:28.282 --> 18:32.751
My whole family is. No, no, it's
me who's honored to be here.

18:32.753 --> 18:34.953
Thank you for everything.

18:34.955 --> 18:36.188
<i>Bueno.</i>

18:42.997 --> 18:46.098
Until death, kid, it's all life.

18:48.936 --> 18:50.369
Shit.

19:03.984 --> 19:05.617
Congratulations.

19:50.998 --> 19:53.432
I'm sorry I'm late, Annie.

19:53.434 --> 19:54.933
First lady, what a pleasure.

19:54.935 --> 19:58.303
Oh, I am so glad it's you.

19:58.305 --> 20:01.840
Bullshit. I was available,
which I'm good with

20:01.842 --> 20:03.876
Because I've seen you
behind the scenes.

20:03.878 --> 20:05.744
You're smart, you're decisive,

20:05.746 --> 20:07.379
And has anyone in history

20:07.381 --> 20:09.515
Ever looked better in a
black suit and red pumps?

20:09.517 --> 20:10.849
I started that.

20:10.851 --> 20:13.085
You started everything.

20:14.321 --> 20:15.587
It's good to see you, too.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.955
This is gonna be fun.

20:16.957 --> 20:19.858
I haven't said yes yet.
You will.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.827
The primary opponent is tough.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.496
Not tough, mean.
I live with mean.

20:24.498 --> 20:26.465
Thomas J. Nash.
He's one of those

20:26.467 --> 20:29.902
"can't get pregnant when raped"
guys who's hijacked the party.

20:29.904 --> 20:32.037
He's hit a nerve. He's
charming, he's popular.

20:32.039 --> 20:34.039
But you, you're more popular.

20:34.041 --> 20:36.875
Nash doesn't scare me.
I know that.

20:36.877 --> 20:38.844
Everybody knows that.

20:42.316 --> 20:44.583
<i>Leave a message,
I'll get back to you.</i>

20:44.585 --> 20:46.718
Hey, it's me again,
Mrs. Graves.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.087
I'm sorry, but it's really very

20:49.089 --> 20:50.956
Sort of extremely vital
we speak.

20:50.958 --> 20:54.560
It's just that, well,
the sky is about to fall.

20:54.562 --> 20:57.396
Then why is she changing her fucking
mind again? It's making me crazy.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.467
Ms. Wolf.
Mr. President?

21:02.469 --> 21:06.305
It's a pleasure finally meeting
you after all these years.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.240
Me, too.
It's an honor.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.243
Listen, I'm almost done here.

21:11.245 --> 21:15.013
Would you like
to wait a minute or...

21:15.015 --> 21:17.115
Is something the matter?

21:17.117 --> 21:21.253
Well, according to you,
I'm what's the matter.

21:21.255 --> 21:23.121
I'd like you to please
stop approaching me.

21:23.123 --> 21:26.558
You, with your liberal
agenda, have been tearing me

21:26.560 --> 21:29.494
And my presidency
a new one for years,

21:29.496 --> 21:31.763
Turning me into patient zero

21:31.765 --> 21:34.533
For all of Americaâs problems.

21:34.535 --> 21:38.003
You need to just
back the fuck off.

21:38.005 --> 21:41.573
And you know what?
On this immigration thing,

21:41.575 --> 21:43.208
You were absolutely...

21:46.714 --> 21:48.814
I need security.

21:53.988 --> 21:57.089
Okay, here's the truth,
Annie, about all of this.

21:57.091 --> 22:00.058
I'm scared.
I'm scared shitless.

22:00.060 --> 22:04.263
I've spent so long
standing behind my husband,

22:04.265 --> 22:07.466
And now I...

22:07.468 --> 22:10.469
I feel like I'm trapped

22:10.471 --> 22:13.205
Inside this thing
we've created, this name.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.841
And honestly, I'm not sure

22:15.843 --> 22:18.944
I could survive
outside of it alone.

22:18.946 --> 22:21.446
Well, that sounds like a prison.

22:23.317 --> 22:25.584
Oh, excuse me.

22:28.489 --> 22:31.123
Yes, Isaiah? <i>Mrs. Graves!
Oh, my god!</i>

22:31.125 --> 22:32.924
<i>President graves had
a meeting with Laura wolf</i>

22:32.926 --> 22:35.060
<i>And she says he tried
to kill her.</i>

22:37.364 --> 22:38.664
Ma'am?

22:38.666 --> 22:40.732
The president killed her?

22:40.734 --> 22:43.335
No, no, no, he tried
according to ms. Wolf.

22:43.337 --> 22:46.038
And she wants to sue.

22:46.040 --> 22:48.740
Ma'am? I'm sorry,
I have to leave.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.475
But there's so much to discuss.

22:50.477 --> 22:52.544
Something's happened with Richard.
What?

22:52.546 --> 22:55.714
I have to fly home. But give
me one more hour, tops.

22:55.716 --> 22:59.451
This is my life. It won't
be if you run for senate.

22:59.453 --> 23:01.286
It can't be.

23:01.288 --> 23:03.188
We'll talk.

23:03.190 --> 23:05.290
Bye.

23:05.292 --> 23:07.726
Yeah.

23:07.728 --> 23:09.861
The man put his hands on me.

23:09.863 --> 23:11.630
I have to sue, you know this.

23:11.632 --> 23:14.866
I... I think you misunderstood
the president.

23:14.868 --> 23:16.802
Really?
I misunderstood?

23:16.804 --> 23:18.470
"you've got to be
kitten me."

23:18.472 --> 23:20.305
I didn't have time to change.

23:20.307 --> 23:24.576
Look, ms. Wolf, whether you
agree with his politics or not,

23:24.578 --> 23:27.913
<i>President graves has meant
so much to so many people.</i>

23:27.915 --> 23:29.815
Your judgment
of his administration

23:29.817 --> 23:34.019
Doesn't have anything to do with
what is human about a president.

23:34.021 --> 23:37.389
So please, for me and anyone

23:37.391 --> 23:40.058
Who's ever admired
Richard graves,

23:40.060 --> 23:43.061
Go easy on him.

23:45.733 --> 23:48.867
Why should she?
She was right.

23:48.869 --> 23:52.304
She... no. Why are you...
I was just helping.

23:52.306 --> 23:53.939
<i>That's what I was
trying to tell her.</i>

23:53.941 --> 23:56.942
On certain issues, Isaiah,

23:56.944 --> 23:59.411
I am patient zero.

23:59.413 --> 24:02.247
What you just said,
Mr. President,

24:02.249 --> 24:05.384
Would you be willing
to repeat on camera?

24:05.386 --> 24:07.352
What? No.

24:07.354 --> 24:08.687
Yes.

24:15.662 --> 24:17.629
First of all, president graves,

24:17.631 --> 24:20.031
Thank you for this interview.

24:20.033 --> 24:22.701
Laura, it's a pleasure
to be here.

24:22.703 --> 24:25.804
Ma'am, come quick.
Yeah?

24:25.806 --> 24:27.706
You're not gonna believe this.

24:27.708 --> 24:31.176
On your show recently,
you talked about the border

24:31.178 --> 24:33.612
And my administration's
policies,

24:33.614 --> 24:35.847
The ripple effect leading up

24:35.849 --> 24:39.351
To these mass
deportation notices.

24:39.353 --> 24:43.054
Well, what I did
and what others have done,

24:43.056 --> 24:47.325
Is... well, it's...

24:47.327 --> 24:50.429
It's a damn shame.
Sir?

24:50.431 --> 24:53.598
There's a quote I love
from George Washington.

24:53.600 --> 24:57.202
He said, "I had always hoped

24:57.204 --> 25:00.138
That this land might become

25:00.140 --> 25:02.674
A safe and agreeable asylum

25:02.676 --> 25:06.344
To the virtuous and persecuted
part of mankind

25:06.346 --> 25:09.181
<i>To whatever nation
they might belong."</i>

25:09.183 --> 25:13.385
<i>This was the dream
of our very first president.</i>

25:13.387 --> 25:15.854
So I asked myself

25:15.856 --> 25:18.423
How would Washington feel

25:18.425 --> 25:22.093
<i>If he could see what
we've done to his dream?</i>

25:22.095 --> 25:24.863
He'd blow his fucking
brains out.

25:24.865 --> 25:27.332
What?

25:27.334 --> 25:29.100
Richard.

25:29.102 --> 25:31.603
Sir, reminder, we're on live.

25:31.605 --> 25:34.906
How many more people
need to live in fear

25:34.908 --> 25:37.242
<i>In the shadows of America</i>

25:37.244 --> 25:41.446
<i>While they labor in the fields
of our largest corporations,</i>

25:41.448 --> 25:44.115
<i>Cultivate, pick, cook our food,</i>

25:44.117 --> 25:46.852
Fix our cars, clean our homes,

25:46.854 --> 25:49.454
Clean our offices, our toilets?

25:49.456 --> 25:52.991
I promise you, Laura, the
evidence of your last shit

25:52.993 --> 25:57.329
Was bleached away clean
by a tiny Hispanic woman

25:57.331 --> 26:00.065
Whose name you didn't
have the decency

26:00.067 --> 26:02.000
To ask for or care about.

26:02.002 --> 26:04.169
Fuck, yeah.

26:04.171 --> 26:06.505
<i>And for what?
It's a moral shit show</i>

26:06.507 --> 26:09.207
That's playing out
every day as we hide

26:09.209 --> 26:12.410
Mexican and south American
men, women, and children

26:12.412 --> 26:15.547
<i>In the attics of our
collective lives.</i>

26:15.549 --> 26:18.083
As far as I'm concerned,

26:18.085 --> 26:22.087
To make amends
for my past transgressions,

26:22.089 --> 26:24.923
Any of these
undocumented workers

26:24.925 --> 26:28.393
That received their
deportation notices,

26:28.395 --> 26:31.963
If they want to come out
to my compound in Santa Fe,

26:31.965 --> 26:35.667
You're more than welcome.

26:35.669 --> 26:40.639
And I dare immigration
to take you off my land.

26:40.641 --> 26:42.307
They don't have the balls.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.409
What the hell is he doing?

26:44.411 --> 26:47.145
Thank you, president graves.
God bless you, Laura.

26:47.147 --> 26:50.715
And god bless
the united states of America.

26:52.085 --> 26:56.555
I'm so fired.
I'm so fired.

27:10.470 --> 27:13.939
Okay, that interview,
everybody's seen it by now.

27:13.941 --> 27:17.208
I... I...
That's total insanity.

27:17.210 --> 27:20.011
You have never been this...

27:20.013 --> 27:22.213
Undisciplined, unhinged.

27:22.215 --> 27:24.149
My god, new york and now...

27:24.151 --> 27:26.851
I mean, Richard,
how worried should I be?

27:26.853 --> 27:29.054
'cause I'm starting
to really freak out here.

27:29.056 --> 27:32.357
I'm sorry, Maggie, but...

27:33.827 --> 27:35.894
I don't know.
I mean...

27:37.531 --> 27:41.166
I'm tired of being a shadow.

27:41.168 --> 27:45.804
You know, I almost
died once before.

27:47.474 --> 27:49.608
And...

27:49.610 --> 27:51.776
I need to start living.

27:53.180 --> 27:54.946
Yours hasn't been a life?

27:54.948 --> 27:57.248
You haven't been living?

27:57.250 --> 28:00.585
No, no, no, not us.
I mean me.

28:00.587 --> 28:04.623
I need to start living in an...

28:04.625 --> 28:06.725
Authentic way.

28:08.095 --> 28:10.895
Do you understand what I mean?

28:12.366 --> 28:15.200
Maggie, please.
Tell me you understand.

28:15.202 --> 28:18.203
Because I just don't...
It's okay. It's okay.

28:18.205 --> 28:21.640
You're gonna be okay.

28:21.642 --> 28:23.174
It's okay.

28:23.176 --> 28:24.843
It's just me.

28:24.845 --> 28:26.945
It's just us.

28:26.947 --> 28:29.247
I love you, Maggie.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.616
I love you, Richard.

28:31.618 --> 28:33.785
It's okay.

28:44.931 --> 28:47.165
Do you hear something?

29:29.242 --> 29:31.443
Hey, Mr. Presidente!

29:31.445 --> 29:33.712
It's us, remember?
It's us, remember?

29:33.714 --> 29:35.980
<i>Mr. Presidente!
Mr. Presidente!</i>

29:35.982 --> 29:38.583
What have you done?

29:43.023 --> 29:46.224
Yeah. Yeah.
