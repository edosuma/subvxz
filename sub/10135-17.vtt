07:47.217 --> 07:48.760
But I have a system

07:47.217 --> 07:48.760
that is going to make

07:48.802 --> 07:50.470
learning to read even more fun.

why it says, "Michelle?"

13:21.800 --> 13:23.886

13:25.513 --> 13:26.889

Now for the I.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.693

13:36.815 --> 13:38.693
what sound does that makes?

13:38.735 --> 13:40.153
Piece of cake.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.781
I, like eye.

13:42.821 --> 13:44.324
Well, not exactly.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.992
That eye starts with an E.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.994
It sounds like an I,

13:46.033 --> 13:47.994
but it isn't.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.121
But that I in your name,

13:48.035 --> 13:50.121
doesn't sound like the I

13:50.163 --> 13:51.289
that starts with the E.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.167
It sounds like I as in, it.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.002
If you say so.

13:57.671 --> 14:00.923
You see, Michelle, vowels have

13:57.671 --> 14:00.923
long sounds and short sounds.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.593
And if the vowel is long,

14:00.965 --> 14:03.593
it says its own name.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.428
A, E, I, O, U.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.971
If the vowel is short

14:07.013 --> 14:08.306
it has a different sound.

14:08.348 --> 14:12.143
Aah, eh, ih,

14:08.348 --> 14:12.143
ah and uh.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.353
Huh?

14:14.729 --> 14:17.357
Right! Just like, huh.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.652
However, a short vowel

14:17.398 --> 14:20.652
can be changed into a long vowel

14:20.694 --> 14:22.696
if the word has a silent E

14:22.737 --> 14:24.864
like the word "date."

14:24.905 --> 14:28.201
If you take off that E,

14:24.905 --> 14:28.201
the word becomes "dat."

14:28.242 --> 14:29.452
But that's a really bad example

14:29.494 --> 14:32.079
because dat

14:29.494 --> 14:32.079

about being dumb

18:03.958 --> 18:06.753
and rephrase that.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.671
Now see, when

18:06.794 --> 18:08.671
I was in first grade

18:08.713 --> 18:10.339
uh, there-there were

18:08.713 --> 18:10.339
two kinda reading groups.

18:10.381 --> 18:11.966
There were the bluebirds

18:10.381 --> 18:11.966
and the robins.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.718
And I was a robin

18:12.008 --> 18:13.718
and everyone knew

18:13.760 --> 18:15.302
the robins were kinda

18:13.760 --> 18:15.302
slow readers.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.764
So I thought that meant

18:15.344 --> 18:17.764
that I was dumb.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.558
So instead of, uh, spending

18:17.805 --> 18:20.558
my time trying to learn to read

18:20.600 --> 18:22.810
I-I spent all my time

18:28.357 --> 18:30.985
I thought I was dumb,

18:28.357 --> 18:30.985
so I gave up trying.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.653
I mean, I got bad grades

18:31.027 --> 18:32.653
for a long time

18:32.695 --> 18:34.655

18:32.695 --> 18:34.655
that I'm a smart guy.

22:07.367 --> 22:08.828
Yeah.

22:09.787 --> 22:12.623
I guess I was mad at myself.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.875
I just wanted to be the best.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.794
You<i> are.</i>

22:16.836 --> 22:18.462
You're the best speller

22:16.836 --> 22:18.462
in your class.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.089
You might even be

22:18.504 --> 22:20.089
the best speller in this house.

22:20.131 --> 22:21.299
- Dad?

22:20.131 --> 22:21.299
- Okay.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.802
You are the best speller

22:21.340 --> 22:24.802
in this house.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.680
Sweetheart, you have to be proud

22:24.844 --> 22:27.680
of your accomplishments.

22:27.721 --> 22:30.057
But no matter

22:27.721 --> 22:30.057
how good you are at something

22:30.099 --> 22:32.143
there'll always maybe

22:30.099 --> 22:32.143
a Davey Chu out there

22:32.185 --> 22:35.271
who might be just a little bit

22:32.185 --> 22:35.271
better then you are.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.439
It's just as important

22:35.313 --> 22:37.439
to be a good loser

22:37.481 --> 22:38.607
as it is to be

22:37.481 --> 22:38.607
a good winner, honey

22:40.442 --> 22:43.487
You're right.

22:40.442 --> 22:43.487
I'm sorry, dad.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.323
I can't wait till I lose again

22:43.529 --> 22:45.323
so I can show you

22:45.363 --> 22:47.616
how good I am at it.

22:47.658 --> 22:50.452
Now you're talking like

22:47.658 --> 22:50.452
a winner. Come here.
