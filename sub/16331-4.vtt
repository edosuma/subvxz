WEBVTT

00:03.479 --> 00:05.146
Shelby had totally lost it.

00:05.148 --> 00:06.981
I saw you
with her, Matt.

00:06.983 --> 00:08.215
Who was she?

00:08.217 --> 00:09.717
MATT:
<i> So many deaths</i>

00:09.719 --> 00:10.918
<i> and disappearances</i>

00:10.920 --> 00:12.086
<i> around the same time of year,</i>

00:12.088 --> 00:13.154
going back decades.

00:17.493 --> 00:19.427
(woman laughing)

00:19.429 --> 00:21.195
Show yourself to me!

00:21.197 --> 00:23.330
THOMASIN:
<i> This is our land.</i>

00:23.332 --> 00:27.068
I will soak this earth
with our blood

00:27.070 --> 00:31.806
and tether us to these grounds
forever!

00:37.747 --> 00:40.381
Shelby had totally lost it.

00:40.383 --> 00:43.084
I mean, suddenly, Lee and I

00:43.086 --> 00:45.586
were conspiring
against her for some reason.

00:45.588 --> 00:47.388
I saw you
with her, Matt,

00:47.390 --> 00:48.956
up against
a goddamn tree.

00:48.958 --> 00:49.957
Her turning Lee in

00:49.959 --> 00:52.593
wasn't the hardest part for me.

00:52.595 --> 00:55.129
It was that I couldn't
remember anything

00:55.131 --> 00:57.198
about being out in those woods.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.065
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:58.067 --> 01:00.034
(chuckles)
Y-You...

01:00.036 --> 01:01.068
Do you not believe me?

01:01.070 --> 01:02.236
Believe you?! Why?!

01:02.238 --> 01:04.305
Why should I believe you
when you've been

01:04.307 --> 01:05.606
lying to me?

01:05.608 --> 01:07.708
You and Lee went behind my back.

01:07.710 --> 01:09.743
We just tried to make a deal
to get Flora back.

01:09.745 --> 01:11.378
That's it!
I'm sorry,

01:11.380 --> 01:12.580
Shelby, that we
didn't tell you,

01:12.582 --> 01:13.614
but you know what?

01:13.616 --> 01:14.615
I knew you wouldn't go for it!

01:14.617 --> 01:15.983
I... am your wife.

01:15.985 --> 01:17.284
How am I supposed to trust

01:17.286 --> 01:18.686
anything you say now?!

01:19.755 --> 01:21.589
My, God, Matt, who is she?

01:21.591 --> 01:23.657
Who?
Who is who, Shelby?

01:23.659 --> 01:24.592
Who was she, goddamn it?!

01:24.594 --> 01:26.060
Stop saying this to me.
Who was she?

01:26.062 --> 01:27.394
Stop saying these things to me!

01:31.467 --> 01:33.400
(strained):
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:33.402 --> 01:35.002
I don't remember, okay?!

01:35.004 --> 01:36.437
I don't remember!

01:36.439 --> 01:38.973
It's like a part of my brain
was carved out.

01:38.975 --> 01:41.942
And-and-and I-I
just don't remember!

01:41.944 --> 01:45.846
(crying):
Help me, Shelby, 'cause
I'm telling you the truth!

01:45.848 --> 01:47.982
(sobs)

01:47.984 --> 01:50.117
I don't remember!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:50.119 --> 01:51.652
I don't remember.
Look at me.

01:51.654 --> 01:53.621
Look at me,
look at me, look at me.

01:53.623 --> 01:54.622
I don't remember, Shel.

01:54.624 --> 01:55.956
I believe.

01:55.958 --> 01:56.924
I believe you.

01:56.926 --> 01:59.026
(crying):
I'm sorry.

01:59.028 --> 02:01.629
SHELBY:
<i> I know what I saw.</i>

02:01.631 --> 02:04.131
<i> It was real.</i>

02:04.133 --> 02:07.768
But I could see in his eyes
that...

02:07.770 --> 02:10.571
he wasn't culpable.

02:33.062 --> 02:34.528
(screams)

02:35.698 --> 02:38.465
(screaming)

02:40.136 --> 02:41.135
(screams)

02:41.137 --> 02:43.070
Matt! Matt!

02:45.074 --> 02:46.307
(screams)

02:53.182 --> 02:54.248
(inhuman howling)

02:54.250 --> 02:56.283
(grunts)

02:59.188 --> 03:01.055
(inhuman howling)

03:04.727 --> 03:07.127
(Shelby screams)

03:09.165 --> 03:10.731
(inhuman howling)

03:10.733 --> 03:12.733
(Shelby shouts)

03:20.776 --> 03:22.843
(inhuman howling)

03:26.082 --> 03:27.348
Croatoan!

03:35.024 --> 03:36.457
Hey.

03:38.361 --> 03:39.927
He'll be back.

03:50.940 --> 03:53.207
SHELBY:
<i> It was the man from the video.</i>

03:53.209 --> 03:56.076
I had thought back then
that he was insane.

03:56.078 --> 04:00.981
Meeting him did nothing
to dispel that impression.

04:00.983 --> 04:03.584
"Croatoan."

04:03.586 --> 04:05.953
That's the third time
I've heard that word.

04:09.091 --> 04:10.724
I-I don't understand.

04:13.763 --> 04:15.229
Croatoan

04:15.231 --> 04:19.333
was a message left at
Roanoke for the others

04:19.335 --> 04:21.935
so they could find
the lost colony.

04:21.937 --> 04:25.172
It is actually a
word of dark power

04:25.174 --> 04:27.007
and blood magic.

04:31.080 --> 04:32.913
You're the professor
on the tape.

04:32.915 --> 04:34.014
Used to live in this house.

04:34.016 --> 04:36.317
Well, technically,
I only stayed here

04:36.319 --> 04:38.452
for six months, but I've been
the owner for years.

04:38.454 --> 04:39.987
No one who knew
the history

04:39.989 --> 04:41.021
of this place
would touch it.

04:41.023 --> 04:42.589
You can search the title,

04:42.591 --> 04:44.024
and within months
of taking possession,

04:44.026 --> 04:45.659
everyone who ever
owned it was either

04:45.661 --> 04:48.028
dead or had gone missing.

04:48.030 --> 04:50.030
I became its guardian.

04:50.032 --> 04:52.299
I couldn't live in the
house, but I kept it

04:52.301 --> 04:54.134
so others wouldn't make
the same mistake,

04:54.136 --> 04:55.602
and then a slight
reversal of fortune

04:55.604 --> 04:56.970
made me a little
short when

04:56.972 --> 04:58.672
property tax time
came around

04:58.674 --> 05:00.874
and you two were
unlucky enough to buy it

05:00.876 --> 05:02.209
at auction.

05:09.151 --> 05:11.719
I'm important to you

05:11.721 --> 05:13.153
for your survival.

05:13.155 --> 05:14.555
You want me here.

05:15.624 --> 05:17.057
No, actually,

05:17.059 --> 05:18.726
I want you out of my house.

05:18.728 --> 05:21.061
No. I saved your asses!

05:21.063 --> 05:22.229
I'm trying
to help you.

05:22.231 --> 05:23.831
I know things!
Mr. Piggy!

05:23.833 --> 05:25.699
That wasn't the first time

05:25.701 --> 05:28.669
he showed up and it's not gonna
be the last time, either.

05:28.671 --> 05:30.170
SHELBY:
<i> Elias was right.</i>

05:30.172 --> 05:32.306
<i> I'd seen the pig man before</i>

05:32.308 --> 05:34.074
<i> when I was lost in the woods.</i>

05:34.076 --> 05:36.143
<i> There was a ritual,</i>

05:36.145 --> 05:38.145
<i> human sacrifice,</i>

05:38.147 --> 05:39.747
<i> and he was being burned alive.</i>

05:39.749 --> 05:41.982
What else do you know?

05:41.984 --> 05:44.585
I want to show you something.

05:55.030 --> 05:56.997
Ah, careful.

05:56.999 --> 05:58.766
You've got your hands
on decades of my life.

05:58.768 --> 06:00.734
I mean, I'm not saying
I've got it cracked completely,

06:00.736 --> 06:02.936
but this is the entire list
of the paranormal activity

06:02.938 --> 06:04.037
within the house

06:04.039 --> 06:05.272
and the surrounding environment.

06:05.274 --> 06:08.509
Trust me, there will be
a book... one day.

06:12.782 --> 06:14.381
MATT:
1973, the Chen family.

06:14.383 --> 06:16.750
Yes. They, uh, immigrated

06:16.752 --> 06:18.585
from Taiwan
with the thought

06:18.587 --> 06:20.888
of living the
American Dream, you know?

06:20.890 --> 06:21.922
Full immersion.

06:21.924 --> 06:24.591
They adopted American names.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.393
They spoke only English
in the house.

06:26.395 --> 06:28.562
¶ I can feel your heartbeat ¶

06:28.564 --> 06:30.764
¶ And you didn't even
say a word ¶

06:30.766 --> 06:33.801
¶ I can feel your heartbeat ¶

06:33.803 --> 06:36.103
¶ But you didn't even
say a word ¶

06:36.105 --> 06:39.039
¶ Oh, I know, pretty woman
that your love can be heard ¶

06:39.041 --> 06:41.208
¶ Ah, ah, ah ¶

06:41.210 --> 06:42.609
¶ We paint the night... ¶

06:42.611 --> 06:45.112
I don't understand
those pants.

06:47.149 --> 06:49.783
English, Daisy.

06:49.785 --> 06:52.319
I hope Mama is
not divorced.

06:52.321 --> 06:54.388
Americans like
to get divorced.

06:54.390 --> 06:56.089
Her husband is dead.

06:56.091 --> 06:57.458
Better.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.826
(loud thud)

07:02.731 --> 07:05.132
Is Amy upstairs?

07:10.005 --> 07:12.172
(loud, heavy thuds)

07:20.916 --> 07:23.150
(electricity crackles, fizzles)

07:25.588 --> 07:27.254
Amy!

07:27.256 --> 07:28.522
Wait!

07:30.426 --> 07:31.692
Amy, wait!
Amy!

07:32.695 --> 07:34.194
(pigs howling)

07:36.165 --> 07:37.164
(screams)

07:37.166 --> 07:39.032
They were immigrants

07:39.034 --> 07:42.603
and nobody told them
the history of the house.

07:42.605 --> 07:43.837
They didn't have a clue
what hit them.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.215
(inhuman howling)

07:55.217 --> 07:56.383
(screams)

07:59.288 --> 08:01.388
(crying)

08:04.693 --> 08:06.493
Oh, honey.

08:06.495 --> 08:08.595
(crying)

08:11.500 --> 08:13.967
So, the Chens fought back
the only way they knew how.

08:13.969 --> 08:15.402
They prayed to
their ancestors

08:15.404 --> 08:16.703
and they made offerings

08:16.705 --> 08:18.639
to protect them from evil.

08:18.641 --> 08:20.974
<i> But their ancestors</i>
<i> were no match</i>

08:20.976 --> 08:22.709
<i> for what was already here.</i>

08:38.928 --> 08:40.193
(screams)

08:40.195 --> 08:42.563
(screaming)

08:42.565 --> 08:46.033
I guess they never had a chance.

08:46.035 --> 08:48.001
But you do.

08:50.372 --> 08:52.172
Oh, my God.

08:53.175 --> 08:55.709
These go back to the 1700s.

08:55.711 --> 08:57.277
ELIAS:
Yes. The house
was completed

08:57.279 --> 08:59.580
in 1792 by Edward Felippe Mott,

08:59.582 --> 09:01.281
who was the first
who disappeared.

09:01.283 --> 09:03.350
Uh...

09:05.087 --> 09:07.054
Hey.
Yeah.

09:07.056 --> 09:09.256
You've seen the sisters before,
haven't you?

09:09.258 --> 09:11.959
They were the ones in my dream.

09:11.961 --> 09:14.595
Or what I thought was my dream.

09:14.597 --> 09:17.264
At that point,
I didn't know what to believe.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.699
<i> Or what his angle was.</i>

09:18.701 --> 09:20.567
The Jane sisters
were psychopaths

09:20.569 --> 09:23.103
who tortured and murdered
their patients, but...

09:23.105 --> 09:25.806
what is even
more frightening is

09:25.808 --> 09:28.875
in this house, even
those killers were terrified.

09:28.877 --> 09:32.145
(wind howling outside)

09:42.257 --> 09:43.824
(shouts)
(sobs)

09:43.826 --> 09:45.492
So your research told you
they were killed

09:45.494 --> 09:47.227
by the spirits here.
No.

09:47.229 --> 09:48.996
They told me themselves.

09:48.998 --> 09:50.063
What?

09:50.065 --> 09:52.065
(chuckles)

09:52.067 --> 09:54.234
ELIAS:
<i> I was hiding in the woods</i>

09:54.236 --> 09:57.571
<i> when they found me. </i>
(twig snaps)

09:57.573 --> 09:59.673
<i> I had no choice</i>
<i> but to hear their story.</i>

09:59.675 --> 10:03.844
We thought we were safe.
<i> They planted it</i>
<i> so deep in my head,</i>

10:03.846 --> 10:06.279
<i> that I can't forget</i>
<i> the horror of their deaths</i>

10:06.281 --> 10:07.781
<i> at the hands of the Butcher.</i>

10:07.783 --> 10:09.282
Thou hast chosen to remain

10:09.284 --> 10:10.584
on these hallowed grounds

10:10.586 --> 10:13.020
despite our warnings.

10:13.022 --> 10:16.089
For these sins, thy blood
shall sanctify the land,

10:16.091 --> 10:19.026
thy body to enrich the soil

10:19.028 --> 10:22.029
and thy soul to serve me

10:22.031 --> 10:23.930
for eternity and a day.

10:23.932 --> 10:25.966
(heavy breathing)

10:25.968 --> 10:27.000
Aah!

10:27.002 --> 10:29.002
(sisters whimpering)

10:29.004 --> 10:30.437
Pull!

10:30.439 --> 10:31.738
(screaming):
No!

10:33.609 --> 10:34.775
Pull!

10:34.777 --> 10:36.643
(bones cracking)

10:36.645 --> 10:37.978
Pull!

10:37.980 --> 10:41.014
(screaming)

10:41.016 --> 10:42.049
Pull!

10:42.051 --> 10:43.283
(ripping)

10:44.887 --> 10:46.053
(screams)

10:46.055 --> 10:47.187
(sobbing)

10:49.391 --> 10:51.992
(crying)

10:51.994 --> 10:54.895
Evil whore...

10:54.897 --> 10:59.533
thou shall not want
for lack of company.

10:59.535 --> 11:00.467
(whimpering)

11:04.139 --> 11:05.672
And then, there
were the others.

11:05.674 --> 11:07.774
Here, look.

11:08.844 --> 11:11.144
October 3, 1952.

11:11.146 --> 11:12.546
Three hunters
staying in the house.

11:12.548 --> 11:14.548
Something made them turn
their rifles on each other

11:14.550 --> 11:15.882
and blow their heads off.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.084
Uh...

11:17.086 --> 11:19.152
October 19, 1973.

11:19.154 --> 11:21.321
The Chens are
discovered missing.

11:21.323 --> 11:23.757
Uh... Oh!
October 29,

11:23.759 --> 11:25.559
1989.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.994
The sisters are found
to have abandoned the house.

11:27.996 --> 11:30.997
(exhales) Different
years, but every death,

11:30.999 --> 11:32.899
every missing person,

11:32.901 --> 11:34.868
takes place during the same

11:34.870 --> 11:36.169
lunar cycle in October.

11:36.171 --> 11:37.838
The Native Americans
called it

11:37.840 --> 11:39.873
the Dying Grass Moon.
It's six days,

11:39.875 --> 11:42.075
six blood-drenched days.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.678
From the first quarter moon,
to the blood moon.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.580
Now, the spirits can
haunt you at any time.

11:46.582 --> 11:49.349
They can show themselves or not,
but during this period...

11:49.351 --> 11:52.018
this is when they can kill.

11:52.020 --> 11:54.721
So. Now you
understand the danger.

11:54.723 --> 11:57.090
The first quarter
moon rises tonight.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.458
We have to leave, right now.

11:58.460 --> 12:01.027
MATT:<i> It was hard</i>
<i> to argue with the man.</i>

12:01.029 --> 12:03.196
So many deaths,
and-and disappearances

12:03.198 --> 12:05.065
around the same time of year?

12:05.067 --> 12:06.967
Going back decades?

12:06.969 --> 12:09.636
Here was a guy who admitted
that he'd lost the property

12:09.638 --> 12:11.772
because he couldn't
pay a tax bill.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.473
<i> Maybe he just wanted</i>
<i> the house back.</i>

12:13.475 --> 12:15.375
MATT: We're not leaving
without my niece.

12:15.377 --> 12:17.878
Heard about that on the news.
I'm so sorry, but if the Butcher

12:17.880 --> 12:19.980
has your niece,
she's already dead.
SHELBY: No,

12:19.982 --> 12:22.048
it's not the Butcher.
It was a little girl.

12:22.050 --> 12:23.116
Flora called her Priscilla.

12:23.118 --> 12:25.952
(wind chimes jangling)

12:25.954 --> 12:27.053
Priscilla?

12:27.055 --> 12:28.889
You know her?

12:28.891 --> 12:30.757
I know where she likes to play.

12:30.759 --> 12:32.859
(door opens)

12:45.808 --> 12:48.775
I felt horrible about Lee.

12:48.777 --> 12:51.945
The only reason the police
were questioning her

12:51.947 --> 12:53.847
about Mason's death...

12:56.084 --> 12:58.018
...was because of me.

12:58.020 --> 13:00.120
I figured the only real way
to clear Lee's name

13:00.122 --> 13:01.922
was to find Flora, alive.

13:01.924 --> 13:05.292
If we didn't...

13:05.294 --> 13:07.093
nothing would save my sister.

13:07.095 --> 13:10.697
ELIAS: Your little spirit
kidnapper likes to hang

13:10.699 --> 13:12.465
on the periphery,
with the others.

13:12.467 --> 13:15.202
MATT: Others?
Yeah, the other spirits.

13:15.204 --> 13:17.003
They're all victims
of the Butcher's.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.672
They're bound to the land,
for whatever reason,

13:18.674 --> 13:20.040
I don't pretend to understand,

13:20.042 --> 13:21.308
I-I know what I know.

13:21.310 --> 13:24.711
I actually couldn't believe
that we were...

13:26.181 --> 13:28.148
...back out
in those woods again.

13:28.150 --> 13:32.719
And with this stranger
we'd seen ranting and raving

13:32.721 --> 13:34.020
on those videotapes.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.323
I trusted him.

13:36.325 --> 13:38.458
He knew things.

13:38.460 --> 13:41.361
He knew about Priscilla.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.463
When he described her
to us, this...

13:43.465 --> 13:45.832
this... dead girl,

13:45.834 --> 13:48.368
playing in the woods,

13:48.370 --> 13:50.937
I realized we'd seen her, too.

13:52.975 --> 13:55.308
<i> She was the one</i>
<i> who led us to the root cellar.</i>

13:55.310 --> 13:57.711
<i> To the videotapes.</i>

13:57.713 --> 13:59.346
<i> To Elias.</i>

13:59.348 --> 14:03.316
<i> And now, maybe he was</i>
<i> leading us back to her.</i>

14:03.318 --> 14:05.151
<i> And back to our niece.</i>

14:05.153 --> 14:08.154
(cackles echoing)
Don't listen to it!
Keep moving.

14:08.156 --> 14:10.223
The hell is that?

14:19.201 --> 14:21.835
(growls)

14:24.406 --> 14:26.506
SHELBY:
<i>I don't know what possessed me.</i>

14:26.508 --> 14:28.241
(panting)

14:28.243 --> 14:31.044
<i> Something about those woods...</i>

14:31.046 --> 14:32.946
(cackling continues)

14:32.948 --> 14:34.915
<i> ...made you lose control.</i>

14:39.922 --> 14:41.788
(cackling stops)

14:41.790 --> 14:44.791
(birds singing)

14:46.962 --> 14:48.361
¶ ¶

14:57.439 --> 14:59.239
(gasps)

14:59.241 --> 15:00.974
Croatoan!

15:02.544 --> 15:04.945
Croatoan!

15:04.947 --> 15:06.947
Ooh!
Shh! That's...
that's not gonna work.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.249
(Shelby panting)

15:09.251 --> 15:10.951
Come on.

15:10.953 --> 15:14.087
It was a six-day cycle, he said.

15:14.089 --> 15:16.389
And once it started,

15:16.391 --> 15:19.125
the spirits slipped the veil

15:19.127 --> 15:21.962
between the shadow world
and ours.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.132
MATT:
<i> It was...</i>

15:26.134 --> 15:29.002
impossible,
what I was looking at.

15:29.004 --> 15:31.137
(echoing laughter)
<i> But there it was.</i>

15:33.642 --> 15:37.177
She had been out there for days,
and we were so close

15:37.179 --> 15:39.813
to getting her back.

15:39.815 --> 15:41.414
Flora!
No! No, no...

15:41.416 --> 15:43.984
Flora!
Listen to me.
It's too dangerous!

15:43.986 --> 15:46.953
The little dead girl knows me.
I need to do this!

15:46.955 --> 15:49.055
Matthew...

15:50.525 --> 15:52.525
Priscilla?

15:52.527 --> 15:54.995
Priscilla.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.263
It's Elias.
You remember me, don't you?

15:57.265 --> 16:00.166
You need to let your
little friend come with us.

16:00.168 --> 16:03.036
Yeah? She needs to come home.

16:03.038 --> 16:05.672
(hunting horn blows)

16:08.543 --> 16:11.011
(horn blows again)

16:13.115 --> 16:16.516
(screaming)

16:16.518 --> 16:18.685
(horn blows again)

16:20.789 --> 16:22.122
No!

16:22.124 --> 16:24.190
(shouting)

16:25.627 --> 16:27.060
Come on!
(Shelby whimpers)

16:27.062 --> 16:29.129
SHELBY:
<i> She was gone</i>

16:29.131 --> 16:31.464
<i> and I still didn't know</i>
<i> if she was alive or dead.</i>

16:31.466 --> 16:34.801
<i>And was she really one of them?</i>

16:34.803 --> 16:38.038
<i> All I knew was that</i>
<i> we couldn't stay out there.</i>

16:38.040 --> 16:40.040
(panting)
(door opens)

16:40.042 --> 16:43.143
You two look a fright.

16:43.145 --> 16:47.147
You ready to do things
my way, now?

16:58.660 --> 17:00.427
SHELBY:<i> I mean, I can't tell you</i>
<i> how low we felt.</i>

17:00.429 --> 17:02.829
We feared the worst.

17:02.831 --> 17:06.032
CRICKET:
Dead? No, no, no, no, no.

17:06.034 --> 17:09.169
That sweet little girl
is not lost.

17:09.171 --> 17:11.071
Now, sit just yourselves down

17:11.073 --> 17:14.407
and set your minds
at ease. (sighs)

17:14.409 --> 17:18.011
I feel Flora's life force,
and I feel it strongly.

17:18.013 --> 17:20.380
I'm not pointing fingers,

17:20.382 --> 17:23.016
but you more than likely
would have her back now

17:23.018 --> 17:24.784
if you hadn't made
a liar out of me.

17:24.786 --> 17:28.621
I told that butcher you'd leave,
and you sure as hell didn't.

17:28.623 --> 17:30.457
We will do anything
to get her back.

17:30.459 --> 17:33.259
You tell the
Butcher that.
Yeah.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.928
Well, about that...

17:34.930 --> 17:38.198
After my little contretemps,

17:38.200 --> 17:40.033
I did seek her out again.

17:40.035 --> 17:42.302
But mama was in no mood.

17:42.304 --> 17:43.803
Be gone.

17:43.805 --> 17:47.040
Another warning
thou shalt not receive.

17:47.042 --> 17:49.976
I ask only for your patience.
My interest

17:49.978 --> 17:52.378
in bartering has ended,
and so has my mercy.

17:52.380 --> 17:53.713
I need

17:53.715 --> 17:55.548
none of thine aid.

17:55.550 --> 17:59.252
All power now is from the moon.

17:59.254 --> 18:02.789
¶ ¶

18:02.791 --> 18:06.092
Honestly, I'd murder
for a Coke Zero.

18:06.094 --> 18:08.928
I got to get my wits about me,

18:08.930 --> 18:11.564
and figure out
exactly what it is

18:11.566 --> 18:12.832
we're dealing with.

18:12.834 --> 18:15.635
If I can understand
their strengths...

18:15.637 --> 18:16.970
(sips)

18:16.972 --> 18:19.272
...maybe I can suss out
a weakness.

18:19.274 --> 18:21.941
You're going
back out there?

18:21.943 --> 18:24.144
I have to get it
from the horse's mouth, darlin'.

18:27.115 --> 18:29.983
MATT:<i> Being unable</i>
<i> to take action was torture.</i>

18:29.985 --> 18:31.651
SHELBY:
<i> I started to worry</i>

18:31.653 --> 18:33.620
<i> that we'd lost him, too.</i>

18:33.622 --> 18:36.022
But when he came back,

18:36.024 --> 18:37.924
one look at his face

18:37.926 --> 18:41.361
and there was no doubt that he'd
been through something hellish.

18:47.602 --> 18:49.702
How long was I out there?
SHELBY: Hours.

18:49.704 --> 18:51.004
MATT:
What the hell happened?

18:51.006 --> 18:53.006
I met her...

18:53.008 --> 18:55.975
and I lived
to tell the tale.

18:55.977 --> 18:58.811
But there were moments I felt
my survival was in doubt.

18:58.813 --> 19:00.713
The Butcher?

19:00.715 --> 19:03.116
Oh, no, darlin'.

19:03.118 --> 19:05.685
I meant the bitch
with the<i> real</i> power.

19:06.955 --> 19:09.222
Show yourself to me!

19:10.992 --> 19:14.427
The day of reckoning
is upon you!

19:16.998 --> 19:21.034
What is your name,
little man?

19:21.036 --> 19:22.735
My eyes!

19:22.737 --> 19:24.571
What have you done to me?

19:24.573 --> 19:26.139
(Scathach laughing)

19:26.141 --> 19:28.575
SCATHACH:
Losing your sight...
(cries out)

19:28.577 --> 19:33.046
is the least of your problems.

19:33.048 --> 19:34.914
(sharp grunt, yelp)

19:36.885 --> 19:39.886
You're wrong.
I can see.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.655
You are the master

19:42.657 --> 19:44.157
behind all of them.

19:44.159 --> 19:45.925
The Butcher
and her wraiths.

19:45.927 --> 19:50.730
And your power grows
with each phase of the moon.

19:50.732 --> 19:53.066
(whispers):
As do your needs.

19:54.202 --> 19:56.836
What needs?

19:56.838 --> 19:58.738
Those of a woman.

19:58.740 --> 20:01.741
It's inevitable.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.010
CRICKET:
<i> I offered her the only thing</i>

20:04.012 --> 20:05.078
<i> I knew she wanted...</i>

20:05.080 --> 20:07.146
Matthew.

20:08.783 --> 20:09.949
You what?

20:09.951 --> 20:11.951
I had to give her something.

20:11.953 --> 20:14.287
And you were the only
thing she needed.

20:14.289 --> 20:17.023
Oh, don't look
at me like that.

20:17.025 --> 20:19.959
It's not like you have
to actually sleep with her.

20:19.961 --> 20:21.094
I just put it
on the table

20:21.096 --> 20:22.895
so I could get her to talk.

20:22.897 --> 20:25.365
And she told you why
all of this was happening?

20:25.367 --> 20:26.366
Oh, honey, she did
more than that.

20:26.368 --> 20:28.101
She<i> showed</i> me.

20:28.103 --> 20:32.939
CRICKET:<i> She took my hand,</i>
<i> and the black veil was lifted.</i>

20:32.941 --> 20:34.874
<i> I could see again.</i>

20:37.912 --> 20:41.147
<i> But I was no longer</i>
<i> in the forest.</i>

20:43.084 --> 20:46.953
She had hurtled me
centuries into the past.

20:46.955 --> 20:50.323
Smack dab in the middle
of one of the greatest

20:50.325 --> 20:53.559
unsolved mysteries
there ever was.

20:53.561 --> 20:56.429
Your house, this land,

20:56.431 --> 20:59.465
is the site of the true

20:59.467 --> 21:02.802
lost colony of Roanoke.

21:02.804 --> 21:05.571
But they were never lost.
They came here.

21:05.573 --> 21:09.142
And they were living
in the horn of plenty.

21:17.852 --> 21:20.687
CRICKET:
<i> But there was a price to pay</i>

21:20.689 --> 21:23.022
<i> for all this bliss.</i>

21:23.024 --> 21:25.658
(praying in foreign language)

21:35.937 --> 21:37.036
(Cricket gasps)

21:40.975 --> 21:44.010
Human sacrifice.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.144
They were practicing
devil worship.

21:45.146 --> 21:47.280
CRICKET:
Not devil worship.

21:47.282 --> 21:49.982
There are older religions,

21:49.984 --> 21:52.885
more cruel than anyone
could imagine.

21:52.887 --> 21:55.621
But not all
were on board

21:55.623 --> 21:58.057
for this little turn
to the dark side.

21:58.059 --> 22:00.193
The Butcher had a son.

22:00.195 --> 22:04.197
Oi, oi, Mother.

22:04.199 --> 22:07.900
Thou hast turned thy back
on the true faith.

22:07.902 --> 22:09.969
Thrown us in league with Satan

22:09.971 --> 22:13.072
under the dark sorcery
of that witch of the wood.

22:13.074 --> 22:16.309
She hath poisoned thy mind
with foul treachery!

22:16.311 --> 22:18.044
I heard nary an objection

22:18.046 --> 22:21.748
when you were cold
and starvin', my son.

22:21.750 --> 22:25.885
Only men with full bellies
have the luxury of conscience.

22:25.887 --> 22:29.322
A conscience we should abide.

22:29.324 --> 22:32.558
I confess, I stood in silence

22:32.560 --> 22:33.893
while thou didst welcome evil

22:33.895 --> 22:35.428
into our midst.

22:35.430 --> 22:39.365
But I know now there is only
one thing I need fear.

22:39.367 --> 22:43.269
The eternal wrath of our
Almighty Lord in heaven!

22:43.271 --> 22:44.637
(assenting murmurs)

22:46.007 --> 22:48.908
I pray for thee, Mother,

22:48.910 --> 22:52.178
that He will be merciful
come Judgment Day.

22:52.180 --> 22:55.047
We shall return
from whence we came

22:55.049 --> 22:57.784
and await Father's ships
to take us home.

23:13.134 --> 23:16.035
Ungrateful wretches.

23:17.572 --> 23:23.276
My hardship and sacrifice
are met with mutiny?

23:23.278 --> 23:27.914
Cast out the traitorous,
petulant babes!

23:27.916 --> 23:32.685
They are all children
in need of discipline.

23:33.988 --> 23:36.989
Bend them to thy will.

23:36.991 --> 23:40.159
Shed their blood.

23:40.161 --> 23:45.832
Release the power
of the Blood Moon.

23:45.834 --> 23:51.237
Thou shalt have their
souls enslaved to thee--

23:51.239 --> 23:54.273
thy servants

23:54.275 --> 23:58.010
for eternity.

23:58.012 --> 24:02.448
I near fell prey
to the witch's seduction.

24:02.450 --> 24:06.085
This brave new world
hath tested our devotion,

24:06.087 --> 24:08.788
our faith.

24:08.790 --> 24:12.024
But God hath spoken to me,

24:12.026 --> 24:14.927
and I wish to repent.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.367
The Lord preaches forgiveness

24:21.369 --> 24:24.504
for those who
repent their sins.

24:24.506 --> 24:28.174
This is joyous news.
Praise be to God.

24:28.176 --> 24:31.177
Praise be to God.

24:32.514 --> 24:35.681
As a token
of my repentance,

24:35.683 --> 24:38.484
let us mark
the new days ahead

24:38.486 --> 24:40.953
with special fruit.

24:40.955 --> 24:44.790
A symbol of the New World's
benevolence unto us.

24:46.060 --> 24:50.296
In the name of Jesus Christ
we pray.

24:50.298 --> 24:52.131
Amen.

24:52.133 --> 24:53.266
ALL:
Amen.

25:06.514 --> 25:09.115
(people coughing, gagging)

25:10.718 --> 25:12.818
(all coughing, gagging)

25:24.365 --> 25:27.133
(coughing, gagging echoing)

25:30.338 --> 25:34.774
Fat, lazy ingrates!

25:34.776 --> 25:38.511
Reeking with the stench
of piety.

25:38.513 --> 25:41.347
Hast thou no loyalty?

25:41.349 --> 25:44.116
I bled for thee!

25:44.118 --> 25:46.786
And thou wouldst reward
my devotion

25:46.788 --> 25:49.922
with apostasy...

25:49.924 --> 25:52.925
insolence...

25:52.927 --> 25:55.294
deceit!

25:55.296 --> 25:58.965
If thou wishes not
to follow me in this life,

25:58.967 --> 26:02.802
thou will follow me
in the next.

26:02.804 --> 26:04.937
(people choking, retching)

26:04.939 --> 26:08.307
We shall never leave
this place.

26:08.309 --> 26:10.276
This is our land.

26:10.278 --> 26:14.547
I will soak this earth
with our blood,

26:14.549 --> 26:17.950
let it mingle with the soil,

26:17.952 --> 26:20.553
tether us to these grounds

26:20.555 --> 26:22.455
forever!

26:52.787 --> 26:55.154
(Scathach's laughter echoes)

26:59.260 --> 27:04.096
It was a blood sacrifice
to the ancient gods,

27:04.098 --> 27:06.499
an offering so great
it consecrated this ground,

27:06.501 --> 27:10.970
bonding them to all
of it for eternity.

27:10.972 --> 27:13.873
That's why every year,
on the anniversary

27:13.875 --> 27:15.675
of the slaughter,

27:15.677 --> 27:20.546
these spirits go from being
merely loathsome to lethal.

27:20.548 --> 27:22.515
But we can't just
pack up and leave.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.650
Flora is still out there.

27:24.652 --> 27:26.152
You won't have to.

27:26.154 --> 27:29.288
Not after what that
witch woman showed me.

27:29.290 --> 27:31.657
I know a spell that can put

27:31.659 --> 27:35.895
the Butcher and her
spirits down for good.

27:35.897 --> 27:39.065
After they come here
tonight....

27:39.067 --> 27:40.966
I'll put an end to this.

27:40.968 --> 27:43.169
(cell phone vibrates)

27:43.171 --> 27:45.905
Oh, that's my Uber.

27:45.907 --> 27:48.574
Well, now, wait-wait
a damn minute.

27:48.576 --> 27:50.676
You just said you can put an end
to this and you're leaving?

27:50.678 --> 27:52.745
I have to go back
to my hotel room

27:52.747 --> 27:54.046
to get a few things I need.

27:54.048 --> 27:57.049
Sage, sacred herbs.

27:57.051 --> 27:59.685
Pocketbook of chants.

27:59.687 --> 28:01.821
Stay put.
I'll be back.

28:01.823 --> 28:03.255
SHELBY:
<i> Once he told us</i>

28:03.257 --> 28:06.058
that he could bring
an end to all this,

28:06.060 --> 28:08.160
it was all we wanted to hear.

28:08.162 --> 28:11.664
<i> We just had to hold out</i>
<i> until he got back.</i>

28:11.666 --> 28:12.732
Where to?

28:12.734 --> 28:15.267
The Royal Crown Motor Hotel.

28:17.205 --> 28:18.404
Tell me, young man.

28:18.406 --> 28:20.106
Have you ever heard the term

28:20.108 --> 28:21.607
"gay for pay"?

28:22.744 --> 28:24.744
(tires screech)
(horn honks)

28:24.746 --> 28:25.745
(gasps)

28:25.747 --> 28:28.047
(panting)

28:28.049 --> 28:31.517
Lord have mercy...

28:42.964 --> 28:44.296
MATT:
<i> He'd been gone for hours.</i>

28:44.298 --> 28:45.297
<i> There was no answer</i>
<i> when I called his motel.</i>

28:45.299 --> 28:46.465
I was starting to worry.

28:50.037 --> 28:51.570
Oh... hey.

28:51.572 --> 28:53.038
He's still not here?

28:53.040 --> 28:55.141
He will be.

28:58.613 --> 29:01.046
I should stay awake.

29:01.048 --> 29:02.748
They come
when you sleep.

29:02.750 --> 29:04.216
They come either way.

29:04.218 --> 29:05.885
Rest.

29:05.887 --> 29:08.420
Come on, I'm here.

29:08.422 --> 29:10.990
Come on, Shel.

29:22.937 --> 29:24.804
(sighs)

29:24.806 --> 29:26.639
MATT:
<i> I don't know how long I slept.</i>

29:26.641 --> 29:28.140
I was losing
all track of time.

29:28.142 --> 29:30.176
The days were bleeding
into nights.

29:31.312 --> 29:32.845
(distant clanking)

29:52.700 --> 29:54.767
(door creaking)

29:59.340 --> 30:02.508
<i> I heard noises.</i>

30:02.510 --> 30:05.277
<i> Whispers all around me. </i>
(overlapping whispers)

30:05.279 --> 30:06.879
<i> They weren't words,</i>

30:06.881 --> 30:09.415
exactly, but they drew me.

30:15.356 --> 30:18.290
(overlapping whispers continue)

30:24.498 --> 30:28.200
(louder whispering)

30:28.202 --> 30:30.536
(thud)

30:31.839 --> 30:34.406
<i> Someone was down there.</i>

30:34.408 --> 30:35.741
For a moment
I thought maybe...

30:35.743 --> 30:37.176
maybe it was Elias.

30:37.178 --> 30:38.878
Maybe he hadn't
died in the woods.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.913
Maybe he'd dragged himself
back there.

30:40.915 --> 30:43.482
<i> Back to where he'd</i>
<i> once been safe.</i>

30:43.484 --> 30:45.684
Hey!

30:45.686 --> 30:48.254
<i> But it wasn't Elias.</i>

30:55.663 --> 30:58.330
My treasure.

30:58.332 --> 31:00.099
Stay away from me.

31:02.370 --> 31:03.602
What do you want from me?

31:03.604 --> 31:05.004
Debts must

31:05.006 --> 31:06.038
be paid.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.239
MATT:
<i> I tried to resist,</i>

31:07.241 --> 31:09.074
<i> but it was impossible.</i>

31:15.016 --> 31:18.117
SHELBY:
<i>I was all alone when I woke up.</i>

31:18.119 --> 31:20.953
I had never been
so scared in my life.

31:20.955 --> 31:22.588
Matt?

31:27.428 --> 31:29.828
Matt?

31:31.065 --> 31:33.132
(wind whistles,
wind chimes jingle)

31:37.138 --> 31:40.139
¶ ¶

31:41.809 --> 31:43.943
MATT:
<i> I was under some spell.</i>

31:43.945 --> 31:46.712
<i> She was opening herself to me.</i>

31:46.714 --> 31:48.948
<i> Not just her body,</i>
<i> but who she was.</i>

31:48.950 --> 31:52.284
<i> Through her words</i>
<i> and her touch,</i>

31:52.286 --> 31:53.919
<i> it all came rushing at me--</i>

31:53.921 --> 31:55.120
<i> her experience,</i>

31:55.122 --> 31:56.689
<i> her story, her pain.</i>

31:59.060 --> 32:01.126
<i> It was the most intimate</i>
<i> connection I have</i>

32:01.128 --> 32:02.895
<i> ever experienced.</i>

32:04.398 --> 32:06.432
She had been
an English girl, once.

32:06.434 --> 32:10.002
<i> A descendant of the Druids</i>
<i> and their Roman conquerors.</i>

32:10.004 --> 32:13.973
SCATHACH:
<i> My people worshipped</i>
<i> the old gods.</i>

32:13.975 --> 32:16.809
<i> I left England a stowaway.</i>

32:16.811 --> 32:20.646
<i> The voyage was plagued</i>
<i> with misfortune.</i>

32:20.648 --> 32:22.448
<i> Many men died.</i>

32:22.450 --> 32:24.850
<i> I was discovered</i>

32:24.852 --> 32:27.286
<i> upon landing</i>
<i> in this New World.</i>

32:27.288 --> 32:31.690
<i> The soldiers blamed me</i>
<i> for the tumultuous journey.</i>

32:31.692 --> 32:33.592
No! No!

32:33.594 --> 32:36.028
<i> They believed</i>
<i> it angered the sea gods</i>

32:36.030 --> 32:39.665
<i> to travel</i>
<i> with a woman on board.</i>

32:39.667 --> 32:44.470
<i> It was decided I would be</i>
<i> burned at the stake</i>

32:44.472 --> 32:47.539
<i> as a witch.</i>

32:47.541 --> 32:51.844
<i> But there were other gods</i>
<i> demanding blood.</i>

32:51.846 --> 32:53.879
<i> More ancient</i>

32:53.881 --> 32:56.081
<i> and thirsty gods.</i>

33:08.162 --> 33:09.528
MATT:
<i> The massacre</i>
<i> of the white soldiers</i>

33:09.530 --> 33:11.463
<i> was blamed on the Indians</i>

33:11.465 --> 33:14.233
<i> and she escaped into the wild.</i>

33:15.469 --> 33:19.038
<i> The old magic and New World</i>

33:19.040 --> 33:21.540
<i> created something new.</i>

33:21.542 --> 33:24.143
<i> Something original.</i>

33:25.913 --> 33:27.980
PRODUCER: Why do you think
she showed you all this?

33:27.982 --> 33:31.683
She wanted me
to understand her.

33:31.685 --> 33:34.086
She wanted me to join her.

33:34.088 --> 33:36.622
And I would have.

33:43.164 --> 33:46.432
(indistinct chanting)

33:48.269 --> 33:51.203
(Flora sobbing)

33:51.205 --> 33:53.072
Matt!

33:54.942 --> 33:56.775
Matt!

33:56.777 --> 33:59.011
(gasps)

33:59.013 --> 34:01.013
(both shout)

34:01.015 --> 34:03.248
(moaning)

34:03.250 --> 34:04.783
Matt!

34:04.785 --> 34:07.019
Shelby!
SHELBY:
Matt!

34:07.021 --> 34:09.054
MATT:
<i> They were everywhere.</i>

34:09.056 --> 34:10.289
Matt, they have her!
They have Flora!

34:10.291 --> 34:11.623
Flora!

34:11.625 --> 34:12.724
(gasps)

34:12.726 --> 34:13.959
Give her back to us.

34:13.961 --> 34:15.060
That's all we want.

34:15.062 --> 34:16.128
And then we'll leave.

34:16.130 --> 34:18.197
Time for bartering
has ended.

34:18.199 --> 34:19.765
It's time for the land
to be reclaimed

34:19.767 --> 34:22.601
and consecrated
with fresh blood!

34:22.603 --> 34:24.236
No!
(Shelby gasps)

34:24.238 --> 34:25.404
Run!

34:25.406 --> 34:27.773
Run, Matt!

34:27.775 --> 34:30.476
Run!

34:30.478 --> 34:32.144
Evil child!

34:32.146 --> 34:34.046
(screams)

34:37.918 --> 34:41.153
Sweetheart.
(shushing)

34:41.155 --> 34:43.122
I don't think
this is her blood.

34:43.124 --> 34:45.757
Honey, look at me.

34:45.759 --> 34:46.959
Are you hurt?

34:46.961 --> 34:49.061
The man.

34:49.063 --> 34:50.562
Sweetheart,

34:50.564 --> 34:52.131
what man?

34:52.133 --> 34:54.833
The man.

34:54.835 --> 34:56.401
MATT:
What man, sweetie?
(distant screaming)

34:56.403 --> 34:59.138
FLORA:
The man...

35:00.975 --> 35:02.975
(gasps):
Oh!

35:03.644 --> 35:04.910
Oh, Matt.

35:04.912 --> 35:05.978
Matt...

35:05.980 --> 35:08.147
(Matt gasps)

35:10.284 --> 35:12.317
(Cricket whimpering)

35:12.319 --> 35:13.986
MATT:
<i> There was a reason</i>
<i> he hadn't come back.</i>

35:13.988 --> 35:16.155
He hadn't gotten
very far at all.

35:16.157 --> 35:19.091
I picked him up
around dawn, I guess.

35:21.195 --> 35:23.295
<i> He kind of stuck out,</i>
<i> you know?</i>

35:23.297 --> 35:25.130
Tell me, young man,
have you ever heard

35:25.132 --> 35:27.533
the term "gay for pay"?

35:28.702 --> 35:30.669
(tires screech)
(horn honks)

35:30.671 --> 35:33.972
(gasps)
It was just a question!

35:33.974 --> 35:35.507
(panting)

35:35.509 --> 35:39.044
Lord have mercy.

35:39.046 --> 35:40.812
Flora!

35:40.814 --> 35:42.114
Come back!

35:42.116 --> 35:43.849
Punkin', come back!

35:43.851 --> 35:45.484
RHETT:
<i> I waited around and</i>

35:45.486 --> 35:47.986
he never came out, so I left.

35:47.988 --> 35:50.122
You know, I just prayed to God
everyone was all right.

35:50.124 --> 35:52.024
(whimpering)

35:59.166 --> 36:00.065
(both gasp)

36:00.067 --> 36:02.868
(screaming)

36:12.980 --> 36:14.746
SHELBY:
<i> That poor man.</i>

36:14.748 --> 36:18.150
And there was nothing
that we could do.

36:18.152 --> 36:20.419
(moaning)

36:25.192 --> 36:27.626
(shouting)

36:34.368 --> 36:36.435
(screaming)

36:36.437 --> 36:39.071
Back!

36:39.073 --> 36:41.039
Back.

36:41.041 --> 36:44.109
MATT:<i> I had heard about</i>
<i> disemboweling, but</i>

36:44.111 --> 36:45.611

<i> Her message was clear.</i>

36:56.957 --> 36:59.024
<i> We were next.</i>
