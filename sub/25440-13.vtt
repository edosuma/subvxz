Episode Title :
<font color=#FFFF00>"The Eye of Pincosta"</font>

00:48.360 --> 00:50.585
The hamlet of Pincosta.

00:50.671 --> 00:52.862
Known for its warm smiles,

00:52.948 --> 00:57.768
hearty handshakes and world
famous Pincostan Pecan Pie!

00:57.854 --> 00:58.866
What'd you do?

00:58.952 --> 01:00.241
Memorize the travel guide?

01:00.327 --> 01:01.842
Uh, only through the V's.

01:01.928 --> 01:04.553
That's why I wasn't very much
help in Zuhlberg.

01:04.780 --> 01:06.952
Did someone say pecan pie?

01:07.038 --> 01:09.264
What are we waiting for?
Can't this thing go any faster?

01:09.350 --> 01:11.108
Never mind,
I'll meet you there.

01:14.256 --> 01:16.053
Probably should have waited
until we got to

01:16.139 --> 01:17.147
the bottom of the hill.

01:17.233 --> 01:19.582
Do we have to go
to the Hamlet of Pincosta?

01:19.668 --> 01:21.652
I mean,
what is a hamlet anyway?

01:21.737 --> 01:23.154
Sounds like a tiny ham.

01:23.239 --> 01:24.255
Am I right?

01:24.340 --> 01:26.058
No, thank you.

01:26.342 --> 01:28.406
 And you can get a
hearty handshake anywhere.

01:28.492 --> 01:29.961
Look, I say
we take the scenic route.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.829
I love scenic routes,
you love scenic routes!

01:31.914 --> 01:34.214
And you know why?
'Cause there's scenery.

01:34.538 --> 01:37.125
Eugene,
are you wanted here?

01:37.252 --> 01:40.414
Yes, I am wanted here.
Very, very much so.

01:40.765 --> 01:43.625
We have to go, Eugene.
We need food.

01:46.048 --> 01:47.243
We've got plenty of food!

01:47.329 --> 01:49.355
Look how full this thing is!

01:51.825 --> 01:53.089
Shorty's in here, isn't he?

01:53.175 --> 01:54.714
Just five more minutes, Mom.

01:59.241 --> 02:01.089
You know, on second thought,

02:01.175 --> 02:03.464
maybe I should just hang back
with the camper.

02:03.550 --> 02:04.995
Don't worry, Eugene.

02:05.179 --> 02:07.519
These people have
probably long forgotten...

02:07.605 --> 02:09.000
Look, it's Flynn Rider!

02:10.911 --> 02:14.128
So, how's about one of those hearty
handshakes I've heard so much about?

02:16.225 --> 02:18.487
Five minutes in town
and he's already arrested.

02:18.592 --> 02:20.222
That's a new record.

02:21.533 --> 02:23.547
All right, where is he?

02:23.633 --> 02:26.383
Well hello, Flynn Rider.

02:26.469 --> 02:28.250
Long time no see.

02:28.336 --> 02:31.156
- Uh, Constable Lumph is it?
- Wait, wait!

02:31.242 --> 02:33.101
Don't ruin my moment.

02:37.613 --> 02:38.867
Lewis...

02:40.482 --> 02:42.132
Oh yeah!

02:42.218 --> 02:45.369
I've been waiting
so long to do that.

02:45.532 --> 02:47.365
Let me do it again.

02:47.904 --> 02:49.487
Oh, yeah!

02:49.573 --> 02:52.203
Great. Okay,
back to the charges?

02:52.289 --> 02:54.679
This rapscallion walked away

02:54.765 --> 02:57.484
with the town's
most sacred treasure:

02:57.570 --> 03:00.298
the Eye of Pincosta.
Which is...

03:00.384 --> 03:02.386
Which is the biggest
diamond in all the land.

03:02.471 --> 03:04.476
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I read the travel guide.

03:04.562 --> 03:06.703
The second biggest, actually.

03:06.809 --> 03:08.289
Zuhlberg's is bigger.

03:08.375 --> 03:09.892
Zuhlberg.

03:09.978 --> 03:11.895
Okay, yes.
I stole the Eye.

03:11.981 --> 03:14.789
But that was ages ago.
I'm a changed man!

03:18.354 --> 03:21.062
Granted I did just pick
your jail cell lock.

03:21.398 --> 03:22.827
Habit?

03:24.980 --> 03:26.961
I'd have been fine with
"don't do that."

03:27.101 --> 03:28.778
Under Pincosta law,

03:28.864 --> 03:33.015
I sentence Flynn Rider to
a lifetime of servitude...

03:33.101 --> 03:36.857
in the Copper Mines
of Malanay.

03:38.006 --> 03:40.357
The Copper Mines of Malanay.

03:40.442 --> 03:43.507
Miles upon miles of caves
where miners are forced

03:43.593 --> 03:47.570
to dig day and night
without rest, food or light.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.967
It's a very thorough guide.

03:50.052 --> 03:54.960
The thing is, I actually am kind of more
of a rest, food, and light type of person.

03:55.046 --> 03:56.687
So, how do you feel about
community service?

03:56.773 --> 03:59.187
Because I will pick up your
litter like nobody's business.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.367
Don't worry, Eugene.

04:00.453 --> 04:02.947
We will break you
out of here in no time.

04:04.999 --> 04:09.018
Ha ha ha!
Lance, funny guy.

04:09.104 --> 04:11.601
He is just always
the jokester.

04:11.711 --> 04:16.117
Oh, right!
I'm joking.

04:16.202 --> 04:19.617
Definitely won't
break you out of here.

04:19.702 --> 04:20.765
Yes, we will.

04:20.851 --> 04:22.623
Just messing with ya!

04:22.731 --> 04:24.000
No I'm not.

04:25.828 --> 04:28.339
Sometime, we're going to have
to have a frank discussion

04:28.424 --> 04:29.898
about whisper volume.

04:29.984 --> 04:31.067
Constable, wait!

04:34.045 --> 04:36.836
What if I
could find the Eye?

04:37.050 --> 04:39.273
Hmm. How?

04:39.507 --> 04:41.023
Let me worry about that.

04:41.109 --> 04:44.265
If I can find it,
would you release Eugene?

04:44.406 --> 04:47.117
And also everybody else?

04:49.047 --> 04:50.864
Blondie, do not do this.

04:51.019 --> 04:53.937
I am not letting you
go to those mines.

04:55.213 --> 04:59.453
The carriage to the mines
leaves in two days.

04:59.539 --> 05:04.539
So the jewel better be
in my hands in 48 hours.

05:04.765 --> 05:09.329
Or your friends will toil
in the mines forever.

05:10.433 --> 05:13.418
Okay, if I have any chance
of tracking the Eye down,

05:13.504 --> 05:15.821
you have
to tell me everything.

05:15.907 --> 05:19.233
Uh, well...
What's to tell really?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.124
You know, I stole a thing.
A thing was stolen.

05:21.210 --> 05:22.226
That's the end
of the story.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.984
And you have no idea
where it is?

05:26.008 --> 05:28.617
Eugene. What is it?

05:28.976 --> 05:31.343
Okay, see, the thing is,
it was a two-man job.

05:31.429 --> 05:33.899
So if anyone knows where the
Eye is, it would be my partner.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.547
Who? Lance?

05:36.516 --> 05:38.164
Not Lance.

05:47.825 --> 05:50.336
Oh, is it my turn?

05:51.625 --> 05:54.259
Oops.

05:55.644 --> 05:57.484
Aw, nuts!

05:57.631 --> 06:00.297
Looks like I have
to buy you lunch.

06:00.383 --> 06:03.133
Unless...
can we play again?

06:03.763 --> 06:06.381
Sure. But let's make
it more interesting.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.070
Your ruby necklace
for...

06:08.156 --> 06:10.648
Your cutlass and
diamond-studded dagger?

06:17.943 --> 06:19.393
What the...?

06:19.554 --> 06:21.914
Thanks for the game.

06:28.105 --> 06:31.582
Wow. Didn't think
Princess Sunshine

06:31.668 --> 06:34.058
could find me in a place
as shady as this.

06:34.144 --> 06:37.004
Well, maybe you're not
the judge of character

06:37.090 --> 06:38.098
you thought you were.

06:38.184 --> 06:40.387
Let me guess:
Rider's in trouble,

06:40.473 --> 06:43.387
and you want
my help to save him.

06:43.692 --> 06:46.504
Yeah. I need to find
the Eye of Pincosta.

06:46.590 --> 06:48.574
And you two
stole it together.

06:48.664 --> 06:51.137
We stole a lot of things
together.

06:51.223 --> 06:54.293
Yeah, I know where it is
but why would I help you?

06:54.379 --> 06:56.957
Because I'm charming?

06:57.256 --> 06:59.012
It was worth a shot.

06:59.308 --> 07:03.160
I think you'll help because
you still care about Eugene.

07:03.283 --> 07:05.295
And there's good
in everybody.

07:05.381 --> 07:08.499
Ha! And you are a terrible
judge of character.

07:08.584 --> 07:11.137
I want nothing to do
with Rider.

07:11.223 --> 07:15.254
And doing the right thing has
never been a priority of mine.

07:15.891 --> 07:17.293
I'll pay you.

07:20.152 --> 07:22.777
This unlocks the trunk
back in our caravan.

07:22.863 --> 07:24.926
A trunk full of gold.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.578
It's all yours.

07:27.414 --> 07:29.449
Not to mention...

07:30.148 --> 07:32.472
The darts you and that guy
were playing with.

07:32.558 --> 07:36.344
Gosh, his are a lot heavier
than yours for some reason.

07:36.445 --> 07:38.824
Huh. It's almost like
you cheated.

07:38.910 --> 07:40.981
Maybe we should go
talk to that guy about this.

07:44.688 --> 07:47.952
He looks really mad.

07:48.312 --> 07:51.324
Guess we've got
a jewel to find, partner.

07:54.272 --> 07:56.101
If we want to get
the Eye of Pincosta back,

07:56.187 --> 07:57.328
we better get a move on.

07:57.414 --> 07:59.937
Right. I think... Wait...

08:00.039 --> 08:02.524
- Is this your horse?
- Of course not.

08:02.610 --> 08:05.086
- Well then whose is it?
- My horse!

08:07.171 --> 08:09.226
But it will be in a second.

08:11.936 --> 08:16.265
We were only admiring your
beautiful horse. Right, Stalyan?

08:16.351 --> 08:19.870
Hey, has he been
kind of out of sorts?

08:19.955 --> 08:23.387
He has been
a little ornery lately.

08:23.473 --> 08:26.168
Of course. Look, his
saddle is too loose,

08:26.254 --> 08:27.582
which is chafing his belly.

08:27.668 --> 08:30.293
And there's a thorn
in his bridle. Ouch!

08:30.379 --> 08:32.749
Also, don't hitch him
next to Rye grass.

08:32.835 --> 08:34.073
It gives horses
a tummy ache.

08:34.159 --> 08:36.152
Brown-top grass is much better.

08:36.238 --> 08:39.423
Good boy!
Isn't that much better?

08:40.642 --> 08:43.948
All right.
You take care now! Bye!

08:46.176 --> 08:48.337
Do you really think
I'm the type of person

08:48.423 --> 08:50.105
who would steal a horse?

08:50.613 --> 08:53.420
And you said I was
a bad judge of character?

08:54.499 --> 08:57.584
May I have a sip?
I am parched.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.988
Plenty of water
right over there.

09:04.020 --> 09:06.671
When you come up for air,

09:06.757 --> 09:08.941
maybe you could tell us
where the diamond is?

09:09.027 --> 09:11.345
Virtuous St. Goodberry.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.957
- Where is that?
- Not where, who.

09:14.042 --> 09:15.926
Eugene lost the Eye
to him years ago.

09:16.011 --> 09:19.246
If we want the Eye, we have
to get it from Goodberry.

09:20.020 --> 09:21.584
You know they make
cups for that?

09:21.670 --> 09:23.423
Yeah, but with a frying pan,

09:23.509 --> 09:26.193
Pascal and I
can drink at the same time.

09:26.279 --> 09:27.816
Look, we should
probably get moving.

09:27.902 --> 09:29.481
Goodberry's place
is a three-day walk.

09:29.567 --> 09:30.984
Three days?

09:31.070 --> 09:33.535
Why didn't you
say that before?

09:33.621 --> 09:36.172
We have less than two
to get that diamond!

09:36.258 --> 09:39.207
Well it would be one if somebody
would let us steal horses.

09:39.293 --> 09:43.011
I told you. We are not stealing...
anything.

09:44.725 --> 09:48.558
Goodberry's place
is due east, right?

09:48.707 --> 09:51.228
Whatever you're thinking
right now is an awful idea.

09:51.313 --> 09:54.915
 I told you
this was an awful idea!

09:55.496 --> 09:57.413
Uh, right. Go right!

09:57.499 --> 09:59.049
No we want the left!

09:59.135 --> 10:01.353
We needed to go right.

10:01.585 --> 10:03.753
Wrong.
Your way has rocks.

10:03.859 --> 10:07.339
Yeah, but your way has that!

10:07.425 --> 10:10.148
 And when were you
going to mention the waterfall?

10:10.234 --> 10:12.466
I was trying to!
But you interrupted me!

10:12.552 --> 10:14.153
 Well this
current is too strong.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.949
 And we're
gonna have to go over.

10:16.035 --> 10:17.148
We can do this.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.543
 Did I mention I hate you?

10:23.205 --> 10:25.589
Worst. Day. Ever.

10:25.675 --> 10:27.526
We made up
a lot of time, didn't we?

10:27.612 --> 10:29.962
You're right.
This worked out great.

10:30.132 --> 10:31.426
See ya.

10:32.955 --> 10:34.087
Stop!

10:34.957 --> 10:37.588
We have to jump off
at the same time.

10:37.674 --> 10:39.096
Or we're both going to fall.

10:39.182 --> 10:42.346
This is a fine situation
that you've gotten us into.

10:42.431 --> 10:43.801
On three. Ready?

10:43.887 --> 10:44.958
One...

10:45.044 --> 10:46.149
Two... Hey!

10:46.234 --> 10:48.535
You were supposed
to jump on three!

10:51.080 --> 10:52.705
That was a close one.

10:55.544 --> 10:56.676
Hang on!

11:01.783 --> 11:02.949
Gotcha.

11:06.755 --> 11:07.821
This is yours.

11:09.257 --> 11:10.556
Goodberry's tents.

11:10.884 --> 11:12.306
I can't believe it.

11:12.564 --> 11:15.064
What are we waiting for?
Come on!

11:25.123 --> 11:27.890
This cell is a little drafty.

11:27.976 --> 11:30.416
Okay, I don't like this
any more than you guys.

11:30.502 --> 11:33.392
But if we want to stay warm,
we've got to cuddle.

11:33.478 --> 11:36.056
Bring it in, bring it in.
Come on, bring it in guys.

11:36.644 --> 11:37.894
I'll freeze, thank you.

11:37.980 --> 11:39.902
And where do you
keep getting pie from?

11:39.988 --> 11:41.603
I'll never tell.

11:42.259 --> 11:43.986
Blondie's only got a day left.

11:44.072 --> 11:45.463
Oh, Rider!

11:45.588 --> 11:47.678
To get your mind off the Eye,

11:47.763 --> 11:49.666
I brought one of
my paintings.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.703
It's the Mines of Malanay.

11:51.843 --> 11:55.428
A preview of what the rest
of your life will look like.

11:55.537 --> 11:57.997
See you tomorrow.

11:59.465 --> 12:00.948
He painted the mines?

12:03.088 --> 12:05.095
What are they mining?
Skulls?

12:05.180 --> 12:08.072
- He didn't finish painting that guy.
- Oh, yes, he did.

12:08.281 --> 12:09.720
Over there.

12:10.407 --> 12:12.674
Hmm, he's got talent.

12:15.463 --> 12:19.213
Closed. Unless you got
tickets or a bribe.

12:19.299 --> 12:21.330
Oh, good evening
to you, sir.

12:21.416 --> 12:24.291
We just need to talk
to Mr. Goodberry.

12:24.832 --> 12:28.684
No tickets, no bribe, no deal.

12:28.792 --> 12:30.609
We need to talk
to Mr. Goodberry.

12:30.718 --> 12:33.588
You're in our way.
So get out of it.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.826
- Huh? Oh!
- Huh? Oh!

12:35.911 --> 12:38.658
Whoa, whoa.
Guys, guys, guys.

12:38.744 --> 12:43.064
I don't want to have to pull
out my frying pan, but I will.

12:43.251 --> 12:46.439
Uh, did she say a frying pan?

12:46.525 --> 12:49.431
- Oh yeah. You heard her right.
- Get 'em!

12:50.902 --> 12:52.377
Pascal?

12:53.909 --> 12:56.431
I can't see!
Get this thing off of me!

13:04.740 --> 13:05.740
Hey!

13:08.942 --> 13:10.942
Do you two have any promoters?

13:11.763 --> 13:13.568
Look, not every day
do you meet fighters

13:13.654 --> 13:15.428
who can drop a couple guards
like bad habits.

13:15.514 --> 13:16.652
Look, name's Goodberry.

13:16.738 --> 13:19.403
Virtuous St. Goodberry.
That's right. Walk with me.

13:19.496 --> 13:22.839
Now the best fighters in the world
travel sea and land to come here.

13:22.924 --> 13:24.903
At the grandeur of
the Goodberry Games!

13:34.449 --> 13:38.034
Uh, look, Mr. Goodberry,
we are not here to fight.

13:38.316 --> 13:40.857
We understand that you
have the Eye of Pincosta

13:40.942 --> 13:43.360
and we need to return it
to its rightful owners.

13:43.445 --> 13:46.063
Or a friend of ours
is going to be in big trouble.

13:46.148 --> 13:47.449
A friend of hers.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.957
Right.

13:49.490 --> 13:51.895
So, uh, you mean this, huh?

13:52.020 --> 13:55.223
It's pretty, isn't it?
It's big.

13:55.683 --> 13:57.017
But you know what it ain't?

13:57.199 --> 13:58.241
Yours.

13:58.326 --> 14:00.243
Now if you're not here
to battle, scram!

14:00.328 --> 14:01.845
I've got fighters
to tend to.

14:01.930 --> 14:03.824
They are the meanest,
the toughest,

14:03.910 --> 14:05.661
the coolest,
the strongest,

14:05.747 --> 14:09.113
the never-givin'-upin'-est people
you've ever seen in your life!

14:09.199 --> 14:10.238
We quit!

14:10.324 --> 14:11.354
What?

14:11.439 --> 14:12.871
No, no, no, no, no!

14:12.957 --> 14:14.793
I won't hear of it.
Big fight's tonight!

14:14.879 --> 14:17.332
We're not going up
against Malice Marauder.

14:17.512 --> 14:18.895
We've got families.

14:19.449 --> 14:21.732
Well doesn't that just put
a crimp in my cards?

14:21.817 --> 14:23.233
My main event is history!

14:23.318 --> 14:26.036
I'm ruined!
Kaput! Financial disaster.

14:26.121 --> 14:30.440
I'm going to lose my tents, my carts,
my chairs, my good name... everything!

14:30.525 --> 14:33.176
What if we fight
your challenger?

14:33.261 --> 14:35.545
- What? - What?
- Yeah, that's right.

14:35.630 --> 14:37.817
We'll fight in the main event
and if we win,

14:37.903 --> 14:40.832
you give us
the Eye of Pincosta.

14:41.669 --> 14:46.410
"Malice Marauder versus
the Maidens of Mayhem."

14:46.496 --> 14:47.590
Ha ha!

14:47.676 --> 14:49.395
You know something?
It's a deal.

14:49.481 --> 14:51.293
Okay, see you tonight.

14:51.379 --> 14:53.121
Hoo-hoo!
Going to be a great show!

14:53.207 --> 14:54.902
It'll be the fight
of the century...

14:58.153 --> 15:00.168
 We have no chance
of beating Marauder.

15:00.254 --> 15:02.239
Even if we're better
fighters, which we're not,

15:02.324 --> 15:04.474
Goodberry will rig the game
so we lose.

15:04.559 --> 15:05.863
You know that, right?

15:10.031 --> 15:12.442
We'll have to take Goodberry
at his word.

15:12.567 --> 15:15.231
Oh, you have so much to learn
about the world, Princess.

15:15.317 --> 15:17.770
Just because I hope
for the best from people,

15:17.863 --> 15:19.637
doesn't make me naive.

15:19.723 --> 15:21.520
Yeah, about that...

15:22.823 --> 15:23.871
Hey!

15:23.957 --> 15:25.137
What?

15:26.381 --> 15:28.715
Sorry I can't stick around
for the fight.

15:28.801 --> 15:32.687
I think Goodberry's gonna be
sore when he find this missing.

15:32.773 --> 15:34.145
Your froggy.

15:34.231 --> 15:36.006
You're going to free Eugene

15:36.091 --> 15:37.741
and try to win him back,
aren't you?

15:37.826 --> 15:39.902
A thief belongs with a thief.

15:39.988 --> 15:43.129
I told you you were a bad
judge of character, Princess.

15:45.301 --> 15:47.201
Sorry, Pascal.

15:52.073 --> 15:54.024
Malice, Malice!
Fight, fight, fight!

15:54.109 --> 15:57.840
Malice, Malice!
Fight, fight, fight!

15:57.926 --> 16:00.098
Ladies and gentlemen!

16:00.270 --> 16:03.504
Welcome to the Goodberry Games!

16:03.801 --> 16:05.956
That's right. Are you
ready for a knock-down,

16:06.042 --> 16:07.596
lock-down match of the millennium?

16:08.815 --> 16:10.080
Well, here we go!

16:10.166 --> 16:13.799
She's from far away
but eager to join the fray.

16:13.885 --> 16:15.535
It's the princess
with the punches,

16:15.655 --> 16:18.354
the Maiden of Mayhem!

16:42.962 --> 16:45.285
And our champion
needs no introduction:

16:45.371 --> 16:48.322
Shes brings the might,
she brings the bite,

16:48.408 --> 16:50.535
and she'll
bring the smite.

16:50.675 --> 16:54.425
Give it up
for Malice Marauder!

16:57.572 --> 16:59.305
Oh boy.

17:05.699 --> 17:07.127
That's Malice?

17:07.236 --> 17:08.941
All right, this isn't so bad.

17:18.002 --> 17:19.118
Hey, hey! Easy!

17:19.228 --> 17:20.606
Look, lady, put me down.

17:20.692 --> 17:24.964
- Um, I think we're in trouble, Pascal.
- Okay, you want your money don't you?

17:37.212 --> 17:39.301
<i>Stalyan. It's Rapunzel.</i>

17:39.395 --> 17:40.629
<i>If you're
reading this note,</i>

17:40.715 --> 17:42.632
<i>it means you probably
betrayed me.</i>

17:42.717 --> 17:44.239
<i> But remember,</i>

17:44.325 --> 17:47.348
<i>there is good in everybody.
Even you.</i>

17:47.475 --> 17:52.311
<i>And I hope you will make the right
decision in the end. Rapunzel.</i>

17:54.579 --> 17:56.481
Let the games begin!

18:19.421 --> 18:20.421
Ha! Oh!

18:37.693 --> 18:38.755
Phew.

18:38.841 --> 18:42.120
I've got you right
where I want you.

18:42.277 --> 18:45.912
Just wait until my
second wind kicks in.

19:09.871 --> 19:14.290
Miss Brighty-bright,
here comes the nighty-night!

19:14.375 --> 19:15.692
Hey, Malice!

19:15.777 --> 19:16.893
Huh?

19:16.978 --> 19:18.799
Mind if I cut in?

19:20.675 --> 19:22.799
Looks like you owe her
a frying pan.

19:22.971 --> 19:24.877
Stalyan!

19:38.594 --> 19:40.178
Hey, what are you doing?
Not my chair!

19:40.435 --> 19:42.352
Hey! That's my good chair!

19:42.437 --> 19:43.909
Give me my good chair back!

19:51.380 --> 19:52.930
No, not my table!

19:53.054 --> 19:55.229
Hey, come back with my table!

19:55.968 --> 19:58.245
 What is it
with her and furniture?

20:08.463 --> 20:09.579
Brings back memories.

20:09.664 --> 20:11.347
On three this time.

20:11.432 --> 20:12.615
Count it, blondie.

20:14.636 --> 20:17.503
One, two, jump!

20:29.050 --> 20:30.700
I don't believe it.

20:30.785 --> 20:33.280
You are all witnessing
history, everybody!

20:33.366 --> 20:34.983
I present the new champions.

20:35.069 --> 20:37.987
The gals with gall,
the sisters who can twister,

20:38.073 --> 20:41.625
the sweeties who bring the
heat-ies, give it up for...

20:41.796 --> 20:42.975
We'll be keeping the Eye.

20:43.061 --> 20:47.889
And your horses. And by keep
I mean borrow. If that's okay.

20:52.047 --> 20:54.569
You know, now I get
why he went for you.

20:54.655 --> 20:55.871
Eugene?

20:55.957 --> 20:58.288
I looked at him
and I saw a thief.

20:58.374 --> 21:01.124
And you looked at him
and saw a good person,

21:01.217 --> 21:04.006
which made him
want to be a good person.

21:04.092 --> 21:07.624
And it worked on me too.

21:09.567 --> 21:12.077
Tell Eugene I said hi.

21:12.163 --> 21:16.381
Wait. You're not going to come
and get your payment?

21:23.534 --> 21:26.881
You really lucked out
with this one, Rider.

21:26.967 --> 21:27.991
Oh, I know.

21:28.077 --> 21:29.335
To the vault, men!

21:30.210 --> 21:31.795
Watch your grip, Lewis!

21:31.881 --> 21:33.327
You know I'm ticklish.

21:33.514 --> 21:35.448
I'm sorry you had to deal
with Stalyan.

21:35.534 --> 21:37.327
She's not that bad.

21:37.506 --> 21:40.869
She didn't even take
the payment I offered.

21:40.955 --> 21:42.717
Wait. Where's my key?

21:44.213 --> 21:45.880
We've been robbed!

21:52.940 --> 21:54.741
 <i>You guys are
a really good match,</i>

21:54.827 --> 21:56.151
<i>and I'm not gonna say</i>

21:56.237 --> 21:58.264
<i>that that's easy
for me to deal with.</i>

22:00.066 --> 22:01.491
Heeyah!

22:01.625 --> 22:03.178
<i>But the gold will help.</i>
