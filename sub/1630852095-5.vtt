WEBVTT

00:01.833 --> 00:03.416
YELENA: It's a synthetic gas.

00:03.500 --> 00:05.500
The counteragent to chemical subjugation.

00:07.875 --> 00:10.041
ROMANOFF: He had Widows
implanted all over the world.

00:10.125 --> 00:11.958
You should be the one
to tell 'em it's over.

00:36.625 --> 00:37.833
Hi there, Ana.

00:51.083 --> 00:52.083
Do it.

01:07.333 --> 01:09.083
Stop. I'm trying to help you.

01:09.166 --> 01:11.041
Then why'd you break into my house?

01:11.125 --> 01:12.875
-What?
-Sonya, hold her hands.

01:12.958 --> 01:14.541
SONYA: Hurry. Hit her with the antidote.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.125
Okay.

01:22.416 --> 01:26.083
YELENA: The next bit is gonna be
really scary, but we're here to help you.

01:30.375 --> 01:32.125
Look what you did to my rug.

01:32.208 --> 01:34.416
Twenty thousand dollars down the drain.
Thanks.

01:34.500 --> 01:35.708
Excuse me?

01:35.791 --> 01:37.416
SONYA: I don't think she was brainwashed.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.916
What? You thought
I was some rich pervert's prisoner?

01:43.333 --> 01:44.958
Well, yeah, kind of.

01:45.041 --> 01:48.958
Wait, this is your house?
How can you afford all of this?

01:51.000 --> 01:55.041
By doing the thing we're all best at.
Killing for money.

01:56.666 --> 01:58.500
So, how many widows have you helped?

02:00.458 --> 02:03.166
Many. Many.

02:03.666 --> 02:05.458
Yeah, it's hard work.

02:05.541 --> 02:08.208
It's hard finding them. It's...

02:09.541 --> 02:11.208
It's hard watching them wake.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.083
But it's so worth it.

02:15.166 --> 02:17.458
And when we've
cleared up all of this mess,

02:18.708 --> 02:21.041
we will make good lives for ourselves.

02:21.125 --> 02:23.583
Yelena, how is your sister doing?

02:25.083 --> 02:26.375
She's doing okay.

02:26.458 --> 02:27.958
-ANA: Good.
-Yeah, she's good.

02:28.041 --> 02:30.291
And then, you and Natasha will be reunited

02:30.375 --> 02:33.583
and go live your Sex and the City fantasy
in New York.

02:34.750 --> 02:35.750
Excuse me.

02:35.833 --> 02:37.791
ANA: Sex and the City,
we should watch it together.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.833
What's happening? What's going on?

03:31.916 --> 03:34.458
-MAN: Uh, who are you?
-Who are you?

03:38.375 --> 03:43.125
Yelena? Oh, my God, you're back.

03:43.833 --> 03:44.958
Who's that, Mommy?

03:46.416 --> 03:49.083
It's okay, sweetie. She's an old friend.

03:59.083 --> 04:00.708
ANA: I got married.

04:00.791 --> 04:03.166
We adopted three years ago,
it's been amazing.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.041
-Sonya, who left my house

04:05.125 --> 04:07.458
in a much less dramatic fashion
than you did that day,

04:07.541 --> 04:09.583
realized this and now you will too.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.416
You can start with contract work.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.583
And then you can stay here
as long as you need.

04:14.666 --> 04:15.750
Okay, stop.

04:15.833 --> 04:18.000
Ana, I was in there for five seconds,

04:18.083 --> 04:21.000
I come out and I've lost five years
of my life. Please.

04:21.083 --> 04:23.750
I'm sorry, Yelena.
I was just trying to help you.

04:24.583 --> 04:26.500
I know, I... Thank you. Yeah.

04:31.416 --> 04:33.125
I need to find Natasha.

04:34.125 --> 04:38.125
Can you help me find Natasha?
I need to tell her I'm okay.

05:23.375 --> 05:25.375
I cannot lose Kate.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.625
I've lost people before.

05:26.708 --> 05:28.708
I know in your line of work,
you have, too.

05:28.791 --> 05:30.083
I understand.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.166
Sloan's a shell company
that launders money for the Tracksuits.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.458
And Jack Duquesne is the CEO.

05:37.541 --> 05:40.291
KATE: You lost your family in the Blip?
BARTON: Yeah.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.833
Is that where you met the Ronin?
It's you, isn't it?

05:42.916 --> 05:44.750
Everybody dealt with the Blip
in their own way.

05:44.833 --> 05:45.833
What do you want?

05:45.916 --> 05:47.333
I don't want anybody else to die.

05:47.416 --> 05:49.916
But Maya's need for vengeance
is gonna get her killed.

05:58.083 --> 06:00.750
Someone has hired a Black Widow assassin.

06:00.833 --> 06:03.916
This has gotten very real, very quickly.
So I'm doing this alone.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.166
I chose to be here.

06:05.250 --> 06:07.958
I understand the risk,
I understand all of that.

06:08.041 --> 06:09.375
I'm not gonna do it.

06:09.458 --> 06:11.791
Go home, Kate. It's over.

06:28.291 --> 06:29.291
ELEANOR: Kate?

06:33.291 --> 06:34.541
Are you okay?

06:35.125 --> 06:37.416
And why are you wearing your archery suit?

06:37.500 --> 06:38.875
I'm okay.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.416
Does this have to do with Clint Barton?

06:41.500 --> 06:44.000
Mom, no. Clint protected me.

06:46.416 --> 06:48.708
You'll be glad to know
he then told me to come home

06:48.791 --> 06:50.166
and stay away from him.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.250
Mm.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.958
Look at me.

06:58.041 --> 07:00.458
You're the only thing that matters to me.

07:00.541 --> 07:02.375
Are you sure you're okay?

07:06.083 --> 07:08.250
Oh. Come here. Come here.

07:09.416 --> 07:12.125
Oh. My baby girl.

07:12.208 --> 07:14.625
-It's okay, hon.

07:26.875 --> 07:29.916
Does Clint think you're a superhero?

07:32.375 --> 07:33.375
No.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.291
I don't either.

07:46.833 --> 07:50.208
Mm. I know it's scary now, Kate.

07:50.291 --> 07:53.250
But this doesn't
have to change who you are.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.416
It just means that what you do

07:55.500 --> 07:58.291
might look a little different
than you dreamed of as a child.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.083
And preferably a little less reckless.

08:01.166 --> 08:03.458
I never wanted to be reckless.
I wanted to help you.

08:03.541 --> 08:04.833
I know, hon.

08:04.916 --> 08:07.583
Recklessness is
the unfortunate side effect.

08:16.333 --> 08:18.833
Bet you regret buying me
that first bow, don't you?

08:18.916 --> 08:19.958
Sometimes.

08:21.916 --> 08:22.916
Kidding.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.708
You were so cute with that tiny bow.

08:32.416 --> 08:34.291
God, I thought I could do anything.

08:39.125 --> 08:41.333
I really thought I could be one of them.

08:44.916 --> 08:47.000
Don't beat yourself up, hon.

08:47.875 --> 08:50.958
Sometimes the paths we're on,

08:51.041 --> 08:54.208
they wind around in ways
that we never would have expected.

08:54.875 --> 08:57.833
All you can do is keep moving forward,

08:58.791 --> 09:02.625
even on days when honestly,
it all just kind of feels like shit.

09:09.625 --> 09:11.916
Do you ever worry about me
not finding my path?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
No.

09:13.541 --> 09:15.500
I know exactly who you are.

09:17.250 --> 09:21.583
And I have a pretty good picture
of who you're becoming.

09:28.458 --> 09:30.250
I need to tell you something.

09:31.125 --> 09:34.333
Clint and I have been
looking into Armand's murder.

09:35.458 --> 09:39.416
And we found a lot of incriminating stuff
about Jack, Mom.

09:40.666 --> 09:45.125
Including this Shell company that he has,
called Sloan Limited.

09:45.791 --> 09:48.625
Maybe there's a reason for all...

09:48.708 --> 09:51.500
I don't know.
But you have to please just promise me

09:51.583 --> 09:53.750
that you'll look into it.
That's all I ask.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.875
Okay. Okay, I will.

09:58.250 --> 10:01.416
You go get your things and come back home.

10:15.708 --> 10:16.708
Hey.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.416
Come on.

10:44.416 --> 10:45.500
Must stop.

11:00.166 --> 11:01.166
Okay?

11:09.916 --> 11:11.333
Oh, my God.

11:34.833 --> 11:35.916
Kate Bishop.

11:39.333 --> 11:40.541
Hi.

11:41.916 --> 11:43.666
I made macaroni if you want some.

11:45.750 --> 11:47.208
I'm sorry. What?

11:47.291 --> 11:49.625
Well, I was starving and you took forever.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.666
So I wanted to make food.

11:55.708 --> 11:56.708
What do you want?

11:56.791 --> 12:00.291
Relax, Kate Bishop.
I just want to talk, okay?

12:01.791 --> 12:03.375
Are you really not hungry?

12:03.458 --> 12:05.916
That fight was so long.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.875
It's really tasty. Really tasty.

12:09.166 --> 12:11.125
I know what boxed mac and cheese
tastes like.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.583
I know it's... It's delicious.

12:12.666 --> 12:15.333
Forks. Forks.

12:16.333 --> 12:17.583
No.

12:19.625 --> 12:20.916
You have one fork?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.333
-I'm one person.
-That's so weird.

12:23.875 --> 12:27.750
Kate, this is not cutlery.
This is not cutlery.

12:27.833 --> 12:29.625
I am not gonna have dinner with you

12:29.708 --> 12:32.125
after you tried to kill me
and then broke into my house.

12:32.208 --> 12:33.500
I did not try to kill you.

12:33.583 --> 12:36.750
A, I put you on a wire
to remove an obstacle.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.958
And B, I did not break anything.

12:39.041 --> 12:40.625
I am way too talented than that.

12:40.708 --> 12:45.000
And C, stop being so defensive. Okay?

12:45.083 --> 12:46.333
You're so hostile.

12:46.416 --> 12:49.208
I'm not going to hurt you. I promise.

12:49.958 --> 12:51.750
I don't have any weapons on me.

12:52.666 --> 12:54.166
Okay, I take that back.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.666
I don't have any weapons
currently in my hands.

13:02.625 --> 13:04.208
That's a lie also.

13:04.291 --> 13:07.250
Come on, take a fork. Eat. Eat.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.333
Please, my daddy says it's good for you.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.666
You're probably thinking,

13:13.750 --> 13:16.750
"What? This is crazy.

13:17.750 --> 13:20.500
"I'm going to have dinner with the enemy?

13:20.583 --> 13:24.250
"And she made
some really good smelling macaroni."

13:25.083 --> 13:27.500
But in all honesty,
if I wanted to kill you--

13:27.583 --> 13:28.791
You would have already.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.166
Right as you open the door.

13:30.250 --> 13:32.291
-I probably wouldn't have time to shut it.
-No.

13:32.375 --> 13:34.000
-I'd have been dead. Okay.
-No.

13:35.708 --> 13:36.708
Yeah.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.333
GRILLS: Hello?

13:53.416 --> 13:56.041
Hey, Grills, it's Clint. Can I come up?

13:56.125 --> 13:58.541
Oh, my God, yeah, yeah, come up.

14:04.583 --> 14:07.083
-GRILLS: I've been thinkin' about a name--

14:07.166 --> 14:08.958
-Hey.
-GRILLS: Oh.

14:10.291 --> 14:11.666
Can I come in?

14:12.916 --> 14:14.250
Yeah, come on.

14:24.958 --> 14:27.041
-Are you done?
-Yeah.

14:27.125 --> 14:29.166
-I go?
-Sure, can.

14:29.250 --> 14:31.125
-I could put hot sauce on it?
-Hmm.

14:32.166 --> 14:33.958
Ah, I love hot sauce.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.708
Yes.

14:38.375 --> 14:40.000
So what do you want?

14:40.833 --> 14:45.416
Well, it's my first time in New York.
Mmm-hmm.

14:46.166 --> 14:48.041
It's a business trip, so time is limited.

14:48.125 --> 14:49.541
But I want to see some things.

14:49.625 --> 14:53.041
I want to see, uh,
the Empire State Building,

14:53.750 --> 14:58.708
the new and improved Statue of Liberty,
and the Rockefeller Center.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.041
Very funny.

15:01.583 --> 15:02.708
What, it's not good?

15:04.000 --> 15:06.541
Oh. No, they're-they're great.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.791
Yeah, you...
I mean, you've gotta see the tree.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.208
Mmm.

15:10.291 --> 15:13.625
Exactly. See? I love American Christmases.

15:13.708 --> 15:19.000
The tree, the presents,
the super-powered reindeer, Rudolph.

15:19.083 --> 15:22.208
-Mmm-hmm. Rudolph. Heh.
-He is so weird.

15:22.291 --> 15:23.958
Have you ever eaten reindeer?

15:25.291 --> 15:28.833
-Cannot say I've had the pleasure. No.
-It's...

15:31.375 --> 15:35.541
No, it's, um, it's really tough.
It's chewy.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.500
Mm, you have to braise it
for a really long time.

15:38.583 --> 15:41.541
But, hey, Kate Bishop,
you grew up here, right?

15:43.125 --> 15:45.791
You must have some recommendations for me.

15:48.250 --> 15:51.333
Yeah, I-I have. Let's see.
The High Line. High Line is great. Um...

15:51.416 --> 15:54.791
There's a Christmas market
in Union Square. Um...

15:56.375 --> 16:00.583
I'm not quite sure those are the right fit
for the blood-thirsty vigilante type.

16:05.875 --> 16:07.458
Sometimes you're funny, Kate Bishop.

16:07.541 --> 16:09.958
Do you say my whole name
to point out that you know it?

16:10.458 --> 16:13.375
Yes. I know a lot about you.

16:14.958 --> 16:18.333
Mother, Eleanor. Lives on Park and 41st.

16:18.416 --> 16:20.708
Father, Derek, deceased. Very sad.

16:21.375 --> 16:23.708
And you recently walked into traffic
to save a dog,

16:23.791 --> 16:26.000
which I'll admit is pretty cool,

16:26.083 --> 16:28.916
and you got a few points
from me on that. Um...

16:29.000 --> 16:32.291
University GPA 3.8.
Senior, double major, and--

16:32.375 --> 16:33.416
Right, okay. We get it.

16:35.625 --> 16:36.625
Thank you.

16:38.750 --> 16:41.458
Are you in New York to talk to Clint?
Is that why you're here?

16:41.541 --> 16:43.750
No. No, no, no.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.541
I'm here to kill him.

16:52.541 --> 16:54.250
I have a question for you.

16:55.833 --> 16:56.916
What is it?

16:57.000 --> 17:00.666
Why do you risk your life
for him, Clint Barton?

17:02.000 --> 17:05.083
How has everybody
forgiven him for his past?

17:06.541 --> 17:08.125
He saved the world.

17:08.708 --> 17:12.416
No. My sister saved the world.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.375
Natasha Romanoff, she saved the world.

17:18.583 --> 17:22.125
Stop pretending like you're not surprised.
It does not look cool.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.166
You're really Natasha's sister?

17:26.333 --> 17:27.333
Yes.

17:27.416 --> 17:30.375
Wow. I did not see that coming.
Thank God, I didn't kill you up there.

17:34.791 --> 17:36.083
You kill me?

17:36.166 --> 17:40.083
Again, oh, Kate Bishop, you are so funny.

17:40.166 --> 17:42.583
That's hilarious.
That one is the funniest.

17:44.333 --> 17:47.458
Natasha and Clint were friends.
Why are you after him?

17:48.958 --> 17:50.875
You are so fond of him.

17:53.791 --> 17:56.416
It tells me
you don't really know who he is.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.708
He came out here to protect me.

17:59.291 --> 18:03.250
No. He came here
to protect his reputation.

18:05.416 --> 18:07.833
Do you know how many people he killed?

18:09.791 --> 18:15.416
The trail of blood that follows him,
it could wrap around the entire world.

18:15.500 --> 18:19.416
Okay. Wow. That was very Russian.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.708
YELENA: Hmm.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.625
He's still an Avenger.

18:22.708 --> 18:25.291
What does that word even mean? Huh?

18:26.125 --> 18:28.250
That it holds so much power.

18:29.666 --> 18:32.250
You call him a hero
no matter what he does?

18:32.833 --> 18:36.041
It means that when you choose
to spend your life trying to help people,

18:36.125 --> 18:38.625
there are going to be things
that you lose.

18:38.708 --> 18:40.666
When you face
the kind of threats that he has,

18:40.750 --> 18:42.458
there's going to be collateral damage.

18:42.541 --> 18:46.791
My sister is gone because of him.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.000
What? No. No, that is... No.

18:51.083 --> 18:52.375
She's gone.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.208
Is she collateral damage?

19:00.375 --> 19:02.750
No, look, there is no way
that that is true.

19:02.833 --> 19:04.541
He would not let that happen.

19:04.625 --> 19:07.125
How long have you known Clint Barton?

19:11.958 --> 19:13.083
About a week.

19:16.250 --> 19:19.791
It will not be difficult
for me to complete this assignment.

19:22.375 --> 19:25.250
Wait a minute,
somebody hired you to kill him?

19:32.500 --> 19:34.666
All I'll say is that
if there is someone out there

19:34.750 --> 19:36.541
that is telling you Clint is a bad guy,

19:36.625 --> 19:39.916
then maybe you should ask yourself
what kind of person hired you.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.875
He is not perfect.
Nobody's perfect. But he is good.

19:51.541 --> 19:56.083
However he convinced you about who he is

19:57.250 --> 20:00.541
or how many people think
or call him a hero,

20:02.333 --> 20:04.000
truth is it doesn't matter.

20:04.916 --> 20:07.833
We are defined by what we do.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.916
Not by nice words.

20:12.375 --> 20:15.166
Like it or not, there is no escaping this.

20:23.958 --> 20:24.958
So...

20:27.958 --> 20:29.083
Where is he?

20:30.958 --> 20:32.041
I don't know.

20:38.583 --> 20:39.583
Okay.

20:45.625 --> 20:48.958
Thank you for the girls' night, truly.

21:01.208 --> 21:06.625
Oh. And, Kate Bishop,
do not get in my way again.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.708
BARTON: Well, I really appreciate it,
thank you.

21:26.791 --> 21:27.791
GRILLS: No problem.

21:27.875 --> 21:29.791
Since there was this... This guy.

21:29.875 --> 21:31.541
GRILLS: Come on, man, of course.

21:31.625 --> 21:36.916
You think you could, um, look after
the dog just for a few more days?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
GRILLS: Sure.

21:38.083 --> 21:39.791
I, I got a hotel, and they don't have--

21:39.875 --> 21:42.375
-They don't allow dogs.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.291
-Hotel?
-Yeah, it's just, uh...

21:45.375 --> 21:46.375
No way.

21:46.458 --> 21:48.750
Hawkeye's gonna stay in a hotel
for Christmas?

21:48.833 --> 21:52.583
Man, take my couch. Really, take my bed.

21:52.666 --> 21:54.583
The-The-The couch will be great,
thank you.

21:54.666 --> 21:55.750
Here, bud.

21:57.333 --> 21:58.708
Almost forgot.

21:58.791 --> 22:02.083
Missy dropped off the new outfits
for you and Kate. You wanna see 'em?

22:02.666 --> 22:06.958
Just not right now.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.041
OFFICER: We're gonna need you
to come in and answer some questions.

22:24.125 --> 22:27.250
I promise you
this is all a big misunderstanding.

22:27.333 --> 22:29.500
I've never worked a day in my life.

22:29.583 --> 22:31.750
We have some tax records
that will beg to differ.

22:31.833 --> 22:34.083
I'm telling you,
the only Sloan I've ever known

22:34.166 --> 22:37.833
was this woman I dated in Palm Beach
and she was an absolute nightmare.

22:38.666 --> 22:39.750
I'm so sorry, Mom.

22:39.833 --> 22:41.708
ELEANOR: I looked into it, honey,
and you were right.

22:41.791 --> 22:43.625
I don't blame you for calling the police.

22:43.708 --> 22:46.000
I would have done exactly the same thing.

22:46.083 --> 22:48.291
I've obviously been framed.

22:48.375 --> 22:49.583
I'll clear all this up

22:49.666 --> 22:52.833
and be back in a jiffy
for your Christmas party, you'll see.

22:59.041 --> 23:01.291
ON THIS SITE IN 2012
DURING THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK,

23:01.375 --> 23:03.000
THE AVENGERS FIRST ASSEMBLED.

23:20.750 --> 23:21.750
Natasha...

23:24.791 --> 23:26.708
I really need to talk to you right now.

23:28.666 --> 23:31.583
You were the bravest of us all,
weren't you?

23:31.666 --> 23:33.958
Loyal, stubborn.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.375
You always had to win, didn't you?

23:40.375 --> 23:42.125
And for a stupid orange rock.

23:45.333 --> 23:49.416
I replayed that a million times in my head
hoping for a different outcome.

23:56.625 --> 23:59.666
But I do my best every day
to earn what you gave me.

24:02.291 --> 24:03.666
Just wanna say I'm...

24:07.666 --> 24:09.125
Just wanna say I miss you.

24:11.916 --> 24:14.750
And I'm so sorry for what I'm about to do.

25:15.875 --> 25:18.416
Hey, it's me. Um...

25:19.291 --> 25:23.500
Listen, I know you said, "It's over,"
but it's not.

25:24.375 --> 25:25.583
Not for me.

25:25.666 --> 25:26.708
-Call me back.
-

25:26.791 --> 25:29.041
We need to talk about
the other woman on the roof.

25:29.125 --> 25:30.333
Not Maya, no, the other one.

25:30.416 --> 25:32.666
I don't wanna say much on the phone.
Call me back.

25:32.750 --> 25:38.333
So, the police arrested Jack,
which is all pretty crazy.

25:38.416 --> 25:40.500
-Would be great to discuss.
-

25:40.583 --> 25:43.458
Yeah, okay, sure,
I've screwed up a few times.

25:43.541 --> 25:46.583
whatever, I'm still learning.

25:46.666 --> 25:48.250
-Oh, shit.

25:48.333 --> 25:50.208
Do you think I wanna do this, Clint?

25:50.291 --> 25:52.958
You think I wanna leave these messages
like a crazy person?

25:53.041 --> 25:54.958
-No, this is your fault.
-

25:55.041 --> 25:58.500
This isn't over, Barton.
I'm gonna find you.

25:58.583 --> 26:01.708
The mailbox is full and cannot accept
any messages at this time.

26:10.791 --> 26:13.500
-

26:13.583 --> 26:16.375
-Run-DMC's classic tracksuit.
-Classic. Classic.

26:16.458 --> 26:18.833
Or, uh, Tommie Smith in Olympics

26:18.916 --> 26:21.333
or Royal Tenenbaums, right?

26:21.416 --> 26:23.208
Tony Soprano, "Forget about it".

26:23.291 --> 26:27.500
Royal Tenenbaums? Come on.
Do we look like Royal Tenenbaums?

26:28.500 --> 26:29.500
Yes.

26:31.833 --> 26:33.375
MAN 1: You know what
you don't see anymore?

26:33.458 --> 26:35.041
MAN 2: Tell me.
MAN 1: Brass knuckles.

26:35.125 --> 26:36.625
MAN 2: What are we gonna do, huh?

26:36.708 --> 26:38.916
Pull them out of your pocket
in middle of fight?

26:39.000 --> 26:40.208
"Wait one second please.

26:40.291 --> 26:42.583
"Let me put on brass knuckle
to punch your face."

26:59.666 --> 27:03.250
MAN 2: "Maya, meet me tonight
where you first met the Ronin.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
"Alone."

27:05.583 --> 27:07.291
But we are not Maya.

27:22.833 --> 27:26.458
Hey. Perfect timing.
I just put Nate down to bed.

27:26.708 --> 27:28.791
BARTON: Yeah, good. We need to talk.

27:28.875 --> 27:32.625
Uh-oh, no fun conversation's
ever started that way.

27:33.791 --> 27:34.791
Yeah.

27:37.541 --> 27:42.166
Look, I... I'm sorry,
this problem just keeps getting bigger.

27:42.833 --> 27:45.291
This Maya is relentless.

27:45.875 --> 27:49.833
She's got her hands on the watch.
She looked into our family.

27:49.916 --> 27:52.083
Someone has hired a black widow.

27:53.375 --> 27:57.250
And I... I don't wanna
think about where this all goes.

27:57.333 --> 28:02.166
Clint, we've been so careful, really. I...
I mean, the kids and I are so far away.

28:02.250 --> 28:05.208
It's not far enough.
It's never far enough.

28:07.375 --> 28:09.541
If I don't end this tonight, um,

28:10.625 --> 28:13.291
it's just a matter of time
before the big guy gets involved.

28:13.375 --> 28:16.250
Jesus. Are you sure?

28:17.041 --> 28:19.416
Can't be sure.
It's just a sinking feeling.

28:22.541 --> 28:24.291
Then follow your gut.

28:26.708 --> 28:29.083
What? It's not what you wanted to hear?

28:31.625 --> 28:32.833
Yeah, no.

28:34.500 --> 28:37.208
Listen, you didn't call
looking for permission

28:37.291 --> 28:39.250
and you don't need it from me so...

28:40.958 --> 28:42.791
I trust your judgement.

28:43.958 --> 28:45.500
You do what you have to do.

28:48.041 --> 28:49.041
Okay.

28:50.291 --> 28:51.833
LAURA: And know that
I'll always understand

28:51.916 --> 28:53.791
more than anybody else ever could.

28:55.166 --> 28:56.333
BARTON: I love you.

28:57.291 --> 28:59.166
LAURA: I love you. Go end this.

30:06.791 --> 30:07.916
Aah!

32:13.250 --> 32:14.291
I wanted you...

32:23.458 --> 32:24.666
No.

32:25.833 --> 32:30.958
But if you or anyone
comes after me or my family,

32:33.958 --> 32:37.291
it will be the last thing you do.
You have my word.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.166
You and I, we're the same.

32:48.625 --> 32:49.916
We're weapons.

32:51.208 --> 32:53.708
But when you're filled with rage,
it makes you blind.

32:56.125 --> 32:59.958
It could be used, could be manipulated.

33:03.666 --> 33:06.375
Trust me, I know.

33:20.083 --> 33:23.541
Yes. Your boss.

33:26.750 --> 33:30.166
Your boss wanted your father dead.
Now he's using you--

33:30.500 --> 33:33.208
-

33:59.041 --> 34:01.458
KATE: I bet you're wondering
how I found you.

34:01.541 --> 34:04.166
-You tracked my phone again, didn't you?
-KATE: Yeah.

34:04.250 --> 34:06.375
So this rescue mission,
you got an escape plan?

34:07.083 --> 34:09.458
-Hey, are you Tabitha?
-Yes.

34:09.541 --> 34:10.916
DRIVER: All right. Hop on in.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.208
Thank God.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.416
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

34:40.125 --> 34:41.250
So...

34:47.875 --> 34:50.750
That's it? He got away.

34:54.375 --> 34:55.916
God damn it.

35:05.416 --> 35:07.041
What are you talking about?

35:15.458 --> 35:19.541
I don't know. I didn't get the call.

35:27.916 --> 35:29.333
You sure?

36:03.000 --> 36:04.333
Well, there's, uh...

36:07.375 --> 36:09.000
one more thing we should worry about.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.916
Yeah? What's that?

36:11.000 --> 36:14.750
Um... Do you remember the girl
from last night, the one in the mask?

36:14.958 --> 36:17.625
-Uh-huh.
-Um, I spoke to her.

36:18.875 --> 36:19.875
And?

36:23.625 --> 36:25.791
She said she's Natasha's sister.

36:32.041 --> 36:33.041
Yelena?

36:34.458 --> 36:35.458
KATE: Yeah.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Okay.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
BARTON: Okay.

36:59.291 --> 37:00.375
You all right?

37:01.041 --> 37:02.041
Yeah.

37:44.333 --> 37:46.583
GRILLS: Dance. Oh!
KATE: Oh!

37:46.666 --> 37:48.458
-GRILLS: Good job, buddy.
-Wait. I wanna try.

37:48.541 --> 37:50.250
-You're amazing.
-Here, you try it.

37:50.333 --> 37:52.333
-All right. Dance.
-

37:52.416 --> 37:53.541
No, dance.

37:55.291 --> 37:57.125
You made it look so easy and cool.

37:58.541 --> 38:01.375
-Yeah, Grills is cool.

38:01.458 --> 38:04.041
You can cook, you can LARP,
you can put out fires.

38:04.125 --> 38:05.458
Ah. Stop it.

38:07.750 --> 38:08.916
GRILLS: Hmm.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.208
Unknown
Kate Bishop, I found out who hired me.

38:15.291 --> 38:16.291
BARTON: What is it?

38:17.458 --> 38:18.458
Eleanor Bishop

38:18.541 --> 38:19.750
Thought you deserved to know.

38:21.958 --> 38:22.958
BARTON: Kate?

38:25.375 --> 38:28.458
KATE: Look at this.
Who's that with my mom?

38:35.500 --> 38:38.541
Well, that's the guy
I've been worried about this whole time.

38:38.625 --> 38:39.750
Kingpin.
