WEBVTT

00:53.017 --> 00:56.077
[man] It only happens
once a year, and then they die.

00:57.955 --> 01:01.083
It's like a mating ritual or something.

01:01.159 --> 01:03.150
Isn't that romantic?

01:03.228 --> 01:08.291
[chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, it is.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.107
- [woman] Chris!
- Dude, what the fuck?

01:24.185 --> 01:27.120
- [woman 2] That's so not cool.
- [woman 1] God! You scared me.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.621
- Sorry.
- What happened?

01:28.689 --> 01:31.658
- Shit. They're gone.
- You hit a deer or something?

01:31.726 --> 01:33.990
- They're usually right here.
- Sit down.

01:34.062 --> 01:36.963
- The party's that way.
- The party's this way.

01:37.032 --> 01:39.091
- Danny.
- Come on, it's prom night.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.158
- [engine revving]
- [tires screech]

01:41.971 --> 01:44.531
Whoo!

01:47.543 --> 01:48.942
[Danny] Yeah!

01:49.012 --> 01:52.004
Class of '03, kiss my ass!

01:52.082 --> 01:53.481
Now look.

01:57.454 --> 02:00.514
My God. They're so beautiful.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.691
Look, look. You can grab the light.

02:20.814 --> 02:21.838
[screeching]

02:21.915 --> 02:25.146
- Jesus!
- It's not funny.

02:28.156 --> 02:30.681
- You can turn the lights back on.
- Come on.

02:30.758 --> 02:33.283
- They were so beautiful.
- Told you, right?

02:33.361 --> 02:36.819
- Please. You're freaking me out.
- There's more up there.

02:36.899 --> 02:38.093
- Now!
- Hang on.

02:38.167 --> 02:40.658
- Turn on the goddamn lights!
- Chris...

02:40.736 --> 02:42.067
All right.

02:49.078 --> 02:50.636
[alarm beeping]

02:50.713 --> 02:51.702
[Chris] I wake up.

02:56.387 --> 02:58.082
Turn off the alarm.

02:58.889 --> 03:01.756
I look outside
so that I know what to wear.

03:03.795 --> 03:06.286
I take a shower...

03:06.364 --> 03:08.355
... with soap.

03:13.105 --> 03:15.096
And then I shave.

03:18.044 --> 03:20.535
Sometimes I cry for no reason.

03:22.816 --> 03:25.842
But I'm getting a handle on it.

03:25.919 --> 03:27.409
[alarm beeping]

03:27.487 --> 03:28.886
I wake up.

03:30.857 --> 03:32.188
I get dressed.

03:35.496 --> 03:37.964
I take my meds.

03:38.032 --> 03:43.095
When Lewis is gone,
I make the coffee, which can be tricky.

03:44.006 --> 03:46.975
I eat breakfast,
but I don't read the paper.

03:47.042 --> 03:49.010
It confuses me, which makes me mad.

03:52.282 --> 03:54.113
[alarm beeping]

03:54.184 --> 03:56.482
I wake up.

03:59.122 --> 04:02.091
I put on my coat and go to class.

04:09.234 --> 04:10.792
I wake up.

04:16.108 --> 04:19.202
[man] Ten more seconds.

04:19.279 --> 04:22.112
We're just doing one day, OK?
No big deal.

04:27.186 --> 04:29.017
And time.

04:31.125 --> 04:33.355
It's OK, chief. It's not a test.

04:41.102 --> 04:42.694
[honking]

05:06.264 --> 05:08.255
[children laughing]

05:44.106 --> 05:46.597
[beeping]

06:14.005 --> 06:15.996
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.870
That's a nice hug.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.709
Want anything?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.514
[man] Hi.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.786
- What are you having?
- Hot chocolate.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.851
- I'll have that. Thanks.
- OK.

06:37.932 --> 06:40.093
- Any problems this week?
- Nope.

06:40.168 --> 06:42.136
Swearing? Crying?

06:42.203 --> 06:44.569
- Sequencing or memory issues?
- No.

06:44.639 --> 06:46.937
Taking your meds?

06:47.008 --> 06:50.375
- So all's good.
- Why? What's Lewis say?

06:50.446 --> 06:53.882
You're the only one who can talk about
what's going on with you.

06:53.949 --> 06:56.782
Well, in that case, I'm great.

06:56.853 --> 06:58.844
There you go.

06:58.922 --> 07:01.049
- Careful. It's hot.
- I know.

07:06.564 --> 07:08.555
Have you spoken to Mr. Tuttle yet?

07:08.632 --> 07:10.793
- No. I will.
- When?

07:10.868 --> 07:12.859
- You were a model before.
- Chris...

07:12.937 --> 07:17.067
I was just wondering how you go from
being a model to being a case manager.

07:17.142 --> 07:21.602
After my head injury I realized there
were more people in the world than me.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.910
Wanna go to a movie with me sometime?

07:23.982 --> 07:28.112
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Come on. It's just a movie.

07:28.187 --> 07:30.655
We should talk about the women
in your life.

07:30.723 --> 07:34.819
- You mean besides you?
- Yeah. Is there anybody?

07:37.698 --> 07:40.189
Think you should do something
about that?

07:40.267 --> 07:43.236
I think about fucking you all the time.

07:44.072 --> 07:46.438
I don't think they heard that
over by the door.

07:46.508 --> 07:50.808
- I didn't mean it like that. I meant...
- I know what you meant.

07:50.879 --> 07:53.211
Would you have said that
before your injury?

07:53.282 --> 07:56.445
So now you're gonna bring up
the frontal lobe bullshit?

07:56.519 --> 08:00.922
Disinhibition. That might be getting
in the way of your meeting someone.

08:00.990 --> 08:05.359
Asking a stranger for sex isn't
the best way to start a relationship.

08:05.428 --> 08:07.794
- Not a good one.
- You're not a stranger.

08:07.864 --> 08:12.096
- I have a relationship with you.
- I'm paid to work with you.

08:15.239 --> 08:18.333
- Why are you here?
- You tell me.

08:18.409 --> 08:20.707
I know why I'm here.

08:20.779 --> 08:24.579
I'm here to help you get what you want.
What you really want.

08:24.650 --> 08:27.983
But you've gotta know
what that is first.

08:29.221 --> 08:31.712
I just wanna be who I was.

09:07.731 --> 09:09.130
[machine beeps]

09:09.199 --> 09:12.532
[man] Hey, kid, your mom called
to remind you about Thanksgiving.

09:12.603 --> 09:15.401
I told her you had a hooker in your room

09:15.472 --> 09:17.997
but that I'd be sure
to pass on the message.

09:18.076 --> 09:21.910
OK, so the menu for tonight
is spaghetti amatriciana.

09:21.980 --> 09:25.177
That's that pasta that's got
the bacon in it that you like.

09:25.249 --> 09:30.585
The tomatoes are on the counter, so
open up the cans and put them in a pot.

09:58.887 --> 10:01.287
Garlic press, asshole.

10:07.664 --> 10:08.961
[screams]

10:09.032 --> 10:11.023
Fuck!

10:15.272 --> 10:17.968
[man 2] Hello, 1-800-Flowers.

10:18.042 --> 10:22.240
Ma'am, if I can send them to my own
mother, anyone can send them to anybody.

10:22.313 --> 10:26.249
And it just so happens to be
our featured special. Uh-huh.

10:26.317 --> 10:31.186
Let's see. It's got roses and lilies
and snapdragons and fuji mums.

10:31.257 --> 10:36.217
Australiums, which smell awesome,
unlike tulips, which don't smell at all.

10:36.295 --> 10:39.958
[Chris] Lewis, I can't find
the motherfucking can opener!

10:40.032 --> 10:43.490
They should last
about a week or two. That's right.

10:43.570 --> 10:46.596
Terrific. And your name?

10:46.673 --> 10:49.005
Kathy. Is that with a C or a K?

10:49.076 --> 10:52.170
K. Kathy with a K.
That's a beautiful name, Kathy.

11:08.865 --> 11:10.856
Chris?

11:13.169 --> 11:15.933
I don't smell dinner.

11:19.176 --> 11:21.167
Chris?

11:44.070 --> 11:46.061
I'm sorry, Lewis.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.245
- Feel better?
- Yeah, thanks.

11:54.314 --> 11:58.512
Chop some lettuce, cucumber, whatever
else you might want for your salad.

12:00.388 --> 12:03.824
- Let's talk about your afternoon.
- We had to write again.

12:03.892 --> 12:06.952
Oh, yeah? Let me guess.
Topic A, "Why am I all fucked up?"

12:07.029 --> 12:10.487
Or topic B,
"Living with being all fucked up."

12:10.566 --> 12:16.505
Reggie had us list a typical day,
and I kept getting stuck on "I wake up."

12:16.573 --> 12:21.533
- I couldn't think of just a list.
- Well, don't think of it as a list.

12:21.611 --> 12:24.171
Think of it as a story instead.

12:26.050 --> 12:27.711
A story like what?

12:27.785 --> 12:31.118
Like, you know,
"Once upon a time I woke up,

12:31.189 --> 12:34.158
took a piss, beat off in the shower..."

12:34.226 --> 12:37.525
- How is that gonna help me?
- I don't know.

12:37.596 --> 12:40.827
Stories are what help us
make sense of the world.

12:40.899 --> 12:43.629
- I can't tell stories.
- Use one you already know.

12:43.703 --> 12:45.762
OK. How about War and fucking Peace?

12:45.839 --> 12:48.706
That's a story.
I'd start a little simpler, though.

12:48.775 --> 12:51.835
How about Goldilocks
and the Three fucking Bears?

12:51.912 --> 12:53.903
Where's the cucumber?

12:57.351 --> 13:01.014
- Come on. Let's hear it.
- You want me to tell you Goldilocks?

13:01.089 --> 13:03.080
Entertain me.

13:03.158 --> 13:08.562
OK. Once upon a time, there was
a little girl named Goldilocks.

13:08.630 --> 13:10.791
- And then?
- And then...

13:10.867 --> 13:13.836
I don't know, man.
She got eaten by a wolf.

13:13.903 --> 13:16.167
Fucking hit by a truck. This is stupid.

13:16.239 --> 13:21.336
Start at the end. Can't tell a story
if you don't know where it's going.

13:21.411 --> 13:24.539
And lose the wolf.
That's Little Red Riding Hood.

13:27.150 --> 13:30.586
The three bears find Goldilocks
asleep in their beds.

13:30.655 --> 13:33.317
And then, um, she takes off.

13:33.391 --> 13:37.225
Exactly. All right, now, that's the end.
What happened before that?

13:37.295 --> 13:43.200
Um, one goes, "Someone's been sleeping
in my bed, and she's still there."

13:43.269 --> 13:46.432
And before that it was,
"Someone is sitting in my chair."

13:46.505 --> 13:49.497
Yeah, and then the bear kid's chair's
all jacked up.

13:49.576 --> 13:52.602
Then it goes all the way back
to her walking in the door.

13:52.679 --> 13:56.445
- First she walks in the forest.
- You sequence just fine.

13:56.517 --> 14:01.614
You just gotta start at the end,
work backwards. Write that down.

14:40.332 --> 14:43.062
- Hi, Mrs. Lange.
- Hi, Chris.

14:43.135 --> 14:45.262
- He's in a good mood.
- Oh, OK.

14:45.338 --> 14:47.101
- Good night.
- Good night.

14:54.147 --> 14:57.514
The harvest checks go out
in a week or so.

14:57.584 --> 15:01.520
That means we're going to be very busy
the next few weeks.

15:04.092 --> 15:06.856
Which is why I want you to write down

15:06.928 --> 15:10.193
"bank extra clean"
in your little notebook.

15:10.264 --> 15:12.255
Good night.

15:14.737 --> 15:16.068
Mr. Tuttle?

15:18.173 --> 15:21.506
I'd like to apply to the executive
training program in Wichita,

15:21.578 --> 15:25.571
but before I can, I have to have worked
100 hours as a teller at the branch.

15:25.648 --> 15:28.276
- Take that up with Mrs. Lange.
- I have already.

15:28.351 --> 15:31.115
We've been practicing.
She gave me some money.

15:31.188 --> 15:33.179
She what?

15:33.257 --> 15:35.248
See?

15:37.461 --> 15:40.726
You said you'd think about
giving me some hours at a window.

15:40.799 --> 15:43.324
You have to be able
to keep track of the debits.

15:43.402 --> 15:45.734
A good teller is primarily
a good counter.

15:45.804 --> 15:48.398
A teller keeps track of money
all day long,

15:48.474 --> 15:52.808
taking care to keep the corners on bills
facing the same way.

15:52.879 --> 15:54.870
At the end...

15:56.582 --> 15:58.777
Um... The end...

16:00.988 --> 16:03.047
Ends...

16:04.058 --> 16:06.322
At the end... At the end of the day,

16:06.393 --> 16:09.590
the teller balances the cash
against the payout tickets.

16:09.664 --> 16:12.929
A good teller can go for years
without being out of balance.

16:13.001 --> 16:15.492
Mrs. Lange has never been
out of balance yet.

16:15.570 --> 16:18.437
But the real key
is a friendly personality.

16:18.507 --> 16:22.967
The motto of a teller is,
"Be friendly and accurate."

16:23.045 --> 16:25.809
- "But mostly be accurate."
- Very good, Chris.

16:25.882 --> 16:29.784
Mrs. Lange also says the women's
bathroom fixture needs a new bulb.

16:29.853 --> 16:31.844
Good night.

16:42.266 --> 16:46.032
[announcer] He'll scoop the puck
into the right corner.

16:46.105 --> 16:49.165
Hartigan will center it
to the far boards.

16:49.241 --> 16:54.008
Defense pushed it back to the line
to Lidstrom into the corner for Lang.

16:54.080 --> 16:58.847
Lang floats it back to Lidstrom,
skating on the blue line with it.

16:58.918 --> 17:04.550
Now fires a rising shot. Kicked aside.
But a goal pass by Pascal Leclaire.

17:04.625 --> 17:08.060
[raises volume] Trevor Letowski
carries it out to center ice.

17:08.128 --> 17:13.294
A glove save. Now the puck bounces
away from Lidstrom out to center.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.768
In pursuit Manny Malhotra.

17:15.837 --> 17:18.271
Detroit played better
in the first period.

17:18.339 --> 17:20.171
Malhotra is all over Williams,

17:20.242 --> 17:23.473
forcing the Red Wings to have
a power play in their own zone.

17:23.546 --> 17:26.982
Here comes Lidstrom
over the Columbus line.

17:27.049 --> 17:29.711
Drop pass. Samuelson with a shot.

17:31.155 --> 17:34.556
Passed to Danny Stevens.
Stevens back to Pratt.

17:38.162 --> 17:41.154
Lidstrom right down the center.

17:42.033 --> 17:44.228
Fakes it left.

17:46.905 --> 17:50.136
Pratt fakes a shot on the right
and dekes out the goalie.

17:52.077 --> 17:55.069
- [horn blaring]
- [crowd cheering]

18:00.287 --> 18:01.811
I think Mark...

18:03.223 --> 18:04.656
Game is tied...

18:07.460 --> 18:12.193
And there's Holmstrom,
Johnny-on-the-spot, to fire it in...

18:23.111 --> 18:25.102
You cannot be serious.

18:26.916 --> 18:28.907
That is pathetic.

18:37.061 --> 18:39.052
That's Chris Pratt.

18:42.399 --> 18:44.731
Put that fucking thing out.

18:57.283 --> 19:00.616
[# 78 Saab: No Illusions]

19:09.196 --> 19:12.688
- Can I get you something?
- Yeah, an O'Doul's, please.

19:12.766 --> 19:14.427
Yep.

19:19.907 --> 19:25.140
This lady calls me over and she's, like,
"How many Dorothys live in Kansas?"

19:25.214 --> 19:27.239
Hey.

19:27.850 --> 19:30.842
Can you break a fifty?
Like, tens and fives?

19:34.057 --> 19:37.356
Damn. And I thought I was good-Iooking.

19:39.129 --> 19:40.926
- You having a good time?
- So far.

19:40.998 --> 19:44.399
Well, that's all that matters, right?

19:44.468 --> 19:46.459
Enjoy yourself.

19:49.907 --> 19:53.206
Hey, Chris Pratt, right?

19:53.278 --> 19:55.508
Gary Spargo. We know each other.

19:55.580 --> 19:58.481
I was a couple of years ahead
in your sister's class.

19:58.550 --> 20:01.883
We went out a couple of times,
but never took.

20:01.954 --> 20:04.354
How's she doing, anyway? Alison, right?

20:04.424 --> 20:07.416
Yeah, she's good, man.
She's married. She has a baby.

20:07.493 --> 20:10.860
- Just my luck.
- [phone ringing]

20:10.931 --> 20:13.661
- Well, it was nice seeing you, anyway.
- Yeah.

20:13.734 --> 20:16.726
- You say hello to Alison for me.
- OK.

20:16.804 --> 20:20.069
- Yeah. Where are you?
- It's 2.50, chief.

20:20.141 --> 20:23.941
Ten, twenty, thirty, five, forty...

20:24.012 --> 20:26.207
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago.

20:26.281 --> 20:28.215
- Sorry, how much?
- 2.50.

20:28.284 --> 20:32.118
That's not my problem.
I guess I'll see you later. OK, bye.

20:32.188 --> 20:34.884
- Do you need any change with that?
- No, keep it.

20:34.957 --> 20:38.950
- Thanks, chief.
- Whoa. Excuse me, uh... T.J.

20:39.029 --> 20:43.523
You must be one hell of a bartender,
$17 tip for a $3 beer.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.626
- What can I say?
- You can say, "It's on the house."

20:46.704 --> 20:49.832
- It's not a problem.
- No, no, no, no.

20:49.907 --> 20:54.003
He insists. Don't you, chief?

20:54.078 --> 20:56.103
Yeah. Whatever.

20:57.916 --> 21:00.749
Prick. Shit, I apologize
for that guy, Chris.

21:00.819 --> 21:02.753
[Chris] No, it's OK.

21:02.821 --> 21:07.815
You know, I find myself apologizing
for people pretty often these days.

21:09.129 --> 21:14.567
I heard something happened to you.
So, what was it? Motorcycle accident?

21:14.635 --> 21:17.263
If you don't mind me asking.
I'm just curious.

21:17.338 --> 21:19.932
It was a car accident.
I was driving at night

21:20.007 --> 21:24.671
and I hit a combine that was stalled
in the middle of the road, old Route 24.

21:24.746 --> 21:27.738
Well, how does a thing like that happen?

21:29.418 --> 21:31.750
- I had the lights off.
- Really?

21:31.820 --> 21:34.983
They say I got thrown 90 feet.

21:35.057 --> 21:36.786
Wait, I'm sorry. "They" say?

21:36.859 --> 21:38.952
Well, no, I can't remember any of it.

21:39.028 --> 21:41.292
Well, thank God for that.

21:41.364 --> 21:44.128
I remember, uh, right before it
and right after it

21:44.201 --> 21:48.865
and one moment where I thought
the medevac was gonna land on top of me.

21:48.939 --> 21:50.930
Anybody die?

21:52.277 --> 21:54.268
Yeah, two friends.

21:54.345 --> 21:57.075
- You do any time?
- No.

21:57.148 --> 22:00.242
But you're doing your time right now,
though, right?

22:00.318 --> 22:03.253
So, you drink near beer and what else?

22:03.322 --> 22:07.190
It's like I can pick up a glass
with this hand,

22:07.259 --> 22:09.819
can't always drink from it.

22:09.895 --> 22:12.955
I fall asleep a lot, just nod off
in the middle of things.

22:13.033 --> 22:15.263
- Yeah, me, too.
- [chuckles] Oh, yeah?

22:15.335 --> 22:21.103
Yeah. Well, I call tomatoes "lemons."
I know that's wrong.

22:21.175 --> 22:25.202
And sometimes certain colors
have certain smells.

22:25.279 --> 22:27.509
- That's weird.
- [inhaler hisses]

22:28.951 --> 22:32.216
Well, we all got our problems, right?

22:32.287 --> 22:38.089
There's an expression: "God closes
a door, but he opens a window."

22:38.161 --> 22:40.959
Or he closes the window
and he opens the door.

22:41.030 --> 22:42.759
My point is...

22:42.832 --> 22:47.235
...sometimes something good
comes from an accident, you know?

22:47.303 --> 22:50.795
Sometimes you're out there and you...

22:51.675 --> 22:55.702
Man, she really wears that sweater,
doesn't she?

22:57.916 --> 22:58.905
Fuck.

23:02.420 --> 23:04.854
Anyway, it was a pleasure, Chris.

23:04.923 --> 23:07.255
- Yeah.
- Take it easy.

23:56.881 --> 24:00.373
[Chris] Once upon a time, I woke up.

24:01.552 --> 24:03.645
I took a shower with soap.

24:05.591 --> 24:08.992
I had breakfast.
I didn't read the paper.

24:11.764 --> 24:13.755
I put on my coat.

24:15.301 --> 24:18.293
I had Thanksgiving dinner
with my family.

24:27.014 --> 24:29.915
[Chris] Coming around to you.

24:33.521 --> 24:36.012
- Got your key?
- Yeah, I got my key.

24:37.258 --> 24:40.455
- I smell money.
- Shut up.

24:44.700 --> 24:47.635
Barb, did you make any of this?

24:47.703 --> 24:50.604
- No, I'm afraid not.
- You used the thin ones, right?

24:50.674 --> 24:55.077
- Not the thick nighttime ones?
- Yes, Alison, I used the thin ones.

24:55.145 --> 24:57.613
You look great.
Lots of color in your cheeks.

24:57.681 --> 25:01.310
- Not sure about this coat, though.
- Where's that from? Tenth grade?

25:01.386 --> 25:05.083
- Well, I like this coat.
- I bumped into Marilyn Hess last week.

25:05.156 --> 25:08.125
She had Charlotte with her.
Wasn't she in your class?

25:09.662 --> 25:12.096
She was in my class.
Conrad was in Chris's.

25:12.164 --> 25:15.258
Charlotte said for you to call her.
She looks fantastic.

25:15.334 --> 25:17.928
- Lost quite a bit of weight.
- I love mushrooms.

25:18.004 --> 25:21.997
What do you call a mushroom who goes
into the bar, buys everybody a drink?

25:22.075 --> 25:25.101
- I don't know. What?
- A fungi.

25:27.281 --> 25:30.341
This is all very good.
The relish in particular is nice.

25:30.418 --> 25:34.184
- Not too tart, not too sweet.
- It was my grandmother's recipe.

25:34.255 --> 25:38.214
Any other old family recipes?
We can use them for the restaurant.

25:38.293 --> 25:41.421
- Restaurant?
- Chris didn't tell you?

25:41.496 --> 25:43.487
No. He didn't tell us.

25:43.565 --> 25:46.591
What exactly would you do
at a restaurant, Chris?

25:49.005 --> 25:53.601
- Well, I'd help Lewis.
- We found a space, but it needs work.

25:53.676 --> 25:56.201
- [Barbara] Where?
- Waverly, near Overland.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.976
- Where is that?
- Southside. It's a gas station.

25:59.049 --> 26:01.415
A gas station? Really?

26:01.485 --> 26:05.251
We'd keep the door open during summer
for an al fresco kind of thing.

26:05.323 --> 26:08.121
If it's a gas station,
you'd have to do some work...

26:08.193 --> 26:11.026
We're just fucking talking about it, OK?

26:15.735 --> 26:17.726
Excuse me.

26:30.183 --> 26:33.710
- There are some steps.
- Oh.

26:33.788 --> 26:36.621
Well, then, you better carry me.

26:36.691 --> 26:38.682
Really?

26:43.832 --> 26:46.266
- [knock on door]
- Chris?

26:46.335 --> 26:47.927
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

26:48.003 --> 26:51.996
We gotta go. If I don't get her
down soon, she'll never sleep.

26:54.577 --> 26:57.273
You should come by sometime.
We'll hang out.

26:57.347 --> 27:01.613
And Dad's waiting down in the war room.

27:01.685 --> 27:04.415
Hey, uh, you remember a Gary Spargo?

27:04.488 --> 27:06.581
- Who?
- Gary Spargo.

27:06.657 --> 27:09.148
He said he went out with you
a couple of times.

27:09.227 --> 27:12.094
Well, he probably did.

27:12.164 --> 27:16.123
- You look good. It's great to see you.
- Thanks.

27:16.201 --> 27:19.136
Alison, right?

27:19.205 --> 27:22.971
Say goodbye to Uncle Chris.
All right, we'll see you later.

27:24.811 --> 27:29.077
In the last three years, we opened two
Jaguar stores and one Land Rover store.

27:29.149 --> 27:33.483
So we're all about Ford now. But a
PorschelAudi franchise, that'd be tight.

27:33.554 --> 27:35.988
What do you do
for the company, Cameron?

27:36.056 --> 27:38.081
As little as possible.

27:38.159 --> 27:40.491
Boy, you got me on the run here.

27:40.562 --> 27:42.792
- There's a comforting sound.
- This new?

27:42.864 --> 27:45.628
It was a gift from Charlie.
Whitehall, my partner.

27:45.701 --> 27:49.159
Yeah, I know who Charlie Whitehall is.

27:49.238 --> 27:52.332
- It's a nice gun.
- It's your move.

27:52.408 --> 27:54.899
Check, by the way.

27:59.082 --> 28:01.073
What'd you do?

28:02.652 --> 28:04.882
- Sure you wanna do that?
- I think so.

28:04.956 --> 28:07.481
You're gonna lose your queen, right?

28:07.558 --> 28:10.049
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm gonna take her.

28:14.399 --> 28:17.527
Check. In fact, checkmate.

28:20.305 --> 28:23.172
- I didn't see that.
- I got lucky.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.837
- Good game, Dad.
- We got time for another quick one.

28:25.912 --> 28:27.971
I think we should go. Lewis, wanna go?

28:28.047 --> 28:29.878
Would you rather I let you win?

28:32.453 --> 28:35.616
Dad, I can't play chess anymore.

28:36.957 --> 28:38.288
I'm sorry.

28:41.897 --> 28:44.991
- Well, it's good seeing you.
- Good seeing you.

28:45.066 --> 28:47.057
Happy Thanksgiving, son.

28:48.637 --> 28:51.936
Can I say something?
You won't get upset?

28:52.008 --> 28:53.999
[Chris] What?

28:54.877 --> 28:57.209
I don't think
you should go home anymore.

29:04.655 --> 29:05.952
[knocking]

29:10.128 --> 29:14.087
- Jesus, Ted, you snuck up on me.
- I'm supposed to sneak up on you.

29:14.165 --> 29:17.225
They didn't have no more jellies,
so I got you a custard.

29:17.302 --> 29:19.293
- Thanks. You got a cold, Ted?
- [sneezes]

29:19.371 --> 29:23.569
No wonder I don't got pneumonia, given
the house is cold enough to hang meat.

29:23.642 --> 29:24.631
How come?

29:24.710 --> 29:27.144
Sherry won't have the heat on
after nine.

29:27.212 --> 29:28.679
Because of the baby.

29:28.748 --> 29:31.012
We don't refer to it
as "the baby" no more.

29:31.084 --> 29:34.417
- We don't?
- Sherry calls it "the little engine."

29:34.487 --> 29:36.819
- It makes her hot all the time.
- Right.

29:36.890 --> 29:39.984
Doctor told her she's got
three times more blood in her

29:40.061 --> 29:42.029
and that's why she can't cool off.

29:42.096 --> 29:45.327
Kid's not even born yet,
I'm already awake all night.

29:45.399 --> 29:49.893
You're lucky you don't ever
have to worry about that stuff.

29:49.972 --> 29:52.998
I gotta go.
Remember, lock the back door.

29:53.075 --> 29:54.702
I will.

29:55.978 --> 29:58.970
- You left your door open again.
- Oh, shit.

30:03.319 --> 30:06.982
[# Black Rebel Motorcycle Club:
Shuffle Your Feet]

30:08.492 --> 30:11.427
I thought I was good-Iooking.

30:11.495 --> 30:14.987
- Excuse me?
- I thought I was good-Iooking.

30:15.867 --> 30:18.392
Well, maybe you were.

30:24.910 --> 30:28.175
- Chris Pratt?
- Yeah.

30:28.247 --> 30:31.239
My friend would like to buy you a drink.

30:35.422 --> 30:39.017
I used to dance at Wet Willy's.
You know that place in Raytown?

30:39.092 --> 30:41.253
It got closed down
on account of debts,

30:41.328 --> 30:45.424
so right now I'm working with Maura
at the chamber of commerce.

30:45.500 --> 30:49.027
I'm answering phones.
What do you do?

30:49.103 --> 30:51.537
Oh, I, um...

30:51.606 --> 30:54.598
- Sorry, I forgot your name.
- Again?

30:58.647 --> 31:02.947
It's Luvlee. L-U-V-L-E-E.

31:03.019 --> 31:05.010
Luvlee.

31:05.088 --> 31:07.716
Now you'll remember me.

31:07.791 --> 31:10.191
Anything about Kansas City,
I can tell you.

31:10.260 --> 31:14.219
- Yeah? Like what?
- Did you know Teflon was invented here?

31:14.298 --> 31:16.892
And Eskimo Pies.
And McDonald's Happy Meals.

31:16.967 --> 31:20.869
And "Melts in your mouth,
not in your hands," M&M candy coating.

31:20.939 --> 31:23.032
You guys are so interesting.

31:23.108 --> 31:27.374
Why don't we go somewhere quiet where
we can hear what you two have to say?

31:27.446 --> 31:29.414
- Why don't we do that?
- You wanna come?

31:32.585 --> 31:36.521
[soft music playing]

31:36.589 --> 31:40.821
[moaning]

31:48.670 --> 31:52.265
That's better.
I've seen you play hockey, you know.

31:52.340 --> 31:55.275
Me and Alice Watts used to
watch you play all the time.

31:55.343 --> 31:57.072
I don't remember you.

31:57.145 --> 32:00.308
I saw you play the night you beat
the Raytown Cougars

32:00.382 --> 32:02.407
for the state championships.

32:02.485 --> 32:06.182
It was your birthday.
Do you remember that?

32:06.255 --> 32:09.691
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a good game.
- Yeah, it was.

32:09.759 --> 32:14.787
You got your second five-minute major
right at the end of the game.

32:14.865 --> 32:17.129
Next game you would have
sat on the bench.

32:17.201 --> 32:21.228
But it was the last game of the season,
and you knew that it didn't matter.

32:21.305 --> 32:25.036
So what do you do? You go and slash
the hell out of some shitty player

32:25.109 --> 32:27.100
at the end of a game you already won.

32:27.179 --> 32:31.115
And, still, the whole crowd sings
Happy Birthday to you.

32:33.218 --> 32:38.554
Me and Alice Watts were, like, "Damn, it
must be pretty cool to be Chris Pratt."

32:41.628 --> 32:43.619
Don't mind me.

33:04.620 --> 33:09.080
And then I heard what happened to you
and Nina and Danny and...

33:10.993 --> 33:13.689
What was the name of the pretty girl?

33:13.764 --> 33:16.756
- Kelly.
- Kelly, that's right.

33:18.769 --> 33:21.704
And everyone was talking about how you,

33:21.773 --> 33:26.369
you know, you woke up this other guy.

33:27.111 --> 33:29.773
I remember thinking,
"God, we're the same age.

33:29.847 --> 33:32.839
That could be me that it happened to."

33:34.987 --> 33:36.978
Anyways...

33:39.091 --> 33:41.082
- Are you OK?
- I wanna see you naked.

33:42.829 --> 33:48.631
- Shit. I'm sorry.
- No, don't be. I'm flattered.

33:53.374 --> 33:56.502
- Oh, you got cold hands.
- Sorry. [chuckles]

34:07.055 --> 34:09.250
I see something still works.

34:09.324 --> 34:13.591
- You don't have to do this.
- I know. I want to.

34:30.581 --> 34:33.983
[Gary] How does a titan like Robert
Pratt feel about you living here?

34:34.052 --> 34:36.315
[Chris] He's never seen it.

34:36.389 --> 34:38.380
Really?

34:41.092 --> 34:44.790
Tomorrow a bunch of us are hanging
at this farm we're borrowing,

34:44.864 --> 34:48.197
celebrate Thanksgiving dinner,
if you wanna come.

34:48.268 --> 34:50.327
But wasn't that last week?

34:50.404 --> 34:53.965
Yeah, well,
we're just getting around to it.

34:54.041 --> 34:56.839
Luvlee wrote the address down
in your notebook.

35:04.119 --> 35:06.451
Hey, you know something?

35:06.522 --> 35:09.013
You're better than this.

35:10.259 --> 35:12.250
A lot better.

35:52.973 --> 35:54.964
- Chris?
- Yeah.

35:55.042 --> 35:58.569
- Doc Watson's got nothing on me, man.
- Well, good night.

35:58.645 --> 36:01.512
You get stoned?
With somebody wearing perfume?

36:01.583 --> 36:05.519
- No.
- No, no, stop. Don't move.

36:05.587 --> 36:08.317
- Were you with a lady tonight?
- [sighs]

36:08.390 --> 36:10.585
Son of a bitch, you got laid.

36:10.659 --> 36:14.891
- I don't really wanna talk about it.
- Oh, but you are, my friend, you are.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.558
Come here.

36:17.633 --> 36:22.127
So, tell me... did you get a hummer?

36:22.205 --> 36:25.197
- Jesus, Lewis.
- All right. At least tell me her name.

36:25.275 --> 36:28.472
- Luvlee something.
- Lovely? That's a name?

36:28.546 --> 36:32.607
Yes. L-U-V-L-E-E.

36:32.683 --> 36:37.746
That's a new one. So what's this
Luvlee something look like, huh?

36:40.459 --> 36:41.448
She's nice.

36:41.527 --> 36:43.927
Here I am sitting at home alone
every night

36:43.996 --> 36:48.262
while you're out getting blown and God
knows what else by Luvlee something,

36:48.334 --> 36:50.564
who probably has a friend.

36:50.637 --> 36:52.969
- Lemons. That's what it is.
- What what is?

36:53.039 --> 36:56.202
- That's her last name.
- Luvlee Lemons? That's her name?

36:56.277 --> 37:01.146
Well, it's her stage name.
She's a performer. Or she was.

37:01.215 --> 37:04.582
And by stage, I'm assuming
you mean the kind with a pole?

37:04.652 --> 37:07.120
- What do you mean?
- Let's move on.

37:07.189 --> 37:10.181
- Where'd you meet her?
- Gary introduced me to her.

37:10.258 --> 37:13.591
- Who's Gary? Gary who?
- Gary Spargo.

37:13.662 --> 37:15.823
- Do I know this guy?
- I don't think so.

37:15.898 --> 37:19.061
- I just met him down at the local.
- Huh.

37:20.903 --> 37:25.636
- Well, I better get some sleep.
- Yeah. Yeah, you better.

37:25.709 --> 37:28.041
You dog.

37:31.949 --> 37:33.940
Gary Spargo.

37:59.446 --> 38:01.505
[groaning]

38:01.582 --> 38:03.641
- [sighs]
- [urinating]

38:05.486 --> 38:07.647
Whoa! You scared me.

38:08.689 --> 38:11.988
- I'm Chris.
- Yeah, yeah. Aaron Cork.

38:15.697 --> 38:19.133
Got a good grip. Come on in.
We've been waiting on you.

38:21.204 --> 38:24.469
- Is turkey supposed to be rare?
- I don't think so.

38:24.541 --> 38:28.477
I totally undercooked it. I've gotta
put it back in. You have to help me.

38:28.545 --> 38:30.877
Hey. You made it.

38:30.948 --> 38:34.349
Tortilla salad, pierogies, egg rolls.
We made too much food.

38:34.418 --> 38:39.287
- There's nine of us.
- There's seven. You, me, Cork, Marty...

38:39.357 --> 38:40.688
Never mind.

38:44.262 --> 38:48.358
I'm the chef.
Go on. They're waiting for you.

38:48.434 --> 38:52.097
You smoke a joint to relax,
but you won't let me rub your shoulders.

38:52.171 --> 38:53.832
I will never let you touch me.

38:53.906 --> 38:56.431
You're not comfortable
with your sexuality.

38:56.509 --> 38:58.170
Don't move.

38:58.245 --> 39:01.840
Everybody,
this is Chris "Slap Shot" Pratt.

39:01.915 --> 39:03.576
Hey, Chris. How you doing?

39:03.650 --> 39:07.142
- Here's the Corker. Avoid that guy.
- Too late. We're old pals.

39:07.221 --> 39:11.555
This is Marty. Marty is the guy
you wanna teach you how to surf.

39:11.626 --> 39:15.585
- He's the only boy in Kansas knows how.
- I went to Framington, man.

39:15.664 --> 39:17.791
We played you guys in Division A.

39:17.866 --> 39:20.960
- I didn't really do sports.
- Gare, we gotta jam.

39:21.036 --> 39:22.435
Too bad.

39:24.206 --> 39:26.436
How many of these things
you gonna need?

39:26.509 --> 39:29.307
- I'm gonna take all of them. Thanks.
- Cool.

39:29.379 --> 39:31.904
Good seeing you guys.

39:31.982 --> 39:34.314
Marty, watch out. It's heavy.

39:34.385 --> 39:38.151
- Hey, sit down. Sit down.
- This your farm?

39:38.222 --> 39:42.682
My Uncle Bone found it
and kind of negotiated with the owner.

39:42.760 --> 39:44.591
- Wanna try some wine?
- I can't.

39:44.663 --> 39:46.563
Come on. Take it.

39:46.632 --> 39:49.157
- Marty?
- Yes.

39:49.234 --> 39:51.896
Nice. One for me.

39:51.970 --> 39:54.768
And toast.

39:54.841 --> 39:58.743
How about, uh... Fuck it. Family, right?

39:58.811 --> 40:01.177
- Hey, yeah. Cheers, man.
- Family's good.

40:01.247 --> 40:02.839
Family.

40:02.916 --> 40:05.851
- Welcome.
- Who are all these people?

40:05.919 --> 40:08.752
- Whose place is this?
- Friend of a friend. Bone?

40:08.822 --> 40:11.985
- Dinner is served.
- It's about time.

40:12.060 --> 40:14.051
- Can we get some water?
- Food.

40:14.129 --> 40:17.360
- Why the hell we eating burritos?
- Get your own water.

40:17.432 --> 40:20.230
- Want some gravy?
- What's wrong?

40:20.301 --> 40:24.237
Nothing.
I just remembered why I came here.

40:24.306 --> 40:29.505
- [chattering]
- [music playing]

40:42.026 --> 40:44.517
I'm just saying...

40:48.099 --> 40:49.828
[Gary] Check this out.

40:56.475 --> 40:58.670
[Maura]... some old farmhouse.

40:58.745 --> 41:00.975
I don't know where it is.

41:01.047 --> 41:02.981
No, that's water.

41:04.217 --> 41:06.879
Mommy's doing dishes.

41:06.953 --> 41:10.548
Mommy's cleaning up
after a bunch of pigs.

41:10.624 --> 41:13.616
I'll see you in three weeks.

41:13.694 --> 41:18.825
Tell Grandma to put it on the calendar
this time. I love you, too.

41:18.900 --> 41:21.095
[gunfire on TV]

41:22.604 --> 41:23.593
Hey, Gare.

41:26.309 --> 41:29.005
Hey, man. Why don't you come on down?

41:30.546 --> 41:32.537
Couldn't sleep, huh?

41:32.615 --> 41:36.608
Well, that's the thing about good wine.
Doesn't make you sleepy.

41:36.687 --> 41:40.145
But, then, it doesn't give you
a hangover either, so...

41:40.224 --> 41:42.624
Unless your brain's all fucked up.

41:42.693 --> 41:45.787
- You played for Framington, right?
- No, man.

41:46.931 --> 41:50.025
Let me just clean up some of this mess.

41:50.101 --> 41:51.159
[groans]

41:52.203 --> 41:54.433
What's this?

41:54.507 --> 41:58.841
This? This is a project I've been
working on for very many months.

41:58.911 --> 42:03.644
Probably not ready
for anyone to see yet, but such is life.

42:03.717 --> 42:06.652
- These all banks?
- Mm-hmm. That's right, Chris.

42:06.720 --> 42:10.622
They're all banks.

42:10.690 --> 42:12.954
Why are you taking pictures of banks?

42:13.027 --> 42:16.053
- Because I'm gonna rob one of them.
- [both chuckling]

42:16.130 --> 42:18.223
Well, we're gonna rob one of them.

42:18.299 --> 42:21.166
Some nice little farm bank
in the ass-end of nowhere

42:21.235 --> 42:25.035
where they get
all that winter harvest cash.

42:25.107 --> 42:27.769
You know what I'm talking about?

42:27.843 --> 42:31.802
- You wanna steal from farmers?
- No, Chris.

42:31.881 --> 42:36.375
I'm gonna steal from the corporate
fuckers who rape the farmers.

42:36.452 --> 42:39.512
Agribusiness fat cats
who give the American farmer

42:39.589 --> 42:42.149
enough to grow his crop
but not enough to live.

42:42.226 --> 42:45.753
- Fucking tragedy is what it is.
- Totally tragic.

42:45.830 --> 42:49.857
So we gotta find a bank
in the middle of a lot of big farms

42:49.935 --> 42:53.200
where one time a year,
i.e., right now,

42:53.271 --> 42:55.762
they're gonna fill that vault with cash

42:55.841 --> 42:59.971
so that Farmer John can pay
Juan or Ramon to pick his crops.

43:01.881 --> 43:06.477
There's this quiet, empty place

43:06.552 --> 43:08.144
with no security to speak of,

43:08.221 --> 43:11.349
and this quiet, empty place
no one really knows exists.

43:12.326 --> 43:16.820
I mean, isn't that why you drive an hour
and a half each way to work there?

43:18.733 --> 43:20.724
What is this?

43:22.136 --> 43:26.334
Chris, I will totally understand if
you feel betrayed, but I need your help.

43:26.407 --> 43:28.967
You want me to rob the bank.

43:29.044 --> 43:32.343
- I can't do that.
- Why not, huh? Because it's wrong?

43:32.414 --> 43:37.283
I don't know, but if I had... If I had
my life ripped out from underneath me

43:37.354 --> 43:40.482
the way you had your life
ripped out from underneath you,

43:40.557 --> 43:44.891
I don't think I'd give even half a rat's
ass about what was right or wrong.

43:44.961 --> 43:47.657
I'd just fucking want
my old life back, you know?

43:47.732 --> 43:51.498
Look at this shit.
Mopping floors, man.

43:51.569 --> 43:54.902
Don't you want your old life back?

43:54.972 --> 43:57.770
- You can't give that to me.
- No, I can't.

43:57.843 --> 44:00.573
But I can give you something
maybe even better.

44:00.646 --> 44:03.012
I can give you the power.

44:03.081 --> 44:05.845
- Power?
- Mm-hmm.

44:05.919 --> 44:08.251
Power.

44:08.321 --> 44:10.881
Why don't you sit down?
I'll tell you about it.

44:11.591 --> 44:13.388
Please?

44:13.459 --> 44:19.227
My old man used to say to me, probably
the only thing we ever really agreed on,

44:19.300 --> 44:22.030
whoever has the money has the power.

44:22.102 --> 44:24.434
You might wanna jot that down
in your book.

44:24.506 --> 44:27.236
It's something
you're gonna need to remember.

44:27.309 --> 44:30.608
Do you have the power right now
in your life, Chris? Huh?

44:30.679 --> 44:33.079
- Do you?
- I don't know.

44:33.149 --> 44:37.677
How many janitors you know
have any kind of power to speak of?

44:39.522 --> 44:42.286
Here's a question.

44:42.359 --> 44:44.725
Who pays for your life?

44:44.795 --> 44:47.457
You go to the ATM,
what, two, three times a week?

44:47.531 --> 44:50.022
- Three.
- Three times. Wow.

44:50.100 --> 44:53.536
Where does that money come from?
You drive a car.

44:53.604 --> 44:56.630
Who pays for that?
Who pays for the insurance?

44:56.708 --> 44:59.768
Given your track history,
it must be more than the rent,

44:59.844 --> 45:02.745
which gets paid on the first
of every month by who?

45:02.815 --> 45:04.476
- Daddy.
- Bingo.

45:04.550 --> 45:07.610
Your old man,
he'll pay money to take care of you,

45:07.686 --> 45:11.747
but he won't give you enough money
to take care of yourself. Why not?

45:11.825 --> 45:15.420
He doesn't think that you can,
so he just doles out enough money

45:15.495 --> 45:18.953
so that you have to depend on him.

45:19.032 --> 45:22.832
You're as stuck as the farmers, Chris.
You star in your own tragedy.

45:22.903 --> 45:25.303
My father would give me money
if I asked.

45:25.373 --> 45:29.537
Hey, hey, hey.
That's... That's bullshit.

45:30.312 --> 45:32.906
I'm sorry. Let's call him up.

45:35.083 --> 45:36.641
Call him up, ask him.

45:36.718 --> 45:41.212
Ask him for ten grand
and see what he says.

45:41.290 --> 45:45.624
Hell, ask him for one grand
and see what he says.

45:47.097 --> 45:50.658
Tell him you wanna start a business.

45:52.269 --> 45:55.204
You can't.

45:55.272 --> 46:00.539
I know. I mean, you know,
I went to prison for my sins, Chris,

46:00.612 --> 46:03.012
so I don't have to carry them
around with me.

46:03.081 --> 46:07.381
But you, your old man picked up the tab,

46:07.453 --> 46:10.980
so now you drive out
Old Farm Road 24 once a week

46:11.057 --> 46:14.515
to the spot just to remind yourself,
keep it fresh in your head,

46:14.593 --> 46:18.689
just what a piece of shit
you think you are.

46:18.765 --> 46:21.325
- I thought we were friends.
- We are friends.

46:21.401 --> 46:26.270
Outside of some old blind guy
dressed like Larry Flynt,

46:26.340 --> 46:29.332
I'm the best friend you got right now,
and I mean that.

46:29.410 --> 46:33.403
You were Chris Pratt. I was three years
ahead of you and I looked up to you.

46:33.481 --> 46:36.712
You were fucking beautiful.

46:36.785 --> 46:38.150
But then...

46:41.490 --> 46:46.257
Well, now... I'm gonna help you.

46:47.297 --> 46:50.130
- How?
- I'll say it again.

46:50.200 --> 46:53.192
Maybe you'll write it down this time.

46:54.972 --> 46:57.964
Whoever has the money has the power.

47:03.448 --> 47:07.248
Chris? Where are you going?
Are you leaving?

47:20.133 --> 47:22.124
Come on, sweetie.

47:45.494 --> 47:48.759
[Lewis] We figure it's 30,000
to convert to a restaurant,

47:48.832 --> 47:52.632
another ten or so to get us up on
our feet, plus or minus a few thousand.

47:52.702 --> 47:55.728
Show him the menu, kid.

47:59.744 --> 48:01.507
Is there a separate dinner menu?

48:01.579 --> 48:04.480
We're just gonna be open
for breakfast and lunch.

48:04.549 --> 48:08.041
- That way we have our nights free.
- I see.

48:08.120 --> 48:10.315
OK, we have the Abbie, the Huey.

48:10.389 --> 48:14.223
- Who are these sandwiches named after?
- People I've admired.

48:14.293 --> 48:17.888
- We could name one after you.
- I don't think that's necessary.

48:17.964 --> 48:21.456
- Sure, sure. Why not?
- Well, that's very kind, but...

48:21.534 --> 48:24.765
What's your first name?

48:24.837 --> 48:27.203
- Reuben.
- What's your middle name?

48:27.274 --> 48:30.368
- Lewis...
- 30,000 seems a little low, boys.

48:30.444 --> 48:34.676
- This place is a gas station now?
- Yeah, but you make that work for you.

48:34.748 --> 48:39.685
Keep the gas station theme, maybe
you park a VW bus at one of the pumps,

48:39.754 --> 48:42.018
paint the name of the place on the side.

48:42.090 --> 48:46.550
Yeah, the name of the place.
Uh... Yes. Lew's...

48:46.629 --> 48:49.860
Lew's Your Lunch.
See, I'm Lewis, Lew.

48:49.932 --> 48:53.095
The place is just gonna be open
for breakfast and...

48:53.169 --> 48:55.000
It's very clever.

48:55.072 --> 48:58.769
- But we don't have to call it that.
- Yeah, I got lots of ideas.

48:58.842 --> 49:03.472
Aside from that Reuben hiccup,
I think it went pretty well.

49:03.548 --> 49:07.985
I've got a good feeling about it.
Our man Hearn was jazzed.

49:08.052 --> 49:12.751
I don't know if you noticed. I think
he was pretty excited, don't you think?

49:13.359 --> 49:15.418
Chris?

49:15.494 --> 49:19.055
- Chris?
- I'm right here, Lewis.

49:19.131 --> 49:21.964
- I thought you left me.
- I didn't leave you.

49:24.871 --> 49:27.772
Come on. I'll drive you back to work.

49:27.841 --> 49:31.834
[Reggie] Who can tell me
our three organizational strategies?

49:33.648 --> 49:35.639
- Ritual.
- [writing on chalkboard]

49:37.885 --> 49:39.876
Pattern.

49:41.890 --> 49:44.484
And... repetition.

49:44.559 --> 49:46.550
- [Chris] Shit.
- Very good.

50:06.684 --> 50:08.675
Hey.

50:15.860 --> 50:21.355
If you ever wanna stay late,
we could practice counting or...

50:21.434 --> 50:24.562
Technically, I don't know
that I'm pussy-whipped per se,

50:24.637 --> 50:27.003
- but she's got me on a goddamned pager.
- [beeps]

50:27.074 --> 50:30.874
In case she breaks water or whatever
while I'm on my shift.

50:30.944 --> 50:32.707
I don't know. Oh!

50:32.779 --> 50:35.475
Hey, missed a spot.

50:35.549 --> 50:37.915
Right there.

50:37.985 --> 50:39.748
See?

50:58.808 --> 51:01.402
[phone ringing]

51:01.478 --> 51:03.207
- [Robert] Hello.
- [Chris] Dad?

51:03.279 --> 51:06.510
- Chris? What time is it?
- I don't know.

51:06.584 --> 51:09.212
- Is he all right?
- Tell her I'm all right.

51:09.286 --> 51:13.086
- He's fine. You all right? You sure?
- Yeah, Dad, I'm fine.

51:13.157 --> 51:16.024
I just wanted to know
if I could borrow $10,000.

51:16.094 --> 51:18.995
- What?
- I need to borrow $10,000.

51:19.064 --> 51:21.555
- What for?
- I just need it.

51:21.633 --> 51:25.501
- It's three o'clock in the morning...
- OK, then, $ 1,000.

51:25.571 --> 51:30.099
- Could I borrow $1,000?
- Is this for that stupid restaurant?

51:30.176 --> 51:32.235
- No.
- Are you in some kind of trouble?

51:32.312 --> 51:35.475
No, Dad, I'm not in trouble.
I just wanted to call you...

51:35.549 --> 51:38.609
Because if you are,
I wanna help out in any way I can.

51:38.685 --> 51:43.019
I just think you should come over and
we should talk about it face to face.

51:43.091 --> 51:45.616
I have an idea.
I wanted to start a business.

51:45.693 --> 51:50.255
With $1,000? Exactly what sort of
business could you start with $1,000?

51:50.331 --> 51:55.394
Well, I was thinking I could start
a skate-sharpening business.

51:55.471 --> 51:59.066
You know, over at the...
over at the rink by the library.

51:59.141 --> 52:01.905
And then later
I could even sell hockey equipment.

52:01.978 --> 52:03.969
- Look, Chris...
- You're saying no.

52:04.047 --> 52:07.039
- Yes.
- Did you say yes?

52:07.117 --> 52:11.679
- No, you can't have the goddamn money.
- Robert.

52:11.756 --> 52:14.987
- Look, Chris...
- Dad, that's fine. I understand.

52:15.827 --> 52:18.762
- Hey, buddy, can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.

52:18.831 --> 52:20.822
- Do you wanna come home?
- What?

52:20.899 --> 52:24.801
You don't have to be afraid to ask.
The door is always open for you here.

52:24.870 --> 52:26.861
I gotta go, Dad.

52:31.478 --> 52:33.969
[Chris] Once upon a time, I woke up.

52:35.315 --> 52:38.512
I took a shower with soap.

52:40.788 --> 52:44.952
I skipped breakfast
so that I could follow an armored car.

52:50.899 --> 52:53.390
I cased the Noel Town bank.

53:05.749 --> 53:09.742
I rented an acetylene tank
for the cutting torch.

53:11.388 --> 53:13.049
[tires screeching]

53:17.228 --> 53:19.719
Cork and I went car shopping.

53:24.470 --> 53:27.166
And then I took pictures of the vault.

53:28.707 --> 53:30.538
[knocking]

53:38.184 --> 53:40.618
- Ted.
- Freezing out there.

53:40.687 --> 53:43.178
- What are you taking pictures of?
- Nothing.

53:43.257 --> 53:44.918
I just, uh...

53:45.760 --> 53:50.094
I just wanted to show my parents
where I work, that's all.

53:50.164 --> 53:52.655
Give me the camera, Chris.

53:55.337 --> 53:58.033
Go stand over there.

54:00.008 --> 54:04.001
I'm sure your parents would like
to see you in the picture.

54:04.080 --> 54:05.604
I know mine would.

54:05.682 --> 54:10.210
My dad one time took a video of me
giving this guy a speeding ticket.

54:10.286 --> 54:12.277
[chuckles] That's my dad.

54:13.090 --> 54:16.321
Why don't you put your hand
on the handle there? Yeah.

54:16.393 --> 54:19.624
Yeah, that's great, that's great.
Say "Go Mustangs!"

54:20.565 --> 54:23.796
Vault looks like an antique
Hogue and Langehammer.

54:23.868 --> 54:27.031
The lock's a 1922 Moss Hamilton.

54:27.105 --> 54:29.903
Dual custody with
a three-movement S&G time lock,

54:29.976 --> 54:34.072
another S&G mounted vertically down,
whatever that means.

54:34.146 --> 54:36.137
I say we just cut through the side.

54:36.215 --> 54:39.878
Vault's so old, it's not gonna be
wired, probably got blind spots.

54:39.953 --> 54:43.616
Jackhammer the cement, torch the skin.

54:43.690 --> 54:46.318
Town's so dead
no one's gonna hear anything.

54:46.393 --> 54:48.623
- Cameras?
- I'm working on that.

54:48.696 --> 54:52.063
Chris, my number's in there.
Call the minute the money comes.

54:52.133 --> 54:55.591
- We go in there Friday.
- That's my job? Just to call you?

54:55.670 --> 54:59.367
No. On the night, your job will be
to watch out for Deputy Doughnut.

54:59.441 --> 55:03.172
He drives by, never at the same time,
so there's no way to plan for him.

55:03.245 --> 55:07.306
- That's it?
- That's it? Dude, that's a lot.

55:07.384 --> 55:11.946
That's the most important job of all.
You're the lookout.

55:24.335 --> 55:27.304
Hi. I'd like to exchange this, please.

55:28.807 --> 55:32.800
- Yeah, this is good.
- Excellent choice, sir.

55:37.350 --> 55:39.784
- [Luvlee laughs]
- [Chris] Shh!

55:39.852 --> 55:41.945
You're gonna wake up Lewis.

55:43.356 --> 55:47.417
[Luvlee] I've never seen a blind person
up close before.

55:56.137 --> 55:58.230
- What...?
- Oh, that.

55:58.306 --> 56:02.174
They did that so I could breathe.
I was in a coma for ten days.

56:02.243 --> 56:04.541
Ouch.

56:04.613 --> 56:07.411
Do you remember?

56:07.483 --> 56:10.850
I just remember I opened my eyes,

56:10.920 --> 56:15.289
I saw my dad sitting there,
and I go, "I love you, Boomer."

56:15.358 --> 56:17.417
And then he starts crying.

56:17.494 --> 56:21.726
- You call your dad Boomer?
- No, that's the name of my first dog.

56:24.602 --> 56:28.436
Yeah. He was a hunting dog.
He was a Chesapeake Bay retriever.

56:28.506 --> 56:31.066
The only one in the world
that couldn't swim.

56:31.143 --> 56:34.044
- You used to shoot birds?
- Ducks, geese, and deer.

56:34.113 --> 56:36.377
With my dad and my idiot brother.

56:36.448 --> 56:42.284
- And you liked doing that?
- No. But I was good at it.

56:43.289 --> 56:44.950
What a surprise.

56:47.694 --> 56:49.389
I'm gonna kiss it better.

57:12.622 --> 57:16.490
Luvlee, I presume.
I recognize the perfume.

57:16.559 --> 57:20.017
Can I offer you some pie?
It's not homemade, but it's decent.

57:20.097 --> 57:21.223
No, thank you.

57:21.298 --> 57:24.233
Probably gotta watch your figure,
your line of work.

57:24.301 --> 57:27.600
Nice name, by the way. Luvlee Lemons.

57:27.672 --> 57:31.665
I don't dance anymore.
I was never very good at it.

57:35.413 --> 57:40.248
Please tell me you're not waving
your hand in front of my face.

57:40.319 --> 57:43.288
Sorry. Have you been blind
your whole life?

57:43.355 --> 57:45.983
- Most of it, yeah.
- How'd it happen?

57:46.059 --> 57:49.722
- I looked at the sun too long.
- Wow. You hear about that...

57:49.796 --> 57:52.492
Let me ask you a question.
What's your real name?

57:52.566 --> 57:56.263
- Why? Are you gonna Google me?
- I did, what would I find?

57:56.337 --> 58:00.330
- Probably nothing.
- And what happens if I Google Gary?

58:00.408 --> 58:02.035
How'd you meet Chris?

58:02.109 --> 58:04.669
Center put us together
a few years ago.

58:04.746 --> 58:07.476
- Now he's your best friend?
- He's a good friend.

58:07.549 --> 58:09.813
Maybe your only friend, huh?

58:09.885 --> 58:11.944
That thing I said about the sun?

58:12.020 --> 58:15.512
That's a lie. Total bullshit.
I was about your age.

58:15.592 --> 58:19.153
Some buddies and me wanted to make
money, so we started a meth lab.

58:19.229 --> 58:22.392
- You blew yourself up?
- Do I look like I blew myself up?

58:22.466 --> 58:26.334
No, I didn't blow myself up.

58:26.403 --> 58:30.601
This was a while back,
before meth was fashionable,

58:30.674 --> 58:32.835
so unfortunately it wasn't yet known

58:32.911 --> 58:35.436
that if you work
in an unventilated room,

58:35.513 --> 58:37.845
the fumes can
and, in fact, do blind you.

58:37.916 --> 58:39.907
It probably could have been avoided

58:39.985 --> 58:45.480
if I had just stopped and bothered
to ask a simple question:

58:45.558 --> 58:47.583
What am I doing here?

58:47.660 --> 58:52.996
That is a sad story.
I'm sorry... if it's true.

58:53.066 --> 58:57.935
Tell me, what are you all cooking,
sweetheart? Why are you here?

58:58.005 --> 59:01.065
The same reason you are. Chris Pratt.

59:01.142 --> 59:05.374
Sweet. Of course,
not as sweet as meeting in a bar.

59:05.446 --> 59:08.882
- Or giving somebody a cell phone.
- Gary wants to help Chris.

59:08.951 --> 59:11.181
- I'll bet he does.
- Do you know Gary?

59:11.253 --> 59:13.244
I've known lots of Garys.

59:13.322 --> 59:15.381
- A few Luvlees, too.
- Meaning?

59:15.457 --> 59:18.688
Meaning something tells me
that you really don't believe

59:18.762 --> 59:22.095
you're going to be invited
to the next Pratt Thanksgiving.

59:22.165 --> 59:25.259
I could be.

59:25.335 --> 59:29.066
Sometimes I wake up and think I can see
until I walk into a door.

59:30.474 --> 59:34.501
The Luvlee Lemons of this world
do not end up with Chris Pratt.

59:35.513 --> 59:37.606
Thank you.

59:37.683 --> 59:39.776
- Asshole.
- Sad but true.

59:39.851 --> 59:44.220
But that brings me back
to that original question, Luvlee.

59:44.289 --> 59:49.818
So tonight, in the dark,
I'm gonna help you out and ask it again.

59:50.930 --> 59:53.922
What are you doing here?

01:00:03.644 --> 01:00:05.509
[phone rings]

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.707
- [Gary] Yeah.
- [Chris] The money's here.

01:00:07.782 --> 01:00:11.309
[Gary] That's good news.
We go tomorrow.

01:00:13.555 --> 01:00:16.820
[honking]

01:00:29.406 --> 01:00:32.500
Sorry I'm late.
I had to run down to the hospital.

01:00:32.576 --> 01:00:34.806
Sherry thought
she was going into labor.

01:00:34.879 --> 01:00:38.713
It was these weird fake contractions.

01:00:38.783 --> 01:00:42.913
I don't really understand. Anyway,
I wanted to stop by on our way home.

01:00:44.223 --> 01:00:47.989
- Oh, I'm fine, thanks.
- Cool. See you tomorrow night.

01:00:49.094 --> 01:00:51.085
Hey, Ted.

01:00:51.931 --> 01:00:55.298
You don't always have to come by
and check up on the bank.

01:00:55.368 --> 01:00:58.166
You think I come by here
to check up on the bank?

01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:01.503
I come by here to check up on you,
make sure you're OK.

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:06.979
Yeah, well... if I need a doughnut,
I can get my own.

01:01:07.048 --> 01:01:10.643
I sure as shit don't need you
feeling sorry for me.

01:01:10.719 --> 01:01:13.415
- You know.
- I know.

01:02:45.257 --> 01:02:48.590
This whole Earl of Sandwich thing
is revisionist bullshit.

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:51.993
Nobody invented the sandwich
any more than mashed potatoes.

01:02:52.063 --> 01:02:55.658
- Want me to read you the menu?
- Why? I order the same damn thing.

01:02:55.735 --> 01:02:59.432
- So you know what you want?
- What I always have. Teriyaki burger.

01:02:59.505 --> 01:03:03.202
I'll tell you what, Chris,
we have our place, no menus.

01:03:03.277 --> 01:03:05.939
Server comes up to the table,
brings ice water,

01:03:06.013 --> 01:03:08.311
tells you what's cooking that day.

01:03:08.382 --> 01:03:11.943
That'll be great.
Especially for our blind customers.

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:15.353
- I'm sorry, sightless.
- OK, what can I get you guys?

01:03:15.423 --> 01:03:18.551
For starters,
I'll take the name of your perfume.

01:03:18.626 --> 01:03:20.992
- It's Obsession.
- Consider me obsessed.

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:24.396
- The teriyaki burger.
- Medium well, extra teri on the side.

01:03:24.466 --> 01:03:25.797
And two Cokes.

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:28.803
Tell me, gorgeous,
is it hot in here or is it just you?

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:31.806
- You two are trouble, I can tell.
- Who, us? No.

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:35.777
- We're just having a gimps' night out.
- I'll get your drinks.

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:38.006
- She sounds cute.
- Why'd you say that?

01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:40.549
- Because she sounds cute.
- Gimps' night out?

01:03:40.618 --> 01:03:45.055
- What, you don't think she noticed?
- I can do any fucking thing I want to.

01:03:45.122 --> 01:03:47.920
And it's not even
night out either, stupid.

01:03:47.992 --> 01:03:49.983
I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you?

01:03:50.062 --> 01:03:52.997
The way you talk to people sometimes,
it's obnoxious.

01:03:53.065 --> 01:03:56.660
- How do I talk to people?
- That waitress, the way you hit on her.

01:03:56.735 --> 01:04:00.728
Come on. I've been turned down more
times than the beds at the Holiday Inn.

01:04:00.807 --> 01:04:03.799
- That doesn't keep me from trying.
- Has it ever worked?

01:04:03.876 --> 01:04:05.867
Think that waitress is thinking,

01:04:05.945 --> 01:04:09.005
"I wanna bone that blind guy,
looks like Larry Flynt."

01:04:09.083 --> 01:04:12.814
- Larry Flynt? Oh, Jesus.
- I'm moving out.

01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:24.521
Do you wanna know when?

01:04:26.636 --> 01:04:29.264
Sure.

01:04:29.338 --> 01:04:33.069
- When?
- I don't know. But soon.

01:04:33.142 --> 01:04:36.168
Here we are, gentlemen. And enjoy.

01:04:36.246 --> 01:04:38.441
Just bring the check.

01:04:38.515 --> 01:04:41.746
- You're kidding, right?
- Just bring the check.

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:05.401
Wait.

01:05:27.836 --> 01:05:29.827
Go ahead.

01:05:44.188 --> 01:05:46.179
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:59.496
Don't think I haven't noticed.
I've been watching you.

01:05:59.572 --> 01:06:02.063
The new clothes,
the way you've been acting.

01:06:02.141 --> 01:06:05.201
I'm not a fool, Chris.

01:06:05.277 --> 01:06:07.905
I found this in my drawer.

01:06:10.751 --> 01:06:13.811
And I realized
you've come a long way since then

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:17.015
and that perhaps
I've been a little unfair.

01:06:17.090 --> 01:06:21.288
After the holidays we'll get you
some regular time behind the window.

01:06:21.362 --> 01:06:25.162
After all, Mrs. Lange
isn't gonna be around forever.

01:06:25.233 --> 01:06:27.224
Good night, Chris.

01:06:34.243 --> 01:06:36.973
Oh, and don't forget to lock the door.

01:07:07.146 --> 01:07:10.172
[ringing]

01:07:10.249 --> 01:07:13.980
- [Lewis] Hello.
- Lewis, it's me. I really messed up.

01:07:14.054 --> 01:07:16.614
I don't know why,
but I said I would do it.

01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:19.488
They're gonna be here soon,
and I don't wanna do it anymore.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.427
- What?
- I really wanted to tell you before.

01:07:22.496 --> 01:07:27.365
Look, I'll be home in an hour. Whatever
mess you made, I'll clean it up.

01:07:27.435 --> 01:07:29.926
I'm not at home, I'm at the bank...

01:07:35.444 --> 01:07:37.139
Hey.

01:07:37.213 --> 01:07:39.374
Gary.

01:07:39.448 --> 01:07:43.248
I can't do this. You guys do
whatever you want, I won't say anything,

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.720
but I'm just not gonna do it.

01:07:48.158 --> 01:07:52.527
I understand. Tell you what,
why don't you go home, relax,

01:07:52.597 --> 01:07:55.031
and we'll just send you a check.

01:07:58.169 --> 01:08:01.195
Now go in there, get your mop,

01:08:01.273 --> 01:08:04.401
do your job and shut your fucking mouth.

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:12.038
[jackhammer rattling]

01:08:51.595 --> 01:08:53.586
Deputy Doughnut.

01:09:06.612 --> 01:09:10.173
That's a gun. Just know it's there.

01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:12.240
But talk to him like normal.

01:09:23.965 --> 01:09:24.953
Go.

01:09:29.002 --> 01:09:30.435
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey.

01:09:30.504 --> 01:09:32.529
- Cold out, huh?
- Yeah, I guess.

01:09:32.607 --> 01:09:36.566
Starting tomorrow, Phillip Costello's
gonna be taking over my shift.

01:09:36.645 --> 01:09:39.478
- How come?
- You forget? Baby?

01:09:39.548 --> 01:09:42.073
Yeah.

01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:44.812
Anyway, I just wanted you to know.

01:09:46.322 --> 01:09:47.618
Hey, Ted.

01:09:49.725 --> 01:09:52.559
I'm sorry about the other night,
what I said.

01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:56.930
Forget it. I know you can't help it.
I'll see you later.

01:10:09.981 --> 01:10:11.972
Very nice.

01:10:23.697 --> 01:10:27.793
[helicopter whirring]

01:11:25.432 --> 01:11:26.956
[Marty] Oh, man.

01:11:29.136 --> 01:11:32.537
Put your fucking gloves back on.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.867
Chris.

01:11:46.889 --> 01:11:48.880
OK. OK.

01:11:59.002 --> 01:12:00.993
Go and get it.

01:12:44.052 --> 01:12:46.953
- That's all of it.
- You can bring the car around back.

01:12:47.022 --> 01:12:48.853
[engine sputters]

01:12:50.426 --> 01:12:52.417
Go.

01:13:15.653 --> 01:13:16.881
Car.

01:13:17.857 --> 01:13:19.848
Don't move.

01:13:24.496 --> 01:13:26.487
Shit. Cop.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.932
- Jesus! It's Deputy Doughnut.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:48.614
Chris?

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.020
[Ted] Chris! You in there?

01:14:10.447 --> 01:14:11.436
Chris!

01:14:33.974 --> 01:14:35.942
[pager beeping]

01:14:36.009 --> 01:14:38.500
Oh, God.

01:14:49.023 --> 01:14:50.684
Oh, fuck.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.244
Move away from the wall!
Put your hands on your head!

01:15:12.316 --> 01:15:17.117
Don't think! Just do it!
Who's the shotgun? Who's the shotgun?

01:15:17.188 --> 01:15:19.247
- Ted?
- Don't you fucking move!

01:15:19.324 --> 01:15:22.350
- It's me.
- Shut up! Put your hands on your...

01:15:22.427 --> 01:15:25.362
Ted, there's another one!
There's another...

01:15:28.401 --> 01:15:30.392
Help me.

01:15:31.771 --> 01:15:33.762
Help him, Bone.

01:16:18.456 --> 01:16:19.946
Chris!

01:16:20.658 --> 01:16:22.148
Chris!

01:16:22.794 --> 01:16:25.160
Chris!

01:16:25.230 --> 01:16:27.425
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:16:27.499 --> 01:16:29.729
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:17:27.398 --> 01:17:30.595
- [siren blares]
- No.

01:17:49.257 --> 01:17:51.919
License and registration, please.

01:17:54.595 --> 01:17:59.623
- You were driving with your lights off.
- Just because of the fucking fireflies.

01:17:59.701 --> 01:18:02.261
- Excuse me?
- I just wanted to show her...

01:18:02.337 --> 01:18:04.828
I wanted to see her face...

01:18:05.841 --> 01:18:09.140
I'm in so much trouble.
They all died, and it's my fault.

01:18:09.212 --> 01:18:11.373
- Take it easy.
- They're gonna kill me.

01:18:13.116 --> 01:18:14.674
- Chris Pratt.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:16.554 --> 01:18:19.614
Go on home. Whatever it is
you think they're mad at,

01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:22.124
probably isn't as bad
as you think it is.

01:18:22.193 --> 01:18:25.128
- You want me to follow you?
- No.

01:18:25.197 --> 01:18:27.188
Good night, then.

01:19:54.028 --> 01:19:56.019
[dialing cell phone]

01:19:57.798 --> 01:19:59.459
- [Lewis] Hello.
- Are you OK?

01:19:59.534 --> 01:20:03.231
- I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?
- Because the lights are on.

01:20:03.305 --> 01:20:06.433
- They're up there, aren't they?
- Just get out of here. [grunts]

01:20:06.508 --> 01:20:09.272
[Gary] Come on up here,
and we can figure this out.

01:20:09.345 --> 01:20:12.143
- You're gonna shoot me.
- I just wanna talk to you.

01:20:12.214 --> 01:20:17.618
There's a camera in the vault. There's
a shovel and some bags in this car.

01:20:17.688 --> 01:20:20.714
You're gonna kill me
and bury me somewhere.

01:20:20.791 --> 01:20:23.453
- You're gonna blame the whole thing...
- [door opens]

01:21:13.549 --> 01:21:15.881
A good teller is primarily
a good counter.

01:21:20.289 --> 01:21:22.519
My friend would like to buy you a drink.

01:21:26.497 --> 01:21:29.557
I'll say it again.
Maybe you'll write it down this time.

01:21:29.633 --> 01:21:31.897
Whoever has the money has the power.

01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:43.644
Start at the end. Can't tell a story
if you don't know where it's going.

01:23:11.946 --> 01:23:13.504
[inhaler hisses]

01:23:13.581 --> 01:23:16.243
Fucker shot me through and through.

01:23:19.455 --> 01:23:21.355
[phone rings]

01:23:21.423 --> 01:23:24.722
Where you been, Christopher?

01:23:24.794 --> 01:23:26.853
- Hiding the money.
- What?

01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:30.229
I'll meet you at six o'clock
at the mayor's Christmas tree.

01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:33.667
That's over an hour away.
Where the fuck are you and the money?

01:23:33.738 --> 01:23:37.868
I'm gonna pick up Lewis. Once we're
safe, I'll tell you where the money is.

01:23:37.942 --> 01:23:40.934
No, no. Now, listen to me.
The bank is a mess.

01:23:41.012 --> 01:23:45.472
We all gotta get out of here, that
includes you. I can help you with that.

01:23:45.551 --> 01:23:49.282
I get caught, I'll take my chances.
They might not even believe me.

01:23:49.354 --> 01:23:52.380
It's not your life
that you're taking a chance with.

01:23:52.458 --> 01:23:56.019
Now, Bone will cut this blind
piece of shit right up the middle.

01:23:56.095 --> 01:23:58.586
- No, he won't.
- Yes, he will.

01:23:58.665 --> 01:24:00.656
- I have the power.
- What?

01:24:00.734 --> 01:24:04.500
I have the money, which means I have
the power, right? I have the power.

01:24:04.572 --> 01:24:06.540
- Just listen.
- No, you listen to me.

01:24:06.607 --> 01:24:11.340
Six o'clock. The mayor's Christmas tree.
I have the money. I have the power.

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:13.938
I have the power. Six o'clock.

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:16.677
And Lewis better not have a mark on him.

01:25:51.756 --> 01:25:55.248
- Kelly?
- It's about time.

01:25:58.798 --> 01:26:02.063
I wondered when you were gonna
get up your nerve to say hello.

01:26:02.135 --> 01:26:06.071
- I wanted to. I've been wanting to.
- I miss you.

01:26:07.874 --> 01:26:09.739
I miss talking to you.

01:26:11.312 --> 01:26:13.337
You're not mad at me anymore?

01:26:16.217 --> 01:26:19.311
You've never seen it, you know.
You wanna see it?

01:26:19.387 --> 01:26:20.513
See what?

01:26:37.874 --> 01:26:39.603
It's a part of me now.

01:26:54.359 --> 01:26:55.587
Sit down.

01:26:58.698 --> 01:27:01.098
- Where is it?
- He says he doesn't remember.

01:27:01.167 --> 01:27:04.102
- Lewis, are you OK?
- I'm terrific.

01:27:04.170 --> 01:27:07.196
Don't do this, Chris.
Just tell me where it is.

01:27:07.274 --> 01:27:09.401
- I don't know where it is.
- Bullshit.

01:27:11.445 --> 01:27:14.539
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- [groaning]

01:27:14.615 --> 01:27:16.742
Jesus Christ.

01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:23.155
Get up.

01:27:25.661 --> 01:27:27.652
What? Huh?

01:27:30.533 --> 01:27:33.229
I know. You wanna kill me.

01:27:33.302 --> 01:27:35.998
I've gotta kill Bone first.

01:27:38.708 --> 01:27:42.474
I'm standing here asking myself,
you know,

01:27:42.546 --> 01:27:45.071
"Is he really that dumb?"

01:27:45.149 --> 01:27:47.140
Fuck you!

01:27:48.152 --> 01:27:51.781
Or, you know, "Is he really that smart?"

01:27:59.531 --> 01:28:04.059
He don't remember.
He doesn't remember.

01:28:10.577 --> 01:28:13.774
Where's your notebook, huh?

01:28:13.848 --> 01:28:17.011
Where's your little notebook?
Where is it? Is it in here?

01:28:17.084 --> 01:28:20.383
Here it is. What's this?

01:28:24.793 --> 01:28:28.889
You know,
all those shitty-ass farm girls,

01:28:28.964 --> 01:28:31.159
you know, they all look alike.

01:28:31.234 --> 01:28:35.034
There's only one
that you'll remember, right?

01:28:39.041 --> 01:28:42.169
Bone, he buried it. He's buried it.

01:28:42.246 --> 01:28:45.875
Well, you know, let's go and dig it up.
Come on. Come on.

01:29:14.214 --> 01:29:18.651
You know, there was a three-
or four-day period in this whole thing,

01:29:18.719 --> 01:29:22.120
I just thought we could,
you know, leave you behind.

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:28.657
I thought if it all went well,
you could go back to your life.

01:29:31.667 --> 01:29:33.965
Such as it was.

01:30:06.405 --> 01:30:07.895
[strained panting]

01:30:07.974 --> 01:30:10.306
Throw it up. Now.

01:30:22.824 --> 01:30:24.291
Bring up the other one.

01:30:57.828 --> 01:30:59.796
It's getting warmer, huh?

01:30:59.865 --> 01:31:03.824
You have to come over here now.
Come on.

01:31:23.624 --> 01:31:25.615
[shotgun cocking]

01:31:38.407 --> 01:31:41.069
[Lewis] Am I dead?

01:31:41.877 --> 01:31:43.868
[panting]

01:31:45.114 --> 01:31:48.208
I must be. No one's talking to me.

01:31:48.285 --> 01:31:50.276
- You're not dead.
- Oh! Praise Jesus.

01:31:50.353 --> 01:31:52.344
Stay put.

01:32:05.104 --> 01:32:07.299
[strained breathing]

01:32:09.775 --> 01:32:11.902
Did you really forget?

01:32:22.388 --> 01:32:24.447
[wheezing]

01:32:27.328 --> 01:32:29.626
[Chris] Once upon a time, I woke up

01:32:29.697 --> 01:32:34.066
and I robbed the Noel Town Bank.

01:32:34.136 --> 01:32:36.536
I returned the money
and confessed my part,

01:32:36.605 --> 01:32:38.937
but in the end the FBI
decided that someone like me

01:32:39.007 --> 01:32:42.568
could never pull off
something like that.

01:32:42.645 --> 01:32:45.637
Marty cut the phone line
instead of the video feed,

01:32:45.715 --> 01:32:49.207
so the whole thing
was caught on the bank cameras.

01:32:55.993 --> 01:33:01.124
I still go to class, and they tell me my
sequencing is getting better, and I...

01:33:01.199 --> 01:33:03.827
Oh, wait. The restaurant.

01:33:05.403 --> 01:33:07.030
Mr. Tuttle gave us the loan.

01:33:07.105 --> 01:33:08.800
You gave me a dollar too much.

01:33:08.873 --> 01:33:11.535
He comes in once in a while for lunch.

01:33:20.353 --> 01:33:22.981
I started skating again.

01:33:23.056 --> 01:33:26.219
I'm not as good as I used to be,
but I'm OK.

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:36.295
What happened that night on old Route 24
is a part of me now.

01:33:38.373 --> 01:33:41.638
I just hope that one day
Kelly will be ready to see me again

01:33:41.710 --> 01:33:45.942
and I can finally tell her what
I've only been able to say in my dreams.

01:33:46.748 --> 01:33:51.117
Until then all I can do is wake up,

01:33:51.187 --> 01:33:53.678
take a shower with soap,

01:33:53.756 --> 01:33:55.883
and try to forgive myself.

01:33:55.959 --> 01:34:00.328
And if I can do that,
then maybe others will forgive me, too.

01:34:02.633 --> 01:34:06.069
I don't know if that will happen.

01:34:06.137 --> 01:34:09.470
I guess I'll just have to
work backwards from there.
