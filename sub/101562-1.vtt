M_I_SForEver

01:09.400 --> 01:13.504
Well, I guess we
gotta find another one.

04:19.990 --> 04:20.992
Hemingway.

04:22.192 --> 04:23.026
You a fan?

04:23.994 --> 04:26.163
- He was a genius...
- But?

04:27.129 --> 04:29.165
Too much of a cheesemo for me.

04:29.199 --> 04:30.668
If we're talking authors
who killed themselves,

04:30.701 --> 04:32.069
I'll take Virginia Wolfe.

04:33.235 --> 04:34.805
Did my other book come in yet?

04:34.838 --> 04:36.173
Yes, um...

04:37.641 --> 04:39.109
Here you go.

04:39.141 --> 04:41.011
Hope you don't mind
I read some of it.

04:41.043 --> 04:43.313
Kinda bad about that,
I can't help myself.

04:43.346 --> 04:45.114
What'd you think?

04:45.148 --> 04:46.951
Pretty fascinating stuff.

04:46.983 --> 04:49.353
Like the old tales of
people turning into wolves

04:49.386 --> 04:52.689
and town drunkards
stealing chickens

04:52.723 --> 04:55.192
and losing their minds
at the full moons.

04:55.225 --> 04:56.961
They are probably
just mentally ill.

04:56.994 --> 04:58.128
How do you know?

04:58.161 --> 04:59.797
I guess I can't know for sure,

04:59.829 --> 05:02.132
but I don't really believe
in supernatural stuff.

05:02.165 --> 05:04.201
Maybe what some
consider supernatural

05:04.233 --> 05:07.637
is simply unexplained
scientific phenomenon.

05:07.670 --> 05:09.072
Now we're talking.

05:09.105 --> 05:10.040
Here's for both.

05:10.072 --> 05:10.974
Keep the change.

05:11.007 --> 05:12.075
Lisa, right?

05:12.108 --> 05:12.875
Yeah.

05:12.908 --> 05:14.278
Um, thanks.

05:14.310 --> 05:17.281
I was sorry to hear
about your grandmother.

05:18.382 --> 05:19.382
Thanks, Miss Stoddard.

05:19.415 --> 05:21.918
Please, just Mary.

05:21.951 --> 05:23.219
Thanks for coming in, Mary.

05:32.862 --> 05:33.798
Hi, Mary.

05:37.199 --> 05:39.135
You dropped your books.

05:42.439 --> 05:43.240
Oh shit.

05:47.310 --> 05:49.012
Always good to
see you, sweetie.

05:57.788 --> 05:59.055
Okay, everybody.

05:59.088 --> 06:00.790
It's closing time.

06:00.824 --> 06:01.859
What the hell?

06:01.891 --> 06:03.427
What's up, bitch?

06:03.459 --> 06:06.697
Jessica Huckins,
immature as ever.

06:06.730 --> 06:08.265
Could you please leave?

06:08.298 --> 06:09.932
But I'm looking for a book.

06:09.966 --> 06:10.768
I didn't know you could read.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.336
Oh, Lisa.

06:12.369 --> 06:14.372
Always the wittiest
one in the room.

06:20.177 --> 06:21.212
Think this'll do nicely.

06:22.946 --> 06:25.249
Fahrenheit 451.

06:25.281 --> 06:27.350
I don't think you'll
understand it.

06:27.384 --> 06:29.218
I'm not gonna read it.

06:29.252 --> 06:30.754
I'm gonna burn it.

06:32.154 --> 06:34.390
I really wish you could
get the irony of that.

06:34.423 --> 06:35.225
You better not.

06:37.360 --> 06:38.229
You're no fun.

06:39.230 --> 06:40.831
Why doesn't it surprise
me that burning books

06:40.863 --> 06:42.265
is your idea of fun?

06:42.298 --> 06:44.168
Hey, Lisa.

06:44.201 --> 06:45.302
Why'd you come back?

06:46.036 --> 06:48.237
Everyone was so
happy when you left.

06:48.271 --> 06:50.140
Her grandma, girl.

06:50.173 --> 06:54.244
So what, she dies
and leaves you all this?

06:54.276 --> 06:57.313
Yep, she went and got
some fancy degree overseas

06:57.346 --> 07:00.283
and now you're right
back where you started.

07:01.151 --> 07:02.052
What a waste.

07:03.220 --> 07:05.355
I like the movie, maybe
I'll like the book.

07:05.387 --> 07:06.456
What do you think?

07:06.490 --> 07:07.324
Fits you.

07:08.992 --> 07:10.694
For $200 you can take it home.

07:11.862 --> 07:13.263
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

07:13.295 --> 07:14.964
It's a first edition.

07:14.997 --> 07:16.300
Sure.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.736
Tell you what, I'm
just gonna take it.

07:18.769 --> 07:19.903
No, you're not.

07:19.935 --> 07:20.837
Yes, I am.

07:22.404 --> 07:23.274
Later, bitch.

07:27.009 --> 07:28.344
Don't, Lisa.

07:28.377 --> 07:29.413
It's easier this way.

07:50.033 --> 07:53.836
This is nothing a spirited
beverage or two can't conquer.

07:53.870 --> 07:55.038
Also our friend MJ.

07:56.338 --> 07:58.408
All right, two beers.

07:59.475 --> 08:00.543
Do you know what you wanna eat?

08:00.576 --> 08:02.178
We will take a
veggie thin crust.

08:02.211 --> 08:03.880
Oh, you got it.

08:03.913 --> 08:04.748
Thanks, Emma.

08:09.084 --> 08:10.454
- Thanks, Emma.
- Shut up!

08:13.423 --> 08:15.326
God, that book was expensive.

08:16.492 --> 08:18.394
It's not even like
I can report it.

08:19.195 --> 08:21.230
Yeah, her mother
won't do anything

08:21.264 --> 08:23.033
to mommy's little
country princess.

08:24.134 --> 08:26.470
She didn't even do anything
when Gretchen went missing,

08:26.503 --> 08:28.105
she's not gonna give
a shit about a book.

08:28.138 --> 08:30.574
Maybe I can go to
the state police.

08:30.606 --> 08:32.842
There's gotta be somebody
above her somewhere.

08:35.846 --> 08:39.515
Tell you what, later on
we'll slash Jessica's tires.

08:39.548 --> 08:41.884
They've gotta be worth the
same as the book, right?

08:41.918 --> 08:43.519
Probably would make
me feel a little better.

08:43.552 --> 08:44.388
So will this.

08:47.423 --> 08:49.225
To Northbrook, where
the Huckins clan

08:49.259 --> 08:50.827
and all eligible
bachelors are scum.

08:50.860 --> 08:54.163
I don't need a man,
I practice self-love.

08:54.197 --> 08:56.365
Oh, don't we all?

08:56.399 --> 08:57.433
To self-love then.

08:57.466 --> 08:59.269
To self-love.

09:04.106 --> 09:05.509
I know, I know.

09:06.909 --> 09:08.044
I can't, you see.

09:10.614 --> 09:12.316
But what if?

09:12.349 --> 09:13.483
- Right?
- Fun?

09:13.515 --> 09:16.552
Where will we go?

09:34.537 --> 09:35.973
You want a special cookie?

09:38.575 --> 09:39.410
Morgan.

09:40.976 --> 09:43.947
We're going to kill you, Morgan.

09:44.614 --> 09:45.449
Morgan.

09:46.548 --> 09:49.151
Morgan.

09:49.184 --> 09:50.019
Morgan.

09:54.658 --> 09:56.894
Dude, they jacked up his ride.

09:56.927 --> 09:59.997
Are you here, Morgan?

10:00.029 --> 10:00.865
Morgan.

10:02.532 --> 10:05.201
Are you here, Morgan?

10:05.235 --> 10:06.604
But you live to do all this.

10:08.071 --> 10:08.939
Do you know why?

10:10.440 --> 10:11.575
Perhaps I was chosen.

10:20.582 --> 10:21.517
You're freaks.

10:22.485 --> 10:23.620
I'm a man.

10:25.154 --> 10:26.189
The last man.

10:29.525 --> 10:31.160
Not Dr. Robert.

10:31.193 --> 10:34.130
- Robert!
- He does everything he can.

10:34.163 --> 10:36.198
They
were afraid of me.

10:36.231 --> 10:37.934
This was
different in the book.

10:37.967 --> 10:39.502
They were afraid of me.

10:54.683 --> 10:55.685
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:03.759 --> 11:05.696
Don't forget to love yourself.

11:05.729 --> 11:08.432
Oh, don't forget
to dream of Vincent.

11:08.465 --> 11:10.000
Oh, no thank you.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.436
Bye.

11:47.604 --> 11:49.172
Oh, shit.

12:26.775 --> 12:28.044
Hey, bitch.

12:29.479 --> 12:31.314
What do you want, Jessica?

12:31.346 --> 12:32.749
Brought your book back.

12:32.782 --> 12:34.151
This isn't a library.

12:35.384 --> 12:36.153
I know.

12:36.186 --> 12:37.687
I know, I suck.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.355
How can I make it up to you?

12:39.389 --> 12:41.191
You could stop
calling me bitch.

12:41.224 --> 12:42.725
Consider it done.

12:42.759 --> 12:44.760
You could apologize
for once in your life.

12:44.793 --> 12:46.629
I am sorry, Lisa.

12:48.630 --> 12:50.466
Look, I know it's not enough.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.568
How about we hang out sometime?

12:52.601 --> 12:54.303
I'll be nice, I promise.

12:55.370 --> 12:56.438
What are you on?

12:56.471 --> 12:59.643
Come on, we'll drive all
the way out to Kansas City,

12:59.676 --> 13:00.811
I'll take you to
that art museum.

13:00.844 --> 13:02.813
Seems like something you'd like.

13:02.846 --> 13:05.749
It is, but not with you.

13:08.650 --> 13:09.485
Wow.

13:10.753 --> 13:12.723
You have never
liked me, have you?

13:14.823 --> 13:15.658
Why would I?

13:17.259 --> 13:21.697
Listen, Lisa, can I bare
my soul to you just a little?

13:21.730 --> 13:23.299
Not possible.

13:23.332 --> 13:24.168
I, uh...

13:25.301 --> 13:27.704
There's just something
I wanna tell you.

13:27.736 --> 13:29.338
God, what?

13:29.371 --> 13:30.740
This.

13:30.773 --> 13:32.242
What the hell are you doing?

13:32.274 --> 13:33.643
What?

13:33.676 --> 13:35.579
You and Sam all
through high school.

13:35.611 --> 13:37.313
She's my best
friend, you idiot.

13:39.581 --> 13:41.884
What the hell is
the matter with you?

13:41.918 --> 13:44.354
You wanna know what I
think about you, Lisa?

13:49.658 --> 13:51.595
You gonna cry now?

13:51.628 --> 13:53.129
Don't flatter yourself.

13:53.163 --> 13:54.298
It's too bad.

13:56.732 --> 13:58.301
Tears give me a hard on.

14:00.403 --> 14:01.238
Fuck you.

14:01.904 --> 14:04.473
No, Lisa. Fuck you.

14:04.506 --> 14:06.509
Get out of here
and leave me alone.

14:09.511 --> 14:10.379
Wrong move.

14:46.582 --> 14:48.851
What other choice
do I have, Sam?

14:48.884 --> 14:50.553
I know, it's just...

14:50.586 --> 14:52.855
This is Deb Huckins
we're talking about.

14:52.889 --> 14:54.624
If I don't do anything
Jessica's just gonna keep

14:54.657 --> 14:56.393
taking advantage of me.

14:56.426 --> 14:57.694
You want me to go with you?

14:57.726 --> 14:59.295
I can leave and meet you there.

15:00.730 --> 15:02.432
No.

15:02.465 --> 15:03.466
I got it.

15:03.499 --> 15:04.734
Thanks.

15:04.767 --> 15:05.669
Of course.

15:24.953 --> 15:25.788
Yep.

15:27.256 --> 15:28.691
The tree again?

15:28.725 --> 15:29.560
No.

15:30.559 --> 15:33.229
I said no, Mrs. Peterson.

15:33.263 --> 15:34.764
I can't come out
there and get your cat

15:34.797 --> 15:37.300
out of the god damn tree
every time it runs up there.

15:37.332 --> 15:38.769
Sheriff, this is important.

15:39.769 --> 15:42.905
Because it's a damn
cat, that's what they do.

15:42.938 --> 15:44.406
If I come out there
I'm gonna blow it

15:44.440 --> 15:45.842
to smithereens with my shotgun.

15:45.875 --> 15:48.778
Yeah, bye, Mrs. Peterson!

15:48.811 --> 15:49.646
Idiots.

15:51.780 --> 15:53.382
Okay, Lisa.

15:53.416 --> 15:54.317
What is it?

15:54.350 --> 15:56.220
Nick, start taking a report.

15:58.788 --> 16:02.392
Uh last week
Jessica came into my store

16:02.424 --> 16:06.262
with some of her friends
and she chased off all

16:06.296 --> 16:10.600
my customers and stole a rare
copy of "A Clockwork Orange".

16:11.833 --> 16:12.835
Heck of a book.

16:13.936 --> 16:14.971
Now, go on, devushka.

16:16.505 --> 16:19.875
Doesn't that constitute
theft, papushka?

16:21.878 --> 16:23.480
Where's the book now?

16:24.746 --> 16:26.515
That leads me to today.

16:27.716 --> 16:30.886
I was alone in the store and
she came back in with the book-

16:30.919 --> 16:32.355
- Oh, wait, hold on a second.

16:33.623 --> 16:35.325
She brought the book back.

16:37.059 --> 16:38.994
Well, yeah, but
that doesn't matter.

16:39.028 --> 16:40.430
She stole it.

16:40.462 --> 16:41.697
Well, maybe she just
thought you were running

16:41.730 --> 16:43.466
a little library or something.

16:45.768 --> 16:48.404
Sure, let's pretend
that makes sense.

16:49.872 --> 16:53.977
She brought the book back
and then she came onto me.

16:56.412 --> 16:58.382
Well, she has
good taste, Lisa.

16:59.749 --> 17:01.851
I'm serious, she
spit in my face.

17:01.884 --> 17:05.387
Well, nobody ever died
from a little spittle.

17:05.421 --> 17:07.089
She assaulted me.

17:07.123 --> 17:07.958
How?

17:08.857 --> 17:11.461
She kissed me and I didn't-

17:11.492 --> 17:13.061
- Hm, that's not assault.

17:13.096 --> 17:14.631
Then what do you call it?

17:14.663 --> 17:16.865
It's a kiss, dum dum.

17:16.897 --> 17:18.733
It's a kind gesture.

17:18.768 --> 17:20.569
It wasn't consensual.

17:20.603 --> 17:22.571
- That is textbook-
- Look, it is not assault

17:22.605 --> 17:23.973
if nobody got hit.

17:24.874 --> 17:26.375
Oh, that's bullshit.

17:26.409 --> 17:27.777
What do you think, Nick?

17:27.809 --> 17:29.578
It ain't assault
if nobody got hit.

17:29.612 --> 17:31.114
You got that right, ma.

17:31.146 --> 17:33.982
Learned that in the
academy the very first day.

17:34.016 --> 17:36.653
Besides, she's a good girl,
you ain't hurt or nothing.

17:36.685 --> 17:37.853
Why don't you just
let this one pass?

17:37.886 --> 17:39.056
Nick, stop the report.

17:40.923 --> 17:42.358
I knew it.

17:42.392 --> 17:43.393
You're not gonna do anything.

17:43.425 --> 17:46.862
Like I said, no harm no foul.

17:46.895 --> 17:48.630
There's no point to any of this.

17:48.663 --> 17:50.866
Okay, well I'm just
gonna take this to

17:50.900 --> 17:54.403
the county trash man or
whoever the hell has authority

17:54.436 --> 17:55.971
over you and tell them
what is going on here,

17:56.005 --> 17:58.441
so thanks for nothing.

17:58.473 --> 18:00.909
Now, that is no way to
talk to the town sheriff,

18:00.942 --> 18:02.511
is it, Lisa?

18:02.545 --> 18:05.048
You seem to have a bit
of an attitude problem.

18:05.080 --> 18:08.484
It sounds like disturbing
the peace there, Sheriff.

18:08.518 --> 18:09.652
You hear that?

18:09.684 --> 18:11.153
Disturbing the peace.

18:11.186 --> 18:13.490
How'd you like to spend
the night in jail?

18:14.490 --> 18:15.392
I didn't do anything.

18:15.424 --> 18:17.926
Disorderly conduct.

18:17.960 --> 18:18.961
- God.
- Hey.

18:19.862 --> 18:20.764
Let me go.

18:20.797 --> 18:22.098
Resisting arrest, too.

18:24.032 --> 18:26.068
She put her hands
on me too, Mom.

18:26.102 --> 18:27.070
Is that right?

18:28.904 --> 18:30.038
Well, maybe you're the one

18:30.071 --> 18:31.940
that committed
assault, huh, Lisa?

18:31.973 --> 18:35.477
Might have to lock you
up for a long time.

18:35.510 --> 18:36.379
Easy now.

18:50.792 --> 18:53.529
Did I ever tell you
about your grandma?

18:53.563 --> 18:56.900
She fucked her way
across the whole town.

18:56.932 --> 18:58.934
I'm surprised you
haven't followed suit.

19:19.788 --> 19:21.590
How's that for assault, sweetie?

19:24.559 --> 19:26.128
Please let me go.

19:26.162 --> 19:28.164
I promise I won't tell anybody.

19:29.199 --> 19:31.701
When I was a little girl
we had a dog named Otto.

19:31.733 --> 19:33.769
I loved that dog, but
he was stubborn as hell

19:33.803 --> 19:36.573
so my daddy beat the shit
out of him until he listened.

19:37.740 --> 19:39.075
Near as I can tell
you're just a bitch

19:39.107 --> 19:41.778
that needs to be taught
a very severe lesson.

19:43.778 --> 19:46.115
All right, Jess,
she's outta my hands.

19:46.147 --> 19:47.951
You know what to do.

19:47.983 --> 19:48.818
Right.

19:50.252 --> 19:52.489
I'm gonna enjoy this.

19:57.125 --> 19:59.095
Millie, you want in on this?

19:59.127 --> 20:00.996
No.

20:01.029 --> 20:02.531
Nick?

20:02.565 --> 20:04.801
It ain't worth
me scuffing up my boots.

20:33.729 --> 20:35.698
Think that's
enough of a lesson?

20:35.730 --> 20:38.501
No, she needs a
permanent reminder.

20:39.734 --> 20:40.836
Knock out a
couple of her teeth

20:40.869 --> 20:42.204
with a hammer and pliers.

20:42.238 --> 20:43.539
I'm sure Dr. Wilkins
could use the business

20:43.573 --> 20:45.675
for a pair of new dentures.

20:45.708 --> 20:46.810
You're sick.

20:47.943 --> 20:49.778
All right,
I'll take over.

20:49.811 --> 20:51.213
Not gonna happen.

20:51.247 --> 20:54.150
Don't think for one second
I won't cut your balls off.

20:55.617 --> 20:57.220
It does give me an idea.

20:57.252 --> 20:58.554
Give me your pliers, Nick.

21:00.122 --> 21:02.726
Everyone's gonna have to
hold her down for this one.

21:11.834 --> 21:12.635
Hey.

21:47.737 --> 21:50.840
Can't you idiots
do anything right?

21:50.873 --> 21:52.609
Now what
do we do with her?

21:52.642 --> 21:55.745
You take her car and
you sink it in the river.

21:55.778 --> 21:57.180
Go on and get on it.

21:57.212 --> 21:58.080
Right.

21:58.114 --> 22:02.218
Nick, you guys take
her out to the woods

22:03.249 --> 22:03.353
and feed her to the wolves.

22:03.385 --> 22:05.087
They prefer live game.

22:06.055 --> 22:06.890
Got it.

22:11.027 --> 22:14.698
And Nick, make sure
you finish the lesson.

22:52.268 --> 22:56.271
Well, good thing Jess
isn't here for this.

23:03.078 --> 23:03.913
Here.

26:32.488 --> 26:34.190
It's okay, Lisa.

26:34.222 --> 26:35.124
You're safe here.

26:37.459 --> 26:38.961
Where am I?

26:38.993 --> 26:39.895
My cottage.

26:41.696 --> 26:44.032
You remember me, right?

26:44.066 --> 26:44.901
Yeah.

26:47.068 --> 26:48.538
What were you dreaming about?

26:51.373 --> 26:52.241
Wolves.

26:55.044 --> 26:57.446
You got a nasty bite from one.

26:57.479 --> 27:01.217
Don't worry, I cleaned it out
for ya and bandaged you up.

27:05.487 --> 27:06.989
What time is it?

27:07.021 --> 27:08.625
Four o'clock in the afternoon.

27:10.159 --> 27:13.062
Been asleep for almost 10 hours.

27:17.298 --> 27:18.567
Do you remember anything?

27:23.739 --> 27:25.508
You're lucky you survived.

27:27.742 --> 27:29.144
Where is this cottage?

27:30.211 --> 27:32.682
A few miles outside
of High Mills.

27:32.714 --> 27:34.182
High Mills.

27:34.215 --> 27:35.550
I knew they took me north.

27:36.617 --> 27:37.452
They?

27:42.523 --> 27:45.694
You live in Northbrook, right?

27:45.728 --> 27:46.496
Yeah.

27:47.730 --> 27:48.664
Nice little town.

27:50.566 --> 27:51.733
Sheriff's a bitch.

27:54.502 --> 27:56.239
Can I get you something?

27:57.172 --> 27:58.473
Coffee? Water?

27:58.507 --> 28:00.142
Whiskey?

28:00.174 --> 28:01.644
That's tempting.

28:01.676 --> 28:03.645
I'll take water.

28:03.679 --> 28:06.516
Thank you for taking
care of me, Mary.

28:07.583 --> 28:08.618
Happy to help.

28:29.404 --> 28:30.740
Drink up.

28:30.772 --> 28:33.641
And then I think you
should get some more rest.

28:33.674 --> 28:35.144
I'll take you home later.

28:36.545 --> 28:38.181
- Or to the sheriff if-
- No.

28:42.683 --> 28:45.288
Get some more rest, I insist.

30:07.469 --> 30:09.471
Sorry about the clothes.

30:09.505 --> 30:11.507
No, it's okay.
I appreciate it.

30:17.679 --> 30:19.482
That's for my dog, Gus.

30:27.288 --> 30:30.425
Mary, could you
just take me home?

30:33.194 --> 30:34.163
Come on, let's go.

31:02.790 --> 31:04.726
Why don't you tell me
what really happened?

31:07.496 --> 31:08.431
I'd rather not.

31:09.932 --> 31:11.166
You can trust me.

31:16.771 --> 31:21.777
Uh, some people beat me
up and left me in the woods

31:23.744 --> 31:26.148
and I don't want them
to know I'm alive.

31:27.848 --> 31:28.884
Beat you up?

31:33.221 --> 31:36.825
Look, you saved my life
and I'll never be able

31:36.857 --> 31:38.826
to thank you enough for that.

31:38.859 --> 31:39.828
You're welcome.

33:23.999 --> 33:26.302
Where the hell have you been?

33:26.335 --> 33:28.403
I've been worried out
of my fricken mind.

33:37.511 --> 33:42.518
No bruises, no fractures
that I can see.

33:43.719 --> 33:44.487
There should be some
marks left behind.

33:45.653 --> 33:47.522
They ripped off two
of my fingernails.

33:47.556 --> 33:48.391
Look.

33:50.925 --> 33:53.594
Maybe you just
got a concussion

33:53.628 --> 33:55.364
and that didn't actually happen?

33:57.032 --> 33:57.867
Maybe.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.635
And they cut my forehead

34:01.802 --> 34:03.571
and it's gone like
it was never there.

34:07.608 --> 34:09.010
Just the bite wound
which is already

34:09.043 --> 34:10.413
healed for some reason.

34:12.681 --> 34:13.916
I don't get it.

34:15.483 --> 34:16.918
Can I stay with
you for awhile?

34:18.820 --> 34:20.056
I don't want them to find me.

34:21.088 --> 34:21.989
I guess.

34:24.860 --> 34:26.527
Of course!

34:26.561 --> 34:29.030
You should've moved in
with me when you came back.

34:59.994 --> 35:00.895
Stop!

35:05.934 --> 35:06.935
Did I hit him?

35:06.967 --> 35:08.002
Hide the weed.

35:12.474 --> 35:13.909
Are you okay?

35:13.942 --> 35:14.943
Yeah, I'm so sorry. I
didn't see you guys coming.

35:14.976 --> 35:16.612
No, it's okay,
we almost hit you.

35:18.447 --> 35:19.782
Hey, don't worry that

35:19.815 --> 35:21.083
- should be fine.
- Yeah, it's not that bad.

35:21.115 --> 35:23.652
My friend should be out in
a second, she's a nurse.

35:26.487 --> 35:28.656
Hey, what are you
doing? What are you doing?

35:28.690 --> 35:29.691
Hey, hey.

35:29.724 --> 35:30.860
- Let me go, let me go!
- Lisa!

35:35.664 --> 35:37.666
What was that all about?

35:49.543 --> 35:50.913
I just feel really weird.

35:53.949 --> 35:58.653
What the
hell is happening?

35:58.686 --> 36:01.155
Where are your
Clark Kent specs?

36:01.188 --> 36:04.460
They broke them and now I
can see just fine without them.

36:09.164 --> 36:10.766
You know what?

36:10.798 --> 36:12.134
I think we should be proactive.

36:13.101 --> 36:14.702
How?

36:32.920 --> 36:34.188
Sheriff, I need your help.

36:34.222 --> 36:35.891
We're on a break, Sam.

36:35.923 --> 36:37.492
Yeah, I know, I couldn't
find you at the station

36:37.525 --> 36:38.960
and I saw your car here.

36:38.994 --> 36:41.196
Well, it must be
an emergency then.

36:41.228 --> 36:43.998
Yeah, I can't find my
friend Lisa anywhere.

36:44.032 --> 36:45.968
She's not at home, she
hasn't opened her store.

36:46.001 --> 36:47.035
I can't find her car.

36:47.068 --> 36:49.538
It's like she just disappeared.

36:49.570 --> 36:51.072
You say her car's gone?

36:51.106 --> 36:52.975
Well, maybe she just
left town and like went

36:53.007 --> 36:55.143
on a little vacation
or something.

36:55.175 --> 36:56.744
She's not answering
her phone either,

36:56.777 --> 36:58.179
it just goes straight
to voicemail.

36:58.213 --> 37:00.516
Well, that is
strange, but these sorts

37:00.548 --> 37:02.050
of things happen all the time.

37:02.083 --> 37:03.952
I think it's best just
to wait a little bit.

37:03.985 --> 37:06.555
99 times out of 100
people just leave

37:06.588 --> 37:07.789
and then they show back up.

37:07.822 --> 37:10.125
She wouldn't leave
without contacting me.

37:10.157 --> 37:12.059
Can I fill out a missing
person report or something?

37:12.092 --> 37:14.596
No, it's questionable
if she's even missing-

37:14.628 --> 37:16.097
- So you're not even
gonna do anything?

37:16.130 --> 37:19.000
Look, don't get
your panty in a whirl.

37:21.168 --> 37:22.570
I'll tell you what we'll do.

37:23.438 --> 37:25.140
We'll go by her
apartment and the store,

37:25.172 --> 37:27.275
snoop around town a little
bit, see what we can turn up.

37:27.309 --> 37:28.544
That sound all right?

37:29.811 --> 37:30.646
Thanks.

37:32.012 --> 37:33.114
Run along now, Samantha.

37:40.989 --> 37:42.157
Did you leave her there?

37:42.190 --> 37:45.059
Left her in the
woods up in High Mill.

37:45.092 --> 37:47.695
Well, I figure the
wolves would eat her, or...

37:51.833 --> 37:52.867
Or maybe Dolphus might

37:52.900 --> 37:54.302
- put her in that little-
- Look, Ma.

37:54.335 --> 37:56.737
We both heard the wolves
closing in, all right?

37:56.771 --> 37:59.807
She is shitting in the
woods or that freak got her.

37:59.840 --> 38:00.675
We'll see.

38:06.981 --> 38:07.882
What's up?

38:07.916 --> 38:09.585
Yeah, is Millie with you?

38:09.617 --> 38:10.585
Put me on speaker.

38:13.288 --> 38:16.559
Will you two idiots turn off
the your games for two seconds?

38:20.094 --> 38:22.196
Lisa, Miss LaRoux
is a missing person

38:22.230 --> 38:24.733
and she is gonna stay a
missing person forever.

38:24.766 --> 38:26.233
You two idiots are
taking this to your grave

38:26.266 --> 38:28.069
or I'm gonna put you there
myself, you understand?

38:28.103 --> 38:29.104
Yeah,
Mom, we got it.

38:31.306 --> 38:34.041
Yeah, let's go
through the motions.

38:34.074 --> 38:35.243
Get your shit and let's go.

38:36.210 --> 38:37.945
Copy that, Mom.

38:46.153 --> 38:47.889
They're totally
playing it off.

38:47.922 --> 38:49.090
They say they're
gonna look for you

38:49.123 --> 38:51.292
but I don't think they
know you're alive.

38:51.326 --> 38:52.260
Thank god.

39:29.230 --> 39:30.065
What happened?

39:33.768 --> 39:34.769
You better find her.

39:36.137 --> 39:37.272
Or you gonna be a
little chicken shit

39:37.304 --> 39:38.940
like you were with Gretchen?

40:01.396 --> 40:03.365
Don't act like
you didn't like it.

40:22.382 --> 40:23.384
I heard you last night.

40:27.755 --> 40:28.356
Oh.

40:30.125 --> 40:30.992
How could I not?

40:31.925 --> 40:32.728
You need help.

40:35.362 --> 40:36.931
No, I don't.

40:36.965 --> 40:38.300
I can deal with this on my own.

40:39.768 --> 40:40.936
I'm worried about you.

40:45.306 --> 40:47.008
I just...

40:47.041 --> 40:48.443
I need to get out of the house,

40:48.476 --> 40:51.113
so I'm just gonna
go for a drive.

40:51.146 --> 40:52.514
Someone will see you, dipshit.

40:52.547 --> 40:55.317
I won't get out of my car
until I'm way out of town.

40:58.452 --> 40:59.288
Be careful.

42:49.496 --> 42:53.300
I'm sorry to keep you late,
but we gotta get this done.

42:53.333 --> 42:55.002
What do you wanna eat?

42:55.036 --> 42:56.403
I'm not hungry.

42:56.436 --> 42:58.539
Okay, I'll be back in a few.

43:34.309 --> 43:35.143
Jerry?

43:40.547 --> 43:41.515
Jerry, is that you?

44:05.639 --> 44:06.474
Oh my.

44:12.179 --> 44:13.014
Lisa.

44:13.715 --> 44:14.917
I'm so sorry.

44:16.351 --> 44:18.720
They shouldn't have
done that to you.

44:18.753 --> 44:20.055
You didn't deserve it.

44:31.465 --> 44:33.234
I didn't do anything.

44:35.235 --> 44:36.070
Exactly.

45:15.108 --> 45:16.677
Lisa?

45:16.710 --> 45:17.545
What happened?

45:31.559 --> 45:33.695
Millie Thompson,
I think I killed her.

45:38.199 --> 45:40.101
You think you
killed her? What?

45:40.768 --> 45:42.503
I...

45:42.536 --> 45:43.672
I couldn't stop myself.

45:45.773 --> 45:47.041
Did anyone see you?

45:47.074 --> 45:47.708
No.

45:49.476 --> 45:50.612
What's going on with you?

45:52.246 --> 45:54.016
What if they find
out it was you?

45:56.483 --> 45:58.686
I can't believe you
actually killed someone.

46:01.222 --> 46:02.057
Lisa, Lisa!

46:02.090 --> 46:02.691
What!

46:04.791 --> 46:06.661
What are we gonna do?

46:12.567 --> 46:14.436
I know what I'm gonna do.

46:24.612 --> 46:25.447
What?

46:27.748 --> 46:29.617
It's blowing up.

46:29.650 --> 46:31.552
Millie Thompson died
in the auto shop.

46:32.853 --> 46:34.056
Fuck.

46:35.188 --> 46:36.057
Lisa LaRoux.

46:37.224 --> 46:37.826
Killer?

46:39.659 --> 46:41.128
What the hell is happening?

46:41.161 --> 46:42.629
If you don't feel comfortable
with me staying here

46:42.663 --> 46:43.530
I can leave.

46:43.563 --> 46:45.567
What are you gonna
do? Live in the woods?

46:47.802 --> 46:50.405
No, but I know
someone who does.

47:10.757 --> 47:12.726
You're scaring off my
paying customers, Mom.

47:12.760 --> 47:13.595
You hear?

47:14.728 --> 47:16.364
About Millie?

47:16.396 --> 47:17.632
Yeah.

47:17.664 --> 47:18.800
It may of looked
like an accident,

47:18.833 --> 47:21.436
but I can guarantee
you it wasn't.

47:21.469 --> 47:22.269
Lisa.

47:22.302 --> 47:23.538
Damn straight.

47:23.570 --> 47:24.706
Gotta find her.

47:24.739 --> 47:27.641
Your brother and I are gonna
pay her friend a little visit.

47:27.675 --> 47:28.910
What do you want me to do?

47:28.943 --> 47:31.211
Take this, head
over to her place

47:31.244 --> 47:32.746
and see if she shows up there.

47:32.780 --> 47:33.782
Try not to fuck it up.

48:13.954 --> 48:16.490
Okay, I am Lisa.

48:20.494 --> 48:21.329
And you are?

48:27.768 --> 48:29.204
Fucking creepy.

48:53.327 --> 48:54.229
Hey, Lisa.

48:54.262 --> 48:56.530
What is happening to me, Mary?

48:56.563 --> 48:57.565
You know, don't you?

48:59.532 --> 49:02.002
You were bitten by
a special kind of wolf

49:02.036 --> 49:03.738
and now you are one.

49:03.771 --> 49:05.840
Okay, I told you I don't
believe in the supernatural.

49:05.873 --> 49:08.643
It's not supernatural,
it's scientific phenomenon.

49:08.675 --> 49:11.346
And I just ran into this
really shady dude in the woods-

49:11.378 --> 49:13.480
- Stay away from
him at all costs.

49:15.315 --> 49:17.518
You're developing
special abilities.

49:17.550 --> 49:18.686
It affects everyone differently.

49:18.719 --> 49:21.755
Most people who actually survive
an attack with only a bite

49:21.789 --> 49:24.292
die of an infection
within hours.

49:35.835 --> 49:36.770
What the hell is this?

49:36.804 --> 49:38.606
A picture of me and my sister.

49:39.773 --> 49:41.375
Sister?

49:41.409 --> 49:43.278
You know she's the
antichrist, right?

49:45.079 --> 49:46.648
We had a rough upbringing.

49:46.681 --> 49:50.518
Our father was a drunk
and somewhere along

49:50.550 --> 49:52.853
the line Debbie became
obsessed with power.

49:53.820 --> 49:54.822
Yeah, I'd say.

49:55.623 --> 49:58.592
She usurped the
sheriff's position

49:58.626 --> 50:00.528
by staging his disappearance.

50:01.929 --> 50:04.532
Pretty sure she fed his
carcass to the wolves.

50:09.804 --> 50:10.639
Wolves.

50:12.806 --> 50:15.509
I am losing control of myself.

50:15.543 --> 50:17.912
- I had done things that are-
- Embrace it.

50:19.045 --> 50:20.914
Then you can learn
to control it.

50:22.550 --> 50:24.019
Lisa, listen to
me very carefully.

50:25.686 --> 50:27.954
You already had the power
to overcome your ordeal,

50:27.987 --> 50:29.856
now you have the
power to make sure

50:29.889 --> 50:32.860
that those that wronged
you pay for what they did.

50:37.797 --> 50:40.367
Take this, read the rest of it.

50:45.106 --> 50:46.474
Open up

50:46.507 --> 50:47.474
or I'm gonna break
the door down.

50:47.507 --> 50:49.076
What do you want?

50:49.110 --> 50:51.846
Um, excuse me? Can I
help you with something?

50:51.878 --> 50:53.880
What is that? Patchouli?

50:53.914 --> 50:54.716
Yeah, so?

50:54.748 --> 50:55.949
Where is she?

50:55.983 --> 50:57.452
What the hell are
you talking about?

50:57.485 --> 50:58.820
Don't play coy with me,
we're looking for Lisa.

50:58.853 --> 51:00.621
Nick, start searching the place.

51:00.653 --> 51:02.090
I haven't seen her.

51:02.123 --> 51:04.925
Why do you think I went down
to your station yesterday?

51:04.958 --> 51:06.527
And I'm pretty sure you
can't search my place

51:06.559 --> 51:07.795
without a warrant or something.

51:07.827 --> 51:08.963
You can take that
warrant and you can

51:08.996 --> 51:10.398
shove it up your backside.

51:10.431 --> 51:11.699
Now, we're gonna start
searching this place

51:11.731 --> 51:12.934
and you better
pray to high heaven

51:12.967 --> 51:14.735
that we don't find
her, you understand?

51:14.768 --> 51:16.703
Fine, go ahead and search.

51:16.737 --> 51:17.939
You're not going
to find anything.

51:17.972 --> 51:20.675
You see? I told ya
she'd give us permission.

51:25.880 --> 51:27.849
Found this brick of weed.

51:27.882 --> 51:28.849
No sign of Lisa.

51:30.985 --> 51:32.387
You get this from Jessie?

51:32.420 --> 51:33.988
No, her competition.

51:36.056 --> 51:38.992
Look, I told you you
wouldn't find anything.

51:39.025 --> 51:40.527
My friend is missing.

51:40.561 --> 51:41.796
Would you please find her?

51:41.829 --> 51:43.398
All right, but if we
find out she's been here

51:43.431 --> 51:45.432
you're both going to jail.

51:45.465 --> 51:46.967
That is unless you wanna
come down to the station

51:47.001 --> 51:48.870
and fill out that report.

51:48.902 --> 51:50.971
Get the fuck out of my house.

51:51.005 --> 51:52.740
All right, Nick. Let's go.

51:52.773 --> 51:55.809
Oh, and we're
confiscating your dope.

51:55.842 --> 51:58.045
Next time buy from Jessie.

52:01.047 --> 52:01.949
Assholes.

53:29.936 --> 53:31.806
Oh, thank god it's you.

53:31.838 --> 53:33.074
They came here, Lis.

53:33.106 --> 53:34.608
- They know something's up.
- I know.

53:35.275 --> 53:36.676
What's wrong?

53:36.710 --> 53:38.612
Jessica's passed
out at my place.

53:38.646 --> 53:40.515
Did you, you know,?

53:42.048 --> 53:43.518
No.

53:43.550 --> 53:44.152
Good.

53:45.853 --> 53:47.188
I did get some
answers, though.

53:52.626 --> 53:54.262
Hey, Sam, come here for a sec.

53:55.896 --> 53:56.731
Okay.

54:06.005 --> 54:08.975
The last thing you
ate today was a salad

54:09.009 --> 54:12.679
with romaine
lettuce and spinach,

54:13.579 --> 54:18.552
cherry tomatoes, almond
slivers, croutons,

54:19.887 --> 54:21.823
and berry vinaigrette dressing.

54:23.090 --> 54:25.693
Oh, and you're ovulating.

54:27.327 --> 54:28.295
Wow.

54:28.329 --> 54:29.163
Right?

54:30.197 --> 54:31.599
What else does it say?

54:31.632 --> 54:35.769
Um it says that
I can heal from all

54:35.802 --> 54:39.906
but the most severe wounds
or ones made with silver.

54:39.940 --> 54:42.610
Fire and decapitation
can also kill me.

54:43.677 --> 54:44.312
Yay.

54:45.945 --> 54:49.817
And there's an entry
here in Spanish that says

54:52.952 --> 54:55.121
So, beware of the
first lunar light.

54:55.155 --> 54:57.124
What happens then?

54:57.157 --> 55:02.163
Um, I can possibly turn
into a wolf and stay that way

55:04.231 --> 55:06.968
or I could turn into an.

55:08.802 --> 55:09.604
A crossbreed.

55:10.704 --> 55:12.807
If I'm strong I'll stay lucid,

55:12.840 --> 55:16.143
and if not I could
permanently lose my mind.

55:16.175 --> 55:18.179
So, that's great.

55:20.114 --> 55:23.150
This all went down during
the full moon, right?

55:23.182 --> 55:24.217
Yeah.

55:28.054 --> 55:29.923
I say we leave town.

55:31.125 --> 55:32.960
Like forever.

55:37.231 --> 55:38.266
Okay.

58:11.485 --> 58:13.554
Hey, Sam.

58:13.586 --> 58:15.188
I said hi, Sam.

58:18.192 --> 58:19.393
You look fantastic.

58:20.494 --> 58:22.096
You sure do have a nice house.

58:24.197 --> 58:26.533
Be a shame for you to throw
that all away, wouldn't it?

58:28.135 --> 58:30.138
Is there a reason you're
parked in front of it?

58:31.838 --> 58:33.039
You need to take care.

58:34.273 --> 58:36.409
Stay on the up and up,
you know what I mean?

58:38.911 --> 58:40.147
Are you threatening me?

59:00.032 --> 59:01.601
Sam!

01:00:07.434 --> 01:00:08.269
Hi, Dana.

01:00:10.938 --> 01:00:13.106
What the fuck?

01:00:13.139 --> 01:00:14.275
You swing like a boy.

01:00:15.442 --> 01:00:18.012
Millie deserved a
quick death, you don't.

01:00:18.045 --> 01:00:19.413
Fuck you,
she was my friend.

01:00:19.445 --> 01:00:20.981
I'm just protecting mine.

01:00:55.614 --> 01:00:58.151
Lisa!

01:00:58.184 --> 01:00:59.320
Oh, not again.

01:01:00.721 --> 01:01:02.489
You smell like fries.

01:01:02.521 --> 01:01:04.057
Did you bring me any?

01:01:39.525 --> 01:01:41.627
Restaurant's
normally closed today.

01:01:41.661 --> 01:01:44.532
Folks couldn't find her so
they came here looking for her.

01:01:46.199 --> 01:01:48.202
God, I wonder how long
she was held there.

01:01:49.135 --> 01:01:49.971
Well, shit.

01:02:52.132 --> 01:02:53.534
Oh no.

01:02:53.567 --> 01:02:54.402
Lisa!

01:03:19.693 --> 01:03:21.629
They're gonna suffer.

01:03:22.661 --> 01:03:23.730
This isn't you.

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:26.699
Don't stoop to their level.

01:03:26.733 --> 01:03:29.503
And I know they think
you ruined your life,

01:03:29.536 --> 01:03:31.871
but they didn't take everything.

01:03:31.905 --> 01:03:33.107
You're still alive.

01:03:35.675 --> 01:03:37.244
They did take everything.

01:03:39.512 --> 01:03:42.215
Lisa.

01:03:45.684 --> 01:03:48.088
I'll never feel whole again.

01:03:49.655 --> 01:03:51.659
You're still you.

01:03:52.692 --> 01:03:54.394
Don't forget that.

01:04:17.217 --> 01:04:18.818
You're the only
one I've got left.

01:04:23.489 --> 01:04:25.325
I actually like sappy you, so.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.849
Obviously not a
vegetarian anymore.

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.189
Didn't we agree to leave?

01:04:55.889 --> 01:04:57.657
We should've done that already.

01:04:57.690 --> 01:04:59.592
We've got nothing
keeping us here now.

01:05:00.559 --> 01:05:03.829
I need to take care of Jessica
and Nick on Friday night.

01:05:03.862 --> 01:05:04.898
After that.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.669
Millie and Dana
are dead, right?

01:05:09.835 --> 01:05:11.204
Do you feel any better?

01:05:15.909 --> 01:05:17.744
What about Deb?

01:05:17.777 --> 01:05:19.313
I want her to know it was me.

01:05:21.414 --> 01:05:22.716
Lisa, these are
dangerous people

01:05:22.748 --> 01:05:23.916
and you're not invincible.

01:05:23.949 --> 01:05:25.551
I'll be careful.

01:05:25.585 --> 01:05:26.686
They can't hurt me.

01:05:27.853 --> 01:05:28.888
I don't wanna lose my friend

01:05:28.922 --> 01:05:30.224
- to those ha-
- You won't.

01:05:33.025 --> 01:05:33.893
I promise.

01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:04.718
See you later, baby.

01:07:10.956 --> 01:07:11.991
Doing okay?

01:07:13.793 --> 01:07:14.628
Can we go?

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:18.565
No.

01:07:18.597 --> 01:07:19.965
You're gonna sit here
and you're gonna keep

01:07:19.998 --> 01:07:21.434
that little mouth shut.

01:07:22.135 --> 01:07:22.970
You got it?

01:07:35.382 --> 01:07:36.483
Who's that?

01:07:38.385 --> 01:07:39.019
Mama.

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:50.463
You are worthless, Chester.

01:07:50.496 --> 01:07:51.531
You know that, right?

01:08:10.483 --> 01:08:11.952
Hm, you must be new.

01:08:14.654 --> 01:08:15.522
What's your name?

01:08:17.524 --> 01:08:19.960
Um, Virginia.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.862
Virginia.

01:08:23.694 --> 01:08:24.796
Has a nice ring to it.

01:08:29.068 --> 01:08:31.572
What do you say we get
out of this hellhole?

01:08:32.671 --> 01:08:33.506
Come on.

01:08:36.643 --> 01:08:37.478
Hurry up.

01:08:55.962 --> 01:08:57.631
Nice leggings.

01:08:57.662 --> 01:08:58.765
Get you more business?

01:09:00.667 --> 01:09:02.669
I guess.

01:09:02.702 --> 01:09:03.904
All right, well, you're
new here so I'm gonna

01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:06.171
tell you how it's
gonna be, all right?

01:09:06.206 --> 01:09:10.109
You will provide me with
full service free of charge

01:09:11.711 --> 01:09:14.548
and in exchange I'm not
gonna haul you off to jail.

01:09:14.581 --> 01:09:15.747
Pretty sweet deal, huh?

01:09:24.224 --> 01:09:29.430
All right, let's get kinky.

01:09:30.095 --> 01:09:31.596
All right, enough of this.

01:09:31.631 --> 01:09:34.134
You think I'm
fucking stupid, Lisa?

01:10:04.764 --> 01:10:05.931

01:10:11.871 --> 01:10:12.706
Bitch.

01:10:14.106 --> 01:10:16.109
Don't bother, it's
definitely broken.

Lisa.

01:14:00.766 --> 01:14:02.769
You scared the shit out of me.

01:14:02.801 --> 01:14:04.170
What the hell are
you doing here?

01:14:04.203 --> 01:14:05.105
Looking for you.

01:14:06.037 --> 01:14:07.172
In a hurry?

01:14:07.206 --> 01:14:09.309
Um, I'm just
here with somebody.

01:14:09.341 --> 01:14:10.909
Should probably see
how they're doing.

01:14:10.943 --> 01:14:12.112
Forget about him.

01:14:13.113 --> 01:14:16.283
I sought you out because I
wanted to bare my soul to you.

01:14:17.315 --> 01:14:18.350
Oh yeah?

01:14:20.819 --> 01:14:23.822
I like what you did to me.

01:14:23.855 --> 01:14:25.024
Okay, get outta here.

01:14:26.192 --> 01:14:27.260
What, do you think I'm
some kind of idiot?

01:14:27.292 --> 01:14:28.994
I'm serious.

01:14:29.028 --> 01:14:32.164
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about it since.

01:14:32.198 --> 01:14:33.033
I want more.

01:14:44.143 --> 01:14:44.978
Kiss me.

01:15:08.434 --> 01:15:09.469
Do it.

01:15:43.869 --> 01:15:44.570
Nick?

01:15:44.604 --> 01:15:46.072
You have your radio on ya?

01:15:47.273 --> 01:15:50.476
Why is your car over
there on 5th Street?

01:15:51.644 --> 01:15:54.480
I need you to meet me
back at the station.

01:15:54.512 --> 01:15:59.519
Nick.

01:16:00.453 --> 01:16:02.088
Hello, Sheriff.

01:16:02.121 --> 01:16:02.956
It's me.

01:16:04.489 --> 01:16:06.393
Oh, good, I've
been looking for you.

01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:09.462
Say, Sheriff, you weren't
hoping for grandkids

01:16:09.494 --> 01:16:11.096
any time soon now, were you?

01:16:11.997 --> 01:16:12.832
God damn it.

01:16:17.536 --> 01:16:19.172
Perhaps I can
repay you for that.

01:16:19.204 --> 01:16:20.405
Why don't you meet me
back at the station?

01:16:20.439 --> 01:16:23.076
I got a little surprise for you.

01:16:24.042 --> 01:16:25.878
And what's that?

01:16:25.912 --> 01:16:27.881
I got your
best friend with me.

01:16:33.653 --> 01:16:35.320
What?

01:16:35.354 --> 01:16:38.490
Yep, the lovely Samantha.

01:16:43.529 --> 01:16:45.198
Don't you fucking touch her.

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:47.067
Oh, she didn't
come along willingly.

01:16:48.266 --> 01:16:49.501
Put her on, I
wanna hear her voice.

01:16:49.534 --> 01:16:51.938
Well, she can hear
you but she can't come

01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:53.438
to the phone right now,
you're just gonna have

01:16:53.471 --> 01:16:54.974
to trust me on that one.

01:16:58.610 --> 01:17:00.246
I'm coming for you, Deb.

01:17:00.279 --> 01:17:02.482
We'll be waiting for
ya at the police station.

01:17:03.983 --> 01:17:06.152
I'm gonna get you
outta this, Sam.

01:17:06.185 --> 01:17:07.320
Don't worry, I promise.

01:17:24.502 --> 01:17:26.206
Yeah, Adolphus,
this is me, Deb.

01:17:27.372 --> 01:17:30.609
Yeah, well, I wouldn't be
calling ya if I didn't have her.

01:17:30.643 --> 01:17:32.011
Yeah, I got her friend, too.

01:17:32.043 --> 01:17:35.213
You need to meet me down
at the station. Now.

01:17:35.247 --> 01:17:36.650
Uh huh, bring your gear with ya.

01:17:39.618 --> 01:17:42.722
We're gonna have us a little
fun, ain't we, Samantha?

01:18:16.188 --> 01:18:17.457
You sit your ass down.

01:18:17.489 --> 01:18:18.358
Fuck you!

01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:21.360
You stay if you know
what's good for ya.

01:18:24.296 --> 01:18:25.532
Bitch must be here.

01:18:58.564 --> 01:19:00.266
You think you can
sneak up on me?

01:19:01.699 --> 01:19:04.269
That's the second time I
popped you in here, isn't it?

01:19:06.671 --> 01:19:07.673
You should've seen it.

01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:13.812
I slit your daughter's
throat and I ate Nick.

01:19:16.515 --> 01:19:18.284
I know how to
deal with your kind.

01:19:19.118 --> 01:19:19.753
Silver weapon.

01:19:23.354 --> 01:19:24.623
Good for you.

01:19:30.128 --> 01:19:32.498
Dolphus, help me get her up.

01:19:44.577 --> 01:19:46.212
Yeah, you hold
her arms in place.

01:19:50.615 --> 01:19:51.650
Here we go.

01:20:01.726 --> 01:20:04.197
Damn, she's a feisty
one, ain't she, D?

01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:06.631
Here, let's do the other one.

01:20:17.643 --> 01:20:18.645
Go get the brand.

01:20:22.381 --> 01:20:24.184
We've been hunting
wolves for years.

01:20:25.583 --> 01:20:26.752
We figured you'd become one.

01:20:28.587 --> 01:20:30.490
Or at least make a
nice meal for 'em.

01:20:43.868 --> 01:20:45.270
It's a sign of your kind.

01:20:46.704 --> 01:20:49.708
Now, I'm sorry, Lisa, but
we gotta keep track of you.

01:20:50.743 --> 01:20:52.378
Hold still.

01:20:53.412 --> 01:20:54.814
I don't wanna mess up the girls.

01:21:04.323 --> 01:21:05.158
Silver brand.

01:21:06.457 --> 01:21:08.127
That mark ain't
never going away.

01:21:09.528 --> 01:21:11.297
I am gonna kill you.

01:21:11.329 --> 01:21:14.199
Lord knows I've
heard that one before.

01:21:14.233 --> 01:21:16.869
Now we wait for the full moon
to see what's gonna happen.

01:21:19.805 --> 01:21:21.274
Oh, you've heard, haven't ya?

01:21:22.675 --> 01:21:25.712
Most folks turn permanently
and we have to hunt 'em.

01:21:27.279 --> 01:21:31.384
Others develop wolf-like
features during the full moon

01:21:31.417 --> 01:21:33.353
and return to being
human the next day.

01:21:34.619 --> 01:21:36.855
Last one we had like
that escaped recently.

01:21:38.289 --> 01:21:39.859
She was your cousin,
if I'm not mistaken.

01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:43.930
Gretchen.

01:21:43.962 --> 01:21:44.764
Yeah.

01:21:45.831 --> 01:21:46.865
What happened to her?

01:21:48.266 --> 01:21:50.170
We caught her and
I had to kill her.

01:21:53.538 --> 01:21:55.273
Seven years is a long time

01:21:55.306 --> 01:21:57.443
to be held captive
by this weirdo.

01:21:59.511 --> 01:22:00.746
We're hoping with your
lineage you're one

01:22:00.779 --> 01:22:03.282
of the special
ones, and if you are

01:22:03.314 --> 01:22:06.719
we're gonna hack off your
limbs so you can't get away.

01:22:08.854 --> 01:22:12.625
Silver ax, they won't grow back.

01:22:12.658 --> 01:22:15.328
And then Dolphus is gonna
put you in a little box.

01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:19.765
And Sam?

01:22:22.868 --> 01:22:23.903
I'm not sure.

01:22:25.537 --> 01:22:27.840
We might have you bite her,
see if you can turn her, too.

01:22:29.641 --> 01:22:30.876
Don't please.

01:22:31.644 --> 01:22:33.479
- Please, let her go.
- You don't fight it,

01:22:33.511 --> 01:22:34.346
sweetheart.

01:22:35.581 --> 01:22:37.483
There's nothing you
can do to stop it.

01:23:10.349 --> 01:23:11.684
Well, that's it.

01:23:12.917 --> 01:23:14.386
I think she's done, D.

01:23:19.425 --> 01:23:22.862

Damn, I never had one that
could talk during a full moon.

01:23:26.832 --> 01:23:27.934
Here, let me.

01:23:29.568 --> 01:23:30.836
This one's personal.

01:23:30.868 --> 01:23:32.671
No, do me
instead, do me instead.

01:23:32.704 --> 01:23:33.706
What? What do you want?

01:23:33.738 --> 01:23:34.839
Do me instead.

01:23:34.872 --> 01:23:36.041
Do me instead.

01:23:37.376 --> 01:23:38.978

01:23:40.645 --> 01:23:41.780

Hell, there ain't nobody on
this planet I'd do that for,

01:23:45.117 --> 01:23:46.653
least of all my best friend.

01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:49.021
What?

01:23:50.588 --> 01:23:53.591
You want me to test
the ax out on you?

01:23:53.625 --> 01:23:54.793
See how sharp it is?

01:23:55.894 --> 01:23:56.863
That's a good idea.

01:23:57.996 --> 01:23:58.864
Now, let's see.

01:24:00.832 --> 01:24:04.036
Nose, ears.

01:24:05.069 --> 01:24:06.805
Oh.

01:24:06.838 --> 01:24:09.007
You two are touching,
you really are.

01:24:10.109 --> 01:24:11.477
Don't worry, Sam.

01:24:12.478 --> 01:24:14.480
I'm gonna go easy on ya.

01:24:17.949 --> 01:24:20.019
Yeah, it's good and sharp.

01:24:27.059 --> 01:24:28.027
All right, Lisa.

01:24:29.461 --> 01:24:32.398
The only time you're
coming outta that box

01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:33.932
is when Dolphus wants to play.

01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:39.005
Bitch.

01:25:26.118 --> 01:25:27.086
Okay, Lisa.

01:25:28.086 --> 01:25:29.021
No more games.

01:25:32.123 --> 01:25:33.958
But I love playing
kill the sheriff.

01:25:47.872 --> 01:25:49.741
Did you really eat Nick?

01:25:51.009 --> 01:25:52.877
Can you keep your
mouth that way then?

01:25:56.881 --> 01:25:57.716
Who shot Deb?

01:26:01.153 --> 01:26:02.655
What are you doing here?

01:26:03.822 --> 01:26:06.958
Shooting my sister
and saving your life.

01:26:06.992 --> 01:26:08.726
You're welcome.

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:11.130
How were you following
me without me knowing?

01:26:12.163 --> 01:26:13.498
I stay downwind of you.

01:26:14.666 --> 01:26:16.101
Can we maybe do
this somewhere else?

01:26:17.668 --> 01:26:21.039
I have a, uh, couple things
I need to take care of.

01:26:38.189 --> 01:26:40.759
Wake up, little pig.

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:45.130
What are you doing?

01:26:45.162 --> 01:26:50.101
You said so yourself, my
friends out here, the wolves,

01:26:51.569 --> 01:26:53.171
they prefer live game.

01:26:54.872 --> 01:26:56.174
You can't leave me out here.

01:26:57.809 --> 01:26:58.644
Sure, I can.

01:27:01.313 --> 01:27:04.048
You'd be nothing without me.

01:27:10.988 --> 01:27:15.260
I'm a new terror
born in death.

01:27:59.637 --> 01:28:01.073
What's your name?

01:28:02.173 --> 01:28:03.009
Brooke.

01:28:04.141 --> 01:28:05.243
Let's go, Brooke.

01:28:05.277 --> 01:28:06.945
Hey!

01:28:06.979 --> 01:28:08.814
What the fuck is this?

01:28:27.332 --> 01:28:29.335
Are you a monster?

01:28:29.368 --> 01:28:30.202
I'm Lisa.
