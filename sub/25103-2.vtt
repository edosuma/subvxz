00:01.080 --> 00:02.707
Previously on Queen Sugar...

00:02.750 --> 00:04.206
We see you this time next year

00:04.250 --> 00:06.787
with your New York Times
bestseller.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.990
Who wouldve guessed?
Partners.

00:09.050 --> 00:12.963
Feels bad having a secret
like ours, dont it?

00:13.010 --> 00:16.218
Ill burn the entire
Landry family
to the goddamn ground.

00:16.260 --> 00:19.309
You got to understand
that I dont need no pedestal.

00:19.350 --> 00:20.590
I got wings.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.437
When are you
coming to get me?

00:22.480 --> 00:25.051
So yall not together no more?

00:25.100 --> 00:26.761
These are your results.

00:41.370 --> 00:42.906
I want to be an artist

00:42.960 --> 00:46.077
Im in too deep
No sleep

00:46.130 --> 00:48.280
My peeps cant hang with me

00:48.340 --> 00:53.460
I want to now
Be an artist

00:53.510 --> 00:56.832
Im in too deep
No sleep

00:56.890 --> 00:59.006
My peeps cant hang with me

00:59.050 --> 01:03.384
I want to now
Be an artist

01:03.430 --> 01:07.139
"Woke black teens cause trouble
at Basketball Classic."

01:08.690 --> 01:09.816
What the hell?

01:11.690 --> 01:13.851
Shes another one
Who you never see

01:13.900 --> 01:15.310
And sayin
Be my friend

01:15.360 --> 01:16.770
Guess you never be

01:16.820 --> 01:19.232
I push off
Push off

01:22.040 --> 01:23.576
Dreams never die

01:23.620 --> 01:26.362
Take flight
As the world turns

01:26.420 --> 01:27.956
Dreams never die

01:28.000 --> 01:29.410
Take flight
As the world turns

01:29.460 --> 01:31.621
Keep the colors
In the lines

01:31.670 --> 01:32.830
Take flight

01:34.130 --> 01:35.290
Dreams never die

01:41.510 --> 01:44.172
Keep the colors
In the lines

01:46.060 --> 01:48.392
Keep the colors
In the lines, take flight

01:51.110 --> 01:53.066
Miss Vi,
sorry to keep you waiting.

01:53.110 --> 01:54.987
Oh, thats all right.
How you doing, Mr. Rawlings?

01:55.030 --> 01:56.486
Im good.

01:56.530 --> 01:57.849
Miss Vi,
what do you see?

02:00.780 --> 02:02.236
Some canned goods.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.657
Sylvias Soul Food
and seasoning.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.702
Well, for now.

02:06.750 --> 02:11.289
But in the near future,
I see Vis Prized Pies

02:11.340 --> 02:13.547
on central display
in all my stores.

02:13.590 --> 02:14.830
Starting here.

02:17.510 --> 02:18.829
Youre kidding.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.848
We sold out of your pies
over the holidays

02:20.890 --> 02:22.630
by word of mouth alone.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.090
And all we did was put them
on a table

02:24.140 --> 02:25.516
in the corner
of the bakery.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.300
-Imagine what we could do

02:27.350 --> 02:31.798
if we gave your pies
the red carpet treatment.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.522
Well, I aint never walked
a red carpet,

02:34.570 --> 02:36.185
but Id like to.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.526
If...

02:39.570 --> 02:43.449
if you can double your order
by the end of the week,

02:43.490 --> 02:46.744
Ill increase your royalty
by 250/0.

02:46.790 --> 02:48.109
Double the order?

02:52.960 --> 02:54.245
You got a deal.

02:56.170 --> 02:57.376
Them kids wasnt confused.

02:57.420 --> 02:58.626
Thats right.

02:58.670 --> 02:59.967
Disrespectful, maybe.

03:00.010 --> 03:01.750
But if you ask me,
they was very clear.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.256
Soon as they took a knee
on that court,

03:03.300 --> 03:05.348
they knew it was going
to make a fuss.

03:05.390 --> 03:07.051
And a fuss is all
they got.

03:07.100 --> 03:09.762
Respectfully, Im going
to disagree with you, Cardale.

03:09.810 --> 03:11.846
No, see, in that moment
what I saw was,

03:11.900 --> 03:14.972
we need to deal with how folks
really feel about each other.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.602
These are dangerous times,
brothers.

03:17.650 --> 03:18.981
And we cant just look away.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.577
Speech! Speech!

03:31.620 --> 03:34.418
Its great to see everyone.
I appreciate the warm welcome.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.666
So, yes,

03:37.710 --> 03:39.337
we hit a few bumps
in the road last year.

03:39.380 --> 03:42.372
Harvest didnt go
exactly as planned.

03:42.430 --> 03:46.878
Even though you had every right
to feel intimidated,

03:46.930 --> 03:48.807
uncertain,

03:48.850 --> 03:51.512
you took another chance on me
and you came back.

03:51.560 --> 03:55.052
Queen Sugar is still standing
because of you.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.476
Our facility--
and I say "our"

03:57.520 --> 03:59.226
because in a way,
Queen Sugar,

03:59.280 --> 04:01.350
it belongs to all of us--

04:01.400 --> 04:05.404
our facility and business
is stronger than ever.

04:05.450 --> 04:07.611
And I am happy to announce

04:07.660 --> 04:11.323
that your discounted rate is
fixed for the next five years.

04:11.370 --> 04:12.860
-Oh!
Hell, yeah.

04:18.090 --> 04:21.127
I thank you for coming back
to Queen Sugar.

04:21.170 --> 04:23.877
Lets show Louisiana
that black businesses

04:23.930 --> 04:25.795
and black customers thrive

04:25.840 --> 04:28.172
when allowed
to truly compete.

04:28.220 --> 04:30.427
Thats right.
Yes, maam.

04:33.020 --> 04:34.396
-So, eat up.
Thank you.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.010
-Im gone, brothers.

04:36.060 --> 04:38.062
-All right, man. Take it easy.
-All right, brother.

04:42.280 --> 04:45.022
So, this is you now?

04:45.070 --> 04:47.277
Tricking your own people
into giving you their business

04:47.320 --> 04:49.151
so you can turn around
and give it to the Landrys?

04:50.950 --> 04:53.657
Or they could just
give it to them directly.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.450
At a higher percentage.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.832
Does it matter _
who really owns the mill,

04:57.880 --> 05:00.087
as long as the farmers
get the break they need?

05:00.130 --> 05:02.542
Guess it depends on what
youre giving up to get it.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.120
I am the good guy here.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.886
Yet your hands
are getting dirty.

05:06.930 --> 05:09.137
Well, if they are,
its because thats what happens

05:09.180 --> 05:11.808
to people who are actually
trying to change things

05:11.850 --> 05:15.138
instead of, I dont know,
living on the sidelines.

05:35.290 --> 05:36.917
Dont worry
about all that.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.916
Thanks, Rah.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.706
You going to be all right?

05:43.760 --> 05:47.002
Is it too early to ask
for a glass of wine?

05:47.050 --> 05:48.210
Yeah.

05:50.180 --> 05:51.636
What you doing
tomorrow night?

05:51.680 --> 05:54.592
I got you. You and me.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.010
-Good to see you.

06:04.690 --> 06:07.488
Lord, I hope thats my pie tins.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.940
-Thats me.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.285
All right.

06:16.330 --> 06:18.070
I just need you
to sign for me.

06:24.210 --> 06:25.541
What is it?

06:25.590 --> 06:26.909
Dont know
what it is, maam.

06:34.390 --> 06:37.518
The eagle has landed, Vi.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.430
Look at God.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.522
Oh, congratulations, baby.

06:46.690 --> 06:48.146
Hey, where are
you going?

06:48.200 --> 06:49.565
Pies aint going
to make themselves,

06:49.610 --> 06:51.771
and Im breaking Rhonda in.

06:51.820 --> 06:53.731
Call me when my pie tins come.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.281
But, baby, Im going
to the bank

06:55.330 --> 06:58.072
-and then we going shopping.
-Ho||ywood, baby,

06:58.120 --> 07:02.329
we said that we wasnt going to
let this money change anything.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.668
I know, but baby,
today is special.

07:05.710 --> 07:07.917
And so is my business.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.210
But...

07:10.840 --> 07:13.638
were going to celebrate later.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.307
In private.

07:15.350 --> 07:16.760
Mm.

07:19.270 --> 07:22.649
Going to give you
your own private dance.

07:22.690 --> 07:25.011
Mm. The Tina Turner 84, huh?

07:25.070 --> 07:26.310
Ooh!

07:28.570 --> 07:29.810
Mm!

07:29.860 --> 07:32.021
Im going
to make it rain.

07:32.070 --> 07:33.731
So can you back me on this?

07:33.780 --> 07:36.237
Come on, man, I just want
to spend time with my son, okay?

07:36.290 --> 07:38.281
I didnt come back here
to fight with you.

07:38.330 --> 07:40.241
Or your mom.

07:40.290 --> 07:43.327
And Im not theme
you got to conVInce.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.746
Dad, most of the kids
that go to Iw Leagues

07:45.790 --> 07:48.953
and the best universities
come from public schools.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.752
But you going
to public school--

07:51.800 --> 07:54.291
that goes against everything
your mom wants for you.

07:56.140 --> 07:58.882
All right, with your mom,

07:58.930 --> 08:00.136
everythings logic.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.387
All right? Everything.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.510
Put together an airtight
argument, you might have a shot.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.311
His name is Randall Orson.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.487
Hes been a local officer
for 22 years.

08:14.530 --> 08:16.157
But according to this video

08:16.200 --> 08:17.770
received by local law
enforcement yesterday

08:17.830 --> 08:19.866
and that has since gone viral,

08:19.910 --> 08:23.243
hes spent much of that time
assaulting young black males.

08:23.290 --> 08:25.576
Though many in the community
are calling

08:25.630 --> 08:27.837
for Orsons termination
and arrest,

08:27.880 --> 08:31.168
several local activists
say that isnt enough.

08:31.220 --> 08:34.428
The activists believe
a message needs to be sent:

08:34.470 --> 08:38.054
a message that unnecessary
force and violence

08:38.100 --> 08:39.965
will no longer be tolerated.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.420
[reporter continues
indistinctly]

08:51.320 --> 08:53.390
-Sorry to keep you waiting.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.027
-I know youre upset.
-And I have every right to be.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.742
You gutted my article without
even the courtesy of a heads-up.

09:01.790 --> 09:03.530
I knew if you found out
before it went to press,

09:03.580 --> 09:05.366
you would
talk me out of it.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.412
Nova, look, youre being labeled
a black identity extremist.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.701
Thats a bullshit formulation
made up by this administration

09:10.750 --> 09:12.411
to criminalize activists.

09:12.460 --> 09:13.711
The truth is,
ads have taken a hit

09:13.760 --> 09:15.125
since your last article
went viral.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.171
Yeah, critics loved it.

09:17.220 --> 09:18.676
But were seeing the effect
on the papers bottom line.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.631
Since when does advertising
dictate content

09:20.680 --> 09:23.422
-Thats the world we live in.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.936
Are you asking me
to look the other way

09:24.980 --> 09:26.550
while our country goes to hell
in a handbasket?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.977
I hate this, but you have to lay
low for a while.

09:29.020 --> 09:31.227
At least for now.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.155
Hello?

09:40.200 --> 09:42.156
The book deal is amazing.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.077
A dream come true, right?

09:44.120 --> 09:46.076
But I still took some time
to think about it.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.451
Mm, Nova, you crazy.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.957
Theres always something
to think over,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.456
Sister Too Ready To Sell Out.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.206
We, especially we,

09:53.260 --> 09:54.966
must always read
the fine print.

09:55.010 --> 09:56.500
Did she just call me
a sellout?

09:56.550 --> 09:59.178
She sure did.
Put on your armor, ladies.

09:59.220 --> 10:01.381
-True. True that.

10:01.430 --> 10:03.170
But the unvarnished truth
is what I need today

10:03.220 --> 10:04.517
from my sister tribe.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.721
So, whats up?

10:06.770 --> 10:09.933
Im thinking of quitting
the newspaper.

10:09.980 --> 10:12.562
Just doing me,

10:12.610 --> 10:14.066
focus on my book.

10:14.110 --> 10:16.237
Wait a minute.
QUIt your job?

10:16.280 --> 10:17.895
And then what?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.190
I mean, no offense, Nova,

10:19.240 --> 10:20.730
but what if the book
doesnt sell?

10:20.780 --> 10:22.691
And what if it does?
If we want to make a mark,

10:22.740 --> 10:24.446
we all have to face _that choice
at some p0int.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.958
But Nova thinks for a living.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.412
which means as a woman--
as a black woman--

10:29.460 --> 10:31.337
Shes always in somebodys
crosshairs.

10:31.380 --> 10:35.339
So you dont give up that type
of security and platform easily.

10:35.380 --> 10:37.120
Even ifI have
to compromise?

10:37.170 --> 10:41.595
Nova, no one gets through life
or a career without compromise.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.926
Just wait for it to all
come back around to you.

10:43.970 --> 10:45.926
Thats not very
Black Girl Magic.

10:45.970 --> 10:48.222
Black Girl Magic
is hard work.

10:48.270 --> 10:49.589
Well, I cant argue with that.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.221
Maybe giving up
your platform

10:51.270 --> 10:53.397
and your paycheck at
the same time is too much.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.021
I thought you was
on my side.

10:55.070 --> 10:56.685
I am. Im Issa Rae right now.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.640
Im rooting
for everybody black.

11:02.410 --> 11:04.696
We support you,
whatever you decide.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.998
But girl,
tread carefully.

11:18.170 --> 11:20.582
Most kids who go
to the best colleges

11:20.630 --> 11:22.586
come from public school.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.132
And although Ive had
a private-school education

11:26.180 --> 11:27.670
for most of my life...

11:27.720 --> 11:29.722
You mean all of your life.

11:32.270 --> 11:34.431
My point is,
Im better prepared.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.471
And Ill stand out,

11:36.530 --> 11:37.929
because I wont be competing
with kids

11:37.980 --> 11:39.231
within my own school
as much.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.645
He has a point.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.941
Yale only takes so many kids
from one school.

11:42.990 --> 11:45.402
Also, I wont look like
all those other

11:45.450 --> 11:48.328
spoiled celebrity kids
when I apply for college.

11:48.370 --> 11:50.998
Okay? No fake environments

11:51.040 --> 11:52.667
that have nothing to do
with the real world.

11:52.710 --> 11:55.497
You want more of the real world?

12:00.510 --> 12:04.002
Just think of the college essays
Ill be able to write.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.380
Absolutely not.

12:08.430 --> 12:09.977
Ma, youre not even
giving me a chance.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.635
Giving you a chance
is all Ive ever done.

12:11.690 --> 12:14.341
So Im not about
to throw it all away

12:14.400 --> 12:16.186
because you had a good time at a
basketball game.

12:16.230 --> 12:17.857
-Charley, come on.
-Even with all you have,

12:17.900 --> 12:19.856
with all we could give you,
you will still need

12:19.900 --> 12:23.984
every advantage you can possibly
have just to get in most doors.

12:24.030 --> 12:27.158
Public school is not an option
for you.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.111
Youll thank me later.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.126
Damn!

12:35.170 --> 12:36.626
Oh, come on, Wood,

12:36.670 --> 12:38.490
you aint got to do
all that.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.041
I mean, I appreciate it.

12:41.090 --> 12:43.331
Blue could use some new shoes,
thats for sure.

12:43.380 --> 12:44.711
Yeah...

12:44.760 --> 12:46.216
-Fruit monster!
-Blue!

12:47.510 --> 12:48.807
Hey, man,
I got to go.

12:48.850 --> 12:50.306
Im going to see you tomorrow.

12:53.020 --> 12:55.147
Do I look like
Im playing, Blue?

12:56.860 --> 12:59.602
You keep it up, Im going
to put you on time-out.

13:06.030 --> 13:07.406
Shit.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.951
-Ralph Angel.
-Mr. Jarvis.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.070
Sorry for the unannounced
drop-in,

13:18.130 --> 13:19.870
but, you know,
thats what we do.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.205
Uh-huh.

13:21.250 --> 13:22.547
Come in.

13:22.590 --> 13:23.830
Sorry for the mess.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.120
Doing a lot of labor.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.546
Hiring some new guys
on the farm.

13:27.590 --> 13:29.000
Take a seat.

13:29.050 --> 13:30.881
-Thank you, man.
-Thats for you.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.728
Boy, that seafood job.

13:36.770 --> 13:38.931
-Man!

13:38.980 --> 13:42.609
You know, usually its a lot
more in order around here.

13:42.650 --> 13:45.528
Ive just been trying to get
Blue to learn how to pitch in.

13:47.030 --> 13:48.691
Yeah, well,
good luck with that one, man.

13:48.740 --> 13:51.868
I want to talk to you
about other things anyway.

13:51.910 --> 13:55.994
Id like to support an
application to the parole board

13:56.040 --> 13:58.281
for your early release
from parole.

13:58.330 --> 14:00.457
Louisiana has been
shortening sentences,

14:00.500 --> 14:02.240
setting up new programs.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.666
I know you got a year left.

14:04.710 --> 14:08.123
Im thinking I can get you off
in three months.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.802
Hell, yeah,
Im interested.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.596
Well, theres some paperwork
that we need to fill out.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.596
And, you know,
we can just keep it--

14:18.650 --> 14:21.722
Wait, hold up.
You said youre hiring workers.

14:21.770 --> 14:24.102
Yeah, a few guys.
You know, I aint done none yet.

14:24.150 --> 14:26.482
Look, I know
a few young guys, right?

14:26.530 --> 14:28.145
Most of them just got out.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.272
Non-violent offenders.
Some of them dads.

14:31.320 --> 14:34.448
A couple of them kind of remind
me of you not too long ago.

14:35.910 --> 14:38.117
You know how it is out here
for them.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.991
Yeah, I know.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.747
So, they need a job.

14:42.790 --> 14:46.044
And maybe you can
give them one.

14:46.090 --> 14:47.717
I think this would
do the brothers some good

14:47.760 --> 14:51.924
to see that if you can make it,
they can too.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.318
Rhonda, baby, you can use
that mixer for the meringue.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.146
-Just put it on low.
-No.

15:05.190 --> 15:06.987
I dont trust that new mixer,
Miss Violet.

15:07.030 --> 15:08.566
I messed it up last time,

15:08.610 --> 15:10.157
so Im going to just
do this by hand

15:10.200 --> 15:12.361
until me and that new mixer
get on better terms.

15:12.410 --> 15:14.617
All right, as long as you can
keep up and stay on schedule.

15:14.660 --> 15:17.402
-Yes, maam.
-Thats right.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.327
It aint even hot.

15:19.370 --> 15:21.281
You got to be kidding me.

15:21.330 --> 15:23.787
Not today, devil.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.831
-I|| make some calls.
Where yall at?

15:28.340 --> 15:29.580
Hey.

15:29.630 --> 15:30.961
Hey, baby.
-Hey.

15:33.180 --> 15:34.386
Recipes.

15:34.430 --> 15:36.057
Four months worth of meals.

15:36.100 --> 15:39.172
Some organic herbs
and veggies to get you started.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.839
Thats awfully sweet,

15:41.900 --> 15:43.800
but only thing cooking
in this kitchen is pies

15:43.860 --> 15:47.819
if I can get this doggone oven
to act right.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.559
I dont have time
for this.

15:56.450 --> 15:57.656
Any luck, Rhonda?

15:57.700 --> 15:59.611
One second, Miss Violet.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.319
I...

16:04.380 --> 16:07.872
its just this push
for this big order.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.377
You know, I dont want
a little bit of pain

16:10.420 --> 16:11.796
to get in the way
of my future.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.889
Youre only human,
Aunt Vi.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.545
Ive been only human
my whole life.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.249
I want to be
something else now.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.801
I want to be a warrior.

16:20.850 --> 16:23.011
Like your mama.
Like you.

16:23.060 --> 16:25.551
Me? I dont know.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.350
Feels like I take
one step forward,

16:27.400 --> 16:30.733
it aint long before something
else pushes me two steps back.

16:32.530 --> 16:35.658
Now, I know those folks
at your job aint tripping.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.941
With all the kudos
youve been getting?

16:42.830 --> 16:45.071
You should just go all in
on your book.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.995
Bet on yourself, baby.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.625
Thats what Im doing.

16:49.670 --> 16:51.547
Finally, after 59 years.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.427
You find anything
about some ovens?

16:57.470 --> 17:01.258
Yeah. We can talk to Effie
at the church.

17:03.020 --> 17:05.011
No, were not going
to do that.

17:09.230 --> 17:10.811
I have an idea.

17:27.540 --> 17:30.293
I thought we were
having dinner.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.331
I wanted you
to see this first.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.137
When my daddy passed away,

17:37.180 --> 17:40.422
he left me his
second-greatest love,

17:40.470 --> 17:42.347
passed down from his dad.

17:42.390 --> 17:44.096
Ive been fixing her up.

17:45.390 --> 17:47.142
Its beautiful.

17:47.190 --> 17:50.262
He courted my mom on this boat
back when they were teens.

17:50.320 --> 17:54.643
He was working-class
and she was Louisiana royalty.

17:54.690 --> 17:58.023
My plan is to get her
on the water before the summer.

17:58.070 --> 17:59.697
Id love to take you
out on it.

18:02.740 --> 18:07.200
You know, my daddy,
he lived for the water.

18:07.250 --> 18:10.287
The irony being, my mama,
like your daddy,

18:10.340 --> 18:11.955
lived for the land.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.709
Louisiana soil passed down
generation to generation,

18:15.760 --> 18:17.625
from her daddys hands
to hers.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.965
Well, thats all very nice,

18:19.010 --> 18:20.966
but whats it got
to do with me?

18:22.470 --> 18:24.176
My daddys superstitious.

18:25.310 --> 18:27.437
He said...

18:27.480 --> 18:29.186
"Always toast a new partnership

18:29.230 --> 18:31.551
as close to the water
as pOSSlble."

18:31.610 --> 18:33.566
He believed people
could pretend

18:33.610 --> 18:35.737
to be something else
on dry ground

18:35.780 --> 18:38.567
that they couldnt
pretend to be in rough water.

18:38.610 --> 18:40.908
So...

18:40.950 --> 18:42.520
to our partnership.

18:56.630 --> 18:58.416
I need to ask you
a question.

18:58.470 --> 19:02.634
We have an agreement that youd
leave my farmers alone.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.136
But lets be real.

19:04.180 --> 19:06.671
Sam owns Queen Sugar.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.051
Thats true.

19:09.730 --> 19:14.178
So why is Landry Enterprises
allowing my farmers

19:14.230 --> 19:15.561
to keep their discounts?

19:15.610 --> 19:19.319
The truth is, Sam wanted
to break the deal.

19:19.360 --> 19:22.363
Hes all about
the bottom line.

19:22.410 --> 19:24.526
-But we stopped him.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.617
Our side of the family
always stands by our word.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.958
Quite the change from the man
I met last year.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.412
Dont think Im just
Sams lackey.

19:35.590 --> 19:37.251
Neven

19:37.300 --> 19:40.007
But Im realizing
that you are a man

19:40.050 --> 19:43.258
with bigger and bolder
ambitions.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.460
Yes, maam.

19:46.180 --> 19:49.058
Now that you managed
to pull off that 1%,

19:49.100 --> 19:51.011
brings you into
the family.

19:51.060 --> 19:53.301
And were all about family.

20:03.530 --> 20:05.828
You ready with the rest
of those pies, Rhonda?

20:05.870 --> 20:08.691
Yes, maam, gonna pop them
in the oven in just one second.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.241
Okay, great, then you can
help me pack these up.

20:11.290 --> 20:12.700
Okay.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.627
Youve got to be kidding me.

20:19.460 --> 20:21.416
Thought you went fishing,
Clive.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.085
You couldve asked,
Violet.

20:23.130 --> 20:26.679
Just needed some extra ovens
for a clay or so.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.551
Not one customer
has been kept waiting,

20:28.600 --> 20:31.091
and Im almost done for the day,
so whats the problem?

20:31.140 --> 20:34.189
The problem is you cant use my
kitchen for your side hustle.

20:34.230 --> 20:36.516
My side hustle?

20:36.560 --> 20:38.972
You going to tell me
that after all these years,

20:39.030 --> 20:40.679
you cant do me
this one favor?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.355
We just need
another day or two.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.810
Whos this?

20:43.860 --> 20:45.191
Im Vis assistant,
Rhonda.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.480
Exactly.

20:46.530 --> 20:48.407
Youre not my employee.

20:48.450 --> 20:51.283
Violet, shes an insurance risk.

20:51.330 --> 20:53.036
Yall got to go.

20:53.080 --> 20:56.038
-Now.
-Im telling you, Clive,

20:56.080 --> 20:57.991
you do this,
you cant take it back.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.416
Im gone for good.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.886
You know where to find
Miss Effie?

21:15.140 --> 21:17.517
Can I have these shoes,
Uncle Holleood?

21:17.560 --> 21:19.187
They light up.

21:19.230 --> 21:20.436
Oh, you can have two.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.061
-Yup.

21:24.110 --> 21:25.987
Fresh.

21:26.030 --> 21:28.407
Man, I appreciate it,
you know,

21:28.450 --> 21:30.736
but he dont need
all that.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.280
Put one back, Blue.

21:32.330 --> 21:34.207
Let the boy
have some fun.

21:34.250 --> 21:36.457
Im trying the best I can,
but hes been acting out lately.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.991
Like you was an angel
when you was his age.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.701
My daddy kept me in check.

21:40.750 --> 21:42.798
Blue...

21:42.840 --> 21:44.660
I said put them back.
What you doing?

21:44.720 --> 21:46.585
-No.

21:46.630 --> 21:48.541
-No.
-Boy, Ill snatch you

21:48.590 --> 21:50.501
in front of all these people.
Put the shoes back.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.016
Uncle Holleood
said I could have them.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.596
I dont care
what Uncle Hollywood says.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.723
I said put them back.
Put the damn shoes down.

21:58.940 --> 22:00.726
We good. We good.

22:00.770 --> 22:03.819
Thank you, but just about
to head on out.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.139
Come on.

22:07.450 --> 22:09.156
Finish this up later.

22:13.330 --> 22:14.490
Come on.

22:17.540 --> 22:18.780
-Bingo!

22:24.170 --> 22:25.910
You know kicking it
at the bingo

22:25.970 --> 22:27.756
wasnt how I planned
to celebrate.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.176
Youll be all right.

22:29.220 --> 22:30.960
You think I want
to be here looking for...

22:31.010 --> 22:32.386
There she is.

22:33.470 --> 22:36.303
Violet Bordelon.

22:36.350 --> 22:37.681
You want to use
our ovens

22:37.730 --> 22:39.846
to make money
for your business?

22:39.900 --> 22:41.765
Well, I wouldnt put it
like that.

22:41.810 --> 22:45.689
I know you dont care for me or
the other ladies in St. Agnes.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.731
But you left us.

22:47.780 --> 22:49.987
Well, in all due respect,
Miss Effie,

22:50.030 --> 22:51.657
thats not how
I remember it--

22:51.700 --> 22:53.520
Why would we want
to help you?

22:57.000 --> 23:00.072
Because I am donating

23:00.120 --> 23:04.830
10% of my profits
to the St. Agnes Society.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.047
Well...

23:08.090 --> 23:10.581
thats very generous of you...

23:11.800 --> 23:13.006
Sister Violet.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.930
Thank you, Sister Effie.

23:35.280 --> 23:40.115
You say all you want to be
Is remembered

23:40.160 --> 23:43.072
Ill make you

23:43.130 --> 23:46.588
Go down in history

23:46.630 --> 23:51.624
So you say all you want to be
Is remembered

23:51.680 --> 23:54.547
Let me make you

23:54.600 --> 23:58.388
Go down in history, baby

23:58.430 --> 24:01.684
Let me write you

24:01.730 --> 24:04.688
Into history, darling

24:04.730 --> 24:06.721
Let me sing you

24:06.770 --> 24:11.696
Into eternity

24:11.740 --> 24:15.904
So you say you just want
To be remembered

24:15.950 --> 24:19.329
You just want
To be remembered

24:19.370 --> 24:23.659
Just want to be
Remembered

24:23.710 --> 24:25.666
Sing me a word

24:25.710 --> 24:28.918
That no ones heard

24:28.960 --> 24:31.008
So lend me an ocean

24:33.050 --> 24:38.056
Make my mountain move

24:54.320 --> 24:56.447
Hey, Olivia. Its Nova.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.320
Oh, well...

25:01.290 --> 25:04.498
...|et him know Ill be in the
office in the next day or two.

25:04.540 --> 25:06.952
I want to discuss
my next story.

25:08.290 --> 25:09.621
Yeah, no.

25:09.670 --> 25:11.331
No problem.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.927
Okay, thanks.

25:17.890 --> 25:20.006
When the trumpets call

25:20.060 --> 25:23.177
You can send me
To the Lord

25:23.230 --> 25:26.893
Whatever we become

25:26.940 --> 25:28.601
Get down, you little fat...

25:30.150 --> 25:31.936
When the morning comes

25:31.980 --> 25:36.440
You can sing me
To the sun

25:36.490 --> 25:39.778
Whoa, got water

25:39.830 --> 25:42.242
Take me to space

25:45.330 --> 25:47.662
I mean, like, he was all,

25:47.710 --> 25:49.837
"I want you
to see my boat."

25:49.880 --> 25:52.587
I wanted to be like,
"Boy, bye-bye."

25:52.630 --> 25:54.291
So that fool actually think
he got a shot.

25:54.340 --> 25:56.001
If Im doing
my job right.

25:56.050 --> 25:57.836
And Im doing
my job right.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.255
Chess moves.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.589
What?

26:10.980 --> 26:14.279
Just dont want you
to forget whats real.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.560
Thats all.

26:19.120 --> 26:21.441
Hows Blue?

26:22.910 --> 26:24.946
Missing his mom.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.149
A lot.

26:27.830 --> 26:29.957
And acting out about it.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.161
Nothing I do helps.

26:32.210 --> 26:33.495
Nothing.

26:42.930 --> 26:45.387
Got me questioning
whether I could do this or not.

26:49.230 --> 26:50.686
Like, for real.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.311
Am I good for that boy?

27:01.910 --> 27:06.495
You are the best thing that ever
happened to that little boy.

27:08.410 --> 27:09.570
Appreciate it.

27:11.250 --> 27:12.456
Well, enough of this.

27:13.790 --> 27:15.587
No more Darla.

27:15.630 --> 27:17.666
No more Davis.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.371
-No more Remy.
-All right, now.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.136
To freedom,

27:22.180 --> 27:24.250
Parenthood.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.847
-All right. Yeah...

27:26.890 --> 27:28.517
Im going to go

27:31.310 --> 27:34.313
You do that.
Dance it off.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.100
I got the juice

27:36.150 --> 27:38.983
Baby, I got the juice

27:52.290 --> 27:54.781
You got to be kidding me.

27:56.460 --> 27:58.837
Your battery might be dead.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.120
What?

28:00.170 --> 28:02.752
Your battery,
it might be dead.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.506
Okay, turn it.

28:14.770 --> 28:16.476
You really didnt have
to do this.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.817
Thank you.

28:17.860 --> 28:19.316
Its okay,
its no problem.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.146
I could have got my brother
off the dance floor,

28:21.200 --> 28:23.350
but, you know,
he needed a night out.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.196
I hear that.

28:29.160 --> 28:31.867
I mean, you were having
a night out, or...?

28:31.910 --> 28:34.071
More like dinner.

28:34.130 --> 28:36.416

hes an old friend.

28:36.460 --> 28:38.496

28:38.550 --> 28:41.087

but can I give you my number?

29:26.340 --> 29:28.388
And if I dont call?

29:28.430 --> 29:30.967

30:47.550 --> 30:49.336
Thank you, baby.

30:51.430 --> 30:53.170
Why dont you go home
and get you some rest.

30:53.220 --> 30:54.676
Because you want
to be feeling good

30:54.720 --> 30:56.347
when we walk in that store
seeing these pies

30:56.390 --> 30:59.393
sitting there looking
all pretty and delicious.

31:00.940 --> 31:02.817
Congratulations, babe.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.565
Congratulations.

31:05.610 --> 31:06.770
Thank you.

31:09.490 --> 31:10.696
Ooh!

31:12.030 --> 31:14.021
Yeah, I know.
Thanks for seeing me.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.991
Whats up?

31:19.870 --> 31:22.077
You have anything to do with
that cop video getting leaked?

31:36.100 --> 31:39.137
Why should we always be
the first to forgive and forget?

31:40.600 --> 31:44.559
_ He hurt our son
in a reprehen5ible way.

31:44.610 --> 31:46.817
I wont apologize
for wanting to see him in pain.

31:46.860 --> 31:49.021
And I wont apologize for
protecting my son.

31:49.070 --> 31:50.810
Im not asking you to.

31:51.990 --> 31:53.730
-But--

31:53.780 --> 31:56.157
Has Micah seen it?
The video?

31:56.200 --> 31:58.577
Because Im wondering
if its helping or hurting.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.950
Thats all I ask.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.083
Keep him foremost
in mind, yeah?

32:45.670 --> 32:50.084
Such a waste Im waiting
Out in this space

32:52.010 --> 32:55.298
Such a waste Im waiting
Out in this

32:57.300 --> 33:02.840
Such a waste Im waiting
Out in this place

33:02.890 --> 33:07.554
Such a waste Im waiting
Out in this

33:09.110 --> 33:11.772
Ooh

33:11.820 --> 33:14.562
You waited in my mind

33:14.610 --> 33:16.020
You like them?

33:16.070 --> 33:17.230
Hmm.

33:22.580 --> 33:24.070
Theyre beautiful.

33:24.120 --> 33:27.078
Your face is
All Ive got

33:27.130 --> 33:28.779
Ooh

33:28.840 --> 33:31.411

33:31.460 --> 33:35.965
Such a waste Im waiting
Out this town

33:36.840 --> 33:38.967
Mama, I need this.

33:40.260 --> 33:41.636
Please.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.971
For_ the first time
in my life...

33:49.570 --> 33:51.140
For_the first time
in my life,

33:51.190 --> 33:54.148
I feel like I didnt have
to justify my presence.

33:56.910 --> 34:00.983
Okay? Youre... youre black,
but the son of a celebrity,

34:01.030 --> 34:03.578
so its okay.

34:03.620 --> 34:06.669
Youre black,
but you have money, so you...

34:14.420 --> 34:16.001
I feel like I belong.

34:22.100 --> 34:23.260
Okay.

34:25.390 --> 34:27.722
Well try it.

34:27.770 --> 34:30.398
For a little while.

34:30.440 --> 34:32.180
But if anything
goes wrong...

34:34.740 --> 34:35.934
Okay, thank you.

34:37.110 --> 34:38.270
Thank you.

34:46.830 --> 34:49.071
-Made your mama cry.

34:50.830 --> 34:52.707
-This is beautiful.
-Thank you.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.310
Pop.

35:17.280 --> 35:19.316
Is time

35:20.660 --> 35:22.025
Yeah, its over.

35:28.750 --> 35:30.365
Im sorry I was being bad.

35:35.170 --> 35:37.627
Definitely was acting
brand-new.

35:37.670 --> 35:40.298
But you aint got
a bad bone in your body.

35:40.340 --> 35:41.637
You hear me?

35:41.680 --> 35:42.965
Yeah.

35:44.470 --> 35:46.051
Can I help?

36:10.120 --> 36:12.281
Oh, hey.

36:12.330 --> 36:14.412
Hey, Viclq.
Good to see you.

36:14.460 --> 36:16.291
You too.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.739
Here.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.928
So I take it that youre happy
with the way things turned out.

36:24.930 --> 36:28.309
Id be happier if hed left
my son alone in the first place.

36:28.350 --> 36:31.558
But some measure of justice
is being served,

36:31.600 --> 36:34.683
even if it did need
a little push.

36:34.730 --> 36:36.937
Im just glad that things
are coming to light.

36:36.980 --> 36:39.278
So, in other news...

36:41.400 --> 36:43.152
Follow the money,

36:43.200 --> 36:45.737
and youll find out
all their dirty little secrets.

36:45.780 --> 36:48.738
Lo and behold, Sam Landrys
been drowning in debt

36:48.790 --> 36:50.326
for the last two years.

36:50.370 --> 36:52.861
Wait, what?

36:52.920 --> 36:56.208
Why would they buy Queen Sugar
if funds are tight?

36:56.250 --> 36:58.127
I... I dont know.
But I can tell you this.

36:58.170 --> 37:00.912
They got a team of lawyers
tighter than Fort Knox.

37:03.840 --> 37:07.674
This is good. Any news
on the rest of the shareholders?

37:07.720 --> 37:09.847
No. II! have something

37:09.890 --> 37:11.266
Just you wait.

37:13.890 --> 37:15.846
Yall did not
have to do this.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.299
Woman, was is you saying?

37:17.360 --> 37:18.759
You know youre loving
this attention.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.776
What he said! What he said!

37:20.820 --> 37:23.027
Hey, stop.

37:23.070 --> 37:25.106
You cant barely stop smiling.
Is your face hurting yet?

37:26.620 --> 37:28.611
Yes?

37:28.660 --> 37:31.322
-Oh, yeah.

37:31.370 --> 37:33.577
Which way we going?

37:39.090 --> 37:40.489
Is this the right spot?

37:40.550 --> 37:43.087
Thats where the man
said theyd be.

37:55.940 --> 37:59.398
No, stop. This--
this is not right.

37:59.440 --> 38:01.351
Excuse me, baby.

38:03.820 --> 38:06.653
My pies are supposed
to be on the central display,

38:06.700 --> 38:07.985
and theyre not.

38:08.030 --> 38:09.566
Is Mr. Rawlings here?

38:09.620 --> 38:11.861
Hes already left
for the day.

38:11.910 --> 38:13.787
Okay, well, baby,
we got a problem,

38:13.830 --> 38:17.573
because my pies
are not on the right display.

38:17.620 --> 38:19.281
If you wait right here,
I can give him a call.

38:19.330 --> 38:20.991
What was your name?

38:21.040 --> 38:22.450
Vis Pies.

38:24.420 --> 38:25.751
Thank you.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.686
Come on, yall.
Come on.

38:40.730 --> 38:42.186
-I got it.
And we got you.

38:42.230 --> 38:43.720
Please.

38:46.650 --> 38:48.311
There, I got you.

38:52.740 --> 38:54.788
All right, lets do this.

39:00.790 --> 39:02.530
That looks good.

39:06.670 --> 39:08.547
I got it, I got it,
I got it.

39:31.410 --> 39:33.321
I know its a little thing.

39:35.410 --> 39:37.287
But its my little thing.

39:40.330 --> 39:42.241
Im almost 60 years old,

39:42.290 --> 39:44.793
and I will not be sidelined,

39:44.840 --> 39:47.832
sidetracked
or sidestepped.

39:50.970 --> 39:53.848
Or put in a damn corner
and told to wait my turn.

39:53.890 --> 39:56.256
Not another day.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.130
Its my time.

40:03.480 --> 40:04.970
Its my time.

40:12.450 --> 40:14.566
I had a crazy dream...

40:14.620 --> 40:16.656
Nova.
-Steve. I--

40:16.700 --> 40:18.941
Im glad to hear that
youre working on a new story.

40:20.250 --> 40:21.456
I know its hard.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.865
But well ride this one out,

40:22.920 --> 40:24.410
get you back
to where you belong

40:24.460 --> 40:25.745
as soon as its possible.

40:25.790 --> 40:27.337
Thank you, Steve.

40:27.380 --> 40:29.917
But Ive reconsidered.

40:29.970 --> 40:31.756
Reconsidered?

40:31.800 --> 40:36.134
I woke up feeling like
This thing was real

40:36.180 --> 40:39.138
Because to my mind

40:39.180 --> 40:41.557
It did appeal

40:41.600 --> 40:44.091
It stuck with me all day

40:44.150 --> 40:46.562
My soul it did excite

40:46.610 --> 40:50.523
I wish youd understand
The way I feel

40:50.570 --> 40:55.269
What is life
Without these dreams?

40:55.320 --> 41:00.246
Sights that make reality

41:00.290 --> 41:05.739
All that we
May see or seem

41:05.790 --> 41:10.329
Is a dream within a dream

41:10.380 --> 41:15.079
What is life
Without these dreams?

41:15.140 --> 41:19.964
Sights that make reality

41:20.020 --> 41:25.048
All that we
May see or seem

41:25.100 --> 41:29.969
Is a dream within a dream
