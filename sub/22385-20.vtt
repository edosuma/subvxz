WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:04.801
Ganzman is dead,

00:04.837 --> 00:06.136
the sonic weapon
is destroyed,

00:06.172 --> 00:08.372
and you have the audacity
to tell me to calm down?

00:08.408 --> 00:09.876
The plan is over!

00:11.010 --> 00:12.343
They're flying in
as we speak,

00:12.379 --> 00:15.046
and thanks to you,
we have nothing!

00:15.082 --> 00:17.180
Crawford should've never
trusted you with this.

00:17.216 --> 00:18.816
We don't have nothing,
we have a Plan B

00:18.852 --> 00:20.150
that is very much
in motion.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.019
So if you would be so kind
as to let me do my thing...

00:22.055 --> 00:23.253
Why don't you stop
playing with your toys?

00:23.289 --> 00:24.354
Tell me what Plan B

00:24.390 --> 00:25.523
you could possibly have...

00:25.559 --> 00:28.092
I need you
to watch your tone.

00:28.128 --> 00:30.394
I have less than 24 hours
to make this work.

00:30.430 --> 00:35.032
So, I need you to provide me
with everything that I ask for.

00:35.068 --> 00:37.167
And the first thing
that I need is for you

00:37.203 --> 00:40.036
to leave this room
right now.

00:40.072 --> 00:42.039
You have 12 hours

00:42.075 --> 00:46.276
to show me something
that boosts my confidence...

00:46.312 --> 00:48.416
or I pull the plug.

00:56.989 --> 00:58.526
Sure you have
enough guns?

01:04.197 --> 01:05.563
It's not gonna work.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.064
Because I'm not
really here.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.935
I know it looks like I'm here,
but you and I both know

01:10.971 --> 01:13.007
I'm just your mind
playing tricks on you.

01:14.841 --> 01:17.441
Don't look at me
like that.

01:17.477 --> 01:18.975
They told you
this was coming.

01:19.011 --> 01:19.980
You're sick.

01:22.382 --> 01:24.852
Now, put the gun down,
and let's talk.

01:29.388 --> 01:30.588
So, how was your flight?

01:30.624 --> 01:33.224
Oh, long.
Turbulent.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.826
Kind of like
the trip itself.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.960
Oh, well, you're brave
for even going down there.

01:36.996 --> 01:39.831
El Paso is crawling
with ICE agents.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.498
Imagine if one of 'em
asked you for your papers.

01:41.534 --> 01:43.400
I was doing my job.

01:43.436 --> 01:46.337
Okay, well,
I am really glad

01:46.373 --> 01:47.438
that you're home.

01:47.474 --> 01:50.007
Well, me too.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.579
Mm.

01:52.511 --> 01:54.879
Did you call Richard?

01:54.915 --> 01:55.980
Who's Richard?

01:56.016 --> 01:56.980
The caterer.

01:57.016 --> 01:59.951
Oh, we have to finalize
the appetizer menu or...

01:59.987 --> 02:02.252
Babe, I haven't seen you
in three weeks.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.921
Seriously, this is what
you really wanna talk about?

02:04.957 --> 02:08.091
You haven't wanted to talk
about anything wedding-related

02:08.127 --> 02:09.926
since before I left.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.495
If this is freaking you out,
then maybe it's a sign

02:12.531 --> 02:14.297
that we should
slow things down...

02:14.333 --> 02:16.132
No, no-no-no,
no slowdown, listen,

02:16.168 --> 02:19.337
I've just been busy
and focused on work.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.537
Let's start over.

02:20.573 --> 02:22.138
I'll take you
to a very nice lunch.

02:22.174 --> 02:25.476
And then immediately after,
I promise I will call Robert.

02:25.512 --> 02:28.012
- Richard.
- Like I said, Richard.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.180
And then I'm gonna
call the florist...

02:30.216 --> 02:31.615
Mm-hmm?

02:31.651 --> 02:33.149
And then
the photographer...

02:33.185 --> 02:34.417
Uh-huh?

02:34.453 --> 02:36.186
- Mmm.
- Oh!

02:36.222 --> 02:37.287
And my mother.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.123
Okay, you're terrible

02:39.159 --> 02:41.258
at this whole wedding planning
dirty talk thing.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.433
Avery?
You want breakfast?

02:51.470 --> 02:53.240
Avery?

02:58.178 --> 03:00.111
Kurt? Kurt?

03:00.147 --> 03:02.980
- What's wrong?
- She's gone, she's not in her room.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.448
If this is Roman,
I swear...

03:05.484 --> 03:07.621
Don't panic,
I'll call her detail.

03:10.089 --> 03:11.321
Where the hell
have you been?

03:11.357 --> 03:13.256
Buying bagels.
Is that okay?

03:13.292 --> 03:14.926
No! No, it's not okay.

03:14.962 --> 03:17.127
If you wanna leave this house,
you have to tell us.

03:17.163 --> 03:18.561
The bodega's, like,
half a block from here.

03:18.597 --> 03:19.930
I really have
to tell you when I go...

03:19.966 --> 03:21.464
Yes! As long as
Roman's out there,

03:21.500 --> 03:22.966
you cannot come
and go as you please.

03:23.002 --> 03:24.201
You don't think
I know that?

03:24.237 --> 03:25.602
Look, we know
how hard this has been.

03:25.638 --> 03:27.338
No, I don't think you do.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.672
We just want you
to be safe.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.641
You said this would
feel like a home.

03:30.677 --> 03:33.214
But it's just the same cell
with different wallpaper.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.588
Hey, you wanted to see me?

03:44.624 --> 03:46.624
Have you fixed
the tattoo database yet?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.591
No, it just happened
last night.

03:48.627 --> 03:50.695
Roman is triggering
all of the tattoos

03:50.731 --> 03:52.463
externally
with false alarms,

03:52.499 --> 03:54.097
so it's gonna take
a minute to solve.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.632
- It's my job to ask.
- I know.

03:55.668 --> 03:58.501
I'm close-ish.
I just need a day.

03:58.537 --> 03:59.637
Or two.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.972
Two and three-quarters
would be great.

04:02.008 --> 04:03.673
- Have you looped Rich in?
- Why would I do that?

04:03.709 --> 04:05.409
An outside opinion
couldn't hurt.

04:05.445 --> 04:06.444
If I needed
an outside opinion,

04:06.480 --> 04:07.978
I would just call my dad.

04:08.014 --> 04:10.513
The database is based
on his algorithm, so...

04:10.549 --> 04:11.582
Great, bring him in.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.551
Uh, no.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.719
That's not what I meant...

04:14.755 --> 04:16.152
Why not? You just said
he was an expert.

04:16.188 --> 04:18.522
Come on, would you bring
your mom in to work?

04:18.558 --> 04:20.257
If she could get
the tattoo database fixed,

04:20.293 --> 04:21.257
you damn straight.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.563
What's that? Another one
of Roman's false alarms?

04:25.599 --> 04:28.332
No, it's about Avery's dad.

04:28.368 --> 04:30.067
We were wrong.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.536
Avery's father didn't
commit suicide.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.505
Wait, what?
He left a note.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.106
- It was on...
- It was fake.

04:36.142 --> 04:39.010
His body washed up last night
in Sackets Harbor.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.310
Robert Drabkin died of

04:40.346 --> 04:42.245
multiple bullet wounds
to the chest.

04:42.281 --> 04:43.514
He was murdered.

04:43.550 --> 04:44.647
By Crawford?

04:44.683 --> 04:46.183
Not directly,
but that'd be my guess.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.685
He had dirt in his pores,
consistent with burial,

04:48.721 --> 04:52.156
but he also had
cryogenic markers in his cells.

04:52.192 --> 04:55.026
Suggesting that he was
subsequently frozen.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.361
You're saying he was buried,
dug up, put on ice,

04:57.397 --> 04:59.697
- then dumped into the harbor?
- It would appear so.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.132
That's gotta be Roman.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.666
My hunch is that
he put Drabkin on ice

05:03.702 --> 05:05.135
to preserve the evidence.

05:05.171 --> 05:07.171
In order to point us
to whoever murdered him.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.205
But why now? He just
tried to have us killed.

05:09.241 --> 05:11.075
He must've dumped it
before he turned.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.442
Bingo...
the coroner thinks

05:12.478 --> 05:14.178
Drabkin's been in the water
for about a week.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.346
I want a full autopsy
done by us.

05:16.382 --> 05:18.815
Already on it, the body is en
route to the morgue as we speak.

05:18.851 --> 05:20.450
What do you wanna
tell Avery?

05:20.486 --> 05:21.818
Right now, nothing.

05:21.854 --> 05:24.154
Let's just see
what the autopsy says.

05:24.190 --> 05:27.158
Avery deserves answers,
not another round of what-ifs.

05:27.194 --> 05:28.392
Yeah.

05:28.428 --> 05:31.628
C.O.D.... bullet wounds
to the thoracic cavity.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.296
Those are
eight months old.

05:33.332 --> 05:35.298
But... this...

05:35.334 --> 05:39.336
ultraviolet throat tattoo
was added posthumously.

05:39.372 --> 05:40.637
The Sackets Harbor coroner

05:40.673 --> 05:42.339
didn't mention anything
about a UV tattoo.

05:42.375 --> 05:45.241
Yeah, real crack team
they got down there.

05:45.277 --> 05:46.610
I have the same tattoo.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.344
This is definitely Roman.

05:48.380 --> 05:52.450
Wait, what if he's pointing us
to a clue inside Drabkin's body?

05:52.486 --> 05:55.255
Care to do the honors?

06:06.599 --> 06:08.802
Oh, yeah,
there's something in here.

06:16.342 --> 06:18.541
My brother really has
a flair for the dramatic.

06:18.577 --> 06:21.114
What do
those lines mean?

06:22.548 --> 06:24.180
All right.

06:24.216 --> 06:26.483
This key completes
your tattoo.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.618
The skull has
key-shaped eye sockets.

06:28.654 --> 06:33.393
Yeah. And now, if we fill
in the negative spaces...

06:35.295 --> 06:37.193
- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

06:37.229 --> 06:40.330
The key plus the tattoo
forms Greek letters.

06:40.366 --> 06:42.666
They spell "Charon,"
from Greek mythology.

06:42.702 --> 06:45.336
The ferryman who brings
the dead to the underworld.

06:45.372 --> 06:48.171
It's also the alias for
a notorious contract killer.

06:48.207 --> 06:49.539
Yeah. He's never been ID'd.

06:49.575 --> 06:52.209
The Bureau has been
tracking him for decades.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.146
So Roman's saying Charon
killed Avery's father.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.380
And countless others.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.414
If we figure out
what this opens,

06:58.450 --> 07:01.752
this could literally be
the key to taking him down...

07:01.788 --> 07:04.387
before he kills anyone else.

07:09.639 --> 07:14.639
Subtitles by explosiveskull

07:15.686 --> 07:18.187
So we think Crawford
ordered the hit on Drabkin,

07:18.223 --> 07:20.088
but Charon
pulled the trigger.

07:20.124 --> 07:21.624
Okay, what about this key?
Are we any closer

07:21.660 --> 07:23.292
to figuring out
what it's for?

07:23.328 --> 07:24.761
I figured out what it opens.

07:24.797 --> 07:28.297
It's for Locker 117
at CUNY Law School.

07:28.333 --> 07:30.098
I mean, it makes
sense he'd use a dead drop.

07:30.134 --> 07:32.100
Apparently he never meets
his clients in person.

07:32.136 --> 07:33.735
That's why nobody knows
what he looks like.

07:33.771 --> 07:36.304
So Roman ID'd
his dead drop box.

07:36.340 --> 07:38.206
This could be the last real hint
we ever get from him.

07:38.242 --> 07:40.776
So we'll send in our bomb robot,
monitor the perimeter,

07:40.812 --> 07:42.578
and make sure it's clear
before we move in.

07:42.614 --> 07:44.083
Zapata should stay behind.

07:45.150 --> 07:45.848
Why?

07:45.884 --> 07:48.184
Charon works
internationally too.

07:48.220 --> 07:50.119
I'm sure the CIA
has files on him.

07:50.155 --> 07:52.187
Maybe something there
can help us.

07:52.223 --> 07:54.122
That is,
assuming that you

07:54.158 --> 07:55.795
would actually share
the intel with us.

07:58.864 --> 08:01.463
The locker could be nothing.

08:01.499 --> 08:04.466
If you could pull the CIA files,
that'd be a big help.

08:04.502 --> 08:05.670
Fine.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.540
Okay.

08:10.576 --> 08:12.508
Jane, you coming?

08:12.544 --> 08:16.249
No. There's something
I have to do.

08:17.648 --> 08:20.482
It was Crawford, wasn't it?

08:20.518 --> 08:22.218
He killed my dad.

08:22.254 --> 08:26.355
We believe he ordered
the hit, yes.

08:26.391 --> 08:30.362
Avery... I'm so sorry.

08:31.663 --> 08:33.663
Your father's body
is at the FBI morgue,

08:33.698 --> 08:36.432
if you'd like to see him,
say goodbye.

08:36.467 --> 08:38.768
Where is this hit man now?

08:38.804 --> 08:41.571
The team's trying
to locate him.

08:41.607 --> 08:44.507
Good.

08:44.543 --> 08:46.241
We find that assassin
and we use him.

08:46.277 --> 08:48.577
He can testify
against Crawford in court.

08:48.613 --> 08:50.682
This is how
we bring Crawford down.

08:53.819 --> 08:58.754
Tasha! God, it feels like
it's been ten years!

08:58.790 --> 09:00.222
How are you?

09:00.258 --> 09:03.625
Uh, fine. Busy.

09:03.661 --> 09:05.228
Reade's not here, he's...

09:05.264 --> 09:07.897
I know. We had lunch plans,
and he canceled.

09:07.933 --> 09:10.166
Uhh! Well, anyway,
I can't wait 'til

09:10.202 --> 09:11.801
we're done planning
this damn wedding.

09:11.837 --> 09:15.671
Totally. And...

09:15.707 --> 09:17.406
I'm so sorry
I can't come.

09:17.442 --> 09:20.146
Wait. What?

09:21.914 --> 09:24.147
But you're his best man.
You have to.

09:24.183 --> 09:26.819
I thought
Reade told you, I...

09:28.819 --> 09:31.720
I have this CIA thing.
It's an op.

09:31.756 --> 09:32.889
And I can't really say
that much about it.

09:32.925 --> 09:34.923
I'm actually doing
a report on it now.

09:34.959 --> 09:38.430
But it was really good
to see you, okay?

09:44.770 --> 09:46.335
There wasn't a bomb
in the locker.

09:46.371 --> 09:48.336
But we did find that.

09:48.372 --> 09:49.772
You think Charon
was watching you?

09:49.808 --> 09:51.706
No, the camera feed
was already disconnected

09:51.742 --> 09:53.176
by the time we got there.

09:53.212 --> 09:54.710
But we do think that
Charon was using that

09:54.746 --> 09:56.678
to vet potential clients every
time they opened the locker,

09:56.714 --> 09:58.446
making sure they weren't cops.

09:58.482 --> 10:01.316
Until Roman warned him the
dead drop had been compromised.

10:01.352 --> 10:03.719
You think you can reconstruct where
this camera was transmitting to?

10:03.755 --> 10:06.288
I can certainly try.

10:06.324 --> 10:08.858
"Do or do not.

10:08.894 --> 10:10.560
There is no try."

10:10.596 --> 10:11.961
Hi, Dad.

10:11.997 --> 10:14.496
Wait, what? That's Bill Nye,
The Science Guy.

10:14.532 --> 10:15.932
Yeah. Also known
as my father.

10:15.968 --> 10:17.799
So, Dad, I would
like you to meet...

10:17.835 --> 10:21.470
I'm K-Kurt Weller, sir.
I'm... I'm a huge fan.

10:21.506 --> 10:22.871
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

10:22.907 --> 10:26.441
Wait. But why are
your last names different?

10:26.477 --> 10:28.945
Oh, uh, her mother
and I decided that,

10:28.981 --> 10:32.315
if we had a boy, he would take
his dad's last name.

10:32.351 --> 10:35.884
If we had a girl, she would
get her mom's last name.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.754
So, a Patterson gave birth
to a Patterson.

10:39.857 --> 10:40.889
Who is this guy?

10:40.925 --> 10:42.858
He's a really
famous scientist.

10:42.894 --> 10:44.893
I'm sorry, sir.
She has memory issues.

10:44.929 --> 10:48.364
Whoa! Since when are you
so interested in science?

10:48.400 --> 10:51.667
You never care how I solve
any of these tattoos.

10:51.703 --> 10:53.369
I know, but he
makes science fun.

10:53.405 --> 10:54.736
Okay, well,
that's super hurtful.

10:54.772 --> 10:56.571
This is everything
the CIA has on...

10:56.607 --> 10:57.873
- Bill!
- Tasha!

10:57.909 --> 10:59.908
- Hi! What are you doing here?
- Wow!

10:59.944 --> 11:02.378
You knew Patterson's dad
was Bill Nye, The Science Guy?

11:02.414 --> 11:03.745
Yeah, we had
dinner once.

11:03.781 --> 11:06.548
Look, my Dad is here
because he designed

11:06.584 --> 11:09.018
the algorithm that I used to
build the tattoo database.

11:09.054 --> 11:11.720
You could call it
"the Dad-a-base."

11:13.724 --> 11:15.758
You're exactly
like your father.

11:15.794 --> 11:17.460
No, no,
opposite, opposite.

11:17.496 --> 11:19.294
Oh, my God.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.831
All right. Anyway,
as fun as this is,

11:21.867 --> 11:23.365
I gotta get to work
on this camera.

11:23.401 --> 11:25.735
And I guess I've got
an algorithm to retool.

11:25.771 --> 11:27.802
Uh, do you want help
with that, sir?

11:27.838 --> 11:29.605
How would you even
help with that?

11:29.641 --> 11:30.873
Well, I could...

11:30.909 --> 11:32.508
I could hand him the tools
or whatever.

11:32.544 --> 11:34.476
- I could help you.
- I think he's got it.

11:34.512 --> 11:35.580
Okay.

11:37.482 --> 11:39.315
That guy's a little odd.

11:39.351 --> 11:40.352
Yeah.

11:41.987 --> 11:44.419
Babe, didn't you
get my text?

11:44.455 --> 11:45.857
Why isn't Tasha coming
to the wedding?

11:48.827 --> 11:50.493
Edgar, what's going on?

11:50.529 --> 11:54.730
I should have
told you sooner, but...

11:54.766 --> 11:55.934
But what?

11:57.769 --> 11:59.639
Tasha told me
she has feelings for me.

12:03.474 --> 12:05.707
And you chose
not to tell me?

12:05.743 --> 12:07.312
You were away. I...

12:11.949 --> 12:13.948
Meg...

12:13.984 --> 12:18.988
I... I don't want to
talk about this now.

12:19.024 --> 12:20.855
- Not here.
- All right, fine.

12:20.891 --> 12:22.858
Just don't follow me.

12:22.894 --> 12:25.298
I need some time.

12:31.837 --> 12:33.502
You know,
I think you're taller.

12:33.538 --> 12:36.438
Dad, that's not
even possible.

12:36.474 --> 12:38.039
How's Mom?

12:38.075 --> 12:39.874
I don't want to
talk about it.

12:39.910 --> 12:41.976
Wait, what?
Talk about what?

12:42.012 --> 12:45.380
- Your mother. I don't want to talk about it.
- Dad.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.716
Besides, we're got
a lot of work to do.

12:47.752 --> 12:50.119
Okay.

12:50.155 --> 12:52.421
Uh, I can
figure this out.

12:52.457 --> 12:55.990
I've got some
highly suspect traffic

12:56.026 --> 12:57.826
on the Port Authority's
router,

12:57.862 --> 12:59.028
which has to be Charon,

12:59.064 --> 13:02.398
but it is highly encrypted.

13:02.434 --> 13:06.435
I remember when you first
asked me about condensation.

13:06.471 --> 13:07.937
You couldn't figure out
how the water

13:07.973 --> 13:09.971
got from the inside
of your glass

13:10.007 --> 13:12.073
to the outside of your glass,

13:12.109 --> 13:13.875
and I explained
it's a process.

13:13.911 --> 13:16.412
Water vapor
is an invisible gas,

13:16.448 --> 13:18.748
and when it comes in contact
with a cool surface

13:18.784 --> 13:20.115
like the outside
of this beaker...

13:20.151 --> 13:22.650
Yes, Dad. The molecules
draw closer together,

13:22.686 --> 13:23.952
creating condensation.

13:23.988 --> 13:25.988
It's obvious you're
trying to distract me.

13:26.024 --> 13:28.990
Obvious?
I've never been obvious.

13:29.026 --> 13:30.658
It's been like that
since high school.

13:30.694 --> 13:32.394
Whenever I would get
stuck on a problem,

13:32.430 --> 13:33.629
you would try to distract me

13:33.665 --> 13:35.998
by giving me something
to focus on,

13:36.034 --> 13:37.533
and then whenever
I would turn back

13:37.569 --> 13:39.137
to whatever
I was working on...

13:40.038 --> 13:41.570
Oh, my God.

13:44.675 --> 13:47.042
The camera is programmed
to send a feed

13:47.078 --> 13:48.811
to Little's Comics in Queens.

13:48.847 --> 13:49.945
Which means
he might be there.

13:49.981 --> 13:51.013
We storm the shop.

13:51.049 --> 13:52.681
And take Charon alive.

13:52.717 --> 13:53.883
He's how we get Crawford.

13:53.919 --> 13:55.453
Let's move.

13:59.190 --> 14:00.556
Show me your hands!

14:00.592 --> 14:02.957
FBI! On your knees.
Hands behind your head.

14:02.993 --> 14:04.560
Is anybody else
in here with you?

14:04.596 --> 14:06.829
No. Yes.
The owner's upstairs.

14:06.865 --> 14:08.667
Back there.

14:09.733 --> 14:10.703
Don't move.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.105
Come on. Let's go.
Tasha!

14:17.141 --> 14:18.511
Charon's upstairs.

14:25.817 --> 14:27.086
Stop! FBI!

14:35.827 --> 14:36.991
Don't move!

14:40.966 --> 14:42.635
Uhh!

14:59.950 --> 15:01.584
We find that assassin
and we use him.

15:01.620 --> 15:03.619
He can testify against
Crawford in court.

15:03.655 --> 15:07.559
No. No. No.

15:10.261 --> 15:12.628
I'm sorry. I... I just...
I didn't have a choice.

15:12.664 --> 15:14.996
- I know.
- He was our one shot at finding Crawford.

15:15.032 --> 15:16.534
Now he's dead.

15:24.443 --> 15:28.783
Hmm. That's not gonna
make me go away.

15:32.519 --> 15:36.053
So... why are you
helping Crawford?

15:36.089 --> 15:37.353
You hate him, remember?

15:37.389 --> 15:39.790
I'm not having
this conversation.

15:39.826 --> 15:41.992
You're just gonna throw away
everything you worked for?

15:42.028 --> 15:45.262
Look at the world we live in.
Look how broken it is.

15:45.298 --> 15:47.765
How many people have
the power or the money

15:47.801 --> 15:52.136
or the vision...
to actually fix it?

15:52.172 --> 15:54.271
Crawford does.
His plan could...

15:54.307 --> 15:55.739
What about your plan?

15:55.775 --> 15:58.074
Helping the FBI
take down Crawford,

15:58.110 --> 16:00.877
exacting your revenge?

16:00.913 --> 16:03.848
I don't need it anymore.
I have something better.

16:03.884 --> 16:07.284
What? A family?

16:07.320 --> 16:09.152
Hank Crawford
is not your father.

16:09.188 --> 16:10.488
You think
I don't know that?

16:10.524 --> 16:12.757
Then why are you
helping him?

16:12.793 --> 16:14.023
Because you think
he loves you?

16:14.059 --> 16:15.959
He cares more about me
than you do!

16:15.995 --> 16:18.963
No one cares more
about you than I do!

16:18.999 --> 16:20.396
Don't forget that.

16:20.432 --> 16:21.531
Oh, my God.

16:21.567 --> 16:24.804
Will you guys stop?

16:26.038 --> 16:29.342
You're yelling about
loving each other.

16:30.376 --> 16:32.346
It's getting
a little crowded in here.

16:38.317 --> 16:40.016
I don't want to talk
about this.

16:40.052 --> 16:43.490
Well, we're both here,
so it looks like you do.

16:48.061 --> 16:49.794
Your boss was
a contract killer,

16:49.830 --> 16:51.161
one of the best
there ever was.

16:51.197 --> 16:53.063
What? Ernie?

16:53.099 --> 16:54.364
He's known as Charon.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.199
He's been on our most wanted
list for years.

16:56.235 --> 16:58.502
And as far as we're concerned,
you're his accomplice.

16:58.538 --> 17:00.804
If I were you,
I'd start talking.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.272
What do you want to know?

17:02.308 --> 17:06.041
Based on the number of hits
that Ernie has carried out,

17:06.078 --> 17:07.477
he'd have a lot of cash.

17:07.512 --> 17:09.046
Is there a safe
at the shop?

17:09.082 --> 17:10.079
No.

17:10.115 --> 17:11.214
Okay, what about
at home?

17:11.250 --> 17:12.883
Probably.

17:12.919 --> 17:14.851
I mean, I know he has
lots of high-value comics,

17:14.887 --> 17:16.453
like mint-condition ones
from the '30s.

17:16.489 --> 17:18.088
How much could
those be worth?

17:18.124 --> 17:20.390
Some of those titles are worth,
like, half a mil each.

17:20.425 --> 17:21.925
I thought he had
a trust fund or something.

17:21.961 --> 17:24.060
He could have been
paid in comics.

17:24.096 --> 17:26.396
Do you remember any
of those comic's titles?

17:26.432 --> 17:28.866
Do mushrooms make
Mario bigger? Heh.

17:28.902 --> 17:29.500
What?

17:29.536 --> 17:31.902
Uh, yes,
I know them all.

17:31.938 --> 17:33.236
Great,
we'll have Patterson

17:33.272 --> 17:34.405
trace the provenance
of these comics

17:34.441 --> 17:36.005
and find the prior owners.

17:36.041 --> 17:39.112
And then use that to work out
who ordered these hits.

17:42.982 --> 17:44.481
You don't have to
comb through all if this

17:44.517 --> 17:45.582
if you don't want to.

17:45.618 --> 17:47.984
I want to.
I want to help.

17:49.521 --> 17:52.289
Oh, it's my godmother.
I should...

17:52.325 --> 17:54.094
Um, I'll give you a minute.

17:57.130 --> 17:59.163
Lynnette, how are you?

17:59.199 --> 18:03.000
Avery, honey, it is... it's
so nice to hear your voice.

18:03.036 --> 18:06.537
I've been meaning to call.
Really. How's Adam?

18:06.573 --> 18:08.204
<i>Well, he loves Brown.</i>

18:08.240 --> 18:09.406
That's great.

18:09.442 --> 18:10.573
<i>So, listen,</i>

18:10.609 --> 18:13.010
as the executor
of your father's estate,

18:13.046 --> 18:14.611
I receive word
of anything, you know,

18:14.647 --> 18:16.379
pertaining to his assets.

18:16.415 --> 18:18.883
<i>Avery, I'm so sorry.</i>

18:18.919 --> 18:21.618
Thanks.
But this is easier.

18:21.654 --> 18:23.419
At least I know
he didn't hurt himself.

18:23.455 --> 18:25.356
Right.

18:25.392 --> 18:27.558
Well, your dad left

18:27.594 --> 18:31.227
a very generous
life insurance policy,

18:31.263 --> 18:32.896
<i>and you're entitled to it.</i>

18:32.932 --> 18:34.531
You just have to sign
some papers.

18:34.567 --> 18:39.168
Yeah. I...
I'll let you know.

18:39.204 --> 18:40.337
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

18:40.373 --> 18:42.442
I gotta go.

18:47.413 --> 18:49.083
Are you okay?

18:51.951 --> 18:53.953
I want to see my dad.

18:56.623 --> 18:58.454
I don't want his money.

18:58.490 --> 19:02.659
The things he did
for Crawford...

19:02.695 --> 19:05.329
the lives he destroyed...

19:05.365 --> 19:07.231
He's still your Dad.

19:07.267 --> 19:09.269
You're allowed
to miss him.

19:11.037 --> 19:14.008
That's the worst part...
I do.

19:15.208 --> 19:18.045
I love him and hate him
all at the same time.

19:19.144 --> 19:22.111
That's how I used to
feel about Roman.

19:22.147 --> 19:25.081
The people
that you love the most

19:25.117 --> 19:27.518
are also the people that
can hurt you the worst.

19:27.554 --> 19:29.619
But if you take
that inheritance,

19:29.655 --> 19:31.955
you'll make
something of it,

19:31.991 --> 19:34.193
because you're
not your dad.

19:38.731 --> 19:40.630
I guess I should
go sign those papers.

19:40.666 --> 19:44.170
Okay.
Can I come with you?

19:45.270 --> 19:46.235
Yeah.

19:46.271 --> 19:48.942
I'll let the team know.

20:03.423 --> 20:05.025
Can we please talk?

20:06.159 --> 20:08.091
You have every right
to be mad,

20:08.127 --> 20:10.226
and I should have told you
as soon as she told me.

20:10.262 --> 20:11.662
But you didn't.

20:11.698 --> 20:13.297
And I know why.

20:13.333 --> 20:15.465
You clearly needed space
to consider your options.

20:15.501 --> 20:17.134
There's no other option!

20:17.170 --> 20:19.273
Are you telling me that you have
never had feelings for Tasha?

20:27.680 --> 20:31.751
You're right.
We should talk.

20:33.353 --> 20:36.552
So, I just got off
the phone with Mom,

20:36.588 --> 20:39.156
and I think you're
being a total baby.

20:39.192 --> 20:40.790
I am not!

20:40.826 --> 20:43.027
Wait. I know
how that sounded.

20:43.063 --> 20:44.560
Dad, I was scared.
I thought you guys

20:44.596 --> 20:45.762
were having a real fight.

20:45.798 --> 20:48.264
We are having
a real fight, okay?

20:48.300 --> 20:51.100
Your mother is
going to publish a paper

20:51.136 --> 20:53.669
with none other
than Dr. Rodney McKay.

20:53.705 --> 20:55.438
He's my academic rival.

20:55.474 --> 20:57.774
Dad, that's crazy.

20:57.810 --> 21:00.577
Mom can conduct research
with whomever she wants,

21:00.613 --> 21:01.779
including Professor Mc...

21:01.815 --> 21:03.579
- Don't even say his name!
- Are you serious?

21:03.615 --> 21:05.581
Yeah, I'm serious!

21:05.617 --> 21:07.150
That guy is
my lifelong nemesis.

21:07.186 --> 21:10.287
We're like, uh,
Edison and Tesla

21:10.323 --> 21:11.687
or Newton and Leibniz.

21:11.723 --> 21:13.756
Yeah, except you're
not Isaac Newton.

21:13.792 --> 21:15.591
You think
I'm Gottfried Leibniz?!

21:15.627 --> 21:17.427
That's... no.
Don't turn a small thing

21:17.463 --> 21:19.562
into a big thing...
you need to call Mom.

21:19.598 --> 21:22.232
Seriously, she's just
doing her job.

21:22.268 --> 21:23.300
I'll consider it.

21:23.336 --> 21:26.736
Was there anything useful
in those Charon files?

21:26.772 --> 21:28.739
Uh, I don't know.
I haven't looked at it yet.

21:31.211 --> 21:34.080
You know, I think I will
check on your mom.

21:37.784 --> 21:41.518
Those are the title cards
for those comics.

21:41.554 --> 21:43.520
If we find Crawford's
name on there,

21:43.556 --> 21:45.822
then we can prove
that he hired Charon

21:45.858 --> 21:47.523
to kill Avery's father.

21:47.559 --> 21:48.791
Yeah.

21:48.827 --> 21:51.794
Who'd pay 400 grand
for a picture book?

21:51.830 --> 21:53.362
That's Flash Comics #1.

21:53.398 --> 21:56.202
It's kind of a big deal.
Wait, Lynnette Belmont?

21:58.270 --> 22:00.471
Who's Lynnette Belmont?

22:00.507 --> 22:02.172
That's Avery's godmother

22:02.208 --> 22:04.741
and the executor of
the Drabkin estate.

22:04.777 --> 22:06.510
You think
she ordered his hit?

22:06.546 --> 22:10.284
I don't know, but Jane and
Avery are with her right now.

22:14.488 --> 22:15.854
Here, let me
take those for you.

22:15.890 --> 22:18.324
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

22:18.360 --> 22:21.693
God, this place is
exactly how I remember it.

22:21.729 --> 22:23.996
Adam and I used to play "pirate
cove" under these stairs.

22:24.032 --> 22:28.000
Yeah. You two had
quite the imagination.

22:28.036 --> 22:30.336
I bet you were adorable.

22:30.372 --> 22:32.738
Were? Mind if I
show her around?

22:32.774 --> 22:33.909
Sure.

22:35.977 --> 22:38.676
You know, I, um,
took out some old photos.

22:38.712 --> 22:40.081
You're absolutely gonna die.

22:47.788 --> 22:50.888
I feel so stupid.

22:50.924 --> 22:52.624
I should have
seen it, I...

22:52.660 --> 22:55.626
There was nothing to see.

22:59.601 --> 23:03.635
That is the fifth text
that you have gotten.

23:03.671 --> 23:05.440
You can look.

23:11.045 --> 23:12.377
I... I have to...

23:12.413 --> 23:14.950
You don't need to explain.

23:24.592 --> 23:26.495
Promise me you'll be
here when I get back.

23:34.869 --> 23:38.404
Lynnette Belmont's shell
company, Manning Investments,

23:38.440 --> 23:41.140
was the last recorded
owner of Flash Comics #1.

23:41.176 --> 23:43.541
She ordered the hit
on Avery's father.

23:43.577 --> 23:45.544
I've been auto-dialing Jane
and Avery's numbers,

23:45.580 --> 23:46.979
and they keep going
to voicemail.

23:47.015 --> 23:48.414
All right. Just keep
trying, all right?

23:48.450 --> 23:50.015
Tasha and I will head
to Lynnette's.

23:50.051 --> 23:51.115
Whoa, whoa, Reade!

23:51.151 --> 23:52.785
- You're with us.
- Where were you?

23:52.821 --> 23:55.019
Trying to save my marriage
before I actually have one.

23:55.055 --> 23:56.725
We'll fill you in
on the road.

24:00.661 --> 24:05.596
Oh, look. It's
Adam and you on Halloween.

24:05.632 --> 24:07.732
You were a pumpkin.

24:07.768 --> 24:10.102
- Ohh.
- I remember this.

24:10.138 --> 24:12.637
Dad dressed
as a farmer that year.

24:12.673 --> 24:15.173
You and Avery's parents
were close?

24:15.209 --> 24:18.777
Yeah. I went to school
with her mom way back,

24:18.813 --> 24:20.578
when we were in Exeter.

24:20.614 --> 24:21.914
I was in the wedding.

24:21.950 --> 24:23.749
Everyone loved Robert.

24:23.785 --> 24:27.019
I don't know who would
want to see him dead.

24:27.055 --> 24:29.158
Powerful men make enemies.

24:31.124 --> 24:32.924
Have you
looked into anyone

24:32.960 --> 24:35.560
at HCI Global
or the club?

24:35.596 --> 24:38.963
I... I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

24:38.999 --> 24:41.502
Oh, of...
yeah, of course.

24:43.904 --> 24:46.171
Here you go.
You ready to sign?

24:46.207 --> 24:49.745
Yeah. Let's get this
over with.

25:00.188 --> 25:01.487
What's the matter?

25:01.523 --> 25:03.254
My Dad had
one of these.

25:03.290 --> 25:08.192
Crawford gave it to him for
ten years of dutiful service.

25:08.228 --> 25:10.061
And then your father
gave it to me.

25:10.097 --> 25:13.898
No, he gave it to me.
It's sitting by my bed.

25:13.934 --> 25:15.032
There must have been two.

25:15.068 --> 25:16.602
Did you get this one
from Crawford?

25:16.638 --> 25:18.069
Baby, what are you
talking about?

25:18.105 --> 25:20.075
You work for him,
don't you?

25:21.808 --> 25:23.575
Did you do it?

25:23.611 --> 25:25.010
- Did you order the hit?!
- Avery!

25:26.780 --> 25:27.715
Go, go!

25:36.056 --> 25:37.189
We have to get out of here.

25:37.225 --> 25:39.828
Get to the next room.
Okay? Now!

25:44.699 --> 25:46.531
Jane!

25:47.969 --> 25:49.567
It's okay.

25:49.603 --> 25:50.805
Stay down.

25:52.707 --> 25:53.305
Uhh!

26:02.883 --> 26:04.148
Come on.
Let me show you

26:04.184 --> 26:05.853
where my secret
hiding spot it.

26:07.121 --> 26:09.291
- I know where we can hide.
- Okay.

26:23.136 --> 26:24.702
They're heading
to the panic room.

26:27.874 --> 26:29.173
No!

26:29.209 --> 26:31.108
Your arm.
You're losing blood.

26:31.144 --> 26:34.282
It's okay. I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

26:35.749 --> 26:37.182
Why aren't they leaving?

26:37.218 --> 26:39.984
Lynnette, think about this.
I'm FBI.

26:40.020 --> 26:41.185
My team's
gonna come for me

26:41.221 --> 26:42.820
if they aren't already
on their way.

26:42.856 --> 26:44.923
Get out of here. Save
yourself while you can.

26:44.959 --> 26:47.960
<i>I'm not going
anywhere till you open this door.</i>

26:47.996 --> 26:50.796
Something's not right. Why would she
risk getting caught to kill us?

26:50.832 --> 26:52.830
Unless we're not the only
thing in here that she wants.

26:52.866 --> 26:55.834
Something hidden,
something important.

26:55.870 --> 26:57.301
Like whatever's in that?

26:57.337 --> 27:00.142
We need to get word out.
My cell is downstairs.

27:01.976 --> 27:03.141
The line's dead.

27:08.650 --> 27:10.315
What's that?

27:10.351 --> 27:12.783
They're cutting
through the door.

27:12.819 --> 27:14.889
It's just a matter of time
before they get inside.

27:16.124 --> 27:17.707
Ohh!

27:19.147 --> 27:21.345
Avery. Hey, Avery.

27:21.381 --> 27:24.381
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look at me.

27:24.417 --> 27:25.883
It's gonna be okay,
I promise.

27:25.919 --> 27:27.584
I won't let anything
happen to you.

27:27.620 --> 27:29.353
I'm not worried about me.
Look at you.

27:29.389 --> 27:30.621
- You're losing blood.
- Oh, it's not that bad.

27:30.657 --> 27:32.256
It's just a graze, okay?

27:32.292 --> 27:35.925
Here, sit down.
Sit down. Okay?

27:35.961 --> 27:38.228
I've already lost
my mom and dad.

27:38.264 --> 27:39.395
I can't lose you, too.

27:39.431 --> 27:41.431
That's not how you felt
this morning.

27:41.467 --> 27:44.968
Okay. There we go.

27:45.004 --> 27:47.037
All right, listen,
I need your help, okay?

27:47.073 --> 27:48.672
Okay.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.441
I need you to
take this tourniquet,

27:51.477 --> 27:53.042
tie it two inches
above this wound,

27:53.078 --> 27:55.045
as tight as you can...
you think you can do that?

27:55.081 --> 27:56.680
- Yeah.
- Okay.

27:56.716 --> 27:59.615
Okay.

27:59.651 --> 28:02.184
- That's okay. There we go.
- Oh, did I hurt you?

28:02.220 --> 28:06.455
No, no. You did good.
You're a natural. Thank you.

28:06.491 --> 28:10.126
Now, how the hell are we
gonna get out of here?

28:12.465 --> 28:15.031
What the hell
is taking so long?

28:15.067 --> 28:16.066
It's a panic room.

28:16.102 --> 28:17.433
It's designed
to keep people out.

28:17.469 --> 28:18.468
We're making progress.

28:24.110 --> 28:25.575
I'm going to turn off
the signal jammers

28:25.611 --> 28:26.609
and negotiate with the Feds.

28:26.645 --> 28:28.077
Get inside that room.

28:36.421 --> 28:38.121
All right, Bravo Team,
split up.

28:38.157 --> 28:39.489
Want you to
surround that house.

28:39.525 --> 28:41.561
Go in the back! Go.

28:48.633 --> 28:50.467
I see you outside.

28:50.503 --> 28:52.501
I want to talk to Jane
and Avery. Now.

28:52.537 --> 28:54.437
Don't worry. She's okay.
They're both okay.

28:54.473 --> 28:57.641
And they'll stay that way if
you follow my instructions.

28:57.677 --> 28:59.308
If you hurt either of them...

28:59.344 --> 29:01.211
No, you don't make the rules,
I make the rules,

29:01.247 --> 29:03.446
because I'm the one holding
a gun to their heads,

29:03.482 --> 29:05.382
and I will shoot.

29:05.418 --> 29:06.717
Do you understand?

29:06.753 --> 29:09.720
Yes, I do.
What do you want?

29:09.756 --> 29:12.388
I want safe passage
out of my home

29:12.424 --> 29:13.522
and out of this country.

29:13.558 --> 29:15.992
Okay. I can
make that happen.

29:16.028 --> 29:17.964
But I am gonna need
some time.

29:22.501 --> 29:24.300
I assumed you told Meg.

29:24.336 --> 29:25.402
I hadn't.

29:25.438 --> 29:26.573
Why not?

29:28.440 --> 29:30.544
I kind of wanted to pretend
like it didn't happen.

29:33.179 --> 29:35.278
They're gonna
get that door off soon,

29:35.314 --> 29:36.413
and we need to be ready.

29:36.449 --> 29:37.681
To what?
Stone them to death

29:37.717 --> 29:39.016
with cans of stroganoff?

29:39.052 --> 29:40.650
We're dead, aren't we?

29:40.686 --> 29:42.019
You can't think like that.

29:42.055 --> 29:44.020
We have to focus on
what we can control.

29:44.056 --> 29:45.689
Yes, the situation sucks,

29:45.725 --> 29:47.260
but how can we use
what we have?

29:50.363 --> 29:51.394
We're almost there.

29:51.430 --> 29:52.732
They're getting closer.

29:54.066 --> 29:55.499
She can't stall them forever.

29:57.069 --> 29:58.402
Go see if you
can find another saw.

29:58.438 --> 29:59.568
We'll make this go faster.

29:59.604 --> 30:01.704
- The team must be here.
- You think?

30:01.740 --> 30:03.573
Well, who else would
she need to stall?

30:03.609 --> 30:05.709
We need to find a way
to send them a signal

30:05.745 --> 30:08.215
and tell them to advance.

30:09.782 --> 30:12.081
This vent is for
cycling air out,

30:12.117 --> 30:14.050
so it has to lead
to the outside.

30:14.086 --> 30:15.818
If we could just
send smoke through it...

30:15.854 --> 30:17.753
Sorry? A smoke signal?

30:17.789 --> 30:21.558
Yeah. A red smoke signal.

30:21.594 --> 30:22.725
How do we make red smoke?

30:22.761 --> 30:24.427
Potassium chlorate,

30:24.463 --> 30:27.033
para-nitroaniline red,
and lactose.

30:27.767 --> 30:29.331
We don't have any of that.

30:29.367 --> 30:30.834
Actually, we do.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.735
Potassium chlorate
in the bleach wipes,

30:32.771 --> 30:35.204
lactose
in the powdered milk...

30:35.240 --> 30:37.706
What about
para-nitro-whatever?

30:37.742 --> 30:39.675
It's a common dye used
in plant-based fabrics.

30:39.711 --> 30:41.110
Cotton. Perfect.

30:41.146 --> 30:42.578
Take this off.

30:42.614 --> 30:44.146
Where did you learn
all of this?

30:44.182 --> 30:46.353
Special recipe
from my K&R days.

30:47.553 --> 30:49.152
Just compromise with me.

30:49.188 --> 30:50.587
<i>At least send Avery out.</i>

30:50.623 --> 30:52.254
No one is being sent out

30:52.290 --> 30:54.558
until there is a chopper
on my back lawn.

30:54.594 --> 30:55.858
You have 20 minutes.

30:55.894 --> 30:59.162
That is not enough time.
I'm gonna need twice that.

30:59.198 --> 31:01.334
I'm working on
getting you what you want.

31:03.536 --> 31:05.501
Fine. 40.

31:07.172 --> 31:08.872
So Lynnette just gave us
some more time.

31:08.908 --> 31:10.240
Why the hell
would she do that?

31:10.276 --> 31:11.674
She's gotta know
we've called SWAT.

31:11.710 --> 31:14.644
She's not negotiating.
She's stalling us.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.113
Look!

31:16.149 --> 31:18.115
That's gotta be Jane.

31:18.151 --> 31:19.215
She's signaling us
to move in.

31:19.251 --> 31:20.683
I'm going in the front door.

31:20.719 --> 31:23.089
You guys go around the back.

31:27.426 --> 31:28.592
They're almost in.

31:28.628 --> 31:30.130
All right.

31:38.571 --> 31:40.140
Run!

31:50.850 --> 31:54.151
You've been shot.
How bad is it?

31:54.187 --> 31:56.385
- It's not great.
- Where's Avery?

32:00.293 --> 32:01.460
Don't move!

32:08.663 --> 32:10.160
You work for Crawford.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.062
Did you bring me here
to kill me...

32:12.098 --> 32:13.596
- like he killed my father?
- No.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.966
No, I just wanted
to know what you knew.

32:16.002 --> 32:19.902
That's all. And then...
and then you saw the pen and...

32:19.938 --> 32:21.805
Shut up!

32:21.841 --> 32:23.539
My father trusted you.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.040
He made you my godmother.

32:25.076 --> 32:27.943
How involved were you
in his death?

32:27.979 --> 32:29.712
I never wanted any of this.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.815
Just tell me the truth!

32:31.851 --> 32:33.249
Hank thought that your father

32:33.285 --> 32:35.085
was having
a crisis of conscience,

32:35.121 --> 32:36.519
and he was gonna
go to the authorities

32:36.555 --> 32:38.989
and he was gonna
give us all up.

32:39.025 --> 32:40.524
So he told you
to get rid of him.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.057
When he tells you
to do something,

32:42.093 --> 32:43.159
you don't say no.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.995
I mean, he had stuff
on all of us...

32:45.031 --> 32:47.029
our families.

32:47.065 --> 32:49.932
Avery, I'm so sorry.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.601
You need to pay
for what you've done.

32:51.637 --> 32:55.771
Avery.
Avery, don't do this.

32:55.807 --> 32:59.209
Your dad's gone.
You can't change that.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.081
Don't throw your life away.

33:02.614 --> 33:03.846
Mmm...

33:03.882 --> 33:05.681
Avery, you said...

33:05.717 --> 33:07.950
You said you can't lose anyone else.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.619
Well, I can't, either.

33:09.655 --> 33:10.819
Please.

33:10.855 --> 33:14.690
I can't... I can't lose you.
Not like this.

33:15.861 --> 33:18.265
Okay?

33:20.032 --> 33:21.096
Please.

33:22.301 --> 33:25.304
Okay. It's okay.
Okay.

33:30.141 --> 33:31.807
Lynnette's
changing her story,

33:31.843 --> 33:33.742
denying any connection
to Crawford.

33:33.778 --> 33:35.045
She's protecting him.

33:35.081 --> 33:36.112
Or she's afraid.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.346
Or loyal.

33:37.382 --> 33:38.781
Lynnette's stonewalling.

33:38.817 --> 33:41.851
Charon's dead.
We can't catch a break.

33:41.887 --> 33:43.687
That's not entirely true.

33:43.723 --> 33:45.889
We did get
into Lynnette's safe.

33:45.925 --> 33:47.824
There was a very pricey laptop
inside, and I'm guessing

33:47.860 --> 33:49.892
she's not using it
to play Minesweeper.

33:49.928 --> 33:52.729
It's heavily encrypted,
so I'm gonna need some time.

33:52.765 --> 33:54.064
So let's all go home
and get some rest,

33:54.100 --> 33:55.198
and by "all,"
I mean everyone...

33:55.234 --> 33:57.633
Everyone but me.
I get it.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.269
I'll get cozy
with Lynnette's laptop

33:59.305 --> 34:00.907
and see if I can
get it to talk.

34:02.108 --> 34:03.642
All right. Night.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.878
All right. Are you ready
to pull an all-nighter?

34:08.914 --> 34:11.313
Whew! Pulling all
the all-nighters on Earth

34:11.349 --> 34:12.882
isn't gonna fix this thing.

34:12.918 --> 34:14.717
- Oh, it's that bad?
- You know, whoever's

34:14.753 --> 34:16.286
feeding this data
into the web

34:16.322 --> 34:18.621
is just too good
for my algorithm.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.358
And I think you might
be working too hard.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.293
Oh, I'm definitely
working too hard.

34:23.329 --> 34:24.893
But do you want to
stick around?

34:24.929 --> 34:27.295
You know, keep me company?
We can order some Thai.

34:27.331 --> 34:31.199
We can't.
I got a date...

34:31.235 --> 34:32.969
with your mother.

34:33.005 --> 34:34.670
Really?
Dinner with the enemy?

34:34.706 --> 34:35.838
Yeah, I got to
thinking about it

34:35.873 --> 34:37.340
and realized
you might be right.

34:37.376 --> 34:40.909
My reaction might have
been, uh, unreasonable.

34:40.945 --> 34:43.315
- I apologized.
- You're a good man, Dad.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.715
You know, you could get
back on track, too...

34:46.751 --> 34:48.652
- with Tasha.
- That's not...

34:50.255 --> 34:51.286
What did she say?

34:51.322 --> 34:52.789
Nothing, kiddo.

34:52.824 --> 34:55.157
Just, I'm an engineer,
I'm a scientist.

34:55.193 --> 34:57.994
I observed some tension
and I made some inquiries.

34:58.030 --> 34:59.295
And?

34:59.331 --> 35:01.331
Well, she refused
to give details,

35:01.367 --> 35:03.199
which I thought
was very respectful.

35:03.235 --> 35:04.733
Well, yeah,
'cause the details

35:04.769 --> 35:06.903
are pretty
unflattering for her, so...

35:06.939 --> 35:08.671
She seemed very sorry.

35:08.707 --> 35:11.273
Now, this is
just a hypothesis,

35:11.309 --> 35:14.411
but is it possible you need
to take your own advice here?

35:14.447 --> 35:16.880
'Cause whatever
she did to upset you,

35:16.916 --> 35:19.682
it sounds like she was
just doing her job.

35:19.718 --> 35:22.284
Come on. Give your dad
a hug, will you...

35:22.320 --> 35:24.220
- Don't.
- What?

35:24.256 --> 35:28.124
Don't say my first name,
because everybody just

35:28.160 --> 35:30.360
calls me "Patterson"
around here.

35:30.396 --> 35:31.695
But you have
such a great name.

35:31.731 --> 35:33.829
I know you think
that's true.

35:33.865 --> 35:34.963
I love you.

35:34.999 --> 35:36.331
I love you too, sweetie.

35:36.367 --> 35:38.702
I'm so proud of you.

35:38.738 --> 35:41.438
Now, doesn't this beat
Rikers? Huh?

35:41.474 --> 35:43.840
Betcha they don't have
tempeh burritos in cellblock D.

35:43.876 --> 35:46.412
- Yeah. Because they wouldn't want to start a prison riot.
- True.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.813
Thanks for talking me down.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.916
Well, we made a pretty
great team today.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.786
Yeah. We did.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.722
I know I haven't always been
the easiest to be around.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.124
- Oh, really?
- Oh, I...

36:01.160 --> 36:02.425
I hadn't noticed that
at all.

36:02.461 --> 36:05.765
Okay. Well...

36:06.932 --> 36:08.364
Thanks for not
giving up on me.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.037
Never. We're family.

36:18.276 --> 36:21.478
So, tonight
promises to suck.

36:21.514 --> 36:24.514
Trying to crack this laptop,

36:24.550 --> 36:29.318
and I'd rather bang my head
against a wall.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.457
Do you wanna help?

36:34.193 --> 36:36.930
Yeah. I would.

36:39.932 --> 36:41.898
I'm not over it yet.

36:41.934 --> 36:43.166
I know.

36:43.202 --> 36:44.470
But I want to be.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.474
That's good enough for me.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.552
I-I thought
we were gonna talk.

37:02.588 --> 37:04.186
What's left to say?

37:04.222 --> 37:05.454
You promised
you'd stay.

37:05.490 --> 37:06.956
I promised
that I would be here

37:06.992 --> 37:08.891
when you got back.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.461
I never said
that I would stay.

37:11.497 --> 37:13.466
I'll pick up the rest
of my stuff this weekend.

37:22.907 --> 37:26.342
You don't have enough room
in your life for me,

37:26.378 --> 37:28.443
and if I'm being honest,

37:28.479 --> 37:31.918
I don't have enough room
in mine for you.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.489
Here. Take this.

37:39.525 --> 37:42.492
It's an immigration attorney
I've been speaking to.

37:42.528 --> 37:45.195
Never stop, do you?

37:45.231 --> 37:46.966
Not usually, no.

37:49.133 --> 37:51.835
I'm coming out as
undocumented in "The Times."

37:51.871 --> 37:55.103
I wrote the article
before we started dating,

37:55.139 --> 37:59.275
- but then we got serious, so I shelved it.
- Why?

37:59.311 --> 38:02.211
I wasn't gonna allow my status
to damage your career.

38:02.247 --> 38:04.981
I'm not worried about me.

38:05.017 --> 38:06.516
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

38:06.552 --> 38:09.918
Millions of people
read "The Times."

38:09.954 --> 38:11.954
I don't want to hide
in plain sight anymore.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.526
I want my readers
to know who I am.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.398
So, you'd better get
that paper on Tuesday.

38:23.202 --> 38:25.267
Wait, wait.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.939
What's gonna happen to you?

38:28.173 --> 38:31.139
I don't know.

38:31.175 --> 38:32.444
But I've gotta do this.

38:53.032 --> 38:55.063
Why are you even
dressed like that?

38:55.099 --> 38:58.166
What are you, The Ghost
of Christmas What-If?

38:58.202 --> 38:59.501
I'm a scientist,
actually.

38:59.537 --> 39:01.036
Oh, that's cute.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.405
Little Roman,
the genius,

39:02.441 --> 39:03.972
playing with
his chemistry set.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.608
Shut up.

39:05.644 --> 39:09.478
I'm a reminder of what
he could have been

39:09.514 --> 39:11.447
if you two had never
gone to that place.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.048
But we did.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.918
Why are you still holding
onto this fantasy?

39:15.954 --> 39:18.353
What, you think if you help
Crawford with this attack,

39:18.389 --> 39:21.925
you'll find some fairy-tale
ending with daddy and daughter?

39:21.961 --> 39:24.293
Live happily ever after?

39:24.329 --> 39:26.929
That doesn't
exist for us.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.932
I'm not listening
to you anymore.

39:28.968 --> 39:33.469
She's right. If you're
looking for happiness,

39:33.505 --> 39:35.240
this isn't how to achieve it.

39:36.976 --> 39:38.641
No? Then what do you suggest?

39:38.677 --> 39:41.411
Walk away. Let go.

39:41.447 --> 39:43.950
It's a little late
for that.

39:46.751 --> 39:48.487
When are you
going to tell her?

39:51.256 --> 39:52.558
Tell me what?

39:55.660 --> 39:57.427
She'll find out
soon enough.

39:57.463 --> 39:59.666
Tell me what, Roman?!

40:06.537 --> 40:09.338
Am I interrupting
something?

40:11.543 --> 40:14.510
No. I was just, um...

40:14.546 --> 40:16.682
It doesn't matter.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.284
It's been 12 hours.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.722
You got something
to show me?

40:30.796 --> 40:33.528
Oh, my God.
Can you really do this?

40:33.564 --> 40:35.635
Absolutely.

40:39.537 --> 40:41.470
If we do,
there's no going back.

40:41.506 --> 40:43.175
I wouldn't dream of it.

40:45.309 --> 40:48.010
Ugh! Even her encryption's
got encryption.

40:48.046 --> 40:51.414
Maybe you need more fuel.
What have we got here?

40:51.450 --> 40:53.349
We've got...
ooh, glass noodles.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.121
That's it!

40:57.055 --> 40:58.186
- It's glass noodles?
- I'm in.

40:58.222 --> 41:00.289
Brute force actually
worked for once.

41:00.325 --> 41:02.025
Seriously?

41:02.061 --> 41:06.429
Boom... Lynnette's documents,
downloads, emails...

41:06.465 --> 41:09.164
Wait. Look.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.534
This email was sent
to HCI Global this morning.

41:12.570 --> 41:13.702
Subject line, "Codes"?

41:13.738 --> 41:16.072
Wow. Very original,
Lynnette.

41:16.108 --> 41:17.173
Oh, my God.

41:17.209 --> 41:19.474
That's why she wanted
this laptop back,

41:19.510 --> 41:21.177
why she was willing
to risk prison.

41:21.213 --> 41:24.280
This email is full
of secret access codes.

41:24.316 --> 41:26.048
They're all in
the 60-digit format

41:26.084 --> 41:27.516
used by
Franklin-Dorfman Security.

41:27.552 --> 41:28.684
These protect
some of the most

41:28.720 --> 41:30.219
secure buildings
in Manhattan...

41:30.255 --> 41:31.487
New York Public Library,

41:31.523 --> 41:32.755
Madison Square Garden,
MoMa...

41:32.791 --> 41:34.557
All of which reset daily.

41:34.593 --> 41:35.757
Each of these codes
is only useful

41:35.793 --> 41:37.659
for the next 24 hours,
which means...

41:37.695 --> 41:38.827
Crawford's gonna
hit one or all

41:38.863 --> 41:41.063
of these buildings
tomorrow.
