00:00.285 --> 00:04.169
How about we go somewhere and talk
about anything but football?

00:04.289 --> 00:05.591
That sounds good.

00:05.753 --> 00:09.595
You're some cowboy who wanders around.
I like to think there's more in you.

00:09.757 --> 00:12.807
Sometimes, it just takes the right
woman to make it more in your heart.

00:13.616 --> 00:15.466
So look, about 30 days time.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.830
And get you a 20% profit
on your investment.

00:17.950 --> 00:20.618
It's flipping houses.
I saw it on TV, it works.

00:20.738 --> 00:22.301
- I'm in.
- You're in.

00:23.380 --> 00:26.863
Daddy bought a house today. I'm gonna
fix it up and I'm gonna sell it.

00:27.023 --> 00:30.366
And you and me, and your mommy,
can live together.

00:30.528 --> 00:33.744
We'll turn it over in about 30 days,
make a lot of money, and it'll get us...

00:34.207 --> 00:36.873
I'm moving back East,
with my parents.

00:38.758 --> 00:40.793
Freshmen, listen up!

00:41.338 --> 00:44.380
We all seniors want to thank you
for coming out of your busy schedules

00:44.542 --> 00:47.258
to meet us here tonight.
We've all been here.

00:47.418 --> 00:49.510
And you guys will look back
at what you're about to do

00:49.835 --> 00:52.017
and understand
that there's a strong purpose to it.

00:52.137 --> 00:53.931
Time has come for a Panther ritual.

00:54.334 --> 00:55.799
Drummer, please.

00:56.804 --> 00:58.113
The naked mile.

00:59.098 --> 01:01.241
- I thought it was a myth.
- What'd you say, Charles?

01:01.361 --> 01:03.475
- I said I thought it was a myth.
- I wish it was

01:03.595 --> 01:06.110
so I don't have to see your fat ass
running naked.

01:06.629 --> 01:08.208
You heard me, ladies.
Let's go!

01:08.328 --> 01:10.490
Strip down, strip down!

01:10.844 --> 01:13.780
Take your shoes off,
strip down everybody.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.195
Take it all off.

01:15.538 --> 01:18.297
- Take it all off.
- Listen up! Tell 'em Jamarcus.

01:18.417 --> 01:20.792
Look, you all know the rules.

01:21.045 --> 01:23.670
You're going to the water tower
and back.

01:24.076 --> 01:25.753
No shame, no fame, baby.

01:25.873 --> 01:28.465
McCoy, they're all running
to the water tower and back,

01:28.793 --> 01:31.511
but you, superstar,
you're running to the field house.

01:31.671 --> 01:34.624
I mean, wh...
Why do I have to run to the field house?

01:34.744 --> 01:36.455
'Cause you're the quarterback, bro.

01:36.575 --> 01:38.743
You gotta go the extra mile, dude.

01:38.885 --> 01:40.535
Get your ass over there.

01:40.889 --> 01:42.147
Go, get out of here.

01:46.315 --> 01:47.348
Go!

02:03.300 --> 02:05.065
Come on, you can do it!

02:31.983 --> 02:32.989
Come here.

02:36.208 --> 02:37.327
Where are your pants?

02:38.846 --> 02:40.205
Tonight was the...

02:40.365 --> 02:41.498
Naked mile.

02:41.882 --> 02:43.708
- Yeah.
- You fell for the naked mile.

02:45.554 --> 02:49.087
Take it to your team there and put some
clothes on, I'll give you a ride home.

02:50.265 --> 02:51.925
Please don't tell my dad, okay?

02:52.910 --> 02:54.551
Son, I wouldn't dream of it.

02:55.663 --> 02:56.471
Okay.

03:05.109 --> 03:06.697
You know, mum's got a light foot?

03:06.817 --> 03:10.318
So make sure that you howl at her
if she starts going too fast.

03:10.478 --> 03:11.947
I don't drive that fast.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.570
- Yeah, you do.
- No, I don't.

03:13.732 --> 03:17.158
Whenever I'm in the car with you, I feel
like I'm in a chase out of a Bond movie.

03:17.401 --> 03:20.572
Your daddy doesn't have any tickets.
He never got one speeding ticket.

03:20.692 --> 03:22.614
Unlike some people around here.

03:22.872 --> 03:23.872
I gotta go.

03:24.558 --> 03:27.127
I wanna get as far as possible
while he's still kind of calm.

03:27.626 --> 03:29.294
I love you, buddy, okay?

03:32.252 --> 03:34.055
Wish I knew how to stay here.

03:35.168 --> 03:37.095
That's pretty easy.
You just park the car,

03:38.369 --> 03:39.534
and stay.

03:41.688 --> 03:44.282
When you get to your parents' house,
you just tell your mom that...

03:44.402 --> 03:47.452
he gets his good looks
and perfect manners from me.

03:48.407 --> 03:50.775
While you're heading East,
I'll be fixing up this Garrity house.

03:50.935 --> 03:52.485
We're gonna turn a major profit.

03:53.324 --> 03:55.322
And have a nice cushion, so...

03:55.442 --> 03:57.846
you and Noah and I
can get a house or...

03:58.166 --> 04:00.702
just something...
Just be together.

04:02.355 --> 04:03.745
We'll see what happens, okay?

04:07.200 --> 04:08.459
Goodbye, honey.

04:20.942 --> 04:22.173
I'm scared.

04:22.886 --> 04:24.657
Don't be, don't be.

04:25.978 --> 04:27.828
- It's gonna be okay.
- Don't be scared, okay?

04:27.948 --> 04:29.666
It's gonna be great, okay?

04:30.475 --> 04:33.191
You know, your parents... You're
gonna have a great time with them.

04:34.175 --> 04:35.386
Be safe, okay?

04:39.592 --> 04:40.681
I love you.

04:42.470 --> 04:43.828
I love you both, okay?

04:46.580 --> 04:47.622
Call me.

Episode 3x06
It Ain't Easy Being J.D. McCoy

05:48.066 --> 05:51.646
- Thank you for making coffee, honey.
- You're welcome. Coming at you.

05:51.806 --> 05:55.348
I'm excited about the dance
on Saturday night.

05:55.468 --> 05:57.485
You're gonna be
my hot husband date.

05:57.645 --> 06:00.842
The principal has the obligation
of being the chaperon at the dance.

06:00.962 --> 06:03.981
And you as my husband have
an obligation of being my date.

06:04.101 --> 06:06.995
I'm not gonna be able to do that
cause I've got other things planned.

06:07.155 --> 06:09.696
No, honey, come on.
Of course, you're gonna do it.

06:09.816 --> 06:12.417
- Would you get here for a sec?
- Honey, and I need you to chaperon,

06:12.999 --> 06:14.544
and be my date most importantly.

06:14.865 --> 06:16.840
- Julie's coming.
- I'm not going.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.899
Of course, you're going.
Honey, it's your dance.

06:20.030 --> 06:22.916
- Not going.
- What do you mean? No, you're not.

06:23.036 --> 06:24.944
Y'all, come on, seriously...

06:25.673 --> 06:27.307
I would like to propose a toast.

06:28.216 --> 06:30.323
- Oh, really?
- To QB 1...

06:30.918 --> 06:32.937
of the Dillon Panthers.
Cheers, pal.

06:33.097 --> 06:34.713
Congratulations.

06:35.934 --> 06:36.816
No cheers?

06:37.331 --> 06:39.901
No, I just save the toast
for after the game.

06:40.748 --> 06:43.171
It's Westerby.
You're gonna smoke 'em.

06:43.847 --> 06:47.035
Here's an important question. Is there
any cheerleader who thinks you're cute?

06:49.226 --> 06:50.328
- Oh yeah.
- Really?

06:50.634 --> 06:54.084
There's two actually.
I have not actually proposed to them.

06:54.369 --> 06:57.794
We can talk about that now.
You can only propose one at the time.

06:57.956 --> 07:01.935
J.D. isn't getting serious about
any girls right now, he's too busy.

07:02.275 --> 07:04.719
No, honey, that was a joke.

07:05.023 --> 07:06.609
Let me tell you something.

07:06.729 --> 07:09.182
I know that you've experienced
a lot of pressure recently,

07:09.552 --> 07:11.267
but you have worked hard,

07:11.860 --> 07:13.810
and you have shown everyone
what you are made of.

07:14.463 --> 07:16.147
And for that,
I am very very proud.

07:18.293 --> 07:20.443
- Thanks, dad.
- You're very welcome.

07:20.873 --> 07:23.613
I want to give Coach Eric Taylor
a piece of my mind.

07:24.264 --> 07:28.076
You are QB1!
You won State!

07:28.320 --> 07:30.411
I did.
I did win State.

07:30.571 --> 07:33.331
He must've lost his natural mind.

07:33.733 --> 07:36.328
To think some old boy
could step into your shoes.

07:36.448 --> 07:38.086
- What's his name, again?
- McCoy.

07:38.343 --> 07:41.592
You're all on your way to school,
when you get there, all you do...

07:41.712 --> 07:43.729
you just go in,
you talk to the coach, you tell him.

07:43.849 --> 07:47.177
You've made a big mistake, all right?
It's all right, you can fix it.

07:47.669 --> 07:49.578
You wait until I deal with it.

07:49.698 --> 07:51.933
I gotta get going okay?
I'll get you during lunch.

07:52.838 --> 07:54.811
He thinks he knows football!

07:55.673 --> 07:57.251
- ... to make some money.
- OK.

07:57.371 --> 07:58.508
Timmy...

07:58.764 --> 08:01.813
Glad you could join us, today. How did
you get outta school? What's your alibi?

08:01.933 --> 08:03.401
I just told them I'm pregnant.

08:05.499 --> 08:07.907
So I just need a few days to relax.

08:08.985 --> 08:12.745
Let's get to work.
Let's start with this, here, work list.

08:13.133 --> 08:15.862
I told you miss bossy pants
had a work list.

08:15.982 --> 08:19.710
- Is there a problem with the work list?
- No you get organized, it's all good.

08:20.056 --> 08:22.003
Why do we have to do
everything upstairs?

08:23.949 --> 08:26.716
- We'll forget you just said that...
- Oh, yeah...

08:26.878 --> 08:29.971
I was thinking, maybe the first place
we could start would be the bathroom.

08:30.131 --> 08:31.639
But we need a sledgehammer to...

08:31.799 --> 08:34.475
To start working on it.
If you can pick it up, it'd be awesome.

08:37.096 --> 08:39.604
- Whatever.
- I was just asking.

08:40.746 --> 08:42.817
- What the hell is wrong with him?
- You're bossy.

08:43.270 --> 08:45.610
- I'm not bossy.
- That was abrupt.

09:07.210 --> 09:08.758
What is this song about?

09:08.920 --> 09:11.418
Really, this song is about
a lot of stuff so...

09:11.538 --> 09:14.127
- it's hard for me to explain that.
- It's really slow.

09:14.247 --> 09:16.857
It's slow for a reason.
Not all songs can be...

09:17.116 --> 09:19.020
as fast as most of our songs.
Listen...

09:19.294 --> 09:21.536
Jimmy, I hate to be
this brutally honest with you

09:21.656 --> 09:23.900
but you're really not all that good.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.818
I don't think it's all the drummer.

09:25.978 --> 09:29.322
I don't see anyone else with any
sort of... Where are you going?

09:29.482 --> 09:32.200
I am gonna leave.
I don't need this.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.287
- I will see you tomorrow, Jimmy.
- That's it, Landry. I quit.

09:36.588 --> 09:38.663
That's fun.
I could care less, Caster.

09:38.993 --> 09:40.174
You know, this sucks.

09:40.294 --> 09:42.710
I really thought we were gonna
be bigger than Crimson Thorn.

09:43.223 --> 09:46.172
Okay...
Well, Caster, for you information,

09:46.556 --> 09:48.389
I chose the name Crucifictorious,

09:48.509 --> 09:51.511
so therefore, I keep it, and also

09:51.897 --> 09:55.011
I will see you tomorrow, Jimmy
cause I know you're gonna be right back.

09:55.131 --> 09:56.849
No, you won't cause I'm out of here.

09:57.336 --> 09:58.803
What did you say?

10:00.427 --> 10:01.977
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:02.445 --> 10:06.060
So I was thinking, how about
you take off a little early tonight...

10:06.180 --> 10:07.616
and come by the pool hall.

10:07.937 --> 10:09.362
I would love to, but I can't.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.448
Really, why? You got
a date with boyfriend number two?

10:12.890 --> 10:14.307
Yeah, how d'you know?

10:14.427 --> 10:17.203
No, I've got to make decorations
for the school dance and...

10:17.363 --> 10:20.286
I have to work overtime
for this entire month.

10:20.962 --> 10:23.793
I don't know, college applications
are like 150 a piece so...

10:24.852 --> 10:26.571
I'm lucky if I get three.

10:28.421 --> 10:29.670
How about...

10:30.126 --> 10:32.260
I make things
a little easier on you?

10:32.713 --> 10:33.946
What are you doing?

10:34.066 --> 10:36.598
Just making sure my girl gets to go
to a college she wants to go to.

10:36.718 --> 10:39.600
- No, I can't, I cannot do that.
- Yes, you can. Please.

10:40.159 --> 10:41.183
Please...

10:47.733 --> 10:48.734
Do you...

10:49.200 --> 10:51.654
- Do you wanna go to this dance with me?
- No, I don't.

10:51.814 --> 10:53.193
I don't wanna go to the dance

10:53.313 --> 10:55.992
but I'd love to pick you up
from the high school dance, though.

10:56.959 --> 10:58.244
Alright.

10:58.704 --> 11:00.306
- OK.
- Alright, babe.

11:00.584 --> 11:03.638
- Gimme a call when you're out.
- Talk to you later.

11:06.487 --> 11:07.581
Big tipper?

11:08.337 --> 11:10.296
Hey, it's for my
college applications.

11:10.459 --> 11:11.798
Sure that's all it's for?

11:12.855 --> 11:16.127
All that and my, you know...
high-class sucker job.

11:16.922 --> 11:19.098
Open, open!

11:19.482 --> 11:20.558
Set blue 8!

11:21.076 --> 11:22.518
Blue 8!
Hut!

11:24.158 --> 11:25.812
There he is!
There he is!

11:25.973 --> 11:28.524
- Set your feet, J.D!
- Come on, naked gun, you're good...

11:29.540 --> 11:30.634
QB blind.

11:31.705 --> 11:33.271
Settle down into it.

11:33.662 --> 11:35.823
Settle down, man.
He's right there.

11:35.983 --> 11:38.199
- You gotta be naked next time.
- Watch these steps.

11:40.875 --> 11:42.627
Come on, naked gun.

11:44.519 --> 11:46.541
- Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

11:50.626 --> 11:51.981
Naked mile.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.690
That's a Panther tradition, Coach.

11:55.810 --> 11:59.262
Big game coming up. Team needs to be
focused. Team captain should know that.

12:01.334 --> 12:04.350
J.D. is a young quarterback. He needs
to know this team is behind him.

12:04.968 --> 12:06.728
We are, Sir.
Especially on the field.

12:07.406 --> 12:09.217
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

12:09.337 --> 12:10.450
He does, huh?

12:10.793 --> 12:12.734
You know damn well
this team respects you.

12:13.617 --> 12:15.277
You accept this kid,

12:16.293 --> 12:19.246
this team is gonna accept him.
I need that.

12:20.075 --> 12:21.625
I need you to fix it.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.466
I don't understand.
What do you mean, fix it?

12:26.635 --> 12:28.057
You're a senior...

12:28.765 --> 12:31.294
You're not gonna be wearing
the Panther uniform much longer.

12:31.928 --> 12:33.800
I want you to think about that.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.003
Think about everything it means.

12:37.108 --> 12:38.855
I'm asking for your help.

12:39.841 --> 12:42.832
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, Sir.

12:44.020 --> 12:45.020
Good.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.162
Get in!

13:05.528 --> 13:07.414
I, huh, no...
I was just gonna get on the bus.

13:08.086 --> 13:10.126
Get in the truck, 1-2.

13:21.483 --> 13:23.956
You've uh...
You've had a tour of Dillon, right?

13:26.469 --> 13:29.102
Well, not my Dillon, my friend.
Let's go.

13:33.417 --> 13:34.816
Where exactly are we going?

13:35.393 --> 13:37.779
It's on your right.
Look right.

13:38.184 --> 13:41.908
<i>You need to know this spot, OK?
It's called The Landing Strip.</i>

13:42.140 --> 13:44.915
My sister in law,
my brother's future wife...

13:45.198 --> 13:47.705
works there and probably will
for the rest of her life.

13:48.543 --> 13:50.206
You are not ready for that, son.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.085
And when you are, you will know.

13:55.233 --> 13:59.509
Up here, on our right,
we have Fran's hamburgers. 24/7.

14:00.137 --> 14:03.971
Best hamburgers, best fans
in all of high school football.

14:04.435 --> 14:08.142
The real rally girls.
And I hope you know what that means.

14:11.910 --> 14:14.816
Good times, man. I can tell
what kind of support we get.

14:15.557 --> 14:17.318
Alright, we got Smittie's dive bar.

14:17.636 --> 14:21.632
They know me as Toby,
two times Iraq veteran.

14:22.690 --> 14:26.688
If you ever wanna get away from
anything, anyone, you will go in there.

14:26.893 --> 14:28.413
You hear me? Smittie's.

14:29.018 --> 14:30.601
Best bar on the planet.

14:32.512 --> 14:34.729
- Lisa lives down this road.
- Who?

14:34.849 --> 14:38.089
You'll know, you'll know.
She's good times...

14:45.728 --> 14:47.431
This is the place, uh?

14:49.043 --> 14:50.518
Alright, man. It was fun.

14:54.998 --> 14:56.761
Coach put you up to this?

14:58.901 --> 15:00.819
- Really?
- Good night, man.

15:07.820 --> 15:11.814
Look at you, my beautiful baby!

15:12.995 --> 15:15.876
- I think this might be the one.
- You do, honey?

15:16.086 --> 15:18.379
I had no idea I would get
so emotional.

15:20.381 --> 15:21.838
You look just like an angel.

15:21.958 --> 15:25.104
Tyra! Doesn't she look
just like an angel from heaven?

15:26.197 --> 15:28.680
Mindy, I love you,
but I can see your crack.

15:30.003 --> 15:33.038
It's just a smidge.
It's just a little bit, there.

15:33.273 --> 15:36.104
- It's very tasteful, it's subtle.
- Yes, it's subtle.

15:36.510 --> 15:40.316
I could've used your support, today.
You could've left the paperwork at home.

15:40.756 --> 15:43.647
- What are you doing? What is this?
- It's my application.

15:43.767 --> 15:47.032
For the University of San Francisco?
How are you gonna hang on to that cowboy

15:47.192 --> 15:49.034
if you're out there in California?

15:49.194 --> 15:50.868
I don't wanna hang on to anybody.

15:51.417 --> 15:52.704
That's mistake #1.

15:52.865 --> 15:54.873
You know,
Cash is very supportive of me.

15:55.035 --> 15:58.623
I know. They are all so supportive.
And then try to actually do something...

15:58.743 --> 16:01.372
He gave me money
for my application fees.

16:02.283 --> 16:04.051
- He did?
- Yeah.

16:05.206 --> 16:06.843
Well, this is a very good man.

16:07.576 --> 16:10.119
They don't normally like
to take care of you just like that.

16:10.239 --> 16:11.639
You hang on to that man.

16:11.993 --> 16:15.392
I'm telling you!
And I'm speaking from experience.

16:17.326 --> 16:20.223
You know it just occurs to me, if you're
dropping a truckload on a dress,

16:20.343 --> 16:23.235
doesn't someone
give you some champagne around here?

16:23.395 --> 16:24.490
Anybody?

16:25.481 --> 16:28.014
- Don't do that.
- You're not getting a burrito.

16:28.134 --> 16:31.159
That's disgusting, dad. Do you realize
there's not even real food in it?

16:31.320 --> 16:33.280
It's all like, preservatives and...

16:33.948 --> 16:35.204
Hey, how are you doing?

16:35.415 --> 16:37.041
Well, Coach Eric Taylor.

16:37.421 --> 16:41.002
- How are you, ma'am? Good to see you.
- I'm not that good. You wanna know why?

16:41.163 --> 16:43.547
I'd be doing the heck
of a lot better

16:43.707 --> 16:45.710
if I thought you were gonna do
the right thing

16:45.830 --> 16:48.799
and make my grandson
starting quarterback like he should be.

16:48.919 --> 16:50.637
- Grandma, it's OK.
- No, hush!

16:50.987 --> 16:53.181
- Hush, he needs to hear this.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:53.609 --> 16:55.807
This boy has played
his heart out for you.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.186
I know it's difficult...

16:57.553 --> 16:59.872
We should just let 'em talk, maybe.

17:03.060 --> 17:04.195
Awkward!

17:04.810 --> 17:05.980
A little bit.

17:06.648 --> 17:09.696
Do you think we could go grab
a cup of coffee or something?

17:09.858 --> 17:13.416
We can get lunch if you want.
She'll talk about this all day.

17:15.154 --> 17:17.982
So I take it she's taking
your demotion pretty hard.

17:18.102 --> 17:19.172
Demotion?

17:19.425 --> 17:20.916
That's a little harsh.

17:22.285 --> 17:24.255
What do you want me to say?

17:25.300 --> 17:27.633
OK, I guess demotion is appropriate.

17:28.753 --> 17:31.279
- How's practice been?
- It's good.

17:31.941 --> 17:34.394
It's good.
I'm on the bench a lot now, but...

17:34.514 --> 17:36.934
I just get to talk to Landry more
cause he's always there.

17:37.906 --> 17:39.837
- Alright, you think about it.
- I will.

17:39.957 --> 17:42.507
It's hard to be mad at you,
Coach Taylor.

17:44.889 --> 17:47.839
- It's good to see you.
- You'll be thinking about what I said.

17:47.959 --> 17:50.210
- Yes, ma'am.
- Alright, bye-bye.

17:55.132 --> 17:56.577
Hey guys, good news, I got the...

18:01.774 --> 18:04.836
- Did you get the permits?
- What the hell is going on, here?

18:04.997 --> 18:07.880
I'm just improvising, man.
Just look, look. Bigger, uh?

18:10.252 --> 18:13.010
- Man, that is the Cadillac of toilets.
- Yeah, check it out.

18:13.697 --> 18:14.887
- Bidet.
- Bidet?

18:15.048 --> 18:17.618
- Right here. Bidet.
- Cleans your butt.

18:17.738 --> 18:19.017
$1,700?

18:19.642 --> 18:21.394
You spent $1,700 on a toilet?

18:21.707 --> 18:25.409
- You gotta spend money to make money.
- We're on a budget, Billy!

18:25.529 --> 18:28.985
And guess what? If we exceed that budget
we're not making any money.

18:29.286 --> 18:32.155
So you just wheel this back out
to the truck, cause that's going back.

18:32.522 --> 18:35.032
That's going back now.
And who decided to bust out this wall?

18:35.195 --> 18:36.689
Maybe it was mine.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.454
It was a load-bearing wall.

18:39.615 --> 18:41.998
I'd have been better off getting
my grandma and her bridge club

18:42.159 --> 18:43.624
to finish this house.

18:43.834 --> 18:45.960
Were you even looking
at the work list, anymore?

18:46.121 --> 18:48.255
I got your work list right here.

18:48.375 --> 18:52.341
In fact, why don't we post it on
this wall, so that nobody will miss it?

18:52.502 --> 18:53.885
Good idea, Billy. I like that.

18:54.046 --> 18:57.889
Don't talk to me like I'm a freaking
moron, I've worked construction before.

19:01.930 --> 19:03.170
Son of a bitch...

19:04.978 --> 19:07.076
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah, it hurts.

19:07.196 --> 19:09.025
Shut the hell up
and get me some pliers!

19:09.762 --> 19:11.758
No, Mindy. I can't come.

19:12.563 --> 19:16.557
Cause I gotta do these damn decorations.
I'll probably be doing them all night.

19:17.568 --> 19:19.508
Will you get me some dessert?

19:19.628 --> 19:22.790
You know, like,
chocolate fudge pie thing that I love...

19:23.913 --> 19:25.988
Thank you.
Bye, love you, sis.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.128
<i>... first game
where freshman J.D. McCoy</i>

19:28.585 --> 19:30.391
<i>will start as QB 1.</i>

19:40.034 --> 19:41.725
Hi, can I talk to Cash?

19:43.467 --> 19:44.997
Cash doesn't live here.

19:45.984 --> 19:48.064
I heard he's been
hanging around a lot.

19:48.441 --> 19:50.067
Well, you heard wrong.

19:55.414 --> 19:58.200
Seriously, he's not here.
He doesn't live here.

19:58.586 --> 20:01.536
Well, when you see him,
could you tell him that I came by?

20:02.029 --> 20:05.373
- I don't know what this is all about...
- Really? What a surprise.

20:05.881 --> 20:07.375
The pretty girl's out of a loop.

20:07.783 --> 20:10.875
When you see Cash, just tell him
that he owes Ali and Tucker

20:10.995 --> 20:14.591
$1,600 in child support, okay?

20:15.067 --> 20:16.718
Can you do that for me?

20:25.125 --> 20:26.520
<i>It's gonna do it, folks.</i>

20:26.813 --> 20:29.857
<i>With only 25 seconds left
in this contest,</i>

20:30.174 --> 20:31.859
<i>all the Panthers have to do</i>

20:32.019 --> 20:35.696
<i>is take a knee, and they
can put this one in the books.</i>

20:36.749 --> 20:38.365
Blue 8!
Hut!

20:39.084 --> 20:41.493
<i>And that's official.
This game is over.</i>

20:41.653 --> 20:43.901
<i>Young gun J.D. McCoy's debut</i>

20:44.021 --> 20:46.498
<i>in the Westerby game
unbelievable, folks.</i>

20:47.039 --> 20:49.900
<i>This kid has lit it up
like a Whitesnake concert.</i>

20:50.020 --> 20:53.922
<i>Another check in the win column for
Coach Taylor and the Dillon Panthers.</i>

21:08.695 --> 21:10.306
There you go!

21:11.171 --> 21:14.167
Big W tonight, gentlemen.
We earned it.

21:15.028 --> 21:18.087
Damn right, I'm gonna be there.
Guess who else's gonna be there tonight.

21:18.207 --> 21:20.382
- Who?
- This cab right here.

21:22.069 --> 21:23.452
1-2, great game, tonight.

21:23.943 --> 21:27.197
We're gonna go celebrate. We're gonna
create some memories, alright, 1-2?

21:28.158 --> 21:30.142
- No regrets.
- There you go, naked gun.

21:30.262 --> 21:32.960
Where is my boy? There he is.
That's what I'm talking about!

21:33.247 --> 21:35.672
That is what I'm talking about,
young man.

21:36.115 --> 21:38.675
That was one hell of a ball game.
Way to go.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.622
I'm so proud of you.

21:41.792 --> 21:44.323
Riggins, what the hell?
You were bringing the heat, boy!

21:44.443 --> 21:46.642
You were on fire!
Way to go, boy!

21:47.041 --> 21:49.277
- Excellent game!
- Yeah, he played great.

21:49.397 --> 21:52.188
Great job, guys, thank you so much.
Great game!

21:52.949 --> 21:54.149
We're gonna go celebrate

21:54.309 --> 21:57.569
with your mom, over at Applebee's.
Come on, now. We're gonna celebrate.

21:57.843 --> 21:59.529
- Come on! Here we go.
- Okay.

21:59.689 --> 22:00.718
Alright...

22:01.670 --> 22:04.660
Alright, boys, see you later.
Great game, great game.

22:06.119 --> 22:08.454
I told you, man.
Daddy got him on a leash.

22:19.597 --> 22:22.682
Good practice.
Hey, good video session.

22:25.685 --> 22:27.745
You look pretty sweet, you know?

22:28.269 --> 22:31.937
I came to see about...
just to check in with you about tonight.

22:34.483 --> 22:35.483
Tonight?

22:36.155 --> 22:38.527
The dance. The Dillon dance.

22:38.883 --> 22:40.278
You totally forgot.

22:40.717 --> 22:42.886
- The Dillon dance...
- Where is it?

22:43.299 --> 22:44.657
Come on. It's in Dillon.

22:45.682 --> 22:47.717
I just thought it'd be fun to go.

22:47.837 --> 22:50.246
You know, do one together
before it's all over.

22:50.718 --> 22:53.332
Are you gonna wear something
as cute as this, tonight?

22:53.910 --> 22:57.240
- Maybe...
- Then I'm going, with bells on.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.717
We're gonna have the time of our lives
at the dance, tonight.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.342
- I love dances.
- I do, too.

23:04.547 --> 23:06.394
Alright, this looks good.

23:07.040 --> 23:10.543
I'll take this whole palette.
I need it delivered to 213, Pinehurst

23:10.663 --> 23:11.976
by tomorrow morning or noon.

23:12.137 --> 23:14.562
- You got it.
- OK. Thank you. I appreciate it.

23:14.723 --> 23:17.648
- Jason, how are you doing?
- Good, Coach. How are you doing?

23:18.163 --> 23:20.526
- How are you?
- Doing well. What brings you down here?

23:20.869 --> 23:23.625
I got a honey-do list.
I see you got one, too.

23:23.745 --> 23:24.864
No, not quite.

23:25.298 --> 23:28.722
The Riggins brothers and I have bought
Buddy Garrity's house, and so we're...

23:28.842 --> 23:31.162
fixing it up, so I had to come
and pick a bunch of stuff up.

23:31.514 --> 23:32.748
You what?

23:32.908 --> 23:35.594
Riggins brothers and I have bought
the Garrity's house to flip it.

23:35.714 --> 23:37.982
- Tim and Billy?
- Yeah, and Herc.

23:38.102 --> 23:40.678
We all got together,
and put the money in.

23:40.848 --> 23:43.219
We got a good deal on the house.
And we're flipping it.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.385
- Buddy Garrity's house?
- Yeah.

23:45.678 --> 23:48.847
You know, we're upgrading it,
making it a lot more upscale

23:49.057 --> 23:52.322
and we gonna sell it. I know it sounds
crazy with the market nowadays...

23:52.442 --> 23:55.353
We got a good team, working 24 hours
a day. We gonna make this thing happen.

23:55.610 --> 23:57.469
And... I'm excited.

23:57.765 --> 23:59.815
Haven't had any snags
or anything, so...

24:00.026 --> 24:01.943
That's great.
That's great.

24:02.234 --> 24:03.486
I gotta get going.

24:04.260 --> 24:06.788
It's good to see you. You'd stop
by the house, check it out.

24:06.908 --> 24:10.060
- I'll do that. I'm sure it is.
- It's looking real nice.

24:10.411 --> 24:11.577
Alright, Coach.

24:11.917 --> 24:15.290
You just put it right here.
I'll just take the whole thing.

24:15.902 --> 24:18.917
I am a stupid, stupid girl.

24:20.409 --> 24:21.974
You are not a stupid girl.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.966
He's a stupid guy for thinking he can
get away with something like that.

24:26.464 --> 24:28.719
You know what the worst part is?
I liked him.

24:30.688 --> 24:32.681
I even think
I was falling in love with him.

24:33.149 --> 24:36.103
Maybe there is some sort of
random explanation

24:36.524 --> 24:38.897
and it's not really
as bad as it seems.

24:39.313 --> 24:41.437
Julie, a woman came to my house

24:41.722 --> 24:44.701
telling me that my boyfriend
owes her child support.

24:45.205 --> 24:46.570
How much worse could that get?

24:47.940 --> 24:49.406
She could be his sister.

24:51.509 --> 24:53.859
I mean, theoretically,
that'd be a lot worse.

24:54.345 --> 24:56.301
Something Landry would say.

24:59.258 --> 25:01.545
Tyra, 3 o'clock.
Turn around.

25:02.786 --> 25:04.380
- How's my lady?
- Don't touch me.

25:05.980 --> 25:08.642
You need to leave now.
You need to leave, right now.

25:08.762 --> 25:10.611
Slow down, hold on.
What's going on?

25:10.731 --> 25:12.268
Just calm down...

25:12.388 --> 25:14.390
What am I talking about?
How about some woman

25:14.551 --> 25:16.852
comes to my house with a baby
that she says is yours.

25:17.062 --> 25:18.270
My house!

25:18.480 --> 25:21.140
- Tyra, look...
- No, you know what? Don't touch me.

25:21.260 --> 25:23.364
I want you to leave, right now.

25:24.066 --> 25:27.200
- You're not gonna let me explain.
- No. You know, here...

25:27.542 --> 25:29.864
Why don't you give this to her,
for child support, OK?

25:31.200 --> 25:32.200
Go!

25:40.630 --> 25:41.847
This is good!

25:42.160 --> 25:44.444
You got everything
that you need for...

25:44.614 --> 25:47.981
- Yeah, it's good.
- It's good? It's gonna be fun, man.

25:48.101 --> 25:50.634
Thanks for coming back and everything.
I appreciate it.

25:50.996 --> 25:52.678
Alright, man. Let's do this!

25:52.839 --> 25:55.348
Just follow him and me,

25:55.742 --> 25:57.772
just relax, and...

25:58.496 --> 26:00.144
Let's see what you got!
Alright, ready?

26:10.186 --> 26:13.073
Thank you for coming. It's just not...
It didn't feel right.

26:32.304 --> 26:34.346
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah, man.

26:38.845 --> 26:41.089
Hi, guys. My name is Devin.

26:41.209 --> 26:44.633
I'm in freshman course
right now, and...

26:44.753 --> 26:47.844
I really just wanna expand more,
like, music-wise.

26:47.964 --> 26:50.481
So I decided I'd come
and audition today.

26:50.601 --> 26:53.783
Well, we appreciate
you coming up, Devin.

26:54.454 --> 26:56.116
So, I'm just gonna
plug in real quick.

26:56.543 --> 26:59.578
Alright, let's just give it a shot
and see what happens...

28:00.338 --> 28:01.633
That was...

28:02.932 --> 28:05.327
- That was pretty fun.
- good.

28:05.998 --> 28:07.609
I mean she's in, right?

28:09.006 --> 28:12.060
- I think so. That was good.
- I think so.

28:12.418 --> 28:14.452
I think you're in, congratulations.

28:14.572 --> 28:16.865
I think we're all set on vocals,
pretty much.

28:17.380 --> 28:18.741
But we'll see what happens.

28:19.083 --> 28:22.153
I'd like to be in this band, so...
That'd be great.

28:22.952 --> 28:24.039
Great!

28:34.788 --> 28:35.926
Hey, Coach!

28:37.628 --> 28:38.862
Come on in.

28:39.355 --> 28:41.805
It's work in progress,
as you can see.

28:42.100 --> 28:44.191
Yeah, I can see it is.

28:44.415 --> 28:45.809
We progressed so far, as to

28:45.970 --> 28:48.354
take a perfectly livable house
and turn it into a place

28:48.516 --> 28:52.107
that if a bum saw, would say, "Thanks,
I'll go back to sleep under the bridge."

28:52.523 --> 28:54.878
So, we're, you know...
getting there.

28:55.915 --> 28:57.614
My dad used to say,

28:57.734 --> 29:00.033
"It always looks bad
before it gets better."

29:01.225 --> 29:03.774
I don't think
it's gonna get better, Coach.

29:04.019 --> 29:06.289
I think I've made
the biggest mistake in my life.

29:06.701 --> 29:09.834
The mother of my child and my son are
in a car on their way up to New Jersey.

29:09.995 --> 29:13.462
I decided that the smartest thing to do
would be to buy a house and flip it

29:13.582 --> 29:15.214
with the Riggins brothers and Herc.

29:15.806 --> 29:17.966
Cause I didn't know what else to do.
I love them so much,

29:18.128 --> 29:19.898
I just don't wanna be
a debt beat dad,

29:20.018 --> 29:23.526
I just wanna be able to provide a
little bit, some security, something...

29:24.064 --> 29:25.625
anything for them and...

29:26.262 --> 29:29.222
Slow down. Slow down a second.
Wait a second.

29:30.111 --> 29:33.857
First of all, you're not gonna be a debt
beat dad. You need to calm down, here.

29:34.350 --> 29:36.173
Look, you're 20 years old.

29:36.725 --> 29:39.641
You're not supposed to know what you'll
do with the rest of your life, yet.

29:39.761 --> 29:42.599
You're doing what you think is best.
You're following through it.

29:42.719 --> 29:44.326
That's what you should be doing.

29:44.488 --> 29:47.288
You had a plan, you're executing it.
What's wrong with that?

29:47.408 --> 29:49.411
But you gotta give it a chance,
give yourself time.

29:49.531 --> 29:52.251
You can't beat yourself up
cause you're taking chances on things.

29:52.412 --> 29:55.305
But don't start giving up on what
you set forward to do in the beginning

29:55.425 --> 29:57.715
cause that's gonna get you nowhere.
I promise you that.

30:13.362 --> 30:14.857
I borrowed Landry's car.

30:15.985 --> 30:18.812
And you drove it over here...

30:22.406 --> 30:24.256
Do you wanna go to the lake?

30:39.589 --> 30:41.913
Have you ever been
fired from anything?

30:43.245 --> 30:47.012
One time, when I was 12 years old,
I babysat for the Griffins

30:47.529 --> 30:49.687
and I never got asked back.

30:53.373 --> 30:56.868
- You still carry that with you, huh?
- I still carry that until this day.

30:56.988 --> 30:59.445
That's rough.
I don't know, I mean...

31:00.593 --> 31:03.072
I never thought I was gonna play
professional football...

31:03.981 --> 31:07.451
but I kinda thought it might help pay
for college or something, and now...

31:08.065 --> 31:10.037
I'm a senior
and I'm sitting on the bench.

31:10.984 --> 31:13.268
Bottom line, it just...
sucks.

31:13.999 --> 31:15.202
Yeah, it does.

31:16.180 --> 31:19.346
But you know what's kinda cool?
It's the first Saturday I can remember

31:19.466 --> 31:23.050
waking up and not having to think about
everything I did wrong the night before.

31:23.546 --> 31:27.020
- Well, see, that's a good thing.
- Yeah, that's a good thing.

31:27.941 --> 31:31.643
- So, do you feel prepared?
- Prepared for what?

31:31.962 --> 31:34.979
Prepared to get
your but whipped by a girl.

31:37.212 --> 31:38.674
That was rude.

31:40.688 --> 31:41.986
I'm gonna get you!

31:49.004 --> 31:50.072
Good job.

31:52.512 --> 31:53.512
Hey, honey!

31:55.710 --> 31:58.961
What is it about rice crispy treats
that they're just so darn good?

32:02.167 --> 32:03.898
Let me tell you something.

32:04.406 --> 32:06.390
You've been doing a great job.

32:06.510 --> 32:08.885
- It's quite an achievement.
- Honey...

32:09.216 --> 32:10.351
I'm serious.

32:11.209 --> 32:12.612
I'm proud of you.

32:13.373 --> 32:14.643
Thank you.

32:15.651 --> 32:17.729
Of course I'm thinking
my husband is in the process

32:17.891 --> 32:20.850
of blowing me off which is not
making me very happy.

32:20.970 --> 32:22.484
These men! It's typical, right?

32:23.074 --> 32:26.114
Well, I don't know. In his case,
he usually has something else come up

32:26.274 --> 32:29.367
- but I thought he'd be here tonight.
- I broke up with Cash.

32:31.763 --> 32:34.373
- Sorry, honey.
- No you're not.

32:34.916 --> 32:36.149
Yeah, I am.

32:37.113 --> 32:39.627
What I didn't want to happen
was for you to get hurt.

32:42.162 --> 32:43.162
Well...

32:43.669 --> 32:45.516
I always have this, right?

32:47.095 --> 32:48.755
I'm just gonna go home.

32:49.047 --> 32:51.158
Alright, now just keep in mind
as you're reading these

32:51.278 --> 32:53.904
that these are all
works in progress.

32:54.209 --> 32:57.102
Very rough...
Some of them aren't even complete.

32:58.731 --> 33:01.549
I know what a work
in progress means, so...

33:01.910 --> 33:02.984
I'll just read it.

33:04.268 --> 33:07.779
- Do you dance, or anything?
- I took ballet when I was little.

33:09.208 --> 33:10.838
Me too! That's...

33:13.256 --> 33:16.164
- I was joking.
- I thought you were joking.

33:17.816 --> 33:21.085
Can I say something about these songs,
just one musician to another?

33:21.830 --> 33:22.837
Of course.

33:22.998 --> 33:26.765
Well, they all kinda feel like
they're one song about one girl.

33:26.885 --> 33:29.878
I mean, if you think about it,
that's basically the majority

33:29.998 --> 33:32.721
of all rock music is about: a girl.

33:33.094 --> 33:36.099
But I just...
I think our band could be really great.

33:37.301 --> 33:39.019
- So do I.
- I just kinda think

33:39.181 --> 33:42.105
that you need
to get over this girl, then.

33:44.991 --> 33:46.069
Is she here?

33:50.563 --> 33:52.737
Nope, she's not.

34:04.977 --> 34:06.380
Footloose, here we come.

34:06.947 --> 34:08.754
I love this kind of style.

34:08.873 --> 34:10.716
- Yeah?
- It just feels right, you know?

34:10.969 --> 34:11.969
Stop it.

34:13.549 --> 34:15.722
There he is.
You look good, tonight.

34:16.231 --> 34:18.199
- What are you doing here?
- My mom...

34:18.319 --> 34:20.310
- thought it'd be good to have some fun.
- Did she?

34:21.072 --> 34:22.397
And, are you having fun?

34:23.126 --> 34:24.188
Not really.

34:24.351 --> 34:26.190
- You know Lyla.
- Hi, J.D.

34:26.402 --> 34:27.819
How is it going?

34:27.978 --> 34:29.822
You gonna cut a rug, or what?

34:34.415 --> 34:37.495
- Tell me you don't wanna go get a beer.
- I don't wanna go and get a beer.

34:37.656 --> 34:39.496
No, I'm serious.
Let's go somewhere fun.

34:39.658 --> 34:41.319
- It is fun.
- No, it's not fun.

34:41.438 --> 34:44.210
You know what type of people have fun
at these dances? The type of people that

34:44.330 --> 34:48.045
when they grow up, they'll look back
and have regrets. We don't want to.

34:48.165 --> 34:49.507
Right, right?

34:49.911 --> 34:52.092
- So you're gonna come for a beer.
- I don't drink.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.475
- What do you mean?
- There you go, he doesn't drink.

34:54.594 --> 34:57.701
My dad gave me an article,
it disrupts protein and senses...

34:57.821 --> 34:59.434
- What does?
- Alcohol.

34:59.791 --> 35:02.139
Fine, who doesn't need a driver?
We're gonna get wasted.

35:02.259 --> 35:04.104
I can't drive.
I don't have a license.

35:04.224 --> 35:06.274
I can't drive.
I only have a learner's permit.

35:06.434 --> 35:08.692
- He doesn't have a license.
- You're coming anyways.

35:08.985 --> 35:11.498
Let's go. Hey, just believe me,
trust me on this one.

35:11.618 --> 35:14.823
Just this one time, we're going.
I got... We're gonna have some memories.

35:15.260 --> 35:16.950
- All right? Come on.
- Pants-off.

35:20.885 --> 35:23.129
Alright, no regrets, let's do this.

35:29.870 --> 35:31.087
Safety first.

35:32.194 --> 35:34.342
Let me know when you and your date
need a ride home.

35:35.057 --> 35:36.404
Is she mad at me?

35:36.524 --> 35:37.804
Yes, McCoy.

35:38.164 --> 35:39.934
- Let's just have some fun.
- Okay.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.387
Memories, tonight.

35:44.076 --> 35:45.191
Nice tie!

35:47.493 --> 35:49.160
Tyra, it's me. Open up.

35:51.646 --> 35:53.279
Tyra, I know you're home.
Open up.

35:53.689 --> 35:54.822
Go to hell, Cash!

35:57.170 --> 35:59.210
Tyra, please,
just let me talk to you.

35:59.330 --> 36:01.928
How about you go talk to your girlfriend
or your wife or whoever?

36:02.048 --> 36:03.706
She's not my girlfriend or my wife!

36:04.127 --> 36:05.875
If you let me explain,
you'd know that.

36:06.370 --> 36:07.376
Please.

36:08.112 --> 36:09.294
Tyra, come on.

36:16.137 --> 36:18.012
What part of "Go to hell"
don't you understand?

36:18.404 --> 36:20.622
- Just hear me out, please.
- Why?

36:20.742 --> 36:23.360
Because I think
I deserve at least that much.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.936
As far as I'm concerned,
you don't deserve anything right now.

36:26.522 --> 36:28.874
Well, I'm sure
you don't think I do.

36:29.659 --> 36:33.820
The girl that came here, her name
is Ally Darcy. And that's not my baby.

36:34.545 --> 36:35.940
I did hook up with her.

36:36.060 --> 36:38.241
One time, five years ago.

36:38.649 --> 36:41.013
And it's not gonna
happen again, because...

36:41.133 --> 36:42.453
you met her, she's crazy!

36:43.251 --> 36:45.344
I shouldn't say that,
but she is crazy.

36:45.464 --> 36:48.595
After we hooked up, she started
showing up at my work, making a scene,

36:48.715 --> 36:50.154
so, I just left town.

36:50.632 --> 36:54.262
I was in Wyoming doing
the rodeo circuit, and now, I'm back.

36:54.382 --> 36:57.033
And who comes knocking on my door
a couple months ago?

36:57.153 --> 36:59.177
Ally Darcy, with a two-year old.

36:59.757 --> 37:02.932
I hooked up with her five years ago.
There's no way that kid is mine.

37:03.448 --> 37:05.892
And if it was, I wouldn't be
lying to you, telling you it wasn't,

37:06.402 --> 37:07.918
cause I'd step up.

37:09.312 --> 37:12.733
I'm telling you the truth. I have
no reason to be dishonest with you.

37:17.302 --> 37:18.305
That's it?

37:18.425 --> 37:20.449
Yes, that's it.
That's all of it.

37:21.226 --> 37:23.042
She made me feel so awful.

37:23.730 --> 37:26.225
I'm sure she did,
I'm sorry about that.

37:29.279 --> 37:31.627
- You're not lying to me?
- No, I'm not lying to you.

37:32.808 --> 37:34.493
I would never lie to you.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.699
I'm sorry.
Do you forgive me?

37:47.851 --> 37:48.853
Maybe.

37:58.983 --> 38:02.240
- How many girlfriends do you have?
- Just the one, McCoy.

38:04.186 --> 38:05.619
God, she's so pretty!

38:06.152 --> 38:07.830
Yes, she's pretty special, man.

38:08.426 --> 38:10.753
Alright, you're on your own
for a bit.

38:10.873 --> 38:11.958
No, wait!

38:12.468 --> 38:13.836
What am I supposed to do?

38:15.223 --> 38:18.048
If you get in trouble,
Act like you're looking for someone.

38:18.438 --> 38:19.528
Secondly,

38:19.986 --> 38:20.986
relax!

38:21.131 --> 38:22.802
Have some fun, laugh!

38:23.483 --> 38:26.473
There's a lot of pretty girls.
Have some fun, alright?

38:28.491 --> 38:30.436
I'm gonna steal her for a minute,
if that's cool?

38:30.687 --> 38:32.996
She doesn't have the choice, sorry.

38:37.703 --> 38:39.362
There he is, naked gun!

38:40.153 --> 38:42.907
Ladies and gentlemen,
J.D. McCoy cutest buns in Dillon.

38:43.068 --> 38:45.286
Are you getting ready
to run another midnight run?

38:45.406 --> 38:48.161
No, no, I did my work-out
early this morning.

38:48.373 --> 38:50.387
J.D., man,
help yourself, bro.

38:50.943 --> 38:52.357
- Y'all didn't know?
- What?

38:52.495 --> 38:53.918
This guy's body is a temple.

38:54.586 --> 38:57.170
He doesn't drink sodas,
doesn't eat candy,

38:57.332 --> 38:59.089
definitely can't drink beer.

38:59.250 --> 39:01.258
Your dad runs
a tight little ship, doesn't he?

39:01.849 --> 39:03.927
Have a drink, man!
This is a party.

39:05.753 --> 39:09.183
- A beer sounds pretty good right now.
- Move around, baby.

39:11.171 --> 39:12.540
To J.D. McCoy!

39:40.122 --> 39:41.460
Well, look at that!

39:42.568 --> 39:44.002
Come on, let's go.

39:50.031 --> 39:53.457
You're like the prettiest girl
I've ever seen in my life.

39:53.822 --> 39:56.500
You and Riggins are gonna make
some cute babies.

39:56.620 --> 39:58.108
You're like the coolest, man.

39:58.426 --> 40:00.718
You're like the last American dude.

40:01.371 --> 40:03.560
He doesn't listen to my dad,

40:03.680 --> 40:06.645
he doesn't listen to your dad,
you don't listen anybody's dad.

40:06.765 --> 40:08.666
That's pretty... quite odd, man!

40:17.039 --> 40:19.461
I thought you were Mr. Stackhouse.

40:19.581 --> 40:21.171
What are you doing here?

40:21.332 --> 40:23.955
Do you know how late it is?
Where have you been?

40:24.075 --> 40:25.696
I've been getting dressed,
shaving...

40:25.816 --> 40:29.137
Don't just come in here
and try to slow down smalls with me.

40:29.299 --> 40:32.230
- Why do have paint in your hair?
- I don't have... Don't worry why.

40:32.350 --> 40:34.905
No, I do worry.
You know, you stood me up.

40:35.025 --> 40:37.198
- I could fire you.
- No, you can't fire me.

40:37.318 --> 40:40.856
You can't fire me, you'd have to go
through the board supervisor, boosters,

40:40.976 --> 40:43.040
This, that, and everything else...

40:43.383 --> 40:46.363
- It'd be a lot of trouble, wouldn't it?
- How was your day?

40:46.680 --> 40:50.424
How was my day? I've been sitting here
at this dance with no date.

40:51.035 --> 40:52.080
He's here.

40:56.968 --> 40:59.634
Veggie hot dogs are amazing!

41:00.738 --> 41:02.753
No.
I'm just gonna stick to...

41:02.923 --> 41:05.174
You know,
good old fashioned, all American...

41:06.556 --> 41:07.568
hot dog!

41:08.390 --> 41:10.583
Do you realize what you're eating?
It's like...

41:10.703 --> 41:13.584
cow eyes,
and like a pig intestines.

41:14.218 --> 41:16.566
And you know what?
That tastes good.

41:17.812 --> 41:19.016
Real good.

41:20.230 --> 41:22.141
I think food is better outside.

41:22.596 --> 41:24.318
I would have to agree with that.

41:25.166 --> 41:28.317
But I'm really stuffed,
then we should probably get going.

41:29.523 --> 41:30.533
Well...

41:31.002 --> 41:32.450
we probably should.

43:19.602 --> 43:21.685
That is the cutest baby
I've ever seen.

43:24.379 --> 43:26.557
- She's adorable.
- She is such a stylish...

43:26.677 --> 43:29.420
Excuse us for a second,
we'll be right back.

43:30.635 --> 43:32.058
Coach?
Hey, how you doin'?

43:32.178 --> 43:34.201
- Hey, how are you?
- Good, good.

43:35.412 --> 43:39.203
Listen, J.D. has got something
he needs to share with you.

43:40.583 --> 43:42.733
I got... really drunk, last night.

43:43.410 --> 43:46.001
I had a lot of alcohol,
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

43:46.162 --> 43:47.670
A lot of alcohol?

43:48.317 --> 43:50.214
He came home... drunk.

43:50.424 --> 43:52.173
Not so much of one sip of wine

43:52.335 --> 43:55.718
his entire life. 3 weeks before
the playoffs, he comes home...

43:55.930 --> 43:58.764
drunk. Now, he knows
that he has disappointed his father,

43:59.261 --> 44:02.993
he has let down his coach, his team,
and I felt that it was imperative

44:03.113 --> 44:05.312
that he'd come to you
and apologize personally.

44:06.298 --> 44:08.648
- I hope you understand.
- Understood.

44:09.019 --> 44:10.984
Anything else he's done
that I should be aware of?

44:16.115 --> 44:17.553
No, he works hard.

44:17.889 --> 44:20.661
Good, we got to keep our star
in a straighten arrow.

44:20.822 --> 44:22.472
- Thank you so much.
- Excuse me, all.

44:22.592 --> 44:24.447
- Don't mean to interrupt.
- Not at all.

44:24.567 --> 44:27.918
Seemed a little more serious for church
but she had to see her daddy.

44:28.079 --> 44:30.747
She said,
"I need my daddy immediately."

44:31.499 --> 44:33.965
Thank you, Coach. We'll talk soon.
Nice to see you.

44:34.127 --> 44:36.634
- Okay y'all, happy Sunday.
- All right, bye.

44:37.312 --> 44:39.471
- Take care, now.
- Okay, bye bye.

44:40.975 --> 44:43.808
- I told you to say that.
- We gotta go get that stove later.

44:44.609 --> 44:48.378
So, I guess when you finish with that,
we'll go ahead and...

44:48.891 --> 44:50.467
- Soon.
- Who's that?

44:50.587 --> 44:52.860
Hey, Erin.
Did you guys make it there yet?

44:53.692 --> 44:56.021
No, we still got another day to go.

44:56.190 --> 44:58.073
I just pulled over
to give him a little break.

44:58.717 --> 45:01.702
I don't even know where we are
right now. Some park, somewhere.

45:03.066 --> 45:04.496
I miss you guys, like crazy.

45:05.277 --> 45:09.272
Well, we love you too,
we miss you too.

45:10.412 --> 45:11.753
Put the little man on.

45:12.234 --> 45:14.882
<i>- Am I really that boring to talk to?
- No.</i>

45:15.092 --> 45:17.717
I just don't want my son
to forget my voice.

45:18.545 --> 45:20.650
He won't... forget your voice.

45:21.195 --> 45:22.277
Here he is.

45:23.583 --> 45:26.457
<i>- Come on. It's your daddy.
- Hey Noah, hey my man.</i>

45:26.829 --> 45:28.603
<i>It's your daddy.
Hey, I miss you.</i>

45:29.296 --> 45:31.774
Well, I love you.
I love you very much.

45:31.984 --> 45:33.859
<i>And I wish I'd be there
with you, but...</i>

45:34.208 --> 45:36.611
I thought maybe
we could sing together, though,

45:37.046 --> 45:38.396
<i>in my duet</i>

45:38.516 --> 45:41.575
<i>So, I'm gonna start singing,
you just join whenever you want, okay?</i>

45:42.091 --> 45:45.953
<i>There's a hole in my bucket,
dear Liza,</i>

45:46.569 --> 45:47.872
dear Liza.

45:48.398 --> 45:51.000
<i>There's a hole in my bucket,</i>

45:51.290 --> 45:54.128
<i>dear Liza, there's a hole.</i>

45:54.505 --> 45:55.714
<i>Now, it's your turn.</i>

45:56.484 --> 45:59.756
You don't wanna  do the girl part today?
Okay, I'll do it.

46:00.486 --> 46:03.000
<i>Then fix it, dear Henry,</i>

46:03.120 --> 46:05.306
<i>dear henry, dear Henry.</i>

46:05.786 --> 46:08.768
<i>Then fix it, dear Henry,</i>

46:08.930 --> 46:10.638
dear Henry, fix it.

46:12.990 --> 46:15.691
I love you, buddy.
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

47:02.840 --> 47:04.650
- Tami, what did you do?
- Why?

47:04.910 --> 47:07.990
Because if I don't have my fullback
on Friday night, I'm screwed.

47:08.160 --> 47:11.169
Therefore, I'm telling you,
I should've been part of that process.

47:13.658 --> 47:16.703
Every time a decision is to be made,
you wave that baby around like a gun.

47:16.873 --> 47:20.958
Erin is up in New England with my kid.
Her parents are putting him in daycare

47:21.218 --> 47:23.676
which I can't afford.
How am I supposed to compete with that?

47:23.846 --> 47:25.106
You're leaving?
