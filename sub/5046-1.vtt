00:35.108 --> 00:36.112
I am the police.

00:36.112 --> 00:37.675
And I'm here to arrest you.

00:37.716 --> 00:39.964
You've broken the law.

00:40.002 --> 00:41.568
I did not write the  law.

00:41.608 --> 00:43.854
I may even disagree with the law.

00:43.895 --> 00:44.978
But I will enforce it.

00:45.018 --> 00:48.991
No matter how you plead, cajole, beg or attempt to stir my sympathies...

00:48.991 --> 00:53.123
...nothing you do will stop me from placing  you in a steel cage with grey bars.

00:54.206 --> 00:56.093
If you run away, I will chase you.

00:56.133 --> 00:58.219
If you fight me, I will fight back.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.748
If you shoot at me, I will shoot back.

01:01.189 --> 01:04.038
By law, I am unable to walk away.

01:04.077 --> 01:05.562
I'm a consequence.

01:05.602 --> 01:07.087
I am the unpaid bill.

01:07.127 --> 01:08.732
I am fate with a badge and a gun.

01:09.374 --> 01:12.343
Behind my badge is a heart like yours.

01:12.383 --> 01:14.148
I bleed.

01:14.188 --> 01:15.192
I think.

01:15.231 --> 01:16.635
I love.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.842
And yes I can be killed.

01:20.447 --> 01:26.025
And although I am but one man...  ...I have thousands of brothers and sisters who are the same as me.

01:26.066 --> 01:28.393
They will lay down their lives for me.

01:28.432 --> 01:30.077
And I them.

01:30.118 --> 01:32.325
We stand watch together.

01:32.365 --> 01:34.290
A thin blue line.

01:34.332 --> 01:36.497
Protecting the prey from the predators.

01:36.537 --> 01:38.263
The good from the bad.

01:38.303 --> 01:41.151
We are the police.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.652
Thirteen X-ray nine is in pursuit of a Code  vehicle west on two seven.

01:47.692 --> 01:49.056
Go ahead, motherfucker.

01:49.096 --> 01:50.741
Try to run, you son of a bitch.

01:52.467 --> 01:53.270
Hold on, hold on!

01:53.310 --> 01:56.559
Eastbound through the alley at twenty hundred block from Hooper.

01:56.559 --> 01:59.288
Now eastbound through the alley at twenty hundred block from Hooper.

01:59.288 --> 02:00.291
Oh shit!

02:00.411 --> 02:02.056
Come around, come around!

02:02.097 --> 02:03.781
Move!

02:03.822 --> 02:04.383
Get the fuck around!

02:06.149 --> 02:07.073
Pull to the right!

02:07.112 --> 02:08.276
Pull to the right!

02:08.276 --> 02:09.961
He's not going to pull to the right.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.090
You stupid motherfucker!

02:14.495 --> 02:15.779
He almost lost it!

02:18.507 --> 02:19.069
Pit him!

02:19.150 --> 02:19.751
Pit him!

02:21.155 --> 02:21.837
Got him!

02:29.461 --> 02:29.983
Fuck you!

02:39.492 --> 02:40.094
You good?

02:40.133 --> 02:40.936
Good.

02:42.381 --> 02:43.183
This fucker's down.

02:43.224 --> 02:44.267
I'm going to hook him.

02:52.130 --> 02:52.692
You're all good.

02:53.375 --> 02:55.501
Thirteen x-ray nine, you can show a Code Four.

02:55.541 --> 02:59.673
Thirteen x nine is requesting additional supervisors to the four thousand block at Naomi.

03:00.918 --> 03:01.720
Walk it off.

03:02.202 --> 03:03.165
You good?

03:03.165 --> 03:03.526
I'm good.

03:03.566 --> 03:05.171
Holy shit.

03:05.171 --> 03:05.974
Yeah, motherfucker.

03:07.618 --> 03:08.302
All right.

03:08.302 --> 03:09.544
This is my day job.

03:09.544 --> 03:12.153
Some of you... Sorry, bro, I'm recording.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.076
This is my day job.

03:13.116 --> 03:14.721
Some of you might know me as Brian.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.366
Or Taylor.

03:16.406 --> 03:20.217
But here I am Police Officer Two Brian Taylor.

03:20.257 --> 03:25.193
This is where the forces of good......prepare to fight to forces of evil.

03:25.232 --> 03:27.881
This is my partner, Officer Zavala.

03:27.881 --> 03:28.644
I'm in my chones.

03:28.644 --> 03:29.125
I know, come on.

03:29.125 --> 03:29.887
- No no, I'm in my chones.

03:31.091 --> 03:33.981
We work basic patrol here at Newton.

03:34.021 --> 03:35.625
One of the toughest divisions in the LAPD.

03:35.625 --> 03:37.310
Shootin' Newton, that's right.

03:37.791 --> 03:38.955
Lucky Thirteen.

03:38.995 --> 03:41.082
This is a department issue sidearm.

03:41.082 --> 03:42.126
Glock nineteen.

03:42.165 --> 03:44.051
Spyderco tactical knife.

03:45.375 --> 03:46.660
This little thing can break windows.

03:49.709 --> 03:51.194
Two Smith and Wesson handcuffs.

03:52.036 --> 03:53.801
Can of OC spray.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.084
Pepper spray.

03:55.125 --> 03:56.410
Two extra mags.

03:56.450 --> 03:58.014
What else?

03:58.055 --> 03:58.415
That's my nametag.

03:58.415 --> 04:01.104
You can see my partner's dirty locker.

04:01.104 --> 04:02.468
Yours is like a woman.

04:02.468 --> 04:03.030
Look at this.

04:03.069 --> 04:04.313
What is this, Pottery Barn?

04:04.313 --> 04:06.600
Are you going to shut the fuck up and get ready for roll call?

04:06.640 --> 04:08.367
Don't swear.

04:08.367 --> 04:10.212
I have to edit that out, when you swear.

04:10.252 --> 04:10.974
Oh fuck.

04:11.014 --> 04:12.098
Oh shit.

04:12.138 --> 04:13.181
Fuck.

04:16.712 --> 04:18.798
You kids having fun?

04:18.839 --> 04:20.322
Look, it's Officer Van Houser.

04:20.322 --> 04:21.567
Officer Three.

04:21.608 --> 04:22.609
Van Houser.

04:22.651 --> 04:25.218
Considered unpromotable by the department.

04:25.258 --> 04:28.067
And the angriest fucking cop in the world.

04:28.107 --> 04:29.592
I'm going to tell Sarge that you're taping in here.

04:29.952 --> 04:30.916
What'd you say?

04:30.956 --> 04:33.483
I'm going to tell Sarge that you're taping in here.

04:33.483 --> 04:37.095
It's not really called taping anymore.

04:37.095 --> 04:40.746
It uses flash cards, but it's not really a-... - Don't worry about it.

04:40.786 --> 04:41.187
- God damn it!

04:41.228 --> 04:41.830
Like that?

04:41.869 --> 04:45.280
Turn it on.

04:45.882 --> 04:47.166
Am I recording you?

04:47.206 --> 04:48.891
Yes, and I'm recording you.

04:48.931 --> 04:50.657
That's so cool.

04:50.696 --> 04:51.620
That thing there?

04:51.659 --> 04:53.345
That's the lens right there.

04:53.385 --> 04:55.472
Just like this right here.

04:55.511 --> 04:56.875
Hey guys, quiet down.

04:56.916 --> 05:00.206
All right, let's settle down.

05:00.246 --> 05:00.848
Let's settle down.

05:00.888 --> 05:01.971
Captain's here, he'd like to say a few words.

05:01.971 --> 05:02.975
Let's quiet down.

05:02.653 --> 05:03.457
Thank you, Sergeant.

05:03.496 --> 05:04.098
Good afternoon.

05:04.139 --> 05:05.261
Good afternoon.

05:05.302 --> 05:06.505
- Put it down.

05:06.505 --> 05:07.749
I'd like to welcome back Zavala and Taylor.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.318
D.A.cleared these guys in last month's shooting.

05:10.318 --> 05:11.521
Turned out to be a good shooting.

05:11.521 --> 05:14.049
I know firsthand what you guys went through.

05:14.088 --> 05:16.096
It's a unpleasant experience being under that much scrutiny.

05:17.379 --> 05:18.543
But you need to remember something.

05:18.543 --> 05:21.030
An on the job shooting is still considered a homicide.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.358
It's never an easy ride.

05:23.358 --> 05:26.688
If you do the right thing, I will always have your back.

05:26.727 --> 05:31.463
Do the wrong thing and cross me, I will personally throw you under the bus.

05:31.503 --> 05:32.947
Am I clear?

05:32.505 --> 05:33.670
Yes sir!

05:33.710 --> 05:34.232
Taylor, am I clear?

05:34.232 --> 05:34.592
- Yes sir.

05:34.512 --> 05:35.916
Sergeant, am I clear?

05:35.957 --> 05:36.397
- Yes sir.

05:36.438 --> 05:37.481
Have a nice day.

05:37.481 --> 05:39.166
Thank you, Captain.

05:43.780 --> 05:44.664
Quiet down!

05:44.704 --> 05:46.389
See this?

05:46.429 --> 05:47.473
It's a ticket book.

05:47.512 --> 05:49.680
Inside are things called tickets.

05:49.719 --> 05:50.722
Son of a bitch.

05:50.762 --> 05:55.657
You can do things like stop motorists and cut citations for speeding or going through a light.

05:55.697 --> 05:56.379
You all need to write.

05:56.339 --> 05:57.744
Sarge, we cut citations every watch.

05:57.744 --> 05:59.910
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to these two idiots.

05:59.950 --> 06:01.355
My partner has a question.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.642
I don't really know how to write.

06:04.645 --> 06:07.654
But I do sign and draw pictures.

06:07.695 --> 06:11.145
Seriously, you don't start writing, Captain's going to shit on my head...

06:11.105 --> 06:13.071
and in turn, I'm gonna shit on yours.

06:13.071 --> 06:15.599
And I promise you, you guys are going to be separated.

06:15.599 --> 06:16.401
Do it, Sarge.

06:16.401 --> 06:18.408
Orozco and Davis, X Twenty-five.

06:18.326 --> 06:20.575
Peterson and Washington, X Forty One.

06:20.575 --> 06:23.263
Zavala and Taylor, you got X Thirteen.

06:23.302 --> 06:25.549
Williams and Cho, X Eight.

06:25.590 --> 06:27.355
Alameda and Green, X Twenty-one.

06:27.394 --> 06:29.442
Van Houser and Sook, X Four.

06:29.481 --> 06:30.244
Yeah, Sarge?

06:30.283 --> 06:31.649
That's not our area.

06:31.688 --> 06:32.451
That's not your area?

06:32.451 --> 06:33.333
No, we work Nine.

06:33.333 --> 06:34.056
I'm sorry.

06:34.216 --> 06:34.738
Oh no, you're right.

06:34.778 --> 06:36.704
You're on X Thirteen.

06:36.745 --> 06:38.670
Sorry fellas, this isn't Monopoly.

06:38.710 --> 06:39.953
You don't get to choose your real estate.

06:40.115 --> 06:40.635
Now go.

06:40.635 --> 06:41.077
Get out.

06:41.117 --> 06:45.972
Zavala, try not to kill anybody before the end of the watch.

06:46.013 --> 06:46.694
Really, Sarge?

06:46.735 --> 06:49.905
Sir, if we kill someone in X Thirteen, can we go back to X Nine?

06:50.867 --> 06:52.312
Today is a brand new day.

06:52.352 --> 06:55.121
Get the shop, gas the shop, wash the shop.

06:55.361 --> 06:57.688
Make sure day watch didn't leave behind any surprises for us.

06:57.728 --> 06:58.771
Look for guns, drugs, puke.

06:58.771 --> 06:59.775
Pay attention, Boot.

06:59.775 --> 07:00.177
Goodbye.

07:00.177 --> 07:01.260
Hurry up- Yes sir.

07:01.260 --> 07:02.063
How you doing, Van Houser?

07:02.222 --> 07:03.547
I warned you about that shit.

07:03.587 --> 07:05.151
Where you running with that piece, Boot?

07:05.151 --> 07:06.035
What?

07:06.074 --> 07:06.636
Why you so scared?

07:06.676 --> 07:07.560
Go, go!

07:07.599 --> 07:08.924
Jesus Christ!

07:08.963 --> 07:09.805
- Go on, shit.

07:09.847 --> 07:10.409
It's like it's day one.

07:10.409 --> 07:12.012
Boot, slow down with that piece.

07:12.053 --> 07:12.776
Slow down!

07:12.815 --> 07:13.538
Orozco, have you been working out?

07:13.698 --> 07:14.339
Yeah, with your mom.

07:14.381 --> 07:16.426
Why are you shooting everything?

07:16.426 --> 07:17.750
It's for his class.

07:17.790 --> 07:19.396
I thought you were studying law.

07:19.435 --> 07:20.439
Pre-law.

07:20.479 --> 07:21.402
I need an art elective.

07:21.442 --> 07:22.244
I'm taking filmmaking.

07:22.285 --> 07:23.930
Well, get my good side.

07:23.930 --> 07:25.415
You don't have a good side.

07:26.498 --> 07:29.106
Listen, you know they can subpoena that shit if something goes sideways, right?

07:29.106 --> 07:30.671
Think twice.

07:30.590 --> 07:31.192
Two words.

07:31.233 --> 07:32.556
Erase button.

07:32.597 --> 07:36.770
Two words: Just because you guys think you're these big ghetto gunfighters now, don't mean you can be dropping your calls.

07:36.810 --> 07:38.735
That was at least two dozen words.

07:38.776 --> 07:42.105
Well, I barely got a G.E.D. so what do you expect, white boy?

07:43.430 --> 07:45.356
Saddle up, ladies, we're sick of holding up your end.

07:45.517 --> 07:46.600
Admit it, you'd hit that shit.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.242
Orozco.

07:47.924 --> 07:48.406
Yeah.

07:48.406 --> 07:49.609
With a cinderblock.

07:49.609 --> 07:51.334
Check the roof, Boot.

07:51.374 --> 07:52.940
Where's your shop?

07:53.060 --> 07:55.186
I got Red Bull, Monster, and-

07:55.186 --> 07:56.550
They all say thirteen, check the roof.

07:56.590 --> 07:58.035
Thank you, ma'am.

07:58.075 --> 08:00.202
Faster, Boot, let's go - Get in the car!

08:00.242 --> 08:00.442
- Yes sir!

08:00.483 --> 08:01.967
And then I got you some kombucha because I know you like that stuff.

08:02.008 --> 08:02.649
Fuck that shit!

08:02.690 --> 08:04.294
What is that?

08:30.495 --> 08:31.378
$1,000,000,000,000 to pay for a failed  year drug war how many millions are in a trillionprop  54% voted to imprison the other 46

08:49.875 --> 08:51.160
It's good to be back, man.

08:52.443 --> 08:55.332
Old lady was driving me crazy at the casa, like making me do shit.

08:56.054 --> 08:56.776
Oh no!

08:56.816 --> 08:58.703
She dared ask for your help around the house.

08:58.742 --> 08:59.986
That's incredible.

09:00.026 --> 09:01.190
Outrageous.

09:01.230 --> 09:05.122
Just because I look like the dudes from Home Depot, doesn't mean I do the shit the dudes from Home Depot do.

09:04.680 --> 09:08.011
I would never profile you as a man who helps his wife with chores.

09:08.051 --> 09:08.251
Shut up.

09:08.291 --> 09:08.974
Dude, I'm your homie.

09:09.014 --> 09:10.900
I would never do that.

09:11.863 --> 09:16.156
Her brother was always coming over during the day to swim.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.641
Every day.

09:17.681 --> 09:19.286
I hate everything about him.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.890
He smells like weed sometimes.

09:21.574 --> 09:22.657
Like he's got a prescription.

09:23.298 --> 09:26.307
The guy was like ‘no, it's all good' and I was like whatever, get him the hell out of here.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.555
I swear to God I'm filling in that pool with cement.

09:28.555 --> 09:31.243

It is all about your attitude.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.182
All right.

10:15.861 --> 10:17.225
- I'm not playing with you all.

10:17.265 --> 10:20.073
Sir, if you've been drinking, you need to stay the fuck inside and not intimidate the mailman.

10:20.113 --> 10:20.596
That's it.

10:20.596 --> 10:21.197
Fuck you!

10:21.197 --> 10:22.400
You need to shut the fuck up!

10:29.582 --> 10:29.863

10:54.499 --> 10:57.268
I don't know who the fuck you think you're fucking with, but I love this shit.

10:57.628 --> 10:59.796
To beat a motherfucking punk-ass police ass like yours.

12:50.297 --> 12:51.540
You almost ran the light, stupid.

You better not bust out wasting my motherfucking time, I'm gonna tell you that shit right now.

12:59.606 --> 13:02.053
La La, when are you going to fuck the homeboy?

13:02.776 --> 13:04.621
I am not fucking the homeboy, dog.

13:04.661 --> 13:06.587

Slow down, this is the street.

13:16.217 --> 13:16.698
This is it.

13:16.738 --> 13:17.220

13:17.260 --> 13:19.346
Wicked, you're going to jump and get the party started, got it?

13:19.387 --> 13:19.869

13:21.915 --> 13:23.279
All right, put your fucking face on, let's go!

13:23.279 --> 13:24.001
Get your shit ready.

13:24.041 --> 13:25.566
Put that fucking shit away!

13:25.606 --> 13:27.611
Your fucking shit is good to go.

13:27.653 --> 13:29.097
What the fuck do I have to fucking tell you?

13:29.137 --> 13:30.100
I don't want to fucking have to baby you!

13:31.384 --> 13:32.387

13:35.878 --> 13:36.760
All right.

13:38.365 --> 13:40.250
But on some real shit, though,  I wanted to holler at you.

13:40.250 --> 13:44.224
All my niggers keep on talking about how you got your ass whipped by a motherfucking little punk-ass wonton.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.468
No, these niggers is hating.

13:45.468 --> 13:46.791
Let me tell you something.

13:46.832 --> 13:48.437
Me and the cop got  down, right?

13:48.437 --> 13:52.007
Motherfucker took off his badge, dropped his  gun.

13:52.007 --> 13:53.291
I mean, he kept it gangster.

13:53.291 --> 13:54.576
We straight up squabbled.

13:54.616 --> 13:55.218
Head up.

13:55.618 --> 13:57.343
But they still took you to the County though?

13:57.343 --> 13:58.868
Yeah, but for disorderly conduct.

13:58.868 --> 14:01.116
Not for squabbling with the police, you feel me?

14:01.116 --> 14:03.804
You fought a cop and they didn't put no assaulting a peace officer on you?

14:03.323 --> 14:04.808
Listen to me, my nigga.

14:04.848 --> 14:05.489
I'm trying to tell you all.

14:05.489 --> 14:07.575
They really showed me love to keep it G.

14:07.575 --> 14:08.980
I'm a two time felon, right?

14:09.020 --> 14:09.782
Y'all know that, right?

14:09.782 --> 14:12.471
Could have struck me out and gave me life for fighting that cop, you feel me?

14:12.471 --> 14:14.156
I got right out, it wasn't shit.

14:14.036 --> 14:15.680
All right, but we heard you got your ass beat.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.487
You better shut the fuck up, CK.

14:17.527 --> 14:19.732
I'll run this fucking fork up in your ass, I swear to god.

14:19.732 --> 14:21.218
Let me tell you something...

14:21.257 --> 14:23.705
win, lose or draw...

14:23.746 --> 14:27.597
...as long as you squabble and get down, that's gangster, you understand what I'm saying?

14:27.597 --> 14:28.039
Yup.

14:28.039 --> 14:30.687
I mean, that Mexican cop might be acting bull with you, Tre...

14:30.887 --> 14:32.773
But he's still out there out there killing niggers.

14:32.813 --> 14:33.456
Straight out.

14:33.456 --> 14:34.378
No no no.

14:34.418 --> 14:35.783
Listen to me, all y'all.

14:35.783 --> 14:38.431
This whole fucking thing is like changing of the guard.

14:38.470 --> 14:42.483
Back in the day, all these neighborhoods used to be black, and what are they now?

14:42.483 --> 14:43.566
Mexicans.

14:43.566 --> 14:44.288
Exactly.

14:44.330 --> 14:48.141
There used to be chicken stands on the corner, and now there's fucking taco stands on every corner.

14:48.141 --> 14:52.113
We're in some real shit and if we don't come together, we're going to be some extinct niggers pretty soon.

14:52.153 --> 14:53.356
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

14:53.798 --> 14:54.802
Go go go!

15:17.552 --> 15:18.314

15:31.033 --> 15:32.678
And that's what I'm fucking telling you.

15:32.759 --> 15:33.240
Good.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.005
That was fucking good.

15:35.086 --> 15:36.249
That's what I'm fucking telling you.

15:36.249 --> 15:38.136
I'm proud of you.

15:38.175 --> 15:39.138
Fucking did it.

15:39.218 --> 15:41.827
That's what I'm fucking talking about when I'm fucking proud of you.

15:41.867 --> 15:44.435
Fucking proud of you man now you're a fucking man.

15:44.435 --> 15:45.277
Right?

15:45.277 --> 15:46.121
Right, homie.

15:46.121 --> 15:46.560
- Right?

15:46.560 --> 15:47.242
Right.

15:47.242 --> 15:47.645
- All right then.

15:47.645 --> 15:49.530
No fucking fear.

15:49.530 --> 15:50.814
No fucking fear.

15:50.814 --> 15:52.338
That's how we fucking do it.

15:52.338 --> 15:54.506
That's how we fucking do it.

15:55.709 --> 15:57.275
Call the motherfucking ambulance!

15:57.314 --> 15:58.438
They got CK!

15:58.438 --> 16:00.483
Somebody call a fucking ambulance!

16:01.487 --> 16:03.574
Bitch ass sewer rats was from Curbside.

16:03.613 --> 16:04.617
I seen them.

16:05.059 --> 16:05.619
Fucking Ese's are serving us.

16:05.619 --> 16:06.743
Curbside's serving us.

16:06.743 --> 16:08.749
Curbside's banging all over us on Bloods.

16:08.550 --> 16:09.713
You got that chopper?

16:09.713 --> 16:11.559
Let's go hit these little punk ass fools.

16:11.559 --> 16:12.401
Cut that fucking camera off!

16:23.916 --> 16:27.648
So this is what we believe to be the Code thirty-seven vehicle used in the drive-by last night.

16:27.648 --> 16:28.772
Curbside Gang's at it again.

16:28.811 --> 16:29.855
It fits the description.

16:29.894 --> 16:30.818
It comes back as stolen.

16:30.858 --> 16:35.311
Curbside likes these vehicles because they blend in, you can put a lot of people in them.

16:35.351 --> 16:38.841
This door slides back, and the gang members open fire.

16:38.883 --> 16:43.697
The victim was a male black from a Blood set that has basically been at war with this Hispanic gang over control of narcotic sales.

16:43.255 --> 16:43.898
Partner.

16:43.937 --> 16:44.701
Yeah.

16:44.741 --> 16:45.784
What's up?

16:45.824 --> 16:46.346
- Check this out.

16:46.386 --> 16:47.148
Oh shit.

16:47.148 --> 16:49.395
Those are shell casings.

16:49.435 --> 16:54.932
Detectives told us that three different weapons were used and we're seeing at least two kinds of shells, so... Shit.

16:55.333 --> 16:55.935
What's up?

16:56.978 --> 16:59.065
Those are the Homicide Detectives working the case.

17:00.188 --> 17:00.990
The hell's this?

17:01.030 --> 17:01.633
What?

17:01.633 --> 17:02.515
Candid Camera?

17:02.515 --> 17:04.201
No sir, it's just a project I'm working on.

17:04.201 --> 17:04.642
Yeah?

17:04.642 --> 17:05.164
Yeah.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.006
I don't want to see that.

17:06.006 --> 17:09.457
There are forty-five and nine millimeter shell casings inside.

17:09.497 --> 17:10.380
How do you know that?

17:10.420 --> 17:11.824
Did you touch them?

17:11.824 --> 17:12.465
No sir.

17:12.506 --> 17:13.790
Did you fuck up my vehicle?

17:13.830 --> 17:14.433
No sir.

17:14.472 --> 17:16.558
- Sir, we found it, we called you.

17:16.598 --> 17:21.132
The big dogs are here now, so set up some yellow tape and stand on the other side of it.

17:23.019 --> 17:27.031
It's been two hours, we're still waiting for the detectives to release the scene so we can go back on patrol.

17:26.469 --> 17:27.553
Comfortable footwear.

17:27.593 --> 17:29.840
Policing is all about comfortable footwear.

17:37.825 --> 17:39.148
Officer Van Houser.

17:39.189 --> 17:40.674
Good evening.

17:40.714 --> 17:44.646
Sarge said I should relieve you guys so you can go back to being the street gods that you are.

17:44.686 --> 17:45.648
I'm down with that.

17:49.099 --> 17:49.621
On the street.

17:50.864 --> 17:52.027
Watch the street.

17:52.389 --> 17:54.476
Make sure no assholes come up here and kill us.

17:54.596 --> 17:55.118
Yes sir.

17:57.164 --> 17:58.167
Fucking Christ.

17:58.207 --> 18:01.417
Officer Van Houser, have you made a difference today?

18:04.788 --> 18:07.557
You know I see you guys out here, you're being good little company men, aren't you?

18:07.596 --> 18:08.880
Are you doing the Lord's work?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.846
And you're making a difference, as you call it.

18:10.886 --> 18:15.018
It's all fun and games to you, you get to run and jump and fight and shoot.

18:15.018 --> 18:21.479
One day the LAPD is going to bend you over your black and white... and they are going to fuck you up the ass.

18:22.361 --> 18:30.186
They are going to fuck you so long and so hard... you're going to want to eat your gun just to make it stop.

18:30.106 --> 18:38.050
And if you don't eat your gun and the fucking somehow magically stops...they're going to give you freeway therapy.

18:38.091 --> 18:40.939
You're going to end up doing West End Valley daywatch.

18:40.980 --> 18:47.319
Spending two hours every day on the fucking freeway... just thinking about the fucking that they gave you.

18:49.044 --> 18:50.408
Bad guys attack from up front.

18:50.689 --> 18:51.653
The department comes in from the rear.

18:53.177 --> 18:53.859
Watch your six.

18:54.942 --> 18:55.745
I'm ready.

18:56.989 --> 18:59.276
This may say Purell but It's really K-Y.

19:01.001 --> 19:01.843
Officer Zavala.

19:02.687 --> 19:03.328
That's funny.

19:03.368 --> 19:05.375
You kids have fun out there.

19:05.375 --> 19:07.943
The LAPD's got a big fucking cock.

19:07.943 --> 19:09.226
You've got a big heart.

19:10.189 --> 19:11.233
Thank you for sharing that.

19:12.115 --> 19:13.358
Can't wait to get it up the ass.

19:19.780 --> 19:21.383
Are you going to hook up with a Mexican girl?

19:21.987 --> 19:23.350
Quit trying to hook me up with one of them.

19:23.390 --> 19:25.116
It'd be great if you did but--

19:25.116 --> 19:25.918
I get it, man.

19:25.959 --> 19:26.559
Shit.

19:29.570 --> 19:30.693
Sweet brown sugar.

19:32.459 --> 19:33.862
You should marry one of my cousins.

19:33.902 --> 19:36.912
If they're anything like you I wouldn't be able to stand a fucking hour with them.

19:38.958 --> 19:40.483
Waking up in the morning, they'd be like...

19:40.483 --> 19:41.365
"Hey, can I tell you a story?"

19:41.365 --> 19:42.449
I know.

19:42.449 --> 19:45.659
‘Here's a story about this and a story about that and a story about this and a story about that –

19:45.659 --> 19:48.989
But all you gotta do is this...

19:50.393 --> 19:51.798
‘You want to come to my cousin's quinceanera?

19:51.798 --> 19:53.042
‘My daughter's quinceanera?

19:53.202 --> 19:54.205
My brother's quinceanera?

19:54.446 --> 19:54.807
Yeah.

19:54.807 --> 19:56.171
My sister's quinceanera?

19:56.211 --> 19:58.298
There's always something happening, though, bro.

19:58.338 --> 20:01.869
It's better than like ‘Hey, do you know the new kind of flavored coffee I have?

20:01.908 --> 20:03.714
‘Do you like this kind of coffee?

20:02.912 --> 20:03.514
Oh really?

20:03.514 --> 20:04.717
Shut the fuck up.

20:04.758 --> 20:05.921
The baristas are excellent.

20:05.921 --> 20:07.808
You like fucking coffee, don't give me that shit.

20:07.808 --> 20:09.052
I like fucking good Starbucks coffee.

20:08.810 --> 20:09.412
Whatever.

20:09.412 --> 20:10.295
I'll let you lay into me.

20:10.335 --> 20:10.817
Lay into me.

20:10.856 --> 20:12.100
Fine.

20:13.586 --> 20:14.789
Thirteen x-ray thirteen.

20:14.829 --> 20:15.832
Missing juvenile.

20:15.872 --> 20:17.356
Two seven one seven Jefferson.

20:17.356 --> 20:20.486
Code Incident five seven five five and thirteen twenty-seven.

20:21.931 --> 20:24.097
Thirteen x-ray thirteen, we're going to be Code Six on the missing juvenile.

20:25.823 --> 20:26.505
I can't see dick.

20:29.073 --> 20:29.635
Hi.

20:31.842 --> 20:33.928
We got a call about some missing children.

20:33.967 --> 20:35.533
Yes, my babies are gone.

20:36.496 --> 20:37.218
All right.

20:37.259 --> 20:38.060
My babies are gone.

20:38.060 --> 20:38.743
You want to let us in?

20:38.743 --> 20:39.103
We can talk.

20:39.103 --> 20:39.827
We can have that conversation.

20:40.468 --> 20:41.030
OK.

20:41.070 --> 20:42.756
My babies are gone.

20:42.795 --> 20:43.919
They've been missing all night.

20:43.959 --> 20:44.801
And I've been here.

20:44.841 --> 20:46.005
Why don't you just step over here for a second, ok?

20:46.045 --> 20:47.530
Officer, we're wasting time.

20:47.530 --> 20:48.292
Let me see your hands.

20:48.292 --> 20:49.496
How many children are missing?

20:49.737 --> 20:50.419
Two.

20:50.459 --> 20:52.666
A boy and a girl.

20:52.706 --> 20:54.511
What are the ages of the children that are missing?

20:54.511 --> 20:55.033
One is...

20:55.033 --> 20:57.280
one and the other be three.

20:57.280 --> 20:57.882
Sir!

20:57.921 --> 20:58.965
Somebody took them.

20:59.006 --> 20:59.969
Let me see your hands, please.

20:59.969 --> 21:00.971
Maybe it was when I went to the bathroom.

21:01.012 --> 21:01.614
Let me see your hands.

21:01.614 --> 21:02.215
Someone quick quick quick.

21:02.215 --> 21:02.616
OK ma'm

21:02.616 --> 21:03.218
In and out

21:03.218 --> 21:03.579
- All right.

21:03.579 --> 21:03.901
Ok.

21:03.901 --> 21:04.342
All right.

21:04.381 --> 21:04.623
All right.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.188
Hands behind your head.

21:06.188 --> 21:07.551
I've been here all night.

21:07.592 --> 21:08.636
Officer, we're good here.

21:08.675 --> 21:10.561
Don't say anything to them.

21:10.601 --> 21:11.926
I know, but they're not here.

21:11.926 --> 21:12.567
They're gone.

21:12.567 --> 21:13.129
The babies are gone.

21:13.170 --> 21:13.931
What did you say?

21:13.972 --> 21:15.095
I'm going to check the house, ok?

21:15.095 --> 21:15.978
Listen to me, officer.

21:16.018 --> 21:17.342
I'm trying to tell you.

21:17.342 --> 21:18.064
I've looked-

21:18.064 --> 21:18.465
The kids are with their grandma.

21:17.824 --> 21:18.666
Is this your husband?

21:18.666 --> 21:20.271
No, that's not my husband.

21:18.666 --> 21:21.114
Sit the fuck down!Sit the fuck down!

21:21.234 --> 21:22.117
I've been looking.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.040
I understand.

21:23.040 --> 21:23.641
I'm going to check the house.

21:23.641 --> 21:26.210
Sometimes children can hide under a bed or in a closet.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.975
You can talk to my partner.

21:27.975 --> 21:29.099
You're wasting time!

21:27.975 --> 21:29.017
The kids are at grandma's!

21:29.057 --> 21:30.181
The kids are not here!

21:30.222 --> 21:32.790
If you can please go outside and get my kids.

21:32.830 --> 21:33.753
Talk to my partner.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.157
Stop, don't push me!

21:35.277 --> 21:36.601
My babies are missing!

21:36.601 --> 21:37.524
Let me see some type of warrant.

21:37.524 --> 21:38.207
You got a warrant?

21:38.247 --> 21:39.451
Let me see some type of warrant.

21:39.451 --> 21:40.774
We don't need a warrant, she let us in.

21:40.815 --> 21:41.978
Why the fuck did you say anything?

21:42.018 --> 21:44.024
You stupid – why the fuck did you say anything?

21:44.065 --> 21:45.469
Sit down-

21:45.509 --> 21:47.314
I was going to get a cigarette.

21:47.314 --> 21:47.957
Not right now.

21:47.997 --> 21:49.842
I'm trying to tell you, the kids are with their grandma, ok?

21:51.166 --> 21:51.608
I heard you.

21:51.648 --> 21:52.330
They're with the grandma.

21:55.620 --> 21:57.064
Would you please listen to me, Officer?

21:57.105 --> 21:58.229
Let me see some type of warrant.

22:00.796 --> 22:01.960
You shut the fuck up!

22:02.000 --> 22:03.444
Why the hell did you let them in here?

22:03.485 --> 22:04.487
Press charges on this motherfucker!

22:04.487 --> 22:05.852
You fucking bitch, I'm going to kill you!

22:05.892 --> 22:08.139
I'm going to kill you, motherfucker!

22:08.179 --> 22:08.981
Get the fuck off me!

22:09.944 --> 22:10.828
What the fuck's happening?

22:10.867 --> 22:11.590
Wait a minute!

22:11.590 --> 22:12.192
- All right, all right!

22:12.231 --> 22:13.475
Did you head what I said to you?

22:13.515 --> 22:13.957
Did you hear what I said to you?

22:13.996 --> 22:16.004
You just let me know how clear I have to make myself to you.

22:16.244 --> 22:19.373
Why don't you open your fucking mouth and tell me how clear I have to make myself to you.

22:19.413 --> 22:19.735
Partner!

22:19.774 --> 22:20.096
Partner!

22:20.136 --> 22:21.219
Get off him.

22:22.663 --> 22:23.385
Brian, what's up?

22:23.385 --> 22:24.750
You ok, partner?

22:25.432 --> 22:26.154
What's happening, Brian?

22:26.194 --> 22:28.001
Fuck you, you dumb-ass smoker bitch!

22:28.001 --> 22:29.564
I'm going to kick you in the fucking face!

22:29.605 --> 22:30.087
I found the kids.

22:30.126 --> 22:31.692
Fucking crackhead.

22:38.753 --> 22:39.916
It's ok, it's ok.

22:39.957 --> 22:40.558
You're ok now.

22:43.327 --> 22:47.260
I'm just gonna – oh shit.

22:49.426 --> 22:49.948
It's ok.

22:49.988 --> 22:51.031
It's ok, sweetie.

22:51.071 --> 22:51.473
All right.

22:53.439 --> 22:54.402
Hey buddy, stay still.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.655
All right, you're ok now.

22:58.976 --> 22:59.939
You're ok.

23:04.312 --> 23:04.994
Come here, come here.

23:04.994 --> 23:05.636
You ok?

23:05.636 --> 23:06.399
You gonna take care of your sister?

23:22.007 --> 23:23.010
Fucking kids.

23:50.173 --> 23:50.936
It's so funny.

23:52.260 --> 23:53.744
It's so funny to text.

23:53.744 --> 23:54.346
Who are you texting?

23:54.346 --> 23:54.868
That same bitch?

23:55.309 --> 23:56.153
Dude, yeah.

23:56.193 --> 23:56.794
She's smart.

23:57.155 --> 23:59.282
She's like the first girl I can have a conversation with.

23:59.843 --> 24:02.532
You know she has a Master of Science in Fluid Hydraulics.

24:02.572 --> 24:04.497
Fluid Hydraulics?

24:04.538 --> 24:05.059
Yes.

24:05.983 --> 24:07.427
I wouldn't brag about that.

24:07.467 --> 24:10.517
That she has a master's degree in Fluid Hydraulics.

24:10.557 --> 24:11.359
I date all these girls, man.

24:11.359 --> 24:12.282
They're smoking hot.

24:12.282 --> 24:13.968
Your little fucking badge bunnies

24:13.968 --> 24:15.411
I get laid without a badge, thank you very much.

24:15.251 --> 24:16.535
Because you were in the Marines.

24:16.575 --> 24:18.782
Don't ask don't tell.

24:18.822 --> 24:19.544
There's a pattern.

24:19.584 --> 24:20.949
An M.O. here.

24:20.988 --> 24:23.236
First date is dinner and a respectful kiss.

24:24.198 --> 24:26.967
Second date is dinner, full carnal knowledge.

24:27.208 --> 24:31.943
And then third date is dinner and uncomfortable silences when I try to discuss anything of merit.

24:32.906 --> 24:35.273
Then it's two or three booty calls and it's on to the next.

24:36.316 --> 24:40.850
Ok, I went to prom and I got married a week later.

24:40.850 --> 24:43.979
And I ain't tapped anybody but Old Faithful for like eight years.

24:43.979 --> 24:46.668
So I don't know what you're tripping about.

24:46.427 --> 24:47.310
Ok.

24:47.310 --> 24:48.192
Wait, look at me real quick.

24:48.192 --> 24:48.875
aha

24:48.875 --> 24:49.917
Ok, ready?

24:49.917 --> 24:50.319
Yeah.

24:50.359 --> 24:52.004
I want somebody to talk to.

24:52.045 --> 24:53.047
Not just sleep with.

24:53.088 --> 24:55.013
Do you fucking understand what I'm saying?

24:55.054 --> 24:56.017
Oh.

24:56.017 --> 24:57.461
Yeah.

24:57.502 --> 24:58.546
Jesus, dude.

24:59.387 --> 25:02.196
White people get hung up on this fucking soul mate bullshit.

25:02.236 --> 25:05.687
Just hook up with a chick that can cook and wants kids.

25:05.726 --> 25:08.174
Some bitch that's down for you, that won't fuck your friends, and you're straight.

25:08.335 --> 25:13.631
You're the smartest motherfucker I know, you're not going to find some chick that's as smart as you.

25:16.520 --> 25:17.082
Really?

25:17.122 --> 25:18.206
Yeah, what?

25:18.245 --> 25:18.847
Really?

25:18.888 --> 25:22.659
I'm sorry the perfect girl wasn't dumped in front of me when I was eighteen years old.

25:22.700 --> 25:24.424
Do you talk to Gabby?

25:24.465 --> 25:26.311
Do you even have discussions with the girl?

25:26.350 --> 25:28.999
Do you want me to translate that into fucking His- Spanish?

25:29.039 --> 25:30.122
Into Hispanic?

25:30.163 --> 25:31.206
Whatever the fuck it is.

25:31.647 --> 25:34.014
Yeah, what do you think, we're mutes?

25:34.053 --> 25:37.224
And we just .... like sign to each other?

25:37.264 --> 25:38.789
Yeah we talk, stupid.

25:38.829 --> 25:39.751
Gabby's a trip.

25:39.793 --> 25:40.674
You know she's a trip.

25:40.715 --> 25:43.122
You should hear the shit that comes out of her mouth.

25:43.122 --> 25:43.603
You know what?

25:43.644 --> 25:44.646
She would be great on Jeopardy.

25:43.925 --> 25:45.249
She's way smarter than I am.

25:45.289 --> 25:47.094
All right, so you see what I'm talking about.

25:47.134 --> 25:47.938
That's all I want

25:47.938 --> 25:50.906
I know you want a chick like my girl, but I'll kill you if you touch her.

25:50.947 --> 25:51.508
Fuck!

25:51.508 --> 25:52.310
I'm going to kill you!

25:52.350 --> 25:53.515
Shut up!

25:57.647 --> 25:58.731
What's this chick's name?

25:58.731 --> 26:00.938
You don't deserve to fucking know her name.

26:02.421 --> 26:03.625
Dude, fuck that!

26:05.231 --> 26:05.872
Jannet.

26:05.912 --> 26:06.795
Did you run her?

26:06.835 --> 26:08.681
Yes, she's clean.

26:09.483 --> 26:10.968
She's kind of the complete package.

26:13.977 --> 26:14.940
We're going out again.

26:16.024 --> 26:18.311
Saturday's my little sister's quinceanera.

26:18.351 --> 26:20.076
You should roll through with Jannet from another planet.

26:20.117 --> 26:22.845
The shit's going to be hardcore Mexican, though.

26:22.885 --> 26:24.891
You know how my familia rolls.

26:57.993 --> 26:58.755
Hey, mija.

26:59.759 --> 27:00.601
What's up?

27:01.283 --> 27:04.814
Come here, baby girl. Drink the Jim Jones, baby, come on.

27:07.503 --> 27:08.105
Hey baby?

27:08.145 --> 27:09.308
Tell me something.

27:09.348 --> 27:10.913
You ever fucked on heroin?

27:10.913 --> 27:12.357
Yeah right.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.605
I could fuck forever on that shit.

27:15.888 --> 27:17.775
I'll eat your pussy for hours, girl.

27:17.814 --> 27:19.259
Get the fuck over here.

27:19.298 --> 27:21.466
Fuck that fool, he's crazy, he's tripping.

27:21.505 --> 27:23.632
You're my fucking lady.

27:23.673 --> 27:25.318
I'll buy you shit.

27:25.357 --> 27:27.525
You see this shit right here?

27:27.564 --> 27:28.808
It's fucking money.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.814
Real shit.

27:30.856 --> 27:32.019
What you like?

27:32.059 --> 27:34.786
Come here.

27:34.828 --> 27:35.390
Ok.

27:35.429 --> 27:38.639
Any Newton unit.

27:38.679 --> 27:39.522
Five oh seven party.

27:39.562 --> 27:40.886
Three six four five Trinity Street.

27:40.886 --> 27:43.654
Incident thirty eight ninety and RD thirteen seventy-six.

27:43.694 --> 27:45.420
X nine, send me the call

27:45.420 --> 27:46.463
X Nine roger.

27:46.503 --> 27:49.232
X twenty five shows code six of x nine.

27:49.272 --> 27:50.756
Twenty-five roger.

27:50.796 --> 27:52.241
X thirteen, we're going to be code six on the party call.

27:52.241 --> 27:53.003
X thirteen, roger.

28:02.271 --> 28:02.793
Cops!

28:02.793 --> 28:03.636
Cops!

28:09.093 --> 28:11.982
OFFICER Keep your eyes wide, this place is assholed up.

28:12.021 --> 28:13.546
Clear the car.

28:24.500 --> 28:25.865
Put that shit away.

28:27.830 --> 28:28.593
Put that down

28:35.615 --> 28:36.497
What's the occasion?

28:43.118 --> 28:44.843
Can you turn down the music?

28:51.423 --> 28:52.748
Have some respect, La La.

28:52.788 --> 28:54.312
Don't light up in front of us.

28:54.352 --> 28:56.239
Why don't you take a hit, mija.

28:56.279 --> 28:57.402
It'll chill you out.

28:57.442 --> 28:59.127
It'll be like back in the days.

28:59.168 --> 29:00.291
Remember?

29:00.331 --> 29:01.375
No, I don't remember shit.

29:01.414 --> 29:02.738
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

29:02.738 --> 29:03.380
I said put it out.

29:05.226 --> 29:07.472
You know you want this, pig.

29:08.074 --> 29:11.084
I wouldn't fucking touch that if you were the last bitch on earth.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.248
Fuck you.

29:12.288 --> 29:13.250
No, fuck you.

29:13.250 --> 29:14.213
Why don't you take a seat.

29:14.254 --> 29:15.979
You look in the mirror, you're just a common fucking gangster bitch (on) like all the rest.

29:15.979 --> 29:16.381
Lock it up, Orozco.

29:17.905 --> 29:19.109
Why don't you sit your ass down.

29:19.149 --> 29:20.794
Why don't you do what the fuck they tell you, puppet?

29:20.834 --> 29:21.516
Want me to make you?

29:21.556 --> 29:22.159
Lock it up, partner.

29:23.161 --> 29:24.084
You know what?

29:25.168 --> 29:26.973
I'll fucking sit down now.

29:26.973 --> 29:27.936
Thank you.

29:27.976 --> 29:29.180
Thank you very much.

29:38.810 --> 29:42.942
So Mr. Big Evil... why do they call you Big Evil?

29:45.029 --> 29:48.400
Because ... my evil is big.

30:07.498 --> 30:09.986
Can you turn down the music, because we got a noise complaint or some shit.

30:39.798 --> 30:40.841
Then you go faster.

30:45.496 --> 30:46.780
I am nailing this.

31:05.036 --> 31:05.598
Hey bro.

31:05.637 --> 31:05.878
Hey.

31:07.925 --> 31:08.367
Hi baby.

31:08.406 --> 31:08.847
Cindy, what's up?

31:08.847 --> 31:10.332
I wanted to introduce you to Janet.

31:10.372 --> 31:11.938
Hi. It's so nice to meet you.

31:11.977 --> 31:12.579
Happy birthday.

31:12.619 --> 31:13.903
You look beautiful.

31:13.903 --> 31:14.666
Thank you.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.070
Pick up your dress so you don't step on it.

31:16.070 --> 31:16.551
Yeah.

31:16.551 --> 31:17.033
You look beautiful.

31:17.073 --> 31:17.635
I gotta go.

31:17.635 --> 31:18.035
Bye!

31:18.035 --> 31:18.477
Bye

31:18.517 --> 31:19.079
All grown up.

31:19.118 --> 31:19.882
He spoils her.

31:19.922 --> 31:21.045
But I want to give you the lowdown.

31:21.085 --> 31:22.249
I'm listening.

31:22.289 --> 31:24.135
Everybody here is pretty much family.

31:24.175 --> 31:25.218
Like somehow.

31:25.258 --> 31:26.582
They're all Mexican family.

31:26.622 --> 31:31.919
You got cousins and you got aunts and uncles just like everything else and then you got cousins' cousins. And then you have Brian.

31:33.403 --> 31:34.968
You stick around, you're going to see someone throw up.

31:35.008 --> 31:35.851
Couple fights.

31:35.892 --> 31:36.694
It's fun.

31:36.733 --> 31:37.255
It's fun.

31:37.295 --> 31:38.137
Enough, enough.

31:38.178 --> 31:39.462
I'm sorry.

31:39.502 --> 31:41.147
Well, I'm Irish, so it's the same thing..

31:41.147 --> 31:43.435
Big families, and no one gets divorced.

31:43.474 --> 31:44.758
And they all wear purple.

31:44.798 --> 31:48.008
Well, less purple... but just as much beer.

31:48.048 --> 31:50.777
They get way too drunk and get in fistfights.

31:50.817 --> 31:51.419
Yeah, same here.

31:51.459 --> 31:53.505
But you mess with one person you have the whole family after you.

31:53.545 --> 31:54.508
That's the way to do it.

31:54.548 --> 31:55.512
There you go.

31:55.552 --> 31:56.595
You just described Mexican people.

31:56.635 --> 31:57.678
Can I feel it?

31:57.719 --> 31:58.600
Is that ok?

31:58.641 --> 31:59.805
Yeah, he's actually kicking a lot right now.

31:59.844 --> 32:01.210
And I think his feet are right there.

32:02.815 --> 32:03.616
Do you feel it?

32:03.657 --> 32:04.940
Wow.

32:04.980 --> 32:05.984
Oh my god.

32:06.024 --> 32:07.428
I like her, Brian.

32:08.191 --> 32:08.672
Buddy.

32:08.712 --> 32:09.755
How long have you know Brian?.

32:09.796 --> 32:10.638
Three years.

32:10.678 --> 32:12.443
He and Mike went to the Academy together.

32:12.485 --> 32:13.366
Right.

33:03.200 --> 33:03.882
Brian, it's you.

33:17.484 --> 33:17.966
Hi.

33:21.336 --> 33:22.700
I'm going to try not to wake you up.

33:28.278 --> 33:30.084
I can't believe that I stayed over.

33:33.293 --> 33:34.858
This is interesting.

33:36.463 --> 33:37.466
I have never shot one before.

33:40.075 --> 33:41.239
Maybe that could be our next date.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.256
I did go through your wallet.

33:47.296 --> 33:47.938
I'm sorry.

33:47.979 --> 33:49.263
I am naturally curious.

33:50.345 --> 33:51.389
I hope that's ok.

33:53.275 --> 33:57.086
Gotta love a guys who has a picture of his mom in his wallet.

34:00.739 --> 34:01.380
This?

34:03.466 --> 34:09.605
Kristin, Mia, Raquel, etcetera, etcetera... You won't be needing this anymore.

34:18.672 --> 34:19.556
You were drooling.

34:35.967 --> 34:36.929
What are we looking for again?

34:36.929 --> 34:39.577
All the food groups: dope, money and guns.

34:39.618 --> 34:40.782
The ghetto will provide.

34:48.887 --> 34:49.728
Fucking Sarge.

34:49.768 --> 34:52.257
Serge, We're staking out Curbside.

34:52.297 --> 34:53.501
They're going to spot your unit.

34:53.541 --> 34:54.744
You think they don't know you're here?

34:55.949 --> 34:58.235
Van Hauser wants to file a complaint on you, Taylor.

34:58.276 --> 34:59.840
The USS Van Hauser?

34:59.881 --> 35:03.010
LAPD's stealthiest submarine, only surfaces at the end of watch?

35:03.010 --> 35:05.017
He said you were videotaping him.

35:05.017 --> 35:06.460
What did I tell you about that shit?

35:07.344 --> 35:08.829
Why is he such a bitter dude?

35:08.869 --> 35:11.636
If he hates pushing the black and white so much, why doesn't he just leave his badge

35:11.677 --> 35:14.085
on the watch commander's desk and go home and eat a bowl of dicks?

35:14.124 --> 35:15.769
Have some empathy for this man.

35:16.692 --> 35:20.103
Taylor, I gotta put in m log that I verbally counseled you about this fucking camera.

35:20.143 --> 35:20.826
What?

35:20.865 --> 35:22.269
I was documenting a crime scene.

35:22.310 --> 35:23.553
Have a good day, ladies.

35:23.594 --> 35:24.757
Take it easy.

35:41.008 --> 35:42.813
Is that Big Evil's mom right there?

35:42.813 --> 35:43.535
His mom?

35:43.575 --> 35:44.177
Yeah, that's Mrs.Evil.

35:46.063 --> 35:46.905
Who's the cowboy?

35:46.946 --> 35:48.149
I don't know.

35:48.189 --> 35:50.034
He's got money, look at his truck.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.042
I'm going to run him.

35:51.961 --> 35:53.165
You want to jam this fool?

35:53.165 --> 35:54.088
Yes I do.

35:57.378 --> 35:58.060
Plate's clean.

35:58.101 --> 35:59.585
Shit.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.069
What's our PC?

36:01.912 --> 36:04.882
That stupid CD hanging from his rearview mirror, obstructing his vision.

36:06.125 --> 36:06.928
Let's do this.

36:06.967 --> 36:07.891
All right-.

36:19.204 --> 36:19.928
Come on, fucker.

36:19.968 --> 36:20.972
Wait wait wait.

36:23.860 --> 36:24.382
Light them up.

36:25.264 --> 36:29.396
Thirteen-x-ray-thirteen, we're code six on three nine street east of Wall.

36:29.878 --> 36:32.367
License plate four boy one seven three two.

36:32.406 --> 36:33.289
Grey Dodge pickup.

36:33.810 --> 36:35.174
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

36:35.214 --> 36:36.459
Let's get this fucker.

36:47.412 --> 36:53.070
We stopped you because a CD is hanging from your mirror. Get out of the truck.

36:52.628 --> 36:53.350
Gun!

36:54.956 --> 37:00.413
Get the fuck out of the car... Get the fuck out of the car.

37:02.700 --> 37:03.462
You good, partner?

37:03.904 --> 37:04.426
I'm good.

37:06.271 --> 37:08.798
X twenty five shows code six with x thirteen.

37:08.839 --> 37:10.765
Thirteen x two five, roger.

37:13.292 --> 37:13.854
You ok?

37:17.907 --> 37:19.552
***

37:19.591 --> 37:20.675
Transport this son of a bitch.

37:20.675 --> 37:21.277
No problem.

37:27.777 --> 37:28.539
Check out this motherfucker's burner.

37:29.422 --> 37:30.104
Holy shit.

37:31.187 --> 37:32.952
He's got more bling than the old lady's wedding ring.

37:37.768 --> 37:38.168
A cell.

37:38.932 --> 37:39.894
You don't have any holes in you?

37:40.415 --> 37:40.977
I'm good.

37:41.019 --> 37:41.900
Let's toss the truck.

37:43.826 --> 37:44.909
Who was he shooting at?

37:44.949 --> 37:45.953
What?

37:45.993 --> 37:47.036
Who was he shooting at?

37:47.077 --> 37:47.759
Me.

37:48.761 --> 37:49.404
That's fucked up.

37:53.656 --> 37:54.901
Air eleven, show us responding.

38:02.604 --> 38:05.573
Fucking ... soup.

38:10.227 --> 38:10.789
What's up?

38:14.200 --> 38:15.765
That's big money right there.

38:15.805 --> 38:16.689
Shit.

38:22.546 --> 38:23.268
Oh shit.

38:27.642 --> 38:28.404
What the fuck is it?

38:29.809 --> 38:30.531
Homeboy's a player.

38:31.895 --> 38:32.938
We got a surprise for you.

38:32.938 --> 38:35.305
Liberace's AK.

38:43.972 --> 38:44.855
Holy shit.

38:47.142 --> 38:51.154
Here we have two of the major food groups: money and guns.

38:51.195 --> 38:53.361
This is the lifeblood of our organization.

38:53.402 --> 38:55.207
Paperwork.

38:55.207 --> 39:01.506
The way red corpuscles carry oxygen through the body... paperwork carries information through the department.

39:02.750 --> 39:03.753
What are corpuscles?

39:03.753 --> 39:04.395
Evening, guys.

39:05.238 --> 39:06.842
How you doing, captain?

39:06.842 --> 39:07.806
Sir.

39:07.846 --> 39:08.167
So this is it?

39:08.207 --> 39:09.773
These are the guns you took off the Cowboy?

39:09.812 --> 39:10.654
Yes sir.

39:10.654 --> 39:11.376
Mind if I pick them up?

39:13.945 --> 39:15.108
Fancy.

39:15.149 --> 39:16.272
That's some nice hardware.

39:16.312 --> 39:17.716
I heard he took a shot at you.

39:17.716 --> 39:18.318
Are you ok?

39:18.318 --> 39:18.961
Yeah, I'm fine.

39:18.961 --> 39:19.521
I'm good.

39:19.563 --> 39:21.288
Liberace's AK.

39:21.328 --> 39:22.572
Looks like Liberace's AK.

39:24.537 --> 39:25.701
Keep up the good work, guys.

39:25.741 --> 39:26.384
I really appreciate it.

39:26.424 --> 39:27.145
Carry on.

39:27.145 --> 39:28.028
Thank you.

39:28.068 --> 39:28.711
Good evening, sir.

39:28.751 --> 39:29.392
Good night, Van Hauser.

39:29.433 --> 39:30.314
Evening, sir.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.004
Why do you get nervous?

39:33.004 --> 39:34.448
Women want him, men want to be him, man.

39:34.929 --> 39:35.410
He's just…

39:35.410 --> 39:35.812
Yeah, I know.

39:35.852 --> 39:36.494
But you want him.

39:36.534 --> 39:38.901
I'm not gay, but I'd go down on him if he asked.

39:41.068 --> 39:42.352
Sometimes I don't know when you're kidding.

39:42.352 --> 39:44.279
And I have to know when you're kidding.

39:44.319 --> 39:45.602
I'm not kidding.

39:45.642 --> 39:46.726
I gotta know when you're kidding.

39:46.766 --> 39:47.247
I'm not kidding.

39:53.867 --> 39:54.911
I gotta go.

39:54.951 --> 39:56.838
I'm taking Janet to the Philharmonic.

39:56.877 --> 39:58.923
Enjoy your white people shit.

39:58.963 --> 40:00.368
Thanks, I'll bring you back a burrito.

40:00.408 --> 40:01.411
No problem.

40:09.717 --> 40:14.330

One more time.

40:42.779 --> 40:44.023
Stop.

40:44.062 --> 40:45.306
Stop, man, fuck.

40:52.489 --> 40:54.696
What are you going to say to the taxpayers when you crash the fucking car?

40:57.505 --> 41:00.714
Drink more coffee.

41:00.754 --> 41:03.081
I'm on my ninth fucking Red Bull.

41:05.328 --> 41:05.970
We got a fire.

41:05.970 --> 41:06.612
Where?

41:06.653 --> 41:07.174
Go left.

41:07.214 --> 41:10.464
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen, we're code six on a structure fire.

41:10.504 --> 41:11.187
What's that address?

41:11.227 --> 41:11.989

41:12.029 --> 41:14.516
One zero zero two Sixth Street.

41:14.516 --> 41:16.603
Go ahead and send RA and fire.

41:16.644 --> 41:18.168
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

41:23.464 --> 41:26.273
My babies- my babies are in there!

41:26.313 --> 41:26.714
Where?

41:26.755 --> 41:28.962
They're upstairs in the bedroom.

41:29.002 --> 41:30.165
Z, no!

41:31.729 --> 41:32.453
Wait for fire!

41:32.492 --> 41:33.496
Fuck!

41:38.350 --> 41:39.152
Over there, kids room.

41:39.194 --> 41:39.876

41:42.764 --> 41:43.646
It's the kids' room, come on!

41:51.832 --> 41:52.474
Come here.

41:54.520 --> 41:56.205

41:58.252 --> 41:59.375
Wrap your arms around me.

00:11.435 --> 00:11.435
Wrap your legs around me.

00:11.435 --> 00:11.435
You got it.

42:00.017 --> 42:00.098
There you go.

42:00.579 --> 42:01.542
I'm going down!

42:01.582 --> 42:02.465
Come on, come on, come on.

42:02.465 --> 42:04.070
Come on.

42:03.989 --> 42:04.392
Yup.

Let's go!

42:18.354 --> 42:18.634
Let's go!

42:18.676 --> 42:19.196
Come on!

42:24.132 --> 42:25.215
Where's my baby girl?

42:25.255 --> 42:26.499
Where is she?

42:26.539 --> 42:29.027
Wait, lady, you got more kids?

42:29.067 --> 42:29.869
My girl.

42:29.909 --> 42:30.873
She's two.

42:30.913 --> 42:32.277
Oh shit.

42:32.918 --> 42:33.520
No! Z, no!

42:33.520 --> 42:34.885
Come on!

42:36.409 --> 42:38.255
Go, go go, get up!

42:38.295 --> 42:39.018

42:53.141 --> 42:53.904
Come here, babe.

42:53.943 --> 42:54.625
Come here.

42:56.190 --> 42:57.113
Cover her face.

42:57.154 --> 42:58.518
Put that blanket around her face.

42:58.518 --> 42:58.959
I got her.

43:02.088 --> 43:02.732
I can't breathe.

43:05.579 --> 43:06.543
Come on, go go go.

43:06.583 --> 43:07.826
I can't see.

43:07.866 --> 43:09.151
Where you at?

43:09.191 --> 43:10.033
I'm right here.

43:10.033 --> 43:10.715
Follow the light.

43:11.718 --> 43:12.482
I can't see you.

43:12.521 --> 43:13.925
I'm right here.

43:17.376 --> 43:18.178
Come on.

43:18.178 --> 43:19.061
I got it.

43:19.061 --> 43:20.065
I got her.

43:20.065 --> 43:21.027
Shit.

43:23.876 --> 43:24.517
I'm going down.

43:24.559 --> 43:25.281
Come on.

43:25.320 --> 43:26.484
All right.

43:35.713 --> 43:36.516
Stay still.

43:42.855 --> 43:43.617
Fuck, I got it.

43:48.031 --> 43:49.274
I fucking can't see out of my...

44:01.712 --> 44:02.315
Where's Z?

44:02.315 --> 44:03.679
I'm right here.

44:04.281 --> 44:05.644
I'm going to check you out, sit down right here.

44:05.685 --> 44:06.688
Can you open your eyes?

44:08.615 --> 44:09.336
You all right?

44:09.376 --> 44:10.460
Give me a bottle of water.

44:14.914 --> 44:15.716
Get the fuck away!

44:15.716 --> 44:16.679
I'm right here.

44:16.679 --> 44:17.442
I'm right here.

44:17.442 --> 44:18.765
Get away, get away.

44:18.806 --> 44:19.849
I'm right here.

44:19.889 --> 44:20.652
Fuck.

44:20.692 --> 44:21.294
Get away.

44:21.333 --> 44:23.019
I'm right here.

44:23.059 --> 44:23.901
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

44:23.941 --> 44:24.824
Don't fucking freak out.

44:24.824 --> 44:27.351
Shut up, shut up We're good, we're good.

44:27.351 --> 44:27.913
Shut up.

44:37.383 --> 44:46.330
For their selfless actions and their exemplary service to the citizens of this city... the Medal of Valor is presented to Officer Brian Taylor….

44:48.537 --> 44:51.828
and Officer Miguel Zavala.

45:04.467 --> 45:05.430
What's up, Sandra?

45:06.753 --> 45:07.435
Hi Brian.

45:13.013 --> 45:13.896
You feel like a hero?

45:13.936 --> 45:15.180
What?

45:16.825 --> 45:17.867
You feel like a hero?

45:20.316 --> 45:20.877
No.

45:23.124 --> 45:23.887
Yeah, me neither.

45:27.417 --> 45:28.580
What's a hero feel like?

45:32.432 --> 45:33.115
I don't know.

45:37.167 --> 45:40.417
Did I tell you that me and Gabby got into a huge fight over the fire?

45:40.457 --> 45:42.905
Nope, you didn't tell me that.

45:45.513 --> 45:52.375
She's like ‘you could have died for someone else's kid when ours hasn't even been born yet.

45:53.216 --> 45:54.340
She's like ‘you're not a fireman.

45:54.380 --> 45:56.628
Janet said the same thing.

45:56.628 --> 45:57.390
Yeah?

46:00.038 --> 46:02.726
I don't think I can go into another burning building.

46:02.766 --> 46:03.970
I only went in because you did.

46:05.576 --> 46:06.659
Now you know.

46:17.050 --> 46:18.254
All right, dickhead, what is it?

46:24.274 --> 46:26.359
You remember that cowboy with the blinged out AK?

46:27.242 --> 46:28.928
Yeah, he's probably my cousin.

46:28.968 --> 46:30.452
I crisscrossed some numbers on his cell.

46:30.491 --> 46:32.097
Couple addresses come up in our basic area.

46:32.097 --> 46:33.300
You're not a detective.

46:33.300 --> 46:34.384
That guy is something.

46:34.424 --> 46:34.945
He's into something.

46:34.986 --> 46:36.069
Oh really, you think?

46:37.073 --> 46:39.680
DA didn't buy the ADW and only filed on the weapons beef.

46:39.721 --> 46:42.409
Gang Unit says they'll get it him but they're too busy or some shit.

46:42.449 --> 46:44.656
And Narco's not interested because we didn't find dope.

46:45.257 --> 46:46.583
Yeah, but you're not a detective.

46:46.622 --> 46:47.625
You're not a fireman.

46:47.665 --> 46:48.266
Fuck you.

46:48.306 --> 46:50.233
Follow me into the house, dude.

46:51.117 --> 46:52.840
I said you're not a detective.

46:52.882 --> 46:53.684
I want to be a detective.

46:53.724 --> 46:54.325
You wanna be?

46:54.526 --> 46:55.530
Follow me into the house, dude.

46:55.530 --> 46:56.894
Follow me into the house.

46:58.820 --> 46:59.943
Follow me into the house.

47:10.575 --> 47:15.311
Thirteen-x-thirteen with a code six at ninethree one eight five three street.

47:16.072 --> 47:17.518
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

47:32.924 --> 47:33.768
The fuck?

47:34.609 --> 47:35.413
What the fuck?

47:37.940 --> 47:38.622
This is weird.

47:49.135 --> 47:51.462
Thirteen x-ray thirteen, you need to send us additional unit.

47:52.184 --> 47:57.240
Thirteen-x-thirteen is requesting two additional units for a building search at one zero zero two six street.

48:09.718 --> 48:10.241
It's ok, it's ok.

48:10.280 --> 48:11.242
it's ok.

48:11.242 --> 48:12.487
Open the door.

48:12.527 --> 48:14.051
It's ok. Goodbye.

48:15.336 --> 48:16.258
Fuck this guy.

48:25.487 --> 48:26.732
Get that shit out of here.

48:26.770 --> 48:27.814
I know what that means.

48:29.459 --> 48:30.583
Shut the fuck up.

48:30.622 --> 48:32.549
Spread your legs.

48:35.197 --> 48:35.878
Spread your fucking legs.

48:39.008 --> 48:40.012
Put your fucking head back.

48:42.178 --> 48:42.941
Gun, partner.

48:42.981 --> 48:43.863
Oh yeah?

48:50.524 --> 48:51.286
Get your fucking head back.

48:55.420 --> 48:56.502
Another gun, partner.

48:56.543 --> 48:57.465
Two?

49:02.200 --> 49:03.003
Wads of cash.

49:04.046 --> 49:05.290
Tell him to get on his knees.

49:09.142 --> 49:10.546
Get the fuck over here.

49:13.917 --> 49:15.200
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen.

49:15.240 --> 49:15.882
We've got one in custody.

49:15.922 --> 49:17.407
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

49:17.447 --> 49:18.451
All right, we're good.

49:18.490 --> 49:19.413
All right.

49:28.682 --> 49:29.244
What do we got?

49:31.531 --> 49:32.293
Check it out, partner.

49:33.657 --> 49:34.540
I got this motherfucker.

49:43.327 --> 49:44.090
Oh my god.

50:09.248 --> 50:10.089
Take my buddy.

50:10.130 --> 50:11.655
What the fuck, Zavala, you catch them, I clean them?

50:11.695 --> 50:12.537
Take him.

50:14.704 --> 50:15.547
I don't know, we got like-

50:16.991 --> 50:17.834
I'm going to go outside.

50:17.874 --> 50:18.556
Z, you good?

50:18.596 --> 50:19.078
I'm good.

50:19.078 --> 50:19.438
Z!

50:19.438 --> 50:20.080
I'm good.

50:22.167 --> 50:24.174
What are you doing with all these people?

50:24.214 --> 50:25.176
You're a fucking asshole.

50:25.216 --> 50:26.179
Asshole.

50:26.219 --> 50:27.103
What the fuck?

50:29.389 --> 50:29.951
Federal agents.

50:30.392 --> 50:31.195
Who's in charge here?

50:31.235 --> 50:32.199
Are you in charge?

50:32.238 --> 50:33.200
What the fuck.

50:33.200 --> 50:34.204
I need to know who's in charge here.

50:34.244 --> 50:35.689
Is this man under arrest?

50:35.729 --> 50:36.211
Yes sir.

50:36.251 --> 50:37.614
What are the charges against this man?

50:37.655 --> 50:39.018
Turn that fucking camera off.

50:39.018 --> 50:39.460
It's off.

50:39.460 --> 50:40.223
Get that fucking camera off me.

50:40.825 --> 50:42.349
You guys fucked up.

50:42.389 --> 50:44.316
Just lost a POI because of you guys.

50:44.355 --> 50:45.639
Are we clear in there?

50:45.680 --> 50:46.361
Clear.

50:47.325 --> 50:48.288
What the fuck?

50:48.328 --> 50:49.732
What did we fuck up?

50:49.772 --> 50:50.615
I don't fucking know, dude.

50:50.655 --> 50:52.019
Who the fuck is this guy?

50:52.019 --> 50:52.982
I don't fucking know.

51:16.334 --> 51:18.100
We have one POI.

51:18.982 --> 51:20.507
I just want to fucking talk to this guy.

51:20.507 --> 51:21.269
Let's just get out of here.

51:21.269 --> 51:22.714
I just want to fucking talk to him just for a second.

51:23.436 --> 51:24.480
Go ahead.

51:26.646 --> 51:31.381
I don't want to cause any trouble here, but we just fucking – we rolled up here, I don't know what's going on.

51:31.420 --> 51:33.747
This is the second cowboy like this we've run into in a week.

51:33.747 --> 51:35.313
Watch out for these guys.

51:35.353 --> 51:36.878
They operate by a different set of rules.

51:36.918 --> 51:40.368
I know I'm just a ghetto street cop but you've got to give me something here.

51:40.409 --> 51:42.936
We've got indicators he's a runner for the Sinaloa Cartel.

51:42.976 --> 51:44.902
We ran him, he came up clean.

51:44.902 --> 51:48.513
You guys don't have the proper clearance for any of this information, but I'm going to throw you a bone.

51:49.155 --> 51:50.439
Cartels are operating here.

51:50.479 --> 51:51.482
We're on it.

51:51.522 --> 51:52.366
Be careful.

51:52.406 --> 51:53.849
What does that mean though?

51:53.890 --> 51:56.940
It means you and your homeboy need to power down.

51:56.980 --> 52:00.912
Because you just tugged on the tail of the snake and it's going to turn around and bite you back.

52:00.952 --> 52:01.996
I'm throwing you a bone here.

52:02.036 --> 52:03.400
Be grateful for what I'm giving you.

52:03.400 --> 52:04.041
I'm giving you a warning.

52:04.081 --> 52:05.566
Lay low.

52:06.770 --> 52:08.054
Can I get your name for my log.?

52:08.094 --> 52:09.257
Negative, move along.

52:10.581 --> 52:11.304
Yeah, all right.

52:13.752 --> 52:15.397
You know there's five year old kids in there?

52:15.436 --> 52:16.680
For six months?

52:16.720 --> 52:17.564
Good bye.

52:17.604 --> 52:18.767
Get off the crime scene.

52:18.767 --> 52:19.609
Go home.

52:19.649 --> 52:20.011
Bye.

52:20.051 --> 52:20.733
Have a nice night.

52:20.733 --> 52:22.659
Yeah. Fucking feds.

52:22.700 --> 52:22.980
Z, what the fuck?

52:23.020 --> 52:23.903
Fuck them.

52:32.649 --> 52:34.255
I didn't think that shit came over here.

52:35.820 --> 52:36.582
Kids, women.

52:36.622 --> 52:37.666
Did you see that fucking toilet?

52:37.706 --> 52:38.588
Filled up with shit.

52:41.838 --> 52:43.604
We had no fucking business being there.

52:43.604 --> 52:44.687
We didn't even have a call there.

52:44.727 --> 52:46.412
I didn't know what we were fucking rolling up on.

52:46.452 --> 52:47.817
You think I knew what we were rolling up on?

52:56.322 --> 52:57.206
It's human trafficking.

53:25.974 --> 53:26.737
He's so cute.

53:26.777 --> 53:28.301
You did so good.

53:30.268 --> 53:30.748
I love this smell.

53:32.795 --> 53:33.998
Just hold his head a little bit.

53:33.998 --> 53:35.242
I am.

53:35.284 --> 53:35.925
He's fine.

53:35.925 --> 53:39.737
You gotta hold him like this, like a football.

53:39.776 --> 53:41.342
I know how to hold a baby.

53:46.036 --> 53:47.199
Babe, please.

53:47.199 --> 53:47.842
Like that.

53:47.842 --> 53:48.844
Hey.

53:48.844 --> 53:49.446
Hi!

53:49.446 --> 53:51.252
Hey partner, what's up?

53:51.292 --> 53:52.657
Come here.

53:57.471 --> 53:58.033
Look who's here.

53:58.073 --> 53:59.839
How's mama doing?

53:59.878 --> 54:01.324
Mama's tired and cranky.

54:01.324 --> 54:03.169
Just like baby.

54:03.169 --> 54:04.935
Mama wants to choke Daddy.

54:04.974 --> 54:06.057
Come on, babe.

54:06.098 --> 54:07.743
Did you name him Brian?

54:07.783 --> 54:09.067
Sorry.

54:10.190 --> 54:10.913
He's a junior.

54:10.954 --> 54:12.157
Named him after his daddy.

54:12.197 --> 54:13.480
So what's his name?

54:16.169 --> 54:17.012
Fuck you.

54:17.051 --> 54:19.178
Can I hold him?

54:20.462 --> 54:21.024
Yeah.

54:31.336 --> 54:32.219
So sweet.

54:33.784 --> 54:34.987
You're so done.

54:48.630 --> 54:49.232
Hey baby.

54:50.997 --> 54:51.679
What are you wearing?

54:51.719 --> 54:54.006
I can say it.

54:54.046 --> 54:54.688
What are you wearing?

54:56.935 --> 54:57.577
I don't care.

54:57.617 --> 54:58.218
You still look good.

54:59.784 --> 55:00.747
Yeah, Brian's right here.

55:00.787 --> 55:02.872
OK.

55:02.914 --> 55:03.996
All right, sorry.

55:04.558 --> 55:05.401
OK, I love you.

55:05.401 --> 55:05.883
Bye.

55:07.006 --> 55:07.728
You didn't even say hi.

55:07.769 --> 55:09.174
She was pissed.

55:13.184 --> 55:14.510
How'd you know you were going to marry Gabby?

55:14.510 --> 55:15.191
She told me.

55:15.232 --> 55:19.324
I was just some stoner working at my uncle's muffler shop and one day she grabbed me by the shoulders...

55:19.324 --> 55:22.213
and said ‘we're getting married and you're joining the department'

55:22.253 --> 55:25.303
because you can make a lot of money without a college degree and I was like ‘fuck yeah'.

55:25.343 --> 55:27.268
I mean, you love her.

55:27.309 --> 55:29.475
You guys, you never fight.

55:29.516 --> 55:30.639
You're happy together.

55:30.719 --> 55:31.923
She's my bitch for sure.

55:33.368 --> 55:34.732
I'm just telling you the way it went down.

55:35.895 --> 55:36.939
I popped her cherry in high school.

55:37.580 --> 55:39.186
She's never been with anybody else.

55:39.225 --> 55:40.629
I've never wanted to be with anybody else.

55:41.151 --> 55:42.075
You know, it's easy.

55:43.478 --> 55:45.525
Things are getting super serious with Janet and me.

55:45.565 --> 55:46.809
What, you just found that out?

55:46.849 --> 55:48.534
Did you read that in the paper or something?

55:48.574 --> 55:50.099
Homegirl owns your ass.

55:51.343 --> 55:52.065
She wants to move in.

55:53.188 --> 55:53.790
She's always over.

55:53.830 --> 55:55.155
Why spend the money on two apartments.

55:55.757 --> 55:56.921
It's not about the money.

55:56.960 --> 55:59.769
No, her parents are so traditional.

55:59.769 --> 56:00.773
Oh yeah?

56:00.812 --> 56:01.575
They will go ballistic.

56:02.456 --> 56:04.062
But at least we can tell them we're engaged.

56:05.186 --> 56:05.707
Hold up.

56:05.747 --> 56:07.112
Don't play with that shit.

56:07.152 --> 56:11.245
You don't ask a broad to marry you because her folks are old school.

56:11.245 --> 56:12.288
No, you don't understand.

56:12.328 --> 56:14.013
No, you don't do that shit.

56:14.053 --> 56:15.417
Think about it.

56:15.457 --> 56:18.186
After you think about it, think about it again.

56:18.226 --> 56:19.591
Jesus.

56:19.631 --> 56:21.356
Marriage is forever.

56:21.396 --> 56:22.520
Just realize that.

56:23.764 --> 56:24.927
It's a promise before god.

56:27.454 --> 56:31.025
My grandma was really deep.

56:32.630 --> 56:33.312
She's seen it all.

56:33.353 --> 56:34.636
You know what I'm saying?

56:36.202 --> 56:38.328
When me and Gabby got engaged, she asked me one thing.

56:38.367 --> 56:39.171
Do you want to hear it?

56:39.211 --> 56:40.454
Fine, let's hear it.

56:41.818 --> 56:43.624
She said can you live without her?

56:46.313 --> 56:49.643
And if the answer's yes, man up and forget her.

56:50.125 --> 56:50.886
Don't string her along.

56:52.411 --> 56:53.213
Think about it.

56:54.699 --> 56:55.420
I did.

57:06.334 --> 57:07.699
Thirteen-x-ray- forty-three.

57:07.739 --> 57:08.541
Officer needs help.

57:08.581 --> 57:09.183
Where?

57:09.223 --> 57:10.588
Newton units, stand by.

57:10.628 --> 57:11.791
X forty-three officer needs help.

57:11.831 --> 57:13.315
Thirteen x forty-three, what's your location?

57:13.356 --> 57:14.399
I don't know.

57:14.439 --> 57:15.041
What?

57:15.081 --> 57:16.366
That's Van Hauser's car.

57:16.406 --> 57:17.128
Come on, Boot!

57:17.167 --> 57:17.930
Just book it south.

57:18.171 --> 57:18.492
Go.

57:19.736 --> 57:20.980
Find a street sign, put it out.

57:21.220 --> 57:22.424
I don't see any!

57:22.424 --> 57:23.387
***

57:24.470 --> 57:25.353
Is there a number on a house?

57:25.393 --> 57:25.955
A building number?

57:25.994 --> 57:27.882
The house is three one seven seven.

57:27.921 --> 57:28.925
Sir, back up!

57:30.570 --> 57:31.211
Holy shit.

57:31.252 --> 57:32.375
Hook a left on Maple.

57:33.699 --> 57:36.146
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen show us responding code three from three zero and Maple.

57:36.186 --> 57:37.511
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

57:37.551 --> 57:39.236
Responding code three Maple and three zero.

57:40.400 --> 57:41.042
Right there!

57:42.887 --> 57:46.538
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen show us code six at Compton and three one street.

57:46.578 --> 57:47.301
Who is that?

57:47.341 --> 57:48.505
Taylor and Zavala.

57:48.545 --> 57:51.354
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen, send me an airship to set up a perimeter.

57:51.394 --> 57:52.316
Oh shit.

57:52.357 --> 57:53.561
Would you call for a rescue?

57:53.601 --> 57:54.563
Do not move.

57:54.603 --> 57:55.246
What did he look like?

57:55.246 --> 57:55.647
Where'd he go?

57:55.686 --> 57:57.011
Northbound through the houses.

57:57.933 --> 58:01.144
Hispanic male, blue checkered shirt.

58:01.144 --> 58:03.671
Zerohead, he's a parolee, he's fucking huge.

58:03.711 --> 58:07.363
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen, suspect headed northbound, heavyset male Hispanic, shaved head.

58:07.403 --> 58:08.005
Weapon used was a knife.

58:08.045 --> 58:10.612
Let's do this shit.

58:10.654 --> 58:11.456
Careful, men.

58:11.496 --> 58:11.897
On your left.

58:11.937 --> 58:12.579
He's fucking huge.

58:15.187 --> 58:15.909
It's clear over here.

58:15.909 --> 58:16.471
Crossing.

58:17.113 --> 58:17.635
The windows?

58:17.635 --> 58:18.276
You got left?

58:18.317 --> 58:19.320
I got right.

58:19.360 --> 58:20.242
Push push push.

58:22.449 --> 58:23.171
You're on my elbow.

58:23.211 --> 58:23.934
You call it out.

58:23.974 --> 58:24.616
You call it out if you see it.

58:26.703 --> 58:27.144
I see him.

58:27.183 --> 58:27.665
On the left.

58:27.705 --> 58:28.107
On the left.

58:28.107 --> 58:29.070
Ready, go go, split.

58:29.070 --> 58:30.274
Take it, you bitch.

58:30.314 --> 58:30.835
Fuck you!

58:30.876 --> 58:31.397
On the left.

58:31.397 --> 58:31.919
I've got him, you ready?

58:31.919 --> 58:32.801
Fucking bitch.

58:32.801 --> 58:33.323
Fucking whore.

58:34.045 --> 58:34.526
Try to fuck with me?

58:34.526 --> 58:34.928
Fuck you!

58:34.928 --> 58:37.055
Get the fuck off her or I will blow your fucking head off.

58:37.094 --> 58:37.777
I'm done.

58:37.817 --> 58:38.459
I ain't resisting, officer.

58:38.459 --> 58:39.582
Don't fucking look at me!

58:39.622 --> 58:40.705
I ain't resisting, sir.

58:40.705 --> 58:41.428
Shut the fuck up!

58:41.468 --> 58:42.111
Get up.

58:42.111 --> 58:43.354
Put your hands over your head.

58:43.395 --> 58:43.876
Get up.

58:44.838 --> 58:46.203
Put your hands over your head.

58:46.243 --> 58:48.690
Back up towards me til I tell you to stop.

58:48.730 --> 58:49.814
Move.

58:49.854 --> 58:50.656
Move.

58:50.696 --> 58:51.419
Move.

58:51.459 --> 58:52.542
Move.

58:52.542 --> 58:53.024
Stop.

58:53.064 --> 58:55.030
Now get on your fucking knees.

58:55.070 --> 58:56.997
And cross your goddamn feet together, you hear me?

58:57.037 --> 58:57.878
Cross your legs.

58:58.762 --> 59:01.449
If I hear a fucking word out of you, I will blowyou out of your fucking socks.

59:01.489 --> 59:02.171
Hook him, Z.

59:09.274 --> 59:11.119
Thirteen-x-ray-thirteen, show a code four.

59:11.160 --> 59:11.761
Suspect's in custody.

59:11.801 --> 59:13.326
You good, Z?

59:13.367 --> 59:13.808
I'm good.

59:13.848 --> 59:14.168
Are you good?

59:15.893 --> 59:16.577
God damn it.

59:16.617 --> 59:18.623
All right, you're going to be all right.

59:18.662 --> 59:19.505
You're going to be all right.

59:21.151 --> 59:23.116
Fuck man, her face is all fucking broken.

59:23.116 --> 59:25.364
Thirteen-x-ray-thirteen requesting an additional RA.

59:25.403 --> 59:27.249
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger on the RA.

59:27.249 --> 59:28.935
We're here for you, all right?

59:28.974 --> 59:30.219
We got the cavalry coming.

59:30.259 --> 59:32.667
That motherfucker's going to pay for what he did, you hear me?

59:32.706 --> 59:34.312
Boot, you hear me?

59:34.312 --> 59:35.475
Boot?

59:35.475 --> 59:35.996
Don't call her Boot.

59:36.037 --> 59:37.160
Well I don't know what her fucking name is.

59:37.201 --> 59:38.323
Is there a tag anywhere?

59:38.364 --> 59:38.966
Do you see a tag?

59:38.966 --> 59:39.366
No.

59:41.133 --> 59:41.533
You hearing me?

59:41.573 --> 59:42.978
She's nodding, she's nodding, she hears me.

59:42.978 --> 59:44.583
You're going to be all right.

59:44.624 --> 59:45.305
Do you hear me?

59:46.348 --> 59:46.951
It's all good.

59:46.990 --> 59:47.472
It's all good.

59:53.571 --> 59:54.654
You're going to be OK, brother.

59:54.654 --> 59:55.977
Fucking cut my vest off.

59:56.019 --> 59:57.021
God damn it.

59:57.061 --> 59:57.904
I tell you one fucking thing.

59:57.944 --> 01:00:01.395
Fucking cut my vest off.

01:00:01.434 --> 01:00:02.358
All right, we got your back.

01:00:02.398 --> 01:00:03.762
Jesus Christ.

01:00:03.802 --> 01:00:05.086
God damn it.

01:00:05.127 --> 01:00:05.727
Get back, all right.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:06.330
You're good.

01:00:06.371 --> 01:00:07.614
We got your back.

01:00:07.654 --> 01:00:08.978
They cut my fucking vest.

01:00:09.018 --> 01:00:10.343
They cut my fucking vest.

01:00:11.666 --> 01:00:12.630
What's up?

01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:13.030
You OK?

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:15.559
I'm really tired.

01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:17.604
Why didn't you shoot that son of a bitch?

01:00:17.645 --> 01:00:18.568
You had him dead to rights.

01:00:20.093 --> 01:00:22.059
I just didn't feel like killing anyone tonight, Sarge.

01:00:22.098 --> 01:00:23.382
You feel like writing this up?

01:00:23.424 --> 01:00:26.311
Brass is going to want clean paper, make sure all the logs match.

01:00:26.352 --> 01:00:27.114
Sarge, did you see that?

01:00:27.155 --> 01:00:29.561
Van H had a fucking Ginsu sticking out of his eye.

01:00:30.405 --> 01:00:31.166
His eye was cut in half.

01:00:31.166 --> 01:00:32.570
The lens was hanging out.

01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:33.935
He's not coming back.

01:00:34.737 --> 01:00:35.501
Rookie too.

01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:36.664
What?

01:00:36.704 --> 01:00:37.065
She ain't coming back.

01:00:37.065 --> 01:00:39.151
She gave me this to give to the Watch commander.

01:00:39.191 --> 01:00:40.035
On the spot?

01:00:40.075 --> 01:00:40.757
Yeah.

01:00:41.478 --> 01:00:43.526
Oh well, she wouldn't have made probation anyway.

01:00:43.565 --> 01:00:44.247
Hell no.

01:00:44.287 --> 01:00:45.611
What, because her daddy's not a captain?

01:00:45.651 --> 01:00:47.176
You know she wasn't cut out for this shit.

01:00:47.216 --> 01:00:47.818
Why is that?

01:00:47.858 --> 01:00:49.022
The evidence.

01:00:49.022 --> 01:00:50.507
She almost got Van Hauser killed.

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:51.550
You guys are cold.

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:53.154
You got cold, dead eyes, you know that?

01:00:53.636 --> 01:00:54.399
Yeah, both of us.

01:00:54.439 --> 01:00:55.763
Yeah, both of you.

01:00:55.763 --> 01:00:56.204
You have a soul?

01:00:56.244 --> 01:00:57.970
Yes, we just leave it at home.

01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:00.297
We going to sit around yapping or we going to get this done?

01:01:00.336 --> 01:01:01.740
You guys saved that rookie's life.

01:01:01.781 --> 01:01:03.707
That was one big fucking fat ese.

01:01:03.748 --> 01:01:05.312
Can we clear the scene?

01:01:05.955 --> 01:01:07.759
Division's fucking falling apart over here.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.522
We good?

01:01:08.562 --> 01:01:08.964
You good?

01:01:08.964 --> 01:01:09.887
Good good good?

01:01:09.927 --> 01:01:10.889
We're all good.

01:01:10.929 --> 01:01:11.171
Yes?

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:11.692
Go back to work.

01:01:11.732 --> 01:01:12.775
Good night, ladies.

01:01:17.268 --> 01:01:19.877
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing Officer and Mrs.

01:01:19.917 --> 01:01:20.800
Taylor.

01:01:32.918 --> 01:01:34.121
What's up, guys.

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:02.634
All right.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:08.692
Janet, you got a lot of heart hooking up with a cop.

01:03:08.733 --> 01:03:14.952
Because it takes a strong person... and I see like a lot of cops' wives in here, they're all nodding their heads.

01:03:16.517 --> 01:03:17.560
You gotta take care of her.

01:03:19.085 --> 01:03:24.983
Cause I'm her big brother now. And every cop in here... we're all her family now too.

01:03:29.156 --> 01:03:30.400
I'm going to cry, baby, shut up.

01:03:32.968 --> 01:03:36.659
And Janet, we're all hoping you can make a man out of Brian.

01:03:36.699 --> 01:03:37.742
Because we've all given up.

01:03:37.783 --> 01:03:39.628
So here we go.

01:03:42.958 --> 01:03:44.042
To Brian and Janet.

01:03:45.486 --> 01:03:46.007
Cheers!

01:03:52.227 --> 01:03:53.511
Can I ask you something?

01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:57.644
Why the fuck did you get married in your dress blues?

01:03:57.684 --> 01:04:01.376
If you worked at Best Buy would you wear that fucking stupid polo shirt?

01:04:02.097 --> 01:04:03.302
I like that polo shirt.

01:04:03.342 --> 01:04:04.666
I'm representing.

01:04:07.755 --> 01:04:09.119
You know I love you, man

01:04:09.119 --> 01:04:10.122
Jesus.

01:04:10.122 --> 01:04:11.085
Here they go again.

01:04:11.125 --> 01:04:12.089
I love you too, bro.

01:04:14.094 --> 01:04:15.138
I would lay down my life for you.

01:04:15.138 --> 01:04:16.021
I love you, man.

01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:17.305
I would take a fucking bullet for you.

01:04:17.344 --> 01:04:18.748
I love you, man.

01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:21.437
Why don't you guys get married to each other?

01:04:21.477 --> 01:04:21.758
All right, shut up.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.644
Everybody take a shot.

01:04:23.684 --> 01:04:24.487
Salud!

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.413
Cheers!

01:04:40.457 --> 01:04:41.619
My boy Garcia?

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.224
He's a fucking beast.

01:04:43.264 --> 01:04:48.440
I've seen this motherfucker knock an asshole out with one punch.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.005
Yoked assholes, man.

01:04:50.046 --> 01:04:52.534
Yoked assholes from the joint when they had weight piles.

01:04:52.814 --> 01:04:53.817
You know what I'm talking about?

01:04:53.857 --> 01:04:55.623
You don't know what I'm talking about, you're fucking twelve years old.

01:04:56.184 --> 01:05:00.398
Cops like him... Like soldiers.

01:05:02.364 --> 01:05:03.688
He took a bullet for me.

01:05:05.614 --> 01:05:06.858
My bullet.

01:05:06.898 --> 01:05:08.342
He took my bullet.

01:05:13.237 --> 01:05:14.240
He took my bullet.

01:05:14.281 --> 01:05:16.367
That's what he was.

01:05:16.406 --> 01:05:17.290
That's what he was to me.

01:05:17.891 --> 01:05:19.015
It should have been me.

01:05:19.055 --> 01:05:20.459
Cause he was a good guy.

01:05:22.064 --> 01:05:23.108
I was shit.

01:05:26.398 --> 01:05:27.160
Fuck it.

01:05:37.472 --> 01:05:38.113
Gimme a kiss.

01:05:39.157 --> 01:05:40.241
You'll learn this.

01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:40.802
You'll learn.

01:05:40.843 --> 01:05:43.250
Marriage is really basic.

01:05:44.413 --> 01:05:46.820
There's just a couple guidelines.

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:49.268
One: you've got to give it up all the time.

01:05:50.632 --> 01:05:51.556
All the time.

01:05:51.556 --> 01:05:52.318
You love that.

01:05:53.441 --> 01:05:54.605
I don't hate that idea.

01:05:55.488 --> 01:05:56.170
It's not a bad idea.

01:05:55.488 --> 01:05:56.732
It's not a bad thing.

01:05:56.732 --> 01:05:59.781
No, seriously, girls throw it at cops.

01:05:59.821 --> 01:06:01.065
Throw what exactly?

01:06:01.104 --> 01:06:01.947
Their pussy.

01:06:01.988 --> 01:06:03.473
Girls throw it.

01:06:04.195 --> 01:06:05.719
So you can't give him an excuse, girlfriend.

01:06:05.759 --> 01:06:07.204
You can not give him an excuse.

01:06:07.244 --> 01:06:08.247
I've actually seen that before.

01:06:08.287 --> 01:06:10.695
It's called assault on a peace officer.

01:06:11.618 --> 01:06:12.018
You ready?

01:06:12.018 --> 01:06:12.340
Hell yeah.

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:14.105
Try new things.

01:06:14.105 --> 01:06:14.427
Baby...

01:06:14.867 --> 01:06:16.231
Like the gooch.

01:06:16.231 --> 01:06:17.556
The what?

01:06:18.077 --> 01:06:19.081
The gooch?

01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:20.966
Texas twister.

01:06:21.006 --> 01:06:22.411
No, that's something that's made up.

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:23.775
The internet made that up.

01:06:23.775 --> 01:06:25.058
You want to know what Mike likes?

01:06:25.099 --> 01:06:25.661
No!

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:28.590
No!

01:06:30.676 --> 01:06:32.402
Babe, I love you so much.

01:06:32.402 --> 01:06:34.006
The western, you know?

01:06:34.047 --> 01:06:35.812
Open to explore, right?

01:06:35.852 --> 01:06:36.454
Gabby!

01:06:36.454 --> 01:06:37.658
It's our wedding!

01:06:37.697 --> 01:06:38.581
Cup him.

01:06:38.581 --> 01:06:39.342
Suck him.

01:06:39.342 --> 01:06:39.865
No no no!

01:06:39.865 --> 01:06:41.148
You just rub it a bit and then….

01:06:41.148 --> 01:06:41.549
What the fuck?

01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.951
Gabby!

01:06:41.951 --> 01:06:43.035
Venture off a little more.

01:06:43.195 --> 01:06:44.158
Venture off?

01:06:44.238 --> 01:06:45.802
They swear they don't like it but...

01:06:45.081 --> 01:06:45.722
Shit!

01:06:46.486 --> 01:06:47.327
Really?

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.183
I'm happy.

01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:56.195
Janet's dope.

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:06.467
You're my brother and everything, but you're a piece of shit.

01:07:08.834 --> 01:07:09.676
Does she know that?

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:13.930
Yeah, she knows who I am.

01:07:17.983 --> 01:07:23.037
I mean, you can't get into something with somebody without ... She knows who I am.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.004
Yeah.

01:07:25.044 --> 01:07:25.565
I know who you are.

01:07:27.131 --> 01:07:27.733
You're a piece of shit.

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.105
If you break her heart, I'm going to fuck you up.

01:07:34.312 --> 01:07:35.396
Good to know.

01:07:45.868 --> 01:07:47.874
If anything happened to you, I would take care of your kids.

01:07:47.915 --> 01:07:49.560
If you had any.

01:07:51.004 --> 01:07:51.846
And I would take care of her.

01:07:54.976 --> 01:07:56.180
I would take care of Janet.

01:08:16.443 --> 01:08:17.163
What's in the stack?

01:08:17.205 --> 01:08:17.687
Anything good?

01:08:18.048 --> 01:08:21.337
Let's see here... Business dispute.

01:08:21.377 --> 01:08:22.381
Request police mediation.

01:08:22.421 --> 01:08:24.386
One neighbor threw a cup of water on the other neighbor's window.

01:08:24.428 --> 01:08:25.511
We're not buying that.

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:27.154
Three ninety male.

01:08:27.197 --> 01:08:28.600
Intoxicated person outside a liquor store.

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.964
Get the fuck out of here.

01:08:30.004 --> 01:08:32.211
There's a drunk man outside the liquor store?

01:08:34.058 --> 01:08:35.100
Welfare check.

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:37.466
Woman requests PD contact her elderly mother.

01:08:37.627 --> 01:08:38.310
Yeah, buy that one.

01:08:38.712 --> 01:08:39.233
You serious?

01:08:39.274 --> 01:08:41.800
Yeah, if we buy a couple of these, maybe they'll send us a code three call.

01:08:42.563 --> 01:08:43.005
Cool.

01:08:43.005 --> 01:08:44.970
I'll hit her up for the next hotshots.

01:08:45.011 --> 01:08:46.895
On this episode, we're rolling to a call.

01:08:46.895 --> 01:08:50.107
A woman called the station to check on her elderly mother.

01:08:50.107 --> 01:08:51.109
So we're going to go.

01:08:52.112 --> 01:08:53.756
These are the calls most agencies deal with, you know?

01:08:53.798 --> 01:08:56.125
Not every call's a foot pursuit or a car chase.

01:08:56.165 --> 01:08:59.535
Some guys at other agencies have never even drawn their weapon or been in a gunfight.

01:08:59.575 --> 01:09:01.220
Yeah, but here that's just half your shift.

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:02.144
In the south end...

01:09:02.184 --> 01:09:06.636
we'll get involved in more capers in one deployment period than most cops see their entire career.

01:09:06.678 --> 01:09:07.600
Hell yeah.

01:09:11.011 --> 01:09:12.456
Mrs. Williams!

01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:18.354
Mrs.Williams!

01:09:18.393 --> 01:09:19.676
Police Officers!

01:09:20.921 --> 01:09:21.764
Go around back, check it out.

01:09:21.764 --> 01:09:22.446
All right.

01:09:22.446 --> 01:09:23.008
Here we go.

01:09:24.893 --> 01:09:25.777
I'm going to wait for my partner.

01:09:25.816 --> 01:09:28.786
He's going to check the back to see if she's around the back over there.

01:09:28.826 --> 01:09:31.795
Often times, a lot of these people, they're very old people.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:33.118
They can't hear us.

01:09:33.158 --> 01:09:37.212
You know, they can't hear – the hearing aids, you know.

01:09:37.894 --> 01:09:38.335
Nothing.

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:42.148
So the owner of this house is actually the daughter of the woman who lives in it.

01:09:42.185 --> 01:09:47.363
She gave us permission for the welfare check, so we're going to... We're going to boot the door.

01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:51.777
Officer Zavala specializes in booting doors.

01:09:51.817 --> 01:09:52.979
I kick doors down.

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:53.903
There you go.

01:09:53.943 --> 01:09:55.107
I kick doors down.

01:09:56.472 --> 01:09:57.755
Say it in English now.

01:09:57.796 --> 01:09:59.119
I kick doors down.

01:09:59.159 --> 01:10:00.564
Wait, did you check if it was unlocked?

01:10:01.888 --> 01:10:06.582
Ladies and gentlemen, always a good idea to make sure a door is locked ... before you boot it.

01:10:06.904 --> 01:10:07.666
Are you going to cut that out?

01:10:07.706 --> 01:10:08.589
Yeah, sorry.

01:10:08.629 --> 01:10:09.913
It was always locked.

01:10:09.953 --> 01:10:11.077
Clearly my partner always knew that.

01:10:11.116 --> 01:10:13.524
You know what's going to happen, right?

01:10:13.563 --> 01:10:13.925
What?

01:10:14.527 --> 01:10:17.415
She's going to roll through, come from the church or the store or whatever.

01:10:18.138 --> 01:10:20.304
And then she's going to see property damage and what's going to happen?

01:10:20.345 --> 01:10:20.707
What's going to happen?

01:10:20.746 --> 01:10:22.190
We're going to be the bad guys.

01:10:25.601 --> 01:10:26.284
Shit.

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.811
We got a dead body.

01:10:43.295 --> 01:10:43.777
What have we got?

01:10:43.818 --> 01:10:44.339
Squatters?

01:10:44.339 --> 01:10:45.944
Yeah, I'd say someone's been kicking it back here for sure.

01:10:48.071 --> 01:10:49.073
LAPD

01:10:49.113 --> 01:10:50.358
Let's roll through.

01:11:05.724 --> 01:11:06.247
You good?

01:11:06.247 --> 01:11:06.728
Clear.

01:11:14.512 --> 01:11:15.154
That is wrong.

01:11:15.195 --> 01:11:15.916
I said it was clear.

01:11:15.956 --> 01:11:16.358
All right.

01:11:16.398 --> 01:11:17.561
I'm just filming it.

01:11:31.444 --> 01:11:32.046
I found her.

01:11:32.046 --> 01:11:32.808
What's up?

01:11:45.126 --> 01:11:48.496
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen, I'm going to need a supervisor and two additional units at our location.

01:11:48.537 --> 01:11:52.549
And RA for the elderly female approximately seventy years old.

01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:55.599
Not conscious, not breathing.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.491
Thirteen x thirteen's requesting two additional units and a supervisor.

01:11:59.530 --> 01:12:00.856
Five one seven one Maple.

01:12:00.856 --> 01:12:03.625
Incident one four six seven, RA thirteen fifty-   one.

01:12:03.664 --> 01:12:06.391
What is she, grandma praying to the dope gods or some shit?

01:12:06.793 --> 01:12:08.077
That's not fucking grandma.

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:15.300
Don't fucking play on them.

01:12:15.339 --> 01:12:15.942
No, look.

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:17.265
Hollow.

01:12:17.305 --> 01:12:18.389
Somebody's opened it before.

01:12:18.429 --> 01:12:19.554
That's what that means.

01:12:21.799 --> 01:12:22.482
Take that shit out.

01:12:22.482 --> 01:12:24.208
You can't pull it out yourself?

01:12:24.248 --> 01:12:25.170
Just fucking pull it out.

01:12:37.689 --> 01:12:38.170
Party time.

01:12:40.657 --> 01:12:47.037
Z... No, wait wait wait.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:48.322
What?

01:12:48.362 --> 01:12:49.004
Do you see that pot?

01:12:49.044 --> 01:12:50.128
Yeah.

01:12:52.133 --> 01:12:53.056
That shit's still steaming.

01:12:53.056 --> 01:12:53.738
Oh shit.

01:12:53.778 --> 01:12:54.420
I'm going in.

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:55.103
Ready?

01:12:55.103 --> 01:12:55.423
Go ahead.

01:13:12.878 --> 01:13:13.640
What is that?

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.081
Is that a body?

01:13:14.121 --> 01:13:16.569
Yeah, there's bodies in there.

01:13:16.609 --> 01:13:18.014
Thanks for the fucking update.

01:13:20.821 --> 01:13:21.664
Fuck.

01:13:21.705 --> 01:13:23.551
Is it clear?

01:13:24.835 --> 01:13:25.355
Clear.

01:13:26.841 --> 01:13:27.523
What does it say?

01:13:27.562 --> 01:13:29.168
What's that shit say?

01:13:29.207 --> 01:13:30.371
Keep bringing them.

01:13:30.412 --> 01:13:31.856
Ha ha ha.

01:13:36.471 --> 01:13:36.831
Fuck!

01:13:36.872 --> 01:13:37.273
Come on.

01:13:38.597 --> 01:13:39.439
Get your shit together.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.443
Pull your shit together.

01:13:48.588 --> 01:13:49.471
Fuck out of here.

01:13:49.511 --> 01:13:50.834
Let's get out of here.

01:13:53.964 --> 01:13:54.405
Fuck.

01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:56.652
Sick motherfuckers.

01:13:56.693 --> 01:13:57.856
Who would do shit like that?

01:14:12.542 --> 01:14:13.184
What is that shit?

01:14:14.107 --> 01:14:14.909
I don't fucking know.

01:14:16.032 --> 01:14:17.236
I've never seen that kind of shit.

01:14:20.205 --> 01:14:21.970
Do you have hand sanitizer?

01:14:22.011 --> 01:14:22.814
No, I don't.

01:14:23.455 --> 01:14:28.471
I'm Serene Branson on the scene in south Los Angeles at one of the largest narcotics seizures this year.

01:14:28.511 --> 01:14:32.684
In addition to the drugs, officials are telling us there was a very gruesome discovery.

01:14:32.724 --> 01:14:35.935
An unknown number of bodies showing evidence of torture.

01:14:35.974 --> 01:14:42.514
A police official familiar with the investigation denied rumors Mexican drug cartels are responsible for the murders.

01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:49.135
We're having a lot of problems.

01:14:49.175 --> 01:14:51.822
The Lord of the South wants something done.

01:14:51.864 --> 01:14:55.956
This is just two city cops, right?

01:14:55.996 --> 01:14:57.120
Yes, two city cops.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.484
Take care of these assholes or I'll take care of you.

01:14:58.484 --> 01:15:01.934
Got a problem with that?

01:15:01.974 --> 01:15:03.580
Consider it done.

01:15:05.225 --> 01:15:06.909
And don't leave a mess.

01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:10.360
People hate cops, people in gangs.

01:15:12.487 --> 01:15:15.496
Write down what you spend. I'll get it done.

01:15:30.702 --> 01:15:33.471
Gabby wants to know if you and Janet want to roll to the Dodgers game with us tonight.

01:15:33.511 --> 01:15:35.759
We're going to Santa Barbara.

01:15:35.798 --> 01:15:38.727
All right, fuck you then, I'll sell that shit online or something.

01:15:41.818 --> 01:15:42.819
Here's Tre right here.

01:15:44.025 --> 01:15:44.546
What's up, Tre?

01:15:45.549 --> 01:15:46.190
What's up back.

01:15:48.317 --> 01:15:48.999
What you doing?

01:15:50.163 --> 01:15:51.887
I'm doing what I do, you know what I'm saying?

01:15:51.928 --> 01:15:52.651
Same shit, different day.

01:15:53.051 --> 01:15:54.015
Ain't shit changed.

01:15:54.055 --> 01:15:55.018
What's up with you all?

01:15:56.222 --> 01:15:56.904
Just slow motion.

01:15:56.904 --> 01:15:58.589
And that little incident you and I had?

01:15:59.271 --> 01:16:00.154
You kept it G.

01:16:01.438 --> 01:16:02.079
You didn't snitch on me.

01:16:02.079 --> 01:16:03.123
And I respect that.

01:16:04.046 --> 01:16:07.215
So check this out, my people just got out of Folsom prison.

01:16:07.215 --> 01:16:07.857
From up north.

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:08.499
Oh yeah?

01:16:08.499 --> 01:16:09.904
Word is you got a hit on you all.

01:16:09.944 --> 01:16:11.027
You all been greenlit.

01:16:11.027 --> 01:16:13.234
We're cops, everybody wants to kill us.

01:16:13.234 --> 01:16:15.040
I'm just telling you what they're saying.

01:16:15.722 --> 01:16:20.497
No, you know what, we appreciate the info, but this don't mean you get a pass if we catch you slipping.

01:16:20.497 --> 01:16:21.941
I ain't looking for no fucking pass.

01:16:21.981 --> 01:16:23.546
I do what I do, you know what I'm saying?

01:16:24.028 --> 01:16:25.472
I had to say it, though, you know how it is.

01:16:25.994 --> 01:16:27.479
All right, what you doing this weekend?

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:28.521
You like the Dodgers?

01:16:28.521 --> 01:16:30.046
You going to slide a nigger some tickets or something?

01:16:30.408 --> 01:16:31.210
You like the Dodgers?

01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:31.971
Have a good weekend.

01:16:32.013 --> 01:16:32.575
Slide me some tickets.

01:16:32.613 --> 01:16:34.660
Shut the fuck up!

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:44.972
Did you fuck with my... come on, did you fuck with my shit?

01:16:45.012 --> 01:16:46.778
I don't fuck with your shit.

01:16:48.263 --> 01:16:49.386
Mike, come on.

01:16:49.426 --> 01:16:50.750
Don't be a little bitch about it.

01:16:50.789 --> 01:16:52.033
I didn't fuck with your shit.

01:16:52.073 --> 01:16:53.037
You fucked with my shit.

01:16:53.077 --> 01:16:54.280
It was in totally different order.

01:16:54.322 --> 01:16:56.087
Why do you have an investigation report on here?

01:16:56.127 --> 01:16:58.374
I don't have an investigation report on there.

01:16:58.414 --> 01:16:59.256
It's your handwriting.

01:16:59.256 --> 01:16:59.658
Don't be an idiot.

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:00.741
All this is fucked up.

01:17:00.781 --> 01:17:02.145
Did you drop it or something?

01:17:02.185 --> 01:17:03.951
There's three types of pages.

01:17:04.914 --> 01:17:06.117
It's all out of order.

01:17:06.158 --> 01:17:07.602
It's all fucking out of order.

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:09.367
No, it's a pain in the ass.

01:17:09.408 --> 01:17:10.130
I'm sorry, partner.

01:17:13.982 --> 01:17:15.425
Wait until they hit a small street.

01:17:16.068 --> 01:17:18.876
At a stop sign, you fucking tap the bumper, we're going to get out and blast.

01:17:18.876 --> 01:17:19.478
Fuck no.

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:20.683
What do you mean, no?

01:17:20.723 --> 01:17:23.130
We should get them when they go to lunch at the Chinese place.

01:17:23.170 --> 01:17:24.856
That Chinese place is crawling with cops.

01:17:24.895 --> 01:17:26.501
We gotta get these fuckers when they're alone.

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:28.787
We can fucking follow their asses home and hit them there.

01:17:28.828 --> 01:17:32.639
White boy's in fucking Simi Valley and the other fucking fool's in San Gabriel.

01:17:32.639 --> 01:17:34.003
We gotta get these fuckers at the same time.

01:17:34.044 --> 01:17:35.849
This is the one-time, homie.

01:17:35.890 --> 01:17:37.173
Not a bunch of fucking niggers.

01:17:36.732 --> 01:17:37.734
Motherfucker.

01:17:37.775 --> 01:17:39.339
This fucker is straight from the fucking SHU.

01:17:39.339 --> 01:17:40.664
You stop fucking around.

01:17:40.705 --> 01:17:41.426
You got in the fucking car.

01:17:41.467 --> 01:17:46.201
You want to fucking hang with the fucking carnales... now you fucking pay the fucking price of fucking admission, homeboy.

01:17:46.201 --> 01:17:48.208
I'll fucking kill this fucking bitch, all right?

01:17:48.248 --> 01:17:49.451
You shut the fuck up.

01:17:49.492 --> 01:17:52.460
You get that fucking shit out of my fucking face.

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:53.584
I'll fucking kill you, motherfucker.

01:17:53.584 --> 01:17:54.667
Don't you fucking disrespect.

01:17:49.933 --> 01:17:50.615
Don't worry.

01:17:50.655 --> 01:17:51.537
I got this shit.

01:17:51.579 --> 01:17:52.139
Fuck.

01:17:55.951 --> 01:17:57.716
I don't know where the fucking rubber band is either.

01:17:57.757 --> 01:17:59.242
Don't blame me for the rubber band.

01:17:59.282 --> 01:18:00.565
You just took the rubber band off.

01:18:00.605 --> 01:18:05.259
If you hadn't fucking put everything out of order, then the rubber band wouldn't be out and the... Look, it's the butterfly effect, ok?

01:18:05.259 --> 01:18:07.146
Do you know what the butterfly effect is?

01:18:07.146 --> 01:18:08.028
Nope.

01:18:08.069 --> 01:18:09.071
It's the butterfly effect.

01:18:09.112 --> 01:18:10.315
Look it up.

01:18:10.355 --> 01:18:12.802
Just because you say it twice doesn't mean that I get it the second time.

01:18:12.844 --> 01:18:13.526
Look it up.

01:18:15.531 --> 01:18:16.615
This is fucking stupid.

01:18:16.615 --> 01:18:18.380
Those motherfuckers got bulletproof vests.

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:19.905
We need to hit them with some AKs and shit.

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:20.627
Don't fucking rank out.

01:18:20.627 --> 01:18:21.510
Fuck you!

01:18:22.473 --> 01:18:24.559
When the fuck have I ever backed out from shit?

01:18:25.643 --> 01:18:26.966
Get that fucking camera out of my face.

01:18:27.007 --> 01:18:30.537
I'm saying we just can't fuck this shit up.

01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:32.464
I don't give a fuck.

01:18:32.504 --> 01:18:33.748
You know me.

01:18:33.788 --> 01:18:35.352
I'll do the motherfucking time.

01:18:35.393 --> 01:18:38.082
I just don't want the big homies fucking whacking me.

01:18:38.723 --> 01:18:41.371
Fucking whacking me for fucking up.

01:18:42.576 --> 01:18:43.578
We need a fucking plan.

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:44.943
And you fucking know it.

01:18:45.785 --> 01:18:46.588
Think about it.

01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:48.794
That's all I'm saying.

01:18:54.091 --> 01:18:54.893
Fucking head back.

01:18:56.136 --> 01:18:58.183
I'll get some fucking big guns from the Border Brothers.

01:19:06.529 --> 01:19:08.455
Never fall asleep in a room full of cops.

01:19:13.832 --> 01:19:15.316
That shit ain't even fucking funny.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:20.011
Just cause you won the fucking award doesn't give you license to be a fucking asshole.

01:19:20.051 --> 01:19:21.014
You got shit on your face.

01:19:22.298 --> 01:19:23.301
What is this?

01:19:23.341 --> 01:19:25.026
Are we in the third fucking grade?

01:19:25.066 --> 01:19:27.875
Keep it up, it's going to earn you a risk management case.

01:19:27.915 --> 01:19:28.877
Give me this fucking camera.

01:19:28.917 --> 01:19:29.881
He had something....

01:19:29.921 --> 01:19:30.764
I'm serious.

01:19:30.764 --> 01:19:33.252
This department built you up, they will fucking tear you down.

01:19:33.411 --> 01:19:34.535
You know it's fucking funny.

01:19:34.535 --> 01:19:35.900
Laugh, you fucking idiot.

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:37.745
Who left their shaving cream on the table?

01:19:44.165 --> 01:19:45.248
How was Santa Barbara?

01:19:48.258 --> 01:19:48.941
Awesome.

01:19:53.875 --> 01:19:54.918
Janet's pregnant.

01:19:54.959 --> 01:19:56.484
What?

01:19:56.523 --> 01:19:58.209
Get out of here.

01:19:58.209 --> 01:19:59.292
Are you serious?

01:19:59.332 --> 01:20:00.416
Already?

01:20:00.456 --> 01:20:01.980
She's not even Mexican.

01:20:02.019 --> 01:20:06.594
Yeah, she's going for the ultrasound tomorrow, but three of those little piss stick things...

01:20:06.594 --> 01:20:08.721
Positive, positive, positive.

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.928
Whoa, congrats.

01:20:15.181 --> 01:20:16.384
That's when we fucking graduate.

01:20:16.384 --> 01:20:17.989
We fucking get the upgrade right now.

01:20:18.111 --> 01:20:20.718
Not fucking going to be little fucking paisas no fucking more.

01:20:20.718 --> 01:20:21.079
Right?

01:20:21.079 --> 01:20:21.560
Yeah.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.563
That’s what we’re going to fucking do.

01:20:22.683 --> 01:20:23.205
OK?

01:20:23.847 --> 01:20:26.496
They want to come into our fucking hood and fucking talk shit to us?

01:20:26.496 --> 01:20:27.299
You fucking do this shit right?

01:20:27.299 --> 01:20:30.067
They don’t fucking disrespect us. It’s our fucking hood.

01:20:29.104 --> 01:20:30.629
You guys want to fucking collect?

01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:31.832
You guys got to fucking put up.

01:20:31.873 --> 01:20:32.915
This time we’re going to fucking do it right.

01:20:32.915 --> 01:20:33.639
Hell yeah, we’re doing this.

01:20:33.678 --> 01:20:35.042
Fucking guys have some fucking balls.

01:20:35.604 --> 01:20:42.745
After we get these motherfuckers... you know it’s gonna be a little hot in the hood.

01:20:42.745 --> 01:20:45.756
We’re going to get the fuck out of here after that.

01:20:45.756 --> 01:20:47.963
I’m gonna fucking take you guys to fucking Vegas.

01:20:48.002 --> 01:20:50.570
You guys fucking do this shit right, I’m gonna treat you right.

01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:54.301

01:35:29.001 --> 01:35:29.844
She’s not dating anyone.

01:35:29.884 --> 01:35:30.406
OK.

01:35:30.406 --> 01:35:31.288
Ever.

01:35:31.328 --> 01:35:32.653
All right.

01:35:34.578 --> 01:35:37.346
Did I ever tell you about the first time I spent the night with Gabby?

01:35:37.387 --> 01:35:38.792
I don’t want to hear that.

01:35:39.433 --> 01:35:40.958
I got a hella big family, right?

01:35:40.999 --> 01:35:43.164
Fuck, I don’t want to hear that.

01:35:43.206 --> 01:35:43.888
I got a hella big family.

01:35:43.928 --> 01:35:46.013
Someone’s always at my house.

01:35:46.053 --> 01:35:50.267
But one time, Gabby’s parents bounced to Ensenada and her brother crashed at his girlfriend’s so I spent the night at her house.

01:35:51.149 --> 01:35:52.514
And this was going to be the night.

01:35:53.396 --> 01:35:55.723
It was going to be the night, you know what I’m saying?

01:35:55.765 --> 01:35:57.489
No, what are you talking about?

01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:58.172
Well I’ll tell you what I’m talking about.

01:35:58.172 --> 01:35:58.894
OK cool

01:35:58.894 --> 01:36:01.823
So we’re in her parents’ bed, right?

01:36:01.862 --> 01:36:02.344
And it’s on.

01:36:02.384 --> 01:36:03.267
It’s about to go down.

01:36:03.708 --> 01:36:05.153
I’m taking off her chones, I’m taking off--

01:36:05.153 --> 01:36:05.394
Chones?

01:36:05.433 --> 01:36:07.360
Her skivvies, come on.

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.443
Right.

01:36:08.483 --> 01:36:09.887
And I’m like finally, right?

01:36:09.928 --> 01:36:10.731
Fucking finally.

01:36:10.770 --> 01:36:12.455
But then we hear this noise.

01:36:12.496 --> 01:36:13.819
Someone’s in the pad.

01:36:14.221 --> 01:36:15.946
So I hide underneath the bed.

01:36:15.987 --> 01:36:17.471
And then I hear people coming up.

01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:18.634
And it’s her parents.

01:36:20.039 --> 01:36:20.801
This is the second floor.

01:36:20.841 --> 01:36:21.844
What?

01:36:21.885 --> 01:36:22.767
I got nowhere to go.

01:36:22.767 --> 01:36:25.215
Homegirl’s trying to distract them, but it ain’t happening.

01:36:25.255 --> 01:36:26.738
And the footsteps grow louder.

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:28.344
Louder and louder.

01:36:28.384 --> 01:36:32.196
Then the door opens – oh my god, I’m naked... underneath the bed.

01:36:32.236 --> 01:36:34.564
And then all I can seeis little footsteps.

01:36:34.603 --> 01:36:39.299
I see his hairy feet and I see her nails all painted and they’re yapping, they’re doing their thing.

01:36:39.299 --> 01:36:40.221
And they crash.

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:46.802
And this is the part I never told Gabby... I hear a little smootchie smootch, and I hear some shit, and I’m praying, please no.

01:36:47.684 --> 01:36:48.647
And they did it.

01:36:48.687 --> 01:36:49.811
What? ... What?

01:36:50.091 --> 01:36:51.175
They got down!

01:36:51.898 --> 01:36:54.345
I’m talking Gabby’s parents fucking!

01:36:54.384 --> 01:36:55.749
All right, I got it.

01:36:55.789 --> 01:36:56.151
No!

01:36:56.190 --> 01:36:58.437
The shit was so traumatic.

01:36:59.279 --> 01:37:02.570
It must have been a little uncomfortable around the folks after that.

01:37:03.693 --> 01:37:06.181
Yeah, because her father’s a freak.

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.913
I guess when you’ve been married that long, you gotta mix it up a little bit.

01:37:09.952 --> 01:37:13.965
I tried rolling like that with Gabby and she was like hell no, you’re not touching me there.

01:37:16.894 --> 01:37:18.339
It makes me fucking uncomfortable.

01:37:18.339 --> 01:37:19.943
I know, you know why?

01:37:19.984 --> 01:37:20.946
Because you’re a freak too.

01:37:20.946 --> 01:37:23.193
Don’t go there, just don’t go there.

01:37:23.234 --> 01:37:25.601
I fucking can’t breathe.

01:37:26.524 --> 01:37:27.528
Holy shit.
