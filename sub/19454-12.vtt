Previously on

00:03.738 --> 00:04.470
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>

00:04.472 --> 00:06.338
<i>The house of RuPaul is throwing</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:11.043
<i>the first-ever glitter ball.</i>

00:11.045 --> 00:12.411
<i> I just get really, like,</i>

00:12.413 --> 00:13.379
<i>discouraged and, like,</i>

00:13.381 --> 00:15.147
<i>frustrated.</i>

00:15.149 --> 00:19.985
<i> Why is it you haven't won</i>
<i>more challenges?</i>
<i> Now I'm starting all over.</i>

00:19.987 --> 00:23.088
<i>I'm fucked.</i>
<i>[Cries]</i>
<i> I don't believe that you're</i>

00:23.090 --> 00:26.592
<i>gonna run any business</i>
<i>dressed like that.</i>
<i>It was a cocktail dress.</i>

00:26.594 --> 00:29.995
<i> Adore Delano,</i>
<i>condragulations.</i>
<i>You're the winner of this</i>

00:29.997 --> 00:34.066
<i>week's challenge.</i>
<i> Oh, my God.</i>
<i> Darienne Lake,</i>

00:34.068 --> 00:39.505
<i>shante, you stay.</i>
<i>De LA, sashay away.</i>

00:39.507 --> 00:47.012
<i> [Sighs]</i>

00:47.014 --> 00:48.147
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

00:48.149 --> 00:50.049
<i>Ooh.</i>

00:50.051 --> 00:53.385
<i> What the fuck is that</i>
<i>on the mirror?</i>
<i> Oh, Jesus.</i>

00:53.387 --> 00:57.156
<i>Darienne's spelled incorrectly,</i>
<i>but that's all right.</i>
<i> "Darienne, I only harbor</i>

00:57.158 --> 01:00.759
<i>enough resentment..."</i>
<i> Both: "To write a long,</i>
<i>pointless message..."</i>

01:00.761 --> 01:04.963
<i> "That you'll have to clean</i>
<i>and clean and clean and clean."</i>

01:04.965 --> 01:05.631
<i> I'm definitely gonna</i>

01:05.633 --> 01:08.100
<i>miss de LA.</i>

01:08.102 --> 01:10.969
<i>[Whispering] No, I won't.</i>
<i>I won't.</i>
<i> Well, congratulations,</i>

01:10.971 --> 01:16.108
<i>miss Adore.</i>
<i>You won a sewing challenge.</i>
<i> Yeah, motherfucker, yeah.</i>

01:16.110 --> 01:17.543
<i> Are they seeing what</i>
<i>I'm seeing?</i>

01:17.545 --> 01:19.311
<i>She was just wearing a white</i>

01:19.313 --> 01:20.712
<i>tutu with a corset and some</i>

01:20.714 --> 01:22.081
<i>sparkles on it.</i>

01:22.083 --> 01:23.515
<i> You did great.</i>

01:23.517 --> 01:24.483
<i> Well, apparently Adore's</i>

01:24.485 --> 01:28.053
<i>the perfect banjee girl.</i>

01:28.055 --> 01:30.055
<i> Tonight Courtney kind of</i>

01:30.057 --> 01:31.990
<i>threw me under the mat.</i>

01:31.992 --> 01:36.995
<i> Over the last few weeks,</i>
<i>Adore kind of tripped and</i>
<i>stumbled, so I think that she</i>

01:36.997 --> 01:41.934
<i>would be the next one to go.</i>
<i> I really don't see the point</i>
<i>why Courtney threw my name</i>

01:41.936 --> 01:45.370
<i>out there.</i>
<i>The question was, "who do you</i>
<i>think should go home?"</i>

01:45.372 --> 01:49.208
<i>Not who you thought was</i>
<i>going to, but turned it</i>
<i>the fuck out.</i>

01:49.210 --> 01:52.411
<i> You don't know what the</i>
<i>judges are gonna think.</i>
<i> No, you really don't know.</i>

01:52.413 --> 01:56.415
<i>They want more, but then they</i>
<i>want--my ruffle's too big,</i>
<i>and my hat's too much.</i>

01:56.417 --> 02:02.588
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i> If I am brutally honest...</i>
<i> Sure, be brutally honest.</i>

02:02.590 --> 02:09.061
<i> I kind of was thinking that</i>
<i>you would turn out something</i>
<i>that we hadn't seen.</i>

02:09.063 --> 02:10.162
<i> Not today, Satan.</i>

02:10.164 --> 02:11.497
<i>Not today.</i>

02:11.499 --> 02:15.334
<i>Hey, I'm still here.</i>
<i>I'm grateful.</i>
<i> Bianca is a little rattled.</i>

02:15.336 --> 02:20.072
<i>Maybe we're starting to see</i>
<i>a couple of cracks in the wall.</i>
<i>I hope so.</i>

02:20.074 --> 02:25.544

02:25.546 --> 02:26.478
<i> </i> <i>RuPaul Drag Race</i>

02:26.480 --> 02:27.212
the winner of

02:27.214 --> 02:28.547
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i> receives a

02:28.549 --> 02:29.381
sickening supply of

02:29.383 --> 02:31.550
Colorevolution cosmetics and a

02:31.552 --> 02:34.520
cash prize of $100,000.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.921
<i>RuPaul Drag Race</i>

02:35.923 --> 02:37.322
may the best woman

02:37.324 --> 02:40.192
best woman win

02:40.194 --> 02:45.664
four.
Top four.
I'm so excited to be in

02:45.666 --> 02:49.234
the top four.
I'm so close to the finish line.
And you could grab it or it

02:49.236 --> 02:55.574
could just slip away, so I want
to grab it.
It's been a long journey.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.709
[Alarm blares]
[Screams]
Yay!

02:57.711 --> 03:04.116
Right when Courtney's talking.
Ooh, girl.
My top four, you've all come so

03:04.118 --> 03:09.555
far, and the only thing standing
between you and the crown
is you.

03:09.557 --> 03:15.060
So shoulders back, tits out,
and, girl, you better sissy
that walk.

03:15.062 --> 03:21.567
Yes!
Hello, hello, hello.
[All talking at once]

03:21.569 --> 03:25.571
It's me, Ben de LA creme.
I'm back.
[Laughter]

03:25.573 --> 03:30.576
You made it to the top four.
[All cheer]
Condragulations.

03:30.578 --> 03:36.615
For your final challenge, you'll
be starring in the music video
<i>sissy that walk.</i>

03:36.617 --> 03:42.120
<i>[All cheer]</i>
<i> It's a timeless tale of</i>
<i>an innocent girl who sells</i>

03:42.122 --> 03:47.960
<i>her soul to become sissy,</i>
<i>international supermodel</i>
<i>of the world.</i>

03:47.962 --> 03:52.064
<i> Oh.</i>
<i> You'll learn sissy-ography</i>
<i>with world-renowned</i>

03:52.066 --> 03:55.934
<i>choreographer Jamal sims.</i>
<i> Mm.</i>
<i> You'll also be starring in</i>

03:55.936 --> 04:02.874
<i>two acting scenes, where you'll</i>
<i>be improvising with RuPaul.</i>
<i>Oh, and I hope you're hungry,</i>

04:02.876 --> 04:07.846
<i>because you're each invited</i>
<i>to a little mother-daughter</i>
<i>lunch with mama Ru.</i>

04:07.848 --> 04:14.319
<i> All: Aww.</i>
<i> And in the end, one of you</i>
<i>will be eliminated.</i>

04:14.321 --> 04:19.524
<i> Oh, boy.</i>
<i> Uh, game changer.</i>
<i>We all thought no one else</i>

04:19.526 --> 04:24.730
<i>was going home, like in past</i>
<i>seasons, so, yeah,</i>
<i>it's very that.</i>

04:24.732 --> 04:29.935
<i> So don't fuck it up.</i>
<i> This is it.</i>
<i>We have to deliver, or we</i>

04:29.937 --> 04:35.207
<i>go home.</i>
<i> Gentlemen, start your</i>
<i>engines, and may the best woman</i>

04:35.209 --> 04:36.942
<i>win.</i>

04:36.944 --> 04:39.311
<i> Ladies.</i>

04:39.313 --> 04:44.449
<i> Hi.</i>
<i> Hi.</i>
<i> How you doing?</i>

04:44.451 --> 04:48.820
<i> Oh, how you doing?</i>
<i> You guys ready to learn</i>
<i>some sissy-ography?</i>

04:48.822 --> 04:50.856
<i> Yes.</i>
<i> I think so.</i>
<i> Come with me.</i>

04:50.858 --> 04:52.457
<i>Sissy-ography is about not being</i>

04:52.459 --> 04:54.326
<i>afraid to be sexy and hot</i>

04:54.328 --> 04:56.395
<i>and fun and sassy.</i>

04:56.397 --> 05:01.266
<i>I'm looking for them to give it.</i>
<i>Just watch me.</i>
<i>One, two, and three, four.</i>

05:01.268 --> 05:05.203
<i>Walk--bah, bah.</i>
<i>Hoo, click.</i>
<i> Well, that's easy.</i>

05:05.205 --> 05:10.475
<i> All right, here we go.</i>
<i>Adore, let's go.</i>
<i>Go, one, two, three, and four.</i>

05:10.477 --> 05:14.246
<i>Five, six, what?</i>
<i>Seven, eight.</i>
<i>Courtney, one, two,</i>

05:14.248 --> 05:18.950
<i>three, and four.</i>
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>
<i>Good.</i>

05:18.952 --> 05:22.587
<i>Bianca, here we go.</i>
<i> Just to let you know,</i>
<i>i had a stroke in 1972.</i>

05:22.589 --> 05:24.589
<i> You got this.</i>
<i>You got this.</i>
<i> All right.</i>

05:24.591 --> 05:27.959
<i> Come on with it.</i>
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>
<i>Go.</i>

05:27.961 --> 05:31.063
<i> Shit, I can't.</i>
<i>Am I going down, or am I--</i>
<i> look, you're gonna start with</i>

05:31.065 --> 05:35.567
<i>your chest, and then that rolls</i>
<i>down your body.</i>
<i>Let it--let it--yeah.</i>

05:35.569 --> 05:37.569
<i>You see that?</i>
<i>There you go.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

05:37.571 --> 05:40.238
<i>That's all right?</i>
<i>Keep going.</i>
<i>Come back to me.</i>

05:40.240 --> 05:42.274
<i>[Laughs]</i>
<i> But look, you can't be</i>
<i>smiling like this.</i>

05:42.276 --> 05:46.211
<i> It's that stroke.</i>
<i>It's that--you like this?</i>
<i>You like my roll?</i>

05:46.213 --> 05:51.616
<i> Bianca is struggling because</i>
<i>she's more worried about being</i>
<i>funny to deflect the fact that</i>

05:51.618 --> 05:56.421
<i>she's not being good.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> Miss Darienne, ready?</i>

05:56.423 --> 05:58.790
<i> Yep.</i>
<i> Let's go slow.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

05:58.792 --> 06:04.029
<i> So five, six, seven,</i>
<i>let's go.</i>
<i>Go, one, and two, three, four.</i>

06:04.031 --> 06:08.133
<i>Not right.</i>
<i>I see you thinking, and we have</i>
<i>to let that go.</i>

06:08.135 --> 06:14.139
<i>Now all together.</i>
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>
<i>And one, two, three, and four.</i>

06:14.141 --> 06:21.012
<i>Five, six, seven, eight.</i>
<i>One, two, and three, four.</i>
<i>Five, six, and seven, eight.</i>

06:21.014 --> 06:23.849
<i>What happened?</i>
<i> I don't know.</i>
<i>I just--I got lost on the first</i>

06:23.851 --> 06:28.186
<i>one, and I was like, "ooh, boy."</i>
<i> You're defeating yourself</i>
<i>before we even start.</i>

06:28.188 --> 06:33.592
<i>You can do this.</i>
<i> [Sighing] Oh, boy.</i>
<i> This is Ru's video, so</i>

06:33.594 --> 06:36.361
<i>we cannot fuck it up.</i>

06:36.363 --> 06:43.902
<i> Courtney Act, get your ass</i>
<i>in here.</i>
<i> Hi, RuPaul, how are you?</i>

06:43.904 --> 06:48.006
<i> I just didn't feel like</i>
<i>cooking, so I ordered in.</i>
<i> [Chuckles]</i>

06:48.008 --> 06:53.745
<i> So $100,000, America's next</i>
<i>drag superstar, why should you</i>
<i>get the crown?</i>

06:53.747 --> 06:56.548
<i> I can look good.</i>
<i>I can sing good.</i>
<i>I can dance good.</i>

06:56.550 --> 07:01.753
<i>And if there's somebody else</i>
<i>who's better than me, then they</i>
<i>should win, but I truly feel</i>

07:01.755 --> 07:06.591
<i>that I have been my best, and</i>
<i>i feel that I have been</i> <i>the</i> best
as well.

07:06.593 --> 07:11.797
You've been criticized for
resting on pretty and being
diplomatic in a way that felt

07:11.799 --> 07:17.736
sort of canned.
What about the emotional,
vulnerable side of Courtney Act?

07:17.738 --> 07:21.406
I know.
It concerns me that it seems
canned, 'cause I truly feel like

07:21.408 --> 07:25.610
I come from this place of
objectivity, and I feel like in
the competition as well, I'm

07:25.612 --> 07:28.480
in, like, work mode, and I'm
focused...
Right.

07:28.482 --> 07:33.585
On work.
We can all stand for a little
bit more humanity, even if that

07:33.587 --> 07:38.690
humanity seems messy and
uncomfortable.
I know that you have that

07:38.692 --> 07:42.461
vulnerability.
I can see it in your eyes.
And I'm very proud of you.

07:42.463 --> 07:46.398
Give 'em hell out there.
I will.
Thank you.

07:46.400 --> 07:55.273
So what are you, like,
the most worried about in
this challenge?

07:55.275 --> 07:58.844
I don't see the function
of worry.
I think it's all really fun.

07:58.846 --> 08:02.113
But, I mean, it's top four,
bitch.
Like, any type of, like, thing

08:02.115 --> 08:05.250
can happen that can, like, send
us home.
Well, you know, Ru said that

08:05.252 --> 08:09.588
sometimes when I talk, my
answers can sound canned, which
kind of came as a shock, because

08:09.590 --> 08:17.262
I feel like everything I say
kind of comes from the heart.
And I honestly don't know

08:17.264 --> 08:21.800
entirely what she means, so I
can't really--I'm not gonna blow
my head up thinking about it.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.869
I feel good.
I feel excited.
I'm happy.

08:23.871 --> 08:27.272
I'm doing a wig.
You think for a minute that
it's just a cakewalk.

08:27.274 --> 08:31.076
Look what happened to me
the last challenge.
I sew, and this bitch takes

08:31.078 --> 08:37.115
the cake.
All of us should be nervous.
Somebody's going home, and with

08:37.117 --> 08:41.586
that confidence, it might
be her.

08:41.588 --> 08:42.521
Coming up...

08:42.523 --> 08:43.188
Shit.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.089
She needs to impress

08:44.091 --> 08:45.657
the judges, and I don't know

08:45.659 --> 08:46.525
if she can.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.426
Fuck.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.595
[Laughing]

08:50.597 --> 08:56.535
[Laughing]

08:56.537 --> 09:02.507
Why, Darienne Lake.
Hi, Ru. Hello, gorgeous.
Get your tush in here, doll.

09:02.509 --> 09:06.912
So, Darienne, you're gonna
be famous.
How are you going to deal with

09:06.914 --> 09:11.349
people saying things,
mostly b.S.?
You know, I can brush off

09:11.351 --> 09:15.353
what people say to me, because
growing up, I heard
horrible things.

09:15.355 --> 09:21.526
You were thrown out of the
house as a kid, weren't you?
It wasn't, "pack your bags

09:21.528 --> 09:24.729
and leave."
It was more like an invitation
to leave.

09:24.731 --> 09:30.569
My mother said, "you have a lot
of nerve to stand there in my
house, on my dime, and live

09:30.571 --> 09:35.240
your lifestyle that I don't
approve of," and she's like,
"you're a clown.

09:35.242 --> 09:39.678
People are gonna laugh at you."
And I think she still has that
whole thing that queers are

09:39.680 --> 09:44.316
below any other person.
There was a lot of years of not
loving myself.

09:44.318 --> 09:50.355
Loving yourself--it really
takes a daily practice.
I'm so proud of you.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.456
There are things I'm getting

09:51.458 --> 09:52.824
from Ru that I don't get from

09:52.826 --> 09:54.826
my own mother.

09:54.828 --> 10:00.765
This experience has really
enriched the love of myself.
All right, sweetheart.

10:00.767 --> 10:07.405
Now get your ass back to work.
You've got a crown to win.
I'm trying to decide, for

10:07.407 --> 10:12.444
the final runway look, between,
like, this or to go for
something with a bit

10:12.446 --> 10:15.447
this is the final time we're

10:15.449 --> 10:16.281
gonna be walking down

10:16.283 --> 10:17.716
the runway, so I want to make

10:17.718 --> 10:19.784
sure that I'm glittery and

10:19.786 --> 10:20.852
fabulous.

10:20.854 --> 10:25.523
This is like a feather backpack
that's got, like, big pheasant
feathers coming out the back.

10:25.525 --> 10:30.829
Looks cute.
I have a hooded thing
as well.

10:30.831 --> 10:37.068
Oh.
That's pretty.
Maybe this is my opportunity

10:37.070 --> 10:44.142
to wear my Priscilla wig.
It's a little homage to
<i>Priscilla, queen of the desert.</i>

10:44.144 --> 10:45.343
<i> I may not have, like,</i>

10:45.345 --> 10:47.145
<i>expensive-ass gowns or</i>

10:47.147 --> 10:49.714
<i>accessories to the Max, but</i>

10:49.716 --> 10:51.249
<i>you don't need all of that</i>

10:51.251 --> 10:52.917
<i>to be a fucking star.</i>

10:52.919 --> 10:57.889
<i>Like, you can wear a paper bag,</i>
<i>and you could see out of the</i>
<i>crowd who is gonna be something</i>

10:57.891 --> 11:01.793
<i>or who is something already.</i>
<i> Do you know what you're gonna</i>
<i>wear yet?</i>

11:01.795 --> 11:07.866
<i> I'll wear something cute.</i>
<i> Adore reminds me of me ten</i>
<i>years ago.</i>

11:07.868 --> 11:12.137
<i>There was, like, a spark and</i>
<i>a talent there, but there wasn't</i>
<i>the refinement.</i>

11:12.139 --> 11:19.978
<i>She needs to impress the judges,</i>
<i>and I don't know if she can.</i>
<i> It's just $10 on ebay.</i>

11:19.980 --> 11:22.781
<i> Hello.</i>
<i> Hello.</i>
<i> Come on in.</i>

11:22.783 --> 11:25.350
<i> I feel like I'm at</i>
<i>the last supper.</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>

11:25.352 --> 11:28.319
<i> Well, here you are.</i>
<i>Top four.</i>
<i> I know.</i>

11:28.321 --> 11:32.424
<i> You're very astute.</i>
<i>You're one of the better players</i>
<i>we've had come through here.</i>

11:32.426 --> 11:36.127
<i>Where's that come from?</i>
<i> I've had some amazing people</i>
<i>in my life that have taught me</i>

11:36.129 --> 11:39.397
<i>that, you know, that were like,</i>
<i>"queen, you don't need to wear</i>
<i>that wig.</i>

11:39.399 --> 11:42.701
<i>You don't need to say that."</i>
<i>And now I catch myself on</i>
<i>countless occasions saying</i>

11:42.703 --> 11:47.305
<i>things to other queens that I'm</i>
<i>like, "I sound like the old one</i>
<i>now," you know?</i>

11:47.307 --> 11:50.909
<i> Now the rest of the world</i>
<i>will see that nicer side.</i>
<i>Are you prepared for that?</i>

11:50.911 --> 11:53.478
<i> You've been filming this?</i>
<i> [Laughing]</i>
<i> There's tape in</i>

11:53.480 --> 11:56.614
<i>those cameras?</i>
<i> [Laughing] Yeah.</i>
<i> Oh, great.</i>

11:56.616 --> 11:57.982
<i>Coming into this competition,</i>

11:57.984 --> 11:59.818
<i>i had no intentions of mentoring</i>

11:59.820 --> 12:01.252
<i>any child, but it's been kind of</i>

12:01.254 --> 12:02.754
<i>refreshing in a weird,</i>

12:02.756 --> 12:05.590
<i>fucked-up way.</i>

12:05.592 --> 12:08.927
<i> So, Adore, why should you</i>
<i>get the crown?</i>
<i> This is my passion.</i>

12:08.929 --> 12:13.198
<i>It's my calling.</i>
<i>I was raised right, so I would</i>
<i>not let you down.</i>

12:13.200 --> 12:16.901
<i> So, Adore, you're really</i>
<i>close to your mom.</i>
<i>You talk about her all the time.</i>

12:16.903 --> 12:20.772
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i>Like, my mom is all I need.</i>
<i>She's like my mom, my dad,</i>

12:20.774 --> 12:24.609
<i>my grandparents.</i>
<i>She's everything to me, so...</i>
<i> What about your dad?</i>

12:24.611 --> 12:29.514
<i> I don't really have</i>
<i>a relationship with him.</i>
<i> Do you want one?</i>

12:29.516 --> 12:32.984
<i>Why not?</i>
<i> There's a lot of things that</i>
<i>he said to me when I was</i>

12:32.986 --> 12:36.421
<i>younger.</i>
<i>When I was seven, he said that,</i>
<i>like, he was basically</i>

12:36.423 --> 12:40.692
<i>embarrassed at me because I was</i>
<i>feminine and I liked girl</i>
<i>things, and it just really</i>

12:40.694 --> 12:44.763
<i>stuck with me.</i>
<i>That, I think, has a lot to do</i>
<i>with my confidence.</i>

12:44.765 --> 12:49.234
<i>Like, a lot of my freak-outs,</i>
<i>a lot of my insecurities, do</i>
<i>come from that.</i>

12:49.236 --> 12:53.705
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i>A bone in the place it was</i>
<i>broken, after it heals, that</i>

12:53.707 --> 12:57.442
<i>becomes the strongest place</i>
<i>on the bone, you know what</i>
<i>I'm saying?</i>

12:57.444 --> 13:03.581
<i>So that broken place in you can</i>
<i>be your spiritual resurrection,</i>
<i>because you're a fabulous kid</i>

13:03.583 --> 13:09.087
<i>and you've got lots of talent,</i>
<i>and he's really missing out.</i>
<i>What's your mom's name?</i>

13:09.089 --> 13:13.057
<i> Bonnie.</i>
<i> Do this for Bonnie.</i>
<i>She's the one rooting for you</i>

13:13.059 --> 13:20.498
<i>back home, and you go out there,</i>
<i>and you don't let the saboteur</i>
<i>get you off the track.</i>

13:20.500 --> 13:28.873
<i> Now it's time to shoot our</i>
<i>dance routine for</i>
<i>sissy that walk</i> by RuPaul.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.477
I really want you to look like

13:32.479 --> 13:34.612

choreography right there.
All right, let's get the scruff

flashbacks.
Shit.

14:21.461 --> 14:26.397

<i> I was like,</i>
<i>"I'm the</i> <i>idol</i> drag queen,

23:42.288 --> 23:46.223
not you."
I kind of got that energy
from you in the beginning.

23:46.225 --> 23:51.262
But then, it was like, "ah,
actually I really like her."
Yeah, I'm fucking cool.

23:51.264 --> 23:55.466
Like, from my first
impression of everybody, I kind
of knew who Courtney Act was.

23:55.468 --> 23:59.470
"Kind of"?
Oh, I'm sorry.
But I know a lot of people

23:59.472 --> 24:02.473
were like, "oh, she's pretty.
She's probably a bitch in
real life," you know,

24:02.475 --> 24:04.875
that kind of thing.
My first impression of
Courtney?

24:04.877 --> 24:06.277
Beautiful, kind of talented,

24:06.279 --> 24:07.978
polished, and now she's like

24:07.980 --> 24:10.314
a true soul sister to me,

24:10.316 --> 24:11.415
even though she's a robot

24:11.417 --> 24:12.149
sometimes.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.286
You know, I thought,
"she seems sweet.
She seems nice."

24:15.288 --> 24:19.023
When I first met you,
I was afraid of you, because
you were very quick-witted,

24:19.025 --> 24:22.326
and I knew that you can shut
me down in seconds.
It's really surprising that

24:22.328 --> 24:26.430
Bianca and I get along,
because at first, she reminded
me of the girls back home that

24:26.432 --> 24:30.401
really don't like me.
I thought we were gonna fight,
but when I got to know you,

24:30.403 --> 24:35.339
the dynamic changed so much.
I feel like you brought
another side out of me.

24:35.341 --> 24:38.509
Now, Adore, the first day
that I met you, you were
standing next to Laganja,

24:38.511 --> 24:42.580
and I was like, "oh, fuck."
Then it clicked, and I was
like, "oh, she's fun.

24:42.582 --> 24:45.916
She's cool," 'cause you had
said something about hog body,
and I'm like, "I've got this

24:45.918 --> 24:48.886
extra corset.
Let me help this bitch out."
Oh, yeah.

24:48.888 --> 24:49.720
What I like most about

24:49.722 --> 24:50.955
Adore is that she's fearless

24:50.957 --> 24:52.857
and she's fun, and sometimes

24:52.859 --> 24:53.791
that's not really a part of

24:53.793 --> 24:54.859
my world.

24:54.861 --> 24:58.629
Had you been Laganja, you'd
have been fat the whole time.
I wouldn't have given it to her.

24:58.631 --> 25:03.167
I want Bianca to finish
a sentence without a joke.
Okay.

25:03.169 --> 25:06.637
Courtney is an asshole.
[Laughter]
I feel like there's an

25:06.639 --> 25:09.974
"uncomfortability" with
actually letting people know
that you're nice.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.977
I think that people all the
time spend too much energy
going, "I love you,"

25:12.979 --> 25:17.348
and that's just weird.
So I'd rather go, "I love you,
but your wig is horrible."

25:17.350 --> 25:21.018
Bianca is a formidable

25:21.020 --> 25:22.720
talent, but I think America's

25:22.722 --> 25:23.821
next drag superstar needs to

25:23.823 --> 25:27.525
have a compassion and a warmth,

25:27.527 --> 25:29.226
and I don't experience that

25:29.228 --> 25:29.894
in her.

25:29.896 --> 25:34.231
The scary part about this
whole thing is that we've come
all this way, and there's a huge

25:34.233 --> 25:37.535
chance that you don't make it.
It's that moment of like,
"shit."

25:37.537 --> 25:42.306
Yeah, it's like, "oh,
I finally got to Hawaii,
and then I fell in a volcano."

25:42.308 --> 25:47.177
Final runway, final critiques--
this is it.
This is the final game in

25:47.179 --> 25:50.347
the world series of drag.

25:50.349 --> 26:03.127
[Percussive electronic music]
[Laughing]

26:03.129 --> 26:11.168
Cover girl
put the bass in your walk
head to toe

26:11.170 --> 26:18.609
let your whole body talk
and what?

27:04.624 --> 27:08.492

27:14.600 --> 27:16.266
Next up, blame it on

27:16.268 --> 27:18.535
Bianca Del Rio.

27:18.537 --> 27:19.603
Wow.

27:19.605 --> 27:25.109
Lady sings the blues.
I'm serving up old Hollywood
glamour in my meridian blue

27:25.111 --> 27:30.014
satin bias gown.
I know Ru is loving my dress.
She got good taste.

27:30.016 --> 27:34.051
Yes, she's serving
bluefin tuna.
now sissy that walk

27:34.053 --> 27:38.322
next up, Courtney Act.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.958
L.G.D., little gold dress.

27:40.960 --> 27:45.129
"Charlie said I needed to
report to the main stage."
[Laughing]

27:45.131 --> 27:48.332
I decided to go with the
quintessential Courtney look.
It's glamorous.

27:48.334 --> 27:52.136
It's sexy.
I'm giving perfect, polished
Courtney.

27:52.138 --> 27:56.106
Eat your heart out,
Miranda lambert.
[Laughs]

27:56.108 --> 27:57.107
Now sissy that walk

27:57.109 --> 27:58.609
now let's take a dip in one

27:58.611 --> 28:00.878
of America's Great Lakes,

28:00.880 --> 28:02.146
Darienne.

28:02.148 --> 28:09.219
Devil in a blue dress.
Shake your shimmy, sister.
I am serving high drag diva.

28:09.221 --> 28:13.157
I'm feeling gorgeous.
I'm feeling sexy.
This is my absolute best,

28:13.159 --> 28:18.295
best dress.
Darienne Lake on the fringe.
now sissy that walk

28:18.297 --> 28:19.229
coming up...

28:19.231 --> 28:20.330
It's time for the judges'

28:20.332 --> 28:22.866
final critique...

28:22.868 --> 28:24.868
And one of you will be going

28:24.870 --> 28:28.706
home.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.774
[Laughing]

28:30.776 --> 28:35.145
[Laughing]

28:35.147 --> 28:37.014
Welcome, ladies.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.148
It's time for the judges'

28:38.150 --> 28:40.184
final critique.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.286
First up, Adore.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.921
I think this is a flattering

28:43.923 --> 28:45.355
dress for your shape.

28:45.357 --> 28:49.460
I think your face looks
really beautiful.
The hair tonight, I almost

28:49.462 --> 28:52.196
thought you were wearing
a headband when you
came out here.

28:52.198 --> 28:55.466
Oh.
The solo dancing,
that was really good.

28:55.468 --> 28:56.600
You put Adore into it,

28:56.602 --> 28:58.135
which I enjoyed.

28:58.137 --> 29:02.539
Believe it or not, acting,
too, was my favorite.
I was in a <i>novela</i> with you,

29:02.541 --> 29:05.542
but it was good acting.
[Laughs]
You sold me on it.

29:05.544 --> 29:09.780
Thank you, Adore.
Thank you, Ru.
Next up, blame it on

29:09.782 --> 29:13.250
Bianca Del Rio.
Tonight this color is
beautiful on you.

29:13.252 --> 29:17.254
Thanks.
As a group, you and
Courtney Act together really

29:17.256 --> 29:20.090
were in sync, and it looked
great.
Solo, I thought you did

29:20.092 --> 29:24.661
a good job as well.
It's fun to see you in
a sexy light.

29:24.663 --> 29:30.434
For your ingenue, your
expressions were so funny.
And the improv was

29:30.436 --> 29:34.905
phenomenal.
"It bears repeating."
It was very funny.

29:34.907 --> 29:40.978
Next up, Courtney Act.
Tonight you look flawless.
I don't think I'd change

29:40.980 --> 29:46.984
a thing.
[Laughter]
Yeah, really, just very,

29:46.986 --> 29:49.987
very happy.
You should be on the cover
of <i>playboy</i> magazine.

29:49.989 --> 29:54.391
You should have your own spread.
Let's do it.
As the ingenue, the slaps

29:54.393 --> 29:59.596
were really funny.
You went there.
As sissy with Charles,

29:59.598 --> 30:04.201
the props, like the glasses,
they kind of distracted from
your face.

30:04.203 --> 30:08.939
Group choreography,
you nailed it.
Love the wide shots, but

30:08.941 --> 30:15.445
the close-ups seemed so
frenetic and kind of too much.
All right, up next,

30:15.447 --> 30:20.918
Darienne Lake.
Tonight is just classic
Darienne, and it's so,

30:20.920 --> 30:26.423
so beautiful.
Your lip synching is so
major, and your piece as the

30:26.425 --> 30:32.329
ingenue, I could watch that on
repeat for hours.
I thought that was so funny.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.965
And then all of a sudden,
that second acting challenge
was kind of like this.

30:34.967 --> 30:38.101
Flatlined.
You didn't really get it going
till the end, but then when you

30:38.103 --> 30:42.940
did get it going,
you kept it going.
That was the magical part.

30:42.942 --> 30:49.813
All right, thanks, Darienne.
Ladies, final question--
why should you and not your

30:49.815 --> 30:57.321
competitors be crowned
America's next drag superstar?
Let's start with Adore.

30:57.323 --> 31:02.759
These girls up here are all
stars, but I'm really sorry
about it, I'm America's next

31:02.761 --> 31:06.830
drag superstar.
I feel like I'm relatable.
I'm approachable.

31:06.832 --> 31:11.935
And with this title, I will
be very proud to carry on
the legacy and teach all

31:11.937 --> 31:15.372
the little mermaids of
the world.
I just really, really want to

31:15.374 --> 31:20.143
make you proud.
I'm already a winner, but
the crown really would complete

31:20.145 --> 31:23.780
this whole look and everything.
[Laughing]
And I love you guys.

31:23.782 --> 31:28.518
Thank you.
Thank you, Adore.
Bianca Del Rio.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.122
There's an old saying that
you can't teach an old dog
new tricks.

31:32.124 --> 31:36.226
For me, it wasn't going through
the competition with
an adolescent charm,

31:36.228 --> 31:40.664
going through it with
a fabulous body and beauty,
or going through it with great

31:40.666 --> 31:45.202
lip-synch talents.
I had dresses, I had hair,
and a guard.

31:45.204 --> 31:50.040
I have built up this wall, and
this experience has changed me.
And I didn't expect it to be

31:50.042 --> 31:55.078
this magical or this inspiring,
but it is.
I went through a self-discovery,

31:55.080 --> 31:59.283
accepting that I'm not such
a bad bitch.
And I thank all of you

31:59.285 --> 32:04.021
personally from the bottom of
my chilly little heart.
Thanks.

32:04.023 --> 32:08.992
Thank you, Bianca.
Next up, Courtney Act.
Same question.

32:08.994 --> 32:13.263
In Australia,
I'm Australia's drag superstar.
And I've had so many wonderful

32:13.265 --> 32:17.234
opportunities there to have
a lot of good moments
and a lot of bad moments

32:17.236 --> 32:22.606
and learn from all of that.
And I sort of came to America
as, like, a polished product.

32:22.608 --> 32:25.742
And I feel that I can take
this, and I can make the most
out of it.

32:25.744 --> 32:30.447
You say this is the Olympics
of drag, and I want to take
that olympic torch, and I want

32:30.449 --> 32:35.953
to keep running with it,
and I want to be America's
next drag superstar.

32:35.955 --> 32:39.790
Thank you, Courtney.
Thank you.
Darienne Lake.

32:39.792 --> 32:44.528
I'm gonna give you more
queen per pound.
[Laughs]

32:44.530 --> 32:49.166
There's no comparing me
to others.
Adore, sometimes you get

32:49.168 --> 32:52.736
a little rattled.
Bianca, I could teach you
maybe a little thing

32:52.738 --> 32:58.942
about sensitivity.
Courtney, what a sexy dish, but
this dish needs a little salt.

32:58.944 --> 33:03.280
You have seen my talents.
I will make everyone who's
sitting there thinking that

33:03.282 --> 33:09.886
they're not good enough--
that if this old, bitter queen
can do it, anybody can do it.

33:09.888 --> 33:14.224
Thank you.
Thank you, Darienne.
Well, thank you, my queens.

33:14.226 --> 33:19.963
I think we've heard enough.
While you unwind in the
untucked lounge, the judges

33:19.965 --> 33:27.237
and I will deliberate.
All right, just between us
squirrels, what do we think?

33:27.239 --> 33:31.875
Let's start with Adore.
Adore is 23 years old,
and her speech on the main

33:31.877 --> 33:37.514
stage spoke like someone who's
23 years old.
I really feel like she was

33:37.516 --> 33:41.051
speaking from the heart,
and she got her point across.
Everybody loves me.

33:41.053 --> 33:45.389
Adore's acting was so
well done, I felt like it
was a real scene.

33:45.391 --> 33:50.093
She's a performer.
Adore is definitely a superstar.
She likes the sort of

33:50.095 --> 33:54.531
trashy-girl aesthetic.
But she's just so damn
charming that no matter what

33:54.533 --> 33:58.101
she does, I can't take my eyes
off of her.
Let's talk about

33:58.103 --> 34:03.707
Bianca Del Rio.
Her ingenue was funny,
and she brings her intelligence

34:03.709 --> 34:06.209
to the game.
It bears repeating.
It's hilarious.

34:06.211 --> 34:11.848
To me, Bianca comes off
as using comedy as a wall.
Her shtick is, "cold as ice.

34:11.850 --> 34:16.653
My heart is black."
Yeah, her humor can be
a little abrasive and dangerous.

34:16.655 --> 34:19.723
Is that the best choice for
the brand?
But that speech that she

34:19.725 --> 34:23.527
made was pretty amazing.
It's interesting just seeing
her vulnerability.

34:23.529 --> 34:29.499
And she had no problem helping
the other girls back in the
workroom, because she wasn't

34:29.501 --> 34:31.902
threatened by them.
No.
I would've liked to have

34:31.904 --> 34:35.072
had more variety in her runway
looks, though.
Let's move on to

34:35.074 --> 34:38.375
Courtney Act.
It's obvious the camera
loves her.

34:38.377 --> 34:41.111
Yes.
She has a presence.
She's beautiful.

34:41.113 --> 34:44.114
Her acting two challenge
was interesting.
She had all this shtick with

34:44.116 --> 34:48.985
the straw in her hair,
the glasses cockeyed.
Nothing was subtle about

34:48.987 --> 34:51.388
that performance.
It was overt.
But she did allude to

34:51.390 --> 34:54.491
the fact that she doesn't speak
with an Australian accent.
Which I appreciate.

34:54.493 --> 34:58.195
Which is super funny.
Now, let's talk about her
speech on the main stage.

34:58.197 --> 35:01.465
She's Australia's version
of RuPaul.
Right, that's not strong

35:01.467 --> 35:05.635
enough for me.
I wanted her to move me.
I don't get mad when people

35:05.637 --> 35:10.774
talk like that, especially
from Courtney Act, who I think
is an immense talent and who

35:10.776 --> 35:15.011
has consistently brought amazing
looks to the runway.
Let's move on to

35:15.013 --> 35:19.149
Darienne Lake.
The second acting challenge,
when she started to break down,

35:19.151 --> 35:21.952
then I got sucked in.
Her delivery...
Yeah.

35:21.954 --> 35:24.988
Was just hilarious,
just so funny.
And it even made Charles

35:24.990 --> 35:29.192
come back in and get her.
In the sissy-ography,
Darienne Lake got down with

35:29.194 --> 35:31.862
the get-down.
Thank you.
She's a fierce lip syncher.

35:31.864 --> 35:35.966
She is.
And, you know, all about
selling face constantly.

35:35.968 --> 35:39.569
In fact, she won the scream
queen challenge just because
of her head.

35:39.571 --> 35:42.672
I've won lots of stuff with
my head.
[Laughs]

35:42.674 --> 35:48.578
Silence.
Bring back my girls.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.881
[Laughing]

35:50.883 --> 35:55.018
[Laughing]

35:55.020 --> 36:01.224
Welcome back, ladies.
Now, before I can decide who
makes it to the top three,

36:01.226 --> 36:11.034
I need to see each of you
lip-synch for your life.
Four queens stand before me.

36:11.036 --> 36:20.710
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save
yourself from elimination.

36:20.712 --> 36:29.753
The time has come for you to
lip-synch...
For your life.

36:29.755 --> 36:33.423
All four of us have to

36:33.425 --> 36:34.724
lip-synch, and we're competing

36:34.726 --> 36:35.492
against each other.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.127
This is, like, a lip-synch

36:37.129 --> 36:38.562
death match.

36:38.564 --> 36:41.565
Good luck, and don't

36:41.567 --> 36:44.568
fuck it up.

36:44.570 --> 36:45.569
[Pulsing electronic music]

36:47.306 --> 36:52.509
pick myself up
turn the world on its head
don't forget what

36:52.511 --> 36:56.446
don't forget
what my mama said
people talking

36:56.448 --> 37:00.584
since the beginning of time
unless they're paying
your bills

37:00.586 --> 37:06.022
pay the bitches no mind
I've been training for this
moment my entire life.

37:06.024 --> 37:10.026
It's kind of odd being
Australian and being crowned
America's next drag superstar,

37:10.028 --> 37:13.863
but that's what America is
all about.
It's the great American dream.

37:13.865 --> 37:19.436
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
fly, fly, fly, fly

37:19.438 --> 37:24.007
uh-oh, uh-uh-oh
I have been on the bottom,
but it's not how many times

37:24.009 --> 37:28.011
you get kicked down.
It's how many times you
continue to get back up.

37:28.013 --> 37:34.351
I'm out there for the big girls.
I am a fighter.
now sissy that walk

37:34.353 --> 37:44.361
I think the reason why I'm
America's next drag superstar

37:44.363 --> 37:48.331
is because I'm a good
representation of the new girls
within the drag community.

37:48.333 --> 37:53.103
I have so much heart.
I have so much drive and fire.
I want people to know that you

37:53.105 --> 37:57.774
can follow your dreams and
have a party while doing it.
my pussy is on fire

37:57.776 --> 38:01.745
now kiss the flame
and if I fly
I should be America's next

38:01.747 --> 38:05.882
drag superstar because I've paid
my dues and shown myself
in this competition.

38:05.884 --> 38:10.787
I came, worked, I conquered,
and I'd like to share it with
the rest of the world.

38:10.789 --> 38:15.558
Fly, fly, fly, fly
uh-oh
now sissy that walk

38:15.560 --> 38:18.628
[laughing]

38:18.630 --> 38:25.435
Very nice.
Wow.
Ladies, you have not made it

38:25.437 --> 38:34.577
easy for me...
But I've made my decision.
[Suspenseful music]

38:42.654 --> 38:53.063
Darienne Lake, I'm sorry,
my dear, but you will not be
moving on to the top three.

38:53.065 --> 38:57.867
You know, I'm leaving here
without the crown
but not empty-handed.

38:57.869 --> 39:03.606
I have seriously grown,
and I have made friends for
a season, a reason,

39:03.608 --> 39:10.547
or a lifetime.
Thank you.
You are one resilient and

39:10.549 --> 39:17.921
gorgeous Glamazon.
It's time for everybody to jump
into the refreshing,

39:17.923 --> 39:24.027
unforgettable waters of
Darienne Lake.
Now...

39:24.029 --> 39:30.900
Sashay away.
And I will leave like
a true diva.

39:30.902 --> 39:34.637
Get out of my way.
Oh!
I've come this far,

39:34.639 --> 39:39.509
and to get so close,
it's like <i>the wizard of oz.</i>
<i>You get there, you've had to</i>

39:39.511 --> 39:47.384
<i>kill a witch or a couple of 'em,</i>
<i>and you get nothing at the end.</i>
<i> I present to the world my</i>

<i>All season long, I've consulted</i>

39:54.025 --> 39:58.695

<i>Who do you think should be</i>

39:58.697 --> 40:08.838

<i>Are you team Adore, team Bianca,</i>
<i>or team Courtney?</i>

40:08.840 --> 40:12.108
<i>Tweet your choice to...</i>

40:12.110 --> 40:14.778
<i>Using...</i>

40:48.680 --> 40:51.948
