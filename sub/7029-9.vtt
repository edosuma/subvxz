00:01.002 --> 00:02.868
Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:02.937 --> 00:04.453
The plan is: go in the water

00:04.572 --> 00:06.238
to find the anomalous stone.

00:06.290 --> 00:08.039
I swam that northerly bearing

00:08.125 --> 00:10.442
and I came across
another big triangle rock.

00:10.494 --> 00:12.778
Christopher Columbus
was responsible

00:12.830 --> 00:15.447
for the Ark
coming to Oak Island.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.549
-You good? Okay.
-Let's go!

00:17.651 --> 00:19.117
We're two dives away

00:19.220 --> 00:21.153
from getting answers
to a 40-year quest.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.088
-He's under.
-Finish 10-X.

00:23.174 --> 00:24.256
What's in the bottom?

00:24.308 --> 00:25.524
Michael, do you copy?

00:25.961 --> 00:27.360
Você pode me ouvir?

00:31.065 --> 00:33.982
There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.101 --> 00:36.018
where people have been looking

00:36.137 --> 00:39.705
for an incredible treasure
for more than 200 years.

00:39.774 --> 00:44.076
So far, they have found
bits of gold chain,

00:44.111 --> 00:48.197
a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it...

00:48.282 --> 00:51.483
even a 17th century
Spanish coin.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.486
To date, six men have died

00:54.588 --> 00:56.321
trying to solve the mystery.

00:56.424 --> 00:59.925
And, according to legend,

01:00.027 --> 01:02.327
one more will have to die

01:02.430 --> 01:05.129
before the treasure
can be found.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.146
It is the start of another

01:21.232 --> 01:23.415
challenging week on Oak Island.

01:23.517 --> 01:27.185
And brothers Rick and Marty
Lagina remain determined

01:27.238 --> 01:29.688
to reach this year's
biggest goal:

01:29.790 --> 01:34.243
to get a human being
to the bottom of Borehole 10-X.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.494
Okay.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.496
Time to talk to Harvey.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.415
After weeks of searching

01:40.501 --> 01:42.200
and several setbacks,

01:42.253 --> 01:45.888
they believe
they have finally found

01:45.973 --> 01:47.422
someone who is both qualified

01:47.508 --> 01:49.424
and courageous enough

01:49.510 --> 01:53.395
to attempt the perilous
235-foot dive.

01:53.514 --> 01:56.214
Now, have we decided
he's going to do it?

01:56.317 --> 01:58.233
Well, I think
he has to decide that.

01:59.687 --> 02:00.936
So, Harvey, good morning!

02:01.021 --> 02:02.321
-Morning.
-Morning.

02:02.406 --> 02:03.655
Morning, gentlemen.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.240
Wait, who are you talkin' to?

02:05.359 --> 02:08.577
Yeah, we use that,
that term very loosely.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.113
Harvey Morash

02:11.198 --> 02:13.081
is a certified deep wreck diver

02:13.167 --> 02:15.066
from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia

02:15.169 --> 02:18.036
who has nearly
25 years of experience

02:18.105 --> 02:21.206
exploring dangerous
and confined environments,

02:21.275 --> 02:24.676
from shipwrecks
to underwater cave systems.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.179
 Where are you at,
emotionally, on the thing?

02:27.264 --> 02:28.914
Um...

02:29.016 --> 02:31.216
it's definitely
very interesting.

02:31.268 --> 02:33.585
-Okay. -I mean,
who-who doesn't want to explore?

02:33.637 --> 02:35.270
-Yeah.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.922
Who doesn't want to go
on a treasure hunt?

02:36.974 --> 02:39.024
Well, to me,
it's not even about treasure,

02:39.059 --> 02:41.560
-it's just the exploration.
-Right.

02:41.612 --> 02:44.062
It's not so much the dive
as to deal with problems.

02:44.148 --> 02:46.315
-Right. -You know,
for technical diving, that's...

02:46.400 --> 02:48.534
that's the key, being able
to deal with a problem

02:48.619 --> 02:50.435
and keeping a cool head.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.954
-Yes.
-Right.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.622
Because the second you panic,

02:53.741 --> 02:55.407
it's-it's game over.

02:55.459 --> 02:57.543
You're going to make
a bad situation much worse.

02:57.628 --> 02:59.578
I think Harvey

02:59.630 --> 03:01.112
is a good candidate.

03:01.165 --> 03:02.614
He's a cave diver.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.583
This is very akin to a cave

03:04.635 --> 03:06.635
with a shaft going to it.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.221
You know,
so cave divers are used

03:09.256 --> 03:10.672
to being in closed spaces.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.641
They're used to visibility
being an issue.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.426
Coming up easy.

03:14.511 --> 03:16.511
Although the team has spent

03:16.597 --> 03:18.063
the last several weeks

03:18.148 --> 03:20.148
clearing debris and
obstructions from 10-X,

03:20.267 --> 03:24.152
all the way down
to the 181-foot level,

03:24.271 --> 03:28.640
Marty and Rick remain concerned
that an old drill bar

03:28.742 --> 03:31.643
that fell down 10-X
some 30 years ago

03:31.745 --> 03:33.662
is still wedged somewhere

03:33.747 --> 03:36.281
in the 27-inch portion
of the shaft.

03:36.367 --> 03:39.368
It could present
an insurmountable obstacle...

03:39.453 --> 03:41.837
especially if
Harvey is uncertain

03:41.956 --> 03:45.457
at exactly what depth
the drill bar is located.

03:45.542 --> 03:48.660
The exploration part would be

03:48.762 --> 03:50.545
to see or feel
the top end of the bar.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.047
-Yep. - The other thing
you'd want to do

03:52.132 --> 03:53.432
when you get on the bottom

03:53.467 --> 03:54.883
is give that pipe a good tug

03:54.969 --> 03:57.519
and push down on it and
everything before you go in it,

03:57.638 --> 03:59.605
because I wouldn't want to be
underneath it if it let go.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.773
That would make for
a very bad dive.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.175
Real bad.

04:04.278 --> 04:07.512
-It's either going to be
doable or not. -Yeah.

04:07.564 --> 04:10.315
If I could even get in
that, uh, restriction.

04:10.401 --> 04:11.650
You can get in.

04:11.735 --> 04:13.151
We know that's been done before,

04:13.203 --> 04:15.070
but Harvey uses tanks.

04:15.155 --> 04:18.240
If squeezing himself through

04:18.325 --> 04:21.709
the 27-inch wide portion of
10-X weren't difficult enough,

04:21.829 --> 04:23.528
Harvey will be attempting it

04:23.580 --> 04:26.081
while wearing two air tanks
on his back.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.467
I can't say how tight it is,

04:28.552 --> 04:30.419
but I'm assuming
a 27-inch hole...

04:30.504 --> 04:32.137
you don't have
a whole lot of room

04:32.222 --> 04:33.639
to deal with something, right?

04:33.724 --> 04:35.424
-Yep.
-From a logistical standpoint,

04:35.509 --> 04:39.210
I believe it makes
much more sense to do a test run

04:39.313 --> 04:41.730
of similar size
in 20 feet of water

04:41.849 --> 04:44.383
to make sure I can actually fit,

04:44.485 --> 04:47.019
as opposed to 181 feet.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.437
Well, we can lay it
down flat then,

04:48.522 --> 04:49.888
you can just swim...
swim right through it.

04:49.940 --> 04:51.890
-Yeah.
- That makes sense.

04:51.942 --> 04:53.241
And we want to do this
as safely as possible.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.826
Yes, I agree.

04:54.862 --> 04:58.063
If we set up the practice dive

04:58.165 --> 05:01.233
and it seems feasible
after that,

05:01.335 --> 05:02.751
then you are very interested
in doing this.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.419
Is that a fair statement?

05:04.505 --> 05:06.421
That is a fair statement.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.241
 So, Harvey,
we will rig up a pipe

05:10.344 --> 05:11.677
and call you back
with the details.

05:11.762 --> 05:13.244
We'll see you in a few days.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.047
Okay, looking forward to it.

05:15.132 --> 05:16.882
-Good enough. Thanks, Harvey.
-Thanks...

05:16.967 --> 05:18.216
-Thanks a lot.
Thank you. -Take care.

05:20.721 --> 05:21.970
There's no point
in this proceeding

05:22.056 --> 05:23.805
if he can't get
into the 27-inch shaft.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.224
Can he do it or can't he?

05:35.786 --> 05:37.235
Good morning.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.155
Here, skipper,
can you stow this?

05:40.240 --> 05:42.374
As Rick, Marty
and their partners

05:42.443 --> 05:44.960
wait for Harvey Morash
to arrive,

05:45.079 --> 05:46.828
they once again
turn their attention

05:46.914 --> 05:50.615
to the waters
surrounding Oak Island.

05:50.718 --> 05:53.468
Okay, good morning, folks.
Welcome back to Blue Phoenix.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.453
What we're going to do
is we're gonna head out

05:55.506 --> 05:57.589
and we're gonna look at
the triangle stone anomaly

05:57.674 --> 05:59.141
that we, uh, came across
the other day.

05:59.259 --> 06:02.511
-Let's get this show
on the road. -Yeah.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.480
Last week,
while the team collected

06:05.599 --> 06:07.149
side-scan sonar data

06:07.267 --> 06:09.467
some 300 feet off
the southern shore...

06:09.520 --> 06:11.520
That's interesting.
Look at the triangle.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.438
-See the triangle?
Oh, wow!

06:13.524 --> 06:15.774
...professional diver
and sonar expert Mike Roberts

06:15.859 --> 06:17.859
located what appears to be

06:17.945 --> 06:21.312
a mysterious
triangle-shaped object

06:21.365 --> 06:24.282
lying at a depth of
approximately 20 feet

06:24.334 --> 06:25.617
on the ocean floor.

06:25.702 --> 06:27.836
I don't think
Mother Nature made that.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.487
Wow.

06:29.540 --> 06:31.039
Now, Marty Lagina,

06:31.125 --> 06:33.375
his business partner,
Craig Tester,

06:33.460 --> 06:36.678
and their sons
Alex Lagina and Jack Begley

06:36.797 --> 06:38.997
have joined divers

06:39.099 --> 06:43.218
Tony Sampson, Mike Roberts,
Dave Delaney

06:43.303 --> 06:45.520
and marine archaeologist
Rod Peterson

06:45.639 --> 06:46.972
in an effort to find out

06:47.057 --> 06:49.357
if the strange,
three-sided object

06:49.476 --> 06:52.227
is, in fact, man-made.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.729
What a beautiful day, eh?

06:54.815 --> 06:57.899
It's flat-[bleep] calm.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.484
 Mike, if we can't find it
on a day like today,

06:59.536 --> 07:01.486
then we're not going to find it.

07:01.538 --> 07:03.989
I would say if we don't find it
now, it's going to be forever

07:04.074 --> 07:05.991
covered in silt,
and the next treasure hunters

07:06.076 --> 07:07.993
will maybe find it
in a thousand years.

07:10.664 --> 07:14.699
 Okay, we're going to come
around to starboard, guys.

07:14.751 --> 07:17.836
Beautiful, Jack.
Let's get it all the way, buddy.

07:17.921 --> 07:19.337
You ready?
- You're good!

07:19.389 --> 07:21.089
Yeah.

07:21.175 --> 07:24.309
"X" marks the spot, my friend.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.112
Okay.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.314
The arse end
of Blue Phoenix, here,

07:29.349 --> 07:30.816
is sitting right on
the "X" marks the spot.

07:30.901 --> 07:33.384
So the deal is, Rod,

07:33.487 --> 07:35.020
you're running the,
um, XO mask today.

07:35.105 --> 07:37.939
Mike's going to be, um,
your dive supervisor, there.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.591
-We got live comms.
-Yep.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.909
So, hopefully,
in a perfect world,

07:41.028 --> 07:43.111
you're going to jump over there,

07:43.197 --> 07:44.779
and you're gonna see
this beautiful triangle rock,

07:44.865 --> 07:46.615
glowing out of the seabed.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.999
Get the gear on, get in,

07:48.085 --> 07:49.668
let's go see what's there, eh?

07:49.753 --> 07:51.336
Go have a look.

07:54.625 --> 07:57.909
 The, uh, plan is for Rod,
the marine archaeologist,

07:58.011 --> 08:00.011
to go in the water first,

08:00.097 --> 08:01.763
find the anomalous stone,

08:01.849 --> 08:03.682
and then we'll go in
and look at it afterwards.

08:03.767 --> 08:04.966
Diver's ready for the water.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.417
Diver is clear to go?

08:06.470 --> 08:08.353
-Yep.
-All right, okay.

08:13.899 --> 08:15.232
- Diver in the water!

08:15.300 --> 08:17.183
Approximately 300 feet

08:17.269 --> 08:19.569
off the south shore
of Oak Island,

08:19.655 --> 08:23.907
Marty Lagina, his son Alex,
Craig Tester,

08:23.992 --> 08:26.409
and other members of the
Oak Island team are searching

08:26.445 --> 08:28.411
for a mysterious
triangle-shaped object

08:28.447 --> 08:31.197
that might be an important clue

08:31.283 --> 08:33.250
in solving
the Oak Island mystery.

08:33.284 --> 08:34.833
Hello, Rod?

08:39.174 --> 08:41.674
-Diver leaving surface!
- Copy!

08:41.760 --> 08:44.126
As marine
archaeologist Rod Peterson

08:44.212 --> 08:47.597
begins a careful exploration
of the ocean floor,

08:47.633 --> 08:50.517
his communication system
will allow him

08:50.636 --> 08:52.636
to keep the team
informed of his progress.

08:54.556 --> 08:55.722
Diver on bottom.

08:55.807 --> 08:59.476
Uh, Rod, what's
the visibility like?

09:03.115 --> 09:04.197
Roger that.

09:12.541 --> 09:14.824
Roger that.

09:14.910 --> 09:16.493
Systems are all
working good, right?

09:16.578 --> 09:18.328
So now where's the object?

09:18.380 --> 09:20.029
Rod's on the job.

09:20.132 --> 09:23.416
So far, Rod has been unable

09:23.502 --> 09:26.469
to locate the strange
triangle-shaped object.

09:26.555 --> 09:28.471
Is it possible
that it's been covered

09:28.557 --> 09:31.341
by silt and underwater
vegetation?

09:31.393 --> 09:34.394
Or, as with so many
other anomalies

09:34.513 --> 09:37.314
associated with Oak Island,

09:37.399 --> 09:40.049
has it, too,
mysteriously disappeared?

09:40.152 --> 09:43.403
Are you seeing anything
of interest yet, Rod?

09:45.023 --> 09:46.573
Roger that, Rod.

09:50.662 --> 09:54.581
Suddenly, Rod sees
a strange stone formation

09:54.700 --> 09:56.416
just a few yards away.

10:03.508 --> 10:05.759
Yeah, there were actually
little rocks around it.

10:12.134 --> 10:13.049
Roger that.

10:13.135 --> 10:14.684
What have you found, Rod?

10:22.894 --> 10:24.728
Roger that.

10:24.796 --> 10:26.730
-Well, we found it.
-We found it.

10:26.782 --> 10:28.064
We found the rock.

10:28.150 --> 10:29.599
Now to decide
if it means anything.

10:31.703 --> 10:34.704
See if you can see any
markings on top of the rock.

10:37.042 --> 10:39.409
If this rock
really does have markings

10:39.494 --> 10:42.412
or evidence
that it is man-made,

10:42.497 --> 10:44.714
it may also offer
the team clues

10:44.800 --> 10:47.784
as to what the treasure is,
who buried it,

10:47.886 --> 10:51.671
and, more importantly,
where it might be found.

10:59.598 --> 11:01.231
Does it look possibly man-made?

11:07.739 --> 11:10.273
Now that Rod has found
the triangle-shaped rock,

11:10.358 --> 11:13.326
he will make a thorough
inspection of it.

11:16.164 --> 11:17.914
Roger that.

11:17.999 --> 11:21.868
Okay, Rod, we need you
to mark that, uh, location.

11:21.953 --> 11:23.453
Okay.

11:23.538 --> 11:25.988
Rod then deploys an SMB,

11:26.091 --> 11:27.841
or submersible marker buoy,

11:27.926 --> 11:30.343
to temporarily mark
the location of the stone.

11:32.097 --> 11:32.995
Roger that.

11:33.098 --> 11:34.714
Okay, deploying the SMB.

11:36.468 --> 11:38.518
SMB is gonna be deployed.

11:39.938 --> 11:40.970
There it is.

11:41.056 --> 11:42.522
Beauty.

11:44.726 --> 11:48.445
While Marty Lagina
and members of the team

11:48.530 --> 11:51.347
wait for Rod Peterson
to return to the boat

11:51.450 --> 11:54.250
for a full debriefing,
his brother Rick

11:54.319 --> 11:57.487
and fellow treasure hunter
Dave Blankenship

11:57.539 --> 12:00.857
begin making
the final preparations at 10-X

12:00.926 --> 12:03.960
for Harvey Morash's
potential dive.

12:03.995 --> 12:05.879
They are also trying
to determine

12:05.997 --> 12:09.031
the exact location
of a 20-foot-long drill bar

12:09.084 --> 12:12.635
that is wedged in the 27-inch
portion of the shaft.

12:12.721 --> 12:15.538
Look, if we're gonna send divers
down into the cavity,

12:15.640 --> 12:18.758
they need all the information
we can give them.

12:18.844 --> 12:22.879
This probe will tell us when
it comes in contact with metal.

12:22.948 --> 12:26.015
To aid them in their efforts,
Rick has obtained

12:26.101 --> 12:28.434
the dipper-T
well casing indicator--

12:28.520 --> 12:30.987
a probe that
can detect and record

12:31.072 --> 12:34.324
the depth of underground
metallic objects.

12:34.359 --> 12:38.528
As the probe
is lowered down 181 feet

12:38.580 --> 12:41.831
and into the 27-inch portion
of 10-X,

12:41.917 --> 12:45.168
the magnetic tip will be able
to locate any objects

12:45.203 --> 12:47.537
that have a magnetic field--

12:47.622 --> 12:50.540
in this case,
a steel drill bar.

12:51.910 --> 12:56.129
Okay, so I'll drop it
in the 27-inch.

12:56.214 --> 12:57.680
You eyeball the measurement.

12:57.766 --> 13:00.683
As soon as it comes in contact
with the top of the bar,

13:00.769 --> 13:03.636
we'll know where it is-- if
we can get right on top of it.

13:05.724 --> 13:09.108
What's, um...
what's 181 in meters?

13:09.227 --> 13:12.862
-Roughly, I believe it's 55.
-55. Okay, eyeball that.

13:12.948 --> 13:15.698
- What do we got right now?
-I got 59.

13:15.734 --> 13:17.534
58 right there on top.

13:17.602 --> 13:19.235
We're in the 27-inch.

13:19.321 --> 13:21.154
Okay, at this point,

13:21.239 --> 13:24.240
it should ring as soon as it
comes in contact with the steel.

13:24.309 --> 13:26.776
62...

13:26.878 --> 13:28.628
63 on top...

13:28.747 --> 13:30.480
64 coming up.

13:31.583 --> 13:34.050
-(beep) -Ooh. Ooh.
-What was that beep?

13:34.135 --> 13:36.219
Could that be the bar?

13:36.304 --> 13:38.421
That's a good question.

13:38.523 --> 13:40.673
Hang on to that.
Let me get in there and...

13:40.759 --> 13:42.592
kind of wave it around.

13:42.677 --> 13:44.644
We don't like that.

13:49.150 --> 13:51.985
Remember when...
when your father came up

13:52.070 --> 13:54.103
on that 90,

13:54.155 --> 13:55.321
-when she collapsed?
-Yeah.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.040
And what was
the first thing he said?

13:57.108 --> 13:58.241
-"Don't tell your mother."
-Don't tell my brother.

14:00.412 --> 14:02.178
Do you think

14:02.247 --> 14:05.198
-it's on this side of the 27?
-Yep.

14:05.283 --> 14:08.084
- There it is.

14:08.153 --> 14:09.953
-It can't be anything but.
-Okay, there you go.

14:10.055 --> 14:12.171
Okay, I'll... I'll just...
I got it.

14:12.257 --> 14:14.323
62, 30... 30...

14:14.426 --> 14:16.960
- 30?
-62, 30.

14:17.045 --> 14:19.462
That's where she is.

14:19.514 --> 14:22.665
The probe has located
the drill bar

14:22.767 --> 14:25.001
at approximately 62 meters--

14:25.053 --> 14:27.637
or 204 feet--

14:27.706 --> 14:30.840
meaning that
it's 23 feet below the mouth

14:30.892 --> 14:34.611
of the 27-inch portion
of the borehole.

14:34.696 --> 14:38.064
 We now know,
after all this time,

14:38.149 --> 14:39.866
it's at 204 feet.

14:39.985 --> 14:41.451
We've never known that.

14:41.536 --> 14:43.820
Given the difficulty

14:43.872 --> 14:46.239
of reaching
the bottom of 10-X

14:46.324 --> 14:49.208
through a narrow,
27-inch-wide hole,

14:49.327 --> 14:52.095
knowing the exact location
of the drill bar

14:52.163 --> 14:55.999
might help Harvey maneuver
around it more successfully.

14:56.084 --> 14:58.801
It could also make
the critical difference

14:58.887 --> 15:02.305
between the dive's
success or failure...

15:02.340 --> 15:05.875
and if Marty and Rick
are ever going to find out

15:05.977 --> 15:08.878
if there really is
a man-made treasure vault

15:08.980 --> 15:14.050
lying some 235 feet
below the island's surface.

15:14.152 --> 15:17.153
Okay, let's go.

15:25.505 --> 15:27.422
has located
what he believes to be

15:27.507 --> 15:29.474
the mysterious
triangle-shaped rock

15:29.576 --> 15:32.393
some 300 feet
off of the southern shore

15:32.512 --> 15:35.063
of Oak Island,
Marty Lagina and the team

15:35.148 --> 15:38.650
are eager to hear
his professional analysis.

15:38.735 --> 15:40.051
Debriefing time.

15:40.153 --> 15:41.820
Tell us, what did you see?
What does it mean?

15:41.888 --> 15:44.272
You know, are you excited
about it? Is it man-made?

15:44.357 --> 15:46.557
Are their chisel marks?
Is it golden idols?

15:46.660 --> 15:49.577
-You know, anchor points? What?!

15:49.696 --> 15:51.062
I definitely think
it's the object

15:51.114 --> 15:52.497
we saw on the sonar survey.

15:52.582 --> 15:54.065
It's a larger rock

15:54.117 --> 15:56.251
in a field of smaller ones.

15:56.336 --> 15:58.703
Definitely triangular in shape,
with indentation

15:58.755 --> 16:01.589
-on the top; that's probably
the shadow we picked up. -Right.

16:01.708 --> 16:03.591
I took, uh, bearings

16:03.710 --> 16:06.177
off all points on the triangle,

16:06.213 --> 16:08.213
and one of the points
on the indentation

16:08.298 --> 16:12.100
runs directly zero to 180, that
bearing that we were looking for

16:12.219 --> 16:13.635
heading back towards the island.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.520
Fantastic.

16:15.605 --> 16:17.522
Zero degrees points

16:17.607 --> 16:19.807
exactly back to that,
um, orange marker

16:19.926 --> 16:22.560
on the land,
which is the stone triangle.

16:22.612 --> 16:26.781
Before the dive,
Tony Sampson marked the place

16:26.900 --> 16:28.600
on the island's south shore

16:28.702 --> 16:30.768
where a mysterious
triangle of stones

16:30.871 --> 16:31.870
was first discovered

16:31.972 --> 16:35.607
back in 1897.

16:35.709 --> 16:39.244
Although various excavations
and treasure searches

16:39.346 --> 16:42.247
caused the stones
to be lost over the years,

16:42.349 --> 16:44.115
it is believed
that they pointed

16:44.184 --> 16:46.668
directly at the Money Pit.

16:46.786 --> 16:48.586
All right. I think we got
something to look at, Alex.

16:48.688 --> 16:50.755
-Yeah. -I mean, now that
we know what we're doing.

16:50.807 --> 16:52.557
- You want to do a jump...?
-Yes! Let's get in the water.

16:52.592 --> 16:54.058
-You know? Let's give it a try.
-Okay. Fantastic.

16:54.144 --> 16:55.126
 The marine archaeologist

16:55.228 --> 16:57.145
thought that it could have

16:57.264 --> 16:59.013
some man-made features to it.

16:59.099 --> 17:00.682
Hey, that's exciting.

17:00.767 --> 17:01.900
I want to see it.

17:01.985 --> 17:02.850
Okay, you ready?

17:02.936 --> 17:05.002
-Yep. -Okay.

17:21.922 --> 17:25.589
If the stone triangle
in the water can be identified

17:25.675 --> 17:27.558
as pointing in the direction

17:27.627 --> 17:29.127
of the old stone triangle

17:29.179 --> 17:31.129
and the Money Pit,

17:31.181 --> 17:33.881
it could be evidence that it
was deliberately left there

17:33.967 --> 17:37.518
as a marker,
perhaps centuries ago.

17:37.637 --> 17:40.021
We'll see what
Marty and Alex see

17:40.106 --> 17:41.222
and decide what to do.

17:41.308 --> 17:44.025
I went down just fine.

17:44.110 --> 17:45.610
I descended just right.

17:45.695 --> 17:47.228
I got to the bottom,
I saw the stone.

17:47.314 --> 17:49.230
It was not that big.

17:49.316 --> 17:52.650
But it was certainly
triangular.

17:55.372 --> 17:57.855
After spending several minutes

17:57.907 --> 18:01.209
looking at
the strange-shaped rock,

18:01.294 --> 18:05.129
Marty and Alex
return to the boat.

18:05.165 --> 18:08.666
Meanwhile, diver Tony Sampson

18:08.718 --> 18:11.035
continues searching
for a possible connection

18:11.087 --> 18:12.870
between
the triangle-shaped rock

18:12.922 --> 18:16.724
and strategic areas
on Oak Island.

18:22.315 --> 18:23.314
You saw it, right?

18:23.350 --> 18:24.816
Oh, I saw it.

18:24.901 --> 18:26.384
It's this big.

18:26.486 --> 18:29.153
-Okay. -I looked at the rock
pretty carefully.

18:29.189 --> 18:31.939
It's definitely
triangular-shaped, you're right,

18:32.025 --> 18:33.274
but it was only...

18:33.360 --> 18:34.993
I mean, does this sound
about right to you?

18:35.078 --> 18:36.160
-About like that?
-Um, maybe...

18:36.196 --> 18:37.745
Like that and like that?

18:37.864 --> 18:39.080
Yeah, it was definitely

18:39.199 --> 18:40.898
-elongated on one side.
- Yes.

18:41.001 --> 18:44.919
You know, it's triangular.
I see why you said this is it.

18:45.038 --> 18:48.039
-All right, well, mystery is
still a mystery. -Yeah.

18:48.124 --> 18:50.208
-Yup.
-Yeah.

18:50.293 --> 18:53.744
Although, as far
as Marty Lagina is concerned,

18:53.847 --> 18:56.881
the results of the dive
have proven inconclusive,

18:56.933 --> 19:01.936
Tony Sampson continues his
search along the ocean floor.

19:02.055 --> 19:04.255
He is not convinced

19:04.307 --> 19:07.758
that the rock Rod Peterson
located earlier is

19:07.861 --> 19:11.696
the same triangle-shaped object
the team has been looking for.

19:11.731 --> 19:16.651
Suddenly, Tony spots
an unusual stone object

19:16.736 --> 19:18.736
covered with vegetation.

19:24.828 --> 19:26.044
- Tony!
- Yeah, Marty.

19:26.129 --> 19:27.245
Let me help you with your kit.

19:27.313 --> 19:29.297
So, where the hell did you go?

19:29.416 --> 19:30.998
-Oh, I took a bit of a swim.
-All right.

19:31.117 --> 19:33.000
I got something
to tell you when I get up, huh?

19:33.119 --> 19:34.852
Well, get up here and tell us.

19:34.921 --> 19:39.757
Tony had logically decided
to follow the magnetic north

19:39.843 --> 19:42.677
bearing from the first stone
all the way to shore

19:42.762 --> 19:44.929
to see if there was anything
lining up.

19:45.031 --> 19:46.297
-All right.
-Whoa.

19:46.399 --> 19:47.832
So what I did was,

19:47.934 --> 19:49.200
when we went down
on that initial

19:49.269 --> 19:51.169
-triangular rock there...
-Yeah?

19:51.237 --> 19:54.021
I swam that, um, northerly
bearing like we talked about.

19:54.140 --> 19:57.325
-Yeah.
-And from the little rock,

19:57.410 --> 19:59.210
it was approximately 20 meters,

19:59.279 --> 20:02.813
and I came across
another big triangle rock.

20:02.866 --> 20:05.816
-Okay. -Well, the strange thing,
or the weird thing,

20:05.869 --> 20:07.919
Marty, is, uh, both those
rocks-- the ones you

20:07.954 --> 20:10.037
and Alex dived on and the, um,
and the bigger triangle

20:10.123 --> 20:13.424
rock, as well-- they're both
on that same 360 heading,

20:13.510 --> 20:16.010
you know, going north,
pointing straight towards

20:16.129 --> 20:19.964
the stone triangle on the shore
and the Money Pit.

20:20.049 --> 20:21.632
You make heads
or tails out of that, Craig?

20:21.684 --> 20:23.501
No. I mean,
it's getting shallower, right?

20:23.603 --> 20:25.669
-Like the big one?
-Yeah. Yeah.

20:25.772 --> 20:27.722
Shallow enough
to have been aerially exposed

20:27.807 --> 20:29.023
if you throw in erosion?

20:29.142 --> 20:31.025
-Maybe.
-Maybe, yeah.

20:31.144 --> 20:33.444
-You'd have to throw in erosion
for sure. -Yeah.

20:33.530 --> 20:36.364
On a recent trip

20:36.449 --> 20:38.449
to the Bedford Institute
of Oceanography in Halifax,

20:38.485 --> 20:41.685
Alex Lagina, Jack Begley

20:41.788 --> 20:44.372
and island historian
Charles Barkhouse

20:44.457 --> 20:48.826
were eager to find out if,
several hundred years ago,

20:48.878 --> 20:50.211
the Oak Island shoreline

20:50.330 --> 20:52.380
could have had
a much different shape.

20:52.465 --> 20:54.999
BOB COURTNEY: And in the past,
sea level was lower,

20:55.051 --> 20:59.137
probably a meter or two lower
300 years ago or 400 years ago.

20:59.222 --> 21:04.175
-Okay. -So, probably
this shoreline was out somewhat.

21:04.260 --> 21:07.345
 So the Bedford Institute
added validity

21:07.430 --> 21:09.730
to the shoreline issue.

21:09.816 --> 21:11.599
Not only did
the sea level come up,

21:11.684 --> 21:13.818
but it's highly erosional,
apparently,

21:13.903 --> 21:15.520
near where we're working.

21:15.605 --> 21:19.774
So, the stone that Tony found,
if it was placed by humans,

21:19.859 --> 21:21.892
would have been above sea level
at the time,

21:21.995 --> 21:24.912
or probably above
the low tide mark.

21:24.998 --> 21:27.031
So if you think about it,
that would be a great way

21:27.083 --> 21:29.000
to conceal a marker
for only those who know.

21:29.085 --> 21:32.736
One stone you can see, one stone
you have to find underwater,

21:32.839 --> 21:35.239
and then, you just set
a buoy on that one,

21:35.341 --> 21:37.458
and then, there you go--
there's your sight line.

21:37.544 --> 21:41.546
The team has now
found two more possible clues

21:41.648 --> 21:46.100
that might help them solve
the 220-year-old mystery.

21:46.186 --> 21:50.021
Clues that might provide
further evidence

21:50.106 --> 21:53.991
that the treasure really can be
found at the exact place

21:54.060 --> 21:56.260
where the stone triangles
point--

21:56.362 --> 21:59.630
in the Oak Island Money Pit.

22:07.210 --> 22:09.794
-I guess I have high hopes
for this. -Yeah, I do, too.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.513
I think he's going
to go in one end,

22:11.598 --> 22:13.915
come out the other end,
and say "No problem."

22:13.967 --> 22:15.183
Wow. That would be fabulous.

22:15.218 --> 22:16.751
Then he still has to, you know,

22:16.853 --> 22:18.019
get his courage up

22:18.054 --> 22:19.754
-to do the actual dive, though.
-Yeah.

22:19.856 --> 22:21.189
Well, here we are.

22:21.224 --> 22:22.941
After weeks of preparation

22:23.059 --> 22:27.094
and an exhaustive search
for someone willing and able

22:27.147 --> 22:29.063
to attempt the dive down 10-X,

22:29.149 --> 22:31.199
the team is hopeful

22:31.268 --> 22:33.568
they have finally
found the right person

22:33.620 --> 22:36.103
for the difficult
and dangerous job--

22:36.156 --> 22:39.774
professional deep wreck diver
Harvey Morash.

22:39.876 --> 22:42.276
 This pipe is one inch
less in diameter.

22:42.329 --> 22:44.278
It's 26 inches in diameter.

22:44.331 --> 22:47.715
The real pipe
in the hole is 27 inches.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.050
If he gets through there,

22:49.135 --> 22:50.385
he should easily get
through the other one.

22:50.420 --> 22:52.754
-I'm ready to go.
- Okay.

22:52.806 --> 22:55.974
-We want to see
that big thumbs-up. -Okay.

22:56.092 --> 22:59.627
I hope I can give it to you.

22:59.729 --> 23:02.730
For Rick, Marty and the team,

23:02.766 --> 23:06.100
the stakes of this test dive
could not be greater.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.937
They are determined
to send a diver down

23:08.989 --> 23:12.240
to the bottom
of Borehole 10-X to see if

23:12.325 --> 23:15.827
as their friend and partner,
Dan Blankenship, maintains

23:15.912 --> 23:19.146
there really exists
a man-made treasure vault,

23:19.249 --> 23:21.816
complete
with a mysterious chest

23:21.918 --> 23:24.953
and possibly the remains
of a dead body,

23:25.005 --> 23:29.257
lying 235 feet
below the island's surface.

23:29.359 --> 23:31.459
We have some trepidation because

23:31.544 --> 23:33.595
if he doesn't fit
through that pipe,

23:33.630 --> 23:35.630
then this method is basically
off the table.

23:35.732 --> 23:38.016
I mean, it's pretty much
as simple as that.

23:38.101 --> 23:40.101
He has to fit through,
and he has to fit through

23:40.186 --> 23:42.770
comfortably enough
to attempt the dive.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.939
So, you know,
we're a little concerned.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.788
He's trying it first
with his full normal setup,

24:00.824 --> 24:03.558
but then he's got different
stuff if he doesn't fit.

24:12.002 --> 24:13.635
I'm hoping he fits
with his normal setup,

24:13.720 --> 24:15.086
because
that would be the safest.

24:50.123 --> 24:51.622
Harvey has made it

24:51.708 --> 24:54.342
into the 26-inch-wide
steel casing.

24:54.377 --> 24:56.511
However, he will still need

24:56.546 --> 24:58.479
to maneuver
through the narrow hole

24:58.548 --> 25:03.084
without damaging his equipment
or getting stuck.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.303
I can't see him.

25:12.962 --> 25:14.395
Well, I see them bubbles
come out the other end.

25:14.481 --> 25:15.563
He's close right now.

25:29.212 --> 25:30.611
He's out.

25:33.383 --> 25:35.717
Yeah, still, I want to see
that big grinning thumbs-up.

25:35.752 --> 25:38.052
Then I'll say it's a done deal.

25:40.840 --> 25:44.258
ALL:
There he is.

25:44.327 --> 25:46.511
Thumbs-up? Did you do it?
Does that just mean

25:46.596 --> 25:48.763
-you can breathe?
-Put it this way,

25:48.865 --> 25:50.798
I'm glad I didn't have
a big lunch.

25:52.152 --> 25:53.985
Really? That tight?

25:54.070 --> 25:57.004
-It's snug.
-Mm-hmm.

25:57.073 --> 25:58.856
Is that your full kit you got
on there? That would be your...

25:58.942 --> 26:00.491
That's what I would be wearing.

26:00.610 --> 26:03.411
 Do you have enough to
where you want to do this dive?

26:05.782 --> 26:09.050
We want to cross 10-X
off the list, and...

26:09.152 --> 26:11.002
the exciting part will be
if he says he's willing

26:11.087 --> 26:13.821
to go down there, I think
we'll accomplish our goal.

26:13.873 --> 26:15.356
Um...

26:18.044 --> 26:19.160
Yeah.

26:20.346 --> 26:21.395
All right!

26:21.498 --> 26:23.030
So that's the plan, anyway.

26:23.133 --> 26:24.265
That's great.

26:24.300 --> 26:25.266
We got a guy who can do the job.

26:25.301 --> 26:26.467
Yeah, I think so, too.

26:26.519 --> 26:28.136
Go in, have some more fun.

26:28.238 --> 26:30.138
Thank you.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.973
Let's move on.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.442
Come on, guys.

26:38.148 --> 26:41.348
It is the end of
another long but productive day

26:41.451 --> 26:43.117
on Oak Island.

26:43.153 --> 26:45.186
And now, less than 24 hours

26:45.238 --> 26:49.407
before Harvey Morash attempts
his critically important dive,

26:49.492 --> 26:52.376
Rick, Marty,
and their team meet

26:52.462 --> 26:55.129
with Oak Island researcher
Jeff Irving.

26:55.165 --> 26:58.583
He has traveled all the way
from New Brunswick, Canada,

26:58.668 --> 27:01.202
at the invitation
of Jack Begley,

27:01.254 --> 27:03.888
who, after hearing
Irving's compelling theory,

27:04.007 --> 27:08.259
thought it plausible enough
to share with the entire team.

27:08.344 --> 27:09.977
Thanks for having me, fellas.

27:10.063 --> 27:12.814
I think one
of the hardest challenges

27:12.899 --> 27:15.983
in any conversation
is to get to the truth.

27:16.069 --> 27:20.071
I dig like a dog with a bone,
'cause I want the truth.

27:20.190 --> 27:22.440
You know, I've been at this
eight hours a day.

27:22.525 --> 27:25.243
This is all I've done
for the last year and a half.

27:25.361 --> 27:27.394
Basically,
I've connected the dots.

27:27.447 --> 27:30.198
Well, start with your first dot
and bring us down the dots.

27:30.283 --> 27:32.867
Well, I was
researching treasure, but then,

27:32.936 --> 27:34.919
you know, I said,

27:35.004 --> 27:38.956
"What's all the effort about?
It can't be about pirate gold."

27:39.042 --> 27:42.576
Too much effort, too many people
involved over time,

27:42.629 --> 27:45.079
too much secrecy.

27:45.181 --> 27:49.383
What I think we're looking for
is the Ark of the Covenant.

27:49.469 --> 27:52.086
The Ark of the Covenant?

27:52.188 --> 27:56.057
The gold-covered chest which
held the Ten Commandments?

27:56.109 --> 27:57.491
Every time somebody says,

27:57.560 --> 27:59.110
you know, "I've done this study,

27:59.195 --> 28:00.695
"and I've determined that the

28:00.730 --> 28:02.430
Ark of the Covenant
is buried over here,"

28:02.532 --> 28:04.398
you get this sort of
little frisson of excitement,

28:04.450 --> 28:06.617
because, you know, he

28:06.736 --> 28:08.619
does believe
and I want to believe.

28:08.738 --> 28:11.072
And so you get
these people telling you

28:11.157 --> 28:13.541
there's these immense riches
on Oak Island,

28:13.626 --> 28:15.209
and you get kind of excited
about it.

28:15.295 --> 28:18.079
To me, everything's together,

28:18.164 --> 28:20.164
all these religious artifacts.

28:20.250 --> 28:23.217
If they've been guarded up
until, you know,

28:23.303 --> 28:24.552
the time of the destruction
of the temple,

28:24.637 --> 28:28.306
then there's 1,500 years' worth

28:28.391 --> 28:31.175
of successful guardianship.

28:31.261 --> 28:35.846
One of the aspects is
who is involved.

28:35.932 --> 28:38.099
Okay? There's a lot
of people involved.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.935
Templars are involved.
Masons are involved.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.970
You know,
there have been other theories

28:43.022 --> 28:45.472
-that have proposed
that Henry Sinclair, -Yeah.

28:45.575 --> 28:48.526
-that his voyage supposedly
over here, -Yeah. Right.

28:48.611 --> 28:51.579
-do you buy into that?
-Personally, I believe

28:51.664 --> 28:54.498
in the Sinclair coming in 1398,

28:54.584 --> 28:57.034
because it makes sense.
I support it,

28:57.120 --> 29:00.487
just not that he brought
anything with him.

29:00.590 --> 29:03.124
Okay? I think he was the scout.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.209
At this point,

29:05.295 --> 29:08.095
I will tell you that I believe
Christopher Columbus

29:08.181 --> 29:13.050
was responsible for the Ark
coming to Oak Island.

29:18.566 --> 29:21.000
Christopher Columbus

29:21.102 --> 29:24.687
was responsible for the Ark
coming to Oak Island.

29:26.107 --> 29:27.940
Christopher Columbus?

29:28.043 --> 29:30.243
The famed Italian explorer

29:30.345 --> 29:32.912
credited with discovering
the New World on behalf

29:32.981 --> 29:35.515
of Spain in 1492?

29:35.617 --> 29:37.917
Could Columbus' mission

29:37.952 --> 29:40.536
to the New World have also had
a secret motive,

29:40.622 --> 29:43.389
to hide one
of the world's most sacred

29:43.458 --> 29:46.042
religious treasures
on Oak Island?

29:46.127 --> 29:50.496
The only known portrait
of Columbus with any accuracy

29:50.598 --> 29:52.515
shows him showing the symbol

29:52.634 --> 29:54.967
meaning "the word of God."

29:57.889 --> 30:00.339
Christopher Columbus
was supposedly related

30:00.442 --> 30:02.025
to the Sinclairs.

30:02.143 --> 30:04.477
Of course, the Sinclairs have
the Templar connection.

30:04.529 --> 30:07.980
Christopher Columbus has other
Templar connections as well.

30:08.066 --> 30:12.151
According to Jeff Irving's
incredible theory,

30:12.253 --> 30:14.153
Christopher Columbus
was directly connected

30:14.255 --> 30:16.489
to the Knights Templar
through his wife,

30:16.558 --> 30:18.991
Filipa Moniz Perestrelo,

30:19.077 --> 30:21.244
a Portuguese noblewoman.

30:21.329 --> 30:24.964
Her father,
Bartolomeu Perestrelo,

30:25.050 --> 30:27.467
was a Grand Master
in the Knights of Christ,

30:27.502 --> 30:29.719
which was
a Portuguese incarnation

30:29.838 --> 30:32.338
of the Knights Templar.
Perestrelo

30:32.440 --> 30:36.209
was also related
to Henry Sinclair by marriage.

30:36.277 --> 30:38.711
Although
both the Knights Templar

30:38.813 --> 30:40.563
and the Knights of Christ
were frowned upon

30:40.648 --> 30:43.182
by the Roman Catholic Church,

30:43.268 --> 30:45.017
many
of the Portuguese explorers

30:45.086 --> 30:46.586
of the New World were members,

30:46.654 --> 30:49.355
including Vasco da Gama,

30:49.457 --> 30:50.940
the Corte-Real brothers,

30:51.025 --> 30:52.759
and Henry the Navigator.

30:52.827 --> 30:57.263
It is for this reason
that they, along with Columbus,

30:57.365 --> 31:00.116
sailed across the Atlantic
to the New World

31:00.201 --> 31:02.001
with the Portuguese version
of the Templar cross

31:02.103 --> 31:04.069
on their sails,

31:04.172 --> 31:07.123
the same cross
that area historian

31:07.208 --> 31:08.758
and stone carving expert

31:08.843 --> 31:11.461
Terry Deveau identified
as being similar

31:11.546 --> 31:14.931
to the one carved
on the so-called Overton Stone

31:15.016 --> 31:20.186
located 144 miles southwest
of Oak Island.

31:20.271 --> 31:23.139
This particular shape of cross

31:23.224 --> 31:24.774
is not all that common,

31:24.859 --> 31:28.427
where you have the flaring
outwards of the arms.

31:28.480 --> 31:32.231
You mainly see it
in Portuguese crosses.

31:33.651 --> 31:36.002
Is it possible that, based

31:36.104 --> 31:38.504
h hisonononnections
to the Knights Templar,

31:38.573 --> 31:40.239
Christopher Columbus knew
of an island

31:40.308 --> 31:41.741
inin the North Atlantic

31:41.826 --> 31:43.609
that had secret tunnels
designed

31:43.678 --> 31:45.978
to hide sacred treasures?

31:46.047 --> 31:49.298
Pretty much every step he made
was documented.

31:49.417 --> 31:51.116
And who'd he bring it here with?

31:51.219 --> 31:53.219
A gentleman by the name
of Juan Pérez.

31:53.304 --> 31:57.590
Juan Pérez was the accountant
of Queen Isabella.

31:57.675 --> 32:01.511
She was one of two people
that convinced the Spanish crown

32:01.596 --> 32:03.229
to fund the expedition.

32:03.314 --> 32:05.297
But he disappeared

32:05.400 --> 32:06.766
once he got here.
All trace of him was lost.

32:06.851 --> 32:09.402
You're not gonna lose

32:09.487 --> 32:11.771
the main guy that...

32:11.856 --> 32:14.490
helped you get
all your financing.

32:14.609 --> 32:16.659
Marty, would you lose track
of Rick?

32:16.778 --> 32:18.578
-No.
-Exactly.

32:18.663 --> 32:21.080
No matter what,
you're gonna cover his back.

32:21.115 --> 32:23.699
What was he doing
while he was lost?

32:23.785 --> 32:25.618
- I-I don't know.
-He was up here

32:25.670 --> 32:28.654
burying the treasure.
Who helped?

32:28.756 --> 32:31.424
Who also disappeared
shortly thereafter?

32:31.459 --> 32:33.543
Long about 1503.

32:33.628 --> 32:38.014
The Real boys from Portugal.

32:38.132 --> 32:40.900
In 1501, Portuguese explorer

32:40.969 --> 32:44.237
and Knight of Christ
Gaspar Corte-Real

32:44.339 --> 32:47.056
reached what he called
Terra Verde,

32:47.141 --> 32:50.276
oror whahat is known
as Greenland.

32:50.311 --> 32:53.196
It has been reported
that he then sailed south,

32:53.314 --> 32:56.115
never to be heard from again.

32:56.184 --> 32:58.367
One year later,
Gaspar's brother Miguel,

32:58.486 --> 33:02.187
who was also a member of
the Portuguese Templar order,

33:02.240 --> 33:03.956
reportedly went to find him,

33:04.042 --> 33:07.743
and he, too,
mysteriously disappeared.

33:07.829 --> 33:10.162
Is it possible,
as Jeff Irving believes,

33:10.265 --> 33:13.132
that the two brothers
did not go missing,

33:13.218 --> 33:16.085
but instead were part
of a secret Templar plan

33:16.204 --> 33:19.922
to hide sacred religious
treasure on Oak Island?

33:20.041 --> 33:22.091
If you guys buried
the treasure here...

33:22.210 --> 33:24.076
-Yes. -...are you just gonna
walk away and leave it?

33:24.178 --> 33:28.014
Assuming that the ground
is gonna look after it?

33:28.099 --> 33:30.383
And nobody's gonna find it?

33:30.468 --> 33:33.185
You just gonna walk away,
sail away into the sunset?

33:33.271 --> 33:34.804
Matters what our intent is,
I suppose-- why we're there.

33:34.889 --> 33:37.189
If it's the hiding spot,
why would you?

33:37.275 --> 33:38.524
You're gonna stay,
and you're gonna guard it.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.610
You're gonna disappear

33:40.728 --> 33:43.029
from history. You're going

33:43.114 --> 33:45.231
to make friends
with the aboriginals,

33:45.283 --> 33:46.566
you're gonna blend in with them,

33:46.651 --> 33:48.200
you're going to marry 'em,

33:48.303 --> 33:50.286
and you're just gonna disappear

33:50.405 --> 33:52.738
into the new guardians.

33:54.909 --> 33:57.410
You have the cross
with the circle,

33:57.495 --> 34:00.246
the eagle feather,
and behind the eagle feather,

34:00.298 --> 34:01.998
there are a pair
of tobacco leaves.

34:02.116 --> 34:04.617
There you have
a friendship treaty

34:04.669 --> 34:07.970
between Europeans and Mi'kmaq.

34:08.056 --> 34:10.473
It is my theory
that what you're looking for

34:10.592 --> 34:12.425
is actually
the Ark of the Covenant,

34:12.476 --> 34:15.226
and I believe
it was smuggled out of Jerusalem

34:15.313 --> 34:17.679
by the Knights Templar,
where it went to Scotland,

34:17.764 --> 34:19.732
and then it was brought here

34:19.817 --> 34:24.520
by Columbus and company,
you know, in 1500.

34:24.606 --> 34:26.188
 Well, you know, Jeff,
I mean it, it's always

34:26.274 --> 34:27.657
-interesting to meet a theorist.
-Yes.

34:27.775 --> 34:29.992
Somebody who has spent the time

34:30.110 --> 34:32.078
and due diligence
in terms of research.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.846
I think we've all learned
something today, and,

34:33.947 --> 34:37.283
-so let us look into it. It's a
lot to digest. -Sure. It is.

34:37.335 --> 34:38.868
But we're very, very grateful.
I think we all are.

34:38.953 --> 34:41.621
Might it be Jeff's theory?

34:41.672 --> 34:43.822
Maybe,
but it's like all theories.

34:43.875 --> 34:46.042
Could it be? I suppose.
Could be.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.760
But it's a theory.

34:47.844 --> 34:50.045
Right now,
as we sit here, it's a theory.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.014
JEFF:
I appreciate the time, and

34:52.100 --> 34:53.549
hopefully,
it will be good for you!

34:53.635 --> 34:57.136
- Thank you very much.
Okay. Thanks.

35:00.441 --> 35:03.309
It is the start
of what could be

35:03.411 --> 35:07.363
the most important day
in the history of Oak Island

35:07.448 --> 35:10.516
as Rick, Marty, Craig

35:10.618 --> 35:13.486
and the other members
of their team once again

35:13.571 --> 35:17.573
shift their focus to getting
a diver to the bottom of 10-X.

35:17.659 --> 35:20.376
We're off to put divers
in the hole. Rick, it happened.

35:20.495 --> 35:22.545
It's not happened yet.

35:22.630 --> 35:23.546
No, but it's happening.

35:23.631 --> 35:25.715
Make it so, then.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.833
We got the right guy, I think,

35:27.885 --> 35:30.553
the right crew,
the right backup team. We got

35:30.638 --> 35:33.556
everything right.
With any luck,

35:33.641 --> 35:35.975
we get a human being
into the 10-X cavity.

35:41.516 --> 35:43.232
You kept everything warm
and ready for us, have you?

35:43.351 --> 35:44.650
-It's no problem.

35:44.686 --> 35:46.652
-Nice to see you again.
-Good to see you.

35:46.688 --> 35:49.488
 You know,
what do you think, Charles?

35:49.524 --> 35:50.990
I mean, today, you know,

35:51.075 --> 35:52.742
this is the beginning
of the end of 10-X.

35:52.827 --> 35:54.660
Explore that cavity completely.

35:54.696 --> 35:56.395
And then?

35:56.447 --> 35:58.397
Then... then call it a day.

35:58.449 --> 36:00.366
Who's not excited?

36:00.451 --> 36:03.169
We're getting answers
to a 40-year quest.

36:03.271 --> 36:06.238
I thought every time
we got inside this, uh, fence,

36:06.340 --> 36:08.407
-we're supposed to be wearing
a harness, Rick. -Yes.

36:08.459 --> 36:10.743
What's in the bottom? You know?

36:10.795 --> 36:14.180
Thumbs-up-- which I believe
it will be-- or thumbs-down.

36:15.883 --> 36:17.433
It's the beginning of the end

36:17.552 --> 36:19.435
of 10-X.

36:29.731 --> 36:32.047
e ten-inch there, Harvey?

36:32.133 --> 36:35.050
-Yeah, the ten-inch over here?
-Right, and it's shackled

36:35.136 --> 36:37.186
to here. See that? The ten-inch
in the middle of the hole.

36:37.305 --> 36:39.221
Yeah. Yes.

36:39.307 --> 36:41.974
After months
of backbreaking preparation

36:42.026 --> 36:46.278
and years of planning,
Rick, Marty and their team

36:46.364 --> 36:49.031
could be just minutes away
from finding out

36:49.150 --> 36:52.485
if a man-made treasure chamber
really does lie

36:52.570 --> 36:55.121
at the bottom of 10-X.

36:55.206 --> 36:57.022
Can we get everybody over here
for a minute? We're gonna have

36:57.125 --> 36:58.691
a little safety talk.

37:01.329 --> 37:03.546
Okay, guys,

37:03.664 --> 37:05.531
the objective of this dive is
to give it our best.

37:05.583 --> 37:09.135
We can't make any promises.

37:09.220 --> 37:11.887
Assisting Harvey
Morash will be Michael Gerhartz

37:11.973 --> 37:14.507
on the audio
communications system

37:14.592 --> 37:18.093
and dive supervisor
Janine Goyetche.

37:18.179 --> 37:21.564
However, only Michael
will have the comm system

37:21.682 --> 37:24.049
connected to his dive helmet.

37:24.152 --> 37:25.067
Everything comes through Janine.

37:25.153 --> 37:26.402
Everything comes
through Janine.

37:26.521 --> 37:28.220
What she says goes.

37:28.322 --> 37:30.556
End of.
Any questions on that?

37:30.608 --> 37:34.059
Okay. Now,
we do have some hazards,

37:34.162 --> 37:36.946
and pretty much any of these
will end the dive immediately,

37:37.031 --> 37:41.283
and we'll begin our ascent.

37:41.369 --> 37:43.335
Some of the hazards
are equipment malfunction--

37:43.421 --> 37:45.371
our scuba gear or the comms.

37:45.423 --> 37:48.040
Anything like that,
dive is over.

37:49.961 --> 37:52.378
Where's the comms person
going to be?

37:52.430 --> 37:54.597
I... The comms person, I guess
she should be under cover here.

37:54.715 --> 37:57.183
- Okay. -As close as she
can get, really, under cover.

37:57.218 --> 37:59.585
If we have to move the tent
closer than that, that's fine.

37:59.687 --> 38:01.020
Who's going in first?

38:01.055 --> 38:04.640
-Apparently, I'm going in first.
-Okay.

38:04.725 --> 38:06.091
The plan is
that Harvey's the guy

38:06.143 --> 38:07.393
who's gonna go in the 27-inch.

38:07.478 --> 38:09.094
Michael is the backup guy,

38:09.146 --> 38:12.097
the communications guy,

38:12.149 --> 38:14.366
the safety guy who's gonna
be there to help, I guess,

38:14.402 --> 38:18.437
literally pull Harvey out
if it comes to that.

38:18.539 --> 38:20.439
So we're gonna try to be
as efficient as possible

38:20.541 --> 38:21.490
but as safe as possible.

38:21.576 --> 38:22.658
We can't eliminate risk

38:22.743 --> 38:24.043
but we can mitigate it.

38:24.128 --> 38:25.377
Hopefully

38:25.413 --> 38:27.463
we've set ourselves up
for success

38:27.548 --> 38:29.131
and we have a good dive,
'cause I want...

38:29.250 --> 38:30.799
I want to get in there
and see what's going on.

38:30.918 --> 38:33.002
To help prevent him

38:33.087 --> 38:35.304
from getting tangled up
in possible debris

38:35.423 --> 38:38.841
or other obstructions,
Harvey will not rely

38:38.926 --> 38:42.394
on a surface supply
breathing system.

38:42.430 --> 38:45.130
He will also not be wearing
a comm system,

38:45.182 --> 38:48.350
which would allow him
to talk to the surface.

38:48.436 --> 38:52.238
Instead,
he will wear two scuba tanks

38:52.323 --> 38:54.173
with a tri-mix air supply

38:54.275 --> 38:57.543
and will communicate directly
with his safety diver,

38:57.612 --> 38:59.161
Michael Gerhartz.

39:04.535 --> 39:07.503
Harvey is lowered
into 10-X first.

39:07.622 --> 39:09.988
Michael will follow him down

39:10.091 --> 39:13.459
but will remain
at the 181-foot level,

39:13.544 --> 39:17.496
attached to Harvey by means
of a single tether line.

39:17.548 --> 39:19.431
Going down.

39:19.517 --> 39:22.201
Yeah, that's what

39:22.303 --> 39:24.219
I'm concerned about
his tanks hitting on anything.

39:24.305 --> 39:28.307
As Harvey descends
and explores the shaft,

39:28.359 --> 39:30.309
he and Michael will communicate
with each other

39:30.361 --> 39:33.112
by giving short tugs
on the line.

39:33.197 --> 39:37.149
Watch your back, Harvey,
for that ten-inch!

39:37.201 --> 39:40.369
The only thing
we have is Mike's

39:40.488 --> 39:41.853
communication to the surface.

39:41.906 --> 39:44.523
Harvey will not have
any communication devices.

39:44.625 --> 39:47.293
So we're gonna really kind of
get a second-hand blow-by-blow,

39:47.378 --> 39:49.795
and we're anticipating
low visibility.

39:49.830 --> 39:53.165
So, we don't have real good,
real-time feedback.

39:53.250 --> 39:55.501
All stop!

39:55.553 --> 39:56.885
Stop!

39:59.757 --> 40:01.540
Good?

40:01.642 --> 40:04.476
Just-just give him a minute.
Okay.

40:04.562 --> 40:06.178
David, have 'em up.

40:11.919 --> 40:14.320
You good? Okay.

40:14.355 --> 40:16.855
Let's go!

40:23.397 --> 40:25.331
Keep going down.

40:25.366 --> 40:28.367
Both divers are in the water,

40:28.452 --> 40:30.336
and Harvey Morash is on his way

40:30.371 --> 40:33.339
to being the first person
to successfully reach

40:33.374 --> 40:38.210
the bottom of 10-X
in more than 20 years.

40:38.295 --> 40:42.848
But once down there,
what will he find?

40:42.950 --> 40:45.150
Man-made tunnels?

40:45.219 --> 40:48.520
A treasure chest
filled with pirate gold?

40:48.589 --> 40:51.273
Human remains?

40:52.860 --> 40:54.693
Let me know

40:54.779 --> 40:56.612
when he's fully under.

40:56.697 --> 41:00.315
Or will he find
that Oak Island's secrets

41:00.401 --> 41:04.486
really are protected
by a deadly curse?

41:04.572 --> 41:06.739
He's under.

41:06.824 --> 41:08.824
Janine, can you hear me?

41:08.909 --> 41:11.326
I can hear you.
Can you hear me?

41:11.412 --> 41:14.246
Do we have communications?

41:15.883 --> 41:19.168
Michael, do you copy?

41:19.253 --> 41:20.969
Janine, can you hear me?

41:28.512 --> 41:31.313
Next time
on The Curse of Oak Island...

41:32.850 --> 41:34.817
-Up.
- Harvey's in the shaft,

41:34.902 --> 41:36.318
all by himself,
no way to communicate.

41:36.437 --> 41:37.703
We don't know where he's at.

41:37.805 --> 41:39.905
Did you ever see him?

41:39.940 --> 41:43.141
-JOHN: How long has he been
in now? - 32 minutes.

41:43.244 --> 41:45.210
-Ah. This is a big hit.

41:45.312 --> 41:48.397
-Do you want to dig it?
-What's that? Oh, wow.

41:48.499 --> 41:50.816
Here's what you've b
waiting for, gentlemen.

41:50.935 --> 41:52.634
All right, let's see it.

41:52.686 --> 41:54.136
Whoa! What is it?

41:54.238 --> 41:56.405
-A Roman sword.
-That is phenomenal.
