LYNCH:
Koji Kimura.

03:21.766 --> 03:23.507
According to Tokyo PD,

he has racked up serious charges
over the last ten years.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.120
Firearms and assaults,

03:28.164 --> 03:31.123
becoming the top triggerman
for the Nozawa clan.

03:31.167 --> 03:34.692
That's Kimura with Reiji Nozawa,
boss of the Nozawa clan.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.781
Nozawa Sr. passed away
five years ago,

03:36.825 --> 03:38.827
leaving Junior to
inherit the throne.

03:38.870 --> 03:42.178
Kimura's served as his most
trusted bodyguard ever since.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.181
A few months ago, Tokyo PD
was about to arrest Kimura,

03:45.225 --> 03:47.531
but he fled to L.A.,
thinking he could hide out here.

Ain't no hiding from SWAT.Got that right.

03:49.577 --> 03:50.708

has requested

03:50.752 --> 03:52.971
that Kimura be
extradited immediately.

03:53.015 --> 03:54.886
And since the commander here has

03:54.930 --> 03:56.714
a preexisting relationship
with them, he'll be serving

03:56.758 --> 03:59.151

liaison officer.

take down the Nozawa clan.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.290
Officer Tan.

36:47.248 --> 36:52.993
My grandfather fought the
Chinese during the World War II.

36:53.036 --> 36:55.125
I am embarrassed to say

36:55.169 --> 36:58.564
I let his attitude
become mine with you.

36:58.607 --> 37:00.174
I am deeply sorry.

37:01.741 --> 37:04.004
You are an
exceptional officer.

37:04.047 --> 37:06.224
My city is your city.

37:06.267 --> 37:08.313
You are always welcome.

37:11.533 --> 37:13.056
Thank you, Inspector.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.623
You ever come to L.A.,

37:14.667 --> 37:16.625
drinks are on me.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.936
I guess old dogs like us
can learn new tricks.

37:22.979 --> 37:24.981
[laughs softly]

37:28.855 --> 37:30.291
LYNCH:
Okay.

37:30.335 --> 37:32.293
Any idea how much
a police chopper

37:32.337 --> 37:34.077
costs to operate per hour?

37:34.121 --> 37:36.079
$500?

37:36.123 --> 37:37.080
Try $9,000.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.995
You ever meet Hideo Nomo?No.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.258
But I once did
an undercover sting

37:40.301 --> 37:41.781
in a Dodger's Stadium bathroom.

37:43.130 --> 37:45.263
I just hope you are excited,
young man,

37:45.306 --> 37:48.527
because you are gonna be
throwing out the first pitch.

37:48.570 --> 37:49.876
[both chuckle]

37:53.445 --> 37:57.100
Do you know how much that bat
is gonna cost the department?

37:57.144 --> 38:01.279
Kimura's in custody, so the ends
justify the means, right?

38:01.322 --> 38:06.153
Before you go making crazy
promises again, just ask first.

38:06.196 --> 38:09.548
Please?Right, right. Thanks.

38:11.593 --> 38:15.075
Uh, Lieutenant,
this is my brother Terry.

38:15.118 --> 38:16.946
Hey, nice to meet you. Hey.Hi.

38:16.990 --> 38:19.035
So, uh, what do beers there
cost now?

38:19.079 --> 38:20.341
TERRY:
14 bucks.

38:20.385 --> 38:21.734
And that's domestic.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.997
Ooh. Luca, you're buying
for your brother.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.173
And that's an order.

38:26.216 --> 38:27.261
Got it.

38:29.872 --> 38:32.353
Dad told me about
your hip surgery.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.050
Sounded major.

38:34.094 --> 38:35.269
How you healing?

38:35.313 --> 38:36.357
It's coming along.

38:36.401 --> 38:37.445
You know?

38:37.489 --> 38:39.012
Yeah, I'm glad you came.

38:39.055 --> 38:40.405
Glad you called.

38:40.448 --> 38:43.103
It's been a long time.

38:43.146 --> 38:46.019
Sorry about what I said to you,

38:46.062 --> 38:47.803
you know, last Thanksgiving.

38:47.847 --> 38:51.067
Look, you save people's
lives, I film crime scenes

38:51.111 --> 38:52.678
and then sell them
to the tabloids.

38:52.721 --> 38:55.115
It's no secret who's got
the more honorable gig.

38:55.158 --> 38:56.812
Haven't seen
one of these

38:56.856 --> 38:59.728
since Dad took us up
when we were kids, right?

38:59.772 --> 39:01.034
Yeah, I know, man.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.559
Terry.

39:04.603 --> 39:07.562
What do you say
we let bygones be bygones

39:07.606 --> 39:10.086
and you give me a hand
getting into this bird?

39:10.130 --> 39:11.436
Yeah, all right.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.133
[grunts]You good?

39:13.176 --> 39:14.395
Thanks, bro.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.745
Now get in or we're gonna
be late to the game.

39:18.791 --> 39:19.922
I was about to text you.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.403
Listen, I, um...

39:22.447 --> 39:24.884
I know you've been through
an awful thing,

39:24.927 --> 39:26.668
but if you're gonna
break up with me,

39:26.712 --> 39:28.931
do me a favor
and just get it over with.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.150
That is the last thing I want.

39:30.193 --> 39:32.065
Then why do you keep
pulling away?

39:36.286 --> 39:39.115
You've always had a family
that you could rely on,

39:39.159 --> 39:41.117
that was there for you.

39:41.161 --> 39:43.946
Growing up without one,
I guess I-I just,

39:43.990 --> 39:46.209
I got used to getting
through stuff on my own.

39:46.253 --> 39:48.821
Jim...And I'm not the
"misery loves company" type.

39:48.864 --> 39:51.693
I just, I didn't want
to drag you down into all this.

39:51.737 --> 39:53.956
You're such an idiot.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.394
That's the point of
being with somebody.

39:56.437 --> 39:58.657
It means you don't have
to face the pain alone.

39:59.701 --> 40:00.746
Okay.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.231
I know.

40:08.275 --> 40:10.451
You just didn't let me
get to that part yet.

40:10.495 --> 40:13.236
[helicopter whirring]

40:15.978 --> 40:17.763
You want to take a ride?

40:17.806 --> 40:19.808
Love to.

40:22.594 --> 40:24.117
[engine starts]

40:27.860 --> 40:29.470
We should've never
started this.

40:29.514 --> 40:30.993
It's too late now.

40:48.010 --> 40:48.968
[ringing]

40:49.011 --> 40:50.448
HONDO:
Hey, baby.

40:50.491 --> 40:52.928
[laughs softly]

40:52.972 --> 40:54.495
Hey.

40:54.539 --> 40:58.847
You do realize
it's 4:00 in the morning here.

40:58.891 --> 41:00.501
Oh, I totally forgot.
You were sleeping.

41:00.545 --> 41:01.633
Go back to bed.

41:01.676 --> 41:04.287
No. I'm glad you called.

41:05.637 --> 41:07.508
Look at you,
all sleepy beautiful.

41:07.552 --> 41:09.902
I like that.

41:09.945 --> 41:13.340
You want to see something else
pretty beautiful?

41:13.383 --> 41:15.429
Check this out.

41:17.823 --> 41:19.738
You read my book.

41:19.781 --> 41:21.130
Yes, I did.

41:21.174 --> 41:23.742
Also got you a souvenir.

41:23.785 --> 41:25.308
You ever had a Tokyo Banana?

41:25.352 --> 41:27.180
Mm, that as nasty as it sounds?

41:27.223 --> 41:29.138
Guess you just gonna have
to wait and find out.

41:29.182 --> 41:31.140
[sighs]

41:31.184 --> 41:32.141
I've been thinking about you.

41:32.185 --> 41:33.316
Oh, yeah?

41:33.360 --> 41:36.537
Care to extrapolate
on these thoughts?

41:36.581 --> 41:38.931
I think you're gonna have
to wait on those, too.

41:38.974 --> 41:40.889
I got about an hour[chuckles]

41:40.933 --> 41:43.413
before I have to go to
the airport to catch my flight.

41:43.457 --> 41:45.241
You want to give me
a FaceTime tour of Tokyo?

41:45.285 --> 41:48.854
Sure. Flip the camera around,
show me where you are.

41:51.247 --> 41:53.554
Oh, you're there.

41:53.598 --> 41:56.557
Of course I am.
I listen to my girl.

41:56.601 --> 41:58.124
And, baby, you were right.

41:58.167 --> 41:59.821
That thing
is all the way orange.

41:59.865 --> 42:00.996
Uh-huh.
[chuckles]

42:01.040 --> 42:02.389
Okay, so,

42:02.432 --> 42:05.914
a couple of friends and I
got lost one night

42:05.958 --> 42:09.222
and we ended up there
with no cash, no credit card

42:09.265 --> 42:11.006
and no idea how
to find our way home.
