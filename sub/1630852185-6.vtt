WEBVTT

00:04.255 --> 00:05.381
and we change the world.

00:05.464 --> 00:10.219
Every penny from every copy sold is gonna
go straight to help the war on drugs.

00:10.302 --> 00:12.179
Uncle Charlie!
What are you doing here?

00:12.263 --> 00:15.599
You know you asked me to keep an eye
on that journalist, Ed Pleasance.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.518
I just found out where
he was getting his information.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.103
[Cray] It's two days until the launch,

00:19.186 --> 00:21.272
and the programming team is
expecting you in Amsterdam.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.274
- I want you to come with me.
- I thought you wanted me here.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.444
Right now,
I wanna keep you close, Charlie.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.196
We need protection against Damian Cray.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.700
SCORPIA are targeting
the president of the United States.

00:32.783 --> 00:35.953
Because Damian Cray wants them to.

01:00.186 --> 01:03.731
[Jones] The CIA and Secret Service
will take perimeter positions.

01:04.356 --> 01:07.818
The usual security detail
will be on the president herself.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.820
They also want
our agents inside the house

01:09.904 --> 01:11.864
covering the dinner
in case of any chatter.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.074
Cray's happy with this?

01:14.575 --> 01:17.495
- Joe Byrne didn't give him much choice.
- Nor us.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.040
Well, we're all on the same side. Right?

01:22.333 --> 01:25.336
Tell Crawley to take care
of security arrangements.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.088
Mrs. Jones.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.217
Alex Rider.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.469
Have you spoken to him?

01:34.053 --> 01:36.597
Yes, I have.
And since then, he's gone missing.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.934
He seems to have got wind
of the fact that we were tracking him.

01:40.017 --> 01:44.021
Right. Well, perhaps he's a better agent
than we give him credit for.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.565
Don't let your sympathy
get the better of your judgment.

01:46.649 --> 01:50.027
The last thing we need is Alex Rider
blundering into the middle of this one.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.947
I thought I'd made that clear
to him, but, uh...

01:53.030 --> 01:56.617
if he does happen
to get in touch, let me know.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.868
Of course.

02:07.545 --> 02:08.629
Did you tell him?

02:09.171 --> 02:10.172
About what?

02:10.256 --> 02:11.715
About Alex in Amsterdam.

02:14.552 --> 02:18.222
He asked me to let him know
if he got in touch, not where he was.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.182
Our focus now is the president,

02:20.266 --> 02:22.810
and the president is coming to London,
not Amsterdam.

02:22.893 --> 02:25.938
So, wherever Alex is,
whatever Alex is doing,

02:26.021 --> 02:27.398
he can handle himself.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.546
I'm guessing this is the part of town
they don't put on the postcards.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.924
It was cheap,
and we're not here to look at the view.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.175
Yeah, just as well, 'cause...

03:36.258 --> 03:37.259
This is us.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.398
Nice.

03:51.482 --> 03:52.733
Is it just the one room?

03:52.816 --> 03:55.486
It's cash, it's not traceable,
and it's what we can afford.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.947
Yeah, no, it's good. Really.
It's got character.

03:59.907 --> 04:03.452
So how... how are we gonna do this?

04:03.535 --> 04:04.453
Do what?

04:04.536 --> 04:06.372
You know, the boys and the...

04:08.958 --> 04:10.167
Boys and the girls thing.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.836
"Boys and the girls"?

04:13.837 --> 04:15.089
Seriously, he has a girlfriend?

04:15.172 --> 04:16.298
No, I don't mean it like that.

04:16.382 --> 04:19.551
And it's not my problem.
I'm-I'm fine. I'm fine.

04:19.635 --> 04:22.388
I'm just saying that, you know,
we're all in one room,

04:22.471 --> 04:25.057
and there's three of us, and there's...

04:27.893 --> 04:29.144
- No, I'm fine.
- [Kyra] Okay.

04:29.812 --> 04:32.731
This side is boys. This side is girls.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.609
Everyone try to contain their hormones,

04:35.693 --> 04:38.278
and maybe we'll get through
this ordeal okay.

04:38.362 --> 04:39.613
Yeah.

04:39.697 --> 04:42.700
Yeah, don't worry.
We're not gonna be here long.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.374
[inaudible dialogue]

04:56.547 --> 04:58.757
- Is the plane ready?
- Yes.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.801
I want you to fly to Amsterdam.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.470
Check the code over,
make sure it's ready.

05:03.554 --> 05:05.931
I'll come later,
once we're set up here.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.183
What about Charlie?

05:08.267 --> 05:09.810
He's traveling with me.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.395
That's not what I meant.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.567
He already talked to a journalist.
He already got some boy to steal evidence.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.778
- There was no evidence on the game drive.
- That's not the point.

05:20.446 --> 05:24.616
Charlie clearly thought there was.
Where was he going to take it?

05:25.576 --> 05:28.203
What next? We can't just ignore this.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.122
We're not going to.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.378
I'll talk to him.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.965
He deserves that much.

05:41.383 --> 05:45.262
[Alex] Cray's research facility is here,

05:45.345 --> 05:46.889
right in the middle of nowhere.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.808
The missing parts of the game code
are in there somewhere,

05:49.892 --> 05:51.477
hidden on his computer servers.

05:51.560 --> 05:55.731
We need to get in, find the missing data,
and get out without being caught.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.233
- And make a copy so we can prove it.
- Yeah.

05:58.317 --> 06:00.652
Okay, so how do we get in?
Cut the fence?

06:00.736 --> 06:02.613
There isn't a fence. Look.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.324
There's one road in and out.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.829
No wall, no fence,
no razor wire, nothing.

06:10.913 --> 06:12.247
No way it's that easy.

06:12.331 --> 06:13.665
That's what I'm thinking.

06:13.749 --> 06:16.585
So there is something,
but we don't know what.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.253
How do you plan for that?

06:19.254 --> 06:22.132
We should check it out before we go in
to find out what we're dealing with.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.218
I'd like to see this guardhouse up close.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.428
And I'd like to know
what's in these fields.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.847
Then we regroup, decide on a plan.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.849
You know what this is, right?

06:32.434 --> 06:33.685
It's a heist movie.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.189
Assemble the team, scope out the target,

06:37.272 --> 06:40.984
plan the heist, practice
until we're a well-oiled machine.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.863
But instead of, like, stealing diamonds
or casino takings or priceless art,

06:44.947 --> 06:46.824
it's Damian Cray's game code.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.576
Okay. Heist movie it is.

06:50.869 --> 06:54.915
It looks like we're in the home stretch
of Cray's charity acquisition.

06:54.998 --> 06:58.585
I had the chair of the
East London Rehab Center on the phone,

06:58.669 --> 07:00.963
saying that they are prepared to go ahead.

07:01.547 --> 07:04.967
Obviously, this means
due diligence on our part,

07:05.050 --> 07:07.261
trolling through a ton of paperwork.

07:07.344 --> 07:11.431
Cray's people are very keen for us to
get this finished by the end of the day.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.560
- Why the rush?
- It comes from the top.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.729
There are several
of these charity acquisitions happening,

07:17.813 --> 07:19.940
and Mr. Cray wants them all concluded

07:20.023 --> 07:22.651
before he has his dinner
with the president.

07:23.777 --> 07:27.906
So, they'll be expecting you
at his headquarters

07:27.990 --> 07:29.741
first thing this afternoon.

07:29.825 --> 07:33.620
- This after...
- Don't let us down.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.750
[Jones] We're still coordinating
the details with Cray's team.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.628
But this is what we have right now.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.966
Two teams, as you agreed,

07:46.049 --> 07:49.261
plus Cray's staff,
plus the president's own detail.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.514
Good. Nobody's getting through there.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.516
By the time we're done,

07:54.600 --> 07:57.144
Cray's house will be locked down
tighter than Camp David.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.145
[Blunt] Mm.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.023
There's an inherent fallacy in believing

08:01.106 --> 08:04.401
because you've barred all the windows
and locked all the doors that you're safe.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.653
It assumes your enemy's on the outside.

08:07.154 --> 08:11.783
SCORPIA have extraordinary resources,
reach, determination.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.369
They can compromise, they can coerce.

08:14.453 --> 08:17.831
The personnel have been cleared
by our State Department.

08:20.876 --> 08:23.962
Yes, you'll forgive me
if I'm not entirely satisfied.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.383
We'll do our own background checks.

08:28.467 --> 08:29.968
Personal contacts, finance,

08:30.052 --> 08:33.889
phone records, online activity,
everything, from top to bottom.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.119
There it is.

08:57.913 --> 08:58.956
[Tom] That's it.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.459
I don't know. Looks a bit freaky, right?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.211
[Kyra] Looks like you could walk right in.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.921
Yeah, we're not falling for that.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.342
Me and Kyra. You sure
that's the best way to do this?

09:10.425 --> 09:11.468
Suck it up.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.929
You guys will do fine.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.597
See you on the other side.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.650
Mrs. Jones, Mr. Crawley, good morning.

09:27.359 --> 09:30.654
Has someone offered you
some tea, coffee, breakfast?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.781
- We're fine, thank you, Mr. Cray.
- Good.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.118
- May we have access to your roof?
- Uh...

09:37.077 --> 09:41.164
Yeah, sure. What are you worried about?
Sniper? Is that very likely?

09:42.582 --> 09:45.085
Between the president
leaving the car and entering the building,

09:45.168 --> 09:47.379
there could be maybe five or six seconds.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.423
A trained sniper would have a chance.

09:49.506 --> 09:53.302
It's an awkward shot but, uh...
you could do it.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.722
Sean Palmer, head of security.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.140
Good to meet you.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.183
I'd like to talk to you about your staff.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.268
What about them?

10:01.351 --> 10:04.521
We'd like to run further background checks
just to rule out all contingencies.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.565
My people are sound.
I picked them myself.

10:06.648 --> 10:09.109
Don't worry. Sean will give you
everything you need.

10:09.192 --> 10:12.321
In fact, he'll be liaising directly
with you while I'm in Amsterdam.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.530
Amsterdam?

10:14.031 --> 10:15.198
Briefly, yes.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.616
When will you be back?

10:18.535 --> 10:19.953
Uh, 24 hours.

10:20.037 --> 10:23.206
Don't worry, I'll be back in plenty
of time to meet and greet the guests.

10:23.290 --> 10:27.210
It's just the usual checks
ahead of a big software launch.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.589
Your new game is coming out the same night
you have dinner with the president?

10:30.672 --> 10:32.716
Well, it's all part of
the same initiative.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.469
The sales of the game
help fund the war on drugs,

10:35.552 --> 10:38.805
and the charity dinner helps
focus the minds of the world's elite.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.351
Now if you'll excuse me,
Sean'll take it from here.

10:43.810 --> 10:44.644
Shall we?

10:55.614 --> 10:56.740
Um...

10:56.823 --> 10:59.993
Goedemorgen.
We're a little bit lost, mate.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.620
- [horn honks]
- Move, please.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.789
- Oh, yeah, sure. No worries.
- [vehicle approaching]

11:27.270 --> 11:28.855
[men speaking Dutch]

11:52.671 --> 11:53.630
Perfect.

12:02.472 --> 12:03.432
You need to go.

12:04.015 --> 12:07.102
This is private land.
You and your girlfriend need to leave.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.646
- She's not my girlfriend.
- I'm really not.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.898
Look, we're not really lost.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.733
We wanted to see
where Feathered Serpent's made.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.110
You know, where the magic happens.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.697
Wait right there.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.664
There you go. Now leave.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.291
Yep.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.252
Danke.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.927
"An awkward shot," you said.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.847
Special Forces?

12:46.224 --> 12:48.059
Eight years in F Squadron.

12:49.769 --> 12:50.770
SAS?

12:51.980 --> 12:53.106
What happened?

12:53.732 --> 12:54.900
Invalided out.

12:56.359 --> 12:59.321
There was an IED,
I caught some of the fragments.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.489
I'm sorry.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.908
Don't be. The money's a lot better.

13:03.492 --> 13:06.578
And I never have to eat
another MRE pack in my life.

13:10.874 --> 13:11.708
And you?

13:13.627 --> 13:15.253
Where were you?

13:16.338 --> 13:19.883
I wasn't anywhere.
I just work, uh, in an office.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.679
If you say so.

13:25.764 --> 13:28.016
[Crawley] And these are all your people?

13:29.768 --> 13:32.229
Whatever you're looking for,
you won't find it here.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.107
I trust my team with my life.
You should too.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.957
[Cray] I expected scrutiny,
but not this level of scrutiny.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.627
MI6 have agents everywhere.

13:55.710 --> 13:58.171
In the house, in the grounds,

13:58.255 --> 14:00.840
surface-to-air missile on the roof.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.301
They're looking into everything.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.888
I need a smooth run with the game launch
and the charity supper,

14:06.972 --> 14:08.974
but they're getting in my way.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.769
[Yassen] They're not MI6.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.606
They work for a man called Alan Blunt.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.901
His department is separate.

14:20.944 --> 14:25.448
MI6 keep him in a back room
and only let him out when they're scared.

14:25.532 --> 14:29.619
I have no room for interference,
no room for error.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.664
The president arrives tomorrow.
Everything has to be perfect.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.624
That is why you engaged SCORPIA.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.586
To make sure.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.006
Proceed as planned.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.507
Go to Amsterdam.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.386
Leave the department to me.

15:04.738 --> 15:05.614
[Byrne] A word?

15:06.448 --> 15:07.407
[Blunt] Of course.

15:23.006 --> 15:26.593
You said SCORPIA
can compromise and coerce.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.846
That they have incredible reach.

15:32.349 --> 15:36.853
And I can't help wondering
if this comes from personal experience.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.986
Was the department
compromised by SCORPIA?

15:45.779 --> 15:48.114
You can't possibly expect
an answer to that question.

15:48.198 --> 15:51.117
Well, I thought we were
being honest with each other.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.202
To a point.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.789
The fact is...

15:56.665 --> 16:01.336
my department has been on the frontline
of this fight from the very beginning.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.799
We have a unique insight.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.969
At what cost?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.234
So, what'd you guys get?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.861
Mainly weirded out.
Gate guard thought we were a couple.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.072
Why is it weirding you out?
You should be so lucky.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.323
Actually, I am so lucky.

16:30.407 --> 16:31.825
You sure Steph's actually your girlfriend?

16:31.908 --> 16:33.702
- She didn't just lose a bet?
- Guys.

16:35.453 --> 16:36.788
We got baseball caps.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.166
I was kind of hoping for something
a little bit more useful.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.212
- Let's see, shall we?
- Nice.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.216
Good stuff. Cool.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.639
[Charlie] Why exactly
do you need me in Amsterdam?

16:55.140 --> 16:57.225
[Cray] I wanted a chance to talk to you.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.562
I owe you an apology, Charlie.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.066
I had no idea that you
and the journalist were so close.

17:06.234 --> 17:09.195
Ed Pleasance.
The man in the gas explosion.

17:11.072 --> 17:13.825
I know you knew him.
You don't have to hide it from me.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.871
Look, I know he was writing
something critical about me.

17:18.580 --> 17:21.291
I'm a billionaire.
Comes with the territory.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.418
But that doesn't mean
I wouldn't have cared

17:23.501 --> 17:25.336
if I knew that a friend of yours
had been hurt.

17:25.420 --> 17:28.214
He used to be my friend. We lost touch.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.800
Then you got back in touch, didn't you?

17:32.427 --> 17:34.012
You talked to him.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.638
Instead of talking to me.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.767
And, uh, I don't know, maybe he...

17:39.809 --> 17:42.979
filled your head with conspiracy theories.

17:43.062 --> 17:47.942
And you wanted to see for yourself,
so you hired some kid to steal the game.

17:48.026 --> 17:48.860
I didn't.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.279
I never hired the kid.
Uh, I don't even know him.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.447
It doesn't matter.

17:53.490 --> 17:54.949
What matters is...

17:56.242 --> 17:58.578
that you felt that
you had to go behind my back.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.206
You felt that
I was hiding something from you.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.083
And I truly am sorry for that

18:04.167 --> 18:08.004
because it means that I lost your trust
somewhere along the way.

18:12.634 --> 18:13.635
Look...

18:15.595 --> 18:18.181
I never wanted
to work for a games company.

18:18.807 --> 18:22.101
I wanted to work for you.
Because you're different.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.855
You wanted to make
the world a better place.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.735
- Is that still what you want?
- Yes.

18:32.779 --> 18:33.780
Yes, it is.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.950
And I'm gonna prove it to you.

18:39.035 --> 18:42.247
And then you can decide for yourself
whether you wanna stay with me

18:42.330 --> 18:43.873
or whether you wanna walk.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.792
It's your call.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.758
This is private land. You and...

18:53.842 --> 18:55.218
To the right.

18:56.177 --> 18:58.096
So there's laser mesh
all around the place.

18:58.179 --> 19:01.432
If we try to walk in, they're gonna know
about it as soon as we cross the beams.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.268
And there's nowhere to hide.

19:03.351 --> 19:06.271
Plus, there's cameras
on the outside of the facility walls.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.022
Maybe infrared for night.

19:09.107 --> 19:11.609
They don't have a fence
'cause they don't need a fence.

19:11.693 --> 19:12.735
So how do we get in?

19:13.361 --> 19:14.779
They have keycards.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.114
The delivery driver used one.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.657
What, you think any delivery guy

19:17.740 --> 19:20.243
could just card his way to all
the secrets Cray's keeping in there?

19:20.326 --> 19:24.205
No, because that would be stupid.
But the cards will be on a system.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.499
Level one grunt opens a few areas
through to boss level,

19:26.583 --> 19:27.792
which opens everything.

19:28.877 --> 19:30.545
We're gonna need boss-level access.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.132
So you guys get to be bosses,
running around Cray's facility,

19:34.215 --> 19:38.094
and I get to, what now,
sit outside and watch?

19:38.177 --> 19:40.513
I wouldn't have either of you in there
if I didn't have to.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.473
Computers are kind of Kyra's thing.

19:42.557 --> 19:43.391
Yeah, I get that.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.061
My thing is waiting in a field.

19:47.145 --> 19:49.397
You're gonna need to have our backs.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.524
None of this is gonna matter

19:51.608 --> 19:53.526
if we can't get through
the front door in the first place.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.072
Let's go back.

19:58.907 --> 20:01.910
[man speaking Dutch on video]

20:06.873 --> 20:09.125
What does he say there, after "okay"?

20:12.378 --> 20:13.630
[man speaks Dutch]

20:16.341 --> 20:17.967
"See you this afternoon."

20:22.597 --> 20:25.600
playing over headphones]

20:34.984 --> 20:37.904
- [speaking Dutch]
- How much are the phones?

20:37.987 --> 20:40.365
Ah... thirty euros each.

20:40.448 --> 20:42.492
- Uh, do you take card?
- Sure.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.118
Can I have three?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.245
[speaking Dutch]

20:49.165 --> 20:52.210
Actually, I think I have enough cash.

20:53.670 --> 20:54.504
Yeah.

20:58.299 --> 21:00.551
- I love your hair, by the way.
- Thanks.

21:14.232 --> 21:15.566
[speaking indistinctly]

21:28.997 --> 21:29.956
All right?

21:31.833 --> 21:33.126
All good?

21:33.668 --> 21:35.753
Travel card.
Four euros on it, apparently.

21:35.837 --> 21:37.296
Nice. These are for you.

21:37.380 --> 21:40.800
Numbers are in already.
But that was the last of the cash.

21:40.883 --> 21:44.137
- What about boss-level access?
- Cheat codes.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.180
Cool. Then we're all set.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.267
No, the next step is to practice
until we're a well-oiled machine.

21:49.350 --> 21:52.729
There's no time. Whatever's gonna happen
happens tomorrow, remember?

21:54.188 --> 21:57.442
This is not a funny movie,
not a cool game with your friend.

21:57.525 --> 22:00.737
You're safe outside.
We're not. Don't screw this up.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.990
Yeah, I wasn't planning on it.

22:24.719 --> 22:25.553
[complains in Dutch]

22:29.932 --> 22:32.894
[horn honking]

22:37.523 --> 22:39.400
[complains in Dutch]

22:43.863 --> 22:45.406
[tires screeching]

22:45.490 --> 22:46.699
Oh, oh, oh.

22:47.533 --> 22:48.868
You okay?

22:48.951 --> 22:50.495
[Tom] Yeah. Yeah.

22:50.578 --> 22:53.331
Engels? What happened?
You need a doctor?

22:53.414 --> 22:54.791
[Tom] No, no, I just...

22:54.874 --> 22:57.043
These are quite hard
to get used to, aren't they?

22:57.126 --> 22:58.127
What are you doing?

22:58.211 --> 23:00.046
You need to watch
where you're going with this.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.881
You just came out of nowhere.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.342
[man] What is this? I'm nowhere near you.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.427
[Tom] Yeah, well, all I'm saying is

23:06.511 --> 23:09.180
I didn't just fall off my bike
for no reason, did I?

23:09.263 --> 23:11.599
Yeah, and all I'm saying is
you're weaving all over the road.

23:11.682 --> 23:14.018
You fall over. It's nothing to do with me.

23:14.102 --> 23:18.272
Yeah? Well, maybe you're right.
Maybe you're wrong.

23:18.356 --> 23:20.024
Maybe I call the police.

23:20.108 --> 23:23.319
No, no, no! No need to involve the police.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.113
I remember now. It's all coming back.

23:25.196 --> 23:28.741
I was cycling, and you're right,
I didn't-- I just fell. I just fell.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.702
You were miles away. You were
nowhere near me, I was gonna say.

23:31.786 --> 23:34.997
But, you know, anyway, my arms
are all working, legs are good.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.374
I'm good, you're good.

23:36.457 --> 23:37.959
- [man] You're sure you're fine?
- Yeah.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.961
Everything all right in the head?
The marbles okay?

23:40.044 --> 23:41.671
Yeah. That's why
I wear my helmet, yeah.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.506
- [man] You're certainly fine?
- [Tom] Yeah, all good.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.091
- [man] All over, you're fine?
- I'm good.

23:45.174 --> 23:46.008
[man] You're fine.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.468
- I teach you a Dutch word.
- Okay.

23:47.552 --> 23:48.803
[speaking Dutch]

23:48.886 --> 23:50.763
- Dwas?
- Yeah, it means "fool."

23:50.847 --> 23:52.265
- Oh.
- That means you.

23:52.807 --> 23:54.684
- [Tom] Okay.
- [man] You won't forget this word.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.435
- Okay.
- Pick up your bike.

23:56.519 --> 23:58.020
- Be on your way.
- Okay, mate.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.148
- [man] Yeah. Stay to the side.
- [Tom] Yes.

24:00.231 --> 24:03.151
- Don't fall in the canal.
- Yes, I will-- I won't. I won't.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.068
Nutcase.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.364
Silly bugger.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.645
[horn toots]

24:43.316 --> 24:45.985
- Hey, Mickey, pickup.
- What are you thinking, eh?

25:04.420 --> 25:05.755
Looking very professional.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.506
Feeling very professional.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.300
- Mr. Williams.
- [Dan] Hey.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.970
And you must be Miss Starbright.
I'm Julia Moss.

25:13.054 --> 25:14.263
Pleased to meet you.

25:14.889 --> 25:18.059
I was told you needed to go over the files
for the Rehab Center acquisition?

25:18.142 --> 25:19.268
That's right.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.312
I should warn you,
there's a lot of boxes.

25:21.395 --> 25:23.898
And I know the pressure's on
to get this completed today.

25:23.981 --> 25:26.734
- The sooner we get started, the better.
- Okay.

25:30.905 --> 25:33.908
[indistinct chatter]

25:38.287 --> 25:39.580
[beeps]

25:41.832 --> 25:43.084
[elevator bell dings]

26:50.318 --> 26:51.819
What do you think all this stuff is?

26:52.737 --> 26:56.657
I don't know. Whatever they're
shipping out. Copies of the game?

26:56.741 --> 26:58.576
[Alex] Says it's going to London.

26:58.659 --> 27:01.704
Priority mail, arriving this evening.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.669
Kyra?

27:09.837 --> 27:11.422
What is that?

27:12.214 --> 27:16.052
A hazmat suit.
Like, for radiation and chemical spills.

27:17.178 --> 27:18.304
There's a lot of them.

27:18.387 --> 27:22.141
Why does a software company need
something for chemicals and radiation?

27:22.224 --> 27:23.142
Yeah.

27:23.225 --> 27:25.061
- [alarm blaring]
- Alex, card.

27:25.728 --> 27:28.731
[automated voice]
Commencing server throughput test.

27:28.814 --> 27:29.899
Boss level.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.735
Commencing server throughput test.

27:33.361 --> 27:34.653
[elevator bell dings]

27:34.737 --> 27:37.114
[automated voice continues in Dutch]

27:43.704 --> 27:46.916
- [distorted voice] Report.
- I need to activate an identity.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.168
Thomas Ashton.

27:50.211 --> 27:54.423
Flight documents, passport.
And I need funds.

27:55.466 --> 27:56.550
What amount?

27:56.634 --> 27:58.844
6.5 million, sterling.

28:00.429 --> 28:03.140
- What purpose?
- Payment.

28:03.849 --> 28:06.644
For killing the president
of the United States.

28:11.190 --> 28:14.026
[Smithers] We can't find any links
between Cray's security staff and SCORPIA.

28:15.945 --> 28:18.489
There's nothing in the phone records
or the text messages.

28:18.989 --> 28:20.658
What about bank accounts?

28:20.741 --> 28:25.079
Cray pays well enough,
but everything's clean, above-board.

28:25.955 --> 28:27.873
No hidden accounts that I could find.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.835
Then we need to reverse-engineer it.

28:32.128 --> 28:33.671
What else do we have on SCORPIA?

28:33.754 --> 28:34.755
Well...

28:36.215 --> 28:38.259
back in the day, there were
anti-money laundering traces

28:38.342 --> 28:40.719
on a bunch of suspicious accounts.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.889
But they've been dormant for years.

28:44.974 --> 28:46.183
Wake them up.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.451
There's no cameras in here.

29:04.577 --> 29:06.871
Maybe all the security's on the outside.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.372
[woman speaking Dutch]

29:13.961 --> 29:17.590
Okay. We need to find
a terminal with server access.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.467
That's something a programmer
would use, right?

29:19.550 --> 29:20.676
Right.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.428
So we follow the programmers.

29:30.019 --> 29:31.020
[Evelyn] You. Wait.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.023
What's the latest on the transfer rates?

29:34.106 --> 29:36.775
Fourteen percent improvement
over the previous order.

29:36.859 --> 29:38.944
Fourteen percent? I want 20.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.071
We can't manage 20.

29:41.155 --> 29:44.241
Run it again and again
and again until we can.

29:44.950 --> 29:48.454
Go get the whole team
in the programming suite. Everyone.

29:49.246 --> 29:51.707
- [Kyra] Programming suite, shit.
- [Alex] What is that?

29:51.790 --> 29:55.085
Stupid open-plan trendy software bullshit.

29:55.169 --> 29:57.796
Everyone in one big room
with foosball tables and hot-desks.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.007
No way we can get in there
without being seen.

30:00.674 --> 30:02.051
So somewhere else.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.887
Cray would have a terminal, right?

30:04.970 --> 30:07.598
- Yeah, I'd say so.
- Let's find Cray's office.

30:16.607 --> 30:17.483
Anything?

30:18.192 --> 30:19.818
No, nothing yet.

30:20.694 --> 30:23.239
Of course,
it's possible there's nothing to find.

30:25.199 --> 30:26.283
Uh...

30:31.539 --> 30:32.706
I'm concerned.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.376
- About what?
- Your boss.

30:37.711 --> 30:41.465
Alan knew months ago
that SCORPIA were active again.

30:42.508 --> 30:43.717
He didn't tell us.

30:45.052 --> 30:49.223
Then I discovered
the department itself was compromised.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.477
We're supposed to be
on the same team here.

30:54.478 --> 30:58.899
So I'm asking myself,
why am I always so late to the party?

31:00.901 --> 31:02.695
As I understand it,

31:02.778 --> 31:06.115
Britain and America
have a special relationship.

31:07.283 --> 31:10.786
And relationships are
sometimes complicated.

31:12.705 --> 31:15.040
But they don't have to be, Mrs. Jones.

31:16.250 --> 31:19.003
And they tend to work better
when they're not.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.340
[computer beeping]

31:23.424 --> 31:25.217
Guys, I think I've got something.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.891
[indistinct chatter]

31:32.975 --> 31:34.435
Kyra? Kyra.

31:49.033 --> 31:50.034
[speaking Dutch]

32:09.887 --> 32:11.263
Hell is this?

32:26.111 --> 32:28.155
Is it a flight simulator?

32:28.989 --> 32:30.741
More like a flight plan.

32:32.701 --> 32:33.661
AF1.

32:35.079 --> 32:37.289
AF1. Air Force One.

32:37.373 --> 32:38.749
The president's plane.

32:40.542 --> 32:43.837
Blunt said SCORPIA were targeting
the president of the United States.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.091
Blunt thinks they're
planning an assassination.

32:47.675 --> 32:48.759
Of the president?

32:50.010 --> 32:53.806
It doesn't make sense.
Why would he need Feathered Serpent?

32:53.889 --> 32:56.141
If he wants to kill the president,
he can just do it.

32:56.809 --> 32:58.018
Yeah, you're right.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.732
Which means whatever Cray's planning,
it's bigger than an assassination.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.780
We looked into Cray's personnel,
as you requested.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.116
Everybody up here is squeaky clean.

33:12.199 --> 33:15.369
So, we tried
the other side of the equation.

33:15.452 --> 33:17.121
Working backwards from SCORPIA.

33:17.204 --> 33:20.374
Exactly. We reactivated flags
on dormant accounts worldwide.

33:20.457 --> 33:21.917
Anyone who we believe has ties

33:22.000 --> 33:24.962
or had ties in the past
to SCORPIA's activities.

33:25.045 --> 33:27.840
We found an AML alert
on this one, right here.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.758
Mothballed for 12 years.

33:29.842 --> 33:34.346
But someone just shuttled
six and a half million pounds through it.

33:34.430 --> 33:37.266
And that money came right here, to London.

33:38.267 --> 33:41.061
To someone named Thomas Ashton.

33:41.687 --> 33:45.607
We found a property rented in that name
not far from Cray's house.

33:46.984 --> 33:48.026
[Blunt] Go.

33:48.610 --> 33:49.820
Go.

33:54.283 --> 33:55.659
Unique insight.

33:57.327 --> 33:58.996
Yes, it came at a cost.

34:00.581 --> 34:02.875
But we may just have found your assassin.

34:06.920 --> 34:07.921
Terminal.

34:08.672 --> 34:12.384
- Can we use this to crack the game code?
- Let's find out.

34:14.428 --> 34:17.347
This is set up
for someone called Evelyn Anders.

34:18.640 --> 34:23.437
She's Cray's chief programmer.
Bet she's got good password security.

34:23.896 --> 34:25.105
Not for long.

34:34.531 --> 34:35.699
[cell phone buzzing]

34:38.076 --> 34:39.536
In your own time, mate.

34:39.620 --> 34:41.288
Kyra's just hacking
the chief programmer's account.

34:41.371 --> 34:44.625
We're gonna try
and get access that way.

34:44.708 --> 34:47.294
I'm taking all her security settings off.

34:48.629 --> 34:50.714
When you say,
"all her security settings"...?

34:50.798 --> 34:54.009
Everything. Globally.
Passwords, software, firewalls.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.302
If you want to start posting

34:55.385 --> 34:58.180
on Evelyn Anders' timeline,
now's your chance.

34:58.263 --> 34:59.139
Awesome.

35:00.140 --> 35:01.058
Game drive.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.401
[Alex] Can you unlock it?

35:13.946 --> 35:15.322
Come on, come on, come on.

35:17.825 --> 35:21.078
Yes, this is it.
This is the hidden code.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.163
Okay? So come on out.

35:23.247 --> 35:24.540
[Kyra] Whoa, there's a lot of it.

35:24.623 --> 35:28.126
Like... like a whole new program
hidden inside.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.129
What does it do?

35:31.672 --> 35:34.424
Uh, this, it's way complex.

35:34.925 --> 35:38.720
It's a whole
totally different instruction set.

35:39.221 --> 35:42.891
It looks like it's made
for all different kinds of computers.

35:42.975 --> 35:46.520
There's old code and new code.
This could take hours to make sense of.

35:46.603 --> 35:48.021
- Yeah, we don't have hours.
- Uh, I know.

35:48.105 --> 35:50.691
Um, I can copy it and look at it properly
when we're out of here.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.359
Do that.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.908
- How long?
- There's a lot of data.

36:01.201 --> 36:03.912
- Kyra, how long?
- Uh, maybe 20 minutes.

36:11.211 --> 36:13.171
Thomas Ashton, armed police!

36:13.255 --> 36:15.799
- Show yourself. Armed police!
- [officer 1] Armed police!

36:15.883 --> 36:17.885
Armed police! Show yourself!

36:17.968 --> 36:19.344
[officer 2] All clear!

36:22.347 --> 36:23.724
Upstairs, clear!

36:24.683 --> 36:26.685
- Search everywhere.
- Yes, sir.

36:31.315 --> 36:32.649
[officer 3]
Boss?

36:33.233 --> 36:35.110
Item of interest downstairs.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.779
Firearm, sir.

36:39.656 --> 36:40.490
[Crawley] Good.

36:54.588 --> 36:55.714
Result.

36:57.007 --> 36:59.843
Come on, come on, come on.

36:59.927 --> 37:01.720
[alarm beeping]

37:08.518 --> 37:09.436
Alex?

37:10.771 --> 37:11.605
Alex?

37:12.356 --> 37:13.982
Alex, can you hear me, Alex?

37:14.775 --> 37:15.901
Yeah. What's up?

37:15.984 --> 37:17.611
Someone's coming.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.658
- Uh, company. We've gotta go.
- We can't. It's not finished.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.618
- [Alex] How long?
- Fourteen minutes.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.203
[Alex] We don't have 14 minutes.

37:26.286 --> 37:28.205
Can you leave it copying
but turn off the screen?

37:28.705 --> 37:31.416
- Yeah.
- Let's do that. Hide your laptop.

37:33.418 --> 37:34.628
Get out of there, now.

37:34.711 --> 37:36.254
It's Cray!

37:36.755 --> 37:39.216
We're just copying the game code.
It's gonna take some time.

37:40.550 --> 37:43.303
- [Tom] He's in the building.
- Yeah, I know. We need the game data.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.222
Fourteen minutes
and we're out of here, okay?

37:55.440 --> 37:56.441
[Kyra] Oh, God.

38:03.782 --> 38:07.411
- [beeps]
- [automated voice] Welcome, Mr. Cray.

38:14.251 --> 38:16.378
I want you to understand, Charlie.

38:18.463 --> 38:19.464
I really do.

38:27.472 --> 38:28.849
[Charlie] What is this?

38:28.932 --> 38:30.058
Years of work.

38:31.268 --> 38:32.644
Years of planning.

38:34.271 --> 38:36.231
It's what lies behind the curtain.

39:08.055 --> 39:10.140
I should have been
honest with you sooner.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.226
But we can start now.

39:17.731 --> 39:18.982
You wanna be honest?

39:20.776 --> 39:22.986
I know you employed Smoking Mirror.

39:23.695 --> 39:24.988
And I know he's dead.

39:26.323 --> 39:28.825
I saw what you did to that kid in London.

39:30.535 --> 39:31.703
Tell me the truth.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.623
Did you hurt Ed?

39:36.583 --> 39:38.335
Did you put him in a coma?

39:50.305 --> 39:52.307
No. I didn't.

39:55.769 --> 39:57.521
But I paid the man who did.

40:08.532 --> 40:09.658
Mr. Crawley.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.411
I wasn't expecting you.

40:14.496 --> 40:15.831
We found the assassin.

40:16.998 --> 40:17.999
Who?

40:18.083 --> 40:19.209
Thomas Ashton.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.462
And Thomas Ashton is you.

40:24.506 --> 40:25.924
[Taser crackling]

41:03.587 --> 41:06.715
My brother's death
could have been prevented.

41:07.883 --> 41:12.512
So could countless others,
if people in power had the will.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.599
Where government fails,

41:16.183 --> 41:18.894
people of good conscience
have not only the right,

41:19.394 --> 41:22.689
but the duty to step in.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.775
Damian, come on.

41:25.859 --> 41:28.111
Some things are bigger than one man.

41:29.112 --> 41:31.990
No matter how decent,
no matter how good,

41:33.408 --> 41:36.036
if hurting one man saves a hundred...

41:37.662 --> 41:39.122
it's worth it, isn't it?

41:40.373 --> 41:41.833
Life isn't like that.

41:43.251 --> 41:46.004
- You don't get to make those decisions.
- Someone has to.

41:48.590 --> 41:50.884
One man's life weighed against a hundred.

41:53.470 --> 41:54.554
How about...

41:55.639 --> 41:58.975
one million people
weighed against a hundred million?

42:00.852 --> 42:01.686
Look...

42:03.230 --> 42:07.150
hacking computers,
stealing data, that's one thing.

42:07.234 --> 42:09.444
But this is so far beyond that.

42:12.030 --> 42:15.283
Now you're talking
like you're reducing people

42:15.367 --> 42:17.911
to numbers in some kind of equation. No.

42:18.870 --> 42:19.871
No way.

42:21.456 --> 42:25.085
People aren't maths.
We're human beings.

42:25.794 --> 42:28.088
And I want no part of it, no part at all.

42:28.672 --> 42:33.301
Whatever this is,
whatever you're planning, I'm out.

42:34.970 --> 42:36.054
I understand.

42:38.932 --> 42:41.017
I wish you felt differently, but...

42:42.602 --> 42:43.728
I understand.

42:45.480 --> 42:47.190
[Charlie] You said I had a choice.

42:48.608 --> 42:50.068
I choose to walk away.

42:54.864 --> 42:56.157
Goodbye, Charlie.

43:04.291 --> 43:05.959
- No! Don't shoot him!
- Alex!

43:08.670 --> 43:09.504
[Cray] You!

43:18.930 --> 43:20.015
Damian, please.

43:21.099 --> 43:22.559
Think about this.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.437
They're just kids.

43:27.981 --> 43:29.357
This isn't who you are.

43:33.695 --> 43:35.447
You have no idea who I am.

43:36.406 --> 43:37.615
No!

43:46.750 --> 43:48.585
[Cray] No escape this time.
