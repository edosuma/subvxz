But bashing chimps
and trying to extrapolate to humans
won't show you anything.

29:17.956 --> 29:21.892
In the Cameroons,
I saw chimps fall from
over 50 feet from trees,

29:21.960 --> 29:24.554
land on their heads
and walk away.

29:24.629 --> 29:27.223
A man could die

29:27.298 --> 29:29.391
The neurological structure
of a chimp's brain...

29:29.467 --> 29:32.061

to review your experiment.

30:26.191 --> 30:28.955

30:29.027 --> 30:33.396
Your research is only valid
if you're designing crash helmets
for chimps.

30:33.464 --> 30:35.955
Doctor, if you'd studied neurology,
you'd know that the data
from my experiments...

30:36.034 --> 30:38.730
is easily extrapolated to humans.

you're still killing chimps

- What gave you the right
to sacrifice one species over another?

30:51.149 --> 30:53.083

Yeah.

36:13.471 --> 36:15.905
It's not over.
We gotta get out of here.

36:15.973 --> 36:18.601
Yeah, but this place
is crawling with security.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.871
First you gotta get
out of the building.
How?

36:20.945 --> 36:24.608
There's a door down here,
but you gotta stay down
because there's three guys here...

36:24.682 --> 36:26.912

All right, here we go.
Give me your hand.

36:26.984 --> 36:29.851
Okay? Low, now.
Low, low, low, low, low.

<i>You to0- Stay down.</i>

36:34.592 --> 36:37.117
<i>[ Tucker ]</i>
<i>How did this happen?</i>

36:37.195 --> 36:40.255
With all due respect, Doctor,
I want to ask you the same question.
Excuse me?

36:40.331 --> 36:42.925
You approved Dr. Winger's experiment.
That's right.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.264
So you know what he's doing
to my chimps.

36:45.336 --> 36:47.429
In the first place, Doctor,
they were never really
your chimps.

36:47.505 --> 36:49.769
No. They feel more like my family.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.434
Well, however you see them,
those animals are here
for research.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.535
Now, I know it's hard
to maintain objectivity,

36:54.612 --> 36:57.775
but you can't get
too attached to these animals.

36:57.848 --> 37:00.942
You want me to forget the fact
that I've been training them
for over two years?

37:01.018 --> 37:04.545
No.Just think of how much good
they'll be doing.

37:04.622 --> 37:06.715
That's not gonna take away
their suffering.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.759
This isn't just about
how much they help us.

37:08.826 --> 37:11.226
It's also about the responsibility
we have to help them.

37:11.295 --> 37:13.559
Animal research is critical
to the work we do here.

37:13.631 --> 37:16.293
There is absolutely no value
to Dr. Winger's research.

37:16.367 --> 37:19.734
Look, Doctor,
you're a veterinarian.

37:19.804 --> 37:21.795
Now, how would you feel
if Dr. Winger...

37:21.872 --> 37:24.238
challenged your training
of the chimps on Project Mercury?

37:24.308 --> 37:27.903
I'm training them to survive.
He's just killing them.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.243
I think his experiment is valid.
I don't agree.

37:30.314 --> 37:32.509
He thinks it's valid
and you don't.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.949

which of you is right?

We gotta get out of here.

38:09.920 --> 38:13.686
Uh, I don't know.
I'm working on it.
Maybe we should try and find Leslie.

38:13.758 --> 38:15.692
Ziggy says she's around somewhere,
looking for you.
I just don't see her-

38:15.760 --> 38:17.352
Where?
<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>to get you off of this base.</i>

38:19.797 --> 38:22.994
- What if we go that way?
- No, you can't go that way.
There's a runway over there.

38:23.067 --> 38:26.230
Well, what are we gonna do, Al?
We gotta get out of here.
I don't know. I'm working on it.

Listen, I'm gonna go
look around.
I'll be right back.

Well, I am.

It's pretty crazy.

Al's gonna find us a way out, okay?

39:01.272 --> 39:04.036
Okay, I got it.
You go back the way you came.

39:04.108 --> 39:06.269
Past that hangar there
you're gonna come to a field.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.278
You cross it,
and there's a lake.
No, no, no, no. She can't swim, Al.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.280
We can't cross the lake.
It doesn't matter.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.578
There's a big pipe going across it
You can get across on that.

39:12.650 --> 39:16.211
Then you come to a fence.
You climb the fence,
and then you're home free.

39:16.287 --> 39:18.721
All right.
Let's go. Give me your hand.

and saved me.

Put that gun down.

He stops his tests with chimps.
Oh, that's good.

develops this helmet
