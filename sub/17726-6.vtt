You are not working
for me any longer,

00:06.440 --> 00:07.675
and you're not
coming in to Sur,

00:07.708 --> 00:10.411
and you're not
coming in to Pump.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.080
- It's not like we agree
on everything.

00:12.113 --> 00:15.349
Kids, marriage.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.851
- I've had all the girls ask me
if you're seeing a married man.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.853
- The man I am seeing,
who I'm very much in love with,

00:19.887 --> 00:21.155
is not married.

00:21.189 --> 00:24.024
- I found out yesterday
that the way the wife found out

00:24.058 --> 00:26.560
is she went through his phone
and saw sex tape videos of them.

00:26.594 --> 00:27.561
- [gasps]

00:27.595 --> 00:29.029
- both: No!

that it's our time *

00:36.370 --> 00:38.472
* These are the best days

00:38.506 --> 00:41.342
* Of our lives

00:41.375 --> 00:45.079
* Just raise
your glasses high *

more, more, more *

* More, more, more,
more, more, more *

00:58.159 --> 00:59.127
- Oh, my God.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.262
You were f---ed up last year.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.764
- You can't do this job sober
on Gay Pride.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.133
I dropped a whole thing
of PatrÃ³n

01:05.133 --> 01:07.335
in the ice thing,
and it broke.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.637
[glass shattering]

01:09.670 --> 01:11.004
- You tried to convince me
and Scheana...

01:11.038 --> 01:12.473
- Yep. Oh, my God.
- That you're sober, like--

01:12.506 --> 01:14.308
"I don't know." And we're like--
- "I am fine."

01:14.342 --> 01:15.809
- You're like--
- All right.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.045
Stop misbehaving.
Whatever you're doing, stop it.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.613
- Hey.
- Hi, strangers.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.749
- Hello, hello.
- Hi.

01:21.782 --> 01:24.185
- So everybody enthusiastic?

01:24.218 --> 01:25.519
- Yes.
- Ready for Pride?

01:25.553 --> 01:26.854
- Whoo!
- Let's do it.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.589
- It's an important day
for West Hollywood,

01:28.622 --> 01:31.459
because it's about supporting
the LGBT community.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.793
I'm gonna be here, there,
and everywhere.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.163
I'm gonna be
running between Pump,

01:35.163 --> 01:37.231
and I'm also on the bus

01:37.265 --> 01:38.999
with the British Consulate
this year, so...

01:39.032 --> 01:41.235
- Whoa.
- Even though you're working,

01:41.269 --> 01:45.273
it's still very much
a party type of atmosphere.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.341
Pride is coming up,
and every year

01:47.375 --> 01:49.243
we really celebrate this day.

01:49.277 --> 01:52.513
It's one of the biggest days
of the year for Sur and Pump.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.182
We want you to get
the job done properly,

01:54.182 --> 01:56.250
but it's a fun time, okay?

01:56.284 --> 01:59.052
If you see me
on the British bus, then cheer,

01:59.086 --> 02:00.521
and wave, and, you know, like--

02:00.554 --> 02:02.990
- Just to be clear, James is not
allowed here, correct?

02:03.023 --> 02:06.594
- James is not allowed here,
but that's my--my choice.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.596
- So we'll actually
have good music for once.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.732
- Oh, what
a little bitchy comment.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.867
- The anticipation's killing me.
What are we wearing?

02:13.901 --> 02:17.205
- Nice gay pink Pride hats.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.839
- Perfect.
- Oh, yeah. That's fine.

02:18.872 --> 02:19.940
Hey, I'm down with this.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.442
- Yeah, right?
- This is good.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.578
Every year, Lisa comes up
with some zany-ass costume.

02:24.612 --> 02:28.048
This year, as long as it's not
angel wings, I'm okay with it.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.483
- Cheers, guys.

02:29.517 --> 02:32.820
To wearing wings
and getting butterfly tattoos.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.222
- How embarrassing.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.623
- Well, it doesn't look like
very much is in the bag.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.225
What the hell is that?
- Whoa. Whoa.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.892
- Ariana, you're gonna
wear this.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.328
- Oh, what?
- Whoo!

02:40.361 --> 02:42.796
- I have to, like,
fully get naked to put this on.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.598
- Yeah. That's why we like it.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.066
- That looks like
a onesie for a baby.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.301
- Lala can wear that one.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.937
- These Gay Pride outfits
get smaller

02:49.970 --> 02:52.240
and smaller every year,

02:52.273 --> 02:54.308
and at this rate, next year
they're gonna be asking us

02:54.342 --> 02:56.344
to serve cosmos
butt-ass naked.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.745
- Ariana, let's have a look.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.513
- Oh, wow.

02:59.547 --> 03:02.049
That's amazing.
- Yeah.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.084
- Damn.
Dude, that's hot.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.320
- If I could go back in time,

03:06.354 --> 03:07.788
I would rather hook up
with Ariana than Kristen.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.390
That's for sure.
It's like night and day.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.259
Apples and oranges.
I'm kidding.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.426
No, I would never
do that to Tom.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.861
Again.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.396
[laughing]

03:15.429 --> 03:16.830
- Yay.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.532
- A black bra would
be really cute.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.767
- Yeah.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.834
- She does have a great ass.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.170
Like, amazingly good ass.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.272
She does.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.906
- Does anybody want
to try this on?

03:25.939 --> 03:27.174
Come on.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.776
- I don't have underwear on.

03:28.809 --> 03:29.843
- Oh, my God.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.011
- You don't have underwear on?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.580
Why would you go out
without underwear?

03:32.613 --> 03:34.282
- 'Cause I feel confined.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.650
- You've got a short dress
on and no underwear?

03:36.684 --> 03:39.119
- You're welcome.
I'm just kidding.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.954
- Who announces
in front of everyone

03:40.988 --> 03:43.156
that you're not
wearing underwear?

03:43.190 --> 03:45.626
I hope they burn that chair
that she's sitting in.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.194
- Are we good?
all: Yes.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.329
- Are we good?
- Yes.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.963
- Whoo!
- Thank you, Lisa.

03:49.997 --> 03:55.603
*

03:55.636 --> 03:56.837
- Welcome, you guys.

03:56.870 --> 04:01.309
*

04:01.309 --> 04:03.777
- Ariana--she's doing
a photo shoot tomorrow

04:03.811 --> 04:05.646
for her cocktail book
she's working on.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.648
- It's hard to buy that
she's doing a cocktail book.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.116
I could see you doing one.
- You know--

04:09.149 --> 04:11.218
I think I want to talk to her
about possibly, like--

04:11.319 --> 04:13.621
- Maybe do it together.
- Yeah.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.357
I just don't know if she's
gonna go for that or not.

04:16.390 --> 04:20.193
With Ariana, bartending has
always been just a job to her,

04:20.227 --> 04:22.330
but with me, it's--
it's my passion,

04:22.330 --> 04:23.731
so if you want to make
a cocktail book

04:23.764 --> 04:25.733
with a bartender from Sur,

04:25.766 --> 04:27.868
wouldn't you want
to work with the best?

04:27.901 --> 04:29.236
- What the hell's
a dirty German?

04:29.337 --> 04:30.971
- I have no idea.

04:31.004 --> 04:31.972
- Hi.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.975
Can I get a cup
and some skewers?

04:35.008 --> 04:37.345
I need--these people want,
like, a sh-- ton of olives.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.979
- Right there.
The back corner.

04:39.012 --> 04:42.383
So I talked to Lala
the other day and--

04:42.416 --> 04:43.984
- Oh, this is gonna go well.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.919
- Apparently, me and Ariana

04:45.953 --> 04:49.357
are gonna have lunch
with her boyfriend.

04:49.357 --> 04:50.624
- That's married?
- Well, I just--

04:50.658 --> 04:51.825
- FYI.
- I don't--I mean--

04:51.859 --> 04:54.428
- But did you hear why
the marriage broke up?

04:54.462 --> 04:55.796
- Why did their marriage
break up?

04:55.829 --> 04:57.898
- Because his wife
went through his phone

04:57.931 --> 05:00.934
and found a ton of sex
between him and Lala.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.269
Her friend.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.372
- Okay. Well--

05:04.405 --> 05:05.973
- Where'd the Range Rover
come from?

05:06.006 --> 05:08.642
- Dude, Range Rover
gives away cars every year.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.378
*

05:10.378 --> 05:11.412
- $65,000 vehicle.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.746
- They give away cars
every year.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.147
- Plus rims, plus--
- I don't think she got the car.

05:14.181 --> 05:17.451
I don't think she was
the winner of the car.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.387
- Can I explain how it works?

05:19.420 --> 05:22.956
I've not done any research,
but I can say--

05:22.990 --> 05:24.558
I can...

05:28.596 --> 05:30.831
I mean, the whole point of it
is that...

05:34.402 --> 05:36.704
It could have happened.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.673
- That would be the fourth story
I heard about the Range Rover.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.975
First her mom
leased it for her.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.077
Then her rich boyfriend

05:44.111 --> 05:46.414
paid for the lease in full
for her.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.817
Then she said that she had
a bonus from, like,

05:49.850 --> 05:51.251
five movies she was in.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.421
Tom, like, you guys are, like,
the only people who don't know.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.723
Like, literally everyone
at Sur knows this.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.225
I'm just wondering
what story's gonna be next.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.960
That she actually paid
for it herself?

05:59.993 --> 06:01.429
[laughing]

06:01.462 --> 06:02.896
- I'm sorry.
I don't believe anything

06:02.930 --> 06:05.198
that comes out
of that girl's mouth.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.199
- [sighs]

06:06.233 --> 06:12.039
*

06:12.072 --> 06:13.073
- The two dudes at the bar?

06:13.106 --> 06:14.442
- Yeah.
- Do you remember their--

06:14.442 --> 06:15.943
- Hello.
- Hi.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.845
- I'm gonna have three people.
- Okay.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.713
- I want to be
in Katie's section.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.014
- Okay. Perfect.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.450
- Hopefully that's, like,
a section that's, like,

06:22.483 --> 06:24.452
conducive to,
like, winter bodies.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.021
I can see that everybody here

06:28.055 --> 06:30.824
has not been working
on their summer bodies.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.730
- You said three?
Yeah?

06:36.764 --> 06:39.099
All right. Right this way.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.635
Stassi is all bark and no bite.

06:41.669 --> 06:42.703
Enjoy.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.572
I'm, like,
"Matrix"-ing that bitch.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.040
Whoop.
Whoop.

06:47.074 --> 06:53.280
*

06:53.313 --> 06:54.782
- Hi.
- Hi, guys.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.917
- We're here to meet a friend.
- Okay. What was the name?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.552
both: Stassi.
- Perfect.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.887
I know exactly where you are.
Right this way.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.490
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.157
- So good to see you.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.594
- It's so good to see you guys.

07:06.627 --> 07:07.761
Lauren and Ashley Wirkus

07:07.795 --> 07:09.497
are these towering blonde twins

07:09.497 --> 07:10.798
who I met through
a mutual friend.

07:10.831 --> 07:13.934
You know how you just meet
some people, and you just click?

07:13.967 --> 07:15.335
- Oh, you're so blonde.
I love it.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.104
- Y'all are so blonde.
Your hair.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.106
We had this one
really fun night out,

07:19.139 --> 07:21.509
and now we're just
good friends.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.877
Probably because they like
to drink as much as I do.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.846
Welcome back.
- I know. We're back again.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.881
We haven't been here in so long.
We have, like, a crazy summer,

07:27.915 --> 07:30.050
so we're going to Italy.
We're in a wedding.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.285
- You guys are so bourgie.
It's so annoying.

07:32.319 --> 07:33.420
- Our best friend's
getting married,

07:33.521 --> 07:35.789
and then we start the summer
in the Hamptons.

07:35.823 --> 07:36.824
- Right.
- Have you ever been out

07:36.857 --> 07:37.958
to Montauk?

07:37.991 --> 07:39.159
- Can I just tell you this?

07:39.192 --> 07:41.529
Okay, so--you know,
'cause I lived in New York,

07:41.562 --> 07:43.864
but it was six months
during the winter,

07:43.897 --> 07:45.666
but I have always wanted
to go to the Hamptons,

07:45.699 --> 07:46.967
and I never got to do that.
- Oh.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.168
- It's been, like, something
I've wanted to do

07:48.201 --> 07:49.603
since I was a kid.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.404
- We are, like, making sure that
we are leaving our trip early

07:51.438 --> 07:52.906
so we can be there for...
both: The first weekend.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.575
- Like, I'm not missing
the first weekend.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.776
- When is the first weekend?
Wait--

07:55.809 --> 07:56.844
- It's, like, end of June.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.146
- That's my birthday.
- Shut up.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.548
- June 24th is my birthday.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.849
- Well, if you've never been,
you definitely

08:01.882 --> 08:03.651
should make
a girls' trip to come.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.385
- Do you always do
a big birthday trip?

08:05.418 --> 08:06.887
- I've been known to do that.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.255
- Celebrate your birthday big?

08:08.288 --> 08:09.790
- I have, like, this,
like, weird,

08:09.823 --> 08:11.191
annoying, like, tic.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.561
Why are you here
for my f---ing birthday?

08:13.561 --> 08:15.996
Jax, is this your birthday,
or is it my birthday?

08:16.029 --> 08:17.464
You're coming to
my birthday dinner,

08:17.565 --> 08:19.299
and this is how you treated me.

08:19.332 --> 08:23.270
But the last two years I've just
been really, like, low-key.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.338
So, like, now all of this
excitement that I've, like,

08:25.372 --> 08:27.741
held down is just,
like, coming up.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.910
And I'm about to, like,
throw it up.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.111
- [laughing]

08:31.144 --> 08:33.013
- Ooh.
- Yay.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.347
- I saw that ticket,

08:34.381 --> 08:36.183
and I was like,
"Oh, you're already here."

08:36.216 --> 08:37.985
- I have, like,
a really fun proposal.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.487
- What?

08:40.588 --> 08:41.689
What?

08:41.722 --> 08:44.892
- I want to do
a birthday trip in Montauk.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.193
- In where?

08:46.226 --> 08:51.264
*

08:51.298 --> 08:52.365
- Like, really?

08:52.399 --> 08:54.367
- Montauk is, like,
past the Hamptons.

08:54.401 --> 08:55.969
- Ooh.
- But it is, like,

08:56.003 --> 08:58.005
the best beach town
on the East Coast.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.140
- That would be so much fun.
- Okay. I'm so down.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.975
- I would love that.
- That'd be so fun.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.611
I've never been
to the Hamptons.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.680
My vision of it is, it's always
just been this, like,

09:06.714 --> 09:09.349
rich beach
that all of the New Yorkers

09:09.382 --> 09:11.418
go to in the summer.
You go every weekend.

09:11.451 --> 09:13.621
Your house in the Hamptons,
and you're so cool.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.122
And I just didn't
grow up like that.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.791
- Okay, so you're saying yes?
- I'm saying yes.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.527
- So that means that--
- Cheers to Montauk.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.795
all: To Montauk.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.130
- Whoo!

09:23.163 --> 09:25.098
- I got to get back
before I get in trouble.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.100
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

09:27.134 --> 09:32.840
*

09:32.873 --> 09:34.441
- Hey, Lala.
- Hi, Lisa. How are you?

09:34.474 --> 09:37.177
- Everything okay?
- Everything's great.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.379
- Hey, I'm still
waiting on the sea bass.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.214
Table 15.
- Hello.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.482
What's happening
in the restaurant?

09:42.515 --> 09:44.151
Anything I should know about?
- It's busy.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.386
- Stassi's here
with some friends, apparently,

09:46.419 --> 09:47.387
from New York.
- Stassi's here?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.656
- Yeah.
They're right over there.

09:48.656 --> 09:49.757
- Why don't you go over there
and say hi?

09:49.790 --> 09:50.858
I'm sure she would love that.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.159
- You know what?
I probably will.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.861
Anyway, I'll see you
in a minute.

09:53.894 --> 09:54.995
- You're like--
you go to the bar, like,

09:55.028 --> 09:56.063
"Can I order a vodka?"

09:56.096 --> 09:57.898
- Just down in one.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.366
- "Can I order a vodka?"

09:59.399 --> 10:00.834
- Hi.
- Well, hello.

10:00.868 --> 10:01.969
- Hello.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.004
- These are my friends
Lauren and Ashley.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.372
- Welcome.
How is everything?

10:05.405 --> 10:06.573
- Wonderful.
- All right.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.808
Well, good.
- We're enjoying ourselves.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.109
- Enjoy. Enjoy your meal.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.944
- Thank you.
- I hope everything is good.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.317
- My friends are here tonight.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.821
- I'll get you another one?

10:20.854 --> 10:22.522
- Should I do a straight shot
at this point?

10:22.555 --> 10:24.624
[laughter]

10:24.658 --> 10:25.693
- Coming up...
- You're not gonna

10:25.726 --> 10:27.227
take attention away from me.

10:34.802 --> 10:35.168
[upbeat music]

10:35.969 --> 10:36.937
- * N-n-night

10:36.970 --> 10:39.006
* N-n-night

10:39.039 --> 10:40.373
*

10:40.407 --> 10:41.374
* Oh

10:41.408 --> 10:42.776
*

10:42.810 --> 10:44.211
* N-n-night,
n-n-night *

10:44.244 --> 10:46.579
- I'll just set everything up
right here.

10:46.613 --> 10:47.580
- Yo.
- What's up, guys?

10:47.614 --> 10:48.581
- Hey, what's up, guys?
- Hey.

10:48.615 --> 10:49.717
- I found Edmund.
- How you doing?

10:49.750 --> 10:50.818
- Good, how you doing?
- Good to see you.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.052
- You too.
- Hey, how's it going?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.053
- Ariana, good to see you.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.387
Is there, like,
any kind of, like,

10:54.421 --> 10:55.956
rundown you guys want
to give us, as far as, like--

10:55.989 --> 11:00.060
- So I have a book proposal that
we're shopping to publishers.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.729
I've been working
on this cocktail book

11:01.762 --> 11:04.097
with my partner Allie
for the last few months.

11:04.131 --> 11:07.935
I have to do some promotional
cocktail videos, some tutorials,

11:07.968 --> 11:11.404
and get people excited about it
on the Internet.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.306
I wanted to ask you.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.810
On Thursday, I'm working
on a cocktail book.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.546
I would just have
my brother come in here

11:19.579 --> 11:21.014
and take, like, glamour shots.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.783
- Are you talking about
when you're working?

11:22.816 --> 11:24.451
- No, no, no, no.
Before it opens.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.819
Like, this time.
- Okay.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.288
But also if you're doing it
for you, do it for me too.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.223
Post it on social media.
Tag Sur.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.624
- Yeah.
- Tag Villa Blanca.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.260
Tag Pump.
That way it's win-win.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.294
- I know.
Yeah.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.462
It's really encouraging,

11:35.495 --> 11:38.766
because I might be able
to get this book made.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.568
Like, I don't know if you can
tell that I'm beaming,

11:41.601 --> 11:43.336
but I'm beaming.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.772
It's not just bronzer.

11:44.772 --> 11:47.808
- All right, so with these
videos, what are you thinking?

11:47.841 --> 11:50.377
- I don't even want it to be--
- It can just be a shot of you,

11:50.410 --> 11:52.412
you know, muddling this
real quickly,

11:52.445 --> 11:55.382
pouring this, shaking this,
straining into that.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.784
Then you at the end being like,

11:56.817 --> 11:58.986
"And that's how you make
the pump and glory."

11:59.019 --> 12:01.221
- It's like,
I don't want to talk.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.057
I'm not a salesperson.
- I am.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.927
Maybe if it's, like,
a woman publisher,

12:06.960 --> 12:10.430
I can just have a meeting
with her and be like this.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.801
- [scoffs]

12:17.537 --> 12:19.039
- I am horrified.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.441
Can you please
put your f---ing pants on?

12:21.474 --> 12:22.943
- I'm wondering if Ariana knows

12:22.976 --> 12:25.145
exactly what it's gonna take
to put this book out.

12:25.178 --> 12:29.950
My biggest feat here
is to try and motivate her,

12:29.983 --> 12:32.019
but not be annoying.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.321
We got a lot to do,
so let's do it.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.688
- I hate your attitude
right now.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.224
- [laughing]

12:37.257 --> 12:39.392
- I think I'm failing.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.328
I was gonna polish that glass
for you.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.395
- I'm already gonna do that.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.730
- Oh, okay.
Sorry.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.198
- Why would you think
that I wasn't doing that?

12:45.232 --> 12:46.699
- I don't know.
I was gonna try to help.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.035
- 'Cause you are not helping.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.170
You're making it sound
like I'm incompetent.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.839
- No, I'm not.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.541
- This drink actually doesn't
even have a name, so--

12:54.574 --> 12:56.877
- You should call it
the LVP twist.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.545
- It's supposed to be
pink lemonade.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.147
- The basil twist.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.414
The basil twist.
That's nice.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.649
- Why?
What is the twist thing?

13:02.682 --> 13:05.052
- All right, we can come up
with a name later.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.186
- We are ready to roll.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.355
- Okay.
- And action.

13:08.388 --> 13:12.893
*

13:12.926 --> 13:15.896
- [slurping]

13:15.929 --> 13:22.936
*

13:26.206 --> 13:28.775
I think we should be having
more fun while doing this.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.880
- Tom really loves to be
the center of attention.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.916
He's jealous
that he wasn't approached

13:35.949 --> 13:37.550
to work on this project.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.020
I know that deep down
he believes

13:40.053 --> 13:42.322
that his way of doing it
would be better.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.790
I don't like what
you're doing there.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.525
Like, for one day,

13:45.558 --> 13:47.527
when it's something
that I've been working on,

13:47.560 --> 13:50.964
can I just maybe
have it be about me?

13:50.998 --> 13:52.199
For once?

13:52.232 --> 13:53.533
- Oh, my God.
I want to try this one.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.734
- Yeah. It's not that good.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.503
You know, I would have
probably done better.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.405
- Wow.

13:58.438 --> 14:03.376
*

14:03.410 --> 14:07.614
- Have you talked to Stassi
about Montauk?

14:07.647 --> 14:08.815
- No. Not really.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.083
- Oh. She wants to just
do girls.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.152
- Yeah.
- So obviously,

14:12.185 --> 14:13.320
we all want you there.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.822
- Well, yeah.
I mean, I would love to do that,

14:15.923 --> 14:19.826
but Ariana just yesterday said

14:19.927 --> 14:21.294
that she was doing something

14:21.328 --> 14:22.996
for her birthday
that weekend too,

14:23.030 --> 14:25.298
and she told Jax and I to go.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.634
- Guys, by the way,
we're planning something

14:27.667 --> 14:29.269
for Ariana's birthday.
- Oh, really?

14:29.302 --> 14:30.637
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.940
- We're thinking maybe
some kind of, like, trip.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.007
- Yeah.
- I'm down for trips.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.775
- Yeah. Me too.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.945
- I had no idea she was
doing anything for her birthday.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.279
Like, we were texting
last night,

14:39.312 --> 14:40.447
and she didn't say anything.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.614
- I don't know, guys.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.984
I'm like--I'm lost right now.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.318
- This is literally
the first time

14:45.352 --> 14:47.787
I've heard about a trip
for Ariana's birthday.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.157
I don't see Ariana
not inviting me at all,

14:50.190 --> 14:51.524
but if she doesn't,

14:51.558 --> 14:53.126
obviously my feelings
are gonna be hurt,

14:53.160 --> 14:55.195
so I'm just waiting
for that invite.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.429
Even though I can't go.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.666
- Hi. Did I hear
you guys mention the Hamptons?

14:59.699 --> 15:03.370
- Yeah, we're going to Montauk
for Stassi's birthday,

15:03.403 --> 15:06.273
so Kristen, Katie, and I.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.707
And then we just asked Brittany,

15:07.740 --> 15:10.743
but I guess Ariana's
doing a birthday trip too

15:10.777 --> 15:12.012
which is news to me?

15:12.045 --> 15:13.580
- Well, I mean,
if you guys flew private,

15:13.613 --> 15:15.748
you could always
fly out later after.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.985
- So are you offering a jet?
- Sure.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.586
I mean, I could get you one
if you needed.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.456
- Oh, yeah.
- I'll get a big one.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.692
- I have never--but that's okay.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.361
- You've never what?
- Been on one.

15:28.395 --> 15:31.864
- I don't really like
sharing planes with, like,

15:31.898 --> 15:34.301
commercial--
it freaks me out, you know?

15:34.334 --> 15:36.369
- I'll fly with the rest
of the world.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.804
- Yeah.
- So it's cool.

15:37.837 --> 15:40.207
- Have fun folding napkins.
- Thank you.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.474
Have fun answering phones.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.609
- Thank you.

15:42.642 --> 15:46.513
- To me, that sounds a lot
like a whore,

15:46.546 --> 15:48.615
and she's not been shy about it.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.018
This shows just how moronic
this girl is.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.885
- I think that's enough.
- Yeah.

[pulsing electronic music]

15:55.922 --> 16:00.660
*

16:00.693 --> 16:02.262
- Ooh, "hot Asian."

16:02.295 --> 16:03.730
- Yeah. I just saw that.
- Yeah.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.165
Are you gonna do the hot Asian?

16:05.198 --> 16:07.400
- I'm definitely gonna do
the hot Asian.

16:07.434 --> 16:08.401
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

16:08.435 --> 16:09.736
- Hi.
- What's up?

16:09.769 --> 16:11.138
- Are you guys sick of
waiting on me?

16:11.171 --> 16:13.306
- Eh.
- I'm hungry.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.907
- How's it going?
- Good. How are you guys?

16:14.941 --> 16:16.209
- Good.
Oh, here we go.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.677
- Did you guys want
to get started with something?

16:17.710 --> 16:20.613
- We're gonna do the hot Asian.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.749
- Can I do a
"love me long time," please?

16:22.782 --> 16:23.816
- Yes. All right.
- Thank you so much.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.552
- You got it.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.120
- What are you wearing tomorrow
for Gay Pride?

16:27.154 --> 16:29.389
- I have a clown hat.
- What?

16:29.422 --> 16:32.059
- A little one. I think
it's actually really cute.

16:32.059 --> 16:35.462
I really want to wear my pasties

16:35.495 --> 16:37.197
that have tassels on them.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.066
I know all the other girls
are gonna be

16:39.066 --> 16:42.269
completely offended
if my nipples are out,

16:42.302 --> 16:44.304
except Ariana.
Ariana knows.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.139
My man likes me whether
your tits are out or not,

16:46.173 --> 16:47.440
Lala, so you just do you.

16:47.474 --> 16:52.445
- So Ariana's birthday
is coming up.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.647
- Am I sensing an invite?
I'm invited this year?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.583
- I think so.
- Oh, my God.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.152
- Maybe if you pick up
this lunch, we'll consider it.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.287
No, I'm kidding.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.588
- Have you ever been
to a NASCAR race before?

17:01.621 --> 17:02.989
- No.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.657
- Do you want to go?
- But I want to go.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.426
Is that what you're thinking?
- Tom and I have been to a--

17:06.459 --> 17:08.095
we've been to a couple
NASCAR races,

17:08.128 --> 17:11.298
and there's one in Sonoma
the weekend, like,

17:11.331 --> 17:12.399
right after my birthday.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.167
- We have to do it.
- Yeah.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.336
- Yeah.
- Boom.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.004
Best birthday idea ever.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.272
both: Yay.

17:19.306 --> 17:22.442
- I was talking to Scheana
and Jax the other day.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.244
Scheana's like,
"Oh," about, like,

17:24.277 --> 17:26.346
this guy on Instagram
and all this stuff.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.116
- Oh, now I have
an Instagram boyfriend. Okay.

17:29.116 --> 17:30.550
- No. Apparently, like,
you took--

17:30.583 --> 17:32.685
- I can't keep up.
- Is there any truth to that?

17:32.719 --> 17:33.820
- No. In fact--

17:33.853 --> 17:35.688
- Do you know who
this guy might be?

17:35.722 --> 17:37.890
- No, and I've asked them.
I said, "What--give me a name."

17:37.924 --> 17:39.359
I don't understand

17:39.392 --> 17:41.761
where the rumor's coming from,
who it's coming from.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.363
They won't give me the name
of the guy.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.797
They won't show me pictures,

17:44.831 --> 17:46.199
and they won't tell me
the person

17:46.233 --> 17:47.900
who's feeding them
this information.

17:47.934 --> 17:52.539
Scheana is claiming
that I broke up a marriage

17:52.572 --> 17:54.941
and that I sleep
with married men,

17:54.974 --> 17:56.809
and you know what?
She's completely right.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.378
Tell your dad thanks, Scheana.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.547
Tell your mom I'm sorry.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.749
- By the way, what's his name?
Who is this guy?

18:02.782 --> 18:04.617
- I didn't say his name yet.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.619
- Why? Just tell me.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.788
- I was going to try and plan--

18:08.821 --> 18:11.558
if you guys are willing
to fly to Florida

18:11.591 --> 18:13.893
and do a game?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.762
- Yeah. What kind of game?
- Okay.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.531
- A football game.
- A football game!

18:18.565 --> 18:20.567
- I mean, why can't you just
tell me his name?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.169
Is it really that big of a deal?

18:22.169 --> 18:24.003
What does she think
I'm gonna do, like, scream

18:24.036 --> 18:26.639
and, like, clap my hands
or, like, go crazy?

18:26.673 --> 18:28.775
Like, I don't even
watch football.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.043
We did a cocktail shoot
for Ariana's cocktail book.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.179
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.847
- I just want it to be,
like, short and quick.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.550
I don't really want it to be
so much about personality.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.419
I want it to be about, like--
- The drink.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.354
- The drink looks really good.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.223
I know what you would do
if it was you.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.557
You would do your own
your own way.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.426
I feel like me being involved
is what's gonna--

18:46.459 --> 18:48.195
- I actually told her
I want to be involved with it.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.597
- I feel like--
Tom, can I finish?

18:52.565 --> 18:54.100
You're not gonna be the face,

18:54.201 --> 18:57.470
and you're not gonna
take attention away from me.

18:57.504 --> 19:00.407
Don't f---ing roll your eyes,
you little f---ing bitch.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.245
I just saw you roll your eyes
over there.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.247
You can't even be
a part of this conversation

19:07.280 --> 19:08.481
like a normal person?

19:08.515 --> 19:10.217
- Ariana, do you understand
that literally

19:10.217 --> 19:13.220
Jax, Katie, Scheana, everybody

19:13.220 --> 19:14.387
came up to me,
and they're like,

19:14.421 --> 19:16.723
"Why is Ariana doing
a cocktail book and not you?"

19:16.756 --> 19:18.124
- Really?
- Yes.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.460
- I've been bartending ten years
at some of the busiest

19:20.493 --> 19:22.662
and most well-known places
in the country.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.131
- With a reputation
as Grumpy Cat.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.299
- Somebody's a bitter Betty.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.667
- Okay. Hold on.
Can I just--

19:27.700 --> 19:30.237
- Somebody's been
a bitter Betty for years,

19:30.270 --> 19:32.104
and now they're
letting it all out.

19:32.138 --> 19:34.106
- He obviously wants
to be involved.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.542
- Right, and I tried
to make this

19:35.575 --> 19:36.676
a heart-to-heart
the other night,

19:36.709 --> 19:38.010
and he doesn't know
how to do that.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.379
- Yes I do.
- All he knows how to do

19:39.412 --> 19:42.081
is f---ing get all wound up
and f---ing pissy with me.

19:42.114 --> 19:43.383
- Let's be f---ing real.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.685
I'm way more positive
than you are in general.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.153
- And you don't see
that as being--

19:47.254 --> 19:48.321
- I've been an outsider here

19:48.355 --> 19:50.022
in a public setting,
and I'm watching.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.858
And you're both going at
each other's throats.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.026
- I mean, I could just
be like this the whole time

19:54.060 --> 19:55.628
and passive-aggressively smile,

19:55.662 --> 19:57.264
but what--
- That's a genuine smile.

19:57.264 --> 19:59.666
I'm just laughing
at how you can't lighten up.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.901
[dramatic music]

20:01.934 --> 20:02.902
- Coming up...

20:02.935 --> 20:04.737
Part of me wanted to cancel.

20:10.377 --> 20:10.810
[police siren wails]

[solemn music]

20:15.582 --> 20:23.022
*

20:23.055 --> 20:24.156
- Okay, Lisa,
you look wonderful.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.625
- Thank you.
- You all set for a big day?

20:25.658 --> 20:29.796
- Yeah, but there's just
such a somber shadow on today,

20:29.829 --> 20:31.498
in light of what's happened.

20:31.531 --> 20:35.001
What happened in Orlando

20:35.034 --> 20:38.738
was a heinous act of terrorism

20:38.771 --> 20:42.309
against the LGBTQ community.

20:42.342 --> 20:45.378
- Terror. This time inside
an Orlando nightclub.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.913
50 people are dead.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.682
A shooting massacre
inside the Pulse nightclub

20:49.716 --> 20:52.218
popular in Orlando's
gay community

20:52.251 --> 20:54.621
ranks as the single deadliest
shooting attack

20:54.654 --> 20:56.022
in American history.

20:56.055 --> 20:59.792
- Many, many people
died this morning.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.027
What are we supposed to do?

21:01.060 --> 21:03.730
Do we abandon the parade?

21:03.763 --> 21:06.999
Do we show a moment of darkness

21:07.033 --> 21:09.936
and not celebration
in light of what's happened?

21:09.969 --> 21:12.104
- Beyond tragic, and I mean,
this is supposed to be such,

21:12.138 --> 21:14.106
like, a beautiful time

21:14.140 --> 21:16.108
when people come together
and people--you know--

21:16.142 --> 21:17.910
- It's very sad.
- No one wants to live in fear.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.681
Are you okay?
- No. Not really.

21:21.714 --> 21:22.982
- Okay.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.518
- Why would we be?
What do we do?

21:25.552 --> 21:30.189
Do we stand up with
everybody else and keep going,

21:30.222 --> 21:32.625
or do we fear for our safety,

21:32.659 --> 21:35.562
and close down, and capitulate,

21:35.595 --> 21:36.996
and close the doors?

21:37.029 --> 21:38.598
I don't know, and I think

21:38.631 --> 21:41.233
that's a personal decision
to each and every one.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.269
You know, look at
all these people here

21:43.370 --> 21:46.439
that have endured
a lifetime of struggles.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.440
What do we do?

21:47.474 --> 21:50.377
Do we go home
and let one asshole win?

21:50.410 --> 21:53.646
- My heart is really heavy
today, for a lot of reasons.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.682
It's been just mere hours

21:55.715 --> 21:57.149
about finding out
what had happened,

21:57.183 --> 21:59.719
and it just makes me
feel so anxious,

21:59.752 --> 22:01.554
and sad, and fearful.

22:01.588 --> 22:02.555
- It's up to you.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.591
You don't have
to be here for me.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.158
Not at all, but it's up to you.

22:06.192 --> 22:08.094
Either stay or you go.

22:08.127 --> 22:10.963
I don't think any less of you
if you want to go.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.399
- I am not the type of person

22:12.399 --> 22:14.033
that would just skip out
on a shift.

22:14.066 --> 22:17.269
I truly just feel
that it's a better idea

22:17.303 --> 22:18.805
to not go in.

22:18.838 --> 22:25.845

[police siren blares]

22:28.715 --> 22:35.722
*

22:37.424 --> 22:39.025
- Look, Jax even told me.
He said,

22:39.058 --> 22:40.893
"Peter, wear a vest,
and good luck."

22:40.927 --> 22:42.429
- Oh, my gosh.
He's not coming?

22:42.462 --> 22:44.130
- No. I don't think so.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.966
Jax isn't coming.
No one's coming.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.635
- I mean, it's scary.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.302
- I'm freaked out too.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.208
- Nathalie, I'm a little
freaked out.

22:56.242 --> 22:57.844
- Yeah?
- Like, I will admit.

22:59.211 --> 23:03.616
*

23:03.650 --> 23:06.519
- Is it too early to start
for a glass of wine?

23:08.254 --> 23:10.022
Thank you.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.290
My mom called me
and was like,

23:11.323 --> 23:14.160
"I do not want you going
anywhere near Gay Pride today."

23:14.193 --> 23:16.729
- So you're not gonna go though?
- No.

23:16.763 --> 23:20.633
I'm sorry, but me walking people
to their tables

23:20.667 --> 23:23.970
and explaining the specials
for $10 an hour

23:24.003 --> 23:26.172
is not worth
me risking my life over.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.040
It's a pet peeve of mine
when people say,

23:28.074 --> 23:31.578
"We still need to, you know,
carry on and not let them win."

23:31.611 --> 23:32.645
It's like, they've won.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.346
People have
lost their lives, okay?

23:34.380 --> 23:36.616
So I don't care
what anybody else does.

23:36.649 --> 23:40.252
Me personally, I don't feel
comfortable walking around

23:40.286 --> 23:43.289
and pretending like
something crazy didn't happen.

23:43.322 --> 23:45.324
I mean, there's no way
that you could have

23:45.357 --> 23:47.760
thrown me in a clown hat
and pasties,

23:47.794 --> 23:48.995
and that's it?

23:49.028 --> 23:50.730
- That's all they were
gonna have you in?

23:50.763 --> 23:53.099
- Yeah.
Oh, and a high-waisted thong.

23:53.132 --> 23:56.135
[helicopter whirring]

See, that sh-- freaks me out.
- Helicopters.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.887

- Yeah?

- Hey.
- Hi.

24:16.022 --> 24:19.926
- I went to see Lisa
at the parade, you know,

24:19.959 --> 24:22.529
and you've read the news, right?
- Yeah.

24:22.529 --> 24:24.163
- You know what happened
in Orlando?

24:24.196 --> 24:25.598
- It's so senseless.

24:25.632 --> 24:26.899
[knocking at door]
- I know, Bub.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.000
- Come in.

24:28.034 --> 24:30.336
- What's up, guys?
- Oh, my God.

24:30.369 --> 24:32.171
I saw Lisa at the parade today,
and I went there,

24:32.204 --> 24:33.540
and it was just, like,
so chaotic.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.542
And I was just, like--
kept, like, looking around.

24:35.542 --> 24:36.943
I did not feel, like, safe.

24:36.976 --> 24:40.212
There's trucks going by
with police

24:40.246 --> 24:42.414
or military with helmets,

24:42.448 --> 24:44.617
and vests, and guns.
And I'm just like, "Wow."

24:44.651 --> 24:46.385
Like, if that's what
has to happen to be safe,

24:46.418 --> 24:47.687
then I don't need to be here.

24:47.720 --> 24:48.988
- They just found another guy.

24:49.021 --> 24:49.989
- Another guy?
- Yeah.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.624
- That's what I heard.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.059
Yeah.
- I know.

24:53.092 --> 24:56.395
I was, like,
looking forward to...

24:56.428 --> 24:58.297
you know, drinking today
and, like...

24:58.330 --> 24:59.599
- Celebrating.
- Celebrating.

24:59.632 --> 25:00.600
And I'm just like,

25:00.633 --> 25:02.101
"Dude, are you
f---ing kidding me?"

25:02.134 --> 25:04.571
It's like, dude, we're all
just people, you know?

25:04.571 --> 25:07.173
Like, it's f---ing crazy, man.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.275
- Waking up today,
and reading about what happened,

25:09.308 --> 25:11.778
and just, you know--hi.

25:11.811 --> 25:12.779
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.013
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.915
Tom, do you want
a drink or something?

25:15.948 --> 25:17.617
- I don't know, man.

25:17.650 --> 25:20.219
I mean, is somebody
planning something here?

25:20.252 --> 25:22.722
- That's what--

25:22.755 --> 25:25.391
I mean, the guy who got arrested
in Santa Monica.

25:25.424 --> 25:26.993
Like, I mean it's not about,

25:27.026 --> 25:28.795
like, living in fear.
I know this can happen--

25:28.828 --> 25:30.496
- Vodka soda?
Do you want a vodka soda?

25:30.597 --> 25:31.998
- No, thank you.

25:32.031 --> 25:35.334
- This could happen anywhere,
you know?

25:35.367 --> 25:37.403
And we shouldn't just, like,
be afraid to go outside.

25:37.436 --> 25:39.005
But, like, I am.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.507
- I feel like I want everybody
to be together right now.

25:41.608 --> 25:44.243
Like, that's something that--
like, I don't want to be alone.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.012
But, like, it's so scary.
- Yeah.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.680
- Like, it's so scary.

25:47.714 --> 25:51.217
This shooting has put just this
whole day into perspective.

25:51.250 --> 25:54.120
We all need to be together,

25:54.153 --> 25:56.856
stay together,
and just be safe.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.157
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.792
Just, dude, it's like--
it kills me, man.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.327
- I know.
I know.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.796
- It's like, every person that
I see walking around out there,

26:03.830 --> 26:05.431
like, I'm just like--

26:05.464 --> 26:06.799
I feel bad.
- I know.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.201
As if they haven't been
oppressed enough for the past,

26:09.235 --> 26:11.137
like, since all of existence.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.138
F---, man.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.640
- [crying]

26:13.640 --> 26:16.508
They're talking about how,
like, you know,

26:16.542 --> 26:17.944
people are still--

26:17.977 --> 26:20.112
they're getting rid
of the dead bodies,

26:20.146 --> 26:22.381
and their cell phones
are ringing.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.651
People are looking
for 'em and stuff.

26:24.651 --> 26:26.886
It's just so sad.

26:31.858 --> 26:33.960
I just--
I'm, like, beside myself.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.494
This doesn't even seem real,

26:35.527 --> 26:36.929
and I'm sitting here wondering,

26:36.963 --> 26:40.667
like, if I should go into Sur
when people have died.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.235
Like, what a sh---y day.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.503
Yeah I just--I don't know.

26:44.536 --> 26:46.038
I'm, like,
gonna have a hard time

26:46.072 --> 26:48.574
just keeping it together today,
you know?

26:52.544 --> 26:58.250
*

26:58.284 --> 27:00.687
- I think I might have a drink.
- Do you know what?

27:00.687 --> 27:01.888
This is the right time.

27:01.921 --> 27:04.490
*

27:04.523 --> 27:05.557
- Hey, Lala.
It's Peter.

27:05.591 --> 27:06.693
I was just calling to see

27:06.726 --> 27:08.360
if you were gonna
come into work today.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.063
We need you, you know,
at the host stand.

27:11.097 --> 27:15.501
This day is the biggest day
at Sur of the year.

27:15.534 --> 27:16.969
Hey, Tom.
It's Peter.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.237
Yeah, I was just calling to see

27:18.270 --> 27:20.707
if you were gonna come in
and bartend for us.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.208
And it's a double-edged sword.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.610
It's like, I don't want my
employees to feel uncomfortable,

27:24.711 --> 27:26.913
but at the same time,
I need people to work.

27:26.946 --> 27:30.717
- At the tone,
please record your message.

27:30.717 --> 27:33.720
You may hang up or press 1
for more options.

27:36.255 --> 27:39.225
[crowd cheering]

27:39.258 --> 27:45.464
*

27:45.497 --> 27:47.399
- I don't know.
What do you think?

27:47.433 --> 27:48.835
What's the latest report?

27:48.868 --> 27:50.269
Where's the security?

27:50.302 --> 27:52.271
- They have one person
riding on the bus,

27:52.304 --> 27:55.742
but again, Lisa,
there's nothing you can do.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.977
And it can happen anywhere.
- Well, I know.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.779
It makes me worry,
but what do we do?

27:59.812 --> 28:02.414
We capitulate, we give in,
we back down?

28:02.448 --> 28:03.582
What do we do?

28:06.285 --> 28:07.286
We don't.

28:08.554 --> 28:11.023
F--- it.
I'm going on the bus.

28:11.057 --> 28:14.360
*

28:14.393 --> 28:15.895
I'm getting on that bus,

28:15.928 --> 28:18.430
and I'm gonna stand
in utter defiance

28:18.464 --> 28:19.631
of what's happened.

28:19.665 --> 28:22.068
Let's get this show on the road!

28:22.101 --> 28:25.437
Because that's what today
is all about,

28:25.471 --> 28:28.574
is for standing up
for what we believe in.

28:28.607 --> 28:33.179
*

28:33.212 --> 28:34.180
Coming up...

28:34.213 --> 28:36.615
We unite.
We stand defiantly

28:36.648 --> 28:39.618
in the face
of a heinous act like that.

28:39.651 --> 28:40.787
Now turn the music on,

28:46.826 --> 28:47.193
[upbeat music]

28:49.796 --> 28:51.463
*

28:51.497 --> 28:54.033
- Let's get this show
on the road!

28:54.066 --> 29:01.573
*

29:01.607 --> 29:03.275
Happy Pride!

29:03.309 --> 29:05.945
*

29:07.914 --> 29:08.915
- Yeah.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.351
I'm actually overwhelmed
by the fact

29:12.384 --> 29:13.820
that so many people
have shown up.

29:16.823 --> 29:19.959
Stand strong.
Stand strong.

29:19.992 --> 29:23.395
*

29:23.429 --> 29:25.331
- Did Lisa go on the float?
- Yeah.

29:25.364 --> 29:29.268
I texted Lisa,
and she got on the bus.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.403
- She went on it?
That's so crazy.

29:31.437 --> 29:34.073
Differences aside,
there wouldn't be a parade

29:34.106 --> 29:35.842
if there wasn't Lisa on a bus.

29:35.875 --> 29:38.911
And I have to say, like,
I'm impressed.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.880
That took a lot of guts.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.849
- Well, if we go,
we should all go as a unit.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.250
- I don't--I don't--

29:44.283 --> 29:46.118
I don't want to go,

29:46.152 --> 29:47.854
and I have, like,
so much anxiety.

29:47.887 --> 29:48.888
- I don't understand it.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.322
Gay Pride--
it's not just Gay Pride.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.324
It's like a, you know,
celebration of life,

29:52.358 --> 29:54.660
and love, and human rights.
I love our community.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.228
I'm so proud to live
in West Hollywood,

29:56.262 --> 29:58.297
and I really do have
a sense of pride living here.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.866
- I think I'm gonna go.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.467
- Where is Ariana?
- She's at home.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.370
She's getting ready, 'cause
she was gonna get ready at Sur,

30:04.403 --> 30:05.404
and then--
- Is she going?

30:05.437 --> 30:08.174
- Yeah. We're gonna go.

30:08.207 --> 30:11.911
- I just, like--
I have a hard time, like,

30:11.944 --> 30:15.514
focusing and doing my job
when I'm just, like, getting--

30:15.547 --> 30:18.250
like, been so upset,
in tears, like, all morning.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.518
- I mean, with everything
that happened,

30:19.551 --> 30:21.520
I completely understand

30:21.553 --> 30:25.057
why somebody wouldn't want
to go into West Hollywood

30:25.091 --> 30:27.493
or go into work,
but Lisa got up today.

30:27.526 --> 30:30.462
She's on the float,
and I just don't feel like

30:30.496 --> 30:32.831
it's really fair
for me to sit here.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.100
I need to be there.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.367
You guys are staying?

30:35.401 --> 30:36.835
- I don't even know.
- I'll let you know

30:36.869 --> 30:38.270
what the situation
is at Sur, like--

30:38.304 --> 30:39.872
- Yeah, will you update me
in a little bit?

30:39.906 --> 30:41.307
- Yeah. Update us.
- Okay.

30:41.340 --> 30:48.915
*

30:48.948 --> 30:50.482
- Well, I think that Nathalie

30:50.516 --> 30:53.652
appreciates us coming in, so...

30:53.685 --> 30:55.287
- Yeah.
I guess.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.389
- We can still show
our support here.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.158
- I hope we're not
the only ones here.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.460
- Yeah.
Me too.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.162
- [chuckles]

31:03.195 --> 31:05.397
- We're here.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.166
- Thank you guys for coming in.
Wow.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.734
- You're welcome.
- I'm so happy.

31:08.767 --> 31:09.735
- Yeah.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.237
- I was not sure

31:11.270 --> 31:12.604
that I was gonna
go to work today.

31:12.638 --> 31:14.706
People are targeting
the gay community,

31:14.740 --> 31:17.243
and we work in the heart
of the gay community.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.411
But the fact that Brittany
wanted to go to work and said,

31:19.445 --> 31:21.580
"Listen, we're not gonna
let this stop us from working.

31:21.613 --> 31:22.949
We're gonna do this."

31:22.949 --> 31:24.951
It made me think,
my girlfriend's a real badass.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.352
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.987
- How are we doing?
- Good.

31:28.020 --> 31:35.027
*

31:37.363 --> 31:38.397
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

31:38.430 --> 31:41.200
- Hi.
- I was like, "Who is that?"

31:41.233 --> 31:42.401
- We're here.

31:42.434 --> 31:43.835
You know, the morning
started off--

31:43.869 --> 31:46.005
everybody's a little scared,
a little depressed.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.339
Little apprehensive.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.275
- Thank you
for showing up today.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.010
- But f--- that, man.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.444
I decided I'm like,
"F--- it, dude."

31:52.478 --> 31:55.181
I'm not gonna let that sh--
f---ing dictate--

31:55.214 --> 31:57.116
- And they win. They win.
- Exactly.

31:57.149 --> 32:00.286
I'm overwhelmed
with this emotion of just pride.

32:00.319 --> 32:03.022
- How many drinks do you think
fit in a pitcher?

32:03.055 --> 32:04.690
- I would say six.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.092
Maybe instead
of muddling lemons,

32:06.125 --> 32:07.893
for the next time,
maybe just use lemon juice.

32:07.994 --> 32:10.896
- I know, but I--this way I know
exactly what I'm putting in it.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.598
You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, for sure.

32:12.631 --> 32:15.267
It feels pretty petty to be
arguing over a cocktail book

32:15.301 --> 32:18.804
after this huge tragedy
that happened last night.

32:22.074 --> 32:23.509
Better be good.

32:24.710 --> 32:32.018
*

32:32.051 --> 32:33.719
- I got to get back
to the restaurant.

32:33.752 --> 32:34.720
- All right.
Go get it.

32:34.753 --> 32:37.456
- With a shot.
- Yeah! Yeah!

32:37.489 --> 32:39.291
- Cheers, mate.
Cheers, mate.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.392
- Cheers.

32:40.426 --> 32:42.328
*

32:42.361 --> 32:44.363
- Hey, me and Ariana are gonna
take a break in the back

32:44.396 --> 32:45.797
real quick.
You good?

32:45.831 --> 32:46.832
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

32:48.467 --> 32:49.768
- Whoo!

32:54.706 --> 32:56.408
- Uh, 10 bucks, I think.

32:57.776 --> 32:59.445
[laughing]

33:00.912 --> 33:02.681
- 10 bucks?
Yeah, 11 bucks.

33:02.714 --> 33:03.915
$11.

33:03.949 --> 33:11.457
*

33:11.490 --> 33:14.860
- Hey, sorry about yesterday.

33:14.893 --> 33:16.428
- I just felt like
you were kind of, like,

33:16.462 --> 33:18.430
coming at me,
and so then I started, like,

33:18.464 --> 33:20.332
just getting kind of
bitchy about it.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.068
You know, I was up
all night freaking out

33:22.101 --> 33:23.969
about everything
that's happening in Orlando,

33:24.070 --> 33:26.472
and on top of that,
it doesn't help

33:26.505 --> 33:28.740
that Tom and I
are in this fight.

33:28.774 --> 33:31.543
And it sucks.

33:31.577 --> 33:32.978
- I felt horrible about it.

33:33.079 --> 33:36.215
Like, I felt disgusting
afterwards.

33:36.248 --> 33:37.216
- Yeah.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.484
- I don't like arguing with you,

33:38.517 --> 33:41.220
and I think I just
have a lot of, like,

33:41.253 --> 33:44.190
sort of pent-up sh-- about it.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.457
- Mm-hmm.

33:45.491 --> 33:46.992
- You know,
when it comes down to it,

33:47.093 --> 33:50.496
I made this opportunity
that Ariana has

33:50.529 --> 33:51.797
about me.

33:51.830 --> 33:55.567
I mean, yes,
I'm a little bit jealous,

33:55.601 --> 33:57.836
and I should have
just been supportive

33:57.869 --> 33:59.538
and happy for her,

33:59.571 --> 34:02.241
and be proud that
she's really going after this.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.009
- And you can talk to me
about anything.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.644
- I know.
- It's always been like that.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.446
So you don't have to save it...
- Yeah.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.716
- Until you're, like,
mad about something.

34:10.749 --> 34:15.921
It feels really f---ing stupid
to be fighting over this.

34:15.954 --> 34:18.157
You know, I'd hate to say
that something

34:18.190 --> 34:19.758
like what happened in Orlando

34:19.791 --> 34:21.393
is like a wakeup call,

34:21.427 --> 34:24.363
but it is.

- Me too.

34:28.467 --> 34:29.435
I'm really glad we came.

and bullsh--...

34:33.605 --> 34:35.741
- Exactly.
- Than to come out here

34:35.774 --> 34:38.210
and have a good time together?

34:38.244 --> 34:40.979
And obviously people
are getting drunk, so...

34:41.012 --> 34:42.514
- That helps.

34:42.548 --> 34:43.782
- Coming up...

34:43.815 --> 34:45.651
- I am, like,

You made it.

what kind of scene to expect,

35:19.785 --> 35:22.053
going into Sur today,
but it's good to see

35:22.087 --> 35:24.022
that the festive spirit
has prevailed.

35:24.055 --> 35:25.257
Maybe just a sip.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.359
- Get it.

35:27.393 --> 35:29.461
- I wanted to go out
in West Hollywood

35:29.495 --> 35:31.230
and try to be a part
of the community,

35:31.263 --> 35:33.299

you know, get in there.

- Whoo!

35:40.806 --> 35:41.840

with James,

not think about the sadness

36:38.297 --> 36:39.665
that's going on around me.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.601
Has Ariana mentioned anything
to you about her birthday?

36:42.634 --> 36:44.270
- No. I'm sure I'd be invited.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.037
I mean, Ariana's
super chill with me.

36:46.071 --> 36:48.907

that they mentioned

36:48.940 --> 36:51.109
that would be a conflict is,

36:51.142 --> 36:54.746
I think Jax and Brittany
are going.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.582
- I hang out with Ariana
way more than Jax,

36:56.615 --> 36:58.116
and Jax called Ariana a ----.

36:58.149 --> 36:59.451
- But she likes Brittany.

36:59.485 --> 37:01.320
- Whatever.
F--- Jax.

If Jax wasn't going
to Ariana's birthday party,

half as pissed as I am about it.

I can't just, like,
f---ing press play now

okay with everything.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.790
- You were single last time
I was talking to you.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.792
Or were you together?
I can't even keep up anymore.

technically who he is.

38:03.615 --> 38:04.983

from Lala.

is that she's back with her ex.

is that she's dating

38:12.090 --> 38:13.759

38:13.792 --> 38:15.527
and then I've also heard
that she's single.

Four major variables

for still coming here,

a side, and she chose one.

I'm angry about Lala

of your f---ing mouth.
