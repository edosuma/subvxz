WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.002
Mobility is good.

00:02.002 --> 00:03.295
No pain?

00:04.714 --> 00:06.298
All set to go, my man.

00:07.717 --> 00:09.427
Your shoulder is coming along nice.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.596
But I wanna see you in group.

00:12.596 --> 00:13.723
Aw.

00:14.890 --> 00:17.560
There's more to healing than the physical.

00:18.144 --> 00:19.854
The guys in group,

00:19.854 --> 00:21.397
they've been through
the same stuff as you.

00:21.397 --> 00:22.982
Talking can help.

00:22.982 --> 00:26.652
Plus, we bring great pastries.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.112
Huh. All right, Doc.

00:33.284 --> 00:34.535
Is that the last patient?

00:35.536 --> 00:36.954
I have a chart for you to sign.

00:39.874 --> 00:41.959
And three more messages from Kurlander.

00:43.461 --> 00:44.545
I got nothing to say.

00:48.299 --> 00:49.633
Doing anything fun this weekend?

00:50.134 --> 00:52.011
- Work.
- That's not fun.

00:52.011 --> 00:54.889
This kind of work requires balance.
What's my first rule?

00:54.889 --> 00:56.599
Physician, heal thyself.

00:56.599 --> 00:58.809
Put that oxygen mask
on yourself first, Mitchell.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.352
Otherwise, you're just another casualty.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.687
Now, get out of here. Go have fun.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.063
Doctor's orders.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.078
Doc!

01:24.835 --> 01:27.004
No, no.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.756
No, no, no.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.050
Paul!

01:52.655 --> 01:54.490
 You never got the story right,
not once.

01:54.490 --> 01:58.285
How are you? You're so strong.
Senor, you do it.

02:02.706 --> 02:03.916
Listen to me.

02:03.916 --> 02:06.460
She wasn't the General's daughter.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.671
The girl wanted to run away with you.
She was in love with you.

02:08.671 --> 02:10.256
She was not.

02:10.256 --> 02:13.759
Why else would he have his men chase us
like dogs through a swamp?

02:13.759 --> 02:15.427
She was his wife.

02:16.428 --> 02:19.181
Oh. That makes sense.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.433
- To the General's wife.
- Yeah.

02:21.433 --> 02:24.562
Hey, here's to your clinic.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.230
That sounds amazing, man.

02:27.273 --> 02:28.858
And the fighting doesn't end
once you're back home.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.610
That's why I help the guys who need it
to make peace with their past.

02:31.610 --> 02:35.030
It was very kind of Austin Kurlander
to foot the bill, isn't it?

02:35.030 --> 02:37.032
He never struck me
as somebody that generous.

02:37.032 --> 02:41.537
Yeah, well, that's his way
of making peace with the past.

02:43.581 --> 02:46.166
What about you? Make peace with yours yet?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.251
Somewhat.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.169
- You're not getting any younger.
- I know.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.422
- Neither is he.
- I know.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.340
Two shots for you, senor.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.633
Gracias.

02:54.633 --> 02:55.843
- Salud.
- Gracias.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.139
Listen, I know I owe you one.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.225
This can't be fixed.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.852
You can try.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.939
To the road we've traveled.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.107
To the road ahead.

03:12.818 --> 03:15.279
Dr. Paul was like a scalpel.

03:15.279 --> 03:20.784
He could look at you and cut right down
to what your problems were,

03:20.784 --> 03:22.453
what you were hiding from.

03:22.453 --> 03:26.248
He believed you had to heal your past
to have a future.

03:27.082 --> 03:30.711
And he dedicated his life
to helping guys like me,

03:31.211 --> 03:32.713
like us,

03:32.713 --> 03:35.215
find the strength and clarity to do that.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.895
Excuse me, gentlemen.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.318
Are you Eliot Spencer?

03:54.985 --> 03:58.530
I recognized your photo
from Dr. Paul's office.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.783
I'm Mitchell Bukner. We worked together.

04:00.783 --> 04:04.787
Mitchell, it was
a very nice speech you gave.

04:04.787 --> 04:06.789
I didn't know him like you did.

04:06.789 --> 04:09.500
Dr. Paul told me some stories about you
and what you do now.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.293
What can I help you with, Mitchell?

04:11.293 --> 04:14.713
Help me prove the explosion
wasn't an accident.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.093
Paul was killed by Austin Kurlander.

04:25.683 --> 04:27.851
So we've got a lot on our plate.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.561
I can do this by myself. I'm not asking...

04:29.561 --> 04:32.106
- You don't have to.
- We know the risks.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.816
That said, what else do we know?

04:33.816 --> 04:36.235
Uh, well, contrary to the official report,

04:36.235 --> 04:38.529
that is not a gas leak explosion
in the center.

04:38.529 --> 04:42.199
Given the intensity of the burns,
I'd probably bet more of a MIC.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.034
- Mike who?
- Uh, M-I-C,

04:44.034 --> 04:47.454
Metastable Intermolecular Composite,
also known as a nanothermite.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.498
Enter Austin Kurlander.

04:49.498 --> 04:50.582
 Austin Kurlander?

04:50.582 --> 04:53.127
As in Austin Kurlander,
Silverguard Austin Kurlander?

04:53.127 --> 04:56.714
As in one of the most highly decorated
veterans of the Iraq War.

04:56.714 --> 05:00.342
He was awarded a Silver Star
for leading his unit away from an ambush,

05:00.342 --> 05:02.678
held a pretty strategic bridge
for about a week

05:02.678 --> 05:04.430
until reinforcements arrived.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.181
Paul Orozco.

05:08.559 --> 05:11.979
Paul was the medic in his unit and, uh...

05:17.192 --> 05:20.863
Um, so, uh, after discharge,
uh, Kurlander,

05:20.863 --> 05:22.948
he worked at a couple
of private security companies,

05:22.948 --> 05:25.576
and then he founded Silverguard,
which, as we all know, is...

05:25.576 --> 05:27.161
- Shady ass...
- ...the largest

05:27.161 --> 05:30.039
private security companies
in operation today.

05:30.039 --> 05:32.791
I mean, they have contracts
ranging from fighting our wars

05:32.791 --> 05:34.626
to protecting private American assets.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.628
They've become a minor wing of the MIC.

05:36.628 --> 05:39.339
Molecular--intermolecular and stable...

05:39.339 --> 05:41.258
And military-industrial complex.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.676
- Let's get to the bad stuff.
- I am.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.179
Whispers about scandal and corruption
have been ongoing, right?

05:45.179 --> 05:48.932
I mean, Silverguard was implicated
in that friendly fire shooting in Kabul.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.060
They've also been rumored
to guard Saudi princes,

05:51.060 --> 05:52.603
but nothing seems to stick so far.

05:52.603 --> 05:56.523
Well, private military companies are given
tremendous leeway to operate.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.276
They're not government agencies,
so federal regulations don't apply,

05:59.276 --> 06:00.652
and because there's no oversight,

06:00.652 --> 06:02.488
it's hard to bust them
when they break the law.

06:02.488 --> 06:03.781
I mean, it gets even worse.

06:03.781 --> 06:07.034
He is currently lobbying a new bill
that would allow Silverguard

06:07.034 --> 06:09.620
to do more of our nation's dirty laundry.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.456
<i>Modern wars leave no room
for a learning curve.</i>

06:12.456 --> 06:14.541
<i>It's time these duties
were carried out by professionals.</i>

06:14.541 --> 06:16.251
<i>I don't often talk about this,</i>

06:16.251 --> 06:18.879
<i>but when my unit was on that bridge
under enemy fire,</i>

06:18.879 --> 06:21.799
<i>two things kept us alive, my training,</i>

06:21.799 --> 06:25.427
<i>and knowing that my men
had each other's backs and I had theirs.</i>

06:25.427 --> 06:30.641
<i>This bill allows companies
like Silverguard to have America's back.</i>

06:30.641 --> 06:32.518
<i>Let's let professionals keep the watch</i>

06:32.518 --> 06:34.353
<i>and let all our children grow up</i>

06:34.353 --> 06:37.231
<i>with the umbrella of freedom
that will create.</i>

06:37.231 --> 06:41.527
Still waiting on my umbrella of freedom
and my shower cap of equality.

06:41.527 --> 06:44.321
So Kurlander and Dr. Paul
served in the same unit,

06:44.321 --> 06:47.199
and then Kurlander put up the money
for Paul's clinic.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.952
This Mitchell guy said that he thought
there was some tension.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.787
He said he heard them arguing
on the phone.

06:51.787 --> 06:54.832
Last week a couple of Silverguard came by
and leaned on Paul,

06:54.832 --> 06:56.416
wanted some patient files.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.503
Sounds like Kurlander had a secret
and Paul found out what it was.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.171
Let's go introduce ourselves

07:01.171 --> 07:04.341
and see if we can't peek
behind Silverguard's curtain.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.344
I think the front door is just as good.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.639
Why don't you go over to Paul's place
and see what you can find there?

07:10.639 --> 07:11.765
I'll go with you.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.811
Nobody should have to go through
a friend's things alone.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.437
When a case touches us closely,

07:17.437 --> 07:20.774
we care more, and so,
we need to be more careful.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.402
You'll get what you want.
I can promise you that.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.529
Not everything.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.917
I'm here. Breanna?

07:41.044 --> 07:42.671
Present. Parker?

07:44.047 --> 07:46.466
Here. Breanna, how we looking?

07:46.466 --> 07:47.801
<i>Stand by.</i>

07:47.801 --> 07:50.220
I am looking the feeds
in the building security system...

07:50.220 --> 07:55.350
and disabling the facial recognition
software in their lobby...

07:55.350 --> 07:59.146
and jamming those infrared sensors.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.940
They've got honeycombing
in the airspace above the roof.

08:01.940 --> 08:06.111
All while while microwaving
a bean and cheese burrito.

08:06.111 --> 08:09.114
It should take about 90 seconds.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.049
I stayed with Paul a while ago.

08:27.049 --> 08:29.092
He always left his keys here.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.558
Whoa.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.186
Looks like somebody's been here.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.443
Looked like a pretty interesting guy.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.238
When was the last time you saw him?

08:50.280 --> 08:51.531
Did he have a family?

08:51.531 --> 08:52.950
We were family.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.744
Don't!

09:17.933 --> 09:19.017
All right.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.861
Ooh, seems like Dr. Paul
was quite prepared.

09:33.198 --> 09:36.076
Yep, prepared to go after Kurlander.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.456
Ooh, ah. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot. Ah.

09:42.124 --> 09:46.295
Okay. Systems are looped,
disabled, and jammed.

09:46.295 --> 09:49.548
<i>Parker, you have about, like, 20 seconds
once you land to clear the roof.</i>

09:49.548 --> 09:51.883
The servers are conveniently
one floor down

09:51.883 --> 09:53.885
and the ventilation ducts give you
direct access.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.846
Check.

09:55.846 --> 09:59.975
Sophie--I mean, Miriam de Quadros
of Cayman National Bank.

09:59.975 --> 10:02.644
<i>I wasn't able to break
into those emails of Kurlander's.</i>

10:02.644 --> 10:05.689
<i>They're encrypted, but I did manage to get
you a meeting with Kurlander...</i>

10:05.689 --> 10:07.107
Wait.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.483
Wait? Wait.

10:08.483 --> 10:09.985
Wait? What?

10:09.985 --> 10:11.278
Why wait?

10:11.278 --> 10:12.654
He's coming out.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.199
What about the Saudi delegation?

10:16.199 --> 10:17.576
Call Amir, push that off.

10:17.576 --> 10:18.785
Clear my schedule
for the rest of the week.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.162
I'm heading to the Grove today.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.080
<i>Well, there goes our plan
to distract Kurlander</i>

10:22.080 --> 10:24.458
<i>while Parker helps me hack the servers
in the building.</i>

10:24.458 --> 10:26.460
- What do you want to do now?
- He's getting his phone out.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.879
<i>Uh, okay. If I cloned his phone,</i>

10:28.879 --> 10:30.756
<i>I could get movements, itineraries,</i>

10:30.756 --> 10:34.384
<i>and break those encrypted emails,
but, but I'm gonna need to get closer.</i>

10:34.384 --> 10:35.927
<i>Come on, then.</i>

10:35.927 --> 10:37.471
Huh? Oh, uh, okay.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.556
Oh, no. That's not the right thing.

10:39.556 --> 10:40.682
Oh, okay.

10:41.516 --> 10:42.726
General Frick, good morning.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.561
Yes, sir. I'll see to it myself.

10:44.561 --> 10:47.272
Orpheus Grove will be well-protected, sir.
I won't disappoint you.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.566
General Frick? Orpheus Grove?

10:49.566 --> 10:51.818
Did you say Orpheus Grove?

10:52.652 --> 10:56.031
He's providing security for--whoa!

10:56.031 --> 10:58.575
What is Orpheus Grove? Parker?

10:59.159 --> 11:01.036
We're about to lose them.
Breanna?

11:01.036 --> 11:03.789
Uh, I'm not gonna make it, guys.
I need more time.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.215
Jesus!

11:15.926 --> 11:17.177
Oh, my God.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.346
Let's go.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.307
That's an order.

11:22.933 --> 11:23.975
Yes, sir.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.192
Uh, Mrs. Quadros?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.819
Soph.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.862
He didn't even stop.

11:35.862 --> 11:39.491
Are you--uh, are you--have you--do you--
I just hit you with a car.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.909
I'm fine.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.536
I admit I'm a little out of practice.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.454
But where I come from,
a little grifter learns

11:44.454 --> 11:46.331
how to take a car hit before she turns 11.

11:47.249 --> 11:49.626
He didn't even hesitate.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.670
Some hero.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.967
Parker.
Nice of you to drop by.

12:05.684 --> 12:09.146
Mr. Kurlander is not our usual mark.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.482
Eliot, what did Paul find?

12:12.482 --> 12:15.902
Most of it's about a mine
that exploded last year in Venezuela,

12:15.902 --> 12:18.280
killed 35 striking workers.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.366
<i>Silverguard was providing security
for the mine.</i>

12:21.366 --> 12:23.076
In these headlines,
they read like they're an accident.

12:23.076 --> 12:27.539
"Employees of the Suarez mining company
protesting unsafe working conditions

12:27.539 --> 12:31.042
staged a peaceful sit-in
that turned tragic

12:31.042 --> 12:35.297
when a structural collapse
cut 35 protesters off from rescuers."

12:35.297 --> 12:37.841
I got a couple
of patient files here,

12:37.841 --> 12:40.969
Silverguard contractors
and patients of Dr. Paul's.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.762
Oh, man, these read like confessions.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.558
It seems that during a therapy session,
these guys kinda opened up about, uh,

12:46.558 --> 12:49.394
planting explosives in that mine
on orders from Kurlander.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.938
Paul hears that, he takes it to Kurlander.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.858
Kurlander gets nervous,
sends his guys to come get these files.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.651
And it goes even worse.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.946
Paul should have known
what was gonna come next.

12:59.946 --> 13:04.075
This ties Kurlander to the mine
and to Paul's murder.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.786
No, we've got to get close enough
to this guy to get him to talk.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.455
What is this Orpheus Grove?

13:08.455 --> 13:10.290
Ooh!

13:10.290 --> 13:11.875
My favorite conspiracy theory

13:11.875 --> 13:13.543
of all the secret society
conspiracy theories,

13:13.543 --> 13:14.711
of which there are so many

13:14.711 --> 13:17.756
that I actually theorize a conspiracy
theory behind that conspiracy, too.

13:17.756 --> 13:20.675
- One puzzle at a time, please.
- Right.

13:20.675 --> 13:24.012
Orpheus Grove was founded
after the Civil War

13:24.012 --> 13:28.266
on the grounds of a plantation owned
by Confederate General Nathaniel Frick.

13:28.266 --> 13:29.935
Hate it already.

13:29.935 --> 13:32.062
It now belongs
to his great grandson,

13:32.062 --> 13:33.688
General Lionel Frick.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.565
And for the past 140 years

13:35.565 --> 13:39.152
has served as a super-secret meeting
ground/summer retreat

13:39.152 --> 13:40.862
for America's power elite.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.364
Invitation only.

13:42.364 --> 13:45.575
No women allowed, except for staff,
of course. Ugh.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.869
And what do they do out there?

13:47.869 --> 13:50.914
<i>At night, in the woods,</i>

13:50.914 --> 13:52.791
among the trees,

13:52.791 --> 13:57.712
rumors abound of rituals and ceremonies,
and... an uncrackable safe.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.214
A safe for what?

13:59.214 --> 14:00.882
Who can know
with those secretive weirdoes?

14:00.882 --> 14:03.885
Anyway, I propose,
in addition to taking Kurlander down,

14:03.885 --> 14:06.846
we find the safe, rob of its secrets,
then burn the camp to the ground.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.056
Oh, in.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.684
Kurlander was worried about
disappointing Frick,

14:10.684 --> 14:13.395
overseeing all the security himself.

14:14.563 --> 14:15.981
This is an audition.

14:15.981 --> 14:17.440
<i>He'll be trying to impress.</i>

14:17.440 --> 14:19.526
He'll be looking out, not in.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.279
We get in, his back will be exposed.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.573
Uh, getting in
is going to be a little tricky.

14:24.573 --> 14:25.949
Look at this.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.994
- It's cloaked.
- What does that mean?

14:28.994 --> 14:31.371
Meaning there is
no satellite imaging available.

14:31.371 --> 14:35.292
They must be generating some sort
of interference from the ground.

14:35.292 --> 14:38.003
The closest cell tower here is,
like, within 10 miles away

14:38.003 --> 14:41.631
in this little town called Mills Landing.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.216
I mean, I could get set up there

14:43.216 --> 14:45.343
and try to figure out
how to disable this interference.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.803
We'd be going in blind.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.555
- Without much of a plan.
- Or an invitation.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.933
Into a heavily guarded camp
full of evil rich dudes.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.935
This party is just begging to be crashed.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.235
No.

15:05.822 --> 15:06.948
No.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.909
Well, Dr. Paul was a doctor.
How come he had all this stuff?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.661
Dr. Paul was a combat medic.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.122
A combat medic is the same as a soldier.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.915
He's just got medical training.

15:15.915 --> 15:19.711
Paul had a gift for both,
and he saved my life once.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.713
Really? When?

15:21.713 --> 15:23.840
I don't know,
we were doing recon somewhere,

15:23.840 --> 15:25.342
somewhere we probably shouldn't have been.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.344
Stuff I can't talk to you about.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.721
Somebody tipped them off. I don't know.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.181
I got hit twice.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.807
Paul carried me back to the chopper,

15:32.807 --> 15:35.727
kept me alive for 30 minutes
until we got to the base.

15:35.727 --> 15:36.728
You got shot twice?

15:36.728 --> 15:38.813
Oh, I've been shot more than twice.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.315
Like how many more times?

15:40.315 --> 15:46.863
You lose count. I wouldn't lose count.
I'm not big on pain.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.491
Yeah, well, let me
tell you something, Harry.

15:49.491 --> 15:52.494
I met more than a few cowards
in my lifetime.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.496
They're not the people you think they are.

15:54.496 --> 15:57.332
They come in loud, they come in bragging,

15:57.332 --> 16:01.920
they hide behind title,
behind rank, privilege.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.214
And I don't know if you're a hero, Harry.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.716
But I sure as hell know
you're not a coward.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.845
And I appreciate you coming here with me.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.322
Welcome.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.116
I thought you'd never come.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.450
Excuse me?

16:32.450 --> 16:37.205
You are Dr. Marjorie Rushmore
of the Shacom Institute?

16:37.205 --> 16:38.873
I'm not.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.501
Of course you aren't.
Why would you be?

16:42.669 --> 16:45.338
I write letter after letter.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.883
Does biological calamity
have to befall us all

16:48.883 --> 16:51.678
before they pay
the slightest bit of attention?

16:51.678 --> 16:55.265
You're referring to, uh,
of course, the frogs.

16:58.893 --> 17:02.021
You're familiar with the plight
of the Mississippi gopher frog?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.273
That's why I'm here.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.359
Uh, Kimberly Michaels.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.944
Uh, I'm a Tulane grad student

17:07.944 --> 17:09.988
and getting my master's
in environmental science.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.741
Oh, no.

17:12.741 --> 17:15.326
You're an angel.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.454
Maureen Chesterton Mills.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.372
I'm the local historian

17:19.372 --> 17:24.043
and the sole survivor
of this town's founding family.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.171
And the only one, it would seem,

17:26.171 --> 17:30.049
who sees the,
the extinction of the <i>Rana sevosa</i>

17:30.049 --> 17:33.386
as the greatest threat
to our national security.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.514
You are not alone.

17:36.514 --> 17:37.932
I'm here to help.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.310
May I use your Wi-Fi?

17:41.102 --> 17:44.606
Oh, uh, yes, uh, if you know how.

17:44.606 --> 17:48.485
And then, perhaps, you might help me
run off some flyers?

17:49.402 --> 17:50.570
What's a flyer?

18:00.872 --> 18:02.707
- <i>Sophie?</i>
- I can still hear you, Breanna.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.460
<i>Well, not for much longer,</i>

18:05.460 --> 18:06.920
<i>but once you pass the gate,</i>

18:06.920 --> 18:09.297
<i>the comms will still work for everyone
inside the perimeter,</i>

18:09.297 --> 18:11.466
<i>but I'll be out of reach
until I can get that cloak down.</i>

18:11.466 --> 18:12.759
We'll do our best till then.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.804
<i>Also, a clone is not gonna work
for these cloaking devices.</i>

18:15.804 --> 18:17.472
<i>But if I can get Kurlander's phone,</i>

18:17.472 --> 18:19.432
I'm betting his encrypted emails
will shed some light

18:19.432 --> 18:21.810
on whatever happened
in that Venezuelan mine.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.728
I'll manage. Good luck.

18:23.728 --> 18:24.938
Next.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.318
Where are you from?

18:30.318 --> 18:33.071
San Bartolo, outside of Mexico City.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.906
Near the ruins of Chichen Itza?

18:34.906 --> 18:35.990
No.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.076
Chichen Itza is in the Yucatan.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.953
You mean Teotihuacan.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.164
Gracias, senor.

18:46.835 --> 18:48.211
Breanna, can you hear me?

18:48.211 --> 18:50.338
Sophie? Sophie?

18:50.338 --> 18:51.673
Lost her.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.007
Parker, are you there?

18:53.007 --> 18:55.593
<i>Comms still work
inside the perimeter. I'm here.</i>

18:55.593 --> 18:57.512
And also here.

18:57.512 --> 18:58.555
Excellent.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.766
Let's go have a look around,
shall we?

19:05.520 --> 19:07.230
My God.

19:07.230 --> 19:12.485
Look at this. It's like a who's who
of the country's worst people, in caftans.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.945
Odd fashion choice.

19:13.945 --> 19:16.489
Yeah, it's like a renfaire
for men's rights activists.

19:16.489 --> 19:20.785
Got sleazy hedge fund guy
chatting it up with Mr. Private Prisons.

19:20.785 --> 19:23.872
One Chief Justice and two ministers.

19:23.872 --> 19:28.334
Hmm, there's a secretary of--
is it me, or are these guys all drunk?

19:28.334 --> 19:30.378
They do seem fairly inebriated.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.588
<i>Sophie.</i>

19:31.588 --> 19:34.799
And also to be urinating
wherever they please.

19:34.799 --> 19:35.967
Gross!

19:35.967 --> 19:38.636
This isn't quite the cabal of evil
I was expecting.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.054
The day is young.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.723
Let's find Kurlander.

19:41.723 --> 19:44.434
Breanna said she can work wonders
with his physical phone.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.355
Care to make a wager?

19:49.355 --> 19:52.442
First to lift Kurlander's phone gets what?

19:55.653 --> 19:57.614
Winner picks the restaurant, loser pays.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.407
Fun.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.826
It was worse than you can imagine.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.912
Two things kept us alive,

20:03.912 --> 20:07.290
my training and a voice in my head saying,

20:07.290 --> 20:09.000
"Forget your wounds.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.879
These men have your back,
so you have theirs."

20:12.879 --> 20:16.007
The edge of death
is where a man feels most alive.

20:16.007 --> 20:18.009
Wouldn't you say, General?

20:18.009 --> 20:22.597
I'm not as fond of talking about my time
in combat as you are, Austin.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.807
Um, they asked.

20:24.807 --> 20:28.102
Actually, I was just asking when
you were gonna blow the ram's horn?

20:28.102 --> 20:30.188
Shortly, Senator.

20:30.188 --> 20:32.357
- Ooh!
- Oh. Oh.

20:32.357 --> 20:36.945
Oh, look at that,
I, I just dropped everything.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.655
I didn't hurt you, did I?

20:38.655 --> 20:41.658
Ma'am, four-star generals
don't bruise very easily.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.201
Are, are you all right?

20:43.201 --> 20:44.911
Pick those up
and be more careful.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.079
This is Orpheus Grove,

20:46.079 --> 20:48.289
staff are hired
to be efficient and invisible.

20:48.289 --> 20:51.042
I'll fetch fresh linens right away.

20:51.042 --> 20:54.212
But please, sir, I cannot lose this job.

20:54.212 --> 20:56.798
I don't know what I'd do.

20:56.798 --> 20:59.842
First, little Roscoe and now this.

20:59.842 --> 21:05.348
Austin, sometimes there's more honor
in showing humanity than talking about it.

21:05.348 --> 21:08.059
And you are not gonna lose this job,
I promise.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.895
Are you acquainted
with the gentleman in charge?

21:10.895 --> 21:15.817
Madam, I <i>am</i> the gentleman in charge.

21:15.817 --> 21:17.276
Ohh.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.890
Orpheans, as many of you know,

21:47.890 --> 21:50.977
my great-great grandfather
founded this society

21:50.977 --> 21:52.937
140 years ago

21:52.937 --> 21:56.649
to provide a haven
for men of industry to come together,

21:56.649 --> 21:59.360
to set aside the business
of everyday life,

21:59.360 --> 22:01.779
away from prying eyes,

22:01.779 --> 22:06.159
and to indulge in the rhythms
of nature and the fellowship of men.

22:06.159 --> 22:09.162
Gentlemen,
I welcome you back to the Grove.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.668
This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen.

22:16.961 --> 22:20.131
Per tradition, to promote
the fraternity among members

22:20.131 --> 22:22.050
and to eliminate distraction,

22:22.050 --> 22:24.844
all phones, tablets, and computers

22:24.844 --> 22:26.596
will be placed under lock and key

22:26.596 --> 22:29.974
inside the big tree for the duration
of your time here.

22:29.974 --> 22:32.018
Please pass them forward now.

22:32.018 --> 22:35.938
My safe in the tree?!

22:49.327 --> 22:52.789
Our little wager
just got a little more complicated.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.386
Everything just got more complicated.

23:21.192 --> 23:22.902
Hola, amigo.

23:22.902 --> 23:26.197
Son of a bitch, I thought you were dead.

23:26.197 --> 23:28.616
It's Paul. Dr. not dead Paul.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.493
Ooh, that is a twist.

23:30.493 --> 23:33.412
- How?
- Um, explosives at the center,

23:33.412 --> 23:35.790
we wired them to blow up
after the building was empty.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.166
Kurlander is not who who you think he is.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.417
I know about the mine.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.336
It's not just the mine.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.338
It's all built on a lie.

23:43.464 --> 23:44.966
That mission on the bridge,

23:46.342 --> 23:47.718
it got hot.

23:47.718 --> 23:50.263
Kurlander froze and four guys got killed.

23:51.264 --> 23:53.266
After, he gave me a choice.

23:53.266 --> 23:57.061
Write it up the way it went down,
or tell another story.

23:57.061 --> 23:59.188
And if we told another story...

23:59.188 --> 24:00.606
He would take care of you.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.275
And you did it?

24:03.693 --> 24:05.570
Did you--did you do it?

24:05.570 --> 24:07.446
He got a Silver Star.

24:09.031 --> 24:10.241
And I got the clinic.

24:10.241 --> 24:11.784
And you couldn't tell me.

24:11.784 --> 24:15.037
I hooked up with those guys
after everything we went through.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.372
Things got dark.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.082
I just followed the wound in front of me.

24:18.082 --> 24:21.169
When he offered to pay for the clinic,

24:21.169 --> 24:23.212
I thought the ends justified the means.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.964
I could help a lot of guys.

24:26.632 --> 24:29.594
But he just got more and more powerful,

24:29.594 --> 24:30.928
hurting more and more people.

24:30.928 --> 24:34.015
- Time to take him out.
- No, no. Why, why didn't you tell me?

24:34.015 --> 24:35.600
Me?

24:38.186 --> 24:39.645
You wouldn't have lied.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.107
Stolen valor?

24:48.946 --> 24:50.531
I was ashamed that I did.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.745
I'm sorry, Eliot.

24:55.745 --> 24:56.662
Come here.

25:00.666 --> 25:01.667
Okay.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.087
Hi. I'm Harry. I'm with him.

25:05.087 --> 25:07.423
Glad you're not dead. What do we do now?

25:09.175 --> 25:11.219
We get Kurlander.

25:11.219 --> 25:12.720
Not like that.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.889
- Sophie?
- <i>I'm here.</i>

25:14.889 --> 25:17.975
Okay. Kurlander needs to be discredited.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.731
The General
reprimanded him for lacking honor.

25:23.731 --> 25:25.942
If we can get him to confess
to stolen valor

25:25.942 --> 25:27.526
in front of a specific audience,

25:27.526 --> 25:31.364
then he stands to lose
both his benefactor and his army.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.574
- <i>Any ideas?</i>
- I'm still working on it.

25:33.574 --> 25:35.034
Eliot, I'll prime Kurlander.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.994
<i>You take out as many of his guards
as you can.</i>

25:36.994 --> 25:39.163
And Parker,
three men are wearing three keys

25:39.163 --> 25:42.124
that open three locks
to a heavily guarded safe.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.377
I could kiss you.

25:44.377 --> 25:45.753
Breanna, do we have you yet?

25:45.753 --> 25:47.046
<i>Uh, just joined.</i>

25:47.046 --> 25:49.799
Okay. So, the cloak is lifted

25:49.799 --> 25:53.010
and I have signals and images on you all.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.679
Bet you guys didn't know
that you are standing

25:54.679 --> 25:56.847
on the only remaining spawning ground

25:56.847 --> 25:59.600
of the endangered Mississippi gopher frog.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.477
And their immune system

26:01.477 --> 26:04.397
may hold the secret
for eliminating bacterial infections.

26:04.397 --> 26:06.732
I mean, I am learning a lot here.

26:06.732 --> 26:10.861
Kimberly Michaels,
you really are an answered prayer.

26:10.861 --> 26:13.906
Where did you get
all of these volunteers from?

26:13.906 --> 26:15.116
The internet.

26:15.116 --> 26:17.118
I, I posted your flyers
where more people could see them.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.035
Oh.

26:18.035 --> 26:21.163
Ms. Mills, there's a local news reporter
asking for you,

26:21.163 --> 26:23.916
and we're ready to start testing
those water and soil samples.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.418
Oh, excellent.

26:25.418 --> 26:29.463
Perhaps we can finally identify
what's raising the PH levels.

26:29.463 --> 26:32.717
Oh. The spawning season is crucial!

26:33.926 --> 26:35.428
Can I have this?

26:35.428 --> 26:36.679
<i>Alpha team,</i>

26:36.679 --> 26:39.265
<i>be on the lookout for foreign objects
on the trail. Over.</i>

27:00.745 --> 27:02.288
Whoo, that was cool!

27:02.288 --> 27:03.831
If you guys need any help
with the next ones, let me know.

27:03.831 --> 27:05.041
I'm ready to go.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.667
I thought you didn't like pain.

27:08.002 --> 27:09.462
You can tie that guy up.

27:10.921 --> 27:14.467
Find your celebrity to front it,
and start a SPAC.

27:14.467 --> 27:18.429
With the opt outs and warrants,
big upside, zero risk.

27:18.429 --> 27:21.599
If you're first in, your first out.

27:29.398 --> 27:30.858
Ohh...

27:31.484 --> 27:34.111
We held that bridge for a week.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.654
A week.

27:38.199 --> 27:41.577
Braddock, grab me another walkie.

27:41.577 --> 27:43.037
What's happening out there?

27:43.037 --> 27:44.872
Quiet. Not a word.

27:44.872 --> 27:46.499
Double the perimeter patrols anyway.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.667
It's good optics
for the guests to see us looking vigilant.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.877
Yes, sir.

27:49.877 --> 27:52.713
Do not tell me this is your idea of clean.

27:52.713 --> 27:55.216
This is Orpheus Grove.

27:55.216 --> 27:56.467
Well, I'm sorry, missus.

27:56.467 --> 27:58.928
Staff here are hired
to be efficient and invisible.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.596
These are the most powerful men.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.765
You have to show them
the respect they deserve.

28:04.392 --> 28:06.477
Oh, Mr. Kurlander,

28:06.477 --> 28:09.021
I'm so sorry you had to hear that.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.774
As you can see,
I took your words to heart.

28:11.774 --> 28:13.651
Excellent. I like that.

28:13.651 --> 28:16.737
I couldn't help overhearing earlier.

28:16.737 --> 28:21.158
You were talking of your heroic exploits.

28:21.158 --> 28:22.827
I so admire your courage.

28:22.827 --> 28:24.537
Thank you.

28:24.537 --> 28:27.415
I don't often speak
about my role in the war.

28:27.415 --> 28:29.333
Reliving it must be so harrowing.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.544
It is. Hmm.

28:31.544 --> 28:34.171
I was about to do a perimeter check.

28:34.171 --> 28:37.258
- Care to join me?
- Well, I'd be honored.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.720
We were pinned down on that bridge.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.682
It was the hottest day of the year
and my men were under heavy fire.

28:45.891 --> 28:48.394
<i>Bravo team,
we've lost Alpha.</i>

28:48.394 --> 28:51.272
<i>Keep on the lookout
for anything suspicious.</i>

29:23.137 --> 29:24.054
Nice move.

29:24.054 --> 29:25.306
Thank you.

29:30.644 --> 29:31.896
You call that pressure?

29:31.896 --> 29:33.606
Is that the best you can do?

29:42.907 --> 29:44.783
All right. Where's Harry?

29:44.783 --> 29:46.368
Where's my ghillie suit?

30:16.398 --> 30:17.942
Ooh.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.640
I said to myself, forget your wounds.

30:49.640 --> 30:53.352
These men have your back,
so you have theirs.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.145
- Now, two things were...
- Sir,

30:55.145 --> 30:56.939
we're not getting Alpha or Bravo teams
on the radio.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.482
Something's up.

31:00.985 --> 31:03.654
- I saw her in the building.
- Enact red level protocols.

31:03.654 --> 31:04.905
Yes, sir.

31:06.824 --> 31:07.700
Join me.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.326
I think you'll find this
quite fascinating.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.836
Give us a 10.

31:20.588 --> 31:23.591
- Wow.
- Mm, for a rural camp,

31:23.591 --> 31:25.467
our security system
is quite sophisticated.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.805
You see,
I pride myself on attention to detail.

31:31.432 --> 31:33.142
It's the cornerstone of my success.

31:35.519 --> 31:36.937
I don't miss much.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.442
So...

31:44.153 --> 31:45.321
who the hell are you?

31:56.165 --> 31:58.417
You were outside my office,
and now you're here.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.629
Who are you?

32:03.088 --> 32:06.842
"Attention to detail
is the cornerstone of my success."

32:08.636 --> 32:11.055
No wonder your house is crumbling.

32:12.139 --> 32:13.599
Special agent Nina Velasquez

32:13.599 --> 32:16.644
of SEBIN, Bolivarian Security Service,

32:16.644 --> 32:19.855
here on behalf of Suarez Mining, Inc.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.400
My employers are concerned.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.818
That's handled.

32:24.818 --> 32:27.863
The two contractors have been redeployed
and the doctor has been dealt with.

32:27.863 --> 32:29.782
Si.

32:29.782 --> 32:33.494
You dealt with the doctor
and you summoned a demon.

32:33.494 --> 32:36.914
The doctor was friends with Eliot Spencer.

32:38.082 --> 32:40.125
I can see by the blood
draining from your face

32:40.125 --> 32:43.045
that you are familiar with Mr. Spencer.

32:43.045 --> 32:48.133
Your Alpha and Bravo teams
are MIA because he's here now,

32:48.133 --> 32:51.095
an avenging angel of death

32:52.137 --> 32:54.890
unleashed by your carelessness.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.434
The man shows no mercy.

32:57.434 --> 32:58.977
He feels no pain.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.771
He never tires. He...

33:00.771 --> 33:03.023
Sir, we found this man
in the woods unarmed.

33:03.023 --> 33:05.401
He won't talk, but we still can't reach
Alpha or Bravo teams.

33:05.401 --> 33:06.568
It's like they disappeared.

33:09.363 --> 33:13.158
So, the infamous Eliot Spencer.

33:20.082 --> 33:21.917
Excuse me, sir. Sir?

33:23.168 --> 33:25.087
May I direct your attention to the plaque?

33:25.087 --> 33:26.714
There's no urinating near the big tree...

33:28.841 --> 33:30.384
Ha!

33:31.427 --> 33:33.345
Ooh.

33:36.181 --> 33:38.183
You have to turn all three at once.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.061
Hey, fella, wanna lend me a hand?

33:51.655 --> 33:55.701
Eliot Spencer, I tried to hire you, twice.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.369
You never responded.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.413
I understand
you and Paul Orozco were close.

33:59.413 --> 34:01.331
Killing him hurt, as you can imagine.

34:01.331 --> 34:04.501
I say "imagine"
because I hear you feel no pain.

34:06.128 --> 34:09.047
Stop. He's toying with you.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.799
Why do you think he gave himself up?

34:10.799 --> 34:12.593
He already broke into your safe.

34:12.593 --> 34:14.094
And why would he do that?

34:14.094 --> 34:17.681
To get the phones of the most powerful men
in the country to discredit you.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.475
You're the security.

34:19.475 --> 34:20.976
Is she right?

34:27.691 --> 34:29.234
I'll tell you something, Kurlander.

34:30.986 --> 34:33.405
I've known a lot of cowards in my time.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.532
They aren't always who you think they are.

34:35.532 --> 34:39.369
Mostly they come loud
and they come bragging,

34:39.369 --> 34:42.873
hiding behind title, rank, and privilege.

34:42.873 --> 34:46.251
I don't know if you're a hero, Kurlander...

34:46.251 --> 34:48.253
but I know when I smell a coward.

34:50.672 --> 34:51.840
I might be a coward.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.635
But that's why I have an army.

34:57.387 --> 34:59.097
Kill him when I leave.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.686
You're coming with me.
Let's go take a look at that safe.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.623
Oh, is this the kind
of thing you boys thought you'd be doing

35:24.623 --> 35:26.542
when you joined Silverguard?

35:29.419 --> 35:33.048
It's nothing personal.
They're Kurlander's orders.

35:33.048 --> 35:36.134
Do you know there's a code of conduct
that exists among men of valor?

35:38.011 --> 35:40.013
I mean,

35:40.013 --> 35:45.435
the world
is not all sunshine and rainbows.

35:45.435 --> 35:47.396
It's a mean and nasty place.

35:47.396 --> 35:49.606
And I don't care how tough you are,

35:49.606 --> 35:51.233
it'll beat you down to the ground

35:51.233 --> 35:54.027
and keep you there
permanently if you let it.

35:54.027 --> 35:55.863
You, me,

35:55.863 --> 35:58.657
nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.910
But it ain't about how hard you hit,

36:01.910 --> 36:06.290
it's about how hard you can get hit
and keep on moving forward, because--

36:06.290 --> 36:08.208
Is that from <i>Rocky</i> ?

36:19.344 --> 36:20.512
I got one like that.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.015
What the hell was that voice?

36:31.815 --> 36:33.358
He must have hidden it all in the woods.

36:33.358 --> 36:35.402
Start searching around the area
where he was found.

36:35.402 --> 36:37.112
- Go!
- Yes, sir.

36:39.072 --> 36:42.367
Thanks for stopping me out there.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.494
Physician, heal thyself.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.665
Ain't that what you used to say?

36:48.665 --> 36:53.795
You can't do that by killing Kurlander
or running away.

36:55.422 --> 36:58.926
You gotta own your part,
starting right now.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.686
Senor Suarez will not be happy.

37:09.686 --> 37:11.355
There's no coming back from this.

37:11.355 --> 37:13.523
Chaos can be reframed into opportunity,

37:13.523 --> 37:15.734
a skill I picked up
in battle and I have been...

37:15.734 --> 37:17.486
Playing it ever since.

37:19.863 --> 37:22.032
Paul, how?

37:22.032 --> 37:25.994
You were never smart,
Austin, mistake after mistake.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.871
When bodies stacked up,

37:27.871 --> 37:30.707
you climbed them like stairs
right to the top.

37:30.707 --> 37:32.834
That's what soldiers are for!

37:32.834 --> 37:34.503
They're disposable!

37:34.503 --> 37:37.381
They're pieces in the game
to be sacrificed for position,

37:37.381 --> 37:39.091
just like the men that came crying to you!

37:39.091 --> 37:42.177
This is the doctor?
You said you dealt with him.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.428
I'll deal with him now.

37:43.428 --> 37:45.639
And you'll tell Senor Suarez
I did so to protect our friendship.

37:47.182 --> 37:49.267
Yeah, that's not gonna happen today.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.769
Uh, pardon me, General.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.145
You didn't happen to see those guys

37:52.145 --> 37:53.897
messing with the ram's horn
by the big tree?

37:53.897 --> 37:55.315
They seemed a little drunk.

37:55.315 --> 37:57.693
Holy hell. I'll be right back.

37:58.819 --> 37:59.903
Eliot, no.

37:59.903 --> 38:01.530
So you're Spencer.

38:01.530 --> 38:03.782
And you're gonna have
to pull that trigger yourself this time.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.826
Shut up. You don't know anything.

38:05.826 --> 38:08.954
I know that even if you tell a lie
over a thousand times,

38:08.954 --> 38:10.455
it doesn't make it the truth.

38:10.455 --> 38:11.707
What truth?

38:11.707 --> 38:13.041
That we stole valor.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.793
So what?

38:14.793 --> 38:17.170
What was I supposed to do?

38:17.170 --> 38:19.047
Admit that I got four of my men killed?

38:19.047 --> 38:21.383
They were dead! They're not coming back!

38:21.383 --> 38:23.468
We're the only ones
who knew what really happened.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.345
And after today...

38:30.934 --> 38:32.602
These are the most powerful men.

38:32.602 --> 38:35.147
You have to show them
the respect they deserve.

38:37.607 --> 38:41.361
Mr. Kurlander,
I'm so sorry you had to hear that.

38:45.574 --> 38:48.160
Excellent performance.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.537
And in front of an audience, no less.

38:50.537 --> 38:54.666
Austin, who are these people
and what the hell have you done now?

38:54.666 --> 38:56.710
General, it's under control!

38:56.710 --> 38:58.086
Not from where I'm standing.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.630
My, my.

39:00.630 --> 39:02.591
I've been waiting for you to slip, Austin,

39:02.591 --> 39:05.218
dancing between the raindrops
the way you do.

39:05.218 --> 39:07.888
And now you've gone
and made a mess in my house.

39:07.888 --> 39:10.807
I'll clean it, but it's gonna cost you.

39:10.807 --> 39:14.227
From now on,
you will dance to the tune that I play.

39:14.227 --> 39:18.356
Unfortunately, it means that none
of y'all can leave the Grove alive.

39:23.820 --> 39:26.740
Now, you get your men,

39:26.740 --> 39:29.284
you take these people out back,
and dispose of them.

39:29.284 --> 39:32.370
Braddock, this is Big Dog. Come in. Over.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.705
Braddock?

39:34.956 --> 39:37.042
Braddock?

39:43.381 --> 39:46.218
<i>That's what soldiers are for.
They're disposable.</i>

39:46.218 --> 39:49.262
<i>Pieces in the game
to be sacrificed for position.</i>

39:49.262 --> 39:51.807
<i>What was I supposed to do?
Admit that I got four of my men killed?</i>

39:51.807 --> 39:54.351
<i>They were dead! They're not coming back.</i>

39:55.352 --> 39:58.480
I'm sorry, you didn't think
I meant that the General

39:58.480 --> 40:00.524
was your audience, did you?

40:05.946 --> 40:07.114
Coming down, Sophie.

40:09.157 --> 40:10.408
Nicely done.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.785
Thanks.

40:11.785 --> 40:14.830
I like hot dogs in Detroit with mayo.

40:14.830 --> 40:16.081
Book the tickets.

40:16.706 --> 40:17.541
Mayo?

40:18.250 --> 40:20.836
Braddock! Have my car
brought around to the security gate.

40:20.836 --> 40:22.546
The General and I are leaving.

40:23.255 --> 40:25.924
"Pieces to be sacrificed for position."

40:27.092 --> 40:29.427
Whatever happened to having our backs?

40:39.855 --> 40:41.731
I want these people arrested immediately.

40:41.731 --> 40:43.775
Trespassing, theft, attempted murder.

40:44.401 --> 40:46.236
- Don't just stay there, that's an order!
- What a minute.

40:46.236 --> 40:49.030
These gentlemen are employed
under a general service contract.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.574
- Is that right, Harry?
- That's correct.

40:50.574 --> 40:52.534
So they're under no obligation whatsoever

40:52.534 --> 40:54.911
to follow an order they may deem illegal
or unethical?

40:54.911 --> 40:56.163
None whatsoever.

40:56.163 --> 40:58.623
In fact, being asked to commit an illegal
or unethical act would fall

40:58.623 --> 41:02.127
outside of any confidentiality agreement
they might have signed and they can sue.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.336
Huh.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.423
You men have anything to say?

41:06.423 --> 41:07.507
We quit.

41:13.763 --> 41:15.765
Let's see if you can hold this bridge.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.441
Save the frogs.

41:24.441 --> 41:26.860
- Save the frogs.
- There he is.

41:26.860 --> 41:28.278
That's General Frick.

41:28.278 --> 41:29.529
He's in charge.

41:29.529 --> 41:30.906
Maureen, what are you up to now?

41:30.906 --> 41:31.948
We got you.

41:31.948 --> 41:34.868
It's taken years,
but I finally have the proof.

41:34.868 --> 41:36.453
This woman is insane.

41:36.453 --> 41:40.540
She's been peddling this cockamamie notion
about frogs since we were children.

41:40.540 --> 41:43.168
And what does any of that have to do
with the Grove?

41:43.168 --> 41:45.378
Something is killing them

41:45.378 --> 41:47.797
during the most crucial stage
of metamorphosis.

41:47.797 --> 41:51.343
Soil and water samples
show a high level of urea, sodium,

41:51.343 --> 41:53.595
- potassium, and creatinine.
- So?

41:53.595 --> 41:56.097
So that means
you're pissing on the eggs, dude.

41:57.057 --> 41:58.642
This is a temporary injunction.

41:58.642 --> 42:02.270
This land must be vacated immediately
pending an investigation.

42:02.270 --> 42:05.398
You can't do this.
Who cares about a bunch of frogs?

42:05.398 --> 42:07.484
Frogs are not your biggest problem.

42:07.484 --> 42:11.404
Interesting thing happened when I,
I took down that perimeter interference.

42:11.404 --> 42:13.448
It made all your walkie talkie
channels public.

42:13.448 --> 42:15.617
That means
pretty much anyone can listen in,

42:15.617 --> 42:17.118
even local police radio.

42:19.079 --> 42:20.372
And news van scanners.

42:20.372 --> 42:21.957
...has organized a massive protest...

42:21.957 --> 42:23.667
This way, General.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.335
They're gonna have some questions
for you, General.

42:25.335 --> 42:27.254
It's in your best interest to answer them.

42:27.254 --> 42:29.214
No, no, no, no. You don't understand.

42:29.214 --> 42:31.675
I'm a hero. I'm a hero!

42:31.675 --> 42:34.010
I have a Silver Star!

42:35.136 --> 42:36.638
<i>The walls of the Pentagon shook</i>

42:36.638 --> 42:40.183
<i>with the arrest of Silverguard founder
Austin Kurlander</i>

42:40.183 --> 42:42.352
<i>and retired General Lionel Frick.</i>

42:42.352 --> 42:47.065
<i>Kurlander is now the center
of a bipartisan Senate investigation</i>

42:47.065 --> 42:50.652
<i>into corruption, fraud, extortion,
and murder.</i>

42:51.778 --> 42:54.072
This is the way the world ends.

42:54.072 --> 42:56.449
Not with a bang, but a whimper.

42:56.449 --> 42:57.367
Who said that?

42:57.367 --> 42:58.285
Eliot.

42:58.285 --> 42:59.202
Our Eliot?

42:59.786 --> 43:00.662
T.S. Eliot.

43:00.662 --> 43:01.997
- Oh.
- Hey.

43:01.997 --> 43:03.915
So, what's that frog lady
gonna do without you now?

43:03.915 --> 43:05.542
Mm, she didn't really need me.

43:05.542 --> 43:07.961
I think she just needed a push
into the 21st century.

43:07.961 --> 43:10.130
Thanks to her,
Orpheus Grove is now a certified

43:10.130 --> 43:12.841
protected sanctuary
for the Mississippi gopher frog.

43:12.841 --> 43:15.510
Hey, hey, serious blow to the MIC.

43:15.510 --> 43:17.178
Wait, the military-industrial complex?

43:17.178 --> 43:18.722
Men in caftans.

43:18.722 --> 43:20.598
And we got Kurlander's phone

43:20.598 --> 43:23.018
along with the phones
of all the top cretins in the country.

43:23.018 --> 43:24.853
These should come in handy.

43:24.853 --> 43:27.063
Nice. We're gonna have fun with these.

43:27.981 --> 43:29.232
Wait, where's Eliot?

43:29.232 --> 43:31.568
He's outside saying goodbye to Paul.

43:32.819 --> 43:34.195
I said I'd testify.

43:35.238 --> 43:37.824
And once I did, I felt the darkness lift.

43:37.824 --> 43:40.035
Well, you carried that weight a long time.

43:40.035 --> 43:41.369
Yeah.

43:42.287 --> 43:44.372
It's a pretty nice outfit you got here.

43:45.498 --> 43:47.834
If you ever need a badass Latino medic,
give me a call.

43:49.544 --> 43:52.130
Well, you got a clinic to run, my man.

43:52.130 --> 43:53.923
You should come down.

43:53.923 --> 43:55.675
Swinging a hammer is good therapy.

43:55.675 --> 43:56.593
That right?

43:57.302 --> 43:59.054
Clears away the skeletons.

43:59.929 --> 44:03.308
I know--I know you said
that can't be fixed.

44:03.308 --> 44:04.642
I'm not even gonna try.

44:05.477 --> 44:06.895
Well, maybe I can try.

44:11.524 --> 44:12.859
To the road we've traveled.

44:16.237 --> 44:17.697
To the road ahead.

45:06.079 --> 45:09.040
Please, just, just stay a little longer.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.084
This town, it's worth fighting for.

45:11.084 --> 45:13.461
I've been working to shut
that fracking rig down.

45:17.340 --> 45:20.969
This is the operator of GreenSlate Energy.

45:20.969 --> 45:22.720
<i>These are the guys running the study,</i>

45:22.720 --> 45:25.765
<i>and all the backgrounds
of people running it, shady.</i>

45:28.226 --> 45:29.936
<i>I poured all my money into that rig</i>

45:29.936 --> 45:31.438
<i>It is time it start giving back.</i>

45:31.438 --> 45:32.397
Fix it!

45:32.397 --> 45:34.732
We just wanna show him
what fracking can do.
