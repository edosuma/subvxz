WEBVTT

04:21.099 --> 04:23.852
I think it's perfect.

04:30.539 --> 04:33.131
I made it for you.

04:33.162 --> 04:37.995
When I can't watch over
you both, he will.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.882
As he always does.

05:29.739 --> 05:32.651
You sure I can't
persuade you to stay?

05:35.562 --> 05:37.803
I wish I could.

05:44.492 --> 05:46.955
I don't like it when you leave.

05:47.691 --> 05:50.891
Especially with what's
going on out there.

06:00.716 --> 06:02.668
I won't be long, love.

06:16.236 --> 06:17.996
That's it. It's all there.

06:18.028 --> 06:19.820
Good man.

06:19.852 --> 06:21.899
Oh, thanks, Ben.

06:37.963 --> 06:40.876
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

06:40.907 --> 06:42.666
Joseph.

06:42.700 --> 06:43.787
-Squire.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.972
-How's that family of yours?

06:45.003 --> 06:46.219
Very well.

06:46.251 --> 06:47.979
In times like these,
that's blessing enough.

06:48.012 --> 06:49.803
- In times like these,
I wouldn't let a woman

06:49.836 --> 06:51.596
like Grave out of my sight.

06:51.627 --> 06:53.547
Here, let me light your pipe.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.668
Oh, thank you.

06:54.699 --> 06:56.363
-Leave him be, Leonora.

06:56.396 --> 06:58.572
He's a married man.

07:10.315 --> 07:12.171
Jesus.

07:30.123 --> 07:31.916
Joseph?

07:31.947 --> 07:33.803
It's okay my love.
Just go back to bed.

07:35.627 --> 07:39.371
No, Grace. Stay where you are.
Don't come any closer.

07:39.403 --> 07:42.380
Joseph, you're scaring me.
What's wrong?

07:42.412 --> 07:44.459
Don't touch me! Please.

07:44.492 --> 07:47.083
Oh, my God. It's the sickness.

07:47.116 --> 07:48.332
I just have a fever is all.

07:48.363 --> 07:51.116
I don't want you and Abby
succumbing to it.

07:51.147 --> 07:52.459
All right.

07:52.491 --> 07:56.747
I'll go to the forest to fetch
some elderberry

07:56.780 --> 07:58.059
to make a tonic.

07:58.092 --> 08:00.716
That should help
break the fever.

08:04.300 --> 08:09.292
Grace... Grace.

08:09.323 --> 08:12.172
I love you.

08:12.203 --> 08:14.348
Won't be long.

11:03.243 --> 11:06.252
Sorry. The squire wants
a word with you.

11:06.283 --> 11:08.811
- Squire?
- Mrs. Haverstock.

11:08.843 --> 11:10.859
You don't usually make
house calls.

11:10.891 --> 11:12.716
Well, I heard rumor
that your husband

11:12.747 --> 11:14.955
had succumbed to the sickness.

11:14.988 --> 11:17.260
Such a pity that he should be
cut down in his prime.

11:17.291 --> 11:20.363
But then the Lord moves
in mysterious ways.

11:20.396 --> 11:21.675
That he does.

11:21.708 --> 11:24.971
And what of yourself
and the child?

11:25.003 --> 11:29.355
We must wait it out in solitude
and pray the Lord has spared us.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.979
And if you do find yourself
in his favor, what then?

11:32.011 --> 11:33.931
Surely you don't mean
to persist out here,

11:33.963 --> 11:36.811
a frail young woman alone
in this isolated place?

11:36.843 --> 11:38.796
I'm not alone.
I have my daughter.

11:38.827 --> 11:41.483
And there is work to be done.
I must persist.

11:41.516 --> 11:42.828
I see.

11:42.859 --> 11:45.195
And I trust you'll be able
to pay the rent.

11:45.227 --> 11:48.331
It's due in a week, and if you
cannot fulfill your obligation,

11:48.363 --> 11:49.995
your tenancy will be forfeit.

11:50.027 --> 11:51.468
You'll lose everything.

11:51.499 --> 11:54.156
Your sympathy at this difficult
time is the most touching.

11:54.187 --> 11:55.243
Mind your tongue, woman.

11:55.275 --> 11:57.195
My sympathies lie
where I choose.

11:57.228 --> 11:59.660
This is business
and nothing more.

11:59.691 --> 12:01.419
We all have our stations
in life,

12:01.451 --> 12:03.659
and I'm sorry that yours is
beneath mine, but there it is.

12:03.691 --> 12:04.875
I'll come back.
If you're still alive,

12:04.908 --> 12:06.860
I shall expect
the rent paid in full.

12:06.892 --> 12:10.443
If not, well, then we'll
call it quits.

12:10.476 --> 12:12.907
Don't worry, Squire.

12:12.939 --> 12:15.435
You'll have your money.

13:53.324 --> 13:56.043
It happened this time.

13:56.076 --> 13:58.891
I'm sure of it.

13:58.923 --> 14:01.611
Sure of what?

14:01.643 --> 14:02.988
Of a child.

14:03.020 --> 14:05.804
How could you possibly
know that?

14:05.836 --> 14:09.163
A woman just knows these things.

14:30.443 --> 14:33.163
Come here.

14:33.195 --> 14:35.147
Come here.

15:05.739 --> 15:06.795
Kate?

15:06.827 --> 15:08.683
Grace?

15:13.515 --> 15:14.571
Oh.

15:14.603 --> 15:15.820
It's all right, Kate.

15:15.852 --> 15:17.740
We've gone a week now
and showed no signs.

15:17.772 --> 15:19.563
All the same, Kate,
it might be wise to keep...

15:19.596 --> 15:21.772
- Thank the Lord.
- Never mind.

15:21.804 --> 15:24.299
When we heard the news,
we feared the worst.

15:24.331 --> 15:26.444
We're glad to see that
you're all right.

15:26.476 --> 15:28.043
We're very sorry
to hear about Joseph.

15:28.075 --> 15:29.260
He were a good friend.

15:29.292 --> 15:31.180
Thank you, Morton.
That means a lot.

15:31.212 --> 15:33.228
- Where are you going?
- I have to go into town.

15:33.260 --> 15:35.148
Grace, no!
It's too dangerous.

15:35.180 --> 15:38.347
The sickness is rife there.
Morton, she's going into town.

15:38.379 --> 15:40.683
Well, why would you want to do
a damn fool thing like that?

15:40.715 --> 15:42.347
I have no choice.

15:42.379 --> 15:43.531
That's something I must do.

15:43.563 --> 15:46.123
Then leave Abby with me.

15:46.155 --> 15:47.371
- No.
- You can ride faster

15:47.403 --> 15:49.899
and be back sooner.

15:49.931 --> 15:51.115
Very well.

15:51.147 --> 15:53.260
You and Morton have been
like family to me

15:53.292 --> 15:55.083
ever since I came here.

15:55.116 --> 15:59.116
Then take some sisterly advice
and don't dally.

15:59.148 --> 16:02.603
The shadow of death
hangs over that place.

16:02.635 --> 16:05.515
Come on.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.315
I won't be there a moment
longer necessary.

16:12.363 --> 16:14.923
I'll be back before dark.

17:54.380 --> 17:56.076
Mr. Tuttle?

17:56.108 --> 17:59.084
Aye? That's right.

17:59.116 --> 18:02.442
You don't know me, but you were
a friend of my husband's,

18:02.475 --> 18:04.267
Joseph Haverstock.

18:04.299 --> 18:08.556
That I was. It's a bloody shame
what happened.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.540
I'm sorry for your loss.

18:10.572 --> 18:14.155
He always did right by you,
didn't he?

18:14.188 --> 18:16.875
Why don't you come to the point,
Mrs. Haverstock?

18:16.907 --> 18:21.868
I hate to come here like this.

18:21.899 --> 18:24.619
I didn't know
where else to turn.

18:24.651 --> 18:26.988
I need money.

18:27.020 --> 18:29.835
A small loan.

18:29.868 --> 18:32.556
I see.

18:32.588 --> 18:35.628
I can't help you.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.324
But...

18:37.356 --> 18:39.051
The Squire will evict us
if we don't pay.

18:39.083 --> 18:40.139
Times are tough.

18:40.172 --> 18:41.388
What must I do? Beg?

18:41.420 --> 18:45.195
Begging won't make
any difference.

18:45.228 --> 18:48.426
It's the sickness.
People are scared.

18:48.459 --> 18:50.379
They're seeing the devil
under their beds

18:50.411 --> 18:51.820
or hiding in the woodshed.

18:51.852 --> 18:54.668
He arrested Molly Pryor
just two days ago for witchery.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.548
Molly Pryor?
She's just a harmless old woman.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.946
She confessed to all charges.

18:59.979 --> 19:02.475
I'll give you some advice
because Joseph was my friend

19:02.508 --> 19:05.292
and he didn't deserve
to go the way I did.

19:05.324 --> 19:09.164
Leave town while you can.

19:19.692 --> 19:24.299
That day when Joseph
came into town, what happened?

19:24.332 --> 19:26.027
He delivered the grain,

19:26.059 --> 19:29.260
then came in for a drink,
as usual.

19:29.292 --> 19:30.988
But there was a man here
from outside the village

19:31.019 --> 19:33.932
with the sickness.

19:33.964 --> 19:37.772
Joseph drank from the wrong cup.

19:37.804 --> 19:40.875
An honest mistake.

19:40.908 --> 19:44.171
And from that moment,
he was done for.

19:44.202 --> 19:46.122
You saw this?

19:46.476 --> 19:48.139
I heard it.

19:48.172 --> 19:50.156
From who?

19:51.851 --> 19:54.219
Well, the Squire, of course.

20:10.444 --> 20:13.515
Come on.

21:40.683 --> 21:42.891
Do as you must, love.

22:04.075 --> 22:06.603
Grace.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.419
Good morning, Mrs. Haverstock.

23:05.451 --> 23:06.987
Suppose you've come
for your money.

23:07.019 --> 23:09.963
All in good time.
Mind if I come in?

23:10.603 --> 23:15.692
Never fails to impress me how
so many can live on so little.

23:15.723 --> 23:16.908
How are you holding up?

23:16.939 --> 23:18.828
I can only imagine
how difficult it is

23:18.859 --> 23:21.035
with all you've been through.

23:22.699 --> 23:24.907
We're getting by.

23:24.940 --> 23:27.916
Could I trouble you
for a libation?

23:27.947 --> 23:29.803
We only have ale.

23:29.836 --> 23:32.235
A cool ale would hit the spot.

23:34.251 --> 23:36.587
Poor child.

23:36.620 --> 23:39.979
Won't be easy for her
growing up without a father.

23:40.011 --> 23:41.739
Having suffered
the loss of my own mother

23:41.772 --> 23:44.523
as a child, I do believe
it deprived my character

23:44.556 --> 23:48.203
of the more tender sentiments.

23:48.236 --> 23:49.996
I'm sorry.

23:50.027 --> 23:51.212
About your mother, I mean.

23:51.243 --> 23:53.259
Oh, don't be.
She was a whore.

23:53.292 --> 23:55.179
My father beat her to death
with an iron skillet

23:55.212 --> 24:00.043
when he caught her looking
at another man.

24:00.075 --> 24:01.836
Cheers.

24:01.868 --> 24:06.603
Eviction is such thirsty work.

24:06.636 --> 24:11.243
Then this should keep
you imbibed for a while.

24:11.276 --> 24:14.827
For three months at least.

24:14.860 --> 24:17.259
I'm impressed.

24:17.292 --> 24:19.787
What about the next month
and the month after?

24:19.820 --> 24:21.580
Surely you don't expect me to
believe that you're going to

24:21.611 --> 24:22.956
work this land whilst
tending to an infant...

24:22.988 --> 24:25.099
- We'll manage.
- And you'll fail.

24:25.131 --> 24:29.739
All you will have achieved
is to delay the inevitable.

24:45.099 --> 24:47.115
Another three months.

24:51.019 --> 24:52.971
Satisfied?

24:55.436 --> 24:57.708
Doesn't have to be this way.

24:57.739 --> 24:59.307
An arrangement could be reached.

24:59.339 --> 25:01.227
You could cover your rent by...

25:01.259 --> 25:04.428
other means.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.252
Other means?

25:06.283 --> 25:09.099
Well, let's not mince words.

25:09.132 --> 25:12.108
You have your money.
Now please leave.

25:20.331 --> 25:21.612
You should count

25:21.643 --> 25:23.339
yourself bloody lucky.

25:23.372 --> 25:25.900
You think I make an offer
like this to just anyone.

25:25.931 --> 25:28.043
Get off or me!

25:28.076 --> 25:31.052
Get your hands off of me!

25:31.916 --> 25:35.083
I saw how you were with Joseph,
flaunting your tender body

25:35.115 --> 25:37.611
like bait on a fishhook,
reeling him in

25:37.643 --> 25:38.859
with the promise
of succulent quim.

25:38.892 --> 25:41.451
Please stop this!

25:41.483 --> 25:44.236
You can feel me, can't you?

25:44.267 --> 25:46.635
-Get off of me!

25:46.668 --> 25:48.619
Get out!

25:49.323 --> 25:51.531
You're hardly in a position
to be choosy,

25:51.564 --> 25:53.931
not after your husband's
misfortune.

25:53.963 --> 25:55.339
Get out.

25:55.371 --> 25:56.972
Make me.

26:00.204 --> 26:03.019
You got some fight in you.
I like that.

26:05.420 --> 26:07.211
That's more like it.

26:07.243 --> 26:09.579
On your knees. Relax.

26:09.612 --> 26:12.267
You might even enjoy it.

26:21.643 --> 26:23.052
Aaah!

26:27.019 --> 26:30.763
Now get the hell
out of my house!

26:30.795 --> 26:34.060
- Come here, you little shit!
- Aaah!

26:41.067 --> 26:42.923
You'll pay for this, harlot.

26:42.956 --> 26:44.747
Ha!

26:44.780 --> 26:46.540
-Come on.

27:01.676 --> 27:05.355
They murdered her.

27:05.388 --> 27:07.723
What re you talking about?

27:07.755 --> 27:10.540
I never told you
about my mother.

27:10.571 --> 27:12.043
I was very young.

27:12.075 --> 27:15.883
It was early on the Sabbath
when they came for.

27:15.915 --> 27:17.516
My father tried to stop them,

27:17.547 --> 27:20.619
but he was helpless
to prevent it.

27:20.652 --> 27:23.051
A few days later we were
summoned to Blackthorne Castle

27:23.083 --> 27:25.196
to hear the verdict.

27:26.156 --> 27:28.171
The whole village came out.

27:28.203 --> 27:30.252
They were too afraid not to.

27:30.827 --> 27:35.883
For fear of Judge Moorcroft,
the witch finder.

27:37.547 --> 27:40.651
Would you let your shame fall on
your daughter's shoulders?

27:40.683 --> 27:42.251
Don't you dare hurt her!

27:42.283 --> 27:46.283
Then confess, or you condemn
her as you condemn yourself.

27:46.316 --> 27:48.075
All right, I confess.

27:48.107 --> 27:49.323
I didn't hear you.

27:49.356 --> 27:52.076
I confess, damn you!

27:52.107 --> 27:53.900
Moorcroft declared
my mother a witch

27:53.931 --> 27:55.883
and sentenced her to death.

27:55.916 --> 27:57.099
Burn her.

27:57.132 --> 28:00.843
I didn't understand
what was happening.

28:00.876 --> 28:02.859
All I knew is that they were
taking away my mother.

28:02.892 --> 28:06.539
I'm sorry, Grace.
I wasn't strong enough.

28:06.571 --> 28:08.619
Don't be afraid.

28:08.652 --> 28:11.339
Promise me, always stay
true to yourself.

28:11.371 --> 28:13.259
Let no one tell you
who you are.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.947
Take her away.

28:15.980 --> 28:18.252
And I had to watch.

28:18.283 --> 28:19.372
Please!

28:20.876 --> 28:23.115
As they burned her alive.

28:29.676 --> 28:32.523
I should have told you.

28:32.556 --> 28:34.411
You deserve to know who I am.

28:34.443 --> 28:37.291
I know who you are.

28:37.323 --> 28:39.307
And I love you.

28:42.891 --> 28:47.467
This, us...

28:47.499 --> 28:49.387
it's all that matters.

28:49.419 --> 28:52.651
You and the baby are
the most precious thing to me.

28:52.683 --> 28:55.531
I'll do anything
to keep you safe.

28:56.491 --> 28:58.603
I know.

28:59.339 --> 29:02.923
Your mother...

29:02.955 --> 29:04.267
she was innocent.

29:04.299 --> 29:08.268
It doesn't matter.
Innocent or not, she confessed.

29:10.923 --> 29:12.876
That makes her a witch.

29:15.371 --> 29:20.139
Ale. Make it quick.

29:20.619 --> 29:22.443
Rough day, Squire?

29:22.476 --> 29:25.067
Keep your insolent tongue
inside your wretched head.

29:25.100 --> 29:26.508
Just asking, Squire.

29:26.540 --> 29:29.963
It was that damn Haverstock
woman, if you must know.

29:29.995 --> 29:31.179
I only went round
to collect the rent.

29:31.212 --> 29:32.747
She flew into a rage
and attacked me.

29:32.780 --> 29:34.059
The woman's a menace.

29:34.092 --> 29:36.012
You mean she doesn't fancy you?

29:36.044 --> 29:37.836
It's written all over
your face, Squire.

29:37.867 --> 29:39.852
One more word.

29:39.884 --> 29:41.900
Your rent's coming up soon,
isn't it?

29:41.932 --> 29:44.812
I'd hate to have to it raise it.
That goes for all of you!

29:44.844 --> 29:46.251
I own you!

29:46.283 --> 29:48.171
Remember that!

29:48.203 --> 29:52.428
What I mean is, does anyone
know what really happened

29:52.460 --> 29:53.196
to Joseph?

29:53.227 --> 29:54.923
She claims the sickness
took him.

29:54.955 --> 29:56.780
But what about her
and her baby, too?

29:56.811 --> 29:58.827
I tell you.

29:58.859 --> 30:02.060
There's something wicked
at work in that place.

30:05.420 --> 30:07.659
I saw her in town the other day.

30:07.692 --> 30:09.579
Acting bloody peculiar, she was.

30:09.612 --> 30:13.003
She and Molly Pryor were
close friends, I heard tell.

30:13.035 --> 30:16.875
Joseph was showing me
interest until she came along.

30:16.907 --> 30:18.412
She must have beguiled him.

30:18.444 --> 30:20.843
There's only one thing
that can explain it.

30:20.875 --> 30:22.731
She made a pact with the devil.

30:22.763 --> 30:24.907
Grace Haverstock's a witch.

30:24.939 --> 30:28.523
She came here looking for money.
I sent her away.

30:28.555 --> 30:30.411
Then I reckon
you're fucked, mate.

30:30.443 --> 30:32.459
She and Molly were in league.

30:32.491 --> 30:34.443
Killing one witch didn't
rid us of the sickness.

30:34.476 --> 30:37.227
Then we burn her, too.

30:37.259 --> 30:40.492
Did somebody say witch?

30:50.443 --> 30:53.547
Shh, shh, shh.

30:59.211 --> 31:01.899
Shh, shh, shh.

31:49.035 --> 31:51.372
Sleep soundly, my little one.

33:04.172 --> 33:06.604
Got to prime it first,
or don't work so good.

33:07.787 --> 33:08.972
Who are you?
What do you want?

33:09.004 --> 33:11.020
We want you, witch.

33:14.091 --> 33:15.563
Aaah!

33:15.595 --> 33:18.251
Witch!

33:18.572 --> 33:20.331
She's a feisty one, isn't she?

33:20.363 --> 33:22.379
Nowhere to run, witch.

33:59.276 --> 34:00.908
Yeah, look.

34:00.940 --> 34:03.659
She bleeds like the rest of us.

34:03.692 --> 34:05.322
Let's go.

34:10.572 --> 34:13.515
No sense taking any chances.

34:27.788 --> 34:29.964
Now, that's how you
deal with witches.

34:35.276 --> 34:38.219
No! What have you done?

34:38.252 --> 34:39.468
You were supposed
to bring her in,

34:39.500 --> 34:41.324
not but the house
to the ground.

34:41.355 --> 34:43.148
She was going to burn anyway,
so what's the difference?

34:43.180 --> 34:46.571
It's my property, you moron.

34:52.427 --> 34:55.692
Morton, how could you?
What are you doing?

34:55.724 --> 34:57.516
Alright, well, she's dead now.

34:57.548 --> 34:58.764
So naught can be done about it.

34:58.796 --> 35:00.524
She's not bloody dead,
you useless fools!

35:00.555 --> 35:02.475
She escaped down the back.

35:02.508 --> 35:04.011
I should have known
it wouldn't be so easy

35:04.043 --> 35:05.706
to rid ourselves of you.

35:05.739 --> 35:08.747
Grace Haverstock, you stand
accused of the crimes

35:08.779 --> 35:12.555
of witchcraft and making
unholy covenant with the devil.

35:12.587 --> 35:13.964
What say you to these charges?

35:13.995 --> 35:15.659
Bring me the child.

35:15.692 --> 35:19.660
No! No! No! Not my baby!

35:20.780 --> 35:22.635
Grace!

35:23.532 --> 35:25.995
- Quit your struggling.
- No!

35:29.132 --> 35:32.268
- So innocent.
- No! My baby!

35:32.300 --> 35:35.211
Won't harm a hair on her head.

35:49.580 --> 35:52.076
Abby!

36:22.828 --> 36:25.932
What's this then? Another witch?

36:58.635 --> 37:00.332
- Got another witch for you.
- Ah.

37:00.364 --> 37:01.419
I'm no witch.

37:01.452 --> 37:02.955
That's what they
all say, darling.

37:02.987 --> 37:06.028
Not often we get one
as fine as you down here.

37:06.059 --> 37:07.756
Hey! Come on.

37:07.787 --> 37:10.028
You! You can see it, can't you?

37:10.059 --> 37:13.386
The seeds of our destruction
have already taken root.

37:13.419 --> 37:14.636
Shut it, you!

37:14.668 --> 37:16.427
Come on, don't make this
any bloody harder.

37:16.460 --> 37:18.380
Come on.
Don't keep on struggling.

37:18.412 --> 37:22.122
Right.
Here, give me that.

37:22.156 --> 37:24.906
Yes, and enemy who sowed them
is the devil.

37:24.939 --> 37:26.987
For the harvest is
the close of the age.

37:30.123 --> 37:32.076
Welcome to Paradise.

37:36.939 --> 37:38.892
I want to see my baby.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.875
I want to see my daughter.

37:41.804 --> 37:43.692
Damn you!

37:51.020 --> 37:53.196
How could you?

37:53.228 --> 37:55.083
She's your friend.

37:55.116 --> 37:57.036
She's your friend.

37:57.068 --> 37:58.539
At least she was.

37:58.571 --> 37:59.883
What do you mean by that?

37:59.916 --> 38:01.419
You'll have nothing more
to do with her.

38:01.451 --> 38:02.636
Do you understand?

38:02.668 --> 38:04.331
The Squire would take away
everything we had

38:04.363 --> 38:06.186
if he knew we were associated
with that witch.

38:06.219 --> 38:08.300
But Grace is not a witch!

38:08.332 --> 38:10.316
Enough!

38:12.939 --> 38:13.996
I'll hear no more of it.

38:14.027 --> 38:18.379
Or do you want to be chained
up alongside your friend?

38:19.787 --> 38:21.899
All it takes is a word.

39:33.803 --> 39:36.139
Mama?

39:53.803 --> 39:55.212
- Wait.
- I can't stay.

39:55.243 --> 39:57.003
A moment, that's all I ask.

39:57.036 --> 39:59.500
I'm forbidden to speak to you.

40:21.611 --> 40:24.139
Psst.

40:24.171 --> 40:26.699
Are you okay?

40:26.732 --> 40:28.939
It's okay. They've gone now.

40:29.579 --> 40:31.371
What's your name?

40:31.403 --> 40:33.196
Astrid.

40:33.227 --> 40:35.020
Where's your family, Astrid?

40:35.051 --> 40:36.940
They're all gone.

40:36.971 --> 40:39.916
The sickness took them.

40:39.947 --> 40:42.188
I'm so sorry.

40:47.500 --> 40:50.476
You don't look much
like a thief.

40:50.507 --> 40:52.939
What'd you do to end up in here?

40:52.971 --> 40:54.572
Nothing.

40:54.603 --> 40:56.236
That's what I told them.

40:56.267 --> 40:58.699
But they beat me.

40:58.731 --> 41:01.515
And kept on beating me
till I confessed

41:01.548 --> 41:04.332
to stealing a chicken
and a loaf of bread.

41:05.419 --> 41:09.228
But I was starving.
I had no choice.

41:11.691 --> 41:13.899
Soul of Christ, sanctify me.

41:13.932 --> 41:16.300
Blood of Christ, wash me.

41:16.331 --> 41:17.868
Body of Christ save me!

41:17.899 --> 41:20.203
Blood of Christ, inebriate me.

41:20.236 --> 41:21.387
And him?

41:21.419 --> 41:24.940
Reverend Malcolm,
he's out of his mind.

41:24.971 --> 41:26.508
He talks to himself
day and night.

41:26.539 --> 41:29.996
He thinks that the sickness
is the devil's work,

41:30.027 --> 41:34.188
that the end of times is here.

41:34.219 --> 41:38.347
You must be strong tomorrow.

41:38.380 --> 41:40.652
What's to happen to me?

41:40.683 --> 41:43.436
They'll try to break you.

41:43.467 --> 41:46.412
Like they did to poor old Molly.

41:46.443 --> 41:48.875
And the rest of us.

41:50.156 --> 41:54.796
Sooner or later,
he breaks everyone.

41:54.827 --> 41:58.892
You mustn't let him.

42:02.571 --> 42:04.652
Behold, thou witch!

42:04.683 --> 42:07.180
- There she is!
- Witch!

42:07.211 --> 42:08.331
- Witch!
- Witch!

42:08.363 --> 42:10.347
- Witch!
- Witch!

42:10.379 --> 42:12.075
- Witch!
- Get away!

42:12.107 --> 42:13.387
I'll break your bloody skull!

42:13.419 --> 42:15.915
- Witch!
- That's for Joseph, witch!

42:40.139 --> 42:42.700
Witch! Witch!

42:49.420 --> 42:54.539
Woman, cry no, we won't.

42:55.467 --> 42:59.467
Woman, cry no, we won't.

43:01.900 --> 43:04.459
Cry no, we won't.

43:04.491 --> 43:05.835
Aaah!

43:10.540 --> 43:13.451
Give it to her! Yes!

43:13.483 --> 43:15.723
Hurt her!

43:38.859 --> 43:42.219
Your friend Molly Pryor here
only managed two days

43:42.251 --> 43:44.619
before she spilled her guts.

43:44.652 --> 43:47.436
Doesn't have to be this way.

43:47.467 --> 43:50.347
I could still help you,
if you'd let me.

43:50.379 --> 43:53.036
Did you help Molly, too?

43:54.187 --> 43:55.787
Or was she not your type?

43:55.820 --> 43:58.603
I suspected I was going to
have trouble with you,

43:58.635 --> 44:00.779
so I've sent for help
from some more skilled

44:00.811 --> 44:02.571
in the art of persuasion,

44:02.603 --> 44:07.147
the witch finder John Moorcroft.

44:07.179 --> 44:11.147
So why not spare yourself
the pain, confess.

44:11.180 --> 44:14.187
Your conscience will be clear.

44:14.219 --> 44:17.196
My conscience is already clear.

44:17.227 --> 44:19.179
Where is my daughter?
What have you done with her?

44:19.212 --> 44:21.611
I haven't done anything
with her.

44:21.643 --> 44:23.660
You think I'd harm
an innocent child?

44:23.691 --> 44:24.972
What kind of man
do you take me for?

44:25.003 --> 44:28.267
I take you for a fool
and a coward.

44:28.299 --> 44:30.763
You have an insolent
tongue, witch.

44:30.795 --> 44:32.683
You're lucky that
I'm feeling charitable today.

44:32.715 --> 44:35.371
Otherwise, I take great pleasure
in cutting it out.

44:35.403 --> 44:39.468
But I warn you,
judgment is coming.

44:39.500 --> 44:42.699
And he won't be so forgiving.

44:42.731 --> 44:45.643
Let him come.

45:18.475 --> 45:21.067
- God bless all here.
- Welcome, sir.

45:21.099 --> 45:23.436
Care for a drink?

45:23.467 --> 45:26.316
My companion and I have been
on the road since dawn

45:26.347 --> 45:28.396
We require food, libation.

45:28.428 --> 45:30.283
Take a seat.
I'll have the food sent over.

45:30.316 --> 45:32.619
Thank you.

45:32.651 --> 45:36.587
Moorcroft, is it?

45:36.620 --> 45:39.307
- Aye.
- That's him, all right.

45:39.339 --> 45:41.707
George Moorcroft.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.147
Butcher and bastard.

45:43.179 --> 45:46.700
Hey, Watkins, you're drunk.
Leave the man be.

45:46.732 --> 45:50.187
You have me
at a disadvantage, sir.

45:50.219 --> 45:52.524
You appear to know me,
but I must confess,

45:52.556 --> 45:55.179
I'm at a total loss.

45:55.211 --> 45:58.507
No, I don't suppose
you do remember me.

45:58.539 --> 46:01.675
Just another grieving husband
amongst the countless

46:01.707 --> 46:03.371
that you've left behind.

46:03.403 --> 46:06.443
Sir, your wife was a witch then?

46:06.475 --> 46:09.067
My wife was no witch.

46:09.099 --> 46:10.347
Mistakes are made.

46:10.379 --> 46:12.235
Mistake? Is that what it was?

46:12.267 --> 46:13.291
If that helps.

46:13.323 --> 46:15.819
The only thing that'll help me

46:15.851 --> 46:16.907
is seeing you dead.

46:16.939 --> 46:18.316
Watkins, don't!

46:18.348 --> 46:20.587
There's no need for bloodshed.

46:23.180 --> 46:25.387
What in the name of God
happened to you?

46:25.419 --> 46:27.819
The judge showed me
the path to truth.

46:27.852 --> 46:30.764
Open your heart,
and he will show you, too.

46:30.796 --> 46:33.579
Get the hell out of my way.

46:33.612 --> 46:35.115
Aah!

46:46.092 --> 46:49.675
For some, the truth
is beyond them.

46:51.339 --> 46:53.515
Come, Ursula.

46:53.547 --> 46:56.556
I fear we've outstayed
our welcome.

47:06.380 --> 47:09.003
You can be as selfless
as you like.

47:09.036 --> 47:11.755
You can't win.

47:11.787 --> 47:13.771
We're innocent.

47:13.803 --> 47:16.331
I don't care.

47:27.019 --> 47:28.747
That man's got the sickness.

47:28.779 --> 47:30.348
Is that right?

47:30.380 --> 47:33.995
You're not just a pretty face,
are you then?

47:34.028 --> 47:36.427
Come on, then.

47:36.459 --> 47:38.699
Whew.

47:41.355 --> 47:44.620
The sickness, eh?

47:44.652 --> 47:47.628
All the more reason to
keep him locked up.

48:07.531 --> 48:10.508
Fresh water straight
from the river.

48:10.540 --> 48:12.043
For all it's worth.

48:12.075 --> 48:14.155
I thought you were forbidden
to speak to me.

48:14.187 --> 48:18.252
Well, they'll punish me I do.
You'll curse me if I don't.

48:19.915 --> 48:22.060
You know why I'm really here.

48:23.244 --> 48:25.419
All I ask is news
of my daughter.

48:25.451 --> 48:26.699
I don't know anything.

48:26.731 --> 48:29.515
Ask around. Anything
you can find out, please.

48:29.547 --> 48:31.692
Sorry, I have to go.

48:46.188 --> 48:50.796
And I looked,
beheld a pale horse.

48:54.379 --> 48:59.019
His name who sat
on him was Death.

49:00.235 --> 49:02.187
Hell followed with him.

49:02.987 --> 49:07.084
Judge Moorcroft, thank you
for your swift response.

49:07.116 --> 49:09.899
We're in need of your expertise
in this matter.

49:09.932 --> 49:11.531
Has my equipment arrived?

49:11.562 --> 49:13.579
It got here just before you did.

49:13.611 --> 49:15.595
- Good. Take me to her.
- So soon?

49:15.627 --> 49:19.307
After such a long journey,
would you not prefer to rest?

49:19.339 --> 49:22.155
The devil never rests.

49:22.187 --> 49:24.171
Nor must we.

49:24.203 --> 49:25.452
She has a bed in her cell?

49:25.484 --> 49:27.915
Yes, it's crude,
but it's enough to sleep on.

49:27.947 --> 49:30.667
We must get rid of it.
You're too lenient.

49:30.699 --> 49:34.124
And if she sleeps,
you douse her with ice water.

49:34.156 --> 49:36.812
She's in league with
the dark one.

49:36.844 --> 49:38.956
Never forget that.

49:40.844 --> 49:45.484
Fear not, my child.
Salvation is at hand.

49:47.275 --> 49:49.292
Have food and wine sent to
my room.

49:49.324 --> 49:51.179
I must prepare.

49:51.212 --> 49:54.699
There is God's work to be done.

50:18.859 --> 50:20.779
Joseph.

50:20.811 --> 50:23.020
Grace.

50:24.459 --> 50:25.964
Grace.

50:27.692 --> 50:29.259
Joseph.

50:29.900 --> 50:31.564
Joseph?

51:08.939 --> 51:10.602
No!

51:16.556 --> 51:18.604
She won't last long.

51:18.636 --> 51:20.267
I don't know.

51:20.299 --> 51:23.308
There's something about her,
something different.

51:23.339 --> 51:25.644
- Different?
- Yeah.

51:25.676 --> 51:29.963
Well, witch or not,
I'd still do her.

51:31.691 --> 51:33.803
You're a sick bastard, Peck.

51:33.836 --> 51:37.643
She'll curse you,
make your balls drop off.

51:37.676 --> 51:39.852
I'd still do her.

51:52.012 --> 51:55.883
Never forget who you are.

51:55.916 --> 51:58.571
Wake up, witch!

52:03.402 --> 52:05.322
It's time.

52:06.860 --> 52:10.572
Grace Haverstock,
I am confused.

52:10.604 --> 52:13.962
The depositions are unanimous,
and the evidence is clear.

52:13.995 --> 52:17.164
Yet you persist
in claiming your innocence.

52:17.196 --> 52:18.923
Now, you must understand
that you have put me

52:18.956 --> 52:21.996
in a very difficult position.

52:22.028 --> 52:25.643
But when dealing
with the forces of darkness,

52:25.676 --> 52:29.676
I cannot afford to be reckless.

52:29.708 --> 52:35.660
The devil, Grace, is deceitful,

52:35.691 --> 52:40.076
and it is my sworn duty
to uncover the truth.

52:42.380 --> 52:44.586
Oh.

52:44.619 --> 52:46.924
You won't be
needing this anymore.

52:49.804 --> 52:54.508
For this is between
you and I now, Grace.

52:55.275 --> 52:59.243
It's a battle of wills,
if you like,

52:59.276 --> 53:02.284
and I warn you of this.

53:02.316 --> 53:05.484
My will is greater than yours.

53:05.515 --> 53:07.916
We'll see.

53:10.602 --> 53:13.419
Well, let us begin.

53:13.451 --> 53:15.371
Gentlemen.

53:22.156 --> 53:24.363
Strap her in.

53:37.899 --> 53:42.186
Sister Agatha, you may proceed
with the examination.

54:23.883 --> 54:26.699
We have something.

54:32.523 --> 54:34.252
And there we have it!

54:34.283 --> 54:37.323
Clear as day!
The devil's mark.

54:38.475 --> 54:41.259
Tell me something, my dear.

54:41.292 --> 54:43.723
When you fornicate
with the beast,

54:43.756 --> 54:46.188
does his bite sting?

54:47.563 --> 54:48.364
Come on!

54:48.395 --> 54:49.868
No, I don't want to go
back in there.

54:49.899 --> 54:52.908
You will go where you are
bloody well told.

54:54.732 --> 54:57.739
And cover yourself up.

55:02.539 --> 55:06.188
I brought you extra bread
and cheese.

55:06.219 --> 55:09.099
- Do you duties, boy!
- I've got to go.

55:09.132 --> 55:11.052
Just don't give up.

55:11.084 --> 55:13.836
The judge is begging
for his wine.

55:13.868 --> 55:17.772
- What news from London?
- Oh, London is lost.

55:17.804 --> 55:23.083
Thousands have fled to
the safety of the countryside.

55:23.116 --> 55:25.644
Bodies are piled high
in the narrow streets.

55:25.675 --> 55:30.092
Burial parties struggle to cope,
so the stench of rotting flesh

55:30.123 --> 55:33.963
hangs over the city
like putrid fog.

55:33.996 --> 55:35.692
And the rats...

55:38.699 --> 55:41.964
The rats are everywhere.

55:41.995 --> 55:46.156
It's as if the day of judgment
has finally arrived.

55:46.187 --> 55:48.459
All the more reason we should
seek out and destroy evil

55:48.492 --> 55:50.156
where we find it,
don't you think?

55:50.187 --> 55:51.468
Easier said than done.

55:51.499 --> 55:55.179
Grace may be stubborn,
but she will break.

55:55.212 --> 56:00.108
You'd be surprised.
Such is the power of conviction.

56:00.139 --> 56:03.467
Well, maybe you're
just not hurting her enough,

56:03.500 --> 56:05.739
You really are a vicious brute,
aren't you?

56:05.772 --> 56:08.300
Coming from you, I'll take
that as a compliment.

56:08.332 --> 56:11.499
I just hope we didn't
bring you here for nothing.

56:11.532 --> 56:13.452
She has the devil inside her.

56:13.483 --> 56:16.876
Any fool can see that.

56:16.907 --> 56:19.723
You will have your confession.
I guarantee it.

56:51.084 --> 56:53.708
Joseph.

56:58.123 --> 57:01.292
There, my love.

57:01.323 --> 57:03.339
I'm with you.

57:03.372 --> 57:05.996
Oh, I want to see you.

57:06.027 --> 57:07.820
Open your eyes.

57:35.756 --> 57:37.836
Oh.

57:39.596 --> 57:42.347
A sign of despair.

57:46.603 --> 57:49.931
I care not for your flesh.

57:49.963 --> 57:52.459
I just want your soul.

57:57.259 --> 58:01.932
What did I tell you?
No sleeping!

58:08.779 --> 58:10.987
They usually give up by now.

58:11.020 --> 58:13.259
Hm.

58:22.603 --> 58:24.812
You playing, or what?

58:24.843 --> 58:27.787
What if she's innocent
like she says?

58:27.819 --> 58:31.275
Does she go to Hell?
Or do we?

58:31.307 --> 58:34.091
Look around you, mate.

58:34.123 --> 58:36.140
We're already here.

58:36.171 --> 58:38.923
Roll.

58:39.147 --> 58:41.292
Shit!

58:41.323 --> 58:43.691
What's with all these bloody
rats all of a sudden?

58:43.723 --> 58:46.188
Have you seen any cats lately?

58:46.219 --> 58:48.108
Roll.

59:03.116 --> 59:05.835
Grace, Grace!

59:05.867 --> 59:08.331
I have news.

59:08.364 --> 59:09.291
Tell me, please.

59:09.324 --> 59:11.467
Your daughter is in
the keeping of the Squire

59:11.500 --> 59:12.460
in the South Tower.

59:12.491 --> 59:14.603
A nurse maid is called
to attend to her needs.

59:14.636 --> 59:16.300
- She's safe.
- She's not safe.

59:16.331 --> 59:17.611
Not with him.

59:17.643 --> 59:19.627
That's all I know.

59:19.659 --> 59:22.955
- Thank you.
- Make sure you eat.

59:38.796 --> 59:40.908
I feel it is time
that we discussed the recent

59:40.939 --> 59:43.659
passing of your husband, Joseph.

59:43.692 --> 59:49.356
I hear from the Squire that
he succumbed to the sickness.

59:49.387 --> 59:51.339
And given the circumstance,
I felt the need

59:51.372 --> 59:54.987
for absolute certainty.

59:55.019 --> 59:58.059
And so I had his body exhumed.

59:58.092 --> 59:59.467
And although his death

59:59.499 --> 1:00:02.411
by pestilence
was a foregone conclusion,

1:00:02.443 --> 1:00:07.243
you could only imagine
how perplexed I was to find...

1:00:09.451 --> 1:00:10.667
...this...

1:00:11.563 --> 1:00:15.179
...hanging around his
stretched neck.

1:00:15.211 --> 1:00:18.699
Now, I did not know
your husband, Grace,

1:00:18.731 --> 1:00:21.099
but by all accounts,
I hear that he was a good man,

1:00:21.132 --> 1:00:25.515
that he was a kind man,
that he was a godly man.

1:00:26.411 --> 1:00:30.667
Which makes me wonder,
why would such a man commit

1:00:30.699 --> 1:00:33.740
the mortal crime
of taking his own life

1:00:33.772 --> 1:00:36.363
unless it was the witch
he was fool enough

1:00:36.396 --> 1:00:39.243
to marry or the devil himself?

1:00:41.995 --> 1:00:45.643
Admit it, Grace, please.

1:00:46.059 --> 1:00:49.611
Admit it, that you...
that you cursed him

1:00:49.643 --> 1:00:53.004
and you sent an innocent man
to the bowels of hell!

1:00:55.852 --> 1:00:58.059
Take her down.

1:01:05.227 --> 1:01:09.803
Repent your sins,
redeem your soul.

1:01:09.835 --> 1:01:13.003
Free yourself.

1:01:19.435 --> 1:01:21.740
Begin.

1:02:14.283 --> 1:02:16.779
Take her away.

1:02:17.035 --> 1:02:22.027
You, boy! Give me a hand.

1:02:38.540 --> 1:02:41.003
For the love of God,
why did you do this?

1:02:41.035 --> 1:02:42.827
Just give them what they want.

1:02:42.859 --> 1:02:44.332
-I won't.

1:02:44.364 --> 1:02:47.563
If you continue like this,
they're going to kill you.

1:02:47.595 --> 1:02:50.315
They're going to kill me anyway.

1:02:50.635 --> 1:02:53.772
I do not fight for my life.

1:02:55.307 --> 1:02:59.243
Please do not abandon hope.

1:03:02.380 --> 1:03:04.779
I think hope has abandoned me.

1:03:14.699 --> 1:03:18.251
There's only way
out of this now.

1:03:28.235 --> 1:03:33.100
Something troubles you, Ursula.

1:03:33.132 --> 1:03:36.012
She has courage,
don't you think?

1:03:36.044 --> 1:03:39.916
It is but a mask,
that is all.

1:03:39.948 --> 1:03:42.283
I know.

1:03:42.315 --> 1:03:45.067
Forgive me.

1:03:45.099 --> 1:03:49.420
Never doubt the virtue
of our task.

1:03:49.452 --> 1:03:52.971
Never mind how difficult
or painful it may be.

1:03:53.003 --> 1:03:56.939
Always remember what she is.

1:04:02.860 --> 1:04:06.283
The darkness an allure to it.

1:04:06.315 --> 1:04:08.523
I understand this.

1:04:09.548 --> 1:04:12.363
And that is why our struggle
is so much harder

1:04:12.396 --> 1:04:17.131
and the Lord's soldiers
must be so much stronger.

1:04:17.164 --> 1:04:20.011
I remember the day
the rain came.

1:04:22.731 --> 1:04:26.667
Deluge direct from Heaven above.

1:04:27.820 --> 1:04:32.811
And I pulled you from the ashes,
purged of evil.

1:04:34.251 --> 1:04:38.508
And in your heart, a new resolve
to enlighten those

1:04:38.540 --> 1:04:41.131
that had strayed into
the darkness.

1:04:43.819 --> 1:04:47.531
That is true courage, Ursula.

1:04:47.562 --> 1:04:49.900
That is strength.

1:04:49.932 --> 1:04:54.700
And that is why I need you
by my side.

1:04:56.235 --> 1:05:04.715
You... are my anchor
in the eternal storm.

1:05:06.795 --> 1:05:08.715
I should have held my tongue.

1:05:08.747 --> 1:05:13.932
On the contrary, I think it is
time that you spoke with her.

1:05:18.475 --> 1:05:19.820
Stay awake.

1:05:19.851 --> 1:05:24.428
For you do not know on what day
your Lord is coming.

1:05:54.411 --> 1:05:56.587
Grace.

1:05:57.291 --> 1:05:58.892
No.

1:05:59.595 --> 1:06:01.131
It's not you.

1:06:02.668 --> 1:06:04.395
Don't you know your own husband?

1:06:04.427 --> 1:06:06.668
My love.

1:06:07.532 --> 1:06:09.452
I know the devil has many faces.

1:06:09.484 --> 1:06:14.123
Oh, Grace, please.

1:06:14.155 --> 1:06:17.099
You're just a dream.

1:06:17.132 --> 1:06:20.843
But you're awake.

1:06:20.875 --> 1:06:23.148
Joseph.

1:06:23.180 --> 1:06:24.204
Joseph!

1:06:24.236 --> 1:06:26.060
I will not be denied!

1:06:54.572 --> 1:06:56.715
Mama.

1:06:56.748 --> 1:06:59.691
I'm sorry.

1:06:59.724 --> 1:07:04.108
I blamed you
and I scolded you.

1:07:04.139 --> 1:07:07.851
I didn't understand.

1:07:07.883 --> 1:07:11.691
I did not understand.

1:07:11.723 --> 1:07:13.611
Fear not, child.

1:07:13.643 --> 1:07:15.980
The Lord forgives.

1:07:18.828 --> 1:07:21.195
How did you get in here?
What do you want?

1:07:21.227 --> 1:07:23.243
I mean you no harm.

1:07:23.276 --> 1:07:25.611
Here, eat.

1:07:30.444 --> 1:07:35.723
Tell me, what does
he say to you?

1:07:35.756 --> 1:07:37.035
Who?

1:07:37.068 --> 1:07:41.548
The devil, when he comes
to you in the night.

1:07:43.275 --> 1:07:45.452
- I don't know...
- It's okay.

1:07:45.484 --> 1:07:47.276
You can tell me.

1:07:47.308 --> 1:07:50.252
I myself spoke with
him frequently.

1:07:52.108 --> 1:07:54.124
I know how it feels.

1:07:54.156 --> 1:07:56.204
Leave me alone.

1:07:56.235 --> 1:07:57.546
Get out.

1:07:57.579 --> 1:07:59.084
I, too, succumbed
to temptation,

1:07:59.115 --> 1:08:02.475
made unholy union
with the devil.

1:08:02.507 --> 1:08:07.275
But Judge Moorcroft showed me
the path to truth.

1:08:07.307 --> 1:08:09.066
You mean he tortured you.

1:08:09.099 --> 1:08:11.276
Enlightened me.

1:08:13.419 --> 1:08:17.003
I was in denial at first.

1:08:17.036 --> 1:08:20.139
But only through
the purification of pain

1:08:20.172 --> 1:08:23.595
did I cleanse my soul.

1:08:23.627 --> 1:08:26.442
You may hold out for a day.

1:08:26.475 --> 1:08:27.756
Maybe two.

1:08:27.788 --> 1:08:31.884
But in the end,
you will beg for redemption.

1:08:31.916 --> 1:08:33.740
Let me help you.

1:08:33.771 --> 1:08:37.866
We can end
this suffering together.

1:08:38.188 --> 1:08:40.268
Mama.

1:08:41.900 --> 1:08:46.506
You gave your life for me.

1:08:46.539 --> 1:08:48.587
Should I give them
what they want?

1:08:48.620 --> 1:08:51.596
You've fought long enough.

1:08:51.628 --> 1:08:55.179
You can let go now.

1:08:55.211 --> 1:08:57.644
Free yourself.

1:09:02.379 --> 1:09:07.019
- Joseph.
- Free yourself, my love.

1:09:08.331 --> 1:09:11.819
Follow the path
to truth, Grace.

1:09:11.852 --> 1:09:17.931
If you won't do it for yourself,
then do it for your daughter.

1:09:21.516 --> 1:09:26.508
Now I see the truth of it.

1:09:26.540 --> 1:09:29.420
Tell me, how many others
have you sent the scaffold

1:09:29.451 --> 1:09:30.380
or burn to death?

1:09:30.411 --> 1:09:32.204
Did you convince them
that they were witches

1:09:32.235 --> 1:09:34.667
just as your own accusers
convinced you?

1:09:34.700 --> 1:09:40.875
When you're told something often
enough, you start to believe it.

1:09:40.908 --> 1:09:45.804
What you're unwilling
or unable to accept

1:09:45.835 --> 1:09:49.996
is you were no more the witch
then than I am now.

1:09:50.027 --> 1:09:53.900
So why don't we take your
so-called truth and get out?

1:09:53.932 --> 1:09:56.331
Guard.

1:10:01.708 --> 1:10:03.980
You should heed my words.

1:10:04.011 --> 1:10:06.636
The fate of your soul
depends upon it.

1:10:06.668 --> 1:10:09.292
Fate of my soul is a matter
between myself and God

1:10:09.323 --> 1:10:11.019
and no other.

1:10:33.612 --> 1:10:36.363
Make sure you eat.

1:10:49.932 --> 1:10:52.460
"Abby's safe. Have her.

1:10:52.492 --> 1:10:55.211
Get down here, you bloody...

1:10:55.243 --> 1:10:57.579
- Come on you!
- It's the gypsy girl.

1:10:57.612 --> 1:10:59.116
Wonder what she did.

1:10:59.147 --> 1:11:02.027
Doesn't matter.

1:11:02.060 --> 1:11:05.163
Nobody's safe.

1:11:05.196 --> 1:11:08.620
Grant me strength on this day,
oh, Lord.

1:11:08.651 --> 1:11:11.596
Shield me in your might.

1:11:14.636 --> 1:11:18.220
Dress me in your armor.

1:11:19.659 --> 1:11:24.907
That I made deflect
the evil schemes of the devil.

1:11:30.252 --> 1:11:33.676
And what torturous delights
have we in store today?

1:11:33.707 --> 1:11:36.139
I am God's instrument, sir.

1:11:36.171 --> 1:11:39.340
This is my duty.
I take no pleasure in it.

1:11:40.044 --> 1:11:41.931
Your loss.

1:11:43.692 --> 1:11:45.452
Bring forth the accused!

1:11:45.483 --> 1:11:49.100
Make way! Make way!

1:11:49.132 --> 1:11:51.147
- Witch!
- Witch!

1:11:51.179 --> 1:11:53.003
- Witch! Witch!
- Witch! Witch!

1:11:55.820 --> 1:11:59.500
My God have mercy.

1:12:11.436 --> 1:12:13.579
Good people, before you
stands Grace Haverstock.

1:12:13.611 --> 1:12:15.468
Now, you all know
why she's here.

1:12:15.499 --> 1:12:18.796
The evidence is damning
and taken from your own

1:12:18.827 --> 1:12:22.123
sworn statements,
eyewitness accounts proving

1:12:22.155 --> 1:12:23.852
her association with
Molly Pryor,

1:12:23.883 --> 1:12:26.763
a convicted witch,
and worse still,

1:12:26.796 --> 1:12:32.363
wanton fornication
with a dark one, as evidenced...

1:12:32.396 --> 1:12:34.539
by the witch's mark
upon her body.

1:12:34.572 --> 1:12:37.996
Now, such lurid testimony
should be enough to condemn her,

1:12:38.027 --> 1:12:39.947
but we have also heard

1:12:39.980 --> 1:12:42.796
how the pestilence did not
take root within her body

1:12:42.827 --> 1:12:45.580
or that of her infant child.

1:12:45.611 --> 1:12:50.796
And so I ask you
what more proof is needed?

1:12:50.828 --> 1:12:52.779
Witch, witch.

1:12:52.812 --> 1:12:55.499
For Pete's sake, stop this!

1:12:55.532 --> 1:12:57.163
Tell your wife to
mind her tongue,

1:12:57.196 --> 1:12:58.379
or she'll end up there next.

1:12:58.412 --> 1:13:00.332
Just be quiet.

1:13:00.363 --> 1:13:01.548
I will not.

1:13:01.579 --> 1:13:05.099
- Then you'll come with me.
- Get her out.

1:13:09.836 --> 1:13:14.763
I ask you again,
in the eyes of God,

1:13:14.796 --> 1:13:17.643
do you confess?

1:13:22.731 --> 1:13:24.651
Ursula.

1:13:41.612 --> 1:13:46.156
Grace, do you know
what this is?

1:13:46.187 --> 1:13:50.347
Its design is simple,
but most effective.

1:13:50.379 --> 1:13:56.172
It has but one purpose...
to inflict excruciating pain.

1:13:56.203 --> 1:13:59.979
To have the desired result,
it must be inserted fully.

1:14:00.012 --> 1:14:03.787
And then the handle
must be turned thus.

1:14:03.819 --> 1:14:09.323
Again... and again.

1:14:09.356 --> 1:14:15.372
And again until the pain
is unendurable.

1:14:15.403 --> 1:14:18.987
Grace, do not make me do this.

1:14:19.019 --> 1:14:20.587
Do not make me do this.

1:14:20.620 --> 1:14:23.595
Suffer no more!

1:14:23.627 --> 1:14:25.420
Confess.

1:14:25.451 --> 1:14:27.692
Confess!

1:14:29.899 --> 1:14:35.499
You can tear my flesh
and break my bones,

1:14:35.532 --> 1:14:39.276
but I will not
bear false witness before you

1:14:39.307 --> 1:14:41.132
or anyone else.

1:14:41.163 --> 1:14:44.683
I know the truth.

1:14:44.715 --> 1:14:50.636
And I will endure all of your
torments to protect it.

1:14:50.667 --> 1:14:54.347
For my will...

1:14:54.380 --> 1:14:57.260
is greater than yours.

1:15:02.987 --> 1:15:04.491
Take her down.

1:15:17.899 --> 1:15:21.227
Courage now, my dear Ursula.

1:15:21.260 --> 1:15:23.436
It is God's work we do here.

1:15:23.467 --> 1:15:28.203
Let him be your strength.

1:15:38.763 --> 1:15:45.163
Grace, I beg of you, confess.

1:15:46.668 --> 1:15:50.539
This is your last chance.
Confess.

1:16:34.635 --> 1:16:37.548
God as my witness, I have done
everything in my power

1:16:37.580 --> 1:16:42.091
to purge your soul of evil,
but to no avail.

1:16:42.380 --> 1:16:45.740
Therefore, I sentence you
to death for the grievous crime

1:16:45.771 --> 1:16:47.019
of malfeasance.

1:16:47.052 --> 1:16:49.739
Wait, wait, wait.
You promised me a confession.

1:16:49.771 --> 1:16:51.948
A confession is implicit.

1:16:51.980 --> 1:16:53.547
Who else could withstand
such pain

1:16:53.579 --> 1:16:54.699
other than a witch?

1:16:54.732 --> 1:16:57.099
Thou shall not suffer a witch
to live.

1:16:57.131 --> 1:16:58.700
Charlatan! The pair of you!

1:16:58.732 --> 1:17:02.604
She is in league with the devil,
and she will burn for it.

1:17:02.636 --> 1:17:04.267
As will her child.

1:17:04.299 --> 1:17:06.316
- No.
- The bloodline must be severed.

1:17:06.348 --> 1:17:08.203
No! No!

1:17:08.236 --> 1:17:10.635
The sentence of
this court is final.

1:17:10.667 --> 1:17:11.947
Not my baby! No!

1:17:11.979 --> 1:17:14.028
God have mercy on your souls.

1:17:14.060 --> 1:17:16.363
No!

1:17:17.868 --> 1:17:19.692
What's the matter?
Nothing to say now?

1:17:19.723 --> 1:17:22.123
- Nothing to say to you.
- Oh, suit yourself.

1:17:22.155 --> 1:17:24.523
Better that way. Don't know
what you're so upset about.

1:17:24.556 --> 1:17:26.476
She lied to us.
She had it coming.

1:17:26.508 --> 1:17:29.835
Why did I marry such
an ignorant fool?

1:17:29.867 --> 1:17:31.276
What did you say?

1:17:31.308 --> 1:17:33.707
- You heard me.
- Say it again.

1:17:33.740 --> 1:17:35.531
Go on.

1:17:35.563 --> 1:17:37.132
Say it to my face.

1:17:37.164 --> 1:17:40.619
I won't be silenced
by a coward like you.

1:17:40.651 --> 1:17:42.187
To hell with you.

1:17:42.219 --> 1:17:45.708
If that's how you feel,
you can bloody well walk home.

1:17:49.931 --> 1:17:53.259
Is that it? Is that all you got?

1:17:53.291 --> 1:17:56.843
Didn't you learn anything
from what you saw today?

1:17:56.875 --> 1:17:59.148
I'm not taking
your shit anymore!

1:17:59.180 --> 1:18:02.347
-Oh, is that all you got, eh?

1:18:02.379 --> 1:18:04.908
It's time I taught you a lesson
you're not going to forget

1:18:04.940 --> 1:18:07.243
in such a hurry.

1:18:25.611 --> 1:18:32.652
Aaah!

1:18:32.684 --> 1:18:34.251
What are you gonna
do with that, eh?

1:18:34.283 --> 1:18:36.556
Give me a bloody tooth ache?

1:18:56.395 --> 1:19:01.995
Well, he smells pretty bad,
so it looks like it was

1:19:02.027 --> 1:19:04.300
the sickness that killed him.

1:19:04.332 --> 1:19:06.699
So the witch was right then?

1:19:09.899 --> 1:19:12.140
Yeah.

1:19:21.163 --> 1:19:22.668
I got your message.

1:19:22.700 --> 1:19:26.187
But I need more than hope now.

1:19:26.219 --> 1:19:29.260
Tell me what will they do
with old man's body?

1:19:29.292 --> 1:19:32.140
Dump it in the pit come morning,
I expect.

1:19:32.172 --> 1:19:34.220
Why?

1:19:34.252 --> 1:19:39.595
I was hoping to escape
with Abby tonight.

1:19:39.627 --> 1:19:43.307
Will you help me?

1:19:43.339 --> 1:19:45.067
Tell me what to do.

1:19:47.307 --> 1:19:54.091
Enter.

1:19:54.123 --> 1:19:55.787
The witch wants to
speak with you.

1:19:55.819 --> 1:19:59.595
She says she's got something
important to tell you.

1:19:59.627 --> 1:20:02.507
Then we better hear
what she has to say.

1:20:02.539 --> 1:20:04.555
Bring her up.

1:20:06.571 --> 1:20:09.708
Clean yourself up.
Put that on.

1:20:09.740 --> 1:20:13.163
You ought to look respectable
for the judge.

1:20:13.195 --> 1:20:15.883
We'll watch.

1:20:23.052 --> 1:20:24.972
What the bloody hell
do you think you're going

1:20:25.004 --> 1:20:26.411
to do with that thing?

1:20:26.443 --> 1:20:28.748
You can't be too careful
with the likes of her.

1:20:28.780 --> 1:20:30.251
Yeah, well, just be careful

1:20:30.283 --> 1:20:32.267
and don't blow me
to smithereens with it.

1:20:32.299 --> 1:20:36.651
Go with God, my child.
His shadow is upon you.

1:20:51.627 --> 1:20:53.740
Forgive me.

1:21:16.395 --> 1:21:18.700
Leave us.

1:21:23.051 --> 1:21:27.083
I believe there's something
you wish to tell me, Grace.

1:21:27.115 --> 1:21:29.931
I'll give you what you want.

1:21:29.963 --> 1:21:31.979
On one condition.

1:21:34.795 --> 1:21:36.555
Abby.

1:21:36.587 --> 1:21:39.788
She really is the most beautiful
child, is she not?

1:21:39.820 --> 1:21:43.147
Please give her to me.

1:21:43.179 --> 1:21:45.162
All in good time, my dear.

1:21:56.715 --> 1:21:57.932
What are you doing here, boy?

1:21:57.964 --> 1:22:00.522
Just pouring
the judge's wine, sir.

1:22:00.555 --> 1:22:02.955
Better get on with it then.

1:22:02.988 --> 1:22:06.732
So innocent, so pure.

1:22:08.780 --> 1:22:13.452
I suppose all witches start
this way before evil takes root.

1:22:13.484 --> 1:22:15.531
Being a witch yourself,

1:22:15.564 --> 1:22:19.626
how do you foresee the future
of your daughter Abigail?

1:22:19.659 --> 1:22:21.739
She dies tomorrow.

1:22:21.771 --> 1:22:24.555
At my side, by your hand.

1:22:24.587 --> 1:22:26.442
Oh.

1:22:26.475 --> 1:22:30.732
So you've come to bargain
for her life, have you?

1:22:30.764 --> 1:22:35.276
Her life is all I ask.

1:22:35.308 --> 1:22:37.835
If you still want
your confession.

1:22:39.019 --> 1:22:41.420
Very well.

1:22:42.284 --> 1:22:45.771
Your child shall live.

1:22:45.803 --> 1:22:48.491
But I have
a condition of my own.

1:22:48.522 --> 1:22:51.980
That she be raised by Ursula
as a servant of God.

1:22:53.644 --> 1:22:56.780
Her salvation demands
a strong hand.

1:22:56.811 --> 1:23:00.364
So she doesn't follow
in her mother's footsteps.

1:23:01.644 --> 1:23:06.956
Now, I feel it is time that
you should say goodbye.

1:23:10.635 --> 1:23:13.964
Never forget that I love you.

1:23:32.747 --> 1:23:35.052
It's time.

1:23:47.179 --> 1:23:52.172
I love you, Abby.
I love you!

1:23:58.188 --> 1:24:00.844
There, there, my sweet child.

1:24:00.876 --> 1:24:02.572
Mother's here.

1:24:02.603 --> 1:24:04.779
Don't cry.

1:24:19.212 --> 1:24:22.763
It's just the two
of us now, Grace.

1:24:22.796 --> 1:24:25.131
No more secrets.

1:24:25.164 --> 1:24:27.435
No more lies.

1:24:27.467 --> 1:24:29.835
Take a seat.

1:24:34.539 --> 1:24:40.299
I feel it is time that we raised
a cup to honor our deal.

1:24:49.580 --> 1:24:51.563
I must decline.

1:24:51.596 --> 1:24:53.772
I never hand the stomach for it.

1:24:53.804 --> 1:24:56.556
Well, I shan't drink alone.

1:25:01.931 --> 1:25:04.236
Very well.

1:25:04.842 --> 1:25:07.244
What difference does
it make now anyway.

1:25:09.324 --> 1:25:11.180
Good point.

1:25:14.540 --> 1:25:21.066
You know, I can feel the hatred
burning inside of you, Grace.

1:25:21.099 --> 1:25:24.363
Any reasonable person would
just let go,

1:25:24.396 --> 1:25:28.428
so why don't you let go, Grace?

1:25:32.747 --> 1:25:34.988
Maybe you'll take
courage in this.

1:25:35.019 --> 1:25:36.812
Although I fear
it may be too late for you

1:25:36.843 --> 1:25:40.266
to acquire a taste for it.

1:25:40.299 --> 1:25:42.251
To courage then.

1:25:42.283 --> 1:25:44.396
To courage.

1:25:57.132 --> 1:26:01.580
Now, what is it
you want to tell me?

1:26:01.612 --> 1:26:04.523
I must unburden myself.

1:26:04.556 --> 1:26:07.468
Then please free yourself.

1:26:07.499 --> 1:26:09.612
Judge Moorcroft...

1:26:11.212 --> 1:26:15.531
I wish to confess here and now
before the eyes of God,

1:26:15.564 --> 1:26:18.411
that I am...

1:26:18.444 --> 1:26:20.364
no witch.

1:26:25.419 --> 1:26:27.596
Aaah!

1:26:27.628 --> 1:26:28.939
What is this?

1:26:28.971 --> 1:26:32.556
A reckoning, judge.
You don't remember me, do you?

1:26:32.588 --> 1:26:34.348
And why would I remember you?

1:26:34.379 --> 1:26:36.363
I'm the daughter
of Jane Hawthorne.

1:26:36.396 --> 1:26:38.219
You burnt her alive
when I was 7 years old.

1:26:38.252 --> 1:26:40.780
You made me watch.

1:26:40.811 --> 1:26:42.860
I'm not surprised
you don't remember.

1:26:42.892 --> 1:26:47.211
Just one more innocent woman
you've murdered along the way.

1:26:47.244 --> 1:26:51.756
You know, for years, I thought
you were the devil himself.

1:26:51.788 --> 1:26:54.283
But now I see it.

1:26:54.316 --> 1:26:56.811
You're just an ordinary man.

1:27:01.163 --> 1:27:05.292
Wait a moment.
What's your hurry?

1:27:05.324 --> 1:27:08.972
I see no reason why we couldn't
become better acquainted.

1:27:09.003 --> 1:27:11.692
Acquaint yourself with this.

1:27:11.723 --> 1:27:13.868
My mistake.

1:27:13.899 --> 1:27:17.708
Not sure I could bear
to look at you anyway.

1:27:22.795 --> 1:27:27.276
If it's repentance you're after,
you will receive none.

1:27:27.308 --> 1:27:29.419
I will continue doing
what I do as long as evil

1:27:29.451 --> 1:27:33.996
stalks this earth, and yes,
yes, I do remember your mother.

1:27:34.028 --> 1:27:36.204
I remember the stench of her
as she burned.

1:27:36.235 --> 1:27:37.131
She was innocent.

1:27:37.164 --> 1:27:39.084
She gave her life to protect
her daughter.

1:27:39.115 --> 1:27:41.708
Well, we each have our part
to play, don't we?

1:27:41.739 --> 1:27:43.659
That's right.
And your part is done.

1:27:43.692 --> 1:27:45.644
Now it's time to play dead.

1:27:45.675 --> 1:27:48.332
- What?
- The wine, you fool.

1:27:48.363 --> 1:27:51.499
It's laced with pestilence.

1:27:52.940 --> 1:27:54.444
But you drunk it, too.

1:27:54.475 --> 1:27:56.843
I die tomorrow.

1:27:56.876 --> 1:27:59.787
I just wanted you to know
from the woman

1:27:59.819 --> 1:28:03.788
who killed you,
an ordinary woman.

1:28:36.363 --> 1:28:38.060
Ursula!

1:28:38.091 --> 1:28:40.332
Save your breath.

1:28:42.763 --> 1:28:45.132
It's just us now.

1:28:45.163 --> 1:28:50.699
No more secrets, no more lies.

1:28:53.387 --> 1:28:55.819
You won't be needing this.

1:29:51.820 --> 1:29:53.900
Don't make a sound.

1:29:53.931 --> 1:29:57.132
Leave now.

1:32:32.396 --> 1:32:34.572
Murdering witch!

1:32:40.075 --> 1:32:41.900
Edwin, where's Abby?

1:32:41.931 --> 1:32:43.915
I have her. Let's go.

1:32:49.547 --> 1:32:51.915
Free yourself.

1:33:02.636 --> 1:33:04.907
Grace, come on. We have to
go out through here.

1:33:04.940 --> 1:33:07.276
Wait.

1:33:22.315 --> 1:33:25.067
Guards! Sound the alarm.

1:33:36.939 --> 1:33:39.852
Grace, what's wrong?

1:33:40.395 --> 1:33:41.739
I can't go with you.

1:33:41.772 --> 1:33:45.067
What you're talking about?

1:33:45.099 --> 1:33:47.083
Wait, no!

1:33:49.676 --> 1:33:50.572
What have you done?!

1:33:50.604 --> 1:33:53.707
What needed to be done
to protect you both.

1:33:53.739 --> 1:33:54.891
I don't understand.

1:33:54.923 --> 1:33:57.003
I drunk the wine.

1:33:57.036 --> 1:34:00.011
I can't her life or yours.
I'm sorry.

1:34:00.044 --> 1:34:03.020
But the wine wasn't poisoned.

1:34:03.052 --> 1:34:04.555
What? What?

1:34:04.587 --> 1:34:06.699
I tried to tell you.

1:34:06.731 --> 1:34:08.491
Ah.

1:34:10.539 --> 1:34:13.067
What's good enough for him

1:34:13.100 --> 1:34:15.500
is good enough for me.

1:34:21.579 --> 1:34:24.012
No. No!

1:34:24.044 --> 1:34:26.060
Help me!

1:34:26.092 --> 1:34:28.651
Oy! You!

1:34:29.836 --> 1:34:32.619
What do you
think you're doing?

1:34:32.652 --> 1:34:34.251
Hey.

1:34:34.283 --> 1:34:35.564
Find Kate Tobias.

1:34:35.596 --> 1:34:38.155
Tell her what happened.
She'll know what to do.

1:34:38.187 --> 1:34:40.747
I won't leave you.

1:34:41.035 --> 1:34:43.340
You must go.

1:34:43.883 --> 1:34:47.180
You're a good man, Edwin.

1:34:55.307 --> 1:34:59.532
Ah, it's the witch.
Get her!

1:35:28.939 --> 1:35:30.699
Come on.

1:35:34.316 --> 1:35:36.012
Witch!

1:35:44.780 --> 1:35:46.987
No! Save us!

1:35:47.019 --> 1:35:48.043
Please!

1:35:48.075 --> 1:35:49.516
Keys!

1:36:11.468 --> 1:36:13.163
Get me out of here!

1:36:13.195 --> 1:36:14.508
Go.

1:36:14.540 --> 1:36:15.500
Thank you.

1:36:15.532 --> 1:36:17.067
Good luck.

1:36:17.099 --> 1:36:19.755
Please, please, hurry, hurry.

1:36:19.787 --> 1:36:21.547
Come on.

1:36:25.675 --> 1:36:28.651
Grace! Run!

1:36:28.684 --> 1:36:31.435
No. No, don't shoot.

1:36:31.467 --> 1:36:33.771
Don't.

1:36:36.235 --> 1:36:38.412
Started with your
precious husband.

1:36:38.444 --> 1:36:40.204
I'm going to kill everyone
you've ever loved

1:36:40.236 --> 1:36:43.212
or cared about until I find
your daughter.

1:37:16.491 --> 1:37:18.828
Grace, come on, let's go.

1:37:20.652 --> 1:37:24.428
Go. I'm not done yet.

1:37:39.116 --> 1:37:41.676
For the love of God.

1:37:41.708 --> 1:37:44.139
Where are your gods at now?

1:37:44.588 --> 1:37:47.404
No, I know you.

1:37:47.436 --> 1:37:49.195
You're a good woman.

1:37:52.139 --> 1:37:53.388
Have mercy.

1:37:53.420 --> 1:37:57.260
You stole all the mercy
from my heart.

1:38:00.459 --> 1:38:02.060
Damn you.

1:38:02.091 --> 1:38:03.948
You witch!

1:38:40.268 --> 1:38:45.036
May God have mercy on my soul.

1:39:07.340 --> 1:39:10.092
Oh, Joseph.

1:39:11.052 --> 1:39:13.419
I want to be with you now.

1:39:13.451 --> 1:39:16.652
Grace, you have to get up.

1:39:16.684 --> 1:39:19.403
You have to live.

1:39:19.436 --> 1:39:21.675
Abby's out there,
and she needs you now.

1:39:21.708 --> 1:39:25.452
- Abby.
- Get up, my love.

1:39:25.484 --> 1:39:28.076
Get up.

1:40:08.267 --> 1:40:10.283
Are you hurt?

1:40:10.316 --> 1:40:11.946
I'm not.

1:40:11.979 --> 1:40:14.188
Who was that?

1:40:14.219 --> 1:40:15.915
My husband.

1:40:15.947 --> 1:40:17.036
What happened?

1:40:17.068 --> 1:40:20.108
I killed him.

1:40:20.139 --> 1:40:22.988
I know I'll surely hang.
I'm not ashamed.

1:40:23.019 --> 1:40:25.580
There's been enough death
for one night.

1:40:27.467 --> 1:40:30.668
Abby!

1:40:30.699 --> 1:40:33.035
Why do you have her?
Where's Grace?

1:40:35.660 --> 1:40:37.931
Oh, Lord, no.

1:40:38.348 --> 1:40:40.907
Are you Kate Tobias?

1:40:41.132 --> 1:40:42.219
I was.

1:40:42.252 --> 1:40:44.044
Grace sent me to find you.

1:40:44.076 --> 1:40:46.220
She said you'd know what to do.

1:40:49.547 --> 1:40:52.044
I do.

1:40:52.075 --> 1:40:53.483
We have to go.

1:40:53.516 --> 1:40:55.596
Go? Go where?

1:40:58.635 --> 1:41:03.372
Far from this place.
You coming?
