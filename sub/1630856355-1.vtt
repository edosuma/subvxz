00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.666
Hey. That's a pretty nice hand, man.

00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:16.958
- [Carlitos] Dude, your cousin...
- [plane rattles]

00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:20.625
Opa! We just got bitten by the shark.

00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:22.041
[Gastón] The mountain range, huh?

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:25.083
Is it true these mountains try to suck up
anyone who passes over them?

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:27.333
Yeah. It's true.

00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:29.375
[Gastón laughs]

00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:31.583
The warm winds
from the plains of Argentina

00:10:31.666 --> 00:10:33.583
collide with the cold winds
of the mountains

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:34.875
and create a suction effect.

00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.416
Nah. You're joking. [chuckles]

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.583
[mechanic] I'm not joking.
That's why there's turbulence.

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:42.000
But, you know, we're one step ahead.

00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:43.083
Check it out.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.750
This is the mountain range.

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:52.458
{\an8}And now, we have to go from here.

00:10:52.541 --> 00:10:54.416
But the route isn't a straight line.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.666
{\an8}Look. You can't cross it just like that.
The range is massive.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:02.750
That's why we have to travel south,
looking for a lower passage through it.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.458
{\an8}We cross it, and once in Chile,
we just turn north in Curicó.

00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:10.625
And in ten minutes,
we'll be landing in Santiago.

00:11:10.708 --> 00:11:13.500
[wind gusting]

00:11:13.583 --> 00:11:14.583
[plane creaks]

00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:17.333
[pilot] Attention, passengers.
Please fasten your seat belts.

00:11:17.416 --> 00:11:21.208
- In a few minutes, we'll be in Santiago.
- Go and deal the cards, okay?

00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:23.666

00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:26.958

00:11:37.208 --> 00:11:39.375
[wind buffeting plane's wings]

00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:44.375
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain, General Carlos Páez.

00:11:44.458 --> 00:11:46.791
Everybody, please fasten your seat belts.

00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:48.915
Bodies are not allowed
to be scattered in the Andes.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.166
[guys laugh]

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.000
Please recommend Casapueblo Airlines
for the forthcoming flights!

00:11:53.083 --> 00:11:54.750
[mechanic] Sit down! Sit down!

00:11:54.833 --> 00:11:56.416
- [guys laugh]
- [mechanic] Stay there.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.916
- [man 5] Bravo!
- [chanting] Carlitos! Carlitos!

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.416
Stop. Fasten your seat belt, okay?

00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:06.291
[hushed] Go to the front.
I need some room to sit down.

00:12:06.833 --> 00:12:08.083
Come on.

00:12:08.166 --> 00:12:10.166
[excited chatter]

00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:20.625
- [turbulence jostles cabin]
- [guys cheer]

00:12:23.458 --> 00:12:25.458
[indistinct, nervous chatter]

00:12:26.125 --> 00:12:28.458
[woman 2] Sit down. I'll be right there.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:31.625
[passengers yelp]

00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:34.458

00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:36.625
[guys cheer]

00:12:36.708 --> 00:12:39.083
Hey! What's the matter? You scared?

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.125
[rattling intensifies]

00:12:45.458 --> 00:12:47.541
[woman 1] Careful, Javier. Grab my hand.

00:12:47.625 --> 00:12:50.500
[girl] Nando. Nando. Your seat belt.

00:12:50.583 --> 00:12:52.559
- No! Sit back down. Sit down.
- I gotta get there.

00:12:52.583 --> 00:12:54.041

00:12:59.666 --> 00:13:01.250

[man 6] No, no!

00:13:35.791 --> 00:13:37.791
[engines roaring]

00:13:45.416 --> 00:13:48.208
- Our Father, who art in heaven...
- I don't wanna die here!

00:13:48.291 --> 00:13:49.708
Hail Mary, full of grace...

00:13:49.791 --> 00:13:52.250

[distortion subsides]

00:15:42.166 --> 00:15:44.000

I don't want anyone else to die!
I don't want anyone else to die!

00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:12.541

Okay, that's great. Lift him up.

[breathing shakily]

00:16:14.416 --> 00:16:17.041
That's it. I need you to be calm.
Relax, relax. Now, breathe.

00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:20.458
Look into my eyes.
Look into my eyes. I study medicine.

00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:22.333
I'm Roberto. What's your name?

00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:40.500
The pilot is alive!

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:41.916
Come on, Gustavo.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.625
- On three, okay? One, two, three.
- [group grunts]

00:16:45.708 --> 00:16:46.958

Nothing's turning on. Not even the lights.

00:16:56.125 --> 00:16:58.416
I need you to tell me how the radio works.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.416
- What? What do I press?
- [splutters]

00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:03.166
[panting]

00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:07.291
Hello? We crashed in the mountains.
We're Uruguayans.

00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:09.750
We crashed in the mountains.
Is anybody there?

00:17:10.375 --> 00:17:11.458
Does this even work?

00:17:11.541 --> 00:17:14.708
- Huh? What?
- [weakly] We passed Curicó.

00:17:15.208 --> 00:17:16.208
What do you mean?

00:17:16.291 --> 00:17:17.833
We're past Curicó.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.250
What about Curicó?

00:17:20.333 --> 00:17:22.458

- [wind whistling]
- [somber string music playing]

00:17:59.375 --> 00:18:01.583
[Numa] The night hits like an ambush.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.541
In the span of minutes,
temperature drops 86 degrees.

00:18:09.208 --> 00:18:11.916
If the plane crash didn't kill us,
the cold will.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
[cries of pain and panic]

00:18:16.166 --> 00:18:17.583

00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:23.666
Living and dead... as one.

00:18:24.166 --> 00:18:26.166

- [moans]
- [takes a breath] I'm going home now.

00:18:38.458 --> 00:18:41.541
Your passport! Give me your passport!
Your passport!

00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:43.875
Grab my hand tighter.

00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:46.625
[Numa] That's how we spend the night.

00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:48.958
Nobody fall asleep!
You'll freeze to death!

00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:51.458
- [Numa] The injured scream.
- [Marcelo] Come on!

00:18:51.541 --> 00:18:53.500
[Numa] So do the rest of us.

00:18:53.583 --> 00:18:56.041
Let go of me! Mommy!

00:18:56.666 --> 00:18:58.208
[crying] Mommy!

00:18:58.291 --> 00:18:59.166
Hold me.

[somber string music building]

00:19:03.875 --> 00:19:05.416
Tighter, Pancho.

00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:10.083
[Abal coughs]

00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:12.625
[shakily] Help me. Help me.

00:19:12.708 --> 00:19:14.875
[spluttering] Help.

00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.625
[shivering] Help!

00:19:16.708 --> 00:19:18.666
[silence falls]

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.750

[Numa sighs, relieved]

00:20:01.083 --> 00:20:04.291
We're still alive, Pancho. [laughs]

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:11.041
[rattling reverberates across valley]

00:20:13.708 --> 00:20:15.708

00:20:57.416 --> 00:20:59.416
[both shivering]

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.166
You got another one?

00:21:11.666 --> 00:21:12.791
Do we know where we are?

00:21:14.083 --> 00:21:15.166
No, not yet.

00:21:15.666 --> 00:21:18.833
Marcelo. We lost three more.
Pancho Abal and Martínez Lamas.

00:21:18.916 --> 00:21:20.791
And the lady who was screaming.

00:21:21.916 --> 00:21:24.333
Gastón got sucked out
when the tail broke off.

00:21:25.041 --> 00:21:29.208
Also, my cousin Daniel
and Guido and Alexis.

00:21:29.291 --> 00:21:30.333
[music fades]

00:21:30.416 --> 00:21:31.625
Nando may not make it.

00:21:32.916 --> 00:21:34.291
His sister's really weak.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
We don't have anywhere
to take care of the injured.

00:21:37.083 --> 00:21:39.750
[sighs] Let's make room inside the plane.

00:21:40.916 --> 00:21:43.875
Let's take out the seats
so we can all fit in there.

00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:47.750
[both grunting]

00:21:47.833 --> 00:21:50.000
[somber instrumental music playing]

00:21:50.083 --> 00:21:51.083
C'mon, guys. C'mon.

00:21:51.166 --> 00:21:52.750
[group panting]

00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:54.708
[Marcelo] We need
to prioritize the injured.

00:21:54.791 --> 00:21:58.000
So let's clean up this side of the plane.
That's where the sun is.

00:21:58.083 --> 00:22:01.916
We'll take anyone who's hurt over there
and help them as much as we can.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.559
- [Marcelo] Platero!
- Yeah?

00:22:05.583 --> 00:22:09.000
Anything you find that might be useful,
put in a suitcase. Okay?

00:22:09.083 --> 00:22:10.958
See if you can find
any food in the luggage.

00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:14.333
Anything you find,
put in a single suitcase.

00:22:22.291 --> 00:22:23.666

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:25.208
What do we do with the dead?

00:22:26.166 --> 00:22:29.416
We put them over there, on that side.

- [Carlitos] No. Isn't there a bigger one?

00:24:11.916 --> 00:24:14.583
- That one there. Roy!
- [man 2] No! Don't touch it.

00:24:14.666 --> 00:24:17.291
[Carlitos] See if you can find rags,
coats, clothes.

- [Roy] Come on.

00:24:22.208 --> 00:24:24.934
- [Carlitos] Look for fabric, clothes...
- [Marcelo] Give me that one.

00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:28.083
[Roy] Coco! Take this. It's bigger.

00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:29.541
How many are gonna die tonight?

00:24:30.666 --> 00:24:32.291
No one's gonna die, Carlitos.

00:24:32.958 --> 00:24:34.208
I promise.

00:24:34.291 --> 00:24:36.125
- [Roy] Pancho! More bags!
- [wind picks up]

[Numa] Fito Strauch
isn't as optimistic as Marcelo.

00:25:24.458 --> 00:25:25.833
He's a reasonable man.

00:25:26.708 --> 00:25:28.791
He would never go against the captain.

00:25:31.041 --> 00:25:33.083
But he doesn't like what he sees.

00:25:36.291 --> 00:25:39.083
This is a place where life is impossible.

00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:45.083

We heard them today,
but we couldn't see them.

00:30:47.208 --> 00:30:49.083
They're probably searching somewhere else.

00:30:49.166 --> 00:30:50.726
If they're looking, they didn't see us.

- Faith? What faith?

Don't talk this way
in front of the younger guys.

00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:01.916
If you tell them,
you'll destroy their morale.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:06.083
You guys are the oldest ones here,
and you have a responsibility.

00:31:07.208 --> 00:31:08.541

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.916

- We won't last like this.
- How long can we survive?

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.208
- [Roberto] Know the rule of three?
- [Fito] No.

00:31:22.291 --> 00:31:24.000
[Roberto] Three minutes without air,

00:31:24.083 --> 00:31:26.958
three days without water,
and three weeks without food.

00:31:27.041 --> 00:31:28.791
Three weeks without food?

00:31:28.875 --> 00:31:30.666
I haven't eaten in three days.
I'm starving.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:33.625
It's a lot worse here.
There's the altitude and the cold.

00:31:33.708 --> 00:31:36.458
We're burning three
or four times as many calories.

00:31:36.541 --> 00:31:38.541
Roque told us about the batteries.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.900
They were in the tail of the plane.

00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:45.583
In my opinion, we should go up there,
where the plane crashed,

00:31:46.083 --> 00:31:47.750
and get the radio working.

00:31:49.375 --> 00:31:50.291

[Numa] Last night,
we split what we had left.

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:03.708
A pack of crackers.

00:34:04.458 --> 00:34:05.750
There's nothing else.

to tell me something.

He says that Nando's losing his mind.

00:35:31.625 --> 00:35:34.958
Last night, he went up to him
and said he wasn't gonna starve to death.

00:35:35.041 --> 00:35:36.541
I'm not gonna starve to death.

00:35:36.625 --> 00:35:38.541
[Fito] That he'd eat the bodies
if he had to.

00:35:38.625 --> 00:35:40.833
If I have to, I'll eat the bodies.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.208
I told him
that we don't have another option.

00:36:01.375 --> 00:36:03.958
If we wanna get rescued,
we gotta stay alive.

00:36:07.083 --> 00:36:09.208
And to stay alive, we need to eat.

00:36:14.583 --> 00:36:17.250

00:36:40.458 --> 00:36:42.041
We're dying.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.208
We're starving, and they're not coming.

00:36:47.083 --> 00:36:50.791
- We're wasting ourselves away.
- Seven days and nights without food.

00:36:51.291 --> 00:36:53.875
Nothing. If we don't eat, we're gonna die.

00:36:54.541 --> 00:36:55.625
Eat what?

00:36:58.708 --> 00:37:00.458
Are you crazy, Roberto?

00:37:00.541 --> 00:37:02.666
You gonna make everyone else crazy too?

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.916
There's food outside.

00:37:10.916 --> 00:37:13.166
[Roberto] There's protein outside.
Energy that we need.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:15.041
Do you know what's crazy?
To go on like this!

00:37:15.125 --> 00:37:16.125
Roberto!

00:37:19.583 --> 00:37:22.500
Roberto's right. We're talking
about living or dying, Marcelo.

00:37:22.583 --> 00:37:25.208
And if help arrives
in two days, then what, Fito?

00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:26.875
Can't we wait a couple more days?

00:37:26.958 --> 00:37:29.375
- Know what happens when you stop eating?
- Roberto!

00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:34.208
The body dries out. Just like plants.

00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:36.916
You can't use your brain.
Because it dries out too, Marcelo.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.583
- My pee is black.
- Yeah, my pee is black too.

00:37:39.666 --> 00:37:40.958
If we do it...

00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:44.750
what will happen to us?
Will God forgive us?

00:37:44.833 --> 00:37:47.500
God put us in this situation.
He'll understand we need to survive.

00:37:47.583 --> 00:37:49.583
God has nothing to do with this.

00:37:49.666 --> 00:37:51.125
I'm sorry, Marcelo.

00:37:51.208 --> 00:37:52.875
It's luck that brought us here.

00:37:52.958 --> 00:37:54.375
- Bad luck.
- [Arturo] It's meat.

00:37:54.458 --> 00:37:57.375
- It's people we love, Arturo.
- And how do you cut up a body?

00:37:58.125 --> 00:37:59.666
And who would even do it?

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:05.083
[Fito sighs] Me.

00:38:07.291 --> 00:38:08.458
[quietly] I'll do it.

00:38:08.958 --> 00:38:11.583
- I will too.
- [woman] I'm not eating them.

00:38:12.625 --> 00:38:14.250
That's something I refuse to do.

00:38:15.541 --> 00:38:17.666
Is it legal to eat a dead person?

00:38:18.166 --> 00:38:19.916
Won't we go to prison if we do it?

00:38:20.416 --> 00:38:23.291
- It would be like organ donation.
- What's wrong with you?

00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:27.333
For it to be organ donation,
you need to have the donor's consent.

00:38:27.416 --> 00:38:29.375
It's a crime, Marcelo.

00:38:29.458 --> 00:38:33.208
We can't just take, defile, and desecrate
someone's body without consent.

00:38:33.291 --> 00:38:35.791
- We need to eat, Numa.
- We don't have the right to.

00:38:35.875 --> 00:38:38.791
And don't I have the right
to do everything I can to survive?

00:38:42.125 --> 00:38:43.875
Who's gonna take that from me? You?

00:38:54.666 --> 00:38:56.458
- [crying]
- [Marcelo sniffles]

00:38:56.541 --> 00:38:58.541
[Pancho sobbing]

00:39:04.916 --> 00:39:06.291
[sobs, sniffles]

00:39:06.375 --> 00:39:08.375
[frozen wind howling]

00:39:21.875 --> 00:39:23.875
[Numa breathing shakily]

00:39:29.958 --> 00:39:33.666
[haunting instrumental music playing]

00:40:26.333 --> 00:40:30.291
- [fuselage creaking]
- [wind howling outside]

00:40:45.625 --> 00:40:47.625
[labored breathing]

00:40:50.125 --> 00:40:51.916
[Susy exhales heavily]

00:40:58.333 --> 00:40:59.375
Susy?

00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:02.583
Susy. Susy, breathe.

00:41:03.166 --> 00:41:04.833
No, no, no. Susana.

00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:08.250
Susana, come on. No. No. Gustavo!

00:41:08.875 --> 00:41:10.333
Gustavo, help me, please.

00:41:10.875 --> 00:41:13.583
- Susana. Please help me!
- [Gustavo] What's wrong?

00:41:13.666 --> 00:41:15.346
[Nando] She's not breathing. I don't know.

00:41:15.375 --> 00:41:17.875
[Gustavo] Okay. Put her legs over there.
I'll hold her head.

00:41:17.958 --> 00:41:20.583
[Nando] Roberto.
She's not breathing, Roberto.

00:41:20.666 --> 00:41:22.706
- Help her.
- [Roberto] Bring her here. Right there.

00:41:23.291 --> 00:41:25.541
Help me, Gustavo! Hurry!

00:41:25.625 --> 00:41:27.958
- [Gustavo] She's not breathing.
- [Roberto] Susy!

00:41:28.708 --> 00:41:30.958
[Numa] Coco Nicolich
wrote a letter to his parents.

00:41:31.041 --> 00:41:33.041
[somber piano music playing]

00:41:35.166 --> 00:41:36.583
[Numa] "Dear Mom and Dad,

00:41:37.708 --> 00:41:40.916
I'm writing to you
eight days after the plane crashed."

00:41:45.208 --> 00:41:46.833
"We're in a beautiful place,

00:41:47.833 --> 00:41:51.333
completely surrounded by mountains,
with a lake nearby,

00:41:51.416 --> 00:41:53.958
that will unfreeze when the thaw starts."

00:41:56.041 --> 00:41:57.250
"We're all doing fine."

00:41:58.541 --> 00:42:01.208
"As of now, there are 27 survivors."

00:42:03.083 --> 00:42:06.083
"Nando Parrado's sister
passed away today."

00:42:08.666 --> 00:42:10.208
"I miss you very much."

00:42:10.291 --> 00:42:13.166
[wind gusting]

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:15.458
[Numa] "And I'm constantly praying to God,

00:42:17.125 --> 00:42:20.708
that he at least
lets me see you one last time."

00:42:33.958 --> 00:42:35.958
[wind picks up]

00:42:41.291 --> 00:42:42.791
This is a cemetery.

00:42:46.791 --> 00:42:47.875
[exhales resolutely]

00:42:48.958 --> 00:42:50.541
And I'm not staying here.

00:42:53.958 --> 00:42:55.958
[thunder rumbling in distance]

00:42:58.625 --> 00:42:59.958
[thunder crashes]

00:43:00.041 --> 00:43:02.000
[man] It hurts! My stomach hurts!

00:43:02.083 --> 00:43:04.250
[woman] I know, Moncho.
You need to calm down.

00:43:04.333 --> 00:43:06.291
- Just breathe.
- I can't breathe. [sobs]

00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:09.291
Look at me, Moncho. Look at me. Breathe.

00:43:09.375 --> 00:43:10.791
- I don't want to!
- Just breathe.

00:43:10.875 --> 00:43:13.500
- [Moncho] I can't! I can't! Help me!
- [woman] Yes, you can.

00:43:13.583 --> 00:43:14.583
Look at me and breathe!

00:43:14.666 --> 00:43:17.000
[Moncho] I gotta get outta here!
I'm suffocating!

00:43:17.083 --> 00:43:20.125
[woman] You can't go outside now, Moncho.
Look at me. You have to calm down.

00:43:20.208 --> 00:43:22.892
- [Moncho] I don't want to die here.
- [woman] You're not going to die.

00:43:22.916 --> 00:43:25.756
- [Moncho] I don't want to die here!
- [woman] You're not dying, Moncho.

OCTOBER 21, 1972

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:33.375
[all shivering]

00:43:41.958 --> 00:43:44.833
If I die,
I give you permission to feed on my body.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.000
So you can keep on living.

00:43:55.541 --> 00:43:57.750
I give you my consent as well.

00:43:58.333 --> 00:43:59.333
And you have mine.

00:44:00.333 --> 00:44:01.708
You also have my permission.

00:44:24.125 --> 00:44:26.083
[tense music playing]

00:44:26.166 --> 00:44:29.375
[Moncho] Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:33.916
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.416
Give us this day our daily bread.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.666
And forgive us our trespasses

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:38.833
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

00:44:38.916 --> 00:44:41.666
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:44.000
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

00:44:44.083 --> 00:44:44.958
Thy kingdom come.

00:44:45.041 --> 00:44:47.000
Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

00:44:47.083 --> 00:44:49.000
Give us this day our daily bread.

00:44:49.083 --> 00:44:50.541
And forgive us our trespasses

00:44:50.625 --> 00:44:52.750

And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

On earth as it is in heaven.

00:44:58.041 --> 00:45:00.561
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses.

00:45:00.625 --> 00:45:02.875
- [gasps]
- [Moncho] And lead us not into temptation.

00:45:02.958 --> 00:45:04.791
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

00:45:04.875 --> 00:45:06.416
[crying softly]

00:45:14.916 --> 00:45:16.041
[Nando grunts]

00:45:24.125 --> 00:45:26.000
I'm sorry. [sniffles]

00:45:34.125 --> 00:45:35.541
[Roque] Sorry, Marcelo.

00:45:37.916 --> 00:45:39.125
[Marcelo sniffles]

00:45:39.208 --> 00:45:40.666
[man 1] Sorry, Marcelo.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:46.166
[man 2] Will God forgive us?

00:45:48.083 --> 00:45:50.666
[man 3] We don't have a choice.
I'm sorry, Marcelo.

00:45:54.208 --> 00:45:56.041
[Marcelo breathing shakily]

00:46:00.041 --> 00:46:02.041
[panting]

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:20.708
[sighs]

00:46:30.166 --> 00:46:32.166
[somber instrumental music playing]

00:46:47.166 --> 00:46:49.500
[shivering] Don't give me
that look, Coche.

00:46:52.875 --> 00:46:54.791
I'm not giving you a look.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.250
[shudders]

00:47:08.166 --> 00:47:09.333
[group grunting]

00:47:15.791 --> 00:47:18.875
[Numa] The Strauch cousins
have the most difficult job.

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:22.958
The one no one wants to do.

00:47:24.625 --> 00:47:26.458
Fito chooses the bodies.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.916
And they cut them up in secret.

00:47:32.458 --> 00:47:34.375
Away from everyone else.

00:47:36.625 --> 00:47:39.291
That's how they keep
the ones who eat sane.

00:47:46.833 --> 00:47:48.833
[somber music swells]

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:58.750
Hey!

00:47:58.791 --> 00:48:00.750
- [Coco] What?
- [Coche] I found something!

00:48:05.125 --> 00:48:06.250
[Roy] A radio!

00:48:09.416 --> 00:48:10.708
It's all wet.

00:48:11.208 --> 00:48:12.666
Come on, Roy. Fix it.

00:48:22.125 --> 00:48:24.583
[Numa] Those of us who don't eat
keep watching the sky.

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:30.250
Waiting for a sign.

00:48:31.333 --> 00:48:34.708
- [static crackles]
- [indistinct radio chatter]

00:48:40.666 --> 00:48:42.000
[Coco] Left or right?

00:48:43.583 --> 00:48:44.458
Higher, Coco.

00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:46.501
If you want it higher,
we'll need to get more wire

00:48:46.541 --> 00:48:48.958
and tie it to a pole or something.

00:48:50.041 --> 00:48:53.250
[Roy] Hold it there.
A little bit to the left.

00:48:54.625 --> 00:48:55.875
A bit more.

00:48:57.958 --> 00:49:00.083
Less. A little to the right.

00:49:00.166 --> 00:49:01.166
There.

00:49:04.375 --> 00:49:06.375
[indistinct chatter continues outside]

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.125
[Pancho sniffles]

00:49:22.791 --> 00:49:23.791
Take this.

00:49:27.291 --> 00:49:28.416
What is that?

00:49:30.125 --> 00:49:32.541
Eat it. It's easier with snow.

00:49:32.625 --> 00:49:33.916
[Numa] No, thank you.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.416
- I'll be okay.
- [Pancho sniffles, sighs]

00:49:38.583 --> 00:49:40.208
You have to eat, Numa.

00:49:44.625 --> 00:49:46.333
It's not right, Pancho.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000
[sighs]

00:49:50.333 --> 00:49:54.250
- [man 1 cries out] No!
- [Numa gasps]

00:49:56.125 --> 00:49:59.125
[screaming and sobbing outside]

00:49:59.875 --> 00:50:02.375
Why?! [screams]

00:50:02.458 --> 00:50:06.666
[reporter on radio] This is Spectator.
We're coming to you with new information.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.750
The search for the Uruguayan plane
that crashed in the Andean Mountain Range

00:50:09.833 --> 00:50:12.916
with the rugby team Old Christians,
has come to an end.

00:50:14.041 --> 00:50:16.083
In the ten days required by the protocol,

00:50:16.166 --> 00:50:19.375
66 search and rescue missions
were conducted,

00:50:19.458 --> 00:50:22.500
using 17 planes from the Chilean Air Force

00:50:22.583 --> 00:50:26.083
as well as aircrafts of the Uruguayan
and Argentinian Air Forces,

00:50:26.166 --> 00:50:27.916
but to no avail.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.708
Search efforts will resume
early next year,

00:50:31.791 --> 00:50:33.391
when the thawing of the ice will provide

00:50:33.416 --> 00:50:36.500
better conditions of visibility
to find the wreckage.

00:50:36.583 --> 00:50:38.875
The Chilean Air Force's rescue service

00:50:38.958 --> 00:50:42.916
has reported that, in the 34 air accidents
that have occurred in the Andes,

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.166
no survivors have ever been found.

00:50:45.958 --> 00:50:48.666
We'll return with more news
after a commercial break.

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:50.750
[cheerful radio jingle playing]

00:50:52.166 --> 00:50:55.666
[announcer 1, in Spanish]
Made with premium quality parts.

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:57.791
Beautiful colors and designs.

00:50:58.625 --> 00:51:01.708
[announcer 2] Customizable,
with three different models.

00:51:01.791 --> 00:51:06.166
Bicicletas Victoria,
the leading bicycle brand.

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:08.000
[jingle fades]

00:51:08.083 --> 00:51:09.333
[in English] I was wrong.

00:51:11.708 --> 00:51:14.208
I begged you to wait
to be rescued for nothing.

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:20.000
But if I can ask you for one more thing,

00:51:22.458 --> 00:51:24.000
I'm asking you to eat.

00:51:24.083 --> 00:51:26.083
[tense music playing]

00:51:31.708 --> 00:51:33.125
[coughs]

00:51:33.208 --> 00:51:34.958
[breathing shakily]

00:51:39.166 --> 00:51:41.333
[Marcelo] The only thing we have left
is our life.

00:51:41.416 --> 00:51:43.500
And we have to fight for it.

00:51:44.333 --> 00:51:45.500
[Numa sighs]

00:51:45.583 --> 00:51:47.583
[ominous orchestral music playing]

00:51:54.791 --> 00:51:57.250
[Numa] We went up to look
for the tail of the plane.

00:51:57.333 --> 00:51:58.708
Without telling anyone.

00:51:58.791 --> 00:52:00.000
With no plan.

00:52:01.375 --> 00:52:03.875
We need to find batteries for the radio.

00:52:07.916 --> 00:52:09.916
[group panting]

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000
[Numa] Over there.

00:52:38.708 --> 00:52:39.750
[sniffles]

00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:50.750
[sighs deeply]

00:52:53.958 --> 00:52:55.333
I'm here, Gastón.

00:52:55.875 --> 00:52:57.875
[speaking inaudibly]

00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:27.500
[grunts]

00:53:29.083 --> 00:53:31.250
That's Daniel Shaw, Fito's cousin.

00:53:31.916 --> 00:53:34.250
He was behind me on the plane
and flew out.

00:53:34.875 --> 00:53:36.291
[Maspons] Sun's going down.

00:53:36.375 --> 00:53:37.833
- We should go back.
- No.

00:53:39.083 --> 00:53:40.708
Let's look some more. Please.

00:53:41.791 --> 00:53:45.208
If we found all these things here,
the tail shouldn't be far behind.

00:53:47.416 --> 00:53:48.958
[grunting]

00:53:52.041 --> 00:53:53.041
[groans]

00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:57.291
[panting]

00:54:01.166 --> 00:54:02.375
Who's up there?

00:54:03.291 --> 00:54:06.333
Numa, Gustavo, and Maspons.

00:54:07.958 --> 00:54:09.500
They left with nothing.

00:54:10.458 --> 00:54:12.958
The temperature up there
must drop 80 or 90 degrees.

00:54:13.875 --> 00:54:15.541
And it's gonna be night soon.

00:54:16.708 --> 00:54:18.708
[cold air rushes]

00:54:24.333 --> 00:54:27.333
[Numa] The sun had melted the snow,
and we were knee-deep in it.

00:54:27.958 --> 00:54:30.083
[Numa] No, that way!

00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:32.166
[panting]

00:54:38.333 --> 00:54:42.333
[Numa] We can barely keep going,
and the night traps us.

00:54:42.416 --> 00:54:44.416
[raging wind]

00:54:45.875 --> 00:54:47.583
Everyone, get closer! Get closer.

00:54:49.041 --> 00:54:51.375
[moaning]

00:54:51.958 --> 00:54:53.208
Calm down!

00:54:53.291 --> 00:54:54.750
Come on!

00:54:54.833 --> 00:54:56.750
Please, Lord,
don't let us freeze to death.

00:54:56.833 --> 00:54:59.166
[Gustavo] Shake the ice off my back!

00:55:00.625 --> 00:55:02.625
[all groaning]

00:55:02.708 --> 00:55:05.458
[freezing wind picks up]

00:55:05.541 --> 00:55:07.541
[silence falls]

00:55:11.333 --> 00:55:14.375
[wind gusting]

00:55:29.208 --> 00:55:31.208
[gasping]

00:55:39.333 --> 00:55:40.958
[groans weakly]

00:55:46.541 --> 00:55:48.541
[shivering]

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.500
[breathing shakily]

00:55:59.458 --> 00:56:01.708
[Numa] The more we try to get out,

00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:04.666
the more the mountain resists.

00:56:13.791 --> 00:56:16.416
[man 1 screams]

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:19.875
[man 2] Hey!

00:56:27.125 --> 00:56:29.208
[softly] Gus, eat.

00:56:32.416 --> 00:56:33.541
[Nando] So, Numa.

00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:37.000
What did you see up there?

00:56:42.791 --> 00:56:43.958
Numa.

00:56:44.041 --> 00:56:45.041
Tell me.

00:56:46.041 --> 00:56:47.791
Only snow and mountains.

00:56:48.458 --> 00:56:49.875
[Nando] In every direction?

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.958
[Numa] As far as I could see,
that's all there is.

00:56:54.041 --> 00:56:55.041
And to the west?

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:58.500
- See anything behind that ice wall?
- [Numa] No.

00:57:00.791 --> 00:57:02.416
You can't see anything.

00:57:03.833 --> 00:57:05.083
Chile's right behind it.

00:57:07.375 --> 00:57:08.750
We need to go there.

00:57:11.166 --> 00:57:14.416
But you gotta eat, Numa.
Or you won't make it to Chile.

00:57:20.625 --> 00:57:21.708
[Numa sighs]

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.833
[somber instrumental music playing]

00:57:38.416 --> 00:57:40.416
[breathing shakily]

00:57:52.875 --> 00:57:53.875
[quietly] Come on.

00:57:53.958 --> 00:57:55.125
[Numa sighs heavily]

00:58:01.958 --> 00:58:04.375
[crying softly]

00:58:18.125 --> 00:58:20.791
[Numa] I don't chew
more than two or three times.

00:58:22.875 --> 00:58:24.875
And I force myself to swallow.

00:58:35.083 --> 00:58:38.250
For the first time,
I imagine the possibility

00:58:38.333 --> 00:58:41.916
that feels increasingly real
of not getting back home.

00:58:45.333 --> 00:58:47.041
But I look at Nando, and I feel hope.

00:58:47.125 --> 00:58:49.125
[wind whipping]

00:58:50.416 --> 00:58:53.166
[Numa] He trains every day,
obsessed with one idea.

00:58:54.291 --> 00:58:58.625
Beyond that mountain
lie the green valleys of Chile.

00:59:00.458 --> 00:59:02.125
Climbing it is suicide.

00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:06.708
[frigid air rushing]

00:59:08.833 --> 00:59:10.166
[Numa] But I'm going with him.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.083
{\an8}DAY 17
FIFTH DAY OF THE STORM

00:59:16.625 --> 00:59:18.583
[group laughing and chatting]

00:59:18.666 --> 00:59:20.208
[man 1] Getting worse.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.750
Okay, Vasco. Check this out.

00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:26.625
- 'Cause your rhyme was all talk
- [chuckles]

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:30.958
Tell me, why don't you get up
And go out for a quick walk?

00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:32.583
[all laugh]

00:59:32.666 --> 00:59:34.250
[man 1] You're an idiot, Bobby!

00:59:34.333 --> 00:59:36.875
- [man 2] Okay, Carlitos.
- Yeah, Carlitos.

00:59:36.958 --> 00:59:40.583
We can barely fit 27 of us
But that's all right

00:59:40.666 --> 00:59:43.958
While we're all cramped in here
Up in the presidential suite, they're fine

00:59:44.041 --> 00:59:46.458
[all laugh]

00:59:46.541 --> 00:59:48.875
[Arturo] While a terrible tragedy unfolds

00:59:48.958 --> 00:59:52.666
I want to escape
Yet I see many heroes without capes

00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:54.166
- [all chuckle]
- Aww.

00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:56.541
And although sometimes
Anger overtakes me

00:59:56.625 --> 00:59:59.500
Standing by your side
Truly strengthens me

00:59:59.583 --> 01:00:00.958
- [man 3] Deep!
- Oh!

01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:03.666
Even though we're now freezing to death
On this plane

01:00:04.541 --> 01:00:06.708
I have Coco's warm feet here
And can't complain

01:00:06.791 --> 01:00:08.041
[both laugh]

01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:10.666
But, Coco
Don't get used to this situation

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:13.041
We gotta get back to Uruguay
Our beloved nation

01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:15.666
- [man 3] That's right!
- [Daniel] Come on, Coco. Go.

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:17.583
Okay, but mine's kinda sentimental.

01:00:18.708 --> 01:00:21.500
On October thirteenth
My mother's birthday I did miss

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:23.583
So I humbly ask God

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:26.083
To finally come home

01:00:26.583 --> 01:00:28.541
So I can give her a big kiss

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.065
- [man 4] Very sweet.
- [man 5] Nice.

01:00:31.666 --> 01:00:33.666
[Fito] There are some decent people
In this space

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:37.041
Yet some know not the candidates
For the presidential race

01:00:37.541 --> 01:00:39.666
They are a tremendous disgrace

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:41.458
[all chuckle]

01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:43.916
- [man 4] That was awful!
- [man 6] That's terrible!

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
- All right.
- [man 4] Terrible. The worst.

01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:47.375
At least I tried, you know?

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:49.250
- You guys didn't do anything.
- [all laugh]

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:51.916
Here in the mountains
The situation's intense

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:55.708
It makes me wanna start running
Like a puma

01:00:56.208 --> 01:00:58.208
But I will not leave this place

01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:00.791
Without first hearing a rhyme
From the reserved Numa

01:01:04.833 --> 01:01:06.541
[Numa] Uh... [chuckles]

01:01:06.625 --> 01:01:09.333
On, uh, this extremely freezing mountain

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:12.666
Where... not even a spider can walk

01:01:13.541 --> 01:01:15.166
[all chuckle]

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:18.291
In the... in the fridge

01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:22.166
On the mountain of the frozen fridge

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:23.458
- Forget it.
- [all laugh]

01:01:24.958 --> 01:01:26.625
Of the mountain... All right.

01:01:26.708 --> 01:01:27.875
- [all cheer]
- Bravo! Good!

01:01:27.958 --> 01:01:28.958
Come on, Numa!

01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:31.875
- [man 6 whistles]
- Bravo!

01:01:32.541 --> 01:01:35.750
- [cheering continues]
- Hey, I tried.

01:01:35.833 --> 01:01:38.041
[loud knocking]

01:01:39.875 --> 01:01:41.875
[low rumbling]

01:01:43.958 --> 01:01:45.958
[fuselage rattling]

01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:51.958
[all scream]

01:01:54.541 --> 01:01:56.541
[silence falls]

01:01:57.833 --> 01:01:59.833
[snow crunching]

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.041
[muffled screams]

01:02:09.541 --> 01:02:11.208
[gasping for air]

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:18.708
[muffled screams continue under snow]

01:02:24.916 --> 01:02:27.666
[survivors screaming indistinctly]

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:29.750
[wind howling]

01:02:31.625 --> 01:02:33.458
[panting]

01:02:34.416 --> 01:02:35.416
Roy!

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.500
[icy wind rushing]

01:02:51.041 --> 01:02:53.041
[shivering]

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
[man 2] Roy!

01:02:56.666 --> 01:03:00.375
- [man 1] Down there! Down there!
- Here! I'm here!

01:03:00.458 --> 01:03:03.250
[man 1] Dig! [grunting]

01:03:03.333 --> 01:03:04.625
[gasps]

01:03:06.166 --> 01:03:07.416
Fito!

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.000
[screams]

01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:10.625
- [man 2] Tintín!
- Hey!

01:03:10.708 --> 01:03:12.708
- [Fito] Hold on!
- [man 3] Hold on!

01:03:12.791 --> 01:03:15.833
[Fito] Hold on! Hold on!
Hold on! We're getting you out!

01:03:15.916 --> 01:03:18.291
[screams]

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:20.166
- [Roy] Coche, help.
- [Coche] Get him out!

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:22.625
- [Fito] Dig! Come on!
- [man 5] Hold on!

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:23.958
Hold on!

01:03:24.041 --> 01:03:25.208
[gasps]

01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:26.625
[man 6] Everyone, dig! Dig!

01:03:26.708 --> 01:03:28.791
[gasping for air]

01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:30.291
[muffled shouts]

01:03:30.375 --> 01:03:33.250
[Fito] Help! Help! Help!

01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:35.375
Hang in there, Numa!

01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:39.916
- Numa, I'll get you out!
- [Numa shouts, strains]

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
[sounds distort]

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
[shouts] No! Coco!

01:03:46.083 --> 01:03:47.583
[straining]

01:03:47.666 --> 01:03:49.083
[panting]

01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:50.291
[screams]

01:03:51.666 --> 01:03:52.833
- Over here!
- Coco!

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:56.250
[Javier] Liliana's down there!
Don't step on her!

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:58.541
Watch out! Liliana's down there!
For God's sake!

01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:01.416
Please, don't step on her!
Liliana's there!

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:05.041
Liliana, hold on! Don't step on her!
Liliana's down there! Please!

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:07.791
Don't step on her! Baby, I'll get you out!

01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:08.875
She's here!

01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:10.791
Coco! No!

01:04:10.875 --> 01:04:13.791
- Coco! Coco! Coco! Coco!
- [Javier] Help me!

01:04:14.958 --> 01:04:17.500
- [Carlitos] Coco!
- [all grunting]

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:21.083
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe!

01:04:21.166 --> 01:04:23.250
Breathe, baby. Breathe.

01:04:23.333 --> 01:04:26.750
[softly] Breathe! Oh God!
Breathe, baby. Please.

01:04:26.833 --> 01:04:29.250
Breathe. Oh, baby. Just breathe.

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:31.375
- [Carlitos] He's not breathing!
- [Javier] Breathe.

01:04:31.458 --> 01:04:32.458
[Carlitos] Hold on!

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.333
Please breathe. [kisses]

01:04:34.416 --> 01:04:37.791
- [sighs, crying] No, my love, don't go.
- [shouting continues]

01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:39.875
[fuselage rattling]

01:04:39.958 --> 01:04:41.416
[survivors scream]

01:04:43.291 --> 01:04:44.458
[man 6] What's that noise?

01:04:44.541 --> 01:04:46.875
[man 4] What's happening?
What's happening?

01:04:46.958 --> 01:04:47.958
[Numa] What is that?

01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:50.041
[low rumbling]

01:04:57.958 --> 01:05:00.583
[silence falls]

01:05:00.666 --> 01:05:01.958
[survivors grunting]

01:05:06.791 --> 01:05:08.791
[panting]

01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:14.750
[man 1] Come on.

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:18.851
- [man 2] There's air.
- [man 3] Oxygen's coming in.

01:05:18.875 --> 01:05:20.333
- [man 2] There's air.
- Yes.

01:05:22.333 --> 01:05:23.666
Is everyone okay?

01:05:24.166 --> 01:05:26.625
- Arturo?
- I'm alive!

01:05:26.708 --> 01:05:28.750
Javier's alive. Liliana's gone.

01:05:28.833 --> 01:05:30.750
- [Fito] Vasco?
- Right here. I'm alive.

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:33.666
- I'm alive too! It's Roberto.
- Yeah, I'm alive! It's Moncho.

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:35.250
Pedro Algorta here.

01:05:35.333 --> 01:05:37.375
[Fito] Diego? Diego?

01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:39.083
Diego's dead, Fito!

01:05:39.958 --> 01:05:41.666
He's gone. And Roque. Roque too.

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:42.875
Maspons couldn't make it.

01:05:42.958 --> 01:05:45.958
- It's Nando. I'm alive.
- Enrique and Juan Carlos are dead.

01:05:46.041 --> 01:05:47.521
- [Fito] Tintín, you okay?
- I'm here.

01:05:47.583 --> 01:05:48.708
Coco?

01:05:49.541 --> 01:05:52.458
- Coco?
- Coco's dead. This is Roy.

01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:55.583
- And Marcelo? Marcelo?
- [man 4] Marcelo!

01:05:55.666 --> 01:05:57.125
- [Fito] Marcelo!
- Marcelo!

01:05:57.208 --> 01:05:59.208
- Marcelo? [sighs]
- [man 4] Captain!

01:05:59.291 --> 01:06:00.541
[Fito, echoing] Marcelo!

01:06:00.625 --> 01:06:02.625
[ethereal chimes playing]

01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:09.541
[ice cracking]

01:06:09.625 --> 01:06:12.083
[Numa] Marcelo was buried.

01:06:14.458 --> 01:06:17.541
He stopped feeling cold
because he didn't feel anything.

01:06:19.708 --> 01:06:21.875
And to stop feeling here is a relief.

01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:28.125
For 17 days,
we've waited for a moment like that.

01:06:30.458 --> 01:06:32.166
A moment of calm.

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:37.000
A second of quiet.

01:06:38.916 --> 01:06:40.916
[music fades]

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.833
[wind howling above]

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:44.916
[fuselage creaking]

01:06:56.583 --> 01:07:00.291
- How much snow could we have on top?
- It could be the entire mountain.

01:07:02.041 --> 01:07:04.250
Everyone, pray! Right now!

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:06.750
[survivors] "And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus."

01:07:06.833 --> 01:07:10.125
- [group continues praying]
- [Numa] Today is October 30th.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.625
Today is my birthday.

01:07:14.416 --> 01:07:15.916
I'm turning 25.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.875
[creaking fades]

01:07:19.958 --> 01:07:22.250
[Numa] Today it's hard
not to think of home.

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:27.750
[somber instrumental music playing]

01:07:37.875 --> 01:07:40.625
[wind whistling above]

01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:51.291
If light comes in,
we shouldn't be too deep in the snow.

01:08:21.458 --> 01:08:23.125
How long do you think we'll be here?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
We can't go out until the storm's over.

01:08:32.708 --> 01:08:34.708
[fuselage creaking]

01:08:38.875 --> 01:08:41.708
[music dies out]

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:49.958
DAY 18
TWO DAYS BURIED

01:08:55.833 --> 01:08:57.833
[Numa] The hunger is unbearable.

01:09:01.833 --> 01:09:06.666
Till now, the Strauch cousins
have been able to make the meat just meat.

01:09:07.958 --> 01:09:09.416
Meat without a name.

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.916
Without a face.

01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:16.291
But that's impossible here.

01:09:19.958 --> 01:09:23.958
[Roberto] So what?
Are we gonna do nothing?

01:09:35.291 --> 01:09:36.333
[Gustavo] Roberto.

01:09:38.333 --> 01:09:39.625
[sighs]

01:09:43.125 --> 01:09:44.416
To survive, we gotta eat.

01:09:47.041 --> 01:09:49.416
[all breathing shakily]

01:09:56.666 --> 01:09:57.791
[Roberto sniffles]

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:12.666
[group crying]

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:14.958
[glass shard slicing]

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:21.375
[Numa sighs]

01:10:23.666 --> 01:10:26.041
[flesh tearing]

01:10:31.541 --> 01:10:33.291
[exhales shakily]

01:10:34.375 --> 01:10:36.375
[crying softly]

01:10:38.833 --> 01:10:40.833
[group breathing shakily]

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.708
Now you're letting yourselves die?

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:51.875
After all we've been through?

01:11:00.375 --> 01:11:02.375
[somber music playing]

01:11:14.833 --> 01:11:16.833
[chewing]

01:11:27.833 --> 01:11:29.083
[Numa exhales sharply]

01:11:29.166 --> 01:11:31.166
[crying]

01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:41.541
[Numa grunting furiously]

01:11:54.125 --> 01:11:56.541
We gotta get out. I'm not staying here!

01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:59.333
We gotta get out!

01:11:59.416 --> 01:12:01.208
[grunting]

01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:02.541
[glass cracking]

01:12:02.625 --> 01:12:04.833
[Numa] What else do you want?

01:12:04.916 --> 01:12:06.208
Stop, Numa!

01:12:06.291 --> 01:12:07.291
[Numa] Come on!

01:12:08.166 --> 01:12:09.208
[Arturo] Stop it, Numa!

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:10.291
[screams]

01:12:11.083 --> 01:12:12.500
- [inhales sharply]
- [Arturo] Numa!

01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:14.083
[Numa groaning]

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.500
[panting]

01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:32.541
{\an8}DAY 20
FOUR DAYS BURIED

01:12:44.291 --> 01:12:45.291
[straining]

01:12:52.958 --> 01:12:54.500
[gasps]

01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:55.583
[mouthing]

01:12:56.333 --> 01:12:59.291
- I see the sky!
- [bright string music playing]

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.791
Come on, Moncho. Go first. You're smaller.

01:13:03.875 --> 01:13:06.208
Go. Go, go, go.

01:13:09.375 --> 01:13:12.458
[grunts, yells]

01:13:19.541 --> 01:13:22.250
[grunts]

01:13:23.041 --> 01:13:24.291
The sun! [sighs]

01:13:26.041 --> 01:13:27.875
Help me! Come on!

01:13:27.958 --> 01:13:29.291
[panting]

01:13:31.458 --> 01:13:32.583
[strains]

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.458
[panting]

01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:43.041
[man 1 laughing, sighs]

01:13:44.708 --> 01:13:46.875
[man 2 exclaims]

01:13:51.583 --> 01:13:52.625
[sighs]

01:13:53.958 --> 01:13:55.083
We made it.

01:13:56.333 --> 01:13:59.208
[takes a deep breath]

01:13:59.291 --> 01:14:01.875
Hey! What do you see?

01:14:02.458 --> 01:14:04.208
Margarita's out here, Álvaro.

01:14:04.291 --> 01:14:06.666
- Your girlfriend!
- [man 3] In a bikini!

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:08.958
[Álvaro] Tell her I'll be right up!
[chuckles]

01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:12.208
- [man 4] We're alive!
- [man 5] We made it!

01:14:12.291 --> 01:14:15.666
[survivors cheering and shouting]

01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:24.500
[Coche] Hey! Come on!

01:14:29.916 --> 01:14:32.666
[wind whipping]

01:14:40.333 --> 01:14:42.166
[metal clangs]

01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:46.208
[grunts] The bottle. The bottle.

01:14:47.625 --> 01:14:49.625
[ominous string music playing]

01:14:55.708 --> 01:14:57.708
[music fades]

01:14:58.583 --> 01:15:00.166
[Arturo] How's the leg?

01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:04.250
[sighs] It's okay.
It's just a cut. I'll be fine.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.083
Save your energy, Numa.

01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:08.833
'Cause I don't have any left.

01:15:08.916 --> 01:15:10.750
[Numa] Don't say that, Arturo.

01:15:13.416 --> 01:15:14.416
Don't lose your faith.

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.708
I have more faith
than I ever had in my whole life.

01:15:17.791 --> 01:15:21.041
[chuckles] What, are you an altar boy now?

01:15:21.125 --> 01:15:23.833
- [chuckles, coughs]
- [Arturo] Don't laugh at me.

01:15:24.833 --> 01:15:25.958
[Roberto coughs]

01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:32.416
'Cause my faith...

01:15:34.125 --> 01:15:35.416
Sorry, Numa.

01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:37.916
...isn't in your God.

01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:42.625
Because that God

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:46.416
tells me what I'm supposed to do at home.

01:15:48.583 --> 01:15:51.166
But he doesn't tell me
what to do on the mountain.

01:15:52.291 --> 01:15:56.958
What's happening here
is a completely different situation.

01:15:59.125 --> 01:16:00.125
Numa.

01:16:01.083 --> 01:16:03.583
- [fuselage clangs]
- [Arturo] This is my heaven.

01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:05.958
I believe in another god.

01:16:08.291 --> 01:16:09.458
I believe

01:16:10.791 --> 01:16:13.625
in the god that Roberto
keeps inside his head

01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:16.791
when he comes to heal each of my wounds.

01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:22.791
In the god that Nando keeps in his legs

01:16:24.625 --> 01:16:27.125
and that lets him continue walking
no matter what.

01:16:33.041 --> 01:16:34.916
I believe in Daniel's hands...

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.500
when he cuts the meat.

01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:42.708
And Fito, when he gives it to us

01:16:44.583 --> 01:16:47.208
without saying which of our friends
it belonged to.

01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:50.125
That way, we can eat it without...

01:16:54.208 --> 01:16:56.166
without having to remember their faces.

01:17:00.291 --> 01:17:01.916
That's the god I believe in.

01:17:04.666 --> 01:17:06.291
I believe in Roberto.

01:17:07.958 --> 01:17:09.083
In Nando.

01:17:12.041 --> 01:17:13.041
In Daniel.

01:17:14.916 --> 01:17:16.208
In Fito.

01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:21.250
And in our dead friends.

01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:24.208
[sniffles]

01:17:26.166 --> 01:17:28.125
You're a philosopher, Arturo.

01:17:29.041 --> 01:17:30.333
[chuckles]

01:17:30.916 --> 01:17:32.416
Altar boy and philosopher.

01:17:33.333 --> 01:17:34.791
[sighs]

01:17:46.291 --> 01:17:48.000
[Coche grunts]

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:51.250
[man 1] Okay.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.208
- [man 2] Come on!
- [Nando] We have to go now.

01:17:54.333 --> 01:17:56.666
- Look at the sun.
- [Roberto] We need to wait.

01:17:57.166 --> 01:17:59.791
- [Nando] Wait for what?
- To be prepared.

01:18:00.583 --> 01:18:02.333
What if we get caught in a storm?

01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:04.875
We need temperatures to rise.

01:18:04.958 --> 01:18:07.041
We can't spend a single night
out in the open.

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:08.958
Tell him, Numa.

01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:11.583
[Pedro] The thaw starts on November 15th.

01:18:11.666 --> 01:18:14.041
There's a lower risk of storms
because temperatures rise.

01:18:14.125 --> 01:18:18.125
- [Nando] Two weeks... just waiting.
- No. Two weeks of preparation.

01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:22.458
So far, we've always gone out
without a plan, and we've failed.

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:25.333
We don't even know
what kind of distance we're facing.

01:18:26.208 --> 01:18:27.208
[Coche] Hey!

01:18:28.208 --> 01:18:29.666
We need help over here!

01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:32.375
- [man 3] Go grab those chairs!
- [Coche] Come on. Dig

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:33.500
[man 4] Come help.

01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:37.708
[Coche] All good? Grab those plates.

01:18:37.791 --> 01:18:40.041
- Yeah? Let's go.
- [man 5] Need help?

01:18:40.125 --> 01:18:42.309
- [man 6] How can I help?
- [Coche] Dig on the other side.

01:18:42.333 --> 01:18:44.708
[indistinct chatter]

01:18:44.791 --> 01:18:47.291
[Roberto and Nando speaking indistinctly]

01:18:55.666 --> 01:18:58.791
I don't get it.
I thought you didn't wanna die here.

01:19:04.416 --> 01:19:09.583
DAY 34
THE THAW BEGINS

01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:13.291
[water dripping]

01:19:18.125 --> 01:19:21.208
Help me, Roberto. Give me a hand.

01:19:21.291 --> 01:19:23.625
- [Arturo coughing]
- Watch it. Hold his head, please.

01:19:23.708 --> 01:19:27.000
- Very slowly. Lift him. There you go.
- [Arturo groaning]

01:19:27.083 --> 01:19:29.333
Slowly. Slowly. Slowly.

01:19:30.208 --> 01:19:32.541
- Easy, easy, Arturo. That's it.
- [coughs weakly]

01:19:32.625 --> 01:19:35.333
[Gustavo] Let's lift his shirt up slowly.
That's it.

01:19:35.875 --> 01:19:37.291
[Arturo groans]

01:19:40.833 --> 01:19:43.791
[coughs]

01:19:43.875 --> 01:19:45.208
[Gustavo] Arturo's really sick.

01:19:45.875 --> 01:19:48.916
He's got three days. Vasco, maybe five.

01:19:49.583 --> 01:19:50.500
What do you think?

01:19:50.583 --> 01:19:51.791
About what?

01:19:52.291 --> 01:19:54.958
- The days they have left.
- What do you want, Gustavo?

01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:57.083
- [guys shouting below]
- Say it.

01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.500
What is it?

01:20:02.291 --> 01:20:05.125
Roberto, there's nothing more
we can do here as doctors.

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:09.291
We're gonna end up becoming gravediggers.

01:20:11.583 --> 01:20:13.208
Now, I know how hard it is.

01:20:14.166 --> 01:20:16.416
But you're the strongest player
on the team.

01:20:17.833 --> 01:20:19.666
Now you have to walk for everyone else.

01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:21.500
[Roberto sighs]

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:23.583
[muffled panting]

01:20:23.666 --> 01:20:26.416
[crowd cheering]

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.583
[echoing] Pass it!

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:30.916
Roberto, pass it!

01:20:31.416 --> 01:20:34.125
- [group grunts]
- [Gustavo] Careful. Over there.

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:37.000
- [Arturo gasping for air]
- [Gustavo] Move him.

01:20:40.708 --> 01:20:41.958
Let's put him here.

01:20:50.041 --> 01:20:53.166
I'm here. I'm here. Breathe, Arturo.
Breathe with me. Come on.

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:56.666
[Numa] Arturo Nogueira's lungs
are filled with fluid.

01:20:57.791 --> 01:20:58.916
He can't hold on.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.875
[gently] There you go. There you go.

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:05.541
- [Numa] Gustavo tries to help.
- That's it. There you go. There you go.

01:21:07.291 --> 01:21:08.811
[Numa] But no one can breathe for him.

01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:11.833
[Gustavo] Good job. Good job.

01:21:15.958 --> 01:21:20.083
- [wind howling outside]
- [Gustavo] There you go. There you go.

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:48.250
[foreboding instrumental music playing]

01:21:56.416 --> 01:21:57.416
[Numa grunts]

01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:02.208
[Numa] We have to try everything.

01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:12.750
Four of us volunteer.

01:22:16.333 --> 01:22:18.750
We head downhill towards Argentina.

01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:23.208
{\an8}With warmer clothes...
in the hope of surviving a night outside.

01:22:23.291 --> 01:22:24.958
{\an8}DAY 36
EXPEDITION EAST, ARGENTINA

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:36.083
[all panting]

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.333
[Numa grunts]

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.041
[moans]

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:02.750
[Nando] Numa!

01:23:03.166 --> 01:23:05.166
[Numa wheezing]

01:23:07.208 --> 01:23:08.375
[coughs weakly]

01:23:11.583 --> 01:23:13.250
[groans] Ow.

01:23:15.166 --> 01:23:17.625
[Roberto] Numa, you okay?

01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:19.500
[Numa grunts]

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.500
[Roberto] It's infected.

01:23:32.916 --> 01:23:34.083
Let's go back.

01:23:35.875 --> 01:23:37.125
We can't carry him.

01:23:39.958 --> 01:23:42.750
- [Nando] Roberto!
- I'm going back alone.

01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:49.041
The plane's still close.

01:23:55.708 --> 01:23:56.875
[Nando] Okay.

01:24:02.041 --> 01:24:03.083
[Numa] Sorry.

01:24:03.166 --> 01:24:06.250
[tense instrumental music playing]

01:24:34.958 --> 01:24:37.958
- [distorted] What happened?
- Numa?

01:24:38.041 --> 01:24:39.125
[echoing] Numa?

01:24:39.208 --> 01:24:41.166
Where are the others?

01:24:42.166 --> 01:24:43.958
Numa, answer me. Say something.

01:24:44.041 --> 01:24:45.833
[Daniel] It's okay. We're here.

01:24:45.916 --> 01:24:47.083
[Pancho] What happened?

01:24:51.458 --> 01:24:53.291
- [music fades]
- [crying]

01:24:53.375 --> 01:24:55.375
[Vasco] Where is he? My dad!

01:24:55.458 --> 01:24:57.916
- [Daniel] No, Vasco. We're here.
- [Vasco] Dad?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.101
- [Daniel] Calm down. We're here.
- [Vasco] Where's Dad?

01:25:00.125 --> 01:25:03.291
[Daniel] Look at me.
Look at me. Your dad's here.

01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:06.583
Look at me. We're here. We're here.

01:25:06.666 --> 01:25:08.166
[Vasco continues sobbing]

01:25:11.416 --> 01:25:13.791
- [Vasco] Dad! Dad, come here!
- Stop.

01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:17.583
Calm down.

01:25:18.708 --> 01:25:19.958
We're here.

01:25:21.333 --> 01:25:22.666
[gently] Vasco.

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:24.375
- Hey, Vasco! Look at me!
- [Vasco] Dad!

01:25:24.458 --> 01:25:27.500
[panting, sobs]

01:25:28.291 --> 01:25:32.291
[announcer on PA] Flight 328,
we are now boarding at gate ten.

01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:35.875
- Thanks.
- [Marcelo] Rafael... Rafael Echevarren.

01:25:35.958 --> 01:25:37.375
Huh? Echavarren!

01:25:37.458 --> 01:25:39.458
[somber instrumental music playing]

01:25:44.041 --> 01:25:46.500
[crying softly]

01:26:04.708 --> 01:26:06.291
[Numa] I don't understand, Javier.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.541
From the very first moment
we crashed in this place,

01:26:09.625 --> 01:26:11.666
I've tried to help as much as I could.

01:26:13.666 --> 01:26:14.708
I tried...

01:26:16.583 --> 01:26:18.666
to always do the right thing, you know?

01:26:22.625 --> 01:26:24.750
And now, with my leg like this...

01:26:28.791 --> 01:26:30.083
I'm useless.

01:26:34.916 --> 01:26:36.500
What does it all mean?

01:26:37.416 --> 01:26:39.708
What's the meaning of the death of Arturo?

01:26:39.791 --> 01:26:43.375
The death of Vasco?
Or the death of everybody else?

01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:53.916
Liliana gave everything. Always.

01:26:55.916 --> 01:26:56.916
[sighs]

01:26:58.291 --> 01:27:01.166
During the avalanche,
while buried under the snow,

01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.708
I could feel her body underneath mine.

01:27:08.208 --> 01:27:11.583
I remember there was only a few inches
between me and the surface.

01:27:11.666 --> 01:27:13.958
I could actually pull my head out, and...

01:27:14.041 --> 01:27:16.625
and shout at her
with all my strength I had.

01:27:16.708 --> 01:27:18.541
"Liliana, hold on!"

01:27:18.625 --> 01:27:20.541
"I'll get you out. I'm alive, love."

01:27:21.791 --> 01:27:23.583
I saw them stepping over where she was,

01:27:23.666 --> 01:27:27.208
and I shouted, "Oh, my God!
Don't step on her! Don't!"

01:27:27.291 --> 01:27:30.083
"Don't step on her, please!
Liliana's trapped below."

01:27:30.583 --> 01:27:31.958
[sighs deeply]

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.666
But there was simply no way to get her out
if I didn't get out first.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.208
But I was unable to move because my feet
were pressed against her chest.

01:27:45.208 --> 01:27:49.166
And if I pushed against her,
it would make her sink deeper and deeper.

01:27:55.208 --> 01:27:57.291
What is the meaning of that, Numa?

01:28:02.041 --> 01:28:07.208
[scoffs] When we finally got to Liliana,
she was just a lifeless corpse.

01:28:07.916 --> 01:28:10.541
At that moment,
as they kept digging up friends,

01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:13.666
one dead, one alive, one dead, one alive...

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:19.208
then... I hugged Liliana
with all my strength.

01:28:20.791 --> 01:28:24.041
And I felt a love
I'd never felt in my life.

01:28:24.125 --> 01:28:26.125
[gentle instrumental music playing]

01:28:31.291 --> 01:28:33.500
And I realized that I had a purpose,

01:28:35.291 --> 01:28:39.500
which was to take that love that
I was squeezing there against my chest...

01:28:41.250 --> 01:28:43.458
and bring it to my kids back home.

01:28:47.041 --> 01:28:48.916
Her death was not in vain.

01:28:53.791 --> 01:28:55.750
That wound doesn't make you useless.

01:29:05.458 --> 01:29:07.583
[inhales sharply, groans]

01:29:13.416 --> 01:29:15.416
[icy wind howling]

01:29:23.125 --> 01:29:25.166
[music fades]

01:29:27.333 --> 01:29:29.333
[panting]

01:29:32.916 --> 01:29:34.596
[Roberto] Someone ripped
all the parts off.

01:29:35.833 --> 01:29:37.851
- [Roy] Are you serious?
- [Roberto] Are you helping?

01:29:37.875 --> 01:29:39.166
[quietly] Nando?

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:41.875
They told me you've got lazy.

01:29:42.375 --> 01:29:45.166
That you sleep all day. Why?

01:29:46.125 --> 01:29:48.666
- You need to train, Numa.
- Why are you here?

01:29:49.416 --> 01:29:51.041
You're not gonna believe this.

01:29:51.833 --> 01:29:55.458
We walked for about
two, three hours, towards the east.

01:29:57.291 --> 01:30:00.958
Until, suddenly,
behind a hill, we found the tail.

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.208
I can't believe we found it.

01:30:05.541 --> 01:30:07.500
It... it catapulted itself forward.

01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:10.250
To the other side.

01:30:11.125 --> 01:30:12.333
It was amazing.

01:30:12.833 --> 01:30:15.500
It was completely full
of scattered suitcases, clean coats.

01:30:16.375 --> 01:30:18.000
We found bottles of rum.

01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:20.750
Cigarettes.

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:25.916
[softly] And chocolate.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.250
[Numa inhales shakily]

01:30:31.541 --> 01:30:33.916
Stop, stop, stop, stop. Not the wrapper.

01:30:34.416 --> 01:30:35.791
[clicks tongue]

01:30:35.875 --> 01:30:39.791
Now you're telling me
what to eat, man? [coughs]

01:30:40.625 --> 01:30:41.625
There you go.

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:43.583
Mm!

01:30:44.666 --> 01:30:46.375
[moans]

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.000
[Nando] You were right, Numa.

01:30:51.083 --> 01:30:55.666
We spent a night out in the open,
and we almost didn't make it.

01:30:58.958 --> 01:31:01.041
But we found the plane's batteries.

01:31:01.666 --> 01:31:03.750
- [electricity crackles]
- [gasps]

01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:05.291
[Nando] They were in the tail.

01:31:10.125 --> 01:31:12.250
It'll be much easier
to bring the radio here.

01:31:14.541 --> 01:31:16.458
Did you see Roy fixed the portable radio?

01:31:16.541 --> 01:31:19.458
And Roberto thinks he can get
that one in the plane to work too.

01:31:21.333 --> 01:31:23.083
We're going back down there.

01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:25.333
We need to try.

01:31:43.041 --> 01:31:45.041
[energetic string music playing]

01:31:50.125 --> 01:31:54.000
[Numa] Nando, Roberto and Tintín leave
with Roy towards the tail of the plane.

01:31:58.666 --> 01:32:00.333
I wish I could go with them.

01:32:04.916 --> 01:32:07.666
Roy is weak and doesn't think
the radio will work.

01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:10.083
Come on, Roy. Not a lot of time.

01:32:10.666 --> 01:32:12.083
[Numa] He's terrified.

01:32:13.625 --> 01:32:15.291
But he's doing it for the team.

01:32:24.833 --> 01:32:28.000
- [chuckles] I don't believe it.
- [Roberto] Nice, Roy.

01:32:37.208 --> 01:32:40.000
- 1-C-6-0-1.
- Which one is it?

01:32:40.083 --> 01:32:42.541
B... Not this one. What was it?

01:32:42.625 --> 01:32:43.708
Uh...

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:46.000
- One, seven.
- [Roy] Seven...

01:32:46.083 --> 01:32:47.166
What if it doesn't work?

01:32:48.416 --> 01:32:49.416
Huh?

01:32:49.791 --> 01:32:51.083
What do we do?

01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:52.833
I guess we start walking back.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.500
Right, Roberto?

01:32:56.208 --> 01:32:58.250
Toward the west. To Chile.

01:32:59.708 --> 01:33:01.166
[static crackles on radio]

01:33:02.416 --> 01:33:03.541
[Roberto] Hello?

01:33:05.583 --> 01:33:06.458
Hello?

01:33:06.541 --> 01:33:08.083
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:10.708
We're the Uruguayans
who crash-landed in the Andes.

01:33:10.791 --> 01:33:13.333
Can you hear me? We're still here!

01:33:14.333 --> 01:33:15.333
Hello?

01:33:20.083 --> 01:33:20.916
Hello?

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.375
[static crackles on radio]

01:33:22.458 --> 01:33:24.458
[tango music playing on radio]

01:33:24.541 --> 01:33:27.250
[indistinct chatter]

01:33:28.958 --> 01:33:31.083
[man] Uh, I don't know. I never tried it.

01:33:31.583 --> 01:33:34.833
- ["Zamba del riego" playing on radio]
- [Numa sighs]

01:33:36.416 --> 01:33:39.958
[Numa] With every day that passes,
we lose more of our strength.

01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:46.708
- [Numa sighs]
- [Pancho] It's okay.

01:33:46.791 --> 01:33:50.625
[Numa] The food rations aren't enough,
so we strip the bones of meat.

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:52.291
[news broadcast on radio]

01:33:52.375 --> 01:33:56.375
[Numa] What was once unthinkable
became routine.

01:33:56.458 --> 01:33:58.791
[reporter] ...number
of intercontinental ballistic missiles

01:33:58.875 --> 01:34:00.500
and other strategic offensive arms.

01:34:00.583 --> 01:34:02.333
[Numa] We just stopped caring.

01:34:05.375 --> 01:34:06.375
[Pancho] Come on.

01:34:07.916 --> 01:34:09.416
Here. Eat a little.

01:34:11.875 --> 01:34:13.000
You have to eat, Numa.

01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:29.750
Half and half.

01:34:32.583 --> 01:34:33.625
You can't give up now.

01:34:34.416 --> 01:34:36.416
No, I'm not givin' up, Pancho.

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:38.750
You know, I'm dying.

01:34:46.333 --> 01:34:47.458
And it hurts me to not...

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:50.791
not be able to do more for you.

01:34:50.875 --> 01:34:52.250
Don't say that.

01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:55.000
Think of yourself.

01:34:57.083 --> 01:34:58.750
You want me to think of myself?

01:35:02.416 --> 01:35:03.625
Look at me.

01:35:03.708 --> 01:35:05.958
I'm 25 years old, Pancho.

01:35:06.916 --> 01:35:10.333
I've got my enitre life ahead.
I've got everything left to do.

01:35:11.625 --> 01:35:15.250
I want to... see my siblings again.

01:35:15.333 --> 01:35:17.125
See my mother, my father.

01:35:17.916 --> 01:35:19.291
- I want to dance.
- [scoffs]

01:35:19.375 --> 01:35:21.333
- Numa, you don't dance.
- I know.

01:35:23.041 --> 01:35:24.208
But now I want to.

01:35:25.333 --> 01:35:27.083
I wanna do it all, Pancho.

01:35:29.291 --> 01:35:30.291
I want to laugh.

01:35:30.375 --> 01:35:33.000
- I want to cry.
- Then cry.

01:35:33.083 --> 01:35:34.541
- I can't.
- Cry.

01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:38.375
Do it. Come on, cry.

01:35:39.125 --> 01:35:40.166
Just cry with me.

01:35:41.083 --> 01:35:42.791
- [laughs]
- What's so funny?

01:35:42.875 --> 01:35:44.375
[chuckles]

01:35:44.458 --> 01:35:47.166
Cry with me. Come on. Let it go.

01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:49.875
[both crying]

01:35:51.833 --> 01:35:53.125
Do it, moron.

01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:56.083
Come on.

01:36:04.791 --> 01:36:07.291
[sobbing softly]

01:36:07.375 --> 01:36:08.708
[metal clatters]

01:36:21.625 --> 01:36:22.833
[Tintín] Nando!

01:36:22.916 --> 01:36:23.958
Look at this.

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.750
- What's that?
- It's waterproof.

01:36:32.375 --> 01:36:33.708
We can use it, yeah?

01:36:34.916 --> 01:36:36.708
It was covering some pipes.

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:38.958
- Is there more?
- [Tintín] Yeah. There's a lot.

01:36:39.041 --> 01:36:41.750
[Roberto] Two, four... One, C.

01:36:44.666 --> 01:36:47.541
- [electricity crackles]
- [Roberto gasps]

01:36:51.583 --> 01:36:53.166
[screams]

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:55.500
No! [grunting]

01:36:55.583 --> 01:36:58.166
[groans, sobbing]

01:37:00.333 --> 01:37:07.083
AS OF TODAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1972,
THERE ARE 17 MORE SURVIVORS UP ABOVE

01:37:07.166 --> 01:37:11.166
IN THE URUGUAYAN PLANE
THAT CRASHED IN THE MOUNTAINS

01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:19.333
[group panting]

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.041
[man] What happened?

01:37:29.875 --> 01:37:31.250
[Roberto] The radio didn't work.

01:37:32.625 --> 01:37:34.458
[Tintín] But we found this fabric there.

01:37:35.208 --> 01:37:38.000
- [Daniel] What's this?
- [Tintín] It's waterproof.

01:37:39.125 --> 01:37:42.416
- We can make a vest.
- [Roberto] No. Not a vest, Tintín.

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:43.791
Let's make a sleeping bag.

01:37:43.875 --> 01:37:47.750
With a sleeping bag, we could get
through the night. There's enough fabric.

01:37:49.291 --> 01:37:50.791
Or we could make a big one.

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:53.646
[Nando] When are we leaving, Roberto?

01:37:55.541 --> 01:37:56.708
[panting]

01:38:00.791 --> 01:38:01.791
Roberto.

01:38:02.916 --> 01:38:03.916
When?

01:38:06.541 --> 01:38:08.208
As soon as the sleeping bag is done.

01:38:08.291 --> 01:38:10.375
[reporter on radio]
58 days after the disappearance

01:38:10.458 --> 01:38:14.416
of the Fairchild 571 aircraft
from the Uruguayan Air Force

01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:17.333
with 40 passengers and five crew members

01:38:17.416 --> 01:38:20.666
chartered to transport a rugby team
from the Old Christians Club

01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:22.958
and their companions to Chile.

01:38:23.041 --> 01:38:27.166
The local Air Force has specially equipped
a C-47 aircraft

01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:30.458
to resume the search
in the Andean Mountain Range.

01:38:31.708 --> 01:38:35.250
[Nando] Come on, Roberto.
We can't go back to the beginning.

01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:37.708
[Roberto] They said they'll look for us.

01:38:37.791 --> 01:38:41.291
Those morons who flew right over
and... and didn't see us?

01:38:41.375 --> 01:38:43.041
They're looking for bodies.

01:38:43.125 --> 01:38:46.250
- We've been lost here for two months.
- [Nando] Two months, Roberto.

01:38:46.333 --> 01:38:48.583
Do you still believe
they think we're alive?

01:38:48.666 --> 01:38:51.291
- Well, we are alive.
- [Nando] Alive?

01:38:51.375 --> 01:38:54.416
Just look at us. Look at this.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.458
This isn't being alive.

01:38:56.541 --> 01:38:58.708
We won't make it
just by praying, you know.

01:38:59.208 --> 01:39:01.666
So you want to climb the mountain
sleeping in this?

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.041
[Fito] What are you doing, Roberto?

01:39:10.625 --> 01:39:12.916
- Stop!
- [Nando] Roberto.

01:39:13.416 --> 01:39:14.666
[Carlitos] You didn't like it?

01:40:28.083 --> 01:40:29.625
I'm gonna take a picture.

01:40:48.416 --> 01:40:50.833
[Numa] Tintín insists on taking pictures.

01:40:53.583 --> 01:40:57.375
Like he's capturing memories of a trip
that he's comin' back from.

01:41:00.166 --> 01:41:01.958
I wonder who these pictures are for.

01:41:02.541 --> 01:41:03.833
[camera shutter clicks]

01:41:03.916 --> 01:41:04.916
[Numa] For us?

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.208
Smile, asshole.

01:41:07.291 --> 01:41:08.958
[Numa] I'll never see them.

01:41:09.041 --> 01:41:10.666
Come on. We can still smile.

01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:15.750
Maybe they're for our families.

01:41:15.833 --> 01:41:18.958
Or for other people
who are remembering us now,

01:41:19.041 --> 01:41:22.000
looking at pictures of us
that were taken in the past.

01:41:22.083 --> 01:41:23.500
[Tintín] Carlos. Look at me!

01:41:24.541 --> 01:41:29.291
[Numa] And when they look at them,
we'll live again in their imaginations.

01:41:29.791 --> 01:41:33.791
Because they'll ask themselves
the same questions we're asking.

01:41:36.958 --> 01:41:39.291
- [camera shutter clicks]
- "What happened to them?"

01:41:40.416 --> 01:41:43.000
- [camera shutter clicks]
- [Numa] What happened to us?

01:41:45.791 --> 01:41:47.666
Who were we on the mountain?

01:41:49.583 --> 01:41:50.583
[Numa] Nando.

01:41:51.875 --> 01:41:56.875
I want you to know that
you have my permission to use my body.

01:41:59.333 --> 01:42:01.500
Stop fucking around. Don't say that.

01:42:03.833 --> 01:42:05.666
I'm know I'm not coming back.

01:42:09.583 --> 01:42:10.708
Don't say that.

01:42:12.208 --> 01:42:13.500
It's the truth.

01:42:15.875 --> 01:42:18.041
[takes a deep breath]

01:42:18.125 --> 01:42:19.375
But it's all right.

01:42:20.333 --> 01:42:22.000
It's fine. I'm at peace.

01:42:27.541 --> 01:42:29.583
I'm prepared for what's coming.

01:42:31.666 --> 01:42:33.458
We both are, my brother.

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:40.666
And I'm so happy
to know that you guys are gonna make it.

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:46.875
That makes me feel very happy, Nando.

so the food would last longer.
